of
fighting
this

is
never

to
it
to
plod

on
leaving

we
crossed
a
low
hill
into
the
seligun
valley
so
fair
and
solitary
a
month
ago
now
brown
and
dusty
and
swarming
with

and

and
lake

has
shrunk
into
something
little
better
than
a

a
path
at
a

elevation
above
a

and
a
short
rocky
ascent
brought
us
to
the
top
of

above

a

of
rock
with

altitude
of
feet
and
a

made

the
view
from
the
naghun
pass
of
the
great
ardal
valley
is
a
striking
one
though
not
so
striking
as
one
would
suppose
from
the
altitude
of
the
mountains
which
however
do
not
nearly
reach

of

a
grand
feature
of
the
landscape
from
the
naghun
pass
on
leaving
naghun
we
were
joined
by
aziz
khan
a
petty
chief
a
retainer
of
isfandyar
khan
who
has
been
deputed
to
attend
on
the
agha
and
who
may
be
useful
in
various
ways
between
naghun
and
ardal

elevated
ravine
a

of
which
might
well
be
mistaken
for

growing
abundantly
and
on
the

plain
the
sweet
sultan
and
the
have
taken
the
place
of
the
which
is
all
cut
and
stacked
a
hot
and
tedious
march
over
the
ardal
plateau
no
longer
green
and
eaten
up
by
the
passage
of
ilyat
flocks
brought
us
to
the
village
of
ardal
now
deserted
and
melancholy
the
great
ibex
horns
which
decorate
the
roof
of
the
ilkhani
barrack
giving
it
a
spectral
look
in
its
loneliness
the
night
was
hot
and
the
perpetual
passing
of
ilyats
with
much
braying
and
bleating
and
a
stampede
of
mules
breaking
my
tent
ropes
forbade
sleep
it
was
hot
when
we
started
the
next
morning
still
following
up
the
ardal
valley
and
the
karun
to
kaj
a
village
on
bare
hummocks
of
gravel
alongside
of
the
karun
a
most
place
but
higher
up
in
a
lateral
valley
there
was
a
spring
and
a
walled
orchard
full
of
luxuriant
greenery
where
we
camped
under
difficulties
for
the
only
entrance
was
by
a
little
stream
leading
to
a
low
hole
with
a
door
of
stone
such
as
the
afghans
use
for
security
and
through
which
the
baggage
could
not
be
carried
the
tents
had
to
be
thrown
over
the
wall
there
was
little
peace
for
numbers
of
the
kaj
men
sat
in
rows
steadily
staring
and
there
were
crowds
of
people
for
medicine
ushered
in
by
the
four
miles
above
ardal
is
a
most
picturesque
scene
which
though
i
had
ridden
to
it
before
i
appreciated
far
more
on
a
second
visit
this
is
the
magnificent
gorge
of
the
warkash
a
gigantic
gash
or
rift
in
the
great
range
which
bounds
the
ardal
and
kaj
valleys
on
the
north
and
through
which
the
river
on
whose
margin
the
camps
were
pitched
at
shamsabad
find
its
way
to
the
karun
a
stone
bridge
of
a
single
arch
of
wide
span
is
thrown
across
the
stream
at
its
exit
from
the
mountains
above
the
bridge
are
great
masses
of
naked
rock
rising
into
tremendous
precipices
above
the
compressed
water
with
roses
and
vines
hanging
out
of
their
clefts
below
the
river
suddenly
expands
and
there
is
a
small
village
now
deserted
with
orchards
and
wheatfields
in
the
depression
in
which
the
darkash
warkash
finds
its
way
across
the
kaj
valley
a
region
so
sheltered
from
the
fierce
sweep
of
the
east
wind
and
so
desirable
in
other
respects
that
it
bears
the
name
of
bihishtabad
the
of
geographically
this
has
a
great
interest
for
the
water
passing
under
the
bridge
is
the
united
volume
of
the
water
system
to
which
three
out
of
the
four
districts
known
as
the
chahar
mahals
owe
their
fertility
and
represents
the
drainage
of
square
miles
it
will
be
remembered
that
we
entered
the
chahar
mahals
by
the
kahva
rukh
pass
and
crossed
that
portion
of
them
lying
between
kahva
rukh
and
the
zirreh
pass
which
is
politically
not
geographically
a
portion
of
the
bakhtiari
country
and
is
partially
christian
i
started
at
five
the
next
morning
to
follow
the
left
bank
of
the
karun
for
nearly
a
whole
march
sometimes
riding
close
beside
it
among
then
rising
to
a
considerable
height
above
it
it
is
occasionally
much
compressed
between
walls
of
conglomerate
and
boils
along
furiously
but
even
where
it
is
stillest
and
broadest
it
is
always
deep
full
and
unfordable
bridged
over
however
at
a
place
where
there
are
several
mills
an
ascent
from
it
leads
to
the
village
of
where
the
people
were
very
courteous
and
put
me
on
the
road
to
a
village
not
far
from
the
river
at
the
foot
of
a
high
range
very
much
gashed
by
its
affluents
one
of
which
is
very
salt
is
quite
deserted
and
every
hovel
door
is
open
there
is
nothing
to
tempt
cupidity
the
people
when
they
migrate
to
the
high
pastures
take
all
their
goods
with
them
there
was
not
a
creature
left
behind
who
could
tell
me
of
a
spring
and
it
was
a
tiresome
search
before
i
came
high
upon
the
hillside
on
a
stream
tumbling
down
under
willows
over
red
rock
in
a
maze
of
campanulas
and
roses
the
first
essential
of
a
is
that
there
should
be
space
to
camp
and
this
is
lacking
my
servants
sleep
in
the
open
and
my
bed
and
chair
are
propped
up
by
stones
on
the
steep
slope
scorpions
processional
caterpillars
earwigs
and
flies
abound
it
is
very
pretty
but
very
uncomfortable
the
stream
is
noisy
and
a
rude
flour
mill
above
has
the
power
which
it
has
exercised
of
turning
it
into
another
channel
for
irrigation
purposes
there
are
some
large
ilyat
camps
above
and
from
these
and
from
the
people
have
been
crowding
in
the
wild
flowers
about
are
in
great
profusion
just
now
the
most
showy
being
hollyhocks
white
pink
and
mauve
which
affect
the
cultivated
lands
three
parasitic
plants
are
also
abundant
one
of
them
being
the
familiar
dodder
showy
varieties
of
blue
and
white
campanulas
a
pink
mallow
a
large
blue
geranium
chicory
the
blue
cornflower
and
the
scarlet
poppy
all
grow
among
the
crops
in
the
course
of
a
day
expedition
to
the
summit
of
the
pass
large
ilyat
camps
abounded
and
the
men
were
engaged
in
stacking
the
leaves
and
the
blossoming
stalks
of
the
wild
celery
for
fodder
later
in
the
season
these
attain
a
height
of
over
six
feet
these
and
the
dried
leaves
of
the
which
are
laid
in
heaps
weighted
down
with
stones
are
relied
upon
by
the
nomads
for
the
food
of
their
flocks
on
the
way
down
from
the
summer
to
the
winter
pastures
and
much
of
their
industry
such
as
it
is
is
spent
in
securing
these
crops
this
pass
feet
in
altitude
is
on
the
most
direct
route
from
isfahan
to
the
bazuft
river
but
is
scarcely
used
except
by
the
ilyats
it
is
in
fact
horribly
steep
on
the
side
the
great
bakhtiari
ranges
on
its
side
and
a
deep
valley
below
closed
by
the
great
mass
of
are
a
contrast
to
the
utterly
shadeless
and
mostly
waterless
regions
of
persia
proper
which
lie
eastwards
blazing
and
glaring
in
the
summer
sunshine
there
is
a
little
snow
and
some
ice
and
the
snow
patches
are
bordered
by
a
small
rosy
primula
delicate
white
tulips
and
the
violet
so
common
on
our
moorlands

the
khan
of
married
to
a
daughter
of
the
ilkhani
called
he
is
very
intelligent
has
some
idea
of
conversation
and
was
very
pleasant
and
communicative
he
says
the
bakhtiaris
love
fighting
and
if
there
a
fight
ca
help
taking
sides
and
if
they
have
not
guns
fight
with
stones
and
that
one
bakhtiari
can
beat
ten
persians
i
asked
him
if
he
thought
there
would
be
fighting
at
chigakhor
and
he
said
it
was
very
likely
and
he
and
his
retainers
would
take
the
ilkani
side
he
showed
me
with
great
pleasure
a
bullet
wound
in
his
ankle
and
another
in
his
head
where
a
piece
of
the
skull
had
been
removed
he
wishes
that
the
english
would
send
them
a
doctor
we
would
gladly
receive
even
a
he
said
mirza
politely
translated
this
word
christian
he
says
they
suffer
so
much
in
dying
from
want
of
knowledge
i
explained
to
him
the
virtues
of
some
of
their
own
medicinal
herbs
and
he
at
once
sent
his
servant
to
gather
them
and
having
identified
them
he
wrote
down
their
uses
and
the
modes
of
preparing
them
with
the
khan
was
his
prim
little
son
already
at
ten
years
old
a
bold
rider
and
a
good
shot
the
pale
boy
whom
his
grandmother
the
ilkhani
principal
wife
offered
me
as
a
present
if
i
would
cure
him
of
deafness
debility
and
want
of
appetite
i
gave
him
a
large
bottle
of
a
decoction
of
a
very
bitter
wormwood
into
which
i
put
with
much
ceremony
after
the
most
approved
fashion
of
a
charlatan
some
tabloids
of
and
of
permanganate
of
potash
when
i
saw
him
at
the
fort
of
chigakhor
he
was
not
any
better
but
since
probably
from
leading
a
healthier
life
than
in
ardal
he
has
greatly
improved
and
being
strong
is
far
less
deaf
and
consequently
the
virtues
of
wormwood
have
forced
themselves
on
the
khan
attention
the
boy
had
suffered
various
things
he
had
been
sewn
up
in
raw
sheepskins
his
ears
had
been
filled
with
fresh
clotted
blood
and
he
had
been
compelled
to
drink
blood
while
warm
taken
from
behind
the
ear
of
a
mare
and
also
water
which
had
washed
off
a
verse
of
the
koran
from
the
inside
of
a
bowl
it
transpired
that
the
khan
who
is
a
devout
moslem
and
a
could
not
allow
his
son
to
take
my
medicine
unless
a
piece
of
paper
with
a
verse
of
the
koran
upon
it
were
soaked
in
the
decoction
i
asked
him
why
the
bakhtiaris
like
the
english
and
he
replied
because
they
are
brave
and
like
fighting
and
like
going
shooting
on
the
hills
with
us
and
do
cover
their
faces
he
added
after
a
pause
and
because
they
conquer
all
nations
and
do
them
good
after
they
have
conquered
them
i
asked
how
they
did
them
good
and
he
said
they
give
them
one
law
for
rich
and
poor
and
they
make
just
laws
about
land
and
their
governors
take
the
taxes
and
no
more
and
if
a
man
gets
money
he
can
keep
it
ah
he
exclaimed
earnestly
why
do
the
english
come
and
take
this
country
if
you
do
russia
will
and
we
would
rather
have
the
english
we
tired
of
our
lives
there
no
rest
or
security
it
may
well
be
believed
that
there
are
no
schools
though
some
deference
is
paid
to
a
which
among
the
bahktiaris
means
only
a
man
who
can
write
and
who
can
read
the
koran
these
rare
accomplishments
are
usually
hereditary
the
chiefs
sons
are
taught
to
read
and
write
by
a
few
of
the
highest
khans
send
their
sous
to
tihran
or
isfahan
for
education
or
they
attend
school
while
their
fathers
are
detained
as
hostages
in
the
capital
for
the
good
behaviour
of
their
clans
there
they
learn
a
few
words
of
french
and
english
along
with
pure
persian
and
arabic
and
the
few
other
branches
of
the
education
of
a
persian
noble
they
are
fine
manly
boys
and
ride
and
shoot
well
from
an
early
age
but
the
worst
of
them
is
that
they
never
are
boys
they
are
little
men
with
the
stiffness
and
elaboration
of
manner
which
the
more
important
khans
have
copied
from
the
persians
and
one
can
never
fancy
their
abandoning
themselves
to
miscellaneous
impulses

we
left
the
last
village
of
the

to
enter
upon
a
country
not
laid
down
in

it

a
wild

of

rising
into

wide

by

and
green
with

and
in
part

is
very
solitary

at
times
we
come
upon

darker

and
then
cross
them
diagonally
they
do
not
manure
the
soil
but
prevent
exhaustion
by
long
fallows
after
they
come
up
to
the
mountains
they
weed
their
crops
carefully
and
they
look
remarkably
clean
in
reaping
they
leave
a
stubble
five
or
six
inches
long
there
is
a
good
deal
of
spade
husbandry
in
places
where
they
have
no
oxen
or
where
the
arable
patches
are
steep
the
spades
are
much
longer
than
ours
and
the
upper
corners
of
the
sides
are
turned
over
for
three
inches
a
spade
is
worked
by
two
men
one
using
his
hands
and
one
foot
and
the
other
a
rope
placed
where
the
handle
enters
the
iron
with
which
he
gives
the
implement
a
sharp
jerk
towards
him
in
the
higher
valleys
they
grow
wheat
and
barley
only
but
in
the
lower
rice
cotton
melons
and
cucumbers
are
produced
and
opium
for
exportation
they
plough
and
sow
in
the
autumn
and
reap
on
their
return
to
their
yailaks
the
following
summer
their
rude
water
mills
and
the
hand
mills
worked
by
women
grind
the
wheat
into
the
coarse
flour
used
by
them
it
appears
from
the
statements
of
the
aziz
khan
an
intelligent
son
of
chiragh
ali
khan
and
others
that
the
tenure
of
arable
lands
is
very
simple
and
well
understood
from
long
ago
certain
of
such
lands
have
been
occupied
by
certain
tribes
and
have
been
divided
among
families
some
of
the
tribes
possess
documents
supposed
to
secure
these
rights
granted
by
ali
mardan
khan
the
bakhtiari
king
of
persia
in
the
anarchical
period
which
followed
the
death
of
nad
r
shah
those
of
them
who
are
without
documents
possess
the
lands
by
right
of
use
nearly
all
the
tribes
have
individual
rights
of
tillage
and
have
expended
much
labour
on
their
lands
in
irrigation
and
removing
stones
a
fee
for
the
use
of
these
lands
is
paid
to
the
ilkhani
every
year
in
money
or
cattle
for
pasturage
there
is
only
the
right
of
use
and
wont
and
the
grazing
is
free
for
each
tribe
has
its
special
use
and
wont
subject
to
change
by
the
order
of
the
ilkhani
but
it
was
out
of
quarrels
concerning
these
and
the
pasture
lands
that
many
of
the
feuds
at
present
existing
arose
we
left
in
a
westerly
direction
followed
and
crossed
the
karun
left
it
at
its
junction
with
the
duab
ascended
this
short
affluent
to
its
source
crossed
the
at
an
elevation
of
feet
and
descended
feet
into
the
bazuft
or
rudbar
valley
where
the
camps
now
are
the
road
after
leaving
where
the
slopes
were
covered
with
pink
and
white
hollyhocks
keeps
along
a
height
above
the
karun
and
then
descends
abruptly
into
a
chasm
formed
of
shelves
of
conglomerate
on
the
lowest
of
which
there
is
just
room
for
a
loaded
mule
between
the
cliffs
and
the
water
at
the
narrowest
part
shadowed
by
shelf
upon
shelf
of
rock
the
river
shoots
through
a
narrow
passage
as
though
impatient
for
its
liberation
from
an
unnatural
restraint
and
there
is
what
i
hesitate
to
call
a
bridge
at
all
events
there
is
a
something
by
which
men
and
beasts
can
cross
the
chasm
a
rude
narrow
cradle
of
heavy
branches
filled
with
stones
quite
solid
and
safe
resting
on
projections
of
rock
on
either
side
the
karun
where
this
crosses
it
is
only
nine
feet
six
inches
in
width
i
found
the
zigzag
ascent
on
the
right
bank
a
very
difficult
one
and
had
sundry
falls
illustration
karun
at
face
vol
two
hours
more
brought
us
to
the
junction
of
the
karun
and
duab
two
rivers
above
which
the
former
is
lost
to
view
in
a
tremendous
ravine
the
latter
coming
down
a
green
valley
among
high
and
mostly
bare
mountains
on
a
gravelly
slope
of
one
of
which
we
camped
for
the
purpose
of
ascending
a
spur
of
a
lofty
mountain
which
overhangs
the
karun
on
such
occasions
i
take
my
mule
suleiman
the
most
surefooted
of
his
surefooted
race
who
brings
me
down
precipitous
declivities
which
i
could
not
look
at
on
my
own
feet
after
crossing
the
duab
a
green
rapid
river
by
a
ford
so
deep
as
to
be
up
the
bodies
of
the
mules
and
zigzagging
up
a
steep
mountain
side
to
a
ridge
of
a
spur
of
kaisruh
so
narrow
that
a
giant
might
sit
astride
upon
it
a
view
opened
of
singular
grandeur
on
the
southern
side
of
the
ridge
between
mountains
of
barren
rock
and
cleft
by
tremendous
rifts
lying
in
shadows
of
cool
gray
the
deep
bright
winding
duab
flows
down
the
green
valley
which
it
blesses
among
stretches
of
wheat
and
mounds
where
only
the
forgotten
dead
have
their
habitation
a
silver
thread
in
the
mellow
light
on
the
northern
side
lies
the
huge
formed
by
the
magnificent
mountain
kaisruh
on
its
right
bank
and
on
the
left
by
mountains
equally
bold
huge
rising
feet
perpendicularly
and
topped
by
battlements
of
rock
which
took
on
vermilion
colouring
in
the
sunset
glow
through
this
mighty
gorge
the
karun
finds
its
way
a
green
rapid
stream
below
the
ridge
and
visible
higher
up
for
miles
here
and
there
in
pools
everywhere
making
sharp
turns
in
its
stupendous
bed
and
disappearing
from
sight
among
huge
piles
of
naked
rock
even
on
this
splintered
ridge
at
a
height
of
feet
there
were
tulips
celery
in
blossom
mullein
roses
legions
of
the
anemones
blue
linum
and
a
wealth
of
alpine
plants
there
also
are
found
in
abundance
the
great
umbelliferous
plants
and
the
the
latter
i
have
never
seen
elsewhere
and
was
very
much
rejoiced
to
procure
some
of
its
tears
though
the
odour
will
cling
to
my
gloves
till
they
are
worn
out
hadji
had
heard
that
it
is
found
in
one
or
two
places
in
the
bakhtiari
country
but
up
to
this
time
i
had
searched
for
it
in
vain
there
also
for
the
first
time
i
found
the
the
gum
tragacanth
of
commerce
the
ordinary
tragacanth
bush
the
goat
thorn
the
which
is
found
everywhere
on
the
arid
hillsides
produces
a
gummy
juice
but
no
true
gum
and
its
chief
value
is
for
kindling
fires
following
up
the
duab
through
brush
of
tamarisk
and
indian
myrtle
above
the
cultivated
lands
and
passing
burial
mounds
with
their
rude
stone
lions
with
their
sculptured
sides
we
camped
in
a
valley
at
the
foot
of
the
and
close
to
the
powerful
spring
in
the
hillside
which
is
the
source
of
the
stream
where
there
was
abundant
level
ground
for
three
camps
the
next
evening
karim
the
man
who
so
nearly
lost
his
arm
some
time
ago
was
carried
past
my
tent
fainting
having
been
severely
kicked
in
the
chest
by
the
same
horse
that
lacerated
his
arm
i
unlucky
he
murmured
feebly
when
he
came
to
himself
in
severe
pain
i
have
crossed
the
twice
and
shall
cross
it
a
third
time
it
marks
a
great
change
in
the
scenery
and
the
first
intimation
of
possible
peril
from
the
tribesmen
the
ascent
from
the
east
which
is
extremely
rugged
and
steep
is
one
of
feet
in
three
and
a
half
miles
near
the
top
were
many
ilyats
camping
without
their
tents
a
set
with
immense
flocks
and
on
the
summit
the
agha
who
was
without
his
attendants
met
some
men
who
were
threatening
both
in
speech
and
gesture
from
the
top
there
is
a
wonderful
view
into
an
unknown
land
the
ranges
are
heavily
wooded
and
much
broken
up
into
spurs
and
rounded
peaks
between
the
great
range
crossed
at
a
height
of
feet
by
the
cherri
pass
and
a
range
of
mighty
mountains
of
white
limestone
with
snow
on
them
hardly
whiter
than
themselves
lies
the
bazuft
valley
feet
below
and
down
upon
it
come
sharp
spurs
often
connected
by
sharp
ridges
of
rocks
cleft
by
dark
ravines
with
glimpses
now
and
then
of
a
winding
river
flowing
at
times
through
green
lawns
and
slopes
of
grain
at
others
disappearing
into
gigantic
cañons
great
and
mountains
apparently
blocking
up
the
valley
at
its
higher
end
at
the
first
crossing
all
lay
glorified
in
a
golden
veil
with
indigo
shadows
in
the
rifts
and
white
lights
on
the
heights
the
first
part
of
the
descent
is
fearfully
rough
a
succession
of
ledges
of
broken
rock
encumbered
here
and
there
with
recently
dead
horses
or
mules
and
the
whole
downward
course
of
feet
is
without
a
break
the
climate
getting
hotter
and
hotter
as
one
descends
at
feet
the
oak
forests
begin
this
oak
bears
acorns
nearly
three
inches
long
which
are
ground
and
made
into
bread
all
other
vegetation
is
dried
and
scorched
and
the
trees
rise
out
of
dust
in
this
forest
we
came
upon
a
number
of
ilyats
some
of
whom
were
lying
under
a
tree
ill
of
fever
and
aziz
khan
insisted
that
then
and
there
i
should
give
them
quinine
at
the
bottom
of
this
unalleviated
descent
there
is
a
shady
torrent
working
a
rude
flour
mill
a
good
deal
of
wheat
speckled
with
hollyhocks
white
campanulas
and
large
snapdragons
some
very
old
tufa
cones
and
below
them
level
lawns
eaten
bare
fringed
with
oaks
with
dry
wood
for
the
breaking
and
below
again
the
translucent
rapid
beautiful
bazuft
but
not
even
the
sound
of
the
rush
of
its
cool
waters
could
make
one
forget
the
overpowering
heat
even
in
the
shade
of
a
spreading
tree
i
know
not
which
is
the
more
trying
the
ascent
or
the
descent
of
the
feet
of
ledges
and
zigzags
on
the
southern
face
of
the
the
road
is
completely
encumbered
with
stones
and
is
being
allowed
to
fall
into
total
disrepair
although
it
is
the
shortest
route
between
isfahan
and
shuster
things
are
undoubtedly
deteriorating
the
present
ilkhani
is
evidently
not
the
man
to
get
and
keep
a
grip
on
these
turbulent
tribesmen
i
notice
a
gradual
weakening
of
his
authority
as
the
distance
from
ardal
increases
when
hussein
kuli
khan
the
murdered
father
of
isfandyar
khan
was
ilkhani
he
not
only
built
substantial
bridges
such
as
those
over
the
karun
in
the
and
at
dupulan
but
by
severe
measures
compelled
every
tribe
using
this
road
in
its
spring
and
autumn
migrations
to
clear
off
the
stones
and
repair
it
as
it
is
nearly
all
our
animals
lost
one
or
more
of
their
shoes
on
the
descent
the
ascent
and
descent
took
eight
hours
some
of
the
cliffs
on
the
right
bank
of
the
bazuft
are
of
gypsiferous
rock
topped
with
pure
white
gypsum
resting
on
high
steep
elevations
of
red
and
fawn
coloured
earths
with
outcrops
of
gravel
conglomerate
yesterday
was
spent
in
a
very
severe
expedition
of
miles
from
mowaz
to
the
lofty
plateau
of
gorab
mostly
through
oak
forest
crossing
great
cañons
feet
deep
and
more
with
almost
precipitous
sides
descending
upon
the
awful
gorge
through
which
the
bazuft
passes
before
it
turns
round
the
base
of
the
the
monarch
of
this
mass
of
mountains
the
ascents
and
descents
were
endless
and
severe
as
we
crossed
the
mountain
spurs
it
was
a
simple
scramble
up
and
down
rock
ledges
among
great
boulders
or
up
or
down
smooth
slippery
surfaces
even
my
trusty
mule
slipped
and
fell
several
times
often
the
animals
had
to
jump
up
or
down
ledges
nearly
as
high
as
their
chests
and
through
rifts
so
narrow
as
only
just
to
admit
the
riders
in
some
places
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
walk
and
in
attempting
to
get
down
one
bad
place
on
my
own
feet
i
fell
and
hurt
my
knee
badly
a
serious
misfortune
just
at
present
after
twelve
miles
of
a
toilsome
march
the
guide
led
us
up
among
the
boulders
of
a
deep
ravine
to
the
treeless
plateau
of
gorab
an
altitude
of
feet
where
the
air
was
fresh
and
cool
the
scenery
is
on
a
gigantic
scale
and
the
highly
picturesque
bazuft
is
seen
passing
through
magnificent
cañons
of
nearly
perpendicular
rock
and
making
sharp
turns
round
the
bases
of
lofty
spurs
till
after
a
course
of
singular
beauty
it
joins
the
karun
at
shalil
it
is
glorious
scenery
full
of
magnificence
and
mystery
this
beautiful
which
for
a
long
distance
runs
parallel
with
the
karun
within
fifteen
or
eighteen
miles
of
it
is
utterly
unlike
it
for
the
karun
is
the
most
tortuous
of
streams
and
the
bazuft
keeps
a
geographically
straight
course
for
a
hundred
miles
springs
bursting
from
the
mountain
sides
keep
it
always
full
it
passes
nearly
among
lawns
and
woods
and
its
colour
is
everywhere
a
pure
of
the
most
exquisite
tint
contrasting
with
the
deep
of
the
karun
shuster
is
only
seven
marches
off
and
in
the
direction
in
which
it
lies
scorched
barren
hills
fill
up
the
distance
sinking
down
upon
yellow
barren
plains
softened
by
a
yellow
haze
in
which
the
imagination
sees
those
vast
alluvial
stretches
which
descend
in
an
unbroken
level
to
the
and
the
persian
gulf
many
a
lofty
range
is
seen
but
the
eye
can
rest
only
on
the
huge
gerra
mass
with
the
magnificent
snowy
peak
of
dalonak
towering
above
all
bathed
in
a
heavenly
blue
the
was
pitched
till
the
noonday
heat
moderated
abbas
ali
and
mehemet
ali
were
inside
it
and
i
was
reading
aloud
aziz
khan
was
lying
half
in
and
half
out
with
a
quizzical
look
on
his
face
wondering
at
a
woman
knowing
how
to
read
not
a
creature
had
been
seen
when
as
if
by
magic
nine
or
ten
lurs
appeared
established
themselves
just
outside
and
conversed
with
aziz
i
went
on
reading
and
they
went
on
talking
the
talk
growing
disagreeably
loud
and
aziz
very
much
in
earnest
half
an
hour
passed
thus
the
agha
who
understood
their
speech
apparently
giving
all
his
attention
to
i
did
not
hear
till
the
evening
that
the
topic
of
the
talk
was
our
robbery
with
possible
murder
and
that
aziz
was
spending
all
his
energies
on
dissuading
them
telling
them
that
we
are
guests
of
the
ilkhani
and
under
the
protection
of
the
shah
and
that
they
and
their
tribe
would
be
destroyed
if
they
carried
out
their
intention
they
discovered
that
his
revolvers
were
not
loaded
he
had
in
fact
forgotten
his
cartridges
and
one
said
to
the
others
do
give
him
time
to
load
while
the
tent
was
being
packed
i
sat
on
a
stone
watching
the
lurs
dark
handsome
savages
armed
with
loaded
clubbed
sticks
and
the
agha
was
asking
them
about
the
country
when
suddenly
there
was
a
and
the
semblance
of
an
attack
on
him
with
the
clubs
he
seemed
to
shake
his
assailants
off
lounged
towards
his
mule
took
his
revolver
from
the
holster
fired
it
in
the
air
and
with
an
unconcerned
smiling
face
advanced
towards
the
savages
and
saying
something
like
calling
attention
to
the
excellences
of
that
sort
of
firearm
fired
two
bullets
close
over
their
heads
they
dread
our
arms
greatly
and
fell
back
and
molested
us
no
further
till
later
i
did
not
know
that
the
whole
thing
was
not
a
joke
on
both
sides
aziz
says
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
agha
coolness
all
our
lives
would
have
been
sacrificed
in
returning
the
agha
walking
along
a
lower
track
than
we
were
riding
upon
met
some
lurs
who
thinking
that
he
was
alone
began
to
be
insolent
and
he
heard
them
say
to
each
other
strip
him
kill
him
when
their
intention
was
frustrated
by
our
appearance
just
above
after
crossing
the
serba
torrent
with
its
delicious
shade
of
fine
plane
trees
the
heat
of
the
atmosphere
with
the
radiation
from
rock
and
gravel
was
overpowering
i
found
the
mercury
at
in
my
shady
tent
aziz
khan
now
pays
me
a
visit
each
evening
to
give
me
such
information
as
is
attainable
regarding
the
people
and
locality
and
though
he
despised
me
at
first
after
moslem
fashion
we
are
now
very
good
friends
he
is
a
brave
man
and
made
no
attempt
to
magnify
the
danger
at
gorab
merely
saying
that
he
was
devoutly
thankful
that
we
had
escaped
with
our
lives
he
remonstrated
with
me
for
pitching
my
tent
in
such
a
lonely
place
quite
out
of
sight
of
the
other
camps
but
it
was
then
too
dark
to
move
it
he
said
that
there
was
some
risk
for
the
lurs
had
declared
they
would
rob
us
yet
but
he
should
watch
all
night
i
knew
he
would
for
the
sake
of
his
arab
mare
this
morning
soon
after
leaving
mowaz
the
sahib
guide
galloped
up
saying
that
his
master
had
been
robbed
of
everything
the
night
before
and
was
without
the
means
of
boiling
water
orders
were
given
for
the
camps
to
close
up
for
no
servants
to
ride
in
advance
of
or
behind
the
caravan
and
that
no
ilyats
should
hang
about
the
tents
although
the
bakhtiari
lurs
are
unified
under
one
chief
who
is
responsible
to
the
shah
for
the
security
of
the
country
and
though
there
has
been
a
great
improvement
since
sir
layard
time
the
advance
i
think
is
chiefly
external
the
instincts
and
traditions
of
the
tribes
remain
predatory
possibly
they
may
no
longer
attack
large
caravans
but
undoubtedly
they
rob
when
and
where
they
can
and
they
have
a
horrid
habit
of
stripping
their
victims
leaving
them
with
but
one
under
garment
if
they
do
not
kill
them
they
have
a
gesture
often
used
by
aziz
khan
in
his
descriptions
of
raids
which
means
stripping
a
man
to
his
shirt
the
word
used
is
skin
but
they
are
not
such
savages
as
this
implies
the
gesture
consists
in
putting
a
finger
into
the
mouth
slowly
withdrawing
it
and
holding
it
up
with
a
look
of
infinite
complacency
aziz
admits
with
some
pride
that
with
twenty
men
he
fell
upon
a
rich
caravan
near
shiraz
and
robbed
it
of
illustration

face
vol
march
has
been
mainly
through
very
attractive
scenery
we
crossed
the
proceeded
over
slopes
covered
with
wheat
and
flowers
and
along
a
rocky
path
overhanging
the
exquisitely
tinted
bazuft
forded
the
at
a
place
abounding
in
tamarisks
bearing
delicate
feathery
pink
blossoms
and
ascended
to
upland
lawns
of
great
beauty
on
which
the
oaks
come
down
both
in
clumps
and
singly
as
if
planted
the
views
from
this
natural
park
are
glorious
besides
the
great
ranges
with
which
i
have
become
familiar
the
or
white
mount
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
at
present
deserves
its
name
its
snows
descending
nearly
to
the
forests
which
clothe
its
lower
heights
a
deep
chasm
conceals
the
tabarak
stream
up
to
the
point
of
its
foamy
junction
with
the
bazuft
which
emerges
on
the
valley
by
an
abrupt
turn
through
a
very
fine
cañon
we
crossed
the
pure
green
waters
by
a
broad
ford
and
camped
on
the
right
bank
on
a
gravel
plateau
above
it
on
which
is
killa
bazuft
a
large
quadrangular
stone
fort
with
round
towers
at
the
corners
an
arcaded
front
a
vaulted
entrance
and
rooms
all
round
the
quadrangle
it
is
now
ruinous
some
irrigated
land
near
it
produces
rice
and
mosquitos
the
sahib
camp
is
pitched
here
he
has
been
badly
robbed
both
of
clothing
and
and
was
left
without
the
means
of
cooking
any
food
june
we
retraced
our
steps
as
far
as
the
source
of
the
duab
crossed
into
the
shamisiri
valley
and
by
a
low
pass
into
the
karun
valley
forded
the
karun
by
a
strong
deep
ford
crossed
a
low
range
into
the
zarin
valley
where
are
some
of
the
sources
of
the
zainderud
from
thence
marched
to
the
through
which
the
zainderud
there
a
vigorous
river
passes
into
the
chahar
mahals
went
up
the
kherson
valley
crossed
gargunak
and
by
a
very
steep
and
rugged
descent
reached
this
camp
a
place
of
springs
forming
the
upper
waters
of
the
zainderud
these
days
have
been
severe
the
heat
great
and
the
incidents
few
the
ascent
of
the
was
difficult
the
guide
misled
us
and
took
us
through
a
narrow
rift
in
the
crest
of
a
ridge
on
broken
ledges
of
rock
we
camped
at
a
height
of
feet
in
the
vicinity
of
snow
the
new
arrangement
which
is
necessary
for
safety
does
not
increase
comfort
for
the
arab
horses
noisy
quarrelsome
fellows
are
in
camp
and
the
mules
shake
their
bells
and
sneeze
and
bray
at
intervals
all
night
the
descent
of
feet
into
the
shamisiri
valley
over
bare
gravel
chiefly
was
a
very
hot
one
it
is
a
wide
open
valley
with
stony
hills
of
no
great
height
enclosing
it
with
much
green
sward
along
the
river
banks
above
which
running
to
a
great
height
on
the
hillsides
are
stretches
of
irrigated
wheat
so
far
as
i
have
yet
seen
the
wheat
is
all
bearded
it
is
a
most
smiling
valley
so
cultivated
indeed
and
so
trim
and
free
from
weeds
are
the
crops
that
one
naturally
looks
for
neat
and
barns
but
one
looks
in
vain
for
except
the
ruins
of
some
armenian
villages
there
are
no
traces
of
inhabitants
till
night
comes
when
the
glimmer
of
camp
fires
here
and
there
high
up
on
the
hillsides
shows
the
whereabouts
of
some
migratory
families
i
start
so
early
as
to
get
in
to
the
about
nine
now
and
the
caravan
two
hours
later
comes
in
with
mules
braying
bells
ringing
horses
squealing
for
a
fight
servants
shouting
then
the
mules
roll
the
are
hammered
down
and
in
the
blazing
afternoons
the
men
who
have
been
up
since
take
a
prolonged
siesta
and
a
solemn
hush
falls
on
the
camp
after
the
gorab
affair
i
loaded
my
revolver
and
now
sleep
with
it
under
my
pillow
carry
it
in
my
holster
and
never
have
it
out
of
my
reach
i
i
should
only
fire
it
in
the
air
if
i
were
attacked
but
the
fact
of
being
known
to
be
armed
with
such
a
weapon
is
more
likely
than
anything
else
to
prevent
attack
no
halt
is
now
made
on
the
march
the
sick
people
who
appeared
at
shamisiri
from
no
one
knows
where
were
difficult
and
suspicious
and
so
they
have
been
since
the
dialect
of
persian
has
somewhat
changed
and
aziz
khan
now
interprets
the
strange
accounts
of
maladies
to
mirza
and
he
interprets
to
me
when
they
crowd
almost
into
the
tent
aziz
when
appealed
to
pelts
them
with
stones
and
beats
them
with
a
stick
and
they
take
it
very
merrily
he
thinks
that
i
have
appliances
in
the
leather
box
for
the
cure
of
all
ills
and
when
he
brings
blind
people
and
i
say
that
i
can
not
do
anything
for
them
he
loses
his
temper
no
matter
where
we
camp
dark
handsome
men
spring
up
as
if
by
magic
and
hang
about
the
fires
for
the
rest
of
the
day
from
among
these
the
guides
are
usually
selected
numbers
of
patients
appear
everywhere
and
the
well
assemble
with
the
sick
round
my
tent
at
berigun
the
people
were
very
ignorant
and
obstinate
after
spending
a
whole
hour
on
two
men
and
making
medicines
up
for
them
they
said
they
would
have
the
ointment
but
nothing
that
goes
down
the
throat
another
said
and
he
had
several
disciples
that
he
would
not
take
the
medicine
for
fear
it
should
make
him
a
christian
one
man
who
has
fever
took
away
four
quinine
powders
yesterday
for
four
days
and
came
back
deaf
and
giddy
saying
that
i
have
killed
him
he
had
taken
them
all
at
once
it
is
very
pleasant
to
see
how
very
fond
the
men
are
of
their
children
and
how
tender
and
loving
they
are
to
their
little
girls
the
small
children
are
almost
always
pretty
but
by
three
years
old
the
grace
and
innocence
of
childhood
are
completely
lost
and
as
in
persia
there
are
no
child
faces
indeed
the
charm
of
childhood
scarcely
survives
the
if
they
are
sick
the
fathers
carry
them
for
miles
on
their
backs
for
medicine
and
handle
them
very
gently
and
take
infinite
pains
to
understand
about
the
medicine
and
diet
even
if
both
father
and
mother
come
with
a
child
the
man
always
carries
it
holds
it
is
the
spokesman
and
takes
the
directions
several
men
have
offered
me
mares
and
cows
if
i
will
cure
their
children
all
the
patients
ask
finally
what
must
i
eat
and
not
eat
the
bakhtiaris
have
often
asked
me
whether
it
is
unwholesome
to
live
so
much
as
they
do
on
cheese
and
sour
milk
they
attribute
much
of
their
dyspepsia
to
their
diet
they
live
principally
on
or
curdled
milk
buttermilk
cheese
or
clarified
butter
a
thin
leavened
cake
made
of
wheat
or
acorn
flour
bannocks
of
barley
meal
celery
pickled
in
sour
milk
occasionally
and
broth
flavoured
with
celery
stalks
and
garlic
frequently
they
never
use
fresh
milk
they
eat
all
fruits
whether
wild
or
cultivated
while
they
are
quite
unripe
almonds
are
eaten
green
they
hunt
the
ibex
and
shoot
the
francolin
and
the
bustard
and
make
soup
of
them
they
are
always
on
the
hills
after
game
and
spare
nothing
that
they
see
i
have
seen
them
several
times
firing
at
partridges
sitting
on
their
nests
they
use
eggs
considerably
boiling
them
hard
alcohol
in
any
form
is
unknown
among
them
and
few
except
the
khans
have
learned
the
delights
of
tea
and
coffee
buttermilk
pure
water
and
when
they
can
get
are
their
innocent
beverages
the
few
who
drink
tea
use
it
chiefly
to
colour
and
flavour
syrup
they
eat
twice
in
the
day
though
their
life
is
healthy
and
their
diet
simple
they
rarely
attain
old
age
a
man
of
sixty
is
accounted
very
old
indeed
the
men
are
certainly
not
polite
to
their
wives
and
if
they
get
in
their
way
or
mine
they
kick
them
aside
just
as
rough
men
kick
dogs

fording
the
karun
face
vol
we
have
been
marching
through
comparatively
lowland
scenery
like
the
chahar
mahals
from
which
we
are
not
far
at
shamisiri
except
for
the
fine
peak
of
dilleh
there
are
no
heights
to
arrest
the
eye
the
hills
on
the
north
side
are
low
gravelly
and
stony
with
perpendicular
outbreaks
of
rock
near
their
summits
to
the
south
they
are
of
a
different
formation
with
stratification
much
contorted
the
next
march
was
over
low
stony
hills
with
scanty
herbage
and
much
gum
tragacanth
camel
thorn
and
the
down
a
steep
descent
into
the
karun
valley
where
low
green
cultivated
levels
and
cultivation
carried
to
a
great
altitude
on
the
hillsides
refresh
the
tired
eyes
the
karun
liberated
for
a
space
from
its
imprisonment
in
the
mountains
divides
into
several
streams
each
one
a
forcible
river
winds
sinuously
among
the
grass
gleams
like
a
mirror
and
by
its
joyous
rapid
career
gives
animation
to
what
even
without
it
would
be
at
this
season
a
very
smiling
landscape
crossing
the
first
ford
in
advance
of
the
guide
we
got
into
very
deep
water
and
was
carried
off
his
feet
but
scrambled
bravely
to
a
shingle
bank
where
we
waited
for
a
native
who
took
us
by
long
and
devious
courses
to
the
left
bank
the
current
is
strong
and
deep
and
the
crossing
of
the
caravan
was
a
very
pretty
sight
we
halted
for
sunday
at
berigun
an
eminence
on
which
are
a
ruinous
fort
a
graveyard
with
several
lions
rampant
and
a
grove
of
very
fine
white
poplars
one
of
them
eighteen
feet
in
circumference
six
feet
from
the
ground
a
sea
of
wheat
in

the
karun
in
a
deep
channel
in
the
green
plateau
some
and
opposite
in
the
the
great
rocky
precipitous
mass
of
the
zard
kuh
range
with
its
wild
crests
and
great
made
up
a
pleasant
landscape
the
heat
at
this
altitude
of
feet
and
in
the
shade
was
not
excessive
the
next
day
march
was
short
and
uninteresting
partly
up
the
karun
valley
and
partly
over
gravelly
hills
with
very
scanty
herbage
and
no
camps
from
which
we
came
down
abruptly
into
the
elevated
plain
of
cheshmeh
zarin
the
golden
fountain
at
a
height
of
feet
the
plain
being
about
five
miles
by
two
and
a
half
receding
hills
with
some
herbage
upon
them
border
the
plateau
and
the
zard
kuh
though
at
some
distance
apparently
blocks
up
the
western
end
a
powerful
spring
bursts
from
under
a
ridge
of
rock
down
the
plain
and
becomes
at
once
a
clear
gentle
stream
fifty
feet
broad
which
passes
through
the
level
green
sward
in
a
series
of
turns
which
are
quite
marvellous
smooth

feeding
large

led
to
and
fro
others
being
watered
laden
asses
arriving
and
departing
butter
being
churned
and
carpets
being
woven
form
a
scene
of
quiet
but
busy
industry
which
makes
one
feel
quite
in
the
world
this
stream
is
one
of
the
chief
sources
of
the
zainderud
from
this
cheerful
we
marched
over
low
hills
forded
the
zainderud
several
times
and
came
upon
several
ilyat
camps
on
low
rich
pasture
lands
these
nomads
had
no
tents
but
dwelt
in
booths
without
fronts
the
roofs
and
backs
being
made
of
the
tough
yellow
flowering
stalks
of
the
celery
the
path
follows
the
left
bank
of
the
river
there
a
full
broad
stream
flowing
through
the
through
rounded
hills
and
scenery
much
like
that
of
the
cheviots
at
the
we
camped
and
this
morning
crossed
a
low
hill
into
a
valley
watered
by
the
kherson
ascended
a
shoulder
of
gargunak
and
halted
at
aziz
khan
tents
where
the
women
were
very
hospitable
bringing
out
cows
milk
and
allowing
themselves
to
be
photographed
an
unpleasant
occurred
to
me
while
we
were
marching
through
some
very
lonely
hills
if
mirza
rides
as
he
should
behind
me
his
mule
always
falls
out
of
sight
and
he
is
useless
so
lately
i
have
put
him
in
front
i
dropped
a
glove
and
after
calling
and
whistling
to
him
vainly
got
off
and
picked
it
up
for
i
am
reduced
to
one
pair
but
attempt
after
attempt
to
get
on
again
failed
for
each
time
as
i
put
my
hand
on
the
saddle
nimbly
ran
backwards
and
in
spite
of
my
bad
knee
i
had
to
lead
him
for
an
hour
before
i
was
missed
running
a
great
risk
of
being
robbed
by
passing
lurs
when
mirza
did
come
back
he
left
his
mule
in
a
ravine
exposed
to
robbers
and
aziz
khan
was
so
infuriated
that
he
threatened
to
cut
his
throat
aziz
despises
him
as
a
man
for
his
want
of
and
mimics
the
dreamy
helpless
fashion
in
which
he
sits
on
his
mule
but
mirza
can
never
be
provoked
into
any
display
of
temper
or
discourtesy
from
aziz
camp
we
had
a
very
steep
and
rugged
descent
to
this
place
cheshmeh
dima
where
we
have
halted
for
two
days
three
streams
the
of
the
zainderud
have
their
sources
in
this
neighbourhood
and
one
of
them
the
dima
rises
as
a
powerful
spring
under
a
rock
here
collects
in
a
basin
and
then
flows
away
as
a
river
the
basin
or
pool
has
on
one
side
a
rocky
hill
with
the
ruins
of
a
fort
upon
it
and
on
the
three
others
low
stone
walls
of
very
rude
construction
the
lurs
who
soon
came
about
us
say
that
the
ruined
fort
was
the
pleasure
palace
of
a
great
king
who
coined
money
here
the
sides
of
the
valley
are
dotted
with
camps
opposite
are
the
large
camp
and
white
tent
of
chiragh
ali
khan
a
chief
who
has
the
reputation
of
being
specially
friendly
in
his
views
of
england
the
heat
yesterday
was
overpowering
and
the
crowds
of
bakhtiari
visitors
and
of
sick
people
could
hardly
be
received
with

descended
into

called

an
artificial

winding
among

he
fancied

at

hours
he
was
not

exaggerated
the

by
filling

gave

the

its

its

remarkably

come
up
from

on

the

is
soft
in

by
a
very
difficult
track
on
the
rocky

looked
the
most
magnificent
and
stupendous
pass
i
had
ever
seen
always
excepting
the
entrance
to
the
lachalang
pass
in
lesser
tibet
and
an
atmospheric
illusion
raised
the
mountains
which
guard
it
up
to
the
blue
sky
i
much
wished
to
reach
the
summit
but
in
a
very
narrow
chasm
was
fairly
baffled
by
a
wide
rift
in
a
sort
of
elevated
which
the
mule
could
not
cross
and
camped
there
for
some
hours
but
even
there
nomads
crowded
round
my
tent
with
more
audacity
in
their
curiosity
than
they
usually
show
and
mirza
heard
two
of
them
planning
an
ingenious
robbery
the
heat
was
very
great
when
i
returned
in
the
shade
but
rest
was
impossible
for
numbers
of
mares
and
horses
were
tethered
near
my
tent
and
their
riders
men
and
women
to
the
number
of
forty
seized
on
me
clamouring
for
medicines
and
eye
lotions

often
wonder
at
the
quiet
gravity
of
mirza
face
as
he
interprets
their
grotesque
accounts
of
their
ailments
a
son
of
chiragh
ali
khan
came
to
tell
me
that
the
feringhi
ointment
had
cured
a
beautiful
young
woman
of
his
tribe
of
an
abscess
in
her
nose
an
instance
of
real
benefit
hardly
consoles
for
many
failures
and
any
cure
increases
the
exhausting
number
of
patients
on
one
day
on
that
plain
there
was
no
rest
between
eleven
and
five
small
events
occurred
tending
to
show
that
the
good
order
which
the
ilkhani
government
secures
is
chiefly
round
the
centre
of
rule
stories
of
tribal
disputes
with
violence
and
of
fights
arising
out
of
blood
feuds
came
in
daily
and
recent
sword
cuts
and
bullet
wounds
were
brought
to
the
one
day
there
was
a
disturbance
in
camp
owing
to
a
man
attacking
hassan
for
preventing
a
woman
from
entering
my
tent
in
my
absence
i
learned
very
soon
after
coming
into
this
country
that
the
bakhtiaris
are
dangerously
sensitive
about
their
women
although
the
latter
are
unveiled
and
have
an
amount
of
latitude
unusual
in
the
east
i
have
more
than
once
cautioned
my
servants
on
this
point
for
any
supposed
insult
to
a
female
relative
of
a
bakhtiari
would
have
by
custom
to
be
wiped
out
in
blood
this
extreme
sensitiveness
has
its
good
side
for
even
in
the
midst
of
the
tribal
wars
and
broils
which
are
constantly
occurring
female
honour
is
always
secure
and
a
woman
can
travel
safely
alone
through
the
wildest
regions
a
woman
betraying
her
husband
would
however
almost
certainly
be
put
to
death

night

of

kings

his
anxiety
to
deliver

once
for
all
from
the
risk
of
famine
formed
and
partly
executed
the
design
of
turning
to
account
the
difference
in
level
about
feet
between
the
karun
and
zainderud
and
by
cleaving
an
intervening
mountain
spur
to
let
the
waters
of
the
one
pass
into
the
other
the
work
of
cleaving
was
carried
on
by
his
successors
but
either
the
workmen
failed
to
get
through
the
flint
which
underlies
the
or
the
downfall
of
the
sufari
dynasty
made
an
end
of
it

nothing
remains
of

should
have
been

famous

enterprise

a
huge
cleft
with
tool
marks
upon
it
in
the
crest
of
the
hill
in
length
yards
in
breadth
fifteen
and
fifty
feet
deep
above
it
are
great
heaps
of
quarried
stones
and
the
remains
of
houses
possibly
of
overseers
and
below
are
the
remnants
of
the
dam
which
was
to
have
diverted
the
karun
water
into
the
cleft
on
a
cool
beautiful
evening
i
came
down
from
this
somewhat
mournful
height
to
a
very
striking
scene
where
the
branch
from
the
unites
with
the
stream
from
the
dark
high
sides
of
their
channels
shutting
out
the
mountains
both
rivers
rush
tumultuously
above
their
union
but
afterwards
glide
downwards
in
a
smooth
silent
volume
of
most
exquisite
colour
so
deep
as
to
be
unfordable
and
fringed
with
green
strips
of
grass
and
innumerable
flowers
on
emerging
from
the
ravine
the
noble
mass
of
the
zard
kuh
was
seen
in
the
sunset
its
crests
and
spires
of
snow
cleaving
the
blue
sky
and
the
bright
waters
and
grass
of
the
plain
gave
a
smiling
welcome
home
the
next
march
was
a
very
beautiful
one
most
of
the
way
over
the
spurs
and
ravines
of
the
grand
by
sheep
and
goat
tracks
and
no
tracks
at
all
a
lonely
and
magnificent
ride
shut
in
among
mountains
of
great
height
their
spurs
green
with
tamarisk
salvias
and
euphorbias
their
ravines
noisy
with
torrents
bright
springs
bursting
from
their
sides
with
grass
below
and
their
slopes
patched
with
acres
of
deep
snow
on
whose
margin
purple
crocuses
yellow
ranunculuses
and
white
tulips
were
springing
but
the
grand
feature
of
the
march
is
not
the
mighty
on
the
right
but
the
magnificent
zard
kuh
on
the
left
uplifting
its
and
into
the
blue
of
heaven
on
the
other
side
of
an
valley
at
the
pass
of
feet
in
altitude
where
we
have
halted
for
two
days
the
zard
kuh
approaches
the
so
closely
as
to
leave
only
a
very
deeply
cleft
ravine
between
them
from
this
pass
there
is
a
very
grand
view
not
only
of
these
ranges
but
of
a
tremendous
depression
into
which
the
pass
leads
beyond
which
is
the
fine
definite
mountain
this
pass
is
the
watershed
between
the
karun
and
though
be
it
remembered
the
latter
eventually
unites
with
the
former
at
all
is
treeless
the
is
the
only
real
mountain
seen
on
the
journey
hitherto
it
is
unlike
all
others
not
only
in
its
huge
bulk
and
gigantic
and
spurs
but
in
being
its
name
means
the
variegated
mountain
it
has
much
devonshire
red
about
it
but
clad
as
it
is
now
with
greenery
its
soil
and
rock
ribs
can
not
be
investigated
it
is
a
mountain
rich
in
waters
both
streams
and
springs
it
is
physically
and
geographically
a
centre
a
sort
of
knot
nearly
uniting
what
have
been
happily
termed
the
outer
and
inner
ranges
of
the
bakhtiari
mountains
and
it
manifestly
divides
the
country
into
two
regions
which
for
convenience
sake
have
been
felicitously
termed
the
bakhtiari
country
and
upper
elam
the
former
lying
to
the
and
the
latter
to
the
of
this
most
important
group
of
peaks
only
just
under
feet
which
passes
under
the
general
name
a
prominent
geographical
feature
of
this
region
is
that
from
this
point
the
valleys
rim
parallel
with
the
great
ranges
and
are
tolerably
wide
and
level
carrying
the
drainage
easily
and
smoothly
with
plenty
of
room
for
the
fairly
easy
tracks
which
usually
run
on
both
banks
of
the
rivers
the
reader
who
has
followed
the
geographical
part
of
my
narrative
will
i
hope
have
perceived
that
the
openings
through
the
outer
and
inner
ranges
in
the
region
previously
traversed
are
few
and
remarkable
the
and
the
warkash
piercing
the
outer
and
the
the
inner
range
the
is
the
definite
and
the
originating
cause
of
two
drainage
systems
and
it
may
be
seen
from
the
map
as
was
beautifully
obvious
from
the
summit
of
one
of
the
peaks
over
feet
in
height
that
it
marks
a
singular
change
in
the
lie
of
the
land
inasmuch
as
the
main
drainage
no
longer
runs
parallel
to
the
main
ranges
but
cuts
them
across
breaking
up
upper
elam
into
a
wild
and
confused
sea
of
mountains
riven
and
gashed
without
any
attempt
at
uniformity
this
cutting
through
the
ranges
at
right
angles
by
rivers
which
somehow
must
reach
the
sea
probably
through
channels
formed
by
some
tremendous
operations
of
nature
presents
serious
obstacles
to
the
traveller
and
must
effectually
prevent
commerce
flowing
in
that
direction
the
aspect
of
upper
elam
as
seen
from
the
is
of
huge
walls
of
naked
rock
occasionally
opening
out
so
as
to
give
space
for
such
a
noble
mountain
as
the
with
tremendous
gorges
or
cañons
among
them
with
sheer
precipices
and
feet
high
below
which
torrents
crystalline
in
their
purity
rage
and
boom
thundering
on
their
way
to
join
the
the
valleys
are
short
and
elevated
from
to
feet
and
the
tracks
dignified
by
the
name
of
roads
pass
along
them
and
at
great
altitudes
on
the
sides
of
the
main
ranges
but
are
compelled
continually
to
make
dips
and
ascents
of
many
thousand
feet
to
reach
and
emerge
from
the
fords
of
the
rivers
which
dash
through
the
magnificent
rifts
and
cañons
to
the
of
the
the
formation
is
orderly
and
intelligible
to
the
all
is
confusion
and
disorder
but
a
sublime
confusion
two
great
passes
to
the
north
and
south
of
this
magnificent
mountain
are
the
only
ways
of
communication
between
the
region
of
upper
elam
and
the
bakhtiari
country
the
northern
pass
was
ascended
from
dima
the
kharba
one
of
the
of
the
zainderud
rises
on
it
and
fertilises
a
beautiful
valley
about
fourteen
miles
in
length
that
pass
the
the
pass
of
jamal
stone
the
stone
being
a
great
detached
rock
near
the
summit
and
the
the
cattle
pass
on
the
southern
side
are
both
over
feet
in
altitude
they
are
seldom
traversed
by
the
natives
and
only
in
parties
as
both
are
very
dangerous
the
must
now
be
regarded
as
the
true
birthplace
of
the
zainderud
and
the
karun
though
their
sources
have
hitherto
been
placed
in
the
zard
kuh
a
tributary
of
the
and
locally
considered
as
its
rises

the

aziz
khan
aziz
khan
who
had
gone
to
his
tents
has
returned
with
a
very
nice
young
servant
and
another
mare
and
with
him
noise
and
go
he
has
such
a
definite
personality
and
is
so
energetic
in
his
movements
that
the
camps
are
dull
without
him
he
is
a
fearful
beggar
he
asks
me
for
something
every
day
and
for
things
he
can
make
no
possible
use
of
simply
out
of
acquisitiveness
he
has
got
from
me
among
many
other
things
a
new
embroidered
a
knife
an
indian
many
yards
of
silk
a
large
pair
of
scissors
bracelets
for
his
wife
and
daughter
and
working
materials
and
now
he
has
set
his
heart
on
a
large
combination
knife
which
is
invaluable
to
me
what
use
is
that
knife
to
a
woman
he
asks
daily
now
he
says
that
i
have
given
him
many
things
but
i
have
never
given
him
money
and
he
must
have
a
purse
of
money
why
can
you
do
so
much
more
than
our
women
he
often
asks
his
astonishment
that
i
can
read
and
yet
more
that
i
can
write
is
most
amusing
can
many
women
in
your
country
write
he
asked
can
your
queen
read
and
write
can
she
embroider
as
you
do
at
first
he
thought
that
i
only
pretended
to
write
but
was
convinced
when
i
sent
a
letter
to
the
ilkhani
he
usually
appears
when
a
number
of
sick
people
come
interprets
their
dialect
into
good
persian
for
mirza
and
beats
and
pelts
them
with
stones
when
they
crowd
too
closely
but
they
do
not
care
sometimes
when
i
say
that
nothing
that
i
have
can
do
a
sick
person
any
good
he
begs
for
my
sake
that
i
will
try
and
when
i
still
decline
he
goes
away
in
a
tantrum
cursing
and
shaking
his
wide
with
an
angry
strut
but
is
soon
back
again
with
fresh
demands
he
spreads
his
and
goes
through
his
devotions
thrice
a
day
but
somehow
aziz
khan
praying
seems
to
suggest
some
ludicrous
idea
even
to
his
feringhis
do
fear
god
he
said
to
me
they
never
worship
i
told
him
he
was
wrong
that
many
are
very
devout
he
said
does
pray
mentioning
a
european
i
said
most
certainly
and
he
walked
away
with
the
sneering
laugh
of
a
fiend
he
is
a
complete
child
of
nature
he
says
what
he
thinks
and
acts
chiefly
as
he
pleases
but
withal
there
is
a
gentlemanliness
and
a
considerable
dignity
about
him
i
think
that
his
ruling
religion
is
loyalty
to
isfandyar
khan
and
consequent
hatred
of
the
ilkhani
and
all
his
other
enemies
going
through
a
pantomimic
firing
of
an
english
rifle
he
said
i
hope
i
may
shoot
the
shah
with
this
one
day
for
what
reason
i
asked
because
he
murdered
isfandyar
khan
father
and
i
hate
him
i
asked
him
if
he
liked
shooting
and
he
replied
i
like
shooting
men
he
has
done
a
good
deal
of
fighting
and
has
been
shot
through
the
lung
arm
and
leg
besides
getting
sword
cuts
and
he
takes
some
pride
in
showing
his
wounds
i
think
he
is
faithful
mirza
says
that
he
has
smoothed
many
difficulties
and
has
put
many
crooked
things
straight
without
taking
any
credit
to
himself
his
most
apparent
faults
are
greed
and
a
sort
of
selfish
cunning
there
are
many
camps
about
the
and
crowds
needing
very
careful
watching
are
always
about
the
tents
wanting
to
see
feringhi
things
most
of
the
people
never
having
seen
a
feringhi
it
is
a
novel
sight
in
the
evenings
when
long
lines
of
brown
sheep
in
single
file
cross
the
following
the
shepherds
into
camp
this
on
the
marks
a
new
departure
on
the
journey
as
well
as
the
establishment
of
certain
geographical
facts
it
will
be
impossible
for
the
future
to
place
the
source
of
the
karun
in
the
zard
kuh
range
for
we
followed
the
stream
up
to
the
or
to
indulge
in
the
supposition
that
the
mountains
which
lie
to
the
are
covered
with
eternal
snow
which
in
this
latitude
would
imply
heights
from
to
feet
it
is
indeed
a
disappointment
that
look
where
one
may
over
the
great
area
filled
up
by
huge
rock
barriers
and
vast
mountains
from
the
softer
ridges
bounding
the
fiery
persian
plains
to
the
last
hills
in
which
the
inner
range
descends
upon
the
great
alluvial
levels
of
khuzistan
not
a
peak
presents
itself
in
the
glittering
snowy
mantle
which
i
have
longed
to
see
snow
in
forlorn
patches
or
nearly
hidden
in
sunless
rifts
and
the
of
the
zard
kuh
will
remain
for
a
time
but
eternal
snow
is
nowhere
and
it
does
not
appear
that
the
highest
of
the
peaks
much
exceeds
feet
either
in
upper
elam
or
the
bakhtiari
country
great
difficulties
are
ahead
not
only
from
tracks
which
are
said
to
be
impassable
for
laden
animals
but
from
the
disturbed
state
of
the
country
from
what
i
hear
from
aziz
khan
and
from
the
guides
who
have
come
up
here
i
gather
that
the
power
of
the
ilkhani
shaky
enough
even
nearer
ardal
all
but
dwindles
away
here
and
is
limited
to
the
collection
of
the
tribute
the
petty
khans
fighting
among
themselves
and
doing
mainly
what
is
right
in
their
own
eyes
it
is
somewhat
of
a
satisfaction
to
me
that
it
is
impossible
now
to
go
back
and
that
a
region
absolutely
unexplored
lies
ahead
doubtless
full
as
the
previously
untraversed
regions
have
been
of
surprises
and
interests

that
the

found
it
equally

hope
that
the
general
reader
will
excuse
the
medical
and
surgical
notes
given
in
these

i
am
anxious
to
show
the
great
desire
for
european
medical
aid

the
wide
sphere
that
is

a
descent
of
feet
brought
us
into
the
grand
and
narrow
gorge
of
the
sahid
stream
with
willow
walnut
oak
maple
pear
and
crab
along
its
banks
knotted
together
by
sprays
of
pink
roses
with
oaks
higher
up
and
above
them
again
overhanging
mountains
of
naked
rock
scorched
and
radiating
heat
quite
suddenly
after
a
steep
ascent
there
is
a
view
of
a
steep
slope
below
where
a
lateral
ravine
comes
down
on
the
sahid
green
with
crops
of
wheat
and
barley
poplars
willows
and
a
grove
of
fine
walnuts
and
more
wonderful
still
with
an
in
good
repair
and
a
village
also
named
sahid
in
which
people
live
all
the
year
the
glen
is
magnificent
and
is
the
one
spot
that
i
have
seen
in
persia
which
suggests
switzerland
it
is
a
steep
and
difficult
descent
through
a
walnut
grove
to
the
village
and
before
i
knew
it
i
was
on
the
roof
of
a
house
the
village
is
built
in
ten
steps
up
the
steep
hillside
the
posts
which
support
one
projecting
roof
resting
on
the
back
of
the
roof
below
the
people
were
timid
and
suspicious
gave
untrue
replies
to
questions
at
first
said
we
were
doing
talisman
to
take
their
country
and
consulted
in
aziz
and
mirza
hearing
how
they
might
rob
us
it
was
even
difficult
to
get
them
to
bring
fodder
for
the
horses
they
were
fanatical
and
called
us
some
of
the
women
have
never
been
out
of
their
romantic
hole
in
which
they
are
shut
up
by
snow
for
four
months
every
winter
ten
families
live
there
each
one
possessing
a
step
they
said
they
owned
goats
and
sheep
five
cows
and
seven
asses
that
they
sell
their
wheat
and
salt
from
a
salt
spring
at
the
back
of
the
hill
and
that
their
food
is
chiefly
acorn
flour
made
into
bread
curds
and
wild
celery
this
bread
is
made
from
the
fruit
of
the
which
is
often
nearly
three
inches
long
the
acorns
are
not
gathered
but
picked
up
when
they
fall
the
women
bruise
them
between
stones
to
expel
the
bitter
juices
they
are
afterwards
reduced
to
flour
which
is
well
washed
to
remove
the
remaining
bitterness
and
dried
in
the
sun
it
is
either
made
into
thin
cakes
and
baked
or
is
mixed
into
a
paste
with
buttermilk
and
water
and
eaten
raw
the
baked
cakes
are
not
very
unpalatable
but
the
paste
is
nauseous
acorn
flour
is
never
used
from
choice
the
grain
is
exchanged
for
blue
cottons
and
tobacco
it
is
not
possible
to
imagine
a
more
isolated
life
tihran
and
isfahan
are
names
barely
known
to
these
people
and
the
shah
is
little
more
to
them
than
the
czar
near
the
of
sahid
is
a
rendered
holy
by
the
dust
of
a
or
saint
who
lies
there
it
has
many
headstones
and
one
very
large
gray
stone
lion
on
whose
sides
are
rude
carvings
of
a
gun
a
sword
a
dagger
a
and
a
spear
on
a
few
low
headstones
a
peculiar
comb
is
carved
denoting
that
the
grave
is
that
of
a
woman
to
several
stones
long
locks
of
hair
are
attached
some
black
and
shining
others
and
discoloured
it
is
customary
for
the
bakhtiari
women
to
sacrifice
their
locks
to
the
memory
of
their
husbands
and
other
near
male
relatives
i
think
that
they
have
a
great
deal
of
conjugal
and
family
affection
though
their
ways
are
rough
and
that
they
mourn
for
their
dead
for
a
considerable
time
on
one
grave
a
young
woman
was
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
wailing
with
a
sound
like
the
highland
coronach
but
longer
and
more
despairing
she
was
also
beating
her
uncovered
bosom
rhythmically
and
had
cut
her
face
till
the
blood
came
so
apparently
absorbed
was
she
in
her
grief
that
she
took
no
notice
of
a
feringhi
and
an
indian
she
had
been
bereaved
of
her
husband
for
a
year
his
life
having
been
sacrificed
in
a
tribal
fight
the
next
two
days
were
occupied
in
what
might
well
be
called
mountaineering
on
goat
tracks
skirting
great
mountain
spurs
on
shelving
paths
not
always
wide
enough
for
a
horse
two
feet
alongside
of
each
other
with
precipitous
declivities
of
or
feet
ascending
on
ledges
of
rock
to
over
feet
then
by
frightful
tracks
descending
or
but
to
climb
again
and
at
every
descent
always
seeing
in
front
dizzy
zigzags
surmounting
the
crest
of
some
ragged
ridge
only
as
one
knows
to
descend
again
nearly
fell
over
backwards
with
me
once
and
again
and
came
down
a
smooth
face
of
rock
as
mules
sometimes
come
down
a
snow
slide
in
switzerland
i
was
told
that
i
should
break
my
neck
many
times
that
no
bakhtiari
had
ever
ridden
over
these
tracks
or
ever
would
but
my
hurt
knee
left
me
no
choice
these
tracks
are
simply
worn
by
the
annual
passage
of
the
nomads
and
their
flocks
they
are
frightful
beyond
all
description
the
worst
paths
in
ladak
and
nubra
are
nothing
to
them
occasionally
we
traversed
deep
ravines
with
noisy
torrents
where
the
shade
was
dense
and
willows
ash
walnut
cherry
elm
plum
and
oak
were
crowded
together
with
the
in
rifts
above
with
a
moist
climate
it
would
be
a
glorious
land
but
even
where
the
scenery
is
finest
there
is
always
something
lacking
there
is
no
atmosphere
all
is
sharp
colourless
naked
even
many
of
the
flowers
are
queer
and
some
are
positively
ugly
many
have
thorns
some
are
others
woolly
a
few
sticky
inconspicuous
flowers
and
large
leathery
leaves
are
very
common
the
of
some
are
far
prettier
than
the
flowers
and
brighter
in
colour
in
several
the
calyx
grows
after
the
corolla
has
withered
and
becomes
bright
pink
or
orange
like
a
very
gay
but
only
blossom
predominate
this
month
too
are
numerous
all
even
bulbs
send
down
their
roots
very
deep
after
leaving
camp
yesterday
and
crossing
a
high
pass
we
descended
into
the
earth
interior
only
to
ascend
a
second
pass
by
a
steep
zigzag
suddenly
a
wall
of
rock
appeared
as
if
to
bar
progress
but
on
nearing
it
a
narrow
slit
was
seen
to
afford
a
risky
passage
offering
no
other
foothold
than
smooth
shelving
rock
on
the
inside
for
a
number
of
yards
with
a
precipice
above
on
the
right
and
below
on
the
left
ledges
of
slippery
rock
led
up
to
it
and
was
jumping
and
scrambling
up
these
when
the
guides
howled
to
me
to
stop
and
i
was
lifted
off
somehow
the
white
arab
was
rolling
and
struggling
in
the
v
following
lost
his
footing
and
the
two
presented
a
confusion
of
hoofs
and
legs
in
the
air
and
bodies
struggling
and
rolling
through
the
slit
till
they
picked
themselves
up
with
cut
legs
the
guides
tried
vainly
to
find
some
way
by
which
the
caravans
which
followed
much
later
might
avoid
this
risk
and
the
agha
went
down
the
pass
which
had
been
so
laboriously
ascended
to
give
directions
for
its
passage
the
on
reaching
the
difficulty
made
attempts
to
turn
it
but
failed
some
loads
were
taken
off
and
carried
by
men
and
each
mule
struggled
safely
through
with
one
man
at
his
head
and
one
or
two
supporting
him
by
his
tail
the
passage
of
the
v
took
the
caravan
an
hour
but
meantime
there
was
the
enjoyment
of
the
sight
of
a
confused
mass
of
mountains
whitish
precipitous
ranges
with
tremendous
ravines
between
them
lying
in
the
cool
blue
shadows
of
early
morning
mountains
with
long
straight
summits
mountains
and
great
spires
of
naked
rock
huge
ranges
buttressed
by
huge
spurs
with
outcrops
of
barren
rock
a
mighty
solitary
impressive
scene
an
uplifted
wilderness
without
a
camp
the
descent
of
feet
from
this
summit
consists
of
any
number
of
zigzag
tracks
on
the
narrow
top
of
the
narrow
ridge
of
one
of
the
huge
rocky
buttresses
of
gartak
both
sides
being
precipitous
even
on
the
horse
i
was
dizzy
and
he
went
down
most
unwillingly
not
taking
any
responsibility
as
to
finding
the
safest
way
and
depending
solely
on
my
eye
and
hand
mirza
being
hampered
with
the
care
of
his
own
mule
was
useless
and
otherwise
i
was
alone
these
thready
zigzags
ended
on
what
appeared
to
be
a
precipice
from
the
foot
of
which
human
voices
came
up
shouting
to
me
to
dismount
i
did
so
and
got
down
hanging
on
to
bridle
and
letting
myself
down
over
the
ledges
by
my
hands
for
another
hour
having
to
be
careful
all
the
time
to
avoid
being
knocked
down
by
his
slips
and
jumps
i
could
hardly
get
him
to
face
some
of
the
smooth
broken
faces
of
rock
a
slide
of
gravel
a
worn
thin
over
a
torrent
and
some
slippery
rock
ledges
to
scramble
over
by
its
side
led
to
a
pathless
ascent
through
grass
and
bushes
the
guides
and
aziz
roared
to
me
from
a
valley
below
by
which
roars
i
found
my
way
down
a
steep
hillside
to
the
gokun
a
mountain
river
of
a
unique
and
most
beautiful
colour
abounding
in
deep
pools
from
which
it
emerges
in
billows
of
cool
foam
i
forded
it
by
a
broad
ford
where
water
glides
calmly
over
brown
and
red
pebbles
with
a
margin
and
as
i
crossed
a
flock
of
goats
swam
and
jumped
from
rock
to
rock
from
the
other
side
the
whole
scene
an
artist
dream
this
valley
has
magnificent
pasturage
hay
not
yet
sun
cured
long
grass
and
abundant
clover
and
vetches
brightened
by
a
profuse
growth
of
a
small
the
march
over
the
gokun
pass
and
down
to
the
gokun
river
is
the
worst
i
ever
made
had
the
track
been
in
ladak
or
lahoul
it
would
have
been
marked
on
the
government
maps
impassable
for
laden
animals
yet
hadji
splendid
mules
held
at
times
by
both
head
and
tail
accomplished
it
and
only
minor
disasters
occurred
one
mule
had
his
head
gashed
mirza
had
a
bad
fall
and
broke
my
milk
bottle
hassan
leading
his
own
horse
fell
twenty
feet
with
the
animal
and
cut
his
arm
the
ridge
pole
of
my
tent
was
broken
and
is
with
difficulty
bandaged
so
as
to
hold
and
some
of
the
other
baggage
was
damaged
hadji
grumbles
politely
and
says
that
in
all
time
loaded
mules
were
never
taken
over
such
tracks
and
i
believe
him
aziz
says
that
i
must
be
tired
of
life
or
i
should
never
ride
over
them
and
certainly
carried
me
at
the
peril
of
his
life
and
mine
the
camps
are
pitched
for
sunday
at
an
altitude
of
feet
high
above
the
river
mine
under
the
befriending
shade
of
a
colossal
natural
sphinx
so
remarkable
that
two
photographs
and
a
sketch
by
mirza
were
taken
of
it
it
confronted
us
in
a
startling
way
a
grand
man
head
with
a
flowing
wig
and
a
legal
face
much
resembling
the
photographs
of
lord
chancellor
hatherley
the
mules
have
been
poorly
fed
for
the
last
few
days
and
it
is
pleasant
to
see
them
revelling
in
the
abundant
pasturage
after
this
tremendous
nine
hours
march
they
came
in
quite
cheerily
cock
o
the
walk
leading
the
caravan
with
his
fighting
face
on
shaking
his
grand
mane
and
stamping
as
if
he
had
not
walked
a
mile
the
sunday
has
been
a
very
quiet
one
except
for
the
fighting
of
the
horses
which
seem
intent
on
murdering
each
other
the
fussiness
of
aziz
about
a
cut
which
his
mare
got
yesterday
and
for
which
he
expects
my
frequent
attention
and
the
torment
of
the
which
revel
in
the
heat
which
kills
the
mosquitos
july
on
monday
it
was
a
pretty
march
from
the
shadow
of
the
sphinx
through
a
and
cultivated
valley
with
many
camps
and
by
a
high
pass
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
on
which
i
rested
for
some
hours
at
a
height
of
feet
the
actual
summit
being
somewhat
higher
on
its
side
the
view
was
hideous
of
scorched
rolling
gravel
hills
and
wide
scorched
valleys
with
two
winding
streams
and
some
patches
of
wheat
surrounding
two
scorched
mud
villages
the
descent
to
camp
kamarun
a
deep
ravine
with
a
rapid
mountain
stream
was
blessed
by
a
shower
which
cooled
the
air
and
resulted
in
the
only
grand
stormy
wild
sunset
that
i
have
seen
for
months
this
valley
is
blocked
at
the
east
end
by
gargunaki
on
the
west
by
the
kala
kuh
and
the
rocky
ranges
of
faidun
and
the
close
in
its
sides
long
long
ago
tradition
says
a
certain
great
chief
had
eleven
sons
they
quarrelled
and
divided
into
hostile
factions
of
four
and
seven
forming
the
still
hostile
groups
of
the
chahar
lang
and
the
haft
lang
of
for
some
time
past
the
ruling
dynasty
has
been
of
the
haft
lang
division
aziz
also
belongs
to
it
and
we
have
been
almost
entirely
among
its
tribes
hitherto
this
ancient
feud
though
modified
in
intensity
still
exists
at
this
camp
we
were
among
tribes
of
the
chahar
lang
and
there
was
reason
to
apprehend
robbery
and
a
night
attack
so
careful
arrangements
were
made
and
the
men
kept
guard
by
turns
the
following
day
march
which
was
also
pretty
included
a
long
descent
through
a
cultivated
valley
with
willows
plums
and
walnuts
growing
along
a
stream
and
a
steep
ascent
and
descent
to
the
two
villages
of
masir
on
slopes
belonging
to
taimur
khan
the
chief
of
the
powerful
magawe
tribe
to
whom
the
villagers
pay
what
they
call
a
moderate
rent
in
sheep
goats
and
grain
they
are
of
the
chahar
lang
and
deny
that
they
are
under
the
ilkhani
rule
they
had
a
fight
with
a
tribe
of
the
haft
lang
ten
days
ago
killed
twelve
men
had
seven
killed
and
wounded
and
took
some
guns
and
horses
these
however
they
have
restored
at
the
command
of
the
ilkhani
which
contradicts
their
assertion
they
have
a
with
several
very
white
lions
rampant
upon
it
of
most
noble
aspect
boldly
carved
and
with
the
usual
on
their
sides
the
camps
were
on
a
gravelly
slope
with
a
yellow
glare
and
the
mercury
reached
the
presence
of
villages
in
this
country
always
indicates
a
comparatively
warm
climate
in
which
people
can
live
throughout
the
winter
the
scripture
phrase
maketh
the
outgoings
of
the
morning
and
evening
to
rejoice
has
come
to
bear
a
clear
and
vivid
meaning
in
this
country
in
this
fiery
latitude
life
is
merely
a
struggle
from
the
time
the
sun
has
been
up
for
two
hours
until
he
sinks
very
low
there
is
nothing
hid
from
the
heat
thereof
one
watches
with
dismay
his
flaming
disc
wheel
into
the
cloudless
sky
to
blaze
and
scintillate
mercilessly
there
for
many
terrible
hours
scorching
withering
destroying
turning
a
fruitful
land
into
a
desert
bringing
eye
diseases
in
his
train
with
sunset
but
not
much
before
comes
a
respite
embittered
by
and
life
begins
to
be
possible
then
darkness
comes
with
a
stride
and
the
day
is
done
among
the
many
people
who
came
to
the
was
a
man
who
had
received
a
severe
sword
cut
in
the
recent
fight
i
disliked
his
expression
and
remarked
on
it
to
mirza
on
the
next
day
march
though
there
were
twelve
men
with
the
caravan
this
man
seized
and
made
off
with
the
handsome
chestnut
horse
karun
which
was
being
led
the
horse
had
a
sore
back
and
soon
kicked
off
his
rider
and
was
recovered
on
the
same
march
mujid
was
attacked
and
under
the
threat
of
being
stripped
was
obliged
to
give
up
all
the
money
he
had
on
his
person
on
the
same
day
some
women
clamorously
demanded
bracelets
and
when
i
did
not
give
them
two
took
hold
of
my
bridle
and
one
of
my
foot
and
were
dragging
me
off
when
on
mirza
coming
up
they
let
me
go
marching
among
lower
hills
and
broader
valleys
irrigated
and
cultivated
with
much
wood
along
the
streams
and
scattered
on
the
lower
slopes
we
passed
the
inhabited
villages
of
tarsa
and
sah
kala
surrounded
by
patches
of
buckwheat
vetches
and
melons
and
with
much
provision
of
for
fuel
on
their
roofs
and
camped
by
the
river
guwa
in
a
grove
of
fine
trees
crossing
its
vigorous
torrent
the
next
morning
by
a
wicker
bridge
the
a
long
ascent
among
oaks
where
the
views
of
mountains
and
ravines
were
grand
an
upland
meadow
where
i
found
a
white
bee
orchis
and
a
steep
ascent
among
stones
brought
us
to
the
top
of
a
pass
feet
in
altitude
on
its
side
there
is
a
very
striking
view
of
gorges
of
immense
depth
and
steepness
through
which
the
guwa
finds
its
way
to
the
the
prospect
is
of
a
very
feeble
country
which
we
entered
by
a
tiresome
gravelly
descent
very
open
composed
of
low
hills
with
outcrops
of
rock
at
their
summits
irrigated
rolling
valleys
and
plains
with
deep
rifts
indicative
of
streams
and
some
magawe
villages
our
route
lay
across
the
most
scorched
and
gravelly
part
of
the
upper
slopes
of
a
wide
valley
scantily
sprinkled
with
blue
and
a
woolly
species
of
a
very
repulsive
region
where
herds
of
camels
kept
for
breeding
purposes
were
grazing
on
the
other
side
of
this
valley
a
spur
of
the
fine
mountain
jalanda
projects
and
on
it
are
the
two
villages
and
fort
of
kalahoma
the
residence
of
taimur
khan
we
halted
below
the
hill
while
a
spring
was
being
searched
for
and
i
was
sitting
on
horseback
eating
my
lunch
a
biscuit
in
one
hand
and
a
cup
in
the
other
i
have
mentioned
the
savagery
of
the
horses
and
especially
of
who
has
become
like
a
wild
beast
he
was
standing
fully
four
away
from
me
with
his
tail
towards
me
and
the
guide
had
let
go
his
bridle
when
there
was
a
roar
or
squeal
and
a
momentary
vision
of
glaring
eyes
streaming
mane
and
open
mouth
rushing
down
upon
me
and
towering
above
head
and
the
next
thing
i
remember
is
finding
myself
on
the
ground
with
my
foot
in
the
stirrup
and
three
men
lifting
me
up
i
was
a
good
deal
shaken
and
cut
my
arm
badly
but
mounted
again
and
though
falling
on
my
head
has
given
me
a
sickish
headache
for
two
days
i
have
not
absolutely
required
rest
and
in
camp
there
is
no
use
in
making
a
fuss
if
indeed
there
ever
is
i
shall
not
have
pleasant
memories
of
this
camp
the
tents
were
scarcely
pitched
before
crowds
assembled
for
medicine
i
could
get
no
rest
for
if
i
shut
the
tent
the
heat
was
unbearable
and
if
i
opened
it
there
was
the
crowd
row
behind
row
the
hindmost
pushing
the
foremost
in
so
that
it
was
before
i
got
any
food
yesterday
morning
at
six
i
was
awakened
by
people
all
round
the
tent
some
shaking
the
curtains
and
calling
m
hak
m
and
though
i
kept
it
shut
till
eleven
and
raised
the
mercury
to
by
doing
so
there
was
no
rest
from
eleven
till
except
for
one
hour
when
i
was
away
at
the
khan
i
was
seeing
patients
wishing
i
were
a
real
instead
of
a
spurious
for
there
was
so
much
suffering
and
some
of
it
i
knew
not
how
to
relieve
however
i
was
able
thanks
to
mary
hospital
london
to
open
three
whitlows
and
two
abscesses
and
it
was
delightful
to
see
the
immediate
relief
of
the
sufferers
god
is
great
they
all
exclaimed
and
the
bystanders
echoed
god
is
great
i
dressed
five
neglected
bullet
wounds
and
sewed
up
a
gash
of
doubtful
origin
and
with
a
little
help
from
mirza
prepared
and
medicines
for
people
i
asked
one
man
in
what
quarrel
he
had
been
shot
and
he
replied
that
he
did
know
his
khan
had
told
him
to
go
and
fight
in
the
afternoon
several
very
distressed
people
were
brought
from
an
armenian
village
ten
miles
off
and
were
laid
by
those
who
brought
them
at
the
tent
door
at
five
the
crowd
was
very
great
and
the
hubbub
inconceivable
and
mirza
failed
to
keep
order
in
the
absence
of
aziz
khan
who
had
gone
on
a
pilgrimage
to
a
neighbouring
the
mercury
had
never
fallen
below
i
had
been
standing
or
kneeling
for
six
hours
and
had
a
racking
headache
so
i
reluctantly
shut
up
my
medicine
chest
and
went
by
invitation
to
call
on
the
khan
wives
but
the
whole
crowd
surrounded
and
followed
me
swelling
as
it
moved
along
a
man
with
a
mare
with
bad
eyes
which
had
been
brought
ten
miles
for
increasing
the
clamour
by
his
urgency
khanum
khanum
lady
chashma
eyes
shikam
stomach
were
shouted
on
all
sides
with
m
hak
m
the
people
even
clutched
my
clothing
and
hands
were
raised
to
heaven
to
implore
blessings
on
me
if
i
would
attend
to
them
the
whole
village
of
kalahoma
was
out
thronging
pressing
and
almost
suffocating
me
and
the
khan
servants
who
came
to
meet
me
did
not
or
could
not
disperse
the
people
though
every
man
holds
his
life
at
the
khan
disposal
these
villages
which
are
surrounded
by
opium
fields
are
composed
of
the
rudest
of
human
habitations
built
of
rough
stones
the
walls
being
only
five
feet
high
there
is
much
subterranean
room
for
cattle
the
stacks
of
such
winter
fodder
as
celery
and
and
those
of
for
fuel
are
larger
than
the
dwellings
the
latter
are
of
conical
form
and
many
of
them
are
built
on
the
house
roofs
taimur
khan
fort
and
are
in
the
midst
of
all
this
and
are
very
poor
and
ruinous
but
the
walls
are
high
and
they
have
a
as
i
approached
the
ladies
came
out
to
meet
me
veiled
in
white
cotton
the
principal
wife
took
my
hand
and
led
me
through
a
hole
in
the
wall
not
to
be
called
a
doorway
into
a
courtyard
littered
with
offal
and
piled
with
stacked
animal
fuel
and
up
some
high
dilapidated
steps
into
a
small
dark
room
outside
of
which
are
a
very
small
lobby
and
a
blackened
ladder
against
the
wall
leading
to
the
roof
on
which
the
ladies
sleep
in
the
hot
weather
some
poor
rugs
covered
the
floor
and
there
were
besides
some
poor
bolsters
everything
even
the
dress
of
the
ladies
indicated
poverty
the
dark
hot
room
was
immediately
packed
with
a
crowd
of
women
children
and
babies
all
appallingly
dirty
it
was
a
relief
when
the
khan
was
announced
in
the
distance
and
they
cleared
out
like
frightened
sheep
leaving
only
the
four
wives
who
stood
up
at
his
approach
and
remained
standing
till
he
was
seated
no
khan
would
pay
me
a
visit
in
his
without
sending
first
with
his
homage
to
know
if
i
would
receive
him
nor
did
taimur
khan
violate
this
rule
or
the
other
of
remaining
standing
until
i
asked
him
to
be
seated
he
is
a
tall
very
man
with
a
turkish
cast
of
face
and
is
dressed
in
the
usual
persian
style
after
a
few
ordinary
commonplaces
he
talked
politics
and
tribal
affairs
frankly
but
who
can
say
if
truthfully
he
knows
that
i
have
letters
from
the
prime
minister
and
he
hoped
that
i
might
do
him
some
good
at
tihran
as
soon
as
important
subjects
superseded
trifles
the
wives
relapsed
into
complete
indifference
and
stared
into
vacancy
his
tribe
the
magawe
is
estimated
at
families
and
has
been
powerful
taimur
khan
is
a
staunch
adherent
of
the
ilkhani
but
at
this
point
there
is
a
change
as
to
the
tribute
half
of
which
is
paid
to
the
ilkhani
and
half
to
the
governor
of
burujird
he
has
many
grievances
and
complains
most
bitterly
that
he
and
his
tribe
are
being
ground
into
poverty
by
exactions
which
he
asserts
have
this
year
raised
the
tribute
from
to
he
asks
me
to
do
something
to
help
him
adding
that
his
house
is
in
ruins
and
that
he
is
so
oppressed
that
he
can
not
build
a
new
one
or
have
any
surroundings
suitable
to
his
rank
i
said
that
i
could
only
send
his
statements
to
the
british
vakil
in
tihran
and
he
at
once
asked
how
many
horses
he
should
present
him
with
i
replied
that
the
vakil
would
not
accept
anything
and
that
he
had
lately
declined
a
superb
diamond
setting
in
which
the
shah
desired
to
send
him
his
picture
the
khan
raised
his
hands
with
the
exclamation
god
is
great
isfandyar
khan
and
taimur
khan
were
at
war
some
years
ago
and
fought
from
mountain
to
mountain
and
taimur
khan
was
eventually
captured
taken
to
burujird
and
sent
to
isfahan
where
he
was
kept
in
irons
for
some
years
the
redoubtable
aziz
khan
being
one
of
his
captors
this
accounts
for
the
disappearance
of
aziz
on
pilgrimage
to
a
neighbouring
and
the
consequent
dulness
of
the
camp
among
a
people
at
once
simple
and
revengeful
it
is
not
unlikely
that
such
severities
may
bear
their
legitimate
fruit
if
an
occasion
presents
itself
such
as
the
embroilment
of
persia
with
any
other
power
another
khan
who
was
thrown
into
prison
and
irons
by
the
expressed
himself
strongly
on
the
subject
five
years
he
said
holding
out
his
muscular
wrists
on
which
the
marks
of
fetters
are
still
visible
i
wore
the
chains
can
i
forget
the
bakhtiaris
do
not
love
the
persians
and
are
held
i
think
by
a
brittle
thread
i
have
written
of
the
extreme
poverty
of
the
surroundings
of
the
khaja
taimur
or
taimur
khan
it
is
not
a
solitary
instance
throughout
this
journey
i
am
painfully
impressed
with
the
poverty
of
the
tribesmen
as
compared
with
the
wealth
of
those
farther
south
when
visited
by
sir
layard
and
the
baron
de
bode
their
condition
is
one
of
destitution
the
ilkhani
and
ilbegi
have
fine
studs
but
few
of
the
khans
have
any
horses
worth
looking
at
and
for
some
time
past
none
at
all
have
been
seen
except
a
few
belonging
to
the
chiefs
and
the
men
either
walk
or
ride
very
small
asses
their
cattle
are
few
and
small
and
their
flocks
insignificant
when
compared
with
those
of
the
arab
tribes
west
of
the
tigris
their
tents
and
furnishings
are
likewise
extremely
poor
and
they
live
poorly
many
of
them
only
able
to
procure
acorn
flour
for
bread
and
this
though
they
grow
a
great
deal
of
grain
and
every
yard
of
land
is
cultivated
if
water
is
procurable
the
hospitality
which
those
two
travellers
mention
as
a
feature
of
the
character
of
the
more
southerly
bakhtiaris
does
not
exist
among
these
people
they
have
in
fact
little
to
be
hospitable
with
they
all
speak
of
better
days
in
the
times
of
their
fathers
when
they
had
brood
mares
and
horses
to
ride
much
pastoral
wealth
and
plenty
of
and
when
their
women
could
wear
jewels
and
strings
of
coins
on
this
point
i
believe
them
though
there
may
possibly
be
exaggeration
in
taimur
khan
statements
persia
has
undoubtedly
tightened
her
grip
upon
them
and
she
is
sucking
their
out
of
them
this
becomes
very
evident
now
that
we
have
reached
a
point
where
the
government
of
burujird
comes
in
with
the
infinite
unrighteousness
of
persian
provincial
governors
it
is
not
the
tribute
fixed
by
the
which
these
khans
complain
of
but
the
rapacious
exactions
of
the
local
governors
there
is
a
blood
feud
between
taimur
khan
and
aslam
khan
the
chief
of
the
zalaki
tribe
on
whose
territory
we
shall
enter
a
nephew
of
taimur
killed
a
relation
of
aslam
and
afterwards
taimur
sheltered
him
from
legitimate
vengeance
just
now
the
feud
is
very
active
and
and
other
reprisals
are
going
on
blood
feuds
are
of
three
degrees
according
to
the
nature
of
the
offence
in
the
first
a
man
of
the
one
tribe
can
kill
a
man
of
the
other
wherever
he
finds
him
in
the
second
he
harries
his
cattle
and
goods
in
the
third
he
simply
boycotts
him
and
refuses
him
a
passage
through
his
territory
the
bakhtiaris
have
often
been
called
bloodthirsty
i
doubt
whether
they
are
so
though
life
is
of
little
account
and
they
are
reckless
about
spilling
blood
they
have
a
great
deal
of
family
devotion
which
in
lesser
degree
extends
to
the
members
of
their
tribe
and
a
bakhtiari
often
spares
the
life
of
a
man
who
has
aggrieved
him
owing
to
his
fear
of
creating
a
blood
feud
which
must
be
transmitted
from
father
to
son
and
which
must
affect
the
whole
tribe
as
a
deterrent
from
acts
of
violence
it
acts
powerfully
and
may
account
for
the
singular
bloodlessness
of
some
of
the
tribal
fights
few
men
unless
carried
away
by
a
whirlwind
of
fury
care
to
involve
a
tribe
in
the
consequences
alluded
to
and
bad
as
the
custom
of
blood
feuds
is
i
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
acts
as
a
curb
upon
the
passions
of
these
wild
tribesmen
there
is
blood
between
us
and
them
is
a
phrase
often
heard
punishments
are
simple
and
deterrent
well
suited
to
a
simple
people
when
a
homicide
is
captured
he
is
handed
over
to
the
relatives
of
the
slain
man
who
may
kill
him
banish
him
fine
him
or
pardon
him
in
point
of
fact
is
paid
to
the
family
of
the
deceased
person
and
to
save
his
life
from
their
vengeance
a
homicide
frequently
becomes
a
mendicant
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountains
till
he
can
gain
the
required
sum
moslem
charity
responds
freely
to
a
claim
for
alms
to
wipe
out
a
blood
stain
the
ilkhani
has
a
right
to
fine
a
homicide
blood
for
blood
is
a
maxim
very
early
inculcated
the
present
feud
between
the
magawe
and
the
zalaki
tribes
is
of
the
first
degree
it
is
undoubtedly
a
part
of
the
truly
oriental
policy
of
persia
to
foment
tribal
quarrels
and
keep
them
going
with
the
object
of
weakening
the
power
of
the
clans
which
though
less
so
than
formerly
is
a
standing
menace
to
the
central
government
on
reaching
camp
after
this
visit
i
found
a
greater
crowd
than
ever
and
as
divers
of
them
came
from
far
i
tried
to
help
them
till
nine
and
as
aziz
had
returned
the
crowding
was
not
so
severe
he
said
you
very
tired
send
these
people
away
you
done
enough
i
answered
that
one
had
never
done
enough
so
long
as
one
could
do
more
and
he
made
a
remark
which
led
me
to
ask
him
if
he
thought
a
could
reach
paradise
he
answered
oh
no
very
hastily
but
after
a
moment
thought
said
i
do
know
god
knows
think
as
we
he
may
be
more
merciful
than
we
think
if
kafirs
fear
god
they
may
have
some
paradise
to
themselves
we
do
know
b
letter
xviii
camp
kala
kuh
the
call
to
boot
and
saddle
was
at
three
and
i
was
nearly
too
tired
to
pack
in
the
sultry
morning
air
the
heat
is
overpowering
khaja
taimur
no
doubt
had
reasons
for
a
difficulty
in
providing
guides
which
caused
delay
the
track
lay
through
pretty
country
with
abounding
herbage
to
the
village
and
of
makhedi
there
the
guide
said
he
dared
not
go
any
farther
for
fear
of
being
killed
and
after
some
time
another
was
procured
during
this
delay
a
crowd
of
handsome
but
women
gathered
round
me
many
of
them
touching
the
handkerchiefs
on
their
heads
and
then
tapping
the
palms
of
their
hands
a
significant
sign
which
throughout
persia
being
interpreted
means
give
me
some
money
the
agha
is
in
the
habit
of
gathering
the
little
girls
about
him
and
giving
them
as
from
his
own
children
a
most
popular
proceeding
usually
but
here
the
people
were
not
friendly
and
very
suspicious
even
the
men
asked
me
clamorously
why
does
he
give
them
money
it
poisoned
it
cursed
it
to
make
them
blind
however
avarice
prevailed
over
fear
the
people
rarely
see
money
and
it
is
not
used
as
a
medium
of
exchange
but
they
value
it
highly
for
paying
the
tribute
and
as
ornaments
for
the
women
barter
is
the
custom
and
with
regard
to
tradesmen
whether
in
camps
or
villages
it
is
usual
for
each
family
to
pay
so
much
grain
annually
to
the
blacksmith
the
carpenter
the
shoemaker
the
man
who
makes
compressed
rag
or
leather
soles
for
and
unites
the
cotton
webbing
upper
to
the
sole
and
the
keeper
in
the
rare
cases
where
there
is
one
they
were
cutting
wheat
on
july
there
at
an
altitude
of
feet
where
there
are
only
camps
the
oxen
tread
it
out
at
once
on
the
hard
soil
of
the
fields
but
where
there
is
a
village
the
sheaves
are
brought
in
on
donkeys
backs
to
a
house
roof
of
clay
and
are
there
trodden
out
the
roofs
being
usually
accessible
from
the
slope
above
we
descended
to
a
deep
ford
crossed
the
river
locally
known
as
kakulistan
or
the
curl
from
its
singular
windings
there
about
sixty
feet
wide
with
clear
rapid
water
of
a
tint
very
strong
and
up
to
the
guide
waist
and
entered
a
stony
valley
where
the
heat
was
simply
sickening
there
the
second
guide
left
us
saying
he
should
be
killed
if
he
went
any
farther
but
another
was
willing
to
succeed
him
after
a
steep
ascent
we
emerged
on
a
broad
rolling
upland
valley
deeply
gashed
by
a
stream
with
the
grand
range
of
the
kala
kuh
on
the
south
side
and
low
bare
hills
on
the
north
it
is
now
populous
the
valley
and
hillsides
are
spotted
with
large
camps
and
the
question
at
once
arose
hostile
or
friendly
i
was
riding
as
usual
with
mirza
behind
me
when
a
man
with
a
gun
rushed
frantically
towards
me
from
an
adjacent
camp
waving
his
gun
and
shouting
who
are
you
why
are
you
in
our
country
you
friends
of
khaja
taimur
you
given
him
presents
we
rob
you
with
these
and
many
similar
words
he
pursued
us
and
men
started
up
as
by
magic
with
long
guns
running
alongside
the
low
spurs
became
covered
with
people
in
no
time
and
there
was
much
signalling
from
hill
to
hill
and
sending
of
messengers
mirza
pacified
them
by
saying
that
we
are
friends
of
isfandyar
khan
and
that
i
have
presents
for
aslam
khan
their
chief
but
soon
the
shout
of
feringhis
was
raised
and
from
group
to
group
along
the
knolls
swelled
the
cry
of
feringhis
feringhis
mixed
with
a
few
shouts
of
but
without
actual
molestation
we
reached
a
steep
and
uncomfortable
at
an
altitude
of
feet
with
an
extensive
view
of
the
broad
green
valley
before
we
halted
aslam
khan
a
very
man
and
others
met
us
and
performed
feats
of
horsemanship
wheeling
their
horses
in
small
circles
at
a
gallop
and
firing
pantomimically
over
their
left
shoulders
and
right
flanks
the
sahib
came
in
later
so
that
our
party
was
a
tolerably
strong
one
the
first
thing
the
people
did
was
to
crowd
into
the
and
lie
down
staring
fixedly
a
thing
which
never
happened
before
and
groups
steadily
occupied
the
tops
of
the
adjacent
spurs
after
my
tent
was
pitched
the
people
assembled
round
it
in
such
numbers
ostensibly
desiring
medicine
that
the
khan
sent
two
to
keep
order
among
them
and
karim
whose
arm
is
now
well
was
added
as
a
protection
the
agha
ordered
that
the
people
should
sit
in
rows
at
the
sides
and
take
their
turn
one
at
a
time
to
come
into
the
verandah
but
no
sooner
were
he
and
aziz
khan
out
of
sight
than
they
began
to
crowd
to
shout
and
to
become
unmanageable
scuffling
and
pushing
the
pretending
to
beat
them
with
the
barrels
of
their
guns
but
really
encouraging
them
and
at
length
going
away
saying
they
could
not
manage
them
karim
begged
me
to
stop
giving
medicine
for
he
was
overpowered
and
if
he
opposed
them
any
more
there
would
be
a
fight
they
had
said
that
if
he
spoke
another
word
they
would
kill
him
they
were
perfectly
all
the
time
but
acted
like
complete
savages
getting
under
the
tugging
at
the
tent
ropes
and
trying
to
pull
my
blankets
off
the
bed
etc
at
last
the
hindmost
gave
a
sudden
push
sending
the
foremost
tumbling
into
the
tent
and
over
me
upsetting
a
large
open
packet
of
sulphate
of
zinc
just
arrived
from
julfa
which
was
on
my
lap
i
left
the
tent
to
avoid
further
mischief
but
was
nearly
suffocated
by
their
crowding
and
tugging
my
dress
shouting
m
hak
m
the
sahib
who
came
to
the
rescue
and
urged
them
in
persian
to
depart
was
quite
powerless
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
the
khan
wives
and
daughter
came
to
visit
me
but
i
could
only
show
them
the
crowd
and
walk
followed
by
it
in
the
opposite
direction
from
the
tent
till
i
met
the
agha
whose
presence
restored
order
that
night
nearly
all
hadji
or
mule
blankets
and
a
donkey
were
stolen
the
zalakis
are
a
large
and
powerful
tribe
predatory
by
habit
and
tradition
aslam
khan
himself
directed
certain
thefts
from
which
we
suffered
and
quoted
a
passage
from
the
koran
not
only
to
extenuate
but
to
warrant
depredations
on
the
goods
of
infidels
sunday
was
spent
in
the
hubbub
of
a
crowd
i
was
suffering
somewhat
from
a
fall
and
yet
more
from
the
fatigues
of
kalahoma
and
longed
for
rest
but
the
temperature
of
the
tent
when
closed
was
and
when
open
the
people
crowded
at
the
entrance
ostensibly
for
medicine
but
many
from
a
pardonable
and
scarcely
disguised
curiosity
to
see
the
feringhi
and
hear
her
speak
in
the
afternoon
with
mirza
and
karim
as
a
guard
i
went
somewhat
reluctantly
to
the
khan
camp
to
return
the
abortive
visit
of
the
ladies
this
camp
consists
of
a
number
of
black
tents
arranged
in
a
circle
the
khan
tents
only
distinguishable
from
the
rest
by
their
larger
size
mares
dogs
sheep
goats
and
fireholes
were
in
the
centre
and
some
horses
were
tethered
outside
the
khan
mother
a
fine
buxom
but
woman
met
me
and
took
me
to
an
open
tent
fully
forty
feet
long
the
back
of
which
was
banked
up
by
handsome
bolsters
and
rugs
were
laid
in
the
middle
on
which
the
four
legitimate
wives
and
several
inferior
ones
with
a
quantity
of
babies
and
children
crawling
about
them
were
seated
among
them
was
a
very
handsome
girl
of
eighteen
the
khan
daughter
pleasing
in
expression
and
graceful
in
manner
she
is
married
to
a
son
of
taimur
khan
but
he
does
not
care
for
her
and
has
practically
discarded
her
which
adds
insult
to
the
blood
feud
previously
existing
after
i
entered
the
tent
the
whole
camp
population
male
and
female
crowded
in
pressing
upon
us
with
clamour
indescribable
the
mother
slapped
the
wives
if
they
attempted
to
speak
and
conducted
herself
like
a
ruling
virago
occasionally
shrieking
at
the
crowd
while
a
with
a
heavy
stick
belaboured
all
within
his
reach
and
those
not
belaboured
yelled
with
laughter
the
senior
lady
beckoned
mirza
to
lean
towards
her
and
told
him
in
a
whisper
that
her
handsome
granddaughter
is
hated
and
despised
by
her
husband
and
has
been
sent
back
with
a
baby
a
year
old
he
having
taken
another
wife
and
that
she
wanted
me
to
give
her
a
love
philtre
that
would
answer
the
double
purpose
of
giving
her
back
his
love
and
making
her
rival
hateful
in
his
eyes
during
this
whispered
conference
as
many
as
could
reach
leant
close
to
the
speakers
like
the
savages
that
they
are
i
replied
that
i
knew
of
no
such
philtres
that
if
the
girl
beauty
and
sweetness
could
not
retain
her
husband
love
there
was
no
remedy
she
said
she
knew
i
had
them
and
that
i
kept
them
as
well
as
potions
for
making
favourite
wives
ugly
and
odious
to
their
husbands
in
a
leather
box
with
a
gold
key
then
many
headaches
and
sore
eyes
were
brought
and
a
and
tea
and
i
distributed
presents
in
a
babel
in
which
anything
but
the
most
staccato
style
of
conversation
was
impossible
when
i
left
the
crowd
surged
after
me
and
a
sharp
stone
was
thrown
which
cut
through
my
cloak
later
aslam
khan
his
brothers
and
the
usual
train
of
retainers
called
he
is
a
very
man
six
feet
high
with
a
most
sinister
expression
and
a
look
at
times
which
inspired
me
with
the
deepest
distrust
of
him
his
robber
tribe
numbers
souls
and
he
says
that
he
can
bring
armed
horsemen
into
the
field
he
too
asked
for
medicine
for
headache
not
only
is
there
a
blood
feud
between
him
and
khaja
taimur
but
between
him
and
mirab
khan
through
whose
valley
we
must
pass
in
the
evening
the
khan
mother
returned
with
several
women
bent
on
getting
the
love
philtre
at
night
hadji
who
was
watching
said
that
men
were
prowling
round
the
tents
at
all
hours
and
a
few
things
were
taken
on
monday
morning
early
all
was
ready
for
the
three
caravans
from
that
day
were
to
march
together
and
i
was
sitting
on
my
horse
talking
with
the
sahib
waiting
for
the
agha
to
return
from
the
khan
camp
when
he
rushed
down
the
slope
exclaiming
there
mischief
and
i
crossed
the
stream
and
watched
it
about
twenty
men
with
loaded
sticks
had
surrounded
mujid
and
were
beating
him
and
finally
got
him
down
i
leapt
back
to
my
own
camp
where
hassan
and
karim
were
taking
a
parting
smoke
and
ordered
them
to
the
rescue
the
soldier
rushed
into
the
armed
with
only
a
cane
which
was
broken
at
once
and
the
bakhtiaris
got
him
by
his
thick
hair
and
all
but
forced
him
down
but
he
fought
like
a
bulldog
and
so
did
hassan
who
was
unarmed
and
got
two
bad
cuts
dashed
too
into
the
fray
hadji
hussein
who
fought
like
a
bull
followed
by
his
muleteers
and
by
abbas
ali
who
being
early
knocked
down
hung
on
to
a
man
arm
with
his
teeth
the
sahib
who
was
endeavouring
to
make
peace
was
untouched
possibly
because
of
his
lineage
and
faith
and
he
yelled
to
mirza
who
in
a
fight
is
of
no
account
to
run
for
the
agha
whose
presence
is
worth
fifty
men
meanwhile
a
number
of
zalakis
armed
two
with
guns
and
the
rest
with
loaded
sticks
crowded
round
me
using
menacing
gestures
and
calling
me
a
on
which
i
took
my
revolver
out
of
the
holster
and
very
slowly
examined
the
chambers
though
i
knew
well
that
all
were
loaded
this
had
an
excellent
effect
they
fell
back
and
were
just
dispersing
when
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
cantered
aziz
khan
followed
by
the
agha
who
galloping
down
the
slope
fired
a
revolver
twice
over
the
head
of
a
man
who
was
running
away
who
having
stolen
a
sheep
and
being
caught
in
the
act
by
mujid
had
begun
the
fray
aslam
khan
followed
and
the
men
say
gave
the
order
to
fire
but
recalled
it
on
finding
that
one
of
his
tribesmen
had
been
the
aggressor
i
thought
he
took
the
matter
very
coolly
and
he
almost
immediately
told
mirza
to
ask
me
for
a
penknife
after
this
we
started
the
orders
being
for
the
caravans
to
keep
well
together
and
if
we
were
absolutely
attacked
to
fire
after
ascending
a
spur
of
the
kala
kuh
we
left
the
track
for
an
ilyat
camp
on
a
steep
hill
among
oaks
and
pears
where
i
had
promised
to
see
a
young
creature
very
ill
of
fever
among
the
trees
was
a
small
booth
of
four
poles
roofed
with
celery
stalks
but
without
sides
or
ends
and
in
this
on
a
sheepskin
was
a
heap
out
of
which
protruded
two
white
wasted
arms
i
uncovered
the
back
of
a
head
which
turned
slowly
and
revealed
in
a
setting
of
masses
of
heavy
shining
hair
the
white
face
of
a
young
girl
with
large
brilliant
eyes
and
very
beautiful
teeth
her
pulse
was
fluttering
feebly
and
i
told
the
crowd
that
death
was
very
near
for
fear
they
should
think
i
had
poisoned
her
with
the
few
drops
of
stimulant
that
she
was
able
to
swallow
even
here
the
death
penalty
sometimes
follows
the
joy
of
maternity
she
died
in
the
evening
and
now
nothing
remains
of
the
camp
but
a
heap
of
ashes
for
these
people
always
at
once
leave
the
where
a
death
has
occurred
meanwhile
the
agha
was
making
friends
with
the
people
and
giving
to
the
children
as
is
his
habit
scarcely
had
we
left
when
he
found
that
he
had
been
robbed
of
a
fine
pair
of
binocular
glasses
almost
a
necessity
under
the
circumstances
english
rifles
binoculars
and
watches
are
all
coveted
by
the
bakhtiaris
aziz
khan
became
very
grave
and
full
of
dismal
prophecies
regarding
the
remainder
of
the
journey
after
this
divergence
the
scenery
was
magnificent
the
kala
kuh
range
is
certainly
finer
than
the
zard
kuh
it
is
more
broken
up
into
peaks
of
definite
outline
and
is
more
deeply
cut
by
gorges
many
of
them
the
beds
of
torrents
densely
wooded
in
fact
it
is
less
of
a
and
more
of
a
the
route
lay
among
huge
steep
mountains
of
naked
rock
cut
up
by
narrow
deep
and
gigantic
clefts
from
whose
depths
rise
spires
of
rock
and
stupendous
almost
perpendicular
cliffs
green
torrents
flecked
with
foam
boom
through
the
shadows
or
flash
in
the
sunlight
margined
wherever
it
is
possible
by
walnuts
oaks
lilacs
roses
the
and
an
entanglement
of
greenery
revelling
in
spray
a
steep
zigzag
descent
through
oak
and
pear
trees
brought
us
to
the
vigorous
torrent
white
water
one
of
many
of
the
same
name
crossed
by
a
natural
bridge
of
shelving
rock
slippery
from
much
use
one
of
the
arabs
so
nearly
fell
on
this
that
i
dismounted
and
just
as
i
did
so
abbas
ali
mule
fell
on
his
side
and
following
did
the
same
breaking
several
things
in
the
holster
after
crossing
a
deep
ravine
abbas
ali
sprang
back
down
the
steep
to
it
and
the
sahib
who
was
behind
also
ran
down
with
three
men
to
what
was
evidently
a
disaster
mirza
mule
had
fallen
over
twenty
feet
rolling
over
him
three
times
with
its
load
hurting
his
knee
badly
the
sahib
said
he
never
saw
so
narrow
an
escape
from
a
broken
neck
the
loss
of
a
bottle
containing
a
quart
of
milk
was
the
chief
damage
a
little
farther
up
three
men
were
tugging
up
to
the
track
by
the
tail
it
was
a
very
steep
ascent
by
stony
broken
zigzags
and
ledges
to
the
fairly
level
top
of
a
spur
of
the
kala
kuh
range
with
a
high
battlemented
hill
behind
at
the
back
of
which
dwell
robber
hordes
and
many
seyyids
who
pay
no
tribute
and
are
generally
feared
at
this
open
breezy
height
of
feet
the
camps
have
been
pitched
for
three
days
and
of
the
many
which
we
have
hitherto
occupied
i
like
it
the
best
so
lofty
is
it
so
lonely
so
mysterious
and
unexplored
it
has
a
glorious
view
of
tremendous
wooded
ravines
down
which
green
waters
glide
or
tumble
of
small
plateaux
among
woods
and
of
green
peaks
in
the
foreground
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
narrow
sinuous
valley
several
thousand
feet
below
there
is
a
confused
mass
of
mountains
among
which
the
southern
faces
of
the
peaks
of
the
zard
kuh
and
the
grand
bulk
of
a
mountain
of
the
faidun
range
are
the
most
prominent
five
thousand
feet
below
reached
by
a
remarkable
track
is
basnoi
a
lonely
depth
with
successive
terraces
of
figs
pomegranates
and
walnuts
dense
woods
and
a
luxuriant
undergrowth
of
long
grass
and
ferns
among
them
are
the
remains
of
an
ancient
road
of
good
width
and
construction
and
of
a
very
fine
bridge
of
small
blocks
of
stone
with
three
arches
now
ruined
with
fine
piers
and
stone
abutments
the
centre
arch
having
a
span
of
sixty
feet
the
roadway
of
the
bridge
is
gone
and
a
crazy
wicker
framework
is
suspended
in
its
place
the
bakhtiaris
attribute
these
relics
of
an
extinct
civilisation
to
shapur
one
of
the
three
kings
of
that
name
who
reigned
in
the
third
and
fourth
centuries
all
these
green
waters
fall
into
the
before
sunset
heads
of
men
and
barrels
of
guns
were
seen
over
the
rocky
cliff
behind
us
we
had
been
warned
against
the
outlaw
tribes
of
that
region
and
had
been
told
that
they
were
preparing
to
rob
the
camp
that
night
with
thirty
men
and
had
declared
that
if
they
failed
they
would
dog
us
till
they
succeeded
this
news
was
brought
by
aslam
khan
brother
in
the
afternoon
i
asked
aziz
with
how
much
i
should
reach
burujird
and
he
answered
it
well
if
you
take
your
life
there
this
and
a
whole
crop
of
other
rumours
magnified
as
they
passed
from
man
to
man
produced
a
novel
excitement
in
the
lonely
camps
hadji
buried
his
money
of
which
he
had
a
large
sum
and
lay
down
upon
it
rifles
and
revolvers
were
cleaned
and
loaded
swords
and
knives
sharpened
voices
were
loud
and
ceaseless
and
those
who
were
slightly
hurt
in
the
morning
fray
recounted
their
adventures
over
and
over
again
all
dispositions
for
safety
were
carefully
made
before
night
hassan
who
has
a
horse
and
large
property
in
good
clothes
wanted
a
revolver
but
was
wisely
refused
on
the
ground
that
to
arm
undisciplined
men
indiscriminately
would
be
to
run
a
great
risk
of
being
ourselves
shot
in
any
confusion
there
were
then
four
men
with
rifles
five
with
revolvers
and
aslam
khan
brother
and
two
with
guns
about
eight
the
bakhtiari
was
several
times
repeated
and
i
wondered
if
it
were
foe
or
friend
till
aziz
answering
signal
rang
out
loud
and
clear
announcing
that
it
was
friends
of
isfandyar
khan
shortly
i
heard
the
plot
thickens
and
the
friends
turned
out
to
be
another
brother
of
aslam
khan
with
four
and
a
promise
of
eight
more
who
never
arrived
according
to
these
men
reliable
information
had
been
received
that
khaja
taimur
our
friend
of
kalahoma
was
sending
forty
men
to
rob
us
on
aslam
khan
territory
in
order
to
get
him
into
trouble
this
arrival
increased
the
excitement
among
the
men
who
piled
tamarisk
and
the
gum
tragacanth
bush
on
the
fires
most
recklessly
the
wild
hooded
and
their
long
guns
being
picturesque
in
the
firelight
i
am
all
but
positively
sure
that
the
rumour
was
invented
by
aslam
khan
in
order
to
show
his
vigilant
care
of
guests
and
secure
from
their
gratitude
the
possession
of
an
english
rifle
hadji
came
to
my
tent
telling
me
not
to
be
the
least
afraid
for
they
would
not
harm
a
lady
the
agha
has
a
resource
for
every
emergency
the
sahib
is
cool
and
brave
and
besides
that
i
strongly
suspected
the
whole
thing
to
be
a
ruse
of
aslam
khan
whom
i
distrust
thoroughly
at
all
events
i
was
asleep
very
early
and
was
only
disturbed
twice
by
aziz
calling
to
know
if
my
servants
were
watching
and
was
only
awakened
at
five
by
the
sahib
and
the
agha
going
past
my
tent
giving
orders
that
any
stranger
approaching
the
camp
was
to
be
warned
off
and
was
to
be
fired
upon
if
he
disregarded
the
warning
a
blissfully
quiet
day
followed
the
excitement
of
the
night
before
the
men
slept
after
their
long
watch
and
the
fighting
horses
were
at
a
distance
the
agha
did
not
return
and
for
a
day
and
night
i
was
the
only
european
in
camp
aziz
khan
with
an
english
rifle
a
hundred
cartridges
and
two
revolvers
in
his
belt
kept
faithful
watch
and
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
i
walked
through
the
camp
twice
during
the
night
to
see
that
the
men
on
guard
were
awake
before
midnight
there
was
a
frightful
row
for
two
hours
which
sounded
as
if
fifty
men
were
taking
part
in
it
i
have
often
wondered
at
the
idiotic
things
that
hassan
does
and
at
the
hopelessly
dazed
way
in
which
he
sometimes
stands
now
it
has
come
out
that
he
is
smoking
more
and
more
opium
and
has
been
supplying
karim
with
it
mujid
who
was
formerly
the
agha
cook
has
been
promoted
to
be
rules
the
caravan
on
the
march
heads
it
on
a
fine
horse
keeps
accounts
and
is
generally
confidential
karim
resents
all
this
he
lately
bought
a
horse
because
he
could
not
bear
to
ride
a
baggage
mule
when
the
other
man
was
well
mounted
and
being
that
night
mad
with
opium
and
being
armed
both
with
rifle
and
revolver
with
which
he
threatened
to
kill
mujid
it
was
only
by
the
united
and
efforts
of
all
the
men
that
bloodshed
was
prevented
the
next
day
hassan
destroyed
his
opium
pipe
and
is
trying
to
cure
himself
of
the
habit
with
the
aid
of
morphia
but
he
complains
of
agony
in
the
waist
which
is
just
the
fearful
craving
which
the
disuse
of
the
drug
causes
the
agha
encountered
very
predatory
lurs
in
the
lower
regions
a
mule
was
stolen
by
two
lurs
then
robbed
from
them
by
three
who
in
their
turn
were
obliged
to
surrender
it
to
some
passing
ilyats
from
whom
he
recovered
it
while
he
was
resting
at
night
he
was
awakened
by
hearing
some
lurs
who
had
joined
them
discussing
the
practicability
of
robbing
him
but
when
one
told
the
others
that
he
had
found
out
that
the
feringhi
has
six
shots
they
gave
it
up
at
this
camp
we
are
only
a
few
days
march
from
classic
ground
the
ancient
elam
with
its
capital
of
susa
and
the
remains
of
so
fine
a
bridge
with
the
unusual
feature
still
to
be
distinctly
traced
of
level
approaches
the
adjacent
ruins
and
the
tradition
of
an
route
a
broad
road
having
followed
the
to
the
plains
of
lower
elam
all
point
to
an
earlier
and
higher
civilisation
overlooking
the
bridge
on
the
left
bank
of
the
a
large
square
enclosure
with
large
stone
slabs
inside
was
found
which
had
probably
been
used
for
a
cistern
and
outside
there
were
distinct
traces
of
an
aqueduct
the
sang
niwishta
inscribed
stone
which
has
been
talked
about
for
a
hundred
miles
and
promised
to
be
a
great
discovery
was
investigated
by
a
most
laborious
march
and
turned
out
a
great
disappointment
it
was
to
be
hoped
indeed
it
might
have
been
expected
that
a
journey
through
these
till
now
unexplored
regions
would
have
resulted
in
the
discovery
of
additional
records
of
the
past
carved
in
stone
but
such
is
not
the
case
still
it
is
something
to
have
learned
that
even
here
there
was
once
a
higher
civilisation
and
that
in
its
day
there
was
great
traffic
along
the
basnoi
road
and
that
every
route
through
this
upper
elam
whether
from
north
west
or
east
from
the
persian
highlands
to
the
plains
of
arabistan
and
the
then
populous
banks
of
the
kerkhah
must
have
passed
through
the
great
gap
below
the
gokun
sahid
guwa
and
any
number
of
other
streams
fall
into
this
which
is
the
channel
for
the
drainage
of
faraidan
and
after
a
course
joins
the
which
drains
the
plain
of
silakhor
the

forming
the
on
which
the
now
famous
town
of
dizful
lit
or
bridge
of
diz
is
situated
july
on
july
we
retraced
our
steps
to
and
camped
on
a
height
above
aslam
khan
tents
on
ground
so
steep
that
the
tent
floor
had
to
be
cut
into
steps
with
a
spade
aslam
khan
and
others
came
to
meet
us
again
performing
feats
of
horsemanship
no
sooner
were
the
tents
pitched
than
the
crowd
assembled
and
it
was
another
noisy
and
fagging
day
among
the
things
taken
from
my
tent
were
an
umbrella
knife
scissors
and
most
of
my
slender
stock
of
underclothing
the
scissors
and
cotton
were
taken
by
a
young
of
the
khan
while
i
was
attending
to
a
terrible
hurt
outside
it
turns
out
that
aslam
khan
has
got
the
binocular
and
that
he
told
his
men
to
acquire
a
small
but
very
powerful
telescope
which
he
coveted
my
milk
bottle
in
a
leather
has
a
likeness
to
it
and
this
morning
as
i
was
giving
a
woman
some
her
son
withdrew
this
almost
under
my
eyes
the
khan
face
is
a
most
faithful
reproduction
of
that
of
judas
in
leonardo
da
vinci
last
supper
he
is
so
that
one
is
surprised
that
he
should
condescend
to
do
small
mean
things
i
sent
him
the
knife
he
asked
for
and
soon
he
called
and
asked
for
a
bigger
one
he
passed
off
his
handsome
daughter
the
wife
of
taimur
son
as
his
wife
in
order
to
get
through
her
a
which
he
coveted
they
brought
a
woman
to
me
who
might
have
been
produced
from
a
london
slum
ophthalmia
in
one
eye
the
other
closed
up
and
black
and
behind
it
and
through
her
nose
a
deep
wound
gaping
fully
an
inch
blood
caked
thick
and
black
all
over
her
face
and
matting
her
hair
her
upper
lip
cut
through
and
two
teeth
knocked
out
a
regular
hospital
case
her
brother
they
said
had
quarrelled
with
her
and
had
thrown
stones
at
her
only
the
day
before
but
they
had
already
filled
up
the
wounds
with
some
horrible
paste
i
asked
sardah
khan
why
the
khan
did
not
have
the
man
thrashed
for
such
a
brutality
and
he
replied
that
no
one
would
touch
him
as
he
had
killed
three
men
last
winter
i
spent
two
hours
upon
the
poor
creature
and
the
relief
was
so
great
that
her
gratitude
was
profuse
and
the
blessings
invoked
manifold
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
me
but
many
things
were
taken
out
of
the
tent
while
i
sat
outside
attending
to
her
the
khan
brothers
with
their
long
guns
seyyids
with
their
green
turbans
and
contemptuous
scowl
women
and
children
were
all
pressing
upon
me
hindering
and
suffocating
me
in
a
temperature
of
nearly
they
seem
to
have
no
feeling
for
pain
or
shrinking
from
painful
spectacles
and
rather
to
enjoy
the
groans
of
the
sufferer
each
time
a
piece
of
stone
was
taken
out
of
the
wounds
they
exclaimed
god
is
great
occasionally
when
the
crush
interfered
with
what
i
was
doing
a
man
beat
them
with
his
gun
or
aziz
khan
threw
stones
at
them
but
it
was
useless
the
people
tell
our
men
that
have
never
before
entered
their
valley
and
that
if
we
were
not
under
the
shah
protection
they
would
take
all
that
we
have
i
imagine
that
the
difficulties
are
far
greater
than
i
know
for
the
agha
who
minimises
all
danger
remarked
last
night
that
this
is
a
most
anxious
time
and
that
he
should
be
most
thankful
to
get
every
one
out
of
the
country
for
it
was
impossible
to
say
what
a
day
might
bring
forth
all
idea
of
my
returning
to
julfa
is
now
abandoned
bad
as
it
is
it
is
safer
to
go
on
as
the
welcome
darkness
fell
the
hillsides
near
and
far
blazed
with
fires
and
aslam
khan
camp
immediately
below
was
a
very
picturesque
sight
its
tents
forming
a
circle
with
the
khan
two
tents
in
the
middle
each
having
a
fire
in
front
supper
was
prepared
in
large
pots
the
men
ate
first
then
the
women
children
and
dogs
the
noise
suggested
pandemonium
the
sheep
and
goats
bleated
the
big
dogs
barked
the
men
and
women
shouted
and
shrieked
all
together
at
the
top
of
their
voices
rude
musical
instruments
brayed
and
clanged
it
sounded
diabolical
doubtless
the
inroad
of
the
feringhis
was
the
topic
of
talk
savage
life
does
not
bear
a
near
view
its
total
lack
of
privacy
its
rough
brutality
its
dirt
its
undisguised
greed
its
unconcealed
jealousies
and
hatreds
its
falseness
its
pure
selfishness
and
its
treachery
are
all
painful
on
a
close
inspection
the
following
morning
early
we
came
up
to
the
gunak
the
narrow
top
of
a
pass
in
the
kala
kuh
range
with
an
altitude
of
feet
crossing
on
the
way
a
steep
and
difficult
and
have
halted
here
for
two
days
marching
with
the
caravan
is
a
necessary
precaution
but
a
most
tedious
and
fatiguing
arrangement
no
more
galloping
only
a
crawl
at
caravan
pace
about
two
and
a
half
miles
an
hour
for
five
six
or
seven
hours
and
though
one
is
up
at
it
is
fully
five
before
the
mules
are
under
way
and
meantime
one
is
the
centre
of
that
everlasting
crowd
which
on
some
pretext
or
other
asks
for
medicine
if
no
ailment
can
be
produced
at
present
then
the
request
is
give
me
something
from
the
leather
box
i
a
cough
in
the
winter
or
an
uncovered
copper
bowl
is
brought
the
contents
of
which
would
evaporate
in
a
fortnight
in
this
climate
with
the
plaint
i
a
brother
or
some
other
relative
who
has
sore
eyes
in
spring
please
give
me
some
nothing
is
appreciated
made
from
their
own
valuable
medicinal
herbs
feringhi
medicine
is
all
they
care
for
and
in
their
eyes
every
feringhi
is
a
i
have
often
wondered
that
the
moslem
contempt
for
women
does
not
prevent
even
the
highest
chiefs
from
seeking
a
woman
medical
help
but
their
own
of
whom
there
are
a
few
though
i
have
never
seen
any
are
mostly
women
and
the
profession
is
hereditary
the
men
they
say
are
too
unsettled
to
be
some
of
these
women
are
renowned
for
their
skill
as
bullet
extractors
if
a
father
happens
to
have
any
medical
knowledge
he
communicates
it
to
his
daughter
rather
than
to
his
son
aziz
grandmother
learned
medicine
from
a
native
indian
doctor
in
fars
and
his
mother
had
a
repute
as
a
bullet
extractor
a
woman
extracted
the
three
bullets
by
which
he
has
been
wounded
the
fees
are
very
high
but
depend
entirely
on
the
cure
a
poor
man
pays
for
the
extraction
of
a
bullet
and
the
cure
of
the
wound
from
fifteen
to
twenty
from
to
a
rich
man
from
forty
to
sixty
in
all
cases
they
only
give
medicine
so
long
as
they
think
there
is
hope
of
recovery
and
have
no
knowledge
of
any
treatment
which
can
alleviate
the
sufferings
of
the
dying
when
death
seems
inevitable
they
stuff
the
nose
with
a
paste
made
of
aromatic
herbs
they
dress
wounds
with
an
astringent
paste
made
from
a
very
small
found
on
one
species
of
oak
for
dyspeptic
pains
and
bad
blood
they
eat
bitumen
for
which
is
common
they
keep
the
bitten
person
moving
about
and
apply
the
back
part
of
live
hens
to
the
wound
till
the
hens
cease
to
be
affected
or
else
the
intestines
of
a
goat
newly
killed
for
rheumatism
headache
and
debility
they
have
no
remedies
but
for
fever
they
use
an
infusion
of
willow
bark
which
is
not
efficacious
they
have
great
faith
in
amulets
and
charms
and
in
chewing
and
swallowing
verses
of
the
koran
in
case
of
illness
they
are
rigid
abstainers
and
is
not
to
be
procured
in
the
bakhtiari
country
this
partly
accounts
for
the
extreme
and
almost
startling
rapidity
of
the
healing
of
surgical
wounds
ophthalmia
glaucoma
bulging
eyeballs
inflamed
eyes
and
eyelids
eczema
rheumatism
dyspepsia
and
coughs
are
the
prevailing
maladies
and
among
men
bad
headaches
which
they
describe
as
periodical
and
incapacitating
are
common
the
skin
maladies
and
some
of
the
eye
maladies
come
from
dirt
and
the
parasites
which
are
its
offspring
among
the
common
people
the
clothes
are
only
washed
once
a
year
and
then
in
cold
water
with
the
root
of
a
very
sticky
soap
wort
they
attribute
all
ailments
but
those
of
the
skin
and
eyes
to
wind
rheumatism
doubtless
comes
from
sleeping
in
cotton
clothing
and
little
enough
of

on
the

in

than

possession

which
refreshed

but
did
not

of

we
descended
crossed
the

with
populous
camps
into

of

where
the

castellated
and
nearly
inaccessible
rock
of

height
at
this

where

we
were
obliged
to
camp
close
to
some

which
involved

and
much

we
were
then
in

khan
the
chief
of
the
isawand
tribe
between
whom
and
aslam
khan
there
is
a
blood
feud
with
most
deadly
enmity
he
sent
word
that
he
was
not
well
and
asked
the
agha
to
go
to
see
him
which
he
did
telling
him
that
the
would
also
visit
him
later
taking
mirza
and
two
guides
i
forded
and
followed
up
the
for
two
miles
by
a
most
remarkable
cañon
the
lower
part
of
its
sides
is
steep
and
rocky
though
not
too
steep
for
the
growth
of
tamarisk
scrub
and
much
herbage
but
above
are
prodigious
conglomerate
cliffs
and
below
the
river
which
narrows
to
a
stream
is
concealed
by
enormous
masses
of
conglomerate
rock
this
cleft
must
be
fully
feet
below
the

which
surround
it
a

runs
across
it

and
the

passes
underground
the

of

are
reached
by
a
frightfully
steep
ascent
arjanak
has
been
built
for
security
on
some
narrow
ledges
below
these
colossal
walls
it
is
a
mere
eyrie
a
collection
of
rude
stone
hovels
one
above
the
other
among
which
the
khan
house
is
distinguishable
only
by
its
and
larger
size
the
paths
on
the
dusty
hillside
are
so
narrow
and
shelving
that
i
needed
a
helping
hand
as
well
as
a
stick
to
enable
me
to
reach
a
small
oblong
platform
under
some
willow
trees
where
mirab
khan
received
me
with
a
very
seyyid
scribe
seated
by
him
in
front
of
a
and
tea
equipage
from
which
he
produced
delicious
tea
flavoured
with
the
khan
was
courteous
he
rose
and
did
not
sit
down
till
i
did
he
is
a
most
man
very
tall
and
thin
with
faded
lustreless
gray
eyes
hollow
sallow
cheeks
and
a
very
lank
ugly
beard
light
brown
in
the
middle
he
and
khaja
taimur
look
more
like
decayed
merchants
than
chiefs
of
tribes
of
armed
horsemen
i
was
very
sorry
for
him
for
he
evidently
suffers
much
but
then
and
afterwards
he
impressed
me
unfavourably
and
i
much
doubt
his
good
faith
he
said
he
heard
i
should
spend
two
or
three
days
at
arjanak
and
all
he
had
was
mine
he
was
not
like
some
people
he
said
who
professed
great
friendship
for
people
and
then
forgot
all
about
them
when
i
make
a
friendship
he
said
it
is
for
ever
i
asked
him
if
his
tribe
was
at
peace
peace
he
replied
sententiously
is
a
word
unknown
to
the
bakhtiaris
in
fact
he
has
more
than
one
blood
feud
on
hand
he
complained
bitterly
of
the
exactions
of
persia
and
added
the
conjecture
expressed
by
many
others
that
england
would
shortly
occupy
luristan
and
give
them
equity
and
security
another
khan
of
some
power
said
to
me
that
if
england
were
to
occupy
persia
he
would
help
her
with
horsemen
and
added
an
english
fleet
at
basrah
with
an
english
army
on
board
would
be
the
best
sight
which
bakhtiari
eyes
could
see
i
had
to
hear
the
long
story
of
the
khan
complicated
maladies
to
look
at
many
bad
eyes
and
at
the
wounds
of
a
poor
fellow
suffering
from
who
was
carried
on
another
man
back
and
to
promise
to
bring
up
my
medicine
chest
the
following
day
the
fame
of
the
leather
box
having
reached
arjanak
on
my
way
i
had
called
at
the
and
the
ladies
accompanied
me
to
the
conduct
which
i
think
was
not
approved
of
as
they
told
me
the
next
morning
that
they
must
not
go
there
after
the
agha
returned
the
three
wives
and
many
other
women
clustered
timidly
round
me
two
of
them
are
very
bright
and
pretty
and
one
a
persian
very
affectionate
in
her
manner
she
held
my
hand
all
the
time
there
was
also
a
handsome
daughter
with
a
baby
the
discarded
wife
of
a
son
of
the
next
khan
in
winter
they
said
they
amuse
themselves
by
singing
and
playing
with
their
children
and
by
making
a
few
clothes
and
the
persian
embroiders
boys
caps
aziz
khan
has
been
irrepressible
lately
his
arab
mare
is
his
idol
not
because
she
is
a
lovable
animal
and
carries
him
well
but
because
she
is
valuable
property
he
fusses
about
her
ceaselessly
and
if
he
were
allowed
would
arrange
the
marches
and
the
with
reference
solely
to
her
she
is
washed
from
her
nose
to
the
tip
of
her
tail
every
evening
clothed
and
kept
by
the
she
is
a
dainty
heartless
frivolous
creature
very
graceful
and
pretty
and
in
character
much
like
a
selfish
spoilt
woman
unfortunately
in
one
of
the
many
attempted
fights
among
the
horses
kicked
her
on
the
chest
and
a
few
days
ago
which
has
made
a
quarrel
between
hadji
owner
and
aziz
now
aziz
is
making
me
a
slave
to
his
animal
that
night
after
a
tiring
day
i
was
sleeping
soundly
when
i
was
awakened
by
aziz
saying
i
must
come
to
his
mare
or
he
would
stay
behind
with
her
the
next
day
this
is
his
daily
threat
so
i
had
to
bring
her
inside
my
tent
and
sleepily
make
a
poultice
and
bandage
the
hurt
i
have
very
little
vaseline
and
after
putting
it
twice
on
the
slight
graze
on
her
chest
which
it
cured
i
said
when
he
asked
for
it
a
third
time
that
i
must
keep
the
rest
for
men
oh
he
said
she
of
more
value
than
ten
men
lately
he
said
i
do
like
you
at
all
you
give
me
many
things
but
you
give
me
money
and
i
do
like
the
agha
he
does
give
me
half
enough
i
going
back
and
then
you
be
robbed
of
all
your
things
and
you
wish
you
had
given
them
to
me
when
i
do
anything
such
as
opening
a
whitlow
which
he
thinks
clever
he
exclaims
may
god
forgive
your
sins
this
and
may
god
forgive
the
sins
of
your
father
and
mother
are
ejaculations
of
gratitude
or
surprise
one
day
when
i
had
been
attending
to
sick
people
for
four
hours
i
asked
him
which
was
the
more
meritorious
act
attending
to
the
sick
or
going
on
pilgrimage
he
replied
for
a
no
act
is
good
but
soon
added
a
truth
god
does
think
as
we
i
do
know
yesterday
he
came
for
plaster
and
while
i
cut
it
he
saw
a
padlock
pincushion
with
a
mirror
front
on
my
bed
and
said
you
given
me
nothing
you
must
give
me
that
because
my
mare
kicked
me
but
i
like
him
he
is
a
brave
fellow
and
with
a
large
amount
of
the
mingled
simplicity
and
cunning
of
a
savage
has
a
great
deal
of
thought
information
and
ability
and
a
talk
with
him
is
worth
having
mirab
khan
had
promised
that
not
only
guides
but
his
son
would
accompany
the
agha
but
when
i
arrived
at
his
eyrie
the
next
morning
it
was
evident
that
something
was
wrong
for
the
agha
looked
gloomy
and
mirab
khan
uncomfortable
and
as
i
was
dressing
the
wound
of
the
man
the
former
said
so
far
as
i
can
see
we
are
in
a
perfect
hornets
nest
neither
son
nor
guides
were
forthcoming
it
was
necessary
to
use
very
decided
language
after
which
the
khan
professed
that
he
had
withheld
them
in
order
to
compel
us
to
be
his
guests
and
eventually
they
were
produced
i
called
again
on
the
ladies
who
received
me
in
a
sort
of
open
stable
horses
on
one
side
and
women
on
the
other
in
a
crowd
and
noise
so
overpowering
that
i
was
obliged
to
leave
them
but
not
before
i
had
been
asked
for
needles
scissors
love
philtres
etc
polygamy
besides
being
an
atrocious
system
is
very
hard
on
a
resources
i
had
brought
presents
for
four
legitimate
wives
but
not
for
the
crowd
of
women
who
asked
for
them
each
wife
wanted
to
get
her
present
unknown
to
the
others
later
they
returned
my
visit
and
were
most
importunate
in
their
requests
when
i
went
to
say
farewell
to
the
khan
i
found
him
on
his
knees
bowing
his
forehead
to
the
earth
upon
a
mecca
and
he
concluded
his
prayers
before
he
spoke
not
like
many
of
us
who
would
jump
up
ashamed
and
try
to
seem
as
if
we
never
demeaned
ourselves
by
an
act
of
devotion
his
village
diz
arjanak
has
a
diz
or
stronghold
with
a
limited
supply
of
water
it
is
the
of
his
residence
there
this
diz
consists
of
a
few
shelves
or
cavities
chiefly
artificial
scooped
out
in
the
face
of
the
perpendicular
cliff
above
the
village
they
are
only
attainable
by
a
very
difficult
climb
have
no
internal
communication
and
would
not
hold
more
than
people
in
one
cavity
there
is
a
small
perennial
spring
the
largest
recess
is
said
to
be
twelve
feet
deep
by
about
twenty
long
and
has
a
breastwork
across
the
entrance
in
case
of
attack
the
khan
and
the
people
provision
this
and
retire
to
it
believing
it
impregnable
mirab
khan
on
this
and
a
later
occasion
complained
and
apparently
with
good
reason
of
grinding
exactions
on
the
part
of
persia
the
isawands
like
the
magawes
and
zalakis
pay
their
tribute
partly
to
burujird
and
partly
to
the
ilkhani
the
sum
formerly
fixed
and
paid
was
it
was
raised
to
which
was
paid
for
two
years
now
he
says
this
year
demand
is
for
we
left
diz
arjanak
rather
late
in
the
afternoon
ascended
a
valley
which
opens
out
beyond
it
forded
the
green
bright
waters
of
the
mauri
zarin
and
crossed
beautiful
open
hillsides
and
elevated
plateaux
on
its
right
bank
till
we
lost
it
in
a
highly
picturesque
gorge
some
miles
of
very
pleasant
riding
brought
us
to
a
rocky
and
dangerous
path
along
the
side
of
a
precipice
above
the
river
badush
so
narrow
as
to
involve
the
unloading
of
several
mules
and
a
bad
slip
and
narrow
escape
on
the
part
of
mine
the
scenery
is
singularly
wild
and
severe
crossing
the
badush
and
ascending
a
narrow
ravine
through
which
it
flows
we
camped
at
its
source
at
the
junction
of
two
wild
gullies
where
the
sahib
after
sundry
serious
risks
had
already
arrived
we
did
not
see
a
single
camp
after
leaving
arjanak
and
were
quite
unmolested
during
a
halt
of
two
nights
but
it
is
an
atmosphere
of
danger
and
possible
treachery
camp
badush
at
a
height
of
feet
though
shut
in
by
high
mountains
was
cool
a
barren
rocky
treeless
spot
a
great
deal
of
bituminous
shale
was
lying
about
which
burned
in
the
fairly
well
but
with
a
black
heavy
smoke
and
a
strong
smell
the
limestone
fragments
which
lay
about
on
being
split
emitted
a
powerful
odour
of
bitumen
farther
up
the
gully
there
is
a
chalybeate
spring
and
the
broken
fragments
of
the
adjacent
rocks
are
much
stained
with
iron
after
a
restful
halt
we
retraced
our
route
by
a
low
path
which
avoided
the
difficult
precipices
above
the
badush
forded
it
several
times
crossed
a
low
pass
descended
to
the
valley
of
the
mauri
zarin
forded
the
river
and
marched
for
some
miles
along
its
left
bank
till
the
valley
opened
on
great
grassy
slopes
the
skirts
of
the
rocky
spurs
which
buttress
the
grand
mountain
shuturun
the
camel
mountain
so
called
from
its
shape
it
was
a
very
uninteresting
march
through
formless
gravelly
hills
with
their
herbage
all
eaten
down
nothing
remaining
but
tamarisk
scrub
and
a
coarse
yellow
salvia
there
were
neither
camps
nor
travellers
indeed
one
need
never
look
for
camps
where
there
is
no
herbage
this
is
a
charming
covered
with
fine
turf
damp
i
fear
and
some
of
the
men
are
down
with
fever
and
rheumatism
there
is
space
to
see
who
comes
and
who
goes
and
though
the
altitude
is
only
feet
last
night
was
quite
cool
ischaryar
aziz
devoted
young
servant
the
gentlest
and
kindest
bakhtiari
i
have
seen
became
quite
ill
of
acute
rheumatism
with
fever
and
felt
so
very
ill
and
weak
that
he
thought
he
was
going
to
die
i
sent
some
medicine
to
him
but
he
would
not
take
it
saying
that
his
master
had
spoken
unkindly
to
him
and
he
had
no
wish
to
live
however
this
morbid
frame
of
mind
was
overcome
by
firm
dealing
and
aziz
attended
to
him
all
night
and
salol
are
curing
him
he
is
the
one
grateful
creature
that
i
have
seen
among
these
orientals
and
his
gratitude
is
in
return
for
a
mere
trifle
we
were
fording
a
stream
one
hot
day
and
seeing
him
scooping
up
water
with
difficulty
in
his
hands
i
took
out
my
mug
for
him
ever
since
he
has
done
anything
that
he
can
for
me
he
brings
tasteful
little
bouquets
of
flowers
gathers
wild
cherries
and
shows
the
little
courtesies
which
spring
from
a
kindly
nature
he
said
several
times
to
mirza
it
is
only
that
the
gave
me
the
cup
but
she
took
trouble
for
me
it
may
be
imagined
what
a
desert
as
to
grateful
and
kindly
feeling
i
am
living
in
when
this
trifle
appears
like
an
oasis
hard
cunning
unblushing
greed
is
as
painful
a
characteristic
of
the
bakhtiaris
as
it
is
of
the
persians
hassan
is
now
down
with
fever
and
the
opium
craving
and
one
of
the
with
fever
the
cold
winds
of
gunak
were
too
much
for
them
all
day
shots
have
been
heard
among
the
near
mountains
the
hajwands
a
powerful
tribe
and
the
abdulwands
are
fighting
about
a
recent
cutting
off
of
a
cow
tail
but
the
actual
cause
of
the
feud
is
deeper
and
dates
farther
back
aziz
khan
wants
us
to
return
to
diz
arjanak
fearing
that
we
may
become
implicated
and
the
agha
is
calling
him
a
coward
and
telling
him
to
ride
back
alone
bang
bang
the
firing
is
now
close
and
frequent
and
the
dropping
shots
are
varied
by
straggling
volleys
with
the
glasses
i
can
see
the
tribesmen
loading
and
firing
on
the
crests
of
the
near
hills
a
great
number
are
engaged
one
tribe
has
put
up
a
stone
breastwork
at
our
end
of
the
valley
but
the
enemy
is
attacking
the
other
an
hour
ago
mirab
khan
arrived
with
a
number
of
armed
horse
and
footmen
before
he
left
he
spent
i
may
say
wasted
nearly
an
hour
of
my
time
again
on
his
maladies
and
again
wrote
down
the
directions
for
his
medicines
volleys
fired
very
near
startled
him
into
departing
and
he
rode
hastily
back
to
arjanak
fearing
as
he
said
an
attack
nominally
he
armed
the
guides
and
the
men
he
left
behind
but
one
of
the
guns
has
neither
caps
nor
powder
and
another
has
only
three
caps
all
the
animals
have
been
driven
in
a
man
with
grimy
arms
bare
to
the
elbow
has
just
run
down
to
the
agha
camp
from
the
conflict
he
says
that
his
people
who
are
greatly
inferior
to
the
hajwands
in
numbers
thought
it
was
the
camp
of
the
shah
revenue
collector
and
sent
him
to
ask
him
to
mediate
the
agha
expressed
his
willingness
to
become
a
mediator
on
certain
conditions
there
is
much
excitement
in
camp
all
the
men
who
are
well
crowding
round
this
envoy
who
is
guilty
of
saying
that
fifty
men
are
to
attack
our
camps
the
agha
with
the
sahib
and
aziz
khan
three
brave
men
mounted
and
armed
with
rifles
and
revolvers
went
to
mediate
i
went
to
a
knoll
in
the
valley
with
some
of
our
men
above
which
on
either
side
were
hills
occupied
by
the
combatants
and
a
large
number
of
tribesmen
crowned
the
crest
of
a
hill
lying
across
the
ravine
higher
up
the
firing
was
frequent
but
at
long
range
and
i
was
near
enough
to
see
that
only
one
man
fell
our
party
rode
on
till
they
reached
the
top
of
a
low
ridge
where
they
dismounted
reconnoitred
and
then
passed
out
of
sight
being
fired
on
by
both
parties
the
tribesmen
kept
on
firing
irregularly
from
the
hill
crests
occasionally
running
down
the
slopes
firing
and
running
into
cover
the
sahib
who
is
of
cheragh
ali
tribe
asked
me
is
this
the
way
they
fight
in
your
country
i
asked
him
if
he
would
not
like
to
be
fighting
and
he
replied
yes
if
it
were
my
quarrel
the
sun
was
very
bright
the
sky
very
blue
and
the
smoke
very
white
as
it
drifted
over
the
lonely
ravine
and
burst
in
clouds
from
the
i
saw
the
combatants
distinctly
without
a
glass
and
heard
their
wild
what
a
matter
for
regret
is
this
useless
tribal
fighting
with
its
dreary
consequences
of
wailing
women
and
fatherless
children
why
do
the
english
come
and
take
us
why
do
the
english
come
and
give
us
peace
are
surely
the
utterances
of
a
tired
race
after
sunset
the
agha
returned
having
so
far
succeeded
in
his
mission
that
the
headmen
have
promised
to
suspend
hostilities
for
but
still
shots
are
fired
now
and
then
footnotes
a
diz
is
a
natural
fort
believed
to
be
impregnable
to
english
people
the
bakhtiaris
profess
great
friendliness
for
england
and
the
opinion
has
been
expressed
by
some
writers
that
in
the
event
of
an
english
occupation
of
the
country
their
light
horse
drilled
by
english
officers
would
prove
valuable

inclined
however
to
believe
that
if
a

were
to
occur
in
persia
between
two
powers
which

be
nameless
the

would

lake
irene
yesterday
we
marched
through
narrow
defiles
and
along
hillsides
to
this
lake
without
seeing
a
tent
a
man
or
even
a
sheep
or
goat
following
a
stream
which
bears
several
names
and
receives
several
torrents
which
burst
full
grown
from
powerful
springs
in
the
mountain
sides
a
frequent
phenomenon
in
this
country
from
its
source
till
its
entrance
into
this
lake
its
two
sides
differ
remarkably
on
the
right
bank
rise
the
magnificent
ranges
which
form
shuturun
broken
up
into
precipices
deep
ravines
and
peaks
all
rocky
and
shapely
and
absolutely
denuded
of
soil
the
mountains
on
the
left
bank
are
great
shapeless
masses
of
bare
gravel
rising
into
the
high
but
blunt
summit
of
the
sefid

with
only
occasional
outcrops
of
rock
here
and
there
among
the

of
the
rocky
spurs

yellow
salvias
a
few
belated
campanulas
and
a
very
lovely
blue
remain
on
reaching
the
top
of
a
very
long
ascent
there
was
a
unique
surprise
for
below
walled
in
by
precipitous
mountain
sides
lies
a
lake
of
wonderful
beauty
owing
to
its
indescribable
colour
wild
fierce
and
rocky
are
the
high
mountains
in
which
this
gem
is
set
and
now
verdureless
except
that
in
some
places
where
their
steep
sides
enter
the
water
willows
and
hawthorns
find
scanty

where
the
river
enters
the

there
is
a
thicket
of
small
willows
and
where
it
leaves
it
its
bright
waters
ripple
through
a
wood
of
cherry
pear
plum
and
hawthorn
a
broad
high
bank
of
gravel
lies
across
a
part
of
its
lower
end
and
all
seemed
so
safe
and
solitary
that
i
pitched
my
camp
here
for
sunday
at
an
unusual
distance
from
the
other
camps
things
are
not
what
they
seem
two
armed
hajwands
visited
the
camps
shots
were
heard
at
intervals
this
morning
and
in
the
night
some
of
the
watch
said
they
saw
a
number
of
men
advancing
towards
us
from
under
the
bushes
i
heard
the
sharp
crack
of
our
own
rifles
twice
and
the
agha
and
sahib
calling
on
every
one
to
be
on
the
alert
the
mules
were
driven
in
and
a
great
fire
was
made
but
nothing
came
of
it
mirab
khan
guides
who
have
been
with
us
for
some
days
have
gone
back
journeying
at
night
and
hiding
in
caves
by
day
for
fear
of
being
attacked
this
lovely
lake
having
no
native
name
will
be
known
henceforward
geographically
as
lake
irene
its
waters
lie
in
depths
of
sapphire
blue
with
streaks
and
shallows
of
green
but
what
a
green
surely
without
a
rival
on
earth
were
a
pea
transparent
vivid
full
of
points
and
flashes
of
interior
light
that
would
be
the
nearest
approach
to
the
colour
which
changes
never
while
through
the
blazing
hours
the
blue
of
the
great
depths
in
the
centre
has
altered
from
sapphire
to
turquoise
and
from
turquoise
to
one
end
and
one
side
being
permanently
bordered
round
the
margin
with
liquid
emerald
the
mountains
have
changed
from
rose
to
blue
from
blue
to
gray
from
gray
to
yellow
and
are
now
flushing
into
pink
it
is
a
carnival
of
colour
before
the
dusty
browns
and
dusty
grays
which
are
to
come
sarawand
july
march
has
been
a
change
from
the
grand
scenery
of
the
bakhtiari
mountains
to
low
passes
and
gravelly
spurs
which
sink
down
upon
a
plain
a
blazing
hillside
a
mountain
of
gravel
among
others
of
similar
ugliness
sprinkled
with
camel
thorn
and
thistles
a
steep
and
long
descent
to
a
stream
ripe
wheat
on
some
irrigated
slopes
above
these
the
hundred
hovels
of
the
village
of
sarawand
clinging
one
above
another
to
the
hillside
their
white
clay
roofs
intolerable
in
the
fierce
light
more
scorched
gravel
hills
breaking
off
abruptly
and
then
a
blazing
plain
in
a
mist
of
dust
and
heat
and
low
hills
on
the
farther
side
seen
through
a
brown
haze
make
up
the
view
from
my
tent
the
plain
is
silakhor
in
persia
proper
and
that
heat
and
dust
must
shortly
be
encountered
in
the
hottest
month
of
the
year
meanwhile
the
mercury
is
at
in
the
tent
outside
is
a
noisy
crowd
of
a
mixed
race
more
persian
than
lur
row
behind
row
the
said
if
i
would
stand
outside
and
show
myself
the
people
would
be
pacified
but
the
desired
result
was
not
attained
and
the
crushing
and
pushing
were
fearful
not
that
the
people
here
or
elsewhere
are
ever
rude
it
is
simply
that
their
curiosity
is
not
restrained
by
those
rules
which
govern
ours
the
agha
tried
to
create
a
diversion
by
putting
a
large
musical
box
at
a
little
distance
but
they
did
not
care
for
it
i
attempted
to
give
each
woman
a
card
of
china
buttons
which
they
like
for
sewing
on
the
caps
of
their
children
but
the
crush
was
so
overpowering
that
i
was
obliged
to
leave
it
to
aziz
then
came
the
sick
people
with
their
many
woes
and
wants
and
though
now
at
sunset
they
have
all
gone
aziz
comes
in
every
few
minutes
with
the
laugh
of
a
lost
spirit
bringing
a
fresh
copper
bowl
for
eye
lotion
quite
pleased
to
think
of
my
annoyance
at
being
constantly
dragged
up
from
my
writing
parwez
july
we
left
early
in
the
morning
for
the
fort
of
yahya
khan
the
powerful
chief
of
the
pulawand
tribe
with
a
tall
and
very
man
bagha
khan
one
of
his
many
the
father
of
the
present
reigning
favourite
as
guide
it
was
a
very
pretty
track
pursuing
over
steep
spurs
of
parwez
and
along
the
narrow
crests
of
ridges
always
with
fine
views
on
reaching
an
alpine
valley
rich
in
flowers
we
halted
till
the
caravan
approached
and
then
rode
on
the
we
that
day
being
the
guide
on
foot
and
the
agha
the
sahib
aziz
khan
mirza
and
myself
on
horseback
in
single
file
three
men
looked
over
the
crest
of
a
ridge
to
the
left
and
disappeared
abruptly
and
i
remarked
to
mirza
that
this
was
the
most
suspicious
circumstance
we
had
yet
seen
there
was
one
man
on
the
hill
to
the
right
with
whom
the
guide
exchanged
some
sentences
in
patois
the
valley
opened
out
on
the
stony
side
of
a
hill
which
had
to
be
crossed
as
we
climbed
it
was
crested
with
a
number
of
men
with
long
guns
presently
a
number
of
shots
were
fired
at
us
and
the
reloading
of
the
guns
was
distinctly
seen
the
order
was
given
to
scatter
and
proceed
slowly
when
the
first
shot
was
fired
bagha
khan
who
must
have
been
well
known
to
all
his
tribesmen
dodged
under
a
rock
then
came
an
irregular
volley
from
a
number
of
guns
and
the
whistle
and
thud
of
bullets
over
and
among
us
showed
that
the
tribesmen
whatever
were
their
intentions
were
in
earnest
to
this
volley
the
agha
replied
by
a
rifle
shot
which
passed
close
over
their
heads
but
again
they
reloaded
rapidly
we
halted
and
aziz
khan
was
sent
up
to
parley
with
them
no
one
could
doubt
his
courage
after
that
solitary
ascent
in
the
very
face
of
the
guns
karim
cantered
up
anxious
to
fight
mujid
and
hassan
much
excited
dashed
up
and
we
rode
on
slowly
hadji
and
his
bringing
up
the
caravan
as
steadily
as
if
there
were
no
danger
ahead
not
a
man
showed
the
white
feather
though
most
like
myself
were
under
fire
for
the
first
time
when
we
reached
the
crest
of
the
pass
such
a
wild
lot
crowded
about
us
their
guns
yet
hot
from
firing
upon
us
such
queer
arms
they
had
one
gun
with
a
flint
lock
a
century
old
with
the
tower
mark
upon
it
loaded
sticks
and
long
knives
with
much
talking
and
excitement
they
accompanied
us
to
this
the
men
varied
considerably
in
their
stories
they
were
frightened
they
said
and
fired
because
they
thought
we
were
come
to
harm
them
at
first
i
was
sorry
for
them
and
regarded
them
as
merely
defending
their
hearths
and
homes
for
in
the
alpine
valley
behind
the
hill
are
their
black
tents
their
families
their
flocks
and
herds
their
world
in
fact
but
they
told
another
story
and
said
they
took
us
for
a
party
of
hajwands
this
was
untenable
and
the
agha
told
them
that
they
knew
that
hajwands
do
not
ride
on
english
saddles
and
carry
white
umbrellas
and
march
with
big
caravans
of
mules
to
me
when
they
desired
my
services
they
said
that
had
they
known
that
one
of
the
party
was
a
they
never
would
have
fired
later
from
hadji
and
others
i
have
heard
what
i
think
may
be
the
true
version
of
the
affair
they
knew
that
the
party
was
a
small
one
only
three
rifles
that
on
the
fifteen
there
were
things
which
they
specially
covet
the
value
of
which
rumour
had
doubtless
magnified
a
hundredfold
and
that
we
had
no
escort
behind
were
a
number
of
the
sarawand
men
and
the
pulawands
purposed
if
we
turned
back
or
showed
the
white
feather
in
any
way
to
double
us
up
between
the
two
parties
and
rob
the
caravan
at
discretion
the
agha
was
obliged
to
speak
very
severely
to
them
telling
them
that
firing
on
travellers
is
a
grave
offence
and
deserves
as
such
to
be
represented
to
the
governor
of
burujird
i
can
not
acquit
the
guide
of
complicity
in
this
transaction
at
this
height
of
feet
there
is
a
pleasant
plain
on
which
our
assailants
are
camped
and
our
camps
are
on
platforms
in
a
gully
near
the
top
of
parwez
it
is
all
very
destitute
of
springs
or
streams
and
we
have
only
and
that
only
during
the
hot
hours
of
the
day
for
ourselves
and
the
animals
the
tribes
among
which
we
are
now
are
powerful
and
very
predatory
in
their
habits
their
loyalty
to
the
ilkhani
is
shadowy
and
their
allegiance
to
the
shah
consists
in
the
payment
of
tribute
which
can
not
in
all
cases
be
exacted
indeed
i
think
that
both
in
tihran
and
isfahan
there
is
only
imperfect
information
as
to
the
attitude
of
the
bakhtiari
lurs
their
unification
under
the
rule
of
the
ilkhani
grows
more
and
more
incomplete
as
the
distance
from
isfahan
increases
and
these
tribes
which
are
under
the
government
of
burujird
nominally
are
practically
not
under
the
ilkhani
at
all
blood
feuds
predatory
raids
khans
at
war
with
each
other
tribal
disputes
and
hostilities
are
nearly
universal
it
is
not
for
the
interest
of
persia
to
produce
by
her
misrule
and
intrigues
such
a
chronic
state
of
insecurity
as
makes
the
tribes
desire
any
foreign
interference
which
will
give
them
security
and
rest
and
relieve
them
from
the
oppressive
exactions
of
the
persian
governors
on
a
recent
march
i
was
riding
alone
in
advance
of
the
caravan
when
i
met
two
men
one
mounted
the
other
on
foot
the
pedestrian
could
not
have
been
passed
anywhere
unnoticed
he
looked
like
a
sicilian
brigand
very
handsome
and
well
dressed
walked
with
a
long
elastic
stride
and
was
armed
with
a
gun
and
two
revolvers
he
looked
hard
at
me
with
a
jolly
but
not
unfriendly
look
and
then
seeing
the
caravan
passed
on
this
was
jiji
a
great
robber
khan
of
the
hajwand
tribe
whose
name
inspires
much
fear
afterwards
he
met
aziz
khan
and
sent
this
picturesque
message
sorry
to
have
missed
you
in
my
own
country
as
i
should
have
liked
to
have
left
you
standing
in
your
skins
i
went
up
the
with
bagha
khan
the
guide
of
whom
i
have
such
grave
suspicions
in
the
early
morning
when
the
cool
blue
shadows
were
still
lying
in
the
ravines
parwez
which
on
this
side
is
an
uninteresting
mountain
of
gravelly
slopes
falls
down
feet
to
the
holiwar
valley
on
the
other
in
a
series
of
tremendous
battlemented
precipices
of
dark
conglomerate
rock
the
level
summit
of
parwez
though
about
feet
in
altitude
is
as
uninteresting
as
the
shapeless
slopes
by
which
we
ascended
it
but
this
dip
on
the
southern
side
is
wonderful
and
is
carried
on
to
the
gap
of
bahrain
where
it
has
a
perpendicular
scarp
from
its
summit
to
the
river
of
feet
and
as
it
grandly
terminates
the
outer
range
it
looks
like
a
glorious
headland
abutting
on
the
silakhor
plain
as
a
panoramic
view
it
is
the
finest
i
have
had
from
any
mountain
taking
in
the
great
shuturun
range
the
wide
cultivated
plain
of
silakhor
with
its
many
villages
the
winding
its
yellow
crops
hardly
distinguishable
from
the
yellow
soil
and
hazy
yellow
hills
whose
many
spurs
descend
upon
the
plain
all
merged
in
a
haze
of
dust
and
heat
the
eye
is
not
tempted
to
linger
long
upon
that
specimen
of
a
persian
summer
landscape
but
turns
with
relief
to
the
other
side
of
the
ridge
to
a
confused
mass
of
mountains
of
great
height
built
up
of
precipices
of
solid
rock
dark
gray
weathered
into
black
and
denuded
of
soil
a
mystery
of
chasms
rifts
and
sheltering
and
feeding
predatory
tribes
but
unknown
to
the
rest
of
the
world
the
chaos
of
mountain
summits
chasms
and
precipices
is
very
remarkable
merging
into
lower
and
less
definite
ranges
with
alpine
meadows
at
great
heights
and
ravines
much
wooded
where
charcoal
is
burned
and
carried
to
burujird
and
hamadan
among
the
salient
points
of
this
singular
landscape
are
the
mighty
shuturun
range
the
peak
of
on
the
other
side
of
the
silakhor
plain
the
river
which
comes
down
from
lake
irene
the
holiwar
with
the
fantastic
range
of
the
seven
peaks
on
its
left
bank
descending
abruptly
to
the
beyond
which
again
rises
the
equally
precipitous
range
of
the
near
the
holiwar
valley
is
a
mountain
formed
by
a
singular
arrangement
of
rocky
buttresses
surmounted
by
a
rock
the
of
which
the
guide
told
the
legend
that
in
ancient
times
a
merchant
did
a
large
trade
in
a
tent
at
the
top
of
it
and
before
he
died
buried
his
treasure
underneath
it
a
very
striking
object
from
the
top
is
the
gorge
or
cañon
the
by
which
the
leaves
the
plain
of
silakhor
and
enters
upon
its
rough
and
fretted
passage
through
ravines
for
the
most
part
inaccessible
except
to
practised
ilyat
mountaineers
had
i
come
up
to
dig
for
the
hidden
treasure
of
the
guide
asked
was
i
seeking
gold
or
was
i
searching
for
medicine
plants
to
sell
in
feringhistan
the
three
days
here
have
been
rather
lively
the
information
concerning
routes
has
been
singularly
contradictory
there
is
a
path
which
descends
over
feet
to
the
holiwar
valley
through
which
for
certain
reasons
it
is
desirable
to
pass
some
say
it
is
absolutely
impassable
for
laden
mules
others
that
it
can
be
traversed
with
precautions
others
again
that
they
would
not
take
even
their
asses
down
that
there
are
shelving
rocks
and
that
if
a
mule
slipped
it
would
go
down
to
hadji
with
much
force
urges
that
we
should
descend
to
the
plain
and
go
by
a
comparatively
safe
route
to
khuramabad
leave
the
heavy
baggage
there
and
get
a
strong
escort
of
from
the
governor
for
the
country
of
the
pulawands
there
is
much
that
is
plausible
in
this
plan
the
sahib
approves
of
it
and
the
agha
with
whom
the
decision
rests
has
taken
it
into
very
careful
consideration
but
i
am
thoroughly
averse
to
it
though
i
say
nothing
hadji
says
he
can
not
risk
his
mules
on
the
path
down
to
the
holiwar
valley
i
could
have
filled
pages
with
the
difficulties
which
have
been
grappled
with
during
the
last
few
weeks
of
the
journey
as
to
guides
routes
perils
two
or
three
hours
of
every
day
being
occupied
in
the
attempt
to
elicit
truth
from
men
who
from
either
inherent
vagueness
and
inaccuracy
or
from
a
deliberate
intention
to
deceive
contradict
both
themselves
and
each
other
but
on
this
occasion
the
difficulties
have
been
greater
than
ever
the
order
of
march
has
been
changed
five
times
and
we
have
been
obliged
to
remain
here
because
the
agha
has
not
considered
that
the
information
he
has
obtained
has
warranted
him
in
coming
to
a
decision
yesterday
evening
the
balance
of
opinion
was
definitely
against
the
holiwar
route
and
hadji
was
so
vehemently
against
it
that
he
shook
a
man
who
said
it
was
passable
this
morning
the
sahib
with
a
guide
and
abbas
ali
examined
the
road
the
sahib
thought
it
was
passable
abbas
ali
said
that
the
mules
would
slip
off
the
shelving
rocks
all
day
long
there
have
been
lur
visitors
some
saying
one
thing
and
some
another
but
a
dream
last
night
reconciled
hadji
to
take
the
route
and
the
agha
after
carefully
weighing
the
risks
all
round
has
decided
upon
it
all
these
pros
and
cons
have
been
very
interesting
and
there
have
been
various
little
incidents
i
have
had
many
visitors
and
patients
from
the
neighbouring
camp
and
among
them
three
of
the
men
who
fired
upon
us
the
trifle
of
greatest
magnitude
was
the
illness
of
aziz
mare
the
result
of
a
kick
from
she
had
an
enormous
swelling
from
knee
to
shoulder
could
not
sleep
and
could
hardly
eat
and
as
she
belongs
partly
to
isfandyar
khan
aziz
khan
has
been
distracted
about
her
and
has
distracted
me
by
constant
appeals
to
me
to
open
what
seemed
an
abscess
i
had
not
the
courage
for
this
but
it
was
done
and
the
cut
bled
so
profusely
that
a
pad
a
stone
and
a
bandage
had
to
be
applied
unfortunately
there
was
no
relief
from
this
venture
and
aziz
worrited
me
out
of
my
tent
three
times
in
the
night
to
look
at
the
creature
besides
that
he
had
about
twenty
ailing
people
outside
the
tent
at
always
sending
to
me
to
come
at
once
he
was
told
to
wash
the
wound
but
he
would
do
nothing
till
i
went
out
with
my
appliances
very
grudgingly
i
admit
the
sweet
animal
was
indeed
suffering
and
the
swelling
was
much
increased
a
number
of
men
were
standing
round
her
and
when
i
told
aziz
to
remove
the
clot
from
the
wound
they
insisted
that
she
would
bleed
to
death
and
so
the
pros
and
cons
went
on
till
aziz
said
the
shall
do
it
these
feringhi
know
everything
to
be
regarded
as
a
on
the
slenderest
possible
foundation
is
distressing
but
to
be
regarded
as
a
vet
without
any
foundation
at
all
is
far
worse
however
the
clot
was
removed
and
though
the
wound
was
three
inches
long
there
was
still
no
relief
and
aziz
said
solemnly
now
do
what
you
think
best
very
gradual
pressure
at
the
back
of
the
leg
brought
out
a
black
solid
mass
weighing
fully
a
pound
god
is
great
exclaimed
the
bystanders
may
god
forgive
your
sins
cried
aziz
and
fell
at
my
feet
with
a
genuine
impulse
of
gratitude
he
insists
that
a
pound
of
flesh
came
out
of
the
swelling
the
wound
is
now
syringed
every
few
hours
and
aziz
is
learning
how
to
do
this
and
to
dress
it
the
mare
can
both
eat
and
sleep
and
will
soon
be
well
this
evening
aziz
said
that
fifteen
would
be
the
charge
for
curing
his
mare
and
that
he
says
is
my
present
to
him
he
told
me
he
wanted
me
to
consider
something
very
thoroughly
and
not
to
answer
hastily
he
said
we
a
poor
people
we
have
no
money
but
we
have
plenty
of
food
we
have
women
who
take
out
bullets
but
in
all
our
nation
there
is
no
who
knows
the
wisdom
of
the
feringhis
your
medicines
are
good
and
have
healed
many
of
our
people
and
though
a
we
like
you
well
and
will
do
your
bidding
the
agha
speaks
of
sending
a
among
us
next
year
but
you
are
here
and
though
you
are
old
you
can
ride
and
eat
our
food
and
you
love
our
people
you
have
your
tent
isfandyar
khan
will
give
you
a
horse
of
pure
pedigree
dwell
among
us
till
you
are
very
old
and
be
our
and
teach
us
the
wisdom
of
the
feringhis
then
as
if
a
sudden
thought
had
struck
him
he
added
and
you
can
cure
mules
and
mares
and
get
much
money
and
when
you
go
back
to
feringhistan
be
very
rich
in
nearly
every
camp
i
have
an
evening
gossip
with
the
guides
and
others
of
the
tribesmen
and
in
the
absence
of
news
from
the
larger
world
have
become
intensely
interested
in
bakhtiari
life
as
it
is
pictured
for
me
in
their
simple
narratives
of
recent
forays
of
growing
tribal
feuds
and
their
causes
of
blood
feuds
and
of
bloody
fights
arising
out
of
trivial
disputes
regarding
right
of
pasture
right
to
a
wounded
bird
and
things
more
trivial
still
they
are
savages
at
heart
they
take
a
pride
in
bloodshed
though
they
say
they
are
tired
of
it
and
would
like
to
live
at
peace
and
there
would
be
more
killing
than
there
is
were
it
not
for
the
aversion
which
some
of
them
feel
to
the
creation
of
a
blood
feud
when
they
do
fight
the
life
of
a
man
is
as
the
life
of
a
sheep
as
the
persian
proverb
runs
mirza
says
that
among
themselves
their
talk
is
chiefly
of
guns
and
fighting
the
affairs
of
the
mountains
are
very
interesting
and
so
is
the
keen
antagonism
between
the
adherents
of
the
ilkani
and
those
of
isfandyar
khan
sometimes
the
conversation
takes
a
religious
turn
i
think
i
wronged
aziz
khan
in
an
earlier
letter
he
is
in
his
way
much
more
religious
than
i
thought
him
a
day
or
two
ago
i
was
asking
him
his
beliefs
regarding
a
future
state
which
he
explained
at
much
length
and
which
involve
progressive
beatitudes
of
the
spirit
through
a
course
of
one
hundred
years
he
laid
down
times
and
seasons
very
definitely
and
was
obviously
in
earnest
when
two
magawe
men
who
were
standing
by
broke
in
indignantly
saying
aziz
khan
how
dare
you
speak
thus
these
things
belong
to
god
the
judge
he
knows
we
do
we
see
the
spirit
fly
away
to
judgment
and
we
know
no
more
god
is
great
he
alone
knows
apparently
they
have
no
idea
generally
of
a
future
except
that
the
spirit
goes
either
to
heaven
or
hell
according
to
its
works
in
the
flesh
some
say
that
they
are
told
that
there
is
an
intermediate
place
called
known
as
the
place
of
evil
spirits
in
which
those
who
have
died
in
sin
undergo
a
probation
with
the
possibility
of
beneficent
results
on
asking
what
is
meant
by
sin
the
replies
all
have
the
same
tendency
cowardice
breaches
of
the
seventh
commandment
which
however
seem
to
be
so
rare
as
scarcely
to
be
taken
into
account
possibly
because
of
the
death
penalty
attaching
to
them
disobedience
to
a
chief
when
he
calls
on
them
to
go
to
war
fraternising
with
sunnis
who
are
accursed
betraying
to
an
enemy
a
man
of
their
own
tribe
and
compassing
the
death
of
another
by
poison
or
evil
machinations
on
being
asked
what
deeds
are
good
bravery
is
put
first
readiness
to
take
up
a
tribal
quarrel
charity
kindness
to
the
poor
undying
hatred
to
the
caliph
omar
shown
by
ostracising
the
sunnis
hatred
of
and
pilgrimages
especially
to
mecca
death
in
battle
ensures
an
immediate
entrance
into
heaven
and
this
is
regarded
as
such
a
cause
of
rejoicing
that
not
only
is
the
or
national
dance
performed
at
a
fighting
man
grave
but
if
his
death
at
a
distance
has
been
lawful
if
he
has
been
killed
in
fighting
they
put
up
a
rude
temporary
cenotaph
with
his
gun
cap
knife
pipe
and
other
things
about
it
and
dance
sing
and
rejoice
otherwise
their
burial
rites
are
simple
the
corpse
is
washed
seven
times
in
water
certain
arabic
formulas
for
the
repose
of
the
soul
are
recited
and
the
body
clothed
and
wrapped
in
a
is
carried
by
four
men
to
the
on
a
bier
extemporised
out
of
and
is
buried
in
a
shallow
grave
it
is
not
customary
now
to
rejoice
at
the
graves
of
women
or
old
men
unless
the
latter
have
been
distinguished
warriors
so
far
as
i
can
learn
even
in
the
case
of
the
deaths
of
fighting
men
when
the
is
danced
at
the
grave
the
women
keep
up
the
ordinary
ceremonial
of
mourning
which
is
very
striking
they
howl
and
wail
beating
their
breasts
rhythmically
keeping
time
with
their
feet
tearing
their
hair
and
gashing
their
faces
with
sharp
flints
cutting
off
also
their
long
locks
and
trampling
upon
them
with
piteous
cries
this
last
bitter
token
of
mourning
is
confined
to
the
deaths
of
a
husband
and
a
son
and
the
locks
so
ruthlessly
treated
are
afterwards
attached
to
the
tombstone
mourning
for
a
husband
child
or
parent
lasts
a
year
and
the
anniversary
of
the
death
is
kept
with
the
same
ceremonies
which
marked
the
beginning
of
the
period
of
mourning
in
the
case
of
a
great
man
who
has
died
fighting
the
women
of
his
tribe
wail
and
beat
their
breasts
on
this
anniversary
for
many
subsequent
years
nothing
is
buried
with
the
corpse
and
nothing
is
placed
on
the
grave
but
it
is
the
universal
custom
to
put
a
stone
at
the
head
of
the
body
which
is
always
buried
facing
to
this
position
they
attach
great
importance
and
they
covet
my
compass
because
it
would
enable
them
at
any
point
to
find
the
position
of
the
kiblah
a
comb
or
distaff
rudely
carved
on
a
woman
headstone
and
the
implements
of
war
or
hunting
on
that
of
a
man
are
common
and
few
are
without
one
or
more
of
the
uncouth
stone
lions
to
which
frequent
reference
has
been
made
the
graveyards
are
very
numerous
and
are
usually
on
small
elevations
by
the
roadside
so
that
if
they
be
hadjis
may
pray
for
the
repose
of
the
soul
it
must
be
understood
that
prayer
consists
in
the
repetition
of
certain
formulas
in
arabic
which
very
few
if
any
of
these
people
understand
as
to
the
great
matter
of
their
religion
on
which
i
have
taken
infinite
trouble
to
gain
information
i
can
come
to
no
satisfactory
conclusion
i
think
that
they
have
very
little
and
that
what
they
have
consists
in
a
fusion
of
some
of
the
tenets
of
islam
with
a
few
relics
of
a
nature
worship
not
less
rude
than
that
of
the
ainos
of
yezo
and
other
aboriginal
tribes
they
are
shiahs
that
is
they
hate
the
sunnis
and
though
the
belief
in
persia
that
they
compel
any
one
entering
their
country
to
swear
eternal
hatred
to
omar
is
not
absolutely
correct
this
hate
is
an
essential
part
of
their
religion
they
hold
the
unity
of
god
and
that
mohammed
was
his
prophet
but
practically
though
they
are
not
ali
ilahis
they
place
ali
on
as
high
a
pedestal
as
mohammed
they
are
utterly
lax
in
observing
the
precepts
of
the
koran
even
prayer
at
the
canonical
hours
is
very
rarely
practised
and
then
chiefly
by
seyyids
and
hadjis
it
has
been
said
that
the
women
are
devout
but
i
think
that
this
is
a
mistake
many
of
them
have
said
to
me
women
have
no
religion
for
women
wo
live
again
those
of
the
khans
who
can
read
and
who
have
made
pilgrimages
to
mecca
such
as
the
hadji
ilkhani
khaja
taimur
and
mirab
khan
observe
the
times
of
prayer
and
read
the
koran
and
when
they
are
so
engaged
they
allow
of
no
interruption
but
these
are
remarkable
exceptions
pilgrimages
and
visits
to
are
lightly
undertaken
either
for
the
accumulation
of
merit
or
to
wash
away
the
few
misdeeds
which
they
regard
as
sin
or
in
the
hope
of
gaining
an
advantage
over
an
enemy
they
regard
certain
stones
trees
and
springs
as
sacred
but
it
is
difficult
to
define
the
very
vague
ideas
which
they
attach
to
them
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
they
look
on
them
as
the
abodes
of
genii
always
malignant
and
requiring
to
be
propitiated
in
passing
such
places
they
use
a
formula
equivalent
to
may
god
avert
evil
and
it
is
common
as
in
nubra
and
ladak
to
hang
pieces
of
rag
on
such
trees
and
stones
as
offerings
to
the
they
regard
certain
places
as
possibly
haunted
by
spirits
always
evil
and
never
those
of
the
departed
but
this
can
scarcely
be
termed
a
belief
as
it
is
lightly
held
and
quite
uninfluential
except
in
preventing
them
from
passing
such
places
alone
in
the
darkness
the
opinions
concerning
god
represent
him
chiefly
as
a
personification
of
a
fate
to
which
they
must
bow
and
as
a
judge
to
whom
in
some
mysterious
way
they
must
account
after
death
earthly
justice
appears
to
them
as
a
commodity
to
be
bought
and
sold
as
among
the
persians
or
as
it
is
among
themselves
as
severity
solely
without
a
sentiment
of
mercy
and
i
have
asked
them
often
if
they
think
that
anything
will
be
able
to
affect
the
judgment
of
the
judge
of
all
in
case
it
should
go
against
them
usually
they
reply
in
the
negative
but
a
few
say
that
ali
the
lieutenant
of
god
will
ask
for
mercy
for
them
and
that
he
will
not
be
refused
of
god
as
a
moral
being
i
think
they
have
little
conception
and
less
of
the
creator
as
an
object
of
love
of
holiness
as
an
attribute
of
god
they
have
no
idea
their
ejaculation
god
is
good
has
really
no
meaning
charity
under
the
term
goodness
they
attribute
to
god
but
they
have
no
notion
of
moral
requirements
on
the
part
of
the
creator
or
of
sin
as
the
breaking
of
any
laws
which
he
has
laid
down
they
concern
themselves
about
the
requirements
of
religion
in
this
life
and
about
the
future
of
the
soul
as
little
as
is
possible
and
they
narrow
salvation
within
the
limits
of
the
shiah
sect
after
mohammed
and
ali
they
speak
of
moses
abraham
and
jesus
as
prophets
but
of
moses
as
a
lawgiver
and
of
jesus
as
aught
else
but
a
healer
they
seem
quite
ignorant
and
so
they
pass
away
generation
after
generation
ignorant
of
the
fatherhood
of
god
and
the
brotherhood
of
man
of
the
love
to
god
and
man
which
is
alone
the
fulfilling
of
the
law
and
of
the
light
which
he
who
is
the
resurrection
and
the
life
has
shed
upon
the
destiny
of
the
human
spirit
generally
i
find
them
quite
willing
to
talk
on
these
subjects
but
one
man
said
contemptuously
what
has
a
to
do
with
god
the
women
know
nothing
and
except
among
the
sons
of
the
leading
khans
there
is
no
instruction
in
the
koran
given
to
the
children
if
i
have
interpreted
their
views
correctly
they
must
be
among
the
most
ignorant
of
the
races
bound
by
the
faith
of
islam
august
leaving
the
camp
on
parwez
and
skirting
the
gravelly
slopes
on
the
north
side
of
its
ridge
a
sudden
dip
over
the
crest
took
us
among
great
cliffs
of
conglomerate
with
steep
gravelly
slopes
below
much
covered
with
oaks
growing
out
of
scorched
soil
grooves
slides
broken
ledges
and
shelving
faces
of
rock
have
to
be
descended
one
part
is
awfully
bad
and
every
available
man
and
some
passing
bakhtiaris
who
wanted
to
be
paid
in
advance
for
their
services
went
back
to
help
the
animals
the
shouted
and
yelled
and
the
horses
and
some
of
the
mules
were
taken
by
their
heads
and
tails
but
though
nearly
every
man
had
a
fall
horses
asses
mules
and
a
sheep
which
follows
got
over
that
part
safely
it
was
a
fine
sight
thirty
animals
coming
down
what
looked
from
below
a
precipice
led
by
hadji
leading
cock
o
the
walk
shaking
his
tasselled
head
and
as
full
of
pride
and
fire
as
usual
and
the
mules
looking
wisely
choosing
their
way
and
leaping
dexterously
upon
and
among
the
rocks
it
is
not
a
route
for
laden
animals
but
personally
as
i
had
two
men
to
help
me
i
did
not
find
it
so
risky
or
severe
as
the
descent
of
the
gokun
pass
below
these
conglomerate
precipices
are
steep
and
dangerous
zigzags
which
i
was
obliged
to
ride
down
and
there
we
were
not
so
fortunate
for
hadji
big
slipped
and
being
unable
to
recover
herself
fell
over
the
edge
some
hundred
feet
and
was
killed
instantaneously
the
descent
of
the
southern
face
of
parwez
abrupt
and
dangerous
most
of
the
way
is
over
feet
the
track
proceeds
down
the
holiwar
valley
brightened
by
a
river
of
clear
green
water
descending
from
lake
irene
having
forded
this
we
camped
on
its
left
bank
on
a
gravelly
platform
at
the
edge
of
the
oak
woods
which
clothe
the
lower
spurs
of
the
grand
with
a
magnificent
view
of
the
gray
battlemented
precipices
of
parwez
the
valley
is
beautiful
and
acres
of
withered
flowers
suggested
what
its
brief
spring
loveliness
must
be
but
its
altitude
is
only
feet
and
the
mercury
in
the
shade
was
the
radiation
from
the
rock
and
gravel
terrible
and
the
made
rest
impossible
at
midnight
the
mercury
stood
at
there
were
no
bakhtiaris
but
two
or
three
patches
of
wheat
not
worth
cutting
evidenced
their
occasional
presence
among
these
perished
crops
revelling
in
blazing
soil
and
air
like
the
breath
of
a
furnace
grew
the
blue
and
the
scarlet
poppy
the
attendants
upon
grain
and
where
other
things
were
burned
the
familiar
sweet
william
a
and
a
gigantic
yellow
mullein
audaciously
braved
the
heat
no
one
slept
that
night
because
of
the
and
the
need
for
keeping
a
vigilant
watch
indeed
the
tents
were
packed
shortly
after
sunset
and
in
a
hot
dawn
we
ascended
to
a
considerable
height
above
the
valley
and
then
for
many
miles
followed
a
stream
in
a
wooded
glen
where
willows

us
into

opened
out
into

surrounded
by

khanabad
the

dwelling
of
yahya
khan
with
terraces
of
poplars
mulberries
pomegranates
and
apricots
below
it
makes
a
good
centre
of
a
rather
pretty
view
leaving
it
on
the
right
we
turned
up
a
narrow
valley
with
a
small
stream
and
irrigation
channels
and
close
to
a
spring
and
some
magnificent
plane
trees
camped
for
sunday
on
a
level
piece
of
blazing
ground
where
the
mercury
stood
at
on
both
days
this
spot
was
remarkable
for
some
very
fine
growing
by
the
stream
with
blossoms
of
a
beautiful
french
blue
the
size
of
a
seville
orange
the
khan
son
a
most
unprepossessing
young
man
called
on
me
and
i
received
him
under
the
trees
a
number
of
retainers
armed
with
long
guns
standing
round
the
edge
of
the
carpet
he
was
well
dressed
but
a
savage
in
speech
and
deportment
as
to
the
dress
of
the
bakhtiaris
the
ordinary
tribesmen
wear
coarse
cotton
shirts
fastening
at
the
side
but
generally
unfastened
blue
cotton
trousers
each
leg
two
yards
wide
loose
at
the
bottom
and
drawn
on
a
string
at
the
top
webbing
shoes
worsted
socks
if
any
woollen
girdles
with
a
kashmir
pattern
and
huge
loose
brown
felt
coats
or
cloaks
with
long
sleeves
costing
from
fifteen
to
each
and
wearing
for
three
or
four
years
the
khans
frequently
have
their
of
black
silk
and
wear
the
ordinary
persian
coat
usually
black
but
for
best
one
of
fine
blue
or
fawn
cloth
all
wear
brown
or
white
felt
and
shave
their
heads
for
a
width
of
five
inches
from
the
brow
to
the
nape
of
the
neck
leaving
long
the
girdle
supplies
the
place
of
pockets
and
in
it
are
deposited
knives
the
pipe
the
the
flint
and
steel
and
various
etceteras
every
man
carries
a
long
gun
slung
from
his
left
shoulder
or
a
stout
shillelagh
or
a
stick
split
and
loaded
at
one
end
the
split
being
secured
with
strong
leather
or
all
these
weapons
of
offence
and
defence
at
once
these
very
wide
much
like
the
divided
garment
are
not
convenient
in
rough
walking
and
on
the
march
a
piece
of
the
hem
on
the
outer
side
is
tucked
into
the
girdle
producing
at
once
the
neat
effect
of
knickerbockers
the
men
are
very
well
made
i
have
never
seen
deformity
or
lameness
except
from
bullet
wounds
they
are
not
usually
above
the
middle
height
though
that
is
exceeded
by
the
men
of
the
zalaki
tribe
they
are
darker
than
the
persians
as
a
general
rule
they
have
straight
noses
with
very
fully
expanded
nostrils
good
mouths
thin
lips
straight
or
slightly
curved
eyebrows
dark
gray
or
black
eyes
hazel
in
a
few
instances
deeply
set
and
usually
rather
close
together
foreheads
small
ears
very
small
feet
and
small
hands
with
tapering
fingers
the
limbs
below
the
knee
are
remarkably
straight
and
and
the
walk
is
always
good
it
is
not
easy
to
say
how
the
women
are
made
as
their
clothing
gives
no
indications
of
form
they
are
and
walk
with
a
firm
even
elastic
stride
they
are
frequently
tall
and
except
when
secluded
are
rarely
stout
their
hands
and
feet
are
small
their
figures
are
spoilt
if
they
ever
had
any
by
early
maternity
and
hard
work
at
twenty
a
woman
looks
past
forty
many
perhaps
it
is
not
an
exaggeration
to
say
most
of
them
have
narrowly
escaped
being
handsome
fine
eyes
straight
noses
and
mouths
with
thin
lips
are
the
rule
the
hair
is
always
glossy
and
abundant
and
the
teeth
of
both
sexes
are
white
regular
and
though
toothache
is
a
painfully
common
ailment
the
women
dress
in
the
higher
classes
is
much
like
that
worn
by
the
ordinary
persian
women
with
the
exception
of
what
i
have
elsewhere
called
balloon
trousers
but
the
wives
are
clothed
in
loose
blue
cotton
trousers
drawn
in
at
the
ankles
short
open
chemises
and
short
open
jackets
a
black
or
coloured
kerchief
covers
the
head
the
ends
hanging
down
behind
or
in
front
they
wear
loose
woollen
shoes
with
leather
soles
the
dress
is
not
pretty
or
picturesque
and
is
apt
to
be
dirty
and
ragged
but
it
suits
their
lives
and
their
hard
work
both
sexes
stain
the
and
the
palms
of
the
hands
with
henna
and
all
wear
amulets
or
charms
suspended
round
the
neck
or
bound
on
the
upper
part
of
the
arm
these
consist
of
passages
from
the
koran
which
are
written
on
parchment
in
very
small
characters
and
are
enclosed
in
cases
of
silver
or
leather
at
night
they
merely
take
off
the
outer
garment
where
they
have
two
the
scanty
ablutions
are
very
curious
each
family
possesses
a
metal
jug
of
rather
graceful
form
with
a
long
spout
curiously
curved
and
the
mode
of
washing
which
points
to
an
accustomed
scarcity
of
water
is
to
pour
a
little
into
the
palm
of
the
right
hand
and
bathe
the
face
arms
and
hands
with
it
soap
not
being
used
they
conclude
by
rinsing
the
mouth
and
rubbing
the
teeth
either
with
the
forefinger
or
with
the
aromatic
leaf
of
a
small
pink
salvia
i
called
by
appointment
on
the
khan
wives
sixteen
in
number
an
ordinary
tribesman
marries
as
many
wives
as
he
can
afford
to
house
and
keep
poverty
and
monogamy
are
not
allied
here
women
do
nearly
all
the
work
large
flocks
create
much
female
employment
and
as
it
is
contrary
to
bakhtiari
custom
to
employ
female
servants
who
are
not
wives
polygamy
is
very
largely
practised
on
questioning
the
guides
who
are
usually
very
poor
men
i
find
that
they
have
two
three
and
even
four
wives
the
reverse
of
what
is
customary
among
the
peasants
of
turkey
and
persia
proper
the
influence
of
a
chief
increases
with
the
number
of
his
wives
as
it
enlarges
his
own
family
connections
and
those
made
by
the
marriages
of
his
many
sons
and
daughters
large
families
are
the
rule
six
children
is
the
average
in
a
monogamous
household
and
the
rate
of
infant
mortality
is
very
low
the
fort
is
really
picturesque
though
forlorn
and
dirty
it
is
built
on
the
steep
slope
of
a
hill
and
on
one
side
is
three
stories
in
height
it
has
a
long
gallery
in
front
with
fretwork
above
the
posts
which
support
the
roof
round
towers
at
two
of
the
corners
and
many
irregular
roofs
and
steep
zigzags
cut
in
the
rock
lead
up
to
it
the
centre
is
a
quadrangle
when
i
reached
the
gateway
under
the
tower
many
women
welcomed
me
and
led
me
down
a
darkish
passage
to
the
gallery
aforesaid
which
has
a
pretty
view
of
low
hills
with
mulberries
and
pomegranates
in
the
foreground
this
gallery
runs
the
whole
length
of
the
fort
and
good
rooms
open
upon
it
it
was
furnished
with
rugs
upon
the
floor
and
two
long
wooden
settees
covered
with
checked
native
blankets
in
squares
of
indian
yellow
and
madder
red
i
had
presents
for
the
favourite
wife
but
as
one
man
said
this
was
the
favourite
and
another
that
and
the
hungry
eyes
of
sixteen
women
were
fixed
on
the
parcels
i
took
the
safer
course
of
presenting
them
to
the
khan
for
the
ladies
of
the
yahya
khan
sent
to
know
if
it
would
be
agreeable
to
me
for
him
to
make
his
salaam
to
me
a
proposal
which
i
gladly
accepted
as
a
relief
from
the
curiosity
and
disagreeable
familiarity
of
the
women
there
was
a
complete
rabble
of
women
in
the
gallery
with
crawling
children
and
screaming
babies
a
forlorn
disorderly
household
in
which
the
component
parts
made
no
secret
of
their
hatred
and
jealousy
of
each
other
i
pitied
the
khan
as
he
came
in
to
this
babel
of
intriguing
women
and
untutored
children
of
women
without
womanliness
and
children
without
innocence
the
lord
and
master
of
the
women
but
not
in
any
noble
sense
their
husband
nor
is
the
house
or
any
polygamous
house
in
any
sense
a
home
the
wife
who
i
was
afterwards
told
is
the
reigning
favourite
sat
on
the
same
settee
as
her
lord
and
he
ignored
the
whole
of
them
her
father
bagha
khan
asked
me
to
give
into
his
care
the
present
for
her
lest
it
should
make
the
other
wives
jealous
yahya
khan
rules
a
large
part
of
the
pulawand
tribe
families
and
aspires
to
the
chieftainship
of
its
subdivisions
among
which
are
the
bosakis
hajwands

and
hebidis
numbering
families
illustration
yahya
khan
he
is
a
tall
big
man
with
a
very
wide
mouth
and
a
beard
dyed
auburn
with
henna
very
intelligent
especially
as
regards
his
own
interests
and
very
well
off
having
built
his
castle
himself
he
asked
me
if
i
thought
england
would
occupy
persia
in
the
present
shah
lifetime
which
has
the
stronger
army
england
or
russia
why
england
does
not
take
afghanistan
did
i
think
the
had
any
chance
of
succeeding
his
father
but
several
times
reverted
to
what
seemed
uppermost
in
his
mind
the
chances
of
a
british
occupation
of
southern
persia
a
subject
on
which
i
was
unwilling
to
enter
he
complained
bitterly
of
persian
exactions
and
said
that
the
demand
made
on
him
this
year
is
exactly
double
the
sum
fixed
by
the
it
is
not
easy
to
estimate
the
legitimate
taxation
probably
it
averages
two
or
nearly
fifteen
shillings
a
family
the
assessment
of
the
tribes
is
fixed
but
twenty
forty
and
even
sixty
per
cent
extra
is
often
taken
from
them
by
the
authorities
who
in
their
turn
are
squeezed
at
tihran
or
isfahan
every
cow
mule
ass
sheep
and
goat
is
taxed
horses
pay
nothing
in
order
to
get
away
from
perilous
topics
which
had
absolutely
no
interest
for
the
women
i
told
him
how
interested
i
was
in
seeing
all
his
people
clothed
in
blue
manchester
cottons
though
england
does
not
grow
a
tuft
of
cotton
or
a
plant
of
indigo
i
mentioned
that
the
number
of
people
dependent
on
the
cotton
industry
in
britain
equals
the
whole
population
of
persia
and
this
made
such
an
impression
on
him
that
he
asked
me
to
repeat
it
three
times
he
described
his
tribe
as
prosperous
raising
more
wheat
than
it
requires
and
exporting
worth
of
carpets
annually
it
is
curious
that
nomadic
should
not
only
sow
and
harvest
crops
and
make
carpets
of
dyed
wool
as
well
as
rugs
and
cloth
and
socks
of
intricate
patterns
but
that
they
should
understand
the
advantages
of
trade
and
export
not
only
mules
colts
and
sheep
but
large
quantities
of
charcoal
which
is
carried
as
far
as
hamadan
as
well
as
tobacco
opium
rice
gum
mastic
clarified
butter
the
skins
of
the
fox
and
a
kind
of
marten
and
cherry
sticks
for
pipes
certainly
the
women
are
very
industrious
rising
at
daylight
to
churn
working
all
day
weaving
in
the
intervals
and
late
at
night
boiling
the
butter
in
their
big
caldrons
they
make
their
own
clothes
and
those
of
their
husbands
and
children
except
the
felt
coats
sewing
with
needles
like
skewers
and
very
coarse
cotton
thread
they
sew
backwards
from
left
to
right
and
seem
to
use
none
but
a
running
stitch
everywhere
they
have
been
delighted
with
gifts
of
english
needles
and
thread
steel
thimbles
and
scissors
when
it
is
remembered
that
in
addition
to
all
the
household
avocations
which
i
have
enumerated
they
pitch
and
strike
tents
do
much
of
the
loading
and
unloading
of
the
baggage
and
attend
faithfully
to
their
own
offspring
and
to
that
of
their
flocks
and
herds
it
will
be
realised
that
the
life
of
a
bakhtiari
wife
is
sufficiently
laborious
we
were
to
have
left
that
burning
valley
at
and
when
i
returned
at
dusk
from
the
fort
the
tents
were
folded
and
the
loads
ready
for
a
moonlight
march
but
yahya
khan
sent
to
say
that
for
the
ostensible
reason
of
the
path
being
greatly
obstructed
by
trees
we
could
not
start
till
daylight
later
he
came
with
a
number
of
tribesmen
and
haggled
noisily
for
two
hours
about
the
payment
of
an
escort
and
the
sheep
a
day
which
it
would
require
it
was
not
a
comfortable
night
for
the
were
legion
and
we
did
not
get
off
till
when
we
were
joined
by
yahya
khan
and
his
son
who
accompanied
us
to
the
the
path
from
kalla
khanabad
runs
at
a
considerable
elevation
on
wooded
hillsides
and
slopes
of
shelving
rock
only
descending
to
cross
some
curious
ribs
of
conglomerate
and
the
streams
which
flow
into
the
there
are
frequent
glimpses
of
the
river
which
has
the
exquisite
green
colour
noticeable
in
nearly
all
the
streams
of
this
part
of
luristan
at
a
distance
of
a
few
miles
from
khanabad
the
valley
which
has
been
pretty
wide
and
allows
the
river
to
expand
into
smooth
green
reaches
narrows
suddenly
and
the
a
full
strong
stream
falls
in
a
very
fine
waterfall
over
a
natural
dam
or
ledge
of
rock
which
crosses
it
at
its
broadest
part
and
is
then
suddenly
compressed
into
a
narrow
passage
between
cliffs
and
ledges
of
bituminous
limestone
the
lowest
of
which
is
a
continuation
of
the
path
which
descends
upon
it
by
some
steep
zigzags
below
this
gorge
the
river
opens
out
into
a
smooth
green
stretch
where
it
reposes
briefly
before
starting
on
a
wild
and
fretted
course
through
deep
chasms
among
precipitous
mountains
till
it
emerges
on
the
plains
above
dizful
these
limestone
cliffs
exude
much
bitumen
and
there
is
a
bituminous
spring
our
men
took
the
opportunity
of
collecting
the
bitumen
and
rolling
it
into
balls
for
future
use
as
it
is
esteemed
a
good
remedy
for
dyspepsia
and
bad
blood
at
the
narrowest
part
of
its
channel
the
river
is
crossed
by
a
twig
bridge
wide
enough
for
laden
animals
supported
on
the
left
bank
by
some
kept
steady
by
a
mass
of
stones
in
the
middle
it
takes
a
steepish
upward
turn
and
hangs
on
to
the
opposite
cliff
at
a
considerable
elevation
the
path
up
from
it
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
is
very
narrow
and
zigzags
by
broken
ledges
between
walls
of
rock
for
loaded
animals
it
is
a
very
bad
place
and
the
caravan
took
an
hour
and
a
half
to
cross
though
only
four
mules
were
unloaded
the
rest
being
helped
across
by
men
at
their
heads
and
tails
several
of
them
fell
on
the
difficult
climb
from
the
bridge
it
would
be
bad
enough
if
the
roadway
of
osiers
were
level
but
it
shelves
slightly
to
the
south
that
gorge
is
a
very
interesting
break
in
an
uninteresting
and
monotonous
region
and
the
broad
fall
above
the
bridge
is
not
without
elements
of
grandeur
the
altitude
of
the
river
over
which
the
hangs
is
only
feet
the
lowest
attained
on
this
journey
illustration
a
twig
bridge
the
popular
nomenclature
is
adopted
here
but
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
call
this
stream
the
and
to
defer
conferring
the
name
of
upon
it
till
the
two
great
branches
have
united
far
below
this
point
these
are
the
rising
to
the
west
of
burujird
which
with
the
tributaries
which

the

which
abounds
among

the
heat
was
frightful
and
progress
was
very
slow
owing
to
the
low
projecting
branches
of
trees
which
delayed
the
baggage
and
tore
some
of
the
tents
in
places
the
path
was
farther
obstructed
by
a
species
of
liana
known
in
new
zealand
as
a
lawyer
with
hooked
thorns
we
passed
by
the
steep
ledgy
village
of
shahbadar
on
the
roofs
of
which
i
rode
inadvertently
till
the
shouts
of
the
people
showed
me
my
error
and
encamped
on
the
only
available
spot
which
could
be
found
a
steep
bare
prominence
above
a
hollow
in
which
is
a
spring
surrounded
by
some
fine
plane
trees
the
shahbadar
people
live
in
their
village
for
three
winter
months
only
and
were
encamped
above
us
and
there
were
two
large
camps
below
men
from
each
of
them
warned
us
to
beware
of
the
others
for
they
were
robbers
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
dexterous
pilfering
which
reduced
my
table
equipments
to
a
copper
mug
one
plate
and
a
knife
and
fork
my
was
torn
to
pieces
and
pulled
down
over
me
by
a
lively
mule
which
cantered
among
the
tent
ropes
the
afternoon
with
the
mercury
at
was
spent
in
entertaining
successive
crowds
not
exactly
rude
but
full
of
untamed
curiosity
i
amused
them
to
their
complete
satisfaction
by
letting
them
blow
my
whistle
fill
my
and
put
the
whalebones
into
my
collapsible
basins
one
of
milward
needles
which
had
luckily
been
found
in
my
carpet
surprised
them
beyond
measure
every
man
and
woman
insisted
on
threading
it
with
the
eyes
shut
and
the
of
one
camp
offered
to
barter
a
sheep
for
it
they
said
that
my
shabby
tent
with
its
few
and
shabby
equipments
was
fit
for
god
the
camps
passed
on
that
day
were
constructed
of
booths
made
of
stems
of
trees
with
the
bark
on
the
roofs
being
made
of
branches
with
the
leaves
on
these
booths
are
erected
round
a
square
with
mat
walls
and
face
outwards
a
sort
of
privacy
being
obtained
by
backs
of
coarse
reed
mats
four
feet
high
and
mat
divisions
between
the
dwellings
the
sheep
goats
and
cattle
are
driven
into
the
square
at
night
through
a
narrow
entrance
walled
with
mats
since
leaving
the
karun
very
few
horses
have
been
seen
and
the
few
have
been
of
a
very
inferior
class
even
yahya
khan
who
has
the
reputation
of
being
rich
rode
a
horse
not
superior
to
a
common
pack
animal
the
people
we
have
been
among
lately
have
no
horses
or
mares
the
men
walk
and
the
loads
are
carried
on
cows
and
asses
in
the
greater
part
of
this
country
i
have
not
seen
a
mule
with
the
exception
of
some
mule
foals
on
a
high
pass
near
the
bakhtiaris
breed
mules
however
and
sell
them
in
isfahan
in
the
spring
but
rarely
use
them
for
burden
they
breed
horses
in
some
places
exporting
the
colts
and
keeping
the
fillies
their
horses
are
small
and
not
but
are
wiry
and
enduring
and
as
surefooted
as
mules
in
fact
they
will
go
anywhere
one
check
on
the
breeding
of
good
horses
is
that
when
a
man
has
a
good
foal
he
is
often
compelled
to
make
a
present
of
it
to
any
superior
who
fancies
it
the
horses
are
shod
as
in
persia
proper
with
thin
iron
plates
covering
nearly
the
whole
hoof
secured
by
six
nails
reared
in
camps
and
among
children
they
are
perfectly
gentle
and
scarcely
require
breaking
a
good
bakhtiari
horse
can
be
bought
for
or
a
good
mule
is
worth
from
to
asses
are
innumerable
and
are
used
for
transporting
baggage
equally
with
oxen
and
small
cows
a
good
donkey
can
be
bought
for
the
goats
are
very
big
and
the
sheep
which
nearly
always
are
like
the
goats
brown
or
black
and
very
tall
are
invariably
of
the
breed
with
the
great
pendulous
tails
which
sometimes
weigh
nearly
eight
pounds
they
give
a
great
deal
of
milk
and
it
is
on
this
not
on
cows
milk
that
the
people
rely
for
the
greater
part
of
their
food
their
cheese
curds
and
the
are
invaluable
to
them
they
use
them
for
holding
water
and
milk
and
as
churns
for
their
butter
they
make
all
their
tents
their
tent
carpets
and
their
sacks
for
holding
wool
of
woven
on
rude
portable
looms
the
female
costume
changed
at
shahbadar
the
women
now
wear
loose
garments
like
nightgowns
open
to
the
waist
and
reaching
from
the
neck
to
the
feet
and
red
trousers
tight
below
the
knee
but
rarely
visible
below
the
outer
dress
their
notion
of
ornament
consists
in
having
a
branch
or
frond
tattooed
up
the
throat
these
tribes
breed
cattle
extensively
one
camp
possessed
over
young
beasts
the
calves
are
nourished
by
their
mothers
up
to
two
years
old
they
have
a
few
white
angora
goats
of
great
beauty
but
the
majority
are
black
and
are
valued
chiefly
for
their
milk
and
for
their
long
coarse
hair
a
march
through
fierce
heat
at
a
low
level
brought
us
at
noon
to
the
village
of
the
road
after
continuing
along
the
same
wooded
valley
which
in
a
happier
climate
would
be
called
a
glen
emerges
on
scenery
truly
hills
covered
with
buff
grass
and
wooded
on
their
slopes
with
oak
and
hawthorn
fringing
off
into
clumps
and
single
trees
smooth
broad
valleys
first
of
buff
pasture
and
then
of
golden
wheat
or
green
maize
lie
among
the
hills
all
is
soft
and
lowland
and
was
bathed
that
day
in
a
dreamy
blue
heat
haze
not
a
mountain
rose
above
the
hills
which
were
painted
in
soft
blue
on
the
sky
of
the
distant
horizon
the
natural
wood
ceased
the
surroundings
underwent
an
abrupt
change
is
it
a
change
for
the
better
i
wonder
three
months
and
a
week
have
been
spent
in
zigzagging
among
some
of
the
loftiest
mountains
and
deepest
valleys
of
persia
and
they
now
lie
behind
among
the
things
that
were
in
fact
khuramabad
from
which
i
write
is
not
only
out
of
the
bakhtiari
country
but
the
bakhtiari
lurs
are
left
behind
and
we
are
among
the
fierce
and
undisciplined
tribes
of
the
feili
lurs
the
baggage
animals
were
not
dubious
as
i
am
as
to
the
advantages
of
the
change
when
we
reached
the
open
cock
o
the
walk
threw
up
his
beautiful
head
knocked
down
the
man
who
led
him
and
with
a
joyous
neigh
set
off
at
a
canter
followed
by
all
the
mules
and
horses
some
cantering
some
trotting
regardless
of
their
loads
and
regardless
of
everything
proceeding
irresponsibly
almost
knocking
one
out
of
the
saddle
by
striking
one
with
the
sharp
edges
of
and
tent
poles
till
they
were
headed
off
by
mounted
men
after
which
some
of
them
rolled
loads
and
all
on
the
soft
buff
grass
this
escapade
shows
what
condition
they
are
in
after
three
months
of
hard
mountain
work
reaching
the
village
at
noon
we
halted
till
moonrise
at
midnight
on
an
eminence
with
some
fine
plane
and
walnut
trees
upon
it
above
a
stream
which
issues
from
below
an
on
a
height
and
passes
close
to
a
graveyard
possibly
this
contaminates
the
water
for
there
has
been
a
great
outbreak
of
diphtheria
which
has
been
very
fatal
it
is
quite
a
small
village
but
thirteen
children
suffering
from
the
most
malignant
form
of
the
malady
some
of
them
really
dying
at
the
time
were
brought
to
me
during
the
afternoon
as
well
as
some
people
ill
of
what
appeared
to
be
typhoid
fever
one
young
creature
very
ill
was
carried
three
miles
on
her
father
back
though
i
had
sent
word
that
i
would
call
and
see
her
at
night
she
died
a
few
hours
later
of
the
exhaustion
brought
on
by
the
journey
the
mercury
that
afternoon
reached
in
the
shade
soon
after
midnight
the
mules
were
silently
loaded
and
we
stole
silently
away
to
ride
through
the
territory
of
the
powerful
sagwands
a
robber
tribe
and
reached
this
place
in
eight
hours
having
done
and
a
half
miles
it
was
a
march
full
of
risk
through
valleys
crowded
with
camps
and
the
guide
who
rode
in
front
was
very
much
frightened
whenever
the
tremendous
barking
of
the
camp
dogs
threatened
to
bring
robbers
down
on
us
in
the
uncertain
light
the
caravan
was
kept
in
steady
order
and
the
rearguard
was
frequently
hailed
by
the
leader
nothing
happened
and
when
day
broke
we
were
in
open
russet
country
among
low
formless
gravelly
hills
with
the
striking
range
of
rocky
mountains
which
hems
in
khuramabad
in
front
under
a
hazy
sky
later
fording
the
kashgan
i
got
upon
the
burujird
caravan
road
along
which
are
telegraph
poles
and
on
which
there
was
much
caravan
traffic
recrossing
the
kashgan
but
this
time
by
a
good
bridge
of
brick
on
stone
piers
the
yafta
kuh
came
in
sight
and
khuramabad
with
its
green
gardens
its
walls
of
precipitous
mountains
and
its
ruined
fort
on
an
isolated
and
most
picturesque
rock
in
the
centre
of
the
town
a
very
striking
view
khuramabad
before
the
fourteenth
century
was
called
diz
siyah
or
the
black
fort
and
was
the
capital
of
the
atabegs
the
powerful
kings
who
reigned
in
from
to
about
sir
rawlinson
does
not
regard
any
of
its
remains
as
earlier
than
the
eleventh
or
twelfth
century
the
camps
are
outside
the
town
on
a
stretch
of
burning
gravel
with
some
scorched
pasture
beyond
it
on
which
are
ilyat
camps
then
there
are
divers
ranges
of
blackish
and
reddish
mountains
with
pale
splashes
of
scorched
herbage
when
there
is
any
at
all
behind
my
tent
are
a
clump
of
willows
an
irrigating
stream
large
gardens
full
of
fruit
trees
and
melons
and
legions
of
mosquitos
circumstances
have
changed
and
the
surroundings
now
belong
to
the
showy
civilisation
of
persia
as
i
was
lying
under
the
trees
quite
knocked
up
by
the
long
and
fatiguing
night
march
and
the
great
heat
i
heard
fluent
french
being
spoken
with
a
good
accent
the
of
the
governor
had
called
cavalcades
of
persians
on
showy
horses
gaily
caparisoned
dashed
past
frequently
ten
infantrymen
arrived
as
a
guard
and
stacked
their
arms
under
the
willows
and
four
obsequious
servants
brought
me
trays
of
fruit
and
sweetmeats
put
up
in
vine
leaves
from
the
governor
melons
are
a
drug
the
servants
are
amusing
themselves
in
the
bazars
it
is
a
bewildering
transition
the
altitude
is
only
feet
and
the
heat
is
awful
the
heat
of
the
indian
plains
without
indian
appliances
when
the
men
took
up
stones
with
which
to
hammer
the
tent
pegs
they
dropped
them
like
hot
potatoes
the
paraffin
candles
melt
milk
turns
sour
in
one
hour
even
night
brings
little
coolness
it
is
only
heat
and
darkness
instead
of
heat
and
light
i
was
too
much
exhausted
by
heat
and
fatigue
to
march
last
night
and
rested
as
far
as
was
possible
merely
going
to
pay
my
respects
to
the
governor
of
luristan
the
and
the
ladies
of
his
the
characteristics
of
this
official
face
are
anxiety
and
unhappiness
there
was
the
usual
persian
etiquette
attendants
in
the
rear
scribes
and
bowing
and
kneeling
in
front
and
tea
and
cigarettes
in
the
pretty
garden
of
the
palace
of
which
cypresses
pomegranates
and
roses
are
the
chief
features
mirza
was
not
allowed
to
attend
me
in
the
but
a
who
spoke
a
little
very
bad
french
and
understood
less
stood
behind
a
curtain
and
attempted
to
interpret
but
failed
so
signally
that
after
one
or
two
compliments
i
was
obliged
to
leave
after
ascertaining
that
a
really
beautiful
girl
of
fourteen
is
the
reigning
favourite
the
women
rooms
were
pretty
and
the
women
themselves
were
richly
but
elegantly
dressed
and
graceful
in
manner
though
under
difficulties
after
a
visit
to
the
ruined
fort
an
interesting
and
picturesque
piece
of
masonry
i
rode
unmolested
through
the
town
and
bazars
khuramabad
the
importance
of
which
lies
in
its
situation
on
what
is
regarded
as
the
best
commercial
route
from
shuster
to
tihran
is
the
capital
of
the
feili
lurs
and
the
residence
of
the
governor
of
luristan
picturesque
at
a
distance
beyond
any
persian
town
that
i
have
seen
with
its
citadel
rising
in
the
midst
of
a
precipitous
pass
its
houses
grouped
round
the
base
its
fine
bridge
its
wooded
gardens
its
greenery
and
the
rich
valley
to
the
south
of
the
gorge
in
which
it
stands
it
successfully
rivals
any
persian
town
in
its
squalor
dirt
evil
odours
and
ruinous
condition
of
what
was
the
once
famous
capital
of
the
atabegs
are
now
ruinous
heaps
the
bazars
are
small
badly
supplied
dark
and
rude
and
the
roads
are
nothing
but
foul
alleys
possibly
once
paved
but
now
full
of
ridges
holes
ruins
rubbish
lean
and
mangy
dogs
men
and
broken
channels
of
water
which
dribbling
over
the
soil
in
the
bazars
and
everywhere
else
in
green
and
black
slime
gives
forth
pestiferous
odours
in
the
hot
sun
the
people
slouch
about
slowly
they
are
evidently
very
poor
and
the
merchants
have
the
melancholy
apathetic
look
which
tells
that
trade
is
bad
the
feili
lurs
who
render
the
caravan
route
to
dizful
incessantly
insecure
paralyse
the
trade
of
what
should
and
might
be
a
prosperous
distributing
point
and
the
persian
government
though
it
keeps
a
regiment
of
soldiers
here
is
unsuccessful
in
checking
far
less
in
curing
the
chronic
disorder
which
has
produced
a
nearly
complete
stagnation
in
trade
i
am
all
the
more
disappointed
with
the
wretched
condition
of
khuramabad
because
the
decayed
state
of
its
walls
is
concealed
by
trees
and
it
is
entered
by
a
handsome
bridge
feet
wide
and
long
with
pointed
arches
of
solid
masonry
with
a
fine
caravanserai
with
a
tiled
entrance
on
its
left
side
the
bala
hissar
is
a
really
striking
object
its
pile
of
ancient
buildings
crowning
the
steep
mass
of
naked
rock
which
rises
out
of
the
dark
greenery
and
lofty
poplars
and
cypresses
of
the
irrigated
gardens
this
fort
which
is
in
ruins
encloses
within
its
double
walls
the
wali
palace
and
other
official
buildings
and
a
fine
reservoir
feet
by
fed
by
a
vigorous
spring
in
the
gardens
by
the
river
north
of
the
fort
are
some
remains
of
the
walls
and
towers
of
the
ancient
atabeg
capital
and
there
are
also
ruins
of
an
aqueduct
and
of
an
ancient
bridge
of
which
ten
arches
are
still
standing
the
most
interesting
relic
however
is
a
round
tower
sixty
feet
high
in
fairly
good
preservation
with
a
kufic
inscription
round
the
top
it
is
said
that
there
are
houses
in
khuramabad
which
would
give
it
a
population
of
over
it
has
been
visited
by
several
englishmen
for
purposes

upon

august
a
night
march
of
miles
through
perilous
country
brought
us
in
blazing
heat
to
an
encampment
of
seyyids
of
the
bairanawand
tribe
men
showing
in
their
haughty
bearing
their
pride
in
their
illustrious
lineage
but
not
above
depriving
us
during
the
night
of
many
useful
articles
their
camp
had
three
streets
of
tents
in
front
of
which
oxen
were
treading
out
wheat
all
day
long
these
seyyids
have
much
wealth
in
mares
and
oxen
again
we
started
at
moonrise
for
what
was
regarded
as
a
dangerous
march
a
party
of
sagwands
having
gone
on
ahead
with
hostile
intentions
it
was
said
however
nothing
happened
and
nothing
was
heard
except
the
shouts
of
our
own
and
the
pandemonium
made
by
the
simultaneous
barking
of
huge
dogs
in
the
many
camps
we
passed
but
could
not
see
we
rode
through
cultivated
valleys
full
of
nomads
forded
the
placid
bawali
and
at
dawn
were
at
the
foot
of
the
grand
pass
of
handawan
feet
in
altitude
which
is
ascended
by
steep
zigzags
over
worn
rock
ledges
and
the
dry
bed
of
a
torrent
a
descent
of
feet
and
a
long
ride
among
large
formless
hills
took
us
to
a
narrow
gorge
or
chasm
with
a
fine
mountain
torrent
and
thence
to
the
magnificent
from
which
we
emerged
with
some
suddenness
on
the
slopes
of
the
low
on
the
north
side
of
the
plain
of
burujird
or
silakhor
this
very
rich
plain
about
thirty
miles
long
by
from
six
to
eight
broad
has
been
described
as
waterlogged
and
the
level
of
the
water
is
only
a
foot
below
the
surface
certainly
very
numerous
springs
and
streams
rise
along
the
hill
slopes
which
we
traversed
and
flow
down
into
the
plain
which
is
singularly
flat
and
most
of
it
only
relieved
from
complete
monotony
by
the
villages
which
to
the
number
of
are
sprinkled
over
it
many
of
them
raised
on
artificial
mounds
at
once
to
avoid
the
miasma
from
the
and
as
a
protection
from
the
lurs
above
the
end
rises
the
grand
bulk
of
shuturun
kuh
with
a
few
still
lingering
and
towards
the
other
lies
the
town
of
burujird
the
neighbourhood
of
which
for
a
few
miles
is
well
planted
but
most
of
the
plain
is
devoid
of
trees
it
is
watered
by
many
streams
which
flow
into
the
burujird
river
and
the
which
uniting
leave
the
plain
by
the
magnificent
the
first
view
on
emerging
from
the
buff
treeless
mountains
was
very
attractive
the
tall
grass
of
the
rich
marshy
pastures
rippled
in
the
breeze
in
wavelets
of
a
steely
sheen
brown
villages
on
mounds
contrasted
with
the
vivid
green
of
the
young
rice
towards
burujird
of
which
nothing
but
the
gilding
of
a
dome
was
visible
a
mass
of
dark
greenery
refreshed
the
eyes
the
charm
of
the
whole
was
the
contrast
between
the
dry
and
thirsty
land
where
no
water
is
and
abundant
moisture
between
the
scanty
and
scorched
herbage
of
the
arid
mountains
and
the
trees
planted
by
the
rivers
of
water
but
i
confess
that
the
length
and
overpowering
fatigue
of
that
miles
march
much
of
it
in
blazing
heat
following
on
three
nights
without
sleep
soon
dulled
my
admiration
of
the
plain
hour
after
hour
passed
on
its
gravelly
margin
then
came
melon
beds
files
of
donkeys
loaded
with
melons
in
nets
gardens
of
cucumbers
and
gourds
each
with
its
lodge
irrigation
channels
dykes
apricot
and
mulberry
orchards
lanes
bordered
with
the
graceful
a
large
and
busy
village
where
after
a
very
uncertain
progress
we
got
a
local
guide
and
then
a
low
isolated
hill
crowned
by
a
dwelling
arranged
for
security
and
a
liberally
planted
garden
a
platform
with
terraced
slopes
and
straight
formal
walks
a
terrace
with
a
fine
view
and
two
tanks
full
of
turtles
which
abound
in
many
places
under
large
willows
giving
a
pleasant
shade
between
them
i
have
pitched
my
tents
with
the
lines
of
an
old
hymn
constantly
occurring
to
me
interval
of
grateful
shade
welcome
to
my
weary
head
burujird
one
and
a
half
mile
off
and
scarcely
seen
above
the
intervening
woods
gives
a
suggestion
of
civilisation
to
the
landscape
in
the
sunset
which
is
somewhat
fiery
shuturun
and
the
precipices
of
the
are
reddening
the
last
three
marches
have
been
more
severe
than
the
whole
travelling
of
the
last
three
months

thought
that
no
call
to

will
break

this
untoward
affair
ended
well
but
had
there
been
bloodshed
on
either
side
had
any
one
of
us
been
killed
which
easily
might
have
been
the
world
would
never
have
believed
but
that
some
offence
had
been
given
and
that
some
action
had
been
the
cause
of
the
attack
i
am
in
a
position
to
say
not
only
that
no
offence
was
given
but
that
here
and
everywhere
the
utmost
care
was
taken
not
to
violate
bakhtiari
etiquette
or
wound
religious
or
national
susceptibilities
all
supplies
were
paid
for
above
their
value
the
servants
always
under
our
own
eyes
were
friendly
but
reserved
and
in
all
dealings
with
the
people
kindness
and
justice
were
the
rule
i
make
these
remarks
in
the
hope
of
modifying
any
harsh
judgments
which
may
be
passed
upon
any
travellers
who
have
died
unwitnessed
deaths
at
the
hands
of
natives
there
are
as
in
our
case
absolutely
unprovoked
attacks
see
appendix
a
i
am
inclined
to
estimate
the
bakhtiari
population
at
a
higher
figure
than
some
travellers
have
given
i
took
men
at
random
from
the
poorest
class
and
from
various
tribes
and
got
from
them
the
number
of
their
families
wives
and
children

being
included

the
average
was

burujird
a
week
has
glided
away
since
i
sent
my
last
diary
letter
with
only
two
events
of
direct
personal
interest
one
being
that
i
have
bought
a
young
powerful
little
bakhtiari
horse
which
has
been
in
camp
since
we
left
the
karun
river
a
dark
bay
with
black
points
big
feet
a
big
ugly
head
and
big
flopping
ears
but
otherwise
passably
an
unsuspicious
animal
brought
up
in
tent
life
with
children
rolling
about
among
his
feet
and
as
yet
quite
ignorant
that
man
can
be
anything
but
his
friend
i
intend
to
look
after
his
but
not
to
make
a
pet
of
him
the
other
event
occurred
on
the
morning
after
our
arrival
and
took
the
place
of
the
boot
and
saddle
call
for
i
was
awakened
very
early
by
a
hubbub
round
my
tent
the
interpretation
of
which
was
that
a
packing
case
in
three
compartments
containing
my
cooking
utensils
remaining
table
equipments
and
stores
had
been
carried
off
before
daylight
deposited
in
an
adjacent
plantation
broken
open
and
emptied
thus
i
was
left
with
nothing
and
have
been
unable
to
get
anything
in
the
bazars
here
except
two
cooking
pots
and
a
tin
teapot
of
unique
construction
made
to
order
the
few
other
things
which
i
still
regard
as
absolute
necessaries
a
cup
plate
knife
fork
and
spoon
have
been
lent
me
by
the
agha
all
my
tea
is
gone
the
worst
loss
of
all
later
in
the
day
hassan
came
in
a
quiet
rage
saying
that
he
would
leave
for
isfahan
at
once
because
mirza
had
accused
him
of
not
keeping
an
efficient
watch
and
shortly
afterwards
mahomet
ali
and
his
handsome
donkey
actually
did
leave
burujird
bears
a
very
bad
reputation
here
last
year
a
young
english
officer
was
robbed
of
his
tents
and
horses
and
everything
but
the
clothes
he
wore
the
governor
on
hearing
of
the
theft
said
i
should
not
have
camped
in
the
wilderness
the
wilderness
being
a
beautifully
kept
garden
with
a
gardener
who
was
arrested
and
a
house
for
the
last
week
a
guard
of
six
soldiers
has
watched
by
day
and
night
the
news
received
from
the
bakhtiari
country
is
rather
startling
mirab
khan
who
looked
too
ill
and
frail
for
active
warfare
sent
a
messenger
with
a
letter
to
khaja
taimur
urging
him
to
join
him
in
an
attack
on
aslam
khan
the
letter
was
intercepted
by
this
judas
and
now
the
country
from
kalahoma
to
khanabad
is
in
a
flame
serious
troubles
have
broken
out
in
this
plain
all
the
khans
of
the
sagwand
tribe
having
united
to
rise
against
the
payment
of
a
tribute
which
they
regard
as
heavy
enough
to
crush
the
life
out
of
the
people
the
has
telegraphed
for
troops
and
the
governor
of
luristan
is
said
to
be
coming
with
men
a
tribute
insurrection
on
a
larger
or
smaller
scale
is
a
common
autumnal
event
the
khans
complain
of
being
oppressed
by
merciless
exactions
they
say
that
the
tribute
fixed
by
the
shah
is
not
too
much
but
that
it
is
doubled
and
more
by
the
rapacity
of
governors
and
that
the
people
are
growing
poorer
every
year
they
complain
that
when
they
decline
to
pay
more
than
the
tribute
fixed
by
the
soldiers
are
sent
who
drive
off
their
mares
herds
of
cattle
and
flocks
to
the
extent
of
three
four
and
five
times
the
sum
demanded
these
few
words
contain
the
substance
of
statements
almost
universally
made
there
is
probably
another
side
and
they
may
be
true
in
part
only
the
tribesmen
of
silakhor
state
that
they
had
protested
and
appealed
in
vain
before
they
decided
on
resistance
every
khan
with
whom
i
have
conversed
has
besought
me
to
lay
his
case
before
the
english
vakil
at
tihran
this
belief
in
england
as
the
redresser
of
wrongs
is
very
touching
and
very
palatable
to
one
national
pride
all
these
people
have
heard
of
the
way
in
which
the
cultivators
in
india
have
been
treated
of
land
settlements
and
english
settlement
officers
and
they
say
england
could
make
everything
right
for
us
so
she
could
and
she
would
as
the
governors
pay
large
sums
for
offices
from
which
they
are
removable
at
the
shah
pleasure
and
as
the
lower
officials
all
pay
more
or
less
heavily
for
their
positions
we
may
reasonably
infer
that
all
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
put
on
the
screw
and
squeeze
all
they
can
out
of
the
people
over
and
above
the
tribute
fixed
at
tihran
near
views
of
oriental
despotisms
are
as
disenchanting
as
near
views
of
the
noble
savage
for
they
contain
within
themselves
the
seeds
of
all
villainies
which
rarely
if
ever
fail
of
fructification
mirza
karim
khan
the
governor
of
burujird
called
a
few
days
ago
a
young
man
with
very
fine
features
but
a
look
of
serious
bad
health
he
complained
so
much
that
the
agha
asked
his
attendant
a
very
juvenile
speaking
a
little
scarcely
intelligible
french
if
he
would
object
to
the
governor
taking
something
from
the
famous
leather
box
and
the
effect
was
so
magical
that
the
next
day
he
looked
a
different
man
an
arrangement
was
made
for
returning
the
visit
and
he
received
us
in
a
handsome
tent
in
a
garden
with
the
usual
formalities
but
only
a
scribe
and
the
were
present
a
sent
from
burujird
with
a
letter
to
the
sahib
was
undoubtedly
robbed
of
his
horse
gun
and
some
of
his
clothing
very
quietly
the
governor
denied
this
but
as
he
did
so
i
saw
a
wink
pass
between
the
scribe
and
it
was
a
pitiable
sight
a
high
official
sitting
there
with
luxuries
about
him
in
a
city
with
its
walls
embankments
and
gates
ruinous
the
brickwork
in
the
palace
gardens
lying
in
heaps
his
province
partially
disturbed
the
people
rising
against
what
at
the
least
are
oppressive
exactions
raising
an
enormous
tribute
from
which
there
is
no
outlay
on
province
or
city
government
for
the
good
of
the
governed
never
entering
into
his
as
rarely
into
any
other
oriental
mind
this
evening
he
has
made
a
farewell
visit
on
the
terrace
attended
by
the
aziz
khan
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
carpet
and
occasionally
interjected
a
remark
into
the
conversation
i
have
before
said
that
he
has
a
certain
gentlemanliness
and
even
dignity
and
his
manner
was
neither
cringing
nor
familiar
the
however
warned
him
not
to
speak
in
presence
of
the
governor
a
restraint
which
though
very
different
from
the
free
intercourse
of
retainers
with
their
chiefs
among
the
bakhtiari
was
in
strict
accordance
with
the
proprieties
of
persian
etiquette
aziz
stalked
away
shaking
his
wide
with
an
air
of
contempt
this
governor
he
afterwards
said
what
is
he
if
it
were
isfandyar
khan
and
he
were
lying
down
my
head
would
be
next
to
his
and
twenty
more
men
would
be
lying
round
him
to
guard
his
life
with
ours
it
seems
as
if
burujird
were
destitute
of
cavalry
at
least
of
men
who
can
be
spared
though
it
has
been
stated
that
a
whole
cavalry
regiment
is
in
garrison
the
governor
promised
three
escorts
my
modest
request
was
for
one
and
a
very
horseman
has
arrived
for
me
but
now
within
an
hour
of
marching
the
others
are
without
even
one
attended
by
the
and
an
escort
we
rode
yesterday
through
burujird
to
write
that
a
third
of
it
is
in
ruins
is
simply
to
write
that
it
is
a
persian
town
it
has
crumbling
mud
walls
said
to
be
five
miles
in
circumference
five
gates
in
bad
repair
and
a
ditch
now
partially
cultivated
it
is
situated
in

its
long
is
its
elevation
is
feet
bell
its
population
is
estimated
at
from

includes
a

and
it
has
a
persian
telegraph
office
and
post

neither
of
them

depended
upon
six
large

very
many
small

a

it
manufactures

it
also
produces

the

look
very
thriving
and
they
were
crowded
with
buyers
possibly
the
people
have
rarely
if
ever
seen
a
feringhi
woman
and
they
crowded
very
much
upon
me
and
the
escort
drove
them
off
in
the
usual
fashion
with
sticks
and
stones
though
much
of
burujird
lies
in
ruins
it
has
a
fair
aspect
of
prosperity
and
some
very
good
houses
and
new
buildings
the

are
cobbled
with
great

are
certainly
not
worse
than
those
of

district
but
it
is
connected
by
caravan
routes
with
the
best
agricultural
and
commercial
regions
of
persia
to
the
north
east
and
west
by
easy
roads
never
or
at
least
they
never
need
be
if
there
were
traffic
enough
to
keep
them
open
it
is
only
miles
from
rich
kirmanshah
from
the
fertile
district
which
surrounds
hamadan
from
sultanabad
the
most
important
region
of
western
persia
and
rich
besides
in
grain
and
cotton
from
kûm
on
the
main
road
from
isfahan
to
tihran
something
about
from
tihran
and
only
from
ahwaz
these
routes
are
all
easy
though
so
far
as
i
know
them
very
badly
supplied
with
caravanserais
except
on
the
main
road
between
the
two
capitals
the
southern
road
leading
through
khuramabad
to
dizful
and
shuster
has
no
great
natural
difficulties
though
part
of
it
lies
through
a
mountainous
region
some
blasting
and
much
would
according
to
colonel
bell
remedy
the
evils
of
the
fifty
miles
of
it
which
he
regards
as
bad
but
apart
from
this
the
route
the
most
route
for
north
and
persian
commerce
to
take
to
and
from
the
sea
is
at
present
useless
to
trade
from
its
insecurity
as
the
feili
lurs
through
whose
territory
it
passes
own
no
authority
live
by
robbery
when
they
have
any
one
to
rob
and
are
always
fighting
each
other
there
are
no
regular
in
burujird
and
many
and
tedious
have
been
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
getting
off
up
to
last
night
i
had
no
mules
and
hadji
said
mournfully
when
you
learn
what
other
are
like
you
think
of
me
i
have
taken
leave
of
aziz
khan
with
regret
he
echoes
the
question
why
does
not
england
come
and
give
us
peace
in
a
few
years
we
should
all
be
rich
and
not
have
to
fight
each
other
stay
among
us
for
some
years
he
said
and
you
will
get
very
rich
what
have
you
to
go
back
to
in
feringhistan
he
asked
me
for
a
purse
and
to
put
some
in
it
for
his
children
but
not
to
give
him
any
money
he
said
that
when
he
asked
for
money
and
other
things
he
was
only
in
fun
i
do
not
know
whether
to
believe
him
mirza
and
my
caravan
started
this
morning
and
now
i
am
leaving
with
the
with
the
mercury
at
for
the
first
march
of
a
journey
of
miles
footnotes
i
have
since
heard
that
this
youth
was
an
accomplice
of
a
burujird
man
in
this
theft
and
of
an
armenian
in
a
robbery
of
money
which
occurred
in
berigun
throughout
the
part
of
persia
in
which
i
have
travelled
i
have
observed
a
most
remarkable
discrepancy
between
the
numbers
of
soldiers
to
garrison
any
given
place
and
the
number
which
on
further
investigation
turned
out
to
be
actually
there
it
is
safe
to
deduct
from
fifty
to
ninety
per
cent
from
the
number
in
the
original
statement
letter
xxii
hamadan
it
was
as
i
thought
the
sent
with
me
was
only
a
harmless
peasant
taken
from
the
plough
mounted
on
his
own
horse
and
provided
with
a
government
gun
the
poor
fellow
showed
the
white
feather
on
the
first
march
and
i
was
obliged
to
assert
the
ascendency
of
race
and
ride
in
front
of
him
the
villagers
at
once
set
him
down
as
an
impostor
and
refused
him
supplies
and
as
his
horse
could
not
keep
up
with
mine
and
the
road
presented
no
apparent
perils
i
dismissed
him
at
the
end
of
three
days
with
a
which
gladdened
his
heart
he
did
not
know
the
way
and
the
afternoon
i
left
burujird
he
led
me
through
ploughed
fields
and
along
roadless
hillsides
till
at
the
end
of
an
hour
i
found
myself
close
to
the
garden
from
which
i
started
the
early
part
of
the
first
march
is
over
great
bare
gravelly
slopes
without
water
then
come
irrigation
and
villages
the
hills
have
been
eaten
nearly
bare
nothing
remains
but
a
yellow
salvia
and
the
beautiful
there
as
in
the
bakhtiari
country
the
people
stack
the
for
winter
fodder
the
road
is
good
and
except
in
two
places
a
carriage
could
be
driven
over
it
at
a
trot
the
was
outside
deswali
an
unwalled
village
of
houses
with
extensive
cultivated
lands
and
a
aspect
the
people
raise
cereals
melons
cucumbers
grapes
and
cotton
but
in
bad
seasons
have
to
import
wheat
there
as
at
every
village
since
the
has
called
upon
me
and
some
of
these
men
have
been
intelligent
and
communicative
and
have
shown
such
courtesies
as
have
been
in
their
power
it
is
an
unusual
if
not
an
thing
for
a
european
lady
even
if
she
knows
persian
to
travel
through
this
country
without
a
european
escort
but
there
has
been
no
rudeness
or
impertinent
curiosity
no
crowding
even
the
headmen
all
seemed
anxious
for
my
comfort
and
supplies
at
reasonable
rates
have
always
been
forthcoming
the
heat
at
deswali
was
overpowering
the
mercury
in
my
tent
standing
for
hours
on
august
at
the
temperature
in
the
shade
being
it
is
vain
to
form
any
resolution
against
making
a
pet
of
a
horse
my
new
acquisition
insisted
on
being
petted
and
his
winning
and
enticing
ways
are
irresistible
he
is
always
tethered
in
front
of
my
tent
with
a
rope
so
long
as
to
give
him
a
considerable
amount
of
liberty
and
he
took
advantage
of
this
the
very
first
day
to
come
into
the
tent
and
make
it
very
apparent
that
he
wanted
me
to
divide
a
melon
with
him
grapes
were
his
next
then
cucumber
bread
and
biscuits
then
he
actually
drank
milk
out
of
a
soup
plate
he
comes
up
to
me
and
puts
his
head
down
to
have
his
ears
rubbed
and
if
i
do
not
attend
to
him
at
once
or
cease
attending
to
him
he
gives
me
a
gentle
but
admonitory
thump
i
dine
outside
the
tent
and
he
is
tied
to
my
chair
and
waits
with
wonderful
patience
for
the
odds
and
ends
only
occasionally
rubbing
his
soft
nose
against
my
face
to
remind
me
that
he
is
there
up
to
this
time
a
friendly
snuffle
is
the
only
sound
that
he
has
made
he
does
not
know
how
to
fight
or
that
teeth
and
heels
are
of
any
other
use
than
to
eat
and
walk
with
he
is
really
the
gentlest
and
most
docile
of
his
race
the
point
at
which
he
draws
the
line
is
being
led
he
drags
back
and
a
mulish
look
comes
into
his
sweet
eyes
but
he
follows
like
a
dog
and
as
i
walk
as
much
as
i
can
i
always
have
him
with
me
he
comes
when
i
call
him
stops
when
i
stop
goes
off
the
road
with
me
when
i
go
in
search
of
flowers
and
usually
puts
his
head
either
on
my
shoulder
or
under
my
arm
to
him
i
am
an
embodiment
of
melons
cucumbers
grapes
pears
peaches
biscuits
and
sugar
with
a
good
deal
of
petting
and
thrown
in
every
day
he
becomes
more
of
a
companion
he
walks
very
fast
gallops
easily
never
stumbles
can
go
anywhere
is
never
tired
and
is
always
hungry
i
paid
for
him
but
he
was
bought
from
the
bakhtiaris
for
as
a
he
is
up
to
sixteen
stone
jumps
very
well
and
is
an
excellent
travelling
horse
redundant
forelocks
and
wavy
manes
uncut
tails
carried
in
fiery
fashion
small
noses
quivering
nostrils
small
restless
ears
and
sweet
intelligent
eyes
add
wonderfully
to
the
attractiveness
of
the
various
points
of
excellence
which
attract
a
in
persia
a
persian
horse
in
good
condition
may
be
backed
against
any
horse
in
the
world
for
powers
endurance
steadiness
and
surefootedness
is
seldom
unsound
and
is
to
his
rider
a
friend
as
well
as
a
servant
generally
speaking
a
horse
can
carry
his
rider
wherever
a
mule
can
carry
a
load
and
will
do
from
thirty
to
forty
miles
a
day
for
almost
any
length
of
time
the
clothing
of
horses
is
an
important
matter
even
in
this
hot
weather
they
wear
a
good
deal
first
a
or
shirt
of
fine
wool
crossed
over
the
chest
next
the
a
similar
garment
but
in
coarser
wool
and
at
night
over
all
this
is
put
the
a
piece
of
felt
half
an
inch
thick
so
long
that
it
wraps
the
animal
from
head
to
tail
and
so
deep
as
to
cover
his
body
down
to
his
knees
a
broad
surcingle
of
woollen
webbing
keeps
the
whole
in
place
the
food
does
not
vary
it
consists
of
from
seven
to
ten
pounds
of
barley
daily
in
two
feeds
and
as
much
as
a
horse
can
eat
of
which
is
straw
broken
in
pieces
about
an
inch
and
a
half
long
while
travelling
barley
and
are
mixed
in
the
no
hay
is
given
and
there
are
no
oats
it
is
customary
among
the
rich
to
give
their
horses
an
exclusive
diet
of
barley
grass
for
one
month
in
the
spring
on
which
they
grow
very
fat
and
useless
old
horses
are
fed
on
made
of
and
water
a
grape
diet
is
also
given
in
the
regions
in
the
autumn
instead
of
eats
ten
pounds
of
grapes
as
a
mere
dessert
i
admire
and
like
the
persian
horse
his
beauty
is
a
constant
enjoyment
and
ferocious
as
he
is
to
his
fellows
he
is
gentle
and
docile
to
man
i
can
not
now
recall
having
seen
a
vicious
horse
in
seven
months
on
the
whole
they
are
very
well
cared
for
and
are
kindly
treated
the
sore
backs
of
baggage
horses
are
almost
inevitable
quite
so
indeed
so
long
as
the
present
form
of
stuffed
with
is
used
mares
are
not
ridden
in
persia
proper
the
march
from
deswali
to
sahmine
is
a
pretty
one
at
first
over
long
buff
rolling
hills
and
through
large
elevated
villages
then
turning
off
from
the
kirmanshah
road
and
descending
into
a
broad
plain
the
whole
of
which
for
several
miles
is
occupied
by
the
trees
and
gardens
of
the
eminently
prosperous
village
of
sahmine
whose
families
though
they
pay
a
tribute
of
a
year
have
nothing
to
complain
of
i
was
delighted
with
the
oasis
of
sahmine
it
has
abundant
water
for
irrigation
which
means
abundant
fertility
its
walnut
trees
are
magnificent
and
its
gardens
are
filled
with
noble
fruit
trees
the
wheat
harvest
was
being
brought
in
and
within
the
walls
it
was
difficult
to
find
a
place
to
camp
on
for
all
the
open
spaces
were
piled
with
sheaves
of
wheat
and
mounds
of
in
the
midst
of
which
oxen
in
spans
of
two
were
threshing
that
is
they
drew
machines
like
heavy
wood
sleds
with
transverse
revolving
wooden
rollers
set
with
iron
fans
at
different
angles
which
cut
the
straw
to
pieces
a
great
heap
of
unbound
sheaves
is
in
the
centre
and
from
this
men
throw
down
the
stalked
ears
till
they
come
up
to
the
bodies
of
the
oxen
adding
more
as
fast
as
the
straw
is
trodden
down
a
boy
sits
on
the
car
and
keeps
the
animals
going
in
a
circle
hour
after
hour
with
a
rope
and
a
stick
the
foremost
oxen
are
muzzled
the
grain
falls
out
during
this
process
on
a
windy
day
the
great
heaps
are
tossed
into
the
air
on
a
fork
the
straw
is
carried
for
a
short
distance
and
the
grain
falling
to
the
ground
is
removed
and
placed
in
great
clay
jars
in
the
of
the
houses
all
the
villages
are
now
surrounded
with
mounds
of
which
will
be
stored
before
snow
comes
the
dustiness
of
this
winnowing
process
is
indescribable
i
was
nearly
smothered
with
it
in
sahmine
and
on
windy
days
each
village
is
enveloped
in
a
yellow
dust
storm
sahmine
though
it
has
many
ruinous
buildings
has
much
building
going
on
it
has
large
houses
with
a
khan
fort
with
many
houses
inside
a
square
with
fine
trees
and
a
stream
and
a
with
a
stream
where
dyers
were
at
work
and
there
are
five
small
mosques
and
the
gardens
are
quite
beautiful
and
it
is
indeed
a
very
attractive
village
the
people
also
were
attractive
and
friendly
after
the
official
visit
the
khan
wives
called
and
pressed
me
very
hospitably
to
leave
my
tent
and
live
with
them
and
when
i
refused
they
sent
me
a
dinner
of
persian
dishes
with
sweetmeats
made
by
their
own
hands
the
were
quite
appetising
they
are
a
favourite
persian
dish
made
of
pieces
of
seasoned
meat
roasted
on
skewers
and
served
very
hot
between
flaps
of
very
hot
bread
each
bit
of
meat
is
rubbed
with
an
onion
before
being
put
on
the
skewer
and
a
thin
slice
of
tail
fat
is
put
between
every
two
pieces
the
cooks
show
great
art
in
the
rapidity
with
which
they
rotate
a
skewer
full
of
over
a
fierce
charcoal
fire
in
the
evening
at
the
request
i
held
a
reception
outside
my
tent
and
it
was
a
very
pleasant
merry
affair
several
of
the
people
brought
their
children
and
the
little
things
behaved
most
graciously
it
is
very
pleasant
to
see
the
devotion
of
the
men
to
them
i
told
them
that
in
england
many
of
our
people
are
so
poor
that
instead
of
children
being
welcome
they
are
regarded
ruefully
as
additional
mouths
to
feed
ah
said
the
a
handsome
seyyid
your
land
is
then
indeed
under
the
curse
of
god
we
would
like
ten
children
at
once
they
are
the
joy
of
our
lives
other
men
followed
expatiating
on
the
delights
of
having
children
to
pet
and
play
with
on
their
return
from
work
sahmine
not
only
dyes
and
prints
cottons
but
it
exports
wheat
barley
opium
cotton
and
fruit
and
appears
a
more
important
and
prosperous
place
than
daulatabad
the
capital
of
the
district
the
fine
valley
between
sahmine
and
daulatabad
is
irrigated
by
a
and
canals
and
is
completely
cultivated
bearing
heavy
crops
of
wheat
cotton
tobacco
opium
and
castor
oil
the
wheat
is
now
being
carried
to
the
villages
on
asses
backs
in
great
nets
lashed
to
poles
placed
in
front
and
behind
each
pole
being
kept
steady
by
a
man
the
heat
on
that
march
was
severe
a
heavy
hung
over
the
distances
vegetation
drooped
my
mock
wrapped
up
his
head
in
his
the
horses
looked
limp
the
harvesters
slept
under
the
trees
the
buffaloes
lay
down
in
mud
and
water
even
the
greenery
of
the
extensive
gardens
in
and
around
daulatabad
scarcely
looked
cool
daulatabad
is
a
walled
city
of
souls
has
a
fort
and
is
reputed
to
have
a
large
garrison
the
bazars
which
contain
shops
are
indifferent
and
the
five
caravanserais
wretched
it
and
its
extensive
gardens
occupy
the
eastern
extremity
of
a
plain
and
lie
very
near
the
steep
rocky
mountain
sard
kuh
through
which
by
the
the
tihran
road
passes
another
road
over
the
shoulder
of
the
mountain
goes
to
isfahan
the
plain
outside
the
walls
has
neither
tree
nor
bush
and
was
only
brought
into
cultivation
two
years
ago
the
harvest
was
carried
and
as
irrigation
had
been
suspended
for
some
weeks
there
was
nothing
but
a
yellow
expanse
of
short
thin
stubble
and
blazing
gravel
there
was
no
space
for
camping
in
any
available
garden
and
an
hour
was
spent
in
finding
a
with
wholesome
water
on
the
burning
plain
before
mentioned
i
camped
below
a
terraced
and
planted
eminence
on
which
a
building
half
fort
and
half
governor
house
has
so
recently
been
erected
that
it
has
not
had
time
to
become
ruinous
it
is
an
imposing
quadrangle
with
blank
walls
towers
with
windows
at
the
corners
and
a
very
large
over
the
entrance
a
winding
well
planted
leads
up
to
it
and
there
is
a
circular
with
a
concrete
floor
and
a
fountain
the
most
surprising
object
was
a
new
landau
standing
under
a
tree
barracks
are
being
built
just
below
the
house
while
my
tent
was
being
pitched
the
governor
attended
by
a
cavalry
escort
called
and
with
much
courtesy
offered
me
the
arranged
he
said
in
european
fashion
the
governor
was
absent
but
this
officer
said
that
it
would
be
his
wish
to
offer
me
hospitality
as
i
felt
quite
unable
to
move
he
sent
a
skin
of
good
water
some
fruit
and
a
guard
of
four
soldiers
it
was
only
when
the
tents
were
pitched
and
the
long
day
which
followed
was
barely
endurable
the
mercury
reached
inside
my
tent
the
servants
lay
in
a
dry
ditch
under
a
tree
in
the
governor
garden
several
times
came
into
the
shade
of
my
verandah
the
black
flies
swarmed
over
everything
and
at
sunset
covered
the
whole
roof
of
the
tent
so
thickly
that
no
part
of
it
could
be
seen
the
sun
a
white
scintillating
ball
blazed
from
a
steely
sky
over
which
no
cloud
ever
passed
the
heated
atmosphere
quivered
over
the
burning
earth
i
was
at
last
ill
of
fever
and
my
recipe
for
fighting
the
heat
by
ceaseless
occupation
failed
it
was
a
miserable
day
and
at
one
time
a
scorching
wind
which
seemed
hot
enough
to
singe
one
hair
added
to
the
discomfort
as
the
hireling
earnestly
desireth
the
shadow
so
i
longed
for
evening
but
truly
the
hours
of
that
day
were
long
drawn
out
the
silence
was
singular
even
the
buzzing
of
a
fly
would
have
been
cheerful
the
sun
reddening
the
atmosphere
as
he
sank
disappeared
in
a
fiery
haze
and
then
the
world
of
daulatabad
awoke
parties
of
persian
gentlemen
on
fiery
horses
passed
by
dervishes
honoured
me
by
asking
alms
the
governor
called
to
offer
sundry
kindnesses
and
great
flocks
of
sheep
and
goats
indicated
by
long
lines
of
dust
clouds
moved
citywards
from
the
hills
in
legions
now
beset
me
and
the
earth
which
had
been
imbibing
heat
all
day
radiated
it
far
into
the
morning
i
moved
my
bed
outside
the
tent
and
gave
orders
for
an
early
start
but
the
who
was
in
the
city
himself
and
it
was
eight
the
next
day
before
i
got
away
taking
mirza
with
me
the
heat
culminated
on
that
day
since
then
having
attained
a
higher
altitude
it
has
diminished
the
road
to
jamilabad
ascends
pretty
steadily
through
undulating
country
with
small
valleys
among
low
hills
but
with
hardly
any
villages
owing
to
the
paucity
of
water
the
fever
still
continuing
i
found
it
difficult
to
bear
the
movement
of
the
horse
and
dismounted
two
or
three
times
and
lay
under
an
umbrella
by
the
roadside
on
one
of
these
halts
i
heard
mirza
voice
saying
in
cheerful
tones
madam
your
horse
is
gone
gone
i
exclaimed
i
told
you
always
to
hold
or
tether
him
i
trusted
him
he
replied
sententiously
never
trust
any
one
or
any
horse
and
least
of
all
yourself
i
replied
unadvisedly
i
sent
him
back
with
his
horse
to
look
for
telling
him
when
he
saw
him
to
dismount
and
go
towards
him
with
the
and
that
though
the
horse
would
approach
it
and
throw
up
his
heels
and
trot
away
at
first
he
would
eventually
come
near
enough
to
be
caught
after
half
an
hour
he
came
back
without
him
i
asked
him
what
he
had
done
he
said
he
saw
rode
near
him
twice
did
not
dismount
held
out
to
him
not
the
with
barley
but
my
and
that
cantered
out
of
sight
for
the
moment
i
shared
aziz
khan
contempt
for
the
man
mirza
is
so
good
that
one
can
not
be
angry
with
him
but
it
was
very
annoying
to
hear
him
preach
about
fate
and
destiny
while
he
was
allowing
his
horse
to
grind
my
one
pair
of
smoked
spectacles
into
bits
under
his
hoofs
i
only
told
him
that
it
would
be
time
to
fall
back
on
and
when
under
any
given
circumstances
such
as
these
he
had
exhausted
all
the
resources
of
forethought
and
intelligence
my
plight
was
a
sore
one
for
by
that
time
i
was
really
ill
and
had
lost
as
well
as
my
horse
and
saddle
my
food
quinine
writing
materials
and
i
got
on
the
top
of
the
baggage
and
rode
for
five
hours
twice
falling
off
from
exhaustion
the
march
instead
of
being
thirteen
miles
turned
out
there
was
no
water
poor
mirza
was
so
knocked
up
that
he
stumbled
blindly
along
and
it
was
just
sunset
when
after
a
series
of
gentle
ascents
we
reached
the
village
of
jamilabad
prettily
situated
on
the
crest
of
a
hill
in
a
narrow
valley
above
a
small
stream
to
acquaint
the
with
my
misfortune
and
get
him
to
send
a
capable
man
in
search
of
the
horse
promising
a
large
reward
and
to
despatch
hassan
with
a
guide
in
another
direction
were
the
first
considerations
and
so
it
fell
out
that
it
was
before
i
was
at
rest
in
my
tent
where
i
was
obliged
to
remain
for
some
days
ill
of
fever
the
next
morning
a
gentle
thump
a
low
snuffle
and
a
theft
of
some
grapes
by
my
bedside
announced
that
was
found
and
by
the
headman
messenger
who
said
he
met
a
seyyid
riding
him
to
hamadan
the
was
missing
and
all
the
things
from
the
holsters
but
after
the
emissary
had
been
arrested
for
some
crime
the
latter
were
found
in
his
large
pockets
hassan
returned
late
in
the
afternoon
having
been
surrounded
by
four
who
under
the
threat
of
giving
him
a
severe
beating
deprived
him
of
his
watch
when
i
was
so
far
better
as
to
be
able
to
move
i
went
on
to
mongawi
a
large
walled
village
at
an
elevation
of
feet
camped
for
two
days
on
an
adjacent
slope
and
from
thence
rode
to
yalpand
by
a
road
on
a
height
on
the
east
side
of
a
very
wild
valley
on
the
west
of
which
is
elwend
a
noble
mountain
for
long
an
object
of
interest
on
the
march
from
kirmanshah
to
tihran
a
great
number
of
the
mountains
of
persia
are
ridges
or
peaks
of
nearly
naked
rock
with
precipices
on
which
nothing
can
cling
and
with
bases
small
in
proportion
to
their
elevation
others
are
monstrous
protuberances
of
mud
and
gravel
mount
elwend
however
has
many
of
the
characteristics
of
a
mountain
a
huge
base
broken
up
into
glens
and
spurs
among
which
innumerable
villages
with
their
surroundings
of
woods
and
crops
are
scattered
with
streams
dashing
through
rifts
and
lingering
among
pasture
lands
slopes
below
and
tawny
grain
above
high
summits
even
now
clouds
caught
and
falling
in
vivifying
showers
indigo
colouring
in
the
shadows
and
rocky
heights
for
which
would
be
the
fittest
expression
in
one
of
the
loveliest
of
the
valleys
on
the
skirts
of
elwend
lies
the
large
walled
village
of
yalpand
on
a
vigorous
stream
for
two
miles
before
reaching
it
the
rugged
road
passes
through
a
glen
which
might
be
at
home
a
ledgy
track
by
trees
with
steep
small
fields
among
them
in
the
fresh
green
of
grass
springing
up
after
the
hay
has
been
carried
trees
ruddy
with
premature
autumnal
tints
and
festooned
with
roses
and
brambles
bend
over
the
river
of
which
little
is
visible
but
here
and
there
a
flash
of
foam
or
a
pool
the
village
on
a
height
above
the
stream
has
banks
of
orchards
below
and
miles
of
grain
above
and
vineyards
and
material
plenty
of
all
sorts
it
was
revelling
in
the
dust
storm
which
winnowing
produces
and
the
suggested
to
me
to
camp
at
some
distance
beyond
it
on
a
small
triangular
meadow
below
a
large
irrigation
stream
hardly
were
the
tents
pitched
when
nearly
without
warning
elwend
blackened
clouds
gathered
round
his
crest
and
boiled
up
out
of
his
corries
and
for
the
first
time
since
the
middle
of
january
there
were
six
hours
of
heavy
rain
with
hail
and
thunder
and
a
fall
of
the
mercury
within
one
hour
from
to
the
coolness
was
most
delicious
hadji
hussein
prophecy
that
after
i
left
him
i
should
know
what
are
was
not
fulfilled
on
this
journey
i
had
one
young
man
with
me
who
from
having
performed
the
pilgrimage
to
kerbela
bears
the
name
of
kerbelai
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
owns
the
fine
and
frisky
animals
he
drives
and
goes
along
at
a
good
pace
his
long
gun
over
his
shoulder
singing
as
he
goes
blithe
active
jolly
obliging
honest
he
loads
as
fast
as
three
ordinary
men
and
besides
grooming
and
feeding
his
animals
well
he
ran
messages
got
the
water
and
wood
and
helped
to
pitch
and
strike
the
tents
and
was
as
ready
to
halt
as
to
march
hassan
and
mirza
are
most
deliberate
in
their
movements
nothing
can
hurry
them
not
even
the
risk
of
being
flooded
out
of
their
tents
and
when
the
storm
came
on
kerbelai
snatched
the
spade
from
them
and
in
no
time
trenched
my
tent
and
dug
a
channel
to
let
the
water
out
of
the
meadow
the
next
day
was
cloudless
and
the
sky
instead
of
having
a
whitish
or
steely
blue
had
the
deep
pure
tint
so
often
seen
on
a
june
day
in
england
the
heat
returned
and
it
was
a
fatiguing
and
dusty
march
into
hamadan
still
mainly
on
the
skirts
of
elwend
among
villages
surrounded
by
vineyards
after
pursuing
a
from
jamilabad
i
joined
the
main
road
two
miles
from
hamadan
and
the
number
of
men
on
good
horses
of
foot
passengers
and
of
asses
laden
with
fruit
and
vegetables
indicated
the
approach
to
a
capital
as
plainly
as
the
wide
road
trenched
on
both
sides
and
planted
with
young
willows
the
wall
as
is
usual
is
of
crumbling
bricks
and
a
very
poor
gateway
admits
the
traveller
into
a
network
of
narrow
alleys
very
ruinous
with
infamous
roadways
full
of
lumps
holes
slimy
black
channels
stout
mangy
dogs
some
of
them
earless
tailless
and
sleeping
in
heaps
in
the
hot
sun
the
whole
overwhelmingly
malodorous
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
find
the
way
to
the
american
mission
house
even
though
the
missionary
is
well
known
and
highly
esteemed
and
i
rode
through
the
filthy
alleys
of
the
city
and
its
crowded
bazars
for
more
than
an
hour
before
i
reached
the
armenian
quarter
the
people
were
most
polite
there
was
no
shouting
or
crushing
in
the
bazars
and
in
some
cases
men
walked
with
me
for
some
distance
to
show
me
the
way
especially
when
i
asked
for
the
house
indeed
they
all
seemed
anxious
to
assist
a
stranger
many
of
the
children
salaamed
as
i
thought
but
i
have
since
heard
that
they
are
fond
of
using
to
a
christian
a
word
which
sounds
just
like
but
which
instead
of
meaning
is
equivalent
to
may
you
be
for
ever
accursed
on
reaching
the
mission
house
i
found
it
shut
and
that
the
missionaries
were
in
the
country
and
after
sending
word
that
i
had
arrived
i
spent
some
hours
in
an
armenian
house
where
the
people
showed
extreme
hospitality
and
kindness
they
put
a
soft
quilt
down
on
the
soft
rugs
which
covered
the
floor
of
a
pretty
whitewashed
room
with
many
ornaments
chiefly
russian
and
finding
that
i
was
ill
they
repeatedly
brought
tea
milk
and
fruit
instead
of
the
heavy
dinner
which
was
at
once
cooked
the
sight
of
several
comely
women
dressed
in
shades
of
red
with
clean
white
going
about
household
avocations
receiving
visitors
and
gracefully
exercising
the
rites
of
hospitality
in
a
bright
clean
house
festooned
with
vines
was
very
pleasant
to
a
dweller
in
tents
it
is
not
armenian
custom
for
a
to
speak
in
the
presence
of
her
or
even
to
uncover
her
mouth
or
for
young
women
to
speak
in
presence
of
their
elders
a
wife
can
not
even
address
her
husband
in
the
presence
of
his
mother
except
in
a
furtive
whisper
owing
to
the
custom
of
covering
the
mouth
which
shows
no
symptom
of
falling
into
disuse
i
did
not
see
the
face
of
a
girl
matron
who
judging
from
her
eyes
nose
and
complexion
was
the
comeliest
in
the
room
towards
evening
as
i
lay
trying
to
sleep
i
was
delightfully
startled
by
a
cheery
european
voice
and
a
lady
bent
over
me
whose
face
was
sunshine
and
the
very
tone
of
her
voice
a
welcome
goodness
purity
love
capacity
to
lead
as
well
as
help
true
strength
and
true
womanliness
met
in
the
expression
of
her
countenance
her
spotless
cambric
dress
her
becoming
hat
with
its
soft
white
the
harmonious
simplicity
of
her
costume
and
her
gloves
and
shoes
were
a
joy
after
the
slovenliness
slipshodness
and
generally
look
of
oriental
women
the
faith
hubbard
school
one
of
the
good
works
of
the
american
presbyterian
mission
was
close
by
and
in
half
an
hour
miss
made
me
feel
at
home
blessed
phrase
footnotes
on
this
journey
of
miles
from
burujird
to
the
turkish
frontier
near
urmi
i
never
heard
one
complaint
of
the
tribute
which
is
paid
to
the
shah
all
complaints
and
they
were
many
were
of
the
exactions
and
rapacity
of
the
local
governors
north
of
daulatabad
the
route
of
last
winter
from
nanej
to
kûm
the
winter
route
from
kangawar
to
tihran
was
crossed
although
it
is
a
beaten
track
for
caravans
so
far
as
i
know
the
only
information
concerning
it
consists
in
two
reports
not
accessible
to
the
public
in
the
possession
of
the
indian
authorities
hamadan
is
the
fourth
city
in
the
empire
in
commercial
importance
she
has

as
the
ancient

she
has
a
splendid
history
but
the
few
lines
in
which
i
recorded
my
first
impressions
are
not
an
exaggeration
of
the
meanness
and
unsavouriness
of
her
present
externals
letter
xxiii
hamadan
i
came
for
four
days
and
have
been
here
nearly
three
weeks
which
i
would
willingly
prolong
into
as
many
months
if
the
winter
were
not
impending

the
of

containing
winter
clothing
from

and
the
exceeding
difficulty
of
finding
a
willing

go
to
urmi
by
the
route
i
wish
to
take
have
all
detained
me
for
some
time
i
was
unable
to
leave
the
house
and
indeed
have
been
out
very
little
and
not
outside
the
city
at
all
i
am
disappointed
both
with
hamadan
and
its
autumn
climate
it
stands
at
an
elevation
of
feet
schindler
and
on
the
final
slope
of
the
an
offshoot
of
mount
elwend
overlooking
a
plain
about
fifteen
miles
long
by
nine
broad
populous
and
cultivated
bounded
on
the
other
side
by
low
gravelly
hills
at
this
altitude
and
with
autumn
fairly
begun
coolness
might
be
expected
but
the
heat
which
a
fortnight
ago
seemed
moderating
has
returned
in
fury
with
that
peculiar
faintness
about
it
which
only
autumn
gives
mount
elwend
attracts
masses
of
clouds
and
these
tend
to
hang
over
the
town
and
increase
the
stagnation
of
the
air
about
which
there
is
a
remarkable
closeness
even
in
this
high
situation
overlooking
the
plain
intermittent
fever
and
diphtheria
are
prevailing
both
in
the
city
and
the
adjacent
villages
not
only
is
the
air
close
and
still
but
the
sun
is
blazing
hot
and
the
mercury
only
varies
from
in
the
day
to
at
night
brown

wildly
over
the
plain
or

heavily
over
it
in

and
the
are
abundant
and
merciless
in
the
winter
the
cold
is
intense
and
the
roads
are
usually
blocked
with
snow
for
several
weeks
water
is
abundant
and
is
led
through
open
channels
in
the
streets
the
plain
too
is
well
supplied
and
the
brown
villages
which
otherwise
would
be
invisible
on
the
brown
plain
are
denoted
by
dark
green
stains
of
willow
poplar
and
fruit
trees
the

has
fine
gardens
belonging
to
the
upper
classes
but
these
are
only
indicated
by
branches
straying
over
the
top
of
very
high
walls
my
first
impressions
have
received
abundant
confirmation
important
as
a
commercial
centre
as
hamadan
doubtless
is
it
is
as
ruinous
filthy
decayed
and
a
city
as
any
i
have
seen
in
persia
ruinous
heaps
jagged
walls
houses
in
ruins
or
partly
ruined
and
deserted
roofs
broken
through
domes
from
which
the
glazed
tiles
have
dropped
off
roadways
not
easy
by
daylight
and
dangerous
at
night
leaking
into
the
roads
and
often
black
with
slime
and
an
unusual
number
of
very
poor
and
people
going
about
are
not
evidences
of
the
prosperity
which
in
spite
of
these
untoward
appearances
really
exists
the
high
mud
walls
along
the
alleys
have
no
windows
in
order
that
the
women
may
not
see
or
be
seen
by
men
a
doorway
with
a
outside
it
in
houses
admits
into
a
vaulted
recess
from
which
a
passage
dimly
lighted
conducts
into
the
courtyard
round
which
the
house
is
built
or
into
the
house
itself
these
courtyards
are
planted
with
trees
and
flowers
marigolds
and
autumnal
roses
being
now
in
the
ascendant
marble
basins
with
fountains
and
marble
walks
between
the
parterres
suggest
coolness
and
walnuts
apples
and
apricots
give
shade
the
men
and
apartments
are
frequently
on
opposite
sides
of
the
quadrangles
and
the
latter
usually
open
on
floored
with
white
marble
and
furnished
with
rugs
and
brocaded
curtains
i
have
only
seen
the
women
apartments
and
these
in
the
houses
of
rich
traders
and
high
officials
are
as
ornamental
as
the
exteriors
are
repulsive
and
destitute
of
ornament
gilding
arabesques
in
colour
fretwork
doors
and
panelling
and
ceilings
and
cornices
composed
of
small
mirrors
arranged
so
as
to
represent
facets
are
all
decorative
in
the
extreme
these
houses
with
the
deep
shade
of
their
courtyards
the
cool
plash
of
their
fountains
and
their
spacious
and
rooms
contrast
everywhere
with
the
low
dark
mud
hovels
unplastered
and
windowless
in
which
the
poor
live
and
which
the
women
can
only
escape
from
by
sitting
in
the
heaped
and
filthy
yards
on
which
they
open
and
which
the
inhabitants
share
with
their
animals
the
contrast
between
wealth
and
poverty
is
strongly
emphasised
in
this
as
in
all
persian
cities
but
one
must
add
that
the
gulf
between
rich
and
poor
is
bridged
by
constant
benevolence
on
the
part
of
the
rich
profuse
charity
being
practised
as
a
work
of
merit
by
all
good
moslems
the
bazars
are
shabby
and
partially
ruinous
but
very
well
supplied
with
native
produce
and
manufactures

and
of
various
descriptions
the
presence
of
foreigners
in
the
town
although
they
import
many
things
by
way
of
baghdad
has
introduced
foreign
articles
of
utility
into
the
bazars
which
are
not
to
be
found
everywhere
and
which
are
commending
themselves
to
the
people
peek

the
display
of
fruit
just
now
is
very
fine
especially
of
grapes
and

the
best
peaches
which
are
large
and
of
delicious
flavour
as
well
as
the
best
pears

from
the
beautiful
orchards
of

are
singularly
well
supplied

they
should
be

is
famous
for
leather

caravans
loaded
with

for
its

are
met
with
on

is
also
famous
for

felts
which
are
used
as
carpets

and
as
greatcoats
by
the
peasants
as
well
as
by
the

a

are
made
to

valuable

are
laid
over

the
largest
i
have
seen
is
in
the
palace
of
the
minister
of
justice
at
tihran
which
must
be
fully
a
hundred

not
an

in

paler
shade
of

beaten
into
the

to
their
bulk
and

are
never
exported
the
best
made
at
hamadan
are
about
the
square
yard
chairs
spoil
them
and
as
it
is
becoming
fashionable
among
the
rich
men
of
the
cities
to
wear
tight
trousers
which
bring
chairs
in
their
train
the
manufacture
of
these
magnificent
will
probably
die
the
felt
coats
which
protect
equally
from
rain
and
cold
are
dark
brown
and
seamless
and
cost
from

have
sleeves
closed

hamadan
is
also
famous
for
and
makes
and
dyes
cottons
the
tanneries
and
the
between
them
create
a
stench
which
is
perceptible
for
miles
the
neighbourhood
produces
much
wine
white
like
hock
and
red
like
claret
both
being
harsh
and

the
armenians
are
the
chief
makers
and
sellers
of
wine
i
wish
i
could
add
that
they
are
the
only
people
who
get
drunk
but
this
is
not
the
case
for
from
the
prince
governor
downwards
among
the
rich
moslems
intemperance
has
become
common
and
even
many
young
men
are
going
to
wreck
with
drink
sacrificing
the
virtue
to
which
moslems
have
been
able
to
point
with
pride
as
differentiating
them
from
christians
i
was
unable
to
return
the
prince
governor
visit
and
courtesies
in
accordance
with
the
etiquette
for
a
european
lady
traveller
because
of
the
helpless
condition
in
which
he
and
a
party
of
convivial
friends
were
found
by
the
messenger
sent
by
me
to
ask
him
to
appoint
an
hour
for
my
visit
raisins
treacle
and
are
also
manufactured
the
rich
prefer
to
it
is
rather
than
which
is
sapping
the
life
of
the
moslems
of
hamadan
it
is
singular
that
in
this
ecbatana
the
capital
of
greater
media
there
should
be
so
very
few
remains
of
an
ancient
greatness
and
splendour
just
outside
the
town
a
low
eminence
called
musala
is
pointed
out
as
the
site
of
the
palace
of
the
median
kings
but
even
this
is
doubtful
coins
of
an
ancient
date
are
both
dug
up
and
fabricated
by
the
jews
only
two
really
interesting
objects
remain
and
the
antiquity
of
one
of
these
is
not
universally
accepted
the
tomb
of
queen
esther
and
her
uncle
mordecai
is
the
great
of
hamadan
and
is
held
in
much
veneration
by
the
jews
of
turkey
and
persia
who
resort
to
it
on
pilgrimage
the
jews
are
its
custodians
illustration
tomb
of
esther
and
mordecai
this
tomb
consists
of
an
outer
and
inner
chamber
surmounted
by
a
mean
dome
about
fifty
feet
in
height
the
blue
tiles
with
which
it
was
covered
have
nearly
all
dropped
off
the
outer
chamber
in
which
there
are
a
few
tombs
of
jews
who
have
been
counted
worthy
of
burial
near
the
shrine
is
entered
by
a
very
low
door
and
the
shrine
itself
by
one
still
lower
through
which
one
is
obliged
to
creep
the
inner
chamber
is
vaulted
and
floored
with
blue
tiles
and
having
been
recently
restored
is
in
good
order
under
the
dome
which
is
lighted
with
the
smoky
clay
lamps
used
by
the
very
poor
are
the
two
tombs
each
covered
with
a
carved
wooden
ark
much
defaced
and
evidently
of
great
antiquity
there
is
an
entrance
to
the
tombs
below
these
arks
and
each
is
lighted
by
an
lamp
there
is
nothing
in
the
shrine
but
a
hebrew
old
testament
and
a
quantity
of
pieces
of
paper
inscribed
with
hebrew
characters
which
are
affixed
by
pilgrims
to
the
woodwork
the
tombs
and
the
tradition
concerning
them
are
of
such
great
antiquity
that
i
gladly
accept
the
verdict
of
those
who
assign
them
to
the
beautiful
and
patriotic
queen
and
her
capable
uncle
on
the
dome
is
this
inscription
on
thursday
the
of
the
month
adar
in
the
year
of
the
creation
of
the
world
the
building
of
this
temple
over
the
tombs
of
mordecai
and
esther
was
finished
by
the
hands
of
the
two
benevolent
brothers
elias
and
samuel
sons
of
ismail
kachan
the
other
object
of
interest
which
has
been
carefully
described
by
sir
rawlinson
and
sir
layard
is
specially
remarkable
as
having
afforded
the
key
to
the
decipherment
of
the
cuneiform
character
it
is
in
the
mountains
above
hamadan
and
consists
of
two
tablets
six
feet
six
inches
by
eight
feet
six
inches
layard
cut
in
a
red
granite
cliff
which
closes
the
end
of
a
corrie
there
are
other
tablets
near
them
carefully
prepared
but
never
used
the
three
inscriptions
are
in
parallel
columns
in
the
three
languages
spoken
in
the
once
vast
persian
empire
persian
median
and
babylonian
and
contain
invocations
to
ormuzd
and
the
names
and
titles
of
darius
hystaspes
and
his
son
xerxes
amidst
the
meanness
not
to
say
squalor
of
modern
hamadan
no
legerdemain
of
the
imagination
can
the
once
magnificent
ecbatana
said
by
the
early
greek
writers
to
have
been
scarcely
inferior
to
babylon
in
size
and
splendour
with
walls
covered
with
plates
of
gold
and
fortifications
of
enormous
strength
the
capital
of
arbaces
after
the
fall
of
nineveh
and
the
summer
resort
of
the
great
king
according
to
xenophon
the
jews
are
supposed
to
number
from
to
souls
and
are
in
the
lowest
state
of
degradation
morally
and
socially
that
bad
act
of
sarah
in
casting
out
the
bondwoman
and
her
son
is
certainly
avenged
upon
her
descendants
they
are
daily
kicked
beaten
and
spat
upon
in
the
streets
and
their
children
are
pelted
and
beaten
in
going
to
and
from
the
school
which
the
americans
have
established
for
them
redress
for
any
wrongs
is
inaccessible
to
them
they
are
regarded
as
inferior
to
dogs
so
degraded
are
they
that
they
have
not
even
spirit
to
take
advantage
of
the
help
which
american
influence
would
give
them
to
get
into
a
better
position
the
accursed
vices
of
low
greed
and
low
cunning
are
fully
developed
in
them
they
get
their
living
by
usury
by
the
making
and
selling
of
wine
and
by
the
sale
of
adulterated
drugs
by
peddling
in
the
villages
and
by
doing
generally
the
mean
and
dishonest
work
from
which
their
oppressors
shrink
many
of
them
have
become
moslems
the
law
being
that
a
convert
to
islam
can
take
away
the
whole
property
of
his
family
a
larger
number
have
it
is
believed
joined
the
secret
sect
of
the
i
never
heard
such
a
sickening
account
of
degradation
as
is
given
of
the
hamadan
jews
by
those
who
know
them
best
and
have
worked
the
most
earnestly
for
their
welfare
there
are
a
number
of
armenians
in
hamadan
and
several
villages
in
the
district
are
inhabited
exclusively
by
them
there
are
also
villages
with
a
mixed
persian
and
armenian
population
they
all
speak
persian
and
the
men
at
least
are
scarcely
to
be
distinguished
from
persians
by
their
dress
they
are
not
in
any
way
oppressed
and
except
during
occasional
outbreaks
of
moslem
fanaticism
are
on
very
good
terms
with
their
neighbours
they
live
in
a
separate
quarter
and
both
gregorians
and
protestants
exercise
their
religion
without
molestation
they
excel
in
various
trades
specially
carpentering
and
working
in
metals
their
position
in
hamadan
is
improving
and
this
may
be
attributed
in
part
to
the
education
given
in
the
american
high
school
for
boys
and
to
the
residence
among
them
of
the
american
missionaries
who
have
come
to
be
regarded
as
their
natural
protectors
the
population
of
hamadan
is
an
unknown
quantity
it
probably
does
not
exceed
and
has
undoubtedly
decreased
seyyids
and
form
a
considerable
proportion
of
it
and
it
is
one
of
the
strongholds
of
the
it
is
usually
an
orderly
city
and
european
ladies
wearing
gauze
veils
and
properly
attended
can
pass
through
it
both
by
day
and
night
several
parts
of
it
are
enclosed
by
gates
as
at
canton
open
only
from
sunrise
to
sunset
an
arrangement
which
is
supposed
to
be
conducive
to
security

hamadan
i
am
visiting
the
three
lady
teachers
of
the
faith
hubbard
boarding
school
for
girls
and
the
visit
is
an
oasis
on
my
journey
it
is
a
most
cheerful
house
a
perfect
hive
of
industry
each
one
being
occupied
with
things
which
are
worth
doing
i
can
not
say
how
kind
and
how
helpful
they
have
all
been
to
me
and
with
what
regret
i
am
leaving
them
the
house
is
large
plain
airy
and
thoroughly
sanitary
very
well
situated
with
an
open
view
over
the
hamadan
plain
it
is
closely
surrounded
by
the
houses
of
the
armenian
quarter
and
all
those
domestic
operations
which
are
performed
on
the
roofs
in
hot
weather
are
easily
studied
such
as
the
drying
of
clothes
and
herbs
the
cleaning
of
heads
the
beating
of
children
the
bringing
out
of
beds
at
night
and
the
rolling
them
up
in
the
morning
the
going
to
bed
of
families
much
bundled
up
the
performance
of
the
very
limited
ablutions
which
constitute
the
morning
toilette
and
the
making
and
mending
of
clothes
the
roof
being
for
many
months
both
and
bedroom
at
sunset
as
in
all
persian
towns
a
great
hush
falls
on
hamadan
only
people
who
have
business
are
seen
in
the
streets
the
bazars
are
closed
and
from
sunset
to
sunrise
there
would
be
complete
silence
were
it
not
for
the
yelping
and
howling
of
the
scavenger
dogs
and
the
long
melancholy
call
to
prayer
from
the
minarets
if
it
is
necessary
to
go
out
at
night
a
person
of
either
sex
is
preceded
by
a
servant
carrying
a
lantern
near
the
ground
these
lanterns
have
metal
tops
and
bottoms
and
waxed
wired
muslin
between
which
is
ingeniously
arranged
to
fold
up
flat
they
are
usually
three
feet
long
but
may
be
of
any
diameter
and
as
your
consideration
is
evidenced
by
the
size
of
your
lantern
there
is
a
tendency
to
carry
about
huge
transparencies
which
undulate
very
agreeably
in
the
darkness
this
is
the
moharrem
or
month
of
mourning
for
hassan
and
houssein
the
slain
sons
of
ali
who
are
regarded
by
the
shiahs
as
the
rightful
successors
of
the
prophet
and
as
the
noblest
martyrs
in
the
calendar
during
this
period
the
whole
persian
community
goes
into
deep
mourning
and
the
streets
and
bazars
are
filled
with
black
dresses
only
in
this
month
is
acted
throughout
the
empire
the
or
passion
play
which
has
for
its
climax
the
tragic
deaths
of
these
two
men
i
arrived
in
hamadan
on
what
should
have
been
the
first
day
of
moharrem
but
there
had
been
a
difference
of
opinion
among
the
as
to
the
date
and
it
was
postponed
to
the
next
day
for
me
a
most
fortunate
circumstance
as
no
christian
ought
to
be
seen
in
the
streets
at
a
time
when
they
are
filled
with
excited
throngs
frenzied
by
religious
fanaticism
on
the
following
day
the
quiet
of
the
city
was
interrupted
by
singular
cries
and
by
children
voices
high
pitched
singing
a
chant
so
strange
and
weird
that
one
both
longs
and
dreads
to
hear
it
repeated
the
christians
kept
within
their
houses
business
was
suspended
bands
of
boys
carrying
black
flags
perambulated
the
town
singing
one
of
the
chants
of
the
passion
play
as
night
came
on
it
was
possible
to
feel
the
throb
of
the
excitement
of
the
city
and
till
the
small
hours
the
march
of
frenzied
processions
was
heard
and
the
loud
smiting
on
human
breasts
and
the
clash
of
the
chains
with
which
the
dervishes
beat
themselves
were
intermingled
with
a
united
rhythmic
cry
of
anguish
houssein
wai
houssein
o
houssein
woe

frenzied

beating

of

these

are

sickening
spectacle

to

frenzy
with
which
the
different
incidents
are
received
culminating
on
the
last
day
when
the
slaughter
of
houssein
is
represented
on
the
whole
the
is
among
the
most
remarkable
religious
phenomena
of
our
age
under
the
rule
of
the
present
prince
governor
complete
religious
toleration
exists
in
hamadan
and
the
missionaries
have
a
fair
field
though
it
must
never
be
forgotten
that
a
christian
rendering
honour
to
christ
as
god
by
his
mere
presence
introduces
a
disturbing
element
into
a
moslem
population
in
consequence
of
this
tolerant
official
spirit
there
are
a
few
moslem
girls
among
the
sixty
boarders
here
in
addition
there
are
a
large
number
of
day
pupils
the
girls
live
in
native
fashion
and
wear
native
dresses
of
red
cotton
printed
with
white
patterns
white
and
such
ornaments
as
they
possess
they
sit
on
the
floor
at
their
meals
at
each
of
which
one
of
the
ladies
is
present
they
have
excellent
food
meat
once
a
day
in
summer
and
twice
in
winter
bread
tea
soup
curds
cheese
melons
cucumbers
pickles
and
gourds
the
winter
supplies
are
now
being
laid
in
and
caravans
of
asses
are
arriving
daily
with
firewood
cheeses
and
melons
the
elder
girls
cook
and
all
the
washing
making
and
mending
are
done
at
home
each
elder
girl
in
addition
having
a
small
family
of
young
ones
under
her
care
the
only
servant
is
the
or
the
dormitories
and
are
large
and
well
ventilated
but
very
simple
a
plain
but
thorough
education
of
the
national
school
type
is
given
in
combination
with
an
industrial
training
fitted
for
girls
whose
early
destiny
is
wifehood
and
maternity
some
of
the
teachers
are
men
but
the
religious
instruction
on
which
great
stress
is
laid
is
given
by
the
ladies
themselves
and
is
made
singularly
interesting
and
attractive
music
and
singing
are
regarded
as
among
the
recreations
the
discipline
is
perfect
and
the
dirtiest
roughest
lumpiest
and
most
refractory
raw
material
is
quickly
transformed
into
cleanliness
brightness
and
docility
partly
by
the
tone
of
the
school
and
the
influence
of
the
girls
who
have
been
trained
in
it
but
chiefly
by
the
influence
of
love
the
respect
with
which
the
office
of
a
teacher
is
regarded
in
the
east
allows
of
much
more
familiarity
than
would
be
possible
with
us
out
of
school
hours
the
ladies
are
accessible
at
all
times
even
to
the
youngest
children
many
a
little
childish
trouble
finds
its
way
to
their
maternal
sympathies
and
they
are
just
as
ready
to
give
advice
about
the
colour
and
making
of
dolls
clothes
as
about
more
important
matters
the
loving
cheerful
atmosphere
of
an
english
home
pervades
the
school
i
write
english
rather
than
american
because
the
ladies
are
prince
edward
islanders
and
british
subjects
some
of
the
girls
who
have
been
trained
here
are
well
married
and
make
good
wives
and
the
school
bids
fair
to
be
resorted
to
in
the
future
by
young
men
who
desire
companionship
as
well
as
domestic
accomplishments
in
their
wives
the
ordinary
uneducated
armenian
woman
is
a
very
stupid
lump
very
inferior
to
the
persian
woman
of
the
effect
of
the
simple
loving
practical
christian
training
given
and
enforced
by
the
beauty
of
example
it
is
easy
to
write
for
not
only
some
of
the
girls
who
have
left
the
school
but
many
who
are
now
in
it
show
by
the
purity
gentleness
lovingness
and
of
their
lives
that
they
have
learned
to
follow
the
master
a
lesson
the
wise
teaching
of
which
is
or
should
be
i
think
the
of
every
mission
school
christianity
thus
translated
into
homely
lives
may
come
to
be
the
disinfectant
which
will
purify
in
time
the
deep
corruption
of
persian
life
the
cost
of
this
school
under
its
capable
and
liberal
management
is
surprising
only
per
head
per
annum
its
weak
point
but
at
present
it
seems
an
inevitable
blemish
is
that
the
board
and
education
are
gratuitous
there
is
a
high
school
for
boys
largely
attended
under
the
charge
of
watson
the
clerical
missionary
with
an
armenian
principal
karapit
educated
in
the
school
in
julfa
a
very
able
man
and
he
is
assisted
by
several
teachers
there
is
also
a
large
school
of
jewish
girls
who
are
often
maltreated
on
their
way
to
and
from
it
there
are
a
flourishing
medical
mission
and
dispensary
under
alexander
charge
with
a
hospital
nearly
finished
for
the
more
serious
cases
there
is
another
dispensary
at
sheverin
and
both
there
and
here
the
number
of
patients
is
large
a
small
charge
is
made
for
medicines
mirza
a
medical
student
of
mature
years
and
remarkable
capacities
occasionally
itinerates
in
the
distant
villages
and
being
a
learned
scholar
in
the
koran
holds
religious
disputations
after
his
medical
work
is
done
he
was
a
moslem
and
having
embraced
christianity
preaches
its
doctrines
with
much
force
and
enthusiasm
he
is
popular
in
hamadan
and
much
thought
of
by
the
governor
in
spite
of
his
perversion
he
also
gives
addresses
on
christianity
to
the
patients
who
assemble
at
the
dispensary
any
person
is
at
liberty
to
withdraw
during
this
religious
service
but
few
avail
themselves
of
the
permission
miss
speaks
on
christianity
to
the
female
patients
at
sheverin
and
befriends
them
in
their
own
homes
the
day
work
here
begins
at
six
and
is
not
over
till
an
english
class
for
young
men
is
held
early
after
which
people
on
business
and
visitors
of
all
sorts
and
creeds
are
arriving
and
departing
all
day
and
all
are
welcome
on
one
day
i
counted
and
there
were
many
more
than
these
the
upper
class
of
persian
women
announce
their
visits
beforehand
and
usually
arrive
on
horseback
with
attendants
to
clear
the
way
no
must
enter
the
room
with
tea
or
anything
else
during
their
visits
the
armenian
women
call
at
all
hours
and
the
jewish
women
in
large
bands
without
previous
announcement
tea
la
is
provided
for
all
and
ibrahim
goes
to
the
door
and
counts
the
shoes
left
outside
in
order
to
know
how
many
to
provide
for
he
exclaimed
one
day
after
this
inspection
there
are
at
least
twenty
of
them
some
call
out
of
politeness
or
real
friendliness
others
to
see
the
the
sights
of
the
house
many
from
the
villages
to
talk
about
their
children
and
some
of
the
jewish
women
who
have
become
ask
to
have
the
new
testament
read
to
them
in
the
hope
of
hearing
something
which
they
may
use
in
the
propagation
of
their
new
faith
a
good
many
women
have
called
on
me
out
of
politeness
to
my
hostesses
persian
gentlemen
invariably
send
the
day
before
to
know
if
a
visit
can
be
conveniently
received
and
on
these
occasions
the
ladies
always
secure
the
of
one
of
the
men
missionaries
the
has
orders
not
to
turn
any
one
away
and
it
is
a
blessing
when
sunset
comes
and
the
stream
of
visitors
ceases
all
meet
with
a
genial
reception
and
the
ladies
usually
succeed
not
only
in
lifting
the
conversation
out
of
the
customary
frivolous
grooves
but
in
awaking
more
or
less
interest
in
the
religion
which
they
are
here
to
propagate
they
are
missionaries
first
and
everything
else
afterwards
and
miss
partly
because
of
her
goodness
and
benevolence
to
all
and
partly
because
of
an
uncompromising
honesty
in
her
religious
beliefs
which
the
people
thoroughly
appreciate
has
a
remarkable
influence
in
hamadan
and
is
universally
respected
her
jollity
and
sense
of
humour
are
a
great
help
she
thoroughly
enjoys
making
people
laugh
i
have
never
been
in
any
place
in
which
the
relations
with
moslems
have
been
so
easy
and
friendly
the
reza
khan
told
me
it
would
be
a
matter
of
regret
to
all
except
a
few
fanatics
if
the
ladies
were
to
leave
the
city
from
the
prince
governor
downwards
courtesy
and
kindness
are
shown
to
them
and
their
philanthropic
and
educational
work
is
approved
in
the
highest
quarters
though
they
never
blink
the
fact
that
they
are
proselytisers
there
is
an
armenian
protestant
congregation
with
a
native
pastor
and
a
fine
church
and
nothing
shows
more
plainly
the
toleration
which
prevails
in
hamadan
than
the
number
of
moslems
to
be
seen
every
sunday
at
the
morning
service
which
is
in
persian
in
this
church
total
abstinence
is
a
term
of
communion
and
unfermented
wine
is
used
in
the
celebration
of
the
eucharist
this
wine
is
very
delicious
and
has
the
full
flavour
and
aroma
of
the
fresh
grape
even
after
being
three
years
in
bottle
it
is
not
boiled
as
much
unfermented
wine
is
here
but
the
grapes
are
put
into
a
coarse
bag
through
which
the
juice
drops
without
pressure
the
gluten
being
retained
by
the
bag
fermentation
does
not
take
place
and
a
bottle
of
the
juice
even
if
left
without
a
cork
retains
its
excellence
till
it
dries
up
september
à
nos
the
in
this
instance
being
my
travelling
arrangements
three
roads
go
to
urmi
from
hamadan
one
the
usual
caravan
route
tabriz
the
commercial
capital
of
persia
and
round
the
north
end
of
lake
urmi
very
long
but
safe
another
called
the
kurdistan
route
which
no
will
take
by
reason
of
its
danger
and
a
third
by
sujbul
k
the
capital
of
persian
kurdistan
twenty
marches
only
five
of
which
are
reported
as
risky
i
decided
on
the
last
but
it
was
only
two
days
ago
that
i
was
able
to
get
a
willing
to
undertake
the
journey
it
is
too
late
they
say
there
are
robbers
on
the
road
they
do
know
the
way
or
provender
is
dear
or
snow
will
come
on
before
they
can
return
kerbelai
the
excellent
fellow
who
brought
my
loads
from
burujird
wished
to
go
and
i
engaged
him
gladly
but
afterwards
his
father
came
and
declared
he
could
not
let
him
go
for
he
did
not
know
the
way
and
would
be
robbed
another
man
was
engaged
but
never
reappeared
soon
after
i
came
a
tall
rich
turk
the
owner
of
sixty
mules
applied
for
the
engagement
and
we
think
that
by
certain
underhand
proceedings
familiar
to
the
persian
mind
he
has
driven
off
other
competitors
and
made
himself
my
last
resource
i
engaged
him
on
saturday
and
the
mules
and
mirza
went
off
this
morning
an
agreement
was
drawn
up
in
persian
and
english
placing
five
mules
my
absolute
to
halt
or
march
as
i
desire
at
thirteen
pence
a
day
each
so
long
as
i
want
them
with
two
men
handing
over
the
mules
and
men
to
me
till
i
reach
urmi
which
arrival
is
to
suit
my
own
convenience
this
was
read
over
twice
and
the
turk
sealed
it
in
presence
of
four
witnesses
all
his
other
mules
are
going
with
loads
to
urmi
and
this
accounts
for
his
great
desire
to
send
the
five
with
me
i
have
expressly
stipulated
that
i
am
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
big
caravan
but
am
to
take
my
own
time
this
turk
has
good
looks
and
plausible
manners
and
the
animals
have
sound
backs
but
i
distrust
him
the
servant
difficulty
which
threatened
to
keep
me
here
indefinitely
is
also
adjusted
hassan
left
me
when
i
arrived
being
unwilling
to
go
to
the
north
of
persia
so
late
and
he
bought
a
new
opium
pipe
saying
that
he
can
not
bear
the
pain
and
craving
of
being
without
it
he
was
a
fair
travelling
servant
for
a
persian
not
unreasonably
dishonest
and
i
am
sorry
to
lose
him
in
the
attempt
to
replace
him
a
maze
of
lies
fraud
and
underhand
dealing
has
been
passed
through
i
have
at
last
engaged
johannes
a
young
armenian
speaking
turkish
and
persian
besides
armenian
he
has
never
served
europeans
but
has
learned
baking
and
the
wine
trade
he
looks
much
of
a
cub
for
appearance
sake
i
have
armed
him
with
a
long
gun
he
and
mirza
are
alike
incompetent
to
make
any
travelling
arrangements
or
overcome
any
difficulties
to
discover
where
escorts
are
needed
and
where
they
may
be
dispensed
with
or
to
meet
any
emergencies
and
as
persian
will
be
considerably
replaced
by
turki
mirza
will
be
of
less
and
less
use
as
an
interpreter
i
can
not
get
any
recent
information
about
the
route
and
very
little
at
all
i
see
endless
difficulties
ahead
and
a
prospect
of
illustrating
in
my
own
experience
the
often
dinned
into
my
ears
that
no
lady
ought
to
travel
alone
in
persia
this
will
be
my
last
opportunity
of
posting
a
letter
for
nearly
a
month
the
persian
post
is
only
exceeded
in
unreliability
by
the
persian
telegraph
to
register
letters
is
the
only
way
of
securing
their
safe
arrival
and
it
is
necessary
to
send
a
trustworthy
man
to
the
post
offices
who
after
seeing
the
effacing
stamp
put
upon
the
postage
stamp
will
further
insist
upon
seeing
the
postmaster
put
the
letters
in
the
bag
in
tihran
the
europeans
make
much
use
of
the
legation
bags
and
the
merchants
prefer
to
trust
their
letters
to
private
rather
than
to
the
post
while
at
isfahan
people
are
often
glad
to
send
their
letters
by
the
monthly
telegraph
rather
than
run
a
postal
risk
however
a
foreign
letter
registered
is
pretty
safe
the
telegraph
is
worse
you
often
have
to
bribe
the
telegraph
clerk
to
send
the
message
and
unless
you
see
it
sent
it
will
probably
be
destroyed
of
five
messages
sent
by
me
from
hamadan
one
was
returned
because
the
british
agent
in
isfahan
was
not
known
two
were
slower
than
letters
sent
the
same
day
the
fourth
took
a
week
and
of
the
fifth
there
is
no
information
even
in
this
important
commercial
city
the
post
office
is
only
open
for
a
short
time
on
two
days
in
the
week
footnotes
for
a
detailed
and
most
interesting
account
of
these
remarkable
representations
the
reader
is
referred
to
benjamin
and
the
chap
xiii
since
i
returned
i
have
been
asked
more
than
once
what
are
the
results
of
missions
in
hamadan
among
those
which
appear
on
the
surface
are
the
spiritual
enlightenment
of
a
number
of
persons
whose
minds
were
blinded
by
the
gross
and
childish
superstitions
and
the
inconceivable
ignorance
into
which
the
ancient
church
of
gregory
the
illuminator
has
fallen
the
raising
of
a
higher
standard
of
morals
among
the
armenians
so
that
a
decided
stigma
is
coming
to
be
attached
to
drunkenness
and
other
vices
the
bringing
the
whole
of
the
rising
generation
of
armenians
under
influences
which
in
all
respects
make
for
righteousness
the
elevation
of
a
large
number
of
women
into
being
the
companions
and
helps
rather
than
the
drudges
of
men
the
bestowing
upon
boys
an
education
which
fits
them
for
any
positions
to
which
they
may
aspire
in
persia
and
elsewhere
and
creates
a
taste
for
intellectual
pursuits
the

letter
xxv
gaukhaud
this
is
a
difficult
journey
the
road
is
rarely
traversed
by
europeans
the
marches
are
long
and
i
am
really
not
well
enough
to
travel
at
all
not
having
been
able
to
shake
off
the
fever
cooler
days
and
cold
nights
are
however
coming
to
the
rescue
my
hamadan
friends
gave
me
a
a
parting
escort
miss
m
watson
pastor
ovannes
and
his
boy
all
on
horseback
watson
and
her
baby
on
an
ass
several
servants
on
foot
and
miss
m
and
alexander
in
a
spidery
american
buggy
with
a
pair
of
horses
alexander
a
man
six
feet
two
inches
high
and
very
thin
riding
postilion
on
one
of
them
to
get
the
buggy
over
difficult
places
ibrahim
the
ladies
with
a
gun
slung
behind
him
following
on
horseback
two
of
the
ladies
and
the
native
pastor
stayed
at
night
it
was
not
a
pleasant
return
to
camp
life
for
johannes
is
quite
ignorant
of
it
and
everything
was
at
sixes
and
sevens
nor
was
the
first
morning
pleasant
for
the
head
sharban
came
speaking
loud
with
vehement
gesticulation
saying
that
if
i
did
not
march
with
the
big
caravan
and
halt
when
it
did
they
would
only
give
me
one
man
and
added
sundry
other
threats
miss
m
scolded
him
reminding
them
of
their
agreement
and
ibrahim
told
them
that
if
they
violated
it
in
the
way
they
threatened
they
would
have
to
eat
more
wood
than
they
had
ever
eaten
in
their
lives
on
going
back
to
hamadan
eating
wood
is
the
phrase
for
being
bastinadoed
a
squabble
the
first
morning
is
a
usual
occurrence
and
miss
m
thought
it
would
be
all
right
and
advised
me
to
go
on
to
kooltapa
the
first
stage
put
down
by
the
cultivation
extends
over
the
eight
miles
from
hamadan
to
bahar
there
are
streams
and
willows
and
various
hamlets
with
much
wood
and
bahar
is
completely
buried
in
orchards
and
poplars
it
is
a
place
of
people
and
has
houses
small
mosques
and
schools
it
makes
thin
carpets
and
grows
besides
wheat
barley
cotton
and
oil
seeds
an
immense
quantity
of
fruit
which
has
a
ready
market
in
the
city
miss
m
and
pastor
ovannes
escorted
me
for
the
first
mile
and
meeting
the
caravan
on
their
way
back
gave
sharban
a
parting
exhortation
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
sight
he
sent
back
one
man
and
in
spite
of
mirza
remonstrances
drove
my
with
the
big
caravan
a
grievance
to
start
with
as
his
baggage
animals
were
so
heavily
loaded
that
they
could
not
go
even
two
miles
an
hour
and
i
have
taken
five
though
i
only
need
three
in
order
to
get
over
the
ground
at
three
miles
an
hour
i
am
obliged
to
have
johannes
with
me
as
comparatively
little
persian
is
spoken
by
the
common
people
along
this
road
beyond
bahar
the
road
lies
over
elevated
destitute
of
springs
and
streams
and
now
scorched
up
one
or
two
small
villages
lying
off
the
track
and
some
ruinous
towers
on
eminences
built
for
watching
robbers
scarcely
break
the
monotony
of
this
miles
march
at
three
having
ascended
nearly
feet
we
reached
the
small
and
very
poor
walled
village
of
kooltapa
below
which
are
some
reservoirs
a
series
of
pools
connected
by
a
stream
and
the
a
fine
piece
of
level
sward
much
of
which
was
already
occupied
by
two
turkish
caravans
with
horses
in
each
and
a
man
to
every
ten
the
loads
were
all
carefully
stacked
covered
with
rugs
and
watched
by
very
large
and
fierce
dogs
i
lay
down
in
the
feeling
really
four
five
sunset
came
but
no
caravan
johannes
was
quite
ill
but
went
to
the
village
to
hire
a
and
to
try
to
get
tea
and
supplies
there
was
neither
tea
nor
and
no
supplies
but
horse
food
and
some
coarse
cheese
and
blanket
bread
too
sour
and
dirty
to
be
eaten
long
after
dark
they
brought
a
little
milk
was
locked
up
in
a
house
and
i
rolled
myself
in
his
blanket
and
the
few
wraps
i
had
with
me
and
making
the
best
of
circumstances
tried
to
sleep
but
it
was
too
cold
and
the
position
too
perilous
and
johannes
who
had
loaded
his
gun
with
ball
overcome
with
fatigue
instead
of
watching
was
sound
asleep
at
eleven
mirza
voice
though
it
said
madam
these
wo
do
for
you
they
are
wicked
men
was
very
welcome
they
had
stopped
and
four
of
them
including
sharban
father
had
dragged
him
off
his
horse
with
some
violence
and
had
unloaded
it
he
appealed
to
the
village
headman
who
after
wrangling
with
them
for
some
hours
persuaded
them
to
let
him
have
a
mule
and
come
to
kooltapa
with
the
servants
tent
my
bed
and
other
comforts
and
sent
two
armed
guides
with
him
the
larger
tent
was
pitched
and
i
went
to
bed
and
not
having
the
nettings
which
hang
from
the
roof
of
my
cabul
tent
and
are
a
complete
security
against
mere
pilferers
i
put
all
i
could
under
the
blankets
and
arranged
the
other
things
within
reach
of
my
hand
in
the
middle
of
the
tent
i
also
burned
a
light
having
learned
that
kooltapa
is
a
dangerous
place
at
midnight
the
turkish
caravans
started
with
noise
inconceivable
yells
of
shouts
of
village
boys
squeals
of
horses
barking
of
big
dogs
firing
of
guns
and
jangling
of
sets
of
bells
all
sobering
down
into
a
grandly
solemn
sound
as
of
many
church
steeples
on
the
march
i
went
out
to
see
that
all
was
right
found
my
servants
sleeping
heavily
and
had
not
the
heart
to
awake
them
found
the
mercury
a
degree
below
the
freezing
point
and
lay
down
covering
my
head
with
a
blanket
for
the
shivering
stage
of
fever
had
come
on
the
night
was
very
still
and
after
some
time
i
heard
in
the
stillness
the
not
uncommon
noise
of
a
dog
as
i
thought
fumbling
outside
my
tent
i
took
no
notice
till
he
seemed
getting
in
when
i
jumped
up
with
an
adjuration
saw
the
floor
vacant
and
heard
human
feet
running
away
i
ran
out
and
fired
blank
cartridge
several
times
in
the
direction
of
the
footsteps
hoping
that
the
flashes
would
reveal
the
miscreant
but
his
movements
had
been
more
agile
than
mine
mirza
ran
into
the
village
and
informed
the
but
he
took
it
very
quietly
and
said
that
the
robbers
were
turks
which
was
false
i
offered
a
large
reward
but
it
was
useless
when
daylight
came
and
i
investigated
my
losses
i
found
myself
without
any
of
the
things
which
i
have
come
to
regard
as
indispensable
my
cork
helmet
boots
gloves
sun
umbrella
stockings
scanty
stock
of
underclothing
all
my
brushes
towels
soap
scissors
needles
thread
thimble
the
strong
combination
knife
which
aziz
coveted
and
which
was
used
three
or
four
times
every
day
a
large
silk
handkerchief
a
hundred
years
old
which
i
wore
as
a
protection
from
the
sun
my
mask
revolver
case
keys
pencils
paint
brushes
sketches
notes
of
journeys
and
my
one
mug
were
all
gone
if
anything
could
be
worse
my
gold
pen
with
which
i
have
written
for
the
last
eighteen
years
had
also
disappeared
furthermore
to
relieve
the
tedium
of
the
long
wait
during
the
pitching
of
my
tent
and
of
the
hour
rest
which
i
am
obliged
to
take
on
my
bed
after
getting
in
i
was
doing
a
large
piece
of
embroidery
from
an
ancient
irish
pattern
arabesques
on
dark
coarse
silk
in
greens
pinks
and
blues
all
outlined
in
gold
this
work
has
been
a
real
pleasure
to
me
and
i
relied
on
it
for
recreation
for
the
rest
of
my
journey
gone
too
with
all
the
silks
and
gold
for
finishing
it
now
i
have
nothing
to
do
when
the
long
marches
are
over
and
as
i
can
scarcely
write
with
this
pen
and
have
also
lost
my
drawing
materials
a
perspective
of
dulness
opens
out
before
me
if
sharban
had
not
disobeyed
orders
and
stayed
behind
with
my
tent
all
this
would
not
have
happened
i
now
realise
what
it
is
to
be
without
what
to
a
european
are
the
necessaries
of
life
and
i
can
scarcely
replace
any
of
them
for
three
weeks
the
caravan
came
in
at
nine
and
i
soon
got
into
my
tent
and
spent
much
of
the
day
in
making
a
by
rolling
lint
and
wadding
in
handkerchiefs
and
sewing
them
up
into
a
sort
of
turban
with
a
and
packthread
obtained
from
mirza
i
was
able
to
get
from
a
villager
a
pair
of
most
serviceable
shoes
with
uppers
made
of
stout
cotton
webbing
knitted
here
by
the
women
and
among
the
bakhtiaris
by
the
men
and
with
soles
of
rag
sewn
and
pressed
tightly
together
and
tipped
with
horn
these
and
the
uppers
are
connected
with
very
stout
leather
brought
to
a
point
at
the
toe
and
heel
are
the
most
comfortable
and
for
dry
weather
and
the
most
indestructible
of
shoes
thus
provided
i
have
to
face
the
discomfort
caused
by
the
other
losses
as
best
i
may
it
no
use
crying
over
spilt
milk
the
day
before
when
the
pulled
mirza
off
his
mule
and
he
threatened
them
with
the
agreement
they
replied
that
it
was
false
that
they
had
made
any
agreement
except
to
take
me
to
urmi
in
twenty
days
and
that
they
were
not
afraid
of
the
prince
governor
of
hamadan
for
he
is
always
asleep
and
the
feringhi
is
a
i
sent
to
them
that
i
wished
to
leave
kooltapa
at
noon
they
replied
that
they
were
not
going
to
move
i
was
in
their
power
for
they
had
received
advance
pay
for
seven
days
and
i
said
no
more
about
moving
however
at
noon
i
sent
mirza
to
read
the
agreement
to
them
and
sharban
and
his
father
could
not
deny
the
authenticity
of
the
seal
and
a
superior
villager
who
could
read
testified
that
mirza
had
read
it
correctly
they
then
saw
that
they
had
put
themselves
into
a
tight
place
and
sent
that
they
desired
to
humble
themselves
saying
your
foot
is
on
our
eyes
a
phrase
of
humility
i
took
no
notice
of
them
all
day
but
at
sunset
sent
for
sharban
and
telling
mirza
not
to
soften
down
my
language
spoke
to
him
in
few
words
you
have
broken
your
agreement
and
you
will
have
to
take
the
consequences
your
conduct
is
disgraceful
and
abominable
so
cowardly
that
you
do
deserve
to
be
called
a
man
it
is
only
what
one
would
expect
from
a
do
you
mean
to
keep
your
agreement
or
not
he
began
to
whine
and
threw
himself
at
my
feet
but
i
reluctantly
assumed
a
terrific
voice
and
saying
bero
be
silent
begone
shut
the
tent
september
no
persian
ever
believes
your
word
and
these
poor
fellows
did
not
believe
that
i
had
letters
to
the
governors
they
are
now
terribly
frightened
and
see
that
a
feringhi
even
though
a
can
not
be
maltreated
with
impunity
when
i
arrived
here
even
before
i
sent
my
letter
of
introduction
the
governor
sent
a
with
compliments
and
offers
of
hospitality
and
afterwards
a
strong
guard
then
sharban
piteously
entreated
that
i
would
not
take
him
before
the
governor
and
would
not
make
him
eat
wood
and
his
big
caravan
at
last
has
chimed
away
on
its
northward
journey
to
be
seen
no
more
thus
by
acting
a
part
absolutely
hateful
to
me
the
mutiny
was
quelled
and
things
are
now
going
on
all
right
except
that
sharban
avails
himself
of
small
opportunities
of
being
disobliging
i
do
sincerely
detest
the
cowardliness
of
the
oriental
nature
which
is
probably
the
result
of
ages
of
oppression
by
superiors
it
is
so
vexing
that
the
policy
of
trust
which
has
served
me
so
well
on
all
former
journeys
has
to
be
abandoned
and
that
one
of
suspicion
has
to
be
substituted
for
it
i
am
told
by
all
europeans
that
from
the
shah
downwards
no
one
trusts
father
brother
wife
superior
or
inferior
every
one
walks
warily
and
suspiciously
through
a
maze
of
fraud
and
falsehood
if
one
asks
a
question
or
any
one
expresses
an
opinion
or
tells
what
passes
for
a
fact
he
looks
over
each
shoulder
to
see
that
no
one
is
listening
a
noble
persian
said
to
me
lying
is
rotting
this
country
persians
tell
lies
before
they
can
speak
almost
every
day
when
one
is
wishing
to
be
trustful
kind
and
considerate
one
encounters
unmitigated
lying
cowardly
bluster
or
fraud
and
the
necessity
of
being
always
on
guard
is
wearing
and
repulsive
here
is
another
specimen
of
the
sort
of
net
which
is
woven
round
a
traveller
at
kooltapa
after
the
theft
i
sent
to
the
for
a
and
he
replied
that
he
could
not
give
one
without
an
order
and
that
as
he
knew
only
turki
my
letter
in
persian
from
the
prince
governor
of
hamadan
was
nothing
to
him
later
a
who
said
he
was
also
a
came
and
said
that
he
only
was
responsible
for
the
safety
of
travellers
and
that
i
could
not
get
a
watchman
from
the
as
no
one
could
pass
the
gates
after
sunset
without
his
permission
i
already
knew
that
there
were
no
gates
he
said
he
was
entitled
to
five
a
night
for
protecting
the
tents
the
charge
is
one
or
under
exceptional
circumstances
two
i
told
him
we
were
quite
capable
of
protecting
ourselves
late
in
the
evening
an
apparently
respectable
man
came
and
warned
us
to
keep
a
good
as
this
and
another
had
vowed
to
rob
our
tents
out
of
revenge
for
not
having
been
employed
these
men
acting
as
are
a
great
terror
to
the
people
they
levy
blackmail
on
caravans
and
take
food
for
their
horses
and
themselves
the
pick
of
everything
without
payment
the
people
also
accuse
them
of
committing
or
being
accessory
to
the
majority
of
highway
robberies
the
women
who
came
to
condole
with
me
on
my
losses
accused
these
men
of
being
the
thieves
but
it
was
younger
feet
which
clattered
away
from
my
tent
sharban
thoroughly
subdued
for
the
time
and
his
servant
watched
and
to
show
that
they
were
awake
fired
their
guns
repeatedly
the
nightly
arrangement
now
is
to
secure
a
watchman
from
the
to
walk
round
the
camp
two
or
three
times
every
night
to
see
that
he
is
awake
and
that
is
all
right
to
secure
the
to
my
bed
with
a
stout
and
to
rope
the
table
and
chair
on
which
i
put
my
few
remaining
things
also
to
the
bed
taking
care
to
put
a
tin
can
with
a
knife
in
it
on
the
very
edge
of
the
table
so
that
if
the
things
are
tampered
with
the
clatter
may
awake
me
after
leaving
kooltapa
treeless
country
becomes
bushless
and
nothing
combustible
is
to
be
got
but
animal
fuel
manure
is
far
too
precious
for
this
purpose
to
be
wasted
on
the
fields
men
with
asses
follow
caravans
and
collect
it
in
bags
the
yards
into
which
the
flocks
and
herds
are
driven
at
night
have
now
been
cleaned
out
and
in
every
village
all
the
women
are
occupied
in
moulding
the
manure
into
or
cakes
fully
a
foot
long
and
four
inches
thick
these
after
being
dried
in
the
sun
are
built
up
into
conical
stacks
often
exceeding
twenty
feet
in
height
and
are
plastered
with

the
making
of
this
artificial
fuel
is
one
of
the
most
important
industries
of
persia
and
is
exclusively
in
the
hands
of
women
the
preparation
of
the
winter
stock
takes
from
six
to
fourteen
weeks
and
is
very
hard
wet
work
the
fuel
gives
out
a
good
deal
of
heat
but
burns
fast
its
combustible
qualities
are
increased
by
an
admixture
of
cut
straw
at
this
season
between
the
colossal
black
stacks
of
fuel
and
the
conical
piles
of

the
villages
are
almost
invisible
the
march
to
gaukhaud
was
over
twenty
miles
of
rolling
scorched
baked
mud
without
inhabitants
gaukhaud
and
the
villages
for
fifty
miles
farther
are
unwalled
but
each
house
with
its
and
upper
and
underground
folds
has
a
massive
mud
wall
sloping
slightly
inwards
with
an
entrance
closed
by
a
heavy
wooden
gate
strengthened
with
iron
the
upper

thick
stone
doors
three

each
house
is
a
fortress
and
nothing
is
to
be
seen
above
its
walls
but
a
quantity
of
beehive
roofs
and
a
number
of
truncated
cones
of
winter
fodder
on
a
central
platform
the
female
costume
is
also
different
the
women
unveiled
and

in

wear
black

vandyked

tasselled
red
skirts
and
black
handkerchiefs
rolled
round
their

little
persian
is
spoken
or
even
understood
and
everything
indicates
that
the
limit
of
persia
proper
the
persia
of
persians
has
been
passed
gaukhaud
is
a
village
of
houses
grows
wheat
barley
grapes
and
melons
and
though
a
once
splendid
caravanserai
on
a
height
is
roofless
and
ruined
and
the
village
has
no
better
water
than
an
irrigation
ditch
it
is
said
to
be
fairly
prosperous
the
march
to
babarashan
is
for
twenty
miles
along
a
featureless
irrigated
valley
about
a
mile
wide
with
grass
and
stubble
several
beehive
villages
and
mud
hills
never
over
feet
high
on
either
side
crossing
a
brick
bridge
over
a
trifling
stream
and
passing
through
the
large
village
of
tulwar
where
men
who
were
burying
a
corpse
politely
laid
fried
flavoured
with
sesamum
on
my
we
ascended
over
low
scorched
hills
much
ploughed
for
winter
sowing
to
the
beehive
village
of
babarashan
of
houses
abundantly
supplied
with
water
where
we
camped
close
to
some
tents
of
the
kara
tepe
and
a
large
caravan
the
dust
blown
across
the
camp
from
the
was
obnoxious
but
inevitable
the
sharp
threshing
instruments
having
teeth
are
not
used
in
this
region
but
mobs
of
animals
up
to
a
dozen
tied
together
oxen
cows
horses
and
asses
are
driven
over
the
wheat
i
am
finding
the
disadvantages
of
having
an
untrained
servant
johannes
that
evening
ran
hither
and
thither
without
method
never
finished
anything
spent
an
hour
in
bargaining
for
a
fowl
failed
to
get
his
fire
to
burn
consequently
could
not
cook
or
make
tea
and
i
went
supperless
to
bed
the
same
confusion
prevailed
the
next
morning
but
things
have
been
better
since
no
life
is
so
charming
as
camp
life
but
incompetent
servants
are
a
great
drawback
another
uninteresting
march
of
twenty
miles
over
high
and
through
a
valley
surrounded
by
mud
hills
with
quaint
outcrops
of
broken
rock
on
their
summits
and
a
pass
through
some
picturesque
rocky
hills
brought
us
into
a
basin
among
mountains
in
which
stands
the
rather
important
town
of
bijar
in
the
midst
of
poplars
willows
apricots
and
vines
bijar
is
said
to
have
inhabitants
it
has
a
governor
for
itself
and
the
surrounding
district
and
a
garrison
of
a
regiment
of
infantry
and
to
keep
the
turbulent
frontier
kurds
in
order
it
has
ruinous
mud
walls
no
regular
bazars
only
shops
at
intervals
fully
a
third
is
in
ruins
and
most
of
the
houses
and
even
the
governor
palace
are
falling
into
decay
it
is
however
accounted
a
thriving
place
and
is
noted
for
and
work
it
has
four
caravanserais
hardly
habitable
however
seven
and
a
few
mosques
and
schools
it
has
an
air
of
being
quite
out
of
the
world
i
have
been
here
two
days
and
as
foreigners
are
very
rarely
seen
the
greater
part
of
the
population
has
strolled
past
my
tent
i
camped
as
usual
outside
the
walls
near
a
small
spring
and
soon
a
came
from
the
governor
with
a
message
expressive
of
much
annoyance
at
my
having
camped
in
the
wilderness
when
i
was
their
guest
and
they
would
have
given
me
a
safe
in
the
palace
garden
mirza
took
my
introduction
to
him
and
he
sent
a
second
message
saying
that
the
next
three
marches
were
very
dangerous
and
appointed
an
hour
for
an
interview
soon
eight
infantrymen
well
uniformed
and
set
up
with
rifles
and
fixed
bayonets
arrived
and
mounted
guard
round
my
tent
changing
every
six
hours
this
completed
sharban
discomfiture
various
difficulties
arose
on
sunday
and
much
against
my
will
i
had
to
call
on
the
governor
he
received
me
in
a
sort
of
a
great
number
of
men
litigants
and
others
crowded
the
corridors
and
he
looked
bloated
and
dissipated
and
seemed
scarcely
sober
he
sat
on
cushions
on
the
floor
with
a
row
of
scribes
and
on
his
right
and
many
and
soldiers
stood
about
the
door
seyyids
handsome
and
haughty
glanced
at
me
contemptuously
and
the
drunken
giggle
of
the
khan
and
the
fixed
scowl
of
the
motionless
row
of
scribes
were
really
overpowering
tea
was
produced
but
the
circumstances
were
so
disagreeable
that
i
did
not
wait
for
the
conventional
third
cup
the
khan
said
that
the
ladies
are
in
the
country
a
few
miles
off
and
hoped
i
would
visit
them
that
some
marches
on
the
road
are
unsafe
and
that
he
would
give
me
a
letter
which
would
be
useful
in
procuring
escorts
after
i
left
his
jurisdiction
and
he
has
since
sent
it
he
was
quite
courteous
as
indeed
all
persians
of
the
upper
classes
are
but
i
hope
never
again
to
pass
through
the
ordeal
of
calling
upon
a
moslem
without
a
european
escort
later
the
principal
wife
of
the
military
commander
of
the
district
called
with
a
train
of
shrouded
women
followed
by
servants
bringing
an
abundant
dinner
with
much
fruit
she
came
to
ask
me
to
take
up
my
quarters
in
the
very
handsome
house
which
is
her
husband
very
near
my
tent
after
a
good
deal
of
intelligent
conversation
she
asked
if
i
had
a
husband
and
children
and
on
my
replying
in
the
negative
she
expressed
very
kindly
sympathy
but
added
there
are
things
far
worse
things
which
can
never
be
where
as
among
you
there
is
only
one
wife
one
may
have
a
husband
and
children
and
yet
god
knows
be
made
nearly
mad
by
troubles
and
she
looked
as
if
indeed
her
sorrows
were
great
doubtless
a
young
wife
has
been
installed
as
favourite
or
there
is
a
divorce
impending
september
this
is
a
great
region
and
by
no
means
unprosperous
but
it
only
yields
one
crop
a
year
the
land
is
ploughed
immediately
after
harvest
and
the
irrigation
is
cut
off
until
consequently
nothing
can
exceed
the
ugliness
of
the
aspect
of
the
country
at
this
time
there
is
not
one
redeeming
feature
and
on
the
long
marches
there
is
rarely
anything
to
please
or
interest
the
eye
on
the
march
from
bijar
there
was
not
a
green
thing
except
some
poplars
and
willows
by
a
stream
not
a
blade
of
grass
not
a
green
weed
nothing
but
low
mud
hills
with
their
sides
much
ploughed
and
the
furrows
baked
hard
and
unploughed
gravelly
stretches
covered
sparsely
with
scorched
thistles
eight
miles
of
an
easy
descent
of
feet
brought
us
to
the
kizil
uzen
a
broad
but
fordable
stream
on
the
other
side
of
which
is
salamatabad
a
village
consisting
chiefly
of
the
large
walled
gardens
and
houses
of
the
governor
of
bijar
a
little
higher
up
there
is
a
solid
stone
bridge
over
feet
long
this
kizil
uzen
is
one
of
the
most
important
streams
in
north
persia
it
drains
a
very
large
area
and
after
a
long
and
devious
course
enters
the
caspian
sea
under
the
name
of
the
sefid
rud
eleven
miles
from
this
place
i
crossed
the
lofty
crest
of
the
ridge
which
divides
the
drainage
basins
of
the
kizil
uzen
and
urmi
a
number
of
came
out
and
escorted
me
through
a
gateway
down
a
road
with
high
walls
and
buildings
on
both
sides
to
an
inner
gateway
leading
to
the
khan
here
we
all
dismounted
but
the
next
step
was
not
obvious
for
the
heavy
wooden
gate
which
secludes
the
was
strongly
barred
and
showed
no
symptoms
of
welcome
an
aged
eunuch
put
his
melancholy
head
out
of
a
hole
at
the
side
and
said
that
the
ladies
were
expecting
me
and
that
food
was
ready
for
the
animals
and
the
servants
but
still
the
gate
moved
not
i
asked
if
mirza
could
go
with
me
to
interpret
the
suggesting
that
he
could
be
screened
behind
a
curtain
quite
a
usual
mode
of
disposing
of
such
a
difficulty
the
eunuch
returned
and
with
him
the
khan
mother
a
woman
who
looked
through
the
but
on
seeing
a
young
man
drew
back
and
said
very
definitely
that
no
man
could
be
admitted
especially
in
the
absence
of
the
khan
all
the
men
were
warned
off
and
the
door
was
opened
so
as
just
to
allow
of
my
entrance
and
no
more
the
principal
wife
received
me
in
a
fine
lofty
room
with
fretwork
windows
opening
on
a
courtyard
with
a
fountain
in
it
and
a
few
pomegranates
and
a
crowd
of
persian
kurdish
and
negro
women
with
all
manner
of
babies
the
lady
is
from
tihran
and
her
manners
have
some
of
the
ease
and
polish
of
the
capital
it
is
still
the
moharrem
and
she
was
enveloped
in
a
black
and
wore
as
her
sole
ornament
a
small
watch
as
a
locket
her
who
like
many
in
persia
fills
the
post
of
to
the
establishment
frightened
me
by
the
expression
of
her
handsome
face
and
her
sneering
fiendish
laugh
it
must
be
admitted
that
there
was
much
to
amuse
her
for
my
slender
stock
of
persian
is
the
persian
of
muleteers
rather
than
of
polite
circles
and
she
mimicked
every
word
i
uttered
looking
all
the
time
like
one
of
michael
angelo
fates
the
room
was
very
prettily
curtained
and
furnished
with
russian
materials
they
told
me
and
the
lithographs
the
photographs
and
their
frames
and
the
many
which
adorned
the
tables
and
recesses
were
all
russian
they
showed
me
several
small
clocks
and
very
ingenious
watches
all
russian
also
they
said
that
the
goods
in
the
shops
at
bijar
are
chiefly
russian
and
added
the
english
try
to
suit
our
taste
as
the
russians
do
the
principal
lady
expressed
a
wish
for
greater
liberty
though
she
qualified
it
by
saying
that
men
who
love
their
wives
could
not
let
them
go
about
as
the
english
ladies
do
in
tihran
dinner
had
been
prepared
a
huge
persian
dinner
but
they
kindly
allowed
me
to
take
tea
instead
and
produced
with
it
manna
and
a
cake
flavoured
with
asafoetida
when
i
came
to
an
end
of
my
persian
and
they
of
their
ideas
i
said
farewell
and
was
followed
to
the
gate
by
the
mocking
laugh
of
the
the
asserted
that
the
next
was
very
dangerous
so
we
kept
together
wild
desolate
rolling
scrubless
open
country
it
is
the
spurs
of
the
kurdish
hills
the
were
very
fussy
and
did
a
great
deal
of
galloping
and
scouting
saying
that
bands
of
robber
horsemen
are
often
met
with
on
this
route
who
being
sunnis
would
rejoice
in
attacking
shiahs
doubtless
they
magnified
the
risk
in
order
to
enhance
the
value
of
their
services
in
the
early
afternoon
we
reached
the
kurdish
village
of
karabul
k
sixty
mud
hovels
on
the
flaring
mud
hillside
the
great
fodder
stacks
on
the
flat
roofs
alone
making
the
houses
obvious
the
water
is
very
bad
and
limited
in
quantity
and
of
milk
there
was
none
the
people
are
very
poor
and
unprosperous
and
a
meaner
set
of
donkeys
and
oxen
than
those
which
were
treading
out
the
corn
close
to
my
tent
i
have
not
seen
though
most
of
the
inhabitants
are
kurds
there
are
some
persians
and
turks
and
each
nationality
has
its
own
towards
evening
the
came
to
me
with
the
three
who
they
said
would
arrange
for
a
guard
and
for
my
escort
the
next
day
i
did
not
like
this
for
the
had
good
guns
and
were
in
persian
uniform
and
had
been
given
me
for
three
days
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
the
said
that
they
could
not
guarantee
my
safety
that
night
with
less
than
ten
men
and
i
saw
in
the
whole
affair
a
design
on
my
very
slender
purse
a
monetary
panic
set
in
before
i
reached
hamadan
the
sovereign
had
fallen
from
to
the
jews
would
not
take
english
paper
at
any
price
i
could
not
cash
my
circular
notes
and
it
was
only
through
the
kindness
of
the
american
missionaries
that
i
had
any
money
at
all
and
i
had
only
enough
for
ordinary
expenses
as
far
as
urmi
i
told
them
that
i
could
only
pay
two
men
and
dismissed
the
with
a
present
quite
out
of
proportion
to
the
time
they
had
been
with
me
during
these
arrangements
the
hubbub
was
indescribable
but
the
men
were
very
pleasant
three
hours
later
the
returned
saying
that
after
riding
eight
miles
they
had
met
a
messenger
with
a
letter
from
the
khan
telling
them
to
go
on
another
day
with
me
i
asked
to
see
the
letter
and
then
they
said
it
was
a
verbal
message
they
had
never
been
outside
of
karabul
k
i
tell
this
in
detail
to
show
how
intricate
are
the
meshes
of
the
net
in
which
a
traveller
on
these
unfrequented
roads
is
entangled
later
ten
kurds
with
long
guns
various
varieties
of
old
swords
and
long
knives
lighted
great
on
either
side
of
my
tent
and
put
between
them
this
pet
likes
fires
and
lies
down
fearlessly
among
the
men
close
to
the
embers
a
little
below
my
camp
was
a
solitary
melon
garden
with
a
low
mud
wall
at
midnight
i
was
awakened
by
the
loud
report
of
several
guns
close
to
my
tent
and
confused
shouts
of
men
with
outcries
of
women
and
children
the
watchmen
saw
two
men
robbing
the
melon
garden
shot
one
and
captured
both
i
gave
a
present
to
the
guards
in
the
morning
and
the
took
half
of
it
the
march
to
jafirabad
is
over
the
same
monotonous
country
over
rolling
hills
with
small
plateaux
among
them
very
destitute
of
water
and
consequently
of
population
the
village
of
khashmaghal
with
houses
and
two
ruined
forts
being
the
one
object
of
interest
on
the
way
to
jafirabad
is
the
small
village
of
nasrabad
once
a
cluster
of
hovels
inhabited
by
thieves
some
years
ago
the
present
shah
halted
near
it
on
one
of
his
hunting
excursions
and
observing
the
desolation
of
the
country
and
water
running
to
waste
gave
money
and
lands
to
bribe
a
number
of
families
to
settle
there
there
are
now
sixty
houses
surrounded
by
much
material
wealth
the
shah
still
divides
yearly
among
the
people
and
takes
a
very
small
tribute
has
many
misdeeds
to
answer
for
many
despotic
acts
and
some
bloodshed
but
among
the
legions
of
complaints
of
oppression
and
grinding
exactions
which
i
hear
in
most
places
i
have
not
heard
one
of
the
tribute
fixed
by
him
solely
of
the
exactions
and
merciless
rapacity
of
the
governors
and
their
subordinate
officials
jafirabad
a
village
of
houses
in
the
midst
of
arable
land
has
one
of
those
of
smooth
green
sward
at
once
so
tempting
and
so
risky
and
we
all
got
rheumatism
in
the
moist
chilliness
of
the
night
the
mercury
is
still
falling
slowly
and
steadily
and
the
sun
is
only
really
hot
between
ten
and
four
jafirabad
is
a
prosperous
village
owned
as
many
in
this
region
are
by
the
governor
of
tabriz
who
is
merciful
as
to
tribute
everything
was
wet
even
inside
my
tent
it
was
actually
cold
in
the
yellow
dawn
i
heard
mirza
cheerful
voice
saying
madam
they
think
your
horse
is
dead
the
creature
had
been
stretched
out
motionless
for
two
hours
in
the
midst
of
bustle
and
packing
i
told
them
to
take
off
his
which
was
nearly
full
but
still
he
did
not
move
i
went
up
to
him
and
said
sharply
come
get
up
old
and
he
struggled
slowly
to
his
feet
shook
himself
and
at
once
fumbled
in
my
pockets
for
food
thumping
me
with
his
head
as
usual
when
he
failed
to
find
any
he
was
benumbed
by
sleeping
on
the
damp
ground
in
the
the
next
night
he
chose
to
sleep
under
the
verandah
of
my
tent
snoring
loudly
he
has
became
quite
a
friend
and
companion
the
finally
left
me
there
and
i
was
escorted
by
the
a
very
pleasant
intelligent
man
of
considerable
property
with
his
two
retainers
the
next
stage
has
the
reputation
of
being
very
dangerous
and
many
people
anxious
to
go
to
the
next
village
joined
my
caravan
my
tents
were
guarded
by
eight
village
kurds
armed
with
clubbed
sticks
and
long
guns
i
asked
the
if
two
were
not
enough
and
he
said
that
i
should
only
pay
for
two
the
others
were
there
for
his
satisfaction
that
two
might
combine
to
rob
me
but
that
more
would
watch
each
other
and
that
the
robbers
of
this
region
do
not
pilfer
in
ones
and
twos
but
swoop
down
on
tents
in
large
parties
the
next
march
is
chiefly
along
valleys
among
low
hills
the
did
much
scouting
not
without
good
reason
and
we
all
kept
close
together
a
party
of
men
rode
down
upon
us
and
joined
us
mirza
sidled
up
to
me
and
in
his
usual
cheery
tones
said
madam
these
are
robbers
they
were
men
of
a
band
under
one
hassan
khan
they
spoke
persian
and
mirza
kept
me
informed
of
what
they
were
saying
they
said
they
had
been
out
a
night
and
a
day
without
success
and
they
must
take
my
baggage
and
horse
they
wanted
horses
badly
the
to
whom
they
were
well
known
remonstrated
with
them
and
the
parley
went
on
for
some
time
they
insisting
and
he
threatening
them
with
the
regiment
from
bijar
but
all
he
said
was
of
no
use
till
he
told
them
that
i
was
the
wife
of
the
governor
of
tabriz
that
i
had
been
paying
a
visit
to
hamadan
and
was
then
going
to
be
the
guest
of
the
ladies
of
hadji
baba
governor
of
achaz
that
i
had
been
committed
to
him
and
that
he
was
answerable
for
my
safety
you
know
i
am
a
man
of
my
word
was
the
conclusion
of
this
brilliant
lie
which
served
its
purpose
for
they
said
they
knew
him
and
would
not
rob
me
they
rode
with
us
for
some
miles
in
fact
the
leader
a
elderly
man
in
a
turban
and
brown
like
an
arab
rode
so
close
to
me
that
the
barrel
of
his
gun
constantly
touched
my
saddle
they
carried
guns
besides
revolvers
on
coming
to
a
part
of
the
country
where
the
said
the
road
became
safe
i
sent
the
caravan
on
with
the
servants
the
band
having
gone
in
another
direction
and
halted
for
two
hours
riding
on
again
and
turning
sharply
round
a
large
rock
there
they
all
were
dismounted
and
rushed
out
upon
us
a
ensued
and
as
i
then
had
only
two
men
they
were
two
to
one
and
would
certainly
have
overpowered
my
escort
had
not
several
horsemen
appeared
in
the
distance
when
they
mounted
and
rode
away
one
of
the
horses
was
scratched
and
i
got
an
accidental
cut
on
my
wrist
they
believed
that
i
had
a
considerable
sum
of
money
with
me
the
of
takautapa
said
that
they
had
robbed
his
village
of
some
cattle
a
few
days
before
takautapa
is
a
village
of
houses
with
two
shops
and
a
gunsmith
who
seemed
to
drive
a
roaring
trade
for
three
days
i
have
scarcely
seen
an
unarmed
man
shepherds
herdsmen
ploughmen
travellers
all
carry
arms
mirza
went
to
the
governor
of
achaz
six
miles
off
with
my
letter
from
the
governor
of
bijar
and
he
was
most
courteous
he
sent
his
secretary
to
ask
me
to
spend
a
day
or
two
at
his
house
and
told
him
in
case
i
could
not
to
remain
for
the
night
to
arrange
for
my
comfort
and
safety
an
order
very
efficiently
carried
out
he
sent
word
also
that
if
i
could
not
accept
his
hospitality
i
was
still
to
be
his
guest
and
not
to
pay
for
anything
a
kindness
which
for
several
reasons
i
never
accept
he
added
that
though
the
road
was
safe
he
should
send
three
to
show
the
honour
and
they
had
received
strict
orders
not
to
accept
any
present
the
men
who
attempted
to
rob
my
caravan
spent
the
night
here
and
as
they
had
robbed
them
before
the
villagers
were
very
glad
of
the
protection
of
the
governor
scribe
and
my
k
october
having
been
courteously
entreated
i
sent
on
the
caravan
and
servants
at
daybreak
and
having
the
with
me
was
able
to
make
the
march
to
geokahaz
at
a
fast
pace
the
were
three
kurds
well
mounted
and
in
galloping
had
to
exert
himself
considerably
to
keep
up
with
them
and
they
obviously
tried
to
force
his
pace
the
day
was
cool
cool
enough
for
a
sheepskin
coat
and
the
air
delightful
the
halcyon
season
for
persian
travelling
has
come
the
difficulties
are
over
and
the
fever
has
left
me
brown
bare
and
bushless
as
are
the
rolling
hills
over
which
the
road
passes
it
would
be
impossible
not
to
enjoy
the
long
gallops
over
the
stoneless
soil
the
crisp
bracing
air
the
pure
blue
of
the
glittering
sky
and
the
changed
altitude
of
the
sun
which
from
having
been
my
worst
foe
is
now
a
genial
friend
true
the
country
over
which
i
pass
is
not
interesting
but
as
everywhere
in
persia
craggy
mountains
are
in
sight
softened
by
a
veil
of
heavenly
blue
and
the
country
though
uninteresting
suggests
pleasant
thoughts
of
fertility
an
abundant
harvest
and
an
industrious
and
fairly
prosperous
people
turki
is
now
almost
exclusively
spoken
the
whole
of
that
day
route
was
an
ascent
and
the
was
nearly
feet
in
altitude
i
crossed
the
sarakh
river
by
a
brick
bridge
and
afterwards
the
from
which
there
is
an
extensive
view
and
reached
geokahaz
by
a
rough
path
on
the
hillside
frequently
dipping
into
deep
gulches
now
dry
the
wettest
of
these
is
close
to
the
village
and
is
utilised
for
a
springs
abound
and
as
persian
soil
brings
forth
abundantly
wherever
there
is
water
the
village
which
is
kurdish
confessed
to
being
extremely
prosperous
its
seven
were
in
the
full
tide
of
winnowing
with
the
fan
and
so
complete
is
the
process
that
nothing
but
the
wheat
is
left
on
the
firm
hardened
gypsum
floor
recalling
the
baptist
words
whose
fan
is
in
his
hand
and
he
will
throughly
purge
his
floor
the
wheat
was
everywhere
being
gathered
into
the
garner
the
large
upright
clay
receptacles
holding
twenty
bushels
each
with
which
every
house
is
supplied
this
village
of
only
houses
owns
sheep
and
goats
horses
and
mares
and
head
of
cattle
and
its
tribute
is
only
it
and
very
many
other
villages
belong
to
haidar
khan
governor
of
achaz
of
whom
the
villagers
speak
as
a
lenient
lord
apricot
and
pear
orchards
abound
and
on
a
piece
of
grass
in
one
of
these
i
found
my
camp
most
delectably
pitched
the
and
several
other
men
came
to
meet
me
indeed
the
consisted
of
over
twenty
kurdish
horsemen
the
village
was
absolutely
crowded
with
men
and
horses
pilgrims
being
lodged
there
for
the
night
the
road
at
intervals
all
day
had
been
enlivened
by
long
files
of
men
in
bands
of
each
on
their
way
to
the
shrines
of
kerbela
south
of
babylon
to
accumulate
merit
receive
certificates
and
be
called
for
the
remainder
of
their
lives
men
in
the
very
prime
of
life
most
of
them
are
cheerful
and
ruddy
wearing
huge
black
sheepskin
caps
shaped
like
mushrooms
high
boots
gaily
embroidered
into
which
their
full
trousers
are
tucked
and
brown
sheepskin
coats
covering
not
only
themselves
but
the
bodies
of
their
handsome
fiery
horses
a
few
elderly
unveiled
women
were
among
them
they
ride
mostly
on
pads
with
their
bedding
and
clothing
under
them
and
their
and
cooking
utensils
hanging
at
the
sides
all
are
armed
with
guns
and
swords
i
met
over
of
them
most
of
them
russian
subjects
and
those
who
had
occasion
to
pass
in
front
of
my
tent
vindicated
their
claim
to
be
the
subjects
of
a
civilised
power
by
bowing
low
as
often
as
they
saw
me
they
are
really
splendid
men
and
had
many
elements
of
the
picturesque
the
who
halted
in
geokahaz
were
under
the
command
of
a
seyyid
who
before
starting
beat
about
for
recruits
and
levied
from
them
about
five
per
head
on
the
journey
he
receives
great
honour
as
a
descendant
of
the
prophet
he
has
a
baggage
mule
and
a
tent
and
the
pilgrims
under
his
charge
gratefully
cook
his
food
wait
on
him
groom
his
animal
water
the
dusty
ground
round
his
tent
shampoo
his
limbs
keep
the
flies
from
him
and
are
rewarded
for
the
performance
of
all
menial
offices
by
being
allowed
to
kiss
his
hand
on
his
part
he
chooses
the
best
stations
and
the
most
fortunate
days
for
starting
and
he
pledges
himself
to
protect
his
flock
from
the
woful
plots
of
malignant
genii
and
the
effects
of
the
evil
eye
on
the
journey
he
both
preaches
and
recites
tales
the
seyyid
in
charge
of
this
party
was
a
man
of
commanding
and
deadly
pallor
of
countenance
as
frigid
as
marble
out
of
which
his
statuesque
face
might
well
have
been
carved
he
received
the
attention
paid
to
him
with
the
sublime
indifference
of
a
statue
of
buddha
the
odour
of
an
acknowledged
sanctity
hung
about
him
and
pride
of
race
and
pride
of
asceticism
dwelt
upon
his
handsome
features
he
spent
the
evening
in
preaching
a
sermon
and
by
a
exhibition
of
emotion
studied
to
perfection
wound
up
his
large
audience
to
a
pitch
of
enthusiasm
the
subject
was
the
virtues
of
houssein
and
what
preacher
could
take
such
a
text
without
enlarging
finally
upon
the
martyrdom
of
that
sainted
man
then
the
auditors
wept
and
howled
and
beat
their
breasts
and
long
after
i
left
the
singular
scene
trained
cheers
for
the
prophet
for
ali
and
for
the
martyred
hassan
and
houssein
led
by
the
seyyid
rang
out
upon
the
still
night
air
at
midnight
and
again
at
four
a
solitary
voice
proclaimed
over
the
sleeping
village
there
is
but
one
god
and
mohammed
is
his
prophet
and
ali
is
his
lieutenant
and
voices
repeated
grandly
in
unison
there
is
but
one
god
holy
and
true
and
mohammed
is
his
prophet
and
ali
is
his
lieutenant
the
addition
of
the
words
holy
and
true
to
the
ordinary
formula
is
very
striking
and
is
i
believe
quite
unusual
the
seyyid
preached
in
persian
and
the
pilgrims
speak
it
in
such
caravans
a
strictly
democratic
feeling
prevails
all
yield
honour
to
the
seyyid
but
otherwise
all
are
equal
no
matter
what
the
social
differences
are
the
pilgrims
eat
the
same
food
lodge
in
the
same
rooms
sit
round
the
same
bivouac
fire
and
use
towards
each
other
perfect
freedom
of
speech
a
like
errand
and
a
like
creed
constituting
a
simple
bond
of
brotherhood
geokahaz
is
the
first
kurdish
village
in
which
i
have
really
mixed
with
the
people
i
found
them
cordial
hospitable
and
in
every
way
pleasant
the
wife
called
on
me
and
later
i
returned
the
visit
each
house
or
establishment
has
much
the
same
externals
being
walled
round
and
having
between
the
wall
and
house
an
irregular
yard
to
which
access
is
gained
by
a
gate
of
plaited
osiers
within
are
very
low
and
devious
buildings
with
thick
mud
walls
the
an
alcove
with
plastered
walls
decorated
with
circles
and
other
figures
in
red
is
the
of
the
men
with
their
guns
and
pipes
it
is
necessary
to
stoop
very
low
to
enter
the
house
proper
for
the
doorway
is
only
three
feet
high
and
is
protected
by
a
heavy
wooden
door
strengthened
by
iron
clamps
the
interior
resembles
a
cavern
owing
to
the
absence
of
windows
the
labyrinth
of
rooms
not
six
feet
high
the
gnarled
unbarked
trees
which
support
the
roofs
the
dimness
the
immense
thickness
of
the
mud
walls
the
rays
of
light
coming
in
through
protected
holes
in
the
roof
the
horses
tethered
to
the
and
the
smoke
the
is
a
small
recess
rendered
smaller
by
a
row
of
clay
receptacles
for
grain
as
high
as
the
roof
on
one
side
and
a
row
of
each
large
enough
to
hold
a
man
on
the
other
a
fire
of
animal
fuel
in
a
hole
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
emitted
much
pungent
smoke
and
little
heat
a
number
of
thick
wadded
quilts
were
arranged
for
me
and
tea
was
served
in
russian
glass
cups
from
a
russian
the
wife
was
handsome
and
never
in
any
country
have
i
seen
a
more
beautiful
girl
than
the
daughter
who
might
have
posed
for
a
madonna
they
told
me
that
for
the
five
months
of
winter
the
snow
comes
as
high
as
the
mouth
and
that
there
is
no
egress
from
the
village
the
men
attend
to
the
horses
and
stock
and
the
women
weave
carpets
but
much
of
the
time
is
spent
by
both
in
sleep
accompanied
by
this
beautiful
girl
who
is
graceful
as
well
as
beautiful
and
an
old
servant
i
paid
many
visits
and
found
all
the
houses
arranged
in
the
same
fashion
i
was
greatly
impressed
by
their
scrupulous
cleanliness
the
floors
of
hardened
clay
are
as
clean
as
sweeping
can
make
them
and
the
people
are
clean
in
dress
and
person
the
women
many
of
whom
are
very
handsome
are
unveiled
and
do
not
even
wear
the
the
very
becoming
is
a
black
coronet
from
which
silver
coins
depend
by
silver
chains
a
red
kerchief
is
loosely
knotted
over
the
back
of
the
head
on
which
heavy
plaits
of
hair
are
looped
up
by
silver
pins
this
girl
passed
with
me
through
the
crowds
of
strange
men
unveiled
with
a
simplicity
and
maidenly
dignity
which
were
very
pleasing
it
was
refreshing
to
see
the
handsome
faces
erect
carriage
and
firm
elastic
walk
of
these
kurdish
women
after
the
tottering
gait
of
the
shrouded
formless
bundles
which
pass
for
persian
women
the
men
are
equally
handsome
and
are
very
these
kurdish
villagers
are
sunnis
and
are
on
bad
terms
with
their
neighbours
the
shiahs
and
occasionally
they
drive
off
each
cattle
on
leaving
this
pleasant
place
early
next
morning
the
and
a
number
of
men
escorted
me
for
the
first
and
with
my
escort
of
increased
by
four
riding
as
it
seemed
good
to
them
in
front
or
behind
sometimes
wheeling
their
horses
at
a
gallop
in
circles
sometimes
tearing
up
and
down
steep
hills
firing
over
the
left
shoulders
and
right
flanks
of
their
horses
lunging
at
each
other
with
scimitars
and
singing
inharmonious
songs
we
passed
through
a
deep
ravine
watered
by
a
fine
stream
which
emerges
through
gates
of
black
red
and
orange
rock
into
a
long
valley
then
up
and
up
over
long
rolling
hills
and
then
down
and
down
to
a
large
ilyat
camp
beside
a
muddy
and
nearly
exhausted
stream
where
they
feasted
and
i
rested
in
my
two
or
three
times
these
galloped
up
to
shepherds
who
were
keeping
their
flocks
and
demanded
a
young
sheep
from
each
for
the
return
journey
and
were
not
refused
the
peasants
fear
these
men
much
they
assert
that
so
far
from
protecting
caravans
and
travellers
they
are
answerable
for
most
of
the
robberies
on
the
road
that
they
take
their
best
fowls
and
lambs
without
payment
and
ten
pounds
of
barley
a
day
for
their
horses
and
if
complaints
are
made
they
quarter
themselves
on
the
complainant
for
several
days
for
these
reasons
i
object
very
strongly
to
escorts
where
they
are
not
absolutely
needed
for
security
i
pay
each
man
two
a
day
and
formerly
gave
each
two
daily
as
road
money
for
himself
and
his
horse
but
finding
that
they
took
the
food
without
paying
for
it
i
now
pay
the
people
directly
for
the
keep
of
the
men
and
horses
even
by
this
method
i
have
not
circumvented
the
rapacity
of
these
horsemen
for
after
i
have
settled
the
bill
they
threaten
to
beat
the
unless
he
gives
them
the
money
i
have
given
him
the
ilyat
women
from
the
camp
crowded
round
me
with
a
familiarity
which
even
in
savages
is
distressing
a
contrast
to
the
good
manners
and
unobtrusiveness
of
the
women
of
geokahaz
on
the
way
to
sanjud
a
kurdish
village
in
a
ravine
so
steep
that
it
was
barely
possible
to
find
a
level
space
big
enough
for
my
tent
there
is
some
very
fine
scenery
and
from
the
slope
of
kuh
surisart
on
the
east
side
of
the
the
loftiest
land
between
hamadan
and
urmi
the
view
is
truly
magnificent
the
nearer
ranges
stood
out
boldly
in
yellow
and
red
ochre
in
the
valleys
indigo
shadows
lay
range
beyond
range
of
hills
were
atmospherically
glorified
by
brilliant
cobalt
colouring
and
the
hills
which
barred
the
horizon
dissolved
away
in
a
blue
which
blended
with
the
sky
in
that
vast
solitude
the
fine
ruins
of
the
fortress
palace
of
karaftu
where
the
fountain
still
leaps
in
the
deserted
courtyard
are
a
very
conspicuous
object
from
the
mianmalek
pass
there
is
a
descent
of
feet
to
the
sea
of
urmi
and
the
keen
edge
of
the
air
became
much
blunted
ere
we
reached
sanjud
nearly
the
whole
of
the
road
from
hamadan
has
been
extremely
solitary
we
have
not
met
or
passed
a
single
caravan
and
on
this
march
of
seven
hours
we
did
not
see
a
human
being
yet
there
are
villages
lying
in
the
valleys
among
the
hills
and
an
enormous
extent
of
country
is
under
tillage
in
fact
this
region
is
one
of
the
granaries
of
persia
sanjud
is
a
village
of
eighty
houses
built
into
a
hillside
above
which
rises
a
high
hill
of
red
mud
it
is
not
possible
to
give
an
idea
of
the
aspect
of
the
country
at
this
season
sheep
and
goats
certainly
find
pickings
among
the
rocks
but
the
visible
herbage
has
all
been
eaten
down
the
thistles
and
other
fodder
plants
have
been
cut
and
stacked
in
the
villages
most
of
the
streams
are
dry
and
the
supplies
of
drinking
water
are
only
pools
much
fouled
by
cattle
the
snows
which
supply
the
sources
of
the
irrigation
channels
have
all
melted
and
these
channels
are
either
dry
or
stopped
there
has
scarcely
been
a
shower
since
early
april
and
for
nearly
six
months
the
untempered
rays
of
the
persian
sun
have
been
blazing
upon
the
soil
the
arable
land
ploughed
in
deep
furrows
has
every
furrow
hardened
into
brick
villages
of
yellow
or
whitish
baked
mud
supporting
on
their
dusty
roofs
buff
stacks
of
baked
fodder
are
hardly
distinguishable
from
the
baked
hillsides
the
roads
are
a
few
inches
deep
in
glaring
white
dust
over
the
plains
a
brown
dust
haze
hangs
this
rainless
and
land
lives
by
the
winter
snows
and
the
snowfall
of
the
zagros
ranges
is
the
most
interesting
of
all
subjects
to
the
cultivator
of
western
persia
if
the
country
were
more
populous
and
the
profits
of
labour
were
secure
storage
for
the
would
be
an
easy
task
and
barren
wastes
might
sustain
a
prosperous
people
for
the
soil
when
irrigated
is
prolific
and
the
sun
can
always
be
relied
upon
to
do
his
part
the
waste
of
water
is
great
as
considerably
more
than
half
the
drainage
of
the
empire
passes
into
and
other
depressions
the
average
rainfall
on
the
central
plateau
is
estimated
by
sir
oliver
john
at
five
inches
only
in
the
year
my
arrival
at
sanjud
was
not
welcome
the
sent
word
that
he
was
not
prepared
to
obey
the
orders
of
the
of
achaz
i
could
buy
he
said
what
i
could
get
but
he
would
furnish
neither
supplies
nor
guards
for
the
camp
i
did
not
wonder
at
this
for
a
traveller
carrying
an
official
letter
is
apt
to
be
palmed
off
on
the
villagers
as
a
guest
and
is
not
supposed
to
pay
for
anything
i
went
to
see
the
and
assured
him
that
i
should
pay
him
myself
for
all
supplies
and
a
night
wages
to
each
watchman
and
the
difficulty
vanished
many
of
the
handsome
village
women
came
to
see
me
the
made
me
a
feast
in
his
house
and
when
i
bade
him
farewell
in
the
morning
he
said
solemnly
we
are
very
glad
you
have
been
our
guest
we
have
suffered
no
loss
or
inconvenience
by
having
you
we
should
like
to
be
protected
by
the
great
english
nation
this
polite
phrase
is
frequently
used
the
persian
kurds
impress
me
favourably
as
a
manly
frank
hospitable
people
the
men
are
courteous
without
being
cringing
and
the
women
are
kind
and
jolly
and
come
freely
and
unveiled
to
my
tent
without
any
obtrusiveness
the
sent
eight
guards
to
my
camp
at
night
saying
it
was
in
a
very
dangerous
place
and
he
did
not
wish
his
village
disgraced
by
a
stranger
being
robbed
so
near
it
he
added
however
that
six
of
these
men
were
sent
for
his
own
satisfaction
and
that
i
was
only
to
pay
for
the
two
i
had
ordered
my
journey
which
is
through
a
wild
and
little
frequented
part
of
persia
continues
to
be
prosperous
the
climate
is
now
delightful
though
at
these
lower
altitudes
the
middle
of
the
day
is
rather
hot
it
was
a
fertile
and
interesting
country
between
sanjud
and
sain
kala
where
i
halted
for
sunday
the
road
passes
through
the
defiles
of
kavrak
along
with
the
deep
river
karachai
from
the
left
bank
of
which
rises
precipitously
at
the
narrowest
part
of
the
throat
the
fine
mountain
baba
ali
a
long
valley
full
of
cultivation
and
bearing
fine
crops
of
cotton
a
pass
through
the
red
range
of
kizil
kabr
and
a
long
descent
brought
us
to
a
great
alluvial
plain
through
which
passes
the
river
jagatsu
on
its
way
to
the
dead
sea
of
urmi
broad
expanses
of
shingle
trees
and
a
number
of
wide
shingly
witness
to
the
destructiveness
of
this
stream
a
severe
dust
storm
rendered
the
end
of
the
march
very
disagreeable
as
the
path
was
obliterated
and
it
was
often
impossible
to
see
the
ears
in
winter
and
spring
this
jagatsu
valley
is
completely
flooded
and
communication
is
by
boats
there
are
nearly
villages
in
the
district
peopled
almost
entirely
by
kurds
and
turks
and
there
are
over
nomad
tents
the
jagatsu
is
celebrated
for
its
large
fish
when
the
storm
abated
we
were
close
to
sain
kala
a
picturesque
but
ruinous
fort
on
a
spur
of
some
low
hills
with
a
town
of
houses
at
its
base
in
the
eastern
distance
rises
the
fine
mountain
pira
mah
and
between
it
and
sain
kala
is
a
curious
mound
full
of
ashes
the
people
said
a
lofty
truncated
cone
evidently
the
site
of
an
or
this
town
is
in
the
centre
of
a
very
fertile
region
its
gardens
and
orchards
extend
for
at
least
a
mile
in
every
direction
and
its
melons
are
famous
and
cheap
only
a
dozen
just
now
it
is
a
thriving
and
rising
place
a
new
bazar
is
being
built
with
much
decorative
work
in
wood
the
junction
of
the
roads
to
tabriz
from
kirmanshah
and
hamadan
with
one
route
to
urmi
is
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
and
the
place
is
busy
with
the
needs
of
caravans
it
looks
much
like
a
chinese
malay
settlement
having
on
either
side
of
its
long
narrow
roadway
a
row
of
shops
with
rude
verandahs
in
front
among
the
most
prominent
objects
are
horse
mule
and
ass
shoes
rope
and
leather
fruiterers
abound
and
melons
are
piled
up
to
the
roofs
russian
cottons
and
austrian
lamps
and
mirrors
repeat
themselves
down
the
long
uncouth
alley
the
is
outside
the
town
a
windy
and
dusty
plain
here
my
eight
guards
left
me
but
the
shortly
called
with
a
message
from
the
commanding
a
detachment
of
soldiers
and
the
town
saying
that
a
military
guard
would
be
sent
before
sunset
sain
kala
is
in
the
government
of
sujbul
k
and
its
people
are
chiefly
kurds
with
an
admixture
of
turks
a
few
persians
mainly
officials
and
the
solitary
jew
dyer
who
with
his
family
is
found
in
all
the
larger
villages
on
this
route
an
embroidery
needle
was
found
sticking
in
my
a
few
days
ago
and
i
had
the
good
fortune
not
only
to
get
some
coarse
but
some
embroidery
silks
at
sain
kala
and
having
a
piece
of
serge
to
work
on
and
an
outline
of
a
blue
centaurea
i
am
no
longer
destitute
of
light
occupation
for
the
halt
truly
the
sabbath
was
made
for
man
apart
from
any
religious
advantages
life
would
be
very
grinding
and
monotonous
without
the
change
of
occupation
which
it
brings
to
stay
in
bed
till
eleven
to
read
to
rest
the
servants
to
intermit
the
perpetual
to
obtain
recuperation
of
mind
and
body
are
all
advantages
which
help
to
make
sundays
days
on
the
journey
and
last
sunday
was
specially
restful
in
the
afternoon
i
had
a
very
intelligent
visitor
a
from
tabriz
sent
on
sanitary
duty
in
consequence
of
a
cholera
scare
a
flattering
hollow
persian
he
introduced
politics
and
talked
long
on
the
relative
prospects
of
russian
or
english
ascendency
in
asia
england
he
argued
made
a
great
mistake
in
not
annexing
afghanistan
and
his
opinion
he
said
was
shared
by
all
educated
persians
you
are
a
powerful
nation
he
said
but
very
slow
the
people
who
know
nothing
have
too
much
share
in
your
government
to
rule
in
asia
and
you
are
one
of
the
greatest
of
asiatic
powers
one
must
not
introduce
western
theories
of
government
you
must
be
despotic
and
prompt
and
your
policy
must
not
vibrate
see
here
now
the
shah
dies
the
disputes
the
succession
with
the
crown
prince
and
in
a
few
days
russia
occupies
azirbijan
with
men
captures
tihran
and
marches
on
isfahan
meanwhile
your
statesmen
talk
for
weeks
in
parliament
and
when
russia
has
established
her
and
has
organised
persia
then
your
fleet
with
a
small
army
will
sail
from
india
bah
no
country
ruled
by
a
woman
will
rule
in
asia
in
the
evening
the
and
two
other
kurds
hovered
so
much
about
my
tent
that
i
invited
them
into
the
verandah
and
had
a
long
and
pleasant
talk
with
them
finding
them
frank
and
full
of
political
ideas
they
complained
fiercely
of
grinding
exactions
which
they
said
keep
men
poor
all
their
lives
the
poorest
of
men
they
said
have
to
pay
three
a
year
in
money
besides
other
things
and
if
they
ca
pay
in
money
the
seizes
their
stock
puts
a
merely
nominal
value
upon
it
sells
it
at
its
real
value
and
appropriates
the
difference
they
did
not
blame
the
shah
he
knows
nothing
they
execrated
the
governors
and
the
local
officials
if
they
keep
fowls
they
said
they
have
to
keep
them
underground
or
they
would
be
taken
at
the
shah
death
they
said
persia
will
be
divided
between
russia
and
england
and
they
will
fall
to
russia
then
we
shall
get
justice
they
added
i
remarked
that
the
english
and
the
kurds
like
each
other
they
said
then
why
is
england
so
friendly
with
turkey
and
persia
which
oppress
us
and
why
do
travellers
like
you
speak
to
the
sultan
and
the
shah
and
get
things
changed
they
said
that
at
one
time
they
expected
to
fall
under
english
rule
at
the
shah
death
but
now
we
are
told
it
will
be
russia
after
a
long
talk
on
local
affairs
we
turned
to
lighter
subjects
they
were
much
delighted
with
my
bed
and
chair
but
said
that
if
they
once
began
to
use
such
things
it
would
increase
the
cost
of
living
too
much
for
we
would
never
go
back
to
eating
and
sleeping
among
the
spiders
as
mohammedans
do
they
said
they
had
heard
of
europeans
travelling
in
persia
to
see
mines
to
dig
among
ruins
for
treasure
and
to
collect
medicinal
herbs
but
they
could
not
understand
why
i
am
travelling
i
replied
that
i
was
travelling
in
order
to
learn
something
of
the
condition
of
the
people
and
was
interested
likewise
in
their
religion
and
the
prospects
of
christianity
very
good
it
is
well
they
replied
islam
never
recedes
nor
can
christianity
advance
footnotes
apparently
it
was
always
thus
for
on
a
tablet
at
persepolis
occurs
a
passage
in
which
the
vice
of
lying
is
mentioned
as
among
the
external
dangers
which
threatened
the
mighty
empire
of
the
medes
and
persians
says
darius
the
king
may
ormuzd
bring
help
to
me
with
the
deities
who
guard
my
house
and
may
ormuzd
protect
this
province
from
slavery
from
decrepitude
let
not
war
nor
slavery
nor
decrepitude
obtain
power
over
this
province
i
have
very
great
pleasure
in
acknowledging
a
heavy
debt
of
gratitude
to
persian
officials
high
and
low
for
the
courtesy
with
which
i
was
uniformly
treated
it
is
my
practice
in
travelling
to
make
my
arrangements
very
carefully
to
attend
personally
to
every
detail
and
to
give
other
people
as
little
trouble
as
possible
but
in
persia
when
off
the
beaten
track
the
insecurity
of
some
of
the
roads
the
need
of
guards
at
night
when
one
is
living
in
camp
and
the
frequent
insubordination
and
duplicity
of
render
a
reference
to
the
local
authorities
occasionally
imperative
and
not
only
has
the
needed
help
been
given
but
it
has
been
given
and
i
have
always
been
treated
as
respectfully
as
an
english
lady
would
expect
to
be
in
her
own
country
the
general
verdict
of
travellers
in
persia
is
that
misrule
heavy
taxation
the
rapacity
and
villainy
of
local
governors
and
successive
famines
have
reduced
its
small
stationary
population
to
a
condition
of
pitiable
poverty
and
misery
and
this
is
doubtless
true
of
much
of
the
country
and
of
parts
of
it
which
i
have
traversed
myself
but
i
can
only
write
of
things
as
i
found
them
and
on
this
journey
of
miles
from
hamadan
to
urmi
i
heard
comparatively
little
grumbling
many
of
the
villages
are
contented
with
their
taxation
and
landlords
in
others
there
are
decided
evidences
of
prosperity
and
everywhere
there
is
abundance
of
material
comfort
not
according
to
our
ideas
but
theirs
as
to
and
the
condition
of
the
cultivators
of
that
part
of
western
persia
compares
favourably
with
that
of
the
in
many
parts
of
india
but
just
taxation
and
a
complete
reform
in
the
administration
of
justice
are
needed
equally
by
the
prosperous
and
unprosperous
parts
of
persia
the
truth
is
that
since
persia
broke
the
power
of
the
kurds
ten
years
ago
at
the
time
of
the
kurdish
invasion
she
has
kept
a
somewhat
tight
hand
over
them
and
her
success
in
coercing
them
indicates
pretty
plainly
what
turkey
with
her
fine
army
could
do
if
she
were
actually
in
earnest
in
repressing
the
disorder
and
chronic
insecurity
in
turkish
kurdistan

large
village
the
residence
and
property
of
the
this
was
the
wildest
escort
i
have
had
yet
these
men
were
dressed
in
full
kurdish
finery
and
besides
guns
elaborately
inlaid
with
silver
and
ivory
and
swords
in
scabbards
they
carried
daggers
with
hilts
incrusted
with
turquoises
in
their
girdles
they
went
through
all
the
usual
equestrian
performances
and
added
another
which
consists
in
twirling
a
loaded
and
clubbed
stick
in
a
peculiar
manner
and
throwing
it
as
far
ahead
as
possible
while
riding
at
full
gallop
the
one
who
picks
it
up
being
entitled
to
the
next
throw
very
few
succeeded
in
securing
it
in
the
regulation
manner
and
the
scrimmage
for
this
purpose
was
often
on
the
point
of
becoming
a
real
fight
they
worked
themselves
up
to
a
pitch
of
wild
excitement
screamed
yelled
shouted
covered
their
horses
with
sweat
and
foam
nearly
unhorsed
each
other
and
used
their
sharp
bits
so
unmercifully
that
the
mouth
of
every
horse
dripped
with
blood
after
they
received
they
escorted
me
two
miles
farther
to
honour
the
fired
their
guns
in
the
air
salaamed
profoundly
and
with
shrieks
and
yells
left
me
at
a
gallop
the
village
of
muhammad
jik
has
a
bazar
and
an
aspect
of
mixed
prosperity
and
ruin
the
castle
a
large
and
at
a
distance
an
imposing
pile
a
square
fort
with
flanking
towers
is
on
an
eminence
and
has
a
fine
view
of
the
alluvial
plain
of
the
jagatsu
studded
with
villages
and
cultivated
throughout
here
for
a
rarity
the
lives
a
stately
life
among
those
who
are
practically
his
serfs
in
good
old
medieval
fashion
large
offices
are
enclosed
within
an
outer
wall
and
are
inhabited
by
retainers
rows
of
stables
sheltered
a
number
of
fine
and
horses
from
the
sun
bullocks
were
being
brought
in
from
ploughing
there
were
agricultural
implements
of
the
best
persian
type
fowls
ducks
turkeys
angora
goats
negroes
and
negresses
grinning
at
the
stranger
mounted
messengers
with
letters
arriving
and
departing
scribes
in
white
turbans
and
black
robes
lounging
all
the
paraphernalia
of
position
and
wealth
it
was
nearly
nine
and
the
great
man
had
not
risen
but
he
sent
me
a
breakfast
of
tea
cracked
wheat
curds
and
grapes
the
courtyard
is
entered
by
a
really
fine
gateway
and
the
castle
is
built
round
a
quadrangle
the
and
its
fretwork
galleries
are
on
one
side
and
on
another
is
what
may
be
called
a
hall
of
audience
where
the
hears
village
business
and
decides
cases
he
offered
me
a
few
days
hospitality
paid
the
usual
compliments
said
that
no
escort
was
needed
from
thence
to
sujbul
k
where
my
letter
to
the
governor
would
procure
me
one
if
the
roads
were
unsettled
hoped
that
i
should
not
suffer
from
the
hardships
of
the
journey
and
offered
me
a
and
mule
for
the
next
marches
a
level
road
along
the
same
prosperous
alluvial
plain
leads
to
kashava
a
village
of
houses
embosomed
in
fruit
trees
and
surrounded
by
tobacco
and
cotton
it
has
an
old
fort
a
very
fine
spring
and
a
resident
proprietor
who
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
my
arrival
sent
servants
with
melons
and
tea
on
silver
trays
stabled
my
horse
and
provided
me
with
a
strong
guard
as
the
was
much
exposed
to
robbers
such
attentions
though
pleasant
are
very
expensive
as
the
greater
the
master
the
greater
are
the
expectations
of
the
servants
and
the
value
of
such
a
present
as
melons
must
be
at
least
quadrupled
in
while
halting
the
next
day
the
horses
eagerly
ate
the
stalks
and
roots
of
a
bulb
which
lay
almost
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
and
were
simultaneously
seized
with
a
peculiar
affection
their
hair
stood
out
from
their
bodies
like
bristles
and
they
threw
their
heads
up
and
down
with
a
regular
convulsive
and
apparently
perfectly
involuntary
motion
while
their
eyes
were
fixed
and
staring
this
went
on
for
two
hours
following
me
as
usual
but
owing
to
this
most
distressing
jerk
over
which
he
had
no
control
he
was
unable
to
eat
the
dainties
which
his
soul
loves
and
which
i
hoped
would
break
up
the
affection
a
very
painful
one
to
witness
after
the
attack
both
animals
perspired
profusely
the
water
literally
ran
off
their
bodies
the
jerks
gradually
moderated
and
ceased
and
there
were
no
after
effects
but
very
puffy
swellings
about
the
throat
both
had
barley
in
their
but
pawed
and
wriggled
them
off
in
order
to
get
at
this
plant
a
species
of
when
was
well
enough
to
be
mounted
we
descended
into
an
immense
plain
on
which
were
many
villages
and
tracks
this
plain
of
hadji
hussein
is
in
fact
only
another
part
of
the
alluvial
level
of
the
jagatsu
which
with
a
breadth
of
from
four
to
ten
miles
extends
for
nearly
forty
miles
and
is
fertile
and
populous
for
most
of
its
length
at
the
nearest
village
all
the
men
were
busy
at
the
and
they
would
not
give
me
a
guide
at
the
next
the
sent
a
young
man
but
required
payment
in
advance
after
crossing
the
plain
on
which
villages
occur
at
frequent
intervals
on
gravelly
islands
surrounded
by
rich
stiff
black
soil
we
forded
the
broad
jagatsu
and
got
into
the
environs
of
not
an
insignificant
village
as
i
expected
but
an
important
town
of
people
a
wide
road
planted
and
ditched
on
both
sides
with
irrigated
gardens
shaded
by
poplars
willows
and
fruit
trees
runs
for
a
mile
from
the
river
into
the
town
which
is
surrounded
by
similar
gardens
on
every
side
giving
it
the
appearance
of
being
densely
wooded
the
vineyards
are
magnificent
and
the
size
and
flavour
of
the
grapes
quite
unusual
melons
opium
tobacco
cotton
castor
oil
sesamum
and
all
flourish
miandab
is
partly
in
ruins
but
covers
a
great
extent
of
ground
with
its
houses
of
which
are
inhabited
by
jews
and
twenty
by
armenians
people
of
five
tribes
are
found
there
but
unlike
sain
kala
where
sunnis
and
shiahs
live
peaceably
the
mussulmans
are
all
shiahs
no
sunni
having
been
allowed
to
become
a
permanent
inhabitant
since
the
kurdish
attack
ten
years
ago
when
sunnis
within
the
city
betrayed
it
into
the
hands
of
their
it
has
several
mosques
a
good
bazar
with
a
domed
roof
a
part
of
which
displays
very
fine
done
in
the
town
and
a
garrison
of
men
i
saw
the
whole
of
miandab
for
my
caravan
was
lost
and
an
hour
was
spent
in
hunting
for
it
inquiring
of
every
one
if
he
had
seen
a
caravan
of
four
but
vainly
till
we
reached
the
other
side
where
i
found
it
only
just
arrived
and
the
men
busy
in
a
lonely
place
among
prolific
vineyards
sharban
had
lost
the
way
and
after
much
marching
and
had
reached
the
ford
of
the
jagatsu
which
i
had
been
told
to
avoid
where
the
caravan
got
into
deep
strong
water
which
carried
the
off
their
feet
and
he
says
that
they
and
the
servant
were
nearly
drowned
mirza
had
to
go
back
into
the
town
to
obtain
a
guard
from
an
official
as
the
was
very
unsafe
and
it
was
before
dinner
was
ready
the
next
day
i
was
ill
and
rode
only
twelve
miles
for
the
most
part
traversing
the
noble
plain
of
hadji
hussein
till
the
road
ascends
by
tawny
slopes
to
the
wretched
village
of
amirabad
seventeen
hovels
on
a
windy
hill
badly
supplied
with
water
partly
sunk
below
ground
this
village
at
a
short
distance
off
is
only
indicated
by
huge
stacks
of
the
and
tall
cones
of
which
being
neatly
plastered
are
very
superior
in
appearance
to
the
houses
which
they
are
intended
to
warm
the
western
side
of
the
great
plain
was
studded
with
ilyat
camps
of
octagonal
and
tents
with
the
sides
kept
out
by
stout
ribs
great
herds
of
camels
and
flocks
of
big
sheep
varying
in
colour
from
vandyke
brown
to
golden
auburn
camels
carrying
fodder
and
tribesmen
building
it
into
great
stacks
round
which
but
seven
feet
off
they
place
fences
of
a
reed
which
is
abundant
in
swampy
places
gave
life
and
animation
ilyat
women
brought
bowls
of
milk
and
curds
and
offered
me
the
hospitality
of
their
tents
as
i
passed
through
a
herd
of
grazing
camels
an
ancient
beast
ran
at
with
open
mouth
and
a
snarling
growl
poor
literally
gasped
with
terror
courage
is
not
his
strong
point
and
dashed
off
at
a
gallop
and
now
whenever
he
sees
camels
in
the
distance
he
snorts
and
does
his
best
to
bolt
to
one
side
showing
a
cowardice
which
is
really
pitiable
it
was
very
cold
when
i
left
amirabad
the
next
morning
at
and
lay
on
the
ground
the
steadiness
with
which
the
mercury
descends
at
this
season
is
as
interesting
as
its
steady
ascent
in
the
spring
and
its
freedom
from
any
but
the
smallest
fluctuations
in
the
summer
the
road
to
sujbul
k
passes
over
uplands
and
tawny
with
grass
and
after
crossing
some
low
spurs
blue
with
the
lovely
descends
into
a
long
rich
valley
watered
by
the
river
sanak
this
valley
in
which
are
situated
inda
khosh
and
other
large
villages
is
abundantly
irrigated
and
is
cultivated
throughout
well
planted
with
fruit
trees
it
is
a
great
contrast
to
the
arid
fiery
slopes
which
descend
upon
it
long
before
reaching
sujbul
k
there
were
indications
of
the
vicinity
of
a
place
of
some
importance
caravans
going
both
ways
asses
loaded
with
perishable
produce
horsemen
and
foot
passengers
including
many
kurdish
women
unveiled
and
walking
with
a
firm
masculine
stride
even
when
carrying
children
on
their
backs
a
few
miles
from
the
town
two
met
me
but
after
escorting
me
for
some
distance
they
left
me
and
taking
the
wrong
road
i
found
myself
shortly
on
a
slope
above
the
town
not
among
the
living
but
the
dead
such
a
city
of
death
i
have
never
seen
a
whole
hour
was
occupied
in
riding
through
it
without
reaching
its
limits
fifty
thousand
gravestones
are
said
to
stand
on
the
gravel
between
the
hill
and
the
city
wall
mere
unhewn
slabs
of
gray
stone
from
six
inches
to
as
many
feet
in
height
row
beyond
row
to
the
limit
of
vision
people
they
say
are
buried
there
there
is
no
suggestion
of
life
and
immortality
weird
melancholy
and
terribly
malodorous
owing
to
the
shallowness
of
the
graves
the
impression
made
by
this
vast
cemetery
is
solely
painful
the
tombs
are
continued
up
to
the
walls
and
even
among
the
houses
and
having
been
much
disturbed
there
is
the
sad
spectacle
of
human
skulls
and
bones
lying
about
being
gnawed
by
dogs
the
graveyard
side
of
sujbul
k
is
fouler
and
filthier
than
anything
i
have
seen
and
the
odours
even
in
this
beautiful
weather
are
appalling
the
centre
of
each
alley
is
a
broken
channel
with
a
broken
pavement
on
each
side
these
channels
were
obviously
constructed
for
water
but
now
contain
only
a
black
and
stagnant
horror
hardly
to
be
called
a
fluid
choked
with
every
kind
of
refuse
the
bazars
are
narrow
dark
and
busy
full
of
russian
commodities
leather
goods
clothing
melons
grapes
and
the
crowds
of
men
mostly
wore
the
kurdish
or
turkish
costume
but
and
seyyids
and
were
not
wanting
sujbul
k
the
capital
of
northern
persian
kurdistan
and
the
residence
of
a
governor
is
quite
an
important
for
furs
in
which
it
carries
on
a
large
trade
with
russia
and
a
french
firm
it
is
said
buys
up
fur
rugs
to
the
value
of
several
hundred
thousand
francs
annually
it
also
does
a
large
business
with
the
kurdish
tribes
of
the
adjacent
mountains
and
the
turkish
nomads
of
the
plains
and
a
considerable
trade
in
it
has
twenty
small
mosques
three
some
very
inferior
caravanserais
and
a
few
its
meat
bazar
and
its
grain
and
pulse
bazars
are
capacious
and
well
supplied
it
has
a
reputed
population
of
souls
kurds
largely
predominate
but
there
are
so
many
turks
that
the
turkish
government
has
lately
built
a
very
conspicuous
consulate
with
the
aspect
of
a
fortress
and
has
appointed
a
consul
to
protect
the
interests
of
its
subjects
there
are
armenians
who
make
wine
and
and
are
usurers
and
gold
and
silver
smiths
the
jews
get
their
living
by
peddling
drugs
dyeing
cotton
goods
selling
groceries
and
making
gold
and
silver
lace
there
is
a
garrison
of
men
nominally
for
the
town
and
district
are
somewhat
turbulent
and
a
conflict
is
always
imminent
between
the
kurds
and
turks
who
are
sunnis
and
the
small
persian
population
which
is
shiah
the
altitude
of
sujbul
k
is
feet
here
i
have
come
upon
the
track
of
ida
pfeiffer
who
travelled
in
the
urmi
region
more
than
forty
years
ago
when
travelling
in
persia
was
full
of
risks
and
much
more
difficult
in
all
respects
than
it
is
now
illustration
kurd
of
sujbul
the
sanak
though
clear
and
bright
is
fouled
by
many
abominations
and
by
the
ceaseless
washing
of
clothes
above
the
town
there
are
no
pure
wells
and
all
people
who
care
about
what
they
drink
keep
asses
constantly
bringing
water
from
an
uncontaminated
part
of
the
river
two
miles
off
even
the
governor
has
to
depend
on
this
supply
sujbul
k
looks
very
well
from
this
camp
with
the
bright
river
in
the
foreground
and
above
it
irregularly
grouped
on
a
rising
bank
the
façade
terraces
and
towers
of
the
governor
palace
the
turkish
consulate
and
numbers
of
good
with
painted
blue
or
pink
or
covered
with
arabesques
in
red
with
projecting
lattice
windows
of
dark
wood
and
balconies
overhanging
the
water
this
shingle
where
i
am
encamped
is
the
rotten
row
of
the
town
and
is
very
lively
this
evening
for
numbers
of
kurds
have
been
galloping
their
horses
here
and
performing
feats
of
horsemanship
before
the
admiring
eyes
of
hundreds
of
promenaders
male
and
female
most
of
the
latter
unveiled
as
all
have
to
cross
the
ford
where
the
river
is
some
inches
above
a
man
knees
the
effect
is
grotesque
and
even
the
women
have
no
objection
to
displaying
their
round
white
limbs
in
the
clear
water
the
ladies
of
the
governor
sent
word
that
food
and
quarters
had
been
prepared
for
me
since
noon
but
i
excused
myself
on
the
plea
of
excessive
fatigue
this
message
was
followed
by
a
visit
from
the
governor
an
unveiled
jolly
woman
of
redundant
proportions
wearing
remarkably
short
petticoats
which
displayed
limbs
like
pillars
a
small
woman
attended
her
and
a
number
of
kurd
men
superbly
dressed
and
wearing
short
swords
with
ebony
hilts
ornamented
with
incrustations
of
very
filigree
silver
these
weapons
are
made
here
the
lady
has
been
to
mecca
and
evinces
much
more
general
intelligence
than
the
secluded
women
she
took
a
dagger
from
one
of
the
attendants
and
showed
me
with
much
go
how
the
thrusts
which
kill
are
made
all
were
much
amused
with
gentle
ways
he
had
been
into
the
town
for
supplies
and
as
usual
asked
me
to
take
off
his
bridle
by
coming
up
and
putting
his
ears
under
my
chin
when
if
i
do
not
attend
to
him
at
once
he
lifts
his
head
and
gives
me
a
gentle
push
or
rubs
his
nose
against
my
cheek
the
men
admired
his
strong
clean
limbs
which
are
his
best
points
last
night
i
heard
snoring
very
near
me
and
thinking
that
the
watchmen
were
sleeping
under
the
i
went
out
to
waken
them
and
found
the
big
beast
stretched
out
fast
asleep
in
the
verandah
of
the
tent
having
retired
there
for
warmth
i
accompanied
my
visitors
to
the
ford
followed
by
to
their
great
amusement
as
it
was
to
mine
to
see
the
stout
lady
mount
nimbly
on
a
kurd
back
and
ride
him
pickaback
through
the
water
this
has
not
been
a
comfortable
afternoon
the
governor
has
been
out
all
day
hunting
and
his
deputy
either
at
the
bath
or
a
religious

johannes
who
is

disobedient
as
well
as
incompetent
has
brought
no

food
and
poor
has
been
calling
for
it
for
two
hours
coming
into
my
tent
shaking
the
bag
in
which
the
barley
is
usually
kept
and
actually
in
his
hunger
clearing
the
table
of
melons
and
grapes
these
however
are
only
among
the
very
small
annoyances
of
travelling
the

has
returned
and
has
sent
a

with

turkman
rising
very
early
on
friday
morning
to
keep
my
appointment
with
the
ladies
of
the
governor
of
sujbul
k
as
well
as
to
obtain
a
letter
from
him
i
reached
the
palace
entrance
a
little
after
sunrise
the
hour
agreed
upon
the
walls
and
gateway
are
crumbling
the
courtyard
is
in
heaps
the
glass
windows
of
the
façade
and
towers
are
much
broken
the
plaster
is
mangy
a
complete
disappointment
the
kurdish
guard
slept
soundly
at
the
entrance
only
a
big
dog
more
faithful
than
man
was
on
the
alert
the
governor
was
not
yet
awake
nor
the
ladies
it
would
be
an
intolerable
crime
the
sentry
said
to
waken
them
he
looked
as
if
he
thought
it
an
intolerable
crime
that
his
own
surreptitious
slumbers
had
been
disturbed
it
is
contrary
to
persian
etiquette
to
waken
persons
of
distinction
till
they
please
i
waited
at
the
entrance
for
half
an
hour
and
then
reluctantly
departed
very
sorry
not
to
give
the
ladies
the
opportunity
they
ardently
desired
of
seeing
a
european
woman
they
had
sent
word
that
they
had
only
once
in
their
lives
seen
one
the
march
to
the
poor
village
of
mehemetabad
was
over
uninteresting
low
rounded
hills
and
through
a
valley
without
habitations
opening
upon
a
fine
plain
at
the
end
of
which
the
village
stands
the
was
a
green
fallow
near
some
willows
and
a
stream
after
marching
for
some
hours
under
a
glittering
sky
and
a
hot
sun
over
scorched
glaring
yellow
soil
a
measure
of
greenness
just
round
the
tent
is
most
refreshing
to
eyes
which
are
suffering
from
the
want
of
the
coloured
glasses
which
were
ground
under
a
hoofs
a
fortnight
ago
the
khan
of
the
village
was
very
courteous
and
sent
a
tray
of
splendid
grapes
and
six
watchmen
buffalo
bulls
of
very
large
size
were
used
there
for
burden
buffaloes
are
a
sure
sign
of
mitigated
aridity
for
they
must
bathe
lie
down
in
water
three
times
daily
if
they
are
to
be
kept
in
health
and
if
the
water
and
mud
are
not
deep
enough
for
this
boys
go
in
along
with
them
and
pour
water
over
them
with
a
pannikin
in
these
regions
they
are
almost
exclusively
used
for
burdens
draught
and
milk
and
everywhere
their
curved
flat
horns
and
sweet
calm
silly
faces
are
to
be
seen
above
the
water
of
the
deep
irrigation
ditches
the
buffalo
though
usually
mild
enough
to
be
driven
by
small
children
has
an
uncertain
temper
and
can
be
roused
to
frightful
ferocity
in
persian
kurdistan
if
not
elsewhere
this
is
taken
advantage
of
and
in
the
spring
when
the
animals
are
in
good
condition
after
the
winter
rest
the
people
have
buffalo
fights
in
which
cruel
injuries
would
be
inflicted
were
it
not
for
the
merciful
provision
of
nature
in
giving
these
animals
flat
incurved
horns
as
i
sat
at
my
tent
door
a
cloud
of
dust
moved
along
the
road
towards
the
village
escorting
an
indefinite
something
which
loomed
monstrously
through
it
i
have
not
seen
a
cart
for
nine
months
and
till
the
unmistakable
creak
of
wooden
wheels
enlightened
me
i
could
not
think
what
was
approaching
actually
every
village
on
these
plains
has
one
or
more
with
wooden
wheels
without
tires
and
hubs
and
axles
of
enormous
size
and
strength
usually
drawn
by
four
buffaloes
a
man
sits
on
the
front
of
the
cart
and
drives
with
a
stick
and
a
boy
sits
on
the
yoke
between
the
two
foremost
beasts
he
croons
a
perpetual
song
and
if
this
ceases
the
buffaloes
stop
for
every
added
pair
and
on
the
next
plain
i
saw
as
many
as
six
yoke
there
is
an
additional
boy
and
an
additional
song
this
apparition
carried
a
light
wooden
frame
which
was
loaded
to
a
preposterous
height
with
the
strong
reeds
which
are
used
to
support
the
mud
roofs
heavily
weighted
as
these
are
with
stacks
of
fodder
one
would
think
one
was
in
the
heart
of
the
bakhtiari
country
and
not
on
a
caravan
route
from
the
difficulty
of
getting
any
correct
guidance
as
to
the
road
distance
safety
or
otherwise
etc
sharban
has
never
been
this
way
and
is
the
prey
of
every
rumour
between
his
terror
of
having
to
eat
wood
on
his
return
and
his
dread
of
being
attacked
and
robbed
of
his
he
leads
an
uneasy
life
and
when
as
at
mehemetabad
there
is
no
yard
for
his
animals
he
watches
all
night
in
the
idea
that
the
guards
are
the
worst
robbers
of
all
i
think
he
has
all
the
mussulman
distrust
of
arrangements
made
by
a
woman
hitherto
the
guards
have
been
faithful
and
quiet
i
always
ask
them
not
to
talk
after
and
i
have
not
once
been
disturbed
by
them
and
when
i
walk
as
usual
twice
round
the
camp
during
the
night
i
always
find
them
awake
by
their
big
the
village
khan
an
intelligent
man
spent
some
time
with
me
in
the
afternoon
the
fields
of
his
village
are
not
manured
at
all
and
the
yield
is
only
about
tenfold
willows
are
grown
for
the
sake
of
the
osiers
which
are
a
necessity
and
not
for
fuel
and
the
whole
of
the
manure
is
required
for
cooking
and
heating
purposes
he
said
that
his
village
becomes
poorer
annually
owing
to
the
heavier
exactions
of
the
officials
and
the
larger
sums
demanded
to
buy
off
robbers
the
latter
is
a
complaint
often
made
in
the
villages
which
are
near
the
turkish
frontier
a
boundary
which
from
all
accounts
needs
considerable
rectification
the
people
say
that
kurds
cross
the
border
and
that
unless
they
bribe
them
they
drive
off
their
sheep
and
cattle
and
get
over
it
again
safely
but
i
doubt
the
truth
of
these
statements
i
got
away
at
sunrise
for
a
march
of
nominally
fourteen
miles
but
in
reality
sharban
not
only
stated
the
distance
falsely
but
induced
others
to
do
the
same
thing
and
when
he
passed
me
at
midday
saying
the
was
only
two
miles
ahead
he
went
on
for
twelve
miles
his
desire
being
to
rejoin
that
bugbear
the
big
caravan
which
he
heard
had
reached
urmi
the
result
is
that
i
have
had
to
rest
for
two
days
and
he
has
gained
two
days
pay
but
has
lost
time
after
some
serious
difficulties
in
crossing
some
swampy
streams
and
a
pitiable
display
of
cowardice
on
part
we
embarked
on
the
magnificent
plain
of
sulduz
where
johannes
with
a
supreme
which
imposed
on
me
took
the
wrong
one
of
two
tracks
and
we
rode
west
instead
of
east
to
within
a
few
hours
journey
of
a
pass
into
turkey
through
the
magnificent
range
of
the
zibar
mountains
which
even
at
this
advanced
season
are
in
some
places
heavily
patched
with
last
winter
snow
to
regain
the
caravan
route
we
had
to
cross
the
greater
part
of
this
grand
plain
which
i
had
not
then
seen
equalled
in
persia
for
fertility
and
population
it
possesses
that
crown
of
blessings
an
abundant
water
supply
indeed
so
abundant
that
in
the
spring
it
is
a
swamp
and
the
spring
sowing
is
delayed
till
may
it
has
several
large
villages
slightly
raised
and
well
planted
a
few
of
them
with
the
large
fortified
houses
of
resident
proprietors
overtopping
the
smaller
dwellings
evidences
of
material
prosperity
meet
the
eye
everywhere
a
prosperity
which
needs
to
be
guarded
however
for
every
shepherd
cowherd
ploughman
and
goes
about
his
work
armed
large
herds
of
mares
with
mule
foals
of
big
fat
cattle
and
of
buffaloes
with
plenty
of
mud
to
wallow
in
stacks
of
real
hay
and
of
fine
reeds
buffalo
carts
moving
slowly
near
all
the
villages
carrying
the
hay
into
security
grass
uncut
and
unscorched
eighteen
inches
high
a
deep
black
stoneless
soil
impassable
at
certain
seasons
towering
cones
of
animal
fuel
for
export
as
well
as
use
an
intensely
blue
sky
above
a
cool
breeze
and
the
rare
sight
of
drifting
over
waving
grass
and
flecking
the
cobalt
sides
of
the
zibar
mountains
combined
to
form
a
picture
i
would
not
willingly
have
missed
impatient
as
i
was
for
the
first
view
of
the
sea
of
urmi
beyond
there
are
low
stony
hills
which
would
be
absolutely
bare
now
but
for
the
and
the
showy
spikes
of
a
great
yellow
mullein
a
salt
lake
most
of
which
is
now
a
salt
incrustation
mimicking
ice
from
beneath
which
the
water
has
been
withdrawn
but
with
an
odour
which
no
ice
ever
has
then
a
gradual
ascent
to
a
windy
ridge
and
then
the
dead
sea
of
urmi
or
urumiya
dead
indeed
it
looked
from
that
point
of
view
and
dead
were
its
surroundings
it
lay
a
sheet
of
blue
bluer
even
than
the
heavens
above
it
stretching
northwards
beyond
the
limits
of
vision
and
bounded
on
the
east
but
very
far
away
by
low
blue
ranges
seen
faintly
through
a
blue
veil
on
the
west
side
there
are
mountains
which
recede
considerably
and
descend
upon
it
in
low
rounded
buff
slopes
or
downs
over
which
the
track
keeping
near
the
water
lies
there
was
not
a
green
thing
not
a
bush
or
house
or
flock
of
sheep
or
horseman
or
foot
passenger
along
the
miles
of
road
which
were
visible
from
that
point
the
water
lay
in
the
mocking
beauty
of
its
brilliant
colouring
a
sea
without
a
shore
without
a
boat
without
a
ripple
or
flash
of
foam
lifeless
utterly
dead
from
all
time
past
to
all
time
to
come
dead
too
it
is
on
closer
acquaintance
and
its
odour
which
can
be
discerned
three
miles
off
is
that
odour
of
corruption
known
to
science
as
sulphuretted
hydrogen
now
and
then
there
is
a
shore
a
shallow
bay
or
inlet
in
which
the
lake
driven
by
the
east
wind
evaporates
leaving
behind
it
a
glaring
crust
of
salt
beyond
which
a
thick
bubbly
scum
lies
on
the
blue
water
in
such
places
only
the
expressive
word
can
describe
the
odour
which
was
strong
enough
nearly
to
knock
over
the
servants
and
no
description
can
give
an
idea
of
the
effluvium
which
is
met
with
here
and
there
beside
this
great
salt
lake
which
has
a
length
of
eighty
miles
and
an
average
breadth
of
a
few
miles
from
dissa
the
is
brought
into
tanks
and
evaporated
and
many
donkeys
were
being
loaded
with
the
product
which
like
all
salt
which
is
sold
in
persia
is
impure
and
for
european
use
always
requires
a
domestic
and
tedious
process
of
purification
after
a
solitude
of
several
miles
villages
appear
lying
off
the
road
in
folds
of
the
hills
which
gradually
recede
so
far
as
to
leave
a
plain
some
miles
broad
and
very
fertile
at
the
end
of
an
eleven
hours
march
we
reached
the
important
village
of
dissa
with
large
houses
and
orchards
abundant
water
a
detachment
of
soldiers
as
a
garrison
a
resident
proprietor
house
to
which
in
his
absence
i
was
at
once
invited
by
his
wife
and
so
surrounded
by
cultivation
that
a
vacant
space
could
only
be
found
for
the
camp
in
a
the
caravan
had
only
just
come
in
and
there
was
neither
fuel
nor
drinking
water
within
easy
reach
i
was
so
completely
worn
out
that
i
was
lifted
off
the
horse
and
laid
on
the
ground
in
blankets
till
the
camp
was
in
order
late
at
night
sharban
knowing
that
his
deception
was
discovered
had
disappeared
with
his
without
helping
as
usual
to
pitch
my
tent
mirza
always
cheerful
and
though
always
slow
and
johannes
did
their
best
but
it
is
very
hard
on
servants
who
are
up
before
five
not
to
bring
them
in
till
sunset
when
their
work
is
scarcely
over
till
near
midnight
and
has
to
be
done
in
the
dark
the
next
day
there
were
a
succession
of
dust
storms
and
half
a
gale
from
noon
to
sunset
but
my
tent
stood
it
well
and
the
following
day
this
was
repeated
these
strong
winds
usually
prevail
in
the
afternoon
at
this
season
october
a
march
over
low
and
hills
an
easy
descent
and
a
ford
brought
us
down
upon
the
plain
of
urmi
the
paradise
of
persia
and
to
the
pleasant
and
friendly
hamlet
of
turkman
where
i
spent
the
night
and
made
the
into
urmi
yesterday
morning
this
plain
is
truly
paradise
as
seen
from
the
hill
above
it
nor
can
i
say
that
its
charm
disappears
on
more
intimate
acquaintance
far
from
it
i
have
travelled
now
for
nine
months
in
persia
and
know
pretty
well
what
to
expect
not
to
look
for
surprises
of
beauty
and
luxuriance
and
to
be
satisfied
with
occasional
oases
of
cultivation
among
brown
rocky
treeless
hills
varied
by
brown
villages
with
crops
and
spindly
poplars
and
willows
contrasting
with
the
harsh
barrenness
of
the
surrounding
gravelly
waste
but
beautiful
urmi
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
is
one
oasis
from
turkman
onwards
the
plain
becomes
more
and
more
attractive
the
villages
closer
together
the
variety
of
trees

shaded
by

passing
away

nature

perfected
her

in

without
its
gloom

while
the

are
at
work
this
picture
of
beauty
fertility
and
industry
is
framed
by
the
kurdistan
mountains
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
by
long
lines
of
poplars
through
which
there
are

grandly
with
the
luxuriant
plains
of
sulduz

urmi
as
i
passed
northwards
the

thicker
the
many

the
road
passes
through
beautiful
orchards
with
green
sward
beneath
the
trees
mud
walls
are
on
both
sides
and
over
them
droop
the
graceful
boughs
and
foliage
of
an
with
its
tresses
of
auburn
fruit
at
the
large
village
of
a
young
horseman
overtook
me
and
said
in
my
native
tongue
can
you
speak
english
he
proved
to
be
a
graduate
of
the
american
college
at
urmi
and
a
teacher
in
school
known
better
to
his
supporters
in
england
as
deacon
abraham
he
told
me
that
i
was
expected
and
shortly
afterwards
i
was
greeted
by
the
son
of
the
oldest
missionary
in
urmi
labaree
the
remaining
four
miles
were
almost
entirely
under
the
shade
of
fine
trees
past
the
city
walls
and
gates
put
into
tolerable
repair
after
the
kurdish
invasion
ten
years
ago
and
out
into
pretty
wooded
country
with
the
grand
mountains
of
the
frontier
seen
through
the
trees
where
a
fine
gateway
admitted
us
into
the
park
in
which
are
the
buildings
of
the
american
presbyterian
mission
now
more
than
half
a
century
old
these
are
on
high
ground
well
timbered
and
the
glimpses
through
the
trees
of
the
mountains
and
the
plain
are
enchanting
through
the
kindness
of
my
friends
at
hamadan
who
had
written
in
advance
i
am
made
welcome
in
the
house
of
shedd
the
principal
of
the
urmi
college
within
two
hours
of
my
arrival
i
had
the
pleasure
of
visits
from
canon
maclean
and
lang
of
the
english
mission
and
from
labaree
and
the
ladies
of
the
fiske
seminary
the
english
french
and
american
missionaries
being
the
only
european
residents
in
urmi
footnotes
while
i
was
sleeping
in
a
buffalo
stable
in
turkey
two
buffaloes
quarrelled
and
there
was
a
terrible
fight
in
which
the
huge
animals
interlocked
their
horns
and
broke
them
short
off
bellowing
fearfully
it
took
twenty
men
with
ropes
or
rather
cables
two
and
a
half
inches
in
diameter
which
are
kept
for
the
purpose
to
separate
them
and
their
thin
skins
sensitive
to
insect
bites
and
all
irritations
were
bleeding
in
every
direction
before
they
could
be
forced
apart
christian
women
and
girls
share
the
work
of
the
fields
with
the
men
it
is
a
pleasant
duty
to
record
here
the
undeserved
and
exceeding
kindness
that
i
have
met
with
from
the
american
presbyterian
and
congregational
missionaries
in
persia
and
asia
minor
it
is
not
only
that
they
made
a
stranger
although
a
member
of
the
anglican
church
welcome
in
their
refined
and
cultured
homes
often
putting
themselves
to
considerable
inconvenience
in
order
to
receive
me
but
that
they
ungrudgingly
imparted
to
me
the
interests
of
their
work
and
lives
helping
me
at
the
cost
of
much
valuable
time
and
trouble
with
the
complicated
and
often
difficult
arrangements
for
my
farther
journeys
showing
in
every
possible
way
that
they
know
the
heart
of
a
stranger
being
themselves
strangers
in
a
strange
land
specially
i
feel
bound
to
acknowledge
the
kindness
and
hospitality
shown
to
me
by
the
presbyterian
missionaries
in
urmi
who
were
aware
that
one
object
of
my
journey
through
persia
was
to
visit
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
assyrian
missions
which
work
on
different
and
i
may
say
opposite
lines
from
their
own
notes
on
protestant
missions
in
urmi
a
sketch
of
urmi
would
present
few
features
of
general
interest
if
it
did
not
embrace
an
outline
of
the
mission
work
which
is
carried
on
there
on
a
large
scale
first
by
the
numerous
agents
lay
and
clerical
male
and
female
of
the
american
presbyterian
board
of
foreign
missions
and
next
by
the
english
mission
clergy
and
the
sisters
of
bethany
who
form
what
is
known
as
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
mission
to
the
assyrian
christians
besides
these
there
is
a
latin
mission
of
french
lazarists
aided
by
sisters
of
vincent
de
paul
which
has
been
at
work
in
urmi
and
on
the
plain
of
salmas
for
forty
years
urmi
the
reputed
birthplace
of
zoroaster
and
in
past
ages
the
great
centre
of
fire
worship
was
made
the
headquarters
of
the
american
mission
to
the
nestorians
in
which
with
the
exception
of
the
mission
in
julfa
was
the
only
protestant
mission
in
persia
up
to
the
year
at
present
there
are
four
ordained
american
missionaries
several
ladies
and
a
medical
missionary
working
in
urmi
under
their
superintendence
are
thirty
ordained
and
licentiate
pastors
native
helpers
and
three
the
number
of
nestorians
or
syrians
employed
as
teachers
in
the
college
and
the
fiske
seminary
for
girls
as
translators
as
printers
and
as
medical
assistants
is
very
considerable
the
whole
plain
of
urmi
with
its
innumerable
villages
and
the
eastern
portion
of
the
kurdish
mountains
with
its
syrian
hamlets
are
included
within
the
sphere
of
mission
work
this
mission
has
free
access
to
syrians
armenians
and
jews
but
for
moslems
there
can
be
no
public
preaching
or
teaching
nor
can
a
moslem
openly
profess
christianity
or
even
frequent
the
syrian
services
without
being
a
marked
man
hence
while
all
opportunities
are
embraced
of
conversation
with
mohammedans
and
of
circulating
the
bible
among
them
the
mission
work
is
chiefly
among
nominal
christians
the
americans
own
a
very
large
amount
of
property
at
urmi
the
fiske
seminary
a
high
school
in
which
a
large
number
of
girls
receive
board
as
well
as
education
is
within
the
city
walls
as
well
as
some
of
the
houses
of
both
clerical
and
lady
missionaries
about
a
mile
outside
they
have
acquired
a
beautiful
and
valuable
estate
of
about
fifteen
acres
plentifully
wooded
and
watered
and
with
some
fine
avenues
of
planes
on
this
are
the
large
buildings
of
the
urmi
college
the
professors
houses
the
dispensary
and
the
medical
mission
hospitals
for
the
sick
of
both
sexes
a
very
education
is
given
in
the
urmi
college
and
in
addition
to
the
general
course
there
are
opportunities
for
both
theological
and
medical
education
last
year
there
were
students
of
which
number
eighteen
graduated
the
education
given
is
bringing
about
a
result
which
was
not
anticipated
the
educated
syrian
and
armenian
young
men
far
from
desiring
generally
to
remain
in
their
own
country
as
pastors
and
teachers
and
finding
no
opportunities
of
getting
on
otherwise
have
of
late
been
seized
with
a
craze
for
leaving
persia
for
america
russia
or
any
other
country
where
they
may
turn
their
education
to
profitable
account
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
the
admirable
training
and
education
given
in
the
fiske
seminary
do
not
produce
a
like
restlessness
among
its
girl
graduates
the
girls
marry
at
an
early
age
make
good
housewives
and
are
in
the
main
intelligent
and
kindly
christians
possibly
the
education
given
in
the
urmi
college
is
too
high
and
too
western
for
the
requirements
of
the
country
and
the
probable
future
of
the
students
at
all
events
similar
regrets
were
expressed
in
urmi
as
i
afterwards
heard
regarding
some
of
the
american
mission
colleges
in
asia
minor
the
missionaries
say
that
the
directly
religious
results
are
not
so
apparent
as
could
be
desired
that
the
young
men
are
not
ready
to
offer
themselves
in
any
numbers
for
evangelistic
work
and
that
the
present
tendency
is
to
seek
secular
employment
and
personal
aggrandisement
though
this
secular
tendency
comes
forward
strongly
at
this
time
a
number
of
evangelistic
workers
scattered
through
persia
turkey
and
russia
owe
their
education
and
religious
inspiration
to
the
teachings
of
the
urmi
college
at
present
a
few
of
the
young
men
have
banded
themselves
together
to
go
forth
as
teachers
and
preachers
with
the
object
of
carrying
the
gospel
to
all
without
distinction
of
nationality
the
hopefulness
of
this
movement
is
that
it
is
of
native
origin
and
that
the
young
men
are
a
capable
syrian
physician
and
a
companion
are
also
preaching
and
healing
at
their
own
cost
only
accepting
help
towards
the
expense
of
medicines
the
medical
mission
at
urmi
with
its
dispensary
and
its
two
admirable
hospitals
is
of
the
utmost
value
as
such
missions
are
all
the
world
over
cochrane
from
his
courtesy
and
attention
to
the
niceties
of
persian
etiquette
is
extremely
acceptable
to
the
persian
authorities
and
has
been
entrusted
by
them
more
than
once
with
missions
involving
the
exercise
of
great
tact
and
ability
he
is
largely
trusted
by
the
moslems
of
urmi
and
the
neighbourhood
and
mixes
with
them
socially
on
friendly
and
easy
terms
he
and
some
of
the
younger
missionaries
were
born
in
persia
their
fathers
having
been
missionaries
before
them
and
after
completing
their
education
in
america
they
returned
not
only
with
an
intimate
knowledge
of
etiquette
and
custom
as
well
as
of
syriac
and
persian
but
with
that
thorough
sympathy
with
the
people
whom
they
are
there
to
help
and
instruct
which
it
is
difficult
to
gain
in
a
single
generation
and
through
languages
not
acquired
in
childhood
cochrane
has
had
many
and
curious
dealings
with
the
kurds
the
dreaded
inhabitants
of
the
mountains
which
overhang
the
beautiful
plain
of
urmi
and
a
kurd
who
appears
to
be
in
perpetual
is
the
gatekeeper
at
the
dispensary
one
of
the
most
singular
results
of
the
influence
gained
over
these
fierce
and
predatory
people
by
the
missionary
occurred
in
when
obeidullah
khan
with
kurds
laid
siege
to
urmi
six
months
previously
at
this
khan
request
cochrane
went
up
a
three
days
journey
into
the
mountains
where
he
remained
for
ten
days
during
which
time
he
cured
the
khan
of
severe
pneumonia
and
made
the
acquaintance
of
several
of
the
kurdish
chiefs
before
the
siege
began
obeidullah
khan
sent
for
cochrane
saying
that
he
wished
to
know
his
residence
and
who
his
people
were
so
as
to
see
that
none
of
them
suffered
at
the
hands
of
his
men
not
only
this
but
he
asked
for
the
names
of
the
christian
villages
on
the
plain
and
gave
the
letters
with
orders
that
nothing
should
be
touched
which
belonged
to
them
the
mission
families
were
assembled
at
the
college
and
christians
with
their
cattle
and
horses
took
refuge
in
the
college
grounds
which
were
close
to
the
kurdish
lines
the
siege
lasted
seven
weeks
with
great
loss
of
life
and
many
of
the
horrors
of
war
as
time
increased
the
fury
of
both
kurds
and
persians
but
obeidullah
kept
his
word
and
for
the
sake
of
the
and
his
healing
art
not
only
was
not
a
hair
on
the
head
of
any
missionary
touched
but
the
mixed
multitude
within
the
gates
and
the
herds
were
likewise
spared
cochrane
the
widow
of
the
former
medical
missionary
superintends
the
food
and
the
nursing
in
the
hospitals
and
i
doubt
whether
the
most
fanatical
kurd
or
persian
moslem
could
remain
indifferent
to
the
charm
of
her
bright
and
loving
presence
the
profession
of
cochrane
opens
to
him
homes
and
hearts
everywhere
all
hold
him
as
a
friend
and
benefactor
and
he
has
opportunities
denied
to
all
others
of
expounding
the
christian
faith
among
moslems
a
letter
from
him
is
a
through
some
parts
of
the
kurdish
mountains
and
the
mere
mention
of
his
name
is
a
passport
to
the
of
their
fierce
inhabitants
the
work
of
the
mission
is
not
confined
to
the
city
of
urmi
among
the
villages
of
the
plain
there
are
schools
taught
chiefly
in
syriac
seven
of
which
are
for
girls
only
the
mission
ladies
itinerate
largely
and
are
warmly
welcomed
by
moslem
as
well
as
christian
women
and
even
by
those
families
of
kurds
who
since
their
defeat
in
have
settled
down
to
peaceful
pursuits
some
of
them
even
becoming
christians
in
fifty
years
the
american
missionaries
have
gained
a
very
considerable
and
influence
not
only
by
labours
which
are
recognised
as
disinterested
but
by
the
purity
and
righteousness
of
their
lives
and
the
increased
friendliness
and
accessibility
of
the
moslems
of
urmi
give
hope
that
the
purer
teachings
of
christianity
and
the
example
of
the
life
of
our
lord
are
regarded
by
them
with
less
of
hostility
or
indifference
than
formerly
the
history
of
the
mission
is
best
given
in
the
words
of
shedd
one
of
its
oldest
members
the
communicants
of
the
evangelical
syriac
church
which
might
be
termed
from
its
organisation
and
creed
the
syriac
numbered
in
and
in
apart
from
the
results
of
christian
teaching
and
example
there
can
be
i
think
no
doubt
that
the
residence
of
righteous
foreigners
in
urmi
for
over
half
a
century
has
had
a
most
beneficial
effect
on
the
condition
of
the
nestorians
at
the
time
when
the
first
american
missionaries
settled
in
urmi
the
yoke
of
islam
was
hardly
bearable
the
christians
were
oppressed
and
plundered
their
daughters
were
taken
by
violence
and
they
were
scarcely
allowed
to
practise
the
little
religion
left
to
them
the
persian
government
sensitive
as
it
is
to
european
opinion
has
gradually
remedied
a
state
of
matters
upon
which
the
reports
of
the
missionaries
were
justly
to
be
dreaded
and
at
the
present
time
the
christians
of
urmi
and
the
adjacent
plain
have
comparatively
very
little
to
complain
of
at
the
same
time
the
syriac
church
was
at
its
lowest
ebb
absolutely
sunk
in
ignorance
and
superstition
it
had
no
exposition
of
the
bible
and
all
worship
was
in
the
ancient
syriac
tongue
then
as
now
not
understanded
of
the
people
it
had
no
books
or
any
ability
to
establish
schools
bibles
were
scarce
and
a
single
copy
of
the
psalms
could
not
be
bought
for
less
than
the
learned
nuns
and
deaconesses
of
the
early
days
were
without
successors
women
were
entirely
neglected
and
it
was
regarded
as
improper
for
the
younger
among
them
to
be
seen
at
church
in
urmi
not
a
woman
could
read
and
in
the
whole
nestorian
region
they
were
absolutely
illiterate
with
the
exception
of
the
patriarch
sister
and
two
or
three
nuns
the
translation
of
the
bible
into
modern
syriac
a
noble
work
now
undergoing
revision
the
college
the
female
seminary
the
translation
and
publication
of
many
luminous
books
the
circulation
of
a
periodical
called
of
together
with
fifty
years
of
intercourse
with
men
and
women
whose
chief
aim
is
the
religious
and
intellectual
elevation
of
the
people
among
whom
they
dwell
have
wrought
a
remarkable
change
though
that
the
change
is
menaced
with
perils
and
is
not
an
absolutely
unmixed
good
can
not
be
gainsaid
it
is
for
the
future
to
decide
whether
the
reform
movement
in
umri
or
elsewhere
could
survive
in
any
strength
the
removal
of
the
agency
which
inaugurated
it
and
whether
a
church
without
a
ritual
and
with
a
form
of
government
alien
to
the
genius
of
the
east
and
the
traditions
of
the
fathers
can
take
root
in
the
affections
of
an
eminently
conservative
people
the
mission
founded
by
the
present
archbishop
of
canterbury
at
the
request
of
the
of
the
east
mar
shimun
the
patriarch
of
the
syrian
church
arrived
in
urmi
in
the
autumn
of
at
the
time
of
my
visit
it
consisted
of
five
mission
priests
graduates
of
oxford
and
cambridge
universities
and
an
ordained
syrian
four
of
whom
were
at
the
headquarters
in
urmi
one
in
the
kurdish
mountains
and
one
on
the
urmi
plain
four
sisters
of
bethany
arrived
in
the
spring
of
for
the
purpose
of
opening
a
for
girls
and
instructing
the
women
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
the
lines
on
which
the
anglican
and
american
missions
proceed
are
diametrically
different
and
the
modes
of
working
are
necessarily
in
opposition
the
one
is
a
proselytising
agency
and
labours
to
build
up
a
presbyterian
church
in
persia
the
other
purposes
to
bring
back
an
ancient
church
into
the
way
of
truth
and
so
prepare
it
for
its
union
with
its
mother
church
the
orthodox
church
of
the
east
the
objects
of
the
latter
and
its
ecclesiastical
position
are
stated
briefly
in
the
note
below
the
actual
work
to
be
done
by
the
mission
is
thus
summed
up
by
its
promoters
the
work
of
the
mission
is
in
the
first
place
to
train
up
a
body
of

and
of
which
the

primitive
character
is
shown
by
their

the
mission
in
no
way
seeks
to
anglicanise
the
assyrians
on
the
one
hand
nor
on
the
other
to
condone
the
heresy
which
separated
them
from

it
is

it

and

it
has
one
high
school
at
urmi
for
boys
under
seventeen
and
two
upon
the
urmi
plain
but
the
work
to
which
these
may
be
regarded
as
subsidiary
is
the
urmi
upper
school
for
priests
deacons
and
candidates
for
holy
orders
in
these
four
establishments
there
are
about
pupils
mostly
boarders
there
are
also

the
total

the

their
food
and

of
living
are
strictly
oriental
all
imitations
of
western
manners
and
customs
are
forbidden
the
policy
of
the
mission
being
to
make
the
syrians
take
a
pride
in
their
national
customs
which
as
a
rule
are
adapted
to
their
circumstances
and
country
and
to
look

upon

denationalisation
is
fought
against
in
every
possible
way
a
year
and
a
half
ago
work
among
women
was
begun
by
four
ladies
of
the
community
of
the
sisters
of
bethany
the
position
of
syrian
women
in
spite
of
its
partial
elevation
by
means
of
the
fiske
seminary
is
still
very
low
and
within
the
old
church
there
is
an
absolute
necessity
for
raising
it
and
through
it
the
tone
of
the
home
life
and
the
training
of
children
these
ladies
have
thirty
boarders
in
their
school
between
the
ages
of
eight
and
sixteen
a
previous
knowledge
of
reading
acquired
in
the
village
schools
being
a
condition
of
admission
the
daily
lessons
consist
of
bible
teaching
the
catechism
before
referred
to
ancient
and
modern
syriac
geography
arithmetic
and
all
branches
of
housework
and
due
regard
is
paid
to
syrian
customs
and
the
picturesque
syrian
costume
is
retained
since
these
ladies
have
acquired
an
elementary
knowledge
of
syriac
they
have
been
itinerating
in
the
urmi
villages
holding
bible
classes
giving
instruction
and
distributing
medicines
among
the
sick
the
ignorance
and
superstition
of
the
christian
women
are
almost
past
belief
one
great
difficulty
which
the
sisters
have
to
encounter
arises
from
the
early
marriages
of
the
girls
of
eleven
and
twelve
years
old
being
quite
common
it
may
reasonably
be
expected
that
the
presence
and
influence
the
gentleness
and
of
these
refined
and
cultured
christian
ladies
will
tell
most
favourably
upon
their
pupils
and
strengthen
with
every
month
of
their
residence
in
urmi
the
moslems
understand
and
respect
the
position
of
voluntarily
celibate
women
and
speak
of
them
as
those
who
have
left
the
world
the
mission
clergy
of
late
have
striven
to
instruct
the
adult
syrian
population
of
the
urmi
plain
by
preaching
among
them
systematically
explaining
in
a
very
elementary
manner
the
principles
of
christianity
and
their
application
to
the
life
of
man
they
have
also
set
up
a
printing
press
and
have
already
printed
in
syriac
type
a
number
of
school
books
the
catechism
the
of
the
the
most
venerable
of
the
syrian
liturgical
documents
the
and
the
ancient
and
modern
syriac
grammars
and
a
lectionary
it
is
the
earnest
hope
of
the
promoters
of
this
mission
that
if
this
ancient
oriental
church
once
the
first
mission
agency
in
the
world
can
be
reformed
and
enlightened
she
may
yet
be
the
means
of
evangelising
the
two
great
sects
of
moslems
by
means
of
missionaries
akin
to
them
in
customs
character
and
habits
of
thought
orientals
to
orientals
the
subject
of
christian
missions
in
persia
is
a
very
interesting
one
and
many
thoughtful
minds
are
asking
whether
christianity
is
likely
to
be
a
factor
in
the
future
of
the
empire
as
things
are
no
direct
efforts
to
convert
moslems
to
christianity
can
be
made
for
the
death
penalty
for
apostasy
is
not
legally
abolished
and
even
if
it
were
popular
fanaticism
would
vent
itself
upon
proselytes
it
must
be
recognised
that
the
christian
missionary
is
a
disturbing
element
in
persia
he
is
tolerated
not
welcomed
and
tolerated
only
while
his
efforts
to
detach
people
from
the
national
faith
are
futile
missions
have
been
in
operation
in
persia
for
more
than
fifty
years
and
probably
at
the
present
time
there
are
over
missionaries
at
work
in
the
country
if
the
value
of
their
work
were
to
be
judged
of
by
the
number
of
moslem
converts
they
have
made
it
must
be
pronounced
an
the
result
of
the
impossibility
of
making
any
direct
attack
upon
islam
is
that
these
excellent
men
and
women
are
at
present
ostensibly
engaged
in
the
attempt
to
purify
the
faith
and
practice
of
the
syrian
and
armenian
churches
to
enlighten
their
members
religiously
and
intellectually
and
to
christianise
the
jews
waiting
patiently
for
the
time
when
an
aggressive
movement
against
islam
may
be
possible
in
the
meantime
the
holy
scriptures
are
being
widely
disseminated
the
preacher
of
christianity
itinerates
among
the
villages
the
christian
religion
is
greatly
discussed
and
missionary
physicians
the
true
pioneers
of
the
faith
are
modifying
by
their
personal
influence
the
opposition
to
the
progress
of
the
missionaries
with
whom
they
are
associated
on
the
whole
and
in
spite
of
slow
progress
and
the
apparently
insurmountable
difficulties
presented
by
hostility
or
indifference
i
believe
that
christian
missions
in
persia
especially
by
their
educational
agencies
and
the
circulation
of
the
bible
are
producing
an
increasing
tending
towards
secular
as
well
as
religious
progress
and
are
gaining
an
influence
so
that
lamentably
slow
as
the
advance
of
christianity
is
its
prospects
can
not
justly
be
overlooked
in
considering
the
probable
future
of
persia
footnotes
the
name
of
the
town
and
lake
is
spelt
variously
urmi
urumi
urumiya
ourmia
and
oroomiah
the
moslems
call
it
urumi
and
the
christians
urmi
to
which
spelling
i
have
adhered
at
the
present
time
when
the
persecution
of
the
in
russia
is
attracting
considerable
attention
it
may
interest
my
readers
to
hear
that
one
of
the
earliest
promoters
of
the
movement
was
yacub
dilakoff
a
syrian
and
a
graduate
of
the
old
american
college
he
went
to
russia
thirty
years
ago
and
was
so
horrified
at
the
ignorance
and
gross
superstition
of
the
peasantry
that
he
studied
russian
in
the
hope
of
enlightening
them
and
to
aid
his
purpose
became
an
itinerant
hawker
of
bibles
the
common
people
heard
him
gladly
and
among
both
the
orthodox
and
the
lutherans
prayer
unions
were
formed
from
which
those
who
frequented
them
received
the
name
by
which
they
are
known
from
hour
dilakoff
whom
the
love
to
call
our
bishop
has
been
thrown
into
prison
several
times
but
on
his
liberation
began
to
teach
among
the
sect
of
the
in
the
crimea
and
on
the
volga
with
such
success
that
sixteen
congregations
have
been
formed
among
them
his
zeal
has
since
carried
him
to
the
colonies
on
the
amoor
where
he
has
been
preaching
and
teaching
for
three
years
with
such
remarkable
results
as
to
have
received
the
title
of
a
modern
apostle
in
years
after
its
establishment
a
conference
of
bishops
presbyters
and
deacons
all
of
whom
had
received
ordination
in
the
old
church
with
preachers
elders
and
missionaries
met
and
deliberated
this
conference
adopted
its
own
confession
form
of
government
and
discipline
at
first
very
simple
some
things
were
taken
from
the
canons
and
rituals
of
the
old
church
others
from
the
usages
of
protestant
churches
the
traditions
of
the
old
church
were
respected
to
some
extent
for
example
no
influence
has
induced
the
native
brethren
to
remit
the
diaconate
to
a
mere
service
in
temporalities
the
deacons
are
a
preaching
order
of
the
subsequent
history
of
this
church
the
same
authority
writes
as
follows
the
missionaries
in
were
welcomed
by
the
ecclesiastics
and
people
and
for
many
years
an
honest
effort
was
made
to
reform
the
old
body
the
syrian
church
without
destroying
its
organisation
this
effort
failed
and
a
new
church
was
gradually
formed
for
the
following
reasons
the
patriarch
did
all
in
his
power
to
destroy
the
evangelical
work
he
threatened
beat
and
imprisoned
the
teachers
and
converts
and
made
them
leave
his
fold
of
the
converts
could
no
longer
accept
unscriptural
practices
and
rank
abuses
that
prevailed
and
it
became
evident
that
there
was
no
method
to
reform
them
at
every
effort
the
rent
was
made
worse
of
the
converts
asked
for
better
care
and
purer
and
better
teaching
and
means
of
grace
than
they
found
in
the
dead
language
rituals
and
ordinances
of
the
old
church
the
missionaries
were
slow
in
abandoning
the
hope
that
the
nestorian
church
would
become
reformed
and
purified
but
their
hope
was
in
vain
their
efforts
therefore
have
been
not
to
proselytise
but
to
leaven
the
whole
people
with
christian
truth
the
separation
was
made
in
no
spirit
of
hostility
or
controversy
there
was
no
violent
disruption
the
missionaries
have
never
published
a
word
against
the
old
church
ecclesiastics
or
its
polity
the
ordination
of
the
old
church
has
always
been
accepted
as
valid
the
missionaries
and
the
evangelical
bishops
have
sometimes
joined
in
the
ordination
services
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
draw
the
line
when
the
episcopal
ordination
ceased
and
the
presbyterian
began
in
the
reformed
body
the
relation
of
the
presbyterian
mission
work
to
the
old
ecclesiastics
is
thus
something
different
from
that
found
among
any
other
eastern
christians
the
patriarch
in
office
fifty
years
ago
was
at
first
very
friendly
to
the
missionaries
and
personally
aided
in
superintending
the
building
of
mission
houses
subsequently
he
did
all
in
his
power
to
break
up
the
mission
the
patriarch
now
in
office
has
taken
the
attitude
of
neutrality
with
frequent
indications
of
fairness
and
friendliness
toward
our
work
the
next
in
ecclesiastical
rank
is
the
mattran
syriac
for
metropolitan
the
only
one
left
of
the
metropolitans
named
in
the
thirteenth
century
the
present
incumbent
recently
made
distinct
overtures
to
our
evangelical
church
to
come
to
an
understanding
by
establishing
the
scriptural
basis
of
things
essential
and
allowing
liberty
in
things
he
fails
perhaps
to
understand
all
the
scriptural
issues
between
us
but
he
has
a
sincere
desire
to
walk
uprightly
and
to
benefit
his
people
of
the
bishops
three
have
been
united
with
the
reform
and
died
in
the
evangelical
church
the
three
bishops
in
kurdistan
are
friendly
and
give
their
influence
in
favour
of
our
schools
a
large
majority
of
the
priests
or
presbyters
of
the
old
church
in
persia
at
least
joined
the
reform
movement
and
as
large
a
proportion
of
the
deacons
in
all
nearly
seventy
of
the
priests
have
laboured
with
the
mission
as
teachers
preachers
or
pastors
and
more
than
half
of
these
continue
and
are
members
of
our
synod
in
some
places
the
reform
has
gathered
nearly
all
the
population
within
its
influence
in
many
places
it
is
not
unusual
to
find
half
the
population
in
our
winter
services
on
the
other
hand
there
are
many
places
where
the
ecclesiastics
are
immoral
and
opposed
and
ignorance
and
vice
abound
and
the
reform
moves
very
slowly
by
god
help
to
raise
up
and
restore
a
fallen
eastern
church
to
take
her
place
again
amongst
the
churches
of
christendom
to
infuse
spiritual
life
into
a
church
which
the
oppression
of
centuries
has
reduced
to
a
state
of
weakness
and
ignorance
to
give
the
chaldæan
or
assyrian
christians
a
religious
education
on
the
broad
principles
of
the
holy
catholic
and
apostolic
church
a
secular
education
calculated
to
fit
them
for
their
state
of
life
the
common
mistakes
and
dangers
of
and
of
europeanising
education
being
most
carefully
guarded
against
to
train
up
the
native
clergy
by
means
of
schools
and
seminaries
to
be
worthy
to
serve
before
god
in
their
high
vocation
and
to
rise
to
their
responsibilities
as
leaders
and
teachers
of
the
people
in
their
villages
to
build
schools
of
which
at
present
there
are
none
owing
to
the
extreme
poverty
and
misery
of
the
people
to
aid
the
patriarch
and
bishops
by
counsel
by
encouragement
and
by
active
support
to
reorganise
the
chaldæan
church
upon
her
ancient
lines
to
set
in
motion
the
ecclesiastical
machinery
now
rusty
through
disuse
and
to
revive
religious
discipline
amongst
clergy
and
laity
to
print
the
ancient
chaldæan
they
are
now
only
in
and
the
number
of
copies
is
totally
insufficient
for
the
supply
of
the
parish
churches
as
a
lesson
means
reading
portions
of
holy
scripture
and
translating
them
into
modern
syriac
the
absolute
fact
however
is
that
christian
nations
have
not
shown
any
zeal
in
communicating
the
blessings
of
christianity
to
persia
and
southern
turkey
england
has
sent
two

propagandism
on

so
contemptible

as
a

an
injury
to

a
soil
of
exceeding
richness
and
acres
of
dazzling
salt
it
has
very
few
boats
and
none
suited
for
passenger
traffic
its
waters
are
so
salt
that
fish
can
not
live
in
them
the
antiquarian
interests
of
urmi
consist
in
the
syrian
church
of
said
to
have
been
built
by
the
magi
on
their
return
from
bethlehem
a
tower
and
mosque
of
arab
architecture
seven
centuries
old
and
some
great
mounds
outside
the
walls
from
sixty
to
one
hundred
feet
in
height
composed
entirely
of
ashes
marking
the
site
of
the
altars
at
which
the
rites
of
one
of
the
purest
of
the
ancient
faiths
were
celebrated
as
the
birthplace
of
zoroaster
and
for
several
subsequent
ages
the
sacred
city
of
the
fire
worshippers
and
the
scene
of
the
restoration
of
the
mithraic
rites
urmi
must
always
remain
interesting
the
christian
population
of
the
city
is
not
very
large
though
it
is
estimated
that
there
are
syrian
christians
in
the
villages
of
the
plain
the
city
syrians
are
mostly
people
who
have
come
into
urmi
to
practise
trades
the
best
carpenters
as
well
as
the
best
photographers
and
tailors
are
syrians
and
though
in
times
past
the
moslems
refused
to
buy
from
the
christians
on
the
ground
that
things
made
by
them
are
unclean
the
prejudice
is
passing
away
there
is
a
called
the
whose
duty
it
is
to
deal
with
the
christians
the
office
seems
to
have
been
instituted
for
their
protection
at
the
instigation
of
the
british
government
but
the
europeans
regard
it
simply
as
a
means
of
oppression
and
extortion
and
desire
its
abolition
canon
maclean
goes
so
far
as
to
say
the
multiplication
of
judges
in
persia
means
the
multiplication
of
injustice
and
of
the
number
of
persons
who
can
extort
money
from
the
unfortunate
people
the
depends
chiefly
for
his
living
and
for
keeping
up
a
staff
of
servants
on
what
he
can
get
out
of
the
christians
in
the
way
of
fines
and
bribes
and
consequently
he
foments
quarrels
and
encourages
needless
litigation
on
all
hands
the
syrians
being
by
all
accounts
one
of
the
most
litigious
of
peoples
i
write
of
the
christians
of
urmi
and
its
plain
as
syrians
because
that
is
the
name
by
which
they
call
themselves
we
know
them
at
home
as
but
this
is
a
nickname
given
to
them
by
outsiders
and
i
know
of
no
reason
why
we
should
use
a
nomenclature
which
attaches
to
a
nation
the
stigma
of
an
ancient
heresy
they
are
sometimes
called
chaldæans
and
the
present
archbishop
of
canterbury
has
brought
into
currency
the
term
assyrians
which
however
is
never
used
by
themselves
or
by
any
orientals
in
speaking
of
them
the
moslems
apply
the
name
nasara
nazarenes
solely
to
the
syrian
christians
they
claim
that
christianity
was
introduced
among
them
by
the
magi
on
their
return
from
bethlehem
the
highest
estimate
of
their
numbers
is
and
of
these
more
than
are
in
turkey
the
persian
syrians
inhabit
the
flat
country
chiefly
the
plains
of
urmi
and
salmas
where
the
fertile
lands
are
most
carefully
cultivated
by
their
industry
in
my
last
letter
i
remarked
upon
the
prosperity
and
appearance
of
the
urmi
plain
its
syrian
inhabitants
usually
live
in
separate
villages
from
the
kurds
persians
and
armenians
and
are
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
moslems
of
the
shiah
sect
the
landlords
or
aghas
of
their
villages
are
generally
moslems
who
govern
their
tenants
in
something
of
feudal
style
land
is
a
favourite
investment
in
persia
and
owing
to
the
industrious
habits
of
the
syrians
the
of
their
villages
commands
a
high
price
the
aghas
often
oppress
the
peasants
but
the
tenure
of
houses
is
fairly
secure
and
according
to
canon
maclean
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
my
information
a
system
much
like
the
scotch
feuing
system
though
without
feu
charters
is
in
force
if
a
man
wishes
to
build
a
house
he
takes
a
present
of
a
few
or
a
few
with
him
and
applies
to
an
agha
for
a
site
after
it
is
granted
he
pays
an
annual
ground
rent
of
but
he
can
build
his
house
as
he
pleases
and
it
can
not
be
taken
from
him
so
long
as
he
pays
his
ground
rent
moreover
he
can
sell
the
house
and
give
a
to
the
purchaser
with
the
sole
restriction
that
the
new
possessor
must
become
a
vassal
of
the
agha
in
addition
to
the
payment
of
the
ground
rent
the
tenant
is
taxed
annually
by
the
agha
for
every
female
buffalo
for
every
cow
and
for
every
ewe
and
after
they
have
begun
to
bear
young
the
agha
also
receives
from
each
householder
annually
two
fowls
a
load
of
some
eggs
three
days
labour
or
the
price
of
it
and
a
fee
on
every
occasion
of
a
marriage
each
house
pays
also
a
tax
of
a
year
and
gives
a
present
of
firewood
to
the
of
urmi
the
mussulman
governor
of
the
christians
in
his
turn
the
agha
pays
to
the
shah
from
a
third
to
a
half
of
the
total
taxation
a
even
when
built
of
bricks
rarely
costs
more
than
and
often
not
the
half
of
that
sum
the
great
feature
of
a
syrian
dwelling
is
what
is
called
emphatically
the
house
the
combined
bedroom
kitchen
bakery
and
workroom
of
one
or
more
families
this
room
can
not
possess
a
as
its
openings
for
light
and
air
are
in
the
roof
a
stable
and
granary
are
attached
to
it
vineyards
are
the
chief
reliance
of
the
syrians
of
the
urmi
plain
their
produce
whether
as
grapes
raisins
or
wine
being
always
marketable
they
are
held
on
the
same
tenure
as
the
houses
and
as
long
as
the
remain
in
the
ground
and
the
ground
rent
which
is
a
year
for
the
a
piece
of
ground
yards
square
is
paid
the
tenant
can
not
be
evicted
where
vineyards
are
for
a
year
a
fair
rent
is
from
to
a
if
a
tenant
buys
a
property
from
an
agha
the
yearly
taxation
is
a
grass
fields
and
orchards
are
held
on
the
same
tenure
as
vineyards
and
at
the
same
rent
with
ploughed
land
the
case
is
different
if
the
tenant
provides
the
seed
he
gives
the
agha
a
third
of
the
produce
and
if
the
agha
provides
seed
the
tenant
returns
the
tenant
of
ploughed
land
may
be
changed
annually
this
paying
the
rent
in
kind
is
going
on
just
now
in
every
village
and
the
aghas
secure
themselves
against
dishonesty
by
requiring
that
the
grain
shall
be
threshed
on
their
floors
in
addition
their
servants
watch
night
and
day
by
turns
in
an
erection
similar
to
the
lodge
in
a
garden
of
cucumbers
or
melons
an
arbour
of
boughs
perched
at
a
height
of
seven
or
eight
feet
upon
four
poles
the
landlord
appears
at
intervals
to
take
away
his
master
share
of
the
grain
it
is
all
delightfully
primitive
the
arrangements
sound
equitable
the
taxes
are
moderate
and
in
some
respects
the
christians
are
not
more
victimised
by
their
landlords
than
are
their
mohammedan
neighbours
the
people
acknowledge
readily
that
as
regards
oppression
they
are
much
better
off
than
they
were
and
that
in
this
respect
the
presence
of
the
american
missionaries
in
urmi
has
been
of
the
greatest
advantage
to
them
for
these
gentlemen
never
fail
to
represent
any
gross
case
of
oppression
can
be
thoroughly
to
the
governor
of
urmi
or
in
the
last
resort
to
the
governor
of
azerbijan
the
oppressions
exercised
by
the
aghas
consist
in
taking
extra
taxes
demanding
labour
without
wages
and
carrying
off
christian
girls
for
their
the
laws
which
affect
christians
specially
and
injuriously
are
that
the
evidence
of
a
christian
is
not
received
against
a
mussulman
that
if
any
member
of
a
christian
family
becomes
a
moslem
he
or
she
becomes
entitled
to
claim
the
whole
property
of
the
house
which
as
often
as
not
consists
of
two
or
three
families
the
apostatising
member
of
a
household
is
usually
a
girl
who
either
falls
in
love
with
or
is
carried
off
by
a
young
mohammedan
who
declares
truly
or
falsely
that
she
has
embraced
his
creed
a
good
governor
is
careful
in
these
matters
and
in
some
cases
gives
the
girl
only
her
share
of
the
family
property
but
a
bad
governor
may
at
any
time
carry
out
the
law
or
use
it
as
a
means
for
extorting
ruinous
bribes
every
christian
man
above
the
age
of
sixteen
pays
a
poll
tax
of
annually
for
exemption
from
military
service
but
from
this
impost
the
headman
of
a
village
who
is
at
once
its
and
its
spokesman
is
free
he
ranks
next
to
the
priest
and
is
treated
by
the
villagers
with
considerable
respect
i
have
found
the
syrian
as
polite
and
obliging
as
the
persian
although
the
persian
government
has
been
tolerably
successful
in
subduing
the
kurds
within
its
territory
the
christians
of
the
slopes
of
the
urmi
plain
are
exposed
to
great
losses
of
sheep
and
cattle
from
kurdish
mountaineers
who
it
is
said
cross
the
turkish
frontier
and
return
into
turkey
with
their
booty
the
american
and
english
missionaries
do
not
paint
the
syrians
de
though
the
former
during
their
long
residence
in
the
country
must
have
lifted
up
several
hundreds
to
the
blessings
of
a
higher
life
and
these
in
rising
themselves
must
have
exercised
an
unconscious
influence
on
their
brethren
since
i
came
i
have
seen
several
women
whose
tone
would
bear
comparison
with
that
of
the
best
among
ourselves
and
who
owe
it
gratefully
to
the
training
and
influence
of
the
fiske
seminary
i
like
the
women
much
better
than
the
men
the
christians
complain
terribly
of
the
way
in
which
justice
is
administered
and
doubtless
nothing
can
be
worse
but
the
europeans
say
that
the
people
bring
much
of
its
hardship
upon
themselves
by
their
frightful
litigiousness
and
their
habit
of
going
to
law
about
the
veriest
trifles
intense
avarice
seems
to
be
a
characteristic
of
the
syrians
of
the
persian
plains
and
they
fully
share
with
other
orientals
in
the
failings
of
untruthfulness
and
untrustworthiness
they
are
said
to
be
very
drunken
as
well
as
grossly
ignorant
and
superstitious
and
the
abuses
and
unutterable
degradation
of
their
church
perpetuate
all
that
is
bad
in
the
national
character
the
women
are
spoken
of
as
chaste
and
some
of
the
worst
forms
of
vice
are
happily
unknown
among
the
syrians
though
they
are
practised
by
the
moslems
around
them
their
hospitality
their
sufferings
for
the
faith
and
their
family
attachment
are
justly
to
be
reckoned
among
their
virtues
but
on
the
whole
i
think
that
the
extraordinary
interest
attaching
to
them
and
which
i
feel
very
strongly
myself
is
due
rather
to
their
past
than
to
their
present
on
this
plain
the
dress
of
the
men
is
much
assimilated
to
that
of
the
persians
but
the
women
wear
their
national
costume
the
is
a
coloured
shirt
over
which
is
worn
a
sleeved
waistcoat
of
a
different
colour
and
above
this
is
an
coat
reaching
to
the
knees
loose
trousers
so
full
as
to
look
like
a
petticoat
are
worn
and
frequently
an
apron
and
a
heavy
silver
belt
are
added
the
is
very
becoming
and
consists
of
a
raised
cap
of
cloth
or
silk
embroidered
or
jewelled
with
a
white
muslin
veil
over
it
and
the
head
but
the
face
is
exposed
except
in
the
case
of
married
women
who
draw
a
part
of
the
veil
over
the
mouth
it
is
not
proper
that
the
hair
should
be
seen
there
is
something
strikingly
biblical
about
their
customs
and
speech
at
dinner
at
i
noticed
that
it
is
a
mark
of
friendship
for
a
man
to
dip
a
piece
of
bread
a
sop
into
the
soup
and
give
it
to
another
a
touching
reminiscence
a
priest
is
greeted
with
hail
master
a
teacher
is
addressed
as
rabban
the
salutation
is
peace
be
with
you
and
such
words
as
and
occasionally
startle
the
ear
in
the
midst
of
unintelligible
speech
suggesting
that
the
aramaic
of
our
lord
day
was
very
near
akin
to
the
old
syriac
of
which
the
present
vernacular
is
a
development
as
among
the
moslems
pious
phrases
are
common
a
syrian
receiving
a
kindness
often
replies
may
god
give
you
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
when
a
man
makes
a
purchase
or
enters
on
a
new
house
or
puts
on
a
new
garment
it
is
customary
to
say
to
him
may
god
bless
your
house
your
garment
etc
a
child
learning
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
is
taught
to
say
at
the
close
glory
to
christ
our
king
a
copyist
begins
his
manuscript
by
writing
within
an
ornamental
margin
in
the
strength
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
we
begin
to
write
and
a
man
entering
on
a
piece
of
work
honours
the
apostolic
command
by
saying
if
the
lord
will
i
shall
accomplish
it
my
friends
tell
me
that
i
shall
find
the
syrians
of
the
mountains
a
different
people
and
a
mountaineer
is
readily
recognised
in
the
streets
by
the
beauty
and
picturesqueness
of
his
dress
the
eight
days
in
urmi
have
been
a
very
pleasant
whirl
a
continual
going
to
and
fro
between
the
college
and
the
fiske
seminary
the
english
clergy
house
and
the
sisters
house
receiving
syrian
visitors
at
home
and
holding
a
reception
for
them
in
the
city
calling
on
the
governor
visiting
the
english
upper
school
where
deacons
in
the
beautiful
syrian
costume
with
daggers
in
their
girdles
look
more
like
bandits
than
theological
students
and
spending
a
day
at
where
i
saw
shamasha
khananeshoo
deacon
abraham
orphanage
dined
with
him
and
his
charming
wife
and
a
number
of
other
syrians
in
syrian
style
and
went
to
the
crowded
church
where
the
part
of
the
floor
occupied
by
the
women
looked
like
a
brilliant
here
in
the
middle
of
the
service
the
or
priest
said
that
the
people
especially
the
women
were
very
anxious
to
know
for
what
reason
i
was
travelling
to
which
evidence
of
an
enlightened
curiosity
i
returned
a
reply
through
an
interpreter
and
reminded
them
of
the
glories
of
their
historic
church
and
its
missionary
fervour
possesses
one
of
the
largest
of
the
zoroastrian
mounds
of
ashes
it
is
a
pity
that
these
are
not
protected
and
that
the
villagers
are
allowed
to
carry
away
the
soil
for
manure
and
to
break
up
the
walls
and
cells
which
are
imbedded
in
them
for
building
materials
this
vandalism
has
brought
to
notice
various
curious
relics
such
as
earthenware
vessels
of
small
size
and
unique
shape
and
a
stone
tomb
containing
a
human
skeleton
with
several
copper
spikes
from
four
to
five
inches
long
driven
into
its
skull
in
another
mound
at
some
distance
from
this
one
a
large
earthen
sarcophagus
was
discovered
also
containing
a
skeleton
with
long
nails
driven
into
its
skull
deacon

work

it

economically
managed

in
the
simple

of

it
is
satisfactory
to
know
that
the

are
carefully
audited
by

flown
by

successful

route
that
i
wish
to
take
and
two
sets
of
kurds
after
making
agreements
to
carry
my
loads
have
disappeared
various
syrians
have
come
down
from
the
mountains
with
stories
of
kurdish
raids
on
their
sheep
and
cattle
but
as
such
things
are
always
going
on
and
the
impression
that
things
are
much
worse
than
usual
does
not
rest
on
any
ascertained
basis
my
friends
do
not
advise
me
to
give
up
the
journey
to
kochanes
and
i
am
just
starting
for
trebizond
footnotes
a
name
usually
applied
to
the
roman
uniats
at
mosul
the
mode
of
building
mud
houses
was
described
in
letter
vi
vol
labaree
whose
experience
stretches
back
for
thirty
years
writes
of
the
races
under
persian
rule
in
the
province
of
azerbijan
in
the
following
terms
the
nestorians
and
armenians
of
persia
in
common
with
their
mohammedan
neighbours
suffer
from
the
evil
forms
of
society
and
government
which
have
been
bequeathed
to
them
from
the
earliest
dawnings
of
history
landlordism
in
its
worst
forms
bears
sway
the
poor
or
tenant
must
pay
his
landlord
or
of
all
the
produce
of
his
farm
aside
from
his
poll
tax
he
must
pay
a
tax
on
his
house
his
hayfields
and
his
fruit
trees
and
on
all
his
stock
with
the
exception
of
the
oxen
with
which
he
tills
the
soil
but
this
is
not
all
he
is
virtually
at
the
mercy
of
his
agha
which
translated
literally
means
master
a
word
which
most
correctly
describes
the
relation
of
the
landlord
to
his
peasants
by
law
he
may
require
from
each
of
his
three
days
of
labour
without
pay
in
reality
he
makes
them
work
for
him
as
much
as
he
sees
fit
he
helps
himself
to
what
he
pleases
whenever
he
makes
them
a
visit
he
sells
them
grain
and
flour
above
the
market
price
he
ties
them
up
and
beats
them
for
slight
offences
and
to
all
this
and
much
else
must
the
poor
peasant
submit
for
fear
of
worse
persecutions
if
he
complains
in
these
respects
moslem
christian
and
jew
suffer
alike
later
i
heard
the
same
accusation
brought
against
the
persian
kurds
by
a
high
official
in
constantinople
the
national
customs
of
the
syrians
are
endless
and
in
many
ways
very
interesting
they
are
treated
very
fully
in
a
scarce
volume
called
in
persia
among
the
by
justin
perkins
farewell
impressions
of
persia
in
the
letters
by
which
this
chapter
is
preceded
few
general
opinions
have
been
expressed
on
persia
its
government
and
its
people
but
now
that
i
contemplate
them
with
some
regard
to
perspective
and
have
reversed
some
of
my
earlier
and
hastier
judgments
i
will
with
the
reader
permission
give
some
of
the
impressions
formed
during
a
journey
extending
over
nine
months
chiefly
in
the
western
and
portions
of
the
empire
on
the
pillared
plain
of
persepolis
on
the
portals
which
tower
above
the
hall
of
xerxes
the
palace
of
darius
and
the
stairways
with
the
sculptured
which
portray
the
magnificence
the
military
triumphs
and
the
religious
ceremonial
of
the
greatest
of
the
persian
monarchs
runs
the
stately
inscription
i
am
xerxes
the
king
the
great
king
the
king
of
kings
the
king
of
the
countries
the
upholder
of
the
great
world
the
son
of
darius
the
king
the
achæmenian
and
on
the
tablets
on
the
rock
of
besitun
is
inscribed
in
language
as
august
the
claim
of
darius
the
mede
to
a
dominion
which
in
his
day
was
regarded
as
nearly
universal
the
centuries
which
have
passed
since
these
claims
were
made
have
seen
the
ruin
of
the
of
persepolis
the
triumph
of
islam
over
zoroastrianism
the
devastating
sweep
of
the
hordes
of
taimurlane
and
other
conquerors
the
destruction
of
ancient
art
and
frontiers
and
the
compression
of
the
empire
within
comparatively
narrow
limits
still
these
limits
include
an
area
about
thrice
the
size
of
france
the
sovereign
has
reassumed
the
title
of
king
of
kings
persia
takes
her
own
place
and
that
not
a
low
one
in
the
comity
of
nations
and
the
genuine
persians
retain
vitality
enough
to
compel
the
allegiance
of
the
numerically
important
tribes
included
within
their
frontiers
though
scarcely
more
than
soldiers
are
with
the
colours
at
any
given
time
still
under
a
land
system
fourteen
centuries
old
persia
produces
cereals
enough
for
home
consumption
with
a
surplus
for
export
her
peasants
are
thrifty
and
industrious
and
their
methods
of
tillage
though
among
the
most
ancient
on
earth
are
well
adapted
to
their
present
needs
and
the
conditions
of
soil
and
climate
her
merchants
are
able
and
enterprising
and
her
sagacious
liberality
in
the
toleration
of
christians
and
jews
has
added
strength
to
her
commercial
position
though
she
has
lost
the
high
order
of
civilisation
which
she
possessed
centuries
before
christ
she
has
in
no
sense
relapsed
into
barbarism
and
on
the
whole
good
order
and
security
prevail
the
condition
of
modern
persia
has
to
be
studied
along
with
that
of
the
configuration
of
the
country
the
traveller
through
khorasan
and
seistan
from
the
gulf
to
yezd
or
from
bushire
to
tihran
views
it
as
a
region
a
desert
with
an
occasional
oasis
and
legitimately
describes
it
as
such
the
traveller
through
the
bakhtiari
mountains
and
from
burujird
through
western
persia
up
to
the
sea
of
urmi
seeing
the
superb
pasturages
and
perennial
streams
of
the
the
and
the
and
the
vast
area
of
careful
cultivation
sprinkled
with
towns
and
villages
which
extends
from
a
few
miles
north
of
burujird
to
the
walls
of
urmi
and
far
beyond
may
with
equal
fidelity
describe
it
as
a
land
of
abounding
waters
a
peopled
and
garden
the
direction
of
my
journey
has
been
fully
indicated
it
is
only
from
the
descriptions
of
others
that
i
know
anything
of
the
arid
wastes
of
eastern
persia
or
of
the
moist
and
malarious
provinces
bordering
on
the
caspian
sea
with
their
alluvial
valleys
and
rice
grounds
and
their
jungle
and
mountains
or
of
the
verdureless
plains
and
steppes
of
kerman
and
laristan
persia
proper
the
country
which
has
supplied
the
race
which
has
evinced
such
a
remarkable
vitality
and
historic
continuity
may
be
described
as
a
vast
plateau
from
to
feet
in
altitude
extending
on
the
east
into
afghanistan
on
the
into
armenia
and
overlooking
the
caspian
to
the
north
and
the
persian
gulf
and
the
vast
levels
of
mesopotamia
to
the
south
and
to
reach
this
platform
from
the
south
lofty
ranges
which
include
the
of
shiraz
must
be
crossed
from
the
tigris
valley
on
the
west
it
is
only
accessible
by
surmounting
the
zagros
chain
and
lesser
ranges
and
to
attain
it
from
the
north
the
traveller
must
climb
the
rocky
pathways
of
the
elburz
mountains
this
great
iranian
plateau
except
in
eastern
persia
is
intersected
both
by
mountain
ranges
and
detached
mountain
masses
which
store
up
in
their
sunless
hollows
the
snowfall
on
which
all
persian
agriculture
depends
the
rainfall
being
so
scanty
as
to
be
of
little
practical
value
thus
the
possibility
of
obtaining
supplies
of
water
from
the
melting
snows
dictates
the
drift
of
population
and
it
seems
unlikely
that
the
plains
of
eastern
persia
where
no
such
supplies
exist
were
ever
more
populous
than
now
it
was
otherwise
with
parts
of
central
persia
now
lying
waste
for
the
remains
of
canals
and
attest
that
a
process
of
local
depopulation
has
been
going
on
it
is
the
configuration
of
the
country
rather
than
anything
else
which
accounts
for
the
unpeopled
wastes
in
some
directions
and
the
constant
succession
of
towns
and
populous
villages
in
others
of
the
population
thus
distributed
along
hill
slopes
and
on
the
plains
at
the
feet
of
the
ranges
there
is
no
accurate
record
and
the
total
has
been
variously
estimated
at
from
six
to
nine
millions
estimates
of
the
urban
and
village
populations
were
in
most
cases
supplied
to
me
by
the
persian
local
officials
but
from
these
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
necessary
to
make
a
very
liberal
deduction
general
schindler
a
gentleman
for
some
years
in
the
persian
government
service
who
has
travelled
over
a
great
part
of
persia
with
the
view
of
ascertaining
its
resources
and
condition
in
the
year
estimated
its
population
at
in
his
analysis
the
christian
and
the
bakhtiari
and
feili
lur
populations
are
according
to
present
information
greatly
if
i
may
venture
to
hazard
an
opinion
after
travelling
over
a
considerable
area
of
western
persia
it
would
be
that
the
higher
estimate
is
nearest
the
mark
for
the
natural
increase
in
time
of
peace
as
accepted
by
statists
is
per
cent
per
annum
and
persia
has
had
peace
and
freedom
from
famine
for
very
many
years
the
country
population
consists
of
or
permanent
cultivators
and
ilyats
or
nomadic
pastoral
tribes
and
lead
and
iron
may
hereafter
produce
commercial
centres
but
the
industry
of
persia
at
present
may
be
said
to
be
nearly
altogether
agricultural
the
settled
peasant
population
so
far
as
i
am
able
to
judge
is
well
fed
and
fairly
well
clothed
and
the
habitations
suit
the
climate
the
people
are
poor
but
not
with
the
poverty
of
europe
that
is
except
in
famine
years
there
is
no
scarcity
of
the
necessaries
of
life
with
the
single
exception
of
fuel
the
wages
of
the
agricultural
labourer
vary
from
a
day
with
food
to
without
a
skilled
mason
earns
a
carpenter
get
from
to
per
month
nominally
without
board
but
with
and
other
pickings
female
servants
much
less
prices
are
however
low
clothing
tea
coffee
and
sugar
cost
about
the
same
as
in
europe
the
cotton
worn
by
the
poor
is
very
cheap
wheat
which
is
sold
by
weight
costs
at
from
to
per
load
of
lbs
i
have
been
told
by
several
cultivators
that
a
man
can
live
and
bring
up
an
average
family
on
something
under
a
year
i
did
not
see
anything
like
grinding
poverty
in
the
villages
if
it
existed
the
old
and
helpless
could
scarcely
be
supported
by
their
relatives
and
the
women
in
spite
of
the
seclusion
of
custom
and
faith
would
be
compelled
to
work
in
the
fields
a
barbarism
which
i
never
saw
in
persia
among
moslems
in
both
town
and
country
the
working
classes
appeared
to
me
to
be
as
comfortable
and
on
the
whole
as
happy
as
people
in
the
same
condition
in
life
in
most
other
countries
with
the
exception
and
that
not
a
small
one
of
their
liability
to
official
exactions
the
peasants
are
grossly
ignorant
hardy
dirty
bigoted
domestic
industrious
avaricious
sober
and
tractable
and
ages
of
misrule
have
developed
in
them
many
of
the
faults
of
oppressed
oriental
peoples
of
the
country
outside
of
the
district
in
which
they
live
they
usually
know
nothing
they
detest
the
local
governors
but
to
the
shah
they
willingly
owe
and
are
ready
to
pay
a
right
loyal
allegiance
my
impression
of
the
persians
of
the
trading
and
agricultural
classes
is
that
they
are
thoroughly
unwarlike
fairly
satisfied
if
they
are
let
alone
unpatriotic
and
apparently
indifferent
to
the
prospect
of
a
russian
occupation
their
bearing
is
independent
rather
than
manly
their
religious
feelings
are
strong
and
easily
offended
their
sociability
and
love
of
fun
come
out
strongly
in
the
freedom
of
their
bazars
europeans
do
not
meet
with
anything
of
the
grovelling
deference
to
which
we
are
accustomed
in
india
if
there
be
obsequiousness
in
stereotyped
phraseology
there
is
none
in
manner
we
are
treated
courteously
as
strangers
but
are
made
to
feel
that
we
are
in
no
wise
essential
to
the
of
the
country
and
a
european
traveller
without
introductions
to
the
provincial
authorities
finds
himself
a
very
insignificant
person
indeed
governors
and
the
governed
are
one
they
understand
each
other
and
are
of
one
creed
and
there
is
no
ruling
alien
race
to
interfere
with
ancient
custom
or
freedom
of
action
or
to
wound
racial
susceptibilities
with
every
touch
even
the
traditional
infamies
of
administration
are
expected
and
understood
by
those
whom
they
chiefly
concern
the
rich
men
congregate
chiefly
in
the
cities
it
is
very
rare
to
find
any
but
the
poorer
khans
aghas
or
proprietors
of
villages
men
little
removed
from
the
peasants
around
them
living
on
their
own
properties
the
wealthy
the
lord
of
many
villages
resides
in
tihran
kirmanshah
or
isfahan
pays
a
who
manages
his
estate
and
fleeces
his
tenants
and
spends
his
revenues
himself
on
urban
pleasures
the
purchase
of
villages
and
their
surrounding
lands
is
a
favourite
investment
this
system
of
absenteeism
not
only
prevents
that
friendly
contact
between
landowner
and
peasant
which
is
such
a
desirable
feature
of
proprietorship
but
it
leaves
the
villages
exposed
to
the
exactions
of
the
and
without
a
semblance
of
protection
from
the
rapacious
demands
of
the
provincial
authorities
it
is
noteworthy
that
fortunes
made
in
trade
are
seeking
investment
in
land
the
upper
classes
in
persia
appear
to
me
to
differ
widely
from
orientals
as
they
are
supposed
to
be
and
often
really
are
they
love
life
intensely
fill
it
with
enjoyment
and
neither
regard
existence
as
a
task
to
be
toiled
through
nor
as
a
burden
to
be
got
rid
of
handsome
robust
restless
intelligent
imaginative
accumulative
vivacious
polished
in
manner
and
speech
many
of
them
excellent
linguists
well
acquainted
with
their
own
literature
especially
with
their
poets
lavish
alike
in
expenditure
on
personal
luxuries
and
in
charity
to
the
poor
full
of
artistic
instincts
and
loving
to
surround
themselves
with
the
beautiful
inquisitive
adaptable
addicted
to
sport
and
life
untruthful
both
from
hereditary
suspiciousness
and
excess
of
courtesy
the
persian
gentleman
has
an
individuality
of
his
own
which
is
more
nearly
akin
to
the
french
or
russian
than
to
the
oriental
type
my
impressions
of
the
morals
both
of
the
persian
peasantry
and
the
bakhtiari
lurs
are
as
to
some
points
rather
favourable
than
the
reverse
and
i
think
and
hope
that
there
is
as
much
domestic
affection
and
fidelity
as
is
compatible
with
a
religion
which
more
or
less
effectually
secures
the
degradation
of
woman
the
morals
of
the
upper
classes
are
i
believe
very
easy
in
various
carefully
written
papers
one
of
them
at
least
official
very
painful
glimpses
have
been
given
incidentally
into
the
state
of
persian
morality
and
undoubtedly
the
intrigues
of
the
are
as
unfavourable
to
purity
as
they
are
to
happiness
for
the
traveller
the
greater
part
of
persian
territory
is
absolutely
safe
i
have
ridden
on
horseback
through
it
at
every
season
of
the
year
in
some
regions
without
an
escort
in
others
with
persian
or
kurdish
guards
supplied
by
the
local
authorities
and
was
never
actually
the
victim
of
any
form
of
robbery
except
the
pilfering
from
an
unguarded
tent
though
travelling
with
only
an
indian
servant
i
found
the
provincial
authorities
everywhere
courteous
and
ready
to
aid
my
journey
by
every
means
within
their
power
though
in
persia
as
elsewhere
i
never
claimed
and
indeed
never
received
any
special
favour
on
the
ground
of
sex
a
few
darker
shadows
remain
to
be
put
in
there
is
no
education
truly
so
called
for
persians
except
in
tihran
and
under
the
existing
system
the
next
generation
is
not
likely
to
be
more
enlightened
than
the
present
all
the
towns
and
the
larger
villages
possess
mosque
schools
in
which
the
highest
education
bestowed
is
a
smattering
of
arabic
and
a
knowledge
of
the
tales
of
the
persian
characters
are
taught
and
some
attention
is
paid
to
caligraphy
for
a
man
who
can
write
well
is
sure
to
make
a
fair
living
the
reading
of
the
koran
in
arabic
is
the
of
the
teaching
very
few
of
the
boys
in
the
village
schools
learn
to
write
but
if
a
clever
lad
aspires
to
be
a
or
secretary
he
pays
great
attention
to
the
formation
of
the
persian
characters
and
acquires
that
knowledge
of
compliment
phrase
and
trope
which
is
essential
to
his
proposed
calling
pleading
waiting
and
the
elements
of
arithmetic
are
usual
among
the
bazar
class
and
merchants
but
with
the
rest
the
slight
knowledge
of
reading
acquired
in
childhood
is
soon
forgotten
and
the
ability
to
repeat
a
few
verses
from
the
koran
and
a
few
prayers
in
arabic
is
all
that
remains
of
the
mosque
school
education
school
discipline
is

the
rope

a

young
men
in
the
cities

are
destined
to
be
or
lawyers
proceed
to
the
or
colleges
where
they
acquire
a
thorough
knowledge
of

do
some
desultory
reading
and
hang
on
to
their
teachers
at
whose
feet
they
literally
sit
on
all
occasions
and
after
a
few
years
have
been
spent
in
rather
a
profitless
way
they
usually
find
employment
government
courtiers
the
higher
officers
in
the
army
diplomats
and
sons
of
wealthy
khans
receive
the
rudiments
of
a
liberal
education
in
the
college
at
tihran
where
they
frequently
acquire
a
very
creditable
knowledge
of

admirable

armenians

a

jews

outside
of

there
is
neither
intellectual
nor
moral
training
and
even
the
simplest
duties
of
life
such
as
honesty
truthfulness
and
regard
for
contract
are
never
inculcated
it
may
be
supposed
that
in
conformity
with
the
moslem
axiom
not
to
open
the
eyes
of
a
woman
too
wide
the
bulk
of
persian
women
are
not
thought
worthy
of
any
education
at
all
a
few
of
the
daughters
of
rich
men
can
read
the
koran
but
without
comprehending
it
and
can
both
read
and
recite
poetry
throughout
the
country
law
that
is
the
or
unwritten
law
a
mass
of
precedents
and
traditions
orally
handed
down
and
administered
by
secular
judges
is
not
held
in
any
respect
at
all
and
while
the
rich
can
override
it
by
bribery
the
poor
regard
it
only
as
a
commodity
which
is
bought
and
sold
and
which
they
are
too
poor
to
buy
the
other
department
of
persian
law
the
which
is
based
upon
the
koran
and
is
administered
by
religious
teachers
takes
cognisance
chiefly
of
civil
cases
and
its
administration
is
nearly
as
corrupt
as
that
of
the
law
in
the
sense
in
which
we
understand
it
as
the
avenger
of
wrong
and
the
sublimely
impartial
protector
of
individual
rights
and
liberties
has
no
existence
at
all
in
persia
the
curse
of
the
country
is
venal
it
meets
one
at
every
turn
and
in
protean
shapes
there
is
no
official
conscience
and
no
public
opinion
to
act
as
a
check
upon
official
unscrupulousness
of
government
as
an
institution
for
the
good
of
the
governed
there
is
no
conception
the
greed
which
is
among
the
most
painful
features
of
persian
character
finds
its
apotheosis
in
officialism
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
rounds
of
the
official
ladder
unblushing
bribery
is
the
of
promotion
it
is
very
obvious
that
the
shah
himself
is
the
government
he
is
an
absolute
despot
subject
to
no
controlling
influences
but
the
criticisms
of
the
european
press
and
the
demands
of
the
european
legations
he
is
the
sole
executive
his
ministers
are
but
servants
of
the
highest
grade
whose
duties
consist
in
carrying
out
his
orders
the
lives
and
properties
of
all
his
subjects
are
held
only
at
his
pleasure
his
sons
are
but
his
tools
to
be
raised
or
degraded
at
his
will
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
highest
personages
in
the
empire
the
shah
is
the
state
irresponsible
and
is
a
most
diligent
ruler
no
pleasures
not
even
the
chase
to
which
he
is
devoted
divert
his
attention
from
business
he
takes
the
initiative
in
all
policy
guides
with
a
firm
hand
the
destinies
of
persia
supervises
every
department
appoints
directly
to
all
offices
of
importance
and
by
means
known
to
absolute
rulers
has
his
eyes
in
every
part
of
his
dominions
he
is
regarded
as
a
very
able
man
his
european
travels
have
made
him
to
some
extent
an
enlightened
one
his
reign
of
years
has
been
disfigured
especially
in
its
earlier
portion
by
some
acts
which
we
should
regard
as
great
crimes
but
which
do
not
count
as
such
in
oriental
judgment
neither
are
the
sale
of
offices
the
taking
of
bribes
under
the
disguise
of
presents
the
receiving
of
what
is
practically
or
exactions
upon
rich
men
repugnant
in
the
slightest
degree
to
the
oriental
mind
remembering
the
unwholesome
traditions
of
his
throne
and
dynasty
we
must
give
him
full
credit
for
everything
in
which
he
makes
a
new
departure
surrounded
by
intrigue
hampered
by
the
unceasing
political
rivalry
between
england
and
russia
thwarted
by
the
obstructive
tactics
of
the
latter
at
every
turn
and
with
the
shadow
of
a
russian
occupation
of
the
northern
provinces
of
the
empire
looming
in
a
not
far
distant
future
any
step
in
the
direction
of
reform
taken
by
the
shah
involves
difficulties
of
which
the
outer
world
has
no
conception
not
only
in
braving
the
antagonism
of
his
powerful
neighbour
and
her
attempted
interference
with
the
internal
concerns
of
persia
but
in
overcoming
the
apathy
of
his
people
and
the
prejudices
of
his
as
it
is
under
him
persia
has
awakened
partially
from
her
long
sleep
the
state
of
insecurity
described
by
the
travellers
of
thirty
and
forty
years
ago
no
longer
exists
far
feebler
than
turkey
persia
through
the
resolute
will
of
one
man
has
eclipsed
turkey
altogether
in
suppressing
brigandage
in
subduing
the
kurds
and
other
nomadic
tribes
in
securing
safety
for
travellers
and
caravans
even
on
the
remoter
roads
and
in
producing
tolerable
contentment
among
the
armenian
and
nestorian
populations
under
him
the
authority
of
the
central
government
has
been
consolidated
the
empty
treasury
has
been
filled
the
of
the
provincial
governors
has
been
broken
persia
has
been
as
a
coherent
empire
certain
roads
have
been
made
posts
and
telegraphs
have
been
inaugurated
an
imperial
bank
with
branches
in
some
of
the
principal
towns
has
been
formed
foreign
capital
has
been
encouraged
or
at
least
permitted
to
enter
the
country
a
concession
for
the
free
navigation
of
the
karun
has
been
granted
and
the
company
the
most
hopeful
token
of
native
progress
has
received
imperial
favour
but
under
all
this
lies
the
inherent
rottenness
of
persian
administration
an
abyss
of
official
corruption
and
infamy
without
a
bottom
or
a
shore
a
corruption
of
heredity
and
tradition
unchecked
by
public
opinion
or
the
teachings
of
even
an
elementary
education
in
morals
and
the
rudiments
of
justice
there
are
few
men
pure
enough
to
judge
their
fellows
or
to
lift
clean
hands
to
heaven
and
power
and
place
are
valued
for
their
opportunities
for
plunder
in
no
part
of
persia
did
i
hear
any
complaint
of
the
tribute
levied
by
the
shah
it
is
regarded
as
legitimate
but
in
most
districts
allegations
concerning
the
rapacity
and
exactions
of
the
provincial
governors
were
universal
and
there
is
unfortunately
great
reason
for
believing
them
well
founded
the
farming
of
the
taxes
the
practical
purchase
of
appointments
the
gigantic
system
of
bribery
by
which
all
offices
are
obtained
the
absence
of
administrative
training
and
supervision
the
traditions
of
office
and
the
absolute
dependence
of
every
official
on
the
pleasure
of
a
sovereign
surrounded
by
the
intrigues
of
an
oriental
court
are
conditions
sufficient
to
destroy
the
virtue
of
all
but
the
best
of
men
where
all
appointments
are
obtained
practically
by
bribery
and
no
one
has
any
security
in
the
tenure
of
an
office
of
which
slander
bribery
or
intrigue
at
court
may
at
any
moment
deprive
him
it
is
natural
that
the
most
coveted
positions
should
be
those
in
which
the
largest
perquisites
can
be
made
and
that
their
occupants
should
feel
it
their
bounden
duty
to
make
hay
while
the
sun
shines
in
other
words
to
squeeze
the
people
so
long
as
there
is
anything
left
to
squeeze
the
great
drawback
of
the
persian
peasant
life
is
that
he
has
no
security
for
the
earnings
of
labour
he
is
the
ultimate
sponge
to
be
sucked
dry
by
all
above
him
every
official
squeezes
the
man
below
him
and
the
highest
is
squeezed
by
the
crown
little
if
any
of
the
revenue
drawn
from
the
country
is
spent
on
works
of
public
utility
and
roads
bridges
official
buildings
fortifications
and
all
else
are
allowed
to
fall
into
disrepair
in
downright
english
the
administration
of
government
and
law
is
execrable
and
there
can
be
little
hope
of
a
resurrection
for
persia
until
the
system
under
which
she
is
impoverished
be
reformed
or
swept
away
but
who
is
to
cleanse
this
augean
stable
who
will
introduce
the
elementary
principles
of
justice
are
tools
of
the
right
temper
to
work
with
to
be
found
among
the
men
of
this
generation
is
the
dwarfing
and
narrowing
creed
of
islam
to
be
replaced
or
in
any
way
to
be
modified
by
christianity
it
looks
very
much
as
if
the
men
to
initiate
and
carry
out
administrative
and
financial
reforms
are
not
forthcoming
and
that
unless
the
shah
is
willing
to
import
or
borrow
them
the
present
system
of
official
corruption
mendacity
bribery
and
obstruction
may
continue
to
prevail
the
inherent
weakness
of
persia
lies
in
her
administrative
system
rather
than
in
her
sparse
population
and
paucity
of
fuel
and
water
a
paucity
arising
partly
out
of
misgovernment
in
the
felt
evils
of
this
system
and
in
the
idea
that
law
equitable
taxation
and
security
for
the
earnings
of
labour
are
distinctively
european
blessings
lies
a
part
of
the
strength
of
russia
in
persia
i
have
elsewhere
remarked
upon
the
indifference
with
which
russian
annexation
is
contemplated
a
reformed
system
of
administration
by
giving
the
persian
people
something
to
live
for
and
die
for
would
doubtless
evoke
the
dormant
spirit
of
patriotism
and
render
foreign
conquest
or
acquisition
without
conquest
a
less
easy
task
after
living
for
ten
months
among
the
persian
people
and
fully
recognising
their
faults
i
should
regret
to
see
them
absorbed
by
the
white
czar
or
any
other
power
a
country
which
for
more
than
years
has
maintained
an
independent
existence
and
which
possesses
customs
a
language
a
civilisation
and
a
nationality
of
its
own
and
works
no
injury
to
its
neighbours
has
certainly
a
my
early
impressions
of
persia
were
of
effeteness
and
ruin
but
as
i
learned
to
know
more
of
the
vitality
energy
and
industry
of
her
people
and
of
the
capacities
of
her
prolific
soil
i
have
come
to
regard
her
resurrection
under
certain
circumstances
as
a
possibility
and
cordially
to
echo
the
wish
eloquently
expressed
by
the
marquis
of
salisbury
on
the
occasion
of
the
shah
last
visit
to
england
we
desire
above
all
things
that
persia
shall
not
only
be
prosperous
but
be
strong
strong
in
her
resources
strong
in
her
preparations
strong
in
her
alliances
in
order
that
she
may
pursue
the
peaceful
path
on
which
she
has
entered
in
security
and
tranquillity
footnotes
on
this
subject
there
can
be
no
better
authority
than
the
hon
george
curzon
who
after
careful
study
has
estimated
the
total
population
of
persia
at
over
nine
millions
in
caliphate
its
rise
decline
and
a
valuable
recent
work
its
author
sir
muir
dwells
very
strongly
on
the
narrowing
influence
of
islam
on
national
life
and
concludes
his
review
of
it
in
the
following
words
as
regards
the
spiritual
social
and
dogmatic
aspect
of
islam
there
has
been
neither
progress
nor
material
change
such
as
we
found
it
in
the
days
of
the
caliphate
such
is
it
also
at
the
present
day
christian
nations
may
advance
in
civilisation
freedom
and
morality
in
philosophy
science
and
the
arts
but
islam
stands
still
and
thus
stationary
so
far
as
the
lessons
of
its
history
avail
it
will
remain
in
a
chapter
at
the
end
of
his
book
he
deals
with
polygamy
servile
concubinage
temporary
marriages
and
the
law
of
divorce

of

kochanes
the
kurdish
turned
out
very
badly
they
came
at
twelve
instead
of
eight
compelling
me
to
do
only
a
march
then
they
brought
six
horses
instead
of
the
four
which
had
been
bargained
for
and
said
they
would
throw
down
the
loads
if
i
did
not
take
them
each
night
they
insisted
on
starting
the
next
morning
at
daybreak
but
no
persuasions
could
get
them
off
before
eight
they
said
they
could
not
travel
with
a
christian
except
in
broad
daylight
they
would
only
drive
a
mile
an
hour
and
instead
of
adhering
to
their
contract
to
bring
me
here
in
four
days
took
four
to
come
on
the
slightest
remonstrance
they
were
insolent
and
violent
and
threatened
to
throw
down
the
loads
in
the
most
inconvenient
places
and
they
eventually
became
so
mutinous
that
i
was
obliged
to
dismiss
them
at
the
halt
at
the
risk
of
not
getting
transport
any
farther
the
throw
on
the
road
from
urmi
was
a
very
large
one
and
consisted
of
nearly
all
the
english
and
american
mission
clergy
and
two
syrians
all
on
screaming
biting
kicking
horses
it
was
a
charming
ride
through
fruitful
country
among
pleasant
villages
to
anhar
the
wind
was
strong
and
bracing
clouds
were
drifting
grandly
over
the
splendid
mountains
to
the
west
the
ranges
to
the
north
were
glorified
by
rich
blue
colouring
purple
in
the
shadows
among
mountains
on
the
east
the
urmi
sea
showed
itself
as
a
turquoise
streak
and
among
gardens
and
vineyards
in
the
middle
distance
rose
zoroastrian
cones
of
ashes
and
the
great
mound
which
tradition
honours
as
the
scene
of
the
martyrdom
of
george
when
all
my
kind
friends
left
me
and
i
walked
alone
in
the
frosty
twilight
on
the
roof
of
my
comfortable
room
in
the
house
and
looked
towards
the
wall
of
the
frontier
mountains
through
which
my
journey
lay
i
felt
an
unwonted
feeling
of
elation
at
the
prospect
before
me
which
no
possible
perils
from
kurds
or
from
the
sudden
of
winter
could
damp
and
thus
far
the
interest
is
much
greater
even
than
i
expected
the
next
morning
i
was
joined
by
a
syrian
priest
a
man
of
great
learning
and
intelligence
a
turkish
subject
and
landed
proprietor
who
knows
everybody
in
this
region
and
speaks
english
well
he
is
fearfully
anxious
and
timid
partly
from
a
dread
of
being
robbed
of
his
splendid
saddle
mule
and
partly
from
having
the
responsibility
of
escorting
an
english
lady
on
a
journey
which
has
turned
out
full
of
peril
on
the
long
ascent
from
anhar
a
bitter
wintry
wind
prevailed
sweeping
over
the
tattered
thistles
and
the
pale
belated
campanulas
which
alone
remain
of
the
summer
flora
but
the
view
from
the
summit
was
one
of
rare
beauty
the
grandly
drifting
clouds
of
the
night
before
had
done
their
work
and
had
draped
the
kurdish
mountains
down
with
the
first
snows
of
winter
while
the
valley
at
their
feet
in
which
merwana
lies
was
a
smiling
autumn
scene
of
flowery
pasturage
and
busy
harvest
operations
under
the
magic
of
an
atmosphere
of

villages
is
in
the
intercession
of
cochrane
with
the
governor
of
azerbijan
as
i
reached
merwana
at
and
the
after
raging
for
an
hour
refused
to
proceed
i
took
mirza
and
bardah
the
priest
under
whose
hospitable
roof
i
lodged
with
me
and
went
up
the
valley
to
ombar
the
abode
of
hesso
with
the
vague
hope
of
doing
something
for
the
poor
people
the
path
lay
among
bright
streams
and
flowery
pastures
the
sun
was
warm
the
air
sharp
the
mountains
uplifted
their
sunlit
snows
into
a
heaven
of
delicious
blue
the
ride
was
charming
hesso
village
consisting
of
a
few
very
low
rough
stone
houses
overshadowed
by
great
cones
of
is
well
situated
on
a
slope
above
a
torrent
issuing
from
a
magnificent
cleft
in
the
mountain
wall
at
the
mouth
of
which
is
a
square
keep
on
a
rock
illustration
hesso
khan
hesso
house
is
just
a
but
and
a
ben
with
a
door
which
involves
stooping
its
rough
stone
walls
are
unplastered
and
the
only
light
admitted
comes
from
a
hole
in
the
roof
which
serves
to
let
out
the
smoke
i
confess
to
a
feeling
of
trepidation
when
i
asked
to
see
the
kurdish
chief
and
i
felt
the
folly
of
my
errand
a
kurd
took
us
into
a
room
dense
with
tobacco
smoke
which
from
its
darkness
the
roughness
of
its
walls
and
the
lowness
of
its
rude
roof
resembled
a
cave
rather
than
a
house
yet
hesso
receives
a
year
from
the
persian
government
and
has
apparently
unlimited
opportunities
for
plunder
there
were
some
coarse
mats
on
the
floor
and
a
with
some
russian
glass
two
persian
officials
and
a
number
of
and
kurds
with
jewelled
and
revolvers
in
their
girdles
and
rifles
by
their
sides
sat
or
reclined
against
the
wall
hesso
himself
leaned
against
a
roll
of
bedding
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
and
space
was
made
for
us
on
the
floor
at
his
left
hand
a
superb
stage
brigand
he
looked
in
fitting
surroundings
the
handsomest
man
i
have
seen
in
persia
a
large
man
with
a
large
face
dark
prominent
eyes
a
broad
brow
a
straight
nose
superb
teeth
a
fine
but
sensual
mouth
a
dark
olive
complexion
and
a
false
smile
a
jewelled
kurdish
turban
with
much
crimson
a
short
jacket
and
full
trousers
of
a
fine
woollen
fabric
an
embroidered
silk
shirt
socks
of
an
elaborate
pattern
a
girdle
of
many
yards
of
kashmir
stuff
with
eight
knots
one
above
another
in
the
middle
and
a
or
coat
of
honour
of
rich
kerman
brocade
formed
his
striking
costume
in
his
girdle
he
wore
a
with
an
ebony
hilt
and
scabbard
ornamented
with
filigree
gold
knobs
incrusted
with
turquoises
attached
to
the
girdle
by
a
silver
chain
two
yards
long
of
heavy
filigree
balls
a
beautiful
piece
of
work
hesso
brothers
superb
men
most
picturesquely
dressed
surrounded
him
the
kurds
who
handed
round
the
tea
and
the
jewelled
looked
fantastic
brigands
the
scene
was
a
picture
of
course
my
errand
failed
i
could
not
speak
about
the
sheep
through
the
priest
of
the
robbed
village
and
hesso
said
that
he
could
not
speak
on
any
political
subject
before
the
persians
who
were
present
the
conversation
was
not
animated
and
bardah
was
very
nervous
till
hesso
turned
round
and
with
an
awakened
expression
of
face
asked
how
it
was
that
england
had
allowed
turkey
to
grow
so
feeble
that
her
frontier
and
armenia
are
in
a
state
of
anarchy
hesso
handsome
face
is
that
of
a
villain
he
does
not
look
more
than
thirty
he
has
marksmen
at
his
disposal
the
father
of
this
redoubtable
kurdish
chief
died
in
prison
where
he
was
confined
by
order
of
the
shah
and
the
son
revenged
himself
by
harrying
this
part
of
the
shah
dominions
and
with
sixty
men
including
his
six
brothers
successfully
resisted
a
large
persian
force
sent
against
him
and
eventually
escaped
into
turkey
doing
much
damage
on
his
way
hesso
on
arriving
in
kerbela
obtained
a
letter
from
the
sheikh
or
chief
there
saying
that
he
offered
his
submission
to
the
shah
and
went
to
tihran
where
after
seeing
the
shah
splendour
he
said
that
if
he
had
known
it
before
he
would
not
have
been
in
rebellion
before
this
the
persians
took
a
strong
castle
from
the
kurds
and
garrisoned
it
with
an
officer
and
a
company
of
soldiers
up
to
it
one
day
went
hesso
boldly
keeping
the
six
men
who
went
with
him
out
of
sight
and
thumped
upon
the
gate
till
it
was
opened
saying
he
was
a
bearer
of
despatches
he
first
shot
the
sentry
dead
and
next
the
officer
who
came
to
see
what
the
disturbance
was
about
meantime
the
six
men
by
climbing
on
each
other
shoulders
scaled
the
castle
wall
and
by
confused
shouts
and
dragging
of
the
stone
roller
to
and
fro
over
the
roof
they
made
the
garrison
believe
that
it
was
attacked
by
a
large
force
and
it
surrendered
at
discretion
the
lives
of
the
soldiers
were
spared
but
they
were
marched
out
in
their
shirts
with
their
hands
above
their
heads
the
merwana
was
guarded
at
night
by
ten
men
the
following
morning
we
were
to
have
started
an
hour
before
daylight
but
the
refused
to
load
and
the
kurdish
with
his
horsemen
declined
to
start
till
an
hour
after
sunrise
because
he
could
not
earlier
tell
friends
from
foes
the
ground
was
covered
with
and
the
feathery
foliage
of
the
tamarisk
was
like
the
finest
white
coral
turning
into
the
mountains
we
spent
nine
hours
in
a
grand
defile
much
wooded
where
a
difficult
path
is
shut
in
with
the
marbishu
torrent
the
kurds
left
us
at
bani
when
two
fine
fellows
became
our
protectors
as
far
as
a
small
stream
crossing
which
we
entered
turkey
at
a
kurdish
village
over
which
one
might
ride
without
knowing
it
a
young
khan
emerged
from
one
of
the
burrows
and
said
he
would
give
us
guards
but
they
would
not
go
farther
than
a
certain
village
where
two
of
his
men
had
been
killed
three
days
before
there
is
blood
between
us
and
them
he
said
after
that
for
five
hours
up
to
marbishu
the
scenery
is
glorious
the
valley
narrows
into
a
picturesque
gorge
between
precipitous
mountains
from
to
feet
above
the
river
on
the
sides
of
which
a
narrow
and
occasionally
scaffolded
path
is
carried
not
always
passable
for
laden
mules
many
grand
ravines
came
down
upon
this
gorge
their
dwarf
trees
orange
tawny
and
mingled
with
leafage
the
rose
bushes
are
covered
with
masses
of
large
hips
the
bramble
trailers
are
crimson
and
gold
the
tamarisk
is
nature
like
the
dolphin
is
most
beautiful
in
dying
the
depths
were
filled
with
a
blue
gloom
the
peaks
which
tower
above
glittered
with
snow
the
air
was
fresh
and
intoxicating
it
was
the
romance
of
travel
but
it
soon
became
apparent
that
we
were
among
stern
and
even
perilous
realities
a
notorious
robber
chief
was
disposed
to
bar
our
passage
his
men
had
just
robbed
a
party
of
travellers
and
were
spread
over
the
hill
they
took
a
horse
from
johannes
but
afterwards
restored
it
on
certain
conditions
farther
on
we
met
a
number
of
kurds
with
thirty
fat
sheep
and
some
cattle
which
they
were
driving
off
from
marbishu
then
the
said
that
they
would
go
no
farther
than
the
village
for
they
heard
that
robbers
were
lying
in
wait
for
us
farther
on
in
the
wildest
part
of
the
gorge
where
two
ravines
meet
there
is
fine
stoneless
soil
tilled
like
a
garden
the
mountains
fall
a
little
apart
there
are
walnuts
fruit
trees
and
poplars
again
the
valley
narrows
the
path
just
hangs
on
the
hillside
and
i
was
riding
over
the
roofs
of
village
houses
for
some
time
before
i
knew
it
the
hills
again
opened
and
there
were
flourishing
breadths
of
turnips
and
people
digging
potatoes
an
article
of
food
and
export
which
was
introduced
by
the
missionaries
forty
years
ago
the
glen
narrowed
again
and
we
came
upon
the
principal
part
of
marbishu
rude
stone
houses
in
tiers
burrowing
deeply
into
the
hills
with
rock
above
and
rock
below
on
the
precipitous
sides
of
a
noisy
torrent
crossed
by
two
picturesque
log
bridges
one
of
the
wildest
situations
i
have
ever
seen
and
with
a
wintry
chill
about
it
for
the
sun
at
this
season
deserts
it
at
three
rude
primitive
colourless
its
dwellings
like
the
poorest
cowsheds
its
church
like
a
canadian
clinging
to
mountain
sides
and
spires
of
rock
so
long
as
i
remember
anything
i
shall
remember
marbishu
steep
narrow
paths
and
steep
rude
steps
brought
us
to
a
yard
with
a
rough
verandah
where
cooking
and
other
operations
were
going
on
and
at
the
entrance
we
were
cordially
welcomed
by
ishai
the
priest
after
ascertaining
that
it
would
be
very
dangerous
to
go
farther
i
crossed
the
river
to
the
church
which
is
one
of
the
finest
in
the
country
and
a
place
of
pilgrimage
the
village
is
noted
for
its
religious
faithfulness
the
church
is
said
to
be
years
old
a
low
windowless
stone
building
either
it
was
always
partially
subterranean
or
the
earth
has
accumulated
round
it
for
the
floor
is
three
feet
below
the
ground
outside
the
entrance
is
by
a
heavy
door
two
feet
six
inches
high
inside
it
is
as
nearly
dark
as
possible
two
or
three
circular
holes
at
a
great
height
in
the
enormously
thick
wall
let
in
as
many
glimmers
but
artificial
light
is
necessary
there
are
several
small
in
two
are
rude
and
ancient
tombs
of
ancient
bishops
plain
blocks
of
stone
with
crosses
upon
them
in
another
is
a
rough
desk
covered
with
candle
droppings
on
which
the
of
the
lay
open
and
on
it
a
cross
which
it
is
the
custom
to
kiss
a
fourth
is
used
for
the
safe
keeping
of
agricultural
implements
two
are
empty
and
one
of
these
serves
the
useful
purpose
of
a
mortuary
chapel
the
church
proper
is
very
small
and
high
the
stone
floor
has
been
worn
into
cavities
by
the
feet
of
worshippers
the
walls
where
not
covered
with
lengths
of
grimy
printed
cotton
are
black
with
the
candle
smoke
of
ages
the
one
sign
of
sacred
use
is
a
rude
stone
screen
at
the
east
end
at
openings
in
the
front
of
which
the
people
receive
the
eucharist
behind
this
is
the
sanctuary
into
which
the
priest
alone
and
he
fasting
may
enter
old
brass
lamps
and
candelabra
incrusted
with
blackened
tallow
hang
from
the
roof
and
strings
of
little
bells
from
wall
to
wall
which
are
plucked
by
each
recipient
of
the
sacred
elements
as
he
returns
to
his
stand
in
this
gloomy
building
prayers
are
said
as
in
all
nestorian
churches
at
sunrise
and
sunset
by
the
priest
in
his
ordinary
clothing
the
villagers
being
summoned
by
the
beating
of
a
mallet
on
a
board
the
church
is
a
place
of
refuge
when
a
kurdish
attack
is
expected
nine
years
ago
the
people
carried
into
it
all
their
movables
that
they
valued
most
believing
it
to
be
secure
but
the
kurds
broke
in
in
force
and
took
all
they
wanted
the
few
sacred
treasures
of
the
village
and
the
eucharistic
leaven
are
hidden
in
an
elevated
recess
in
the
wall
the
graveyard
which
contains
only
a
few
flat
slabs
imbedded
in
the
soil
is
the
only
possible
but
though
it
is
clean
and
neat
it
looked
so
damp
and
felt
so
cold
that
i
preferred
to
accept
a
big
room
with
walls
six
feet
thick
in
the
priest
house
even
though
it
overhangs
the
torrent
with
its
thunder
and
clash
many
a
strange
house
i
have
seen
but
never
anything
so
striking
as
the
dwelling
of
ishai
passing
through
the
rude
verandah
and
through
a
lofty
room
nearly
dark
with
a
rough
stone
dais
on
which
were
some
mattresses
and
berths
one
above
another
i
stumbled
in
total
darkness
into
a
room
seventy
feet
by
forty
and
twenty
feet
or
more
high
in
its
highest
part
it
has
no
particular
shape
and
wanders
away
from
this
lofty
centre
into
low
irregular
caverns
and
recesses
excavated
in
the
mountain
side
parts
of
the
floor
are
of
naked
rock
parts
of
damp
earth
in
one
rocky
recess
is
a
powerful
spring
of
pure
water
the
roofs
are
supported
on
barked
stems
of
trees
black
like
the
walls
wherever
it
was
possible
to
see
them
with
the
smoke
of
two
centuries
ancient
oil
lamps
on
posts
or
in
recesses
rendered
darkness
visible
with
the
legs
sticking
out
containing
butter
hanging
from
the
blackened
and
wheat
apples
potatoes
and
onions
in
heaps
and
sacks
piles
of
wool
great
wooden
cradles
here
and
there
huge
oil
and
water
jars
wooden
stools
piles
of
bedding
ploughs
threshing
instruments
long
guns
swords
spears
and
gear
encumbered
the
floor
while
much
more
was
stowed
away
in
the
dim
caverns
of
the
rock
i
asked
the
number
of
families
under
the
roof
seven
ovens
was
the
reply
this
meant
seven
families
and
it
is
true
that
three
generations
persons
live
cook
sleep
and
pursue
their
avocations
under
that
patriarchal
roof
the
road
is
a
bad
one
for
laden
beasts
and
very
dangerous
besides
and
the
few
travellers
who
visit
kochanes
usually
take
the
caravan
route
from
urmi
diza
and
the
fact
of
an
english
person
passing
through
marbishu
with
a
letter
to
the
turkish
authorities
was
soon
noised
abroad
and
i
was
invited
to
spend
the
evening
in
this
most
picturesque
house
all
the
inmates
were
there
and
over
a
hundred
of
the
villagers
besides
and
cooking
baking
spinning
carding
wool
knitting
and
cleaning
swords
and
guns
went
on
all
the
time
there
were
women
and
girls
in
bright
red
dresses
men
reclining
on
bedding
already
unrolled
on
the
uneven
floor
or
standing
in
knots
in
their
picturesque
dresses
leaning
on
their
long
guns
with
daggers
gleaming
in
their
belts
groups
seated
round
the
great
fire
in
the
uncertain
light
of
which
faces
gleamed
here
and
there
in
the
dim
recesses
while
the
towering
form
of
ishai
loomed
grandly
through
the
smoke
as
the
culmination
of
the
artistic
effect
the
subject
discussed
was
equally
interesting
to
the
syrians
and
to
me
the
dangers
of
the
pass
and
the
number
of
guards
necessary
we
talked
late
into
the
night
and
long
before
i
left
the
female
and
juvenile
part
of
the
family
had
retired
to
their
beds
again
i
heard
of
hesso
misdeeds
of
the
robbery
of
sheep
of
the
driving
off
on
the
previous
morning
of
thirty
sheep
which
they
were
about
to
barter
for
their
winter
supply
of
wheat
of
the
oppressive
taxation
nearly
on
houses
of
the
unchecked
depredations
of
the
kurds
which
had
increased
this
summer
and
autumn
leaving
them
too
poor
to
pay
their
taxes
of
a
life
of
peril
and
fear
and
apprehension
for
their
women
which
is
scarcely
bearable
of
the
oppression
of
man
and
the
silence
of
god
underlying
all
is
a
feeling
of
bitter
disappointment
that
england
which
has
helped
the
oppressed
elsewhere
does
nothing
for
us
they
thought
they
said
that
when
the
english
priests
came
it
was
the
beginning
of
succour
and
that
the
lord
was
no
longer
deaf
and
our
faces
were
lightened
but
now
it
is
all
dark
and
there
is
no
help
in
god
or
man
i
now
find
myself
in
the
midst
of
a
state
of
things
of
which
i
was
completely
ignorant
and
for
which
i
was
utterly
unprepared
and
in
a
region
full
of
fear
and
danger
in
which
our
are
the
nearly
helpless
prey
of
fanatical
mountaineers
whose
profession
is
robbery
illustration
a
syrian
family
looking
round
on
the
handsome
men
and
comely
women
who
would
greet
the
sunrise
with
christian
prayer
and
praise
and
whose
ancestors
have
worshipped
christ
as
god
for
fourteen
centuries
in
these
mountain
fastnesses
i
wondered
much
at
my
former
apathy
concerning
them
it
is
easier
to
them
our
on
the
spot
than
to
put
the
feeling
into
words
but
writing
here
in
the
house
of
their
patriarch
the
of
the
east
i
realise
that
the
cross
signed
on
their
brows
in
baptism
is
to
them
as
to
us
the
symbol
of
triumph
and
of
hope
that
by
them
as
by
us
the
eucharistic
emblems
are
received
for
the
life
of
the
soul
in
remembrance
of
meritorious
cross
and
passion
that
through
ages
of
accumulating
wrongs
and
almost
unrivalled
misery
they
like
us
have
worshipped
the
crucified
nazarene
as
the
crowned
and
risen
christ
that
to
him
with
us
they
bend
the
adoring
knee
and
that
like
us
they
lay
their
dead
in
consecrated
ground
to
await
through
him
a
joyful
resurrection
there
were
five
degrees
of
frost
during
the
night
and
as
i
lay
awake
from
cold
the
narratives
i
had
heard
and
the
extraordinary
state
of
things
in
which
i
so
unexpectedly
found
myself
made
a
very
deep
impression
on
me
there
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
came
into
contact
with
people
grossly
ignorant
truly
but
willing
to
suffer
the
loss
of
all
things
and
to
live
in
jeopardy
every
hour
for
religious
beliefs
which
are
not
otherwise
specially
influential
in
their
lives
my
own
circumstances
too
claimed
some
consideration
whether
to
go
forward
or
back
to
urmi
it
is
obvious
from
what
i
hear
that
the
bringing
my
journey
to
erzerum
to
a
successful
issue
will
depend
almost
altogether
on
my
own
nerve
judgment
and
power
of
arranging
and
that
at
best
there
will
be
serious
risks
hardships
and
difficulties
which
will
increase
as
winter
sets
in
after
nearly
coming
to
the
cowardly
decision
to
return
i
despised
myself
for
the
weakness
and
having
decided
that
some
good
to
these
people
might
come
from
farther
acquaintance
with
their
circumstances
i
fell
asleep
and
now
the
die
is
cast
we
were
ready
at
daybreak
the
next
morning
but
for
the
same
reasons
as
those
given
at
merwana
did
not
start
till
seven
for
an
eleven
hours
march
i
took
two
armed
horsemen
and
six
armed
footmen
all
fine
fellows
used
to
the
work
of
reconnoitring
and
protecting
three
of
them
scouted
the
whole
time
high
up
on
the
sides
of
the
pass
not
with
the
purposeless
sensational
scouting
of
persian
but
with
the
earnestness
of
men
who
were
pledged
to
take
us
safely
through
and
who
live
under
arms
to
protect
their
property
and
families
after
five
hours
of
toiling
up
the
drinayi
pass
taking
several
deep
fords
and
being
detained
by
a
baggage
horse
falling
fifty
feet
with
his
load
we
crossed
the
summit
and
by
a
long
descent
through
hills
of
rounded
outlines
covered
with
uncut
hay
reached
the
plain
of
gawar
where
the
guards
left
us
on
the
way
we
passed
the
small
christian
hamlet
of
eyal
which
was
robbed
of
its
sheep
with
the
sacrifice
of
the
shepherd
life
the
following
night
at
the
village
of
yekmala
on
the
plain
the
kurdish
by
a
shameful
exaction
got
us
into
great
trouble
and
there
was
a
fight
in
which
gun
was
wrested
from
him
and
some
of
my
things
were
taken
the
kurds
meantime
driving
off
their
animals
at
a
fast
trot
the
aspect
of
affairs
was
so
very
bad
and
the
attack
on
my
men
so
violent
that
i
paid
the
value
of
the
kurdish
depredations
and
we
got
away
a
little
farther
on
the
were
extremely
outrageous
and
began
to
fulfil
their
threat
of
throwing
down
their
loads
but
i
persuaded
who
was
alarmed
and
anxious
to
leave
them
behind
and
they
thought
better
of
it
the
plain
of
gawar
is
a
paradise
of
fertility
with
abundant
water
and
has
a
rich
black
soil
capable
of
yielding
twenty
or
thirtyfold
to
the
cultivator
on
it
is
the
town
of
diza
chiefly
armenian
which
is
a
turkish
customs
station
a
military
post
and
the
residence
of
a
kaimakam
there
are
over
twenty
christian
as
well
as
some
moslem
villages
on
gawar
and
a
number
of
kurdish
hamlets
and
castles
on
the
slopes
and
in
the
folds
of
the
hills
above
it
the
sun
was
sinking
as
we
embarked
on
the
plain
and
above
the
waves
of
sunset
gold
which
flooded
it
rose
the
icy
spires
and
crags
of
the
glorious
jelu
ranges
and
the
splintered
kanisairani
summits
the
plain
has
an
altitude
of
over
feet
and
there
was
a
sharp
frost
as
we
dismounted
at
the
village
of
pirzala
and
put
up
at
the
house
of
the
david
having
been
eleven
and
a
half
hours
in
the
saddle
after
consulting
with
him
and
other
village
worthies
i
dismissed
the
and
paid
them
more
than
their
contract
price
the
next
morning
they
swore
by
the
prophet
beard
and
every
other
sacred
thing
that
they
had
not
been
paid
and
when
payment
was
proved
by
two
respectable
witnesses
they
were
not
the
least
abashed
poor
fellows
they
know
no
better
and
are
doubtless
very
poor
i
was
glad
to
get
rid
of
their
sinister
faces
and
outbreaks
of
violence
but
for
some
days
it
was
impossible
being
to
obtain
transport
to
kochanes
though
i
was
able
to
leave
pirzala
for
other
villages
the
next
day
mists
rolled
down
the
mountains
and
a
good
cold
english
rain
set
in
in
which
i
had
a
most
pleasant
ride
to
diza
which
was
repeated
the
following
day
in
glorious
weather
the
snow
coming
down
the
mountain
sides
i
was
surreptitiously
on
turkish
soil
and
it
was
necessary
to
show
my
passport
to
the
diza
officials
get
a
permit
to
travel
and
have
my
baggage
examined
ishu
the
present
of
the
plain
through
whom
all
business
between
the
christians
and
the
government
is
transacted
accompanied
us
to
the
mutessarif
of
julamerik
diza
is
an
unwalled
town
on
an
eminence
crowned
by
barracks
the
garrison
of
men
was
reduced
to
six
during
the
summer
the
kurds
evidently
took
the
reduction
as
a
hint
to
them
to
do
what
they
liked
and
they
have
mercilessly
ravaged
and
harried
the
plain
for
months
past
an
official
assured
me
that
sheep
have
been
driven
off
from
the
gawar
christian
villages
between
the
middle
of
june
and
the
of
october
partly
by
the
nomad
herkis
there
are
now
sixty
soldiers
at
diza
and
the
mutessarif
of
julamerik
is
there
having
come
down
to
capture
abdurrahman
bey
one
of
the
great
oppressors
of
the
christians
an
attempt
rendered
abortive
it
is
said
by
a
bribe
given
by
the
bey
to
the
commanding
officer
of
the
troops
i
was
interested
in
my
first
visit
to
a
turkish
official
his
room
was
above
a
stable
with
a
dark
and
difficult
access
and
the
passages
above
were
crowded
with
soldiers
the
mutessarif
sat
on
a
divan
at
the
upper
end
of
a
shabby
room
an
elderly
man
much
like
gladstone
very
courteous
and
gentlemanly
with
plenty
of
conversation
and
he
said
that
the
letter
i
carry
is
a
very
powerful
document
that
it
supersedes
all
the
usual
formalities
that
my
baggage
would
not
even
be
looked
at
and
that
i
should
not
require
a
or
permit
by
his
advice
i
called
on
the
kaimakam
and
in
each
room
a
soldier
brought
in
delicious
coffee
the
kaimakam
was
also
very
courteous
and
talked
agreeably
and
intelligently
both
taking
the
initiative
as
etiquette
demands
in
this
and
in
the
general
tone
there
was
a
marked
difference
between
persian
and
turkish
officialdom
the
persian
governor
is
surrounded
by
civilians
the
turkish
by
soldiers
and
in
the
latter
case
the
manner
assumed
by
subordinates
is
one
of
the
most
profound
respect
the
sealing
of
my
passport
took
a
considerable
time
during
which
with
i
paid
several
visits
was
regaled
with
armenian
cookery
tried
to
change
a
at
the
treasury
but
found
it
absolutely
empty
and
went
to
see
a
new
testament
said
to
be
of
great
antiquity
in
an
armenian
house
it
was
hanging
on
the
wall
in
a
leather
bag
from
which
depended
strings
of
blue
and
onyx
beads
sick
people
come
to
it
even
from
great
distances
as
well
as
the
friends
of
those
who
are
themselves
too
ill
to
travel
the
bag
can
only
be
opened
by
a
priest
the
power
of
healing
depends
on
a
sum
of
money
being
paid
to
the
priest
and
the
owners
the
sick
person
receives
a
glass
bead
and
is
forthwith
cured
on
gawar
plain
i
lodged
in
the
village
houses
either
in
hovels
in
which
the
families
live
with
their
horses
and
buffaloes
or
in
rooms
over
stables
very
many
sick
people
came
to
me
for
medicines
and
others
with
tales
of
wrong
for
conveyance
to
the
consul
at
erzerum
no
one
seemed
to
trust
any
one
these
conversations
were
always
held
at
night
in
whispers
with
the
candle
hidden
under
a
bushel
the
filled
up
with
straw
the
door
barred
or
a
heavy
stone
laid
against
it
and
a
watch
outside
the
gawar
christians
are
industrious
and
inoffensive
and
have
no
higher
aspiration
than
to
be
let
alone
but
they
are
the
victims
of
a
kurdish
rapacity
which
leaves
them
little
more
than
necessary
food
their
villages
usually
belong
to
kurdish
aghas
who
take
from
them
double
the
lawful
taxes
and
tithes
the
herkis
sweep
over
the
plain
in
their
autumn
migration
like
a
locust
cloud
carrying
off
the
possessions
of
the
miserable
people
spoiling
their
granaries
and
driving
off
their
flocks
the
kurds
of
the
neighbouring
slopes
and
mountains
rob
them
by
violence
at
night
and
in
the
day
by
exactions
made
under
threat
of
death
the
latter
mode
of
robbery
is
called
demand
the
servants
of
a
kurdish
bey
enter
and
ask
for
some
jars
of
oil
or
a
kashmir
shawl
women
ornaments
a
jewelled
dagger
or
a
good
foal
under
certain
threats
or
they
show
the
owner
a
bullet
in
the
palm
of
the
hand
intimating
that
a
bullet
through
his
head
will
be
his
fate
if
he
refuses
to
give
up
his
property
or
informs
any
one
of
the
demand
in
this
way
among
innumerable
other
instances
my
host
at
a
man
had
been
robbed
of
five
valuable
shawls
such
as
descend
from
mother
to
daughter
four
handsome
coats
and
in
silver
in
the
last
two
years
ten
and
fifteen
loads
of
wheat
have
been
taken
from
him
and
four
jars
filled
with
oil
and
four
hundred
and
fifty
sheep
have
likewise
been
seized
by
violence
leaving
him
only
and
one
night
while
i
was
at
his
house
of
the
remaining
village
sheep
some
of
which
were
his
were
driven
off
in
spite
of
the
guards
who
not
i
was
awakened
by
the
disturbance
and
as
it
was
a
light
night
i
saw
that
the
kurds
who
attacked
the
sheepfold
were
armed
with
modern
guns
the
of
that
village
and
this
man
brother
have
both
been
shot
by
the
kurds
testimony
concurred
in
stating
that
the
insecurity
of
life
and
property
has
enormously
increased
this
summer
especially
since
the
reduction
of
the
diza
garrison
that
things
have
grown
very
much
worse
since
the
erzerum
troubles
that
the
kurds
have
been
more
audacious
in
their
demands
and
more
reckless
of
human
life
and
that
of
late
they
have
threatened
the
christians
saying
that
the
government
would
approve
of
their
getting
rid
of
them
very
little
of
any
value
the
people
said
was
left
to
them
and
the
extreme
bareness
of
their
dwellings
and
the
emptiness
of
their
stables
and
sheepfolds
while
surrounded
with
possibilities
of
pastoral
and
agricultural
wealth
tend
to
sustain
their
statements
the
men
of
government
they
all
said
are
in
partnership
with
the
kurds
and
receive
of
their
gains
this
is
our
curse
many
women
and
girls
especially
at
charviva
and
vasivawa
have
been
maltreated
by
the
kurds
a
fortnight
ago
a
girl
ten
years
old
going
out
from
to
carry
bread
to
the
reapers
was
abducted
it
became
known
that
two
girls
in
were
to
be
carried
off
and
they
were
hidden
at
first
in
a
hole
near
their
last
week
was
known
only
to
their
father
who
carried
them
food
and
water
every
second
night
he
came
to
me
in
the
dark
secretly
and
asked
me
to
bring
them
up
here
where
they
might
find
a
temporary
asylum
daily
and
nightly
during
the
week
of
my
visit
gawar
was
harried
by
the
kurds
who
in
two
instances
burned
what
they
could
not
carry
away
the
glare
of
the
blazing
sheaves
lighting
up
the
plain
the
people
of
gawar
express
great
anxiety
for
teachers
the
priests
and
deacons
must
work
like
labourers
and
can
not
they
say
go
down
to
urmi
for
instruction
a
priest
speaking
for
two
others
and
for
several
deacons
who
were
present
said
beseech
for
a
teacher
to
come
and
sit
among
us
and
lighten
our
darkness
before
we
pass
away
as
the
morning
shadows
we
are
blind
guides
we
know
nothing
and
our
people
are
as
sheep
lost
upon
the
mountains
when
they
go
down
into
the
darkness
of
their
graves
we
know
not
how
to
give
them
any
light
and
so
we
all
perish
this
request
was
made
in
one
of
the
large
dwellings
which
serve
for
both
men
and
beasts
in
kurdistan
the
firelight
flickered
on
horses
and
buffaloes
receding
into
the
darkness
and
the
square
on
which
we
sat
was
framed
by
the
long
horns
and
curly
heads
of
oxen
i
answered
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
raise
money
for
such
an
object
in
england
but
england
is
very
rich
the
priest
replied
i
looked
round
and
the
thought
passed
across
my
mind
of
him
who
though
he
was
rich
yet
for
our
sakes
became
poor
whose
life
of
from
the
stable
at
bethlehem
to
the
cross
on
calvary
is
the
example
for
our
own
and
whose
voice
ringing
down
through
ages
of
luxury
and
selfishness
still
declares
that
discipleship
involves
a
love
for
our
brethren
equal
to
his
own
yes
england
is
very
rich
and
these
syrians
are
very
poor
and
have
kept
the
faith
through
ages
of
darkness
and
persecution
this
plain
the
richest
in
kurdistan
is
also
most
beautiful
in
winter
a
frozen
morass
it
is
not
dry
enough
for
sowing
till
may
and
even
june
this
accounts
for
the
lateness
of
the
harvest
the
jelu
mountains
the
highest
in
central
kurdistan
a
mass
of
crags
spires
and
fantastic
parapets
of
rock
with
rifts
and
abysses
of
extraordinary
depth
come
down
almost
directly
upon
it
there
is
no
wood
the
villages
are
all
alike
surrounded
just
now
by
piles
of
wheat
and
straw
on
their
with
truncated
cones
of
fodder
and
high
smooth
black
cones
of
animal
fuel
these
are
often
the
only
signs
of
habitations
one
may
ride
over
the
roofs
without
knowing
that
houses
are
below
being
entirely
baffled
by
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
transport
i
went
on
to
gahgoran
and
put
up
at
the
house
of
the
parish
priest
where
the
subterranean
granary
allotted
to
me
was
so
completely
dark
that
i
sat
all
day
in
the
sheepfold
in
order
to
be
able
to
write
and
work
shifting
my
position
as
the
sun
shifted
his
a
had
been
sent
from
diza
who
guarded
me
so
sedulously
that
dared
not
speak
to
me
lest
the
man
should
think
he
was
giving
me
information
gahgoran
was
full
of
strangers
the
patriarch
had
come
down
from
kochanes
and
occupied
the
only
room
in
the
village
whither
i
went
to
pay
my
respects
to
him
the
room
was
nearly
dark
and
foggy
with
tobacco
smoke
but
a
ray
of
light
fell
on
mar
gauriel
bishop
of
urmi
a
handsome
man
in
a
nestorian
turban
full
trousers
a
frock
with
a
bright
girdle
in
which
a
glittered
and
a
robe
over
all
a
leader
of
armed
men
in
appearance
i
had
met
him
in
urmi
and
he
shook
hands
and
presented
me
to
mar
shimun
a
swarthy
man
in
his
turn
he
presented
me
to
mar
sergis
bishop
of
jelu
a
man
with
a
superb
gray
beard
the
of
an
oriental
ecclesiastic
and
headmen
of
villages
sat
round
the
room
against
the
wall
not
met
for
any
spiritual
conclave
but
for
stern
business
regarding
the
taxes
for
the
patriarch
is
a
salaried
official
of
the
turkish
government
all
rose
when
i
entered
and
according
to
a
polite
custom
stood
till
i
sat
down
they
held
out
no
hope
of
getting
baggage
animals
and
i
returned
to
the
sheepfold
it
was
a
long
day
the
servants
did
not
arrive
till
night
and
kochanes
receded
hourly
many
people
came
for
medicine
and
among
them
a
very
handsome
man
whose
house
was
entered
by
kurds
a
month
ago
who
threatened
him
with
death
unless
he
surrendered
his
possessions
after
this
he
and
his
brothers
fled
and
hid
among
the
wheat
but
fearing
to
be
found
and
killed
they
concealed
themselves
for
a
fortnight
in
the
tall
reeds
of
a
marsh
he
is
now
subject
to
violent
fits
of
trembling
my
illness
is
fear
the
poor
fellow
said
three
hundred
sheep
had
been
taken
from
him
and
gold
his
grass
had
been
burned
and
now
he
said
the
oppressor
hazela
bey
says
me
the
deeds
of
your
lands
if
not
i
will
kill
you
he
had
been
a
and
was
so
rich
that
he
entertained
travellers
and
their
horses
at
all
times
now
his
friends
have
to
give
him
wheat
wherewith
to
make
bread
the
house
of
jammo
has
granaries
at
each
side
of
the
low
door
a
long
dark
passage
leading
into
a
subterranean
stable
with
a
platform
for
guests
and
a
on
a
small
scale
like
the
one
at
marbishu
a
space
was
cleared
in
the
granary
for
my
bed
among
wheat
straw
ploughs
beetles
starved
cats
osier
graintubs
coated
with
clay
six
feet
high
and
agricultural
gear
of
all
sorts
it
was
a
horrid
place
and
the
door
would
not
bolt
after
midnight
i
was
awakened
by
a
sound
as
if
big
rats
were
gnawing
the
beams
i
got
up
and
groping
my
way
to
the
door
heard
it
more
loudly
went
into
the
passage
looked
through
the
chinks
in
the
outer
door
and
saw
a
number
of
kurds
armed
with
guns
i
retreated
and
fired
my
revolver
in
the
granary
which
roused
the
dogs
and
the
dogs
roused
the
twenty
strangers
who
were
receiving
the
priest
hospitality
in
the
stable
were
fourteen
horses
including
my
own
two
and
several
buffaloes
the
kurds
had
dug
through
the
roof
of
the
granary
opposite
mine
and
through
its
wall
into
the
stable
and
were
on
the
point
of
driving
out
the
horses
through
the
common
passage
when
the
hardy
mountaineers
rushed
upon
them
the
same
night
though
it
was
light
and
clear
another
house
in
gahgoran
was
dug
into
and
a
valuable
horse
belonging
to
a
man
in
the
patriarch
train
was
abstracted
a
descent
was
also
made
on
the
neighbouring
village
of
vasivawa
which
has
suffered
severely
eight
employed
by
the
villagers
at
a
high
price
to
watch
the
and
my
own
escort
were
close
at
hand
horses
having
at
last
been
obtained
from
a
kurdish
bey
i
left
on
tuesday
the
gahgoran
people
being
stupefied
with
dismay
at
the
growing
audacity
of
the
kurds
the
mountain
road
was
very
dangerous
but
i
travelled
with
mar
gauriel
and
his
train
thirteen
well
armed
and
mounted
men
besides
armed
servants
on
foot
the
ice
was
half
an
inch
thick
but
the
sun
was
very
hot
the
mountain
views
were
superb
and
the
scenery
altogether
glorious
but
the
passes
and
hillsides
are
not
inhabited
we
were
ten
hours
on
the
journey
owing
to
the
custom
of
frequent
halts
for
smoking
and
talking
in
the
afternoon
a
party
of
syrians
with
some
unladen
baggage
mules
came
over
the
crest
of
a
hill
preceded
by
a
figure
certainly
not
syrian
this
was
a
bearded
man
with
hair
falling
over
his
shoulders
dressed
in
a
girdled
cassock
which
had
once
been
black
tucked
up
so
as
to
reveal
some
curious
nether
garments
syrian
socks
and
a
pair
of
rope
and
worsted
shoes
such
as
the
mountaineers
wear
in
scaling
heights
on
his
head
where
one
would
have
expected
to
see
a
college
trencher
was
a
high
conical
cap
of
white
felt
with
a
of
black
silk
twisted
into
a
rope
the
true
tyari
turban
this
was
browne
one
of
the
english
mission
clergy
who
from
living
for
nearly
four
years
among
the
syrians
of
the
mountains
helping
them
and
loving
them
has
almost
become
one
of
them
he
was
going
to
diza
to
get
winter
supplies
before
his
departure
for
one
of
the
most
inaccessible
of
the
mountain
valleys
but
with
considerate
kindness
turned
back
to
kochanes
with
me
and
remains
here
until
i
leave
this
fortunate
adds
the
finishing
touch
to
the
interest
of
this
most
fascinating
kurdistan
journey
crossing
the
kandal
pass
we
descended
on
the
hamlet
of
shawutha
superbly
situated
on
a
steep
declivity
at
the
head
of
a
tremendous
ravine
leading
to
the
zab
blocked
apparently
by
mountains
against
a
crimson
sky
with
an
isolated
precipitous
rock
in
the
foreground
crowned
by
an
ancient
church
difficult
of
access
below
the
village
are
fair
shelving
lawns
with
groups
of
great
walnut
trees
hawthorn
and
ash
yellow
tawny
and
crimson
a
scene
of
perfect
beauty
in
the
sunset
while
the
fallen
leaves
touched
the
soft
green
turf
with
ruddy
gold
the
were
very
fair
but
the
villagers
dared
not
let
me
camp
the
kurds
were
about
and
had
exacted
a
ewe
and
lamb
from
every
house
owing
to
the
influx
of
strangers
it
was
difficult
to
get
any
shelter
and
i
slept
in
a
horse
and
ox
stable
burrowed
in
the
hillside
the
passage
to
the
family
without
any
air
holes
hot
and
stifling
and
used
my
woollen
sheets
for
curtains
the
village
is
grievously
smitten
by
the
cattle
plague
in
telling
me
of
the
loss
of
four
bulls
within
three
days
my
host
used
an
expression
which
is
not
uncommon
here
by
the
wealth
of
god
and
the
head
of
mar
shimun
yesterday
we
descended
feet
alongside
of
a
torrent
fringed
with
scarlet
woods
and
halted
where
the
shawutha
kochanes
and
diz
valleys
meet
at
the
fords
of
the
zab
here
known
as
the
pison
the
river
of
eden
the
zab
only
fordable
at
certain
seasons
is
there
a
dark
green
river
fully
sixty
yards
wide
deep
enough
to
take
the
footmen
up
to
their
waists
and
strong
enough
to
make
them
stagger
with
a
lawn
bright
with
autumnal
foliage
below
the
savage
and
lofty
mountains
on
its
right
bank
from
the
zab
we
ascended
the
gorge
of
the
kochanes
water
by
a
wild
mountain
path
at
times
cut
into
steps
or
scaffolded
and
at
other
times
merely
a
glistening
track
over
shelving
rock
terminating
in
a
steep
and
difficult
ascent
to
the
fair
green
alp
on
which
kochanes
stands
at
the
feet
of
three
imposing
peaks
of
naked
rock
quhaibalak
qwarah
and
barchallah
thus
i
beheld
at
last
the
goal
of
my
journey
from
luristan
and
was
not
disappointed
glorious
indeed
is
this
kurdistan
world
of
mountains
piled
up
in
masses
of
peaks
and
precipices
cleft
by
ravines
in
which
the
ashirets
and
yezidis
find
shelter
every
peak
every
ravine
flaming
with
autumn
tints
and
here
where
the
ridges
are
the
sharpest
and
the
rock
spires
are
the
most
imposing
on
a
spur
between
the
torrents
of
the
terpai
and
the
yezidi
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
gorges
and
precipices
is
this
little
mountain
village
the
latest
refuge
of
the
head
of
a
church
once
the
most
powerful
in
the
east
kochanes
consists
of
a
church
built
on
the
verge
of
a
precipice
many
tombs
a
grove
of
poplars
a
sloping
lawn
scattered
village
houses
and
extending
up
the
alp
and
nearly
on
the
edge
of
a
precipitous
cliff
the
patriarch
residence
a
plain
low
collection
of
stone
buildings
having
an
arched
entrance
and
a
tower
for
refuge
or
defence
the
houses
of
his
numerous
relations
are
grouped
near
it
everything
is
singularly
picturesque
the
people
being
afraid
of
an
attack
from
the
kurds
would
not
suffer
me
to
pitch
my
tent
on
their
fair
meadow
and
sulti
the
patriarch
sister
has
installed
me
in
a
good
room
in
the
house
looking
across
the
tremendous
ravine
of
the
terpai
upon
savage
mountains
the
lower
skirts
of
which
are
clothed
with
the
tawny
foliage
of
the
scrub
oak
and
their
upper
heights
with
snow
footnotes
i
have
since
heard
that
these
kurds
a
short
time
afterwards
betrayed
some
christian
travellers
into
the
hands
of
some
of
their
own
people
by
whom
they
were
robbed
and
brutally
maltreated
i
give
the
story
as
it
was
repeatedly
told
to
me
it
was
a
very
shady
and
complicated
transaction
throughout

interesting
volume

of

opens
his
door
to
all
who
turn
unto

will
repent
all
my
days
are
past
and
gone
my
faults
still
remain
o
christ
have
mercy
upon
me
have
mercy
upon
me
about
christmas
in
constantinople
i
had
an
opportunity
of
laying
the
state
of
the
gawar
christians
and
the
reduction
of
the
garrison
of
diza
before
his
highness
kiamil
pasha
then
grand
vizier
he
appeared
deeply
interested
and
said
that
it
was
the
purpose
of
his
government
to
send
troops
up
to
the
region
as
soon
as
the
roads
were
open
since
then
i
have
heard
nothing
of
these
people
but
as
this
sheet
is
going
to
press
i
have
received
the
following
news
from
shedd
of
urmi
you
will
be
glad
to
know
that
gawar
is
very
much
changed
for
the
better
the
turkish
governor
has
been
removed
and
another
of
far
better
character
and
ability
has
the
post
the
kurdish
robbers
have
been
arrested
and
their
leader
abdurrahman
bey
killed
the
complaints
to
which
i
became
a
listener
were
made
by
bishops
priests
headmen
and
others
exaggerations
prevail
and
the
same
story
is
often
told
with
as
many
variations
as
there
are
narrators
i
can
not
vouch
for
anything
which
did
not
come
under
my
own
observation
some
narratives
dissolved
under
investigation
leaving
a
mere
nucleus
of
fact
those
which
i
thought
worthy
of
being
noted
down
some
of
which
were
published
in
the
in
may
and
june
in
two
papers
called
shadow
of
the
were
either
fortified
by
corroborative
circumstances
or
rest
on
the
concurrent
testimony
as
to
the
main
facts
of
three
independent
narrators
in
some
cases
i
was
asked
to
lay
the
statements
before
the
british
consul
at
erzerum
with
the
names
of
the
narrators
as
the
authority
on
which
they
rested
but
in
the
greater
number
i
was
implored
not
to
give
names
or
places
or
any
means
of
identification
we
are
in
fear
of
our
lives
if
we
tell
the
truth
they
urged
sometimes
i
asked
them
if
they
would
abide
by
what
they
told
me
in
the
event
of
an
investigation
by
the
british
at
van
no
no
no
we
dare
not
was
the
usual
reply
under
these
circumstances
the
only
course
open
to
me
is
to
withhold
the
names
of
persons
and
places
wherever
i
was
pledged
to
do
so
but
as
a
guarantee
of
good
faith
i
have
placed
the
statements
confidentially
with
the
names
in
the
hands
of
her
majesty
principal
secretary
of
state
for
foreign
affairs
letter
xxix
kochanes
after
two
days
the
patriarch
arrived
from
gahgoran
with
nearly
forty
persons
to
realise
what
this
house
is
like
one
must
go
back
four
centuries
to
the
mode
of
living
of
the
medieval
barons
of
england
mar
shimun
is
not
only
a
spiritual
prince
but
the
temporal
ruler
of
the
syrians
of
the
plains
and
valleys
and
of
the
ashirets
or
tribal
syrians
of
the
mountains
of
central
kurdistan
as
well
as
a
judge
and
a
salaried
official
of
the
turkish
government
he
appoints
the
or
lay
rulers
of
each
district
where
the
office
is
not
hereditary
and
possesses
ecclesiastical
patronage
for
over
four
centuries
the
patriarch
has
been
of
the
family
of
shimun
which
is
regarded
as
the
royal
family
and
he
is
assisted
in
managing
affairs
by
a
family
council
kochanes
is
thus
the
ecclesiastical
and
political
metropolis
of
the
syrian
nation
and
the
innumerable
disputes
which
arise
among
the
people
of
this
region
are
brought
here
for
judgment
and
arbitration
it
is
a
crowded
life
from
sunrise
to
sunset
the
pavement
outside
the
rude
hall
of
entrance
the
great
room
like
that
at
marbishu
where
sulti
presides
and
the
are
always
thronged
with
men
waiting
to
be
received
by
the
patriarch
sleeping
on
the
big
settle
in
the
hall
or
cleaning
swords
and
guns
or
wrestling
performing
feats
of
horsemanship
playing
chess
and
eating
sixty
persons
more
or
less
are
guests
here
every
one
coming
into
the
valley
is
received
and
horses
are
stabled
while
men
are
fed
outside
sheep
and
fowls
are
being
continually

oxen
are
bringing
in
hay
and
perpetual
measuring
and
weighing
are
going
on
the
cost
of
provisioning
such
an
army
of
guests
is
enormous
and
presses
heavily
on
the
patriarch
slender
resources
intrigues
are
rife
in
some
ways
every
man
hand
is
against
his
fellow
and
the
succession
to
the
patriarchate
although
nominally
settled
is
a
subject
of
scheming
plotting
rivalries
and
jealousies
then
there
are
various
appointments
secular
and
spiritual
to
be
wrangled
for
the
difficult
relations
with
turkey
to
be
managed
and
such
a
wavering
policy
to
be
shaped
towards
rome
and
american
presbyterianism
as
shall
absolutely
break
with
neither
among
the

by

there
is
business
again
and
unlimited
talk
with
unlimited
smoking
till
five
when

goes
to
prayers
at

after
which
everybody
is
at
liberty
to
attend

and

go
on

it

a
life
without

the

of

litigation
tribal
feuds
the
difficulty
of
raising
the
tribute
the
gossip
of
the
village
and
just
now
above
all
else
the
excesses
of
the
kurds
form
the
staple
of
conversation
as
i
understand
from
who
as
a
personal
friend
spends
much
of
the
day
in
the
patriarch
room
in
winter
when
kochanes
is
snowed
up
chess
and
the
pranks
and
witticisms
of
the
jester
fill
up
the
time
the
curious
little
court
the
rigid
etiquette
the
clank
of
arms
the
unbounded
hospitality
and
the
political
and
judicial
functions
exercised
by
the
patriarch
with
the
rude
dwelling
and
furnishings
combine
to
the
baronial
life
as
it
might
have
been
lived
in
roslin
or
warkworth
castles
though
i
had
mar
shimun
at
gahgoran
i
was
only
formally
presented
after
his
arrival
here
it
is
proper
for
a
woman
to
cover
her
head
before
him
and
i
put
on
my
hat
and
took
off
my
shoes
his
room
is
well
paved
the
plaster
is
newly
coloured
and
there
is
a
glazed
window
with
a
magnificent
prospect
there
were
rugs
at
one
end
on
which
the
patriarch
was
seated
with
two
chairs
at
his
left
hand
he
rose
to
receive
me
and
according
to
custom
i
kissed
his
hand
he
took
my
letter
of
introduction
and
put
it
under
a
cushion
as
etiquette
demanded
and
asked
me
to
be
seated
on
the
floor
along
the
walls
were
bishops
priests
deacons
jelu
and
tyari
mountaineers
lowlanders
from
urmi
and
men
of
the
shimun
family
all
most
picturesquely
dressed
and
smoking
long
wooden
pipes
on
each
subsequent
occasion
when
i
paid
my
respects
to
him
he
was
similarly
surrounded
browne
acted
as
interpreter
but
nothing
but
very
superficial
conversation
was
possible
when
there
was
the
risk
that
anything
said
might
be
twisted
into
dangerous
use
mar
shimun
is
a
man
about
the
middle
height
with
large
dark
eyes
a
sallow
complexion
a
grizzled
beard
and
an
expression
of
profound
melancholy
mingled
with
a
most
painful
look
of
perplexity
and
irresolution
he
can
not
be
over
fifty
but
the
miseries
and
intrigues
around
him
make
him
appear
prematurely
old
when
i
approached
the
subject
of
the
anarchy
of
the
country
he
glared
timidly
and
fearfully
round
and
changed
the
subject
sending
me
a
message
afterwards
that
and
kwaja
shlimon
a
chaldæan
educated
in
paris
are
in
possession
of
all
that
he
could
tell
me
and
would
speak
for
him
he
and
his
family
are
very
proud
both
of
ancestry
and
position
within
limits
his
word
is
law
a
letter
from
him
is
better
than
any
government
passport
or
escort
through
the
nearly
inaccessible
fastnesses
of
the
ashirets
by
the
head
of
mar
shimun
and
by
the
house
of
mar
shimun
are
common
asseverations
but
he
and
his
are
exposed
constantly
to
indignities
and
insults
from
minor
turkish
officials
and
from
kurdish
chiefs
and
the
continual
disrespect
to
his
person
and
office
is
said
to
be
eating
into
his
soul
he
wears
a
crimson
with
a
black
a
short
blue
cloth
jacket
with
sleeves
wide
at
the
bottom
and
open
for
a
few
inches
at
the
inner
seam
blue
cloth
trousers
of
a
sailor
cut
a
red
and
white
striped
satin
shirt
the
front
and
sleeves
of
which
are
very
much
and
a
crimson
girdle
but
without
the
universal
this
is
the
man
who
is
the
head
at
once
of
a
church
and
nation
the
temporal
and
spiritual
ruler
of
the
syrian
people
the
hereditary
patriarch
the
of
the
east
whose
dynastic
ancestors
ranked
as
sixth
in
dignity
in
the
catholic
church
in
its
early
ages
it
was
not
however
till
the
early
part
of
the
fifth
century
when
the
church
of
the
east
threw
in
her
lot
with
nestorius
after
his
condemnation
in
by
the
council
of
ephesus
for
heretical
views
on
the
nature
of
our
lord
that
the
of
the
east
assumed
the
farther
title
of
patriarch
as
i
look
on
mar
shimun
irresolute
face
and
see
the
homage
which
his
people
pay
to
him
i
recall
the
history
of
a
day
when
this
church
which
only
survives
as
an
obscure
and
hunted
remnant
planted
churches
and
bishoprics
in
persia
central
asia
tartary
and
china
its
missionaries
full
of
zeal
and
brought
such
legions
into
its
fold
that
in
the
sixth
century
the
ecclesiastical
ancestor
of
this
patriarch
then
resident
at
baghdad
ruled
over
metropolitical
provinces
extending
from
jerusalem
to
china
and
when
in
the
fourteenth
century
it
was
not
only
the
largest
communion
in
christendom
but
outnumbered
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
christendom
east
and
west
roman
greek
and
other
churches
put
together
it
is
truly
a
marvel
not
only
that
baghdad
edessa
and
nisibis
possessed
nestorian
schools
of
divinity
and
philosophy
but
that
christian
colleges
seminaries
and
theological
schools
flourished
in
samarcand
bokhara
and
khiva
how
this
huge
church
melted
away
like
snow
and
how
the
tide
of
christianity
ebbed
leaving
as
a
relic
on
its
mark
within
the
chinese
frontier
a
stone
tablet
inscribed
with
the
nestorian
creed
and
how
taimurlane
pursued
the
unfortunate
christian
remnant
with
such
fury
that
the
himself
with
a
fugitive
band
was
forced
to
fly
into
these
mountains
are
matters
of
most
singular
historic
interest
most
fascinating
indeed
is
it
to
be
here
each
day
seems
but
an
hour
so
absorbing
are
the
interests
so
deep
the
pathos
so
vivid
the
tableaux
so
unique
the
life
in
this
hamlet
of
kochanes
on
its
fair
green
alp
at
a
height
of
feet
among
these
wild
mountains
of
kurdistan
musical
with
the
sound
of
torrents
fed
by
fifty
dashing
down
to
join
the
pison
the
river
of
eden
as
the
patriarch
calls
the
zab
on
its
way
to
the
classic
tigris
the
afternoon
i
arrived
sulti
marta
asiat
and
several
other
women
courteously
visited
me
and
the
next
day
i
returned
their
visits
in
their
simple
pleasant
houses
these
formalities
over
i
have
enjoyed
complete
liberty
and
have
acquainted
myself
with
the
whole
of
kochanes
and
with
many
of
the
people
and
their
interests
and
have
had
small
gatherings
of
men
in
my
room
each
evening
or
browne
interpreting
their
tales
of
strife
or
wrong
fear
is
on
every
side
the
fear
of
a
people
practically
unarmed
for
their
long
guns
some
of
them
matchlocks
are
of
no
use
against
the
rifles
of
the
kurds
dare
they
fire
in
travelling
is
nearly
suspended
a
company
of
people
whose
needs
call
them
to
urmi
dare
not
run
the
risk
of
the
journey
till
they
can
go
down
with
mar
gauriel
and
his
large
escort
it
is
evident
that
the
patriarch
and
his
people
hoped
for
a
british
protectorate
as
one
result
of
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
mission
and
that
they
are
bitterly
disappointed
that
their
condition
is
growing
worse
how
can
we
listen
to
teaching
say
some
of
them
when
we
have
no
rest
how
can
we
believe
in
god
when
he
lets
these
things
happen
to
us
the
almighty
is
deaf
and
we
cease
to
pray
can
we
hear
teaching
when
the
wolf
is
on
us
by
night
and
day
if
we
let
go
the
cross
we
might
be
rich
and
safe
night
by
night
we
ask
we
see
the
morning
for
our
oppressors

fiercer
daily
mar
bishop
of
mentioned
previously
as
a
fugitive
from
his
diocese
is
a
fine
man
more
like
a
sailor
than
an
ecclesiastic
late
one
night
in
a
whisper
with
a
trusty
watch
at
the
door
he
told
his
story
through
in
the
following
words
i
fled
fearing
for
my
life
because
many
times
i
had
spoken
against
the
oppressions
the
kurds
have
carried
away
most
of
the
sheep
and
goats
besides
taking
all
they
wished
to
have
and
they
entered
through
the
houses
plundering
everything
and
burning
two
in
their
words
are
or
die
i
petitioned
government
regarding
the
oppressions
and
mohammed
bey
came
and
by
threat
of
death
he
got
my
seal
and
wrote
in
my
name
a
letter
saying
it
was
all
false
there
were
no
oppressions
and
he
was
a
very
good
man
and
he
signed
it
with
my
seal
and
it
went
to
stamboul
my
seal
has
now
been
for
one
year
in
the
hands
of
mohammed
bey
who
has
killed
about
thirty
christians
in
berwar
three
months
ago
i
fled
to
save
my
life
seventeen
years
the
oppressions
have
begun
but
it
was
ten
years
ago
when
we
could
easily
keep
ourselves
and
raise
our
bread
now
we
can
not
in
five
years
ago
all
had
plenty
of
dress
and
bread
and
every
family
kept
two
cows
and
two
hundred
or
more
of
sheep
but
now
when
i
visited
them
i
would
shame
to
look
at
the
female
persons
so
naked
were
they
and
so
did
they
hide
themselves
for
shame
in
the
dark
parts
of
their
houses
for
their
dress
was
all
in
pieces
so
that
their
flesh
was
seen
i
was
thirsty
and
asked
for
milk
and
they
made
reply
we
have
not
a
cow
or
a
sheep
or
a
goat
we
forget
the
taste
of
milk
and
most
of
their
fine
fields
were
gone
out
of
their
hands
by
oppressions
for
they
could
no
longer
find
money
wherewith
to
pay
taxes
and
they
sold
them
for
a
vile
price
k
was
the
best
village
in
sopana
and
more
wealthy
than
any
village
of
kurds
or
christians
there
i
went
and
asked
for
some
milk
they
said
a
goat
or
a
sheep
or
a
cow
have
we
i
ask
of
all
the
families
their
condition
and
they
make
reply
with
many
tears
that
we
have
has
left
our
hands
and
we
fear
for
our
lives
now
we
were
rich
now
we
have
not
bread
to
eat
from
day
to
day
seventeen
years
ago
the
village
of
b
had
fifty
families
of
wealthy
villagers
but
now
i
only
find
twelve
and
those
twelve
could
scarcely
find
bread
i
had
asked
bread
but
i
could
not
find
it
by
day
their
things
were
taken
by
force
out
of
their
houses
at
night
their
sheep
and
cattle
were
driven
off
they
could
keep
nothing
our
wheat
our
sheep
our
butter
is
not
our
own
the
chief
mohammed
bey
and
his
servants
ask
of
us
saying
or
we
will
kill
you
this
is
a
sample
of
innumerable
tales
to
which
i
listen
daily
some
are
probably
grossly
exaggerated
others
and
this
among
them
are
probably
true
in
all
essential
particulars
daily
from
all
quarters
men
arrive
with
their
complaints
of
robbery
and
violence
and
ask
the
patriarch
to
obtain
redress
for
them
but
he
is
powerless
illustration

face
vol
my
favourite
walk
is
down
the
fair
green
lawn
outside
the
village
on
which
is
a
copse
of
poplars
with
foliage
of
reddening
gold
beside
it
on
the
verge
of
the
precipitous
heights
above
the
terpai
is
a
bold
group
of
rocks
on
which
the
church
dedicated
to
mar
shalita
is
built
the
ruins
of
a
former
church
dedicated
to
mart
mariam
are
higher
up
the
alp
below
the
rocks
are
a
great
number
of
tombstones
with
incised
ornaments
upon
them
bearing
the
general
name
of
crosses
the
church
has
nothing
specially
ecclesiastical
in
its
appearance
it
has
some
resemblance
to
a
keep
with
and
its
irregular
form
seems
to
have
been
dictated
by
the
configuration
of
the
rock
it
has
no
windows
and
the
cruciform
slits
at
a
great
height
look
like
loopholes
it
is
indeed
the
ultimate
refuge
of
the
patriarch
and
the
villagers
in
case
of
a
descent
of
the
kurds
i
walked
all
round
it
through
the
poplar
grove
with
its
mirthful
waters
among
the
tombs
and
back
by
the
edge
of
the
ravine
to
the
west
side
without
finding
a
door
in
truth
the
only
entrance
is
up
a
rude
and
very
steep
ladder
about
ten
feet
high
with
a
rude
door
at
the
top
six
inches
thick
but
only
three
feet
high
how
old
and
infirm
people
get
up
and
down
i
can
not
tell
so
difficult
is
the
access
that
i
was
glad
to
avail
myself
of
the
vigorous
aid
of
mar
gauriel
who
having
visited
england
is
ready
on
all
occasions
with
courteous
attentions
to
a
lady
the
reason
of
the
low
doors
is
said
to
be
that
all
may
bow
their
heads
on
entering
the
house
of
god
and
that
the
moslems
may
not
stable
their
cattle
in
the
church
the
entrance
harmonises
with
the
obvious
pervading
motive
of
the
design
which
is
illustration
syrian
cross
the
door
opens
into
a
small
courtyard
partly
protected
by
a
wooden
roof
at
its
farther
end
in
a
recess
in
its
massive
wall
is
a
small
altar
its
west
wall
is
pierced
so
that
the
approach
can
be
commanded
in
this
courtyard
the
daily
prayers
are
frequently
said
during
the
warm
weather
a
few
steps
lead
from
this
into
a
building
of
two
stories
a
rude
little
house
in
fact
once
occupied
by
one
of
the
patriarchs
and
latterly
by
the
late
rabban
yonan
a
holy
man
almost
a
hermit
whose
reputation
for
sanctity
has
extended
far
beyond
the
limits
of
kurdistan
removing
our
shoes
we
entered
the
church
through
a
sort
of
porch
the
lintel
of
which
is
ornamented
with
consisting
of
a
cross
in
and
side
ornaments
of
the
same
very
rudely
executed
the
threshold
is
elevated
and
the
lintel
of
the
door
only
three
feet
four
inches
high
so
that
the
worshipper
must
bend
again
before
entering
it
was
a
gloomy
transition
from
the
bright
october
sunshine
to
the
dark
twilight
within
and
even
with
the
aid
of
candles
the
interior
was
only
dimly
seen
it
consists
of
a
nave
about
feet
long
with
a
sanctuary
and
a
sacristy
which
also
serves
as
the
baptistery
at
the
east
end
the
nave
is
lofty
and
without
seats
the
worshippers
stand
during
divine
service
even
the
aged
and
infirm
only
rest
by
leaning
on
their
staffs
in
the
nave
below
the
screen
of
the
sanctuary
are
three
altars
on
one
the
altar
of
prayers
the
anthem
books
are
laid
on
another
the
altar
of
the
gospels
is
a
copy
of
the
gospels
wrapped
in
a
cloth
on
which
is
a
cross
which
it
is
customary
to
kiss
on
the
third
there
is
also
a
cross
a
very
thick
wall
separates
the
nave
from
the
eastern
chamber
which
in
its
turn
is
divided
unequally
into
two
parts
this
wall
is
pierced
by
a
narrow
chancel
arch
and
there
is
a
narrow
platform
behind
the
altars
of
prayer
ascended
by
three
steps
at
which
the
people
receive
the
eucharistic
elements
through
the
arch
is
dimly
seen
the
altar
over
which
is
a
stone
canopy
or
supported
on
four
pillars
in
the
sacristy
is
a
narrow
but
deep
font
in
which
the
infant
is
baptized
by
being
dipped
in
the
water
up
to
the
knees
at
the
name
of
the
father
up
to
the
waist
at
the
name
of
the
son
and
wholly
immersed
at
the
name
of
the
holy
ghost
the
priest
repeating
thou
art
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
father
amen
and
of
the
son
amen
and
of
the
holy
ghost
amen
before
the
rite
the
infant
forehead
is
anointed
with
oil
in
the
church
and
it
is
completely
anointed
in
the
baptistery
before
being
plunged
into
the
font
every
infant
has
two
who
act
as
sponsors
at
its
subsequent
marriage
these
persons
by
undertaking
this
office
are
placed
in
a
relationship
of
affinity
close
enough
to
be
a
bar
to
marriage
after
the
baptism
the
child
is
confirmed
in
the
nave
with
oil
and
the
imposition
of
the
priest
hands
and
after
being
very
tightly
bound
up
in
its
swaddling
clothes
is
handed
to
the
infant
communion
is
the
rule
of
the
church
but
the
elements
are
rarely
received
at
the
time
of
baptism
baptism
is
only
valid
when
celebrated
by
a
priest
and
in
a
consecrated
church
private
baptisms
are
unlawful
but
there
is
a
form
of
prayer
appointed
for
use
if
a
child
is
dangerously
ill
during
which
the
priest
signs
a
basin
of
water
with
the
sign
of
the
cross
saying
in
the
strength
of
our
lord
may
this
water
be
of
blessing
in
the
name
etc
the
mother
afterwards
bathes
the
child
in
the
water
and
if
it
dies
they
trust
it
to
the
mercy
of
god
if
it
recovers
it
must
be
taken
to
church
to
be
baptized
in
the
usual
manner
the
holy
communion
the
ought
by
rule
to
precede
baptism
in
the
very
early
morning
and
the
baptismal
rite
ought
to
be
administered
on
the
eighth
day
but
it
is
often
postponed
till
the
annual
village
festival
at
which
the
is
always
celebrated
the
whole
interior
of
the
church
of
kochanes
is
covered
by
a
plain
vaulted
stone
roof
at
the
west
end
of
the
nave
is
a
row
of
oblong
stone
tombs
four
feet
high
in
which
several
of
the
patriarchs
are
buried
and
a
steep
narrow
stone
stair
leads
from
these
to
a
small
door
high
up
in
the
north
wall
which
gives
access
to
a
small
chamber
in
which
the
priest
prepares
and
bakes
the
bread
for
the
holy
communion
the
flour
for
this
purpose
is
preferably
of
wheat
which
has
been
gleaned
by
girls
it
is
ground
in
a
and
is
mixed
with
holy
leaven
handed
on
from
sacrament
to
sacrament
the
bread
is
made
into
round
cakes
a
quarter
of
an
inch
thick
and
two
and
a
half
inches
in
diameter
which
are
stamped
with
a
cross
great
importance
is
attached
to
the
elements
and
the
water
used
for
mixing
with
the
sacramental
wine
is
always
brought
from
the
purest
spring
within
reach
on
one
side
of
this
upper
chamber
at
a
height
of
four
feet
there
is
the
mouth
of
a
sort
of
tunnel
which
runs
between
the
flat
exterior
roof
and
the
vaulted
ceiling
of
the
nave
this
is
used
for
concealing
the
liturgies
and
the
other
poor
valuables
of
the
church
in
times
of
peril
secret
as
this
is
the
kurds
discovered
it
some
years
ago
and
carried
off
and
destroyed
whatever
of
value
had
been
hidden
including
a
and
a
knife
which
it
is
said
were
given
by
mohammed
to
a
former
and
which
are
now
in
stamboul
the
general
arrangement
of
the
church
is
a
pathetic
protest
against
chronic
insecurity
and
persecution
the
interior
and
especially
the
sanctuary
are
as
black
as
smoke
can
make
them
although
very
few
candles
are
ordinarily
used
the
clergy
holding
rolls
of
thin
wax
taper
in
their
hands
when
they
require
light
on
the
liturgies
and
gospel
there
is
little
architectural
ornament
except
some
sculptured
stones
and
two
recesses
with
roofs
at
the
sides
of
the
chancel
arch
the
church
is
in
good
repair
for
if
any
rain
gets
into
a
sacred
building
it
has
to
be
reconsecrated
towards
five
the
is
beaten
and
the
patriarch
the
two
bishops
and
some
other
men
all
in
secular
dress
saunter
down
to
evening
prayers
which
are
usually
said
by
the
patriarch
himself
and
consist
of
a
few
prayers
a
short
lesson
and
some
psalms
the
custom
is
for
the
people
on
entering
to
kiss
the
cross
the
gospels
and
the
patriarch
hand
and
to
lay
their
daggers
in
the
church
porch
clerical
vestments
are
not
worn
at
these
services
the
liturgies
and
gospels
are
magnificent
specimens
of
caligraphy
and
the
syriac
characters
are
in
themselves
beautiful
it
is
appointed
that
the
whole
psalter
be
recited
in
three
days
and
though
i
imagine
that
some
abridgment
is
made
the
priests
and
people
contrary
to
rule
are
apt
to
sit
on
the
floor
during
the
antiphonal
singing
of
the
psalms
owing
to
their
extreme
length
the
chanting
is
very
discordant
as
each
man
adopts
the
key
which
suits
himself
the
kiss
of
peace
is
an
interesting
and
decorous
feature
of
the
daily
worship
and
is
always
given
at
the
beginning
even
if
it
should
be
omitted
at
the
close
on
entering
the
church
the
priest
crosses
himself
and
kisses
the
cross
which
always
lies
on
the
altar
on
the
north
side
saying
glory
be
to
god
in
the
highest
after
this
the
people
come
forward
and
kiss
first
the
cross
and
then
the
hand
and
each
passing
on
touches
the
hands
of
those
who
before
him
have
kissed
the
sacred
emblem
and
raises
his
own
hand
to
his
lips
it
is
the
custom
always
to
kiss
the
hand
of
a
bishop
or
priest
on
meeting
him
in
the
road
or
elsewhere
and
the
salutation
is
performed
in
a
reverential
manner
the
church
furniture
and
vestments
show
the
great
poverty
of
the
people
the
altar
cloth
is
figured
white
cotton
two
tarnished
and
battered
candlesticks
stand
on
the
altar
and
a
very
sordid
cross
in
the
recess
behind
it
the
chalice
is
a
silver
bowl
tarnished
almost
blackened
by
neglect
and
the
paten
is
a
silver
tray
in
the
same
state
there
are
a
bronze
censer
an
antique
with
embossed
scripture
figures
upon
it
and
a
branched
surmounted
by
a
bird
both
of
the
rudest
construction
and
greatly
neglected
dust
and
cobwebs
of
ancient
date
droppings
from
candles
and
bits
of
candle
wicks
offend
western
eyes
in
the
sacristy
and
elsewhere
the
clerical
dress
is
very
simple
and
of
the
poorest
materials
the
priest
wears
an
alb
a
girdle
and
a
stole
crossed
over
the
breast
and
at
the
a
calico
square
with
crosses
in
coloured
cotton
sewn
upon
it
thrown
over
the
shoulders
and
raised
at
times
to
cover
the
head
or
to
form
a
screen
between
him
and
the
congregation
the
deacon
wears
an
alb
or
church
shirt
with
coloured
cotton
crosses
on
the
breast
and
back
a
blue
and
white
girdle
and
a
stole
which
is
crossed
over
the
right
shoulder
and
has
its
ends
tucked
into
the
girdle
the
only
difference
in
the
dress
of
a
bishop
is
that
he
wears
a
stole
reaching
to
the
ankles
and
not
crossed
upon
the
breast
the
ordinary
attire
of
the
clergy
and
laity
is
the
same
and
the
same
similarity
pervades
their
occupations
even
bishops
may
be
seen
hard
at
work
in
the
fields
the
sanctuary
is
held
in
great
reverence
and
mar
gauriel
who
is
more
like
a
jolly
sailor
than
a
priest
put
on
a
girdle
and
stole
before
entering
it
when
he
showed
it
to
me
strange
to
say
the
priests
and
deacons
officiating
at
the
holy
communion
retain
their
shoes
and
remove
their
turbans
the
graves
round
the
church
are
very
numerous
and
are
neatly
kept
one
burial
has
taken
place
since
i
came
the
corpse
that
of
a
stranger
was
enclosed
in
a
rough
wooden
coffin
and
the
blowing
of
horns
beating
of
drums
carrying
of
branches
decorated
with
handkerchiefs
and
apples
and
the
wailing
of
the
women
and
other
demonstrations
of
grief
such
as
men
jumping
into
the
grave
beating
their
breasts
and
uttering
cries
of
anguish
distressing
scenes
which
are
usual
at
syrian
funerals
were
consequently
absent
the
burial
service
is
very
striking
and
dramatic
and
there
are
different
orders
for
bishops
priests
deacons
laymen
women
and
children
the
whole
if
recited
at
full
length
takes
fully
five
hours
besides
prayers
innumerable
both
for
the
departed
and
the
survivors
there
are
various
dialogues
between
the
mourners
and
the
departed
and
between
the
departed
and
the
souls
of
those
already
in
hades
in
spite
of
the
perils
around
marrying
and
giving
in
marriage
go
on
much
as
usual
mar
gauriel
bishop
of
urmi
has
come
up
on
nothing
less
important
than
a
matrimonial
errand
to
ask
for
the
hand
of
the
patriarch
niece
a
small
child
of
eight
years
old
the
daughter
of
ishai
and
asiat
for
his
nephew
a
boy
of
fourteen
girls
may
marry
at
twelve
and
the
beautiful
asiat
the
child
mother
is
only
twenty
i
was
invited
to
tea
when
the
proposals
were
made
in
a
neutral
house
where
browne
interpreted
the
proceedings
for
me
mar
gauriel
handsomely
dressed
in
red
with
a
or
coat
of
honour
given
him
by
the
shah
over
his
usual
clothes
looked
as
blithe
and
handsome
as
a
suitor
should
he
sat
on
one
side
of
the
floor
with
a
friend
to
help
his
suit
and
on
the
other
were
seated
sulti
asiat
and
the
child
conversation
was
general
for
a
time
then
the
bishop
with
a
change
of
face
which
meant
business
produced
a
small
parcel
and
laid
on
the
floor
with
a
deliberate
pause
between
the
articles
carbuncle
and
diamond
rings
pins
gold
bracelets
a
very
fine
pink
coral
necklace
with
a
gold
and
turquoise
pendant
and
finally
a
long
chain
of
hollow
balls
of
massive
filigree
silver
beautiful
enough
to
fetch
any
woman
the
mother
and
aunt
sat
rigidly
assumed
stony
faces
and
would
not
admire
but
mar
gauriel
had
other
weapons
in
his
armoury
and
produced
from
a
large
bundle
articles
of
dress
of
full
size
among
which
were
constantinople
gauze
gowns
sprigged
with
gold
a
green
silk
gown
covered
with
embroidery
and
lastly
a
sort
of
coat
of
very
rich
cloth
of
gold
a
costly
thing
the
child
eyes
sparkled
at
this
the
bishop
looked
up
from
it
at
the
two
women
but
a
look
of
contempt
alone
flitted
across
their
stony
faces
then
he
began
his
plea
which
was
loud
and
eloquent
he
said
he
could
get
a
hundred
brides
for
his
nephew
who
would
be
good
workers
but
the
daughter
of
asiat
should
be
a
princess
and
have
servants
to
wait
upon
her
and
have
nothing
to
do
he
said
he
would
wait
four
years
for
her
he
only
wanted
a
promise
he
was
not
tactful
he
set
forth
the
advantages
of
an
alliance
with
himself
too
strongly
for
a
suitor
the
house
of
mar
shimun
is
very
proud
and
its
connection
is
courted
by
all
and
the
ladies
were
obdurate
and
literally
frowned
on
his
plea
looking
with
contempt
upon
the
glittering
display
on
the
floor
two
days
later
the
patriarch
himself
rejected
mar
suit
saying
it
would
be
a
shame
for
the
house
of
mar
shimun
it
would
be
a
shameful
example
to
betroth
so
young
a
girl
there
the
matter
must
rest
for
a
time
at
least
an
actual
marriage
is
arranged
and
this
time
the
bride
sanjani
is
a
handsome
and
very
attractive
girl
of
fourteen
years
old
with
a
strong
will
and
individuality
she
has
been
several
times
to
see
me
and
i
have
become
quite
interested
in
her
yesterday
a
number
of
men
were
seen
descending
the
dizzy
zigzags
which
lead
from
jelu
down
the
mountain
on
the
other
side
of
the
terpai
ravine
and
later
after
a
few
shots
had
been
fired
a
party
of
jelu
mountaineers
superbly
dressed
came
up
into
kochanes
also
on
a
matrimonial
errand
some
of
these
men
are
quite
blond
they
came
on
behalf
of
a
youth
of
high
position
in
jelu
and
the
bargaining
was
keen
for
the
girl
is
of
the
house
of
mar
shimun
eventually
they
gave
twenty
a
mule
a
gun
thirty
sheep
and
a
revolver
for
her
as
well
as
presents
to
the
negotiators
she
wept
most
bitterly
at
the
prospect
of
leaving
kochanes
the
money
is
spent
on
the
and
the
parents
give
a
present
to
the
bridegroom
shortly
after
the
betrothal
mar
sergis
bishop
of
jelu
arrived
with
fifty
jelu
men
the
young
bridegroom
and
some
matrons
the
bishop
who
is
a
man
was
dressed
in
a
robe
red
and
a
turban
the
other
men
were
in
silks
and
gold
embroideries
and
carried
jewelled
revolvers
and
long
guns
with
the
stocks
curiously
inlaid
with
ivory
and
silver
as
they
climbed
up
through
the
bushes
of
the
ravine
they
simulated
an
attack
by
skirmishers
firing
guns
and
revolvers
a
few
kochanes
men
fired
as
if
in
defence
but
most
of
the
people
decided
not
to
show
this
sign
of
joy
because
news
had
come
that
the
kurds
had
driven
off
the
sheep
of
the
father
of
asiat
so
with
this
feint
of
attack
and
capture
the
brilliant
throng
reached
the
top
of
the
ascent
mar
sergis
and
others
riding
mules
musicians
playing
a
drum
and
flageolets
and
five
or
six
men
with
drawn
swords
in
their
right
hands
and
leather
shields
on
their
left
arms
escorting
the
bridegroom
to
the
hospitalities
of
the
house
the
roofs
were
crowded
with
villagers
but
the
bride
was
hidden
in
her
father
house
the
father
had
beaten
her
on
her
head
with
a
long
wooden
spoon
and
she
was
lying
down
on
that
and
the
two
following
evenings
there
was
dancing
in
the
house
late
into
the
night
and
the
days
were
spent
in
feasting
and
masquerading
it
is
regarded
as
a
very
good
marriage
for
sanjani
the
marriage
ceremony
which
is
private
was
performed
in
the
church
at
sunrise
on
the
fourth
day
there
were
present
mar
sergis
the
bridegroom
uncle
the
bridegroom
the
bridegroom
friend
and
sanjani
and
her
mother
who
were
preceded
to
the
church
by
a
fifer
the
marriage
service
which
took
half
an
hour
was
performed
at
the
west
end
of
the
nave
at
the
conclusion
wine
and
water
but
not
as
a
eucharistic
symbol
mixed
with
a
little
earth
from
the
church
precincts
were
administered
to
the
married
couple
the
ring
is
used
as
with
us
the
most
curious
part
of
the
ceremony
is
that
while
the
service
or
blessing
as
it
is
called
is
proceeding
the
groomsman
holds
up
a
light
wooden
frame
to
which
fruits
are
attached
this
is
also
hung
over
the
bridegroom
head
at
the
house
and
is
carried
with
him
when
he
goes
out
to
dance
it
is
broken
on
the
last
day
of
the
feasting
and
the
pair
and
their
friends
eat
the
fruit
the
festivities
were
prolonged
for
three
days
more
after
which
the
bride
with
music
and
firing
of
guns
was
taken
away
in
charge
of
the
matrons
to
her
husband
house
in
jelu
where
there
were
to
be
rejoicings
and
feastings
for
other
seven
days
as
the
bride
procession
passes
the
bridegroom
attended
by
his
young
takes
his
place
on
a
roof
with
a
store
of
apples
beside
him
which
after
signing
himself
with
the
cross
he
throws
among
the
crowd
the
hitting
of
the
bride
being
regarded
as
a
sign
of
good
luck
bishops
are
not
allowed
to
marry
but
to
priests
after
their
ordination
both
first
and
second
marriages
are
permitted
the
law
of
divorce
is
very
lax
even
according
to
the
church
canons
and
canon
maclean
says
that
the
practice
is
very
bad
and
that
it
is
a
great
temptation
to
the
bishops
several
of
whom
are
very
poor
to
grant
divorces
for
the
sake
of
the
fees
friday
was
a
severe
fast
in
the
patriarch
household
as
in
all
others
the
fasts
of
the
syrian
church
it
has
been
said
can
only
be
described
as
prodigious
a
syrian
fast
means
serious
for
it
involves
not
only
abstinence
from
meat
but
from
fish
honey
eggs
milk
butter
cheese
and
all
animal
products
and
the
syrian
eats
nothing
but
rice
cooked
in
walnut
oil
raisins
walnuts
treacle
beans
plain
potatoes
and
bread
all
wednesdays
and
fridays
in
the
year
this
strict
is
adhered
to
and
the
members
of
the
old
church
also
fast
for
fifty
days
in
lent
and
in
advent
and
keep
the
very
severe
three
days
fast
of
the
ninevites
most
adults
keep
also
the
fast
of
mary
the
first
fourteen
days
of
august
no
religious
observance
is
more
rigidly
adhered
to
by
the
nation
than
these
severe
and
prolonged
abstinences
and
it
is
difficult
for
the
syrians
to
believe
in
the
piety
of
any
who
do
not
by
the
same
methods
mortify
the
body
and
bring
it
into
subjection
mar
auraham
son
of
marta
a
man
of
and
a
bishop
without
a
diocese
has
returned
and
spent
part
of
yesterday
evening
in
my
room
he
looks
delicate
but
has
a
bright
intelligent
charming
face
and
his
conversation
was
thoughtful
and
interesting
he
really
cares
about
his
church
and
its
discipline
is
regarded
as
honourable
and
straightforward
in
a
marked
degree
and
as
preferring
the
spiritual
to
the
temporal
interests
of
his
nation
he
is
apparently
a
warm
friend
of
the
english
mission
and
if
he
should
succeed
to
the
chair
of
mar
shimun
great
progress
might
be
expected
but
intrigues
are
surging
round
him
and
the
patriarchal
family
is
not
without
its
ambitions
to
which
he
may
possibly
be
sacrificed
the
succession
to
the
patriarchate
and
episcopate
is
the
subject
of
a
peculiar
arrangement
which
makes
these
offices
practically
hereditary
in
the
mar
shimun
family
there
has
been
provided
for
more
than
three
centuries
a
regular
succession
of
youths
called
who
have
never
eaten
meat
or
married
and
whose
mothers
ate
no
meat
for
many
months
before
they
were
born
one
of
these
is
chosen
by
the
patriarch
as
his
successor
and
then
some
of
the
disappointed
youths
take
to
eating
meat
like
other
men
at
the
present
time
though
mar
auraham
has
been
designated
there
are
one
or
two
of
the
patriarch
who
are
being
brought
up
not
to
eat
meat
the
same
prohibition
applies
to
a
bishop
he
also
usually
has
one
or
more
frequently
nephews
or
cousins
who
have
been
brought
up
by
him
not
to
eat
meat
one
of
whom
if
there
be
more
than
one
he
chooses
as
his
successor
if
he
neglects
to
make
a
choice
the
bishopric
at
his
death
falls
like
a
fief
to
the
patriarch
who
has
an
enormous
diocese
while
three
of
the
bishops
have
only
a
few
villages
to
look
after
bishops
priests
and
deacons
are
very
poor
occasionally
a
church
has
a
field
or
two
as
an
endowment
or
the
villagers
contribute
a
small
sum
annually
or
plough
the
priest
fields
or
shear
his
sheep
but
the
fees
given
for
baptisms
marriages
and
other
occasional
offices
would
be
his
sole
dependence
unless
he
followed
some
secular
calling
in
some
places
there
is
a
plethora
of
supernumerary
priests
and
it
is
shrewdly
said
that
these
obtain
holy
orders
from
the
bishops
for
the
sake
of
the
loaves
of
sugar
paid
as
fees
there
are
great
abuses
connected
with
ordination
one
of
the
present
bishops
was
consecrated
when
quite
a
young
boy
and
deacons
are
often
ordained
at
sixteen
and
even
much
earlier
mar
auraham
must
have
been
consecrated
before
he
was
twenty
the
only
qualification
for
ordination
is
the
ability
to
read
old
syriac
the
and
young
mountaineers
whom
i
have
seen
as
representing
the
diaconate
look
far
more
like
bandits
than
deacons
in
one
large
village
there
are
at
present
fifty
deacons
and
fifteen
priests
attached
to
one
church
illustration
syrian
priest
and
wife
the
can
not
be
celebrated
without
the
assistance
of
a
deacon
it
is
almost
entirely
confined
to
the
great
festivals
and
the
feast
of
the
patron
saint
of
each
village
after
the
making
of
the
bread
with
the
holy
leaven
and
certain
preliminaries
by
the
clergy
the
congregation
comes
into
church
summoned
by
blows
on
the
wooden
the
men
stand
in
front
the
women
behind
all
taking
off
their
shoes
and
kissing
the
cross
when
the
elements
are
to
be
received
the
priest
advances
to
the
door
of
the
sanctuary
and
a
deacon
completely
enveloped
by
the
curtain
before
the
entrance
holds
the
paten
while
the
priest
gives
the
bread
to
the
men
first
then
to
the
women
and
to
the
little
children
held
up
either
by
father
or
mother
the
adults
receive
the
cup
in
order
from
the
deacon
who
passes
it
through
a
hole
in
a
wall
about
six
feet
high
which
runs
parallel
with
the
wall
of
the
sanctuary
but
at
a
little
distance
from
it
on
leaving
the
church
after
communion
each
person
takes
a
piece
of
ordinary
bread
from
a
tray
near
the
door
the
priests
and
deacons
communicate
after
the
people
when
the
sanctuary
veil
has
again
been
drawn
the
eucharist
is
always
celebrated
at
or
before
daybreak
except
in
the
case
of
certain
fast
days
and
at
funerals
when
it
is
considered
a
devotional
act
to
fast
till
during
parts
of
the
communion
service
one
deacon
swings
a
censer
and
another
clangs
a
cymbal
the
as
celebrated
in
the
syrian
villages
reminds
me
both
of
the
great
communion
gatherings
of
the
scottish
highlands
and
the
church
service
which
in
my
childhood
ushered
in
the
revelry
of
the
village
wake
or
feast
the
festivals
which
as
in
england
fall
on
the
feast
of
the
patron
saint
of
the
village
are
the
great
gaieties
of
syrian
life
and
even
the
kurd
can
not
altogether
overshadow
them
after
the
celebration
of
the
at
dawn
when
the
crowds
are
frequently
so
great
that
the
church
is
filled
by
several
successive
congregations
of
communicants
the
day
is
spent
in
visiting
and
in
every
house
fruit
sweetmeats
and
tea
are
provided
for
all
comers
and
if
it
be
obtainable
forms
a
part
of
the
entertainment
dances
and
games
are
kept
up
all
day
and
at
its
close
many
are
drunk
and
disorderly
these
are
the
occasions
when
fighting
with
the
moslems
is
apt
to
take
place
men
and
women
of
course
dance
separately
and
the
women
much
in
the
background
the
dancing
as
i
have
seen
it
is
slow
and
stately
a
number
of
either
sex
join
hands
in
a
ring
and
move
round
to
slow
music
at
times
letting
go
each
other
hands
for
the
purpose
of
gesticulation
and
waving
of
handkerchiefs
it
is
not
unlike
the
national
dance
of
the
bakhtiaris
the
women
not
only
keep
in
retirement
on
this
but
on
all
occasions
they
never
sit
at
meat
with
the
men
but
take
their
food
afterwards
in
private
indeed
i
strongly
suspect
that
they
eat
the
leavings
of
their
superiors
it
is
not
however
only
the
women
who
occupy
a
subordinate
position
young
men
treat
not
only
their
fathers
but
their
elder
brothers
with
extreme
respect
and
when
there
are
guests
at
table
the
sons
do
not
sit
down
with
the
fathers
but
wait
on
the
guests
and
take
their
own
meals
like
the
women
afterwards
the
syrians
call
easter
the
great
feast
and
christmas
the
little
feast
at
the
former
eggs
coloured
red
are
lavishly
bestowed
the
festival
of
the
epiphany
also
receives
great
honour
but
it
is
curious
that
a
people
who
believe
that
they
owe
their
christianity
to
the
wise
men
should
not
keep
this
feast
so
much
in
commemoration
of
them
as
of
our
lord
baptism
so
much
does
the
latter
view
preponderate
that
the
urmi
christians
call
it
by
a
name
which
means
the
new
waters
here
in
the
mountains
however
it
is
called
the
brightness
during
the
night
before
the
celebration
of
the
on
the
feast
of
the
epiphany
it
is
customary
to
plunge
into
frozen
pools
one
lord
one
faith
one
baptism
they
hold
with
us
and
it
is
of
great
interest
to
recognise
this
fact
in
the
midst
of
many
superstitions
and
even
puerilities
it
is
impossible
by
any
language
to
convey
an
idea
of
the
poverty
and
meanness
the
blackness
and
accumulations
of
dust
the
darkness
and
the
gloom
of
the
syrian
churches
of
which
this
one
is
a
favourable
specimen
typifying
i
fear
too
truly
the
gross
ignorance
indifference
and
superstition
in
which
bishops
priests
and
people
are
buried
and
yet
they
are
faithful
unto
death
my
daily
wonder
is
that
people
who
know
so
little
will
for
that
little
suffer
the
loss
of
all
things
apostasy
would
be
immediate
emancipation
from
terror
and
ruin
but
it
is
nearly
unknown
their
churches
are
like
the
catacombs
few
things
can
be
more
pathetic
than
a
congregation
standing
in
the
dark
and
dismal
nave
kissing
the
common
wooden
cross
and
passing
from
hand
to
hand
the
kiss
of
peace
while
the
priest
in
dress
like
their
own
with
girdle
and
stole
of
the
poorest
material
moves
among
the
ancient
liturgies
in
front
of
the
dusty
sanctuary
leading
the
worshippers
in
prayers
and
chants
which
have
come
down
from
the
earliest
ages
of
christianity
from
the
triumphant
church
of
the
east
to
the
persecuted
remnant
of
footnotes
for
the
correction
of
my
very
imperfect
investigations
into
the
religious
customs
of
the
syrians
i
am
indebted
to
a
very
careful
and
learned
paper
by
canon
maclean
account
of
the
customs
of
the
eastern
syrian
originally
published
in
the

now
to
be
obtained
at

of

a
singular
legend
is
told
regarding
the
origin
of
the
sacred
leaven
and
the
sacred
oil
the
syrians
say
that
as
our
lord
went
up
out
of
the
jordan
after
his
baptism
john
the
baptist
collected
in
a
phial
the
baptismal
water
as
it
dropped
from
his
sacred
person
giving
it
before
his
death
to
john
the
evangelist
at
the
last
supper
the
legend
runs
our
lord
gave
to
john
two
loaves
putting
it
into
his
heart
to
preserve
one
at
the
cross
when
this
same
apostle
saw
the
blood
and
water
he
took
the
phial
from
his
bosom
and
added
the
water
from
the
pierced
side
to
the
water
of
baptism
dipping
the
loaf
at
the
same
time
in
the
blood
after
the
day
of
pentecost
the
disciples
before
going
forth
to
disciple
the
nations
ground
john
loaf
to
powder
mixed
it
with
flour
and
salt
divided
it
among
themselves
and
carried
it
forth
to
serve
as
leaven
for
ever
for
the
bread
of
remembrance
in
like
manner
they
took
of
the
mingled
water
of
the
phial
and
mixing
it
with
oil
of
unction
divided
it
and
preserved
it
for
the
perpetual
sanctification
of
the
waters
of
baptism

has
invited

to

they
say
if
i
will
go
to
them
they
will
give
me
a
fine
suit
of

i
need
it
much
as
doubtless
they
have
observed

these
tyari
men
come
from
one
of

most
inaccessible

of

belong
to

and
their
priests
many
of
whom
can
not
even
read
are
sunk
in
the
grossest
ignorance
they
love
revenge
are
careless
of
human
life
and
are
wilder
and
more
savage
than
their
nominal
masters
it
is
among
these
people
who
purchase
their
freedom
at
the
cost
of
absolute
isolation
that
browne
is
going
to
spend
the
coming
winter
in
the
hope
of
instructing
their
priests
and
deacons
to
whom
at
present
guns
are
more
than
ordinances
he
has
been
among
them
already
and
has
won
their
illustration
a
syrian
girl
these
ashirets
of
whom
the
tyari
guests
are
specimens
are
quite
unlike
the
syrian
lowlanders
not
only
in
character
but
in
costume
and
habits
as
they
have
naturalised
numbers
of
kurdish
words
in
their
speech
so
their
dress
with
its
colour
rich
materials
and
embroideries
and
lavish
display
of
decorated
and
costly
arms
is
almost
altogether
kurdish
if
report
speaks
truly
their
fierce
tribal
feuds
and
readiness
with
the
dagger
are
kurdish
also
their
country
is
the
country
of
the
hunted
its
mountains
rise
nearly
perpendicularly
to
altitudes
of
over
feet
and
the
valleys
such
as
tyari
tkhoma
baz
diz
and
jelu
are
mere
slits
or
gashes
through
which
furious
tributaries
of
the
greater
zab
take
their
impetuous
course
above
these
streams
the
tribes
have
built
up
minute
fields
by
raising
the
lower
sides
on
stone
walls
a
few
feet
above
the
rivers
the
upper
being
the
steep
hill
slope
so
small
are
these
plots
that
it
is
said
that
the
harvest
of
some
of
them
would
only
fill
a
man
cap
occasionally
heavy
floods
sweep
away
the
rice
and
millet
cultivation
of
a
whole
district
and
the
mountaineers
are
compelled
to
depend
for
their
food
entirely
on
the
produce
of
their
flocks
if
they
could
sustain
themselves
and
their
animals
altogether
within
their
own
fastnesses
they
would
be
secure
from
molestation
either
from
kurds
or
turks
for
the
only
possible
entrances
to
their
valleys
are
so
narrow
and
ruggedly
steep
as
scarcely
to
be
accessible
for
a
and
ten
men
could
keep
any
number
at
bay
but
unfortunately
the
scanty
herbage
of
their
mountains
is
soon
exhausted
and
they
have
to
feed
their
flocks
outside
their
natural
fortifications
where
the
sheep
are
constantly
being
carried
off
by
the
kurds
who
murder
the
shepherds
and
women
the
mountaineers
are
quick
to
revenge
themselves
they
carry
off
kurdish
sheep
and
savage
warfare
and
a
life
under
arms
are
the
normal
condition
of
the
ashirets
the
worst
of
it
is
that
they
are
disunited
among
themselves
and
fight
and
spoil
each
other
as
much
as
they
fight
the
kurds
even
at
times
taking
part
with
them
against
their
christian
brethren
travellers
are
scarcely
safer
from
robbery
among
them
than
among
the
kurds
but
fierce
savage
and
quarrelsome
as
they
are
and
independent
both
of
turk
and
kurd
they
render
a
sort
of
obedience
to
mar
shimun
who
rules
them
through
their
there
is
not
only
enmity
between
tribe
and
tribe
but
between
village
and
village
and
as
in
parts
of
the
bakhtiari
country
guides
refuse
to
conduct
travellers
beyond
certain
spots
declaring
that
blood
bars
their
farther
progress
besides
the
kurdish
and
ashiret
inhabitants
of
these
mountains
of
kurdistan
there
are
yezidis
usually
called
and
a
few
jews
and
armenians
probably
there
is
not
a
wilder
population
on
the
face
of
the
earth
or
one
of
whose
ideas
real
beliefs
and
ways
europeans
are
so
ignorant
what
for
instance
do
we
really
know
of
the
beliefs
which
underlie
the
religious
customs
of
the
kizilbashes
and
yezidis
and
of
the
christianity
to
which
these
ashirets
are
so
passionately
attached
if
i
were
to
leave
browne
unnoticed
i
should
ignore
the
most
remarkable
character
in
kochanes
clothed
partly
as
a
syrian
and
living
altogether
like
one
at
this
time
speaking
syriac
more
readily
than
english
limited
to
this
narrow
alp
and
to
the
narrower
exile
of
the
tyari
valley
from
civilised
society
snowed
up
for
many
months
of
the
year
his
communications
even
with
van
and
urmi
irregular
and
precarious
a
priest
without
an
altar
a
teacher
without
pupils
a
hermit
without
privacy
his
time
at
the
disposal
of
every
one
who
cares
to
waste
it
harassed
by
turkish
officialism
and
obstruction
and
prohibited
by
the
porte
from
any
active
mission
work
it
yet
would
be
hard
to
find
a
sunnier
more
loving
and
more
buoyant
spirit
he
has
lived
among
these
people
for
nearly
four
years
as
one
of
themselves
making
their
interests
completely
his
own
suffering
keenly
in
their
persecutions
and
losses
and
entering
warmly
even
into
their
most
trivial
concerns
till
he
has
become
in
fact
a
syrian
among
syrians
he
sits
on
the
floor
in
native
fashion
his
primitive
and
unpalatable
food
served
in
copper
bowls
from
the
patriarch
kitchen
is
eaten
with
his
fingers
he
is
nearly
without
possessions
he
sleeps
on
the
floor
among
the
spiders
without
a
mattress
he
lives
in
a
hovel
up
a
steep
ladder
in
a
sort
of
tower
out
of
repair
syrian
customs
and
etiquette
have
become
second
nature
to
him
he
has
no
mission
work
to
report
he
is
himself
the
mission
and
the
work
the
hostility
of
the
turkish
government
and
the
insecurity
of
the
country
prevent
him
from
opening
schools
he
can
not
even
assemble
a
few
boys
and
teach
them
their
letters
he
got
a
bit
of
land
and
the
stones
for
erecting
a
cottage
but
is
not
allowed
to
build
his
plans
are
all
frustrated
by
bigotry
on
one
side
and
timidity
on
the
other
and
he
is
even
prevented
from
preaching
by
the
blind
conservatism
of
the
patriarchal
court
it
has
not
been
the
custom
to
have
preaching
at
kochanes
sermons
were
dangerous
things
that
promoted
heresy
the
patriarch
said
but
browne
is
far
from
being
idle
people
come
to
him
from
the
villages
and
surrounding
country
for
advice
and
often
take
it
they
confide
all
their
concerns
to
him
he
acts
effectively
the
part
of
a
peacemaker
in
their
quarrels
he
is
trusted
even
by
the
chiefs
and
priests
of
the
mountain
tribes
and
his
medical
skill
which
is
at
the
service
of
all
is
largely
resorted
to
at
all
hours
of
the
day
silenced
from
preaching
and
prohibited
from
teaching
far
better
than
a
sermon
is
his
own
cheery
life
of
unconscious
truth
purity
and
devotion
this
example
the
people
can
understand
though
they
can
not
see
why
an
englishman
should
voluntarily
take
to
such
a
life
as
he
leads
his
power
lies
in
his
singular
love
for
them
and
in
his
almost
complete
absorption
in
their
lives
and
interests
his
room
is
most
amusing
it
is
little
better
than
a
kerry
hovel
he
uses
neither
chair
table
nor
bed
the
uneven
earthen
floor
is
covered
with
such
a
litter
of
rubbish
as
is
to
be
seen
at
the
back
of
a
rag
and
bone
shop
dusty
medicine
bottles
predominating
there
is
a
general
dismemberment
of
everything
that
once
was
serviceable
the
occupant
of
the
room
is
absolutely
unconscious
of
its
demerits
and
my
ejaculations
of
dismay
are
received
with
hearty
laughter
humbly
following
his
example
i
have
become
absorbed
in
the
interests
of
the
inhabitants
of
kochanes
and
would
willingly
stay
here
for
some
weeks
longer
if
it
were
not
for
the
risk
of
being
blocked
in
by
snow
on
the
armenian
highlands
the
cattle
plague
is
very
severe
in
addition
to
other
misfortunes
the
village
has
already
lost
of
its
herd
and
i
seldom
go
out
without
seeing
men
dragging
carcasses
to
be
thrown
over
the
cliff
the
people
believe
that
the
men
will
die
next
year
my
future
journey
and
its
safety
are
much
discussed
if
i
had
had
any
idea
of
the
disturbed
state
of
the
region
that
i
have
yet
to
pass
through
i
should
never
have
entered
turkey
but
now
i
have
resolved
to
go
bitlis
to
erzerum
if
the
road
is
as
dangerous
as
it
is
said
to
be
and
if
the
rumours
regarding
the
state
of
the
christians
turn
out
to
have
much
truth
in
them
the
testimony
of
a
neutral
observer
may
be
useful
and
helpful
at
all
events
the
risk
is
worth
running
my
great
difficulty
is
that
must
leave
me
here
to
return
to
urmi
with
mar
gauriel
escort
and
that
i
have
no
competent
man
with
me
in
case
of
difficulty
mirza
not
only
does
not
speak
turkish
but
has
no
backbone
and
johannes
besides
having
the
disadvantage
of
being
an
armenian
is
really
half
a
savage
as
well
as
disobedient
reckless
and
quarrelsome
he
fought
with
a
turk
at
yekmala
and
got
me
into
trouble
and
one
of
his
first
misdemeanours
here
was
to
shoot
the
church
doves
which
are
regarded
as
sacred
thereby
giving
great
offence
to
the
patriarch
it
is
most
difficult
to
get
away
the
julamerik
muleteers
are
afraid
of
being
robbed
on
the
route
i
wish
to
take
and
none
of
them
but
a
young
kurd
will
undertake
my
loads
and
though
he
arrived
last
night
the
i
applied
for
have
failed
me
they
were
to
have
been
here
by
daylight
this
morning
and
the
loads
were
ready
but
nine
came
without
their
appearance
i
wanted
to
take
armed
men
from
kochanes
but
mar
shimun
said
that
twelve
christians
would
be
no
protection
against
the
kurds
and
that
i
must
not
go
without
a
government
escort
so
things
were
unpacked
late
this
evening
and
after
another
messenger
had
been
sent
to
julamerik
one
arrived
with
a
message
that
they
could
not
spare
more
and
the
people
protest
against
my
leaving
with
such
insufficient
protection
another
difficulty
is
the
want
of
money
owing
to
the
boom
in
silver
in
persia
and
the
which
prevailed
the
utmost
efforts
of
my
friends
in
urmi
could
only
obtain
for
a
note
and
this
only
in
silver
a
turkish
coin
worth
about
as
no
money
is
current
in
the
villages
change
can
not
be
procured
and
on
sending
to
julamerik
for
small
coins
only
a
very
limited
quantity
could
be
obtained
russian
locally
current
at
half
their
value
turkish
coins
the
size
of
a
crown
piece
but
so
debased
that
they
are
only
worth
a
number
of
pieces
of
base
metal
the
size
of
sixpences
and
groats
and
copper
coins
miserably
thin
it
took
me
an
hour
even
with
browne
help
to
count
in
this
truly
execrable
money
the
julamerik
sent
word
that
the
english
sovereign
is
selling
at
only
so
owing
to
these
delays
i
have
had
another
day
here
with
its
usual
routine
of
drinking
coffee
in
houses
inviting
women
to
tea
in
my
room
receiving
mountaineers
and
others
who
come
in
at
all
hours
and
kiss
my
hand
and
smoke
their
long
pipes
on
my
floor
and
another
opportunity
of
walking
in
the
glory
of
the
sunset
when
the
mountain
barriers
of
beautiful
kochanes
glow
with
a
colouring
which
suggests
thoughts
of
the
land
which
is
very
far
off
good
browne
makes
himself
one
with
the
people
and
is
most
anxious
for
me
to
identify
everybody
and
say
the
right
thing
to
everybody
no
easy
task
and
as
i
hope
and
fear
that
this
is
my
last
evening
i
have
tried
to
leave
a
pleasant
impression
by
spending
it
in
the
great
called
the
house
mirza
says
that
the
people
talk
of
nothing
but
guns
kurds
the
harvest
and
the
local
news
but
the
conversation
had
a
wider
range
and
was
often
very
amusing
taking
a
sombre
turn
only
when
the
risks
of
my
journey
were
discussed
and
the
possible
misconduct
of
my
kurdish
ishai
who
describes
him
as
a
very
tame
man
not
at
all
my
impression
of
him
has
told
him
that
if
he
gives
any
trouble
the
house
of
mar
shimun
will
never
forget
it
nothing
could
exceed
the
picturesqueness
of
the
house
there
were
doubtless
fifty
people
there
but
the
lamps
which
look
as
old
as
the
relentless
sweep
of
taimurlane
hanging
high
on
the
blackened
pillars
only
lighted
up
the
central
group
consisting
of
sulti
and
marta
in
the
highest
place
the
english
priest
in
his
turban
and
cassock
the
grotesque
visage
of
shlimon
the
jester
and
the
beautiful
face
and
figure
and
splendid
dress
of
ishai
the
brother
as
proud
as
proud
can
be
but
sitting
among
the
retainers
of
his
ancient
house
playing
on
a
musical
instrument
the
hereditary
familiarity
of
serf
and
lord
blending
with
such
expressions
of
respect
as
your
foot
is
on
my
eyes
and
the
favourite
asseveration
by
the
head
of
mar
shimun
the
blackness
in
which
the
lofty
roof
was
lost
the
big
ovens
with
their
busy
groups
the
rows
of
men
in
the
dimness
lounging
on
natural
ledges
of
rock
and
the
uphill
floor
with
its
uncouth
plenishings
made
up
such
a
picture
as
the
feudalism
of
our
own
middle
ages
might
have
presented
my
letter
from
the
turkish
ambassador
at
tihran
was
sent
to
julamerik
this
afternoon
and
has
produced
another
and
an
apology
footnotes
in
the
winter
of
and
the
spring
of
every
effort
was
made
by
fikri
pasha
the
turkish
governor
of
this
district
but
a
kurd
by
race
to
dislodge
browne
from
his
position
in
the
mountains
soldiers
were
continually
sent
to
inquire
into
his
plans
he
was
accused
of
practising
without
a
diploma
as
a
medical
man
because
he
gave
a
few
simple
remedies
to
the
natives
in
a
country
destitute
of
physicians
and
his
position
became
intolerable
when
he
found
that
his
host
mar
shimun
was
being
insulted
and
punished
for
harbouring
him
and
that
the
native
christians
were
being
made
to
suffer
for
his
residence
among
them
the
patriarch
however
stood
firm
presence
here
said
he
to
browne
save
us
from
a
massacre
and
as
for
these
troubles
we
must
put
up
with
them
as
best
we
can

words
were

by

here
in
one
of
the

i
hoped
to
indulge
in
the
luxury
of
my
tent
and
it
was
actually
unrolled
when
all
the
village
men
came
to
me
and
with
gestures
of
appeal
besought
me
not
to
pitch
it
as
it
would
not
be

for
one
hour
and
would
bring
trouble
upon
them
the

suffering
terribly
from

who
are
not

robbing

of
its

else

christians
sow
and
the
kurds
reap
they
breed
cattle
and
sheep
and
the
kurds
drive
them
off
when
they
are
well
grown
one
man
at
a
few
miles
off
had
sheep
he
has
been
robbed
of
all
but
sixty
this
is
but
a
specimen
of
the
wrongs
to
which
these
unhappy
people
are
exposed
the
kurds
now
scarcely
give
them
any
respite
in
which
let
the
sheep
wool
as
their
phrase
is
kotranis
is
my
last
syrian
and
its
miseries
are
well
fitted
to
leave
a
lasting
impression
it
is
included
in
the
of
van
in
which
according
to
the
latest
estimates
there
are
syrian
christians
the
either
own
the
village
lands
or
are
the
dependants
or
serfs
of
a
kurdish
agha
or
master
in
either
case
their
condition
is
deplorable
for
they
have
practically
no
rights
which
a
kurd
or
turk
is
bound
to
respect
in
some
of
their
villages
they
have
been
robbed
till
they
are
absolutely
without
the
means
of
paying
taxes
and
are
beaten
till
the
fact
is
established
beyond
dispute
they
are
but
scantily
supplied
with
the
necessaries
of
life
though
their
industry
produces
abundance
squeezed
between
the
rapacity
and
violence
of
the
kurds
and
the
exactions
of
the
turkish
officials
who
connive
at
outrages
so
long
as
the
victims
are
the
condition
of
these
syrians
is
one
of
the
most
pitiable
on
earth
they
have
no
representatives
in
the
cities
of
europe
and
asia
and
no
commercial
instincts
and
habits
like
the
armenians
they
have
the
oriental
failings
of
untruthfulness
and
avarice
and
the
cunning
begotten
by
centuries
of
oppression
but
otherwise
they
are
simple
grossly
ignorant
helpless
shepherds
and
cultivators
aliens
by
race
and
creed
without
a
rich
or
capable
man
among
them
hemmed
in
by
some
of
the
most
inaccessible
of
mountain
ranges
and
by
their
oppressors
the
kurds
without
a
leader
adviser
or
friend
rarely
visited
by
travellers
with
no
voice
which
can
reach
europe
with
a
present
of
intolerable
bondage
and
a
future
without
light
and
yet
through
all
clinging
passionately
to
the
faith
received
by
tradition
from
their
fathers
as
i
have
no
lodging
but
a
dark
stable
i
am
utilising
the
late
afternoon
sitting
by
the
village
on
which
a
mixed
rabble
of
animals
is
treading
corn
some
buffaloes
are
lying
in
moist
places
looking
amiable
and
foolish
is
tied
to
my
chair
the
village
women
knit
and
stare
two
of
the
men
armed
with
matchlock
guns
keep
a
for
the
kurds
a
crystal
stream
tumbles
through
the
village
over
ledges
of
white
quartz
below
the
valley
opens
and
discloses
ranges
bathed
in
ineffable
blue
the
mountain
sides
are
aflame
with
autumn
tints
and
down
their
steep
paths
oxen
are
bringing
the
tawny
gold
of
the
late
harvest
on
rude
sledges
but
the
shadow
of
the
kurd
is
over
it
all
i
left
people
so
lately
that
i
scarcely
realise
that
i
am
now
alone
in
central
kurdistan
in
one
of
the
wildest
parts
of
the
world
among
fierce
predatory
tribes
and
a
ravaged
and
imperilled
people
i
bade
the
patriarch
farewell
at
six
this
morning
and
even
at
that
early
hour
men
were
seated
all
round
his
room
after
shaking
hands
with
about
thirty
people
i
walked
the
first
mile
accompanied
by
browne
who
then
left
me
on
his
way
to
seek
to
enlighten
the
wild
tribesmen
of
the
tyari
valley
from
the
top
of
the
kamerlan
pass
above
kochanes
the
view
was
inconceivably
beautiful
on
the
lovely
alp
on
which
the
village
stands
a
red
patch
of
autumnal
colouring
flamed
against
the
deep
indigo
and
purple
mountains
of
diz
and
shawutha
which
block
up
the
east
end
of
the
lofty
valley
while
above
these
rose
the
jelu
ranges
said
to
be
from
to
feet
in
altitude
bathed
in
rich
pure
blue
on
their
platforms
snow
on
their
crests
indigo
shadows
in
their
clefts
and
ravines
a
glorious
group
of
spires
peaks
crags
chasms
precipices
rifts
parapets
and
ridges
perfect
in
their
beauty
as
seen
in
the
calm
coloured
atmosphere
in
which
autumn
loves
to
die
higher
up
we
were
in
vast
solitudes
among
splintered
peaks
and
pasturages
where
clear
streams
crashed
over
rock
ledges
or
murmured
under
ice
and
then
a
descent
of
feet
by
steep
zigzags
and
a
seven
hours
march
in
keen
pure
air
brought
us
through
rounded
hills
to
this
village
november
there
was
a
night
alarm
at
kotranis
a
number
of
kurds
came
down
upon
the
and
the
were
most
unwilling
to
drive
off
the
marauders
saying
that
their
only
orders
were
to
protect
me
the
kurds
who
were
at
least
ten
to
one
retired
when
they
saw
the
government
uniforms
but
the
big
dogs
barked
for
the
rest
of
the
night
the
next
day
march
occupied
eleven
hours
it
was
very
cold
light
without
heat
superb
travelling
weather
one
was
a
moslem
the
other
an
armenian
and
there
were
strong
differences
of
opinion
between
them
especially
when
we
halted
to
rest
at
a
christian
village
and
the
kurdish
took
several
sheaves
of
corn
from
a
without
paying
for
them
the
moslem
insisted
that
he
should
not
pay
and
the
christian
that
he
should
and
it
ended
by
my
paying
and
deducting
the
sum
from
his
the
are
usually
men
who
have
served
five
years
with
the
colours
in
eastern
asia
minor
they
are
well
clothed
in
dark
blue
braided
uniforms
and
have
ulsters
in
addition
for
cold
weather
they
provide
their
own
horses
their
pay
is
eighty
piastres
a
month
with
rations
of
bread
for
themselves
and
of
barley
for
their
animals
but
the
pay
is
often
nine
months
in
arrear
or
they
receive
it
in
depreciated
paper
they
are
accused
of
being
directly
or
indirectly
concerned
in
many
robberies
and
of
preying
on
the
peasantry
they
are
armed
with
snider
rifles
swords
and
revolvers
from
the
top
of
a
high
pass
above
kotranis
there
was
a
final
view
of
the
jelu
mountains
and
the
remainder
of
the
day
was
spent
among
hills
streams
and
valleys
with
rich
fertile
soil
and
abundant
water
but
very
thinly
peopled
a
very
ingenious
plough
has
taken
the
place
of
the
primitive
implement
hitherto
used
the
share
is
big
and
heavy
well
shod
with
iron
and
turns
up
the
soil
to
a
great
depth
the
draught
is
from
an
axle
with
two
wheels
one
of
them
two
feet
in
diameter
and
the
other
only
ten
inches
the
big
wheel
runs
in
the
last
furrow
and
the
little
one
on
the
soil
not
yet
upturned
the
axle
being
level
some
of
these
ploughs
were
drawn
by
eight
buffaloes
with
a
boy
singing
an
inharmonious
tune
seated
facing
backwards
on
each
yoke
after
the
ploughing
water
is
turned
on
to
soften
the
clods
which
are
then
broken
up
by
the
husbandmen
with
spades
there
is
a
great
charm
about
the
scenery
as
seen
at
this
season
the
glorious
colouring
towards
sunset
the
fantastic
forms
and
brilliant
tints
of
the
rocks
and
the
purity
of
the
snow
upon
the
heights
but
between
kotranis
and
van
except
for
a
little
planting
in
the
valley
of
the
armenians
there
is
scarcely
a
bush
if
i
had
warm
clothing
i
should
regard
the
temperature
as
perfect
nearly
at
noon
and
falling
to
about
at
night
after
a
severe
march
a
descent
and
a
sudden
turn
in
the
road
brought
us
in
the
purple
twilight
to
merwanen
the
chief
village
of
norduz
streamily
situated
on
a
slope
a
wretched
village
a
partly
finished
house
occupied
by
a
newly
arrived
and
a
number
of
rising
above
the
miserable
hovels
which
bad
as
they
are
were
all
occupied
by
the
attendants
soldiers
kurds
and
villagers
assured
me
that
there
was
no
room
anywhere
and
an
officer
in
a
uniform
drove
my
men
from
pillar
to
post
not
allowing
us
standing
room
on
the
little
dry
ground
that
there
was
i
humbly
asked
if
i
could
pitch
my
tent
but
a
rough
negative
was
returned
a
subterranean
buffalo
stable
where
there
was
just
room
among
the
buffaloes
for
me
to
lie
down
in
a
cramped
position
was
the
only
available
shelter
and
there
was
none
for
the
servants
i
do
not
much
mind
sharing
a
stable
with
but
i
draw
the
line
at
buffaloes
and
came
out
again
into
the
frosty
air
into
an
inhospitable
and
altogether
unprepossessing
crowd
then
there
was
a
commotion
with
much
bowing
and
falling
to
the
right
and
left
and
the
himself
appeared
with
my
powerful
letter
in
his
hand
took
me
into
the
unfinished
house
at
which
he
had
only
arrived
an
hour
before
and
into
a
small
room
almost
altogether
occupied
by
two
beds
on
the
floor
on
one
of
which
a
man
very
ill
of
fever
was
lying
and
on
the
other
an
unveiled
kurdish
beauty
was
sitting
the
though
exceedingly
the
worse
of
drink
was
not
without
a
certain
dignity
and
courtesy
he
apologised
profoundly
for
the
incivility
and
discomfort
which
i
had
met
with
and
for
his
inability
to
entertain
me
with
distinction
in
so
rough
a
place
but
said
that
he
would
give
up
his
own
room
to
so
exalted
a
personage
or
if
i
preferred
a
room
outside
it
should
be
made
ready
of
course
i
chose
the
latter
with
profuse
expressions
of
the
gratitude
i
sincerely
felt
and
after
a
cup
of
coffee
bade
him
the
room
was
the
justice
or
injustice
room
over
the
barracks
and
without
either
door
or
glazed
windows
but
cold
and
stiff
as
i
was
after
an
eleven
hours
march
i
was
thankful
for
any
rest
and
shelter
shortly
my
young
kurdish
a
splendid
fellow
but
not
the
least
tame
announced
that
he
must
leave
me
in
order
to
get
the
escort
of
some
back
to
julamerik
he
said
that
they
all
told
him
that
the
road
to
van
was
full
of
danger
and
that
if
he
went
on
he
would
be
robbed
of
his
mules
and
money
on
the
way
back
no
transport
however
was
to
be
got
and
he
came
on
with
me
very
pluckily
and
has
got
an
escort
back
at
least
to
merwanen
in
the
morning
the
rose
early
to
do
me
honour
but
was
so
tipsy
that
he
could
scarcely
sit
upright
on
his
chair
on
a
stone
dais
amidst
a
rabble
of
soldiers
and
scribes
we
were
all
benumbed
with
cold
and
glad
that
the
crossing
of
an
expanse
of
frozen
streams
rendered
walking
a
necessity
a
nine
hours
march
through
mountains
remarkable
for
rocky
spires
and
needles
marvellously
coloured
and
for
the
absence
of
inhabitants
took
us
to
the
armenian
village
of
khanjarak
finely
situated
in
a
corrie
upon
a
torrent
bank
but
it
is
so
subterranean
and
so
built
into
the
hillside
that
a
small
square
church
and
conical
piles
of
are
the
only
obvious
objects
and
i
rode
over
the
roofs
without
knowing
what
was
underneath
all
the
women
and
children
came
out
of
their
holes
clothed
in
red
rags
and
some
wore
strings
of
coins
round
their
heads
the
men
were
dressed
like
kurds
and
were
nearly
as
they
protested
against
my
tent
being
pitched
they
said
the
kurds
were
always
on
the
watch
and
would
hack
it
with
their
swords
in
half
an
hour
to
get
at
its
contents
that
they
had
only
three
matchlock
guns
and
that
the
kurds
were
armed
with
rifles
i
felt
that
i
could
scarcely
touch
a
lower
depth
in
the
matter
of
accommodation
than
when
they
lodged
me
in
a
dark
subterranean
stable
running
very
far
back
into
the
hill
with
a
fire
of
animal
fuel
in
the
middle
giving
off
dense
and
acrid
fumes
a
recess
in
this
with
a
mud
bench
was
curtained
off
for
me
and
the
rest
of
the
space
was
occupied
by
my
own
horses
and
baggage
mules
and
most
of
the
village
asses
goats
cows
calves
and
sheep
several
horses
belonging
to
travellers
and
to
my
own
escort
were
also
there
and
all
the
servants
travellers
and
were
lodged
there
there
were
legions
of
fleas
revelling
in
a
temperature
which
rose
to
at
midnight
though
there
were
of
frost
outside
in
the
part
of
the
roof
which
projected
from
the
hill
there
were
two
holes
for
light
but
at
night
these
were
carefully
closed
with
corks
of
plaited
straw
the
wretched
poverty
of
the
people
of
this
place
made
a
very
painful
impression
on
me
they
have
exaggerated
when
they
told
me
how
terribly
they
are
oppressed
by
the
kurds
who
they
say
last
year
robbed
them
of
sheep
and
this
year
of
and
some
cattle
having
been
driven
off
a
few
days
before
but
it
is
a
simple
fact
that
the
night
of
my
visit
the
sheep
for
which
there
was
no
room
in
the
stable
were
carried
away
by
a
party
of
kurds
in
the
bright
moonlight
the
helpless
shepherds
not
daring
to
resist
it
is
of
no
use
they
say
to
petition
the
government
it
will
not
interfere
the
kurds
come
into
their
houses
they
say
and
terrify
and
insult
their
women
and
by
demands
with
violence
take
away
all
they
have
they
say
that
the
money
for
which
they
have
sold
their
grain
and
which
they
were
keeping
to
pay
their
taxes
with
was
taken
by
the
kurds
last
week
and
that
they
will
be
cruelly
beaten
by
the
because
they
can
not
pay
their
words
and
air
expressed
abject
terror
their
little
church
is
poorer
than
poverty
itself
a
building
of
undressed
stone
without
mortar
and
its
length
of
thirteen
feet
includes
the
rude
mud
dais
occupied
by
the
yet
ruder
altar
its
furniture
consists
of
an
iron
censer
an
iron
saucer
containing
oil
and
a
wick
and
an
earthen
flagon
there
are
no
windows
and
the
rough
walls
are
black
with
candle
smoke
the
young
man
who
showed
the
church
took
a
gospel
from
the
dais
kissing
the
cross
upon
it
before
handing
it
to
me
and
then
on
seeing
that
i
was
interested
went
home
and
brought
a
of
matthew
gospel
with
several
scenes
from
our
lord
life
christos
he
said
with
a
smile
as
he
pointed
to
the
central
figure
in
the
first
illustration
and
so
on
as
he
showed
me
the
others
for
in
each
there
was
a
figure
of
the
christ
not
crowned
and
risen
but
suffering
and
humiliated
next
morning
in
the
bitter
cold
of
the
hour
before
sunrise
the
clang
of
the
mallet
on
the
assembled
the
villagers
for
matins
and
to
the
christ
crowned
and
risen
and
sitting
on
the
right
hand
of
power
they
rendered
honour
as
divine
though
in
the
midst
of
the
grossest
superstition
and
darkness
and
for
him
whom
they
ignorantly
worship
they
are
at
this
moment
suffering
the
loss
of
all
things
their
empty
sheepfold
might
have
been
full
if
they
had
acknowledged
him
as
a
prophet
and
no
more
leaving
this
wretched
hamlet
where
the
unfortunate
peasants
are
as
avaricious
as
they
are
poor
and
dirty
and
passing
a
kurdish
village
with
a
stone
fort
picturesquely
situated
we
crossed
a
pass
into
a
solitary
valley
on
which
high
rounded
hills
descend
in
harmonised
buffs
and
browns
both
hills
and
valleys
covered
with
uncut
hay
the
said
that
this
was
a
specially
dangerous
place
and
urged
the
caravan
to
its
utmost
speed
we
met
three
armenian
in
their
shirts
they
complained
most
bitterly
that
they
had
been
robbed
an
hour
before
of
five
mules
with
their
equipments
as
well
as
of
their
clothing
and
money
the
ascent
and
the
very
tedious
descent
of
the
kasrik
kala
pass
brought
us
into
the
large
and
fertile
plain
of
haizdar
the
plain
of
the
armenians
sprinkled
with
armenian
villages
and
much
cultivated
mirza
and
one
had
gone
back
for
a
blanket
which
had
been
dropped
and
after
halting
in
an
orchard
till
i
was
i
decided
to
proceed
without
them
having
understood
that
we
could
reach
van
in
three
hours
i
started
my
party
by
signs
and
after
an
riding
reached
a
village
where
johannes
spoke
fluently
in
an
unknown
tongue
and
the
held
up
five
fingers
which
i
learned
too
late
meant
that
van
was
five
hours
off
i
thought
that
they
were
asking
for
instructions
and
at
every
pause
i
repeated
after
a
brief
consultation
we
went
up
among
the
hills
the
young
kurdish
jumping
yelling
singing
and
howling
to
keep
his
mules
at
a
trot
the
urging
them
with
his
whip
and
pointing
ominously
at
the
fast
sinking
sun
on
we
clattered
with
much
noise
nor
did
we
slacken
speed
till
we
gained
a
high
altitude
among
desert
solitudes
from
which
we
looked
down
upon
the
dead
sea
of
van
a
sheet
of
water
extending
in
one
direction
beyond
the
limits
of
vision
lying
red
and
weird
with
high
mountains
jutting
into
it
in
lofty
headlands
hovered
over
by
clouds
high
up
along
the
mountain
side
in
a
wavy
line
lay
the
path
to
van
in
the
deepening
shadows
and
the
this
time
holding
up
three
fingers
still
urged
on
the
caravan
and
the
kurd
responded
by
yells
and
howls
dancing
and
jumping
like
a
madman
just
as
it
was
becoming
dark
four
mounted
men
each
armed
with
two
guns
rode
violently
among
the
mules
which
were
in
front
of
me
and
attempted
to
drive
them
off
in
the
the
was
knocked
down
the
jumped
off
his
horse
threw
the
bridle
to
me
and
shouldered
his
rifle
when
they
saw
the
government
uniform
these
kurds
drew
back
let
the
mules
go
and
passed
on
the
whole
affair
took
but
a
few
seconds
but
it
was
significant
of
the
unwillingness
of
the
kurds
to
come
into
collision
with
the
turks
and
of
the
power
the
government
could
exercise
in
the
disturbed
districts
if
it
were
once
understood
that
the
marauders
were
not
to
be
allowed
a
free
hand
after
this
attack
not
a
word
was
spoken
the
bells
were
taken
off
the
mules
the
as
fine
and
soldierly
a
man
as
one
could
wish
to
see
marched
in
front
quiet
and
vigilant
and
so
in
a
darkness
in
which
i
could
not
see
my
horse
ears
we
proceeded
till
three
hours
later
the
moon
rose
as
we
entered
van
it
was
one
of
the
rides
i
ever
made
and
i
had
many
painful
reflections
on
having
risked
through
ignorance
the
property
of
my
faithful
kurdish
the
first
light
of
van
was
a
welcome
sight
though
after
that
there
was
a
long
ride
to
the
gardens
a
large
wooded
suburb
chiefly
inhabited
by
armenians
in
which
the
american
missionaries
live
reynolds
the
medical
missionary
has
given
me
a
most
hospitable
welcome
though
his
small
house
is
more
than
full
with
new
arrivals
from
america
i
wanted
to
my
jolly
for
bitlis
but
he
went
back
at
once
with
the
and
after
the
obvious
perils
of
the
road
it
would
not
have
been
fair
to
detain
him
visitors
are
scarce
here
van
does
not
see
more
than
one
european
in
three
years
the
says
that
he
should
have
doubted
the
sanity
of
any
one
who
had
proposed
to
travel
from
urmi
to
van
by
the
route
i
took
but
now
that
the
journey
is
safely
over
i
am
glad
that
no
one
at
urmi
knew
enough
to
dissuade
me
from
it
the
and
all
the
mission
party
are
as
kind
as
they
can
be
and
van
is
for
me
another
oasis
footnotes
i
must
ask
my
readers
to
believe
that
i
crossed
the
turkish
frontier
without
any
knowledge
of
or
interest
in
the
armenian
question
that
so
far
from
having
any
special
liking
for
the
armenians
i
had
rather
a
prejudice
against
them
that
i
was
in
ignorance
of
the
erzerum
troubles
of
june
and
of
yet
more
recent
complications
and
that
the
sole
object
of
my
journey
by
a
route
seldom
traversed
by
europeans
from
urmi
to
van
was
to
visit
the
patriarch
of
the
nestorians
and
the
kochanes
station
of
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
assyrian
church
mission
and
that
afterwards
i
travelled
to
erzerum
bitlis
only
to
visit
the
american
missionaries
there
so
far
as
i
know
i
entered
turkey
as
a
perfectly
neutral
and
impartial
observer
and
without
any
special
interest
in
its
christian
populations
and
it
is
only
the
inexorable
logic
of
facts
which
has
convinced
me
of
their
wrongs
and
claims
in
another
village
a
young
man
in
speaking
of
their
circumstances
said
we
do
know
much
but
we
love
the
lord
jesus
well
enough
to
die
for
him
letter
xxxi
van
armenia
van
and
its
surroundings
are
at
once
so
interesting
and
picturesque
that
it
is
remarkable
that
they
are
comparatively
seldom
visited
by
travellers
probably
the
insecurity
of
the
roads
the
villainous
accommodation
and
its
isolated
position
account
for
the
neglect
here
as
elsewhere
i
am
much
impressed
with
the
excellence
of
the
work
done
by
the
american
missionaries
who
are
really
the
lights
of
these
dark
places
and
by
their
exemplary
and
honourable
lives
furnish
that
and
standard
of
living
which
is
more
efficacious
than
preaching
in
lifting
up
the
lives
of
a
people
sunk
in
the
depths
of
a
grossly
corrupted
christianity
the
boys
and
schools
in
van
are
on
an
excellent
basis
and
are
not
only
turning
out
capable
men
and
women
but
are
stimulating
the
armenians
to
raise
the
teaching
and
tone
of
their
own
schools
in
the
city
with
one
of
which
i
was
very
greatly
pleased
the
creation
of
churches
strict
in
their
discipline
and
protesting
against
the
mass
of
superstitions
which
smother
all
spiritual
life
in
the
national
armenian
church
is
undoubtedly
having
a
very
salutary
effect
far
beyond
the
limited
membership
and
is
tending
to
upon
an
ancient
church
which
contains
within
herself
the
elements
of
resurrection
great
honour
is
due
to
reynolds
for
the
way
in
which
almost
he
has
kept
the
valuable
work
of
this
mission
going
for
years
and
now
that
colleagues
have
arrived
a
considerable
development
may
be
hoped
for
i
have
confessed
already
to
a
prejudice
against
the
armenians
but
it
is
not
possible
to
deny
that
they
are
the
most
capable
energetic
enterprising
and
pushing
race
in
western
asia
physically
superior
and
intellectually
acute
and
above
all
they
are
a
race
which
can
be
raised
in
all
respects
to
our
own
level
neither
religion
colour
customs
nor
inferiority
in
intellect
or
force
constituting
any
barrier
between
us
their
shrewdness
and
aptitude
for
business
are
remarkable
and
whatever
exists
of
commercial
enterprise
in
eastern
asia
minor
is
almost
altogether
in
their
hands
they
have
singular
elasticity
as
their
survival
as
a
church
and
nation
shows
and
i
can
not
but
think
it
likely
that
they
may
have
some
share
in
determining
the
course
of
events
in
the
east
both
politically
and
religiously
as
orientals
they
understand
oriental
character
and
modes
of
thought
as
we
never
can
and
if
a
new
pentecostal
were
to
fall
upon
the
educated
and
intelligent
young
men
who
are
being
trained
in
the
colleges
which
the
american
churches
have
scattered
liberally
through
asia
minor
the
effect
upon
turkey
would
be
marvellous
i
think
most
decidedly
that
reform
in
turkey
must
come
through
christianity
and
in
this
view
the
reform
and
enlightenment
of
the
religion
which
has
such
a
task
before
it
are
of
momentous
importance
islam
is
cabined
cribbed
confined
its
forms
of
belief
and
thought
and
its
social
and
political
ideas
remain
in
the
moulds
into
which
they
were
run
at
its
rise
expansion
is
impossible
the
arrogance
which
the
koran
inculcates
and
fosters
is
a
dead
weight
on
progress
if
the
turk
had
any
disposition
to
initiate
and
carry
out
reforms
his
creed
and
its
traditions
would
fetter
him
islam
with
its
fanaticism
narrowness
obstructiveness
and
is
really
at
this
moment
the
greatest
obstacle
to
every
species
of
advance
both
in
turkey
and
persia
and
its
present
activity
and
renewed
proselytising
spirit
are
omens
of
evil
as
much
for
political
and
social
progress
as
for
the
higher
life
of
men
the
mission
houses
and
schools
are
on
fairly
high
ground
more
than
two
miles
from
van
in
what
are
known
as
the
gardens
where
most
of
the
armenians
and
turkish
officials
reside
these
gardens
filled
with
vineyards
and
all
manner
of
fruit
trees
extend
for
a
distance
of
five
miles
and
being
from
two
to
three
miles
wide
their
mass
of
greenery
has
a
really
beautiful
effect
among
them
are
many
very
good
houses

the
roads

by
which
they
are
intersected
are
well
planted
with
poplars
and
willows
shading
pleasant
streams
which
supply
the

the

a
glorious

are

the

the
town

nearly
a
mile
from

and
is
built
on
an
open

space
in
the
midst
of
which
stands
a
most
picturesque
and
extraordinary
rock
which
rises
perpendicularly
to
a
height
of
about
feet
it
falls
abruptly
at
both
extremities
and
its
outline
which
colonel
severs
bell
estimates
at
yards
in
length
is
emphasised
by
battlemented
walls
several
towers
and
a
solitary
minaret
rising
above
the
picturesque
irregularity
of
the
ancient
fortifications
admission
to
the
interior

have
not

according
to

named
it
shemiramagerd

was
accustomed
to
resort
to

gregory
the

having
been
consecrated
at
cæsarea
as
bishop
of
armenia
in
the
second
year
of
the
fourth
century
in
the
fifteenth
century
a
schism
brought
about
by
jesuit
missionaries
resulted
in
a
number
of
armenians
joining
the
church
of
rome
and
becoming
later
a
separate
community
known
as
the
catholic
armenian
church
within
the
last
under
the
teaching
of
the
american
missionaries
a
reformed
church
has
arisen
known
as
the
protestant
armenian
church
but
with
these
exceptions
the
race
and
the
national
church
may
be
regarded
as

the
armenians
have
had
no
political
existence
since
the

but
form
an
element
of
stability
and
wealth
in
turkey
russia
and
persia
where
they
are
principally
found
their
language
is
regarded
by
scholars
as
an
of
the
iranian
branch
of
the
group
of

their
existing
literature
dates
from
the
fourth
century
and
all
that
is
not
exclusively
christian
has
perished
translations
of
the
old
and
new
testaments
dating
from
the
fifth
century
are
among
its
oldest
monuments
and
the
dialect
in
which
they
are
written
and
in
which
they
are
still
read
in
the
churches
known
as
old
armenian
is
not
now
understood
by
the
people
during
the
last
century
there
has
been
a
great
revival
of
letters
among
the
armenians
chiefly
due
to
the
of
venice
and
a
literature
in
modern
armenian
is
rapidly
developing
alongside
of
the
study
and
publication
of
the
works
of
the
ancient
writers
it
has
however
received
due
attention
both
from
scholars
and
antiquaries
and
among
the
accounts
of
it
are
very
interesting
chapters
in
sir
layard

and
in

here
two

having
ridden
the
ninety
miles
from

in
three
and
a
half
days
reynolds
accompanied
me
and
as
we
had
a
couple
of
on
good
horses
we
deserted
the
caravan
and
came
along
at
as
good
a
pace
as
the
mountainous
nature
of
the
road
would
allow
the
early
winter
weather
is
absolutely
perfect
for
travelling
all
along
i
am
quite
impressed
with
the
resemblance
which
the
southern
shores
of

bear
to
some
of
the
most
beautiful
parts
of

travellers
lose
a
great
deal
by
taking
the
easier
route
round
the
north
shore
of
the

the
first
day
half
march
ended
at
angugh
an
armenian
village
on
the
river
hashal
on
the
plain
of
haizdar
or
haigatsor
where
the
people
complained
of
some
armenian
women
having
been
despoiled
of
their
jewels
by
some
kurds
during
the
afternoon
the
views
are
magnificent
especially
of
the
christian
village
of
artemid
on
a
spur
on
a
height
with
a
moslem
village
in
gardens
below
with
green
natural
lawns
sloping
to
the
lake
at
angugh
i
was
well
accommodated
in
a
granary
on
a
roof
and
as
there
was
no
room
for
my
bed
found
a
comfortable
substitute
in
a
blanket
spread
upon
the
wheat
the
next
day
march
was
through
exquisitely
beautiful
scenery
partly
skirting
deep
bays
on
paths
cut
in
the
rock
above
them
among
oaks
and
ferns
and
partly
crossing
high
steep
promontories
which
jut
out
into
the
lake
a
few
villages
where
strips
of
level
ground
and
water
for
irrigation
can
be
obtained
are
passed
and
among
them
the
village
of
vastan
the
seat
of

for
the

telegraph
station
but
in
the
eleventh

there
are
grand

are
bridged

the

of

at
the

of

on
a
rocky
spur
above
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
the
many
wooded
valleys
which
descend
upon
the
lake
of
van
lend
an
air
of
medieval
romance
to
a
scene
as
fair
as
nature
can
make
it
nearly
all
the
romantic
valleys
opening
on
the
lake
are
adorned
with
one
or
more
villages
with

these

occasionally
the

are
built
at
the
feet
of

on

all
is
as
fair
as
fair
can
be
though
the
state
of
things
among
the
christians
is
not
nearly
so
bad
as
in
some
of
the
syrian
valleys
the
shadow
of
the
kurd
is
over
this
paradise
the
armenians
complain
of
robbery
with
violence
as
being
of
constant
occurrence
and
that
they
have
been
plundered
till
they
are
unable
to
pay
the
taxes
and
it
is
obvious
that
travellers
unless
in
large
companies
are
not
safe
without
a
government
escort
in
each

the
common
sheepfold
is
guarded
from
sunset
to

by
a
number
of

a
heavy

should
ensure
them

in
one
of
the
fairest
bays
on
this
south
side
of

is
the

eleven
monks
with
their
pupils
inhabit
the
rock
it
is
a
very
ancient
foundation
dating
from

the
church
is
attributed
to
the
armenian
king
kakhik
who
reigned
in
the
tenth
century
it
is
a
cruciform
building
with
a
hexagonal
tower
and
a
conical
terminal
at
the
intersection
of
the
cross
the
simple
interior
is
decorated
with
some
very
rude
pictures
and
a
gilded
throne
for
the
patriarch
stands
at
the
east
end
this
patriarchate
of
akhtamar
the
occupant
of
which
has
at
times
claimed
the
title
of
was
founded
in
by
an
archbishop
of
akhtamar
who
declared
himself
independent
of
the
of
the
armenian
church
who
resides
in
echmiadzin
but
at
the
present
time
he
has
only
a
few
adherents
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
van
and
has
the
reputation
of
extreme
ignorance
and
of
being
more
of
a
farmer
than
an
ecclesiastic
he
was
at
haikavank
at
the
fine
farm
on
the
mainland
possessed
by
the
convent
but
we
had
not
time
to
call
plain
as
is
the
interior
of
the
church
of
akhtamar
the
exterior
is
most
elaborately
ornamented
with
very
much
undercut
three
of
the
roofs
rest
on
friezes
on
which
birds
and
beasts
in
singularly
vigorous
action
are
portrayed
and
there
are
besides
two
rows
of
heads
in
high
relief
and
a
number
of
scripture
subjects
very
boldly
treated
in
addition
to
some
elaborate
and
bands
of
rich
foliage
on
this
remarkable
rock
reynolds
and
his
family
took
refuge
a
few
years
ago
when
it
was
apprehended
that
van
would
be
sacked
by
the
kurds
the
vivid
colouring
of
the
lake
is
emphasised
by
a
line
of
pure
white
deposit
which
runs
round
its
margin
and
vivacity
is
given
to
its
waters
by
innumerable
wild
fowl
flamingoes
geese
ducks
pelicans
cormorants
etc
from
a
reedy
swamp
near
it
ducks

in
such
numbers
as
literally
to
darken
the
air
carbonate
of
soda
and
chloride
of
sodium
are
obtained
from
the
lake
water
by
evaporation
but
it
is
not
nearly
so
salt
as
that
of
the
sea
of
urmi
not
very
far
from
the
south
shore
a
powerful
spring
bubbles
up
in
the
midst
of
the
salt
water
the
only
fish
known
of

a
species
said
to
be
like
a
small
herring
these
are
captured
in
enormous
quantities
in
the
spring
as
they
come
up
into
the
streams
which
feed
the
lake
on
the
last
two
nights
at
undzag
and
ghazit
i
had
my
first
experiences
of
the
turkish
or
village
or
of
which
as
similar
abodes
will
be
my
lodgings
throughout
my
journey
to
erzerum
i
will
try
to
give
you
an
idea
usually
partially
excavated
in
the
hillside
and
partly
imbedded
in
the
earth
the
is
a
large
rambling
room
with
an
irregular
roof
supported
on
rough
in
the
centre
or
some
other
convenient
place
is
a
mud
platform
slightly
raised
in
the
better
class
of
this
has
a
fireplace
in
the
wall
at
one
end
round
this
on
three
sides
is
a
deep
manger
and
similar
mangers
run
along
the
side
walls
and
into
the
irregular
recesses
which
are
lost
in
the
darkness
the
platform
is
for
human
beings
and
the
rest
of
the
building
for
horses
mules
oxen
asses
and
buffaloes
with
a
few
sheep
and
goats
probably
in
addition
the
and
the
humbler
class
of
travellers
sleep
among
the
beasts
the
remainder
without
distinction
of
race
creed
or
sex
on
the
enclosed
space
light
enters
from
the
door
and
from
a
few
small
holes
in
the
roof
which
are
carefully
corked
up
at
night
and
then
a
few
iron
cups
of
oil
with
wicks
the
primitive
lamp
in
general
use
hanging
upon
the
posts
give
forth
a
smoky
light
in
such
an
there
may
be
any
number
of
human
beings
cooking
eating
and
sleeping
and
from
twenty
to
a
hundred
animals
or
more
as
well
as
the
loads
of
the
and
the
arms
of
the
travellers
as
the
eye
becomes
accustomed
to
the
smoke
and
dimness
it
sees
rows
of
sweet
ox
faces
with
mild
eyes
and
moist
nostrils
and
wild
horse
faces
surrounding
the
enclosure
and
any
number
more
receding
into
the
darkness
ceaseless
munching
goes
on
and
a
neigh
or
a
squeal
from
some
unexpected
corner
startles
one
or
there
is
a
horse
fight
which
takes
a
number
of
men
to
quell
it
each
animal
is
a
living
stove
and
the
heat
and
closeness
are
so
insupportable
that
one
awakes
quite
unrefreshed
in
the
morning
in
a
temperature
of
the
is
one
of
the
great
features
of
travelling
in
eastern
asia
minor
i
dined
and
spent
the
evenings
in
its
warmth
and
cheeriness
enjoying
its
wild
picturesqueness
but
at
undzag
i
pitched
my
small
tent
at
the
stable
door
and
at
ghazit
on
the
roof
and
braved
the
cold
in
it
is
usually
close
to
me
eating
scraps
from
my
dinner
and
gently
biting
the
back
of
my
neck
when
he
thinks
that
i
am
forgetting
his
presence
he
amuses
all
the
men
everywhere
by
his
affectionateness
and
eating
out
of
my
hand
and
following
me
like
a
dog
i
never
saw
so
gentle
and
trustworthy
a
creature
his
hair
has
grown
very
long
thick
and
woolly
and
curls
in
parts
like
that
of
a
retriever
his
sweet
ways
have
provided
him
with
a
home
after
his
powerful
legs
and
big
feet
have
trudged
with
me
to
trebizond
for
my
hosts
here
who
are
old
and
somewhat
frail
have
taken
such
a
fancy
to
his
gentleness
and
winsomeness
that
he
is
to
return
to
them
when
the
roads
open
in
the
spring
it
was
a
grand
ride
from
undzag
over
lofty
mountain
passes
to
the
village
of
ghazit
built
in
a
deep
de
above
the
lake
terraces
one
above
another
rise
from
the
lake
shore
so
beautifully
cultivated
as
to
realise
emerson
description
of
the
appearance
of
english
soil
tilled
with
a
pencil
instead
of
a
plough
a
church
stands
on
a
height
and
the
village
almost
hidden
among
magnificent
walnuts
is
crowded
upon
a
terrace
of
green
sward
at
the
foot
of
a
semicircle
of
mountains
which
wall
it
in
from
the
world
the
narrow
village
road
with
its
low
stone
houses
was
prettily
brightened
by
colour
for
all
the
women
were
dressed
more
or
less
in
red
and
wore
high
red
coronets
with
dependent
strings
of
coins
and
broad
aprons
reaching
from
the
throat
to
the
feet
of
coarse
dark
blue
cotton
completely
covered
with
handsome
patterns
worked
in
in
silk
fine
walnut
trees
are
one
of
the
specialities
of
this
part
of
turkey
they
provide
much
of
the
oil
which
is
used
during
the
long
fasts
which
both
armenians
and
syrians
observe
and
they
develop
very
large
woody
excrescences
or
knots
the
grain
and
mottling
of
which
are
peculiarly
beautiful
these
are
sought
for
by
buyers
for
paris
houses
even
in
the
remote
valleys
of
kurdistan
for
use
in
the
making
and
veneering
of
furniture
especially
of
pianos
fortunately
the
removal
of
this
growth
does
not
kill
the
tree
and
after
a
time
the
bark
grows
over
much
of
the
uncovered
portion
of
the
trunk
only
a
scar
being
left
at
sunset
that
evening
sheep
were
driven
into
the
village
sheepfold
just
below
the
roof
on
which
my
tent
was
pitched
and
it
was
a
very
picturesque
scene
men
pushing
their
way
through
them
to
find
their
own
sheep
by
women
with
difficulty
milking
ewes
here
and
there
big
dogs
barking
furiously
from
the
roofs
above
and
all
the
sheep
bleating
at
once
in
winter
they
are
all
housed
and
hand
fed
the
snow
lies
six
feet
deep
and
ghazit
can
communicate
neither
with
bitlis
nor
van
it
is
the
milk
of
the
flocks
which
is
prized
cows
milk
is
thought
but
little
of
i
made
my
supper
of
one
of
the
great
articles
of
diet
in
turkey
boiled
cracked
wheat
sugar
and
artificially
soured
milk
looking
like
whipped
cream
i
was
glad
to
escape
to
my
tent
from
the
heat
and
odours
of
the
even
though
i
had
to
walk
over
sheep
backs
to
get
up
to
the
roof
i
had
a
guard
of
two
men
and
eight
more
armed
with
useless
matchlock
guns
watched
the
sheepfold
i
was
awakened
by
a
tremendous
noise
the
barking
of
infuriated
dogs
close
to
me
the
clashing
of
arms
and
the
shouts
of
men
mixed
up
with
the
rapid
firing
of
guns
not
far
off
on
the
mountain
side
so
near
indeed
that
i
could
see
the
flashes
it
was
a
kurdish
alarm
but
nothing
came
of
it
a
village
which
we
passed
a
few
hours
later
was
robbed
of
sheep
however
leaving
beautiful
ghazit
before
the
sun
rose
upon
it
the
next
morning
we
spent
some
hours
in
skirting
the
lake
and
in
crossing
elevated
passes
and
following
paths
along
hillsides
covered
with
oaks
the
russet
leaves
of
which
are
being
cut
for
winter
keep
the
dwarf
juniper
is
also
abundant
after
crossing
a
pass
on
the
top
of
which
are
graves
covered
with
heavy
stone
slabs
with
inscriptions
on
their
sides
and
eight
feet
high
inscribed
with
epitaphs
in
kufic
or
early
arabic
we
descended
upon
the
great
plain
of
rahwan
separated
from
the
plain
of
mush
only
by
a
very
low
ridge
which
however
is
a
remarkable
dividing
the
drainage
systems
of
the
tigris
and
the
euphrates
on
this
solitary
plain
there
are
the
ruins
of
a
magnificent
building
known
as
the
persian
khan
built
of
large
blocks
of
hewn
stone
parts
of
it
are
still
available
for
shelter
during
snowstorms
it
has
courtyards
with
stately
entrances
domes
arches
and
vaulted
chambers
and
is
a
very
striking
object
two
other
are
placed
as
refuges
in
the
valley
nearer
bitlis
shortly
afterwards
we
reached
the
of
three
valleys
and
three
roads
leading
respectively
to
the
plain
of
mush
the
lake
of
van
and
bitlis
it
is
in
this
neighbourhood
that
the
eastern
source
of
the
tigris
is
situated
and
here
there
is
also
the
great
interest
of
coming
upon
one
of
the
landmarks
on
the
retreat
of
the
ten
thousand
scholars
appear
to
agree
in
general
that
this
gallant
band
must
have
come
up
by
these
eastern
sources
of
the
tigris
for
then
as
now
the
only
practicable
entrance
into
armenia
from
the
karduchi
territory
the
modern
kurdistan
was
by
this
route
the
march
was
very
long
and
fatiguing
and
as
we
were
compelled
to
rest
for
two
hours
at
the
village
of
toogh
evening
was
coming
on
with
a
gray
sky
and
a
lurid
sunset
before
we
left
the
rahwan
plain
after
which
we
had
a
ride
of
more
than
three
hours
down
the
wild
and
stony
bitlis
valley
before
we
reached
our
destination
if
i
had
made
this
march
in
spring
when
herbage
and
flowers
drape
the
nakedness
of
the
rocky
and
gravelly
mountains
and
precipices
it
would
not
have
made
such
an
impression
upon
me
as
it
did
but
seeing
the
apparently
endless
valley
for
ever
winding
and
falling
to
the
south
with
two
bars
of
lurid
light
for
ever
lying
across
what
never
proved
to
be
its
opening
and
the
higher
peaks
rising
into
a
dark
and
sky
i
think
it
one
of
the
weirdest
and
wildest
rides
i
ever
took
the
infant
tigris
is
rapidly
augmented
by
a
number
of
streams
and
torrents
the
descent
was
like
taking
leave
of
the
bright
upper
world
to
go
down
into
some
nether
region
from
which
there
would
be
no
exit
the
valley
at
times
narrowing
into
a
ravine
is
hemmed
in
by
sterile
mountains
so
steep
as
not
to
afford
sites
for
villages
there
are
parapetless
ancient
arches
of
stone
flung
across
torrents
which
have
carved
hideous
pathways
for
themselves
through
hideous
rocks
scoriæ
and
other
signs
of
volcanic
action
rough
gulches
with
narrow
paths
hanging
on
their
sides
and
in
spite
of
many
climbs
upwards
the
course
is
on
the
whole
downwards
darkness
settled
upon
the
valley
long
before
lights
in
what
looked
like
infinite
depths
and
straggling
up
remarkable
heights
trees
stone
walls
and
such
steep
ups
and
downs
that
it
felt
as
if
the
horses
were
going
to
topple
over
precipices
denoted
that
we
had
entered
bitlis
then
came
a
narrow
gateway
a
flagged
courtyard
choked
with
mules
and
men
a
high
house
with
windows
a
steep
outside
stair
and
at
the
top
sweet
faces
and
sweet
voices
of
european
women
and
lights
and
warm
welcomes
november
this
is
the
most
city
that
i
have
seen
in
western
asia
the
dreamy
impressions
of
height
and
depth
received
on
the
night
of
my
arrival
were
more
than
realised
the
following
morning
even
to
the
traveller
arriving
by
daylight
bitlis
must
come
as
a
great
surprise
for
it
is
situated
in
a
hole
upon
which
the
upper
valley
descends
with
a
sudden
dip
the
or
eastern
tigris
passes
through
it
in
a
series
of
raging
cataracts
and
is
joined
in
the
middle
of
the
town
by
another
torrent
tumbling
down
another
wild
valley
and
from
this
meeting
of
the
waters
massive
stone
houses
rise
one
above
another
singly
and
in
groups
and
terraces
producing
a
singularly
striking
effect
five
valleys
appear
to
unite
in
bitlis
and
to
radiate
from
a
lofty
platform
of
rock
supported
on
precipices
the
irregular
outlines
of
which
are
emphasised
by
walls
and
massive
square
and
circular
towers
the
gigantic
ruins
of
bitlis
castle
the
massiveness
of
the
houses
is
remarkable
and
their
courtyards
and
gardens
are
enclosed
by
strong
walls
every
gate
is
strengthened
and
studded
with
iron
every
window
is
heavily
barred
all
are
at
a
considerable
height
and
every
house
looks
as
if
it
could
stand
a
siege
there
is
no
room
to
spare
the
dwellings
are
piled
tier
above
tier
and
the
flagged
footways
in
front
of
them
hang
on
the
edges
of
precipices
twenty
picturesque
stone
bridges
each
one
of
a
single
arch
span
the
tigris
and
the
torrents
which
unite
with
it
there
are
ancient
ruins
scattered
through
the
town
it
claims
immense
antiquity
and
its
inhabitants
ascribe
its
castle
and
some
of
its
bridges
to
alexander
the
great
but
antiquarians
attribute
the
former
either
to
the
saracens
or
to
the
days
when
an
ancient
armenian
city
called
paghesh
occupied
the
site
of
the
present
bitlis
it
seems
like
the
end
of
the
world
though
through
the
deep
chasms
below
it
through
which
the
tigris
descends
with
great
rapidity
to
the
plains
lies
the
highway
to
diabekir
suggestions
of
the
ancient
world
abound
the
lofty
summits
towering
above
the
basin
in
which
this
extraordinary
city
lies
are
the
termination
of
the
taurus
chain
the
niphates
of
the
ancients
on
the
highest
peak
of
which
milton
localised
the
descent
of
satan
remote
as
bitlis
seems
and
is
its
markets
are
among
the
busiest
in
turkey
and
its
caravan
traffic
is
enormous
for
seven
or
eight
months
of
the
year
its
altitude
is
only
feet
and
the
mercury
in
winter
rarely
falls
to
zero
but
the
snowfall
is
tremendous
and
on
the
rahwan
plain
snow
frequently
lies
up
to
the
top
of
the
telegraph
poles
isolating
the
town
and
shutting
up
animals
in
their
stables
and
human
beings
in
their
houses
for
weeks
and
occasionally
months
at
a
time
bitlis
produces
a
very
coarse
heavy
cotton
cloth
which
after
being
dyed
madder
red
or
dark
blue
is
largely
exported
and
is
used
for
the
embroidered
aprons
which
the
armenian
women
wear
it
also
exports
the
walnut
whorls
or
knots
of
which
i
have
written
before
oak
galls
wax
wool
and
manna
chiefly
collected
from
the
oak
the
bitlis
people
and
even
some
europeans
regard
this
as
a
deposit
left
by
the
aromatic
exhalations
which
the
wind
brings
in
this
direction
from
arabia
and
they
say
that
it
lies
on
any
plant
without
regard
to
its
nature
and
even
on
the
garments
of
men
the
deposit
is
always
greatest
in
dry
years
in
addition
to
the
white
manna
obtained
by
drying
the
leaves
and
allowing
the
saccharine
matter
to
fall
off
and
the
green
the
result
of
steeping
the
leaves
in
water
which
is
afterwards
strained
there
is
a
product
much
like
golden
syrup
which
is
used
for
the
same
purposes
bitlis
is
one
of
the
roughest
and
most
fanatical
and
turbulent
of
turkish
cities
but
the
present
governor
raouf
pasha
is
a
man
of
energy
and
has
reduced
the
town
and
neighbourhood
to
some
degree
of
order
considerable
bodies
of
troops
have
been
brought
in
and
the
garrison
consists
of
men
these
soldiers
are
thoroughly
well
clothed
and
equipped
and
look
remarkably
clean
in
dress
and
person
they
are
cheery
men
and
their
presence
gives
a
little
confidence
to
the
christians
the
population
of
bitlis
is
estimated
at
of
which
number
over
are
kurds
both
men
and
women
are
very
handsome
and
the
striking
kurdish
costume
gives
a
great
brilliancy
and
picturesqueness
to
this
remarkable
city
the
short
sleeveless
jackets
of
sheepskin
with
the
black
wool
outside
which
the
men
are
now
wearing
over
their
striped
satin
vests
and
the
silver
rings
in
the
noses
of
the
girls
give
them
something
of
a
barbarian
look
and
indeed
their
habits
appear
to
be
much
the
same
as
those
of
their
karduchi
ancestors
in
the
days
of
xenophon
except
that
in
the
interval
they
have
become
moslems
and
teetotallers
here
they
are
sunnis
and
consequently
do
not
clash
with
their
neighbours
the
turks
who
abhor
the
kurds
of
the
mountains
as
kizilbashes
the
kurdish
is
very
fine
in
fact
i
have
never
seen
so
handsome
a
people
and
their
manly
and
highly
picturesque
costume
heightens
the
favourable
effect
produced
by
their
lithe
active
figures
the
cast
of
their
features
is
delicate
and
somewhat
sharp
the
mouth
is
small
and
well
formed
the
teeth
are
always
fine
and
white
the
face
is
oval
the
eyebrows
curved
and
heavy
the
eyelashes
long
the
eyes
deep
set
intelligent
and
roving
the
nose
either
straight
or
decidedly
aquiline
giving
a
expression
the
chin
slightly
receding
the
brow
broad
and
clear
the
hands
and
feet
remarkably
small
and
slender
the
women
when
young
are
beautiful
but
hard
work
and
early
maternity
lead
to
a
premature
loss
of
form
and
to
a
withered
angularity
of
feature
which
is
far
from
pleasing
and
which
as
they
do
not
veil
is
always
the
poorer
kurds
wear
woollen
socks
of
gay
and
elaborate
patterns
cotton
shoes
like
the
of
the
persians
camlet
trousers
wide
at
the
bottom
like
those
of
sailors
woollen
girdles
of
a
kashmir
shawl

short
jackets
and
felt
jerkins
without
sleeves
the
turban
usually
worn
is
peculiar
its
foundation
is
a
peaked

black
with
a
rope
of
silk
wool
or
cotton
wound
round
it
in
the

over
it
the

belt
is
usually
worn

are
crossed
over
the

also
carries
the
pipe
and
tobacco
pouch
a
long
knife
a
flint

and
in
some
cases
a

the
richer
kurds
dress
like
the
syrians
the
which
shows
considerably
at
the
chest
and
at
the
long
and
hanging
sleeves
is
of
striped
satin
either
crimson
and
white
or
in
a
combination
of
brilliant
colours
over
which
is
worn
a
short
jacket
of
cloth
or
silk
also
with
long
sleeves
the

richly
embroidered
in
gold

of

wide
at

loose
medieval

fastened
with
knobbed
clasps
of
silver
as
large
as

incrusted
with

round
which
they
wind
large
striped
silk
shawls
red
blue
orange
on
a
white
or
black
ground
with
long
fringed
ends
hanging
over
the
shoulders
and
floating
in
the
wind
as
they
gallop
and
in
their
girdles
they
carry
and
pistols
decorated
with
silver
knobs
besides
a
number
of
other
glittering
appointments
the
accoutrements
of
the
horses
are
in
keeping
and
at
marriages
and
other
festivities
the
bridles
and
are
completely
covered
with
pendent
silver
coins
the
dress
of
the
women
is
a
foil
to
that
of
their
lords
it
consists
of
a
blue
cotton
shirt
very
wide
trousers
drawn
in
at
the
ankles
a
silver
saucer
on
the
head
from
which
chains
depend
with
a
coin
at
the
end
of
each
a
square
mantle
hanging
down
the
back
clasped
by
two
of
its
corners
round
the
neck
and
many
strings
of
coins
round
the
throat
a
small
handkerchief
is
knotted
round
the
hair
and
in
presence
of
a
strange
man
they
hold
one
end
of
this
over
the
mouth
the
turks
in
bitlis
are
in
a
small
minority
and
the
number
of
armenian
christians
is
stated
at
from
to
the
old
church
has
a
large
monastery
outside
the
town
and
several
churches
and
schools
the
protestant
armenians
have
a
substantial
church
edifice
with
a
congregation
of
about
and
large
for
boys
and
girls
the
population
is
by
far
the
wildest
that
i
have
seen
in
any
asiatic
city
and
is
evidently
only
restrained
from
violence
by
the
large
garrison
it
is
not
safe
for
the
ladies
of
this
mission
to
descend
into
the
moslem
part
of
the
city
and
in
a
residence
of
more
than
twenty
years
they
have
never
even
passed
through
the
bazars
the
missionaries
occupy
a
restricted
and
uncertain
position
and
the
armenian
christians
are
subject
to
great
deprivations
and
restraints
and
are
distrusted
by
the
government
of
late
they
have
been
much
harassed
by
the
search
for
arms
and
christian
gunsmiths
have
been
arrested
even
their
funeral
ceremonies
are
not
exempt
from
the
presence
of
the
police
who
profess
to
believe
that
firearms
are
either
carried
in
the
place
of
a
corpse
or
are
concealed
along
with
it
placed
in
the
midst
of
a
preponderating
and
kurdish
population
capable
at
any
moment
of
being
excited
to
frenzy
against
their
faith
they
live
in
expectation
of
a
massacre
should
certain
events
take
place
which
are
regarded
as
probable
within
two
or
three
years
it
was
not
to
see
the
grandeur
and
picturesqueness
of
bitlis
that
i
came
here
so
late
in
the
season
but
to
visit
the
american
missionaries
especially
two
ladies
my
hosts
and
knapp
have
returned
from
a
visit
to
america
to
spend
their
last
days
in
a
country
which
has
been
their
home
for
thirty
years
and
have
lately
been
joined
by
their
son
who
spent
his
boyhood
in
bitlis
and
after
graduating
in
an
american
university
has
come
back
like
so
many
sons
of
missionaries
to
cast
in
his
lot
with
a
people
to
whom
he
is
bound
by
many
links
of
sympathy
bringing
his
wife
with
him
the
two
misses
who
are
more
than
half
english
and
are
highly
educated
and
accomplished
met
and
knapp
long
ago
in
a
steamer
on
the
mediterranean
and
decided
to
return
with
them
to
this
dangerous
and
outlandish
place
where
they
have
worked
among
the
women
and
girls
for
years
and
are
still
full
of
love
and
hope
the
school
for
girls
in
which
fifty
boarders
are
received
in
addition
to
fifty
day
pupils
has
a
department
attached
to
it
the
parents
of
all
are
expected
to
contribute
in
money
or
in
kind
but
their
increasing
poverty
is
telling
on
their
ability
to
do
so
and
this
winter
the
supply
of
food
contributed
by
them
is
far
short
of
the
mark
the
tastefulness
and
generosity
of
these
ladies
have
produced
as
bright
and
beautiful
a
schoolroom
as
could
be
found
anywhere
and
ivy
trained
round
the
windows
growing
plants
and
pictures
which
are
not
daubs
give
a
look
of
home
with
them
love
is
the
fulfilling
of
the
law
love
in
every
tone
look
and
touch
and
they
have
that
true
maternity
of
spirit
which
turns
a
school
into
a
family
and
trains
as
well
as
educates
they
are
now
educating
the
children
and
even
grandchildren
of
their
earliest
pupils
and
have
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
how
very
much
their
school
has
effected
in
permeating
the
household
and
social
relationships
of
the
armenian
women
with
the
tone
of
christian
discipleship
so
that
one
would
scarcely
hear
from
the
lips
of
any
of
their
married
pupils
the
provoking
question
we
are
only
women
what
can
we
do
many
of
them
have
gone
to
homes
in
the
roughest
and
wildest
of
mountain
villages
where
they
sweeten
village
life
by
the
gentle
and
kindly
ways
acquired
in
the
bitlis
school
these
ladies
conduct
a
mothers
meeting
and
i
thought
that
the
women
were
much
developed
in
intelligence
and
improved
in
manner
as
compared
with
the
usual
run
of
armenian
women
on
being
asked
to
address
them
i
took
their
own
words
for
my
text
we
are
only
women
and
found
them
intelligent
and
sympathetic
these
ladies
have
endured
great
hardships
and
their
present
position
is
one
of
continual
deprivation
and
frequent
risk
one
of
them
was
so
severely
stoned
in
bitlis
that
she
fell
unconscious
from
her
horse
in
the
winter
miss
itinerates
among
the
armenian
villages
of
the
mush
and
rahwan
plains
and
the
lake
shore
travelling
over
the
crust
of
the
enormously
deep
snow
in
a
drawn
by
a
man
braving
storms
which
have
nearly
cost
her
her
life
sleeping
and
living
for
a
month
or
more
at
a
time
chiefly
in
and
fearlessly
encountering
the
very
roughest
of
kurds
and
others
in
these
dim
and
crowded
stables
the
danger
of
village
expeditions
and
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
without
considerable
expense
have
increased
of
late
and
the
mush
plain
especially
has
been
ravaged
all
the
summer
and
autumn
by
the
kurds
with
many
barbarities
and
much
loss
of
life
so
that
travelling
for
christians
even
in
companies
has
been
dangerous
caravans
have
lately
been
attacked
and
robbed
and
in
the
case
of
one
large
mixed
caravan
the
christians
were
robbed
but
the
moslems
were
unmolested
a
traveller
was
recently
treacherously
murdered
by
his
and
miss
having
occasion
to
employ
the
same
men
a
few
days
ago
saw
and
heard
them
rehearse
his
dying
agonies
more
than
once
for
the
amusement
of
kurds
on
the
road
luxury
is
unknown
in
this
mission
house
it
is
so
small
that
in
order
to
receive
me
the
ladies
are
sleeping
in
a
curtained
recess
in
the
kitchen
and
the
for
the
natives
is
the
eating
and
living
room
of
the
family
among
them
all
there
is
a
rare
devotion
and
lives
spent
in
cheerful
obedience
to
god
and
in
loving
service
for
man
have
left
on
their
faces
the
impress
of
the
love
which
looks
kindly
and
the
wisdom
which
looks
soberly
on
all
things
the
mission
has
had
a
severe
struggle
the
life
on
this
mountain
slope
above
the
fanatical
city
is
a
very
restricted
one
there
is
nothing
of
what
we
are
accustomed
to
regard
as
necessary
recreation
and
a
traveller
is
not
seen
here
above
once
in
two
or
three
years
all
honour
to
those
who
have
courage
and
faith
to
live
such
a
life
so
lovingly
and
cheerfully
footnotes
it
does
not
present
any
difficulty
to
me
that
xenophon
omits
all
mention
of
the
lake
of
van
for
a
range
of
hills
lies
between
it
and
the
road
i
have
travelled
over
the
track
twice
and
failed
to
see
anything
in
the
configuration
of
the
country
which
would
have
led
me
to
suppose
that
the
region
to
the
eastward
was
anything
but
a
continuity
of
ranges
of
hills
and
mountains
and
if
the
ten
thousand
took
the
route
from
the
eastern
of
the
tigris
to
the
at
the
farther
end
of
the
plain
of
mush
directing
all
their
investigations
and
inquiries
in
a
westerly
direction
there
are
very
many
chances
against
their
having
been
informed
even
by
their
prisoners
of
the
existence
of
the
sea
of
van
iii
nor
stayed
till
on
niphates
top
he
lights
letter
xxxiii
pikhruz
i
was
indeed
sorry
to
leave
the
charming
circle
at
the
mission
house
and
the
wild
grandeur
of
bitlis
but
a
certain
wan
look
in
the
sky
and
peculiar
colouring
on
the
mountains
warned
my
friends
that
winter
might
set
in
any
day
and
reynolds
arranged
for
and
an
escort
and
obtained
a
letter
from
the
governor
by
means
of
which
i
can
procure
additional
in
case
of
need
my
turkish
moussa
is
rich
and
full
of
fun
and
jollity
he
sings
and
jokes
and
mimics
mirza
rides
a
fine
horse
or
sprawls
singing
on
its
back
and
keeps
every
one
alive
by
his
energy
and
vitality
my
loads
are
very
light
and
his
horses
are
strong
and
by
a
peculiar
screech
he
starts
them
off
at
a
canter
with
no
other
object
than
the
discomfiture
of
mirza
who
with
all
his
good
qualities
will
never
make
a
horseman
unluckily
he
has
a
caravan
of
forty
horses
laden
with
ammunition
for
the
government
on
the
road
so
things
may
not
be
always
so
smooth
as
they
are
now
descending
by
a
track
more
like
a
stair
than
a
road
and
crossing
the
tigris
my
friends
and
i
performed
the
feat
of
riding
through
some
of
the
bazars
even
though
knapp
and
i
had
been
pelted
with
stones
on
an
open
road
the
day
before
there
was
no
molestation
for
the
people
are
afraid
of
the
swords
bitlis
is
busy
and
it
is
difficult
to
get
through
its
crowded
markets
low
narrow
and
dark
as
they
are
the
sunbeams
rarely
entering
through
their
woven
roofs
the
stalls
were
piled
with
fruits
roots
strange
vegetables
red
cottons
gay
gear
for
horses
daggers
and
silver
chains
such
as
kurds
love
gay
kurdish
clothing
red
boots
with
toes
turned
up
for
tying
to
the
knees
english
cottons
mostly
red
and
pipes
of
all
kinds
there
was
pottery
in
red
and
green
huge
earthen
jars
for
the
storage
of
water
brooms
meat
curds
cheeses
and
everything
suited
to
the
needs
of
a
large
and
mixed
population
and
men
seated
in
the
shops
plied
their
curious
trades
emerging
into
the
full
sunlight
on
the
waggon
road
to
erzerum
we
met
strings
of
girls
carrying
on
their
backs
from
the
wells
and
long
trains
of
asses
and
bringing
in
produce
mixed
up
with
foot
passengers
and
kurds
on
showy
horses
bitlis
rejoices
in
abundant
streams
wells
fountains
and
mineral
springs
some
strongly
chalybeate
others
resembling
the
vichy
waters
the
grandly
picturesque
city
with
its
houses
its
barred
windows
suggestive
of
peril
its
colossal
ruins
its
abounding
waters
its
bridges
each
one
more
remarkable
than
the
other
its
terraced
and
wooded
heights
and
the
summits
which
tower
above
them
with
their
cool
blue
and
purple
shadows
disappeared
at
a
turn
of
the
road
and
there
too
my
friends
left
me
to
pursue
my
perilous
journey
alone
the
day
was
superb
and
full
of
fine
atmospheric
effects
as
we
crossed
the
rahwan
plain
the
great
mountains
to
the
west
were
enshrouded
in
wild
drifting
mists
through
which
now
and
then
peaks
and
ledges
white
with
recent
snow
revealed
themselves
to
be
hidden
in
blackness
the
next
moment
over
the
plain
the
blue
sky
was
vaulted
and
the
sun
shone
bright
and
warm
while
above
the
mountains
to
the
south
of
lake
van
white
clouds
were
piled
in
sunlit
masses
after
halting
at
tadvan
a
pleasant
village
among
streams
fountains
gardens
and
fruit
trees
we
skirted
the
lake
along
pleasant
cultivated
slopes
and
promontories
with
deep
bays
and
inlets
to
gudzag
where
i
spent
the
evening
in
an
retiring
to
sleep
in
my
small
tent
pitched
in
the
village
where
a
big
man
with
a
gun
and
wearing
a
cloak
of
goatskin
reaching
to
his
feet
kept
up
a
big
fire
and
guarded
me
till
morning
the
water
froze
in
my
basin
during
the
night
the
was
full
of
armenians
and
murphy
interpreted
their
innumerable
tales
of
wrong
and
robbery
since
the
erzerum
troubles
so
the
tales
ran
the
kurds
kill
men
as
if
they
were
partridges
on
asking
them
why
they
do
not
refuse
to
be
robbed
by
demand
they
replied
because
the
kurds
bring
big
sticks
and
beat
us
and
say
they
will
cut
our
throats
they
complained
of
the
exactions
of
the
and
of
being
tied
to
the
posts
of
their
houses
and
beaten
when
they
have
not
money
wherewith
to
pay
the
taxes
starting
at
sunrise
on
the
following
morning
i
had
a
very
pleasant
walk
along
the
sweet
shore
of
the
lake
while
water
sky
and
mountains
were
blended
in
a
flood
of
rose
and
gold
after
which
skirting
a
wooded
inlet
on
the
margin
of
which
the
brown
roofs
of
the
large
village
of
zarak
were
scarcely
seen
amidst
the
crimson
foliage
and
crossing
a
low
range
we
descended
upon
a
plain
at
the
head
of
a
broad
bay
on
the
farther
side
of
which
upon
a
level
breezy
height
rose
the
countless
monoliths
and
lofty
mausoleums
of
akhlat
which
i
had
made
a
long
detour
to
see
the
plain
is
abundantly
watered
and
its
springs
were
surrounded
with
green
sward
poplars
and
willows
while
it
was
enlivened
by
numerous
lumbering
and
creaking
on
their
slow
way
with
the
latest
sheaves
of
the
harvest
after
winding
up
a
deep
ravine
we
came
upon
a
great
table
of
rock
scarped
so
as
to
be
nearly
perpendicular
at
the
base
of
which
is
a
stone
village
on
the
other
side
is
a
fine
stream
i
had
purposed
to
spend
the
night
at
akhlat
but
on
riding
up
the
village
street
which
has
several
shops
there
was
a
manifest
unfriendliness
about
its
turkish
inhabitants
and
they
went
so
far
as
to
refuse
both
lodgings
and
supplies
so
i
only
halted
for
a
few
hours
few
things
have
pleased
me
more
than
akhlat
and
the
dreamy
loveliness
of
the
day
was
altogether
propitious
i
first
visited
the
or
ruined
city
the
table
rock
is
honeycombed
with
a
number
of
artificial
chambers
some
of
which
are
inhabited
several
of
these
are
carefully
arched
a
very
fine
one
consists
of
a
chamber
with
an
arched
recess
like
a
small
chancel
and
a
niche
so
resembling
a
piscina
at
one
side
that
one
involuntarily
looks
for
the
altar
these
dwellings
are
carefully
excavated
and
chisel
marks
are
visible
in
many
places
outlining
this
remarkable
rock
and
above
these
chambers
are
the
remains
of
what
must
have
been
a
very
fine
fortress
with
two
towers
like
those
of
the
castle
of
bitlis
springing
from
below
the
rock
the
whole
of
it
has
been
built
of
hewn
red
sandstone
the
walls
have
been
double
with
the
centre
filled
up
with
rough
stones
and
mortar
but
not
much
of
the
stone
facing
remains
the
villages
above
and
below
having
been
built
of
it
detached
pieces
of
masonry
such
as
great
masses
of
walls
solitary
arches
and
carved
fragments
extend
over
a
very
large
area
and
it
is
evident
that
investigators
with
time
and
money
might
yet
reap
a
rich
reward
excavators
have
been
recently
at
work
who
or
what
they
were
i
could
not
make
out
and
have
unearthed
among
other
objects
of
interest
a
temple
with
the
remains
of
a
dome
having
a
cornice
and
frieze
and
two
small
circular
chambers
much
decorated
the
whole
about
feet
long
akhlat
kalessi
or
the
castle
of
akhlat
stands
on
the
on
which
side
it
has
no
defences
it
is
a
fortress
with
massive
walls
with
round
and
square
towers
at
intervals
and
measures
about
paces
from
the
water
to
the
crest
of
the
slope
and
about
across
the
enclosure
which
is
entered
by
two
gates
contains
two
ancient
mosques
solidly
built
and
a
few
houses
among
fruit
trees
as
well
as
some
ruins
of
buildings
the
view
of
the
sipan
dagh
from
this
very
striking
ruin
is
magnificent
there
are
many
circassian
villages
on
the
skirts
of
the
sipan
dagh
and
their
inhabitants
bear
nearly
as
bad
a
reputation
as
that
of
the
kurds
they
are
well
armed
and
defy
the
local
government
they
are
robbers
and
pilferers
and
though
they
receive
or
did
receive
an
allowance
raised
by
a
tax
on
the
general
community
they
wring
what
they
please
out
of
the
people
among
whom
they
live
a
mile
from
akhlat
on
a
of
smooth
green
sward
high
above
the
silver
sea
facing
southwards
with
a
glorious
view
of
the
mountains
of
central
kurdistan
whitened
with
the
first
snows
of
winter
lies
in
an
indescribable
loneliness
the
city
of
the
dead
the
sward
is
covered
though
not
crowded
with
red
sandstone
monoliths
from
six
to
fourteen
feet
in
height
generally
in
excellent
preservation
each
has
a
projecting
cornice
on
the
east
side
with
carved
niches
and
the
western
face
is
covered
with
exquisite
tracery
in
arabesques
and
and
inscriptions
in
early
arabic
on
the
graves
are
either
three
carved
stones
arranged
on
edge
or
a
single
heavy
hewn
stone
with
a
rounded
top
and
sides
decorated
with
arabesques
few
of
these
beautiful
monoliths
have
fallen
but
some
are
much
and
have
a
growth
of
vivid
red
or
green
lichen
upon
them
besides
these
there
are
some
lofty
or
mausoleums
admirably
preserved
and
of
extreme
beauty
the
form
is
circular
the
sepulchre
is
a
closed
chamber
with
another
above
it
open
round
on
the
lake
side
and
a
colonnade
of
very
beautiful
pillars
supports
round
arches
above
which
are
five
friezes
the
whole
is
covered
with
a
conical
roof
of
carved
slabs
of
red
stone
under
which
runs
an
arabic
inscription
each
of
these
buildings
is
decorated
with
ornament
in
the
saracenic
style
of
a
richness
and
beauty
of
which
only
photography
could
give
any
adequate
representation
close
to
the
finest
of
these
is
an
old
mosque
with
a
entrance
over
which
is
a
recess
panelled
and
carved
like
one
in
the
finest
of
the
rock
chambers
the
lintels
of
the
door
are
decorated
with
stone
cables
mirza
counted
more
than
monoliths
as
i
sketched
the
finest
of
these
beautiful
mausoleums
some
came
up
and
objected
to
the
proceeding
and
moussa
urged
me
to
desist
as
the
remainder
of
the
march
was
very
dangerous
he
said
and
must
be
got
over
in
full
daylight
this
phrase
very
dangerous
as
used
in
armenia
means
that
there
is
a
serious
risk
of
having
the
baggage
and
horses
driven
off
and
the
men
stripped
to
a
single
garment
such
things
are
happening
constantly
and
even
moussa
ceases
his
joking
when
he
speaks
of
them
the
remaining
march
was
over
great
solitary
sweeps
of
breezy
upland
to
pikhruz
an
armenian
village
of
houses
which
has
an
intelligent
protestant
teacher
with
sixty
boys
in
his
school
the
villagers
possess
sheep
and
have
not
been
much
harassed
by
the
kurds
they
employ
kurdish
shepherds
and
four
night
watchmen
two
of
whom
are
kurds
the
of
the
women
are
heavy
with
coins
and
they
wear
stomachers
and
aprons
so
richly
embroidered
that
no
part
of
the
original
material
is
visible
the
is
an
exceptionally
bad
and
is
absolutely
crowded
with
horses
oxen
and
men
and
dim
with
the
fumes
of
animal
fuel
and
tobacco
it
is
indeed
comically
wretched
the
small
space
round
the
fire
is
so
crowded
with
and
villagers
that
i
have
scarcely
room
for
my
chair
and
the
ragamuffin
remains
of
my
baggage
murphy
is
crouching
over
a
fire
which
he
is
trying
to
fan
into
a
state
in
which
it
will
cook
my
unvarying
dinner
a
fowl
and
potatoes
moussa
is
as
usual
convulsing
the
company
with
his
stories
and
jokes
and
is
cracking
walnuts
for
me
the
schoolmaster
is
enlarging
to
me
on
that
fruitful
topic
the
state
of
things
the
sabres
and
rifles
of
my
escort
gleam
on
the
blackened
posts
the
delectable
ox
and
horse
faces
wear
a
look
of
content
as
they
munch
and
crunch
their
food
the
risk
of
sleeping
in
a
tent
is
discussed
and
meanwhile
i
write
spasmodically
with
the
candle
and
ink
on
a
board
on
my
lap
i
am
fast
coming
to
like
these
cheery
evenings
in
the
where
one
hears
the
news
of
the
country
and
villages
the
the
man
who
keeps
the
provides
fire
light
and
the
usual
country
diet
at
so
much
per
head
and
obtains
the
daily
fowl
which
costs
about
and
is
cooked
while
warm
milk
can
be
got
from
one
of
the
cows
in
the
stable
my
expenses
for
food
and
lodging
are
from
to
a
night
november
one
of
the
most
unpleasant
parts
of
the
routine
of
the
journey
is
the
return
to
the
at
after
a
night
in
the
fresh
air
for
the
atmosphere
is
so
heated
and
foul
as
almost
to
knock
one
down
the
night
frosts
are
sharp
and
as
we
start
before
sunrise
we
are
all
glad
to
walk
for
the
first
hour
the
night
in
my
tent
at
pikhruz
was
much
disturbed
and
i
realised
that
it
is
somewhat
risky
for
me
to
have
my
servants
out
of
hearing
in
the
depths
of
a
dwelling
the
village
dogs
raged
at
times
as
though
the
kurds
were
upon
them
and
every
the
village
guards
signalled
to
each
other
with
a
long
mournful
yell
i
was
awakened
once
by
a
confusion
of
diabolical
sounds
shots
shrieks
roars
and
yells
which
continued
for
some
time
and
then
died
away
in
the
morning
the
guards
said
that
the
kurds
had
attacked
a
large
caravan
on
the
plain
below
but
had
been
repulsed
and
that
men
on
both
sides
had
been
wounded
the
following
day
march
by
the
silver
sheet
of
the
kuzik
lake
alive
with
ducks
divers
and
other
water
fowl
was
very
charming
snow
had
fallen
heavily
and
the
sipan
dagh
and
the
nimrud
dagh
were
white
more
than
down
their
sides
from
the
summit
of
a
very
wild
pass
we
bade
adieu
to
the
beautiful
sea
of
van
crossed
a
plain
in
which
is
a
pretty
lake
with
several
villages
and
much
cultivation
on
its
margin
and
after
some
hours
of
solitary
mountain
travelling
came
down
upon
the
great
plain
of
norullak
sprinkled
with
large
villages
very
fertile
and
watered
by
the
the
eastern
branch
of
the
euphrates
i
was
to
have
had
an
easy
march
of
five
hours
and
to
have
spent
sunday
at
shaoub
in
the
comfortable
house
of
a
protestant
pastor
with
an
wife
but
the
took
the
wrong
road
and
as
twilight
came
on
it
was
found
that
shaoub
had
been
left
hours
behind
i
have
been
suffering
very
much
from
the
fatigue
of
the
very
long
marches
and
only
got
through
this
one
by
repeatedly
lying
down
by
the
roadside
while
the
went
in
search
of
information
after
it
was
quite
dark
and
we
were
still
astray
news
came
that
shaoub
was
occupied
by
turkish
soldiers
and
that
there
were
neither
supplies
nor
accommodation
and
after
two
more
hours
of
marching
and
over
ploughed
lands
and
among
irrigation
ditches
we
emerged
on
the
erzerum
road
six
inches
deep
in
dust
forded
a
river
in
thick
darkness
got
very
wet
and
came
out
upon
the
large
village
of
yangaloo
a
remarkable
collection
of
rather
than
houses
with
their
floors
considerably
below
the
ground
the
prospects
in
this
hummocky
place
were
most
unpromising
and
i
was
greeted
by
moussa
who
on
finding
that
shaoub
was
full
of
troops
had
had
the
wits
to
go
on
to
yangaloo
with
the
information
that
there
was
no
accommodation
a
womanly
christian
grip
of
my
arm
reassured
me
and
i
was
lodged
for
sunday
in
the
protestant
church
the
villagers
having
arranged
to
worship
elsewhere
a
building
forty
feet
long
with
small
windows
under
the
eaves
was
truly
luxurious
but
the
repose
of
sunday
morning
was
broken
by
loud
and
wearisome
noises
lasting
for
several
hours
which
received
a
distressing
explanation
i
was
informed
by
the
priests
and
several
of
the
leading
men
of
the
village
that
yangaloo
for
some
time
past
had
suffered
severely
from
the
kurds
and
that
just
before
a
heavy
demand
for
taxes
had
been
made
by
the
government
the
three
days
grace
usually
granted
having
been
refused
the
local
official
had
seized
the
flax
seed
their
most
profitable
crop
at
and
had
sold
it
for
full
price
his
perquisite
amounting
to
a
large
sum
fifteen
each
one
loaded
with
seven
large
sacks
of
linseed
were
removed
in
the
morning
the
people
were
very
friendly
all
the
brethren
and
sisters
came
to
kiss
hands
and
to
wish
that
my
departure
might
be
in
great
peace
and
on
sunday
evening
i
was
present
at
a
gathering
of
men
in
a
room
with
the
door
carefully
bolted
and
guarded
who
desired
me
to
convey
to
the
consul
at
erzerum
with
the
attestation
of
the
names
of
the
priests
of
the
old
and
reformed
churches
certain
complaints
and
narratives
of
wrong
which
represented
a
condition
of
living
not
to
be
thought
of
without
grief
and
indignation
and
not
to
be
ignored
because
it
is
partially
chronic
yangaloo
is
a
typical
armenian
village
its
dwellings
are
and
the
earth
which
has
been
excavated
is
piled
up
over
their
roofs
and
sides
the
interior
of
each
dwelling
covers
a
considerable
area
and
is
full
of
compartments
with
divisions
formed
by
low
clay
walls
or
by
the
posts
which
support
the
roof
the
compartments
ramifying
from
a
widening
at
the
inner
end
of
a
long
dark
passage
in
yangaloo
as
in
other
villages
on
the
plains
the
earth
is
so
piled
over
the
houses
as
to
render
them
hardly
distinguishable
from
the
surrounding
ground
but
where
a
village
burrows
into
a
only
a
small
projection
needs
an
artificial
roof
the
people
live
among
their
live
stock
one
entrance
serves
for
both
and
in
winter
time
the
animals
never
leave
the
stables
the
fireplace
or
is
in
the
floor
but
is
only
required
for
cooking
purposes
as
the
heat
and
steam
of
the
beasts
keep
the
human
beings
comfortably
warm
from
two
to
five
families
live
in
every
house
and
the
people
are
fairly
healthy
all
the
male
members
of
a
family
bring
their
brides
to
live
under
the
parental
roof
and
one
burrow
may
contain
as
many
as
three
generations
of
married
couples
with
their
families
on
becoming
an
inmate
of
her
house
each
armenian
bride
as
in
the
country
districts
of
persia
has
to
learn
the
necessity
of
silence
up
to
the
day
of
the
birth
of
the
first
child
she
is
the
family
drudge
and
may
not
speak
to
any
one
but
her
husband
and
not
to
him
in
the
presence
of
his
parents
maternity
liberates
her
tongue
she
may
talk
to
her
child
and
then
to
the
females
of
the
household
but
she
may
not
speak
freely
till
some
years
of
this
singular
novitiate
have
passed
by
she
then
takes
a
high
place
in
the
house
and
eventually
rules
it
if
she
is
left
a
widow
the
armenian
women
are
veiled
out
of
doors
but
only
in
deference
to
the
moslems
who
regard
an
uncovered
head
as
the
sign
of
a
bad
woman
the
girls
are
handsome
but
their
complexions
and
eyes
are
magnificent
sunday
was
windy
with
a
gray
sky
and
the
necessity
of
getting
over
the
ghazloo
pass
before
the
weather
absolutely
broke
was
urged
upon
me
by
all
on
the
plain
of
norullak
not
far
from
yangaloo
i
forded
the
euphrates
that
is
the
a
broad
still
and
deep
river
only
fordable
at
certain
seasons
the
fine
mountain
bijilan
is
a
landmark
in
this
part
of
the
country
leaving
the
euphrates
we
ascended
for
some
hours
through
bleak
uninteresting
regions
to
kara
kapru
and
on
the
road
passed
thirty
kurds
driving
a
number
of
asses
which
the
said
had
been
driven
off
from
two
christian
villages
which
they
pointed
out
i
was
interested
in
the
movements
of
some
mounted
men
who
hovered
suspiciously
about
my
caravan
and
at
one
time
galloped
close
up
to
it
but
retired
on
seeing
the
government
uniforms
and
were
apparently
loafing
about
among
the
valleys
the
said
that
they
were
notorious
robbers
and
would
not
go
home
without
booty
towards
evening
they
reappeared
with
several
bullocks
and
asses
which
they
had
driven
off
from
the
village
of
the
headman
of
which
came
to
me
in
the
evening
and
asked
me
to
report
the
robbery
to
the
consul
adding
that
this
was
the
third
time
within
a
week
that
his
village
had
been
robbed
of
domestic
animals
and
that
he
dared
not
complain
at
kara
kapru
the
armenian
village
i
have
seen
while
i
was
looking
for
an
moussa
in
spite
of
murphy
and
the
dashed
off
with
his
horses
at
full
speed
and
never
stopped
till
he
reached
ghazloo
three
hours
farther
on
this
barbarous
conduct
was
occasioned
by
his
having
heard
that
two
of
his
forty
horses
ahead
had
broken
down
and
he
hurried
on
to
replace
them
with
two
of
mine
i
was
so
tired
and
in
so
much
pain
that
i
was
obliged
to
lie
down
on
the
roadside
for
a
considerable
time
before
i
could
proceed
and
got
a
chill
and
was
so
wretched
that
i
had
to
be
tied
on
my
horse
it
was
pitch
dark
the
continually
lost
the
way
heavy
rain
came
on
and
it
was
when
we
reached
ghazloo
a
village
high
up
on
a
where
mirza
and
murphy
carried
me
into
a
small
and
crowded
stable
and
later
into
my
tent
which
was
pitched
in
the
slime
at
the
stable
door
moussa
was
repentant
borrowed
a
and
said
he
would
give
me
his
strong
horse
for
nothing
torrents
of
rain
fell
changing
into
sleet
and
sleet
into
snow
and
when
the
following
day
dawned
dismally
my
tent
was
soaked
and
standing
in
slush
and
snow
my
bed
was
carried
into
the
stable
and
i
rested
while
the
loading
was
going
on
suleiman
my
special
said
that
the
was
quadrupling
the
charges
and
wanted
me
not
to
pay
him
anything
the
retorted
that
i
gave
the
money
to
pay
and
that
he
gave
only
a
few
coppers
to
the
people
a
glaring
untruth
for
murphy
pays
everything
in
my
presence
thereupon
suleiman
beat
the
with
his
scabbarded
sword
on
which
the
man
struck
him
and
there
was
a
severe
fight
in
the
course
of
which
the
combatants
fell
over
the
end
of
my
bed
so
habituated
does
one
become
to
scenes
of
violence
in
this
country
that
i
scarcely
troubled
myself
to
say
to
murphy
tell
them
to
fight
outside
it
was
a
severe
day
march
over
the
bingol
dagh
and
i
know
little
about
the
country
we
passed
through
we
skirted
a
bleak
snowy
hillside
first
in
rain
and
then
in
a
heavy
snowstorm
made
a
long
ascent
among
drifting
snow
clouds
saw
an
ass
abandoned
by
a
caravan
shivering
in
the
bitter
wind
with
three
magpies
on
its
back
picking
its
bleeding
wounds
and
near
the
summit
of
the
ghazloo
pass
encountered
a
very
severe
blizzard
so
severe
that
no
caravan
but
my
own
attempted
to
face
it
and
sixty
conscripts
for
bitlis
in
charge
of
two
officers
and
some
cavalry
turned
back
in
spite
of
words
and
blows
saying
we
may
be
shot
better
that
than
to
die
on
the
hillside
poor
fellows
they
are
wretchedly
dressed
and
many
of
them
have
no
socks
the
blizzard
was
very
awful
a
horror
of
great
darkness
a
bewildering
whirl
of
snow
coming
from
all
quarters
at
once
a
hurricane
of
icy
wind
so
fearful
that
i
had
to
hold
on
by
the
crupper
and
mane
to
avoid
being
blown
out
of
the
saddle
utter
confusion
a
deadly
grip
at
my
heart
everything
blotted
out
and
a
sense
of
utter
helplessness
indeed
i
know
of
no
peril
in
which
human
resources
count
for
so
little
after
reaching
the
summit
of
the
pass
the
risk
was
over
but
we
were
seriously
delayed
in
forcing
a
passage
through
the
drift
which
was
fully
seven
feet
deep
the
men
were
much
exhausted
and
they
say
that
half
an
hour
of
it
would
have
finished
them
all
landmarks
were
lost
in
the
storm
and
after
some
hours
of
struggling
through
snow
and
repeatedly
losing
the
way
the
early
darkness
compelled
us
to
take
refuge
in
a
kurdish
village
of
bad
repute
on
a
bleak
mountain
side
the
was
not
only
the
worst
i
have
yet
seen
but
it
was
crammed
with
handsome
kurds
and
with
the
conscripts
who
had
turned
back
at
the
pass
some
of
whom
were
suffering
from
fever
and
with
cavalrymen
and
their
horses
every
man
trying
to
get
near
the
fire
i
can
not
say
that
any
of
them
were
rude
indeed
the
kurds
did
their
best
for
what
they
supposed
to
be
my
comfort
i
spent
the
evening
among
them
but
slept
in
my
tent
outside
in
two
feet
of
snow
yards
from
the
stable
in
spite
of
the
protestations
of
the
in
fact
i
trusted
to
kurdish
watchmen
who
turned
out
faithful
and
when
an
attempt
was
made
to
rob
my
tent
in
the
night
they
sprang
on
the
robbers
and
after
a
struggle
got
two
of
them
down
and
beat
them
with
their
guns
both
sides
yelling
like
savages
when
i
left
the
for
the
tent
two
kurds
gripped
my
arms
and
led
me
to
it
through
the
deep
snow
it
was
better
to
run
some
risk
than
to
be
suffocated
by
the
heat
and
overpowering
odours
of
the
stable
but
it
was
an
eerie
place
the
weather
considerably
delayed
my
farther
progress
the
days
were
severe
and
the
nights
were
spent
in
a
soaked
tent
pitched
in
slush
or
snow
mist
and
snow
concealed
the
country
and
few
travellers
were
stirring
we
marched
with
the
powder
caravan
for
the
sake
of
the
escort
and
for
its
services
in
beating
the
track
and
moussa
and
his
men
watched
at
night
the
going
was
very
bad
and
both
moussa
and
i
fell
down
hill
slopes
with
our
horses
but
the
animals
luckily
alighted
on
their
feet
moussa
jollity
was
very
useful
he
is
a
capital
mimic
and
used
to
take
off
mirza
in
the
at
night
and
as
murphy
lost
no
opportunity
of
showing
up
the
poor
fellow
want
of
travelling
he
would
have
had
a
bad
time
but
for
his
philosophical
temperament
and
imperturbable
i
suffered
very
much
from
my
spine
but
the
men
were
all
kind
and
tried
to
make
things
easy
for
me
and
the
were
attentive
and
obliging
kurdistan
is
scarcely
a
geographical
expression
and
colloquially
the
word
is
used
to
cover
the
country
inhabited
by
the
kurds
they
are
a
mysterious
people
having
maintained
themselves
in
their
original
seats
and
in
a
condition
of
through
all
the
changes
which
have
passed
over
western
asia
though
they
do
not
exceed
numerically
two
and
a
quarter
millions
of
souls
such
as
they
were
when
they
opposed
the
retreat
of
the
ten
thousand
they
seem
to
be
still
war
and
robbery
are
the
business
of
kurdish
life
illustration
a
hakkiari
kurd
one
great
interest
of
this
journey
is
that
it
lies
through
a
country
in
which
kurds
turks
and
armenians
live
alongside
each
other
the
kurds
being
of
two
classes
the
tribal
who
are
chiefly
nomads
owning
no
law
but
the
right
of
the
strongest
and
the
or
settled
who
having
been
conquered
by
turkey
are
fairly
orderly
and
are
peaceable
except
in
their
relations
with
the
christians
the
strongholds
of
the
tribal
kurds
are
in
the
wild
mountains
of
kurdistan
and
especially
in
the
hakkiari
country
which
is
sprinkled
with
their
rude
castles
and
forts
an
incurable
love
of
plunder
a
singular
aptitude
for
religious
fanaticism
a
recklessness
as
to
the
spilling
of
blood
a
universal
rapacity
and
a
cruel
brutality
when
their
passions
are
roused
are
among
their
chief
vices
the
men
are
bold
sober
and
devoted
to
their
kinsmen
and
tribe
and
the
women
are
chaste
industrious
and
maternal
under
a
firm
and
equitable
government
asserting
vigorously
and
persistently
the
supremacy
of
law
and
the
equal
rights
of
race
and
creed
they
would
probably
develop
into
excellent
material
the
village
turk
as
he
is
described
by
europeans
well
acquainted
with
him
and
speaking
his
language
and
as
i
have
seen
him
on
a
long
journey
is
a
manly
hospitable
kindly
fairly
honest
fellow
domestic
cheerful
patriotic
kind
to
animals
usually
a
monogamist
and
usually
also
attentive
to
his
religious
duties
the
christians
who
in
this
part
of
kurdistan
are
all
armenians
by
race
live
chiefly
on
the
plains
and
in
the
lower
folds
of
the
hills
and
are
engaged
in
pastoral
and
agricultural
pursuits
my
letters
have
given
a
faithful
representation
of
them
as
dwelling
with
their
animals
in
dark
hovels
the
men
are
industrious
thrifty
clannish
domestic
and
not
given
to
vices
except
that
of
intoxication
when
they
have
the
means
and
opportunity
and
the
women
are
hardworking
and
chaste
both
sexes
are
dirty
hardy
avaricious
and
superstitious
and
ages
of
wrong
have
developed
in
them
some
of
the
usual
faults
of
oppressed
oriental
peoples
they
cling
desperately
to
their
historic
church
which
is
represented
among
the
peasants
by
priests
scarcely
less
ignorant
than
themselves
their
bishops
constitute
their
only
aristocracy
they
are
grossly
ignorant
and
of
the
world
which
lies
outside
the
in
which
they
live
they
know
nothing
the
sultan
is
to
them
a
splendid
myth
to
whom
they
owe
and
are
ready
to
pay
a
loyal
allegiance
government
is
represented
to
them
by
the
and
his
brutalities
of
justice
the
most
priceless
product
of
good
government
they
know
nothing
but
that
it
is
a
marketable
commodity
with
the
armenian
trading
communities
of
the
cities
they
have
slender
communication
and
little
except
nationality
and
religion
in
common
as
a
rule
they
live
in
villages
by
themselves
which
cluster
round
churches
more
or
less
distinguishable
from
the
surrounding
hovels
but
there
are
also
mixed
villages
in
which
turks
and
armenians
live
side
by
side
and
in
these
cases
they
get
on
fairly
well
together
though
they
instinctively
dislike
each
other
and
the
turk
despises
his
neighbour
both
for
his
race
and
creed
the
armenians
have
not
complained
of
being
maltreated
by
the
turkish
peasants
and
had
there
been
any
cause
for
complaint
it
would
certainly
have
reached
my
ears
on
this
journey
hundreds
of
stories
have
been
told
to
me
by
priests
of
both
the
old
and
protestant
churches
headmen
and
others
of
robbery
by
demand
outrages
on
women
digging
into
houses
killing
collectively
and
individually
driving
off
sheep
and
cattle
etc
on
the
whole
the
same
condition
of
alarm
prevails
among
the
armenians
as
i
witnessed
previously
among
the
syrian
it
is
more
than
alarm
it
is
and
not
without
good
reason
in
plain
english
general
lawlessness
prevails
over
much
of
this
region
caravans
are
stopped
and
robbed
travelling
is
for
armenians
absolutely
unsafe
sheep
and
cattle
are
being
driven
off
and
outrages
which
it
would
be
inexpedient
to
narrate
are
being
perpetrated
nearly
all
the
villages
have
been
reduced
to
extreme
poverty
by
the
carrying
off
of
their
domestic
animals
the
pillage
and
in
some
cases
the
burning
of
their
crops
and
the
demands
made
upon
them
at
the
sword
point
for
every
article
of
value
which
they
possess
while
at
the
same
time
they
are
squeezed
for
the
taxes
which
the
kurds
have
left
them
without
the
means
of
paying
the
repressive
measures
which
have
everywhere
followed
the
erzerum
troubles
of
last
june
the
seizure
of
arms
the
unchecked
ravages
of
the
kurds
the
threats
of
the
kurdish
beys
who
are
boldly
claiming
the
sanction
of
the
government
for
their
outrages
the
insecurity
of
the
women
and
a
dread
of
yet
worse
to
come
have
reduced
these
peasants
to
a
pitiable
state
the
invariable
and
reasonable
complaint
made
by
the
christians
is
that
though
they
are
heavily
taxed
they
have
no
protection
from
the
kurds
or
any
advantage
from
the
law
as
administered
in
kurdistan
and
that
taxes
are
demanded
from
them
which
the
kurds
have
left
them
without
the
means
of
paying
they
complain
that
they
are
brutally
beaten
when
they
fail
to
produce
money
for
the
payment
of
the
government
imposts
and
they
allege
with
great
unanimity
that
it
is
common
for
the
to
tie
their
hands
behind
them
to
plaster
their
faces
with
fresh
and
throw
pails
of
cold
water
at
their
eyes
tie
them
to
the
posts
of
their
houses
and
flog
them
severely
in
the
village
of
which
has
been
swept
bare
by
the
kurds
the
people
asserted
that
the
had
tied
twenty
defaulters
together
and
had
driven
them
round
and
round
barefooted
over
the
thistles
of
the
flogging
them
with
their
heavy
whips
my
complain
of
the
necessity
they
are
under
of
beating
the
people
they
say
and
i
think
correctly
that
they
can
never
know
whether
a
man
has
a
hoard
of
buried
money
or
not
without
beating
him
they
tell
me
also
that
they
know
that
half
the
peasants
have
nothing
to
pay
their
taxes
with
but
that
unless
they
beat
them
to
get
what
they
can
out
of
them
they
would
be
punished
themselves
for
neglect
of
duty
on
the
plains
to
the
west
and
of
the
lake
of
van
where
the
deep
almost
subsoil
ploughing
and
irrigation
channels
testify
to
the
industry
of
a
thrifty
population
great
depredations
are
even
now
being
committed
and
though
later
the
intense
cold
and
tremendous
depths
of
snow
of
the
armenian
highlands
will
proclaim
the
truce
of
god
the
kurds
are
still
on
the
alert
nor
are
their
outrages
confined
to
small
localities
neither
are
they
the
result
of
peculiar
local
circumstances
but
from
the
persian
frontier
near
urmi
along
a
more
or
less
travelled
road
of
several
hundred
miles
there
is
generally
speaking
no
security
for
life
traffic
or
property
and
i
hear
on
good
authority
that
on
the
other
side
of
erzerum
even
up
to
the
russian
frontier
things
are
if
possible
worse
i
have
myself
seen
enough
to
convince
me
that
in
the
main
the
statements
of
the
people
represent
accurately
enough
the
present
reign
of
terror
in
armenia
and
that
a
state
of
matters
nearly
approaching
anarchy
is
now
existing
in
the
of
erzerum
there
is
no
security
at
all
for
the
lives
and
property
of
christians
law
is
being
violated
daily
and
almost
with
perfect
impunity
and
peaceable
and
industrious
subjects
of
the
porte
taxed
to
an
extent
which
should
secure
them
complete
protection
are
plundered
without
redress
their
feeble
complaints
are
ignored
or
are
treated
as
evidence
of
insurrectionary
tendencies
and
even
their
lives
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
increased
audacity
and
aroused
fanaticism
of
the
kurds
and
this
not
in
nearly
inaccessible
and
mountain
valleys
but
on
the
broad
plains
of
armenia
with
telegraph
wires
above
and
passable
roads
below
and
with
a
and
the
fourth
army
corps
numbering
seasoned
troops
within
easy
distance
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
in
the
long
winter
evenings
which
i
have
spent
in
these
sociable
the
peasants
have
talked
to
me
freely
and
frankly
there
are
no
reasons
why
it
should
be
otherwise
for
my
are
seldom
present
moussa
is
looking
after
his
horses
in
distant
recesses
quite
out
of
hearing
and
my
servants
are
christians
if
the
people
speak
frankly
i
am
compelled
to
believe
that
the
armenian
peasant
is
as
destitute
of
political
aspirations
as
he
is
ignorant
of
political
grievances
that
if
he
were
secured
from
the
ravages
of
moslem
marauders
he
would
be
as
contented
as
he
is
loyal
and
industrious
and
that
his
one
desire
is
protection
from
the
kurds
and
from
the
rapacity
of
minor
officials
with
security
for
his
life
and
property
not
on
a
single
occasion
have
i
heard
a
wish
expressed
for
political
or
administrative
reform
or
for
autonomy
the
armenian
peasants
are
of
the
earth
earthy
and
the
unmolested
enjoyment
of
material
good
is
their
idea
of
an
earthly
paradise
with
regard
to
the
kurds
they
have
been
remorseless
robbers
for
ages
and
as
their
creed
scarcely
hesitates
to
give
the
appropriation
of
the
goods
of
a
a
place
among
the
virtues
they
prey
upon
the
syrian
and
armenian
peasants
with
clear
consciences
to
rob
them
by
violence
and
demand
month
after
month
and
year
after
year
till
they
have
stripped
them
nearly
bare
to
cut
their
throats
if
they
resist
to
leave
them
for
a
while
to
retrieve
their
fortunes
let
the
sheep
wool
as
their
phrase
is
and
then
to
rob
them
again
is
the
simple
story
of
the
relations
between
kurd
and
christian
they
are
well
armed
with
modern
rifles
and
revolvers
i
have
rarely
seen
a
kurd
with
an
weapon
and
i
have
seen
a
christian
with
a
rifle
and
their
nearly
useless
long
guns
have
lately
been
seized
by
the
government
the
kurds
hate
and
despise
the
turks
their
nominal
rulers
but
the
islamic
bond
of
brotherhood
is
stronger
than
the
repulsion
either
of
hatred
or
contempt
and
the
latent
or
undisguised
sympathy
of
their
in
official
positions
ensures
them
for
the
most
part
immunity
for
their
crimes
for
the
new
code
under
which
the
evidence
of
a
christian
has
become
nominally
admissible
in
a
court
of
law
being
in
direct
opposition
to
the
teaching
of
the
koran
to
the
practice
of
centuries
to
kurdish
fanaticism
and
to
the
strong
religious
feelings
and
prejudices
of
those
who
administer
justice
is
practically
so
far
as
the
christians
are
concerned
a
dead
letter
i
am
writing
in
an
in
the
village
of
harta
after
a
wild
mountain
ride
in
wind
sleet
and
snow
the
very
long
marches
on
this
journey
have
been
too
much
for
me
and
i
made
a
first
and
last
attempt
to
travel
in
a
or
covered
wooden
pannier
but
the
suffering
was
so
great
that
i
was
glad
to
remount
my
faithful
woolly
we
had
a
regular
snowstorm
in
which
nothing
could
be
seen
but
the
baggage
horses
struggling
and
falling
and
occasional
glimpses
of
caverned
limestone
cliffs
and
precipitous
slopes
with
a
foamy
torrent
at
a
tremendous
depth
below
on
emerging
from
the
pass
moussa
suleiman
and
i
came
at
a
good
pace
through
the
slush
to
this
and
i
arrived
so
cold
that
i
was
glad
to
have
to
rub
my
horse
dry
and
attend
to
him
murphy
describes
him
thus
that
a
strange
horse
of
yours
if
one
were
to
lie
down
among
his
legs
he
take
no
notice
to
hurt
one
when
he
comes
in
he
just
fills
hisself
then
he
lies
down
in
the
wettest
place
he
can
find
and
goes
to
sleep
then
he
wakes
and
shakes
hisself
and
hollers
he
does
till
he
gets
his
grub
an
inelegant
but
forcible
description
of
the
excellences
of
a
travelling
horse
is
truly
a
gentle
pet
it
afflicts
me
sorely
to
part
with
him
a
few
nights
ago
as
i
took
some
raisins
to
him
in
a
dark
recess
of
the
stable
my
light
went
out
and
i
slipped
and
fell
among
the
legs
of
some
animal
not
knowing
whether
it
was
a
buffalo
or
a
strange
horse
i
did
not
dare
to
move
and
said
is
this
you
my
sweet
a
low
pleasant
snuffle
answered
yes
and
i
pulled
myself
up
by
the
strong
woolly
legs
which
have
carried
me
so
sturdily
and
bravely
for
several
hundred
miles
the
christians
appear
not
to
have
anything
analogous
to
our
family
worship
but
are
careful
in
their
attendance
at
the
daily
prayers
in
church
to
which
they
are
summoned
before
dawn
either
by
loud
rappings
on
their
doors
or
the
striking
of
a
wooden
gong
or
the
churches
differ
very
little
they
usually
have
an
attempt
at
an
outer
courtyard
the
interior
of
the
edifice
is
generally
square
the
roof
is
supported
by
two
rows
of
poplar
pillars
and
the
rough
walls
are
concealed
by
coarse
pictures
and
dirty
torn
strips
of
printed
cotton
dirty
mats
or
bits
of
carpets
cover
the
floor
racks
are
provided
for
the
shoes
of
the
worshippers
and
if
there
is
not
a
gallery
a
space
is
railed
off
for
the
women
the
prayers
are
mumbled
by
priests
in
dirty
vestments
while
the
women
knit
and
chatter
dust
and
dirt
abound
there
is
such
an
air
of
indifference
about
priests
and
people
that
one
asks
what
motive
it
is
which
impels
them
to
leave
their
warm
stable
dwellings
on
these
winter
mornings
to
shiver
in
a
dark
and
chilly
church
they
say
we
will
tread
the
paths
our
fathers
trod
they
are
quite
good
enough
for
us
two
nights
ago
in
an
full
of
men
the
kurdish
at
the
canonical
hour
fell
down
on
his
forehead
at
prayer

the
midst

was

xenophon

the

dwellings
of
his

thus
their

were
underground
the
entrance
like
the

have
understood
that

still
exists
in

it
is
not
unlikely
that
the

is

are
ancient
cellars
anterior
to
the

accuracy
of

though
many
of
them
appeared
to
be
established
by
a
mass
of
concurrent
and
respectable
testimony
i
forbear
presenting
any
of
them
to
my
readers
especially
as
the
report
presented
to
parliament
in
january
no
not
only
gives
on
british
official
authority
a
mass
of
investigated
facts
but
states
the
case
of
the
armenian
peasantry
in
language
far
stronger
than
any
that
i
should
have
ventured
to
use
in
a
minute
by

no
the
condition
of
the
christian
peasant
population
of
kurdistan
is
summarised
thus
their
sufferings
at
present
proceed
from
three
distinct
causes
the
insecurity
of
their
lives
and
properties
owing
to
the
habitual
ravages
of
the
kurds
the
insecurity
of
their
persons
and
the
absence
of
all
liberty
of
thought
and
action
except
the
exercise
of
public
worship
the
unequal
status
held
by
the
christian
as
compared
with
the
mussulman
in
the
eyes
of
the
government
letter
xxxiv
erzerum
i
left
harta
in
a
snowstorm
without
the
caravan
and
wherever
the
snow
was
well
beaten
got
along
at
a
good
pace
passing
on
the
right
the
fortress
of
with
several
lines
of
fortifications
and
a
town
at
its
base
which
with
the
surrounding
district
consumes
it
is
said
an
amount
of
strong
drink
equal
in
value
to
its
taxation
the
adjacent
pasin
plain
watered
by
the
araxes
has
suffered
severely
from
the
kurds
a
short
time
ago
all
its
christian
villages
were
plundered
and
horses
asses
sheep
and
head
of
cattle
nearly
the
whole
pastoral
wealth
of
the
people
were
carried
off
by
these
marauders
while
the
moslem
villages
were
exempt
from
their
attacks
after
winding
among
uninteresting
hills
crowned
with
forts
along
valleys
in
which
military
posts
occur
at
frequent
intervals
and
making
a
long
ascent
the
minarets
and
grim
fortifications
of
the
unhappy
town
of
erzerum
loomed
through
the
the
city
itself
lying
on
a
hill
slope
above
a
very
extensive
plain
at
a
height
of
over
feet
it
was
a
solemn
scene
the
snow
was
deep
and
was
still
falling
the
heavens
were
black
and
swirls
of
mist
driven
by
a
strong
wind
blotted
out
at
times
the
surrounding
mountains
a
dead
calm
followed
and
snow
clouds
hung
suspended
over
the
city
my
first
impression
of
erzerum
was
of
earthworks
of
immense
size
extending
for
miles
with
dismounted
guns
upon
them
looking
very
black
in
the
snow
of
a
deep
ditch
and
a
lofty
rampart
pierced
by
a
fine
granite
tunnel
of
more
earthworks
and
of
forts
crowning
all
the
heights
directly
above
the
city
and
of
many
flags
drooping
on
their
staffs
between
the
fortifications
and
the
town
there
is
a
great
deal
of
open
ground
sprinkled
with
rifle
pits
powder
magazines
and
artillery
cavalry
and
infantry
barracks
very
solidly
built
and
neatly
kept
up
after
passing
through
cemeteries
containing
thousands
of
gravestones
we
abruptly
entered
the
principal
street
wide
and
somewhat
in
which
are
some
of
the
consulates
and
the
protestant
armenian
church
and
schools
the
houses
in
this
street
are
very
irregular
and
most
of
them
have
projecting
upper
fronts
i
was
received
with
the
utmost
kindness
at
the
american
mission
house
where
it
has
seemed
likely
that
i
might
be
detained
for
the
winter
i
understood
that
when
i
reached
erzerum
i
should
be
able
to
drive
to
trebizond
in
a
so
i
sent
murphy
to
van
on
and
thought
with
much
satisfaction
of
the
ease
of
the
coming
journey
then
i
was
ill
and
afterwards
found
that
the
were
long
rough
waggons
without
springs
in
which
one
must
lie
or
sit
on
the
top
of
the
baggage
and
that
i
should
never
be
able
to
bear
the
jolting
there
was
another
heavy
snowstorm
and
winter
set
in
so
rigorously
that
it
was
decided
that
driving
was
out
of
the
question
and
that
i
must
hire
a
horse
after
the
matter
had
been
settled
thus
murphy
and
both
in
very
bad
case
were
found
in
a
low
part
of
the
town
and
though
murphy
asserts
that
he
encountered
kurds
near
who
robbed
him
of
everything
it
is
not
believed
that
he
ever
passed
through
the
city
gate
he
looks
a
pitiable
object
and
his
uniform
and
the
blanket
revolver
and
other
things
that
i
had
given
him
are
all
gone
in
spite
of
his
fatal
failing
i
have
him
and
shall
again
ride
my
trusty
pet
the
vali
ignoring
my
official
letter
has
insisted
on
a
number
of
formalities
being
complied
with
and
though
the
has
undertaken
all
the
formal
arrangements
the
delays
have
been
many
and
tiresome
there
are
two
bugbears
on
the
trebizond
road
the
kop
and
zigana
mountains
which
are
liable
to
be
blocked
by
snow
as
compared
with
persian
towns
erzerum
looks
solid
and
handsome
and
its
uncovered
bazars
seem
fairly
busy
the
through
traffic
between
trebizond
and
tabriz
chiefly
in
british
goods
is
very
heavy
the
custom
house
is
in
sight
from
my
windows
and
in
one
day
i
have
counted
as
many
as
laden
camels
passing
through
it
besides
horse
and
mule
caravans
there
are
about
persians
in
the
city
and
the
carrying
trade
is
mainly
in
their
hands
the
present
population
is
estimated
at
from
to
the
armenians
are
not
very
numerous
but
their
enterprise
as
traders
gives
them
an
importance
out
of
proportion
to
their
numbers
the
armenian
cathedral
the
pair
of
minarets
the
single
minaret
and
the
castle
which
stands
on
a
height
in
the
middle
of
the
city
and
contains
a
small
saracenic
chapel
are
the
chief
sights
nothing
is
talked
about
but
the
troubles
and
the
european
consuls
who
possess
trustworthy
information
confirm
my
impressions
of
the
seriousness
of
the
present
latitude
allowed
to
the
kurds
the
turkish
government
has
just
taken
a
step
which
is
regarded
as
full
of
hazard
certain
kurdish
beys
were
summoned
to
erzerum
nominally
for
the
purpose
of
being
reprimanded
for
their
misdeeds
but
they
were
allowed
to
enter
the
gates
with
a
number
of
armed
followers
and
afterwards
went
to
erzingian
where
from
the
hands
of
zeki
pacha
the
commander
of
the
fourth
army
corps
they
received
commissions
as
officers
of
irregulars
the
christians
but
i
hope
erroneously
regard
this
step
as
a
menace
and
the
kurds
appear
to
think
that
it
gives
them
license
to
maraud
these
beys
after
receiving
their
commissions
went
through
the
christian
quarter
of
the
erzingian
bazars
making
gestures
as
of
cutting
throats
and
saying
to
the
christian
merchants
your
time
has
come
now
hitherto
we
have
not
had
the
of
the
government
but
we
have
it
now
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
the
porte
will
succeed
in
bringing
these
men
and
their
wild
followers
under
the
conditions
of
military
discipline
the
excitement
following
upon
the
troubles
last
june
has
only
partially
subsided
and
i
learn
from
the
europeans
that
the
state
of
suspicion
fear
distrust
and
repression
within
the
city
has
undergone
little
diminution
every
day
brings
fresh
reports
of
robbery
and
outrage
and
for
murders
of
christians
no
arrests
are
being
made
trade
among
the
armenians
is
suffering
for
those
merchants
whose
transactions
are
with
kurdish
districts
dare
not
collect
their
debts
for
fear
of
losing
their
lives
arrests
of
christians
on
frivolous
and
worthless
pretexts
are
being
made
daily
armenian
houses
are
being
searched
continually
and
individuals
are
being
imprisoned
for
long
terms
of
years
for
having
books
in
their
possession
containing
references
to
the
past
history
of
armenia
and
the
government
is
or
affects
to
be
in
constant
dread
of
an
insurrectionary
rising
among
the
christians
the
accounts
from
the
country
districts
are
so
very
bad
that
one
of
the
ablest
and
of
the
european
consuls
a
very
old
resident
in
asia
minor
remarked
indignantly
it
no
longer
a
question
of
politics
but
of
humanity
one
of
the
most
interesting
sights
in
erzerum
is
the
sanassarian
college
founded
and
handsomely
endowed
by
the
liberality
of
an
armenian
merchant
the
fine
buildings
are
of
the
best
construction
and
are
admirably
suited
for
educational
purposes
and
the
equipments
are
of
the
latest
and
most
complete
description
the
education
and
the
moral
and
intellectual
training
are
of
a
very
high
type
and
the
personal
influence
of
the
three
directors
who
were
educated
in
germany
and
england
altogether
makes
for
righteousness
the
graduation
course
is
nine
years
the
students
numbering
wear
a
uniform
and
there
is
no
distinction
of
class
among
them
they
are
almost
without
exception
manly
earnest
and
studious
and
are
full
of
enthusiasm
and
de
much
may
be
hoped
for
in
the
future
from
the
admirable
moral
training
and
thorough
education
given
in
this
college
which
is
one
of
the
few
bright
spots
in
armenia
i
have
seen
erzerum
under
very
favourable
circumstances
for
since
the
last
snowstorm
the
weather
has
been
magnificent
and
everything
that
is
untidy
or
unsightly
has
an
unsullied
covering
the
winter
sunsets
reddening
the
white
summits
of
the
deveh
boyun
and
other
lofty
ranges
and
the
absolute
purity
of
the
whiteness
of
the
plain
between
thirty
and
forty
miles
long
and
from
ten
to
twenty
broad
which
lies
below
the
city
exercise
a
witchery
which
the
scorching
heats
of
summer
must
utterly
destroy
footnotes
the
reader
will
recollect
that
the
erzerum
troubles
so
frequently
referred
to
consisted
of
riot
and
bloodshed
following
upon
a
search
for
arms
which
was
made
under
the
floors
of
the
armenian
cathedral
and
the
sanassarian
college
on
the
strength
it
is
said
of
an
anonymous
telegram
in
june
the
lucid
account
given
of
this
deplorable
affair
and
of
the
subsequent
inaction
of
the
local
government
by
her
britannic
majesty
for
kurdistan
in
the
white
book
to
which
allusion
has
been
made
should
be
studied
by
all
who
are
interested
in
the
armenian
question
in
a
despatch
in
the
white
book
no
clifford
lloyd
sums
up
the
condition
of
things
in
kurdistan
thus
in
a
country
such
as
this
is
lawlessness
is
to
be
expected
unfortunately
in
nearly
every
instance
armed
and
ungoverned
kurds
are
the
aggressors
and
unarmed
and
unprotected
armenian
christians
the
letter
xxxv
trebizond
the
journey
from
erzerum
to
trebizond
in
the
winter
season
occupies
from
ten
to
twelve
days
and
involves
a
transition
from
an
altitude
of
feet
to
the
and
from
treelessness
aridity
and
severities
of
cold
to
forests
and
moisture
a
temperate
climate
and
the
exquisite
greenness
of
the
slopes
which
descend
upon
the
black
sea
there
is
a
waggon
road
carefully
engineered
for
the
whole
distance
with
stone
bridges
in
excellent
repair
many
of
the
are
tolerable
supplies
can
be
procured
and
the
country
is
passably
safe
i
left
erzerum
on
the
of
december
escorted
by
my
kindly
hosts
as
far
as
elijeh
having
an
armenian
who
in
every
respect
gave
me
the
greatest
satisfaction
and
the
same
servants
as
before
the
mercury
fell
rapidly
the
following
night
was
below
zero
when
i
left
elijeh
for
ashkala
the
next
morning
and
never
rose
above
during
the
whole
day
the
road
follows
the
western
branch
of
the
euphrates
the
frat
a
reedy
and
winding
stream
the
horsemen
and
foot
passengers
were
mostly
muffled
up
in
heavy
cloaks
with
peaked
hoods
and
the
white
comforters
which
wrapped
up
their
faces
revealed
only
one
eye
peering
curiously
out
of
a
cavern
of
icicles
icicles
hung
from
the
noses
and
bodies
of
the
horses
it
was
not
possible
to
ride
more
than
half
an
hour
at
a
time
without
being
benumbed
and
the
snow
was
very
deep
for
walking
after
crossing
the
euphrates
twice
by
substantial
stone
bridges
i
halted
at
ashkala
a
village
of
at
a
clean
but
unfinished
on
the
bank
of
the
river
and
in
a
room
with
unglazed
windows
and
no
possibility
of
making
a
fire
experienced
a
temperature
of
below
zero
my
dinner
froze
before
i
could
finish
it
the
stock
of
potatoes
for
the
journey
though
wrapped
in
a
fur
cloak
inside
my
was
totally
spoilt
and
my
ink
froze
the
following
day
was
cloudy
and
inclined
to
snow
rather
than
frost
and
the
crossing
of
the
kop
dagh
was
managed
without
difficulty
in
five
hours
in
snow
three
feet
deep
there
is
a
refuge
near
the
summit
but
there
are
no
habitations
on
the
ascent
or
descent
it
is
a
most
dangerous
pass
owing
to
the
suddenness
and
fury
of
the
storms
and
only
last
winter
sixty
fine
camels
and
ten
drivers
perished
there
in
a
blizzard
my
was
left
behind
ill
at
the
refuge
and
i
made
the
remainder
of
the
journey
without
an
escort
the
kop
dagh
feet
in
altitude
forms
the
watershed
between
the
euphrates
valley
and
the
black
sea
and
on
such
an
afternoon
as
that
on
which
i
crossed
it
when
wild
storms
swept
over
successive
mountain
ranges
and
yet
wilder
gleams
lighted
up
the
sinuous
depression
which
marks
the
course
of
the
frat
the
view
from
its
lofty
summit
is
a
very
striking
one
it
was
dark
when
i
reached
the
very
miserable
hamlet
on
the
western
side
of
the
kop
and
as
earlier
caravans
had
taken
up
the
better
accommodation
i
had
to
content
myself
with
a
recess
opening
out
of
a
camel
stable
the
camels
sat
in
circles
of
ten
and
pleasant
family
parties
they
looked
gossiping
over
their
chopped
straw
which
with
a
ball
of
dough
in
the
morning
constitutes
their
slender
but
sufficient
diet
nothing
gives
a
grander
idea
of
the
magnitude
and
ramifications
of
commerce
than
the
traffic
on
the
road
from
erzerum
to
trebizond
during
eleven
days
there
has
scarcely
been
a
time
when
there
has
not
been
a
caravan
in
sight
and
indeed
they
succeed
each
other
in
a
nearly
endless
procession
the
majority
being
composed
of
stately
mountain
camels
gaily
caparisoned
carrying
large
musical
bells
their
of
crimson
leather
being
profusely
tasselled
and
elaborately
decorated
with
cowries
and
blue
beads
the
leader
of
each
caravan
wears
a
magnificent
covering
his
head
and
neck
on
which
embroidery
is
lavishly
used
in
combination
with
tinsel
and
coloured
glass
the
whole
being
surmounted
by
a
crown
with
a
plume
set
between
the
ears
there
is
one
driver
to
every
six
animals
and
these
men
fine
robust
sturdy
fellows
are
all
dressed
alike
in
strong
warm
clothing
the
chief
feature
of
which
is
a
great
brown
sheepskin
cap
of
mushroom
shape
which
projects
at
least
nine
inches
from
the
head
the
road
is
a
highway
for
british
goods
the
bales
and
packing
cases
are
almost
invariably
marked
with
british
names
and
trade
marks
the
exception
is
russian
kerosene
carried
by
asses
and
horses
of
which
an
enormous
quantity
was
on
the
road
i
was
glad
to
leave
kop
khané
at
daybreak
for
caravan
bells
jingled
chimed
tolled
and
pealed
all
night
and
my
neighbours
the
camels
were
under
weigh
at
the
road
descends
gently
down
the
wide
valley
of
the
tchoruk
the
ancient
acampsis
and
then
ascends
to
baiburt
a
town
with
a
population
of
about
souls
being
christians
it
is
very
picturesquely
situated
at
the
junction
of
two
or
three
valleys
the
houses
rise
irregularly
as
at
bitlis
tier
above
tier
and
the
resemblance
is
heightened
by
a
great
rock
which
rises
in
the
centre
the
long
and
varied
contour
of
which
is
followed
by
the
walls
of
a
fortress
imposing
even
in
its
ruins
round
and
square
towers
cresting
the
remarkable
eminence
a
handsome
military
college
on
a
height
wide
streets
lined
by
houses
with
projecting
upper
stories
and
and
busy
markets
in
which
an
enormous
quantity
of
mutton
is
exposed
for
sale
are
among
the
chief
features
of
this
very
striking
town
a
domiciliary
visit
from
a
courteous
chief
of
police
who
assured
me
that
an
escort
was
not
needed
and
my
passports
was
my
only
contact
with
turkish
officialism
between
erzerum
and
trebizond
after
leaving
baiburt
i
diverged
a
little
in
spite
of
very
deep
snow
to
visit
the
ruined
armenian
ecclesiastical
edifices
at
varzahan
a
village
from
which
a
mountain
road
to
trebizond
passing
near
the
greek
monastery
of
sumelas
branches
from
the
main
road
the
most
interesting
and
of
these
buildings
is
an
octagonal
chapel
of
a
very
elaborate
design
with
remains
of
a
circle
of
slender
shafts
a
very
fine
west
window
round
arches
and
some
curious
designs
in
fresco
in
another
a
pointed
arch
and
a
fragment
of
a
blind
arcade
with
niches
on
its
outer
face
remain
along
with
some
very
cable
and
twisted
moulding
it
was
truly
refreshing
to
come
upon
such
very
beautiful
relics
of
christian
art
in
so
wild
a
country
these
edifices
are
attributed
to
the
eleventh
or
twelfth
century
in
an
ancient
and
adjacent
cemetery
there
are
several
monumental
stone
rams
very
much
like
the
stone
lions
of
the
bakhtiari
country
i
quite
broke
down
on
that
march
and
was
obliged
to
bribe
the
turkish
occupants
of
a
most
miserable
hovel
to
vacate
it
for
me
and
on
the
following
day
was
only
able
to
ride
three
hours
to
getchid
the
sky
was
grim
and
threatening
and
the
snow
deep
and
when
after
a
long
ascent
we
descended
into
a
really
magnificent
defile
so
narrow
that
for
a
long
distance
the
whole
roadway
is
blasted
out
of
the
rock
a
violent
snowstorm
came
on
with
heavy
gusts
of
wind
there
were
high
mountains
with
a
few
trees
upon
them
dimly
seen
walling
in
the
wildest
and
most
rugged
part
of
the
defile
where
some
stables
offered
a
shelter
and
i
was
glad
to
be
allowed
to
occupy
the
wood
house
a
damp
excavation
in
the
mountain
side
no
words
can
convey
an
impression
of
the
roughness
of
asia
minor
travelling
in
winter
it
was
lonely
for
the
stable
where
the
servants
were
was
a
short
distance
off
and
the
came
several
times
to
adjure
me
to
keep
the
bolt
of
the
door
fastened
for
his
barley
was
in
my
keeping
and
there
was
a
gang
of
robbers
on
the
road
i
fell
asleep
however
but
was
awakened
at
midnight
by
yells
shouts
tramplings
and
a
most
violent
shaking
of
my
very
insecure
door
it
was
the
turkish
post
who
being
unable
to
get
into
the
stable
was
trying
to
bring
his
tired
horses
into
my
den
for
a
little
rest
fine
fellows
these
turkish
mail
riders
are
who
carry
the
weekly
mail
from
trebizond
into
the
interior
the
post
drives
two
horses
loaded
with
the
mail
bags
in
front
of
him
at
a
gallop
urging
them
with
yells
and
his
heavy
whip
the
escort
galloping
behind
and
at
this
pace
they
dash
up
and
down
mountains
and
over
plains
by
day
and
night
changing
at
short
intervals
and
are
only
behind
time
in
the
very
worst
of
weather
snow
fell
heavily
all
night
and
until
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
but
we
started
soon
after
seven
and
plodded
steadily
along
in
an
atmosphere
of
mystery
through
intricate
defiles
among
lofty
mountains
strange
sounds
vanishing
ravines
and
momentary
glimpses
of
villages
on
heights
precipices
suggestive
of
the
days
of
genoese
supremacy
as
in
the
magnificent
gorge
of
kala
and
long
strings
of
camels
magnified
in
the
to
the
kala
village
with
its
dashing
torrent
its
fine
walnut
trees
and
its
immense
camel
stables
in
and
outside
of
which
camels
were
taking
shelter
from
the
storm
we
pushed
on
however
during
that
day
and
the
next
through
the
beautiful
and
populous
gumushkhané
valley
to
kupru
bridge
having
descended
almost
steadily
for
five
days
the
narrow
valley
of
the
kharshut
is
magnificent
and
on
the
second
day
the
snow
was
only
lying
on
the
heights
the
traveller
is
seldom
out
of
sight
of
houses
which
are
built
on
every
possible
projection
above
the
river
and
on
narrow
spurs
in
wild
lateral
ravines
and
wherever
there
are
houses
there
are
walnut
pear
apple
and
apricot
trees
with
smooth
green
sward
below
and
the
walnut
branches
often
meet
over
the
road
the
houses
are
mostly
large
often
whitewashed
always
and
much
like
swiss
but
without
the
long
slopes
of
verdure
which
make
switzerland
so
fair
instead
of
verdure
there
is
the
wildest
rock
and
mountain
scenery
a
congeries
of
precipices
and
pinnacles
and
the
semblance
of
minarets
and
fortresses
flaming
red
or
burnt
sienna
or
yellow
ochre
intermingled
with
bold
fronts
of
crimson
and
pale
blue
rock
the
crimson
cliffs
looking
in
the
rain
as
if
torrents
of
blood
were
pouring
over
them
the
roadway
has
been
both
blasted
out
of
the
rock
and
built
up
from
the
river
far
up
picturesque
ravines
oxen
were
ploughing
the
red
friable
soil
on
heights
which
looked
inaccessible
there
was
the
velvety
greenness
of
winter
wheat
scrub
oak
and
barberry
find
in
rocky
rifts
and
among
crags
high
up
among
the
glittering
snows
contorted
junipers
struggle
for
a
precarious
existence
the
road
was
enlivened
by
local
as
well
as
through
traffic
and
brightened
by
the
varied
costumes
of
turks
greeks
armenians
and
lazes
the
latter
do
not
resemble
the
turks
in
physiognomy
or
costume
all
of
them
carry
rifles
and
sabres
and
two
daggers
in
their
girdles
one
of
which
always
has
a
cloven
hilt
they
are
on
their
way
to
their
native
province
of
lazistan
with
droves
of
horses
and
are
much
dreaded
by
both
the
and
on
the
road
for
their
marauding
habits
the
turkish
government
has
a
very
difficult
task
in
ruling
and
pacifying
the
number
of
races
which
it
has
subjugated
even
in
asiatic
turkey
between
the
arabs
of
the
chaldæan
plains
and
the
lazes
of
the
shores
of
the
black
sea
i
have
met
even
in
my
limited
travels
with
sabeans
jews
armenians
syrians
yezidis
kurds
osmanlis
circassians
and
greeks
alien
and
antagonistic
in
creed
and
race
but
somehow
held
together
and
to
some
extent
governed
by
a
power
which
is
i
think
by
no
means
so
feeble
as
she
is
sometimes
supposed
to
be
the
kharshut
is
crossed
at
kupru
bridge
by
a
very
fine
stone
arch
this
village
at
the
foot
of
the
zigana
mountain
is
entirely
composed
of
inferior
food
shops
and
smiths
shops
the
clang
of
hammers
lasted
late
into
the
night
for
the
road
was
reported
as
icy
and
more
than
horses
and
mules
were
having
their
shoes
roughed
for
the
passage
of
the
zigana
mountain
i
arrived
late
in
the
evening
when
all
the
were
full
and
had
to
put
up
in
a
hovel
the
door
of
which
was
twice
attempted
during
the
night
by
a
band
of
lazes
about
whose
proceedings
stephan
my
had
been
very
suspicious
after
the
servants
and
roused
by
my
whistle
had
rushed
out
of
an
opposite
stable
upon
the
marauders
i
lay
awake
for
some
time
trying
to
realise
that
my
ride
of
miles
was
nearly
at
an
end
and
that
european
civilisation
was
only
five
days
off
but
it
was
in
vain
i
felt
as
if
i
should
be
sleeping
in
stables
or
dark
dens
uttering
the
call
to
boot
and
saddle
two
hours
before
daylight
crawling
along
mountain
roads
on
a
woolly
horse
planning
marches
studying
asiatic
character
and
sinking
deeper
into
barbarism
from
the
summit
of
the
zigana
mountain
to
trebizond
is
a
steady
descent
of
twelve
hours
the
ascent
from
kupru
bridge
occupied
five
hours
and
a
half
it
was
a
much
more
serious
affair
than
crossing
the
kop
dagh
for
the
snowstorm
had
lasted
for
three
days
the
snow
was
from
four
to
nine
feet
deep
on
the
summit
and
the
thawing
of
its
surface
at
the
lower
altitudes
succeeded
by
keen
frost
had
resulted
in
the
production
of
slopes
of
ice
over
which
i
had
to
walk
for
two
hours
as
could
scarcely
keep
on
his
feet
the
early
snow
has
a
witchery
of
its
own
and
it
may
be
that
the
zigana
mountain
and
the
views
from
it
are
not
so
beautiful
as
i
think
them
but
under
the
circumstances
in
which
i
saw
them
i
was
astonished
with
the
magnificence
of
the
scenery
and
with
the
vast
pine
forests
which
clothe
the
mountain
sides
villages
of
with
irregular
balconies
and
steep
roofs
projecting
from
two
to
six
feet
are
perched
on
rocky
heights
or
nestle
among
walnuts
with
a
blue
background
of
pines
above
which
tower
spires
and
peaks
of
unsullied
snow
ridges
rise
into
fantastic
forms
and
mimicries
of
minarets
and
castles
pines
filling
gigantic
ravines
with
their
blue
gloom
stand
sentinels
over
torrents
silenced
for
the
winter
and
colossal
heights
and
colossal
depths
an
uplifted
snow
world
of
ceaseless
surprises
under
a
blue
sky
full
of
light
make
one
fancy
oneself
in
switzerland
till
a
long
train
of
decorated
camels
or
a
turbaned
party
of
armed
travellers
dissipates
the
dream
the
last
hour
of
the
ascent
was
very
severe
the
wind
was
strong
and
keen
and
the
drifting
snow
buffeted
us
unmercifully
the
mercury
fell
to
below
zero
and
the
cold
was
intense
murphy
complained
of
trembles
in
his
knees
and
severe
pain
in
his
legs
and
when
we
reached
the
summit
was
really
ill
the
drift
was
not
only
blinding
and
stinging
but
suffocating
i
was
quite
breathless
and
felt
a
chill
round
my
heart
i
could
not
even
see
neck
and
he
cowered
from
the
blast
but
just
as
all
things
were
obliterated
i
found
myself
being
helped
to
dismount
in
the
shelter
of
a
camel
stable
full
of
lazes
but
was
so
benumbed
that
i
could
not
stand
some
had
the
humanity
to
offer
me
the
shelter
of
a
hovel
nearly
buried
in
the
snow
and
made
a
fire
and
some
coffee
and
i
waited
there
till
the
wind
moderated
it
came
in
such
fierce
gusts
as
actually
to
blow
two
of
the
baggage
horses
over
on
their
sides
murphy
was
really
ill
of
fever
for
two
days
from
the
cold
and
exposure
the
altitude
of
the
pass
is
about
feet
the
first
part
of
the
descent
was
made
on
foot
for
the
snow
had
drifted
on
the
road
to
a
height
of
fully
twenty
feet
leaving
only
a
path
of
shelving
ice
on
the
brink
of
a
precipitous
slope
earlier
in
the
day
twenty
laden
camels
had
gone
over
and
were
heaped
in
the
ravine
below
not
all
dead
the
road
dips
with
some
suddenness
into
a
deep
glen
dark
with
pine
and
beech
forests
large
rhododendrons
and
the
forming
a
dense
undergrowth
long
gray
lichen
hung
from
the
branches
christmas
roses
and
premature
primroses
bloomed
in
sheltered
places
the
familiar
polypody
and
the
adiantum
filled
every
crevice
soft
green
moss
draped
the
rocks
there
was
a
delicious
smell
of
damp
autumn
leaves
and
when
we
reached
the
greek
village
of
hamzikeuy
clouds
were
rolling
heavily
up
the
valley
from
the
not
far
distant
ocean
the
two
days
which
followed
were
easy
and
pleasant
through
a
prosperous
and
peopled
valley
brightened
by
the
rushing
waters
of
the
surmel
the
ancient
pyxites
orchards
and
tillage
beautify
the
lower
slopes
of
the
mountains
the
road
is
excellent
the
homesteads
are
in
good
repair
the
people
are
bright
and
and
greek
villages
with
prominent
churches
on
elevated
spurs
add
an
element
of
christian
civilisation
to
the
landscape
the
exceeding
beauty
of
natural
forests
of
soft
green
sward
starred
with
the
blossoms
of
the
greater
hellebore
of
abounding
ferns
and
trailers
of
the
earth
bringing
forth
grass
the
herb
yielding
seed
and
the
tree
yielding
fruit
after
his
kind
of
prosperous
villages
with
cheerful
houses
and
roofs
can
only
be
fully
appreciated
by
the
traveller
who
has
toiled
over
the
burning
wastes
of
persia
with
their
mud
villages
and
mud
ruins
and
across
the
bleak
mountains
and
monotonous
plateaux
of
the
armenian
highlands
with
their
dwellings
and
their
population
for
ever
ravaged
by
the
kurd
tilled
with
a
pencil
carefully
weeded
and
abundantly
manured
the
country
looks
like
a
garden
the
industrious
greek
population
thrives
under
the
rule
of
the
osmanlis
travellers
on
foot
and
on
horseback
abound
and
and
succeed
each
other
rapidly
when
the
long
descent
alongside
of
the
surmel
was
accomplished
the
scenery
gradually
became
tamer
and
the
look
of
civilisation
more
emphasised
the
grass
was
if
possible
greener
the
blossoming
hellebore
more
abundant
detached
balconied
houses
with
their
barns
and
outhouses
evidenced
the
security
of
the
country
the
fig
began
to
find
a
place
in
the
orchards
the
funereal
cypress
appeared
in
its
fitting
position
among
graves
and
there
was
a
briny
odour
in
the
air
but
unfortunately
for
the
traveller
the
admirable
engineering
of
the
modern
waggon
road
deprives
him
of
that
magnificent
view
of
the
ocean
from
a
height
which
has
wrung
from
many
a
wanderer
since
the
days
of
the
ten
thousand
the
joyful
exclamation
thalatta
the
valley
opened
there
was
a
low
grassy
hill
beyond
it
broad
yellow
sands
on
which
the
stormy
euxine
thundered
in
long
creamy
surges
and
creeping
up
the
sides
of
a
wooded
headland
among
luxuriant
vegetation
the
houses
of
the
eastern
suburb
of
trebizond
the
ancient
trapezus
it
was
the
journey
end
yet
such
is
the
magic
charm
of
asia
that
i
would
willingly
have
turned
back
at
that
moment
to
the
snowy
plateaux
of
armenia
and
the
savage
mountains
