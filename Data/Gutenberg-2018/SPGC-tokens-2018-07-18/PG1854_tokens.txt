catherine
de
medici
by
honore
de
balzac
translated
by
katherine
prescott
wormeley
dedication
to
monsieur
le
marquis
de
pastoret
member
of
the
academie
des
when
we
think
of
the
enormous
number
of
volumes
that
have
been
published
on
the
question
as
to
where
hannibal
crossed
the
alps
without
our
being
able
to
decide
whether
it
was
according
to
whittaker
and
rivaz
by
lyon
geneva
the
great
and
the
valley
of
aosta
or
according
to
letronne
follard
and
fortia
d
urbano
by
the
isere
grenoble
monte
genevra
fenestrella
and
the
susa
passage
or
according
to
larauza
by
the
mont
cenis
and
the
susa
or
according
to
strabo
polybius
and
lucanus
by
the
rhone
vienne
yenne
and
the
dent
du
chat
or
according
to
some
intelligent
minds
by
genoa
la
bochetta
and
la
scrivia
an
opinion
which
i
share
and
which
napoleon
adopted
not
to
speak
of
the
verjuice
with
which
the
alpine
rocks
have
been
bespattered
by
other
learned
men
is
it
surprising
monsieur
le
marquis
to
see
modern
history
so
bemuddled
that
many
important
points
are
still
obscure
and
the
most
odious
calumnies
still
rest
on
names
that
ought
to
be
respected
and
let
me
remark
in
passing
that
hannibal
s
crossing
has
been
made
almost
problematical
by
these
very
elucidations
for
instance
pere
menestrier
thinks
that
the
scoras
mentioned
by
polybius
is
the
saona
letronne
larauza
and
schweighauser
think
it
is
the
isere
cochard
a
learned
lyonnais
calls
it
the
drome
and
for
all
who
have
eyes
to
see
there
are
between
scoras
and
scrivia
great
geographical
and
linguistical
resemblances
to
say
nothing
of
the
probability
amounting
almost
to
certainty
that
the
carthaginian
fleet
was
moored
in
the
gulf
of
spezzia
or
the
roadstead
of
genoa
i
could
understand
these
patient
researches
if
there
were
any
doubt
as
to
the
battle
of
canna
but
inasmuch
as
the
results
of
that
great
battle
are
known
why
blacken
paper
with
all
these
suppositions
which
are
as
it
were
the
arabesques
of
hypothesis
while
the
history
most
important
to
the
present
day
that
of
the
reformation
is
full
of
such
obscurities
that
we
are
ignorant
of
the
real
name
of
the
man
who
navigated
a
vessel
by
steam
to
barcelona
at
the
period
when
luther
and
calvin
were
inaugurating
the
insurrection
of
thought
you
and
i
hold
i
think
the
same
opinion
after
having
made
each
in
his
own
way
close
researches
as
to
the
grand
and
splendid
figure
of
catherine
de
medici
consequently
i
have
thought
that
my
historical
studies
upon
that
queen
might
properly
be
dedicated
to
an
author
who
has
written
so
much
on
the
history
of
the
reformation
while
at
the
same
time
i
offer
to
the
character
and
fidelity
of
a
monarchical
writer
a
public
homage
which
may
perhaps
be
valuable
on
account
of
its
rarity
the
name
of
the
man
who
tried
this
experiment
at
barcelona
should
be
given
as
salomon
de
caux
not
caus
that
great
man
has
always
been
unfortunate
even
after
his
death
his
name
is
mangled
salomon
whose
portrait
taken
at
the
age
of
was
discovered
by
the
author
of
the
comedy
of
human
life
at
heidelberg
was
born
at
caux
in
normandy
he
was
the
author
of
a
book
entitled
the
causes
of
moving
forces
in
which
he
gave
the
theory
of
the
expansion
and
condensation
of
steam
he
died
in
catherine
de
medici
introduction
there
is
a
general
cry
of
paradox
when
scholars
struck
by
some
historical
error
attempt
to
correct
it
but
for
whoever
studies
modern
history
to
its
depths
it
is
plain
that
historians
are
privileged
liars
who
lend
their
pen
to
popular
beliefs
precisely
as
the
newspapers
of
the
day
or
most
of
them
express
the
opinions
of
their
readers
historical
independence
has
shown
itself
much
less
among
lay
writers
than
among
those
of
the
church
it
is
from
the
benedictines
one
of
the
glories
of
france
that
the
purest
light
has
come
to
us
in
the
matter
of
history
so
long
of
course
as
the
interests
of
the
order
were
not
involved
about
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
great
and
learned
controversialists
struck
by
the
necessity
of
correcting
popular
errors
endorsed
by
historians
made
and
published
to
the
world
very
remarkable
works
thus
monsieur
de
launoy
nicknamed
the
expeller
of
saints
made
cruel
war
upon
the
saints
surreptitiously
smuggled
into
the
church
thus
the
emulators
of
the
benedictines
the
members
too
little
recognized
of
the
academie
des
inscriptions
et
began
on
many
obscure
historical
points
a
series
of
monographs
which
are
admirable
for
patience
erudition
and
logical
consistency
thus
voltaire
for
a
mistaken
purpose
and
with
passion
frequently
cast
the
light
of
his
mind
on
historical
prejudices
diderot
undertook
in
this
direction
a
book
much
too
long
on
the
era
of
imperial
rome
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
french
revolution
applied
to
history
might
then
have
prepared
the
elements
of
a
good
and
true
history
of
france
the
proofs
for
which
had
long
been
gathered
by
the
benedictines
louis
a
just
mind
himself
translated
the
english
work
in
which
walpole
endeavored
to
explain
richard
a
work
much
talked
of
in
the
last
century
why
do
personages
so
celebrated
as
kings
and
queens
so
important
as
the
generals
of
armies
become
objects
of
horror
or
derision
half
the
world
hesitates
between
the
famous
song
on
marlborough
and
the
history
of
england
and
it
also
hesitates
between
history
and
popular
tradition
as
to
charles
ix
at
all
epochs
when
great
struggles
take
place
between
the
masses
and
authority
the
populace
creates
for
itself
an
personage
if
it
is
allowable
to
coin
a
word
to
convey
a
just
idea
thus
to
take
an
example
in
our
own
time
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
memorial
of
saint
helena
and
the
controversies
between
the
royalists
and
the
bonapartists
there
was
every
probability
that
the
character
of
napoleon
would
have
been
misunderstood
a
few
more
abbe
de
pradits
a
few
more
newspaper
articles
and
from
being
an
emperor
napoleon
would
have
turned
into
an
ogre
how
does
error
propagate
itself
the
mystery
is
accomplished
under
our
very
eyes
without
our
perceiving
it
no
one
suspects
how
much
solidity
the
art
of
printing
has
given
both
to
the
envy
which
pursues
greatness
and
to
the
popular
ridicule
which
fastens
a
contrary
sense
on
a
grand
historical
act
thus
the
name
of
the
prince
de
polignac
is
given
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
france
to
all
bad
horses
that
require
whipping
and
who
knows
how
that
will
affect
the
opinion
of
the
future
as
to
the
d
of
the
prince
de
polignac
himself
in
consequence
of
a
whim
of
shakespeare
or
perhaps
it
may
have
been
a
revenge
like
that
of
beaumarchais
on
bergasse
bergearss
falstaff
is
in
england
a
type
of
the
ridiculous
his
very
name
provokes
laughter
he
is
the
king
of
clowns
now
instead
of
being
enormously
absurdly
amorous
vain
drunken
old
and
corrupted
falstaff
was
one
of
the
most
distinguished
men
of
his
time
a
knight
of
the
garter
holding
a
high
command
in
the
army
at
the
accession
of
henry
sir
john
falstaff
was
only
years
old
this
general
who
distinguished
himself
at
the
battle
of
agincourt
and
there
took
prisoner
the
duc
d
alencon
captured
in
the
town
of
montereau
which
was
vigorously
defended
moreover
under
henry
vi
he
defeated
ten
thousand
french
troops
with
fifteen
hundred
weary
and
famished
men
so
much
for
war
now
let
us
pass
to
literature
and
see
our
own
rabelais
a
sober
man
who
drank
nothing
but
water
but
is
held
to
be
nevertheless
an
extravagant
lover
of
good
cheer
and
a
resolute
drinker
a
thousand
ridiculous
stories
are
told
about
the
author
of
one
of
the
finest
books
in
french
literature
aretino
the
friend
of
titian
and
the
voltaire
of
his
century
has
in
our
day
a
reputation
the
exact
opposite
of
his
works
and
of
his
character
a
reputation
which
he
owes
to
a
grossness
of
wit
in
keeping
with
the
writings
of
his
age
when
broad
farce
was
held
in
honor
and
queens
and
cardinals
wrote
tales
which
would
be
called
in
these
days
licentious
one
might
go
on
multiplying
such
instances
indefinitely
in
france
and
that
too
during
the
most
serious
epoch
of
modern
history
no
woman
unless
it
be
brunehaut
or
fredegonde
has
suffered
from
popular
error
so
much
as
catherine
de
medici
whereas
marie
de
medici
all
of
whose
actions
were
prejudicial
to
france
has
escaped
the
shame
which
ought
to
cover
her
name
marie
de
medici
wasted
the
wealth
amassed
by
henri
iv
she
never
purged
herself
of
the
charge
of
having
known
of
the
king
s
assassination
her
was
d
epernon
who
did
not
ward
off
ravaillac
s
blow
and
who
was
proved
to
have
known
the
murderer
personally
for
a
long
time
marie
s
conduct
was
such
that
she
forced
her
son
to
banish
her
from
france
where
she
was
encouraging
her
other
son
gaston
to
rebel
and
the
victory
richelieu
at
last
won
over
her
on
the
day
of
the
dupes
was
due
solely
to
the
discovery
the
cardinal
made
and
imparted
to
louis
of
secret
documents
relating
to
the
death
of
henri
iv
catherine
de
medici
on
the
contrary
saved
the
crown
of
france
she
maintained
the
royal
authority
in
the
midst
of
circumstances
under
which
more
than
one
great
prince
would
have
succumbed
having
to
make
head
against
factions
and
ambitions
like
those
of
the
guises
and
the
house
of
bourbon
against
men
such
as
the
two
cardinals
of
lorraine
the
two
balafres
and
the
two
condes
against
the
queen
jeanne
d
albret
henri
the
connetable
de
montmorency
calvin
the
three
colignys
theodore
de
beze
she
needed
to
possess
and
to
display
the
rare
qualities
and
precious
gifts
of
a
statesman
under
the
mocking
fire
of
the
calvinist
press
those
facts
are
incontestable
therefore
to
whosoever
burrows
into
the
history
of
the
sixteenth
century
in
france
the
figure
of
catherine
de
medici
will
seem
like
that
of
a
great
king
when
calumny
is
once
dissipated
by
facts
recovered
with
difficulty
from
among
the
contradictions
of
pamphlets
and
false
anecdotes
all
explains
itself
to
the
fame
of
this
extraordinary
woman
who
had
none
of
the
weaknesses
of
her
sex
who
lived
chaste
amid
the
license
of
the
most
dissolute
court
in
europe
and
who
in
spite
of
her
lack
of
money
erected
noble
public
buildings
as
if
to
repair
the
loss
caused
by
the
iconoclasms
of
the
calvinists
who
did
as
much
harm
to
art
as
to
the
body
politic
hemmed
in
between
the
guises
who
claimed
to
be
the
heirs
of
charlemagne
and
the
factious
younger
branch
who
sought
to
screen
the
treachery
of
the
connetable
de
bourbon
behind
the
throne
catherine
forced
to
combat
heresy
which
was
seeking
to
annihilate
the
monarchy
without
friends
aware
of
treachery
among
the
leaders
of
the
catholic
party
foreseeing
a
republic
in
the
calvinist
party
catherine
employed
the
most
dangerous
but
the
surest
weapon
of
public
policy
craft
she
resolved
to
trick
and
so
defeat
successively
the
guises
who
were
seeking
the
ruin
of
the
house
of
valois
the
bourbons
who
sought
the
crown
and
the
reformers
the
radicals
of
those
days
who
dreamed
of
an
impossible
republic
like
those
of
our
time
who
have
however
nothing
to
reform
consequently
so
long
as
she
lived
the
valois
kept
the
throne
of
france
the
great
historian
of
that
time
de
thou
knew
well
the
value
of
this
woman
when
on
hearing
of
her
death
he
exclaimed
it
is
not
a
woman
it
is
monarchy
itself
that
has
died
catherine
had
in
the
highest
degree
the
sense
of
royalty
and
she
defended
it
with
admirable
courage
and
persistency
the
reproaches
which
calvinist
writers
have
cast
upon
her
are
to
her
glory
she
incurred
them
by
reason
only
of
her
triumphs
could
she
placed
as
she
was
triumph
otherwise
than
by
craft
the
whole
question
lies
there
as
for
violence
that
means
is
one
of
the
most
disputed
questions
of
public
policy
in
our
time
it
has
been
answered
on
the
place
louis
where
they
have
now
set
up
an
egyptian
stone
as
if
to
obliterate
regicide
and
offer
a
symbol
of
the
system
of
materialistic
policy
which
governs
us
it
was
answered
at
the
carmes
and
at
the
abbaye
answered
on
the
steps
of
answered
once
more
by
the
people
against
the
king
before
the
louvre
in
as
it
has
since
been
answered
by
lafayette
s
best
of
all
possible
republics
against
the
republican
insurrection
at
and
the
rue
transnonnain
all
power
legitimate
or
illegitimate
must
defend
itself
when
attacked
but
the
strange
thing
is
that
where
the
people
are
held
heroic
in
their
victory
over
the
nobility
power
is
called
murderous
in
its
duel
with
the
people
if
it
succumbs
after
its
appeal
to
force
power
is
then
called
imbecile
the
present
government
is
attempting
to
save
itself
by
two
laws
from
the
same
evil
charles
tried
to
escape
by
two
ordinances
is
it
not
a
bitter
derision
is
craft
permissible
in
the
hands
of
power
against
craft
may
it
kill
those
who
seek
to
kill
it
the
massacres
of
the
revolution
have
replied
to
the
massacres
of
the
people
become
king
have
done
against
the
king
and
the
nobility
what
the
king
and
the
nobility
did
against
the
insurgents
of
the
sixteenth
century
therefore
the
popular
historians
who
know
very
well
that
in
a
like
case
the
people
will
do
the
same
thing
over
again
have
no
excuse
for
blaming
catherine
de
medici
and
charles
ix
all
power
said
casimir
perier
on
learning
what
power
ought
to
be
is
a
permanent
we
admire
the
maxims
put
forth
by
daring
writers
why
then
this
disapproval
which
in
france
attaches
to
all
social
truths
when
boldly
proclaimed
this
question
will
explain
in
itself
alone
historical
errors
apply
the
answer
to
the
destructive
doctrines
which
flatter
popular
passions
and
to
the
conservative
doctrines
which
repress
the
mad
efforts
of
the
people
and
you
will
find
the
reason
of
the
unpopularity
and
also
the
popularity
of
certain
personages
laubardemont
and
laffemas
were
like
some
men
of
devoted
to
the
defence
of
power
in
which
they
believed
soldiers
or
judges
they
all
obeyed
royalty
in
these
days
d
orthez
would
be
dismissed
for
having
misunderstood
the
orders
of
the
ministry
but
charles
left
him
governor
of
a
province
the
power
of
the
many
is
accountable
to
no
one
the
power
of
one
is
compelled
to
render
account
to
its
subjects
to
the
great
as
well
as
to
the
small
catherine
like
philip
the
second
and
the
duke
of
alba
like
the
guises
and
cardinal
granvelle
saw
plainly
the
future
that
the
reformation
was
bringing
upon
europe
she
and
they
saw
monarchies
religion
authority
shaken
catherine
wrote
from
the
cabinet
of
the
kings
of
france
a
sentence
of
death
to
that
spirit
of
inquiry
which
then
began
to
threaten
modern
society
a
sentence
which
louis
xiv
ended
by
executing
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
was
an
unfortunate
measure
only
so
far
as
it
caused
the
irritation
of
all
europe
against
louis
xiv
at
another
period
england
holland
and
the
holy
roman
empire
would
not
have
welcomed
banished
frenchmen
and
encouraged
revolt
in
france
why
refuse
in
these
days
to
the
majestic
adversary
of
the
most
barren
of
heresies
the
grandeur
she
derived
from
the
struggle
itself
calvinists
have
written
much
against
the
craftiness
of
charles
ix
but
travel
through
france
see
the
ruins
of
noble
churches
estimate
the
fearful
wounds
given
by
the
religionists
to
the
social
body
learn
what
vengeance
they
inflicted
and
you
will
ask
yourself
as
you
deplore
the
evils
of
individualism
the
disease
of
our
present
france
the
germ
of
which
was
in
the
questions
of
liberty
of
conscience
then
agitated
you
will
ask
yourself
i
say
on
which
side
were
the
executioners
there
are
unfortunately
as
catherine
herself
says
in
the
third
division
of
this
study
of
her
career
in
all
ages
hypocritical
writers
always
ready
to
weep
over
the
fate
of
two
hundred
scoundrels
killed
caesar
who
tried
to
move
the
senate
to
pity
the
attempt
of
catiline
might
perhaps
have
got
the
better
of
cicero
could
he
have
had
an
opposition
and
its
newspapers
at
his
command
another
consideration
explains
the
historical
and
popular
disfavor
in
which
catherine
is
held
the
opposition
in
france
has
always
been
protestant
because
it
has
had
no
policy
but
that
of
it
inherits
the
theories
of
lutherans
calvinists
and
protestants
on
the
terrible
words
liberty
tolerance
progress
and
two
centuries
have
been
employed
by
the
opponents
of
power
in
establishing
the
doubtful
doctrine
of
the
liberty
of
will
two
other
centuries
were
employed
in
developing
the
first
corollary
of
liberty
of
will
namely
liberty
of
conscience
our
century
is
endeavoring
to
establish
the
second
namely
political
liberty
placed
between
the
ground
already
lost
and
the
ground
still
to
be
defended
catherine
and
the
church
proclaimed
the
salutary
principle
of
modern
societies
fides
unus
using
their
power
of
life
and
death
upon
the
innovators
though
catherine
was
vanquished
succeeding
centuries
have
proved
her
justification
the
product
of
liberty
of
will
religious
liberty
and
political
liberty
not
observe
this
to
be
confounded
with
civil
liberty
is
the
france
of
what
is
the
france
of
a
country
occupied
exclusively
with
material
interests
without
patriotism
without
conscience
where
power
has
no
vigor
where
election
the
fruit
of
liberty
of
will
and
political
liberty
lifts
to
the
surface
none
but
commonplace
men
where
brute
force
has
now
become
a
necessity
against
popular
violence
where
discussion
spreading
into
everything
stifles
the
action
of
legislative
bodies
where
money
rules
all
questions
where
individualism
the
dreadful
product
of
the
division
of
property
will
suppress
the
family
and
devour
all
even
the
nation
which
egoism
will
some
day
deliver
over
to
invasion
men
will
say
why
not
the
czar
just
as
they
said
why
not
the
duc
d
orleans
we
don
t
cling
to
many
things
even
now
but
fifty
years
hence
we
shall
cling
to
nothing
thus
according
to
catherine
de
medici
and
according
to
all
those
who
believe
in
a
society
in
the
subject
can
not
have
liberty
of
will
ought
not
to
the
dogma
of
liberty
of
conscience
or
demand
political
liberty
but
as
no
society
can
exist
without
guarantees
granted
to
the
subject
against
the
sovereign
there
results
for
the
subject
subject
to
restriction
liberty
no
liberties
yes
precise
and
liberties
that
is
in
harmony
with
the
nature
of
things
it
is
assuredly
beyond
the
reach
of
human
power
to
prevent
the
liberty
of
thought
and
no
sovereign
can
interfere
with
money
the
great
statesmen
who
were
vanquished
in
the
long
struggle
it
lasted
five
centuries
recognized
the
right
of
subjects
to
great
liberties
but
they
did
not
admit
their
right
to
publish
thoughts
nor
did
they
admit
the
indefinite
liberty
of
the
subject
to
them
the
words
subject
and
liberty
were
terms
that
contradicted
each
other
just
as
the
theory
of
citizens
being
all
equal
constitutes
an
absurdity
which
nature
contradicts
at
every
moment
to
recognize
the
necessity
of
a
religion
the
necessity
of
authority
and
then
to
leave
to
subjects
the
right
to
deny
religion
attack
its
worship
oppose
the
exercise
of
power
by
public
expression
communicable
and
communicated
by
thought
was
an
impossibility
which
the
catholics
of
the
sixteenth
century
would
not
hear
of
alas
the
victory
of
calvinism
will
cost
france
more
in
the
future
than
it
has
yet
cost
her
for
religious
sects
and
humanitarian
politics
are
the
tail
of
calvinism
and
judging
by
the
mistakes
of
the
present
power
its
contempt
for
intellect
its
love
for
material
interests
in
which
it
seeks
the
basis
of
its
support
though
material
interests
are
the
most
treacherous
of
all
supports
we
may
predict
that
unless
some
providence
intervenes
the
genius
of
destruction
will
again
carry
the
day
over
the
genius
of
preservation
the
assailants
who
have
nothing
to
lose
and
all
to
gain
understand
each
other
thoroughly
whereas
their
rich
adversaries
will
not
make
any
sacrifice
either
of
money
or
to
draw
to
themselves
supporters
the
art
of
printing
came
to
the
aid
of
the
opposition
begun
by
the
vaudois
and
the
albigenses
as
soon
as
human
thought
instead
of
condensing
itself
as
it
was
formerly
forced
to
do
to
remain
in
communicable
form
took
on
a
multitude
of
garments
and
became
as
it
were
the
people
itself
instead
of
remaining
a
sort
of
axiomatic
divinity
there
were
two
multitudes
to
combat
the
multitude
of
ideas
and
the
multitude
of
men
the
royal
power
succumbed
in
that
warfare
and
we
are
now
assisting
in
france
at
its
last
combination
with
elements
which
render
its
existence
difficult
not
to
say
impossible
power
is
action
and
the
elective
principle
is
discussion
there
is
no
policy
no
statesmanship
possible
where
discussion
is
permanent
therefore
we
ought
to
recognize
the
grandeur
of
the
woman
who
had
the
eyes
to
see
this
future
and
fought
it
bravely
that
the
house
of
bourbon
was
able
to
succeed
to
the
house
of
valois
that
it
found
a
crown
preserved
to
it
was
due
solely
to
catherine
de
medici
suppose
the
second
balafre
had
lived
no
matter
how
strong
the
bearnais
was
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
could
have
seized
the
crown
seeing
how
dearly
the
duc
de
mayenne
and
the
remains
of
the
guise
party
sold
it
to
him
the
means
employed
by
catherine
who
certainly
had
to
reproach
herself
with
the
deaths
of
francois
ii
and
charles
whose
lives
might
have
been
saved
in
time
were
never
it
is
observable
made
the
subject
of
accusations
by
either
the
calvinists
or
modern
historians
though
there
was
no
poisoning
as
some
grave
writers
have
said
there
was
other
conduct
almost
as
criminal
there
is
no
doubt
she
hindered
pare
from
saving
one
and
allowed
the
other
to
accomplish
his
own
doom
by
moral
assassination
but
the
sudden
death
of
francois
and
that
of
charles
were
no
injury
to
the
calvinists
and
therefore
the
causes
of
these
two
events
remained
in
their
secret
sphere
and
were
never
suspected
either
by
the
writers
of
the
people
of
that
day
they
were
not
divined
except
by
de
thou
l
hopital
and
minds
of
that
calibre
or
by
the
leaders
of
the
two
parties
who
were
coveting
or
defending
the
throne
and
believed
such
means
necessary
to
their
end
popular
songs
attacked
strangely
enough
catherine
s
morals
every
one
knows
the
anecdote
of
the
soldier
who
was
roasting
a
goose
in
the
courtyard
of
the
chateau
de
tours
during
the
conference
between
catherine
and
henri
singing
as
he
did
so
a
song
in
which
the
queen
was
grossly
insulted
henri
iv
drew
his
sword
to
go
out
and
kill
the
man
but
catherine
stopped
him
and
contented
herself
with
calling
from
the
window
to
her
insulter
eh
but
it
was
catherine
who
gave
you
the
though
the
executions
at
amboise
were
attributed
to
catherine
and
though
the
calvinists
made
her
responsible
for
all
the
inevitable
evils
of
that
struggle
it
was
with
her
as
it
was
later
with
robespierre
who
is
still
waiting
to
be
justly
judged
catherine
was
moreover
rightly
punished
for
her
preference
for
the
duc
d
anjou
to
whose
interests
the
two
elder
brothers
were
sacrificed
henri
like
all
spoilt
children
ended
in
becoming
absolutely
indifferent
to
his
mother
and
he
plunged
voluntarily
into
the
life
of
debauchery
which
made
of
him
what
his
mother
had
made
of
charles
a
husband
without
sons
a
king
without
heirs
unhappily
the
duc
d
alencon
catherine
s
last
male
child
had
already
died
a
natural
death
the
last
words
of
the
great
queen
were
like
a
summing
up
of
her
lifelong
policy
which
was
moreover
so
plain
in
its
that
all
cabinets
are
seen
under
similar
circumstances
to
put
it
in
practice
enough
cut
off
my
son
she
said
when
henri
iii
came
to
her
to
tell
her
that
the
great
enemy
of
the
crown
was
dead
piece
by
which
she
meant
that
the
throne
should
at
once
reconcile
itself
with
the
house
of
lorraine
and
make
use
of
it
as
the
only
means
of
preventing
evil
results
from
the
hatred
of
the
guises
by
holding
out
to
them
the
hope
of
surrounding
the
king
but
the
persistent
craft
and
dissimulation
of
the
woman
and
the
italian
which
she
had
never
failed
to
employ
was
incompatible
with
the
debauched
life
of
her
son
catherine
de
medici
once
dead
the
policy
of
the
valois
died
also
before
undertaking
to
write
the
history
of
the
manners
and
morals
of
this
period
in
action
the
author
of
this
study
has
patiently
and
minutely
examined
the
principal
reigns
in
the
history
of
france
the
quarrel
of
the
burgundians
and
the
armagnacs
that
of
the
guises
and
the
valois
each
of
which
covers
a
century
his
first
intention
was
to
write
a
picturesque
history
of
france
three
women
isabella
of
bavaria
catharine
and
marie
de
medici
hold
an
enormous
place
in
it
their
sway
reaching
from
the
fourteenth
to
the
seventeenth
century
ending
in
louis
xiv
of
these
three
queens
catherine
is
the
finer
and
more
interesting
hers
was
virile
power
dishonored
neither
by
the
terrible
amours
of
isabella
nor
by
those
even
more
terrible
though
less
known
of
marie
de
medici
isabella
summoned
the
english
into
france
against
her
son
and
loved
her
the
duc
d
orleans
the
record
of
marie
de
medici
is
heavier
still
neither
had
political
genius
it
was
in
the
course
of
these
studies
that
the
writer
acquired
the
conviction
of
catherine
s
greatness
as
he
became
initiated
into
the
constantly
renewed
difficulties
of
her
position
he
saw
with
what
injustice
historians
all
influenced
by
protestants
had
treated
this
queen
out
of
this
conviction
grew
the
three
sketches
which
here
follow
in
which
some
erroneous
opinions
formed
upon
catherine
also
upon
the
persons
who
surrounded
her
and
on
the
events
of
her
time
are
refuted
if
this
book
is
placed
among
the
philosophical
studies
it
is
because
it
shows
the
spirit
of
a
time
and
because
we
may
clearly
see
in
it
the
influence
of
thought
but
before
entering
the
political
arena
where
catherine
will
be
seen
facing
the
two
great
difficulties
of
her
career
it
is
necessary
to
give
a
succinct
account
of
her
preceding
life
from
the
point
of
view
of
impartial
criticism
in
order
to
take
in
as
much
as
possible
of
this
vast
and
regal
existence
up
to
the
moment
when
the
first
part
of
the
present
study
begins
never
was
there
any
period
in
any
land
in
any
sovereign
family
a
greater
contempt
for
legitimacy
than
in
the
famous
house
of
the
medici
on
the
subject
of
power
they
held
the
same
doctrine
now
professed
by
russia
namely
to
whichever
head
the
crown
goes
he
is
the
true
the
legitimate
sovereign
mirabeau
had
reason
to
say
there
has
been
but
one
mesalliance
in
my
family
that
of
the
medici
for
in
spite
of
the
paid
efforts
of
genealogists
it
is
certain
that
the
medici
before
everardo
de
medici
of
florence
in
were
simple
florentine
merchants
who
became
very
rich
the
first
personage
in
this
family
who
occupies
an
important
place
in
the
history
of
the
famous
tuscan
republic
is
silvestro
de
medici
in
this
silvestro
had
two
sons
cosmo
and
lorenzo
de
medici
from
cosmo
are
descended
lorenzo
the
magnificent
the
duc
de
nemours
the
duc
d
urbino
father
of
catherine
pope
leo
pope
clement
and
alessandro
not
duke
of
florence
as
historians
call
him
but
duke
citta
di
a
title
given
by
pope
clement
as
a
station
to
that
of
of
tuscany
from
lorenzo
are
descended
the
florentine
brutus
lorenzino
who
killed
alessandro
cosmo
the
first
and
all
the
sovereigns
of
tuscany
till
at
which
period
the
house
became
extinct
but
neither
of
the
two
branches
the
branch
cosmo
and
the
branch
lorenzo
reigned
through
their
direct
and
legitimate
lines
until
the
close
of
the
sixteenth
century
when
the
of
tuscany
began
to
succeed
each
other
peacefully
alessandro
de
medici
he
to
whom
the
title
of
duke
citta
di
was
given
was
the
son
of
the
duke
d
urbino
catherine
s
father
by
a
moorish
slave
for
this
reason
lorenzino
claimed
a
double
right
to
kill
alessandro
as
a
usurper
in
his
house
as
well
as
an
oppressor
of
the
city
some
historians
believe
that
alessandro
was
the
son
of
clement
vii
the
fact
that
led
to
the
recognition
of
this
bastard
as
chief
of
the
republic
and
head
of
the
house
of
the
medici
was
his
marriage
with
margaret
of
austria
natural
daughter
of
charles
francesco
de
medici
husband
of
bianca
capello
accepted
as
his
son
a
child
of
poor
parents
bought
by
the
celebrated
venetian
and
strange
to
say
ferdinando
on
succeeding
francesco
maintained
the
substituted
child
in
all
his
rights
that
child
called
antonio
de
medici
was
considered
during
four
reigns
as
belonging
to
the
family
he
won
the
affection
of
everybody
rendered
important
services
to
the
family
and
died
universally
regretted
nearly
all
the
first
medici
had
natural
children
whose
careers
were
invariably
brilliant
for
instance
the
cardinal
giulio
de
medici
afterwards
pope
under
the
name
of
clement
was
the
illegitimate
son
of
giuliano
cardinal
ippolito
de
medici
was
also
a
bastard
and
came
very
near
being
pope
and
the
head
of
the
family
lorenzo
the
father
of
catherine
married
in
for
his
second
wife
madeleine
de
la
tour
de
boulogne
in
auvergne
and
died
april
a
few
days
after
his
wife
who
died
in
giving
birth
to
catherine
catherine
was
therefore
orphaned
of
father
and
mother
as
soon
as
she
drew
breath
hence
the
strange
adventures
of
her
childhood
mixed
up
as
they
were
with
the
bloody
efforts
of
the
florentines
then
seeking
to
recover
their
liberty
from
the
medici
the
latter
desirous
of
continuing
to
reign
in
florence
behaved
with
such
circumspection
that
lorenzo
catherine
s
father
had
taken
the
name
of
duke
d
urbino
at
lorenzo
s
death
the
head
of
the
house
of
the
medici
was
pope
leo
who
sent
the
illegitimate
son
of
giuliano
giulio
de
medici
then
cardinal
to
govern
florence
leo
was
to
catherine
and
this
cardinal
giulio
afterward
clement
was
her
uncle
by
the
left
hand
it
was
during
the
siege
of
florence
undertaken
by
the
medici
to
force
their
return
there
that
the
republican
party
not
content
with
having
shut
catherine
then
nine
years
old
into
a
convent
after
robbing
her
of
all
her
property
actually
proposed
on
the
suggestion
of
one
named
batista
cei
to
expose
her
between
two
battlements
on
the
walls
to
the
artillery
of
the
medici
bernardo
castiglione
went
further
in
a
council
held
to
determine
how
matters
should
be
ended
he
was
of
opinion
that
so
far
from
returning
her
to
the
pope
as
the
latter
requested
she
ought
to
be
given
to
the
soldiers
for
dishonor
this
will
show
how
all
popular
revolutions
resemble
each
other
catherine
s
subsequent
policy
which
upheld
so
firmly
the
royal
power
may
well
have
been
instigated
in
part
by
such
scenes
of
which
an
italian
girl
of
nine
years
of
age
was
assuredly
not
ignorant
the
rise
of
alessandro
de
medici
to
which
the
bastard
pope
clement
vii
powerfully
contributed
was
no
doubt
chiefly
caused
by
the
affection
of
charles
for
his
famous
illegitimate
daughter
margaret
thus
pope
and
emperor
were
prompted
by
the
same
sentiment
at
this
epoch
venice
had
the
commerce
of
the
world
rome
had
its
moral
government
italy
still
reigned
supreme
through
the
poets
the
generals
the
statesmen
born
to
her
at
no
period
of
the
world
s
history
in
any
land
was
there
ever
seen
so
remarkable
so
abundant
a
collection
of
men
of
genius
there
were
so
many
in
fact
that
even
the
lesser
princes
were
superior
men
italy
was
crammed
with
talent
enterprise
knowledge
science
poesy
wealth
and
gallantry
all
the
while
torn
by
intestinal
warfare
and
overrun
with
conquerors
struggling
for
possession
of
her
finest
provinces
when
men
are
so
strong
they
do
not
fear
to
admit
their
weaknesses
hence
no
doubt
this
golden
age
for
bastards
we
must
moreover
do
the
illegitimate
children
of
the
house
of
the
medici
the
justice
to
say
that
they
were
ardently
devoted
to
the
glory
power
and
increase
of
wealth
of
that
famous
family
thus
as
soon
as
the
della
citta
di
son
of
the
moorish
woman
was
installed
as
tyrant
of
florence
he
espoused
the
interest
of
pope
clement
and
gave
a
home
to
the
daughter
of
lorenzo
then
eleven
years
of
age
when
we
study
the
march
of
events
and
that
of
men
in
this
curious
sixteenth
century
we
ought
never
to
forget
that
public
policy
had
for
its
element
a
perpetual
craftiness
and
a
dissimulation
which
destroyed
in
all
characters
the
straightforward
upright
bearing
our
imaginations
demand
of
eminent
personages
in
this
above
all
is
catherine
s
absolution
it
disposes
of
the
vulgar
and
foolish
accusations
of
treachery
launched
against
her
by
the
writers
of
the
reformation
this
was
the
great
age
of
that
statesmanship
the
code
of
which
was
written
by
macchiavelli
as
well
as
by
spinosa
by
hobbes
as
well
as
by
montesquieu
for
the
dialogue
between
sylla
and
eucrates
contains
montesquieu
s
true
thought
which
his
connection
with
the
encyclopedists
did
not
permit
him
to
develop
otherwise
than
as
he
did
these
principles
are
the
secret
law
of
all
cabinets
in
which
plans
for
the
conquest
and
maintenance
of
great
power
are
laid
in
france
we
blamed
napoleon
when
he
made
use
of
that
italian
genius
for
craft
which
was
bred
in
his
bone
though
in
his
case
it
did
not
always
succeed
but
charles
catherine
philip
and
pope
julius
would
not
have
acted
otherwise
than
as
he
did
in
the
affair
of
spain
history
in
the
days
when
catherine
was
born
if
judged
from
the
point
of
view
of
honesty
would
seem
an
impossible
tale
charles
obliged
to
sustain
catholicism
against
the
attacks
of
luther
who
threatened
the
throne
in
threatening
the
tiara
allowed
the
siege
of
rome
and
held
pope
clement
vii
in
prison
this
same
clement
who
had
no
bitterer
enemy
than
charles
courted
him
in
order
to
make
alessandro
de
medici
ruler
of
florence
and
obtained
his
favorite
daughter
for
that
bastard
no
sooner
was
alessandro
established
than
he
conjointly
with
clement
endeavored
to
injure
charles
by
allying
himself
with
francois
king
of
france
by
means
of
catherine
de
medici
and
both
of
them
promised
to
assist
francois
in
reconquering
italy
lorenzino
de
medici
made
himself
the
companion
of
alessandro
s
debaucheries
for
the
express
purpose
of
finding
an
opportunity
to
kill
him
filippo
strozzi
one
of
the
great
minds
of
that
day
held
this
murder
in
such
respect
that
he
swore
that
his
sons
should
each
marry
a
daughter
of
the
murderer
and
each
son
religiously
fulfilled
his
father
s
oath
when
they
might
all
have
made
under
catherine
s
protection
brilliant
marriages
for
one
was
the
rival
of
doria
the
other
a
marshal
of
france
cosmo
de
medici
successor
of
alessandro
with
whom
he
had
no
relationship
avenged
the
death
of
that
tyrant
in
the
cruellest
manner
with
a
persistency
lasting
twelve
years
during
which
time
his
hatred
continued
keen
against
the
persons
who
had
as
a
matter
of
fact
given
him
the
power
he
was
eighteen
years
old
when
called
to
the
sovereignty
his
first
act
was
to
declare
the
rights
of
alessandro
s
legitimate
sons
null
and
void
all
the
while
avenging
their
father
s
death
charles
confirmed
the
disinheriting
of
his
grandsons
and
recognized
cosmo
instead
of
the
son
of
alessandro
and
his
daughter
margaret
cosmo
placed
on
the
throne
by
cardinal
cibo
instantly
exiled
the
latter
and
the
cardinal
revenged
himself
by
accusing
cosmo
who
was
the
first
of
murdering
alessandro
s
son
cosmo
as
jealous
of
his
power
as
charles
was
of
his
abdicated
in
favor
of
his
son
francesco
after
causing
the
death
of
his
other
son
garcia
to
avenge
the
death
of
cardinal
giovanni
de
medici
whom
garcia
had
assassinated
cosmo
the
first
and
his
son
francesco
who
ought
to
have
been
devoted
body
and
soul
to
the
house
of
france
the
only
power
on
which
they
might
really
have
relied
made
themselves
the
lacqueys
of
charles
and
philip
and
were
consequently
the
secret
base
and
perfidious
enemies
of
catherine
de
medici
one
of
the
glories
of
their
house
such
were
the
leading
contradictory
and
illogical
traits
the
treachery
knavery
and
black
intrigues
of
a
single
house
that
of
the
medici
from
this
sketch
we
may
judge
of
the
other
princes
of
italy
and
europe
all
the
envoys
of
cosmos
to
the
court
of
france
had
in
their
secret
instructions
an
order
to
poison
strozzi
catherine
s
relation
when
he
arrived
charles
had
already
assassinated
three
of
the
ambassadors
of
francois
i
it
was
early
in
the
month
of
october
that
the
della
citta
di
started
from
florence
for
livorno
accompanied
by
the
sole
heiress
of
lorenzo
namely
catherine
de
medici
the
duke
and
the
princess
of
florence
for
that
was
the
title
by
which
the
young
girl
then
fourteen
years
of
age
was
known
left
the
city
surrounded
by
a
large
retinue
of
servants
officers
and
secretaries
preceded
by
armed
men
and
followed
by
an
escort
of
cavalry
the
young
princess
knew
nothing
as
yet
of
what
her
fate
was
to
be
except
that
the
pope
was
to
have
an
interview
at
livorno
with
the
duke
alessandro
but
her
uncle
filippo
strozzi
very
soon
informed
her
of
the
future
before
her
filippo
strozzi
had
married
clarice
de
medici
on
the
father
s
side
of
lorenzo
de
medici
duke
of
urbino
father
of
catherine
but
this
marriage
which
was
brought
about
as
much
to
convert
one
of
the
firmest
supporters
of
the
popular
party
to
the
cause
of
the
medici
as
to
facilitate
the
recall
of
that
family
then
banished
from
florence
never
shook
the
stern
champion
from
his
course
though
he
was
persecuted
by
his
own
party
for
making
it
in
spite
of
all
apparent
changes
in
his
conduct
for
this
alliance
naturally
affected
it
somewhat
he
remained
faithful
to
the
popular
party
and
declared
himself
openly
against
the
medici
as
soon
as
he
foresaw
their
intention
to
enslave
florence
this
great
man
even
refused
the
offer
of
a
principality
made
to
him
by
leo
x
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
now
writing
filippo
strozzi
was
a
victim
to
the
policy
of
the
medici
so
vacillating
in
its
means
so
fixed
and
inflexible
in
its
object
after
sharing
the
misfortunes
and
the
captivity
of
clement
vii
when
the
latter
surprised
by
the
colonna
took
refuge
in
the
castle
of
strozzi
was
delivered
up
by
clement
as
a
hostage
and
taken
to
naples
as
the
pope
when
he
got
his
liberty
turned
savagely
on
his
enemies
strozzi
came
very
near
losing
his
life
and
was
forced
to
pay
an
enormous
sum
to
be
released
from
a
prison
where
he
was
closely
confined
when
he
found
himself
at
liberty
he
had
with
an
instinct
of
kindness
natural
to
an
honest
man
the
simplicity
to
present
himself
before
clement
who
had
perhaps
congratulated
himself
on
being
well
rid
of
him
the
pope
had
such
good
cause
to
blush
for
his
own
conduct
that
he
received
strozzi
extremely
strozzi
thus
began
early
in
life
his
apprenticeship
in
the
misfortunes
of
an
honest
man
in
politics
a
man
whose
conscience
can
not
lend
itself
to
the
capriciousness
of
events
whose
actions
are
acceptable
only
to
the
virtuous
and
who
is
therefore
persecuted
by
the
world
by
the
people
for
opposing
their
blind
passions
by
power
for
opposing
its
usurpations
the
life
of
such
great
citizens
is
a
martyrdom
in
which
they
are
sustained
only
by
the
voice
of
their
conscience
and
an
heroic
sense
of
social
duty
which
dictates
their
course
in
all
things
there
were
many
such
men
in
the
republic
of
florence
all
as
great
as
strozzi
and
as
able
as
their
adversaries
the
medici
though
vanquished
by
the
superior
craft
and
wiliness
of
the
latter
what
could
be
more
worthy
of
admiration
than
the
conduct
of
the
chief
of
the
pazzi
at
the
time
of
the
conspiracy
of
his
house
when
his
commerce
being
at
that
time
enormous
he
settled
all
his
accounts
with
asia
the
levant
and
europe
before
beginning
that
great
attempt
so
that
if
it
failed
his
correspondents
should
lose
nothing
the
history
of
the
establishment
of
the
house
of
the
medici
in
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
is
a
magnificent
tale
which
still
remains
to
be
written
though
men
of
genius
have
already
put
their
hands
to
it
it
is
not
the
history
of
a
republic
nor
of
a
society
nor
of
any
special
civilization
it
is
the
history
of
the
eternal
history
of
politics
that
of
usurpers
that
of
conquerors
as
soon
as
filippo
strozzi
returned
to
florence
he
the
preceding
form
of
government
and
ousted
ippolito
de
medici
another
bastard
and
the
very
alessandro
with
whom
at
the
later
period
of
which
we
are
now
writing
he
was
travelling
to
livorno
having
completed
this
change
of
government
he
became
alarmed
at
the
evident
inconstancy
of
the
people
of
florence
and
fearing
the
vengeance
of
clement
he
went
to
lyon
to
superintend
a
vast
house
of
business
he
owned
there
which
corresponded
with
other
of
his
own
in
venice
rome
france
and
spain
here
we
find
a
strange
thing
these
men
who
bore
the
weight
of
public
affairs
and
of
such
a
struggle
as
that
with
the
medici
not
to
speak
of
contentions
with
their
own
party
found
time
and
strength
to
bear
the
burden
of
a
vast
business
and
all
its
speculations
also
of
banks
and
their
complications
which
the
multiplicity
of
coinages
and
their
falsification
rendered
even
more
difficult
than
it
is
in
our
day
the
name
banker
comes
from
the
anglice
upon
which
the
banker
sat
and
on
which
he
rang
the
gold
and
silver
pieces
to
try
their
quality
after
a
time
filippo
found
in
the
death
of
his
wife
whom
he
adored
a
pretext
for
renewing
his
relations
with
the
republican
party
whose
secret
police
becomes
the
more
terrible
in
all
republics
because
every
one
makes
himself
a
spy
in
the
name
of
a
liberty
which
justifies
everything
filippo
returned
to
florence
at
the
very
moment
when
that
city
was
compelled
to
adopt
the
yoke
of
alessandro
but
he
had
previously
gone
to
rome
and
seen
pope
clement
whose
affairs
were
now
so
prosperous
that
his
disposition
toward
strozzi
was
much
changed
in
the
hour
of
triumph
the
medici
were
so
much
in
need
of
a
man
like
filippo
were
it
only
to
smooth
the
return
of
alessandro
that
clement
urged
him
to
take
a
seat
at
the
council
of
the
bastard
who
was
about
to
oppress
the
city
and
strozzi
consented
to
accept
the
diploma
of
a
senator
but
for
the
last
two
years
and
more
he
had
seen
like
seneca
and
burrhus
the
beginnings
of
tyranny
in
his
nero
he
felt
himself
at
the
moment
of
which
we
write
an
object
of
so
much
distrust
on
the
part
of
the
people
and
so
suspected
by
the
medici
whom
he
was
constantly
resisting
that
he
was
confident
of
some
impending
catastrophe
consequently
as
soon
as
he
heard
from
alessandro
of
the
negotiation
for
catherine
s
marriage
with
the
son
of
francois
the
final
arrangements
for
which
were
to
be
made
at
livorno
where
the
negotiators
had
appointed
to
meet
he
formed
the
plan
of
going
to
france
and
attaching
himself
to
the
fortunes
of
his
niece
who
needed
a
guardian
alessandro
delighted
to
rid
himself
of
a
man
so
unaccommodating
in
the
affairs
of
florence
furthered
a
plan
which
relieved
him
of
one
murder
at
least
and
advised
strozzi
to
put
himself
at
the
head
of
catherine
s
household
in
order
to
dazzle
the
eyes
of
france
the
medici
had
selected
a
brilliant
suite
for
her
whom
they
styled
very
unwarrantably
the
princess
of
florence
and
who
also
went
by
the
name
of
the
little
duchess
d
urbino
the
cortege
at
the
head
of
which
rode
alessandro
catherine
and
strozzi
was
composed
of
more
than
a
thousand
persons
not
including
the
escort
and
servants
when
the
last
of
it
issued
from
the
gates
of
florence
the
head
had
passed
that
first
village
beyond
the
city
where
they
now
braid
the
tuscan
straw
hats
it
was
beginning
to
be
rumored
among
the
people
that
catherine
was
to
marry
a
son
of
francois
but
the
rumor
did
not
obtain
much
belief
until
the
tuscans
beheld
with
their
own
eyes
this
triumphal
procession
from
florence
to
livorno
catherine
herself
judging
by
all
the
preparations
she
beheld
began
to
suspect
that
her
marriage
was
in
question
and
her
uncle
then
revealed
to
her
the
fact
that
the
first
ambitious
project
of
his
house
had
aborted
and
that
the
hand
of
the
dauphin
had
been
refused
to
her
alessandro
still
hoped
that
the
duke
of
albany
would
succeed
in
changing
this
decision
of
the
king
of
france
who
willing
as
he
was
to
buy
the
support
of
the
medici
in
italy
would
only
grant
them
his
second
son
the
duc
d
orleans
this
petty
blunder
lost
italy
to
france
and
did
not
prevent
catherine
from
becoming
queen
the
duke
of
albany
son
of
alexander
stuart
brother
of
james
king
of
scotland
had
married
anne
de
la
tour
de
boulogne
sister
of
madeleine
de
la
tour
de
boulogne
catherine
s
mother
he
was
therefore
her
maternal
uncle
it
was
through
her
mother
that
catherine
was
so
rich
and
allied
to
so
many
great
families
for
strangely
enough
her
rival
diane
de
poitiers
was
also
her
cousin
jean
de
poitiers
father
of
diane
was
son
of
jeanne
de
boulogne
aunt
of
the
duchess
d
urbino
catherine
was
also
a
cousin
of
mary
stuart
her
catherine
now
learned
that
her
dowry
in
money
was
a
hundred
thousand
ducats
a
ducat
was
a
gold
piece
of
the
size
of
an
old
french
louis
though
less
thick
the
old
louis
was
worth
francs
the
present
one
is
worth
twenty
the
comtes
of
auvergne
and
lauraguais
were
also
made
a
part
of
the
dowry
and
pope
clement
added
one
hundred
thousand
ducats
in
jewels
precious
stones
and
other
wedding
gifts
to
which
alessandro
likewise
contributed
his
share
on
arriving
at
livorno
catherine
still
so
young
must
have
been
flattered
by
the
extreme
magnificence
displayed
by
pope
clement
her
uncle
in
then
head
of
the
house
of
the
medici
in
order
to
outdo
the
court
of
france
he
had
already
arrived
at
livorno
in
one
of
his
galleys
which
was
lined
with
crimson
satin
fringed
with
gold
and
covered
with
a
awning
in
cloth
of
gold
this
galley
the
decoration
of
which
cost
twenty
thousand
ducats
contained
several
apartments
destined
for
the
bride
of
henri
of
france
all
of
which
were
furnished
with
the
richest
treasures
of
art
the
medici
could
collect
the
rowers
magnificently
apparelled
and
the
crew
were
under
the
command
of
a
prior
of
the
order
of
the
knights
of
rhodes
the
household
of
the
pope
were
in
three
other
galleys
the
galleys
of

duke
of
albany
anchored
near
those
of
clement
added
to
the
size
and
dignity
of
the
flotilla
duke
alessandro
presented
the
officers
of
catherine
s
household
to
the
pope
with
whom
he
had
a
secret
conference
in
which
it
would
appear
he
presented
to
his
holiness
count
sebastiano
montecuculi
who
had
just
left
somewhat
abruptly
the
service
of
charles
and
that
of
his
two
generals
antonio
di
leyva
and
ferdinando
di
gonzago
was
there
between
the
two
bastards
giulio
and
alessandro
a
premeditated
intention
of
making
the
duc
d
orleans
dauphin
what
reward
was
promised
to
sebastiano
montecuculi
who
before
entering
the
service
of
charles
had
studied
medicine
history
is
silent
on
that
point
we
shall
see
presently
what
clouds
hang
round
that
fact
the
obscurity
is
so
great
that
quite
recently
grave
and
conscientious
historians
have
admitted
montecuculi
s
innocence
catherine
then
heard
officially
from
the
pope
s
own
lips
of
the
alliance
reserved
for
her
the
duke
of
albany
had
been
able
to
do
no
more
than
hold
the
king
of
france
and
that
with
difficulty
to
his
promise
of
giving
catherine
the
hand
of
his
second
son
the
duc
d
orleans
the
pope
s
impatience
was
so
great
and
he
was
so
afraid
that
his
plans
would
be
thwarted
either
by
some
intrigue
of
the
emperor
or
by
the
refusal
of
france
or
by
the
grandees
of
the
kingdom
looking
with
evil
eye
upon
the
marriage
that
he
gave
orders
to
embark
at
once
and
sailed
for
marseille
where
he
arrived
toward
the
end
of
october
notwithstanding
its
wealth
the
house
of
the
medici
was
eclipsed
on
this
occasion
by
the
court
of
france
to
show
the
lengths
to
which
the
medici
pushed
their
magnificence
it
is
enough
to
say
that
the
dozen
put
into
the
bride
s
purse
by
the
pope
were
twelve
gold
medals
of
priceless
historical
value
which
were
then
unique
but
francois
who
loved
the
display
of
festivals
distinguished
himself
on
this
occasion
the
wedding
festivities
of
henri
de
valois
and
catherine
de
medici
lasted
days
it
is
useless
to
repeat
the
details
which
have
been
given
in
all
the
histories
of
provence
and
marseille
as
to
this
celebrated
interview
between
the
pope
and
the
king
of
france
which
was
opened
by
a
jest
of
the
duke
of
albany
as
to
the
duty
of
keeping
fasts
a
jest
mentioned
by
brantome
and
much
enjoyed
by
the
court
which
shows
the
tone
of
the
manners
of
that
day
many
conjectures
have
been
made
as
to
catherine
s
barrenness
which
lasted
ten
years
strange
calumnies
still
rest
upon
this
queen
all
of
whose
actions
were
fated
to
be
misjudged
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
the
cause
was
solely
in
henri
ii
after
the
difficulty
was
removed
catherine
had
ten
children
the
delay
was
in
one
respect
fortunate
for
france
if
henri
ii
had
had
children
by
diane
de
poitiers
the
politics
of
the
kingdom
would
have
been
dangerously
complicated
when
the
difficulty
was
removed
the
duchesse
de
valentinois
had
reached
the
period
of
a
woman
s
second
youth
this
matter
alone
will
show
that
the
true
life
of
catherine
de
medici
is
still
to
be
written
and
also
as
napoleon
said
with
profound
wisdom
that
the
history
of
france
should
be
either
in
one
volume
only
or
one
thousand
here
is
a
contemporaneous
and
succinct
account
of
the
meeting
of
clement
vii
and
the
king
of
france
his
holiness
the
pope
having
been
conducted
to
the
palace
which
was
as
i
have
said
prepared
beyond
the
port
every
one
retired
to
their
own
quarters
till
the
morrow
when
his
holiness
was
to
make
his
entry
the
which
was
made
with
great
sumptuousness
and
magnificence
he
being
seated
in
a
chair
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
two
men
and
wearing
his
pontifical
robes
but
not
the
tiara
pacing
before
him
was
a
white
hackney
bearing
the
sacrament
of
the
altar
the
said
hackney
being
led
by
reins
of
white
silk
held
by
two
footmen
finely
equipped
next
came
all
the
cardinals
in
their
robes
on
pontifical
mules
and
madame
la
duchesse
d
urbino
in
great
magnificence
accompanied

a
vast
number

and
gentlemen

french
and
italian
the
holy
father
having
arrived
in
the
midst
of
this
company
at
the
place
appointed
for
his
lodging
every
one
retired
and
all
this
being
took
place
without
disorder
or
tumult
while
the
pope
was
thus
making
his
entry
the
king
crossed
the
water
in
a
frigate
and
went
to
the
lodging
the
pope
had
just
quitted
in
order
to
go
the
next
day
and
make
obeisance
to
the
holy
father
as
a
most
christian
king
the
next
day
the
king
being
prepared
set
forth
for
the
palace
where
was
the
pope
accompanied
by
the
princes
of
the
blood
such
as
monseigneur
le
duc
de
vendomois
father
of
the
vidame
de
chartres
the
comte
de
messieurs
de
montpensier
and
la
the
duc
de
nemours
brother
of
the
duc
de
savoie
who
died
in
this
said
place
the
duke
of
albany
and
many
others
whether
counts
barons
or
seigneurs
nearest
to
the
king
was
the
seigneur
de
montmorency
his
the
king
being
arrived
at
the
palace
was
received
by
the
pope
and
all
the
college
of
cardinals
assembled
in
consistory
most
civilly
this
done
each
retired
to
the
place
ordained
for
him
the
king
taking
with
him
several
cardinals
to
feast
them
among
them
cardinal
de
medici
nephew
of
the
pope
a
very
splendid
man
with
a
fine
retinue
on
the
morrow
those
persons
chosen
by
his
holiness
and
by
the
king
began
to
assemble
to
discuss
the
matters
for
which
the
meeting
was
made
first
the
matter
of
the
faith
was
treated
of
and
a
bull
was
put
forth
repressing
heresy
and
preventing
that
things
come
to
greater
combustion
than
they
now
are
after
this
was
concluded
the
marriage
of
the
duc
d
orleans
second
son
of
the
king
with
catherine
de
medici
duchesse
d
urbino
niece
of
his
holiness
under
the
conditions
such
or
like
to
those
as
were
proposed
formerly
by
the
duke
of
albany
the
said
espousals
were
celebrated
with
great
magnificence
and
our
holy
father
himself
wedded
the
pair
the
marriage
thus
consummated
the
holy
father
held
a
consistory
at
which
he
created
four
cardinals
and
devoted
them
to
the
king
to
wit
cardinal
le
veneur
formerly
bishop
of
lisieux
and
grand
almoner
the
cardinal
de
boulogne
of
the
family
of
la
chambre
brother
on
the
mother
s
side
of
the
duke
of
albany
the
cardinal
de
chatillon
of
the
house
of
coligny
nephew
of
the
sire
de
montmorency
and
the
cardinal
de
when
strozzi
delivered
the
dowry
in
presence
of
the
court
he
noticed
some
surprise
on
the
part
of
the
french
seigneurs
they
even
said
aloud
that
it
was
little
enough
for
such
a
mesalliance
what
would
they
have
said
in
these
days
cardinal
ippolito
replied
saying
you
must
be
as
to
the
secrets
of
your
king
his
holiness
has
bound
himself
to
give
to
france
three
pearls
of
inestimable
value
namely
genoa
milan
and
the
pope
left
sebastiano
montecuculi
to
present
himself
to
the
court
of
france
to
which
the
count
offered
his
services
complaining
of
his
treatment
by
antonio
di
leyva
and
ferdinando
di
gonzago
for
which
reason
his
services
were
accepted
montecuculi
was
not
made
a
part
of
catherine
s
household
which
was
wholly
composed
of
french
men
and
women
for
by
a
law
of
the
monarchy
the
execution
of
which
the
pope
saw
with
great
satisfaction
catherine
was
naturalized
by
as
a
frenchwoman
before
the
marriage
montecuculi
was
appointed
in
the
first
instance
to
the
household
of
the
queen
the
sister
of
charles
after
a
while
he
passed
into
the
service
of
the
dauphin
as
the
new
duchesse
d
orleans
soon
found
herself
a
nullity
at
the
court
of
francois
i
her
young
husband
was
in
love
with
diane
de
poitiers
who
certainly
in
the
matter
of
birth
could
rival
catherine
and
was
far
more
of
a
great
lady
than
the
little
florentine
the
daughter
of
the
medici
was
also
outdone
by
queen
eleonore
sister
of
charles
and
by
madame
d
etampes
whose
marriage
with
the
head
of
the
house
of
brosse
made
her
one
of
the
most
powerful
and
best
titled
women
in
france
catherine
s
aunt
the
duchess
of
albany
the
queen
of
navarre
the
duchesse
de
guise
the
duchesse
de
vendome
madame
la
connetable
de
montmorency
and
other
women
of
like
importance
eclipsed
by
birth
and
by
their
rights
as
well
as
by
their
power
at
the
most
sumptuous
court
of
france
not
excepting
that
of
louis
xiv
the
daughter
of
the
florentine
grocers
who
was
richer
and
more
illustrious
through
the
house
of
the
tour
de
boulogne
than
by
her
own
family
of
medici
the
position
of
his
niece
was
so
bad
and
difficult
that
the
republican
filippo
strozzi
wholly
incapable
of
guiding
her
in
the
midst
of
such
conflicting
interests
left
her
after
the
first
year
being
recalled
to
italy
by
the
death
of
clement
vii
catherine
s
conduct
when
we
remember
that
she
was
scarcely
fifteen
years
old
was
a
model
of
prudence
she
attached
herself
closely
to
the
king
her
she
left
him
as
little
as
she
could
following
him
on
horseback
both
in
hunting
and
in
war
her
idolatry
for
francois
saved
the
house
of
the
medici
from
all
suspicion
when
the
dauphin
was
poisoned
catherine
was
then
and
so
was
her
husband
at
the
headquarters
of
the
king
in
provence
for
charles
had
speedily
invaded
france
and
the
late
scene
of
the
marriage
festivities
had
become
the
theatre
of
a
cruel
war
at
the
moment
when
charles
was
put
to
flight
leaving
the
bones
of
his
army
in
provence
the
dauphin
was
returning
to
lyon
by
the
rhone
he
stopped
to
sleep
at
tournon
and
by
way
of
pastime
practised
some
violent
physical
exercises
which
were
nearly
all
the
education
his
brother
and
he
in
consequence
of
their
detention
as
hostages
had
ever
received
the
prince
had
the
imprudence
it
being
the
month
of
august
and
the
weather
very
hot
to
ask
for
a
glass
of
water
which
montecuculi
as
his
gave
to
him
with
ice
in
it
the
dauphin
died
almost
immediately
francois
adored
his
son
the
dauphin
was
according
to
all
accounts
a
charming
young
man
his
father
in
despair
gave
the
utmost
publicity
to
the
proceedings
against
montecuculi
which
he
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
most
able
magistrates
of
that
day
the
count
after
heroically
enduring
the
first
tortures
without
confessing
anything
finally
made
admissions
by
which
he
implicated
charles
and
his
two
generals
antonio
di
leyva
and
ferdinando
di
gonzago
no
affair
was
ever
more
solemnly
debated
here
is
what
the
king
did
in
the
words
of
an
ocular
witness
the
king
called
an
assembly
at
lyon
of
all
the
princes
of
his
blood
all
the
knights
of
his
order
and
other
great
personages
of
the
kingdom
also
the
legal
and
papal
nuncio
the
cardinals
who
were
at
his
court
together
with
the
ambassadors
of
england
scotland
portugal
venice
ferrara
and
others
also
all
the
princes
and
noble
strangers
both
italian
and
german
who
were
then
residing
at
his
court
in
great
numbers
these
all
being
assembled
he
caused
to
be
read
to
them
in
presence
of
each
other
from
beginning
to
end
the
trial
of
the
unhappy
man
who
poisoned
monseigneur
the
late
dauphin
with
all
the
interrogatories
confessions
confrontings
and
other
ceremonies
usual
in
criminal
trials
he
the
king
not
being
willing
that
the
sentence
should
be
executed
until
all
present
had
given
their
opinion
on
this
heinous
and
miserable
the
fidelity
devotion
and
cautious
skill
of
the
comte
de
montecuculi
may
seem
extraordinary
in
our
time
when
all
the
world
even
ministers
of
state
tell
everything
about
the
least
little
event
with
which
they
have
to
do
but
in
those
days
princes
could
find
devoted
servants
or
knew
how
to
choose
them
monarchical
moreys
existed
because
in
those
days
there
was
never
ask
devotion
of
because
such
interest
may
change
but
expect
all
from
sentiments
religious
faith
monarchical
faith
patriotic
faith
those
three
beliefs
produced
such
men
as
the
berthereaus
of
geneva
the
sydneys
and
straffords
of
england
the
murderers
of
thomas
a
becket
the
jacques
coeurs
the
jeanne
d
arcs
the
richelieus
dantons
bonchamps
talmonts
and
also
the
clements
chabots
and
others
the
dauphin
was
poisoned
in
the
same
manner
and
possibly
by
the
same
drug
which
afterwards
served
madame
under
louis
xiv
pope
clement
vii
had
been
dead
two
years
duke
alessandro
plunged
in
debauchery
seemed
to
have
no
interest
in
the
elevation
of
the
duc
d
orleans
catherine
then
seventeen
and
full
of
admiration
for
her
was
with
him
at
the
time
charles
alone
appeared
to
have
an
interest
in
his
death
for
francois
was
negotiating
for
his
son
an
alliance
which
would
assuredly
have
aggrandized
france
the
count
s
confession
was
therefore
very
skilfully
based
on
the
passions
and
politics
of
the
moment
charles
was
then
flying
from
france
leaving
his
armies
buried
in
provence
with
his
happiness
his
reputation
and
his
hopes
of
dominion
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
if
torture
had
forced
admissions
from
an
innocent
man
francois
gave
montecuculi
full
liberty
to
speak
in
presence
of
an
imposing
assembly
and
before
persons
in
whose
eyes
innocence
had
some
chance
to
triumph
the
king
who
wanted
the
truth
sought
it
in
good
faith
in
spite
of
her
now
brilliant
future
catherine
s
situation
at
court
was
not
changed
by
the
death
of
the
dauphin
her
barrenness
gave
reason
to
fear
a
divorce
in
case
her
husband
should
ascend
the
throne
the
dauphin
was
under
the
spell
of
diane
de
poitiers
who
assumed
to
rival
madame
d
etampes
the
king
s
mistress
catherine
redoubled
in
care
and
cajolery
of
her
being
well
aware
that
her
sole
support
was
in
him
the
first
ten
years
of
catherine
s
married
life
were
years
of
grief
caused
by
the
failure
one
by
one
of
her
hopes
of
pregnancy
and
the
vexations
of
her
rivalry
with
diane
imagine
what
must
have
been
the
life
of
a
young
princess
watched
by
a
jealous
mistress
who
was
supported
by
a
powerful
party
the
catholic
party
and
by
the
two
powerful
alliances
diane
had
made
in
marrying
one
daughter
to
robert
de
la
mark
duc
de
bouillon
prince
of
sedan
and
the
other
to
claude
de
lorraine
duc
d
aumale
catherine
helpless
between
the
party
of
madame
d
etampes
and
the
party
of
the
senechale
such
was
diane
s
title
during
the
reign
of
francois
i
which
divided
the
court
and
politics
into
factions
for
these
mortal
enemies
endeavored
to
make
herself
the
friend
of
both
diane
de
poitiers
and
madame
d
etampes
she
who
was
destined
to
become
so
great
a
queen
played
the
part
of
a
servant
thus
she
served
her
apprenticeship
in
that
policy
which
was
ever
the
secret
motor
of
her
life
later
the
was
to
stand
between
catholics
and
calvinists
just
as
the
had
stood
for
ten
years
between
madame
d
etampes
and
madame
de
poitiers
she
studied
the
contradictions
of
french
politics
she
saw
francois
sustaining
calvin
and
the
lutherans
in
order
to
embarrass
charles
and
then
after
secretly
and
patiently
protecting
the
reformation
in
germany
and
tolerating
the
residence
of
calvin
at
the
court
of
navarre
he
suddenly
turned
against
it
with
excessive
rigor
catherine
beheld
on
the
one
hand
the
court
and
the
women
of
the
court
playing
with
the
fire
of
heresy
and
on
the
other
diane
at
the
head
of
the
catholic
party
with
the
guises
solely
because
the
duchesse
d
etampes
supported
calvin
and
the
protestants
such
was
the
political
education
of
this
queen
who
saw
in
the
cabinet
of
the
king
of
france
the
same
errors
committed
as
in
the
house
of
the
medici
the
dauphin
opposed
his
father
in
everything
he
was
a
bad
son
he
forgot
the
cruel
but
most
vital
maxim
of
royalty
namely
that
thrones
need
solidarity
and
that
a
son
who
creates
opposition
during
the
lifetime
of
his
father
must
follow
that
father
s
policy
when
he
mounts
the
throne
spinosa
who
was
as
great
a
statesman
as
he
was
a
philosopher
said
in
the
case
of
one
king
succeeding
another
by
insurrection
or
crime
if
the
new
king
desires
to
secure
the
safety
of
his
throne
and
of
his
own
life
he
must
show
such
ardor
in
avenging
the
death
of
his
predecessor
that
no
one
shall
feel
a
desire
to
commit
the
same
crime
but
to
avenge
it
it
is
not
enough
to
shed
the
blood
of
his
subjects
he
must
approve
the
axioms
of
the
king
he
replaces
and
take
the
same
course
in
it
was
the
application
of
this
maxim
which
gave
florence
to
the
medici
cosmo
caused
to
be
assassinated
at
venice
after
eleven
years
sway
the
florentine
brutus
and
as
we
have
already
said
persecuted
the
strozzi
it
was
forgetfulness
of
this
maxim
which
ruined
louis
xvi
that
king
was
false
to
every
principle
of
royal
government
when
he
the
parliaments
suppressed
by
his
grandfather
louis
xv
saw
the
matter
clearly
the
parliaments
and
notably
that
of
paris
counted
for
fully
half
in
the
troubles
which
necessitated
the
convocation
of
the
the
fault
of
louis
xv
was
that
in
breaking
down
that
barrier
which
separated
the
throne
from
the
people
he
did
not
erect
a
stronger
in
other
words
that
he
did
not
substitute
for
parliament
a
strong
constitution
of
the
provinces
there
lay
the
remedy
for
the
evils
of
the
monarchy
thence
should
have
come
the
voting
on
taxes
the
regulation
of
them
and
a
slow
approval
of
reforms
that
were
necessary
to
the
system
of
monarchy
the
first
act
of
henri
ii
was
to
give
his
confidence
to
the
connetable
de
montmorency
whom
his
father
had
enjoined
him
to
leave
in
disgrace
the
connetable
de
montmorency
was
with
diane
de
poitiers
to
whom
he
was
closely
bound
the
master
of
the
state
catherine
was
therefore
less
happy
and
less
powerful
after
she
became
queen
of
france
than
while
she
was
dauphiness
from
she
had
a
child
every
year
for
ten
years
and
was
occupied
with
maternal
cares
during
the
period
covered
by
the
last
three
years
of
the
reign
of
francois
and
nearly
the
whole
of
the
reign
of
henri
ii
we
may
see
in
this
recurring
fecundity
the
influence
of
a
rival
who
was
able
thus
to
rid
herself
of
the
legitimate
wife
a
barbarity
of
feminine
policy
which
must
have
been
one
of
catherine
s
grievances
against
diane
thus
set
aside
from
public
life
this
superior
woman
passed
her
time
in
observing
the
of
the
court
people
and
of
the
various
parties
which
were
formed
about
her
all
the
italians
who
had
followed
her
were
objects
of
violent
suspicion
after
the
execution
of
montecuculi
the
connetable
de
montmorency
diane
and
many
of
the
keenest
politicians
of
the
court
were
filled
with
suspicion
of
the
medici
though
francois
always
repelled
it
consequently
the
gondi
strozzi
ruggieri
sardini
in
short
all
those
who
were
called
distinctively
the
italians
were
compelled
to
employ
greater
resources
of
mind
shrewd
policy
and
courage
to
maintain
themselves
at
court
against
the
weight
of
disfavor
which
pressed
upon
them
during
her
husband
s
reign
catherine
s
amiability
to
diane
de
poitiers
went
to
such
great
lengths
that
intelligent
persons
must
regard
it
as
proof
of
that
profound
dissimulation
which
men
events
and
the
conduct
of
henri
ii
compelled
catherine
de
medici
to
employ
but
they
go
too
far
when
they
declare
that
she
never
claimed
her
rights
as
wife
and
queen
in
the
first
place
the
sense
of
dignity
which
catherine
possessed
in
the
highest
degree
forbade
her
claiming
what
historians
call
her
rights
as
a
wife
the
ten
children
of
the
marriage
explain
henri
s
conduct
and
his
wife
s
maternal
occupations
left
him
free
to
pass
his
time
with
diane
de
poitiers
but
the
king
was
never
lacking
in
anything
that
was
due
to
himself
and
he
gave
catherine
an
entry
into
paris
to
be
crowned
as
queen
which
was
worthy
of
all
such
pageants
that
had
ever
taken
place
the
archives
of
the
parliament
and
those
of
the
cour
des
comptes
show
that
those
two
great
bodies
went
to
meet
her
outside
of
paris
as
far
as
saint
lazare
here
is
an
extract
from
du
tillet
s
account
of
it
a
platform
had
been
erected
at
on
which
was
a
throne
du

calls
it
a

catherine
took
her
seat
upon
it
wearing
a
surcoat
or
species
of
ermine
covered
with
precious
stones
a
bodice
beneath
it
with
the
royal
mantle
and
on
her
head
a
crown
enriched
with
pearls
and
diamonds
and
held
in
place
by
the
marechale
de

her
lady
of
honor
around
her
the
princes
of
the

and
other
princes
and
seigneurs
richly
apparelled
also
the
chancellor
of
france
in
a
robe
of
gold
damask
on
a
background
of
before
the
queen
and
on
the
same
platform
were
seated
in
two
rows
twelve
duchesses
or
countesses
wearing
ermine
surcoats
bodices
robes
and
circlets
that
is
to
say
the

of

afterwards
duchesse

and
mademoiselle

without
mentioning
other

who
were
not

the
four
presidents
of
the
courts
of
justice
wearing
their
caps
several
other
members
of
the
court
and
the
clerk
du

mounted
the
platform
made
reverent
bows
and
the
chief
judge
lizet
kneeling
down
harangued
the
queen
the
chancellor
then
knelt
down
and
answered
the
queen
made
her
entry
at
three
o
clock
in
an
open
litter
having
madame
marguerite
de
france
sitting
opposite
to
her
and
on
either
side
of
the
litter
the
cardinals
of
amboise
chatillon
boulogne
and
de
lenoncourt
in
their
episcopal
robes
she
left
her
litter
at
the
church
of
where
she
was
received
by
the
clergy
after
offering
her
prayer
she
was
conducted
by
the
rue
de
la
calandre
to
the
palace
where
the
royal
supper
was
served
in
the
great
hall
she
there
appeared
seated
at
the
middle
of
the
marble
table
beneath
a
velvet
dais
strewn
with
golden
we
may
here
put
an
end
to
one
of
those
popular
beliefs
which
are
repeated
in
many
writers
from
sauval
down
it
has
been
said
that
henri
ii
pushed
his
neglect
of
the
proprieties
so
far
as
to
put
the
initials
of
his
mistress
on
the
buildings
which
catherine
advised
him
to
continue
or
to
begin
with
so
much
magnificence
but
the
double
monogram
which
can
be
seen
at
the
louvre
offers
a
daily
denial
to
those
who
are
so
little
as
to
believe
in
silly
nonsense
which
gratuitously
insults
our
kings
and
queens
the
h
or
henri
and
the
two
c
s
of
catherine
which
back
it
appear
to
represent
the
two
d
s
of
diane
the
coincidence
may
have
pleased
henri
but
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
the
royal
monogram
contained
officially
the
initial
of
the
king
and
that
of
the
queen
this
is
so
true
that
the
monogram
can
still
be
seen
on
the
column
of
the
halle
au
ble
which
was
built
by
catherine
alone
it
can
also
be
seen
in
the
crypt
of
on
the
tomb
which
catherine
erected
for
herself
in
her
lifetime
beside
that
of
henri
where
her
figure
is
modelled
from
nature
by
the
sculptor
to
whom
she
sat
for
it
on
a
solemn
occasion
when
he
was
starting
march
for
his
expedition
into
germany
henri
ii
declared
catherine
regent
during
his
absence
and
also
in
case
of
his
death
catherine
s
most
cruel
enemy
the
author
of
marvellous
discourses
on
catherine
the
second
s
behavior
admits
that
she
carried
on
the
government
with
universal
approval
and
that
the
king
was
satisfied
with
her
administration
henri
received
both
money
and
men
at
the
time
he
wanted
them
and
finally
after
the
fatal
day
of
catherine
obtained
considerable
sums
of
money
from
the
people
of
paris
which
she
sent
to
compiegne
where
the
king
then
was
in
politics
catherine
made
immense
efforts
to
obtain
a
little
influence
she
was
clever
enough
to
bring
the
connetable
de
montmorency
under
henri
to
her
interests
we
all
know
the
terrible
answer
that
the
king
made
on
being
harassed
by
montmorency
in
her
favor
this
answer
was
the
result
of
an
attempt
by
catherine
to
give
the
king
good
advice
in
the
few
moments
she
was
ever
alone
with
him
when
she
explained
the
florentine
policy
of
pitting
the
grandees
of
the
kingdom
one
against
another
and
establishing
the
royal
authority
on
their
ruins
but
henri
who
saw
things
only
through
the
eyes
of
diane
and
the
connetable
was
a
truly
feudal
king
and
the
friend
of
all
the
great
families
of
his
kingdom
after
the
futile
attempt
of
the
connetable
in
her
favor
which
must
have
been
made
in
the
year
catherine
began
to
cajole
the
guises
for
the
purpose
of
detaching
them
from
diane
and
opposing
them
to
the
connetable
unfortunately
diane
and
montmorency
were
as
vehement
against
the
protestants
as
the
guises
there
was
therefore
not
the
same
animosity
in
their
struggle
as
there
might
have
been
had
the
religious
question
entered
it
moreover
diane
boldly
entered
the
lists
against
the
queen
s
project
by
coquetting
with
the
guises
and
giving
her
daughter
to
the
duc
d
aumale
she
even
went
so
far
that
certain
authors
declared
she
gave
more
than
mere
to
the
gallant
cardinal
de
lorraine
and
the
lampooners
of
the
time
made
the
following
quatrain
on
henri
ii
sire
if
you
re
weak
and
let
your
will
relax
till
diane
and
lorraine
do
govern
you
pound
knead
and
mould
and
model
you
sire
you
are
nothing
nothing
else
than
it
is
impossible
to
regard
as
sincere
the
signs
of
grief
and
the
ostentation
of
mourning
which
catherine
showed
on
the
death
of
henri
ii
the
fact
that
the
king
was
attached
by
an
unalterable
passion
to
diane
de
poitiers
naturally
made
catherine
play
the
part
of
a
neglected
wife
who
adores
her
husband
but
like
all
women
who
act
by
their
head
she
persisted
in
this
dissimulation
and
never
ceased
to
speak
tenderly
of
henri
ii
in
like
manner
diane
as
we
know
wore
mourning
all
her
life
for
her
husband
the
senechal
de
breze
her
colors
were
black
and
white
and
the
king
was
wearing
them
at
the
tournament
when
he
was
killed
catherine
no
doubt
in
imitation
of
her
rival
wore
mourning
for
henri
ii
for
the
rest
of
her
life
she
showed
a
consummate
perfidy
toward
diane
de
poitiers
to
which
historians
have
not
given
due
attention
at
the
king
s
death
the
duchesse
de
valentinois
was
completely
disgraced
and
shamefully
abandoned
by
the
connetable
a
man
who
was
always
below
his
reputation
diane
offered
her
estate
and
chateau
of
chenonceaux
to
the
queen
catherine
then
said
in
presence
of
witnesses
i
can
never
forget
that
she
made
the
happiness
of
my
dear
henri
i
am
ashamed
to
accept
her
gift
i
wish
to
give
her
a
domain
in
place
of
it
and
i
shall
offer
her
that
of
accordingly
the
deed
of
exchange
was
signed
at
blois
in
diane
whose
were
the
duc
d
aumale
and
the
duc
de
bouillon
then
a
sovereign
prince
kept
her
wealth
and
died
in
aged
she
was
therefore
nineteen
years
older
than
henri
ii
these
dates
taken
from
her
epitaph
which
was
copied
from
her
tomb
by
the
historian
who
concerned
himself
so
much
about
her
at
the
close
of
the
last
century
clear
up
quite
a
number
of
historical
difficulties
some
historians
have
declared
she
was
forty
others
that
she
was
sixteen
at
the
time
of
her
father
s
condemnation
in
in
point
of
fact
she
was
then
after
reading
everything
for
and
against
her
conduct
towards
francois
we
are
unable
to
affirm
or
to
deny
anything
this
is
one
of
the
passages
of
history
that
will
ever
remain
obscure
we
may
see
by
what
happens
in
our
own
day
how
history
is
falsified
at
the
very
moment
when
events
happen
catherine
who
had
founded
great
hopes
on
the
age
of
her
rival
tried
more
than
once
to
overthrow
her
it
was
a
dumb
underhand
terrible
struggle
the
day
came
when
catherine
believed
herself
for
a
moment
on
the
verge
of
success
in
diane
who
was
ill
begged
the
king
to
go
to
and
leave
her
for
a
short
time
until
she
recovered
this
stately
coquette
did
not
choose
to
be
seen
in
the
midst
of
medical
appliances
and
without
the
splendors
of
apparel
catherine
arranged
as
a
welcome
to
her
husband
a
magnificent
ballet
in
which
six
beautiful
young
girls
were
to
recite
a
poem
in
his
honor
she
chose
for
this
function
miss
fleming
a
relation
of
her
uncle
the
duke
of
albany
the
handsomest
young
woman
some
say
that
was
ever
seen
white
and
very
fair
also
one
of
her
own
relations
clarice
strozzi
a
magnificent
italian
with
superb
black
hair
and
hands
that
were
of
rare
beauty
miss
lewiston
maid
of
honor
to
mary
stuart
mary
stuart
herself
madame
elizabeth
of
france
who
was
afterwards
that
unfortunate
queen
of
spain
and
madame
claude
elizabeth
and
claude
were
eight
and
nine
years
old
mary
stuart
twelve
evidently
the
queen
intended
to
bring
forward
miss
fleming
and
clarice
strozzi
and
present
them
without
rivals
to
the
king
the
king
fell
in
love
with
miss
fleming
by
whom
he
had
a
natural
son
henri
de
valois
comte
d
angouleme
of
france
but
the
power
and
influence
of
diane
were
not
shaken
like
madame
de
pompadour
with
louis
the
duchesse
de
valentinois
forgave
all
but
what
sort
of
love
did
this
attempt
show
in
catherine
was
it
love
to
her
husband
or
love
of
power
women
may
decide
a
great
deal
is
said
in
these
days
of
the
license
of
the
press
but
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
the
lengths
to
which
it
went
when
printing
was
first
invented
we
know
that
aretino
the
voltaire
of
his
time
made
kings
and
emperors
tremble
more
especially
charles
but
the
world
does
not
know
so
well
the
audacity
and
license
of
pamphlets
the
chateau
de
chenonceaux
which
we
have
just
mentioned
was
given
to
diane
or
rather
not
given
she
was
implored
to
accept
it
to
make
her
forget
one
of
the
most
horrible
publications
ever
levelled
against
a
woman
and
which
shows
the
violence
of
the
warfare
between
herself
and
madame
d
etampes
in
when
she
was
years
of
age
a
rhymester
of
champagne
named
jean
voute
published
a
collection
of
latin
verses
in
which
were
three
epigrams
upon
her
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
the
poet
was
sure
of
protection
in
high
places
for
the
pamphlet
has
a
preface
in
praise
of
itself
signed
by
salmon
macrin
first
to
the
king
only
one
passage
is
quotable
from
these
epigrams
which
are
entitled
in
pictaviam
anam
auligam
a
painted
trap
catches
no
game
says
the
poet
after
telling
diane
that
she
painted
her
face
and
bought
her
teeth
and
hair
you
may
buy
all
that
superficially
makes
a
woman

you
can

buy
that

were
somewhat
more
severe

queens

on
becoming
widows
were
required

without

of

they
did
not

until
after
the
burial
of

this
inviolable
custom
was
a
great
annoyance
to
catherine
who
feared
cabals
and
by
chance
she
found
a
means
to
evade
it
thus
cardinal
de

leaving
very
early
in
the
morning
the
house
of
the
a
celebrated
courtesan
of
the
period
who
lived
in
the
rue
was
set
upon
and
maltreated
by
a
party
of
libertines
on
which
his
holiness
being
much
astonished
says
henri
estienne
gave
out
that
the
heretics
were
preparing
ambushes
against
the
court
at
once
removed
from
paris
to
and
the
declaring
that
she
would
not
abandon
the
king
her
son
went
with
him
the
accession
of
francois
the
period
at
which
catherine
confidently
believed
she
could
get
possession
of
the
regal
power
was
a
moment
of
cruel
disappointment
after
the
years
of
misery
she
had
lived
through
at
the
court
of
france
the
guises
laid
hands
on
power
with
incredible
audacity
the
duc
de
guise
was
placed
in
command
of
the
army
the
connetable
was
dismissed
the
cardinal
took
charge
of
the
treasury
and
the
clergy
catherine
now
began
her
political
career
by
a
drama
which
though
it
did
not
have
the
dreadful
fame
of
those
of
later
years
was
nevertheless
most
horrible
and
it
must
undoubtedly
have
accustomed
her
to
the
terrible
after
emotions
of
her
life
while
appearing
to
be
in
harmony
with
the
guises
she
endeavored
to
pave
the
way
for
her
ultimate
triumph
by
seeking
a
support
in
the
house
of
bourbon
and
the
means
she
took
were
as
follows
whether
it
was
that
before
the
death
of
henri
ii
and
after
fruitlessly
attempting
violent
measures
she
wished
to
awaken
jealousy
in
order
to
bring
the
king
back
to
her
or
whether
as
she
approached
it
seemed
to
her
cruel
that
she
had
never
known
love
certain
it
is
that
she
showed
a
strong
interest
in
a
seigneur
of
the
royal
blood
francois
de
vendome
son
of
louis
de
vendome
the
house
from
which
that
of
the
bourbons
sprang
and
vidame
de
chartres
the
name
under
which
he
is
known
in
history
the
secret
hatred
which
catherine
bore
to
diane
was
revealed
in
many
ways
to
which
historians
preoccupied
by
political
interests
have
paid
no
attention
catherine
s
attachment
to
the
vidame
proceeded
from
the
fact
that
the
young
man
had
offered
an
insult
to
the
favorite
diane
s
greatest
ambition
was
for
the
honor
of
an
alliance
with
the
royal
family
of
france
the
hand
of
her
second
daughter
afterwards
duchesse
d
aumale
was
offered
on
her
behalf
to
the
vidame
de
chartres
who
was
kept
poor
by
the
policy
of
francois
i
in
fact
when
the
vidame
de
chartres
and
the
prince
de
conde
first
came
to
court
francois
gave
them
what
the
office
of
chamberlain
with
a
paltry
salary
of
twelve
hundred
crowns
a
year
the
same
that
he
gave
to
the
simplest
gentlemen
though
diane
de
poitiers
offered
an
immense
dowry
a
fine
office
under
the
crown
and
the
favor
of
the
king
the
vidame
refused
after
which
this
bourbon
already
factious
married
jeanne
daughter
of
the
baron
d
estissac
by
whom
he
had
no
children
this
act
of
pride
naturally
commended
him
to
catherine
who
greeted
him
after
that
with
marked
favor
and
made
a
devoted
friend
of
him
historians
have
compared
the
last
duc
de
montmorency
beheaded
at
toulouse
to
the
vidame
de
chartres
in
the
art
of
pleasing
in
attainments
accomplishments
and
talent
henri
ii
showed
no
jealousy
he
seemed
not
even
to
suppose
that
a
queen
of
france
could
fail
in
her
duty
or
a
medici
forget
the
honor
done
to
her
by
a
valois
but
during
this
time
when
the
queen
was
it
is
said
coquetting
with
the
vidame
de
chartres
the
king
after
the
birth
of
her
last
child
had
virtually
abandoned
her
this
attempt
at
making
him
jealous
was
to
no
purpose
for
henri
died
wearing
the
colors
of
diane
de
poitiers
at
the
time
of
the
king
s
death
catherine
was
therefore
on
terms
of
gallantry
with
the
vidame
a
situation
which
was
quite
in
conformity
with
the
manners
and
morals
of
a
time
when
love
was
both
so
chivalrous
and
so
licentious
that
the
noblest
actions
were
as
natural
as
the
most
blamable
although
historians
as
usual
have
committed
the
mistake
in
this
case
of
taking
the
exception
for
the
rule
the
four
sons
of
henri
ii
of
course
rendered
null
the
position
of
the
bourbons
who
were
all
extremely
poor
and
were
now
crushed
down
by
the
contempt
which
the
connetable
de
montmorency
s
treachery
brought
upon
them
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
latter
had
thought
best
to
fly
the
kingdom
the
vidame
de
chartres
who
was
to
the
first
prince
de
conde
what
richelieu
was
to
mazarin
his
father
in
policy
his
model
and
above
all
his
master
in
gallantry
concealed
the
excessive
ambition
of
his
house
beneath
an
external
appearance
of
gaiety
unable
during
the
reign
of
henri
ii
to
make
head
against
the
guises
the
montmorencys
the
scottish
princes
the
cardinals
and
the
bouillons
he
distinguished
himself
by
his
graceful
bearing
his
manners
his
wit
which
won
him
the
favor
of
many
charming
women
and
the
heart
of
some
for
whom
he
cared
nothing
he
was
one
of
those
privileged
beings
whose
seductions
are
irresistible
and
who
owe
to
love
the
power
of
maintaining
themselves
according
to
their
rank
the
bourbons
would
not
have
resented
as
did
jarnac
the
slander
of
la
chataigneraie
they
were
willing
enough
to
accept
the
lands
and
castles
of
their
mistresses
witness
the
prince
de
conde
who
accepted
the
estate
of
from
madame
la
marechale
de
during
the
first
twenty
days
of
mourning
after
the
death
of
henri
ii
the
situation
of
the
vidame
suddenly
changed
as
the
object
of
the
queen
mother
s
regard
and
permitted
to
pay
his
court
to
her
as
court
is
paid
to
a
queen
very
secretly
he
seemed
destined
to
play
an
important
role
and
catherine
did
in
fact
resolve
to
use
him
the
vidame
received
letters
from
her
for
the
prince
de
conde
in
which
she
pointed
out
to
the
latter
the
necessity
of
an
alliance
against
the
guises
informed
of
this
intrigue
the
guises
entered
the
queen
s
chamber
for
the
purpose
of
compelling
her
to
issue
an
order
consigning
the
vidame
to
the
bastille
and
catherine
to
save
herself
was
under
the
hard
necessity
of
obeying
them
after
a
captivity
of
some
months
the
vidame
died
on
the
very
day
he
left
prison
which
was
shortly
before
the
conspiracy
of
amboise
such
was
the
conclusion
of
the
first
and
only
amour
of
catherine
de
medici
protestant
historians
have
said
that
the
queen
caused
the
vidame
to
be
poisoned
to
lay
the
secret
of
her
gallantries
in
a
tomb
we
have
now
shown
what
was
the
apprenticeship
of
this
woman
for
the
exercise
of
her
royal
power
part
i
the
calvinist
martyr
i
a
house
which
no
longer
exists
at
the
corner
of
a
street
which
no
longer
exists
in
a
paris
which
no
longer
exists
few
persons
in
the
present
day
know
how
plain
and
unpretentious
were
the
dwellings
of
the
burghers
of
paris
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
how
simple
their
lives
perhaps
this
simplicity
of
habits
and
of
thought
was
the
cause
of
the
grandeur
of
that
old
bourgeoisie
which
was
certainly
grand
free
and
noble
more
so
perhaps
than
the
bourgeoisie
of
the
present
day
its
history
is
still
to
be
written
it
requires
and
it
awaits
a
man
of
genius
this
reflection
will
doubtless
rise
to
the
lips
of
every
one
after
reading
the
almost
unknown
incident
which
forms
the
basis
of
this
study
and
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
facts
in
the
history
of
that
bourgeoisie
it
will
not
be
the
first
time
in
history
that
conclusion
has
preceded
facts
in
the
houses
of
the
rue
de
la
skirted
the
left
bank
of
the
seine
between
the
pont
and
the
pont
au
change
a
public
footpath
and
the
houses
then
occupied
the
space
covered
by
the
present
roadway
each
house
standing
almost
in
the
river
allowed
its
dwellers
to
get
down
to
the
water
by
stone
or
wooden
stairways
closed
and
protected
by
strong
iron
railings
or
wooden
gates
clamped
with
iron
the
houses
like
those
in
venice
had
an
entrance
on
and
a
water
entrance
at
the
moment
when
the
present
sketch
is
published
only
one
of
these
houses
remains
to
recall
the
old
paris
of
which
we
speak
and
that
is
soon
to
disappear
it
stands
at
the
corner
of
the
directly
opposite
to
the
of
the
formerly
each
dwelling
presented
on
the
the
fantastic
appearance
given
either
by
the
trade
of
its
occupant
and
his
habits
or
by
the
originality
of
the
exterior
constructions
invented
by
the
proprietors
to
use
or
abuse
the
seine
the
bridges
being
encumbered
with
more
mills
than
the
necessities
of
navigation
could
allow
the
seine
formed
as
many
enclosed
basins
as
there
were
bridges
some
of
these
basins
in
the
heart
of
old
paris
would
have
offered
precious
scenes
and
tones
of
color
to
painters
what
a
forest
of
crossbeams
supported
the
mills
with
their
huge
sails
and
their
wheels
what
strange
effects
were
produced
by
the
piles
or
props
driven
into
the
water
to
project
the
upper
floors
of
the
houses
above
the
stream
unfortunately
the
art
of
genre
painting
did
not
exist
in
those
days
and
that
of
engraving
was
in
its
infancy
we
have
therefore
lost
that
curious
spectacle
still
offered
though
in
miniature
by
certain
provincial
towns
where
the
rivers
are
overhung
with
wooden
houses
and
where
as
at
vendome
the
basins
full
of
water
grasses
are
enclosed
by
immense
iron
railings
to
isolate
each
proprietor
s
share
of
the
stream
which
extends
from
bank
to
bank
the
name
of
this
street
which
has
now
disappeared
from
the
map
sufficiently
indicates
the
trade
that
was
carried
on
in
it
in
those
days
the
merchants
of
each
class
of
commerce
instead
of
dispersing
themselves
about
the
city
kept
together
in
the
same
neighborhood
and
protected
themselves
mutually
associated
in
corporations
which
limited
their
number
they
were
still
further
united
into
guilds
by
the
church
in
this
way
prices
were
maintained
also
the
masters
were
not
at
the
mercy
of
their
workmen
and
did
not
obey
their
whims
as
they
do
on
the
contrary
they
made
them
their
children
their
apprentices
took
care
of
them
and
taught
them
the
intricacies
of
the
trade
in
order
to
become
a
master
a
workman
had
to
produce
a
masterpiece
which
was
always
dedicated
to
the
saint
of
his
guild
will
any
one
dare
to
say
that
the
absence
of
competition
destroyed
the
desire
for
perfection
or
lessened
the
beauty
of
products
what
say
you
you
whose
admiration
for
the
masterpieces
of
past
ages
has
created
the
modern
trade
of
the
sellers
of
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
the
trade
of
the
furrier
was
one
of
the
most
flourishing
industries
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
furs
which
being
all
brought
from
the
north
required
long
and
perilous
journeys
gave
a
very
high
price
and
value
to
those
products
then
as
now
high
prices
led
to
consumption
for
vanity
likes
to
override
obstacles
in
france
as
in
other
kingdoms
not
only
did
royal
ordinances
restrict
the
use
of
furs
to
the
nobility
proved
by
the
part
which
ermine
plays
in
the
old
blazons
but
also
certain
rare
furs
such
as
which
was
undoubtedly
siberian
sable
could
not
be
worn
by
any
but
kings
dukes
and
certain
lords
clothed
with
official
powers
a
distinction
was
made
between
the
greater
and
lesser
the
very
name
has
been
so
long
disused
that
in
a
vast
number
of
editions
of
perrault
s
famous
tale
cinderella
s
slipper
which
was
no
doubt
of
the
fur
is
said
to
have
been
made
of
glass
lately
one
of
our
most
distinguished
poets
was
obliged
to
establish
the
true
orthography
of
the
word
for
the
instruction
of
his
in
giving
an
account
of
the
opera
of
the
cenerentola
where
the
symbolic
slipper
has
been
replaced
by
a
ring
which
symbolizes
nothing
at
all
naturally
the
sumptuary
laws
about
the
wearing
of
fur
were
perpetually
infringed
upon
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
furriers
the
costliness
of
stuffs
and
furs
made
a
garment
in
those
days
a
durable
thing
as
lasting
as
the
furniture
the
armor
and
other
items
of
that
strong
life
of
the
fifteenth
century
a
woman
of
rank
a
seigneur
all
rich
men
also
all
the
burghers
possessed
at
the
most
two
garments
for
each
season
which
lasted
their
lifetime
and
beyond
it
these
garments
were
bequeathed
to
their
children
consequently
the
clause
in
the
relating
to
arms
and
clothes
which
in
these
days
is
almost
a
dead
letter
because
of
the
small
value
of
wardrobes
that
need
constant
renewing
was
then
of
much
importance
great
costs
brought
with
them
solidity
the
toilet
of
a
woman
constituted
a
large
capital
it
was
reckoned
among
the
family
possessions
and
was
kept
in
those
enormous
chests
which
threaten
to
break
through
the
floors
of
our
modern
houses
the
jewels
of
a
woman
of
would
have
been
the
ornaments
of
a
great
lady
in
the
discovery
of
america
the
facilities
of
transportation
the
ruin
of
social
distinctions
which
has
paved
the
way
for
the
ruin
of
apparent
distinctions
has
reduced
the
trade
of
the
furrier
to
what
it
now
is
next
to
nothing
the
article
which
a
furrier
sells
as
in
former
days
for
twenty
has
followed
the
depreciation
of
money
formerly
the
which
is
now
worth
one
franc
and
is
usually
so
called
was
worth
twenty
francs
the
lesser
bourgeoisie
and
the
courtesans
who
edge
their
capes
with
sable
are
ignorant
than
in
an
would
have
incontinently
arrested
them
and
marched
them
before
the
justice
at
the
chatelet
englishwomen
who
are
so
fond
of
ermine
do
not
know
that
in
former
times
none
but
queens
duchesses
and
chancellors
were
allowed
to
wear
that
royal
fur
there
are
in
france
several
ennobled
families
whose
true
name
is
pelletier
or
lepelletier
the
origin
of
which
is
evidently
derived
from
some
rich
furrier
s
counter
for
most
of
our
burgher
s
names
began
in
some
such
way
this
digression
will
explain
not
only
the
long
feud
as
to
precedence
which
the
guild
of
drapers
maintained
for
two
centuries
against
the
guild
of
furriers
and
also
of
mercers
each
claiming
the
right
to
walk
first
as
being
the
most
important
guild
in
paris
but
it
will
also
serve
to
explain
the
importance
of
the
sieur
lecamus
a
furrier
honored
with
the
custom
of
two
queens
catherine
de
medici
and
mary
stuart
also
the
custom
of
the
parliament
a
man
who
for
twenty
years
was
the
syndic
of
his
corporation
and
who
lived
in
the
street
we
have
just
described
the
house
of
lecamus
was
one
of
three
which
formed
the
three
angles
of
the
open
space
at
the
end
of
the
pont
au
change
where
nothing
now
remains
but
the
tower
of
the
palais
de

which
made
the
fourth
angle
on
the
corner
of
this
house
which
stood
at
the
angle
of
the
pont
au
change
and
the
quai
now
called
the
quai
aux

the
architect
had
constructed
a
little
shrine
for
a

which
was
always
lighted
by
and
decked
with
real
flowers
in
summer
and
artificial
ones
in
winter
on
the
side
of
the
house
toward
the
rue
du
pont
as
on
the
side
toward
the
rue
de
la
the
upper
story
of
the
house
was
supported
by
wooden
pillars
all
the
houses
in
this
mercantile
quarter
had
an
arcade
behind
these
pillars
where
the
passers
in
the
street
walked
under
cover
on
a
ground
of
trodden
mud
which
kept
the
place
always
dirty
in
all
french
towns
these
arcades
or
galleries
are
called
a
general
term
to
which
was
added
the
name
of
the
business
transacted
under
them
as
piliers
des
halles
markets
piliers
de
la
boucherie
butchers
these
galleries
a
necessity
in
the
parisian
climate
which
is
so
changeable
and
so
rainy
gave
this
part
of
the
city
a
peculiar
character
of
its
own
but
they
have
now
disappeared
not
a
single
house
in
the
river
bank
remains
and
not
more
than
about
a
hundred
feet
of
the
old
piliers
des
halles
the
last
that
have
resisted
the
action
of
time
are
left
and
before
long
even
that
relic
of
the
sombre
labyrinth
of
old
paris
will
be
demolished
certainly
the
existence
of
such
old
ruins
of
the
is
incompatible
with
the
grandeurs
of
modern
paris
these
observations
are
meant
not
so
much
to
regret
the
destruction
of
the
old
town
as
to
preserve
in
words
and
by
the
history
of
those
who
lived
there
the
memory
of
a
place
now
turned
to
dust
and
to
excuse
the
following
description
which
may
be
precious
to
a
future
age
now
treading
on
the
heels
of
our
own
the
walls
of
this
house
were
of
wood
covered
with
slate
the
spaces
between
the
uprights
had
been
filled
in
as
we
may
still
see
in
some
provincial
towns
with
brick
so
placed
by
reversing
their
thickness
as
to
make
a
pattern
called
hungarian
the
and
lintels
also
in
wood
were
richly
carved
and
so
was
the
corner
pillar
where
it
rose
above
the
shrine
of
the
madonna
and
all
the
other
pillars
in
front
of
the
house
each
window
and
each
main
beam
which
separated
the
different
storeys
was
covered
with
arabesques
of
fantastic
personages
and
animals
wreathed
with
conventional
foliage
on
the
street
side
as
on
the
river
side
the
house
was
capped
with
a
roof
looking
as
if
two
cards
were
set
up
one
against
the
other
thus
presenting
a
gable
to
the
street
and
a
gable
to
the
water
this
roof
like
the
roof
of
a
swiss
chalet
overhung
the
building
so
far
that
on
the
second
floor
there
was
an
outside
gallery
with
a
balustrade
on
which
the
owners
of
the
house
could
walk
under
cover
and
survey
the
street
also
the
river
basin
between
the
bridges
and
the
two
lines
of
houses
these
houses
on
the
river
bank
were
very
valuable
in
those
days
a
system
of
drains
and
fountains
was
still
to
be
invented
nothing
of
the
kind
as
yet
existed
except
the
circuit
sewer
constructed
by
aubriot
provost
of
paris
under
charles
the
wise
who
also
built
the
bastille
the
pont
and
other
bridges
and
was
the
first
man
of
genius
who
ever
thought
of
the
sanitary
improvement
of
paris
the
houses
situated
like
that
of
lecamus
took
from
the
river
the
water
necessary
for
the
purposes
of
life
and
also
made
the
river
serve
as
a
natural
drain
for
and
household
refuse
the
great
works
that
the
merchants
provosts
did
in
this
direction
are
fast
disappearing
persons
alone
can
remember
to
have
seen
the
great
holes
in
the
rue
montmartre
rue
du
temple
down
which
the
waters
poured
those
terrible
open
jaws
were
in
the
olden
time
of
immense
benefit
to
paris
their
place
will
probably
be
forever
marked
by
the
sudden
rise
of
the
paved
roadways
at
the
spots
where
they
opened
another
archaeological
detail
which
will
be
quite
inexplicable
to
the
historian
two
centuries
hence
one
day
about
a
little
girl
who
was
carrying
a
case
of
diamonds
to
an
actress
at
the
ambigu
for
her
part
as
queen
was
overtaken
by
a
shower
and
so
nearly
washed
down
the
great
drainhole
in
the
rue
du
temple
that
she
would
have
disappeared
had
it
not
been
for
a
passer
who
heard
her
cries
unluckily
she
had
let
go
the
diamonds
which
were
however
recovered
later
at
a
this
event
made
a
great
noise
and
gave
rise
to
many
petitions
against
these
engulfers
of
water
and
little
girls
they
were
singular
constructions
about
five
feet
high
furnished
with
iron
railings
more
or
less
movable
which
often
caused
the
inundation
of
the
neighboring
cellars
whenever
the
artificial
river
produced
by
sudden
rains
was
arrested
in
its
course
by
the
filth
and
refuse
collected
about
these
railings
which
the
owners
of
the
abutting
houses
sometimes
forgot
to
open
the
front
of
this
shop
of
the
sieur
lecamus
was
all
window
formed
of
sashes
of
leaded
panes
which
made
the
interior
very
dark
the
furs
were
taken
for
selection
to
the
houses
of
rich
customers
as
for
those
who
came
to
the
shop
to
buy
the
goods
were
shown
to
them
outside
between
the
pillars
the
arcade
being
let
us
remark
encumbered
during
the
with
tables
and
clerks
sitting
on
stools
such
as
we
all
remember
seeing
some
fifteen
years
ago
under
the
piliers
des
from
these
outposts
the
clerks
and
apprentices
talked
questioned
answered
each
other
and
called
to
the
passers
customs
which
the
great
walter
scott
has
made
use
of
in
his
fortunes
of
the
sign
which
represented
an
ermine
hung
outside
as
we
still
see
in
some
village
hostelries
from
a
rich
bracket
of
gilded
iron
filagree
above
the
ermine
on
one
side
of
the
sign
were
the
words
lecamvs
furrier
to
madame
la
royne
et
du
roy
nostre
sire
on
the
other
side
of
the
sign
were
the
words
to
madame
la
and
messieurs
dv
parlement
the
words
madame
la
had
been
lately
added
the
gilding
was
fresh
this
addition
showed
the
recent
changes
produced
by
the
sudden
and
violent
death
of
henri
which
overturned
many
fortunes
at
court
and
began
that
of
the
guises
the
opened
on
the
river
in
this
room
usually
sat
the
respectable
proprietor
himself
and
mademoiselle
lecamus
in
those
days
the
wife
of
a
man
who
was
not
noble
had
no
right
to
the
title
of
dame
madame
but
the
wives
of
the
burghers
of
paris
were
allowed
to
use
that
of
mademoiselle
in
virtue
of
privileges
granted
and
confirmed
to
their
husbands
by
the
several
kings
to
whom
they
had
done
service
between
this
and
the
main
shop
was
the
well
of
a
which
gave
access
to
the
upper
story
where
were
the
great
and
the
of
the
old
couple
and
the
garrets
lighted
by
skylights
where
slept
the
children
the
the
apprentices
and
the
clerks
this
crowding
of
families
servants
and
apprentices
the
little
space
which
each
took
up
in
the
building
where
the
apprentices
all
slept
in
one
large
chamber
under
the
roof
explains
the
enormous
population
of
paris
then
agglomerated
on
of
the
surface
of
the
present
city
also
the
queer
details
of
private
life
in
the
middle
ages
also
the
contrivances
of
love
which
with
all
due
deference
to
historians
are
found
only
in
the
pages
of
the
without
whom
they
would
be
lost
to
the
world
at
this
period
very
great
such
for
instance
as
admiral
de
coligny
occupied
three
rooms
and
their
suites
lived
at
some
neighboring
inn
there
were
not
in
those
days
more
than
fifty
private
mansions
in
paris
and
those
were
fifty
palaces
belonging
to
sovereign
princes
or
to
great
vassals
whose
way
of
living
was
superior
to
that
of
the
greatest
german
rulers
such
as
the
duke
of
bavaria
and
the
elector
of
saxony
the
kitchen
of
the
lecamus
family
was
beneath
the
and
looked
out
upon
the
river
it
had
a
glass
door
opening
upon
a
sort
of
iron
balcony
from
which
the
cook
drew
up
water
in
a
bucket
and
where
the
household
washing
was
done
the
was
made
the
office
and
salon
of
the
merchant
in
this
important
room
in
all
such
houses
richly
panelled
and
adorned
with
some
special
work
of
art
and
also
a
carved
chest
the
life
of
the
merchant
was
passed
there
the
joyous
suppers
after
the
work
of
the
day
was
over
there
the
secret
conferences
on
the
political
interests
of
the
burghers
and
of
royalty
took
place
the
formidable
corporations
of
paris
were
at
that
time
able
to
arm
a
hundred
thousand
men
therefore
the
opinions
of
the
merchants
were
backed
by
their
servants
their
clerks
their
apprentices
their
workmen
the
burghers
had
a
chief
in
the
provost
of
the
merchants
who
commanded
them
and
in
the
hotel
de
ville
a
palace
where
they
possessed
the
right
to
assemble
in
the
famous
burghers
parlor
their
solemn
deliberations
took
place
had
it
not
been
for
the
continual
sacrifices
which
by
that
time
made
war
intolerable
to
the
corporations
who
were
weary
of
their
losses
and
of
the
famine
henri
that
factionist
who
became
king
might
never
perhaps
have
entered
paris
every
one
can
now
picture
to
himself
the
appearance
of
this
corner
of
old
paris
where
the
bridge
and
quai
still
are
where
the
trees
of
the
quai
aux
fleurs
now
stand
but
where
no
trace
remains
of
the
period
of
which
we
write
except
the
tall
and
famous
tower
of
the
palais
de
justice
from
which
the
signal
was
given
for
the
saint
bartholomew
strange
circumstance
one
of
the
houses
standing
at
the
foot
of
that
tower
then
surrounded
by
wooden
shops
that
namely
of
lecamus
was
about
to
witness
the
birth
of
facts
which
were
destined
to
prepare
for
that
night
of
massacre
which
was
unhappily
more
favorable
than
fatal
to
calvinism
at
the
moment
when
our
history
begins
the
audacity
of
the
new
religious
doctrines
was
putting
all
paris
in
a
ferment
a
scotchman
named
stuart
had
just
assassinated
president
minard
the
member
of
the
parliament
to
whom
public
opinion
attributed
the
largest
share
in
the
execution
of
councillor
anne
du
bourg
who
was
burned
on
the
place
de
greve
after
the
king
s
tailor
to
whom
henri
ii
and
diane
de
poitiers
had
caused
the
torture
of
the
question
to
be
applied
in
their
very
presence
paris
was
so
closely
watched
that
the
archers
compelled
all
passers
along
the
street
to
pray
before
the
shrines
of
the
madonna
so
as
to
discover
heretics
by
their
unwillingness
or
even
refusal
to
do
an
act
contrary
to
their
beliefs
the
two
archers
who
were
stationed
at
the
corner
of
the
lecamus
house
had
departed
and
cristophe
son
of
the
furrier
vehemently
suspected
of
deserting
catholicism
was
able
to
leave
the
shop
without
fear
of
being
made
to
adore
the
virgin
by
seven
in
the
evening
in
april
darkness
was
already
falling
and
the
apprentices
seeing
no
signs
of
customers
on
either
side
of
the
arcade
were
beginning
to
take
in
the
merchandise
exposed
as
samples
beneath
the
pillars
in
order
to
close
the
shop
christophe
lecamus
an
ardent
young
man
about
years
old
was
standing
on
the
sill
of
the
apparently
watching
the
apprentices
monsieur
said
one
of
them
addressing
christophe
and
pointing
to
a
man
who
was
walking
to
and
fro
under
the
gallery
with
an
air
of
indecision
perhaps
that
s
a
thief
or
a
spy
anyhow
the
shabby
wretch
can
t
be
an
honest
man
if
he
wanted
to
speak
to
us
he
would
come
over
frankly
instead
of
sidling
along
as
he
does
and
what
a
face
continued
the
apprentice
mimicking
the
man
with
his
nose
in
his
cloak
his
yellow
eyes
and
that
famished
look
when
the
stranger
thus
described
caught
sight
of
christophe
alone
on
the
he
suddenly
left
the
opposite
gallery
where
he
was
then
walking
crossed
the
street
rapidly
and
came
under
the
arcade
in
front
of
the
lecamus
house
there
he
passed
slowly
along
in
front
of
the
shop
and
before
the
apprentices
returned
to
close
the
outer
shutters
he
said
to
christophe
in
a
low
voice
i
am
hearing
the
name
of
one
of
the
most
illustrious
ministers
and
devoted
actors
in
the
terrible
drama
called
the
reformation
christophe
quivered
as
a
faithful
peasant
might
have
quivered
on
recognizing
his
disguised
king
perhaps
you
would
like
to
see
some
furs
though
it
is
almost
dark
i
will
show
you
some
myself
said
christophe
wishing
to
throw
the
apprentices
whom
he
heard
behind
him
off
the
scent
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
invited
the
minister
to
enter
the
shop
but
the
latter
replied
that
he
preferred
to
converse
outside
christophe
then
fetched
his
cap
and
followed
the
disciple
of
calvin
though
banished
by
an
edict
chaudieu
the
secret
envoy
of
theodore
de
beze
and
calvin
who
were
directing
the
french
reformation
from
geneva
went
and
came
risking
the
cruel
punishment
to
which
the
parliament
in
unison
with
the
church
and
royalty
had
condemned
one
of
their
number
the
celebrated
anne
du
bourg
in
order
to
make
a
terrible
example
chaudieu
whose
brother
was
a
captain
and
one
of
admiral
coligny
s
best
soldiers
was
a
powerful
auxiliary
by
whose
arm
calvin
shook
france
at
the
beginning
of
the
twenty
two
years
of
religious
warfare
now
on
the
point
of
breaking
out
this
minister
was
one
of
the
hidden
wheels
whose
movements
can
best
exhibit
the
action
of
the
reform
chaudieu
led
christophe
to
the
water
s
edge
through
an
underground
passage
which
was
like
that
of
the
marion
tunnel
filled
up
by
the
authorities
about
ten
years
ago
this
passage
which
was
situated
between
the
lecamus
house
and
the
one
adjoining
it
ran
under
the
rue
de
la
and
was
called
the
it
was
used
by
the
dyers
of
the
city
to
go
to
the
river
and
wash
their
flax
and
silks
and
other
stuffs
a
little
boat
was
at
the
entrance
of
it
rowed
by
a
single
sailor
in
the
bow
was
a
man
unknown
to
christophe
a
man
of
low
stature
and
very
simply
dressed
chaudieu
and
christophe
entered
the
boat
which
in
a
moment
was
in
the
middle
of
the
seine
the
sailor
then
directed
its
course
beneath
one
of
the
wooden
arches
of
the
pont
au
change
where
he
tied
up
quickly
to
an
iron
ring
as
yet
no
one
had
said
a
word
here
we
can
speak
without
fear
there
are
no
traitors
or
spies
here
said
chaudieu
looking
at
the
two
as
yet
unnamed
men
then
turning
an
ardent
face
to
christophe
are
you
he
said
full
of
that
devotion
that
should
animate
a
martyr
are
you
ready
to
endure
all
for
our
sacred
cause
do
you
fear
the
tortures
applied
to
the
councillor
du
bourg
to
the
king
s
tailor
tortures
which
await
the
majority
of
us
i
shall
confess
the
gospel
replied
lecamus
simply
looking
at
the
windows
of
his
father
s
the
family
lamp
standing
on
the
table
where
his
father
was
making
up
his
books
for
the
day
spoke
to
him
no
doubt
of
the
joys
of
family
and
the
peaceful
existence
which
he
now
renounced
the
vision
was
rapid
but
complete
his
mind
took
in
at
a
glance
the
burgher
quarter
full
of
its
own
harmonies
where
his
happy
childhood
had
been
spent
where
lived
his
promised
bride
babette
lallier
where
all
things
promised
him
a
sweet
and
full
existence
he
saw
the
past
he
saw
the
future
and
he
sacrificed
it
or
at
any
rate
he
staked
it
all
such
were
the
men
of
that
day
we
need
ask
no
more
said
the
impetuous
sailor
we
know
him
for
one
of
our
if
the
scotchman
had
not
done
the
deed
he
would
kill
us
that
infamous
yes
said
lecamus
my
life
belongs
to
the
church
i
shall
give
it
with
joy
for
the
triumph
of
the
reformation
on
which
i
have
seriously
reflected
i
know
that
what
we
do
is
for
the
happiness
of
the
peoples
in
two
words
popery
drives
to
celibacy
the
reformation
establishes
the
family
it
is
time
to
rid
france
of
her
monks
to
restore
their
lands
to
the
crown
who
will
sooner
or
later
sell
them
to
the
burghers
let
us
learn
to
die
for
our
children
and
make
our
families
some
day
free
and
the
face
of
the
young
enthusiast
that
of
chaudieu
that
of
the
sailor
that
of
the
stranger
seated
in
the
bow
lighted
by
the
last
gleams
of
the
twilight
formed
a
picture
which
ought
the
more
to
be
described
because
the
description
contains
in
itself
the
whole
history
of
the
times
if
it
is
indeed
true
that
to
certain
men
it
is
given
to
sum
up
in
their
own
persons
the
spirit
of
their
age
the
religious
reform
undertaken
by
luther
in
germany
john
knox
in
scotland
calvin
in
france
took
hold
especially
of
those
minds
in
the
lower
classes
into
which
thought
had
penetrated
the
great
lords
sustained
the
movement
only
to
serve
interests
that
were
foreign
to
the
religious
cause
to
these
two
classes
were
added
adventurers
ruined
noblemen
younger
sons
to
whom
all
troubles
were
equally
acceptable
but
among
the
artisan
and
merchant
classes
the
new
faith
was
sincere
and
based
on
calculation
the
masses
of
the
poorer
people
adhered
at
once
to
a
religion
which
gave
the
ecclesiastical
property
to
the
state
and
deprived
the
dignitaries
of
the
church
of
their
enormous
revenues
commerce
everywhere
reckoned
up
the
profits
of
this
religious
operation
and
devoted
itself
body
soul
and
purse
to
the
cause
but
among
the
young
men
of
the
french
bourgeoisie
the
protestant
movement
found
that
noble
inclination
to
sacrifices
of
all
kinds
which
inspires
youth
to
which
selfishness
is
as
yet
unknown
eminent
men
sagacious
minds
discerned
the
republic
in
the
reformation
they
desired
to
establish
throughout
europe
the
government
of
the
united
provinces
which
ended
by
triumphing
over
the
greatest
power
of
those
times
spain
under
philip
the
second
represented
in
the
low
countries
by
the
duke
of
alba
jean
hotoman
was
then
meditating
his
famous
book
in
which
this
project
is
put
forth
a
book
which
spread
throughout
france
the
leaven
of
these
ideas
which
were
stirred
up
anew
by
the
ligue
repressed
by
richelieu
then
by
louis
always
protected
by
the
younger
branches
by
the
house
of
orleans
in
as
by
the
house
of
bourbon
in
whoso
says
investigate
says
all
revolt
is
either
the
cloak
that
hides
a
prince
or
the
of
a
new
mastery
the
house
of
bourbon
the
younger
sons
of
the
valois
were
at
work
beneath
the
surface
of
the
reformation
at
the
moment
when
the
little
boat
floated
beneath
the
arch
of
the
pont
au
change
the
question
was
strangely
complicated
by
the
ambitions
of
the
guises
who
were
rivalling
the
bourbons
thus
the
crown
represented
by
catherine
de
medici
was
able
to
sustain
the
struggle
for
thirty
years
by
pitting
the
one
house
against
the
other
house
whereas
later
the
crown
instead
of
standing
between
various
jealous
ambitions
found
itself
without
a
barrier
face
to
face
with
the
people
richelieu
and
louis
xiv
had
broken
down
the
barrier
of
the
nobility
louis
xv
had
broken
down
that
of
the
parliaments
alone
before
the
people
as
louis
xvi
was
a
king
must
inevitably
succumb
christophe
lecamus
was
a
fine
representative
of
the
ardent
and
devoted
portion
of
the
people
his
wan
face
had
the
sharp
hectic
tones
which
distinguish
certain
fair
complexions
his
hair
was
yellow
of
a
coppery
shade
his
eyes
were
sparkling
in
them
alone
was
his
fine
soul
visible
for
his
face
did
not
atone
for
its
triangular
shape
by
the
noble
mien
of
an
elevated
mind
and
his
low
forehead
indicated
only
extreme
energy
life
seemed
to
centre
in
his
chest
which
was
rather
hollow
more
nervous
than
sanguine
cristophe
s
bodily
appearance
was
thin
and
threadlike
but
wiry
his
pointed
noise
expressed
the
shrewdness
of
the
people
and
his
countenance
revealed
an
intelligence
capable
of
conducting
itself
well
on
a
single
point
of
the
circumference
without
having
the
faculty
of
seeing
all
around
it
his
eyes
the
arching
brows
of
which
scarcely
covered
with
a
whitish
down
projected
like
an
awning
were
strongly
circled
by
a
band
the
skin
being
white
and
shining
at
the
spring
of
the
nose
a
sign
which
almost
always
denotes
excessive
enthusiasm
christophe
was
of
the
people
the
people
who
devote
themselves
who
fight
for
their
devotions
who
let
themselves
be
inveigled
and
betrayed
intelligent
enough
to
comprehend
and
serve
an
idea
too
upright
to
turn
it
to
his
own
account
too
noble
to
sell
himself
contrasting
with
this
son
of
lecamus
chaudieu
the
ardent
minister
with
brown
hair
thinned
by
vigils
a
yellow
skin
an
eloquent
mouth
a
militant
brow
with
flaming
brown
eyes
and
a
short
and
prominent
chin
embodied
well
the
christian
faith
which
brought
to
the
reformation
so
many
sincere
and
fanatical
pastors
whose
courage
and
spirit
aroused
the
populations
the
of
calvin
and
theodore
de
beze
contrasted
admirably
with
the
son
of
the
furrier
he
represented
the
fiery
cause
of
which
the
effect
was
seen
in
christophe
the
sailor
an
impetuous
being
tanned
by
the
open
air
accustomed
to
dewy
nights
and
burning
days
with
closed
lips
hasty
gestures
orange
eyes
ravenous
as
those
of
a
vulture
and
black
frizzled
hair
was
the
embodiment
of
an
adventurer
who
risks
all
in
a
venture
as
a
gambler
stakes
all
on
a
card
his
whole
appearance
revealed
terrific
passions
and
an
audacity
that
flinched
at
nothing
his
vigorous
muscles
were
made
to
be
quiescent
as
well
as
to
act
his
manner
was
more
audacious
than
noble
his
nose
though
thin
turned
up
and
snuffed
battle
he
seemed
agile
and
capable
you
would
have
known
him
in
all
ages
for
the
leader
of
a
party
if
he
were
not
of
the
reformation
he
might
have
been
pizarro
fernando
cortez
or
morgan
the
exterminator
a
man
of
violent
action
of
some
kind
the
fourth
man
sitting
on
a
thwart
wrapped
in
his
cloak
belonged
evidently
to
the
highest
portion
of
society
the
fineness
of
his
linen
its
cut
the
material
and
scent
of
his
clothing
the
style
and
skin
of
his
gloves
showed
him
to
be
a
man
of
courts
just
as
his
bearing
his
haughtiness
his
composure
and
his
glance
proved
him
to
be
a
man
of
war
the
aspect
of
this
personage
made
a
spectator
uneasy
in
the
first
place
and
then
inclined
him
to
respect
we
respect
a
man
who
respects
himself
though
short
and
deformed
his
manners
instantly
redeemed
the
disadvantages
of
his
figure
the
ice
once
broken
he
showed
a
lively
rapidity
of
decision
with
an
indefinable
dash
and
fire
which
made
him
seem
affable
and
winning
he
had
the
blue
eyes
and
the
curved
nose
of
the
house
of
navarre
and
the
spanish
cut
of
the
marked
features
which
were
in
after
days
the
type
of
the
bourbon
kings
in
a
word
the
scene
now
assumed
a
startling
interest
well
said
chaudieu
as
young
lecamus
ended
his
speech
this
boatman
is
la
renaudie
and
here
is
monsiegneur
the
prince
de
conde
he
added
motioning
to
the
deformed
little
man
thus
these
four
men
represented
the
faith
of
the
people
the
spirit
of
the
scriptures
the
mailed
hand
of
the
soldier
and
royalty
itself
hidden
in
that
dark
shadow
of
the
bridge
you
shall
now
know
what
we
expect
of
you
resumed
the
minister
after
allowing
a
short
pause
for
christophe
s
astonishment
in
order
that
you
may
make
no
mistake
we
feel
obliged
to
initiate
you
into
the
most
important
secrets
of
the
the
prince
and
la
renaudie
emphasized
the
minister
s
speech
by
a
gesture
the
latter
having
paused
to
allow
the
prince
to
speak
if
he
so
wished
like
all
great
men
engaged
in
plotting
whose
system
it
is
to
conceal
their
hand
until
the
decisive
moment
the
prince
kept
silence
but
not
from
cowardice
in
these
crises
he
was
always
the
soul
of
the
conspiracy
recoiling
from
no
danger
and
ready
to
risk
his
own
head
but
from
a
sort
of
royal
dignity
he
left
the
explanation
of
the
enterprise
to
his
minister
and
contented
himself
with
studying
the
new
instrument
he
was
about
to
use
my
child
said
chaudieu
in
the
huguenot
style
of
address
we
are
about
to
do
battle
for
the
first
time
with
the
roman
prostitute
in
a
few
days
either
our
legions
will
be
dying
on
the
scaffold
or
the
guises
will
be
dead
this
is
the
first
call
to
arms
on
behalf
of
our
religion
in
france
and
france
will
not
lay
down
those
arms
till
they
have
conquered
the
question
mark
you
this
concerns
the
nation
not
the
kingdom
the
majority
of
the
nobles
of
the
kingdom
see
plainly
what
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
and
his
brother
are
seeking
under
pretext
of
defending
the
catholic
religion
the
house
of
lorraine
means
to
claim
the
crown
of
france
as
its
patrimony
relying
on
the
church
it
has
made
the
church
a
formidable
ally
the
monks
are
its
support
its
acolytes
its
spies
it
has
assumed
the
post
of
guardian
to
the
throne
it
is
seeking
to
usurp
it
protects
the
house
of
valois
which
it
means
to
destroy
we
have
decided
to
take
up
arms
because
the
liberties
of
the
people
and
the
interests
of
the
nobles
are
equally
threatened
let
us
smother
at
its
birth
a
faction
as
odious
as
that
of
the
burgundians
who
formerly
put
paris
and
all
france
to
fire
and
sword
it
required
a
louis
xi
to
put
a
stop
to
the
quarrel
between
the
burgundians
and
the
crown
and
a
prince
de
conde
is
needed
to
prevent
the
house
of
lorraine
from
that
struggle
this
is
not
a
civil
war
it
is
a
duel
between
the
guises
and
the
reformation
a
duel
to
the
death
we
will
make
their
heads
fall
or
they
shall
have
well
said
cried
the
prince
in
this
crisis
christophe
said
la
renaudie
we
mean
to
neglect
nothing
which
shall
strengthen
our
party
for
there
is
a
party
in
the
reformation
the
party
of
thwarted
interests
of
nobles
sacrificed
to
the
lorrains
of
old
captains
shamefully
treated
at
fontainebleau
from
which
the
cardinal
has
banished
them
by
setting
up
gibbets
on
which
to
hang
those
who
ask
the
king
for
the
cost
of
their
equipment
and
their
this
my
child
resumed
chaudieu
observing
a
sort
of
terror
in
christophe
this
it
is
which
compels
us
to
conquer
by
arms
instead
of
conquering
by
conviction
and
by
martyrdom
the
is
on
the
point
of
entering
into
our
views
not
that
she
means
to
abjure
she
has
not
reached
that
decision
as
yet
but
she
may
be
forced
to
it
by
our
triumph
however
that
may
be
queen
catherine
humiliated
and
in
despair
at
seeing
the
power
she
expected
to
wield
on
the
death
of
the
king
passing
into
the
hands
of
the
guises
alarmed
at
the
empire
of
the
young
queen
mary
niece
of
the
lorrains
and
their
auxiliary
queen
catherine
is
doubtless
inclined
to
lend
her
support
to
the
princes
and
lords
who
are
now
about
to
make
an
attempt
which
will
deliver
her
from
the
guises
at
this
moment
devoted
as
she
may
seem
to
them
she
hates
them
she
desires
their
overthrow
and
will
try
to
make
use
of
us
against
them
but
monseigneur
the
prince
de
conde
intends
to
make
use
of
her
against
all
the
will
undoubtedly
consent
to
all
our
plans
we
shall
have
the
connetable
on
our
side
monseigneur
has
just
been
to
see
him
at
chantilly
but
he
does
not
wish
to
move
without
an
order
from
his
masters
being
the
uncle
of
monseigneur
he
will
not
leave
him
in
the
lurch
and
this
generous
prince
does
not
hesitate
to
fling
himself
into
danger
to
force
anne
de
montmorency
to
a
decision
all
is
prepared
and
we
have
cast
our
eyes
on
you
as
the
means
of
communicating
to
queen
catherine
our
treaty
of
alliance
the
drafts
of
edicts
and
the
bases
of
the
new
government
the
court
is
at
blois
many
of
our
friends
are
with
it
but
they
are
to
be
our
future
chiefs
and
like
monseigneur
he
added
motioning
to
the
prince
they
must
not
be
suspected
the
and
our
friends
are
so
closely
watched
that
it
is
impossible
to
employ
as
intermediary
any
known
person
of
importance
they
would
instantly
be
suspected
and
kept
from
communicating
with
madame
catherine
god
sends
us
at
this
crisis
the
shepherd
david
and
his
sling
to
do
battle
with
goliath
of
guise
your
father
unfortunately
for
him
a
good
catholic
is
furrier
to
the
two
queens
he
is
constantly
supplying
them
with
garments
get
him
to
send
you
on
some
errand
to
the
court
you
will
excite
no
suspicion
and
you
can
not
compromise
queen
catherine
in
any
way
all
our
leaders
would
lose
their
heads
if
a
single
imprudent
act
allowed
their
connivance
with
the
to
be
seen
where
a
great
lord
if
discovered
would
give
the
alarm
and
destroy
our
chances
an
insignificant
man
like
you
will
pass
unnoticed
see
the
guises
keep
the
town
so
full
of
spies
that
we
have
only
the
river
where
we
can
talk
without
fear
you
are
now
my
son
like
a
sentinel
who
must
die
at
his
post
remember
this
if
you
are
discovered
we
shall
all
abandon
you
we
shall
even
cast
if
necessary
opprobrium
and
infamy
upon
you
we
shall
say
that
you
are
a
creature
of
the
guises
made
to
play
this
part
to
ruin
us
you
see
therefore
that
we
ask
of
you
a
total
if
you
perish
said
the
prince
de
conde
i
pledge
my
honor
as
a
noble
that
your
family
shall
be
sacred
for
the
house
of
navarre
i
will
bear
it
on
my
heart
and
serve
it
in
all
those
words
my
prince
suffice
replied
christophe
without
reflecting
that
the
conspirator
was
a
gascon
we
live
in
times
when
each
man
prince
or
burgher
must
do
his
there
speaks
the
true
huguenot
if
all
our
men
were
like
that
said
la
renaudie
laying
his
hand
on
christophe
s
shoulder
we
should
be
conquerors
young
man
resumed
the
prince
i
desire
to
show
you
that
if
chaudieu
preaches
if
the
nobleman
goes
armed
the
prince
fights
therefore
in
this
hot
game
all
stakes
are
now
listen
to
me
said
la
renaudie
i
will
not
give
you
the
papers
until
you
reach
beaugency
for
they
must
not
be
risked
during
the
whole
of
your
journey
you
will
find
me
waiting
for
you
there
on
the
wharf
my
face
voice
and
clothes
will
be
so
changed
you
can
not
recognize
me
but
i
shall
say
to
you
are
you
a
and
you
will
answer
ready
to
as
to
the
performance
of
your
mission
these
are
the
means
you
will
find
a
horse
at
the
pinte
fleurie
close
to
l
auxerrois
you
will
there
ask
for
jean
le
breton
who
will
take
you
to
the
stable
and
give
you
one
of
my
ponies
which
is
known
to
do
thirty
leagues
in
eight
hours
leave
by
the
gate
of
bussy
breton
has
a
pass
for
me
use
it
yourself
and
make
your
way
by
skirting
the
towns
you
can
thus
reach
orleans
by
but
the
horse
said
young
lecamus
he
will
not
give
out
till
you
reach
orleans
replied
la
renaudie
leave
him
at
the
entrance
of
the
faubourg
bannier
for
the
gates
are
well
guarded
and
you
must
not
excite
suspicion
it
is
for
you
friend
to
play
your
part
intelligently
you
must
invent
whatever
fable
seems
to
you
best
to
reach
the
third
house
to
the
left
on
entering
orleans
it
belongs
to

three
blows
on
the
door
and

out
on
service
from
messieurs

appear
to

rabid
guisist
no

christophe
touching
his

embraced
his
child
with
singular
religious
effusion
he
was
proud
of
him

thee
he
said
pointing
to
the
ruddy
light
of
the
sinking
sun
which
was
touching
the
old
roofs
covered
with
shingles
and
sending
its
gleams
slantwise
through
the
forest
of
piles
among
which
the
water
was
rippling

christophe

said
the
prince
with
a
gesture
of
infinite
grace
in
which
there
was
something
that
seemed
almost
friendship
with
a
stroke
of
his
oars

put
the

at
the
lower
step
of
the

to

the

disappeared
instantly
beneath

arches
of

the
burghers
christophe
shook
the
iron
railing
which
closed
the
stairway
on
the
river
and
called
his
mother
heard
him
opened
one
of
the
windows
of
the
back
shop
and
asked
what
he
was
doing
there
christophe
answered
that
he
was
cold
and
wanted
to
get
in

my
master
said
the
burgundian
maid
you
went
out
by
the
and
you
return
by

your
father

and
christophe
bewildered
by
a
confidence
which
had
just
brought
him
into
communication
with
the
prince
de
conde
la
renaudie
and
chaudieu
and
still
more
moved
at

prospect
of
impending

war
made
no

he
ran
hastily
up
from
the
kitchen
to
the
back
shop
but
his
mother
a
rabid
catholic
could
not
control
her
anger

the
cautious
old
man
with
white
hair
who
was
turning
over
a
thick
ledger
you
dawdling
fellows
he
went
on
addressing
three
journeymen
who

long
finished
their
suppers
why

i

very
father
i
do
not

right
at

and
in
these
dangerous
times
to
expose
yourself
on
the
i
am
years
old
and
you
ought
to
employ
me
on
such
errands
said
christophe
eyeing
the
box
which
he
supposed
contained
the
surcoat
are
you
glued
to
your
seats
cried
the
old
man
to
his
apprentices
who
at
once
jumped
up
and
seized
their
rapiers
cloaks
and
monsieur
de
thou
s
furs
the
next
day
the
parliament
was
to
receive
in
state
as
its
president
this
illustrious
judge
who
after
signing
the
death
warrant
of
councillor
du
bourg
was
destined
before
the
close
of
the
year
to
sit
in
judgment
on
the
prince
de
conde
here
said
the
old
man
calling
to
the
maid
go
and
ask
friend
lallier
if
he
will
come
and
sup
with
us
and
bring
the
wine
we
ll
furnish
the
victuals
tell
him
above
all
to
bring
his
lecamus
the
syndic
of
the
guild
of
furriers
was
a
handsome
old
man
of
sixty
with
white
hair
and
a
broad
open
brow
as
court
furrier
for
the
last
forty
years
he
had
witnessed
all
the
revolutions
of
the
reign
of
francois
i
he
had
seen
the
arrival
at
the
french
court
of
the
young
girl
catherine
de
medici
then
scarcely
fifteen
years
of
age
he
had
observed
her
giving
way
before
the
duchesse
d
etampes
her
s
mistress
giving
way
before
the
duchesse
de
valentinois
the
mistress
of
her
husband
the
late
king
but
the
furrier
had
brought
himself
safely
through
all
the
chances
and
changes
by
which
court
merchants
were
often
involved
in
the
disgrace
and
overthrow
of
mistresses
his
caution
led
to
his
good
luck
he
maintained
an
attitude
of
extreme
humility
pride
had
never
caught
him
in
its
toils
he
made
himself
so
small
so
gentle
so
compliant
of
so
little
account
at
court
and
before
the
queens
and
princesses
and
favorites
that
this
modesty
combined
with
had
kept
the
royal
sign
above
his
door
such
a
policy
was
of
course
indicative
of
a
shrewd
and
perspicacious
mind
humble
as
lecamus
seemed
to
the
outer
world
he
was
despotic
in
his
own
home
there
he
was
an
autocrat
most
respected
and
honored
by
his
brother
craftsmen
he
owed
to
his
long
possession
of
the
first
place
in
the
trade
much
of
the
consideration
that
was
shown
to
him
he
was
besides
very
willing
to
do
kindnesses
to
others
and
among
the
many
services
he
had
rendered
none
was
more
striking
than
the
assistance
he
had
long
given
to
the
greatest
surgeon
of
the
sixteenth
century
ambroise
pare
who
owed
to
him
the
possibility
of
studying
for
his
profession
in
all
the
difficulties
which
came
up
among
the
merchants
lecamus
was
always
conciliating
thus
a
general
good
opinion
of
him
consolidated
his
position
among
his
equals
while
his
borrowed
characteristics
kept
him
steadily
in
favor
with
the
court
not
only
this
but
having
intrigued
for
the
honor
of
being
on
the
vestry
of
his
parish
church
he
did
what
was
necessary
to
bring
him
into
the
odor
of
sanctity
with
the
rector
of
aux
boeufs
who
looked
upon
him
as
one
of
the
men
most
devoted
to
the
catholic
religion
in
paris
consequently
at
the
time
of
the
convocation
of
the
he
was
unanimously
elected
to
represent
the
through
the
influence
of
the
clergy
of
paris
an
influence
which
at
that
period
was
immense
this
old
man
was
in
short
one
of
those
secretly
ambitious
souls
who
will
bend
for
fifty
years
before
all
the
world
gliding
from
office
to
office
no
one
exactly
knowing
how
it
came
about
that
he
was
found
securely
and
peacefully
seated
at
last
where
no
man
even
the
boldest
would
have
had
the
ambition
at
the
beginning
of
life
to
fancy
himself
so
great
was
the
distance
so
many
the
gulfs
and
the
precipices
to
cross
lecamus
who
had
immense
concealed
wealth
would
not
run
any
risks
and
was
silently
preparing
a
brilliant
future
for
his
son
instead
of
having
the
personal
ambition
which
sacrifices
the
future
to
the
present
he
had
family
ambition
a
lost
sentiment
in
our
time
a
sentiment
suppressed
by
the
folly
of
our
laws
of
inheritance
lecamus
saw
himself
first
president
of
the
parliament
of
paris
in
the
person
of
his
grandson
christophe
godson
of
the
famous
historian
de
thou
was
given
a
most
solid
education
but
it
had
led
him
to
doubt
and
to
the
spirit
of
examination
which
was
then
affecting
both
the
faculties
and
the
students
of
the
universities
christophe
was
at
the
period
of
which
we
are
now
writing
pursuing
his
studies
for
the
bar
that
first
step
toward
the
magistracy
the
old
furrier
was
pretending
to
some
hesitation
as
to
his
son
sometimes
he
seemed
to
wish
to
make
christophe
his
successor
then
again
he
spoke
of
him
as
a
lawyer
but
in
his
heart
he
was
ambitious
of
a
place
for
this
son
as
councillor
of
the
parliament
he
wanted
to
put
the
lecamus
family
on
a
level
with
those
old
and
celebrated
burgher
families
from
which
came
the
pasquiers
the
moles
the
mirons
the
seguiers
lamoignon
du
tillet
lecoigneux
lescalopier
goix
arnauld
those
famous
sheriffs
and
of
the
merchants
among
whom
the
throne
found
such
strong
defenders
therefore
in
order
that
christophe
might
in
due
course
of
time
maintain
his
rank
he
wished
to
marry
him
to
the
daughter
of
the
richest
jeweller
in
the
city
his
friend
lallier
whose
nephew
was
destined
to
present
to
henri
iv
the
keys
of
paris
the
strongest
desire
rooted
in
the
heart
of
the
worthy
burgher
was
to
use
half
of
his
fortune
and
half
of
that
of
the
jeweller
in
the
purchase
of
a
large
and
beautiful
seignorial
estate
which
in
those
days
was
a
long
and
very
difficult
affair
but
his
shrewd
mind
knew
the
age
in
which
he
lived
too
well
to
be
ignorant
of
the
great
movements
which
were
now
in
preparation
he
saw
clearly
and
he
saw
justly
and
knew
that
the
kingdom
was
about
to
be
divided
into
two
camps
the
useless
executions
in
the
place
de
l
estrapade
that
of
the
king
s
tailor
and
the
more
recent
one
of
the
councillor
anne
du
bourg
the
actual
connivance
of
the
great
lords
and
that
of
the
favorite
of
francois
with
the
reformers
were
terrible
indications
the
furrier
resolved
to
remain
whatever
happened
catholic
royalist
and
parliamentarian
but
it
suited
him
privately
that
christophe
should
belong
to
the
reformation
he
knew
he
was
rich
enough
to
ransom
his
son
if
christophe
was
too
much
compromised
and
on
the
other
hand
if
france
became
calvinist
his
son
could
save
the
family
in
the
event
of
one
of
those
furious
parisian
riots
the
memory
of
which
was
with
the
bourgeoisie
riots
they
were
destined
to
see
renewed
through
four
reigns
but
these
thoughts
the
old
furrier
like
louis
did
not
even
say
to
himself
his
wariness
went
so
far
as
to
deceive
his
wife
and
son
this
grave
personage
had
long
been
the
chief
man
of
the
richest
and
most
populous
quarter
of
paris
that
of
the
centre
under
the
title
of
the
title
and
office
which
became
so
celebrated
some
fifteen
months
later
clothed
in
cloth
like
all
the
prudent
burghers
who
obeyed
the
sumptuary
laws
sieur
lecamus
he
was
tenacious
of
that
title
which
charles
granted
to
the
burghers
of
paris
permitting
them
also
to
buy
baronial
estates
and
call
their
wives
by
the
fine
name
of
but
not
by
that
of
madame
wore
neither
gold
chains
nor
silk
but
always
a
good
doublet
with
large
tarnished
silver
buttons
cloth
gaiters
mounting
to
the
knee
and
leather
shoes
with
clasps
his
shirt
of
fine
linen
showed
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
time
in
great
puffs
between
his
jacket
and
his
breeches
though
his
large
and
handsome
face
received
the
full
light
of
the
lamp
standing
on
the
table
christophe
had
no
conception
of
the
thoughts
which
lay
buried
beneath
the
rich
and
florid
dutch
skin
of
the
old
man
but
he
understood
well
enough
the
advantage
he
himself
had
expected
to
obtain
from
his
affection
for
pretty
babette
lallier
so
christophe
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
come
to
a
decision
smiled
bitterly
as
he
heard
of
the
invitation
to
his
promised
bride
when
the
burgundian
cook
and
the
apprentices
had
departed
on
their
several
errands
old
lecamus
looked
at
his
wife
with
a
glance
which
showed
the
firmness
and
resolution
of
his
character
you
will
not
be
satisfied
till
you
have
got
that
boy
hanged
with
your
damned
tongue
he
said
in
a
stern
voice
i
would
rather
see
him
hanged
and
saved
than
living
and
a
huguenot
she
answered
gloomily
to
think
that
a
child
whom
i
carried
nine
months
in
my
womb
should
be
a
bad
catholic
and
be
doomed
to
hell
for
all
eternity
she
began
to
weep
old
silly
said
the
furrier
let
him
live
if
only
to
convert
him
you
said
before
the
apprentices
a
word
which
may
set
fire
to
our
house
and
roast
us
all
like
fleas
in
a
straw
the
mother
crossed
herself
and
sat
down
silently
now
then
you
said
the
old
man
with
a
judicial
glance
at
his
son
explain
to
me
what
you
were
doing
on
the
river
with
come
closer
that
i
may
speak
to
you
he
added
grasping
his
son
by
the
arm
and
drawing
him
to
him
with
the
prince
de
conde
he
whispered
christophe
trembled
do
you
suppose
the
court
furrier
does
not
know
every
face
that
frequents
the
palace
think
you
i
am
ignorant
of
what
is
going
on
monseigneur
the
grand
master
has
been
giving
orders
to
send
troops
to
amboise
withdrawing
troops
from
paris
to
send
them
to
amboise
when
the
king
is
at
blois
and
making
them
march
through
chartres
and
vendome
instead
of
going
by
orleans
isn
t
the
meaning
of
that
clear
enough
there
ll
be
troubles
if
the
queens
want
their
surcoats
they
must
send
for
them
the
prince
de
conde
has
perhaps
made
up
his
mind
to
kill
messieurs
de
guise
who
on
their
side
expect
to
rid
themselves
of
him
the
prince
will
use
the
huguenots
to
protect
himself
why
should
the
son
of
a
furrier
get
himself
into
that
fray
when
you
are
married
and
when
you
are
councillor
to
the
parliament
you
will
be
as
prudent
as
your
father
before
belonging
to
the
new
religion
the
son
of
a
furrier
ought
to
wait
until
the
rest
of
the
world
belongs
to
it
i
don
t
condemn
the
reformers
it
is
not
my
business
to
do
so
but
the
court
is
catholic
the
two
queens
are
catholic
the
parliament
is
catholic
we
must
supply
them
with
furs
and
therefore
we
must
be
catholic
ourselves
you
shall
not
go
out
from
here
christophe
if
you
do
i
will
send
you
to
your
godfather
president
de
thou
who
will
keep
you
night
and
day
blackening
paper
instead
of
blackening
your
soul
in
company
with
those
damned
father
said
christophe
leaning
upon
the
back
of
the
old
man
s
chair
send
me
to
blois
to
carry
that
surcoat
to
queen
mary
and
get
our
money
from
the
if
you
do
not
i
am
lost
and
you
care
for
your
lost
repeated
the
old
man
without
showing
the
least
surprise
if
you
stay
here
you
can
t
be
lost
i
shall
have
my
eye
on
you
all
the
they
will
kill
me
why
the
most
powerful
among
the
huguenots
have
cast
their
eyes
on
me
to
serve
them
in
a
certain
matter
if
i
fail
to
do
what
i
have
just
promised
to
do
they
will
kill
me
in
open
day
here
in
the
street
as
they
killed
minard
but
if
you
send
me
to
court
on
your
affairs
perhaps
i
can
justify
myself
equally
well
to
both
sides
either
i
shall
succeed
without
having
run
any
danger
at
all
and
shall
then
win
a
fine
position
in
the
party
or
if
the
danger
turns
out
very
great
i
shall
be
there
simply
on
your

rose
as
if
his
chair
was
of
iron

said
leave
us
and
watch
that
we
are
left
quite
alone
christophe
and
when
mademoiselle
lecamus
had
left
them
the
furrier
took
his
son
by
a
button
and
led
him
to
the
corner
of
the
room
which
made
the
angle
of
the
bridge

said
whispering
in
his
ear

he
had
done
when
he
mentioned

name
of

prince

a
huguenot
if
you
have
that
vice
but
be
so
cautiously
in
the
depths
of
your
soul
and
not
in
a
way
to
be
pointed
at
as
a
heretic
throughout
the
quarter
what
you
have
just
confessed
to
me
shows
that
the
leaders
have
confidence
in
you
what
are
you
going
to
do
for
them
at
court
i
can
not
tell
you
that
replied
christophe
for
i
do
not
know
hum
hum
muttered
the
old
man
looking
at
his
son
the
scamp
means
to
hoodwink
his
father
he
ll
go
far
you
are
not
going
to
court
he
went
on
in
a
low
tone
to
carry
remittances
to
messieurs
de
guise
or
to
the
little
king
our
master
or
to
the
little
queen
marie
all
those
hearts
are
catholic
but
i
would
take
my
oath
the
italian
woman
has
some
spite
against
the
scotch
girl
and
against
the
lorrains
i
know
her
she
has
a
desperate
desire
to
put
her
hand
into
the
dough
the
late
king
was
so
afraid
of
her
that
he
did
as
the
jewellers
do
he
cut
diamond
by
diamond
he
pitted
one
woman
against
another
that
caused
queen
catherine
s
hatred
to
the
poor
duchesse
de
valentinois
from
whom
she
took
the
beautiful
chateau
of
chenonceaux
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
the
connetable
the
duchess
might
have
been
strangled
back
back
my
son
don
t
put
yourself
in
the
hands
of
that
italian
who
has
no
passion
except
in
her
brain
and
that
s
a
bad
kind
of
woman
yes
what
they
are
sending
you
to
do
at
court
may
give
you
a
very
bad
headache
cried
the
father
seeing
that
christophe
was
about
to
reply
my
son
i
have
plans
for
your
future
which
you
will
not
upset
by
making
yourself
useful
to
queen
catherine
but
heavens
and
earth
don
t
risk
your
head
messieurs
de
guise
would
cut
it
off
as
easily
as
the
burgundian
cuts
a
turnip
and
then
those
persons
who
are
now
employing
you
will
disown
you
i
know
that
father
said
christophe
what
are
you
really
so
strong
my
son
you
know
it
and
are
willing
to
risk
all
yes
by
the
powers
above
us
cried
the
father
pressing
his
son
in
his
arms
we
can
understand
each
other
you
are
worthy
of
your
father
my
child
you
ll
be
the
honor
of
the
family
and
i
see
that
your
old
father
can
speak
plainly
with
you
but
do
not
be
more
huguenot
than
messieurs
de
coligny
never
draw
your
sword
be
a
pen
man
keep
to
your
future
role
of
lawyer
now
then
tell
me
nothing
until
after
you
have
succeeded
if
i
do
not
hear
from
you
by
the
fourth
day
after
you
reach
blois
that
silence
will
tell
me
that
you
are
in
some
danger
the
old
man
will
go
to
save
the
young
one
i
have
not
sold
furs
for
years
without
a
good
knowledge
of
the
wrong
side
of
court
robes
i
have
the
means
of
making
my
way
through
many
christophe
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
as
he
heard
his
father
talking
thus
but
he
thought
there
might
be
some
parental
trap
in
it
and
he
made
no
reply
further
than
to
say
well
make
out
the
bill
and
write
a
letter
to
the
queen
i
must
start
at
once
or
the
greatest
misfortunes
may
start
how
i
shall
buy
a
horse
write
at
once
in
god
s
hey
mother
give
your
son
some
money
cried
the
furrier
to
his
wife
the
mother
returned
went
to
her
chest
took
out
a
purse
of
gold
and
gave
it
to
christophe
who
kissed
her
with
emotion
the
bill
was
all
ready
said
his
father
here
it
is
i
will
write
the
letter
at
christophe
took
the
bill
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
but
you
will
sup
with
us
at
any
rate
said
the
old
man
in
such
a
crisis
you
ought
to
exchange
rings
with
lallier
s
very
well
i
will
go
and
fetch
her
said
christophe
the
young
man
was
distrustful
of
his
father
s
stability
in
the
matter
the
old
man
s
character
was
not
yet
fully
known
to
him
he
ran
up
to
his
room
dressed
himself
took
a
valise
came
downstairs
softly
and
laid
it
on
a
counter
in
the
shop
together
with
his
rapier
and
cloak
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
asked
his
father
hearing
him
christophe
came
up
to
the
old
man
and
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
i
don
t
want
any
one
to
see
my
preparations
for
departure
and
i
have
put
them
on
a
counter
in
the
shop
he
whispered
here
is
the
letter
said
his
father
christophe
took
the
paper
and
went
out
as
if
to
fetch
his
young
neighbor
a
few
moments
after
his
departure
the
goodman
lallier
and
his
daughter
arrived
preceded
by
a
bearing
three
bottles
of
old
wine
well
where
is
christophe
said
old
lecamus
christophe
exclaimed
babette
we
have
not
seen
ha
ha
my
son
is
a
bold
scamp
he
tricks
me
as
if
i
had
no
beard
my
dear
crony
what
think
you
he
will
turn
out
to
be
we
live
in
days
when
the
children
have
more
sense
than
their
why
the
quarter
has
long
been
saying
he
is
in
some
mischief
said
lallier
excuse
him
on
that
point
crony
said
the
furrier
youth
is
foolish
it
runs
after
new
things
but
babette
will
keep
him
quiet
she
is
newer
than
babette
smiled
she
loved
christophe
and
was
angry
when
anything
was
said
against
him
she
was
one
of
those
daughters
of
the
old
bourgeoisie
brought
up
under
the
eyes
of
a
mother
who
never
left
her
her
bearing
was
gentle
and
correct
as
her
face
she
always
wore
woollen
stuffs
of
gray
harmonious
in
tone
her
chemisette
simply
pleated
contrasted
its
whiteness
against
the
gown
her
cap
of
brown
velvet
was
like
an
infant
s
coif
but
it
was
trimmed
with
a
ruche
and
lappets
of
tanned
gauze
that
is
of
a
tan
color
which
came
down
on
each
side
of
her
face
though
fair
and
white
as
a
true
blonde
she
seemed
to
be
shrewd
and
roguish
all
the
while
trying
to
hide
her
roguishness
under
the
air
and
manner
of
a
girl
while
the
two
went
and
came
laying
the
cloth
and
placing
the
jugs
the
great
pewter
dishes
and
the
knives
and
forks
the
jeweller
and
his
daughter
the
furrier
and
his
wife
sat
before
the
tall
draped
with
lambrequins
of
red
serge
and
black
fringes
and
were
talking
of
trifles
babette
asked
once
or
twice
where
christophe
could
be
and
the
father
and
mother
of
the
young
huguenot
gave
evasive
answers
but
when
the
two
families
were
seated
at
table
and
the
two
servants
had
retired
to
the
kitchen
lecamus
said
to
his
future
christophe
has
gone
to
to
blois
such
a
journey
as
that
without
bidding
me
she
said
the
matter
was
pressing
said
the
old
mother
crony
said
the
furrier
resuming
a
suspended
conversation
we
are
going
to
have
troublous
times
in
france
the
reformers
are
bestirring
if
they
triumph
it
will
only
be
after
a
long
war
during
which
business
will
be
at
a
standstill
said
lallier
incapable
of
rising
higher
than
the
commercial
sphere
my
father
who
saw
the
wars
between
the
burgundians
and
the
armagnacs
told
me
that
our
family
would
never
have
come
out
safely
if
one
of
his
grandfathers
his
mother
s
father
had
not
been
a
goix
one
of
those
famous
butchers
in
the
market
who
stood
by
the
burgundians
whereas
the
other
the
lecamus
was
for
the
armagnacs
they
seemed
ready
to
flay
each
other
alive
before
the
world
but
they
were
excellent
friends
in
the
family
so
let
us
both
try
to
save
christophe
perhaps
the
time
may
come
when
he
will
save
you
are
a
shrewd
one
said
the
jeweller
no
replied
lecamus
the
burghers
ought
to
think
of
themselves
the
populace
and
the
nobility
are
both
against
them
the
parisian
bourgeoisie
alarms
everybody
except
the
king
who
knows
it
is
his
you
who
are
so
wise
and
have
seen
so
many
things
said
babette
timidly
explain
to
me
what
the
reformers
really
yes
tell
us
that
crony
cried
the
jeweller
i
knew
the
late
king
s
tailor
and
i
held
him
to
be
a
man
of
simple
life
without
great
talent
he
was
something
like
you
a
man
to
whom
they
d
give
the
sacrament
without
confession
and
behold
he
plunged
to
the
depths
of
this
new
religion
he
a
man
whose
two
ears
were
worth
all
of
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
apiece
he
must
have
had
secrets
to
reveal
to
induce
the
king
and
the
duchesse
de
valentinois
to
be
present
at
his
and
terrible
secrets
too
said
the
furrier
the
reformation
my
friends
he
continued
in
a
low
voice
will
give
back
to
the
bourgeoisie
the
estates
of
the
church
when
the
ecclesiastical
privileges
are
suppressed
the
reformers
intend
to
ask
that
the
shall
be
imposed
on
nobles
as
well
as
on
burghers
and
they
mean
to
insist
that
the
king
alone
shall
be
above
others
if
indeed
they
allow
the
state
to
have
a
suppress
the
throne
ejaculated
lallier
hey
crony
said
lecamus
in
the
low
countries
the
burghers
govern
themselves
with
burgomasters
of
their
own
who
elect
their
own
temporary
god
bless
me
crony
we
ought
to
do
these
fine
things
and
yet
stay
catholics
cried
the
jeweller
we
are
too
old
you
and
i
to
see
the
triumph
of
the
parisian
bourgeoisie
but
it
will
triumph
i
tell
you
in
times
to
come
as
it
did
of
yore
ha
the
king
must
rest
upon
it
in
order
to
resist
and
we
have
always
sold
him
our
help
dear
the
last
time
all
the
burghers
were
ennobled
and
he
gave
them
permission
to
buy
seignorial
estates
and
take
titles
from
the
land
without
special
letters
from
the
king
you
and
i
grandsons
of
the
goix
through
our
mothers
are
not
we
as
good
as
any
lord
these
words
were
so
alarming
to
the
jeweller
and
the
two
women
that
they
were
followed
by
a
dead
silence
the
ferments
of
were
already
tingling
in
the
veins
of
lecamus
who
was
not
yet
so
old
but
what
he
could
live
to
see
the
bold
burghers
of
the
ligue
are
you
selling
well
in
spite
of
these
troubles
said
lallier
to
mademoiselle
lecamus
troubles
always
do
harm
she
replied
that
s
one
reason
why
i
am
so
set
on
making
my
son
a
lawyer
said
lecamus
for
squabbles
and
law
go
on
the
conversation
then
turned
to
commonplace
topics
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
jeweller
who
was
not
fond
of
either
political
troubles
or
audacity
of
thought
iii
the
chateau
de
blois
the
banks
of
the
loire
from
blois
to
angers
were
the
favorite
resort
of
the
last
two
branches
of
the
royal
race
which
occupied
the
throne
before
the
house
of
bourbon
that
beautiful
valley
plain
so
well
deserves
the
honor
bestowed
upon
it
by
kings
that
we
must
here
repeat
what
was
said
of
it
by
one
of
our
most
eloquent
writers
there
is
one
province
in
france
which
is
never
sufficiently
admired
fragrant
as
italy
flowery
as
the
banks
of
the
guadalquivir
beautiful
especially
in
its
own
characteristics
wholly
french
having
always
been
french
unlike
in
that
respect
to
our
northern
provinces
which
have
degenerated
by
contact
with
germany
and
to
our
southern
provinces
which
have
lived
in
concubinage
with
moors
spaniards
and
all
other
nationalities
that
adjoined
them
this
pure
chaste
brave
and
loyal
province
is
touraine
historic
france
is
there
auvergne
is
auvergne
languedoc
is
only
languedoc
but
touraine
is
france
the
most
national
river
for
frenchmen
is
the
loire
which
waters
touraine
for
this
reason
we
ought
not
to
be
surprised
at
the
great
number
of
historically
noble
buildings
possessed
by
those
departments
which
have
taken
the
name
or
derivations
of
the
name
of
the
loire
at
every
step
we
take
in
this
land
of
enchantment
we
discover
a
new
picture
bordered
it
may
be
by
a
river
or
a
tranquil
lake
reflecting
in
its
liquid
depths
a
castle
with
towers
and
woods
and
sparkling
waterfalls
it
is
quite
natural
that
in
a
region
chosen
by
royalty
for
its
sojourn
where
the
court
was
long
established
great
families
and
fortunes
and
distinguished
men
should
have
settled
and
built
palaces
as
grand
as
but
is
it
not
incomprehensible
that
royalty
did
not
follow
the
advice
indirectly
given
by
louis
xi
to
place
the
capital
of
the
kingdom
at
tours
there
without
great
expense
the
loire
might
have
been
made
accessible
for
the
merchant
service
and
also
for
of
light
draught
there
too
the
seat
of
government
would
have
been
safe
from
the
dangers
of
invasion
had
this
been
done
the
northern
cities
would
not
have
required
such
vast
sums
of
money
spent
to
fortify
them
sums
as
vast
as
were
those
expended
on
the
sumptuous
glories
of
versailles
if
louis
xiv
had
listened
to
vauban
who
wished
to
build
his
great
palace
at
mont
louis
between
the
loire
and
the
cher
perhaps
the
revolution
of
might
never
have
taken
place
these
beautiful
shores
still
bear
the
marks
of
royal
tenderness
the
chateaus
of
chambord
amboise
blois
chenonceaux
chaumont
all
those
which
the
mistresses
of
kings
financiers
and
nobles
built
at
veretz
usse
villandri
valencay
chanteloup
duretal
some
of
which
have
disappeared
though
most
of
them
still
remain
are
admirable
relics
which
remind
us
of
the
marvels
of
a
period
that
is
little
understood
by
the
literary
sect
of
the
among
all
these
chateaus
that
of
blois
where
the
court
was
then
staying
is
one
on
which
the
magnificence
of
the
houses
of
orleans
and
of
valois
has
placed
its
brilliant
making
it
the
most
interesting
of
all
for
historians
archaeologists
and
catholics
it
was
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
completely
isolated
the
town
enclosed
by
massive
walls
supported
by
towers
lay
below
the
fortress
for
the
chateau
served
in
fact
as
fort
and
above
the
town
with
its
crowded
roofs
extending
then
as
now
from
the
river
to
the
crest
of
the
hill
which
commands
the
right
bank
lies
a
triangular
plateau
bounded
to
the
west
by
a
streamlet
which
in
these
days
is
of
no
importance
for
it
flows
beneath
the
town
but
in
the
fifteenth
century
so
say
historians
it
formed
quite
a
deep
ravine
of
which
there
still
remains
a
sunken
road
almost
an
abyss
between
the
suburbs
of
the
town
and
the
chateau
it
was
on
this
plateau
with
a
double
exposure
to
the
north
and
south
that
the
counts
of
blois
built
in
the
architecture
of
the
twelfth
century
a
castle
where
the
famous
thibault
de
tircheur
thibault
le
vieux
and
others
held
a
celebrated
court
in
those
days
of
pure
fuedality
in
which
the
king
was
merely
inter
to
use
the
fine
expression
of
a
king
of
poland
the
counts
of
champagne
the
counts
of
blois
those
of
anjou
the
simple
barons
of
normandie
the
dukes
of
bretagne
lived
with
the
splendor
of
sovereign
princes
and
gave
kings
to
the
proudest
kingdoms
the
plantagenets
of
anjou
the
lusignans
of
poitou
the
roberts
of
normandie
maintained
with
a
bold
hand
the
royal
races
and
sometimes
simple
knights
like
du
glaicquin
refused
the
purple
preferring
the
sword
of
a
connetable
when
the
crown
annexed
the
county
of
blois
to
its
domain
louis
who
had
a
liking
for
this
residence
perhaps
to
escape
plessis
of
sinister
memory
built
at
the
back
of
the
first
building
another
building
facing
east
and
west
which
connected
the
chateau
of
the
counts
of
blois
with
the
rest
of
the
old
structures
of
which
nothing
now
remains
but
the
vast
hall
in
which
the
were
held
under
henri
iii
before
he
became
enamoured
of
chambord
francois
wished
to
complete
the
chateau
of
blois
by
adding
two
other
wings
which
would
have
made
the
structure
a
perfect
square
but
chambord
weaned
him
from
blois
where
he
built
only
one
wing
which
in
his
time
and
that
of
his
grandchildren
was
the
only
inhabited
part
of
the
chateau
this
third
building
erected
by
francois
is
more
vast
and
far
more
decorated
than
the
louvre
the
chateau
of
henri
ii
it
is
in
the
style
of
architecture
now
called
renaissance
and
presents
the
most
fantastic
features
of
that
style
therefore
at
a
period
when
a
strict
and
jealous
architecture
ruled
construction
when
the
middle
ages
were
not
even
considered
at
a
time
when
literature
was
not
as
clearly
welded
to
art
as
it
is
now
la
fontaine
said
of
the
chateau
de
blois
in
his
hearty
way
the
part
that
francois
built
if
looked
at
from
the
outside
pleased
me
better
than
all
the
rest
there
i
saw
numbers
of
little
galleries
little
windows
little
balconies
little
ornamentations
without
order
or
regularity
and
they
make
up
a
grand
whole
which
i
the
chateau
of
blois
had
therefore
the
merit
of
representing
three
orders
of
architecture
three
epochs
three
systems
three
dominions
perhaps
there
is
no
other
royal
residence
that
can
compare
with
it
in
that
respect
this
immense
structure
presents
to
the
eye
in
one
enclosure
round
one
courtyard
a
complete
and
perfect
image
of
that
grand
presentation
of
the
manners
and
customs
and
life
of
nations
which
is
called
architecture
at
the
moment
when
christophe
was
to
visit
the
court
that
part
of
the
adjacent
land
which
in
our
day
is
covered
by
a
fourth
palace
built
seventy
years
later
by
gaston
the
rebellious
brother
of
louis
then
exiled
to
blois
was
an
open
space
containing
and
hanging
gardens
picturesquely
placed
among
the
battlements
and
unfinished
turrets
of
francois
s
chateau
these
gardens
communicated
by
a
bridge
of
a
fine
bold
construction
which
the
old
men
of
blois
may
still
remember
to
have
seen
demolished
with
a
on
the
other
side
of
the
chateau
which
by
the
lay
of
the
land
was
on
the
same
level
the
nobles
attached
to
the
court
of
anne
de
bretagne
or
those
of
that
province
who
came
to
solicit
favors
or
to
confer
with
the
queen
as
to
the
fate
and
condition
of
brittany
awaited
in
this
the
opportunity
for
an
audience
either
at
the
queen
s
rising
or
at
her
coming
out
to
walk
consequently
history
has
given
the
name
of
perchoir
aux
bretons
to
this
piece
of
ground
which
in
our
day
is
the
of
a
worthy
bourgeois
and
forms
a
projection
into
the
place
des
jesuites
the
latter
place
was
included
in
the
gardens
of
this
beautiful
royal
residence
which
had
as
we
have
said
its
upper
and
its
lower
gardens
not
far
from
the
place
des
jesuites
may
still
be
seen
a
pavilion
built
by
catherine
de
medici
where
according
to
the
historians
of
blois
warm
mineral
baths
were
placed
for
her
to
use
this
detail
enables
us
to
trace
the
very
irregular
disposition
of
the
gardens
which
went
up
or
down
according
to
the
undulations
of
the
ground
becoming
extremely
intricate
around
the
chateau
a
fact
which
helped
to
give
it
strength
and
caused
as
we
shall
see
the
discomfiture
of
the
duc
de
guise
the
gardens
were
reached
from
the
chateau
through
external
and
internal
galleries
the
most
important
of
which
was
called
the
galerie
des
cerfs
on
account
of
its
decoration
this
gallery
led
to
the
magnificent
staircase
which
no
doubt
inspired
the
famous
double
staircase
of
chambord
it
led
from
floor
to
floor
to
all
the
apartments
of
the
castle
though
la
fontaine
preferred
the
chateau
of
francois
to
that
of
louis
perhaps
the
naivete
of
that
of
the
good
king
will
give
true
artists
more
pleasure
while
at
the
same
time
they
admire
the
magnificent
structure
of
the
knightly
king
the
elegance
of
the
two
staircases
which
are
placed
at
each
end
of
the
chateau
of
louis
the
delicate
carving
and
sculpture
so
original
in
design
which
abound
everywhere
the
remains
of
which
though
time
has
done
its
worst
still
charm
the
antiquary
all
even
to
the
distribution
of
the
apartments
reveals
a
great
simplicity
of
manners
evidently
the
did
not
yet
exist
it
had
not
developed
as
it
did
under
francois
and
catherine
de
medici
to
the
great
detriment
of
feudal
customs
as
we
admire
the
galleries
or
most
of
them
the
capitals
of
the
columns
and
certain
figurines
of
exquisite
delicacy
it
is
impossible
not
to
imagine
that
michel
columb
that
great
sculptor
the
of
brittany
passed
that
way
for
the
pleasure
of
queen
anne
whom
he
afterwards
immortalized
on
the
tomb
of
her
father
the
last
duke
of
brittany
whatever
la
fontaine
may
choose
to
say
about
the
little
galleries
and
the
little
ornamentations
nothing
can
be
more
grandiose
than
the
dwelling
of
the
splendid
francois
thanks
to
i
know
not
what
indifference
to
forgetfulness
perhaps
the
apartments
occupied
by
catherine
de
medici
and
her
son
francois
ii
present
to
us
the
leading
features
of
that
time
the
historian
can
there
restore
the
tragic
scenes
of
the
drama
of
the
reformation
a
drama
in
which
the
dual
struggle
of
the
guises
and
of
the
bourbons
against
the
valois
was
a
series
of
most
complicated
acts
the
plot
of
which
was
here
unravelled
the
chateau
of
francois
completely
crushes
the
artless
habitation
of
louis
xii
by
its
imposing
masses
on
the
side
of
the
gardens
that
is
toward
the
modern
place
des
jesuites
the
castle
presents
an
elevation
nearly
double
that
which
it
shows
on
the
side
of
the
courtyard
the
on
this
side
forms
the
second
floor
on
the
side
of
the
gardens
where
are
placed
the
celebrated
galleries
thus
the
first
floor
above
the
toward
the
courtyard
where
queen
catherine
was
lodged
is
the
third
floor
on
the
garden
side
and
the
king
s
apartments
were
four
storeys
above
the
garden
which
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
was
separated
from
the
base
of
the
castle
by
a
deep
moat
the
chateau
already
colossal
as
viewed
from
the
courtyard
appears
gigantic
when
seen
from
below
as
la
fontaine
saw
it
he
mentions
particularly
that
he
did
not
enter
either
the
courtyard
or
the
apartments
and
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
from
the
place
des
jesuites
all
the
details
seem
small
the
balconies
on
which
the
courtiers
promenaded
the
galleries
marvellously
executed
the
sculptured
windows
whose
embrasures
are
so
deep
as
to
form
boudoirs
for
which
indeed
they
served
resemble
at
that
great
height
the
fantastic
decorations
which
give
to
a
fairy
palace
at
the
opera
but
in
the
courtyard
although
the
three
storeys
above
the
rise
as
high
as
the
of
the
tuileries
the
infinite
delicacy
of
the
architecture
reveals
itself
to
the
rapture
of
our
astonished
eyes
this
wing
of
the
great
building
in
which
the
two
queens
catherine
de
medici
and
mary
stuart
held
their
sumptuous
court
is
divided
in
the
centre
by
a
hexagon
tower
in
the
empty
well
of
which
winds
up
a
spiral
staircase
a
moorish
caprice
designed
by
giants
made
by
dwarfs
which
gives
to
this
wonderful
facade
the
effect
of
a
dream
the
baluster
of
this
staircase
forms
a
spiral
connecting
itself
by
a
square
landing
to
five
of
the
six
sides
of
the
tower
requiring
at
each
landing
transversal
corbels
which
are
decorated
with
arabesque
carvings
without
and
within
this
bewildering
creation
of
ingenious
and
delicate
details
of
marvels
which
give
speech
to
stones
can
be
compared
only
to
the
deeply
worked
and
crowded
carving
of
the
chinese
ivories
stone
is
made
to
look
like
the
flowers
the
figures
of
men
and
animals
clinging
to
the
structure
of
the
stairway
are
multiplied
step
by
step
until
they
crown
the
tower
with
a
on
which
the
chisels
of
the
art
of
the
sixteenth
century
have
contended
against
the
naive
cutters
of
images
who
fifty
years
earlier
had
carved
the
of
louis
s
two
stairways
however
dazzled
we
may
be
by
these
recurring
forms
of
indefatigable
labor
we
can
not
fail
to
see
that
money
was
lacking
to
francois
for
blois
as
it
was
to
louis
xiv
for
versailles
more
than
one
figurine
lifts
its
delicate
head
from
a
block
of
rough
stone
behind
it
more
than
one
fantastic
flower
is
merely
indicated
by
chiselled
touches
on
the
abandoned
stone
though
dampness
has
since
laid
its
blossoms
of
mouldy
greenery
upon
it
on
the
facade
side
by
side
with
the
tracery
of
one
window
another
window
presents
its
masses
of
jagged
stone
carved
only
by
the
hand
of
time
here
to
the
least
artistic
and
the
least
trained
eye
is
a
ravishing
contrast
between
this
frontage
where
marvels
throng
and
the
interior
frontage
of
the
chateau
of
louis
which
is
composed
of
a
of
arcades
of
fairy
lightness
supported
by
tiny
columns
resting
at
their
base
on
a
graceful
platform
and
of
two
storeys
above
it
the
windows
of
which
are
carved
with
delightful
sobriety
beneath
the
arcade
is
a
gallery
the
walls
of
which
are
painted
in
fresco
the
ceiling
also
being
painted
traces
can
still
be
found
of
this
magnificence
derived
from
italy
and
testifying
to
the
expeditions
of
our
kings
to
which
the
principality
of
milan
then
belonged
opposite
to
francois
s
wing
was
the
chapel
of
the
counts
of
blois
the
facade
of
which
is
almost
in
harmony
with
the
architecture
of
the
later
dwelling
of
louis
xii
no
words
can
picture
the
majestic
solidity
of
these
three
distinct
masses
of
building
in
spite
of
their
nonconformity
of
style
royalty
powerful
and
firm
demonstrating
its
dangers
by
the
greatness
of
its
precautions
was
a
bond
uniting
these
three
edifices
so
different
in
character
two
of
which
rested
against
the
vast
hall
of
the
towering
high
like
a
church
certainly
neither
the
simplicity
nor
the
strength
of
the
burgher
existence
which
were
depicted
at
the
beginning
of
this
history
in
which
art
was
always
represented
were
lacking
to
this
royal
habitation
blois
was
the
fruitful
and
brilliant
example
to
which
the
bourgeoisie
and
feudality
wealth
and
nobility
gave
such
splendid
replies
in
the
towns
and
in
the
rural
regions
imagination
could
not
desire
any
other
sort
of
dwelling
for
the
prince
who
reigned
over
france
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
richness
of
seignorial
garments
the
luxury
of
female
adornment
must
have
harmonized
delightfully
with
the
of
these
stones
so
wonderfully
manipulated
from
floor
to
floor
as
the
king
of
france
went
up
the
marvellous
staircase
of
his
chateau
of
blois
he
could
see
the
broad
expanse
of
the
beautiful
loire
which
brought
him
news
of
all
his
kingdom
as
it
lay
on
either
side
of
the
great
river
two
halves
of
a
state
facing
each
other
and
if
instead
of
building
chambord
in
a
barren
gloomy
plain
two
leagues
away
francois
had
placed
it
where
seventy
years
later
gaston
built
his
palace
versailles
would
never
have
existed
and
blois
would
have
become
necessarily
the
capital
of
france
four
valois
and
catherine
de
medici
lavished
their
wealth
on
the
wing
built
by
francois
at
blois
who
can
look
at
those
massive
the
spinal
column
of
the
castle
in
which
are
sunken
deep
alcoves
secret
staircases
cabinets
while
they
themselves
enclose
halls
as
vast
as
that
great
the
guardroom
and
the
royal
chambers
in
which
in
our
day
a
regiment
of
infantry
is
comfortably
lodged
who
can
look
at
all
this
and
not
be
aware
of
the
prodigalities
of
crown
and
court
even
if
a
visitor
does
not
at
once
understand
how
the
splendor
within
must
have
corresponded
with
the
splendor
without
the
remaining
vestiges
of
catherine
de
medici
s
cabinet
where
christophe
was
about
to
be
introduced
would
bear
sufficient
testimony
to
the
elegances
of
art
which
peopled
these
apartments
with
animated
designs
in
which
salamanders
sparkled
among
the
wreaths
and
the
palette
of
the
sixteenth
century
illumined
the
darkest
corners
with
its
brilliant
coloring
in
this
cabinet
an
observer
will
still
find
traces
of
that
taste
for
gilding
which
catherine
brought
with
her
from
italy
for
the
princesses
of
her
house
loved
in
the
words
of
the
author
already
quoted
to
veneer
the
castles
of
france
with
the
gold
earned
by
their
ancestors
in
commerce
and
to
hang
out
their
wealth
on
the
walls
of
their
apartments
the
occupied
on
the
first
upper
floor
of
the
apartments
of
queen
claude
of
france
wife
of
francois
in
which
may
still
be
seen
delicately
carved
the
double
c
accompanied
by
figures
purely
white
of
swans
and
lilies
signifying
more
white
than
the
whitest
the
motto
of
the
queen
whose
name
began
like
that
of
catherine
with
a
c
and
which
applied
as
well
to
the
daughter
of
louis
xii
as
to
the
mother
of
the
last
valois
for
no
suspicion
in
spite
of
the
violence
of
calvinist
calumny
has
tarnished
the
fidelity
of
catherine
de
medici
to
henri
ii
the
still
charged
with
the
care
of
two
young
children
him
who
was
afterward
duc

the

the
queen
mary

occupied
on
the
second
floor
the
royal
apartments
which
had
formerly
been
those
of

and
were
subsequently
those
of
henri
iii
this
floor
like
that
taken

divided
in
two
parts
throughout
its
whole
length
by
the
famous
which
is
more
than
four
feet
thick
against
which
rests
the
enormous
walls
which
separate
the
rooms
from
each
other
thus
on
both
floors
the
apartments
are
in
two
distinct
halves
one
half
to
the
south
looking
to
the
courtyard
served
for
public
receptions
and
for
the
transaction
of
business
whereas
the
private
apartments
were
placed
partly
to
escape
the
heat
to
the
north
overlooking
the
gardens
on
which
side
is
the
splendid
facade
with
its
balconies
and
galleries
looking
out
upon
the
open
country
of
the
vendomois
and
down
upon
the
perchoir
des
bretons
and
the
moat
the
only
side
of
which
la
fontaine
speaks
the
chateau
of
francois
was
in
those
days
terminated
by
an
enormous
unfinished
tower
which
was
intended
to
mark
the
colossal
angle
of
the
building
when
the
succeeding
wing
was
built
later
gaston
took
down
one
side
of
it
in
order
to
build
his
palace
on
to
it
but
he
never
finished
the
work
and
the
tower
remained
in
ruins
this
royal
stronghold
served
as
a
prison
or
dungeon
according
to
popular
tradition
as
we
wander
through
the
halls
of
this
matchless
chateau
so
precious
to
art
and
to
history
what
poet
would
not
be
haunted
by
regrets
and
grieved
for
france
at
seeing
the
arabesques
of
catherine
s
boudoir
and
almost
obliterated
by
order
of
the
quartermaster
of
the
barracks
this
royal
residence
is
now
a
barrack
at
the
time
of
an
outbreak
of
cholera
the
panels
of
catherine
s
boudoir
a
room
of
which
we
are
about
to
speak
is
the
last
remaining
relic
of
the
rich
decorations
accumulated
by
five
artistic
kings
making
our
way
through
the
labyrinth
of
chambers
halls
stairways
towers
we
may
say
to
ourselves
with
solemn
certitude
here
mary
stuart
cajoled
her
husband
on
behalf
of
the

the
guises
insulted
later
at
that
very
spot
the

fell
beneath
the
daggers
of
the
avengers

took
place
the
sole
remaining
fragment
of

it

this
wonderful
structure
in

so
many
styles
may
still
be
seen
so
many
great
deeds
have
been
performed
is
in
a
state
of
dilapidation

disgraces

what
grief
for
those
who
love
the
great
historic
monuments
of
our
country
to
know
that
soon
those
eloquent
stones
will
be
lost
to
sight
and
knowledge
like
others
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
possibly
they
will
exist
nowhere
but
in
these
pages
it
is
necessary
to
remark
that
in
order
to
watch
the
royal
court
more
closely
the
guises
although
they
had
a
house
of
their
own
in
the
town
which
still
exists
had
obtained
permission
to
occupy
the
upper
floor
above
the
apartments
of
louis
the
same
lodgings
afterwards
occupied
by
the
duchesse
de
nemours
under
the
roof
the
young
king
francois
and
his
bride
mary
stuart
in
love
with
each
other
like
the
girl
and
boy
of
sixteen
which
they
were
had
been
abruptly
transferred
in
the
depth
of
winter
from
the
chateau
de
which
the
duc
de
guise
thought
liable
to
attack
to
the
fortress
which
the
chateau
of
blois
then
was
being
isolated
and
protected
on
three
sides
by
precipices
and
admirably
defended
as
to
its
entrance
the
guises
uncles
of
mary
stuart
had
powerful
reasons
for
not
residing
in
paris
and
for
keeping
the
king
and
court
in
a
castle
the
whole
exterior
surroundings
of
which
could
easily
be
watched
and
defended
a
struggle
was
now
beginning
around
the
throne
between
the
house
of
lorraine
and
the
house
of
valois
which
was
destined
to
end
in
this
very
chateau
years
later
namely
in
when
henri
under
the
very
eyes
of
his
mother
at
that
moment
deeply
humiliated
by
the
lorrains
heard
fall
upon
the
floor
of
his
own
cabinet
the
head
of
the
boldest
of
all
the
guises
the
second
balafre
son
of
that
first
balafre
by
whom
catherine
de
medici
was
now
being
tricked
watched
threatened
and
virtually
imprisoned
iv
the
this
noble
chateau
of
blois
was
to
catherine
de
medici
the
narrowest
of
prisons
on
the
death
of
her
husband
who
had
always
held
her
in
subjection
she
expected
to
reign
but
on
the
contrary
she
found
herself
crushed
under
the
thraldom
of
strangers
whose
polished
manners
were
really
far
more
brutal
than
those
of
jailers
no
action
of
hers
could
be
done
secretly
the
women
who
attended
her
either
had
lovers
among
the
guises
or
were
watched
by
argus
eyes
these
were
times
when
passions
notably
exhibited
the
strange
effects
produced
in
all
ages
by
the
strong
antagonism
of
two
powerful
conflicting
interests
in
the
state
gallantry
which
served
catherine
so
well
was
also
an
auxiliary
of
the
guises
the
prince
de
conde
the
first
leader
of
the
reformation
was
a
lover
of
the
marechale
de
whose
husband
was
the
tool
of
the
grand
master
the
cardinal
convinced
by
the
affair
of
the
vidame
de
chartres
that
catherine
was
more
unconquered
than
invulnerable
as
to
love
was
paying
court
to
her
the
play
of
all
these
passions
strangely
complicated
those
of
politics
making
as
it
were
a
double
game
of
chess
in
which
both
parties
had
to
watch
the
head
and
heart
of
their
opponent
in
order
to
know
when
a
crisis
came
whether
the
one
would
betray
the
other
though
she
was
constantly
in
presence
of
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
or
of
duc
francois
de
guise
who
both
distrusted
her
the
closest
and
ablest
enemy
of
catherine
de
medici
was
her
queen
mary
a
fair
little
creature
malicious
as
a
proud
as
a
stuart
wearing
three
crowns
learned
as
an
old
pedant
giddy
as
a
as
much
in
love
with
her
husband
as
a
courtesan
is
with
her
lover
devoted
to
her
uncles
whom
she
admired
and
delighted
to
see
the
king
share
at
her
instigation
the
regard
she
had
for
them
a
is
always
a
person
whom
the
is
inclined
not
to
like
especially
when
she
wears
the
crown
and
wishes
to
retain
it
which
catherine
had
imprudently
made
but
too
well
known
her
former
position
when
diane
de
poitiers
had
ruled
henri
was
more
tolerable
than
this
then
at
least
she
received
the
external
honors
that
were
due
to
a
queen
and
the
homage
of
the
court
but
now
the
duke
and
the
cardinal
who
had
none
but
their
own
minions
about
them
seemed
to
take
pleasure
in
abasing
her
catherine
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
by
their
courtiers
received
not
only
day
by
day
but
from
hour
to
hour
terrible
blows
to
her
pride
and
her
for
the
guises
were
determined
to
treat
her
on
the
same
system
of
repression
which
the
late
king
her
husband
had
so
long
pursued
the
years
of
anguish
which
were
now
about
to
desolate
france
may
perhaps
be
said
to
have
begun
by
the
scene
in
which
the
son
of
the
furrier
of
the
two
queens
was
sent
on
the
perilous
errand
which
makes
him
the
chief
figure
of
our
present
study
the
danger
into
which
this
zealous
reformer
was
about
to
fall
became
imminent
the
very
morning
on
which
he
started
from
the
port
of
beaugency
for
the
chateau
de
blois
bearing
precious
documents
which
compromised
the
highest
heads
of
the
nobility
placed
in
his
hands
by
that
wily
partisan
the
indefatigable
la
renaudie
who
met
him
as
agreed
upon
at
beaugency
having
reached
that
port
before
him
while
the
in
which
christophe
now
embarked
floated
impelled
by
a
light
east
wind
down
the
river
loire
the
famous
cardinal
de
lorraine
and
his
brother
the
second
duc
de
guise
one
of
the
greatest
warriors
of
those
days
were
contemplating
like
eagles
perched
on
a
rocky
summit
their
present
situation
and
looking
prudently
about
them
before
striking
the
great
blow
by
which
they
intended
to
kill
the
reform
in
france
at
amboise
an
attempt
renewed
twelve
years
later
in
paris
august
on
the
feast
of
during
the
night
three
who
each
played
a
great
part
in
the
twelve
years
drama
which
followed
this
double
plot
now
laid
by
the
guises
and
also
by
the
reformers
had
arrived
at
blois
from
different
directions
each
riding
at
full
speed
and
leaving
their
horses
at
the
of
the
chateau
which
was
guarded
by
captains
and
soldiers
absolutely
devoted
to
the
duc
de
guise
the
idol
of
all
warriors
one
word
about
that
great
man
a
word
that
must
tell
in
the
first
instance
whence
his
fortunes
took
their
rise
his
mother
was
antoinette
de
bourbon
of
henri
iv
of
what
avail
is
consanguinity
he
was
at
this
moment
aiming
at
the
head
of
his
cousin
the
prince
de
conde
his
niece
was
mary
stuart
his
wife
was
anne
daughter
of
the
duke
of
ferrara
the
grand
connetable
de
montmorency
called
the
duc
de
guise
monseigneur
as
he
would
the
king
ending
his
letter
with
your
very
humble
guise
grand
master
of
the
king
s
household
replied
monsieur
le
connetable
and
signed
as
he
did
for
the
parliament
your
very
good
as
for
the
cardinal
called
the
transalpine
pope
and
his
holiness
by
estienne
he
had
the
whole
monastic
church
of
france
on
his
side
and
treated
the
holy
father
as
an
equal
vain
of
his
eloquence
and
one
of
the
greatest
theologians
of
his
time
he
kept
incessant
watch
over
france
and
italy
by
means
of
three
religious
orders
who
were
absolutely
devoted
to
him
toiling
day
and
night
in
his
service
and
serving
him
as
spies
and
counsellors
these
few
words
will
explain
to
what
heights
of
power
the
duke
and
the
cardinal
had
attained
in
spite
of
their
wealth
and
the
enormous
revenues
of
their
several
offices
they
were
so
personally
disinterested
so
eagerly
carried
away
on
the
current
of
their
statesmanship
and
so
generous
at
heart
that
they
were
always
in
debt
doubtless
after
the
manner
of
caesar
when
henri
iii
caused
the
death
of
the
second
balafre
whose
life
was
a
menace
to
him
the
house
of
guise
was
necessarily
ruined
the
costs
of
endeavoring
to
seize
the
crown
during
a
whole
century
will
explain
the
lowered
position
of
this
great
house
during
the
reigns
of
louis
xiii
and
louis
when
the
sudden
death
of
madame
told
all
europe
the
infamous
part
which
a
chevalier
de
lorraine
had
debased
himself
to
play
calling
themselves
the
heirs
of
the
dispossessed
carolovingians
the
duke
and
cardinal
acted
with
the
utmost
insolence
towards
catherine
de
medici
the
of
their
niece
the
duchesse
de
guise
spared
her
no
mortification
this
duchesse
was
a
d
este
and
catherine
was
a
medici
the
daughter
of
upstart
florentine
merchants
whom
the
sovereigns
of
europe
had
never
yet
admitted
into
their
royal
fraternity
francois
himself
has
always
considered
his
son
s
marriage
with
a
medici
as
a
mesalliance
and
only
consented
to
it
under
the
expectation
that
his
second
son
would
never
be
dauphin
hence
his
fury
when
his
eldest
son
was
poisoned
by
the
florentine
montecuculi
the
d
estes
refused
to
recognize
the
medici
as
italian
princes
those
former
merchants
were
in
fact
trying
to
solve
the
impossible
problem
of
maintaining
a
throne
in
the
midst
of
republican
institutions
the
title
of
was
only
granted
very
tardily
by
philip
the
second
king
of
spain
to
reward
those
medici
who
bought
it
by
betraying
france
their
benefactress
and
servilely
attaching
themselves
to
the
court
of
spain
which
was
at
the
very
time
covertly
counteracting
them
in
italy
flatter
none
but
your
enemies
the
famous
saying
of
catherine
de
medici
seems
to
have
been
the
political
rule
of
life
with
that
family
of
merchant
princes
in
which
great
men
were
never
lacking
until
their
destinies
became
great
when
they
fell
before
their
time
into
that
degeneracy
in
which
royal
races
and
noble
families
are
wont
to
end
for
three
generations
there
had
been
a
great
lorrain
warrior
and
a
great
lorrain
churchman
and
what
is
more
singular
the
churchmen
all
bore
a
strong
resemblance
in
the
face
to
ximenes
as
did
cardinal
richelieu
in
after
days
these
five
great
cardinals
all
had
sly
mean
and
yet
terrible
faces
while
the
warriors
on
the
other
hand
were
of
that
type
of
basque
mountaineer
which
we
see
in
henri
iv
the
two
balafres
father
and
son
wounded
and
scarred
in
the
same
manner
lost
something
of
this
type
but
not
the
grace
and
affability
by
which
as
much
as
by
their
bravery
they
won
the
hearts
of
the
soldiery
it
is
not
useless
to
relate
how
the
present
grand
master
received
his
wound
for
it
was
healed
by
the
heroic
measures
of
a
personage
of
our
drama
by
ambroise
pare
the
man
we
have
already
mentioned
as
under
obligations
to
lecamus
syndic
of
the
guild
of
furriers
at
the
siege
of
calais
the
duke
had
his
face
pierced
through
and
through
by
a
lance
the
point
of
which
after
entering
the
cheek
just
below
the
right
eye
went
through
to
the
neck
below
the
left
eye
and
remained
broken
off
in
the
face
the
duke
lay
dying
in
his
tent
in
the
midst
of
universal
distress
and
he
would
have
died
had
it
not
been
for
the
devotion
and
prompt
courage
of
ambroise
pare
the
duke
is
not
dead
gentlemen
he
said
to
the
weeping
attendants
but
he
soon
will
die
if
i
dare
not
treat
him
as
i
would
a
dead
man
and
i
shall
risk
doing
so
no
matter
what
it
may
cost
me
in
the
end
see
and
with
that
he
put
his
left
foot
on
the
duke
s
breast
took
the
broken
wooden
end
of
the
lance
in
his
fingers
shook
and
loosened
it
by
degrees
in
the
wound
and
finally
succeeded
in
drawing
out
the
iron
head
as
if
he
were
handling
a
thing
and
not
a
man
though
he
saved
the
prince
by
this
heroic
treatment
he
could
not
prevent
the
horrible
scar
which
gave
the
great
soldier
his
nickname
le
balafre
the
scarred
this
name
descended
to
the
son
and
for
a
similar
reason
absolutely
masters
of
francois
whom
his
wife
ruled
through
their
mutual
and
excessive
passion
these
two
great
lorrain
princes
the
duke
and
the
cardinal
were
masters
of
france
and
had
no
other
enemy
at
court
than
catherine
de
medici
no
great
statesmen
ever
played
a
closer
or
more
watchful
game
the
mutual
position
of
the
ambitious
widow
of
henri
ii
and
the
ambitious
house
of
lorraine
was
pictured
as
it
were
to
the
eye
by
a
scene
which
took
place
on
the
terrace
of
the
chateau
de
blois
very
early
in
the
morning
of
the
day
on
which
christophe
lecamus
was
destined
to
arrive
there
the
who
feigned
an
extreme
attachment
to
the
guises
had
asked
to
be
informed
of
the
news
brought
by
the
three
coming
from
three
different
parts
of
the
kingdom
but
she
had
the
mortification
of
being
courteously
dismissed
by
the
cardinal
she
then
walked
to
the
parterres
which
overhung
the
loire
where
she
was
building
under
the
superintendence
of
her
astrologer
ruggieri
an
observatory
which
is
still
standing
and
from
which
the
eye
may
range
over
the
whole
landscape
of
that
delightful
valley
the
two
lorrain
princes
were
at
the
other
end
of
the
terrace
facing
the
vendomois
which
overlooks
the
upper
part
of
the
town
the
perch
of
the
bretons
and
the
postern
gate
of
the
chateau
catherine
had
deceived
the
two
brothers
by
pretending
to
a
slight
displeasure
for
she
was
in
reality
very
well
pleased
to
have
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
one
of
the
three
young
men
who
had
arrived
in
such
haste
this
was
a
young
nobleman
named
chiverni
apparently
a
tool
of
the
cardinal
in
reality
a
devoted
servant
of
catherine
catherine
also
counted
among
her
devoted
servants
two
florentine
nobles
the
gondi
but
they
were
so
suspected
by
the
guises
that
she
dared
not
send
them
on
any
errand
away
from
the
court
where
she
kept
them
watched
it
is
true
in
all
their
words
and
actions
but
where
at
least
they
were
able
to
watch
and
study
the
guises
and
counsel
catherine
these
two
florentines
maintained
in
the
interests
of
the
another
italian
birago
a
clever
piedmontese
who
pretended
with
chiverni
to
have
abandoned
their
mistress
and
gone
over
to
the
guises
who
encouraged
their
enterprises
and
employed
them
to
watch
catherine
chiverni
had
come
from
paris
and
ecouen
the
last
to
arrive
was
who
was
marshal
of
france
and
became
so
important
that
the
guises
whose
creature
he
was
made
him
the
third
person
in
the
triumvirate
they
formed
the
following
year
against
catherine
the
other
who
had
arrived
during
the
night
was
vieilleville
also
a
creature
of
the
guises
and
a
marshal
of
france
who
was
returning
from
a
secret
mission
known
only
to
the
grand
master
who
had
entrusted
it
to
him
as
for
he
was
in
charge
of
military
measures
taken
with
the
object
of
driving
all
reformers
under
arms
into
amboise
a
scheme
which
now
formed
the
subject
of
a
council
held
by
the
duke
and
cardinal
birago
chiverni
vieilleville
and
as
the
two
lorrains
employed
birago
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
they
relied
upon
their
own
powers
for
they
knew
of
his
attachment
to
the
at
this
singular
epoch
the
double
part
played
by
many
of
the
political
men
of
the
day
was
well
known
to
both
parties
they
were
like
cards
in
the
hands
of
gamblers
the
cleverest
player
won
the
game
during
this
council
the
two
brothers
maintained
the
most
impenetrable
reserve
a
conversation
which
now
took
place
between
catherine
and
certain
of
her
friends
will
explain
the
object
of
this
council
held
by
the
guises
in
the
open
air
in
the
hanging
gardens
at
break
of
day
as
if
they
feared
to
speak
within
the
walls
of
the
chateau
de
blois
the
under
pretence
of
examining
the
observatory
then
in
process
of
construction
walked
in
that
direction
accompanied
by
the
two
gondis
glancing
with
a
suspicious
and
inquisitive
eye
at
the
group
of
enemies
who
were
still
standing
at
the
farther
end
of
the
terrace
and
from
whom
chiverni
now
detached
himself
to
join
the
she
was
then
at
the
corner
of
the
terrace
which
looks
down
upon
the
church
of
there
at
least
there
could
be
no
danger
of
the
slightest
overhearing
the
wall
of
the
terrace
is
on
a
level
with
the
towers
of
the
church
and
the
guises
invariably
held
their
council
at
the
farther
corner
of
the
same
terrace
at
the
base
of
the
great
unfinished
keep
or
dungeon
going
and
returning
between
the
perchoir
des
bretons
and
the
gallery
by
the
bridge
which
joined
them
to
the
gardens
no
one
was
within
sight
chiverni
raised
the
hand
of
the
to
kiss
it
and
as
he
did
so
he
slipped
a
little
note
from
his
hand
to
hers
without
being
observed
by
the
two
italians
catherine
turned
to
the
angle
of
the
parapet
and
read
as
follows
you
are
powerful
enough
to
hold
the
balance
between
the
leaders
and
to
force
them
into
a
struggle
as
to
who
shall
serve
you
your
house
is
full
of
kings
and
you
have
nothing
to
fear
from
the
lorrains
or
the
bourbons
provided
you
pit
them
one
against
the
other
for
both
are
striving
to
snatch
the
crown
from
your
children
be
the
mistress
and
not
the
servant
of
your
counsellors
support
them
in
turn
one
against
the
other
or
the
kingdom
will
go
from
bad
to
worse
and
mighty
wars
may
come
of
it
l
hopital
the
queen
put
the
letter
in
the
hollow
of
her
corset
resolving
to
burn
it
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
when
did
you
see
him
she
asked
chiverni
on
my
way
back
from
visiting
the
connetable
at
melun
where
i
met
him
with
the
duchesse
de
berry
whom
he
was
most
impatient
to
convey
to
savoie
that
he
might
return
here
and
open
the
eyes
of
the
chancellor
olivier
who
is
now
completely
duped
by
the
lorrains
as
soon
as
monsieur
l
hopital
saw
the
true
object
of
the
guises
he
determined
to
support
your
interests
that
is
why
he
is
so
anxious
to
get
here
and
give
you
his
vote
at
the
is
he
sincere
asked
catherine
you
know
very
well
that
if
the
lorrains
have
put
him
in
the
council
it
is
that
he
may
help
them
to
l
hopital
is
a
frenchman
who
comes
of
too
good
a
stock
not
to
be
honest
and
sincere
said
chiverni
besides
his
note
is
a
sufficiently
strong
what
answer
did
the
connetable
send
to
the
guises
he
replied
that
he
was
the
servant
of
the
king
and
would
await
his
orders
on
receiving
that
answer
the
cardinal
to
suppress
all
resistance
determined
to
propose
the
appointment
of
his
brother
as
of
the
have
they
got
as
far
as
that
exclaimed
catherine
alarmed
well
did
monsieur
l
hopital
send
me
no
other
message
he
told
me
to
say
to
you
madame
that
you
alone
could
stand
between
the
crown
and
the
does
he
think
that
i
ought
to
use
the
huguenots
as
a
weapon
ah
madame
cried
chiverni
surprised
at
such
astuteness
we
never
dreamed
of
casting
you
into
such
does
he
know
the
position
i
am
in
asked
the
queen
calmly
very
nearly
he
thinks
you
were
duped
after
the
death
of
the
king
into
accepting
that
castle
on
madame
diane
s
overthrow
the
guises
consider
themselves
released
toward
the
queen
by
having
satisfied
the
yes
said
the
queen
looking
at
the
two
gondi
i
made
a
a
blunder
of
the
gods
replied
charles
de
gondi
gentlemen
said
catherine
if
i
go
over
openly
to
the
reformers
i
shall
become
the
slave
of
a
madame
said
chiverni
eagerly
i
approve
entirely
of
your
meaning
you
must
use
them
but
not
serve
though
your
support
does
undoubtedly
for
the
time
being
lie
there
said
charles
de
gondi
we
must
not
conceal
from
ourselves
that
success
and
defeat
are
both
equally
i
know
it
said
the
queen
a
single
false
step
would
be
a
pretext
on
which
the
guises
would
seize
at
once
to
get
rid
of
the
niece
of
a
pope
the
mother
of
four
valois
a
queen
of
france
the
widow
of
the
most
ardent
persecutor
of
the
huguenots
an
italian
catholic
the
aunt
of
leo
can
ally
herself
with
the
reformation
asked
charles
de
gondi
but
said
his
brother
albert
if
she
seconds
the
guises
does
she
not
play
into
the
hands
of
a
usurpation
we
have
to
do
with
men
who
see
a
crown
to
seize
in
the
coming
struggle
between
catholicism
and
reform
it
is
possible
to
support
the
reformers
without
reflect
madame
that
your
family
which
ought
to
have
been
wholly
devoted
to
the
king
of
france
is
at
this
moment
the
servant
of
the
king
of
spain
and
it
will
be
that
of
the
reformation
if
the
reformation
could
make
a
king
of
the
duke
of
i
am
certainly
disposed
to
lend
a
hand
for
a
time
to
the
huguenots
said
catherine
if
only
to
revenge
myself
on
that
soldier
and
that
priest
and
that
woman
as
she
spoke
she
called
attention
with
her
subtile
italian
glance
to
the
duke
and
cardinal
and
then
to
the
second
floor
of
the
chateau
on
which
were
the
apartments
of
her
son
and
mary
stuart
that
trio
has
taken
from
my
hands
the
reins
of
state
for
which
i
waited
long
while
the
old
woman
filled
my
place
she
said
gloomily
glancing
toward
chenonceaux
the
chateau
she
had
lately
exchanged
with
diane
de
poitiers
against
that
of
chaumont
she
added
in
italian
it
seems
that
these
reforming
gentry
in
geneva
have
not
the
wit
to
address
themselves
to
me
and
on
my
conscience
i
can
not
go
to
them
not
one
of
you
would
dare
to
risk
carrying
them
a
message
she
stamped
her
foot
i
did
hope
you
would
have
met
the
cripple
at
ecouen
has
sense
she
said
to
chiverni
the
prince
de
conde
was
there
madame
said
chiverni
but
he
could
not
persuade
the
connetable
to
join
him
monsieur
de
montmorency
wants
to
overthrow
the
guises
who
have
sent
him
into
exile
but
he
will
not
encourage
what
will
ever
break
these
individual
wills
which
are
forever
thwarting
royalty
god
s
truth
exclaimed
the
queen
the
great
nobles
must
be
made
to
destroy
each
other
as
louis
the
greatest
of
your
kings
did
with
those
of
his
time
there
are
four
or
five
parties
now
in
this
kingdom
and
the
weakest
of
them
is
that
of
my
the
reformation
is
an
said
charles
de
gondi
the
parties
that
louis
xi
crushed
were
moved
by
ideas
are
behind
selfish
interests
replied
chiverni
under
louis
xi
the
idea
was
the
great
fiefs
make
heresy
an
axe
said
albert
de
gondi
and
you
will
escape
the
odium
of
ah
cried
the
queen
but
i
am
ignorant
of
the
strength
and
also
of
the
plans
of
the
reformers
and
i
have
no
safe
way
of
communicating
with
them
if
i
were
detected
in
any
manoeuvre
of
that
kind
either
by
the
queen
who
watches
me
like
an
infant
in
a
cradle
or
by
those
two
jailers
over
there
i
should
be
banished
from
france
and
sent
back
to
florence
with
a
terrible
escort
commanded
by
guise
minions
thank
you
no
my
but
i
wish
the
fate
of
being
a
prisoner
in
your
own
home
that
you
may
know
what
you
have
made
me
their
plans
exclaimed
chiverni
the
duke
and
the
cardinal
know
what
they
are
but
those
two
foxes
will
not
divulge
them
if
you
could
induce
them
to
do
so
madame
i
would
sacrifice
myself
for
your
sake
and
come
to
an
understanding
with
the
prince
de
how
much
of
the
guises
own
plans
have
they
been
forced
to
reveal
to
you
asked
the
queen
with
a
glance
at
the
two
brothers
monsieur
de
vieilleville
and
monsieur
de
have
just
received
fresh
orders
the
nature
of
which
is
concealed
from
us
but
i
think
the
duke
is
intending
to
concentrate
his
best
troops
on
the
left
bank
within
a
few
days
you
will
all
be
moved
to
amboise
the
duke
has
been
studying
the
position
from
this
terrace
and
decides
that
blois
is
not
a
propitious
spot
for
his
secret
schemes
what
can
he
want
better
added
chiverni
pointing
to
the
precipices
which
surrounded
the
chateau
there
is
no
place
in
the
world
where
the
court
is
more
secure
from
attack
than
it
is
abdicate
or
reign
said
albert
in
a
low
voice
to
the
queen
who
stood
motionless
and
thoughtful
a
terrible
expression
of
inward
rage
passed
over
the
fine
ivory
face
of
catherine
de
medici
who
was
not
yet
forty
years
old
though
she
had
lived
for
years
at
the
court
of
france
without
power
she
who
from
the
moment
of
her
arrival
intended
to
play
a
leading
part
then
in
her
native
language
the
language
of
dante
these
terrible
words
came
slowly
from
her
lips
nothing
so
long
as
that
son
lives
his
little
wife
bewitches
him
she
added
after
a
pause
catherine
s
exclamation
was
inspired
by
a
prophecy
which
had
been
made
to
her
a
few
days
earlier
at
the
chateau
de
chaumont
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
where
she
had
been
taken
by
ruggieri
her
astrologer
to
obtain
information
as
to
the
lives
of
her
four
children
from
a
celebrated
female
seer
secretly
brought
there
by
nostradamus
chief
among
the
physicians
of
that
great
sixteenth
century
who
practised
like
the
ruggieri
the
cardans
paracelsus
and
others
the
occult
sciences
this
woman
whose
name
and
life
have
eluded
history
foretold
one
year
as
the
length
of
francois
s
reign
give
me
your
opinion
on
all
this
said
catherine
to
chiverni
we
shall
have
a
battle
replied
the
prudent
courtier
the
king
of
navarre
oh
say
the
queen
interrupted
catherine
true
the
queen
said
chiverni
smiling
the
queen
has
given
the
prince
de
conde
as
leader
to
the
reformers
and
he
in
his
position
of
younger
son
can
venture
all
consequently
the
cardinal
talks
of
ordering
him
if
he
comes
cried
the
queen
i
am
saved
thus
the
leaders
of
the
great
movement
of
the
reformation
in
france
were
justified
in
hoping
for
an
ally
in
catherine
de
medici
there
is
one
thing
to
be
considered
said
the
queen
the
bourbons
may
fool
the
huguenots
and
the
sieurs
calvin
and
de
beze
may
fool
the
bourbons
but
are
we
strong
enough
to
fool
huguenots
bourbons
and
guises
in
presence
of
three
such
enemies
it
is
allowable
to
feel
one
s
but
they
have
not
the
king
said
albert
de
gondi
you
will
always
triumph
having
the
king
on
your
muttered
catherine
between
her
teeth
the
lorrains
are
even
now
endeavoring
to
turn
the
burghers
against
you
remarked
birago
the
court
the
hope
of
gaining
the
crown
was
not
the
result
of
a
premeditated
plan
in
the
minds
of
the
restless
guises
nothing
warranted
such
a
hope
or
such
a
plan
circumstances
alone
inspired
their
audacity
the
two
cardinals
and
the
two
balafres
were
four
ambitious
minds
superior
in
talents
to
all
the
other
politicians
who
surrounded
them
this
family
was
never
really
brought
low
except
by
henri
iv
a
factionist
himself
trained
in
the
great
school
of
which
catherine
and
the
guises
were
masters
by
whose
lessons
he
had
profited
but
too
well
at
this
moment
the
two
brothers
the
duke
and
cardinal
were
the
arbiters
of
the
greatest
revolution
attempted
in
europe
since
that
of
henry
viii
in
england
which
was
the
direct
consequence
of
the
invention
of
printing
adversaries
to
the
reformation
they
meant
to
stifle
it
power
being
in
their
hands
but
their
opponent
calvin
though
less
famous
than
luther
was
far
the
stronger
of
the
two
calvin
saw
government
where
luther
saw
dogma
only
while
the
stout
and
amorous
german
fought
with
the
devil
and
flung
an
inkbottle
at
his
head
the
man
from
picardy
a
sickly
celibate
made
plans
of
campaign
directed
battles
armed
princes
and
roused
whole
peoples
by
sowing
republican
doctrines
in
the
hearts
of
the
burghers
recouping
his
continual
defeats
in
the
field
by
fresh
progress
in
the
mind
of
the
nations
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
and
the
duc
de
guise
like
philip
the
second
and
the
duke
of
alba
knew
where
and
when
the
monarchy
was
threatened
and
how
close
the
alliance
ought
to
be
between
catholicism
and
royalty
charles
the
fifth
drunk
with
the
wine
of
charlemagne
s
cup
believing
too
blindly
in
the
strength
of
his
monarchy
and
confident
of
sharing
the
world
with
suleiman
did
not
at
first
feel
the
blow
at
his
head
but
no
sooner
had
cardinal
granvelle
made
him
aware
of
the
extent
of
the
wound
than
he
abdicated
the
guises
had
but
one
scheme
that
of
annihilating
heresy
at
a
single
blow
this
blow
they
were
now
to
attempt
for
the
first
time
to
strike
at
amboise
failing
there
they
tried
it
again
twelve
years
later
at
the
on
the
latter
occasion
in
conjunction
with
catherine
de
medici
enlightened
by
that
time
by
the
flames
of
a
twelve
years
war
enlightened
above
all
by
the
significant
word
republic
uttered
later
and
printed
by
the
writers
of
the
reformation
but
already
foreseen
as
we
have
said
before
by
lecamus
that
type
of
the
parisian
bourgeoisie
the
two
guises
now
on
the
point
of
striking
a
murderous
blow
at
the
heart
of
the
french
nobility
in
order
to
separate
it
once
for
all
from
a
religious
party
whose
triumph
would
be
its
ruin
still
stood
together
on
the
terrace
concerting
as
to
the
best
means
of
revealing
their
etat
to
the
king
while
catherine
was
talking
with
her
counsellors
jeanne
d
albret
knew
what
she
was
about
when
she
declared
herself
protectress
of
the
huguenots
she
has
a
in
the
reformation
and
she
knows
how
to
use
it
said
the
duke
who
fathomed
the
deep
designs
of
the
queen
of
navarre
one
of
the
great
minds
of
the
century
theodore
de
beze
is
now
at
nerac
remarked
the
cardinal
after
first
going
to
geneva
to
take
calvin
s
what
men
these
burghers
know
how
to
find
exclaimed
the
duke
ah
we
have
none
on
our
side
of
the
quality
of
la
renaudie
cried
the
cardinal
he
is
a
true
such
men
always
act
for
their
own
interests
replied
the
duke
didn
t
i
fathom
la
renaudie
i
loaded
him
with
favors
i
helped
him
to
escape
when
he
was
condemned
by
the
parliament
of
bourgogne
i
brought
him
back
from
exile
by
obtaining
a
revision
of
his
sentence
i
intended
to
do
far
more
for
him
and
all
the
while
he
was
plotting
a
diabolical
conspiracy
against
us
that
rascal
has
united
the
protestants
of
germany
with
the
heretics
of
france
by
reconciling
the
differences
that
grew
up
between
the
dogmas
of
luther
and
those
of
calvin
he
has
brought
the
discontented
great
seigneurs
into
the
party
of
the
reformation
without
obliging
them
to
abjure
catholicism
openly
for
the
last
year
he
has
had
thirty
captains
under
him
he
is
everywhere
at
once
at
lyon
in
languedoc
at
nantes
it
was
he
who
drew
up
those
minutes
of
a
consultation
which
were
hawked
about
all
germany
in
which
the
theologians
declared
that
force
might
be
resorted
to
in
order
to
withdraw
the
king
from
our
rule
and
tutelage
the
paper
is
now
being
circulated
from
town
to
town
wherever
we
look
for
him
we
never
find
him
and
yet
i
have
never
done
him
anything
but
good
it
comes
to
this
that
we
must
now
either
thrash
him
like
a
dog
or
try
to
throw
him
a
golden
bridge
by
which
he
will
cross
into
our
bretagne
languedoc
in
fact
the
whole
kingdom
is
in
league
to
deal
us
a
mortal
blow
said
the
cardinal
after
the
fete
was
over
yesterday
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
night
in
reading
the
reports
sent
me
by
the
monks
in
which
i
found
that
the
only
persons
who
have
compromised
themselves
are
poor
gentlemen
artisans
as
to
whom
it
doesn
t
signify
whether
you
hang
them
or
let
them
live
the
colignys
and
condes
do
not
show
their
hand
as
yet
though
they
hold
the
threads
of
the
whole
yes
replied
the
duke
and
therefore
as
soon
as
that
lawyer
avenelles
sold
the
secret
of
the
plot
i
told
braguelonne
to
let
the
conspirators
carry
it
out
they
have
no
suspicion
that
we
know
it
they
are
so
sure
of
surprising
us
that
the
leaders
may
possibly
show
themselves
then
my
advice
is
to
allow
ourselves
to
be
beaten
for
half
an
hour
would
be
too
much
cried
the
cardinal
alarmed
so
this
is
your
courage
is
it
retorted
the
balafre
the
cardinal
quite
unmoved
replied
whether
the
prince
de
conde
is
compromised
or
not
if
we
are
certain
that
he
is
the
leader
we
should
strike
him
down
at
once
and
secure
tranquillity
we
need
judges
rather
than
soldiers
for
this
business
and
judges
are
never
lacking
victory
is
always
more
certain
in
the
parliament
than
on
the
field
and
it
costs
i
consent
willingly
said
the
duke
but
do
you
think
the
prince
de
conde
is
powerful
enough
to
inspire
himself
alone
the
audacity
of
those
who
are
making
this
first
attack
upon
us
isn
t
there
behind
him
the
king
of
navarre
said
the
cardinal
pooh
a
fool
who
speaks
to
me
cap
in
hand
replied
the
duke
the
coquetries
of
that
florentine
woman
seem
to
blind
your
eyes
oh
as
for
that
exclaimed
the
priest
if
i
do
play
the
gallant
with
her
it
is
only
that
i
may
read
to
the
bottom
of
her
she
has
no
heart
said
the
duke
sharply
she
is
even
more
ambitious
than
you
and
you
are
a
brave
soldier
said
the
cardinal
but
believe
me
i
distance
you
in
this
matter
i
have
had
catherine
watched
by
mary
stuart
long
before
you
even
suspected
her
she
has
no
more
religion
than
my
shoe
if
she
is
not
the
soul
of
this
plot
it
is
not
for
want
of
will
but
we
shall
now
be
able
to
test
her
on
the
scene
itself
and
find
out
then
how
she
stands
by
us
up
to
this
time
however
i
am
certain
she
has
held
no
communication
whatever
with
the
well
it
is
time
now
to
reveal
the
whole
plot
to
the
king
and
to
the
who
you
say
knows
nothing
of
it
that
is
the
sole
proof
of
her
innocence
perhaps
the
conspirators
have
waited
till
the
last
moment
expecting
to
dazzle
her
with
the
probabilities
of
success
la
renaudie
must
soon
discover
by
my
arrangements
that
we
are
warned
last
night
nemours
was
to
follow
detachments
of
the
reformers
who
are
pouring
in
along
the
and
the
conspirators
will
be
forced
to
attack
us
at
amboise
which
place
i
intend
to
let
them
enter
here
added
the
duke
pointing
to
three
sides
of
the
rock
on
which
the
chateau
de
blois
is
built
we
should
have
an
assault
without
any
result
the
huguenots
could
come
and
go
at
will
blois
is
an
open
hall
with
four
entrances
whereas
amboise
is
a
sack
with
a
single
i
shall
not
leave
catherine
s
side
said
the
cardinal
we
have
made
a
blunder
remarked
the
duke
who
was
playing
with
his
dagger
tossing
it
into
the
air
and
catching
it
by
the
hilt
we
ought
to
have
treated
her
as
we
did
the
reformers
given
her
complete
freedom
of
action
and
caught
her
in
the
the
cardinal
looked
at
his
brother
for
an
instant
and
shook
his
head
what
does
pardaillan
want
said
the
duke
observing
the
approach
of
the
young
nobleman
who
was
later
to
become
celebrated
by
his
encounter
with
la
renaudie
in
which
they
both
lost
their
lives
monseigneur
a
man
sent
by
the
queen
s
furrier
is
at
the
gate
and
says
he
has
an
ermine
suit
to
convey
to
her
am
i
to
let
him
enter
ah
yes
the
ermine
coat
she
spoke
of
yesterday
returned
the
cardinal
let
the
pass
she
will
want
the
garment
for
the
voyage
down
the
how
did
he
get
here
without
being
stopped
until
he
reached
the
gate
asked
the
duke
i
do
not
know
replied
pardaillan
i
ll
ask
to
see
him
when
he
is
with
the
queen
thought
the
balafre
let
him
wait
in
the
des
he
said
aloud
is
he
young
pardaillan
yes
monseigneur
he
says
he
is
a
son
of
lecamus
the
lecamus
is
a
good
catholic
remarked
the
cardinal
who
like
his
brother
the
duke
was
endowed
with
caesar
s
memory
the
rector
of
relies
upon
him
he
is
the
provost
of
that
nevertheless
said
the
duke
make
the
son
talk
with
the
captain
of
the
scotch
guard
laying
an
emphasis
on
the
verb
which
was
readily
understood
ambroise
is
in
the
chateau
he
can
tell
us
whether
the
fellow
is
really
the
son
of
lecamus
for
the
old
man
did
him
good
service
in
times
past
send
for
ambroise
it
was
at
this
moment
that
queen
catherine
went
unattended
toward
the
two
brothers
who
hastened
to
meet
her
with
their
accustomed
show
of
respect
in
which
the
italian
princess
detected
constant
irony
messieurs
she
said
will
you
deign
to
inform
me
of
what
is
about
to
take
place
is
the
widow
of
your
former
master
of
less
importance
in
your
esteem
than
the
sieurs
vieilleville
birago
and
chiverni
madame
replied
the
cardinal
in
a
tone
of
gallantry
our
duty
as
men
taking
precedence
of
that
of
statecraft
forbids
us
to
alarm
the
fair
sex
by
false
reports
but
this
morning
there
is
indeed
good
reason
to
confer
with
you
on
the
affairs
of
the
country
you
must
excuse
my
brother
for
having
already
given
orders
to
the
gentlemen
you
mention
orders
which
were
purely
military
and
therefore
did
not
concern
you
the
matters
of
real
importance
are
still
to
be
decided
if
you
are
willing
we
will
now
go
the
of
the
king
and
queen
it
is
nearly
but
what
is
all
this
monsieur
le
duc
cried
catherine
pretending
alarm
is
anything
the
matter
the
reformation
madame
is
no
longer
a
mere
heresy
it
is
a
party
which
has
taken
arms
and
is
coming
here
to
snatch
the
king
away
from
catherine
the
cardinal
the
duke
and
the
three
gentlemen
made
their
way
to
the
staircase
through
the
gallery
which
was
crowded
with
courtiers
who
being
off
duty
no
longer
had
the
right
of
entrance
to
the
royal
apartments
and
stood
in
two
hedges
on
either
side
gondi
who
watched
them
while
the
talked
with
the
lorraine
princes
whispered
in
her
ear
in
good
tuscan
two
words
which
afterwards
became
proverbs
words
which
are
the
keynote
to
one
aspect
of
her
regal
character
odiate
e
aspettate
hate
and
pardaillan
who
had
gone
to
order
the
officer
of
the
guard
at
the
gate
of
the
chateau
to
let
the
clerk
of
the
queen
s
furrier
enter
found
christophe
before
the
portal
staring
at
the
facade
built
by
the
good
king
louis
on
which
there
was
at
that
time
a
much
greater
number
of
grotesque
carvings
than
we
see
there
grotesque
that
is
to
say
if
we
may
judge
by
those
that
remain
to
us
for
instance
persons
curious
in
such
matters
may
remark
the
figurine
of
a
woman
carved
on
the
capital
of
one
of
the
portal
columns
with
her
robe
caught
up
to
show
to
a
stout
monk
crouching
in
the
capital
of
the
corresponding
column
that
which
brunelle
showed
to
marphise
while
above
this
portal
stood
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
the
statue
of
louis
xii
several
of
the
of
this
facade
carved
in
the
same
style
and
now
unfortunately
destroyed
amused
or
seemed
to
amuse
christophe
on
whom
the
arquebusiers
of
the
guard
were
raining
jests
he
would
like
to
live
there
said
the
playing
with
the
cartridges
of
his
weapon
which
were
prepared
for
use
in
the
shape
of
little
and
slung
to
the
baldricks
of
the
men
hey
parisian
said
another
you
never
saw
the
like
of
that
did
you
he
recognizes
the
good
king
louis
said
a
third
christophe
pretended
not
to
hear
and
tried
to
exaggerate
his
amazement
the
result
being
that
his
silly
attitude
and
his
behavior
before
the
guard
proved
an
excellent
passport
to
the
eyes
of
pardaillan
the
queen
has
not
yet
risen
said
the
young
captain
come
and
wait
for
her
in
the
des
christophe
followed
pardaillan
rather
slowly
on
the
way
he
stopped
to
admire
the
pretty
gallery
in
the
form
of
an
arcade
where
the
courtiers
of
louis
xii
awaited
the
when
it
rained
and
where
at
the
present
moment
were
several
seigneurs
attached
to
the
guises
for
the
staircase
so
well
preserved
to
the
present
day
which
led
to
their
apartments
is
at
the
end
of
this
gallery
in
a
tower
the
architecture
of
which
commends
itself
to
the
admiration
of
intelligent
beholders
well
well
did
you
come
here
to
study
the
carving
of
images
cried
pardaillan
as
christophe
stopped
before
the
charming
sculptures
of
the
balustrade
which
unites
or
if
you
prefer
it
separates
the
columns
of
each
arcade
christophe
followed
the
young
officer
to
the
grand
staircase
not
without
a
glance
of
ecstasy
at
the
tower
the
weather
was
fine
and
the
court
was
crowded
with
and
seigneurs
talking
together
in
little
groups
their
dazzling
uniforms
and
brightening
a
spot
which
the
marvels
of
architecture
then
fresh
and
new
had
already
made
so
brilliant
come
in
here
said
pardaillan
making
lecamus
a
sign
to
follow
him
through
a
carved
wooden
door
leading
to
the
second
floor
which
the
opened
on
recognizing
the
young
officer
it
is
easy
to
imagine
christophe
s
amazement
as
he
entered
the
great
des
then
so
vast
that
military
necessity
has
since
divided
it
by
a
partition
into
two
chambers
it
occupied
on
the
second
floor
that
of
the
king
as
did
the
corresponding
hall
on
the
first
floor
that
of
the
one
third
of
the
whole
front
of
the
chateau
facing
the
courtyard
and
it
was
lighted
by
two
windows
to
right
and
two
to
left
of
the
tower
in
which
the
famous
staircase
winds
up
the
young
captain
went
to
the
door
of
the
royal
chamber
which
opened
upon
this
vast
hall
and
told
one
of
the
two
pages
on
duty
to
inform
madame
dayelles
the
queen
s
bedchamber
woman
that
the
furrier
was
in
the
hall
with
her
surcoat
on
a
sign
from
pardaillan
christophe
placed
himself
near
an
officer
who
was
seated
on
a
stool
at
the
corner
of
a
fireplace
as
large
as
his
father
s
whole
shop
which
was
at
the
end
of
the
great
hall
opposite
to
a
precisely
similar
fireplace
at
the
other
end
while
talking
to
this
officer
a
lieutenant
he
contrived
to
interest
him
with
an
account
of
the
stagnation
of
trade
christophe
seemed
so
thoroughly
a
shopkeeper
that
the
officer
imparted
that
conviction
to
the
captain
of
the
scotch
guard
who
came
in
from
the
courtyard
to
question
lecamus
all
the
while
watching
him
covertly
and
narrowly
however
much
christophe
lecamus
had
been
warned
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
really
apprehend
the
cold
ferocity
of
the
interests
between
which
chaudieu
had
slipped
him
to
an
observer
of
this
scene
who
had
known
the
secrets
of
it
as
the
historian
understands
it
in
the
light
of
there
was
indeed
cause
to
tremble
for
this
young
man
the
hope
of
two
families
thrust
between
those
powerful
and
pitiless
machines
catherine
and
the
guises
but
do
courageous
beings
as
a
rule
measure
the
full
extent
of
their
dangers
by
the
way
in
which
the
port
of
blois
the
chateau
and
the
town
were
guarded
christophe
was
prepared
to
find
spies
and
traps
everywhere
and
he
therefore
resolved
to
conceal
the
importance
of
his
mission
and
the
tension
of
his
mind
under
the
and
shopkeeping
appearance
with
which
he
presented
himself
to
the
eyes
of
young
pardaillan
the
officer
of
the
guard
and
the
scottish
captain
the
agitation
which
in
a
royal
castle
always
attends
the
hour
of
the
king
s
rising
was
beginning
to
show
itself
the
great
lords
whose
horses
pages
or
grooms
remained
in
the
outer
courtyard
for
no
one
except
the
king
and
the
queens
had
the
right
to
enter
the
inner
courtyard
on
horseback
were
mounting
by
groups
the
magnificent
staircase
and
filling
by
degrees
the
vast
hall
the
beams
of
which
are
now
stripped
of
the
decorations
that
then
adorned
them
miserable
little
red
tiles
have
replaced
the
ingenious
mosaics
of
the
floors
and
the
thick
walls
then
draped
with
the
crown
tapestries
and
glowing
with
all
the
arts
of
that
unique
period
of
the
splendors
of
humanity
are
now
denuded
and
whitewashed
reformers
and
catholics
were
pressing
in
to
hear
the
news
and
to
watch
faces
quite
as
much
as
to
pay
their
duty
to
the
king
francois
s
excessive
love
for
mary
stuart
to
which
neither
the
nor
the
guises
made
any
opposition
and
the
politic
compliance
of
mary
stuart
herself
deprived
the
king
of
all
regal
power
at
seventeen
years
of
age
he
knew
nothing
of
royalty
but
its
pleasures
or
of
marriage
beyond
the
indulgence
of
first
passion
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
present
paid
their
court
to
queen
mary
and
to
her
uncles
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
and
the
duc
de
guise
rather
than
to
the
king
this
stir
took
place
before
christophe
who
watched
the
arrival
of
each
new
personage
with
natural
eagerness
a
magnificent
portiere
on
either
side
of
which
stood
two
pages
and
two
soldiers
of
the
scotch
guard
then
on
duty
showed
him
the
entrance
to
the
royal
chamber
the
chamber
so
fatal
to
the
son
of
the
present
duc
de
guise
the
second
balafre
who
fell
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
now
occupied
by
mary
stuart
and
francois
ii
the
queen
s
maids
of
honor
surrounded
the
fireplace
opposite
to
that
where
christophe
was
being
talked
with
by
the
captain
of
the
guard
this
second
fireplace
was
considered
the
of
it
was
built
in
the
thick
wall
of
the
salle
de
conseil
between
the
door
of
the
royal
chamber
and
that
of
the
so
that
the
maids
of
honor
and
the
lords
in
waiting
who
had
the
right
to
be
there
were
on
the
direct
passage
of
the
king
and
queen
the
courtiers
were
certain
on
this
occasion
of
seeing
catherine
for
her
maids
of
honor
dressed
like
the
rest
of
the
court
ladies
in
black
came
up
the
staircase
from
the
s
apartment
and
took
their
places
marshalled
by
the
comtesse
de
fiesque
on
the
side
toward
the
and
opposite
to
the
maids
of
honor
of
the
young
queen
led
by
the
duchesse
de
guise
who
occupied
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
on
the
side
of
the
royal
bedroom
the
courtiers
left
an
open
space
between
the
ranks
of
these
young
ladies
who
all
belonged
to
the
first
families
of
the
kingdom
which
none
but
the
greatest
lords
had
the
right
to
enter
the
comtesse
de
fiesque
and
the
duchesse
de
guise
were
in
virtue
of
their
office
seated
in
the
midst
of
these
noble
maids
who
were
all
standing
the
first
gentleman
who
approached
the
dangerous
ranks
was
the
duc
d
orleans
the
king
s
brother
who
had
come
down
from
his
apartment
on
the
third
floor
accompanied
by
monsieur
de
cypierre
his
governor
this
young
prince
destined
before
the
end
of
the
year
to
reign
under
the
title
of
charles
was
only
ten
years
old
and
extremely
timid
the
duc
d
anjou
and
the
duc
d
alencon
his
younger
brothers
also
the
princesse
marguerite
afterwards
the
wife
of
henri
iv
la
reine
margot
were
too
young
to
come
to
court
and
were
therefore
kept
by
their
mother
in
her
own
apartments
the
duc
d
orleans
richly
dressed
after
the
fashion
of
the
times
in
silken
a
jacket
of
cloth
of
gold
embroidered
with
black
flowers
and
a
little
mantle
of
embroidered
velvet
all
black
for
he
still
wore
mourning
for
his
father
bowed
to
the
two
ladies
of
honor
and
took
his
place
beside
his
mother
s
maids
already
full
of
antipathy
for
the
adherents
of
the
house
of
guise
he
replied
coldly
to
the
remarks
of
the
duchess
and
leaned
his
arm
on
the
back
of
the
chair
of
the
comtesse
de
fiesque
his
governor
monsieur
de
cypierre
one
of
the
noblest
characters
of
that
day
stood
beside
him
like
a
shield
amyot
afterwards
bishop
of
auxerre
and
translator
of
plutarch
in
the
simple
soutane
of
an
abbe
also
accompanied
the
young
prince
being
his
tutor
as
he
was
of
the
two
other
princes
whose
affection
became
so
profitable
to
him
between
the
chimney
of
honor
and
the
other
chimney
at
the
end
of
the
hall
around
which
were
grouped
the
guards
their
captain
a
few
courtiers
and
christophe
carrying
his
box
of
furs
the
chancellor
olivier
protector
and
predecessor
of
l
hopital
in
the
robes
which
the
chancellors
of
france
have
always
worn
was
walking
up
and
down
with
the
cardinal
de
tournon
who
had
recently
returned
from
rome
the
pair
were
exchanging
a
few
whispered
sentences
in
the
midst
of
great
attention
from
the
lords
of
the
court
massed
against
the
wall
which
separated
the
des
from
the
royal
bedroom
like
a
living
tapestry
backed
by
the
rich
tapestry
of
art
crowded
by
a
thousand
personages
in
spite
of
the
present
grave
events
the
court
presented
the
appearance
of
all
courts
in
all
lands
at
all
epochs
and
in
the
midst
of
the
greatest
dangers
the
courtiers
talked
of
trivial
matters
thinking
of
serious
ones
they
jested
as
they
studied
faces
and
apparently
concerned
themselves
about
love
and
the
marriage
of
rich
heiresses
amid
the
bloodiest
catastrophes
what
did
you
think
of
yesterday
s
fete
asked
bourdeilles
seigneur
of
brantome
approaching
mademoiselle
de
piennes
one
of
the
s
maids
of
honor
messieurs
du
baif
et
du
bellay
were
inspired
with
delightful
ideas
she
replied
indicating
the
organizers
of
the
fete
who
were
standing
near
i
thought
it
all
in
the
worst
taste
she
added
in
a
low
voice
you
had
no
part
to
play
in
it
i
think
remarked
mademoiselle
de
lewiston
from
the
opposite
ranks
of
queen
mary
s
maids
what
are
you
reading
there
madame
asked
amyot
of
the
comtesse
de
fiesque
amadis
de
gaule
by
the
seigneur
des
essarts
commissary
in
ordinary
to
the
king
s
artillery
she
replied
a
charming
work
remarked
the
beautiful
girl
who
was
afterwards
so
celebrated
under
the
name
of
fosseuse
when
she
was
lady
of
honor
to
queen
marguerite
of
navarre
the
style
is
a
novelty
in
form
said
amyot
do
you
accept
such
barbarisms
he
added
addressing
brantome
they
please
the
ladies
you
know
said
brantome
crossing
over
to
the
duchesse
de
guise
who
held
the
decamerone
in
her
hand
some
of
the
women
of
your
house
must
appear
in
the
book
madame
he
said
it
is
a
pity
that
the
sieur
boccaccio
did
not
live
in
our
day
he
would
have
known
plenty
of
ladies
to
swell
his
volume
how
shrewd
that
monsieur
de
brantome
is
said
the
beautiful
mademoiselle
de
limueil
to
the
comtesse
de
fiesque
he
came
to
us
first
but
he
means
to
remain
in
the
guise
hush
said
madame
de
fiesque
glancing
at
the
beautiful
limueil
attend
to
what
concerns
the
young
girl
turned
her
eyes
to
the
door
she
was
expecting
sardini
a
noble
italian
with
whom
the
her
relative
married
her
after
an
accident
which
happened
in
the
of
catherine
de
medici
herself
but
which
the
young
lady
won
the
honor
of
having
a
queen
as
midwife
by
the
holy
alipantin
mademoiselle
davila
seems
to
me
prettier
and
prettier
every
morning
said
monsieur
de
robertet
secretary
of
state
bowing
to
the
ladies
of
the
the
arrival
of
the
secretary
of
state
made
no
commotion
whatever
though
his
office
was
precisely
what
that
of
a
minister
is
in
these
days
if
you
really
think
so
monsieur
said
the
beauty
lend
me
the
squib
which
was
written
against
the
messieurs
de
guise
i
know
it
was
lent
to
it
is
no
longer
in
my
possession
replied
the
secretary
turning
round
to
bow
to
the
duchesse
de
guise
i
have
it
said
the
comte
de
grammont
to
mademoiselle
davila
but
i
will
give
it
you
on
one
condition
condition
fie
exclaimed
madame
de
fiesque
you
don
t
know
what
it
is
replied
grammont
oh
it
is
easy
to
guess
remarked
la
limueil
the
italian
custom
of
calling
ladies
as
peasants
call
their
wives
was
then
the
fashion
at
the
court
of
france
you
are
mistaken
said
the
count
hastily
the
matter
is
simply
to
give
a
letter
from
my
cousin
de
jarnac
to
one
of
the
maids
on
the
other
side
mademoiselle
de
you
must
not
compromise
my
young
ladies
said
the
comtesse
de
fiesque
i
will
deliver
the
letter
do
you
know
what
is
happening
in
flanders
she
continued
turning
to
the
cardinal
de
tournon
it
seems
that
monsieur
d
egmont
is
given
to
he
and
the
prince
of
orange
remarked
cypierre
with
a
significant
shrug
of
his
shoulders
the
duke
of
alba
and
cardinal
granvelle
are
going
there
are
they
not
monsieur
said
amyot
to
the
cardinal
de
tournon
who
remained
standing
gloomy
and
anxious
between
the
opposing
groups
after
his
conversation
with
the
chancellor
happily
we
are
at
peace
we
need
only
conquer
heresy
on
the
stage
remarked
the
young
duc
d
orleans
alluding
to
a
part
he
had
played
the
night
before
that
of
a
knight
subduing
a
hydra
which
bore
upon
its
foreheads
the
word
catherine
de
medici
agreeing
in
this
with
her
had
allowed
a
theatre
to
be
made
of
the
great
hall
afterwards
arranged
for
the
parliament
of
blois
which
as
we
have
already
said
connected
the
chateau
of
francois
with
that
of
louis
xii
the
cardinal
made
no
answer
to
amyot
s
question
but
resumed
his
walk
through
the
centre
of
the
hall
talking
in
low
tones
with
monsieur
de
robertet
and
the
chancellor
many
persons
are
ignorant
of
the
difficulties
which
secretaries
of
state
subsequently
called
ministers
met
with
at
the
first
establishment
of
their
office
and
how
much
trouble
the
kings
of
france
had
in
creating
it
at
this
epoch
a
secretary
of
state
like
robertet
was
purely
and
simply
a
writer
he
counted
for
almost
nothing
among
the
princes
and
grandees
who
decided
the
affairs
of
state
his
functions
were
little
more
than
those
of
the
superintendent
of
finances
the
chancellor
and
the
keeper
of
the
seals
the
kings
granted
seats
at
the
council
by
to
those
of
their
subjects
whose
advice
seemed
to
them
useful
in
the
management
of
public
affairs
entrance
to
the
council
was
given
in
this
way
to
a
president
of
the
chamber
of
parliament
to
a
bishop
or
to
an
untitled
favorite
once
admitted
to
the
council
the
subject
strengthened
his
position
there
by
obtaining
various
crown
offices
on
which
devolved
such
prerogatives
as
the
sword
of
a
constable
the
government
of
provinces
the
of
artillery
the
baton
of
a
marshal
a
leading
rank
in
the
army
or
the
admiralty
or
a
captaincy
of
the
galleys
often
some
office
at
court
like
that
of
of
the
household
now
held
as
we
have
already
said
by
the
duc
de
guise
do
you
think
that
the
duc
de
nemours
will
marry
francoise
said
madame
de
guise
to
the
tutor
of
the
duc
d
orleans
ah
madame
he
replied
i
know
nothing
but
this
answer
made
all
who
were
within
hearing
of
it
smile
the
seduction
of
francoise
de
rohan
by
the
duc
de
nemours
was
the
topic
of
all
conversations
but
as
the
duke
was
cousin
to
francois
and
doubly
allied
to
the
house
of
valois
through
his
mother
the
guises
regarded
him
more
as
the
seduced
than
the
seducer
nevertheless
the
power
of
the
house
of
rohan
was
such
that
the
duc
de
nemours
was
obliged
after
the
death
of
francois
to
leave
france
on
consequence
of
suits
brought
against
him
by
the
rohans
which
suits
the
guises
settled
the
duke
s
marriage
with
the
duchesse
de
guise
after
poltrot
s
assassination
of
her
husband
in
may
explain
the
question
which
she
put
to
amyot
by
revealing
the
rivalry
which
must
have
existed
between
mademoiselle
de
rohan
and
the
duchess
do
see
that
group
of
the
discontented
over
there
said
the
comte
de
grammont
motioning
toward
the
messieurs
de
coligny
the
cardinal
de
chatillon
danville
thore
moret
and
several
other
seigneurs
suspected
of
tampering
with
the
reformation
who
were
standing
between
two
windows
on
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
the
huguenots
are
bestirring
themselves
said
cypierre
we
know
that
theodore
de
beze
has
gone
to
nerac
to
induce
the
queen
of
navarre
to
declare
for
the
reformers
by
abjuring
publicly
he
added
looking
at
the
of
orleans
who
held
the
office
of
chancellor
to
the
queen
of
navarre
and
was
watching
the
court
attentively
she
will
do
it
said
the
dryly
this
personage
the
orleans
jacques
coeur
one
of
the
richest
burghers
of
the
day
was
named
groslot
and
had
charge
of
jeanne
d
albret
s
business
with
the
court
of
france
do
you
really
think
so
said
the
chancellor
of
france
appreciating
the
full
importance
of
groslot
s
declaration
are
you
not
aware
said
the
burgher
that
the
queen
of
navarre
has
nothing
of
the
woman
in
her
except
sex
she
is
wholly
for
things
virile
her
powerful
mind
turns
to
the
great
affairs
of
state
her
heart
is
invincible
under
monsieur
le
cardinal
whispered
the
chancellor
olivier
to
monsieur
de
tournon
who
had
overheard
groslot
what
do
you
think
of
that
audacity
the
queen
of
navarre
did
well
in
choosing
for
her
chancellor
a
man
from
whom
the
house
of
lorraine
borrows
money
and
who
offers
his
house
to
the
king
if
his
majesty
visits
orleans
replied
the
cardinal
the
chancellor
and
the
cardinal
looked
at
each
other
without
venturing
to
further
communicate
their
thoughts
but
robertet
expressed
them
for
he
thought
it
necessary
to
show
more
devotion
to
the
guises
than
these
great
personages
inasmuch
as
he
was
smaller
than
they
it
is
a
great
misfortune
that
the
house
of
navarre
instead
of
abjuring
the
religion
of
its
fathers
does
not
abjure
the
spirit
of
vengeance
and
rebellion
which
the
connetable
de
bourbon
breathed
into
it
he
said
aloud
we
shall
see
the
quarrels
of
the
armagnacs
and
the
bourguignons
revive
in
our
no
said
groslot
there
s
another
louis
xi
in
the
cardinal
de
and
also
in
queen
catherine
replied
robertet
at
this
moment
madame
dayelle
the
favorite
bedchamber
woman
of
queen
mary
stuart
crossed
the
hall
and
went
toward
the
royal
chamber
her
passage
caused
a
general
commotion
we
shall
soon
enter
said
madame
de
fisque
i
don
t
think
so
replied
the
duchesse
de
guise
their
majesties
will
come
out
a
grand
council
is
to
be
vi
the
little
lever
of
francois
ii
madame
dayelle
glided
into
the
royal
chamber
after
scratching
on
the
door
a
respectful
custom
invented
by
catherine
de
medici
and
adopted
by
the
court
of
france
how
is
the
weather
my
dear
dayelle
said
queen
mary
showing
her
fresh
young
face
out
of
the
bed
and
shaking
the
curtains
ah
madame
what
s
the
matter
my
dayelle
you
look
as
if
the
archers
of
the
guard
were
after
oh
madame
is
the
king
still
asleep
we
are
to
leave
the
chateau
monsieur
le
cardinal
requests
me
to
tell
you
so
and
to
ask
you
to
make
the
king
agree
to
it
do
you
know
why
my
good
dayelle
the
reformers
want
to
seize
you
and
carry
you
ah
that
new
religion
does
not
leave
me
a
minute
s
peace
i
dreamed
last
night
that
i
was
in
prison
i
who
will
some
day
unite
the
crowns
of
the
three
noblest
kingdoms
in
the
world
therefore
it
could
only
be
a
dream
carry
me
off
well
twould
be
rather
pleasant
but
on
account
of
religion
and
by
heretics
oh
that
would
be
the
queen
sprang
from
the
bed
and
placed
herself
in
a
large
of
red
velvet
before
the
fireplace
after
dayelle
had
given
her
a
of
black
velvet
which
she
fastened
loosely
round
her
waist
by
a
silken
cord
dayelle
lit
the
fire
for
the
mornings
are
cool
on
the
banks
of
the
loire
in
the
month
of
may
my
uncles
must
have
received
some
news
during
the
night
said
the
queen
inquiringly
to
dayelle
whom
she
treated
with
great
familiarity
messieurs
de
guise
have
been
walking
together
from
early
morning
on
the
terrace
so
as
not
to
be
overheard
by
any
one
and
there
they
received
messengers
who
came
in
hot
haste
from
all
the
different
points
of
the
kingdom
where
the
reformers
are
stirring
madame
la
reine
mere
was
there
too
with
her
italians
hoping
she
would
be
consulted
but
no
she
was
not
admitted
to
the
she
must
have
been
all
the
more
because
she
was
so
angry
yesterday
replied
dayelle
they
say
that
when
she
saw
your
majesty
appear
in
that
beautiful
dress
of
woven
gold
with
the
charming
veil
of
crape
she
was
none
too
pleased
leave
us
my
good
dayelle
the
king
is
waking
up
let
no
one
even
those
who
have
the
little
disturb
us
an
affair
of
state
is
in
hand
and
my
uncles
will
not
disturb
why
my
dear
mary
already
out
of
bed
is
it
daylight
said
the
young
king
waking
up
my
dear
darling
while
we
were
asleep
the
wicked
waked
and
now
they
are
forcing
us
to
leave
this
delightful
what
makes
you
think
of
wicked
people
my
treasure
i
am
sure
we
enjoyed
the
prettiest
fete
in
the
world
last
night
if
it
were
not
for
the
latin
words
those
gentlemen
will
put
into
our
ah
said
mary
your
language
is
really
in
very
good
taste
and
rabelais
exhibits
it
you
are
such
a
learned
woman
i
am
so
vexed
that
i
can
t
sing
your
praises
in
verse
if
i
were
not
the
king
i
would
take
my
brother
s
tutor
amyot
and
let
him
make
me
as
accomplished
as
you
need
not
envy
your
brother
who
writes
verses
and
shows
them
to
me
asking
for
mine
in
return
you
are
the
best
of
the
four
and
will
make
as
good
a
king
as
you
are
the
dearest
of
lovers
perhaps
that
is
why
your
mother
does
not
like
you
but
never
mind
i
dear
heart
will
love
you
for
all
the
i
have
no
great
merit
in
loving
such
a
perfect
queen
said
the
little
king
i
don
t
know
what
prevented
me
from
kissing
you
before
the
whole
court
when
you
danced
the
with
the
torches
last
night
i
saw
plainly
that
all
the
other
women
were
mere
servants
compared
to
you
my
beautiful
it
may
be
only
prose
you
speak
but
it
is
ravishing
speech
dear
darling
for
it
is
love
that
says
those
words
and
you
you
know
well
my
beloved
that
were
you
only
a
poor
little
page
i
should
love
you
as
much
as
i
do
now
and
yet
there
is
nothing
so
sweet
as
to
whisper
to
one
s
self
my
lover
is
king
oh
the
pretty
arm
why
must
we
dress
ourselves
i
love
to
pass
my
fingers
through
your
silky
hair
and
tangle
its
blond
curls
ah
ca
sweet
one
don
t
let
your
women
kiss
that
pretty
throat
and
those
white
shoulders
any
more
don
t
allow
it
i
say
it
is
too
much
that
the
fogs
of
scotland
ever
touched
them
won
t
you
come
with
me
to
see
my
dear
country
the

rebellions

in
this
our
kingdom
said
francois
crossing
his
and
taking
mary
stuart
on
his
knee
oh
tis
all
very
charming
i
know
that
she
said
withdrawing
her
cheek
from
the
king
but
it
is
your
business
to
reign
if
you
please
my
sweet
why
talk
of
reigning
this
morning
i
wish
why
say
when
you
have
only
to
will
all
that
s
not
the
speech
of
a
king
nor
that
of
a
but
no
more
of
love
just
now
let
us
drop
it
we
have
business
more
important
to
speak
oh
cried
the
king
it
is
long
since
we
have
had
any
business
is
it
amusing
no
said
mary
not
at
all
we
are
to
move
from
i
ll
wager
darling
you
have
seen
your
uncles
who
manage
so
well
that
i
at
seventeen
years
of
age
am
no
better
than
a
in
fact
i
don
t
know
why
i
have
attended
any
of
the
councils
since
the
first
they
could
manage
matters
just
as
well
by
putting
the
crown
in
my
chair
i
see
only
through
their
eyes
and
am
forced
to
consent
to
things
oh
monsieur
said
the
queen
rising
from
the
king
s
knee
with
a
little
air
of
indignation
you
said
you
would
never
worry
me
again
on
this
subject
and
that
my
uncles
used
the
royal
power
only
for
the
good
of
your
people
your
people
they
are
so
nice
they
would
gobble
you
up
like
a
strawberry
if
you
tried
to
rule
them
yourself
you
want
a
warrior
a
rough
master
with
mailed
hands
whereas
you
you
are
a
darling
whom
i
love
as
you
are
whom
i
should
never
love
otherwise
do
you
hear
me
monsieur
she
added
kissing
the
forehead
of
the
lad
who
seemed
inclined
to
rebel
at
her
speech
but
softened
at
her
kisses
oh
how
i
wish
they
were
not
your
uncles
cried
francois
ii
i
particularly
dislike
the
cardinal
and
when
he
puts
on
his
wheedling
air
and
his
submissive
manner
and
says
to
me
bowing
sire
the
honor
of
the
crown
and
the
faith
of
your
fathers
forbid
your
majesty
to
this
and
that
i
am
sure
he
is
working
only
for
his
cursed
house
of
oh
how
well
you
mimicked
him
cried
the
queen
but
why
don
t
you
make
the
guises
inform
you
of
what
is
going
on
so
that
when
you
attain
your
grand
majority
you
may
know
how
to
reign
yourself
i
am
your
wife
and
your
honor
is
mine
trust
me
we
will
reign
together
my
darling
but
it
won
t
be
a
bed
of
roses
for
us
until
the
day
comes
when
we
have
our
own
wills
there
is
nothing
so
difficult
for
a
king
as
to
reign
am
i
a
queen
for
example
don
t
you
know
that
your
mother
returns
me
evil
for
all
the
good
my
uncles
do
to
raise
the
splendor
of
your
throne
hey
what
difference
between
them
my
uncles
are
great
princes
nephews
of
charlemagne
filled
with
ardor
and
ready
to
die
for
you
whereas
this
daughter
of
a
doctor
or
a
shopkeeper
queen
of
france
by
accident
scolds
like
a
who
can
t
manage
her
own
household
she
is
discontented
because
she
can
t
set
every
one
by
the
ears
and
then
she
looks
at
me
with
a
sour
pale
face
and
says
from
her
pinched
lips
my
daughter
you
are
a
queen
i
am
only
the
second
woman
in
the
kingdom
she
is
really
furious
you
know
my
darling
but
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
should
not
wear
crimson
velvet
while
all
the
court
is
in
mourning
neither
should
i
appear
in
public
with
my
own
hair
and
no
jewels
because
what
is
not
becoming
in
a
simple
lady
is
still
less
becoming
in
a
queen
also
i
should
not
dance
myself
i
should
content
myself
with
seeing
others
that
is
what
she
says
to
me
heavens
cried
the
king
i
think
i
hear
her
coming
if
she
were
to
know
oh
how
you
tremble
before
her
she
worries
you
only
say
so
and
we
will
send
her
away
faith
she
s
florentine
and
we
can
t
help
her
tricking
you
but
when
it
comes
to
worrying
for
heaven
s
sake
mary
hold
your
tongue
said
francois
frightened
and
also
pleased
i
don
t
want
you
to
lose
her
don
t
be
afraid
that
she
will
ever
break
with
who
will
some
day
wear
the
three
noblest
crowns
in
the
world
my
dearest
little
king
cried
mary
stuart
though
she
hates
me
for
a
thousand
reasons
she
is
always
caressing
me
in
the
hope
of
turning
me
against
my
hates
you
yes
my
angel
and
if
i
had
not
proofs
of
that
feeling
such
as
women
only
understand
for
they
alone
know
its
malignity
i
would
forgive
her
perpetual
opposition
to
our
dear
love
my
darling
is
it
my
fault
that
your
father
could
not
endure
mademoiselle
medici
or
that
his
son
loves
me
the
truth
is
she
hates
me
so
much
that
if
you
had
not
put
yourself
into
a
rage
we
should
each
have
had
our
separate
chamber
at
and
also
here
she
pretended
it
was
the
custom
of
the
kings
and
queens
of
france
custom
indeed
it
was
your
father
s
custom
and
that
is
easily
understood
as
for
your
grandfather
francois
the
good
man
set
up
the
custom
for
the
convenience
of
his
loves
therefore
i
say
take
care
and
if
we
have
to
leave
this
place
be
sure
that
we
are
not
leave
blois
mary
what
do
you
mean
i
don
t
wish
to
leave
this
beautiful
chateau
where
we
can
see
the
loire
and
the
country
all
round
us
with
a
town
at
our
feet
and
all
these
pretty
gardens
if
i
go
away
it
will
be
to
italy
with
you
to
see
peter
s
and
raffaelle
s
and
the
oh
my
darling
king
if
you
knew
the
longing
your
mary
has
to
ramble
among
the
in
fruit
and
flower
let
us
go
then
cried
the
king
go
exclaimed
the
as
he
entered
the
room
yes
sire
you
must
leave
blois
pardon
my
boldness
in
entering
your
chamber
but
circumstances
are
stronger
than
etiquette
and
i
come
to
entreat
you
to
hold
a
finding
themselves
thus
surprised
mary
and
francois
hastily
separated
and
on
their
faces
was
the
same
expression
of
offended
royal
majesty
you
are
too
much
of
a
monsieur
de
guise
said
the
king
though
controlling
his
anger
the
devil
take
lovers
murmured
the
cardinal
in
catherine
s
ear
my
son
said
the
appearing
behind
the
cardinal
it
is
a
matter
concerning
your
safety
and
that
of
your
heresy
wakes
while
you
have
slept
sire
said
the
cardinal
withdraw
into
the
hall
cried
the
little
king
and
then
we
will
hold
a
madame
said
the
to
the
young
queen
the
son
of
your
furrier
has
brought
some
furs
which
was
just
in
time
for
the
journey
for
it
is
probable
we
shall
sail
down
the
loire
but
he
added
turning
to
the
he
also
wishes
to
speak
to
you
madame
while
the
king
dresses
you
and
madame
la
reine
had
better
see
and
dismiss
him
so
that
we
may
not
be
delayed
and
harassed
by
this
certainly
said
catherine
thinking
to
herself
if
he
expects
to
get
rid
of
me
by
any
such
trick
he
little
knows
the
cardinal
and
the
duke
withdrew
leaving
the
two
queens
and
the
king
alone
together
as
they
crossed
the
des
to
enter
the
the
told
the
usher
to
bring
the
queen
s
furrier
to
him
when
christophe
saw
the
usher
approaching
from
the
farther
end
of
the
great
hall
he
took
him
on
account
of
his
uniform
for
some
great
personage
and
his
heart
sank
within
him
but
that
sensation
natural
as
it
was
at
the
approach
of
the
critical
moment
grew
terrible
when
the
usher
whose
movement
had
attracted
the
eyes
of
all
that
brilliant
assembly
upon
christophe
his
homely
face
and
his
bundles
said
to
him
messeigneurs
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
and
the
wish
to
speak
to
you
in
the
council
can
i
have
been
betrayed
thought
the
helpless
ambassador
of
the
reformers
christophe
followed
the
usher
with
lowered
eyes
which
he
did
not
raise
till
he
stood
in
the
great
the
size
of
which
is
almost
equal
to
that
of
the
des
the
two
lorrain
princes
were
there
alone
standing
before
the
magnificent
fireplace
which
backs
against
that
in
the
des
around
which
the
ladies
of
the
two
queens
were
grouped
you
have
come
from
paris
which
route
did
you
take
said
the
cardinal
i
came
by
water
monseigneur
replied
the
reformer
how
did
you
enter
blois
asked
the
by
the
docks
did
no
one
question
you
exclaimed
the
duke
who
was
watching
the
young
man
closely
no
monseigneur
to
the
first
soldier
who
looked
as
if
he
meant
to
stop
me
i
said
i
came
on
duty
to
the
two
queens
to
whom
my
father
was
what
is
happening
in
paris
asked
the
cardinal
they
are
still
looking
for
the
murderer
of
the
president
are
you
not
the
son
of
my
surgeon
s
greatest
friend
said
the
duc
de
guise
misled
by
the
candor
of
christophe
s
expression
after
his
first
alarm
had
passed
away
yes
the
turned
aside
abruptly
raised
the
portiere
which
concealed
the
double
door
of
the
and
showed
his
face
to
the
whole
assembly
among
whom
he
was
searching
for
the
king
s
surgeon
ambroise
pare
standing
in
a
corner
caught
a
glance
which
the
duke
cast
upon
him
and
immediately
advanced
ambroise
who
at
this
time
was
inclined
to
the
reformed
religion
eventually
adopted
it
but
the
friendship
of
the
guises
and
that
of
the
kings
of
france
guaranteed
him
against
the
evils
which
overtook
his
the
duke
who
considered
himself
under
obligations
for
life
to
ambroise
pare
had
lately
caused
him
to
be
appointed
to
the
king
what
is
it
monseigneur
said
ambroise
is
the
king
ill
i
think
it
likely
why
the
queen
is
too
pretty
replied
the
surgeon
ah
exclaimed
the
duke
in
astonishment
however
that
is
not
the
matter
now
he
added
after
a
pause
ambroise
i
want
you
to
see
a
friend
of
so
saying
he
drew
him
to
the
door
of
the
and
showed
him
christophe
ha
true
monseigneur
cried
the
surgeon
extending
his
hand
to
the
young
furrier
how
is
your
father
my
lad
very
well
maitre
ambroise
replied
christophe
what
are
you
doing
at
court
asked
the
surgeon
it
is
not
your
business
to
carry
parcels
your
father
intends
you
for
the
law
do
you
want
the
protection
of
these
two
great
princes
to
make
you
a
solicitor
indeed
i
do
said
christophe
but
i
am
here
only
in
the
interests
of
my
father
and
if
you
could
intercede
for
us
please
do
so
he
added
in
a
piteous
tone
and
ask
the
grand
master
for
an
order
to
pay
certain
sums
that
are
due
to
my
father
for
he
is
at
his
wit
s
end
just
now
for
the
cardinal
and
the
duke
glanced
at
each
other
and
seemed
satisfied
now
leave
us
said
the
duke
to
the
surgeon
making
him
a
sign
and
you
my
friend
turning
to
christophe
do
your
errand
quickly
and
return
to
paris
my
secretary
will
give
you
a
pass
for
it
is
not
safe
to
be
travelling
on
the
neither
of
the
brothers
formed
the
slightest
suspicion
of
the
grave
importance
of
christophe
s
errand
convinced
as
they
now
were
that
he
was
really
the
son
of
the
good
catholic
lecamus
the
court
furrier
sent
to
collect
payment
for
their
wares
take
him
close
to
the
door
of
the
queen
s
chamber
she
will
probably
ask
for
him
soon
said
the
cardinal
to
the
surgeon
motioning
to
christophe
while
the
son
of
the
furrier
was
undergoing
this
brief
examination
in
the
the
king
leaving
the
queen
in
company
with
her
had
passed
into
his
which
was
entered
through
another
small
room
next
to
the
chamber
standing
in
the
wide
recess
of
an
immense
window
catherine
looked
at
the
gardens
her
mind
a
prey
to
painful
thoughts
she
saw
that
in
all
probability
one
of
the
greatest
captains
of
the
age
would
be
foisted
that
very
day
into
the
place
and
power
of
her
son
the
king
of
france
under
the
formidable
title
of
of
the
kingdom
before
this
peril
she
stood
alone
without
power
of
action
without
defence
she
might
have
been
likened
to
a
phantom
as
she
stood
there
in
her
mourning
garments
which
she
had
not
quitted
since
the
death
of
henri
ii
so
motionless
was
her
pallid
face
in
the
grasp
of
her
bitter
reflections
her
black
eyes
floated
in
that
species
of
indecision
for
which
great
statesmen
are
so
often
blamed
though
it
comes
from
the
vast
extent
of
the
glance
with
which
they
embrace
all
difficulties
setting
one
against
the
other
and
adding
up
as
it
were
all
chances
before
deciding
on
a
course
her
ears
rang
her
blood
tingled
and
yet
she
stood
there
calm
and
dignified
all
the
while
measuring
in
her
soul
the
depths
of
the
political
abyss
which
lay
before
her
like
the
natural
depths
which
rolled
away
at
her
feet
this
day
was
the
second
of
those
terrible
days
that
of
the
arrest
of
the
vidame
of
chartres
being
the
first
which
she
was
destined
to
meet
in
so
great
numbers
throughout
her
regal
life
it
also
witnessed
her
last
blunder
in
the
school
of
power
though
the
sceptre
seemed
escaping
from
her
hands
she
wished
to
seize
it
and
she
did
seize
it
by
a
flash
of
that
power
of
will
which
was
never
relaxed
by
either
the
disdain
of
her
francois
and
his
court
where
in
spite
of
her
rank
of
dauphiness
she
had
been
of
no
account
or
the
constant
repulses
of
her
husband
henri
and
the
terrible
opposition
of
her
rival
diane
de
poitiers
a
man
would
never
have
fathomed
this
thwarted
queen
but
the
mary
so
subtle
so
clever
so
girlish
and
already
so
examined
her
out
of
the
corners
of
her
eyes
as
she
hummed
an
italian
air
and
assumed
a
careless
countenance
without
being
able
to
guess
the
storms
of
repressed
ambition
which
sent
the
dew
of
a
cold
sweat
to
the
forehead
of
the
florentine
the
pretty
scotch
girl
with
her
wilful
piquant
face
knew
very
well
that
the
advancement
of
her
uncle
the
duc
de
guise
to
the
of
the
kingdom
was
filling
the
with
inward
rage
nothing
amused
her
more
than
to
watch
her
in
whom
she
saw
only
an
intriguing
woman
of
low
birth
always
ready
to
avenge
herself
the
face
of
the
one
was
grave
and
gloomy
and
somewhat
terrible
by
reason
of
the
livid
tones
which
transform
the
skin
of
italian
women
to
yellow
ivory
by
daylight
though
it
recovers
its
dazzling
brilliancy
under
candlelight
the
face
of
the
other
was
fair
and
fresh
and
gay
at
sixteen
mary
stuart
s
skin
had
that
exquisite
blond
whiteness
which
made
her
beauty
so
celebrated
her
fresh
and
piquant
face
with
its
pure
lines
shone
with
the
roguish
mischief
of
childhood
expressed
in
the
regular
eyebrows
the
vivacious
eyes
and
the
archness
of
the
pretty
mouth
already
she
displayed
those
feline
graces
which
nothing
not
even
captivity
nor
the
sight
of
her
dreadful
scaffold
could
lessen
the
two
queens
one
at
the
dawn
the
other
in
the
midsummer
of
life
presented
at
this
moment
the
utmost
contrast
catherine
was
an
imposing
queen
an
impenetrable
widow
without
other
passion
than
that
of
power
mary
was
a
careless
bride
making
playthings
of
her
triple
crowns
one
foreboded
great
evils
foreseeing
the
assassination
of
the
guises
as
the
only
means
of
suppressing
enemies
who
were
resolved
to
rise
above
the
throne
and
the
parliament
foreseeing
also
the
bloodshed
of
a
long
and
bitter
struggle
while
the
other
little
anticipated
her
own
judicial
murder
a
sudden
and
strange
reflection
calmed
the
mind
of
the
italian
that
sorceress
and
ruggiero
both
declare
this
reign
is
coming
to
an
end
my
difficulties
will
not
last
long
she
thought
and
so
strangely
enough
an
occult
science
forgotten
in
our
day
that
of
astrology
supported
catherine
at
this
moment
as
it
did
in
fact
throughout
her
life
for
as
she
witnessed
the
minute
fulfilment
of
the
prophecies
of
those
who
practised
the
art
her
belief
in
it
steadily
increased
you
are
very
gloomy
madame
said
mary
stuart
taking
from
the
hands
of
her
dayelle
a
little
cap
and
placing
the
point
of
it
on
the
parting
of
her
hair
while
two
wings
of
rich
lace
surrounded
the
tufts
of
blond
curls
which
clustered
on
her
temples
the
pencil
of
many
painters
have
so
frequently
represented
this
that
it
is
thought
to
have
belonged
exclusively
to
mary
queen
of
scots
whereas
it
was
really
invented
by
catherine
de
medici
when
she
put
on
mourning
for
henri
ii
but
she
never
knew
how
to
wear
it
with
the
grace
of
her
to
whom
it
was
becoming
this
annoyance
was
not
the
least
among
the
many
which
the
cherished
against
the
young
queen
is
the
queen
reproving
me
said
catherine
turning
to
mary
i
owe
you
all
respect
and
should
not
dare
to
do
so
said
the
scottish
queen
maliciously
glancing
at
dayelle
placed
between
the
rival
queens
the
favorite
stood
rigid
as
an
andiron
a
smile
of
comprehension
might
have
cost
her
her
life
can
i
be
as
gay
as
you
after
losing
the
late
king
and
now
beholding
my
son
s
kingdom
about
to
burst
into
flames
public
affairs
do
not
concern
women
said
mary
stuart
besides
my
uncles
are
these
words
were
under
the
circumstances
like
so
many
poisoned
arrows
let
us
look
at
our
furs
madame
replied
the
italian
sarcastically
that
will
employ
us
on
our
legitimate
female
affairs
while
your
uncles
decide
those
of
the
oh
but
we
will
go
the
council
madame
we
shall
be
more
useful
than
you
we
said
catherine
with
an
air
of
astonishment
but
i
do
not
understand
latin
you
think
me
very
learned
cried
mary
stuart
laughing
but
i
assure
you
madame
i
study
only
to
reach
the
level
of
the
medici
and
learn
how
to
the
wounds
of
the
catherine
was
silenced
by
this
sharp
thrust
which
referred
to
the
origin
of
the
medici
who
were
descended
some
said
from
a
doctor
of
medicine
others
from
a
rich
druggist
she
made
no
direct
answer
dayelle
colored
as
her
mistress
looked
at
her
asking
for
the
applause
that
even
queens
demand
from
their
inferiors
if
there
are
no
other
spectators
your
charming
speeches
madame
will
unfortunately
cure
the
wounds
of
neither
church
nor
state
said
catherine
at
last
with
her
calm
and
cold
dignity
the
science
of
my
fathers
in
that
direction
gave
them
thrones
whereas
if
you
continue
to
trifle
in
the
midst
of
danger
you
are
liable
to
lose
it
was
at
this
moment
that
ambroise
pare
the
chief
surgeon
scratched
softly
on
the
door
and
madame
dayelle
opening
it
admitted
christophe
vii
a
drama
in
a
surcoat
the
young
reformer
intended
to
study
catherine
s
face
all
the
while
affecting
a
natural
embarrassment
at
finding
himself
in
such
a
place
but
his
proceedings
were
much
hastened
by
the
eagerness
with
which
the
younger
queen
darted
to
the
cartons
to
see
her
surcoat
madame
said
christophe
addressing
catherine
he
turned
his
back
on
the
other
queen
and
on
dayelle
instantly
profiting
by
the
attention
the
two
women
were
eager
to
bestow
upon
the
furs
to
play
a
bold
stroke
what
do
you
want
of
me
said
catherine
giving
him
a
searching
look
christophe
had
put
the
treaty
proposed
by
the
prince
de
conde
the
plan
of
the
reformers
and
the
detail
of
their
forces
in
his
bosom
between
his
shirt
and
his
cloth
jacket
folding
them
however
within
the
bill
which
catherine
owed
to
the
furrier
madame
he
said
my
father
is
in
horrible
need
of
money
and
if
you
will
deign
to
cast
your
eyes
over
your
bill
here
he
unfolded
the
paper
and
put
the
treaty
on
the
top
of
it
you
will
see
that
your
majesty
owes
him
six
thousand
crowns
have
the
goodness
to
take
pity
on
us
see
madame
and
he
held
the
treaty
out
to
her
read
it
the
account
dates
from
the
time
the
late
king
came
to
the
catherine
was
bewildered
by
the
preamble
of
the
treaty
which
met
her
eye
but
she
did
not
lose
her
head
she
folded
the
paper
quickly
admiring
the
audacity
and
presence
of
mind
of
the
youth
and
feeling
sure
that
after
performing
such
a
masterly
stroke
he
would
not
fail
to
understand
her
she
therefore
tapped
him
on
the
head
with
the
folded
paper
saying
it
is
very
clumsy
of
you
my
little
friend
to
present
your
bill
before
the
furs
learn
to
know
women
you
must
never
ask
us
to
pay
until
the
moment
when
we
are
is
that
traditional
said
the
young
queen
turning
to
her
who
made
no
reply
ah
mesdames
pray
excuse
my
father
said
christophe
if
he
had
not
had
such
need
of
money
you
would
not
have
had
your
furs
at
all
the
country
is
in
arms
and
there
are
so
many
dangers
to
run
in
getting
here
that
nothing
but
our
great
distress
would
have
brought
me
no
one
but
me
was
willing
to
risk
the
lad
is
new
to
his
business
said
mary
stuart
smiling
it
may
not
be
useless
for
the
understanding
of
this
trifling
but
very
important
scene
to
remark
that
a
surcoat
was
as
the
name
implies
a
species
of
spencer
which
women
wore
over
their
bodies
and
down
to
their
thighs
defining
the
figure
this
garment
protected
the
back
chest
and
throat
from
cold
these
surcoats
were
lined
with
fur
a
band
of
which
wide
or
narrow
as
the
case
might
be
bordered
the
outer
material
mary
stuart
as
she
tried
the
garment
on
looked
at
herself
in
a
large
venetian
mirror
to
see
the
effect
behind
thus
leaving
her
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
papers
the
bulk
of
which
might
have
excited
the
young
queen
s
suspicions
had
she
noticed
it
never
tell
women
of
the
dangers
you
have
run
when
you
have
come
out
of
them
safe
and
sound
she
said
turning
to
show
herself
to
christophe
ah
madame
i
have
your
bill
too
he
said
looking
at
her
with
simplicity
the
young
queen
eyed
him
but
did
not
take
the
paper
and
she
noticed
though
without
at
the
moment
drawing
any
conclusions
that
he
had
taken
her
bill
from
his
pocket
whereas
he
had
carried
queen
catherine
s
in
his
bosom
neither
did
she
find
in
the
lad
s
eyes
that
glance
of
admiration
which
her
presence
invariably
excited
in
all
beholders
but
she
was
so
engrossed
by
her
surcoat
that
for
the
moment
she
did
not
ask
herself
the
meaning
of
such
indifference
take
the
bill
dayelle
she
said
to
her
give
it
to
monsieur
de
versailles
lomenie
and
tell
him
from
me
to
pay
oh
madame
said
christophe
if
you
do
not
ask
the
king
or
monseigneur
the
to
sign
me
an
order
your
gracious
word
will
have
no
you
are
rather
more
eager
than
becomes
a
subject
my
friend
said
mary
stuart
do
you
not
believe
my
royal
word
the
king
now
appeared
in
silk
stockings
and
the
breeches
of
that
period
but
without
his
doublet
and
mantle
he
had
however
a
rich
loose
coat
of
velvet
edged
with
minever
who
is
the
wretch
who
dares
to
doubt
your
word
he
said
overhearing
in
spite
of
his
distance
his
wife
s
last
words
the
door
of
the
was
hidden
by
the
royal
bed
this
room
was
afterwards
called
the
old
cabinet
to
distinguish
it
from
the
fine
cabinet
of
pictures
which
henri
iii
constructed
at
the
farther
end
of
the
same
suite
of
rooms
next
to
the
hall
of
the
it
was
in
the
old
cabinet
that
henri
iii
hid
the
murderers
when
he
sent
for
the
duc
de
guise
while
he
himself
remained
hidden
in
the
new
cabinet
during
the
murder
only
emerging
in
time
to
see
the
overbearing
subject
for
whom
there
were
no
longer
prisons
tribunals
judges
nor
even
laws
draw
his
last
breath
were
it
not
for
these
terrible
circumstances
the
historian
of
could
hardly
trace
the
former
occupation
of
these
cabinets
now
filled
with
soldiers

quartermaster

his
mistress

the
very
spot
where

pensive
catherine

decided

her
course

the
parties

with
me
my
friend
said
the
and
i
will
see
that
you
are
paid
commerce
must
live
and
money
is
its
go
my
lad
cried
the
young
queen
laughing
my
august
mother
knows
more
than
i
do
about
catherine
was
about
to
leave
the
room
without
replying
to
this
last
taunt
but
she
remembered
that
her
indifference
to
it
might
provoke
suspicion
and
she
answered
hastily
but
you
my
dear
understand
the
business
of
then
she
descended
to
her
own
apartments
put
away
these
furs
dayelle
and
let
us
go
to
the
council
monsieur
said
mary
to
the
young
king
enchanted
with
the
opportunity
of
deciding
in
the
absence
of
the
so
important
a
question
as
the
of
the
kingdom
mary
stuart
took
the
king
s
arm
dayelle
went
out
before
them
whispering
to
the
pages
one
of
whom
it
was
young
teligny
who
afterwards
perished
so
miserably
during
the
cried
out
the
king
hearing
the
words
the
two
soldiers
of
the
guard
presented
arms
and
the
two
pages
went
forward
to
the
door
of
the
through
the
lane
of
courtiers
and
that
of
the
maids
of
honor
of
the
two
queens
all
the
members
of
the
council
then
grouped
themselves
about
the
door
of
their
chamber
which
was
not
very
far
from
the
door
to
the
staircase
the
the
cardinal
and
the
chancellor
advanced
to
meet
the
young
sovereign
who
smiled
to
several
of
the
maids
of
honor
and
replied
to
the
remarks
of
a
few
courtiers
more
privileged
than
the
rest
but
the
queen
evidently
impatient
drew
francois
ii
as
quickly
as
possible
toward
the
when
the
sound
of
arquebuses
dropping
heavily
on
the
floor
had
announced
the
entrance
of
the
couple
the
pages
replaced
their
caps
upon
their
heads
and
the
private
talk
among
the
courtiers
on
the
gravity
of
the
matters
now
about
to
be
discussed
began
again
they
sent
chiverni
to
fetch
the
connetable
but
he
has
not
come
said
one
there
is
not
a
single
prince
of
the
blood
present
said
another
the
chancellor
and
monsieur
de
tournon
looked
anxious
remarked
a
third
the
sent
word
to
the
keeper
of
the
seals
to
be
sure
not
to
miss
this
council
therefore
you
may
be
certain
they
will
issue
why
does
the
stay
in
her
own
apartments
at
such
a
time
they
ll
cut
out
plenty
of
work
for
us
remarked
groslot
to
cardinal
de
chatillon
in
short
everybody
had
a
word
to
say
some
went
and
came
in
and
out
of
the
great
hall
others
hovered
about
the
maids
of
honor
of
both
queens
as
if
it
might
be
possible
to
catch
a
few
words
through
a
wall
three
feet
thick
or
through
the
double
doors
draped
on
each
side
with
heavy
curtains
seated
at
the
upper
end
of
a
long
table
covered
with
blue
velvet
which
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
king
near
to
whom
the
young
queen
was
seated
in
an
waited
for
his
mother
robertet
the
secretary
was
mending
pens
the
two
cardinals
the
the
chancellor
the
keeper
of
the
seals
and
all
the
rest
of
the
council
looked
at
the
little
king
wondering
why
he
did
not
give
them
the
usual
order
to
sit
down
the
two
lorrain
princes
attributed
the
s
absence
to
some
trick
of
their
niece
incited
presently
by
a
significant
glance
the
audacious
cardinal
said
to
his
majesty
is
it
the
king
s
good
pleasure
to
begin
the
council
without
waiting
for
madame
la
francois
without
daring
to
answer
directly
said
messieurs
be
the
cardinal
then
explained
succinctly
the
dangers
of
the
situation
this
great
political
character
who
showed
extraordinary
ability
under
these
pressing
circumstances
led
up
to
the
question
of
the
lieutenancy
of
the
kingdom
in
the
midst
of
the
deepest
silence
the
young
king
doubtless
felt
the
tyranny
that
was
being
exercised
over
him
he
knew
that
his
mother
had
a
deep
sense
of
the
rights
of
the
crown
and
was
fully
aware
of
the
danger
that
threatened
his
power
he
therefore
replied
to
a
positive
question
addressed
to
him
by
the
cardinal
by
saying
we
will
wait
for
the
queen
my
suddenly
enlightened
by
the
s
delay
mary
stuart
recalled
in
a
flash
of
thought
three
circumstances
which
now
struck
her
vividly
first
the
bulk
of
the
papers
presented
to
her
which
she
had
noticed
absorbed
as
she
was
for
a
woman
who
seems
to
see
nothing
is
often
a
lynx
next
the
place
where
christophe
had
carried
them
to
keep
them
separate
from
hers
why
so
she
thought
to
herself
and
thirdly
she
remembered
the
cold
indifferent
glance
of
the
young
man
which
she
suddenly
attributed
to
the
hatred
of
the
reformers
to
a
niece
of
the
guises
a
voice
cried
to
her
he
may
have
been
an
emissary
of
the
huguenots
obeying
like
all
excitable
natures
her
first
impulse
she
exclaimed
i
will
go
and
fetch
my
mother
myself
then
she
left
the
room
hurriedly
ran
down
the
staircase
to
the
amazement
of
the
courtiers
and
the
ladies
of
honor
entered
her
s
apartments
crossed
the
opened
the
door
of
the
chamber
with
the
caution
of
a
thief
glided
like
a
shadow
over
the
carpet
saw
no
one
and
bethought
her
that
she
should
surely
surprise
the
in
that
magnificent
which
comes
between
the
bedroom
and
the
oratory
the
arrangement
of
this
oratory
to
which
the
manners
of
that
period
gave
a
role
in
private
life
like
that
of
the
boudoirs
of
our
day
can
still
be
traced
by
an
almost
inexplicable
chance
when
we
consider
the
state
of
dilapidation
into
which
the
crown
has
allowed
the
chateau
of
blois
to
fall
the
admirable
woodwork
of
catherine
s
cabinet
still
exists
and
in
those
delicately
carved
panels
persons
interested
in
such
things
may
still
see
traces
of
italian
splendor
and
discover
the
secret
employed
by
the
an
exact
description
of
these
curious
arrangements
is
necessary
in
order
to
give
a
clear
understanding
of
what
was
now
to
happen
the
woodwork
of
the
oratory
then
consisted
of
about
a
hundred
and
eighty
oblong
panels
one
hundred
of
which
still
exist
all
presenting
arabesques
of
different
designs
evidently
suggested
by
the
most
beautiful
arabesques
of
italy
the
wood
is
the
red
tones
seen
through
the
layer
of
whitewash
put
on
to
avert
cholera
useless
precaution
shows
very
plainly
that
the
ground
of
the
panels
was
formerly
gilt
certain
portions
of
the
design
visible
where
the
wash
has
fallen
away
seem
to
show
that
they
once
detached
themselves
from
the
gilded
ground
in
colors
either
blue
or
red
or
green
the
multitude
of
these
panels
shows
an
evident
intention
to
foil
a
search
but
even
if
this
could
be
doubted
the
concierge
of
the
chateau
while
devoting
the
memory
of
catherine
to
the
execration
of
the
humanity
of
our
day
shows
at
the
base
of
these
panels
and
close
to
the
floor
a
rather
heavy
which
can
be
lifted
and
beneath
which
still
remain
the
ingenious
springs
which
move
the
panels
by
pressing
a
knob
thus
hidden
the
queen
was
able
to
open
certain
panels
known
to
her
alone
behind
which
sunk
in
the
wall
were
oblong
like
the
panels
and
more
or
less
deep
it
is
difficult
even
in
these
days
of
dilapidation
for
the
eye
to
detect
which
of
those
panels
is
thus
hinged
but
when
the
eye
was
distracted
by
colors
and
gilding
cleverly
used
to
conceal
the
joints
we
can
readily
conceive
that
to
find
one
or
two
such
panels
among
two
hundred
was
almost
an
impossible
thing
at
the
moment
when
mary
stuart
laid
her
hand
on
the
somewhat
complicated
lock
of
the
door
of
this
oratory
the
who
had
just
become
convinced
of
the
greatness
of
the
prince
de
conde
s
plans
had
touched
the
spring
hidden
beneath
the
and
one
of
the
mysterious
panels
had
turned
over
on
its
hinges
catherine
was
in
the
act
of
lifting
the
papers
from
the
table
to
hide
them
intending
after
that
to
secure
the
safety
of
the
devoted
messenger
who
had
brought
them
to
her
when
hearing
the
sudden
opening
of
the
door
she
at
once
knew
that
none
but
queen
mary
herself
would
dare
thus
to
enter
without
announcement
you
are
lost
she
said
to
christophe
perceiving
that
she
could
no
longer
put
away
the
papers
nor
close
with
sufficient
rapidity
the
open
panel
the
secret
of
which
was
now
betrayed
christophe
answered
her
with
a
glance
that
was
sublime
said
catherine
before
she
looked
at
her
treason
madame
i
hold
the
traitors
at
last
she
cried
send
for
the
duke
and
the
cardinal
and
see
that
that
man
pointing
to
christophe
does
not
in
an
instant
the
able
woman
had
seen
the
necessity
of
sacrificing
the
poor
youth
she
could
not
hide
him
it
was
impossible
to
save
him
eight
days
earlier
it
might
have
been
done
but
the
guises
now
knew
of
the
plot
they
must
already
possess
the
lists
she
held
in
her
hand
and
were
evidently
drawing
the
reformers
into
a
trap
thus
rejoiced
to
find
in
these
adversaries
the
very
spirit
she
desired
them
to
have
her
policy
now
led
her
to
make
a
merit
of
the
discovery
of
their
plot
these
horrible
calculations
were
made
during
the
rapid
moment
while
the
young
queen
was
opening
the
door
mary
stuart
stood
dumb
for
an
instant
the
gay
look
left
her
eyes
which
took
on
the
acuteness
that
suspicion
gives
to
the
eyes
of
all
and
which
in
hers
became
terrible
from
the
suddenness
of
the
change
she
glanced
from
christophe
to
the
and
from
the
back
to
christophe
her
face
expressing
malignant
doubt
then
she
seized
a
bell
at
the
sound
of
which
one
of
the
s
maids
of
honor
came
running
in
mademoiselle
du
rouet
send
for
the
captain
of
the
guard
said
mary
stuart
to
the
maid
of
honor
contrary
to
all
etiquette
which
was
necessarily
violated
under
the
circumstances
while
the
young
queen
gave
this
order
catherine
looked
intently
at
christophe
as
if
saying
to
him
courage
the
reformer
understood
and
replied
by
another
glance
which
seemed
to
say
sacrifice
me
as
have
sacrificed
me
rely
on
me
said
catherine
by
a
gesture
then
she
absorbed
herself
in
the
documents
as
her
turned
to
him
you
belong
to
the
reformed
religion
inquired
mary
stuart
of
christophe
yes
madame
he
answered
i
was
not
mistaken
she
murmured
as
she
again
noticed
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
reformer
the
same
cold
glance
in
which
dislike
was
hidden
beneath
an
expression
of
humility
pardaillan
suddenly
appeared
sent
by
the
two
lorrain
princes
and
by
the
king
to
escort
the
queens
the
captain
of
the
guard
called
for
by
mary
stuart
followed
the
young
officer
who
was
devoted
to
the
guises
go
and
tell
the
king
and
the
and
the
cardinal
from
me
to
come
here
at
once
and
say
that
i
should
not
take
the
liberty
of
sending
for
them
if
something
of
the
utmost
importance
had
not
occurred
go
as
for
you
lewiston
keep
guard
over
that
traitor
of
a
reformer
she
said
to
the
scotchman
in
his
pointing
to
christophe
the
young
queen
and
maintained
a
total
silence
until
the
arrival
of
the
king
and
princes
the
moments
that
elapsed
were
terrible
mary
stuart
had
betrayed
to
her
in
its
fullest
extent
the
part
her
uncles
were
inducing
her
to
play
her
constant
and
habitual
distrust
and
espionage
were
now
revealed
and
her
young
conscience
told
her
how
dishonoring
to
a
great
queen
was
the
work
that
she
was
doing
catherine
on
the
other
hand
had
yielded
out
of
fear
she
was
still
afraid
of
being
rightly
understood
and
she
trembled
for
her
future
both
women
one
ashamed
and
angry
the
other
filled
with
hatred
and
yet
calm
went
to
the
embrasure
of
the
window
and
leaned
against
the
casing
one
to
right
the
other
to
left
silent
but
their
feelings
were
expressed
in
such
speaking
glances
that
they
averted
their
eyes
and
with
mutual
artfulness
gazed
through
the
window
at
the
sky
these
two
great
and
superior
women
had
at
this
crisis
no
greater
art
of
behavior
than
the
vulgarest
of
their
sex
perhaps
it
is
always
thus
when
circumstances
arise
which
overwhelm
the
human
being
there
is
inevitably
a
moment
when
genius
itself
feels
its
littleness
in
presence
of
great
catastrophes
as
for
christophe
he
was
like
a
man
in
the
act
of
rolling
down
a
precipice
lewiston
the
scotch
captain
listened
to
this
silence
watching
the
son
of
the
furrier
and
the
two
queens
with
soldierly
curiosity
the
entrance
of
the
king
and
mary
stuart
s
two
uncles
put
an
end
to
the
painful
situation
viii
martyrdom
the
cardinal
went
straight
to
the
i
hold
the
threads
of
the
conspiracy
of
the
heretics
said
catherine
they
have
sent
me
this
treaty
and
these
documents
by
the
hands
of
that
child
she
added
during
the
time
that
catherine
was
explaining
matters
to
the
cardinal
queen
mary
whispered
a
few
words
to
the
what
is
all
this
about
asked
the
young
king
who
was
left
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
violent
clash
of
interests
the
proofs
of
what
i
was
telling
to
your
majesty
have
not
been
long
in
reaching
us
said
the
cardinal
who
had
grasped
the
papers
the
duc
de
guise
drew
his
brother
aside
without
caring
that
he
interrupted
him
and
said
in
his
ear
this
makes
me
without
a
shrewd
glance
was
the
cardinal
s
only
answer
showing
his
brother
that
he
fully
understood
the
advantages
to
be
gained
from
catherine
s
false
position
who
sent
you
here
said
the
duke
to
christophe
chaudieu
the
minister
he
replied
young
man
you
lie
said
the
soldier
sharply
it
was
the
prince
de
the
prince
de
conde
monseigneur
replied
christophe
with
a
puzzled
look
i
never
met
him
i
am
studying
law
with
monsieur
de
thou
i
am
his
secretary
and
he
does
not
know
that
i
belong
to
the
reformed
religion
i
yielded
only
to
the
entreaties
of
the
enough
exclaimed
the
cardinal
call
monsieur
de
robertet
he
said
to
lewiston
for
this
young
scamp
is
slyer
than
an
old
statesman
he
has
managed
to
deceive
my
brother
and
me
too
an
hour
ago
i
would
have
given
him
the
sacrament
without
you
are
not
a
child
cried
the
duke
and
we
ll
treat
you
as
a
the
heretics
have
attempted
to
beguile
your
august
mother
said
the
cardinal
addressing
the
king
and
trying
to
draw
him
apart
to
win
him
over
to
their
ends
alas
said
the
to
her
son
assuming
a
reproachful
look
and
stopping
the
king
at
the
moment
when
the
cardinal
was
leading
him
into
the
oratory
to
subject
him
to
his
dangerous
eloquence
you
see
the
result
of
the
situation
in
which
i
am
they
think
me
irritated
by
the
little
influence
that
i
have
in
public
affairs
i
the
mother
of
four
princes
of
the
house
of
valois
the
young
king
listened
attentively
mary
stuart
seeing
the
frown
upon
his
brow
took
his
arm
and
led
him
away
into
the
recess
of
the
window
where
she
cajoled
him
with
sweet
speeches
in
a
low
voice
no
doubt
like
those
she
had
used
that
morning
in
their
chamber
the
two
guises
read
the
documents
given
up
to
them
by
catherine
finding
that
they
contained
information
which
their
spies
and
monsieur
braguelonne
the
lieutenant
of
the
chatelet
had
not
obtained
they
were
inclined
to
believe
in
the
sincerity
of
catherine
de
medici
robertet
came
and
received
certain
secret
orders
relative
to
christophe
the
youthful
instrument
of
the
leaders
of
the
reformation
was
then
led
away
by
four
soldiers
of
the
scottish
guard
who
took
him
down
the
stairs
and
delivered
him
to
monsieur
de
montresor
provost
of
the
chateau
that
terrible
personage
himself
accompanied
by
six
of
his
men
conducted
christophe
to
the
prison
in
the
vaulted
cellar
of
the
tower
now
in
ruins
which
the
concierge
of
the
chateau
de
blois
shows
you
with
the
information
that
these
were
the
dungeons
after
such
an
event
the
council
could
be
only
a
formality
the
king
the
young
queen
the
and
the
cardinal
returned
to
it
taking
with
them
the
vanquished
catherine
who
said
no
word
except
to
approve
the
measures
proposed
by
the
guises
in
spite
of
a
slight
opposition
from
the
chancelier
olivier
the
only
person
present
who
said
one
word
that
expressed
the
independence
to
which
his
office
bound
him
the
duc
de
guise
was
appointed
of
the
kingdom
robertet
brought
the
required
documents
showing
a
devotion
which
might
be
called
collusion
the
king
giving
his
arm
to
his
mother
recrossed
the
des
announcing
to
the
court
as
he
passed
along
that
on
the
following
day
he
should
leave
blois
for
the
chateau
of
amboise
the
latter
residence
had
been
abandoned
since
the
time
when
charles
viii
accidentally
killed
himself
by
striking
his
head
against
the
casing
of
a
door
on
which
he
had
ordered
carvings
supposing
that
he
could
enter
without
stooping
below
the
scaffolding
catherine
to
mask
the
plans
of
the
guises
remarked
aloud
that
they
intended
to
complete
the
chateau
of
amboise
for
the
crown
at
the
same
time
that
her
own
chateau
of
chemonceaux
was
finished
but
no
one
was
the
dupe
of
that
pretext
and
all
present
awaited
great
events
after
spending
about
two
hours
endeavoring
to
see
where
he
was
in
the
obscurity
of
the
dungeon
christophe
ended
by
discovering
that
the
place
was
sheathed
in
rough
woodwork
thick
enough
to
make
the
square
hole
into
which
he
was
put
both
healthy
and
habitable
the
door
like
that
of
a
was
so
low
that
he
stooped
almost
double
on
entering
it
beside
this
door
was
a
heavy
iron
grating
opening
upon
a
sort
of
corridor
which
gave
a
little
light
and
a
little
air
this
arrangement
in
all
respects
like
that
of
the
dungeons
of
venice
showed
plainly
that
the
architecture
of
the
chateau
of
blois
belonged
to
the
venetian
school
which
during
the
middle
ages
sent
so
many
builders
into
all
parts
of
europe
by
tapping
this
species
of
pit
above
the
woodwork
christophe
discovered
that
the
walls
which
separated
his
cell
to
right
and
left
from
the
adjoining
ones
were
made
of
brick
striking
one
of
them
to
get
an
idea
of
its
thickness
he
was
somewhat
surprised
to
hear
return
blows
given
on
the
other
side
who
are
you
said
his
neighbor
speaking
to
him
through
the
corridor
i
am
christophe
i
replied
the
voice
am
captain
chaudieu
brother
of
the
minister
i
was
taken
prisoner
at
beaugency
but
luckily
there
is
nothing
against
all
is
discovered
said
christophe
you
are
fortunate
to
be
saved
from
the
we
have
three
thousand
men
at
this
moment
in
the
forests
of
the
vendomois
all
determined
men
who
mean
to
abduct
the
king
and
the
during
their
journey
happily
la
renaudie
was
cleverer
than
i
he
managed
to
escape
you
had
only
just
left
us
when
the
guise
men
surprised
us
but
i
don
t
know
la
pooh
my
brother
has
told
me
all
about
it
said
the
captain
hearing
that
christophe
sat
down
upon
his
bench
and
made
no
further
answer
to
the
pretended
captain
for
he
knew
enough
of
the
police
to
be
aware
how
necessary
it
was
to
act
with
prudence
in
a
prison
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
saw
the
pale
light
of
a
lantern
in
the
corridor
after
hearing
the
ponderous
locks
of
the
iron
door
which
closed
the
cellar
groan
as
they
were
turned
the
provost
himself
had
come
to
fetch
christophe
this
attention
to
a
prisoner
who
had
been
left
in
his
dark
dungeon
for
hours
without
food
struck
the
poor
lad
as
singular
one
of
the
provost
s
men
bound
his
hands
with
a
rope
and
held
him
by
the
end
of
it
until
they
reached
one
of
the
lower
halls
of
the
chateau
of
louis
which
was
evidently
the
antechamber
to
the
apartments
of
some
important
personage
the
provost
and
his
men
bade
him
sit
upon
a
bench
and
the
man
then
bound
his
feet
as
he
had
before
bound
his
hands
on
a
sign
from
monsieur
de
montresor
the
man
left
the
room
now
listen
to
me
my
friend
said
the
toying
with
the
collar
of
the
order
for
late
as
the
hour
was
he
was
in
full
uniform
this
little
circumstance
gave
the
young
man
several
thoughts
he
saw
that
all
was
not
over
on
the
contrary
it
was
evidently
neither
to
hang
nor
yet
to
condemn
him
that
he
was
brought
here
my
friend
you
may
spare
yourself
cruel
torture
by
telling
me
all
you
know
of
the
understanding
between
monsieur
le
prince
de
conde
and
queen
catherine
not
only
will
no
harm
be
done
to
you
but
you
shall
enter
the
service
of
monseigneur
the
of
the
kingdom
who
likes
intelligent
men
and
on
whom
your
honest
face
has
produced
a
good
impression
the
is
about
to
be
sent
back
to
florence
and
monsieur
de
conde
will
no
doubt
be
brought
to
trial
therefore
believe
me
humble
folks
ought
to
attach
themselves
to
the
great
men
who
are
in
power
tell
me
all
and
you
will
find
your
profit
in
alas
monsieur
replied
christophe
i
have
nothing
to
tell
i
told
all
i
know
to
messieurs
de
guise
in
the
queen
s
chamber
chaudieu
persuaded
me
to
put
those
papers
under
the
eyes
of
the
assuring
me
that
they
concerned
the
peace
of
the
you
have
never
seen
the
prince
de
conde
thereupon
monsieur
de
montresor
left
christophe
and
went
into
the
adjoining
room
but
the
youth
was
not
left
long
alone
the
door
through
which
he
had
been
brought
opened
and
gave
entrance
to
several
men
who
did
not
close
it
sounds
that
were
far
from
reassuring
were
heard
from
the
courtyard
men
were
bringing
wood
and
machinery
evidently
intended
for
the
punishment
of
the
reformer
s
messenger
christophe
s
anxiety
soon
had
matter
for
reflection
in
the
preparations
which
were
made
in
the
hall
before
his
eyes
two
coarse
and
obeyed
the
orders
of
a
stout
squat
vigorous
man
who
cast
upon
christophe
as
he
entered
the
glance
of
a
cannibal
upon
his
victim
he
looked
him
over
and
him
measuring
like
a
connoisseur
the
strength
of
his
nerves
their
power
and
their
endurance
the
man
was
the
executioner
of
blois
coming
and
going
his
assistants
brought
in
a
mattress
several
mallets
and
wooden
wedges
also
planks
and
other
articles
the
use
of
which
was
not
plain
nor
their
look
comforting
to
the
poor
boy
concerned
in
these
preparations
whose
blood
now
curdled
in
his
veins
from
a
vague
but
most
terrible
apprehension
two
personages
entered
the
hall
at
the
moment
when
monsieur
de
montresor
reappeared
hey
nothing
ready
cried
the
to
whom
the
bowed
with
great
respect
don
t
you
know
he
said
addressing
the
stout
man
and
his
two
assistants
that
monseigneur
the
cardinal
thinks
you
already
at
work
doctor
added
the
provost
turning
to
one
of
the
this
is
the
man
and
he
pointed
to
christophe
the
doctor
went
straight
to
the
prisoner
unbound
his
hands
and
struck
him
on
the
breast
and
back
science
now
continued
in
a
serious
manner
the
truculent
examination
of
the
executioner
s
eye
during
this
time
a
servant
in
the
livery
of
the
house
of
guise
brought
in
several
a
table
and
begin
the
said
monsieur
de
montresor
motioning
to
the
table
the
second
personage
who
was
dressed
in
black
and
was
evidently
a
clerk
then
the
provost
went
up
to
christophe
and
said
to
him
in
a
very
gentle
way
my
friend
the
chancellor
having
learned
that
you
refuse
to
answer
me
in
a
satisfactory
manner
decrees
that
you
be
put
to
the
question
ordinary
and
is
he
in
good
health
and
can
he
bear
it
said
the
clerk
to
the
doctor
yes
replied
the
latter
who
was
one
of
the
physicians
of
the
house
of
lorraine
in
that
case
retire
to
the
next
room
we
will
send
for
you
whenever
we
require
your
the
physician
left
the
hall
his
first
terror
having
passed
christophe
rallied
his
courage
the
hour
of
his
martyrdom
had
come
thenceforth
he
looked
with
cold
curiosity
at
the
arrangements
that
were
made
by
the
executioner
and
his
men
after
hastily
preparing
a
bed
the
two
assistants
got
ready
certain
appliances
called
which
consisted
of
several
planks
between
which
each
leg
of
the
victim
was
placed
the
legs
thus
placed
were
brought
close
together
the
apparatus
used
by
binders
to
press
their
volumes
between
two
boards
which
they
fasten
by
cords
will
give
an
exact
idea
of
the
manner
in
which
each
leg
of
the
prisoner
was
bound
we
can
imagine
the
effect
produced
by
the
insertion
of
wooden
wedges
driven
in
by
hammers
between
the
planks
of
the
two
bound
legs
the
two
sets
of
planks
of
course
not
yielding
being
themselves
bound
together
by
ropes
these
wedges
were
driven
in
on
a
line
with
the
knees
and
the
ankles
the
choice
of
these
places
where
there
is
little
flesh
and
where
consequently
the
wedge
could
only
be
forced
in
by
crushing
the
bones
made
this
form
of
torture
called
the
question
horribly
painful
in
the
ordinary
question
four
wedges
were
driven
in
two
at
the
knees
two
at
the
ankles
but
in
the
extraordinary
question
the
number
was
increased
to
eight
provided
the
doctor
certified
that
the
prisoner
s
vitality
was
not
exhausted
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
the
boots
were
also
applied
in
the
same
manner
to
the
hands
and
wrists
but
being
pressed
for
time
the
cardinal
the
and
the
chancellor
spared
christophe
that
additional
suffering
the
was
begun
the
provost
dictated
a
few
sentences
as
he
walked
up
and
down
with
a
meditative
air
asking
christophe
his
name
baptismal
name
age
and
profession
then
he
inquired
the
name
of
the
person
from
whom
he
had
received
the
papers
he
had
given
to
the
queen
from
the
minister
chaudieu
answered
christophe
where
did
he
give
them
to
you
in
in
giving
them
to
you
he
must
have
told
you
whether
the
would
receive
you
with
pleasure
he
told
me
nothing
of
that
kind
said
christophe
he
merely
asked
me
to
give
them
to
queen
catherine
you
must
have
seen
chaudieu
frequently
or
he
would
not
have
known
that
you
were
going
to
the
minister
did
not
know
from
me
that
in
carrying
furs
to
the
queen
i
was
also
to
ask
on
my
father
s
behalf
for
the
money
the
owes
him
and
i
did
not
have
time
to
ask
the
minister
who
had
told
him
of
but
these
papers
which
were
given
to
you
without
being
sealed
or
enveloped
contained
a
treaty
between
the
rebels
and
queen
catherine
you
must
have
seen
that
they
exposed
you
to
the
punishment
of
all
those
who
assist
in
a
the
persons
who
persuaded
you
to
this
act
of
high
treason
must
have
promised
you
rewards
and
the
protection
of
the
i
did
it
out
of
attachment
to
chaudieu
the
only
person
whom
i
saw
in
the
do
you
persist
in
saying
you
did
not
see
the
prince
de
conde
the
prince
de
conde
did
not
tell
you
that
the
was
inclined
to
enter
into
his
views
against
the
messieurs
de
guise
i
did
not
see
take
care
one
of
your
accomplices
la
renaudie
has
been
arrested
strong
as
he
is
he
was
not
able
to
bear
the
question
which
will
now
be
put
to
you
he
confessed
at
last
that
both
he
and
the
prince
de
conde
had
an
interview
with
you
if
you
wish
to
escape
the
torture
of
the
question
i
exhort
you
to
tell
me
the
simple
truth
perhaps
you
will
thus
obtain
your
full
christophe
answered
that
he
could
not
state
a
thing
of
which
he
had
no
knowledge
or
give
himself
accomplices
when
he
had
none
hearing
these
words
the
signed
to
the
executioner
and
retired
himself
to
the
inner
room
at
that
fatal
sign
christophe
s
brows
contracted
his
forehead
worked
with
nervous
convulsion
as
he
prepared
himself
to
suffer
his
hands
closed
with
such
violence
that
the
nails
entered
the
flesh
without
his
feeling
them
three
men
seized
him
took
him
to
the
camp
bed
and
laid
him
there
letting
his
legs
hang
down
while
the
executioner
fastened
him
to
the
rough
bedstead
with
strong
cords
the
assistants
bound
his
legs
into
the
presently
the
cords
were
tightened
by
means
of
a
wrench
without
the
pressure
causing
much
pain
to
the
young
reformer
when
each
leg
was
thus
held
as
it
were
in
a
vice
the
executioner
grasped
his
hammer
and
picked
up
the
wedges
looking
alternately
at
the
victim
and
at
the
clerk
do
you
persist
in
your
denial
asked
the
clerk
i
have
told
the
truth
replied
christophe
very
well
go
on
said
the
clerk
closing
his
eyes
the
cords
were
tightened
with
great
force
this
was
perhaps
the
most
painful
moment
of
the
torture
the
flesh
being
suddenly
compressed
the
blood
rushed
violently
toward
the
breast
the
poor
boy
could
not
restrain
a
dreadful
cry
and
seemed
about
to
faint
the
doctor
was
called
in
after
feeling
christophe
s
pulse
he
told
the
executioner
to
wait
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
driving
the
first
wedge
in
to
let
the
action
of
the
blood
subside
and
allow
the
victim
to
recover
his
full
sensitiveness
the
clerk
suggested
kindly
that
if
he
could
not
bear
this
beginning
of
sufferings
which
he
could
not
escape
it
would
be
better
to
reveal
all
at
once
but
christophe
made
no
reply
except
to
say
the
king
s
tailor
the
king
s
tailor
what
do
you
mean
by
those
words
asked
the
clerk
seeing
what
torture
i
must
bear
said
christophe
slowly
hoping
to
gain
time
to
rest
i
call
up
all
my
strength
and
try
to
increase
it
by
thinking
of
the
martyrdom
borne
by
the
king
s
tailor
for
the
holy
cause
of
the
reformation
when
the
question
was
applied
to
him
in
presence
of
madame
la
duchesse
de
valentinois
and
the
king
i
shall
try
to
be
worthy
of
while
the
physician
exhorted
the
unfortunate
lad
not
to
force
them
to
have
recourse
to
more
violent
measures
the
cardinal
and
the
duke
impatient
to
know
the
result
of
the
interrogations
entered
the
hall
and
themselves
asked
christophe
to
speak
the
truth
immediately
the
young
man
repeated
the
only
confession
he
had
allowed
himself
to
make
which
implicated
no
one
but
chaudieu
the
princes
made
a
sign
on
which
the
executioner
and
his
assistant
seized
their
hammers
taking
each
a
wedge
which
then
they
drove
in
between
the
joints
standing
one
to
right
the
other
to
left
of
their
victim
the
executioner
s
wedge
was
driven
in
at
the
knees
his
assistant
s
at
the
ankles
the
eyes
of
all
present
fastened
on
those
of
christophe
and
he
no
doubt
excited
by
the
presence
of
those
great
personages
shot
forth
such
burning
glances
that
they
appeared
to
have
all
the
brilliancy
of
flame
as
the
third
and
fourth
wedges
were
driven
in
a
dreadful
groan
escaped
him
when
he
saw
the
executioner
take
up
the
wedges
for
the
extraordinary
question
he
said
no
word
and
made
no
sound
but
his
eyes
took
on
so
terrible
a
fixity
and
he
cast
upon
the
two
great
princes
who
were
watching
him
a
glance
so
penetrating
that
the
duke
and
cardinal
were
forced
to
drop
their
eyes
philippe
le
bel
met
with
the
same
resistance
when
the
torture
of
the
pendulum
was
applied
in
his
presence
to
the
templars
that
punishment
consisted
in
striking
the
victim
on
the
breast
with
one
arm
of
the
balance
pole
with
which
money
is
coined
its
end
being
covered
with
a
pad
of
leather
one
of
the
knights
thus
tortured
looked
so
intently
at
the
king
that
philippe
could
not
detach
his
eyes
from
him
at
the
third
blow
the
king
left
the
chamber
on
hearing
the
knight
summon
him
to
appear
within
a
year
before
the
of
god
as
in
fact
he
did
at
the
fifth
blow
the
first
of
the
extraordinary
question
christophe
said
to
the
cardinal
monseigneur
put
an
end
to
my
torture
it
is
the
cardinal
and
the
duke
the
adjoining
hall
and
christophe
distinctly
heard
the
following
words
said
by
queen
catherine
go
on
after
all
he
is
only
a
she
judged
it
prudent
to
be
more
stern
to
her
accomplice
than
the
executioners
themselves
the
sixth
and
seventh
wedges
were
driven
in
without
a
word
of
complaint
from
christophe
his
face
shone
with
extraordinary
brilliancy
due
no
doubt
to
the
excess
of
strength
which
his
fanatic
devotion
gave
him
where
else
but
in
the
feelings
of
the
soul
can
we
find
the
power
necessary
to
bear
such
sufferings
finally
he
smiled
when
he
saw
the
executioner
lifting
the
eighth
and
last
wedge
this
horrible
torture
had
lasted
by
this
time
over
an
hour
the
clerk
now
went
to
call
the
physician
that
he
might
decide
whether
the
eighth
wedge
could
be
driven
in
without
endangering
the
life
of
the
victim
during
this
delay
the
duke
returned
to
look
at
christophe
you
are
a
fine
fellow
he
said
to
him
bending
down
to
whisper
the
words
i
love
brave
men
enter
my
service
and
you
shall
be
rich
and
happy
my
favors
shall
heal
those
wounded
limbs
i
do
not
propose
to
you
any
baseness
i
will
not
ask
you
to
return
to
your
party
and
betray
its
plans
there
are
always
traitors
enough
for
that
and
the
proof
is
in
the
prisons
of
blois
tell
me
only
on
what
terms
are
the
and
the
prince
de
conde
i
know
nothing
about
it
monseigneur
replied
christophe
lecamus
the
physician
came
examined
the
victim
and
said
that
he
could
bear
the
eighth
wedge
then
insert
it
said
the
cardinal
after
all
as
the
queen
says
he
is
only
a
heretic
he
added
looking
at
christophe
with
a
dreadful
smile
at
this
moment
catherine
came
with
slow
steps
from
the
adjoining
apartment
and
stood
before
christophe
coldly
observing
him
instantly
she
was
the
object
of
the
closest
attention
on
the
part
of
the
two
brothers
who
watched
alternately
the
queen
and
her
accomplice
on
this
solemn
test
the
whole
future
of
that
ambitious
woman
depended
she
felt
the
keenest
admiration
for
christophe
yet
she
gazed
sternly
at
him
she
hated
the
guises
and
she
smiled
upon
them
young
man
said
the
queen
confess
that
you
have
seen
the
prince
de
conde
and
you
will
be
richly
ah
what
a
business
this
is
for
you
madame
cried
christophe
pitying
her
the
queen
quivered
he
insults
me
she
exclaimed
why
do
you
not
hang
him
she
cried
turning
to
the
two
brothers
who
stood
thoughtful
what
a
woman
said
the
duke
in
a
glance
at
his
brother
consulting
him
by
his
eye
and
leading
him
to
the
window
i
shall
stay
in
france
and
be
revenged
upon
them
thought
the
queen
come
make
him
confess
or
let
him
die
she
said
aloud
addressing
montresor
the
turned
away
his
eyes
the
executioners
were
busy
with
the
wedges
catherine
was
free
to
cast
one
glance
upon
the
martyr
unseen
by
others
which
fell
on
christophe
like
the
dew
the
eyes
of
the
great
queen
seemed
to
him
moist
two
tears
were
in
them
but
they
did
not
fall
the
wedges
were
driven
a
plank
was
broken
by
the
blow
christophe
gave
one
dreadful
cry
after
which
he
was
silent
his
face
shone
he
believed
he
was
dying
let
him
die
said
the
cardinal
echoing
the
queen
s
last
words
with
a
sort
of
irony
no
no
don
t
break
that
thread
he
said
to
the
provost
the
duke
and
the
cardinal
consulted
together
in
a
low
voice
what
is
to
be
done
with
him
asked
the
executioner
send
him
to
the
prison
at
orleans
said
the
duke
addressing
monsieur
de
montresor
and
don
t
hang
him
without
my
the
extreme
sensitiveness
to
which
christophe
s
internal
organism
had
been
brought
increased
by
a
resistance
which
called
into
play
every
power
of
the
human
body
existed
to
the
same
degree
in
his
senses
he
alone
heard
the
following
words
whispered
by
the
duc
de
guise
in
the
ear
of
his
brother
the
cardinal
i
don
t
give
up
all
hope
of
getting
the
truth
out
of
that
little
fellow
when
the
princes
had
left
the
hall
the
executioners
unbound
the
legs
of
their
victim
roughly
and
without
compassion
did
any
one
ever
see
a
criminal
with
such
strength
said
the
chief
executioner
to
his
aids
the
rascal
bore
that
last
wedge
when
he
ought
to
have
died
i
ve
lost
the
price
of
his
unbind
me
gently
don
t
make
me
suffer
friends
said
poor
christophe
some
day
i
will
reward
you
come
come
show
some
humanity
said
the
physician
monseigneur
esteems
the
young
man
and
told
me
to
look
after
i
am
going
to
amboise
with
my
assistants
take
care
of
him
yourself
said
the
executioner
brutally
besides
here
comes
the
the
executioner
departed
leaving
christophe
in
the
hands
of
the
doctor
who
by
the
aid
of
christophe
s
future
jailer
carried
the
poor
boy
to
a
bed
brought
him
some
broth
helped
him
to
swallow
it
sat
down
beside
him
felt
his
pulse
and
tried
to
comfort
him
you
won
t
die
of
this
he
said
you
ought
to
feel
great
inward
comfort
knowing
that
you
have
done
your
the
bids
me
take
care
of
you
he
added
in
a
whisper
the
queen
is
very
good
said
christophe
whose
terrible
sufferings
had
developed
an
extraordinary
lucidity
in
his
mind
and
who
after
enduring
such
unspeakable
sufferings
was
determined
not
to
compromise
the
results
of
his
devotion
but
she
might
have
spared
me
much
agony
be
telling
my
persecutors
herself
the
secrets
that
i
know
nothing
about
instead
of
urging
them
hearing
that
reply
the
doctor
took
his
cap
and
cloak
and
left
christophe
rightly
judging
that
he
could
worm
nothing
out
of
a
man
of
that
stamp
the
jailer
of
blois
now
ordered
the
poor
lad
to
be
carried
away
on
a
stretcher
by
four
men
who
took
him
to
the
prison
in
the
town
where
christophe
immediately
fell
into
the
deep
sleep
which
they
say
comes
to
most
mothers
after
the
terrible
pangs
of
childbirth
ix
the
tumult
at
amboise
by
moving
the
court
to
the
chateau
of
amboise
the
two
lorrain
princes
intended
to
set
a
trap
for
the
leader
of
the
party
of
the
reformation
the
prince
de
conde
whom
they
had
made
the
king
summon
to
his
presence
as
vassal
of
the
crown
and
prince
of
the
blood
conde
was
bound
to
obey
the
summons
of
his
sovereign
not
to
come
to
amboise
would
constitute
the
crime
of
treason
but
if
he
came
he
put
himself
in
the
power
of
the
crown
now
at
this
moment
as
we
have
seen
the
crown
the
council
the
court
and
all
their
powers
were
solely
in
the
hands
of
the
duc
de
guise
and
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
the
prince
de
conde
showed
at
this
delicate
crisis
a
presence
of
mind
and
a
decision
and
willingness
which
made
him
the
worthy
exponent
of
jeanne
d
albret
and
the
valorous
general
of
the
reformers
he
travelled
at
the
rear
of
the
conspirators
as
far
as
vendome
intending
to
support
them
in
case
of
their
success
when
the
first
uprising
ended
by
a
brief
skirmish
in
which
the
flower
of
the
nobility
beguiled
by
calvin
perished
the
prince
arrived
with
fifty
noblemen
at
the
chateau
of
amboise
on
the
very
day
after
that
fight
which
the
politic
guises
termed
the
tumult
of
as
soon
as
the
duke
and
cardinal
heard
of
his
coming
they
sent
the
marechal
de
with
an
escort
of
a
hundred
men
to
meet
him
when
the
prince
and
his
own
escort
reached
the
gates
of
the
chateau
the
marechal
refused
entrance
to
the
latter
you
must
enter
alone
monseigneur
said
the
chancellor
olivier
the
cardinal
de
tournon
and
birago
who
were
stationed
outside
of
the
portcullis
and
why
you
are
suspected
of
treason
replied
the
chancellor
the
prince
who
saw
that
his
suite
were
already
surrounded
by
the
troop
of
the
duc
de
nemours
replied
tranquilly
if
that
is
so
i
will
go
alone
to
my
cousin
and
prove
to
him
my
he
dismounted
talked
with
perfect
freedom
of
mind
to
birago
the
cardinal
de
tournon
the
chancellor
and
the
duc
de
nemours
from
whom
he
asked
for
particulars
of
the
monseigneur
replied
the
duke
the
rebels
had
confederates
in
amboise
a
captain
named
lanoue
had
introduced
armed
men
who
opened
the
gate
to
them
through
which
they
entered
and
made
themselves
masters
of
the
town
that
is
to
say
you
opened
the
mouth
of
a
sack
and
they
ran
into
it
replied
the
prince
looking
at
birago
if
they
had
been
supported
by
the
attack
which
captain
chaudieu
the
preacher
s
brother
was
expected
to
make
before
the
gate
of
the
they
would
have
been
completely
successful
replied
the
duc
de
nemours
but
in
consequence
of
the
position
which
the
duc
de
guise
ordered
me
to
take
up
captain
chaudieu
was
obliged
to
turn
my
flank
to
avoid
a
fight
so
instead
of
arriving
by
night
like
the
rest
this
rebel
and
his
men
got
there
at
daybreak
by
which
time
the
king
s
troops
had
crushed
the
invaders
of
the
and
you
had
a
reserve
force
to
recover
the
gate
which
had
been
opened
to
them
said
the
prince
monsieur
le
marechal
de
was
there
with
five
hundred
the
prince
gave
the
highest
praise
to
these
military
arrangements
the
must
have
been
fully
aware
of
the
plans
of
the
reformers
to
have
acted
as
he
did
he
said
in
conclusion
they
were
no
doubt
the
prince
was
treated
with
increasing
harshness
after
separating
him
from
his
escort
at
the
gates
the
cardinal
and
the
chancellor
barred
his
way
when
he
reached
the
staircase
which
led
to
the
apartments
of
the
king
we
are
directed
by
his
majesty
monseigneur
to
take
you
to
your
own
apartments
they
said
am
i
then
a
prisoner
if
that
were
the
king
s
intention
you
would
not
be
accompanied
by
a
prince
of
the
church
nor
by
me
replied
the
chancellor
these
two
personages
escorted
the
prince
to
an
apartment
where
guards
of
honor
were
given
him
there
he
remained
without
seeing
any
one
for
some
hours
from
his
window
he
looked
down
upon
the
loire
and
the
meadows
of
the
beautiful
valley
stretching
from
amboise
to
tours
he
was
reflecting
on
the
situation
and
asking
himself
whether
the
guises
would
really
dare
anything
against
his
person
when
the
door
of
his
chamber
opened
and
chicot
the
king
s
fool
formerly
a
dependent
of
his
own
entered
the
room
they
told
me
you
were
in
disgrace
said
the
prince
you
d
never
believe
how
virtuous
the
court
has
become
since
the
death
of
henri
but
the
king
loves
a
which
king
francois
or
francois
de
lorraine
you
are
not
afraid
of
the
duke
if
you
talk
in
that
way
he
wouldn
t
punish
me
for
it
monseigneur
replied
chicot
laughing
to
what
do
i
owe
the
honor
of
this
visit
hey
isn
t
it
due
to
you
on
your
return
i
bring
you
my
cap
and
can
i
go
out
suppose
i
do
go
out
what
then
i
should
say
that
you
had
won
the
game
by
playing
against
the
chicot
you
alarm
me
are
you
sent
here
by
some
one
who
takes
an
interest
in
me
yes
said
chicot
nodding
he
came
nearer
to
the
prince
and
made
him
understand
that
they
were
being
watched
and
overheard
what
have
you
to
say
to
me
asked
the
prince
de
conde
in
a
low
voice
boldness
alone
can
pull
you
out
of
this
scrape
the
message
comes
from
the
replied
the
fool
slipping
his
words
into
the
ear
of
the
prince
tell
those
who
sent
you
replied
conde
that
i
should
not
have
entered
this
chateau
if
i
had
anything
to
reproach
myself
with
or
to
i
rush
to
report
that
lofty
answer
cried
the
fool
two
hours
later
that
is
about
one
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
before
the
king
s
dinner
the
chancellor
and
cardinal
de
tournon
came
to
fetch
the
prince
and
present
him
to
francois
ii
in
the
great
gallery
of
the
chateau
of
amboise
where
the
councils
were
held
there
before
the
whole
court
conde
pretended
surprise
at
the
coldness
with
which
the
little
king
received
him
and
asked
the
reason
of
it
you
are
accused
cousin
said
the
sternly
of
taking
part
in
the
conspiracy
of
the
reformers
and
you
must
prove
yourself
a
faithful
subject
and
a
good
catholic
if
you
do
not
desire
to
draw
down
upon
your
house
the
anger
of
the
hearing
these
words
said
in
the
midst
of
the
most
profound
silence
by
catherine
de
medici
on
whose
right
arm
the
king
was
leaning
the
duc
d
orleans
being
on
her
left
side
the
prince
de
conde
recoiled
three
steps
laid
his
hand
on
his
sword
with
a
proud
motion
and
looked
at
all
the
persons
who
surrounded
him
those
who
said
that
madame
he
cried
in
an
angry
voice
lied
in
their
throats
then
he
flung
his
glove
at
the
king
s
feet
saying
let
him
who
believes
that
calumny
come
forward
the
whole
court
trembled
as
the
duc
de
guise
was
seen
to
leave
his
place
but
instead
of
picking
up
the
glove
he
advanced
to
the
intrepid
hunchback
if
you
desire
a
second
in
that
duel
monseigneur
do
me
the
honor
to
accept
my
services
he
said
i
will
answer
for
you
i
know
that
you
will
show
the
reformers
how
mistaken
they
are
if
they
think
to
have
you
for
their
the
prince
was
forced
to
take
the
hand
of
the
of
the
kingdom
chicot
picked
up
the
glove
and
returned
it
to
monsieur
de
conde
cousin
said
the
little
king
you
must
draw
your
sword
only
for
the
defence
of
the
kingdom
come
and
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
surprised
at
his
brother
s
action
drew
him
away
to
his
own
apartments
the
prince
de
conde
having
escaped
his
apparent
danger
offered
his
hand
to
mary
stuart
to
lead
her
to
the
dining
hall
but
all
the
while
that
he
made
her
flattering
speeches
he
pondered
in
his
mind
what
trap
the
astute
balafre
was
setting
for
him
in
vain
he
worked
his
brains
for
it
was
not
until
queen
mary
herself
betrayed
it
that
he
guessed
the
intention
of
the
guises
twould
have
been
a
great
pity
she
said
laughing
if
so
clever
a
head
had
fallen
you
must
admit
that
my
uncle
has
been
yes
madame
for
my
head
is
only
useful
on
my
shoulders
though
one
of
them
is
notoriously
higher
than
the
other
but
is
this
really
your
uncle
s
generosity
is
he
not
getting
the
credit
of
it
rather
cheaply
do
you
think
it
would
be
so
easy
to
take
off
the
head
of
a
prince
of
the
blood
all
is
not
over
yet
she
said
we
shall
see
what
your
conduct
will
be
at
the
execution
of
the
noblemen
your
friends
at
which
the
council
has
decided
to
make
a
great
public
display
of
i
shall
do
said
the
prince
whatever
the
king
the
king
the
and
myself
will
be
present
at
the
execution
together
with
the
whole
court
and
the
ambassadors
a
fete
said
the
prince
sarcastically
better
than
that
said
the
young
queen
an
of
an
act
of
the
highest
policy
tis
a
question
of
forcing
the
noblemen
of
france
to
submit
themselves
to
the
crown
and
compelling
them
to
give
up
their
tastes
for
plots
and
factions
you
will
not
break
their
belligerent
tempers
by
the
show
of
danger
madame
you
will
risk
the
crown
itself
in
the
attempt
replied
the
prince
at
the
end
of
the
dinner
which
was
gloomy
enough
queen
mary
had
the
cruel
boldness
to
turn
the
conversation
openly
upon
the
trial
of
the
noblemen
on
the
charge
of
being
seized
with
arms
in
their
hands
and
to
speak
of
the
necessity
of
making
a
great
public
show
of
their
execution
madame
said
francois
is
it
not
enough
for
the
king
of
france
to
know
that
so
much
brave
blood
is
to
flow
must
he
make
a
triumph
of
it
no
sire
but
an
example
replied
catherine
it
was
the
custom
of
your
father
and
your
grandfather
to
be
present
at
the
burning
of
heretics
said
mary
stuart
the
kings
who
reigned
before
me
did
as
they
thought
best
and
i
choose
to
do
as
i
please
said
the
little
king
philip
the
second
remarked
catherine
who
is
certainly
a
great
king
lately
postponed
an
da
until
he
could
return
from
the
low
countries
to
what
do
you
think
cousin
said
the
king
to
prince
de
conde
sire
you
can
not
avoid
it
and
the
papal
nuncio
and
all
the
ambassadors
should
be
present
i
shall
go
willingly
as
these
ladies
take
part
in
the
thus
the
prince
de
conde
at
a
glance
from
catherine
de
medici
bravely
chose
his
course
at
the
moment
when
the
prince
de
conde
was
entering
the
chateau
d
amboise
lecamus
the
furrier
of
the
two
queens
was
also
arriving
from
paris
brought
to
amboise
by
the
anxiety
into
which
the
news
of
the
tumult
had
thrown
both
his
family
and
that
of
lallier
when
the
old
man
presented
himself
at
the
gate
of
the
chateau
the
captain
of
the
guard
on
hearing
that
he
was
the
queens
furrier
said
my
good
man
if
you
want
to
be
hanged
you
have
only
to
set
foot
in
this
hearing
these
words
the
father
in
despair
sat
down
on
a
stone
at
a
little
distance
and
waited
until
some
retainer
of
the
two
queens
or
some
might
pass
who
would
give
him
news
of
his
son
but
he
sat
there
all
day
without
seeing
any
one
whom
he
knew
and
was
forced
at
last
to
go
down
into
the
town
where
he
found
not
without
some
difficulty
a
lodging
in
a
hostelry
on
the
public
square
where
the
executions
took
place
he
was
obliged
to
pay
a
pound
a
day
to
obtain
a
room
with
a
window
looking
on
the
square
the
next
day
he
had
the
courage
to
watch
from
his
window
the
execution
of
all
the
abettors
of
the
rebellion
who
were
condemned
to
be
broken
on
the
wheel
or
hanged
as
persons
of
little
importance
he
was
happy
indeed
not
to
see
his
own
son
among
the
victims
when
the
execution
was
over
he
went
into
the
square
and
put
himself
in
the
way
of
the
clerk
of
the
court
after
giving
his
name
and
slipping
a
purse
full
of
crowns
into
the
man
s
hand
he
begged
him
to
look
on
the
records
and
see
if
the
name
of
christophe
lecamus
appeared
in
either
of
the
three
preceding
executions
the
clerk
touched
by
the
manner
and
the
tones
of
the
despairing
father
took
him
to
his
own
house
after
a
careful
search
he
was
able
to
give
the
old
man
an
absolute
assurance
that
christophe
was
not
among
the
persons
thus
far
executed
nor
among
those
who
were
to
be
put
to
death
within
a
few
days
my
dear
man
said
the
clerk
parliament
has
taken
charge
of
the
trial
of
the
great
lords
implicated
in
the
affair
and
also
that
of
the
principal
leaders
perhaps
your
son
is
detained
in
the
prisons
of
the
chateau
and
he
may
be
brought
forth
for
the
magnificent
execution
which
their
excellencies
the
duc
de
guise
and
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
are
now
preparing
the
heads
of
barons
eleven
counts
and
seven
marquises
in
all
fifty
noblemen
or
leaders
of
the
reformers
are
to
be
cut
off
as
the
justiciary
of
the
county
of
tourine
is
quite
distinct
from
that
of
the
parliament
of
paris
if
you
are
determined
to
know
about
your
son
i
advise
you
to
go
and
see
the
chancelier
olivier
who
has
the
management
of
this
great
trial
under
orders
from
the
of
the
the
poor
old
man
acting
on
this
advice
went
three
times
to
see
the
chancellor
standing
in
a
long
queue
of
persons
waiting
to
ask
mercy
for
their
friends
but
as
the
titled
men
were
made
to
pass
before
the
burghers
he
was
obliged
to
give
up
the
hope
of
speaking
to
the
chancellor
though
he
saw
him
several
times
leave
the
house
to
go
either
to
the
chateau
or
to
the
committee
appointed
by
the
parliament
passing
each
time
between
a
double
hedge
of
petitioners
who
were
kept
back
by
the
guards
to
allow
him
free
passage
it
was
a
horrible
scene
of
anguish
and
desolation
for
among
these
petitioners
were
many
women
wives
mothers
daughters
whole
families
in
distress
old
lecamus
gave
much
gold
to
the
footmen
of
the
chateau
entreating
them
to
put
certain
letters
which
he
wrote
into
the
hand
either
of
dayelle
queen
mary
s
woman
or
into
that
of
the
but
the
footmen
took
the
poor
man
s
money
and
carried
the
letters
according
to
the
general
order
of
the
cardinal
to
the
by
displaying
such
cruelty
the
guises
knew
that
they
incurred
great
dangers
from
revenge
and
never
did
they
take
such
precautions
for
their
safety
as
they
did
while
the
court
was
at
amboise
consequently
neither
the
greatest
of
all
corrupters
gold
nor
the
incessant
and
active
search
which
the
old
furrier
instituted
gave
him
the
slightest
gleam
of
light
on
the
fate
of
his
son
he
went
about
the
little
town
with
a
mournful
air
watching
the
great
preparations
made
by
order
of
the
cardinal
for
the
dreadful
show
at
which
the
prince
de
conde
had
agreed
to
be
present
public
curiosity
was
stimulated
from
paris
to
nantes
by
the
means
adopted
on
this
occasion
the
execution
was
announced
from
all
pulpits
by
the
rectors
of
the
churches
while
at
the
same
time
they
gave
thanks
for
the
victory
of
the
king
over
the
heretics
three
handsome
balconies
the
middle
one
more
sumptuous
than
the
other
two
were
built
against
the
terrace
of
the
chateau
of
amboise
at
the
foot
of
which
the
executions
were
appointed
to
take
place
around
the
open
square
stagings
were
erected
and
these
were
filled
with
an
immense
crowd
of
people
attracted
by
the
notoriety
given
to
this
act
of
ten
thousand
persons
camped
in
the
adjoining
fields
the
night
before
the
day
on
which
the
horrible
spectacle
was
appointed
to
take
place
the
roofs
on
the
houses
were
crowded
with
spectators
and
windows
were
let
at
ten
pounds
apiece
an
enormous
sum
in
those
days
the
poor
old
father
had
engaged
as
we
may
well
believe
one
of
the
best
places
from
which
the
eye
could
take
in
the
whole
of
the
terrible
scene
where
so
many
men
of
noble
blood
were
to
perish
on
a
vast
scaffold
covered
with
black
cloth
erected
in
the
middle
of
the
open
square
thither
on
the
morning
of
the
fatal
day
they
brought
the
a
name
given
to
the
block
on
which
the
condemned
man
laid
his
head
as
he
knelt
before
it
after
this
they
brought
an
draped
with
black
for
the
clerk
of
the
parliament
whose
business
it
was
to
call
up
the
condemned
noblemen
to
their
death
and
read
their
sentences
the
whole
square
was
guarded
from
early
morning
by
the
scottish
guard
and
the
gendarmes
of
the
king
s
household
in
order
to
keep
back
the
crowd
which
threatened
to
fill
it
before
the
hour
of
the
execution
after
a
solemn
mass
said
at
the
chateau
and
in
the
churches
of
the
town
the
condemned
lords
the
last
of
the
conspirators
who
were
left
alive
were
led
out
these
gentlemen
some
of
whom
had
been
put
to
the
torture
were
grouped
at
the
foot
of
the
scaffold
and
surrounded
by
monks
who
endeavored
to
make
them
abjure
the
doctrines
of
calvin
but
not
a
single
man
listened
to
the
words
of
the
priests
who
had
been
appointed
for
this
duty
by
the
cardinal
of
lorraine
among
whom
the
gentlemen
no
doubt
feared
to
find
spies
of
the
guises
in
order
to
avoid
the
importunity
of
these
antagonists
they
chanted
a
psalm
put
into
french
verse
by
clement
marot
calvin
as
we
all
know
had
ordained
that
prayers
to
god
should
be
in
the
language
of
each
country
as
much
from
a
principle
of
common
sense
as
in
opposition
to
the
roman
worship
to
those
in
the
crowd
who
pitied
these
unfortunate
gentlemen
it
was
a
moving
incident
to
hear
them
chant
the
following
verse
at
the
very
moment
when
the
king
and
court
arrived
and
took
their
places
god
be
merciful
unto
us
and
bless
us
and
show
us
the
light
of
his
countenance
and
be
merciful
unto
the
eyes
of
all
the
reformers
turned
to
their
leader
the
prince
de
conde
who
was
placed
intentionally
between
queen
mary
and
the
young
duc
d
orleans
catherine
de
medici
was
beside
the
king
and
the
rest
of
the
court
were
on
her
left
the
papal
nuncio
stood
behind
queen
mary
the
of
the
kingdom
the
duc
de
guise
was
on
horseback
below
the
balcony
with
two
of
the
marshals
of
france
and
his
staff
captains
when
the
prince
de
conde
appeared
all
the
condemned
noblemen
who
knew
him
bowed
to
him
and
the
brave
hunchback
returned
their
salutation
it
would
be
hard
he
remarked
to
the
duc
d
orleans
not
to
be
civil
to
those
about
to
the
two
other
balconies
were
filled
by
invited
guests
courtiers
and
persons
on
duty
about
the
court
in
short
the
whole
company
of
the
chateau
de
blois
had
come
to
amboise
to
assist
at
this
festival
of
death
precisely
as
it
passed
a
little
later
from
the
pleasures
of
a
court
to
the
perils
of
war
with
an
easy
facility
which
will
always
seem
to
foreigners
one
of
the
main
supports
of
their
policy
toward
france
the
poor
syndic
of
the
furriers
of
paris
was
filled
with
the
keenest
joy
at
not
seeing
his
son
among
the
gentlemen
who
were
condemned
to
die
at
a
sign
from
the
duc
de
guise
the
clerk
seated
on
the
scaffold
cried
in
a
loud
voice
baron
de
raunay
guilty
of
heresy
of
the
crime
of
and
assault
with
armed
hand
against
the
person
of
the
a
tall
handsome
man
mounted
the
scaffold
with
a
firm
step
bowed
to
the
people
and
the
court
and
said
that
sentence
lies
i
took
arms
to
deliver
the
king
from
his
enemies
the
he
placed
his
head
on
the
block
and
it
fell
the
reformers
chanted
thou
o
god
hast
proved
us
thou
hast
tried
us
as
silver
is
tried
in
the
fire
so
hast
thou
purified
briquemart
comte
de
villemongis
guilty
of
the
crime
of
and
of
attempts
against
the
person
of
the
king
called
the
clerk
the
count
dipped
his
hands
in
the
blood
of
the
baron
de
raunay
and
said
may
this
blood
recoil
upon
those
who
are
really
guilty
of
those
the
reformers
chanted
thou
broughtest
us
into
the
snare
thou
laidest
afflictions
upon
our
loins
thou
hast
suffered
our
enemies
to
ride
over
you
must
admit
monseigneur
said
the
prince
de
conde
to
the
papal
nuncio
that
if
these
french
gentlemen
know
how
to
conspire
they
also
know
how
to
what
hatreds
brother
whispered
the
duchesse
de
guise
to
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
you
are
drawing
down
upon
the
heads
of
our
children
the
sight
makes
me
sick
said
the
young
king
turning
pale
at
the
flow
of
blood
pooh
only
rebels
replied
catherine
de
medici
the
chants
went
on
the
axe
still
fell
the
sublime
spectacle
of
men
singing
as
they
died
and
above
all
the
impression
produced
upon
the
crowd
by
the
progressive
diminution
of
the
chanting
voices
superseded
the
fear
inspired
by
the
guises
mercy
cried
the
people
with
one
voice
when
they
heard
the
solitary
chant
of
the
last
and
most
important
of
the
great
lords
who
was
saved
to
be
the
final
victim
he
alone
remained
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
by
which
the
others
had
mounted
the
scaffold
and
he
chanted
thou
o
god
be
merciful
unto
us
and
bless
us
and
cause
thy
face
to
shine
upon
us
amen
come
duc
de
nemours
said
the
prince
de
conde
weary
of
the
part
he
was
playing
you
who
have
the
credit
of
the
skirmish
and
who
helped
to
make
these
men
prisoners
do
you
not
feel
under
an
obligation
to
ask
mercy
for
this
one
it
is
castelnau
who
they
say
received
your
word
of
honor
that
he
should
be
courteously
treated
if
he
do
you
think
i
waited
till
he
was
here
before
trying
to
save
him
said
the
duc
de
nemours
stung
by
the
stern
reproach
the
clerk
called
slowly
no
doubt
he
was
intentionally
slow
baron
de
accused
and
convicted
of
the
crime
of
and
of
attempts
against
the
person
of
the
no
said
castelnau
proudly
it
can
not
be
a
crime
to
oppose
the
tyranny
and
the
projected
usurpation
of
the
the
executioner
sick
of
his
task
saw
a
movement
in
the
king
s
gallery
and
fumbled
with
his
axe
monsieur
le
baron
he
said
i
do
not
want
to
execute
you
a
moment
s
delay
may
save
all
the
people
again
cried
mercy
come
said
the
king
mercy
for
that
poor
castelnau
who
saved
the
life
of
the
duc
d
the
cardinal
intentionally
misunderstood
the
king
s
speech
go
on
he
motioned
to
the
executioner
and
the
head
of
castelnau
fell
at
the
very
moment
when
the
king
had
pronounced
his
pardon
that
head
cardinal
goes
to
your
account
said
catherine
de
medici
the
day
after
this
dreadful
execution
the
prince
de
conde
returned
to
navarre
the
affair
produced
a
great
sensation
in
france
and
at
all
the
foreign
courts
the
torrents
of
noble
blood
then
shed
caused
such
anguish
to
the
chancellor
olivier
that
his
honorable
mind
perceiving
at
last
the
real
end
and
aim
of
the
guises
disguised
under
a
pretext
of
defending
religion
and
the
monarchy
felt
itself
no
longer
able
to
make
head
against
them
though
he
was
their
creature
he
was
not
willing
to
sacrifice
his
duty
and
the
throne
to
their
ambition
and
he
withdrew
from
his
post
suggesting
l
hopital
as
his
rightful
successor
catherine
hearing
of
olivier
s
suggestion
immediately
proposed
birago
and
put
much
warmth
into
her
request
the
cardinal
knowing
nothing
of
the
letter
written
by
l
hopital
to
the
and
supposing
him
faithful
to
the
house
of
lorraine
pressed
his
appointment
in
opposition
to
that
of
birago
and
catherine
allowed
herself
to
seem
vanquished
from
the
moment
that
l
hopital
entered
upon
his
duties
he
took
measures
against
the
inquisition
which
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
was
desirous
of
introducing
into
france
and
he
thwarted
so
successfully
all
the
policy
of
the
guises
and
proved
himself
so
true
a
frenchmen
that
in
order
to
subdue
him
he
was
exiled
within
three
months
of
his
appointment
to
his
of
vignay
near
etampes
the
worthy
old
lecamus
waited
impatiently
till
the
court
left
amboise
being
unable
to
find
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
either
of
the
queens
and
hoping
to
put
himself
in
their
way
as
the
court
advanced
along
the
on
its
return
to
blois
he
disguised
himself
as
a
pauper
at
the
risk
of
being
taken
for
a
spy
and
by
means
of
this
travesty
he
mingled
with
the
crowd
of
beggars
which
lined
the
roadway
after
the
departure
of
the
prince
de
conde
and
the
execution
of
the
leaders
the
duke
and
cardinal
thought
they
had
sufficiently
silenced
the
reformers
to
allow
the
a
little
more
freedom
lecamus
knew
that
instead
of
travelling
in
a
litter
catherine
intended
to
go
on
horseback
la
such
was
the
name
given
to
a
sort
of
stirrup
invented
for
or
by
the
who
having
hurt
her
leg
on
some
occasion
ordered
a
saddle
with
a
plank
on
which
she
could
place
both
feet
by
sitting
sideways
on
the
horse
and
passing
one
leg
through
a
depression
in
the
saddle
as
the
had
very
handsome
legs
she
was
accused
of
inventing
this
method
of
riding
in
order
to
show
them
the
old
furrier
fortunately
found
a
moment
when
he
could
present
himself
to
her
sight
but
the
instant
that
the
queen
recognized
him
she
gave
signs
of
displeasure
go
away
my
good
man
and
let
no
one
see
you
speak
to
me
she
said
with
anxiety
get
yourself
elected
deputy
to
the
by
the
guild
of
your
trade
and
act
for
me
when
the
assembly
convenes
at
orleans
you
shall
know
whom
to
trust
in
the
matter
of
your
is
he
living
asked
the
old
man
alas
said
the
queen
i
hope
lecamus
was
obliged
to
return
to
paris
with
nothing
better
than
those
doubtful
words
and
the
secret
of
the
approaching
convocation
of
the
thus
confided
to
him
by
the
cosmo
ruggiero
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
obtained
within
a
few
days
of
the
events
just
related
certain
revelations
as
to
the
culpability
of
the
court
of
navarre
at
lyon
and
at
mouvans
in
dauphine
a
body
of
reformers
under
command
of
the
most
enterprising
prince
of
the
house
of
bourbon
had
endeavored
to
incite
the
populace
to
rise
such
audacity
after
the
bloody
executions
at
amboise
astonished
the
guises
who
no
doubt
to
put
an
end
to
heresy
by
means
known
only
to
themselves
proposed
the
convocation
of
the
at
orleans
catherine
de
medici
seeing
a
chance
of
support
to
her
policy
in
a
national
representation
joyfully
agreed
to
it
the
cardinal
bent
on
recovering
his
prey
and
degrading
the
house
of
bourbon
convoked
the
states
for
the
sole
purpose
of
bringing
the
prince
de
conde
and
the
king
of
navarre
antoine
de
bourbon
father
of
henri
iv
to
orleans
intending
to
make
use
of
christophe
to
convict
the
prince
of
high
treason
if
he
succeeded
in
again
getting
him
within
the
power
of
the
crown
after
two
months
had
passed
in
the
prison
at
blois
christophe
was
removed
on
a
litter
to
a
which
sailed
up
the
loire
to
orleans
helped
by
a
westerly
wind
he
arrived
there
in
the
evening
and
was
taken
at
once
to
the
celebrated
tower
of
the
poor
lad
who
did
not
know
what
to
think
of
his
removal
had
plenty
of
time
to
reflect
on
his
conduct
and
on
his
future
he
remained
there
two
months
lying
on
his
pallet
unable
to
move
his
legs
the
bones
of
his
joints
were
broken
when
he
asked
for
the
help
of
a
surgeon
of
the
town
the
jailer
replied
that
the
orders
were
so
strict
about
him
that
he
dared
not
allow
any
one
but
himself
even
to
bring
him
food
this
severity
which
placed
him
virtually
in
solitary
confinement
amazed
christophe
to
his
mind
he
ought
either
to
be
hanged
or
released
for
he
was
of
course
entirely
ignorant
of
the
events
at
amboise
in
spite
of
certain
secret
advice
sent
to
them
by
catherine
de
medici
the
two
chiefs
of
the
house
of
bourbon
resolved
to
be
present
at
the
so
completely
did
the
autograph
letters
they
received
from
the
king
reassure
them
and
no
sooner
had
the
court
established
itself
at
orleans
than
it
learned
not
without
amazement
from
groslot
chancellor
of
navarre
that
the
bourbon
princes
had
arrived
francois
ii
established
himself
in
the
house
of
the
chancellor
of
navarre
who
was
also
in
other
words
chief
justice
of
the
law
courts
at
orleans
this
groslot
whose
dual
position
was
one
of
the
singularities
of
this
period
when
reformers
themselves
owned
abbeys
groslot
the
jacques
coeur
of
orleans
one
of
the
richest
burghers
of
the
day
did
not
bequeath
his
name
to
the
house
for
in
after
years
it
was
called
le
bailliage
having
been
undoubtedly
purchased
either
by
the
heirs
of
the
crown
or
by
the
provinces
as
the
proper
place
in
which
to
hold
the
legal
courts
this
charming
structure
built
by
the
bourgeoisie
of
the
sixteenth
century
which
completes
so
admirably
the
history
of
a
period
in
which
king
nobles
and
burghers
rivalled
each
other
in
the
grace
elegance
and
richness
of
their
dwellings
witness
varangeville
the
splendid
of
ango
and
the
mansion
called
that
of
hercules
in
paris
exists
to
this
day
though
in
a
state
to
fill
archaeologists
and
lovers
of
the
middle
ages
with
despair
it
would
be
difficult
however
to
go
to
orleans
and
not
take
notice
of
the
which
stands
on
the
place
de
l
estape
this
or
is
the
former
bailliage
the
mansion
of
groslot
the
most
illustrious
house
in
orleans
and
the
most
neglected
the
remains
of
this
old
building
will
still
show
to
the
eyes
of
an
archaeologist
how
magnificent
it
was
at
a
period
when
the
houses
of
the
burghers
were
commonly
built
of
wood
rather
than
stone
a
period
when
noblemen
alone
had
the
right
to
build
a
significant
word
having
served
as
the
dwelling
of
the
king
at
a
period
when
the
court
displayed
much
pomp
and
luxury
the
hotel
groslot
must
have
been
the
most
splendid
house
in
orleans
it
was
here
on
the
place
de
l
estape
that
the
guises
and
the
king
reviewed
the
burgher
guard
of
which
monsieur
de
cypierre
was
made
the
commander
during
the
sojourn
of
the
king
at
this
period
the
cathedral
of
afterward
completed
by
henri
who
chose
to
give
that
proof
of
the
sincerity
of
his
conversion
was
in
process
of
erection
and
its
neighborhood
heaped
with
stones
and
cumbered
with
piles
of
wood
was
occupied
by
the
guises
and
their
retainers
who
were
quartered
in
the
bishop
s
palace
now
destroyed
the
town
was
under
military
discipline
and
the
measures
taken
by
the
guises
proved
how
little
liberty
they
intended
to
leave
to
the
the
members
of
which
flocked
into
the
town
raising
the
rents
of
the
poorest
lodgings
the
court
the
burgher
militia
the
nobility
and
the
burghers
themselves
were
all
in
a
state
of
expectation
awaiting
some
and
they
found
themselves
not
mistaken
when
the
princes
of
the
blood
arrived
as
the
bourbon
princes
entered
the
king
s
chamber
the
court
saw
with
terror
the
insolent
bearing
of
cardinal
de
lorraine
determined
to
show
his
intentions
openly
he
remained
covered
while
the
king
of
navarre
stood
before
him
catherine
de
medici
lowered
her
eyes
not
to
show
the
indignation
that
she
felt
then
followed
a
solemn
explanation
between
the
young
king
and
the
two
chiefs
of
the
younger
branch
it
was
short
for
that
the
first
words
of
the
prince
de
conde
francois
ii
interrupted
him
with
threatening
looks
messieurs
my
cousins
i
had
supposed
the
affair
of
amboise
over
i
find
it
is
not
so
and
you
are
compelling
us
to
regret
the
indulgence
which
we
it
is
not
the
king
so
much
as
the
messieurs
de
guise
who
now
address
us
replied
the
prince
de
conde
adieu
monsieur
cried
the
little
king
crimson
with
anger
when
he
left
the
king
s
presence
the
prince
found
his
way
barred
in
the
great
hall
by
two
officers
of
the
scottish
guard
as
the
captain
of
the
french
guard
advanced
the
prince
drew
a
letter
from
his
doublet
and
said
to
him
in
presence
of
the
whole
court
can
you
read
that
paper
aloud
to
me
monsieur
de
willingly
said
the
french
captain
my
cousin
come
in
all
security
i
give
you
my
royal
word
that
you
can
do
so
if
you
have
need
of
a
safe
conduct
this
letter
will
serve
as
signed
said
the
shrewd
and
courageous
hunchback
signed
francois
said
maille
no
no
exclaimed
the
prince
it
is
signed
your
good
cousin
and
friend
francois
messieurs
he
said
to
the
scotch
guard
i
follow
you
to
the
prison
to
which
you
are
ordered
on
behalf
of
the
king
to
conduct
me
there
is
enough
nobility
in
this
hall
to
understand
the
matter
the
profound
silence
which
followed
these
words
ought
to
have
enlightened
the
guises
but
silence
is
that
to
which
all
princes
listen
least
monseigneur
said
the
cardinal
de
tournon
who
was
following
the
prince
you
know
well
that
since
the
affair
at
amboise
you
have
made
certain
attempts
both
at
lyon
and
at
mouvans
in
dauphine
against
the
royal
authority
of
which
the
king
had
no
knowledge
when
he
wrote
to
you
in
those
tricksters
cried
the
prince
laughing
you
have
made
a
public
declaration
against
the
mass
and
in
favor
of
we
are
masters
in
navarre
said
the
prince
you
mean
to
say
in
bearn
but
you
owe
homage
to
the
crown
replied
president
de
thou
ha
you
here
president
cried
the
prince
sarcastically
is
the
whole
parliament
with
you
so
saying
he
cast
a
look
of
contempt
upon
the
cardinal
and
left
the
hall
he
saw
plainly
enough
that
they
meant
to
have
his
head
the
next
day
when
messieurs
de
thou
de
viole
d
espesse
the
bourdin
and
the
chief
clerk
of
the
court
du
tillet
entered
his
presence
he
kept
them
standing
and
expressed
his
regrets
to
see
them
charged
with
a
duty
which
did
not
belong
to
them
then
he
said
to
the
clerk
write
down
what
i
say
and
dictated
as
follows
i
louis
de
bourbon
prince
de
conde
peer
of
the
kingdom
marquis
de
conti
comte
de
soissons
prince
of
the
blood
of
france
do
declare
that
i
formally
refuse
to
recognize
any
commission
appointed
to
try
me
because
in
my
quality
and
in
virtue
of
the
privilege
appertaining
to
all
members
of
the
royal
house
i
can
only
be
accused
tried
and
judged
by
the
parliament
of
peers
both
chambers
assembled
the
king
being
seated
on
his
bed
of
you
ought
to
know
that
gentlemen
better
than
others
he
added
and
this
reply
is
all
that
you
will
get
from
me
for
the
rest
i
trust
in
god
and
my
the
magistrates
continued
to
address
him
notwithstanding
his
obstinate
silence
the
king
of
navarre
was
left
at
liberty
but
closely
watched
his
prison
was
larger
than
that
of
the
prince
and
this
was
the
only
real
difference
in
the
position
of
the
two
brothers
the
intention
being
that
their
heads
should
fall
together
christophe
was
therefore
kept
in
the
strictest
solitary
confinement
by
order
of
the
cardinal
and
the
of
the
kingdom
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
give
the
judges
proof
of
the
culpability
of
the
prince
de
conde
the
letters
seized
on
lasagne
the
prince
s
secretary
though
intelligible
to
statesmen
where
not
sufficiently
plain
proof
for
judges
the
cardinal
intended
to
confront
the
prince
and
christophe
by
accident
and
it
was
not
without
intention
that
the
young
reformer
was
placed
in
one
of
the
lower
rooms
in
the
tower
of
with
a
window
looking
on
the
prison
yard
each
time
that
christophe
was
brought
before
the
magistrates
and
subjected
to
a
close
examination
he
sheltered
himself
behind
a
total
and
complete
denial
which
prolonged
his
trial
until
after
the
opening
of
the
old
lecamus
who
by
that
time
had
got
himself
elected
deputy
of
the
by
the
burghers
of
paris
arrived
at
orleans
a
few
days
after
the
arrest
of
the
prince
de
conde
this
news
which
reached
him
at
etampes
redoubled
his
anxiety
for
he
fully
understood
he
who
alone
knew
of
christophe
s
interview
with
the
prince
under
the
bridge
near
his
own
house
that
his
son
s
fate
was
closely
bound
up
with
that
of
the
leader
of
the
reformed
party
he
therefore
determined
to
study
the
dark
tangle
of
interests
which
were
struggling
together
at
court
in
order
to
discover
some
means
of
rescuing
his
son
it
was
useless
to
think
of
queen
catherine
who
refused
to
see
her
furrier
no
one
about
the
court
whom
he
was
able
to
address
could
give
him
any
satisfactory
information
about
christophe
and
he
fell
at
last
into
a
state
of
such
utter
despair
that
he
was
on
the
verge
of
appealing
to
the
cardinal
himself
when
he
learned
that
monsieur
de
thou
and
this
was
the
great
stain
upon
that
good
man
s
life
had
consented
to
be
one
of
the
judges
of
the
prince
de
conde
the
old
furrier
went
at
once
to
see
him
and
learned
at
last
that
christophe
was
still
living
though
a
prisoner
tourillon
the
glover
to
whom
la
renaudie
sent
christophe
on
his
way
to
blois
had
offered
a
room
in
his
house
to
the
sieur
lecamus
for
the
whole
time
of
his
stay
in
orleans
during
the
sittings
of
the
the
glover
believed
the
furrier
to
be
like
himself
secretly
attached
to
the
reformed
religion
but
he
soon
saw
that
a
father
who
fears
for
the
life
of
his
child
pays
no
heed
to
shades
of
religious
opinion
but
flings
himself
prone
upon
the
bosom
of
god
without
caring
what
insignia
men
give
to
him
the
poor
old
man
repulsed
in
all
his
efforts
wandered
like
one
bewildered
through
the
streets
contrary
to
his
expectations
his
money
availed
him
nothing
monsieur
de
thou
had
warned
him
that
if
he
bribed
any
servant
of
the
house
of
guise
he
would
merely
lose
his
money
for
the
duke
and
cardinal
allowed
nothing
that
related
to
christophe
to
transpire
de
thou
whose
fame
is
somewhat
tarnished
by
the
part
he
played
at
this
crisis
endeavored
to
give
some
hope
to
the
poor
father
but
he
trembled
so
much
himself
for
the
fate
of
his
godson
that
his
attempts
at
consolation
only
alarmed
the
old
man
still
more
lecamus
roamed
the
streets
in
three
months
he
had
shrunk
visibly
his
only
hope
now
lay
in
the
warm
friendship
which
for
so
many
years
had
bound
him
to
the
hippocrates
of
the
sixteenth
century
ambroise
pare
tried
to
say
a
word
to
queen
mary
on
leaving
the
chamber
of
the
king
who
was
then
indisposed
but
no
sooner
had
he
named
christophe
than
the
daughter
of
the
stuarts
nervous
at
the
prospect
of
her
fate
should
any
evil
happen
to
the
king
and
believing
that
the
reformers
were
attempting
to
poison
him
cried
out
if
my
uncles
had
only
listened
to
me
that
fanatic
would
have
been
hanged
the
evening
on
which
this
fatal
answer
was
repeated
to
old
lecamus
by
his
friend
pare
on
the
place
de
l
estape
he
returned
home
half
dead
to
his
own
chamber
refusing
to
eat
any
supper
tourillon
uneasy
about
him
went
up
to
his
room
and
found
him
in
tears
the
aged
eyes
showed
the
inflamed
red
lining
of
their
lids
so
that
the
glover
fancied
for
a
moment
that
he
was
weeping
tears
of
blood
comfort
yourself
father
said
the
reformer
the
burghers
of
orleans
are
furious
to
see
their
city
treated
as
though
it
were
taken
by
assault
and
guarded
by
the
soldiers
of
monsieur
de
cypierre
if
the
life
of
the
prince
de
conde
is
in
any
real
danger
we
will
soon
demolish
the
tower
of
the
whole
town
is
on
the
side
of
the
reformers
and
it
will
rise
in
rebellion
you
may
be
sure
of
that
but
even
if
they
hang
the
guises
it
will
not
give
me
back
my
son
said
the
wretched
father
at
that
instant
some
one
rapped
cautiously
on
tourillon
s
outer
door
and
the
glover
went
downstairs
to
open
it
himself
the
night
was
dark
in
these
troublous
times
the
masters
of
all
households
took
minute
precautions
tourillon
looked
through
the
cut
in
the
door
and
saw
a
stranger
whose
accent
indicated
an
italian
the
man
who
was
dressed
in
black
asked
to
speak
with
lecamus
on
matters
of
business
and
tourillon
admitted
him
when
the
furrier
caught
sight
of
his
visitor
he
shuddered
violently
but
the
stranger
managed
unseen
by
tourillon
to
lay
his
fingers
on
his
lips
lecamus
understanding
the
gesture
said
immediately
you
have
come
i
suppose
to
offer
furs
said
the
italian
discreetly
this
personage
was
no
other
than
the
famous
ruggiero
astrologer
to
the
tourillon
went
below
to
his
own
apartment
feeling
convinced
that
he
was
one
too
many
in
that
of
his
guest
where
can
we
talk
without
danger
of
being
overheard
said
the
cautious
florentine
we
ought
to
be
in
the
open
fields
for
that
replied
lecamus
but
we
are
not
allowed
to
leave
the
town
you
know
the
severity
with
which
the
gates
are
guarded
no
one
can
leave
orleans
without
a
pass
from
monsieur
de
cypierre
he
added
not
even
i
who
am
a
member
of
the
complaint
is
to
be
made
at
s
session
of
this
restriction
of
work
like
a
mole
but
don
t
let
your
paws
be
seen
in
anything
no
matter
what
said
the
wary
italian
will
no
doubt
prove
a
decisive
day
judging
by
my
observations
you
may
perhaps
recover
your
son
or
the
day
may
god
hear
you
you
who
are
thought
to
traffic
with
the
devil
come
to
my
place
said
the
astrologer
smiling
i
live
in
the
tower
of
sieur
touchet
de
beauvais
the
lieutenant
of
the
bailliage
whose
daughter
the
little
duc
d
orleans
has
taken
such
a
fancy
to
it
is
there
that
i
observe
the
planets
i
have
drawn
the
girl
s
horoscope
and
it
says
that
she
will
become
a
great
lady
and
be
beloved
by
a
king
the
lieutenant
her
father
is
a
clever
man
he
loves
science
and
the
queen
sent
me
to
lodge
with
him
he
has
had
the
sense
to
be
a
rabid
guisist
while
awaiting
the
reign
of
charles
the
furrier
and
the
astrologer
reached
the
house
of
the
sieur
de
beauvais
without
being
met
or
even
seen
but
in
case
lecamus
visit
should
be
discovered
the
florentine
intended
to
give
a
pretext
of
an
astrological
consultation
on
his
son
s
fate
when
they
were
safely
at
the
top
of
the
tower
where
the
astrologer
did
his
work
lecamus
said
to
him
is
my
son
really
living
yes
he
still
lives
replied
ruggiero
and
the
question
now
is
how
to
save
him
remember
this
seller
of
skins
i
would
not
give
two
farthings
for
yours
if
ever
in
all
your
life
a
single
syllable
should
escape
you
of
what
i
am
about
to
that
is
a
useless
caution
my
friend
i
have
been
furrier
to
the
court
since
the
time
of
the
late
louis
xii
this
is
the
fourth
reign
that
i
have
and
you
may
soon
see
the
fifth
remarked
ruggiero
what
do
you
know
about
my
son
he
has
been
put
to
the
poor
boy
said
the
old
man
raising
his
eyes
to
heaven
his
knees
and
ankles
were
a
bit
injured
but
he
has
won
a
royal
protection
which
will
extend
over
his
whole
life
said
the
florentine
hastily
seeing
the
terror
of
the
poor
father
your
little
christophe
has
done
a
service
to
our
great
queen
catherine
if
we
manage
to
pull
him
out
of
the
claws
of
the
guises
you
will
see
him
some
day
councillor
to
the
parliament
any
man
would
gladly
have
his
bones
cracked
three
times
over
to
stand
so
high
in
the
good
graces
of
this
dear
sovereign
a
grand
and
noble
genius
who
will
triumph
in
the
end
over
all
obstacles
i
have
drawn
the
horoscope
of
the
duc
de
guise
he
will
be
killed
within
a
year
well
so
christophe
saw
the
prince
de
conde
you
who
read
the
future
ought
to
know
the
past
said
the
furrier
my
good
man
i
am
not
questioning
you
i
am
telling
you
a
fact
now
if
your
son
who
will
be
placed
in
the
prince
s
way
as
he
passes
should
recognize
him
or
if
the
prince
should
recognize
your
son
the
head
of
monsieur
de
conde
will
fall
god
knows
what
will
become
of
his
accomplice
however
don
t
be
alarmed
neither
your
son
nor
the
prince
will
die
i
have
drawn
their
horoscope
they
will
live
but
i
do
not
know
in
what
way
they
will
get
out
of
this
affair
without
distrusting
the
certainty
of
my
calculations
we
must
do
something
to
bring
about
results
the
prince
will
receive
from
sure
hands
a
in
which
we
convey
the
information
to
him
god
grant
that
your
son
be
cautious
for
him
we
can
not
warn
a
single
glance
of
recognition
will
cost
the
prince
s
life
therefore
although
the
has
every
reason
to
trust
in
christophe
s
faithfulness
they
ve
put
it
to
a
cruel
test
cried
the
furrier
don
t
speak
so
do
you
think
the
is
on
a
bed
of
roses
she
is
taking
measures
as
if
the
guises
had
already
decided
on
the
death
of
the
prince
and
right
she
is
the
wise
and
prudent
queen
now
listen
to
me
she
counts
on
you
to
help
her
in
all
things
you
have
some
influence
with
the
where
you
represent
the
body
of
the
guilds
of
paris
and
though
the
guisards
may
promise
you
to
set
your
son
at
liberty
try
to
fool
them
and
maintain
the
independence
of
the
guilds
demand
the
as
regent
the
king
of
navarre
will
publicly
accept
the
proposal
at
the
session
of
the
but
the
king
the
king
will
die
replied
ruggiero
i
have
read
his
horoscope
what
the
requires
you
to
do
for
her
at
the
is
a
very
simple
thing
but
there
is
a
far
greater
service
which
she
asks
of
you
you
helped
ambroise
pare
in
his
studies
you
are
his
friend
ambroise
now
loves
the
duc
de
guise
more
than
he
loves
me
and
he
is
right
for
he
owes
his
place
to
him
besides
he
is
faithful
to
the
king
though
he
inclines
to
the
reformed
religion
he
will
never
do
anything
against
his
curse
these
honest
men
cried
the
florentine
ambroise
boasted
this
evening
that
he
could
bring
the
little
king
safely
through
his
present
illness
for
he
is
really
ill
if
the
king
recovers
his
health
the
guises
triumph
the
princes
die
the
house
of
bourbon
becomes
extinct
we
shall
return
to
florence
your
son
will
be
hanged
and
the
lorrains
will
easily
get
the
better
of
the
other
sons
of
france
great
god
exclaimed
lecamus
don
t
cry
out
in
that
way
it
is
like
a
burgher
who
knows
nothing
of
the
court
but
go
at
once
to
ambroise
and
find
out
from
him
what
he
intends
to
do
to
save
the
king
s
life
if
there
is
anything
decided
on
come
back
to
me
at
once
and
tell
me
the
treatment
in
which
he
has
such
but
said
lecamus
obey
blindly
my
dear
friend
otherwise
you
will
get
your
mind
he
is
right
thought
the
furrier
i
had
better
not
know
more
and
he
went
at
once
in
search
of
the
king
s
surgeon
who
lived
at
a
hostelry
in
the
place
du
martroi
catherine
de
medici
was
at
this
moment
in
a
political
extremity
very
much
like
that
in
which
poor
christophe
had
seen
her
at
blois
though
she
had
been
in
a
way
trained
by
the
struggle
though
she
had
exercised
her
lofty
intellect
by
the
lessons
of
that
first
defeat
her
present
situation
while
nearly
the
same
had
become
more
critical
more
perilous
than
it
was
at
amboise
events
like
the
woman
herself
had
magnified
though
she
seemed
to
be
in
full
accordance
with
the
guises
catherine
held
in
her
hand
the
threads
of
a
wisely
planned
conspiracy
against
her
terrible
associates
and
was
only
awaiting
a
propitious
moment
to
throw
off
the
mask
the
cardinal
had
just
obtained
the
positive
certainty
that
catherine
was
deceiving
him
her
subtle
italian
spirit
felt
that
the
younger
branch
was
the
best
hindrance
she
could
offer
to
the
ambition
of
the
duke
and
the
cardinal
and
in
spite
of
the
advice
of
the
two
gondis
who
urged
her
to
let
the
guises
wreak
their
vengeance
on
the
bourbons
she
defeated
the
scheme
concocted
by
them
with
spain
to
seize
the
province
of
bearn
by
warning
jeanne
d
albret
queen
of
navarre
of
that
threatened
danger
as
this
state
secret
was
known
only
to
them
and
to
the
the
guises
knew
of
course
who
had
betrayed
it
and
resolved
to
send
her
back
to
florence
but
in
order
to
make
themselves
perfectly
sure
of
what
they
called
her
treason
against
the
state
the
state
being
the
house
of
lorraine
the
duke
and
cardinal
confided
to
her
their
intention
of
getting
rid
of
the
king
of
navarre
the
precautions
instantly
taken
by
antoine
proved
conclusively
to
the
two
brothers
that
the
secrets
known
only
to
them
and
the
had
been
divulged
by
the
latter
the
cardinal
instantly
taxed
her
with
treachery
in
presence
of
francois
threatening
her
with
an
edict
of
banishment
in
case
of
future
indiscretion
which
might
as
they
said
put
the
kingdom
in
danger
catherine
who
then
felt
herself
in
the
utmost
peril
acted
in
the
spirit
of
a
great
king
giving
proof
of
her
high
capacity
it
must
be
added
however
that
she
was
ably
seconded
by
her
friends
l
hopital
managed
to
send
her
a
note
written
in
the
following
terms
do
not
allow
a
prince
of
the
blood
to
be
put
to
death
by
a
committee
or
you
will
yourself
be
carried
off
in
some
catherine
sent
birago
to
vignay
to
tell
the
chancellor
l
hopital
to
come
to
orleans
at
once
in
spite
of
his
being
in
disgrace
birago
returned
the
very
night
of
which
we
are
writing
and
was
now
a
few
miles
from
orleans
with
l
hopital
who
heartily
avowed
himself
for
the
chiverni
whose
fidelity
was
very
justly
suspected
by
the
guises
had
escaped
from
orleans
and
reached
ecouen
in
ten
hours
by
a
forced
march
which
almost
cost
him
his
life
there
he
told
the
connetable
de
montmorency
of
the
peril
of
his
nephew
the
prince
de
conde
and
the
audacious
hopes
of
the
guises
the
connetable
furious
at
the
thought
that
the
prince
s
life
hung
upon
that
of
francois
started
for
orleans
at
once
with
a
hundred
noblemen
and
fifteen
hundred
cavalry
in
order
to
take
the
messieurs
de
guise
by
surprise
he
avoided
paris
and
came
direct
from
ecouen
to
corbeil
and
from
corbeil
to
pithiviers
by
the
valley
of
the
essonne
soldier
against
soldier
we
must
leave
no
chances
he
said
on
the
occasion
of
this
bold
march
anne
de
montmorency
who
had
saved
france
at
the
time
of
the
invasion
of
provence
by
charles
and
the
duc
de
guise
who
had
stopped
the
second
invasion
by
the
emperor
at
metz
were
in
truth
the
two
great
warriors
of
france
at
this
period
catherine
had
awaited
this
precise
moment
to
rouse
the
inextinguishable
hatred
of
the
connetable
whose
disgrace
and
banishment
were
the
work
of
the
guises
the
marquis
de
simeuse
however
who
commanded
at
gien
being
made
aware
of
the
large
force
approaching
under
command
of
the
connetable
jumped
on
his
horse
hoping
to
reach
orleans
in
time
to
warn
the
duke
and
cardinal
sure
that
the
connetable
would
come
to
the
rescue
of
his
nephew
and
full
of
confidence
in
the
chancelier

hopital

devotion
to
the
royal
cause

revived
the
hopes
and
the
boldness
of
the
reformed
party
the
colignys
and
the
friends
of
the
house
of
bourbon
aware
of
their
danger
now
made
common
cause
with
the
adherents
of
the
a
coalition
between
these
opposing
interests
attacked
by
a
common
enemy
formed
itself
silently
in
the
where
it
soon
became
a
question
of
appointing
catherine
as
regent
in
case
the
king
should
die
catherine
whose
faith
in
astrology
was
much
greater
than
her
faith
in
the
church
now
dared
all
against
her
oppressors
seeing
that
her
son
was
ill
and
apparently
dying
at
the
expiration
of
the
time
assigned
to
his
life
by
the
famous
sorceress
whom
nostradamus
had
brought
to
her
at
the
chateau
of
chaumont
xi
ambroise
pare
some
days
before
the
terrible
end
of
the
reign
of
francois
the
king
insisted
on
sailing
down
the
loire
wishing
not
to
be
in
the
town
of
orleans
on
the
day
when
the
prince
de
conde
was
executed
having
yielded
the
head
of
the
prince
to
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
he
was
equally
in
dread
of
a
rebellion
among
the
townspeople
and
of
the
prayers
and
supplications
of
the
princesse
de
conde
at
the
moment
of
embarkation
one
of
the
cold
winds
which
sweep
along
the
loire
at
the
beginning
of
winter
gave
him
so
sharp
an
that
he
was
obliged
to
return
to
his
apartments
there
he
took
to
his
bed
not
leaving
it
again
until
he
died
in
contradiction
of
the
doctors
who
with
the
exception
of
chapelain
were
his
enemies
ambroise
pare
insisted
that
an
abscess
was
formed
in
the
king
s
head
and
that
unless
an
issue
were
given
to
it
the
danger
of
death
would
increase
daily
notwithstanding
the
lateness
of
the
hour
and
the
curfew
law
which
was
sternly
enforced
in
orleans
at
this
time
practically
in
a
state
of
siege
pare
s
lamp
shone
from
his
window
and
he
was
deep
in
study
when
lecamus
called
to
him
from
below
recognizing
the
voice
of
his
old
friend
pare
ordered
that
he
should
be
admitted
you
take
no
rest
ambroise
while
saving
the
lives
of
others
you
are
wasting
your
own
said
the
furrier
as
he
entered
looking
at
the
surgeon
who
sat
with
opened
books
and
scattered
instruments
before
the
head
of
a
dead
man
lately
buried
and
now
disinterred
in
which
he
had
cut
an
opening
it
is
a
matter
of
saving
the
king
s
are
you
sure
of
doing
it
ambroise
cried
the
old
man
trembling
as
sure
as
i
am
of
my
own
existence
the
king
my
old
friend
has
a
morbid
ulcer
pressing
on
his
brain
which
will
presently
suffice
it
if
no
vent
is
given
to
it
and
the
danger
is
imminent
but
by
boring
the
skull
i
expect
to
release
the
pus
and
clear
the
head
i
have
already
performed
this
operation
three
times
it
was
invented
by
a
piedmontese
but
i
have
had
the
honor
to
perfect
it
the
first
operation
i
performed
was
at
the
siege
of
metz
on
monsieur
de
pienne
whom
i
cured
who
was
afterwards
all
the
more
intelligent
in
consequence
his
was
an
abscess
caused
by
the
blow
of
an
arquebuse
the
second
was
on
the
head
of
a
pauper
on
whom
i
wanted
to
prove
the
value
of
the
audacious
operation
monsieur
de
pienne
had
allowed
me
to
perform
the
third
i
did
in
paris
on
a
gentleman
who
is
now
entirely
recovered
trepanning
that
is
the
name
given
to
the
operation
is
very
little
known
patients
refuse
it
partly
because
of
the
imperfection
of
the
instruments
but
i
have
at
last
improved
them
i
am
practising
now
on
this
skull
that
i
may
be
sure
of
not
failing
when
i
operate
on
the
head
of
the
you
ought
indeed
to
be
very
sure
you
are
right
for
your
own
head
would
be
in
danger
in
case
i
d
wager
my
life
i
can
cure
him
replied
ambroise
with
the
conviction
of
a
man
of
genius
ah
my
old
friend
where
s
the
danger
of
boring
into
a
skull
with
proper
precautions
that
is
what
soldiers
do
in
battle
every
day
of
their
lives
without
taking
any
my
son
said
the
burgher
boldly
do
you
know
that
to
save
the
king
is
to
ruin
france
do
you
know
that
this
instrument
of
yours
will
place
the
crown
of
the
valois
on
the
head
of
the
lorrain
who
calls
himself
the
heir
of
charlemagne
do
you
know
that
surgery
and
policy
are
at
this
moment
sternly
opposed
to
each
other
yes
the
triumph
of
your
genius
will
be
the
death
of
your
religion
if
the
guises
gain
the
regency
the
blood
of
the
reformers
will
flow
like
water
be
a
greater
citizen
than
you
are
a
surgeon
oversleep
yourself
morning
and
leave
a
free
field
to
the
other
doctors
who
if
they
can
not
cure
the
king
will
cure
i
exclaimed
pare
i
leave
a
man
to
die
when
i
can
cure
him
no
no
were
i
to
hang
as
an
abettor
of
calvin
i
shall
go
early
to
court
do
you
not
feel
that
the
first
and
only
reward
i
shall
ask
will
be
the
life
of
your
christophe
surely
at
such
a
moment
queen
mary
can
deny
me
alas
my
friend
returned
lecamus
the
little
king
has
refused
the
pardon
of
the
prince
de
conde
to
the
princess
do
not
kill
your
religion
by
saving
the
life
of
a
man
who
ought
to
do
not
you
meddle
with

honest
men
can
have
but
one
motto
ce
que
dois
advienne
que
do
thy
duty
come
what
will
that
is
what
i
did
at
the
siege
of
calais
when
i
put
my
foot
on
the
face
of
the
duc
de
guise
i
ran
the
risk
of
being
strangled
by
his
friends
and
his
servants
but
i
am
surgeon
to
the
king
moreover
i
am
of
the
reformed
religion
and
yet
the
guises
are
my
friends
i
shall
save
the
king
cried
the
surgeon
with
the
sacred
enthusiasm
of
a
conviction
bestowed
by
genius
and
god
will
save
france
a
knock
was
heard
on
the
street
door
and
presently
one
of
pare
s
servants
gave
a
paper
to
lecamus
who
read
aloud
these
terrifying
words
a
scaffold
is
being
erected
at
the
convent
of
the
recollets
the
prince
de
conde
will
be
beheaded
there
ambroise
and
lecamus
looked
at
each
other
with
an
expression
of
the
deepest
horror
i
will
go
and
see
it
for
myself
said
the
furrier
no
sooner
was
he
in
the
open
street
than
ruggiero
took
his
arm
and
asked
by
what
means
ambroise
pare
proposed
to
save
the
king
fearing
some
trickery
the
old
man
instead
of
answering
replied
that
he
wished
to
go
and
see
the
scaffold
the
astrologer
accompanied
him
to
the
place
des
recollets
and
there
truly
enough
they
found
the
carpenters
putting
up
the
horrible
framework
by
torchlight
hey
my
friend
said
lecamus
to
one
of
the
men
what
are
you
doing
here
at
this
time
of
night
we
are
preparing
for
the
hanging
of
heretics
as
the
at
amboise
didn
t
cure
them
said
a
young
recollet
who
was
superintending
the
work
monseigneur
the
cardinal
is
very
right
said
ruggiero
prudently
but
in
my
country
we
do
what
do
you
do
said
the
young
priest
we
burn
lecamus
was
forced
to
lean
on
the
astrologer
s
arm
for
his
legs
gave
way
beneath
him
he
thought
it
probable
that
on
the
morrow
his
son
would
hang
from
one
of
those
gibbets
the
poor
old
man
was
thrust
between
two
sciences
astrology
and
surgery
both
of
which
promised
him
the
life
of
his
son
for
whom
in
all
probability
that
scaffold
was
now
erecting
in
the
trouble
and
distress
of
his
mind
the
florentine
was
able
to
knead
him
like
dough
well
my
worthy
dealer
in
minever
what
do
you
say
now
to
the
lorraine
jokes
whispered
ruggiero
alas
you
know
i
would
give
my
skin
if
that
of
my
son
were
safe
and
that
is
talking
like
your
trade
said
the
italian
but
explain
to
me
the
operation
which
ambroise
means
to
perform
upon
the
king
and
in
return
i
will
promise
you
the
life
of
your
faithfully
exclaimed
the
old
furrier
shall
i
swear
it
to
you
said
ruggiero
thereupon
the
poor
old
man
repeated
his
conversation
with
ambroise
pare
to
the
astrologer
who
the
moment
that
the
secret
of
the
great
surgeon
was
divulged
to
him
left
the
poor
father
abruptly
in
the
street
in
utter
despair
what
the
devil
does
he
mean
that
miscreant
cried
lecamus
as
he
watched
ruggiero
hurrying
with
rapid
steps
to
the
place
de
l
estape
lecamus
was
ignorant
of
the
terrible
scene
that
was
taking
place
around
the
royal
bed
where
the
imminent
danger
of
the
king
s
death
and
the
consequent
loss
of
power
to
the
guises
had
caused
the
hasty
erection
of
the
scaffold
for
the
prince
de
conde
whose
sentence
had
been
pronounced
as
it
were
by
default
the
execution
of
it
being
delayed
by
the
king
s
illness
absolutely
no
one
but
the
persons
on
duty
were
in
the
halls
staircases
and
courtyard
of
the
royal
residence
le
bailliage
the
crowd
of
courtiers
were
flocking
to
the
house
of
the
king
of
navarre
on
whom
the
regency
would
devolve
on
the
death
of
the
king
according
to
the
laws
of
the
kingdom
the
french
nobility
alarmed
by
the
audacity
of
the
guises
felt
the
need
of
rallying
around
the
chief
of
the
younger
branch
when
ignorant
of
the
s
italian
policy
they
saw
her
the
apparent
slave
of
the
duke
and
cardinal
antoine
de
bourbon
faithful
to
his
secret
agreement
with
catherine

bound
not
to
renounce
the
regency
in
her
favor
until
the
had
declared
for
it
the
solitude
in
which
the
king
s
house
was
left
had
a
powerful
effect
on
the
mind
of
the
duc
de
guise
when
on
his
return
from
an
inspection
made
by
way
of
precaution
through
the
city
he
found
no
one
there
but
the
friends
who
were
attached
exclusively
to
his
own
fortunes

chamber
in
which

at
that
period

in

of

boards

with

were
exposed
the
of
the
kingdom
crossed
the
room
on
his
entrance
casting
a
rapid
glance
about
him
and
bowed
to
the
duc
d
orleans
whom
he
saw
there
monseigneur
he
said
this
will
teach
you
to
know
men
the
catholic
nobility
of
the
kingdom
have
gone
to
pay
court
to
a
heretic
prince
believing
that
the
will
give
the
regency
to
the
heirs
of
a
traitor
who
long
detained
in
prison
your
illustrious
then
having
said
these
words
which
were
destined
to
plough
a
furrow
in
the
heart
of
the
young
prince
he
passed
into
the
bedroom
where
the
king
was
not
so
much
asleep
as
plunged
in
a
heavy
torpor
the
duc
de
guise
was
usually
able
to
correct
the
sinister
aspect
of
his
scarred
face
by
an
affable
and
pleasing
manner
but
on
this
occasion
when
he
saw
the
instrument
of
his
power
breaking
in
his
very
hands
he
was
unable
to
force
a
smile
the
cardinal
whose
civil
courage
was
equal
to
his
brother
s
military
daring
advanced
a
few
steps
to
meet
him
robertet
thinks
that
little
pinard
is
sold
to
the
he
whispered
leading
the
duke
into
the
hall
they
are
using
him
to
work
upon
the
members
of
the
well
what
does
it
signify
if
we
are
betrayed
by
a
secretary
when
all
else
betrays
us
cried
the
the
town
is
for
the
reformation
and
we
are
on
the
eve
of
a
revolt
yes
the
are
discontented
he
continued
giving
the
orleans
people
their
nickname
and
if
pare
does
not
save
the
king
we
shall
have
a
terrible
uprising
before
long
we
shall
be
forced
to
besiege
orleans
which
is
nothing
but
a
bog
of
i
have
been
watching
that
italian
woman
said
the
cardinal
as
she
sits
there
with
absolute
insensibility
she
is
watching
and
waiting
god
forgive
her
for
the
death
of
her
son
and
i
ask
myself
whether
we
should
not
do
a
wise
thing
to
arrest
her
at
once
and
also
the
king
of
it
is
already
more
than
we
want
upon
our
hands
to
have
the
prince
de
conde
in
prison
replied
the
duke
the
sound
of
a
horseman
riding
in
haste
to
the
gate
of
the
bailliage
echoed
through
the
hall
the
duke
and
cardinal
went
to
the
window
and
by
the
light
of
the
torches
which
were
in
the
portico
the
duke
recognized
on
the
rider
s
hat
the
famous
lorraine
cross
which
the
cardinal
had
lately
ordered
his
partisans
to
wear
he
sent
an
officer
of
the
guard
who
was
stationed
in
the
antechamber
to
give
entrance
to
the
and
went
himself
followed
by
his
brother
to
meet
him
on
the
landing
what
is
it
my
dear
simeuse
asked
the
duke
with
that
charm
of
manner
which
he
always
displayed
to
military
men
as
soon
as
he
recognized
the
governor
of
gien
the
connetable
has
reached
pithiviers
he
left
ecouen
with
two
thousand
cavalry
and
one
hundred
with
their
suites
yes
monseigneur
replied
simeuse
in
all
two
thousand
six
hundred
men
some
say
that
thore
is
behind
them
with
a
body
of
infantry
if
the
connetable
delays
awhile
expecting
his
son
you
still
have
time
to
repulse
is
that
all
you
know
are
the
reasons
of
this
sudden
call
to
arms
made
known
montmorency
talks
as
little
as
he
writes
go
you
and
meet
him
brother
while
i
prepare
to
welcome
him
with
the
head
of
his
nephew
said
the
cardinal
giving
orders
that
robertet
be
sent
to
him
at
once
vieilleville
cried
the
duke
to
the
marechal
who
came
immediately
the
connetable
has
the
audacity
to
come
here
under
arms
if
i
go
to
meet
him
will
you
be
responsible
to
hold
the
town
as
soon
as
you
leave
it
the
burghers
will
fly
to
arms
and
who
can
answer
for
the
result
of
an
affair
between
cavalry
and
citizens
in
these
narrow
streets
replied
the
marechal
monseigneur
said
robertet
rushing
hastily
up
the
stairs
the
chancelier
de
l
hopital
is
at
the
gate
and
asks
to
enter
are
we
to
let
him
in
yes
open
the
gate
answered
the
cardinal
connetable
and
chancelier
together
would
be
dangerous
we
must
separate
them
we
have
been
boldly
tricked
by
the
into
choosing
l
hopital
as
robertet
nodded
to
a
captain
of
the
guard
who
awaited
an
answer
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
then
he
turned
round
quickly
to
receive
the
orders
of
the
cardinal
monseigneur
i
take
the
liberty
he
said
making
one
last
effort
to
point
out
that
the
sentence
should
be
approved
by
king
in
if
you
violate
the
law
on
a
prince
of
the
blood
it
will
not
be
respected
for
either
a
cardinal
or
a
duc
de
pinard
has
upset
your
mind
robertet
said
the
cardinal
sternly
do
you
not
know
that
the
king
signed
the
order
of
execution
the
day
he
was
about
to
leave
orleans
in
order
that
the
sentence
might
be
carried
out
in
his
absence
the
listened
to
this
discussion
without
a
word
but
he
took
his
brother
by
the
arm
and
led
him
into
a
corner
of
the
hall
undoubtedly
he
said
the
heirs
of
charlemagne
have
the
right
to
recover
the
crown
which
was
usurped
from
their
house
by
hugh
capet
but
can
they
do
it
the
pear
is
not
yet
ripe
our
nephew
is
dying
and
the
whole
court
has
gone
over
to
the
king
of
the
king
s
heart
failed
him
or
the
bearnais
would
have
been
stabbed
before
now
said
the
cardinal
and
we
could
easily
have
disposed
of
the
valois
we
are
very
here
said
the
duke
the
rebellion
of
the
town
will
be
supported
by
the
l
hopital
whom
we
protected
while
the
opposed
his
appointment
is
against
us
and
yet
it
is
that
we
should
have
the
justiciary
with
us
catherine
has
too
many
supporters
at
the
present
time
we
can
not
send
her
back
to
italy
besides
there
are
still
three
valois
princes
she
is
no
longer
a
mother
she
is
all
queen
said
the
cardinal
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
moment
to
make
an
end
of
her
vigor
and
more
and
more
vigor
that
s
my
prescription
he
cried
so
saying
the
cardinal
returned
to
the
king
s
chamber
followed
by
the
duke
the
priest
went
straight
to
the
the
papers
of
lasagne
the
secretary
of
the
prince
de
conde
have
been
communicated
to
you
and
you
now
know
that
the
bourbons
are
endeavoring
to
dethrone
your
i
know
all
that
said
catherine
well
then
will
you
give
orders
to
arrest
the
king
of
navarre
there
is
she
said
with
dignity
a
of
the
at
this
instant
francois
ii
groaned
piteously
complaining
aloud
of
the
terrible
pains
in
his
ear
the
physician
left
the
fireplace
where
he
was
warming
himself
and
went
to
the
bedside
to
examine
the
king
s
head
well
monsieur
said
the
duc
de
guise
interrogatively
i
dare
not
take
upon
myself
to
apply
a
blister
to
draw
the
abscess
maitre
ambroise
has
promised
to
save
the
king
s
life
by
an
operation
and
i
might
thwart
let
us
postpone
the
treatment
till
morning
said
catherine
coldly
and
order
all
the
physicians
to
be
present
for
we
all
know
the
calumnies
to
which
the
death
of
kings
gives
she
went
to
her
son
and
kissed
his
hand
then
she
withdrew
to
her
own
apartments
with
what
composure
that
audacious
daughter
of
a
alluded
to
the
death
of
the
dauphin
poisoned
by
montecuculi
one
of
her
own
italian
followers
said
mary
stuart
mary
cried
the
little
king
my
grandfather
never
doubted
her
can
we
prevent
that
woman
from
coming
here
said
the
queen
to
her
uncles
in
a
low
voice
what
will
become
of
us
if
the
king
dies
returned
the
cardinal
in
a
whisper
catherine
will
shovel
us
all
into
his
thus
the
question
was
plainly
put
between
catherine
de
medici
and
the
house
of
lorraine
during
that
fatal
night
the
arrival
of
the
connetable
de
montmorency
and
the
chancelier
de
l
hopital
were
distinct
indications
of
rebellion
the
morning
of
the
next
day
would
therefore
be
decisive
xii
death
of
francois
ii
on
the
morrow
the
was
the
first
to
enter
the
king
s
chamber
she
found
no
one
there
but
mary
stuart
pale
and
weary
who
had
passed
the
night
in
prayer
beside
the
bed
the
duchesse
de
guise
had
kept
her
mistress
company
and
the
maids
of
honor
had
taken
turns
in
relieving
one
another
the
young
king
slept
neither
the
duke
nor
the
cardinal
had
yet
appeared
the
priest
who
was
bolder
than
the
soldier
had
it
was
afterward
said
put
forth
his
utmost
energy
during
the
night
to
induce
his
brother
to
make
himself
king
but
in
face
of
the
assembled
and
threatened
by
a
battle
with
montmorency
the
balafre
declared
the
circumstances
unfavorable
he
refused
against
his
brother
s
utmost
urgency
to
arrest
the
king
of
navarre
the
l
hopital
the
cardinal
de
tournon
the
gondis
ruggiero
and
birago
objecting
that
such
violent
measures
would
bring
on
a
general
rebellion
he
postponed
the
cardinal
s
scheme
until
the
fate
of
francois
ii
should
be
determined
the
deepest
silence
reigned
in
the
king
s
chamber
catherine
accompanied
by
madame
de
fiesque
went
to
the
bedside
and
gazed
at
her
son
with
a
semblance
of
grief
that
was
admirably
simulated
she
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
walked
to
the
window
where
madame
de
fiesque
brought
her
a
seat
thence
she
could
see
into
the
courtyard
it
had
been
agreed
between
catherine
and
the
cardinal
de
tournon
that
if
the
connetable
should
successfully
enter
the
town
the
cardinal
would
come
to
the
king
s
house
with
the
two
gondis
if
otherwise
he
would
come
alone
at
nine
in
the
morning
the
duke
and
cardinal
followed
by
their
gentlemen
who
remained
in
the
hall
entered
the
king
s
bedroom
the
captain
on
duty
having
informed
them
that
ambroise
pare
had
arrived
together
with
chapelain
and
three
other
physicians
who
hated
pare
and
were
all
in
the
s
interests
a
few
moments
later
and
the
great
hall
of
the
bailliage
presented
much
the
same
aspect
as
that
of
the
salle
des
gardes
at
blois
on
the
day
when
christophe
was
put
to
the
torture
and
the
duc
de
guise
was
proclaimed
of
the
kingdom
with
the
single
exception
that
whereas
love
and
joy
overflowed
the
royal
chamber
and
the
guises
triumphed
death
and
mourning
now
reigned
within
that
darkened
room
and
the
guises
felt
that
power
was
slipping
through
their
fingers
the
maids
of
honor
of
the
two
queens
were
again
in
their
separate
camps
on
either
side
of
the
fireplace
in
which
glowed
a
monstrous
fire
the
hall
was
filled
with
courtiers
the
news
spread
about
no
one
knew
how
of
some
daring
operation
contemplated
by
ambroise
pare
to
save
the
king
s
life
had
brought
back
the
lords
and
gentlemen
who
had
deserted
the
house
the
day
before
the
outer
staircase
and
courtyard
were
filled
by
an
anxious
crowd
the
scaffold
erected
during
the
night
for
the
prince
de
conde
opposite
to
the
convent
of
the
recollets
had
amazed
and
startled
the
whole
nobility
all
present
spoke
in
a
low
voice
and
the
talk
was
the
same
mixture
as
at
blois
of
frivolous
and
serious
light
and
earnest
matters
the
habit
of
expecting
troubles
sudden
revolutions
calls
to
arms
rebellions
and
great
events
which
marked
the
long
period
during
which
the
house
of
valois
was
slowly
being
extinguished
in
spite
of
catherine
de
medici
s
great
efforts
to
preserve
it
took
its
rise
at
this
time
a
deep
silence
prevailed
for
a
certain
distance
beyond
the
door
of
the
king
s
chamber
which
was
guarded
by
two
halberdiers
two
pages
and
by
the
captain
of
the
scotch
guard
antoine
de
bourbon
king
of
navarre
held
a
prisoner
in
his
own
house
learned
by
his
present
desertion
the
hopes
of
the
courtiers
who
had
flocked
to
him
the
day
before
and
was
horrified
by
the
news
of
the
preparations
made
during
the
night
for
the
execution
of
his
brother
standing
before
the
fireplace
in
the
great
hall
of
the
bailliage
was
one
of
the
greatest
and
noblest
figures
of
that
day
the
chancelier
de
l
hopital
wearing
his
crimson
robe
lined
and
edged
with
ermine
and
his
cap
on
his
head
according
to
the
privilege
of
his
office
this
courageous
man
seeing
that
his
benefactors
were
traitorous
and
held
firmly
to
the
cause
of
the
kings
represented
by
the
at
the
risk
of
losing
his
head
he
had
gone
to
rouen
to
consult
with
the
connetable
de
montmorency
no
one
ventured
to
draw
him
from
the
reverie
in
which
he
was
plunged
robertet
the
secretary
of
state
two
marshals
of
france
vieilleville
and
and
the
keeper
of
the
seals
were
collected
in
a
group
before
the
chancellor
the
courtiers
present
were
not
precisely
jesting
but
their
talk
was
malicious
especially
among
those
who
were
not
for
the
guises
presently
voices
were
heard
to
rise
in
the
king
s
chamber
the
two
marshals
robertet
and
the
chancellor
went
nearer
to
the
door
for
not
only
was
the
life
of
the
king
in
question
but
as
the
whole
court
knew
well
the
chancellor
the
and
her
adherents
were
in
the
utmost
danger
a
deep
silence
fell
on
the
whole
assembly
ambroise
pare
had
by
this
time
examined
the
king
s
head
he
thought
the
moment
propitious
for
his
operation
if
it
was
not
performed
suffusion
would
take
place
and
francois
ii
might
die
at
any
moment
as
soon
as
the
duke
and
cardinal
entered
the
chamber
he
explained
to
all
present
that
in
so
urgent
a
case
it
was
necessary
to
trepan
the
head
and
he
now
waited
till
the
king
s
physician
ordered
him
to
perform
the
operation
cut
the
head
of
my
son
as
though
it
were
a
plank
with
that
horrible
instrument
cried
catherine
de
medici
maitre
ambroise
i
will
not
permit
the
physicians
were
consulting
together
but
catherine
spoke
in
so
loud
a
voice
that
her
words
reached
as
she
intended
they
should
beyond
the
door
but
madame
if
there
is
no
other
way
to
save
him
said
mary
stuart
weeping
ambroise
cried
catherine
remember
that
your
head
will
answer
for
the
king
s
we
are
opposed
to
the
treatment
suggested
by
maitre
ambroise
said
the
three
physicians
the
king
can
be
saved
by
injecting
through
the
ear
a
remedy
which
will
draw
the
contents
of
the
abscess
through
that
the
duc
de
guise
who
was
watching
catherine
s
face
suddenly
went
up
to
her
and
drew
her
into
the
recess
of
the
window
madame
he
said
you
wish
the
death
of
your
son
you
are
in
league
with
our
enemies
and
have
been
since
blois
this
morning
the
counsellor
viole
told
the
son
of
your
furrier
that
the
prince
de
conde
s
head
was
about
to
be
cut
off
that
young
man
who
when
the
question
was
applied
persisted
in
denying
all
relations
with
the
prince
made
a
sign
of
farewell
to
him
as
he
passed
before
the
window
of
his
dungeon
you
saw
your
unhappy
accomplice
tortured
with
royal
insensibility
you
are
now
endeavoring
to
prevent
the
recovery
of
your
eldest
son
your
conduct
forces
us
to
believe
that
the
death
of
the
dauphin
which
placed
the
crown
on
your
husband
s
head
was
not
a
natural
one
and
that
montecuculi
was
your
monsieur
le
chancilier
cried
catherine
at
a
sign
from
whom
madame
de
fiesque
opened
both
sides
of
the
bedroom
door
the
company
in
the
hall
then
saw
the
scene
that
was
taking
place
in
the
royal
chamber
the
livid
little
king
his
face
half
dead
his
eyes
sightless
his
lips
stammering
the
word
mary
as
he
held
the
hand
of
the
weeping
queen
the
duchesse
de
guise
motionless
frightened
by
catherine
s
daring
act
the
duke
and
cardinal
also
alarmed
keeping

as
the

s
mother
and
a
member
of
the
council
of
the

i
protest
against
what
appears
to
me
a
crime
of
the
king
s
physicians
advise
an
injection
through
the
ear
which
seems
to
me
as
efficacious
and
less
dangerous
than
the
brutal
operation
proposed
by
when
the
company
in
the
hall
heard
these
words
a
smothered
murmur

from
their
midst

cardinal

the
chancellor
to
enter

then
he
closed

if
you
employ
violence
either
upon
the
king
or
upon

that
enough
of
the
nobility
of

are
in
that
hall
to
rise
and
arrest
you
as

the

when

he
was
terrified

whole

my

was
carrying

of
my

an

it
is
my
duty
to
submit
to
their

later
l

boldly
opened
the
door
of
the

arrive
in
good
time
said
the
voice
of
a
man
whose
hasty
steps
echoed
through
the
great
hall
and
who
stood
the
next
moment
on
the
threshold
of
the
open
door
ah
messieurs
so
you
meant
to
take
off
the
head
of
my
good
nephew
the
prince
de
conde
instead
of
that
you
have
forced
the
lion
from
his
lair
and
here
i
am
added
the
connetable
de
montmorency
ambroise
you
shall
not
plunge
your
knife
into
the
head
of
my
king
the
first
prince
of

antoine
de

the
prince
de

the
the
connetable
and
the
chancellor
forbid
the
to
catherine
s
great
satisfaction
the
king
of
navarre
and
the
prince
de
conde
now
entered
the
room
what
does
this
mean
said
the
duc
de
guise
laying
his
hand
on
his
dagger
it
means
that
in
my
capacity
as
connetable
i
have
dismissed
the
sentinels
of
all
your
posts
you
are
not
in
an
enemy
s
country
methinks
the
king
our
master
is
in
the
midst
of
his
loyal
subjects
and
the
must
be
suffered
to
deliberate
at
liberty
i
come
messieurs
from
the
i
carried
the
protest
of
my
nephew
de
conde
before
that
assembly
and
three
hundred
of
those
gentlemen
have
released
him
you
wish
to
shed
royal
blood
and
to
decimate
the
nobility
of
the
kingdom
do
you
ha
in
future
i
defy
you
and
all
your
schemes
messieurs
de
lorraine
if
you
order
the
king
s
head
opened
by
this
sword
which
saved
france
from
charles
i
say
it
shall
not
be
done
all
the
more
said
ambroise
pare
because
it
is
now
too
late
the
suffusion

said
catherine
to
the

seeing
from

that
there
was
no

ah
madame
you
have
killed
your
own
son
cried
mary
stuart
as
she
bounded
like
a
lioness
from
the
bed
to
the
window
and
seized
the
by
the
arm
gripping
it
violently
my
dear
replied
catherine
giving
her
a
cold
keen
glance
in
which
she
allowed
her
hatred
repressed
for
the
last
six
months
to
overflow
you
to
whose
inordinate
love
we
owe
this
death
you
will
now
go
to
reign
in
your
scotland
and
you
will
start

the
three
physicians
having
made
her
a
sign
messieurs
she
added
addressing
the
guises
it
is
agreed
between
monsieur
de
bourbon
appointed
of

by
the
and
me
that
the
conduct
of
the

the

cried
all
the
noblemen
who
had
come
with
the
king
of
navarre
the
prince
de
conde
and
the
connetable
the
ceremonies
which
follow
the
death
of
a
king
of
france
were
performed
in
almost
total
solitude
when
the
proclaimed
aloud
three
times
in
the
hall
the
king
is
dead
there
were
very
few
persons
present
to
reply
vive

the
to
whom
the
comtesse
de

had
brought
the

all
the
remaining
courtiers

several
reformers
in
the
street
sounding
the
first
cry
of
the
opposition
robertet
who
owed
all
he
was
to
the
duke
and
cardinal
terrified
by
their
scheme
and
its
present
failure
went
over
secretly
to
the
whom
the
ambassadors
of
spain
england
the
empire
and
poland
hastened
to
meet
on
the
staircase
brought
thither
by
cardinal
de

had
gone
to
notify
them
as
soon
as
he
had
made
queen
catherine

from
the
courtyard
at
the
moment
when
she
protested
against

the
cardinal
to
the

the
sons
of

the

flinched
and
lacked

replied
the

declare
to
you
charles
that
if
the
crown

would
not

out

exclaimed
mary
stuart
clasping
the
stiffened
hand
of
her
first
husband
now
dead
there
is
none
but
me
to
weep
for
this
poor
boy
who
loved
me
so
how
can
we
patch
up
matters
with
the
said
the
cardinal
wait
till
she
quarrels
with
the
huguenots
replied
the
duchess
the
conflicting
interests
of
the
house
of
bourbon
of
catherine
of
the
guises
and
of
the
reformed
party
produced
such
confusion
in
the
town
of
orleans
that
three
days
after
the
king
s
death
his
body
completely
forgotten
in
the
bailliage
and
put
into
a
coffin
by
the
menials
of
the
house
was
taken
to
in
a
covered
waggon
accompanied
only
by
the
bishop
of
senlis
and
two
gentlemen
when
the
pitiable
procession
reached
the
little
town
of
etampes
a
servant
of
the
chancelier
l
hopital
fastened
to
the
waggon
this
severe
inscription
which
history
has
preserved
tanneguy
de
chastel
where
art
thou
and
yet
thou
wert
a
frenchman
a
stern
reproach
which
fell
with
equal
force
on
catherine
de
medici
mary
stuart
and
the
guises
what
frenchman
does
not
know
that
tanneguy
de
chastel
spent
thirty
thousand
crowns
of
the
coinage
of
that
day
one
million
of
our
francs
at
the
funeral
of
charles
the
benefactor
of
his
house
no
sooner
did
the
tolling
of
the
bells
announce
to
the
town
of
orleans
that
francois
ii
was
dead
and
the
rumor
spread
that
the
connetable
de
montmorency
had
ordered
the
flinging
open
of
the
gates
of
the
town
than
tourillon
the
glover
rushed
up
into
the
garret
of
his
house
and
went
to
a
secret
good
heavens
can
he
be
dead
he
cried
hearing
the
words
a
man
rose
to
his
feet
and
answered
ready
to
serve
the
password
of
the
reformers
who
belonged
to
calvin
this
man
was
chaudieu
to
whom
tourillon
now
related
the
events
of
the
last
eight
days
during
which
time
he
had
prudently
left
the
minister
alone
in
his
with
a
loaf
of
bread
for
his
sole
nourishment
go
instantly
to
the
prince
de
conde
brother
ask
him
to
give
me
a
and
find
me
a
horse
cried
the
minister
i
must
start
at
write
me
a
line
or
he
will
not
receive
here
said
chaudieu
after
writing
a
few
words
ask
for
a
pass
from
the
king
of
navarre
for
i
must
go
to
geneva
without
a
moment
s
loss
of
xiii
calvin
two
hours
later
all
was
ready
and
the
ardent
minister
was
on
his
way
to
switzerland
accompanied
by
a
nobleman
in
the
service
of
the
king
of
navarre
of
whom
chaudieu
pretended
to
be
the
secretary
carrying
with
him
despatches
from
the
reformers
in
the
dauphine
this
sudden
departure
was
chiefly
in
the
interests
of
catherine
de
medici
who
in
order
to
gain
time
to
establish
her
power
had
made
a
bold
proposition
to
the
reformers
which
was
kept
a
profound
secret
this
strange
proceeding
explains
the
understanding
so
suddenly
apparent
between
herself
and
the
leaders
of
the
reform
the
wily
woman
gave
as
a
pledge
of
her
good
faith
an
intimation
of
her
desire
to
heal
all
differences
between
the
two
churches
by
calling
an
assembly
which
should
be
neither
a
council
nor
a
conclave
nor
a
synod
but
should
be
known
by
some
new
and
distinctive
name
if
calvin
consented
to
the
project
when
this
secret
was
afterwards
divulged
be
it
remarked
in
passing
it
led
to
an
alliance
between
the
duc
de
guise
and
the
connetable
de
montmorency
against
catherine
and
the
king
of
navarre
a
strange
alliance
known
in
history
as
the
triumvirate
the
marechal
de
being
the
third
personage
in
the
purely
catholic
coalition
to
which
this
singular
proposition
for
a
colloquy
gave
rise
the
secret
of
catherine
s
wily
policy
was
rightly
understood
by
the
guises
they
felt
certain
that
the
queen
cared
nothing
for
this
mysterious
assembly
and
was
only
temporizing
with
her
new
allies
in
order
to
secure
a
period
of
peace
until
the
majority
of
charles
ix
but
none
the
less
did
they
deceive
the
connetable
into
fearing
a
collusion
of
real
interests
between
the
queen
and
the
bourbons
whereas
in
reality
catherine
was
playing
them
all
one
against
another
the
queen
had
become
as
the
reader
will
perceive
extremely
powerful
in
a
very
short
time
the
spirit
of
discussion
and
controversy
which
now
sprang
up
was
singularly
favorable
to
her
position
the
catholics
and
the
reformers
were
equally
pleased
to
exhibit
their
brilliancy
one
after
another
in
this
tournament
of
words
for
that
is
what
it
actually
was
and
no
more
it
is
extraordinary
that
historians
have
mistaken
one
of
the
wiliest
schemes
of
the
great
queen
for
uncertainty
and
hesitation
catherine
never
went
more
directly
to
her
own
ends
than
in
just
such
schemes
which
appeared
to
thwart
them
the
king
of
navarre
quite
incapable
of
understanding
her
motives
fell
into
her
plan
in
all
sincerity
and
despatched
chaudieu
to
calvin
as
we
have
seen
the
minister
had
risked
his
life
to
be
secretly
in
orleans
and
watch
events
for
he
was
while
there
in
hourly
peril
of
being
discovered
and
hung
as
a
man
under
sentence
of
banishment
according
to
the
then
fashion
of
travelling
chaudieu
could
not
reach
geneva
before
the
month
of
february
and
the
negotiations
were
not
likely
to
be
concluded
before
the
end
of
march
consequently
the
assembly
could
certainly
not
take
place
before
the
month
of
may
catherine
meantime
intended
to
amuse
the
court
and
the
various
conflicting
interests
by
the
coronation
of
the
king
and
the
ceremonies
of
his
first
lit
de
justice
at
which
l
hopital
and
de
thou
recorded
the
by
which
charles
ix
confided
the
administration
to
his
mother
in
common
with
the
present
of
the
kingdom
antoine
de
navarre
the
weakest
prince
of
those
days
is
it
not
a
strange
spectacle
this
of
the
great
kingdom
of
france
waiting
in
suspense
for
the
yes
or
no
of
a
french
burgher
hitherto
an
obscure
man
living
for
many
years
past
in
geneva
the
transalpine
pope
held
in
check
by
the
pontiff
of
geneva
the
two
lorrain
princes
lately
now
paralyzed
by
the
momentary
coalition
of
the
and
the
first
prince
of
the
blood
with
calvin
is
not
this
i
say
one
of
the
most
instructive
lessons
ever
given
to
kings
by
history
a
lesson
which
should
teach
them
to
study
men
to
seek
out
genius
and
employ
it
as
did
louis
wherever
god
has
placed
it
calvin
whose
name
was
not
calvin
but
cauvin
was
the
son
of
a
cooper
at
noyon
in
picardy
the
region
of
his
birth
explains
in
some
degree
the
obstinacy
combined
with
capricious
eagerness
which
distinguished
this
arbiter
of
the
destinies
of
france
in
the
sixteenth
century
nothing
is
less
known
than
the
nature
of
this
man
who
gave
birth
to
geneva
and
to
the
spirit
that
emanated
from
that
city
rousseau
who
had
very
little
historical
knowledge
has
completely
ignored
the
influence
of
calvin
on
his
republic
at
first
the
embryo
reformer
who
lived
in
one
of
the
humblest
houses
in
the
upper
town
near
the
church
of
over
a
carpenter
s

first
resemblance
between
him
and
robespierre
had
no
great
authority
in
geneva
in
fact
for
a
long
time
his
power
was
malevolently
checked
by
the
genevese
the
town
was
the
residence
in
those
days
of
a
citizen
whose
fame
like
that
of
several
others
remained
unknown
to
the
world
at
large
and
for
a
time
to
geneva
itself
this
man
farel
about
the
year
detained
calvin
in
geneva
pointing
out
to
him
that
the
place
could
be
made
the
safe
centre
of
a
reformation
more
active
and
thorough
than
that
of
luther
farel
and
calvin
regarded
lutheranism
as
an
incomplete
work
insufficient
in
itself
and
without
any
real
grip
upon
france
geneva
midway
between
france
and
italy
and
speaking
the
french
language
was
admirably
situated
for
ready
communication
with
germany
france
and
italy
calvin
thereupon
adopted
geneva
as
the
site
of
his
moral
fortunes
he
made
it
thenceforth
the
citadel
of
his
ideas
the
council
of
geneva
at
farel
s
entreaty
authorized
calvin
in
september
to
give
lectures
on
theology
calvin
left
the
duties
of
the
ministry
to
farel
his
first
disciple
and
gave
himself
up
patiently
to
the
work
of
teaching
his
doctrine
his
authority
which
became
so
absolute
in
the
last
years
of
his
life
was
obtained
with
difficulty
and
very
slowly
the
great
agitator
met
with
such
serious
obstacles
that
he
was
banished
for
a
time
from
geneva
on
account
of
the
severity
of
his
reform
a
party
of
honest
citizens
still
clung
to
their
old
luxury
and
their
old
customs
but
as
usually
happens
these
good
people
fearing
ridicule
would
not
admit
the
real
object
of
their
efforts
and
kept
up
their
warfare
against
the
new
doctrines
on
points
altogether
foreign
to
the
real
question
calvin
insisted
that
should
be
used
for
the
communion
and
that
all
feasts
should
be
abolished
except
sundays
these
innovations
were
disapproved
of
at
berne
and
at
lausanne
notice
was
served
on
the
genevese
to
conform
to
the
ritual
of
switzerland
calvin
and
farel
resisted
their
political
opponents
used
this
disobedience
to
drive
them
from
geneva
whence
they
were
in
fact
banished
for
several
years
later
calvin
returned
triumphantly
at
the
demand
of
his
flock
such
persecutions
always
become
in
the
end
the
consecration
of
a
moral
power
and
in
this
case
calvin
s
return
was
the
beginning
of
his
era
as
prophet
he
then
organized
his
religious
terror
and
the
executions
began
on
his
reappearance
in
the
city
he
was
admitted
into
the
ranks
of
the
genevese
burghers
but
even
then
after
fourteen
years
residence
he
was
not
made
a
member
of
the
council
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
when
catherine
sent
her
envoy
to
him
this
king
of
ideas
had
no
other
title
than
that
of
pastor
of
the
church
of
moreover
calvin
never
in
his
life
received
a
salary
of
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
francs
in
money
yearly
fifteen
of
wheat
and
two
barrels
of
wine
his
brother
a
tailor
kept
a
shop
close
to
the
place
in
a
street
now
occupied
by
one
of
the
large
printing
establishments
of
geneva
such
personal
disinterestedness
which
was
lacking
in
voltaire
newton
and
bacon
but
eminent
in
the
lives
of
rabelais
spinosa
loyola
kant
and
rousseau
is
indeed
a
magnificent
frame
to
those
ardent
and
sublime
figures
the
career
of
robespierre
can
alone
picture
to
the
minds
of
the
present
day
that
of
calvin
who
founding
his
power
on
the
same
bases
was
as
despotic
and
as
cruel
as
the
lawyer
of
arras
it
is
a
noticeable
fact
that
picardy
arras
and
noyon
furnished
both
these
instruments
of
reformation
persons
who
wish
to
study
the
motives
of
the

by
calvin

yourselves

their
saturnalias

more
ignominious

catholic

seven
years
before

a

which
was
neither

from

he
had
endeavored
to
destroy
the
fundamental

of

and
of
authority

the

of

for

these
things
and
ask
yourselves
if
did
worse
the
savage
religious
intolerance
of
calvin
was
morally
speaking
more
implacable
than
the
savage
political
intolerance
of
robespierre
on
a
larger
stage
than
that
of
geneva
calvin
would
have
shed
more
blood
than
did
the
terrible
apostle
of
political
equality
as
opposed
to
catholic
equality
three
centuries
earlier
a
monk
of
picardy
drove
the
whole
west
upon
the
east
peter
the
hermit
calvin
and
robespierre
each
at
an
interval
of
three
hundred
years
and
all
three
from
the
same
region
were
politically
speaking
the
archimedean
screws
of
their
age
at
each
epoch
a
thought
which
found
its
fulcrum
in
the
of
mankind
calvin
was
undoubtedly
the
maker
of
that
melancholy
town
called
geneva
where
only
ten
years
ago
a
man
said
pointing
to
a
in
the
upper
town
the
first
ever
built
there
by
that
door
luxury
has
invaded
calvin
gave
birth
by
the
sternness
of
his
doctrines
and
his
executions
to
that
form
of
hypocritical
sentiment
called
according
to
those
who
practice
it
good
morals
consist
in
renouncing
the
arts
and
the
charms
of
life
in
eating
richly
but
without
luxury
in
silently
amassing
money
without
enjoying
it
otherwise
than
as
calvin
enjoyed
power
by
thought
calvin
imposed
on
all
the
citizens
of
his
adopted
town
the
same
gloomy
pall
which
he
spread
over
his
own
life
he
created
in
the
consistory
a
calvinistic
inquisition
absolutely
similar
to
the
revolutionary
tribunal
of
robespierre
the
consistory
denounced
the
persons
to
be
condemned
to
the
council
and
calvin
ruled
the
council
through
the
consistory
just
as
robespierre
ruled
the
convention
through
the
club
of
the
jacobins
in
this
way
an
eminent
magistrate
of
geneva
was
condemned
to
two
months
imprisonment
the
loss
of
all
his
offices
and
the
right
of
ever
obtaining
others
because
he
led
a
disorderly
life
and
was
intimate
with
calvin
s
calvin
thus
became
a
legislator
he
created
the
austere
sober
commonplace
and
hideously
sad
but
irreproachable
manners
and
customs
which
characterize
geneva
to
the
present
day
customs
preceding
those
of
england
called
puritanism
which
were
due
to
the
cameronians
disciples
of
cameron
a
frenchman
deriving
his
doctrine
from
calvin
whom
sir
walter
scott
depicts
so
admirably
the
poverty
of
a
man
a
sovereign
master
who
negotiated
power
to
power
with
kings
demanding
armies
and
subsidies
and
plunging
both
hands
into
their
savings
laid
aside
for
the
unfortunate
proves
that
thought
used
solely
as
a
means
of
domination
gives
birth
to
political
misers
men
who
enjoy
by
their
brains
only
and
like
the
jesuits
want
power
for
power
s
sake
pitt
luther
calvin
robespierre
all
those
harpagons
of
power
died
without
a
penny
the
inventory
taken
in
calvin
s
house
after
his
death
which
comprised
all
his
property
even
his
books
amounted
in
value
as
history
records
to
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs
that
of
luther
came
to
about
the
same
sum
his
widow
the
famous
catherine
de
bora
was
forced
to
petition
for
a
pension
of
five
hundred
francs
which
as
granted
to
her
by
an
elector
of
germany

richelieu
mazarin
those
men
of
thought
and
action
all
three
of
whom
made
or
laid
the
foundation
of
empires
each
left
over
three
hundred
millions
behind
them
they
had
hearts
they
loved
women
and
the
arts
they
built
they
conquered
whereas
with
the
exception
of
the
wife
of
luther
the
helen
of
that
iliad
all
the
others
had
no
tenderness
no
beating
of
the
heart
for
any
woman
with
which
to
reproach
themselves
this
brief
digression
was
necessary
in
order
to
explain
calvin
s
position
in
geneva
during
the
first
days
of
the
month
of
february
in
the
year
on
a
soft
warm
evening
such
as
we
may
sometimes
find
at
that
season
on
lake
leman
two
horsemen
arrived
at
the
eveque
thus
called
because
it
was
the
former
of
the
bishop
of
geneva
driven
from
switzerland
about
thirty
years
earlier
these
horsemen
who
no
doubt
knew
the
laws
of
geneva
about
the
closing
of
the
gates
then
a
necessity
and
now
very
ridiculous
rode
in
the
direction
of
the
porte
de
rive
but
they
stopped
their
horses
suddenly
on
catching
sight
of
a
man
about
fifty
years
of
age
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
and
walking
slowly
toward
the
town
this
man
who
was
rather
stout
walked
with
difficulty
putting
one
foot
after
the
other
with
pain
apparently
for
he
wore
round
shoes
of
black
velvet
laced
in
front
it
is
he
said
chaudieu
to
the
other
horseman
who
immediately
dismounted
threw
the
reins
to
his
companion
and
went
forward
opening
wide
his
arms
to
the
man
on
foot
the
man
who
was
jean
calvin
drew
back
to
avoid
the
embrace
casting
a
stern
look
at
his
disciple
at
fifty
years
of
age
calvin
looked
as
though
he
were
sixty
stout
and
stocky
in
figure
he
seemed
shorter
still
because
the
horrible
sufferings
of
stone
in
the
bladder
obliged
him
to
bend
almost
double
as
he
walked
these
pains
were
complicated
by
attacks
of
gout
of
the
worst
kind
every
one
trembled
before
that
face
almost
as
broad
as
it
was
long
on
which
in
spite
of
its
roundness
there
was
as
little
as
on
that
of
henry
the
eighth
whom
calvin
greatly
resembled
sufferings
which
gave
him
no
respite
were
manifest
in
the
lines
starting
from
each
side
of
the
nose
and
following
the
curve
of
the
moustache
till
they
were
lost
in
the
thick
gray
beard
this
face
though
red
and
inflamed
like
that
of
a
heavy
drinker
showed
spots
where
the
skin
was
yellow
in
spite
of
the
velvet
cap
which
covered
the
huge
square
head
a
vast
forehead
of
noble
shape
could
be
seen
and
admired
beneath
it
shone
two
dark
eyes
which
must
have
flashed
forth
flame
in
moments
of
anger
whether
by
reason
of
his
obesity
or
because
of
his
thick
short
neck
or
in
consequence
of
his
vigils
and
his
constant
labors
calvin
s
head
was
sunk
between
his
broad
shoulders
which
obliged
him
to
wear
a
fluted
ruff
of
very
small
dimensions
on
which
his
face
seemed
to
lie
like
the
head
of
john
the
baptist
on
a
charger
between
his
moustache
and
his
beard
could
be
seen
like
a
rose
his
small
and
fresh
and
eloquent
little
mouth
shaped
in
perfection
the
face
was
divided
by
a
square
nose
remarkable
for
the
flexibility
of
its
entire
length
the
tip
of
which
was
significantly
flat
seeming
the
more
in
harmony
with
the
prodigious
power
expressed
by
the
form
of
that
imperial
head
though
it
might
have
been
difficult
to
discover
on
his
features
any
trace
of
the
weekly
headaches
which
tormented
calvin
in
the
intervals
of
the
slow
fever
that
consumed
him
suffering
ceaselessly
resisted
by
study
and
by
will
gave
to
that
mask
superficially
so
florid
a
certain
something
that
was
terrible
perhaps
this
impression
was
explainable
by
the
color
of
a
sort
of
greasy
layer
on
the
skin
due
to
the
sedentary
habits
of
the
toiler
showing
evidence
of
the
perpetual
struggle
which
went
on
between
that
valetudinarian
temperament
and
one
of
the
strongest
wills
ever
known
in
the
history
of
the
human
mind
the
mouth
though
charming
had
an
expression
of
cruelty
chastity
necessitated
by
vast
designs
exacted
by
so
many
sickly
conditions
was
written
upon
that
face
regrets
were
there
notwithstanding
the
serenity
of
that
brow
together
with
pain
in
the
glance
of
those
eyes
the
calmness
of
which
was
terrifying
calvin
s
costume
brought
into
full
relief
this
powerful
head
he
wore
the
cassock
of
black
cloth
fastened
round
his
waist
by
a
black
cloth
belt
with
a
brass
buckle
which
became
thenceforth
the
distinctive
dress
of
all
calvinist
ministers
and
was
so
uninteresting
to
the
eye
that
it
forced
the
spectator
s
attention
upon
the
wearer
s
face
i
suffer
too
much
theodore
to
embrace
you
said
calvin
to
the
elegant
cavalier
theodore
de
beze
then
years
of
age
and
lately
admitted
at
calvin
s
request
as
a
genevese
burgher
formed
a
violent
contrast
to
the
terrible
pastor
whom
he
had
chosen
as
his
sovereign
guide
and
ruler
calvin
like
all
burghers
raised
to
moral
sovereignty
and
all
inventors
of
social
systems
was
eaten
up
with
jealousy
he
abhorred
his
disciples
he
wanted
no
equals
he
could
not
bear
the
slightest
contradiction
yet
there
was
between
him
and
this
graceful
cavalier
so
marked
a
difference
theodore
de
beze
was
gifted
with
so
charming
a
personality
enhanced
by
a
politeness
trained
by
court
life
and
calvin
felt
him
to
be
so
unlike
his
other
surly
janissaries
that
the
stern
reformer
departed
in
de
beze
s
case
from
his
usual
habits
he
never
loved
him
for
this
harsh
legislator
totally
ignored
all
friendship
but
not
fearing
him
in
the
light
of
a
successor
he
liked
to
play
with
theodore
as
richelieu
played
with
his
cat
he
found
him
supple
and
agile
seeing
how
admirably
de
beze
succeeded
in
all
his
missions
he
took
a
fancy
to
the
polished
instrument
of
which
he
knew
himself
the
mainspring
and
the
manipulator
so
true
is
it
that
the
sternest
of
men
can
not
do
without
some
semblance
of
affection
theodore
was
calvin
s
spoilt
child
the
harsh
reformer
never
scolded
him
he
forgave
him
his
dissipations
his
amours
his
fine
clothes
and
his
elegance
of
language
perhaps
calvin
was
not
unwilling
to
show
that
the
reformation
had
a
few
men
of
the
world
to
compare
with
the
men
of
the
court
theodore
de
beze
was
anxious
to
introduce
a
taste
for
the
arts
for
literature
and
for
poesy
into
geneva
and
calvin
listened
to
his
plans
without
knitting
his
thick
gray
eyebrows
thus
the
contrast
of
character
and
person
between
these
two
celebrated
men
was
as
complete
and
marked
as
the
difference
in
their
minds
calvin
acknowledged
chaudieu
s
very
humble
salutation
by
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head
chaudieu
slipped
the
bridles
of
both
horses
through
his
arms
and
followed
the
two
great
men
of
the
reformation
walking
to
the
left
behind
de
beze
who
was
on
calvin
s
right
the
hastened
on
in
advance
to
prevent
the
closing
of
the
porte
de
rive
by
informing
the
captain
of
the
guard
that
calvin
had
been
seized
with
sudden
acute
pains
theodore
de
beze
was
a
native
of
the
canton
of
vezelay
which
was
the
first
to
enter
the
confederation
the
curious
history
of
which
transaction
has
been
written
by
one
of
the
thierrys
the
burgher
spirit
of
resistance
endemic
at
vezelay
no
doubt
played
its
part
in
the
person
of
this
man
in
the
great
revolt
of
the
reformers
for
de
beze
was
undoubtedly
one
of
the
most
singular
personalities
of
the
heresy
you
suffer
still
said
theodore
to
calvin
a
catholic
would
say
like
a
lost
soul
replied
the
reformer
with
the
bitterness
he
gave
to
his
slightest
remarks
ah
i
shall
not
be
here
long
my
son
what
will
become
of
you
without
me
we
shall
fight
by
the
light
of
your
books
said
chaudieu
calvin
smiled
his
red
face
changed
to
a
pleased
expression
and
he
looked
favorably
at
chaudieu
well
have
you
brought
me
news
have
they
massacred
many
of
our
people
he
said
smiling
and
letting
a
sarcastic
joy
shine
in
his
brown
eyes
no
said
chaudieu
all
is
so
much
the
worse
cried
calvin
so
much
the
worse
all
pacification
is
an
evil
if
indeed
it
is
not
a
trap
our
strength
lies
in
persecution
where
should
we
be
if
the
church
accepted
reform
but
said
theodore
that
is
precisely
what
the
appears
to
she
is
capable
of
it
remarked
calvin
i
study
that
woman
what
at
this
distance
cried
chaudieu
is
there
any
distance
for
the
mind
replied
calvin
sternly
for
he
thought
the
interruption
irreverent
catherine
seeks
power
and
women
with
that
in
their
eye
have
neither
honor
nor
faith
but
what
is
she
doing
now
i
bring
you
a
proposal
from
her
to
call
a
species
of
council
replied
theodore
de
beze
near
paris
asked
calvin
hastily
ha
so
much
the
better
exclaimed
the
reformer
we
are
to
try
to
understand
each
other
and
draw
up
some
public
agreement
which
shall
unite
the
two
ah
if
she
would
only
have
the
courage
to
separate
the
french
church
from
the
court
of
rome
and
create
a
patriarch
for
france
as
they
did
in
the
greek
church
cried
calvin
his
eyes
glistening
at
the
idea
thus
presented
to
his
mind
of
a
possible
throne
but
my
son
can
the
niece
of
a
pope
be
sincere
she
is
only
trying
to
gain
she
has
sent
away
the
queen
of
scots
said
chaudieu
one
less
remarked
calvin
as
they
passed
through
the
porte
de
rive
elizabeth
of
england
will
restrain
that
one
for
us
two
neighboring
queens
will
soon
be
at
war
with
each
other
one
is
handsome
the
other
ugly
a
first
cause
for
irritation
besides
there
s
the
question
of
illegitimacy
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
the
character
of
his
joy
was
so
evidently
ferocious
that
de
beze
shuddered
he
saw
the
sea
of
blood
his
master
was
contemplating
the
guises
have
irritated
the
house
of
bourbon
said
theodore
after
a
pause
they
came
to
an
open
rupture
at
ah
said
calvin
you
would
not
believe
me
my
son
when
i
told
you
the
last
time
you
started
for
nerac
that
we
should
end
by
stirring
up
war
to
the
death
between
the
two
branches
of
the
house
of
france
i
have
at
least
one
court
one
king
and
royal
family
on
my
side
my
doctrine
is
producing
its
effect
upon
the
masses
the
burghers
too
understand
me
they
regard
as
idolators
all
who
go
to
mass
who
paint
the
walls
of
their
churches
and
put
pictures
and
statues
within
them
ha
it
is
far
more
easy
for
a
people
to
demolish
churches
and
palaces
than
to
argue
the
question
of
justification
by
faith
or
the
real
presence
luther
was
an
argufier
but
i
i
am
an
army
he
was
a
reasoner
i
am
a
system
in
short
my
sons
he
was
merely
a
skirmisher
but
i
am
tarquin
yes
faithful
shall
destroy
pictures
and
pull
down
churches
they
shall
make
of
statues
to
grind
the
flour
of
the
peoples
there
are
guilds
and
corporations
in
the
i
will
have
nothing
there
but
individuals
corporations
resist
they
see
clear
where
the
masses
are
blind
we
must
join
to
our
doctrine
political
interests
which
will
consolidate
it
and
keep
together
the
of
my
armies
i
have
satisfied
the
logic
of
cautious
souls
and
the
minds
of
thinkers
by
this
bared
and
naked
worship
which
carries
religion
into
the
world
of
ideas
i
have
made
the
peoples
understand
the
advantages
of
suppressing
ceremony
it
is
for
you
theodore
to
enlist
their
interests
hold
to
that
go
not
beyond
it
all
is
said
in
the
way
of
doctrine
let
no
one
add
one
iota
why
does
cameron
that
little
gascon
pastor
presume
to
write
of
it
calvin
de
beze
and
chaudieu
were
mounting
the
steep
steps
of
the
upper
town
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
but
the
crowd
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
the
men
who
were
unchaining
the
mobs
of
other
cities
and
preparing
them
to
ravage
france
after
this
terrible
tirade
the
three
marched
on
in
silence
till
they
entered
the
little
place
and
turned
toward
the
pastor
s
house
on
the
second
story
of
that
house
never
noted
and
of
which
in
these
days
no
one
is
ever
told
in
geneva
where
it
may
be
remarked
calvin
has
no
statue
his
lodging
consisted
of
three
chambers
with
common
pine
floors
and
wainscots
at
the
end
of
which
were
the
kitchen
and
the
bedroom
of
his
the
entrance
as
usually
happened
in
most
of
the
burgher
households
of
geneva
was
through
the
kitchen
which
opened
into
a
little
room
with
two
windows
serving
as
parlor
salon
and
calvin
s
study
where
his
thought
had
wrestled
with
suffering
for
the
last
fourteen
years
came
next
with
the
bedroom
beyond
it
four
oaken
chairs
covered
with
tapestry
and
placed
around
a
square
table
were
the
sole
furniture
of
the
parlor
a
stove
of
white
porcelain
standing
in
one
corner
of
the
room
cast
out
a
gentle
heat
panels
and
a
wainscot
of
pine
wood
left
in
its
natural
state
without
decoration
covered
the
walls
thus
the
nakedness
of
the
place
was
in
keeping
with
the
sober
and
simple
life
of
the
reformer
well
said
de
beze
as
they
entered
profiting
by
a
few
moments
when
chaudieu
left
them
to
put
up
the
horse
at
a
neighboring
inn
what
am
i
to
do
will
you
agree
to
the
colloquy
of
course
replied
calvin
and
it
is
you
my
son
who
will
fight
for
us
there
be
peremptory
be
arbitrary
no
one
neither
the
queen
nor
the
guises
nor
i
wants
a
pacification
it
would
not
suit
us
at
all
i
have
confidence
in
let
him
play
the
leading
part
are
we
alone
he
added
with
a
glance
of
distrust
into
the
kitchen
where
two
shirts
and
a
few
collars
were
stretched
on
a
line
to
dry
go
and
shut
all
the
doors
well
he
continued
when
theodore
had
returned
we
must
drive
the
king
of
navarre
to
join
the
guises
and
the
connetable
by
advising
him
to
break
with
queen
catherine
de
medici
let
us
all
get
the
benefit
of
that
poor
creature
s
weakness
if
he
turns
against
the
italian
she
will
when
she
sees
herself
deprived
of
that
support
necessarily
unite
with
the
prince
de
conde
and
coligny
perhaps
this
manoeuvre
will
so
compromise
her
that
she
will
be
forced
to
remain
on
our
theodore
de
beze
caught
the
hem
of
calvin
s
cassock
and
kissed
it
oh
my
master
he
exclaimed
how
great
you
are
unfortunately
my
dear
theodore
i
am
dying
if
i
die
without
seeing
you
again
he
added
sinking
his
voice
and
speaking
in
the
ear
of
his
minister
of
foreign
affairs
remember
to
strike
a
great
blow
by
the
hand
of
some
one
of
our
another
minard
to
be
killed
something
better
than
a
mere
a
king
still
better
a
man
who
wants
to
be
a
the
duc
de
guise
exclaimed
theodore
with
an
involuntary
gesture
well
cried
calvin
who
thought
he
saw
disappointment
or
resistance
in
the
gesture
and
did
not
see
at
the
same
moment
the
entrance
of
chaudieu
have
we
not
the
right
to
strike
as
we
are
struck
yes
to
strike
in
silence
and
in
darkness
may
we
not
return
them
wound
for
wound
and
death
for
death
would
the
catholics
hesitate
to
lay
traps
for
us
and
massacre
us
assuredly
not
let
us
burn
their
churches
forward
my
children
and
if
you
have
devoted
youths
i
have
said
chaudieu
use
them
as
engines
of
war
our
cause
justifies
all
means
le
balafre
that
horrible
soldier
is
like
me
more
than
a
man
he
is
a
dynasty
just
as
i
am
a
system
he
is
able
to
annihilate
us
therefore
i
say
death
to
the
guise
i
would
rather
have
a
peaceful
victory
won
by
time
and
reason
said
de
beze
time
exclaimed
calvin
dashing
his
chair
to
the
ground
reason
are
you
mad
can
reason
achieve
conquests
you
know
nothing
of
men
you
who
deal
with
them
idiot
the
thing
that
injures
my
doctrine
you
triple
fool
is
the
reason
that
is
in
it
by
the
lightning
of
saul
by
the
sword
of
vengeance
thou
do
you
not
see
the
vigor
given
to
my
reform
by
the
massacre
at
amboise
ideas
never
grow
till
they
are
watered
with
blood
the
slaying
of
the
duc
de
guise
will
lead
to
a
horrible
persecution
and
i
pray
for
it
with
all
my
might
our
reverses
are
preferable
to
success
the
reformation
has
an
object
to
gain
in
being
attacked
do
you
hear
me
dolt
it
can
not
hurt
us
to
be
defeated
whereas
catholicism
is
at
an
end
if
we
should
win
but
a
single
battle
ha
what
are
my
lieutenants
rags
wet
rags
instead
of
men
cravens
baptized
apes
o
god
grant
me
ten
years
more
of
life
if
i
die
too
soon
the
cause
of
true
religion
is
lost
in
the
hands
of
such
boobies
you
are
as
great
a
fool
as
antoine
de
navarre
out
of
my
sight
leave
me
i
want
a
better
negotiator
than
you
you
are
an
ass
a
popinjay
a
poet
go
and
make
your
elegies
and
your
acrostics
you
trifler
hence
the
pains
of
his
body
were
absolutely
overcome
by
the
fire
of
his
anger
even
the
gout
subsided
under
this
horrible
excitement
of
his
mind
calvin
s
face
flushed
purple
like
the
sky
before
a
storm
his
vast
brow
shone
his
eyes
flamed
he
was
no
longer
himself
he
gave
way
utterly
to
the
species
of
epileptic
motion
full
of
passion
which
was
common
with
him
but
in
the
very
midst
of
it
he
was
struck
by
the
attitude
of
the
two
witnesses
then
as
he
caught
the
words
of
chaudieu
saying
to
de
beze
the
burning
bush
he
sat
down
was
silent
and
covered
his
face
with
his
two
hands
the
knotted
veins
of
which
were
throbbing
in
spite
of
their
coarse
texture
some
minutes
later
still
shaken
by
this
storm
raised
within
him
by
the
continence
of
his
life
he
said
in
a
voice
of
emotion
my
sins
which
are
many
cost
me
less
trouble
to
subdue
than
my
impatience
oh
savage
beast
shall
i
never
vanquish
you
he
cried
beating
his
breast
my
dear
master
said
de
beze
in
a
tender
voice
taking
calvin
s
hand
and
kissing
it
jupiter
thunders
but
he
knows
how
to
calvin
looked
at
his
disciple
with
a
softened
eye
and
said
understand
me
my
i
understand
that
the
pastors
of
peoples
bear
great
burdens
replied
theodore
you
have
a
world
upon
your
i
have
three
martyrs
said
chaudieu
whom
the
master
s
outburst
had
rendered
thoughtful
on
whom
we
can
rely
stuart
who
killed
minard
is
at
liberty
you
are
mistaken
said
calvin
gently
smiling
after
the
manner
of
great
men
who
bring
fair
weather
into
their
faces
as
though
they
were
ashamed
of
the
previous
storm
i
know
human
nature
a
man
may
kill
one
president
but
not
is
it
absolutely
necessary
asked
de
beze
again
exclaimed
calvin
his
nostrils
swelling
come
leave
me
you
will
drive
me
to
fury
take
my
decision
to
the
queen
you
chaudieu
go
your
way
and
hold
your
flock
together
in
paris
god
guide
you
dinah
light
my
friends
to
the
will
you
not
permit
me
to
embrace
you
said
theodore
much
moved
who
knows
what
may
happen
to
us
on
the
morrow
we
may
be
seized
in
spite
of
our
and
yet
you
want
to
spare
them
cried
calvin
embracing
de
beze
then
he
took
chaudieu
s
hand
and
said
above
all
no
huguenots
no
reformers
but
use
no
term
but
calvinism
alas
this
is
not
ambition
for
i
am
dying
but
it
is
necessary
to
destroy
the
whole
of
luther
even
to
the
name
of
lutheran
and
ah
man
divine
cried
chaudieu
you
well
deserve
such
maintain
the
uniformity
of
the
doctrine
let
no
one
henceforth
change
or
remark
it
we
are
lost
if
new
sects
issue
from
our
we
will
here
anticipate
the
events
on
which
this
study
is
based
and
close
the
history
of
theodore
de
beze
who
went
to
paris
with
chaudieu
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
poltrot
who
fired
at
the
duc
de
guise
fifteen
months
later
confessed
under
torture
that
he
had
been
urged
to
the
crime
by
theodore
de
beze
though
he
retracted
that
avowal
during
subsequent
tortures
so
that
bossuet
after
weighing
all
historical
considerations
felt
obliged
to
acquit
beze
of
instigating
the
crime
since
bossuet
s
time
however
an
apparently
futile
dissertation
apropos
of
a
celebrated
song
has
led
a
compiler
of
the
eighteenth
century
to
prove
that
the
verses
on
the
death
of
the
duc
de
guise
sung
by
the
huguenots
from
one
end
of
france
to
the
other
was
the
work
of
theodore
de
beze
and
it
is
also
proved
that
the
famous
song
on
the
burial
of
marlborough
was
a
plagiarism
on
it
one
of
the
most
remarkable
instances
of
the
transmission
of
songs
is
that
of
marlborough
written
in
the
first
instance
by
a
huguenot
on
the
death
of
the
duc
de
guise
in
it
was
preserved
in
the
french
army
and
appears
to
have
been
sung
with
variations
suppressions
and
additions
at
the
death
of
all
generals
of
importance
when
the
intestine
wars
were
over
the
song
followed
the
soldiers
into
civil
life
it
was
never
forgotten
though
the
habit
of
singing
it
may
have
lessened
and
in
sixty
years
after
the
death
of
marlborough
the
of
the
dauphin
was
heard
to
sing
it
as
she
suckled
her
nursling
when
and
why
the
name
of
the
duke
of
marlborough
was
substituted
for
that
of
the
duc
de
guise
has
never
been
ascertained

the
day
on
which
theodore
de

and
chaudieu
arrived
in
paris
the
court
returned
from
rheims
where
charles
ix
was
crowned
this
ceremony
which
catherine
made
magnificent
with
splendid
fetes
enabled
her
to
gather
about
her
the
leaders
of
the
various
parties
having
studied
all
interests
and
all
factions
she
found
herself
with
two
alternatives
from
which
to
choose
either
to
rally
them
all
to
the
throne
or
to
pit
them
one
against
the
other
the
connetable
de

supremely
catholic
whose
nephew
the
prince
de
conde
was
leader
of
the
reformers
and
whose
sons
were
inclined
to
the
new
religion
blamed
the
alliance
of
the
with
the
reformation
the
guises
on
their
side
were
endeavoring
to
gain
over
antoine
de
bourbon
king
of
navarre
a
weak
prince
a
manoeuvre
which
his
wife
jeanne
d
albret
instructed
by
de
beze
allowed
to
succeed
the
difficulties
were
plain
to
catherine
whose
dawning
power
needed
a
period
of
tranquillity
she
therefore
impatiently
awaited
calvin
s
reply
to
the
message
which
the
prince
de
conde
the
king
of
navarre
coligny
d
andelot
and
the
cardinal
de
chatillon
had
sent
him
through
de
beze
and
chaudieu
meantime
however
she
was
faithful
to
her
promises
as
to
the
prince
de
conde
the
chancellor
put
an
end
to
the
proceedings
in
which
christophe
was
involved
by
referring
the
affair
to
the
parliament
of
paris
which
at
once
set
aside
the
judgment
of
the
committee
declaring
it
without
power
to
try
a
prince
of
the
blood
the
parliament
then
reopened
the
trial
at
the
request
of
the
guises
and
the
lasagne
s
papers
had
already
been
given
to
catherine
who
burned
them
the
giving
up
of
these
papers
was
a
first
pledge
uselessly
made
by
the
guises
to
the
the
parliament
no
longer
able
to
take
cognizance
of
those
decisive
proofs
reinstated
the
prince
in
all
his
rights
property
and
honors
christophe
released
during
the
tumult
at
orleans
on
the
death
of
the
king
was
acquitted
in
the
first
instance
and
appointed
in
compensation
for
his
sufferings
solicitor
to
the
parliament
at
the
request
of
his
godfather
monsieur
de
thou
the
triumvirate
that
coming
coalition
of
threatened
by
catherine
s
first
acts
was
now
forming
itself
under
her
very
eyes
just
as
in
chemistry
antagonistic
substances
separate
at
the
first
shock
which
jars
their
enforced
union
so
in
politics
the
alliance
of
opposing
interests
never
lasts
catherine
thoroughly
understood
that
sooner
or
later
she
should
return
to
the
guises
and
combine
with
them
and
the
connetable
to
do
battle
against
the
huguenots
the
proposed
colloquy
which
tempted
the
vanity
of
the
orators
of
all
parties
and
offered
an
imposing
spectacle
to
succeed
that
of
the
coronation
and
enliven
the
bloody
ground
of
a
religious
war
which
in
point
of
fact
had
already
begun
was
as
futile
in
the
eyes
of
the
duc
de
guise
as
in
those
of
catherine
the
catholics
would
in
one
sense
be
worsted
for
the
huguenots
under
pretext
of
conferring
would
be
able
to
proclaim
their
doctrine
with
the
sanction
of
the
king
and
his
mother
to
the
ears
of
all
france
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
flattered
by
catherine
into
the
idea
of
destroying
the
heresy
by
the
eloquence
of
the
church
persuaded
his
brother
to
consent
and
thus
the
queen
obtained
what
was
to
her
six
months
of
peace
a
slight
event
occurring
at
this
time
came
near
compromising
the
power
which
catherine
had
so
painfully
built
up
the
following
scene
preserved
in
history
took
place
on
the
very
day
the
envoys
returned
from
geneva
in
the
hotel
de
coligny
near
the
louvre
at
his
coronation
charles
who
was
greatly
attached
to
his
tutor
amyot
appointed
him
of
france
this
affection
was
shared
by
his
brother
the
duc
d
anjou
afterwards
henri
another
of
anjou
s
pupils
catherine
heard
the
news
of
this
appointment
from
the
two
gondis
during
the
journey
from
rheims
to
paris
she
had
counted
on
that
office
in
the
gift
of
the
crown
to
gain
a
supporter
in
the
church
with
whom
to
oppose
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
her
choice
had
fallen
on
the
cardinal
de
tournon
in
whom
she
expected
to
find
as
in
l
hopital
another
the
word
is
her
own
as
soon
as
she
reached
the
louvre
she
sent
for
the
tutor
and
her
anger
was
such
on
seeing
the
disaster
to
her
policy
caused
by
the
ambition
of
this
son
of
a
shoemaker
that
she
was
betrayed
into
using
the
following
extraordinary
language
which
several
memoirs
of
the
day
have
handed
down
to
us
what
she
cried
am
i
who
compel
the
guises
the
colignys
the
connetables
the
house
of
navarre
the
prince
de
conde
to
serve
my
ends
am
i
to
be
opposed
by
a
priestling
like
you
who
are
not
satisfied
to
be
bishop
of
auxerre
amyot
excused
himself
he
assured
the
queen
that
he
had
asked
nothing
the
king
of
his
own
will
had
given
him
the
office
of
which
he
the
son
of
a
poor
tailor
felt
himself
quite
unworthy
be
assured
replied
catherine
that
being
the
name
which
the
two
kings
charles
ix
and
henri
gave
to
the
great
writer
that
you
will
not
stand
on
your
feet
hours
hence
unless
you
make
your
pupil
change
his
between
the
death
thus
threatened
and
the
resignation
of
the
highest
ecclesiastical
office
in
the
gift
of
the
crown
the
son
of
the
shoemaker
who
had
lately
become
extremely
eager
after
honors
and
may
even
have
coveted
a
cardinal
s
hat
thought
it
prudent
to
temporize
he
left
the
court
and
hid
himself
in
the
abbey
of
when
charles
ix
did
not
see
him
at
his
first
dinner
he
asked
where
he
was
some
guisard
doubtless
told
him
of
what
had
occurred
between
amyot
and
the
has
he
been
forced
to
disappear
because
i
made
him
cried
the
king
he
thereupon
rushed
to
his
mother
in
the
violent
wrath
of
angry
children
when
their
caprices
are
opposed
madame
he
said
on
entering
did
i
not
kindly
sign
the
letter
you
asked
me
to
send
to
parliament
by
means
of
which
you
govern
my
kingdom
did
you
not
promise
that
if
i
did
so
my
will
should
be
yours
and
here
the
first
favor
that
i
wish
to
bestow
excites
your
jealousy
the
chancellor
talks
of
declaring
my
majority
at
fourteen
three
years
from
now
and
you
wish
to
treat
me
as
a
child
by
god
i
will
be
king
and
a
king
as
my
father
and
grandfather
were
kings
the
tone
and
manner
in
which
these
words
were
said
gave
catherine
a
revelation
of
her
son
s
true
character
it
was
like
a
blow
in
the
breast
he
speaks
to
me
thus
he
whom
i
made
a
king
she
thought
monsieur
she
said
aloud
the
office
of
a
king
in
times
like
these
is
a
very
difficult
one
you
do
not
yet
know
the
shrewd
men
with
whom
you
have
to
deal
you
will
never
have
a
safer
and
more
sincere
friend
than
your
mother
or
better
servants
than
those
who
have
been
so
long
attached
to
her
person
without
whose
services
you
might
perhaps
not
even
exist
the
guises
want
both
your
life
and
your
throne
be
sure
of
that
if
they
could
sew
me
into
a
sack
and
fling
me
into
the
river
she
said
pointing
to
the
seine
it
would
be
done
they
know
that
i
am
a
lioness
defending
her
young
and
that
i
alone
prevent
their
daring
hands
from
seizing
your
crown
to
whom
to
whose
party
does
your
tutor
belong
who
are
his
allies
what
authority
has
he
what
services
can
he
do
you
what
weight
do
his
words
carry
instead
of
finding
a
prop
to
sustain
your
power
you
have
cut
the
ground
from
under
it
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
is
a
living
threat
to
you
he
plays
the
king
he
keeps
his
hat
on
his
head
before
the
princes
of
the
blood
it
was
urgently
necessary
to
invest
another
cardinal
with
powers
greater
than
his
own
but
what
have
you
done
is
amyot
that
shoemaker
fit
only
to
tie
the
ribbons
of
his
shoes
is
he
capable
of
making
head
against
the
guise
ambition
however
you
love
amyot
you
have
appointed
him
your
will
must
now
be
done
monsieur
but
before
you
make
such
gifts
again
i
pray
you
to
consult
me
in
affectionate
good
faith
listen
to
reasons
of
state
and
your
own
good
sense
as
a
child
may
perhaps
agree
with
my
old
experience
when
you
really
understand
the
difficulties
that
lie
before
then
i
can
have
my
master
back
again
cried
the
king
not
listening
to
his
mother
s
words
which
he
considered
to
be
mere
reproaches
yes
you
shall
have
him
she
replied
but
it
is
not
here
nor
that
brutal
cypierre
who
will
teach
you
how
to
it
is
for
you
to
do
so
my
dear
mother
said
the
boy
mollified
by
his
victory
and
relaxing
the
surly
and
threatening
look
stamped
by
nature
upon
his
countenance
catherine
sent
gondi
to
recall
the
new
when
the
italian
discovered
the
place
of
amyot
s
retreat
and
the
bishop
heard
that
the
courtier
was
sent
by
the
queen
he
was
seized
with
terror
and
refused
to
leave
the
abbey
in
this
extremity
catherine
was
obliged
to
write
to
him
herself
in
such
terms
that
he
returned
to
paris
and
received
from
her
own
lips
the
assurance
of
her
protection
on
condition
however
that
he
would
blindly
promote
her
wishes
with
charles
ix
this
little
domestic
tempest
over
the
queen
now
in
the
louvre
after
an
absence
of
more
than
a
year
held
council
with
her
closest
friends
as
to
the
proper
conduct
to
pursue
with
the
young
king
whom
cypierre
had
complimented
on
his
firmness
what
is
best
to
be
done
she
said
to
the
two
gondis
ruggiero
birago
and
chiverni
who
had
lately
become
governor
and
chancellor
to
the
duc
d
anjou
before
all
else
replied
birago
get
rid
of
cypierre
he
is
not
a
courtier
he
will
never
accommodate
himself
to
your
ideas
and
will
think
he
does
his
duty
in
thwarting
whom
can
i
trust
cried
the
queen
one
of
us
said
birago
on
my
honor
exclaimed
gondi
i
ll
promise
you
to
make
the
king
as
docile
as
the
king
of
you
allowed
the
late
king
to
perish
to
save
your
other
children
said
albert
de
gondi
do
then
as
the
great
signors
of
constantinople
do
divert
the
anger
and
amuse
the
caprices
of
the
present
king
he
loves
art
and
poetry
and
hunting
also
a
little
girl
he
saw
at
orleans
occupation
enough
for
will
you
really
be
the
king
s
governor
said
catherine
to
the
ablest
of
the
gondis
yes
if
you
will
give
me
the
necessary
authority
you
may
even
be
obliged
to
make
me
marshal
of
france
and
a
duke
cypierre
is
altogether
too
small
a
man
to
hold
the
office
in
future
the
governor
of
a
king
of
france
should
be
of
some
great
dignity
like
that
of
duke
and
he
is
right
said
birago
poet
and
huntsman
said
catherine
in
a
dreamy
tone
we
will
hunt
and
make
love
cried
gondi
moreover
remarked
chiverni
you
are
sure
of
amyot
who
will
always
fear
poison
in
case
of
disobedience
so
that
you
and
he
and
gondi
can
hold
the
king
in
amyot
has
deeply
offended
me
said
catherine
he
does
not
know
what
he
owes
to
you
if
he
did
know
you
would
be
in
danger
replied
birago
gravely
emphasizing
his
words
then
it
is
agreed
exclaimed
catherine
on
whom
birago
s
reply
made
a
powerful
impression
that
you
gondi
are
to
be
the
king
s
governor
my
son
must
consent
to
do
for
one
of
my
friends
a
favor
equal
to
the
one
i
have
just
permitted
for
his
knave
of
a
bishop
that
fool
has
lost
the
hat
for
never
as
long
as
i
live
will
i
consent
that
the
pope
shall
give
it
to
him
how
strong
we
might
have
been
with
cardinal
de
tournon
what
a
trio
with
tournon
for
and
l
hopital
and
de
thou
as
for
the
burghers
of
paris
i
intend
to
make
my
son
cajole
them
we
will
get
a
support
accordingly
albert
de
gondi
became
a
marshal
of
france
and
was
created
duc
de
retz
and
governor
of
the
king
a
few
days
later
at
the
moment
when
this
little
private
council
ended
cardinal
de
tournon
announced
to
the
queen
the
arrival
of
the
emissaries
sent
to
calvin
admiral
coligny
accompanied
the
party
in
order
that
his
presence
might
ensure
them
due
respect
at
the
louvre
the
queen
gathered
the
formidable
phalanx
of
her
maids
of
honor
about
her
and
passed
into
the
reception
hall
built
by
her
husband
which
no
longer
exists
in
the
louvre
of
at
the
period
of
which
we
write
the
staircase
of
the
louvre
occupied
the
clock
tower
catherine
s
apartments
were
in
the
old
buildings
which
still
exist
in
the
court
of
the
musee
the
present
staircase
of
the
museum
was
built
in
what
was
formerly
the
des
the
ballet
of
those
days
was
a
sort
of
dramatic
entertainment
performed
by
the
whole
court
revolutionary
passions
gave
rise
to
a
most
laughable
error
about
charles
in
connection
with
the
louvre
during
the
revolution
hostile
opinions
as
to
this
king
whose
real
character
was
masked
made
a
monster
of
him
joseph
cheniers
tragedy
was
written
under
the
influence
of
certain
words
scratched
on
the
window
of
the
projecting
wing
of
the
louvre
looking
toward
the
quay
the
words
were
as
follows
it
was
from
this
window
that
charles
of
execrable
memory
fired
upon
french
it
is
well
to
inform
future
historians
and
all
sensible
persons
that
this
portion
of
the
louvre
called
the
old
louvre
which
projects
upon
the
quay
and
is
connected
with
the
louvre
by
the
room
called
the
apollo
gallery
while
the
great
halls
of
the
museum
connect
the
louvre
with
the
tuileries
did
not
exist
in
the
time
of
charles
ix
the
greater
part
of
the
space
where
the
frontage
on
the
quay
now
stands
and
where
the
garden
of
the
infanta
is
laid
out
was
then
occupied
by
the
hotel
de
bourbon
which
belonged
to
and
was
the
residence
of
the
house
of
navarre
it
was
absolutely
impossible
therefore
for
charles
ix
to
fire
from
the
louvre
of
henri
ii
upon
a
boat
full
of
huguenots
crossing
the
river
although
the
present
the
seine
can
be
seen
from
its
windows
even
if
learned
men
and
libraries
did
not
possess
maps
of
the
louvre
made
in
the
time
of
charles
on
which
its
then
position
is
clearly
indicated
the
building
itself
refutes
the
error
all
the
kings
who
in
the
work
of
erecting
this
enormous
mass
of
buildings
never
failed
to
put
their
initials
or
some
special
monogram
on
the
parts
they
had
severally
built
now
the
part
we
speak
of
the
venerable
and
now
blackened
wing
of
the
louvre
projecting
on
the
quay
and
overlooking
the
garden
of
the
infanta
bears
the
monograms
of
henri
iii
and
henri
which
are
totally
different
from
that
of
henri
who
invariably
joined
his
h
to
the
two
c
s
of
catherine
forming
a
d
which
by
the
bye
has
constantly
deceived
superficial
persons
into
fancying
that
the
king
put
the
initial
of
his
mistress
diane
on
great
public
buildings
henri
iv
united
the
louvre
with
his
own
hotel
de
bourbon
its
garden
and
dependencies
he
was
the
first
to
think
of
connecting
catherine
de
medici
s
palace
of
the
tuileries
with
the
louvre
by
his
unfinished
galleries
the
precious
sculptures
of
which
have
been
so
cruelly
neglected
even
if
the
map
of
paris
and
the
monograms
of
henri
iii
and
henri
iv
did
not
exist
the
difference
of
architecture
is
refutation
enough
to
the
calumny
the
vermiculated
stone
copings
of
the
hotel
de
la
force
mark
the
transition
between
what
is
called
the
architecture
of
the
renaissance
and
that
of
henri
henri
and
louis
xiii
this
archaeological
digression
continuing
the
sketches
of
old
paris
with
which
we
began
this
history
enables
us
to
picture
to
our
minds
the
then
appearance
of
this
other
corner
of
the
old
city
of
which
nothing
now
remains
but
henri
s
addition
to
the
louvre
with
its
admirable
now
being
rapidly
annihilated
when
the
court
heard
that
the
queen
was
about
to
give
an
audience
to
theodore
de
beze
and
chaudieu
presented
by
admiral
coligny
all
the
courtiers
who
had
the
right
of
entrance
to
the
reception
hall
hastened
thither
to
witness
the
interview
it
was
about
six
o
clock
in
the
evening
coligny
had
just
supped
and
was
using
a
toothpick
as
he
came
up
the
staircase
of
the
louvre
between
the
two
reformers
the
practice
of
using
a
toothpick
was
so
inveterate
a
habit
with
the
admiral
that
he
was
seen
to
do
it
on
the
while
planning
a
retreat
distrust
the
admiral
s
toothpick
the
of
the
connetable
and
catherine
s
was
a
court
proverb
of
that
day
after
the
the
populace
made
a
horrible
jest
on
the
body
of
coligny
which
hung
for
three
days
at
montfaucon
by
putting
a
grotesque
toothpick
into
his
mouth
history
has
recorded
this
atrocious
levity
so
petty
an
act
done
in
the
midst
of
that
great
catastrophe
pictures
the
parisian
populace
which
deserves
the
sarcastic
jibe
of
boileau
frenchmen
born
created
the
the
parisian
of
all
time
cracks
jokes
and
makes
lampoons
before
during
and
after
the
most
horrible
revolutions
theodore
de
beze
wore
the
dress
of
a
courtier
black
silk
stockings
low
shoes
with
straps
across
the
instep
tight
breeches
a
black
silk
doublet
with
slashed
sleeves
and
a
small
black
velvet
mantle
over
which
lay
an
elegant
white
fluted
ruff
his
beard
was
trimmed
to
a
moustache
and
now
called
imperial
and
he
carried
a
sword
at
his
side
and
a
cane
in
his
hand
whosoever
knows
the
galleries
of
versailles
or
the
collections
of
odieuvre
knows
also
his
round
almost
jovial
face
and
lively
eyes
surmounted
by
the
broad
forehead
which
characterized
the
writers
and
poets
of
that
day
de
beze
had
what
served
him
admirably
an
agreeable
air
and
manner
in
this
he
was
a
great
contrast
to
coligny
of
austere
countenance
and
to
the
sour
bilious
chaudieu
who
chose
to
wear
on
this
occasion
the
robe
and
bands
of
a
calvinist
minister
the
scenes
that
happen
in
our
day
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
and
which
no
doubt
happened
in
the
convention
will
give
an
idea
of
how
at
this
court
at
this
epoch
these
men
who
six
months
later
were
to
fight
to
the
death
in
a
war
without
quarter
could
meet
and
talk
to
each
other
with
courtesy
and
even
laughter
birago
who
was
coldly
to
advise
the
and
cardinal
de
lorraine
who
charged
his
servant
besme
not
to
miss
the
admiral
now
advanced
to
meet
coligny
birago
saying
with
a
smile
well
my
dear
admiral
so
you
have
really
taken
upon
yourself
to
present
these
gentlemen
from
geneva
perhaps
you
will
call
it
a
crime
in
replied
the
admiral
jesting
whereas
if
you
had
done
it
yourself
you
would
make
a
merit
of
they
say
that
the
sieur
calvin
is
very
ill
remarked
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
to
theodore
de
beze
i
hope
no
one
suspects
us
of
giving
him
his
ah
monseigneur
it
would
be
too
great
a
risk
replied
de
beze
maliciously
the
duc
de
guise
who
was
watching
chaudieu
looked
fixedly
at
his
brother
and
at
birago
who
were
both
taken
aback
by
de
beze
s
answer
good
god
remarked
the
cardinal
heretics
are
not
diplomatic
to
avoid
embarrassment
the
queen
who
was
announced
at
this
moment
had
arranged
to
remain
standing
during
the
audience
she
began
by
speaking
to
the
connetable
who
had
previously
remonstrated
with
her
vehemently
on
the
scandal
of
receiving
messengers
from
calvin
you
see
my
dear
connetable
she
said
that
i
receive
them
without
madame
said
the
admiral
approaching
the
queen
these
are
two
teachers
of
the
new
religion
who
have
come
to
an
understanding
with
calvin
and
who
have
his
instructions
as
to
a
conference
in
which
the
churches
of
france
may
be
able
to
settle
their
this
is
monsieur
de
beze
to
whom
my
wife
is
much
attached
said
the
king
of
navarre
coming
forward
and
taking
de
beze
by
the
hand
and
this
is
chaudieu
said
the
prince
de
conde
the
duc
de
guise
knows
the
soldier
he
added
looking
at
le
balafre
perhaps
he
will
now
like
to
know
the
this
gasconade
made
the
whole
court
laugh
even
catherine
faith
replied
the
duc
de
guise
i
am
enchanted
to
see
a
who
knows
so
well
how
to
choose
his
men
and
to
employ
them
in
their
right
sphere
one
of
your
agents
he
said
to
chaudieu
actually
endured
the
extraordinary
question
without
dying
and
without
confessing
a
single
thing
i
call
myself
brave
but
i
don
t
know
that
i
could
have
endured
it
as
he
hum
muttered
ambroise
you
did
not
say
a
word
when
i
pulled
the
javelin
out
of
your
face
at
catherine
standing
at
the
centre
of
a
semicircle
of
the
courtiers
and
maids
of
honor
kept
silence
she
was
observing
the
two
reformers
trying
to
penetrate
their
minds
as
with
the
shrewd
intelligent
glance
of
her
black
eyes
she
studied
them
one
seems
to
be
the
scabbard
the
other
the
blade
whispered
albert
de
gondi
in
her
ear
well
gentlemen
said
catherine
at
last
unable
to
restrain
a
smile
has
your
master
given
you
permission
to
unite
in
a
public
conference
at
which
you
will
be
converted
by
the
arguments
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
who
are
the
glory
of
our
state
we
have
no
master
but
the
lord
said
chaudieu
but
surely
you
will
allow
some
little
authority
to
the
king
of
france
said
catherine
smiling
and
much
to
the
queen
said
de
beze
bowing
low
you
will
find
continued
the
queen
that
our
most
submissive
subjects
are
ah
madame
cried
coligny
we
will
indeed
endeavor
to
make
you
a
noble
and
peaceful
kingdom
europe
has
profited
alas
by
our
internal
divisions
for
the
last
fifty
years
she
has
had
the
advantage
of
of
the
french
people
being
against
the
other
are
we
here
to
sing
anthems
to
the
glory
of
heretics
said
the
connetable
brutally
no
but
to
bring
them
to
repentance
whispered
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
in
his
ear
we
want
to
coax
them
by
a
little
do
you
know
what
i
should
have
done
under
the
late
king
said
the
connetable
angrily
i
d
have
called
in
the
provost
and
hung
those
two
knaves
then
and
there
on
the
gallows
of
the
well
gentlemen
who
are
the
learned
men
whom
you
have
selected
as
our
opponents
inquired
the
queen
imposing
silence
on
the
connetable
by
a
look
and
theodore
de
beze
will
speak
on
our
side
replied
chaudieu
the
court
will
doubtless
go
to
and
as
it
would
be
improper
that
this
should
take
place
in
a
royal
residence
we
will
have
it
in
the
little
town
of
poissy
said
catherine
shall
we
be
safe
there
madame
asked
chaudieu
ah
replied
the
queen
with
a
sort
of
naivete
you
will
surely
know
how
to
take
precautions
the
admiral
will
arrange
all
that
with
my
cousins
the
guises
and
de
the
devil
take
them
cried
the
connetable
i
ll
have
nothing
to
do
with
how
do
you
contrive
to
give
such
strength
of
character
to
your
converts
said
the
queen
leading
chaudieu
apart
the
son
of
my
furrier
was
actually
we
have
faith
replied
chaudieu
at
this
moment
the
hall
presented
a
scene
of
animated
groups
all
discussing
the
question
of
the
proposed
assembly
to
which
the
few
words
said
by
the
queen
had
already
given
the
name
of
the
colloquy
of
catherine
glanced
at
chaudieu
and
was
able
to
say
to
him
unheard
yes
a
new
faith
ah
madame
if
you
were
not
blinded
by
your
alliance
with
the
court
of
rome
you
would
see
that
we
are
returning
to
the
true
doctrines
of
jesus
christ
who
recognizing
the
equality
of
souls
bestows
upon
all
men
equal
rights
on
do
you
think
yourself
the
equal
of
calvin
asked
the
queen
shrewdly
no
no
we
are
equals
only
in
church
what
would
you
unbind
the
tie
of
the
people
to
the
throne
she
cried
then
you
are
not
only
heretics
you
are
revolutionists
rebels
against
obedience
to
the
king
as
you
are
against
that
to
the
pope
so
saying
she
left
chaudieu
abruptly
and
returned
to
theodore
de
beze
i
count
on
you
monsieur
she
said
to
conduct
this
colloquy
in
good
faith
take
all
the
time
you
i
had
supposed
said
chaudieu
to
the
prince
de
conde
the
king
of
navarre
and
admiral
coligny
as
they
left
the
hall
that
a
great
state
matter
would
be
treated
more
oh
we
know
very
well
what
you
want
exclaimed
the
prince
de
conde
exchanging
a
sly
look
with
theodore
de
beze
the
prince
now
left
his
adherents
to
attend
a
rendezvous
this
great
leader
of
a
party
was
also
one
of
the
most
favored
gallants
of
the
court
the
two
choice
beauties
of
that
day
were
even
then
striving
with
such
desperate
eagerness
for
his
affections
that
one
of
them
the
marechale
de
the
wife
of
the
future
triumvir
gave
him
her
beautiful
estate
of
hoping
to
win
him
away
from
the
duchesse
de
guise
the
wife
of
the
man
who
had
tried
to
take
his
head
on
the
scaffold
the
duchess
not
being
able
to
detach
the
duc
de
nemours
from
mademoiselle
de
rohan
fell
in
love
with
the
leader
of
the
reformers
what
a
contrast
to
geneva
said
chaudieu
to
theodore
de
beze
as
they
crossed
the
little
bridge
of
the
louvre
the
people
here
are
certainly
gayer
than
the
genevese
i
don
t
see
why
they
should
be
so
treacherous
replied
de
beze
to
treachery
oppose
treachery
replied
chaudieu
whispering
the
words
in
his
companion
s
ear
i
have
in
paris
on
whom
i
can
rely
and
i
intend
to
make
calvin
a
prophet
christophe
lecamus
shall
deliver
us
from
our
most
dangerous
the
for
whom
the
poor
devil
endured
his
torture
has
already
with
a
high
hand
caused
him
to
be
appointed
solicitor
to
the
parliament
and
solicitors
make
better
prosecutors
than
murderers
don
t
you
remember
how
avenelles
betrayed
the
secrets
of
our
first
uprising
i
know
christophe
said
chaudieu
in
a
positive
tone
as
he
turned
to
leave
the
envoy
from
geneva
xv
compensation
a
few
days
after
the
reception
of
calvin
s
emissaries
by
the
queen
that
is
to
say
toward
the
close
of
the
year
for
the
year
then
began
at
easter
and
the
present
calendar
was
not
adopted
until
later
in
the
reign
of
charles
ix
christophe
reclined
in
an
easy
chair
beside
the
fire
in
the
large
brown
hall
dedicated
to
family
life
that
overlooked
the
river
in
his
father
s
house
where
the
present
drama
was
begun
his
feet
rested
on
a
stool
his
mother
and
babette
lallier
had
just
renewed
the
compresses
saturated
with
a
solution
brought
by
ambroise
pare
who
was
charged
by
catherine
de
medici
to
take
care
of
the
young
man
once
restored
to
his
family
christophe
became
the
object
of
the
most
devoted
care
babette
authorized
by
her
father
came
very
morning
and
only
left
the
lecamus
household
at
night
christophe
the
admiration
of
the
apprentices
gave
rise
throughout
the
quarter
to
various
tales
which
invested
him
with
mysterious
poesy
he
had
borne
the
worst
torture
the
celebrated
ambroise
pare
was
employing
all
his
skill
to
cure
him
what
great
deed
had
he
done
to
be
thus
treated
neither
christophe
nor
his
father
said
a
word
on
the
subject
catherine
then
was
concerned
in
their
silence
as
well
as
the
prince
de
conde
the
constant
visits
of
pare
now
chief
surgeon
of
both
the
king
and
the
house
of
guise
whom
the
and
the
lorrains
allowed
to
treat
a
youth
accused
of
heresy
strangely
complicated
an
affair
through
which
no
one
saw
clearly
moreover
the
rector
of
came
several
times
to
visit
the
son
of
his
and
these
visits
made
the
causes
of
christophe
s
present
condition
still
more
unintelligible
to
his
neighbors
the
old
syndic
who
had
his
plan
gave
evasive
answers
to
his
the
merchants
of
the
neighborhood
and
to
all
friends
who
spoke
to
him
of
his
son
yes
i
am
very
thankful
to
have
saved
well
you
know
it
won
t
do
to
put
your
finger
between
the
bark
and
the
my
son
touched
fire
and
came
near
burning
up
my
they
took
advantage
of
his
youth
we
burghers
get
nothing
but
shame
and
evil
by
frequenting
the
this
affair
decides
me
to
make
a
lawyer
of
christophe
the
practice
of
law
will
teach
him
to
weigh
his
words
and
his
the
young
queen
who
is
now
in
scotland
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it
but
then
to
be
sure
my
son
may
have
been
i
have
had
cruel
all
this
may
decide
me
to
give
up
my
business
i
do
not
wish
ever
to
go
to
court
my
son
has
had
enough
of
the
reformation
it
has
cracked
all
his
joints
if
it
had
not
been
for
ambroise
i
don
t
know
what
would
have
become
of
thanks
to
these
ambiguous
remarks
and
to
the
great
discretion
of
such
conduct
it
was
generally
averred
in
the
neighborhood
that
christophe
had
seen
the
error
of
his
ways
everybody
thought
it
natural
that
the
old
syndic
should
wish
to
get
his
son
appointed
to
the
parliament
and
the
rector
s
visits
no
longer
seemed
extraordinary
as
the
neighbors
reflected
on
the
old
man
s
anxieties
they
no
longer
thought
as
they
would
otherwise
have
done
that
his
ambition
was
inordinate
the
young
lawyer
who
had
lain
helpless
for
months
on
the
bed
which
his
family
made
up
for
him
in
the
old
hall
was
now
for
the
last
week
able
to
rise
and
move
about
by
the
aid
of
crutches
babette
s
love
and
his
mother
s
tenderness
had
deeply
touched
his
heart
and
they
while
they
had
him
helpless
in
their
hands
lectured
him
severely
on
religion
president
de
thou
paid
his
godson
a
visit
during
which
he
showed
himself
most
fatherly
christophe
being
now
a
solicitor
of
the
parliament
must
of
course
he
said
be
catholic
his
oath
would
bind
him
to
that
and
the
president
who
assumed
not
to
doubt
of
his
godson
s
orthodoxy
ended
his
remarks
by
saying
with
great
earnestness
my
son
you
have
been
cruelly
tried
i
am
myself
ignorant
of
the
reasons
which
made
the
messieurs
de
guise
treat
you
thus
but
i
advise
you
in
future
to
live
peacefully
without
entering
into
the
troubles
of
the
times
for
the
favor
of
the
king
and
queen
will
not
be
shown
to
the
makers
of
revolt
you
are
not
important
enough
to
play
fast
and
loose
with
the
king
as
the
guises
do
if
you
wish
to
be
some
day
counsellor
to
the
parliament
remember
that
you
can
not
obtain
that
noble
office
unless
by
a
real
and
serious
attachment
to
the
royal
nevertheless
neither
president
de
thou
s
visit
nor
the
seductions
of
babette
nor
the
urgency
of
his
mother
were
sufficient
to
shake
the
constancy
of
the
martyr
of
the
reformation
christophe
held
to
his
religion
all
the
more
because
he
had
suffered
for
it
my
father
will
never
let
me
marry
a
heretic
whispered
babette
in
his
ear
christophe
answered
only
by
tears
which
made
the
young
girl
silent
and
thoughtful
old
lecamus
maintained
his
paternal
and
magisterial
dignity
he
observed
his
son
and
said
little
the
stern
old
man
after
recovering
his
dear
christophe
was
dissatisfied
with
himself
he
repented
the
tenderness
he
had
shown
for
this
only
son
but
he
admired
him
secretly
at
no
period
of
his
life
did
the
syndic
pull
more
wires
to
reach
his
ends
for
he
saw
the
field
ripe
for
the
harvest
so
painfully
sown
and
he
wanted
to
gather
the
whole
of
it
some
days
before
the
morning
of
which
we
write
he
had
had
being
alone
with
christophe
a
long
conversation
with
him
in
which
he
endeavored
to
discover
the
secret
reason
of
the
young
man
s
resistance
christophe
who
was
not
without
ambition
betrayed
his
faith
in
the
prince
de
conde
the
generous
promise
of
the
prince
who
of
course
was
only
exercising
his
profession
of
prince
remained
graven
on
his
heart
little
did
he
think
that
conde
had
sent
him
mentally
to
the
devil
in
orleans
muttering
a
gascon
would
have
understood
me
better
when
christophe
called
out
a
touching
farewell
as
the
prince
passed
the
window
of
his
dungeon
but
besides
this
sentiment
of
admiration
for
the
prince
christophe
had
also
conceived
a
profound
reverence
for
the
great
queen
who
had
explained
to
him
by
a
single
look
the
necessity
which
compelled
her
to
sacrifice
him
and
who
during
his
agony
had
given
him
an
illimitable
promise
in
a
single
tear
during
the
silent
months
of
his
weakness
as
he
lay
there
waiting
for
recovery
he
thought
over
each
event
at
blois
and
at
orleans
he
weighed
one
might
almost
say
in
spite
of
himself
the
relative
worth
of
these
two
protections
he
floated
between
the
queen
and
the
prince
he
had
certainly
served
catherine
more
than
he
had
served
the
reformation
and
in
a
young
man
both
heart
and
mind
would
naturally
incline
toward
the
queen
less
because
she
was
a
queen
than
because
she
was
a
woman
under
such
circumstances
a
man
will
always
hope
more
from
a
woman
than
from
a
man
i
sacrificed
myself
for
her
what
will
she
do
for
me
this
question
christophe
put
to
himself
almost
involuntarily
as
he
remembered
the
tone
in
which
she
had
said
the
words
it
is
difficult
to
believe
how
egotistical
a
man
can
become
when
he
lies
on
a
bed
of
sickness
everything
even
the
exclusive
devotion
of
which
he
is
the
object
drives
him
to
think
only
of
himself
by
exaggerating
in
his
own
mind
the
obligation
which
the
prince
de
conde
was
under
to
him
he
had
come
to
expect
that
some
office
would
be
given
to
him
at
the
court
of
navarre
still
new
to
the
world
of
political
life
he
forgot
its
contending
interests
and
the
rapid
march
of
events
which
control
and
force
the
hand
of
all
leaders
of
parties
he
forgot
it
the
more
because
he
was
practically
a
prisoner
in
solitary
confinement
on
his
bed
in
that
old
brown
room
each
party
is
necessarily
ungrateful
while
the
struggle
lasts
when
it
triumphs
it
has
too
many
persons
to
reward
not
to
be
ungrateful
still
soldiers
submit
to
this
ingratitude
but
their
leaders
turn
against
the
new
master
at
whose
side
they
have
acted
and
suffered
like
equals
for
so
long
christophe
who
alone
remembered
his
sufferings
felt
himself
already
among
the
leaders
of
the
reformation
by
the
fact
of
his
martyrdom
his
father
that
old
fox
of
commerce
so
shrewd
so
perspicacious
ended
by
divining
the
secret
thought
of
his
son
consequently
all
his
manoeuvres
were
now
based
on
the
natural
expectancy
to
which
christophe
had
yielded
himself
wouldn
t
it
be
a
fine
thing
he
had
said
to
babette
in
presence
of
the
family
a
few
days
before
his
interview
with
his
son
to
be
the
wife
of
a
counsellor
of
the
parliament
you
would
be
called
you
are
crazy
said
lallier
where
would
you
get
ten
thousand
crowns
income
from
landed
property
which
a
counsellor
must
have
according
to
law
and
from
whom
could
you
buy
the
office
no
one
but
the
and
regent
could
help
your
son
into
parliament
and
i
m
afraid
he
s
too
tainted
with
the
new
opinions
for
what
would
you
pay
to
see
your
daughter
the
wife
of
a
counsellor
ah
you
want
to
look
into
my
purse
said
lallier
counsellor
to
the
parliament
the
words
worked
powerfully
in
christophe
s
brain
sometime
after
this
conversation
one
morning
when
christophe
was
gazing
at
the
river
and
thinking
of
the
scene
which
began
this
history
of
the
prince
de
conde
chaudieu
la
renaudie
of
his
journey
to
blois
in
short
the
whole
story
of
his
hopes
his
father
came
and
sat
down
beside
him
scarcely
concealing
a
joyful
thought
beneath
a
serious
manner
my
son
he
said
after
what
passed
between
you
and
the
leaders
of
the
tumult
of
amboise
they
owe
you
enough
to
make
the
care
of
your
future
incumbent
on
the
house
of
yes
replied
christophe
well
continued
his
father
i
have
asked
their
permission
to
buy
a
legal
practice
for
you
in
the
province
of
bearn
our
good
friend
pare
undertook
to
present
the
letters
which
i
wrote
on
your
behalf
to
the
prince
de
conde
and
the
queen
of
navarre
here
read
the
answer
of
monsieur
de
pibrac
of
navarre
to
the
sieur
lecamus
of
the
guild
of
monseigneur
le
prince
de
conde
desires
me
to
express
his
regret
that
he
can
not
do
what
you
ask
for
his
late
companion
in
the
tower
of
whom
he
perfectly
remembers
and
to
whom
meanwhile
he
offers
the
place
of
gendarme
in
his
company
which
will
put
your
son
in
the
way
of
making
his
mark
as
a
man
of
courage
which
he
is
the
queen
of
navarre
awaits
an
opportunity
to
reward
the
sieur
christophe
and
will
not
fail
to
take
advantage
of
it
upon
which
monsieur
le
syndic
we
pray
god
to
have
you
in
his
keeping
pibrac
at
nerac
chancellor
of
nerac
pibrac
crack
cried
babette
there
s
no
confidence
to
be
placed
in
gascons
they
think
only
of
old
lecamus
looked
at
his
son
smiling
scornfully
they
propose
to
put
on
horseback
a
poor
boy
whose
knees
and
ankles
were
shattered
for
their
sakes
cried
the
mother
what
a
wicked
jest
i
shall
never
see
you
a
counsellor
of
navarre
said
his
father
i
wish
i
knew
what
queen
catherine
would
do
for
me
if
i
made
a
claim
upon
her
said
christophe
cast
down
by
the
prince
s
answer
she
made
you
no
promise
said
the
old
man
but
i
am
certain
that
will
never
mock
you
like
these
others
she
will
remember
your
sufferings
still
how
can
the
queen
make
a
counsellor
of
the
parliament
out
of
a
protestant
burgher
but
christophe
has
not
abjured
cried
babette
he
can
very
well
keep
his
private
opinions
the
prince
de
conde
would
be
less
disdainful
of
a
counsellor
of
the
parliament
said
lallier
well
what
say
you
christophe
urged
babette
you
are
counting
without
the
queen
replied
the
young
lawyer
a
few
days
after
this
rather
bitter
disillusion
an
apprentice
brought
christophe
the
following
laconic
little
missive
chaudieu
wishes
to
see
his
son
let
him
come
in
cried
christophe
oh
my
sacred
martyr
said
the
minister
embracing
him
have
you
recovered
from
your
sufferings
yes
thanks
to
thanks
rather
to
god
who
gave
you
the
strength
to
endure
the
torture
but
what
is
this
i
hear
have
you
allowed
them
to
make
you
a
solicitor
have
you
taken
the
oath
of
fidelity
surely
you
will
not
recognize
that
prostitute
the
roman
catholic
and
apostolic
church
my
father
wished
but
ought
we
not
to
leave
fathers
and
mothers
and
wives
and
children
all
all
for
the
sacred
cause
of
calvinism
nay
must
we
not
suffer
all
things
ah
christophe
calvin
the
great
calvin
the
whole
party
the
whole
world
the
future
counts
upon
your
courage
and
the
grandeur
of
your
soul
we
want
your
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
in
the
mind
of
man
that
the
most
devoted
spirits
even
while
devoting
themselves
build
romantic
hopes
upon
their
perilous
enterprises
when
the
prince
the
soldier
and
the
minister
had
asked
christophe
under
the
bridge
to
convey
to
catherine
the
treaty
which
if
discovered
would
in
all
probability
cost
him
his
life
the
lad
had
relied
on
his
nerve
upon
chance
upon
the
powers
of
his
mind
and
confident
in
such
hopes
he
bravely
nay
audaciously
put
himself
between
those
terrible
adversaries
the
guises
and
catherine
during
the
torture
he
still
kept
saying
to
himself
i
shall
come
out
of
it
it
is
only
pain
but
when
this
second
and
brutal
demand
die
we
want
your
life
was
made
upon
a
boy
who
was
still
almost
helpless
scarcely
recovered
from
his
late
torture
and
clinging
all
the
more
to
life
because
he
had
just
seen
death
so
near
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
launch
into
further
illusions
christophe
answered
quietly
what
is
it
now
to
fire
a
pistol
courageously
as
stuart
did
on
on
whom
the
duc
de
a
murder
a
vengeance
have
you
forgotten
the
hundred
gentlemen
massacred
on
the
scaffold
at
amboise
a
child
who
saw
that
butchery
the
little
d
aubigne
cried
out
they
have
slaughtered
france
you
should
receive
the
blows
of
others
and
give
none
that
is
the
religion
of
the
gospel
said
christophe
if
you
imitate
the
catholics
in
their
cruelty
of
what
good
is
it
to
reform
the
church
oh
christophe
they
have
made
you
a
lawyer
and
now
you
argue
said
chaudieu
no
my
friend
replied
the
young
man
but
parties
are
ungrateful
and
you
will
be
both
you
and
yours
nothing
more
than
puppets
of
the
christophe
if
you
could
hear
calvin
you
would
know
how
we
wear
them
like
gloves
the
bourbons
are
the
gloves
we
are
the
read
that
said
christophe
giving
chaudieu
pibrac
s
letter
containing
the
answer
of
the
prince
de
conde
oh
my
son
you
are
ambitious
you
can
no
longer
make
the
sacrifice
of
yourself
i
pity
you
with
those
fine
words
chaudieu
turned
and
left
him
some
days
after
that
scene
the
lallier
family
and
the
lecamus
family
were
gathered
together
in
honor
of
the
formal
betrothal
of
christophe
and
babette
in
the
old
brown
hall
from
which
christophe
s
bed
had
been
removed
for
he
was
now
able
to
drag
himself
about
and
even
mount
the
stairs
without
his
crutches
it
was
nine
o
clock
in
the
evening
and
the
company
were
awaiting
ambroise
pare
the
family
notary
sat
before
a
table
on
which
lay
various
contracts
the
furrier
was
selling
his
house
and
business
to
his
who
was
to
pay
down
forty
thousand
francs
for
the
house
and
then
mortgage
it
as
security
for
the
payment
of
the
goods
for
which
however
he
paid
twenty
thousand
francs
on
account
lecamus
was
also
buying
for
his
son
a
magnificent
stone
house
built
by
philibert
de
l
orme
in
the
rue
which
he
gave
to
christophe
as
a
marriage
portion
he
also
took
two
hundred
thousand
francs
from
his
own
fortune
and
lallier
gave
as
much
more
for
the
purchase
of
a
fine
seignorial
manor
in
picardy
the
price
of
which
was
five
hundred
thousand
francs
as
this
manor
was
a
tenure
from
the
crown
it
was
necessary
to
obtain
called
granted
by
the
king
and
also
to
make
payment
to
the
crown
of
considerable
feudal
dues
the
marriage
had
been
postponed
until
this
royal
favor
was
obtained
though
the
burghers
of
paris
had
lately
acquired
the
right
to
purchase
manors
the
wisdom
of
the
privy
council
had
been
exercised
in
putting
certain
restrictions
on
the
sale
of
those
estates
which
were
dependencies
of
the
crown
and
the
one
which
old
lecamus
had
had
in
his
eye
for
the
last
dozen
years
was
among
them
ambroise
was
pledged
to
bring
the
royal
ordinance
that
evening
and
the
old
furrier
went
and
came
from
the
hall
to
the
door
in
a
state
of
impatience
which
showed
how
great
his
ambition
had
been
ambroise
at
last
appeared
my
old
friend
cried
the
surgeon
in
an
agitated
manner
with
a
glance
at
the
supper
table
let
me
see
your
linen
good
oh
you
must
have
wax
candles
quick
quick
get
out
your
best
things
why
what
is
it
all
about
asked
the
rector
of
the
and
the
young
king
are
coming
to
sup
with
you
replied
the
surgeon
they
are
only
waiting
for
an
old
counsellor
who
agreed
to
sell
his
place
to
christophe
and
with
whom
monsieur
de
thou
has
concluded
a
bargain
don
t
appear
to
know
anything
i
have
escaped
from
the
louvre
to
warn
in
a
second
the
whole
family
were
astir
christophe
s
mother
and
babette
s
aunt
bustled
about
with
the
celerity
of
housekeepers
suddenly
surprised
but
in
spite
of
the
apparent
confusion
into
which
the
news
had
thrown
the
entire
family
the
precautions
were
promptly
made
with
an
activity
that
was
nothing
short
of
marvellous
christophe
amazed
and
confounded
by
such
a
favor
was
speechless
gazing
mechanically
at
what
went
on
the
queen
and
king
here
in
our
house
said
the
old
mother
the
queen
repeated
babette
what
must
we
say
and
do
in
less
than
an
hour
all
was
changed
the
hall
was
decorated
the
sparkled
presently
the
noise
of
horses
sounded
in
the
street
the
light
of
torches
carried
by
the
horsemen
of
the
escort
brought
all
the
burghers
of
the
neighborhood
to
their
windows
the
noise
soon
subsided
and
the
escort
rode
away
leaving
the
and
her
son
king
charles
charles
de
gondi
now
of
the
wardrobe
and
governor
of
the
king

of

old
counsellor

two
pages
under
the
arcade
before

door

the
queen
as
she
entered
the
king

son
and
i
have
come
to
sign
the
of
the
son
of
my
furrier
but
only
on
condition
that
he
remains
a
catholic
a
man
must
be
a
catholic
to
enter
parliament
he
must
be
a
catholic
to
own
land
which
derives
from
the
crown
he
must
be
a
catholic
if
he
would
sit
at
the
king
s
table
that
is
so
is
it
not
pinard
the
secretary
of
state
entered
and
showed
the
if
we
are
not
all
catholics
said
the
little
king
pinard
will
throw
those
papers
into
the
fire
but
we
are
all
catholics
here
i
think
he
continued
casting
his
somewhat
haughty
eyes
over
the
company
yes
sire
replied
christophe
bending
his
injured
knees
with
difficulty
and
kissing
the
hand
which
the
king
held
out
to
him
queen
catherine
stretched
out
her
hand
to
christophe
and
raising
him
hastily
drew
him
aside
into
a
corner
saying
in
a
low
voice
ah
ca
my
lad
no
evasions
here
are
you
playing
now
yes
madame
he
answered
won
by
the
dazzling
reward
and
the
honor
done
him
by
the
grateful
queen
very
good
monsieur
lecamus
the
king
my
son

and
said
i

well

up
the
deed
notary
said
pinard
inasmuch
as
the
king
our
master
does
us
the
favor
to

my
daughter

marriage
contract
cried
lallier
i
will
pay
the
whole
price
of

said
the
young
king
graciously
as
a
wedding
present
to
the
bride
i
remit
with
my
mother
s
consent
all
my
dues
and
rights
in
the
old
lecamus
and
lallier
fell
on
their
knees
and
kissed
the
king
s
hand
sire
what
quantities
of
money
these
burghers
have
whispered
de
gondi
in
his
ear
the
young
king
laughed
as
their
highnesses
are
so
kind
said
old
lecamus
will
they
permit
me
to
present
to
them
my
successor
and
ask
them
to
continue
to
him
the
royal
patent
of
furrier
to
their
majesties
let
us
see
him
said
the
king
lecamus
led
forward
his
successor
who
was
livid
with
fear
if
my
mother
consents
we
will
now
sit
down
to
table
said
the
little
king
old
lecamus
had
bethought
himself
of
presenting
to
the
king
a
silver
goblet
which
he
had
bought
of
benvenuto
cellini
when
the
latter
stayed
in
paris
at
the
hotel
de
nesle
this
treasure
of
art
had
cost
the
furrier
no
less
than
two
thousand
crowns
oh
my
dear
mother
see
this
beautiful
work
cried
the
young
king
lifting
the
goblet
by
its
stem
it
was
made
in
florence
replied
catherine
pardon
me
madame
said
lecamus
it
was
made
in
paris
by
a
florentine
all
that
is
made
in
florence
would
belong
to
your
majesty
that
which
is
made
in
france
is
the
king
i
accept
it
my
good
man
cried
charles
ix
and
it
shall
henceforth
be
my
particular
drinking
it
is
beautiful
enough
said
the
queen
examining
the
masterpiece
to
be
included
among
the
well
maitre
ambroise
she
whispered
in
the
surgeon
s
ear
with
a
glance
at
christophe
have
you
taken
good
care
of
him
will
he
walk
again
he
will
run
replied
the
surgeon
smiling
ah
you
have
cleverly
made
him
a
ha
said
the
queen
with
the
levity
for
which
she
has
been
blamed
though
it
was
only
on
the
surface
the
church
won
t
stand
still
for
want
of
one
monk
the
supper
was
gay
the
queen
thought
babette
pretty
and
in
the
regal
manner
which
was
natural
to
her
she
slipped
upon
the
girl
s
finger
a
diamond
ring
which
compensated
in
value
for
the
goblet
bestowed
upon
the
king
charles
who
afterwards
became
rather
too
fond
of
these
invasions
of
burgher
homes
supped
with
a
good
appetite
then
at
a
word
from
his
new
governor
who
it
is
said
was
instructed
to
make
him
forget
the
virtuous

in

when

in
the
reign
of
louis
that
magnificent
mansion
which
shares
with
the
hotel
lambert
the
admiration
of
parisians
and
foreigners
and
was
assuredly
one
of
the
finest
buildings
in
paris
it
may
still
be
seen
in
the
rue
thorigny
though
at
the
beginning
of
the

it
was
pillaged
as
having
belonged
to

all

destroyed

this

is
reached
through
the

shows
the
noble
results
obtained
in

may
be
doubted
whether
modern

brought
about

were
sitting
on
the
roof
of
a
house
in
the
rue
at
the
edge
of
a
gutter
this
gutter
was
one
of
those
stone
channels
which
in
former
days
were
constructed
below
the
roofs
of
houses
to
receive
the
discharging

at
regular
intervals

those
long
gargoyles
carved
in
the
shape

fantastic
animals
with
gaping
mouths
in
spite
of
the
zeal
with
which
our
present
general
pulls
down
and
demolishes
venerable
buildings

still
existed
many
of
these
projecting
gutters
until
quite
recently
an
ordinance
of
the

to
disappear

even
so
a

of

in

where
low
rents
and
values
hinder
the
building
of
new
storeys
under
the
eaves
of
the
roofs
it
certainly
seems
strange
that
two
personages
invested
with
such
important
offices
should
be
playing
the
part
of
cats
but
whosoever
will
burrow
into
the
historic
treasures
of
those
days
when
personal
interests
jostled
and
thwarted
each
other
around
the
throne
till
the
whole
political
centre
of
france
was
like
a
skein
of
tangled
thread
will
readily
understand
that
the
two
florentines
were
cats
indeed
and
very
much
in
their
places
in
a
gutter
their
devotion
to
the
person
of
the
catherine
de
medici
who
had
brought
them
to
the
court
of
france
and
foisted
them
into
their
high
offices
compelled
them
not
to
recoil
before
any
of
the
consequences
of
their
intrusion
but
to
explain
how
and
why
these
courtiers
were
thus
perched
it
is
necessary
to
relate
a
scene
which
had
taken
place
an
hour
earlier
not
far
from
this
very
gutter
in
that
beautiful
brown
room
of
the
louvre
all
that
now
remains
to
us
of
the
apartments
of
henri
in
which
after
supper
the
courtiers
had
been
paying
court
to
the
two
queens
catherine
de
medici
and
elizabeth
of
austria
and
to
their
son
and
husband
king
charles
ix
in
those
days
the
majority
of
the
burghers
and
great
lords
supped
at
six
or
at
seven
o
clock
but
the
more
refined
and
elegant
supped
at
eight
or
even
nine
this
repast
was
the
dinner
of
many
persons
erroneously
believe
that
etiquette
was
invented
by
louis
xiv
on
the
contrary
it
was
introduced
into
france
by
catherine
de
medici
who
made
it
so
severe
that
the
connetable
de
montmorency
had
more
difficulty
in
obtaining
permission
to
enter
the
court
of
the
louvre
on
horseback
than
in
winning
his
sword
moreover
that
distinction
was
granted
to
him
only
on
account
of
his
great
age
etiquette
which
was
it
is
true
slightly
relaxed
under
the
first
two
bourbon
kings
took
an
oriental
form
under
the
great
monarch
for
it
was
introduced
from
the
eastern
empire
which
derived
it
from
persia
in
few
persons
had
the
right
to
enter
the
courtyard
of
the
louvre
with
their
servants
and
torches
under
louis
xiv
the
coaches
of
none
but
dukes
and
peers
were
allowed
to
pass
under
the
peristyle
moreover
the
cost
of
obtaining
entrance
after
supper
to
the
royal
apartments
was
very
heavy
the
marechal
de
retz
whom
we
have
just
seen
perched
on
a
gutter
offered
on
one
occasion
a
thousand
crowns
of
that
day
six
thousand
francs
of
our
present
money
to
the
usher
of
the
king
s
cabinet
to
be
allowed
to
speak
to
henri
iii
on
a
day
when
he
was
not
on
duty
to
an
historian
who
knows
the
truth
it
is
laughable
to
see
the
picture
of
the
courtyard
at
blois
in
which
the
artist
has
introduced
a
courtier
on
horseback
on
the
present
occasion
therefore
none
but
the
most
eminent
personages
in
the
kingdom
were
in
the
royal
apartments
the
queen
elizabeth
of
austria
and
her
catherine
de
medici
were
seated
together
on
the
left
of
the
fireplace
on
the
other
side
sat
the
king
buried
in
an
affecting
a
lethargy
consequent
on
digestion
for
he
had
just
supped
like
a
prince
returned
from
hunting
possibly
he
was
seeking
to
avoid
conversation
in
presence
of
so
many
persons
who
were
spies
upon
his
thoughts
the
courtiers
stood
erect
and
uncovered
at
the
end
of
the
room
some
talked
in
a
low
voice
others
watched
the
king
awaiting
the
bestowal
of
a
look
or
a
word
occasionally
one
was
called
up
by
the
who
talked
with
him
for
a
few
moments
another
risked
saying
a
word
to
the
king
who
replied
with
either
a
nod
or
a
brief
sentence
a
german
nobleman
the
comte
de
solern
stood
at
the
corner
of

fireplace
behind

young
queen

he

to

lords

catherine
and
charles
ix
watched
each
other
with
close
attention
at
this
gloomy
court
as
gloomy
as
the
room
in
which
it
was
held
each
individual
had
his
or
her
own
reasons
for
being
sad
or
thoughtful
the
young
queen
elizabeth
was
a
prey
to
the
tortures
of
jealousy
and
could
them
though
she
smiled
upon
her
husband
whom
she
passionately
adored

and
pious

that
she
was
marie

only
mistress
charles

had
and
to
whom
he
was
loyally
faithful

lately
returned
from
the
chateau
de
fayet
in
dauphine
whither
she
had
gone
to
give
birth
to
a
child

brought
back
to
charles
ix
a
son
his
only
son
charles
de

first
comte
d
auvergne
and
afterward
duc
d
angouleme
the
poor
queen
in
addition
to
the
mortification
of
her
abandonment
now
endured
the
pang
of
knowing
that
her
rival
had
borne
a
son
to
her
husband
while
she
had
brought
him
only
a
daughter
and
these
were
not
her
only
troubles
and
disillusions
for
catherine
de
medici
who
had
seemed
her
friend
in
the
first
instance
now
out
of
policy
favored
her
betrayal
preferring
to
serve
the
mistress
rather
than
the
wife
of
the
king
for
the
following
reason
when
charles
ix
openly
avowed
his
passion
for
marie
touchet
catherine
showed
favor
to
the
girl
in
the
interests
of
her
own
desire
for
domination
marie
touchet
who
was
very
young
when
brought
to
court
came
at
an
age
when
all
the
noblest
sentiments
are
predominant
she
loved
the
king
for
himself
alone
frightened
at
the
fate
to
which
ambition
had
led
the
duchesse
de
valentinois
better
known
as
diane
de
poitiers
she
dreaded
the
and
greatly
preferred
her
simple
happiness
to
grandeur
perhaps
she
thought
that
lovers
as
young
as
the
king
and
herself
could
never
struggle
successfully
against
the
as
the
daughter
of
jean
touchet
sieur
de
beauvais
and
quillard
she
was
born
between
the
burgher
class
and
the
lower
nobility
she
had
none
of
the
inborn
ambitions
of
the
pisseleus
and
girls
of
rank
who
battled
for
their
families
with
the
hidden
weapons
of
love
marie
touchet
without
family
or
friends
spared
catherine
de
medici
all
antagonism
with
her
son
s
mistress
the
daughter
of
a
great
house
would
have
been
her
rival
jean
touchet
the
father
one
of
the
finest
wits
of
the
time
a
man
to
whom
poets
dedicated
their
works
wanted
nothing
at
court
marie
a
young
girl
without
connections
intelligent
and
and
also
simple
and
artless
whose
desires
would
probably
never
be
aggressive
to
the
royal
power
suited
the
admirably
in
short
she
made
the
parliament
recognize
the
son
to
whom
marie
touchet
had
just
given
birth
in
the
month
of
april
and
she
allowed
him
to
take
the
title
of
comte
d
auvergne
assuring
charles
ix
that
she
would
leave
the
boy
her
personal
property
the
counties
of
auvergne
and
laraguais
at
a
later
period
marguerite
de
valois
queen
of
navarre
contested
this
legacy
after
she
was
queen
of
france
and
the
parliament
annulled
it
but
later
still
louis
out
of
respect
for
the
valois
blood
indemnified
the
comte
d
auvergne
by
the
gift
of
the
duchy
of
angouleme
catherine
had
already
given
marie
touchet
who
asked
nothing
the
manor
of
belleville
an
estate
close
to
vincennes
which
carried
no
title
and
thither
she
went
whenever
the
king
hunted
and
spent
the
night
at
the
castle
it
was
in
this
gloomy
fortress
that
charles
ix
passed
the
greater
part
of
his
last
years
ending
his
life
there
according
to
some
historians
as
louis
xii
had
ended
his
the
kept
close
watch
upon
her
son
all
the
occupations
of
his
personal
life
outside
of
politics
were
reported
to
her
the
king
had
begun
to
look
upon
his
mother
as
an
enemy
but
the
kind
intentions
she
expressed
toward
his
son
diverted
his
suspicions
for
a
time
catherine
s
motives
in
this
matter
were
never
understood
by
queen
elizabeth
who
according
to
brantome
was
one
of
the
gentlest
queens
that
ever
reigned
who
never
did
harm
or
even
gave
pain
to
any
one
and
was
careful
to
read
her
but
this
princess
began
at
last
to
see
the
precipices
yawning
around
the
throne
a
dreadful
discovery
which
might
indeed
have
made
her
quail
it
was
some
such
remembrance
no
doubt
that
led
her
to
say
to
one
of
her
ladies
after
the
death
of
the
king
in
reply
to
a
condolence
that
she
had
no
son
and
could
not
therefore
be
regent
and
ah
i
thank
god
that
i
have
no
son
i
know
well
what
would
have
happened
my
poor
son
would
have
been
despoiled
and
wronged
like
the
king
my
husband
and
i
should
have
been
the
cause
of
it
god
had
mercy
on
the
state
he
has
done
all
for
the
this
princess
whose
portrait
brantome
thinks
he
draws
by
saying
that
her
complexion
was
as
beautiful
and
delicate
as
the
ladies
of
her
suite
were
charming
and
agreeable
and
that
her
figure
was
fine
though
rather
short
was
of
little
account
at
her
own
court
suffering
from
a
double
grief
her
saddened
attitude
added
another
gloomy
tone
to
a
scene
which
most
young
queens
less
cruelly
injured
might
have
enlivened
the
pious
elizabeth
proved
at
this
crisis
that
the
qualities
which
are
the
shining
glory
of
women
in
the
ordinary
ways
of
life
can
be
fatal
to
a
sovereign
a
princess
able
to
occupy
herself
with
other
things
besides
her
might
have
been
a
useful
helper
to
charles
who
found
no
prop
to
lean
on
either
in
his
wife
or
in
his
mistress
the
as
she
sat
there
in
that
brown
room
was
closely
observing
the
king
who
during
supper
had
exhibited
a
boisterous
which
she
felt
to
be
assumed
in
order
to
mask
some
intention
against
her
this
sudden
gaiety
contrasted
too
vividly
with
the
struggle
of
mind
he
endeavored
to
conceal
by
his
eagerness
in
hunting
and
by
an
almost
maniacal
toil
at
his
forge
where
he
spent
many
hours
in
hammering
iron
and
catherine
was
not
deceived
by
it
without
being
able
even
to
guess
which
of
the
statesmen
about
the
king
was
employed
to
prepare
or
negotiate
it
for
charles
ix
contrived
to
mislead
his
mother
s
spies
catherine
felt
no
doubt
whatever
that
some
scheme
for
her
overthrow
was
being
planned
the
presence
of
tavannes
who
arrived
at
the
same
time
as
strozzi
whom
she
herself
had
summoned
gave
her
food
for
thought
strong
in
the
strength
of
her
political
combination
catherine
was
above
the
reach
of
circumstances
but
she
was
powerless
against
some
hidden
violence
as
many
persons
are
ignorant
of
the
actual
state
of
public
affairs
then
so
complicated
by
the
various
parties
that
distracted
france
the
leaders
of
which
had
each
their
private
interests
to
carry
out
it
is
necessary
to
describe
in
a
few
words
the
perilous
game
in
which
the
was
now
engaged
to
show
catherine
de
medici
in
a
new
light
is
in
fact
the
root
and
stock
of
our
present
history
two
words
explain
this
woman
so
curiously
interesting
to
study
a
woman
whose
influence
has
left
such
deep
impressions
upon
france
those
words
are
power
and
astrology
exclusively
ambitious
catherine
de
medici
had
no
other
passion
than
that
of
power
superstitious
and
fatalistic
like
so
many
superior
men
she
had
no
sincere
belief
except
in
occult
sciences
unless
this
double
mainspring
is
known
the
conduct
of
catherine
de
medici
will
remain
forever
misunderstood
as
we
picture
her
faith
in
judicial
astrology
the
light
will
fall
upon
two
personages
who
are
in
fact
the
philosophical
subjects
of
this
study
there
lived
a
man
for
whom
catherine
cared
more
than
for
any
of
her
children
his
name
was
cosmo
ruggiero
he
lived
in
a
house
belonging
to
her
the
hotel
de
soissons
she
made
him
her
supreme
adviser
it
was
his
duty
to
tell
her
whether
the
stars
ratified
the
advice
and
judgment
of
her
ordinary
counsellors
certain
remarkable
antecedents
warranted
the
power
which
cosmo
ruggiero
retained
over
his
mistress
to
her
last
hour
one
of
the
most
learned
men
of
the
sixteenth
century
was
physician
to
lorenzo
de
medici
duc
d
urbino
catherine
s
father
this
physician
was
called
ruggiero
the
elder
vecchio
ruggier
and
roger
l
ancien
in
the
french
authors
who
have
written
on
alchemy
to
distinguish
him
from
his
two
sons
lorenzo
ruggiero
called
the
great
by
cabalistic
writers
and
cosmo
ruggiero
catherine
s
astrologer
also
called
roger
by
several
french
historians
in
france
it
was
the
custom
to
pronounce
the
name
in
general
as
ruggieri
ruggiero
the
elder
was
so
highly
valued
by
the
medici
that
the
two
dukes
cosmo
and
lorenzo
stood
godfathers
to
his
two
sons
he
cast
in
concert
with
the
famous
mathematician
basilio
the
horoscope
of
catherine
s
nativity
in
his
official
capacity
as
mathematicion
astrologer
and
physician
to
the
house
of
medici
three
offices
which
are
often
confounded
at
the
period
of
which
we
write
the
occult
sciences
were
studied
with
an
ardor
that
may
surprise
the
incredulous
minds
of
our
own
age
which
is
supremely
analytical
perhaps
such
minds
may
find
in
this
historical
sketch
the
dawn
or
rather
the
germ
of
the
positive
sciences
which
have
flowered
in
the
nineteenth
century
though
without
the
poetic
grandeur
given
to
them
by
the
audacious
seekers
of
the
sixteenth
who
instead
of
using
them
solely
for
mechanical
industries
magnified
art
and
fertilized
thought
by
their
means
the
protection
universally
given
to
occult
science
by
the
sovereigns
of
those
days
was
justified
by
the
noble
creations
of
many
inventors
who
starting
in
quest
of
the
great
work
the
philosophers
stone
attained
to
astonishing
results
at
no
period
were
the
sovereigns
of
the
world
more
eager
for
the
study
of
these
mysteries
the
fuggers
of
augsburg
in
whom
all
modern
luculluses
will
recognize
their
princes
and
all
bankers
their
masters
were
gifted
with
powers
of
calculation
it
would
be
difficult
to
surpass
well
those
practical
men
who
loaned
the
funds
of
all
europe
to
the
sovereigns
of
the
sixteenth
century
as
deeply
in
debt
as
the
kings
of
the
present
day
those
illustrious
guests
of
charles
were
sleeping
partners
in
the
crucibles
of
paracelsus
at
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
ruggiero
the
elder
was
the
head
of
that
secret
university
from
which
issued
the
cardans
the
nostradamuses
and
the
agrippas
all
in
their
turn
physicians
of
the
house
of
valois
also
the
astronomers
astrologers
and
alchemists
who
surrounded
the
princes
of
christendom
and
were
more
especially
welcomed
and
protected
in
france
by
catherine
de
medici
in
the
nativity
drawn
by
basilio
and
ruggiero
the
elder
the
principal
events
of
catherine
s
life
were
foretold
with
a
correctness
which
is
quite
disheartening
for
those
who
deny
the
power
of
occult
science
this
horoscope
predicted
the
misfortunes
which
during
the
siege
of
florence
imperilled
the
beginning
of
her
life
also
her
marriage
with
a
son
of
the
king
of
france
the
unexpected
succession
of
that
son
to
his
father
s
throne
the
birth
of
her
children
their
number
and
the
fact
that
three
of
her
sons
would
be
kings
in
succession
that
two
of
her
daughters
would
be
queens
and
that
all
of
them
were
destined
to
die
without
posterity
this
prediction
was
so
fully
realized
that
many
historians
have
assumed
that
it
was
written
after
the
events
it
is
well
known
that
nostradamus
took
to
the
chateau
de
chaumont
whither
catherine
went
after
the
conspiracy
of
la
renaudie
a
woman
who
possessed
the
faculty
of
reading
the
future
now
during
the
reign
of
francois
while
the
queen
had
with
her
her
four
sons
all
young
and
in
good
health
and
before
the
marriage
of
her
daughter
elizabeth
with
philip
king
of
spain
or
that
of
her
daughter
marguerite
with
henri
de
bourbon
king
of
navarre
afterward
henri
iv
nostradamus
and
this
woman
reiterated
the
circumstances
formerly
predicted
in
the
famous
nativity
this
woman
who
was
no
doubt
gifted
with
second
sight
and
who
belonged
to
the
great
school
of
seekers
of
the
great
work
though
the
particulars
of
her
life
and
name
are
lost
to
history
stated
that
the
last
crowned
child
would
be
assassinated
having
placed
the
in
front
of
a
magic
mirror
in
which
was
reflected
a
wheel
on
the
several
spokes
of
which
were
the
faces
of
her
children
the
sorceress
set
the
wheel
revolving
and
catherine
counted
the
number
of
revolutions
which
it
made
each
revolution
was
for
each
son
one
year
of
his
reign
henri
iv
was
also
put
upon
the
wheel
which
then
made
rounds
and
the
woman
some
historians
have
said
it
was
a
man
told
the
frightened
queen
that
henri
de
bourbon
would
be
king
of
france
and
reign
that
number
of
years
from
that
time
forth
catherine
de
medici
vowed
a
mortal
hatred
to
the
man
whom
she
knew
would
succeed
the
last
of
her
valois
sons
who
was
to
die
assassinated
anxious
to
know
what
her
own
death
would
be
she
was
warned
to
beware
of
supposing
therefore
that
she
would
be
either
put
to
death
or
imprisoned
in
the
chateau
de
she
would
never
so
much
as
put
her
foot
there
although
that
residence
was
far
more
convenient
for
her
political
plans
owing
to
its
proximity
to
paris
than
the
other
castles
to
which
she
retreated
with
the
king
during
the
troubles
when
she
was
taken
suddenly
ill
a
few
days
after
the
murder
of
the
duc
de
guise
at
blois
she
asked
the
name
of
the
bishop
who
came
to
assist
her
being
told
it
was
she
cried
out
i
am
dead
and
did
actually
die
on
the
morrow
having
moreover
lived
the
exact
number
of
years
given
to
her
by
all
her
horoscopes
these
predictions
which
were
known
to
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
who
regarded
them
as
witchcraft
were
now
in
process
of
realization
francois
ii
had
reigned
his
two
revolutions
of
the
wheel
and
charles
ix
was
now
making
his
last
turn
if
catherine
said
the
strange
words
which
history
has
attributed
to
her
when
her
son
henri
started
for
poland
you
will
soon
return
they
must
be
set
down
to
her
faith
in
occult
science
and
not
to
the
intention
of
poisoning
charles
ix
many
other
circumstances
corroborated
catherine
s
faith
in
the
occult
sciences
the
night
before
the
tournament
at
which
henri
ii
was
killed
catherine
saw
the
fatal
blow
in
a
dream
her
astrological
council
then
composed
of
nostradamus
and
the
two
ruggieri
had
already
predicted
to
her
the
death
of
the
king
history
has
recorded
the
efforts
made
by
catherine
to
persuade
her
husband
not
to
enter
the
lists
the
prognostic
and
the
dream
produced
by
the
prognostic
were
verified
the
memoirs
of
the
day
relate
another
fact
that
was
no
less
singular
the
courier
who
announced
the
victory
of
moncontour
arrived
in
the
night
after
riding
with
such
speed
that
he
killed
three
horses
the
was
awakened
to
receive
the
news
to
which
she
replied
i
knew
it
in
fact
as
brantome
relates
she
had
told
of
her
son
s
triumph
the
evening
before
and
narrated
several
circumstances
of
the
battle
the
astrologer
of
the
house
of
bourbon
predicted
that
the
youngest
of
all
the
princes
descended
from
the
son
of
antoine
de
bourbon
would
ascend
the
throne
of
france
this
prediction
related
by
sully
was
accomplished
in
the
precise
terms
of
the
horoscope
which
led
henri
iv
to
say
that
by
dint
of
lying
these
people
sometimes
hit
the
truth
however
that
may
be
if
most
of
the
great
minds
of
that
epoch
believed
in
this
vast
science
called
magic
by
the
masters
of
judicial
astrology
and
sorcery
by
the
public
they
were
justified
in
doing
so
by
the
fulfilment
of
horoscopes
it
was
for
the
use
of
cosmo
ruggiero
her
mathematician
astronomer
and
astrologer
that
catherine
de
medici
erected
the
tower
behind
the
halle
aux
bles
all
that
now
remains
of
the
hotel
de
soissons
cosmo
ruggiero
possessed
like
confessors
a
mysterious
influence
the
possession
of
which
like
them
again
sufficed
him
he
cherished
an
ambitious
thought
superior
to
all
vulgar
ambitions
this
man
whom
dramatists
and
depict
as
a
juggler
owned
the
rich
abbey
of
in
lower
brittany
and
refused
many
high
ecclesiastical
dignities
the
gold
which
the
superstitious
passions
of
the
age
poured
into
his
coffers
sufficed
for
his
secret
enterprise
and
the
queen
s
hand
stretched
above
his
head
preserved
every
hair
of
it
from
danger
ii
schemes
against
schemes
the
thirst
for
power
which
consumed
the
her
desire
for
dominion
was
so
great
that
in
order
to
retain
it
she
had
as
we
have
seen
allied
herself
to
the
guises
those
enemies
of
the
throne
to
keep
the
reins
of
power
now
obtained
within
her
hands
she
was
using
every
means
even
to
the
sacrifice
of
her
friends
and
that
of
her
children
this
woman
of
whom
one
of
her
enemies
said
at
her
death
it
is
more
than
a
queen
it
is
monarchy
itself
that
has
died
this
woman
could
not
exist
without
the
intrigues
of
government
as
a
gambler
can
live
only
by
the
emotions
of
play
although
she
was
an
italian
of
the
voluptuous
race
of
the
medici
the
calvinists
who
calumniated
her
never
accused
her
of
having
a
lover
a
great
admirer
of
the
maxim
divide
to
reign
she
had
learned
the
art
of
perpetually
pitting
one
force
against
another
no
sooner
had
she
grasped
the
reins
of
power
than
she
was
forced
to
keep
up
dissensions
in
order
to
neutralize
the
strength
of
two
rival
houses
and
thus
save
the
crown
catherine
invented
the
game
of
political
since
imitated
by
all
princes
who
find
themselves
in
a
like
situation
by
instigating
first
the
calvinists
against
the
guises
and
then
the
guises
against
the
calvinists
next
after
pitting
the
two
religions
against
each
other
in
the
heart
of
the
nation
catherine
instigated
the
duc
d
anjou
against
his
brother
charles
ix
after
neutralizing
events
by
opposing
them
to
one
another
she
neutralized
men
by
holding
the
thread
of
all
their
interests
in
her
hands
but
so
fearful
a
game
which
needs
the
head
of
a
louis
xi
to
play
it
draws
down
inevitably
the
hatred
of
all
parties
upon
the
player
who
condemns
himself
forever
to
the
necessity
of
conquering
for
one
lost
game
will
turn
every
selfish
interest
into
an
enemy
the
greater
part
of
the
reign
of
charles
ix
witnessed
the
triumph
of
the
domestic
policy
of
this
astonishing
woman
what
adroit
persuasion
must
catherine
have
employed
to
have
obtained
the
command
of
the
armies
for
the
duc
d
anjou
under
a
young
and
brave
king
thirsting
for
glory
capable
of
military
achievement
generous
and
in
presence
too
of
the
connetable
de
montmorency
in
the
eyes
of
the
statesmen
of
europe
the
duc
d
anjou
had
all
the
honors
of
the
and
charles
ix
all
the
odium
after
inspiring
the
king
with
a
false
and
secret
jealousy
of
his
brother
she
used
that
passion
to
wear
out
by
the
intrigues
of
fraternal
jealousy
the
really
noble
qualities
of
charles
ix
cypierre
the
king
s
first
governor
and
amyot
his
first
tutor
had
made
him
so
great
a
man
they
had
paved
the
way
for
so
noble
a
reign
that
the
began
to
hate
her
son
as
soon
as
she
found
reason
to
fear
the
loss
of
the
power
she
had
so
slowly
and
so
painfully
obtained
on
these
general
grounds
most
historians
have
believed
that
catherine
de
medici
felt
a
preference
for
henri
iii
but
her
conduct
at
the
period
of
which
we
are
now
writing
proves
the
absolute
indifference
of
her
heart
toward
all
her
children
when
the
duc
d
anjou
went
to
reign
in
poland
catherine
was
deprived
of
the
instrument
by
which
she
had
worked
to
keep
the
king
s
passions
occupied
in
domestic
intrigues
which
neutralized
his
energy
in
other
directions
she
then
set
up
the
conspiracy
of
la
mole
and
coconnas
in
which
her
youngest
son
the
duc
d
alencon
afterwards
duc
d
anjou
on
the
accession
of
henri
iii
took
part
lending
himself
very
willingly
to
his
mother
s
wishes
and
displaying
an
ambition
much
encouraged
by
his
sister
marguerite
then
queen
of
navarre
this
secret
conspiracy
had
now
reached
the
point
to
which
catherine
sought
to
bring
it
its
object
was
to
put
the
young
duke
and
his
the
king
of
navarre
at
the
head
of
the
calvinists
to
seize
the
person
of
charles
and
imprison
that
king
without
an
heir
leaving
the
throne
to
the
duc
d
alencon
whose
intention
it
was
to
establish
calvinism
as
the
religion
of
france
calvin
as
we
have
already
said
had
obtained
a
few
days
before
his
death
the
reward
he
had
so
deeply
coveted
the
reformation
was
now
called
calvinism
in
his
honor
if
le
laboureur
and
other
sensible
writers
had
not
already
proved
that
la
mole
and
coconnas
arrested
fifty
nights
after
the
day
on
which
our
present
history
begins
and
beheaded
the
following
april
even
we
say
if
it
had
not
been
made
historically
clear
that
these
men
were
the
victims
of
the
s
policy
the
part
which
cosmo
ruggiero
took
in
this
affair
would
go
far
to
show
that
she
secretly
directed
their
enterprise
ruggiero
against
whom
the
king
had
suspicions
and
for
whom
he
cherished
a
hatred
the
motives
of
which
we
are
about
to
explain
was
included
in
the
prosecution
he
admitted
having
given
to
la
mole
a
wax
figure
representing
the
king
which
was
pierced
through
the
heart
by
two
needles
this
method
of
casting
spells
constituted
a
crime
which
in
those
days
was
punished
by
death
it
presents
one
of
the
most
startling
and
infernal
images
of
hatred
that
humanity
could
invent
it
pictures
admirably
the
magnetic
and
terrible
working
in
the
occult
world
of
a
constant
malevolent
desire
surrounding
the
person
doomed
to
death
the
effects
of
which
on
the
person
are
exhibited
by
the
figure
of
wax
the
law
in
those
days
thought
and
thought
justly
that
a
desire
to
which
an
actual
form
was
given
should
be
regarded
as
a
crime
of
charles
ix
demanded
the
death
of
ruggiero
catherine
more
powerful
than
her
son
obtained
from
the
parliament
through
the
young
counsellor
lecamus
a
commutation
of
the
sentence
and
cosmo
was
sent
to
the
galleys
the
following
year
on
the
death
of
the
king
he
was
pardoned
by
a
decree
of
henri
who
restored
his
pension
and
received
him
at
court
but
to
return
now
to
the
moment
of
which
we
are
writing
catherine
had
by
this
time
struck
so
many
blows
on
the
heart
of
her
son
that
he
was
eagerly
desirous
of
casting
off
her
yoke
during
the
absence
of
marie
touchet
charles
deprived
of
his
usual
occupation
had
taken
to
observing
everything
about
him
he
cleverly
set
traps
for
the
persons
in
whom
he
trusted
most
in
order
to
test
their
fidelity
he
spied
on
his
mother
s
actions
concealing
from
her
all
knowledge
of
his
own
employing
for
this
deception
the
evil
qualities
she
had
fostered
in
him
consumed
by
a
desire
to
blot
out
the
horror
excited
in
france
by
the
he
busied
himself
actively
in
public
affairs
he
presided
at
the
council
and
tried
to
seize
the
reins
of
government
by
schemes
though
the
endeavored
to
check
these
attempts
of
her
son
by
employing
all
the
means
of
influence
over
his
mind
which
her
maternal
authority
and
a
long
habit
of
domineering
gave
her
his
rush
into
distrust
was
so
vehement
that
he
went
too
far
at
the
first
bound
ever
to
return
from
it
the
day
on
which
his
mother
s
speech
to
the
king
of
poland
was
reported
to
him
charles
conscious
of
his
failing
health
conceived
the
most
horrible
suspicions
and
when
such
thoughts
take
possession
of
the
mind
of
a
son
and
a
king
nothing
can
remove
them
in
fact
on
his
deathbed
at
the
moment
when
he
confided
his
wife
and
daughter
to
henri
he
began
to
put
the
latter
on
his
guard
against
catherine
so
that
she
cried
out
passionately
endeavoring
to
silence
him
do
not
say
that
monsieur
though
charles
ix
never
ceased
to
show
her
the
outward
respect
of
which
she
was
so
tenacious
that
she
would
never
call
the
kings
her
sons
anything
but
monsieur
the
had
detected
in
her
son
s
manner
during
the
last
few
months
an
purpose
of
vengeance
but
clever
indeed
must
be
the
man
who
counted
on
taking
catherine
unawares
she
held
ready
in
her
hand
at
this
moment
the
conspiracy
of
the
duke
d
alencon
and
la
mole
in
order
to
counteract
by
another
fraternal
struggle
the
efforts
charles
ix
was
making
toward
emancipation
but
before
employing
this
means
she
wanted
to
remove
his
distrust
of
her
which
would
render
impossible
their
future
reconciliation
for
was
he
likely
to
restore
power
to
the
hands
of
a
mother
whom
he
thought
capable
of
poisoning
him
she
felt
herself
at
this
moment
in
such
serious
danger
that
she
had
sent
for
strozzi
her
relation
and
a
soldier
noted
for
his
promptitude
of
action
she
took
counsel
in
secret
with
birago
and
the
two
gondis
and
never
did
she
so
frequently
consult
her
oracle
cosmo
ruggiero
as
at
the
present
crisis
though
the
habit
of
dissimulation
together
with
advancing
age
had
given
the
that
abbess
face
with
its
haughty
and
macerated
mask
expressionless
yet
full
of
depth
inscrutable
yet
vigilant
remarked
by
all
who
have
studied
her
portrait
the
courtiers
now
observed
some
clouds
on
her
icy
countenance
no
sovereign
was
ever
so
imposing
as
this
woman
from
the
day
when
she
succeeded
in
restraining
the
guises
after
the
death
of
francois
ii
her
black
velvet
cap
made
with
a
point
upon
the
forehead
for
she
never
relinquished
her
widow
s
mourning
seemed
a
species
of
feminine
cowl
around
the
cold
imperious
face
to
which
however
she
knew
how
to
give
at
the
right
moment
a
seductive
italian
charm
catherine
de
medici
was
so
well
made
that
she
was
accused
of
inventing
to
show
the
shape
of
her
legs
which
were
absolutely
perfect
women
followed
her
example
in
this
respect
throughout
europe
which
even
then
took
its
fashions
from
france
those
who
desire
to
bring
this
grand
figure
before
their
minds
will
find
that
the
scene
now
taking
place
in
the
brown
hall
of
the
louvre
presents
it
in
a
striking
aspect
the
two
queens
different
in
spirit
in
beauty
in
dress
and
now
estranged
one
naive
and
thoughtful
the
other
thoughtful
and
gravely
abstracted
were
far
too
preoccupied
to
think
of
giving
the
order
awaited
by
the
courtiers
for
the
amusements
of
the
evening
the
carefully
concealed
drama
played
for
the
last
six
months
by
the
mother
and
son
was
more
than
suspected
by
many
of
the
courtiers
but
the
italians
were
watching
it
with
special
anxiety
for
catherine
s
failure
involved
their
ruin
during
this
evening
charles
weary
with
the
day
s
hunting
looked
to
be
forty
years
old
he
had
reached
the
last
stages
of
the
malady
of
which
he
died
the
symptoms
of
which
were
such
that
many
reflecting
persons
were
justified
in
thinking
that
he
was
poisoned
according
to
de
thou
the
tacitus
of
the
valois
the
surgeons
found
suspicious
spots
causa
incognita
reperti
on
his
body
moreover
his
funeral
was
even
more
neglected
than
that
of
francois
ii
the
body
was
conducted
from
to
by
brantome
and
a
few
archers
of
the
guard
under
command
of
the
comte
de
solern
this
circumstances
coupled
with
the
supposed
hatred
of
the
mother
to
the
son
may
or
may
not
give
color
to
de
thou
s
supposition
but
it
proves
how
little
affection
catherine
felt
for
any
of
her
children
a
want
of
feeling
which
may
be
explained
by
her
implicit
faith
in
the
predictions
of
judicial
astrology
this
woman
was
unable
to
feel
affection
for
the
instruments
which
were
destined
to
fail
her
henri
iii
was
the
last
king
under
whom
her
reign
of
power
was
to
last
that
was
the
sole
consideration
of
her
heart
and
mind
in
these
days
however
we
can
readily
believe
that
charles
ix
died
a
natural
death
his
excesses
his
manner
of
life
the
sudden
development
of
his
faculties
his
last
spasmodic
attempt
to
recover
the
reins
of
power
his
desire
to
live
the
abuse
of
his
vital
strength
his
final
sufferings
and
last
pleasures
all
prove
to
an
impartial
mind
that
he
died
of
consumption
a
disease
scarcely
studied
at
that
time
and
very
little
understood
the
symptoms
of
which
might
not
unnaturally
lead
charles
ix
to
believe
himself
poisoned
the
real
poison
which
his
mother
gave
him
was
in
the
fatal
counsels
of
the
courtiers
whom
she
placed
about
him
men
who
led
him
to
waste
his
intellectual
as
well
as
his
physical
vigor
thus
bringing
on
a
malady
which
was
purely
fortuitous
and
not
constitutional
under
these
harrowing
circumstances
charles
ix
displayed
a
gloomy
majesty
of
demeanor
which
was
not
unbecoming
to
a
king
the
solemnity
of
his
secret
thoughts
was
reflected
on
his
face
the
olive
tones
of
which
he
inherited
from
his
mother
this
ivory
pallor
so
fine
by
candlelight
so
suited
to
the
expression
of
melancholy
thought
brought
out
vigorously
the
fire
of
the
eyes
which
gazed
from
their
thick
and
heavy
lids
with
the
keen
perception
our
fancy
lends
to
kings
their
color
being
a
cloak
for
dissimulation
those
eyes
were
terrible
especially
from
the
movement
of
their
brows
which
he
could
raise
or
lower
at
will
on
his
bald
high
forehead
his
nose
was
broad
and
long
thick
at
the
end
the
nose
of
a
lion
his
ears
were
large
his
hair
sandy
his
lips
like
those
of
all
consumptives
the
upper
lip
thin
and
sarcastic
the
lower
one
firm
and
full
enough
to
give
an
impression
of
the
noblest
qualities
of
the
heart
the
wrinkles
of
his
brow
the
youth
of
which
was
killed
by
dreadful
cares
inspired
the
strongest
interest
remorse
caused
by
the
uselessness
of
the
accounted
for
some
but
there
were
two
others
on
that
face
which
would
have
been
eloquent
indeed
to
any
student
whose
premature
genius
had
led
him
to
divine
the
principles
of
modern
physiology
these
wrinkles
made
a
deeply
indented
furrow
going
from
each
to
each
corner
of
the
mouth
revealing
the
inward
efforts
of
an
organization
wearied
by
the
toil
of
thought
and
the
violent
excitements
of
the
body
charles
ix
was
if
policy
did
not
stifle
remorse
in
the
breasts
of
those
who
sit
beneath
the
purple
the
looking
at
her
own
work
would
surely
have
felt
it
had
catherine
foreseen
the
effect
of
her
intrigues
upon
her
son
would
she
have
recoiled
from
them
what
a
fearful
spectacle
was
this
a
king
born
vigorous
and
now
so
feeble
a
mind
powerfully
tempered
shaken
by
distrust
a
man
clothed
with
authority
conscious
of
no
support
a
firm
mind
brought
to
the
pass
of
having
lost
all
confidence
in
itself
his
warlike
valor
had
changed
by
degrees
to
ferocity
his
discretion
to
deceit
the
refined
and
delicate
love
of
a
valois
was
now
a
mere
quenchless
thirst
for
pleasure
this
perverted
and
misjudged
great
man
with
all
the
many
facets
of
a
noble
soul
a
king
without
power
a
generous
heart
without
a
friend
dragged
hither
and
thither
by
a
thousand
conflicting
intrigues
presented
the
melancholy
spectacle
of
a
youth
only
years
old
disillusioned
of
life
distrusting
everybody
and
everything
now
resolving
to
risk
all
even
his
life
on
a
last
effort
for
some
time
past
he
had
fully
understood
his
royal
mission
his
power
his
resources
and
the
obstacles
which
his
mother
opposed
to
the
pacification
of
the
kingdom
but
alas
this
light
now
burned
in
a
shattered
lantern
two
men
whom
charles
ix
loved
sufficiently
to
protect
under
circumstances
of
great
danger
jean
chapelain
his
physician
whom
he
saved
from
the
and
ambroise
pare
with
whom
he
went
to
dine
when
pare
s
enemies
were
accusing
him
of
intending
to
poison
the
king
had
arrived
this
evening
in
haste
from
the
provinces
recalled
by
the
both
were
watching
their
master
anxiously
a
few
courtiers
spoke
to
them
in
a
low
voice
but
the
men
of
science
made
guarded
answers
carefully
concealing
the
fatal
verdict
which
was
in
their
minds
every
now
and
then
the
king
would
raise
his
heavy
eyelids
and
give
his
mother
a
furtive
look
which
he
tried
to
conceal
from
those
about
him
suddenly
he
sprang
up
and
stood
before
the
fireplace
monsieur
de
chiverni
he
said
abruptly
why
do
you
keep
the
title
of
chancellor
of
anjou
and
poland
are
you
in
our
service
or
in
that
of
our
brother
i
am
all
yours
sire
replied
chiverni
bowing
low
then
come
to
me
i
intend
to
send
you
to
spain
very
strange
things
are
happening
at
the
court
of
madrid
the
king
looked
at
his
wife
and
flung
himself
back
into
his
chair
strange
things
are
happening
everywhere
said
the
marechal
de
tavannes
one
of
the
friends
of
the
king
s
youth
in
a
low
voice
the
king
rose
again
and
led
this
companion
of
his
youthful
pleasures
apart
into
the
embrasure
of
the
window
at
the
corner
of
the
room
saying
when
they
were
out
of
hearing
i
want
you
remain
here
when
the
others
go
i
shall
know
whether
you
are
for
me
or
against
me
don
t
look
astonished
i
am
about
to
burst
my
bonds
my
mother
is
the
cause
of
all
the
evil
about
me
three
months
hence
i
shall
be
king
indeed
or
dead
silence
if
you
value
your
life
you
will
have
my
secret
you
and
solern
and
villeroy
only
if
it
is
betrayed
it
will
be
by
one
of
you
three
don
t
keep
near
me
go
and
pay
your
court
to
my
mother
tell
her
i
am
dying
and
that
you
don
t
regret
it
for
i
am
only
a
poor
the
king
was
leaning
on
the
shoulder
of
his
old
favorite
and
pretending
to
tell
him
of
his
ailments
in
order
to
mislead
the
inquisitive
eyes
about
him
then
not
wishing
to
make
his
aversion
too
visible
he
went
up
to
his
wife
and
mother
and
talked
with
them
calling
birago
to
their
side
just
then
pinard
one
of
the
secretaries
of
state
glided
like
an
eel
through
the
door
and
along
the
wall
until
he
reached
the
in
whose
ear
he
said
a
few
words
to
which
she
replied
by
an
affirmative
sign
the
king
did
not
ask
his
mother
the
meaning
of
this
conference
but
he
returned
to
his
seat
and
kept
silence
darting
terrible
looks
of
anger
and
suspicion
all
about
him
this
little
circumstance
seemed
of
enormous
consequence
in
the
eyes
of
the
courtiers
and
in
truth
so
marked
an
exercise
of
power
by
the
without
reference
to
the
king
was
like
a
drop
of
water
overflowing
the
cup
queen
elizabeth
and
the
comtesse
de
fiesque
now
retired
but
the
king
paid
no
attention
to
their
movements
though
the
rose
and
attended
her
to
the
door
after
which
the
courtiers
understanding
that
their
presence
was
unwelcome
took
their
leave
by
ten
o
clock
no
one
remained
in
the
hall
but
a
few
intimates
the
two
gondis
tavannes
solern
birago
the
king
and
the
the
king
sat
plunged
in
the
blackest
melancholy
the
silence
was
oppressive
catherine
seemed
embarrassed
she
wished
to
leave
the
room
and
waited
for
the
king
to
escort
her
to
the
door
but
he
still
continued
obstinately
lost
in
thought
at
last
she
rose
to
bid
him
and
charles
ix
was
forced
to
do
likewise
as
she
took
his
arm
and
made
a
few
steps
toward
the
door
she
bent
to
his
ear
and
whispered
monsieur
i
have
important
things
to
say
to
passing
a
mirror
on
her
way
she
glanced
into
it
and
made
a
sign
with
her
eyes
to
the
two
gondis
which
escaped
the
king
s
notice
for
he
was
at
the
moment
exchanging
looks
of
intelligence
with
the
comte
de
solern
and
villeroy
tavannes
was
thoughtful
sire
said
the
latter
coming
out
of
his
reverie
i
think
you
are
royally
ennuyed
don
t
you
ever
amuse
yourself
now
have
you
forgotten
the
times
when
we
used
to
vagabondize
about
the
streets
at
night
ah
those
were
the
good
old
times
said
the
king
with
a
sigh
why
not
bring
them
back
said
birago
glancing
significantly
at
the
gondis
as
he
took
his
leave
yes
i
always
think
of
those
days
with
pleasure
said
albert
de
gondi
duc
de
retz
i
d
like
to
see
you
on
the
roofs
once
more
monsieur
le
duc
remarked
tavannes
damned
italian
cat
i
wish
he
might
break
his
neck
he
added
in
a
whisper
to
the
king
i
don
t
know
which
of
us
two
could
climb
the
quickest
in
these
days
replied
de
gondi
but
one
thing
i
do
know
that
neither
of
us
fears
to
well
sire
will
you
start
upon
a
frolic
in
the
streets
as
you
did
in
the
days
of
your
youth
said
the
other
gondi
master
of
the
wardrobe
the
days
of
his
youth
so
at
years
of
age
the
wretched
king
seemed
no
longer
young
to
any
one
not
even
to
his
flatterers
tavannes
and
his
master
now
reminded
each
other
like
two
of
certain
pranks
they
had
played
in
paris
and
the
evening
s
amusement
was
soon
arranged
the
two
italians
challenged
to
climb
roofs
and
jump
from
one
to
another
across
alleys
and
streets
wagered
that
they
would
follow
the
king
wherever
he
went
they
and
tavannes
went
off
to
change
their
clothes
the
comte
de
solern
left
alone
with
the
king
looked
at
him
in
amazement
though
the
worthy
german
filled
with
compassion
for
the
hapless
position
of
the
king
of
france
was
honor
and
fidelity
itself
he
was
certainly
not
quick
of
perception
charles
surrounded
by
hostile
persons
unable
to
trust
any
one
not
even
his
wife
who
had
been
guilty
of
some
indiscretions
unaware
as
she
was
that
his
mother
and
his
servants
were
his
enemies
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
find
in
monsieur
de
solern
a
faithful
friend
in
whom
he
could
place
entire
confidence
tavannes
and
villeroy
were
trusted
with
only
a
part
of
the
king
s
secrets
the
comte
de
solern
alone
knew
the
whole
of
the
plan
which
he
was
now
about
to
carry
out
this
devoted
friend
was
also
useful
to
his
master
in
possessing
a
body
of
discreet
and
affectionate
followers
who
blindly
obeyed
his
orders
he
commanded
a
detachment
of
the
archers
of
the
guards
and
for
the
last
few
days
he
had
been
sifting
out
the
men
who
were
faithfully
attached
to
the
king
in
order
to
make
a
company
of
tried
men
when
the
need
came
the
king
took
thought
of
everything
why
are
you
surprised
solern
he
said
you
know
very
well
i
need
a
pretext
to
be
out
it
is
true
i
have
madame
de
belleville
but
this
is
better
for
who
knows
whether
my
mother
does
not
hear
of
all
that
goes
on
at
marie
s
monsieur
de
solern
who
was
to
follow
the
king
asked
if
he
might
not
take
a
few
of
his
germans
to
patrol
the
streets
and
charles
consented
about
eleven
o
clock
the
king
who
was
now
very
gay
set
forth
with
his
three
courtiers
namely
tavannes
and
the
two
gondis
i
ll
go
and
take
my
little
marie
by
surprise
said
charles
ix
to
tavannes
as
we
pass
through
the
rue
de
l
that
street
being
on
the
way
to
the
rue
it
would
have
been
strange
indeed
for
the
king
to
pass
the
house
of
his
love
without
stopping
looking
out
for
a
chance
of
mischief
a
belated
burgher
to
frighten
or
a
watchman
to
thrash
the
king
went
along
with
his
nose
in
the
air
watching
all
the
lighted
windows
to
see
what
was
happening
and
striving
to
hear
the
conversations
but
alas
he
found
his
good
city
of
paris
in
a
state
of
deplorable
tranquillity
suddenly
as
he
passed
the
house
of
a
perfumer
named
rene
who
supplied
the
court
the
king
noticing
a
strong
light
from
a
window
in
the
roof
was
seized
by
one
of
those
apparently
hasty
inspirations
which
to
some
minds
suggest
a
previous
intention
this
perfumer
was
strongly
suspected
of
curing
rich
uncles
who
thought
themselves
ill
the
court
laid
at
his
door
the
famous
elixir
of
inheritance
and
even
accused
him
of
poisoning
jeanne
d
albret
mother
of
henri
of
navarre
who
was
buried
in
spite
of
charles
s
positive
order
without
her
head
being
opened
for
the
last
two
months
the
king
had
sought
some
way
of
sending
a
spy
into
rene
s
laboratory
where
as
he
was
well
aware
cosmo
ruggiero
spent
much
time
the
king
intended
if
anything
suspicious
were
discovered
to
proceed
in
the
matter
alone
without
the
assistance
of
the
police
or
law
with
whom
as
he
well
knew
his
mother
would
counteract
him
by
means
of
either
corruption
or
fear
it
is
certain
that
during
the
sixteenth
century
and
the
years
that
preceded
and
followed
it
poisoning
was
brought
to
a
perfection
unknown
to
modern
chemistry
as
history
itself
will
prove
italy
the
cradle
of
modern
science
was
at
this
period
the
inventor
and
mistress
of
these
secrets
many
of
which
are
now
lost
hence
the
reputation
for
that
crime
which
weighed
for
the
two
following
centuries
on
italy
have
so
greatly
abused
it
that
wherever
they
have
introduced
italians
into
their
tales
they
have
almost
always
made
them
play
the
part
of
assassins
and
poisoners
if
italy
then
had
the
traffic
in
subtle
poisons
which
some
historians
attribute
to
her
we
should
remember
her
supremacy
in
the
art
of
toxicology
as
we
do
her
in
all
other
human
knowledge
and
art
in
which
she
took
the
lead
in
europe
the
crimes
of
that
period
were
not
her
crimes
specially
she
served
the
passions
of
the
age
just
as
she
built
magnificent
edifices
commanded
armies
painted
noble
frescos
sang
romances
loved
queens
delighted
kings
devised
ballets
and
fetes
and
ruled
all
policies
the
horrible
art
of
poisoning
reached
to
such
a
pitch
in
florence
that
a
woman
dividing
a
peach
with
a
duke
using
a
golden
with
one
side
of
its
blade
poisoned
ate
one
half
of
the
peach
herself
and
killed
the
duke
with
the
other
half
a
pair
of
perfumed
gloves
were
known
to
have
infiltrated
mortal
illness
through
the
pores
of
the
skin
poison
was
instilled
into
bunches
of
natural
roses
and
the
fragrance
when
inhaled
gave
death
don
john
of
austria
was
poisoned
it
was
said
by
a
pair
of
boots
written
years
tr
charles
ix
had
good
reason
to
be
curious
in
the
matter
we
know
already
the
dark
suspicions
and
beliefs
which
now
prompted
him
to
surprise
the
perfumer
rene
at
his
work
the
old
fountain
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
l
which
has
since
been
rebuilt
offered
every
facility
for
the
royal
vagabonds
to
climb
upon
the
roof
of
a
house
not
far
from
that
of
rene
which
the
king
wished
to
visit
charles
followed
by
his
companions
began
to
ramble
over
the
roofs
to
the
great
terror
of
the
burghers
awakened
by
the
tramp
of
these
false
thieves
who
called
to
them
in
saucy
language
listened
to
their
talk
and
even
pretended
to
force
an
entrance
when
the
italians
saw
the
king
and
tavannes
threading
their
way
among
the
roofs
of
the
house
next
to
that
of
rene
albert
de
gondi
sat
down
declaring
that
he
was
tired
and
his
brother
followed
his
example
so
much
the
better
thought
the
king
glad
to
leave
his
spies
behind
him
tavannes
began
to
laugh
at
the
two
florentines
left
sitting
alone
in
the
midst
of
deep
silence
in
a
place
where
they
had
nought
but
the
skies
above
them
and
the
cats
for
auditors
but
the
brothers
made
use
of
their
position
to
exchange
thoughts
they
would
not
dare
to
utter
on
any
other
spot
in
the
world
thoughts
inspired
by
the
events
of
the
evening
albert
said
the
to
the
marechal
the
king
will
get
the
better
of
the
we
are
doing
a
foolish
thing
for
our
own
interests
to
stay
by
those
of
catherine
if
we
go
over
to
the
king
now
when
he
is
searching
everywhere
for
support
against
her
and
for
able
men
to
serve
him
we
shall
not
be
driven
away
like
wild
beasts
when
the
is
banished
imprisoned
or
you
wouldn
t
get
far
with
such
ideas
charles
replied
the
marechal
gravely
you
d
follow
the
king
into
the
grave
and
he
won
t
live
long
he
is
ruined
by
excesses
cosmo
ruggiero
predicts
his
death
within
a
the
dying
boar
has
often
killed
the
huntsman
said
charles
de
gondi
this
conspiracy
of
the
duc
d
alencon
the
king
of
navarre
and
the
prince
de
conde
with
whom
la
mole
and
coconnas
are
negotiating
is
more
dangerous
than
useful
in
the
first
place
the
king
of
navarre
whom
the
hoped
to
catch
in
the
very
act
distrusts
her
and
declines
to
run
his
head
into
the
noose
he
means
to
profit
by
the
conspiracy
without
taking
any
of
its
risks
besides
the
notion
now
is
to
put
the
crown
on
the
head
of
the
duc
d
alencon
who
has
turned
but
don
t
you
see
that
this
conspiracy
enables
the
to
find
out
what
the
huguenots
can
do
with
the
duc
d
alencon
and
what
the
king
can
do
with
the
huguenots
for
the
king
is
even
now
negotiating
with
them
but
he
ll
be
finely
pilloried
when
catherine
reveals
to
him
the
which
will
neutralize
all
his
ah
exclaimed
charles
de
gondi
by
dint
of
profiting
by
our
advice
she
s
clever
and
stronger
than
we
well
that
s
all
all
right
for
the
duc
d
anjou
who
prefers
to
be
king
of
france
rather
than
king
of
poland
i
am
going
now
to
explain
the
matter
to
when
do
you
start
albert
i
am
ordered
to
accompany
the
king
of
poland
and
i
expect
to
join
him
in
venice
where
the
patricians
have
taken
upon
themselves
to
amuse
and
delay
you
are
prudence
itself
i
swear
to
you
there
is
not
the
slightest
danger
for
either
of
us
in
remaining
at
court
if
there
were
do
you
think
i
would
go
away
i
should
stay
by
the
side
of
our
kind
kind
exclaimed
the
she
is
a
woman
to
drop
all
her
instruments
the
moment
she
finds
them
you
pretend
to
be
a
soldier
and
you
fear
death
every
business
has
its
duties
and
we
have
ours
in
making
our
fortune
by
attaching
ourselves
to
kings
the
source
of
all
temporal
power
which
protects
elevates
and
enriches
families
we
are
forced
to
give
them
as
devoted
a
love
as
that
which
burns
in
the
hearts
of
martyrs
toward
heaven
we
must
suffer
in
their
cause
when
they
sacrifice
us
to
the
interests
of
their
throne
we
may
perish
for
we
die
as
much
for
ourselves
as
for
them
but
our
name
and
our
families
perish
not
you
are
right
as
to
yourself
albert
for
they
have
given
you
the
ancient
title
and
duchy
of
de
now
listen
to
me
replied
his
brother
the
queen
hopes
much
from
the
cleverness
of
the
ruggieri
she
expects
them
to
bring
the
king
once
more
under
her
control
when
charles
refused
to
use
rene
s
perfumes
any
longer
the
wary
woman
knew
at
once
on
whom
his
suspicions
really
rested
but
who
can
tell
the
schemes
that
are
in
his
mind
perhaps
he
is
only
hesitating
as
to
what
fate
he
shall
give
his
mother
he
hates
her
you
know
he
said
a
few
words
about
it
to
his
wife
she
repeated
them
to
madame
de
fiesque
and
madame
de
fiesque
told
the
since
then
the
king
has
kept
away
from
his
the
time
has
come
said
charles
de
gondi
to
do
what
asked
the
marechal
to
lay
hold
of
the
king
s
mind
replied
the
who
if
he
was
not
so
much
in
the
queen
s
confidence
as
his
brother
was
by
no
means
less
charles
i
have
opened
a
great
career
to
you
said
his
brother
gravely
if
you
wish
to
be
a
duke
also
be
as
i
am
the
accomplice
and
cat
of
our
mistress
she
is
the
strongest
here
and
she
will
continue
in
power
madame
de
sauves
is
on
her
side
and
the
king
of
navarre
and
the
duc
d
alencon
are
still
for
madame
de
sauves
catherine
holds
the
pair
in
a
leash
under
charles
and
she
will
hold
them
in
future
under
henri
iii
god
grant
that
henri
may
not
prove
how
so
his
mother
is
doing
too
much
for
hush
what
noise
is
that
i
hear
in
the
rue
cried
the
listen
there
is
some
one
at
rene
s
door
don
t
you
hear
the
footsteps
of
many
men
can
they
have
arrested
the
ruggieri
ah
this
is
prudence
indeed
the
king
has
not
shown
his
usual
impetuosity
but
where
will
they
imprison
them
let
us
go
down
into
the
street
and
the
two
brothers
reached
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
l
autruche
just
as
the
king
was
entering
the
house
of
his
mistress
marie
touchet
by
the
light
of
the
torches
which
the
concierge
carried
they
distinguished
tavannes
and
the
two
ruggieri
hey
tavannes
cried
the
running
after
the
king
s
companion
who
had
turned
and
was
making
his
way
back
to
the
louvre
what
happened
to
you
we
fell
into
a
nest
of
sorcerers
and
arrested
two
compatriots
of
yours
who
may
perhaps
be
able
to
explain
to
the
minds
of
french
gentlemen
how
you
who
are
not
frenchmen
have
managed
to
lay
hands
on
two
of
the
chief
offices
of
the
crown
replied
tavannes
half
jesting
half
in
earnest
but
the
king
inquired
the
who
cared
little
for
tavanne
s
enmity
he
stays
with
his
we
reached
our
present
distinction
through
an
absolute
devotion
to
our
masters
a
noble
course
my
dear
tavannes
which
i
see
that
you
also
have
adopted
replied
albert
de
gondi
the
three
courtiers
walked
on
in
silence
at
the
moment
when
they
parted
on
meeting
their
servants
who
then
escorted
them
two
men
glided
swiftly
along
the
walls
of
the
rue
de
l
autruche
these
men
were
the
king
and
the
comte
de
solern
who
soon
reached
the
banks
of
the
seine
at
a
point
where
a
boat
and
two
rowers
carefully
selected
by
de
solern
awaited
them
in
a
very
few
moments
they
reached
the
other
shore
my
mother
has
not
gone
to
bed
cried
the
king
she
will
see
us
we
chose
a
bad
place
for
the
she
will
think
it
a
duel
replied
solern
and
she
can
not
possibly
distinguish
who
we
are
at
this
well
let
her
see
me
exclaimed
charles
ix
i
am
resolved
now
the
king
and
his
confidant
sprang
ashore
and
walked
quickly
in
the
direction
of
the
when
they
reached
it
the
comte
de
solern
preceding
the
king
met
a
man
who
was
evidently
on
the
watch
and
with
whom
he
exchanged
a
few
words
the
man
then
retired
to
a
distance
presently
two
other
men
who
seemed
to
be
princes
by
the
marks
of
respect
which
the
first
man
paid
to
them
left
the
place
where
they
were
evidently
hiding
behind
the
broken
fence
of
a
field
and
approached
the
king
to
whom
they
bent
the
knee
but
charles
ix
raised
them
before
they
touched
the
ground
saying
no
ceremony
we
are
all
gentlemen
a
venerable
old
man
who
might
have
been
taken
for
the
chancelier
de
l
hopital
had
the
latter
not
died
in
the
preceding
year
now
joined
the
three
gentlemen
all
four
walking
rapidly
so
as
to
reach
a
spot
where
their
conference
could
not
be
overheard
by
their
attendants
the
comte
de
solern
followed
at
a
slight
distance
to
keep
watch
over
the
king
that
faithful
servant
was
filled
with
a
distrust
not
shared
by
charles
a
man
to
whom
life
was
now
a
burden
he
was
the
only
person
on
the
king
s
side
who
witnessed
this
mysterious
conference
which
presently
became
animated
sire
said
one
of
the
the
connetable
de
montmorency
the
closest
friend
of
the
king
your
father
agreed
with
the
marechal
de
in
declaring
that
madame
catherine
ought
to
be
sewn
up
in
a
sack
and
flung
into
the
river
if
that
had
been
done
then
many
worthy
persons
would
still
be
i
have
enough
executions
on
my
conscience
monsieur
replied
the
king
but
sire
said
the
youngest
of
the
four
personages
if
you
merely
banish
her
from
the
depths
of
her
exile
queen
catherine
will
continue
to
stir
up
strife
and
to
find
auxiliaries
we
have
everything
to
fear
from
the
guises
who
for
the
last
nine
years
have
schemed
for
a
vast
catholic
alliance
in
the
secret
of
which
your
majesty
is
not
included
and
it
threatens
your
throne
this
alliance
was
invented
by
spain
which
will
never
renounce
its
project
of
destroying
the
boundary
of
the
pyrenees
sire
calvinism
will
save
france
by
setting
up
a
moral
barrier
between
her
and
a
nation
which
covets
the
empire
of
the
world
if
the
is
exiled
she
will
turn
for
help
to
spain
and
to
the
gentlemen
said
the
king
know
this
if
by
your
help
peace
without
distrust
is
once
established
i
will
take
upon
myself
the
duty
of
making
all
subjects
tremble
it
is
time
indeed
for
royalty
to
assert
itself
my
mother
is
right
in
that
at
any
rate
you
ought
to
know
that
it
is
to
your
interest
was
well
as
mine
for
your
hands
your
fortunes
depend
upon
our
throne
if
religion
is
overthrown
the
hands
you
allow
to
do
it
will
be
laid
next
upon
the
throne
and
then
upon
you
i
no
longer
care
to
fight
ideas
with
weapons
that
can
not
touch
them
let
us
see
now
if
protestantism
will
make
progress
when
left
to
itself
above
all
i
would
like
to
see
with
whom
and
what
the
spirit
of
that
faction
will
wrestle
the
admiral
god
rest
his
soul
was
not
my
enemy
he
swore
to
me
to
restrain
the
revolt
within
spiritual
limits
and
to
leave
the
ruling
of
the
kingdom
to
the
monarch
his
master
with
submissive
subjects
gentlemen
if
the
matter
be
still
within
your
power
set
that
example
now
help
your
sovereign
to
put
down
a
spirit
of
rebellion
which
takes
tranquillity
from
each
and
all
of
us
war
is
depriving
us
of
revenue
it
is
ruining
the
kingdom
i
am
weary
of
these
constant
troubles
so
weary
that
if
it
is
absolutely
necessary
i
will
sacrifice
my
mother
nay
i
will
go
farther
i
will
keep
an
equal
number
of
protestants
and
catholics
about
me
and
i
will
hold
the
axe
of
louis
xi
above
their
heads
to
force
them
to
be
on
good
terms
if
the
messieurs
de
guise
plot
a
holy
alliance
to
attack
our
crown
the
executioner
shall
begin
with
their
heads
i
see
the
miseries
of
my
people
and
i
will
make
short
work
of
the
great
lords
who
care
little
for
consciences
let
them
hold
what
opinions
they
like
what
i
want
in
future
is
submissive
subjects
who
will
work
according
to
my
will
for
the
prosperity
of
the
state
gentlemen
i
give
you
ten
days
to
negotiate
with
your
friends
to
break
off
your
plots
and
to
return
to
me
who
will
be
your
father
if
you
refuse
you
will
see
great
changes
i
shall
use
the
mass
of
the
people
who
will
rise
at
my
voice
against
the
lords
i
will
make
myself
a
king
who
pacificates
his
kingdom
by
striking
down
those
who
are
more
powerful
even
than
you
and
who
dare
defy
him
if
the
troops
fail
me
i
have
my
brother
of
spain
on
whom
i
shall
call
to
defend
our
menaced
thrones
and
if
i
lack
a
minister
to
carry
out
my
will
he
can
lend
me
the
duke
of
but
in
that
case
sire
we
should
have
germans
to
oppose
to
your
spaniards
said
one
of
his
hearers
cousin
replied
charles
coldly
my
wife
s
name
is
elizabeth
of
austria
support
might
fail
you
on
the
german
side
but
for
heaven
s
sake
let
us
fight
if
fight
we
must
alone
without
the
help
of
foreigners
you
are
the
object
of
my
mother
s
hatred
and
you
stand
near
enough
to
me
to
be
my
second
in
the
duel
i
am
about
to
fight
with
her
well
then
listen
to
what
i
now
say
you
seem
to
me
so
worthy
of
confidence
that
i
offer
you
the
post
of
will
not
betray
me
like
the
the
prince
to
whom
charles
ix
had
addressed
himself
struck
his
hand
into
that
of
the
king
exclaiming
brother
this
is
enough
to
make
me
forget
many
wrongs
but
sire
the
head
can
not
march
without
the
tail
and
ours
is
a
long
tail
to
drag
give
me
more
than
ten
days
we
want
at
least
a
month
to
make
our
friends
hear
reason
at
the
end
of
that
time
we
shall
be
a
month
so
be
it
my
only
negotiator
will
be
villeroy
trust
no
one
else
no
matter
what
is
said
to
one
month
echoed
the
other
seigneurs
that
is
gentlemen
we
are
five
said
the
king
five
men
of
honor
if
any
betrayal
takes
place
we
shall
know
on
whom
to
avenge
the
three
strangers
kissed
the
hand
of
charles
ix
and
took
leave
of
him
with
every
mark
of
the
utmost
respect
as
the
king
recrossed
the
seine
four
o
clock
was
ringing
from
the
of
the
louvre
lights
were
on
in
the
s
room
she
had
not
yet
gone
to
bed
my
mother
is
still
on
the
watch
said
charles
to
the
comte
de
solern
she
has
her
forge
as
you
have
yours
remarked
the
german
dear
count
what
do
you
think
of
a
king
who
is
reduced
to
become
a
conspirator
said
charles
bitterly
after
a
pause
i
think
sire
that
if
you
would
allow
me
to
fling
that
woman
into
the
river
as
your
young
cousin
said
france
would
soon
be
at
what
a
parricide
in
addition
to
the
count
cried
the
king
no
no
i
will
exile
her
once
fallen
my
mother
will
no
longer
have
either
servants
or
well
then
sire
replied
the
comte
de
solern
give
me
the
order
to
arrest
her
at
once
and
take
her
out
of
the
kingdom
for
she
will
have
forced
you
to
change
your
come
to
my
forge
said
the
king
no
one
can
overhear
us
there
besides
i
don
t
want
my
mother
to
suspect
the
capture
of
the
ruggieri
if
she
knows
i
am
in
my
she
ll
suppose
nothing
and
we
can
consult
about
the
proper
measures
for
her
as
the
king
entered
a
lower
room
of
the
palace
which
he
used
for
a
workshop
he
called
his
companion
s
attention
to
the
forge
and
his
implements
with
a
laugh
i
don
t
believe
he
said
among
all
the
kings
that
france
will
ever
have
there
ll
be
another
to
take
pleasure
in
such
work
as
that
but
when
i
am
really
king
i
ll
forge
no
swords
they
shall
all
go
back
into
their
sire
said
the
comte
de
solern
the
fatigues
of
tennis
and
hunting
your
toil
at
this
forge
and
if
i
may
say
it
love
are
chariots
which
the
devil
is
offering
you
to
get
the
faster
to
solern
said
the
king
in
a
piteous
tone
if
you
knew
the
fire
they
have
put
into
my
soul
and
body
nothing
can
quench
it
are
you
sure
of
the
men
who
are
guarding
the
ruggieri
as
sure
as
of
very
good
then
during
this
coming
day
i
shall
take
my
own
course
think
of
the
proper
means
of
making
the
arrest
and
i
will
give
you
my
final
orders
by
five
o
clock
at
madame
de
belleville
as
the
first
rays
of
dawn
were
struggling
with
the
lights
of
the
workshop
charles
left
alone
by
the
departure
of
the
comte
de
solern
heard
the
door
of
the
apartment
turn
on
its
hinges
and
saw
his
mother
standing
within
it
in
the
dim
light
like
a
phantom
though
very
nervous
and
impressible
the
king
did
not
quiver
albeit
under
the
circumstances
in
which
he
then
stood
this
apparition
had
a
certain
air
of
mystery
and
horror
monsieur
she
said
you
are
killing
i
am
fulfilling
my
horoscope
he
replied
with
a
bitter
smile
but
you
madame
you
appear
to
be
as
early
as
we
have
both
been
up
all
night
monsieur
but
with
very
different
intentions
while
you
have
been
conferring
with
your
worst
enemies
in
the
open
fields
concealing
your
acts
from
your
mother
assisted
by
tavannes
and
the
gondis
with
whom
you
have
been
scouring
the
town
i
have
been
reading
despatches
which
contained
the
proofs
of
a
terrible
conspiracy
in
which
your
brother
the
duc
d
alencon
your
the
king
of
navarre
the
prince
de
conde
and
half
the
nobles
of
your
kingdom
are
taking
part
their
purpose
is
nothing
less
than
to
take
the
crown
from
your
head
and
seize
your
person
those
gentlemen
have
already
fifty
thousand
good
troops
behind
bah
exclaimed
the
king
incredulously
your
brother
has
turned
huguenot
she
continued
my
brother
gone
over
to
the
huguenots
cried
charles
brandishing
the
piece
of
iron
which
he
held
in
his
hand
yes
the
duc
d
alencon
huguenot
at
heart
will
soon
be
one
before
the
eyes
of
the
world
your
sister
the
queen
of
navarre
has
almost
ceased
to
love
you
she
cares
more
for
the
duc
d
alencon
she
cares
of
bussy
and
she
loves
that
little
la
what
a
heart
exclaimed
the
king
that
little
la
mole
went
on
the
queen
wishes
to
make
himself
a
great
man
by
giving
france
a
king
of
his
own
stripe
he
is
promised
they
say
the
place
of
curse
that
margot
cried
the
king
this
is
what
comes
of
her
marriage
with
a
heretic
or
not
is
of
no
consequence
the
trouble
is
that
in
spite
of
my
advice
you
have
brought
the
head
of
the
younger
branch
too
near
the
throne
by
that
marriage
and
henri
s
purpose
is
now
to
embroil
you
with
the
rest
and
make
you
kill
one
another
the
house
of
bourbon
is
the
enemy
of
the
house
of
valois
remember
that
monsieur
all
younger
branches
should
be
kept
in
a
state
of
poverty
for
they
are
born
conspirators
it
is
sheer
folly
to
give
them
arms
when
they
have
none
or
to
leave
them
in
possession
of
arms
when
they
seize
them
let
every
younger
son
be
made
incapable
of
doing
harm
that
is
the
law
of
crowns
the
sultans
of
asia
follow
it
the
proofs
of
this
conspiracy
are
in
my
room
upstairs
where
i
asked
you
to
follow
me
last
evening
when
you
bade
me
but
instead
of
doing
so
it
seems
you
had
other
plans
i
therefore
waited
for
you
if
we
do
not
take
the
proper
measures
immediately
you
will
meet
the
fate
of
charles
the
simple
within
a
a
month
exclaimed
the
king
thunderstruck
at
the
coincidence
of
that
period
with
the
delay
asked
for
by
the
princes
themselves
in
a
month
we
shall
be
masters
he
added
to
himself
quoting
their
words
madame
he
said
aloud
what
are
your
proofs
they
are
unanswerable
monsieur
they
come
from
my
daughter
marguerite
alarmed
herself
at
the
possibilities
of
such
a
combination
her
love
for
the
throne
of
the
valois
has
proved
stronger
this
time
than
all
her
other
loves
she
asks
as
the
price
of
her
revelations
that
nothing
shall
be
done
to
la
mole
but
the
scoundrel
seems
to
me
a
dangerous
villain
whom
we
had
better
be
rid
of
as
well
as
the
comte
de
coconnas
your
brother
d
alencon
s
right
hand
as
for
the
prince
de
conde
he
consents
to
everything
provided
i
am
thrown
into
the
sea
perhaps
that
is
the
wedding
present
he
gives
me
in
return
for
the
pretty
wife
i
gave
him
all
this
is
a
serious
matter
monsieur
you
talk
of
horoscopes
i
know
of
the
prediction
which
gives
the
throne
of
the
valois
to
the
bourbons
and
if
we
do
not
take
care
it
will
be
fulfilled
do
not
be
angry
with
your
sister
she
has
behaved
well
in
this
affair
my
son
continued
the
queen
after
a
pause
giving
a
tone
of
tenderness
to
her
words
evil
persons
on
the
side
of
the
guises
are
trying
to
sow
dissensions
between
you
and
me
and
yet
we
are
the
only
ones
in
the
kingdom
whose
interests
are
absolutely
identical
you
blame
me
i
know
for
the
you
accuse
me
of
having
forced
you
into
it
catholicism
monsieur
must
be
the
bond
between
france
spain
and
italy
three
countries
which
can
by
skilful
management
secretly
planned
be
united
in
course
of
time
under
the
house
of
valois
do
not
deprive
yourself
of
such
chances
by
loosing
the
cord
which
binds
the
three
kingdoms
in
the
bonds
of
a
common
faith
why
should
not
the
valois
and
the
medici
carry
out
for
their
own
glory
the
scheme
of
charles
the
fifth
whose
head
failed
him
let
us
fling
off
that
race
of
jeanne
la
folle
the
medici
masters
of
florence
and
of
rome
will
force
italy
to
support
your
interests
they
will
guarantee
you
advantages
by
treaties
of
commerce
and
alliance
which
shall
recognize
your
fiefs
in
piedmont
the
milanais
and
naples
where
you
have
rights
these
monsieur
are
the
reasons
of
the
war
to
the
death
which
we
make
against
the
huguenots
why
do
you
force
me
to
repeat
these
things
charlemagne
was
wrong
in
advancing
toward
the
north
france
is
a
body
whose
heart
is
on
the
gulf
of
lyons
and
its
two
arms
over
spain
and
italy
therefore
she
must
rule
the
mediterranean
that
basket
into
which
are
poured
all
the
riches
of
the
orient
now
turned
to
the
profit
of
those
seigneurs
of
venice
in
the
very
teeth
of
philip
ii
if
the
friendship
of
the
medici
and
your
rights
justify
you
in
hoping
for
italy
force
alliances
or
a
possible
inheritance
may
give
you
spain
warn
the
house
of
austria
as
to
this
that
ambitious
house
to
which
the
guelphs
sold
italy
and
which
is
even
now
hankering
after
spain
though
your
wife
is
of
that
house
humble
it
clasp
it
so
closely
that
you
will
smother
it
are
the
enemies
of
your
kingdom
thence
comes
help
to
the
reformers
do
not
listen
to
those
who
find
their
profit
in
causing
us
to
disagree
and
who
torment
your
life
by
making
you
believe
i
am
your
secret
enemy
have
prevented
you
from
having
heirs
why
has
your
mistress
given
you
a
son
and
your
wife
a
daughter
why
have
you
not
three
legitimate
heirs
to
root
out
the
hopes
of
these
seditious
persons
is
it
i
monsieur
who
am
responsible
for
such
failures
if
you
had
an
heir
would
the
duc
d
alencon
be
now
conspiring
as
she
ended
these
words
catherine
fixed
upon
her
son
the
magnetic
glance
of
a
bird
of
prey
upon
its
victim
the
daughter
of
the
medici
became
magnificent
her
real
self
shone
upon
her
face
which
like
that
of
a
gambler
over
the
green
table
glittered
with
vast
cupidities
charles
ix
saw
no
longer
the
mother
of
one
man
but
as
was
said
of
her
the
mother
of
armies
and
of
empires
catherine
had
now
spread
wide
the
wings
of
her
genius
and
boldly
flown
to
the
heights
of
the
medici
and
valois
policy
tracing
once
more
the
mighty
plans
which
terrified
in
earlier
days
her
husband
henri
and
which
transmitted
by
the
genius
of
the
medici
to
richelieu
remain
in
writing
among
the
papers
of
the
house
of
bourbon
but
charles
hearing
the
unusual
persuasions
his
mother
was
using
thought
that
there
must
be
some
necessity
for
them
and
he
began
to
ask
himself
what
could
be
her
motive
he
dropped
his
eyes
he
hesitated
his
distrust
was
not
lessened
by
her
studied
phrases
catherine
was
amazed
at
the
depths
of
suspicion
she
now
beheld
in
her
son
s
heart
well
monsieur
she
said
do
you
not
understand
me
what
are
we
you
and
i
in
comparison
with
the
eternity
of
royal
crowns
do
you
suppose
me
to
have
other
designs
than
those
that
ought
to
actuate
all
royal
persons
who
inhabit
the
sphere
where
empires
are
ruled
madame
i
will
follow
you
to
your
cabinet
we
must
act
act
cried
catherine
let
our
enemies
alone
let
act
take
them
and
law
and
justice
will
deliver
you
from
their
assaults
for
god
s
sake
monsieur
show
them
the
queen
withdrew
the
king
remained
alone
for
a
few
moments
for
he
was
utterly
overwhelmed
on
which
side
is
the
trap
thought
he
which
of
the
two
she
or
they
deceive
me
what
is
my
best
policy
discerne
causam
he
muttered
with
tears
in
his
eyes
life
is
a
burden
to
me
i
prefer
death
natural
or
violent
to
these
perpetual
torments
he
cried
presently
bringing
down
his
hammer
upon
the
anvil
with
such
force
that
the
vaults
of
the
palace
trembled
my
god
he
said
as
he
went
outside
and
looked
up
at
the
sky
thou
for
whose
holy
religion
i
struggle
give
me
the
light
of
thy
countenance
that
i
may
penetrate
the
secrets
of
my
mother
s
heart
while
i
question
the
iii
marie
touchet
the
little
house
of
madame
de
belleville
where
charles
ix
had
deposited
his
prisoners
was
the
last
but
one
in
the
rue
de
l
autruche
on
the
side
of
the
rue
the
street
gate
flanked
by
two
little
brick
pavilions
seemed
very
simple
in
those
days
when
gates
and
their
accessories
were
so
elaborately
treated
it
had
two
pilasters
of
stone
cut
in
facets
and
the
coping
represented
a
reclining
woman
holding
a
cornucopia
the
gate
itself
closed
by
enormous
locks
had
a
wicket
through
which
to
examine
those
who
asked
admittance
in
each
pavilion
lived
a
porter
for
the
king
s
extremely
capricious
pleasure
required
a
porter
by
day
and
by
night
the
house
had
a
little
courtyard
paved
like
those
of
venice
at
this
period
before
carriages
were
invented
ladies
went
about
on
horseback
or
in
litters
so
that
courtyards
could
be
made
magnificent
without
fear
of
injury
from
horses
or
carriages
this
fact
is
always
to
be
remembered
as
an
explanation
of
the
narrowness
of
streets
the
small
size
of
courtyards
and
certain
other
details
of
the
private
dwellings
of
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
the
house
of
one
story
only
above
the
was
capped
by
a
sculptured
frieze
above
which
rose
a
roof
with
four
sides
the
peak
being
flattened
to
form
a
platform
dormer
windows
were
cut
in
this
roof
with
casings
and
pediments
which
the
chisel
of
some
great
artist
had
covered
with
arabesques
and
dentils
each
of
the
three
windows
on
the
main
floor
were
equally
beautiful
in
stone
embroidery
which
the
brick
of
the
walls
showed
off
to
great
advantage
on
the
a
double
portico
very
delicately
decorated
led
to
the
entrance
door
which
was
covered
with
bosses
cut
with
facets
in
the
venetian
manner
a
style
of
decoration
which
was
further
carried
on
round
the
windows
placed
to
right
and
left
of
the
door
a
garden
carefully
laid
out
in
the
fashion
of
the
times
and
filled
with
choice
flowers
occupied
a
space
behind
the
house
equal
to
that
of
the
courtyard
in
front
a
draped
its
walls
in
the
centre
of
a
grass
plot
rose
a
silver
the
were
separated
from
the
grass
by
meandering
paths
which
led
to
an
arbor
of
clipped
yews
at
the
farther
end
of
the
little
garden
the
walls
were
covered
with
a
mosaic
of
variously
colored
pebbles
coarse
in
design
it
is
true
but
pleasing
to
the
eye
from
the
harmony
of
its
tints
with
those
of
the
the
house
had
a
carved
balcony
on
the
garden
side
above
the
door
and
also
on
the
front
toward
the
courtyard
and
around
the
middle
windows
on
both
sides
of
the
house
the
ornamentation
of
the
principal
window
which
projected
some
feet
from
the
wall
rose
to
the
frieze
so
that
it
formed
a
little
pavilion
hung
there
like
a
lantern
the
casings
of
the
other
windows
were
inlaid
on
the
stone
with
precious
marbles
in
spite
of
the
exquisite
taste
displayed
in
the
little
house
there
was
an
air
of
melancholy
about
it
it
was
darkened
by
the
buildings
that
surrounded
it
and
by
the
roofs
of
the
hotel
d
alencon
which
threw
a
heavy
shadow
over
both
court
and
garden
moreover
a
deep
silence
reigned
there
but
this
silence
these
this
solitude
soothed
a
royal
soul
which
could
there
surrender
itself
to
a
single
emotion
as
in
a
cloister
where
men
pray
or
in
some
sheltered
home
wherein
they
love
it
is
easy
now
to
imagine
the
interior
charm
and
choiceness
of
this
haven
the
sole
spot
in
his
kingdom
where
this
dying
valois
could
pour
out
his
soul
reveal
his
sufferings
exercise
his
taste
for
art
and
give
himself
up
to
the
poesy
he
loved
pleasures
denied
him
by
the
cares
of
a
cruel
royalty
here
alone
were
his
great
soul
and
his
high
intrinsic
worth
appreciated
here
he
could
give
himself
up
for
a
few
brief
months
the
last
of
his
life
to
the
joys
of
fatherhood
pleasures
into
which
he
flung
himself
with
the
frenzy
that
a
sense
of
his
coming
and
dreadful
death
impressed
on
all
his
actions
in
the
afternoon
of
the
day
succeeding
the
we
have
just
described
marie
touchet
was
finishing
her
toilet
in
the
oratory
which
was
the
boudoir
of
those
days
she
was
arranging
the
long
curls
of
her
beautiful
black
hair
blending
them
with
the
velvet
of
a
new
coif
and
gazing
intently
into
her
mirror
it
is
nearly
four
o
clock
that
interminable
council
must
surely
be
over
she
thought
to
herself
jacob
has
returned
from
the
louvre
he
says
that
everybody
he
saw
was
excited
about
the
number
of
the
councillors
summoned
and
the
length
of
the
session
what
can
have
happened
is
it
some
misfortune
good
god
surely
knows
how
suspense
wears
out
the
soul
perhaps
he
has
gone
if
he
is
happy
and
amused
it
is
all
right
when
i
see
him
gay
i
forget
all
i
have
she
drew
her
hands
round
her
slender
waist
as
if
to
smooth
some
trifling
wrinkle
in
her
gown
turning
sideways
to
see
if
its
folds
fell
properly
and
as
she
did
so
she
caught
sight
of
the
king
on
the
couch
behind
her
the
carpet
had
so
muffled
the
sound
of
his
steps
that
he
had
slipped
in
softly
without
being
heard
you
frightened
me
she
said
with
a
cry
of
surprise
which
was
quickly
repressed
were
you
thinking
of
me
said
the
king
when
do
i
not
think
of
you
she
answered
sitting
down
beside
him
she
took
off
his
cap
and
cloak
passing
her
hands
through
his
hair
as
though
she
combed
it
with
her
fingers
charles
let
her
do
as
she
pleased
but
made
no
answer
surprised
at
this
marie
knelt
down
to
study
the
pale
face
of
her
royal
master
and
then
saw
the
signs
of
a
dreadful
weariness
and
a
more
consummate
melancholy
than
any
she
had
yet
consoled
she
repressed
her
tears
and
kept
silence
that
she
might
not
irritate
by
mistaken
words
the
sorrow
which
as
yet
she
did
not
understand
in
this
she
did
as
tender
women
do
under
like
circumstances
she
kissed
that
forehead
seamed
with
untimely
wrinkles
and
those
livid
cheeks
trying
to
convey
to
the
soul
the
freshness
of
hers
pouring
her
spirit
into
the
sweet
caresses
which
met
with
no
response
presently
she
raised
her
head
to
the
level
of
the
king
s
clasping
him
softly
in
her
arms
then
she
lay
still
her
face
hidden
on
that
suffering
breast
watching
for
the
opportune
moment
to
question
his
dejected
mind
my
charlot
she
said
at
last
will
you
not
tell
your
poor
distressed
marie
the
troubles
that
cloud
that
precious
brow
and
whiten
those
beautiful
red
lips
except
charlemagne
he
said
in
a
hollow
voice
all
the
kings
of
france
named
charles
have
ended
pooh
she
said
look
at
charles
that
poor
prince
exclaimed
the
king
in
the
flower
of
his
age
he
struck
his
head
against
a
low
door
at
the
chateau
of
amboise
which
he
was
having
decorated
and
died
in
horrible
agony
it
was
his
death
which
gave
the
crown
to
our
charles
vii
reconquered
his
darling
he
died
the
king
lowered
his
voice
of
hunger
for
he
feared
being
poisoned
by
the
dauphin
who
had
already
caused
the
death
of
his
beautiful
agnes
the
father
feared
his
son
the
son
dreads
his
mother
why
drag
up
the
past
she
said
hastily
remembering
the
dreadful
life
of
charles
vi
ah
sweetest
kings
have
no
need
to
go
to
sorcerers
to
discover
their
coming
fate
they
need
only
turn
to
history
i
am
at
this
moment
endeavoring
to
escape
the
fate
of
charles
the
simple
who
was
robbed
of
his
crown
and
died
in
prison
after
seven
years
charles
conquered
the
english
she
cried
triumphantly
no
not
he
but
du
guesclin
he
himself
poisoned
by
charles
de
navarre
dragged
out
a
wretched
well
charles
then
he
married
three
times
to
obtain
an
heir
in
spite
of
the
masculine
beauty
of
the
children
of
philippe
le
bel
the
first
house
of
valois
ended
with
him
and
the
second
is
about
to
end
in
the
same
way
the
queen
has
given
me
only
a
daughter
and
i
shall
die
without
leaving
her
pregnant
for
a
long
minority
would
be
the
greatest
curse
i
could
bequeath
to
the
kingdom
besides
if
i
had
a
son
would
he
live
the
name
of
charles
is
fatal
charlemagne
exhausted
the
luck
of
it
if
i
left
a
son
i
would
tremble
at
the
thought
that
he
would
be
charles
who
is
it
that
wants
to
seize
your
crown
my
brother
d
alencon
conspires
against
it
enemies
are
all
about
monsieur
said
marie
with
a
charming
little
pout
do
tell
me
something
ah
my
little
jewel
my
treasure
don
t
call
me
monsieur
even
in
jest
you
remind
me
of
my
mother
who
stabs
me
incessantly
with
that
title
by
which
she
seems
to
snatch
away
my
crown
she
says
my
son
to
the
duc
d
anjou
i
mean
the
king
of
sire
exclaimed
marie
clasping
her
hands
as
though
she
were
praying
there
is
a
kingdom
where
you
are
worshipped
your
majesty
fills
it
with
his
glory
his
power
and
there
the
word
monsieur
means
my
beloved
she
unclasped
her
hands
and
with
a
pretty
gesture
pointed
to
her
heart
the
words
were
so
to
use
a
word
of
the
times
which
depicted
the
melodies
of
love
that
charles
ix
caught
her
round
the
waist
with
the
nervous
force
that
characterized
him
and
seated
her
on
his
knee
rubbing
his
forehead
gently
against
the
pretty
curls
so
coquettishly
arranged
marie
thought
the
moment
favorable
she
ventured
a
few
kisses
which
charles
allowed
rather
than
accepted
then
she
said
softly
if
my
servants
were
not
mistaken
you
were
out
all
night
in
the
streets
as
in
the
days
when
you
played
the
pranks
of
a
younger
yes
replied
the
king
still
lost
in
his
own
thoughts
did
you
fight
the
watchman
and
frighten
some
of
the
burghers
who
are
the
men
you
brought
here
and
locked
up
they
must
be
very
criminal
as
you
won
t
allow
any
communication
with
them
no
girl
was
ever
locked
in
as
carefully
and
they
have
not
had
a
mouthful
to
eat
since
they
came
the
germans
whom
solern
left
to
guard
them
won
t
let
any
one
go
near
the
room
is
it
a
joke
you
are
playing
or
is
it
something
serious
yes
you
are
right
said
the
king
coming
out
of
his
reverie
last
night
i
did
scour
the
roofs
with
tavannes
and
the
gondis
i
wanted
to
try
my
old
follies
with
the
old
companions
but
my
legs
were
not
what
they
once
were
i
did
not
dare
leap
the
streets
though
we
did
jump
two
alleys
from
one
roof
to
the
next
at
the
second
however
tavannes
and
i
holding
on
to
a
chimney
agreed
that
we
couldn
t
do
it
again
if
either
of
us
had
been
alone
we
couldn
t
have
done
it
i
ll
wager
that
you
sprang
the
king
smiled
i
know
why
you
risk
your
life
in
that
and
why
you
little
witch
you
are
tired
of
ah
sorceress
but
i
am
being
hunted
down
by
sorcery
said
the
king
resuming
his
anxious
look
my
sorcery
is
love
she
replied
smiling
since
the
happy
day
when
you
first
loved
me
have
i
not
always
divined
your
thoughts
and
if
you
will
let
me
speak
the
truth
the
thoughts
which
torture
you
are
not
worthy
of
a
am
i
a
king
he
said
bitterly
can
not
you
be
one
what
did
charles
vii
do
he
listened
to
his
mistress
monseigneur
and
he
reconquered
his
kingdom
invaded
by
the
english
as
yours
is
now
by
the
enemies
of
our
religion
your
last
d
showed
you
the
course
you
have
to
follow
exterminate
you
blamed
the
said
charles
and
now
you
that
is
over
she
said
besides
i
agree
with
madame
catherine
that
it
was
better
to
do
it
yourselves
than
let
the
guises
do
charles
vii
had
only
men
to
fight
i
am
face
to
face
with
ideas
resumed
the
king
we
can
kill
men
but
we
can
t
kill
words
the
emperor
charles
gave
up
the
attempt
his
son
philip
has
spent
his
strength
upon
it
we
shall
all
perish
we
kings
in
that
struggle
on
whom
can
i
rely
to
right
among
the
catholics
i
find
the
guises
who
are
my
enemies
to
left
the
calvinists
who
will
never
forgive
me
the
death
of
my
poor
old
coligny
nor
that
bloody
day
in
august
besides
they
want
to
suppress
the
throne
and
in
front
of
me
what
have
i
my
mother
arrest
her
reign
alone
said
marie
in
a
low
voice
whispering
in
his
ear
i
meant
to
do
so
yesterday
i
no
longer
intend
it
you
speak
of
it
rather
between
the
daughter
of
an
apothecary
and
that
of
a
doctor
there
is
no
great
difference
replied
touchet
always
ready
to
laugh
at
the
false
origin
attributed
to
her
the
king
frowned
marie
don
t
take
such
liberties
catherine
de
medici
is
my
mother
and
you
ought
to
tremble
lest
what
is
it
you
fear
poison
cried
the
king
beside
himself
poor
child
cried
marie
restraining
her
tears
for
the
sight
of
such
strength
united
to
such
weakness
touched
her
deeply
ah
she
continued
you
make
me
hate
madame
catherine
who
has
been
so
good
to
me
her
kindness
now
seems
perfidy
why
is
she
so
kind
to
me
and
bad
to
you
during
my
stay
in
dauphine
i
heard
many
things
about
the
beginning
of
your
reign
which
you
concealed
from
me
it
seems
to
me
that
the
queen
your
mother
is
the
real
cause
of
all
your
in
what
way
cried
the
king
deeply
interested
women
whose
souls
and
whose
intentions
are
pure
use
virtue
wherewith
to
rule
the
men
they
love
but
women
who
do
not
seek
good
rule
men
through
their
evil
instincts
now
the
queen
made
vices
out
of
certain
of
your
noblest
qualities
and
she
taught
you
to
believe
that
your
worst
inclinations
were
virtues
was
that
the
part
of
a
mother
be
a
tyrant
like
louis
xi
inspire
terror
imitate
philip
ii
banish
the
italians
drive
out
the
guises
confiscate
the
lands
of
the
calvinists
out
of
this
solitude
you
will
rise
a
king
you
will
save
the
throne
the
moment
is
propitious
your
brother
is
in
we
are
two
children
at
statecraft
said
charles
bitterly
we
know
nothing
except
how
to
love
alas
my
treasure
yesterday
i
too
thought
all
these
things
i
dreamed
of
accomplishing
great
deeds
bah
my
mother
blew
down
my
house
of
cards
from
a
distance
we
see
great
questions
outlined
like
the
summits
of
mountains
and
it
is
easy
to
say
i
ll
make
an
end
of
calvinism
i
ll
bring
those
guises
to
task
i
ll
separate
from
the
court
of
rome
i
ll
rely
upon
my
people
upon
the
burghers
ah
yes
from
afar
it
all
seems
simple
enough
but
try
to
climb
those
mountains
and
the
higher
you
go
the
more
the
difficulties
appear
calvinism
in
itself
is
the
last
thing
the
leaders
of
that
party
care
for
and
the
guises
those
rabid
catholics
would
be
sorry
indeed
to
see
the
calvinists
put
down
each
side
considers
its
own
interests
exclusively
and
religious
opinions
are
but
a
cloak
for
insatiable
ambition
the
party
of
charles
ix
is
the
feeblest
of
all
that
of
the
king
of
navarre
that
of
the
king
of
poland
that
of
the
duc
d
alencon
that
of
the
condes
that
of
the
guises
that
of
my
mother
are
all
intriguing
one
against
another
but
they
take
no
account
of
me
not
even
in
my
own
council
my
mother
in
the
midst
of
so
many
contending
elements
is
nevertheless
the
strongest
among
them
she
has
just
proved
to
me
the
inanity
of
my
plans
we
are
surrounded
by
rebellious
subjects
who
defy
the
law
the
axe
of
louis
xi
of
which
you
speak
is
lacking
to
us
parliament
would
not
condemn
the
guises
nor
the
king
of
navarre
nor
the
condes
nor
my
brother
no
the
courage
to
assassinate
is
needed
the
throne
will
be
forced
to
strike
down
those
insolent
men
who
suppress
both
law
and
justice
but
where
can
we
find
the
faithful
arm
the
council
i
held
this
morning
has
disgusted
me
with
everything
treason
everywhere
contending
interests
all
about
me
i
am
tired
with
the
burden
of
my
crown
i
only
want
to
die
in
he
dropped
into
a
sort
of
gloomy
somnolence
disgusted
with
everything
repeated
marie
touchet
sadly
but
she
did
not
disturb
the
black
torpor
of
her
lover
charles
was
the
victim
of
a
complete
prostration
of
mind
and
body
produced
by
three
things
the
exhaustion
of
all
his
faculties
aggravated
by
the
disheartenment
of
realizing
the
extent
of
an
evil
the
recognized
impossibility
of
surmounting
his
weakness
and
the
aspect
of
difficulties
so
great
that
genius
itself
would
dread
them
the
king
s
depression
was
in
proportion
to
the
courage
and
the
loftiness
of
ideas
to
which
he
had
risen
during
the
last
few
months
in
addition
to
this
an
attack
of
nervous
melancholy
caused
by
his
malady
had
seized
him
as
he
left
the
protracted
council
which
had
taken
place
in
his
private
cabinet
marie
saw
that
he
was
in
one
of
those
crises
when
the
least
word
even
of
love
would
be
importunate
and
painful
so
she
remained
kneeling
quietly
beside
him
her
head
on
his
knee
the
king
s
hand
buried
in
her
hair
and
he
himself
motionless
without
a
word
without
a
sigh
as
still
as
marie
herself
charles
ix
in
the
lethargy
of
impotence
marie
in
the
stupor
of
despair
which
comes
to
a
loving
woman
when
she
perceives
the
boundaries
at
which
love
ends
the
lovers
thus
remained
in
the
deepest
silence
during
one
of
those
terrible
hours
when
all
reflection
wounds
when
the
clouds
of
an
inward
tempest
veil
even
the
memory
of
happiness
marie
believed
that
she
herself
was
partly
the
cause
of
this
frightful
dejection
she
asked
herself
not
without
horror
if
the
excessive
joys
and
the
violent
love
which
she
had
never
yet
found
strength
to
resist
did
not
contribute
to
weaken
the
mind
and
body
of
the
king
as
she
raised
her
eyes
bathed
in
tears
toward
her
lover
she
saw
the
slow
tears
rolling
down
his
pallid
cheeks
this
mark
of
the
sympathy
that
united
them
so
moved
the
king
that
he
rushed
from
his
depression
like
a
spurred
horse
he
took
marie
in
his
arms
and
placed
her
on
the
sofa
i
will
no
longer
be
a
king
he
cried
i
will
be
your
lover
your
lover
only
wholly
given
up
to
that
happiness
i
will
die
happy
and
not
consumed
by
the
cares
and
miseries
of
a
the
tone
of
these
words
the
fire
that
shone
in
the
eyes
of
the
king
gave
marie
a
terrible
shock
instead
of
happiness
she
blamed
her
love
as
an
accomplice
in
the
malady
of
which
the
king
was
dying
meanwhile
you
forget
your
prisoners
she
said
rising
abruptly
hey
what
care
i
for
them
i
give
them
leave
to
kill
what
are
they
murderers
oh
don
t
be
frightened
little
one
we
hold
them
fast
don
t
think
of
them
but
of
me
do
you
love
me
sire
she
cried
sire
he
repeated
sparks
darting
from
his
eyes
so
violent
was
the
rush
of
his
anger
at
the
untimely
respect
of
his
mistress
you
are
in
league
with
my
o
god
cried
marie
looking
at
the
picture
above
her
and
turning
toward
it
to
say
her
prayer
grant
that
he
comprehend
me
ah
said
the
king
suspiciously
you
have
some
wrong
to
me
upon
your
conscience
then
looking
at
her
from
between
his
arms
he
plunged
his
eyes
into
hers
i
have
heard
some
talk
of
the
mad
passion
of
a
certain
entragues
he
went
on
wildly
ever
since
their
grandfather
the
soldier
balzac
married
a
viscontessa
at
milan
that
family
hold
their
heads
too
marie
looked
at
the
king
with
so
proud
an
air
that
he
was
ashamed
at
that
instant
the
cries
of
little
charles
de
valois
who
had
just
awakened
were
heard
in
the
next
room
marie
ran
to
the
door
come
in
bourguignonne
she
said
taking
the
child
from
its
nurse
and
carrying
it
to
the
king
you
are
more
of
a
child
than
he
she
cried
half
angry
half
appeased
he
is
beautiful
said
charles
taking
his
son
in
his
arms
i
alone
know
how
like
he
is
to
you
said
marie
already
he
has
your
smile
and
your
so
tiny
as
that
said
the
king
laughing
at
her
oh
i
know
men
don
t
believe
such
things
but
watch
him
my
charlot
play
with
him
look
there
see
am
i
not
right
true
exclaimed
the
king
astonished
by
a
motion
of
the
child
which
seemed
the
very
miniature
of
a
gesture
of
his
own
ah
the
pretty
flower
cried
the
mother
never
shall
he
leave
us
will
never
cause
me
the
king
frolicked
with
his
son
he
tossed
him
in
his
arms
and
kissed
him
passionately
talking
the
foolish
unmeaning
talk
the
pretty
baby
language
invented
by
nurses
and
mothers
his
voice
grew
at
last
his
forehead
cleared
joy
returned
to
his
saddened
face
and
then
as
marie
saw
that
he
had
forgotten
his
troubles
she
laid
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
and
whispered
in
his
ear
won
t
you
tell
me
charlot
why
you
have
made
me
keep
murderers
in
my
house
who
are
these
men
and
what
do
you
mean
to
do
with
them
in
short
i
want
to
know
what
you
were
doing
on
the
roofs
i
hope
there
was
no
woman
in
the
business
then
you
love
me
as
much
as
ever
cried
the
king
meeting
the
clear
interrogatory
glance
that
women
know
so
well
how
to
cast
upon
occasion
you
doubted
she
replied
as
a
tear
shone
on
her
beautiful
eyelashes
there
are
women
in
my
adventure
said
the
king
but
they
are
sorceresses
how
far
had
i
told
you
you
were
on
the
roofs
near
by
what
street
was
it
rue
sweetest
said
the
king
who
seemed
to
have
recovered
himself
collecting
this
thoughts
he
began
to
explain
to
his
mistress
what
had
happened
as
if
to
prepare
her
for
a
scene
that
was
presently
to
take
place
in
her
presence
as
i
was
passing
through
the
street
last
night
on
a
frolic
he
said
i
chanced
to
see
a
bright
light
from
the
dormer
window
of
the
house
occupied
by
rene
my
mother
s
glover
and
perfumer
and
once
yours
i
have
strong
doubts
about
that
man
and
what
goes
on
in
his
house
if
i
am
poisoned
the
drug
will
come
from
i
shall
dismiss
him
ah
so
you
kept
him
after
i
had
given
him
up
cried
the
king
i
thought
my
life
was
safe
with
you
he
added
gloomily
but
no
doubt
death
is
following
me
even
but
my
dearest
i
have
only
just
returned
from
dauphine
with
our
dauphin
she
said
smiling
and
rene
has
supplied
me
with
nothing
since
the
death
of
the
queen
of
navarre
go
on
you
climbed
to
the
roof
of
rene
s
house
iv
the
king
s
tale
yes
returned
the
king
in
a
second
i
was
there
followed
by
tavannes
and
then
we
clambered
to
a
spot
where
i
could
see
without
being
seen
the
interior
of
that
devil
s
kitchen
in
which
i
beheld
extraordinary
things
which
inspired
me
to
take
certain
measures
did
you
ever
notice
the
end
of
the
roof
of
that
cursed
perfumer
the
windows
toward
the
street
are
always
closed
and
dark
except
the
last
from
which
can
be
seen
the
hotel
de
soissons
and
the
observatory
which
my
mother
built
for
that
astrologer
cosmo
ruggiero
under
the
roof
are
and
a
gallery
which
have
no
windows
except
on
the
courtyard
so
that
in
order
to
see
what
was
going
on
within
it
was
necessary
to
go
where
no
man
before
ever
dreamed
of
climbing
along
the
coping
of
a
high
wall
which
adjoins
the
roof
of
rene
s
house
the
men
who
set
up
in
that
house
the
furnaces
by
which
they
distil
death
reckoned
on
the
cowardice
of
parisians
to
save
them
from
being
overlooked
but
they
little
thought
of
charles
de
valois
i
crept
along
the
coping
until
i
came
to
a
window
against
the
casing
of
which
i
was
able
to
stand
up
straight
with
my
arm
round
a
carved
monkey
which
ornamented
what
did
you
see
dear
heart
said
marie
trembling
a
den
where
works
of
darkness
were
being
done
replied
the
king
the
first
object
on
which
my
eyes
lighted
was
a
tall
old
man
seated
in
a
chair
with
a
magnificent
white
beard
like
that
of
old
l
hopital
and
dressed
like
him
in
a
black
velvet
robe
on
his
broad
forehead
furrowed
deep
with
wrinkles
on
his
crown
of
white
hair
on
his
calm
attentive
face
pale
with
toil
and
vigils
fell
the
concentrated
rays
of
a
lamp
from
which
shone
a
vivid
light
his
attention
was
divided
between
an
old
manuscript
the
parchment
of
which
must
have
been
centuries
old
and
two
lighted
furnaces
on
which
heretical
compounds
were
cooking
neither
the
floor
nor
the
ceiling
of
the
laboratory
could
be
seen
because
of
the
myriads
of
hanging
skeletons
bodies
of
animals
dried
plants
minerals
and
articles
of
all
kinds
that
masked
the
walls
while
on
the
floor
were
books
instruments
for
distilling
chests
filled
with
utensils
for
magic
and
astrology
in
one
place
i
saw
horoscopes
and
nativities
phials
under
spells
and
possibly
poisons
tavannes
and
i
were
fascinated
i
do
assure
you
by
the
sight
of
this
devil
only
to
see
it
puts
one
under
a
spell
and
if
i
had
not
been
king
of
france
i
might
have
been
awed
by
it
you
can
tremble
for
both
of
us
i
whispered
to
tavannes
but
tavannes
eyes
were
already
caught
by
the
most
mysterious
feature
of
the
scene
on
a
couch
near
the
old
man
lay
a
girl
of
strangest
beauty
slender
and
long
like
a
snake
white
as
ermine
livid
as
death
motionless
as
a
statue
perhaps
it
was
a
woman
just
taken
from
her
grave
on
whom
they
were
trying
experiments
for
she
seemed
to
wear
a
shroud
her
eyes
were
fixed
and
i
could
not
see
that
she
breathed
the
old
fellow
paid
no
attention
to
her
i
looked
at
him
so
intently
that
after
a
while
his
soul
seemed
to
pass
into
mine
by
dint
of
studying
him
i
ended
by
admiring
the
glance
of
his
eye
so
keen
so
profound
so
bold
in
spite
of
the
chilling
power
of
age
i
admired
his
mouth
mobile
with
thoughts
emanating
from
a
desire
which
seemed
to
be
the
solitary
desire
of
his
soul
and
was
stamped
upon
every
line
of
the
face
all
things
in
that
man
expressed
a
hope
which
nothing
discouraged
and
nothing
could
check
his
attitude
a
quivering
immovability
those
outlines
so
free
carved
by
a
single
passion
as
by
the
chisel
of
a
sculptor
that
idea
concentrated
on
some
experiment
criminal
or
scientific
that
seeking
mind
in
quest
of
nature
thwarted
by
her
bending
but
never
broken
under
the
weight
of
its
own
audacity
which
it
would
not
renounce
threatening
creation
with
the
fire
it
derived
from
it
ah
all
that
held
me
in
a
spell
for
the
time
being
i
saw
before
me
an
old
man
who
was
more
of
a
king
than
i
for
his
glance
embraced
the
world
and
mastered
it
i
will
forge
swords
no
longer
i
will
soar
above
the
abysses
of
existence
like
that
man
for
his
science
methinks
is
true
royalty
yes
i
believe
in
occult
you
the
eldest
son
the
defender
of
the
holy
catholic
apostolic
and
roman
church
said
marie
what
happened
to
you
go
on
go
on
i
will
fear
for
you
and
you
will
have
courage
for
looking
at
a
clock
the
old
man
rose
continued
the
king
he
went
out
i
don
t
know
where
but
i
heard
the
window
on
the
side
toward
the
rue
open
soon
a
brilliant
light
gleamed
out
upon
the
darkness
then
i
saw
in
the
observatory
of
the
hotel
de
soissons
another
light
replying
to
that
of
the
old
man
and
by
it
i
beheld
the
figure
of
cosmo
ruggiero
on
the
tower
see
they
communicate
i
said
to
tavannes
who
from
that
moment
thought
the
matter
frightfully
suspicious
and
agreed
with
me
that
we
ought
to
seize
the
two
men
and
search
incontinently
their
accursed
workshop
but
before
proceeding
to
do
so
we
wanted
to
see
what
was
going
to
happen
after
about
fifteen
minutes
the
door
opened
and
cosmo
ruggiero
my
mother
s
counsellor
the
bottomless
pit
which
holds
the
secrets
of
the
court
he
from
whom
all
women
ask
help
against
their
husbands
and
lovers
and
all
the
men
ask
help
against
their
unfaithful
wives
and
mistresses
he
who
traffics
on
the
future
as
on
the
past
receiving
pay
with
both
hands
who
sells
horoscopes
and
is
supposed
to
know
all
things
that
came
in
saying
to
the
old
man
to
you
with
him
he
brought
a
hideous
old
woman
toothless
humpbacked
twisted
bent
like
a
chinese
image
only
worse
she
was
wrinkled
as
a
withered
apple
her
skin
was
her
chin
bit
her
nose
her
mouth
was
a
mere
line
scarcely
visible
her
eyes
were
like
the
black
spots
on
a
dice
her
forehead
emitted
bitterness
her
hair
escaped
in
straggling
gray
locks
from
a
dirty
coif
she
walked
with
a
crutch
she
smelt
of
heresy
and
witchcraft
the
sight
of
her
actually
frightened
us
tavannes
and
me
we
didn
t
think
her
a
natural
woman
god
never
made
a
woman
so
fearful
as
that
she
sat
down
on
a
stool
near
the
pretty
snake
with
whom
tavannes
was
in
love
the
two
brothers
paid
no
attention
to
the
old
woman
nor
to
the
young
woman
who
together
made
a
horrible
couple
on
the
one
side
life
in
death
on
the
other
death
in
life
ah
my
sweet
poet
cried
marie
kissing
the
king
cosmo
replied
the
old
alchemist
and
they
both
looked
into
the
furnace
what
strength
has
the
moon
asked
the
elder
but
replied
my
mother
s
astrologer
the
september
tides
are
not
yet
over
we
can
learn
nothing
while
that
disorder
what
says
the
east
it
discloses
in
the
air
a
creative
force
which
returns
to
earth
all
that
earth
takes
from
it
the
conclusion
is
that
all
things
here
below
are
the
product
of
a
slow
transformation
but
that
all
diversities
are
the
forms
of
one
and
the
same
that
is
what
my
predecessor
thought
replied
lorenzo
this
morning
bernard
palissy
told
me
that
metals
were
the
result
of
compression
and
that
fire
which
divides
all
also
unites
all
fire
has
the
power
to
compress
as
well
as
to
separate
that
man
has
though
i
was
placed
where
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
see
me
cosmo
said
lifting
the
hand
of
the
dead
girl
some
one
is
near
us
who
is
it
the
king
she
answered
i
at
once
showed
myself
and
rapped
on
the
window
ruggiero
opened
it
and
i
sprang
into
that
hellish
kitchen
followed
by
tavannes
yes
the
king
i
said
to
the
two
florentines
who
seemed
terrified
in
spite
of
your
furnaces
and
your
books
your
sciences
and
your
sorceries
you
did
not
foresee
my
visit
i
am
very
glad
to
meet
the
famous
lorenzo
ruggiero
of
whom
my
mother
speaks
mysteriously
i
said
addressing
the
old
man
who
rose
and
bowed
you
are
in
this
kingdom
without
my
consent
my
good
man
for
whom
are
you
working
here
you
whose
ancestors
from
father
to
son
have
been
devoted
in
heart
to
the
house
of
medici
listen
to
me
you
dive
into
so
many
purses
that
by
this
time
if
you
are
grasping
men
you
have
piled
up
gold
you
are
too
shrewd
and
cautious
to
cast
yourselves
imprudently
into
criminal
actions
but
nevertheless
you
are
not
here
in
this
kitchen
without
a
purpose
yes
you
have
some
secret
scheme
you
who
are
satisfied
neither
by
gold
nor
power
whom
do
you
serve
god
or
the
devil
what
are
you
concocting
here
i
choose
to
know
the
whole
truth
i
am
a
man
who
can
hear
it
and
keep
silence
about
your
enterprise
however
blamable
it
maybe
therefore
you
will
tell
me
all
without
reserve
if
you
deceive
me
you
will
be
treated
severely
pagans
or
christians
calvinists
or
mohammedans
you
have
my
royal
word
that
you
shall
leave
the
kingdom
in
safety
if
you
have
any
misdemeanors
to
relate
i
shall
leave
you
for
the
rest
of
the
night
and
the
forenoon
of
to
examine
your
thoughts
for
you
are
now
my
prisoners
and
you
will
at
once
follow
me
to
a
place
where
you
will
be
guarded
before
obeying
me
the
two
italians
consulted
each
other
by
a
subtle
glance
then
lorenzo
ruggiero
said
i
might
be
assured
that
no
torture
could
wring
their
secrets
from
them
that
in
spite
of
their
apparent
feebleness
neither
pain
nor
human
feelings
had
any
power
of
them
confidence
alone
could
make
their
mouth
say
what
their
mind
contained
i
must
not
he
said
be
surprised
if
they
treated
as
equals
with
a
king
who
recognized
god
only
as
above
him
for
their
thoughts
came
from
god
alone
they
therefore
claimed
from
me
as
much
confidence
and
trust
as
they
should
give
to
me
but
before
engaging
themselves
to
answer
me
without
reserve
they
must
request
me
to
put
my
left
hand
into
that
of
the
young
girl
lying
there
and
my
right
into
that
of
the
old
woman
not
wishing
them
to
think
i
was
afraid
of
their
sorcery
i
held
out
my
hands
lorenzo
took
the
right
cosmo
the
left
and
each
placed
a
hand
in
that
of
each
woman
so
that
i
was
like
jesus
christ
between
the
two
thieves
during
the
time
that
the
two
witches
were
examining
my
hands
cosmo
held
a
mirror
before
me
and
asked
me
to
look
into
it
his
brother
meanwhile
was
talking
with
the
two
women
in
a
language
unknown
to
me
neither
tavannes
nor
i
could
catch
the
meaning
of
a
single
sentence
before
bringing
the
men
here
we
put
seals
on
all
the
outlets
of
the
laboratory
which
tavannes
undertook
to
guard
until
such
time
as
by
my
express
orders
bernard
palissy
and
chapelain
my
physician
could
be
brought
there
to
examine
thoroughly
the
drugs
the
place
contained
and
which
were
evidently
made
there
in
order
to
keep
the
ruggieri
ignorant
of
this
search
and
to
prevent
them
from
communicating
with
a
single
soul
outside
i
put
the
two
devils
in
your
lower
rooms
in
charge
of
solern
s
germans
who
are
better
than
the
walls
of
a
jail
rene
the
perfumer
is
kept
under
guard
in
his
own
house
by
solern
s
equerry
and
so
are
the
two
witches
now
my
sweetest
inasmuch
as
i
hold
the
keys
of
the
whole
cabal
the
kings
of
thune
the
chiefs
of
sorcery
the
gypsy
the
masters
of
the
future
the
heirs
of
all
past
soothsayers
i
intend
by
their
means
to
read
to
know
your
heart
and
together
we
will
find
out
what
is
to
happen
to
i
shall
be
glad
if
they
can
lay
my
heart
bare
before
you
said
marie
without
the
slightest
fear
i
know
why
sorcerers
don
t
frighten
you
because
you
are
a
witch
will
you
have
a
peach
she
said
offering
him
some
delicious
fruit
on
a
gold
plate
see
these
grapes
these
pears
i
went
to
vincennes
myself
and
gathered
them
for
yes
i
ll
eat
them
there
is
no
poison
there
except
a
philter
from
your
you
ought
to
eat
a
great
deal
of
fruit
charles
it
would
cool
your
blood
which
you
heat
by
such
must
i
love
you
less
perhaps
so
she
said
if
the
things
you
love
injure
you
and
i
have
feared
it
i
shall
find
strength
in
my
heart
to
refuse
them
i
adore
charles
more
than
i
love
the
king
i
want
the
man
to
live
released
from
the
tortures
that
make
him
royalty
has
ruined
yes
she
replied
if
you
were
only
a
poor
prince
like
your
of
navarre
without
a
penny
possessing
only
a
miserable
little
kingdom
in
spain
where
he
never
sets
his
foot
and
bearn
in
france
which
doesn
t
give
him
revenue
enough
to
feed
him
i
should
be
happy
much
happier
than
if
i
were
really
queen
of
but
you
are
more
than
the
queen
of
france
she
has
king
charles
for
the
sake
of
the
kingdom
only
royal
marriages
are
only
marie
smiled
and
made
a
pretty
little
grimace
as
she
said
yes
yes
i
know
that
sire
and
my
sonnet
have
you
written
it
dearest
verses
are
as
difficult
to
write
as
treaties
of
peace
but
you
shall
have
them
soon
ah
me
life
is
so
easy
here
i
wish
i
might
never
leave
you
however
we
must
send
for
those
italians
and
question
them
i
thought
one
ruggiero
in
the
kingdom
was
one
too
many
but
it
seems
there
are
two
now
listen
my
precious
you
don
t
lack
sense
you
would
make
an
excellent
lieutenant
of
police
for
you
can
penetrate
things
but
sire
we
women
suppose
all
we
fear
and
we
turn
what
is
probable
into
truths
that
is
the
whole
of
our
art
in
a
well
help
me
to
sound
these
men
just
now
all
my
plans
depend
on
the
result
of
their
examination
are
they
innocent
are
they
guilty
my
mother
is
behind
i
hear
jacob
s
voice
in
the
next
room
said
marie
jacob
was
the
favorite
valet
of
the
king
and
the
one
who
accompanied
him
on
all
his
private
excursions
he
now
came
to
ask
if
it
was
the
king
s
good
pleasure
to
speak
to
the
two
prisoners
the
king
made
a
sign
in
the
affirmative
and
the
mistress
of
the
house
gave
her
orders
jacob
she
said
clear
the
house
of
everybody
except
the
nurse
and
monsieur
le
dauphin
d
auvergne
who
may
remain
as
for
you
stay
in
the
lower
hall
but
first
close
the
windows
draw
the
curtains
of
the
salon
and
light
the
the
king
s
impatience
was
so
great
that
while
these
preparations
were
being
made
he
sat
down
upon
a
raised
seat
at
the
corner
of
a
lofty
fireplace
of
white
marble
in
which
a
bright
fire
was
blazing
placing
his
pretty
mistress
by
his
side
his
portrait
framed
in
velvet
was
over
the
mantle
in
place
of
a
mirror
charles
ix
rested
his
elbow
on
the
arm
of
the
seat
as
if
to
watch
the
two
florentines
the
better
under
cover
of
his
hand
the
shutters
closed
and
the
curtains
drawn
jacob
lighted
the
wax
tapers
in
a
tall
candelabrum
of
chiselled
silver
which
he
placed
on
the
table
where
the
florentines
were
to
stand
an
object
by
the
bye
which
they
would
readily
recognize
as
the
work
of
their
compatriot
benvenuto
cellini
the
richness
of
the
room
decorated
in
the
taste
of
charles
now
shone
forth
the
of
the
tapestries
showed
to
better
advantage
than
by
daylight
the
various
articles
of
furniture
delicately
made
or
carved
reflected
in
their
ebony
panels
the
glow
of
the
fire
and
the
sparkle
of
the
lights
gilding
soberly
applied
shone
here
and
there
like
eyes
brightening
the
brown
color
which
prevailed
in
this
nest
of
love
jacob
presently
gave
two
knocks
and
receiving
permission
ushered
in
the
italians
marie
touchet
was
instantly
affected
by
the
grandeur
of
lorenzo
s
presence
which
struck
all
those
who
met
him
great
and
small
alike
the
silvery
whiteness
of
the
old
man
s
beard
was
heightened
by
a
robe
of
black
velvet
his
brow
was
like
a
marble
dome
his
austere
face
illumined
by
two
black
eyes
which
cast
a
pointed
flame
conveyed
an
impression
of
genius
issuing
from
solitude
and
all
the
more
effective
because
its
power
had
not
been
dulled
by
contact
with
men
it
was
like
the
steel
of
a
blade
that
had
never
been
fleshed
as
for
cosmo
ruggiero
he
wore
the
dress
of
a
courtier
of
the
time
marie
made
a
sign
to
the
king
to
assure
him
that
he
had
not
exaggerated
his
description
and
to
thank
him
for
having
shown
her
these
extraordinary
men
i
would
like
to
have
seen
the
sorceresses
too
she
whispered
in
his
ear
the
alchemists
again
absorbed
in
thought
charles
ix
made
her
no
answer
he
was
idly
flicking
crumbs
of
bread
from
his
doublet
and
breeches
your
science
can
not
change
the
heavens
or
make
the
sun
to
shine
messieurs
he
said
at
last
pointing
to
the
curtains
which
the
gray
atmosphere
of
paris
darkened
our
science
can
make
the
skies
what
we
like
sire
replied
lorenzo
ruggiero
the
weather
is
always
fine
for
those
who
work
in
a
laboratory
by
the
light
of
a
that
is
true
said
the
king
well
father
he
added
using
an
expression
familiar
to
him
when
addressing
old
men
explain
to
us
clearly
the
object
of
your
what
will
guarantee
our
safety
the
word
of
a
king
replied
charles
whose
curiosity
was
keenly
excited
by
the
question
lorenzo
ruggiero
seemed
to
hesitate
and
charles
ix
cried
out
what
hinders
you
we
are
here
but
is
the
king
of
france
here
asked
lorenzo
charles
reflected
an
instant
and
then
answered
the
imposing
old
man
then
took
a
chair
and
seated
himself
cosmo
astonished
at
this
boldness
dared
not
imitate
it
charles
ix
remarked
with
cutting
sarcasm
the
king
is
not
here
monsieur
but
a
lady
is
whose
permission
it
was
your
duty
to
he
whom
you
see
before
you
madame
said
the
old
man
is
as
far
above
kings
as
kings
are
above
their
subjects
you
will
think
me
courteous
when
you
know
my
hearing
these
audacious
words
with
italian
emphasis
charles
and
marie
looked
at
each
other
and
also
at
cosmo
who
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
his
brother
seemed
to
be
asking
himself
how
does
he
intend
to
get
us
out
of
the
danger
in
which
we
are
in
fact
there
was
but
one
person
present
who
could
understand
the
boldness
and
the
art
of
lorenzo
ruggiero
s
first
step
and
that
person
was
neither
the
king
nor
his
young
mistress
on
whom
that
great
seer
had
already
flung
the
spell
of
his
audacity
it
was
cosmo
ruggiero
his
wily
brother
though
superior
himself
to
the
ablest
men
at
court
perhaps
even
to
catherine
de
medici
herself
the
astrologer
always
recognized
his
brother
lorenzo
as
his
master
buried
in
studious
solitude
the
old
savant
weighed
and
estimated
sovereigns
most
of
whom
were
worn
out
by
the
perpetual
turmoil
of
politics
the
crises
of
which
at
this
period
came
so
suddenly
and
were
so
keen
so
intense
so
unexpected
he
knew
their
ennui
their
lassitude
their
disgust
with
things
about
them
he
knew
the
ardor
with
which
they
sought
what
seemed
to
them
new
or
strange
or
fantastic
above
all
how
they
loved
to
enter
some
unknown
intellectual
region
to
escape
their
endless
struggle
with
men
and
events
to
those
who
have
exhausted
statecraft
nothing
remains
but
the
realm
of
pure
thought
charles
the
fifth
proved
this
by
his
abdication
charles
who
wrote
sonnets
and
forged
blades
to
escape
the
exhausting
cares
of
an
age
in
which
both
throne
and
king
were
threatened
to
whom
royalty
had
brought
only
cares
and
never
pleasures
was
likely
to
be
roused
to
a
high
pitch
of
interest
by
the
bold
denial
of
his
power
thus
uttered
by
lorenzo
religious
doubt
was
not
surprising
in
an
age
when
catholicism
was
so
violently
arraigned
but
the
upsetting
of
all
religion
given
as
the
basis
of
a
strange
mysterious
art
would
surely
strike
the
king
s
mind
and
drag
it
from
its
present
preoccupations
the
essential
thing
for
the
two
brothers
was
to
make
the
king
forget
his
suspicions
by
turning
his
mind
to
new
ideas
the
ruggieri
were
well
aware
that
their
stake
in
this
game
was
their
own
life
and
the
glances
so
humble
and
yet
so
proud
which
they
exchanged
with
the
searching
suspicious
eyes
of
marie
and
the
king
were
a
scene
in
themselves
sire
said
lorenzo
ruggiero
you
have
asked
me
for
the
truth
but
to
show
the
truth
in
all
her
nakedness
i
must
also
show
you
and
make
you
sound
the
depths
of
the
well
from
which
she
comes
i
appeal
to
the
gentleman
and
the
poet
to
pardon
words
which
the
eldest
son
of
the
church
might
take
for
blasphemy
i
believe
that
god
does
not
concern
himself
with
human
though
determined
to
maintain
a
kingly
composure
charles
ix
could
not
repress
a
motion
of
surprise
without
that
conviction
i
should
have
no
faith
whatever
in
the
miraculous
work
to
which
my
life
is
devoted
to
do
that
work
i
must
have
this
belief
and
if
the
finger
of
god
guides
all
things
then
i
am
a
madman
therefore
let
the
king
understand
once
for
all
that
this
work
means
a
victory
to
be
won
over
the
present
course
of
nature
i
am
an
alchemist
sire
but
do
not
think
as
the
do
that
i
seek
to
make
gold
the
making
of
gold
is
not
the
object
but
an
incident
of
our
researches
otherwise
our
toil
could
not
be
called
the
great
work
the
great
work
is
something
far
loftier
than
that
if
therefore
i
were
forced
to
admit
the
presence
of
god
in
matter
my
voice
must
logically
command
the
extinction
of
furnaces
kept
burning
throughout
the
ages
but
to
deny
the
direct
action
of
god
in
the
world
is
not
to
deny
god
do
not
make
that
mistake
we
place
the
creator
of
all
things
far
higher
than
the
sphere
to
which
religions
have
degraded
him
do
not
accuse
of
atheism
those
who
look
for
immortality
like
lucifer
we
are
jealous
of
our
god
and
jealousy
means
love
though
the
doctrine
of
which
i
speak
is
the
basis
of
our
work
all
our
disciples
are
not
imbued
with
it
cosmo
said
the
old
man
pointing
to
his
brother
cosmo
is
devout
he
pays
for
masses
for
the
repose
of
our
father
s
soul
and
he
goes
to
hear
them
your
mother
s
astrologer
believes
in
the
divinity
of
christ
in
the
immaculate
conception
in
transubstantiation
he
believes
also
in
the
pope
s
indulgences
and
in
hell
and
in
a
multitude
of
such
things
his
hour
has
not
yet
come
i
have
drawn
his
horoscope
he
will
live
to
be
almost
a
centenarian
he
will
live
through
two
more
reigns
and
he
will
see
two
kings
of
france
who
are
they
asked
the
king
the
last
of
the
valois
and
the
first
of
the
bourbons
replied
lorenzo
but
cosmo
shares
my
opinion
it
is
impossible
to
be
an
alchemist
and
a
catholic
to
have
faith
in
the
despotism
of
man
over
matter
and
also
in
the
sovereignty
of
the
cosmo
to
die
a
centenarian
exclaimed
the
king
with
his
terrible
frown
of
the
eyebrows
yes
sire
replied
lorenzo
with
authority
and
he
will
die
peaceably
in
his
if
you
have
power
to
foresee
the
moment
of
your
death
why
are
you
ignorant
of
the
outcome
of
your
researches
asked
the
king
charles
ix
smiled
as
he
said
this
looking
triumphantly
at
marie
touchet
the
brothers
exchanged
a
rapid
glance
of
satisfaction
he
begins
to
be
interested
thought
they
we
are
saved
our
prognostics
depend
on
the
immediate
relations
which
exist
at
the
time
between
man
and
nature
but
our
purpose
itself
is
to
change
those
relations
entirely
replied
lorenzo
the
king
was
thoughtful
but
if
you
are
certain
of
dying
you
are
certain
of
defeat
he
said
at
last
like
our
predecessors
replied
lorenzo
raising
his
hand
and
letting
it
fall
again
with
an
emphatic
and
solemn
gesture
which
presented
visibly
the
grandeur
of
his
thought
but
your
mind
has
bounded
to
the
confines
of
the
matter
sire
we
must
return
upon
our
steps
if
you
do
not
know
the
ground
on
which
our
edifice
is
built
you
may
well
think
it
doomed
to
crumble
with
our
lives
and
so
judge
the
science
cultivated
from
century
to
century
by
the
greatest
among
men
as
the
common
herd
judge
of
the
king
made
a
sign
of
assent
i
think

that
this
earth
belongs
to
man
he
is
the
master
of
it
and
he
can
appropriate
to
his
use
all
forces
and
all
substances
man
is
not
a
creation
issuing
directly
from
the
hand
of
god
but
the
development
of
a
principle
sown
broadcast
into
the
infinite
of
ether
from
which
millions
of
creatures
are
produced
differing
beings
in
different
worlds
because
the
conditions
surrounding
life
are
varied
yes
sire
the
subtle
element
which
we
call
takes
its
rise
beyond
the
visible
worlds
creation
divides
that
principle
according
to
the
centres
into
which
it
flows
and
all
beings
even
the
lowest
share
it
taking
so
much
as
they
can
take
of
it
at
their
own
risk
and
peril
it
is
for
them
to
protect
themselves
from
death
the
whole
purpose
of
alchemy
lies
there
sire
if
man
the
most
perfect
animal
on
this
globe
bore
within
himself
a
portion
of
the
divine
he
would
not
die
but
he
does
die
to
solve
this
difficulty
socrates
and
his
school
invented
the
soul
i
the
successor
of
so
many
great
and
unknown
kings
the
rulers
of
this
science
i
stand
for
the
ancient
theories
not
the
new
i
believe
in
the
transformations
of
matter
which
i
see
and
not
in
the
possible
eternity
of
a
soul
which
i
do
not
see
i
do
not
recognize
that
world
of
the
soul
if
such
a
world
existed
the
substances
whose
magnificent
conjunction
produced
your
body
and
are
so
dazzling
in
that
of
madame
would
not
resolve
themselves
after
your
death
each
into
its
own
element
water
to
water
fire
to
fire
metal
to
metal
just
as
the
elements
of
my
coal
when
burned
return
to
their
primitive
molecules
if
you
believe
that
a
certain
part
of
us
survives
do
not
survive
for
all
that
makes
our
actual
being
perishes
now
it
is
this
actual
being
that
i
am
striving
to
continue
beyond
the
limit
assigned
to
life
it
is
our
present
transformation
to
which
i
wish
to
give
a
greater
duration
why
the
trees
live
for
centuries
but
man
lives
only
years
though
the
former
are
passive
the
others
active
the
first
motionless
and
speechless
the
others
gifted
with
language
and
motion
no
created
thing
should
be
superior
in
this
world
to
man
either
in
power
or
in
duration
already
we
are
widening
our
perceptions
for
we
look
into
the
stars
therefore
we
ought
to
be
able
to
lengthen
the
duration
of
our
lives
i
place
life
before
power
what
good
is
power
if
life
escapes
us
a
wise
man
should
have
no
other
purpose
than
to
seek
not
whether
he
has
some
other
life
within
him
but
the
secret
springs
of
his
actual
form
in
order
that
he
may
prolong
its
existence
at
his
will
that
is
the
desire
which
has
whitened
my
hair
but
i
walk
boldly
in
the
darkness
marshalling
to
the
search
all
those
great
intellects
that
share
my
faith
life
will
some
day
be
ours
ours
to
ah
but
how
cried
the
king
rising
hastily
the
first
condition
of
our
faith
being
that
the
earth
belongs
to
man
you
must
grant
me
that
point
said
lorenzo
so
be
it
said
charles
de
valois
already
under
the
spell
then
sire
if
we
take
god
out
of
this
world
what
remains
man
let
us
therefore
examine
our
domain
the
material
world
is
composed
of
elements
these
elements
are
themselves
principles
these
principles
resolve
themselves
into
an
ultimate
principle
endowed
with
motion
the
number
three
is
the
formula
of
creation
matter
motion
stop
cried
the
king
what
proof
is
there
of
this
do
you
not
see
the
effects
replied
lorenzo
we
have
tried
in
our
crucibles
the
acorn
which
produces
the
oak
and
the
embryo
from
which
grows
a
man
from
this
tiny
substance
results
a
single
principle
to
which
some
force
some
movement
must
be
given
since
there
is
no
overruling
creator
this
principle
must
give
to
itself
the
outward
forms
which
constitute
our
world
for
this
phenomenon
of
life
is
the
same
everywhere
yes
for
metals
as
for
human
beings
for
plants
as
for
men
life
begins
in
an
imperceptible
embryo
which
develops
itself
a
primitive
principle
exists
let
us
seize
it
at
the
point
where
it
begins
to
act
upon
itself
where
it
is
a
unit
where
it
is
a
principle
before
taking
definite
form
a
cause
before
being
an
effect
we
must
see
it
single
without
form
susceptible
of
clothing
itself
with
all
the
outward
forms
we
shall
see
it
take
when
we
are
face
to
face
with
this
atomic
particle
when
we
shall
have
caught
its
movement
at
the
very
instant
of
motion
we
shall
know
the
law
thenceforth
we
are
the
masters
of
life
masters
who
can
impose
upon
that
principle
the
form
we
choose
with
gold
to
win
the
world
and
the
power
to
make
for
ourselves
centuries
of
life
in
which
to
enjoy
it
that
is
what
my
people
and
i
are
seeking
all
our
strength
all
our
thoughts
are
strained
in
that
direction
nothing
distracts
us
from
it
one
hour
wasted
on
any
other
passion
is
a
theft
committed
against
our
true
grandeur
just
as
you
have
never
found
your
hounds
relinquishing
the
hunted
animal
or
failing
to
be
in
at
the
death
so
i
have
never
seen
one
of
my
patient
disciples
diverted
from
this
great
quest
by
the
love
of
woman
or
a
selfish
thought
if
an
adept
seeks
power
and
wealth
the
desire
is
instigated
by
our
needs
he
grasps
treasure
as
a
thirsty
dog
laps
water
while
he
swims
a
stream
because
his
crucibles
are
in
need
of
a
diamond
to
melt
or
an
ingot
of
gold
to
reduce
to
powder
to
each
his
own
work
one
seeks
the
secret
of
vegetable
nature
he
watches
the
slow
life
of
plants
he
notes
the
parity
of
motion
among
all
the
species
and
the
parity
of
their
nutrition
he
finds
everywhere
the
need
of
sun
and
air
and
water
to
fecundate
and
nourish
them
another
scrutinizes
the
blood
of
animals
a
third
studies
the
laws
of
universal
motion
and
its
connection
with
celestial
revolutions
nearly
all
are
eager
to
struggle
with
the
intractable
nature
of
metal
for
while
we
find
many
principles
in
other
things
we
find
all
metals
like
unto
themselves
in
every
particular
hence
a
common
error
as
to
our
work
behold
these
patient
indefatigable
athletes
ever
vanquished
yet
ever
returning
to
the
combat
humanity
sire
is
behind
us
as
the
huntsman
is
behind
your
hounds
she
cries
to
us
make
haste
neglect
nothing
sacrifice
all
even
a
man
ye
who
sacrifice
yourselves
hasten
hasten
beat
down
the
arms
of
death
mine
enemy
yes
sire
we
are
inspired
by
a
hope
which
involves
the
happiness
of
all
coming
generations
we
have
buried
many
men
and
what
men
dying
of
this
search
setting
foot
in
this
career
we
can
not
work
for
ourselves
we
may
die
without
discovering
the
secret
and
our
death
is
that
of
those
who
do
not
believe
in
another
life
it
is
this
life
that
we
have
sought
and
failed
to
perpetuate
we
are
glorious
martyrs
we
have
the
welfare
of
the
race
at
heart
we
have
failed
but
we
live
again
in
our
successors
as
we
go
through
this
existence
we
discover
secrets
with
which
we
endow
the
liberal
and
the
mechanical
arts
from
our
furnaces
gleam
lights
which
illumine
industrial
enterprises
and
perfect
them
gunpowder
issued
from
our
alembics
nay
we
have
mastered
the
lightning
in
our
persistent
vigils
lie
political
can
this
be
true
cried
the
king
springing
once
more
from
his
chair
why
not
said
the
of
the
new
templars
mundum
god
has
given
us
the
earth
hear
this
once
more
man
is
master
here
below
matter
is
his
all
forces
all
means
are
at
his
disposal
who
created
us
motion
what
power
maintains
life
in
us
motion
why
can
not
science
seize
the
secret
of
that
motion
nothing
is
lost
here
below
nothing
escapes
from
our
planet
to
go
elsewhere
otherwise
the
stars
would
stumble
over
each
other
the
waters
of
the
deluge
are
still
with
us
in
their
principle
and
not
a
drop
is
lost
around
us
above
us
beneath
us
are
to
be
found
the
elements
from
which
have
come
innumerable
hosts
of
men
who
have
crowded
the
earth
before
and
since
the
deluge
what
is
the
secret
of
our
struggle
to
discover
the
force
that
disunites
and
then
we
shall
discover
that
which
binds
we
are
the
product
of
a
visible
manufacture
when
the
waters
covered
the
globe
men
issued
from
them
who
found
the
elements
of
their
life
in
the
crust
of
the
earth
in
the
air
and
in
the
nourishment
derived
from
them
earth
and
air
possess
therefore
the
principle
of
human
transformations
those
transformations
take
place
under
our
eyes
by
means
of
that
which
is
also
under
our
eyes
we
are
able
therefore
to
discover
that
secret
not
limiting
the
effort
of
the
search
to
one
man
or
to
one
age
but
devoting
humanity
in
its
duration
to
it
we
are
engaged
hand
to
hand
in
a
struggle
with
matter
into
whose
secret
i
the
of
our
order
seek
to
penetrate
christophe
columbus
gave
a
world
to
the
king
of
spain
i
seek
an
people
for
the
king
of
france
standing
on
the
confines
which
separate
us
from
a
knowledge
of
material
things
a
patient
observer
of
atoms
i
destroy
forms
i
dissolve
the
bonds
of
combinations
i
imitate
death
that
i
may
learn
how
to
imitate
life
i
strike
incessantly
at
the
door
of
creation
and
i
shall
continue
so
to
strike
until
the
day
of
my
death
when
i
am
dead
the
knocker
will
pass
into
other
hands
equally
persistent
with
those
of
the
mighty
men
who
handed
it
to
me
fabulous
and
uncomprehended
beings
like
prometheus
ixion
adonis
pan
and
others
who
have
entered
into
the
religious
beliefs
of
all
countries
and
all
ages
prove
to
the
world
that
the
hopes
we
now
embody
were
born
with
the
human
races
chaldea
india
persia
egypt
greece
the
moors
have
transmitted
from
one
to
another
magic
the
highest
of
all
the
occult
sciences
which
holds
within
it
as
a
precious
deposit
the
fruits
of
the
studies
of
each
generation
in
it
lay
the
tie
that
bound
the
grand
and
majestic
institution
of
the
templars
sire
when
one
of
your
predecessors
burned
the
templars
he
burned
men
only
their
secret
lived
the
reconstruction
of
the
temple
is
a
vow
of
an
unknown
nation
a
race
of
daring
seekers
whose
faces
are
turned
to
the
orient
of
all
brothers
all
inseparable
all
united
by
one
idea
and
stamped
with
the
mark
of
toil
i
am
the
sovereign
leader
of
that
people
sovereign
by
election
not
by
birth
i
guide
them
onward
to
a
knowledge
of
the
essence
of
life
companions
adepts
we
forever
follow
the
imperceptible
molecule
which
still
escapes
our
eyes
but
soon
we
shall
make
ourselves
eyes
more
powerful
than
those
which
nature
has
given
us
we
shall
attain
to
a
sight
of
the
primitive
atom
the
corpuscular
element
so
persistently
sought
by
the
wise
and
learned
of
all
ages
who
have
preceded
us
in
the
glorious
search
sire
when
a
man
is
astride
of
that
abyss
when
he
commands
bold
divers
like
my
disciples
all
other
human
interests
are
as
nothing
therefore
we
are
not
dangerous
religious
disputes
and
political
struggles
are
far
away
from
us
we
have
passed
beyond
and
above
them
no
man
takes
others
by
the
throat
when
his
whole
strength
is
given
to
a
struggle
with
nature
besides
in
our
science
results
are
perceivable
we
can
measure
effects
and
predict
them
whereas
all
things
are
uncertain
and
vacillating
in
the
struggles
of
men
and
their
selfish
interests
we
decompose
the
diamond
in
our
crucibles
and
we
shall
make
diamonds
we
shall
make
gold
we
shall
impel
vessels
as
they
have
at
barcelona
with
fire
and
a
little
water
we
test
the
wind
and
we
shall
make
wind
we
shall
make
light
we
shall
renew
the
face
of
empires
with
new
industries
but
we
shall
never
debase
ourselves
to
mount
a
throne
to
be
crucified
by
the
peoples
in
spite
of
his
strong
determination
not
to
be
taken
in
by
italian
wiles
the
king
together
with
his
gentle
mistress
was
already
caught
and
snared
by
the
ambiguous
phrases
and
doublings
of
this
pompous
and
humbugging
loquacity
the
eyes
of
the
two
lovers
showed
how
their
minds
were
dazzled
by
the
mysterious
riches
of
power
thus
displayed
they
saw
as
it
were
a
series
of
subterranean
caverns
filled
with
gnomes
at
their
toil
the
impatience
of
their
curiosity
put
to
flight
all
suspicion
but
cried
the
king
if
this
be
so
you
are
great
statesmen
who
can
enlighten
no
sire
said
lorenzo
naively
why
not
asked
the
king
sire
it
is
not
given
to
any
man
to
foresee
what
will
happen
when
thousands
of
men
are
gathered
together
we
can
tell
what
one
man
will
do
how
long
he
will
live
whether
he
will
be
happy
or
unhappy
but
we
can
not
tell
what
a
collection
of
wills
may
do
and
to
calculate
the
oscillations
of
their
selfish
interests
is
more
difficult
still
for
interests
are
men
things
we
can
in
solitude
see
the
future
as
a
whole
and
that
is
all
the
protestantism
that
now
torments
you
will
be
destroyed
in
turn
by
its
material
consequences
which
will
turn
to
theories
in
due
time
europe
is
at
the
present
moment
getting
the
better
of
religion
it
will
attack
then
the
was
a
great
conception
yes
sire
for
if
the
people
triumph
it
will
have
a
of
its
own
when
religion
and
royalty
are
destroyed
the
people
will
attack
the
nobles
after
the
nobles
the
rich
when
europe
has
become
a
mere
troop
of
men
without
consistence
or
stability
because
without
leaders
it
will
fall
a
prey
to
brutal
conquerors
twenty
times
already
has
the
world
seen
that
sight
and
europe
is
now
preparing
to
renew
it
ideas
consume
the
ages
as
passions
consume
men
when
man
is
cured
humanity
may
possibly
cure
itself
science
is
the
essence
of
humanity
and
we
are
its
pontiffs
whoso
concerns
himself
about
the
essence
cares
little
about
the
individual
to
what
have
you
attained
so
far
asked
the
king
we
advance
slowly
but
we
lose
nothing
that
we
have
then
you
are
the
king
of
sorcerers
retorted
the
king
piqued
at
being
of
no
account
in
the
presence
of
this
man
the
majestic
of
the
rosicrucians
cast
a
look
on
charles
ix
which
withered
him
you
are
the
king
of
men
he
said
i
am
the
king
of
ideas
if
we
were
sorcerers
you
would
already
have
burned
us
we
have
had
our
but
by
what
means
are
you
able
to
cast
nativities
persisted
the
king
how
did
you
know
that
the
man
who
came
to
your
window
last
night
was
king
of
france
what
power
authorized
one
of
you
to
tell
my
mother
the
fate
of
her
three
sons
can
you
of
an
art
which
claims
to
mould
the
world
can
you
tell
me
what
my
mother
is
planning
at
this
moment
yes
this
answer
was
given
before
cosmo
could
pull
his
brother
s
robe
to
enjoin
silence
do
you
know
why
my
brother
the
king
of
poland
has
returned
yes
why
to
take
your
our
most
cruel
enemies
are
our
nearest
in
blood
exclaimed
the
king
violently
rising
and
walking
about
the
room
with
hasty
steps
kings
have
neither
brothers
nor
sons
nor
mothers
coligny
was
right
my
murderers
are
not
among
the
huguenots
but
in
the
louvre
you
are
either
imposters
or
regicides
jacob
call
sire
said
marie
touchet
the
ruggieri
have
your
word
as
a
gentleman
you
wanted
to
taste
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
do
not
complain
of
its
the
king
smiled
with
an
expression
of
bitter
he
thought
his
material
royalty
petty
in
presence
of
the
august
intellectual
royalty
of
lorenzo
ruggiero
charles
ix
knew
that
he
could
scarcely
govern
france
but
this
of
rosicrucians
ruled
a
submissive
and
intelligent
world
answer
me
truthfully
i
pledge
my
word
as
a
gentleman
that
your
answer
in
case
it
confesses
dreadful
crimes
shall
be
as
if
it
were
never
uttered
resumed
the
king
do
you
deal
with
poisons
to
discover
that
which
gives
life
we
must
also
have
full
knowledge
of
that
which
do
you
possess
the
secret
of
many
poisons
yes
sire
in
theory
but
not
in
practice
we
understand
all
poisons
but
do
not
use
has
my
mother
asked
you
for
any
said
the
king
breathlessly
sire
replied
lorenzo
queen
catherine
is
too
able
a
woman
to
employ
such
means
she
knows
that
the
sovereign
who
poisons
dies
by
poison
the
borgias
also
bianca
capello
grand
duchess
of
tuscany
are
noted
examples
of
the
dangers
of
that
miserable
resource
all
things
are
known
at
courts
there
can
be
no
concealment
it
may
be
possible
to
kill
a
poor
devil
and
what
is
the
good
of
that
but
to
aim
at
great
men
can
not
be
done
secretly
who
shot
coligny
it
could
only
be
you
or
the
or
the
guises
not
a
soul
is
doubtful
of
that
believe
me
poison
can
not
be
twice
used
with
impunity
in
statecraft
princes
have
successors
as
for
other
men
if
like
luther
they
are
sovereigns
through
the
power
of
ideas
their
doctrines
are
not
killed
by
killing
them
the
queen
is
from
florence
she
knows
that
poison
should
never
be
used
except
as
a
weapon
of
personal
revenge
my
brother
who
has
not
been
parted
from
her
since
her
arrival
in
france
knows
the
grief
that
madame
diane
caused
your
mother
but
she
never
thought
of
poisoning
her
though
she
might
easily
have
done
so
what
could
your
father
have
said
never
had
a
woman
a
better
right
to
do
it
and
she
could
have
done
it
with
impunity
but
madame
de
valentinois
still
but
what
of
those
waxen
images
asked
the
king
sire
said
cosmo
these
things
are
so
absolutely
harmless
that
we
lend
ourselves
to
the
practice
to
satisfy
blind
passions
just
as
physicians
give
bread
pills
to
imaginary
invalids
a
disappointed
woman
fancies
that
by
stabbing
the
heart
of
a
she
has
brought
misfortunes
upon
the
head
of
the
man
who
has
been
unfaithful
to
her
what
harm
in
that
besides
it
is
our
the
pope
sells
indulgences
said
lorenzo
ruggiero
smiling
has
my
mother
practised
these
spells
with
waxen
images
what
good
would
such
harmless
means
be
to
one
who
has
the
actual
power
to
do
all
things
has
queen
catherine
the
power
to
save
you
at
this
moment
inquired
the
king
in
a
threatening
manner
sire
we
are
not
in
any
danger
replied
lorenzo
tranquilly
i
knew
before
i
came
into
this
house
that
i
should
leave
it
safely
just
as
i
know
that
the
king
will
be
evilly
disposed
to
my
brother
cosmo
a
few
weeks
hence
my
brother
may
run
some
danger
then
but
he
will
escape
it
if
the
king
reigns
by
the
sword
he
also
reigns
by
justice
added
the
old
man
alluding
to
the
famous
motto
on
a
medal
struck
for
charles
ix
you
know
all
and
you
know
that
i
shall
die
soon
which
is
very
well
said
the
king
hiding
his
anger
under
nervous
impatience
but
how
will
my
brother
die
he
whom
you
say
is
to
be
henri
iii
by
a
violent
and
the
duc
d
alencon
he
will
not
then
henri
de
bourbon
will
be
king
of
france
yes
how
will
he
die
by
a
violent
when
i
am
dead
what
will
become
of
madame
asked
the
king
motioning
to
marie
touchet
madame
de
belleville
will
marry
you
are
imposters
cried
marie
touchet
send
them
away
dearest
the
ruggieri
have
my
word
as
a
gentleman
replied
the
king
smiling
will
madame
have
children
he
continued
yes
sire
and
madame
will
live
to
be
more
than
eighty
years
shall
i
order
them
to
be
hanged
said
the
king
to
his
mistress
but
about
my
son
the
comte
d
auvergne
he
continued
going
into
the
next
room
to
fetch
the
child
why
did
you
tell
him
i
should
marry
said
marie
to
the
two
brothers
the
moment
they
were
alone
madame
replied
lorenzo
with
dignity
the
king
bound
us
to
tell
the
truth
and
we
have
told
that
true
she
exclaimed
as
true
as
it
is
that
the
governor
of
the
city
of
orleans
is
madly
in
love
with
but
i
do
not
love
him
she
cried
that
is
true
madame
replied
lorenzo
but
your
horoscope
declares
that
you
will
marry
the
man
who
is
in
love
with
you
at
the
present
can
you
not
lie
a
little
for
my
sake
she
said
smiling
for
if
the
king
believes
your
predictions
is
it
not
also
necessary
that
he
should
believe
our
innocence
interrupted
cosmo
with
a
wily
glance
at
the
young
favorite
the
precautions
taken
against
us
by
the
king
have
made
us
think
during
the
time
we
have
spent
in
your
charming
jail
that
the
occult
sciences
have
been
traduced
to
do
not
feel
uneasy
replied
marie
i
know
him
his
suspicions
are
at
an
we
are
innocent
said
the
of
the
rosicrucians
proudly
so
much
the
better
for
you
said
marie
for
your
laboratory
and
your
retorts
and
phials
are
now
being
searched
by
order
of
the
the
brothers
looked
at
each
other
smiling
marie
touchet
took
that
smile
for
one
of
innocence
though
it
really
signified
poor
fools
can
they
suppose
that
if
we
brew
poisons
we
do
not
hide
them
where
are
the
king
s
searchers
in
rene
s
laboratory
replied
marie
again
the
brothers
glanced
at
each
other
with
a
look
which
said
the
hotel
de
soissons
is
the
king
had
so
completely
forgotten
his
suspicions
that
when
as
he
took
his
boy
in
his
arms
jacob
gave
him
a
note
from
chapelain
he
opened
it
with
the
certainty
of
finding
in
his
physician
s
report
that
nothing
had
been
discovered
in
the
laboratory
but
what
related
exclusively
to
alchemy
will
he
live
a
happy
man
asked
the
king
presenting
his
son
to
the
two
alchemists
that
is
a
question
which
concerns
cosmo
replied
lorenzo
signing
his
brother
cosmo
took
the
tiny
hand
of
the
child
and
examined
it
carefully
monsieur
said
charles
ix
to
the
old
man
if
you
find
it
necessary
to
deny
the
existence
of
the
soul
in
order
to
believe
in
the
possibility
of
your
enterprise
will
you
explain
to
my
why
you
should
doubt
what
your
power
does
thought
which
you
seek
to
nullify
is
the
certainty
the
torch
which
lights
your
researches
ha
ha
is
not
that
the
motion
of
a
spirit
within
you
while
you
deny
such
motion
cried
the
king
pleased
with
his
argument
and
looking
triumphantly
at
his
mistress
thought
replied
lorenzo
ruggiero
is
the
exercise
of
an
inward
sense
just
as
the
faculty
of
seeing
several
objects
and
noticing
their
size
and
color
is
an
effect
of
sight
it
has
no
connection
with
what
people
choose
to
call
another
life
thought
is
a
faculty
which
ceases
with
the
forces
which
produced
it
when
we
cease
to
you
are
logical
said
the
king
surprised
but
alchemy
must
therefore
be
an
atheistical
a
materialist
science
sire
which
is
a
very
different
thing
materialism
is
the
outcome
of
indian
doctrines
transmitted
through
the
mysteries
of
isis
to
chaldea
and
egypt
and
brought
to
greece
by
pythagoras
one
of
the
demigods
of
humanity
his
doctrine
of
is
the
mathematics
of
materialism
the
vital
law
of
its
phases
to
each
of
the
different
creations
which
form
the
terrestrial
creation
belongs
the
power
of
retarding
the
movement
which
sweeps
on
the
alchemy
is
the
science
of
sciences
cried
charles
enthusiastically
i
want
to
see
you
at
whenever
it
pleases
you
sire
you
can
not
be
more
interested
than
madame
the
ah
so
this
is
why
she
cares
for
you
exclaimed
the
king
the
house
of
medici
has
secretly
protected
our
search
for
more
than
a
sire
said
cosmo
this
child
will
live
nearly
a
hundred
years
he
will
have
trials
nevertheless
he
will
be
happy
and
honored
because
he
has
in
his
veins
the
blood
of
the
i
will
go
and
see
you
in
your
laboratory
messieurs
said
the
king
his
quite
restored
you
may
now
the
brothers
bowed
to
marie
and
to
the
king
and
then
withdrew
they
went
down
the
steps
of
the
portico
gravely
without
looking
or
speaking
to
each
other
neither
did
they
turn
their
faces
to
the
windows
as
they
crossed
the
courtyard
feeling
sure
that
the
king
s
eye
watched
them
but
as
they
passed
sideways
out
of
the
gate
into
the
street
they
looked
back
and
saw
charles
ix
gazing
after
them
from
a
window
when
the
alchemist
and
the
astrologer
were
safely
in
the
rue
de
l
autruche
they
cast
their
eyes
before
and
behind
them
to
see
if
they
were
followed
or
overheard
then
they
continued
their
way
to
the
moat
of
the
louvre
without
uttering
a
word
once
there
however
feeling
themselves
securely
alone
lorenzo
said
to
cosmo
in
the
tuscan
italian
of
that
day
affe
d
iddio
how
we
have
fooled
him
much
good
may
it
do
him
let
him
make
what
he
can
of
it
said
cosmo
we
have
given
him
a
helping
hand
whether
the
queen
pays
it
back
to
us
or
some
days
after
this
scene
which
struck
the
king
s
mistress
as
forcibly
as
it
did
the
king
marie
suddenly
exclaimed
in
one
of
those
moments
when
the
soul
seems
as
it
were
disengaged
from
the
body
in
the
plenitude
of
happiness
charles
i
understand
lorenzo
ruggiero
but
did
you
observe
that
cosmo
said
nothing
true
said
the
king
struck
by
that
sudden
light
after
all
there
was
as
much
falsehood
as
truth
in
what
they
said
those
italians
are
as
supple
as
the
silk
they
this
suspicion
explains
the
rancor
which
the
king
showed
against
cosmo
when
the
trial
of
la
mole
and
coconnas
took
place
a
few
weeks
later
finding
him
one
of
the
agents
of
that
conspiracy
he
thought
the
italians
had
tricked
him
for
it
was
proved
that
his
mother
s
astrologer
was
not
exclusively
concerned
with
stars
the
powder
of
projection
and
the
primitive
atom
lorenzo
had
by
that
time
left
the
kingdom
in
spite
of
the
incredulity
which
most
persons
show
in
these
matters
the
events
which
followed
the
scene
we
have
narrated
confirmed
the
predictions
of
the
ruggieri
the
king
died
within
three
months
charles
de
gondi
followed
charles
ix
to
the
grave
as
had
been
foretold
to
him
jestingly
by
his
brother
the
marechal
de
retz
a
friend
of
the
ruggieri
who
believed
in
their
predictions
marie
touchet
married
charles
de
balzac
marquis
d
entragues
the
governor
of
orleans
by
whom
she
had
two
daughters
the
most
celebrated
of
these
daughters
the
of
the
comte
d
auvergne
was
the
mistress
of
henri
and
it
was
she
who
endeavored
at
the
time
of
biron
s
conspiracy
to
put
her
brother
on
the
throne
of
france
by
driving
out
the
bourbons
the
comte
d
auvergne
who
became
the
duc
d
angouleme
lived
into
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
he
coined
money
on
his
estates
and
altered
the
inscriptions
but
louis
xiv
let
him
do
as
he
pleased
out
of
respect
for
the
blood
of
the
valois
cosmo
ruggiero
lived
till
the
middle
of
the
reign
of
louis
xiii
he
witnessed
the
fall
of
the
house
of
the
medici
in
france
also
that
of
the
concini
history
has
taken
pains
to
record
that
he
died
an
atheist
that
is
a
materialist
the
marquise
d
entragues
was
over
eighty
when
she
died
the
famous
comte
de
who
made
so
much
noise
under
louis
was
a
pupil
of
lorenzo
and
cosmo
ruggiero
this
celebrated
alchemist
lived
to
be
one
hundred
and
thirty
years
old
an
age
which
some
biographers
give
to
marion
de
lorme
he
must
have
heard
from
the
ruggieri
the
various
incidents
of
the
and
of
the
reigns
of
the
valois
kings
which
he
afterwards
recounted
in
the
first
person
singular
as
though
he
had
played
a
part
in
them
the
comte
de
was
the
last
of
the
alchemists
who
knew
how
to
clearly
explain
their
science
but
he
left
no
writings
the
cabalistic
doctrine
presented
in
this
study
is
that
taught
by
this
mysterious
personage
and
here
behold
a
strange
thing
three
lives
that
of
the
old
man
from
whom
i
have
obtained
these
facts
that
of
the
comte
de
and
that
of
cosmo
ruggiero
suffice
to
cover
the
whole
of
european
history
from
francois
to
napoleon
only
fifty
such
lives
are
needed
to
reach
back
to
the
first
known
period
of
the
world
what
are
fifty
generations
for
the
study
of
the
mysteries
of
life
said
the
comte
de
part
iii
i
two
dreams
in
bodard
de
treasurer
of
the
navy
excited
more
attention
and
gossip
as
to
his
luxury
than
any
other
financier
in
paris
at
this
period
he
was
building
his
famous
folie
at
neuilly
and
his
wife
had
just
bought
a
set
of
feathers
to
crown
the
tester
of
her
bed
the
price
of
which
had
been
too
great
for
even
the
queen
to
pay
bodard
owned
the
magnificent
mansion
in
the
place
vendome
which
the
dange
had
lately
been
forced
to
leave
that
celebrated
epicurean
was
now
dead
and
on
the
day
of
his
interment
his
intimate
friend
monsieur
de
bievre
raised
a
laugh
by
saying
that
he
could
now
pass
through
the
place
vendome
without
this
allusion
to
the
hellish
gambling
which
went
on
in
the
dead
man
s
house
was
his
only
funeral
oration
the
house
is
opposite
to
the
chancellerie
to
end
in
a
few
words
the
history
of
bodard
he
became
a
poor
man
having
failed
for
fourteen
millions
after
the
bankruptcy
of
the
prince
de
guemenee
the
stupidity
he
showed
in
not
anticipating
that
serenissime
disaster
to
use
the
expression
of
lebrun
pindare
was
the
reason
why
no
notice
was
taken
of
his
misfortunes
he
died
like
bourvalais
bouret
and
so
many
others
in
a
garret
madame
bodard
de
was
ambitious
and
professed
to
receive
none
but
persons
of
quality
at
her
house
an
old
absurdity
which
is
ever
new
to
her
thinking
even
the
parliamentary
judges
were
of
small
account
she
wished
for
titled
persons
in
her
salons
or
at
all
events
those
who
had
the
right
of
entrance
at
court
to
say
that
many
were
seen
at
her
house
would
be
false
but
it
is
quite
certain
that
she
managed
to
obtain
the
and
civilities
of
several
members
of
the
house
of
rohan
as
was
proved
later
in
the
affair
of
the
too
celebrated
diamond
necklace
one
evening
it
was
i
think
in
august
i
was
much
surprised
to
meet
in
the
salons
of
this
lady
so
exacting
in
the
matter
of
gentility
two
new
faces
which
struck
me
as
belonging
to
men
of
inferior
social
position
she
came
to
me
presently
in
the
embrasure
of
a
window
where
i
had
ensconced
myself
tell
me
i
said
to
her
with
a
glance
toward
one
of
the
who
and
what
is
that
queer
species
why
do
you
have
that
kind
of
thing
here
he
is
do
you
see
him
through
a
prism
of
love
or
am
i
blind
you
are
not
blind
she
said
laughing
the
man
is
as
ugly
as
a
caterpillar
but
he
has
done
me
the
most
immense
service
a
woman
can
receive
from
a
as
i
looked
at
her
rather
maliciously
she
hastened
to
add
he
s
a
physician
and
he
has
completely
cured
me
of
those
odious
red
blotches
which
spoiled
my
complexion
and
made
me
look
like
a
peasant
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
with
disgust
he
is
a
no
she
said
he
is
the
surgeon
of
the
court
pages
he
has
a
fine
intellect
i
assure
you
in
fact
he
is
a
writer
and
a
very
learned
heavens
if
his
style
resembles
his
face
i
said
scoffingly
but
who
is
the
other
what
other
that
spruce
affected
little
popinjay
over
there
who
looks
as
if
he
had
been
drinking
he
is
a
rather
man
she
replied
just
arrived
from
some
province
i
forget
which
oh
from
artois
he
is
sent
here
to
conclude
an
affair
in
which
the
cardinal
de
rohan
is
interested
and
his
eminence
in
person
had
just
presented
him
to
monsieur
de
it
seems
they
have
both
chosen
my
husband
as
arbitrator
the
provincial
didn
t
show
his
wisdom
in
that
but
fancy
what
simpletons
the
people
who
sent
him
here
must
be
to
trust
a
case
to
a
man
of
his
sort
he
is
as
meek
as
a
sheep
and
as
timid
as
a
girl
his
eminence
is
very
kind
to
what
is
the
nature
of
the
affair
oh
a
question
of
three
hundred
thousand
then
the
man
is
a
lawyer
i
said
with
a
slight
shrug
yes
she
replied
somewhat
confused
by
this
humiliating
avowal
madame
bodard
returned
to
her
place
at
a
all
the
tables
were
full
i
had
nothing
to
do
no
one
to
speak
to
and
i
had
just
lost
two
thousand
crowns
to
monsieur
de
laval
i
flung
myself
on
a
sofa
near
the
fireplace
presently
if
there
was
ever
a
man
on
earth
most
utterly
astonished
it
was
i
when
on
looking
up
i
saw
seated
on
another
sofa
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fireplace
monsieur
de
calonne
the
he
seemed
to
be
dozing
or
else
he
was
buried
in
one
of
those
deep
meditations
which
overtake
statesmen
when
i
pointed
out
the
famous
minister
to
beaumarchais
who
happened
to
come
near
me
at
that
moment
the
father
of
figaro
explained
the
mystery
of
his
presence
in
that
house
without
uttering
a
word
he
pointed
first
at
my
head
then
at
bodard
s
with
a
malicious
gesture
which
consisted
in
turning
to
each
of
us
two
fingers
of
his
hand
while
he
kept
the
others
doubled
up
my
first
impulse
was
to
rise
and
say
something
rousing
to
calonne
then
i
paused
first
because
i
thought
of
a
trick
i
could
play
the
statesman
and
secondly
because
beaumarchais
caught
me
familiarly
by
the
hand
why
do
you
do
that
monsieur
i
said
he
winked
at
the
comptroller
don
t
wake
him
he
said
in
a
low
voice
a
man
is
happy
when
pray
is
sleep
a
financial
scheme
i
whispered
indeed
yes
said
calonne
who
had
guessed
our
words
from
the
mere
motion
of
our
lips
would
to
god
we
could
sleep
long
and
then
the
awakening
you
are
about
to
see
would
never
monseigneur
said
the
dramatist
i
must
thank
you
for
what
monsieur
de
mirabeau
has
started
for
berlin
i
don
t
know
whether
we
might
not
both
have
drowned
ourselves
in
that
affair
of
les
you
have
too
much
memory
and
too
little
gratitude
replied
the
minister
annoyed
at
having
one
of
his
secrets
divulged
in
my
presence
possibly
said
beaumarchais
cut
to
the
quick
but
i
have
millions
that
can
balance
many
a
calonne
pretended
not
to
hear
it
was
long
past
midnight
when
the
play
ceased
supper
was
announced
there
were
ten
of
us
at
table
bodard
and
his
wife
calonne
beaumarchais
the
two
strange
men
two
pretty
women
whose
names
i
will
not
give
here
a
lavoisier
and
myself
out
of
thirty
guests
who
were
in
the
salon
when
i
entered
it
only
these
ten
remained
the
two
did
not
consent
to
stay
until
they
were
urged
to
do
so
by
madame
bodard
who
probably
thought
she
was
paying
her
obligations
to
the
surgeon
by
giving
him
something
to
eat
and
pleasing
her
husband
with
whom
she
appeared
i
don
t
precisely
know
why
to
be
coquetting
by
inviting
the
lawyer
the
supper
began
by
being
frightfully
dull
the
two
strangers
and
the
oppressed
us
i
made
a
sign
to
beaumarchais
to
intoxicate
the
son
of
esculapius
who
sat
on
his
right
giving
him
to
understand
that
i
would
do
the
same
by
the
lawyer
who
was
next
to
me
as
there
seemed
no
other
way
to
amuse
ourselves
and
it
offered
a
chance
to
draw
out
the
two
men
who
were
already
sufficiently
singular
monsieur
de
calonne
smiled
at
our
project
the
ladies
present
also
shared
in
the
bacchanal
conspiracy
and
the
wine
of
sillery
crowned
our
glasses
again
and
again
with
its
silvery
foam
the
surgeon
was
easily
managed
but
at
the
second
glass
which
i
offered
to
my
neighbor
the
lawyer
he
told
me
with
the
frigid
politeness
of
a
usurer
that
he
should
drink
no
more
at
this
instant
madame
de
chanced
to
introduce
i
scarcely
know
how
the
topic
of
the
marvellous
suppers
to
the
comte
de
cagliostro
given
by
the
cardinal
de
rohan
my
mind
was
not
very
attentive
to
what
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
saying
because
i
was
watching
with
extreme
curiosity
the
pinched
and
livid
face
of
my
little
neighbor
whose
principal
feature
was
a
and
at
the
same
time
pointed
nose
which
made
him
at
times
look
very
like
a
weasel
suddenly
his
cheeks
flushed
as
he
caught
the
words
of
a
dispute
between
madame
de
and
monsieur
de
calonne
but
i
assure
you
monsieur
she
was
saying
with
an
imperious
air
that
i
cleopatra
the
i
can
believe
it
madame
said
my
neighbor
for
i
myself
have
spoken
to
catherine
de
oh
oh
exclaimed
monsieur
de
calonne
the
words
uttered
by
the
little
provincial
were
said
in
a
voice
of
strange
sonorousness
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
borrow
that
expression
from
the
science
of
physics
this
sudden
clearness
of
intonation
coming
from
a
man
who
had
hitherto
scarcely
spoken
and
then
in
a
low
and
modulated
tone
surprised
all
present
exceedingly
why
he
is
talking
said
the
surgeon
who
was
now
in
a
satisfactory
state
of
drunkenness
addressing
beaumarchais
his
neighbor
must
have
pulled
his
wires
replied
the
satirist
my
man
flushed
again
as
he
overheard
the
words
though
they
were
said
in
a
low
voice
and
pray
how
was
the
late
queen
asked
calonne
jestingly
i
will
not
swear
that
the
person
with
whom
i
supped
last
night
at
the
house
of
the
cardinal
de
rohan
was
catherine
de
medici
in
person
that
miracle
would
justly
seem
impossible
to
christians
as
well
as
to
philosophers
said
the
little
lawyer
resting
the
tips
of
his
fingers
on
the
table
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
as
if
preparing
to
make
a
speech
nevertheless
i
do
assert
that
the
woman
i
saw
resembled
catherine
de
medici
as
closely
as
though
they
were
she
was
dressed
in
a
black
velvet
gown
precisely
like
that
of
the
queen
in
the
portrait
which
belongs
to
the
king
on
her
head
was
the
pointed
velvet
coif
which
is
characteristic
of
her
and
she
had
the
wan
complexion
and
the
features
we
all
know
well
i
could
not
help
betraying
my
surprise
to
his
eminence
the
suddenness
of
the
evocation
seemed
to
me
all
the
more
amazing
because
monsieur
de
cagliostro
had
been
unable
to
divine
the
name
of
the
person
with
whom
i
wished
to
communicate
i
was
confounded
the
magical
spectacle
of
a
supper
where
one
of
the
illustrious
women
of
past
times
presented
herself
took
from
me
my
presence
of
mind
i
listened
without
daring
to
question
when
i
roused
myself
about
midnight
from
the
spell
of
that
magic
i
was
inclined
to
doubt
my
senses
but
even
this
great
marvel
seemed
natural
in
comparison
with
the
singular
hallucination
to
which
i
was
presently
subjected
i
don
t
know
in
what
words
i
can
describe
to
you
the
state
of
my
senses
but
i
declare
in
the
sincerity
of
my
heart
i
no
longer
wonder
that
souls
have
been
found
weak
enough
or
strong
enough
to
believe
in
the
mysteries
of
magic
and
in
the
power
of
demons
for
myself
until
i
am
better
informed
i
regard
as
possible
the
apparitions
which
cardan
and
other
thaumaturgists
these
words
said
with
indescribable
eloquence
of
tone
were
of
a
nature
to
rouse
the
curiosity
of
all
present
we
looked
at
the
speaker
and
kept
silence
our
eyes
alone
betrayed
our
interest
their
pupils
reflecting
the
light
of
the
in
the
sconces
by
dint
of
observing
this
unknown
little
man
i
fancied
i
could
see
the
pores
of
his
skin
especially
those
of
his
forehead
emitting
an
inward
sentiment
with
which
he
was
saturated
this
man
apparently
so
cold
and
formal
seemed
to
contain
within
him
a
burning
altar
the
flames
of
which
beat
down
upon
us
i
do
not
know
he
continued
if
the
figure
evoked
followed
me
invisibly
but
no
sooner
had
my
head
touched
the
pillow
in
my
own
chamber
than
i
saw
once
more
that
grand
shade
of
catherine
rise
before
me
i
felt
myself
instinctively
in
a
luminous
sphere
and
my
eyes
fastened
upon
the
queen
with
intolerable
fixity
saw
naught
but
her
suddenly
she
bent
toward
at
these
words
the
ladies
present
made
a
unanimous
movement
of
curiosity
but
continued
the
lawyer
i
am
not
sure
that
i
ought
to
relate
what
happened
for
though
i
am
inclined
to
believe
it
was
all
a
dream
it
concerns
grave
matters
of
religion
asked
beaumarchais
if
there
is
any
impropriety
remarked
calonne
these
ladies
will
excuse
it
relates
to
the
government
replied
the
lawyer
go
on
then
said
the
minister
voltaire
diderot
and
their
fellows
have
already
begun
to
tutor
us
on
that
calonne
became
very
attentive
and
his
neighbor
madame
de
genlis
rather
anxious
the
little
provincial
still
hesitated
and
beaumarchais
said
to
him
somewhat
roughly
go
on
go
on
don
t
you
know
that
when
the
laws
allow
but
little
liberty
the
people
seek
their
freedom
in
their
morals
thus
adjured
the
small
man
told
his
tale
whether
it
was
that
certain
ideas
were
fermenting
in
my
brain
or
that
some
strange
power
impelled
me
i
said
to
her
ah
madame
you
committed
a
very
great
what
crime
she
asked
in
a
grave
voice
the
crime
for
which
the
signal
was
given
from
the
clock
of
the
palace
on
the
of
august
i
answered
she
smiled
disdainfully
and
a
few
deep
wrinkles
appeared
on
her
pallid
cheeks
you
call
that
a
crime
which
was
only
a
misfortune
she
said
the
enterprise
being
failed
the
benefit
we
expected
for
france
for
europe
for
the
catholic
church
was
lost
impossible
to
foresee
that
our
orders
were
ill
executed
we
did
not
find
as
many
montlucs
as
we
needed
posterity
will
not
hold
us
responsible
for
the
failure
of
communications
which
deprived
our
work
of
the
unity
of
movement
which
is
essential
to
all
great
strokes
of
policy
that
was
our
misfortune
if
on
the
of
august
not
the
shadow
of
a
huguenot
had
been
left
in
france
i
should
go
down
to
the
uttermost
posterity
as
a
noble
image
of
providence
how
many
many
times
have
the
souls
of
sixtus
the
fifth
richelieu
bossuet
reproached
me
secretly
for
having
failed
in
that
enterprise
after
having
the
boldness
to
conceive
it
how
many
and
deep
regrets
for
that
failure
attended
my
deathbed
thirty
years
after
the
the
evil
it
might
have
cured
was
still
in
existence
that
failure
caused
ten
times
more
blood
to
flow
in
france
than
if
the
massacre
of
august
had
been
completed
on
the
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
in
honor
of
which
you
have
struck
medals
has
cost
more
tears
more
blood
more
money
and
killed
the
prosperity
of
france
far
more
than
three
letellier
with
his
pen
gave
effect
to
a
decree
which
the
throne
had
secretly
promulgated
since
my
time
but
though
the
vast
execution
was
necessary
of
the
of
august
on
the
of
august
it
was
useless
under
the
second
son
of
henri
de
valois
heresy
had
scarcely
conceived
an
offspring
under
the
second
son
of
henri
de
bourbon
that
teeming
mother
had
cast
her
spawn
over
the
whole
universe
you
accuse
me
of
a
crime
and
you
put
up
statues
to
the
son
of
anne
of
austria
nevertheless
he
and
i
attempted
the
same
thing
he
succeeded
i
failed
but
louis
xiv
found
the
protestants
without
arms
whereas
in
my
reign
they
had
powerful
armies
statesmen
warriors
and
all
germany
on
their
at
these
words
slowly
uttered
i
felt
an
inward
shudder
pass
through
me
i
fancied
i
breathed
the
fumes
of
blood
from
i
know
not
what
great
mass
of
victims
catherine
was
magnified
she
stood
before
me
like
an
evil
genius
she
sought
it
seemed
to
me
to
enter
my
consciousness
and
abide
he
dreamed
all
that
whispered
beaumarchais
he
certainly
never
invented
my
reason
is
bewildered
i
said
to
the
queen
you
praise
yourself
for
an
act
which
three
generations
of
men
have
condemned
stigmatized
and
add
she
rejoined
that
historians
have
been
more
unjust
toward
me
than
my
contemporaries
none
have
defended
me
i
rich
and
am
accused
of
ambition
i
am
taxed
with
cruelty
i
who
have
but
two
deaths
upon
my
conscience
even
to
impartial
minds
i
am
still
a
problem
do
you
believe
that
i
was
actuated
by
hatred
that
vengeance
and
fury
were
the
breath
of
my
nostrils
she
smiled
with
pity
no
she
continued
i
was
cold
and
calm
as
reason
itself
i
condemned
the
huguenots
without
pity
but
without
passion
they
were
the
rotten
fruit
in
my
basket
and
i
cast
them
out
had
i
been
queen
of
england
i
should
have
treated
seditious
catholics
in
the
same
way
the
life
of
our
power
in
those
days
depended
on
their
being
but
one
god
one
faith
one
master
in
the
state
happily
for
me
i
uttered
my
justification
in
one
sentence
which
history
is
transmitting
when
birago
falsely
announced
to
me
the
loss
of
the
battle
of
dreux
i
answered
well
then
we
will
go
to
the
protestant
did
i
hate
the
reformers
no
i
esteemed
them
much
and
i
knew
them
little
if
i
felt
any
aversion
to
the
politicians
of
my
time
it
was
to
that
base
cardinal
de
lorraine
and
to
his
brother
the
shrewd
and
brutal
soldier
who
spied
upon
my
every
act
they
were
the
real
enemies
of
my
children
they
sought
to
snatch
the
crown
i
saw
them
daily
at
work
and
they
wore
me
out
if
had
not
ordered
the
the
guises
would
have
done
the
same
thing
by
the
help
of
rome
and
the
monks
the
league
which
was
powerful
only
in
consequence
of
my
old
age
would
have
begun
in
but
madame
instead
of
ordering
that
horrible
murder
pardon
my
plainness
why
not
have
employed
the
vast
resources
of
your
political
power
in
giving
to
the
reformers
those
wise
institutions
which
made
the
reign
of
henri
iv
so
glorious
and
so
peaceful
she
smiled
again
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
the
hollow
wrinkles
of
her
pallid
face
giving
her
an
expression
of
the
bitterest
sarcasm
the
peoples
she
said
need
periods
of
rest
after
savage
feuds
there
lies
the
secret
of
that
reign
but
henri
iv
committed
two
irreparable
blunders
he
ought
neither
to
have
abjured
protestantism
nor
after
becoming
a
catholic
himself
should
he
have
left
france
catholic
he
alone
was
in
a
position
to
have
changed
the
whole
of
france
without
a
jar
either
not
a
stole
or
not
a
conventicle
that
should
have
been
his
motto
to
leave
two
bitter
enemies
two
antagonistic
principles
in
a
government
with
nothing
to
balance
them
that
is
the
crime
of
kings
it
is
thus
that
they
sow
revolutions
to
god
alone
belongs
the
right
to
keep
good
and
evil
perpetually
together
in
his
work
but
it
may
be
she
said
reflectively
that
that
sentence
was
inscribed
on
the
foundation
of
henri
s
policy
and
it
may
have
caused
his
death
it
is
impossible
that
sully
did
not
cast
covetous
eyes
on
the
vast
wealth
of
the
clergy
which
the
clergy
did
not
possess
in
peace
for
the
nobles
robbed
them
of
at
least
of
their
revenue
sully
the
reformer
himself
owned
she
paused
and
appeared
to
reflect
but
she
resumed
remember
you
are
asking
the
niece
of
a
pope
to
justify
her
she
stopped
again
and
yet
after
all
she
added
with
a
gesture
of
some
levity
i
should
have
made
a
good
calvinist
do
the
wise
men
of
your
century
still
think
that
religion
had
anything
to
do
with
that
struggle
the
greatest
which
europe
has
ever
seen
a
vast
revolution
retarded
by
little
causes
which
however
will
not
be
prevented
from
overwhelming
the
world
because
i
failed
to
smother
it
a
revolution
she
said
giving
me
a
solemn
look
which
is
still
advancing
and
which
you
might
consummate
yes
who
hear
me
i
shuddered
what
has
no
one
yet
understood
that
the
old
interests
and
the
new
interests
seized
rome
and
luther
as
mere
banners
what
do
they
not
know
louis
to
escape
just
such
a
struggle
dragged
a
population
a
hundredfold
more
in
number
than
i
destroyed
from
their
homes
and
left
their
bones
on
the
sands
of
egypt
for
which
he
was
made
a
saint
while
i
but
i
she
added
she
bowed
her
head
and
was
silent
for
some
moments
i
no
longer
beheld
a
queen
but
rather
one
of
those
ancient
druidesses
to
whom
human
lives
are
sacrificed
who
unroll
the
pages
of
the
future
and
exhume
the
teachings
of
the
past
but
soon
she
uplifted
her
regal
and
majestic
form
luther
and
calvin
she
said
by
calling
the
attention
of
the
burghers
to
the
abuses
of
the
roman
church
gave
birth
in
europe
to
a
spirit
of
investigation
which
was
certain
to
lead
the
peoples
to
examine
all
things
examination
leads
to
doubt
instead
of
faith
which
is
necessary
to
all
societies
those
two
men
drew
after
them
in
the
far
distance
a
strange
philosophy
armed
with
hammers
hungry
for
destruction
science
sprang
sparkling
with
her
specious
lights
from
the
bosom
of
heresy
it
was
far
less
a
question
of
reforming
a
church
than
of
winning
indefinite
liberty
for
man
which
is
the
death
of
power
i
saw
that
the
consequence
of
the
successes
won
by
the
religionists
in
their
struggle
against
the
priesthood
already
better
armed
and
more
formidable
than
the
crown
was
the
destruction
of
the
monarchical
power
raised
by
louis
ix
at
such
vast
cost
upon
the
ruins
of
feudality
it
involved
in
fact
nothing
less
than
the
annihilation
of
religion
and
royalty
on
the
ruins
of
which
the
whole
burgher
class
of
europe
meant
to
stand
the
struggle
was
therefore
war
without
quarter
between
the
new
ideas
and
the
law
that
is
the
old
beliefs
the
catholics
were
the
emblem
of
the
material
interests
of
royalty
of
the
great
lords
and
of
the
clergy
it
was
a
duel
to
the
death
between
two
giants
unfortunately
the
proved
to
be
only
a
wound
remember
this
because
a
few
drops
of
blood
were
spared
at
that
opportune
moment
torrents
were
compelled
to
flow
at
a
later
period
the
intellect
which
soars
above
a
nation
can
not
escape
a
great
misfortune
i
mean
the
misfortune
of
finding
no
equals
capable
of
judging
it
when
it
succumbs
beneath
the
weight
of
untoward
events
my
equals
are
few
fools
are
in
the
majority
that
statement
explains
it
all
if
my
name
is
execrated
in
france
the
fault
lies
with
the
commonplace
minds
who
form
the
mass
of
all
generations
in
the
great
crises
through
which
i
passed
the
duty
of
reigning
was
not
the
mere
giving
of
audiences
reviewing
of
troops
signing
of
decrees
i
may
have
committed
mistakes
for
i
was
but
a
woman
but
why
was
there
then
no
man
who
rose
above
his
age
the
duke
of
alba
had
a
soul
of
iron
philip
ii
was
stupefied
by
catholic
belief
henri

was
a
gambling
soldier
and
a
libertine
the
admiral
a
stubborn
mule
louis
xi
lived
too
soon
richelieu
too
late
virtuous
or
criminal
guilty
or
not
in
the
i
accept
the
onus
of
it
i
stand
between
those
two
great
men
the
visible
link
of
an
unseen
chain
the
day
will
come
when
some
paradoxical
writer
will
ask
if
the
peoples
have
not
bestowed
the
title
of
executioner
among
their
victims
it
will
not
be
the
first
time
that
humanity
has
preferred
to
immolate
a
god
rather
than
admit
its
own
guilt
you
are
shedding
upon
two
hundred
clowns
sacrificed
for
a
purpose
the
tears
you
refuse
to
a
generation
a
century
a
world
you
forget
that
political
liberty
the
tranquillity
of
a
nation
nay
knowledge
itself
are
gifts
on
which
destiny
has
laid
a
tax
of
blood
but
i
exclaimed
with
tears
in
my
eyes
will
the
nations
never
be
happy
at
less
cost
truth
never
leaves
her
well
but
to
bathe
in
the
blood
which
refreshes
her
she
replied
christianity
itself
the
essence
of
all
truth
since
it
comes
from
god
was
fed
by
the
blood
of
martyrs
which
flowed
in
torrents
and
shall
it
not
ever
flow
you
will
learn
this
you
who
are
destined
to
be
one
of
the
builders
of
the
social
edifice
founded
by
the
apostles
so
long
as
you
level
heads
you
will
be
applauded
but
take
your
trowel
in
hand
begin
to
reconstruct
and
your
fellows
will
kill
blood
blood
the
word
sounded
in
my
ears
like
a
knell
according
to
you
i
cried
protestantism
has
the
right
to
reason
as
you
do
but
catherine
had
disappeared
as
if
some
puff
of
air
had
suddenly
extinguished
the
supernatural
light
which
enabled
my
mind
to
see
that
figure
whose
proportions
had
gradually
become
gigantic
and
then
without
warning
i
found
within
me
a
portion
of
myself
which
adopted
the
monstrous
doctrine
delivered
by
the
italian
i
woke
weeping
bathed
in
sweat
at
the
moment
when
my
reason
told
me
firmly
in
a
gentle
voice
that
neither
kings
nor
nations
had
the
right
to
apply
such
principles
fit
only
for
a
world
of
how
would
you
save
a
falling
monarchy
asked
beaumarchais
god
is
present
replied
the
little
lawyer
therefore
remarked
monsieur
de
calonne
with
the
inconceivable
levity
which
characterized
him
we
have
the
agreeable
resource
of
believing
ourselves
the
instruments
of
god
according
to
the
gospel
of
as
soon
as
the
ladies
discovered
that
the
tale
related
only
to
a
conversation
between
the
queen
and
the
lawyer
they
had
begun
to
whisper
and
to
show
signs
of
impatience
interjecting
now
and
then
little
phrases
through
his
speech
how
wearisome
he
is
my
dear
when
will
he
finish
were
among
those
which
reached
my
ear
when
the
strange
little
man
had
ceased
speaking
the
ladies
too
were
silent
monsieur
bodard
was
sound
asleep
the
surgeon
half
drunk
monsieur
de
calonne
was
smiling
at
the
lady
next
him
lavoisier
beaumarchais
and
i
alone
had
listened
to
the
lawyer
s
dream
the
silence
at
this
moment
had
something
solemn
about
it
the
gleam
of
the
candles
seemed
to
me
magical
a
sentiment
bound
all
three
of
us
by
some
mysterious
tie
to
that
singular
little
man
who
made
me
strange
to
say
conceive
suddenly
the
inexplicable
influences
of
fanaticism
nothing
less
than
the
hollow
cavernous
voice
of
beaumarchais
s
neighbor
the
surgeon
could
i
think
have
roused
me
i
too
have
dreamed
he
said
i
looked
at
him
more
attentively
and
a
feeling
of
some
strange
horror
came
over
me
his
livid
skin
his
features
huge
and
yet
ignoble
gave
an
exact
idea
of
what
you
must
allow
me
to
call
the
of
the
earth
a
few
spots
were
scattered
over
his
face
like
bits
of
mud
and
his
eyes
shot
forth
an
evil
gleam
the
face
seemed
perhaps
darker
more
lowering
than
it
was
because
of
the
white
hair
piled
like
hoarfrost
on
his
head
that
man
must
have
buried
many
a
patient
i
whispered
to
my
neighbor
the
lawyer
i
wouldn
t
trust
him
with
my
dog
he
answered
i
hate
him
for
my
part
i
despise
perhaps
we
are
unjust
i
remarked
ha
he
may
be
as
famous
as
volange
the
monsieur
de
calonne
here
motioned
us
to
look
at
the
surgeon
with
a
gesture
that
seemed
to
say
i
think
he
ll
be
very
did
you
dream
of
a
queen
asked
beaumarchais
no
i
dreamed
of
a
people
replied
the
surgeon
with
an
emphasis
which
made
us
laugh
i
was
then
in
charge
of
a
patient
whose
leg
i
was
to
amputate
the
next
day
did
you
find
the
people
in
the
leg
of
your
patient
asked
monsieur
de
calonne
precisely
replied
the
surgeon
how
amusing
cried
madame
de
genlis
i
was
somewhat
surprised
went
on
the
speaker
without
noticing
the
interruption
and
sticking
his
hands
into
the
gussets
of
his
breeches
to
hear
something
talking
to
me
within
that
leg
i
then
found
i
had
the
singular
faculty
of
entering
the
being
of
my
patient
once
within
his
skin
i
saw
a
marvellous
number
of
little
creatures
which
moved
and
thought
and
reasoned
some
of
them
lived
in
the
body
of
the
man
others
lived
in
his
mind
his
ideas
were
things
which
were
born
and
grew
and
died
they
were
sick
and
well
and
gay
and
sad
they
all
had
special
countenances
they
fought
with
each
other
or
they
embraced
each
other
some
ideas
sprang
forth
and
went
to
live
in
the
world
of
intellect
i
began
to
see
that
there
were
two
worlds
two
universes
the
visible
universe
and
the
invisible
universe
that
the
earth
had
like
man
a
body
and
a
soul
nature
illumined
herself
for
me
i
felt
her
immensity
when
i
saw
the
oceans
of
beings
who
in
masses
and
in
species
spread
everywhere
making
one
sole
and
uniform
animated
matter
from
the
stone
of
the
earth
to
god
magnificent
vision
in
short
i
found
a
universe
within
my
patient
when
i
inserted
my
knife
into
his
gangrened
leg
i
cut
into
a
million
of
those
little
beings
oh
you
laugh
madame
let
me
tell
you
that
you
are
eaten
up
by
such
creatures
no
personalities
interposed
monsieur
de
calonne
speak
for
yourself
and
for
your
my
patient
frightened
by
the
cries
of
his
animalcules
wanted
to
stop
the
operation
but
i
went
on
regardless
of
his
remonstrances
telling
him
that
those
evil
animals
were
already
gnawing
at
his
bones
he
made
a
sudden
movement
of
resistance
not
understanding
that
what
i
did
was
for
his
good
and
my
knife
slipped
aside
entered
my
own
body
and
he
is
stupid
said
lavoisier
no
he
is
drunk
replied
beaumarchais
but
gentlemen
my
dream
has
a
meaning
cried
the
surgeon
oh
oh
exclaimed
bodard
waking
up
my
leg
is
asleep
your
animalcules
must
be
dead
said
his
wife
that
man
has
a
vocation
announced
my
little
neighbor
who
had
stared
imperturbably
at
the
surgeon
while
he
was
speaking
it
is
to
yours
said
the
ugly
man
what
the
action
is
to
the
word
the
body
to
the
but
his
tongue
grew
thick
his
words
were
indistinct
and
he
said
no
more
fortunately
for
us
the
conversation
took
another
turn
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
we
had
forgotten
the
surgeon
of
the
king
s
pages
who
was
fast
asleep
rain
was
falling
in
torrents
as
we
left
the
the
lawyer
is
no
fool
i
said
to
beaumarchais
true
but
he
is
cold
and
dull
you
see
however
that
the
provinces
are
still
sending
us
worthy
men
who
take
a
serious
view
of
political
theories
and
the
history
of
france
it
is
a
leaven
which
will
is
your
carriage
here
asked
madame
de
addressing
me
no
i
replied
i
did
not
think
that
i
should
need
it
madame
de
then
rang
the
bell
ordered
her
own
carriage
to
be
brought
round
and
said
to
the
little
lawyer
in
a
low
voice
monsieur
de
robespierre
will
you
do
me
the
kindness
to
drop
monsieur
marat
at
his
own
door
for
he
is
not
in
a
state
to
go
with
pleasure
madame
replied
monsieur
de
robespierre
with
his
finical
gallantry
i
only
wish
you
had
requested
me
to
do
something
more
difficult
