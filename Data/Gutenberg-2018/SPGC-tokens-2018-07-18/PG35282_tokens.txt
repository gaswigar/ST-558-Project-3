i
jena
dear
roger
this
is
only
to
tell
you
that
i
love
you
supposing
you
should
have
forgotten
it
by
the
time
you
get
to
london
the
letter
will
follow
you
by
the
train
after
the
one
you
left
by
and
you
will
have
it
with
your
breakfast
the
day
after
then
you
will
be
eating
the
marmalade
jena
could
not
produce
and
you
say
a
very
indiscreet
young
woman
to
write
first
but
look
at
the
dear
roger
and
you
see
i
not
so
indiscreet
after
all
what
could
be
more
sober
and
you
no
idea
of
all
the
nice
things
i
could
have
put
instead
of
that
only
i
would
it
is
a
most
extraordinary
thing
that
this
time
yesterday
we
were
on
the
footing
you
in
your
beautiful
new
german
carefully
calling
me
at
every
second
breath
and
i
making
appropriate
answers
to
the
anstruther
who
in
one
bewildering
hour
turned
for
me
into
dear
roger
did
you
always
like
me
so
much
i
mean
love
me
so
much
my
spirit
is
rather
unbendable
as
yet
to
the
softnesses
of
these
strange
words
stiff
for
want
of
use
so
forgive
a
tendency
to
go
round
them
do
you
think
it
is
very
wonderful
that
you
should
have
been
here
a
whole
year
living
with
us
seeing
me
every
day
practising
your
german
on
me
oh
was
i
patient
and
never
have
shown
the
least
sign
that
i
could
see
of
thinking
of
me
or
of
caring
for
me
at
all
except
as
a
dim
sort
of
young
lady
who
assisted
her
in
the
work
of
properly
mending
and
feeding
you
and
then
an
hour
ago
just
one
hour
by
that
absurd
here
in
this
room
where
we
said
you
suddenly
turned
into
something
marvellous
splendid
well
into
dear
roger
it
is
so
funny
that
i
been
laughing
and
so
sweet
that
i
been
crying
i
so
happy
that
i
ca
help
writing
though
i
do
think
it
rather
gushing
loathsome
word
to
write
first
but
then
you
strictly
charged
me
not
to
tell
a
soul
yet
and
how
can
i
keep
altogether
quiet
you
then
my
poor
roger
must
be
the
one
to
listen
do
you
know
what
jena
looks
like
it
is
the
most
dazzling
place
in
the
world
radiant
with
promise
shining
and
dancing
with
all
sorts
of
little
lovely
lights
that
i
know
are
only
the
lamps
being
lit
in
people
rooms
down
the
street
but
that
look
to
me
extraordinarily
like
stars
of
hope
come
out
in
defiance
of
nature
and
fog
to
give
me
a
glorious
welcome
you
see
i
new
and
they
know
it
i
not
the
they
twinkled
down
on
from
the
day
i
was
born
till
she
was
a
dull
person
a
mere
ordinary
dull
person
climbing
doggedly
up
the
rows
of
hours
each
day
set
before
her
doggedly
doing
certain
things
she
was
told
were
her
daily
duties
equally
doggedly
circumventing
certain
others
and
actually
supposing
she
was
happy
happy
she
was
not
she
was
most
wretched
she
was
blind
and
deaf
she
was
asleep
she
was
only
half
a
woman
what
is
the
good
or
the
beauty
of
anything
alive
or
dead
in
the
world
that
has
not
fulfilled
its
destiny
and
i
never
saw
that
before
i
never
saw
a
great
many
things
before
i
am
amazed
at
the
suddenness
of
my
awaking
love
passed
through
this
house
today
this
house
that
other
people
think
is
just
the
same
dull
place
it
was
yesterday
and
behold
well
i
wo
grow
magnificent
and
it
is
what
you
do
if
you
begin
a
sentence
with
behold
but
really
there
a
splendor
oh
well
and
as
for
this
room
where
you
where
i
where
we
well
i
wo
grow
sentimental
either
though
now
i
know
i
who
always
scoffed
at
it
how
fatally
easy
a
thing
it
is
to
be
that
is
supposing
one
has
had
great
provocation
and
have
i
oh
have
i
i
had
got
as
far
as
that
when
your
beloved
professor
martens
came
in
very
much
agitated
because
he
had
missed
you
at
the
station
where
he
had
been
to
give
you
a
and
what
do
you
think
he
said
he
said
why
did
i
sit
in
this
dreary
hole
without
a
lamp
and
why
did
i
draw
the
curtains
and
shut
out
the
fog
and
drizzle
fog
and
drizzle
it
really
seemed
too
funny
why
the
whole
sky
is
shining
and
as
for
the
dreary
hole
gracious
heavens
is
it
possible
that
just
being
old
made
him
not
able
to
feel
how
the
air
of
the
room
was
still
quivering
with
all
you
said
to
me
with
all
the
sweet
wonderful
precious
things
you
said
to
me
the
place
was
full
of
you
and
there
was
your
darling
still
where
you
had
put
it
down
and
the
very
rug
we
stood
on
still
all
ruffled
up
think
it
a
glorious
hole
i
could
help
saying
said
he
indulgently
and
he
stretched
himself
in
the
the
one
you
used
to
sit
in
and
said
he
should
miss
young
anstruther
you
said
i
said
he
solemnly
was
a
most
intelligent
young
man
quite
the
most
intelligent
young
man
i
have
ever
had
here
said
i
smiling
all
over
my
silly
face
and
so
of
course
you
were
or
how
would
you
ever
have
found
out
that
i
well
that
i
not
wholly
unlovable
yours
quite
quite
truly
ii
jena
dear
roger
you
left
on
tuesday
night
that
yesterday
and
you
get
to
london
on
thursday
morning
that
and
first
you
want
to
wash
yourself
and
have
breakfast
please
notice
my
extreme
reasonableness
and
it
will
be
about
eleven
before
you
are
able
to
begin
to
write
to
me
i
sha
get
the
letter
till
saturday
and
today
is
only
wednesday
so
how
can
i
stop
myself
from
writing
to
you
again
i
should
like
to
know
i
simply
ca
besides
i
want
to
tell
you
all
the
heaps
of
important
things
i
would
have
told
you
yesterday
if
there
had
been
time
when
you
asked
me
in
that
amazing
sudden
way
if
i
marry
you
do
you
know
i
poor
of
course
you
do
you
could
have
lived
with
us
a
year
and
not
seen
by
the
very
sort
of
puddings
we
have
that
we
are
poor
do
you
think
that
anybody
who
can
help
it
would
have
three
times
a
week
and
then
if
we
were
not
my
would
never
bother
to
take
in
english
young
men
who
want
to
study
german
she
would
do
quite
different
sorts
of
things
and
we
should
have
different
sorts
of
puddings
proud
ones
with
on
their
tops
and
two
servants
instead
of
one
and
i
would
never
have
met
you
well
you
know
then
that
we
are
poor
but
i
do
believe
you
know
poor
when
girls
here
marry
their
parents
give
them
as
a
enough
to
last
them
all
their
lives
furniture
enough
to
furnish
all
their
house
clothes
enough
for
several
generations
and
so
much
a
year
besides
then
greatly
impoverished
they
spend
the
evenings
of
their
days
doing
without
things
and
congratulating
themselves
on
having
married
off
their
daughter
the
man
need
give
only
himself
you
heard
that
my
own
mother
who
died
ten
years
ago
was
english
yes
i
remember
i
told
you
that
when
you
were
so
much
surprised
at
what
you
called
in
politest
german
my
colossally
good
english
from
her
i
know
that
people
in
england
do
not
buy
their
carpets
and
saucepans
but
confine
their
helpfulness
to
suggesting
maple
it
is
the
husband
they
think
who
should
like
the
storks
of
the
fatherland
prepare
and
beautify
the
nest
for
the
wife
if
the
girl
has
money
so
much
the
better
but
if
she
has
not
said
my
mother
it
does
put
an
absolute
stop
to
her
marrying
here
it
does
and
i
belong
here
my
mother
had
some
money
or
my
father
would
never
have
let
himself
fall
in
love
with
her
i
believe
you
can
nip
these
things
in
the
bud
if
you
see
the
bud
in
time
and
you
know
my
father
is
not
a
mercenary
man
he
only
like
the
rest
of
us
could
not
get
away
altogether
from
his
and
the
points
of
view
he
had
been
made
to
stare
from
ever
since
he
stared
at
all
it
was
a
hundred
a
year
pounds
thank
heaven
not
marks
and
it
is
all
we
have
except
what
he
gets
for
his
books
when
he
does
get
anything
which
is
never
and
what
my
has
which
is
an
annuity
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
so
the
hundred
a
year
will
be
the
whole
sum
of
my
riches
for
i
have
no
aunts
what
i
want
you
to
consider
is
the
awfulness
of
marrying
a
woman
absolutely
without
saucepans
not
a
single
towel
will
she
be
able
to
add
to
your
not
a
single
pot
to
your
kitchen
all
jena
when
it
hears
of
it
will
say
infatuated
young
man
and
if
i
had
sisters
all
england
would
refuse
in
future
to
send
its
sons
to
my
why
if
you
were
making
a
decently
suitable
marriage
do
you
suppose
your
would
have
to
leave
off
writing
to
you
at
this
point
in
the
very
middle
of
luminous
prophecy
and
hurry
into
the
kitchen
and
immerse
herself
in
the
preparation
of
potato
soup
yet
that
is
exactly
what
your
who
has
caught
sight
of
the
clock
is
about
to
do
so
your
poor
but
infinitely
honest
see
how
wise
and
practical
i
am
today
i
believe
my
letter
last
night
was
rather
aflame
now
comes
morning
with
its
pails
of
cold
water
and
drenches
me
back
into
discretion
thank
god
say
i
for
mornings
iii
jena
dear
roger
i
ca
leave
you
alone
you
see
i
must
write
but
though
i
must
write
you
need
not
read
last
night
i
was
seized
with
misgivings
awful
things
for
a
hitherto
placid
fräulein
to
be
seized
with
and
i
wrestled
with
them
all
night
and
they
won
so
now
in
the
calm
frostiness
of
the
early
morning
atmosphere
i
wish
to
inquire
very
seriously
very
soberly
whether
you
have
not
made
a
mistake
in
one
sense
of
course
you
have
it
is
absurd
from
a
wordly
point
of
view
for
you
to
marry
me
but
i
mean
more
than
that
i
mean
have
you
not
mistaken
your
own
feelings
been
hurled
into
the
engagement
by
impulsiveness
by
if
you
choose
some
spell
i
may
unconsciously
have
put
upon
you
if
you
have
even
quite
a
faint
misgiving
about
what
you
really
feel
for
me
tell
me
oh
tell
me
straight
and
plainly
and
we
will
both
rub
out
that
one
weak
hour
with
a
sponge
well
soaked
in
common
sense
it
would
not
hurt
so
much
i
think
now
as
it
might
later
on
up
to
last
night
since
you
left
i
been
walking
on
air
it
is
a
most
pleasant
form
of
exercise
as
perhaps
you
know
you
not
only
walk
on
air
but
you
walk
in
what
seems
to
be
an
arrested
sunset
a
bath
of
liquid
gold
breathing
it
touching
it
wrapped
in
it
it
really
is
most
pleasant
well
i
did
that
till
last
night
then
came
my
and
catching
at
my
flying
feet
pulled
them
down
till
they
got
to
the
painted
deal
floors
of
rauchgasse
jena
and
once
having
got
there
stuck
there
observe
i
speak
in
images
my
so
respectable
so
solidly
christian
would
not
dream
of
catching
hold
of
anybody
feet
and
spoiling
their
little
bit
of
happiness
quite
unconsciously
she
blew
on
that
glow
of
sunset
in
which
i
was
flying
and
it
went
out
with
the
promptness
and
completeness
of
a
tallow
candle
and
down
came
with
a
thud
yes
i
did
come
down
with
a
thud
you
will
never
be
able
to
pretend
however
much
you
try
that
i
one
of
your
fairy
little
women
that
can
be
lifted
about
and
dandled
and
sugared
with
dainty
diminutives
will
you
facts
are
things
that
are
best
faced
i
stand
five
feet
ten
without
my
heels
and
when
i
fall
i
do
it
with
a
thud
said
my
then
after
supper
when
johanna
had
cleared
the
last
plate
away
and
we
were
sitting
alone
my
father
is
not
back
yet
from
weimar
she
on
one
side
of
the
table
i
on
the
other
the
lamp
in
the
middle
your
chair
gaping
empty
she
poor
herself
knitting
wool
into
warmth
for
the
yet
poorer
at
christmas
i
mending
the
towels
you
helped
to
wear
out
while
my
spirit
soared
and
made
a
joyful
noise
somewhere
far
away
up
among
angels
and
and
other
happy
beings
said
my
do
you
look
so
pleased
slightly
startled
i
explained
that
i
looked
pleased
because
i
was
pleased
nothing
has
happened
said
my
examining
me
over
her
spectacles
have
been
nowhere
today
and
not
seen
any
one
and
the
dinner
was
not
at
all
good
all
that
i
pleased
i
do
need
to
go
somewhere
or
see
some
one
to
be
pleased
i
can
be
it
quite
by
myself
you
are
blessed
with
a
contented
nature
that
is
true
said
my
with
a
sigh
knitting
faster
you
remember
her
sighs
you
they
are
always
to
me
very
unaccountable
they
come
in
such
odd
places
why
should
she
sigh
because
i
have
a
contented
nature
ought
she
not
rather
to
rejoice
but
the
extremely
religious
people
i
have
known
have
all
sighed
an
immense
deal
well
i
wo
probe
into
that
now
though
i
rather
long
to
suppose
it
because
it
has
been
a
fine
day
i
said
foolishly
going
on
explaining
to
a
person
already
satisfied
my
looked
up
sharply
it
has
not
been
fine
at
all
she
said
sun
has
not
appeared
once
all
day
said
i
for
a
moment
genuinely
surprised
i
could
help
being
happy
and
i
do
believe
really
happy
people
are
ever
in
the
least
aware
that
the
sun
is
not
shining
well
i
hurried
on
not
an
italian
blue
sky
but
still
mild
and
very
sweet
and
november
always
smells
of
violets
and
that
another
thing
to
be
pleased
about
echoed
my
who
dislikes
all
talk
about
things
one
can
neither
eat
nor
warm
oneself
with
nor
read
about
in
the
bible
you
not
miss
anstruther
she
asked
getting
off
such
flabbinesses
as
quickly
as
she
could
whom
you
were
so
constantly
talking
of
course
i
jumped
but
i
said
quite
naturally
i
think
it
was
then
that
she
pulled
me
down
by
the
feet
to
earth
has
a
great
future
before
him
she
said
young
man
so
clever
so
and
so
may
rise
to
anything
martens
tells
me
he
has
the
most
brilliant
prospects
he
will
be
a
great
ornament
to
the
english
diplomatic
service
martens
says
his
father
hopes
are
all
centred
on
this
only
son
and
as
he
has
very
little
money
and
much
will
be
required
roger
she
said
it
indeed
to
marry
as
soon
as
possible
some
one
who
will
help
him
in
every
way
some
one
as
wealthy
as
she
is
i
murmured
something
suitable
i
think
a
commendation
of
the
plan
as
prudent
one
could
help
liking
roger
she
went
on
roger
do
you
like
being
rogered
and
my
only
fear
is
and
martens
fears
it
too
that
he
will
entangle
himself
with
some
undesirable
girl
then
he
is
ruined
there
would
be
no
hope
for
him
i
began
then
suffocated
a
moment
behind
a
towel
why
i
said
again
gasping
he
let
us
hope
he
will
not
i
fear
though
he
is
soft
still
he
has
steered
safely
through
a
year
often
dangerous
to
young
men
it
is
true
his
father
could
not
have
sent
him
to
a
safer
place
than
my
house
you
so
oh
roger
being
arrived
at
an
age
when
serious
and
practical
thoughts
replace
the
foolish
sentimentalness
of
earlier
years
oh
roger
and
not
a
single
one
of
my
foolish
sentimentalnesses
has
been
replaced
by
anything
at
all
do
you
think
there
is
hope
for
me
do
you
think
it
is
very
bad
to
feel
exactly
the
same
just
exactly
as
now
as
i
did
at
fifteen
that
under
my
roof
went
on
my
has
been
perfectly
safe
it
would
have
been
truly
deplorable
if
his
year
in
germany
had
saddled
him
with
a
german
wife
from
a
circle
beneath
his
own
a
girl
who
had
caught
his
passing
fancy
by
youth
and
prettiness
and
who
would
have
spent
the
rest
of
her
life
dragging
him
down
an
punishment
with
a
faded
face
she
is
eloquent
is
she
eloquent
with
the
directness
that
instinctively
finds
out
one
weak
spots
and
aims
straight
at
them
she
concluded
are
no
pretty
faces
in
jena
just
now
then
i
held
a
towel
up
before
my
own
before
my
ignominious
face
excluded
by
a
most
excellent
critic
from
the
category
pretty
and
felt
as
though
i
would
hide
it
for
ever
in
stacks
of
mending
in
tubs
of
soup
in
everything
domestic
and
drudging
and
appropriate
but
some
of
the
words
you
rained
down
on
me
on
tuesday
night
between
all
those
kisses
came
throbbing
through
my
head
throbbing
with
great
throbs
through
my
whole
body
roger
did
i
hear
wrong
or
were
they
not
lovely
lovely
and
always
kisses
between
and
always
again
that
lovely
lovely
where
am
i
getting
to
perhaps
i
had
better
stop
iv
jena
dearest
of
living
creatures
the
joy
your
dear
dear
letters
gave
me
you
should
have
seen
me
seize
the
postman
his
very
fingers
seemed
as
he
gave
me
the
precious
things
two
of
them
two
all
at
once
i
could
hardly
bear
to
open
them
and
put
an
end
to
the
wonderful
moment
the
first
one
from
frankfurt
was
so
sweet
oh
so
unutterably
sweet
that
i
did
sit
gloating
over
the
unbroken
envelope
of
the
other
for
at
least
five
minutes
luxuriating
purring
i
found
out
exactly
where
your
hand
must
have
been
by
the
simple
process
of
getting
a
pen
and
pretending
to
write
the
address
where
you
had
written
it
and
then
spent
another
five
minutes
most
profitably
kissing
the
place
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
tell
you
this
but
there
shall
be
no
maidenly
simperings
between
you
and
me
no
pretences
no
affectations
if
it
was
silly
to
kiss
that
blessed
envelope
and
silly
to
tell
you
that
i
did
why
then
i
was
silly
and
there
an
end
of
it
do
you
know
that
my
mother
maiden
name
was
watson
well
it
was
i
feel
bound
to
tell
you
this
for
it
seems
to
add
to
my
ineligibleness
and
my
duty
plainly
is
to
take
you
all
round
that
and
expatiate
on
it
from
every
point
of
view
what
has
the
grandson
of
lord
grasmere
you
never
told
me
of
lord
before
by
the
way
to
do
with
the
granddaughter
of
watson
i
do
even
rightly
know
what
watson
was
he
was
always
for
me
an
obscure
and
rather
awful
figure
shrouded
in
mystery
of
course
papa
could
tell
me
about
him
but
as
he
never
has
and
my
mother
rarely
mentioned
him
i
fancy
he
was
not
anything
i
should
be
proud
of
do
not
then
require
of
me
that
i
shall
tear
the
veil
from
watson
and
of
course
your
mother
was
handsome
how
dare
you
doubt
it
look
in
the
glass
and
be
grateful
to
her
you
know
though
you
may
only
have
come
within
the
spell
of
what
you
so
sweetly
call
my
darling
brown
eyes
during
the
last
few
weeks
i
fell
a
victim
to
your
darling
blue
ones
in
the
first
five
minutes
and
how
great
was
my
joy
when
i
discovered
that
your
soul
so
exactly
matched
your
outside
your
mother
had
blue
eyes
too
and
was
very
tall
and
had
an
extraordinarily
thoughtful
face
look
i
tell
you
in
the
glass
and
you
see
she
had
for
i
refuse
to
believe
that
your
father
a
man
who
talks
port
wine
and
tomatoes
the
whole
of
the
first
meal
he
has
with
his
only
son
after
a
separation
is
the
parent
you
are
like
heavens
how
i
shake
when
i
think
of
what
will
happen
when
you
tell
him
about
me
he
say
in
a
voice
of
thunder
or
do
angry
english
parents
call
their
sons
any
more
anyhow
they
still
do
in
books
you
are
far
too
young
to
marry
young
men
of
do
not
do
such
things
the
lady
i
conclude
will
provide
the
income
roger
rushing
to
the
point
she
has
a
pfenning
incensed
parent
pfenning
sir
what
am
i
to
understand
she
a
german
roger
dreadfully
frightened
please
forcing
himself
to
be
calm
who
is
this
young
person
roger
fräulein
schmidt
of
jena
now
of
a
horrible
calmness
and
who
pray
is
fräulein
schmidt
of
jena
roger
pale
but
brave
the
daughter
of
old
schmidt
in
whose
house
i
boarded
her
mother
was
english
she
was
a
watson
sir
oblige
me
by
going
to
the
roger
goes
seriously
i
think
something
of
the
sort
will
happen
i
do
see
how
it
can
help
giving
your
father
a
dreadful
shock
and
suppose
he
gets
ill
and
his
blood
is
on
my
head
i
ca
see
how
it
is
to
be
avoided
there
is
nothing
to
recommend
me
to
him
he
know
i
poor
he
doubt
if
i
respectable
he
wo
even
think
me
pretty
you
might
tell
him
that
i
can
cook
darn
manage
as
well
as
the
thriftiest
of
and
i
believe
it
would
leave
him
cold
you
might
dwell
on
my
riper
age
as
an
advantage
say
i
have
lived
down
the
first
fevers
of
youth
i
never
had
them
say
if
he
objects
to
it
that
eve
was
as
old
as
adam
when
they
started
life
in
their
happy
garden
and
yet
they
got
on
very
well
say
that
i
beautiful
as
an
angel
or
so
plain
that
i
am
of
necessity
sensible
and
he
only
answer
do
you
see
anything
to
be
done
i
do
but
i
too
happy
to
bother
later
i
had
to
go
and
help
get
supper
ready
johanna
had
let
the
fire
out
and
it
took
rather
ages
why
do
you
say
you
feel
like
screaming
when
you
think
of
me
wrestling
with
johanna
i
tell
you
i
so
happy
that
nothing
any
johanna
can
do
or
leave
undone
in
the
least
affects
me
i
go
about
the
house
on
tiptoe
i
am
superstitious
and
have
an
idea
that
all
sorts
of
little
envious
furies
are
lying
about
in
dusty
corners
asleep
put
to
sleep
by
you
and
that
if
i
do
move
very
delicately
i
shall
wake
them
o
freude
habe
acht
sprich
leise
dass
nicht
der
schmerz
erwacht
that
not
goethe
by
the
way
goethe
what
an
unforeseen
result
of
a
year
in
the
city
of
the
muses
half
an
hour
journey
from
the
ilm
athens
itself
that
you
should
pronounce
his
poetry
coarse
obvious
and
commonplace
what
would
papa
say
if
he
knew
probably
that
young
anstruther
is
not
the
intelligent
young
man
he
took
him
for
but
then
papa
is
soaked
in
goethe
and
the
longer
he
soaks
the
more
he
adores
him
in
this
faith
in
this
i
have
been
brought
up
and
can
not
i
afraid
get
rid
of
it
all
at
once
it
is
even
possible
that
i
never
shall
in
spite
of
london
and
you
will
you
love
me
less
if
i
do
always
i
have
thought
goethe
uninspired
the
muse
never
seized
and
shook
him
till
divinenesses
dropped
off
his
pen
without
his
knowing
how
or
whence
divinenesses
like
those
you
find
sometimes
in
the
pages
of
lesser
men
lesser
men
stamped
with
the
unmistakable
stamp
of
heavenly
birth
goethe
knew
very
well
very
exactly
where
each
of
his
sentences
had
come
from
but
i
do
see
that
his
poetry
is
either
of
the
three
things
you
say
i
it
is
not
the
last
two
for
the
world
would
grow
very
interesting
if
thinking
and
writing
as
he
did
were
so
obvious
that
we
all
did
it
as
to
its
being
coarse
incurably
incapable
of
seeing
coarseness
in
things
to
me
all
is
clean
for
ever
and
ever
everything
is
natural
and
everything
is
clean
except
for
the
person
who
is
afraid
it
is
perhaps
dear
roger
you
wo
as
papa
says
quite
apprehend
my
meaning
if
you
can
not
please
console
yourself
with
the
reflection
that
probably
i
have
got
one
what
you
say
about
the
money
you
have
dazzles
me
why
it
a
fortune
we
shall
be
richer
than
our
you
never
told
me
you
were
so
rich
five
hundred
pounds
a
year
is
ten
thousand
marks
nearly
double
what
we
have
always
lived
on
and
we
really
been
quite
comfortable
now
have
we
but
think
of
our
glory
when
my
hundred
pounds
is
added
and
we
have
an
income
of
twelve
thousand
marks
the
will
be
utterly
eclipsed
and
i
such
a
good
manager
you
see
how
we
live
you
grow
quite
fat
i
shall
give
you
lovely
food
and
papa
says
that
lovely
food
is
the
one
thing
that
ever
really
makes
a
man
give
himself
the
trouble
to
rise
up
and
call
his
wife
blessed
it
is
so
late
do
take
my
from
me
i
know
simply
masses
of
him
and
ca
let
him
go
my
mind
is
decked
out
with
him
as
a
garden
is
decked
with
flowers
now
is
that
pretty
or
is
it
only
silly
anyhow
dreadfully
late
v
jena
no
letter
from
you
today
i
am
afraid
you
are
being
worried
and
because
of
me
here
am
i
quiet
and
cheerful
nobody
bothering
me
and
your
dear
image
in
my
heart
to
warm
every
minute
of
life
there
are
you
being
forced
to
think
things
out
to
make
plans
for
the
future
decide
on
courses
of
action
besides
having
to
pass
exams
and
circumvent
a
parent
whom
i
gather
you
regard
as
refractory
how
lucky
i
am
in
my
dear
father
if
i
could
have
chosen
i
would
have
chosen
him
never
has
he
been
any
trouble
never
does
he
bore
me
never
am
i
forced
to
criticisms
he
knows
that
i
have
no
brains
and
has
forgiven
me
i
know
he
has
much
and
have
forgiven
him
we
spend
our
time
spoiling
and
petting
and
loving
each
other
do
you
remember
how
you
sometimes
laughed
but
i
wish
you
were
not
worried
it
is
all
because
i
so
ineligible
if
i
could
come
to
you
with
a
pot
of
money
in
each
hand
turned
by
an
appreciative
ruler
into
baroness
von
schmidt
with
a
papa
in
my
train
weighed
down
by
orders
and
the
road
behind
me
black
with
carts
containing
clothes
your
father
would
be
merciful
unto
us
and
bless
us
as
things
are
you
are
already
being
punished
you
have
already
begun
to
pay
the
penalty
for
that
one
little
hour
happiness
and
it
wo
be
quite
paid
ever
not
so
long
as
we
both
shall
live
do
you
who
think
so
much
ever
think
of
the
almost
indecent
haste
with
which
punishments
hurry
in
the
wake
of
joys
they
really
seem
to
tumble
over
one
another
in
their
eagerness
each
to
get
there
first
you
took
me
to
your
heart
told
me
you
loved
me
asked
me
to
be
your
wife
was
it
so
wrong
so
wrong
to
let
oneself
go
to
happiness
for
those
few
moments
that
one
should
immediately
be
punished
my
father
will
not
let
me
believe
anything
he
says
when
my
is
not
listening
when
she
is
he
does
that
belief
is
not
faith
and
you
ca
believe
if
you
do
not
know
but
he
can
not
stop
my
silently
believing
that
the
power
in
whose
clutches
we
are
is
an
amazing
disciplinarian
a
relentless
grudger
of
joys
and
what
pitiful
small
joys
they
are
after
all
pitiful
little
attempts
of
souls
doomed
to
eternal
solitude
to
put
out
feelers
in
the
dark
to
get
close
to
each
other
to
touch
each
other
to
try
to
make
each
other
warm
now
i
am
growing
lugubrious
i
who
thought
never
to
be
lugubrious
again
and
at
ten
on
a
fine
november
morning
of
all
times
in
the
world
papa
comes
back
from
weimar
today
there
has
been
a
prolonged
meeting
there
of
local
lights
about
the
damage
done
by
some
goth
to
the
shakespeare
statue
in
the
park
and
though
papa
is
not
a
light
still
he
did
burn
with
indignation
over
that
and
has
been
making
impassioned
speeches
and
suggesting
punishments
for
the
goth
when
they
shall
have
caught
him
i
think
i
shall
go
over
by
the
two
train
and
meet
him
and
bring
him
home
and
look
in
at
goethe
sponge
on
the
way
you
know
how
the
little
black
thing
lies
in
his
bedroom
there
next
to
a
basin
not
much
bigger
than
a
with
this
he
washed
and
was
satisfied
and
whenever
i
feel
depressed
out
of
countenance
with
myself
and
life
i
go
and
look
at
it
and
come
home
cheered
and
strengthened
i
wonder
if
you
be
able
to
make
out
why
bless
you
my
dearest
vi
jena
that
sponge
had
no
effect
yesterday
i
stared
and
stared
at
it
and
it
only
remained
a
sponge
far
too
small
for
the
really
cleanly
instead
of
what
it
has
up
to
now
been
the
for
a
train
of
thrilling
enthusiastic
thoughts
i
an
unbalanced
creature
do
you
divide
your
time
too
i
wonder
between
knocking
your
head
against
the
stars
and
in
some
freezing
depth
of
blackness
listening
to
your
heart
how
it
will
hardly
beat
for
fear
of
course
you
do
you
are
much
too
clever
and
then
you
have
been
educated
trained
taught
to
keep
your
thoughts
within
bounds
and
not
let
them
start
off
every
minute
on
fresh
and
aimless
wanderings
yet
the
is
so
wonderful
that
i
believe
i
would
rather
freeze
the
whole
year
round
for
one
hour
of
it
than
go
back
again
to
the
changeless
calm
the
sunshine
in
which
i
used
to
sit
before
i
knew
you
all
this
only
means
that
you
have
not
written
see
how
variously
one
can
state
a
fact
i
have
run
away
from
the
and
the
round
table
and
the
lamp
because
papa
and
my
had
begun
to
discuss
you
again
your
prospects
your
probable
hideous
fate
if
you
were
not
prudent
your
glorious
career
if
you
were
i
felt
guilty
wounded
triumphant
vain
all
at
once
papa
of
course
was
chiefly
the
listener
he
agreed
or
at
most
he
temporized
i
tell
you
roger
i
am
amazed
at
the
power
a
woman
has
over
her
husband
if
she
is
in
way
inferior
to
him
it
is
not
only
that
as
we
say
klügere
giebt
it
is
the
daily
complete
victory
of
the
coarser
over
the
finer
the
rough
over
the
gentle
the
ignorant
over
the
wise
my
is
an
uneducated
person
shrewd
about
all
the
things
that
do
not
matter
unaware
of
the
very
existence
of
the
things
that
do
ready
to
be
charitable
helpful
where
the
calamity
is
big
enough
wholly
unsympathetic
even
antagonistic
toward
all
those
many
small
calamities
that
make
up
one
years
the
sort
of
woman
parsons
praise
and
who
get
tombstones
put
over
them
at
last
peppered
with
frigid
adjectives
like
virtuous
and
just
did
you
ever
chance
to
live
with
a
just
person
they
are
very
chilling
and
not
so
rare
as
one
might
suppose
and
papa
laxest
most
tolerant
of
men
so
lax
that
nothing
seems
to
him
altogether
bad
so
tolerant
that
nobody
however
hard
he
tries
can
pass
he
thinks
beyond
the
reach
of
forgiveness
and
love
so
humorous
that
he
has
to
fight
continually
to
suppress
it
for
humor
lands
one
in
odd
morasses
of
dislike
and
misconception
here
married
her
a
year
after
my
mother
died
and
did
it
wholly
for
my
sake
imagine
it
she
was
to
make
me
happy
imagine
that
too
i
was
not
any
longer
to
be
a
solitary
with
holes
in
her
stockings
and
riotous
hair
there
came
a
painful
time
when
papa
began
to
suspect
that
the
roughness
of
my
hair
might
conceivably
be
a
symbol
of
the
dishevelment
of
my
soul
neighboring
matrons
pointed
out
the
possibility
to
him
he
took
to
peering
anxiously
at
unimportant
parts
of
me
such
as
my
nails
and
was
startled
to
see
them
often
black
he
caught
me
once
or
twice
in
corners
when
it
had
happened
that
the
dear
ways
and
pretty
looks
of
my
darling
mother
had
come
back
for
a
moment
with
extra
vividness
he
decided
that
i
was
both
dirty
and
wretched
and
argued
i
am
sure
during
sleepless
nights
that
i
would
probably
go
on
being
dirty
and
wretched
for
ever
and
so
he
put
on
his
best
clothes
one
day
and
set
out
doggedly
in
search
of
a
wife
he
found
her
quite
easily
in
a
house
in
the
next
street
she
was
making
doughnuts
for
it
was
the
afternoon
of
new
year
eve
she
had
just
taken
them
out
of
the
oven
and
they
were
obviously
successful
papa
loves
doughnuts
his
dinner
had
been
uneatable
the
weather
was
cold
she
took
off
her
apron
and
piled
them
on
a
dish
and
carried
them
scattering
fragrance
as
they
went
into
the
and
the
smell
of
them
was
grateful
and
they
were
very
hot
papa
came
home
engaged
am
not
as
a
rule
in
favor
of
second
marriages
he
began
breaking
the
news
to
me
with
elaborate
art
horrid
things
i
remarked
my
arm
round
his
neck
my
face
against
his
for
even
then
i
was
as
tall
as
he
you
know
how
he
begins
abruptly
about
anything
that
happens
to
cross
his
mind
so
i
was
not
surprised
he
rubbed
his
nose
violently
never
knew
anybody
with
such
hair
as
yours
for
tickling
a
person
he
said
trying
to
push
it
back
behind
my
ears
of
course
it
would
not
go
it
do
that
he
added
suspiciously
it
were
properly
brushed
do
know
well
what
second
marriages
he
had
forgotten
and
he
started
in
an
instant
i
knew
i
took
my
arm
away
quickly
but
put
it
back
again
just
as
quickly
and
pressed
my
face
still
closer
it
was
better
we
should
not
see
each
other
eyes
while
he
told
me
am
not
as
a
rule
in
favor
of
them
he
repeated
when
he
had
coughed
and
tried
a
second
time
to
induce
my
hair
to
go
behind
my
ears
there
are
cases
where
they
are
imperative
ones
if
a
man
is
left
with
little
children
for
instance
he
engages
a
good
nurse
his
children
run
wild
he
gets
a
severe
aunt
to
live
with
him
they
grow
up
they
take
care
of
themselves
he
is
an
old
man
left
with
say
one
daughter
she
would
take
care
of
him
who
would
take
care
of
her
would
if
he
is
an
incapable
an
old
person
totally
unable
to
notice
lapses
from
convention
from
social
customs
if
no
one
is
there
to
tell
her
how
to
dress
and
how
to
behave
and
she
is
growing
up
and
yet
remains
a
barbarian
and
the
day
is
not
far
distant
when
she
must
go
out
and
he
knows
that
when
she
does
go
out
jena
will
be
astounded
the
barbarian
live
in
jena
dear
she
is
universal
wherever
there
is
a
widower
with
an
only
female
child
there
she
is
if
she
had
been
happy
she
had
not
been
happy
she
used
to
cry
of
course
she
used
to
cry
sometimes
when
she
thought
more
than
usual
of
her
sweet
of
her
sweet
but
for
all
that
she
had
been
happy
and
so
had
he
why
you
know
he
had
did
she
look
after
him
and
keep
house
for
him
did
she
cook
for
him
not
very
beautifully
perhaps
but
still
she
did
cook
and
there
was
dinner
every
day
did
she
go
to
market
three
times
a
week
and
taste
all
the
butter
did
she
help
to
do
the
rooms
and
in
the
evenings
were
they
happy
together
with
nobody
to
worry
them
and
then
when
he
missed
his
darling
wife
the
barbarian
always
know
he
was
doing
it
and
come
and
sit
on
his
knee
and
kiss
him
and
make
up
for
it
did
she
now
did
she
papa
unwound
himself
and
walked
up
and
down
with
a
desperate
face
of
sixteen
must
learn
how
to
dress
and
to
behave
a
father
can
not
show
them
that
he
said
they
do
dress
and
behave
unmended
stockings
are
not
dressing
and
to
talk
to
a
learned
stranger
well
advanced
in
years
with
the
freedom
of
his
equal
in
age
and
knowledge
as
i
saw
one
doing
lately
is
not
behaving
papa
she
would
do
that
again
i
certain
would
have
done
it
that
once
if
she
had
had
a
mother
the
poor
wretch
had
got
a
mother
a
mother
therefore
must
be
provided
here
i
remember
there
was
a
long
pause
papa
walked
and
i
watched
him
in
despair
despair
too
was
in
his
own
face
he
had
had
time
to
forget
the
doughnuts
and
how
cold
he
had
been
and
how
hungry
so
shaken
was
i
that
i
actually
suggested
the
engagement
of
a
finishing
governess
to
finish
that
which
had
never
been
begun
pointing
out
that
she
at
least
having
finished
would
go
and
he
said
he
could
not
afford
one
and
he
added
the
amazing
statement
that
a
wife
was
cheaper
well
i
suppose
she
has
been
cheap
that
is
she
has
made
one
of
marks
go
as
far
as
two
of
other
people
but
oh
how
expensive
she
has
been
in
other
ways
she
has
ruined
us
in
such
things
as
freedom
and
sweetness
and
light
you
know
the
sort
of
talk
here
at
meals
i
wish
you
could
have
heard
it
before
her
time
she
has
such
a
strong
personality
that
somehow
we
have
always
followed
her
lead
and
papa
who
used
to
bubble
out
streams
of
gayety
when
he
and
i
sat
untidily
on
either
side
of
a
tureen
of
horrible
bad
soup
who
talked
of
all
things
under
heaven
and
with
undaunted
audacity
of
many
things
in
it
and
who
somehow
put
a
snap
and
a
sparkle
into
whatever
he
said
sits
like
a
schoolboy
invited
to
a
meal
at
his
master
eager
to
agree
anxious
to
give
satisfaction
the
wax
cloth
on
the
table
is
clean
and
shiny
the
spoons
are
bright
a
cruet
with
clear
oil
and
vinegar
stands
in
the
midst
the
food
though
simple
is
hot
and
decent
we
are
quite
comfortable
and
any
of
the
other
jena
coming
in
during
a
meal
would
certainly
cry
out
but
of
what
use
is
it
to
be
whitewashed
and
trim
outside
to
have
pleasant
creepers
and
tidy
shutters
when
inside
one
soul
wanders
through
empty
rooms
mournfully
shivers
in
damp
and
darkness
is
hungry
and
no
one
brings
it
food
is
cold
and
no
one
lights
a
fire
is
miserable
and
tired
and
there
not
a
chair
to
sit
on
why
i
write
all
this
i
ca
think
except
that
i
feel
as
if
i
were
talking
to
you
you
must
tell
me
if
i
bore
you
when
i
begin
a
letter
to
you
the
great
difficulty
is
to
leave
off
again
oh
how
warm
it
makes
one
feel
to
know
that
there
is
one
person
in
the
world
to
whom
one
is
everything
a
lover
is
the
most
precious
the
most
marvellous
possession
no
wonder
people
like
having
them
and
i
used
to
think
that
so
silly
heavens
what
an
absurd
person
i
have
been
why
love
is
the
one
thing
worth
having
everything
else
talents
work
arts
religion
learning
the
whole
are
so
many
drugs
with
which
the
starved
the
loverless
try
to
dull
their
pangs
to
put
themselves
to
sleep
and
god
bless
you
a
thousand
times
vii
jena
dearest
your
letter
came
this
afternoon
how
glad
i
was
to
get
it
and
i
do
think
it
a
good
idea
to
go
down
into
the
country
to
those
americans
before
your
exam
who
knows
but
they
may
by
giving
you
peace
at
the
right
moment
be
the
means
of
making
you
pass
extra
brilliantly
that
you
should
not
pass
at
all
is
absolutely
out
of
the
question
why
have
the
gods
showered
gifts
on
you
if
not
for
the
proper
passing
of
exams
for
i
suppose
in
this
as
in
everything
else
there
are
different
ways
ways
of
excellence
and
mediocrity
i
know
which
way
yours
will
be
if
only
the
presence
of
my
spirit
by
your
side
on
saturday
could
be
of
use
but
that
the
worst
of
spirits
they
never
seem
to
be
the
least
good
unless
they
take
their
bodies
with
them
yet
mine
burns
so
hotly
when
i
am
thinking
of
you
and
when
am
i
not
thinking
of
you
that
i
feel
as
if
you
actually
must
feel
the
glow
of
it
as
it
follows
you
about
how
strange
and
dreadful
love
is
till
you
know
it
you
are
so
sure
the
world
is
very
good
and
pleasant
up
in
those
serene
regions
where
you
stand
alone
breathing
the
thin
air
of
family
affection
shone
upon
gently
by
the
mild
and
misty
sun
of
general
esteem
then
comes
love
and
pulls
you
down
for
is
it
a
descent
is
it
somehow
though
it
is
so
great
a
glory
it
a
as
well
down
from
the
pride
of
absolute
independence
of
body
and
soul
down
from
the
of
indifference
to
something
fierce
and
hot
and
consuming
oh
i
dare
tell
you
how
little
of
serenity
i
have
left
at
first
just
at
first
i
did
feel
like
this
i
think
i
was
stunned
my
soul
seemed
to
stand
still
surely
it
was
extraordinary
that
tempestuous
crossing
from
the
calm
of
careless
friendship
to
the
place
where
love
dashes
madly
against
the
rocks
do
laugh
at
my
images
in
deadly
earnest
i
do
feel
that
love
hurts
i
do
feel
as
if
i
been
thrown
on
to
rocks
left
by
myself
on
them
to
come
slowly
to
my
senses
and
find
i
am
lying
alone
in
a
new
and
burning
sun
it
an
exquisite
sort
of
pain
but
it
very
nearly
unbearable
you
see
you
are
so
far
away
and
i
i
learning
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
what
it
means
that
saying
about
eating
out
one
heart
viii
jena
really
my
dear
roger
nicest
of
all
pleasantest
best
and
certainly
most
charming
i
do
think
i
write
to
you
again
in
the
evenings
one
of
those
hard
clear
hours
that
lie
round
will
be
the
most
seemly
for
consecration
to
you
moods
are
such
queer
things
each
one
so
distinct
and
real
so
seemingly
eternal
and
i
am
influenced
by
them
to
an
extraordinary
degree
the
weather
the
time
of
day
the
light
in
the
room
yes
actually
the
light
in
the
room
sunlight
cloudlight
lamplight
the
scent
of
certain
flowers
the
sound
of
certain
voices
the
instant
my
senses
become
aware
of
either
of
these
things
i
find
myself
flung
into
the
middle
of
a
fresh
mood
and
the
worst
part
of
it
is
the
blind
enthusiasm
with
which
i
am
sure
that
as
i
think
and
feel
at
that
moment
so
will
i
think
and
feel
for
ever
nothing
cures
me
no
taking
of
myself
aside
no
weight
of
private
admonishment
no
bringing
of
my
spirit
within
the
white
glare
of
pure
reason
oh
women
are
fools
and
of
all
fools
the
most
complete
is
myself
but
that
not
what
i
want
to
talk
about
i
want
to
say
that
i
had
to
go
to
a
yesterday
at
four
which
is
why
i
put
off
answering
your
letter
of
the
till
the
evening
my
dear
roger
you
must
take
no
notice
of
that
letter
pray
think
of
me
as
a
young
person
of
sobriety
collected
discreet
cold
to
frostiness
think
of
me
like
that
my
dear
and
in
return
i
undertake
to
write
to
you
only
in
my
mood
quite
the
most
respectable
i
possess
it
is
nine
now
papa
in
the
slippers
you
ca
have
forgotten
is
in
his
corner
by
the
stove
loudly
disagreeing
with
the
morning
paper
he
keeps
on
shouting
johanna
is
carrying
coals
about
and
dropping
them
with
a
great
noise
my
is
busy
telling
her
how
wrong
it
is
to
drop
dirty
coals
in
clean
places
i
am
writing
on
a
bit
of
the
surrounded
by
crumbs
and
i
will
not
clear
them
away
till
i
finished
my
letter
because
then
i
am
sure
get
nothing
either
morbid
or
lovesick
who
i
like
to
know
could
flame
into
or
sink
into
the
mud
of
morbidness
from
a
of
anything
so
sprightly
as
crumbs
and
it
was
too
sweet
of
you
to
compare
me
to
nausicaa
in
your
letter
yesterday
nobody
ever
did
that
before
various
aunts
among
whom
a
few
years
ago
there
was
a
great
mortality
so
that
they
are
all
now
aunts
in
heaven
told
me
in
divers
tones
that
i
was
much
too
long
for
my
width
that
i
was
like
the
handle
of
a
broom
like
the
steeple
of
the
like
a
tree
walking
but
none
of
them
ever
said
anything
about
nausicaa
i
doubt
if
they
had
ever
heard
of
her
i
afraid
if
they
had
they
would
have
seen
that
i
am
like
her
you
know
the
blindness
of
aunts
jena
is
full
of
them
not
mine
sei
but
other
people
and
they
are
all
i
do
mean
of
course
that
the
jena
streets
are
thick
with
aunts
being
led
by
dogs
on
strings
but
that
they
have
that
tragic
blindness
of
the
spirit
that
misses
seeing
things
that
are
hopeful
and
generous
and
lovely
things
alight
with
young
enthusiasms
or
beautiful
with
a
patience
that
has
had
time
to
grow
gray
they
also
have
that
odd
unfurnished
sort
of
mind
that
can
never
forget
and
never
forgive
yesterday
at
the
i
met
them
all
again
the
jena
aunts
i
know
so
well
and
who
are
yet
for
ever
strange
for
ever
of
a
ghastly
freshness
it
was
the
first
this
season
and
now
i
suppose
i
shall
waste
many
a
good
afternoon
how
i
wish
i
had
not
to
go
my
says
that
if
i
do
not
show
myself
i
shall
be
put
down
as
eccentric
are
not
very
popular
says
she
it
is
do
not
therefore
make
matters
worse
then
she
appeals
should
a
more
than
usual
stubbornness
cloud
my
open
countenance
to
papa
she
says
she
not
then
do
as
others
of
her
age
and
of
course
papa
says
bless
him
that
girls
must
see
life
occasionally
and
is
quite
unhappy
if
i
wo
life
god
bless
him
for
a
dear
innocent
papa
and
how
they
talked
yesterday
papa
would
have
writhed
he
never
will
talk
or
listen
to
talk
about
women
unless
been
dead
some
time
so
uninteresting
so
unworthy
of
discussion
does
he
consider
all
live
females
except
johanna
to
be
and
if
i
had
had
my
i
took
it
with
me
tucked
inside
my
dress
where
my
heart
could
beat
against
it
i
do
think
i
would
have
survived
that
you
no
idea
how
proudly
i
set
out
had
i
just
been
reading
the
sweetest
things
about
myself
in
your
letter
of
course
i
was
proud
and
i
felt
so
important
and
so
impressive
and
simply
gloriously
the
pavement
of
jena
i
decided
as
i
walked
over
it
was
quite
unworthy
to
be
touched
by
my
feet
and
if
the
only
knew
it
an
extremely
valuable
person
was
in
their
midst
in
fact
my
dear
roger
i
fancied
myself
yesterday
did
odysseus
think
nausicaa
was
artemis
when
first
he
met
her
among
the
washing
so
did
she
appear
well
i
felt
yesterday
made
by
your
love
i
actually
fancied
people
would
something
wonderful
had
happened
to
me
that
i
was
transfigured
positively
i
had
a
momentary
feeling
that
my
coming
in
the
coming
in
of
anything
so
happy
must
blind
the
that
anything
so
burning
with
love
must
scorch
it
well
it
did
never
did
torch
plunged
into
wetness
go
out
with
a
drearier
fizzle
than
did
my
little
shining
nobody
noticed
anything
different
nobody
seemed
even
to
look
at
me
a
few
careless
hands
were
stretched
out
and
the
hostess
told
me
to
ask
the
servant
to
bring
more
milk
they
were
talking
about
sin
we
do
sin
much
in
jena
so
generally
they
talk
about
sick
people
or
their
neighbor
income
and
what
he
does
with
it
but
yesterday
they
talked
sin
you
know
because
we
are
poor
and
papa
has
no
official
position
and
i
have
come
to
be
without
having
found
a
husband
i
am
a
in
our
set
a
being
in
whose
presence
everything
can
be
said
and
who
is
expected
to
sit
in
a
draught
if
there
is
one
too
old
to
join
the
young
girls
in
the
corner
set
apart
for
them
where
they
whisper
and
giggle
and
eat
amazing
quantities
of
whipped
cream
i
hover
uneasily
on
the
outskirts
of
the
group
of
the
married
and
try
to
ingratiate
myself
by
keeping
on
handing
them
cakes
it
generally
ends
in
my
being
sent
out
every
few
minutes
by
the
hostess
to
the
kitchen
to
fetch
more
food
and
things
is
so
useful
she
will
explain
to
the
others
when
i
have
been
extra
quick
and
cheerful
but
i
do
suppose
nausicaa
female
acquaintances
said
more
the
man
ulysses
might
take
her
for
a
goddess
but
the
most
the
women
would
do
would
be
to
commend
the
way
she
did
the
washing
sometimes
i
have
great
trouble
not
to
laugh
when
i
see
their
heads
often
quite
venerable
gathered
together
in
an
eager
bunch
and
hear
them
expressing
horror
sympathy
pity
in
every
sort
of
appropriate
tone
while
their
eyes
their
eyes
betrayers
of
the
soul
look
pleased
why
they
should
be
pleased
when
somebody
has
had
an
operation
or
does
pay
his
debts
i
ca
make
out
but
they
do
and
after
a
course
of
throughout
the
winter
you
are
left
toward
april
with
one
firm
conviction
in
a
world
where
everything
else
is
shaky
that
there
not
a
single
person
who
is
either
extraordinarily
ill
or
if
he
not
who
does
not
misuse
his
health
and
strength
by
not
paying
his
servants
wages
yesterday
the
was
in
a
fearful
flutter
it
had
got
hold
of
a
tale
of
sin
real
or
suspected
it
was
a
tale
of
two
people
who
after
leading
exemplary
lives
for
years
had
suddenly
been
clutched
by
the
throat
by
nature
and
nature
we
know
cares
nothing
at
all
for
the
claims
of
husbands
and
wives
or
any
other
lawfulnesses
and
is
a
most
unmoral
and
person
they
have
says
jena
begun
to
love
each
other
in
defiance
of
the
law
nature
has
been
too
many
for
them
i
suppose
all
jena
is
nothing
can
be
proved
but
everything
is
being
feared
said
the
hostess
from
her
eyes
i
afraid
she
wanted
to
say
hoped
is
it
ugly
as
we
say
and
so
stale
if
true
why
ca
people
defy
nature
and
be
good
the
only
thing
that
is
always
fresh
and
beautiful
is
goodness
it
is
also
the
only
thing
that
can
make
you
go
on
being
happy
indefinitely
i
know
her
well
my
heart
failed
me
when
i
heard
her
being
talked
about
so
hideously
she
is
the
nicest
woman
in
jena
she
has
been
kind
to
me
often
she
is
very
clever
perhaps
if
she
had
been
more
dull
she
would
have
found
no
temptation
to
do
anything
but
jog
along
respectably
sometimes
i
think
that
to
be
without
imagination
is
to
be
so
very
safe
he
has
only
come
to
these
parts
lately
he
used
to
be
in
berlin
and
has
been
appointed
to
a
very
good
position
in
weimar
i
have
not
met
him
but
papa
says
he
is
brilliant
he
has
a
wife
and
she
has
a
husband
and
they
each
have
a
lot
of
children
so
you
see
if
it
true
it
really
is
very
just
as
the
was
on
the
wane
and
crumbs
were
being
brushed
off
laps
and
tied
in
she
walked
there
was
a
moment
dead
silence
then
you
should
have
heard
the
effusion
of
welcoming
speeches
the
hostess
ran
up
and
hugged
her
the
others
were
covered
with
pleasant
smiles
perhaps
they
were
grateful
to
her
for
having
provided
such
thrilling
talk
when
i
had
to
go
and
kiss
her
hand
i
never
in
my
life
felt
baser
you
should
have
seen
her
looking
round
cheerfully
at
all
the
judases
and
saying
she
was
sorry
to
be
late
and
asking
if
they
had
missed
her
and
you
should
have
heard
the
eager
chorus
of
assurances
oh
how
much
i
love
goodness
straightness
singleness
of
heart
later
i
walked
part
of
the
way
home
with
the
calumniated
one
how
charming
she
is
dear
little
lady
it
would
be
difficult
not
to
love
her
she
talked
delightfully
about
german
and
english
poetry
do
you
think
one
can
talk
delightfully
about
german
and
english
poetry
and
yet
be
a
sinner
tell
me
do
you
think
a
woman
who
is
very
intellectual
but
very
intellectual
could
yet
be
a
sinner
would
not
her
wits
save
her
would
not
her
bright
wits
save
her
from
anything
so
dull
as
sin
ix
jena
dearest
i
do
think
i
like
that
girl
at
all
your
letter
from
clinches
has
just
come
and
i
do
think
i
like
her
at
all
what
is
more
i
do
think
i
ever
shall
like
her
and
what
is
still
more
i
do
think
i
even
want
to
so
your
idea
of
her
being
a
good
friend
to
me
later
on
in
london
must
retire
to
that
draughty
corner
of
space
where
abortive
ideas
are
left
to
eternal
shivering
i
sorry
if
i
am
offensively
independent
but
then
i
know
so
well
that
i
wo
be
lonely
if
i
with
you
and
i
think
rooting
up
which
you
speak
of
as
a
difficult
and
probably
painful
process
must
be
very
nice
if
you
are
the
one
to
do
it
and
i
am
sure
i
could
never
by
any
possibility
reach
such
depths
of
strangeness
and
doubt
about
what
to
do
next
as
would
induce
me
to
stretch
out
appealing
hands
to
a
young
woman
with
eyes
that
as
you
put
it
tilt
at
the
corners
i
wish
you
had
told
her
about
us
about
me
it
has
profaned
things
so
dragged
them
out
into
the
streets
cheapened
them
i
do
in
the
least
want
to
tell
my
father
or
any
one
else
does
this
sound
as
though
i
were
angry
well
i
do
think
i
am
on
the
contrary
i
rather
want
to
laugh
you
dear
silly
so
clever
and
so
simple
so
wise
and
crammed
with
learning
and
such
a
dear
ineffable
goose
how
old
am
i
i
wonder
only
as
old
as
you
really
only
as
old
nonsense
i
fifteen
twenty
years
your
senior
my
dear
sir
i
lived
in
jena
you
in
london
i
frequent
and
you
the
great
world
i
talk
much
with
johanna
in
the
kitchen
and
you
with
heaven
knows
what
in
the
way
of
geniuses
yet
no
male
nancy
cheriton
were
his
eyelids
never
so
tilted
would
wring
a
word
out
of
me
about
a
thing
so
near
so
precious
so
much
soul
of
my
soul
as
my
lover
how
would
you
explain
this
i
tried
and
ca
your
rebellious
darling
darling
do
ask
me
to
like
nancy
the
thing
unthinkable
later
now
i
know
why
i
am
wiser
than
you
life
in
kitchens
and
turns
the
soul
gray
very
early
did
one
of
your
poets
sing
of
somebody
who
had
a
sad
lucidity
of
soul
i
afraid
that
is
what
the
matter
with
me
x
jena
oh
what
nonsense
everything
seems
everything
of
the
nature
of
differences
of
arguments
on
a
clear
morning
up
among
the
hills
i
am
ashamed
of
what
i
wrote
about
nancy
ashamed
of
my
eagerness
and
heat
about
a
thing
that
does
not
matter
on
the
hills
this
morning
as
i
was
walking
in
the
sunshine
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
met
god
and
he
took
me
by
the
hand
and
let
me
walk
with
him
and
he
showed
me
how
beautiful
the
world
is
how
beautiful
the
background
he
has
given
us
the
spacious
splendid
background
on
which
to
paint
our
large
charities
and
loves
and
i
looked
across
the
hilltops
golden
utterly
peaceful
and
amazement
filled
me
in
the
presence
of
that
great
calm
at
the
way
i
flutter
through
my
days
and
at
the
noise
i
make
why
should
i
cry
out
before
i
am
hurt
flare
up
into
heat
and
clamor
the
pure
light
up
there
made
it
easy
to
see
clearly
and
i
saw
that
i
have
been
silly
and
ungrateful
forgive
me
you
know
best
about
nancy
you
who
have
seen
her
and
i
just
come
down
from
that
holy
hour
on
the
hills
am
very
willing
to
love
her
i
will
not
turn
my
back
upon
a
ready
friend
she
can
have
no
motive
but
a
good
one
roger
i
am
a
blunderer
a
clumsy
creature
with
not
one
of
my
elemental
passions
bound
down
yet
into
the
decent
listlessness
of
chains
but
i
shall
grow
better
grow
more
worthy
of
you
not
a
day
shall
pass
without
my
having
been
a
little
wiser
than
the
day
before
a
little
kinder
a
little
more
patient
i
wish
you
had
been
with
me
this
morning
it
was
so
still
and
the
sky
so
clear
that
i
sat
on
the
old
last
year
grass
as
warmly
as
in
summer
i
felt
irradiated
with
life
and
love
light
shining
on
to
every
tiresome
incident
of
life
and
turning
it
into
beauty
love
for
the
whole
wonderful
world
and
all
the
people
in
it
and
all
the
beasts
and
flowers
and
all
the
happy
living
things
indeed
blessings
have
been
given
me
in
full
measure
pressed
down
and
running
over
in
the
whole
of
that
little
town
at
my
feet
so
quiet
so
bathed
in
lovely
light
there
was
not
there
could
not
be
another
being
so
happy
as
myself
surely
i
am
far
too
happy
to
grudge
accepting
a
kindness
i
tell
you
i
marvel
at
the
energy
of
my
protest
yesterday
perhaps
it
was
oh
roger
after
those
hours
on
the
hills
i
will
be
honest
i
will
pull
off
the
veil
from
feelings
that
the
female
mind
generally
refuses
to
uncover
perhaps
the
real
reason
the
real
pitiful
mean
reason
was
that
i
felt
sure
somehow
from
your
description
of
her
that
nancy
must
be
very
perfect
things
things
beyond
words
perfect
and
i
was
jealous
of
her
blouses
there
now
xi
jena
i
am
glad
you
did
not
laugh
at
that
silly
letter
of
mine
about
scorching
in
the
sun
on
rocks
indeed
i
gather
my
dear
roger
that
you
liked
it
make
the
most
of
it
then
for
there
will
be
no
more
of
the
sort
a
decent
woman
never
gets
on
to
rocks
and
if
she
scorches
she
does
say
so
and
i
believe
that
it
is
held
to
be
generally
desirable
that
she
should
not
even
under
really
trying
circumstances
part
with
her
dignity
i
rather
think
the
principle
was
originally
laid
down
by
the
husband
of
an
attractive
wife
but
it
is
a
good
one
and
so
long
as
i
am
busy
clinging
to
my
dignity
obviously
i
shall
have
no
leisure
for
clinging
to
you
and
then
you
will
not
be
suffocated
with
the
superabundance
of
my
follies
about
those
two
sinners
who
are
appalling
us
how
can
i
agree
with
you
to
do
so
would
cut
away
the
ground
from
under
my
own
feet
the
woman
plays
such
a
losing
game
she
gives
so
much
and
gets
so
little
so
long
as
the
man
loves
her
i
do
see
that
he
is
worth
the
good
opinion
of
neighbors
and
relations
which
is
one
of
the
chilliest
things
in
the
world
but
he
never
seems
able
to
go
on
loving
her
once
she
has
begun
to
wither
that
is
very
odd
she
does
not
mind
his
withering
and
has
she
not
a
soul
and
does
not
that
grow
always
lovelier
but
what
then
becomes
of
her
for
wither
she
certainly
will
and
years
rush
past
at
such
a
terrific
pace
that
almost
before
she
has
begun
to
be
happy
it
is
over
he
goes
back
to
his
wife
a
person
who
has
been
either
patient
or
bitter
according
to
the
quantity
of
her
vitality
and
the
quality
of
her
personal
interests
and
concludes
while
he
watches
her
sewing
on
his
buttons
in
the
corner
she
has
probably
been
sitting
in
through
all
his
vagrant
years
that
marriage
has
its
uses
and
that
it
is
good
to
know
there
will
be
some
one
bound
to
take
care
of
you
up
to
the
last
and
who
will
shed
decent
tears
when
you
are
buried
she
goes
back
but
where
and
to
what
they
have
gone
long
ago
her
husband
her
children
her
friends
and
she
is
old
and
alone
you
too
like
everybody
else
seem
unable
to
remember
how
transient
things
are
time
goes
emotions
wear
out
you
say
these
people
are
in
the
hands
of
fate
and
can
no
more
get
out
of
them
and
do
differently
than
a
fly
in
a
web
can
walk
away
when
it
sees
the
hungry
spider
coming
nearer
i
do
believe
in
webs
and
spiders
at
least
i
do
today
today
i
believe
only
in
my
unconquerable
soul
i
am
the
master
of
my
fate
i
am
the
captain
of
my
soul
and
you
say
that
a
person
in
the
grip
of
a
great
feeling
should
not
care
a
straw
for
circumstance
should
defy
it
trample
it
under
foot
heaven
knows
that
i
too
am
for
love
and
laughter
for
the
snatching
of
flying
opportunities
for
all
that
makes
the
light
and
the
glory
of
life
but
what
afterwards
the
afterwards
haunts
me
like
a
weeping
ghost
it
is
true
there
is
still
the
wide
world
the
warm
sun
and
harvest
shakespeare
the
book
of
job
singing
birds
flowers
but
the
soul
that
has
transgressed
the
laws
of
man
seems
for
ever
afterwards
unable
to
use
the
gifts
of
god
if
supreme
joy
could
be
rounded
off
by
death
death
at
the
exact
right
moment
how
easy
things
would
be
only
death
has
a
strange
way
of
shunning
those
persons
who
want
him
most
to
long
to
die
seems
to
make
you
as
nearly
immortal
as
it
is
possible
to
become
now
just
think
what
would
have
happened
if
tristan
had
not
been
killed
had
lived
on
quite
healthily
king
mark
than
whom
i
know
no
man
in
literature
more
polite
would
have
handed
isolde
over
to
him
as
he
declared
himself
ready
to
have
done
had
he
been
aware
of
the
unfortunately
complicated
state
of
things
and
he
would
have
done
it
with
every
expression
of
decent
regret
at
the
inconvenience
he
had
caused
isolde
would
have
married
tristan
there
would
have
been
no
philosophy
no
divine
hours
in
the
garden
no
acute
exquisite
anguish
of
love
and
sorrow
but
there
would
presently
have
been
the
middle
ages
equivalent
for
a
perambulator
a
contented
tristan
coming
to
meet
it
a
faded
isolde
who
did
not
care
for
poetry
admonishing
perhaps
with
sharpness
a
mediæval
nursemaid
and
quite
quickly
afterwards
a
tristan
grown
too
comfortable
to
move
and
an
isolde
with
wrinkles
would
we
not
have
lost
a
great
deal
if
they
had
lived
it
is
certain
that
they
themselves
would
have
lost
a
great
deal
for
i
do
see
that
contentment
beaten
out
thin
enough
to
cover
a
long
life
and
beat
as
thin
as
you
will
it
never
does
cover
quite
across
the
years
is
to
be
compared
with
one
supreme
contentment
heaped
in
one
heap
on
the
highest
keenest
point
of
living
we
reach
now
i
am
apparently
arguing
on
your
side
but
i
not
really
because
you
you
know
think
of
love
as
a
perpetual
and
i
though
i
do
hear
the
and
follow
it
with
a
joyful
clapping
of
hands
up
to
the
very
top
of
its
splendor
can
never
forget
the
drop
on
the
other
side
the
inevitable
to
the
dead
level
and
then
why
the
rest
is
not
even
silence
but
a
querulous
murmur
a
querulous
confused
whining
confused
complaining
not
very
loud
not
very
definite
but
always
there
till
the
last
chord
is
reached
a
long
time
afterwards
that
satisfactory
common
chord
of
death
my
point
is
that
if
you
want
to
let
yourself
go
to
great
emotions
you
ought
to
have
the
luck
to
die
at
an
interesting
moment
the
alternative
makes
such
a
dreary
picture
and
it
is
the
picture
i
always
see
when
i
hear
of
love
at
defiance
with
the
law
the
law
wins
always
inevitably
husbands
are
best
always
inevitably
really
the
most
unsatisfactory
husband
is
a
person
who
should
be
clung
to
steadily
from
beginning
to
end
for
did
not
one
marry
him
of
own
free
will
how
ugly
then
because
one
had
been
hasty
foolish
unacquainted
with
one
usually
quite
worthless
mind
to
punish
him
the
brilliant
professor
the
fascinating
little
lady
what
are
they
but
grossly
selfish
people
cruelly
punishing
the
husband
and
wife
who
had
the
misfortune
to
marry
them
oh
it
a
mercy
most
of
us
are
homely
slow
of
wit
heavy
of
foot
for
so
at
least
we
stay
at
home
and
find
our
peace
in
fearful
innocence
and
household
laws
please
note
my
familiarity
with
the
british
poets
but
is
that
a
picture
of
frugal
happiness
of
the
happiness
that
comes
from
a
daily
simple
obedience
to
the
stern
daughter
of
the
voice
of
god
beside
which
stormy
tremendous
brief
things
come
off
very
badly
i
do
believe
you
do
in
your
heart
side
with
the
two
sinners
bother
them
they
have
made
me
feel
like
a
lutheran
pastor
on
a
sunday
afternoon
but
you
know
i
love
you
xii
jena
when
do
you
go
back
to
jermyn
street
surely
today
for
is
not
the
examination
your
description
of
the
cheriton
at
clinches
is
like
fairyland
no
wonder
you
feel
so
happy
there
my
mother
used
to
tell
me
about
life
in
england
but
apparently
the
watson
family
did
not
dwell
in
houses
like
clinches
anyhow
i
had
an
impression
of
little
houses
with
little
staircases
and
and
a
servant
in
a
cap
with
streamers
and
round
white
balls
of
suet
with
currants
in
them
very
often
for
dinner
but
clinches
beautiful
and
dignified
in
the
mists
and
subtleties
of
a
november
afternoon
its
massed
grayness
melting
into
that
other
grayness
its
setting
of
mysterious
blurred
wood
and
pale
light
of
water
its
spaciousness
its
pleasant
people
its
daughter
with
the
dusky
hair
and
odd
gray
eyes
is
a
vision
of
fairyland
i
can
not
conceive
what
life
is
like
in
such
places
nor
i
am
sure
could
any
other
inhabitant
of
jena
what
for
instance
can
it
be
like
to
live
in
a
thing
so
big
that
you
do
not
hear
the
sounds
nor
smell
the
smells
of
the
kitchen
ought
not
people
who
live
in
such
places
to
have
unusually
beautiful
ways
of
looking
at
life
of
thinking
of
speaking
one
imagines
it
all
very
noble
very
gracious
altogether
worthy
that
complete
separation
from
the
kitchen
is
what
wrings
the
biggest
sigh
of
envy
out
of
me
is
it
my
english
blood
that
makes
me
rebel
against
kitchens
or
is
it
only
my
unfortunate
sensitiveness
to
smell
i
wish
i
had
no
nose
it
has
always
been
a
nuisance
it
is
as
extravagantly
delighted
by
exquisite
scents
as
it
is
extravagantly
horrified
by
nasty
ones
why
a
beautiful
smell
if
it
is
delicate
subtle
intermittent
can
ruin
a
morning
for
me
it
fills
me
with
a
quite
unworthy
rapture
things
that
ought
to
be
hard
in
me
melt
things
that
ought
to
be
fixed
are
scattered
heaven
knows
where
i
go
soft
ecstatic
basely
idle
i
forget
that
my
business
is
to
get
dinner
and
not
to
stand
still
and
just
sniff
in
march
i
dare
not
pass
the
house
schiller
used
to
live
in
on
my
way
to
market
because
the
people
who
live
there
now
have
planted
violets
along
the
railings
it
is
the
shortest
way
and
it
takes
ten
more
minutes
out
of
a
busy
morning
to
go
round
by
the
post
office
but
really
for
a
grown
woman
to
stand
lost
in
what
is
mere
voluptuous
pleasure
leaning
against
somebody
railing
while
the
family
dinner
lies
still
unbought
in
the
is
conduct
that
i
can
not
justify
as
for
a
beanfield
my
dear
roger
did
you
ever
come
across
a
beanfield
in
flower
it
is
the
divinest
experience
the
nose
can
give
us
two
years
ago
an
englishman
came
and
spent
a
spring
and
summer
in
the
little
house
in
the
apple
orchard
up
on
the
road
over
the
galgenberg
the
little
house
with
the
blue
shutters
and
he
was
a
great
gardener
and
he
dug
a
big
patch
and
planted
a
beanfield
and
it
was
the
first
beanfield
jena
had
ever
seen
for
those
beans
called
broad
that
you
eat
in
england
and
are
properly
thankful
for
are
only
grown
in
germany
for
the
use
of
pigs
and
there
are
no
pigs
in
jena
they
are
called
here
mindful
of
their
destiny
the
englishman
who
possessed
no
visible
sow
was
a
source
of
astonishment
to
us
the
things
came
up
and
were
undoubtedly
a
great
square
patch
of
them
grew
up
just
over
the
fence
on
which
jena
leaned
and
pondered
the
man
himself
was
seen
in
his
weeding
them
on
rainy
afternoons
jena
could
only
suspect
a
pig
concealed
in
the
parlor
and
was
indulgent
and
it
was
indulgent
because
no
one
in
its
opinion
can
be
both
english
and
sane
made
us
all
was
its
invariable
helpless
conclusion
as
it
went
shaking
its
head
home
down
the
hill
when
in
june
the
beanfield
flowered
i
blessed
that
englishman
no
one
hung
over
his
fence
more
persistently
than
i
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
smelt
the
like
it
became
an
obsession
i
wanted
to
be
there
at
every
sort
of
time
and
under
every
sort
of
at
noon
when
the
sun
shone
straight
down
on
it
drawing
up
its
perfume
in
hot
breaths
i
was
there
in
the
morning
so
early
that
it
was
still
in
the
blue
shadow
of
the
galgenberg
and
every
gray
leaf
and
white
petal
was
drenched
with
dew
i
was
there
on
wet
afternoons
when
the
scent
was
crushed
out
of
it
by
the
beating
of
heavy
rain
and
the
road
for
half
a
mile
the
slippery
clay
road
with
its
puddles
and
amazing
mud
was
turned
into
a
bath
of
fragrance
fit
for
the
tenderest
most
fastidious
goddess
to
bare
her
darling
little
limbs
in
i
was
there
and
once
after
lying
awake
in
my
hot
room
so
near
the
roof
for
hours
thinking
of
it
out
there
on
the
hillside
in
the
freshness
under
the
stars
i
got
up
and
dressed
and
crept
with
infinite
caution
past
my
door
and
stole
the
latchkey
and
slunk
my
heart
in
my
mouth
through
the
stale
streets
along
all
the
railings
and
dusty
front
gardens
out
into
the
open
country
up
on
to
the
hill
to
where
it
stood
in
straight
and
motionless
rows
sending
out
waves
of
fragrance
into
that
wonderful
clean
air
you
find
in
all
the
places
where
men
leave
off
and
god
begins
did
you
ever
know
a
woman
before
who
risked
her
reputation
for
a
beanfield
well
it
is
what
i
did
and
i
tell
you
i
am
so
incurably
honest
that
i
can
never
for
long
pretend
why
i
write
all
this
about
it
it
is
that
i
am
sick
with
anxiety
oh
sick
cold
shivering
with
it
about
your
exam
i
did
want
you
to
know
i
tried
to
write
of
beanfields
instead
i
did
want
you
to
be
bothered
the
clamorings
for
news
of
the
person
not
on
the
spot
are
always
a
worry
and
i
did
not
want
to
worry
but
the
letter
i
got
from
you
this
morning
never
mentions
the
exam
the
thing
on
which
as
you
told
me
everything
depends
for
us
you
talk
about
clinches
about
the
people
there
about
the
shooting
the
long
days
in
woods
the
of
nancy
who
goes
with
you
who
understands
before
you
have
spoken
who
sympathizes
so
kindly
about
me
who
fits
you
say
so
strangely
into
the
misty
winter
landscape
in
her
paleness
her
thinness
her
spiritualness
there
was
one
whole
page
oh
i
grudged
it
about
her
loosely
done
dark
hair
how
softly
dusky
it
is
how
it
makes
you
think
of
twilight
and
her
eyes
beneath
it
of
the
first
faint
shining
of
stars
i
wonder
if
these
things
really
fill
your
thoughts
or
whether
you
are
only
using
them
to
drive
away
useless
worry
about
saturday
i
know
you
are
a
poet
and
a
poet
pleasure
in
eyes
and
hair
is
not
a
very
personal
thing
so
i
do
not
mind
that
but
is
saturday
shall
you
send
me
a
telegram
i
wonder
a
week
ago
i
would
not
have
wondered
i
should
have
been
so
sure
you
would
let
me
have
one
little
word
at
once
about
how
you
felt
it
had
gone
off
one
little
word
for
the
person
so
far
away
so
helpless
so
dependent
on
your
kindness
for
the
very
power
to
go
on
living
oh
what
stuff
this
is
worse
even
than
the
beanfield
but
i
must
be
sentimental
sometimes
now
must
i
or
i
would
not
be
a
woman
but
really
my
darling
i
am
very
anxious
xiii
jena
i
have
waited
all
day
and
there
has
been
no
telegram
well
on
monday
i
shall
get
a
letter
about
it
and
how
much
more
satisfactory
that
is
today
after
all
is
nearly
over
and
there
is
only
sunday
to
be
got
through
first
and
i
shall
be
helped
to
endure
that
by
the
looking
forward
is
it
a
mercy
that
we
never
get
cured
of
being
expectant
it
makes
life
so
bearable
however
regularly
we
are
disappointed
and
nothing
whatever
happens
after
the
first
blow
has
fallen
after
the
first
catch
of
the
breath
the
first
gulp
of
misery
we
turn
our
eyes
with
all
their
old
eagerness
to
a
point
a
little
further
along
the
road
i
suppose
in
time
the
regular
repetition
of
shocks
does
wear
out
hope
and
then
i
imagine
one
youth
collapses
like
a
house
of
cards
real
old
age
begins
then
inward
as
well
as
outward
and
one
soul
that
kept
so
bravely
young
for
years
after
one
face
got
its
first
wrinkles
suddenly
shrivels
up
its
light
goes
out
it
is
suddenly
and
irrecoverably
old
blank
dark
indifferent
sunday
night
i
did
finish
my
letter
last
night
because
observing
the
strain
i
had
got
into
i
thought
it
better
for
your
comfort
that
i
should
go
to
bed
so
i
did
and
while
i
went
there
i
asked
myself
why
i
should
burden
you
with
the
dull
weight
of
my
elementary
reflections
you
who
are
so
clever
and
who
think
so
much
and
so
clearly
must
laugh
at
their
elementariness
they
are
green
and
immature
the
acid
juice
of
an
imperfect
fruit
that
has
always
hung
in
the
shadow
and
yet
i
think
you
must
laugh
roger
it
would
after
all
be
as
cruel
as
the
laughter
of
a
child
watching
a
blind
man
ridiculously
stumbling
among
the
difficulties
of
the
way
the
one
sunday
post
brought
nothing
from
you
the
day
has
been
very
long
i
can
not
tell
you
how
glad
i
am
night
has
come
and
only
sleep
separates
me
now
from
monday
morning
letter
these
sundays
now
that
you
are
gone
are
intolerable
before
you
came
they
rather
amused
me
the
furious
raging
of
saturday
with
its
extra
cleaning
and
feverish
preparations
till
far
into
the
night
johanna
more
than
usually
slipshod
all
day
red
of
elbow
wispy
of
hair
shuffling
about
in
her
felt
slippers
her
skirt
girded
up
very
high
a
moist
mop
and
an
overflowing
pail
dribbling
soapy
tracks
behind
her
in
her
progress
my
baking
and
not
lightly
to
be
approached
papa
fled
from
early
morning
till
and
then
the
dead
calm
of
sunday
day
of
food
and
sleep
cake
for
breakfast
such
a
bad
beginning
church
in
the
university
chapel
with
my
in
her
best
hat
with
the
black
feathers
and
the
pink
rose
it
sounds
frivolous
but
you
must
have
noticed
the
effect
of
it
coming
so
unexpectedly
on
the
top
of
her
long
respectable
face
and
hair
a
fluffy
person
in
that
hat
would
have
all
the
students
offering
to
take
her
for
a
walk
or
share
their
umbrella
with
her
my
stalks
along
panoplied
in
her
excellences
and
the
feather
waves
and
nods
gayly
at
the
passing
student
as
he
slinks
away
down
once
last
spring
a
silly
bee
thought
the
rose
must
be
something
alive
and
honeyful
and
went
and
smelt
it
i
think
it
must
have
been
a
very
young
bee
anyhow
nobody
else
up
to
now
has
misjudged
my
like
that
she
sits
near
the
door
in
church
and
has
never
yet
heard
the
last
half
of
the
sermon
because
she
has
to
go
out
in
time
to
put
the
goose
or
other
sunday
succulence
safely
into
the
oven
i
wish
she
would
let
me
do
that
for
i
do
care
for
sermons
when
you
were
here
and
condescended
to
come
with
us
at
least
we
could
criticize
them
comfortably
on
our
way
home
but
alone
with
my
i
may
do
nothing
but
praise
it
is
the
most
tiring
tiresome
of
all
attitudes
the
one
of
undiscriminating
admiration
to
hear
you
pull
the
person
who
had
preached
to
pieces
and
laugh
at
the
things
he
had
said
that
would
not
bear
examination
used
to
be
like
having
a
window
thrown
open
in
a
stuffy
room
on
a
clear
morning
shall
you
ever
forget
the
elaborateness
of
the
sunday
dinner
for
that
chiefly
is
saturday
sacrificed
a
whole
day
that
might
be
filled
with
lovely
leisure
i
do
hope
you
never
thought
that
i
too
looked
upon
it
as
a
nice
way
of
celebrating
sunday
how
amazing
it
is
the
way
women
waste
life
men
waste
enough
of
it
heaven
knows
but
never
anything
like
so
much
as
women
papa
and
i
both
hate
that
sunday
dinner
both
dread
the
upheavals
of
saturday
made
necessary
by
it
and
you
i
know
disliked
them
just
as
much
and
so
has
every
other
young
man
we
have
had
here
yet
my
inflicts
these
things
on
us
with
an
iron
determination
that
nothing
will
ever
alter
and
why
only
because
she
was
brought
up
in
the
belief
that
it
was
proper
and
because
if
she
omitted
to
do
the
proper
female
jena
would
be
aghast
well
i
think
it
a
bad
thing
to
be
what
is
known
as
brought
up
you
why
should
we
poor
helpless
little
children
all
soft
and
resistless
be
squeezed
and
jammed
into
the
rusty
iron
bands
of
parental
points
of
view
why
should
we
have
to
have
points
of
view
at
all
why
not
for
those
few
divine
years
when
we
are
still
so
near
god
leave
us
just
to
guess
and
wonder
we
are
not
given
a
chance
on
our
pulpy
little
minds
our
parents
carve
their
opinions
and
the
mass
slowly
hardens
and
all
those
deep
narrow
up
and
down
strokes
harden
with
it
and
the
first
thing
the
best
of
us
have
to
do
on
growing
up
is
to
waste
precious
time
rubbing
and
beating
at
the
things
to
try
to
get
them
out
surely
the
child
of
the
most
admirable
wise
parent
is
richer
with
his
own
faulty
but
original
point
of
view
than
he
would
be
fitted
out
with
the
choicest
selection
of
maxims
and
conclusions
that
he
did
not
have
to
think
out
for
himself
i
could
never
be
a
schoolmistress
i
should
be
afraid
to
teach
the
children
they
know
more
than
i
do
they
know
how
to
be
happy
how
to
live
from
day
to
day
in
indifference
to
what
may
come
next
and
is
not
how
to
be
happy
the
secret
we
spend
our
lives
trying
to
guess
why
then
should
i
by
forcing
them
to
look
through
my
stale
eyes
show
them
as
through
a
dreadful
magnifying
glass
the
terrific
possibilities
the
cruel
explosiveness
of
what
they
had
been
lightly
tossing
to
each
other
across
the
daisies
and
thinking
were
only
toys
today
at
dinner
when
papa
had
got
to
the
stage
immediately
following
the
first
course
at
which
his
hunger
satisfied
he
begins
to
fidget
and
grow
more
and
more
unhappy
and
my
was
conversing
blandly
but
firmly
with
the
tried
and
ancient
friend
she
invites
to
bear
witness
that
we
too
have
a
goose
on
sundays
and
i
had
begun
to
droop
i
hope
poetically
like
a
thirsty
flower
let
us
say
or
a
broken
lily
over
my
plate
i
thought
oh
how
longingly
i
thought
of
the
happy
past
meals
made
happy
because
you
were
here
sitting
opposite
me
and
i
could
watch
you
how
short
they
seemed
in
those
days
you
did
know
i
was
watching
you
did
you
but
i
was
and
i
learned
to
do
it
so
artfully
so
cautiously
when
you
turned
your
head
and
talked
to
papa
i
could
do
it
openly
when
you
talked
to
me
i
could
look
straight
in
your
dear
eyes
while
i
answered
but
when
i
was
answering
i
still
looked
at
you
by
devious
routes
carefully
concealed
routes
that
grew
so
familiar
by
practice
that
at
last
i
never
missed
a
single
expression
while
you
i
suppose
imagined
you
had
nothing
before
you
but
a
young
woman
with
a
vacant
face
what
talks
and
laughs
we
will
have
about
that
odd
foolish
year
we
spent
here
together
in
our
blindness
when
next
we
meet
had
no
time
to
say
anything
at
all
yet
there
are
thousands
of
things
i
want
to
ask
you
about
thousands
of
little
things
we
said
and
did
that
seem
so
strange
now
in
the
light
of
our
acknowledged
love
my
heart
stands
still
at
the
thought
of
when
next
we
meet
these
letters
have
been
so
intimate
and
we
were
not
intimate
i
shall
be
deadly
shy
when
in
your
presence
i
remember
what
i
have
written
and
what
you
have
written
we
are
still
such
strangers
bodily
personally
strangers
with
the
overwhelming
memory
of
that
last
hour
together
to
make
us
turn
hot
and
tremble
now
i
am
going
to
bed
to
dream
of
you
i
suppose
considering
that
all
day
long
i
am
thinking
of
you
and
perhaps
i
shall
have
a
little
luck
and
dream
that
i
hear
you
speaking
you
know
roger
i
love
you
for
all
sorts
of
queer
and
apparently
inadequate
reasons
i
wo
tell
you
what
they
are
for
they
are
quite
absurd
things
that
have
to
do
with
eyebrows
and
the
shape
of
hands
so
you
see
quite
foolish
things
but
most
of
all
i
love
you
for
your
voice
a
beautiful
speaking
voice
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
gifts
of
the
gods
it
is
so
rare
and
it
is
so
irresistible
papa
says
heaps
of
nice
poetic
things
but
then
the
darling
pipes
the
most
eloquent
lecturer
we
have
here
does
all
his
eloquence
which
is
really
very
great
read
afterward
in
print
in
a
voice
of
beer
loose
throaty
reminiscent
of
barrels
not
one
of
the
preachers
who
come
to
the
university
chapel
has
a
voice
that
does
not
spoil
the
merit
there
may
be
in
what
he
says
sometimes
i
think
that
if
a
man
with
the
right
voice
were
to
get
up
in
that
pulpit
and
just
say
christ
died
for
you
oh
then
i
think
that
all
i
have
and
am
body
mind
soul
would
be
struck
into
one
great
passion
of
gratefulness
and
love
and
that
i
would
fall
conquered
on
my
face
before
the
cross
on
the
altar
and
cry
and
cry
xiv
jena
monday
night
the
last
post
has
been
no
letter
if
you
had
posted
it
in
london
on
saturday
after
the
examination
i
ought
to
have
had
it
by
now
i
am
tortured
by
the
fear
that
something
has
happened
to
you
such
dreadful
things
do
happen
those
great
blundering
blind
fists
of
fate
laying
about
in
mechanical
cruelty
crushing
the
most
precious
lives
as
indifferently
as
we
crush
an
ant
in
an
afternoon
walk
how
they
terrify
me
all
day
i
have
been
seeing
foolish
horrible
pictures
your
train
to
london
smashing
up
your
cab
coming
to
grief
the
thousand
things
that
might
so
easily
happen
really
doing
it
at
last
i
sent
my
two
letters
to
jermyn
street
supposing
you
would
have
left
clinches
but
now
somehow
i
do
think
you
did
leave
it
but
went
up
from
there
for
the
exam
do
you
know
it
is
three
days
since
i
heard
from
you
that
would
matter
so
much
for
i
am
determined
never
to
bother
you
to
write
i
am
determined
i
will
never
be
an
exacting
woman
if
it
were
not
for
the
examination
you
said
that
if
you
passed
it
well
and
got
a
good
place
in
the
foreign
office
you
would
feel
justified
in
telling
your
father
about
us
that
means
that
we
would
be
openly
engaged
not
that
i
care
for
that
or
want
it
except
as
the
next
step
to
our
meeting
again
it
is
clear
that
we
can
not
meet
again
till
our
engagement
is
known
even
if
you
could
get
away
and
come
over
for
a
few
days
i
would
not
see
you
i
will
not
be
kissed
behind
doors
these
things
are
too
wonderful
to
be
handled
after
the
manner
of
i
am
willing
to
be
as
silent
as
the
grave
for
as
long
as
you
choose
but
so
long
as
i
am
silent
we
shall
not
meet
i
tell
you
i
am
incurably
honest
i
can
not
bear
to
lie
and
even
these
letters
this
perpetual
writing
when
no
one
is
likely
to
look
this
perpetual
watching
for
the
postman
so
that
no
one
will
be
likely
to
see
does
not
make
me
love
myself
any
better
it
is
true
i
need
not
have
watched
quite
so
carefully
lately
need
i
oh
roger
why
do
you
write
what
has
happened
think
of
my
wretched
plight
if
you
are
just
left
to
wonder
at
the
silence
to
gnaw
away
at
my
miserable
heart
or
if
some
one
took
pity
on
me
and
sent
me
word
your
servant
or
the
doctor
or
the
kind
nancy
what
could
i
do
even
then
but
still
sit
here
and
wait
how
could
i
a
person
of
whom
nobody
has
heard
go
to
you
it
seems
to
me
that
the
whole
world
has
a
right
to
be
with
you
to
know
about
you
except
myself
i
can
not
wait
for
the
next
post
the
waiting
for
these
posts
makes
me
feel
physically
sick
if
the
man
is
a
little
late
what
torments
i
suffer
lest
he
should
not
be
coming
at
all
then
i
hear
him
trudging
up
the
stairs
i
fly
to
the
door
absolutely
vainly
trying
to
choke
down
hope
will
be
no
letter
no
letter
no
letter
i
keep
on
crying
to
my
thumping
heart
so
that
the
disappointment
shall
not
be
quite
so
bitter
and
it
takes
no
notice
but
thumps
back
wildly
there
will
there
will
and
what
the
man
gives
me
is
a
circular
for
papa
it
is
quite
absurd
madly
absurd
the
anguish
i
feel
when
that
happens
my
one
wish
my
only
wish
as
i
creep
back
again
down
the
passage
to
my
work
is
that
i
could
go
to
sleep
and
sleep
and
sleep
and
forget
that
i
have
ever
hoped
for
anything
sleep
for
years
and
wake
up
quiet
and
old
with
all
these
passionate
tearing
feelings
gone
from
me
for
ever
xv
jena
last
night
i
got
your
letter
written
on
sunday
at
clinches
a
place
from
which
letters
do
not
seem
to
depart
easily
my
knowledge
of
geography
is
limited
so
how
could
i
guess
that
it
was
so
easy
to
go
up
to
london
from
there
for
the
exam
and
back
again
the
same
day
as
you
had
no
time
you
say
to
go
to
jermyn
street
i
suppose
the
two
letters
i
sent
there
will
be
forwarded
to
you
if
they
are
not
it
does
not
matter
they
were
only
a
string
of
little
trivial
things
that
would
look
really
quite
too
little
and
trivial
to
be
worth
reading
in
the
magnificence
of
clinches
i
am
glad
you
are
well
glad
you
are
happy
glad
you
feel
you
did
not
do
badly
on
saturday
it
is
a
good
thing
to
be
well
and
happy
and
satisfied
and
a
pleasant
thing
to
have
found
a
friend
who
takes
so
much
interest
in
you
and
to
whom
you
can
tell
your
most
sacred
thoughts
doubly
pleasant
of
course
when
the
friend
chances
to
be
a
woman
and
she
is
pretty
and
young
and
rich
and
everything
else
that
is
suitable
and
desirable
the
world
is
an
amusing
place
my
talked
of
you
this
morning
at
breakfast
she
was
it
seems
in
a
prophetic
mood
she
shook
her
head
after
the
manner
of
the
more
gloomy
of
the
prophets
and
hoped
you
would
steer
clear
of
entanglements
why
should
he
not
inquired
papa
for
nothing
has
he
got
that
mouth

jena
my
darling
forgive
me
if
i
could
only
get
it
back
i
who
hate
unreasonableness
who
hate
bitterness
who
hate
exacting
women
petty
women
jealous
women
to
write
a
thing
so
angry
how
horrible
this
is
if
i
had
said
all
that
to
you
in
a
sudden
flare
of
wrath
i
would
have
been
sorry
so
immediately
and
at
once
have
made
everything
fair
and
sweet
again
with
a
kiss
and
i
never
would
have
got
beyond
the
first
words
never
have
reached
my
silly
and
rude
remarks
never
have
dreamed
of
repeating
the
unkind
unjust
things
now
roger
listen
to
me
my
faith
in
you
is
perfect
my
love
for
you
is
perfect
but
i
am
so
undisciplined
so
new
to
love
that
you
must
be
patient
you
must
be
ready
to
forgive
easily
for
a
little
while
till
i
have
had
time
to
grow
wise
just
think
when
you
feel
irritated
of
the
circumstances
of
my
life
everything
has
come
so
easily
so
naturally
to
you
but
i
have
been
always
poor
always
oh
true
shut
out
from
the
best
things
and
people
lonely
because
the
society
i
could
have
was
too
little
worth
having
and
the
society
i
would
have
liked
did
want
me
how
could
it
it
never
came
our
way
never
even
knew
we
were
there
i
have
had
a
shabby
restricted
incomplete
life
i
mean
the
last
ten
years
of
it
since
my
father
married
again
before
that
if
the
shabbiness
was
there
i
did
not
see
it
there
seemed
to
be
sunshine
every
day
and
room
to
breathe
and
laughter
enough
but
then
i
was
a
child
and
saw
sunshine
everywhere
is
there
not
much
excuse
for
some
one
who
has
found
a
treasure
some
one
till
then
very
needy
if
his
anxiety
lest
he
should
be
robbed
makes
him
irritable
you
see
i
put
it
mildly
i
know
very
well
that
irritable
is
the
right
word
i
know
very
well
what
are
the
right
words
and
how
horrid
they
are
and
how
much
ashamed
i
am
of
their
bitter
truth
pity
me
a
person
so
unbalanced
so
stripped
of
all
that
she
writes
things
she
knows
must
hurt
to
the
being
she
loves
so
utterly
does
deserve
pity
from
better
serener
natures
i
do
not
understand
you
yet
i
do
not
understand
the
ways
yet
of
people
who
live
as
you
do
i
am
socially
inferior
and
therefore
sensitive
and
suspicious
i
am
groping
about
and
am
so
blind
that
only
sometimes
can
i
dimly
feel
how
dark
it
really
is
i
have
built
up
a
set
of
ideals
about
love
and
lovers
absurd
crude
things
clumsy
fabrics
suited
to
the
conditions
of
rauchgasse
and
the
first
time
you
do
not
exactly
fit
them
i
am
desperately
certain
that
the
world
is
coming
to
an
end
but
how
hopeless
it
is
this
trying
to
explain
this
trying
to
undo
how
shall
i
live
till
you
write
that
you
do
still
love
me
your
wretched
xvii
jena
i
counted
up
my
money
this
morning
to
see
if
there
would
be
enough
to
take
me
to
england
supposing
some
day
i
should
wake
up
and
find
myself
no
longer
able
to
bear
the
silence
i
know
i
should
be
mad
if
i
went
but
sometimes
one
is
mad
there
was
not
nearly
enough
the
cheapest
route
would
cost
more
than
comes
in
my
way
during
a
year
i
have
a
ring
of
my
mother
with
a
diamond
in
it
my
only
treasure
that
i
might
sell
i
never
wear
it
my
red
hands
are
not
pretty
enough
for
rings
so
it
is
only
sentiment
that
makes
it
precious
and
if
it
would
take
me
to
you
and
give
me
just
one
talk
with
you
and
sweep
away
the
icy
fog
that
seems
to
be
settling
down
on
my
soul
and
shutting
out
everything
that
is
wholesome
and
sweet
i
am
sure
my
darling
mother
whose
one
thought
was
always
to
make
me
happy
would
say
go
and
sell
it
and
buy
peace
xviii
jena
last
night
i
dreamed
i
did
go
to
england
and
i
found
you
in
a
room
with
a
crowd
of
people
and
you
nodded
not
unkindly
and
went
on
talking
to
the
others
and
i
waited
in
my
corner
till
they
should
have
gone
waited
for
the
moment
when
we
would
run
into
each
other
arms
and
with
the
last
group
you
too
went
out
talking
and
laughing
and
did
not
come
back
again
it
was
not
that
you
wanted
to
avoid
me
you
had
simply
forgotten
that
i
was
there
and
i
crept
out
into
the
street
and
it
was
raining
and
through
the
rain
i
made
my
way
back
across
europe
to
my
home
to
the
one
place
where
they
would
not
shut
me
out
and
when
i
opened
the
door
all
the
empty
future
years
were
waiting
for
me
there
gray
vacant
listless

jena
these
scraps
of
letters
are
not
worth
the
postman
trouble
are
not
worth
the
stamps
but
if
i
did
not
talk
to
you
a
little
every
day
i
do
not
think
i
could
live
yesterday
you
got
my
angry
letter
if
you
were
not
at
clinches
i
could
have
had
an
answer
as
it
is
i
must
wait
till
wednesday
roger
i
am
really
a
cheerful
person
you
suppose
that
it
is
my
habit
to
be
so
dreary
i
do
know
what
has
come
over
me
every
day
i
send
you
another
shred
of
gloom
and
deepen
the
wrong
impression
you
must
be
getting
of
me
i
know
very
well
that
nobody
likes
to
listen
to
sighs
and
that
no
man
can
possibly
go
on
for
long
loving
a
dreary
woman
yet
i
can
not
stop
a
dreary
man
is
bad
enough
but
he
would
be
endured
because
we
endure
every
variety
of
man
with
so
amazing
a
patience
but
a
dreary
woman
is
unforgivable
hideous
now
am
i
not
luminously
reasonable
but
only
in
theory
my
practice
lies
right
down
on
the
ground
wet
through
by
that
icy
fog
that
is
freezing
me
into
something
i
do
not
recognize
you
do
remember
i
was
cheerful
once
during
the
whole
of
your
year
with
us
i
defy
you
to
recollect
a
single
day
a
single
hour
of
gloom
well
that
is
really
how
i
always
am
and
i
can
only
suppose
that
i
am
going
to
be
ill
there
is
no
other
way
of
accounting
for
the
cold
terror
of
life
that
sits
crouching
on
my
heart
xx
dearest
you
will
be
pleased
to
hear
that
i
feel
gayer
so
that
i
can
not
after
all
be
sickening
for
anything
horrid
it
is
an
ungrateful
practice
letting
oneself
go
to
vague
fears
of
the
future
when
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
present
all
these
days
during
which
i
have
been
steeped
in
gloom
and
have
been
taking
pains
to
put
some
of
it
into
envelopes
and
send
it
to
you
were
good
days
in
themselves
life
went
on
here
quite
placidly
the
weather
was
sweet
with
that
touching
forlorn
sweetness
of
beautiful
things
of
late
autumn
when
winter
is
waiting
round
the
corner
of
leaves
dropping
slowly
down
through
clear
light
of
the
smell
of
oozy
earth
sending
up
faint
whiffs
of
corruption
from
my
window
i
saw
the
hills
every
day
at
sunset
how
wonderfully
they
dressed
themselves
in
pink
and
in
the
afternoons
in
the
free
hour
when
dinner
was
done
and
coffee
not
yet
thought
of
i
went
down
into
the
paradies
valley
and
sat
on
the
coarse
gray
grass
by
the
river
and
watched
the
water
slipping
by
beneath
the
osiers
the
one
hurried
thing
in
an
infinite
tranquillity
i
ought
to
have
had
a
volume
of
goethe
under
my
arm
and
been
happy
i
ought
to
have
read
nice
bits
out
of
or
about
those
extraordinary
people
in
the
elective
affinities
and
rejoiced
in
goethe
and
in
the
fine
days
and
in
my
good
fortune
in
being
alive
and
in
having
you
to
love
well
it
is
over
now
i
hope
i
mean
the
gloom
these
things
must
take
their
course
i
suppose
and
while
they
are
doing
it
one
must
grope
about
as
best
one
can
by
the
flickering
of
one
own
affrighted
spirit
my
looked
at
me
at
least
once
on
each
of
these
miserable
days
and
said
you
look
very
odd
i
hope
you
are
not
going
to
have
anything
expensive
measles
are
in
jena
and
also
the
of
them
is
the
cheapest
i
inquired
are
beyond
our
means
said
my
severely
and
today
at
dinner
she
was
quite
relieved
because
i
ate
some
after
having
turned
from
it
with
abhorrence
for
at
least
a
week
dearest
your
almost
cured
xxi
jena
your
letter
has
come
you
must
do
what
you
know
is
best
i
agree
to
everything
you
must
do
what
your
father
has
set
his
heart
on
since
quite
clearly
your
heart
is
set
on
the
same
thing
all
the
careful
words
in
the
world
can
not
hide
that
from
me
and
they
shall
not
do
you
think
i
dare
not
look
death
in
the
face
i
am
just
a
girl
you
kissed
once
behind
a
door
giving
way
before
a
passing
gust
of
temptation
you
can
not
shall
not
marry
me
as
the
price
of
that
slight
episode
you
say
you
will
if
i
insist
insist
my
dear
roger
with
both
hands
i
give
you
back
any
part
of
your
freedom
i
may
have
had
in
my
keeping
reason
expediency
all
the
prudences
are
on
your
side
you
depend
entirely
on
your
father
you
can
not
marry
against
his
wishes
he
has
told
you
to
marry
miss
cheriton
she
is
the
daughter
of
his
oldest
friend
she
is
extremely
rich
every
good
gift
is
hers
and
i
can
not
compete
compete
do
you
suppose
i
would
put
out
a
finger
to
compete
i
give
it
up
i
bow
myself
out
but
let
us
be
honest
apart
from
anything
to
do
with
your
commands
you
have
fallen
into
her
toils
as
completely
as
you
did
into
mine
my
was
right
about
your
softness
any
woman
who
chose
and
had
enough
opportunity
could
make
you
think
you
loved
her
make
you
kiss
her
luckily
this
one
is
absolutely
suitable
you
say
in
the
course
of
the
longest
letter
you
have
written
me
it
must
have
been
a
tiresome
letter
to
have
to
write
that
father
or
no
father
you
will
not
be
hurried
you
will
not
marry
for
a
long
time
that
the
wound
is
too
fresh
c
what
is
this
talk
of
wounds
nobody
knows
about
me
i
shall
not
be
in
your
way
you
need
observe
no
period
of
mourning
for
a
corpse
people
do
know
is
there
true
miss
cheriton
herself
knows
well
she
will
not
tell
and
if
she
does
not
mind
why
should
you
i
am
so
sorry
i
have
written
you
so
many
letters
full
of
so
many
follies
will
you
burn
them
i
would
rather
not
have
them
back
but
i
enclose
yours
as
you
may
prefer
to
burn
them
yourself
i
am
so
very
sorry
about
everything
at
least
it
has
been
short
and
not
dragged
on
growing
thinner
and
thinner
till
it
died
of
starvation
once
i
wrote
and
begged
you
to
tell
me
if
you
thought
you
had
made
a
mistake
about
me
because
i
felt
i
could
bear
to
know
better
then
than
later
and
you
wrote
back
and
swore
all
sorts
of
things
by
heaven
and
earth
all
sorts
of
convictions
and
unshakable
things
well
now
you
have
another
set
of
convictions
that
all
i
am
not
going
to
beat
the
big
drum
of
sentiment
and
make
a
wailful
noise
nothing
is
so
dead
as
a
dead
infatuation
the
more
a
person
was
infatuated
the
more
he
resents
an
attempt
to
galvanize
the
dull
dead
thing
into
life
i
am
wise
you
see
to
the
end
and
reasonable
too
i
hope
and
brave
and
brave
i
tell
you
do
you
think
i
will
be
a
coward
and
cry
out
i
make
you
a
present
of
everything
of
the
love
and
happy
thoughts
of
the
pleasant
dreams
and
plans
of
the
little
prayers
sent
up
and
the
blessings
called
down
there
were
a
great
many
every
day
of
the
kisses
and
all
the
dear
sweetness
take
it
all
i
want
nothing
from
you
in
return
remember
it
as
a
pleasant
interlude
or
fling
it
into
a
corner
of
your
mind
where
things
grow
dim
with
cobwebs
but
do
you
suppose
that
having
given
you
all
this
i
am
going
to
give
you
my
soul
as
well
to
moan
my
life
away
my
beautiful
life
you
are
not
worth
it
you
are
not
worth
anything
hardly
you
are
quite
invertebrate
my
life
shall
be
splendid
in
spite
of
you
you
shall
not
cheat
me
of
one
single
chance
of
heaven
now
please
burn
this
last
one
too
i
suppose
no
one
who
heard
it
would
quite
believe
this
story
would
quite
believe
it
possible
for
a
man
to
go
such
lengths
of
shall
we
call
it
unkindness
to
a
girl
in
a
single
month
but
you
and
i
know
it
is
true
schmidt
xxii
jena
march
dear
anstruther
it
was
extremely
kind
of
you
to
remember
my
birthday
and
to
find
time
in
the
middle
of
all
your
work
to
send
me
your
good
wishes
i
hope
you
are
getting
on
well
and
that
you
like
what
you
are
doing
professor
martens
seems
to
tell
you
all
the
jena
news
yes
i
was
ill
but
we
had
such
a
long
winter
that
it
was
rather
lucky
to
be
out
of
it
tucked
away
comfortably
in
bed
there
is
still
snow
in
the
ditches
and
on
the
shady
side
of
things
i
escaped
the
bad
weather
as
thoroughly
as
those
persons
do
who
go
with
infinite
trouble
during
these
months
to
egypt
yours
sincerely
schmidt
my
father
and
beg
to
be
remembered
to
you
xxiii
jena
march
dear
anstruther
it
is
very
kind
indeed
of
you
to
want
to
know
how
i
am
and
what
was
the
matter
with
me
it
was
anything
very
pleasant
but
quite
inoffensive
æsthetically
i
do
care
to
think
about
it
much
i
caught
cold
and
it
got
on
to
my
lungs
and
stayed
on
them
now
it
is
over
and
i
may
walk
up
and
down
the
sunny
side
of
the
street
for
half
an
hour
on
fine
days
we
all
hope
you
are
well
and
that
you
like
your
work
yours
sincerely
schmidt
xxiv
jena
march
dear
anstruther
you
ask
me
to
tell
you
more
about
my
illness
but
i
am
afraid
i
must
refuse
i
see
no
use
in
thinking
of
painful
past
things
they
ought
always
to
be
forgotten
as
quickly
as
possible
if
they
are
not
they
have
a
trick
of
turning
the
present
sour
and
i
cling
to
the
present
to
the
one
thing
one
really
has
and
like
to
make
it
as
cheerful
as
possible
like
to
get
by
industrious
squeezing
every
drop
of
honey
out
of
it
just
now
i
can
not
tell
you
how
thankful
i
am
simply
to
be
alive
with
nothing
in
my
body
hurting
to
be
alive
with
a
great
many
things
in
one
body
hurting
is
a
poor
sort
of
amusement
it
is
not
at
all
a
game
worth
playing
people
talk
of
sick
persons
clinging
to
life
however
sick
they
are
say
they
invariably
do
it
that
they
prefer
it
on
any
terms
to
dying
well
i
was
a
sick
person
who
did
not
cling
at
all
i
did
not
want
it
i
was
most
willing
to
be
done
with
it
but
death
though
he
used
often
to
come
up
and
look
at
me
and
once
at
least
sat
beside
me
for
quite
a
long
while
went
away
again
and
after
a
time
left
off
bothering
about
me
altogether
and
here
i
am
walking
out
in
the
sun
every
day
and
listening
with
immense
pleasure
to
the
chaffinches
yours
sincerely
schmidt
xxv
jena
march
dear
anstruther
yes
of
course
i
will
be
friends
and
if
i
can
be
of
any
use
in
the
way
of
admonishment
which
seems
to
be
my
strong
point
pray
as
people
say
in
books
command
me
naturally
we
are
all
much
interested
in
you
and
shall
watch
your
career
i
hope
with
pleasure
i
am
sorry
the
foreign
office
bores
you
so
much
do
you
really
have
to
spend
your
days
gumming
up
envelopes
not
for
that
did
you
win
all
those
scholarships
and
things
at
eton
and
oxford
and
study
goethe
and
the
minor
german
prophets
so
diligently
here
you
say
it
will
go
on
for
a
year
well
if
that
is
your
fate
and
you
can
not
escape
it
gum
away
gayly
since
gum
you
must
later
on
when
you
are
an
ambassador
and
everybody
is
talking
to
you
at
once
you
will
look
back
on
the
envelope
time
as
a
blessed
period
when
at
least
you
were
left
alone
but
i
hope
you
have
a
nice
wet
sponge
to
do
it
with
and
are
not
so
lost
to
what
is
expedient
as
to
be
like
a
little
girl
i
sat
next
to
yesterday
at
a
coffee
party
who
had
smudged
most
of
the
cream
that
ought
to
have
gone
inside
her
outside
her
and
when
i
suggested
a
handkerchief
said
she
did
hold
with
handkerchiefs
and
never
had
one
what
does
one
do
then
i
asked
looking
at
her
disgraceful
little
mouth
a
case
like
this
you
ca
borrow
somebody
else
it
would
be
being
select
she
said
airily
you
know
you
take
your
tongue
and
in
a
twinkling
the
thing
was
done
but
please
do
not
you
do
that
with
the
envelopes
my
father
and
send
you
many
kind
messages
yours
sincerely
schmidt
xxvi
jena
april
dear
anstruther
no
i
do
not
in
the
least
mind
your
writing
to
me
do
whenever
you
feel
you
want
to
talk
to
a
friend
it
is
pleasant
to
be
told
that
my
letters
remind
you
of
so
many
nice
things
i
expect
your
year
in
jena
seems
much
more
agreeable
now
that
you
have
had
time
to
forget
the
uncomfortable
parts
of
it
than
it
really
was
but
i
think
you
would
have
been
able
to
endure
it
if
you
had
not
been
working
so
hard
i
am
sorry
you
do
not
like
your
father
you
say
so
straight
out
so
i
see
no
reason
for
i
expect
he
will
be
calmer
when
you
are
married
why
do
you
not
gratify
him
and
have
a
short
engagement
yes
i
do
understand
what
you
feel
about
the
mercifulness
of
being
often
left
alone
though
i
have
never
been
worried
in
quite
the
same
way
as
you
seem
to
be
when
i
am
driven
it
is
to
places
like
the
kitchen
and
your
complaint
is
that
you
are
driven
to
what
most
people
would
call
enjoying
yourself
really
i
think
my
sort
of
driving
is
best
there
is
so
much
satisfaction
about
work
about
any
work
but
just
to
amuse
oneself
and
to
be
besides
in
a
perpetual
hurry
over
it
because
there
is
so
much
of
it
and
the
day
ca
be
made
to
stretch
must
be
a
sorry
business
i
wonder
why
you
do
it
you
say
your
father
insists
on
your
going
everywhere
with
the
cheritons
and
the
cheritons
will
not
miss
a
thing
but
after
all
is
it
rather
weak
to
let
yourself
be
led
round
by
the
nose
if
your
nose
does
like
it
it
is
as
though
instead
of
a
dog
wagging
its
tail
the
tail
should
wag
the
dog
and
all
nature
surely
would
stand
aghast
before
such
an
improper
spectacle
the
wind
is
icy
and
the
snow
patches
are
actually
still
here
but
in
the
nearest
garden
i
can
get
to
i
saw
violets
yesterday
in
flower
and
crocuses
and
scillas
and
one
yellow
pansy
staring
up
at
the
sun
astonished
and
reproachful
because
it
had
bits
of
frozen
snow
stuck
to
its
little
cheeks
dear
me
it
is
a
wonderful
feeling
this
resurrection
every
year
does
one
ever
grow
too
old
i
wonder
to
thrill
over
it
i
know
the
blackbirds
are
whistling
in
the
orchards
if
i
could
only
get
to
them
and
my
father
says
the
larks
have
been
out
in
the
bare
places
for
these
last
four
weeks
on
days
like
this
when
one
immortality
is
racing
along
one
blood
how
impossible
it
is
to
think
of
death
as
the
end
of
everything
and
as
for
being
grudging
and
disagreeable
the
thing
not
to
be
done
peevishness
and
an
april
morning
why
even
my
opened
her
window
today
and
stood
for
a
long
time
in
the
sun
watching
how
april
dressed
in
all
his
trim
hath
put
a
spirit
of
youth
in
everything
the
first
part
of
the
month
with
us
is
generally
bustling
and
busy
a
great
clatter
and
hustling
while
the
shrieking
winter
is
got
away
out
of
sight
over
the
hills
a
sweeping
of
the
world
clear
for
the
and
daffodils
a
diligent
making
of
room
for
the
divine
calms
of
may
i
always
loved
this
first
wild
frolic
of
cold
winds
and
catkins
and
hurriedly
crimsoning
pollards
of
bleakness
and
promise
of
roughness
and
sweetness
a
blow
on
one
cheek
and
a
kiss
on
the
other
before
the
spring
has
learned
good
manners
before
it
has
left
off
being
anything
but
a
boisterous
naughty
charming
but
this
year
after
having
been
ill
so
long
it
is
more
than
love
it
is
passion
only
people
who
have
been
buried
in
beds
for
weeks
getting
used
to
listening
for
death
step
on
the
stairs
know
what
it
is
to
go
out
into
the
stinging
freshness
of
the
young
year
and
meet
the
first
scilla
and
hear
a
chaffinch
calling
out
and
feel
the
sun
burn
red
patches
of
life
on
their
silly
sick
white
faces
my
parents
send
you
kind
remembrances
they
were
extremely
interested
to
hear
through
professor
martens
of
your
engagement
to
miss
cheriton
they
both
think
it
a
most
excellent
thing
yours
sincerely
schmidt
xxvii
jena
april
dear
anstruther
you
tell
me
i
do
not
answer
your
letters
but
really
i
think
i
do
quite
often
enough
i
want
to
make
the
most
of
these
weeks
of
idle
getting
strong
again
and
it
is
a
sad
waste
of
time
writing
my
has
had
such
a
dose
of
me
sick
and
incapable
of
doctor
bills
and
physic
and
and
that
she
is
prolonging
the
convalescent
period
quite
beyond
its
just
limits
and
will
have
me
do
nothing
lest
i
should
do
too
much
so
i
spend
strange
glorious
days
days
strange
and
glorious
to
me
with
nothing
to
do
for
anybody
but
myself
and
a
clear
conscience
to
do
it
with
the
single
sanction
of
my
approval
has
been
enough
to
clear
my
conscience
from
which
you
will
see
how
illogically
consciences
can
be
cleared
for
have
i
not
always
been
sure
she
has
no
idea
whatever
of
what
is
really
good
yet
just
her
approval
a
thing
i
know
to
be
faulty
and
for
ever
in
the
wrong
place
is
sufficient
to
prop
up
my
conscience
and
make
it
feel
secure
how
then
while
i
am
busy
reading
jane
austen
and
fanny
burney
and
maria
edgeworth
books
foreordained
from
all
time
for
the
delight
of
persons
getting
well
shall
i
find
time
to
write
to
you
and
you
must
forgive
me
for
a
certain
surprise
that
you
should
have
time
to
write
so
much
to
me
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
these
long
letters
how
many
foreign
office
envelopes
do
you
leave
ungummed
to
write
them
ist
zu
viel
it
is
very
good
of
you
no
i
will
not
make
phrases
like
that
for
i
know
you
do
not
do
it
for
any
reason
whatever
but
because
you
happen
to
want
to
you
are
going
through
one
of
those
tiresome
that
periodically
overtake
the
too
comfortable
and
you
must
apparently
tell
somebody
about
it
well
it
is
a
form
of
and
only
afflicts
the
pray
do
not
suppose
that
i
am
insinuating
that
food
is
of
undue
interest
to
you
but
it
is
true
that
if
you
did
not
have
several
meals
a
day
and
all
of
them
too
nice
if
there
were
doubts
about
their
regular
recurrence
if
briefly
you
were
a
washerwoman
or
a
you
would
not
have
things
the
matter
with
your
soul
washerwomen
and
ploughboys
do
not
have
sick
souls
probably
you
will
say
they
have
no
souls
to
be
sick
but
they
have
you
know
i
imagine
their
souls
thin
and
threadbare
stunted
by
cold
and
hunger
poor
and
pitiful
but
certainly
there
and
i
do
know
that
it
is
not
a
nicer
sort
of
soul
to
have
inside
one
plodding
body
than
an
unwieldy
overgrown
thing
chiefly
water
and
air
and
lightly
changeable
stuff
so
unsubstantial
that
it
flops
forgive
the
word
but
it
does
flop
on
to
other
souls
in
search
of
sympathy
and
support
and
comfort
and
all
the
rest
of
the
things
waste
no
time
looking
for
because
they
know
they
would
find
them
you
are
a
poet
and
i
do
not
take
a
youthful
poet
seriously
but
if
you
were
not
i
would
laugh
derisively
at
your
comparing
the
entrance
of
my
letters
into
your
room
at
the
foreign
office
to
the
bringing
in
of
a
bunch
of
cottage
flowers
still
fresh
with
dew
i
do
know
that
my
pride
does
not
rather
demand
a
comparison
to
a
bunch
of
flowers
a
bouquet
it
would
become
then
would
it
or
my
romantic
sense
to
a
bunch
of
field
flowers
wild
graceful
easily
wearied
things
that
would
not
care
at
all
for
foreign
offices
but
i
expect
cottage
is
really
the
word
my
letters
conjure
up
homely
visions
and
i
am
sure
the
bunch
you
see
is
a
tight
posy
of
with
their
homely
cottage
smell
it
was
charming
of
matthew
arnold
to
let
have
such
a
nice
line
but
i
do
think
they
quite
deserve
it
they
have
a
dear
little
name
and
a
dear
little
smell
but
the
things
themselves
might
have
been
manufactured
in
a
berlin
furniture
shop
where
upholstery
in
plush
prevails
instead
of
made
in
that
sweetest
corner
of
heaven
from
whence
all
good
flowers
come
yours
sincerely

jena
april
dear
anstruther
you
seem
to
be
incurably
doleful
you
talk
about
how
nice
it
must
be
to
have
a
sister
a
mother
some
woman
very
closely
related
to
whom
you
could
talk
you
astonish
me
for
have
you
not
miss
cheriton
still
on
reflection
i
think
i
do
see
that
what
you
feel
you
want
is
more
a
solid
sort
of
relationship
no
sentiment
genial
good
advice
a
helping
hand
if
not
a
guiding
one
really
a
good
thick
slice
of
as
a
to
a
diet
of
constant
cake
i
can
read
between
your
lines
with
sufficient
clearness
and
as
i
always
had
a
certain
talent
for
stodginess
i
will
waste
no
words
but
offer
myself
as
the
somehow
i
think
it
might
work
out
my
soul
release
from
and
doubts
if
i
can
help
you
as
far
as
one
creature
can
help
another
over
some
of
the
more
tiresome
places
of
life
exhortation
admonishment
encouragement
you
shall
have
them
all
if
you
like
by
letter
in
these
my
days
of
dignified
leisure
i
have
had
room
to
think
and
so
have
learned
to
look
at
things
differently
from
the
way
i
used
to
life
is
so
short
that
there
is
hardly
time
for
anything
except
to
be
as
paul
says
it
st
paul
kind
to
one
another
you
are
i
think
a
most
weak
person
anything
more
easily
delighted
in
the
first
place
or
more
quickly
tired
in
the
second
i
never
in
my
life
saw
does
nothing
satisfy
you
for
more
than
a
day
or
two
and
the
enthusiasm
of
you
at
the
beginnings
of
things
and
the
depression
the
despair
of
you
once
you
have
got
used
to
them
i
know
you
are
clever
full
of
brains
intellectually
all
that
can
be
desired
but
what
the
good
of
that
when
the
rest
of
you
is
so
weak
you
are
of
a
diseased
fastidiousness
there
not
a
person
you
have
praised
to
me
whom
you
have
not
later
on
disliked
when
you
were
here
i
used
to
wonder
as
i
listened
but
i
did
believe
you
now
i
know
that
the
world
can
not
possibly
contain
so
many
offensive
people
and
that
it
is
always
so
with
you
violent
heat
freezing
cold
i
can
not
see
you
drown
without
holding
out
a
hand
for
you
are
young
you
are
in
the
parts
outside
your
strange
emotions
most
full
of
promise
and
circumstances
have
knitted
me
into
an
unalterable
friend
perhaps
i
can
help
you
to
a
greater
a
greater
compactness
of
soul
but
do
not
tell
me
too
much
do
not
put
me
in
an
inextricably
difficult
position
it
would
not
of
course
be
really
inextricable
for
i
would
extricate
myself
by
the
simple
process
of
relapsing
into
silence
i
say
this
because
your
letters
have
a
growing
tendency
to
pour
out
everything
you
happen
to
be
feeling
that
in
itself
is
not
a
bad
thing
but
you
must
rightly
choose
your
listener
not
every
one
should
be
allowed
to
listen
certain
things
can
not
be
shouted
out
from
the
housetops
you
forget
that
we
hardly
know
each
other
and
that
the
do
not
thrust
their
deeper
feelings
on
a
person
who
shrinks
from
them
i
hope
you
understand
that
i
am
willing
to
hear
you
talk
about
most
things
and
that
you
will
need
no
further
warning
to
keep
off
the
few
swampy
places
and
just
think
of
all
the
things
you
can
write
to
me
about
all
the
masses
of
breathlessly
interesting
things
in
this
breathlessly
interesting
world
without
talking
about
people
at
all
look
round
you
this
fine
spring
weather
and
tell
me
for
instance
what
april
is
doing
up
your
way
and
whether
as
you
go
to
your
work
through
the
park
you
too
have
not
seen
heavy
saturn
laughing
and
leaping
how
that
sonnet
has
got
into
my
head
and
do
not
every
day
thank
god
for
having
bothered
to
make
you
at
all
yours
sincerely
schmidt
xxix
jena
april
dear
anstruther
you
know
the
little
strip
of
balcony
outside
our
window
with
its
view
over
the
trees
of
the
paradies
valley
to
the
beautiful
hills
across
the
river
well
this
morning
is
so
fine
the
sun
is
shining
so
warmly
that
i
had
my
coffee
and
roll
there
and
now
wrapped
up
in
rugs
am
still
there
writing
to
you
i
ca
tell
you
how
wonderful
it
is
the
birds
are
drunk
with
joy
there
are
blackbirds
and
thrushes
and
chaffinches
and
all
shouting
at
once
and
every
now
and
then
when
the
clamor
has
a
gap
in
it
i
hear
the
whistle
of
the
great
tit
the
dear
small
bird
who
is
the
very
first
to
sing
bringing
its
pipe
of
hope
to
those
early
days
in
february
when
the
world
is
at
its
blackest
have
you
noticed
how
different
one
morning
coffee
tastes
out
of
doors
from
what
it
does
in
a
room
and
the
roll
and
butter
oh
the
roll
and
butter
so
must
rolls
and
butter
have
tasted
in
the
youth
of
the
world
when
gods
and
mortals
were
gloriously
mixed
up
together
and
you
went
for
walks
on
exquisite
things
like
parsley
and
violets
if
thoreau
i
know
you
do
like
him
but
that
only
because
you
have
read
and
believed
stevenson
about
him
could
have
seen
the
eager
interest
with
which
i
ate
my
roll
just
now
he
would
i
am
afraid
have
been
disgusted
for
he
severely
says
that
it
is
not
what
you
eat
but
the
spirit
in
which
you
eat
it
you
are
not
that
is
to
like
it
too
much
that
turns
you
into
a
glutton
it
is
he
says
neither
the
quality
nor
the
quantity
but
the
devotion
to
sensual
savors
that
makes
your
eating
horrid
a
puritan
he
says
may
go
to
his
brown
bread
crust
with
as
gross
an
appetite
as
ever
an
alderman
to
his
turtle
thus
did
i
go
as
grossly
as
the
grossest
alderman
this
morning
to
my
crust
and
rejoiced
in
the
sensual
savor
of
it
and
was
very
glad
how
nice
it
is
how
pleasant
not
to
be
with
people
you
admire
admiration
veneration
the
best
form
of
love
they
are
all
more
comfortably
indulged
in
from
a
distance
there
is
too
much
whalebone
about
them
at
close
quarters
with
their
object
too
much
whalebone
and
not
nearly
enough
slippers
i
am
glad
thoreau
is
dead
i
love
him
far
too
much
ever
to
want
to
see
him
and
how
thankful
i
am
he
can
not
see
me
it
is
my
birthday
and
trusted
friends
have
been
streaming
up
our
three
flights
of
stairs
since
quite
early
to
bring
her
hyacinths
in
pots
and
unhappy
roses
spiked
on
wires
and
make
her
congratulatory
speeches
i
hear
them
talking
through
the
open
window
and
what
they
say
wafted
out
to
me
here
in
the
sun
sounds
like
the
pleasant
droning
of
bees
when
one
is
only
half
awake
first
there
is
the
distant
electric
bell
and
the
tempestuous
whirl
of
johanna
down
the
passage
then
my
emerges
from
the
kitchen
and
meets
the
arriving
friend
with
vociferous
welcoming
then
the
friend
is
led
into
the
room
here
talking
in
gasps
as
we
all
do
on
getting
to
the
top
of
this
house
and
flinging
cascades
of
good
wishes
for
her
on
to
the
head
then
the
hyacinths
or
the
roses
are
presented
have
brought
thee
a
small
thing
says
the
friend
presenting
and
my
who
has
been
aware
of
their
presence
the
whole
time
but
with
careful
decency
has
avoided
looking
at
them
starts
protests
and
launches
forth
on
to
heaving
billows
of
enthusiasm
she
does
not
care
for
flowers
either
in
pots
or
on
wires
or
in
any
other
condition
so
her
gratitude
is
really
most
creditably
done
then
they
settle
down
in
the
corners
of
the
sofa
and
talk
about
the
things
they
really
want
to
talk
about
neighbors
food
servants
pastors
illnesses
providence
beginning
since
i
was
ill
with
a
perfunctory
inquiry
from
the
visitor
as
to
the
health
of
says
my
you
know
in
germany
whenever
anybody
asks
after
anybody
you
have
to
begin
your
answer
with
sometimes
the
results
are
odd
for
instance
is
your
poor
husband
today
he
is
dead
so
my
too
says
and
then
i
hear
a
murmur
of
further
information
and
catch
the
word
then
they
talk
still
in
murmurs
not
supposed
to
be
able
to
get
through
the
open
window
and
into
my
ears
about
the
quantity
of
i
have
consumed
the
length
of
the
chemist
bill
the
unfortunate
circumstance
that
i
am
so
overgrown
says
my
you
call
her
weedy
says
the
friend
with
a
show
of
polite
hesitation
repeats
my
emphatically
and
the
friend
remarks
quite
seriously
that
when
a
person
is
so
very
long
there
is
always
some
part
of
her
bound
to
be
in
a
draught
and
catching
cold
is
such
a
pity
concludes
the
friend
she
did
not
marry
notice
the
tense
half
a
dozen
birthdays
back
it
used
to
be
not
says
my
not
care
for
her
murmurs
the
friend
gott
says
my
what
is
to
be
done
i
have
invited
gentlemen
in
past
days
i
have
invited
them
to
coffees
to
beer
evenings
to
music
on
sunday
afternoons
to
the
reading
aloud
of
schiller
dramas
each
with
his
part
and
with
the
heroine
and
though
they
came
they
also
went
away
again
nothing
was
changed
except
the
size
of
my
beer
bill
no
no
gentlemen
do
not
care
for
her
in
society
she
does
not
please
says
the
friend
again
and
the
out
in
the
sun
laughs
profanely
into
her
furs
the
fact
is
it
is
quite
extraordinary
the
effect
my
illness
has
had
on
me
i
thought
it
was
bad
and
i
see
it
was
good
beyond
words
ghastly
at
the
time
terrible
hopeless
the
aches
of
my
body
as
nothing
compared
with
the
amazing
anguish
of
my
soul
the
world
turned
into
one
vast
pit
of
pain
impossible
to
think
of
the
future
impossible
to
think
of
the
past
impossible
to
bear
the
present
after
all
that
behold
me
awake
again
and
so
wide
awake
with
eyes
grown
so
quick
to
see
the
wonder
and
importance
of
the
little
things
of
life
the
beauty
of
them
the
joy
of
them
that
i
can
laugh
aloud
with
glee
at
the
delicious
notion
of
calling
me
an
three
months
ago
with
what
miserable
groanings
what
infinite
i
would
have
agreed
now
clear
of
vision
i
see
how
many
precious
gifts
i
have
life
and
freedom
from
pain
and
time
to
be
used
and
enjoyed
gifts
no
one
can
take
from
me
except
god
do
you
know
any
george
herbert
he
was
one
of
the
many
english
poets
my
mother
love
of
poetry
made
me
read
do
you
remember
i
once
more
smell
the
dew
the
rain
and
relish
versing
o
my
only
light
it
can
not
be
that
i
am
he
on
whom
thy
tempests
fell
all
night
well
that
is
how
i
feel
full
of
wonder
and
an
unspeakable
relief
it
is
so
strange
how
bad
things
things
we
call
bad
bring
forth
good
things
from
the
manure
that
brings
forth
roses
lovely
in
proportion
to
its
manuriness
to
the
worst
experiences
that
can
overtake
the
soul
and
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
see
which
is
not
very
far
for
i
know
i
am
not
a
clever
woman
it
is
also
true
that
good
things
bring
forth
bad
ones
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
life
surprises
me
i
never
get
used
to
it
i
never
tire
of
pondering
and
watching
and
wondering
the
way
in
which
eternal
truths
lurk
along
one
path
lie
among
the
potatoes
in
cellars
did
you
ever
observe
the
conduct
of
potatoes
in
cellars
their
desperate
determination
to
reach
up
to
the
light
their
absolute
concentration
on
that
one
distant
glimmer
peep
out
at
one
from
every
apparently
dull
corner
sit
among
the
stones
hang
upon
the
bushes
come
into
one
room
in
the
morning
with
the
hot
water
come
out
at
night
in
heaven
with
the
stars
never
leave
us
touch
us
press
upon
us
if
we
choose
to
open
our
eyes
and
look
and
our
ears
and
listen
how
extraordinary
it
is
can
one
be
bored
in
a
world
so
wonderful
and
then
the
keen
interest
there
is
to
be
got
out
of
people
the
keen
joy
to
be
got
out
of
common
affections
the
delight
of
having
a
fresh
day
every
morning
before
you
a
fresh
long
day
bare
and
empty
to
be
filled
as
you
pass
along
it
with
nothing
but
clean
and
noble
hours
you
must
forgive
this
exuberance
the
sun
has
got
into
my
veins
and
has
turned
everything
golden
yours
sincerely
schmidt
xxx
jena
may
dear
anstruther
how
can
i
help
it
if
things
look
golden
to
me
you
almost
reproach
me
for
it
you
seem
to
think
it
selfish
and
talk
of
the
beauty
of
sympathy
with
persons
less
fortunately
constituted
that
a
gray
sort
of
beauty
the
beauty
of
mists
and
rains
and
tears
i
wish
you
could
have
been
in
the
meadows
across
the
river
this
morning
and
seen
the
dandelions
there
was
not
much
grayness
about
them
from
the
bridge
to
the
you
know
that
is
a
long
way
at
least
twenty
minutes
walk
they
are
one
sheet
of
gold
if
you
had
been
there
before
breakfast
with
your
feet
on
that
divine
carpet
and
your
head
in
the
nickering
slight
shadows
of
the
first
willow
leaves
and
your
eyes
on
the
shining
masses
of
slow
white
clouds
and
your
ears
filled
with
the
fresh
sound
of
the
river
and
your
nose
filled
with
the
smell
of
young
wet
things
you
would
have
wanted
to
think
much
about
such
gray
negations
as
sympathizing
with
the
gloomy
bother
the
gloomy
they
are
an
ungrateful
set
if
they
can
they
will
turn
the
whole
world
sour
and
sap
up
all
the
happiness
of
the
children
of
light
without
giving
out
any
shining
in
return
i
am
all
for
sun
and
heat
and
color
and
scent
for
all
things
radiant
and
positive
if
crushing
down
my
own
nature
i
set
out
deliberately
to
console
those
you
call
the
less
fortunately
constituted
do
you
know
what
would
happen
they
would
wring
me
quite
dry
of
cheerfulness
and
not
be
one
whit
more
cheerful
for
all
the
wringing
themselves
they
ca
they
were
not
made
that
way
people
are
born
in
one
of
three
classes
children
of
light
children
of
twilight
children
of
night
and
how
can
they
help
into
which
class
they
are
born
but
i
do
think
the
twilight
children
can
by
diligence
by
if
you
like
prayer
and
fasting
come
out
of
the
dusk
into
a
greater
brightness
only
they
must
come
out
by
themselves
there
must
be
no
pulling
i
do
at
all
agree
with
your
notion
of
the
efficacy
of
being
pulled
do
you
then
know
of
course
you
do
but
you
have
not
yet
realized
that
you
are
to
seek
the
kingdom
of
god
and
his
righteousness
and
all
these
things
shall
be
added
unto
you
and
do
you
know
oh
have
you
forgotten
that
the
kingdom
of
god
is
within
you
so
what
is
the
use
of
looking
to
anything
outside
of
you
and
separated
from
you
for
help
there
is
no
help
except
what
you
dig
out
of
your
own
self
and
if
i
could
make
you
see
that
i
would
have
shown
you
all
the
secrets
of
life
how
wisely
i
talk
it
is
the
wisdom
of
the
grass
the
good
green
grass
the
grass
starred
with
living
beauty
that
has
got
into
me
the
wisdom
of
a
may
morning
filled
with
present
joy
of
the
joy
of
the
moment
without
any
weakening
waste
of
looking
beyond
so
mock
i
ca
help
it
do
you
then
want
to
be
pitied
i
will
pity
you
if
you
like
in
so
many
carefully
chosen
words
but
they
will
not
be
words
from
the
heart
but
only
as
the
charming
little
child
in
the
flat
below
us
the
child
with
the
flaunting
yellow
hair
and
audacious
eyes
said
of
some
speech
that
did
ring
true
to
her
quick
ears
the
tip
of
the
nose
i
can
not
really
pity
you
you
know
you
are
too
healthy
too
young
too
fortunate
for
that
you
ought
to
be
quite
jubilant
with
cheerfullest
gratitude
and
since
you
are
not
you
very
perfectly
illustrate
the
truth
of
being
du
or
if
you
prefer
your
clumsier
mother
tongue
of
the
half
being
better
than
the
whole
how
is
it
that
i
bereft
of
everything
you
think
worth
having
am
so
offensively
cheerful
your
friends
would
call
it
a
sordid
existence
if
they
considered
it
with
anything
more
lengthy
than
just
a
sniff
no
excitements
no
clothes
acquaintances
so
shabby
that
they
seem
almost
the
days
filled
with
the
same
dull
round
a
home
in
a
little
town
where
we
all
get
into
one
groove
and
having
got
into
it
stay
in
it
to
which
only
faint
echoes
come
of
what
is
going
on
in
the
world
outside
a
place
where
one
is
amused
and
entertained
by
things
concerts
plays
and
feels
oneself
grow
cultured
by
attendance
at
meetings
would
you
not
think
i
must
starve
in
such
a
place
but
i
do
my
soul
does
dream
of
starving
in
fact
i
am
quite
anxious
about
it
it
has
lately
grown
so
fat
there
is
so
little
outside
it
for
the
concerts
plays
debates
social
gatherings
are
dust
and
ashes
near
which
i
do
not
go
that
it
eagerly
turns
to
what
is
inside
it
and
finds
itself
full
of
magic
forces
of
heat
and
light
forces
hot
and
burning
enough
to
set
every
common
bush
afire
with
god
that
is
elizabeth
barrett
browning
i
mean
about
the
common
bushes
a
slightly
mutilated
elizabeth
barrett
browning
but
still
a
quotation
and
if
you
do
not
happen
to
know
it
i
wo
have
you
go
about
thinking
it
pure
schmidt
ought
i
if
i
quote
to
warn
you
of
the
fact
by
the
pointing
fingers
of
inverted
commas
i
care
to
somehow
they
make
such
a
show
of
importance
i
prefer
to
suppose
you
cultured
oh
i
can
see
you
shiver
at
that
impertinence
for
i
know
down
in
your
heart
though
you
always
take
pains
to
explain
how
ignorant
you
are
you
consider
yourself
an
extremely
cultured
young
man
and
so
you
are
cultured
i
should
say
out
of
all
reason
so
much
cultured
that
there
hardly
anything
left
that
you
are
able
to
like
indeed
it
is
surprising
that
you
should
care
to
write
to
a
rough
unscraped
sort
of
person
like
myself
do
not
my
crudities
set
your
teeth
on
edge
as
acutely
as
the
juice
of
a
very
green
apple
you
who
love
half
tones
subtleties
suggestions
who
lifting
the
merest
fringe
of
things
approach
them
nearer
only
by
infinite
implications
what
have
you
to
do
with
the
downrightness
of
an
east
wind
or
a
green
apple
why
i
wonder
that
just
the
recollection
of
my
red
hands
knobbly
and
spread
with
work
does
not
make
you
wince
into
aloofness
and
my
clothes
what
about
my
clothes
do
you
not
like
exquisite
women
perfectly
women
fresh
and
dainty
constantly
renewed
women
it
is
two
years
since
i
had
a
new
hat
and
as
for
the
dress
that
sees
me
through
my
days
i
really
can
not
count
the
time
since
it
started
in
my
company
a
sunday
and
a
garment
if
you
were
once
only
once
to
see
me
in
the
middle
of
your
friends
over
there
you
would
be
cured
for
ever
of
wanting
to
write
to
me
i
belong
to
your
jena
days
days
of
hard
living
and
working
and
thinking
days
when
by
dint
of
being
forced
to
do
without
certain
bodily
comforts
the
accommodating
spirit
made
up
for
it
by
its
own
increased
comfort
and
warmth
probably
your
spirit
will
never
again
attain
to
quite
so
bright
a
shining
as
it
did
that
year
how
can
it
unless
it
is
amazingly
strong
and
i
know
it
well
not
to
be
that
shine
through
the
suffocating
masses
of
upholstery
your
present
life
piles
about
it
poor
spirit
at
least
see
to
it
that
its
flicker
does
quite
go
out
to
urge
you
to
strip
your
life
of
all
this
embroidery
and
let
it
get
the
draught
of
air
it
needs
would
be
i
know
mere
waste
of
ink
my
people
send
you
every
good
wish
yours
sincerely
schmidt
xxxi
jena
may
dear
anstruther
of
course
i
am
full
of
contradictions
did
you
expect
me
to
be
full
of
anything
else
and
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
in
every
letter
i
say
exactly
the
opposite
from
what
i
said
in
the
last
one
but
you
must
not
mind
this
and
make
it
an
occasion
for
reproof
i
do
not
pretend
to
think
quite
the
same
even
two
days
running
if
i
did
i
would
be
stagnant
and
the
very
essence
of
life
is
to
be
fluid
to
pass
perpetually
on
so
please
do
not
hold
me
responsible
for
convictions
that
i
have
changed
by
the
time
they
get
to
you
and
above
all
things
do
bring
them
up
against
me
and
ask
me
to
prove
them
i
do
want
to
prove
them
i
do
want
to
prove
anything
my
attitude
toward
life
is
one
of
wonder
and
delight
and
the
can
not
talk
you
write
too
plaintively
that
some
of
the
things
i
say
hurt
you
i
am
sorry
sorry
i
mean
that
you
should
be
so
soft
can
you
not
then
bear
anything
but
i
will
smooth
my
tongue
if
you
prefer
it
smooth
and
send
you
envelopes
filled
with
only
sugar
talk
to
you
about
the
parks
the
london
season
the
foreign
office
all
things
of
which
i
know
nothing
and
patting
you
at
short
intervals
on
the
back
tell
you
you
are
admirable
you
say
there
is
a
bitter
flavor
about
some
of
my
remarks
i
have
not
felt
bitter
perhaps
a
little
shrewish
a
little
like
not
a
mild
exhorting
elder
sister
but
an
irritated
aunt
you
see
i
am
interested
enough
in
you
to
be
fidgety
when
i
hear
you
groan
what
i
ask
myself
uneasily
can
be
the
matter
with
this
apparently
healthy
young
man
and
then
forced
to
the
conclusion
by
unmistakable
symptoms
that
there
is
nothing
the
matter
except
a
surfeit
of
good
things
i
have
perhaps
pounced
upon
you
with
something
of
the
zeal
of
an
aunt
moved
to
anger
and
given
you
a
spiritual
slapping
you
sighed
for
a
sister
you
are
always
sighing
for
something
and
asked
me
to
be
one
well
i
have
apparently
gone
beyond
the
sister
in
decision
and
authority
and
developed
something
of
the
acerbity
of
an
aunt
so
you
are
down
at
clinches
how
beautiful
it
must
be
there
this
month
i
think
of
it
as
a
harmony
in
gray
and
amethyst
remembering
your
description
of
it
the
first
time
you
went
there
a
harmony
in
a
minor
key
that
captured
you
wholly
by
its
tender
subtleties
when
i
think
of
you
inheriting
such
a
place
later
on
through
your
wife
i
do
from
my
heart
feel
that
your
engagement
is
an
excellent
thing
she
must
indeed
be
happy
in
the
knowledge
that
she
can
give
you
so
much
that
is
absolutely
worth
having
it
is
beautiful
beautiful
to
give
one
of
the
very
most
beautiful
things
in
life
i
quarrel
with
my
poverty
only
because
i
can
give
so
little
so
seldom
and
then
never
more
than
ridiculous
small
trumperies
to
make
up
for
them
i
try
to
give
as
much
of
myself
as
possible
gifts
of
sympathy
helpfulness
kindness
laugh
but
i
am
practicing
on
my
it
is
easy
to
pour
out
love
on
papa
so
easy
so
effortless
that
i
do
not
feel
as
if
it
could
be
worth
much
but
i
have
made
up
my
mind
not
without
something
of
a
grim
determination
that
seems
to
have
little
enough
to
do
with
love
to
give
my
as
much
of
me
my
affections
my
services
as
she
can
do
with
perhaps
she
wo
be
able
to
do
with
much
anyhow
all
she
wants
she
shall
have
you
know
i
have
often
wished
i
had
been
a
man
able
to
pull
on
my
boots
and
go
out
into
the
wide
world
without
let
or
hindrance
but
for
one
thing
i
am
glad
to
be
a
woman
and
that
one
thing
is
that
the
woman
gives
it
is
so
far
less
wonderful
to
take
the
man
is
always
taking
the
woman
always
giving
and
giving
so
wonderfully
in
the
face
sometimes
of
dreadful
disaster
of
shipwreck
of
death
which
explains
perhaps
her
longer
persistence
in
clinging
to
the
skirts
of
a
passion
for
is
not
the
tenderer
feeling
on
the
side
of
the
one
who
gave
and
blessed
always
always
on
that
side
mixing
into
what
was
sensual
some
of
the
dear
divineness
of
the
i
think
i
could
never
grow
wholly
indifferent
to
a
person
to
whom
i
had
given
much
he
or
she
would
not
could
not
be
the
same
to
me
as
other
people
time
would
pass
and
the
growing
number
of
the
days
blunt
the
first
sharp
edge
of
feeling
but
the
memory
of
what
i
had
given
would
bind
us
together
in
a
friendship
for
ever
unlike
any
other
i
have
not
thanked
you
for
the
book
you
sent
me
it
was
very
kind
indeed
of
you
to
wish
me
to
share
the
pleasure
you
have
had
in
reading
it
but
see
how
unfortunately
contrary
i
am
i
do
care
about
it
and
just
the
passages
you
marked
are
the
ones
i
care
about
least
i
do
not
hold
with
markings
in
books
whenever
i
have
come
across
mine
after
a
lapse
of
years
i
have
marvelled
at
the
distance
travelled
since
i
marked
and
shut
up
the
book
and
murmured
fool
i
ca
imagine
why
you
thought
i
should
like
this
book
it
has
given
me
rather
a
surprised
shock
that
you
should
know
me
so
little
and
that
i
should
know
you
so
little
as
to
think
you
knew
me
better
really
all
the
explanations
and
pointings
in
the
world
will
not
show
a
person
the
exact
position
of
his
neighbor
soul
it
is
astonishing
enough
that
the
book
was
printed
but
how
infinitely
more
astonishing
that
people
like
you
should
admire
it
what
is
the
matter
with
me
that
i
can
not
admire
it
why
am
i
missing
things
that
ought
to
give
me
pleasure
you
do
not
then
see
that
it
is
dull
i
do
i
see
it
and
feel
it
in
every
bone
and
it
makes
them
ache
it
is
dull
and
bad
because
it
is
so
dreary
so
hopelessly
dreary
life
is
not
like
that
life
is
only
like
that
to
cowards
who
are
temporarily
indisposed
i
do
not
care
to
look
at
it
through
a
sick
jaundiced
eyes
and
shudder
with
him
at
what
he
sees
if
he
can
not
see
better
why
not
keep
quiet
and
let
us
braver
folk
march
along
with
our
heads
in
the
air
held
so
high
that
we
can
not
bother
to
look
at
every
slimy
creepiness
that
crawls
across
our
path
and
did
you
not
notice
how
he
keeps
on
telling
his
friends
in
his
letters
not
to
mind
when
he
is
dead
unnecessary
advice
one
would
suppose
i
can
more
easily
imagine
the
friends
gasping
with
an
infinite
relief
persons
who
are
everlastingly
claiming
pity
sympathy
condolences
are
very
wearing
surely
all
talk
about
one
death
is
selfish
and
bad
that
is
why
though
there
is
so
much
that
is
lovely
in
them
the
faint
breath
of
corruption
hanging
about
christina
rossetti
poetry
makes
me
turn
my
head
the
other
way
what
a
constant
cry
it
is
that
she
wants
to
die
that
she
hopes
to
die
that
she
going
to
die
shall
die
can
die
must
die
and
that
nobody
is
to
weep
for
her
but
that
there
are
to
be
elaborate
and
moving
arrangements
of
lilies
and
roses
and
and
at
least
in
one
place
she
gives
directions
as
to
the
proper
use
of
green
grass
and
wet
dewdrops
upon
her
grave
implying
that
dewdrops
are
sometimes
dry
i
think
the
only
decent
attitude
toward
one
death
is
to
be
silent
talk
about
it
puts
other
people
in
such
an
awkward
position
what
is
one
to
say
to
persons
who
sigh
and
tell
us
that
they
will
no
doubt
soon
be
in
heaven
one
instinct
is
politely
to
murmur
no
and
then
they
are
angry
not
also
has
its
pitfalls
cheery
words
of
the
order
in
speech
that
a
slap
on
the
shoulder
is
in
the
sphere
of
physical
expression
only
seem
to
deepen
the
determined
gloom
and
if
it
is
some
one
you
love
who
thinks
he
will
soon
be
dead
and
tells
you
so
the
cruelty
is
very
great
when
death
really
comes
is
not
what
the
ordinary
decent
dier
wants
quiet
that
he
may
leave
himself
utterly
in
the
hands
of
god
there
should
be
no
massing
of
temporarily
onlookers
about
his
bed
no
and
eager
of
last
words
no
revellings
of
relatives
in
the
voluptuousness
of
woe
no
futile
exhortations
using
up
the
last
poor
breaths
not
to
weep
to
persons
who
would
consider
it
highly
improper
to
leave
off
doing
it
and
no
administration
of
tardy
blessings
any
blessings
the
dier
has
to
invoke
should
have
been
invoked
and
done
with
long
ago
in
this
last
hour
at
least
can
one
not
be
left
alone
do
you
remember
pater
strange
feeling
about
death
perhaps
you
do
not
for
you
told
me
once
you
did
not
care
about
him
well
it
runs
through
his
books
through
all
their
serenity
and
sunlight
through
exquisite
descriptions
of
summer
of
beautiful
places
of
heat
and
life
and
youth
and
all
things
lovely
like
a
musty
black
riband
very
poor
very
mean
very
rotten
that
yet
must
bind
these
gracious
flowers
of
light
at
last
together
bruising
them
into
one
piteous
mass
of
corruption
it
is
all
very
morbid
the
fair
outward
surface
of
daily
life
the
gay
crust
of
earth
and
just
underneath
horrible
tainted
things
things
forlorn
and
pitiful
things
which
we
who
still
walk
on
the
wholesome
grass
must
soon
join
changing
our
life
in
the
roomy
sunshine
into
something
infinitely
dependent
and
helpless
something
that
can
only
dimly
live
if
those
strong
friends
of
ours
in
the
bright
world
will
spare
us
a
thought
a
remembrance
a
few
minutes
from
their
plenty
for
sitting
beside
us
room
in
their
hearts
for
yet
a
little
love
and
sorrow
cheek
by
dead
cheek
and
the
rain
soaking
down
upon
one
from
above
does
not
that
sound
hopeless
after
reading
these
things
sweet
with
the
tainted
sweetness
of
decay
of
ruin
of
the
past
the
gone
it
is
like
having
fresh
spring
water
dashed
over
one
on
a
languid
afternoon
to
remember
walt
whitman
brave
attitude
toward
death
sacred
knowledge
of
death
soothing
death
enfolding
death
deliveress
and
death
body
gratefully
nestling
close
to
death
and
sacred
death
that
is
the
spirit
that
makes
one
brave
and
fearless
that
makes
one
live
beautifully
and
well
that
sends
one
marching
straight
ahead
with
limbs
that
do
not
tremble
and
head
held
high
is
it
not
natural
to
love
such
writers
best
writers
who
fill
one
with
glad
courage
and
make
one
proud
of
the
path
one
has
chosen
to
walk
in
and
yet
you
do
not
like
walt
whitman
i
remember
quite
well
my
chill
of
disappointment
when
you
told
me
so
at
first
hearing
it
i
thought
i
must
be
wrong
to
like
him
but
thank
heaven
i
soon
got
my
balance
again
and
presently
was
solaced
by
the
reflection
that
it
was
at
least
as
likely
you
were
wrong
not
to
you
told
me
it
was
not
poetry
that
upset
me
for
a
few
days
and
then
i
found
i
did
care
i
could
argue
with
you
on
the
spot
and
prove
anything
because
the
only
i
have
is
that
tiresome
so
brilliant
when
it
is
too
late
so
constant
in
its
habit
of
leaving
its
possessor
in
the
dreadful
condition
or
is
it
a
place
called
the
lurch
but
poetry
or
not
i
knew
i
must
always
love
him
you
i
suppose
have
cultivated
your
taste
in
regard
to
things
of
secondary
importance
to
such
a
pitch
of
sensitiveness
that
unless
the
outer
shell
is
flawless
you
can
not
for
sheer
intellectual
discomfort
look
at
the
wonders
that
often
lie
within
i
who
have
not
been
educated
am
so
filled
with
elementary
joy
when
some
one
shows
me
the
light
in
this
world
of
many
shadows
that
i
do
not
stop
to
consider
what
were
the
words
he
used
while
my
eyes
followed
his
pointing
finger
you
see
i
try
to
console
myself
for
having
an
unpruned
intelligence
i
know
i
am
unpruned
and
that
at
the
most
you
pruned
people
all
trim
and
trained
from
the
first
do
but
bear
with
me
indulgently
but
i
must
think
with
the
apparatus
i
possess
and
i
think
at
this
moment
that
perhaps
what
you
really
most
want
is
a
prolonged
dose
of
walt
whitman
a
close
study
of
him
for
several
hours
every
day
shut
up
with
no
other
book
quite
alone
with
him
in
an
empty
country
place
listen
to
this
you
shall
listen
o
we
can
wait
no
longer
we
too
take
ship
o
soul
joyous
we
too
launch
out
on
trackless
seas
fearless
for
unknown
shores
on
waves
of
ecstasy
to
sail
amid
the
wafting
winds
thou
pressing
me
to
thee
i
thee
to
me
o
soul
carolling
free
singing
our
song
of
god
chanting
our
chant
of
pleasant
exploration
o
my
brave
soul
o
farther
farther
sail
o
daring
joy
but
safe
are
they
not
all
the
seas
of
god
o
farther
farther
sail
i
well
how
do
you
feel
now
can
any
one
can
you
can
even
you
read
that
without
such
a
tingling
in
all
your
limbs
such
a
fresh
rush
of
life
and
energy
through
your
whole
body
that
you
simply
must
jump
up
and
shaking
off
the
dreary
nonsense
that
has
been
fooling
you
turn
your
back
on
diseased
and
run
straight
out
to
work
at
your
salvation
in
the
sun
yours
sincerely
schmidt
xxxii
jena
may
dear
anstruther
i
am
sorry
you
think
me
unsympathetic
hard
i
think
was
the
word
but
unsympathetic
sounds
prettier
is
it
unsympathetic
not
to
like
fruitless
profitless
barren
things
not
to
like
fogs
and
blights
and
other
deadening
decaying
things
from
my
heart
i
pity
all
the
people
who
are
so
made
that
they
can
not
get
on
with
their
living
for
fear
of
their
dying
but
i
do
not
admire
them
is
that
being
unsympathetic
apparently
you
think
so
how
odd
there
is
a
little
man
here
who
hardly
ever
can
talk
to
anybody
without
beginning
about
his
death
he
is
perfectly
healthy
and
i
suppose
forty
or
fifty
so
that
there
is
every
reasonable
hope
of
his
going
on
being
a
little
man
for
years
and
years
more
but
he
will
have
it
that
as
he
has
never
married
or
as
he
puts
it
done
anything
else
useful
he
might
just
as
well
be
dead
and
then
at
the
word
dead
his
eyes
get
just
the
look
of
absolute
scaredness
in
them
that
a
hare
eyes
do
when
a
dog
is
after
it
only
one
knew
what
came
next
he
said
last
time
he
was
here
looking
at
me
with
those
foolish
frightened
hare
eyes
things
i
should
think
said
i
trying
to
be
encouraging
to
those
who
have
deserved
punishment
they
have
deserved
it
they
will
probably
get
it
said
i
cheerfully
he
shuddered
do
look
very
wicked
i
went
on
amiably
he
leads
a
life
of
sheerest
so
simple
so
innocent
so
full
of
little
virtues
i
am
he
declared
angrily
should
think
half
so
bad
as
a
great
many
people
said
i
bent
being
the
hostess
on
a
perfect
urbanity
said
he
more
angrily
come
now
said
i
very
politely
as
i
thought
then
he
really
got
into
a
rage
and
asked
me
what
i
could
possibly
know
about
it
and
i
said
i
did
know
anything
and
still
he
stormed
and
grew
more
and
more
like
a
terrified
hare
frightening
himself
by
his
own
words
and
at
last
dropping
his
voice
he
confessed
that
he
had
one
particularly
deadly
fear
a
fear
that
haunted
him
and
gave
him
no
rest
that
the
wicked
would
not
burn
eternally
but
would
freeze
said
i
shrinking
for
it
was
a
bitter
day
and
the
northeast
wind
was
thundering
among
the
hills
cold
he
said
fixing
me
with
his
hare
eyes
to
me
incomparably
more
terrible
than
great
heat
incomparably
i
agreed
edging
nearer
to
the
stove
listen
to
that
wind
will
it
howl
about
us
through
eternity
said
he
i
shivered
one
unprotected
everything
about
us
will
be
unprotected
then
one
unprotected
marrow
and
turning
it
to
ice
within
us
we
wo
have
any
marrows
said
i
marrows
fräulein
we
shall
have
everything
that
will
hurt
cried
i
stopping
up
my
ears
thought
frightens
you
said
he
me
said
i
much
more
fearful
then
will
be
the
reality
i
like
to
i
like
to
give
you
some
good
advice
said
i
hesitating
if
one
of
your
sex
may
with
any
efficacy
advise
one
of
ours
efficacy
murmured
i
with
proper
deprecation
i
like
to
suggest
i
dare
advise
i
just
suggest
nothing
i
am
all
ears
and
willingness
to
be
guided
said
he
smiling
with
an
indescribable
graciousness
do
go
there
go
there
while
you
are
here
still
here
and
alive
and
in
nice
warm
woolly
clothes
do
you
know
what
you
want
i
want
badly
do
you
want
a
wife
why
not
go
and
get
one
his
eyes
at
that
grew
more
than
at
the
thought
of
eternal
ice
he
seized
his
hat
and
scrambled
to
the
door
he
went
through
it
hissing
scorching
things
about
and
from
the
safety
of
the
passage
i
heard
him
call
me
he
has
been
here
since
i
would
like
to
go
and
shake
him
shake
him
till
his
brains
settle
into
their
proper
place
and
say
while
i
shake
little
man
little
man
come
out
of
the
fog
why
do
you
choose
to
die
a
thousand
deaths
rather
than
only
one
is
that
being
unsympathetic
i
think
it
is
being
quite
kind
yours
sincerely
schmidt
what
i
really
meant
to
write
to
you
about
today
was
to
tell
you
that
i
read
your
learned
and
technical
and
i
am
sure
admirable
denouncements
of
walt
whitman
with
a
respectful
attention
due
to
so
much
earnestness
and
when
i
had
done
and
wondered
awhile
pleasantly
at
the
amount
of
time
for
the
foreign
office
allows
its
young
men
i
stretched
myself
and
got
my
hat
and
went
down
to
the
river
and
i
sat
at
the
water
edge
in
the
middle
of
a
great
many
buttercups
and
there
was
a
little
wind
and
the
little
wind
knocked
the
heads
of
the
buttercups
together
and
it
seemed
to
amuse
them
or
else
something
else
did
for
i
do
assure
you
i
thought
i
heard
them
laugh
xxxiii
jena
may
dear
anstruther
you
asked
me
about
your
successor
in
our
house
and
inquire
why
i
have
never
mentioned
him
why
should
i
mention
him
must
i
mention
everything
i
suppose
i
forgot
him
his
name
is
collins
and
some
days
he
wears
a
pink
shirt
and
other
days
a
blue
shirt
and
in
his
right
cuff
there
is
a
pink
silk
handkerchief
on
the
pink
days
and
a
blue
silk
handkerchief
on
the
blue
days
and
he
has
stuck
up
the
pictures
he
likes
to
have
about
him
on
the
walls
of
his
room
and
where
your
luini
used
to
be
there
is
a
young
lady
in
a
voluminous
hat
and
short
skirts
and
where
your
bellini
madonna
sat
and
looked
at
you
with
austere
beautiful
eyes
there
is
the
winner
complete
with
jockey
of
last
year
derby
made
a
pot
of
money
over
that
said
collins
to
me
the
day
he
pinned
it
up
and
came
to
ask
me
for
the
pin
you
said
i
but
i
think
i
am
tired
just
now
of
luinis
and
bellinis
and
of
the
sort
of
spirit
in
a
young
man
that
clothes
the
walls
of
his
room
with
them
each
in
some
elaborately
simple
frame
and
am
not
at
all
sure
that
the
frank
fleshliness
of
a
collins
does
not
please
me
best
you
see
one
longs
so
much
sometimes
to
get
down
to
the
soil
down
to
plain
instincts
to
rude
nature
to
if
you
like
elemental
savagery
but
i
go
on
with
collins
you
shall
have
a
dose
of
him
while
i
am
about
it
he
has
bought
a
canoe
and
has
won
the
cup
for
swimming
wresting
it
from
the
reluctant
hands
of
the
discomfited
jena
young
men
he
paddles
up
to
the
weir
gets
out
picks
up
his
canoe
carries
it
round
to
the
other
side
gets
in
and
vanishes
in
the
windings
of
the
water
and
the
folds
of
the
hills
leaving
the
girls
in
the
you
remember
the
courts
are
opposite
the
weir
uncertain
whether
to
titter
or
to
blush
for
he
wears
i
suppose
the
fewest
clothes
that
it
is
possible
to
wear
and
still
be
called
dressed
and
no
stockings
at
all
dieser
gasp
the
girls
turning
down
decent
eyes
declare
the
young
men
got
up
in
as
near
an
imitation
of
the
flannels
you
used
to
wear
that
they
can
reach
even
their
hats
bound
about
with
a
ribbon
startlingly
like
your
oxford
half
blue
and
before
the
summer
is
over
i
dare
say
they
will
all
be
playing
tennis
in
the
collins
canoe
costume
stockingless
sleeveless
supposing
it
to
be
the
latest
in
for
each
and
every
form
of
sport
professor
martens
did
care
about
teaching
collins
and
insisted
on
handing
him
over
to
papa
papa
does
care
about
teaching
him
either
and
says
he
is
a
who
pronounces
goethe
as
though
it
rhymed
with
dirty
and
who
the
first
time
our
great
poet
was
mentioned
vacantly
asked
with
every
indication
of
a
wandering
mind
if
he
was
the
joker
who
wrote
the
play
for
irving
with
all
the
devils
in
it
papa
was
so
angry
that
he
began
a
letter
to
collins
telling
him
to
remove
his
son
to
a
city
where
there
are
fewer
muses
but
collins
is
a
person
who
makes
nails
in
manchester
with
immense
skill
and
application
and
is
terrifyingly
rich
and
my
attitude
toward
the
terrifyingly
rich
is
one
of
large
forgiveness
so
she
tore
up
papa
letter
just
where
it
had
got
to
the
words
said
he
was
a
very
decent
boy
that
he
should
stay
as
long
as
he
wanted
to
but
that
since
he
seemed
to
be
troublesome
about
learning
papa
must
write
and
demand
a
higher
scale
of
payment
papa
would
my
did
and
behold
joey
his
christian
name
is
joey
more
lucrative
to
us
by
i
believe
just
double
than
any
one
we
have
had
yet
say
said
joey
to
me
this
morning
over
to
england
some
day
and
i
romp
you
down
to
epsom
said
i
turning
up
my
eyes
have
a
rippin
time
romp
you
down
in
the
old
man
motor
really
be
there
before
you
could
flutter
an
eyelash
you
serious
i
though
it
a
you
get
them
in
london
in
london
get
what
in
london
one
go
every
time
all
the
way
to
epsom
joey
ceased
from
speech
and
began
to
stare
we
not
talking
about
salts
i
inquired
hastily
feeling
that
one
of
us
was
off
the
track
echoed
joey
his
mouth
hanging
open
mentioned
epsom
surely
did
say
epsom
did
you
said
i
becoming
very
distinct
in
the
presence
of
what
looked
like
deliberate
wilfulness
it
got
to
do
with
salts
asked
joey
his
underlip
of
a
measureless
vacancy
it
got
everything
here
what
are
you

xxxiv

dear
anstruther
i
am
sorry
not
to
have
been
able
to
answer
your
letters
for
so
many
weeks
and
sorry
that
you
should
have
been
as
you
say
uneasy
but
my
telegram
in
reply
to
yours
will
have
explained
what
has
been
happening
to
us
my
died
a
fortnight
ago
almost
immediately
after
i
wrote
last
to
you
she
began
to
be
very
my
feelings
toward
her
have
undergone
a
complete
upheaval
i
can
not
speak
of
her
she
is
revenging
herself
as
only
the
dead
in
their
utter
unresentfulness
can
revenge
themselves
for
every
hard
and
scoffing
thought
i
had
of
her
in
life
i
think
i
told
you
once
about
her
annuity
now
it
is
gone
papa
and
i
must
see
to
it
that
we
live
on
my
money
alone
it
is
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
so
the
living
will
have
to
be
prudent
not
so
prudent
i
hope
but
that
we
shall
have
everything
to
enjoy
that
is
worth
enjoying
but
quite
prudent
enough
to
force
us
to
take
thought
so
we
are
leaving
the
flat
grown
far
too
expensive
for
us
as
soon
as
we
can
find
some
other
home
we
have
almost
decided
on
one
already
collins
went
to
england
when
the
illness
grew
evidently
hopeless
and
we
shall
not
take
him
back
again
for
my
father
does
not
care
at
least
at
present
to
have
strangers
with
us
and
i
myself
do
not
feel
as
though
i
could
cook
for
and
look
after
a
young
man
in
the
way
my
did
not
having
one
will
make
us
poor
but
i
think
we
shall
be
able
to
manage
quite
well
for
we
do
not
want
much
thank
you
for
your
kind
letters
since
the
telegram
the
ones
before
that
coming
into
this
serious
house
filled
with
the
nearness
of
death
and
of
death
in
his
sternest
mood
his
hands
cruel
with
scourges
seemed
to
me
so
inexpressibly
well
i
will
not
say
it
it
is
not
fair
to
blame
you
who
could
not
know
in
whose
shadow
we
were
sitting
for
being
preoccupied
with
the
trivialities
of
living
but
letters
sent
to
friends
a
long
way
off
do
sometimes
fall
into
their
midst
with
a
rather
ghastly
clang
of
discord
it
is
what
yours
did
i
read
them
sometimes
in
the
night
watching
by
my
in
the
room
during
the
moments
when
she
had
a
little
peace
and
was
allowed
to
slip
away
from
torture
into
sleep
by
the
side
of
that
racked
figure
and
all
it
meant
and
the
tremendous
sermons
it
was
preaching
me
wordless
voiceless
sermons
more
eloquent
than
any
i
shall
hear
again
how
strange
how
your
echoes
from
life
and
the
world
seemed
distant
tinklings
of
artificialness
not
quite
genuine
writhings
beneath
not
quite
genuine
burdens
idle
questionings
and
plaints
doubts
and
complicated
reproaches
of
myself
that
i
should
be
able
to
be
pleased
with
a
world
so
that
i
should
still
be
able
to
chant
my
song
of
life
in
a
major
key
in
a
world
so
manifestly
minor
and
chromatic
these
things
fell
oddly
across
the
gravity
of
that
room
shadows
in
a
place
where
everything
was
clear
cobwebs
of
unreality
where
everything
was
real
they
made
me
sigh
and
they
made
me
smile
they
were
so
very
black
and
yet
so
very
little
i
used
to
wonder
what
that
usually
excellent
housemaid
experience
is
about
that
she
has
not
yet
been
after
you
with
her
broom
you
know
her
specialty
is
the
pulling
up
of
blinds
and
the
letting
in
of
the
morning
sun
but
it
is
unfair
to
judge
you
your
letters
since
you
knew
have
been
kindness
itself
thank
you
for
them
yours
sincerely
schmidt
it
seemed
so
strange
for
any
one
to
die
in
june
so
strange
to
be
lifeless
in
the
midst
of
the
wanton
profusion
of
life
to
grow
cold
in
that
quivering
radiance
of
heat
the
people
below
us
have
got
boxes
of
on
their
balcony
this
year
their
hot
heavy
scent
used
to
come
in
at
the
open
window
in
the
afternoons
when
the
sun
was
on
them
the
smell
of
life
intense
penetrating
filling
every
corner
of
the
room
with
splendid
pagan
summer
and
on
the
bed
tossed
my
muttering
ceaselessly
to
herself
of
christ
xxxv
jena
july
dear
anstruther
our
new
address
is
galgenberg
jena
rather
grim
but
what
in
a
name
the
thing
itself
is
perfect
it
is
a
tiny
house
white
with
green
shutters
on
the
south
slope
of
the
hill
among
the
garden
is
so
steep
that
you
ca
sit
down
in
it
except
on
the
north
side
of
the
house
where
you
can
because
the
house
is
there
to
stop
you
from
sliding
farther
it
is
a
strip
of
rough
grass
out
of
which
i
shall
make
haycocks
with
three
in
it
there
is
also
a
red
currant
bush
out
of
which
i
shall
make
jelly
at
the
bottom
below
the
fence
rotten
in
places
but
i
going
to
mend
that
begins
a
real
apple
orchard
and
through
its
leaves
we
can
look
down
on
the
roof
of
another
house
white
like
ours
but
a
little
bigger
and
with
blue
shutters
instead
of
green
people
take
it
for
the
summer
and
once
an
englishman
came
and
made
a
beanfield
there
but
i
think
i
told
you
about
the
beanfield
behind
us
right
away
up
the
slope
are
pine
trees
that
brush
restlessly
backward
and
forward
all
day
long
across
the
clouds
trying
to
sweep
bits
of
clear
blue
in
the
sky
and
at
night
spread
themselves
out
stiff
and
motionless
against
the
stars
i
saw
them
last
night
from
my
window
we
moved
in
yesterday
the
moving
in
was
not
very
easy
because
of
what
papa
calls
the
precipitous
nature
of
the
district
he
sat
with
his
back
propped
against
the
wall
of
the
house
on
the
only
side
on
which
as
i
have
explained
you
can
sit
and
worked
with
a
pencil
at
his
book
about
goethe
in
jena
with
perfect
placidity
while
johanna
and
i
and
the
man
who
urged
the
furniture
cart
up
the
hill
kept
on
stepping
over
his
legs
as
we
went
in
and
out
furnishing
the
house
there
was
not
much
to
furnish
which
was
lucky
there
not
being
much
to
furnish
with
we
have
got
rid
of
all
superfluities
including
the
canary
which
i
presented
its
cage
beautifully
tied
up
with
the
blue
ribbons
i
wore
at
my
first
party
to
the
little
girl
with
the
hair
on
the
second
floor
as
much
of
the
other
things
as
any
one
could
be
induced
to
buy
we
sold
and
we
burnt
what
nobody
would
buy
or
endure
having
given
them
and
so
pared
down
we
fit
in
here
quite
nicely
and
after
a
day
or
two
conceded
to
the
suavities
of
life
such
as
the
tacking
up
in
appropriate
places
of
muslin
curtains
and
the
tying
of
them
with
bows
i
intend
to
buy
a
spade
and
a
and
see
what
i
can
do
with
the
garden
i
wish
it
were
not
quite
so
steep
if
i
not
on
the
upper
side
of
one
of
the
with
my
back
firmly
pressed
against
its
trunk
i
yet
see
how
i
am
to
garden
it
must
be
disturbing
and
a
great
waste
of
time
to
have
to
hold
on
to
something
with
one
hand
while
you
garden
with
the
other
and
suppose
the
thing
gives
way
and
you
roll
down
on
to
the
broken
fence
and
if
that
too
gave
way
there
would
be
nothing
but
a
few
probably
inadequate
apple
trunks
between
me
and
the
roof
of
the
house
with
the
blue
shutters
i
should
think
it
extremely
likely
that
until
i
got
the
equivalent
for
what
are
known
as
i
shall
very
often
be
on
that
roof
i
hope
it
is
strong
and
new
perhaps
there
are
kind
people
inside
who
will
not
mind
soon
they
get
so
much
used
to
it
that
when
they
hear
the
preliminary
rush
among
their
and
the
cracking
of
the
branches
followed
by
the
thud
over
their
heads
they
wo
even
look
up
from
their
books
but
just
murmur
to
each
other
fräulein
schmidt
on
the
roof
again
and
go
on
with
their
studies
now
i
talking
nonsense
and
the
sort
of
nonsense
you
like
least
but
i
in
a
silly
mood
today
and
you
must
take
me
as
you
find
me
at
any
time
when
i
have
grown
too
unendurable
you
can
stop
my
writing
to
you
simply
by
not
writing
to
me
then
i
shall
know
you
have
at
last
had
enough
of
me
of
my
moods
of
my
odious
fits
of
bombastic
eloquence
of
my
still
more
odious
facetiousness
of
my
scoldings
of
you
and
of
my
complacency
about
myself
it
is
true
you
actually
seem
to
like
my
scoldings
that
is
very
abject
of
you
what
you
apparently
resent
are
the
letters
with
sturdy
sentiments
in
them
and
a
robust
relish
of
life
it
almost
seems
as
though
you
did
want
me
to
be
happy
that
is
very
odd
of
you
and
i
sometimes
wonder
if
it
is
possible
for
two
persons
to
continue
friends
who
have
a
different
taste
in
what
for
want
of
a
nicer
word
i
must
call
jokes
my
taste
in
them
is
so
elementary
that
an
bed
makes
me
laugh
tears
and
when
i
go
to
the
play
i
love
to
see
chairs
pulled
away
just
as
people
are
going
to
sit
down
you
of
course
shudder
at
these
things
they
fill
you
with
so
great
a
dreariness
that
it
amounts
to
pain
i
am
at
least
sensible
enough
to
understand
the
attitude
but
pleasantries
quite
high
up
as
i
consider
in
the
scale
of
humor
have
not
been
able
to
make
you
smile
i
have
seen
you
sit
unalterably
grave
while
papa
was
piping
out
the
nicest
little
things
and
i
know
you
never
liked
even
your
adored
professor
martens
when
he
began
to
bubble
well
either
i
laugh
too
easily
or
you
laugh
enough
i
can
only
repeat
that
if
i
set
your
teeth
on
edge
the
remedy
is
in
your
own
hands
we
are
going
to
be
vegetarians
this
summer
papa
who
has
tried
it
yet
is
perfectly
willing
and
if
we
live
chiefly
on
nuts
and
lettuces
we
shall
hardly
want
any
money
at
all
i
read
shelley
of
natural
aloud
to
him
before
we
left
the
flat
to
prepare
his
mind
and
he
not
only
heartily
agreed
with
every
word
but
went
at
once
to
the
free
library
and
dug
out
all
the
books
he
could
find
about
muscles
and
brains
and
their
surprising
dependence
on
the
kind
of
stuff
you
have
eaten
and
brought
them
home
for
me
to
study
i
do
love
papa
he
falls
in
so
sweetly
with
one
little
plans
and
lets
me
do
what
i
want
without
the
least
waste
of
time
in
questionings
or
the
giving
of
advice
i
have
read
the
books
with
profound
interest
only
a
person
who
cooks
who
has
to
handle
meat
when
it
is
raw
pick
out
the
internals
of
geese
peel
off
the
skins
of
rabbits
scrape
away
the
scales
of
a
fish
that
is
still
alive
my
insisted
on
this
the
flavor
she
said
being
so
infinitely
superior
that
way
can
know
with
what
a
relief
what
a
feeling
of
personal
purification
and
turning
of
the
back
on
evil
one
flings
a
cabbage
into
a
pot
of
fair
water
or
lets
one
fingers
linger
lovingly
among
lentils
i
brought
a
bag
of
lentils
up
the
hill
with
us
and
the
cabbage
remnant
of
my
last
marketing
came
up
too
in
a
net
and
we
had
our
dinner
today
of
them
lentil
soup
and
cabbage
with
what
could
be
purer
and
for
johanna
who
has
not
read
shelley
there
was
the
last
of
the
rauchgasse
sausage
for
the
soothing
of
her
more
immature
soul
that
was
an
hour
ago
and
papa
has
just
been
in
to
say
he
is
hungry
you
only
just
had
dinner
papachen
said
i
surprised
know
i
know
he
said
looking
vaguely
troubled
ca
really
be
hungry
perhaps
it
indigestion
agreed
papa
and
drifted
out
again
still
looking
troubled
before
we
took
this
house
it
had
stood
empty
for
several
years
and
the
man
it
belongs
to
was
so
glad
to
find
somebody
who
would
live
in
it
and
keep
it
warm
that
he
lets
us
have
it
for
hardly
any
rent
at
all
i
expect
what
the
impoverished
want
and
only
the
impoverished
would
live
in
a
thing
so
small
is
a
garden
flat
enough
to
grow
potatoes
in
and
to
have
fowls
walking
about
it
and
a
pig
in
a
nice
level
sty
you
have
them
here
at
least
you
could
have
a
sty
on
such
a
slope
the
poor
pig
would
spend
his
days
either
anxiously
hanging
on
with
all
his
claws
or
is
it
paws
i
forget
what
pigs
have
anyhow
with
all
his
might
to
the
hillside
or
huddled
dismally
down
against
the
end
planks
and
never
be
of
that
sublime
detachment
of
spirit
necessary
to
him
if
he
would
end
satisfactorily
in
really
fat
bacon
and
the
fowls
i
suppose
would
have
to
lay
their
eggs
flying
they
certainly
could
do
it
sitting
down
and
how
disturbing
that
would
be
to
a
person
engaged
as
i
often
am
in
staring
up
at
the
sky
for
how
can
you
stare
up
at
the
sky
under
an
umbrella
i
asked
the
landlord
about
the
potatoes
and
he
said
i
must
grow
them
as
the
last
tenant
did
a
widow
who
lived
and
died
here
in
a
strip
against
the
north
side
of
the
house
where
there
is
a
level
space
about
two
yards
running
from
one
end
of
the
house
to
the
other
representing
a
path
and
keeping
the
hill
from
tumbling
in
at
our
windows
it
really
is
the
only
place
for
i
do
see
how
johanna
and
i
gifted
and
resourceful
as
we
undoubtedly
are
can
make
terraces
with
no
tools
but
a
spade
and
a
but
it
will
do
away
with
our
only
path
and
it
does
seem
necessary
to
have
a
path
up
to
one
front
door
can
one
be
respectable
without
a
path
up
to
one
front
door
perhaps
one
can
and
that
too
may
be
a
superfluity
to
those
who
face
life
squarely
i
am
convinced
that
there
must
be
potatoes
but
i
am
not
convinced
on
reflection
that
there
need
be
a
path
have
you
ever
felt
the
joy
of
getting
rid
of
things
it
is
so
great
that
it
is
almost
ferocious
after
each
divestment
each
casting
off
and
away
there
is
such
a
gasp
of
relief
such
a
bounding
upward
the
satisfied
soul
proud
for
once
of
its
body
saying
to
it
smilingly
too
then
you
have
discovered
you
can
do
without
and
yet
be
happy
and
i
just
while
writing
these
words
to
you
have
discovered
that
i
can
and
will
do
without
paths
papa
has
been
in
again
it
not
he
asked
i
looked
at
him
amazed
is
never
at
two
i
said
reproachfully
two
is
it
only
said
papa
your
book
getting
on
well
i
inquired
yes
the
book
progresses
that
is
it
would
progress
if
my
attention
did
not
continually
wander
whereto
there
is
a
constant
gnawing
going
on
within
me
that
will
not
permit
me
to
believe
that
i
have
dined
but
papachen
you
have
i
saw
you
doing
it
you
saw
me
doing
was
not
dining
said
papa
dining
papa
waved
his
arms
round
oddly
and
suddenly
grass
he
cried
with
a
singular
impatience
i
echoed
still
more
amazed
of
an
enduring
nature
works
of
any
monumentalness
can
not
never
were
and
shall
not
be
raised
on
a
foundation
of
grass
said
papa
his
face
quite
red
ca
think
what
you
mean
said
i
is
there
any
grass
said
papa
quickly
clasping
his
hands
over
that
portion
of
him
that
we
boldly
talk
about
and
call
and
you
allude
to
sideways
by
a
variety
of
devious
expressions
have
been
fed
today
he
said
looking
at
me
quite
severely
a
diet
appropriate
only
to
the
mountain
goat
and
probably
only
appropriate
to
him
because
he
can
procure
nothing
better
you
had
a
lentil
soup
proved
scientifically
to
contain
all
that
is
needed
congratulate
the
lentil
soup
i
envy
it
i
wish
i
too
contained
all
that
is
needed
but
here
he
clasped
his
hands
again
is
nothing
there
is
there
is
cabbage
said
papa
stuff
herbage
scanty
herbage
too
appropriate
i
suppose
to
the
mountainous
region
in
which
we
now
find
ourselves
do
you
want
to
be
a
vegetarian
want
my
coffee
said
papa
now
why
not
now
is
there
anything
more
rational
than
to
eat
when
one
is
hungry
let
there
pray
be
much
very
much
butter
with
it
papa
we
were
going
to
have
coffee
any
more
did
you
agree
that
we
would
give
up
stimulants
papa
looked
at
me
defiantly
did
he
said
coffee
is
one
is
our
only
one
said
you
would
give
it
up
said
gradually
to
do
so
today
would
not
be
doing
so
gradually
nothing
is
good
that
is
not
done
gradually
one
must
begin
must
begin
gradually
were
delighted
with
shelley
was
after
dinner
were
quite
convinced
was
not
hungry
know
he
is
all
for
pure
water
is
all
for
many
things
that
seem
admirable
to
those
who
have
lately
dined
know
he
says
that
if
the
populace
of
paris
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
had
drunk
at
the
pure
source
of
the
seine
is
no
pure
source
of
the
seine
within
reach
of
the
populace
of
paris
there
would
only
be
cats
dead
cats
and
cats
interspersed
no
doubt
with
a
variety
of
objects
of
the
nature
of
portions
of
crockery
and
empty
tins
he
says
pure
source
he
says
pure
nonsense
says
if
they
had
done
that
and
satisfied
their
hunger
at
the
table
of
vegetable
nature
table
holy
heaven
the
good
the
excellent
young
man
they
would
never
have
lent
their
brutal
suffrage
to
the
proscription
list
of
robespierre
today
i
care
not
what
this
young
man
says
says
look
i
got
the
book
in
my
pocket
will
not
look
says
could
a
set
of
men
whose
passions
were
not
perverted
by
unnatural
stimuli
that
coffee
of
course
gaze
with
coolness
on
an
engage
to
gaze
with
heat
on
any
i
may
encounter
if
only
you
will
quickly
says
down
the
book
and
see
to
the
getting
of
coffee
he
says
him
say
it
and
see
to
the
coffee
says
is
it
to
be
believed
that
a
being
of
gentle
feelings
rising
from
his
meal
of
roots
meal
of
roots
would
take
delight
in
sports
of
blood
i
am
not
in
the
temper
for
shelley
you
quite
loved
him
a
day
or
two
ago
food
nobody
loves
anything
anything
at
all
while
his
stomach
is
empty
do
think
that
very
pretty
papachen
it
is
a
great
truth
remember
it
if
you
should
marry
shape
your
conduct
by
its
light
three
times
every
day
that
is
before
breakfast
before
dinner
and
before
supper
no
husband
loves
any
wife
she
may
be
as
beautiful
as
the
stars
as
wise
as
as
cultured
as
goethe
as
entertaining
as
a
circus
as
affectionate
as
you
please
he
cares
nothing
for
her
she
exists
not
go
my
child
and
prepare
the
coffee
and
let
the
be
cut
thick
well
since
then
i
have
been
cutting
and
pouring
out
cups
of
coffee
i
thought
papa
would
never
leave
off
if
that
is
the
effect
of
a
vegetarian
dinner
i
do
think
it
can
really
be
less
expensive
than
meat
papa
ate
half
a
pound
of
butter
which
is
sixty
pfennings
and
for
sixty
pfennings
i
could
have
bought
him
a
so
big
that
it
would
have
lasted
under
treatment
two
days
i
must
go
for
a
walk
and
think
it
out
yours
sincerely
schmidt

july
dear
anstruther
i
assure
you
that
we
have
all
we
want
so
do
not
please
go
on
feeling
distressed
about
us
why
should
you
feel
distressed
i
am
not
certain
that
i
do
not
resent
it
put
baldly
you
will
say
brutally
you
have
no
right
to
be
distressed
uneasy
anxious
and
all
the
other
things
you
say
you
are
about
the
private
concerns
of
persons
who
are
nothing
to
you
even
a
lamb
might
conceivably
feel
nettled
by
persistent
pity
when
it
knows
it
has
everything
in
the
world
it
wants
come
now
if
it
is
a
question
of
pity
we
will
have
it
in
the
right
place
and
i
will
pity
you
there
is
always
you
know
a
secret
satisfaction
in
the
soul
of
him
who
pities
he
does
hug
himself
and
whether
he
does
it
consciously
or
unconsciously
depends
on
his
aptitude
for
clear
compared
with
yours
i
deliberately
consider
my
life
glorious
and
when
will
you
see
that
there
are
kinds
of
gloriousness
that
can
not
be
measured
in
money
or
position
it
is
plain
to
me
and
it
would
be
so
to
you
if
you
thought
it
over
that
the
less
one
has
the
more
one
enjoys
we
want
space
time
concentration
for
getting
at
the
true
sweet
root
of
life
and
i
think
and
you
probably
do
not
that
the
true
sweet
root
of
life
is
in
any
one
thing
no
matter
what
thing
on
which
your
whole
undisturbed
attention
is
fixed
once
i
read
a
little
french
story
years
ago
with
my
mother
when
i
was
a
child
and
i
do
know
now
who
wrote
it
or
what
it
was
called
it
was
the
story
of
a
prisoner
who
found
a
plant
growing
between
the
flags
of
the
court
he
might
walk
in
and
i
think
it
was
a
wallflower
and
it
unfolding
itself
slowly
and
putting
out
one
tender
bit
of
green
after
the
other
in
that
gray
and
stony
place
stretched
out
little
hands
of
life
and
hope
and
interest
to
the
man
who
had
come
there
a
lost
soul
it
was
the
one
thing
he
had
it
ended
by
being
his
passion
with
nothing
else
to
distract
him
he
could
study
all
its
wonders
from
that
single
plant
he
learned
more
than
the
hurried
free
of
the
treasures
of
the
universe
learns
in
a
life
it
saved
him
from
despair
it
brought
him
back
to
the
eager
interest
in
the
marvellous
world
that
soul
feels
which
is
unencumbered
by
too
heavy
a
weight
of
trappings
why
i
still
have
too
much
and
here
are
you
pitying
me
because
i
have
not
more
when
i
am
distracted
by
all
the
claims
on
my
attention
i
can
look
at
whole
beds
of
wallflowers
every
spring
and
pass
on
with
nothing
but
a
vague
admiration
for
their
massed
beauty
of
scent
and
color
i
get
nothing
out
of
them
but
just
that
transient
glimpse
and
whiff
there
are
too
many
there
is
no
time
for
them
all
but
shut
me
up
for
weeks
alone
with
one
of
them
in
a
pot
and
i
too
would
get
out
of
it
the
measure
of
the
height
and
the
depth
and
the
wonder
of
life
and
then
you
exhort
me
not
to
live
on
vegetables
is
it
because
you
live
on
meat
i
do
think
i
mind
your
eating
meat
so
why
should
you
mind
my
eating
vegetables
i
have
done
it
for
a
week
now
quite
steadily
and
mean
to
give
it
at
least
a
fair
trial
if
what
the
books
we
have
got
about
it
say
is
true
health
and
sanity
lie
that
way
and
how
delightful
to
have
a
pure
kitchen
into
which
ghastly
dead
things
never
come
i
will
not
be
a
partaker
of
the
nature
of
beasts
i
will
not
become
three
parts
pig
or
goose
or
foolish
sheep
i
turn
with
aversion
from
the
reddened
horror
called
gravy
i
consider
it
a
monstrous
ugly
thing
to
have
particles
of
pig
rioting
up
and
down
my
veins
turning
into
brains
coloring
my
thoughts
becoming
a
very
part
of
my
body
surely
a
body
is
a
wonderful
thing
so
wonderful
that
it
can
not
be
treated
with
too
much
care
and
respect
so
wonderful
that
it
can
not
be
too
carefully
guarded
from
corruption
and
have
you
ever
studied
the
appearance
and
habits
of
pigs
but
i
do
admit
that
being
a
vegetarian
is
bewildering
none
of
the
books
say
a
word
about
the
odd
feeling
one
has
of
not
having
had
anything
to
eat
what
papa
felt
that
first
day
i
have
felt
every
day
since
i
am
perpetually
hungry
and
it
is
the
unpleasant
hunger
that
expresses
itself
in
a
dislike
for
food
in
listlessness
inability
to
work
flabbiness
even
faintness
at
eight
in
the
morning
i
begin
with
bread
and
plums
my
entire
being
cries
out
while
i
am
eating
them
for
coffee
with
milk
in
it
and
butter
on
my
bread
but
coffee
is
a
stimulant
and
the
books
say
that
butter
contains
no
nourishment
whatever
and
since
what
i
most
yearn
for
is
to
be
nourished
i
will
waste
no
time
eating
stuff
that
does
do
it
instead
i
eat
heaps
of
bread
and
stacks
of
plums
not
because
i
want
to
but
because
i
afraid
the
gnawing
feeling
will
follow
sooner
than
ever
if
i
do
papa
sits
opposite
me
breakfasting
pleasantly
on
eggs
for
he
explains
he
is
doing
things
gradually
and
is
using
the
eggs
to
build
wise
bridges
across
the
gulf
between
the
end
of
meat
and
the
beginning
of
what
he
persists
in
describing
as
herbage
at
nine
i
feel
as
if
i
had
had
no
breakfast
all
the
pains
i
took
to
get
through
the
bread
were
of
no
real
use
i
struggle
against
this
for
as
long
as
possible
because
the
books
say
you
must
have
things
between
meals
and
then
i
go
and
eat
more
plums
i
am
amazed
when
i
remember
that
once
i
liked
plums
no
words
can
express
my
abhorrence
of
them
now
but
what
is
to
be
done
they
are
the
only
fruit
we
can
get
cherries
are
over
apples
have
not
begun
we
buy
the
plums
from
the
neighbor
down
the
hill
to
add
to
my
horror
of
them
i
have
discovered
that
hardly
one
is
without
a
wriggly
live
thing
inside
it
i
wonder
how
many
of
them
i
have
eaten
can
they
be
brought
into
the
category
vegetarian
papa
says
yes
because
they
have
lived
and
moved
and
had
their
being
in
an
atmosphere
of
pure
plum
they
plum
says
papa
consoling
me
bits
of
plum
that
have
acquired
the
power
to
walk
about
but
according
to
that
beef
must
be
vegetarian
too
so
much
grass
grown
able
to
walk
about
it
is
very
bewildering
one
day
the
neighbor
he
is
a
nice
neighbor
interested
in
our
experiment
sent
us
some
raspberries
a
basket
of
them
all
glowing
and
downy
and
delicious
with
dew
and
covered
with
a
beautiful
silvery
cabbage
leaf
but
they
were
afflicted
in
just
the
same
way
only
more
so
papa
says
why
do
i
look
i
must
look
now
that
i
have
seen
the
things
once
and
so
the
end
of
the
raspberries
was
that
most
of
them
went
out
into
the
kitchen
and
johanna
who
has
no
prejudices
stewed
them
into
compote
and
ate
them
including
the
inhabitants
for
her
supper
for
dinner
by
which
time
i
am
curiously
shaky
quite
indifferent
to
food
and
possessed
of
an
immense
longing
to
lie
down
on
a
sofa
and
do
nothing
we
have
salad
and
potatoes
and
fruit
of
course
plums
and
lentils
because
they
are
so
good
for
us
it
is
a
pity
they
are
also
so
nasty
and
cheese
because
one
book
says
it
is
an
extraordinarily
convincing
book
that
if
a
man
shall
eat
beef
steadily
for
a
whole
morning
from
six
to
twelve
without
stopping
he
will
not
at
the
end
have
taken
in
half
the
nourishing
matter
that
he
would
have
absorbed
after
two
minutes
laid
out
judiciously
on
cheese
unfortunately
i
do
like
cheese
after
dinner
i
shut
myself
up
with
the
works
of
eustace
miles
which
tell
me
in
invigorating
language
of
all
the
money
time
and
energy
i
have
saved
of
my
increase
of
bodily
health
of
how
active
i
am
getting
how
skilful
and
of
what
a
tough
endurance
how
my
brains
have
grown
clear
and
nimble
my
morals
risen
high
above
the
average
and
how
keen
my
enjoyment
of
everything
has
become
including
strange
to
say
my
food
i
read
lying
down
too
spiritless
to
sit
up
and
johanna
in
the
kitchen
who
has
dined
on
pig
and
beer
washes
up
with
the
clatter
of
exuberant
energy
singing
while
she
does
so
in
a
voice
that
shakes
the
house
that
once
she
ein
it
is
very
bewildering
the
advice
one
gets
points
in
such
opposite
directions
for
instance
the
neighbor
made
friends
the
very
first
evening
with
papa
who
walked
with
injudicious
inattention
in
our
garden
and
slipped
down
through
a
gap
in
the
fence
into
his
orchard
and
his
arms
he
being
engaged
in
picking
up
the
fallen
plums
for
his
wife
to
make
jam
of
and
he
told
me
when
he
came
in
one
day
at
dinner
and
found
me
struggling
through
what
he
considered
dark
ways
and
i
thought
were
cabbages
that
my
salvation
lay
in
almonds
i
went
down
to
jena
that
afternoon
and
bought
three
pounds
of
them
they
were
dear
and
dreadfully
heavy
to
carry
up
the
hill
and
when
i
was
panting
past
the
neighbor
gate
his
wife
a
friendly
lady
who
reads
right
through
the
advertisements
in
the
paper
every
morning
and
spends
her
evenings
with
a
pencil
working
out
the
acrostics
was
standing
at
it
cool
and
comfortable
and
she
asked
me
with
the
simple
inquisitiveness
natural
to
our
nation
what
i
had
got
in
my
parcel
and
i
glad
to
stop
a
moment
and
get
my
breath
told
her
and
she
immediately
scoffed
both
at
her
husband
and
at
the
almonds
and
said
if
i
ate
them
i
would
lay
up
for
myself
an
old
age
steeped
in
a
dreadful
thing
called
xanthin
poison
i
went
home
and
consulted
the
books
the
neighbor
wife
was
right
johanna
made
macaroons
of
the
almonds
and
papa
who
loves
macaroons
chose
to
disbelieve
the
neighbor
wife
and
ate
them
but
the
books
are
not
always
so
unanimous
as
they
were
about
this
one
exhorted
us
to
eat
many
peas
and
beans
which
we
were
cheerfully
doing
for
are
they
not
in
summer
pleasant
things
when
i
read
in
another
that
we
might
as
well
eat
poison
so
full
were
they
too
of
qualities
ending
in
xanthin
poison
lentils
recommended
warmly
by
most
books
are
discountenanced
by
two
because
they
make
you
fat
rice
has
shared
the
same
condemnation
lettuces
we
may
eat
but
without
the
oil
that
soothes
and
the
vinegar
that
interests
and
if
you
add
salt
to
them
you
will
be
thirsty
and
you
must
never
drink
an
undressed
lettuce
a
quite
naked
lettuce
is
a
very
dull
thing
really
i
would
as
soon
eat
grass
we
do
refuse
at
present
to
follow
this
cruel
advice
and
have
salad
every
day
in
defiance
of
it
but
my
conscience
forces
me
to
put
less
and
less
dressing
in
it
each
time
hoping
that
so
shall
we
wean
ourselves
from
the
craving
for
it
as
papa
says
carrots
too
the
books
warn
us
against
i
forget
what
it
is
they
do
to
you
that
is
serious
but
the
neighbor
told
me
they
make
your
skin
shine
and
since
he
told
me
that
no
carrot
has
crossed
our
threshold
apples
we
may
eat
but
we
are
not
to
suppose
that
they
will
nourish
us
they
are
useful
only
for
preventing
by
their
bulk
the
walls
of
our
insides
from
coming
together
the
walls
of
the
vegetarian
inside
are
very
apt
to
come
together
if
the
owner
strikes
out
all
the
things
he
is
warned
against
from
his
menu
and
then
it
is
when
they
are
about
to
do
that
that
fibrous
bulk
most
convenient
in
this
form
should
be
applied
and
like
the
roasted
sunday
goose
of
our
fleshlier
days
in
rauchgasse
the
vegetarian
goes
about
stuffed
with
apples
meanwhile
there
are
no
apples
and
i
know
not
whither
i
must
turn
in
search
of
bulk
do
you
think
that
in
another
week
i
shall
be
strong
enough
to
write
to
you
yours
sincerely

july
dear
anstruther
this
is
a
most
sweet
evening
dripping
quiet
after
a
rainy
day
with
a
strip
of
clear
yellow
sky
behind
the
pine
trees
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
i
gathered
up
my
skirts
and
went
down
through
the
soaked
grass
to
where
against
the
fence
there
is
a
divine
straggly
bush
of
pink
china
roses
i
wanted
to
see
how
they
were
getting
on
after
their
drenching
and
as
i
stood
looking
at
them
in
the
calm
light
the
fence
at
the
back
of
them
sodden
into
dark
greens
and
blacks
that
showed
up
every
leaf
and
lovely
loose
wet
flower
a
robin
came
and
sat
on
the
fence
near
me
and
began
to
sing
you
will
say
well
what
next
and
there
is
any
next
at
least
not
a
next
that
i
am
likely
to
make
understandable
it
was
only
that
i
felt
extraordinarily
happy
you
will
say
but
why
and
if
i
were
to
explain
at
the
end
you
would
still
be
saying
why
well
you
can
not
see
my
face
while
i
am
writing
to
you
so
that
i
have
been
able
often
to
keep
what
i
was
really
thinking
safely
covered
up
but
you
must
suppose
that
my
letters
have
always
exactly
represented
my
state
of
mind
and
that
my
soul
has
made
no
pilgrimages
during
this
half
year
i
think
it
has
wandered
thousands
of
miles
and
often
while
i
wrote
scolding
you
or
was
being
wise
and
complacent
or
sprightly
and
offensive
often
just
then
the
tired
feet
of
it
were
bleeding
most
as
they
stumbled
among
the
bitter
stones
and
this
evening
i
felt
that
the
stones
were
at
an
end
that
my
soul
has
come
home
to
me
again
securely
into
my
keeping
glad
to
be
back
and
that
there
will
be
no
more
effort
needed
when
i
look
life
serenely
in
the
face
till
now
there
was
always
effort
that
i
talk
to
you
about
it
is
the
surest
sign
that
it
is
over
the
robin
singing
the
clear
light
behind
the
pines
the
dripping
trees
and
bushes
the
fragrance
of
the
wet
roses
the
little
white
house
so
modest
and
hidden
where
papa
and
i
are
going
to
be
happy
the
perfect
quiet
after
a
stormy
day
the
perfect
peace
after
discordant
months
oh
i
wanted
to
say
thank
you
for
each
of
these
beautiful
things
do
you
remember
you
gave
me
a
book
of
ernest
poems
on
the
birthday
i
had
while
you
were
with
us
and
do
you
remember
his
now
i
will
take
me
to
a
place
of
peace
forget
my
heart
desire
in
solitude
and
prayer
work
out
my
soul
release
it
is
what
i
feel
i
have
done
but
i
will
not
bore
you
with
these
sentiments
see
i
am
always
anxious
to
get
back
quickly
to
the
surface
of
things
anxious
to
skim
lightly
over
the
places
where
tears
happy
or
miserable
lie
and
not
to
touch
with
so
much
as
the
brush
of
a
wing
the
secret
tendernesses
of
the
soul
let
us
sir
get
back
to
vegetables
they
are
so
safe
as
subjects
for
polite
and
i
have
had
three
letters
from
you
this
week
condemning
their
use
with
all
the
fervor
the
english
language
places
at
your
disposal
really
it
is
generous
to
you
in
this
respect
as
a
substitute
for
the
mixed
diet
of
the
ordinary
philistine
yes
sir
i
regard
you
as
an
ordinary
philistine
and
if
you
want
to
know
what
that
in
my
opinion
is
it
is
one
who
walks
along
in
the
ruts
he
found
ready
instead
of
after
sitting
on
a
milestone
and
taking
due
thought
making
his
own
ruts
for
himself
you
are
one
of
a
flock
and
you
disapprove
of
sheep
like
myself
that
choose
to
wander
off
and
browse
alone
you
condemn
all
my
practices
nothing
that
i
think
or
do
seems
good
in
your
eyes
you
tell
me
roundly
that
i
am
selfish
and
accuse
me
not
roundly
because
you
are
afraid
it
might
be
indecorous
but
obliquely
in
a
mask
of
words
that
does
not
for
an
instant
hide
your
meaning
of
wearing
jaeger
garments
beneath
my
outer
apparel
soon
i
gather
you
expect
i
shall
become
a
spiritualist
and
a
social
democrat
and
quite
soon
after
that
i
suppose
you
are
sure
i
shall
cut
off
my
hair
and
go
about
in
sandals
well
i
tell
you
something
that
may
keep
you
quiet
tired
of
vegetarianism
it
is
that
i
crave
for
fleshpots
for
i
shall
continue
as
before
to
turn
my
back
on
them
on
boiled
and
roast
the
heated
nose
in
face
of
ghost
but
i
grudge
the
time
it
takes
and
the
thought
it
takes
for
the
fortnight
i
have
followed
its
precepts
i
have
lived
more
entirely
for
my
body
than
in
any
one
fortnight
of
my
life
it
was
all
body
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
i
was
tending
it
the
whole
day
instead
of
growing
as
i
had
fondly
hoped
so
free
in
spirit
that
i
would
be
able
to
draw
quite
close
to
the
i
was
sunk
in
a
pit
of
indifference
to
everything
needing
effort
or
enthusiasm
and
it
is
not
simple
after
all
shelley
meal
of
roots
sounds
easy
and
elementary
but
think
of
the
exertion
of
going
out
strengthened
only
by
other
roots
to
find
more
for
your
next
meal
nuts
and
fruits
things
that
require
no
cooking
really
were
elaborate
nuisances
the
nuts
having
to
be
cracked
and
the
fruit
freed
from
what
papa
called
its
pedestrian
portions
and
they
were
so
useless
even
then
to
a
person
who
wanted
to
go
out
and
dig
in
the
garden
all
they
could
do
for
me
was
to
make
me
appreciate
sofas
i
am
tired
of
it
tired
of
wasting
precious
time
thinking
about
and
planning
my
wretched
diet
yesterday
i
had
an
egg
for
breakfast
it
gave
me
one
of
moments
and
a
heavenly
bowl
of
coffee
with
milk
in
it
and
the
effect
was
to
send
me
out
singing
into
the
garden
and
to
start
me
mending
the
fence
the
neighbor
came
up
to
see
what
the
vigorous
and
snatches
of
could
mean
and
when
he
saw
it
was
i
immediately
called
out
have
been
eating
meat
have
not
i
said
swinging
my
hammer
to
show
what
eggs
and
milk
can
do
some
form
or
other
you
have
this
day
joined
yourself
to
the
animal
kingdom
he
persisted
and
when
i
told
him
about
my
breakfast
he
wiped
his
hands
he
had
been
picking
fruit
and
shook
mine
and
congratulated
me
have
watched
with
concern
he
said
eyes
becoming
daily
bigger
it
is
not
good
when
eyes
do
that
now
they
will
shrink
to
their
normal
size
and
you
will
at
last
set
your
disgraceful
garden
in
order
are
you
aware
that
the
grass
ought
to
have
been
made
into
hay
a
month
ago
he
is
a
haggard
man
thin
of
cheek
round
of
shoulder
short
of
sight
who
teaches
little
boys
latin
and
greek
in
weimar
for
thirty
years
has
he
taught
them
eking
out
his
income
in
the
way
we
all
do
in
these
parts
by
taking
in
foreigners
wanting
to
learn
german
in
july
he
shakes
eis
foreigners
off
and
comes
up
here
for
six
weeks
vacant
pottering
in
his
orchard
he
bought
the
house
as
a
speculation
and
lets
the
upper
part
to
any
one
who
will
take
it
living
himself
with
his
wife
and
son
on
the
ground
floor
he
is
extremely
kind
to
me
and
has
given
me
to
understand
that
he
considers
me
intelligent
so
of
course
i
like
him
only
those
persons
who
love
intelligence
in
others
and
have
doubts
about
their
own
know
the
deliciousness
of
being
told
a
thing
like
that
i
adore
being
praised
i
am
athirst
for
it
dreadfully
vain
down
in
my
heart
i
go
about
pretending
a
fine
aloofness
from
such
weakness
so
that
when
nobody
sees
anything
in
me
and
nobody
ever
does
i
may
at
least
make
a
show
of
not
having
expected
them
to
thus
does
a
girl
in
a
with
whom
no
one
will
dance
pretend
she
does
not
want
to
thus
did
the
familiar
fox
conduct
himself
toward
the
grapes
of
tradition
very
well
do
i
know
there
is
nothing
to
praise
but
because
i
am
just
clever
enough
to
know
that
i
am
not
clever
to
be
told
that
i
am
clever
do
you
follow
me
sets
me
tingling
now
that
enough
about
me
let
us
talk
about
you
you
must
not
come
to
jena
what
could
have
put
such
an
idea
into
your
head
it
is
a
blazing
deserted
place
just
now
looking
from
the
top
of
the
hills
like
a
basin
of
hot
down
there
in
the
hollow
wrapped
in
its
steam
the
university
is
shut
up
the
professors
scattered
martens
is
in
switzerland
and
wo
be
back
till
september
even
the
schmidts
those
interesting
people
have
flapped
up
with
screams
of
satisfaction
into
a
nest
on
the
side
of
a
precipice
i
urge
you
with
all
my
authority
to
stay
where
you
are
plainly
if
you
were
to
come
i
would
not
see
you
oh
i
will
leave
off
pretending
i
can
not
imagine
what
you
want
here
i
know
you
want
to
see
me
well
you
shall
not
why
you
should
want
to
is
altogether
beyond
my
comprehension
i
believe
you
have
come
to
regard
me
as
a
sort
of
medicine
medicine
of
the
tonic
order
and
wish
to
bring
your
sick
soul
to
the
very
place
where
it
is
dispensed
but
i
you
see
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
sick
souls
and
i
wholly
repudiate
the
idea
of
being
somebody
physic
i
will
not
be
your
physic
what
medicinal
properties
you
can
extract
from
my
letters
you
are
welcome
to
but
pray
are
you
mad
that
you
should
think
of
coming
here
when
you
do
come
you
are
to
come
with
your
wife
and
when
you
have
a
wife
you
are
not
to
come
at
all
how
simple
really
i
feel
inclined
to
laugh
when
i
try
to
picture
you
after
the
life
you
have
been
leading
in
london
after
the
days
you
are
living
now
at
clinches
attempting
to
arrange
yourself
on
this
perch
of
ours
up
here
i
can
not
picture
you
we
have
reduced
our
existence
to
the
crudest
elements
to
the
raw
material
and
you
i
know
have
grown
a
very
exquisite
young
man
the
fact
is
you
have
had
time
to
forget
what
we
are
really
like
my
father
and
i
and
johanna
and
since
my
time
we
have
advanced
far
in
the
casual
scrappiness
of
housekeeping
that
we
love
you
would
be
like
some
strange
and
splendid
bird
in
the
midst
of
three
extremely
shabby
sparrows
that
is
the
physical
point
of
view
a
thing
to
be
laughed
at
from
the
moral
it
is
for
ever
impossible
yours
sincerely
schmidt
xxxviii
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
it
is
pleasant
of
you
to
take
the
trouble
to
emulate
our
neighbor
and
tell
me
that
you
too
think
me
intelligent
you
put
it
it
is
true
more
elaborately
than
he
does
with
a
greater
embroidery
of
fine
words
but
i
will
try
to
believe
you
equally
sincere
i
make
you
a
profound
it
a
more
expressive
word
than
curtsey
of
polite
gratitude
but
it
is
less
excellent
of
you
to
add
on
the
top
of
these
praises
that
i
am
adorable
with
words
like
that
inappropriate
and
to
me
eternally
unconvincing
this
correspondence
will
come
to
an
abrupt
end
i
shall
not
write
again
if
that
is
how
you
are
going
to
play
the
game
i
would
not
write
now
if
i
were
less
indifferent
as
it
is
i
can
look
on
with
perfect
calm
most
serenely
unmoved
by
anything
in
that
direction
you
may
say
to
me
but
if
you
care
to
have
letters
do
not
say
them
again
i
shall
never
choose
to
allow
you
to
suppose
me
vile
yours
sincerely
schmidt
xxxix
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
you
need
not
have
sent
me
so
many
pages
of
protestations
nothing
you
can
say
will
persuade
me
that
i
am
adorable
and
i
did
exactly
mean
the
world
vile
do
not
quarrel
with
miss
cheriton
but
if
you
must
do
not
tell
me
about
it
why
should
you
always
want
to
tell
one
of
us
about
the
other
have
you
no
sense
of
what
is
fit
i
am
nothing
to
you
and
i
will
not
hear
these
things
yours
sincerely
schmidt
xl
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
you
must
really
write
a
book
write
a
very
long
one
with
plenty
of
room
for
all
your
words
what
is
your
bill
for
postage
now
johanna
i
am
sure
thinks
you
are
sending
me
instalments
of
manuscript
and
marvels
at
the
extravagance
that
shuts
it
up
in
envelopes
instead
of
leaving
its
ends
open
and
tying
it
up
with
string
once
more
i
must
beg
you
not
to
write
about
miss
cheriton
it
is
useless
to
remind
me
that
i
have
posed
as
your
sister
and
that
to
your
sister
you
may
confide
anything
because
i
am
not
your
sister
sometimes
i
have
written
of
an
attitude
toward
you
but
that
of
course
was
only
talk
i
am
not
irascible
enough
for
the
position
i
do
think
though
you
ought
to
be
surrounded
by
women
who
are
cross
six
cross
and
determined
elder
sisters
would
do
wonders
for
you
and
so
would
a
mother
with
an
iron
will
and
perhaps
an
aunt
living
in
the
house
might
be
a
good
thing
one
of
those
aunts
i
believe
sufficiently
abundant
who
pierce
your
soul
with
their
eyes
and
then
describe
it
minutely
at
in
the
presence
of
the
family
expatiating
particularly
on
what
those
corners
of
it
look
like
those
corners
you
thought
so
secret
in
which
are
huddled
your
dearest
faults
yours
sincerely
schmidt
xli
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
very
well
i
wo
quarrel
i
will
be
friends
friends
that
is
so
long
as
you
allow
me
to
be
so
in
the
only
right
and
possible
way
do
murder
too
many
grouse
think
of
my
disapproving
scowl
when
you
are
beginning
to
do
it
and
then
perhaps
your
day
of
slaughter
will
resolve
itself
into
an
innocent
picnic
on
the
moors
alone
with
sky
and
heather
and
a
bored
astonished
dog
are
you
not
glad
now
that
you
went
to
scotland
instead
of
coming
to
jena
to
find
the
schmidts
not
at
home
surely
long
days
in
the
heather
by
yourself
will
do
much
toward
making
you
friends
with
life
i
think
those
moors
must
be
so
beautiful
really
very
nearly
as
good
as
my
galgenberg
my
galgenberg
by
the
bye
has
left
off
being
quite
so
admirably
solitary
as
it
was
at
first
the
neighbor
is
as
i
told
you
extremely
friendly
so
is
his
wife
though
i
do
not
set
such
store
by
her
friendliness
as
i
do
by
his
for
frankly
i
find
men
are
best
and
they
have
a
son
who
is
an
in
berlin
you
know
what
an
is
do
you
it
is
a
person
who
will
presently
be
a
and
you
know
what
a
is
it
what
you
are
before
you
turn
into
a
and
a
is
what
you
are
before
you
are
a
and
a
if
he
lives
long
enough
and
irritate
anybody
in
authority
becomes
ultimately
that
impressive
and
glorious
being
a
implying
that
before
he
was
only
in
fun
dem
prädikat
and
do
say
i
do
explain
nicely
because
i
do
well
where
was
i
oh
yes
at
the
son
well
he
appeared
a
fortnight
ago
brown
and
hot
and
with
a
knapsack
having
walked
all
the
way
from
berlin
and
is
spending
his
holiday
with
his
people
for
a
day
or
two
i
thought
him
quite
ordinary
he
made
rather
silly
jokes
and
wore
a
red
tie
then
one
evening
i
heard
lovely
sounds
lovely
floating
mellow
sounds
coming
up
in
floods
through
the
orchard
into
my
garden
where
i
was
propped
against
a
watching
a
huge
yellow
moon
disentangling
itself
slowly
from
the
mists
of
jena
oh
but
exquisite
sounds
sounds
that
throbbed
into
your
soul
and
told
it
all
it
wanted
to
hear
showed
it
the
way
to
all
it
was
looking
for
talked
to
it
wonderfully
of
the
possibilities
of
life
first
they
drew
me
on
to
my
feet
then
they
drew
me
down
the
garden
then
through
the
orchard
nearer
and
nearer
till
at
last
i
stood
beneath
the
open
window
they
were
coming
from
listening
with
all
my
ears
against
the
wall
i
leaned
holding
my
breath
forced
to
ponder
great
themes
themes
of
life
and
death
the
music
falling
like
drops
of
liquid
light
in
dark
and
thirsty
places
i
do
know
how
long
it
lasted
or
how
long
i
stood
there
after
it
was
finished
but
some
one
came
to
the
window
and
put
his
head
out
into
the
freshness
and
what
do
you
think
he
said
he
said
wie
man
im
zimmer
and
it
was
the
son
brown
and
hot
and
with
a
red
tie
fräulein
schmidt
said
he
suddenly
perceiving
me
evening
a
fine
evening
i
did
not
know
i
had
an
audience
said
i
unable
at
once
to
adjust
myself
to
politenesses
you
like
music
said
i
still
vibrating
is
a
good
violin
i
picked
it
up
and
he
told
me
a
great
many
things
that
i
did
not
hear
for
how
can
you
hear
when
your
spirit
refuses
to
come
back
from
its
journeyings
among
the
stars
you
not
enter
he
said
at
last
mother
is
fetching
up
some
beer
and
will
be
here
in
a
moment
it
makes
one
warm
playing
but
i
would
not
enter
i
walked
back
slowly
through
the
long
orchard
grass
between
the
trees
the
moon
gleamed
along
the
branches
the
branches
were
weighed
down
with
apples
the
place
was
full
of
the
smell
of
fruit
of
the
smell
of
fruit
fallen
into
the
grass
that
had
lain
there
bruised
all
day
in
the
sun
i
think
the
beauty
of
the
world
is
crushing
often
it
seems
almost
unbearable
calling
out
such
an
acuteness
of
sensation
such
a
vivid
leaping
sensitiveness
of
feeling
that
indeed
it
is
like
pain
but
what
i
want
to
talk
about
is
the
strange
way
good
things
come
out
of
evil
it
really
almost
makes
you
respect
and
esteem
the
bad
things
doing
it
with
an
intelligent
eye
fixed
on
the
future
here
is
our
young
friend
down
the
hill
a
young
man
most
ordinary
in
every
way
but
one
so
ordinary
that
i
think
we
must
put
him
under
the
heading
bad
taking
bad
in
the
sense
of
negation
of
want
of
good
here
he
is
robust
of
speech
fond
of
beer
red
of
tie
chosen
as
her
temple
by
that
delicate
lady
the
muse
of
melody
apparently
she
is
not
very
particular
about
her
temples
it
is
true
while
he
is
playing
at
her
dictation
she
transforms
him
wholly
and
i
suppose
she
does
not
care
what
he
is
like
in
between
but
i
do
i
care
because
in
between
he
thinks
it
pleasant
to
entertain
me
with
facetiousness
his
mother
hanging
fondly
on
every
word
in
the
amazing
way
mothers
often
otherwise
quite
intelligent
persons
do
since
that
first
evening
he
has
played
every
evening
and
his
taste
in
music
is
as
perfect
as
it
is
bad
in
everything
else
it
is
severe
exquisite
exclusive
it
is
the
taste
that
plays
mozart
and
bach
and
beethoven
and
wastes
no
moments
with
the
mendelssohn
sugar
or
the
lesser
inspiration
of
brahms
i
tried
to
strike
illumination
out
of
him
on
these
points
wanted
to
hear
his
reasons
for
a
greater
exclusiveness
than
i
have
yet
met
went
through
a
string
of
impressive
names
beginning
with
schumann
and
ending
with
wagner
and
tchaikowsky
but
he
showed
no
interest
and
no
intelligence
either
unless
a
shrug
of
the
shoulder
is
intelligent
it
is
true
he
remarked
one
day
that
he
found
life
too
short
for
anything
but
the
best
is
why
he
added
unable
to
forbear
from
wit
only
drink
pilsner
i
cried
ignoring
the
pilsner
do
not
these
great
men
again
i
ran
through
a
string
of
them
not
they
also
belong
to
the
very
best
he
said
and
would
say
no
more
so
you
see
he
is
obstinate
as
well
as
of
course
such
exclusiveness
in
art
is
it
besides
it
is
very
possible
he
is
wrong
you
i
know
used
to
perch
brahms
on
one
of
the
highest
peaks
of
parnassus
i
never
thought
there
was
quite
room
enough
for
him
on
it
and
did
you
not
go
three
times
all
the
way
to
munich
while
you
were
with
us
to
hear
mottl
conduct
the
surely
it
is
probable
a
person
of
your
good
taste
is
a
better
judge
than
a
person
of
his
very
nearly
bad
taste
whatever
your
faults
may
be
you
never
made
a
fault
in
ties
never
clamored
almost
ceaselessly
for
drink
never
talked
about
nor
entertained
young
women
from
next
door
with
the
tricks
and
facetiousness
of
a
mountebank
i
wonder
if
his
system
were
carried
into
literature
and
life
were
wholly
concentrated
on
the
half
dozen
absolutely
best
writers
so
that
we
who
spread
our
attention
out
thin
over
areas
i
am
certain
are
much
too
wide
knew
them
as
we
never
can
know
them
became
part
of
them
lived
with
them
and
in
them
saw
through
their
eyes
and
thought
with
their
thoughts
whether
there
would
be
gain
or
loss
i
do
know
tell
me
what
you
think
if
i
might
only
have
the
six
mightiest
books
to
go
with
me
through
life
i
would
certainly
have
to
learn
greek
because
of
homer
but
when
it
comes
to
the
very
mightiest
i
can
not
even
get
my
six
i
can
only
get
four
of
course
when
i
loosely
say
six
books
i
mean
the
works
of
six
writers
but
beyond
my
four
i
can
not
get
there
must
be
a
slight
drop
for
the
other
two
very
slight
hardly
a
drop
rather
a
slight
downward
quiver
into
a
radiance
the
faintest
degree
less
blazing
but
still
a
degree
less
these
two
would
be
milton
and
virgil
the
other
four
but
you
know
the
other
four
without
my
telling
you
i
am
not
sure
that
the
is
not
right
and
that
one
can
not
in
matters
of
the
spirit
be
too
exclusive
exclusiveness
means
concentration
deeper
study
minuter
knowledge
for
we
only
have
a
handful
of
years
to
do
anything
in
and
they
are
quite
surely
not
enough
to
go
round
when
going
round
means
taking
in
the
whole
world
on
the
other
hand
would
my
speech
become
archaic
i
afraid
i
would
have
a
tendency
that
would
grow
to
address
papa
in
blank
verse
my
language
even
when
praying
him
at
breakfast
to
give
me
butter
would
be
incorrigibly
noble
i
do
think
papa
would
like
it
and
what
would
he
say
to
a
daughter
who
was
forced
by
stress
of
concentration
on
six
works
to
go
through
life
without
goethe
goethe
you
observe
was
not
one
of
the
two
less
glorious
and
he
certainly
was
not
one
of
the
four
completely
glorious
i
begin
to
fear
i
should
miss
a
great
deal
by
my
exclusions
it
would
be
sad
to
die
without
ever
having
been
thrilled
by
exalted
by
amazed
by
the
sent
to
sleep
by
to
die
innocent
of
any
knowledge
of
schiller
with
no
memory
of
strenuous
hours
spent
getting
it
by
heart
at
school
might
be
quite
pleasant
but
i
think
it
would
end
by
being
tiring
to
be
screwed
up
perpetually
to
the
pitch
of
the
greatest
men
greatest
moments
such
heights
are
not
for
insects
like
myself
i
would
hang
very
dismally
with
drooping
head
and
wings
on
those
exalted
hooks
and
has
not
the
soul
too
its
longings
at
times
for
a
and
slippers
and
do
you
see
how
you
could
do
without
boswell
yours
sincerely
schmidt
xlii
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
yes
of
course
he
does
he
plays
every
evening
and
every
evening
i
go
and
listen
either
in
the
orchard
beneath
the
open
window
or
more
ceremoniously
inside
the
room
with
or
without
papa
i
find
it
a
pleasant
thing
i
am
living
in
a
bath
of
music
and
i
hope
you
do
expect
me
to
agree
with
your
criticism
of
music
as
a
of
on
the
whole
emotions
what
are
emotions
are
they
the
ones
that
you
have
and
was
it
to
have
them
stirred
that
you
used
to
journey
so
often
to
munich
and
mottl
stirred
up
i
certainly
am
not
in
the
way
i
admit
in
which
a
poem
of
does
it
not
affected
in
the
least
as
i
am
affected
by
for
instance
the
majesty
of
the
poem
on
but
if
less
nobly
still
very
effectually
there
i
have
apparently
begun
to
agree
with
you
well
i
do
see
the
moment
i
begin
to
consider
that
what
is
stirred
is
less
noble
i
do
see
that
what
i
feel
when
i
listen
to
music
is
chiefly
and
i
do
think
much
of
you
have
no
word
for
it
perhaps
in
england
you
do
not
have
just
that
form
of
sentiment
it
is
a
forlorn
thing
made
up
mostly
of
vague
ingredients
vague
yearnings
vague
regrets
vague
dissatisfactions
when
it
comes
over
you
you
remember
all
the
people
who
are
absent
and
you
are
sad
and
the
people
who
are
dead
and
you
sigh
and
the
times
you
have
been
naughty
and
you
groan
i
do
see
that
a
sentiment
that
makes
you
do
that
is
not
the
highest
it
is
profitless
sterile
it
does
send
you
on
joyfully
to
the
next
thing
but
keeps
you
lingering
in
the
dust
of
churchyards
barren
places
of
the
past
which
should
never
be
revisited
by
the
now
this
looks
as
though
i
were
agreeing
with
you
quite
but
i
still
do
you
put
it
so
extremely
it
is
so
horrid
to
think
that
even
my
emotions
may
be
i
long
ago
became
aware
that
my
manners
were
so
but
i
did
like
to
believe
there
was
nothing
about
my
soul
well
what
is
one
to
do
never
be
soft
never
be
sad
or
sorry
or
repentant
always
stay
up
at
the
level
of
poem
or
of
his
a
solemn
strung
high
up
to
an
unchanging
pitch
of
frigid
splendor
and
nobleness
it
is
what
i
try
to
aim
at
it
is
what
i
would
best
like
then
comes
our
friend
of
the
red
tie
and
in
the
cool
of
the
day
when
the
world
is
dim
and
scented
shakes
a
little
fugue
of
bach
out
of
his
fiddle
a
sparkling
sly
little
fugue
frolicsome
for
all
its
minor
key
a
handful
of
bright
threads
woven
together
twisted
in
and
out
playing
it
would
seem
at
some
game
of
of
pretending
to
want
to
catch
each
other
into
a
tangle
but
always
gayly
coming
out
of
the
knots
each
distinct
and
holding
on
its
shining
way
till
the
meeting
at
the
end
the
final
embrace
when
the
game
is
over
and
they
tie
themselves
contentedly
together
into
one
comfortable
major
chord
our
friend
plays
this
this
manifestly
happy
thing
and
my
soul
listens
and
smiles
and
sighs
and
longs
and
ends
by
being
steeped
in
i
choose
the
little
fugue
of
bach
as
an
instance
for
of
all
music
it
is
aimed
most
distinctly
at
the
intellect
it
is
the
furthest
removed
from
and
if
it
has
this
effect
on
me
i
will
not
make
you
uncomfortable
by
a
description
of
what
the
baser
musics
do
the
musics
of
passion
of
furious
exultations
and
furious
despairs
but
my
vague
wish
for
i
do
not
know
what
gentle
and
rather
sweetly
resigned
when
the
accompaniment
is
bach
swells
suddenly
while
i
listen
to
them
into
a
terrifying
longing
that
rends
and
shatters
my
soul
what
private
things
i
tell
you
i
would
if
i
were
talking
i
would
be
affected
by
your
actual
presence
but
writing
is
so
different
and
so
strange
at
once
so
much
more
and
so
much
less
intimate
the
body
is
safe
far
away
unassailable
and
the
spirit
lets
itself
go
out
to
meet
a
fellow
spirit
with
the
frankness
it
can
never
show
when
the
body
goes
too
that
grievous
hinderer
of
the
communion
of
saints
that
officious
blunderer
who
can
spoil
the
serenest
intercourse
by
a
single
blush
johanna
came
in
just
there
she
was
decked
in
smiles
and
wanted
to
say
till
morning
it
is
her
night
out
and
she
really
looked
rather
wonderful
to
one
used
to
her
kitchen
condition
her
skin
cleansed
from
soilure
was
surprisingly
fair
her
hair
waved
more
beautifully
than
mine
will
ever
be
was
piled
up
in
bright
imposing
masses
her
starched
white
dress
had
pink
ribbons
about
it
she
wore
cotton
gloves
and
held
the
handkerchief
i
lend
her
on
these
occasions
genteelly
by
its
middle
in
her
hand
every
second
sunday
she
descends
the
mountain
at
sunset
the
in
her
pocket
and
dances
all
night
in
some
convivial
in
the
town
coming
up
again
at
sunrise
or
later
according
to
the
amount
of
fun
she
was
having
on
the
monday
i
do
nearly
everything
alone
for
she
sleeps
half
the
day
and
the
other
half
she
does
like
being
talked
to
she
is
a
good
servant
and
she
would
certainly
go
if
we
tried
to
get
her
in
again
under
the
twelve
hours
on
the
alternate
sundays
we
allow
her
to
have
her
young
man
up
for
the
afternoon
and
evening
he
is
a
trumpeter
in
the
regiment
stationed
in
jena
and
he
brings
his
trumpet
to
fill
up
awkward
silences
engaged
couples
of
that
kind
do
seem
able
to
talk
much
so
that
the
trumpet
is
a
great
comfort
to
them
whenever
conversation
flags
he
whips
it
out
and
blows
a
rousing
blast
giving
her
time
to
think
of
something
to
say
next
i
had
to
ask
him
to
do
it
in
the
garden
for
the
first
time
it
nearly
blew
our
roof
which
is
very
tightly
on
off
now
he
and
she
sit
together
on
a
bench
outside
the
door
and
the
genius
down
the
hill
with
the
exclusive
ears
suffers
i
am
afraid
rather
acutely
papa
and
i
wander
as
far
away
as
we
can
get
among
the
mountains
it
is
rather
dreadful
when
they
quarrel
then
of
course
johanna
sulks
as
girls
will
and
sulks
are
silent
things
so
that
the
trumpet
has
to
fill
up
a
yawning
gulf
and
never
leaves
off
at
all
last
sunday
it
blew
the
whole
time
we
were
out
and
i
expected
when
i
got
home
to
find
the
engagement
broken
off
we
stayed
away
as
long
as
we
could
climbing
higher
and
higher
wandering
further
and
further
supping
at
last
reluctantly
on
cucumber
salad
and
cold
herrings
in
the
little
restaurant
up
on
the
schweizerhohe
because
the
trumpet
would
stop
and
we
dare
go
home
till
it
did
its
blasts
pursued
us
even
into
the
recesses
of
the
dingy
wooden
hall
we
took
our
ears
into
vainly
trying
to
carry
them
somewhere
out
of
range
it
seemed
to
be
a
serious
quarrel
we
had
a
depressing
meal
we
both
esteem
johanna
with
the
craven
esteem
you
feel
for
a
person
at
any
moment
capable
of
giving
notice
who
does
all
the
unpleasant
things
you
would
otherwise
have
to
do
yourself
the
state
of
her
temper
seriously
affects
our
peace
you
see
the
house
is
small
and
if
her
trumpeter
has
been
unsatisfactory
and
she
throws
the
saucepans
about
or
knocks
the
broom
in
sweeping
against
all
the
wooden
things
like
doors
and
it
makes
an
unendurable
clatter
and
puts
an
end
at
once
to
papa
work
and
to
my
equally
earnest
play
if
her
nerves
being
already
on
edge
i
were
to
suggest
to
her
even
smilingly
to
be
quiet
she
would
at
once
give
notice
i
know
she
would
and
the
dreary
search
begin
again
for
that
impossible
treasure
you
in
england
call
a
paragon
and
we
in
jena
call
a
pearl
where
am
i
to
find
a
clean
honest
strong
pearl
able
to
cook
and
willing
to
come
and
live
in
what
is
something
like
an
unopened
so
so
so
solitary
would
her
existence
here
be
for
eight
pounds
a
year
it
is
easy
for
you
august
persons
who
never
see
your
servants
who
have
so
many
that
by
sheer
force
of
numbers
they
become
unnoticeable
to
deride
us
who
have
only
one
for
being
so
greatly
at
her
mercy
i
know
you
will
deride
i
see
your
letter
already
fräulein
schmidt
is
not
your
attitude
toward
the
maid
johanna
unworthy
it
is
unworthy
because
it
is
natural
defiantly
i
confess
that
it
is
also
cringing
well
it
is
natural
to
cringe
under
the
circumstances
so
would
you
i
dare
say
if
your
personal
servant
is
a
good
one
and
you
depend
much
on
him
for
comfort
you
do
do
it
as
it
is
and
there
are
very
few
girls
in
jena
who
would
come
out
of
it
and
take
a
situation
on
the
side
of
a
precipice
for
eight
pounds
a
year
really
the
wages
are
small
balanced
against
the
disadvantages
and
wages
are
going
up
down
in
jena
a
good
servant
can
get
ten
pounds
a
year
now
without
much
difficulty
so
that
it
behooves
us
who
can
not
pay
such
prices
to
humor
johanna
about
nine
the
trumpet
became
suddenly
dumb
papa
and
i
after
waiting
a
few
minutes
set
out
for
home
conjecturing
as
we
went
in
what
state
we
should
find
johanna
did
the
silence
mean
a
rupture
or
a
i
inclined
toward
the
rupture
for
how
can
a
girl
i
asked
papa
murmur
mild
words
of
to
a
lover
engaged
in
blowing
a
trumpet
papa
said
he
did
know
and
engrossed
by
fears
we
walked
home
without
speaking
no
one
was
to
be
seen
the
house
was
dark
and
empty
everything
was
quiet
except
the
crickets
the
trumpeter
had
gone
but
so
apparently
had
johanna
she
had
forgotten
to
lock
the
door
so
that
all
we
or
anybody
else
passing
that
way
had
to
do
was
to
walk
in
nobody
however
and
by
nobody
i
mean
the
criminally
intentioned
briefly
burglars
walks
into
houses
perched
as
ours
is
they
would
be
very
breathless
burglars
by
the
time
they
got
to
our
garden
gate
we
should
hear
their
stertorous
breathing
as
they
labored
up
well
in
time
to
lock
the
door
and
papa
ever
pitiful
and
polite
would
as
likely
as
not
unlock
it
again
to
hasten
out
and
offer
them
chairs
and
lemonade
it
was
not
then
with
any
misgivings
of
that
sort
that
we
went
into
our
deserted
house
and
felt
about
for
matches
but
i
was
surprised
that
johanna
when
she
could
sit
comfortably
level
on
the
seat
by
the
door
should
rather
choose
to
go
and
stroll
in
the
garden
you
can
not
stroll
in
my
garden
you
can
do
very
few
of
the
things
in
it
that
most
people
can
do
in
most
gardens
and
certainly
strolling
is
not
one
of
them
it
is
no
place
for
lovers
or
philosophers
or
leisurely
persons
of
the
sort
it
is
an
unrestful
place
in
which
you
are
forced
to
be
energetic
to
watch
where
you
put
your
feet
to
balance
yourself
to
a
nicety
to
be
continually
on
the
alert
i
lit
a
lantern
and
went
out
in
search
of
johanna
strolling
i
stood
on
the
back
door
steps
and
looked
right
and
looked
left
no
johanna
no
sounds
of
johanna
only
the
crickets
and
the
soft
darting
by
of
a
bat
i
went
down
the
steps
they
are
six
irregular
stones
embedded
one
beneath
the
other
in
the
clay
and
leading
to
the
pump
from
which
in
buckets
we
supply
our
need
for
water
and
standing
still
again
again
heard
only
crickets
i
went
to
the
mignonette
beds
i
have
made
mignonette
and
nasturtiums
mignonette
for
scent
and
nasturtiums
for
beauty
and
i
hope
you
like
nasturtiums
and
standing
still
again
again
heard
only
crickets
the
night
was
dark
and
soft
and
seemed
of
a
limitless
vastness
the
near
shrill
of
the
crickets
made
the
silence
beyond
more
intense
a
cat
prowled
past
silent
as
the
night
a
vanishing
gray
streak
intent
and
terrible
concentrated
wholly
on
prey
i
went
on
through
the
grass
my
shoes
wet
with
dew
the
lantern
light
fitfully
calling
out
my
possessions
from
the
blackness
the
three
the
the
pale
group
of
starworts
children
of
some
accidental
seed
of
long
ago
and
beside
the
starworts
i
stopped
again
and
listened
still
only
the
crickets
and
presently
very
far
away
the
whistle
of
the
night
express
from
berlin
to
munich
as
it
hurried
past
the
little
station
in
the
paradies
valley
it
was
extraordinarily
quiet
once
i
thought
my
own
were
the
footsteps
of
a
late
wanderer
on
the
road
i
went
further
down
to
the
very
end
to
the
place
where
my
beautiful
untiring
bush
unfolds
pink
flower
after
pink
flower
against
the
fence
that
separates
us
from
our
neighbor
kingdom
and
stopped
again
and
listened
at
first
still
only
crickets
and
the
anxious
twitter
of
a
bird
toward
whose
nest
that
stealthy
murderous
streak
of
gray
was
drawing
it
began
to
rain
soft
warm
drops
from
the
motionless
clouds
spread
low
across
the
sky
i
forgot
johanna
and
became
wholly
possessed
by
the
brooding
spirit
of
the
night
by
the
feeling
of
oneness
of
identity
with
the
darkness
the
silence
the
scent
my
feet
were
wet
with
dew
my
hair
with
the
warm
and
gentle
rain
i
lifted
up
my
face
and
let
the
drops
fall
on
it
through
the
leaves
of
the
warm
and
gentle
as
a
caress
then
the
sudden
blare
of
a
trumpet
made
me
start
and
quiver
i
quivered
so
much
that
the
lantern
fell
down
and
went
out
the
blare
was
the
loudest
noise
i
thought
i
had
ever
heard
ripping
up
the
silence
like
a
jagged
knife
the
startled
hills
could
get
over
it
but
went
on
echoing
and
it
tossing
it
backward
and
forward
to
each
other
in
an
endless
surprise
and
had
hardly
settled
down
again
with
a
kind
of
shudder
when
they
were
roused
to
frenzy
by
another
after
that
there
was
blare
upon
blare
the
man
only
stopped
to
take
breath
they
were
louder
more
rollicking
than
any
i
had
heard
him
produce
and
they
came
from
the
neighbor
house
from
the
very
dwelling
of
him
of
the
easily
tortured
ears
of
him
for
whom
wagner
is
not
good
enough
well
do
you
know
what
he
had
done
i
ran
down
to
question
and
to
extract
johanna
and
explain
the
trumpeter
and
i
met
the
poor
genius
very
pale
and
his
necktie
struggled
up
behind
to
the
top
of
his
collar
its
bow
twisted
round
somehow
under
his
left
ear
he
was
hurrying
out
into
the
night
as
i
arrived
panting
on
the
doorstep
in
the
world
i
began
but
a
blast
drowned
further
speech
he
flung
up
his
hands
and
the
darkness
engulfed
him
raining
i
tried
to
cry
after
his
hatless
figure
i
thought
i
heard
him
call
back
something
about
pilsner
the
pilsner
i
thought
i
heard
him
say
but
the
noise
coming
from
the
kitchen
was
too
violent
for
me
to
be
sure
his
father
was
in
the
passage
walking
up
and
down
it
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
shoulders
up
to
his
ears
as
though
he
were
shrinking
from
blows
he
told
me
what
his
unhappy
son
had
done
not
able
to
endure
the
trumpet
when
it
was
being
blown
up
at
our
house
earlier
in
the
evening
not
able
to
endure
it
even
softened
chastened
subdued
by
distance
and
the
intervening
walls
he
had
directed
his
mother
to
go
up
and
invite
the
player
down
to
her
kitchen
where
he
was
to
be
cajoled
into
eating
and
drinking
because
as
the
son
explained
full
of
glee
at
his
sagacity
no
man
who
is
eating
and
drinking
can
at
the
same
time
be
blowing
a
trumpet
said
his
father
in
jerks
coincident
with
the
of
the
trumpeter
he
hope
to
obtain
peace
he
did
said
i
for
a
period
there
was
extreme
delicious
quiet
mother
so
he
invariably
describes
his
wife
sacrificed
her
best
sausage
for
how
shall
we
permit
our
son
to
be
tortured
the
bread
was
spread
with
butter
three
centimeters
deep
the
trumpeter
and
his
sat
quietly
in
the
kitchen
eating
it
we
sat
quietly
on
the
veranda
discussing
great
themes
then
that
good
beer
my
son
so
often
praises
that
excellent
pilsner
beer
bright
as
amber
clear
as
ice
cool
as
cool
as
cucumber
i
assisted
very
good
as
a
cucumber
as
a
salad
of
cucumbers
no
there
pepper
in
a
salad
you
better
just
keep
to
plain
cucumber
i
interrupted
always
rather
nice
in
the
matter
of
images
then
as
plain
cucumber
this
usually
admirable
stuff
instead
of
as
we
had
expected
sending
him
gradually
and
pleasantly
to
sleep
i
mean
of
course
making
him
gradually
and
pleasantly
so
sleepy
that
thoughts
of
his
bed
growing
in
affection
with
every
glass
would
cause
him
to
arise
and
depart
to
his
barracks
woke
him
up
and
my
dear
fräulein
you
yourself
heard
you
are
hearing
now
how
completely
it
did
it
he
is
he
i
inquired
nervously
the
neighbor
nodded
is
he
said
has
consumed
fourteen
glasses
and
indeed
he
was
and
i
should
say
from
the
tumult
from
the
formlessness
of
it
the
tunelessness
the
rollicksomeness
that
never
was
anybody
more
so
fear
my
son
will
leave
us
for
some
quieter
spot
before
his
holiday
is
over
said
the
neighbor
looking
distressed
and
perhaps
it
will
convince
you
more
than
anything
else
i
have
said
of
the
extreme
value
of
our
johannas
when
i
tell
you
that
goaded
by
the
noise
and
by
his
disappointed
face
to
rash
promises
i
declared
i
would
dismiss
the
girl
unless
she
broke
off
such
an
engagement
and
he
stared
at
me
for
a
moment
in
astonishment
and
then
resignedly
shook
his
head
and
said
with
the
weary
conviction
of
a
householder
of
thirty
standing
geht
doch
yours
sincerely
schmidt
xliii
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
but
it
is
true
our
servants
do
not
get
more
than
from
to
marks
a
year
and
indeed
i
think
it
is
a
great
deal
and
can
not
see
why
because
you
spend
as
much
you
say
you
do
so
i
must
believe
it
in
a
month
on
gloves
and
ties
it
should
make
you
hate
yourself
do
not
hate
yourself
your
doing
so
does
make
us
pay
our
servants
more
why
how
do
you
suppose
we
could
get
all
we
need
out
of
our
hundred
pounds
a
year
i
translate
our
marks
into
your
pounds
for
your
greater
convenience
if
we
had
to
give
a
servant
more
than
eight
of
them
and
for
our
house
more
than
fifteen
papa
and
i
do
not
like
to
be
kept
hungry
in
the
matter
of
books
and
we
shall
probably
spend
every
penny
of
our
income
but
i
know
a
number
of
families
with
children
who
live
decently
and
have
occasional
and
put
by
for
their
daughters
on
the
same
sum
as
for
the
servants
themselves
have
i
not
described
johanna
splendid
appearance
on
her
sundays
her
white
dress
and
gloves
and
the
pink
ribbons
round
her
waist
she
finds
her
wages
will
buy
these
things
and
still
leave
enough
for
the
she
is
quite
content
only
i
do
know
if
she
would
remain
so
if
you
were
to
come
and
lament
over
her
and
tell
her
what
a
little
way
you
make
the
same
money
go
you
see
she
would
probably
not
grasp
the
true
significance
of
the
admission
which
is
i
take
it
not
that
she
has
too
little
but
that
you
spend
too
much
yet
how
can
i
from
my
galgenberg
judge
what
is
necessary
in
gloves
and
ties
for
a
splendid
young
man
like
yourself
the
sum
seems
to
me
terrific
there
must
be
stacks
of
gloves
and
ties
constantly
growing
higher
about
your
path
you
then
spend
on
these
two
things
alone
almost
exactly
what
we
three
spend
in
a
year
on
everything
but
my
astonishment
is
only
the
measure
of
my
ignorance
do
not
hate
yourself
either
spend
the
money
without
compunction
or
if
you
have
compunction
do
spend
it
a
sinner
should
always
i
think
sin
gayly
or
not
at
all
i
do
mean
that
you
in
this
are
a
sinner
i
only
mean
that
as
a
general
principle
sinners
are
contemptible
it
is
a
poor
creature
who
while
he
sins
is
sorry
if
he
must
sin
let
him
at
least
do
it
with
all
his
heart
and
having
done
it
waste
no
time
in
whimpers
but
try
to
turn
his
back
on
it
and
his
face
toward
the
good
please
do
not
hate
yourself
i
am
sure
you
have
to
have
the
things
your
letter
is
more
than
usually
depressed
please
do
not
hate
yourself
it
does
no
good
and
lowers
your
vitality
it
is
as
bad
as
sorrow
which
surely
is
very
bad
i
think
nothing
great
was
done
by
any
one
who
wasted
time
peering
about
among
his
faults
but
if
ever
you
meet
the
pastor
who
prepared
me
for
confirmation
do
tell
him
i
said
so
i
do
know
how
it
is
with
yours
in
england
but
here
the
pastors
seem
altogether
unable
to
bear
listening
to
descriptions
of
plain
facts
when
they
come
to
doctor
my
soul
why
may
i
not
tell
them
its
symptoms
as
badly
as
i
tell
my
symptoms
to
the
physician
who
would
heal
it
he
is
not
shocked
or
angry
when
i
show
him
my
sore
places
he
recommends
a
plaster
or
a
dose
encourages
and
goes
away
but
your
spiritual
doctor
takes
your
spiritual
sore
places
as
a
kind
of
personal
affront
at
least
his
manner
often
shows
indignation
in
proportion
as
you
are
frank
instead
of
being
patient
he
hardly
lets
you
speak
instead
of
prescribing
he
denounces
instead
of
helping
he
passionately
scolds
and
so
you
do
not
go
to
him
again
but
fight
through
your
later
miseries
alone
just
at
the
time
of
my
preparation
for
confirmation
my
mother
died
my
heart
blank
with
sorrow
was
very
fit
for
religious
impressions
and
consolations
the
preparation
lasts
two
years
and
three
times
every
week
during
that
time
i
went
to
classes
for
two
years
i
was
not
allowed
to
dance
or
to
go
to
even
the
mildest
parties
for
two
years
from
sixteen
to
eighteen
i
was
earnest
prayerful
humbly
seeking
after
righteousness
then
one
day
when
questionings
had
come
upon
me
that
my
conscience
could
not
approve
i
went
to
the
pastor
who
had
prepared
me
as
confidently
as
i
would
go
with
a
toothache
to
a
dentist
and
bared
my
sensitive
conscience
to
him
and
begged
to
have
my
thoughts
arranged
and
my
doubts
and
questionings
settled
to
my
amazement
and
extreme
fright
i
beheld
him
shocked
angry
hardly
able
to
endure
hearing
me
tell
all
i
had
been
wondering
it
seemed
very
strange
i
sat
at
last
with
downcast
eyes
silent
ashamed
my
heart
shrunk
back
into
reserve
and
frost
i
was
not
being
helped
i
was
being
scolded
and
bitterly
scolded
at
last
at
the
door
some
special
word
of
blame
stung
me
to
heat
and
i
cried
pastor
when
my
tongue
is
bad
and
i
show
it
to
a
doctor
he
gives
me
a
pill
are
you
not
the
doctor
of
my
spirit
why
then
when
i
come
to
you
to
be
healed
do
you
instead
of
giving
me
medicine
so
cruelly
rate
me
and
he
staring
at
me
a
moment
aghast
struck
his
hands
together
above
his
head
father
he
cried
father
it
is
he
who
speaks
it
is
he
speaking
in
thee
such
words
come
not
unaided
from
the
mouth
of
eighteen
from
the
mouth
of
one
confirmed
by
these
very
hands
miserable
maiden
it
is
not
with
such
as
thee
that
paradise
is
peopled
the
taint
of
thy
parentage
is
heavy
upon
thee
thou
art
not
thou
canst
not
be
thou
hast
never
been
a
child
of
god
and
that
was
all
i
got
for
my
pains
tell
me
what
mood
were
you
in
when
you
wrote
was
it
not
apart
from
its
dejection
one
rather
inclined
to
peevishness
you
ask
for
instance
why
i
write
so
much
about
a
tipsy
trumpeter
when
i
know
you
are
anxious
to
hear
about
the
other
things
i
never
tell
you
i
imagine
what
they
are
you
must
let
me
write
how
and
what
i
like
bear
with
me
while
i
discourse
of
roses
and
of
rain
and
sunshine
clouds
and
wind
cats
birds
servants
even
trumpeters
my
life
holds
nothing
greater
than
these
if
you
want
to
hear
from
me
you
must
hear
also
of
them
and
why
have
you
taken
so
bitter
a
dislike
to
our
gifted
young
neighbor
down
the
hill
calling
him
contemptuously
a
fiddler
he
is
certainly
a
fiddler
if
to
fiddle
in
one
hours
of
ease
produces
one
and
perhaps
you
would
be
twice
as
happy
as
you
are
if
you
could
fiddle
half
so
wonderfully
as
he
does
he
is
gone
his
holiday
either
came
to
an
end
or
was
put
to
an
end
by
johanna
now
in
these
early
september
days
this
season
of
mists
and
mellow
fruitfulness
of
cloudy
mornings
and
calm
evenings
and
golden
afternoons
he
has
turned
his
back
on
the
hills
and
forests
on
the
reddening
creepers
and
sweetening
grapes
on
the
splash
of
water
among
ferns
and
rocks
on
all
those
fresh
quiet
things
that
make
life
worth
having
and
is
sitting
at
a
desk
somewhere
in
berlin
doggedly
bent
on
becoming
by
means
of
a
great
outlay
of
days
and
years
a
a
a
and
a
geheimrath
mit
dem
prädikat
when
he
has
done
that
he
will
take
down
his
hat
and
go
forth
at
last
to
enjoy
life
and
will
find
to
his
surprise
that
it
is
there
that
it
is
all
behind
him
a
heap
of
dusty
days
piled
in
the
corners
of
offices
and
that
his
knees
shake
as
he
goes
about
looking
for
it
and
that
he
can
no
longer
even
tune
his
fiddle
by
himself
but
has
to
have
it
done
for
him
by
the
footman
is
that
what
happens
to
all
you
wise
men
so
prudently
determined
to
make
your
way
in
the
world
you
must
be
very
sure
of
another
life
or
how
could
you
bear
to
squander
this
the
things
you
are
missing
oh
the
things
you
are
missing
while
you
so
carefully
add
little
gain
to
little
gain
or
what
i
would
rather
call
little
loss
to
little
loss
i
see
no
point
in
slaving
day
after
day
through
one
best
years
suppose
you
do
not
in
the
end
have
a
footman
to
open
your
door
the
footman
is
merely
a
symbol
conveniently
expressing
the
multitude
of
superfluities
that
gather
about
the
declining
years
of
the
person
who
has
got
on
things
bought
with
the
sacrifice
of
his
life
and
none
of
them
giving
him
back
the
lost
power
gone
with
youth
to
enjoy
them
suppose
then
you
do
not
end
gloriously
with
a
footman
what
of
that
i
must
be
blind
for
i
never
can
see
the
desirability
of
these
trappings
yet
they
surely
are
of
an
immense
desirability
since
everybody
really
everybody
is
willing
to
give
so
much
in
payment
for
them
our
elder
neighbor
down
the
hill
has
actually
given
his
eyes
and
his
back
he
peers
at
life
through
spectacles
and
walks
about
like
wordsworth
bent
double
through
poking
about
for
years
in
the
muddy
pools
of
little
boys
badly
written
exercises
and
here
he
is
at
fifty
still
not
satisfied
with
what
he
has
earned
still
going
on
drudging
the
whole
year
round
except
for
his
six
short
weeks
in
summer
his
wife
is
thrifty
they
have
only
the
one
son
they
live
frugally
long
ago
they
must
have
put
by
enough
to
keep
them
warm
and
fed
and
clothed
without
his
doing
another
stroke
of
work
i
was
interrupted
there
by
a
message
from
him
asking
if
i
would
come
down
and
help
him
gather
up
the
windfalls
in
his
orchard
his
wife
being
busy
pickling
beans
i
went
my
head
full
of
what
i
had
just
been
writing
to
you
and
i
gathered
up
together
with
the
apples
a
little
lesson
in
the
foolishness
of
officious
and
hasty
criticism
it
was
this
way
our
baskets
being
full
and
our
backs
rested
he
groaned
and
said
that
in
another
week
he
must
leave
for
weimar
you
like
your
work
said
i
detest
my
work
he
said
peevishly
detest
teaching
i
detest
little
boys
why
i
began
but
stopped
why
because
i
detest
it
is
no
reason
why
i
should
not
do
it
it
is
and
at
my
age
begin
another
no
would
not
have
me
idle
i
would
he
stared
at
me
gravely
through
his
spectacles
is
unprincipled
he
said
i
laughed
it
is
years
since
i
have
observed
that
the
principled
groan
a
good
deal
and
make
discontented
criticisms
of
life
and
i
do
think
i
care
to
be
one
of
them
is
he
persisted
seeing
that
i
only
laughed
it
said
i
is
man
lot
to
work
said
he
it
said
i
said
he
day
he
can
not
get
it
done
in
less
time
certainly
day
through
the
years
of
his
life
through
the
years
of
his
strength
certainly
for
dear
young
lady
have
you
been
living
again
on
vegetables
lately
words
sound
as
though
your
thoughts
were
watery
a
nettled
silence
fell
upon
me
and
while
i
was
arranging
how
best
to
convince
him
of
their
substance
he
was
shaking
his
head
and
saying
that
it
was
strange
how
the
most
intelligent
women
are
unable
really
to
think
he
continued
indispensable
in
its
proper
place
and
good
in
many
others
where
strictly
it
might
be
done
without
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
watery
emotions
watery
sentiments
even
watery
affections
especially
in
ladies
who
would
be
less
charming
in
proportion
as
they
were
more
rigid
ebb
and
flow
uncertainty
instability
unaccountableness
are
becoming
to
your
sex
but
in
the
region
of
thought
of
the
intellect
of
pure
reason
everything
should
be
very
dry
the
one
place
my
dear
young
lady
in
which
i
will
endure
no
water
is
on
the
brain
i
had
no
answer
ready
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
left
to
do
but
to
go
home
i
did
go
a
few
steps
up
the
orchard
reflecting
on
the
way
men
have
of
telling
you
you
can
not
think
or
are
not
logical
at
the
very
moment
when
you
appear
to
yourself
to
be
most
unanswerable
a
regrettable
habit
that
at
once
puts
a
stop
to
interesting
conversation
and
presently
as
i
was
nearing
our
fence
he
called
after
me
he
called
pleasantly
said
i
looking
down
at
him
over
a
displeased
shoulder
back
back
and
dine
with
us
is
mutton
for
dinner
and
before
that
a
soup
full
of
the
concentrated
strength
of
beasts
up
there
i
know
you
will
eat
carrots
and
stewed
apples
and
i
shall
never
be
able
to
make
you
see
what
i
see
forbid
that
i
ever
should
you
do
not
desire
to
be
reasonable
do
choose
to
argue
with
you
i
done
anything
are
not
logical
enough
for
me
said
i
anxious
to
be
beforehand
with
the
inevitable
remark
come
said
he
his
face
crinkling
into
smiles
true
said
i
back
and
prove
it
can
not
will
not
is
the
same
thing
i
went
on
up
the
hill
back
back
and
tell
me
why
you
think
i
ought
to
give
up
my
work
and
sit
for
the
rest
of
my
days
with
hanging
hands
i
turned
and
looked
down
at
him
i
said
you
not
fifty
and
is
not
that
high
time
to
begin
and
get
something
out
of
life
he
adjusted
his
spectacles
and
stared
up
at
me
attentively
he
said
look
at
your
life
at
all
those
fifty
years
of
it
and
i
see
it
insufferably
monotonous
he
nodded
his
head
gently
at
each
adjective
and
counted
them
off
on
his
fingers
see
it
full
of
grammars
and
little
boys
is
a
constant
going
over
the
same
ground
in
itself
a
maddening
process
no
sooner
do
the
boys
reach
a
certain
age
and
proficiency
and
become
slightly
more
interesting
than
they
go
on
to
somebody
else
and
you
begin
again
at
the
beginning
with
another
batch
you
teach
in
a
room
with
enormous
glaring
windows
and
the
ring
of
the
electric
in
the
street
below
makes
the
commas
in
your
sentences
you
have
been
doing
this
every
day
for
thirty
years
the
boys
you
taught
at
first
are
fathers
of
families
now
the
trees
in
the
playground
have
grown
from
striplings
into
big
shady
things
everything
has
gone
on
and
so
have
you
but
you
have
only
gone
on
getting
drier
and
more
bored
said
he
smiling
intelligence
said
i
coming
down
a
little
nearer
at
first
and
for
ever
trying
to
push
green
shoots
through
the
thick
rind
of
routine
quite
good
continue
through
to
a
wider
space
a
more
generous
light
quite
poetic
my
compliments
you
your
intelligence
then
for
ever
for
ever
interrupted
me
and
i
do
know
where
i
got
to
have
got
to
my
intelligence
having
green
shoots
yes
well
they
not
green
now
that
the
point
i
been
stumbling
toward
they
ought
to
be
if
you
had
taken
bigger
handfuls
of
leisure
and
had
not
wholly
wasted
your
time
drudging
but
now
they
ought
to
be
more
than
shoots
great
trees
in
whose
shade
we
all
would
sit
gratefully
and
you
enjoying
free
days
with
the
pleasant
memory
of
free
years
behind
you
and
the
cheerful
hope
of
roomy
years
to
come
and
during
all
that
time
of
your
imprisonment
in
a
the
world
outside
went
on
its
splendid
way
the
seasons
filled
it
with
beauty
which
you
were
not
there
to
see
the
sun
shone
and
warmed
other
people
the
winds
blew
and
made
other
people
flesh
tingle
and
their
blood
dance
you
of
course
were
cramped
up
with
cold
feet
and
a
headache
the
birds
sang
to
other
people
tunes
of
heaven
while
in
your
ears
buzzed
only
the
false
quantities
of
reluctant
little
boys
the
delicious
rain
stop
you
forget
i
had
to
earn
a
living
course
you
had
but
you
know
you
earned
your
long
ago
what
you
are
earning
now
is
much
more
like
your
dying
the
dying
the
atrophy
of
your
soul
what
does
it
matter
if
your
wife
has
one
bonnet
less
a
year
and
no
silk
dress
not
let
her
hear
you
he
said
glancing
or
if
you
keep
no
servant
and
have
less
to
eat
on
sundays
than
your
neighbors
give
no
parties
and
do
cumber
yourselves
up
with
acquaintances
who
care
nothing
for
you
if
you
gave
up
these
things
you
could
also
give
up
drudging
you
are
too
old
to
drudge
you
have
been
too
old
these
twenty
years
a
man
of
your
brains
he
pretended
to
look
grateful
can
not
earn
enough
between
twenty
and
thirty
to
keep
him
from
the
necessity
of
slaving
for
the
rest
of
his
days
is
not
is
not
of
the
name
of
man
do
know
that
that
a
great
thing
said
i
doubtfully
it
pass
it
is
an
accepted
ending
to
a
sentence
beginning
as
yours
did
and
now
my
dear
young
lady
you
have
preached
me
a
sermon
a
sermon
me
then
to
be
present
at
a
lecture
a
lecture
held
forth
on
the
unworthily
puny
outer
conditions
of
my
existence
tell
me
now
one
thing
i
concede
the
the
little
boys
the
monotony
the
the
regrettable
number
of
years
they
are
all
there
and
you
with
your
vivid
imagination
see
them
all
but
tell
me
one
thing
has
it
never
occurred
to
you
that
they
are
the
merest
shell
the
merest
husk
and
envelopment
and
that
it
is
possible
that
in
spite
of
them
his
voice
grew
serious
life
may
be
very
rich
within
and
you
my
friend
tell
me
another
thing
am
i
not
desperately
hopelessly
horrid
impertinent
the
readiest
jumper
at
conclusions
the
most
arrogant
critic
of
other
people
rich
within
of
course
hidden
with
god
that
is
what
i
have
never
seen
when
i
have
looked
on
superciliously
from
the
height
of
my
own
idleness
at
these
drudging
lives
and
see
how
amazing
has
been
my
foolishness
for
would
not
my
own
life
judged
from
outside
this
life
here
alone
with
papa
this
restricted
poor
solitary
life
my
first
youth
gone
my
future
without
prospects
no
distractions
few
friends
papa
affection
growing
vaguer
as
he
grows
older
would
it
not
looked
at
as
i
have
been
looking
at
my
neighbor
seem
entirely
blank
and
desolate
yet
how
sincerely
can
i
echo
what
he
said
my
life
is
very
rich
within
yours
sincerely
schmidt
xliv
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
it
is
kind
of
you
to
want
to
contradict
what
i
said
in
my
last
letter
about
the
outward
appearance
of
my
life
but
really
you
know
i
past
my
first
youth
at
i
can
not
pretend
to
be
what
is
known
as
a
young
girl
and
i
do
want
to
not
for
anything
would
i
be
seventeen
or
eighteen
again
i
like
to
be
a
woman
grown
to
have
entered
into
the
full
possession
of
whatever
faculties
i
am
to
have
to
know
what
i
want
to
look
at
things
in
their
true
proportions
i
do
know
that
eighteen
has
anything
that
compensates
for
that
it
is
such
a
rudderless
sort
of
age
it
may
be
more
charming
to
the
beholder
but
it
is
not
half
so
nice
to
the
person
herself
what
is
the
good
of
loving
chocolate
to
distraction
when
it
only
ends
by
making
you
sick
and
the
joy
of
a
new
frock
or
hat
is
dashed
at
once
when
you
meet
the
superior
gorgeousness
of
some
other
girl
frock
or
hat
and
parties
are
often
disappointing
things
and
students
though
they
are
deeply
interesting
easily
lead
to
tiresome
complications
if
they
admire
you
and
if
they
do
that
is
very
nice
either
why
even
the
young
man
in
the
who
used
so
gallantly
to
serve
us
with
lemonade
and
had
such
wonderful
curly
eyelashes
was
not
much
good
really
for
he
could
be
invited
to
tea
and
whenever
we
wanted
to
look
at
his
eyelashes
we
had
to
buy
a
cake
and
cakes
are
dreadfully
expensive
for
persons
who
have
no
money
yes
it
is
a
silly
tittering
age
and
i
am
glad
it
ca
come
back
again
please
do
not
think
that
i
need
comforting
because
it
is
gone
or
because
of
any
of
the
other
items
in
the
list
i
gave
you
the
future
looks
quite
pleasant
to
me
quite
bright
and
sunny
it
is
only
empty
of
what
people
call
prospects
by
which
i
take
them
to
mean
husbands
but
i
shall
fill
it
with
pigs
instead
i
have
great
plans
i
see
what
can
be
done
with
even
one
pig
from
my
neighbor
example
who
has
dug
out
a
sort
of
terrace
and
put
a
sty
on
it
simply
wonders
and
how
much
more
could
be
done
with
two
i
mean
to
be
a
very
happy
old
maid
i
shall
fix
my
attention
in
the
mornings
on
remunerative
objects
like
pigs
and
spend
beautiful
afternoons
quite
idle
physically
but
with
my
soul
busy
up
among
the
poets
later
on
in
distant
years
when
papa
does
want
me
any
more
i
shall
try
to
find
a
little
house
somewhere
where
it
is
flat
so
that
i
can
have
other
creatures
about
me
besides
bees
which
are
the
only
live
stock
i
can
keep
here
and
you
must
think
i
shall
not
be
happy
because
i
shall
i
am
happy
now
and
i
mean
to
be
happy
then
and
when
i
am
very
old
and
have
to
die
i
shall
be
happy
about
that
too
i
shall
me
down
with
a
will
as
the
bravest
of
your
countrymen
sang
do
my
plans
seem
to
you
selfish
i
expect
they
do
people
so
easily
call
those
selfish
who
stand
a
little
aside
and
look
on
at
life
we
have
a
poet
of
whom
we
are
proud
but
whose
fame
has
not
i
think
reached
across
to
england
a
rugged
robust
poet
not
very
far
below
goethe
a
painter
on
large
canvasses
best
at
mighty
scenes
perhaps
least
good
in
small
things
in
lyrics
in
the
things
in
which
heine
was
so
exquisite
and
he
for
my
encouragement
has
said
bei
sich
selber
fangt
man
an
da
man
nicht
allen
helfen
kann
is
it
a
nice
jingle
the
man
name
is
hebbel
and
he
lived
round
about
the
forties
and
perhaps
you
know
more
of
him
than
i
do
and
i
have
been
arrogant
again
but
it
is
a
jingle
that
has
often
cheered
me
when
i
was
afraid
i
ought
to
be
teaching
somebody
something
or
making
clothes
for
somebody
or
paying
somebody
domiciliary
visits
and
talking
fluently
of
the
i
shrink
from
these
things
and
a
shrinking
visitor
shy
and
uncertain
can
not
be
so
nice
as
no
visitor
at
all
is
it
very
wrong
of
me
when
my
conscience
says
it
is
it
does
not
say
so
often
i
try
to
make
up
by
going
into
the
kitchen
and
asking
johanna
kind
questions
about
her
mother
i
must
say
she
is
rather
odd
when
i
do
she
not
only
does
meet
me
she
does
come
even
part
of
the
way
she
clatters
her
saucepans
with
an
energy
very
like
fury
and
grows
wholly
monosyllabic
yet
it
is
not
her
it
is
her
very
own
mother
and
it
ought
to
be
the
best
way
of
touching
responsive
chords
in
her
heart
and
making
her
feel
i
am
not
merely
a
mistress
but
a
friend
once
struck
by
the
way
the
lids
of
the
saucepans
were
falling
about
i
tried
her
with
her
father
but
the
din
instantly
became
so
terrific
that
i
was
kept
silent
quite
a
long
time
and
when
it
left
off
felt
instinctively
that
i
had
better
say
something
about
the
weather
i
do
think
i
told
you
that
after
that
trumpeting
sunday
moved
to
real
compassion
by
the
sufferings
of
him
you
call
the
fiddler
man
i
took
my
courage
in
both
hands
and
told
johanna
with
the
pleasantest
of
smiles
i
daresay
it
was
really
a
rather
ghastly
one
that
her
trumpeter
must
not
again
bring
his
instrument
with
him
when
he
called
can
so
very
well
stay
at
home
i
explained
suavely
she
immediately
said
she
would
leave
on
the
first
of
october
johanna
i
cried
she
repeated
the
formula
johanna
how
can
a
clever
girl
like
you
be
so
unreasonable
he
is
to
visit
you
as
often
as
before
all
we
beg
is
that
it
shall
be
done
without
music
she
repeated
the
formula
johanna
i
expostulated
again
eloquent
exclamation
expressing
the
most
varied
sentiments
she
once
again
repeated
the
formula
and
next
day
i
was
forced
to
descend
into
jena
shaking
an
extremely
rueful
fist
at
the
house
on
the
way
and
set
about
searching
in
the
obscurity
of
a
registry
office
for
the
pearl
we
are
trying
all
our
lives
to
find
this
office
consists
of
two
rooms
the
first
filled
with
servants
looking
for
mistresses
and
the
second
with
mistresses
looking
for
servants
a
fräulein
of
vague
age
but
determined
bearing
sits
at
a
desk
in
the
second
room
and
notes
in
a
ledger
the
requirements
of
both
parties
they
are
always
the
same
the
mistress
full
of
a
hopefulness
that
crops
up
again
and
again
to
the
end
of
her
days
causing
attributes
like
treu
ehrlich
anständig
arbeitslieb
to
be
written
down
together
with
her
demands
in
cooking
starching
and
ironing
and
often
adding
the
information
that
though
the
wages
may
appear
small
they
are
not
really
so
owing
to
the
unusually
superior
quality
of
the
treatment
and
the
maid
briefer
because
without
illusions
dictates
her
firm
resolve
to
go
nowhere
where
there
is
cooking
washing
or
a
baby
diese
exclaimed
a
waiting
lady
to
me
as
i
arrived
hot
and
ruffled
after
my
long
tramp
in
the
sun
i
dropped
into
a
chair
beside
her
and
hot
and
ruffled
as
i
was
she
who
had
been
sitting
there
hours
was
still
more
so
in
her
agitation
she
had
cried
out
to
the
first
human
being
at
hand
the
fräulein
at
the
desk
having
something
too
distinctly
inhuman
about
her
strange
as
a
result
of
her
long
and
intimate
intercourse
with
human
beings
to
be
lightly
applied
to
for
sympathy
then
looking
at
me
again
she
cried
it
is
the
good
and
i
saw
she
was
an
old
friend
of
my
frau
meyer
the
wife
of
one
of
the
doctors
at
the
lunatic
asylum
who
used
to
come
in
often
while
you
were
with
us
and
whenever
she
came
in
you
went
out
married
yet
she
asked
as
we
shook
hands
smiling
as
though
the
joke
were
good
i
smiled
with
an
equal
conviction
of
its
goodness
and
said
i
was
not
even
engaged
even
engaged
said
i
smiling
more
broadly
as
if
infinitely
tickled
must
be
quick
said
she
i
admitted
the
necessity
by
a
nod
are
i
know
your
age
because
poor
emilie
emilie
was
my
married
ten
years
and
when
she
married
you
were
sixteen
is
a
great
age
for
a
girl
when
i
was
your
age
i
had
already
had
four
children
what
do
you
think
of
that
i
did
know
what
to
think
of
it
so
smiled
vaguely
and
turning
to
the
waiting
machine
at
the
desk
began
my
list
clean
honest
yes
if
we
could
but
find
such
treasures
interrupted
frau
meyer
with
a
reverberating
sigh
am
i
engaged
to
give
the
first
of
the
season
in
summer
is
not
summer
in
september
if
the
weather
chooses
to
pretend
it
is
i
can
not
help
it
it
is
autumn
and
i
will
no
longer
endure
the
want
of
social
gatherings
invariably
i
find
the
time
between
the
last
coffee
of
spring
and
the
first
of
autumn
almost
unendurable
what
do
you
do
up
there
on
that
horrible
mountain
of
yours
to
pass
the
time
pass
the
time
i
who
am
so
much
afraid
of
time
passing
me
that
i
try
to
catch
at
him
as
he
goes
pull
him
back
make
him
creep
slowly
while
i
squeeze
the
full
preciousness
out
of
every
minute
i
gazed
at
her
abstractedly
haunted
by
the
recollection
of
flying
days
days
gone
so
quickly
vanished
before
i
well
knew
how
happy
i
was
being
really
could
tell
you
i
said
clean
honest
read
out
the
fräulein
reminding
me
that
i
was
busy
i
dictated
to
wash
will
never
find
one
interrupted
frau
meyer
again
least
never
one
who
is
both
moral
and
able
to
two
good
things
do
go
together
with
these
girls
i
find
the
trouble
i
am
in
for
want
of
one
they
are
as
scarce
and
as
expensive
as
roses
in
december
since
april
i
have
had
three
and
all
had
to
leave
by
the
merest
accident
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
place
or
me
but
the
ones
in
there
seem
to
know
there
have
been
three
in
the
time
and
make
the
most
extravagant
demands
i
have
been
here
the
whole
morning
and
am
in
despair
she
stopped
to
fan
herself
with
her
handkerchief
to
wash
i
resumed
cook
mend
have
you
any
one
suitable
fräulein
was
the
laconic
answer
afraid
we
can
not
give
more
than
a
hundred
and
sixty
marks
said
i
said
frau
meyer
and
there
was
a
pause
in
the
scratching
of
the
pen
there
are
no
children
i
continued
the
pen
went
on
more
glibly
frau
meyer
fanned
herself
harder
only
two
the
pen
skimmed
over
the
paper
live
up
we
live
up
on
the
galgenberg
the
pen
stopped
dead
will
never
find
one
who
will
go
up
there
cried
frau
meyer
triumphantly
need
not
fear
your
taking
a
good
one
away
from
me
they
will
not
leave
the
town
the
fräulein
rang
a
bell
and
called
out
a
name
is
another
one
for
you
frau
doctor
she
said
and
a
large
young
lady
came
in
from
the
other
room
general
servant
fräulein
ottilie
krummacher
frau
doctor
meyer
introduced
the
fräulein
think
you
may
suit
each
other
is
time
you
showed
me
some
one
who
will
groaned
frau
meyer
have
i
already
interviewed
and
the
demands
of
all
are
enough
to
make
my
mother
who
was
frau
gutsbesitzer
grosskopf
of
the
grosskopfs
of
grosskopfsecke
born
knoblauch
and
a
lady
of
the
most
exact
knowledge
in
household
matters
turn
in
her
grave
asked
the
large
girl
quickly
hardly
allowing
frau
meyer
to
get
to
a
full
stop
and
obviously
callous
as
to
the
grosskopfs
of
grosskopfsecke
yes
here
overlooking
the
and
the
interesting
statue
of
the
electoral
founder
of
the
university
no
way
to
go
therefore
to
market
enlivening
scenes
constantly
visible
from
the
windows
floor
shallow
steps
and
a
nice
balustrade
really
hardly
higher
than
the
first
floor
or
even
than
an
ordinary
ground
floor
the
rooms
being
very
low
out
of
the
house
except
the
smallest
fewest
trifles
such
as
such
as
ahem
the
ironing
dear
fräulein
i
will
do
mostly
myself
there
are
the
shirts
you
know
husbands
are
particular
many
many
echoed
frau
meyer
many
what
fräulein
expostulated
the
secretary
said
husbands
said
the
large
girl
then
how
many
all
the
same
the
same
cried
frau
meyer
who
adored
her
husband
the
work
it
makes
dear
fräulein
the
shirts
are
not
washed
at
home
ironed
iron
them
i
heat
the
irons
and
keep
up
the
fire
to
heat
them
with
yes
cried
frau
meyer
affecting
the
extreme
pleasure
of
one
who
has
just
received
an
eager
assurance
you
do
the
large
girl
stared
she
inquired
after
a
slightly
stony
pause
of
that
i
will
do
myself
also
the
herr
is
very
particular
i
shall
only
need
a
little
quite
a
little
assistance
and
think
of
all
the
new
and
excellent
dishes
you
will
learn
to
make
the
girl
waved
this
last
inducement
aside
as
unworthy
of
consideration
of
persons
in
the
household
frau
meyer
coughed
before
she
could
answer
said
she
well
there
is
my
husband
and
naturally
myself
and
then
there
are
there
are
are
you
fond
of
children
she
ended
hastily
the
girl
fixed
her
with
a
suspicious
eye
depends
how
many
there
are
she
said
cautiously
frau
meyer
got
up
and
leaned
over
the
fräulein
at
the
desk
and
whispered
into
her
impassive
ear
the
fräulein
shook
her
head
am
afraid
it
is
no
use
she
said
frau
meyer
whispered
again
the
fräulein
looked
up
and
fastening
her
eyes
on
a
point
somewhere
below
the
large
girl
chin
said
wages
are
good
are
they
asked
the
girl
the
treatment
you
will
receive
the
girl
eyes
again
became
suspicious
are
excellent
are
they
found
and
a
hundred
and
eighty
marks
a
year
the
girl
turned
and
walked
toward
the
door
stop
cried
frau
meyer
desperately
can
not
see
you
throw
away
a
good
place
with
so
little
preliminary
reflection
have
you
considered
that
there
would
be
no
trudging
to
market
and
consequently
you
will
only
require
half
the
boots
and
stockings
and
skirts
those
poor
girls
have
to
buy
who
live
up
in
the
villas
that
look
so
grand
and
pretend
to
give
such
high
wages
the
girl
paused
no
steep
stairs
to
climb
laden
with
heavy
baskets
and
hardly
any
washing
hardly
any
washing
i
tell
you
she
almost
shrieked
in
her
anxiety
no
cooking
to
speak
of
and
every
sunday
mind
sunday
evening
free
and
i
never
scold
and
my
husband
never
scolds
and
with
a
hundred
and
eighty
marks
a
year
there
is
nothing
a
clever
girl
can
not
buy
why
it
is
an
ideal
a
delightful
place
one
at
which
i
would
jump
if
i
were
a
girl
and
this
lady
indicating
me
jump
too
would
you
not
the
girl
wavered
many
children
are
there
she
asked
children
angels
you
mean
they
are
perfect
angels
so
good
and
are
they
not
fit
to
go
at
once
to
heaven
without
a
day
more
training
so
little
would
they
differ
in
manner
when
they
got
there
from
angels
who
have
been
used
to
it
for
years
you
are
fond
of
children
fräulein
i
am
sure
naturally
you
are
i
see
it
in
your
nice
face
no
nice
fräulein
is
not
and
these
i
tell
you
are
such
unusual
many
are
there
there
are
only
six
and
so
small
still
that
they
can
hardly
be
counted
as
six
six
of
the
dearest
the
girl
turned
on
her
heel
can
not
be
fond
of
six
she
said
and
went
out
with
the
heavy
tread
of
finality
frau
meyer
looked
at
me
now
she
said
in
tones
of
real
despair
is
very
tiresome
said
i
sympathizing
the
more
acutely
that
i
knew
my
turn
was
coming
next
it
is
terrible
in
two
days
i
have
my
coffee
and
no
and
no
and
no
she
burst
into
tears
hiding
her
face
from
the
dispassionate
stare
of
the
fräulein
at
the
desk
in
her
handkerchief
and
trying
to
conceal
her
sobs
by
a
ceaseless
blowing
of
her
nose
am
so
sorry
i
murmured
touched
by
this
utter
melting
an
impulse
seized
me
on
which
i
instantly
acted
johanna
i
cried
her
for
that
day
she
will
at
least
get
you
over
that
she
is
excellent
at
a
party
and
knows
all
about
coffees
i
send
her
down
early
and
you
keep
her
as
late
as
you
like
she
would
enjoy
the
outing
and
we
can
manage
quite
well
for
one
day
without
her
that
is
that
the
johanna
you
had
in
the
rauchgasse
trained
by
my
really
good
in
an
emergency
frau
meyer
flung
her
arms
round
my
neck
danke
danke
du
liebes
gutes
she
cried
embracing
me
with
a
warmth
that
showed
me
what
heaps
of
people
she
must
have
asked
to
her
party
and
i
after
the
first
flush
of
doing
a
good
deed
was
over
and
cool
reflection
had
resumed
its
sway
which
it
did
by
the
time
i
was
toiling
up
the
hill
on
the
way
home
after
having
been
unanimously
rejected
as
mistress
by
the
assembled
maidens
i
repented
for
was
not
johanna
now
my
only
hope
meyer
whispered
reflection
in
my
despondent
ear
engage
her
to
go
to
her
permanently
on
the
and
she
will
go
because
of
the
twenty
marks
more
salary
you
have
been
silly
of
course
she
would
have
stayed
with
you
with
a
little
persuasion
rather
than
have
to
look
for
another
place
and
spend
her
money
at
a
it
is
not
likely
however
that
she
will
refuse
a
situation
costing
her
nothing
but
see
how
true
it
sometimes
is
that
virtue
is
rewarded
johanna
went
down
as
i
had
promised
and
worked
all
day
for
frau
meyer
she
was
given
a
thaler
as
a
present
as
much
cake
and
coffee
as
she
could
consume
and
received
the
offer
of
a
permanent
engagement
when
she
should
leave
us
this
she
told
me
standing
by
my
bedside
late
that
night
the
candle
in
her
hand
lighting
up
her
heated
shining
face
and
hair
dishevelled
by
exertion
said
she
not
for
the
world
would
i
take
the
place
such
a
restless
lady
such
a
nervous
gentleman
such
numbers
of
spoilt
and
sprawling
children
if
i
had
not
been
there
today
and
beheld
it
from
the
inside
i
would
have
engaged
myself
to
go
but
after
this
she
waved
the
candle
are
you
going
to
do
then
johanna
i
asked
thinking
wistfully
of
the
four
years
we
had
passed
together
here
she
announced
defiantly
i
put
my
arms
round
her
neck
and
kissed
her
yours
sincerely
schmidt
xlv
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
today
i
went
down
to
jena
with
the
girl
from
next
door
who
wanted
to
do
such
mild
shopping
as
jena
is
prepared
for
mild
shopping
suited
to
mild
purses
and
there
i
drifted
into
the
bookshop
in
the
where
i
so
often
used
to
drift
and
there
i
found
a
book
dealing
with
english
poetry
from
chaucer
onward
with
pictures
of
the
poets
who
had
written
it
but
before
i
go
on
about
that
and
be
surprised
at
the
amount
i
have
to
say
i
must
explain
the
girl
next
door
i
do
think
i
ever
told
you
that
there
is
one
the
neighbor
let
his
house
just
before
he
left
and
let
it
unexpectedly
well
the
people
taking
the
upper
part
of
it
for
a
whole
year
and
this
is
their
daughter
the
neighbor
went
off
jubilant
to
his
little
inky
boys
said
he
at
parting
life
actually
threatens
to
become
rich
without
as
well
as
within
i
murmured
turning
as
hot
as
people
do
when
they
are
reminded
of
past
foolishness
the
new
neighbors
have
been
here
ten
days
and
i
made
friends
at
once
with
the
girl
over
the
fence
she
saw
me
gathering
together
into
one
miserable
haycock
the
september
grass
johanna
and
i
had
been
hacking
at
in
turns
with
a
sickle
for
the
last
week
and
stood
watching
me
with
so
evident
an
interest
that
at
last
i
could
help
smiling
at
her
is
our
crop
for
the
winter
i
said
pointing
to
the
haycock
i
protest
i
have
seen
many
a
molehill
bigger
is
much
said
the
girl
i
agreed
raking
busily
you
a
cow
she
asked
pig
animals
the
girl
was
silent
then
she
said
bees
were
not
animals
they
i
said
the
one
link
that
connects
us
with
farming
do
you
make
hay
for
then
to
keep
the
grass
short
and
then
we
try
to
imagine
it
a
lawn
raking
i
came
a
little
nearer
and
so
i
saw
she
had
been
quite
recently
crying
i
looked
at
her
more
attentively
she
was
pretty
with
the
prettiness
of
twenty
round
and
soft
fair
and
smooth
she
had
on
an
elaborately
masculine
shirt
and
high
stiff
collar
and
tie
and
pin
and
belt
and
from
under
the
edge
of
the
hard
straw
hat
tilted
up
at
the
back
by
masses
of
burnished
coils
of
hair
i
saw
a
pulpy
red
mouth
the
tip
of
an
indeterminate
nose
and
two
unhappy
eyes
tired
with
crying
early
to
begin
i
said
what
not
nine
yet
do
you
always
get
your
crying
done
by
breakfast
time
she
flushed
all
over
her
face
me
i
said
industriously
raking
a
rude
person
the
girl
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
considering
i
suppose
whether
she
should
turn
her
back
on
the
impertinent
stranger
once
and
for
all
or
forgive
the
indiscretion
and
make
friends
well
she
made
friends
she
and
i
alone
up
on
the
hill
the
only
creatures
of
anything
like
the
same
age
sure
to
see
each
other
continually
in
the
forests
on
the
road
over
the
fence
certainly
we
were
bound
either
to
a
tiresome
system
of
pretending
to
be
unaware
of
each
other
existence
or
to
be
friends
we
are
friends
it
is
the
wisest
thing
to
be
at
all
times
in
ten
days
we
have
become
fast
friends
and
after
the
first
six
she
left
off
crying
now
i
tell
you
why
we
have
done
it
so
quickly
it
is
not
as
perhaps
you
know
my
practice
to
fall
easily
on
the
stranger
neck
i
am
too
lumbering
too
slow
too
acutely
conscious
of
my
shortcomings
for
that
really
too
dull
and
too
awkward
for
anything
but
a
life
almost
entirely
solitary
but
this
girl
has
lately
been
in
love
it
is
the
common
fate
it
happens
to
us
all
that
in
itself
would
not
stir
me
to
friendship
the
man
however
in
defiance
of
german
custom
so
strong
on
this
point
that
the
breaking
of
it
makes
a
terrific
noise
after
being
publicly
engaged
to
her
after
letting
things
go
so
far
that
the
new
flat
was
furnished
and
the
bidden
said
he
was
afraid
he
love
her
enough
and
gave
her
up
when
she
told
me
that
my
heart
went
out
to
her
with
a
rush
i
shall
not
stop
to
explain
why
but
it
did
rush
and
from
that
moment
i
felt
that
i
must
put
my
arms
round
her
i
the
elder
and
quieter
take
her
by
the
hand
help
her
to
dry
her
poor
silly
eyes
pet
her
and
make
her
happy
again
and
really
after
six
days
there
was
no
more
crying
and
for
the
last
three
she
has
been
looking
at
life
with
something
of
the
critical
indifference
that
lifts
one
over
so
many
tiresome
bits
of
the
road
unfortunately
her
mother
does
like
me
do
you
think
it
dreadful
of
her
not
to
she
fears
i
am
emancipated
and
knows
that
i
am
schmidt
if
i
were
a
wedel
or
an
alvensleben
or
a
schulenburg
or
of
any
other
ancient
noble
family
even
an
obscure
member
of
its
remotest
branch
she
would
consider
my
way
of
living
and
talking
merely
as
a
thing
to
be
smiled
at
with
kind
indulgence
but
she
knows
that
i
am
schmidt
nothing
i
can
say
or
do
however
sweet
and
sane
can
hide
that
horrid
fact
and
she
knows
that
my
father
is
a
careless
child
of
nature
lamentably
unimpressible
by
birth
and
office
that
my
mother
was
an
englishwoman
with
a
name
inspiring
little
confidence
and
that
we
let
ourselves
go
to
an
indecent
indifference
to
appearances
not
even
trying
to
conceal
that
we
are
poor
how
useless
it
is
to
be
pleasant
and
pretty
i
really
have
been
very
pleasant
to
her
and
the
daughter
kindly
tells
me
i
am
pretty
if
you
are
both
schmidt
and
poor
though
i
speak
with
the
tongues
of
angels
and
have
no
family
it
avails
me
nothing
if
i
had
family
and
no
charity
i
would
get
on
much
better
in
the
world
in
defiance
of
paul
frau
von
lindeberg
would
take
me
to
her
heart
think
me
distinguished
where
now
she
thinks
me
odd
think
me
witty
where
now
she
thinks
me
bold
listen
to
my
speeches
laugh
at
my
sallies
be
interested
in
my
gardening
and
in
my
efforts
to
live
without
meat
but
here
i
am
burning
i
hope
with
charity
with
love
for
my
neighbors
with
ready
sympathy
eager
friendliness
desire
to
be
of
use
and
it
all
avails
me
nothing
because
my
name
is
schmidt
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
been
brought
into
daily
contact
with
our
nobility
in
jena
there
were
very
few
rare
bright
spots
here
and
there
on
the
sober
background
of
academic
little
stars
whose
shining
even
from
a
distance
made
us
blink
now
i
see
them
every
day
and
find
them
very
chilly
and
not
in
the
least
dazzling
i
no
longer
blink
perhaps
frau
von
lindeberg
feels
that
i
do
not
and
can
not
forgive
an
unblinking
schmidt
but
really
now
these
pretensions
are
very
absurd
the
free
blood
of
the
watsons
surges
within
me
at
the
sight
of
them
i
think
of
things
like
albion
daughters
and
britannia
ruling
waves
and
i
feel
somehow
that
it
is
a
proud
thing
to
be
partly
watson
and
to
have
had
progenitors
who
lived
in
a
house
called
the
acacias
in
a
street
called
plantagenet
road
which
is
what
the
watsons
did
what
claims
have
these
lindebergs
to
the
breathless
nay
sprawling
respect
they
apparently
demand
here
is
a
retired
colonel
who
was
an
officer
all
his
life
and
not
clever
enough
to
go
on
to
the
higher
military
positions
was
obliged
to
retire
at
fifty
he
belongs
to
a
good
family
and
married
some
one
of
slightly
better
birth
than
his
own
she
was
a
freiin
free
lady
von
dammerlitz
a
family
says
papa
large
unpleasant
and
mortgaged
it
has
given
germany
no
great
warriors
or
statesmen
its
sons
have
all
been
officers
who
did
not
turn
that
corner
round
which
the
higher
honors
lie
and
its
daughters
either
did
not
marry
at
all
being
portionless
or
married
impossible
persons
said
papa
such
as
as
i
inquired
expecting
to
hear
they
married
postmen
my
dear
said
papa
smiling
i
said
surprised
pastors
having
seemed
to
me
who
view
them
from
their
own
level
eminently
respectable
and
desirable
as
husbands
not
from
the
dammerlitz
point
of
view
my
dear
said
papa
said
i
trying
to
imagine
how
pastors
would
look
seen
from
that
well
here
are
these
people
freezing
us
into
what
they
consider
our
proper
place
whenever
we
come
across
them
taking
no
pains
to
hide
what
undesirable
beings
we
are
in
their
sight
staring
at
papa
hat
in
eloquent
silence
when
it
is
more
than
usually
tilted
over
one
ear
running
eyes
that
chill
my
blood
over
my
fustian
clothes
i
not
sure
what
fustian
is
but
i
quite
sure
my
clothes
are
made
of
it
oddly
deaf
when
we
say
anything
oddly
blind
when
we
meet
anywhere
unless
we
actually
run
into
them
here
they
are
doing
all
these
things
every
day
with
a
repeated
gusto
and
with
no
reason
whatever
that
i
can
see
to
support
their
pretensions
is
it
so
wonderful
to
be
a
for
that
is
all
look
as
i
will
that
i
can
see
they
have
to
go
on
they
are
poor
as
the
retired
officer
invariably
is
and
they
spend
much
time
pretending
they
are
not
they
know
nothing
he
has
spent
his
best
years
preoccupied
with
the
routine
of
his
calling
which
leaves
no
room
for
anything
approaching
study
or
interest
in
other
things
she
in
bringing
up
her
son
also
an
officer
and
in
taking
her
daughter
to
those
parties
in
berlin
that
so
closely
resemble
i
gather
from
the
girl
vicki
talk
the
parties
in
jena
a
little
wider
a
little
more
varied
with
more
cups
and
glasses
and
with
of
course
the
chance
we
do
not
have
in
jena
of
seeing
some
one
quite
new
but
on
the
whole
the
same
he
is
a
solemn
elderly
person
in
a
dressed
in
clothes
that
give
one
the
impression
of
always
being
black
he
vegetates
as
completely
as
any
one
i
have
ever
seen
or
dreamed
of
prolonged
coffee
in
the
morning
prolonged
and
a
turn
in
the
garden
kill
his
mornings
dinner
says
vicki
kills
another
hour
and
a
half
then
there
is
what
we
call
the
dinner
sleep
on
the
sofa
in
his
darkened
room
and
that
brings
him
to
coffee
time
they
sit
over
the
cups
till
vicki
wants
to
scream
at
least
she
wants
to
since
she
has
known
me
she
says
up
to
then
after
her
miserable
affair
she
sat
as
sluggishly
as
the
others
but
huddled
while
they
were
straight
and
which
they
were
not
after
coffee
the
parents
walk
up
the
road
to
a
certain
point
and
walk
back
again
then
comes
the
evening
paper
which
he
reads
till
and
after
supper
he
smokes
till
he
goes
to
bed
he
hardly
alive
at
all
i
said
to
vicki
when
she
described
this
existence
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
what
they
all
do
she
said
the
retired
i
seen
it
a
hundred
times
in
berlin
they
old
and
they
never
can
start
anything
fresh
wo
be
like
that
when
we
old
will
we
i
said
gazing
at
her
struck
as
by
a
vision
she
gazed
back
into
my
eyes
misgiving
creeping
into
hers
and
eat
and
read
the
paper
she
murmured
and
eat
and
read
the
paper
i
echoed
and
we
stared
at
each
other
in
silence
and
the
dim
years
seemed
to
catch
up
what
we
had
said
and
mournfully
droned
back
and
eat
and
read
the
paper
but
what
is
to
be
done
with
girls
of
good
family
who
do
not
marry
and
have
no
money
they
ca
go
governessing
and
indeed
it
is
a
dreary
trade
vicki
has
learned
nothing
except
a
little
cooking
and
other
domestic
drudgery
only
of
use
if
you
have
a
house
to
drudge
in
and
a
husband
to
drudge
for
of
those
pursuits
that
bring
in
money
and
make
you
independent
and
cause
you
to
flourish
and
keep
green
and
lusty
she
knows
nothing
if
i
had
a
daughter
i
would
bring
her
up
with
an
eye
fixed
entirely
on
a
husbandless
future
she
should
be
taught
some
trade
as
carefully
as
any
boy
her
head
should
be
filled
with
as
much
learning
as
it
would
conveniently
hold
side
by
side
with
a
proper
interest
in
ribbons
i
would
spend
my
days
impressing
her
with
the
gloriousness
of
independence
of
having
her
time
entirely
at
her
own
disposal
her
life
free
and
clear
the
world
open
before
her
as
open
as
it
was
to
adam
and
eve
when
they
turned
their
backs
once
and
for
all
on
the
cloying
sweetness
of
paradise
and
far
more
interesting
that
it
was
to
them
for
it
would
be
full
of
inhabitants
eager
to
give
her
the
hearty
welcome
always
awaiting
those
rare
persons
the
cheery
and
the
brave
sighed
vicki
when
with
great
eloquence
and
considerable
elaboration
i
unfolded
these
views
beautiful
papa
was
nearer
the
open
window
under
which
we
were
sitting
than
i
had
thought
for
he
suddenly
popped
out
his
head
is
a
merciful
thing
he
said
you
have
no
daughter
we
both
jumped
would
be
a
most
dreary
young
female
he
went
on
smiling
down
as
from
a
pulpit
on
our
heads
and
wiping
his
spectacles
continually
goaded
and
galvanized
by
a
parent
hammered
upon
chiselled
beaten
out
flat
me
papachen
i
murmured
out
flat
said
papa
waving
my
interruption
aside
with
his
spectacles
the
dead
weight
of
opinions
already
stale
the
victims
of
a
system
the
subjects
of
an
experiment
the
prisoners
of
prejudice
are
bound
either
to
flare
into
rank
rebellion
on
the
first
opportunity
or
to
grow
continually
drearier
and
more
conspicuously
stupid
vicki
stared
first
up
at
papa
then
at
me
her
soft
crumpled
sort
of
mouth
twisted
into
troubled
surprise
papa
leaned
further
out
and
hit
the
window
sill
with
his
hand
for
all
the
world
like
a
parson
hitting
his
pulpit
cushion
word
he
said
word
of
praise
or
blame
one
single
word
from
an
outsider
will
have
more
effect
upon
your
offspring
than
years
of
trouble
taken
by
yourself
mountains
of
doctrine
preached
by
you
rivers
of
good
advice
oceans
of
exhortations
cautions
as
numerous
as
abraham
posterity
well
known
to
have
been
as
numerous
as
the
sea
sand
private
prayers
and
public
admonition
and
he
disappeared
with
a
jerk
said
vicki
much
impressed
papa
popped
out
his
head
again
may
believe
me
he
said
do
papachen
said
i
have
to
thank
me
for
much
i
do
said
i
heartily
smiling
up
at
him
for
nothing
more
than
for
leaving
you
free
to
put
forth
such
shoots
as
your
nature
demanded
in
whatever
direction
your
instincts
propelled
you
and
he
disappeared
and
shut
the
window
vicki
looked
at
me
doubtfully
said
beautiful
things
she
said
he
said
just
the
opposite
which
is
true
said
i
promptly
determined
not
to
be
outdone
as
a
prophet
by
papa
poor
vicki
it
is
so
hard
to
have
life
turned
into
a
smudge
when
one
is
only
twenty
she
adored
this
man
was
so
proud
of
him
so
proud
of
herself
for
being
chosen
by
him
she
grew
in
the
year
during
which
they
were
engaged
into
a
woman
and
can
never
now
retrace
her
steps
back
to
that
fairy
place
of
sunshine
and
carelessness
in
which
we
so
happily
wander
if
we
are
left
alone
for
years
and
years
after
we
are
supposed
to
be
grown
up
do
you
realize
what
a
blow
in
the
face
she
has
received
as
well
as
in
her
unfortunate
little
heart
all
her
vanities
without
which
a
girl
is
but
a
poor
thing
shrivelled
up
her
gone
her
conceit
if
there
was
any
and
i
suppose
there
was
because
there
always
is
gone
headlong
after
it
a
betrothal
here
is
almost
as
binding
and
quite
as
solemn
as
a
marriage
it
is
announced
in
the
papers
it
is
abundantly
celebrated
and
the
parents
on
both
sides
fall
on
each
other
necks
and
think
highly
of
one
another
till
the
moment
comes
for
making
settlements
the
lindebergs
spent
all
they
had
laid
by
and
borrowed
more
to
buy
the
trousseau
and
furnish
the
house
vicki
cried
bitterly
when
she
talked
of
her
she
says
there
were
twelve
dozen
in
twelve
different
patterns
and
each
twelve
was
tied
up
with
a
pink
ribbon
fastened
by
a
buckle
and
a
bow
they
had
to
be
sold
again
at
a
grievous
loss
and
the
family
fled
from
berlin
and
the
faces
of
their
acquaintances
faces
crooked
with
the
effort
to
sympathize
when
what
they
really
wanted
to
do
says
vicki
was
to
smile
and
came
to
this
cheap
place
where
they
can
sit
in
obscurity
darning
up
the
holes
in
their
damaged
fortunes
frau
von
lindeberg
who
has
none
of
the
torment
of
rejected
love
to
occupy
her
feelings
and
all
the
bitterness
of
the
social
and
financial
blow
can
not
help
saying
hard
things
to
vicki
things
pointed
and
poisoned
with
reproaches
that
sometimes
almost
verge
on
taunts
the
man
was
a
good
for
vicki
little
money
but
much
promise
for
the
future
a
good
deal
older
than
herself
and
already
brilliant
as
an
officer
and
during
the
engagement
the
satisfied
mother
overflowed
as
mothers
will
with
love
for
the
creditable
daughter
was
so
nice
said
dolefully
sniffing
seemed
to
love
me
almost
as
much
as
she
loves
my
brother
i
was
so
happy
i
had
so
much
then
everything
went
at
once
mamma
ca
bear
to
think
that
no
one
will
ever
want
to
marry
me
now
because
i
have
been
engaged
well
love
is
a
cruel
horrible
thing
hardly
ever
do
both
the
persons
love
with
equal
enthusiasm
and
if
they
do
what
is
the
use
it
is
all
bound
to
end
in
smoke
and
nothingness
put
out
by
the
steady
drizzle
of
marriage
and
for
the
others
for
the
masses
of
people
who
do
not
love
equally
of
whom
one
half
is
at
a
miserable
disadvantage
at
the
mercy
absolutely
of
the
other
half
what
is
there
but
pain
in
the
end
and
yet
and
yet
it
is
a
pretty
thing
in
its
beginnings
a
sweet
darling
thing
but
like
a
kitten
all
charm
and
delicious
ways
at
first
innocent
soft
enchanting
it
turns
into
a
cat
with
appalling
rapidity
and
cruelly
claws
you
i
like
to
know
if
there
a
single
being
on
earth
so
happy
and
so
indifferent
that
he
has
not
got
hidden
away
beneath
a
brave
show
of
clothes
and
trimmings
the
mark
of
love
claws
and
i
think
most
of
the
clawings
are
so
ferocious
that
they
are
for
a
long
time
ghastly
tears
that
open
and
bleed
again
and
when
with
years
they
slowly
dry
up
there
is
always
the
scar
red
and
terrible
that
makes
you
wince
if
by
any
chance
it
is
touched
that
is
what
i
think
what
do
you
think
no
do
tell
me
what
you
think
i
do
want
to
know
xlvi
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
yesterday
i
was
so
much
absorbed
by
vicki
woes
that
i
never
got
to
what
i
really
wanted
to
write
about
it
that
book
i
found
in
the
jena
bookshop
it
was
and
cheap
and
i
bought
it
and
it
has
unkindly
revenged
itself
by
playing
havoc
with
my
illusions
it
is
a
collection
of
descriptions
of
what
is
known
of
the
lives
of
the
english
poets
beginning
with
chaucer
who
is
luckily
too
far
away
to
provide
much
tattle
and
coming
down
the
centuries
growing
bigger
with
gossip
as
it
comes
till
it
ends
with
rossetti
and
fitzgerald
and
stevenson
each
poet
has
his
portrait
it
was
for
that
i
bought
it
i
can
not
tell
you
how
eagerly
i
looked
at
them
at
last
i
was
going
to
see
what
wordsworth
looked
like
and
coleridge
and
keats
and
shelley
one
of
my
dreams
has
been
to
go
to
that
national
portrait
gallery
of
yours
in
london
described
in
an
old
baedeker
i
once
saw
and
gaze
at
the
faces
of
those
whose
spirits
i
know
so
well
now
i
want
to
can
you
imagine
what
it
is
like
what
an
extremely
blessed
state
it
is
only
to
have
read
the
works
of
a
poet
the
best
of
him
and
to
have
lived
so
far
from
his
country
and
from
biographies
or
collections
of
his
letters
that
all
gossip
about
his
private
life
and
criticisms
of
his
morals
are
unknown
to
you
milton
wordsworth
keats
shelley
burns
have
been
to
me
great
teachers
great
examples
before
whose
shining
image
built
up
out
of
the
radiant
materials
their
works
provided
i
have
spent
glorious
hours
in
worship
not
a
cloud
not
a
misgiving
has
dimmed
my
worship
we
need
altars
anyhow
we
women
do
and
they
were
mine
i
have
not
been
able
to
be
religious
in
the
ordinary
sense
and
they
have
taken
the
place
of
religion
our
own
best
poets
goethe
schiller
heine
and
the
rest
do
not
appeal
to
me
in
the
same
way
goethe
is
wonderful
but
he
leaves
you
sitting
somehow
in
a
cold
place
from
which
you
call
out
at
intervals
with
conviction
that
he
is
immense
the
while
you
wish
he
would
keep
the
feet
of
your
soul
a
little
warmer
schiller
beats
his
patriotic
drum
his
fine
eyes
rolling
continually
toward
the
gallery
too
unintermittently
for
perfect
delight
heine
the
exquisite
the
cunning
worker
in
gems
the
stringer
of
pearls
on
frailest
golden
threads
is
too
mischievous
too
malicious
to
be
set
up
in
a
temple
and
then
you
ca
help
laughing
at
his
extraordinary
gift
for
maddening
the
respectable
at
the
extraordinary
skill
and
neatness
with
which
he
deposits
poison
in
their
tenderest
places
and
how
can
he
worship
who
is
being
made
to
laugh
if
i
knew
little
about
our
poets
lives
inevitably
i
know
more
than
i
want
to
i
still
would
feel
the
same
there
is
i
think
in
their
poetry
nothing
heavenly
it
is
true
i
bless
god
for
them
thank
him
for
having
let
them
live
and
sing
for
having
given
us
such
a
noble
heritage
but
i
ca
go
all
the
way
papa
goes
and
melt
in
a
bath
of
rapture
whenever
goethe
name
is
mentioned
i
remember
what
you
said
about
goethe
it
has
not
influenced
me
i
do
think
you
were
wrong
but
i
do
too
think
that
everything
really
heavenly
in
our
nation
everything
purely
inspired
manifestly
immortal
has
gone
not
into
our
poetry
but
into
our
music
that
has
absorbed
our
whole
share
of
divine
fire
and
left
our
poets
nothing
but
the
cool
and
conscious
exercise
of
their
intellects
well
i
am
preaching
i
would
make
a
very
arrogant
parson
would
i
laying
down
the
law
more
often
than
the
prophets
from
that
safe
citadel
a
pulpit
but
please
have
patience
for
i
want
you
to
comfort
me
the
book
really
has
made
me
unhappy
it
is
the
kind
of
book
you
must
go
on
reading
angry
rebelling
at
every
page
but
never
leaving
it
till
you
reached
the
last
word
then
you
throw
it
as
hard
as
you
can
into
the
furthest
corner
of
the
room
and
shake
yourself
as
a
dog
does
come
up
out
of
muddy
water
and
think
to
shake
it
off
as
easily
as
he
does
his
mud
but
you
ca
because
it
has
burned
itself
into
your
soul
i
do
suppose
you
will
understand
what
i
feel
when
a
person
possesses
very
few
things
those
few
things
are
terribly
precious
see
the
mother
of
the
only
child
and
compare
her
conduct
when
it
coughs
with
the
conduct
of
the
mother
of
six
all
coughing
see
how
one
agonizes
and
see
with
what
serenity
the
other
brings
out
her
bottle
of
mixture
and
pours
it
calmly
down
her
children
throats
well
i
like
the
first
mother
and
you
are
like
the
second
i
expect
you
knew
long
ago
and
have
never
minded
knowing
the
littlenesses
of
my
gods
but
i
i
felt
as
unsettled
while
i
read
about
them
as
uneasy
as
fidgety
as
frightened
as
a
horse
being
driven
by
somebody
cruel
which
knows
that
every
minute
the
lash
will
come
down
in
some
fresh
place
think
i
knew
nothing
about
harriet
westbrook
and
her
tragic
life
and
death
i
had
never
heard
of
emilia
viviani
of
mary
of
her
whose
name
was
eliza
but
who
soared
aloft
in
the
sunshine
of
shelley
admiration
portia
only
presently
to
descend
once
more
into
the
font
and
come
out
luridly
as
the
brown
demon
i
never
knew
that
keats
loved
somebody
called
brawne
and
that
she
was
unwilling
that
she
saw
little
in
him
in
endymion
the
godlike
the
divinely
gifted
and
that
he
was
so
persistent
so
unworthily
persistent
that
the
only
word
i
can
find
that
at
all
describes
it
is
the
german
i
had
never
heard
of
jean
armour
of
the
headlong
descent
from
being
who
walked
in
glory
and
in
joy
following
his
plough
along
the
to
hopeless
black
years
spent
in
at
the
beck
and
call
think
of
it
think
of
the
divine
spirit
forced
to
it
by
its
body
of
any
one
who
would
pay
for
a
drink
i
never
knew
about
coleridge
opium
or
that
to
carlyle
he
appeared
as
a
helpless
psyche
overspun
with
church
of
england
cobwebs
as
a
weak
diffusive
weltering
ineffectual
man
i
never
knew
that
wordsworth
greeting
was
a
languid
handful
of
numb
unresponsive
fingers
that
his
speech
was
prolix
thin
endlessly
diluted
i
never
knew
that
milton
had
three
wives
that
the
first
one
ran
away
from
him
a
month
after
their
marriage
that
he
was
hard
to
his
daughters
so
hard
that
they
wished
him
dead
all
these
things
i
never
knew
and
for
years
i
have
been
walking
with
glorious
spirits
and
have
been
fed
on
and
drunk
the
milk
of
paradise
when
first
i
saw
portrait
i
turned
cold
do
laugh
i
did
actually
turn
cold
he
had
been
so
much
in
my
life
i
had
pictured
him
so
wonderful
calm
beautiful
with
the
loftiest
kind
of
beauty
faintly
frosty
at
times
and
detached
yet
gently
cheery
and
always
dignified
it
is
the
picture
from
a
portrait
by
some
one
called
hancock
very
bitterly
do
i
dislike
hancock
it
is
a
profile
it
would
if
i
had
seen
it
in
the
flesh
completely
have
hidden
from
my
silly
short
sight
the
inner
splendors
i
afraid
oh
i
afraid
and
i
shiver
with
shame
to
think
it
that
i
would
have
regarded
him
only
as
an
elderly
gentleman
of
irreproachable
character
out
of
whose
way
it
was
as
well
to
get
because
he
showed
every
sign
of
being
a
bore
will
you
think
me
irretrievably
silly
when
i
tell
you
that
i
cried
over
that
picture
for
one
dreadful
moment
i
stared
at
it
in
startled
horror
then
i
banged
the
book
to
and
fled
up
into
the
forest
to
cry
there
was
a
smugness
but
no
i
wo
think
of
it
upset
all
my
theories
about
the
face
being
the
mirror
of
the
soul
it
ca
be
if
it
is
peter
bell
and
the
thorn
are
accounted
for
but
who
shall
account
for
the
bleak
nobility
the
communings
with
nature
on
lofty
heights
in
the
light
of
setting
suns
or
when
he
comes
down
nearer
for
that
bright
world
he
unlocks
of
things
dear
to
memory
of
home
of
childhood
of
quiet
places
of
calm
affections
and
for
the
tenderness
with
which
it
is
done
and
for
its
beautiful
simple
goodness
coleridge
picture
was
another
disillusionment
but
not
so
great
a
shock
because
i
have
loved
him
less
he
was
so
rarely
inspired
i
think
you
need
more
than
the
fingers
of
one
hand
for
the
doing
of
sums
with
coleridge
inspirations
still
it
saddened
me
to
be
told
he
was
a
helpless
psyche
i
did
like
to
hear
about
his
cobwebs
i
hated
being
forced
to
know
of
his
weakness
of
his
wasted
life
growing
steadily
dingier
the
farther
he
travelled
from
that
east
that
had
seen
him
set
out
so
bright
with
morning
radiance
really
the
world
would
be
a
peaceful
place
if
we
could
only
keep
quiet
about
each
other
weak
points
why
are
we
so
restless
till
we
have
pulled
down
belittled
besmudged
you
say
that
without
a
little
malice
talk
would
grow
very
dull
you
tell
me
it
is
the
salt
the
froth
the
sparkle
the
ginger
in
the
the
mustard
in
the
sandwich
but
you
must
admit
that
it
becomes
only
terrible
when
it
ca
leave
the
few
truly
great
spirits
alone
when
it
must
somehow
drag
them
down
to
our
lower
level
pointing
out
in
writing
so
that
posterity
too
shall
have
no
illusions
the
spots
on
the
sun
the
weak
places
in
the
armor
and
pushing
us
who
want
to
be
left
alone
praying
in
the
of
the
temple
down
the
area
steps
into
the
kitchen
two
nights
and
two
days
have
i
spent
feverishly
with
that
book
i
dare
not
hope
that
i
shall
forget
it
i
have
never
yet
forgotten
undesirable
bad
things
now
when
i
take
my
poets
up
with
me
into
the
forest
and
sit
on
one
of
those
dusky
slopes
where
the
light
is
subdued
to
a
mysterious
and
the
world
is
quieted
into
a
listening
silence
and
far
away
below
the
roofs
of
jena
glisten
in
the
sun
and
the
white
butterflies
like
white
flowers
come
to
life
flutter
after
each
other
across
the
blue
curtain
of
heat
that
hangs
beyond
the
trees
now
when
i
open
them
and
begin
to
read
the
noble
familiar
words
will
not
those
other
words
those
anecdotes
those
personal
descriptions
those
suggestions
those
leer
at
me
between
the
lines
shall
i
straining
my
ears
after
the
music
not
be
shown
now
for
ever
only
the
instrument
and
how
pitifully
the
ivory
has
come
off
the
keys
shall
i
hungering
after
my
spiritual
food
not
have
pushed
upon
my
notice
so
that
i
am
forced
to
look
the
saucepan
tarnished
and
not
quite
clean
in
which
it
was
cooked
please
do
tell
me
you
ca
understand
try
to
imagine
yourself
in
my
place
come
out
of
that
gay
world
of
yours
where
you
are
talking
or
being
talked
to
all
day
long
and
suppose
yourself
schmidt
alone
in
jena
on
a
hill
with
books
suppose
yourself
for
hours
and
hours
every
day
of
your
life
with
nothing
particular
that
you
must
do
that
you
have
no
shooting
no
hunting
no
newspapers
no
novels
suppose
you
are
passionately
fond
of
reading
and
that
of
all
reading
you
most
love
poetry
suppose
you
have
inherited
from
a
mother
who
loved
them
as
much
as
you
do
a
precious
of
the
poets
cheap
editions
entirely
free
from
the
blight
of
commentaries
and
introductory
biographies
and
suppose
these
books
in
the
course
of
years
have
become
your
religion
your
guide
the
source
of
your
best
thoughts
and
happiest
moments
would
you
look
on
placidly
while
some
one
scrawled
malicious
truths
between
their
lines
oh
you
would
not
you
would
feel
as
i
do
think
what
the
writers
are
to
me
how
i
have
built
up
their
personalities
entirely
out
of
the
materials
they
gave
me
in
their
work
they
never
told
me
horrid
things
about
themselves
their
spirits
which
alone
they
talked
about
were
serene
and
white
i
knew
milton
was
blind
because
he
chose
beautifully
to
tell
me
so
i
knew
he
must
have
been
an
appreciative
and
regretful
husband
because
no
husband
who
did
not
appreciate
and
regret
would
go
so
far
as
to
talk
of
his
deceased
wife
as
his
late
espoused
saint
i
knew
he
was
a
tender
friend
a
friend
capable
of
deepest
love
and
sorrow
for
in
spite
of
johnson
is
not
to
be
considered
as
the
effusion
of
real
passion
i
was
convinced
by
the
love
and
sorrow
of
i
knew
he
was
a
man
whose
spirit
was
dissolved
continually
into
the
highest
ecstasies
who
lived
with
all
heaven
before
his
eyes
briefly
i
said
amen
to
wordsworth
soul
was
like
a
star
and
dwelt
apart
and
now
a
series
of
sordid
little
pictures
rises
up
before
me
and
chokes
my
amen
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
him
having
two
or
three
olives
for
supper
and
a
little
cold
water
and
then
being
cross
to
his
daughters
of
course
he
must
be
cross
on
such
a
supper
i
ca
conceive
it
kind
to
drill
the
daughters
so
strictly
in
languages
they
did
not
understand
that
they
could
read
them
aloud
to
him
with
extraordinary
correctness
i
shrink
from
the
thought
of
the
grumbling
there
was
in
that
house
of
heavenly
visions
grumbling
and
squabbling
stamped
out
it
is
true
by
the
heavy
parental
foot
wherever
noticed
but
smouldering
on
from
one
occasion
to
the
other
i
can
not
believe
i
wish
i
could
that
a
child
will
dislike
a
parent
without
cause
the
cause
may
be
small
things
a
series
of
trifles
each
of
little
moment
snubs
too
often
repeated
chills
too
often
applied
stern
looks
short
words
sarcasms
and
these
as
you
and
i
both
know
are
quite
ordinary
dulnesses
often
daily
ingredients
of
family
life
but
they
sit
with
a
strange
and
upsetting
grace
on
the
poet
of
paradise
and
i
would
give
anything
never
to
have
heard
of
them
and
then
you
know
i
loved
fitzgerald
he
had
one
of
my
best
altars
you
remember
you
read
twice
aloud
to
me
once
in
the
spring
it
was
the
third
of
april
a
sudden
hot
day
blue
and
joyous
slipped
in
to
show
god
had
not
forgotten
us
between
weeks
of
hopeless
skies
and
icy
winds
and
once
last
september
that
afternoon
we
drifted
down
the
river
past
the
town
away
from
houses
and
people
and
work
and
lessons
out
to
where
the
partridges
scuttled
across
the
stubble
and
all
the
world
was
golden
that
was
the
eleventh
of
september
i
am
rather
good
you
see
at
dates
well
now
i
call
him
fitz
and
laugh
at
the
description
of
him
going
about
suffolk
lanes
in
a
battered
tall
hat
tied
on
in
windy
weather
by
a
handkerchief
and
trailing
behind
him
instead
of
clouds
of
glory
a
shawl
of
green
and
black
plaid
it
is
of
course
in
any
way
a
bad
thing
to
trail
shawls
after
you
on
country
walks
there
is
nothing
about
it
or
him
that
shocks
or
grieves
he
is
very
lovable
but
i
do
want
to
laugh
i
do
want
to
call
him
fitz
he
is
one
of
the
gods
in
my
temple
a
place
from
which
i
rigorously
exclude
the
sense
of
humor
i
do
like
gods
who
are
amusing
i
can
not
worship
and
laugh
simultaneously
i
know
that
laughter
is
good
and
i
know
that
even
derision
in
small
quantities
is
as
wholesome
as
salt
but
i
like
to
laugh
and
deride
outside
holy
places
and
not
be
forced
to
do
it
while
i
am
on
my
knees
now
do
say
what
on
earth
does
the
woman
want
because
it
seems
to
me
so
plain
what
the
woman
wants
is
that
present
and
future
poets
should
wrap
themselves
sternly
in
an
impenetrable
veil
of
anonymity
they
wo
but
she
can
go
on
praying
that
they
will
they
wo
because
of
the
power
of
the
passing
moment
because
of
the
pleasantness
of
praise
of
recognition
of
personal
influence
and
i
suppose
but
i
not
sure
of
money
do
you
remember
that
merry
rhymer
prior
how
he
sang
is
long
ago
since
gods
came
down
incognito
well
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
they
had
gone
on
doing
it
a
little
longer
he
was
i
think
deploring
what
i
deplore
the
absence
of
a
sense
for
the
anonymous
in
gods
of
a
sense
of
the
dignity
of
separation
of
retirement
of
mystery
wherever
there
is
even
one
spark
of
the
divine
i
think
he
thought
they
had
all
been
and
that
neither
incognito
nor
in
any
other
form
would
they
appear
again
he
implied
and
so
joined
himself
across
the
centuries
to
the
walrus
and
the
carpenter
that
there
were
no
gods
to
come
well
he
has
been
dead
over
a
hundred
and
eighty
years
and
they
have
simply
flocked
since
then
i
like
to
write
the
great
names
on
this
page
the
names
of
the
poets
first
and
greatest
of
the
gods
to
raise
it
to
dignity
and
confound
the
ghost
of
prior
but
i
wo
out
of
consideration
for
you
does
not
my
enthusiasm
my
mountain
energy
make
you
groan
with
the
deadly
fatigue
of
him
who
has
to
listen
and
can
not
share
i
leave
off
my
letter
is
growing
unbecomingly
fat
the
air
up
here
is
so
bracing
that
my
very
unhappinesses
seem
after
all
full
of
zest
very
vocal
healthy
griefs
really
almost
enjoying
themselves
i
go
back
to
my
pots
i
busy
today
though
you
might
think
it
making
apple
jelly
out
of
our
very
own
apples
i
go
back
to
my
pots
and
forget
no
i
wo
make
a
feeble
joke
i
was
just
going
to
make
because
of
what
i
know
your
face
would
look
like
when
you
read
it
after
all
i
believe
i
more
than
a
little
bit
frightened
of
you
yours
sincerely
schmidt
xlvii
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
how
nice
of
you
to
be
so
kind
to
write
so
consolingly
to
be
so
patient
in
explaining
where
i
am
thinking
wrong
i
burned
the
book
in
the
kitchen
fire
and
felt
great
satisfaction
in
clearing
the
house
of
its
presence
you
are
right
i
have
no
concern
with
the
body
of
a
poet
all
my
concern
is
with
his
soul
and
the
two
shall
be
severely
separated
i
am
glad
you
agree
with
me
that
poets
should
be
anonymous
but
you
seem
to
have
even
less
hope
that
they
ever
will
be
than
i
have
at
least
i
pray
that
they
may
you
apparently
take
no
steps
whatever
to
bring
it
about
you
say
that
experience
teaches
that
we
must
not
expect
too
much
of
gods
that
the
possible
pangs
of
posterity
often
leave
them
cold
that
they
are
blind
to
the
merits
of
bushels
and
discern
neither
honor
nor
profit
in
the
use
of
those
vessels
of
extinguishment
you
fear
that
they
will
not
change
and
you
exhort
me
to
see
to
it
that
their
weakness
shall
not
be
an
occasion
for
my
stumbling
that
is
very
sensible
advice
but
before
your
kind
letter
came
a
few
fresh
autumn
mornings
had
cleared
a
good
deal
of
my
first
dejection
away
if
the
gods
wo
hide
themselves
i
can
after
all
shut
my
eyes
if
i
may
not
rejoice
in
the
divine
in
them
with
undistracted
attention
i
will
try
at
least
to
get
all
the
warmth
i
can
from
its
burning
and
i
can
imitate
my
own
dainty
and
diligent
bees
and
take
care
to
be
absorbed
only
in
their
honey
you
make
me
ashamed
of
my
folly
in
thinking
i
could
never
read
burns
again
now
that
i
know
about
his
sins
i
did
secretly
think
so
i
was
sure
of
it
i
felt
quite
sick
to
see
him
tumbled
from
his
altar
into
the
mud
your
letter
shows
me
that
once
again
i
have
been
foolish
why
it
has
verged
on
idiocy
i
myself
have
laughed
at
people
in
jena
strictly
pious
people
who
will
not
read
goethe
who
have
a
personally
vindictive
feeling
against
him
because
of
his
different
and
i
have
listened
astonished
to
the
fury
with
which
the
proposal
of
a
few
persons
to
give
heine
a
statue
was
opposed
and
to
the
tone
almost
of
hatred
with
which
one
man
whenever
his
name
is
mentioned
calls
out
about
our
poets
i
have
been
from
the
beginning
quite
sane
but
yours
were
somehow
more
sacred
to
me
sacred
i
suppose
because
they
were
more
mysterious
more
distant
glorious
through
which
god
sent
his
messages
i
was
so
glad
i
whose
tendency
is
i
am
afraid
to
laugh
and
criticise
to
possess
one
thing
at
which
i
could
not
laugh
to
have
a
whole
tract
of
beauty
in
which
i
could
walk
seriously
with
downcast
eyes
and
i
thought
i
was
never
going
to
be
able
to
be
serious
there
again
it
was
a
passing
fit
a
violent
revulsion
if
i
like
carefully
to
separate
my
own
soul
and
body
why
should
i
not
do
the
same
with
those
of
other
sinners
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
so
quaint
the
way
we
admit
the
good
nature
with
which
we
reiterate
that
we
are
all
wretched
sinners
we
do
it
with
such
an
immense
complacency
we
agree
so
heartily
with
such
comfortable
regretful
sighs
when
anybody
tells
us
so
but
with
only
one
wretched
sinner
are
we
of
a
real
patience
with
him
indeed
our
patience
is
boundless
i
know
this
i
have
always
known
it
and
i
will
not
now
at
an
age
when
it
is
my
hope
to
grow
every
year
a
little
better
forget
it
and
be
as
insolently
intolerant
as
the
man
who
shudders
at
the
name
of
heine
will
not
read
a
line
of
him
and
calls
him
that
writer
books
you
tell
me
about
the
books
the
virtuous
in
england
will
not
read
because
his
private
life
was
disgraceful
beautiful
books
you
say
into
which
went
his
best
in
which
his
spirit
showed
how
bright
it
was
how
he
had
kept
it
apart
and
clean
i
shall
get
them
all
and
read
them
all
no
sinner
cursed
with
a
body
at
variance
with
his
soul
and
able
in
spite
of
it
to
hear
the
music
of
heaven
and
give
it
exquisite
expression
shall
ever
again
be
identified
by
me
with
what
at
such
great
pains
he
has
kept
white
i
know
at
least
three
german
writers
to
whom
the
same
thing
happened
men
who
live
badly
and
write
nobly
my
heart
goes
out
to
them
i
think
of
them
lame
and
handicapped
leading
their
muse
by
the
hand
with
anxious
care
so
that
her
shining
feet
set
among
the
grass
and
daisies
along
the
roadside
shall
not
be
dimmed
by
the
foulness
through
which
they
themselves
are
splashing
they
are
caked
with
impurities
but
with
the
tenderest
watchfulness
they
keep
her
clean
she
is
their
gift
to
the
world
the
gift
of
their
best
of
their
angel
of
their
share
of
divinity
and
the
respectable
afraid
for
their
respectability
turn
their
backs
in
horror
and
go
and
read
without
blinking
ugly
things
written
by
other
respectables
why
no
priest
at
the
altar
however
unworthy
can
hinder
the
worshipper
from
taking
away
with
him
as
great
a
load
of
blessings
as
he
will
carry
and
a
rose
is
not
less
lovely
because
its
roots
are
in
corruption
and
god
himself
was
found
once
in
a
manger
thank
you
and
schmidt
xlviii
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
we
are
very
happy
here
just
now
because
papa
new
book
at
which
he
has
been
working
two
years
is
finished
i
am
copying
it
out
and
until
that
is
done
we
shall
indulge
in
the
pleasantest
it
is
our
time
this
interval
between
the
finishing
of
a
book
of
his
and
its
offer
to
a
publisher
for
being
riotously
happy
we
build
the
most
outrageous
castles
in
the
air
nothing
is
certain
and
everything
is
possible
the
pains
of
composition
are
over
and
the
pains
of
rejection
are
not
begun
each
time
we
suppose
they
never
will
and
that
at
last
ears
will
be
found
respectfully
ready
to
absorb
his
views
few
and
far
between
have
the
ears
been
till
now
his
books
have
fallen
as
flat
as
books
can
fall
nobody
wanted
to
hear
all
or
even
half
that
he
could
tell
them
about
goethe
jena
shrugged
its
shoulders
the
larger
world
was
blank
the
books
have
brought
us
no
fame
no
money
some
tragic
hours
but
much
interest
and
amusement
always
tragic
hours
have
come
when
papa
clutched
at
his
hair
and
raved
rude
things
about
the
german
public
and
when
the
money
did
appear
there
have
been
uncomfortable
moments
but
these
pass
papa
leaves
his
hair
alone
and
the
balance
remains
on
the
side
of
nice
things
we
do
really
want
any
more
money
and
papa
is
kept
busy
and
happy
and
just
to
see
him
so
eager
so
full
of
his
work
seems
to
warm
the
house
with
pleasant
sunshine
once
for
one
book
a
check
did
come
and
when
we
all
rushed
to
look
we
found
it
was
for
two
marks
and
thirty
pfennings
being
the
amount
due
said
the
accompanying
stony
letter
royalties
for
the
first
year
of
publication
papa
thought
this
much
worse
than
no
check
at
all
and
took
it
round
to
the
publisher
in
the
molten
frame
of
mind
of
one
who
has
been
insulted
the
publisher
put
his
thumbs
in
the
armholes
of
his
waistcoat
leaned
back
in
his
chair
gazed
with
refreshing
coolness
at
papa
who
was
very
hot
and
said
that
as
trade
went
it
was
quite
a
good
check
and
that
he
had
sent
one
that
very
morning
to
another
author
a
jena
celebrity
who
employs
his
leisure
writing
books
about
the
universe
for
ninety
pfennings
papa
came
home
beaming
with
the
delicious
feeling
that
money
was
flowing
in
and
that
he
was
having
a
boom
the
universe
man
was
a
contemptuous
acquaintance
who
had
been
heard
to
speak
lightly
of
papa
books
papa
felt
all
the
sweetness
of
success
of
triumph
over
a
disagreeable
rival
and
since
then
we
have
looked
upon
that
special
book
as
his
while
i
copy
he
comes
in
and
out
to
ask
me
where
i
have
got
to
and
if
i
like
it
i
assure
him
that
i
think
it
delightful
and
so
honestly
i
do
in
a
way
but
i
do
think
it
will
be
the
public
way
it
begins
by
telling
the
reader
presumably
a
person
in
search
of
information
about
goethe
that
jena
is
a
town
of
twenty
thousand
inhabitants
of
whom
nineteen
thousand
are
apparently
professors
the
town
certainly
does
give
you
that
impression
as
you
walk
about
its
little
streets
and
at
every
corner
meet
the
same
persons
in
black
you
met
at
the
corner
before
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
goethe
and
the
pages
that
follow
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
either
that
i
can
see
being
a
disquisition
on
the
origin
and
evolution
of
the
felt
hats
the
professors
wear
dingy
slouchy
things
winding
up
with
an
explanation
of
their
symbolism
and
inevitableness
based
on
a
carefully
drawn
parallel
between
them
and
the
kind
of
brains
they
have
to
cover
from
this
point
the
point
of
the
of
the
learned
in
our
present
year
he
has
to
work
back
all
the
way
to
goethe
in
jena
a
century
ago
it
takes
him
several
chapters
to
get
back
for
he
does
go
straight
being
constitutionally
unable
to
resist
turning
aside
down
the
green
lanes
of
moralizing
that
branch
so
seductively
off
the
main
road
and
lead
him
at
last
very
far
afield
and
when
he
does
arrive
he
is
rather
breathless
and
flutters
for
some
time
round
the
impassive
giant
waiting
to
be
described
jerking
out
little
anecdotes
very
pleasant
little
anecdotes
but
quite
unconnected
with
his
patient
subject
before
he
has
got
his
wind
and
can
begin
he
is
rosy
with
hope
about
this
book
jena
will
read
it
he
says
they
will
like
to
hear
about
themselves
i
wonder
if
they
will
all
germany
will
read
it
because
it
will
like
to
hear
about
goethe
has
heard
a
good
deal
about
him
already
you
know
papachen
i
say
trying
gently
to
suggest
certain
possibilities
might
like
to
have
it
there
has
been
nothing
since
that
man
lewes
and
never
anything
really
thorough
a
good
translation
what
do
you
think
of
that
as
an
agreeable
task
for
you
during
the
approaching
winter
evenings
it
is
a
matter
worthy
of
consideration
you
will
like
a
share
in
the
work
a
finger
in
the
literary
pie
will
you
not
course
i
would
but
let
me
copy
now
darling
i
not
half
through
he
says
that
if
those
blind
and
prejudiced
persons
publishers
risk
bringing
it
out
he
bring
it
out
at
his
own
expense
sooner
than
prevent
the
world
rightly
knowing
what
goethe
said
and
did
in
jena
so
there
a
serious
eventuality
ahead
of
us
we
really
will
have
to
live
on
lettuces
and
in
grimmest
earnest
this
time
i
hope
he
wo
want
to
keep
next
well
one
thing
has
happened
that
will
go
a
little
way
toward
meeting
new
expenses
i
go
down
every
day
now
and
read
english
with
vicki
at
the
desire
of
her
mother
for
two
hours
her
mother
having
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
better
to
legalize
as
it
were
my
relations
with
vicki
who
flatly
refused
to
keep
away
from
us
so
i
am
a
and
can
do
something
to
help
papa
it
is
true
i
ca
help
much
for
what
i
earn
is
fifty
pfennings
each
time
and
as
the
reading
of
english
on
sundays
is
not
considered
nice
i
can
only
altogether
make
three
marks
a
week
but
it
is
something
and
it
is
easily
earned
and
last
sunday
which
was
the
end
of
my
first
week
i
bought
the
whole
of
the
sunday
food
with
it
dinner
and
supper
for
us
and
beer
for
johanna
lover
who
says
he
can
not
love
her
unless
the
beer
is
a
particular
sort
and
has
been
kept
for
a
fortnight
properly
cold
in
the
since
i
have
read
with
vicki
frau
von
lindeberg
is
quite
different
she
is
courteous
with
the
careful
courtesy
decent
people
show
their
dependents
kindly
even
gracious
at
times
she
is
present
at
the
reading
darning
socks
and
ancient
sheets
with
her
carefully
kept
fingers
and
she
treats
me
absolutely
as
though
i
were
attached
to
her
household
as
governess
she
is
no
longer
afraid
we
will
want
to
be
equals
she
asks
me
quite
often
after
the
health
of
him
she
calls
my
good
father
and
when
a
cousin
of
hers
came
last
week
to
stay
a
night
a
female
dammerlitz
on
her
way
to
a
place
where
you
drink
waters
and
get
rid
of
yourself
she
presented
me
to
her
with
pleasant
condescension
as
the
engaged
as
her
daughter
companion
recht
hebe
hausgenossin
she
was
pleased
to
add
gently
nodding
her
head
at
each
word
and
the
cousin
went
away
convinced
i
was
a
resident
official
and
that
the
tales
she
had
heard
about
the
lindeberg
poverty
could
be
true
not
scriptural
i
complained
to
vicki
stirred
to
honest
indignation
mean
to
say
things
not
quite
not
quite
said
vicki
big
ones
i
fumed
not
little
i
not
english
i
not
a
why
such
unnecessary
ones
you
do
know
why
mamma
said
little
a
term
of
condescension
are
rather
grand
things
to
have
in
the
house
you
know
expensive
i
mean
always
dearer
than
natives
mamma
only
wants
cousin
mienchen
to
suppose
we
are
well
off
said
i
do
mind
said
vicki
rather
timidly
taking
my
hand
does
hurt
me
said
i
putting
a
little
stress
on
the
me
a
stress
implying
infinite
possible
hurt
to
frau
von
lindeberg
soul
is
horrid
murmured
vicki
her
head
drooping
over
her
book
wish
we
did
always
pretend
we
not
poor
we
are
poor
as
mice
and
it
makes
us
so
sensitive
about
it
so
afraid
of
anything
being
noticed
we
spend
our
lives
on
tenterhooks
not
nice
things
at
all
to
spend
life
on
uncomfortable
things
i
agreed
believe
cousin
mienchen
is
in
the
least
taken
in
for
all
our
pains
do
believe
people
ever
are
said
i
and
we
drifted
into
a
consideration
of
the
probable
height
of
our
temperatures
and
color
of
our
ears
if
we
could
know
how
much
the
world
we
pose
to
really
knows
about
us
if
we
could
hear
with
what
thoroughness
those
of
our
doings
and
even
of
our
thoughts
that
we
believed
so
secret
are
discussed
frau
von
lindeberg
was
there
being
too
busy
arranging
comforts
for
her
cousin
journey
to
preside
and
so
it
was
that
we
drifted
unhindered
from
milton
into
the
foggier
regions
of
private
wisdom
we
are
neither
of
us
wise
but
it
is
surprising
how
talking
to
a
friend
even
to
a
friend
as
unwise
as
yourself
clears
up
your
brains
and
lets
in
new
light
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
like
writing
to
you
and
getting
your
letters
only
you
must
be
offended
at
my
bracketing
you
you
splendid
young
man
with
poor
vicki
and
poor
myself
in
the
class
unwise
heaven
knows
i
mean
nothing
to
do
with
in
which
i
am
aware
you
most
beautifully
excel
yours
sincerely
schmidt
xlix
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
i
am
very
sorry
indeed
to
hear
that
your
engagement
is
broken
off
i
feared
something
of
the
sort
was
going
to
happen
because
of
all
the
things
you
nearly
said
and
did
in
your
letters
lately
are
you
very
much
troubled
and
worried
please
let
me
turn
into
the
elder
sister
for
a
little
again
and
give
you
the
small
relief
of
having
an
attentive
listener
it
seems
to
have
been
rather
an
unsatisfactory
time
for
you
all
along
i
do
really
quite
know
what
to
say
i
am
anyhow
most
sincerely
sorry
but
i
find
it
extraordinarily
difficult
to
talk
about
miss
cheriton
it
is
of
course
lamentable
that
our
writing
to
each
other
should
have
been
as
you
say
it
was
so
often
the
cause
of
quarrels
you
never
told
me
so
or
i
would
at
once
have
stopped
you
fill
several
pages
with
surprise
that
a
girl
of
can
be
so
different
from
what
she
appears
that
so
soft
and
tender
an
outside
can
have
beneath
it
such
unfathomable
depths
of
hardness
i
think
you
have
probably
gone
to
the
other
extreme
now
and
because
you
admired
so
much
are
all
the
more
violently
critical
it
is
probable
that
miss
cheriton
is
all
that
you
first
thought
her
unusually
charming
and
sympathetic
and
lovable
and
your
characters
simply
did
suit
each
other
do
think
too
unkindly
in
your
first
anger
i
am
so
very
sorry
sorry
for
you
who
must
feel
as
if
your
life
had
been
convulsed
by
an
earthquake
and
all
its
familiar
features
disarranged
sorry
for
your
father
disappointment
sorry
for
miss
cheriton
who
must
have
been
wretched
but
how
infinitely
wiser
to
draw
back
in
time
and
not
for
want
of
courage
drift
on
into
that
supreme
catastrophe
marriage
you
must
suppose
me
cynical
in
calling
it
a
catastrophe
perhaps
i
mean
it
only
in
its
harmless
sense
of
and
if
i
do
i
see
that
it
is
cynical
to
recognize
a
spade
when
you
see
it
as
certainly
a
spade
but
do
not
let
yourself
go
to
bitterness
and
so
turn
into
a
cynic
yourself
you
say
miss
cheriton
apparently
prefers
a
duke
and
are
very
angry
but
why
if
as
you
declare
you
have
not
really
loved
her
for
months
past
are
you
angry
why
should
she
not
prefer
a
duke
perhaps
he
is
quite
a
nice
one
and
you
may
be
certain
she
felt
at
once
the
very
instant
when
you
left
off
caring
for
her
about
such
things
it
is
as
difficult
for
a
woman
to
be
mistaken
as
it
is
for
a
barometer
to
be
hoodwinked
in
matters
meteorologic
it
was
that
and
never
the
duke
that
first
influenced
her
i
am
as
sure
of
it
as
if
i
could
see
into
her
heart
of
course
she
loved
you
but
no
girl
with
a
spark
of
decency
would
cling
on
to
a
reluctant
lover
what
an
exceedingly
poor
thing
in
girls
she
would
be
who
did
i
ca
tell
you
how
much
ashamed
i
am
of
that
sort
of
girl
the
girl
who
clings
who
follows
who
laments
as
if
the
world
the
splendid
amazing
world
were
empty
of
everything
but
one
single
man
and
there
were
no
sun
shining
no
birds
singing
no
winds
blowing
no
hills
to
climb
no
trees
to
sit
under
no
books
to
read
no
friends
to
be
with
no
work
to
do
no
heaven
to
go
to
i
feel
now
for
the
first
time
that
i
would
like
to
know
miss
cheriton
but
it
is
really
almost
impossibly
difficult
to
write
this
letter
each
thing
i
say
seems
something
i
had
better
not
have
said
write
to
me
about
your
troubles
as
often
as
you
feel
it
helps
you
and
believe
that
i
do
most
heartily
sympathize
with
you
both
but
do
mind
and
forgive
me
if
my
answers
are
not
satisfactory
i
am
unpracticed
and
ill
at
ease
clumsy
limited
in
this
matter
of
frank
writing
about
feelings
a
matter
in
which
you
so
far
surpass
me
but
i
am
always
most
sincerely
your
friend
schmidt
l
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
it
not
much
use
for
the
absent
to
send
bland
advice
to
exhort
to
peace
and
putting
aside
of
anger
when
they
have
only
general
principles
to
go
on
you
know
more
about
miss
cheriton
than
i
do
and
i
am
obliged
to
believe
you
when
you
tell
me
you
have
every
reason
to
be
bitter
but
i
can
make
few
comments
my
mouth
is
practically
shut
only
as
you
told
me
you
long
ago
left
off
caring
for
her
the
smart
you
are
feeling
now
must
be
it
seems
to
me
simply
the
smart
of
wounded
vanity
and
for
that
i
afraid
i
have
no
soothing
lotion
ready
also
i
am
bound
to
say
that
i
think
she
was
quite
right
to
give
you
up
once
she
was
sure
you
no
longer
loved
her
i
am
all
for
giving
up
for
getting
rid
of
things
grown
rotten
before
it
is
too
late
and
the
one
less
bright
spot
i
see
on
her
otherwise
correct
conduct
is
that
she
did
not
do
it
sooner
do
think
me
hard
dear
friend
if
i
were
your
mother
i
would
blindly
yearn
over
my
boy
as
it
is
you
must
forgive
my
unfortunate
trick
of
seeing
plainly
i
wish
things
would
look
more
adorned
to
me
less
palpably
obvious
and
ungarnished
these
tiresome
eyes
of
mine
have
often
made
me
angry
i
would
so
much
like
to
sympathize
wholly
with
you
now
to
be
able
to
be
indignant
with
miss
cheriton
call
her
a
minx
say
she
is
heartless
be
ready
with
all
sorts
of
healing
balms
and
syrups
for
you
poor
boy
in
the
clutches
of
a
cruel
annoyance
but
i
ca
if
you
could
love
her
again
and
make
it
up
that
indeed
would
be
a
happy
thing
as
it
is
and
your
letter
sets
all
hopes
of
the
sort
aside
once
and
for
ever
you
have
had
an
escape
for
if
she
had
not
given
you
up
i
do
suppose
you
would
have
given
her
up
i
do
suppose
that
is
a
thing
one
often
does
you
would
have
married
her
and
then
heaven
knows
what
would
have
become
of
your
unfortunate
soul
after
all
you
need
not
have
told
me
you
had
left
off
loving
her
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
at
the
time
i
knew
it
within
a
week
of
when
it
happened
and
i
have
always
hoped
i
can
not
tell
you
how
sincerely
that
it
was
only
a
mood
and
that
you
would
go
back
to
her
again
and
be
happy
yours
sincerely
schmidt
li
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
this
is
a
world
it
seems
to
me
where
everybody
spends
their
time
falling
out
of
love
and
making
their
relations
uncomfortable
i
have
only
two
friends
the
rest
of
my
friends
being
acquaintances
and
both
have
done
it
or
had
it
done
to
them
is
it
then
to
be
wondered
at
that
i
should
argue
that
if
it
happens
to
both
my
friends
in
a
set
where
there
are
only
two
the
entire
world
must
be
divided
into
those
who
give
up
and
those
who
are
given
up
with
a
greek
chorus
of
lamenting
and
explanatory
relatives
as
a
finish
really
one
might
think
that
love
and
its
caprices
and
its
tantrums
you
see
in
my
shrewish
mood
makes
up
the
whole
of
life
here
vicki
groaning
in
the
throes
of
a
relapse
because
some
one
has
written
that
she
met
her
late
lover
at
a
party
and
that
he
ate
only
soup
here
she
is
overcome
by
this
picture
which
she
translates
as
a
hankering
in
spite
of
everything
after
her
and
wanting
to
write
to
him
and
ready
to
console
him
and
crying
her
eyes
all
red
again
and
no
longer
taking
the
remotest
interest
in
or
in
those
frequent
addresses
of
mine
to
her
on
homely
subjects
to
which
up
to
yesterday
she
listened
with
such
flattering
respect
and
here
are
you
writing
me
the
most
melancholy
letters
longer
and
drearier
than
any
letters
ever
were
before
filled
with
yearnings
after
something
that
certainly
is
not
miss
cheriton
but
beyond
that
certainty
i
can
make
out
nothing
it
is
a
strange
and
wonderful
world
i
stand
bewildered
with
you
on
one
side
and
vicki
on
the
other
and
fling
exhortations
at
you
in
turn
i
try
scolding
to
brace
you
but
neither
of
you
will
be
braced
i
try
sympathy
to
soothe
you
but
neither
of
you
will
be
soothed
what
am
i
to
do
may
i
laugh
will
that
give
too
deep
offence
i
afraid
i
did
laugh
over
your
father
cable
from
america
when
the
news
of
your
broken
engagement
reached
him
you
ask
me
what
i
think
of
a
father
who
just
cables
to
his
son
at
a
moment
when
his
son
is
being
horribly
worried
well
you
must
consider
that
cabling
is
expensive
and
he
did
care
to
put
more
than
one
word
and
if
there
had
been
two
it
might
have
made
you
still
angrier
but
seriously
i
do
see
that
it
must
have
annoyed
you
and
i
soon
left
off
being
so
unkind
as
to
laugh
it
is
odd
how
much
older
i
feel
than
either
of
you
lamenters
quite
old
and
quite
settled
and
so
objective
somehow
i
hope
being
objective
does
make
one
unsympathetic
but
i
expect
it
really
rather
tends
that
way
and
yet
if
it
were
so
and
i
were
as
hard
and
husky
as
i
sometimes
dimly
fear
i
may
be
growing
would
you
and
vicki
want
to
tell
me
your
sorrows
and
other
people
do
too
think
of
it
papa
lindeberg
hitherto
a
long
narrow
person
buttoned
up
silently
in
black
mysterious
simply
because
he
held
his
tongue
a
reader
of
rabid
conservative
papers
through
glasses
and
as
numb
in
the
fingers
as
wordsworth
when
he
shakes
my
respectful
hand
has
begun
to
unbend
to
unfold
to
expand
like
those
japanese
dried
flowers
you
fling
into
water
and
having
started
with
good
mornings
and
weather
comments
and
politics
and
from
them
proceeded
to
the
satisfactorily
confused
state
of
the
british
army
has
gone
on
imperceptibly
but
surely
to
confidential
criticisms
of
the
mistakes
made
here
at
headquarters
in
invariably
shelving
the
best
officers
at
the
very
moment
when
they
have
arrived
at
what
he
describes
as
their
prime
and
has
now
reached
the
stage
when
he
comes
up
through
the
orchard
every
morning
at
the
hour
i
am
due
for
my
lesson
to
help
me
over
the
fence
he
comes
up
with
much
stateliness
and
deliberation
but
he
does
come
up
and
we
walk
down
together
and
every
day
the
volume
of
his
confidences
increases
and
he
more
and
more
minutely
describes
his
grievances
i
listen
and
nod
my
head
which
is
easy
and
apparently
all
he
wants
his
wife
stops
him
at
once
if
he
begins
to
her
by
telling
him
with
as
much
roundness
as
is
consistent
with
being
born
a
dammerlitz
that
the
calamities
that
have
overtaken
them
are
entirely
his
fault
why
was
he
not
as
clever
as
those
subordinates
who
were
put
over
his
head
she
asks
with
dangerous
tranquillity
and
nobody
can
answer
a
question
like
that
makes
me
twenty
years
younger
he
said
yesterday
as
he
handed
me
over
the
fence
with
the
same
politeness
i
have
seen
in
the
manner
of
old
men
handing
large
dowagers
to
their
places
in
a
set
of
quadrilles
see
your
cheerful
morning
face
you
had
said
shining
morning
face
you
have
been
quoting
shakespeare
said
i
yes
i
fear
my
shakespeare
days
are
done
i
am
now
at
the
time
of
life
when
serious
and
practical
considerations
take
up
the
entire
attention
of
a
man
shakespeare
is
more
suitable
now
for
my
daughter
than
for
me
clever
men
do
read
him
yes
ones
do
yes
beards
yes
men
yes
yes
professors
theatre
people
people
of
no
family
people
who
have
no
serious
responsibilities
on
their
shoulders
people
of
the
pen
not
men
of
the
sword
but
officers
and
who
in
our
country
of
the
is
not
was
not
or
will
not
be
an
officer
have
no
time
for
general
literature
of
course
he
added
with
a
slight
bow
for
he
regards
me
as
personally
responsible
for
everybody
and
everything
english
have
all
heard
of
him
said
i
i
was
a
boy
he
said
this
morning
read
at
school
of
a
young
woman
a
mythological
person
called
hebe
was
the
daughter
of
juno
and
wild
lettuce
said
i
may
be
he
said
parentages
of
the
mythological
period
are
curiously
intricate
but
why
is
it
dear
fräulein
schmidt
that
though
i
can
recollect
nothing
of
her
but
her
name
whenever
i
see
you
you
remind
me
of
her
now
was
not
that
very
pleasant
hebe
the
restorer
of
youth
to
gods
and
men
hebe
the
vigorous
and
wholesome
thoreau
says
she
was
probably
the
only
thoroughly
and
robust
young
lady
that
ever
walked
the
globe
and
that
whenever
she
came
it
was
spring
no
wonder
i
was
pleased
it
because
i
healthy
said
i
that
it
he
said
obviously
fumbling
about
in
his
brain
for
the
reason
and
when
he
got
to
the
house
he
displayed
the
results
of
his
fumbling
by
saying
many
people
are
healthy
said
i
and
left
him
to
think
it
out
alone
so
now
there
are
two
nice
young
women
i
been
compared
to
you
once
said
i
was
like
nausicaa
and
here
a
year
later
a
year
in
which
various
rather
salt
and
stinging
waves
have
gone
over
my
head
is
somebody
comparing
me
to
hebe
evidently
the
waves
did
me
no
harm
it
is
true
on
the
other
hand
that
papa
lindeberg
is
it
is
also
true
that
last
night
i
found
a
beautiful
shining
silvery
hair
insolently
flaunting
in
the
very
front
of
my
head
yes
my
dear
said
papa
my
papa
when
i
showed
it
him
are
growing
old
settled
and
objective
said
i
carefully
pulling
it
out
before
the
glass
yet
papachen
inside
me
i
feel
quite
young
papa
chuckled
are
no
safe
criterion
my
dear
he
said
is
the
outside
that
tells
what
woman
age
evidently
i
have
not
yet
reminded
my
own
papa
of
hebe
schmidt
lii
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
well
yes
i
do
think
you
must
get
over
it
without
much
help
from
me
you
have
a
great
deal
of
my
sympathy
i
assure
you
far
more
than
you
think
i
do
put
it
into
my
letters
because
so
much
of
it
that
it
would
make
them
overweight
also
it
would
want
a
great
deal
of
explaining
you
see
it
a
different
sort
from
what
you
expect
and
given
for
other
reasons
than
those
you
have
in
your
mind
and
it
is
quite
impossible
to
account
for
in
any
way
you
are
likely
to
understand
but
do
consider
what
as
regards
the
engagement
you
must
look
like
from
my
point
of
view
candidly
are
you
a
fit
object
for
my
compassion
i
see
you
wandering
now
through
italy
in
its
golden
autumn
looking
at
all
your
dear
luinis
and
bellinis
and
botticellis
and
other
delights
of
your
first
growing
up
and
from
my
bleak
i
watch
you
hungrily
as
you
go
november
is
nearly
upon
us
and
we
shiver
under
leaden
clouds
and
driving
rain
the
windows
are
loose
and
all
of
them
rattle
the
wind
screams
through
their
chinks
as
though
somebody
had
caught
it
by
the
toes
and
was
pinching
it
we
ca
see
out
for
the
raindrops
on
the
panes
when
i
go
to
the
door
to
get
a
breath
of
something
fresher
than
house
air
i
see
only
mists
and
wreaths
of
clouds
and
mists
again
where
a
fortnight
ago
lay
a
little
golden
town
in
a
cup
of
golden
hills
do
you
think
that
a
person
with
this
cheerless
prospect
can
pity
you
down
there
in
the
sun
i
trace
your
bright
line
of
march
on
the
map
and
merely
feel
envy
i
am
haunted
by
visions
of
the
many
beautiful
places
and
climates
there
are
in
the
world
that
i
shall
never
see
the
thought
that
there
are
people
at
this
moment
sitting
under
or
in
the
shadow
of
pyramids
fanning
themselves
with
their
handkerchiefs
while
i
am
in
my
clammy
room
the
house
gets
clammy
i
find
in
persistent
wet
weather
not
liking
to
light
a
lamp
because
it
is
only
three
and
yet
hardly
able
to
see
because
of
the
streaming
panes
and
driving
mist
the
thought
of
these
happy
people
makes
me
restive
i
too
want
to
be
up
and
off
to
run
through
the
wet
pall
hanging
over
this
terrible
gray
north
down
into
places
where
sunshine
would
dry
the
fog
out
of
my
hair
and
brown
my
face
and
loosen
my
joints
and
warm
my
poor
frozen
spirit
i
would
change
places
with
you
this
minute
if
i
could
gladly
would
i
take
the
burden
of
your
worries
on
to
my
shoulders
and
carrying
them
like
a
knapsack
lay
them
at
the
feet
of
the
first
bellini
madonna
i
met
and
leave
them
there
for
good
it
would
give
me
no
trouble
to
lay
them
down
those
worries
produced
by
other
people
one
little
shake
and
they
tumble
off
always
things
and
places
have
been
more
to
me
than
people
perhaps
it
is
often
so
with
persons
who
live
lonely
lives
anyhow
do
at
once
cry
out
that
i
unnatural
and
inhuman
for
things
are
after
all
only
filtered
out
people
their
ideas
crystallized
into
tangibleness
their
spirit
taking
visible
form
either
they
are
that
or
they
are
i
suppose
god
ideas
after
all
the
same
thing
put
into
shapes
we
can
see
and
touch
so
that
it
not
so
dreadful
of
me
to
like
them
best
to
prefer
their
company
their
silent
teaching
although
you
will
i
know
lecture
me
and
perhaps
tell
me
i
am
petrifying
into
a
mere
thing
myself
well
it
is
only
fair
that
you
should
lecture
me
who
so
often
lecture
you
yours
quite
meekly
schmidt
liii
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
i
wo
talk
about
it
any
more
let
us
have
done
with
it
let
us
think
of
something
else
i
shall
get
tired
of
the
duke
if
you
are
not
careful
so
please
save
me
from
an
attitude
so
unbecoming
this
is
all
saints
day
the
feast
of
white
chrysanthemums
and
dear
memories
my
mother
used
to
keep
it
as
a
day
apart
and
made
me
feel
something
of
its
mysticalness
she
had
a
table
in
her
bedroom
the
nearest
approach
that
was
possible
to
an
altar
with
one
of
those
pictures
hung
above
it
of
christ
on
the
cross
that
always
make
me
think
of
god
of
this
grievous
people
wrought
after
the
likeness
of
their
race
do
you
remember
and
candles
and
jars
of
flowers
and
many
little
books
and
she
used
on
her
knees
to
read
in
the
little
books
kneeling
before
the
picture
she
explained
to
me
that
the
lutheran
whitewash
starved
her
soul
and
that
she
wanted
however
clumsily
to
keep
some
reminder
with
her
of
the
manner
of
prayer
in
england
did
i
ever
tell
you
how
pretty
she
was
she
was
so
very
pretty
and
so
adorably
nimble
of
tongue
quick
glancing
vivid
she
twinkled
in
the
heavy
jena
firmament
like
some
strange
little
star
she
led
papa
and
me
by
the
nose
and
we
loved
it
i
can
see
her
now
expounding
her
rebellious
theories
sitting
limply
for
she
was
long
and
thin
in
a
low
chair
but
with
nothing
limp
about
her
face
and
eyes
shining
with
interest
in
what
she
was
talking
about
she
was
great
on
the
necessity
a
necessity
she
thought
quite
good
for
everybody
but
absolutely
essential
for
a
woman
of
being
stirred
up
thoroughly
once
a
week
at
the
very
least
to
an
enthusiasm
for
religion
and
the
life
of
the
world
to
come
she
said
there
was
nothing
so
good
for
one
as
being
stirred
up
that
only
the
well
stirred
ever
achieve
great
things
that
stagnation
never
yet
produced
a
soul
that
had
shot
up
out
of
reach
of
fogs
on
to
the
clear
heights
from
which
alone
you
can
call
out
directions
for
the
guidance
of
those
below
the
cold
empty
lutheran
churches
were
abhorrent
to
her
are
populated
on
sundays
she
said
by
stagnant
women
women
so
stagnant
that
you
can
almost
see
the
duckweed
growing
on
them
she
could
not
endure
and
i
taught
to
see
through
her
eyes
can
not
endure
either
the
chilly
blend
of
whitewash
and
painted
deal
pews
in
the
midst
of
which
you
are
required
here
once
a
week
to
magnify
the
lord
our
churches
all
those
i
have
seen
are
either
like
vaults
or
barns
the
vault
variety
being
slightly
better
and
also
more
scarce
their
aggressive
ugliness
and
cold
repellent
service
keeping
the
congealed
sinner
at
arm
length
nearly
drove
my
mother
into
the
roman
church
a
place
no
previous
watson
had
ever
wanted
to
go
to
the
churches
in
jena
made
her
think
with
the
tenderest
regard
of
the
old
picturesque
days
of
the
light
and
color
and
emotions
of
the
catholic
services
and
each
time
she
was
forced
into
one
she
said
she
made
a
bigger
stride
toward
rome
was
a
most
mischievous
person
she
would
say
glancing
half
defiantly
through
long
eyelashes
at
papa
but
he
only
chuckled
he
does
mind
about
luther
yet
in
case
he
did
in
case
some
national
susceptibility
should
have
been
hurt
she
would
get
up
lazily
her
movements
were
as
lazy
as
her
tongue
was
quick
and
take
him
by
the
ears
and
kiss
him
she
died
when
she
was
sweet
and
wonderful
to
the
last
nor
did
her
beauty
suffer
in
the
least
in
the
sudden
illness
that
killed
her
lily
in
a
she
looked
when
they
had
laid
her
out
as
your
meredith
says
and
on
this
day
every
year
this
day
of
saints
so
dear
to
us
my
spirit
is
all
the
time
in
those
long
ago
happy
years
with
her
i
have
no
private
altar
in
my
room
no
picture
of
a
christ
papa
took
that
and
no
white
flowers
in
this
drenched
autumnal
place
to
show
that
i
remember
nor
do
i
read
in
the
little
books
except
with
gentle
wonderment
that
she
should
have
found
nourishment
in
them
she
who
fed
so
constantly
on
the
great
poets
but
i
have
gone
each
all
saints
day
for
ten
years
past
to
church
in
jena
in
memory
of
her
and
tried
by
shutting
my
eyes
to
imagine
i
was
in
a
beautiful
place
without
whitewash
or
hideous
almost
brutal
stained
glass
this
morning
knowing
that
if
i
went
down
into
the
town
i
would
arrive
spattered
with
mud
up
to
my
ears
and
so
bedraggled
that
the
might
conceivably
refuse
me
admission
on
the
ground
that
i
would
spoil
her
pews
i
set
out
for
the
nearest
village
across
the
hills
hoping
that
a
country
congregation
would
be
more
used
to
mud
i
found
the
church
shut
and
nobody
with
the
least
desire
to
have
it
opened
the
rain
beat
dismally
down
on
my
umbrella
as
i
stood
before
the
blank
locked
door
a
neglected
fence
divided
the
graves
from
the
front
yard
protecting
them
i
suppose
as
much
as
in
it
lay
from
the
depredations
of
wandering
cows
on
the
other
side
of
it
was
the
manure
heap
on
which
stood
wet
fowls
mournfully
investigating
its
contents
his
windows
shut
and
impenetrable
looked
out
on
to
the
manure
heap
the
fowls
the
churchyard
and
myself
it
is
a
very
ancient
church
picturesque
and
with
beautiful
lancet
windows
with
delicate
traceries
carefully
bricked
up
not
choosing
to
have
walked
five
miles
for
nothing
and
not
wishing
to
break
a
habit
ten
years
old
of
praying
in
a
church
for
my
darling
mother
soul
on
this
day
of
souls
and
darling
saints
i
gathered
up
my
skirts
and
splashed
across
the
pools
and
knocked
modestly
at
his
door
for
the
key
the
instant
i
did
it
two
dogs
from
nowhere
two
infamous
little
dogs
of
that
unpleasant
breed
from
which
i
suppose
pomerania
takes
its
name
rushed
at
me
furiously
barking
the
noise
was
enough
to
wake
the
dead
and
since
nobody
stirred
in
the
house
or
showed
other
signs
of
being
wakened
it
became
plain
to
my
deductive
intelligence
that
its
inmates
could
be
dead
so
i
knocked
again
the
dogs
yelled
again
i
stood
looking
at
them
in
deep
disgust
quite
ashamed
of
the
way
in
which
the
dripping
stillness
was
being
rent
because
of
me
a
soothing
umbrella
shaken
at
them
only
increased
their
fury
they
seemed
like
myself
to
grow
more
and
more
indignant
the
longer
the
door
was
kept
shut
at
last
a
servant
opened
it
a
few
inches
eyed
me
with
astonishment
and
when
she
heard
my
innocent
request
eyed
me
with
suspicion
she
hesitated
half
shut
the
door
hesitated
again
and
then
saying
she
would
go
and
see
what
the
herr
pastor
had
to
say
shut
the
door
quite
i
do
not
remember
ever
having
felt
less
respectable
the
girl
clearly
thought
i
was
not
the
dogs
clearly
were
sure
i
was
not
properly
incensed
by
the
shutting
of
the
door
and
the
expression
on
the
girl
face
i
decided
that
the
only
dignified
course
was
to
go
away
but
i
could
because
of
the
dogs
the
girl
came
back
with
the
key
she
looked
as
though
she
had
a
personal
prejudice
against
me
she
opened
the
door
just
wide
enough
for
a
lean
person
to
squeeze
through
and
bade
me
with
manifest
reluctance
come
in
the
hall
had
a
brick
floor
and
an
umbrella
stand
in
the
umbrella
stand
stood
an
umbrella
and
as
the
girl
who
walked
in
front
of
me
passed
it
she
snatched
out
the
umbrella
and
carried
it
with
her
firmly
pressed
to
her
bosom
i
did
not
at
once
grasp
the
significance
of
this
action
she
put
me
into
an
icy
room
and
left
me
to
myself
it
was
the
good
room
room
used
only
on
occasions
of
frigid
splendor
its
floor
was
shiny
with
yellow
paint
and
to
meet
the
difficulty
of
the
paint
being
spoiled
if
people
walked
on
it
and
that
other
difficulty
of
a
floor
being
the
only
place
you
can
walk
on
strips
of
cocoanut
matting
were
laid
across
it
from
one
important
point
to
another
there
was
a
strip
from
the
door
to
the
window
a
strip
from
the
door
to
another
door
a
strip
from
the
door
to
the
sofa
and
a
strip
from
the
sofa
on
which
the
caller
sits
to
the
chair
on
which
sits
the
callee
a
baby
of
apparently
brand
newness
was
crying
in
an
adjoining
room
i
waited
listening
to
it
for
what
seemed
an
interminable
time
not
daring
to
sit
down
because
it
is
not
expected
in
germany
that
you
shall
sit
in
any
house
but
your
own
until
specially
requested
to
do
so
i
stood
staring
at
the
puddles
my
clothes
and
umbrella
were
forming
on
the
strip
of
matting
vainly
trying
to
rub
them
out
with
my
feet
the
wail
of
the
unfortunate
in
the
next
room
was
of
an
uninterrupted
and
haunting
melancholy
the
rain
beat
on
the
windows
forlornly
as
minute
after
minute
passed
and
no
one
came
i
grew
very
restless
my
fingers
began
to
twitch
and
my
feet
to
tap
and
i
was
cooling
down
after
my
quick
walk
with
a
rapidity
that
meant
a
cough
and
a
sore
throat
there
was
no
bell
or
i
would
have
rung
it
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
go
away
i
did
turn
round
to
open
the
door
and
try
to
attract
the
notice
and
tell
her
i
could
wait
no
longer
but
i
found
to
my
astonishment
that
the
door
was
locked
after
that
the
whole
of
my
reflections
were
resolved
into
one
chaotic
dear
me
from
which
i
did
not
emerge
till
the
parson
appeared
through
the
other
door
bringing
with
him
a
gust
of
wailing
from
the
unhappy
baby
within
and
of
the
characteristic
smell
of
infant
garments
drying
at
a
stove
he
was
cold
suspicious
inquisitive
evidently
unused
to
being
asked
for
permission
to
go
into
his
church
and
equally
evidently
unused
to
persons
passing
through
a
village
which
was
for
most
persons
on
the
way
to
nowhere
he
endeavored
with
some
skill
to
discover
what
i
was
doing
there
with
equal
skill
i
evaded
answering
his
questions
they
included
inquiries
as
to
my
name
my
age
my
address
my
profession
the
existence
or
not
of
a
husband
the
number
of
my
brothers
and
sisters
and
distinct
probings
into
the
size
of
our
income
it
struck
me
that
he
had
a
great
deal
of
time
and
very
few
visitors
except
thieves
delicately
i
conveyed
this
impression
to
him
leaving
out
only
the
thieves
by
means
of
implications
of
a
vaguely
flattering
nature
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
it
was
too
wet
for
funerals
which
were
the
only
things
doing
at
this
time
of
the
year
do
they
die
when
it
is
wet
i
asked
surprised
if
it
is
necessary
said
he
said
i
pondering
if
some
one
does
he
has
to
be
buried
put
it
off
said
he
it
off
put
it
off
he
repeated
firmly
i
began
in
a
tone
of
protest
always
a
fine
day
if
one
waits
long
enough
said
he
true
said
i
struck
by
a
truth
i
had
not
till
then
consciously
observed
he
did
not
ask
me
to
sit
down
a
careful
eye
i
suppose
having
gauged
the
probable
effect
of
my
wet
clothes
on
his
dry
chairs
so
we
stood
facing
each
other
on
the
strip
of
matting
throwing
questions
and
answers
backward
and
forward
like
a
ball
and
i
think
i
played
quite
skilfully
for
at
the
end
of
the
game
he
knew
little
more
than
when
we
began
and
so
at
last
he
gave
me
the
key
and
having
with
a
great
rattling
of
its
handle
concealed
that
he
was
unlocking
the
door
and
further
cloaked
this
process
by
a
pleasant
comment
on
the
way
doors
stick
in
wet
weather
which
i
met
with
the
cold
information
that
ours
did
he
whistled
off
the
dogs
and
i
left
him
still
with
an
inquiry
in
his
eye
the
church
is
very
ancient
and
dates
from
the
thirteenth
century
you
would
like
its
outside
i
wonder
if
in
your
walks
you
ever
came
here
but
its
inside
has
been
spoilt
by
the
zealous
lutherans
and
turned
into
the
usual
barn
in
its
first
state
of
beauty
in
those
catholic
days
what
a
haven
it
must
have
been
for
all
the
women
and
most
of
the
men
of
that
lonely
village
the
one
beauty
spot
the
one
place
of
mystery
and
enthusiasm
no
one
i
thought
staring
about
me
could
possibly
have
their
depths
stirred
in
the
middle
of
so
much
whitewash
the
inhabitants
of
these
bald
agricultural
parishes
are
not
sufficiently
spiritual
for
the
lutheran
faith
black
gowns
and
bareness
may
be
enough
for
those
whose
piety
is
so
exalted
that
ceremonies
are
only
a
hindrance
to
the
purity
of
their
devotions
but
the
ignorant
and
the
dull
if
they
are
to
be
stirred
and
especially
the
women
who
have
entered
upon
that
long
series
of
gray
years
that
begins
for
those
worked
gaunt
and
shapeless
in
the
fields
somewhere
about
and
never
leaves
off
again
if
they
are
to
be
helped
to
be
less
forlorn
need
many
ceremonies
many
symbols
much
show
and
mystery
and
awfulness
you
will
say
that
it
is
improbable
that
the
female
inhabitants
of
such
a
poor
parish
should
know
what
it
is
to
feel
forlorn
but
i
know
better
you
will
turning
some
of
my
own
words
against
me
tell
me
that
one
does
not
feel
forlorn
if
one
is
worked
hard
enough
but
i
know
better
about
that
too
and
i
said
it
only
in
reference
to
young
men
like
yourself
it
is
true
the
tragedy
of
the
faded
face
combined
with
the
uncomfortably
young
heart
which
is
the
tragedy
that
every
woman
who
has
had
an
easy
life
has
to
endure
for
quite
a
number
of
years
finds
no
place
in
the
existence
of
a
drudge
it
is
true
too
that
i
never
yet
saw
and
i
am
sure
you
did
a
woman
of
the
laboring
classes
make
efforts
to
appear
younger
than
she
is
and
it
is
also
true
that
i
have
seldom
seen
and
i
am
sure
you
have
women
of
the
class
that
has
little
to
do
leave
off
making
them
ceaseless
hard
work
and
the
care
of
many
children
do
away
very
quickly
with
the
youth
both
of
face
and
heart
of
the
poor
man
wife
and
with
the
youth
of
heart
go
the
yearnings
that
rend
her
whose
heart
whatever
her
face
may
be
doing
is
still
without
a
wrinkle
but
drudgery
and
a
lost
youth
do
not
make
your
life
less
but
more
dreary
these
poor
women
have
not
like
their
husbands
the
solace
of
the
they
go
through
the
bitterness
of
the
years
wholly
without
anæsthetics
really
i
do
think
i
can
let
you
go
on
persisting
that
they
feel
nothing
why
we
shall
soon
have
you
believing
that
only
you
in
this
groaning
and
travailing
creation
suffer
please
divest
yourself
of
these
illusions
read
my
young
friend
read
the
british
poet
crabbe
read
him
much
ponder
him
more
he
knew
all
about
peasants
he
was
a
plain
man
with
a
knack
for
rhyme
and
rhythm
that
sets
your
brain
for
weeks
who
saw
peasants
as
they
are
they
must
have
been
the
very
ones
we
have
here
in
his
pages
no
honeysuckle
clambers
picturesquely
about
their
path
no
simple
virtues
shine
in
their
faces
their
hearth
is
not
snowy
their
wife
not
neat
and
nimble
they
do
not
gather
round
bright
fires
and
tell
artless
tales
on
winter
evenings
their
cheer
is
certainly
homely
but
that
does
make
them
like
it
and
they
never
call
down
blessings
upon
it
with
moist
uplifted
eyes
grandsires
with
venerable
hair
are
rather
at
a
discount
the
young
men
way
of
trudging
can
not
be
described
as
elastic
and
their
talk
when
there
is
any
does
not
consist
of
praise
of
the
local
landowner
do
you
think
they
do
not
know
that
they
are
cold
and
underfed
and
do
not
know
they
have
grown
old
before
their
time
through
working
in
every
sort
of
weather
and
do
not
know
where
their
rheumatism
and
fevers
come
from
i
walked
back
through
the
soaking
sighing
woods
thinking
of
these
things
and
of
how
unfairly
the
goods
of
life
are
distributed
and
of
the
odd
tendency
misfortunes
have
to
collect
themselves
together
in
one
place
in
a
heap
old
thoughts
you
say
old
thoughts
as
stale
as
life
thoughts
that
have
drifted
through
countless
heads
and
after
a
while
drifted
out
of
them
again
leaving
no
profit
behind
them
but
one
ca
help
thinking
them
and
greatly
marvelling
make
the
most
you
fortunate
young
man
of
freedom
and
italy
and
sunshine
and
your
six
and
twenty
years
if
i
could
only
persuade
you
to
let
yourself
go
quite
simply
to
being
happy
our
friendship
in
spite
of
its
sincerity
has
up
to
now
been
of
so
little
use
to
you
and
a
friendship
which
is
not
helpful
might
just
as
well
not
exist
i
wish
i
knew
what
words
of
mine
would
help
you
most
how
gladly
would
i
write
them
how
gladly
would
i
see
you
in
untroubled
waters
forging
straight
ahead
toward
a
full
and
fruitful
life
but
i
am
a
foolish
ineffectual
woman
and
write
you
waspish
letters
when
i
might
if
i
had
more
insight
have
found
out
what
those
words
are
that
would
set
you
tingling
with
the
joy
of
life
yours
sincerely
schmidt
i
been
reading
some
of
the
very
beautiful
prayers
in
my
english
prayer
book
to
make
up
for
not
having
prayed
in
church
today
its
margins
are
thickly
covered
with
pencilled
comments
in
parts
like
the
psalms
and
canticles
they
overflow
into
the
spaces
between
the
verses
they
are
chiefly
notes
on
the
beauties
of
thought
and
language
and
comparisons
with
similar
passages
in
the
bible
here
and
there
between
the
pages
are
gummed
little
pictures
of
madonnas
and
christs
but
when
the
athanasian
creed
is
reached
the
tone
of
the
comment
changes
over
the
top
of
it
is
written
one
has
said
there
is
a
vein
of
dry
humor
running
through
this
creed
that
is
very
remarkable
and
at
the
end
of
each
of
those
involved
clauses
that
try
quite
vainly
yet
with
an
air
of
defying
criticism
to
describe
the
undescribable
my
mother
has
written
with
admirable
caution
liv
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
so
you
are
coming
to
berlin
next
month
i
thought
you
told
me
in
one
of
your
letters
that
washington
was
probably
going
to
be
your
first
diplomatic
post
evidently
you
are
glad
it
is
not
but
if
i
were
going
to
be
an
i
much
rather
be
it
at
washington
than
berlin
the
reason
being
that
i
not
been
to
washington
and
i
have
been
to
berlin
why
are
you
so
pleased
forgive
me
i
meant
so
much
pleased
but
it
is
strange
how
little
instinct
has
to
do
with
grammar
about
berlin
you
did
like
it
when
you
were
here
and
went
for
two
days
to
look
at
it
you
said
it
was
a
hard
white
place
full
of
broad
streets
with
nobody
in
them
you
said
it
was
barren
soulless
arid
pretentious
that
everybody
was
an
official
and
that
all
the
officials
were
rude
you
were
furious
with
a
policeman
who
stared
at
you
without
answering
when
you
asked
him
the
way
you
were
scandalized
by
the
behavior
of
the
men
in
the
local
trains
who
sat
and
smoked
in
the
faces
of
the
standing
women
and
by
those
men
who
walked
with
their
female
relations
in
the
streets
and
caused
their
parcels
to
be
carried
by
them
you
came
home
to
us
saying
that
jena
was
best
and
you
were
thankful
to
be
with
us
again
i
went
to
berlin
once
a
little
while
before
you
came
to
germany
and
did
like
it
either
but
i
did
like
it
because
it
was
so
full
because
those
streets
that
seemed
to
you
so
empty
were
bewildering
to
me
in
their
tumultuous
traffic
so
you
see
how
a
place
is
what
your
own
eye
makes
it
your
jena
or
your
london
eye
and
i
did
like
it
besides
because
we
spent
a
sulphuric
night
and
morning
with
relations
the
noise
of
the
streets
all
day
and
the
sulphur
of
the
relations
at
night
spoilt
it
for
me
we
went
there
for
a
jaunt
to
look
at
the
museums
and
things
and
stay
the
night
with
papa
brother
who
lives
there
he
is
papa
younger
brother
and
spends
his
days
in
a
bank
handing
out
and
raking
in
money
through
a
hole
in
a
kind
of
cage
he
has
a
pen
behind
his
ear
i
know
because
we
were
taken
to
gaze
upon
him
between
two
museums
and
wears
a
black
coat
on
weekdays
as
well
as
on
sundays
which
greatly
dazzled
my
who
was
with
us
i
believe
he
is
eminently
respectable
and
the
bank
values
him
as
an
old
and
reliable
servant
and
has
made
him
rich
his
salary
is
eight
thousand
marks
a
year
four
hundred
pounds
sir
four
times
as
much
as
what
we
have
and
my
used
often
and
fervently
to
wish
that
papa
had
been
more
like
him
i
thought
him
a
terrifying
old
uncle
a
parched
person
whose
soul
seemed
withdrawn
into
unexplorable
vague
distances
reduced
to
a
mere
flicker
by
the
mechanical
nature
of
his
work
he
is
ten
years
younger
than
papa
but
infinitely
more
faded
he
never
laughs
he
never
even
smiles
he
is
rude
to
his
wife
he
is
withering
to
his
daughters
he
made
me
think
of
owls
as
he
sat
at
supper
that
night
in
his
prim
clothes
with
round
gloomy
eyes
fixed
on
papa
whom
he
was
lecturing
papa
did
mind
he
had
had
a
happy
day
ending
with
two
very
glorious
hours
in
the
royal
library
and
tante
else
herring
salad
was
much
to
his
taste
thou
no
respect
heinrich
he
cried
at
last
when
my
uncle
warmed
by
beer
let
his
lecture
slide
over
the
line
that
had
till
then
divided
it
from
a
rating
thou
then
no
respect
for
the
elder
brother
and
his
white
and
reverend
hairs
but
onkel
heinrich
aware
that
he
is
the
success
and
example
of
the
family
and
as
intolerant
as
successes
and
examples
are
of
laxer
and
poorer
relations
waved
papa
banter
aside
with
contempt
and
proposed
that
instead
of
wasting
any
more
of
an
already
appallingly
wasted
life
in
idle
dabblings
in
literature
he
too
should
endeavor
to
get
a
post
however
humble
in
a
bank
in
berlin
and
mend
his
ways
and
earn
an
income
of
his
own
and
cease
from
living
on
an
income
acquired
by
marriages
my
punctuated
his
words
with
nods
of
approval
as
a
doorkeeper
eh
thou
cistern
filled
with
wisdom
cried
papa
lifting
his
glass
and
drinking
gayly
to
tante
else
who
glanced
uneasily
at
her
husband
he
not
yet
having
been
to
her
recollection
called
a
cistern
is
better
said
my
to
whom
a
man
so
punctual
so
methodical
and
so
as
onkel
heinrich
seemed
wholly
ideal
is
better
to
be
a
doorkeeper
in
she
was
seized
with
doubt
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
text
and
hesitated
bank
suggested
papa
pleasantly
ferdinand
even
in
a
bank
rather
than
dwell
in
the
tents
of
wickedness
explained
papa
to
tante
else
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
crossing
his
hands
comfortably
over
what
you
being
english
i
will
call
his
chest
my
dear
wife
poetic
way
way
ferdinand
interrupted
my
know
no
poetic
ways
is
the
same
thing
the
scriptures

onkel

with
sudden
and
explosive
bitterness
you
remember
of
course
that

for
silly
or
nonsense

that
it
is
far
more
expressive
and
also
more
rude

where

to

something

my

she
gazed
round

up
at

we
all
sat
silent
feeling
that
here
there

no

and
watched
while
she
chased
the
elusive
word
round
and
round
her

we
at
once

door

most
excellent

my

looking
round
at

with
a
sort
of
mild
surprise
at
having

in

so
much
about
something
that
was
neither
neighbors
nor
housekeeping

onkel

protested

forced
at
last
to
notice
these
comments
say
it

onkel

with
a
volcanic
vehemence
startling
in

so
trim

dear
you
do
not

to

the

refrain
from
talking

dear
heinrich
will
you
not
try
in
the
presence
of
of
relations
and
of
of
our
children
her
voice
shook
a
little
and
she
stopped
and
began
with
great
haste
and
exactness
to
fold
up
her
said
onkel
heinrich
again
irritably
pushing
back
his
chair
he
waddled
to
a
cupboard
of
course
he
does
get
much
exercise
in
his
cage
so
he
can
only
waddle
and
took
out
a
box
of
cigars
ferdinand
he
said
us
go
and
smoke
together
in
my
room
and
leave
the
dear
women
to
the
undisturbed
enjoyment
of
their
wits
do
not
smoke
said
papa
briefly
then
while
i
smoke
said
onkel
heinrich
i
fear
thee
heinrich
said
papa
fear
thy
tongue
applied
to
my
weak
places
i
fear
thine
eye
measuring
their
deficiencies
i
fear
thy
intelligence

to
be
great
exactly
said
onkel
heinrich
suddenly
facing
us
the
cigarbox
under
his

his
cross
owl

rounder
than
ever
exactly

there
is
awe
mingled
with
my
admiration
heinrich
awe
respect
terror
go
thou
man
of
brains
and
marketableness
thou
man
of

and
recognition
go
and
leave
me
here
with
these
lesser
intellects
i
fear
thee
and
i
will
not
watch
thee
smoke
and
he
got
up
and
raised
tante
else
hand
to
his
lips
with
great
gallantry
and
wished
her
after
our
pleasant
fashion
at
the
end
of
meals
a
good
digestion
but
tante
else
though
she
tried
to
smile
and
return
his
wishes
could
not
get
back
again
into
her
of
serene
and
conversational
my
uncle
waddled
away
shooting
a
sniff
of
scorn
over
his
shoulder
as
he
went
and
my
aunt
endeavored
to
conceal
the
fact
that
she
was
wiping
her
eyes
lieschen
and
elschen
began
to
talk
to
me
both
at
once
my
cleared
her
throat
and
remarked
that
successful
public
men
often
had
to
pay
for
their
successes
by
being
the
victims
at
home
of
nerves
and
that
their
wives
whose
duty
it
is
always
to
be
loving
might
be
compared
to
the
warm
and
soothing
iron
passed
over
a
shirt
newly
washed
and
deftly
by
its
smooth
insistence
flattening
away
each
crease
papa
gazed
at
my
with
admiring
astonishment
while
she
elaborated
this
image
he
had
hold
of
tante

hand
and
was
stroking
it
his
bright
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
wife
and
i
could
see
by
their
expression
that
he
was
trying
to
recall
the
occasions
on
which
his
own
creases
had
been
ironed
out
with
the
correctness
with
which
one
guesses
most
of
a
person
thoughts
after
you
have
lived
with
him
ten
years
my
guessed
what
he
was
thinking
said
public

she
remarked
i
said

i
heard
papa
assured
her
i
also
completely
understand
he
made
her
a
little
bow
across
the
table
not
heed
him
else
my
dear
he
added
turning
to
my
aunt
not
heed
thy
heinrich
he
is
but
a
barbarian
exclaimed
my
no
sighed
tante
else
is
i
who
am
impatient
and
foolish
tell
thee
he
is
a
barbarian
he
always
was
in
the
nursery
he
was
when
yet
unable
to
walk
he
crawled
to
that
spot
on
the
carpet
where
stood
my
unsuspecting
legs
the
while
my
eyes
and
hands
were
busy
with
the
playthings
on
the
table
and
fastening
his
youthful
teeth
into
them
made
holes
in
my
flesh
and
also
in
my
stockings
for
which
when
she
saw
them
my
mother
whipped
me
at
school
he
was
when
carefully
stalking
the
flea
gambolling
upon
his
garments
he
secured
it
between
a
moistened
finger
and
thumb
and
waiting
with
the
patience
of
the
savage
sure
of
his
prey
dexterously
transferred
it
at
the
moment
his
master
bent
over
his
desk
to
assure
himself
of
his
diligence
to
the
pedagogue

or
trouser
and
then
looked
on
with
that
glassy
look
of
his
while
the
victim
returned
to
his
place
on
the
platform
showed
an
ever
increasing
uneasiness
culminating
at
last
in
a
hasty
departure
and
a
prolonged
absence
as
a
soldier
he
was
for
i
have
been
told
so
by
those
comrades
who
served
with
and
suffered
from
him
but
whose
tales
i
will
not
here
repeat
and
as
a
husband
yes
my
dear
else
as
a
husband
he
has
not
lost
it
he
is
undoubtedly
a
barbarian
no
no
sighed
tante
else
yet
listening
with
manifest
fearful
interest
said
my
angrily
tongue
is
doing
what
it
invariably
does
it
is
running
away
with
you
are
married
people
always
angry
with
each
other
asked
lieschen
the
unmarried
daughter
in
a
whisper
can
i
tell
since
i
am
not
married
i
answered
in
another
whisper
are
not
whispered
elschen
with
all
the
authority
of
the
lately
married
is
only
the
old
ones
my
husband
and
i
do
not
quarrel
we
kiss
is
true
said
lieschen
with
a
small
giggle
which
was
not
without
a
touch
of
envy
have
repeatedly
seen
you
doing
it
said
elschen
placidly
there
no
alternative
i
inquired
what
do
not
know
what
you
mean
by
alternative
said
elschen
trying
to
twist
her
round
on
her
finger
but
it
twist
because
it
was
too
deeply
embedded
do
you
get
your
long
words
from
one
either
quarrel
or
kiss
i
asked
there
no
serene
valley
between
the
thunderous
heights
on
the
one
hand
and
the
swampy
enervations
on
the
other
to
this
elschen
merely
replied
while
she
stared
at
me
are
a
queer
cousin
said
lieschen
giggling
again
the
giggle
this
time
containing
a
touch
of
contempt
her
giggles
never
being
wholly
unadulterated
suppose
it
is
because
onkel
ferdinand
is
so
poor
expect
it
is
said
i
has
hardly
any
money
has
he
believe
he
has
positively
none
how
do
you
live
at
all
ca
think
it
must
be
a
habit
do
look
very
fat
can
i
when
i
not
must
come
and
see
my
baby
said
elschen
apparently
irrelevantly
but
i
do
think
it
really
was
she
thought
a
glimpse
of
that
i
am
sure
refreshing
baby
would
cure
most
heartsicknesses
yes
it
is
a
splendid
baby
said
lieschen
brightening
its
wardrobe
is
trimmed
throughout
with
the
best
swiss
embroidery
threaded
with
beautiful
blue
ribbons
it
cost
many
hundred
marks
i
assure
you
there
is
nothing
that
is
not
both
durable
and
excellent
is
a
very
rich
lady
she
gave
it
all
she
keeps
two
servants
and
they
wear
washing
dresses
and
big
white
aprons
just
like
english
servants
elschen
says
it
is
a
great
expense
because
of
the
laundry
bills
but
that
she
does
mind
if
you
were
going
to
stay
longer
and
had
got
the
necessary
costumes
we
might
have
taken
you
to
see
her
and
she
might
perhaps
have
asked
you
to
stay
to
coffee
said
i
in
a
voice
of
concern
it
is
a
pity
for
you
you
would
then
see
how
elegant
berlin
people
are
i
expect
this
she
waved
her
hand
quite
different
from
jena
and
seems
strange
to
you
but
it
is
nothing
i
assure
you
nothing
at
all
compared
to
elschen
furniture
and
food
said
i
again
with
concern
i
did
a
dreadful
thing
next
morning
at
breakfast
i
broke
a
jug
never
shall
i
forget
the
dismay
and
shame
of
that
moment
really
i
am
rather
a
deft
person
used
to
jugs
and
not
as
a
rule
of
hasty
or
unconsidered
movements
it
was
i
think
the
electric
current
streaming
out
of
onkel
heinrich
that
had
at
last
reached
me
too
and
galvanized
me
into
a
nervous
and
twitching
behavior
he
came
in
last
and
the
moment
he
appeared
words
froze
smiles
vanished
eyes
fell
and
papa
piping
alone
continued
to
be
heard
in
the
cheerless
air
i
do
know
what
had
passed
between
him
and
tante
else
since
last
we
had
seen
him
but
his
opaque
black
eyes
were
crosser
and
blacker
than
ever
perhaps
it
was
only
that
he
had
smoked
more
than
was
good
for
him
and
the
whole
family
was
punished
for
that
i
could
not
help
reflecting
how
lucky
it
was
that
we
were
his
relations
and
not
hers
what
must
happen
to
hers
if
they
ever
come
to
see
her
i
dare
not
think
it
was
while
i
was
reflecting
on
their
probable
scorched
and
shrivelled
condition
and
at
the
same
time
was
eagerly
passing
him
some
butter
that
i
do
think
he
wanted
but
that
i
was
frantically
afraid
he
might
want
that
my
zealous
arm
swept
the
off
the
table
and
it
fell
on
the
varnished
floor
and
with
a
hideous
clatter
of
what
seemed
like
malicious
satisfaction
smashed
itself
to
atoms
now
cried
my
casting
up
her
hands
all
over
am
very
sorry
i
stammered
pushing
back
my
chair
and
gathering
up
the
pieces
and
mopping
up
the
milk
with
my
handkerchief
niece
it
is
of
no
consequence
faltered
tante
else
her
eyes
anxiously
on
her
husband
consequence
cried
he
and
his
words
sounded
the
more
terrific
from
their
being
the
first
beyond
a
curt
good
morning
that
he
had
uttered
consequence
and
when
my
shameful
head
reappeared
above
the
table
and
i
got
on
to
my
feet
and
carried
the
ruins
to
a
sideboard
murmuring
hysterical
apologies
as
i
went
he
pointed
with
a
lean
finger
to
what
had
once
been
a
jug
and
said
with
an
owlish
solemnity
and
weightiness
of
utterance
i
have
never
heard
equalled
was
very
expensive
i
ca
tell
you
how
glad
how
thankful
i
was
to
get
home
yours
sincerely
schmidt
lv
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
i
shall
send
this
to
jermyn
street
as
it
can
no
longer
catch
you
in
italy
jena
is
not
on
the
way
from
london
to
berlin
and
i
do
know
what
map
persuaded
you
that
it
was
it
is
very
faithful
and
devoted
of
you
to
want
so
much
to
see
professor
martens
again
but
you
know
he
is
a
busy
man
and
for
five
minutes
with
him
as
he
rushes
from
a
lecture
to
a
private
lesson
it
hardly
seems
worth
while
to
make
such
a
tremendous
why
you
would
be
hours
pottering
about
on
branch
lines
and
at
junctions
and
would
never
i
am
certain
see
your
luggage
again
still
it
is
not
for
me
to
refuse
your
visit
to
professor
martens
on
his
behalf
who
as
yet
knows
nothing
about
it
i
merely
advise
and
you
know
i
do
not
easily
miss
an
opportunity
of
doing
that
what
another
odd
idea
of
yours
to
want
to
call
on
our
berlin
relations
has
italy
put
these
various
warm
genialities
into
your
head
i
did
not
think
i
had
made
the
heinrich
schmidts
attractive
i
was
shivering
while
i
wrote
with
renewed
horror
as
the
remembrance
of
that
evening
with
them
and
of
that
morning
rose
up
again
before
me
that
the
result
should
be
a
thirst
on
your
part
for
their
address
fills
me
with
astonishment
do
you
want
to
go
and
do
them
good
soften
onkel
heinrich
and
teach
him
to
cherish
kind
tante
else
with
the
meek
blue
eyes
and
silk
dress
you
can
not
seriously
intend
to
set
up
regular
social
intercourse
with
them
it
is
certain
you
will
never
meet
them
at
any
party
you
go
to
no
not
even
elschen
the
classes
are
with
us
divided
so
rigorously
that
the
needle
eye
was
child
play
to
the
camel
compared
to
this
other
entering
you
will
very
properly
remembering
my
cloistered
life
inquire
what
i
know
about
it
but
it
seems
to
me
only
please
do
laugh
that
i
have
seen
and
known
quite
a
good
deal
when
experience
leaves
gaps
quick
imagination
fills
them
up
the
straws
i
have
noticed
have
been
enough
to
show
me
which
way
the
wind
was
blowing
and
women
pray
remember
are
artists
at
putting
two
and
two
together
therefore
i
prophesy
that
if
you
are
at
the
english
embassy
in
berlin
fifty
years
and
meet
fresh
people
every
day
of
them
among
those
people
will
never
be
onkel
heinrich
and
tante
else
what
then
is
the
use
of
giving
you
their
address
i
will
if
you
really
seriously
wish
it
but
i
must
warn
you
that
they
would
be
intensely
surprised
by
a
call
from
you
and
it
would
in
no
way
add
to
their
comfort
the
connecting
thread
is
altogether
too
slender
papa
is
not
a
relation
whose
introductions
they
value
and
to
come
from
him
is
a
handicap
rather
than
a
recommendation
do
you
know
the
only
possible
conclusion
they
would
come
to
and
come
to
it
they
certainly
would
that
somehow
somewhere
in
a
train
or
a
shop
or
walking
you
had
seen
lieschen
and
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
and
before
you
knew
where
you
were
you
would
be
married
to
lieschen
how
sad
to
have
to
come
away
from
the
flaming
spanish
chestnuts
of
italy
and
turn
your
face
toward
london
fogs
you
do
seem
to
mind
you
never
do
seem
to
mind
the
things
that
would
fill
my
heart
with
leaden
despair
and
over
other
things
that
should
not
matter
you
cry
out
indeed
far
from
minding
you
seem
eager
to
be
off
yet
london
be
nice
in
november
and
berlin
where
you
so
soon
will
be
is
simply
horrid
it
was
in
november
that
we
were
there
and
we
splashed
about
in
a
raw
wet
cold
rain
on
the
verge
of
sleet
and
snow
a
bitter
wind
at
the
corners
the
omnibuses
all
full
we
could
not
afford
the
dearer
and
more
respectable
tram
and
everybody
we
met
had
an
unkind
strange
face
that
stared
at
us
in
spite
of
hurry
and
umbrellas
with
a
thoroughness
and
comprehensiveness
that
must
be
peculiar
to
berlin
papa
galoshes
did
fit
and
kept
coming
off
and
they
always
did
it
at
the
most
difficult
moment
generally
when
we
were
crossing
a
street
and
there
they
would
lie
scattered
beneath
hoofs
and
wheels
till
i
had
rescued
them
again
also
his
umbrella
being
old
and
never
having
been
very
strong
turned
inside
out
at
extra
gusty
corners
and
we
who
had
come
to
look
and
wonder
found
that
the
berlin
people
thought
we
had
come
to
be
looked
and
wondered
at
but
do
not
let
me
damp
your
ardor
with
these
gloomy
tales
it
is
such
an
excellent
thing
that
you
should
be
ardent
at
all
after
this
long
while
of
dissatisfaction
with
life
that
i
ought
to
cheer
you
on
and
not
talk
dreary
besides
your
umbrella
wo
mind
corners
and
you
do
not
wear
galoshes
i
wish
you
joy
then
of
your
new
post
and
hope
you
will
be
very
happy
in
it
papa
was
most
interested
to
hear
you
were
coming
so
near
us
and
sends
you
many
messages
whose
upshot
is
that
you
are
to
be
a
good
boy
and
do
him
credit
he
know
about
the
unfortunate
ending
to
your
engagement
and
i
shall
not
tell
him
for
he
would
be
sorry
and
more
and
more
as
the
days
and
months
melt
away
into
a
dream
i
am
anxious
that
he
should
not
be
made
sorry
do
you
not
think
that
old
people
should
never
be
made
sorry
yours
sincerely
schmidt
i
hope
you
will
waste
no
precious
time
coming
to
jena
to
see
professor
martens
i
heard
a
rumor
that
he
was
ill
or
away
or
something
so
that
you
would
have
your
long
and
tiresome
journey
positively
for
nothing
lvi
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
was
it
so
short
i
do
remember
this
one
shall
be
longer
then
tell
me
do
you
think
there
is
any
use
in
trying
to
cure
a
person
of
being
in
love
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
hopeless
such
cures
must
be
made
from
the
inside
outward
and
not
from
the
outside
inward
i
thought
i
was
going
to
stir
vicki
to
a
noble
independence
and
you
should
have
heard
the
speeches
i
made
her
sometimes
i
had
to
laugh
at
them
myself
they
were
such
extraordinarily
heroic
and
glowing
things
for
one
dripping
fräulein
with
none
too
brave
a
heart
to
hurl
at
another
dripping
fräulein
with
no
brave
heart
at
all
as
they
trotted
along
with
shortened
skirts
and
umbrellas
through
howling
forests
vicki
has
gone
all
to
pieces
again
and
her
eyes
are
redder
than
ever
i
do
know
whether
it
is
these
november
mists
that
have
done
it
but
certainly
after
all
my
hauling
of
her
up
the
rocks
of
proud
she
has
flopped
back
again
deeper
than
before
into
the
morass
in
which
i
found
her
it
a
perfect
bog
of
sentiment
she
sunk
in
now
i
make
her
go
for
walks
and
aim
at
doing
them
in
two
hours
thus
hoping
to
bring
out
her
in
the
form
of
healthy
perspiration
but
it
no
good
gasps
vicki
when
we
start
off
up
the
sombre
aisles
of
pines
and
see
them
stretching
away
before
us
into
a
gray
infinity
and
mark
their
reeking
trunks
black
with
damp
hoar
with
lichen
and
hear
their
sighings
and
their
creakings
through
the
patter
of
rain
on
our
umbrellas
and
feel
their
wet
breath
on
our
cheeks
what
an
empty
frightening
world
it
is
then
i
tell
her
with
what
enthusiasm
i
may
that
it
not
that
beautiful
that
we
are
young
and
strong
that
our
life
can
be
made
just
exactly
as
glorious
as
we
are
energetic
enough
to
make
it
and
she
does
believe
a
word
she
simply
shakes
her
head
and
moans
that
she
is
energetic
you
are
i
say
with
a
fine
show
of
confidence
let
us
walk
faster
who
would
dare
say
you
were
not
who
saw
you
now
wails
vicki
and
trots
along
blowing
her
nose
poor
little
soul
i
tried
kissing
her
and
it
did
no
good
either
i
petted
her
for
a
whole
day
sat
with
my
arms
round
her
had
her
head
on
my
shoulder
whispered
every
consolation
i
could
think
of
but
unfortunately
the
only
person
who
has
ever
petted
her
was
the
faithless
one
and
it
made
her
think
of
him
with
renewed
agony
and
opened
positive
sluices
of
despair
i
tried
scolding
her
the
dear
vicki
really
for
a
woman
grown
tone
but
she
gets
so
much
of
that
from
her
mother
and
besides
she
is
a
woman
grown
but
only
a
poor
unhappy
cheated
little
child
but
how
dull
how
dry
how
profitless
are
the
comfortings
of
one
woman
for
another
i
feel
it
in
every
nerve
the
whole
time
i
am
applying
them
one
kiss
from
the
wretched
man
himself
and
the
world
blazes
into
radiance
a
thousand
of
the
most
beautiful
and
eminent
verities
enunciated
by
myself
only
collect
into
a
kind
of
frozen
pall
that
hangs
about
her
miserable
little
head
and
does
nothing
more
useful
than
suffocate
her
she
has
been
inclined
to
feel
bad
ever
since
the
fatal
letter
about
the
soup
but
there
were
intervals
in
which
with
infinite
haulings
i
did
get
her
up
on
to
the
rocks
again
those
rocks
she
finds
so
barren
but
from
whose
tops
she
can
at
least
see
clearly
and
be
kept
dry
now
that
this
terrible
weather
has
come
upon
us
and
every
day
is
wetter
and
sadder
than
the
last
she
has
collapsed
entirely
if
i
could
write
as
well
as
papa
i
would
like
to
write
an
essay
on
the
connection
between
a
wet
november
and
the
renewed
buddings
of
love
frau
von
lindeberg
is
dreadfully
angry
and
came
up
and
actually
came
in
a
thing
she
has
not
done
yet
and
sat
on
the
sofa
carefully
enthroned
in
its
middle
and
well
spread
out
in
case
i
should
so
far
forget
myself
as
to
want
to
sit
upon
it
too
and
asked
me
what
nonsense
i
had
been
putting
into
the
child
head
i
exclaimed
remembering
my
noble
talk
was
getting
over
it
you
must
have
said
something
something
yes
indeed
i
said
something
never
has
one
person
said
so
many
things
before
she
stared
in
amazement
she
cried
actually
you
dared
you
have
the
effrontery
i
tell
you
what
i
said
and
for
an
hour
i
gave
the
astonished
lady
hemmed
in
on
the
sofa
by
the
table
and
by
my
chair
the
outlines
of
my
views
on
ideals
and
conduct
i
made
the
most
of
the
hour
the
outlines
were
very
thick
no
fidgeting
or
attempts
to
stop
me
were
considered
she
had
come
to
scold
she
should
stay
to
learn
well
she
said
when
i
tired
of
talking
got
up
and
removed
the
impeding
table
with
something
of
the
brisk
politeness
of
a
dentist
unhooking
the
patient
bib
and
screwing
down
his
chair
after
he
has
done
his
worst
seem
to
be
a
good
sort
of
girl
you
have
i
see
meant
no
harm
no
harm
i
neither
meant
it
nor
did
i
do
it
allow
me
to
make
the
point
clearer
and
i
prepared
to
push
back
the
table
upon
her
and
began
again
no
it
is
quite
clear
thank
you
kindly
go
on
endeavoring
then
to
influence
my
unhappy
child
for
good
i
trust
your
excellent
father
is
well
good
morning
but
influence
as
i
may
vicki
has
given
up
wearing
those
starched
shirts
with
the
high
linen
collars
and
neat
ties
in
which
she
first
dazzled
me
and
has
gone
into
nondescript
woollen
clothes
something
like
mine
she
says
it
is
because
of
the
washing
bills
but
i
know
it
to
be
but
a
further
symbol
of
her
despair
the
one
remnant
of
her
first
trimness
is
her
beautifully
brushed
hair
stooping
over
her
to
see
that
her
english
exercises
are
correct
i
like
to
lay
my
cheek
a
moment
on
it
so
lightly
that
she
does
not
notice
for
it
is
wonderful
stuff
soft
wavy
shining
and
ought
alone
without
the
little
ear
and
curve
of
the
young
cheek
without
the
silly
pretty
mouth
and
kind
straightforward
eyes
to
have
immeshed
that
stupid
man
beyond
all
possibility
of
disentangling
himself
she
was
not
made
for
milton
and
the
muses
nature
carving
her
out
moulding
her
body
and
her
mind
putting
in
a
dimple
here
and
giving
an
eyelash
an
extra
curl
there
had
a
pleasant
eye
on
a
firelit
future
for
vicki
a
cosy
sheltered
future
with
a
fender
for
her
feet
a
baby
for
each
arm
and
an
adored
husband
coming
in
at
the
end
of
the
day
to
be
fed
and
kissed
but
this
man
has
outwitted
nature
he
weighed
with
true
german
caution
vicki
and
her
dimples
against
the
tiny
portion
which
was
all
he
could
extract
from
her
parents
and
found
them
not
heavy
enough
to
make
up
for
the
alarming
emptiness
of
that
other
scale
now
vicki
fender
and
babies
and
busy
happy
life
have
vanished
into
the
land
of
never
will
be
she
will
not
find
some
one
else
to
take
his
place
she
has
a
story
attached
to
her
a
fatal
thing
here
for
a
girl
unlike
your
miss
cheriton
who
gently
waves
you
aside
and
engages
herself
without
the
least
difficulty
to
a
duke
vicki
is
a
marked
person
and
will
be
avoided
by
our
careful
and
calculating
young
men
she
is
doomed
never
to
spoil
and
tease
those
babies
never
to
spoil
and
worship
that
husband
instead
she
will
for
a
year
continue
to
range
the
hills
here
with
me
trying
to
listen
politely
to
my
admonishments
while
inwardly
she
shudders
at
the
loneliness
and
vastness
of
the
forests
and
of
life
and
then
her
parents
lease
will
be
up
and
they
and
she
will
drift
down
into
some
little
town
in
the
harz
where
retired
officers
finish
lives
grown
vegetable
and
the
years
will
pounce
upon
her
and
strip
her
one
by
one
of
her
little
stock
of
graces
suppose
i
blame
the
man
because
i
do
i
only
resent
that
he
should
have
so
much
the
best
of
it
there
is
no
law
obliging
a
man
to
marry
because
some
lovesick
girl
wants
him
to
if
i
were
a
man
i
would
never
marry
but
i
do
deplore
the
exceeding
number
of
the
girls
who
want
him
to
if
each
girl
would
say
her
prayers
and
go
her
own
way
go
about
her
business
her
parents
having
seen
to
it
that
she
should
have
a
business
to
go
about
what
a
cheerful
tearless
place
the
world
would
be
and
you
must
forgive
my
vociferousness
but
really
i
have
had
a
woeful
morning
with
vicki
who
cried
so
bitterly
into
the
pages
of
my
milton
that
the
best
part
of
is
stuck
together
and
all
the
red
has
come
off
the
edges
papa
lindeberg
came
in
at
the
end
of
the
lesson
to
offer
me
his
umbrella
to
go
home
with
is
a
wet
day
fräulein
hebe
said
he
looking
round
is
said
i
gazing
ruefully
at
my
poor
milton
the
daughters
of
the
gods
said
he
thus
mildly
do
we
continue
to
joke
together
sometimes
use
umbrellas
said
i
smiling
at
this
pleasant
old
man
this
old
man
i
thought
at
first
so
disagreeable
and
he
went
with
me
to
the
door
and
asked
me
in
an
anxious
whisper
what
i
thought
of
vicki
lasts
long
it
lasts
long
said
he
helplessly
said
i
standing
under
the
umbrella
in
the
rain
while
he
in
the
porch
rubbed
one
hand
mechanically
over
the
other
and
stared
at
me
are
a
very
fortunate
young
lady
he
said
wistfully
poor
vicki
if
she
were
more
like
you
me
is
so
clear
that
you
have
never
known
this
terrible
malady
of
love
you
have
the
face
of
a
joyful
i
began
to
laugh
and
laughed
and
laughed
till
the
umbrella
shook
showers
of
raindrops
off
each
of
its
points
he
stood
watching
me
thoughtfully
is
true
he
said
was
all
i
could
ejaculate
for
indeed
the
idea
made
me
very
merry
member
of
our
sex
said
he
ever
even
for
a
moment
caught
what
is
still
a
bright
and
untouched
maiden
fancy
was
a
young
man
once
i
began
the
jena
he
interrupted
waving
the
young
man
and
his
cakes
away
with
an
impatient
movement
of
the
hand
did
know
said
i
you
could
read
people
past
is
easy
enough
to
read
it
is
shining
so
clearly
in
your
eyes
it
is
reflected
so
limpidly
in
your
face
nice
said
i
interrupting
in
my
turn
for
my
feet
were
getting
grievously
wet
and
you
note
i
hope
with
what
industriousness
i
preserve
and
record
anything
of
a
flattering
nature
that
any
one
ever
says
to
me
but
you
shall
hear
the
other
side
too
for
i
turned
away
and
he
turned
away
and
before
i
had
gone
a
yard
my
shoelace
came
undone
and
i
had
to
go
back
to
the
shelter
of
the
porch
to
tie
it
up
and
while
i
had
my
foot
on
the
scraper
and
was
bending
down
tying
a
bow
and
a
knot
that
should
last
me
till
i
got
home
i
heard
frau
von
lindeberg
from
the
parlor
off
the
passage
make
him
the
following
speech
am
constantly
surprised
ludwig
at
the
amount
of
time
and
conversation
i
see
you
bestow
on
fräulein
schmidt
i
can
hardly
call
it
impertinence
but
there
is
something
indescribable
about
her
manners
an
unbecoming
freedom
an
almost
immodest
frankness
an
almost
naked
naturalness
that
is
perilously
near
impertinence
people
of
that
class
do
not
understand
people
of
ours
and
she
will
if
you
are
kinder
than
is
absolutely
necessary
certainly
take
advantage
of
it
let
me
beg
you
to
be
careful
and
ludwig
beginning
then
and
there
never
answered
a
word
yours
sincerely
schmidt
what
do
you
think
papa
book
has
been
refused
by
the
jena
publisher
by
three
berlin
publishers
by
two
in
stuttgart
and
one
in
leipzig
it
is
now
journeying
round
leipzig
to
the
remaining
publishers
the
first
time
it
came
back
we
felt
the
blow
and
drooped
the
second
time
we
felt
it
but
did
not
droop
the
third
time
we
felt
nothing
the
fourth
time
we
laughed
men
chuckled
papa
tickled
by
such
blindness
to
their
own
interests
none
will
have
it
we
will
translate
it
and
send
it
to
england
what
is
we
darling
i
asked
anxiously
is
you
said
papa
pulling
my
ear
said
i
scene
closes
lvii
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
it
is
strange
to
address
this
letter
to
berlin
and
to
know
that
by
the
time
it
gets
there
you
will
be
there
too
well
let
it
welcome
you
very
heartily
back
to
the
fatherland
i
think
i
know
the
street
you
are
in
it
is
facing
the
thiergarten
is
it
and
looks
north
quite
close
to
the
brandenburg
thor
i
remember
it
because
we
trudged
among
other
places
also
about
the
thiergarten
on
our
memorable
visit
and
papa
eye
caught
the
name
of
your
street
and
he
stood
for
ten
minutes
in
the
rain
giving
us
a
spirited
sketch
of
the
man
life
and
claims
to
have
a
street
called
after
him
my
waited
with
a
grim
patience
her
skirts
firmly
clutched
in
each
hand
she
had
come
to
and
to
have
things
explained
to
her
so
that
it
would
be
waste
of
a
railway
fare
not
to
look
and
listen
papa
was
in
great
splendor
that
day
so
obviously
superior
in
the
universatility
of
his
knowledge
to
either
of
us
damp
womenfolk
you
wo
get
much
sun
there
unless
your
rooms
are
at
the
back
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
undoubtedly
a
street
for
the
exclusive
and
as
even
i
could
see
to
whom
marble
steps
and
gates
convey
the
usual
lesson
i
however
would
sooner
live
in
a
kennel
facing
south
than
in
a
palace
where
the
sun
never
came
but
then
as
you
know
my
tendencies
are
incurably
kennelwards
today
i
am
humble
and
hanging
my
head
for
i
have
discovered
to
my
pain
and
horror
that
papa
and
i
are
living
well
beyond
our
income
i
expect
we
have
bought
too
many
books
and
spent
too
much
in
stamps
to
be
used
by
publishers
but
it
is
certain
that
we
already
consumed
over
seventy
pounds
of
our
yearly
hundred
and
that
we
only
took
five
months
to
do
it
in
what
do
you
think
of
that
we
have
been
squandering
money
right
and
left
somehow
there
were
no
clothes
to
buy
for
what
we
have
will
last
us
at
least
two
years
and
where
it
has
all
gone
to
i
imagine
indeed
i
am
a
useless
person
if
i
can
not
even
manage
a
tiny
house
like
this
and
make
such
sufficient
means
do
papa
has
written
to
professor
martens
to
tell
him
he
is
willing
to
take
in
a
young
man
again
willing
he
is
eager
hungry
for
a
young
man
for
he
sees
that
without
one
things
will
go
badly
with
us
and
i
remembering
the
wealth
we
enjoyed
while
collins
was
with
us
have
written
to
him
to
ask
if
he
cares
to
come
back
and
finish
learning
german
i
do
know
if
he
still
wants
to
or
rather
if
his
father
still
wants
him
to
for
german
to
joey
was
as
the
fly
in
the
apothecary
ointment
in
its
extreme
offensiveness
nor
have
i
told
papa
that
i
wrote
because
of
the
peculiar
horror
with
which
he
regards
joey
but
i
could
resist
when
i
know
that
six
months
of
joey
would
deliver
us
for
two
whole
years
from
all
young
men
whatever
and
i
hope
when
the
time
comes
if
it
ever
does
and
joey
with
it
to
persuade
papa
by
judicious
argument
of
the
eminent
desirability
of
this
particular
young
man
there
are
however
certain
difficulties
in
the
way
our
house
has
two
bedrooms
two
an
attic
a
kitchen
and
a
johanna
inhabits
the
attic
one
is
sacred
to
papa
and
his
work
the
other
is
a
scrap
room
in
which
we
have
our
meals
and
receive
frau
von
lindeberg
when
she
calls
and
i
write
letters
and
read
books
and
darn
stockings
where
then
will
joey
sleep
the
answer
is
as
clear
as
daylight
and
very
startling
joey
must
sleep
with
papa
now
that
this
truth
has
dawned
upon
me
i
spend
hours
lost
in
thoughts
of
things
like
screens
and
dividing
curtains
besides
preparing
elaborate
speeches
for
the
bringing
of
papa
to
reason
he
himself
was
the
first
to
declare
we
must
positively
take
in
a
young
man
again
and
he
surely
will
see
when
it
is
pointed
out
to
him
that
any
one
we
have
must
sleep
at
the
intervals
appointed
by
nature
i
afraid
he
see
it
in
the
case
of
every
one
except
the
fruitful
joey
it
is
most
unfortunate
that
joey
should
be
so
foolish
about
goethe
for
we
really
do
want
somebody
who
does
mind
about
money
and
i
remember
several
poor
boys
in
the
past
who
were
so
very
poor
that
on
the
days
when
my
demanded
payment
i
used
to
have
to
go
out
early
and
wander
among
the
hills
till
evening
unable
to
endure
the
sound
of
the
thalers
being
wrung
out
of
them
oh
money
is
the
most
horrid
of
all
necessities
i
am
ashamed
to
think
of
the
many
bright
hours
of
life
soiled
by
anxieties
about
it
by
meannesses
about
it
wherever
even
a
question
of
it
arises
love
and
the
graces
fly
affrighted
followed
closely
by
the
entire
troop
of
equally
terrified
muses
out
of
the
nearest
window
i
detest
it
i
do
not
want
it
but
with
all
my
defiance
of
it
i
am
crushed
beneath
the
yoke
of
the
penny
as
completely
as
everybody
else
well
do
i
know
that
penny
and
how
much
it
is
when
there
one
over
and
what
worlds
away
when
one
too
few
here
comes
johanna
to
lay
the
dinner
we
are
rankly
vegetarian
again
papa
leading
the
way
with
immense
determination
for
he
has
set
his
heart
at
this
unfortunate
juncture
on
a
new
biography
of
goethe
that
must
needs
come
out
just
now
a
big
thing
in
two
volumes
costing
a
terrible
number
of
marks
very
well
done
full
of
the
result
of
original
digging
among
archives
but
he
dare
not
buy
it
he
says
in
the
present
state
of
our
affairs
thou
not
think
he
said
his
face
in
grievous
puckers
at
the
prospect
a
renewed
and
careful
course
of
herbage
may
the
matter
right
quickly
said
i
shaking
my
head
and
pondering
privately
what
exactly
he
meant
by
the
word
renewed
he
looked
crestfallen
ultimately
i
said
wishing
to
cheer
him
ultimately
he
echoed
peevishly
word
has
a
sound
about
it
that
i
do
not
like
when
we
have
reached
thy
ultimately
i
shall
no
longer
be
in
a
state
to
desire
or
appreciate
bielschowsky
my
brain
by
then
will
be
clothed
with
grass
and
my
veins
be
streams
of
running
water
darling
said
i
putting
my
arm
through
his
be
at
least
very
nice
and
refreshing
and
extraordinarily
like
a
verse
of
the
psalms
and
for
two
days
he
has
held
out
undaunted
and
here
comes
our
lentil
soup
and
roast
apples
so
yours
sincerely
schmidt
lviii
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
this
morning
i
woke
up
and
wondered
at
the
strange
hush
that
had
fallen
on
our
house
set
so
near
to
a
sighing
restless
forest
and
i
looked
out
of
the
window
and
it
was
the
first
snow
all
night
it
must
have
snowed
for
there
was
the
most
beautiful
smooth
bank
of
it
without
a
knob
anywhere
to
show
where
lately
i
had
been
digging
from
beneath
my
window
up
into
the
forest
each
pine
tree
was
a
fairy
tree
its
laden
branches
one
white
sparkle
the
clouds
were
gone
and
by
the
time
i
had
done
breakfast
there
was
a
brilliant
blue
sky
and
the
hills
round
jena
stood
out
so
sharply
against
it
that
they
looked
as
if
somebody
had
been
at
them
with
a
hatchet
never
was
there
such
a
serene
and
silent
world
as
the
one
i
stepped
out
into
shovel
in
hand
i
had
come
to
clear
a
pathway
from
the
kitchen
to
the
pump
instead
i
stood
as
silent
as
everything
else
the
shovel
beneath
my
arm
gazing
about
me
and
drinking
in
the
purity
in
a
speechless
ecstasy
oh
the
air
anstruther
the
air
unhappy
young
man
who
did
not
breathe
it
it
was
like
nothing
you
got
in
berlin
of
that
you
may
be
very
certain
it
was
absolutely
calm
not
a
breath
stirring
it
was
icy
yet
crisp
and
du
and
then
how
wonderful
the
world
looked
after
the
sodden
picture
of
yesterday
still
in
my
mind
each
twig
of
the
orchard
trees
had
its
white
rim
on
the
one
side
exact
and
smooth
drawn
along
it
by
the
finger
of
the
north
wind
the
steps
down
from
the
back
door
had
vanished
beneath
the
loveliest
sleekest
white
covering
the
pump
till
the
day
before
and
ever
since
i
have
known
it
a
bleakly
impressive
object
silhouetted
in
all
its
lankness
and
gauntness
against
a
background
of
sky
and
mountain
was
grown
grotesque
bulky
almost
playful
its
top
and
long
iron
handle
heaped
with
an
incredible
pile
of
snow
its
spout
hung
about
with
a
beard
of
icicles
frau
von
kitchen
smoke
went
up
straight
and
pearly
into
the
golden
light
the
roofs
of
jena
were
in
blue
shadow
our
neighbor
roof
flashed
with
a
million
diamonds
in
the
sun
two
rooks
cawed
to
each
other
from
the
pine
tree
nearest
our
door
and
schmidt
said
her
morning
prayers
then
and
there
still
clinging
to
her
shovel
then
she
pulled
off
her
coat
hung
her
hat
on
the
and
began
in
a
sort
of
high
rapture
to
make
a
pathway
to
the
pump
what
are
the
joys
of
summer
to
these
there
is
nothing
like
it
nothing
nothing
in
the
world
i
know
no
mood
of
nature
that
i
do
not
love
or
think
i
do
when
it
is
over
but
for
keenness
of
feeling
for
stinging
pleasure
for
overflowing
life
give
me
a
winter
day
with
the
first
snow
a
clear
sky
and
the
thermometer
ten
degrees
réaumur
below
zero
vicki
called
out
from
her
doorway
you
could
hear
the
least
call
this
morning
at
an
extraordinary
distance
to
ask
if
i
were
snowed
up
too
much
to
come
down
as
usual
coming
down
and
i
making
the
path
to
do
it
with
i
called
back
shovelling
with
an
energy
that
set
my
hair
dancing
about
my
ears
she
shouted
back
her
very
shout
was
cheerful
and
i
did
not
need
to
see
her
face
to
know
that
today
there
would
be
no
tears
that
she
too
would
make
a
path
up
to
meet
mine
and
presently
i
heard
the
sounds
of
another
joyful
shovel
underneath
the
ground
was
hard
with
frost
it
had
frozen
violently
for
several
hours
before
the
snow
came
up
on
the
huge
purple
wings
of
the
north
wind
the
muddy
roads
the
soaked
forest
the
plaintive
patter
of
the
rain
were
wiped
out
of
existence
between
a
sleeping
and
a
waking
this
was
no
world
in
which
to
lament
this
was
no
place
in
which
sighs
were
possible
the
thought
that
a
man
marrying
one
or
not
could
make
so
much
as
the
faintest
smudge
across
the
bright
hopefulness
of
life
made
me
laugh
aloud
with
healthiest
derision
oh
how
my
shovel
rang
against
the
frozen
stones
the
feathery
snow
was
scattered
broadcast
at
each
stroke
my
body
glowed
and
tingled
my
hair
grew
damp
about
my
forehead
the
sun
smiled
broadly
down
upon
my
back
papa
flung
up
his
window
to
cheer
me
on
but
shut
it
again
with
a
slam
before
he
had
well
got
out
his
words
johanna
came
for
an
instant
to
the
door
peeped
out
gasped
that
it
was
cold
was
her
strange
expression
uncanny
think
of
it
and
shut
the
door
as
hurriedly
as
papa
had
shut
the
window
an
hour
later
two
hot
and
smiling
young
women
met
together
on
the
path
they
had
shovelled
and
straightened
themselves
up
and
looked
proudly
at
the
results
of
their
work
and
laughed
at
each
other
scarlet
faces
and
at
the
way
their
noses
and
chins
were
covered
with
tiny
beads
if
it
were
august
and
we
been
reaping
said
vicki
and
the
big
girl
laughed
at
this
and
the
small
girl
laughed
at
this
with
an
excessiveness
that
would
have
convinced
a
that
somebody
was
being
very
droll
but
there
was
no
you
do
pass
by
if
snow
lies
on
the
roads
three
feet
deep
we
are
cut
off
entirely
from
jena
and
shops
this
letter
wo
start
for
i
have
an
idea
how
long
milk
can
not
come
to
us
and
we
can
not
go
to
where
there
is
a
cow
i
have
flour
enough
to
bake
bread
with
for
about
ten
days
unless
the
lindebergs
should
have
none
in
which
case
it
will
last
less
than
five
the
is
stored
with
cabbages
and
carrots
buried
with
cunning
circumvention
of
decay
in
sand
potatoes
abound
in
heaps
out
of
doors
apples
abound
in
johanna
attic
we
vegetarians
come
off
well
on
occasions
like
this
for
the
absence
of
milk
and
butter
does
not
afflict
the
already
sorely
afflicted
and
of
course
the
absence
of
meat
leaves
us
completely
cold
vicki
and
i
have
been
mending
a
boy
sled
we
found
in
the
lumber
room
of
their
house
i
suppose
the
sled
used
in
his
happier
days
by
the
now
chained
to
a
desk
in
berlin
and
with
this
we
are
going
out
after
coffee
this
afternoon
when
the
sky
turns
pale
green
and
stars
come
out
and
blink
at
us
to
the
top
of
the
road
where
it
joins
the
forest
dragging
the
sled
up
as
best
we
can
over
the
frozen
snow
and
then
tightly
clutching
each
other
and
i
expect
not
altogether
in
silence
we
intend
to
career
down
again
as
far
as
the
thing
will
career
flashing
we
hope
past
her
mother
gate
at
a
speed
that
will
prevent
all
interference
perhaps
we
shall
not
be
able
to
stop
and
will
be
landed
at
last
in
the
middle
of
the
in
jena
i
take
this
letter
with
me
in
case
that
happens
because
then
i
can
post
it
it
going
to
be
glorious
do
you
wish
you
had
a
sled
and
a
mountain
too
yours
in
a
great
hurry
schmidt
lix
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
we
are
still
in
sunshine
and
frost
up
here
and
are
all
very
happy
we
three
schmidts
johanna
is
the
third
because
joey
arrives
and
we
shall
once
more
roll
in
money
i
hasten
to
tell
you
this
for
there
were
signs
in
your
last
two
letters
that
you
were
taking
our
position
to
heart
it
is
wonderfully
kind
i
think
the
way
you
are
interested
in
our
different
little
pains
and
pleasures
i
am
often
more
touched
than
i
care
to
tell
you
by
the
sincerity
of
your
sympathy
with
all
we
do
and
feel
very
grateful
for
so
true
a
friend
i
was
so
glad
you
gave
up
coming
to
jena
on
your
way
to
berlin
for
it
showed
that
you
try
to
be
reasonable
and
then
you
know
professor
martens
goes
to
berlin
himself
every
now
and
then
to
take
sweet
counsel
with
men
like
harnack
so
you
will
be
sure
to
see
him
sooner
or
later
and
see
him
comfortably
without
a
rush
to
catch
a
train
you
say
you
did
not
come
because
i
urged
you
not
to
and
that
in
all
things
you
want
to
please
me
well
i
would
prefer
to
suppose
you
a
follower
of
that
but
excellent
guide
common
sense
still
being
human
the
less
lofty
and
conscientious
side
of
me
does
like
to
know
there
is
some
one
who
wishes
to
please
me
i
feel
deliciously
flattered
when
i
let
myself
think
of
it
nearly
always
i
take
care
to
think
of
something
else
that
a
young
man
of
your
undoubted
temporal
and
spiritual
advantages
should
be
desirous
of
pleasing
an
obscure
person
like
me
what
would
frau
von
lindeberg
say
do
you
remember
shelley
sister
the
miss
westbrook
who
brushed
her
hair
so
much
with
her
constant
heavens
what
would
miss
warne
say
i
feel
inclined
to
exclaim
the
same
thing
about
frau
von
lindeberg
but
with
an
opposite
meaning
and
it
is
really
very
surprising
that
you
should
be
so
kind
for
i
have
been
a
shrew
to
you
often
and
have
been
absorbed
in
my
own
affairs
and
have
not
erred
on
the
side
of
about
yours
some
day
when
we
are
both
very
old
perhaps
you
will
get
a
few
leave
from
the
dowager
duchess
you
marry
when
you
are
forty
and
will
come
and
look
at
my
pigs
and
my
garden
and
sit
with
me
before
the
fire
and
talk
over
our
long
friendship
and
all
the
long
days
of
our
life
and
i
when
i
hear
you
are
coming
shall
be
in
a
flutter
and
will
get
out
my
best
dress
and
will
fuss
over
things
like
asparagus
and
a
salad
and
tell
the
heated
and
maid
that
his
britannic
ambassador
at
the
best
place
to
be
an
ambassador
in
in
the
world
is
coming
to
supper
and
we
shall
feel
how
sweet
it
is
to
be
old
dear
friends
meanwhile
we
are
both
very
busy
with
the
days
we
have
got
to
now
today
for
instance
has
been
so
violently
active
that
every
bone
i
possess
is
aching
i
tell
you
what
happened
since
you
so
earnestly
assure
me
that
all
we
do
interests
you
the
snow
is
frozen
so
hard
that
far
from
being
cut
off
as
i
had
feared
from
shops
and
food
there
is
the
most
glorious
sledding
road
down
to
jena
and
at
once
on
hearing
of
imminence
vicki
and
i
coasted
down
on
the
sled
and
i
bought
the
book
papa
has
been
wanting
and
a
gigantic
piece
of
beef
then
we
persuaded
a
small
but
strong
boy
a
boy
of
open
countenance
and
superior
manners
whom
we
met
in
the
to
drag
the
sled
with
the
beef
and
the
book
up
the
hill
again
for
us
and
so
we
set
out
homeward
walking
gayly
one
on
each
side
of
him
encouraging
him
with
loud
admiration
of
his
prowess
said
i
when
i
knew
a
specially
steep
bit
was
coming
what
a
great
thing
it
is
to
be
able
to
draw
so
much
so
easily
a
smirk
and
renewed
efforts
were
the
result
of
this
speech
at
first
but
the
smirk
grew
smaller
as
the
hill
grew
steeper
and
the
efforts
dwindled
to
vanishing
point
with
the
higher
windings
of
the
road
at
last
there
was
no
smirk
at
all
and
at
my
sixth
repetition
of
the
encouragement
he
stopped
dead
it
is
such
a
great
thing
he
said
wiping
his
youthful
forehead
with
a
patched
sleeve
and
looking
at
me
with
a
precociousness
i
had
not
till
then
observed
in
his
eyes
do
you
not
do
it
yourself
vicki
and
i
stared
at
each
other
in
silent
wonder
i
said
turning
a
reproachful
gaze
on
him
my
dear
little
boy
i
desire
you
to
have
the
chance
of
earning
the
fifty
pfennings
we
have
promised
to
give
you
when
we
get
to
the
top
he
began
to
pull
again
but
no
longer
with
any
pride
in
his
performance
vicki
and
i
walked
in
silence
behind
and
at
the
next
steep
bit
instead
of
repeating
a
form
of
words
i
felt
had
grown
vain
i
skilfully
unhooked
the
parcel
of
meat
hanging
on
the
runner
and
carried
it
and
vicki
always
quick
to
follow
my
example
unhooked
the
biography
of
goethe
from
the
runner
and
carried
that
the
sled
leaped
forward
and
for
a
space
the
boy
climbed
with
greater
vigor
then
came
another
long
steep
bit
and
he
flagged
again
come
said
i
is
quite
easy
he
at
once
stopped
and
wiped
his
forehead
it
is
easy
he
asked
do
you
not
do
it
yourself
my
dear
little
boy
said
i
trying
to
be
patient
but
meat
is
heavy
and
i
knew
it
to
be
raw
and
i
feared
every
moment
to
feel
a
dreadful
dampness
oozing
through
the
paper
and
i
was
out
of
breath
and
no
longer
completely
calm
engaged
to
pull
it
up
for
us
and
having
engaged
to
do
it
it
is
your
duty
to
do
it
i
will
not
come
between
a
boy
and
his
duty
the
boy
looked
at
vicki
she
talks
he
said
vicki
and
i
again
stared
at
each
other
in
silent
wonder
and
while
we
were
staring
he
pulled
the
sled
sideways
across
the
road
and
sat
down
come
said
i
striving
after
a
brisk
severity
am
tired
he
said
leaning
his
chin
on
his
hand
and
studying
first
my
face
and
then
vicki
with
a
detached
impartial
scrutiny
too
are
tired
said
i
see
yet
we
carry
the
heavy
parcels
for
you
the
sled
empty
is
quite
light
why
do
you
not
pull
it
yourself
he
asked
again
said
vicki
he
sits
there
we
need
hold
these
great
things
and
she
put
the
volumes
on
the
sled
and
i
let
the
meat
drop
on
it
which
it
did
with
a
horrible
soft
heavy
thud
the
boy
sat
motionless
him
get
his
wind
said
vicki
turning
away
to
look
over
the
edge
of
the
road
at
the
view
afraid
he
a
bad
little
boy
said
i
following
her
and
gazing
too
at
the
sparkling
hills
across
the
valley
bad
little
boy
encased
in
an
outer
semblance
of
innocence
only
wants
his
wind
said
vicki
shows
no
symptoms
of
not
having
got
it
said
i
for
the
boy
was
very
calm
and
his
mouth
was
shut
sweetly
in
a
placid
curve
we
waited
looking
at
the
view
humanely
patient
as
became
two
highly
civilized
persons
the
boy
got
up
after
a
few
minutes
and
shook
himself
am
rested
he
announced
with
a
sudden
return
to
the
politeness
that
had
charmed
us
in
jena
certainly
was
rather
a
long
pull
up
said
i
kindly
softened
by
his
manner
said
he
i
will
not
keep
the
ladies
waiting
longer
and
he
did
not
for
he
whisked
the
sled
round
sat
himself
upon
it
and
before
we
had
in
the
least
understood
what
was
happening
he
and
it
and
the
books
for
papa
and
the
beef
for
joey
were
darting
down
the
hill
skimming
along
the
track
with
the
delicious
swiftness
none
knew
and
appreciated
better
than
we
did
at
the
bend
of
the
road
he
gave
a
joyful
whoop
and
waved
his
cap
then
he
disappeared
vicki
and
i
stared
at
each
other
once
more
in
silent
wonder
an
abandoned
little
boy
she
gasped
at
last
he
must
have
been
almost
in
jena
by
the
time
we
were
able
to
speak
poor
beef
said
i
very
ruefully
for
it
was
a
big
piece
and
had
cost
vast
sums
and
the
books
said
vicki
and
the
sled
said
i
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
hurry
down
after
him
and
seek
out
the
authorities
and
set
them
in
pursuit
and
so
we
hurried
as
much
as
can
be
hurried
over
such
a
road
tired
silent
and
hungry
and
both
secretly
nettled
to
the
point
of
madness
at
having
been
so
easily
circumvented
by
one
small
boy
boys
are
more
pestilential
than
almost
anything
i
know
said
vicki
after
a
period
of
speechless
crunching
over
the
snow
more
than
anything
i
know
said
i
thankful
i
did
not
marry
said
she
am
i
said
i
world
much
too
full
of
them
as
it
is
said
she
said
i
she
cried
suddenly
stamping
her
foot
i
could
only
get
hold
of
him
wicked
wicked
little
wretch
would
you
do
i
asked
curious
to
see
if
her
plans
were
at
all
like
mine
r
r
r
r
said
vicki
clenching
all
those
parts
of
her
such
as
teeth
and
fists
that
would
clench
so
would
i
i
cried
we
were
almost
at
the
bottom
the
road
was
making
its
final
bend
and
as
we
turned
the
corner
behold
the
boy
his
cap
off
his
head
bent
his
shoulders
straining
at
the
rope
pulling
the
sled
laboriously
up
again
and
there
was
the
beef
hung
on
one
runner
and
there
were
the
books
hung
on
the
other
we
both
stopped
dead
arrested
by
this
spectacle
he
was
almost
upon
us
before
he
saw
us
so
intent
was
he
on
his
business
his
eyes
on
the
ground
the
sun
shining
on
his
yellow
hair
the
drops
of
labor
rolling
down
his
crimson
cheeks
he
panted
pausing
when
he
saw
our
four
boots
in
a
row
in
his
path
and
had
looked
up
and
recognized
the
rest
of
us
am
i
there
already
i
cried
in
the
voice
of
justified
anger
are
not
there
you
are
here
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
mountain
now
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
said
he
grinning
and
wiping
his
face
with
his
sleeve
it
was
a
good
ride
have
only
just
escaped
the
police
and
prison
i
said
still
louder
were
on
our
way
to
hand
you
over
to
them
i
had
been
there
to
hand
said
he
winking
at
vicki
to
whom
he
had
apparently
taken
a
fancy
that
was
in
no
way
encouraged
had
stolen
our
sled
and
our
parcels
i
continued
glaring
down
on
him
they
are
they
are
all
here
what
more
do
you
want
said
he
she
talks
he
added
turning
to
vicki
and
thrusting
out
his
underlip
with
an
expression
that
could
only
mean
disgust
are
a
very
naughty
little
boy
said
vicki
me
the
rope
and
be
off
me
my
fifty
pfennings
fifty
pfennings
we
exclaimed
with
one
voice
promised
me
fifty
pfennings
pull
the
sled
up
to
the
top
am
ready
to
do
it
you
we
have
had
enough
let
the
rope
go
get
home
to
your
mother
ask
her
to
give
you
a
thorough
bargain
is
a
bargain
said
the
boy
planting
himself
squarely
in
front
of
me
while
i
adjusted
the
rope
over
my
shoulders
and
prepared
to
pull
run
away
you
very
naughty
little
boy
said
i
pulling
sideways
to
pass
him
by
he
stepped
aside
too
and
faced
me
again
promised
me
fifty
pfennings
he
said
pull
the
sled
up
am
willing
to
do
it
and
coast
down
again
as
soon
as
you
have
got
to
the
top
be
off
with
you
we
are
not
playing
games
promise
is
a
promise
said
the
boy
remove
him
from
my
path
said
vicki
took
him
by
the
arm
and
gingerly
drew
him
on
one
side
and
i
started
up
the
hill
surprised
to
find
what
hard
work
it
was
am
coming
too
said
the
boy
you
said
vicki
to
fetch
my
fifty
pfennings
we
said
no
more
i
could
because
i
was
so
breathlessly
pulling
and
vicki
marched
by
my
side
in
indignant
silence
with
a
jealous
eye
divided
between
the
parcels
and
the
boy
he
unencumbered
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
beguiled
the
way
by
shrilly
whistling
at
each
winding
of
the
road
when
vicki
and
i
changed
places
he
renewed
his
offer
to
fulfil
his
first
bargain
but
we
more
and
more
angry
as
we
grew
hotter
and
hotter
refused
with
an
ever
increasing
wrath
come
said
he
when
a
very
steep
bit
had
forced
me
to
pause
and
struggle
for
breath
come
and
he
imitated
my
earlier
manner
is
quite
easy
i
looked
at
him
with
what
of
majesty
i
could
and
answered
not
a
word
at
vicki
gate
he
was
still
with
us
will
see
you
safely
home
vicki
said
to
me
when
we
got
there
where
you
live
inquired
the
boy
peeping
through
the
bars
of
the
gate
with
cheerful
interest
little
house
we
were
silent
will
see
her
home
he
said
to
vicki
you
do
want
to
but
she
can
surely
take
care
of
herself
a
great
girl
like
that
we
were
silent
at
my
gate
he
was
still
with
us
where
she
lives
he
asked
vicki
again
peeping
through
the
bars
with
cheerful
interest
little
house
we
were
silent
in
silence
we
opened
the
gate
and
dragged
the
sled
in
he
came
too
can
not
come
in
here
said
vicki
is
private
property
only
wish
to
fetch
my
fifty
pfennings
said
he
will
save
you
trouble
if
i
come
to
the
door
we
went
in
in
silence
and
together
carried
the
sled
inside
a
thing
we
had
not
yet
done
and
took
it
with
immense
exertions
into
the
parlor
and
put
it
under
the
table
and
tied
it
by
each
of
its
four
corners
to
each
of
the
table
four
legs
said
vicki
scrambling
to
her
feet
again
and
looking
at
her
knots
with
satisfaction
safe
if
anything
is
i
went
with
her
to
the
door
the
boy
was
still
there
cap
in
hand
very
polite
very
patient
my
fifty
pfennings
he
asked
pleasantly
i
can
not
explain
what
we
did
next
i
pulled
out
my
purse
and
paid
him
which
was
surprising
enough
but
vicki
to
whom
fifty
pfennings
are
also
precious
pulled
out
hers
too
and
gave
him
fifty
on
her
own
account
i
am
quite
unable
to
explain
either
her
action
or
mine
the
boy
made
us
each
the
politest
bow
his
cap
sweeping
the
snow
he
said
to
vicki
jerking
his
head
my
way
think
she
is
the
prettiest
but
you
are
certainly
the
best
and
he
left
us
to
settle
it
between
us
and
walked
away
shrilly
whistling
and
i
am
so
tired
that
my
very
pen
has
begun
to
ache
so
schmidt
oh
i
must
tell
you
that
papa
refused
to
have
joey
sleep
in
his
room
with
a
flatness
that
put
a
stop
to
my
arguments
before
they
were
even
begun
he
cried
will
not
and
when
i
opened
my
mouth
to
produce
the
arguments
he
cried
again
will
not
he
drowned
my
speech
he
would
not
listen
he
would
not
reason
through
the
house
resounded
his
cry
i
will
not
i
was
in
despair
but
everything
has
arranged
itself
joey
is
to
have
the
room
on
the
ground
floor
of
our
neighbor
house
and
will
come
up
here
for
lessons
and
meals
he
is
only
to
sleep
down
there
and
will
be
all
day
here
we
telegraphed
to
weimar
to
ask
about
it
and
the
ever
kind
owner
immediately
agreed
frau
von
lindeberg
is
displeased
for
she
says
no
dammerlitz
has
ever
yet
been
known
to
live
in
a
house
where
there
was
a
lodger
a
common
lodger
she
said
first
but
corrected
herself
and
covered
up
the
common
with
a
cough
lx
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
i
must
write
though
it
is
late
to
tell
you
of
my
speechless
surprise
when
i
came
in
an
hour
ago
and
found
you
had
been
here
i
knew
you
had
the
moment
i
came
in
at
once
i
recognized
the
smell
of
the
cigarettes
you
smoke
i
went
upstairs
and
called
johanna
for
i
was
not
sure
that
you
were
not
still
here
in
the
parlor
and
frankly
i
was
not
going
down
if
you
were
for
i
do
not
choose
to
have
my
fastnesses
stormed
she
told
me
of
your
visit
how
you
had
come
up
on
foot
soon
after
vicki
and
joey
and
i
had
started
off
for
an
afternoon
tobogganing
on
the
hills
how
you
had
stayed
talking
to
papa
and
talking
and
talking
till
you
had
to
hurry
down
to
catch
the
last
train
he
bade
me
greet
you
for
him
finished
johanna
said
i
do
you
like
winter
excursions
into
the
country
is
berlin
boring
you
already
i
shook
my
head
in
grave
disapproval
as
johanna
proceeded
with
her
tale
i
am
all
for
a
young
man
attending
to
his
business
and
not
making
sudden
wild
journeys
that
take
him
away
for
a
whole
day
and
most
of
a
night
papa
was
delighted
i
must
say
to
have
had
at
last
as
he
told
me
with
disconcerting
warmth
at
last
after
all
these
months
an
intelligent
conversation
but
with
his
delight
the
success
of
your
visit
ends
for
when
i
heard
of
it
i
was
not
delighted
at
all
why
did
you
go
into
the
kitchen
johanna
says
you
would
go
and
then
that
you
went
out
hatless
at
the
back
door
and
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
garden
and
that
you
stood
there
leaning
against
the
fence
as
though
it
were
summer
without
a
hat
said
johanna
in
her
turn
shaking
her
head
dieser
dieser
indeed
yes
what
made
you
do
it
i
am
glad
i
was
out
for
i
do
not
care
to
look
on
while
the
usually
reasonable
behave
unaccountably
i
do
think
i
can
be
friends
with
you
for
a
little
after
this
i
think
i
really
must
quarrel
for
it
is
very
decent
to
drop
unexpectedly
upon
a
person
who
from
time
to
time
has
told
you
with
the
frankness
that
is
her
most
marked
feature
that
she
does
want
to
be
dropped
upon
no
doubt
you
wished
to
see
papa
as
well
and
on
your
way
through
jena
professor
martens
but
i
will
not
pretend
to
suppose
your
call
was
not
chiefly
intended
for
me
for
it
is
to
me
and
not
to
either
of
those
wiser
ones
that
you
have
written
every
day
for
months
past
you
are
a
strange
young
man
heaven
knows
what
you
have
accustomed
yourself
to
imagining
me
to
be
i
almost
wish
now
that
you
had
seen
me
when
i
came
in
from
our
violent
exercise
a
touzled
heated
person
it
might
have
cured
you
i
forgot
to
look
in
the
glass
but
of
course
my
hair
and
eyelashes
were
as
white
with
as
vicki
and
joey
and
from
beneath
them
and
from
above
my
collar
must
have
emerged
just
such
another
glowing
nose
even
papa
was
struck
by
my
appearance
after
having
gazed
i
suppose
for
hours
on
your
composed
correctness
and
remarked
that
living
in
the
country
did
not
necessarily
mean
a
complete
return
to
savage
nature
the
house
feels
very
odd
so
do
i
it
feels
haunted
so
do
i
want
to
scold
you
and
yet
i
can
not
i
have
the
strangest
desire
to
cry
it
is
the
thought
that
you
came
this
long
way
toiled
up
this
long
hill
waited
those
long
hours
all
to
see
some
one
who
is
glad
to
have
missed
you
that
makes
me
want
to
the
night
is
so
black
outside
my
window
and
somewhere
through
that
blackness
you
are
travelling
at
this
moment
disappointed
across
the
endless
frozen
fields
and
forests
that
you
must
go
through
inch
by
inch
before
you
reach
berlin
why
did
you
do
a
thing
so
comfortless
and
here
have
i
actually
begun
to
cry
i
think
because
it
is
so
dark
and
you
are
not
yet
home
schmidt
lxi
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
i
do
quite
understand
purely
motherly
i
should
say
perhaps
our
notions
of
the
exact
meaning
of
the
word
friend
are
different
i
include
in
it
a
motherly
and
sisterly
interest
in
bodily
in
dry
socks
warm
feet
regular
meals
i
do
not
like
my
friend
to
be
out
on
a
bitter
night
to
take
a
tiring
journey
to
be
disappointed
my
friend
mother
would
have
i
imagine
precisely
the
same
feeling
my
friend
should
not
then
mistake
mere
motherliness
for
other
and
less
comfortable
sentiments
but
i
am
busy
today
and
have
no
time
to
puzzle
out
your
letter
it
must
have
been
the
outcome
of
a
rather
strange
mood
yours
sincerely
schmidt
tell
me
more
about
your
daily
life
in
berlin
the
people
you
see
the
houses
you
go
to
the
attitude
kind
or
otherwise
of
your
chief
tell
me
these
things
instead
of
swamping
me
with
subtleties
of
sentiment
i
do
understand
subtleties
and
i
fear
and
despise
sentiment
as
a
certain
spoiler
of
plain
happiness
there
should
be
no
sentiment
between
friends
the
moment
there
is
they
leave
off
being
just
friends
and
is
not
that
what
we
both
most
want
to
be
lxii
galgenberg
oh
i
can
do
nothing
with
you
you
are
bent
i
afraid
on
losing
your
friend
do
write
me
such
letters
do
do
do
my
heart
sinks
when
i
see
you
deliberately
setting
about
strangling
our
friendship
am
i
to
lose
it
then
that
too
your
last
letters
are
like
bad
dreams
so
strange
and
unreasonable
so
without
the
least
order
or
i
read
them
with
my
fingers
in
my
ears
an
instinctive
foolish
movement
of
protection
against
words
i
do
not
want
to
hear
dear
friend
do
not
take
your
friendship
from
me
give
yourself
a
shake
come
out
from
those
vain
imaginings
your
soul
has
gone
to
dwell
among
what
shall
i
talk
to
you
about
this
bright
winter
morning
yes
i
will
write
you
longer
letters
you
need
beg
so
hard
as
though
the
stars
could
get
along
in
their
courses
if
i
did
see
i
am
willing
to
do
anything
to
keep
my
friend
you
are
my
only
one
the
only
person
in
the
world
to
whom
i
tell
the
silly
thoughts
that
come
into
my
head
and
so
get
rid
of
them
you
listen
and
you
are
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
does
you
help
me
and
i
in
my
turn
want
to
be
allowed
to
go
on
helping
you
do
not
put
an
end
to
what
is
precious
believe
me
it
will
grow
more
and
more
precious
with
years
do
not
in
the
heat
and
impatience
of
youth
kill
the
poor
goose
who
if
left
alone
will
lay
the
most
beautiful
golden
eggs
what
shall
i
talk
to
you
about
to
turn
your
attention
somewhere
else
somewhere
far
removed
from
that
unhappy
bird
shall
i
tell
you
about
papa
book
finally
refused
by
every
single
publisher
come
back
battered
and
draggled
to
be
galvanized
by
me
into
fresh
life
in
an
english
translation
shall
i
tell
you
how
i
sit
for
three
hours
daily
doing
it
pen
in
hand
ink
on
fingers
hair
pushed
back
from
an
anxious
brow
papa
hovering
behind
with
a
dictionary
in
which
full
of
distrust
he
searches
as
i
write
to
see
if
it
contains
the
words
i
have
used
shall
i
tell
you
about
joey
whose
first
disgust
at
finding
himself
once
more
with
us
has
given
place
by
degrees
that
grow
visibly
wider
to
a
rollicking
enjoyment
less
and
less
does
he
come
up
here
more
and
more
does
he
stay
down
there
he
hurries
through
his
lessons
with
a
speed
that
leaves
papa
speechless
and
is
off
and
hauling
the
sled
up
past
our
gate
with
vicki
walking
demurely
beside
him
and
is
whizzing
down
again
past
our
gate
with
vicki
sitting
demurely
in
front
of
him
before
papa
is
well
through
the
list
of
adjectives
he
applies
to
him
once
at
least
every
day
i
never
see
the
sled
now
nearer
than
in
the
distance
vicki
wears
her
stiff
shirts
again
and
her
neat
ties
again
and
the
sporting
belt
that
makes
her
waist
look
so
very
trim
and
tiny
if
anything
she
is
more
aggressively
starched
and
boyish
than
before
her
collars
seem
to
grow
higher
and
cleaner
each
time
i
see
her
her
hat
is
tilted
further
forward
her
short
skirts
show
the
neatest
little
boots
she
is
extraordinarily
demure
she
never
cries
joey
reads
with
us
and
points
out
the
jokes
to
vicki
vicki
says
why
did
i
never
tell
her
it
was
so
funny
i
stare
first
at
one
and
then
at
the
other
and
feel
a
hundred
years
old
say
said
joey
coming
into
the
kitchen
just
now
what
said
i
going
to
berlin
for
a
day
you
indeed
the
old
man
will
you
the
who
old
man
i
sha
be
here
for
the
lesson
thank
the
lord
i
off
by
the
first
train
said
i
there
was
a
silence
during
which
joey
fidgeted
about
among
the
culinary
objects
scattered
around
him
i
went
on
peeling
apples
when
he
had
fidgeted
as
much
as
he
wanted
to
be
lit
a
cigarette
said
i
in
kitchens
a
highly
improper
thing
to
do
he
threw
it
into
the
dustbin
say
he
said
again
what
said
i
again
do
you
think
what
do
you
think
he
paused
i
waited
as
he
did
go
on
i
thought
he
had
done
do
i
think
i
said
be
staggered
if
i
told
you
it
such
a
lot
and
it
so
terrific
do
you
think
repeated
joey
taking
no
heed
of
me
but
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
kicking
a
fallen
apple
aimlessly
about
on
the
floor
do
you
think
the
little
girl
like
for
christmas
and
that
do
you
know
i
stopped
peeling
and
gazed
at
him
knife
and
apple
suspended
in
little
girl
i
inquired
you
mean
johanna
joey
stared
then
he
grinned
at
me
monstrously
bet
was
his
cryptic
reply
am
i
to
bet
i
asked
patiently
joey
gave
the
fallen
apple
a
kick
looking
down
i
observed
that
it
was
the
biggest
and
the
best
and
stooped
to
rescue
it
not
pretty
said
i
rebuking
him
kick
even
an
apple
when
it
down
i
say
said
joey
impatiently
be
sensible
there
never
was
any
gettin
much
sense
out
of
you
i
remember
and
you
only
pretendin
you
know
i
mean
vicki
he
had
the
grace
to
blush
fräulein
what
her
name
you
expect
any
one
decent
to
get
the
hang
of
these
names
of
yours
they
ai
got
any
hang
so
how
one
to
get
it
what
she
like
for
christmas
do
you
all
kick
up
a
mighty
fuss
here
over
christmas
trees
and
presents
and
that
plummier
than
we
have
and
mincier
what
you
think
you
will
get
even
one
or
said
i
thoughtfully
peeling
are
gravely
mistaken
the
national
dish
is
carp
boiled
in
beer
joey
looked
really
revolted
he
cried
not
liking
to
credit
his
senses
boiled
in
beer
i
repeated
distinctly
is
what
i
going
to
give
you
on
christmas
day
you
not
he
said
hastily
i
am
i
insisted
before
it
and
after
it
you
will
be
required
in
accordance
with
german
custom
to
sing
chorales
like
to
see
myself
doin
it
you
have
to
sing
alone
invited
to
feed
down
there
and
he
jerked
his
head
toward
that
portion
of
the
kitchen
wall
beyond
which
if
you
passed
through
it
and
the
intervening
and
garden
and
orchard
you
would
come
to
the
dwelling
of
the
lindebergs
said
i
and
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
said
he
trying
to
meet
my
look
with
an
equal
calm
but
conspicuously
failing
bein
so
he
went
on
hurriedly
my
droppin
so
to
speak
into
the
middle
of
somebody
christmas
tree
and
that
it
seems
to
me
only
decent
to
give
the
little
girl
somethin
what
shall
i
get
her
somethin
to
put
on
i
suppose
a
brooch
or
a
pin
what
a
ring
said
i
thoughtfully
peeling
ring
what
can
one
oh
i
say
do
let
waste
time
rottin
and
glancing
up
through
cautious
eyelashes
i
saw
he
was
very
red
be
easy
enough
if
it
was
you
he
said
revengefully
would
on
what
you
like
it
you
want
to
do
the
trick
would
be
a
dictionary
collins
that
unkind
said
i
laying
down
my
knife
he
began
to
grin
again
true
he
insisted
suggests
such
an
immeasurable
stuffiness
i
complained
is
my
fault
said
he
grinning
perhaps
i
deserve
it
because
i
mentioned
a
ring
let
me
tell
you
as
man
to
man
that
you
must
buy
no
brooches
for
vicki
pin
then
pins
necklace
then
of
the
sort
what
would
her
parents
say
give
her
chocolates
a
bunch
of
roses
perhaps
a
book
but
nothing
more
if
you
do
you
get
into
a
nice
scrape
joey
looked
at
me
sort
of
scrape
he
asked
curiously
heavens
do
you
see
are
you
such
a
supreme
goose
my
poor
young
man
the
parents
would
immediately
ask
you
your
intentions
would
they
said
joey
in
his
turn
becoming
thoughtful
and
after
a
moment
he
said
again
would
they
as
certain
as
anything
i
know
said
i
is
it
said
joey
still
thoughtful
a
catastrophe
young
men
very
properly
dread
said
i
do
they
said
joey
sunk
in
thought
if
you
not
listening
and
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
went
on
with
my
peeling
he
pulled
his
cap
out
of
the
pocket
into
which
it
had
been
stuffed
and
began
to
put
it
on
tugging
it
first
over
one
ear
and
then
over
the
other
in
a
deep
abstraction
in
my
kitchen
i
observed
he
said
snatching
it
off
forgot
you
always
make
me
feel
as
if
i
were
out
of
doors
very
odd
said
i
interested
and
slightly
flattered
it
east
wind
you
know
decidedly
breezy
not
to
say
nippin
well
i
must
be
goin
think
so
too
said
i
coldly
be
dull
while
i
away
said
joey
and
departed
with
a
nod
but
he
put
in
his
head
again
the
next
moment
say
miss
schmidt
what
think
i
ought
to
stick
to
chocolates
then
you
do
be
extraordinary
complications
said
i
sure
of
that
swear
it
i
threw
down
my
knife
and
apple
what
the
matter
with
the
boy
i
exclaimed
impatiently
i
ever
swear
if
you
did
you
would
what
a
bit
of
jewelry
would
bring
the
complications
about
dense
dense
dense
of
course
it
would
you
be
surprised
at
the
number
and
size
of
them
you
ca
be
too
careful
give
her
a
joey
gave
a
loud
whoop
it
safe
said
i
severely
it
appeals
to
parents
bet
said
joey
screwing
his
face
into
a
limitlessly
audacious
wink
wish
said
i
very
plaintively
i
knew
exactly
what
it
is
i
am
to
bet
you
constantly
tell
me
to
do
so
but
never
add
the
necessary
directions
i
goin
was
joey
irrelevant
reply
and
his
head
popped
out
as
suddenly
as
it
had
popped
in
or
shall
i
tell
you
i
am
anxious
to
make
this
letter
long
enough
to
please
you
about
frau
von
lindeberg
who
spent
two
days
elaborately
cutting
joey
the
two
first
days
of
his
appearance
in
their
house
as
lodger
persuaded
i
suppose
that
no
one
even
remotely
and
by
business
connected
with
the
schmidts
could
be
anything
but
undesirable
and
how
meeting
him
in
the
passage
or
on
his
way
through
the
garden
to
us
the
iciest
stare
was
all
she
felt
justified
in
giving
him
in
return
for
his
friendly
grin
and
how
on
the
third
day
she
suddenly
melted
and
stopped
and
spoke
pleasantly
to
the
poor
solitary
commiserating
with
his
situation
as
a
stranger
in
a
foreign
country
and
suggesting
the
alleviation
to
his
loneliness
of
frequent
visits
to
them
no
one
knows
the
first
cause
of
this
melting
i
think
she
must
have
heard
through
her
servant
of
the
number
and
texture
of
those
pink
and
blue
silk
handkerchiefs
of
his
amazing
piles
of
new
and
costly
shirts
of
the
obvious
solidity
of
the
silver
on
everything
of
his
that
has
a
back
or
a
stopper
or
a
handle
or
a
knob
anyhow
on
that
third
morning
she
came
up
and
called
on
us
asking
particularly
for
papa
particularly
wished
she
said
to
me
spreading
herself
out
as
she
did
the
last
time
on
the
sofa
see
your
good
father
on
a
matter
of
some
importance
go
and
call
him
said
i
concealing
my
conviction
that
though
i
might
call
he
would
not
come
and
he
would
not
interrupt
my
work
he
cried
the
woman
mad
i
went
back
and
made
excuses
they
were
very
lame
ones
and
frau
von
lindeberg
instantly
brushed
them
aside
will
go
to
him
she
said
getting
up
excellent
father
will
not
refuse
me
i
am
sure
papa
was
sitting
in
his
slippers
before
the
stove
doing
nothing
so
far
as
i
could
see
except
very
comfortably
read
the
new
book
about
goethe
am
sorry
to
disturb
so
busy
a
man
said
frau
von
lindeberg
bearing
down
with
smiles
on
this
picture
of
peace
papa
sprang
up
and
seeing
there
was
no
escape
pretended
to
be
quite
pleased
to
see
her
he
offered
her
his
chair
he
prayed
for
indulgence
toward
his
slippers
and
sitting
down
facing
her
inquired
in
what
way
he
could
be
of
service
want
to
know
something
about
the
young
englishman
who
occupies
a
room
in
our
house
said
frau
von
lindeberg
without
losing
time
understand
that
it
is
not
only
natural
but
incumbent
on
a
parent
to
wish
for
information
in
regard
to
a
person
dwelling
under
the
same
roof
can
give
every
information
said
papa
readily
name
in
english
is
collins
in
german
it
is
really
said
frau
von
lindeberg
taken
aback
is
madam
said
papa
looking
very
pleasant
as
became
a
man
in
his
own
house
confronted
by
a
female
visitor
have
him
and
no
array
of
words
with
which
i
am
acquainted
will
express
the
exactness
of
his
resemblance
to
that
useful
but
unintelligent
beast
really
said
frau
von
lindeberg
not
yet
recovered
ass
madam
is
conspicuous
for
the
narrowness
of
its
understanding
so
is
collins
the
ass
is
exasperating
to
persons
of
normal
brains
so
is
collins
the
ass
is
lazy
in
regard
to
work
and
obstinate
so
is
collins
the
ass
is
totally
indifferent
to
study
so
is
collins
the
ass
has
never
heard
of
goethe
neither
has
collins
the
ass
is
useful
to
the
poor
so
is
collins
the
ass
indeed
is
the
poor
man
most
precious
possession
so
emphatically
is
mr
collins
really
said
frau
von
lindeberg
again
there
anything
more
you
wish
to
know
papa
inquired
politely
for
she
seemed
unable
immediately
to
go
on
she
cleared
her
throat
what
way
in
what
way
is
he
useful
she
asked
he
pays
of
course
of
course
you
can
not
she
smiled
expected
to
teach
him
german
for
nothing
from
doing
that
i
teach
him
german
for
a
great
deal
he
do
you
know
anything
about
his
relations
you
understand
she
added
it
is
not
altogether
pleasant
for
a
private
family
like
ours
to
have
a
strange
young
man
living
under
the
same
roof
cried
papa
understand
it
so
thoroughly
that
i
most
positively
refused
to
have
him
under
this
one
yes
said
frau
von
lindeberg
a
dammerlitz
expression
coming
into
her
face
cases
are
not
are
not
quite
pray
tell
me
who
and
what
is
his
father
respectable
man
madam
i
should
judge
and
besides
respectable
worthy
i
should
say
from
his
letters
yes
and
and
anything
else
too
i
fancy
indeed
i
have
not
a
doubt
he
of
any
family
is
of
his
own
family
madam
yes
and
did
you
did
you
say
he
was
well
off
is
apparently
revoltingly
rich
an
electric
shock
seemed
to
make
frau
von
lindeberg
catch
her
breath
really
she
then
said
evenly
he
inherit
his
wealth
it
madam
he
is
an
ironmonger
another
electric
shock
made
frau
von
lindeberg
catch
her
breath
again
then
she
again
said
really
there
was
a
pause
she
said
after
a
moment
different
from
germany
believe
it
is
admitted
papa
ironmongers
there
may
be
different
from
ironmongers
here
is
at
least
conceivable
me
what
status
has
an
ironmonger
in
england
status
society
that
i
know
not
i
went
over
there
seven
and
twenty
years
ago
for
the
purpose
of
marrying
and
i
met
no
ironmongers
not
consciously
that
is
they
would
they
be
above
the
set
in
which
you
then
found
yourself
or
would
they
she
tried
to
conceal
a
shiver
below
it
know
not
i
know
nothing
of
society
either
there
or
here
but
i
do
know
that
money
there
as
here
is
very
mighty
it
is
i
should
say
merely
a
question
of
having
enough
has
he
enough
man
madam
is
i
believe
perilously
near
becoming
that
miserable
and
isolated
creature
a
millionaire
god
help
the
unfortunate
joey
why
why
should
god
help
him
why
is
he
unfortunate
does
not
he
get
any
share
share
he
gets
it
all
he
is
the
only
child
now
i
put
it
to
you
what
chance
is
there
for
an
unhappy
youth
with
no
i
must
really
go
i
have
taken
up
an
unwarrantable
amount
of
your
time
thank
you
so
very
much
dear
herr
schmidt
no
no
do
not
disturb
yourself
i
beg
your
daughter
will
show
me
the
way
cried
papa
vainly
trying
to
detain
this
determinedly
retreating
figure
his
character
his
morals
we
have
not
yet
touched
yes
so
kind
i
will
not
keep
you
now
another
time
perhaps
and
frau
von
lindeberg
got
herself
out
of
the
room
and
out
of
the
house
scarcely
did
she
say
to
me
in
so
great
and
sudden
a
fever
was
she
to
be
gone
but
she
did
turn
on
the
doorstep
and
give
me
a
curiously
intense
look
it
began
at
my
eyes
travelled
upward
to
my
hair
down
across
my
face
and
from
there
over
my
whole
body
to
my
toes
it
was
a
very
odd
look
it
was
the
most
burningly
critical
look
that
has
ever
shrivelled
my
flesh
now
what
do
you
think
of
this
enormous
long
letter
it
has
made
me
quite
cheerful
just
writing
it
and
i
was
not
very
cheerful
when
i
began
i
hope
the
reading
of
it
will
do
you
as
much
good
write
and
tell
me
you
are
happy
yours
sincerely
schmidt
do
do
try
to
be
happy
lxiii
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
the
house
is
quite
good
enough
for
me
i
assure
you
the
i
think
you
call
it
suggesting
with
pleasant
flattery
that
there
is
something
precious
to
be
set
it
only
has
the
bruised
sort
of
color
you
noticed
when
its
background
is
white
with
snow
in
summer
against
the
green
it
looks
as
white
as
you
please
but
a
thing
must
be
white
indeed
to
look
so
in
the
midst
of
our
present
spotlessness
and
it
is
not
damp
if
there
are
fires
enough
and
the
rooms
are
not
too
small
for
me
poky
was
the
adjective
you
applied
to
the
dear
little
things
and
i
am
never
lonely
and
joey
is
very
nice
even
though
he
does
quite
talk
in
blank
verse
i
feel
a
sort
of
shame
when
you
make
so
much
of
me
when
you
persist
in
telling
me
that
the
outer
conditions
of
my
life
are
unworthy
it
makes
me
feel
so
base
such
a
poor
thing
sometimes
i
half
believe
you
must
be
poking
fun
anyhow
i
do
know
what
you
would
be
at
do
you
wish
me
to
turn
up
my
nose
at
my
surroundings
and
do
you
see
any
good
that
it
would
do
and
the
details
you
go
into
that
you
saw
and
are
so
plaintive
about
came
to
grief
only
the
day
before
your
visit
and
will
in
due
season
be
replaced
by
another
meanwhile
it
does
hurt
coffee
to
be
poured
out
of
a
broken
spout
and
it
does
hurt
us
to
drink
it
after
it
has
passed
through
this
humiliation
on
the
contrary
we
receive
it
thankfully
into
cups
and
remain
perfectly
unruffled
you
say
and
really
you
say
it
in
a
kind
of
agony
that
the
broken
spout
you
are
sure
is
symbolic
of
much
that
is
invisible
in
my
life
you
say
in
effect
though
your
words
are
choicer
that
if
you
had
your
way
my
life
would
be
set
about
with
no
spouts
that
were
not
whole
if
you
had
your
way
anstruther
it
is
a
mercy
that
in
this
one
matter
you
have
not
got
it
what
an
extremely
discontented
creature
i
would
become
if
i
spent
my
days
embedded
in
the
luxury
you
by
a
curious
perverseness
think
should
be
piled
around
me
i
would
gasp
epigrams
from
morning
till
night
i
would
wring
my
hands
and
rend
the
air
with
cries
of
the
broken
spout
is
a
brisk
reminder
of
the
transitoriness
of
and
of
life
it
sets
me
hurrying
about
my
business
which
is
first
to
replace
it
and
then
by
every
possible
ingenuity
to
make
the
most
of
the
passing
moment
the
passing
moment
is
what
you
should
keep
your
eye
on
my
young
friend
it
is
a
slippery
flighty
thing
but
properly
pounced
upon
lends
itself
fruitfully
to
squeezing
the
upshot
of
your
last
letter
is
i
gather
that
for
some
strange
reason
some
extremity
of
perverseness
you
would
have
me
walk
in
silk
attire
and
do
it
in
halls
made
of
marble
it
suffocates
me
only
to
think
of
it
i
love
my
freedom
and
forest
trampings
my
short
skirts
and
swinging
arms
i
want
the
wind
to
blow
on
me
and
the
sun
to
burn
me
and
the
mud
to
spatter
me
away
with
caskets
and
settings
and
frames
i
am
not
a
picture
or
a
jewel
whatever
your
poetic
eye
misled
by
a
sly
and
tricky
muse
persists
in
seeing
it
would
be
quite
a
good
plan
and
of
distinctly
tonic
properties
for
you
to
write
to
frau
von
lindeberg
and
beg
her
to
describe
me
she
it
is
certain
would
do
it
very
accurately
untroubled
by
the
deceptions
of
any
muse
how
kind
of
you
to
ask
me
what
i
would
like
for
christmas
and
how
funny
of
you
to
ask
if
you
might
not
give
me
a
trinket
i
laughed
over
that
for
did
i
not
write
to
you
three
days
ago
and
give
you
an
account
of
my
conversation
with
joey
on
the
subject
of
trinkets
at
christmas
is
it
possible
you
do
not
read
my
letters
is
it
possible
that
having
read
them
you
forget
them
so
immediately
is
it
possible
that
proverbs
lie
and
the
sauce
appropriate
to
the
goose
is
not
also
appropriate
to
the
gander
give
me
a
book
there
is
no
present
i
care
about
but
that
and
if
it
happened
to
be
a
volume
in
the
dark
blue
binding
edition
of
stevenson
to
add
to
my
row
of
him
i
would
be
both
pleased
and
grateful
joey
asked
me
what
i
wanted
so
he
is
getting
me
the
with
a
will
you
give
me
yours
sincerely
schmidt
if
you
rather
you
may
give
me
a
new
instead
later
but
only
an
earthenware
one
like
the
one
that
so
much
upset
you
lxiv
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
we
had
a
most
cheerful
christmas
and
i
hope
you
did
too
i
sent
you
my
blessing
lurking
in
the
pages
of
frenssen
new
and
very
wonderful
book
which
ought
to
have
reached
you
in
time
to
put
under
your
tree
i
hope
you
did
have
a
tree
and
were
properly
festive
the
stevenson
arrived
and
i
found
it
among
my
other
presents
tied
up
by
johanna
with
a
bit
of
scarlet
tape
everything
here
at
christmas
is
tied
up
with
scarlet
or
blue
or
pink
tape
and
your
stevenson
lent
itself
admirably
to
the
treatment
thank
you
very
much
for
it
and
also
for
the
little
coffee
set
i
do
know
whether
i
ought
to
keep
that
it
is
so
very
pretty
and
dainty
and
beyond
my
deserts
but
it
would
break
if
i
packed
it
and
sent
it
back
again
would
it
so
i
will
keep
it
and
drink
your
health
out
of
the
little
cup
with
its
garlands
of
tiny
shepherdesses
the
audacious
joey
did
give
vicki
jewelry
and
a
necklace
if
you
please
the
prettiest
and
obviously
the
costliest
thing
you
can
imagine
what
happened
then
was
in
exact
fulfilment
of
my
prophecy
vicki
gasped
with
joy
and
admiration
he
tells
me
and
before
she
had
well
done
her
gasp
frau
von
lindeberg
with
as
i
gather
a
sort
of
stately
regret
took
the
case
out
of
her
hands
shut
it
with
a
snap
and
returned
it
to
joey
said
frau
von
lindeberg
wrong
with
it
joey
says
he
asked
grand
for
my
little
girl
said
frau
von
lindeberg
are
but
humble
folk
and
she
tossed
her
head
said
joey
dammerlitz
i
muttered
nodding
with
a
complete
comprehension
exclaimed
joey
starting
and
looking
greatly
astonished
on
said
i
i
say
said
joey
in
tones
of
shocked
protest
do
you
say
i
asked
how
you
must
hate
her
said
joey
quite
awestruck
and
staring
at
me
as
though
he
saw
me
for
the
first
time
her
i
asked
surprised
do
you
think
i
hate
her
he
whistled
still
staring
at
me
do
you
think
i
hate
her
i
asked
again
patient
as
i
always
try
to
be
with
him
he
murmured
something
about
as
soon
expecting
it
of
a
bishop
in
my
turn
i
stared
you
go
on
with
the
story
i
said
remembering
the
hopelessness
of
ever
following
the
train
of
thoughts
well
there
appears
to
have
been
a
gloom
after
that
over
the
festivities
you
are
to
understand
that
it
all
took
place
round
the
christmas
tree
in
the
best
parlor
frau
von
lindeberg
in
her
black
silk
and
lace
dress
herr
von
lindeberg
also
in
black
with
his
orders
vicki
in
white
with
blue
ribbons
the
son
come
down
for
the
occasion
in
the
glories
of
his
dragoon
uniform
with
clinking
spurs
and
sword
and
the
servant
starched
and
soaped
in
a
big
embroidered
apron
in
the
middle
of
these
decently
arrayed
rejoicers
the
candles
on
the
tree
lighting
up
every
inch
of
him
stood
joey
in
a
norfolk
jacket
gaiters
and
green
check
tie
was
goin
to
dress
afterward
for
dinner
he
explained
plaintively
how
could
a
man
guess
they
all
have
got
into
their
best
togs
at
four
in
the
afternoon
i
felt
an
awful
fool
i
can
tell
you
expect
you
looked
one
too
said
i
with
cheerful
conviction
there
appears
then
to
have
descended
a
gloom
after
the
necklace
incident
on
the
party
and
a
gloom
of
a
slightly
frosty
nature
vicki
it
is
true
was
rather
melting
than
frosty
her
eyes
full
of
tears
her
handkerchief
often
at
her
nose
but
papa
lindeberg
was
steeped
in
gloom
and
frau
von
lindeberg
was
sad
with
the
impressive
christian
sadness
that
does
not
yet
exclude
an
occasional
wan
smile
as
for
the
son
he
twirled
his
already
much
twirled
mustache
and
stared
very
hard
at
joey
when
the
presents
had
been
given
and
joey
found
himself
staggering
beneath
a
waistcoat
vicki
had
knitted
him
and
a
pair
of
pink
frau
von
lindeberg
had
knitted
him
and
an
empty
photograph
frame
from
papa
lindeberg
and
an
empty
purse
from
the
son
and
a
plate
piled
miscellaneously
with
apples
and
nuts
and
brown
cakes
with
pictures
gummed
on
to
them
he
observed
frau
von
lindeberg
take
her
husband
aside
into
the
remotest
corner
of
the
room
and
there
whisper
with
him
earnestly
and
long
while
she
was
doing
this
the
son
who
knew
no
english
talked
with
an
air
of
one
who
proposed
to
stand
no
nonsense
to
joey
who
knew
no
german
and
vicki
visibly
depressed
slunk
round
the
christmas
tree
blowing
her
nose
papa
lindeberg
says
joey
came
out
of
the
corner
far
more
gloomy
than
he
went
in
he
seemed
like
a
man
urged
on
unwillingly
from
behind
a
man
reluctant
to
advance
and
yet
afraid
or
unable
to
go
back
beg
to
speak
with
you
he
said
to
joey
with
much
military
stiffness
about
his
back
and
heels
was
i
right
i
interrupted
triumphantly
old
beggar
said
joey
looked
frightfully
sick
did
you
said
joey
grinning
young
men
would
have
not
this
one
this
one
went
off
with
him
trippin
on
the
points
of
his
toes
he
felt
so
fit
what
happened
then
i
do
know
he
said
a
lot
of
things
i
could
understand
and
i
do
think
he
could
either
but
he
was
very
game
and
stuck
to
it
once
he
begun
and
went
on
makin
my
head
spin
and
i
daresay
his
own
too
long
and
short
of
it
was
that
in
this
precious
fatherland
of
yours
the
vickis
do
accept
valuables
except
from
those
about
to
become
their
husbands
should
say
that
the
vickis
in
your
own
or
any
other
respectable
fatherland
did
either
said
i
i
not
arguin
am
i
go
on
it
seemed
pretty
queer
to
think
i
was
about
to
become
a
husband
but
there
was
nothin
for
it
the
little
girl
you
see
could
be
done
out
of
her
necklace
just
because
of
that
see
said
i
trying
to
christmas
day
too
day
of
rejoicin
and
that
eh
so
said
i
i
said
i
was
his
man
did
he
understand
he
kept
on
sayin
and
evidently
cursin
the
english
language
in
german
then
i
suggested
that
vicki
should
be
called
in
to
interpret
he
understood
that
for
i
waved
my
arms
about
till
he
did
but
he
said
her
mother
interpreted
better
and
he
would
call
her
instead
i
understood
that
and
said
out
he
did
understand
that
and
while
he
was
tryin
to
i
went
and
told
his
wife
that
he
sent
for
vicki
vicki
came
and
we
got
on
first
rate
first
thing
i
did
was
to
pull
out
the
necklace
and
put
it
round
her
neck
as
paint
ai
she
i
said
to
the
old
man
he
did
understand
that
either
but
vicki
did
and
laughed
give
her
to
me
and
i
give
the
necklace
to
her
see
i
said
shoutin
for
i
felt
if
i
shouted
loud
enough
he
would
be
able
to
help
understandin
however
naturally
german
he
was
him
how
simple
it
is
i
said
to
vicki
vicki
was
very
red
but
awfully
cheerful
and
laughed
all
the
time
she
explained
i
suppose
for
he
went
out
to
call
his
wife
vicki
and
i
stayed
behind
and
well
we
waited
what
did
frau
von
lindeberg
say
she
was
all
right
asked
me
a
lot
about
the
governor
said
ancestors
had
fought
with
the
snake
in
the
garden
of
eden
or
somebody
far
back
like
that
ancient
lineage
you
know
must
be
impressed
i
told
her
i
did
think
my
old
man
would
make
any
serious
objection
to
that
what
she
called
out
looking
quite
scared
they
seem
frightfully
anxious
to
please
the
governor
do
like
ancestors
said
i
got
any
himself
and
do
hold
with
she
pretended
she
was
smilin
and
said
she
supposed
my
father
was
an
original
said
i
goin
strong
for
once
in
the
wit
line
he
not
an
aboriginal
like
vicki
lot
seem
to
have
been
pretty
good
that
eh
seemed
to
stun
then
the
son
came
in
and
shook
both
my
hands
for
about
half
an
hour
and
talked
a
terrific
lot
of
german
and
was
more
pleased
about
it
than
any
one
else
as
far
as
i
could
see
and
then
well
that
about
all
so
i
pulled
off
my
little
game
rather
neatly
what
if
it
was
your
little
game
said
i
with
a
faint
stress
on
the
your
else
should
it
be
he
asked
looking
at
me
is
a
little
darling
was
my
prudent
reply
i
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
really
i
am
more
delighted
about
this
than
i
can
remember
ever
being
about
anything
more
purely
delighted
without
the
least
shadow
on
my
honest
pleasure
and
all
joey
vouchsafed
as
a
reward
for
my
ebullition
of
real
feeling
was
the
information
that
he
considered
me
quite
a
decent
sort
so
you
see
we
are
very
happy
up
on
the
galgenberg
just
now
the
lovers
like
a
pair
of
beaming
babies
frau
von
lindeberg
sobered
by
the
shock
of
her
good
fortune
into
the
gentle
kindliness
that
so
often
follows
in
the
wake
of
a
sudden
great
happiness
papa
lindeberg
warmed
out
of
his
condition
into
much
busy
and
brother
so
uproariously
pleased
that
i
can
only
conclude
him
to
be
the
possessor
of
many
debts
which
he
proposes
to
cause
joey
to
pay
life
is
very
thrilling
when
love
beats
his
wings
so
near
there
has
been
a
great
writing
to
joey
father
and
papa
too
has
written
at
my
dictation
a
letter
rosy
with
the
glow
of
vicki
praises
joey
thinks
his
father
will
shortly
appear
to
inspect
the
lindebergs
he
seems
to
have
no
fears
of
parental
objections
all
right
my
old
man
is
he
says
confidently
when
i
probe
him
on
the
point
adding
just
now
to
this
invariable
reply
look
here
miss
schmidt
vicki
all
right
too
you
see
so
what
the
funk
about
do
know
said
i
and
i
did
even
after
i
had
secretly
looked
in
the
dictionary
for
it
was
empty
of
any
explanation
of
the
word
funk
yours
deeply
interested
in
life
and
lovers
schmidt
lxv
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
my
heartiest
good
wishes
for
the
new
year
may
it
be
fruitful
to
you
in
every
pleasant
way
bring
you
interesting
work
agreeable
companions
bright
days
and
may
it
above
all
things
confirm
and
strengthen
our
friendship
there
now
was
ever
young
man
more
thoroughly
fitted
out
with
invoked
blessings
and
each
one
wished
from
the
inmost
sincerity
of
my
heart
but
we
ca
come
to
berlin
as
you
suggest
we
should
and
allow
ourselves
to
be
shown
round
by
you
must
i
say
thank
you
no
i
think
i
will
i
will
not
pretend
conventionality
with
you
and
i
do
not
thank
you
for
i
do
like
to
have
to
believe
that
you
really
thought
i
would
come
and
then
your
threat
though
it
amused
me
vexed
me
too
you
say
if
i
do
come
you
will
be
forced
to
suppose
that
i
afraid
of
meeting
you
kindly
suppose
anything
you
like
after
that
of
course
i
will
not
come
what
a
boy
you
are
and
what
an
odd
spoilt
boy
why
should
i
be
afraid
of
meeting
you
is
it
you
think
because
once
see
i
am
at
least
not
afraid
of
speaking
of
it
you
passed
across
my
life
convulsively
i
do
know
that
any
man
could
stir
me
up
now
to
even
the
semblance
of
an
earthquake
my
quaking
days
are
done
and
after
that
one
thunderous
upheaval
i
am
fascinated
by
the
charm
of
quiet
weather
and
of
a
placid
basking
in
a
sunshine
i
have
made
with
my
very
own
hands
it
is
useless
for
you
to
tell
me
as
i
know
you
will
that
it
is
only
an
imitation
of
the
real
thing
and
has
no
heat
in
it
i
do
want
to
be
any
hotter
in
this
tempestuous
world
where
everybody
is
so
eager
here
is
at
least
one
woman
who
likes
to
be
cool
and
slow
how
strange
it
is
the
way
you
try
to
alter
me
to
make
me
quite
different
there
seems
to
be
a
perpetual
battering
going
on
at
the
bulwarks
of
my
character
you
want
to
pull
them
down
and
erect
new
fabrics
in
their
place
fabrics
so
frothy
and
unreal
that
they
are
hardly
more
than
fancies
and
would
have
to
be
built
up
afresh
every
day
yet
i
know
you
like
me
and
want
to
be
my
friend
you
make
me
think
of
those
quite
numerous
husbands
who
fall
in
love
with
their
wives
because
they
are
just
what
they
are
and
after
marriage
expend
their
energies
training
them
into
something
absolutely
different
there
was
one
in
jena
while
we
were
there
who
fell
desperately
in
love
with
a
little
girl
of
eighteen
when
he
was
about
your
age
and
he
adored
her
utterly
because
she
was
so
divinely
silly
ignorant
soft
and
babyish
she
knew
nothing
undesirable
and
he
adored
her
for
that
she
knew
nothing
desirable
either
and
he
adored
her
for
that
too
he
adored
her
to
such
an
extent
that
all
jena
not
given
overmuch
to
merriment
was
distorted
with
mirth
at
the
spectacle
he
was
a
clever
man
a
very
promising
professor
yet
he
found
nothing
more
profitable
than
to
spend
every
moment
he
could
spare
adoring
and
his
manner
of
adoring
was
to
sit
earnestly
discovering
by
means
of
repeated
experiment
which
of
his
fingers
fitted
best
into
her
dimples
when
she
laughed
and
twisting
the
tendrils
of
her
hair
round
his
thumbs
in
an
endless
enjoyment
of
the
way
when
he
suddenly
let
them
go
they
beautifully
curled
he
did
this
quite
openly
before
us
all
seeing
i
suppose
no
reason
why
he
should
dissemble
his
interest
in
his
future
wife
dimples
and
curls
but
alas
for
the
dimples
and
curls
once
she
was
married
weh
how
quickly
he
grew
blind
to
them
and
as
for
the
divine
silliness
ignorance
softness
and
babyishness
that
had
so
deeply
fascinated
him
just
those
were
what
got
most
on
to
his
nerves
he
tried
to
do
away
with
them
to
replace
them
by
wit
and
learning
combined
with
brilliant
achievements
among
saucepans
and
shirts
and
the
result
was
disastrous
his
little
wife
was
scared
her
dimples
disappeared
from
want
of
practice
her
pretty
colors
seemed
suddenly
wiped
out
as
though
some
one
had
passed
over
them
roughly
with
a
damp
cloth
her
very
hair
left
off
curling
and
was
as
limp
and
depressed
as
the
rest
of
her
let
this
anstruther
be
an
awful
warning
to
you
not
only
when
you
marry
but
now
at
once
in
regard
to
your
friends
do
not
attempt
to
alter
those
persons
it
is
true
you
would
have
some
difficulty
in
altering
a
person
like
myself
long
ago
petrified
into
her
present
horrid
condition
but
even
the
petrified
can
and
do
get
tired
of
hearing
the
unceasing
knocking
of
the
reforming
mallet
on
their
skulls
leave
me
alone
dear
young
man
like
me
for
anything
you
find
that
can
be
liked
express
proper
indignation
at
the
rest
of
me
and
go
your
way
praising
god
who
made
us
all
really
it
would
be
a
refreshment
if
you
left
off
for
a
space
imploring
me
to
change
into
something
else
there
is
a
ring
about
your
imploring
as
if
you
thought
it
was
mere
wilfulness
holding
me
back
from
being
and
doing
all
you
wish
believe
me
i
am
not
wilful
i
am
only
petrified
i
ca
change
i
have
settled
down
very
comfortably
i
must
say
to
the
preliminary
petrifaction
of
middle
age
and
middle
age
i
begin
to
perceive
is
a
blessed
period
in
which
we
walk
along
mellowly
down
pleasant
slopes
with
nothing
gusty
and
fierce
able
to
pierce
our
incrustation
no
inward
volcanoes
able
to
upset
the
surrounding
rockiness
nothing
to
distract
our
attention
from
the
mild
serenity
of
the
landscape
the
little
flowers
by
the
way
the
beauty
of
the
reddening
leaves
the
calm
and
sunlit
sky
you
will
say
it
is
absurd
at
to
talk
of
middle
age
but
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
anstruther
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
it
is
after
all
simply
a
question
of
bones
yours
are
twenty
years
younger
than
mine
and
did
i
not
always
tell
you
i
was
old
i
am
so
busy
that
you
must
be
extra
pleased
please
to
get
a
letter
today
the
translation
of
papa
book
has
ended
by
interesting
me
to
such
an
extent
that
i
ca
leave
off
working
at
it
i
do
it
officially
in
his
presence
for
an
hour
daily
he
as
full
of
mistrust
of
my
english
as
ever
trying
to
check
it
with
a
dictionary
and
using
picturesque
language
to
convey
his
disgust
to
me
that
he
should
be
so
imperfectly
acquainted
with
a
tongue
so
useful
he
has
forgotten
the
little
he
learned
from
my
mother
in
the
long
years
since
her
death
and
he
has
the
natural
conviction
of
authors
in
the
presence
of
their
translators
that
the
translator
is
a
grossly
uncultured
person
who
will
leave
out
all
the
for
an
hour
i
plod
along
obediently
then
i
pretend
i
must
go
and
cook
what
i
really
do
is
to
run
up
to
my
bedroom
lock
myself
in
and
work
away
feverishly
for
the
rest
of
the
morning
at
my
version
of
the
book
it
is
i
suppose
what
would
be
called
a
free
translation
but
i
protest
i
never
met
anything
quite
so
free
papa
book
is
charming
and
the
charm
can
only
be
reproduced
by
going
repeatedly
wholly
off
the
lines
accordingly
i
go
and
find
the
process
exhilarating
and
amusing
the
thing
amuses
and
interests
me
i
wonder
if
it
would
amuse
and
interest
other
people
i
fear
it
would
not
for
when
i
try
to
imagine
it
being
read
by
my
various
acquaintances
my
heart
sinks
with
the
weight
of
the
certainty
that
it
could
possibly
i
imagine
it
in
the
hands
of
joey
of
frau
von
lindeberg
of
different
people
in
jena
and
the
expression
my
inner
eye
sees
on
their
faces
makes
me
unable
for
a
long
while
to
go
on
with
it
then
i
get
over
that
and
begin
working
again
at
my
salad
it
really
is
a
salad
with
papa
as
the
groundwork
of
lettuce
very
crisp
and
fresh
and
myself
as
the
dressing
and
bits
of
garnishing
beetroot
and
egg
i
work
at
it
half
the
night
sometimes
so
eager
am
i
to
get
it
done
and
sent
off
yes
my
young
friend
i
have
inherited
papa
boldness
in
the
matter
of
sending
off
and
the
most
impressive
of
london
publishers
is
shortly
to
hold
it
in
his
sacred
hands
and
if
his
sacred
hands
forget
themselves
so
far
as
to
hurl
it
rudely
back
at
me
they
yet
can
never
take
away
the
fun
i
have
had
writing
it
yours
sincerely
schmidt
joey
father
is
expected
and
the
whole
galgenberg
is
foggy
with
the
fumes
of
cooking
once
his
consent
is
given
the
engagement
will
be
put
in
the
papers
and
life
will
grow
busy
and
brilliant
for
frau
von
lindeberg
she
talks
of
removing
immediately
to
berlin
there
to
give
a
series
of
crushingly
parties
to
those
of
her
friends
who
are
supposed
to
have
laughed
when
vicki
was
thrown
over
by
her
first
lover
i
do
believe
they
did
laugh
i
refuse
to
believe
in
such
barbarians
but
frau
von
lindeberg
grown
frank
about
that
disastrous
story
now
that
it
has
been
so
handsomely
wiped
off
vicki
little
slate
assures
me
that
they
did
she
does
seem
angry
any
longer
about
it
being
much
too
happy
to
have
room
in
her
heart
for
wrath
but
she
is
bent
on
this
one
form
of
revenge
well
it
is
a
form
that
will
gratify
everybody
revenger
and
revengee
equally
i
should
think
lxvi
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
i
could
write
before
i
been
too
busy
the
manuscript
went
this
morning
after
real
hard
work
day
and
night
and
now
i
feel
like
a
squeezed
lemon
that
yet
is
cheerful
if
you
can
conceive
such
a
thing
joey
father
has
been
and
gone
he
arrived
late
one
night
inspected
the
lindebergs
gave
his
consent
and
was
off
hours
later
the
lindebergs
were
much
disconcerted
by
these
quick
methods
they
who
like
to
move
slowly
think
slowly
and
sit
hours
over
each
meal
and
they
had
not
said
half
they
wanted
to
say
and
he
had
not
eaten
half
he
was
intended
to
eat
before
he
was
gone
also
he
disconcerted
them
indeed
it
was
more
than
that
he
upset
them
utterly
by
not
looking
like
what
they
had
made
up
their
minds
he
would
look
like
the
galgenbergs
expected
to
see
some
one
who
should
be
blatantly
rich
and
blatant
riches
it
dimly
felt
would
be
expressed
by
much
flesh
and
a
thick
watch
chain
instead
the
man
had
a
head
like
julius
cæsar
lean
thoughtful
shrewd
and
a
spare
body
that
made
papa
lindeberg
seem
strangely
pulpy
and
as
if
it
were
held
together
only
by
the
buttons
of
his
clothes
we
were
staggered
frau
von
lindeberg
could
understand
why
a
man
so
rich
should
also
be
so
thin
he
is
in
a
position
to
have
the
costliest
cooking
she
said
several
times
looking
at
me
with
amazed
eyebrows
nor
could
she
understand
why
a
man
without
ancestors
should
yet
make
her
husband
whose
past
bristles
with
them
be
the
one
to
look
as
if
he
had
got
any
she
mused
much
and
aloud
while
vicki
was
being
run
breathlessly
over
the
mountains
by
her
nimble
future
with
joey
devoured
by
pride
in
them
both
in
attendance
i
went
down
to
ask
if
i
could
help
in
the
cooking
and
found
her
going
about
her
kitchen
like
one
in
a
dream
she
let
me
tuck
up
my
sleeves
and
help
her
and
while
i
did
it
she
gave
vent
to
many
musings
about
england
and
its
curious
children
strange
people
she
kept
on
saying
helplessly
but
she
is
the
happiest
woman
in
germany
at
this
moment
happier
far
than
vicki
for
she
sees
with
her
older
eyes
the
immense
advantages
that
are
to
be
vicki
who
sees
at
present
nothing
at
all
but
joey
and
then
the
deliciousness
of
being
able
to
write
to
all
those
relations
grown
of
late
so
supercilious
to
cousin
mienchen
who
came
and
played
the
rich
and
tell
them
the
glorious
news
vicki
basks
in
the
sunshine
of
a
mother
love
again
and
never
hears
a
cross
word
good
things
are
showered
down
on
her
presents
pettings
admiration
all
those
charming
things
that
every
girl
should
enjoy
once
before
her
pretty
girlhood
has
gone
it
is
the
most
delightful
experience
to
see
a
family
in
the
very
act
of
receiving
a
stroke
of
luck
strokes
of
luck
especially
of
these
dimensions
are
so
very
rare
it
is
like
being
present
at
a
pantomime
that
does
leave
off
and
watching
the
good
fairy
touching
one
gray
dull
unhappy
thing
after
another
into
radiance
and
smiles
but
i
lose
my
friends
for
they
go
to
berlin
almost
immediately
and
from
there
to
manchester
on
a
visit
to
collins
a
visit
during
which
the
business
part
of
the
marriage
is
to
be
settled
also
and
naturally
we
lose
joey
this
is
rather
a
blow
just
as
we
had
begun
so
pleasantly
to
roll
in
his
money
but
where
vicki
goes
he
goes
too
and
so
papa
and
i
will
soon
be
left
again
alone
on
our
mountain
face
to
face
with
vegetarian
economies
well
it
has
been
a
pleasant
interlude
and
i
who
first
saw
vicki
steeped
in
despair
piteous
slighted
talked
about
shall
see
her
at
last
departing
down
the
hill
arrayed
in
glory
as
with
a
garment
then
i
shall
turn
back
when
the
last
whisk
of
her
shining
skirts
has
gleamed
round
the
bend
of
the
road
to
my
own
business
to
the
sober
trudging
along
the
row
of
days
allotted
me
to
the
making
of
economies
the
reading
of
good
books
the
practice
of
abstract
excellences
the
pruning
of
my
soul
my
soul
i
must
say
has
had
some
vigorous
prunings
it
ought
by
now
to
be
of
an
admirable
sturdiness
you
yourself
once
lopped
off
a
most
luxuriant
growth
that
was
i
agree
best
away
and
now
these
buds
of
friendship
of
easier
circumstances
are
going
to
be
nipped
off
too
and
when
they
are
gone
what
will
be
left
i
wonder
but
the
uncompromising
and
the
rugged
is
it
possible
i
am
so
base
as
to
be
envious
in
spite
of
my
real
pleasure
i
ca
shut
out
a
certain
wistfulness
a
certain
little
pang
and
exactly
what
kind
of
wistfulness
it
is
and
exactly
what
kind
of
pang
i
do
well
know
unless
it
is
envy
vicki
lot
is
the
last
one
i
would
choose
yet
it
makes
me
wistful
it
includes
joey
yet
i
feel
a
little
pang
this
is
very
odd
for
joey
as
a
husband
a
person
from
whom
you
can
not
get
away
would
be
rather
more
than
i
could
suffer
with
any
show
of
gladness
how
then
can
i
be
envious
of
course
if
joey
knew
what
i
am
writing
he
would
thrust
an
incredulous
tongue
in
his
cheek
wink
a
sceptical
eye
and
mutter
some
eternal
truth
about
grapes
but
i
on
the
other
hand
would
watch
him
doing
it
with
the
perfect
calm
of
him
who
sticks
unshakably
to
his
point
what
would
his
cheek
his
tongue
and
his
winking
eye
be
to
me
they
would
leave
me
wholly
unmoved
not
a
hair
breadth
moved
from
my
original
point
which
is
that
joey
is
not
a
person
you
can
marry
but
certainly
it
is
a
good
and
delightful
thing
that
vicki
thinks
he
is
and
thinks
it
with
such
conviction
i
tell
you
the
top
of
our
mountain
is
in
a
perpetual
rosy
glow
nowadays
as
though
the
sun
never
left
it
and
the
entire
phenomenon
is
due
solely
to
these
two
joyful
young
persons
yours
sincerely
schmidt
lxvii
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
i
did
a
silly
thing
today
i
went
and
mourned
in
an
empty
house
i
do
think
i
generally
morbid
but
today
i
indulged
in
a
perfect
orgy
of
morbidness
write
and
scold
me
it
is
your
turn
to
scold
and
by
doing
it
thoroughly
you
will
bring
me
back
to
my
ordinary
cheerful
state
the
lindebergs
are
gone
and
i
am
feeling
it
absurdly
i
did
realize
how
much
i
loved
that
little
dear
vicki
nor
in
the
least
the
interest
frau
von
lindeberg
presence
and
doings
gave
life
the
last
three
weeks
have
been
so
thrilling
there
was
so
much
warmth
and
brightness
going
about
that
it
reached
even
onlookers
like
myself
and
warmed
and
lighted
them
and
now
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
it
is
gone
gone
wiped
out
snuffed
out
and
papa
and
i
are
alone
again
and
there
is
a
northeast
wind
these
are
the
times
when
philosophy
is
so
useful
but
do
explain
why
it
is
that
one
is
only
a
philosopher
so
long
as
one
is
happy
when
i
am
contented
and
everything
is
just
as
i
like
it
i
can
philosophize
beautifully
and
do
it
with
a
hearty
sincerity
that
convinces
both
myself
and
the
person
listening
to
me
but
when
the
bad
days
come
the
empty
days
the
disappointing
chilly
days
behold
philosophy
that
serene
and
dignified
companion
so
long
as
the
weather
was
fine
clutching
her
academic
skirts
hastily
together
and
indulging
in
the
form
of
rapid
retreat
known
to
the
vulgar
and
the
graphic
as
skedaddling
not
all
charms
fly
your
keats
inquires
the
mere
touch
of
cold
philosophy
but
i
have
found
that
nothing
flies
quite
so
fast
as
cold
philosophy
herself
she
would
win
in
any
race
when
the
race
is
who
shall
run
away
quickest
she
is
of
no
use
whatever
it
is
my
deliberate
conclusion
except
to
sit
with
in
the
sun
on
the
south
side
of
a
sheltering
wall
on
those
calm
afternoons
of
life
when
you
only
got
to
open
your
mouth
and
ripe
peaches
drop
into
it
i
used
to
think
if
i
could
love
her
enough
she
would
in
her
gratitude
chloroform
me
safely
over
all
the
less
pleasant
portions
of
life
see
to
it
that
i
was
unconscious
during
the
passage
never
let
me
be
aware
of
anything
but
the
beautiful
and
the
good
but
either
she
has
no
gratitude
or
i
have
little
love
and
the
years
have
brought
me
the
one
conviction
that
she
is
an
artist
at
leaving
you
in
the
lurch
the
world
is
strewn
with
persons
she
has
left
in
it
and
out
of
the
three
inhabitants
of
a
mountain
to
leave
one
there
is
surely
an
enormous
percentage
now
what
is
your
opinion
of
a
woman
with
a
healthy
body
a
warm
room
and
a
sufficient
dinner
who
feels
as
though
the
soul
within
her
were
an
echoing
cavern
empty
cold
and
dark
it
is
what
i
feel
at
this
moment
and
it
is
shameful
is
it
shameful
that
the
sight
of
leaden
clouds
but
they
really
are
dreadful
clouds
inky
ragged
harassed
scudding
across
the
sky
and
of
furious
brown
on
the
little
trees
in
front
of
the
lindebergs
deserted
house
being
lashed
and
maddened
by
the
wind
should
make
me
suddenly
catch
my
breath
for
pain
it
is
pain
quite
sharp
unmistakable
pain
and
it
is
because
i
am
alone
and
my
friends
gone
and
the
dusk
is
falling
this
afternoon
i
leaned
against
their
gate
and
really
suffered
regret
for
the
past
fear
for
the
future
vague
rather
terrifying
fears
not
wholly
unconnected
with
you
hurt
so
much
that
they
positively
succeeded
in
wringing
a
tear
out
of
me
it
was
a
very
reluctant
tear
and
only
came
out
after
a
world
of
wringing
and
i
had
stood
there
a
most
morbid
long
time
before
it
appeared
but
it
did
appear
and
the
vicious
wind
screamed
round
the
lindebergs
blank
house
rattled
its
staring
naked
windows
banged
in
wild
gusts
about
the
road
where
the
puddles
of
half
melted
snow
reflected
the
blackness
of
the
sky
tore
at
my
hair
and
dress
stung
my
cheeks
shook
the
gate
i
held
on
to
thundered
over
the
hills
dear
young
man
i
do
want
to
afflict
you
with
these
tales
of
woe
and
weakness
but
i
must
tell
you
what
i
did
next
i
went
up
and
got
the
key
from
johanna
in
whose
keeping
frau
von
lindeberg
had
left
it
and
came
down
again
and
unlocked
the
door
of
the
house
lately
so
full
of
light
and
life
and
crept
fearfully
about
the
echoing
rooms
and
up
the
dismal
stairs
and
let
myself
go
as
i
tell
you
to
a
very
orgy
of
morbidness
it
was
like
a
nightmare
memories
took
the
form
of
ghosts
and
clutched
at
me
through
the
balusters
and
from
behind
doors
with
thin
cold
fingers
and
the
happiest
memories
were
those
that
clutched
the
coldest
i
fled
at
last
in
a
sudden
panic
flying
out
of
reach
of
them
slamming
the
door
to
running
for
my
life
up
the
road
and
in
at
our
gate
johanna
did
not
let
me
in
at
once
and
i
banged
with
my
fists
in
a
frenzy
to
get
away
from
the
black
sky
and
the
threatening
thunder
of
the
pines
said
johanna
when
she
saw
me
so
that
i
must
have
looked
rather
wild
well
i
am
weak
you
see
just
as
weak
and
silly
as
the
very
weakest
and
silliest
in
spite
of
my
big
words
and
brave
face
i
am
writing
now
as
near
the
stove
as
possible
in
papa
room
glad
to
be
with
him
glad
to
be
warm
grateful
to
sit
with
somebody
alive
after
that
hour
with
the
ghosts
and
the
result
of
deep
considering
has
been
to
force
me
to
face
the
fact
that
there
is
much
meanness
in
my
nature
there
is
bother
to
contradict
there
is
all
my
forlornness
since
yesterday
is
simply
the
outcome
of
a
mixture
of
envy
and
i
do
miss
dear
vicki
whom
i
greatly
loved
i
do
miss
the
cheery
joey
i
miss
papa
lindeberg
who
likened
me
to
hebe
i
miss
his
wife
who
kept
me
in
my
proper
place
it
is
quite
true
that
i
miss
these
people
but
that
would
never
of
itself
be
a
feeling
strong
enough
to
sweep
me
off
my
feet
into
black
pools
of
misery
as
i
was
swept
this
afternoon
and
never
never
would
make
me
who
have
so
fine
a
contempt
for
easy
tears
cry
no
anstruther
bitter
truths
once
seen
have
to
be
stared
at
squarely
and
i
am
simply
comparing
my
lot
with
vicki
and
being
sorry
for
myself
it
is
amazing
that
it
should
be
so
for
have
i
not
everything
a
reasonable
being
needs
and
am
i
not
then
a
reasonable
being
and
the
meanness
of
it
for
it
does
imply
a
grudging
an
uneasiness
in
the
presence
of
somebody
else
happiness
well
i
thoroughly
ashamed
and
that
at
least
is
a
good
thing
and
now
that
you
know
how
badly
i
too
need
lecturing
and
how
i
am
torn
by
particularly
ungenerous
emotions
perhaps
you
see
what
a
worthless
person
i
am
and
will
take
me
down
from
the
absurd
high
pinnacle
on
which
you
persist
in
keeping
me
and
on
which
i
have
felt
so
desperately
uncomfortable
for
months
past
it
is
infinitely
humiliating
i
do
assure
you
to
be
shall
we
say
venerated
for
excellences
one
would
like
to
possess
but
is
most
keenly
aware
one
does
not
persons
with
any
tendency
to
be
honest
about
themselves
and
with
even
the
smallest
grain
of
a
sense
of
humor
should
never
be
chosen
as
idols
and
set
up
aloft
in
giddy
places
they
make
shockingly
bad
idols
they
are
divided
by
a
desire
to
laugh
and
an
immense
pity
for
the
venerator
i
add
these
observations
dear
friend
to
the
description
of
my
real
nature
that
has
gone
before
because
your
letters
are
turning
more
and
more
into
the
sort
of
letters
that
ends
a
placid
friendship
i
want
to
be
placid
i
love
being
placid
i
insist
on
being
placid
and
the
thought
of
your
letters
with
so
little
placidness
about
them
was
with
me
this
afternoon
in
that
terrible
house
and
it
added
to
the
fear
of
the
future
that
seized
me
by
the
throat
and
would
not
let
me
go
is
it
then
so
impossible
to
be
friends
just
friends
with
a
man
in
the
same
dear
frank
way
one
is
with
another
woman
or
a
man
is
with
a
man
i
hoped
you
and
i
were
going
to
prove
the
possibility
triumphantly
i
even
so
keenly
do
i
desire
it
prayed
that
we
were
but
perhaps
there
is
little
use
in
such
praying
yours
sincerely
schmidt
you
may
scold
me
as
much
as
you
like
but
you
are
not
to
comfort
me
do
not
make
the
mistake
i
earnestly
beg
you
of
supposing
that
i
want
to
be
comforted
lxviii
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
just
a
line
to
tell
you
that
i
have
recovered
and
you
are
not
to
take
my
letter
yesterday
too
seriously
i
woke
up
this
morning
perfectly
normal
and
able
to
look
out
on
the
day
before
me
with
the
usual
interest
then
something
very
nice
happened
my
translation
of
papa
book
did
come
back
but
instead
arrived
an
urbane
letter
expressing
a
kind
of
reluctant
willingness
if
you
can
imagine
the
mixture
to
publish
it
what
do
you
think
of
that
the
letter
it
is
true
goes
on
to
suggest
still
with
urbanity
that
no
doubt
no
one
will
ever
buy
it
but
promises
if
ever
any
one
does
to
send
us
a
certain
just
portion
of
what
was
paid
for
it
said
papa
when
his
first
delight
had
calmed
unerring
instinct
with
which
the
english
very
properly
called
a
nation
of
shopkeepers
instantly
recognize
the
value
of
a
good
thing
when
they
see
it
consider
the
long
years
during
which
i
have
vainly
beaten
at
the
doors
of
the
german
public
and
compare
its
deafness
with
the
quick
response
of
our
alert
and
admirable
cousins
across
the
channel
well
do
i
know
which
was
the
part
that
specially
appealed
to
this
man
business
instinct
and
he
mentioned
while
my
guilty
ears
burned
crimson
a
chapter
of
statistics
the
whole
of
which
i
had
left
out
yours
sincerely
schmidt
lxix
galgenberg
dear
anstruther
i
see
no
use
whatever
in
a
friend
if
one
can
not
tell
him
about
one
times
of
gloom
without
his
immediately
proposing
to
do
the
very
thing
one
does
want
him
to
do
which
is
to
pay
one
a
call
your
telegram
has
upset
me
you
see
into
a
reckless
use
of
the
word
one
a
word
i
spend
hours
sometimes
endeavoring
to
circumvent
and
which
i
do
circumvent
if
i
am
in
good
bodily
and
spiritual
health
but
the
moment
my
vitality
is
lowered
as
it
is
now
by
your
telegram
i
cease
to
be
either
strong
enough
or
artful
enough
to
dodge
it
there
are
four
of
it
in
that
sentence
i
fling
them
to
you
in
a
handful
only
remarking
that
they
are
your
fault
not
mine
now
listen
to
me
i
will
drop
this
playfulness
which
i
do
in
the
least
feel
and
be
serious
why
do
you
want
to
come
and
as
you
telegraph
talk
things
over
i
do
want
to
talk
things
over
it
is
a
fatal
thing
to
do
may
i
not
tell
you
frankly
of
my
moods
of
my
downs
as
well
as
of
my
ups
without
at
once
setting
you
off
in
the
direction
of
too
much
kindness
after
i
had
written
that
letter
i
was
afraid
and
i
opened
it
again
to
tell
you
it
was
not
your
comfortings
and
pityings
that
i
wanted
but
the
sterner
remedy
of
a
good
scolding
yet
your
answer
is
a
telegram
to
ask
if
you
may
come
of
course
i
telegraphed
back
that
i
should
not
be
here
it
is
quite
true
i
should
not
if
you
came
i
will
not
see
you
nothing
can
be
gained
by
it
and
everything
might
be
lost
oh
everything
everything
might
be
lost
i
would
see
to
it
that
you
did
not
find
me
the
forests
are
big
and
i
can
walk
if
needs
be
for
hours
you
will
think
me
quite
savagely
unkind
but
i
help
that
perhaps
if
your
letters
lately
had
been
different
i
would
not
so
obstinately
refuse
to
see
you
but
i
have
a
wretched
feeling
that
my
poor
soul
is
going
to
be
pruned
again
pruned
of
its
last
most
pleasant
growth
and
you
are
on
the
road
to
saying
and
doing
things
we
shall
both
be
for
ever
sorry
for
i
have
tried
my
best
to
stop
you
to
pull
you
up
and
i
hope
with
all
my
heart
that
i
may
not
be
going
to
get
a
letter
that
will
spoil
things
irreparably
have
not
my
hints
been
big
enough
let
me
beg
you
not
to
write
foolishnesses
that
can
not
once
sent
be
got
back
again
and
burned
but
at
least
when
you
sit
down
to
write
you
can
consider
your
words
and
those
that
have
come
out
too
impulsively
can
go
into
the
fire
while
if
you
came
here
what
would
you
do
with
your
tongue
i
wonder
there
is
no
means
of
stopping
that
once
it
is
well
started
and
the
smallest
things
sets
it
off
in
terrible
directions
am
i
not
your
friend
will
you
not
spare
me
must
i
be
forced
to
speak
with
a
plainness
that
will
by
comparison
make
all
my
previous
plainness
seem
the
very
essence
of
polite
artificialness
of
all
the
wise
counsel
any
one
could
offer
you
at
this
moment
there
is
none
half
so
wise
none
that
taken
would
be
half
so
precious
to
us
both
as
the
counsel
to
leave
well
alone
i
offer
it
you
earnestly
oh
more
than
earnestly
with
a
passionate
anxiety
lest
you
should
refuse
it
your
sincere
friend
schmidt
i
suppose
it
is
true
what
i
have
often
suspected
that
i
am
a
person
doomed
to
lose
one
by
one
the
things
that
have
been
most
dear
to
me
lxx
well
there
is
no
help
then
you
will
do
it
you
will
put
an
end
to
it
you
have
written
me
a
the
thing
i
have
been
trying
so
hard
for
so
long
to
stop
your
doing
and
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
drop
into
silence
lxxi
but
what
is
there
possible
except
silence
i
will
not
marry
you
i
can
not
after
this
keep
you
my
friend
lxxii
oh
i
have
tried
i
have
hoped
to
keep
you
it
has
been
so
sweet
to
me
it
has
made
everything
so
different
for
the
second
time
you
have
wiped
the
brightness
out
of
my
life
lxxiii
leave
me
alone
do
torment
me
with
wild
letters
i
do
not
love
you
i
will
not
marry
you
i
cared
for
you
sincerely
as
a
friend
but
what
a
gulf
there
is
between
that
and
the
abandonment
of
worship
last
year
in
jena
only
just
that
just
that
breathless
passion
would
make
me
marry
and
i
would
never
feel
it
for
a
man
i
am
forced
to
pity
is
not
worship
a
looking
up
a
rapture
of
faith
i
can
not
look
up
to
you
i
have
no
faith
in
you
leave
me
alone
lxxiv
let
us
consider
the
thing
calmly
let
us
try
to
say
without
too
great
a
clamor
what
is
the
use
after
all
of
being
so
vocal
we
have
each
given
the
other
many
hours
of
pleasure
and
shall
we
not
be
grateful
rather
than
tragic
here
we
are
got
at
last
to
the
point
where
we
face
the
inevitable
and
we
may
as
well
do
it
decently
see
here
is
a
woman
who
does
not
love
you
would
you
have
her
marry
you
when
she
had
rather
not
and
you
must
be
angry
with
me
because
i
do
love
you
for
how
can
i
help
it
so
far
am
i
from
the
least
approach
to
it
that
it
makes
me
tired
just
to
think
of
a
thing
so
strenuous
of
the
bother
of
it
of
the
perpetual
condition
of
mind
and
body
to
a
pitch
above
the
normal
the
normal
is
what
i
want
my
heart
is
set
upon
it
i
do
want
ecstasies
i
do
want
excitement
i
do
want
alternations
of
bliss
and
terror
i
want
to
be
that
peaceful
individual
a
maiden
lady
a
maiden
lady
looking
after
her
aged
father
tending
her
flowers
fondling
her
bees
no
i
do
think
she
could
fondle
bees
fondling
a
cat
then
which
i
have
yet
got
oh
i
know
i
have
moods
of
a
more
tempestuous
nature
such
as
the
one
i
was
foolish
enough
to
write
to
you
about
the
other
day
stirring
you
up
to
a
still
more
violent
tempestuousness
yourself
but
they
roll
away
again
when
they
have
growled
themselves
out
and
the
mood
that
succeeds
them
is
like
clear
shining
after
rain
i
intend
this
clear
shining
as
i
grow
older
to
be
more
and
more
my
surrounding
atmosphere
i
make
the
bravest
resolutions
will
you
not
make
some
too
dear
late
friend
and
sometime
lover
do
not
want
me
to
give
you
what
i
have
not
got
we
are
both
suffering
just
now
but
what
about
time
that
kindest
soother
softener
healer
that
final
tidier
up
of
ragged
edges
and
sweeper
away
of
the
broken
fragments
of
the
past
lxxv
i
tell
you
you
have
taken
away
what
i
held
precious
for
the
second
time
and
there
shall
be
no
third
you
showed
me
once
that
you
could
not
be
a
faithful
lover
you
have
shown
me
now
you
can
not
be
a
faithful
friend
i
am
not
an
easy
woman
who
can
be
made
much
of
and
dropped
in
an
unending
even
if
i
loved
you
we
would
be
most
wretched
married
you
with
the
feeling
that
i
did
not
fit
into
your
set
i
with
the
knowledge
that
you
felt
so
besides
the
deadly
fear
of
you
of
your
changes
and
fits
of
hot
and
cold
but
i
do
not
love
you
this
is
what
you
seem
unable
to
realize
yet
it
is
true
and
it
settles
everything
for
ever
lxxvi
must
there
be
so
much
explaining
it
was
because
i
thought
i
was
making
amends
that
way
for
having
though
unconsciously
led
you
to
fancy
you
cared
for
me
last
year
i
wanted
to
be
of
some
use
to
you
and
i
saw
how
much
you
liked
to
get
them
by
gradual
degrees
as
we
both
grew
wiser
i
meant
my
letters
to
be
a
help
to
you
who
have
no
sister
no
mother
and
a
father
you
do
speak
to
i
was
going
to
be
the
person
to
whom
you
could
tell
everything
on
whose
devotion
and
sincerity
you
could
always
count
it
was
to
have
been
a
thing
so
honest
so
frank
so
clear
so
affectionate
and
i
not
even
had
time
really
to
begin
for
at
first
there
was
my
own
struggling
to
get
out
of
the
deep
waters
where
i
was
drowning
and
afterward
it
seemed
to
be
nothing
but
a
staving
off
a
writing
about
other
things
a
determined
telling
of
little
anecdotes
of
talk
about
our
neighbors
about
people
you
do
know
about
anything
rather
than
your
soul
and
my
soul
each
time
i
talked
of
those
in
moments
of
greater
stress
when
the
longing
for
a
real
friend
to
whom
i
could
write
openly
was
stronger
than
i
could
resist
there
came
a
letter
back
that
made
my
heart
stand
still
i
had
lost
my
lover
and
it
seemed
as
if
i
must
lose
my
friend
at
first
i
believed
that
you
would
settle
down
i
thought
it
could
only
be
a
question
of
patience
but
you
could
not
wait
you
could
not
believe
you
were
not
going
to
be
given
what
you
wanted
in
exactly
the
way
you
wanted
it
and
you
have
killed
the
poor
goose
after
all
the
goose
i
have
watched
so
anxiously
who
was
going
to
lay
us
such
beautiful
golden
eggs
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
i
know
the
horrors
of
loving
somebody
who
does
love
you
and
it
is
terrible
for
us
both
that
you
should
not
understand
me
to
the
point
as
you
say
of
not
being
able
to
believe
me
i
have
not
always
understood
myself
but
here
everything
seems
so
plain
love
is
not
a
thing
you
can
pick
up
and
throw
into
the
gutter
and
pick
up
again
as
the
fancy
takes
you
i
am
a
person
very
unfortunately
for
you
with
a
quite
peculiar
dread
of
thrusting
myself
or
my
affections
on
any
one
of
in
any
way
outstaying
my
welcome
the
man
i
would
love
would
be
the
man
i
could
trust
to
love
me
for
ever
i
do
not
trust
you
i
did
outstay
my
welcome
once
i
did
get
thrown
into
the
gutter
and
came
near
drowning
in
that
sordid
place
oh
call
me
hard
wickedly
revengeful
unbelievably
cruel
if
it
makes
you
feel
less
miserable
but
will
you
listen
to
a
last
prophecy
you
will
get
over
this
as
surely
as
you
have
got
over
your
other
similar
vexations
and
you
will
live
to
say
god
that
german
girl
what
was
her
name
was
it
schmidt
good
heavens
yes
thank
god
she
was
so
foolish
as
not
to
take
advantage
of
an
unaccountable
but
strictly
temporary
madness
and
if
i
am
bitter
forgive
me
lxxvii
it
would
be
useless
lxxviii
i
would
not
see
you
lxxix
i
do
not
love
you
lxxx
i
will
never
marry
you
lxxxi
i
shall
not
write
again
the
end
