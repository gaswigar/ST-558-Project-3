preface
in
this
concluding
part
of
golden
i
have
discussed
the
problem
which
gives
its
title
to
the
whole
work
if
i
am
right
the
golden
bough
over
which
the
king
of
the
wood
diana
s
priest
at
aricia
kept
watch
and
ward
was
no
other
than
a
branch
of
mistletoe
growing
on
an
oak
within
the
sacred
grove
and
as
the
plucking
of
the
bough
was
a
necessary
prelude
to
the
slaughter
of
the
priest
i
have
been
led
to
institute
a
parallel
between
the
king
of
the
wood
at
nemi
and
the
norse
god
balder
who
was
worshipped
in
a
sacred
grove
beside
the
beautiful
sogne
fiord
of
norway
and
was
said
to
have
perished
by
a
stroke
of
mistletoe
which
alone
of
all
things
on
earth
or
in
heaven
could
wound
him
on
the
theory
here
suggested
both
balder
and
the
king
of
the
wood
personified
in
a
sense
the
sacred
oak
of
our
aryan
forefathers
and
both
had
deposited
their
lives
or
souls
for
safety
in
the
parasite
which
sometimes
though
rarely
is
found
growing
on
an
oak
and
by
the
very
rarity
of
its
appearance
excites
the
wonder
and
stimulates
the
devotion
of
ignorant
men
though
i
am
now
less
than
ever
disposed
to
lay
weight
on
the
analogy
between
the
italian
priest
and
the
norse
god
i
have
allowed
it
to
stand
because
it
furnishes
me
with
a
pretext
for
discussing
not
only
the
general
question
of
the
external
soul
in
popular
superstition
but
also
the
of
europe
since
fire
played
a
part
both
in
the
myth
of
balder
and
in
the
ritual
of
the
arician
grove
thus
balder
the
beautiful
in
my
hands
is
little
more
than
a
to
carry
two
heavy
of
facts
and
what
is
true
of
balder
applies
equally
to
the
priest
of
nemi
himself
the
nominal
hero
of
the
long
tragedy
of
human
folly
and
suffering
which
has
unrolled
itself
before
the
readers
of
these
volumes
and
on
which
the
curtain
is
now
about
to
fall
he
too
for
all
the
quaint
garb
he
wears
and
the
gravity
with
which
he
stalks
across
the
stage
is
merely
a
puppet
and
it
is
time
to
unmask
him
before
laying
him
up
in
the
box
to
drop
metaphor
while
nominally
investigating
a
particular
problem
of
ancient
mythology
i
have
really
been
discussing
questions
of
more
general
interest
which
concern
the
gradual
evolution
of
human
thought
from
savagery
to
civilization
the
enquiry
is
beset
with
difficulties
of
many
kinds
for
the
record
of
man
s
mental
development
is
even
more
imperfect
than
the
record
of
his
physical
development
and
it
is
harder
to
read
not
only
by
reason
of
the
incomparably
more
subtle
and
complex
nature
of
the
subject
but
because
the
reader
s
eyes
are
apt
to
be
dimmed
by
thick
mists
of
passion
and
prejudice
which
cloud
in
a
far
less
degree
the
fields
of
comparative
anatomy
and
geology
my
contribution
to
the
history
of
the
human
mind
consists
of
little
more
than
a
rough
and
purely
provisional
classification
of
facts
gathered
almost
entirely
from
printed
sources
if
there
is
one
general
conclusion
which
seems
to
emerge
from
the
mass
of
particulars
i
venture
to
think
that
it
is
the
essential
similarity
in
the
working
of
the
less
developed
human
mind
among
all
races
which
corresponds
to
the
essential
similarity
in
their
bodily
frame
revealed
by
comparative
anatomy
but
while
this
general
mental
similarity
may
i
believe
be
taken
as
established
we
must
always
be
on
our
guard
against
tracing
to
it
a
multitude
of
particular
resemblances
which
may
be
and
often
are
due
to
simple
diffusion
since
nothing
is
more
certain
than
that
the
various
races
of
men
have
borrowed
from
each
other
many
of
their
arts
and
crafts
their
ideas
customs
and
institutions
to
sift
out
the
elements
of
culture
which
a
race
has
independently
evolved
and
to
distinguish
them
accurately
from
those
which
it
has
derived
from
other
races
is
a
task
of
extreme
difficulty
and
delicacy
which
promises
to
occupy
students
of
man
for
a
long
time
to
come
indeed
so
complex
are
the
facts
and
so
imperfect
in
most
cases
is
the
historical
record
that
it
may
be
doubted
whether
in
regard
to
many
of
the
lower
races
we
shall
ever
arrive
at
more
than
probable
conjectures
since
the
last
edition
of
golden
was
published
some
thirteen
years
ago
i
have
seen
reason
to
change
my
views
on
several
matters
discussed
in
this
concluding
part
of
the
work
and
though
i
have
called
attention
to
these
changes
in
the
text
it
may
be
well
for
the
sake
of
clearness
to
recapitulate
them
here
in
the
first
place
the
arguments
of
edward
westermarck
have
satisfied
me
that
the
solar
theory
of
the
european
which
i
accepted
from
mannhardt
is
very
slightly
if
at
all
supported
by
the
evidence
and
is
probably
erroneous
the
true
explanation
of
the
festivals
i
now
believe
to
be
the
one
advocated
by
westermarck
himself
namely
that
they
are
purificatory
in
intention
the
fire
being
designed
not
as
i
formerly
held
to
reinforce
the
sun
s
light
and
heat
by
sympathetic
magic
but
merely
to
burn
or
repel
the
noxious
things
whether
conceived
as
material
or
spiritual
which
threaten
the
life
of
man
of
animals
and
of
plants
this
aspect
of
the
had
not
wholly
escaped
me
in
former
editions
i
pointed
it
out
explicitly
but
biassed
perhaps
by
the
great
authority
of
mannhardt
i
treated
it
as
secondary
and
subordinate
instead
of
primary
and
dominant
out
of
deference
to
mannhardt
for
whose
work
i
entertain
the
highest
respect
and
because
the
evidence
for
the
purificatory
theory
of
the
fires
is
perhaps
not
quite
conclusive
i
have
in
this
edition
repeated
and
even
reinforced
the
arguments
for
the
solar
theory
of
the
festivals
so
that
the
reader
may
see
for
himself
what
can
be
said
on
both
sides
of
the
question
and
may
draw
his
own
conclusion
but
for
my
part
i
can
not
but
think
that
the
arguments
for
the
purificatory
theory
far
outweigh
the
arguments
for
the
solar
theory
westermarck
based
his
criticisms
largely
on
his
own
observations
of
the
mohammedan
of
morocco
which
present
a
remarkable
resemblance
to
those
of
christian
europe
though
there
seems
no
reason
to
assume
that
herein
africa
has
borrowed
from
europe
or
europe
from
africa
so
far
as
europe
is
concerned
the
evidence
tends
strongly
to
shew
that
the
grand
evil
which
the
festivals
aimed
at
combating
was
witchcraft
and
that
they
were
conceived
to
attain
their
end
by
actually
burning
the
witches
whether
visible
or
invisible
in
the
flames
if
that
was
so
the
wide
prevalence
and
the
immense
popularity
of
the
provides
us
with
a
measure
for
estimating
the
extent
of
the
hold
which
the
belief
in
witchcraft
had
on
the
european
mind
before
the
rise
of
christianity
or
rather
of
rationalism
for
christianity
both
catholic
and
protestant
accepted
the
old
belief
and
enforced
it
in
the
old
way
by
the
faggot
and
the
stake
it
was
not
until
human
reason
at
last
awoke
after
the
long
slumber
of
the
middle
ages
that
this
dreadful
obsession
gradually
passed
away
like
a
dark
cloud
from
the
intellectual
horizon
of
europe
yet
we
should
deceive
ourselves
if
we
imagined
that
the
belief
in
witchcraft
is
even
now
dead
in
the
mass
of
the
people
on
the
contrary
there
is
ample
evidence
to
shew
that
it
only
hibernates
under
the
chilling
influence
of
rationalism
and
that
it
would
start
into
active
life
if
that
influence
were
ever
seriously
relaxed
the
truth
seems
to
be
that
to
this
day
the
peasant
remains
a
pagan
and
savage
at
heart
his
civilization
is
merely
a
thin
veneer
which
the
hard
knocks
of
life
soon
abrade
exposing
the
solid
core
of
paganism
and
savagery
below
the
danger
created
by
a
bottomless
layer
of
ignorance
and
superstition
under
the
crust
of
civilized
society
is
lessened
not
only
by
the
natural
torpidity
and
inertia
of
the
bucolic
mind
but
also
by
the
progressive
decrease
of
the
rural
as
compared
with
the
urban
population
in
modern
states
for
i
believe
it
will
be
found
that
the
artisans
who
congregate
in
towns
are
far
less
retentive
of
primitive
modes
of
thought
than
their
rustic
brethren
in
every
age
cities
have
been
the
centres
and
as
it
were
the
lighthouses
from
which
ideas
radiate
into
the
surrounding
darkness
kindled
by
the
friction
of
mind
with
mind
in
the
crowded
haunts
of
men
and
it
is
natural
that
at
these
beacons
of
intellectual
light
all
should
partake
in
some
measure
of
the
general
illumination
no
doubt
the
mental
ferment
and
unrest
of
great
cities
have
their
dark
as
well
as
their
bright
side
but
among
the
evils
to
be
apprehended
from
them
the
chances
of
a
pagan
revival
need
hardly
be
reckoned
another
point
on
which
i
have
changed
my
mind
is
the
nature
of
the
great
aryan
god
whom
the
romans
called
jupiter
and
the
greeks
zeus
whereas
i
formerly
argued
that
he
was
primarily
a
personification
of
the
sacred
oak
and
only
in
the
second
place
a
personification
of
the
thundering
sky
i
now
invert
the
order
of
his
divine
functions
and
believe
that
he
was
a
before
he
came
to
be
associated
with
the
oak
in
fact
i
revert
to
the
traditional
view
of
jupiter
recant
my
heresy
and
am
gathered
like
a
lost
sheep
into
the
fold
of
mythological
orthodoxy
the
good
shepherd
who
has
brought
me
back
is
my
friend
warde
fowler
he
has
removed
the
stone
over
which
i
stumbled
in
the
wilderness
by
explaining
in
a
simple
and
natural
way
how
a
god
of
the
thundering
sky
might
easily
come
to
be
afterwards
associated
with
the
oak
the
explanation
turns
on
the
great
frequency
with
which
as
statistics
prove
the
oak
is
struck
by
lightning
beyond
any
other
tree
of
the
wood
in
europe
to
our
rude
forefathers
who
dwelt
in
the
gloomy
depths
of
the
primaeval
forest
it
might
well
seem
that
the
riven
and
blackened
oaks
must
indeed
be
favourites
of
the
who
so
often
descended
on
them
from
the
murky
cloud
in
a
flash
of
lightning
and
a
crash
of
thunder
this
change
of
view
as
to
the
great
aryan
god
necessarily
affects
my
interpretation
of
the
king
of
the
wood
the
priest
of
diana
at
aricia
if
i
may
take
that
discarded
puppet
out
of
the
box
again
for
a
moment
on
my
theory
the
priest
represented
jupiter
in
the
flesh
and
accordingly
if
jupiter
was
primarily
a
his
priest
can
not
have
been
a
mere
incarnation
of
the
sacred
oak
but
must
like
the
deity
whose
commission
he
bore
have
been
invested
in
the
imagination
of
his
worshippers
with
the
power
of
overcasting
the
heaven
with
clouds
and
eliciting
storms
of
thunder
and
rain
from
the
celestial
vault
the
attribution
of
powers
to
kings
or
priests
is
very
common
in
primitive
society
and
is
indeed
one
of
the
principal
levers
by
which
such
personages
raise
themselves
to
a
position
of
superiority
above
their
fellows
there
is
therefore
no
improbability
in
the
supposition
that
as
a
representative
of
jupiter
the
priest
of
diana
enjoyed
this
reputation
though
positive
evidence
of
it
appears
to
be
lacking
lastly
in
the
present
edition
i
have
shewn
some
grounds
for
thinking
that
the
golden
bough
itself
or
in
common
parlance
the
mistletoe
on
the
oak
was
supposed
to
have
dropped
from
the
sky
upon
the
tree
in
a
flash
of
lightning
and
therefore
to
contain
within
itself
the
seed
of
celestial
fire
a
sort
of
smouldering
thunderbolt
this
view
of
the
priest
and
of
the
bough
which
he
guarded
at
the
peril
of
his
life
has
the
advantage
of
accounting
for
the
importance
which
the
sanctuary
at
nemi
acquired
and
the
treasure
which
it
amassed
through
the
offerings
of
the
faithful
for
the
shrine
would
seem
to
have
been
to
ancient
what
loreto
has
been
to
modern
italy
a
place
of
pilgrimage
where
princes
and
nobles
as
well
as
commoners
poured
wealth
into
the
coffers
of
diana
in
her
green
recess
among
the
alban
hills
just
as
in
modern
times
kings
and
queens
vied
with
each
other
in
enriching
the
black
virgin
who
from
her
holy
house
on
the
hillside
at
loreto
looks
out
on
the
blue
adriatic
and
the
purple
apennines
such
pious
prodigality
becomes
more
intelligible
if
the
greatest
of
the
gods
was
indeed
believed
to
dwell
in
human
shape
with
his
wife
among
the
woods
of
nemi
these
are
the
principal
points
on
which
i
have
altered
my
opinion
since
the
last
edition
of
my
book
was
published
the
mere
admission
of
such
changes
may
suffice
to
indicate
the
doubt
and
uncertainty
which
attend
enquiries
of
this
nature
the
whole
fabric
of
ancient
mythology
is
so
foreign
to
our
modern
ways
of
thought
and
the
evidence
concerning
it
is
for
the
most
part
so
fragmentary
obscure
and
conflicting
that
in
our
attempts
to
piece
together
and
interpret
it
we
can
hardly
hope
to
reach
conclusions
that
will
completely
satisfy
either
ourselves
or
others
in
this
as
in
other
branches
of
study
it
is
the
fate
of
theories
to
be
washed
away
like
children
s
castles
of
sand
by
the
rising
tide
of
knowledge
and
i
am
not
so
presumptuous
as
to
expect
or
desire
for
mine
an
exemption
from
the
common
lot
i
hold
them
all
very
lightly
and
have
used
them
chiefly
as
convenient
pegs
on
which
to
hang
my
collections
of
facts
for
i
believe
that
while
theories
are
transitory
a
record
of
facts
has
a
permanent
value
and
that
as
a
chronicle
of
ancient
customs
and
beliefs
my
book
may
retain
its
utility
when
my
theories
are
as
obsolete
as
the
customs
and
beliefs
themselves
deserve
to
be
i
can
not
dismiss
without
some
natural
regret
a
task
which
has
occupied
and
amused
me
at
intervals
for
many
years
but
the
regret
is
tempered
by
thankfulness
and
hope
i
am
thankful
that
i
have
been
able
to
conclude
at
least
one
chapter
of
the
work
i
projected
a
long
time
ago
i
am
hopeful
that
i
may
not
now
be
taking
a
final
leave
of
my
indulgent
readers
but
that
as
i
am
sensible
of
little
abatement
in
my
bodily
strength
and
of
none
in
my
ardour
for
study
they
will
bear
with
me
yet
a
while
if
i
should
attempt
to
entertain
them
with
fresh
subjects
of
laughter
and
tears
drawn
from
the
comedy
and
the
tragedy
of
man
s
endless
quest
after
happiness

have
travelled
far
since
we
turned
our
backs
on
nemi
and
set
forth
in
quest
of
the
secret
of
the
golden
bough
with
the
present
volume
we
enter
on
the
last
stage
of
our
long
journey
the
reader
who
has
had
the
patience
to
follow
the
enquiry
thus
far
may
remember
that
at
the
outset
two
questions
were
proposed
for
answer
why
had
the
priest
of
aricia
to
slay
his
predecessor
and
why
before
doing
so
had
he
to
pluck
the
golden
bough
of
these
two
questions
the
first
has
now
been
answered
the
priest
of
aricia
if
i
am
right
was
one
of
those
sacred
kings
or
human
divinities
on
whose
life
the
welfare
of
the
community
and
even
the
course
of
nature
in
general
are
believed
to
be
intimately
dependent
it
does
not
appear
that
the
subjects
or
worshippers
of
such
a
spiritual
potentate
form
to
themselves
any
very
clear
notion
of
the
exact
relationship
in
which
they
stand
to
him
probably
their
ideas
on
the
point
are
vague
and
fluctuating
and
we
should
err
if
we
attempted
to
define
the
relationship
with
logical
precision
all
that
the
people
know
or
rather
imagine
is
that
somehow
they
themselves
their
cattle
and
their
crops
are
mysteriously
bound
up
with
their
divine
king
so
that
according
as
he
is
well
or
ill
the
community
is
healthy
or
sickly
the
flocks
and
herds
thrive
or
languish
with
disease
and
the
fields
yield
an
abundant
or
a
scanty
harvest
the
worst
evil
which
they
can
conceive
of
is
the
natural
death
of
their
ruler
whether
he
succumb
to
sickness
or
old
age
for
in
the
opinion
of
his
followers
such
a
death
would
entail
the
most
disastrous
consequences
on
themselves
and
their
possessions
fatal
epidemics
would
sweep
away
man
and
beast
the
earth
would
refuse
her
increase
nay
the
very
frame
of
nature
itself
might
be
dissolved
to
guard
against
these
catastrophes
it
is
necessary
to
put
the
king
to
death
while
he
is
still
in
the
full
bloom
of
his
divine
manhood
in
order
that
his
sacred
life
transmitted
in
unabated
force
to
his
successor
may
renew
its
youth
and
thus
by
successive
transmissions
through
a
perpetual
line
of
vigorous
incarnations
may
remain
eternally
fresh
and
young
a
pledge
and
security
that
men
and
animals
shall
in
like
manner
renew
their
youth
by
a
perpetual
succession
of
generations
and
that
seedtime
and
harvest
and
summer
and
winter
and
rain
and
sunshine
shall
never
fail
that
if
my
conjecture
is
right
was
why
the
priest
of
aricia
the
king
of
the
wood
at
nemi
had
regularly
to
perish
by
the
sword
of
his
successor
but
we
have
still
to
ask
what
was
the
golden
bough
and
why
had
each
candidate
for
the
arician
priesthood
to
pluck
it
before
he
could
slay
the
priest
these
questions
i
will
now
try
to
answer
it
will
be
well
to
begin
by
noticing
two
of
those
rules
or
taboos
by
which
as
we
have
seen
the
life
of
divine
kings
or
priests
is
regulated
the
first
of
the
rules
to
which
i
desire
to
call
the
reader
s
attention
is
that
the
divine
personage
may
not
touch
the
ground
with
his
foot
this
rule
was
observed
by
the
supreme
pontiff
of
the
zapotecs
in
mexico
he
profaned
his
sanctity
if
he
so
much
as
touched
the
ground
with
his
foot
montezuma
emperor
of
mexico
never
set
foot
on
the
ground
he
was
always
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
noblemen
and
if
he
lighted
anywhere
they
laid
rich
tapestry
for
him
to
walk
upon
for
the
mikado
of
japan
to
touch
the
ground
with
his
foot
was
a
shameful
degradation
indeed
in
the
sixteenth
century
it
was
enough
to
deprive
him
of
his
office
outside
his
palace
he
was
carried
on
men
s
shoulders
within
it
he
walked
on
exquisitely
wrought
mats
the
king
and
queen
of
tahiti
might
not
touch
the
ground
anywhere
but
within
their
hereditary
domains
for
the
ground
on
which
they
trod
became
sacred
in
travelling
from
place
to
place
they
were
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
sacred
men
they
were
always
accompanied
by
several
pairs
of
these
sanctified
attendants
and
when
it
became
necessary
to
change
their
bearers
the
king
and
queen
vaulted
on
to
the
shoulders
of
their
new
bearers
without
letting
their
feet
touch
the
ground
it
was
an
evil
omen
if
the
king
of
dosuma
touched
the
ground
and
he
had
to
perform
an
expiatory
ceremony
within
his
palace
the
king
of
persia
walked
on
carpets
on
which
no
one
else
might
tread
outside
of
it
he
was
never
seen
on
foot
but
only
in
a
chariot
or
on
horseback
in
old
days
the
king
of
siam
never
set
foot
upon
the
earth
but
was
carried
on
a
throne
of
gold
from
place
to
place
formerly
neither
the
kings
of
uganda
nor
their
mothers
nor
their
queens
might
walk
on
foot
outside
of
the
spacious
enclosures
in
which
they
lived
whenever
they
went
forth
they
were
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
men
of
the
buffalo
clan
several
of
whom
accompanied
any
of
these
royal
personages
on
a
journey
and
took
it
in
turn
to
bear
the
burden
the
king
sat
astride
the
bearer
s
neck
with
a
leg
over
each
shoulder
and
his
feet
tucked
under
the
bearer
s
arms
when
one
of
these
royal
carriers
grew
tired
he
shot
the
king
on
to
the
shoulders
of
a
second
man
without
allowing
the
royal
feet
to
touch
the
ground
in
this
way
they
went
at
a
great
pace
and
travelled
long
distances
in
a
day
when
the
king
was
on
a
journey
the
bearers
had
a
special
hut
in
the
king
s
enclosure
in
order
to
be
at
hand
the
moment
they
were
wanted
among
the
bakuba
or
rather
bushongo
a
nation
in
the
southern
region
of
the
congo
down
to
a
few
years
ago
persons
of
the
royal
blood
were
forbidden
to
touch
the
ground
they
must
sit
on
a
hide
a
chair
or
the
back
of
a
slave
who
crouched
on
hands
and
feet
their
feet
rested
on
the
feet
of
others
when
they
travelled
they
were
carried
on
the
backs
of
men
but
the
king
journeyed
in
a
litter
supported
on
shafts
among
the
ibo
people
about
awka
in
southern
nigeria
the
priest
of
the
earth
has
to
observe
many
taboos
for
example
he
may
not
see
a
corpse
and
if
he
meets
one
on
the
road
he
must
hide
his
eyes
with
his
wristlet
he
must
abstain
from
many
foods
such
as
eggs
birds
of
all
sorts
mutton
dog
and
so
forth
he
may
neither
wear
nor
touch
a
mask
and
no
masked
man
may
enter
his
house
if
a
dog
enters
his
house
it
is
killed
and
thrown
out
as
priest
of
the
earth
he
may
not
sit
on
the
bare
ground
nor
eat
things
that
have
fallen
on
the
ground
nor
may
earth
be
thrown
at
him
according
to
ancient
brahmanic
ritual
a
king
at
his
inauguration
trod
on
a
tiger
s
skin
and
a
golden
plate
he
was
shod
with
shoes
of
boar
s
skin
and
so
long
as
he
lived
thereafter
he
might
not
stand
on
the
earth
with
his
bare
feet
but
besides
persons
who
are
permanently
sacred
or
tabooed
and
are
therefore
permanently
forbidden
to
touch
the
ground
with
their
feet
there
are
others
who
enjoy
the
character
of
sanctity
or
taboo
only
on
certain
occasions
and
to
whom
accordingly
the
prohibition
in
question
only
applies
at
the
definite
seasons
during
which
they
exhale
the
odour
of
sanctity
thus
among
the
kayans
or
bahaus
of
central
borneo
while
the
priestesses
are
engaged
in
the
performance
of
certain
rites
they
may
not
step
on
the
ground
and
boards
are
laid
for
them
to
tread
on
at
a
funeral
ceremony
observed
by
night
among
the
michemis
a
tibetan
tribe
near
the
northern
frontier
of
assam
a
priest
fantastically
bedecked
with
tiger
s
teeth
plumes
bells
and
shells
executed
a
wild
dance
for
the
purpose
of
exorcising
the
evil
spirits
then
all
fires
were
extinguished
and
a
new
light
was
struck
by
a
man
suspended
by
his
feet
from
a
beam
in
the
ceiling
he
did
not
touch
the
ground
we
are
told
in
order
to
indicate
that
the
light
came
from
again
newly
born
infants
are
strongly
tabooed
accordingly
in
loango
they
are
not
allowed
to
touch
the
earth
among
the
iluvans
of
malabar
the
bridegroom
on
his
is
bathed
by
seven
young
men
and
then
carried
or
walks
on
planks
from
the
to
the
marriage
booth
he
may
not
touch
the
ground
with
his
feet
with
the
dyaks
of
landak
and
tajan
two
districts
of
dutch
borneo
it
is
a
custom
that
for
a
certain
time
after
marriage
neither
bride
nor
bridegroom
may
tread
on
the
earth
warriors
again
on
the
are
surrounded
so
to
say
by
an
atmosphere
of
taboo
hence
some
indians
of
north
america
might
not
sit
on
the
bare
ground
the
whole
time
they
were
out
on
a
warlike
expedition
in
laos
the
hunting
of
elephants
gives
rise
to
many
taboos
one
of
them
is
that
the
chief
hunter
may
not
touch
the
earth
with
his
foot
accordingly
when
he
alights
from
his
elephant
the
others
spread
a
carpet
of
leaves
for
him
to
step
upon
german
wiseacres
recommended
that
when
witches
were
led
to
the
block
or
the
stake
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
touch
the
bare
earth
and
a
reason
suggested
for
the
rule
was
that
if
they
touched
the
earth
they
might
make
themselves
invisible
and
so
escape
the
sagacious
author
of
in
the
eighteenth
century
ridicules
the
idea
as
mere
silly
talk
he
admits
indeed
that
the
women
were
conveyed
to
the
place
of
execution
in
carts
but
he
denies
that
there
is
any
deep
significance
in
the
cart
and
he
is
prepared
to
maintain
this
view
by
a
chemical
analysis
of
the
timber
of
which
the
cart
was
built
to
clinch
his
argument
he
appeals
to
plain
matter
of
fact
and
his
own
personal
experience
not
a
single
instance
he
assures
us
with
apparent
satisfaction
can
be
produced
of
a
witch
who
escaped
the
axe
or
the
fire
in
this
fashion
i
have
myself
says
he
in
my
youth
seen
divers
witches
burned
some
at
arnstadt
some
at
ilmenau
some
at
schwenda
a
noble
village
between
arnstadt
and
ilmenau
and
some
of
them
were
pardoned
and
beheaded
before
being
burned
they
were
laid
on
the
earth
in
the
place
of
execution
and
beheaded
like
any
other
poor
sinner
whereas
if
they
could
have
escaped
by
touching
the
earth
not
one
of
them
would
have
failed
to
do
apparently
holiness
magical
virtue
taboo
or
whatever
we
may
call
that
mysterious
quality
which
is
supposed
to
pervade
sacred
or
tabooed
persons
is
conceived
by
the
primitive
philosopher
as
a
physical
substance
or
fluid
with
which
the
sacred
man
is
charged
just
as
a
leyden
jar
is
charged
with
electricity
and
exactly
as
the
electricity
in
the
jar
can
be
discharged
by
contact
with
a
good
conductor
so
the
holiness
or
magical
virtue
in
the
man
can
be
discharged
and
drained
away
by
contact
with
the
earth
which
on
this
theory
serves
as
an
excellent
conductor
for
the
magical
fluid
hence
in
order
to
preserve
the
charge
from
running
to
waste
the
sacred
or
tabooed
personage
must
be
carefully
prevented
from
touching
the
ground
in
electrical
language
he
must
be
insulated
if
he
is
not
to
be
emptied
of
the
precious
substance
or
fluid
with
which
he
as
a
vial
is
filled
to
the
brim
and
in
many
cases
apparently
the
insulation
of
the
tabooed
person
is
recommended
as
a
precaution
not
merely
for
his
own
sake
but
for
the
sake
of
others
for
since
the
virtue
of
holiness
or
taboo
is
so
to
say
a
powerful
explosive
which
the
smallest
touch
may
detonate
it
is
necessary
in
the
interest
of
the
general
safety
to
keep
it
within
narrow
bounds
lest
breaking
out
it
should
blast
blight
and
destroy
whatever
it
comes
into
contact
with
but
things
as
well
as
persons
are
often
charged
with
the
mysterious
quality
of
holiness
or
taboo
hence
it
frequently
becomes
necessary
for
similar
reasons
to
guard
them
also
from
coming
into
contact
with
the
ground
lest
they
should
in
like
manner
be
drained
of
their
valuable
properties
and
be
reduced
to
mere
commonplace
material
objects
empty
husks
from
which
the
good
grain
has
been
eliminated
thus
for
example
the
most
sacred
object
of
the
arunta
tribe
in
central
australia
is
or
rather
used
to
be
a
pole
about
twenty
feet
high
which
is
completely
smeared
with
human
blood
crowned
with
an
imitation
of
a
human
head
and
set
up
on
the
ground
where
the
final
initiatory
ceremonies
of
young
men
are
performed
a
young
is
chosen
to
form
the
pole
and
it
must
be
cut
down
and
transported
in
such
a
way
that
it
does
not
touch
the
earth
till
it
is
erected
in
its
place
on
the
holy
ground
apparently
the
pole
represents
some
famous
ancestor
of
the
olden
time
again
at
a
great
dancing
festival
celebrated
by
the
natives
of
bartle
bay
in
british
new
guinea
a
wild
mango
tree
plays
a
prominent
part
the
tree
must
be
that
is
really
wild
and
so
young
that
it
has
never
flowered
it
is
chosen
in
the
jungle
some
five
or
six
weeks
before
the
festival
and
a
circle
is
cleared
round
its
trunk
from
that
time
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
and
some
eight
to
twenty
other
men
who
have
aided
him
in
choosing
the
tree
and
in
clearing
the
jungle
become
strictly
holy
or
tabooed
they
sleep
by
themselves
in
a
house
into
which
no
one
else
may
intrude
they
may
not
wash
or
drink
water
nor
even
allow
it
accidentally
to
touch
their
bodies
they
are
forbidden
to
eat
boiled
food
and
the
fruit
of
mango
trees
they
may
drink
only
the
milk
of
a
young
which
has
been
baked
and
they
may
eat
certain
fruits
and
vegetables
such
as
and
but
only
on
condition
that
they
have
been
baked
all
refuse
of
their
food
is
kept
in
baskets
in
their
and
may
not
be
removed
from
it
till
the
festival
is
over
at
the
time
when
the
men
begin
to
observe
these
rules
of
abstinence
some
six
to
ten
women
members
of
the
same
clan
as
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
enter
on
a
like
period
of
mortification
avoiding
the
company
of
the
other
sex
and
refraining
from
water
all
boiled
food
and
the
fruit
of
the
mango
tree
these
fasting
men
and
women
are
the
principal
dancers
at
the
festival
the
dancing
takes
place
on
a
special
platform
in
a
temporary
village
which
has
been
erected
for
the
purpose
when
the
platform
is
about
to
be
set
up
the
fasting
men
rub
the
stepping
posts
and
then
suck
their
hands
for
the
purpose
of
extracting
the
ghost
of
any
dead
man
that
might
chance
to
be
in
the
post
and
might
be
injured
by
the
weight
of
the
platform
pressing
down
on
him
having
carefully
extracted
these
poor
souls
the
men
carry
them
away
tenderly
and
set
them
free
in
the
forest
or
the
long
grass
on
the
day
before
the
festival
one
of
the
fasting
men
cuts
down
the
chosen
mango
tree
in
the
jungle
with
a
stone
adze
which
is
never
afterwards
put
to
any
other
use
an
iron
tool
may
not
be
used
for
the
purpose
though
iron
tools
are
now
common
enough
in
the
district
in
cutting
down
the
mango
they
place
nets
on
the
ground
to
catch
any
leaves
or
twigs
that
might
fall
from
the
tree
as
it
is
being
felled
and
they
surround
the
trunk
with
new
mats
to
receive
the
chips
which
fly
out
under
the
adze
of
the
woodman
for
the
chips
may
not
drop
on
the
earth
once
the
tree
is
down
it
is
carried
to
the
centre
of
the
temporary
village
the
greatest
care
being
taken
to
prevent
it
from
coming
into
contact
with
the
ground
but
when
it
is
brought
into
the
village
the
houses
are
connected
with
the
top
of
the
mango
by
means
of
long
vines
decorated
with
streamers
in
the
afternoon
the
fasting
men
and
women
begin
to
dance
the
men
bedizened
with
gay
feathers
armlets
streamers
and
anklets
the
women
flaunting
in
petticoats
and
sprigs
of
croton
leaves
which
wave
from
their
waistbands
as
they
dance
the
dancing
stops
at
sundown
and
when
the
full
moon
rises
over
the
shoulder
of
the
eastern
hill
for
the
date
of
the
festival
seems
to
be
determined
with
reference
to
the
time
of
the
moon
two
chiefs
mount
the
gables
of
two
houses
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
square
and
their
dusky
figures
standing
sharply
out
against
the
moonlight
pray
to
the
evil
spirits
to
go
away
and
not
to
hurt
the
people
next
morning
pigs
are
killed
by
being
speared
as
slowly
as
possible
in
order
that
they
may
squeal
loud
and
long
for
the
people
believe
that
the
mango
trees
hear
the
squealing
and
are
pleased
at
the
sound
and
bear
plenty
of
fruit
whereas
if
they
heard
no
squeals
they
would
bear
no
fruit
however
the
trees
have
to
content
themselves
with
the
squeals
the
flesh
of
the
pigs
is
eaten
by
the
people
this
ends
the
festival
next
day
the
mango
is
taken
down
from
the
platform
wrapt
in
new
mats
and
carried
by
the
fasting
men
to
their
sleeping
house
where
it
is
hung
from
the
roof
but
after
an
interval
it
may
be
of
many
months
the
tree
is
brought
forth
again
as
to
the
reason
for
its
reappearance
in
public
opinions
are
divided
but
some
say
that
the
tree
itself
orders
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
to
bring
it
forth
appearing
to
him
in
his
dreams
and
saying
let
me
smell
the
smoking
fat
of
pigs
so
will
your
pigs
be
healthy
and
your
crops
will
be
that
as
it
may
out
it
comes
conducted
by
the
fasting
men
in
their
dancing
costume
and
with
it
come
in
the
solemn
procession
all
the
pots
spoons
cups
and
so
forth
used
by
the
fasting
men
during
their
period
of
holiness
or
taboo
also
all
the
refuse
of
their
food
which
has
been
collected
for
months
and
all
the
fallen
leaves
and
chips
of
the
mango
in
their
bundles
of
mats
these
holy
relics
are
carried
in
front
and
the
mango
tree
itself
brings
up
the
rear
of
the
procession
while
these
sacred
objects
are
being
handed
out
of
the
house
the
men
who
are
present
rush
up
wipe
off
the
hallowed
dust
which
has
accumulated
on
them
and
smear
it
over
their
own
bodies
no
doubt
in
order
to
steep
themselves
in
their
blessed
influence
thus
the
tree
is
carried
as
before
to
the
centre
of
the
temporary
village
care
being
again
taken
not
to
let
it
touch
the
ground
then
one
of
the
fasting
men
takes
from
a
basket
a
number
of
young
green
mangoes
cuts
them
in
pieces
and
places
them
with
his
own
hands
in
the
mouths
of
his
fellows
the
other
fasting
men
who
chew
the
pieces
small
and
turning
round
spit
the
morsels
in
the
direction
of
the
setting
sun
in
order
that
the
sun
should
carry
the
mango
bits
over
the
whole
country
and
everyone
should
a
portion
of
the
mango
tree
is
then
broken
off
and
in
the
evening
it
is
burnt
along
with
the
bundles
of
leaves
chips
and
refuse
of
food
which
have
been
stored
up
what
remains
of
the
tree
is
taken
to
the
house
of
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
and
hung
over
the
it
will
be
brought
out
again
at
intervals
and
burned
bit
by
bit
till
all
is
consumed
whereupon
a
new
mango
will
be
cut
down
and
treated
in
like
manner
the
ashes
of
the
holy
fire
on
each
occasion
are
gathered
by
the
people
and
preserved
in
the
house
of
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
the
meaning
of
these
ceremonies
is
not
explained
by
the
authorities
who
describe
them
but
we
may
conjecture
that
they
are
intended
to
fertilize
the
mango
trees
and
cause
them
to
bear
a
good
crop
of
fruit
the
central
feature
of
the
whole
ritual
is
a
wild
mango
tree
so
young
that
it
has
never
flowered
the
men
who
cut
it
down
carry
it
into
the
village
and
dance
at
the
festival
are
forbidden
to
eat
mangoes
pigs
are
killed
in
order
that
their
dying
squeals
may
move
the
mango
trees
to
bear
fruit
at
the
end
of
the
ceremonies
pieces
of
young
green
mangoes
are
solemnly
placed
in
the
mouths
of
the
fasting
men
and
are
by
them
spurted
out
towards
the
setting
sun
in
order
that
the
luminary
may
carry
the
fragments
to
every
part
of
the
country
and
finally
when
after
a
longer
or
shorter
interval
the
tree
is
wholly
consumed
its
place
is
supplied
by
another
all
these
circumstances
are
explained
simply
and
naturally
by
the
supposition
that
the
young
mango
tree
is
taken
as
a
representative
of
mangoes
generally
that
the
dances
are
intended
to
quicken
it
and
that
it
is
preserved
like
a
of
old
in
england
as
a
sort
of
general
fund
of
vegetable
life
till
the
fund
being
exhausted
by
the
destruction
of
the
tree
it
is
renewed
by
the
importation
of
a
fresh
young
tree
from
the
forest
we
can
therefore
understand
why
as
a
storehouse
of
vital
energy
the
tree
should
be
carefully
kept
from
contact
with
the
ground
lest
the
and
concentrated
energy
should
escape
and
dribbling
away
into
the
earth
be
dissipated
to
no
purpose
to
take
other
instances
of
what
we
may
call
the
conservation
of
energy
in
magic
or
religion
by
insulating
sacred
bodies
from
the
ground
the
natives
of
new
britain
have
a
secret
society
called
the
the
members
of
which
masquerade
in
petticoats
of
leaves
and
tall
headdresses
of
wickerwork
shaped
like
candle
extinguishers
which
descend
to
the
shoulders
of
the
wearers
completely
concealing
their
faces
thus
disguised
they
dance
about
to
the
awe
and
terror
real
or
assumed
of
the
women
and
uninitiated
who
take
or
pretend
to
take
them
for
spirits
when
lads
are
being
initiated
into
the
secrets
of
this
august
society
the
adepts
cut
down
some
very
large
and
heavy
bamboos
one
for
each
lad
and
the
novices
carry
them
carefully
wrapt
up
in
leaves
to
the
sacred
ground
where
they
arrive
very
tired
and
weary
for
they
may
not
let
the
bamboos
touch
the
ground
nor
the
sun
shine
on
them
outside
the
fence
of
the
enclosure
every
lad
deposits
his
bamboo
on
a
couple
of
forked
sticks
and
covers
it
up
with
nut
leaves
among
the
carrier
indians
of
america
who
burned
their
dead
the
ashes
of
a
chief
used
to
be
placed
in
a
box
and
set
on
the
top
of
a
pole
beside
his
hut
the
box
was
never
allowed
to
touch
the
ground
in
the
omaha
tribe
of
north
american
indians
the
sacred
clam
shell
of
the
elk
clan
was
wrapt
up
from
sight
in
a
mat
placed
on
a
stand
and
never
suffered
to
come
in
contact
with
the
earth
the
cherokees
and
kindred
indian
tribes
of
the
united
states
used
to
have
certain
sacred
boxes
or
arks
which
they
regularly
took
with
them
to
war
such
a
holy
ark
consisted
of
a
square
wooden
box
which
contained
certain
consecrated
vessels
made
by
beloved
superannuated
women
and
of
such
various
antiquated
forms
as
would
have
puzzled
adam
to
have
given
significant
names
to
the
leader
of
a
war
party
and
his
attendant
bore
the
ark
by
turns
but
they
never
set
it
on
the
ground
nor
would
they
themselves
sit
on
the
bare
earth
while
they
were
carrying
it
against
the
enemy
where
stones
were
plentiful
they
rested
the
ark
on
them
but
where
no
stones
were
to
be
found
they
deposited
it
on
short
logs
the
indian
ark
is
deemed
so
sacred
and
dangerous
to
be
touched
either
by
their
own
sanctified
warriors
or
the
spoiling
enemy
that
they
durst
not
touch
it
upon
any
account
it
is
not
to
be
meddled
with
by
any
except
the
war
chieftain
and
his
waiter
under
the
penalty
of
incurring
great
evil
nor
would
the
most
inveterate
enemy
touch
it
in
the
woods
for
the
very
same
after
their
return
home
they
used
to
hang
the
ark
on
the
leader

war
pole
at
sipi

an
annual
fair

on

and
long
petticoats

from
it
nearly
to

three
sides
of

are
adorned
with
the
head
and

they
dance
round
with
a
swinging
rhythmical
step
to
the
music
of
drums
and
a
pipe
the
dance
goes
on
for
hours
and
is
thought
to
avert
from
the
fair
it
is
said
that
the
box
is
brought
to
simla
from
a
place
sixty
miles
off
by
relays
of
men
who
may
not
stop
nor
set

circumstances
be
brought
into

with
the

some
of
the
aborigines
of
victoria
used
to
regard
the
fat
of
the
emu
as
sacred
believing
that
it
had
once
been
the
fat
of
the
black
man
in
taking
it
from
the
bird
or
giving
it
to
another
they
handled
it
reverently
any
one
who
threw
away
the
fat
or
flesh
of
the
emu
was
held
accursed
the
late
thomas
observed
on
one
occasion
at
a
remarkable
exhibition
of
the
effects
of
this
superstition
an
aboriginal
attending
the
eaten
some
part
of
the
flesh
of
an
emu
threw
away
the
skin
the
skin
fell
to
the
ground
and
this
being
observed
by
his
parents
they
showed
by
their
gestures
every
token
of
horror
they
looked
upon
their
child
as
one
utterly
lost
his
desecration
of
the
bird
was
regarded
as
a
sin
for
which
there
was
no
the
roumanians
of
transylvania
believe
that
every
loaf
of
wheaten
bread
is
sacred
and
should
a
piece
inadvertently
fall
to
the
ground
it
is
hastily
picked
up
carefully
wiped
and
kissed
and
if
soiled
thrown
into
the
as
an
offering
to
the
dead
and
partly
because
it
were
a
heavy
sin
to
throw
away
or
tread
upon
any
particle
of
at
certain
festivals
in
borneo
the
food
which
is
consumed
in
the
common
house
may
not
touch
the
ground
hence
a
little
before
the
festivals
take
place
made
of
thin
poles
are
constructed
from
the
private
dwellings
to
the
common
house
when
hall
was
living
with
the
esquimaux
and
grew
tired
of
eating
walrus
one
of
the
women
brought
the
head
and
neck
of
a
reindeer
for
him
to
eat
this
venison
had
to
be
completely
wrapt
up
before
it
was
brought
into
the
house
and
once
in
the
house
it
could
only
be
placed
on
the
platform
which
served
as
a
bed
to
have
placed
it
on
the
floor
or
on
the
platform
behind
the
among
the
walrus
and
meat
which
occupy
a
goodly
portion
of
both
of
these
places
would
have
horrified
the
whole
town
as
according
to
the
actual
belief
of
the
innuits
not
another
walrus
could
be
secured
this
year
and
there
would
ever
be
trouble
in
catching
any
but
in
this
case
the
real
scruple
appears
to
have
been
felt
not
so
much
at
placing
the
venison
on
the
ground
as
at
bringing
it
into
contact
with
walrus
meat
sometimes
magical
implements
and
remedies
are
supposed
to
lose
their
virtue
by
contact
with
the
ground
the
volatile
essence
with
which
they
are
impregnated
being
no
doubt
drained
off
into
the
earth
thus
in
the
boulia
district
of
queensland
the
magical
bone
which
the
native
sorcerer
points
at
his
victim
as
a
means
of
killing
him
is
never
by
any
chance
allowed
to
touch
the
earth
the
wives
of
rajahs
in
macassar
a
district
of
southern
celebes
pride
themselves
on
their
luxuriant
tresses
and
are
at
great
pains
to
oil
and
preserve
them
should
the
hair
begin
to
grow
thin
the

resorts
to
many
devices
to
stay
the
ravages
of
time
among
other
things
she
applies
to
her
locks
a
fat
extracted
from
crocodiles
and
venomous
snakes
the
unguent
is
believed
to
be
very
efficacious
but
during
its
application
the
woman
s
feet
may
not
come
into
contact
with
the
ground
or
all
the
benefit
of
the
nostrum
would
be
lost
some
people
in
antiquity
believed
that
a
woman
in
hard
labour
would
be
delivered
if
a
spear
which
had
been
wrenched
from
a
man
s
body
without
touching
the
ground
were
thrown
over
the
house
where
the
sufferer
lay
again
according
to
certain
ancient
writers
arrows
which
had
been
extracted
from
a
body
without
coming
into
contact
with
the
earth
and
laid
under
sleepers
acted
as
a
among
the
peasantry
of
the
of
scotland
the
prehistoric
weapons
called
celts
went
by
the
name
of
thunderbolts
and
were
coveted
as
the
sure
bringers
of
success
always
provided
that
they
were
not
allowed
to
fall
to
the
ground
in
ancient
gaul
certain
glass
or
paste
beads
attained
great
celebrity
as
amulets
under
the
name
of
serpents
eggs
it
was
believed
that
serpents
coiling
together
in
a
wriggling
writhing
mass
generated
them
from
their
slaver
and
shot
them
into
the
air
from
their
hissing
jaws
if
a
man
was
bold
and
dexterous
enough
to
catch
one
of
these
eggs
in
his
cloak
before
it
touched
the
ground
he
rode
off
on
horseback
with
it
at
full
speed
pursued
by
the
whole
pack
of
serpents
till
he
was
saved
by
the
interposition
of
a
river
which
the
snakes
could
not
pass
the
proof
of
the
egg
being
genuine
was
that
if
it
were
thrown
into
a
stream
it
would
float
up
against
the
current
even
though
it
were
hooped
in
gold
the
druids
held
these
beads
in
high
esteem
according
to
them
the
precious
objects
could
only
be
obtained
on
a
certain
day
of
the
moon
and
the
peculiar
virtue
that
resided
in
them
was
to
secure
success
in
law
suits
and
free
access
to
kings
pliny
knew
of
a
gaulish
knight
who
was
executed
by
the
emperor
claudius
for
wearing
one
of
these
amulets
under
the
name
of
snake
stones
or
adder
stones
the
beads
are
still
known
in
those
parts
of
our
own
country
where
the
celtic
population
has
lingered
with
its
immemorial
superstitions
down
to
the
present
or
recent
times
and
the
old
story
of
the
origin
of
the
beads
from
the
slaver
of
serpents
was
believed
by
the
modern
peasantry
of
cornwall
wales
and
scotland
as
by
the
druids
of
ancient
gaul
in
cornwall
the
time
when
the
serpents
united
to
fashion
the
beads
was
commonly
said
to
be
at
or
about
midsummer
eve
in
wales
it
was
usually
thought
to
be
spring
especially
the
eve
of
may
day
and
even
within
recent
years
persons
in
the
principality
have
affirmed
that
they
witnessed
the
great
vernal
congress
of
the
snakes
and
saw
the
magic
stone
in
the
midst
of
the
froth
the
welsh
peasants
believe
the
beads
to
possess
medicinal
virtues
of
many
sorts
and
to
be
particularly
efficacious
for
all
maladies
of
the
eyes
in
wales
and
ireland
the
beads
sometimes
went
by
the
name
of
the
magician
s
or

in

saying
that
when

by

jointly
one
of
the

sticks
his

an
englishman
who
visited

in

many
of
these

in

throughout
the

they
were
hung
from
children
s

to
protect
them
from
whooping

and
other
ailments
snake

were
moreover
a
charm
to
ensure
prosperity
in
general
and
to
repel
evil
spirits
when
one
of
these
priceless
treasures
was
not
on
active
service

kept

if
they

the
curious
medical
treatise
of
marcellus
a
native
of
bordeaux
in
the
fourth
century
of
our
era
abounds
with
prescriptions
of
this
sort
and
we
can
well
believe
the
writer
when
he
assures
us
that
he
borrowed
many
of
his
quaint
remedies
from
the
lips
of
common
folk
and
peasants
rather
than
from
the
books
of
the
learned
thus
he
tells
us
that
certain
white
stones
found
in
the
stomachs
of
young
swallows
assuage
the
most
persistent
headache
always
provided
that
their
virtue
be
not
impaired
by
contact
with

another
of
his
cures
for
the

malady
is
a
wreath
of
fleabane
placed
on

it

not

it

second
that
it

third
that

another
cure

is
effected

with

on
it
that
the

excellent
crop
and
will
not
shed
their
fruit
untimely

but
in
order
to
preserve
these
remarkable
properties
it
is
absolutely
essential
that
the
water
should
on
no
account
be
allowed
to
touch
the
ground
some
say
too
that
it
should
not
be
exposed
to
the
sun
nor
breathed
upon
by
anybody
again
the
moors
ascribe
great
magical
efficacy
to
what
they
call
the
sultan
of
the
oleander
which
is
a
stalk
of
oleander
with
a
cluster
of
four
pairs
of
leaves
springing
from
it
they
think
that
the
magical
virtue
is
greatest
if
the
stalk
has
been
cut
immediately
before
midsummer
but
when
the
plant
is
brought
into
the
house
the
branches
may
not
touch
the
ground
lest
they
should
lose
their
marvellous
qualities
in
the
olden
days
before
a
lithuanian
or
prussian
farmer
went
forth
to
plough
for
the
first
time
in
spring
he
called
in
a
wizard
to
perform
a
certain
ceremony
for
the
good
of
the
crops
the
sage
seized
a
mug
of
beer
with
his
teeth
quaffed
the
liquor
and
then
tossed
the
mug
over
his
head
this
signified
that
the
corn
in
that
year
should
grow
taller
than
a
man
but
the
mug
might
not
fall
to
the
ground
it
had
to
be
caught
by
somebody
stationed
at
the
wizard
s
back
for
if
it
fell
to
the
ground
the
consequence
naturally
would
be
that
the
corn
also
would
be
laid
low
on
the
earth
not
to
see
the
sun
the
second
rule
to
be
here
noted
is
that
the
sun
may
not
shine
upon
the
divine
person
this
rule
was
observed
both
by
the
mikado
and
by
the
pontiff
of
the
zapotecs
the
latter
was
looked
upon
as
a
god
whom
the
earth
was
not
worthy
to
hold
nor
the
sun
to
shine
the
japanese
would
not
allow
that
the
mikado
should
expose
his
sacred
person
to
the
open
air
and
the
sun
was
not
thought
worthy
to
shine
on
his
head
the
indians
of
granada
in
south
america
kept
those
who
were
to
be
rulers
or
commanders
whether
men
or
women
locked
up
for
several
years
when
they
were
children
some
of
them
seven
years
and
this
so
close
that
they
were
not
to
see
the
sun
for
if
they
should
happen
to
see
it
they
forfeited
their
lordship
eating
certain
sorts
of
food
appointed
and
those
who
were
their
keepers
at
certain
times
went
into
their
retreat
or
prison
and
scourged
them
thus
for
example
the
heir
to
the
throne
of
bogota
who
was
not
the
son
but
the
sister
s
son
of
the
king
had
to
undergo
a
rigorous
training
from
his
infancy
he
lived
in
complete
retirement
in
a
temple
where
he
might
not
see
the
sun
nor
eat
salt
nor
converse
with
a
woman
he
was
surrounded
by
guards
who
observed
his
conduct
and
noted
all
his
actions
if
he
broke
a
single
one
of
the
rules
laid
down
for
him
he
was
deemed
infamous
and
forfeited
all
his
rights
to
the
throne
so
too
the
heir
to
the
kingdom
of
sogamoso
before
succeeding
to
the
crown
had
to
fast
for
seven
years
in
the
temple
being
shut
up
in
the
dark
and
not
allowed
to
see
the
sun
or
light
the
prince
who
was
to
become
inca
of
peru
had
to
fast
for
a
month
without
seeing
light
on
the
day
when
a
brahman
student
of
the
veda
took
a
bath
to
signify
that
the
time
of
his
studentship
was
at
an
end
he
entered
a
before
sunrise
hung
over
the
door
a
skin
with
the
hair
inside
and
sat
there
on
that
day
the
sun
should
not
shine
upon
him
again
women
after
childbirth
and
their
offspring
are
more
or
less
tabooed
all
the
world
over
hence
in
corea
the
rays
of
the
sun
are
rigidly
excluded
from
both
mother
and
child
for
a
period
of
or
a
hundred
days
according
to
their
rank
after
the
birth
has
taken
place
among
some
of
the
tribes
on
the
coast
of
new
guinea
a
woman
may
not
leave
the
house
for
months
after
childbirth
when
she
does
go
out
she
must
cover
her
head
with
a
hood
or
mat
for
if
the
sun
were
to
shine
upon
her
it
is
thought
that
one
of
her
male
relations
would
die
again
mourners
are
everywhere
taboo
accordingly
in
mourning
the
ainos
of
japan
wear
peculiar
caps
in
order
that
the
sun
may
not
shine
upon
their
heads
during
a
solemn
fast
of
three
days
the
indians
of
costa
rica
eat
no
salt
speak
as
little
as
possible
light
no
fires
and
stay
strictly
indoors
or
if
they
go
out
during
the
day
they
carefully
cover
themselves
from
the
light
of
the
sun
believing
that
exposure
to
the
sun
s
rays
would
turn
them
black
on
yule
night
it
has
been
customary
in
parts
of
sweden
from
time
immemorial
to
go
on
pilgrimage
whereby
people
learn
many
secret
things
and
know
what
is
to
happen
in
the
coming
year
as
a
preparation
for
this
pilgrimage
some
secrete
themselves
for
three
days
previously
in
a
dark
cellar
so
as
to
be
shut
out
altogether
from
the
light
of
heaven
others
retire
at
an
early
hour
of
the
preceding
morning
to
some
place
such
as
a
where
they
bury
themselves
in
the
hay
that
they
may
neither
see
nor
hear
any
living
creature
and
here
they
remain
in
silence
and
fasting
until
after
sundown
whilst
there
are
those
who
think
it
sufficient
if
they
rigidly
abstain
from
food
on
the
day
before
commencing
their
wanderings
during
this
period
of
probation
a
man
ought
not
to
see
fire
but
should
this
have
happened
he
must
strike
a
light
with
flint
and
steel
whereby
the
evil
that
would
otherwise
have
ensued
will
be
during
the
sixteen
days
that
a
pima
indian
is
undergoing
purification
for
killing
an
apache
he
may
not
see
a
blazing
fire
acarnanian
peasants
tell
of
a
handsome
prince
called
sunless
who
would
die
if
he
saw
the
sun
so
he
lived
in
an
underground
palace
on
the
site
of
the
ancient
oeniadae
but
at
night
he
came
forth
and
crossed
the
river
to
visit
a
famous
enchantress
who
dwelt
in
a
castle
on
the
further
bank
she
was
loth
to
part
with
him
every
night
long
before
the
sun
was
up
and
as
he
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
all
her
entreaties
to
linger
she
hit
upon
the
device
of
cutting
the
throats
of
all
the
cocks
in
the
neighbourhood
so
the
prince
whose
ear
had
learned
to
expect
the
shrill
clarion
of
the
birds
as
the
signal
of
the
growing
light
tarried
too
long
and
hardly
had
he
reached
the
ford
when
the
sun
rose
over
the
aetolian
mountains
and
its
fatal
beams
fell
on
him
before
he
could
regain
his
dark
abode
chapter
ii
the
seclusion
of
girls
at
puberty
seclusion
of
girls
at
puberty
in
africa
now
it
is
remarkable
that
the
foregoing
two
to
touch
the
ground
and
not
to
see
the
observed
either
separately
or
conjointly
by
girls
at
puberty
in
many
parts
of
the
world
thus
amongst
the
negroes
of
loango
girls
at
puberty
are
confined
in
separate
huts
and
they
may
not
touch
the
ground
with
any
part
of
their
bare
body
among
the
zulus
and
kindred
tribes
of
south
africa
when
the
first
signs
of
puberty
shew
themselves
while
a
girl
is
walking
gathering
wood
or
working
in
the
field
she
runs
to
the
river
and
hides
herself
among
the
reeds
for
the
day
so
as
not
to
be
seen
by
men
she
covers
her
head
carefully
with
her
blanket
that
the
sun
may
not
shine
on
it
and
shrivel
her
up
into
a
withered
skeleton
as
would
result
from
exposure
to
the
sun
s
beams
after
dark
she
returns
to
her
home
and
is
secluded
in
a
hut
for
some
time
during
her
seclusion
which
lasts
for
about
a
fortnight
neither
she
nor
the
girls
who
wait
upon
her
may
drink
any
milk
lest
the
cattle
should
die
and
should
she
be
overtaken
by
the
first
flow
while
she
is
in
the
fields
she
must
after
hiding
in
the
bush
scrupulously
avoid
all
pathways
in
returning
home
a
reason
for
this
avoidance
is
assigned
by
the
of
british
east
africa
whose
girls
under
similar
circumstances
observe
the
same
rule
a
girl
s
first
menstruation
is
a
very
critical
period
of
her
life
according
to
beliefs
if
this
condition
appears
when
she
is
away
from
the
village
say
at
work
in
the
fields
she
returns
at
once
to
her
village
but
is
careful
to
walk
through
the
grass
and
not
on
a
path
for
if
she
followed
a
path
and
a
stranger
accidentally
trod
on
a
spot
of
blood
and
then
cohabited
with
a
member
of
the
opposite
sex
before
the
girl
was
better
again
it
is
believed
that
she
would
never
bear
a
she
remains
at
home
till
the
symptoms
have
ceased
and
during
this
time
she
may
be
fed
by
none
but
her
mother
when
the
flux
is
over
her
father
and
mother
are
bound
to
cohabit
with
each
other
else
it
is
believed
that
the
girl
would
be
barren
all
her
life
similarly
among
the
baganda
when
a
girl
menstruated
for
the
first
time
she
was
secluded
and
not
allowed
to
handle
food
and
at
the
end
of
her
seclusion
the
kinsman
with
whom
she
was
staying
for
among
the
baganda
young
people
did
not
reside
with
their
parents
was
obliged
to
jump
over
his
wife
which
with
the
baganda
is
regarded
as
equivalent
to
having
intercourse
with
her
should
the
girl
happen
to
be
living
near
her
parents
at
the
moment
when
she
attained
to
puberty
she
was
expected
on
her
recovery
to
inform
them
of
the
fact
whereupon
her
father
jumped
over
her
mother
were
this
custom
omitted
the
baganda
like
the
thought
that
the
girl
would
never
have
children
or
that
they
would
die
in
infancy
thus
the
pretence
of
sexual
intercourse
between
the
parents
or
other
relatives
of
the
girl
was
a
magical
ceremony
to
ensure
her
fertility
it
is
significant
that
among
the
baganda
the
first
menstruation
was
often
called
a
marriage
and
the
girl
was
spoken
of
as
a
bride
these
terms
so
applied
point
to
a
belief
like
that
of
the
siamese
that
a
girl
s
first
menstruation
results
from
her
defloration
by
one
of
a
host
of
aerial
spirits
and
that
the
wound
thus
inflicted
is
repeated
afterwards
every
month
by
the
same
ghostly
agency
for
a
like
reason
probably
the
baganda
imagine
that
a
woman
who
does
not
menstruate
exerts
a
malign
influence
on
gardens
and
makes
them
barren
if
she
works
in
them
for
not
being
herself
fertilized
by
a
spirit
how
can
she
fertilize
the
garden
among
the
amambwe
winamwanga
alungu
and
other
tribes
of
the
great
plateau
to
the
west
of
lake
tanganyika
when
a
young
girl
knows
that
she
has
attained
puberty
she
forthwith
leaves
her
mother
s
hut
and
hides
herself
in
the
long
grass
near
the
village
covering
her
face
with
a
cloth
and
weeping
bitterly
towards
sunset
one
of
the
older
as
directress
of
the
ceremonies
is
called
her
places
a
by
the
and
boils
therein
a
concoction
of
various
herbs
with
which
she
anoints
the
neophyte
at
nightfall
the
girl
is
carried
on
the
old
woman
s
back
to
her
mother
s
hut
when
the
customary
period
of
a
few
days
has
elapsed
she
is
allowed
to
cook
again
after
first
whitewashing
the
floor
of
the
hut
but
by
the
following
month
the
preparations
for
her
initiation
are
complete
the
novice
must
remain
in
her
hut
throughout
the
whole
period
of
initiation
and
is
carefully
guarded
by
the
old
women
who
accompany
her
whenever
she
leaves
her
quarters
veiling
her
head
with
a
native
cloth
the
ceremonies
last
for
at
least
one
during
this
period
of
seclusion
drumming
and
songs
are
kept
up
within
the
mother
s
hut
by
the
village
women
and
no
male
except
it
is
said
the
father
of
twins
is
allowed
to
enter
the
directress
of
the
rites
and
the
older
women
instruct
the
young
girl
as
to
the
elementary
facts
of
life
the
duties
of
marriage
and
the
rules
of
conduct
decorum
and
hospitality
to
be
observed
by
a
married
woman
amongst
other
things
the
damsel
must
submit
to
a
series
of
tests
such
as
leaping
over
fences
thrusting
her
head
into
a
collar
made
of
thorns
and
so
on
the
lessons
which
she
receives
are
illustrated
by
mud
figures
of
animals
and
of
the
common
objects
of
domestic
life
moreover
the
directress
of
studies
embellishes
the
walls
of
the
hut
with
rude
pictures
each
with
its
special
significance
and
song
which
must
be
understood
and
learned
by
the
girl
in
the
foregoing
account
the
rule
that
a
damsel
at
puberty
may
neither
see
the
sun
nor
touch
the
ground
seems
implied
by
the
statement
that
on
the
first
discovery
of
her
condition
she
hides
in
long
grass
and
is
carried
home
after
sunset
on
the
back
of
an
old
woman
among
the
tribes
of
central
angoniland
in
british
central
africa
when
a
young
girl
finds
that
she
has
become
a
woman
she
stands
silent
by
the
pathway
leading
to
the
village
her
face
wrapt
in
her
calico
an
old
woman
finding
her
there
takes
her
off
to
a
stream
to
bathe
after
that
the
girl
is
secluded
for
six
days
in
the
old
woman
s
hut
she
eats
her
porridge
out
of
an
old
basket
and
her
relish
in
which
no
salt
is
put
from
a
potsherd
the
basket
is
afterwards
thrown
away
on
the
seventh
day
the
aged
matrons
gather
together
go
with
the
girl
to
a
stream
and
throw
her
into
the
water
in
returning
they
sing
songs
and
the
old
woman
who
directs
the
proceedings
carries
the
maiden
on
her
back
then
they
spread
a
mat
and
fetch
her
husband
and
set
the
two
down
on
the
mat
and
shave
his
head
when
it
is
dark
the
old
women
escort
the
girl
to
her
husband
s
hut
there
the
relish
is
cooking
on
the
fire
during
the
night
the
woman
rises
and
puts
some
salt
in
the
pot
next
morning
before
dawn
while
all
is
dark
and
the
villagers
have
not
yet
opened
their
doors
the
young
married
woman
goes
off
and
gives
some
of
the
relish
to
her
mother
and
to
the
old
woman
who
was
mistress
of
the
ceremony
this
relish
she
sets
down
at
the
doors
of
their
houses
and
goes
away
and
in
the
morning
when
the
sun
has
risen
and
all
is
light
in
the
village
the
two
women
open
their
doors
and
there
they
find
the
relish
with
the
salt
in
it
and
they
take
of
it
and
rub
it
on
their
feet
and
under
their
and
if
there
are
little
children
in
the
house
they
eat
of
it
and
if
the
young
wife
has
a
kinsman
who
is
absent
from
the
village
some
of
the
relish
is
put
on
a
splinter
of
bamboo
and
kept
against
his
return
that
when
he
comes
he
too
may
rub
his
feet
with
it
but
if
the
woman
finds
that
her
husband
is
impotent
she
does
not
rise
betimes
and
go
out
in
the
dark
to
lay
the
relish
at
the
doors
of
her
mother
and
the
old
woman
and
in
the
morning
when
the
sun
is
up
and
all
the
village
is
light
the
old
women
open
their
doors
and
see
no
relish
there
and
they
know
what
has
happened
and
so
they
go
wilily
to
work
for
they
persuade
the
husband
to
consult
the
diviner
that
he
may
discover
how
to
cure
his
impotence
and
while
he
is
closeted
with
the
wizard
they
fetch
another
man
who
finishes
the
ceremony
with
the
young
wife
in
order
that
the
relish
may
be
given
out
and
that
people
may
rub
their
feet
with
it
but
if
it
happens
that
when
a
girl
comes
to
maturity
she
is
not
yet
betrothed
to
any
man
and
therefore
has
no
husband
to
go
to
the
matrons
tell
her
that
she
must
go
to
a
lover
instead
and
this
is
the
custom
which
they
call
so
in
the
evening
she
takes
her
cooking
pot
and
relish
and
hies
away
to
the
quarters
of
the
young
bachelors
and
they
very
civilly
sleep
somewhere
else
that
night
and
in
the
morning
the
girl
goes
back
to
the
hut
from
the
foregoing
account
it
appears
that
among
these
tribes
no
sooner
has
a
girl
attained
to
womanhood
than
she
is
expected
and
indeed
required
to
give
proof
of
her
newly
acquired
powers
by
cohabiting
with
a
man
whether
her
husband
or
another
and
the
abstinence
from
salt
during
the
girl
s
seclusion
is
all
the
more
remarkable
because
as
soon
as
the
seclusion
is
over
she
has
to
use
salt
for
a
particular
purpose
to
which
the
people
evidently
attach
very
great
importance
since
in
the
event
of
her
husband
proving
impotent
she
is
even
compelled
apparently
to
commit
adultery
in
order
that
the
salted
relish
may
be
given
out
as
usual
in
this
connexion
it
deserves
to
be
noted
that
among
the
wagogo
of
german
east
africa
women
at
their
monthly
periods
may
not
sleep
with
their
husbands
and
may
not
put
salt
in
food
a
similar
rule
is
observed
by
the
tribes
of
central
angoniland
with
whose
puberty
customs
we
are
here
concerned
among
them
we
are
told
some
superstition
exists
with
regard
to
the
use
of
salt
a
woman
during
her
monthly
sickness
must
on
no
account
put
salt
into
any
food
she
is
cooking
lest
she
give
her
husband
or
children
a
disease
called
but
calls
a
child
to
put
it
in
or
as
the
song
goes
mchere
ni
bondo
chifukwa
n
kupanda
and
pours
in
the
salt
by
placing
it
on
her
knee
because
there
is
no
child
handy
should
a
party
of
villagers
have
gone
to
make
salt
all
sexual
intercourse
is
forbidden
among
the
people
of
the
village
until
the
people
who
have
gone
to
make
the
salt
from
grass
return
when
they
do
come
back
they
must
make
their
entry
into
the
village
at
night
and
no
one
must
see
them
then
one
of
the
elders
of
the
village
sleeps
with
his
wife
she
then
cooks
some
relish
into
which
she
puts
some
of
the
salt
this
relish
is
handed
round
to
the
people
who
went
to
make
the
salt
who
rub
it
on
their
feet
and
under
their
hence
it
would
seem
that
in
the
mind
of
these
people
abstinence
from
salt
is
somehow
associated
with
the
idea
of
chastity
the
same
association
meets
us
in
the
customs
of
many
peoples
in
various
parts
of
the
world
for
example
ancient
hindoo
ritual
prescribed
that
for
three
nights
after
a
husband
had
brought
his
bride
home
the
two
should
sleep
on
the
ground
remain
chaste
and
eat
no
salt
among
the
baganda
when
a
man
was
making
a
net
he
had
to
refrain
from
eating
salt
and
meat
and
from
living
with
his
wife
these
restrictions
he
observed
until
the
net
took
its
first
catch
of
fish
similarly
so
long
as
a
fisherman
s
nets
or
traps
were
in
the
water
he
must
live
apart
from
his
wife
and
neither
he
nor
she
nor
their
children
might
eat
salt
or
meat
evidence
of
the
same
sort
could
be
multiplied
but
without
going
into
it
further
we
may
say
that
for
some
reason
which
is
not
obvious
to
us
primitive
man
connects
salt
with
the
intercourse
of
the
sexes
and
therefore
forbids
the
use
of
that
condiment
in
a
variety
of
circumstances
in
which
he
deems
continence
necessary
or
desirable
as
there
is
nothing
which
the
savage
regards
as
a
greater
bar
between
the
sexes
than
the
state
of
menstruation
he
naturally
prohibits
the
use
of
salt
to
women
and
girls
at
their
monthly
periods
with
the
a
tribe
at
the
northern
end
of
lake
nyassa
it
is
a
rule
that
after
her
first
menstruation
a
girl
must
be
kept
apart
with
a
few
companions
of
her
own
sex
in
a
darkened
house
the
floor
is
covered
with
dry
banana
leaves
but
no
fire
may
be
lit
in
the
house
which
is
called
the
house
of
the
awasungu
that
is
of
maidens
who
have
no
when
a
girl
reaches
puberty
the
wafiomi
of
eastern
africa
hold
a
festival
at
which
they
make
a
noise
with
a
peculiar
kind
of
rattle
after
that
the
girl
remains
for
a
year
in
the
large
common
hut
where
she
occupies
a
special
compartment
screened
off
from
the
men
s
quarters
she
may
not
cut
her
hair
or
touch
food
but
is
fed
by
other
women
at
night
however
she
quits
the
hut
and
dances
with
young
men
among
the
barotse
or
marotse
of
the
upper
zambesi
when
a
girl
arrives
at
the
age
of
puberty
she
is
sent
into
the
fields
where
a
hut
is
constructed
far
from
the
village
there
with
two
or
three
companions
she
spends
a
month
returning
home
late
and
starting
before
dawn
in
order
not
to
be
seen
by
the
men
the
women
of
the
village
visit
her
bringing
food
and
honey
and
singing
and
dancing
to
amuse
her
at
the
end
of
a
month
her
husband
comes
and
fetches
her
it
is
only
after
this
ceremony
that
women
have
the
right
to
smear
themselves
with
we
may
suspect
that
the
chief
reason
why
the
girl
during
her
seclusion
may
visit
her
home
only
by
night
is
a
fear
not
so
much
lest
she
should
be
seen
by
men
as
that
she
might
be
seen
by
the
sun
among
the
wafiomi
as
we
have
just
learned
the
young
woman
in
similar
circumstances
is
even
free
to
dance
with
men
provided
always
that
the
dance
is
danced
at
night
the
ceremonies
among
the
barotse
or
marotse
are
somewhat
more
elaborate
for
a
girl
of
the
royal
family
she
is
shut
up
for
three
months
in
a
place
which
is
kept
secret
from
the
public
only
the
women
of
her
family
know
where
it
is
there
she
sits
alone
in
the
darkness
of
the
hut
waited
on
by
female
slaves
who
are
strictly
forbidden
to
speak
and
may
communicate
with
her
and
with
each
other
only
by
signs
during
all
this
time
though
she
does
nothing
she
eats
much
and
when
at
last
she
comes
forth
her
appearance
is
quite
changed
so
fat
has
she
grown
she
is
then
led
by
night
to
the
river
and
bathed
in
presence
of
all
the
women
of
the
village
next
day
she
flaunts
before
the
public
in
her
gayest
attire
her
head
bedecked
with
ornaments
and
her
face
mottled
with
red
paint
so
everybody
knows
what
has
happened
among
the
northern
clans
of
the
thonga
tribe
in
africa
about
delagoa
bay
when
a
girl
thinks
that
the
time
of
her
nubility
is
near
she
chooses
an
adoptive
mother
perhaps
in
a
neighbouring
village
when
the
symptoms
appear
she
flies
away
from
her
own
village
and
repairs
to
that
of
her
adopted
mother
to
weep
near
after
that
she
is
secluded
with
several
other
girls
in
the
same
condition
for
a
month
they
are
shut
up
in
a
hut
and
whenever
they
come
outside
they
must
wear
a
dirty
greasy
cloth
over
their
faces
as
a
veil
every
morning
they
are
led
to
a
pool
and
plunged
in
the
water
up
to
their
necks
initiated
girls
or
women
accompany
them
singing
obscene
songs
and
driving
away
with
sticks
any
man
who
meets
them
for
no
man
may
see
a
girl
during
this
time
of
seclusion
if
he
saw
her
it
is
said
that
he
would
be
struck
blind
on
their
return
from
the
river
the
girls
are
again
imprisoned
in
the
hut
where
they
remain
wet
and
shivering
for
they
may
not
go
near
the
fire
to
warm
themselves
during
their
seclusion
they
listen
to
lascivious
songs
sung
by
grown
women
and
are
instructed
in
sexual
matters
at
the
end
of
the
month
the
adoptive
mother
brings
the
girl
home
to
her
true
mother
and
presents
her
with
a
pot
of
beer
among
the
caffre
tribes
of
south
africa
the
period
of
a
girl
s
seclusion
at
puberty
varies
with
the
rank
of
her
father
if
he
is
a
rich
man
it
may
last
twelve
days
if
he
is
a
chief
it
may
last
days
and
when
it
is
over
the
girl
rubs
herself
over
with
red
earth
and
strews
finely
powdered
red
earth
on
the
ground
before
she
leaves
the
hut
where
she
has
been
shut
up
finally
though
she
was
forbidden
to
drink
milk
all
the
days
of
her
separation
she
washes
out
her
mouth
with
milk
and
is
from
that
moment
regarded
as
a
woman
afterwards
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
she
carries
away
all
the
objects
with
which
she
came
into
contact
in
the
hut
during
her
seclusion
and
buries
them
secretly
in
a
sequestered
spot
when
the
girl
is
a
chief
s
daughter
the
ceremonies
at
her
liberation
from
the
hut
are
more
elaborate
than
usual
she
is
led
forth
from
the
hut
by
a
son
of
her
father
s
councillor
who
wearing
the
wings
of
a
blue
crane
the
badge
of
bravery
on
his
head
escorts
her
to
the
cattle
kraal
where
cows
are
slaughtered
and
dancing
takes
place
large
skins
full
of
milk
are
sent
to
the
spot
from
neighbouring
villages
and
after
the
dances
are
over
the
girl
drinks
milk
for
the
first
time
since
the
day
she
entered
into
retreat
but
the
first
mouthful
is
drunk
by
the
girl
s
aunt
or
other
female
relative
who
had
charge
of
her
during
her
seclusion
and
a
little
of
it
is
poured
on
the
amongst
the
zulus
when
the
girl
was
a
princess
royal
the
end
of
her
time
of
separation
was
celebrated
by
a
sort
of
saturnalia
law
and
order
were
for
the
time
being
in
abeyance
every
man
woman
and
child
might
appropriate
any
article
of
property
the
king
abstained
from
interfering
and
if
during
this
reign
of
misrule
he
was
robbed
of
anything
he
valued
he
could
only
recover
it
by
paying
a
fine
among
the
basutos
when
girls
at
puberty
are
bathed
as
usual
by
the
matrons
in
a
river
they
are
hidden
separately
in
the
turns
and
bends
of
the
stream
and
told
to
cover
their
heads
as
they
will
be
visited
by
a
large
serpent
their
limbs
are
then
plastered
with
clay
little
masks
of
straw
are
put
on
their
faces
and
thus
arrayed
they
daily
follow
each
other
in
procession
singing
melancholy
airs
to
the
fields
there
to
learn
the
labours
of
husbandry
in
which
a
great
part
of
their
adult
life
will
be
passed
we
may
suppose
though
we
are
not
told
that
the
straw
masks
which
they
wear
in
these
processions
are
intended
to
hide
their
faces
from
the
gaze
of
men
and
the
rays
of
the
sun
among
the
tribes
in
the
lower
valley
of
the
congo
such
as
the
bavili
when
a
girl
arrives
at
puberty
she
has
to
pass
two
or
three
months
in
seclusion
in
a
small
hut
built
for
the
purpose
the
hair
of
her
head
is
shaved
off
and
every
day
the
whole
of
her
body
is
smeared
with
a
red
paint
made
from
a
powdered
wood
mixed
with
water
some
of
her
companions
reside
in
the
hut
with
her
and
prepare
the
paint
for
her
use
a
woman
is
appointed
to
take
charge
of
the
hut
and
to
keep
off
intruders
at
the
end
of
her
confinement
she
is
taken
to
water
by
the
women
of
her
family
and
bathed
the
paint
is
rubbed
off
her
body
her
arms
and
legs
are
loaded
with
brass
rings
and
she
is
led
in
solemn
procession
under
an
umbrella
to
her
husband
s
house
if
these
ceremonies
were
not
performed
the
people
believe
that
the
girl
would
be
barren
or
would
give
birth
to
monsters
that
the
rain
would
cease
to
fall
the
earth
to
bear
fruit
and
the
fishing
to
be
successful
such
serious
importance
do
these
savages
ascribe
to
the
performance
of
rites
which
to
us
seem
so
childish
seclusion
of
girls
at
puberty
in
new
ireland
new
guinea
and
indonesia
in
new
ireland
girls
are
confined
for
four
or
five
years
in
small
cages
being
kept
in
the
dark
and
not
allowed
to
set
foot
on
the
ground
the
custom
has
been
thus
described
by
an
i
heard
from
a
teacher
about
some
strange
custom
connected
with
some
of
the
young
girls
here
so
i
asked
the
chief
to
take
me
to
the
house
where
they
were
the
house
was
about
feet
in
length
and
stood
in
a
reed
and
bamboo
enclosure
across
the
entrance
to
which
a
bundle
of
dried
grass
was
suspended
to
show
that
it
was
strictly
inside
the
house
were
three
conical
structures
about
seven
or
eight
feet
in
height
and
about
ten
or
twelve
feet
in
circumference
at
the
bottom
and
for
about
four
feet
from
the
ground
at
which
point
they
tapered
off
to
a
point
at
the
top
these
cages
were
made
of
the
broad
leaves
of
the
sewn
quite
close
together
so
that
no
light
and
little
or
no
air
could
enter
on
one
side
of
each
is
an
opening
which
is
closed
by
a
double
door
of
plaited
tree
and
leaves
about
three
feet
from
the
ground
there
is
a
stage
of
bamboos
which
forms
the
floor
in
each
of
these
cages
we
were
told
there
was
a
young
woman
confined
each
of
whom
had
to
remain
for
at
least
four
or
five
years
without
ever
being
allowed
to
go
outside
the
house
i
could
scarcely
credit
the
story
when
i
heard
it
the
whole
thing
seemed
too
horrible
to
be
true
i
spoke
to
the
chief
and
told
him
that
i
wished
to
see
the
inside
of
the
cages
and
also
to
see
the
girls
that
i
might
make
them
a
present
of
a
few
beads
he
told
me
that
it
was
forbidden
for
any
men
but
their
own
relations
to
look
at
them
but
i
suppose
the
promised
beads
acted
as
an
inducement
and
so
he
sent
away
for
some
old
lady
who
had
charge
and
who
alone
is
allowed
to
open
the
doors
while
we
were
waiting
we
could
hear
the
girls
talking
to
the
chief
in
a
querulous
way
as
if
objecting
to
something
or
expressing
their
fears
the
old
woman
came
at
length
and
certainly
she
did
not
seem
a
very
pleasant
jailor
or
guardian
nor
did
she
seem
to
favour
the
request
of
the
chief
to
allow
us
to
see
the
girls
as
she
regarded
us
with
anything
but
pleasant
looks
however
she
had
to
undo
the
door
when
the
chief
told
her
to
do
so
and
then
the
girls
peeped
out
at
us
and
when
told
to
do
so
they
held
out
their
hands
for
the
beads
i
however
purposely
sat
at
some
distance
away
and
merely
held
out
the
beads
to
them
as
i
wished
to
draw
them
quite
outside
that
i
might
inspect
the
inside
of
the
cages
this
desire
of
mine
gave
rise
to
another
difficulty
as
these
girls
were
not
allowed
to
put
their
feet
to
the
ground
all
the
time
they
were
confined
in
these
places
however
they
wished
to
get
the
beads
and
so
the
old
lady
had
to
go
outside
and
collect
a
lot
of
pieces
of
wood
and
bamboo
which
she
placed
on
the
ground
and
then
going
to
one
of
the
girls
she
helped
her
down
and
held
her
hand
as
she
stepped
from
one
piece
of
wood
to
another
until
she
came
near
enough
to
get
the
beads
i
held
out
to
her
i
then
went
to
inspect
the
inside
of
the
cage
out
of
which
she
had
come
but
could
scarcely
put
my
head
inside
of
it
the
atmosphere
was
so
hot
and
stifling
it
was
clean
and
contained
nothing
but
a
few
short
lengths
of
bamboo
for
holding
water
there
was
only
room
for
the
girl
to
sit
or
lie
down
in
a
crouched
position
on
the
bamboo
platform
and
when
the
doors
are
shut
it
must
be
nearly
or
quite
dark
inside
the
girls
are
never
allowed
to
come
out
except
once
a
day
to
bathe
in
a
dish
or
wooden
bowl
placed
close
to
each
cage
they
say
that
they
perspire
profusely
they
are
placed
in
these
stifling
cages
when
quite
young
and
must
remain
there
until
they
are
young
women
when
they
are
taken
out
and
have
each
a
great
marriage
feast
provided
for
them
one
of
them
was
about
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
old
and
the
chief
told
us
that
she
had
been
there
for
five
years
but
would
soon
be
taken
out
now
the
other
two
were
about
eight
and
ten
years
old
and
they
have
to
stay
there
for
several
years
a
more
recent
observer
has
described
the
custom
as
it
is
observed
on
the
western
coast
of
new
ireland
he
says
a
is
the
name
of
a
little
house
not
larger
than
an
ordinary
in
which
a
little
girl
is
shut
up
sometimes
for
weeks
only
and
at
other
times
for
months
briefly
stated
the
custom
is
this
girls
on
attaining
puberty
or
betrothal
are
enclosed
in
one
of
these
little
coops
for
a
considerable
time
they
must
remain
there
night
and
day
we
saw
two
of
these
girls
in
two
coops
the
girls
were
not
more
than
ten
years
old
still
they
were
lying
in
a
position
as
their
little
houses
would
not
admit
of
them
lying
in
any
other
way
these
two
coops
were
inside
a
large
house
but
the
chief
in
consideration
of
a
present
of
a
couple
of
tomahawks
ordered
the
ends
to
be
torn
out
of
the
house
to
admit
the
light
so
that
we
might
photograph
the
the
occupant
was
allowed
to
put
her
face
through
an
opening
to
be
photographed
in
consideration
of
another
as
a
consequence
of
their
long
enforced
idleness
in
the
shade
the
girls
grow
fat
and
their
dusky
complexion
bleaches
to
a
more
pallid
hue
both
their
corpulence
and
their
pallor
are
regarded
as
beauties
in
kabadi
a
district
of
british
new
guinea
daughters
of
chiefs
when
they
are
about
twelve
or
thirteen
years
of
age
are
kept
indoors
for
two
or
three
years
never
being
allowed
under
any
pretence
to
descend
from
the
house
and
the
house
is
so
shaded
that
the
sun
can
not
shine
on
among
the
yabim
and
bukaua
two
neighbouring
and
kindred
tribes
on
the
coast
of
german
new
guinea
a
girl
at
puberty
is
secluded
for
some
five
or
six
weeks
in
an
inner
part
of
the
house
but
she
may
not
sit
on
the
floor
lest
her
uncleanness
should
cleave
to
it
so
a
log
of
wood
is
placed
for
her
to
squat
on
moreover
she
may
not
touch
the
ground
with
her
feet
hence
if
she
is
obliged
to
quit
the
house
for
a
short
time
she
is
muffled
up
in
mats
and
walks
on
two
halves
of
a
shell
which
are
fastened
like
sandals
to
her
feet
by
creeping
plants
during
her
seclusion
she
is
in
charge
of
her
aunts
or
other
female
relatives
at
the
end
of
the
time
she
bathes
her
person
is
loaded
with
ornaments
her
face
is
grotesquely
painted
with
red
stripes
on
a
white

thus
adorned

of
the
house
and
cut
off
from
all
intercourse
with
the
world
for
a
long
time
the
cell
like
the
rest
of
the
house
is
raised
on
piles
above
the
ground
and
is
lit
by
a
single
small
window
opening
on
a
lonely
place
so
that
the
girl
is
in
almost
total
darkness
she
may
not
leave
the
room
on
any
pretext
whatever
not
even
for
the
most
necessary
purposes
none
of
her
family
may
see
her
all
the
time
she
is
shut
up
but
a
single
slave
woman
is
appointed
to
wait
on
her
during
her
lonely
confinement
which
often
lasts
seven
years
the
girl
occupies
herself
in
weaving
mats
or
with
other
handiwork
her
bodily
growth
is
stunted
by
the
long
want
of
exercise
and
when
on
attaining

she
is
brought
out
her
complexion
is
pale
and
she
is
now
shewn

is
smeared
with

shut
up
for
several
days
in

when
the
signs
of
puberty
appear
on
a
girl
a
circle
of
bushes
is
made
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
house
here
decked
with
armlets
leglets
just
below
the

squats
in

are
piled
so
high
round
about
her
that
only
her
head
is
visible
in

state
of
seclusion
she
must
remain
for
three
months
all
this
time
the
sun
may
not
shine
upon
her
but
at
night
she
is
allowed
to
slip
out
of
the
hut
and
the
bushes
that
hedge
her
in
are
then
changed
she
may
not
feed
herself
or
handle
food
but
is
fed
by
one
or
two
old
women
her
maternal
aunts
who
are
especially
appointed
to
look
after
her
one
of
these
women
cooks
food
for
her
at
a
special
fire
in
the
forest
the
girl
is
forbidden
to
eat
turtle
or

no
vegetable
food
is
refused
her
no
man
not
even
her

father
may
come
into
the
house
while
her
seclusion
lasts
for
if
her
father
saw
her
at
this
time
he
would
certainly
have
bad
luck
in
his
fishing
and
would
probably
smash
his
canoe
the
very
next
time
he
went
out
in
it
at
the
end
of
the
three
months
she
is
carried
down
to
a
creek
by
her
attendants
hanging
on
to
their
shoulders
in
such
a
way
that
her
feet
do
not
touch
the
ground
while
the
women
of
the
tribe
form
a
ring
round
her
and
thus
escort
her
to
the
beach
arrived
at
the
shore
she
is
stripped
of
her
ornaments
and
the
bearers
stagger
with
her
into
the
creek
where
they
immerse
her
and
all
the
other
women
join
in
splashing
water
over
both
the
girl
and
her
bearers
when
they
come
out
of
the
water
one
of
the
two
attendants
makes
a
heap
of
grass
for
her
charge
to
squat
upon
the
other
runs
to
the
reef
catches
a
small
crab
tears
off
its
claws
and
hastens
back
with
them
to
the
creek
here
in
the
meantime
a
fire
has
been
kindled
and
the
claws
are
roasted
at
it
the
girl
is
then
fed
by
her
attendants
with
the
roasted
claws
after
that
she
is
freshly
decorated
and
the
whole
party
marches
back
to
the
village
in
a
single
rank
the
girl
walking
in
the
centre
between
her
two
old
aunts
who
hold
her
by
the
wrists
the
husbands
of
her
aunts
now
receive
her
and
lead
her
into
the
house
of
one
of
them
where
all
partake
of
food
and
the
girl
is
allowed
once
more
to
feed
herself
in
the
usual
manner
a
dance
follows
in
which
the
girl
takes
a
prominent
part
dancing
between
the
husbands
of
the
two
aunts
who
had
charge
of
her
in
her
retirement
among
the
yaraikanna
tribe
of
cape
york
peninsula
in
northern
queensland
a
girl
at
puberty
is
said
to
live
by
herself
for
a
month
or
six
weeks
no
man
may
see
her
though
any
woman
may
she
stays
in
a
hut
or
shelter
specially
made
for
her
on
the
floor
of
which
she
lies
supine
she
may
not
see
the
sun
and
towards
sunset
she
must
keep
her
eyes
shut
until
the
sun
has
gone
down
otherwise
it
is
thought
that
her
nose
will
be
diseased
during
her
seclusion
she
may
eat
nothing
that
lives
in
salt
water
or
a
snake
would
kill
her
an
old
woman
waits
upon
her
and
supplies
her
with
roots
yams
and
water
some
tribes
are
wont
to
bury
their
girls
at
such
seasons
more
or
less
deeply
in
the
ground
perhaps
in
order
to
hide
them
from
the
light
of
the
sun
thus
the
larrakeeyah
tribe
in
the
northern
territory
of
south
australia
used
to
cover
a
girl
up
with
dirt
for
three
days
at
her
first
monthly
period
in
similar
circumstances
the
otati
tribe
on
the
east
coast
of
the
cape
york
peninsula
make
an
excavation
in
the
ground
where
the
girl
squats
a
bower
is
then
built
over
the
hole
and
sand
is
thrown
on
the
young
woman
till
she
is
covered
up
to
the
hips
in
this
condition
she
remains
for
the
first
day
but
comes
out
at
night
so
long
as
the
period
lasts
she
stays
in
the
bower
during
the
but
is
not
again
covered
with
sand
afterwards
her
body
is
painted
red
and
white
from
the
head
to
the
hips
and
she
returns
to
the
camp
where
she
squats
first
on
the
right
side
then
on
the
left
side
and
then
on
the
lap
of
her
future
husband
who
has
been
previously
selected
for
her
among
the
natives
of
the
pennefather
river
in
the
cape
york
peninsula
queensland
when
a
girl
menstruates
for
the
first
time
her
mother
takes
her
away
from
the
camp
to
some
secluded
spot
where
she
digs
a
circular
hole
in
the
sandy
soil
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
in
this
hole
the
girl
squats
with
crossed
legs
and
is
covered
with
sand
from
the
waist
downwards
a
is
planted
firmly
in
the
sand
on
each
side
of
her
and
the
place
is
surrounded
by
a
fence
of
bushes
except
in
front
where
her
mother
kindles
a
fire
here
the
girl
stays
all
day
sitting
with
her
arms
crossed
and
the
palms
of
her
hands
resting
on
the
sand
she
may
not
move
her
arms
except
to
take
food
from
her
mother
or
to
scratch
herself
and
in
scratching
herself
she
may
not
touch
herself
with
her
own
hands
but
must
use
for
the
purpose
a
splinter
of
wood
which
when
it
is
not
in
use
is
stuck
in
her
hair
she
may
speak
to
nobody
but
her
mother
indeed
nobody
else
would
think
of
coming
near
her
at
evening
she
lays
hold
of
the
two
and
by
their
help
frees
herself
from
the
superincumbent
weight
of
sand
and
returns
to
the
camp
next
morning
she
is
again
buried
in
the
sand
under
the
shade
of
the
tree
and
remains
there
again
till
evening
this
she
does
daily
for
five
days
on
her
return
at
evening
on
the
fifth
day
her
mother
decorates
her
with
a
a
and
a
necklet
of
ties
green
parrot
feathers
round
her
arms
and
wrists
and
across
her
chest
and
smears
her
body
back
and
front
from
the
waist
upwards
with
blotches
of
red
white
and
yellow
paint
she
has
in
like
manner
to
be
buried
in
the
sand
at
her
second
and
third
menstruations
but
at
the
fourth
she
is
allowed
to
remain
in
camp
only
signifying
her
condition
by
wearing
a
basket
of
empty
shells
on
her
back
among
the
kia
blacks
of
the
prosperine
river
on
the
east
coast
of
queensland
a
girl
at
puberty
has
to
sit
or
lie
down
in
a
shallow
pit
away
from
the
camp
a
rough
hut
of
bushes
is
erected
over
her
to
protect
her
from
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
there
she
stays
for
about
a
week
waited
on
by
her
mother
and
sister
the
only
persons
to
whom
she
may
speak
she
is
allowed
to
drink
water
but
may
not
touch
it
with
her
hands
and
she
may
scratch
herself
a
little
with
a
this
seclusion
is
repeated
at
her
second
and
third
monthly
periods
but
when
the
third
is
over

seclusion
of
girls
at
puberty
among
the
indians
of
north
america
among
the
indians
of
california
a
girl
at
her
first
menstruation
was
thought
to
be
possessed
of
a
particular
degree
of
supernatural
power
and
this
was
not
always
regarded
as
entirely
defiling
or
malevolent
often
however
there
was
a
strong
feeling
of
the
power
of
evil
inherent
in
her
condition
not
only
was
she
secluded
from
her
family
and
the
community
but
an
attempt
was
made
to
seclude
the
world
from
her
one
of
the
injunctions
most
strongly
laid
upon
her
was
not
to
look
about
her
she
kept
her
head
bowed
and
was
forbidden
to
see
the
world
and
the
sun
some
tribes
covered
her
with
a
blanket
many
of
the
customs
in
this
connection
resembled
those
of
the
north
pacific
coast
most
strongly
such
as
the
prohibition
to
the
girl
to
touch
or
scratch
her
head
with
her
hand
a
special
implement
being
furnished
her
for
the
purpose
sometimes
she
could
eat
only
when
fed
and
in
other
cases
fasted
altogether
some
form
of
public
ceremony
often
accompanied
by
a
dance
and
sometimes
by
a
form
of
ordeal
for
the
girl
was
practised
nearly
everywhere
such
ceremonies
were
well
developed
in
southern
california
where
a
number
of
actions
symbolical
of
the
girl
s
maturity
and
subsequent
life
were
thus
among
the
maidu
indians
of
california
a
girl
at
puberty
remained
shut
up
in
a
small
separate
hut
for
five
days
she
might
not
eat
flesh
or
fish
nor
feed
herself
but
was
fed
by
her
mother
or
other
old
woman
she
had
a
basket
plate
and
cup
for
her
own
use
and
a
stick
with
which
to
scratch
her
head
for
she
might
not
scratch
it
with
her
fingers
at
the
end
of
five
days
she
took
a
warm
bath
and
while
she
still
remained
in
the
hut
and
plied
the
on
her
head
was
privileged
to
feed
herself
with
her
own
hands
after
five
days
more
she
bathed
in
the
river
after
which
her
parents
gave
a
great
feast
in
her
honour
at
the
feast
the
girl
was
dressed
in
her
best
and
anybody
might
ask
her
parents
for
anything
he
pleased
and
they
had
to
give
it
even
if
it
was
the
hand
of
their
daughter
in
marriage
during
the
period
of
her
seclusion
in
the
hut
the
girl
was
allowed
to
go
by
night
to
her
parents
house
and
listen
to
songs
sung
by
her
friends
and
relations
who
assembled
for
the
purpose
among
the
songs
were
some
that
related
to
the
different
roots
and
seeds
which
in
these
tribes
it
is
the
business
of
women
to
gather
for
food
while
the
singers
sang
she
sat
by
herself
in
a
corner
of
the
house
muffled
up
completely
in
mats
and
skins
no
man
or
boy
might
come
near
her
among
the
hupa
another
indian
tribe
of
california
when
a
girl
had
reached
maturity
her
male
relatives
danced
all
night
for
nine
successive
nights
while
the
girl
remained
apart
eating
no
meat
and
blindfolded
but
on
the
tenth
night
she
entered
the
house
and
took
part
in
the
last
dance
among
the
wintun
another
californian
tribe
a
girl
at
puberty
was
banished
from
the
camp
and
lived
alone
in
a
distant
booth
fasting
rigidly
from
animal
food
it
was
death
to
any
person
to
touch
or
even
approach
her
in
the
interior
of
washington
state
about
colville
the
customs
of
the
indians
in
relation
to
the
treatment
of
females
are
singular
on
the
first
appearance
of
the
menses
they
are
furnished
with
provisions
and
sent
into
the
woods
to
remain
concealed
for
two
days
for
they
have
a
superstition
that
if
a
man
should
be
seen
or
met
with
during
that
time
death
will
be
the
consequence
at
the
end
of
the
second
day
the
woman
is
permitted
to
return
to
the
lodge
when
she
is
placed
in
a
hut
just
large
enough
for
her
to
lie
in
at
full
length
in
which
she
is
compelled
to
remain
for
twenty
days
cut
off
from
all
communication
with
her
friends
and
is
obliged
to
hide
her
face
at
the
appearance
of
a
man
provisions
are
supplied
her
daily
after
this
she
is
required
to
perform
repeated
ablutions
before
she
can
resume
her
place
in
the
family
at
every
return
the
women
go
into
seclusion
for
two
or
more
among
the
chinook
indians
who
inhabited
the
coast
of
washington
state
from
shoalwater
bay
as
far
as
grey
s
harbour
when
a
chief
s
daughter
attained
to
puberty
she
was
hidden
for
five
days
from
the
view
of
the
people
she
might
not
look
at
them
nor
at
the
sky
nor
might
she
pick
berries
it
was
believed
that
if
she
were
to
look
at
the
sky
the
weather
would
be
bad
that
if
she
picked
berries
it
would
rain
and
that
when
she
hung
her
towel
of
on
a
the
tree
withered
up
at
once
she
went
out
of
the
house
by
a
separate
door
and
bathed
in
a
creek
far
from
the
village
she
fasted
for
some
days
and
for
many
days
more
she
might
not
eat
fresh
food
amongst
the
aht
or
nootka
indians
of
vancouver
island
when
girls
reach
puberty
they
are
placed
in
a
sort
of
gallery
in
the
house
and
are
there
surrounded
completely
with
mats
so
that
neither
the
sun
nor
any
fire
can
be
seen
in
this
cage
they
remain
for
several
days
water
is
given
them
but
no
food
the
longer
a
girl
remains
in
this
retirement
the
greater
honour
is
it
to
the
parents
but
she
is
disgraced
for
life
if
it
is
known
that
she
has
seen
fire
or
the
sun
during
this
initiatory
pictures
of
the
mythical
are
painted
on
the
screens
behind
which
she
hides
during
her
seclusion
she
may
neither
move
nor
lie
down
but
must
always
sit
in
a
squatting
posture
she
may
not
touch
her
hair
with
her
hands
but
is
allowed
to
scratch
her
head
with
a
comb
or
a
piece
of
bone
provided
for
the
purpose
to
scratch
her
body
is
also
forbidden
as
it
is
believed
that
every
scratch
would
leave
a
scar
for
eight
months
after
reaching
maturity
she
may
not
eat
any
fresh
food
particularly
salmon
moreover
she
must
eat
by
herself
and
use
a
cup
and
dish
of
her
own
among
the
haida
indians
of
the
queen
charlotte
islands
girls
at
puberty
were
secluded
behind
screens
in
the
house
for
about
twenty
days
in
some
parts
of
the
islands
separate
fires
were
provided
for
the
girls
and
they
went
out
and
in
by
a
separate
door
at
the
back
of
the
house
if
a
girl
at
such
a
time
was
obliged
to
go
out
by
the
front
door
all
the
weapons
medicine
and
other
articles
had
to
be
removed
from
the
house
till
her
return
for
otherwise
it
was
thought
that
they
would
be
unlucky
and
if
there
was
a
good
hunter
in
the
house
he
also
had
to
go
out
at
the
same
time
on
pain
of
losing
his
good
luck
if
he
remained
during
several
months
or
even
half
a
year
the
girl
was
bound
to
wear
a
peculiar
cloak
or
hood
made
of
nearly
conical
in
shape
and
reaching
down
below
the
breast
but
open
before
the
face
after
the
twenty
days
were
over
the
girl
took
a
bath
none
of
the
water
might
be
spilled
it
had
all
to
be
taken
back
to
the
woods
else
the
girl
would
not
live
long
on
the
west
coast
of
the
islands
the
damsel
might
eat
nothing
but
black
cod
for
four
years
for
the
people
believed
that
other
kinds
of
fish
would
become
scarce
if
she
partook
of
them
at
kloo
the
young
woman
at
such
times
was
forbidden
to
look
at
the
sea
and
for
forty
days
she
might
not
gaze
at
the
fire
for
a
whole
year
she
might
not
walk
on
the
beach
below
mark
because
then
the
tide
would
come
in
covering
part
of
the
food
supply
and
there
would
be
bad
weather
for
five
years
she
might
not
eat
salmon
or
the
fish
would
be
scarce
and
when
her
family
went
to
a
she
landed
from
the
canoe
at
the
mouth
of
the
creek
and
came
to
the
from
behind
for
were
she
to
see
a
salmon
leap
all
the
salmon
might
leave
the
creek
among
the
haidas
of
masset
it
was
believed
that
if
the
girl
looked
at
the
sky
the
weather
would
be
bad
and
that
if
she
stepped
over
a
all
the
salmon
would
disappear
amongst
the
tlingit
thlinkeet
or
kolosh
indians
of
alaska
when
a
girl
shewed
signs
of
womanhood
she
used
to
be
confined
to
a
little
hut
or
cage
which
was
completely
blocked
up
with
the
exception
of
a
small
in
this
dark
and
filthy
abode
she
had
to
remain
a
year
without
fire
exercise
or
associates
only
her
mother
and
a
female
slave
might
supply
her
with
nourishment
her
food
was
put
in
at
the
little
window
she
had
to
drink
out
of
the
of
a
eagle
the
time
of
her
seclusion
was
afterwards
reduced
in
some
places
to
six
or
three
months
or
even
less
she
had
to
wear
a
sort
of
hat
with
long
flaps
that
her
gaze
might
not
pollute
the
sky
for
she
was
thought
unfit
for
the

to
shine
upon
and
it
was
imagined
that
her
look
would
destroy
the
luck
of

or
gambler

things
to
stone
and
do
other
mischief
at
the
end
of

confinement
her
old
clothes
were
burnt
new
ones
were
made
and
a
feast
was
given
at
which
a
slit
was
cut
in
her
under
lip
parallel
to
the

of

from
becoming

girls
verging
on
maturity
that
is
when
their
breasts
begin
to
form
take
swans
feathers
mixed
with
human
hair
and
plait
bands
which
they
tie
round
their
wrists
and
ankles
to
secure
long
life
at
this
time
they
are
careful
that
the
dishes
out
of
which
they
eat
are
used
by
no
other
person
and
wholly
devoted
to
their
own
use
during
this
period
they
eat
nothing
but
dog
fish
and
starvation
will
drive
them
to
eat
either
fresh
fish
or
meat
when
their
first
periodical
sickness
comes
on
they
are
fed
by
their
mothers
or
nearest
female
relation
by
and
on
no
account
will
they
touch
their
food
with
their
own
hands
they
are
at
this
time
also
careful
not
to
touch
their
heads
with
their
hands
and
keep
a
small
stick
to
scratch
their
heads
with
they
remain
outside
the
lodge
all
the
time
they
are
in
this
state
in
a
hut
made
for
the
purpose
during
all
this
period
they
wear
a
made
of
skin
to
fit
very
tight
this
is
never
taken
off
until
their
first
monthly
sickness
ceases
they
also
wear
a
strip
of
black
paint
about
one
inch
wide
across
their
eyes
and
wear
a
fringe
of
shells
bones
hanging
down
from
their
foreheads
to
below
their
eyes
and
this
is
never
taken
off
till
the
second
monthly
period
arrives
and
ceases
when
the
nearest
male
relative
makes
a
feast
after
which
she
is
considered
a
fully
matured
woman
but
she
has
to
refrain
from
eating
anything
fresh
for
one
year
after
her
first
monthly
sickness
she
may
however
eat
partridge
but
it
must
be
cooked
in
the
crop
of
the
bird
to
render
it
harmless
i
would
have
thought
it
impossible
to
perform
this
feat
had
i
not
seen
it
done
the
crop
is
blown
out
and
a
small
bent
willow
put
round
the
mouth
it
is
then
filled
with
water
and
the
meat
being
first
minced
up
put
in
also
then
put
on
the
fire
and
boiled
till
cooked
their
reason
for
hanging
fringes
before
their
eyes
is
to
hinder
any
bad
medicine
man
from
harming
them
during
this
critical
period
they
are
very
careful
not
to
drink
whilst
facing
a
medicine
man
and
do
so
only
when
their
backs
are
turned
to
him
all
these
habits
are
left
off
when
the
girl
is
a
recognised
woman
with
the
exception
of
their
going
out
of
the
lodge
and
remaining
in
a
hut
every
time
their
periodical
sickness
comes
on
this
is
a
rigidly
observed
law
with
both
single
and
married
among
the
hareskin
tinneh
a
girl
at
puberty
was
secluded
for
five
days
in
a
hut
made
specially
for
the
purpose
she
might
only
drink
out
of
a
tube
made
from
a
swan
s
bone
and
for
a
month
she
might
not
break
a
hare
s
bones
nor
taste
blood
nor
eat
the
heart
or
fat
of
animals
nor
birds
eggs
among
the
tinneh
indians
of
the
middle
yukon
valley
in
alaska
the
period
of
the
girl
s
seclusion
lasts
exactly
a
lunar
month
for
the
day
of
the
moon
on
which
the
symptoms
first
occur
is
noted
and
she
is
sequestered
until
the
same
day
of
the
next
moon
if
the
season
is
winter
a
corner
of
the
house
is
curtained
off
for
her
use
by
a
blanket
or
a
sheet
of
canvas
if
it
is
summer
a
small
tent
is
erected
for
her
near
the
common
one
here
she
lives
and
sleeps
she
wears
a
long
robe
and
a
large
hood
which
she
must
pull
down
over
her
eyes
whenever
she
leaves
the
hut
and
she
must
keep
it
down
till
she
returns
she
may
not
speak
to
a
man
nor
see
his
face
much
less
touch
his
clothes
or
anything
that
belongs
to
him
for
if
she
did
so
though
no
harm
would
come
to
her
he
would
grow
unmanly
she
has
her
own
dishes
for
eating
out
of
and
may
use
no
other
at
kaltag
she
must
suck
the
water
through
a
swan
s
bone
without
applying
her
lips
to
the
cup
she
may
eat
no
fresh
meat
or
fish
except
the
flesh
of
the
porcupine
she
may
not
undress
but
sleeps
with
all
her
clothes
on
even
her
mittens
in
her
socks
she
wears
next
to
the
skin
the
horny
soles
cut
from
the
feet
of
a
porcupine
in
order
that
for
the
rest
of
her
life
her
shoes
may
never
wear
out
round
her
waist
she
wears
a
cord
to
which
are
tied
the
heads
of
femurs
of
a
porcupine
because
of
all
animals
known
to
the
tinneh
the
porcupine
suffers
least
in
parturition
it
simply
drops
its
young
and
continues
to
walk
or
skip
about
as
if
nothing
had
happened
hence
it
is
easy
to
see
that
a
girl
who
wears
these
portions
of
a
porcupine
about
her
waist
will
be
delivered
just
as
easily
as
the
animal
to
make
quite
sure
of
this
if
anybody
happens
to
kill
a
porcupine
big
with
young
while
the
girl
is
undergoing
her
period
of
separation
the
foetus
is
given
to
her
and
she
lets
it
slide
down
between
her
shirt
and
her
body
so
as
to
fall
on
the
ground
like
an
infant
here
the
imitation
of
childbirth
is
a
piece
of
homoeopathic
or
imitative
magic
designed
to
facilitate
the
effect
which
it
simulates
among
the
thompson
indians
of
british
columbia
when
a
girl
attained
puberty
she
was
at
once
separated
from
all
the
people
a
conical
hut
of
fir
branches
and
bark
was
erected
at
some
little
distance
from
the
other
houses
and
in
it
the
girl
had
to
squat
on
her
heels
during
the
day
often
a
deep
circular
hole
was
dug
in
the
hut
and
the
girl
squatted
in
the
hole
with
her
head
projecting
above
the
surface
of
the
ground
she
might
quit
the
hut
for
various
purposes
in
the
early
morning
but
had
always
to
be
back
at
sunrise
on
the
first
appearance
of
the
symptoms
her
face
was
painted
red
all
over
and
the
paint
was
renewed
every
morning
during
her
term
of
seclusion
a
heavy
blanket
swathed
her
body
from
top
to
toe
and
during
the
first
four
days
she
wore
a
conical
cap
made
of
small
fir
branches
which
reached
below
the
breast
but
left
an
opening
for
the
face
in
her
hair
was
fastened
an
implement
made
of
with
which
she
scratched
herself
for
the
first
four
days
she
might
neither
wash
nor
eat
but
a
little
water
was
given
her
in
a
cup
painted
red
and
she
sucked
up
the
liquid
through
a
tube
made
out
of
the
leg
of
a
crane
a
swan
or
a
goose
for
her
lips
might
not
touch
the
surface
of
the
water
after
the
four
days
she
was
allowed
during
the
rest
of
the
period
of
isolation
to
eat
to
wash
to
lie
down
to
comb
her
hair
and
to
drink
of
streams
and
springs
but
in
drinking
at
these
sources
she
had
still
to
use
her
tube
otherwise
the
spring
would
dry
up
while
her
seclusion
lasted
she
performed
by
night
various
ceremonies
which
were
supposed
to
exert
a
beneficial
influence
on
her
future
life
for
example
she
ran
as
fast
as
she
could
praying
at
the
same
time
to
the
earth
or
nature
that
she
might
be
fleet
of
foot
and
tireless
of
limb
she
dug
trenches
in
order
that
in
after
life
she
might
be
able
to
dig
well
and
to
work
hard
these
and
other
ceremonies
she
repeated
for
four
nights
or
mornings
in
succession
four
times
each
morning
and
each
time
she
supplicated
the
dawn
of
the
day
among
the
lower
thompson
indians
she
carried
a
staff
for
one
night
and
when
the
day
was
breaking
she
leaned
the
staff
against
the
stump
of
a
tree
and
prayed
to
the
dawn
that
she
might
be
blessed
with
a
good
husband
who
was
symbolized
by
the
staff
she
also
wandered
some
nights
to
lonely
parts
of
the
mountains
where
she
would
dance
imploring
the
spirits
to
pity
and
protect
her
during
her
future
life
then
the
dance
and
prayer
over
she
would
lie
down
on
the
spot
and
fall
asleep
again
she
carried
four
stones
in
her
bosom
to
a
spring
where
she
spat
upon
the
stones
and
threw
them
one
after
the
other
into
the
water
praying
that
all
disease
might
leave
her
as
these
stones
did
also
she
ran
four
times
in
the
early
morning
with
two
small
stones
in
her
bosom
and
as
she
ran
the
stones
slipped
down
between
her
bare
body
and
her
clothes
and
fell
to
the
ground
at
the
same
time
she
prayed
to
the
dawn
that
when
she
should
be
with
child
she
might
be
delivered
as
easily
as
she
was
delivered
of
these
stones
but
whatever
exercises
she
performed
or
prayers
she
offered
on
the
lonely
mountains
during
the
hours
of
darkness
or
while
the
morning
light
was
growing
in
the
east
she
must
always
be
back
in
her
little
hut
before
the
sun
rose
there
she
often
passed
the
tedious
hours
away
picking
the
needles
one
by
one
from
the
cones
on
two
large
branches
of
fir
which
hung
from
the
roof
of
her
hut
on
purpose
to
provide
her
with
occupation
and
as
she
picked
she
prayed
to
the
that
she
might
never
be
lazy
but
always
quick
and
active
at
work
during
her
seclusion
too
she
had
to
make
miniatures
of
all
the
articles
that
indian
women
make
or
used
to
make
such
as
baskets
mats
ropes
and
thread
this
she
did
in
order
that
afterwards
she
might
be
able
to
make
the
real
things
properly
four
large
also
were
placed
in
front
of
the
hut
so
that
when
she
went
out
or
in
she
had
to
step
over
them
the
branches
were
renewed
every
morning
and
the
old
ones
thrown
away
into
the
water
while
the
girl
prayed
may
i
never
bewitch
any
man
nor
my
may
it
never
happen
the
first
four
times
that
she
went
out
and
in
she
prayed
to
the
saying
if
ever
i
step
into
trouble
or
difficulties
or
step
unknowingly
inside
the
magical
spell
of
some
person
may
you
help
me
o
with
your
power
every
day
she
painted
her
face
afresh
and
she
wore
strings
of
parts
of
round
her
ankles
and
knees
and
tied
to
her
waistband
on
either
side
which
rattled
when
she
walked
or
ran
even
the
shape
of
the
hut
in
which
she
lived
was
adapted
to
her
future
rather
than
to
her
present
needs
and
wishes
if
she
wished
to
be
tall
the
hut
was
tall
if
she
wished
to
be
short
it
was
low
sometimes
so
low
that
there
was
not
room
in
it
for
her
to
stand
erect
and
she
would
lay
the
palm
of
her
hand
on
the
top
of
her
head
and
pray
to
the
dawn
that
she
might
grow
no
taller
her
seclusion
lasted
four
months
the
indians
say
that
long
ago
it
extended
over
a
year
and
that
fourteen
days
elapsed
before
the
girl
was
permitted
to
wash
for
the
first
time
the
dress
which
she
wore
during
her
time
of
separation
was
afterwards
taken
to
the
top
of
a
hill
and
burned
and
the
rest
of
her
clothes
were
hung
up
on
trees
among
the
lillooet
indians
of
british
columbia
neighbours
of
the
thompsons
the
customs
observed
by
girls
at
puberty
were
similar
the
damsels
were
secluded
for
a
period
of
not
less
than
one
year
nor
more
than
four
years
according
to
their
own
inclination
and
the
wishes
of
their
parents
among
the
upper
lillooets
the
hut
in
which
the
girl
lodged
was
made
of
bushy
set
up
like
a
conical
tent
the
inner
branches
being
lopped
off
while
the
outer
branches
were
closely
interwoven
and
padded
to
form
a
roof
every
month
or
the
hut
was
shifted
to
another
site
or
a
new
one
erected
by
day
the
girl
sat
in
the
hut
for
the
first
month
she
squatted
in
a
hole
dug
in
the
middle
of
it
and
she
passed
the
time
making
miniature
baskets
of
and
other
things
praying
that
she
might
be
able
to
make
the
real
things
well
in
after
years
at
the
dusk
of
the
evening
she
left
the
hut
and
wandered
about
all
night
but
she
returned
before
the
sun
rose
before
she
quitted
the
hut
at
nightfall
to
roam
abroad
she
painted
her
face
red
and
put
on
a
mask
of
and
in
her
hand
as
she
walked
she
carried
a
to
frighten
ghosts
and
guard
herself
from
evil
among
the
lower
lillooets
the
girl
s
mask
was
often
made
of
covering
her
head
neck
shoulders
and
breast
and
leaving
only
a
narrow
opening
from
the
brow
to
the
chin
during
the
nocturnal
hours
she
performed
many
ceremonies
thus
she
put
two
smooth
stones
in
her
bosom
and
ran
and
as
they
fell
down
between
her
body
and
her
clothes
she
prayed
saying
may
i
always
have
easy
now
one
of
these
stones
represented
her
future
child
and
the
other
represented
the
afterbirth
also
she
dug
trenches
praying
that
in
the
years
to
come
she
might
be
strong
and
tireless
in
digging
roots
she
picked
leaves
and
needles
from
the
praying
that
her
fingers
might
be
nimble
in
picking
berries
and
she
tore
sheets
of
into
shreds
dropping
the
shreds
as
she
walked
and
asking
that
her
hands
might
never
tire
and
that
she
might
make
neat
and
fine
work
of
moreover
she
ran
and
walked
much
that
she
might
be
light
of
foot
and
every
evening
when
the
shadows
were
falling
and
every
morning
when
the
day
was
breaking
she
prayed
to
the
dusk
of
the
evening
or
to
the
dawn
of
day
saying
o
dawn
of
day
or
o
dusk
as
it
might
be
may
i
be
able
to
dig
roots
fast
and
easily
and
may
i
always
find
plenty
all
her
prayers
were
addressed
to
the
dusk
of
the
evening
or
the
dawn
of
day
she
supplicated
both
asking
for
long
life
health
wealth
and
happiness
among
the
shuswap
indians
of
british
columbia
who
are
neighbours
of
the
thompsons
and
lillooets
a
girl
on
reaching
maturity
has
to
go
through
a
great
number
of
ceremonies
she
must
leave
the
village
and
live
alone
in
a
small
hut
on
the
mountains
she
cooks
her
own
food
and
must
not
eat
anything
that
bleeds
she
is
forbidden
to
touch
her
head
for
which
purpose
she
uses
a
comb
with
three
points
neither
is
she
allowed
to
scratch
her
body
except
with
a
painted
she
wears
the
bone
and
the
comb
suspended
from
her
belt
she
drinks
out
of
a
painted
cup
of
and
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
quantity
it
holds
every
night
she
walks
about
her
hut
and
plants
willow
twigs
which
she
has
painted
and
to
the
ends
of
which
she
has
attached
pieces
of
cloth
into
the
ground
it
is
believed
that
thus
she
will
become
rich
in
later
life
in
order
to
become
strong
she
should
climb
trees
and
try
to
break
off
their
points
she
plays
with
sticks
that
her
future
husbands
might
have
good
luck
when
during
the
day
the
girl
stays
in
her
hut
and
occupies
herself
in
making
miniature
bags
mats
and
baskets
in
sewing
and
embroidery
in
manufacturing
thread
twine
and
so
forth
in
short
she
makes
a
beginning
of
all
kinds
of
woman
s
work
in
order
that
she
may
be
a
good
housewife
in
after
life
by
night
she
roams
the
mountains
and
practises
running
climbing
carrying
burdens
and
digging
trenches
so
that
she
may
be
expert
at
digging
roots
if
she
has
wandered
far
and
daylight
overtakes
her
she
hides
herself
behind
a
veil
of
fir
branches
for
no
one
except
her
instructor
or
nearest
relatives
should
see
her
face
during
her
period
of
seclusion
she
wore
a
large
robe
painted
red
on
the
breast
and
sides
and
her
hair
was
done
up
in
a
knot
at
each
ear
ceremonies
of
the
same
general
type
were
probably
observed
by
girls
at
puberty
among
all
the
indian
tribes
of
north
america
but
the
record
of
them
is
far
less
full
for
the
central
and
eastern
tribes
perhaps
because
the
settlers
who
first
came
into
contact
with
the
red
man
in
these
regions
were
too
busy
fighting
him
to
find
leisure
even
if
they
had
the
desire
to
study
his
manners
and
customs
however
among
the
delaware
indians
a
tribe
in
the
extreme
east
of
the
continent
we
read
that
when
a
delaware
girl
has
her
first
monthly
period
she
must
withdraw
into
a
hut
at
some
distance
from
the
village
her
head
is
wrapped
up
for
twelve
days
so
that
she
can
see
nobody
and
she
must
submit
to
frequent
vomits
and
fasting
and
abstain
from
all
labor
after
this
she
is
washed
and
new
clothed
but
confined
to
a
solitary
life
for
two
months
at
the
close
of
which
she
is
declared
again
among
the
cheyennes
an
indian
tribe
of
the
missouri
valley
a
girl
at
her
first
menstruation
is
painted
red
all
over
her
body
and
secluded
in
a
special
little
lodge
for
four
days
however
she
may
remain
in
her
father
s
lodge
provided
that
there
are
no
charms
medicine
no
sacred
bundle
and
no
shield
in
it
or
that
these
and
all
other
objects
invested
with
a
sacred
character
have
been
removed
for
four
days
she
may
not
eat
boiled
meat
the
flesh
of
which
she
partakes
must
be
roasted
over
coals
young
men
will
not
eat
from
the
dish
nor
drink
from
the
pot
which
has
been
used
by
her
because
they
believe
that
were
they
to
do
so
they
would
be
wounded
in
the
next
fight
she
may
not
handle
nor
even
touch
any
weapon
of
war
or
any
sacred
object
if
the
camp
moves
she
may
not
ride
a
horse
but
is
mounted
on
a
mare
among
the
esquimaux
also
in
the
extreme
north
of
the
continent
who
belong
to
an
entirely
different
race
from
the
indians
the
attainment
of
puberty
in
the
female
sex
is
or
used
to
be
the
occasion
of
similar
observances
thus
among
the
koniags
an
esquimau
people
of
alaska
a
girl
at
puberty
was
placed
in
a
small
hut
in
which
she
had
to
remain
on
her
hands
and
knees
for
six
months
then
the
hut
was
enlarged
a
little
so
as
to
allow
her
to
straighten
her
back
but
in
this
posture
she
had
to
remain
for
six
months
more
all
this
time
she
was
regarded
as
an
unclean
being
with
whom
no
one
might
hold
intercourse
at
the
end
of
the
year
she
was
received
back
by
her
parents
and
a
great
feast
held
again
among
the
malemut
and
southward
from
the
lower
yukon
and
adjacent
districts
when
a
girl
reaches
the
age
of
puberty
she
is
considered
unclean
for
forty
days
and
must
therefore
live
by
herself
in
a
corner
of
the
house
with
her
face
to
the
wall
always
keeping
her
hood
over
her
head
and
her
hair
hanging
dishevelled
over
her
eyes
but
if
it
is
summer
she
commonly
lives
in
a
rough
shelter
outside
the
house
she
may
not
go
out
by
day
and
only
once
at
night
when
every
one
else
is
asleep
at
the
end
of
the
period
she
bathes
and
is
clothed
in
new
garments
whereupon
she
may
be
taken
in
marriage
during
her
seclusion
she
is
supposed
to
be
enveloped
in
a
peculiar
atmosphere
of
such
a
sort
that
were
a
young
man
to
come
near
enough
for
it
to
touch
him
it
would
render
him
visible
to
every
animal
he
might
hunt
so
that
his
luck
as
a
hunter
would
be
gone
seclusion
of
girls
at
puberty
among
the
indians
of
south
america
when
symptoms
of
puberty
appeared
on
a
girl
for
the
first
time
the
guaranis
of
southern
brazil
on
the
borders
of
paraguay
used
to
sew
her
up
in
her
hammock
leaving
only
a
small
opening
in
it
to
allow
her
to
breathe
in
this
condition
wrapt
up
and
shrouded
like
a
corpse
she
was
kept
for
two
or
three
days
or
so
long
as
the
symptoms
lasted
and
during
this
time
she
had
to
observe
a
most
rigorous
fast
after
that
she
was
entrusted
to
a
matron
who
cut
the
girl
s
hair
and
enjoined
her
to
abstain
most
strictly
from
eating
flesh
of
any
kind
until
her
hair
should
be
grown
long
enough
to
hide
her
ears
meanwhile
the
diviners
drew
omens
of
her
future
character
from
the
various
birds
or
animals
that
flew
past
or
crossed
her
path
if
they
saw
a
parrot
they
would
say
she
was
a
chatterbox
if
an
owl
she
was
lazy
and
useless
for
domestic
labours
and
so
on
in
similar
circumstances
the
chiriguanos
of
bolivia
hoisted
the
girl
in
her
hammock
to
the
roof
where
she
stayed
for
a
month
the
second
month
the
hammock
was
let
down
from
the
roof
and
in
the
third
month
old
women
armed
with
sticks
entered
the
hut
and
ran
about
striking
everything
they
met
saying
they
were
hunting
the
snake
that
had
wounded
the
girl
the
lengua
indians
of
the
paraguayan
chaco
under
similar
circumstances
hang
the
girl
in
her
hammock
from
the
roof
of
the
house
but
they
leave
her
there
only
three
days
and
nights
during
which
they
give
her
nothing
to
eat
but
a
little
paraguay
tea
or
boiled
maize
only
her
mother
or
grandmother
has
access
to
her
nobody
else
approaches
or
speaks
to
her
if
she
is
obliged
to
leave
the
hammock
for
a
little
her
friends
take
great
care
to
prevent
her
from
touching
the
which
is
an
imaginary
serpent
that
would
swallow
her
up
she
must
also
be
very
careful
not
to
set
foot
on
the
droppings
of
fowls
or
animals
else
she
would
suffer
from
sores
on
the
throat
and
breast
on
the
third
day
they
let
her
down
from
the
hammock
cut
her
hair
and
make
her
sit
in
a
corner
of
the
room
with
her
face
turned
to
the
wall
she
may
speak
to
nobody
and
must
abstain
from
flesh
and
fish
these
rigorous
observances
she
must
practise
for
nearly
a
year
many
girls
die
or
are
injured
for
life
in
consequence
of
the
hardships
they
endure
at
this
time
their
only
occupations
during
their
seclusion
are
spinning
and
weaving
among
the
yuracares
an
indian
tribe
of
bolivia
at
the
eastern
foot
of
the
andes
when
a
girl
perceives
the
signs
of
puberty
she
informs
her
parents
the
mother
weeps
and
the
father
constructs
a
little
hut
of
palm
leaves
near
the
house
in
this
cabin
he
shuts
up
his
daughter
so
that
she
can
not
see
the
light
and
there
she
remains
fasting
rigorously
for
four
days
meantime
the
mother
assisted
by
the
women
of
the
neighbourhood
has
brewed
a
large
quantity
of
the
native
intoxicant
called
and
poured
it
into
wooden
troughs
and
palm
leaves
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
three
hours
before
the
dawn
the
girl
s
father
having
arrayed
himself
in
his
savage
finery
summons
all
his
neighbours
with
loud
cries
the
damsel
is
seated
on
a
stone
and
every
guest
in
turn
cuts
off
a
lock
of
her
hair
and
running
away
hides
it
in
the
hollow
trunk
of
a
tree
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
when
they
have
all
done
so
and
seated
themselves
again
gravely
in
the
circle
the
girl
offers
to
each
of
them
a
calabash
full
of
very
strong
before
the
wassailing
begins
the
various
fathers
perform
a
curious
operation
on
the
arms
of
their
sons
who
are
seated
beside
them
the
operator
takes
a
very
sharp
bone
of
an
ape
rubs
it
with
a
pungent
spice
and
then
pinching
up
the
skin
of
his
son
s
arm
he
pierces
it
with
the
bone
through
and
through
as
a
surgeon
might
introduce
a
seton
this
operation
he
repeats
till
the
young
man
s
arm
is
riddled
with
holes
at
regular
intervals
from
the
shoulder
to
the
wrist
almost
all
who
take
part
in
the
festival
are
covered
with
these
wounds
which
the
indians
call
having
thus
prepared
themselves
to
spend
a
happy
day
they
drink
play
on
flutes
sing
and
dance
till
evening
rain
thunder
and
lightning
should
they
befall
have
no
effect
in
damping
the
general
enjoyment
or
preventing
its
continuance
till
after
the
sun
has
set
the
motive
for
perforating
the
arms
of
the
young
men
is
to
make
them
skilful
hunters
at
each
perforation
the
sufferer
is
cheered
by
the
promise
of
another
sort
of
game
or
fish
which
the
surgical
operation
will
infallibly
procure
for
him
the
same
operation
is
performed
on
the
arms
and
legs
of
the
girls
in
order
that
they
may
be
brave
and
strong
even
the
dogs
are
operated
on
with
the
intention
of
making
them
run
down
the
game
better
for
five
or
six
months
afterwards
the
damsel
must
cover
her
head
with
bark
and
refrain
from
speaking
to
men
the
yuracares
think
that
if
they
did
not
submit
a
young
girl
to
this
severe
ordeal
her
children
would
afterwards
perish
by
accidents
of
various
kinds
such
as
the
sting
of
a
serpent
the
bite
of
a
jaguar
the
fall
of

by

in

screened
off
with

not

lift
up

very
early
in

and
again
after

interval

corner
on

woman

young
woman
in
similar
circumstances
is
hung
in

hammock
from
the
roof
and
has
to
fast
there
for
a
month
or
as
long
as
she
can
hold
out
one
of
the
early
settlers
in
brazil
about
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
has
described
the
severe
ordeal
which
damsels
at
puberty
had
to
undergo
among
the
indians
on
the
coast
of
that
country
near
what
is
now
rio
de
janeiro
when
a
girl
had
reached
this
critical
period
of
life
her
hair
was
burned
or
shaved
off
close
to
the
head
then
she
was
placed
on
a
flat
stone
and
cut
with
the
tooth
of
an
animal
from
the
shoulders
all
down
the
back
till
she
ran
with
blood
next
the
ashes
of
a
wild
gourd
were
rubbed
into
the
wounds
the
girl
was
bound
hand
and
foot
and
hung
in
a
hammock
being
enveloped
in
it
so
closely
that
no
one
could
see
her
here
she
had
to
stay
for
three
days
without
eating
or
drinking
when
the
three
days
were
over
she
stepped
out
of
the
hammock
upon
the
flat
stone
for
her
feet
might
not
touch
the
ground
if
she
had
a
call
of
nature
a
female
relation
took
the
girl
on
her
back
and
carried
her
out
taking
with
her
a
live
coal
to
prevent
evil
influences
from
entering
the
girl
s
body
being
replaced
in
her
hammock
she
was
now
allowed
to
get
some
flour
boiled
roots
and
water
but
might
not
taste
salt
or
flesh
thus
she
continued
to
the
end
of
the
first
monthly
period
at
the
expiry
of
which
she
was
gashed
on
the
breast
and
belly
as
well
as
all
down
the
back
during
the
second
month
she
still
stayed
in
her
hammock
but
her
rule
of
abstinence
was
less
rigid
and
she
was
allowed
to
spin
the
third
month
she
was
blackened
with
a
certain
pigment
and
began
to
go
about
as
usual
amongst
the
macusis
of
british
guiana
when
a
girl
shews
the
first
signs
of
puberty
she
is
hung
in
a
hammock
at
the
highest
point
of
the
hut
for
the
first
few
days
she
may
not
leave
the
hammock
by
day
but
at
night
she
must
come
down
light
a
fire
and
spend
the
night
beside
it
else
she
would
break
out
in
sores
on
her
neck
throat
and
other
parts
of
her
body
so
long
as
the
symptoms
are
at
their
height
she
must
fast
rigorously
when
they
have
abated
she
may
come
down
and
take
up
her
abode
in
a
little
compartment
that
is
made
for
her
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
hut
in
the
morning
she
may
cook
her
food
but
it
must
be
at
a
separate
fire
and
in
a
vessel
of
her
own
after
about
ten
days
the
magician
comes
and
undoes
the
spell
by
muttering
charms
and
breathing
on
her
and
on
the
more
valuable
of
the
things
with
which
she
has
come
in
contact
the
pots
and
which
she
used
are
broken
and
the
fragments
buried
after
her
first
bath
the
girl
must
submit
to
be
beaten
by
her
mother
with
thin
rods
without
uttering
a
cry
at
the
end
of
the
second
period
she
is
again
beaten
but
not
afterwards
she
is
now
clean
and
can
mix
again
with
people
other
indians
of
guiana
after
keeping
the
girl
in
her
hammock
at
the
top
of
the
hut
for
a
month
expose
her
to
certain
large
ants
whose
bite
is
very
painful
sometimes
in
addition
to
being
stung
with
ants
the
sufferer
has
to
fast
day
and
night
so
long
as
she
remains
slung
up
on
high
in
her
hammock
so
that
when
she
comes
down
she
is
reduced
to
a
skeleton
the
intention
of
stinging
her
with
ants
is
said
to
be
to
make
her
strong
to
bear
the
burden
of
maternity
amongst
the
uaupes
of
brazil
a
girl
at
puberty
is
secluded
in
the
house
for
a
month
and
allowed
only
a
small
quantity
of
bread
and
water
then
she
is
taken
out
into
the
midst
of
her
relations
and
friends
each
of
whom
gives
her
four
or
five
blows
with
pieces
of
an
elastic
climber
till
she
falls
senseless
or
dead
if
she
recovers
the
operation
is
repeated
four
times
at
intervals
of
six
hours
and
it
is
considered
an
offence
to
the
parents
not
to
strike
hard
meantime
pots
of
meats
and
fish
have
been
made
ready
the
are
dipped
into
them
and
then
given
to
the
girl
to
lick
who
is
now
considered
a
marriageable
woman
the
custom
of
stinging
the
girl
at
such
times
with
ants
or
beating
her
with
rods
is
intended
we
may
be
sure
not
as
a
punishment
or
a
test
of
endurance
but
as
a
purification
the
object
being
to
drive
away
the
malignant
influences
with
which
a
girl
in
this
condition
is
believed
to
be
beset
and
enveloped
examples
of
purification
by
beating
by
incisions
in
the
flesh
and
by
stinging
with
ants
have
already
come
before
us
in
some
indian
tribes
of
brazil
and
guiana
young
men
do
not
rank
as
warriors
and
may
not
marry
till
they
have
passed
through
a
terrible
ordeal
which
consists
in
being
stung
by
swarms
of
venomous
ants
whose
bite
is
like
fire
thus
among
the
mauhes
on
the
tapajos
river
a
southern
tributary
of
the
amazon
boys
of
eight
to
ten
years
are
obliged
to
thrust
their
arms
into
sleeves
stuffed
with
great
ferocious
ants
which
the
indians
call
when
the
young
victim
shrieks
with
pain
an
excited
mob
of
men
dances
round
him
shouting
and
encouraging
him
till
he
falls
exhausted
to
the
ground
he
is
then
committed
to
the
care
of
old
women
who
treat
his
fearfully
swollen
arms
with
fresh
juice
of
the
manioc
and
on
his
recovery
he
has
to
shew
his
strength
and
skill
in
bending
a
bow
this
cruel
ordeal
is
commonly
repeated
again
and
again
till
the
lad
has
reached
his
fourteenth
year
and
can
bear
the
agony
without
betraying
any
sign
of
emotion
then
he
is
a
man
and
can
marry
a
lad
s
age
is
reckoned
by
the
number
of
times
he
has
passed
through
the
ordeal
an
has
described
how
a
young
mauhe
hero
bore
the
torture
with
an
endurance
more
than
spartan
dancing
and
singing
with
his
arms
cased
in
the
terrible
mittens
before
every
cabin
of
the
great
common
house
till
pallid
staggering
and
with
chattering
teeth
he
triumphantly
laid
the
gloves
before
the
old
chief
and
received
the
congratulations
of
the
men
and
the
caresses
of
the
women
then
breaking
away
from
his
friends
and
admirers
he
threw
himself
into
the
river
and
remained
in
its
cool
soothing
water
till
nightfall
similarly
among
the
ticunas
of
the
upper
amazon
on
the
border
of
peru
the
young
man
who
would
take
his
place
among
the
warriors
must
plunge
his
arm
into
a
sort
of
basket
full
of
venomous
ants
and
keep
it
there
for
several
minutes
without
uttering
a
cry
he
generally
falls
backwards
and
sometimes
succumbs
to
the
fever
which
ensues
hence
as
soon
as
the
ordeal
is
over
the
women
are
prodigal
of
their
attentions
to
him
and
rub
the
swollen
arm
with
a
particular
kind
of
herb
ordeals
of
this
sort
appear
to
be
in
vogue
among
the
indians
of
the
rio
negro
as
well
as
of
the
amazon
among
the
rucuyennes
a
tribe
of
indians
in
the
north
of
brazil
on
the
borders
of
guiana
young
men
who
are
candidates
for
marriage
must
submit
to
be
stung
all
over
their
persons
not
only
with
ants
but
with
wasps
which
are
applied
to
their
naked
bodies
in
curious
instruments
of
shaped
like
fantastic
quadrupeds
or
birds
the
patient
invariably
falls
down
in
a
swoon
and
is
carried
like
dead
to
his
hammock
where
he
is
tightly
lashed
with
cords
as
they
come
to
themselves
they
writhe
in
agony
so
that
their
hammocks
rock
violently
to
and
fro
causing
the
hut
to
shake
as
if
it
were
about
to
collapse
this
dreadful
ordeal
is
called
by
the
indians
a
the
same
ordeal
under
the
same
name
is
also
practised
by
the
wayanas
an
indian
tribe
of
french
guiana
but
with
them
we
are
told
it
is
no
longer
deemed
an
indispensable
preliminary
to
marriage
it
is
rather
a
sort
of
national
medicine
administered
chiefly
to
the
youth
of
both
applied
to
men
the
as
it
is
called
sharpens
them
prevents
them
from
being
heavy
and
lazy
makes
them
active
brisk
industrious
imparts
strength
and
helps
them
to
shoot
well
with
the
bow
without
it
the
indians
would
always
be
slack
and
rather
sickly
would
always
have
a
little
fever
and
would
lie
perpetually
in
their
hammocks
as
for
the
women
the
keeps
them
from
going
to
sleep
renders
them
active
alert
brisk
gives
them
strength
and
a
liking
for
work
makes
them
good
housekeepers
good
workers
at
the
stockade
good
makers
of
every
one
undergoes
the
at
least
twice
in
his
life
sometimes
thrice
and
oftener
if
he
likes
it
may
be
had
from
the
age
of
about
eight
years
and
upward
and
no
one
thinks
it
odd
that
a
man
of
forty
should
voluntarily
submit
to
similarly
the
indians
of
juan
capistrano
in
california
used
to
be
branded
on
some
part
of
their
bodies
generally
on
the
right
arm
but
sometimes
on
the
leg
also
not
as
a
proof
of
manly
fortitude
but
because
they
believed
that
the
custom
added
greater
strength
to
the
nerves
and
gave
a
better
pulse
for
the
management
of
the
afterwards
they
were
whipped
with
nettles
and
covered
with
ants
that
they
might
become
robust
and
the
infliction
was
always
performed
in
summer
during
the
months
of
july
and
august
when
the
nettle
was
in
its
most
fiery
state
they
gathered
small
bunches
which
they
fastened
together
and
the
poor
deluded
indian
was
chastised
by
inflicting
blows
with
them
upon
his
naked
limbs
until
unable
to
walk
and
then
he
was
carried
to
the
nest
of
the
nearest
and
most
furious
species
of
ants
and
laid
down
among
them
while
some
of
his
friends
with
sticks
kept
annoying
the
insects
to
make
them
still
more
violent
what
torments
did
they
not
undergo
what
pain
what
hellish
inflictions
yet
their
faith
gave
them
power
to
endure
all
without
a
murmur
and
they
remained
as
if
dead
having
undergone
these
dreadful
ordeals
they
were
considered
as
invulnerable
and
believed
that
the
arrows
of
their
enemies
could
no
longer
harm
among
the
alur
a
tribe
inhabiting
the
region
of
the
upper
nile
to
bury
a
man
in
an
and
leave
him
there
for
a
while
is
the
regular
treatment
for
insanity
in
like
manner
it
is
probable
that
beating
or
scourging
as
a
religious
or
ceremonial
rite
was
originally
a
mode
of
purification
it
was
meant
to
wipe
off
and
drive
away
a
dangerous
contagion
whether
personified
as
demoniacal
or
not
which
was
supposed
to
be
adhering
physically
though
invisibly
to
the
body
of
the
sufferer
the
pain
inflicted
on
the
person
beaten
was
no
more
the
object
of
the
beating
than
it
is
of
a
surgical
operation
with
us
it
was
a
necessary
accident
that
was
all
in
later
times
such
customs
were
interpreted
otherwise
and
the
pain
from
being
an
accident
became
the
prime
object
of
the
ceremony
which
was
now
regarded
either
as
a
test
of
endurance
imposed
upon
persons
at
critical
epochs
of
life
or
as
a
mortification
of
the
flesh
well
pleasing
to
the
god
but
asceticism
under
any
shape
or
form
is
never
primitive
the
savage
it
is
true
in
certain
circumstances
will
voluntarily
subject
himself
to
pains
and
privations
which
appear
to
us
wholly
needless
but
he
never
acts
thus
unless
he
believes
that
some
solid
temporal
advantage
is
to
be
gained
by
so
doing
pain
for
the
sake
of
pain
whether
as
a
moral
discipline
in
this
life
or
as
a
means
of
winning
a
glorious
immortality
hereafter
is
not
an
object
which
he
sets
himself
deliberately
to
pursue
if
this
view
is
correct
we
can
understand
why
so
many
indian
tribes
of
south
america
compel
the
youth
of
both
sexes
to
submit
to
these
painful
and
sometimes
fatal
ordeals
they
imagine
that
in
this
way
they
rid
the
young
folk
of
certain
evils
inherent
in
youth
especially
at
the
critical
age
of
puberty
and
when
they
picture
to
themselves
the
evils
in
a
personal
form
as
dangerous
spirits
or
demons
the
ceremony
of
their
expulsion
may
in
the
strict
sense
be
termed
an
exorcism
this
certainly
appears
to
be
the
interpretation
which
the
banivas
of
the
orinoco
put
upon
the
cruel
scourgings
which
they
inflict
on
girls
at
puberty
at
her
first
menstruation
a
baniva
girl
must
pass
several
days
and
nights
in
her
hammock
almost
motionless
and
getting
nothing
to
eat
and
drink
but
water
and
a
little
manioc
while
she
lies
there
the
suitors
for
her
hand
apply
to
her
father
and
he
who
can
afford
to
give
most
for
her
or
can
prove
himself
the
best
man
is
promised
the
damsel
in
marriage
the
fast
over
some
old
men
enter
the
hut
bandage
the
girl
s
eyes
cover
her
head
with
a
bonnet
of
which
the
fringes
fall
on
her
shoulders
and
then
lead
her
forth
and
tie
her
to
a
post
set
up
in
an
open
place
the
head
of
the
post
is
carved
in
the
shape
of
a
grotesque
face
none
but
the
old
men
may
witness
what
follows
were
a
woman
caught
peeping
and
prying
it
would
go
ill
with
her
she
would
be
marked
out
for
the
vengeance
of
the
demon
who
would
make
her
expiate
her
crime
at
the
very
next
moon
by
madness
or
death
every
participant
in
the
ceremony
comes
armed
with
a
scourge
of
cords
or
of
fish
skins
some
of
them
reinforce
the
virtue
of
the
instrument
by
tying
little
sharp
stones
to
the
end
of
the
thongs
then
to
the
dismal
and
deafening
notes
of
blown
by
two
or
three
supernumeraries
the
men
circle
round
and
round
the
post
every
one
applying
his
scourge
as
he
passes
to
the

back
till
it
streams
with
blood
at
last

musicians
winding
tremendous
blasts
on
their
trumpets
against

and
touch

in
which

is
supposed
to
be

the
blows
cease
to
descend

state

carried
away
to
have
her
wounds
washed
and

applied

the
youngest
of
the
executioners
or
rather
of
the
exorcists
hastens
to
inform
her
betrothed
husband
of
the
happy
issue
of
the
exorcism
the
spirit
he
says
had
cast
thy
beloved
into
a
sleep
as
deep
almost
as
that
of
death
but
we
have
rescued
her
from
his
attacks
and
laid
her
down
in
such
and
such
a
place

then
going
from
house
to
house
through
the
village

cries
to
the
inmates
come
let
us
burn
the
demon
who
would
have
taken
possession
of
such
and
such
a
girl
our
the
bridegroom
at
once
carries
his
wounded
and
suffering
bride
to
his
own
house

all
the
people
gather
round
the
post
for
the
pleasure
of
burning
it
and
the
demon
together
a
great
pile
of
firewood
has
meanwhile
been
heaped
up
about
it
and
the
women
run
round
the
pyre
cursing
in
shrill
voices
the
wicked
spirit
who
has
wrought
all
this
evil

men
join
in
with
hoarser
cries
and
animate
themselves
for
the
business
in

by
deep
draughts
of
an
intoxicant

has
been

the
occasion

to
the
care
of
his
mother

on
the
scene
brandishing
a
lighted
torch
he
addresses
the
demon
with
bitter
mockery
and
reproaches
informs
him
that

fair
creature
on
whom

had
nefarious
designs
is
now
his
the
bridegroom

blooming
spouse
and
shaking
his
torch
at
the
grinning
head
on

he
screams
out
this
is
how
the
victims
of
thy
persecution
take
vengeance
on
thee
with
these
words

puts

on

till

retiring
again

two
rows
join

and
forming
a
huge
circle
trip
it
round
and
round
the
blaze
till
the
post
with
its
grotesque
face
is
consumed
in
the
flames
and
nothing
of
the
pyre
remains
but
a
heap
of
red
and
glowing
embers
the

spirit
has
been
destroyed

delivered
from

persecutor
the

be
free
from
sickness

not

and
will
bear

it
appears
that
the
banivas
attribute
the
symptoms

covered
and
is
bathed
by
women
at
the
back
of
the
house
near
the
are
kept
branches
of
any
tree
usually
of
the
in
some
cases
while
the
time
of
purification
or
uncleanness
lasts
the
maiden
stays
in
a
separate
hut
which
is
afterwards
burnt
down
in
cambodia
a
girl
at
puberty
is
put
to
bed
under
a
mosquito
curtain
where
she
should
stay
a
hundred
days
usually
however
four
five
ten
or
twenty
days
are
thought
enough
and
even
this
in
a
hot
climate
and
under
the
close
meshes
of
the
curtain
is
sufficiently
trying
according
to
another
account
a
cambodian
maiden
at
puberty
is
said
to
enter
into
the
during
her
retirement
which
according
to
the
rank
and
position
of
her
family
may
last
any
time
from
a
few
days
to
several
years
she
has
to
observe
a
number
of
rules
such
as
not
to
be
seen
by
a
strange
man
not
to
eat
flesh
or
fish
and
so
on
she
goes
nowhere
not
even
to
the
pagoda
but
this
state
of
seclusion
is
discontinued
during
eclipses
at
such
times
she
goes
forth
and
pays
her
devotions
to
the
monster
who
is
supposed
to
cause
eclipses
by
catching
the
heavenly
bodies
between
his
teeth
this
permission
to
break
her
rule
of
retirement
and
appear
abroad
during
an
eclipse
seems
to
shew
how
literally
the
injunction
is
interpreted
which
forbids
maidens
entering
on
womanhood
to
look
upon
the
sun
seclusion
of
girls
at
puberty
in
a
superstition
so
widely
diffused
as
this
might
be
expected
to
leave
traces
in
legends
and
and
it
has
done
so
in
a
danish
story
we
read
of
a
princess
who
was
fated
to
be
carried
off
by
a
warlock
if
ever
the
sun
shone
on
her
before
she
had
passed
her
thirtieth
year
so
the
king
her
father
kept
her
shut
up
in
the
palace
and
had
all
the
windows
on
the
east
south
and
west
sides
blocked
up
lest
a
sunbeam
should
fall
on
his
darling
child
and
he
should
thus
lose
her
for
ever
only
at
evening
when
the
sun
was
down
might
she
walk
for
a
little
in
the
beautiful
garden
of
the
castle
in
time
a
prince
came
followed
by
a
train
of
gorgeous
knights
and
squires
on
horses
all
ablaze
with
gold
and
silver
the
king
said
the
prince
might
have
his
daughter
to
wife
on
condition
that
he
would
not
carry
her
away
to
his
home
till
she
was
thirty
years
old
but
would
live
with
her
in
the
castle
where
the
windows
looked
out
only
to
the
north
the
prince
agreed
so
married
they
were
the
bride
was
only
fifteen
and
fifteen
more
long
weary
years
must
pass
before
she
might
step
out
of
the
gloomy
donjon
breathe
the
fresh
air
and
see
the
sun
but
she
and
her
gallant
young
bridegroom
loved
each
other
and
they
were
happy
often
they
sat
hand
in
hand
at
the
window
looking
out
to
the
north
and
talked
of
what
they
would
do
when
they
were
free
still
it
was
a
little
dull
to
look
out
always
at
the
same
window
and
to
see
nothing
but
the
castle
woods
and
the
distant
hills
and
the
clouds
drifting
silently
over
them
well
one
day
it
happened
that
all
the
people
in
the
castle
had
gone
away
to
a
neighbouring
castle
to
witness
a
tournament
and
other
gaieties
and
the
two
young
folks
were
left
as
usual
all
alone
at
the
window
looking
out
to
the
north
they
sat
silent
for
a
time
gazing
away
to
the
hills
it
was
a
grey
sad
day
the
sky
was
overcast
and
the
weather
seemed
to
draw
to
rain
at
last
the
prince
said
there
will
be
no
sunshine
what
if
we
were
to
drive
over
and
join
the
rest
at
the
tournament
his
young
wife
gladly
consented
for
she
longed
to
see
more
of
the
world
than
those
eternal
green
woods
and
those
eternal
blue
hills
which
were
all
she
ever
saw
from
the
window
so
the
horses
were
put
into
the
coach
and
it
rattled
up
to
the
door
and
in
they
got
and
away
they
drove
at
first
all
went
well
the
clouds
hung
low
over
the
woods
the
wind
sighed
in
the
trees
a
drearier
day
you
could
hardly
imagine
so
they
joined
the
rest
at
the
other
castle
and
took
their
seats
to
watch
the
jousting
in
the
lists
so
intent
were
they
in
watching
the
gay
spectacle
of
the
prancing
steeds
the
fluttering
pennons
and
the
glittering
armour
of
the
knights
that
they
failed
to
mark
the
change
the
fatal
change
in
the
weather
for
the
wind
was
rising
and
had
begun
to
disperse
the
clouds
and
suddenly
the
sun
broke
through
and
the
glory
of
it
fell
like
an
aureole
on
the
young
wife
and
at
once
she
vanished
away
no
sooner
did
her
husband
miss
her
from
his
side
than
he
too
mysteriously
disappeared
the
tournament
broke
up
in
confusion
the
bereft
father
hastened
home
and
shut
himself
up
in
the
dark
castle
from
which
the
light
of
life
had
departed
the
green
woods
and
the
blue
hills
could
still
be
seen
from
the
window
that
looked
to
the
north
but
the
young
faces
that
had
gazed
out
of
it
so
wistfully
were
gone
as
it
seemed
for
ever
a
tyrolese
story
tells
how
it
was
the
doom
of
a
lovely
maiden
with
golden
hair
to
be
transported
into
the
belly
of
a
whale
if
ever
a
sunbeam
fell
on
her
hearing
of
the
fame
of
her
beauty
the
king
of
the
country
sent
for
her
to
be
his
bride
and
her
brother
drove
the
fair
damsel
to
the
palace
in
a
carefully
closed
coach
himself
sitting
on
the
box
and
handling
the
reins
on
the
way
they
overtook
two
hideous
witches
who
pretended
they
were
weary
and
begged
for
a
lift
in
the
coach
at
first
the
brother
refused
to
take
them
in
but
his
sister
entreated
him
to
have
compassion
on
the
two
poor
footsore
women
for
you
may
easily
imagine
that
she
was
not
acquainted
with
their
true
character
so
down
he
got
rather
surlily
from
the
box
opened
the
coach
door
and
in
the
two
witches
stepped
laughing
in
their
sleeves
but
no
sooner
had
the
brother
mounted
the
box
and
whipped
up
the
horses
than
one
of
the
two
wicked
witches
bored
a
hole
in
the
closed
coach
a
sunbeam
at
once
shot
through
the
hole
and
fell
on
the
fair
damsel
so
she
vanished
from
the
coach
and
was
spirited
away
into
the
belly
of
a
whale
in
the
neighbouring
sea
you
can
imagine
the
consternation
of
the
king
when
the
coach
door
opened
and
instead
of
his
blooming
bride
out
bounced
two
hideous
hags
in
a
modern
greek
the
fates
predict
that
in
her
fifteenth
year
a
princess
must
be
careful
not
to
let
the
sun
shine
on
her
for
if
this
were
to
happen
she
would
be
turned
into
a
lizard
in
another
modern
greek
tale
the
sun
bestows
a
daughter
upon
a
childless
woman
on
condition
of
taking
the
child
back
to
himself
when
she
is
twelve
years
old
so
when
the
child
was
twelve
the
mother
closed
the
doors
and
windows
and
stopped
up
all
the
chinks
and
crannies
to
prevent
the
sun
from
coming
to
fetch
away
her
daughter
but
she
forgot
to
stop
up
the
and
a
sunbeam
streamed
through
it
and
carried
off
the
girl
in
a
sicilian
story
a
seer
foretells
that
a
king
will
have
a
daughter
who
in
her
fourteenth
year
will
conceive
a
child
by
the
sun
so
when
the
child
was
born
the
king
shut
her
up
in
a
lonely
tower
which
had
no
window
lest
a
sunbeam
should
fall
on
her
when
she
was
nearly
fourteen
years
old
it
happened
that
her
parents
sent
her
a
piece
of
roasted
kid
in
which
she
found
a
sharp
bone
with
this
bone
she
scraped
a
hole
in
the
wall
and
a
sunbeam
shot
through
the
hole
and
got
her
with
child
the
old
greek
story
of
danae
who
was
confined
by
her
father
in
a
subterranean
chamber
or
a
brazen
tower
but
impregnated
by
zeus
who
reached
her
in
the
shape
of
a
shower
of
gold
perhaps
belongs
to
the
same
class
of
tales
it
has
its
counterpart
in
the
legend
which
the
kirghiz
of
siberia
tell
of
their
ancestry
a
certain
khan
had
a
fair
daughter
whom
he
kept
in
a
dark
iron
house
that
no
man
might
see
her
an
old
woman
tended
her
and
when
the
girl
was
grown
to
maidenhood
she
asked
the
old
woman
where
do
you
go
so
often
my
child
said
the
old
dame
there
is
a
bright
world
in
that
bright
world
your
father
and
mother
live
and
all
sorts
of
people
live
there
that
is
where
i
the
maiden
said
good
mother
i
will
tell
nobody
but
shew
me
that
bright
so
the
old
woman
took
the
girl
out
of
the
iron
house
but
when
she
saw
the
bright
world
the
girl
tottered
and
fainted
and
the
eye
of
god
fell
upon
her
and
she
conceived
her
angry
father
put
her
in
a
golden
chest
and
sent
her
floating
away
fairy
gold
can
float
in
fairyland
over
the
wide
sea
the
shower
of
gold
in
the
greek
story
and
the
eye
of
god
in
the
kirghiz
legend
probably
stand
for
sunlight
and
the
sun
the
idea
that
women
may
be
impregnated
by
the
sun
is
not
uncommon
in
legends
thus
for
example
among
the
indians
of
guacheta
in
colombia
it
is
said
a
report
once
ran
that
the
sun
would
impregnate
one
of
their
maidens
who
should
bear
a
child
and
yet
remain
a
virgin
the
chief
had
two
daughters
and
was
very
desirous
that
one
of
them
should
conceive
in
this
miraculous
manner
so
every
day
he
made
them
climb
a
hill
to
the
east
of
his
house
in
order
to
be
touched
by
the
first
beams
of
the
rising
sun
his
wishes
were
fulfilled
for
one
of
the
damsels
conceived
and
after
nine
months
gave
birth
to
an
emerald
so
she
wrapped
it
in
cotton
and
placed
it
in
her
bosom
and
in
a
few
days
it
turned
into
a
child
who
received
the
name
of
garanchacha
and
was
universally
recognized
as
a
son
of
the
sun
again
the
samoans
tell
of
a
woman
named
mangamangai
who
became
pregnant
by
looking
at
the
rising
sun
her
son
grew
up
and
was
named
child
of
the
at
his
marriage
he
applied
to
his
mother
for
a
dowry
but
she
bade
him
apply
to
his
father
the
sun
and
told
him
how
to
go
to
him
so
one
morning
he
took
a
long
vine
and
made
a
noose
in
it
then
climbing
up
a
tree
he
threw
the
noose
over
the
sun
and
caught
him
fast
thus
arrested
in
his
progress
the
luminary
asked
him
what
he
wanted
and
being
told
by
the
young
man
that
he
wanted
a
present
for
his
bride
the
sun
obligingly
packed
up
a
store
of
blessings
in
a
basket
with
which
the
youth
descended
to
the
earth
even
in
the
marriage
customs
of
various
races
we
may
perhaps
detect
traces
of
this
belief
that
women
can
be
impregnated
by
the
sun
thus
amongst
the
chaco
indians
of
south
america
a
newly
married
couple
used
to
sleep
the
first
night
on
a
mare
s
or
bullock
s
skin
with
their
heads
towards
the
west
for
the
marriage
is
not
considered
ratified
till
the
rising
sun
shines
on
their
feet
the
succeeding
at
old
hindoo
marriages
the
first
ceremony
was
the
during
the
previous
day
the
bride
was
made
to
look
towards
the
sun
or
to
be
in
some
way
exposed
to
its
rays
amongst
the
turks
of
siberia
it
was
formerly
the
custom
on
the
morning
after
the
marriage
to
lead
the
young
couple
out
of
the
hut
to
greet
the
rising
sun
the
same
custom
is
said
to
be
still
practised
in
iran
and
central
asia
under
a
belief
that
the
beams
of
the
rising
sun
are
the
surest
means
of
impregnating
the
new
bride
and
as
some
people
think
that
women
may
be
gotten
with
child
by
the
sun
so
others
imagine
that
they
can
conceive
by
the
moon
according
to
the
greenlanders
the
moon
is
a
young
man
and
he
now
and
then
comes
down
to
give
their
wives
a
visit
and
caress
them
for
which
reason
no
woman
dare
sleep
lying
upon
her
back
without
she
first
spits
upon
her
fingers
and
rubs
her
belly
with
it
for
the
same
reason
the
young
maids
are
afraid
to
stare
long
at
the
moon
imagining
they
may
get
a
child
by
the
similarly
breton
peasants
are
reported
to
believe
that
women
or
girls
who
expose
their
persons
to
the
moonlight
may
be
impregnated
by
it
and
give
birth
to
monsters
reasons
for
the
seclusion
of
girls
at
puberty
the
motive
for
the
restraints
so
commonly
imposed
on
girls
at
puberty
is
the
deeply
engrained
dread
which
primitive
man
universally
entertains
of
menstruous
blood
he
fears
it
at
all
times
but
especially
on
its
first
appearance
hence
the
restrictions
under
which
women
lie
at
their
first
menstruation
are
usually
more
stringent
than
those
which
they
have
to
observe
at
any
subsequent
recurrence
of
the
mysterious
flow
some
evidence
of
the
fear
and
of
the
customs
based
on
it
has
been
cited
in
an
earlier
part
of
this
work
but
as
the
terror
for
it
is
nothing
less
which
the
phenomenon
periodically
strikes
into
the
mind
of
the
savage
has
deeply
influenced
his
life
and
institutions
it
may
be
well
to
illustrate
the
subject
with
some
further
examples
thus
in
the
encounter
bay
tribe
of
south
australia
there
is
or
used
to
be
a
superstition
which
obliges
a
woman
to
separate
herself
from
the
camp
at
the
time
of
her
monthly
illness
when
if
a
young
man
or
boy
should
approach
she
calls
out
and
he
immediately
makes
a
circuit
to
avoid
her
if
she
is
neglectful
upon
this
point
she
exposes
herself
to
scolding
and
sometimes
to
severe
beating
by
her
husband
or
nearest
relation
because
the
boys
are
told
from
their
infancy
that
if
they
see
the
blood
they
will
early
become
and
their
strength
will
fail
and
of
the
south
australian
aborigines
in
general
we
read
that
there
is
a
custom
requiring
all
boys
and
uninitiated
young
men
to
sleep
at
some
distance
from
the
huts
of
the
adults
and
to
remove
altogether
away
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
daylight
dawns
and
the
natives
begin
to
move
about
this
is
to
prevent
their
seeing
the
women
some
of
whom
may
be
menstruating
and
if
looked
upon
by
the
young
males
it
is
supposed
that
dire
results
will
and
amongst
these
tribes
women
in
their
courses
are
not
allowed
to
eat
fish
of
any
kind
or
to
go
near
the
water
at
all
it
being
one
of
their
superstitions
that
if
a
female
in
that
state
goes
near
the
water
no
success
can
be
expected
by
the
men
in
similarly
among
the
natives
of
the
murray
river
menstruous
women
were
not
allowed
to
go
near
water
for
fear
of
frightening
the
fish
they
were
also
not
allowed
to
eat
them
for
the
same
reason
a
woman
during
such
periods
would
never
cross
the
river
in
a
canoe
or
even
fetch
water
for
the
camp
it
was
sufficient
for
her
to
say
to
ensure
her
husband
getting
the
water
the
dieri
of
central
australia
believe
that
if
women
at
these
times
were
to
eat
fish
or
bathe
in
a
river
the
fish
would
all
die
and
the
water
would
dry
up
in
this
tribe
a
mark
made
with
red
ochre
round
a
woman
s
mouth
indicates
that
she
has
her
courses
no
one
would
offer
fish
to
such
a
woman
the
arunta
of
central
australia
forbid
menstruous
women
to
gather
the
bulbs
which
form
a
staple
article
of
diet
for
both
men
and
women
they
believe
that
were
a
woman
to
break
this
rule
the
supply
of
bulbs
would
fail
among
the
aborigines
of
victoria
the
wife
at
her
monthly
periods
had
to
sleep
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
from
her
husband
she
might
partake
of
nobody
s
food
and
nobody
would
partake
of
hers
for
people
thought
that
if
they
ate
or
drank
anything
that
had
been
touched
by
a
woman
in
her
courses
it
would
make
them
weak
or
unmarried
girls
and
widows
at
such
times
had
to
paint
their
heads
and
the
upper
parts
of
their
bodies
red
no
doubt
as
a
danger
signal
in
some
australian
tribes
the
seclusion
of
menstruous
women
was
even
more
rigid
and
was
enforced
by
severer
penalties
than
a
scolding
or
a
beating
thus
with
regard
to
certain
tribes
of
new
south
wales
and
southern
queensland
we
are
told
that
during
the
monthly
illness
the
woman
is
not
allowed
to
touch
anything
that
men
use
or
even
to
walk
on
a
path
that
any
man
frequents
on
pain
of
again
there
is
a
regulation
relating
to
camps
in
the
wakelbura
tribe
which
forbids
the
women
coming
into
the
encampment
by
the
same
path
as
the
men
any
violation
of
this
rule
would
in
a
large
camp
be
punished
with
death
the
reason
for
this
is
the
dread
with
which
they
regard
the
menstrual
period
of
women
during
such
a
time
a
woman
is
kept
entirely
away
from
the
camp
half
a
mile
at
least
a
woman
in
such
a
condition
has
boughs
of
some
tree
of
her
totem
tied
round
her
loins
and
is
constantly
watched
and
guarded
for
it
is
thought
that
should
any
male
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
see
a
woman
in
such
a
condition
he
would
die
if
such
a
woman
were
to
let
herself
be
seen
by
a
man
she
would
probably
be
put
to
death
when
the
woman
has
recovered
she
is
painted
red
and
white
her
head
covered
with
feathers
and
returns
to
the
in
muralug
one
of
the
torres
straits
islands
a
menstruous
woman
may
not
eat
anything
that
lives
in
the
sea
else
the
natives
believe
that
the
fisheries
would
fail
again
in
mabuiag
another
of
these
islands
women
who
have
their
courses
on
them
may
not
eat
turtle
flesh
nor
turtle
eggs
probably
for
a
similar
reason
and
during
the
season
when
the
turtles
are
pairing
the
restrictions
laid
on
such
a
woman
are
much
severer
she
may
not
even
enter
a
house
in
which
there
is
turtle
flesh
nor
approach
a
fire
on
which
the
flesh
is
cooking
she
may
not
go
near
the
sea
and
she
should
not
walk
on
the
beach
below
mark
nay
the
infection
extends
to
her
husband
who
may
not
himself
harpoon
or
otherwise
take
an
active
part
in
catching
turtle
however
he
is
permitted
to
form
one
of
the
crew
on
a
turtling
expedition
provided
he
takes
the
precaution
of
rubbing
his
armpits
with
certain
leaves
to
which
no
doubt
a
disinfectant
virtue
is
ascribed
among
the
kai
of
german
new
guinea
women
at
their
monthly
sickness
must
live
in
little
huts
built
for
them
in
the
forest
they
may
not
enter
the
cultivated
fields
for
if
they
did
go
to
them
and
the
pigs
were
to
taste
of
the
blood
it
would
inspire
the
animals
with
an
irresistible
desire
to
go
likewise
into
the
fields
where
they
would
commit
great
depredations
on
the
growing
crops
hence
the
issue
from
women
at
these
times
is
carefully
buried
to
prevent
the
pigs
from
getting
at
it
and
conversely
if
the
pigs
often
break
into
the
fields
the
blame
is
laid
on
the
women
who
by
the
neglect
of
these
elementary
precautions
have
put
temptation
in
the
way
of
the
swine
in
galela
to
the
west
of
new
guinea
women
at
their
monthly
periods
may
not
enter
a
or
the
plants
would
be
attacked
by
disease
the
minangkabauers
of
sumatra
are
persuaded
that
if
a
woman
in
her
unclean
state
were
to
go
near
a
the
crop
would
be
spoiled
the
bushmen
of
south
africa
think
that
by
a
glance
of
a
girl
s
eye
at
the
time
when
she
ought
to
be
kept
in
strict
retirement
men
become
fixed
in
whatever
position
they
happen
to
occupy
with
whatever
they
were
holding
in
their
hands
and
are
changed
into
trees
that
talk
tribes
of
south
africa
hold
that
their
cattle
would
die
if
the
milk
were
drunk
by
a
menstruous
woman
and
they
fear
the
same
disaster
if
a
drop
of
her
blood
were
to
fall
on
the
ground
and
the
oxen
were
to
pass
over
it
to
prevent
such
a
calamity
women
in
general
not
menstruous
women
only
are
forbidden
to
enter
the
cattle
enclosure
and
more
than
that
they
may
not
use
the
ordinary
paths
in
entering
the
village
or
in
passing
from
one
hut
to
another
they
are
obliged
to
make
circuitous
tracks
at
the
back
of
the
huts
in
order
to
avoid
the
ground
in
the
middle
of
the
village
where
the
cattle
stand
or
lie
down
these
women
s
tracks
may
be
seen
at
every
caffre
village
similarly
among
the
bahima
a
tribe
of
ankole
in
central
africa
no
menstruous
woman
may
drink
milk
lest
by
so
doing
she
should
injure
the
cows
and
she
may
not
lie
on
her
husband
s
bed
no
doubt
lest
she
should
injure
him
indeed
she
is
forbidden
to
lie
on
a
bed
at
all
and
must
sleep
on
the
ground
her
diet
is
restricted
to
vegetables
and
beer
among
the
baganda
in
like
manner
no
menstruous
woman
might
drink
milk
or
come
into
contact
with
any
and
she
might
not
touch
anything
that
belonged
to
her
husband
nor
sit
on
his
mat
nor
cook
his
food
if
she
touched
anything
of
his
at
such
a
time
it
was
deemed
equivalent
to
wishing
him
dead
or
to
actually
working
magic
for
his
destruction
were
she
to
handle
any
article
of
his
he
would
surely
fall
ill
were
she
to
handle
his
weapons
he
would
certainly
be
killed
in
the
next
battle
even
a
woman
who
did
not
menstruate
was
believed
by
the
baganda
to
be
a
source
of
danger
to
her
husband
indeed
capable
of
killing
him
hence
before
he
went
to
war
he
used
to
wound
her
slightly
with
his
spear
so
as
to
draw
blood
this
was
thought
to
ensure
his
safe
return
apparently
the
notion
was
that
if
the
wife
did
not
lose
blood
in
one
way
or
another
her
husband
would
be
bled
in
war
to
make
up
for
her
deficiency
so
by
way
of
guarding
against
this
undesirable
event
he
took
care
to
relieve
her
of
a
little
superfluous
blood
before
he
repaired
to
the
field
of
honour
further
the
baganda
would
not
suffer
a
menstruous
woman
to
visit
a
well
if
she
did
so
they
feared
that
the
water
would
dry
up
and
that
she
herself
would
fall
sick
and
die
unless
she
confessed
her
fault
and
the
made
atonement
for
her
among
the
akikuyu
of
british
east
africa
if
a
new
hut
is
built
in
a
village
and
the
wife
chances
to
menstruate
in
it
on
the
day
she
lights
the
first
fire
there
the
hut
must
be
broken
down
and
demolished
the
very
next
day
the
woman
may
on
no
account
sleep
a
second
night
in
it
there
is
a
curse
both
on
her
and
on
it
in
the
suk
tribe
of
british
east
africa
warriors
may
not
eat
anything
that
has
been
touched
by
menstruous
women
if
they
did
so
it
is
believed
that
they
would
lose
their
virility
in
the
rain
they
will
shiver
and
in
the
heat
they
will
suk
men
and
women
take
their
meals
apart
because
the
men
fear
that
one
or
more
of
the
women
may
be
menstruating
the
anyanja
of
british
central
africa
at
the
southern
end
of
lake
nyassa
think
that
a
man
who
should
sleep
with
a
woman
in
her
courses
would
fall
sick
and
die
unless
some
remedy
were
applied
in
time
and
with
them
it
is
a
rule
that
at
such
times
a
woman
should
not
put
any
salt
into
the
food
she
is
cooking
otherwise
the
people
who
partook
of
the
food
salted
by
her
would
suffer
from
a
certain
disease
called
hence
to
obviate
the
danger
she
calls
a
child
to
put
the
salt
into
the
dish
among
the
hos
a
tribe
of
ewe
negroes
of
togoland
in
west
africa
so
long
as
a
wife
has
her
monthly
sickness
she
may
not
cook
for
her
husband
nor
lie
on
his
bed
nor
sit
on
his
stool
an
infraction
of
these
rules
would
assuredly
it
is
believed
cause
her
husband
to
die
if
her
husband
is
a
priest
or
a
magician
or
a
chief
she
may
not
pass
the
days
of
her
uncleanness
in
the
house
but
must
go
elsewhere
till
she
is
clean
among
the
ewe
negroes
of
this
region
each
village
has
its
huts
where
women
who
have
their
courses
on
them
must
spend
their
time
secluded
from
intercourse
with
other
people
sometimes
these
huts
stand
by
themselves
in
public
places
sometimes
they
are
mere
shelters
built
either
at
the
back
or
front
of
the
ordinary
a
woman
is
punishable
if
she
does
not
pass
the
time
of
her
monthly
sickness
in
one
of
these
huts
or
shelters
provided
for
her
use
thus
if
she
shews
herself
in
her
own
house
or
even
in
the
yard
of
the
house
she
may
be
fined
a
sheep
which
is
killed
its
flesh
divided
among
the
people
and
its
blood
poured
on
the
image
of
the
chief
god
as
a
to
expiate
her
offence
she
is
also
forbidden
to
go
to
the
place
where
the
villagers
draw
water
and
if
she
breaks
the
rule
she
must
give
a
goat
to
be
killed
its
flesh
is
distributed
and
its
blood
diluted
with
water
and
mixed
with
herbs
is
sprinkled
on
the
and
on
the
paths
leading
to
it
were
any
woman
to
disregard
these
salutary
precautions
the
chief
in
the
village
would
fall
sick
and
die
which
would
be
an
irreparable
loss
to
society
the
miraculous
virtue
ascribed
to
menstruous
blood
is
well
illustrated
in
a
story
told
by
the
arab
chronicler
tabari
he
relates
how
sapor
king
of
persia
besieged
the
strong
city
of
atrae
in
the
desert
of
mesopotamia
for
several
years
without
being
able
to
take
it
but
the
king
of
the
city
whose
name
was
daizan
had
a
daughter
and
when
it
was
with
her
after
the
manner
of
women
she
went
forth
from
the
city
and
dwelt
for
a
time
in
the
suburb
for
such
was
the
custom
of
the
place
now
it
fell
out
that
while
she
tarried
there
sapor
saw
her
and
loved
her
and
she
loved
him
for
he
was
a
handsome
man
and
she
a
lovely
maid
and
she
said
to
him
what
will
you
give
me
if
i
shew
you
how
you
may
destroy
the
walls
of
this
city
and
slay
my
father
and
he
said
to
her
i
will
give
you
what
you
will
and
i
will
exalt
you
above
my
other
wives
and
will
set
you
nearer
to
me
than
them
then
she
said
to
him
take
a
greenish
dove
with
a
ring
about
its
neck
and
write
something
on
its
foot
with
the
menstruous
blood
of
a
maid
then
let
the
bird
loose
and
it
will
perch
on
the
walls
of
the
city
and
they
will
fall
for
that
says
the
arab
historian
was
the
talisman
of
the
city
which
could
not
be
destroyed
in
any
other
way
and
sapor
did
as
she
bade
him
and
the
city
fell
down
in
a
heap
and
he
stormed
it
and
slew
daizan
on
the
spot
according
to
the
talmud
if
a
woman
at
the
beginning
of
her
period
passes
between
two
men
she
thereby
kills
one
of
them
if
she
passes
between
them
towards
the
end
of
her
period
she
only
causes
them
to
quarrel
violently
maimonides
tells
us
that
down
to
his
time
it
was
a
common
custom
in
the
east
to
keep
women
at
their
periods
in
a
separate
house
and
to
burn
everything
on
which
they
had
trodden
a
man
who
spoke
with
such
a
woman
or
who
was
merely
exposed
to
the
same
wind
that
blew
over
her
became
thereby
unclean
peasants
of
the
lebanon
think
that
menstruous
women
are
the
cause
of
many
misfortunes
their
shadow
causes
flowers
to
wither
and
trees
to
perish
it
even
arrests
the
movements
of
serpents
if
one
of
them
mounts
a
horse
the
animal
might
die
or
at
least
be
disabled
for
a
long
time
in
syria
to
this
day
a
woman
who
has
her
courses
on
her
may
neither
salt
nor
pickle
for
the
people
think
that
whatever
she
pickled
or
salted
would
not
keep
the
toaripi
of
new
guinea
doubtless
for
a
similar
reason
will
not
allow
women
at
such
times
to
cook
the
bhuiyars
a
dravidian
tribe
of
south
mirzapur
are
said
to
feel
an
intense
dread
of
menstrual
pollution
every
house
has
two
doors
one
of
which
is
used
only
by
women
in
this
condition
during
her
impurity
the
wife
is
fed
by
her
husband
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
family
and
whenever
she
has
to
quit
the
house
she
is
obliged
to
creep
out
on
her
hands
and
knees
in
order
not
to
defile
the
thatch
by
her
touch
the
kharwars
another
aboriginal
tribe
of
the
same
district
keep
their
women
at
such
seasons
in
the
outer
verandah
of
the
house
for
eight
days
and
will
not
let
them
enter
the
kitchen
or
the
during
this
time
the
unclean
woman
may
not
cook
nor
even
touch
the
cooking
vessels
when
the
eight
days
are
over
she
bathes
washes
her
clothes
and
returns
to
family
life
hindoo
women
seclude
themselves
at
their
monthly
periods
and
observe
a
number
of
rules
such
as
not
to
drink
milk
not
to
milk
cows
not
to
touch
fire
not
to
lie
on
a
high
bed
not
to
walk
on
common
paths
not
to
cross
the
track
of
animals
not
to
walk
by
the
side
of
flowering
plants
and
not
to
observe
the
heavenly
bodies
the
motive
for
these
restrictions
is
not
mentioned
but
probably
it
is
a
dread
of
the
baleful
influence
which
is
supposed
to
emanate
from
women
at
these
times
the
parsees
who
reverence
fire
will
not
suffer
menstruous
women
to
see
it
or
even
to
look
on
a
lighted
taper
during
their
infirmity
the
women
retire
from
their
houses
to
little
lodges
in
the
country
whither
victuals
are
brought
to
them
daily
at
the
end
of
their
seclusion
they
bathe
and
send
a
kid
a
fowl
or
a
pigeon
to
the
priest
as
an
offering
in
annam
a
woman
at
her
monthly
periods
is
deemed
a
centre
of
impurity
and
contact
with
her
is
avoided
she
is
subject
to
all
sorts
of
restrictions
which
she
must
observe
herself
and
which
others
must
observe
towards
her
she
may
not
touch
any
food
which
is
to
be
preserved
by
salting
whether
it
be
fish
flesh
or
vegetables
for
were
she
to
touch
it
the
food
would
putrefy
she
may
not
enter
any
sacred
place
she
may
not
be
present
at
any
religious
ceremony
the
linen
which
she
wears
at
such
times
must
be
washed
by
herself
at
sunrise
never
at
night
on
reaching
puberty
girls
may
not
touch
flowers
or
the
fruits
of
certain
trees
for
touched
by
them
the
flowers
would
fade
and
the
fruits
fall
to
the
ground
it
is
on
account
of
their
reputation
for
impurity
that
the
women
generally
live
isolated
in
every
house
they
have
an
apartment
reserved
for
them
and
they
never
eat
at
the
same
table
as
the
men
for
the
same
reason
they
are
excluded
from
all
religious
ceremonies
they
may
only
be
present
at
family
ceremonies
but
without
ever
officiating
in
the
guayquiries
of
the
orinoco
think
that
when
a
woman
has
her
courses
everything
upon
which
she
steps
will
die
and
that
if
a
man
treads
on
the
place
where
she
has
passed
his
legs
will
immediately
swell
up
among
the
guaraunos
of
the
same
great
river
women
at
their
periods
are
regarded
as
unclean
and
kept
apart
in
special
huts
where
all
that
they
need
is
brought
to
them
in
like
manner
among
the
piapocos
an
indian
tribe
on
the
guayabero
a
tributary
of
the
orinoco
a
menstruous
woman
is
secluded
from
her
family
every
month
for
four
or
five
days
she
passes
the
time
in
a
special
hut
whither
her
husband
brings
her
food
and
at
the
end
of
the
time
she
takes
a
bath
and
resumes
her
usual
occupations
so
among
the
indians
of
the
mosquito
territory
in
central
america
when
a
woman
is
in
her
courses
she
must
quit
the
village
for
seven
or
eight
days
a
small
hut
is
built
for
her
in
the
wood
and
at
night
some
of
the
village
girls
go
and
sleep
with
her
to
keep
her
company
or
if
the
nights
are
dark
and
jaguars
are
known
to
be
prowling
in
the
neighbourhood
her
husband
will
take
his
gun
or
bow
and
sleep
in
a
hammock
near
her
she
may
neither
handle
nor
cook
food
all
is
prepared
and
carried
to
her
when
the
sickness
is
over
she
bathes
in
the
river
puts
on
clean
clothes
and
returns
to
her
household
duties
among
the
indians
of
costa
rica
a
girl
at
her
first
menstruation
retires
to
a
hut
built
for
the
purpose
in
the
forest
and
there
she
must
stay
till
she
has
been
purified
by
a
who
breathes
on
her
and
places
various
objects
such
as
feathers
the
beaks
of
birds
the
teeth
of
beasts
and
so
forth
upon
her
body
a
married
woman
at
her
periods
remains
in
the
house
with
her
husband
but
she
is
reckoned
unclean
and
must
avoid
all
intimate
relations
with
him
she
uses
for
plates
only
banana
leaves
which
when
she
has
done
with
them
she
throws
away
in
a
sequestered
spot
for
should
a
cow
find
and
eat
them
the
animal
would
waste
away
and
perish
also
she
drinks
only
out
of
a
special
vessel
because
any
person
who
should
afterwards
drink
out
of
the
same
vessel
would
infallibly
pine
away
and
die
among
most
tribes
of
north
american
indians
the
custom
was
that
women
in
their
courses
retired
from
the
camp
or
the
village
and
lived
during
the
time
of
their
uncleanness
in
special
huts
or
shelters
which
were
appropriated
to
their
use
there
they
dwelt
apart
eating
and
sleeping
by
themselves
warming
themselves
at
their
own
fires
and
strictly
abstaining
from
all
communications
with
men
who
shunned
them
just
as
if
they
were
stricken
with
the
plague
no
article
of
furniture
used
in
these
menstrual
huts
might
be
used
in
any
other
not
even
the
flint
and
steel
with
which
in
the
old
days
the
fires
were
kindled
no
one
would
borrow
a
light
from
a
woman
in
her
seclusion
if
a
white
man
in
his
ignorance
asked
to
light
his
pipe
at
her
fire
she
would
refuse
to
grant
the
request
telling
him
that
it
would
make
his
nose
bleed
and
his
head
ache
and
that
he
would
fall
sick
in
consequence
if
an
indian
s
wooden
pipe
cracked
his
friends
would
think
that
he
had
either
lit
it
at
one
of
these
polluted
fires
or
had
held
some
converse
with
a
woman
during
her
retirement
which
was
esteemed
a
most
disgraceful
and
wicked
thing
to
do
decent
men
would
not
approach
within
a
certain
distance
of
a
woman
at
such
times
and
if
they
had
to
convey
anything
to
her
they
would
stand
some
forty
or
fifty
paces
off
and
throw
it
to
her
everything
which
was
touched
by
her
hands
during
this
period
was
deemed
ceremonially
unclean
indeed
her
touch
was
thought
to
convey
such
pollution
that
if
she
chanced
to
lay
a
finger
on
a
chief
s
lodge
or
his
gun
or
anything
else
belonging
to
him
it
would
be
instantly
destroyed
if
she
crossed
the
path
of
a
hunter
or
a
warrior
his
luck
for
that
day
at
least
would
be
gone
were
she
not
thus
secluded
it
was
supposed
that
the
men
would
be
attacked
by
diseases
of
various
kinds
which
would
prove
mortal
in
some
tribes
a
woman
who
infringed
the
rules
of
separation
might
have
to
answer
with
her
life
for
any
misfortunes
that
might
happen
to
individuals
or
to
the
tribe
in
consequence
as
it
was
supposed
of
her
criminal
negligence
when
she
quitted
her
tent
or
hut
to
go
into
retirement
the
fire
in
it
was
extinguished
and
the
ashes
thrown
away
outside
of
the
village
and
a
new
fire
was
kindled
as
if
the
old
one
had
been
defiled
by
her
presence
at
the
end
of
their
seclusion
the
women
bathed
in
running
streams
and
returned
to
their
usual
occupations
thus
to
take
examples
the
creek
and
kindred
indians
of
the
united
states
compelled
women
at
menstruation
to
live
in
separate
huts
at
some
distance
from
the
village
there
the
women
had
to
stay
at
the
risk
of
being
surprised
and
cut
off
by
enemies
it
was
thought
a
most
horrid
and
dangerous
pollution
to
go
near
the
women
at
such
times
and
the
danger
extended
to
enemies
who
if
they
slew
the
women
had
to
cleanse
themselves
from
the
pollution
by
means
of
certain
sacred
herbs
and
roots
similarly
the
choctaw
women
had
to
quit
their
huts
during
their
monthly
periods
and
might
not
return
till
after
they
had
been
purified
while
their
uncleanness
lasted
they
had
to
prepare
their
own
food
the
men
believed
that
if
they
were
to
approach
a
menstruous
woman
they
would
fall
ill
and
that
some
mishap
would
overtake
them
when
they
went
to
the
wars
when
an
omaha
woman
has
her
courses
on
her
she
retires
from
the
family
to
a
little
shelter
of
bark
or
grass
supported
by
sticks
where
she
kindles
a
fire
and
cooks
her
victuals
alone
her
seclusion
lasts
four
days
during
this
time
she
may
not
approach
or
touch
a
horse
for
the
indians
believe
that
such
contamination
would
impoverish
or
weaken
the
animal
among
the
potawatomis
the
women
at
their
monthly
periods
are
not
allowed
to
associate
with
the
rest
of
the
nation
they
are
completely
laid
aside
and
are
not
permitted
to
touch
any
article
of
furniture
or
food
which
the
men
have
occasion
to
use
if
the
indians
be
stationary
at
the
time
the
women
are
placed
outside
of
the
camp
if
on
a
march
they
are
not
allowed
to
follow
the
trail
but
must
take
a
different
path
and
keep
at
a
distance
from
the
main
among
the
cheyennes
menstruous
women
slept
in
special
lodges
the
men
believed
that
if
they
slept
with
their
wives
at
such
times
they
would
probably
be
wounded
in
their
next
battle
a
man
who
owned
a
shield
had
very
particularly
to
be
on
his
guard
against
women
in
their
courses
he
might
not
go
into
a
lodge
where
one
of
them
happened
to
be
nor
even
into
a
lodge
where
one
of
them
had
been
until
a
ceremony
of
purification
had
been
performed
sweet
grass
and
juniper
were
burnt
in
the
tent
and
the
pegs
were
pulled
up
and
the
covering
thrown
back
as
if
the
tent
were
about
to
be
struck
after
this
pretence
of
decamping
from
the
polluted
spot
the
owner
of
the
shield
might
enter
the
tent
the
stseelis
indians
of
british
columbia
imagined
that
if
a
menstruous
woman
were
to
step
over
a
bundle
of
arrows
the
arrows
would
thereby
be
rendered
useless
and
might
even
cause
the
death
of
their
owner
and
similarly
that
if
she
passed
in
front
of
a
hunter
who
carried
a
gun
the
weapon
would
never
shoot
straight
again
neither
her
husband
nor
her
father
would
dream
of
going
out
to
hunt
while
she
was
in
this
state
and
even
if
he
had
wished
to
do
so
the
other
hunters
would
not
go
with
him
hence
to
keep
them
out
of
harm
s
way
the
women
both
married
and
unmarried
were
secluded
at
these
times
for
four
days
in
shelters
among
the
thompson
indians
of
british
columbia
every
woman
had
to
isolate
herself
from
the
rest
of
the
people
during
every
recurring
period
of
menstruation
and
had
to
live
some
little
way
off
in
a
small
brush
or
bark
lodge
made
for
the
purpose
at
these
times
she
was
considered
unclean
must
use
cooking
and
eating
utensils
of
her
own
and
was
supplied
with
food
by
some
other
woman
if
she
smoked
out
of
a
pipe
other
than
her
own
that
pipe
would
ever
afterwards
be
hot
to
smoke
if
she
crossed
in
front
of
a
gun
that
gun
would
thenceforth
be
useless
for
the
war
or
the
chase
unless
indeed
the
owner
promptly
washed
the
weapon
in
medecine
or
struck
the
woman
with
it
once
on
each
principal
part
of
her
body
if
a
man
ate
or
had
any
intercourse
with
a
menstruous
woman
nay
if
he
merely
wore
clothes
or
mocassins
made
or
patched
by
her
he
would
have
bad
luck
in
hunting
and
the
bears
would
attack
him
fiercely
before
being
admitted
again
among
the
people
she
had
to
change
all
her
clothes
and
wash
several
times
in
clear
water
the
clothes
worn
during
her
isolation
were
hung
on
a
tree
to
be
used
next
time
or
to
be
washed
for
one
day
after
coming
back
among
the
people
she
did
not
cook
food
were
a
man
to
eat
food
cooked
by
a
woman
at
such
times
he
would
have
incapacitated
himself
for
hunting
and
exposed
himself
to
sickness
or
death
among
the
chippeways
and
other
indians
of
the
hudson
bay
territory
menstruous
women
are
excluded
from
the
camp
and
take
up
their
abode
in
huts
of
branches
they
wear
long
hoods
which
effectually
conceal
the
head
and
breast
they
may
not
touch
the
household
furniture
nor
any
objects
used
by
men
for
their
touch
is
supposed
to
defile
them
so
that
their
subsequent
use
would
be
followed
by
certain
mischief
or
misfortune
such
as
disease
or
death
they
must
drink
out
of
a
swan
s
bone
they
may
not
walk
on
the
common
paths
nor
cross
the
tracks
of
animals
they
are
never
permitted
to
walk
on
the
ice
of
rivers
or
lakes
or
near
the
part
where
the
men
are
hunting
beaver
or
where
a
is
set
for
fear
of
averting
their
success
they
are
also
prohibited
at
those
times
from
partaking
of
the
head
of
any
animal
and
even
from
walking
in
or
crossing
the
track
where
the
head
of
a
deer
moose
beaver
and
many
other
animals
have
lately
been
carried
either
on
a
sledge
or
on
the
back
to
be
guilty
of
a
violation
of
this
custom
is
considered
as
of
the
greatest
importance
because
they
firmly
believe
that
it
would
be
a
means
of
preventing
the
hunter
from
having
an
equal
success
in
his
future
so
the
lapps
forbid
women
at
menstruation
to
walk
on
that
part
of
the
shore
where
the
fishers
are
in
the
habit
of
setting
out
their
fish
and
the
esquimaux
of
bering
strait
believe
that
if
hunters
were
to
come
near
women
in
their
courses
they
would
catch
no
game
but
the
beliefs
and
superstitions
of
this
sort
that
prevail
among
the
western
tribes
of
the
great
déné
or
tinneh
stock
to
which
the
chippeways
belong
have
been
so
well
described
by
an
experienced
missionary
that
i
will
give
his
description
in
his
own
words
prominent
among
the
ceremonial
rites
of
these
indians
he
says
are
the
observances
peculiar
to
the
fair
sex
and
many
of
them
are
remarkably
analogous
to
those
practised
by
the
hebrew
women
so
much
so
that
were
it
not
savouring
of
profanity
the
ordinances
of
the
déné
ritual
code
might
be
termed
a
new
edition
revised
and
considerably
augmented
of
the
mosaic
ceremonial
law
among
the
carriers
as
soon
as
a
girl
has
experienced
the
first
flow
of
the
menses
which
in
the
female
constitution
are
a
natural
discharge
her
father
believed
himself
under
the
obligation
of
atoning
for
her
supposedly
sinful
condition
by
a
small
impromptu
distribution
of
clothes
among
the
natives
this
periodical
state
of
women
was
considered
as
one
of
legal
impurity
fateful
both
to
the
man
who
happened
to
have
any
intercourse
however
indirect
with
her
and
to
the
woman
herself
who
failed
in
scrupulously
observing
all
the
rites
prescribed
by
ancient
usage
for
persons
in
her
condition
upon
entering
into
that
stage
of
her
life
the
maiden
was
immediately
sequestered
from
company
even
that
of
her
parents
and
compelled
to
dwell
in
a
small
branch
hut
by
herself
away
from
beaten
paths
and
the
gaze
of
as
she
was
supposed
to
exercise
malefic
influence
on
any
man
who
might
inadvertently
glance
at
her
she
had
to
wear
a
sort
of
combining
in
itself
the
purposes
of
a
veil
a
bonnet
and
a
mantlet
it
was
made
of
tanned
skin
its
forepart
was
shaped
like
a
long
fringe
completely
hiding
from
view
the
face
and
breasts
then
it
formed
on
the
head
a
cap
or
bonnet
and
finally
fell
in
a
broad
band
almost
to
the
heels
this
was
made
and
publicly
placed
on
her
head
by
a
paternal
aunt
who
received
at
once
some
present
from
the
girl
s
father
when
three
or
four
years
later
the
period
of
sequestration
ceased
only
this
same
aunt
had
the
right
to
take
off
her
niece
s
ceremonial
furthermore
the
girl
s
fingers
wrists
and
legs
at
the
ankles
and
immediately
below
the
knees
were
encircled
with
ornamental
rings
and
bracelets
of
sinew
intended
as
a
protection
against
the
malign
influences
she
was
supposed
to
be
possessed
with
to
a
belt
girding
her
waist
were
suspended
two
bone
implements
called
respectively
bone
tube
and
head
scratcher
the
former
was
a
hollowed
swan
bone
to
drink
with
any
other
mode
of
drinking
being
unlawful
to
her
the
latter
was
and
was
called
into
requisition
whenever
she
wanted
to
scratch
her
contact
of
the
fingers
with
the
head
being
reputed
injurious
to
her
health
while
thus
secluded
she
was
called
that
is
interred
alive
in
carrier
and
she
had
to
submit
to
a
rigorous
fast
and
abstinence
her
only
allowed
food
consisted
of
dried
fish
boiled
in
a
small
bark
vessel
which
nobody
else
must
touch
and
she
had
to
abstain
especially
from
meat
of
any
kind
as
well
as
fresh
fish
nor
was
this
all
she
had
to
endure
even
her
contact
however
remote
with
these
two
articles
of
diet
was
so
dreaded
that
she
could
not
cross
the
public
paths
or
trails
or
the
tracks
of
animals
whenever
absolute
necessity
constrained
her
to
go
beyond
such
spots
she
had
to
be
packed
or
carried
over
them
lest
she
should
contaminate
the
game
or
meat
which
had
passed
that
way
or
had
been
brought
over
these
paths
and
also
for
the
sake
of
against
tabooed
and
consequently
to
her
deleterious
food
in
the
same
way
she
was
never
allowed
to
wade
in
streams
or
lakes
for
fear
of
causing
death
to
the
fish
it
was
also
a
prescription
of
the
ancient
ritual
code
for
females
during
this
primary
condition
to
eat
as
little
as
possible
and
to
remain
lying
down
especially
in
course
of
each
monthly
flow
not
only
as
a
natural
consequence
of
the
prolonged
fast
and
resulting
weakness
but
chiefly
as
an
exhibition
of
a
becoming
penitential
spirit
which
was
believed
to
be
rewarded
by
long
life
and
continual
good
health
in
after
years
these
mortifications
or
seclusion
did
not
last
less
than
three
or
four
years
useless
to
say
that
during
all
that
time
marriage
could
not
be
thought
of
since
the
girl
could
not
so
much
as
be
seen
by
men
when
married
the
same
sequestration
was
practised
relatively
to
husband
and
the
particular
and
rings
spoken
the
occasion
of
every
recurring
menstruation
sometimes
it
was
protracted
as
long
as
ten
days
at
a
time
especially
during
the
first
years
of
cohabitation
even
when
she
returned
to
her
mate
she
was
not
permitted
to
sleep
with
him
on
the
first
nor
frequently
on
the
second
night
but
would
choose
a
distant
corner
of
the
lodge
to
spread
her
blanket
as
if
afraid
to
defile
him
with
her
dread
elsewhere
the
same
writer
tells
us
that
most
of
the
devices
to
which
these
indians
used
to
resort
for
the
sake
of
ensuring
success
in
the
chase
were
based
on
their
regard
for
continence
and
their
excessive
repugnance
for
and
dread
of
menstruating
but
the
strict
observances
imposed
on
tinneh
or
déné
women
at
such
times
were
designed
at
the
same
time
to
protect
the
women
themselves
from
the
evil
consequences
of
their
dangerous
condition
thus
it
was
thought
that
women
in
their
courses
could
not
partake
of
the
head
heart
or
hind
part
of
an
animal
that
had
been
caught
in
a
snare
without
exposing
themselves
to
a
premature
death
through
a
kind
of
rabies
they
might
not
cut
or
carve
salmon
because
to
do
so
would
seriously
endanger
their
health
and
especially
would
enfeeble
their
arms
for
life
and
they
had
to
abstain
from
cutting
up
the
grebes
which
are
caught
by
the
carriers
in
great
numbers
every
spring
because
otherwise
the
blood
with
which
these
fowls
abound
would
occasion
hæmorrhage
or
an
unnaturally
prolonged
flux
in
the
transgressor
similarly
indian
women
of
the
thompson
tribe
abstained
from
venison
and
the
flesh
of
other
large
game
during
menstruation
lest
the
animals
should
be
displeased
and
the
menstrual
flow
increased
for
a
similar
reason
probably
shuswap
girls
during
their
seclusion
at
puberty
are
forbidden
to
eat
anything
that
bleeds
the
same
principle
may
perhaps
partly
explain
the
rule
of
which
we
have
had
some
examples
that
women
at
such
times
should
refrain
from
fish
and
flesh
and
restrict
themselves
to
a
vegetable
diet
the
philosophic
student
of
human
nature
will
observe
or
learn
without
surprise
that
ideas
thus
deeply
ingrained
in
the
savage
mind
reappear
at
a
more
advanced
stage
of
society
in
those
elaborate
codes
which
have
been
drawn
up
for
the
guidance
of
certain
peoples
by
lawgivers
who
claim
to
have
derived
the
rules
they
inculcate
from
the
direct
inspiration
of
the
deity
however
we
may
explain
it
the
resemblance
which
exists
between
the
earliest
official
utterances
of
the
deity
and
the
ideas
of
savages
is
unquestionably
close
and
remarkable
whether
it
be
as
some
suppose
that
god
communed
face
to
face
with
man
in
those
early
days
or
as
others
maintain
that
man
mistook
his
wild
and
wandering
thoughts
for
a
revelation
from
heaven
be
that
as
it
may
certain
it
is
that
the
natural
uncleanness
of
woman
at
her
monthly
periods
is
a
conception
which
has
occurred
or
been
revealed
with
singular
unanimity
to
several
ancient
legislators
the
hindoo
lawgiver
manu
who
professed
to
have
received
his
institutes
from
the
creator
brahman
informs
us
that
the
wisdom
the
energy
the
strength
the
sight
and
the
vitality
of
a
man
who
approaches
a
woman
in
her
courses
will
utterly
perish
whereas
if
he
avoids
her
his
wisdom
energy
strength
sight
and
vitality
will
all
increase
the
persian
lawgiver
zoroaster
who
if
we
can
take
his
word
for
it
derived
his
code
from
the
mouth
of
the
supreme
being
ahura
mazda
devoted
special
attention
to
the
subject
according
to
him
the
menstrous
flow
at
least
in
its
abnormal
manifestations
is
a
work
of
ahriman
or
the
devil
therefore
so
long
as
it
lasts
a
woman
is
unclean
and
possessed
of
the
demon
she
must
be
kept
confined
apart
from
the
faithful
whom
her
touch
would
defile
and
from
the
fire
which
her
very
look
would
injure
she
is
not
allowed
to
eat
as
much
as
she
wishes
as
the
strength
she
might
acquire
would
accrue
to
the
fiends
her
food
is
not
given
her
from
hand
to
hand
but
is
passed
to
her
from
a
distance
in
a
long
leaden
the
hebrew
lawgiver
moses
whose
divine
legation
is
as
little
open
to
question
as
that
of
manu
and
zoroaster
treats
the
subject
at
still
greater
length
but
i
must
leave
to
the
reader
the
task
of
comparing
the
inspired
ordinances
on
this
head
with
the
merely
human
regulations
of
the
carrier
indians
which
they
so
closely
resemble
amongst
the
civilized
nations
of
europe
the
superstitions
which
cluster
round
this
mysterious
aspect
of
woman
s
nature
are
not
less
extravagant
than
those
which
prevail
among
savages
in
the
oldest
existing
of
list
of
dangers
apprehended
from
menstruation
is
longer
than
any
furnished
by
mere
barbarians
according
to
pliny
the
touch
of
a
menstruous
woman
turned
wine
to
vinegar
blighted
crops
killed
seedlings
blasted
gardens
brought
down
the
fruit
from
trees
dimmed
mirrors
blunted

rusted
iron
and

especially
at
the
waning
of
the
moon
killed
bees
or
at
least
drove
them
from
their
hives
caused
mares
to
miscarry
and
so
forth
similarly
in
various
parts
of
europe
it
is
still
believed
that
if
a
woman
in
her
courses
enters
a
brewery
the
beer
will
turn
sour
if
she
touches
beer
wine
vinegar
or
milk
it
will
go
bad
if
she
makes
jam
it
will
not
keep
if
she
mounts
a
mare
it
will
miscarry
if
she
touches
buds
they
will
wither
if
she
climbs
a
cherry
tree
it
will
die
in
brunswick
people
think
that
if
a
menstruous
woman
assists
at
the
killing
of
a
pig
the
pork
will
putrefy
in
the
greek
island
of
calymnos
a
woman
at
such
times
may
not
go
to
the
well
to
draw
water
nor
cross
a
running
stream
nor
enter
the
sea
her
presence
in
a
boat
is
said
to
raise
storms
thus
the
object
of
secluding
women
at
menstruation
is
to
neutralize
the
dangerous
influences
which
are
supposed
to
emanate
from
them
at
such
times
that
the
danger
is
believed
to
be
especially
great
at
the
first
menstruation
appears
from
the
unusual
precautions
taken
to
isolate
girls
at
this
crisis
two
of
these
precautions
have
been
illustrated
above
namely
the
rules
that
the
girl
may
not
touch
the
ground
nor
see
the
sun
the
general
effect
of
these
rules
is
to
keep
her
suspended
so
to
say
between
heaven
and
earth
whether
enveloped
in
her
hammock
and
slung
up
to
the
roof
as
in
south
america
or
raised
above
the
ground
in
a
dark
and
narrow
cage
as
in
new
ireland
she
may
be
considered
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
doing
mischief
since
being
shut
off
both
from
the
earth
and
from
the
sun
she
can
poison
neither
of
these
great
sources
of
life
by
her
deadly
contagion
in
short
she
is
rendered
harmless
by
being
in
electrical
language
insulated
but
the
precautions
thus
taken
to
isolate
or
insulate
the
girl
are
dictated
by
a
regard
for
her
own
safety
as
well
as
for
the
safety
of
others
for
it
is
thought
that
she
herself
would
suffer
if
she
were
to
neglect
the
prescribed
regimen
thus
zulu
girls
as
we
have
seen
believe
that
they
would
shrivel
to
skeletons
if
the
sun
were
to
shine
on
them
at
puberty
and
in
some
brazilian
tribes
the
young
women
think
that
a
transgression
of
the
rules
would
entail
sores
on
the
neck
and
throat
in
short
the
girl
is
viewed
as
charged
with
a
powerful
force
which
if
not
kept
within
bounds
may
prove
destructive
both
to
herself
and
to
all
with
whom
she
comes
in
contact
to
repress
this
force
within
the
limits
necessary
for
the
safety
of
all
concerned
is
the
object
of
the
taboos
in
question
the
same
explanation
applies
to
the
observance
of
the
same
rules
by
divine
kings
and
priests
the
uncleanness
as
it
is
called
of
girls
at
puberty
and
the
sanctity
of
holy
men
do
not
to
the
primitive
mind
differ
materially
from
each
other
they
are
only
different
manifestations
of
the
same
mysterious
energy
which
like
energy
in
general
is
in
itself
neither
good
nor
bad
but
becomes
beneficent
or
maleficent
according
to
its
application
accordingly
if
like
girls
at
puberty
divine
personages
may
neither
touch
the
ground
nor
see
the
sun
the
reason
is
on
the
one
hand
a
fear
lest
their
divinity
might
at
contact
with
earth
or
heaven
discharge
itself
with
fatal
violence
on
either
and
on
the
other
hand
an
apprehension
that
the
divine
being
thus
drained
of
his
ethereal
virtue
might
thereby
be
incapacitated
for
the
future
performance
of
those
magical
functions
upon
the
proper
discharge
of
which
the
safety
of
the
people
and
even
of
the
world
is
believed
to
hang
thus
the
rules
in
question
fall
under
the
head
of
the
taboos
which
we
examined
in
the
second
part
of
this
work
they
are
intended
to
preserve
the
life
of
the
divine
person
and
with
it
the
life
of
his
subjects
and
worshippers
nowhere
it
is
thought
can
his
precious
yet
dangerous
life
be
at
once
so
safe
and
so
harmless
as
when
it
is
neither
in
heaven
nor
in
earth
but
as
far
as
possible
suspended
between
the
two
in
legends
and
which
reflect
the
ideas
of
earlier
ages
we
find
this
suspension
between
heaven
and
earth
attributed
to
beings
who
have
been
endowed
with
the
coveted
yet
burdensome
gift
of
immortality
the
wizened
remains
of
the
deathless
sibyl
are
said
to
have
been
preserved
in
a
jar
or
urn
which
hung
in
a
temple
of
apollo
at
cumae
and
when
a
group
of
merry
children
tired
perhaps
of
playing
in
the
sunny
streets
sought
the
shade
of
the
temple
and
amused
themselves
by
gathering
underneath
the
familiar
jar
and
calling
out
sibyl
what
do
you
wish
a
hollow
voice
like
an
echo
used
to
answer
from
the
urn
i
wish
to
a
story
taken
down
from
the
lips
of
a
german
peasant
at
thomsdorf
relates
that
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
girl
in
london
who
wished
to
live
for
ever
so
they
say
london
is
a
fine
maiden
prayed
to
live
for
and
still
she
lives
and
hangs
in
a
basket
in
a
church
and
every
john
s
day
about
the
hour
of
noon
she
eats
a
roll
of
bread
another
german
story
tells
of
a
lady
who
resided
at
danzig
and
was
so
rich
and
so
blest
with
all
that
life
can
give
that
she
wished
to
live
always
so
when
she
came
to
her
latter
end
she
did
not
really
die
but
only
looked
like
dead
and
very
soon
they
found
her
in
a
hollow
of
a
pillar
in
the
church
half
standing
and
half
sitting
motionless
she
stirred
never
a
limb
but
they
saw
quite
plainly
that
she
was
alive
and
she
sits
there
down
to
this
blessed
day
every
new
year
s
day
the
sacristan
comes
and
puts
a
morsel
of
the
holy
bread
in
her
mouth
and
that
is
all
she
has
to
live
on
long
long
has
she
rued
her
fatal
wish
who
set
this
transient
life
above
the
eternal
joys
of
heaven
a
third
german
story
tells
of
a
noble
damsel
who
cherished
the
same
foolish
wish
for
immortality
so
they
put
her
in
a
basket
and
hung
her
up
in
a
church
and
there
she
hangs
and
never
dies
though
many
a
year
has
come
and
gone
since
they
put
her
there
but
every
year
on
a
certain
day
they
give
her
a
roll
and
she
eats
it
and
cries
out
for
ever
for
ever
for
ever
and
when
she
has
so
cried
she
falls
silent
again
till
the
same
time
next
year
and
so
it
will
go
on
for
ever
and
for
ever
a
fourth
story
taken
down
near
oldenburg
in
holstein
tells
of
a
jolly
dame
that
ate
and
drank
and
lived
right
merrily
and
had
all
that
heart
could
desire
and
she
wished
to
live
always
for
the
first
hundred
years
all
went
well
but
after
that
she
began
to
shrink
and
shrivel
up
till
at
last
she
could
neither
walk
nor
stand
nor
eat
nor
drink
but
die
she
could
not
at
first
they
fed
her
as
if
she
were
a
little
child
but
when
she
grew
smaller
and
smaller
they
put
her
in
a
glass
bottle
and
hung
her
up
in
the
church
and
there
she
still
hangs
in
the
church
of
mary
at
lübeck
she
is
as
small
as

chapter
iii
the
myth
of
balder
a
deity
whose
life
might
in
a
sense
be
said
to
be
neither
in
heaven
nor
on
earth
but
between
the
two
was
the
norse
balder
the
good
and
beautiful
god
the
son
of
the
great
god
odin
and
himself
the
wisest
mildest
best
beloved
of
all
the
immortals
the
story
of
his
death
as
it
is
told
in
the
younger
or
prose
runs
thus
once
on
a
time
balder
dreamed
heavy
dreams
which
seemed
to
forebode
his
death
thereupon
the
gods
held
a
council
and
resolved
to
make
him
secure
against
every
danger
so
the
goddess
frigg
took
an
oath
from
fire
and
water
iron
and
all
metals
stones
and
earth
from
trees
sicknesses
and
poisons
and
from
all
beasts
birds
and
creeping
things
that
they
would
not
hurt
balder
when
this
was
done
balder
was
deemed
invulnerable
so
the
gods
amused
themselves
by
setting
him
in
their
midst
while
some
shot
at
him
others
hewed
at
him
and
others
threw
stones
at
him
but
whatever
they
did
nothing
could
hurt
him
and
at
this
they
were
all
glad
only
loki
the
was
displeased
and
he
went
in
the
guise
of
an
old
woman
to
frigg
who
told
him
that
the
weapons
of
the
gods
could
not
wound
balder
since
she
had
made
them
all
swear
not
to
hurt
him
then
loki
asked
have
all
things
sworn
to
spare
balder
she
answered
east
of
walhalla
grows
a
plant
called
mistletoe
it
seemed
to
me
too
young
to
so
loki
went
and
pulled
the
mistletoe
and
took
it
to
the
assembly
of
the
gods
there
he
found
the
blind
god
hother
standing
at
the
outside
of
the
circle
loki
asked
him
why
do
you
not
shoot
at
balder
hother
answered
because
i
do
not
see
where
he
stands
besides
i
have
no
then
said
loki
do
like
the
rest
and
shew
balder
honour
as
they
all
do
i
will
shew
you
where
he
stands
and
do
you
shoot
at
him
with
this
hother
took
the
mistletoe
and
threw
it
at
balder
as
loki
directed
him
the
mistletoe
struck
balder
and
pierced
him
through
and
through
and
he
fell
down
dead
and
that
was
the
greatest
misfortune
that
ever
befell
gods
and
men
for
a
while
the
gods
stood
speechless
then
they
lifted
up
their
voices
and
wept
bitterly
they
took
balder
s
body
and
brought
it
to
the
there
stood
balder
s
ship
it
was
called
ringhorn
and
was
the
hugest
of
all
ships
the
gods
wished
to
launch
the
ship
and
to
burn
balder
s
body
on
it
but
the
ship
would
not
stir
so
they
sent
for
a
giantess
called
hyrrockin
she
came
riding
on
a
wolf
and
gave
the
ship
such
a
push
that
fire
flashed
from
the
rollers
and
all
the
earth
shook
then
balder
s
body
was
taken
and
placed
on
the
funeral
pile
upon
his
ship
when
his
wife
nanna
saw
that
her
heart
burst
for
sorrow
and
she
died
so
she
was
laid
on
the
funeral
pile
with
her
husband
and
fire
was
put
to
it
balder
s
horse
too
with
all
its
trappings
was
burned
on
the
pile
in
the
older
or
poetic
the
tragic
tale
of
balder
is
hinted
at
rather
than
told
at
length
among
the
visions
which
the
norse
sibyl
sees
and
describes
in
the
weird
prophecy
known
as
the
is
one
of
the
fatal
mistletoe
i
behold
says
she
fate
looming
for
balder
woden
s
son
the
bloody
victim
there
stands
the
mistletoe
slender
and
delicate
blooming
high
above
the
ground
out
of
this
shoot
so
slender
to
look
on
there
shall
grow
a
harmful
fateful
shaft

shall
shoot

but
frigga
in
shall
weep
over
the
woe
of
yet
looking
far
into
the
future
the
sibyl
sees
a
brighter
vision
of
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
where
the
fields
unsown
shall
yield
their
increase
and
all
sorrows
shall
be
healed
then
balder
will
come
back
to
dwell
in
odin
s
mansions
of
bliss
in
a
hall
brighter
than
the
sun
shingled
with
gold
where
the
righteous
shall
live
in
joy
for
ever
more
writing
about
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
the
old
danish
historian
saxo
grammaticus
tells
the
story
of
balder
in
a
form
which
professes
to
be
historical
according
to
him
balder
and
hother
were
rival
suitors
for
the
hand
of
nanna
daughter
of
gewar
king
of
norway
now
balder
was
a
demigod
and
common
steel
could
not
wound
his
sacred
body
the
two
rivals
encountered
each
other
in
a
terrific
battle
and
though
odin
and
thor
and
the
rest
of
the
gods
fought
for
balder
yet
was
he
defeated
and
fled
away
and
hother
married
the
princess
nevertheless
balder
took
heart
of
grace
and
again
met
hother
in
a
stricken
field
but
he
fared
even
worse
than
before
for
hother
dealt
him
a
deadly
wound
with
a
magic
sword
which
he
had
received
from
miming
the
satyr
of
the
woods
and
after
lingering
three
days
in
pain
balder
died
of
his
hurt
and
was
buried
with
royal
honours
in
a
barrow
whether
he
was
a
real
or
merely
a
mythical
personage
balder
was
worshipped
in
norway
on
one
of
the
bays
of
the
beautiful
sogne
fiord
which
penetrates
far
into
the
depths
of
the
solemn
norwegian
mountains
with
their
sombre
and
their
lofty
cascades
dissolving
into
spray
before
they
reach
the
dark
water
of
the
fiord
far
below
balder
had
a
great
sanctuary
it
was
called
balder
s
grove
a
palisade
enclosed
the
hallowed
ground
and
within
it
stood
a
spacious
temple
with
the
images
of
many
gods
but
none
of
them
was
worshipped
with
such
devotion
as
balder
so
great
was
the
awe
with
which
the
heathen
regarded
the
place
that
no
man
might
harm
another
there
nor
steal
his
cattle
nor
defile
himself
with
women
but
women
cared
for
the
images
of
the
gods
in
the
temple
they
warmed
them
at
the
fire
anointed
them
with
oil
and
dried
them
with
cloths
it
might
be
rash
to
affirm
that
the
romantic
figure
of
balder
was
nothing
but
a
creation
of
the
mythical
fancy
a
radiant
phantom
conjured
up
as
by
a
wizard
s
wand
to
glitter
for
a
time
against
the
gloomy
background
of
the
stern
norwegian
landscape
it
may
be
so
yet
it
is
also
possible
that
the
myth
was
founded
on
the
tradition
of
a
hero
popular
and
beloved
in
his
lifetime
who
long
survived
in
the
memory
of
the
people
gathering
more
and
more
of
the
marvellous
about
him
as
he
passed
from
generation
to
generation
of
at
all
events
it
is
worth
while
to
observe
that
a
somewhat
similar
story
is
told
of
another
national
hero
who
may
well
have
been
a
real
man
in
his
great
poem
epic
of
which
is
founded
on
persian
traditions
the
poet
firdusi
tells
us
that
in
the
combat
between
rustem
and
isfendiyar
the
arrows
of
the
former
did
no
harm
to
his
adversary
because
zerdusht
had
charmed
his
body
against
all
dangers
so
that
it
was
like
unto
but
simurgh
the
bird
of
god
shewed
rustem
the
way
he
should
follow
in
order
to
vanquish
his
redoubtable
foe
he
rode
after
her
and
they
halted
not
till
they
came
to
the
there
she
led
him
into
a
garden
where
grew
a
tamarisk
tall
and
strong
and
the
roots
thereof
were
in
the
ground
but
the
branches
pierced
even
unto
the
sky
then
the
bird
of
god
bade
rustem
break
from
the
tree
a
branch
that
was
long
and
slender
and
fashion
it
into
an
arrow
and
she
said
only
through
his
eyes
can
isfendiyar
be
wounded
if
therefore
thou
wouldst
slay
him
direct
this
arrow
unto
his
forehead
and
verily
it
shall
not
miss
its
rustem
did
as
he
was
bid
and
when
next
he
fought
with
isfendiyar
he
shot
the
arrow
at
him
and
it
pierced
his
eye
and
he
died
great
was
the
mourning
for
isfendiyar
for
the
space
of
one
year
men
ceased
not
to
lament
for
him
and
for
many
years
they
shed
bitter
tears
for
that
arrow
and
they
said
the
glory
of
iran
hath
been
laid
whatever
may
be
thought
of
an
historical
kernel
underlying
a
mythical
husk
in
the
legend
of
balder
the
details
of
the
story
suggest
that
it
belongs
to
that
class
of
myths
which
have
been
dramatized
in
ritual
or
to
put
it
otherwise
which
have
been
performed
as
magical
ceremonies
for
the
sake
of
producing
those
natural
effects
which
they
describe
in
figurative
language
a
myth
is
never
so
graphic
and
precise
in
its
details
as
when
it
is
so
to
speak
the
book
of
the
words
which
are
spoken
and
acted
by
the
performers
of
the
sacred
rite
that
the
norse
story
of
balder
was
a
myth
of
this
sort
will
become
probable
if
we
can
prove
that
ceremonies
resembling
the
incidents
in
the
tale
have
been
performed
by
norsemen
and
other
european
peoples
now
the
main
incidents
in
the
tale
are
the
pulling
of
the
mistletoe
and
second
the
death
and
burning
of
the
god
and
both
of
them
may
perhaps
be
found
to
have
had
their
counterparts
in
yearly
rites
observed
whether
separately
or
conjointly
by
people
in
various
parts
of
europe
these
rites
will
be
described
and
discussed
in
the
following
chapters
we
shall
begin
with
the
annual
festivals
of
fire
and
shall
reserve
the
pulling
of
the
mistletoe
for
consideration
later
on
chapter
iv
the
of
europe
the
lenten
fires
all
over
europe
the
peasants
have
been
accustomed
from
time
immemorial
to
kindle
bonfires
on
certain
days
of
the
year
and
to
dance
round
or
leap
over
them
customs
of
this
kind
can
be
traced
back
on
historical
evidence
to
the
middle
ages
and
their
analogy
to
similar
customs
observed
in
antiquity
goes
with
strong
internal
evidence
to
prove
that
their
origin
must
be
sought
in
a
period
long
prior
to
the
spread
of
christianity
indeed
the
earliest
proof
of
their
observance
in
northern
europe
is
furnished
by
the
attempts
made
by
christian
synods
in
the
eighth
century
to
put
them
down
as
heathenish
rites
not
uncommonly
effigies
are
burned
in
these
fires
or
a
pretence
is
made
of
burning
a
living
person
in
them
and
there
are
grounds
for
believing
that
anciently
human
beings
were
actually
burned
on
these
occasions
a
general
survey
of
the
customs
in
question
will
bring
out
the
traces
of
human
sacrifice
and
will
serve
at
the
same
time
to
throw
light
on
their
meaning
the
seasons
of
the
year
when
these
bonfires
are
most
commonly
lit
are
spring
and
midsummer
but
in
some
places
they
are
kindled
also
at
the
end
of
autumn
or
during
the
course
of
the
winter
particularly
on
hallow
e
en
the
of
october
christmas
day
and
the
eve
of
twelfth
day
we
shall
consider
them
in
the
order
in
which
they
occur
in
the
calendar
year
the
earliest
of
them
is
the
winter
festival
of
the
eve
of
twelfth
day
the
fifth
of
january
but
as
it
has
been
already
described
in
an
earlier
part
of
this
work
we
shall
pass
it
over
here
and
begin
with
the
of
spring
which
usually
fall
on
the
first
sunday
of
lent
or
easter
eve
and
may
day
the
custom
of
kindling
bonfires
on
the
first
sunday
in
lent
has
prevailed
in
belgium
the
north
of
france
and
many
parts
of
germany
thus
in
the
belgian
ardennes
for
a
week
or
a
fortnight
before
the
day
of
the
great
fire
as
it
is
called
children
go
about
from
farm
to
farm
collecting
fuel
at
grand
halleux
any
one
who
refuses
their
request
is
pursued
next
day
by
the
children
who
try
to
blacken
his
face
with
the
ashes
of
the
extinct
fire
when
the
day
has
come
they
cut
down
bushes
especially
juniper
and
broom
and
in
the
evening
great
bonfires
blaze
on
all
the
heights
it
is
a
common
saying
that
seven
bonfires
should
be
seen
if
the
village
is
to
be
safe
from
conflagrations
if
the
meuse
happens
to
be
frozen
hard
at
the
time
bonfires
are
lit
also
on
the
ice
at
grand
halleux
they
set
up
a
pole
called
or
the
witch
in
the
midst
of
the
pile
and
the
fire
is
kindled
by
the
man
who
was
last
married
in
the
village
in
the
neighbourhood
of
morlanwelz
a
straw
man
is
burnt
in
the
fire
young
people
and
children
dance
and
sing
round
the
bonfires
and
leap
over
the
embers
to
secure
good
crops
or
a
happy
marriage
within
the
year
or
as
a
means
of
guarding
themselves
against
colic
in
brabant
on
the
same
sunday
down
to
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
women
and
men
disguised
in
female
attire
used
to
go
with
burning
torches
to
the
fields
where
they
danced
and
sang
comic
songs
for
the
purpose
as
they
alleged
of
driving
away
the
wicked
sower
who
is
mentioned
in
the
gospel
for
the
day
at
maeseyck
and
in
many
villages
of
limburg
on
the
evening
of
the
day
children
run
through
the
streets
carrying
lighted
torches
then
they
kindle
little
fires
of
straw
in
the
fields
and
dance
round
them
at
ensival
old
folks
tell
young
folks
that
they
will
have
as
many
easter
eggs
as
they
see
bonfires
on
this
day
at
pâturages
in
the
province
of
hainaut
down
to
about
the
custom
was
observed
under
the
name
of
or
every
year
on
the
first
sunday
of
lent
which
was
called
the
day
of
the
little
scouvion
young
folks
and
children
used
to
run
with
lighted
torches
through
the
gardens
and
orchards
as
they
ran
they
cried
at
the
pitch
of
their
voices
apples
bear
cherries
all
scouvion
at
these
words
the
whirled
his
blazing
brand
and
hurled
it
among
the
branches
of
the
the
and
the
the
next
sunday
was
called
the
day
of
the
great
scouvion
and
the
same
race
with
lighted
torches
among
the
trees
of
the
orchards
was
repeated
in
the
afternoon
till
darkness
fell
the
same
custom
was
observed
on
the
same
two
days
at
wasmes
in
the
neighbourhood
of
liège
where
the
lenten
fires
were
put
down
by
the
police
about
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
girls
thought
that
by
leaping
over
the
fires
without
being
smirched
they
made
sure
of
a
happy
marriage
elsewhere
in
order
to
get
a
good
husband
it
was
necessary
to
see
seven
of
the
bonfires
from
one
spot
in
famenne
a
district
of
namur
men
and
cattle
who
traversed
the
lenten
fires
were
thought
to
be
safe
from
sickness
and
witchcraft
anybody
who
saw
seven
such
fires
at
once
had
nothing
to
fear
from
sorcerers
an
old
saying
ran
that
if
you
do
not
light
the
great
fire
god
will
light
it
for
you
which
seems
to
imply
that
the
kindling
of
the
bonfires
was
deemed
a
protection
against
conflagrations
throughout
the
year
in
the
french
department
of
the
ardennes
the
whole
village
used
to
dance
and
sing
round
the
bonfires
which
were
lighted
on
the
first
sunday
in
lent
here
too
it
was
the
person
last
married
sometimes
a
man
and
sometimes
a
woman
who
put
the
match
to
the
fire
the
custom
is
still
kept
up
very
commonly
in
the
district
cats
used
to
be
burnt
in
the
fire
or
roasted
to
death
by
being
held
over
it
and
while
they
were
burning
the
shepherds
drove
their
flocks
through
the
smoke
and
flames
as
a
sure
means
of
guarding
them
against
sickness
and
witchcraft
in
some
communes
it
was
believed
that
the
livelier
the
dance
round
the
fire
the
better
would
be
the
crops
that
year
in
the
vosges
mountains
it
is
still
customary
to
light
great
fires
on
the
heights
and
around
the
villages
on
the
first
sunday
in
lent
and
at
rupt
and
elsewhere
the
right
of
kindling
them
belongs
to
the
person
who
was
last
married
round
the
fires
the
people
dance
and
sing
merrily
till
the
flames
have
died
out
then
the
master
of
the
fire
as
they
call
the
man
who
kindled
it
invites
all
who
contributed
to
the
erection
of
the
pile
to
follow
him
to
the
nearest
tavern
where
they
partake
of
good
cheer
at
dommartin
they
say
that
if
you
would
have
the
hemp
tall
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
the
women
should
be
tipsy
on
the
evening
of
this
day
at
épinal
in
the
vosges
on
the
first
sunday
in
lent
bonfires
used
to
be
kindled
at
various
places
both
in
the
town
and
on
the
banks
of
the
moselle
they
consisted
of
pyramids
of
sticks
and
faggots
which
had
been
collected
some
days
earlier
by
young
folks
going
from
door
to
door
when
the
flames
blazed
up
the
names
of
various
couples
whether
young
or
old
handsome
or
ugly
rich
or
poor
were
called
out
and
the
persons
thus
linked
in
mock
marriage
were
forced
whether
they
liked
it
or
not
to
march
arm
in
arm
round
the
fire
amid
the
laughter
and
jests
of
the
crowd
the
festivity
lasted
till
the
fire
died
out
and
then
the
spectators
dispersed
through
the
streets
stopping
under
the
windows
of
the
houses
and
proclaiming
the
names
of
the
and
or
valentines
whom
the
popular
voice
had
assigned
to
each
other
these
couples
had
to
exchange
presents
the
mock
bridegroom
gave
his
mock
bride
something
for
her
toilet
while
she
in
turn
presented
him
with
a
cockade
of
coloured
ribbon
next
sunday
if
the
weather
allowed
it
all
the
couples
arrayed
in
their
best
attire
and
attended
by
their
relations
repaired
to
the
wood
of
saint
antony
where
they
mounted
a
famous
stone
called
the
or
here
they
found
cakes
and
refreshments
of
all
sorts
and
danced
to
the
music
of
a
couple
of
fiddlers
the
evening
bell
ringing
the
angelus
gave
the
signal
to
depart
as
soon
as
its
solemn
chime
was
heard
every
one
quitted
the
forest
and
returned
home
the
exchange
of
presents
between
the
valentines
went
by
the
name
of
ransom
or
redemption
because
it
was
supposed
to
redeem
the
couple
from
the
flames
of
the
bonfire
any
pair
who
failed
thus
to
ransom
themselves
were
not
suffered
to
share
the
merrymaking
at
the
great
stone
in
the
forest
and
a
pretence
was
made
of
burning
them
in
small
fires
kindled
before
their
own
doors
in
the
french
province
of
to
the
west
of
the
jura
mountains
the
first
sunday
of
lent
is
known
as
the
sunday
of
the
firebrands
on
account
of
the
fires
which
it
is
customary
to
kindle
on
that
day
on
the
saturday
or
the
sunday
the
village
lads
harness
themselves
to
a
cart
and
drag
it
about
the
streets
stopping
at
the
doors
of
the
houses
where
there
are
girls
and
begging
for
a
faggot
when
they
have
got
enough
they
cart
the
fuel
to
a
spot
at
some
little
distance
from
the
village
pile
it
up
and
set
it
on
fire
all
the
people
of
the
parish
come
out
to
see
the
bonfire
in
some
villages
when
the
bells
have
rung
the
angelus
the
signal
for
the
observance
is
given
by
cries
of
to
the
fire
to
the
fire
lads
lasses
and
children
dance
round
the
blaze
and
when
the
flames
have
died
down
they
vie
with
each
other
in
leaping
over
the
red
embers
he
or
she
who
does
so
without
singeing
his
or
her
garments
will
be
married
within
the
year
young
folk
also
carry
lighted
torches
about
the
streets

the
fields

when
they
pass
an
orchard
they
cry
out
more
fruit

in
the
department
of
doubs
it
was
the
young
married
couples
of
the
year
who
had
charge
of
the
bonfires
in
the
midst
of
the
bonfire
a
pole
was
planted
with
a
wooden
figure
of
a
cock
fastened
to
the
top
then
there
were
races
and
the
winner
received
the
cock
as
a
prize
in
auvergne
fires
are
everywhere
kindled
on
the
evening
of
the
first
sunday
in
lent
every
village
every
hamlet
even
every
ward
every
isolated
farm
has
its
bonfire
or
as
it
is
called
which
blazes
up
as
the
shades
of
night
are
falling
the
fires
may
be
seen
flaring
on
the
heights
and
in
the
plains
the
people
dance
and
sing
round
about
them
and
leap
through
the
flames
then
they
proceed
to
the
ceremony
of
the
a
is
a
torch
of
straw
fastened
to
the
top
of
a
pole
when
the
pyre
is
half
consumed
the
bystanders
kindle
the
torches
at
the
expiring
flames
and
carry
them
into
the
neighbouring
orchards
fields
and
gardens
wherever
there
are
as
they
march
they
sing
at
the
top
of
their
voices
mo
mio
mon
pouère
mo
mouère
that
is
grannus
my
friend
grannus
my
father
grannus
my
then
they
pass
the
burning
torches
under
the
branches
of
every
tree
singing
brantso
in
plan
panei
that
is
firebrand
burn
every
branch
a
basketful
in
some
villages
the
people
also
run
across
the
sown
fields
and
shake
the
ashes
of
the
torches
on
the
ground
also
they
put
some
of
the
ashes
in
the
fowls
nests
in
order
that
the
hens
may
lay
plenty
of
eggs
throughout
the
year
when
all
these
ceremonies
have
been
performed
everybody
goes
home
and
feasts
the
special
dishes
of
the
evening
are
fritters
and
pancakes
here
the
application
of
the
fire
to
the
to
the
sown
fields
and
to
the
nests
of
the
poultry
is
clearly
a
charm
intended
to
ensure
fertility
and
the
granno
to
whom
the
invocations
are
addressed
and
who
gives
his
name
to
the
torches
may
possibly
be
as
pommerol
suggests
no
other
than
the
ancient
celtic
god
grannus
whom
the
romans
identified
with
apollo
and
whose
worship
is
attested
by
inscriptions
found
not
only
in
france
but
in
scotland
and
on
the
danube
if
the
name
grannus
is
derived
as
the
learned
tell
us
from
a
root
meaning
to
glow
burn
shine
the
deity
who
bore
the
name
and
was
identified
with
apollo
may
well
have
been
a
and
in
that
case
the
prayers
addressed
to
him
by
the
peasants
of
the
auvergne
while
they
wave
the
blazing
crackling
torches
about
the
would
be
eminently
appropriate
for
who
could
ripen
the
fruit
so
well
as
the
and
what
better
process
could
be
devised
to
draw
the
blossoms
from
the
bare
boughs
than
the
application
to
them
of
that
genial
warmth
which
is
ultimately
derived
from
the
solar
beams
thus
the
of
the
first
sunday
in
lent
as
it
is
observed
in
auvergne
may
be
interpreted
very
naturally
and
simply
as
a
religious
or
rather
perhaps
magical
ceremony
designed
to
procure
a
due
supply
of
the
sun
s
heat
for
plants
and
animals
at
the
same
time
we
should
remember
that
the
employment
of
fire
in
this
and
kindred
ceremonies
may
have
been
designed
originally
not
so
much
to
stimulate
growth
and
reproduction
as
to
burn
and
destroy
all
agencies
whether
in
the
shape
of
vermin
witches
or
what
not
which
threatened
or
were
supposed
to
threaten
the
growth
of
the
crops
and
the
multiplication
of
animals
it
is
often
difficult
to
decide
between
these
two
different
interpretations
of
the
use
of
fire
in
agricultural
rites
in
any
case
the
of
auvergne
on
the
first
sunday
in
lent
may
date
from
druidical
times
the
custom
of
carrying
lighted
torches
of
straw
about
the
orchards
and
fields
to
fertilize
them
on
the
first
sunday
of
lent
seems
to
have
been
common
in
france
whether
it
was
accompanied
with
the
practice
of
kindling
bonfires
or
not
thus
in
the
province
of
picardy
on
the
first
sunday
of
lent
people
carried
torches
through
the
fields
exorcising
the
the
darnel
and
the
smut
they
imagined
that
they
did
much
good
to
the
gardens
and
caused
the
onions
to
grow
large
children
ran
about
the
fields
torch
in
hand
to
make
the
land
more
fertile
all
that
was
done
habitually
in
picardy
and
the
ceremony
of
the
torches
is
not
entirely
forgotten
especially
in
the
villages
on
both
sides
the
somme
as
far
as
a
very
agreeable
spectacle
said
the
curate
of
l
étoile
is
to
survey
from
the
portal
of
the
church
situated
almost
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
the
vast
plains
of
vimeux
all
illuminated
by
these
wandering
fires
the
same
pastime
is
observed
at
poix
at
conty
and
in
all
the
villages
round
again
in
the
district
of
beauce
a
festival
of
torches
or
used
to
be
held
both
on
the
first
and
on
the
second
sunday
in
lent
the
first
was
called
the
great
torches
and
the
second
the
little
the
torches
were
as
usual
bundles
of
straw
wrapt
round
poles
in
the
evening
the
village
lads
carried
the
burning
brands
through
the
country
running
about
in
disorder
and
singing
these
vines
at
this
wheat
the
maidens
that
shall
wed
from
time
to
time
the
bearers
would
stand
still
and
smite
the
earth
all
together
with
the
blazing
straw
of
the
torches
while
they
cried
a
sheaf
of
a
peck
and
a
half
à
if
two
torchbearers
happened
to
meet
each
other
on
their
rounds
they
performed
the
same
ceremony
and
uttered
the
same
words
when
the
straw
was
burnt
out
the
poles
were
collected
and
a
great
bonfire
made
of
them
lads
and
lasses
danced
round
the
flames
and
the
lads
leaped
over
them
afterwards
it
was
customary
to
eat
a
special
sort
of
made
of
wheaten
flour
these
usages
were
still
in
vogue
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
but
they
have
now
almost
disappeared
the
peasants
believed
that
by
carrying
lighted
torches
through
the
fields
they
protected
the
crops
from
darnel
and
smut
at
dijon
in
burgundy
it
is
the
custom
upon
the
first
sunday
in
lent
to
make
large
fires
in
the
streets
whence
it
is
called
firebrand
sunday
this
practice
originated
in
the
processions
formerly
made
on
that
day
by
the
peasants
with
lighted
torches
of
straw
to
drive
away
as
they
called
it
the
bad
air
from
the
in
some
parts
of
france
while
the
people
scoured
the
country
with
burning
brands
on
the
first
sunday
in
lent
they
warned
the
that
if
they
did
not
take
heed
and
bear
fruit
they
would
surely
be
cut
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
on
the
same
day
peasants
in
the
department
of
loiret
used
to
run
about
the
sowed
fields
with
burning
torches
in
their
hands
while
they
adjured
the
to
quit
the
wheat
on
pain
of
having
their
whiskers
burned
in
the
department
of
ain
the
great
fires
of
straw
and
faggots
which
are
kindled
in
the
fields
at
this
time
are
or
were
supposed
to
destroy
the
nests
of
the
caterpillars
at
verges
a
lonely
village
surrounded
by
forests
between
the
jura
and
the
combe
d
ain
the
torches
used
at
this
season
were
kindled
in
a
peculiar
manner
the
young
people
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
mountain
where
they
placed
three
nests
of
straw
in
three
trees
these
nests
being
then
set
on
fire
torches
made
of
dry
were
lighted
at
them
and
the
merry
troop
descended
the
mountain
to
their
flickering
light
and
went
to
every
house
in
the
village
demanding
roasted
peas
and
obliging
all
couples
who
had
been
married
within
the
year
to
dance
in
berry
a
district
of
central
france
it
appears
that
bonfires
are
not
lighted
on
this
day
but
when
the
sun
has
set
the
whole
population
of
the
villages
armed
with
blazing
torches
of
straw
disperse
over
the
country
and
scour
the
fields
the
vineyards
and
the
orchards
seen
from
afar
the
multitude
of
moving
lights
twinkling
in
the
darkness
appear
like
chasing
each
other
across
the
plains
along
the
hillsides
and
down
the
valleys
while
the
men
wave
their
flambeaus
about
the
branches
of
the
the
women
and
children
tie
bands
of
round
the
the
effect
of
the
ceremony
is
supposed
to
be
to
avert
the
various
plagues
from
which
the
fruits
of
the
earth
are
apt
to
suffer
and
the
bands
of
straw
fastened
round
the
stems
of
the
trees
are
believed
to
render
them
fruitful
in
the
peninsula
of
la
manche
the
norman
peasants
used
to
spend
almost
the
whole
night
of
the
first
sunday
in
lent
rushing
about
the
country
with
lighted
torches
for
the
purpose
as
they
supposed
of
driving
away
the
moles
and
fires
were
also
kindled
on
some
of
the
dolmens
in
germany
austria
and
switzerland
at
the
same
season
similar
customs
have
prevailed
thus
in
the
eifel
mountains
rhenish
prussia
on
the
first
sunday
in
lent
young
people
used
to
collect
straw
and
brushwood
from
house
to
house
these
they
carried
to
an
eminence
and
piled
up
round
a
tall
slim
to
which
a
piece
of
wood
was
fastened
at
right
angles
to
form
a
cross
the
structure
was
known
as
the
hut
or
fire
was
set
to
it
and
the
young
people
marched
round
the
blazing
castle
bareheaded
each
carrying
a
lighted
torch
and
praying
aloud
sometimes
a
was
burned
in
the
people
observed
the
direction
in
which
the
smoke
blew
from
the
fire
if
it
blew
towards
the
it
was
a
sign
that
the
harvest
would
be
abundant
on
the
same
day
in
some
parts
of
the
eifel
a
great
wheel
was
made
of
straw
and
dragged
by
three
horses
to
the
top
of
a
hill
thither
the
village
boys
marched
at
nightfall
set
fire
to
the
wheel
and
sent
it
rolling
down
the
slope
two
lads
followed
it
with
levers
to
set
it
in
motion
again
in
case
it
should
anywhere
meet
with
a
check
at
oberstattfeld
the
wheel
had
to
be
provided
by
the
young
man
who
was
last
married
about
echternach
in
luxemburg
the
same
ceremony
is
called
burning
the
witch
while
it
is
going
on
the
older
men
ascend
the
heights
and
observe
what
wind
is
blowing
for
that
is
the
wind
which
will
prevail
the
whole
year
at
voralberg
in
the
tyrol
on
the
first
sunday
in
lent
a
slender
young
is
surrounded
with
a
pile
of
straw
and
firewood
to
the
top
of
the
tree
is
fastened
a
human
figure
called
the
witch
made
of
old
clothes
and
stuffed
with
gunpowder
at
night
the
whole
is
set
on
fire
and
boys
and
girls
dance
round
it
swinging
torches
and
singing
rhymes
in
which
the
words
corn
in
the
the
plough
in
the
earth
may
be
distinguished
in
swabia
on
the
first
sunday
in
lent
a
figure
called
the
witch
or
the
old
wife
or
winter
s
grandmother
is
made
up
of
clothes
and
fastened
to
a
pole
this
is
stuck
in
the
middle
of
a
pile
of
wood
to
which
fire
is
applied
while
the
witch
is
burning
the
young
people
throw
blazing
discs
into
the
air
the
discs
are
thin
round
pieces
of
wood
a
few
inches
in
diameter
with
notched
edges
to
imitate
the
rays
of
the
sun
or
stars
they
have
a
hole
in
the
middle
by
which
they
are
attached
to
the
end
of
a
wand
before
the
disc
is
thrown
it
is
set
on
fire
the
wand
is
swung
to
and
fro
and
the
impetus
thus
communicated
to
the
disc
is
augmented
by
dashing
the
rod
sharply
against
a
sloping
board
the
burning
disc
is
thus
thrown
off
and
mounting
high
into
the
air
describes
a
long
fiery
curve
before
it
reaches
the
ground
a
single
lad
may
fling
up
forty
or
fifty
of
these
discs
one
after
the
other
the
object
is
to
throw
them
as
high
as
possible
the
wand
by
which
they
are
hurled
must
at
least
in
some
parts
of
swabia
be
of
hazel
sometimes
the
lads
also
leap
over
the
fire
brandishing
lighted
torches
of
the
charred
embers
of
the
burned
witch
and
discs
are
taken
home
and
planted
in
the
the
same
night
in
the
belief
that
they
will
keep
vermin
from
the
fields
at
wangen
near
molsheim
in
baden
a
like
custom
is
observed
on
the
first
sunday
in
lent
the
young
people
kindle
a
bonfire
on
the
crest
of
the
mountain
above
the
village
and
the
burning
discs
which
they
hurl
into
the
air
are
said
to
present
in
the
darkness
the
aspect
of
a
continual
shower
of
falling
stars
when
the
supply
of
discs
is
exhausted
and
the
bonfire
begins
to
burn
low
the
boys
light
torches
and
run
with
them
at
full
speed
down
one
or
other
of
the
three
steep
and
winding
paths
that
descend
the
to
the
village
bumps
bruises
and
scratches
are
often
the
result
of
their
efforts
to
outstrip
each
other
in
the
headlong
race
in
the
rhön
mountains
situated
on
the
borders
of
hesse
and
bavaria
the
people
used
to
march
to
the
top
of
a
hill
or
eminence
on
the
first
sunday
in
lent
children
and
lads
carried
torches
brooms
daubed
with
tar
and
poles
swathed
in
straw
a
wheel
wrapt
in
combustibles
was
kindled
and
rolled
down
the
hill
and
the
young
people
rushed
about
the
fields
with
their
burning
torches
and
brooms
till
at
last
they
flung
them
in
a
heap
and
standing
round
them
struck
up
a
hymn
or
a
popular
song
the
object
of
running
about
the
fields
with
the
blazing
torches
was
to
drive
away
the
wicked
or
it
was
done
in
honour
of
the
virgin
that
she
might
preserve
the
fruits
of
the
earth
throughout
the
year
and
bless
them
in
neighbouring
villages
of
hesse
between
the
rhön
and
the
vogel
mountains
it
is
thought
that
wherever
the
burning
wheels
roll
the
fields
will
be
safe
from
hail
and
storm
at
konz
on
the
moselle
on
the
thursday
before
the
first
sunday
in
lent
the
two
guilds
of
the
butchers
and
the
weavers
used
to
repair
to
the
marxberg
and
there
set
up
an
with
a
wheel
fastened
to
it
on
the
following
sunday
the
people
ascended
the
hill
cut
down
the
oak
set
fire
to
the
wheel
and
sent
both
oak
and
wheel
rolling
down
the
hillside
while
a
guard
of
butchers
mounted
on
horses
fired
at
the
flaming
wheel
in
its
descent
if
the
wheel
rolled
down
into
the
moselle
the
butchers
were
rewarded
with
a
of
wine
by
the
archbishop
of
treves
in
switzerland
also
it
is
or
used
to
be
customary
to
kindle
bonfires
on
high
places
on
the
evening
of
the
first
sunday
in
lent
and
the
day
is
therefore
popularly
known
as
spark
sunday
the
custom
prevailed
for
example
throughout
the
canton
of
lucerne
boys
went
about
from
house
to
house
begging
for
wood
and
straw
then
piled
the
fuel
on
a
conspicuous
mountain
or
hill
round
about
a
pole
which
bore
a
straw
effigy
called
the
at
nightfall
the
pile
was
set
on
fire
and
the
young
folks
danced
wildly
round
it
some
of
them
cracking
whips
or
ringing
bells
and
when
the
fire
burned
low
enough
they
leaped
over
it
this
was
called
burning
the
in
some
parts
of
the
canton
also
they
used
to
wrap
old
wheels
in
straw
and
thorns
put
a
light
to
them
and
send
them
rolling
and
blazing
down
hill
the
same
custom
of
rolling
lighted
wheels
down
hill
is
attested
by
old
authorities
for
the
cantons
of
aargau
and
bâle
the
more
bonfires
could
be
seen
sparkling
and
flaring
in
the
darkness
the
more
fruitful
was
the
year
expected
to
be
and
the
higher
the
dancers
leaped
beside
or
over
the
fire
the
higher
it
was
thought
would
grow
the
flax
in
the
district
of
freiburg
and
at
birseck
in
the
district
of
bâle
it
was
the
last
married
man
or
woman
who
must
kindle
the
bonfire
while
the
bonfires
blazed
up
it
was
customary
in
some
parts
of
switzerland
to
propel
burning
discs
of
wood
through
the
air
by
means
of
the
same
simple
machinery
which
is
used
for
the
purpose
in
swabia
each
lad
tried
to
send
his
disc
fizzing
and
flaring
through
the
darkness
as
far
as
possible
and
in
discharging
it
he
mentioned
the
name
of
the
person
to
whose
honour
it
was
dedicated
but
in
prättigau
the
words
uttered
in
launching
the
fiery
discs
referred
to
the
abundance
which
was
apparently
expected
to
follow
the
performance
of
the
ceremony
among
them
were
grease
in
the
pan
corn
in
the
fan
and
the
plough
in
the
earth
it
seems
hardly
possible
to
separate
from
these
bonfires
kindled
on
the
first
sunday
in
lent
the
fires
in
which
about
the
same
season
the
effigy
called
death
is
burned
as
part
of
the
ceremony
of
carrying
out
we
have
seen
that
at
spachendorf
in
austrian
silesia
on
the
morning
of
rupert
s
day
shrove
tuesday
a
dressed
in
a
fur
coat
and
a
fur
cap
is
laid
in
a
hole
outside
the
village
and
there
burned
and
that
while
it
is
blazing
every
one
seeks
to
snatch
a
fragment
of
it
which
he
fastens
to
a
branch
of
the
highest
tree
in
his
garden
or
buries
in
his
field
believing
that
this
will
make
the
crops
to
grow
better
the
ceremony
is
known
as
the
burying
of
even
when
the
is
not
designated
as
death
the
meaning
of
the
observance
is
probably
the
same
for
the
name
death
as
i
have
tried
to
shew
does
not
express
the
original
intention
of
the
ceremony
at
cobern
in
the
eifel
mountains
the
lads
make
up
a
on
shrove
tuesday
the
effigy
is
formally
tried
and
accused
of
having
perpetrated
all
the
thefts
that
have
been
committed
in
the
neighbourhood
throughout
the
year
being
condemned
to
death
the
is
led
through
the
village
shot
and
burned
upon
a
pyre
they
dance
round
the
blazing
pile
and
the
last
bride
must
leap
over
it
in
oldenburg
on
the
evening
of
shrove
tuesday
people
used
to
make
long
bundles
of
straw
which
they
set
on
fire
and
then
ran
about
the
fields
waving
them
shrieking
and
singing
wild
songs
finally
they
burned
a
on
the
field
in
the
district
of
düsseldorf
the
burned
on
shrove
tuesday
was
made
of
an
unthreshed
sheaf
of
corn
on
the
first
monday
after
the
spring
equinox
the
urchins
of
zurich
drag
a
on
a
little
cart
through
the
streets
while
at
the
same
time
the
girls
carry
about
a

vespers
ring
the
is
burned
in
the
district
of
aachen
on
ash
wednesday
a
man
used
to
be
encased
in
and
taken
to
an
appointed
place
here
he
slipped
quietly
out
of
his
straw
casing
which
was
then
burned
the
children
thinking
that
it
was
the
man
who
was
being
burned
in
the
val
di
ledro
tyrol
on
the
last
day
of
the
carnival
a
figure
is
made
up
of
straw
and
brushwood
and
then
burned
the
figure
is
called
the
old
woman
and
the
ceremony
burning
the
old
the
easter
fires
another
occasion
on
which
these
are
held
is
easter
eve
the
saturday
before
easter
sunday
on
that
day
it
has
been
customary
in
catholic
countries
to
extinguish
all
the
lights
in
the
churches
and
then
to
make
a
new
fire
sometimes
with
flint
and
steel
sometimes
with
a
at
this
fire
is
lit
the
great
paschal
or
easter
candle
which
is
then
used
to
rekindle
all
the
extinguished
lights
in
the
church
in
many
parts
of
germany
a
bonfire
is
also
kindled
by
means
of
the
new
fire
on
some
open
space
near
the
church
it
is
consecrated
and
the
people
bring
sticks
of
oak
walnut
and
beech
which
they
char
in
the
fire
and
then
take
home
with
them
some
of
these
charred
sticks
are
thereupon
burned
at
home
in
a
fire
with
a
prayer
that
god
will
preserve
the
homestead
from
fire
lightning
and
hail
thus
every
house
receives
new
some
of
the
sticks
are
kept
throughout
the
year
and
laid
on
the
during
heavy
to
prevent
the
house
from
being
struck
by
lightning
or
they
are
inserted
in
the
roof
with
the
like
intention
others
are
placed
in
the
fields
gardens
and
meadows
with
a
prayer
that
god
will
keep
them
from
blight
and
hail
such
fields
and
gardens
are
thought
to
thrive
more
than
others
the
corn
and
the
plants
that
grow
in
them
are
not
beaten
down
by
hail
nor
devoured
by
mice
vermin
and
beetles
no
witch
harms
them
and
the
ears
of
corn
stand
close
and
full
the
charred
sticks
are
also
applied
to
the
plough
the
ashes
of
the
easter
bonfire
together
with
the
ashes
of
the
consecrated
are
mixed
with
the
seed
at
sowing
a
wooden
figure
called
judas
is
sometimes
burned
in
the
consecrated
bonfire
and
even
where
this
custom
has
been
abolished
the
bonfire
itself
in
some
places
goes
by
the
name
of
the
burning
of
in
the
hollertau
bavaria
the
young
men
used
to
light
their
lanterns
at
the
easter
candle
in
the
church
and
then
race
to
the
bonfire
he
who
reached
it
first
set
fire
to
the
pile
and
next
day
easter
sunday
was
rewarded
at
the
by
the
housewives
who
presented
him
with
red
eggs
great
was
the
jubilation
while
the
effigy
of
the
traitor
was
being
consumed
in
the
flames
the
ashes
were
carefully
collected
and
thrown
away
at
sunrise
in
running
water
in
many
parts
of
the
abruzzi
also
pious
people
kindle
their
fires
on
easter
saturday
with
a
brand
brought
from
the
sacred
new
fire
in
the
church
when
the
brand
has
thus
served
to
bless
the
fire
on
the
domestic
hearth
it
is
extinguished
and
the
remainder
is
preserved
partly
in
a
cranny
of
the
outer
wall
of
the
house
partly
on
a
tree
to
which
it
is
tied
this
is
done
for
the
purpose
of
guarding
the
homestead
against
injury
by
storms
at
campo
di
giove
the
people
say
that
if
you
can
get
a
piece
of
one
of
the
three
holy
candles
which
the
priest
lights
from
the
new
fire
you
should
allow
a
few
drops
of
the
wax
to
fall
into
the
crown
of
your
hat
for
after
that
if
it
should
thunder
and
lighten
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
clap
the
hat
on
your
head
and
no
flash
of
lightning
can
possibly
strike
you
further
it
deserves
to
be
noted
that
in
the
abruzzi
water
as
well
as
fire
is
as
it
were
renewed
and
consecrated
on
easter
saturday
most
people
fetch
holy
water
on
that
day
from
the
churches
and
every
member
of
the
family
drinks
a
little
of
it
believing
that
it
has
power
to
protect
him
or
her
against
witchcraft
fever
and
of
all
sorts
and
when
the
church
bells
ring
again
after
their
enforced
silence
the
water
is
sprinkled
about
the
house
and
especially
under
the
beds
with
the
help
of
a
some
of
this
blessed
water
is
also
kept
in
the
house
for
use
in
great
emergencies
when
there
is
no
time
to
fetch
a
priest
thus
it
may
be
employed
to
baptize
a
infant
gasping
for
life
or
to
sprinkle
a
sick
man
in
the
last
agony
such
a
sprinkling
is
reckoned
equal
to
priestly
absolution
in
calabria
the
customs
with
regard
to
the
new
water
as
it
is
called
on
easter
saturday
are
similar
it
is
poured
into
a
new
vessel
adorned
with
ribbons
and
flowers
is
blessed
by
the
priest
and
is
tasted
by
every
one
of
the
household
beginning
with
the
parents
and
when
the
air
vibrates
with
the
glad
music
of
the
church
bells
announcing
the
resurrection
the
people
sprinkle
the
holy
water
about
the
houses
bidding
in
a
loud
voice
all
evil
things
to
go
forth
and
all
good
things
to
come
in
at
the
same
time
to
emphasize
the
exorcism
they
knock
on
doors
chests
and
other
domestic
articles
of
furniture
at
cetraro
people
who
suffer
from
diseases
of
the
skin
bathe
in
the
sea
at
this
propitious
moment
at
pietro
in
guarano
they
plunge
into
the
river
on
the
night
of
easter
saturday
before
easter
sunday
dawns
and
while
they
bathe
they
utter
never
a
word
moreover
the
calabrians
keep
the
new
water
as
a
sacred
thing
they
believe
that
it
serves
as
a
protection
against
witchcraft
if
it
is
sprinkled
on
a
fire
or
a
lamp
when
the
wood
crackles
or
the
wick
sputters
for
they
regard
it
as
a
bad
omen
when
the
fire
talks
as
they
say
among
the
germans
of
western
bohemia
also
water
as
well
as
fire
is
consecrated
by
the
priest
in
front
of
the
church
on
easter
saturday
people
bring
jugs
full
of
water
to
the
church
and
set
them
beside
the
holy
fire
afterwards
they
use
the
water
to
sprinkle
on
the
which
are
stuck
in
the
fields
charred
sticks
of
the
judas
fire
as
it
is
popularly
called
are
supposed
to
possess
a
magical
and
healing
virtue
hence
the
people
take
them
home
with
them
and
even
scuffle
with
each
other
for
the
still
glowing
embers
in
order
to
carry
them
still
glimmering
to
their
houses
and
so
obtain
the
light
or
the
holy
at
hildesheim
also
and
the
neighbouring
villages
of
central
germany
rites
both
of
fire
and
water
are
or
were
till
lately
observed
at
easter
thus
on
easter
night
many
people
fetch
water
from
the
innerste
river
and
keep
it
carefully
believing
it
to
be
a
remedy
for
many
sorts
of
ailments
both
of
man
and
beast
in
the
villages
on
the
leine
river
servant
men
and
maids
used
to
go
silently
on
easter
night
between
the
hours
of
eleven
and
twelve
and
silently
draw
water
in
buckets
from
the
river
they
mixed
the
water
with
the
fodder
and
the
drink
of
the
cattle
to
make
the
animals
thrive
and
they
imagined
that
to
wash
in
it
was
good
for
human
beings
many
were
also
of
opinion
that
at
the
same
mystic
hour
the
water
turned
to
wine
as
far
as
the
crowing
of
a
cock
could
be
heard
and
in
this
belief
they
laid
themselves
flat
on
their
stomachs
and
kept
their
tongues
in
the
water
till
the
miraculous
change
occurred
when
they
took
a
great
gulp
of
the
transformed
water
at
hildesheim
too
and
the
neighbouring
villages
fires
used
to
blaze
on
all
the
heights
on
easter
eve
and
embers
taken
from
the
bonfires
were
dipped
in
the
cattle
troughs
to
benefit
the
beasts
and
were
kept
in
the
houses
to
avert
lightning
in
the
lesachthal
carinthia
all
the
fires
in
the
houses
used
to
be
extinguished
on
easter
saturday
and
rekindled
with
a
fresh
fire
brought
from
the
churchyard
where
the
priest
had
lit
it
by
the
friction
of
flint
and
steel
and
had
bestowed
his
blessing
on
it
such
customs
were
probably
widespread
in
a
latin
poem
of
the
sixteenth
century
written
by
a
certain
thomas
kirchmeyer
and
translated
into

herewith
all
the
hungrie
times
of
fasting
ended
it
is
said
that
formerly
all
the
fires
in
rome
were
lighted
afresh
from
the
holy
fire
kindled
in
peter
s
on
easter
saturday
in
florence
the
ceremony
of
kindling
the
new
fire
on
easter
eve
is
peculiar
the
holy
flame
is
elicited
from
certain
flints
which
are
said
to
have
been
brought
by
a
member
of
the
pazzi
family
from
the
holy
land
they
are
kept
in
the
church
of
the
holy
apostles
on
the
piazza
del
limbo
and
on
the
morning
of
easter
saturday
the
prior
strikes
fire
from
them
and
lights
a
candle
from
the
new
flame
the
burning
candle
is
then
carried
in
solemn
procession
by
the
clergy
and
members
of
the
municipality
to
the
high
altar
in
the
cathedral
a
vast
crowd
has
meanwhile
assembled
in
the
cathedral
and
the
neighbouring
square
to
witness
the
ceremony
amongst
the
spectators
are
many
peasants
drawn
from
the
surrounding
country
for
it
is
commonly
believed
that
on
the
success
or
failure
of
the
ceremony
depends
the
fate
of
the
crops
for
the
year
outside
the
door
of
the
cathedral
stands
a
festal
car
drawn
by
two
fine
white
oxen
with
gilded
horns
the
body
of
the
car
is
loaded
with
a
pyramid
of
squibs
and
crackers
and
is
connected
by
a
wire
with
a
pillar
set
up
in
front
of
the
high
altar
the
wire
extends
down
the
middle
of
the
nave
at
a
height
of
about
six
feet
from
the
ground
beneath
it
a
clear
passage
is
left
the
spectators
being
ranged
on
either
side
and
crowding
the
vast
interior
from
wall
to
wall
when
all
is
ready
high
mass
is
celebrated
and
precisely
at
noon
when
the
first
words
of
the
are
being
chanted
the
sacred
fire
is
applied
to
the
pillar
which
like
the
car
is
wreathed
with
fireworks
a
moment
more
and
a
fiery
dove
comes
flying
down
the
nave
with
a
hissing
sound
and
a
sputter
of
sparks
between
the
two
hedges
of
eager
spectators
if
all
goes
well
the
bird
pursues
its
course
along
the
wire
and
out
at
the
door
and
in
another
moment
a
prolonged
series
of
fizzes
pops
and
bangs
announces
to
the
excited
crowd
in
the
cathedral
that
the
fireworks
on
the
car
are
going
off
great
is
the
joy
accordingly
especially
among
the
bumpkins
who
are
now
sure
of
an
abundant
harvest
but
if
as
sometimes
happens
the
dove
stops
short
in
its
career
and
fizzles
out
revealing
itself
as
a
stuffed
bird
with
a
packet
of
squibs
tied
to
its
tail
great
is
the
consternation
and
deep
the
curses
that
issue
from
between
the
set
teeth
of
the
clodhoppers
who
now
give
up
the
harvest
for
lost
formerly
the
unskilful
mechanician
who
was
responsible
for
the
failure
would
have
been
clapped
into
gaol
but
nowadays
he
is
thought
sufficiently
punished
by
the
storm
of
public
indignation
and
the
loss
of
his
pay
the
disaster
is
announced
by
placards
posted
about
the
streets
in
the
evening
and
next
morning
the
newspapers
are
full
of
gloomy
prognostications
some
of
these
customs
have
been
transported
by
the
catholic
church
to
the
new
world
thus
in
mexico
the
new
fire
is
struck
from
a
flint
early
in
the
morning
of
easter
saturday
and
a
candle
which
has
been
lighted
at
the
sacred
flame
is
carried
through
the
church
by
a
deacon
shouting
meantime
the
whole
city
we
are
informed
has
been
converted
into
a
vast
place
of
execution
ropes
stretch
across
the
streets
from
house
to
house
and
from
every
house
dangles
an
effigy
of
judas
made
of
paper
pulp
scores
or
hundreds
of
them
may
adorn
a
single
street
they
are
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
grotesque
in
form
and
garbed
in
strange
attire
stuffed
with
gunpowder
squibs
and
crackers
sometimes
too
with
meat
bread
soap
candy
and
clothing
for
which
the
crowd
will
scramble
and
scuffle
while
the
effigies
are
burning
there
they
hang
grim
black
and
sullen
in
the
strong
sunshine
greeted
with
a
roar
of
execration
by
the
pious
mob
a
peal
of
bells
from
the
cathedral
tower
on
the
stroke
of
noon
gives
the
signal
for
the
execution
at
the
sound
a
frenzy
seizes
the
crowd
they
throw
themselves
furiously
on
the
figures
of
the
detested
traitor
cut
them
down
hurl
them
with
curses
into
the
fire
and
fight
and
struggle
with
each
other
in
their
efforts
to
tear
the
effigies
to
tatters
and
appropriate
their
contents
smoke
stink
sputter
of
crackers
oaths
curses
yells
are
now
the
order
of
the
day
but
the
traitor
does
not
perish
unavenged
for
the
anatomy
of
his
frame
has
been
cunningly
contrived
so
as
in
burning
to
discharge
volleys
of
squibs
into
his
assailants
and
the
wounds
and
burns
with
which
their
piety
is
rewarded
form
a
feature
of
the
morning
s
entertainment
the
english
jockey
club
in
mexico
used
to
improve
on
this
popular
pastime
by
suspending
huge
figures
of
judas
stuffed
with
copper
coins
from
ropes
in
front
of
their
clubhouse
these
were
ignited
at
the
proper
moment
and
lowered
within
reach
of
the
expectant
rabble
and
it
was
the
privilege
of
members
of
the
club
seated
in
the
balcony
to
watch
the
grimaces
and
to
hear
the
shrieks
of
the
victims
as
they
stamped
and
capered
about
with
the
hot
coppers
sticking
to
their
hands
divided
in
their
minds
between
an
acute
sense
of
pain
and
a
thirst
for
filthy
lucre
scenes
of
the
same
sort
though
on
a
less
ambitious
scale
are
witnessed
among
the
catholics
of
south
america
on
the
same
day
in
brazil
the
mourning
for
the
death
of
christ
ceases
at
noon
on
easter
saturday
and
gives
place
to
an
extravagant
burst
of
joy
at
his
resurrection
shots
are
fired
everywhere
and
effigies
of
judas
are
hung
on
trees
or
dragged
about
the
streets
to
be
finally
burned
or
otherwise
destroyed
in
the
indian
villages
scattered
among
the
wild
valleys
of
the
peruvian
andes
figures
of
the
traitor
made
of
pasteboard
and
stuffed
with
squibs
and
crackers
are
hanged
on
gibbets
before
the
door
of
the
church
on
easter
saturday
fire
is
set
to
them
and
while
they
crackle
and
explode
the
indians
dance
and
shout
for
joy
at
the
destruction
of
their
hated
enemy
similarly
at
rio
hacha
in
colombia
judas
is
represented
during
holy
week
by
effigies
and
the
people
fire
at
them
as
if
they
were
discharging
a
sacred
duty
but
usages
of
this
sort
are
not
confined
to
the
latin
church
they
are
common
to
the
greek
church
also
every
year
on
the
saturday
before
easter
sunday
a
new
fire
is
miraculously
kindled
at
the
holy
sepulchre
in
jerusalem
it
descends
from
heaven
and
ignites
the
candles
which
the
patriarch
holds
in
his
hands
while
with
closed
eyes
he
wrestles
in
prayer
all
alone
in
the
chapel
of
the
angel
the
worshippers
meanwhile
wait
anxiously
in
the
body
of
the
church
and
great
are
their
transports
of
joy
when
at
one
of
the
windows
of
the
chapel
which
had
been
all
dark
a
minute
before
there
suddenly
appears
the
hand
of
an
angel
or
of
the
patriarch
holding
a
lighted
taper
this
is
the
sacred
new
fire
it
is
passed
out
to
the
expectant
believers
and
the
desperate
struggle
which
ensues
among
them
to
get
a
share
of
its
blessed
influence
is
only
terminated
by
the
intervention
of
the
turkish
soldiery
who
restore
peace
and
order
by
hustling
the
whole
multitude
impartially
out
of
the
church
in
days
gone
by
many
lives
were
often
lost
in
these
holy
scrimmages
for
example
in
the
year
the
famous
ibrahim
pasha
witnessed
the
frantic
scene
from
one
of
the
galleries
and
being
moved
with
compassion
at
the
sight
descended
with
a
few
guards
into
the
arena
in
the
chimerical
hope
of
restoring
peace
and
order
among
the
contending
christians
he
contrived
to
force
his
way
into
the
midst
of
the
dense
crowd
but
there
the
heat
and
pressure
were
so
great
that
he
fainted
away
a
body
of
soldiers
seeing
his
danger
charged
straight
into
the
throng
and
carried
him
out
of
it
in
their
arms
trampling
under
foot
the
dying
and
dead
in
their
passage
nearly
two
hundred
people
were
killed
that
day
in
the
church
the
fortunate
survivors
on
these
occasions
who
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
portion
of
the
coveted
fire
applied
it
freely
to
their
faces
their
beards
and
their
garments
the
theory
was
that
the
fire
being
miraculous
could
only
bless
and
not
burn
them
but
the
practical
results
of
the
experiment
were
often
disappointing
for
while
the
blessings
were
more
or
less
dubious
there
could
be
no
doubt
whatever
about
the
burns
the
history
of
the
miracle
has
been
carefully
investigated
by
a
jesuit
father
the
conclusions
at
which
he
arrives
are
that
the
miracle
was
a
miracle
indeed
so
long
as
the
catholics
had
the
management
of
it
but
that
since
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
heretics
it
has
been
nothing
but
a
barefaced
trick
and
imposture
many
people
will
be
disposed
to
agree
with
the
latter
conclusion
who
might
hesitate
to
accept
the
former
at
athens
the
new
fire
is
kindled
in
the
cathedral
at
midnight
on
holy
saturday
a
dense
crowd
with
unlit
candles
in
their
hands
fills
the
square
in
front
of
the
cathedral
the
king
the
archbishop
and
the
highest
dignitaries
of
the
church
arrayed
in
their
gorgeous
robes
occupy
a
platform
and
at
the
exact
moment
of
the
resurrection
the
bells
ring
out
and
the
whole
square
bursts
as
by
magic
into
a
blaze
of
light
theoretically
all
the
candles
are
lit
from
the
sacred
new
fire
in
the
cathedral
but
practically
it
may
be
suspected
that
the
matches
which
bear
the
name
of
lucifer
have
some
share
in
the
sudden
illumination
effigies
of
judas
used
to
be
burned
at
athens
on
easter
saturday
but
the
custom
has
been
forbidden
by
the
government
however
firing
goes
on
more
or
less
continuously
all
over
the
city
both
on
easter
saturday
and
easter
sunday
and
the
cartridges
used
on
this
occasion
are
not
always
blank
the
shots
are
aimed
at
judas
but
sometimes
they
miss
him
and
hit
other
people
outside
of
athens
the
practice
of
burning
judas
in
effigy
still
survives
in
some
places
for
example
in
cos
a
straw
image
of
the
traitor
is
made
on
easter
day
and
after
being
hung
up
and
shot
at
it
is
burned
a
similar
custom
appears
to
prevail
at
thebes
it
used
to
be
observed
by
the
macedonian
peasantry
and
it
is
still
kept
up
at
therapia
a
fashionable
summer
resort
of
constantinople
in
the
armenian
church
the
sacred
new
fire
is
kindled
not
at
easter
but
at
candlemas
that
is
on
the
second
of
february
or
on
the
eve
of
that
festival
the
materials
of
the
bonfire
are
piled
in
an
open
space
near
a
church
and
they
are
generally
ignited
by
young
couples
who
have
been
married
within
the
year
however
it
is
the
bishop
or
his
vicar
who
lights
the
candles
with
which
fire
is
set
to
the
pile
all
young
married
pairs
are
expected
to
range
themselves
about
the
fire
and
to
dance
round
it
young
men
leap
over
the
flames
but
girls
and
women
content
themselves
with
going
round
them
while
they
pray
to
be
preserved
from
the
itch
and
other
when
the
ceremony
is
over
the
people
eagerly
pick
up
charred
sticks
or
ashes
of
the
fire
and
preserve
them
or
scatter
them
on
the
four
corners
of
the
roof
in
the
in
the
garden
and
on
the
pastures
for
these
holy
sticks
and
ashes
protect
men
and
cattle
against
disease
and
against
worms
and
caterpillars
omens
too
are
drawn
from
the
direction
in
which
the
wind
blows
the
flames
and
the
smoke
if
it
carries
them
eastward
there
is
hope
of
a
good
harvest
but
if
it
inclines
them
westward
the
people
fear
that
the
crops
will
fail
in
spite
of
the
thin
cloak
of
christianity
thrown
over
these
customs
by
representing
the
new
fire
as
an
emblem
of
christ
and
the
figure
burned
in
it
as
an
effigy
of
judas
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
both
practices
are
of
pagan
origin
neither
of
them
has
the
authority
of
christ
or
of
his
disciples
but
both
of
them
have
abundant
analogies
in
popular
custom
and
superstition
some
instances
of
the
practice
of
annually
extinguishing
fires
and
relighting
them
from
a
new
and
sacred
flame
have
already
come
before
us
but
a
few
examples
may
here
be
cited
for
the
sake
of
illustrating
the
wide
diffusion
of
a
custom
which
has
found
its
way
into
the
ritual
both
of
the
eastern
and
of
the
western
church
the
incas
of
peru
celebrated
a
festival
called
raymi
a
word
which
their
native
historian
garcilasso
de
la
vega
tells
us
was
equivalent
to
our
easter
it
was
held
in
honour
of
the
sun
at
the
solstice
in
june
for
three
days
before
the
festival
the
people
fasted
men
did
not
sleep
with
their
wives
and
no
fires
were
lighted
in
cuzco
the
capital
the
sacred
new
fire
was
obtained
direct
from
the
sun
by
concentrating
his
beams
on
a
highly
polished
concave
plate
and
reflecting
them
on
a
little
cotton
wool
with
this
holy
fire
the
sheep
and
lambs
offered
to
the
sun
were
consumed
and
the
flesh
of
such
as
were
to
be
eaten
at
the
festival
was
roasted
portions
of
the
new
fire
were
also
conveyed
to
the
temple
of
the
sun
and
to
the
convent
of
the
sacred
virgins
where
they
were
kept
burning
all
the
year
and
it
was
an
ill
omen
if
the
holy
flame
went
out
at
a
festival
held
in
the
last
month
of
the
old
mexican
year
all
the
fires
both
in
the
temples
and
in
the
houses
were
extinguished
and
the
priest
kindled
a
new
fire
by
rubbing
two
sticks
against
each
other
before
the
image
of
the
the
zuni
indians
of
new
mexico
kindle
a
new
fire
by
the
friction
of
wood
both
at
the
winter
and
the
summer
solstice
at
the
winter
solstice
the
chosen
collects
a
faggot
of
from
every
house
in
the
village
and
each
person
as
he
hands
the
wood
to
the
prays
that
the
crops
may
be
good
in
the
coming
year
for
several
days
before
the
new
fire
is
kindled
no
ashes
or
sweepings
may
be
removed
from
the
houses
and
no
artificial
light
may
appear
outside
of
them
not
even
a
burning
cigarette
or
the
flash
of
firearms
the
indians
believe
that
no
rain
will
fall
on
the
fields
of
the
man
outside
whose
house
a
light
has
been
seen
at
this
season
the
signal
for
kindling
the
new
fire
is
given
by
the
rising
of
the
morning
star
the
flame
is
produced
by
twirling
an
upright
stick
between
the
hands
on
a
horizontal
stick
laid
on
the
floor
of
a
sacred
chamber
the
sparks
being
caught
by
a
tinder
of
it
is
forbidden
to
blow
up
the
smouldering
tinder
with
the
breath
for
that
would
offend
the
gods
after
the
fire
has
thus
been
ceremonially
kindled
the
women
and
girls
of
all
the
families
in
the
village
clean
out
their
houses
they
carry
the
sweepings
and
ashes
in
baskets
or
bowls
to
the
fields
and
leave
them
there
to
the
sweepings
the
woman
says
i
now
deposit
you
as
sweepings
but
in
one
year
you
will
return
to
me
as
and
to
the
ashes
she
says
i
now
deposit
you
as
ashes
but
in
one
year
you
will
return
to
me
as
at
the
summer
solstice
the
sacred
fire
which
has
been
procured
by
the
friction
of
wood
is
used
to
kindle
the
grass
and
trees
that
there
may
be
a
great
cloud
of
smoke
while
are
swung
and
prayers
offered
that
the
up
aloft
will
water
the
earth
from
this
account
we
see
how
intimately
the
kindling
of
a
new
fire
at
the
two
of
the
sun
s
course
is
associated
in
the
minds
of
these
indians
with
the
fertility
of
the
land
particularly
with
the
growth
of
the
corn
the
rolling
smoke
is
apparently
an
imitation
of
designed
on
the
principle
of
homoeopathic
magic
to
draw
showers
from
the
blue
sky
once
a
year
the
iroquois
priesthood
supplied
the
people
with
a
new
fire
as
a
preparation
for
the
annual
rite
the
fires
in
all
the
huts
were
extinguished
and
the
ashes
scattered
about
then
the
priest
wearing
the
insignia
of
his
office
went
from
hut
to
hut
relighting
the
fires
by
means
of
a
flint
among
the
esquimaux
with
whom
hall
resided
it
was
the
custom
that
at
a
certain
time
which
answered
to
our
new
year
s
day
two
men
went
about
from
house
to
house
blowing
out
every
light
in
the
village
one
of
the
men
was
dressed
to
represent
a
woman
afterwards
the
lights
were
rekindled
from
a
fresh
fire
an
esquimau
woman
being
asked
what
all
this
meant
replied
new
among
the
esquimaux
of
iglulik
when
the
sun
first
rises
above
the
horizon
after
the
long
night
of
the
arctic
winter
the
children
who
have
watched
for
his
reappearance
run
into
the
houses
and
blow
out
the
lamps
then
they
receive
from
their
mothers
presents
of
pieces
of
wick
in
the
sudanese
kingdom
of
wadai
all
the
fires
in
the
villages
are
put
out
and
the
ashes
removed
from
the
houses
on
the
day
which
precedes
the
new
year
festival
at
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
a
new
fire
is
lit
by
the
friction
of
wood
in
the
great
straw
hut
where
the
village
elders
lounge
away
the
sultry
hours
together
and
every
man
takes
thence
a
burning
brand
with
which
he
rekindles
the
fire
on
his
domestic
hearth
in
the
province
of
the
egyptian
sudan
the
people
extinguish
their
old
fires
at
the
arab
new
year
and
bring
in
new
fire
on
the
same
occasion
they
beat
the
walls
of
their
huts
the
grass
thatches
and
the
walls
of
their
enclosures
in
order
to
drive
away
the
devil
or
evil
spirits
the
beating
of
the
walls
and
roofs
is
accompanied
by
the
firing
of
guns
the
shouting
of
men
and
the
shriller
cries
of
the
women
thus
these
people
combine
an
annual
expulsion
of
demons
with
an
annual
lighting
of
a
new
fire
among
the
swahili
of
east
africa
the
greatest
festival
is
that
of
the
new
year
which
falls
in
the
second
half
of
august
at
a
given
moment
all
the
fires
are
extinguished
with
water
and
afterwards
relit
by
the
friction
of
two
dry
pieces
of
wood
the
ashes
of
the
old
fires
are
carried
out
and
deposited
at
all
the
people
get
up
very
early
in
the
morning
and
bathe
in
the
sea
or
some
other
water
praying
to
be
kept
in
good
health
and
to
live
that
they
may
bathe
again
next
year
form
part
of
the
amusements
of
the
day
sometimes
they
pass
into
grim
reality
indeed
the
day
was
formerly
one
of
general
license
every
man
did
that
which
was
good
in
his
own
eyes
no
awkward
questions
were
asked
about
any
crimes
committed
on
this
occasion
so
some
people
improved
the
shining
hour
by
knocking
a
few
poor
devils
on
the
head
shooting
still
goes
on
during
the
whole
day
and
at
night
the
proceedings
generally
wind
up
with
a
great
dance
the
king
of
benametapa
as
the
early
portuguese
traders
called
him
in
east
africa
used
to
send
commissioners
annually
to
every
town
in
his
dominions
on
the
arrival
of
one
of
these
officers
the
inhabitants
of
each
town
had
to
put
out
all
their
fires
and
to
receive
a
new
fire
from
him
failure
to
comply
with
this
custom
was
treated
as
rebellion
some
tribes
of
british
central
africa
carefully
extinguish
the
fires
on
the
hearths
at
the
beginning
of
the
hoeing
season
and
at
harvest
the
fires
are
afterwards
rekindled
by
friction
and
the
people
indulge
in
dances
of
various
kinds
the
todas
of
the
neilgherry
hills
in
southern
india
annually
kindle
a
sacred
new
fire
by
the
friction
of
wood
in
the
month
which
begins
with
the
october
moon
the
ceremony
is
performed
by
two
holy
dairymen
at
the
foot
of
a
high
hill
when
they
have
lighted
the
fire
by
rubbing
two
dry
sticks
together
and
it
begins
to
burn
well
they
stand
a
little
way
off
and
pray
saying
may
the
young
grass
flower
may
honey
flourish
may
fruit
ripen
the
purpose
of
the
ceremony
is
to
make
the
grass
and
honey
plentiful
in
ancient
times
the
todas
lived
largely
on
wild
fruits
and
then
the
rite
of
the
new
fire
was
very
important
now
that
they
subsist
chiefly
on
the
milk
of
their
buffaloes
the
ceremony
has
lost
much
of
its
old
significance
when
the
nagas
of
india
have
felled
the
timber
and
cut
down
the
scrub
in
those
patches
of
jungle
which
they
propose
to
cultivate
they
put
out
all
the
fires
in
the
village
and
light
a
new
fire
by
rubbing
two
dry
pieces
of
wood
together
then
having
kindled
torches
at
it
they
proceed
with
them
to
the
jungle
and
ignite
the
felled
timber
and
brushwood
the
flesh
of
a
cow
or
buffalo
is
also
roasted
on
the
new
fire
and
furnishes
a
sacrificial
meal
near
the
small
town
of
kahma
in
burma
between
prome
and
thayetmyo
certain
gases
escape
from
a
hollow
in
the
ground
and
burn
with
a
steady
flame
during
the
dry
season
of
the
year
the
people
regard
the
flame
as
the
forge
of
a
spectral
smith
who
here
carried
on
his
business
after
death
had
removed
him
from
his
old
smithy
in
the
village
once
a
year
all
the
household
fires
in
kahma
are
extinguished
and
then
lighted
afresh
from
the
ghostly
flame
in
china
every
year
about
the
beginning
of
april
certain
officials
called
used
of
old
to
go
about
the
country
armed
with
wooden
clappers
their
business
was
to
summon
the
people
and
command
them
to
put
out
every
fire
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
season
called
or
eating
cold
for
three
days
all
household
fires
remained
extinct
as
a
preparation
for
the
solemn
renewal
of
the
fire
which
took
place
on
the
fifth
or
sixth
day
of
april
being
the
hundred
and
fifth
day
after
the
winter
solstice
the
ceremony
was
performed
with
great
pomp
by
the
same
officials
who
procured
the
new
fire
from
heaven
by
reflecting
the
sun
s
rays
either
from
a
metal
mirror
or
from
a
crystal
on
dry
moss
fire
thus
obtained
is
called
by
the
chinese
heavenly
fire
and
its
use
is
enjoined
in
sacrifices
whereas
fire
elicited
by
the
friction
of
wood
is
termed
by
them
earthly
fire
and
its
use
is
prescribed
for
cooking
and
other
domestic
purposes
when
once
the
new
fire
had
thus
been
drawn
from
the
sun
all
the
people
were
free
to
rekindle
their
domestic
hearths
and
as
a
chinese
distich
has
the
festival
of
the
cold
food
there
are
a
thousand
white
stalks
among
the
flowers
the
day
at
sunrise
you
may
see
the
smoke
of
ten
thousand
according
to
a
chinese
philosopher
the
reason
for
thus
renewing
fire
periodically
is
that
the
vital
principle
grows
weaker
and
weaker
in
old
fire
whereas
in
new
fire
it
is
young
and
vigorous
this
annual
renewal
of
fire
was
a
ceremony
of
very
great
antiquity
in
china
since
it
is
known
to
have
been
observed
in
the
time
of
the
first
dynasty
about
two
thousand
years
before
christ
under
the
tcheou
dynasty
a
change
in
the
calendar
led
to
shifting
the
from
spring
to
the
summer
solstice
but
afterwards
it
was
brought
back
to
its
original
date
although
the
custom
appears
to
have
long
fallen
into
disuse
the
barbarous
inhabitants
of
hainan
an
island
to
the
south
of
china
still
call
a
year
a
fire
as
if
in
memory
of
the
time
when
the
years
were
reckoned
by
the
annually
recurring
ceremony
of
rekindling
the
sacred
fire
a
japanese
book
written
two
centuries
ago
informs
us
that
sticks
resembling
the
wands
used
for
offerings
at
the
purification
ceremony
were
part
shaven
and
set
up
in
bundles
at
the
four
corners
of
the
gion
shrine
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
the
priests
after
prayers
were
recited
broke
up
the
bundles
and
set
fire
to
the
sticks
which
the
people
then
carried
home
to
light
their
household
fires
with
for
the
new
year
the
object
of
this
ceremony
was
to
avert
in
classical
antiquity
the
greek
island
of
lemnos
was
devoted
to
the
worship
of
the
hephaestus
who
was
said
to
have
fallen
on
it
when
zeus
hurled
him
from
heaven
once
a
year
every
fire
in
the
island
was
extinguished
and
remained
extinct
for
nine
days
during
which
sacrifices
were
offered
to
the
dead
and
to
the
infernal
powers
new
fire
was
brought
in
a
ship
from
the
sacred
isle
of
delos
and
with
it
the
fires
in
the
houses
and
the
workshops
were
relit
the
people
said
that
with
the
new
fire
they
made
a
new
beginning
of
life
if
the
ship
that
bore
the
sacred
flame
arrived
too
soon
it
might
not
put
in
to
shore
but
had
to
cruise
in
the
offing
till
the
nine
days
were
expired
at
rome
the
sacred
fire
in
the
temple
of
vesta
was
kindled
anew
every
year
on
the
first
of
march
which
used
to
be
the
beginning
of
the
roman
year
the
task
of
lighting
it
was
entrusted
to
the
vestal
virgins
and
they
performed
it
by
drilling
a
hole
in
a
board
of
lucky
wood
till
the
flame
was
elicited
by
friction
the
new
fire
thus
produced
was
carried
into
the
temple
of
vesta
by
one
of
the
virgins
in
a
bronze
sieve
among
the
celts
of
ireland
a
new
fire
was
annually
kindled
on
hallowe
en
or
the
eve
of
samhain
as
they
called
it
the
last
day
of
october
from
which
the
irish
new
year
began
and
all
the
hearths
throughout
the
country
are
said
to
have
been
relighted
from
the
fresh
fire
the
place
where
this
holy
flame
was
lit
bore
the
name
of
tlachtga
or
tlactga
it
has
been
identified
with
a
rath
or
native
fort
on
the
hill
of
ward
near
athboy
in
the
county
of
meath
it
was
there
says
the
old
irish
historian
geoffrey
keating
that
the
festival
of
the
fire
of
tlactga
was
ordered
to
be
held
and
it
was
thither
that
the
druids
of
ireland
were
wont
to
repair
and
to
assemble
in
solemn
meeting
on
the
eve
of
samhain
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
sacrifice
to
all
the
gods
it
was
in
that
fire
at
tlactga
that
their
sacrifice
was
burnt
and
it
was
made
obligatory
under
pain
of
punishment
to
extinguish
all
the
fires
of
ireland
on
that
eve
and
the
men
of
ireland
were
allowed
to
kindle
no
other
fire
but
that
one
and
for
each
of
the
other
fires
which
were
all
to
be
lighted
from
it
the
king
of
munster
was
to
receive
a
tax
of
a
that
is
of
three
pence
because
the
land
upon
which
tlactga
was
built
belongs
to
the
portion
of
meath
which
had
been
taken
from
in
the
villages
near
moscow
at
the
present
time
the
peasants
put
out
all
their
fires
on
the
eve
of
the
first
of
september
and
next
morning
at
sunrise
a
wise
man
or
a
wise
woman
rekindles
them
with
the
help
of
muttered
incantations
and
spells
instances
of
such
practices
might
doubtless
be
multiplied
but
the
foregoing
examples
may
suffice
to
render
it
probable
that
the
ecclesiastical
ceremony
of
lighting
a
sacred
new
fire
on
easter
saturday
had
originally
nothing
to
do
with
christianity
but
is
merely
one
case
of
a
custom
which
the
church
has
seen
fit
to
incorporate
in
its
ritual
it
might
be
supposed
that
in
the
western
church
the
custom
was
merely
a
survival
of
the
old
roman
usage
of
renewing
the
fire
on
the
first
of
march
were
it
not
that
the
observance
by
the
eastern
church
of
the
custom
on
the
same
day
seems
to
point
back
to
a
still
older
period
when
the
ceremony
of
lighting
a
new
fire
in
spring
perhaps
at
the
vernal
equinox
was
common
to
many
peoples
of
the
mediterranean
area
we
may
conjecture
that
wherever
such
a
ceremony
has
been
observed
it
originally
marked
the
beginning
of
a
new
year
as
it
did
in
ancient
rome
and
ireland
and
as
it
still
does
in
the
sudanese
kingdom
of
wadai
and
among
the
swahili
of
eastern
africa
the
essentially
pagan
character
of
the
easter
fire
festival
appears
plainly
both
from
the
mode
in
which
it
is
celebrated
by
the
peasants
and
from
the
superstitious
beliefs
which
they
associate
with
it
all
over
northern
and
central
germany
from
altmark
and
anhalt
on
the
east
through
brunswick
hanover
oldenburg
the
harz
district
and
hesse
to
westphalia
the
easter
bonfires
still
blaze
simultaneously
on
the
as
many
as
forty
may
sometimes
be
counted
within
sight
at
once
long
before
easter
the
young
people
have
been
busy
collecting
firewood
every
farmer
contributes
and
petroleum
cases
and
so
forth
go
to
swell
the
pile
neighbouring
villages
vie
with
each
other
as
to
which
shall
send
up
the
greatest
blaze
the
fires
are
always
kindled
year
after
year
on
the
same
hill
which
accordingly
often
takes
the
name
of
easter
mountain
it
is
a
fine
spectacle
to
watch
from
some
eminence
the
bonfires
flaring
up
one
after
another
on
the
neighbouring
heights
as
far
as
their
light
reaches
so
far
in
the
belief
of
the
peasants
the
fields
will
be
fruitful
and
the
houses
on
which
they
shine
will
be
safe
from
conflagration
or
sickness
at
volkmarsen
and
other
places
in
hesse
the
people
used
to
observe
which
way
the
wind
blew
the
flames
and
then
they
sowed
flax
seed
in
that
direction
confident
that
it
would
grow
well
brands
taken
from
the
bonfires
preserve
houses
from
being
struck
by
lightning
and
the
ashes
increase
the
fertility
of
the
fields
protect
them
from
mice
and
mixed
with
the
of
cattle
make
the
animals
thrive
and
ensure
them
against
plague
as
the
flames
die
down
young
and
old
leap
over
them
and
cattle
are
sometimes
driven
through
the
smouldering
embers
in
some
places
or
wheels
wrapt
in
straw
used
to
be
set
on
fire
and
then
sent
rolling
down
the
hillside
in
others
the
boys
light
torches
and
wisps
of
straw
at
the
bonfires
and
rush
about
brandishing
them
in
their
hands
where
the
people
are
divided
between
protestantism
and
catholicism
as
in
hildesheim
it
has
been
observed
that
among
protestants
the
easter
bonfires
are
generally
left
to
the
boys
while
in
catholic
districts
they
are
cared
for
by
persons
and
here
the
whole
population
will
gather
round
the
blazing
pile
and
join
in
singing
choral
hymns
which
echo
far
and
wide
in
the
stillness
of
night
in
münsterland
these
easter
fires
are
always
kindled
upon
certain
definite
hills
which
are
hence
known
as
easter
or
paschal
mountains
the
whole
community
assembles
about
the
fire
fathers
of
families
form
an
inner
circle
round
it
an
outer
circle
is
composed
of
the
young
men
and
maidens
who
singing
easter
hymns
march
round
and
round
the
fire
in
the
direction
of
the
sun
till
the
blaze
dies
down
then
the
girls
jump
over
the
fire
in
a
line
one
after
the
other
each
supported
by
two
young
men
who
hold
her
hands
and
run
beside
her
when
the
fire
has
burned
out
the
whole
assembly
marches
in
solemn
procession
to
the
church
singing
hymns
they
go
thrice
round
the
church
and
then
break
up
in
the
twilight
boys
with
blazing
bundles
of
straw
run
over
the
fields
to
make
them
fruitful
at
delmenhorst
in
oldenburg
it
used
to
be
the
custom
to
cut
down
two
trees
plant
them
in
the
ground
side
by
side
and
pile
twelve
one
above
the
other
against
each
of
the
trees
brushwood
was
then
heaped
about
the
trees
and
on
the
evening
of
easter
saturday
the
boys
after
rushing
about
with
blazing
in
their
hands
set
fire
to
the
whole
at
the
end
of
the
ceremony
the
urchins
tried
to
blacken
each
other
and
the
clothes
of
people
in
schaumburg
the
easter
bonfires
may
be
seen
blazing
on
all
the
mountains
around
for
miles
they
are
made
with
a
fastened
to
a
which
is
wrapt
in
straw
the
people
dance
singing
round
them
in
the
harz
mountains
the
fire
is
commonly
made
by
piling
brushwood
about
a
tree
and
setting
it
on
fire
at
osterode
every
one
tries
to
snatch
a
brand
from
the
bonfire
and
runs
about
with
it
the
better
it
burns
the
more
lucky
it
is
in
grund
there
are
in
the
altmark
the
easter
bonfires
are
composed
of
and
so
forth
piled
round
a
pole
the
young
folk
dance
round
the
fire
and
when
it
has
died
out
the
old
folk
come
and
collect
the
ashes
which
they
preserve
as
a
remedy
for
the
ailments
of
bees
it
is
also
believed
that
as
far
as
the
blaze
of
the
bonfire
is
visible
the
corn
will
grow
well
throughout
the
year
and
no
conflagration
will
break
out
at
braunröde
in
the
harz
mountains
it
was
the
custom
to
burn
squirrels
in
the
easter
bonfire
in
the
altmark
bones
were
burned
in
it
further
south
the
easter
fires
are
or
used
to
be
lit
in
many
districts
of
bavaria
thus
on
easter
monday
in
some
parts
of
middle
franken
the
schoolboys
collect
all
the
old
besoms
they
can
lay
hands
on
and
march
with
them
in
a
long
procession
to
a
neighbouring
height
when
the
first
chime
of
the
evening
bell
comes
up
from
the
dale
they
set
fire
to
the
brooms
and
run
along
the
ridges
waving
them
so
that
seen
from
below
the
hills
appear
to
be
crested
with
a
twinkling
and
moving
chain
of
fire
in
some
parts
of
upper
bavaria
at
easter
burning
arrows
or
discs
of
wood
were
shot
from
high
into
the
air
as
in
the
swabian
and
swiss
customs
already
described
at
oberau
instead
of
the
discs
an
old
was
sometimes
wrapt
in
straw
ignited
and
sent
rolling
and
blazing
down
the
mountain
the
lads
who
hurled
the
discs
received
painted
easter
eggs
from
the
girls
near
forchheim
in
upper
franken
a
called
the
judas
used
to
be
burned
in
the
churchyards
on
easter
saturday
the
whole
village
contributed
wood
to
the
pyre
on
which
he
perished
and
the
charred
sticks
were
afterwards
kept
and
planted
in
the
fields
on
walpurgis
day
the
first
of
may
to
preserve
the
wheat
from
blight
and
mildew
about
a
hundred
years
ago
or
more
the
custom
at
althenneberg
in
upper
bavaria
used
to
be
as
follows
on
the
afternoon
of
easter
saturday
the
lads
collected
wood
which
they
piled
in
a
cornfield
while
in
the
middle
of
the
pile
they
set
up
a
tall
wooden
cross
all
swathed
in
straw
after
the
evening
service
they
lighted
their
lanterns
at
the
consecrated
candle
in
the
church
and
ran
with
them
at
full
speed
to
the
pyre
each
striving
to
get
there
first
the
first
to
arrive
set
fire
to
the
heap
no
woman
or
girl
might
come
near
the
bonfire
but
they
were
allowed
to
watch
it
from
a
distance
as
the
flames
rose
the
men
and
lads
rejoiced
and
made
merry
shouting
we
are
burning
the
judas
two
of
them
had
to
watch
the
glowing
embers
the
whole
night
long
lest
people
should
come
and
steal
them
next
morning
at
sunrise
they
carefully
collected
the
ashes
and
threw
them
into
the
running
water
of
the
röten
brook
the
man
who
had
been
the
first
to
reach
the
pyre
and
to
kindle
it
was
rewarded
on
easter
sunday
by
the
women
who
gave
him
coloured
eggs
at
the
church
door
women
gave
him
two
poorer
women
gave
him
only
one
the
object
of
the
whole
ceremony
was
to
keep
off
the
hail
about
a
century
ago
the
judas
fire
as
it
was
called
was
put
down
by
the
police
at
giggenhausen
and
aufkirchen
two
other
villages
of
upper
bavaria
a
similar
custom
prevailed
yet
with
some
interesting
differences
here
the
ceremony
which
took
place
between
nine
and
ten
at
night
on
easter
saturday
was
called
burning
the
easter
on
a
height
about
a
mile
from
the
village
the
young
fellows
set
up
a
tall
cross
enveloped
in
straw
so
that
it
looked
like
a
man
with
his
arms
stretched
out
this
was
the
easter
man
no
lad
under
eighteen
years
of
age
might
take
part
in
the
ceremony
one
of
the
young
men
stationed
himself
beside
the
easter
man
holding
in
his
hand
a
consecrated
taper
which
he
had
brought
from
the
church
and
lighted
the
rest
stood
at
equal
intervals
in
a
great
circle
round
the
cross
at
a
given
signal
they
raced
thrice
round
the
circle
and
then
at
a
second
signal
ran
straight
at
the
cross
and
at
the
lad
with
the
lighted
taper
beside
it
the
one
who
reached
the
goal
first
had
the
right
of
setting
fire
to
the
easter
man
great
was
the
jubilation
while
he
was
burning
when
he
had
been
consumed
in
the
flames
three
lads
were
chosen
from
among
the
rest
and
each
of
the
three
drew
a
circle
on
the
ground
with
a
stick
thrice
round
the
ashes
then
they
all
left
the
spot
on
easter
monday
the
villagers
gathered
the
ashes
and
strewed
them
on
their
fields
also
they
planted
in
the
fields
which
had
been
consecrated
on
palm
sunday
and
sticks
which
had
been
charred
and
hallowed
on
good
friday
all
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
their
fields
against
showers
of
hail
the
custom
of
burning
an
easter
man
made
of
straw
on
easter
saturday
was
observed
also
at
abensberg
in
lower
bavaria
in
some
parts
of
swabia
the
easter
fires
might
not
be
kindled
with
iron
or
steel
or
flint
but
only
by
the
friction
of
wood
in
baden
bonfires
are
still
kindled
in
the
churchyards
on
easter
saturday
and
ecclesiastical
refuse
of
various
sorts
such
as
old
surplices
and
the
wool
used
by
the
priest
in
the
application
of
extreme
unction
is
consumed
in
the
flames
at
zoznegg
down
to
about
the
fire
was
lighted
by
the
priest
by
means
of
a
flint
which
had
never
been
used
before
people
bring
sticks
especially
oaken
sticks
char
them
in
the
fire
and
then
carry
them
home
and
keep
them
in
the
house
as
a
preservative
against
lightning
at
zoznegg
these
oaken
sticks
were
each
about
an
ell
and
a
half
long
and
they
went
by
the
name
of
weather
or
thunder
poles
when
a
threatened
to
break
out
one
of
the
sticks
was
put
into
a
small
fire
in
order
that
the
hallowed
smoke
ascending
to
the
clouds
might
ward
off
the
lightning
from
the
house
and
the
hail
from
the
fields
and
gardens
at
schöllbronn
the
oaken
sticks
which
are
thus
charred
in
the
easter
bonfire
and
kept
in
the
house
as
a
protective
against
thunder
and
lightning
are
three
in
number
perhaps
with
an
allusion
to
the
trinity
they
are
brought
every
easter
to
be
consecrated
afresh
in
the
bonfire
till
they
are
quite
burnt
away
in
the
lake
district
of
baden
it
is
also
customary
to
burn
one
of
these
holy
sticks
in
the
fire
when
a
heavy
thunderstorm
is
raging
hence
it
seems
that
the
ancient
association
of
the
oak
with
the
thunder
persists
in
the
minds
of
german
peasants
to
the
present
day
thus
the
custom
of
the
easter
fires
appears
to
have
prevailed
all
over
central
and
western
germany
from
north
to
south
we
find
it
also
in
holland
where
the
fires
were
kindled
on
the
highest
eminences
and
the
people
danced
round
them
and
leaped
through
the
flames
or
over
the
glowing
embers
here
too
as
so
often
in
germany
the
materials
for
the
bonfire
were
collected
by
the
young
folk
from
door
to
door
in
many
parts
of
sweden
firearms
are
as
at
athens
discharged
in
all
directions
on
easter
eve
and
huge
bonfires
are
lighted
on
hills
and
eminences
some
people
think
that
the
intention
is
to
keep
off
the
troll
and
other
evil
spirits
who
are
especially
active
at
this
season
when
the
afternoon
service
on
good
friday
is
over
german
children
in
bohemia
drive
judas
out
of
the
church
by
running
about
the
sacred
edifice
and
even
the
streets
shaking
rattles
and
clappers
next
day
on
easter
saturday
the
remains
of
the
holy
oil
are
burnt
before
the
church
door
in
a
fire
which
must
be
kindled
with
flint
and
steel
this
fire
is
called
the
burning
of
judas
but
in
spite
of
its
evil
name
a
beneficent
virtue
is
ascribed
to
it
for
the
people
scuffle
for
the
cinders
which
they
put
in
the
roofs
of
their
houses
as
a
safeguard
against
fire
and
lightning
the
beltane
fires
in
the
central
highlands
of
scotland
bonfires
known
as
the
beltane
fires
were
formerly
kindled
with
great
ceremony
on
the
first
of
may
and
the
traces
of
human
sacrifices
at
them
were
particularly
clear
and
unequivocal
the
custom
of
lighting
the
bonfires
lasted
in
various
places
far
into
the
eighteenth
century
and
the
descriptions
of
the
ceremony
by
writers
of
that
period
present
such
a
curious
and
interesting
picture
of
ancient
heathendom
surviving
in
our
own
country
that
i
will
reproduce
them
in
the
words
of
their
authors
the
fullest
of
the
descriptions
so
far
as
i
know
is
the
one
bequeathed
to
us
by
john
ramsay
laird
of
ochtertyre
near
crieff
the
patron
of
burns
and
the
friend
of
sir
walter
scott
from
his
voluminous
manuscripts
written
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
eighteenth
century
a
selection
was
published
in
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
following
account
of
beltane
is
extracted
from
a
chapter
dealing
with
highland
superstitions
ramsay
says
but
the
most
considerable
of
the
druidical
festivals
is
that
of
beltane
or
which
was
lately
observed
in
some
parts
of
the
highlands
with
extraordinary
ceremonies
of
later
years
it
is
chiefly
attended
to
by
young
people
persons
advanced
in
years
considering
it
as
inconsistent
with
their
gravity
to
give
it
any
countenance
yet
a
number
of
circumstances
relative
to
it
may
be
collected
from
tradition
or
the
conversation
of
very
old
people
who
witnessed
this
feast
in
their
youth
when
the
ancient
rites
were
better
observed
this
festival
is
called
in
gaelic
the
fire
of
bel
like
the
other
public
worship
of
the
druids
the
beltane
feast
seems
to
have
been
performed
on
hills
or
eminences
they
thought
it
degrading
to
him
whose
temple
is
the
universe
to
suppose
that
he
would
dwell
in
any
house
made
with
hands
their
sacrifices
were
therefore
offered
in
the
open
air
frequently
upon
the
tops
of
hills
where
they
were
presented
with
the
grandest
views
of
nature
and
were
nearest
the
seat
of
warmth
and
order
and
according
to
tradition
such
was
the
manner
of
celebrating
this
festival
in
the
highlands
within
the
last
hundred
years
but
since
the
decline
of
superstition
it
has
been
celebrated
by
the
people
of
each
hamlet
on
some
hill
or
rising
ground
around
which
their
cattle
were
pasturing
thither
the
young
folks
repaired
in
the
morning
and
cut
a
trench
on
the
summit
of
which
a
seat
of
turf
was
formed
for
the
company
and
in
the
middle
a
pile
of
wood
or
other
fuel
was
placed
which
of
old
they
kindled
with
or
although
for
many
years
past
they
have
been
contented
with
common
fire
yet
we
shall
now
describe
the
process
because
it
will
hereafter
appear
that
recourse
is
still
had
to
the
upon
extraordinary
emergencies
the
night
before
all
the
fires
in
the
country
were
carefully
extinguished
and
next
morning
the
materials
for
exciting
this
sacred
fire
were
prepared
the
most
primitive
method
seems
to
be
that
which
was
used
in
the
islands
of
skye
mull
and
tiree
a
plank
of
oak
was
procured
in
the
midst
of
which
a
hole
was
bored
a
wimble
of
the
same
timber
was
then
applied
the
end
of
which
they
fitted
to
the
hole
but
in
some
parts
of
the
mainland
the
machinery
was
different
they
used
a
frame
of
green
wood
of
a
square
form
in
the
centre
of
which
was
an
in
some
places
three
times
three
persons
in
others
three
times
nine
were
required
for
turning
round
by
turns
the
or
wimble
if
any
of
them
had
been
guilty
of
murder
adultery
theft
or
other
atrocious
crime
it
was
imagined
either
that
the
fire
would
not
kindle
or
that
it
would
be
devoid
of
its
usual
virtue
so
soon
as
any
sparks
were
emitted
by
means
of
the
violent
friction
they
applied
a
species
of
agaric
which
grows
on
old
and
is
very
combustible
this
fire
had
the
appearance
of
being
immediately
derived
from
heaven
and
manifold
were
the
virtues
ascribed
to
it
they
esteemed
it
a
preservative
against
witchcraft
and
a
sovereign
remedy
against
malignant
diseases
both
in
the
human
species
and
in
cattle
and
by
it
the
strongest
poisons
were
supposed
to
have
their
nature
changed
after
kindling
the
bonfire
with
the
the
company
prepared
their
victuals
and
as
soon
as
they
had
finished
their
meal
they
amused
themselves
a
while
in
singing
and
dancing
round
the
fire
towards
the
close
of
the
entertainment
the
person
who
officiated
as
master
of
the
feast
produced
a
large
cake
baked
with
eggs
and
scalloped
round
the
edge
called
bonnach
the
beltane
cake
it
was
divided
into
a
number
of
pieces
and
distributed
in
great
form
to
the
company
there
was
one
particular
piece
which
whoever
got
was
called
the
beltane
a
term
of
great
reproach
upon
his
being
known
part
of
the
company
laid
hold
of
him
and
made
a
show
of
putting
him
into
the
fire
but
the
majority
interposing
he
was
rescued
and
in
some
places
they
laid
him
flat
on
the
ground
making
as
if
they
would
quarter
him
afterwards
he
was
pelted
with
and
retained
the
odious
appellation
during
the
whole
year
and
while
the
feast
was
fresh
in
people
s
memory
they
affected
to
speak
of
the
as
dead
this
festival
was
longest
observed
in
the
interior
highlands
for
towards
the
west
coast
the
traces
of
it
are
faintest
in
glenorchy
and
lorne
a
large
cake
is
made
on
that
day
which
they
consume
in
the
house
and
in
mull
it
has
a
large
hole
in
the
middle
through
which
each
of
the
cows
in
the
fold
is
milked
in
tiree
it
is
of
a
triangular
form
the
more
elderly
people
remember
when
this
festival
was
celebrated
with
some
solemnity
in
both
these
islands
there
are
at
present
no
vestiges
of
it
in
skye
or
the
long
island
the
inhabitants
of
which
have
substituted
the
or
michael
s
cake
it
is
made
at
michaelmas
with
milk
and
oatmeal
and
some
eggs
are
sprinkled
on
its
surface
part
of
it
is
sent
to
the
neighbours
it
is
probable
that
at
the
original
beltane
festival
there
were
two
fires
kindled
near
one
another
when
any
person
is
in
a
critical
dilemma
pressed
on
each
side
by
unsurmountable
difficulties
the
highlanders
have
a
proverb
e
eada
anda
theine
he
is
between
the
two
beltane
fires
there
are
in
several
parts
small
round
hills
which
it
is
like
owe
their
present
names
to
such
solemn
uses
one
of
the
highest
and
most
central
in
icolmkil
is
called
the
hill
of
the
fires
there
is
another
of
the
same
name
near
the
kirk
of
balquhidder
and
at
killin
there
is
a
round
green
eminence
which
seems
to
have
been
raised
by
art
it
is
called
the
eminence
of
the
fires
around
it
there
are
the
remains
of
a
circular
wall
about
two
feet
high
on
the
top
a
stone
stands
upon
end
according
to
the
tradition
of
the
inhabitants
it
was
a
place
of
druidical
worship
and
it
was
afterwards
pitched
on
as
the
most
venerable
spot
for
holding
courts
of
justice
for
the
country
of
breadalbane
the
earth
of
this
eminence
is
still
thought
to
be
possessed
of
some
healing
virtue
for
when
cattle
are
observed
to
be
diseased
some
of
it
is
sent
for
which
is
rubbed
on
the
part
in
the
parish
of
callander
a
beautiful
district
of
western
perthshire
the
beltane
custom
was
still
in
vogue
towards
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
has
been
described
as
follows
by
the
parish
minister
of
the
time
upon
the
first
day
of
may
which
is
called
or
day
all
the
boys
in
a
township
or
hamlet
meet
in
the
moors
they
cut
a
table
in
the
green
sod
of
a
round
figure
by
casting
a
trench
in
the
ground
of
such
circumference
as
to
hold
the
whole
company
they
kindle
a
fire
and
dress
a
repast
of
eggs
and
milk
in
the
consistence
of
a
custard
they
knead
a
cake
of
oatmeal
which
is
toasted
at
the
embers
against
a
stone
after
the
custard
is
eaten
up
they
divide
the
cake
into
so
many
portions
as
similar
as
possible
to
one
another
in
size
and
shape
as
there
are
persons
in
the
company
they
daub
one
of
these
portions
all
over
with
charcoal
until
it
be
perfectly
black
they
put
all
the
bits
of
the
cake
into
a
bonnet
every
one
blindfold
draws
out
a
portion
he
who
holds
the
bonnet
is
entitled
to
the
last
bit
whoever
draws
the
black
bit
is
the
person
who
is
to
be
sacrificed
to
whose
favour
they
mean
to
implore
in
rendering
the
year
productive
of
the
sustenance
of
man
and
beast
there
is
little
doubt
of
these
inhuman
sacrifices
having
been
once
offered
in
this
country
as
well
as
in
the
east
although
they
now
pass
from
the
act
of
sacrificing
and
only
compel
the
person
to
leap
three
times
through
the
flames
with
which
the
ceremonies
of
this
festival
are
thomas
pennant
who
travelled
in
perthshire
in
the
year
tells
us
that
on
the
first
of
may
the
herdsmen
of
every
village
hold
their
a
rural
sacrifice
they
cut
a
square
trench
on
the
ground
leaving
the
turf
in
the
middle
on
that
they
make
a
fire
of
wood
on
which
they
dress
a
large
caudle
of
eggs
butter
oatmeal
and
milk
and
bring
besides
the
ingredients
of
the
caudle
plenty
of
beer
and
whisky
for
each
of
the
company
must
contribute
something
the
rites
begin
with
spilling
some
of
the
caudle
on
the
ground
by
way
of
libation
on
that
every
one
takes
a
cake
of
oatmeal
upon
which
are
raised
nine
square
knobs
each
dedicated
to
some
particular
being
the
supposed
preserver
of
their
flocks
and
herds
or
to
some
particular
animal
the
real
destroyer
of
them
each
person
then
turns
his
face
to
the
fire
breaks
off
a
knob
and
flinging
it
over
his
shoulders
says
this
i
give
to
thee
preserve
thou
my
horses
this
to
thee
preserve
thou
my
sheep
and
so
after
that
they
use
the
same
ceremony

another
writer
of
the
eighteenth
century
has
described
the
beltane
festival
as
it
was
held
in
the
parish
of
logierait
in
perthshire
he
says
on
the
first
of
may
a
festival
called
is
annually
held
here
it
is
chiefly
celebrated
by
the
who
assemble
by
scores
in
the
fields
to
dress
a
dinner
for
themselves
of
boiled
milk
and
eggs
these
dishes
they
eat
with
a
sort
of
cakes
baked
for
the
occasion
and
having
small
lumps
in
the
form
of
raised
all
over
the
in
this
last
account
no
mention
is
made
of
bonfires
but
they
were
probably
lighted
for
a
contemporary
writer
informs
us
that
in
the
parish
of
kirkmichael
which
adjoins
the
parish
of
logierait
on
the
east
the
custom
of
lighting
a
fire
in
the
fields
and
baking
a
consecrated
cake
on
the
first
of
may
was
not
quite
obsolete
in
his
time
we
may
conjecture
that
the
cake
with
knobs
was
formerly
used
for
the
purpose
of
determining
who
should
be
the
beltane
carline
or
victim
doomed
to
the
flames
a
trace
of
this
custom
survived
perhaps
in
the
custom
of
baking
oatmeal
cakes
of
a
special
kind
and
rolling
them
down
hill
about
noon
on
the
first
of
may
for
it
was
thought
that
the
person
whose
cake
broke
as
it
rolled
would
die
or
be
unfortunate
within
the
year
these
cakes
or
bannocks
as
we
call
them
in
scotland
were
baked
in
the
usual
way
but
they
were
washed
over
with
a
thin
batter
composed
of
whipped
egg
milk
or
cream
and
a
little
oatmeal
this
custom
appears
to
have
prevailed
at
or
near
kingussie
in
at
achterneed
near
strathpeffer
in
the
beltane
bannocks
were
called
or
because
they
were
kneaded
entirely
in
the
hand
and
not
on
a
board
or
table
like
common
cakes
and
after
being
baked
they
might
not
be
placed
anywhere
but
in
the
hands
of
the
children
who
were
to
eat
them
in
the
of
scotland
the
beltane
fires
were
still
kindled
in
the
latter
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
herdsmen
of
several
farms
used
to
gather
dry
wood
kindle
it
and
dance
three
times
southways
about
the
burning
pile
but
in
this
region
according
to
a
later
authority
the
beltane
fires
were
lit
not
on
the
first
but
on
the
second
of
may
old
style
they
were
called
the
people
believed
that
on
that
evening
and
night
the
witches
were
abroad
and
busy
casting
spells
on
cattle
and
stealing
cows
milk
to
counteract
their
machinations
pieces
of
and
woodbine
but
especially
of
were
placed
over
the
doors
of
the
and
fires
were
kindled
by
every
farmer
and
cottar
old
thatch
straw
furze
or
broom
was
piled
in
a
heap
and
set
on
fire
a
little
after
sunset
while
some
of
the
bystanders
kept
tossing
the
blazing
mass
others
hoisted
portions
of
it
on
pitchforks
or
poles
and
ran
hither
and
thither
holding
them
as
high
as
they
could
meantime
the
young
people
danced
round
the
fire
or
ran
through
the
smoke
shouting
fire
blaze
and
burn
the
witches
fire
fire
burn
the
in
some
districts
a
large
round
cake
of
oat
or
barley
meal
was
rolled
through
the
ashes
when
all
the
fuel
was
consumed
the
people
scattered
the
ashes
far
and
wide
and
till
the
night
grew
quite
dark
they
continued
to
run
through
them
crying
fire
burn
the
in
the
hebrides
the
beltane
bannock
is
smaller
than
that
made
at
michael
s
but
is
made
in
the
same
way
it
is
no
longer
made
in
uist
but
father
allan
remembers
seeing
his
grandmother
make
one
about
years
ago
there
was
also
a
cheese
made
generally
on
the
first
of
may
which
was
kept
to
the
next
beltane
as
a
sort
of
charm
against
the
bewitching
of
the
beltane
customs
seem
to
have
been
the
same
as
elsewhere
every
fire
was
put
out
and
a
large
one
lit
on
the
top
of
the
hill
and
the
cattle
driven
round
it
sunwards
to
keep
off
murrain
all
the
year
each
man
would
take
home
fire
wherewith
to
kindle
his
in
wales
also
the
custom
of
lighting
beltane
fires
at
the
beginning
of
may
used
to
be
observed
but
the
day
on
which
they
were
kindled
varied
from
the
eve
of
may
day
to
the
third
of
may
the
flame
was
sometimes
elicited
by
the
friction
of
two
pieces
of
oak
as
appears
from
the
following
description
the
fire
was
done
in
this
way
nine
men
would
turn
their
pockets
inside
out
and
see
that
every
piece
of
money
and
all
metals
were
off
their
persons
then
the
men
went
into
the
nearest
woods
and
collected
sticks
of
nine
different
kinds
of
trees
these
were
carried
to
the
spot
where
the
fire
had
to
be
built
there
a
circle
was
cut
in
the
sod
and
the
sticks
were
set
crosswise
all
around
the
circle
the
people
stood
and
watched
the
proceedings
one
of
the
men
would
then
take
two
bits
of
oak
and
rub
them
together
until
a
flame
was
kindled
this
was
applied
to
the
sticks
and
soon
a
large
fire
was
made
sometimes
two
fires
were
set
up
side
by
side
these
fires
whether
one
or
two
were
called
or
bonfire
round
cakes
of
oatmeal
and
brown
meal
were
split
in
four
and
placed
in
a
small
and
everybody
present
had
to
pick
out
a
portion
the
last
bit
in
the
bag
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
each
person
who
chanced
to
pick
up
a
piece
of
cake
was
compelled
to
leap
three
times
over
the
flames
or
to
run
thrice
between
the
two
fires
by
which
means
the
people
thought
they
were
sure
of
a
plentiful
harvest
shouts
and
screams
of
those
who
had
to
face
the
ordeal
could
be
heard
ever
so
far
and
those
who
chanced
to
pick
the
oatmeal
portions
sang
and
danced
and
clapped
their
hands
in
approval
as
the
holders
of
the
brown
bits
leaped
three
times
over
the
flames
or
ran
three
times
between
the
two
fires
as
a
rule
no
danger
attended
these
curious
celebrations
but
occasionally
somebody
s
clothes
caught
fire
which
was
quickly
put
out
the
greatest
fire
of
the
year
was
the
eve
of
may
or
may
first
second
or
third
the
midsummer
eve
fire
was
more
for
the
harvest
very
often
a
fire
was
built
on
the
eve
of
november
the
high
ground
near
the
castle
ditches
at
llantwit
major
in
the
vale
of
glamorgan
was
a
familiar
spot
for
the
beltane
on
may
third
and
on
midsummer
eve
sometimes
the
beltane
fire
was
lighted
by
the
flames
produced
by
stone
instead
of
wood
friction
charred
logs
and
faggots
used
in
the
may
beltane
were
carefully
preserved
and
from
them
the
next
fire
was
lighted
may
fires
were
always
started
with
old
faggots
of
the
previous
year
and
midsummer
from
those
of
the
last
summer
it
was
unlucky
to
build
a
midsummer
fire
from
may
faggots
people
carried
the
ashes
left
after
these
fires
to
their
homes
and
a
charred
brand
was
not
only
effectual
against
pestilence
but
magical
in
its
use
a
few
of
the
ashes
placed
in
a
person
s
shoes
protected
the
wearer
from
any
great
sorrow
or
from
the
foregoing
account
we
learn
that
bonfires
were
kindled
in
wales
on
midsummer
eve
and
hallowe
en
the
of
october
as
well
as
at
the
beginning
of
may
but
that
the
beltane
fires
in
may
were
deemed
the
most
important
to
the
midsummer
eve
and
hallowe
en
fires
we
shall
return
presently
the
belief
of
the
people
that
by
leaping
thrice
over
the
bonfires
or
running
thrice
between
them
they
ensured
a
plentiful
harvest
is
worthy
of
note
the
mode
in
which
this
result
was
supposed
to
be
brought
about
is
indicated
by
another
writer
on
welsh
according
to
whom
it
used
to
be
held
that
the
bonfires
lighted
in
may
or
midsummer
protected
the
lands
from
sorcery
so
that
good
crops
would
follow
the
ashes
were
also
considered
valuable
as
hence
it
appears
that
the
heat
of
the
fires
was
thought
to
fertilize
the
fields
not
directly
by
quickening
the
seeds
in
the
ground
but
indirectly
by
counteracting
the
baleful
influence
of
witchcraft
or
perhaps
by
burning
up
the
persons
of
the
witches
the
druidical
anniversary
of
beil
or
baal
is
still
celebrated
in
the
isle
of
man
on
the
first
of
may
the
baal
fires
were
as
usual
on
that
day
so
numerous
as
to
give
the
island
the
appearance
of
a
general
by
may
day
in
manx
is
meant
may
day
old
style
or
laa
as
it
is
called
in
manx
the
day
was
one
on
which
the
power
of
elves
and
witches
was
particularly
dreaded
and
the
people
resorted
to
many
precautions
in
order
to
protect
themselves
against
these
mischievous
beings
hence
at
daybreak
they
set
fire
to
the
ling
or
gorse
for
the
purpose
of
burning
out
the
witches
who
are
wont
to
lurk
in
the
form
of
hares
on
the
hemlock
stone
a
natural
pillar
of
sandstone
standing
on
stapleford
hill
in
nottinghamshire
a
fire
used
to
be
solemnly
kindled
every
year
on
beltane
eve
the
custom
seems
to
have
survived
down
to
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
old
people
could
remember
and
describe
the
ceremony
long
after
it
had
fallen
into
desuetude
the
beltane
fires
appear
to
have
been
kindled
also
in
ireland
for
cormac
or
somebody
in
his
name
says
that
was
so
called
from
the
lucky
fire
or
the
two
fires
which
the
druids
of
erin
used
to
make
on
that
day
with
great
incantations
and
cattle
he
adds
used
to
be
brought
to
those
fires
or
to
be
driven
between
them
as
a
safeguard
against
the
diseases
of
the
again
a
very
ancient
irish
poem
enumerating
the
may
day
celebrations
mentions
among
them
a
bonfire
on
a
hill
ar
and
another
old
authority
says
that
these
fires
were
kindled
in
the
name
of
the
bel
from
an
old
life
of
patrick
we
learn
that
on
a
day
in
spring
the
heathen
of
ireland
were
wont
to
extinguish
all
their
fires
until
a
new
fire
was
kindled
with
solemn
ceremony
in
the
king
s
house
at
tara
in
the
year
in
which
patrick
landed
in
ireland
it
chanced
that
the
night
of
the
extinguished
fires
coincided
with
the
eve
of
easter
and
the
saint
ignorant
of
this
pagan
superstition
resolved
to
celebrate
his
first
easter
in
ireland
after
the
true
christian
fashion
by
lighting
the
holy
paschal
fire
on
the
hill
of
slane
which
rises
high
above
the
left
bank
of
the
boyne
about
twelve
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
so
that
night
looking
from
his
palace
at
tara
across
the
darkened
landscape
the
king
of
tara
saw
the
solitary
fire
flaring
on
the
top
of
the
hill
of
slane
and
in
consternation
he
asked
his
wise
men
what
that
light
meant
they
warned
him
of
the
danger
that
it
betokened
for
the
ancient
faith
of
erin
in
spite
of
the
difference
of
date
between
easter
and
beltane
we
may
suspect
that
the
new
fire
annually
kindled
with
solemn
ceremony
about
easter
in
the
king
of
ireland
s
palace
at
tara
was
no
other
than
the
beltane
fire
we
have
seen
that
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
down
to
modern
times
it
was
customary
to
extinguish
all
fires
in
the
neighbourhood
before
proceeding
to
kindle
the
sacred
flame
the
irish
historian
geoffrey
keating
who
wrote
in
the
first
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
tells
us
that
the
men
of
ireland
held
a
great
fair
every
year
in
the
month
of
may
at
uisnech
in
the
county
of
meath
and
at
it
they
were
wont
to
exchange
their
goods
and
their
wares
and
their
jewels
at
it
they
were
also
wont
to
make
a
sacrifice
to
the
that
they
adored
whose
name
was
bèl
it
was
likewise
their
usage
to
light
two
fires
to
bèl
in
every
district
of
ireland
at
this
season
and
to
drive
a
pair
of
each
kind
of
cattle
that
the
district
contained
between
those
two
fires
as
a
preservative
to
guard
them
against
all
the
diseases
of
that
year
it
is
from
that
fire
thus
made
in
honour
of
bèl
that
the
day
the
first
of
may
on
which
the
noble
feast
of
the
apostles
philip
and
james
is
held
has
been
called
bèltaini
or
bèaltaine
for
beltaini
is
the
same
as
teiné
bhèil
or
bèl
s
the
custom
of
driving
cattle
through
or
between
fires
on
may
day
or
the
eve
of
may
day
persisted
in
ireland
down
to
a
time
within
living
memory
thus
sir
john
rhys
was
informed
by
a
manxman
that
an
irish
of
his
acquaintance
used
to
drive
his
cattle
through
fire
on
may
day
so
as
to
singe
them
a
little
since
he
believed
that
it
would
preserve
them
from
harm
when
the
manxman
was
asked
where
the
dealer
came
from
he
answered
from
the
mountains
over
there
pointing
to
the
mourne
mountains
then
looming
faintly
in
the
mists
on
the
western
horizon
the
first
of
may
is
a
great
popular
festival
in
the
more
midland
and
southern
parts
of
sweden
on
the
eve
of
the
festival
huge
bonfires
which
should
be
lighted
by
striking
two
flints
together
blaze
on
all
the
hills
and
knolls
every
large
hamlet
has
its
own
fire
round
which
the
young
people
dance
in
a
ring
the
old
folk
notice
whether
the
flames
incline
to
the
north
or
to
the
south
in
the
former
case
the
spring
will
be
cold
and
backward
in
the
latter
it
will
be
mild
and
genial
similarly
in
bohemia
on
the
eve
of
may
day
young
people
kindle
fires
on
hills
and
eminences
at
crossways
and
in
pastures
and
dance
round
them
they
leap
over
the
glowing
embers
or
even
through
the
flames
the
ceremony
is
called
burning
the
in
some
places
an
effigy
representing
a
witch
used
to
be
burnt
in
the
bonfire
we
have
to
remember
that
the
eve
of
may
day
is
the
notorious
walpurgis
night
when
the
witches
are
everywhere
speeding
unseen
through
the
air
on
their
hellish
errands
on
this
witching
night
children
in
voigtland
also
light
bonfires
on
the
heights
and
leap
over
them
moreover
they
wave
burning
brooms
or
toss
them
into
the
air
so
far
as
the
light
of
the
bonfire
reaches
so
far
will
a
blessing
rest
on
the
fields
the
kindling
of
the
fires
on
walpurgis
night
is
called
driving
away
the
the
custom
of
kindling
fires
on
the
eve
of
may
day
walpurgis
night
for
the
purpose
of
burning
the
witches
is
or
used
to
be
widespread
in
the
tyrol
moravia
saxony
and
silesia
the
midsummer
fires
but
the
season
at
which
these
have
been
mostly
generally
held
all
over
europe
is
the
summer
solstice
that
is
midsummer
eve
the
of
june
or
midsummer
day
the
of
june
a
faint
tinge
of
christianity
has
been
given
to
them
by
naming
midsummer
day
after
john
the
baptist
but
we
can
not
doubt
that
the
celebration
dates
from
a
time
long
before
the
beginning
of
our
era
the
summer
solstice
or
midsummer
day
is
the
great
in
the
sun
s
career
when
after
climbing
higher
and
higher
day
by
day
in
the
sky
the
luminary
stops
and
thenceforth
retraces
his
steps
down
the
heavenly
road
such
a
moment
could
not
but
be
regarded
with
anxiety
by
primitive
man
so
soon
as
he
began
to
observe
and
ponder
the
courses
of
the
great
lights
across
the
celestial
vault
and
having
still
to
learn
his
own
powerlessness
in
face
of
the
vast
cyclic
changes
of
nature
he
may
have
fancied
that
he
could
help
the
sun
in
his
seeming
prop
his
failing
steps
and
rekindle
the
sinking
flame
of
the
red
lamp
in
his
feeble
hand
in
some
such
thoughts
as
these
the
midsummer
festivals
of
our
european
peasantry
may
perhaps
have
taken
their
rise
whatever
their
origin
they
have
prevailed
all
over
this
quarter
of
the
globe
from
ireland
on
the
west
to
russia
on
the
east
and
from
norway
and
sweden
on
the
north
to
spain
and
greece
on
the
south
according
to
a
mediæval
writer
the
three
great
features
of
the
midsummer
celebration
were
the
bonfires
the
procession
with
torches
round
the
fields
and
the
custom
of
rolling
a
wheel
he
tells
us
that
boys
burned
bones
and
filth
of
various
kinds
to
make
a
foul
smoke
and
that
the
smoke
drove
away
certain
noxious
dragons
which
at
this
time
excited
by
the
summer
heat
copulated
in
the
air
and
poisoned
the
wells
and
rivers
by
dropping
their
seed
into
them
and
he
explains
the
custom
of
trundling
a
wheel
to
mean
that
the
sun
having
now
reached
the
highest
point
in
the
ecliptic
begins
thenceforward
to
descend
a
good
general
account
of
the
midsummer
customs
together
with
some
of
the
reasons
popularly
alleged
for
observing
them
is
given
by
thomas
kirchmeyer
a
writer
of
the
sixteenth
century
in
his
poem
popish
doth
the
joyfull

of

from

and

now
in
safetie
here
they
from
these
general
descriptions
which
to
some
extent
still
hold
good
or
did
so
till
lately
we
see
that
the
main
features
of
the
midsummer
resemble
those
which
we
have
found
to
characterize
the
vernal
festivals
of
fire
the
similarity
of
the
two
sets
of
ceremonies
will
plainly
appear
from
the
following
examples
a
writer
of
the
first
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
informs
us
that
in
almost
every
village
and
town
of
germany
public
bonfires
were
kindled
on
the
eve
of
john
and
young
and
old
of
both
sexes
gathered
about
them
and
passed
the
time
in
dancing
and
singing
people
on
this
occasion
wore
chaplets
of
mugwort
and
vervain
and
they
looked
at
the
fire
through
bunches
of
larkspur
which
they
held
in
their
hands
believing
that
this
would
preserve
their
eyes
in
a
healthy
state
throughout
the
year
as
each
departed
he
threw
the
mugwort
and
vervain
into
the
fire
saying
may
all
my
depart
and
be
burnt
up
with
at
lower
konz
a
village
prettily
situated
on
a
hillside
overlooking
the
moselle
in
the
midst
of
a
wood
of
and
the
midsummer
festival
used
to
be
celebrated
as
follows
a
quantity
of
straw
was
collected
on
the
top
of
the
steep
stromberg
hill
every
inhabitant
or
at
least
every
householder
had
to
contribute
his
share
of
straw
to
the
pile
a
recusant
was
looked
at
askance
and
if
in
the
course
of
the
year
he
happened
to
break
a
leg
or
lose
a
child
there
was
not
a
gossip
in
the
village
but
knew
the
reason
why
at
nightfall
the
whole
male
population
men
and
boys
mustered
on
the
top
of
the
hill
the
women
and
girls
were
not
allowed
to
join
them
but
had
to
take
up
their
position
at
a
certain
spring
down
the
slope
on
the
summit
stood
a
huge
wheel
completely
encased
in
some
of
the
straw
which
had
been
jointly
contributed
by
the
villagers
the
rest
of
the
straw
was
made
into
torches
from
each
side
of
the
wheel
the
projected
about
three
feet
thus
furnishing
handles
to
the
lads
who
were
to
guide
it
in
its
descent
the
mayor
of
the
neighbouring
town
of
sierck
who
always
received
a
basket
of
cherries
for
his
services
gave
the
signal
a
lighted
torch
was
applied
to
the
wheel
and
as
it
burst
into
flame
two
young
fellows
and
swift
of
foot
seized
the
handles
and
began
running
with
it
down
the
slope
a
great
shout
went
up
every
man
and
boy
waved
a
blazing
torch
in
the
air
and
took
care
to
keep
it
alight
so
long
as
the
wheel
was
trundling
down
the
hill
some
of
them
followed
the
fiery
wheel
and
watched
with
amusement
the
shifts
to
which
its
guides
were
put
in
steering
it
round
the
hollows
and
over
the
broken
ground
on
the
mountainside
the
great
object
of
the
young
men
who
guided
the
wheel
was
to
plunge
it
blazing
into
the
water
of
the
moselle
but
they
rarely
succeeded
in
their
efforts
for
the
vineyards
which
cover
the
greater
part
of
the
declivity
impeded
their
progress
and
the
wheel
was
often
burned
out
before
it
reached
the
river
as
it
rolled
past
the
women
and
girls
at
the
spring
they
raised
cries
of
joy
which
were
answered
by
the
men
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
and
the
shouts
were
echoed
by
the
inhabitants
of
neighbouring
villages
who
watched
the
spectacle
from
their
hills
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
moselle
if
the
fiery
wheel
was
successfully
conveyed
to
the
bank
of
the
river
and
extinguished
in
the
water
the
people
looked
for
an
abundant
vintage
that
year
and
the
inhabitants
of
konz
had
the
right
to
exact
a
of
white
wine
from
the
surrounding
vineyards
on
the
other
hand
they
believed
that
if
they
neglected
to
perform
the
ceremony
the
cattle
would
be
attacked
by
giddiness
and
convulsions
and
would
dance
in
their
stalls
down
at
least
to
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
midsummer
fires
used
to
blaze
all
over
upper
bavaria
they
were
kindled
especially
on
the
mountains
but
also
far
and
wide
in
the
lowlands
and
we
are
told
that
in
the
darkness
and
stillness
of
night
the
moving
groups
lit
up
by
the
flickering
glow
of
the
flames
presented
an
impressive
spectacle
in
some
places
the
people
shewed
their
sense
of
the
sanctity
of
the
fires
by
using
for
fuel
the
trees
past
which
the
gay
procession
had
defiled
with
fluttering
banners
on
corpus
christi
day
in
others
the
children
collected
the
firewood
from
door
to
door
on
the
eve
of
the
festival
singing
their
request
for
fuel
at
every
house
in
doggerel
verse
cattle
were
driven
through
the
fire
to
cure
the
sick
animals
and
to
guard
such
as
were
sound
against
plague
and
harm
of
every
kind
throughout
the
year
many
a
householder
on
that
day
put
out
the
fire
on
the
domestic
hearth
and
rekindled
it
by
means
of
a
brand
taken
from
the
midsummer
bonfire
the
people
judged
of
the
height
to
which
the
flax
would
grow
in
the
year
by
the
height
to
which
the
flames
of
the
bonfire
rose
and
whoever
leaped
over
the
burning
pile
was
sure
not
to
suffer
from
backache
in
reaping
the
corn
at
harvest
but
it
was
especially
the
practice
for
lovers
to
spring
over
the
fire
hand
in
hand
and
the
way
in
which
each
couple
made
the
leap
was
the
subject
of
many
a
jest
and
many
a
superstition
in
one
district
the
custom
of
kindling
the
bonfires
was
combined
with
that
of
lighting
wooden
discs
and
hurling
them
in
the
air
after
the
manner
which
prevails
at
some
of
the
spring
festivals
in
many
parts
of
bavaria
it
was
believed
that
the
flax
would
grow
as
high
as
the
young
people
leaped
over
the
fire
in
others
the
old
folk
used
to
plant
three
charred
sticks
from
the
bonfire
in
the
fields
believing
that
this
would
make
the
flax
grow
tall
elsewhere
an
extinguished
brand
was
put
in
the
roof
of
the
house
to
protect
it
against
fire
in
the
towns
about
würzburg
the
bonfires
used
to
be
kindled
in
the
and
the
young
people
who
jumped
over
them
wore
garlands
of
flowers
especially
of
mugwort
and
vervain
and
carried
sprigs
of
larkspur
in
their
hands
they
thought
that
such
as
looked
at
the
fire
holding
a
bit
of
larkspur
before
their
face
would
be
troubled
by
no
malady
of
the
eyes
throughout
the
year
further
it
was
customary
at
würzburg
in
the
sixteenth
century
for
the
bishop
s
followers
to
throw
burning
discs
of
wood
into
the
air
from
a
mountain
which
overhangs
the
town
the
discs
were
discharged
by
means
of
flexible
rods
and
in
their
flight
through
the
darkness
presented
the
appearance
of
fiery
dragons
in
the
valley
of
the
lech
which
divides
upper
bavaria
from
swabia
the
midsummer
customs
and
beliefs
are
or
used
to
be
very
similar
bonfires
are
kindled
on
the
mountains
on
midsummer
day
and
besides
the
bonfire
a
tall
beam
thickly
wrapt
in
straw
and
surmounted
by
a
is
burned
in
many
places
round
this
cross
as
it
burns
the
lads
dance
with
loud
shouts
and
when
the
flames
have
subsided
the
young
people
leap
over
the
fire
in
pairs
a
young
man
and
a
young
woman
together
if
they
escape
unsmirched
the
man
will
not
suffer
from
fever
and
the
girl
will
not
become
a
mother
within
the
year
further
it
is
believed
that
the
flax
will
grow
that
year
as
high
as
they
leap
over
the
fire
and
that
if
a
charred
billet
be
taken
from
the
fire
and
stuck
in
a
it
will
promote
the
growth
of
the
flax
similarly
in
swabia
lads
and
lasses
hand
in
hand
leap
over
the
midsummer
bonfire
praying
that
the
hemp
may
grow
three
ells
high
and
they
set
fire
to
wheels
of
straw
and
send
them
rolling
down
the
hill
among
the
places
where
burning
wheels
were
thus
bowled
down
hill
at
midsummer
were
the
hohenstaufen
mountains
in
wurtemberg
and
the
frauenberg
near
gerhausen
at
deffingen
in
swabia
as
the
people
sprang
over
the
midsummer
bonfire
they
cried
out
flax
flax
may
the
flax
this
year
grow
seven
ells
high
at
rottenburg
in
swabia
down
to
the
year
or
the
festival
was
marked
by
some
special
features
about
troops
of
boys
went
about
the
town
begging
for
firewood
at
the
houses
in
each
troop
there
were
three
leaders
one
of
whom
carried
a
dagger
a
second
a
paper
banner
and
a
third
a
white
plate
covered
with
a
white
cloth
these
three
entered
each
house
and
recited
verses
in
which
they
expressed
an
intention
of
roasting
martin
luther
and
sending
him
to
the
devil
and
for
this
meritorious
service
they
expected
to
be
paid
the
contributions
being
received
in
the
plate
in
the
evening
they
counted
up
their
money
and
proceeded
to
behead
the
for
this
ceremony
an
open
space
was
chosen
sometimes
in
the
middle
of
the
town
here
a
stake
was
thrust
into
the
ground
and
straw
wrapt
about
it
so
as
to
make
a
rude
effigy
of
human
form
with
arms
head
and
face
every
boy
brought
a
handful
of
nosegays
and
fastened
them
to
the
who
was
thus
enveloped
in
flowers
fuel
was
heaped
about
the
stake
and
set
on
fire
when
the
as
the
was
called
blazed
up
all
the
boys
of
the
neighbourhood
who
had
gathered
expectantly
around
fell
upon
him
with
their
wooden
swords
and
hewed
him
to
pieces
as
soon
as
he
had
vanished
in
smoke
and
flame
the
lads
leaped
backward
and
forward
over
the
glowing
embers
and
later
in
the
evening
they
feasted
on
the
proceeds
of
their
collection
here
the
burnt
in
the
fire
appears
to
be
identified
with
martin
luther
to
whom
as
we
have
seen
allusion
was
made
during
the
visitation
the
identification
was
probably
modern
for
we
may
assume
that
the
custom
of
burning
an
effigy
in
the
midsummer
bonfire
is
far
older
than
the
time
of
luther
in
baden
the
children
used
to
collect
fuel
from
house
to
house
for
the
midsummer
bonfire
on
john
s
day
and
lads
and
lasses
leaped
over
the
fire
in
couples
here
as
elsewhere
a
close
connexion
was
traced
between
these
bonfires
and
the
harvest
in
some
places
it
was
thought
that
those
who
leaped
over
the
fires
would
not
suffer
from
backache
at
reaping
sometimes
as
the
young
folk
sprang
over
the
flames
they
cried
grow
that
the
hemp
may
be
three
ells
high
this
notion
that
the
hemp
or
the
corn
would
grow
as
high
as
the
flames
blazed
or
as
the
people
jumped
over
them
seems
to
have
been
widespread
in
baden
it
was
held
that
the
parents
of
the
young
people
who
bounded
highest
over
the
fire
would
have
the
most
abundant
harvest
and
on
the
other
hand
if
a
man
contributed
nothing
to
the
bonfire
it
was
imagined
that
there
would
be
no
blessing
on
his
crops
and
that
his
hemp
in
particular
would
never
grow
in
the
neighbourhood
of
bühl
and
achern
the
john
s
fires
were
kindled
on
the
tops
of
hills
only
the
unmarried
lads
of
the
village
brought
the
fuel
and
only
the
unmarried
young
men
and
women
sprang
through
the
flames
but
most
of
the
villagers
old
and
young
gathered
round
the
bonfires
leaving
a
clear
space
for
the
leapers
to
take
their
run
one
of
the
bystanders
would
call
out
the
names
of
a
pair
of
sweethearts
on
which
the
two
would
step
out
from
the
throng
take
each
other
by
the
hand
and
leap
high
and
lightly
through
the
swirling
smoke
and
flames
while
the
spectators
watched
them
critically
and
drew
omens
of
their
married
life
from
the
height
to
which
each
of
them
bounded
such
an
invitation
to
jump
together
over
the
bonfire
was
regarded
as
tantamount
to
a
public
betrothal
near
offenburg
in
the
black
forest
on
midsummer
day
the
village
boys
used
to
collect
faggots
and
straw
on
some
steep
and
conspicuous
height
and
they
spent
some
time
in
making
circular
wooden
discs
by
slicing
the
trunk
of
a
across
when
darkness
had
fallen
they
kindled
the
bonfire
and
then
as
it
blazed
up
they
lighted
the
discs
at
it
and
after
swinging
them
to
and
fro
at
the
end
of
a
stout
and
supple
they
hurled
them
one
after
the
other
whizzing
and
flaming
into
the
air
where
they
described
great
arcs
of
fire
to
fall
at
length
like
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
in
many
parts
of
alsace
and
lorraine
the
midsummer
fires
still
blaze
annually
or
did
so
not
very
many
years
ago
at
speicher
in
the
eifel
a
district
which
lies
on
the
middle
rhine
to
the
west
of
coblentz
a
bonfire
used
to
be
kindled
in
front
of
the
village
on
john
s
day
and
all
the
young
people
had
to
jump
over
it
those
who
failed
to
do
so
were
not
allowed
to
join
the
rest
in
begging
for
eggs
from
house
to
house
where
no
eggs
were
given
they
drove
a
wedge
into
the
keyhole
of
the
door
on
this
day
children
in
the
eifel
used
also
to
gather
flowers
in
the
fields
weave
them
into
garlands
and
throw
the
garlands
on
the
roofs
or
hang
them
on
the
doors
of
the
houses
so
long
as
the
flowers
remained
there
they
were
supposed
to
guard
the
house
from
fire
and
lightning
in
the
southern
harz
district
and
in
thuringia
the
midsummer
or
john
s
fires
used
to
be
commonly
lighted
down
to
about
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
the
custom
has
probably
not
died
out
at
edersleben
near
sangerhausen
a
high
pole
was
planted
in
the
ground
and
a
was
hung
from
it
by
a
chain
which
reached
to
the
ground
the
barrel
was
then
set
on
fire
and
swung
round
the
pole
amid
shouts
of
joy
according
to
one
account
german
tradition
required
that
the
midsummer
fire
should
be
lighted
not
from
a
common
hearth
but
by
the
friction
of
two
sorts
of
wood
namely
oak
and
fir
in
some
old
of
the
surenthal
and
winenthal
in
switzerland
a
couple
of
holes
or
a
whole
row
of
them
may
be
seen
facing
each
other
in
the
of
the
barn
or
stable
sometimes
the
holes
are
smooth
and
round
sometimes
they
are
deeply
burnt
and
blackened
the
explanation
of
them
is
this
about
midsummer
but
especially
on
midsummer
day
two
such
holes
are
bored
opposite
each
other
into
which
the
extremities
of
a
strong
pole
are
fixed
the
holes
are
then
stuffed
with
tow
steeped
in
resin
and
oil
a
rope
is
looped
round
the
pole
and
two
young
men
who
must
be
brothers
or
must
have
the
same
baptismal
name
and
must
be
of
the
same
age
pull
the
ends
of
the
rope
backwards
and
forwards
so
as
to
make
the
pole
revolve
rapidly
till
smoke
and
sparks
issue
from
the
two
holes
in
the
the
sparks
are
caught
and
blown
up
with
tinder
and
this
is
the
new
and
pure
fire
the
appearance
of
which
is
greeted
with
cries
of
joy
heaps
of
combustible
materials
are
now
ignited
with
the
new
fire
and
blazing
bundles
are
placed
on
boards
and
sent
floating
down
the
brook
the
boys
light
torches
at
the
new
fire
and
run
to
fumigate
the
pastures
this
is
believed
to
drive
away
all
the
demons
and
witches
that
molest
the
cattle
finally
the
torches
are
thrown
in
a
heap
on
the
meadow
and
allowed
to
burn
out
on
their
way
back
the
boys
strew
the
ashes
over
the
fields
which
is
supposed
to
make
them
fertile
if
a
farmer
has
taken
possession
of
a
new
house
or
if
servants
have
changed
masters
the
boys
fumigate
the
new
abode
and
are
rewarded
by
the
farmer
with
a
supper
in
silesia
from
the
part
of
the
sudeten
range
and
as
far
as
lausitz
the
mountains
are
ablaze
with
bonfires
on
midsummer
eve
and
from
the
valleys
and
the
plains
round
about
leobschütz
neustadt
zülz
oels
and
other
places
answering
fires
twinkle
through
the
deepening
gloom
while
they
are
smouldering
and
sending
forth
volumes
of
smoke
across
the
fields
young
men
kindle
soaked
in
pitch
at
the
bonfires
and
then
brandishing
the
stumps
which
emit
showers
of
sparks
they
chase
one
another
or
dance
with
the
girls
round
the
burning
pile
shots
too
are
fired
and
shouts
raised
the
fire
the
smoke
the
shots
and
the
shouts
are
all
intended
to
scare
away
the
witches
who
are
let
loose
on
this
witching
day
and
who
would
certainly
work
harm
to
the
crops
and
the
cattle
if
they
were
not
deterred
by
these
salutary
measures
mere
contact
with
the
fire
brings
all
sorts
of
blessings
hence
when
the
bonfire
is
burning
low
the
lads
leap
over
it
and
the
higher
they
bound
the
better
is
the
luck
in
store
for
them
he
who
surpasses
his
fellows
is
the
hero
of
the
day
and
is
much
admired
by
the
village
girls
it
is
also
thought
to
be
very
good
for
the
eyes
to
stare
steadily
at
the
bonfire
without
blinking
moreover
he
who
does
so
will
not
drowse
and
fall
asleep
betimes
in
the
long
winter
evenings
on
midsummer
eve
the
windows
and
doors
of
houses
in
silesia
are
crowned
with
flowers
especially
with
the
blue
and
the
bright
in
some
villages
long
strings
of
garlands
and
nosegays
are
stretched
across
the
streets
the
people
believe
that
on
that
night
john
comes
down
from
heaven
to
bless
the
flowers
and
to
keep
all
evil
things
from
house
and
home
in
denmark
and
norway
also
midsummer
fires
were
kindled
on
john
s
eve
on
roads
open
spaces
and
hills
people
in
norway
thought
that
the
fires
banished
sickness
from
among
the
cattle
even
yet
the
fires
are
said
to
be
lighted
all
over
norway
on
the
night
of
june
the
midsummer
eve
old
style
as
many
as
fifty
or
sixty
bonfires
may
often
be
counted
burning
on
the
hills
round
bergen
sometimes
fuel
is
piled
on
rafts
ignited
and
allowed
to
drift
blazing
across
the
fiords
in
the
darkness
of
night
the
fires
are
thought
to
be
kindled
in
order
to
keep
off
the
witches
who
are
said
to
be
flying
from
all
parts
that
night
to
the
blocksberg
where
the
big
witch
lives
in
sweden
the
eve
of
john
hans
is
the
most
joyous
night
of
the
whole
year
throughout
some
parts
of
the
country
especially
in
the
provinces
of
bohus
and
scania
and
in
districts
bordering
on
norway
it
is
celebrated
by
the
frequent
discharge
of
firearms
and
by
huge
bonfires
formerly
called
balder
s
balefires
s
which
are
kindled
at
dusk
on
hills
and
eminences
and
throw
a
glare
of
light
over
the
surrounding
landscape
the
people
dance
round
the
fires
and
leap
over
or
through
them
in
parts
of
norrland
on
john
s
eve
the
bonfires
are
lit
at
the
the
fuel
consists
of
nine
different
sorts
of
wood
and
the
spectators
cast
into
the
flames
a
kind
of
in
order
to
counteract
the
power
of
the
trolls
and
other
evil
spirits
who
are
believed
to
be
abroad
that
night
for
at
that
mystic
season
the
mountains
open
and
from
their
cavernous
depths
the
uncanny
crew
pours
forth
to
dance
and
disport
themselves
for
a
time
the
peasants
believe
that
should
any
of
the
trolls
be
in
the
vicinity
they
will
shew
themselves
and
if
an
animal
for
example
a
he
or
she
goat
happens
to
be
seen
near
the
blazing
crackling
pile
the
peasants
are
firmly
persuaded
that
it
is
no
other
than
the
evil
one
in
person
further
it
deserves
to
be
remarked
that
in
sweden
john
s
eve
is
a
festival
of
water
as
well
as
of
fire
for
certain
holy
springs
are
then
supposed
to
be
endowed
with
wonderful
medicinal
virtues
and
many
sick
people
resort
to
them
for
the
healing
of
their
infirmities
in
switzerland
on
midsummer
eve
fires
are
or
used
to
be
kindled
on
high
places
in
the
cantons
of
bern
neuchatel
valais
and
geneva
in
austria
the
midsummer
customs
and
superstitions
resemble
those
of
germany
thus
in
some
parts
of
the
tyrol
bonfires
are
kindled
and
burning
discs
hurled
into
the
air
in
the
lower
valley
of
the
inn
a
taterdemalian
effigy
is
carted
about
the
village
on
midsummer
day
and
then
burned
he
is
called
the
which
has
been
corrupted
into
luther
at
ambras
one
of
the
villages
where
martin
luther
is
thus
burned
in
effigy
they
say
that
if
you
go
through
the
village
between
eleven
and
twelve
on
john
s
night
and
wash
yourself
in
three
wells
you
will
see
all
who
are
to
die
in
the
following
year
at
gratz
on
john
s
eve
the
of
june
the
common
people
used
to
make
a
puppet
called
the
which
they
dragged
to
the
bleaching
ground
and
pelted
with
burning
besoms
till
it
took
fire
at
reutte
in
the
tyrol
people
believed
that
the
flax
would
grow
as
high
as
they
leaped
over
the
midsummer
bonfire
and
they
took
pieces
of
charred
wood
from
the
fire
and
stuck
them
in
their
the
same
night
leaving
them
there
till
the
flax
harvest
had
been
got
in
in
lower
austria
fires
are
lit
in
the
fields
commonly
in
front
of
a
cross
and
the
people
dance
and
sing
round
them
and
throw
flowers
into
the
flames
before
each
handful
of
flowers
is
tossed
into
the
fire
a
set
speech
is
made
then
the
dance
is
resumed
and
the
dancers
sing
in
chorus
the
last
words
of
the
speech
at
evening
bonfires
are
kindled
on
the
heights
and
the
boys
caper
round
them
brandishing
lighted
torches
drenched
in
pitch
whoever
jumps
thrice
across
the
fire
will
not
suffer
from
fever
within
the
year
are
often
smeared
with
pitch
ignited
and
sent
rolling
and
blazing
down
the
hillsides
all
over
bohemia
bonfires
still
burn
on
midsummer
eve
in
the
afternoon
boys
go
about
with
handcarts
from
house
to
house
collecting
fuel
such
as
sticks
brushwood
old
besoms
and
so
forth
they
make
their
request
at
each
house
in
rhyming
verses
threatening
with
evil
consequences
the
curmudgeons
who
refuse
them
a
dole
sometimes
the
young
men
fell
a
tall
straight
fir
in
the
woods
and
set
it
up
on
a
height
where
the
girls
deck
it
with
nosegays
wreaths
of
leaves
and
red
ribbons
then
brushwood
is
piled
about
it
and
at
nightfall
the
whole
is
set
on
fire
while
the
flames
break
out
the
young
men
climb
the
tree
and
fetch
down
the
wreaths
which
the
girls
had
placed
on
it
after
that
lads
and
lasses
stand
on
opposite
sides
of
the
fire
and
look
at
one
another
through
the
wreaths
to
see
whether
they
will
be
true
to
each
other
and
marry
within
the
year
also
the
girls
throw
the
wreaths
across
the
flames
to
the
men
and
woe
to
the
awkward
swain
who
fails
to
catch
the
wreath
thrown
him
by
his
sweetheart
when
the
blaze
has
died
down
each
couple
takes
hands
and
leaps
thrice
across
the
fire
he
or
she
who
does
so
will
be
free
from
ague
throughout
the
year
and
the
flax
will
grow
as
high
as
the
young
folks
leap
a
girl
who
sees
nine
bonfires
on
midsummer
eve
will
marry
before
the
year
is
out
the
singed
wreaths
are
carried
home
and
carefully
preserved
throughout
the
year
during
thunderstorms
a
bit
of
the
wreath
is
burned
on
the
hearth
with
a
prayer
some
of
it
is
given
to
kine
that
are
sick
or
calving
and
some
of
it
serves
to
fumigate
house
and
that
man
and
beast
may
keep
hale
and
well
sometimes
an
old
is
smeared
with
resin
ignited
and
sent
rolling
down
the
hill
often
the
boys
collect
all
the
besoms
they
can
get
hold
of
dip
them
in
pitch
and
having
set
them
on
fire
wave
them
about
or
throw
them
high
into
the
air
or
they
rush
down
the
hillside
in
troops
brandishing
the
flaming
brooms
and
shouting
only
however
to
return
to
the
bonfire
on
the
summit
when
the
brooms
have
burnt
out
the
stumps
of
the
brooms
and
embers
from
the
fire
are
preserved
and
stuck
in
cabbage
gardens
to
protect
the
cabbages
from
caterpillars
and
gnats
some
people
insert
charred
sticks
and
ashes
from
the
bonfire
in
their
sown
fields
and
meadows
in
their
gardens
and
the
roofs
of
their
houses
as
a
talisman
against
lightning
and
foul
weather
or
they
fancy
that
the
ashes
placed
in
the
roof
will
prevent
any
fire
from
breaking
out
in
the
house
in
some
districts
they
crown
or
gird
themselves
with
mugwort
while
the
midsummer
fire
is
burning
for
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
protection
against
ghosts
witches
and
sickness
in
particular
a
wreath
of
mugwort
is
a
sure
preventive
of
sore
eyes
sometimes
the
girls
look
at
the
bonfires
through
garlands
of
wild
flowers
praying
the
fire
to
strengthen
their
eyes
and
eyelids
she
who
does
this
thrice
will
have
no
sore
eyes
all
that
year
in
some
parts
of
bohemia
they
used
to
drive
the
cows
through
the
midsummer
fire
to
guard
them
against
witchcraft
the
germans
of
moravia
in
like
manner
still
light
bonfires
on
open
grounds
and
high
places
on
midsummer
eve
and
they
kindle
besoms
in
the
flames
and
then
stick
the
charred
stumps
in
the
as
a
powerful
protection
against
caterpillars
on
the
same
mystic
evening
moravian
girls
gather
flowers
of
nine
sorts
and
lay
them
under
their
pillow
when
they
go
to
sleep
then
they
dream
every
one
of
him
who
is
to
be
her
partner
for
life
for
in
moravia
maidens
in
their
beds
as
well
as
poets
by
haunted
streams
have
their
midsummer
night
s
dreams
in
austrian
silesia
the
custom
also
prevails
of
lighting
great
bonfires
on
hilltops
on
midsummer
eve
and
here
too
the
boys
swing
blazing
besoms
or
hurl
them
high
in
the
air
while
they
shout
and
leap
and
dance
wildly
next
morning
every
door
is
decked
with
flowers
and
birchen
saplings
in
the
district
of
cracow
especially
towards
the
carpathian
mountains
great
fires
are
kindled
by
the
peasants
in
the
fields
or
on
the
heights
at
nightfall
on
midsummer
eve
which
among
them
goes
by
the
name
of
kupalo
s
night
the
fire
must
be
kindled
by
the
friction
of
two
sticks
the
young
people
dance
round
or
leap
over
it
and
a
band
of
sturdy
fellows
run
a
race
with
lighted
torches
the
winner
being
rewarded
with
a
peacock
s
feather
which
he
keeps
throughout
the
year
as
a
distinction
cattle
also
are
driven
round
the
fire
in
the
belief
that
this
is
a
charm
against
pestilence
and
disease
of
every
sort
the
name
of
kupalo
s
night
applied
in
this
part
of
galicia
to
midsummer
eve
reminds
us
that
we
have
now
passed
from
german
to
slavonic
ground
even
in
bohemia
the
midsummer
celebration
is
common
to
slavs
and
germans
we
have
already
seen
that
in
russia
the
summer
solstice
or
eve
of
john
is
celebrated
by
young
men
and
maidens
who
jump
over
a
bonfire
in
couples
carrying
a
straw
effigy
of
kupalo
in
their
arms
in
some
parts
of
russia
an
image
of
kupalo
is
burnt
or
thrown
into
a
stream
on
john
s
night
again
in
some
districts
of
russia
the
young
folk
wear
garlands
of
flowers
and
girdles
of
holy
herbs
when
they
spring
through
the
smoke
or
flames
and
sometimes
they
drive
the
cattle
also
through
the
fire
in
order
to
protect
the
animals
against
wizards
and
witches
who
are
then
ravenous
after
milk
in
little
russia
a
stake
is
driven
into
the
ground
on
john
s
night
wrapt
in
straw
and
set
on
fire
as
the
flames
rise
the
peasant
women
throw
birchen
boughs
into
them
saying
may
my
flax
be
as
tall
as
this
bough
in
ruthenia
the
bonfires
are
lighted
by
a
flame
procured
by
the
friction
of
wood
while
the
elders
of
the
party
are
engaged
in
thus
churning
the
fire
the
rest
maintain
a
respectful
silence
but
when
the
flame
bursts
from
the
wood
they
break
forth
into
joyous
songs
as
soon
as
the
bonfires
are
kindled
the
young
people
take
hands
and
leap
in
pairs
through
the
smoke
if
not
through
the
flames
and
after
that
the
cattle
in
their
turn
are
driven
through
the
fire
in
many
parts
of
prussia
and
lithuania
great
fires
are
kindled
on
midsummer
eve
all
the
heights
are
ablaze
with
them
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
the
fires
are
supposed
to
be
a
protection
against
witchcraft
thunder
hail
and
cattle
disease
especially
if
next
morning
the
cattle
are
driven
over
the
places
where
the
fires
burned
above
all
the
bonfires
ensure
the
farmer
against
the
arts
of
witches
who
try
to
steal
the
milk
from
his
cows
by
charms
and
spells
that
is
why
next
morning
you
may
see
the
young
fellows
who
lit
the
bonfire
going
from
house
to
house
and
receiving
jugfuls
of
milk
and
for
the
same
reason
they
stick
burs
and
mugwort
on
the
gate
or
the
hedge
through
which
the
cows
go
to
pasture

so
long

in

barges
crowned
with
flowers
and
crowded
with
revellers
used
to
float
down
the
tiber

the
of

no

the
strains

wafted

kindled
by
the

slavonian
peasantry
on

dance
and
shout
round
them
in
the
usual
way
the
very
names
of
john

the
john

are
said
to
act

throw
nine
old

into

and
when
these
burst
into

the

who
are

for

jump
through

he
who
succeeds
in

he
or
she
who
leaps
furthest
will
soonest
wed
afterwards

dance
in
separate
rings
but
the
ring
of
lads
bumps
up
against
the
ring
of

and
breaks
it
and
the

hereafter

light
torches
of

march
round

sheepfolds
and
then
they
climb
the
hills
and
there
allow
the
torches
to
burn
out
among
the
magyars
in
hungary
the
midsummer
is
marked
by
the
same
features
that
meet
us
in
so
many
parts
of
europe
on
midsummer
eve
in
many
places
it
is
customary
to
kindle
bonfires
on
heights
and
to
leap
over
them
and
from
the
manner
in
which
the
young
people
leap
the
bystanders
predict
whether
they
will
marry
soon
at
the
young
men
and
women
each
carrying
a
truss
of
straw
repair
to
a
meadow
where
they
pile
the
straw
in
seven
or
twelve
heaps
and
set
it
on
fire
then
they
go
round
the
fire
singing
and
hold
a
bunch
of
in
the
smoke
while
they
say
no
boil
on
my
body
no
sprain
in
my
foot
this
holding
of
the
flowers
over
the
flames
is
regarded
we
are
told
as
equally
important
with
the
practice
of
walking
through
the
fire
barefoot
and
stamping
it
out
on
this
day
also
many
hungarian
swineherds
make
fire
by
rotating
a
wheel
round
a
wooden
axle
wrapt
in
hemp
and
through
the
fire
thus
made
they
drive
their
pigs
to
preserve
them
from
sickness
in
villages
on
the
danube
where
the
population
is
a
cross
between
magyar
and
german
the
young
men
and
maidens
go
to
the
high
banks
of
the
river
on
midsummer
eve
and
while
the
girls
post
themselves
low
down
the
slope
the
lads
on
the
height
above
set
fire
to
little
wooden
wheels
and
after
swinging
them
to
and
fro
at
the
end
of
a
wand
send
them
whirling
through
the
air
to
fall
into
the
danube
as
he
does
so
each
lad
sings
out
the
name
of
his
sweetheart
and
she
listens
well
pleased
down
below
the
esthonians
of
russia
who
like
the
magyars
belong
to
the
great
turanian
family
of
mankind
also
celebrate
the
summer
solstice
in
the
usual
way
on
the
eve
of
john
all
the
people
of
a
farm
a
village
or
an
estate
walk
solemnly
in
procession
the
girls
decked
with
flowers
the
men
with
leaves
and
carrying
bundles
of
straw
under
their
arms
the
lads
carry
lighted
torches
or
flaming
hoops
steeped
in
tar
at
the
top
of
long
poles
thus
they
go
singing
to
the
the
granaries
and
so
forth
and
afterwards
march
thrice
round
the
finally
preceded
by
the
shrill
music
of
the
bagpipes
and
shawms
they
repair
to
a
neighbouring
hill
where
the
materials
of
a
bonfire
have
been
collected
filled
with
combustibles
are
hung
on
poles
or
the
trunk
of
a
felled
tree
has
been
set
up
with
a
great
mass
of
juniper
piled
about
it
in
the
form
of
a
pyramid
when
a
light
has
been
set
to
the
pile
old
and
young
gather
about
it
and
pass
the
time
merrily
with
song
and
music
till
break
of
day
every
one
who
comes
brings
fresh
fuel
for
the
fire
and
they
say
now
we
all
gather
together
where
john
s
fire
burns
he
who
comes
not
to
john
s
fire
will
have
his
barley
full
of
thistles
and
his
oats
full
of
three
logs
are
thrown
into
the
fire
with
special
ceremony
in
throwing
the
first
they
say
gold
of
pleasure
a
plant
with
yellow
flowers
into
the
fire
in
throwing
the
second
they
say
weeds
to
the
unploughed
land
but
in
throwing
the
third
they
cry
flax
on
my
field
the
fire
is
said
to
keep
the
witches
from
the
cattle
according
to
others
it
ensures
that
for
the
whole
year
the
milk
shall
be
as
pure
as
silver
and
as
the
stars
in
the
sky
and
the
butter
as
yellow
as
the
sun
and
the
fire
and
the
in
the
esthonian
island
of
oesel
while
they
throw
fuel
into
the
midsummer
fire
they
call
out
weeds
to
the
fire
flax
to
the
field
or
they
fling
three
billets
into
the
flames
saying
flax
grow
long
and
they
take
charred
sticks
from
the
bonfire
home
with
them
and
keep
them
to
make
the
cattle
thrive
in
some
parts
of
the
island
the
bonfire
is
formed
by
piling
brushwood
and
other
combustibles
round
a
tree
at
the
top
of
which
a
flag
flies
whoever
succeeds
in
knocking
down
the
flag
with
a
pole
before
it
begins
to
burn
will
have
good
luck
formerly
the
festivities
lasted
till
daybreak
and
ended
in
scenes
of
debauchery
which
looked
doubly
hideous
by
the
growing
light
of
a
summer
morning
still
farther
north
among
a
people
of
the
same
turanian
stock
we
learn
from
an
that
midsummer
night
used
to
witness
a
sort
of
witches
sabbath
on
the
top
of
every
hill
in
finland
the
bonfire
was
made
by
setting
up
four
tall
birches
in
a
square
and
piling
the
intermediate
space
with
fuel
round
the
roaring
flames
the
people
sang
and
drank
and
gambolled
in
the
usual
way
farther
east
in
the
valley
of
the
volga
the
cheremiss
celebrate
about
midsummer
a
festival
which
haxthausen
regarded
as
identical
with
the
midsummer
ceremonies
of
the
rest
of
europe
a
sacred
tree
in
the
forest
generally
a
tall
and
solitary
oak
marks
the
scene
of
the
solemnity
all
the
males
assemble
there
but
no
woman
may
be
present
a
heathen
priest
lights
seven
fires
in
a
row
from
to
cattle
are
sacrificed
and
their
blood
poured
in
the
fires
each
of
which
is
dedicated
to
a
separate
deity
afterwards
the
holy
tree
is
illumined
by
lighted
candles
placed
on
its
branches
the
people
fall
on
their
knees
and
with
faces
bowed
to
the
earth
pray
that
god
would
be
pleased
to
bless
them
their
children
their
cattle
and
their
bees
grant
them
success
in
trade
in
travel
and
in
the
chase
enable
them
to
pay
the
czar
s
taxes
and
so
forth
when
we
pass
from
the
east
to
the
west
of
europe
we
still
find
the
summer
solstice
celebrated
with
rites
of
the
same
general
character
down
to
about
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
custom
of
lighting
bonfires
at
midsummer
prevailed
so
commonly
in
france
that
there
was
hardly
a
town
or
a
village
we
are
told
where
they
were
not
kindled
though
the
pagan
origin
of
the
custom
may
be
regarded
as
certain
the
catholic
church
threw
a
christian
cloak
over
it
by
boldly
declaring
that
the
bonfires
were
lit
in
token
of
the
general
rejoicing
at
the
birth
of
the
baptist
who
opportunely
came
into
the
world
at
the
solstice
of
summer
just
as
his
greater
successor
did
at
the
solstice
of
winter
so
that
the
whole
year
might
be
said
to
revolve
on
the
golden
hinges
of
these
two
great
birthdays
writing
in
the
seventeenth
century
bishop
bossuet
expressly
affirms
this
edifying
theory
of
the
midsummer
bonfires
and
he
tells
his
catechumens
that
the
church
herself
participated
in
the
illumination
since
in
several
dioceses
including
his
own
diocese
of
meaux
a
number
of
parishes
kindled
what
were
called
ecclesiastical
fires
for
the
purpose
of
banishing
the
superstitions
practised
at
the
purely
mundane
bonfires
these
superstitions
he
goes
on
to
say
consisted
in
dancing
round
the
fire
playing
feasting
singing
ribald
songs
throwing
herbs
across
the
fire
gathering
herbs
at
noon
or
while
fasting
carrying
them
on
the
person
preserving
them
throughout
the
year
keeping
brands
or
cinders
of
the
fire
and
other
similar
practices
however
excellent
the
intentions
of
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
may
have
been
they
failed
of
effecting
their
purpose
for
the
superstitions
as
well
as
the
bonfires
survived
in
france
far
into
the
nineteenth
century
if
indeed
they
are
extinct
even
now
at
the
beginning
of
the
twentieth
writing
in
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
ch
cuissard
tells
us
that
he
himself
witnessed
in
touraine
and
poitou
the
superstitious
practices
which
he
describes
as
follows
the
most
credulous
examine
the
ways
in
which
the
flame
burns
and
draw
good
or
bad
omens
accordingly
others
after
leaping
through
the
flames
crosswise
pass
their
little
children
through
them
thrice
fully
persuaded
that
the
little
ones
will
then
be
able
to
walk
at
once
in
some
places
the
shepherds
make
their
sheep
tread
the
embers
of
the
extinct
fire
in
order
to
preserve
them
from
the
here
you
may
see
about
midnight
an
old
woman
grubbing
among
the
cinders
of
the
pyre
to
find
the
hair
of
the
holy
virgin
or
saint
john
which
she
deems
an
infallible
specific
against
fever
there
another
woman
is
busy
plucking
the
roots
of
the
herbs
which
have
been
burned
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
she
intends
to
eat
them
imagining
that
they
are
an
infallible
preservative
against
cancer
elsewhere
a
girl
wears
on
her
neck
a
flower
which
the
touch
of
john
s
fire
has
turned
for
her
into
a
talisman
and
she
is
sure
to
marry
within
the
year
shots
are
fired
at
the
tree
planted
in
the
midst
of
the
fire
to
drive
away
the
demons
who
might
purpose
to
send
sicknesses
about
the
country
seats
are
set
round
about
the
bonfire
in
order
that
the
souls
of
dead
relations
may
come
and
enjoy
themselves
for
a
little
with
the
in
brittany
apparently
the
custom
of
the
midsummer
bonfires
is
kept
up
to
this
day
thus
in
lower
brittany
every
town
and
every
village
still
lights
its
or
bonfire
on
john
s
night
when
the
flames
have
died
down
the
whole
assembly
kneels
round
about
the
bonfire
and
an
old
man
prays
aloud
then
they
all
rise
and
march
thrice
round
the
fire
at
the
third
turn
they
stop
and
every
one
picks
up
a
pebble
and
throws
it
on
the
burning
pile
after
that
they
disperse
in
finistère
the
bonfires
of
john
s
day
are
kindled
by
preference
in
an
open
space
near
a
chapel
of
john
but
if
there
is
no
such
chapel
they
are
lighted
in
the
square
facing
the
parish
church
and
in
some
districts
at
everybody
brings
fuel
for
the
fire
it
may
be
a
faggot
a
log
a
branch
or
an
armful
of
gorse
when
the
vespers
are
over
the
parish
priest
sets
a
light
to
the
pile
all
heads
are
bared
prayers
recited
and
hymns
sung
then
the
dancing
begins
the
young
folk
skip
round
the
blazing
pile
and
leap
over
it
when
the
flames
have
died
down
if
anybody
makes
a
false
step
and
falls
or
rolls
in
the
hot
embers
he
or
she
is
greeted
with
hoots
and
retires
abashed
from
the
circle
of
dancers
brands
are
carried
home
from
the
bonfire
to
protect
the
houses
against
lightning
conflagrations
and
certain
maladies
and
spells
the
precious
talisman
is
carefully
kept
in
a
cupboard
till
john
s
day
of
the
following
year
at
quimper
and
in
the
district
of
léon
chairs
used
to
be
placed
round
the
midsummer
bonfire
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
might
sit
on
them
and
warm
themselves
at
the
blaze
at
brest
on
this
day
thousands
of
people
used
to
assemble
on
the
ramparts
towards
evening
and
brandish
lighted
torches
which
they
swung
in
circles
or
flung
by
hundreds
into
the
air
the
closing
of
the
town
gates
put
an
end
to
the
spectacle
and
the
lights
might
be
seen
dispersing
in
all
directions
like
wandering
in
upper
brittany
the
materials
for
the
midsummer
bonfires
which
generally
consist
of
bundles
of
furze
and
heath
are
furnished
by
voluntary
contributions
and
piled
on
the
tops
of
hills
round
poles
each
of
which
is
surmounted
by
a
nosegay

a
crown
this
nosegay

crown
is
generally
provided
by
a
man
named
john

a
woman
named
jean
and
it
is
always
a
john
or
a
jean
who
puts
a
light
to
the
bonfire
while
the
fire
is
blazing
the
people
dance
and
sing
round
it
and
when
the
flames
have
subsided
they
leap
over
the
glowing
embers
charred
sticks
from
the
bonfire
are
thrown
into
wells
to
improve
the
water
and
they
are
also
taken
home
as
a
protection
against
thunder
to
make
them
thoroughly
effective
however
against
thunder
and
lightning
you
should
keep
them
near
your
bed
between
a
bit
of
a

fire
are
accounted
charms
against
disease
and
pain
both
bodily
and
spiritual
hence
girls
hang
them
at
their
breast
by
a
thread
of
scarlet
wool
in
many
parishes
of
brittany
the
priest
used
to
go
in
procession
with
the
crucifix
and
kindle
the
bonfire
with
his
own
hands
and
farmers
were
wont
to
drive
their
flocks
and
herds
through
the
fire
in
order
to
preserve
them
from
sickness
till
midsummer
of
the
following
year
also
it
was
believed
that
every
girl
who
danced
round
nine
of
the
bonfires
would
marry
within
the
year
in
normandy
the
midsummer
fires
have
now
almost
disappeared
at
least
in
the
district
known
as
the
bocage
but
they
used
to
shine
on
every
hill
they
were
commonly
made
by
piling
brushwood
broom
and
ferns
about
a
tall
tree
which
was
decorated
with
a
crown
of
moss
and
sometimes
with
flowers
while
they
burned
people
danced
and
sang
round
them
and
young
folk
leaped
over
the
flames
or
the
glowing
ashes
in
the
valley
of
the
orne
the
custom
was
to
kindle
the
bonfire
just
at
the
moment
when
the
sun
was
about
to
dip
below
the
horizon
and
the
peasants
drove
their
cattle
through
the
fires
to
protect
them
against
witchcraft
especially
against
the
spells
of
witches
and
wizards
who
attempted
to
steal
the
milk
and
butter
at
jumièges
in
normandy
down
to
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
midsummer
festival
was
marked
by
certain
singular
features
which
bore
the
stamp
of
a
very
high
antiquity
every
year
on
the
of
june
the
eve
of
john
the
brotherhood
of
the
green
wolf
chose
a
new
chief
or
master
who
had
always
to
be
taken
from
the
hamlet
of
conihout
on
being
elected
the
new
head
of
the
brotherhood
assumed
the
title
of
the
green
wolf
and
donned
a
peculiar
costume
consisting
of
a
long
green
mantle
and
a
very
tall
green
hat
of
a
conical
shape
and
without
a
brim
thus
arrayed
he
stalked
solemnly
at
the
head
of
the
brothers
chanting
the
hymn
of
john
the
crucifix
and
holy
banner
leading
the
way
to
a
place
called
chouquet
here
the
procession
was
met
by
the
priest
precentors
and
choir
who
conducted
the
brotherhood
to
the
parish
church
after
hearing
mass
the
company
adjourned
to
the
house
of
the
green
wolf
where
a
simple
repast
such
as
is
required
by
the
church
on
was
served
up
to
them
then
they
danced
before
the
door
till
it
was
time
to
light
the
bonfire
night
being
come
the
fire
was
kindled
to
the
sound
of
by
a
young
man
and
a
young
woman
both
decked
with
flowers
as
the
flames
rose
the
was
sung
and
a
villager
thundered
out
a
parody
in
the
norman
dialect
of
the
hymn
queant
meantime
the
green
wolf
and
his
brothers
with
their
hoods
down
on
their
shoulders
and
holding
each
other
by
the
hand
ran
round
the
fire
after
the
man
who
had
been
chosen
to
be
the
green
wolf
of
the
following
year
though
only
the
first
and
the
last
man
of
the
chain
had
a
hand
free
their
business
was
to
surround
and
seize
thrice
the
future
green
wolf
who
in
his
efforts
to
escape
belaboured
the
brothers
with
a
long
wand
which
he
carried
when
at
last
they
succeeded
in
catching
him
they
carried
him
to
the
burning
pile
and
made
as
if
they
would
throw
him
on
it
this
ceremony
over
they
returned
to
the
house
of
the
green
wolf
where
a
supper
still
of
the
most
meagre
fare
was
set
before
them
up
till
midnight
a
sort
of
religious
solemnity
prevailed
no
unbecoming
word
might
fall
from
the
lips
of
any
of
the
company
and
a
censor
armed
with
a
was
appointed
to
mark
and
punish
instantly
any
infraction
of
the
rule
but
at
the
stroke
of
twelve
all
this
was
changed
constraint
gave
way
to
license
pious
hymns
were
replaced
by
bacchanalian
ditties
and
the
shrill
quavering
notes
of
the
village
fiddle
hardly
rose
above
the
roar
of
voices
that
went
up
from
the
merry
brotherhood
of
the
green
wolf
next
day
the
of
june
or
midsummer
day
was
celebrated
by
the
same
personages
with
the
same
noisy
gaiety
one
of
the
ceremonies
consisted
in
parading
to
the
sound
of
musketry
an
enormous
loaf
of
consecrated
bread
which
rising
in
tiers
was
surmounted
by
a
pyramid
of
verdure
adorned
with
ribbons
after
that
the
holy
deposited
on
the
step
of
the
altar
were
entrusted
as
insignia
of
office
to
the
man
who
was
to
be
the
green
wolf
next
year
in
the
canton
of
breteuil
in
picardy
department
of
oise
the
priest
used
to
kindle
the
midsummer
bonfire
and
the
people
marched
thrice
round
it
in
procession
some
of
them
took
ashes
of
the
fire
home
with
them
to
protect
the
houses
against
lightning
the
custom
is
or
was
down
to
recent
years
similar

enormous
pyre

fire
the

preserve
the
charred
sticks

cinders
throughout

relics
of

bonfire
have
power
to
guard
them

from
contagious
diseases

the
custom
of
lighting
bonfires
and
dancing
round
them
at
the
midsummer
festival
of
john
lasted
down
to
about
the
fires
were
kindled
especially
when
june
had
been
rainy
and
the
people
thought
that
the
lighting
of

bonfires
would
cause
the
rain
to
cease
in
beauce
and
perche
two
neighbouring
districts
of
france

the
midsummer
bonfires
have
nearly
or
wholly
disappeared
but
formerly
they
were
commonly
kindled
and
went
by
the
name
of
the
fires
of
the
site
of
the
bonfire

either
the

a

of
faggots
brushwood
and
grass
was
accumulated
about
a
huge
branch
which
bore
at
the
top
a
crown
of
fresh
flowers
the

blessed
the
bonfire
and
the
people
danced
round
it
when

thrust
their
heads
into
the
puffs
of
smoke
in
the
belief
that
it
would
preserve
them
from
a
multitude
of
ills
and
when
the
fire
was
burnt
out
they
rushed
upon

home

some
of

farmers
in

days
not

with

public
bonfire
used
to
light
little
private
bonfires
in

farmyards
and
make
all
their
cattle
pass
through
the
smoke
and
flames
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
them
against
witchcraft
or
disease
in

every
one
was

bonfire
and
the
clergy
marched
at
the
head
of
the
procession
to
kindle
it
failure
to
light
the
fires
would
in
the
popular
belief
have
exposed

greatest
danger

they
were
lit
on
the
most
conspicuous
points
of
the
landscape
near
jean
in
the

it
appears
that
at
this
season
young
people
still
repair
to
the
and
heights
and
there
wave
burning
torches
so
as
to
present

in
the
darkness
in
the
province
of
france
which

immediately
to

west
of

mountains
the
fires
of
john
still
shone
on
the
saint
s
day
in
several
villages
down
to
recent
years
they
were
generally
lit
on
high
ground
and
the
young
folks
of
both
sexes
sang
and
danced
round
them
and
sprang
over
the
dying
flames
in
bresse
bonfires
used
to
be
kindled
on
midsummer
eve
the
of
june
and
the
people
danced
about
them
in
a
circle
devout
persons
particularly
old
women
circumambulated
the
fires
fourteen
times
telling
their
beads
and
mumbling
seven
and
seven
in
the
hope
that
thereby
they
would
feel
no
pains
in
their
backs
when
they
stooped
over
the
sickle
in
the
harvest
field
in
berry
a
district
of
central
france
the
midsummer
fire
was
lit
on
the
eve
of
john
and
went
by
the
name
of
the
or
every
family
according
to
its
means
contributed
faggots
which
were
piled
round
a
pole
on
the
highest
ground
in
the
neighbourhood
in
the
hamlets
the
office
of
kindling
the
fire
devolved
on
the
oldest
man
but
in
the
towns
it
was
the
priest
or
the
mayor
who
discharged
the
duty
here
as
in
brittany
people
supposed
that
a
girl
who
had
danced
round
nine
of
the
midsummer
bonfires
would
marry
within
the
year
to
leap
several
times
over
the
fire
was
regarded
as
a
sort
of
purification
which
kept
off
sickness
and
brought
good
luck
to
the
leaper
hence
the
nimble
youth
bounded
through
the
smoke
and
flames
and
when
the
fire
had
somewhat
abated
parents
jumped
across
it
with
their
children
in
their
arms
in
order
that
the
little
ones
might
also
partake
of
its
beneficent
influence
embers
from
the
extinct
bonfire
were
taken
home
and
after
being
dipped
in
holy
water
were
kept
as
a
talisman
against
all
kinds
of
misfortune
but
especially
against
lightning
the
same
virtue
was
ascribed
to
the
ashes
and
charred
sticks
of
the
midsummer
bonfire
in
périgord
where
everybody
contributed
his
share
of
fuel
to
the
pile
and
the
whole
was
crowned
with
flowers
especially
with
roses
and
lilies
on
the
borders
of
the
departments
of
creuse
and
corrèze
in
central
france
the
fires
of
john
used
to
be
lit
on
the
eve
of
the
saint
s
day
the
of
june
the
custom
seems
to
have
survived
till
towards
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
men
women
and
children
assembled
round
the
fires
and
the
young
people
jumped
over
them
children
were
brought
by
their
parents
or
elder
brothers
into
contact
with
the
flames
in
the
belief
that
this
would
save
them
from
fever
older
people
girded
themselves
with
stalks
of
rye
taken
from
a
neighbouring
field
because
they
fancied
that
by
so
doing
they
would
not
grow
weary
in
reaping
the
corn
at
harvest
bonfires
were
lit
in
almost
all
the
hamlets
of
poitou
on
the
eve
of
john
people
marched
round
them
thrice
carrying
a
branch
of
walnut
in
their
hand
shepherdesses
and
children
passed
sprigs
of
mullein
and
nuts
across
the
flames
the
nuts
were
supposed
to
cure
toothache
and
the
mullein
to
protect
the
cattle
from
sickness
and
sorcery
when
the
fire
died
down
people
took
some
of
the
ashes
home
with
them
either
to
keep
them
in
the
house
as
a
preservative
against
thunder
or
to
scatter
them
on
the
fields
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
and
darnel
stones
were
also
placed
round
the
fire
and
it
was
believed
that
the
first
to
lift
one
of
these
stones
next
morning
would
find
under
it
the
hair
of
st
john
in
poitou
also
it
used
to
be
customary
on
the
eve
of
john
to
trundle
a
blazing
wheel
wrapt
in
straw
over
the
fields
to
fertilize
them
this
last
custom
is
said
to
be
now
extinct
but
it
is
still
usual
or
was
so
down
to
recent
years
in
poitou
to
kindle
fires
on
this
day
at
or
on
the
heights
the
oldest
or
youngest
person
present
sets
a
light
to
the
pile
which
consists
of
broom
gorse
and
heath
a
bright
and
crackling
blaze
shoots
up
but
soon
dies
down
and
over
it
the
young
folk
leap
they
also
throw
stones
into
it
picking
the
stone
according
to
the
size
of
the
turnips
that
they
wish
to
have
that
year
it
is
said
that
the
good
virgin
comes
and
sits
on
the
prettiest
of
the
stones
and
next
morning
they
see
there
her
beautiful
golden
tresses
at
lussac
in
poitou
the
lighting
of
the
midsummer
bonfire
is
still
an
affair
of
some
ceremony
a
pyramid
of
faggots
is
piled
round
a
tree
or
tall
pole
on
the
ground
where
the
fair
is
held
the
priest
goes
in
procession
to
the
spot
and
kindles
the
pile
when
prayers
have
been
said
and
the
clergy
have
withdrawn
the
people
continue
to
march
round
the
fire
telling
their
beads
but
it
is
not
till
the
flames
have
begun
to
die
down
that
the
youth
jump
over
them
a
brand
from
the
midsummer
bonfire
is
supposed
to
be
a
preservative
against
thunder
in
the
department
of
vienne
the
bonfire
was
kindled
by
the
oldest
man
and
before
the
dance
round
the
flames
began
it
was
the
custom
to
pass
across
them
a
great
bunch
of
mullein
and
a
branch
of
walnut
which
next
morning
before
sunrise
were
fastened
over
the
door
of
the
chief
a
similar
custom
prevailed
in
the
neighbouring
department
of
but
here
it
was
the
priest
who
kindled
the
bonfire
and
old
men
used
to
put
embers
of
the
fire
in
their
wooden
shoes
as
a
preservative
against
many
evils
in
some
towns
and
villages
of
saintonge
and
aunis
provinces
of
western
france
now
mostly
comprised
in
the
department
of
charente
inférieure
the
fires
of
john
are
still
kindled
on
midsummer
eve
but
the
custom
is
neither
so
common
nor
carried
out
with
so
much
pomp
and
ceremony
as
formerly
great
quantities
of
wood
used
to
be
piled
on
an
open
space
round
about
a
huge
post
or
a
tree
stripped
of
its
leaves
and
branches
every
one
took
care
to
contribute
a
faggot
to
the
pile
and
the
whole
population
marched
to
the
spot
in
procession
with
the
crucifix
at
their
head
and
the
priest
bringing
up
the
rear
the
squire
or
other
person
of
high
degree
put
the
torch
to
the
pyre
and
the
priest
blessed
it
in
the
southern
and
eastern
parts
of
saintonge
children
and
cattle
were
passed
through
the
smoke
of
the
bonfires
to
preserve
them
from
contagious
diseases
and
when
the
fire
had
gone
out
the
people
scuffled
for
the
charred
fragments
of
the
great
post
which
they
regarded
as
talismans
against
thunder
next
morning
on
midsummer
day
every
shepherdess
in
the
neighbourhood
was
up
very
early
for
the
first
to
drive
her
sheep
over
the
blackened
cinders
and
ashes
of
the
great
bonfire
was
sure
to
have
the
best
flock
all
that
year
where
the
shepherds
shrunk
from
driving
their
flocks
through
the
smoke
and
flames

contented
themselves
with
marking
the
of

the
ashes
in
the
mountainous
part
of
comminges
a
province
of
southern
france
now
comprised
in
the
department
of
haute

the
midsummer
fire
is
made
by
splitting
open
the
trunk
of
a
tall
tree
stuffing
the
crevice
with
shavings
and
igniting
the
whole
a
garland
of
flowers

fastened
to
the
top
of
the
tree
and
at
the
moment
when
the
fire
is
lighted
the
man
who
was
last
married
has
to
climb
up
a
ladder
and
bring
the
flowers
down
in
the
flat

of
the

the
materials
of
the
midsummer
bonfires
consist
of
fuel
piled
in
the
usual
way
but
they
must
be
put
together
by
men
who
have
been
married
since
the
last
midsummer
festival
and
each
of
these
benedicts
is
obliged
to
lay
a
wreath
of
flowers

of
the
pile

the
entrance
of

up
on
the
banks
of

garonne
a
tree
covered
with
ribbons
and
garlands
at
the
end
of
a
year
the
withered
tree
and
faded
flowers
furnish
excellent
fuel
so
on
the
eve
of
john
the
villagers
assemble
and
an
old
man
or
a
child
kindles
the
fire
which
is
to
consume
tree
and
garlands
together
while
the
blaze
lasts
the
people
sing
and
dance
and
the
burnt
tree
is
then
replaced
by
another
which
will
suffer
the
same
fate
after
the
lapse
of
a
year
in
some
districts
of
the
french
pyrenees
it
is
deemed
necessary
to
leap
nine
times
over
the
midsummer
fire
if
you
would
be
assured
of
prosperity
a
traveller
in
southern
france
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
tells
us
that
the
eve
of
john
is
also
a
day
of
joy
for
the
provençals
they
light
great
fires
and
the
young
folk
leap
over
them
at
aix
they
shower
squibs
and
crackers
on
the
which
has
often
had
disagreeable
consequences
at
marseilles
they
drench
each
other
with
scented
water
which
is
poured
from
the
windows
or
squirted
from
little
syringes
the
roughest
jest
is
to
souse
with
clean
water
which
gives
rise
to
loud
bursts
of
at
draguignan
in
the
department
of
var
fires
used
to
be
lit
in
every
street
on
the
eve
of
john
and
the
people
roasted
pods
of
garlic
at
them
the
pods
were
afterwards
distributed
to
every
family
another
diversion
of
the
evening
was
to
pour
cans
of
water
from
the
houses
on
the
heads
of
people
in
the
streets
in
provence
the
midsummer
fires
are
still
popular
children
go
from
door
to
door
begging
for
fuel
and
they
are
seldom
sent
empty
away
formerly
the
priest
the
mayor
and
the
aldermen
used
to
walk
in
procession
to
the
bonfire
and
even
deigned
to
light
it
after
which
the
assembly
marched
thrice
round
the
burning
pile
while
the
church
bells
pealed
and
rockets
fizzed
and
sputtered
in
the
air
dancing
began
later
and
the
bystanders
threw
water
on
each
other
at
ciotat
while
the
fire
was
blazing
the
young
people
plunged
into
the
sea
and
splashed
each
other
vigorously
at
vitrolles
they
bathed
in
a
pond
in
order
that
they
might
not
suffer
from
fever
during
the
year
and
at
they
watered
the
horses
to
protect
them
from
the
itch
at
aix
a
nominal
king
chosen
from
among
the
youth
for
his
skill
in
shooting
at
a
popinjay
presided
over
the
festival
he
selected
his
own
officers
and
escorted
by
a
brilliant
train
marched
to
the
bonfire
kindled
it
and
was
the
first
to
dance
round
it
next
day
he
distributed
largesse
to
his
followers
his
reign
lasted
a
year
during
which
he
enjoyed
certain
privileges
he
was
allowed
to
attend
the
mass
celebrated
by
the
commander
of
the
knights
of
john
on
john
s
day
the
right
of
hunting
was
accorded
to
him
and
soldiers
might
not
be
quartered
in
his
house
at
marseilles
also
on
this
day
one
of
the
guilds
chose
a
king
of
the
or
double
axe
but
it
does
not
appear
that
he
kindled
the
bonfire
which
is
said
to
have
been
lighted
with
great
ceremony
by
the
préfet
and
other
authorities
in
belgium
the
custom
of
kindling
the
midsummer
bonfires
has
long
disappeared
from
the
great
cities
but
it
is
still
kept
up
in
rural
districts
and
small
towns
of
brabant
flanders
and
limburg
people
leap
across
the
fires
to
protect
themselves
against
fever
and
in
eastern
flanders
women
perform
similar
leaps
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
an
easy
delivery
at
termonde
young
people
go
from
door
to
door
collecting
fuel
for
the
fires
and
reciting
verses
in
which
they
beg
the
inmates
to
give
them
wood
of
john
and
to
keep
some
wood
for
peter
s
day
the
of
june
for
in
belgium
the
eve
of
peter
s
day
is
celebrated
by
bonfires
and
dances
exactly
like
those
which
commemorate
john
s
eve
the
ashes
of
the
john
s
fires
are
deemed
by
belgian
peasants
an
excellent
remedy
for
consumption
if
you
take
a
spoonful
or
two
of
them
moistened
with
water
day
by
day
people
also
burn
vervain
in
the
fires
and
they
say
that
in
the
ashes
of
the
plant
you
may
find
if
you
look
for
it
the
fool
s
in
many
parts
of
brabant
peter
s
bonfire
used
to
be
much
larger
than
that
of
his
rival
john
when
it
had
burned
out
both
sexes
engaged
in
a
game
of
ball
and
the
winner
became
the
king
of
summer
or
of
the
ball
and
had
the
right
to
choose
his
queen
sometimes
the
winner
was
a
woman
and
it
was
then
her
privilege
to
select
her
royal
mate
this
pastime
was
well
known
at
louvain
and
it
continued
to
be
practised
at
grammont
and
mespelaer
down
to
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
at
mespelaer
which
is
a
village
near
termonde
a
huge
pile
of
eglantine
reeds
and
straw
was
collected
in
a
marshy
meadow
for
the
bonfire
and
next
evening
after
vespers
the
young
folk
who
had
lit
it
assembled
at
the
good
life
tavern
to
play
the
game
the
winner
was
crowned
with
a
wreath
of
roses
and
the
rest
danced
and
sang
in
a
ring
about
him
at
grammont
while
the
bonfire
was
lit
and
the
dances
round
it
took
place
on
peter
s
eve
the
festival
of
the
crown
of
roses
was
deferred
till
the
following
sunday
the
young
folk
arranged
among
themselves
beforehand
who
should
be
king
and
queen
of
the
roses
the
rosy
wreaths
were
hung
on
cords
across
the
street
the
dancers
danced
below
them
and
at
a
given
moment
the
wreaths
fell
on
the
heads
of
the
chosen
king
and
queen
who
had
to
entertain
their
fellows
at
a
feast
according
to
some
people
the
fires
of
peter
like
those
of
john
were
lighted
in
order
to
drive
away
dragons
in
french
flanders
down
to
a
straw
figure
representing
a
man
was
always
burned
in
the
midsummer
bonfire
and
the
figure
of
a
woman
was
burned
on
peter
s
day
in
belgium
people
jump
over
the
midsummer
bonfires
as
a
preventive
of
colic
and
they
keep
the
ashes
at
home
to
hinder
fire
from
breaking
out
the
custom
of
lighting
bonfires
at
midsummer
has
been
observed
in
many
parts
of
our
own
country
on
the
vigil
of
saint
john
the
baptist
commonly
called
midsummer
eve
it
was
usual
in
most
country
places
and
also
in
towns
and
cities
for
the
inhabitants
both
old
and
young
and
of
both
sexes
to
meet
together
and
make
merry
by
the
side
of
a
large
fire
made
in
the
middle
of
the
street
or
in
some
open
and
convenient
place
over
which
the
young
men
frequently
leaped
by
way
of
frolic
and
also
exercised
themselves
with
various
sports
and
pastimes
more
especially
with
running
wrestling
and
dancing
these
diversions
they
continued
till
midnight
and
sometimes
till
in
the
streets
of
london
the
midsummer
fires
were
lighted
in
the
time
of
queen
elizabeth
down
to
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
as
we
learn
from
stow
s
description
which
runs
thus
in
the
months
of
june
and
july
on
the
vigils
of
festival
days
and
on
the
same
festival
days
in
the
evenings
after
the
sun
setting
there
were
usually
made
bonfires
in
the
streets
every
man
bestowing
wood
or
labour
towards
them
the
wealthier
sort
also
before
their
doors
near
to
the
said
bonfires
would
set
out
tables
on
the
vigils
furnished
with
sweet
bread
and
good
drink
and
on
the
festival
days
with
meats
and
drinks
plentifully
whereunto
they
would
invite
their
neighbours
and
passengers
also
to
sit
and
be
merry
with
them
in
great
familiarity
praising
god
for
his
benefits
bestowed
on
them
these
were
called
bonfires
as
well
of
good
amity
amongst
neighbours
that
being
before
at
controversy
were
there
by
the
labour
of
others
reconciled
and
made
of
bitter
enemies
loving
friends
and
also
for
the
virtue
that
a
great
fire
hath
to
purge
the
infection
of
the
air
on
the
vigil
of
john
the
baptist
and
on
peter
and
paul
the
apostles
every
man
s
door
being
shadowed
with
green
birch
long
fennel
john
s
wort
orpin
white
lilies
and
such
like
garnished
upon
with
garlands
of
beautiful
flowers
had
also
lamps
of
glass
with
oil
burning
in
them
all
the
night
some
hung
out
branches
of
iron
curiously
wrought
containing
hundreds
of
lamps
alight
at
once
which
made
a
goodly
show
namely
in
new
fish
street
thames
street
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
eton
boys
used
to
kindle
a
bonfire
on
the
east
side
of
the
church
both
on
john
s
day
and
on
peter
s
day
writing
in
the
second
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
antiquary
john
aubrey
tells
us
that
bonfires
were
still
kindled
in
many
places
on
john
s
night
but
that
the
civil
wars
had
thrown
many
of
these
old
customs
out
of
fashion
wars
he
adds
extinguish
superstition
as
well
as
religion
and
laws
and
there
is
nothing
like
gunpowder
for
putting
phantoms
to
flight
in
the
north
of
england
these
fires
used
to
be
lit
in
the
open
streets
young
and
old
gathered
round
them
and
while
the
young
leaped
over
the
fires
and
engaged
in
games
their
elders
looked
on
and
probably
remembered
with
regret
the
days
when
they
used
to
foot
it
as
nimbly
sometimes
the
fires
were
kindled
on
the
tops
of
high
hills
the
people
also
carried
firebrands
about
the
fields
the
custom
of
kindling
bonfires
on
midsummer
eve
prevailed
all
over
cumberland
down
to
the
second
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
northumberland
the
custom
seems
to
have
lasted
into
the
first
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
fires
were
lit
in
the
villages
and
on
the
tops
of
high
hills
and
the
people
sported
and
danced
round
them
moreover
the
villagers
used
to
run
with
burning
brands
round
their
fields
and
to
snatch
ashes
from
a
neighbour
s
fire
saying
as
they
did
so
we
have
the
flower
or
flour
of
the
at
sandhill
bonfires
were
kindled
on
the
eve
of
peter
as
well
as
on
midsummer
eve
the
custom
is
attested
for
the
year
when
it
was
described
as
ancient
we
are
told
that
on
midsummer
s
eve
reckoned
according
to
the
old
style
it
was
formerly
the
custom
of
the
inhabitants
young
and
old
not
only
of
whalton
but
of
most
of
the
adjacent
villages
to
collect
a
large
cartload
of
whins
and
other
combustible
materials
which
was
dragged
by
them
with
great
rejoicing
a
fiddler
being
seated
on
the
top
of
the
cart
into
the
village
and
erected
into
a
pile
the
people
from
the
surrounding
country
assembled
towards
evening
when
it
was
set
on
fire
and
whilst
the
young
danced
around
it
the
elders
looked
on
smoking
their
pipes
and
drinking
their
beer
until
it
was
consumed
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
this
curious
old
custom
dates
from
a
very
remote
in
a
which
was
tried
in
the
rector
of
whalton
gave
evidence
of
the
constant
use
of
the
village
green
for
the
ceremony
since
the
bonfire
he
said
was
lighted
a
little
to
the
of
the
well
at
whalton
and
partly
on
the
footpath
and
people
danced
round
it
and
jumped
through
it
that
was
never
the
rev
hall
writing
in
says
that
the
fire
festivals
or
bonfires
of
the
summer
solstice
at
the
old
midsummer
until
recently
were
commemorated
on
christenburg
crags
and
elsewhere
by
leaping
through
and
dancing
round
the
fires
as
those
who
have
been
present
have
told
down
to
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
bonfires
called
used
to
be
lit
on
midsummer
eve
all
over
the
wolds
in
the
east
riding
of
yorkshire
in
herefordshire
and
somersetshire
the
peasants
used
to
make
fires
in
the
fields
on
midsummer
eve
to
bless
the
in
devonshire
the
custom
of
leaping
over
the
midsummer
fires
was
also
observed
in
cornwall
the
festival
fires
called
bonfires
are
kindled
on
the
eves
of
john
baptist
and
peter
s
day
and
midsummer
is
thence
in
the
cornish
tongue
called
which
signifies
both
light
and
rejoicing
at
these
fires
the
cornish
attend
with
lighted
torches
tarred
and
pitched
at
the
end
and
make
their
perambulations
round
their
fires
going
from
village
to
village
and
carrying
their
torches
before
them
this
is
certainly
the
remains
of
druid
superstition
for
to
carry
lighted
torches
was
reckoned
a
kind
of
gentilism
and
as
such
particularly
prohibited
by
the
gallick
at
penzance
and
elsewhere
in
the
county
the
people
danced
and
sang
about
the
bonfires
on
midsummer
eve
on
whiteborough
a
large
tumulus
near
launceston
a
huge
bonfire
used
to
be
kindled
on
midsummer
eve
a
tall
summer
pole
with
a
large
bush
at
the
top
was
fixed
in
the
centre
of
the
bonfire
the
cornish
fires
at
this
season
appear
to
have
been
commonly
lit
on
high
and
conspicuous
hills
such
as
tregonan
godolphin
carnwarth
and
carn
brea
when
it
grew
dusk
on
midsummer
eve
old
men
would
hobble
away
to
some
height
whence
they
counted
the
fires
and
drew
a
presage
from
their
number
it
is
the
immemorial
usage
in
penzance
and
the
neighbouring
towns
and
villages
to
kindle
bonfires
and
torches
on
and
on
to
hold
a
fair
on
penzance
quay
where
the
country
folks
assemble
from
the
adjoining
parishes
in
great
numbers
to
make
excursions
on
the
water
peter
s
eve
the
of
june
is
distinguished
by
a
similar
display
of
bonfires
and
torches
although
the
on

the
of

has
been
discontinued
upwards
of
forty
years
on
these
eves
a
line
of
relieved
occasionally
by
large
bonfires
is
seen
in
the
centre
of
each
of
the
principal
streets
in
penzance
on
either
side
of
this
line
young
men
and
women
pass
up
and
down
swinging
round
their
heads
heavy
torches
made
of
large
pieces
of
folded
canvas
steeped
in
tar
and
nailed
to

fixed
outside

along

the

mimicking
their

bore
rows
of
holes
in

load
them
with
gunpowder
and
explode
them
in
rapid
succession
by

not
equal
to
what

when
the

wreaths
of
custom
in
all
probability
originating
from
the
ancient
use
of
these
ornaments
when
they
danced
around
the
fires
at
the
close
of
the
fireworks
in
penzance
a
great
number
of
persons
of
both
sexes
chiefly
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
quay
used
always
until
within
the
last
few
years
to
join
hand
in
hand
forming
a
long
string
and
run
through
the
streets
playing

the
needle
heedless
of
the
fireworks
showered
upon
them
and
oftentimes
leaping
over
the
yet
glowing
embers
i
have
on
these
occasions
seen
boys
following
one
another
jumping
through
flames
higher
than
in
wales
the
midsummer
fires
were
kindled
on
john
s
eve
and
on
john
s
day
three
or
nine
different
kinds
of
wood
and
charred
faggots
carefully
preserved
from
the
last
midsummer
were
deemed
necessary
to
build
the
bonfire
which
was
generally
done
on
rising
ground
various
herbs
were
thrown
into
the
blaze
and
girls
with
bunches
of
three
or
nine
different
kinds
of
flowers
would
take
the
hands
of
boys
who
wore
flowers
in
their
buttonholes
and
hats
and
together
the
young
couples
would
leap
over
the
fires
on
the
same
two
midsummer
days
roses
and
wreaths
of
flowers
were
hung
over
the
doors
and
windows
describing
a
midsummer
fire
an
old
inhabitant
born
in
remembered
being
taken
to
different
hills
in
the
vale
of
glamorgan
to
see
festivities
in
which
people
from
all
parts
of
the
district
participated
she
was
at
that
time
about
fourteen
and
old
enough
to
retain
a
vivid
recollection
of
the
circumstances
people
conveyed
trusses
of
straw
to
the
top
of
the
hill
where
men
and
youths
waited
for
the
contributions
women
and
girls
were
stationed
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
then
a
large
was
thickly
swathed
with
straw
and
not
an
inch
of
wood
was
left
in
sight
a
pole
was
inserted
through
the
centre
of
the
wheel
so
that
long
ends
extended
about
a
yard
on
each
side
if
any
straw
remained
it
was
made
up
into
torches
at
the
top
of
tall
sticks
at
a
given
signal
the
wheel
was
lighted
and
sent
rolling
downhill
if
this
went
out
before
it
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
a
very
poor
harvest
was
promised
if
it
kept
lighted
all
the
way
down
and
continued
blazing
for
a
long
time
the
harvest
would
be
exceptionally
abundant
loud
cheers
and
shouts
accompanied
the
progress
of
the
at
darowen
in
wales
small
bonfires
were
kindled
on
midsummer
eve
on
the
same
day
people
in
the
isle
of
man
were
wont
to
light
fires
to
the
windward
of
every
field
so
that
the
smoke
might
pass
over
the
corn
and
they
folded
their
cattle
and
carried
blazing
furze
or
gorse
round
them
several
times
a
writer
of
the
last
quarter
of
the
seventeenth
century
tells
us
that
in
ireland
on
the
eves
of
john
baptist
and
peter
they
always
have
in
every
town
a
bonfire
late
in
the
evenings
and
carry
about
bundles
of
reeds
fast
tied
and
fired
these
being
dry
will
last
long
and
flame
better
than
a
torch
and
be
a
pleasing
divertive
prospect
to
the
distant
beholder
a
stranger
would
go
near
to
imagine
the
whole
country
was
on
another
writer
says
of
the
south
of
ireland
on
midsummer
s
eve
every
eminence
near
which
is
a
habitation
blazes
with
bonfires
and
round
these
they
carry
numerous
torches
shouting
and
dancing
which
affords
a
beautiful
an
author
who
described
ireland
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
eighteenth
century
says
on
the
vigil
of
john
the
baptist
s
nativity
they
make
bonfires
and
run
along
the
streets
and
fields
with
wisps
of
straw
blazing
on
long
poles
to
purify
the
air
which
they
think
infectious
by
believing
all
the
devils
spirits
ghosts
and
hobgoblins
fly
abroad
this
night
to
hurt
another
writer
states
that
he
witnessed
the
festival
in
ireland
in
at
the
house
where
i
was
entertained
it
was
told
me
that
we
should
see
at
midnight
the
most
singular
sight
in
ireland
which
was
the
lighting
of
fires
in
honour
of
the
sun
accordingly
exactly
at
midnight
the
fires
began
to
appear
and
taking
the
advantage
of
going
up
to
the
leads
of
the
house
which
had
a
widely
extended
view
i
saw
on
a
radius
of
thirty
miles
all
around
the
fires
burning
on
every
eminence
which
the
country
afforded
i
had
a
farther
satisfaction
in
learning
from
undoubted
authority
that
the
people
danced
round
the
fires
and
at
the
close
went
through
these
fires
and
made
their
sons
and
daughters
together
with
their
cattle
pass
through
the
fire
and
the
whole
was
conducted
with
religious
that
the
custom
prevailed
in
full
force
as
late
as
appears
from
a
notice
in
a
newspaper
of
that
date
which
runs
thus
the
old
pagan
still
survives
in
ireland
though
nominally
in
honour
of
john
on
sunday
night
bonfires
were
observed
throughout
nearly
every
county
in
the
province
of
leinster
in
kilkenny
fires
blazed
on
every
hillside
at
intervals
of
about
a
mile
there
were
very
many
in
the
queen
s
county
also
in
kildare
and
wexford
the
effect
in
the
rich
sunset
appeared
to
travellers
very
grand
the
people
assemble
and
dance
round
the
fires
the
children
jump
through
the
flames
and
in
former
times
live
coals
were
carried
into
the
to
prevent
in
county
leitrim
on
john
s
eve
which
is
called
bonfire
day
fires
are
still
lighted
after
dusk
on
the
hills
and
along
the
sides
of
the
roads
all
over
kerry
the
same
thing
continues
to
be
done
though
not
so
commonly
as
of
old
small
fires
were
made
across
the
road
and
to
drive
through
them
brought
luck
for
the
year
cattle
were
also
driven
through
the
fires
on
lettermore
island
in
south
connemara
some
of
the
ashes
from
the
midsummer
bonfire
are
thrown
on
the
fields
to
fertilize
them
one
writer
informs
us
that
in
munster
and
connaught
a
bone
must
always
be
burned
in
the
fire
for
otherwise
the
people
believe
that
the
fire
will
bring
no
luck
he
adds
that
in
many
places
sterile
beasts
and
human
beings
are
passed
through
the
fire
and
that
as
a
boy
he
himself
jumped
through
the
fire
for
an
has
described
as
follows
a
remarkable
ceremony
observed
in
ireland
on
midsummer
eve
when
the
fire
burned
for
some
hours
and
got
low
an
indispensable
part
of
the
ceremony
commenced
every
one
present
of
the
peasantry
passed
through
it
and
several
children
were
thrown
across
the
sparkling
embers
while
a
wooden
frame
of
some
eight
feet
long
with
a
horse
s
head
fixed
to
one
end
and
a
large
white
sheet
thrown
over
it
concealing
the
wood
and
the
man
on
whose
head
it
was
carried
made
its
appearance
this
was
greeted
with
loud
shouts
of
the
white
horse
and
having
been
safely
carried
by
the
skill
of
its
bearer
several
times
through
the
fire
with
a
bold
leap
it
pursued
the
people
who
ran
screaming
and
laughing
in
every
direction
i
asked
what
the
horse
was
meant
for
and
was
told
that
it
represented
all
lady
wilde
s
account
of
the
midsummer
festival
in
ireland
is
picturesque
and
probably
correct
in
substance
although
she
does
not
cite
her
authorities
as
it
contains
some
interesting
features
which
are
not
noticed
by
the
other
writers
on
ireland
whom
i
have
consulted
i
will
quote
the
greater
part
of
it
in
full
in
ancient
times
she
says
the
sacred
fire
was
lighted
with
great
ceremony
on
midsummer
eve
and
on
that
night
all
the
people
of
the
adjacent
country
kept
fixed
watch
on
the
western
promontory
of
howth
and
the
moment
the
first
flash
was
seen
from
that
spot
the
fact
of
ignition
was
announced
with
wild
cries
and
cheers
repeated
from
village
to
village
when
all
the
local
fires
began
to
blaze
and
ireland
was
circled
by
a
cordon
of
flame
rising
up
from
every
hill
then
the
dance
and
song
began
round
every
fire
and
the
wild
hurrahs
filled
the
air
with
the
most
frantic
revelry
many
of
these
ancient
customs
are
still
continued
and
the
fires
are
still
lighted
on
john
s
eve
on
every
hill
in
ireland
when
the
fire
has
burned
down
to
a
red
glow
the
young
men
strip
to
the
waist
and
leap
over
or
through
the
flames
this
is
done
backwards
and
forwards
several
times
and
he
who
braves
the
greatest
blaze
is
considered
the
victor
over
the
powers
of
evil
and
is
greeted
with
tremendous
applause
when
the
fire
burns
still
lower
the
young
girls
leap
the
flame
and
those
who
leap
clean
over
three
times
back
and
forward
will
be
certain
of
a
speedy
marriage
and
good
luck
in
with
many
children
the
married
women
then
walk
through
the
lines
of
the
burning
embers
and
when
the
fire
is
nearly
burnt
and
trampled
down
the
yearling
cattle
are
driven
through
the
hot
ashes
and
their
back
is
singed
with
a
lighted
hazel
twig
these
rods
are
kept
safely
afterwards
being
considered
of
immense
power
to
drive
the
cattle
to
and
from
the
watering
places
as
the
fire
diminishes
the
shouting
grows
fainter
and
the
song
and
the
dance
commence
while
professional
narrate
tales
of
or
of
the
good
old
times
long
ago
when
the
kings
and
princes
of
ireland
dwelt
amongst
their
own
people
and
there
was
food
to
eat
and
wine
to
drink
for
all
comers
to
the
feast
at
the
king
s
house
when
the
crowd
at
length
separate
every
one
carries
home
a
brand
from
the
fire
and
great
virtue
is
attached
to
the
lighted
which
is
safely
carried
to
the
house
without
breaking
or
falling
to
the
ground
many
contests
also
arise
amongst
the
young
men
for
whoever
enters
his
house
first
with
the
sacred
fire
brings
the
good
luck
of
the
year
with
in
ireland
as
elsewhere
water
was
also
apparently
thought
to
acquire
a
certain
mystical
virtue
at
midsummer
at
stoole
near
downpatrick
there
is
a
ceremony
commencing
at
twelve
o
clock
at
night
on
midsummer
eve
its
sacred
mount
is
consecrated
to
patrick
the
plain
contains
three
wells
to
which
the
most
extraordinary
virtues
are
attributed
here
and
there
are
heaps
of
stones
around
some
of
which
appear
great
numbers
of
people
running
with
as
much
speed
as
possible
around
others
crowds
of
worshippers
kneel
with
bare
legs
and
feet
as
an
indispensable
part
of
the
penance
the
men
without
coats
with
handkerchiefs
on
their
heads
instead
of
hats
having
gone
seven
times
round
each
heap
kiss
the
ground
cross
themselves
and
proceed
to
the
hill
here
they
ascend
on
their
bare
knees
by
a
path
so
steep
and
rugged
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
walk
up
many
hold
their
hands
clasped
at
the
back
of
their
necks
and
several
carry
large
stones
on
their
heads
having
repeated
this
ceremony
seven
times
they
go
to
what
is
called
patrick
s
chair
which
are
two
great
flat
stones
fixed
upright
in
the
hill
here
they
cross
and
bless
themselves
as
they
step
in
between
these
stones
and
while
repeating
prayers
an
old
man
seated
for
the
purpose
turns
them
round
on
their
feet
three
times
for
which
he
is
paid
the
devotee
then
goes
to
conclude
his
penance
at
a
pile
of
stones
named
the
altar
while
this
busy
scene
is
continued
by
the
multitude
the
wells
and
streams
issuing
from
them
are
thronged
by
crowds
of
halt
maimed
and
blind
pressing
to
wash
away
their
infirmities
with
water
consecrated
by
their
patron
saint
and
so
powerful
is
the
impression
of
its
efficacy
on
their
minds
that
many
of
those
who
go
to
be
healed
and
who
are
not
totally
blind
or
altogether
crippled
really
believe
for
a
time
that
they
are
by
means
of
its
miraculous
virtues
perfectly
in
scotland
the
traces
of
midsummer
fires
are
few
we
are
told
by
a
writer
of
the
eighteenth
century
that
the
fire
a
relict
of
druidism
was
kindled
in
some
parts
of
the
county
of
perth
another
writer
of
the
same
period
describing
what
he
calls
the
druidical
festivals
of
the
highlanders
says
that
the
least
considerable
of
them
is
that
of
midsummer
in
the
highlands
of
perthshire
there
are
some
vestiges
of
it
the
cowherd
goes
three
times
round
the
fold
according
to
the
course
of
the
sun
with
a
burning
torch
in
his
hand
they
imagined
this
rite
had
a
tendency
to
purify
their
herds
and
flocks
and
to
prevent
diseases
at
their
return
the
landlady
makes
an
entertainment
for
the
cowherd
and
his
in
the
of
scotland
down
to
the
latter
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
farmers
used
to
go
round
their
lands
with
burning
torches
about
the
middle
of
june
on
the
hill
of
cairnshee
in
the
parish
of
durris
kincardineshire
the
herdsmen
of
the
country
round
about
annually
kindle
a
bonfire
at
sunset
on
midsummer
day
the
of
june
the
men
or
lads
collect
the
fuel
and
push
each
other
through
the
smoke
and
flames
the
custom
is
kept
up
through
the
benefaction
of
a
certain
alexander
hogg
a
native
of
the
parish
who
died
about
and
left
a
small
sum
for
the
maintenance
of
a
midsummer
bonfire
on
the
spot
because
as
a
boy
he
had
herded
cattle
on
the
hill
we
may
conjecture
that
in
doing
so
he
merely
provided
for
the
continuance
of
an
old
custom
which
he
himself
had
observed
in
the
same
place
in
his
youth
at
the
village
of
tarbolton
in
ayrshire
a
bonfire
has
been
annually
kindled
from
time
immemorial
on
the
evening
of
the
first
monday
after
the
eleventh
of
june
a
noted
was
formerly
held
at
the
fair
on
the
following
day
the
bonfire
is
still
lit
at
the
gloaming
by
the
lads
and
lasses
of
the
village
on
a
high
mound
or
hillock
just
outside
of
the
village
fuel
for
it
is
collected
by
the
lads
from
door
to
door
the
youth
dance
round
the
fire
and
leap
over
the
fringes
of
it
the
many
who
used
to
assemble
for
the
fair
were
wont
to
gather
round
the
blazing
pile
smoke
their
pipes
and
listen
to
the
young
folk
singing
in
chorus
on
the
hillock
afterwards
they
wrapped
themselves
in
their
plaids
and
slept
round
the
bonfire
which
was
intended
to
last
all
night
thomas
moresin
of
aberdeen
a
writer
of
the
sixteenth
century
says
that
on
peter
s
day
which
is
the
of
june
the
scotch
ran
about
at
night
with
lighted
torches
on
mountains
and
high
grounds
as
ceres
did
when
she
roamed
the
whole
earth
in
search
of
proserpine
and
towards
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
parish
minister
of
loudoun
a
district
of
ayrshire
whose
bonny
woods
and
braes
have
been
sung
by
burns
wrote
that
the
custom
still
remains
amongst
the
herds
and
young
people
to
kindle
fires
in
the
high
grounds
in
honour
of
beltan
which
in
gaelic
signifies
or
was
antiently
the
time
of
this
solemnity
it
is
now
kept
on
peter
s
all
over
spain
great
bonfires
called
are
still
lit
on
midsummer
eve
they
are
kept
up
all
night
and
the
children
leap
over
them
in
a
certain
rhythmical
way
which
is
said
to
resemble
the
ancient
dances
on
the
coast
people
at
this
season
plunge
into
the
sea
in
the
inland
districts
the
villagers
go
and
roll
naked
in
the
dew
of
the
meadows
which
is
supposed
to
be
a
sovereign
preservative
against
diseases
of
the
skin
on
this
evening
too
girls
who
would
pry
into
the
future
put
a
vessel
of
water
on
the
sill
outside
their
window
and
when
the
clocks
strike
twelve
they
break
an
egg
in
the
water
and
see
or
fancy
they
see
in
the
shapes
assumed
by
the
pulp
as
it
blends
with
the
liquid
the
likeness
of
future
bridegrooms
castles
coffins
and
so
forth

generally
as
might
perhaps
have
been

jump
over
them
for
luck
on
that
night
john
himself
is
supposed
to
appear
in
person
and
bless
all
the
seas
and
waters
driving
out
the
devils
and
demons
who
had
been
disporting
themselves
in
them
ever
since
the
second
day
of
november
that
is
why
in
the
interval
between
the
second
of
november
and
the
of
june
nobody
will
bathe
in
the
sea
or
in
a
hot
spring
on
midsummer
eve
too
you
can
always
see
the
devil
if
you
will
go
into
a
garden
at
midnight
he
is
invariably
found
standing
near
a
his
reason
for
adopting
this
posture
has
not
been
ascertained
perhaps
in
the
chilly
air
of
the
upper
world
he
is
attracted
by
the
genial
warmth
of
the
mustard
various
forms
of
divination
are
practised
by
people
in
the
azores
on
midsummer
eve
thus
a
egg
is
broken
into
a
glass
of
water
and
the
shapes
which
it
assumes
foreshadow
the
fate
of
the
person
concerned
again
seven
saucers
are
placed
in
a
row
filled
respectively
with
water
earth
ashes
keys
a
thimble
money
and
grass
which
things
signify
travel
death
widowhood
housekeeping
spinsterhood
riches
and
farming
a
blindfolded
person
touches
one
or
other
of
the
saucers
with
a
wand
and
so
discovers
his
or
her
fate
again
three
broad
beans
are
taken
one
is
left
in
its
skin
one
is
half
peeled
and
the
third
is
peeled
outright
the
three
denote
respectively
riches
competence
and
poverty
they
are
hidden
and
searched
for
and
he
who
finds
one
of
them
knows
accordingly
whether
he
will
be
rich
moderately
or
poor
again
girls
take
slips
of
paper
and
write
the
names
of
young
men
twice
over
on
them
these
they
fold
up
and
crumple
and
place
one
set
under
their
pillows
and
the
other
set
in
a
saucer
full
of
water
in
the
morning
they
draw
one
slip
of
paper
from
under
their
pillow
and
see
whether
one
in
the
water
has
opened
out
if
the
names
on
the
two
slips
are
the
same
it
is
the
name
of
her
future
husband
young
men
do
the
same
with
girls
names
once
more
if
a
girl
rises
at
sunrise
goes
out
into
the
street
and
asks
the
first
his
christian
name
that
will
be
her
husband
s
name
some
of
these
modes
of
divination
resemble
those
which
are
or
used
to
be
practised
in
scotland
at
hallowe
en
in
corsica
on
the
eve
of
john
the
people
set
fire
to
the
trunk
of
a
tree
or
to
a
whole
tree
and
the
young
men
and
maidens
dance
round
the
blaze
which
is
called
we
have
seen
that
at
ozieri
in
sardinia
a
great
bonfire
is
kindled
on
john
s
eve
and
that
the
young
people
dance
round
it
passing
to
italy
we
find
that
the
midsummer
fires
are
still
lighted
on
john
s
eve
in
many
parts
of
the
abruzzi
they
are
commonest
in
the
territory
which
was
inhabited
in
antiquity
by
the
vestini
they
are
rarer
in
the
land
of
the
ancient
marsi
and
they
disappear
entirely
in
the
lower
valley
of
the
sangro
for
the
most
part
the
fires
are
fed
with
straw
and
dry
grass
and
are
kindled
in
the
fields
near
the
villages
or
on
high
ground
as
they
blaze
up
the
people
dance
round
or
over
them
in
leaping
across
the
flames
the
boys
cry
out
st
john
preserve
my
thighs
and
legs
formerly
it
used
to
be
common
to
light
the
bonfires
also
in
the
towns
in
front
of
churches
of
john
and
the
remains
of
the
sacred
fire
were
carried
home
by
the
people
but
this
custom
has
mostly
fallen
into
disuse
however
at
celano
the
practice
is
still
kept
up
of
taking
brands
and
ashes
from
the
bonfires
to
the
houses
although
the
fires
are
no
longer
kindled
in
front
of
the
churches
but
merely
in
the
streets
in
the
abruzzi
water
also
is
supposed
to
acquire
certain
marvellous
and
beneficent
properties
on
john
s
night
hence
many
people
bathe
or
at
least
wash
their
faces
and
hands
in
the
sea
or
a
river
at
that
season
especially
at
the
moment
of
sunrise
such
a
bath
is
said
to
be
an
excellent
cure
for
diseases
of
the
skin
at
castiglione
a
casauria
the
people
after
washing
in
the
river
or
in
springs
gird
their
waists
and
wreath
their
brows
with
sprigs
of
briony
in
order
to
keep
them
from
aches
and
pains
in
various
parts
of
sicily
also
fires
are
kindled
on
midsummer
eve
john
s
eve
the
of
june
on
the
madonie
mountains
in
the
north
of
the
island
the
herdsmen
kindle
them
at
intervals
so
that
the
crests
of
the
mountains
are
seen
ablaze
in
the
darkness
for
many
miles
about
acireale
on
the
east
coast
of
the
island
the
bonfires
are
lit
by
boys
who
jump
over
them
at
chiaromonte
the
witches
that
night
acquire
extraordinary
powers
hence
everybody
then
puts
a
broom
outside
of
his
house
because
a
broom
is
an
excellent
protective
against
witchcraft
at
orvieto
the
midsummer
fires
were
specially
excepted
from
the
prohibition
directed
against
bonfires
in
general
in
malta
also
the
people
celebrate
midsummer
eve
john
s
eve
by
kindling
great
fires
in
the
public
streets
and
giving
their
children
dolls
to
carry
in
their
arms
on
this
day
in
order
to
make
good
the
prophecy
respecting
the
baptist
in
nativitate
ejus
days
and
even
weeks
before
this
festival
groups
of
children
are
seen
going
out
into
the
country
fields
to
gather
straw
twigs
and
all
sorts
of
other
combustibles
which
they
store
up
for
john
s
eve
on
the
night
of
the
of
june
the
day
before
the
festival
of
the
saint
great
fires
are
kindled
in
the
streets
squares
and
market
places
of
the
towns
and
villages
of
the
island
and
as
fire
after
fire
blazes
out
of
the
darkness
of
that
summer
night
the
effect
is
singularly
striking
these
fires
are
sometimes
kept
up
for
hours
being
continually
fed
by
the
scores
of
bystanders
who
take
great
delight
in
throwing
amidst
the
flames
some
old
rickety
piece
of
furniture
which
they
consider
as
lumber
in
their
houses
lots
of
happy
and
reckless
children
and
very
often
men
are
seen
merrily
leaping
in
succession
over
and
through
the
crackling
flames
at
the
time
of
the
order
of
john
of
jerusalem
the
grand
master
himself
soon
after
the
used
to
leave
his
palace
accompanied
by
the
grand
prior
the
bishop
and
two
bailiffs
to
set
fire
to
some
pitch
barrels
which
were
placed
for
the
occasion
in
the
square
facing
the
sacred
hospital
great
crowds
used
to
assemble
here
in
order
to
assist
at
this
ceremony
the
setting
ablaze
of
the
five
casks
and
later
on
of
the
eight
casks
by
the
grand
master
was
a
signal
for
the
others
to
kindle
their
fires
in
the
different
parts
of
the
in
greece
the
custom
of
kindling
fires
on
john
s
eve
and
jumping
over
them
is
said
to
be
still
universal
one
reason
assigned
for
it
is
a
wish
to
escape
from
the
fleas
according
to
another
account
the
women
cry
out
as
they
leap
over
the
fire
i
leave
my
sins
behind
in
lesbos
the
fires
on
john
s
eve
are
usually
lighted
by
threes
and
the
people
spring
thrice
over
them
each
with
a
stone
on
his
head
saying
i
jump

morning
of

s
day
those
who
dwell
near
the
coast
go
to
bathe
in
the
sea
as
they
go
they
gird
themselves
with
osiers
and
when
they
are
in
the
water
they
let
the
osiers
float
away
saying
let
my
maladies
go
away
then
they
look
for
what
is
called
the
hairy
stone
which
possesses
the
remarkable
property
not
only
of
keeping
moths
from
clothes
but
even
of
multiplying
the
clothes
in
the
chest
where
it
is
laid
up
and
the
more
hairs
on
the
stone
the
more
will
the
clothes
multiply
in
the
chest
in
calymnos
the
midsummer
fire
is
supposed
to
ensure
abundance
in
the
coming
year
as
well
as
deliverance
from
fleas
the
people
dance
round
the
fires
singing
with
stones
on
their
heads
and
then
jump
over
the
blaze
or
the
glowing
embers
when
the
fire
is
burning
low
they
throw
the
stones
into
it
and
when
it
is
nearly
out
they
make
crosses
on
their
legs
and
then
go
straightway
and
bathe
in
the
sea
in
cos
the
lads
and
lasses
dance
round
the
bonfires
on
john
s
eve
each
of
the
lads
binds
a
black
stone
on
his
head
signifying
that
he
wishes
to
become
as
strong
as
the
stone
also
they
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
their
feet
and
legs
and
jump
over
the
fire
on
midsummer
eve
the

in

the
garlands
now
faded
which
were
hung
over

are
taken
down
and

after
which
the

young
and

leap
over
them
for
such
a
leap
is
thought
to
be
good
for
the
health
from
the
old
world
the
midsummer
fires
have
been
carried
across
the
atlantic
to
america
in
brazil
people
jump
over
the
fires
of
john
and
at
this
season
they
can
take
hot
coals
in
their
mouths
without
burning
themselves
in
bolivia
on
the
eve
of
john
it
is
usual
to
see
bonfires
lighted
on
the
hills
and
even
in
the
streets
of
the
capital
la
paz
as
the
city
stands
at
the
bottom
of
an
immense
ravine
and
the
indians
of
the
neighbourhood
take
a
pride
in
kindling
bonfires
on
heights
which
might
seem
inaccessible
the
scene
is
very
striking
when
the
darkness
of
night
is
suddenly
and
simultaneously
lit
up
by
hundreds
of
fires
which
cast
a
glare
on
surrounding
objects
producing
an
effect
at
once
weird
and
picturesque
the
custom
of
kindling
bonfires
on
midsummer
day
or
on
midsummer
eve
is
widely
spread
among
the
mohammedan
peoples
of
north
africa
particularly
in
morocco
and
algeria
it
is
common
both
to
the
berbers
and
to
many
of
the
arabs
or
tribes
in
these
countries
midsummer
day
the
of
june
old
style
is
called
the
fires
are
lit
in
the
courtyards
at
in
the
fields
and
sometimes
on
the
plants
which
in
burning
give
out
a
thick
smoke
and
an
aromatic
smell
are
much
sought
after
for
fuel
on
these
occasions
among
the
plants
used
for
the
purpose
are
thyme
rue
camomile
geranium
and
people
expose
themselves
and
especially
their
children
to
the
smoke
and
drive
it
towards
the
orchards
and
the
crops
also
they
leap
across
the
fires
in
some
places
everybody
ought
to
repeat
the
leap
seven
times
moreover
they
take
burning
brands
from
the
fires
and
carry
them
through
the
houses
in
order
to
fumigate
them
they
pass
things
through
the
fire
and
bring
the
sick
into
contact
with
it
while
they
utter
prayers
for
their
recovery
the
ashes
of
the
bonfires
are
also
reputed
to
possess
beneficial
properties
hence
in
some
places
people
rub
their
hair
or
their
bodies
with
them
for
example
the
andjra
mountaineers
of
morocco
kindle
large
fires
in
open
places
of
their
villages
on
midsummer
day
men
women
and
children
jump
over
the
flames
or
the
glowing
embers
believing
that
by
so
doing
they
rid
themselves
of
all
misfortune
which
may
be
clinging
to
them
they
imagine
also
that
such
leaps
cure
the
sick
and
procure
offspring
for
childless
couples
moreover
they
burn
straw
together
with
some
marjoram
and
alum
in
the
fold
where
the
cattle
sheep
and
goats
are
penned
for
the
night
the
smoke
in
their
opinion
will
make
the
animals
thrive
on
midsummer
day
the
arabs
of
the
mnasara
tribe
make
fires
outside
their
tents
near
their
animals
on
their
fields
and
in
their
gardens
large
quantities
of
are
burned
in
these
fires
and
over
some
of
them
the
people
leap
thrice
to
and
fro
sometimes
small
fires
are
also
kindled
inside
the
tents
they
say
that
the
smoke
confers
blessings
on
everything
with
which
it
comes
into
contact
at
salee
on
the
atlantic
coast
of
morocco
persons
who
suffer
from
diseased
eyes
rub
them
with
the
ashes
of
the
midsummer
fire
and
in
casablanca
and
azemmur
the
people
hold
their
faces
over
the
fire
because
the
smoke
is
thought
to
be
good
for
the
eyes
the
arab
tribe
ulad
bu
aziz
in
the
dukkala
province
of
morocco
kindle
midsummer
bonfires
not
for
themselves
and
their
cattle
but
only
for
crops
and
fruit
nobody
likes
to
reap
his
crops
before
midsummer
day
because
if
he
did
they
would
lose
the
benefit
of
the
blessed
influence
which
flows
from
the
smoke
of
the
bonfires
again
the
beni
mgild
a
berber
tribe
of
morocco
light
fires
of
straw
on
midsummer
eve
and
leap
thrice
over
them
to
and
fro
they
let
some
of
the
smoke
pass
underneath
their
clothes
and
married
women
hold
their
breasts
over
the
fire
in
order
that
their
children
may
be
strong
moreover
they
paint
their
eyes
and
lips
with
some
black
powder
in
which
ashes
of
the
bonfire
are
mixed
and
in
order
that
their
horses
may
also
benefit
by
the
fires
they
dip
the
right
forelegs
of
the
animals
in
the
smoke
and
flames
or
in
the
hot
embers
and
they
rub
ashes
on
the
foreheads
and
between
the
nostrils
of
the
horses
berbers
of
the
rif
province
in
northern
morocco
similarly
make
great
use
of
fires
at
midsummer
for
the
good
of
themselves
their
cattle
and
their
they
jump
over
the
bonfires
in
the
belief
that
this
will
preserve
them
in
good
health
and
they
light
fires
under
to
keep
the
fruit
from
falling
untimely
and
they
imagine
that
by
rubbing
a
paste
of
the
ashes
on
their
hair
they
prevent
the
hair
from
falling
off
their
heads
in
all
these
moroccan
customs
we
are
told
the
beneficial
effect
is
attributed
wholly
to
the
smoke
which
is
supposed
to
be
endued
with
a
magical
quality
that
removes
misfortune
from
men
animals
and
crops
but
in
some
parts
of
morocco
people
at
midsummer
kindle
fires
of
a
different
sort
not
for
the
sake
of
fumigation
but
in
order
to
burn
up
misfortune
in
the
flames
thus
on
midsummer
eve
the
berber
tribe
of
the
beni
mgild
burn
three
sheaves
of
unthreshed
wheat
or
barley
one
for
the
children
one
for
the
crops
and
one
for
the
on
the
same
occasion
they
burn
the
tent
of
a
widow
who
has
never
given
birth
to
a
child
by
so
doing
they
think
to
rid
the
village
of
ill
luck
it
is
said
that
at
midsummer
the
zemmur
burn
a
tent
which
belongs
to
somebody
who
was
killed
in
war
during
a
feast
or
if
there
is
no
such
person
in
the
village
the
schoolmaster
s
tent
is
burned
instead
among
the
beni
ahsen
it
is
customary
for
those
who
live
near
the
river
sbu
to
make
a
little
hut
of
straw
at
midsummer
set
it
on
fire
and
let
it
float
down
the
river
similarly
the
inhabitants
of
salee
burn
a
straw
hut
on
the
river
which
flows
past
their
town
further
it
deserves
to
be
noticed
that
in
northern
africa
as
in
southern
europe
the
midsummer
festival
comprises
rites
concerned
with
water
as
well
as
with
fire
for
example
among
the
the
women
light
a
fire
in
an
oven
throw
perfumes
into
it
and
circumambulate
a
tank
which
they
also
incense
after
a
fashion
in
many
places
on
the
coast
as
in
the
province
of
oran
and
particularly
in
the
north
of
morocco
everybody
goes
and
bathes
in
the
sea
at
midsummer
and
in
many
towns
of
the
interior
such
as
fez
mequinez
and
especially
merrakech
people
throw
water
over
each

where

is

is
used
instead
according
to
the
mohammedan
principle
which
permits

to
be
performed
with
earth

water
can
not
be
spared

the
purpose
people
of
the
andjra
district
in
morocco
not
only
bathe
themselves
in
the

or
in
rivers
at
midsummer
they
also
bathe
their
animals
their
horses
mules
donkeys
cattle

and

for
they
think
that
on
that
day
water
possesses
a

misfortune

again
men
women
and
children
bathe
in
the

or

or
rivers
at

alleging
that
by
so
doing
they
protect
themselves
against
disease
for
the
whole

among
the
berbers
of
the
rif
district
the
custom
of

this
day
is
commonly
observed
and
animals
share
the
ablutions
the
celebration
of
a
midsummer
festival
by
mohammedan
peoples
is
particularly
remarkable
because
the
mohammedan
calendar
being
purely
lunar
and
uncorrected
by
intercalation
necessarily
takes
no
note
of
festivals
which
occupy
fixed
points
in
the
solar
year
all
strictly
mohammedan
feasts
being
pinned
to
the
moon
slide
gradually
with
that
luminary
through
the
whole
period
of
the
earth
s
revolution
about
the
sun
this
fact
of
itself
seems
to
prove
that
among
the
mohammedan
peoples
of
northern
africa
as
among
the
christian
peoples
of
europe
the
midsummer
festival
is
quite
independent
of
the
religion
which
the
people
publicly
profess
and
is
a
relic
of
a
far
older
paganism
there
are
indeed
independent
grounds
for
thinking
that
the
arabs
enjoyed
the
advantage
of
a
comparatively
solar
year
before
the
prophet
of
god
saddled
them
with
the
absurdity
and
inconvenience
of
a
purely
lunar
calendar
be
that
as
it
may
it
is
notable
that
some
mohammedan
people
of
north
africa
kindle
fires
and
bathe
in
water
at
the
movable
new
year
of
their
lunar
calendar
instead
of
at
the
fixed
midsummer
of
the
solar
year

others
again
practise
these
observances

among

people
kindle
a
large
bonfire
on

and
leap
to
and

over

uttering
words
which
imply
that
by
these

to
purify
themselves

who
inhabit
the
western
portion
of

and
also
among
the
tribes
of
the
plains
but
westermarck
found
no
traces
of
such
fires
among
the
mountaineers
of
northern
morocco
and
the
berbers
of
the
rif
province
further
it
should
be
observed
that
water
ceremonies
like
those
which
are
practised
at
midsummer
are
very
commonly
observed
in
morocco
at
the
new
year
that
is
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
first
month
on
the
morning
of
that
day
all
water
or
according
to
some
people
only
spring
water
is
endowed
with
a
magical
virtue
especially
before
sunrise
hence
at
that
time
the
people
bathe
and
pour
water
over
each
other
in
some
places
they
also
sprinkle
their
animals
tents
or
rooms
in
dukkala
some
of
the
new
year
water
is
preserved
at
home
till
new
year
s
day
of
next
year
some
of
it
is
kept
to
be
used
as
medicine
some
of
it
is
poured
on
the
place
where
the
corn
is
threshed
and
some
is
used
to
water
the
money
which
is
to
be
buried
in
the
ground
for
the
people
think
that
the
will
not
be
able
to
steal
the
buried
treasures
which
have
thus
been
sanctified
with
the
holy
water
thus
the
rites
of
fire
and
water
which
are
observed
in
morocco
at
midsummer
and
new
year
appear
to
be
identical
in
character
and
intention
and
it
seems
certain
that
the
duplication
of
the
rites
is
due
to
a
conflict
between
two
calendars
namely
the
old
julian
calendar
of
the
romans
which
was
based
on
the
sun
and
the
newer
mohammedan
calendar
of
the
arabs
which
is
based
on
the
moon
for
not
only
was
the
julian
calendar
in
use
throughout
the
whole
of
northern
africa
under
the
roman
empire
to
this
day
it
is
everywhere
employed
among
mohammedans
for
the
regulation
of
agriculture
and
all
the
affairs
of
daily
life
its
practical
convenience
has
made
it
indispensable
and
the
lunar
calendar
of
orthodox
mohammedanism
is
scarcely
used
except
for
purposes
of
chronology
even
the
old
latin
names
of
the
months
are
known
and
employed
in
slightly
disguised
forms
throughout
the
whole
moslem
world
and
little
calendars
of
the
julian
year
circulate
in
manuscript
among
mohammedans
permitting
them
to
combine
the
practical
advantages
of
pagan
science
with
a
nominal
adherence
to
orthodox
absurdity
thus
the
heathen
origin
of
the
midsummer
festival
is
too
palpable
to
escape
the
attention
of
good
mohammedans
who
accordingly
frown
upon
the
midsummer
bonfires
as
pagan
superstitions
precisely
as
similar
observances
in
europe
have
often
been
denounced
by
orthodox
christianity
indeed
many
religious
people
in
morocco
entirely
disapprove
of
the
whole
of
the
midsummer
ceremonies
maintaining
that
they
are
all
bad
and
a
conscientious
schoolmaster
will
even
refuse
his
pupils
a
holiday
at
midsummer
though
the
boys
sometimes
offer
him
a
bribe
if
he
will
sacrifice
his
scruples
to
his
avarice
as
the
midsummer
customs
appear
to
flourish
among
all
the
berbers
of
morocco
but
to
be
unknown
among
the
pure
arabs
who
have
not
been
affected
by
berber
influence
it
seems
reasonable
to
infer
with
westermarck
that
the
midsummer
festival
has
belonged
from
time
immemorial
to
the
berber
race
and
that
so
far
as
it
is
now
observed
by
the
arabs
of
morocco
it
has
been
learned
by
them
from
the
berbers
the
old
indigenous
inhabitants
of
the
country
westermarck
may
also
be
right
in
holding
that
in
spite
of
the
close
similarity
which
obtains
between
the
midsummer
festival
of
europe
and
the
midsummer
festival
of
north
africa
the
latter
is
not
a
copy
of
the
former
but
that
both
have
been
handed
down
independently
from
a
time
beyond
the
purview
of
history
when
such
ceremonies
were
common
to
the
mediterranean
race
the
autumn
fires
in
the
months
which
elapse
between
midsummer
and
the
setting
in
of
winter
the
european
festivals
of
fire
appear
to
be
few
and
unimportant
on
the
evening
of
the
first
day
of
august
which
is
the
festival
of
the
cross
bonfires
are
commonly
lit
in
macedonia
and
boys
jump
over
them
shouting
dig
up
bury
but
whom
or
what
they
wish
to
dig
up
or
bury
they
do
not
know
the
russians
hold
the
feast
of
two
martyrs
florus
and
laurus
on
the
eighteenth
day
of
august
old
style
on
this
day
the
russians
lead
their
horses
round
the
church
of
their
village
beside
which
on
the
foregoing
evening
they
dig
a
hole
with
two
mouths
each
horse
has
a
bridle
made
of
the
bark
of
the
the
horses
go
through
this
hole
one
after
the
other
opposite
to
one
of
the
mouths
of
which
the
priest
stands
with
a
sprinkler
in
his
hand
with
which
he
sprinkles
them
as
soon
as
the
horses
have
passed
by
their
bridles
are
taken
off
and
they
are
made
to
go
between
two
fires
that
they
kindle
called
by
the
russians
that
is
to
say
living
fires
of
which
i
shall
give
an
account
i
shall
before
remark
that
the
russian
peasantry
throw
the
bridles
of
their
horses
into
one
of
these
fires
to
be
consumed
this
is
the
manner
of
their
lighting
these
or
living
fires
some
men
hold
the
ends
of
a
stick
made
of
the
very
dry
and
about
a
fathom
long
this
stick
they
hold
firmly
over
one
of
birch
perfectly
dry
and
rub
with
violence
and
quickly
against
the
former
the
birch
which
is
somewhat
softer
than
the
plane
in
a
short
time
inflames
and
serves
them
to
light
both
the
fires
i
have
the
feast
of
the
nativity
of
the
virgin
on
the
eighth
day
of
september
is
celebrated
at
naples
and
capri
with
fireworks
bonfires
and
assassinations
on
this
subject
my
friend
professor
housman
who
witnessed
the
celebration
in
different
years
at
both
places
has
kindly
furnished
me
with
the
following
particulars
in
i
was
in
the
island
of
capri
on
september
the
eighth
the
feast
of
the
nativity
of
the
virgin
the
anniversary
was
duly
solemnised
by
at
nine
or
ten
in
the
evening
which
i
suppose
were
municipal
but
just
after
sundown
the
boys
outside
the
villages
were
making
small
fires
of
brushwood
on
waste
bits
of
ground
by
the
wayside
very
pretty
it
looked
with
the
flames
blowing
about
in
the
twilight
but
what
took
my
attention
was
the
listlessness
of
the
boys
and
their
lack
of
interest
in
the
proceeding
a
single
lad
the
youngest
would
be
raking
the
fire
together
and
keeping
it
alight
but
the
rest
stood
lounging
about
and
looking
in
every
other
direction
with
the
air
of
discharging
mechanically
a
traditional
office
from
which
all
zest
had
the
pious
orgy
at
naples
on
september
the
eighth
went
through
the
following
phases
when
i
witnessed
it
in
it
began
at
eight
in
the
evening
with
an
illumination
of
the
façade
of
santa
maria
piedigrotta
and
with
the
whole
population
walking
about
blowing
penny
trumpets
after
four
hours
of
this
i
went
to
bed
at
midnight
and
was
lulled
to
sleep
by
which
supersede
the
trumpets
about
that
hour
at
four
in
the
morning
i
was
waked
by
detonations
as
if
the
british
fleet
were
bombarding
the
city
caused
i
was
afterwards
told
by
dynamite
rockets
the
only
step
possible
beyond
this
is
assassination
which
accordingly
takes
place
about
peep
of
day
i
forget
now
the
number
of
the
slain
but
i
think
the
average
is
eight
or
ten
and
i
know
that
in
honour
of
my
presence
they
murdered
a
few
more
than
it
is
no
doubt
possible
that
these
illuminations
and
like
the
assassinations
are
merely
the
natural
and
spontaneous
expressions
of
that
overflowing
joy
with
which
the
thought
of
the
birth
of
the
virgin
must
fill
every
pious
heart
but
when
we
remember
how
often
the
church
has
skilfully
decanted
the
new
wine
of
christianity
into
the
old
bottles
of
heathendom
we
may
be
allowed
to
conjecture
that
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
adroitly
timed
the
nativity
of
the
virgin
so
as
to
coincide
with
an
old
pagan
festival
of
that
day
in
which
fire
noise
and
uproar
if
not
broken
heads
and
bloodshed
were
conspicuous
features
the
penny
trumpets
blown
on
this
occasion
recall
the
like
melodious
instruments
which
figure
so
largely
in
the
celebration
of
befana
the
eve
of
epiphany
at
rome
the
hallowe
en
fires
from
the
foregoing
survey
we
may
infer
that
among
the
heathen
forefathers
of
the
european
peoples
the
most
popular
and
widespread
of
the
year
was
the
great
celebration
of
midsummer
eve
or
midsummer
day
the
coincidence
of
the
festival
with
the
summer
solstice
can
hardly
be
accidental
rather
we
must
suppose
that
our
pagan
ancestors
purposely
timed
the
ceremony
of
fire
on
earth
to
coincide
with
the
arrival
of
the
sun
at
the
highest
point
of
his
course
in
the
sky
if
that
was
so
it
follows
that
the
old
founders
of
the
midsummer
rites
had
observed
the
solstices
or
of
the
sun
s
apparent
path
in
the
sky
and
that
they
accordingly
regulated
their
festal
calendar
to
some
extent
by
astronomical
considerations
but
while
this
may
be
regarded
as
fairly
certain
for
what
we
may
call
the
aborigines
throughout
a
large
part
of
the
continent
it
appears
not
to
have
been
true
of
the
celtic
peoples
who
inhabited
the
land
s
end
of
europe
the
islands
and
promontories
that
stretch
out
into
the
atlantic
ocean
on
the
the
principal
of
the
celts
which
have
survived
though
in
a
restricted
area
and
with
diminished
pomp
to
modern
times
and
even
to
our
own
day
were
seemingly
timed
without
any
reference
to
the
position
of
the
sun
in
the
heaven
they
were
two
in
number
and
fell
at
an
interval
of
six
months
one
being
celebrated
on
the
eve
of
may
day
and
the
other
on
allhallow
even
or
hallowe
en
as
it
is
now
commonly
called
that
is
on
the
of
october
the
day
preceding
all
saints
or
allhallows
day
these
dates
coincide
with
none
of
the
four
great
hinges
on
which
the
solar
year
revolves
to
wit
the
solstices
and
the
equinoxes
nor
do
they
agree
with
the
principal
seasons
of
the
agricultural
year
the
sowing
in
spring
and
the
reaping
in
autumn
for
when
may
day
comes
the
seed
has
long
been
committed
to
the
earth
and
when
november
opens
the
harvest
has
long
been
reaped
and
garnered
the
fields
lie
bare
the
are
stripped
and
even
the
yellow
leaves
are
fast
fluttering
to
the
ground
yet
the
first
of
may
and
the
first
of
november
mark
of
the
year
in
europe
the
one
ushers
in
the
genial
heat
and
the
rich
vegetation
of
summer
the
other
heralds
if
it
does
not
share
the
cold
and
barrenness
of
winter
now
these
particular
points
of
the
year
as
has
been
well
pointed
out
by
a
learned
and
ingenious
writer
while
they
are
of
comparatively
little
moment
to
the
european
husbandman
do
deeply
concern
the
european
herdsman
for
it
is
on
the
approach
of
summer
that
he
drives
his
cattle
out
into
the
open
to
crop
the
fresh
grass
and
it
is
on
the
approach
of
winter
that
he
leads
them
back
to
the
safety
and
shelter
of
the
stall
accordingly
it
seems
not
improbable
that
the
celtic
bisection
of
the
year
into
two
halves
at
the
beginning
of
may
and
the
beginning
of
november
dates
from
a
time
when
the
celts
were
mainly
a
pastoral
people
dependent
for
their
subsistence
on
their
herds
and
when
accordingly
the
great
epochs
of
the
year
for
them
were
the
days
on
which
the
cattle
went
forth
from
the
homestead
in
early
summer
and
returned
to
it
again
in
early
winter
even
in
central
europe
remote
from
the
region
now
occupied
by
the
celts
a
similar
bisection
of
the
year
may
be
clearly
traced
in
the
great
popularity
on
the
one
hand
of
may
day
and
its
eve
walpurgis
night
and
on
the
other
hand
of
the
feast
of
all
souls
at
the
beginning
of
november
which
under
a
thin
christian
cloak
conceals
an
ancient
pagan
festival
of
the
dead
hence
we
may
conjecture
that
everywhere
throughout
europe
the
celestial
division
of
the
year
according
to
the
solstices
was
preceded
by
what
we
may
call
a
terrestrial
division
of
the
year
according
to
the
beginning
of
summer
and
the
beginning
of
winter
be
that
as
it
may
the
two
great
celtic
festivals
of
may
day
and
the
first
of
november
or
to
be
more
accurate
the
eves
of
these
two
days
closely
resemble
each
other
in
the
manner
of
their
celebration
and
in
the
superstitions
associated
with
them
and
alike
by
the
antique
character
impressed
upon
both
betray
a
remote
and
purely
pagan
origin
the
festival
of
may
day
or
beltane
as
the
celts
called
it
which
ushered
in
summer
has
already
been
described
it
remains
to
give
some
account
of
the
corresponding
festival
of
hallowe
en
which
announced
the
arrival
of
winter
of
the
two
feasts
hallowe
en
was
perhaps
of
old
the
more
important
since
the
celts
would
seem
to
have
dated
the
beginning
of
the
year
from
it
rather
than
from
beltane
in
the
isle
of
man
one
of
the
fortresses
in
which
the
celtic
language
and
lore
longest
held
out
against
the
siege
of
the
saxon
invaders
the
first
of
november
old
style
has
been
regarded
as
new
year
s
day
down
to
recent
times
thus
manx
mummers
used
to
go
round
on
hallowe
en
old
style
singing
in
the
manx
language
a
sort
of
hogmanay
song
which
began
is
new
year
s
night
one
of
sir
john
rhys
s
manx
informants
an
old
man
of
had
been
a
farm
servant
from
the
age
of
sixteen
till
he
was
to
the
same
man
near
regaby
in
the
parish
of
andreas
and
he
remembers
his
master
and
a
near
neighbour
of
his
discussing
the
term
new
year
s
day
as
applied
to
the
first
of
november
and
explaining
to
the
younger
men
that
it
had
always
been
so
in
old
times
in
fact
it
seemed
to
him
natural
enough
as
all
tenure
of
land
ends
at
that
time
and
as
all
servant
men
begin
their
service
in
ancient
ireland
as
we
saw
a
new
fire
used
to
be
kindled
every
year
on
hallowe
en
or
the
eve
of
samhain
and
from
this
sacred
flame
all
the
fires
in
ireland
were
rekindled
such
a
custom
points
strongly
to
samhain
or
all
saints
day
the
first
of
november
as
new
year
s
day
since
the
annual
kindling
of
a
new
fire
takes
place
most
naturally
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
in
order
that
the
blessed
influence
of
the
fresh
fire
may
last
throughout
the
whole
period
of
twelve
months
another
confirmation
of
the
view
that
the
celts
dated
their
year
from
the
first
of
november
is
furnished
by
the
manifold
modes
of
divination
which
as
we
shall
see
presently
were
commonly
resorted
to
by
celtic
peoples
on
hallowe
en
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
their
destiny
especially
their
fortune
in
the
coming
year
for
when
could
these
devices
for
prying
into
the
future
be
more
reasonably
put
in
practice
than
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
as
a
season
of
omens
and
auguries
hallowe
en
seems
to
have
far
surpassed
beltane
in
the
imagination
of
the
celts
from
which
we
may
with
some
probability
infer
that
they
reckoned
their
year
from
hallowe
en
rather
than
beltane
another
circumstance
of
great
moment
which
points
to
the
same
conclusion
is
the
association
of
the
dead
with
hallowe
en
not
only
among
the
celts
but
throughout
europe
hallowe
en
the
night
which
marks
the
transition
from
autumn
to
winter
seems
to
have
been
of
old
the
time
of
year
when
the
souls
of
the
departed
were
supposed
to
revisit
their
old
homes
in
order
to
warm
themselves
by
the
fire
and
to
comfort
themselves
with
the
good
cheer
provided
for
them
in
the
kitchen
or
the
parlour
by
their
affectionate
kinsfolk
it
was
perhaps
a
natural
thought
that
the
approach
of
winter
should
drive
the
poor
shivering
hungry
ghosts
from
the
bare
fields
and
the
leafless
woodlands
to
the
shelter
of
the
cottage
with
its
familiar
fireside
did
not
the
lowing
kine
then
troop
back
from
the
summer
pastures
in
the
forests
and
on
the
hills
to
be
fed
and
cared
for
in
the
stalls
while
the
bleak
winds
whistled
among
the
swaying
boughs
and
the
snow
drifts
deepened
in
the
hollows
and
could
the
and
the
deny
to
the
spirits
of
their
dead
the
welcome
which
they
gave
to
the
cows
but
it
is
not
only
the
souls
of
the
departed
who
are
supposed
to
be
hovering
unseen
on
the
day
when
autumn
to
winter
resigns
the
pale
witches
then
speed
on
their
errands
of
mischief
some
sweeping
through
the
air
on
besoms
others
galloping
along
the
roads
on
which
for
that
evening
are
turned
into
steeds
the
fairies
too
are
all
let
loose
and
hobgoblins
of
every
sort
roam
freely
about
in
south
uist
and
eriskay
there
is
a
saying
en
will
come
will
come
or

will
be
set

will
be
at
full
speed
in

children
in

on

eve
a
bogie
sits
on
every
stile
on
that
night
in
ireland
all
the
fairy
hills
are
thrown
wide
open
and
the
fairies
swarm
forth
any
man
who
is
bold
enough
may
then
peep
into
the
open
green
hills
and
see
the
treasures

worse
than
that
the
cave
of
cruachan
in
connaught
known
as
the
of
ireland
is
unbarred
on
samhain
eve
or
hallowe
en
and
a
host
of
horrible
fiends
and
goblins
used
to
rush
forth
particularly
a
flock
of
birds
which
blighted
crops
and
killed
animals
by
their
poisonous
breath
the
scotch
highlanders
have
a
special
name
derived
from
for
the
dreadful
bogies
that
go
about
that
night
stealing
babies
and
committing
other
atrocities
and
though
the
fairies
are
a
kindlier
folk
it
is
dangerous
to
see
even
them
at
their
revels
on
hallowe
en
a
melancholy
case
of
this
sort
is
reported
from
the
ferintosh
district
of
the
highlands
though
others
say
that
it
happened
at
the
slope
of
big
stones
in
harris
two
young
men
were
coming
home
after
nightfall
on
hallowe
en
each
with
a
jar
of
whisky
on
his
back
when
they
saw
as
they
thought
a
house
all
lit
up
by
the
roadside
from
which
proceeded
the
sounds
of
music
and
dancing
in
reality
it
was
not
a
house
at
all
but
a
fairy
knoll
and
it
was
the
fairies
who
were
jigging
it
about
there
so
merrily
but
one
of
the
young
men
was
deceived
and
stepping
into
the
house
joined
in
the
dance
without
even
stopping
to
put
down
the
jar
of
whisky
his
companion
was
wiser
he
had
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
the
place
was
not
what
it
seemed
and
on
entering
he
took
the
precaution
of
sticking
a
needle
in
the
door
that
disarmed
the
power
of
the
fairies
and
he
got
away
safely
well
that
day
twelve
months
he
came
back
to
the
spot
and
what
should
he
see
but
his
poor
friend
still
dancing
away
with
the
jar
of
whisky
on
his
back
a
weary
man
was
he
as
you
may
well
believe
but
he
begged
to
be
allowed
to
finish
the
reel
which
he
was
in
the
act
of
executing
and
when
they
took
him
out
into
the
open
air
there
was
nothing
of
him
left
but
skin
and
bones
again
the
wicked
fairies
are
apt
to
carry
off
men
s
wives
with
them
to
fairyland
but
the
lost
spouses
can
be
recovered
within
a
year
and
a
day
when
the
procession
of
the
fairies
is
defiling
past
on
hallowe
en
always
provided
that
the
mortals
did
not
partake
of
elfin
food
while
they
were
in
elfinland
sometimes
valuable
information
may
be
obtained
from
the
fairies
on
hallowe
en
there
was
a
young
man
named
guleesh
in
the
county
of
mayo
near
his
house
was
a
or
old
fort
with
a
fine
grass
bank
running
round
it
one
hallowe
en
when
the
darkness
was
falling
guleesh
went
to
the
rath
and
stood
on
a
gray
old
flag
the
night
was
calm
and
still
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
stirring
nor
a
sound
to
be
heard
except
the
hum
of
the
insects
flitting
past
or
the
whistle
of
the
plovers
or
the
hoarse
scream
of
the
wild
geese
as
they
winged
their
way
far
overhead
above
the
white
fog
the
moon
rose
like
a
knob
of
fire
in
the
east
and
a
thousand
thousand
stars
were
twinkling
in
the
sky
there
was
a
little
frost
in
the
air
the
grass
was
white
and
crisp
and
crackled
under
foot
guleesh
expected
to
see
the
fairies
but
they
did
not
come
hour
after
hour
wore
away
and
he
was
just
bethinking
him
of
going
home
to
bed
when
his
ear
caught
a
sound
far
off
coming
towards
him
and
he
knew
what
it
was
in
a
moment
the
sound
grew
louder
and
louder
at
first
it
was
like
the
beating
of
waves
on
a
stony
shore
then
it
was
like
the
roar
of
a
waterfall
at
last
it
was
like
a
mighty
rushing
wind
in
the
tops
of
the
trees
then
the
storm
burst
upon
the
rath
and
sure
enough
the
fairies
were
in
it
the
rout
went
by
so
suddenly
that
guleesh
lost
his
breath
but
he
came
to
himself
and
listened
the
fairies
were
now
gathered
within
the
grassy
bank
of
the
rath
and
a
fine
uproar
they
made
but
guleesh
listened
with
all
his
ears
and
he
heard
one
fairy
saying
to
another
that
a
magic
herb
grew
by
guleesh
s
own
door
and
that
guleesh
had
nothing
to
do
but
pluck
it
and
boil
it
and
give
it
to
his
sweetheart
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
france
and
she
would
be
well
for
just
then
she
was
lying
very
guleesh
took
the
hint
and
everything
went
as
the
fairy
had
said
and
he
married
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
france
and
they
had
never
a
cark
nor
a
care
a
sickness
nor
a
sorrow
a
mishap
nor
a
misfortune
to
the
day
of
their
death
in
all
celtic
countries
hallowe
en
seems
to
have
been
the
great
season
of
the
year
for
prying
into
the
future
all
kinds
of
divination
were
put
in
practice
that
night
we
read
that
dathi
a
king
of
ireland
in
the
fifth
century
happening
to
be
at
the
druids
hill
in
the
county
of
sligo
one
hallowe
en
ordered
his
druid
to
forecast
for
him
the
future
from
that
day
till
the
next
hallowe
en
should
come
round
the
druid
passed
the
night
on
the
top
of
the
hill
and
next
morning
made
a
prediction
to
the
king
which
came
true
in
wales
hallowe
en
was
the
weirdest
of
all
the
nos
or
three
spirit
nights
when
the
wind
blowing
over
the
feet
of
the
corpses
bore
sighs
to
the
houses
of
those
who
were
to
die
within
the
year
people
thought
that
if
on
that
night
they
went
out
to
a
and
listened
to
the
wind
they
would
learn
all
the
most
important
things
that
would
befall
them
during
the
next
twelve
months
in
wales
too
not
so
long
ago
women
used
to
congregate
in
the
parish
churches
on
the
night
of
hallowe
en
and
read
their
fate
from
the
flame
of
the
candle
which
each
of
them
held
in
her
hand
also
they
heard
the
names
or
saw
the
coffins
of
the
parishioners
who
would
die
within
the
year
and
many
were
the
sad
scenes
to
which
these
gloomy
visions
gave
rise
and
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
anybody
who
pleased
could
hear
proclaimed
aloud
the
names
of
parishioners
doomed
to
perish
within
the
next
twelve
months
if
he
would
only
take
a
stool
and
go
and
sit
on
it
at
three
while
the
church
clock
was
striking
twelve
at
midnight
on
hallowe
en
it
was
even
in
his
power
to
save
the
destined
victims
from
their
doom
by
taking
with
him
articles
of
wearing
apparel
and
throwing
them
away
one
by
one
as
each
name
was
called
out
by
the
mysterious
voice
but
while
a
glamour
of
mystery
and
awe
has
always
clung
to
hallowe
en
in
the
minds
of
the
celtic
peasantry
the
popular
celebration
of
the
festival
has
been
at
least
in
modern
times
by
no
means
of
a
prevailingly
gloomy
cast
on
the
contrary
it
has
been
attended
by
picturesque
features
and
merry
pastimes
which
rendered
it
the
gayest
night
of
all
the
year
amongst
the
things
which
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
contributed
to
invest
the
festival
with
a
romantic
beauty
were
the
bonfires
which
used
to
blaze
at
frequent
intervals
on
the
heights
on
the
last
day
of
autumn
children
gathered
ferns
the
long
thin
stalks
called
and
everything
suitable
for
a
bonfire
these
were
placed
in
a
heap
on
some
eminence
near
the
house
and
in
the
evening
set
fire
to
the
fires
were
called
there
was
one
for
each
house
and
it
was
an
object
of
ambition
who
should
have
the
biggest
whole
districts
were
brilliant
with
bonfires
and
their
glare
across
a
highland
loch
and
from
many
eminences
formed
an
exceedingly
picturesque
like
the
beltane
fires
on
the
first
of
may
the
hallowe
en
bonfires
seem
to
have
been
kindled
most
commonly
in
the
perthshire
highlands
travelling
in
the
parish
of
moulin
near
pitlochrie
in
the
year
the
englishman
thomas
pennant
writes
that
hallow
eve
is
also
kept
sacred
as
soon
as
it
is
dark
a
person
sets
fire
to
a
bush
of
broom
fastened
round
a
pole
and
attended
with
a
crowd
runs
about
the
village
he
then
flings
it
down
heaps
great
quantity
of
combustible
matters
on
it
and
makes
a
great
bonfire
a
whole
tract
is
thus
illuminated
at
the
same
time
and
makes
a
fine
the
custom
has
been
described
more
fully
by
a
scotchman
of
the
eighteenth
century
john
ramsay
of
ochtertyre
on
the
evening
of
hallowe
en
the
young
people
of
every
hamlet
assembled
upon
some
eminence
near
the
houses
there
they
made
a
bonfire
of
ferns
or
other
fuel
cut
the
same
day
which
from
the
feast
was
called
or
a
fire
of
rest
and
pleasure
around
it
was
placed
a
circle
of
stones
one
for
each
person
of
the
families
to
whom
they
belonged
and
when
it
grew
dark
the
bonfire
was
kindled
at
which
a
loud
shout
was
set
up
then
each
person
taking
a
torch
of
ferns
or
sticks
in
his
hand
ran
round
the
fire
exulting
and
sometimes
times
they
went
into
the
adjacent
fields
where
if
there
was
another
company
they
visited
the
bonfire
taunting
the
others
if
inferior
in
any
respect
to
themselves
after
the
fire
was
burned
out
they
returned
home
where
a
feast
was
prepared
and
the
remainder
of
the
evening
was
spent
in
mirth
and
diversions
of
various
kinds
next
morning
they
repaired
betimes
to
the
bonfire
where
the
situation
of
the
stones
was
examined
with
much
attention
if
any
of
them
were
misplaced
or
if
the
print
of
a
foot
could
be
discerned
near
any
particular
stone
it
was
imagined
that
the
person
for
whom
it
was
set
would
not
live
out
the
year
of
late
years
this
is
less
attended
to
but
about
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
it
was
regarded
as
a
sure
prediction
the
hallowe
en
fire
is
still
kept
up
in
some
parts
of
the
low
country
but
on
the
western
coast
and
in
the
isles
it
is
never
kindled
though
the
night
is
spent
in
merriment
and
in
the
perthshire
parish
of
callander
which
includes
the
now
famous
pass
of
the
trossachs
opening
out
on
the
winding
and
wooded
shores
of
the
lovely
loch
katrine
the
hallowe
en
bonfires
were
still
kindled
down
to
near
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
the
fire
had
died
down
the
ashes
were
carefully
collected
in
the
form
of
a
circle
and
a
stone
was
put
in
near
the
circumference
for
every
person
of
the
several
families
interested
in
the
bonfire
next
morning
if
any
of
these
stones
was
found
to
be
displaced
or
injured
the
people
made
sure
that
the
person
represented
by
it
was
or
devoted
and
that
he
could
not
live
twelve
months
from
that
day
in
the
parish
of
logierait
which
covers
the
beautiful
valley
of
the
tummel
one
of
the
fairest
regions
of
all
scotland
the
hallowe
en
fire
was
somewhat
different
faggots
of
heath
broom
and
the
dressings
of
flax
were
kindled
and
carried
on
poles
by
men

numbers
of
these

often

boys
and
youths
collected
wood
and
conveyed
it
to
the
most
prominent
places
on
the
hill
sides
in
their
neighbourhood
some
of
the
heaps
were
as
large
as
a
or
after
dark
on

these
heaps
were
kindled
and
for
several
hours
both
sides
of
loch

were
illuminated
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
i
was
told
by
old
men
that
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
men
as
well
as
boys
took
part
in
getting
up
the
bonfires
and
that
when
the
fire
was
ablaze
all
joined
hands
and
danced
round
the
fire
and
made
a
great
noise
but
that
as
these
gatherings
generally
ended
in
drunkenness
and
rough
and
dangerous
fun
the
ministers
set
their
faces
against
the
observance
and
were
seconded
in
their
efforts
by
the
more
intelligent
and
in
the
community
and
so
the
practice
was
discontinued
by
adults
and
relegated
to
school
at
balquhidder
down
to
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
each
household
kindled
its
bonfire
at
hallowe
en
but
the
custom
was
chiefly
observed
by
children
the
fires
were
lighted
on
any
high
knoll
near
the
house
there
was
no
dancing
round
them
hallowe
en
fires
were
also
lighted
in
some
districts
of
the
of
scotland
such
as
buchan
villagers
and
farmers
alike
must
have
their
fire
in
the
villages
the
boys
went
from
house
to
house
and
begged
a
peat
from
each
householder
usually
with
the
words
ge
s
a
peat
t
burn
the
in
some
villages
the
lads
collected
the
peats
in
a
cart
some
of
them
drawing
it
along
and
the
others
receiving
the
peats
and
loading
them
on
the
cart
along
with
the
peats
they
accumulated
straw
furze
potato
haulm
everything
that
would
burn
quickly
and
when
they
had
got
enough
they
piled
it
all
in
a
heap
and
set
it
on
fire
then
each
of
the
youths
one
after
another
laid
himself
down
on
the
ground
as
near
to
the
fire
as
he
could
without
being
scorched
and
thus
lying
allowed
the
smoke
to
roll
over
him
the
others
ran
through
the
smoke
and
jumped
over
their
prostrate
comrade
when
the
heap
was
burned
down
they
scattered
the
ashes
each
one
took
a
share
in
this
part
of
the
ceremony
giving
a
kick
first
with
the
right
foot
and
then
with
the
left
and
each
vied
with
the
other
who
should
scatter
the
most
after
that
some
of
them
still
continued
to
run
through
the
scattered
ashes
and
to
pelt
each
other
with
the
peats
at
each
farm
a
spot
as
high
as
possible
not
too
near
the
steading
was
chosen
for
the
fire
and
the
proceedings
were
much
the
same
as
at
the
village
bonfire
the
lads
of
one
farm
when
their
own
fire
was
burned
down
and
the
ashes
scattered
sometimes
went
to
a
neighbouring
fire
and
helped
to
kick
the
ashes
about
referring
to
this
part
of
scotland
a
writer
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
observes
that
the
fire
another
relict
of
druidism
was
kindled
in
buchan
various
magic
ceremonies
were
then
celebrated
to
counteract
the
influence
of
witches
and
demons
and
to
prognosticate
to
the
young
their
success
or
disappointment
in
the
matrimonial
lottery
these
being
devoutly
finished
the
hallow
fire
was
kindled
and
guarded
by
the
male
part
of
the
family
societies
were
formed
either
by
pique
or
humour
to
scatter
certain
fires
and
the
attack
and
defence
were
often
conducted
with
art
and
with
down
to
about
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
braemar
highlanders
made
the
circuit
of
their
fields
with
lighted
torches
at
hallowe
en
to
ensure
their
fertility
in
the
coming
year
at
that
date
the
custom
was
as
follows
every
member
of
the
family
in
those
days
households
were
larger
than
they
are
now
was
provided
with
a
bundle
of
fir
can
les
with
which
to
go
the
round
the
father
and
mother
stood
at
the
hearth
and
lit
the
splints
in
the
peat
fire
which
they
passed
to
the
children
and
servants
who
trooped
out
one
after
the
other
and
proceeded
to
tread
the
bounds
of
their
little
property
going
slowly
round
at
equal
distances
apart
and
invariably
with
the
sun
to
go
withershins
seems
to
have
been
reserved
for
cursing
and
excommunication
when
the
fields
had
thus
been
circumambulated
the
remaining
spills
were
thrown
together
in
a
heap
and
allowed
to
burn
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
as
the
evening
of
hallowe
en
wore
on
young
people
gathered
in
one
of
the
houses
and
resorted
to
an
almost
endless
variety
of
games
or
rather
forms
of
divination
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
future
fate
of
each
member
of
the
company
were
they
to
marry
or
remain
single
was
the
marriage
to
take
place
that
year
or
never
who
was
to
be
married
first
what
sort
of
husband
or
wife
she
or
he
was
to
get
the
name
the
trade
the
colour
of
the
hair
the
amount
of
property
of
the
future
were
questions
that
were
eagerly
canvassed
and
the
answers
to
them
furnished
entertainment
nor
were
these
modes
of
divination
at
hallowe
en
confined
to
the
highlands
where
the
bonfires
were
kindled
they
were
practised
with
equal
faith
and
in
practically
the
same
forms
in
the
lowlands
as
we
learn
for
example
from
burns
s
poem
which
describes
the
auguries
drawn
from
a
variety
of
omens
by
the
ayrshire
peasantry
these
lowlanders
of
saxon
descent
may
well
have
inherited
the
rites
from
the
celts
who
preceded
them
in
the
possession
of
the
south
country
a
common
practice
at
hallowe
en
was
to
go
out
stealthily
to
a
neighbour
s
kailyard
and
there
with
shut
eyes
to
pull
up
the
first
kail
stock
that
came
to
hand
it
was
necessary
that
the
plants
should
be
stolen
without
the
knowledge
or
consent
of
their
owner
otherwise
they
were
quite
useless
for
the
purpose
of
divination
strictly
speaking
too
the
neighbour
upon
whose
garden
the
raid
was
made
should
be
unmarried
whether
a
bachelor
or
a
spinster
the
stolen
kail
was
taken
home
and
examined
and
according
to
its
height
shape
and
features
would
be
the
height
shape
and
features
of
the
future
husband
or
wife
the
taste
of
the
that
is
the
heart
of
the
stem
was
an
infallible
indication
of
his
or
her
temper
and
a
clod
of
earth
adhering
to
the
root
signified
in
proportion
to
its
size
the
amount
of
property
which
he
or
she
would
bring
to
the
common
stock
then
the
or
as
it
was
called
in
ayrshire
was
placed
over
the
lintel
of
the
door
and
the
baptismal
name
of
the
young
man
or
woman
who
first
entered
the
door
after
the
kail
was
in
position
would
be
the
baptismal
name
of
the
husband
or
wife
again
young
women
sowed
hemp
seed
over
nine
ridges
of
ploughed
land
saying
i
sow
hemp
seed
and
he
who
is
to
be
my
husband
let
him
come
and
harrow
on
looking
back
over

the
girl
would
see
the
figure
of
her
future
mate
behind
her
in
the
darkness

the
of
scotland
lint
seed
was
used
instead
of
hemp
seed
and
answered
the
purpose
quite
as
well
again
a
mode
of
ascertaining
your
future
husband
or
wife
was
this
take
a
clue
of
blue
yarn
and
go
to
a
throw
the
clue
into
the
kiln
but
keep
one
end
of
the
thread
in
your
hand
and
wind
it
on
to
another
clue
as
you
come
near
the
end
somebody
or
something
will
hold
the
other
end
tight
in
the
kiln
then
you
call
out
who
holds
giving
the
thread
at
the
same
time
a
gentle
pull
some
one
or
something
will
thereupon
pull
the
other
end
of
the
thread
and
a
voice
will
mention
the
name
of
your
future
husband
or
wife
another
way
is
this
go
to
the
barn
alone
and
secretly
be
sure
to
open
both
doors
and
if
possible
take
them
off
their
hinges
for
if
the
being
who
is
about
to
appear
should
catch
you
in
the
barn
and
clap
the
doors
to
on
you
he
or
she
might
do
you
a
mischief
having
done
this
take
the
sieve
or
which
in
lowland
scotch
is
called
a
or
and
go
through
the
action
of
winnowing
corn
repeat
it
thrice
and
at
the
third
time
the
apparition
of
your
future
husband
or
wife
will
pass
through
the
barn
entering
at
the
windy
door
and
passing
out
at
the
other
or
this
go
to
a
southward
running
stream
where
the
lands
of
three
lairds
meet
or
to
a
ford
where
the
dead
and
living
have
crossed
dip
the
left
sleeve
of
your
shirt
in
the
water
then
go
home
take
off
the
shirt
hang
it
up
before
a
fire
to
dry
and
go
to
bed
taking
care
that
the
bed
stands
so
that
you
can
see
your
shirt
hanging
before
the
fire
keep
awake
and
at
midnight
you
will
see
the
form
of
your
future
spouse
come
into
the
room
and
turn
the
other
side
of
the
sleeve
to
the
fire
to
dry
it
a
highland
form
of
divination
at
hallowe
en
is
to
take
a
shoe
by
the
tip
and
throw
it
over
the
house
then
observe
the
direction
in
which
the
toe
points
as
it
lies
on
the
ground
on
the
other
side
for
in
that
direction
you
are
destined
to
go
before
long
if
the
shoe
should
fall
sole
uppermost
it
is
very
unlucky
for
you
these
ways
of
prying
into
the
future
are
practised
outside
of
the
house
others
are
observed
in
the
kitchen
or
the
parlour
before
the
cheerful
blaze
of
the
fire
thus
the
white
of
eggs
dropped
in
a
glass
of
pure
water
indicates
by
certain
marks
how
many
children
a
person
will
have
the
impatience
and
clamour
of
the
children
eager
to
ascertain
the
exact
number
of
their
future
progeny
often
induced
the
housewife
to
perform
this
ceremony
for
them
by
daylight
and
the
kindly
mother
standing
with
her
face
to
the
window
dropping
the
white
of
an
egg
into
a
crystal
glass
of
clean
water
and
surrounded
by
a
group
of
children
intently
watching
her
proceedings
made
up
a
pretty
picture
when
the
fun
of
the
evening
had
fairly
commenced
the
names
of
eligible
or
likely
matches
were
written
on
the
and
the
young
man
who
wished
to
try
his
fortune
was
led
up
blindfolded
to
the
list
whatever
name
he
put
his
finger
on
would
prove
that
of
his
future
wife
again
two
nuts
representing
a
lad
and
a
lass
whose
names
were
announced
to
the
company
were
put
side
by
side
in
the
fire
if
they
burned
quietly
together
the
pair
would
be
man
and
wife
and
from
the
length
of
time
they
burned
and
the
brightness
of
the
flame
the
length
and
happiness
of
the
married
life
of
the
two
were
augured
but
if
instead
of
burning
together
one
of
the
nuts
leaped
away
from
the
other
then
there
would
be
no
marriage
and
the
blame
would
rest
with
the
person
whose
nut
had
thus
started
away
by
itself
again
a
dish
of
milk
and
meal
in
gaelic
in
lowland
scotch
or
of
beat
potatoes
was
made
and
a
ring
was
hidden
in
it
spoons
were
served
out
to
the
company
who
supped
the
contents
of
the
dish
hastily
with
them
and
the
one
who
got
the
ring
would
be
the
first
to
be
married
again
apples
and
a
silver
sixpence
were
put
in
a
tub
of
water
the
apples
naturally
floated
on
the
top
and
the
sixpence
sank
to
the
bottom
whoever
could
lift
an
apple
or
the
sixpence
from
the
water
with
his
mouth
without
using
his
teeth
was
counted
very
lucky
and
got
the
prize
to
himself
again
three
plates
or
basins
were
placed
on
the
hearth
one
was
filled
with
clean
water
another
with
dirty
water
and
the
third
was
empty
the
enquirer
was
blindfolded
knelt
in
front
of
the
hearth
and
groped
about
till
he
put
his
finger
in
one
of
them
if
he
lighted
on
the
plate
with
the
clean
water
he
would
wed
a
maid
if
on
the
plate
with
the
dirty
water
he
would
marry
a
widow
and
if
on
the
empty
plate
he
would
remain
a
bachelor
for
a
girl
the
answer
of
the
oracle
was
analogous
she
would
marry
a
bachelor
a
widower
or
nobody
according
to
the
plate
into
which
she
chanced
to
dip
her
finger
but
to
make
sure
the
operation
had
to
be
repeated
thrice
the
position
of
the
plates
being
changed
each
time
if
the
enquirer
put
his
or
her
finger
into
the
same
plate
thrice
or
even
twice
it
was
quite
conclusive
these
forms
of
divination
in
the
house
were
practised
by
the
company
in
a
body
but
the
following
had
to
be
performed
by
the
person
alone
you
took
an
apple
and
stood
with
it
in
your
hand
in
front
of
a
then
you
sliced
the
apple
stuck
each
slice
on
the
point
of
the
knife
and
held
it
over
your
left
shoulder
while
you
looked
into
the
glass
and
combed
your
hair
the
spectre
of
your
future
husband
would
then
appear
in
the
mirror
stretching
forth
his
hand
to
take
the
slices
of
the
apple
over
your
shoulder
some
say
that
the
number
of
slices
should
be
nine
that
you
should
eat
the
first
eight
yourself
and
only
throw
the
ninth
over
your
left
shoulder
for
your
husband
also
that
at
each
slice
you
should
say
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
the
again
take
an
egg
prick
it
with
a
pin
and
let
the
white
drop
into
a
nearly
full
of
water
take
some
of
this
in
your
mouth
and
go
out
for
a
walk
the
first
name
you
hear
called
out
aloud
will
be
that
of
your
future
husband
or
wife
an
old

told
a
lady
that
she
had
tried
this
mode
of
divination
in
her
youth
that
the
name

up

beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
says
that
the
autumnal
fire
is
still
kindled
in
north
wales
being
on
the
eve
of
the
first
day
of
november
and
is
attended
by
many
ceremonies
such
as
running
through
the
fire
and
smoke
each
casting
a
stone
into
the
fire
and
all
running
off
at
the
conclusion
to
escape
from
the
black
sow
then
supping
upon
parsnips
nuts
and
apples
catching
up
an
apple
suspended
by
a
string
with
the
mouth
alone
and
the
same
by
an
apple
in
a
tub
of
water
each
throwing
a
nut
into
the
fire
and
those
that
burn
bright
betoken
prosperity
to
the
owners
through
the
following
year
but
those
that
burn
black
and
crackle
denote
misfortune
on
the
following
morning
the
stones
are
searched
for
in
the
fire
and
if
any
be
missing
they
betide
ill
to
those
who
threw
them
according
to
sir
john
rhys
the
habit
of
celebrating
hallowe
en
by
lighting
bonfires
on
the
hills
is
perhaps
not
yet
extinct
in
wales
and
men
still
living
can
remember
how
the
people
who
assisted
at
the
bonfires
would
wait
till
the
last
spark
was
out
and
then
would
suddenly
take
to
their
heels
shouting
at
the
top
of
their
voices
the
cropped
black
sow
seize
the
hindmost
the
saying
as
sir
john
rhys
justly
remarks
implies
that
originally
one
of
the
company
became
a
victim
in
dead
earnest
down
to
the
present
time
the
saying
is
current
in
carnarvonshire
where
allusions
to
the
cutty
black
sow
are
still
occasionally
made
to
frighten
children
we
can
now
understand
why
in
lower
brittany
every
person
throws
a
pebble
into
the
midsummer
bonfire
doubtless
there
as
in
wales
and
the
highlands
of
scotland
omens
of
life
and
death
have
at
one
time
or
other
been
drawn
from
the
position
and
state
of
the
pebbles
on
the
morning
of
all
saints
day
the
custom
thus
found
among
three
separate
branches
of
the
celtic
stock
probably
dates
from
a
period
before
their
dispersion
or
at
least
from
a
time
when
alien
races
had
not
yet
driven
home
the
wedges
of
separation
between
them
in
wales
as
in
scotland
hallowe
en
was
also
the
great
season
for
forecasting
the
future
in
respect
of
love
and
marriage
and
some
of
the
forms
of
divination
employed
for
this
purpose
resembled
those
which
were
in
use
among
the
scotch
peasantry
two
girls
for
example
would
make
a
little
ladder
of
yarn
without
breaking
it
from
the
ball
and
having
done
so
they
would
throw
it
out
of
the
window
then
one
of
the
girls
holding
the
ball
in
her
hand
would
wind
the
yarn
back
repeating
a
rhyme
in
welsh
this
she
did
thrice
and
as
she
wound
the
yarn
she
would
see
her
future
husband
climbing
up
the
little
ladder
again
three
bowls
or
basins
were
placed
on
a
table
one
of
them
contained
clean
water
one
dirty
water
and
one
was
empty
the
girls
of
the
household
and
sometimes
the
boys
too
then
eagerly
tried
their
fortunes
they
were
blindfolded
led
up
to
the
table
and
dipped
their
hands
into
a
bowl
if
they
happened
to
dip
into
the
clean
water
they
would
marry
maidens
or
bachelors
if
into
the
dirty
water
they
would
be
widowers
or
widows
if
into
the
empty
bowl
they
would
live
unmarried
again
if
a
girl
walking
backwards
would
place
a
knife
among
the
leeks
on
hallowe
en
she
would
see
her
future
husband
come
and
pick
up
the
knife
and
throw
it
into
the
middle
of
the
garden
in
ireland
the
hallowe
en
bonfires
would
seem
to
have
died
out
but
the
hallowe
en
divination
has
survived
writing
towards
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
general
vallancey
tells
us
that
on
hallowe
en
or
the
vigil
of
saman
as
he
calls
it
the
peasants
in
ireland
assemble
with
sticks
and
clubs
the
emblems
of
laceration
going
from
house
to
house
collecting
money
butter
cheese
eggs
for
the
feast
repeating
verses
in
honour
of
the
solemnity
demanding
preparations
for
the
festival
in
the
name
of
columb
kill
desiring
them
to
lay
aside
the
fatted
calf
and
to
bring
forth
the
black
sheep
the
good
women
are
employed
in
making
the
griddle
cake
and
candles
these
last
are
sent
from
house
to
house
in
the
vicinity
and
are
lighted
up
on
the
saman
next
day
before
which
they
pray
or
are
supposed
to
pray
for
the
departed
souls
of
the
donor
every
house
abounds
in
the
best
viands
they
can
afford
apples
and
nuts
are
devoured
in
abundance
the
are
burnt
and
from
the
ashes
many
strange
things
are
foretold
cabbages
are
torn
up
by
the
root
hemp
seed
is
sown
by
the
maidens
and
they
believe
that
if
they
look
back
they
will
see
the
apparition
of
the
man
intended
for
their
future
spouse
they
hang
a
smock
before
the
fire
on
the
close
of
the
feast
and
sit
up
all
night
concealed
in
a
corner
of
the
room
convinced
that
his
apparition
will
come
down
the
chimney
and
turn
the
smock
they
throw
a
ball
of
yarn
out
of
the
window
and
wind
it
on
the
reel
within
convinced
that
if
they
repeat
the
backwards
and
look
at
the
ball
of
yarn
without
they
will
then
also
see
his
or
apparition
they
dip
for
apples
in
a
tub
of
water
and
endeavour
to
bring
one
up
in
the
mouth
they
suspend
a
cord
with
a
with
apples
at
one
point
and
candles
lighted
at
the
other
and
endeavour
to
catch
the
apple
while
it
is
in
a
circular
motion
in
the
mouth
these
and
many
other
superstitious
ceremonies
the
remains
of
druidism
are
observed
on
this
holiday
which
will
never
be
eradicated
while
the
name
of
is
permitted
to
in
queen
s
county
ireland
down
to
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
children
practised
various
of
these
rites
of
divination
on
hallowe
en
girls
went
out
into
the
garden
blindfold
and
pulled
up
cabbages
if
the
cabbage
was
well
grown
the
girl
would
have
a
handsome
husband
but
if
it
had
a
crooked
stalk
the
future
spouse
would
be
a
stingy
old
man
nuts
again
were
placed
in
pairs
on
the
bar
of
the
fire
and
from
their
behaviour
omens
were
drawn
of
the
fate
in
love
and
marriage
of
the
couple
whom
they
represented
lead
also
was
melted
and
allowed
to
drop
into
a
tub
of
cold
water
and
from
the
shapes
which
it
assumed
in
the
water
predictions
were
made
to
the
children
of
their
future
destiny
again
apples
were
bobbed
for
in
a
tub
of
water
and
brought
up
with
the
teeth
or
a
stick
was
hung
from
a
hook
with
an
apple
at
one
end
and
a
candle
at
the
other
and
the
stick
being
made
to
revolve
you
made
a
bite
at
the
apple
and
sometimes
got
a
mouthful
of
candle
instead
in
county
leitrim
also
down
to
near
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
various
forms
of
divination
were
practised
at
hallowe
en
girls
ascertained
the
character
of
their
future
husbands
by
the
help
of
cabbages
just
as
in
queen
s
county
again
if
a
girl
found
a
branch
of
a
which
had
bent
over
and
grown
into
the
ground
so
as
to
form
a
loop
she
would
creep
through
the
loop
thrice
late
in
the
evening
in
the
devil
s
name
then
cut
the
briar
and
put
it
under
her
pillow
all
without
speaking
a
word
then
she
would
lay
her
head
on
the
pillow
and
dream
of
the
man
she
was
to
marry
boys
also
would
dream
in
like
manner
of
love
and
marriage
at
hallowe
en
if
only
they
would
gather
ten
leaves
of
ivy
without
speaking
throw
away
one
and
put
the
other
nine
under
their
pillow
again
divination
was
practised
by
means
of
a
cake
called
in
which
a
nut
and
a
ring
were
baked
whoever
got
the
ring
would
be
married
first
whoever
got
the
nut
would
marry
a
widow
or
a
widower
but
if
the
nut
were
an
empty
shell
he
or
she
would
remain
unwed
again
a
girl
would
take
a
clue
of
worsted
go
to
a
lime
kiln
in
the
gloaming
and
throw
the
clew
into
the
kiln
in
the
devil
s
name
while
she
held
fast
the
other
end
of
the
thread
then
she
would
rewind
the
thread
and
ask
who
holds
my
clue
and
the
name
of
her
future
husband
would
come
up
from
the
depth
of
the
kiln
another
way
was
to
take
a
rake
go
to
a
rick
and
walk
round
it
nine
times
saying
i
rake
this
rick
in
the
devil
s
at
the
ninth
time
the
wraith
of
your
destined
partner
for
life
would
come
and
take
the
rake
out
of
your
hand
once
more
before
the
company
separated
for
the
night
they
would
rake
the
ashes
smooth
on
the
hearth
and
search
them
next
morning
for
tracks
from
which
they
judged
whether
anybody
should
come
to
the
house
or
leave
it
or
die
in
it
before
another
year
was
out
in
county
roscommon
which
borders
on
county
leitrim
a
cake
is
made
in
nearly
every
house
on
hallowe
en
and
a
ring
a
coin
a
sloe
and
a
chip
of
wood
are
put
into
it
whoever
gets
the
coin
will
be
rich
whoever
gets
the
ring
will
be
married
first
whoever
gets
the
chip
of
wood
which
stands
for
a
coffin
will
die
first
and
whoever
gets
the
sloe
will
live
longest
because
the
fairies
blight
the
sloes
in
the
hedges
on
hallowe
en
so
that
the
sloe
in
the
cake
will
be
the
last
of
the
year
again
on
the
same
mystic
evening
girls
take
nine
grains
of
oats
in
their
mouths
and
going
out
without
speaking
walk
about
till
they
hear
a
man
s
name
pronounced
it
will
be
the
name
of
their
future
husband
in
county
roscommon
too
on
hallowe
en
there
is
the
usual
dipping
in
water
for
apples
or
sixpences
and
the
usual
bites
at
a
revolving
apple
and
tallow
candle
in
the
isle
of
man
also
another
celtic
country
hallowe
en
was
celebrated
down
to
modern
times
by
the
kindling
of
fires
accompanied
with
all
the
usual
ceremonies
designed
to
prevent
the
baneful
influence
of
fairies
and
witches
bands
of
young
men
perambulated
the
island
by
night
and
at
the
door
of
every
they
struck
up
a
manx
rhyme
beginning
oie
howney
that
is
to
say
this
is
hollantide
for
hollantide
is
the
manx
way
of
expressing
the
old
english
hallowen
that
is
all
saints
day
the
first
of
november
but
as
the
people
reckon
this
festival
according
to
the
old
style
hollantide
in
the
isle
of
man
is
our
twelfth
of
november
the
native
manx
name
for
the
day
is
or
potatoes
parsnips
and
fish
pounded
up
together
and
mixed
with
butter
formed
the
proper
evening
meal
on
hallowe
en
in
the
isle
of
man
here
too
as
in
scotland
forms
of
divination
are
practised
by
some
people
on
this
important
evening
for
example
the
housewife
fills
a
thimble
full
of
salt
for
each
member
of
the
family
and
each
guest
the
contents
of
the
thimblefuls
are
emptied
out
in
as
many
neat
little
piles
on
a
plate
and
left
there
over
night
next
morning
the
piles
are
examined
and
if
any
of
them
has
fallen
down
he
or
she
whom
it
represents
will
die
within
the
year
again
the
women
carefully
sweep
out
the
ashes
from
under
the
fireplace
and
flatten
them
down
neatly
on
the
open
hearth
if
they
find
next
morning
a
footprint
turned
towards
the
door
it
signifies
a
death
in
the
family
within
the
year
but
if
the
footprint
is
turned
in
the
opposite
direction
it
bodes
a
marriage
again
divination
by
eavesdropping
is
practised
in
the
isle
of
man
in
much
the
same
way
as
in
scotland
you
go
out
with
your
mouth
full
of
water
and
your
hands
full
of
salt
and
listen
at
a
neighbour
s
door
and
the
first
name
you
hear
will
be
the
name
of
your
husband
again
manx
maids
bandage
their
eyes
and
grope
about
the
room
till
they
dip
their
hands
in
vessels
full
of
clean
or
dirty
water
and
so
on
and
from
the
thing
they
touch
they
draw
corresponding
omens
but
some
people
in
the
isle
of
man
observe
these
auguries
not
on
hallowe
en
or
hollantide
eve
as
they
call
it
which
was
the
old
manx
new
year
s
eve
but
on
the
modern
new
year
s
eve
that
is
on
the
of
december
the
change
no
doubt
marks
a
transition
from
the
ancient
to
the
modern
mode
of
dating
the
beginning
of
the
year
in
lancashire
also
some
traces
of
the
old
celtic
celebration
of
hallowe
en
have
been
reported
in
modern
times
it
is
said
that
fires
are
still
lighted
in
lancashire
on
hallowe
en
under
the
name
of
beltains
or
teanlas
and
even
such
cakes
as
the
jews
are
said
to
have
made
in
honour
of
the
queen
of
heaven
are
yet
to
be
found
at
this
season
amongst
the
inhabitants
of
the
banks
of
the
ribble
both
the
fires
and
the
cakes
however
are
now
connected
with
superstitious
notions
respecting
purgatory
on
hallowe
en
too
the
lancashire
maiden
strews
the
ashes
which
are
to
take
the
form
of
one
or
more
letters
of
her
lover
s
name
she
throws
over
her
shoulder
and
timidly
glances
to
see
who
follows
again
witches
in
lancashire
used
to
gather
on
hallowe
en
at
the
malkin
tower
a
ruined
and
desolate
in
the
forest
of
pendle
they
assembled
for
no
good
purpose
but
you
could
keep
the
infernal
rout
at
bay
by
carrying
a
lighted
candle
about
the
fells
from
eleven
to
twelve
o
clock
at
night
the
witches
tried
to
blow
out
the
candle
and
if
they
succeeded
so
much
the
worse
for
you
but
if
the
flame
burned
steadily
till
the
clocks
had
struck
midnight
you
were
safe
some
people
performed
the
ceremony
by
deputy
and
parties
went
about
from
house
to
house
in
the
evening
collecting
candles
one
for
each
inmate
and
offering
their
services
to
or
the
witches
as
the
phrase
ran
this
custom
was
practised
at
longridge
fell
in
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
northumberland
on
hallowe
en
omens
of
marriage
were
drawn
from
nuts
thrown
into
the
fire
and
the
sports
of
ducking
for
apples
and
biting
at
a
revolving
apple
and
lighted
candle
were
also
practised
on
that
evening
the
equivalent
of
the
hallowe
en
bonfires
is
reported
also
from
france
we
are
told
that
in
the
department
of
which
forms
part
of
the
old
province
of
poitou
young
people
used
to
assemble
in
the
fields
on
all
saints
day
the
first
of
november
and
kindle
great
fires
of
ferns
thorns
leaves
and
stubble
at
which
they
roasted
chestnuts
they
also
danced
round
the
fires
and
indulged
in
noisy
pastimes
the
midwinter
fires
if
the
heathen
of
ancient
europe
celebrated
as
we
have
good
reason
to
believe
the
season
of
midsummer
with
a
great
festival
of
fire
of
which
the
traces
have
survived
in
many
places
down
to
our
own
time
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
they
should
have
observed
with
similar
rites
the
corresponding
season
of
midwinter
for
midsummer
and
midwinter
or
in
more
technical
language
the
summer
solstice
and
the
winter
solstice
are
the
two
great
in
the
sun
s
apparent
course
through
the
sky
and
from
the
standpoint
of
primitive
man
nothing
might
seem
more
appropriate
than
to
kindle
fires
on
earth
at
the
two
moments
when
the
fire
and
heat
of
the
great
luminary
in
heaven
begin
to
wane
or
to
wax
in
this
way
the
savage
philosopher
to
whose
meditations
on
the
nature
of
things
we
owe
many
ancient
customs
and
ceremonies
might
easily
imagine
that
he
helped
the
labouring
sun
to
relight
his
dying
lamp
or
at
all
events
to
blow
up
the
flame
into
a
brighter
blaze
certain
it
is
that
the
winter
solstice
which
the
ancients
erroneously
assigned
to
the
of
december
was
celebrated
in
antiquity
as
the
birthday
of
the
sun
and
that
festal
lights
or
fires
were
kindled
on
this
joyful
occasion
our
christmas
festival
is
nothing
but
a
continuation
under
a
christian
name
of
this
old
solar
festivity
for
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
saw
fit
about
the
end
of
the
third
or
the
beginning
of
the
fourth
century
arbitrarily
to
transfer
the
nativity
of
christ
from
the
sixth
of
january
to
the
of
december
for
the
purpose
of
diverting
to
their
lord
the
worship
which
the
heathen
had
hitherto
paid
on
that
day
to
the
sun
in
modern
christendom
the
ancient
of
the
winter
solstice
appears
to
survive
or
to
have
survived
down
to
recent
years
in
the
old
custom
of
the
yule
log
clog
or
block
as
it
was
variously
called
in
england
the
custom
was
widespread
in
europe
but
seems
to
have
flourished
especially
in
england
france
and
among
the
south
slavs
at
least
the
fullest
accounts
of
the
custom
come
from
these
quarters
that
the
yule
log
was
only
the
winter
counterpart
of
the
midsummer
bonfire
kindled
within
doors
instead
of
in
the
open
air
on
account
of
the
cold
and
inclement
weather
of
the
season
was
pointed
out
long
ago
by
our
english
antiquary
john
brand
and
the
view
is
supported
by
the
many
quaint
superstitions
attaching
to
the
yule
log
superstitions
which
have
no
apparent
connexion
with
christianity
but
carry
their
heathen
origin
plainly
stamped
upon
them
but
while
the
two
solstitial
celebrations
were
both
festivals
of
fire
the
necessity
or
desirability
of
holding
the
winter
celebration
within
doors
lent
it
the
character
of
a
private
or
domestic
festivity
which
contrasts
strongly
with
the
publicity
of
the
summer
celebration
at
which
the
people
gathered
on
some
open
space
or
conspicuous
height
kindled
a
huge
bonfire
in
common
and
danced
and
made
merry
round
it
together
among
the
germans
the
custom
of
the
yule
log
is
known
to
have
been
observed
in
the
eleventh
century
for
in
the
year
the
parish
priest
of
ahlen
in
münsterland
spoke
of
bringing
a
tree
to
kindle
the
festal
fire
at
the
lord
s
down
to
about
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
old
rite
was
kept
up
in
some
parts
of
central
germany
as
we
learn
from
an
account
of
it
given
by
a
contemporary
writer
after
mentioning
the
custom
of
feeding
the
cattle
and
shaking
the
on
christmas
night
to
make
them
bear
fruit
he
goes
on
as
follows
other
customs
pointing
back
to
the
times
of
heathendom
may
still
be
met
with
among
the
peasants
of
the
mountain
regions
such
is
in
the
valleys
of
the
sieg
and
lahn
the
practice
of
laying
a
new
log
as
a
foundation
of
the
hearth
a
heavy
block
of
generally
a
stump
grubbed
up
from
the
ground
is
fitted
either
into
the
floor
of
the
hearth
or
into
a
niche
made
for
the
purpose
in
the
wall
under
the
hook
on
which
the
kettle
hangs
when
the
fire
on
the
hearth
glows
this
block
of
wood
glows
too
but
it
is
so
placed
that
it
is
hardly
reduced
to
ashes
within
a
year
when
the
new
foundation
is
laid
the
remains
of
the
old
block
are
carefully
taken
out
ground
to
powder
and
strewed
over
the
fields
during
the
twelve
nights
this
so
people
fancied
promotes
the
fruitfulness
of
the
year
s
in
some
parts
of
the
eifel
mountains
to
the
west
of
coblentz
a
log
of
wood
called
the
used
to
be
placed
on
the
hearth
on
christmas
eve
and
the
charred
remains
of
it
on
twelfth
night
were
put
in
the
to
keep
the
mice
from
devouring
the
corn
at
weidenhausen
and
girkshausen
in
westphalia
the
practice
was
to
withdraw
the
yule
log
from
the
fire
so
soon
as
it
was
slightly
charred
it
was
then
kept
carefully
to
be
replaced
on
the
fire
whenever
a
broke
because
the
people
believed
that
lightning
would
not
strike
a
house
in
which
the
yule
log
was
smouldering
in
some
villages
near
berleburg
in
westphalia
the
old
custom
was
to
tie
up
the
yule
log
in
the
last
sheaf
cut
at
harvest
on
christmas
eve
the
peasantry
of
the
oberland
in
meiningen
a
province
of
central
germany
used
to
put
a
great
block
of
wood
called
the
on
the
fire
before
they
went
to
bed
it
should
burn
all
night
and
the
charred
remains
were
believed
to
guard
the
house
for
the
whole
year
against
the
risk
of
fire
burglary
and
other
misfortunes
the
yule
log
seems
to
be
known
only
in
the
parts
of
switzerland
where
it
goes
by
the
usual
french
name
of
de
in
the
jura
mountains
of
the
canton
of
bern
while
the
log
is
burning
on
the
hearth
the
people
sing
a
blessing
over
it
as
follows
the
log
burn
all
good
come
in
the
women
have
the
sheep
lambs
bread
for
every
the
vat
full
of
wine
the
embers
of
the
yule
log
were
kept
carefully
for
they
were
believed
to
be
a
protection
against
lightning
the
christmas
fires
which
were
formerly
lit
everywhere
in
the
low
countries
have
fallen
into
disuse
but
in
flanders
a
great
log
of
wood
called
the
and
usually
cut
from
the
roots
of
a
fir
or
a
beech
is
still
put
on
the
fire
all
the
lights
in
the
house
are
extinguished
and
the
whole
family
gathers
round
the
log
to
spend
part
of
the
night
in
singing
in
telling
stories
especially
about
ghosts
and
so
on
and
also
in
drinking
gin
at
grammont
and
in
the
neighbourhood
of
that
town
where
the
yule
log
is
called
it
is
customary
to
set
fire
to
the
remainder
of
the
gin
at
the
moment
when
the
log
is
reduced
to
ashes
elsewhere
a
piece
of
the
log
is
kept
and
put
under
the
bed
to
protect
the
house
against
thunder
and
lightning
the
charcoal
of
the
log
which
burned
during
christmas
night
if
pounded
up
and
mixed
with
water
is
a
cure
for
consumption
in
the
country
of
limburg
the
log
burns
several
nights
and
the
pounded
charcoal
is
kept
as
a
preventive
so
they
say
of
in
several
provinces
of
france
and
particularly
in
provence
the
custom
of
the
yule
log
or
as
it
was
called
in
many
places
was
long
observed
a
french
writer
of
the
seventeenth
century
tells
us
that
on
christmas
eve
the
log
was
prepared
and
when
the
whole
family
had
assembled
in
the
kitchen
or
parlour
of
the
house
they
went
and
brought
it
in
walking
in
procession
and
singing
provençal
verses
to
the
following
effect
the
log
rejoice
is
the
day
of
bread
all
good
enter
here
the
women
bear
children
the
bring
forth
kids
the
ewes
drop
lambs
there
be
much
wheat
and
flour
the
vat
full
of
then
the
log
was
blessed
by
the
smallest
and
youngest
child
of
the
house
who
poured
a
glass
of
wine
over
it
saying
nomine
etc
after
which
the
log
was
set
on
the
fire
the
charcoal
of
the
burnt
wood
was
kept
the
whole
year
and
used
as
an
ingredient
in
several
remedies
amongst
the
superstitions
denounced
by
the
same
writer
is
the
belief
that
a
log
called
the
or
christmas
brand
which
you
put
on
the
fire
for
the
first
time
on
christmas
eve
and
continue
to
put
on
the
fire
for
a
little
while
every
day
till
twelfth
night
can
if
kept
under
the
bed
protect
the
house
for
a
whole
year
from
fire
and
thunder
that
it
can
prevent
the
inmates
from
having
chilblains
on
their
heels
in
winter
that
it
can
cure
the
cattle
of
many
maladies
that
if
a
piece
of
it
be
steeped
in
the
water
which
cows
drink
it
helps
them
to
calve
and
lastly
that
if
the
ashes
of
the
log
be
strewn
on
the
fields
it
can
save
the
wheat
from
in
marseilles
the
yule
log
used
to
be
a
great
block
of
oak
which
went
by
the
name
of
or
it
was
sprinkled
with
wine
and
oil
and
the
head
of
the
house
kindled
it
himself
the
yule
log
plays
a
great
part
at
the
festival
of
the
winter
solstice
in
perigord
the
countryman
thinks
that
it
is
best
made
of
cherry
or
oak
and
that
the
larger
it
is
the
better
if
it
burns
well
it
is
a
good
omen
the
blessing
of
heaven
rests
upon
it
the
charcoal
and
ashes
which
are
collected
very
carefully
are
excellent
for
healing
swollen
glands
the
part
of
the
trunk
which
has
not
been
burnt
in
the
fire
is
used
by
ploughmen
to
make
the
wedge
ou
for
their
plough
because
they
allege
that
it
causes
the
seeds
to
thrive
better
and
the
women
keep
pieces
of
it
till
twelfth
night
for
the
sake
of
their
chickens
nevertheless
if
you
sit
down
on
the
log
you
become
subject
to
boils
and
to
cure
yourself
of
them
you
must
pass
nine
times
under
a
bramble
branch
which
happens
to
be
rooted
in
the
ground
at
both
ends
the
charcoal
heals
sheep
of
a
disease
called
the
and
the
ashes
carefully
wrapt
up
in
white
linen
preserve
the
whole
household
from
accidents
some
people
think
that
they
will
have
as
many
chickens
as
there
are
sparks
that
fly
out
of
the
brands
of
the
log
when
they
shake
them
and
others
place
the
extinct
brands
under
the
bed
to
drive
away
vermin
in
vienne
on
christmas
eve
when
supper
is
over
the
master
of
the
house
has
a
great
christmas
in
and
then
surrounded
by
all
the
spectators
gathered
in
profound
silence
he
sprinkles
salt
and
water
on
the
log
it
is
then
put
on
the
fire
to
burn
during
the
three
festivals
but
they
carefully
preserve
a
piece
to
be
kindled
every
time
that
it
in
berry
a
district
of
central
france
the
yule
log
was
called
the
de
the
last
word
being
an
abbreviation
of
the
usual
french
word
for
christmas
noël
it
consisted
of
an
enormous
so
heavy
that
the
united
strength
of
several
men
was
needed
to
carry
it
in
and
place
it
on
the
hearth
where
it
served
to
feed
the
fire
during
the
three
days
of
the
christmas
festivity
strictly
speaking
it
should
be
the
trunk
of
an
old
which
had
never
been
lopped
and
had
been
felled
at
midnight
it
was
placed
on
the
hearth
at
the
moment
when
the
tinkle
of
the
bell
announced
the
elevation
of
the
host
at
the
midnight
mass
and
the
head
of
the
family
after
sprinkling
it
with
holy
water
set
it
on
fire
the
remains
of
the
log
were
preserved
till
the
same
day
next
year
they
were
kept
under
the
bed
of
the
master
of
the
house
and
whenever
thunder
was
heard
one
of
the
family
would
take
a
piece
of
the
log
and
throw
it
on
the
fire
which
was
believed
to
guard
the
family
against
lightning
in
the
middle
ages
we
are
told
several
fiefs
were
granted
on
condition
that
the
vassal
should
bring
in
person
a
yule
log
every
year
for
the
hearth
of
his
liege
lord
similar
customs
and
beliefs
survived
till
recent
years
in
some
of
the
remote
country
villages
of
the
picturesque
district
known
as
the
bocage
of
normandy
there
it
was
the
grandfather
or
other
oldest
man
of
the
family
who
chose
the
yule
log
in
good
time
and
had
it
ready
for
christmas
eve
then
he
placed
it
on
the
hearth
at
the
moment
when
the
church
bell
began
to
ring
for
the
evening
service
kneeling
reverently
at
the
hearth
with
the
members
of
his
family
in
a
like
attitude
of
devotion
the
old
man
recited
three
and
three
and
invoked
the
blessing
of
heaven
on
the
log
and
on
the
cottage
then
at
the
sound
of
the
bell
which
proclaimed
the
sacrament
of
the
mass
or
if
the
church
was
too
far
off
to
allow
the
tinkle
of
the
bell
to
be
heard
at
the
moment
when
they
judged
that
the
priest
was
elevating
the
host
before
the
high
altar
the
patriarch
sprinkled
the
burning
log
with
holy
water
blessed
it
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
and
drew
it
out
of
the
fire
the
charred
log
was
then
carefully
kept
till
the
following
christmas
as
a
precious
relic
which
would
guard
the
house
against
the
levin
bolt
evil
spirits
sorcerers
and
every
misfortune
that
might
befall
in
the
course
of
the
year
in
the
department
of
orne
the
is
called
holy
water
is
poured
on
it
it
should
last
the
three
days
of
the
festival
and
the
remains
of
it
are
kept
to
be
put
on
the
fire
when
it
thunders
this
brand
is
a
protection
both
against
thunder
and
against
in
upper
brittany
also
the
yule
log
is
thought
to
be
a
safeguard
against
thunder
and
lightning
it
is
sprinkled
with
holy
water
on
christmas
morning
and
allowed
to
burn
till
evening
if
a
piece
of
it
is
thrown
into
the
well
it
will
ensure
a
supply
of
good
water
in
almost
all
the
families
of
the
ardennes
we
are
told
at
the
present
day
they
never
fail
to
put
the
yule
log
on
the
fireplace
but
formerly
it
was
the
object
of
a
superstitious
worship
which
is
now
obsolete
the
charred
remains
of
it
placed
under
the
pillow
or
under
the
house
preserved
the
house
from
storms
and
before
it
was
burned
the
virgin
used
to
come
and
sit
on
it
invisible
swaddling
the
infant
jesus
at
nouzon
twenty
years
ago
the
traditional
log
was
brought
into
the
kitchen
on
christmas
eve
and
the
grandmother
with
a
sprig
of
box
in
her
hand
sprinkled
the
log
with
holy
water
as
soon
as
the
clock
struck
the
first
stroke
of
midnight
as
she
did
so
she
chanted
christmas
comes
one
should
rejoice
it
is
a
new
following
the
grandmother
and
joining
in
the
song
the
children
and
the
rest
of
the
family
marched
thrice
round
the
log
which
was
as
fine
a
log
as
could
be
we
can
now
perhaps
understand
why
in
perigord
people
who
sat
on
the
yule
log
suffered
from
boils
and
why
in
lorraine
young
folks
used
to
be
warned
that
if
they
sat
on
it
they
would
have
the
scab
the
reason
probably
was
that
the
virgin
and
child
were
supposed
to
be
seated
invisible
upon
the
log
and
to
resent
the
indignity
of
contact
with
mortal
children
on
christmas
eve
the
mountaineers
of
rupt
in
the
vosges
also
never
fail
to
put
on
the
hearth
the
largest
log
which
the
hearth
can
hold
they
call
it
galeuche
de
that
is
the
yule
log
next
morning
they
rake
the
ashes
for
any
charred
fragments
and
keep
them
as
valuable
talismans
to
guard
them
against
the
stroke
of
lightning
at
vagney
and
other
places
near
it
in
the
vosges
it
used
to
be
customary
on
the
same
evening
to
grease
the
hinges
and
the
latches
of
the
doors
that
no
harsh
grating
sound
should
break
the
slumbers
of
the
infant
christ
in
the
vosges
mountains
too
as
indeed
in
many
other
places
cattle
acquired
the
gift
of
speech
on
christmas
eve
and
conversed
with
each
other
in
the
language
of
christians
their
conversation
was
indeed
most
instructive
for
the
future
it
seems
had
no
secret
worth
mentioning
for
them
yet
few
people
cared
to
be
caught
eavesdropping
at
the
byre
wise
folk
contented
themselves
with
setting
a
good
store
of
fodder
in
the
manger
then
shut
the
door
and
left
the
animals
to
their
ruminations
a
farmer
of
vecoux
once
hid
in
a
corner
of
the
byre
to
overhear
the
edifying
talk
of
the
beasts
but
it
did
him
little
good
for
one
ox
said
to
another
ox
what
shall
we
do
and
the
other
replied
we
shall
carry
our
master
to
the
sure
enough
the
farmer
died
that
very
night
and
was
buried
next
morning
in
the
province
of
france
to
the
west
of
the
jura
mountains
if
the
yule
log
is
really
to
protect
a
house
against
thunder
and
lightning
it
is
essential
that
it
should
burn
during
the
midnight
mass
and
that
the
flame
should
not
go
out
before
the
divine
service
is
concluded
otherwise
the
log
is
quite
useless
for
the
purpose
in
burgundy
the
log
which
is
placed
on
the
fire
on
christmas
eve
is
called
the
while
it
is
burning
the
father
of
the
family
assisted
by
his
wife
and
children
sings
christmas
carols
and
when
he
has
finished
he
tells
the
smallest
children
to
go
into
a
corner
of
the
room
and
pray
god
that
the
log
may
give
them
sweeties
the
prayer
is
invariably
answered
in
england
the
customs
and
beliefs
concerning
the
yule
log
clog
or
block
as
it
was
variously
called
used
to
be
similar
on
the
night
of
christmas
eve
says
the
antiquary
john
brand
our
ancestors
were
wont
to
light
up
candles
of
an
uncommon
size
called
christmas
candles
and
lay
a
log
of
wood
upon
the
fire
called
a
or
to
illuminate
the
house
and
as
it
were
to
turn
night
into
day
this
custom
is
in
some
measure
still
kept
up
in
the
north
of
england
in
the
buttery
of
john
s
college
oxford
an
ancient
of
stone
still
remains
ornamented
with
the
figure
of
the
holy
lamb
it
was
formerly
used
to
burn
the
christmas
candle
in
on
the
high
table
at
supper
during
the
twelve
nights
of
that
a
tall
mould
candle
called
a
yule
candle
is
lighted
and
set
on
the
table
these
candles
are
presented
by
the
chandlers
and
grocers
to
their
customers
the
is
bought
of
the
carpenters
lads
it
would
be
unlucky
to
light
either
of
them
before
the
time
or
to
stir
the
fire
or
candle
during
the
supper
the
candle
must
not
be
snuffed
neither
must
any
one
stir
from
the
table
till
supper
is
ended
in
these
suppers
it
is
considered
unlucky
to
have
an
odd
number
at
table
a
fragment
of
the
log
is
occasionally
saved
and
put
under
a
bed
to
remain
till
next
christmas
it
secures
the
house
from
fire
a
small
piece
of
it
thrown
into
a
fire
occurring
at
the
house
of
a
neighbour
will
quell
the
raging
flame
a
piece
of
the
candle
should
likewise
be
kept
to
ensure
good
in
the
seventeenth
century
as
we
learn
from
some
verses
of
herrick
the
english
custom
was
to
light
the
yule
log
with
a
fragment
of
its
predecessor
which
had
been
kept
throughout
the
year
for
the
purpose
where
it
was
so
kept
the
fiend
could
do
no
mischief
indeed
the
practice
of
preserving
a
piece
of
the
of
one
year
to
light
that
of
the
next
was
observed
by
at
least
one
family
at
cheadle
in
staffordshire
down
to
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
the
north
of
england
used
to
lay
by
a
large
knotty
block
of
wood
for
the
christmas
fire
and
so
long
as
the
block
lasted
they
were
entitled
by
custom
to
ale
at
their
meals
the
log
was
as
large
as
the
hearth
could
hold
at
belford
in
northumberland
the
lord
of
the
manor
sends
round
to
every
house
on
the
afternoon
of
christmas
eve
the
yule
or
five
large
be
burnt
on
christmas
eve
and
day
this
old
custom
has
always
i
am
told
been
kept
up
the
custom
of
burning
the
yule
log
at
christmas
used
to
be
observed
in
wensleydale
and
other
parts
of
yorkshire
and
prudent
housewives
carefully
preserved
pieces
of
the
log
throughout
the
year
at
whitby
the
portions
so
kept
were
stowed
away
under
the
bed
till
next
christmas
when
they
were
burnt
with
the
new
log
in
the
interval
they
were
believed
to
protect
the
house
from
conflagration
and
if
one
of
them
were
thrown
into
the
fire
it
would
quell
a
raging
storm
the
practice
and
the
belief
were
similar
at
filey
on
the
coast
of
yorkshire
where
besides
the
yule
log
a
tall
yule
candle
was
lit
on
the
same
evening
in
the
west
riding
while
the
log
blazed
cheerfully
the
people
quaffed
their
ale
and
sang
yule
yule
a
pack
of
new
cards
and
a
christmas
stool
at
clee
in
lincolnshire
when
christmas
eve
has
come
the
yule
cake
is
duly
cut
and
the
yule
log
lit
and
i
know
of
some
even
houses
where
the
new
log
must
always
rest
upon
and
be
lighted
by
the
old
one
a
small
portion
of
which
has
been
carefully
stored
away
to
preserve
a
continuity
of
light
and
at
the
village
of
wootton
wawen
in
warwickshire
down
to
at
least
the
as
it
was
called
was
drawn
into
the
house
by
a
horse
on
christmas
eve
as
a
foundation
for
the
fire
on
christmas
day
and
according
to
the
superstition
of
those
times
for
the
twelve
days
following
as
the
said
block
was
not
to
be
entirely
reduc
d
to
ashes
till
that
time
had
passed
as
late
as
or
thereabout
the
scene
of
lighting
the
on
christmas
eve
to
continue
burning
throughout
the
christmas
season
might
have
been
witnessed
in
the
secluded
and
beautiful
of
west
shropshire
from
chirbury
and
worthen
to
pulverbatch
and
pontesbury
the
christmas
brand
or
brund
as
they
called
it
was
a
great
trunk
of
seasoned
oak
holly
yew
or
drawn
by
horses
to
the
door
and
thence
rolled
by
means
of
rollers
and
levers
to
the
back
of
the
wide
open
hearth
where
the
fire
was
made
up
in
front
of
it
the
embers
were
raked
up
to
it
every
night
and
it
was
carefully
tended
that
it
might
not
go
out
during
the
whole
christmas
season
all
those
days
no
light
might
be
struck
given
or
borrowed
such
was
the
custom
at
worthen
in
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
herefordshire
the
christmas
feast
lasted
for
twelve
days
and
no
work
was
done
all
houses
were
and
are
now
decorated
with
sprigs
of
holly
and
ivy
which
must
not
be
brought
in
until
christmas
eve
a
yule
log
as
large
as
the
open
hearth
could
accommodate
was
brought
into
the
kitchen
of
each
farmhouse
and
smaller
ones
were
used
in
the
cottages
said
he
had
seen
a
tree
drawn
into
the
kitchen
at
kingstone
grange
years
ago
by
two
cart
horses
when
it
had
been
consumed
a
small
portion
was
carefully
kept
to
be
used
for
lighting
next
year
s
log
mother
always
kept
it
very
carefully
she
said
it
was
lucky
and
kept
the
house
from
fire
and
from
it
seems
to
have
been
the
general
practice
to
light
it
on
christmas
in
many
parts
of
wales
it
is
still
customary
to
keep
part
of
the
until
the
following
christmas
eve
for
it
is
then
put
into
the
fireplace
and
burnt
but
before
it
is
consumed
the
new
log
is
put
on
and
thus
the
old
fire
and
the
new
burn
together
in
some
families
this
is
done
from
force
of
habit
and
they
can
not
now
tell
why
they
do
it
but
in
the
past
the
observance
of
this
custom
was
to
keep
witches
away
and
doubtless
was
a
survival
of
but
nowhere
apparently
in
europe
is
the
old
heathen
ritual
of
the
yule
log
preserved
to
the
present
day
more
perfectly
than
in
servia
at
early
dawn
on
christmas
eve
every
peasant
house
sends
two
of
its
strongest
young
men
to
the
nearest
forest
to
cut
down
a
young
oak
tree
and
bring
it
home
there
after
offering
up
a
short
prayer
or
crossing
themselves
thrice
they
throw
a
handful
of
wheat
on
the
chosen
oak
and
greet
it
with
the
words
happy
day
to
you
then
they
cut
it
down
taking
care
that
it
shall
fall
towards
the
east
at
the
moment
when
the
sun
s
orb
appears
over
the
rim
of
the
eastern
horizon
should
the
tree
fall
towards
the
west
it
would
be
the
worst
possible
omen
for
the
house
and
its
inmates
in
the
ensuing
year
and
it
is
also
an
evil
omen
if
the
tree
should
be
caught
and
stopped
in
its
fall
by
another
tree
it
is
important
to
keep
and
carry
home
the
first
chip
from
the
fallen
oak
the
trunk
is
sawn
into
two
or
three
logs
one
of
them
rather
longer
than
the
others
a
flat
unleavened
cake
of
the
purest
wheaten
flour
is
brought
out
of
the
house
and
broken
on
the
larger
of
the
logs
by
a
woman
the
logs
are
left
for
the
present
to
stand
outside
leaning
on
one
of
the
walls
of
the
house
each
of
them
is
called
a
yule
log
meanwhile
the
children
and
young
people
go
from
house
to
house
singing
special
songs
called
because
of
an
old
pagan
divinity
colleda
who
is
invoked
in
every
line
in
one
of
them
she
is
spoken
of
as
a
beautiful
little
maid
in
another
she
is
implored
to
make
the
cows
yield
milk
abundantly
the
day
is
spent
in
busy
preparations
the
women
bake
little
cakes
of
a
special
sort
in
the
shape
of
lambs
pigs
and
chickens
the
men
make
ready
a
pig
for
roasting
for
in
every
servian
house
roast
pig
is
the
principal
dish
at
christmas
a
bundle
of
straw
tied
with
a
rope
is
brought
into
the
courtyard
and
left
to
stand
there
near
the
yule
logs
at
the
moment
when
the
sun
is
setting
all
the
members
of
the
family
assemble
in
the
central
hall
the
great
family
kitchen
of
the
principal
house
the
mother
of
the
family
or
the
wife
of
the
chief
of
the
zadrooga
gives
a
pair
of
woollen
gloves
to
one
of
the
young
men
who
goes
out
and
presently
returns
carrying
in
his
gloved
hands
the
largest
of
the
logs
the
mother
receives
him
at
the
threshold
throwing
at
him
a
handful
of
wheat
in
which
the
first
chip
of
the
oak
tree
cut
in
the
early
morning
for
the
yule
log
has
been
kept
all
day
entering
the
central
hall
with
the
yule
log
the
young
man
greets
all
present
with
the
words
good
evening
and
may
you
have
a
happy
christmas
and
they
all
answer
in
chorus
may
god
and
the
happy
and
holy
christmas
help
thee
in
some
parts
of
servia
the
chief
of
the
family
holding
a
glass
of
red
wine
in
his
hand
greets
the
yule
log
as
if
it
were
a
living
person
and
drinks
to
its
health
after
that
another
glass
of
red
wine
is
poured
on
the
log
then
the
oldest
male
member
of
the
family
assisted
by
the
young
man
who
brought
in
the
log
places
it
on
the
burning
fire
so
that
the
thicker
end
of
the
log
protrudes
for
about
a
foot
from
the
hearth
in
some
places
this
end
is
smeared
with
honey
next
the
mother
of
the
family
brings
in
the
bundle
of
straw
which
was
left
standing
outside
all
the
young
children
arrange
themselves
behind
her
in
a
row
she
then
walks
slowly
round
the
hall
and
the
adjoining
rooms
throwing
handfuls
of
straw
on
the
floor
and
imitating
the
cackling
of
a
hen
while
all
the
children
follow
her
peeping
with
their
lips
as
if
they
were
chickens
cheeping
and
waddling
after
the
mother
bird
when
the
floor
is
well
strewn
with
straw
the
father
or
the
eldest
member
of
the
family
throws
a
few
walnuts
in
every
corner
of
the
hall
pronouncing
the
words
in
the
name
of
god
the
father
and
the
son
and
the
holy
ghost
amen
a
large
pot
or
a
small
wooden
box
filled
with
wheat
is
placed
high
in
the
east
corner
of
the
hall
and
a
tall
candle
of
yellow
wax
is
stuck
in
the
middle
of
the
wheat
then
the
father
of
the
family
reverently
lights
the
candle
and
prays
god
to
bless
the
family
with
health
and
happiness
the
fields
with
a
good
harvest
the
beehives
with
plenty
of
honey
the
cattle
and
sheep
with
young
and
the
cows
with
abundant
milk
and
rich
cream
after
that
they
all
sit
down
to
supper
squatting
on
the
floor
for
the
use
of
chairs
and
tables
is
forbidden
on
this
occasion
by
four
o
clock
next
morning
christmas
day
the
whole
village
is
astir
indeed
most
people
do
not
sleep
at
all
that
night
it
is
deemed
most
important
to
keep
the
yule
log
burning
brightly
all
night
long
very
early
too
the
pig
is
laid
on
the
fire
to
roast
and
at
the
same
moment
one
of
the
family
goes
out
into
the
yard
and
fires
a
pistol
or
gun
and
when
the
roast
pig
is
removed
from
the
fire
the
shot
is
repeated
hence
for
several
hours
in
the
early
morning
of
christmas
day
such
a
popping
and
banging
of
firearms
goes
on
that
a
stranger
might
think
a
stubborn
skirmish
was
in
progress
just
before
the
sun
rises
a
girl
goes
and
draws
water
at
the
village
spring
or
at
the
brook
before
she
fills
her
vessels
she
wishes
the
water
a
happy
christmas
and
throws
a
handful
of
wheat
into
it
the
first
cupfuls
of
water
she
brings
home
are
used
to
bake
a
special
christmas
cake
of
which
all
the
members
partake
at
dinner
and
portions
are
kept
for
absent
relatives
a
small
silver
coin
is
baked
in
the
cake
and
he
or
she
who
gets
it
will
be
lucky
during
the
year
all
the
family
gathered
round
the
blazing
yule
log
now
anxiously
expect
the
arrival
of
the
special
christmas
visiter
who
bears
the
title
of
he
is
usually
a
young
boy
of
a
friendly
family
no
other
person
not
even
the
priest
or
the
mayor
of
the
village
would
be
allowed
to
set
foot
in
the
house
before
the
arrival
of
this
important
personage
therefore
he
ought
to
come
and
generally
does
come
very
early
in
the
morning
he
carries
a
woollen
glove
full
of
wheat
and
when
the
door
is
opened
at
his
knock
he
throws
handfuls
of
wheat
on
the
family
gathered
round
the
hearth
greeting
them
with
the
words
christ
is
born
they
all
answer
he
is
born
indeed
and
the
hostess
flings
a
handful
of
wheat
over
the
christmas
visiter
who
moreover
casts
some
of
his
wheat
into
the
corners
of
the
hall
as
well
as
upon
the
people
then
he
walks
straight
to
the
hearth
takes
a
shovel
and
strikes
the
burning
log
so
that
a
cloud
of
sparks
flies
up
the
chimney
while
he
says
may
you
have
this
year
so
many
oxen
so
many
horses
so
many
sheep
so
many
pigs
so
many
beehives
full
of
honey
so
much
good
luck
prosperity
progress
and
happiness
having
uttered
these
good
wishes
he
embraces
and
kisses
his
host
then
he
turns
again
to
the
hearth
and
after
crossing
himself
falls
on
his
knees
and
kisses
the
projecting
part
of
the
yule
log
on
rising
to
his
feet
he
places
a
coin
on
the
log
as
his
gift
meanwhile
a
low
wooden
chair
has
been
brought
in
by
a
woman
and
the
visiter
is
led
to
it
to
take
his
seat
but
just
as
he
is
about
to
do
so
the
chair
is
jerked
away
from
under
him
by
a
male
member
of
the
family
and
he
measures
his
length
on
the
floor
by
this
fall
he
is
supposed
to
fix
into
the
ground
all
the
good
wishes
which
he
has
uttered
that
morning
the
hostess
thereupon
wraps
him
in
a
thick
blanket
and
he
sits
quietly
muffled
in
it
for
a
few
minutes
the
thick
blanket
in
which
he
is
swathed
is
believed
on
the
principles
of
homoeopathic
magic
to
ensure
that
the
cows
will
give
thick
cream
the
next
year
while
he
sits
thus
enriching
the
milk
of
the
dairy
the
lads
who
are
to
herd
the
sheep
in
the
coming
year
go
to
the
hearth
and
kneeling
down
before
it
kiss
each
other
across
the
projecting
end
of
the
yule
log
by
this
demonstration
of
affection
they
are
thought
to
seal
the
love
of
the
ewes
for
their
lambs
the
ritual
of
the
yule
log
is
observed
in
a
similar
form
by
the
servians
who
inhabit
the
southern
provinces
of
austria
thus
in
syrmia
a
district
of
slavonia
which
borders

sends
out
one
or
two

carries
it
into

and
lays
it
on

the
master
of
the
house
throws
corn
over
him
and
the
two
greet
each
other
solemnly
the
one
saying
christ
is
born
and
the
other
answering
he
is
born
later
in
the
evening
the
master
of
the
house
pours
a
glass
of
wine
on
the
charred
end
of
the
log
whereupon
one
of
the
younger
men
takes
the
burnt
piece
of
wood
carries
it
to
the
orchard
and
sets
it
up
against
one
of
the

this
service

is
rewarded
by
the
master
of

house
with
a
piece
of
money
on
christmas

when
the
family
is
assembled
at

they
expect
the
arrival
of
the
special
christmas
visiter
called
the
only
person
who
is
allowed
to
enter
the
house
that
day
when
he
comes
he
goes
to
the
hearth
stirs
the
fire
with
the
poker
and
says
christ
is
born
may
the
family
enjoy
all
good
luck
and
happiness
in
this
year
may
the
cattle
increase
in
number
like
the
sparks
i
have
struck
as
he
says
these
words
the
mistress
of
the
house
pours
corn
over
him
and
leads
him
to
the
parlour
where
he
takes
the
place
of
honour
beside
the
master
of
the
house
he
is
treated
with
marked
attention
and
respect
the
family
are
at
pains
to
entertain
him
they
sing
their
best
songs
for
his
amusement
and
after
midnight
a
numerous
band
of
men
and
maidens
escorts
him
by
torchlight
with
songs
and
jubilation
to
his
own
house
among
the
servians
of
dalmatia
herzegovina
and
montenegro
it
is
customary
on
christmas
eve
to
fetch
a
great
yule
log
which
serves
as
a
symbol
of
family
luck
it
is
generally
cut
from
an
evergreen
oak
but
sometimes
from
an
or
a
beech
at
nightfall
the
master
of
the
house
himself
brings
in
the
log
and
lays
it
on
the
fire
then
he
and
all
present
bare
their
heads
sprinkle
the
log
with
wine
and
make
a
cross
on
it
after
that
the
master
of
the
house
says
welcome
o
log
may
god
keep
you
from
mishap
so
saying
he
strews
peas
maize
raisins
and
wheat
on
the
log
praying
for
god
s
blessing
on
all
members
of
the
family
living
and
dead
for
heaven
s
blessing
on
their
undertakings
and
for
domestic
prosperity
in
montenegro
they
meet
the
log
with
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
jug
of
wine
drink
to
it
and
pour
wine
on
it
whereupon
the
whole
family
drinks
out
of
the
same
beaker
in
dalmatia
and
other
places
for
example
in
rizano
the
yule
logs
are
decked
by
young
women
with
red
silk
flowers
laurel
leaves
ribbons
and
even
gold
wire
and
the
lights
near
the
doorposts
are
kindled
when
the
log
is
brought
into
the
house
among
the
morlaks
as
soon
as
the
master
of
the
house
crosses
the
threshold
with
the
yule
log
one
of
the
family
must
sprinkle
corn
on
him
and
say
god
bless
you
to
which
he
answers
the
same
to
a
piece
of
the
log
is
kept
till
new
year
s
day
to
kindle
a
light
with
or
it
is
carried
out
to
the
fields
to
protect
them
from
hail
it
is
customary
to
invite
before
hand
a
christmas
visiter
and
to
admit
no
one
else
into
the
house
on
that
day
he
comes
early
carrying
in
his
sleeves
a
quantity
of
corn
which
he
throws
into
the
house
saying
christ
is
one
of
the
household
replies
he
is
born
indeed
and
throws
corn
on
the
visiter
then
the
newcomer
goes
up
to
the
hearth
pokes
the
fire
and
strikes
the
burning
log
with
the
poker
so
hard
that
sparks
fly
off
in
all
directions
at
each
blow
he
says
i
wish
the
family
as
many
cows
calves
sucking
pigs
goats
and
sheep
and
as
many
strokes
of
good
luck
as
the
sparks
that
now
fly
from
the
with
these
words
he
throws
some
small
coins
into
the
ashes
in
albania
down
to
recent
years
it
was
a
common
custom
to
burn
a
yule
log
at
christmas
and
with
it
corn
maize
and
beans
moreover
wine
and
were
poured
on
the
flames
and
the
ashes
of
the
fire
were
scattered
on
the
fields
to
make
them
fertile
the
huzuls
a
slavonic
people
of
the
carpathians
kindle
fire
by
the
friction
of
wood
on
christmas
eve
old
style
the
fifth
of
january
and
keep
it
burning
till
twelfth
night
it
is
remarkable
how
common
the
belief
appears
to
have
been
that
the
remains
of
the
if
kept
throughout
the
year
had
power
to
protect
the
house
against
fire
and
especially
against
lightning
as
the
yule
log
was
frequently
of
oak
it
seems
possible
that
this
belief
may
be
a
relic
of
the
old
aryan
creed
which
associated
the
with
the
god
of
thunder
whether
the
curative
and
fertilizing
virtues
ascribed
to
the
ashes
of
the
yule
log
which
are
supposed
to
heal
cattle
as
well
as
men
to
enable
cows
to
calve
and
to
promote
the
fruitfulness
of
the
earth
may
not
be
derived
from
the
same
ancient
source
is
a
question
which
deserves
to
be
considered
thus
far
we
have
regarded
only
the
private
or
domestic
celebration
of
the
at
midwinter
the
public
celebration
of
such
rites
at
that
season
of
the
year
appears
to
have
been
rare
and
exceptional
in
central
and
northern
europe
however
some
instances
are
on
record
thus
at
schweina
in
thuringia
down
to
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
young
people
used
to
kindle
a
great
bonfire
on
the
antonius
mountain
every
year
on
christmas
eve
neither
the
civil
nor
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
were
able
to
suppress
the
celebration
nor
could
the
cold
rain
and
snow
of
the
season
damp
or
chill
the
enthusiasm
of
the
celebrants
for
some
time
before
christmas
the
young
men
and
boys
were
busy
building
a
foundation
for
the
bonfire
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
where
the
oldest
church
of
the
village
used
to
stand
the
foundation
consisted
of
a
pyramidal
structure
composed
of
stones
turf
and
moss
when
christmas
eve
came
round
a
strong
pole
with
bundles
of
brushwood
tied
to
it
was
erected
on
the
pyramid
the
young
folk
also
provided
themselves
with
poles
to
which
old
brooms
or
faggots
of
shavings
were
attached
these
were
to
serve
as
torches
when
the
evening
grew
dark
and
the
church
bells
rang
to
service
the
troop
of
lads
ascended
the
mountain
and
soon
from
the
top
the
glare
of
the
bonfire
lit
up
the
darkness
and
the
sound
of
a
hymn
broke
the
stillness
of
night
in
a
circle
round
the
great
fire
lesser
fires
were
kindled
and
last
of
all
the
lads
ran
about
swinging
their
lighted
torches
till
these
twinkling
points
of
fire
moving
down
the
went
out
one
by
one
in
the
darkness
at
midnight
the
bells
rang
out
from
the
church
tower
mingled
with
the
blast
of
horns
and
the
sound
of
singing
feasting
and
revelry
were
kept
up
throughout
the
night
and
in
the
morning
young
and
old
went
to
early
mass
to
be
edified
by
hearing
of
the
light
eternal
in
the
bocage
of
normandy
the
peasants
used
to
repair
often
from
a
distance
of
miles
to
the
churches
to
hear
the
midnight
mass
on
christmas
eve
they
marched
in
procession
by
torchlight
chanting
christmas
carols
and
the
fitful
illumination
of
the
woods
the
hedges
and
the
fields
as
they
moved
through
the
darkness
presented
a
succession
of
picturesque
scenes
mention
is
also
made
of
bonfires
kindled
on
the
heights
the
custom
is
said
to
have
been
observed
at
athis
near
condé
down
to
recent
years
in
the
isle
of
man
on
the
of
december
a
day
dedicated
to
saint
thomas
the
people
went
to
the
mountains
to
catch
deer
and
sheep
for
christmas
and
in
the
evenings
always
kindled
a
large
fire
on
the
top
of
every
or
cliff
hence
at
the
time
of
casting
peats
every
one
laid
aside
a
large
one
saying
mooar
moayney
son
oie
l
that
is
a
large
turf
for
fingan
at
burghead
an
ancient
village
on
the
southern
shore
of
the
moray
firth
about
nine
miles
from
the
town
of
elgin
a
festival
of
fire
called
the
burning
of
the
clavie
has
been
celebrated
from
time
immemorial
on
hogmanay
the
last
day
of
december
a
is
sawn
in
two
one
half
of
it
is
set
on
the
top
of
a
stout
pole
and
filled
with
tar
and
other
combustibles
the
is
fastened
to
the
pole
by
means
of
a
long
nail
which
is
made
for
the
purpose
and
furnished
gratuitously
by
the
village
blacksmith
the
nail
must
be
knocked
in
with
a
stone
the
use
of
a
hammer
is
forbidden
when
the
shades
of
evening
have
begun
to
fall
the
clavie
as
it
is
called
is
set
on
fire
by
means
of
a
burning
peat
which
is
always
fetched
from
the
same
house
it
may
not
be
kindled
with
a
match
as
soon
as
it
is
in
a
blaze
it
is
shouldered
by
a
man
who
proceeds
to
carry
it
at
a
run
flaring
and
dripping
melted
tar
round
the
old
boundaries
of
the
village
the
modern
part
of
the
town
is
not
included
in
the
circuit
close
at
his
heels
follows
a
motley
crowd
cheering
and
shouting
one
bearer
relieves
another
as
each
wearies
of
his
burden
the
first
to
shoulder
the
clavie
which
is
esteemed
an
honour
is
usually
a
man
who
has
been
lately
married
should
the
bearer
stumble
or
fall
it
is
deemed
a
very
ill
omen
for
him
and
for
the
village
in
bygone
times
it
was
thought
necessary
that
one
man
should
carry
it
all
round
the
village
hence
the
strongest
man
was
chosen
for
the
purpose
moreover
it
was
customary
to
carry
the
burning
clavie
round
every
and
vessel
in
the
harbour
but
this
part
of
the
ceremony
was
afterwards
discontinued
finally
the
blazing
is
borne
to
a
small
hill
called
the
doorie
which
rises
near
the
northern
end
of
the
promontory
here
the
pole
is
fixed
into
a
socket
in
a
pillar
of
freestone
and
fresh
fuel
is
heaped
upon
the
flames
which
flare
up
higher
and
brighter
than
ever
formerly
the
clavie
was
allowed
to
burn
here
the
whole
night
but
now
after
blazing
for
about
half
an
hour
it
is
lifted
from
the
socket
and
thrown
down
the
western
slope
of
the
hill
then
the
crowd
rushes
upon
it
demolishes
it
and
scrambles
for
the
burning
smoking
embers
which
they
carry
home
and
carefully
preserve
as
charms
to
protect
them
against
witchcraft
and
misfortune
the
great
antiquity
of
burghead
where
this
curious
and
no
doubt
ancient
festival
is
still
annually
observed
appears
from
the
remains
of
a
very
remarkable
rampart
which
formerly
encircled
the
place
it
consists
of
a
mound
of
earth
faced
on
both
sides
with
a
solid
wall
of
stone
and
strengthened
internally
by
oak
beams
and
planks
the
whole
being
laid
on
a
foundation
of
boulders
the
style
of
the
rampart
agrees
in
general
with
caesar
s
description
of
the
mode
in
which
the
gauls
constructed
their
walls
of
earth
stone
and
logs
and
it
resembles
the
ruins
of
gallic
fortifications
which
have
been
discovered
in
france
though
it
is
said
to
surpass
them
in
the
strength
and
solidity
of
its
structure
no
similar
walls
appear
to
be
known
in
britain
a
great
part
of
this
interesting
prehistoric
fortress
was
barbarously
destroyed
in
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
much
of
it
being
tumbled
into
the
sea
and
many
of
the
stones
used
to
build
the
harbour
piers
in
lerwick
the
capital
of
the
shetland
islands
on
christmas
eve
the
fourth
of
january
the
old
style
is
still
children
go
that
is
to
say
they
disguising
themselves
in
the
most
fantastic
and
gaudy
costumes
parade
the
streets
and
infest
the
houses
and
shops
begging
for
the
wherewithal
to
carry
on
their
christmas
amusements
one
o
clock
on
yule
morning
having
struck
the
young
men
turn
out
in
large
numbers
dressed
in
the
coarsest
of
garments
and
at
the
march
drag
huge
tar
barrels
through
the
town
shouting
and
cheering
as
they
go
or
blowing
loud
blasts
with
their
louder
the
tar
barrel
simply
consists
of
from
four
to
filled
with
tar
and
chips
placed
on
a
platform
of
wood
it
is
dragged
by
means
of
a
chain
to
which
scores
of
jubilant
youths
readily
yoke
themselves
they
have
recently
been
described
by
the
worthy
burgh
officer
of
lerwick
as
fiery
chariots
the
effect
of
which
is
truly
grand
and
in
a
christmas
morning
the
dark
streets
of
lerwick
are
generally
lighted
up
by
the
bright
glare
and
its
atmosphere
blackened
by
the
dense
smoke
of
six
or
eight
tar
barrels
in
succession
on
the
appearance
of
daybreak
at
six
the
morning
revellers
put
off
their
coarse
begrimed
by
this
in
their
turn
become
guizards
they
assume
every
imaginable
form
of
of
soldiers
sailors
highlanders
spanish
chevaliers
etc
thus
disguised
they
either
go
in
pairs
as
man
and
wife
or
in
larger
groups
and
proceed
to
call
on
their
friends
to
wish
them
the
compliments
of
the
season
formerly
these
adolescent
guizards
used
to
seat
themselves
in
crates
and
accompanied
by
fiddlers
were
dragged
through
the
the
persians
used
to
celebrate
a
festival
of
fire
called
or
at
the
winter
solstice
on
the
longest
night
of
the
year
they
kindled
bonfires
everywhere
and
kings
and
princes
tied
dry
grass
to
the
feet
of
birds
and
animals
set
fire
to
the
grass
and
then
let
the
birds
and
beasts
fly
or
run
blazing
through
the
air
or
over
the
fields
and
mountains
so
that
the
whole
air
and
earth
appeared
to
be
on
fire
the
the
hitherto
described
are
all
celebrated
periodically
at
certain
stated
times
of
the
year
but
besides
these
regularly
recurring
celebrations
the
peasants
in
many
parts
of
europe
have
been
wont
from
time
immemorial
to
resort
to
a
ritual
of
fire
at
irregular
intervals
in
seasons
of
distress
and
calamity
above
all
when
their
cattle
were
attacked
by
epidemic
disease
no
account
of
the
popular
european
would
be
complete
without
some
notice
of
these
remarkable
rites
which
have
all
the
greater
claim
on
our
attention
because
they
may
perhaps
be
regarded
as
the
source
and
origin
of
all
the
other
certainly
they
must
date
from
a
very
remote
antiquity
the
general
name
by
which
they
are
known
among
the
teutonic
peoples
is
the
history
of
the
can
be
traced
back
to
the
early
middle
ages
for
in
the
reign
of
pippin
king
of
the
franks
the
practice
of
kindling
was
denounced
as
a
heathen
superstition
by
a
synod
of
prelates
and
nobles
held
under
the
presidency
of
boniface
archbishop
of
mainz
not
long
afterwards
the
custom
was
again
forbidden
along
with
many
more
relics
of
expiring
paganism
in
an
index
of
superstitions
and
heathenish
observances
which
has
been
usually
referred
to
the
year
though
some
scholars
assign
it
a
later
date
under
the
reign
of
charlemagne
in
germany
the
would
seem
to
have
been
popular
down
to
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
thus
in
the
year
when
a
fatal
was
raging
at
neustadt
near
marburg
a
wise
man
of
the
name
of
joh
köhler
induced
the
authorities
of
the
town
to
adopt
the
following
remedy
a
new
was
taken
and
twirled
round
an
axle
which
had
never
been
used
before
until
the
friction
elicited
fire
with
this
fire
a
bonfire
was
next
kindled
between
the
gates
of
the
town
and
all
the
cattle
were
driven
through
the
smoke
and
flames
moreover
every
householder
had
to
rekindle
the
fire
on
his
hearth
by
means
of
a
light
taken
from
the
bonfire
strange
to
say
this
salutary
measure
had
no
effect
whatever
in
staying
the
and
seven
years
later
the
sapient
joh
köhler
himself
was
burnt
as
a
witch
the
farmers
whose
pigs
and
cows
had
derived
no
benefit
from
the
perhaps
assisted
as
spectators
at
the
burning
and
while
they
shook
their
heads
agreed
among
themselves
that
it
served
joh
köhler
perfectly
right
according
to
a
writer
who
published
his
book
about
nine
years
afterwards
some
of
the
germans
especially
in
the
wassgaw
mountains
confidently
believed
that
a
could
be
stayed
by
driving
the
animals
through
a
which
had
been
kindled
by
the
violent
friction
of
a
pole
on
a
quantity
of
dry
oak
wood
but
it
was
a
necessary
condition
of
success
that
all
fires
in
the
village
should
previously
be
extinguished
with
water
and
any
householder
who
failed
to
put
out
his
fire
was
heavily
fined
the
method
of
kindling
the
is
described
as
follows
by
a
writer
towards
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
when
an
evil
plague
has
broken
out
among
the
cattle
large
and
small
and
the
herds
have
thereby
suffered
great
ravages
the
peasants
resolve
to
light
a
on
a
day
appointed
there
must
be
no
single
flame
in
any
house
nor
on
any
hearth
from
every
house
a
quantity
of
straw
and
water
and
underwood
must
be
brought
forth
then
a
strong
oaken
pole
is
fixed
firmly
in
the
earth
a
hole
is
bored
in
it
and
a
wooden
winch
well
smeared
with
pitch
and
tar
is
inserted
in
the
hole
and
turned
round
forcibly
till
great
heat
and
then
fire
is
generated
the
fire
so
produced
is
caught
in
fuel
and
fed
with
straw
heath
and
underwood
till
it
bursts
out
into
a
regular
which
must
then
be
somewhat
spread
out
between
walls
or
fences
and
the
cattle
and
horses
driven
through
it
twice
or
thrice
with
sticks
and
whips
others
set
up
two
posts
each
with
a
hole
in
it
and
insert
a
winch
along
with
old
greasy
rags
in
the
holes
others
use
a
thick
rope
collect
nine
kinds
of
wood
and
keep
them
in
violent
motion
till
fire
leaps
forth
perhaps
there
may
be
other
ways
of
generating
or
kindling
this
fire
but
they
are
all
directed
simply
at
the
cure
of
the
cattle
after
passing
twice
or
thrice
through
the
fire
the
cattle
are
driven
to
their
stalls
or
to
pasture
and
the
heap
of
wood
that
had
been
collected
is
destroyed
but
in
some
places
every
householder
must
take
with
him
a
brand
extinguish
it
in
a
or
trough
and
put
it
in
the
manger
where
the
cattle
are
fed
where
it
must
lie
for
some
time
the
poles
that
were
used
to
make
the
together
with
the
wood
that
was
employed
as
a
winch
are
sometimes
burned
with
the
rest
of
the
fuel
sometimes
carefully
preserved
after
the
cattle
have
been
thrice
driven
through
the
sometimes
the
was
known
as
the
wild
fire
to
distinguish
it
no
doubt
from
the
tame
fire
produced
by
more
ordinary
methods
the
following
is
grimm
s
account
of
the
mode
of
kindling
it
which
prevailed
in
some
parts
of
central
germany
particularly
about
hildesheim
down
apparently
to
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
many
places
of
lower
saxony
especially
among
the
mountains
the
custom
prevails
of
preparing
the
wild
fire
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
and
through
it
first
the
pigs
then
the
cows
and
last
of
all
the
geese
are
driven
the
proceedings
on
the
occasion
are
as
follows
the
principal
farmers
and
parishioners
assemble
and
notice
is
served
to
every
inhabitant
to
extinguish
entirely
all
fire
in
his
house
so
that
not
even
a
spark
remains
alight
in
the
whole
village
then
young
and
old
repair
to
a
road
in
a
hollow
usually
towards
evening
the
women
carrying
linen
and
the
men
wood
and
tow
two
oaken
poles
are
driven
into
the
ground
about
a
foot
and
a
half
from
each
other
each
pole
has
in
the
side
facing
the
other
a
socket
into
which
a
as
thick
as
a
man
s
arm
is
fitted
the
sockets
are
stuffed
with
linen
and
the
is
rammed
in
as
tight
as
possible
while
the
poles
are
bound
together
at
the
top
by
ropes
a
rope
is
wound
about
the
round
smooth
and
the
free
ends
of
the
rope
at
both
sides
are
gripped
by
several
persons
who
pull
the
to
and
fro
with
the
utmost
rapidity
till
through
the
friction
the
linen
in
the
sockets
takes
fire
the
sparks
of
the
linen
are
immediately
caught
in
tow
or
oakum
and
waved
about
in
a
circle
until
they
burst
into
a
bright
glow
when
straw
is
applied
to
it
and
the
flaming
straw
used
to
kindle
the
brushwood
which
has
been
stacked
in
piles
in
the
hollow
way
when
this
wood
has
blazed
up
and
the
fire
has
nearly
died
out
again
the
people
hasten
to
the
herds
which
have
been
waiting
in
the
background
and
drive
them
forcibly
one
after
the
other
through
the
glow
as
soon
as
all
the
beasts
are
through
the
young
folk
rush
wildly
at
the
ashes
and
cinders
sprinkling
and
blackening
each
other
with
them
those
who
have
been
most
sprinkled
and
blackened
march
in
triumph
behind
the
cattle
into
the
village
and
do
not
wash
themselves
for
a
long
time
if
after
long
rubbing
the
linen
should
not
catch
fire
they
guess
that
there
is
still
fire
somewhere
in
the
village
then
a
strict
search
is
made
from
house
to
house
any
fire
that
may
be
found
is
put
out
and
the
householder
is
punished
or
upbraided
the
wild
fire
must
be
made
by
prolonged
friction
it
may
not
be
struck
with
flint
and
steel
some
villages
do
not
prepare
it
yearly
as
a
preventive
of
but
only
kindle
it
when
the
disease
has
actually
broken
in
the
halberstadt
district
the
ends
of
the
rope
which
was
used
to
make
the
revolve
in
the
sockets
had
to
be
pulled
by
two
chaste
young
men
in
the
mark
down
to
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
practice
was
similar
we
read
that
in
many
parts
of
the
mark
there
still
prevails
on
certain
occasions
the
custom
of
kindling
a
it
happens
particularly
when
a
farmer
has
sick
pigs
two
posts
of
dry
wood
are
planted
in
the
earth
amid
solemn
silence
before
the
sun
rises
and
round
these
posts
hempen
ropes
are
pulled
to
and
fro
till
the
wood
kindles
whereupon
the
fire
is
fed
with
dry
leaves
and
twigs
and
the
sick
beasts
are
driven
through
it
in
some
places
the
fire
is
produced
by
the
friction
of
an
old
in
mecklenburg
the
used
to
be
lighted
by
the
friction
of
a
rope
wound
about
an
oaken
pole
or
by
rubbing
two
boards
against
each
other
having
been
thus
elicited
the
flame
was
fed
with
wood
of
seven
kinds
the
practice
was
forbidden
by
gustavus
adolphus
duke
of
mecklenburg
in
but
the
prohibition
apparently
had
little
effect
for
down
to
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
custom
was
so
common
that
the
inhabitants
even
of
large
towns
made
no
scruple
of
resorting
to
it
for
example
in
the
month
of
july
sickness
broke
out
among
the
cattle
belonging
to
the
town
of
sternberg
some
of
the
beasts
died
suddenly
and
so
the
people
resolved
to
drive
all
the
survivors
through
a
on
the
tenth
day
of
july
the
magistrates
issued
a
proclamation
announcing
that
next
morning
before
sunrise
a
would
be
kindled
for
the
behoof
of
all
the
cattle
of
the
town
and
warning
all
the
inhabitants
against
lighting
fires
in
their
kitchens
that
evening
so
next
morning
very
early
about
two
o
clock
nearly
the
whole
population
was
astir
and
having
assembled
outside
one
of
the
gates
of
the
town
they
helped
to
drive
the
timid
cattle
not
without
much
ado
through
three
separate
after
which
they
dispersed
to
their
homes
in
the
unalterable
conviction
that
they
had
rescued
the
cattle
from
destruction
but
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
they
deemed
it
advisable
to
administer
the
rest
of
the
ashes
as
a
bolus
to
the
animals
however
some
people
in
mecklenburg
used
to
strew
the
ashes
of
the
on
fields
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
crops
against
vermin
as
late
as
june
a
traveller
in
mecklenburg
saw
a
couple
of
peasants
sweating
away
at
a
rope
which
they
were
pulling
backwards
and
forwards
so
as
to
make
a
tarry
roller
revolve
with
great
speed
in
the
socket
of
an
upright
post
asked
what
they
were
about
they
vouchsafed
no
reply
but
an
old
woman
who
appeared
on
the
scene
from
a
neighbouring
cottage
was
more
communicative
in
the
fulness
of
her
heart
she
confided
to
the
stranger
that
her
pigs
were
sick
that
the
two
taciturn
bumpkins
were
her
sons
who
were
busy
extracting
a
from
the
roller
and
that
when
they
succeeded
the
flame
would
be
used
to
ignite
a
heap
of
rags
and
brushwood
through
which
the
ailing
swine
would
be
driven
she
further
explained
that
the
persons
who
kindle
a
should
always
be
two
brothers
or
at
least
bear
the
same
christian
name
in
the
summer
of
there
was
much
sickness
among
the
pigs
and
the
cows
of
eddesse
a
village
near
meinersen
in
the
south
of
hanover
when
all
ordinary
measures
to
arrest
the
malady
failed
the
farmers
met
in
solemn
conclave
on
the
village
green
and
determined
that
next
morning
there
should
be
a
thereupon
the
head
man
of
the
village
sent
word
from
house
to
house
that
on
the
following
day
nobody
should
kindle
a
fire
before
sunrise
and
that
everybody
should
stand
by
ready
to
drive
out
the
cattle
the
same
afternoon
all
the
necessary
preparations
were
made
for
giving
effect
to
the
decision
of
the
collective
wisdom
a
narrow
street
was
enclosed
with
planks
and
the
village
carpenter
set
to
work
at
the
machinery
for
kindling
the
fire
he
took
two
posts
of
oak
wood
bored
a
hole
about
three
inches
deep
and
broad
in
each
and
set
the
two
poles
up
facing
each
other
at
a
distance
of
about
two
feet
then
he
fitted
a
roller
of
oak
wood
into
the
two
holes
of
the
posts
so
that
it
formed
a
between
them
about
two
o
clock
next
morning
every
householder
brought
a
bundle
of
straw
and
brushwood
and
laid
it
down
across
the
street
in
a
prescribed
order
the
sturdiest
swains
who
could
be
found
were
chosen
to
make
the
for
this
purpose
a
long
hempen
rope
was
wound
twice
round
the
oaken
roller
in
the
oaken
posts
the
pivots
were
well
smeared
with
pitch
and
tar
a
bundle
of
tow
and
other
tinder
was
laid
close
at
hand
and
all
was
ready
the
stalwart
clodhoppers
now
seized
the
two
ends
of
the
rope
and
went
to
work
with
a
will
puffs
of
smoke
soon
issued
from
the
sockets
but
to
the
consternation
of
the
bystanders
not
a
spark
of
fire
could
be
elicited
some
people
openly
declared
their
suspicion
that
some
rascal
had
not
put
out
the
fire
in
his
house
when
suddenly
the
tinder
burst
into
flame
the
cloud
passed
away
from
all
faces
the
fire
was
applied
to
the
heaps
of
fuel
and
when
the
flames
had
somewhat
died
down
the
herds
were
forcibly
driven
through
the
fire
first
the
pigs
next
the
cows
and
last
of
all
the
horses
the
herdsmen
then
drove
the
beasts
to
pasture
and
persons
whose
faith
in
the
efficacy
of
the
was
particularly
robust
carried
home
brands
again
at
a
village
near
quedlinburg
in
the
harz
mountains
it
was
resolved
to
put
a
herd
of
sick
swine
through
the
hearing
of
this
intention
the
superintendent
of
quedlinburg
hurried
to
the
spot
and
has
described
for
us
what
he
saw
the
beadles
went
from
house
to
house
to
see
that
there
was
no
fire
in
any
house
for
it
is
well
known
that
should
there
be
common
fire
burning
in
a
house
the
will
not
kindle
the
men
made
their
rounds
very
early
in
the
morning
to
make
quite
sure
that
all
lights
were
out
at
two
o
clock
a
was
still
burning
in
the
parsonage
and
this
was
of
course
a
hindrance
to
the
the
peasants
knocked
at
the
window
and
earnestly
entreated
that
the
might
be
extinguished
but
the
parson
s
wife
refused
to
put
the
light
out
it
still
glimmered
at
the
window
and
in
the
darkness
outside
the
angry
rustics
vowed
that
the
parson
s
pigs
should
get
no
benefit
of
the
however
as
good
luck
would
have
it
just
as
the
morning
broke
the
went
out
of
itself
and
the
hopes
of
the
people
revived
from
every
house
bundles
of
straw
tow
faggots
and
so
forth
were
now
carried
to
feed
the
bonfire
the
noise
and
the
cheerful
bustle
were
such
that
you
might
have
thought
they
were
all
hurrying
to
witness
a
public
execution
outside
the
village
between
two
garden
walls
an
oaken
post
had
been
driven
into
the
ground
and
a
hole
bored
through
it
in
the
hole
a
wooden
winch
smeared
with
tar
was
inserted
and
made
to
revolve
with
such
force
and
rapidity
that
fire
and
smoke
in
time
issued
from
the
socket
the
collected
fuel
was
then
thrown
upon
the
fire
and
soon
a
great
blaze
shot
up
the
pigs
were
now
driven
into
the
upper
end
of
the
street
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
fire
they
turned
tail
but
the
peasants
drove
them
through
with
shrieks
and
shouts
and
lashes
of
whips
at
the
other
end
of
the
street
there
was
another
crowd
waiting
who
chased
the
swine
back
through
the
fire
a
second
time
then
the
other
crowd
repeated
the
manœuvre
and
the
herd
of
swine
was
driven
for
the
third
time
through
the
smoke
and
flames
that
was
the
end
of
the
performance
many
pigs
were
scorched
so
severely
that
they
gave
up
the
ghost
the
bonfire
was
broken
up
and
every
householder
took
home
with
him
a
brand
which
he
washed
in
the
and
laid
for
some
time
as
a
treasure
of
great
price
in
the
manger
from
which
the
cattle
were
fed
but
the
parson
s
wife
had
reason
bitterly
to
repent
her
folly
in
refusing
to
put
out
that
for
not
one
of
her
pigs
was
driven
through
the
so
they
died
in
brunswick
also
the
is
known
to
have
been
repeatedly
kindled
during
the
nineteenth
century
after
driving
the
pigs
through
the
fire
which
was
kindled
by
the
friction
of
wood
some
people
took
brands
home
dipped
them
in
water
and
then
gave
the
water
to
the
pigs
to
drink
no
doubt
for
the
purpose
of
inoculating
them
still
more
effectually
with
the
precious
virtue
of
the
in
the
villages
of
the
drömling
district
everybody
who
bore
a
hand
in
kindling
the
wild
fire
must
have
the
same
christian
name
otherwise
they
laboured
in
vain
the
fire
was
produced
by
the
friction
of
a
rope
round
the
beams
of
a
door
and
bread
corn
and
old
boots
contributed
their
mites
to
swell
the
blaze
through
which
the
pigs
as
usual
were
driven
in
one
place
apparently
not
far
from
wolfenbüttel
the
is
said
to
have
been
kindled
contrary
to
custom
by
the
smith
striking
a
spark
from
the
cold
anvil
at
gandersheim
down
to
about
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
was
lit
in
the
common
way
by
causing
a
to
revolve
rapidly
on
its
axis
between
two
upright
posts
the
rope
which
produced
the
revolution
of
the
bar
had
to
be
new
but
it
was
if
possible
woven
from
threads
taken
from
a
with
which
people
had
been
hanged
while
the
was
being
kindled
in
this
fashion
every
other
fire
in
the
town
had
to
be
put
out
search
was
made
through
the
houses
and
any
fire
discovered
to
be
burning
was
extinguished
if
in
spite
of
every
precaution
no
flame
could
be
elicited
by
the
friction
of
the
rope
the
failure
was
set
down
to
witchcraft
but
if
the
efforts
were
successful
a
bonfire
was
lit
with
the
new
fire
and
when
the
flames
had
died
down
the
sick
swine
were
driven
thrice
through
the
glowing
embers
on
the
lower
rhine
the
is
said
to
have
been
kindled
by
the
friction
of
on
all
fires
in
the
village
having
been
previously
extinguished
the
bonfires
so
kindled
were
composed
of
wood
of
nine
different
sorts
there
were
three
such
bonfires
and
the
cattle
were
driven
round
them
with
great
gravity
and
devotion
in
silesia
also
were
often
employed
for
the
purpose
of
curing
a
murrain
or
preventing
its
spread
while
all
other
lights
within
the
boundaries
were
extinguished
the
new
fire
was
produced
by
the
friction
of
nine
kinds
of
wood
and
the
flame
so
obtained
was
used
to
kindle
heaps
of
brushwood
or
straw
to
which
every
inhabitant
had
contributed
through
these
fires
the
cattle
both
sick
and
sound
were
driven
in
the
confident
expectation
that
thereby
the
sick
would
be
healed
and
the
sound
saved
from
sickness
when
plague
breaks
out
among
the
herds
at
dobischwald
in
austrian
silesia
a
splinter
of
wood
is
chipped
from
the
threshold
of
every
house
the
cattle
are
driven
to
a
and
there
a
tree
growing
at
the
boundary
is
felled
by
a
pair
of
twin
brothers
the
wood
of
the
tree
and
the
splinters
from
the
thresholds
furnish
the
fuel
of
a
bonfire
which
is
kindled
by
the
rubbing
of
two
pieces
of
wood
together
when
the
bonfire
is
ablaze
the
horns
of
the
cattle
are
pared
and
the
parings
thrown
into
the
flames
after
which
the
animals
are
driven
through
the
fire
this
is
believed
to
guard
the
herd
against
the
plague
the
germans
of
western
bohemia
resort
to
similar
measures
for
staying
a
murrain
you
set
up
a
post
bore
a
hole
in
it
and
insert
in
the
hole
a
stick
which
you
have
first
of
all
smeared
with
pitch
and
wrapt
in
inflammable
stuffs
then
you
wind
a
rope
round
the
stick
and
give
the
two
ends
of
the
rope
to
two
persons
who
must
either
be
brothers
or
have
the
same
baptismal
name
they
haul
the
rope
backwards
and
forwards
so
as
to
make
the
tarred
stick
revolve
rapidly
till
the
rope
first
smokes
and
then
emits
sparks
the
sparks
are
used
to
kindle
a
bonfire
through
which
the
cattle
are
driven
in
the
usual
way
and
as
usual
no
other
fire
may
burn
in
the
village
while
the
is
being
kindled
for
otherwise
the
rope
could
not
possibly
be
ignited
in
upper
austria
sick
pigs
are
reported
to
have
been
driven
through
a
about
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
is
still
in
use
in
some
parts
of
switzerland
but
it
seems
to
have
degenerated
into
a
children
s
game
and
to
be
employed
rather
for
the
dispersal
of
a
mist
than
for
the
prevention
or
cure
of
in
some
cantons
it
goes
by
the
name
of
while
in
others
it
is
called
on
a
misty
or
rainy
day
a
number
of
children
will
shut
themselves
up
in
a
stable
or
byre
and
proceed
to
make
fire
for
the
purpose
of
improving
the
weather
the
way
in
which
they
make
it
is
this
a
boy
places
a
board
against
his
breast
takes
a
peg
pointed
at
both
ends
and
setting
one
end
of
the
peg
against
the
board
on
his
breast
presses
the
other
end
firmly
against
a
second
board
the
surface
of
which
has
been
flaked
into
a
nap
a
string
is
tied
round
the
peg
and
two
other
boys
pull
it
to
and
fro
till
through
the
rapid
motion
of
the
point
of
the
peg
a
hole
is
burnt
in
the
flaked
board
to
which
tow
or
dry
moss
is
then
applied
as
a
tinder
in
this
way
fire
and
smoke
are
elicited
and
with
their
appearance
the
children
fancy
that
the
mist
will
vanish
we
may
conjecture
that
this
method
of
dispersing
a
mist
which
is
now
left
to
children
was
formerly
practised
in
all
seriousness
by
grown
men
in
switzerland
it
is
thus
that
religious
or
magical
rites
dwindle
away
into
the
sports
of
children
in
the
canton
of
the
grisons
there
is
still
in
common
use
an
imprecation

or
i

which
points
to
an
old
custom
of
burning
up
the
fog
with
fire
a
longer
form
of
the
curse

in
the

of
the

an

the
is
called
from
the
mode
of
its
production
either
turned
fire
or
rubbed
down
to
near
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
was
kindled
as
in
germany
by
the
violent
rubbing
of
two
pieces
of
wood
against
each
other
sometimes
nine
different
kinds
of
wood
were
used
for
the
purpose
the
smoke
of
the
fire
was
deemed
salutary
and
nets
were
fumigated
with
it
in
order
that
the
trees
might
bear
fruit
and
the
nets
catch
fish
cattle
were
also
driven
through
the
smoke
in
sundal
a
narrow
norwegian
valley
shut
in
on
both
sides
by
precipitous
mountains
there
lived
down
to
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
an
old
man
who
was
very
superstitious
he
set
in
the
river
driva
which
traverses
the
valley
and
he
caught
many
fish
both
in
spring
and
autumn
when
his
fishing
went
wrong
he
kindled
or
rubbed
fire
friction
fire
to
counteract
the
witchcraft
which
he
believed
to
be
the
cause
of
his
bad
luck
he
set
up
two
planks
near
each
other
bored
a
hole
in
each
inserted
a
pointed
rod
in
the
holes
and
twisted
a
long
cord
round
the
rod
then
he
pulled
the
cord
so
as
to
make
the
rod
revolve
rapidly
thus
by
reason
of
the
friction
he
at
last
drew
fire
from
the
wood
that
contented
him
for
he
believed
that
the
witchery
was
thus
rendered
powerless
and
that
good
luck
in
his
fishing
was
now
slavonic
peoples
hold
the
in
high
esteem
they
call
it
living
fire
and
attribute
to
it
a
healing
virtue
the
ascription
of
medicinal
power
to
fire
kindled
by
the
friction
of
wood
is
said
to
be
especially
characteristic
of
the
slavs
who
inhabit
the
carpathian
mountains
and
the
balkan
peninsula
the
mode
in
which
they
produce
the
differs
somewhat
in
different
places
thus
in
the
schar
mountains
of
servia
the
task
is
entrusted
to
a
boy
and
girl
between
eleven
and
fourteen
years
of
age
they
are
led
into
a
perfectly
dark
room
and
having
stripped
themselves
naked
kindle
the
fire
by
rubbing
two
rollers
of
lime
wood
against
each
other
till
the
friction
produces
sparks
which
are
caught
in
tinder
the
serbs
of
western
macedonia
drive
two
oaken
posts
into
the
ground
bore
a
round
hole
in
the
upper
end
of
each
insert
a
roller
of
lime
wood
in
the
holes
and
set
it
revolving
rapidly
by
means
of
a
cord
which
is
looped
round
the
roller
and
worked
by
a
bow
elsewhere
the
roller
is
put
in
motion
by
two
men
who
hold
each
one
end
of
the
cord
and
pull
it
backwards
and
forwards
forcibly
between
them
bulgarian
shepherds
sometimes
kindle
the
by
drawing
a
piece
of
lime
wood
to
and
fro
across
the
flat
surface
of
a
in
the
forest
but
in
the
neighbourhood
of
küstendil
in
bulgaria
the
is
kindled
by
the
friction
of
two
pieces
of
oak
wood
and
the
cattle
are
driven
through
it
in
many
districts
of
russia
also
living
fire
is
made
by
the
friction
of
wood
on
john
s
day
and
the
herds
are
driven
through
it
and
the
people
leap
over
it
in
the
conviction
that
their
health
is
thereby
assured
when
a
is
raging
the
fire
is
produced
by
rubbing
two
pieces
of
oak
wood
against
each
other
and
it
is
used
to
kindle
the
lamps
before
the
holy
pictures
and
the
censers
in
the
churches
thus
it
appears
that
in
russia
the
is
kindled
for
the
sake
of
the
cattle
periodically
as
well
as
on
special
emergencies
similarly
in
poland
the
peasants
are
said
to
kindle
fires
in
the
village
streets
on
rochus
s
day
and
to
drive
the
cattle
thrice
through
them
in
order
to
protect
the
animals
against
the
murrain
the
fire
is
produced
by
rubbing
a
pole
of
poplar
wood
on
a
plank
of
poplar
or
fir
wood
and
catching
the
sparks
in
tow
the
embers
are
carried
home
to
be
used
as
remedies
in
sickness
as
practised
in
slavonia
the
custom
of
the
used
to
present
some
interesting
features
which
are
best
described
in
the
words
of
an
in
the
year
i
came
for
the
first
time
as
a
young
merchant
to
slavonia
it
was
to
gaj
that
i
went
in
the
požega
district
the
time
was
autumn
and
it
chanced
that
a
was
raging
in
the
neighbourhood
which
inflicted
much
loss
on
the
people
the
peasants
believed
that
the
plague
was
a
woman
an
evil
spirit
who
was
destroying
the
cattle
so
they
sought
to
banish
her
i
had
then
occasion
to
observe
the
proceedings
in
the
villages
of
gaj
kukunjevac
brezina
and
brekinjska
towards
evening
the
whole
population
of
the
village
was
busy
laying
a
ring
of
brushwood
round
the
boundaries
of
the
village
all
fires
were
extinguished
throughout
the
village
then
pairs
of
men
in
several
places
took
pieces
of
wood
which
had
been
specially
prepared
for
the
purpose
and
rubbed
them
together
till
they
emitted
sparks
the
sparks
were
allowed
to
fall
on
tinder
and
fanned
into
a
flame
with
which
the
dry
brushwood
was
kindled
thus
the
fire
burned
all
round
the
village
the
peasants
persuaded
themselves
that
thereupon
must
take
her
this
last
account
leaves
no
doubt
as
to
the
significance
of
the
in
the
minds
of
slavonian
peasantry
they
regard
it
simply
as
a
barrier
interposed
between
their
cattle
and
the
evil
spirit
which
prowls
like
a
hungry
wolf
round
the
fold
and
can
like
a
wolf
be
kept
at
bay
by
fire
the
same
interpretation
of
the
comes
out
hardly
less
clearly
in
the
account
which
another
writer
gives
of
a
ceremony
witnessed
by
him
at
the
village
of
setonje
at
the
foot
of
the
homolje
mountains
in
the
great
forest
of
servia
an
epidemic
was
raging
among
the
children
and
the
was
resorted
to
as
a
means
of
staying
the
plague
it
was
produced
by
an
old
man
and
an
old
woman
in
the
first
of
the
ways
described
above
that
is
they
made
it
in
the
dark
by
rubbing
two
sticks
of
lime
wood
against
each
other
before
the
healing
virtue
of
the
fire
was
applied
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
two
old
women
performed
the
following
ceremony
both
bore
the
name
of
stana
from
the
verb
to
remain
standing
for
the
ceremony
could
not
be
successfully
performed
by
persons
of
any
other
name
one
of
them
carried
a
copper
kettle
full
of
water
the
other
an
old
with
the
key
thus
equipped
they
repaired
to
a
spot
outside
of
the
village
and
there
the
old
dame
with
the
kettle
asked
the
old
dame
with
the
lock
whither
away
and
the
other
answered
her
i
came
to
shut
the
village
against
with
that
she
locked
the
lock
and
threw
it
with
the
key
into
the
kettle
of
water
then
they
marched
thrice
round
the
village
repeating
the
ceremony
of
the
lock
and
key
at
each
round
meantime
all
the
villagers
arrayed
in
their
best
clothes
were
assembled
in
an
open
place
all
the
fires
in
the
houses
had
been
previously
extinguished
two
sturdy
yokels
now
dug
a
tunnel
through
a
mound
beside
an
oak
tree
the
tunnel
was
just
high
enough
to
let
a
man
creep
through
it
on
all
fours
two
fires
lit
by
the
were
now
laid
one
at
each
end
of
the
tunnel
and
the
old
woman
with
the
kettle
took
her
stand
at
the
entrance
of
the
tunnel
while
the
one
with
the
lock
posted
herself
at
the
exit
facing
the
latter
stood
another
woman
with
a
great
pot
of
milk
before
her
and
on
the
other
side
was
set
a
pot
full
of
melted
swine
s
fat
all
was
now
ready
the
villagers
thereupon
crawled
through
the
tunnel
on
hands
and
knees
one
behind
the
other
each
as
he
emerged
from
the
tunnel
received
a
spoonful
of
milk
from
the
woman
and
looked
at
his
face
reflected
in
the
pot
of
melted
swine
s
fat
then
another
woman
made
a
cross
with
a
piece
of
charcoal
on
his
back
when
all
the
inhabitants
had
thus
crept
through
the
tunnel
and
been
doctored
at
the
other
end
each
took
some
glowing
embers
home
with
him
in
a
pot
wherewith
to
rekindle
the
fire
on
the
domestic
hearth
lastly
they
put
some
of
the
charcoal
in
a
vessel
of
water
and
drank
the
mixture
in
order
to
be
thereby
magically
protected
against
the
epidemic
it
would
be
superfluous
to
point
out
in
detail
how
admirably
these
measures
are
calculated
to
arrest
the
ravages
of
disease
but
for
the
sake
of
those
if
there
are
any
to
whom
the
medicinal
effect
of
crawling
through
a
hole
on
hands
and
knees
is
not
at
once
apparent
i
shall
merely
say
that
the
procedure
in
question
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
specifics
which
the
wit
of
man
has
devised
for
maladies
of
all
sorts
ample
evidence
of
its
application
will
be
adduced
in
a
later
part
of
this
work
in
bulgaria
the
herds
suffer
much
from
the
raids
of
certain
vampyres
called
an
is
the
spirit
of
a
christian
child
who
was
born
on
a
saturday
and
died
unfortunately
before
he
could
be
baptized
on
the
ninth
day
after
burial
he
grubs
his
way
out
of
the
grave
and
attacks
the
cattle
at
once
sucking
their
blood
all
night
and
returning
at
peep
of
dawn
to
the
grave
to
rest
from
his
labours
in
ten
days
or
so
the
copious
draughts
of
blood
which
he
has
swallowed
have
so
fortified
his
constitution
that
he
can
undertake
longer
journeys
so
when
he
falls
in
with
great
herds
of
cattle
or
flocks
of
sheep
he
returns
no
more
to
the
grave
for
rest
and
refreshment
at
night
but
takes
up
his
quarters
during
the
day
either
between
the
horns
of
a
sturdy
calf
or
ram
or
between
the
hind
legs
of
a
beasts
whose
blood
he
has
sucked
die
the
same
night
in
any
herd
that
he
may
fasten
on
he
begins
with
the
fattest
animal
and
works
his
way
down
steadily
through
the
leaner
kine
till
not
one
single
beast
is
left
alive
the
carcases
of
the
victims
swell
up
and
when
the
hide
is
stripped
off
you
can
always
perceive
the
livid
patch
of
flesh
where
the
monster
sucked
the
blood
of
the
poor
creature
in
a
single
night
he
may
by
working
hard
kill
five
cows
but
he
seldom
exceeds
that
number
he
can
change
his
shape
and
weight
very
easily
for
example
when
he
is
sitting
by
day
between
the
horns
of
a
ram
the
animal
scarcely
feels
his
weight
but
at
night
he
will
sometimes
throw
himself
on
an
ox
or
a
cow
so
heavily
that
the
animal
can
not
stir
and
lows
so
pitifully
that
it
would
make
your
heart
bleed
to
hear
people
who
were
born
on
a
saturday
can
see
these
monsters
and
they
have
described
them
accurately
so
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
about
their
existence
it
is
therefore
a
matter
of
great
importance
to
the
peasant
to
protect
his
flocks
and
herds
against
the
ravages
of
such
dangerous
vampyres
the
way
in
which
he
does
so
is
this
on
a
saturday
morning
before
sunrise
the
village
drummer
gives
the
signal
to
put
out
every
fire
in
the
village
even
smoking
is
forbidden
next
all
the
domestic
animals
with
the
exception
of
fowls
geese
and
ducks
are
driven
out
into
the
open
in
front
of
the
flocks
and
herds
march
two
men
whose
names
during
the
ceremony
may
not
be
mentioned
in
the
village
they
go
into
the
wood
pick
two
dry
branches
and
having
stript
themselves
of
their
clothes
they
rub
the
two
branches
together
very
hard
till
they
catch
fire
then
with
the
fire
so
obtained
they
kindle
two
bonfires
one
on
each
side
of
a
which
is
known
to
be
frequented
by
wolves
after
that
the
herd
is
driven
between
the
two
fires
coals
from
the
bonfires
are
then
taken
back
to
the
village
and
used
to
rekindle
the
fires
on
the
domestic
hearths
for
several
days
no
one
may
go
near
the
charred
and
blackened
remains
of
the
bonfires
at
the
the
reason
is
that
the
vampyre
is
lying
there
having
dropped
from
his
seat
between
the
cow
s
horns
when
the
animals
were
driven
between
the
two
fires
so
if
any
one
were
to
pass
by
the
spot
during
these
days
the
monster
would
be
sure
to
call
him
by
name
and
to
follow
him
to
the
village
whereas
if
he
is
left
alone
a
wolf
will
come
at
midnight
and
strangle
him
and
in
a
few
days
the
herdsmen
can
see
the
ground
soaked
with
his
slimy
blood
so
that
is
the
end
of
the
vampyre
in
this
bulgarian
custom
as
in
the
slavonian
custom
described
above
the
conception
of
the
as
a
barrier
set
up
between
the
cattle
and
a
dangerous
spirit
is
clearly
worked
out
the
spirit
rides
the
cow
till
he
comes
to
the
narrow
pass
between
the
two
fires
but
the
heat
there
is
too
much
for
him
he
drops
in
a
faint
from
the
saddle
or
rather
from
the
horns
and
the
now
riderless
animal
escapes
safe
and
sound
beyond
the
smoke
and
flame
leaving
her
persecutor
prostrate
on
the
ground
on
the
further
side
of
the
blessed
barrier
in
bosnia
and
herzegovina
there
are
some
local
differences
in
the
mode
of
kindling
the
or
living
fire
as
it
is
called
thus
at
jablanica
both
the
uprights
and
the
roller
or
which
by
its
revolution
kindles
the
fire
are
made
of
wood
whereas
at
dolac
near
sarajevo
the
uprights
and
the
or
roller
are
all
made
of
lime
wood
in
gacko
contrary
to
the
usual
custom
the
fire
is
made
by
striking
a
piece
of
iron
on
an
anvil
till
sparks
are
given
out
which
are
caught
in
tinder
the
living
fire
thus
produced
is
employed
for
purposes
of
healing
in
particular
if
any
one
suffers
from
wounds
or
sores
ashes
of
the
are
sprinkled
on
the
ailing
part
in
gacko
it
is
also
believed
that
if
a
pregnant
woman
witnesses
a
conflagration
her
child
will
either
be
born
with
a
red
eruption
on
its
skin
or
will
contract
the
malady
sooner
or
later
afterwards
the
only
remedy
consists
in
ashes
of
the
which
are
mixed
with
water
and
given
to
the
child
to
drink
in
england
the
earliest
notice
of
the
seems
to
be
contained
in
the
chronicle
of
lanercost
for
the
year
the
annalist
tells
with
pious
horror
how
when
an
epidemic
was
raging
in
that
year
among
the
cattle
certain
beastly
men
monks
in
garb
but
not
in
mind
taught
the
idiots
of
their
country
to
make
fire
by
the
friction
of
wood
and
to
set
up
an
image
of
priapus
whereby
they
thought
to
succour
the
the
use
of
the
is
particularly
attested
for
the
counties
of
yorkshire
and
northumberland
thus
in
yorkshire
down
to
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
favourite
remedy
of
the
country
people
not
only
in
the
way
of
cure
but
of
prevention
was
an
odd
one
it
was
to
smoke
the
cattle
almost
to
suffocation
by
kindling
straw
litter
and
other
combustible
matter
about
them
the
effects
of
this
mode
of
cure
are
not
stated
but
the
most
singular
part
of
it
was
that
by
which
it
was
reported
to
have
been
discovered
an
angel
says
the
legend
descended
into
yorkshire
and
there
set
a
large
tree
on
fire
the
strange
appearance
of
which
or
else
the
savour
of
the
smoke
incited
the
cattle
around
some
of
which
were
infected
to
draw
near
the
miracle
when
they
all
either
received
an
immediate
cure
or
an
absolute
prevention
of
the
disorder
it
is
not
affirmed
that
the
angel
staid
to
speak
to
anybody
but
only
that
he
left
a
direction
for
the
neighbouring
people
to
catch
this
supernatural
fire
and
to
communicate
it
from
one
to
another
with
all
possible
speed
throughout
the
country
and
in
case
it
should
be
extinguished
and
utterly
lost
that
then
new
fire
of
equal
virtue
might
be
obtained
not
by
any
common
method
but
by
rubbing
two
pieces
of
wood
together
till
they
ignited
upon
what
foundation
this
story
stood
is
not
exactly
known
but
it
put
the
farmers
actually
into
a
hurry
of
communicating
flame
and
smoke
from
one
house
to
another
with
wonderful
speed
making
it
run
like
wildfire
over
the
again
we
read
that
the
father
of
the
writer
who
died
in
in
his
year
had
a
perfect
remembrance
of
a
great
number
of
persons
belonging
to
the
upper
and
middle
classes
of
his
native
parish
of
bowes
assembling
on
the
banks
of
the
river
greta
to
work
for
a
disease
among
cattle
called
the
murrain
then
prevailed
to
a
very
great
extent
through
that
district
of
yorkshire
the
cattle
were
made
to
pass
through
the
smoke
raised
by
this
miraculous
fire
and
their
cure
was
looked
upon
as
certain
and
to
neglect
doing
so
was
looked
upon
as
wicked
this
fire
was
produced
by
the
violent
and
continued
friction
of
two
dry
pieces
of
wood
until
such
time
as
it
was
thereby
obtained
to
work
as
though
one
was
working
for
is
a
common
proverb
in
the
north
of
at
ingleton
a
small
town
nestling
picturesquely
at
the
foot
of
the
high
hill
of
ingleborough
in
western
yorkshire
within
the
last
thirty
years
or
so
it
was
a
common
practice
to
kindle
the
by
rubbing
two
pieces
of
wood
briskly
together
and
setting
ablaze
a
large
heap
of
sticks
and
brushwood
which
were
dispersed
and
cattle
then
driven
through
the
smoking
brands
this
was
thought
to
act
as
a
charm
against
the
spread
or
developement
of
the
various
ailments
to
which
cattle
are
liable
and
the
farmers
seem
to
have
had
great
faith
in
writing
about
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
kemble
tells
us
that
the
or
had
been
used
in
devonshire
for
the
purpose
of
staying
a
murrain
within
the
memory
of
man
so
in
northumberland
down
to
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
when
a
contagious
disease
enters
among
cattle
the
fires
are
extinguished
in
the
adjacent
villages
two
pieces
of
dried
wood
are
then
rubbed
together
until
fire
be
produced
with
this
a
quantity
of
straw
is
kindled
juniper
is
thrown
into
the
flame
and
the
cattle
are
repeatedly
driven
through
the
smoke
part
of
the
forced
fire
is
sent
to
the
neighbours
who
again
forward
it
to
others
and
as
great
expedition
is
used
the
fires
may
be
seen
blazing
over
a
great
extent
of
country
in
a
very
short
space
of
it
is
strange
says
the
antiquary
william
henderson
writing
about
to
find
the
custom
of
lighting
on
the
occasion
of
epidemics
among
cattle
still
lingering
among
us
but
so
it
is
the
vicar
of
stamfordham
writes
thus
respecting
it
when
the
murrain
broke
out
among
the
cattle
about
eighteen
years
ago
this
fire
was
produced
by
rubbing
two
pieces
of
dry
wood
together
and
was
carried
from
place
to
place
all
through
this
district
as
a
charm
against
cattle
taking
the
disease
bonfires
were
kindled
with
it
and
the
cattle
driven
into
the
smoke
where
they
were
left
for
some
time
many
farmers
hereabouts
i
am
informed
had
the
in
the
earliest
systematic
account
of
the
western
islands
of
scotland
we
read
that
the
inhabitants
here
did
also
make
use
of
a
fire
called
a
forced
fire
or
fire
of
necessity
which
they
used
as
an
antidote
against
the
plague
or
murrain
in
cattle
and
it
was
performed
thus
all
the
fires
in
the
parish
were
extinguished
and
then
married
men
being
thought
the
necessary
number
for
effecting
this
design
took
two
great
planks
of
wood
and
nine
of
them
were
employed
by
turns
who
by
their
repeated
efforts
rubbed
one
of
the
planks
against
the
other
until
the
heat
thereof
produced
fire
and
from
this
forced
fire
each
family
is
supplied
with
new
fire
which
is
no
sooner
kindled
than
a
pot
full
of
water
is
quickly
set
on
it
and
afterwards
sprinkled
upon
the
people
infected
with
the
plague
or
upon
the
cattle
that
have
the
murrain
and
this
they
all
say
they
find
successful
by
experience
it
was
practised
in
the
main
land
opposite
to
the
south
of
skie
within
these
thirty
in
the
island
of
mull
one
of
the
largest
of
the
hebrides
the
was
kindled
as
late
as
in
consequence
of
a
disease
among
the
black
cattle
the
people
agreed
to
perform
an
incantation
though
they
esteemed
it
a
wicked
thing
they
carried
to
the
top
of
cammoor
a
wheel
and
nine
spindles
of
oakwood
they
extinguished
every
fire
in
every
house
within
sight
of
the
hill
the
wheel
was
then
turned
from
east
to
west
over
the
nine
spindles
long
enough
to
produce
fire
by
friction
if
the
fire
were
not
produced
before
noon
the
incantation
lost
its
effect
they
failed
for
several
days
running
they
attributed
this
failure
to
the
obstinacy
of
one
householder
who
would
not
let
his
fires
be
put
out
for
what
he
considered
so
wrong
a
purpose
however
by
bribing
his
servants
they
contrived
to
have
them
extinguished
and
on
that
morning
raised
their
fire
they
then
sacrificed
a
heifer
cutting
in
pieces
and
burning
while
yet
alive
the
diseased
part
they
then
lighted
their
own
hearths
from
the
pile
and
ended
by
feasting
on
the
remains
words
of
incantation
were
repeated
by
an
old
man
from
morven
who
came
over
as
master
of
the
ceremonies
and
who
continued
speaking
all
the
time
the
fire
was
being
raised
this
man
was
living
a
beggar
at
bellochroy
asked
to
repeat
the
spell
he
said
the
sin
of
repeating
it
once
had
brought
him
to
beggary
and
that
he
dared
not
say
those
words
again
the
whole
country
believed
him
from
this
account
we
see
that
in
mull
the
kindling
of
the
as
a
remedy
for
cattle
disease
was
accompanied
by
the
sacrifice
of
one
of
the
diseased
animals
and
though
the
two
customs
are
for
the
most
part
mentioned
separately
by
our
authorities
we
may
surmise
that
they
were
often
perhaps
usually
practised
together
for
the
purpose
of
checking
the
ravages
of
sickness
in
the
herds
in
the
county
of
caithness
forming
the
extreme
corner
of
the
mainland
of
scotland
the
practice
of
the
survived
down
at
least
to
about
we
read
that
in
those
days
when
the
stock
of
any
considerable
farmer
was
seized
with
the
murrain
he
would
send
for
one
of
the
to
superintend
the
raising
of
a
it
was
done
by
friction
thus
upon
any
small
island
where
the
stream
of
a
river
or
burn
ran
on
each
side
a
circular
booth
was
erected
of
stone
and
turf
as
it
could
be
had
in
which
a
semicircular
or
highland
couple
of
birch
or
other
hard
wood
was
set
and
in
short
a
roof
closed
on
it
a
straight
pole
was
set
up
in
the
centre
of
this
building
the
upper
end
fixed
by
a
wooden
pin
to
the
top
of
the
couple
and
the
lower
end
in
an
oblong
in
the
earth
or
floor
and
lastly
another
pole
was
set
across
horizontally
having
both
ends
tapered
one
end
of
which
was
supported
in
a
hole
in
the
side
of
the
perpendicular
pole
and
the
other
in
a
similar
hole
in
the
couple
leg
the
horizontal
stick
was
called
the
auger
having
four
short
arms
or
levers
fixed
in
its
centre
to
work
it
by
the
building
having
been
thus
finished
as
many
men
as
could
be
collected
in
the
vicinity
being
divested
of
all
kinds
of
metal
in
their
clothes
etc
would
set
to
work
with
the
said
auger
two
after
two
constantly
turning
it
round
by
the
arms
or
levers
and
others
occasionally
driving
wedges
of
wood
or
stone
behind
the
lower
end
of
the
upright
pole
so
as
to
press
it
the
more
on
the
end
of
the
auger
by
this
constant
friction
and
pressure
the
ends
of
the
auger
would
take
fire
from
which
a
fire
would
be
instantly
kindled
and
thus
the
would
be
accomplished
the
fire
in
the
farmer
s
house
was
immediately
quenched
with
water
a
fire
kindled
from
this
both
in
the
and
offices
and
the
cattle
brought
to
feel
the
smoke
of
this
new
and
sacred
fire
which
preserved
them
from
the
the
last
recorded
case
of
the
in
caithness
happened
in
or
at
houstry
dunbeath
a
crofter
named
david
gunn
had
made
for
himself
a
and
in
doing
so
had
wilfully
encroached
on
one
of
those
prehistoric
ruins
called
which
the
people
of
the
neighbourhood
believed
to
be
a
fairy
habitation
soon
afterwards
a
murrain
broke
out
among
the
cattle
of
the
district
and
carried
off
many
beasts
so
the
wise
men
put
their
heads
together
and
resolved
to
light
a
or
as
the
best
way
of
stopping
the
plague
they
cut
a
branch
from
a
tree
in
a
neighbouring
wood
stripped
it
of
bark
and
carried
it
to
a
small
island
in
the
houstry
burn
every
fire
in
the
district
having
been
quenched
new
fire
was
made
by
the
friction
of
wood
in
the
island
and
from
this
sacred
flame
all
the
hearths
of
the
houses
were
lit
afresh
one
of
the
sticks
used
in
making
the
fire
was
preserved
down
to
about
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
apparently
the
mode
of
operation
was
the
one
known
as
the
a
pointed
stick
was
twirled
in
a
hole
made
in
another
stick
till
fire
was
elicited
by
the
friction
another
account
of
the
use
of
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
runs
as
follows
when
by
the
neglect
of
the
prescribed
safeguards
against
witchcraft
the
seeds
of
iniquity
have
taken
root
and
a
person
s
means
are
decaying
in
consequence
the
only
alternative
in
this
case
is
to
resort
to
that
grand
remedy
the
or
forlorn
fire
which
seldom
fails
of
being
productive
of
the
best
effects
the
cure
for
witchcraft
called

wrought
in
the
following
manner
consultation
being
held
by
the
unhappy
sufferer
and
his
friends
as
to
the
most
advisable
measures
of
effecting
a
cure
if
this
process
is
adopted
notice
is
privately
communicated
to
all
those
householders
who
reside
within
the
nearest
of
two
running
streams
to
extinguish
their
lights
and
fires
on
some
appointed
morning
on
its
being
ascertained
that
this
notice
has
been
duly
observed
a
or
some
other
convenient
instrument
calculated
to
produce
fire
by
friction
is
set
to
work
with
the
most
furious
earnestness
by
the
unfortunate
sufferer
and
all
who
wish
well
to
his
cause
relieving
each
other
by
turns
they
drive
on
with
such
persevering
diligence
that
at
length
the
spindle
of
the
wheel
ignited
by
excessive
friction
emits
forlorn
fire
in
abundance
which
by
the
application
of
tow
or
some
other
combustible
material
is
widely
extended
over
the
whole
neighbourhood
communicating
the
fire
to
the
tow
the
tow
communicates
it
to
a
candle
the
candle
to
a
the
torch
to
a
cartful
of
peats
which
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
with
pious
ejaculations
for
the
success
of
the
experiment
distributes
to
messengers
who
will
proceed
with
portions
of
it
to
the
different
houses
within
the
said
two
running
streams
to
kindle
the
different

a
native
of

says
my
father
was
the
skipper
of
a
fishing
crew
before
beginning
operations
for
the
season
the
crew
of
the
boat
met
at
night
in
our
house
to
settle
accounts
for
the
past
and
to
plan
operations
for
the
new
season
my
mother
and
the
rest
of
us
were
sent
to
bed
i
lay
in
the
kitchen
and
was
listening
and
watching
though
they
thought
i
was
asleep
after
the
men
had
settled
their
past
affairs
and
future
plans
they
put
out
the
fire
on
the
hearth
not
a
spark
being
allowed
to
live
they
then
rubbed
two
pieces
of
wood
one
against
another
so
rapidly
as
to
produce
fire
the
men
joining
in
one
after
the
other
and
working
with
the
utmost
energy
and
never
allowing
the
friction
to
relax
from
this
they
rekindled
the
fire
on
the
hearth
from
which
all
the
men
present
carried
away
a
kindling
to
their
own
homes
whether
their
success
was
due
to
their
skill
their
industry
their
perseverance
or
to
the
i
do
not
know
but
i
know
that
they
were
much
the
most
successful
crew
in
the
place
they
met
on
saturday
and
went
to
church
on
sunday
like
the
good
men
and
the
good
christians
they
little
of
their
pagan
faith
mingling
with
their
christian
belief
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
other
crews
in
the
place
as
well
as
my
father
s
crew
practised
the
a
man
at

his
boyhood

in
north
uist
about
the
year
in
arran
about
in
helmsdale
about
in
reay
about
from
the
foregoing
account
we
learn
that
in
arran
the
annual
beltane
fire
was
regularly
made
by
the
friction
of
wood
and
that
it
was
used
to
protect
men
and
cattle
against
a
great
witch
when
we
remember
that
beltane
eve
or
the
eve
of
may
day
walpurgis
night
is
the
great
witching
time
of
the
year
throughout
europe
we
may
surmise
that
wherever
bonfires
have
been
ceremonially
kindled
on
that
day
it
has
been
done
simply
as
a
precaution
against
witchcraft
indeed
this
motive
is
expressly
alleged
not
only
in
scotland
but
in
wales
the
isle
of
man
and
many
parts
of
central
europe
it
deserves
further
to
be
noticed
that
in
north
uist
the
wood
used
to
kindle
the
was
oak
and
that
the
nine
times
nine
men
by
whose
exertions
the
flame
was
elicited
were
all
sons
apparently
the
son
of
a
family
was
thought
to
be
endowed
with
more
magical
virtue
than
his
younger
brothers
similarly
in
the
punjaub
the
supernatural
power
ascribed
to
the
first
born
is
not
due
to
his
being
unlucky
but
the
idea
underlying
the
belief
seems
to
be
that
being
the
first
product
of
the
parents
he
inherits
the
spiritual
powers
or
magnetism
in
a
high
degree
the
success
of
such
persons
in
stopping
rain
and
hail
and
in
stupefying
snakes
is
proverbial
it
is
believed
that
a
first
child
born
with
feet
forward
can
cure
backache
by
kicking
the
patient
in
the
back
on
a
in
the
of
aberdeenshire
and
the
neighbourhood
when
the
known
as
the
broke
out
the
muckle
wheel
was
set
in
motion
and
turned
till
fire
was
produced
from
this
virgin
flame
fires
were
kindled
in
the
byres
at
the
same
time
if
neighbours
requested
the
favour
live
coals
were
given
them
to
kindle
fires
for
the
purification
of
their
homesteads
and
turning
off
the
disease
fumigating
the
byres
with
juniper
was
a
method
adopted
to
ward
off
disease
such
a
fire
was
called
the
kindling
of
it
came
under
the
censure
of
the
presbytery
at
in
perthshire
the
was
kindled
as
a
remedy
for
as
late
as
a
wealthy
old
farmer
having
lost
several
of
his
cattle
by
some
disease
very
prevalent
at
present
and
being
able
to
account
for
it
in
no
way
so
rationally
as
by
witchcraft
had
recourse
to
the
following
remedy
recommended
to
him
by
a
weird
sister
in
his
neighbourhood
as
an
effectual
protection
from
the
attacks
of
the
foul
fiend
a
few
stones
were
piled
together
in
the
barnyard
and
woodcoals
having
been
laid
thereon
the
fuel
was
ignited
by
that
is
fire
obtained
by
friction
the
neighbours
having
been
called
in
to
witness
the
solemnity
the
cattle
were
made
to
pass
through
the
flames
in
the
order
of
their
dignity
and
age
commencing
with
the
horses
and
ending
with
the
swine
the
ceremony
having
been
duly
and
decorously
gone
through
a
neighbouring
farmer
observed
to
the
enlightened
owner
of
the
herd
that
he
along
with
his
family
ought
to
have
followed
the
example
of
the
cattle
and
the
sacrifice
to
baal
would
have
been
in
county
leitrim
ireland
in
order
to
prevent
fever
from
spreading
all
the
fires
on
the
townland
and
the
two
adjoining
one
on
each
side
would
be
put
out
then
the
men
of
the
three
townlands
would
come
to
one
house
and
get
two
large
blocks
of
wood
one
would
be
set
in
the
ground
and
the
other
one
fitted
with
two
handles
placed
on
the
top
of
it
the
men
would
then
draw
the
upper
block
backwards
and
forwards
over
the
lower
until
fire
was
produced
by
friction
and
from
this
the
fires
would
be
lighted
again
this
would
prevent
the
fever
from
thus
it
appears
that
in
many
parts
of
europe
it
has
been
customary
to
kindle
fire
by
the
friction
of
wood
for
the
purpose
of
curing
or
preventing
the
spread
of
disease
particularly
among
cattle
the
mode
of
striking
a
light
by
rubbing
two
dry
sticks
against
each
other
is
the
one
to
which
all
over
the
world
savages
have
most
commonly
resorted
for
the
sake
of
providing
themselves
with
fire
and
we
can
scarcely
doubt
that
the
practice
of
kindling
the
in
this
primitive
fashion
is
merely
a
survival
from
the
time
when
our
savage
forefathers
lit
all
their
fires
in
that
way
nothing
is
so
conservative
of
old
customs
as
religious
or
magical
ritual
which
invests
these
relics
of
the
past
with
an
atmosphere
of
mysterious
virtue
and
sanctity
to
the
educated
mind
it
seems
obvious
that
a
fire
which
a
man
kindles
with
the
sweat
of
his
brow
by
laboriously
rubbing
one
stick
against
each
other
can
possess
neither
more
nor
less
virtue
than
one
which
he
has
struck
in
a
moment
by
the
friction
of
a
lucifer
match
but
to
the
ignorant
and
superstitious
this
truth
is
far
from
apparent
and
accordingly
they
take
infinite
pains
to
do
in
a
roundabout
way
what
they
might
have
done
directly
with
the
greatest
ease
and
what
even
when
it
is
done
is
of
no
use
whatever
for
the
purpose
in
hand
a
vast
proportion
of
the
labour
which
mankind
has
expended
throughout
the
ages
has
been
no
better
spent
it
has
been
like
the
stone
of
sisyphus
eternally
rolled
up
hill
only
to
revolve
eternally
down
again
or
like
the
water
poured
for
ever
by
the
danaids
into
broken
pitchers
which
it
could
never
fill
the
curious
notion
that
the
can
not
kindle
if
any
other
fire
remains
alight
in
the
neighbourhood
seems
to
imply
that
fire
is
conceived
as
a
unity
which
is
broken
up
into
fractions
and
consequently
weakened
in
exact
proportion
to
the
number
of
places
where
it
burns
hence
in
order
to
obtain
it
at
full
strength
you
must
light
it
only
at
a
single
point
for
then
the
flame
will
burst
out
with
a
concentrated
energy
derived
from
the
tributary
fires
which
burned
on
all
the
extinguished
hearths
of
the
country
so
in
a
modern
city
if
all
the
gas
were
turned
off
simultaneously
at
all
the
burners
but
one
the
flame
would
no
doubt
blaze
at
that
one
burner
with
a
fierceness
such
as
no
single
burner
could
shew
when
all
are
burning
at
the
same
time
the
analogy
may
help
us
to
understand
the
process
of
reasoning
which
leads
the
peasantry
to
insist
on
the
extinction
of
all
common
fires
when
the
is
about
to
be
kindled
perhaps
too
it
may
partly
explain
that
ceremonial
extinction
of
all
old
fires
on
other
occasions
which
is
often
required
by
custom
as
a
preliminary
to
the
lighting
of
a
new
and
sacred
fire
we
have
seen
that
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
all
common
fires
were
extinguished
on
the
eve
of
as
a
preparation
for
kindling
the
beltane
bonfire
by
friction
next
morning
and
no
doubt
the
reason
for
the
extinction
was
the
same
as
in
the
case
of
the
indeed
we
may
assume
with
a
fair
degree
of
probability
that
the
was
the
parent
of
the
periodic
at
first
invoked
only
at
irregular
intervals
to
cure
certain
evils
as
they
occurred
the
powerful
virtue
of
fire
was
afterwards
employed
at
regular
intervals
to
prevent
the
occurrence
of
the
same
evils
as
well
as
to
remedy
such
as
had
actually
arisen
the
of
europe
has
its
parallel
in
a
ceremony
which
used
to
be
observed
by
the
iroquois
indians
of
north
america
formerly
when
an
epidemic
prevailed
among
the
iroquois
despite
the
efforts
to
stay
it
it
was
customary
for
the
principal
shaman
to
order
the
fires
in
every
cabin
to
be
extinguished
and
the
ashes
and
cinders
to
be
carefully
removed
for
it
was
believed
that
the
pestilence
was
sent
as
a
punishment
for
neglecting
to
rekindle
new
fire
or
because
of
the
manner
in
which
the
fire
then
in
use
had
been
kindled
so
after
all
the
fires
were
out
two
suitable
logs
of
slippery
elm
were
provided
for
the
new
fire
one
of
the
logs
was
from
six
to
eight
inches
in
diameter
and
from
eight
to
ten
feet
long
the
other
was
from
ten
to
twelve
inches
in
diameter
and
about
ten
feet
long
about
midway
across
the
larger
log
a
cuneiform
notch
or
cut
about
six
inches
deep
was
made
and
in
the
notch
punk
was
placed
the
other
log
was
drawn
rapidly
to
and
fro
in
the
cut
by
four
strong
men
chosen
for
the
purpose
until
the
punk
was
ignited
by
the
friction
thus
produced
before
and
during
the
progress
of
the
work
of
igniting
the
fire
the
shaman
votively
sprinkled
real
tobacco
three
several
times
into
the
cuneiform
notch
and
offered
earnest
prayers
to
the
beseeching
him
to
aid
to
bless
and
to
redeem
the
people
from
their
the
ignited
punk
was
used
to
light
a
large
bonfire
and
then
the
head
of
every
family
was
required
to
take
home
new
fire
to
rekindle
a
fire
in
his
or
her
the
sacrifice
of
an
animal
to
stay
a
sometimes
apparently
in
england
as
well
as
in
scotland
the
kindling
of
a
was
accompanied
by
the
sacrifice
of
a
calf
thus
in
northamptonshire
at
some
time
during
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
miss
and
her
cousin
walking
saw
a
fire
in
a
field
and
a
crowd
round
it
they
said
what
is
the
matter
killing
a
what
for
to
stop
the
they
went
away
as
quickly
as
possible
on
speaking
to
the
clergyman
he
made
enquiries
the
people
did
not
like
to
talk
of
the
affair
but
it
appeared
that
when
there
is
a
disease
among
the
cows
or
the
calves
are
born
sickly
they
sacrifice
kill
and
burn
one
for
good
it
is
not
here
said
that
the
fire
was
a
of
which
indeed
the
two
horrified
ladies
had
probably
never
heard
but
the
analogy
of
the
parallel
custom
in
mull
renders
it
probable
that
in
northamptonshire
also
the
fire
was
kindled
by
the
friction
of
wood
and
that
the
calf
or
some
part
of
it
was
burnt
in
the
fire
certainly
the
practice
of
burning
a
single
animal
alive
in
order
to
save
all
the
others
would
seem
to
have
been
not
uncommon
in
england
down
to
the
nineteenth
century
thus
a
farmer
in
cornwall
about
the
year
having
lost
many
cattle
by
disease
and
tried
many
remedies
in
vain
consulted
with
some
of
his
neighbours
and
laying
their
heads
together
they
recalled
to
their
recollections
a
tale
which
tradition
had
handed
down
from
remote
antiquity
that
the
calamity
would
not
cease
until
he
had
actually
burned
alive
the
finest
calf
which
he
had
upon
his
farm
but
that
when
this
sacrifice
was
made
the
murrain
would
afflict
his
cattle
no
accordingly
on
a
day
appointed
they
met
lighted
a
large
fire
placed
the
best
calf
in
it
and
standing
round
the
blazing
pile
drove
the
animal
with
pitchforks
back
into
the
flames
whenever
it
attempted
to
escape
thus
the
victim
was
burned
alive
to
save
the
rest
of
the
cattle
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
a
belief
prevailed
until
a
very
recent
period
amongst
the
small
farmers
in
the
districts
remote
from
towns
in
cornwall
that
a
living
sacrifice
appeased
the
wrath
of
god
this
sacrifice
must
be
by
fire
and
i
have
heard
it
argued
that
the
bible
gave
them
warranty
for
this
belief
while
correcting
these
sheets
i
am
informed
of
two
recent
instances
of
this
superstition
one
of
them
was
the
sacrifice
of
a
calf
by
a
farmer
near
portreath
for
the
purpose
of
removing
a
disease
which
had
long
followed
his
horses
and
his
cows
the
other
was
the
burning
of
a
living
lamb
to
save
as
the
farmer
said
his
flocks
from
spells
which
had
been
cast
on
in
a
recent
account
of
the
of
wales
we
read
that
i
have
also
heard
my
grandfather
and
father
say
that
in
times
gone
by
the
people
would
throw
a
calf
in
the
fire
when
there
was
any
disease
among
the
herds
the
same
would
be
done
with
a
sheep
if
there
was
anything
the
matter
with
a
flock
i
can
remember
myself
seeing
cattle
being
driven
between
two
fires
to
stop
the
disease
when
in
later
times
it
was
not
considered
humane
to
drive
the
cattle
between
the
fires
the
herdsmen
were
accustomed
to
force
the
animals
over
the
wood
ashes
to
protect
them
against
various
writing
about
the
antiquary
henderson
says
that
a
live
ox
was
burned
near
haltwhistle
in
northumberland
only
twenty
years
ago
to
stop
a
murrain
about
the
year
disease
broke
out
among
the
cattle
of
a
small
farm
in
the
parish
of
resoliss
black
isle
the
farmer
prevailed
on
his
wife
to
undertake
a
journey
to
a
wise
woman
of
renown
in
banffshire
to
ask
a
charm
against
the
effects
of
the
ill
the
long
journey
of
upwards
of
fifty
miles
was
performed
by
the
good
wife
and
the
charm
was
got
one
chief
thing
ordered
was
to
burn
to
death
a
pig
and
sprinkle
the
ashes
over
the
byre
and
other
farm
buildings
this
order
was
carried
out
except
that
the
pig
was
killed
before
it
was
burned
a
more
terrible
sacrifice
was
made
at
times
one
of
the
diseased
animals
was
rubbed
over
with
tar
driven
forth
set
on
fire
and
allowed
to
run
till
it
fell
down
and
living
animals
have
been
burnt
alive
in
sacrifice
within
memory
to
avert
the
loss
of
other
stock
the
burial
of
three
puppies
in
a
field
is
supposed
to
rid
it
of
weeds
throughout
the
rural
districts
of
devon
witchcraft
is
an
article
of
current
faith
and
the
toad
is
thrown
into
the
flames
as
an
emissary
of
the
evil
but
why
we
may
ask
should
the
burning
alive
of
a
calf
or
a
sheep
be
supposed
to
save
the
rest
of
the
herd
or
the
flock
from
the
murrain
according
to
one
writer
as
we
have
seen
the
burnt
sacrifice
was
thought
to
appease
the
wrath
of
god
the
idea
of
appeasing
the
wrath
of
a
ferocious
deity
by
burning
an
animal
alive
is
probably
no
more
than
a
theological
gloss
put
on
an
old
heathen
rite
it
would
hardly
occur
to
the
simple
mind
of
an
english
bumpkin
who
though
he
may
be
stupid
is
not
naturally
cruel
and
does
not
conceive
of
a
divinity
who
takes
delight
in
the
contemplation
of
suffering
to
his
thinking
god
has
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
the
murrain
but
witches
and
fairies
have
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it
the
english
farmer
who
burned
one
of
his
lambs
alive
said
that
he
did
it
to
save
his
flocks
from
spells
which
had
been
cast
on
them
and
the
scotch
farmer
who
was
bidden
to
burn
a
pig
alive
for
a
similar
purpose
but
who
had
the
humanity
to
kill
the
animal
first
believed
that
this
was
a
remedy
for
the
evil
eye
which
had
been
cast
upon
his
beasts
again
we
read
that
a
farmer
who
possessed
broad
acres
and
who
was
in
many
respects
a
sensible
man
was
greatly
annoyed
to
find
that
his
cattle
became
diseased
in
the
spring
nothing
could
satisfy
him
but
that
they
were
bewitched
and
he
was
resolved
to
find
out
the
person
who
had
cast
the
evil
eye
on
his
oxen
according
to
an
rule
the
farmer
took
one
of
his
bullocks
and
bled
it
to
death
catching
all
the
blood
on
bundles
of
straw
the
bloody
straw
was
then
piled
into
a
heap
and
set
on
fire
burning
with
a
vast
quantity
of
smoke
the
farmer
expected
to
see
the
witch
either
in
reality
or
in
shadow
amidst
the
such
reasons
express
the
real
beliefs
of
the
peasants
cattle
like
human
beings
were
exposed
to
the
influences
of
the
evil
eye
of
forespeaking
and
of
the
casting
of
evil
witches
and
warlocks
did
the
work
of
evil
among
their
neighbours
cattle
if
their
anger
had
been
aroused
in
any
way
the
fairies
often
wrought
injury
amongst
cattle
every
animal
that
died
suddenly
was
killed
by
the
dart
of
the
fairies
or
in
the
language
of
the
people
was
flint
arrows
and
went
by
the
name
of
faery
when
an
animal
died
suddenly
the
canny
woman
of
the
district
was
sent
for
to
search
for
the
faery
dairt
and
in
due
course
she
found
one
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
owner
of
the
dead
but
how
we
must
still
ask
can
burning
an
animal
alive
break
the
spell
that
has
been
cast
upon
its
fellows
by
a
witch
or
a
warlock
some
light
is
thrown
on
the
question
by
the
following
account
of
measures
which
rustic
wiseacres
in
suffolk
are
said
to
have
adopted
as
a
remedy
for
witchcraft
a
woman
i
knew
years
had
been
employed
by
my
predecessor
to
take
care
of
his
poultry
at
the
time
i
came
to
make
her
acquaintance
she
was
a
bedridden
toothless
crone
with
chin
and
nose
all
but
meeting
she
did
not
discourage
in
her
neighbours
the
idea
that
she
knew
more
than
people
ought
to
know
and
had
more
power
than
others
had
many
years
before
i
knew
her
it
happened
one
spring
that
the
ducks
which
were
a
part
of
her
charge
failed
to
lay
eggs
she
at
once
took
it
for
granted
that
the
ducks
had
been
bewitched
this
misbelief
involved
very
shocking
consequences
for
it
necessitated
the
idea
that
so
diabolical
an
act
could
only
be
combated
by
diabolical
cruelty
and
the
most
diabolical
act
of
cruelty
she
could
imagine
was
that
of
baking
alive
in
a
hot
oven
one
of
the
ducks
and
that
was
what
she
did
the
sequence
of
thought
in
her
mind
was
that
the
spell
that
had
been
laid
on
the
ducks
was
that
of
preternaturally
wicked
wilfulness
that
this
spell
could
only
be
broken
through
intensity
of
suffering
in
this
case
death
by
burning
that
the
intensity
of
suffering
would
break
the
spell
in
the
one
roasted
to
death
and
that
the
spell
broken
in
one
would
be
altogether
broken
that
is
in
all
the
ducks
shocking
however
as
was
this
method
of
exorcising
the
ducks
there
was
nothing
in
it
original
just
about
a
hundred
years
before
everyone
in
the
town
and
neighbourhood
of
ipswich
had
heard
and
many
had
believed
that
a
witch
had
been
burnt
to
death
in
her
own
house
at
ipswich
by
the
process
of
burning
alive
one
of
the
sheep
she
had
bewitched
it
was
curious
but
it
was
as
convincing
as
curious
that
the
hands
and
feet
of
this
witch
were
the
only
parts
of
her
that
had
not
been
incinerated
this
however
was
satisfactorily
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
four
feet
of
the
sheep
by
which
it
had
been
suspended
over
the
fire
had
not
been
destroyed
in
the
flames
that
had
consumed
its
according
to
a
slightly
different
account
of
the
same
tragic
incident
the
last
of
the
ipswitch
witches
one
grace
pett
laid
her
hand
heavily
on
a
farmer
s
sheep
who
in
order
to
punish
her
fastened
one
of
the
sheep
in
the
ground
and
burnt
it
except
the
feet
which
were
under
the
earth
the
next
morning
grace
pett
was
found
burnt
to
a
cinder
except
her
feet
her
fate
is
recorded
in
the
as
a
case
of
spontaneous
this
last
anecdote
is
instructive
if
perhaps
not
strictly
authentic
it
shews
that
in
burning
alive
one
of
a
bewitched
flock
or
herd
what
you
really
do
is
to
burn
the
witch
who
is
either
actually
incarnate
in
the
animal
or
perhaps
more
probably
stands
in
a
relation
of
sympathy
with
it
so
close
as
almost
to
amount
to
identity
hence
if
you
burn
the
creature
to
ashes
you
utterly
destroy
the
witch
and
thereby
save
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
the
flock
or
herd
from
her
abominable
machinations
whereas
if
you
only
partially
burn
the
animal
allowing
some
parts
of
it
to
escape
the
flames
the
witch
is
only
and
her
power
for
mischief
may
be
hardly
if
at
all
impaired
by
the
grilling
we
can
now
see
that
in
such
matters
are
useless
to
kill
the
animal
first
and
burn
it
afterwards
is
a
weak
compromise
dictated
no
doubt
by
a
but
utterly
mistaken
kindness
it
is
like
shutting
the
when
the
steed
is
stolen
for
obviously
by
leaving
the
animal
s
and
therefore
the
witch
s
body
nearly
intact
at
the
moment
of
death
it
allows
her
soul
to
escape
and
return
safe
and
sound
to
her
own
human
body
which
all
the
time
is
probably
lying
quietly
at
home
in
bed
and
the
same
train
of
reasoning
that
justifies
the
burning
alive
of
bewitched
animals
justifies
and
indeed
requires
the
burning
alive
of
the
witches
themselves
it
is
really
the
only
way
of
destroying
them
body
and
soul
and
therefore
of
thoroughly
extirpating
the
whole
infernal
crew
in
the
isle
of
man
the
practice
of
burning
cattle
alive
in
order
to
stop
a
murrain
seems
to
have
persisted
down
to
a
time
within
living
memory
on
this
subject
i
will
quote
the
evidence
collected
by
sir
john
rhys
a
respectable
farmer
from
andreas
told
me
that
he
was
driving
with
his
wife
to
the
neighbouring
parish
of
jurby
some
years
ago
and
that
on
the
way
they
beheld
the
carcase
of
a
cow
or
an
ox
burning
in
a
field
with
a
woman
engaged
in
stirring
the
fire
on
reaching
the
village
to
which
they
were
going
they
found
that
the
burning
beast
belonged
to
a
farmer
whom
they
knew
they
were
further
told
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
said
farmer
had
one
of
his
cattle
burnt
as
several
of
them
had
recently
died
whether
this
was
a
case
of
sacrifice
or
not
i
can
not
say
but
let
me
give
you
another
instance
a
man
whom
i
have
already
mentioned
saw
at
a
farm
nearer
the
centre
of
the
island
a
live
calf
being
burnt
the
owner
bears
an
english
name
but
his
family
has
long
been
settled
in
man
the
farmer
s
explanation
to
my
informant
was
that
the
calf
was
burnt
to
secure
luck
for
the
rest
of
the
herd
some
of
which
were
threatening
to
die
my
informant
thought
there
was
absolutely
nothing
the
matter
with
them
except
that
they
had
too
little
to
eat
be
that
as
it
may
the
one
calf
was
sacrificed
as
a
to
secure
luck
for
the
rest
of
the
cattle
let
me
here
also
quote
moore
s
note
in
his
on
the
place
name
yn
oural
or
the
chapel
of
the
burnt
sacrifice
this
name
he
says
records
a
circumstance
which
took
place
in
the
nineteenth
century
but
which
it
is
to
be
hoped
was
never
customary
in
the
isle
of
man
a
farmer
who
had
lost
a
number
of
his
sheep
and
cattle
by
murrain
burned
a
calf
as
a
propitiatory
offering
to
the
deity
on
this
spot
where
a
chapel
was
afterwards
built
hence
the
particulars
i
may
say
of
time
place
and
person
could
be
easily
added
to
moore
s
statement
excepting
perhaps
as
to
the
deity
in
question
on
that
point
i
have
never
been
informed
but
moore
is
probably
right
in
the
use
of
the
capital
as
the
sacrificer
is
according
to
all
accounts
a
highly
devout
christian
one
more
instance
an
octogenarian
woman
born
in
the
parish
of
bride
and
now
living
at
kirk
andreas
saw
when
she
was
a
lump
of
a
girl
of
ten
or
fifteen
years
of
age
a
live
sheep
being
burnt
in
a
field
in
the
parish
of
andreas
on
whereby
she
meant
the
first
of
may
reckoned
according
to
the
old
style
she
asserts
very
decidedly
that
it
was
as
a
sacrifice
as
she
put
it
and
for
an
object
to
the
public
those
were
her
words
when
she
expressed
herself
in
english
further
she
made
the
statement
that
it
was
a
custom
to
burn
a
sheep
on
old
for
a
sacrifice
i
was
fully
alive
to
the
interest
of
this
evidence
and
her
so
far
as
her
age
allows
of
it
and
i
find
that
she
adheres
to
her
statement
with
all
but
manxmen
burn
beasts
when
they
are
dead
as
well
as
when
they
are
alive
and
their
reasons
for
burning
the
dead
animals
may
help
us
to
understand
their
reasons
for
burning
the
living
animals
on
this
subject
i
will
again
quote
sir
john
rhys
when
a
beast
dies
on
a
farm
of
course
it
dies
according
to
the
view
of
things
as
i
understand
it
from
the
influence
of
the
evil
eye
or
the
interposition
of
a
witch
so
if
you
want
to
know
to
whom
you
are
indebted
for
the
loss
of
the
beast
you
have
simply
to
burn
its
carcase
in
the
open
air
and
watch
who
comes
first
to
the
spot
or
who
first
passes
by
that
is
the
criminal
to
be
charged
with
the
death
of
the
animal
and
he
can
not
help
coming
is
the
effect
of
the
fire
a
michael
woman
who
is
now
about
thirty
related
to
me
how
she
watched
while
the
carcase
of
a
bewitched
colt
was
burning
how
she
saw
the
witch
coming
and
how
she
remembers
her
shrivelled
face
with
nose
and
chin
in
close
proximity
according
to
another
native
of
michael
a
man
the
animal
in
question
was
oftenest
a
calf
and
it
was
wont
to
be
burnt
whole
skin
and
all
the
object
according
to
him
is
invariably
to
bring
the
bewitcher
on
the
spot
and
he
always
comes
but
i
am
not
clear
what
happens
to
him
when
he
appears
my
informant
added
however
that
it
was
believed
that
unless
the
bewitcher
got
possession
of
the
heart
of
the
burning
beast
he
lost
all
his
power
of
these
statements
shew
that
in
the
isle
of
man
the
sympathetic
relation
between
the
witch
and
his
or
her
animal
victim
is
believed
to
be
so
close
that
by
burning
the
animal
you
compel
the
witch
to
appear
the
original
idea
may
have
been
that
by
virtue
of
a
magic
sympathy
which
binds
the
two
together
whatever
harm
you
do
to
the
animal
is
felt
by
the
witch
as
if
it
were
done
to
herself
that
notion
would
fully
explain
why
manx
people
used
also
to
burn
bewitched
animals
alive
in
doing
so
they
probably
imagined
that
they
were
simultaneously
burning
the
witch
who
had
cast
the
spell
on
their
cattle
this
explanation
of
the
reason
for
burning
a
bewitched
animal
dead
or
alive
is
confirmed
by
the
parallel
belief
concerning
it
is
commonly
supposed
that
certain
men
and
women
can
transform
themselves
by
magic
art
into
wolves
or
other
animals
but
that
any
wound
inflicted
on
such
a
transformed
beast
a
or
other
is
simultaneously
inflicted
on
the
human
body
of
the
witch
or
warlock
who
had
transformed
herself
or
himself
into
the
creature
this
belief
is
widely
diffused
it
meets
us
in
europe
asia
and
africa
for
example
olaus
magnus
tells
us
that
in
livonia
not
many
years
before
he
wrote
a
noble
lady
had
a
dispute
with
her
slave
on
the
subject
of
she
doubting
whether
there
were
any
such
things
and
he
maintaining
that
there
were
to
convince
her
he
retired
to
a
room
from
which
he
soon
appeared
in
the
form
of
a
wolf
being
chased
by
the
dogs
into
the
forest
and
brought
to
bay
the
wolf
defended
himself
fiercely
but
lost
an
eye
in
the
struggle
next
day
the
slave
returned
to
his
mistress
in
human
form
but
with
only
one
eye
again
it
happened
in
the
year
that
a
gentleman
in
a
village
among
the
mountains
of
auvergne
looking
out
of
the
window
one
evening
saw
a
friend
of
his
going
out
to
hunt
he
begged
him
to
bring
him
back
some
of
his
bag
and
his
friend
said
that
he
would
well
he
had
not
gone
very
far
before
he
met
a
huge
wolf
he
fired
and
missed
it
and
the
animal
attacked
him
furiously
but
he
stood
on
his
guard
and
with
an
adroit
stroke
of
his
hunting
knife
he
cut
off
the
right
of
the
brute
which
thereupon
fled
away
and
he
saw
it
no
more
he
returned
to
his
friend
and
drawing
from
his
pouch
the
severed
paw
of
the
wolf
he
found
to
his
horror
that
it
was
turned
into
a
woman
s
hand
with
a
golden
ring
on
one
of
the
fingers
his
friend
recognized
the
ring
as
that
of
his
own
wife
and
went
to
find
her
she
was
sitting
by
the
fire
with
her
right
arm
under
her
apron
as
she
refused
to
draw
it
out
her
husband
confronted
her
with
the
hand
and
the
ring
on
it
she
at
once
confessed
the
truth
that
it
was
she
in
the
form
of
a
whom
the
hunter
had
wounded
her
confession
was
confirmed
by
applying
the
severed
hand
to
the
stump
of
her
arm
for
the
two
fitted
exactly
the
angry
husband
delivered
up
his
wicked
wife
to
justice
she
was
tried
and
burnt
as
a
witch
it
is
said
that
a
scouring
the
streets
of
padua
was
caught
and
when
they
cut
off
his
four
paws
he
at
once
turned
into
a
man
but
with
both
his
hands
and
feet
amputated
again
in
a
farm
of
the
french
district
of
beauce
there
was
once
a
herdsman
who
never
slept
at
home
these
nocturnal
absences
naturally
attracted
attention
and
set
people
talking
at
the
same
time
by
a
curious
coincidence
a
wolf
used
to
prowl
round
the
farm
every
night
and
to
excite
the
dogs
in
the
farmyard
to
fury
by
thrusting
his
snout
derisively
through
the
cat
s
hole
in
the
great
gate
the
farmer
had
his
suspicions
and
he
determined
to
watch
one
night
when
the
herdsman
went
out
as
usual
his
master
followed
him
quietly
till
he
came
to
a
hut
where
with
his
own
eyes
he
saw
the
man
put
on
a
broad
belt
and
at
once
turn
into
a
wolf
which
scoured
away
over
the
fields
the
farmer
smiled
a
sickly
sort
of
smile
and
went
back
to
the
farm
there
he
took
a
stout
stick
and
sat
down
at
the
cat
s
hole
to
wait
he
had
not
long
to
wait
the
dogs
barked
like
mad
a
wolf
s
snout
shewed
through
the
hole
down
came
the
stick
out
gushed
the
blood
and
a
voice
was
heard
to
say
without
the
gate
a
good
job
too
i
had
still
three
years
to
next
day
the
herdsman
appeared
as
usual
but
he
had
a
scar
on
his
brow
and
he
never
went
out
again
at
night
in
china
also
the
faith
in
similar
transformations
is
reflected
in
the
following
tale
a
certain
man
in
sungyang
went
into
the
mountains
to
gather
fuel
night
fell
and
he
was
pursued
by
two
tigers
but
scrambled
up
a
tree
out
of
their
reach
then
said
the
one
tiger
to
the
other
tiger
if
we
can
find
we
are
sure
to
catch
this
man
up
the
so
off
went
one
of
them
to
find
while
the
other
kept
watch
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
soon
after
that
another
tiger
leaner
and
longer
than
the
other
two
appeared
on
the
scene
and
made
a
grab
at
the
man
s
coat
but
fortunately
the
moon
was
shining
the
man
saw
the
paw
and
with
a
stroke
of
his
axe
cut
off
one
of
its
claws
the
tigers
roared
and
fled
one
after
the
other
so
the
man
climbed
down
the
tree
and
went
home
when
he
told
his
tale
in
the
village
suspicion
naturally
fell
on
the
said
and
next
day
some
men
went
to
see
him
in
his
house
they
were
told
that
they
could
not
see
him
for
he
had
been
out
the
night
before
and
had
hurt
his
hand
and
he
was
now
ill
in
bed
so
they
put
two
and
two
together
and
reported
him
to
the
police
the
police
arrived
surrounded
the
house
and
set
fire
to
it
but
rose
from
his
bed
turned
into
a
tiger
charged
right
through
the
police
and
escaped
and
to
this
day
nobody
ever
knew
where
he
went
to
the
toradjas
of
central
celebes
stand
in
very
great
fear
of
that
is
of
men
and
women
who
have
the
power
of
transforming
their
spirits
into
animals
such
as
cats
crocodiles
wild
pigs
apes
deer
and
buffaloes
which
roam
about
battening
on
human
flesh
and
especially
on
human
livers
while
the
men
and
women
in
their
own
proper
human
form
are
sleeping
quietly
in
their
beds
at
home
among
them
a
man
is
either
born
a
or
becomes
one
by
infection
for
mere
contact
with
a
or
even
with
anything
that
has
been
touched
by
his
spittle
is
quite
enough
to
turn
the
most
innocent
person
into
a
nay
even
to
lean
your
head
against
anything
against
which
a
has
leaned
his
head
suffices
to
do
it
the
penalty
for
being
a
is
death
but
the
sentence
is
never
passed
until
the
accused
has
had
a
fair
trial
and
his
guilt
has
been
clearly
demonstrated
by
an
ordeal
which
consists
in
dipping
the
middle
finger
into
boiling
resin
if
the
finger
is
not
burnt
the
man
is
no
but
if
it
is
burnt
a
he
most
assuredly
is
so
they
take
him
away
to
a
quiet
spot
and
hack
him
to
bits
in
cutting
him
up
the
executioners
are
naturally
very
careful
not
to
be
bespattered
with
his
blood
for
if
that
were
to
happen
they
would
of
course
be
turned
into
themselves
further
they
place
his
severed
head
beside
his
to
prevent
his
soul
from
coming
to
life
again
and
pursuing
his
depredations
so
great
is
the
horror
of
among
the
toradjas
and
so
great
is
their
fear
of
contracting
the
deadly
taint
by
infection
that
many
persons
have
assured
a
missionary
that
they
would
not
spare
their
own
child
if
they
knew
him
to
be
a
now
these
people
whose
faith
in
is
not
a
mere
dying
or
dead
superstition
but
a
living
dreadful
conviction
tell
stories
of
which
conform
to
the
type
which
we
are
examining
they
say
that
once
upon
a
time
a
came
in
human
shape
under
the
house
of
a
neighbour
while
his
real
body
lay
asleep
as
usual
at
home
and
calling
out
softly
to
the
man
s
wife
made
an
assignation
with
her
to
meet
him
in
the
next
day
but
the
husband
was
lying
awake
and
he
heard
it
all
but
he
said
nothing
to
anybody
next
day
chanced
to
be
a
busy
one
in
the
village
for
a
roof
had
to
be
put
on
a
new
house
and
all
the
men
were
lending
a
hand
with
the
work
and
among
them
to
be
sure
was
the
himself
i
mean
to
say
his
own
human
self
there
he
was
up
on
the
roof
working
away
as
hard
as
anybody
but
the
woman
went
out
to
the
and
behind
went
unseen
her
husband
slinking
through
the
underwood
when
they
were
come
to
the
field
he
saw
the
make
up
to
his
wife
so
out
he
rushed
and
struck
at
him
with
a
stick
quick
as
thought
the
turned
himself
into
a
leaf
but
the
man
was
as
nimble
for
he
caught
up
the
leaf
thrust
it
into
the
joint
of
bamboo
in
which
he
kept
his
tobacco
and
bunged
it
up
tight
then
he
walked
back
with
his
wife
to
the
village
carrying
the
bamboo
with
the
in
it
when
they
came
to
the
village
the
human
body
of
the
was
still
on
the
roof
working
away
with
the
rest
the
man
put
the
bamboo
in
a
fire
at
that
the
human
looked
down
from
the
roof
and
said
don
t
do
the
man
drew
the
bamboo
from
the
fire
but
a
moment
afterwards
he
put
it
in
the
fire
again
and
again
the
human
on
the
roof
looked
down
and
cried
don
t
do
but
this
time
the
man
kept
the
bamboo
in
the
fire
and
when
it
blazed
up
down
fell
the
human
from
the
roof
as
dead
as
a
stone
again
the
following
story
went
round
among
the
toradjas
not
so
very
many
years
ago
the
thing
happened
at
soemara
on
the
gulf
of
tomori
it
was
evening
and
some
men
sat
chatting
with
a
certain
hadji
mohammad
when
it
had
grown
dark
one
of
the
men
went
out
of
the
house
for
something
or
other
a
little
while
afterwards
one
of
the
company
thought
he
saw
a
stag
s
antlers
standing
out
sharp
and
clear
against
the
bright
evening
sky
so
hadji
mohammad
raised
his
gun
and
fired
a
minute
or
two
afterwards
back
comes
the
man
who
had
gone
out
and
says
he
to
hadji
mohammad
you
shot
at
me
and
hit
me
you
must
pay
me
a
they
searched
him
but
found
no
wound
on
him
anywhere
then
they
knew
that
he
was
a
who
had
turned
himself
into
a
stag
and
had
healed
the
by
licking
it
however
the
bullet
had
found
its
billet
for
two
days
afterwards
he
was
a
dead
man
in
sennar
a
province
of
the
egyptian
sudan
the
hammeg
and
fungi
enjoy
the
reputation
of
being
powerful
magicians
who
can
turn
themselves
into
hyaenas
and
in
that
guise
scour
the
country
at
night
howling
and
gorging
themselves
but
by
day
they
are
men
again
it
is
very
dangerous
to
shoot
at
such
human
hyaenas
by
night
on
the
jebel
bela
mountain
a
soldier
once
shot
at
a
hyaena
and
hit
it
but
it
dragged
itself
off
bleeding
in
the
darkness
and
escaped
next
morning
he
followed
up
the
trail
of
blood
and
it
led
him
straight
to
the
hut
of
a
man
who
was
everywhere
known
for
a
wizard
nothing
of
the
hyaena
was
to
be
seen
but
the
man
himself
was
laid
up
in
the
house
with
a
fresh
wound
and
died
soon
afterwards
and
the
soldier
did
not
long
survive
him
but
the
classical
example
of
these
stories
is
an
old
roman
tale
told
by
petronius
it
is
put
in
the
mouth
of
one
niceros
late
at
night
he
left
the
town
to
visit
a
friend
of
his
a
widow
who
lived
at
a
farm
five
miles
down
the
road
he
was
accompanied
by
a
soldier
who
lodged
in
the
same
house
a
man
of
herculean
build
when
they
set
out
it
was
near
dawn
but
the
moon
shone
as
bright
as
day
passing
through
the
outskirts
of
the
town
they
came
amongst
the
tombs
which
lined
the
highroad
for
some
distance
there
the
soldier
made
an
excuse
for
retiring
behind
a
monument
and
niceros
sat
down
to
wait
for
him
humming
a
tune
and
counting
the
tombstones
to
pass
the
time
in
a
little
he
looked
round
for
his
companion
and
saw
a
sight
which
froze
him
with
horror
the
soldier
had
stripped
off
his
clothes
to
the
last
rag
and
laid
them
at
the
side
of
the
highway
then
he
performed
a
certain
ceremony
over
them
and
immediately
was
changed
into
a
wolf
and
ran
howling
into
the
forest
when
niceros
had
recovered
himself
a
little
he
went
to
pick
up
the
clothes
but
found
that
they
were
turned
to
stone
more
dead
than
alive
he
drew
his
sword
and
striking
at
every
shadow
cast
by
the
tombstones
on
the
moonlit
road
he
tottered
to
his
friend
s
house
he
entered
it
like
a
ghost
to
the
surprise
of
the
widow
who
wondered
to
see
him
abroad
so
late
if
you
had
only
been
here
a
little
ago
said
she
you
might
have
been
of
some
use
for
a
wolf
came
tearing
into
the
yard
scaring
the
cattle
and
bleeding
them
like
a
butcher
but
he
did
not
get
off
so
easily
for
the
servant
speared
him
in
the
after
hearing
these
words
niceros
felt
that
he
could
not
close
an
eye
so
he
hurried
away
home
again
it
was
now
broad
daylight
but
when
he
came
to
the
place
where
the
clothes
had
been
turned
to
stone
he
found
only
a
pool
of
blood
he
reached
home
and
there
lay
the
soldier
in
bed
like
an
ox
in
the
shambles
and
the
doctor
was
bandaging
his
neck
then
i
knew
said
niceros
that
the
man
was
a
and
never
again
could
i
break
bread
with
him
no
not
if
you
had
killed
me
for
these
stories
may
help
us
to
understand
the
custom
of
burning
a
bewitched
animal
which
has
been
observed
in
our
own
country
down
to
recent
times
if
indeed
it
is
even
now
extinct
for
a
close
parallel
may
be
traced
in
some
respects
between
witches
and
like
witches
are
commonly
supposed
to
be
able
to
transform
themselves
temporarily
into
animals
for
the
purpose
of
playing
their
mischievous
pranks
and
like
they
can
in
their
animal
disguise
be
compelled
to
unmask
themselves
to
any
one
who
succeeds
in
drawing
their
blood
in
either
case
the
is
conceived
as
a
cloak
thrown
round
the
wicked
enchanter
and
if
you
can
only
pierce
the
skin
whether
by
the
stab
of
a
knife
or
the
shot
of
a
gun
you
so
rend
the
disguise
that
the
man
or
woman
inside
of
it
stands
revealed
in
his
or
her
true
colours
strictly
speaking
the
stab
should
be
given
on
the
brow
or
between
the
eyes
in
the
case
both
of
a
witch
and
of
a
and
it
is
vain
to
shoot
at
a
unless
you
have
had
the
bullet
blessed
in
a
chapel
of
hubert
or
happen
to
be
carrying
about
you
without
knowing
it
a
clover
otherwise
the
bullet
will
merely
rebound
from
the
like
water
from
a
duck
s
back
however
in
armenia
they
say
that
the
who
in
that
country
is
usually
a
woman
can
be
killed
neither
by
shot
nor
by
steel
the
only
way
of
delivering
the
unhappy
woman
from
her
bondage
is
to
get
hold
of
her
wolf
s
skin
and
burn
it
for
that
naturally
prevents
her
from
turning
into
a
wolf
again
but
it
is
not
easy
to
find
the
skin
for
she
is
cunning
enough
to
hide
it
by
day
so
with
witches
it
is
not
only
useless
but
even
dangerous
to
shoot
at
one
of
them
when
she
has
turned
herself
into
a
hare
if
you
do
the
gun
may
burst
in
your
hand
or
the
shot
come
back
and
kill
you
the
only
way
to
make
quite
sure
of
hitting
a
is
to
put
a
silver
sixpence
or
a
silver
button
in
your
gun
for
example
it
happened
one
evening
that
a
native
of
the
island
of
tiree
was
going
home
with
a
new
gun
when
he
saw
a
black
sheep
running
towards
him
across
the
plain
of
reef
something
about
the
creature
excited
his
suspicion
so
he
put
a
silver
sixpence
in
his
gun
and
fired
at
it
instantly
the
black
sheep
became
a
woman
with
a
drugget
coat
wrapt
round
her
head
the
man
knew
her
quite
well
for
she
was
a
witch
who
had
often
persecuted
him
before
in
the
shape
of
a
cat
again
the
wounds
inflicted
on
a
or
a
are
to
be
seen
on
the
witch
herself
just
as
the
wounds
inflicted
on
a
are
to
be
seen
on
the
man
himself
when
he
has
doffed
the
wolf
s
skin
to
take
a
few
instances
out
of
a
multitude
a
young
man
in
the
island
of
lismore
was
out
shooting
when
he
was
near
balnagown
loch
he
started
a
hare
and
fired
at
it
the
animal
gave
an
unearthly
scream
and
then
for
the
first
time
it
occurred
to
him
that
there
were
no
real
hares
in
lismore
he
threw
away
his
gun
in
terror
and
fled
home
and
next
day
he
heard
that
a
notorious
witch
was
laid
up
with
a
broken
leg
a
man
need
be
no
conjuror
to
guess
how
she
came
by
that
broken
leg
again
at
thurso
certain
witches
used
to
turn
themselves
into
cats
and
in
that
shape
to
torment
an
honest
man
one
night
he
lost
patience
whipped
out
his
broadsword
and
put
them
to
flight
as
they
were
scurrying
away
he
struck
at
them
and
cut
off
a
leg
of
one
of
the
cats
to
his
astonishment
it
was
a
woman
s
leg
and
next
morning
he
found
one
of
the
witches
short
of
the
corresponding
limb
glanvil
tells
a
story
of
an
old
woman
in
whose
astral
spirit
coming
into
a
man
s
house
as
he
was
sitting
alone
at
the
fire
in
the
shape
of
an
huge
cat
and
setting
her
self
before
the
fire
not
far
from
him
he
stole
a
stroke
at
the
back
of
it
with
a
and
seemed
to
break
the
back
of
it
but
it
scambled
from
him
and
vanisht
he
knew
not
how
but
such
an
old
woman
a
reputed
witch
was
found
dead
in
her
bed
that
very
night
with
her
back
broken
as
i
have
heard
some
years
ago
credibly
in
yorkshire
during
the
latter
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
parish
clergyman
was
told
a
circumstantial
story
of
an
old
witch
named
nanny
who
was
hunted
in
the
form
of
a
hare
for
several
miles
over
the
westerdale
moors
and
kept
well
away
from
the
dogs
till
a
black
one
joined
the
pack
and
succeeded
in
taking
a
bit
out
of
one
of
the
hare
s
legs
that
was
the
end
of
the
chase
and
immediately
afterwards
the
sportsmen
found
old
nanny
laid
up
in
bed
with
a
sore
leg
on
examining
the
wounded
limb
they
discovered
that
the
hurt
was
precisely
in
that
part
of
it
which
in
the
hare
had
been
bitten
by
the
black
dog
and
what
was
still
more
significant
the
wound
had
all
the
appearance
of
having
been
inflicted
by
a
dog
s
teeth
so
they
put
two
and
two
together
the
same
sort
of
thing
is
often
reported
in
lincolnshire
one
night
said
a
servant
from
kirton
lindsey
my
father
and
brother
saw
a
cat
in
front
of
them
father
knew
it
was
a
witch
and
took
a
stone
and
hammered
it
next
day
the
witch
had
her
face
all
tied
up
and
shortly
afterwards
again
a
bardney
bumpkin
told
how
a
witch
in
his
neighbourhood
could
take
all
sorts
of
shapes
one
night
a
man
shot
a
hare
and
when
he
went
to
the
witch
s
house
he
found
her
plastering
a
wound
just
where
he
had
shot
the
hare
so
in
county
leitrim
in
ireland
they
say
that
a
hare
pursued
by
dogs
fled
to
a
house
near
at
hand
but
just
as
it
was
bolting
in
at
the
door
one
of
the
dogs
came
up
with
it
and
nipped
a
piece
out
of
its
leg
the
hunters
entered
the
house
and
found
no
hare
there
but
only
an
old
woman
and
her
side
was
bleeding
so
they
knew
what
to
think
of
her
again
in
the
vosges
mountains
a
great
big
hare
used
to
come
out
every
evening
to
take
the
air
at
the
foot
of
the
mont
des
fourches
all
the
sportsmen
of
the
neighbourhood
tried
their
hands
on
that
hare
for
a
month
but
not
one
of
them
could
hit
it
at
last
one
marksman
more
knowing
than
the
rest
loaded
his
gun
with
some
pellets
of
a
consecrated
wafer
in
addition
to
the
usual
pellets
of
lead
that
did
the
trick
if
puss
was
not
killed
outright
she
was
badly
hurt
and
limped
away
uttering
shrieks
and
curses
in
a
human
voice
later
it
transpired
that
she
was
no
other
than
the
witch
of
a
neighbouring
village
who
had
the
power
of
putting
on
the
shape
of
any
animal
she
pleased
again
a
hunter
of
travexin
in
the
vosges
fired
at
a
hare
and
almost
shot
away
one
of
its
hind
legs
nevertheless
the
creature
contrived
to
escape
into
a
cottage
through
the
open
door
immediately
a
child
s
cries
were
heard
to
proceed
from
the
cottage
and
the
hunter
could
distinguish
these
words
daddy
daddy
come
quick
poor
mammy
has
her
leg
in
swabia
the
witches
are
liable
to
accidents
of
the
same
sort
when
they
go
about
their
business
in
the
form
of
animals
for
example
there
was
a
soldier
who
was
betrothed
to
a
young
woman
and
used
to
visit
her
every
evening
when
he
was
off
duty
but
one
evening
the
girl
told
him
that
he
must
not
come
to
the
house
on
friday
nights
because
it
was
never
convenient
to
her
to
see
him
then
this
roused
his
suspicion
and
the
very
next
friday
night
he
set
out
to
go
to
his
sweetheart
s
house
on
the
way
a
white
cat
ran
up
to
him
in
the
street
and
dogged
his
steps
and
when
the
animal
would
not
make
off
he
drew
his
sword
and
slashed
off
one
of
its
paws
on
that
the
cat
bolted
the
soldier
walked
on
but
when
he
came
to
his
sweetheart
s
house
he
found
her
in
bed
and
when
he
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
she
gave
a
very
confused
reply
noticing
stains
of
blood
on
the
bed
he
drew
down
the
coverlet
and
saw
that
the
girl
was
weltering
in
her
gore
for
one
of
her
feet
was
lopped
off
so
that
s
what
s
the
matter
with
you
you
witch
said
he
and
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
her
and
within
three
days
she
was
dead
again
a
farmer
in
the
neighbourhood
of
wiesensteig
frequently
found
in
his
stable
a
horse
over
and
above
the
four
horses
he
actually
owned
he
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
and
mentioned
the
matter
to
the
smith
the
smith
said
quietly
the
next
time
you
see
a
fifth
horse
in
the
stable
just
you
send
for
well
it
was
not
long
before
the
strange
horse
was
there
again
and
the
farmer
at
once
sent
for
the
smith
he
came
bringing
four
with
him
and
said
i
m
sure
the
nag
has
no
shoes
i
ll
shoe
her
for
no
sooner
said
than
done
however
the
smith
overreached
himself
for
next
day
when
his
friend
the
farmer
paid
him
a
visit
he
found
the
smith
s
own
wife
prancing
about
with
nailed
on
her
hands
and
feet
but
it
was
the
last
time
she
ever
appeared
in
the
shape
of
a
horse
once
more
in
silesia
they
tell
of
a
miller
s
apprentice
a
sturdy
and
industrious
young
fellow
who
set
out
on
his
travels
one
day
he
came
to
a
mill
and
the
miller
told
him
that
he
wanted
an
apprentice
but
did
not
care
to
engage
one
because
hitherto
all
his
apprentices
had
run
away
in
the
night
and
when
he
came
down
in
the
morning
the
mill
was
at
a
stand
however
he
liked
the
looks
of
the
young
chap
and
took
him
into
his
pay
but
what
the
new
apprentice
heard
about
the
mill
and
his
predecessors
was
not
encouraging
so
the
first
night
when
it
was
his
duty
to
watch
in
the
mill
he
took
care
to
provide
himself
with
an
axe
and
a
and
while
he
kept
one
eye
on
the
whirring
humming
wheels
he
kept
the
other
on
the
good
book
which
he
read
by
the
flickering
light
of
a
candle
set
on
a
table
so
the
hours
at
first
passed
quietly
with
nothing
to
disturb
him
but
the
monotonous
drone
and
click
of
the
machinery
but
on
the
stroke
of
twelve
as
he
was
still
reading
with
the
axe
lying
on
the
table
within
reach
the
door
opened
and
in
came
two
grey
cats
mewing
an
old
one
and
a
young
one
they
sat
down
opposite
him
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
they
did
not
like
his
wakefulness
and
the
and
the
axe
suddenly
the
old
cat
reached
out
a
paw
and
made
a
grab
at
the
axe
but
the
young
chap
was
too
quick
for
her
and
held
it
fast
then
the
young
cat
tried
to
do
the
same
for
the
but
the
apprentice
gripped
it
tight
thus
balked
the
two
cats
set
up
such
a
squalling
that
the
young
fellow
could
hardly
say
his
prayers
just
before
one
o
clock
the
younger
cat
sprang
on
the
table
and
fetched
a
blow
with
her
right
paw
at
the
candle
to
put
it
out
but
the
apprentice
struck
at
her
with
his
axe
and
sliced
the
paw
off
whereupon
the
two
cats
vanished
with
a
frightful
screech
the
apprentice
wrapped
the
paw
up
in
paper
to
shew
it
to
his
master
very
glad
the
miller
was
next
morning
when
he
came
down
and
found
the
mill
going
and
the
young
chap
at
his
post
the
apprentice
told
him
what
had
happened
in
the
night
and
gave
him
the
parcel
containing
the
cat
s
paw
but
when
the
miller
opened
it
what
was
the
astonishment
of
the
two
to
find
in
it
no
cat
s
paw
but
a
woman
s
hand
at
breakfast
the
miller
s
young
wife
did
not
as
usual
take
her
place
at
the
table
she
was
ill
in
bed
and
the
doctor
had
to
be
called
in
to
bind
up
her
right
arm
because
in
hewing
wood
so
they
said
she
had
made
a
slip
and
cut
off
her
own
right
hand
but
the
apprentice
packed
up
his
traps
and
turned
his
back
on
that
mill
before
the
sun
had
set
it
would
no
doubt
be
easy
to
multiply
instances
all
equally
well
attested
and
authentic
of
the
transformation
of
witches
into
animals
and
of
the
damage
which
the
women
themselves
have
sustained
through
injuries
inflicted
on
the
animals
but
the
foregoing
evidence
may
suffice
to
establish
the
complete
parallelism
between
witches
and
in
these
respects
the
analogy
appears
to
confirm
the
view
that
the
reason
for
burning
a
bewitched
animal
alive
is
a
belief
that
the
witch
herself
is
in
the
animal
and
that
by
burning
it
you
either
destroy
the
witch
completely
or
at
least
unmask
her
and
compel
her
to
reassume
her
proper
human
shape
in
which
she
is
naturally
far
less
potent
for
mischief
than
when
she
is
careering
about
the
country
in
the
likeness
of
a
cat
a
hare
a
horse
or
what
not
this
principle
is
still
indeed
clearly
recognized
by
people
in
oldenburg
though
as
might
be
expected
they
do
not
now
carry
out
the
principle
to
its
logical
conclusion
by
burning
the
bewitched
animal
or
person
alive
instead
they
resort
to
a
feeble
and
it
must
be
added
perfectly
futile
subterfuge
dictated
by
a
mistaken
humanity
or
a
fear
of
the
police
when
anything
living
is
bewitched
in
a
house
for
example
children
or
animals
they
burn
or
boil
the
nobler
inwards
of
animals
especially
the
hearts
but
also
the
lungs
or
the
liver
if
animals
have
died
they
take
the
inwards
of
one
of
them
or
of
an
animal
of
the
same
kind
slaughtered
for
the
purpose
but
if
that
is
not
possible
they
take
the
inwards
of
a
cock
by
preference
a
black
one
the
heart
lung
or
liver
is
stuck
all
over
with
needles
or
marked
with
a
cross
cut
or
placed
on
the
fire
in
a
tightly
closed
vessel
strict
silence
being
observed
and
doors
and
windows
well
shut
when
the
heart
boils
or
is
reduced
to
ashes
the
witch
must
appear
for
during
the
boiling
she
feels
the
burning
pain
she
either
begs
to
be
released
or
seeks
to
borrow
something
for
example
salt
or
a
coal
of
fire
or
she
takes
the
lid
off
the
pot
or
tries
to
induce
the
person
whose
spell
is
on
her
to
speak
they
say
too
that
a
woman
comes
with
a
if
it
is
a
sheep
that
has
died
you
proceed
in
the
same
way
with
a
tripe
from
its
stomach
and
prick
it
with
needles
while
it
is
on
the
boil
instead
of
boiling
it
some
people
nail
the
heart
to
the
highest
rafter
of
the
house
or
lay
it
on
the
edge
of
the
hearth
in
order
that
it
may
dry
up
no
doubt
because
the
same
thing
happens
to
the
witch
we
may
conjecture
that
other
sympathetic
means
of
destruction
are
employed
against
witchcraft
the
following
is
expressly
reported
the
heart
of
a
calf
that
has
died
is
stuck
all
over
with
needles
enclosed
in
a
bag
and
thrown
into
flowing
water
before
and
the
same
thing
holds
good
also
of
inanimate
objects
on
which
a
witch
has
cast
her
spell
in
wales
they
say
that
if
a
thing
is
bewitched
burn
it
and
immediately
afterwards
the
witch
will
come
to
borrow
something
of
you
if
you
give
what
she
asks
she
will
go
free
if
you
refuse
it
she
will
burn
and
a
mark
will
be
on
her
body
the
next
so
too
in
oldenburg
the
burning
of
things
that
are
bewitched
or
that
have
been
received
from
witches
is
another
way
of
breaking
the
spell
it
is
often
said
that
the
burning
should
take
place
at
a
and
in
several
places
are
shewn
where
the
burning
used
to
be
performed
as
a
rule
while
the
things
are
burning
the
guilty
witches
appear
though
not
always
in
their
own
shape
at
the
burning
of
bewitched
butter
they
often
appear
as
cockchafers
and
can
be
killed
with
impunity
victuals
received
from
witches
may
be
safely
consumed
if
only
you
first
burn
a
portion
of
for
example
a
young
man
in
oldenburg
was
wooing
a
girl
and
she
gave
him
two
fine
apples
as
a
gift
not
feeling
any
appetite
at
the
time
he
put
the
apples
in
his
pocket
and
when
he
came
home
he
laid
them
by
in
a
chest
two
or
three
days
afterwards
he
remembered
the
apples
and
went
to
the
chest
to
fetch
them
but
when
he
would
have
put
his
hand
on
them
what
was
his
horror
to
find
in
their
stead
two
fat
ugly
toads
in
the
chest
he
hastened
to
a
wise
man
and
asked
him
what
he
should
do
with
the
toads
the
man
told
him
to
boil
the
toads
alive
but
while
he
was
doing
so
he
must
be
sure
on
no
account
to
lend
anything
out
of
the
house
well
just
as
he
had
the
toads
in
a
pot
on
the
fire
and
the
water
began
to
grow
nicely
warm
who
should
come
to
the
door
but
the
girl
who
had
given
him
the
apples
and
she
wished
to
borrow
something
but
he
refused
to
give
her
anything
rated
her
as
a
witch
and
drove
her
out
of
the
house
a
little
afterwards
in
came
the
girl
s
mother
and
begged
with
tears
in
her
eyes
for
something
or
other
but
he
turned
her
out
also
the
last
word
she
said
to
him
was
that
he
should
at
least
spare
her
daughter
s
life
but
he
paid
no
heed
to
her
and
let
the
toads
boil
till
they
fell
to
bits
next
day
word
came
that
the
girl
was
dead
can
any
reasonable
man
doubt
that
the
witch
herself
was
boiled
alive
in
the
person
of
the
toads
moreover
just
as
a
witch
can
assume
the
form
of
an
animal
so
she
can
assume
the
form
of
some
other
human
being
and
the
likeness
is
sometimes
so
good
that
it
is
difficult
to
detect
the
fraud
however
by
burning
alive
the
person
whose
shape
the
witch
has
put
on
you
force
the
witch
to
disclose
herself
just
as
by
burning
alive
the
bewitched
animal
you
in
like
manner
oblige
the
witch
to
appear
this
principle
may
perhaps
be
unknown
to
science
falsely
so
called
but
it
is
well
understood
in
ireland
and
has
been
acted
on
within
recent
years
in
march
a
peasant
named
michael
cleary
residing
at
ballyvadlea
a
remote
and
lonely
district
in
the
county
of
tipperary
burned
his
wife
bridget
cleary
alive
over
a
slow
fire
on
the
kitchen
hearth
in
the
presence
of
and
with
the
active
assistance
of
some
neighbours
including
the
woman
s
own
father
and
several
of
her
cousins
they
thought
that
she
was
not
bridget
cleary
at
all
but
a
witch
and
that
when
they
held
her
down
on
the
fire
she
would
vanish
up
the
chimney
so
they
cried
while
she
was
burning
away
she
goes
away
she
goes
even
when
she
lay
quite
dead
on
the
kitchen
floor
for
contrary
to
the
general
expectation
she
did
not
disappear
up
the
chimney
her
husband
still
believed
that
the
woman
lying
there
was
a
witch
and
that
his
own
dear
wife
had
gone
with
the
fairies
to
the
old
or
fort
on
the
hill
of
kylenagranagh
where
he
would
see
her
at
night
riding
a
grey
horse
and
roped
to
the
saddle
and
that
he
would
cut
the
ropes
and
that
she
would
stay
with
him
ever
afterwards
so
he
went
with
some
friends
to
the
fort
night
after
night
taking
a
big
with
him
to
cut
the
ropes
but
he
never
saw
his
wife
again
he
and
the
men
who
had
held
the
woman
on
the
fire
were
arrested
and
tried
at
clonmel
for
wilful
murder
in
july
they
were
all
found
guilty
of
manslaughter
and
sentenced
to
various
terms
of
penal
servitude
and
imprisonment
the
sentence
passed
on
michael
cleary
was
twenty
years
penal
servitude
however
our
british
peasants
it
must
be
confessed
have
not
always
acted
up
to
the
strict
logical
theory
which
seems
to
call
for
death
by
fire
as
the
proper
treatment
both
of
bewitched
animals
and
of
witches
sometimes
perhaps
in
moments
of
weakness
they
have
merely
buried
the
bewitched
animals
alive
instead
of
burning
them
for
example
in
the
year
many
cattle
having
died
john
brughe
and
neane
nikclerith
also
one
of
the

conjoined
their
mutual
skill
for
the
safety
of
the
herd
the
surviving
animals
were
drove
past
a
tub
of
water
containing
two
enchanted
stones
and
each
was
sprinkled

the
liquid
contents

during
the
prevalence
of
a
murrain
about

certain
persons
proposed
to

with

of
a
celebrated
cureing
stane
of
which
the

of

of

eighteenth
century
john
ramsay
of
ochtertyre
tells
us
that
the
violent
death
even
of
a
brute
is
in
some
cases
held
to
be
of
great
avail
there
is
a
disease
called
the
which
sometimes
rages
like
a
pestilence
among
black
cattle
the
symptoms
of
which
are
a
mortification
in
the
legs
and
a
corruption
of
the
mass
of
blood
among
the
other
engines
of
superstition
that
are
directed
against
this
fatal
malady
the
first
cow
seized
with
it
is
commonly
buried
alive
and
the
other
cattle
are
forced
to
pass
backwards
and
forwards
over
the
pit
at
other
times
the
heart
is
taken
out
of
the
beast
alive
and
then
the
carcass
is
buried
it
is
remarkable
that
the
leg
affected
is
cut
off
and
hung
up
in
some
part
of
the
house
or
byre
where
it
remains
suspended
notwithstanding
the
seeming
danger
of
infection
there
is
hardly
a
house
in
mull
where
these
may
not
be
seen
this
practice
seems
to
have
taken
its
rise
antecedent
to
christianity
as
it
reminds
us
of
the
pagan
custom
of
hanging
up
offerings
in
their
temples
in
breadalbane
when
a
cow
is
observed
to
have
symptoms
of
madness
there
is
recourse
had
to
a
peculiar
process
they
tie
the
legs
of
the
mad
creature
and
throw
her
into
a
pit
dug
at
the
door
of
the
fold
after
covering
the
hole
with
earth
a
large
fire
is
kindled
upon
it
and
the
rest
of
the
cattle
are
driven
out
and
forced
to
pass
through
the
fire
one
by
in
this
latter
custom
we
may
suspect
that
the
fire
kindled
on
the
grave
of
the
buried
cow
was
originally
made
by
the
friction
of
wood
in
other
words
that
it
was
a
again
writing
in
the
year
sir
arthur
mitchell
tells
us
that
for
the
cure
of
the
murrain
in
cattle
one
of
the
herd
is
still
sacrificed
for
the
good
of
the
whole
this
is
done
by
burying
it
alive
i
am
assured
that
within
the
last
ten
years
such
a
barbarism
occurred
in
the
county
of
sometimes
however
the
animal
has
not
even
been
buried
alive
it
has
been
merely
killed
and
then
buried
in
this
emasculated
form
the
sacrifice
we
may
say
with
confidence
is
absolutely
useless
for
the
purpose
of
stopping
a
murrain
nevertheless
it
has
been
tried
thus
in
lincolnshire
when
the
cattle
plague
was
so
prevalent
in
there
was
i
believe
not
a
single
cowshed
in
marshland
but
had
its
wicken
cross
over
the
door
and
other
charms
more
powerful
than
this
were
in
some
cases
resorted
to
i
never
heard
of
the
use
of
the
needfire
in
the
marsh
though
it
was
i
believe
used
on
the
wolds
not
many
miles
off
but
i
knew
of
at
least
one
case
in
which
a
calf
was
killed
and
solemnly
buried
feet
pointing
upwards
at
the
threshold
of
the
cowshed
when
our
garthman
told
me
of
this
i
pointed
out
to
him
that
the
charm
had
failed
for
the
disease
had
not
spared
that
shed

chapter
the
interpretation
of
the
on
the
in
general
the
foregoing
survey
of
the
popular
of
europe
suggests
some
general
observations
in
the
first
place
we
can
hardly
help
being
struck
by
the
resemblance
which
the
ceremonies
bear
to
each
other
at
whatever
time
of
the
year
and
in
whatever
part
of
europe
they
are
celebrated
the
custom
of
kindling
great
bonfires
leaping
over
them
and
driving
cattle
through
or
round
them
would
seem
to
have
been
practically
universal
throughout
europe
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
processions
or
races
with
blazing
torches
round
fields
orchards
pastures
or
less
widespread
are
the
customs
of
hurling
lighted
discs
into
the
air
and
trundling
a
burning
wheel
down
hill
for
to
judge
by
the
evidence
which
i
have
collected
these
modes
of
distributing
the
beneficial
influence
of
the
fire
have
been
confined
in
the
main
to
central
europe
the
ceremonial
of
the
yule
log
is
distinguished
from
that
of
the
other
by
the
privacy
and
domesticity
which
characterize
it
but
as
we
have
already
seen
this
distinction
may
well
be
due
simply
to
the
rough
weather
of
midwinter
which
is
apt
not
only
to
render
a
public
assembly
in
the
open
air
disagreeable
but
also
at
any
moment
to
defeat
the
object
of
the
assembly
by
extinguishing
the
fire
under
a
downpour
of
rain
or
a
fall
of
snow
apart
from
these
local
or
seasonal
differences
the
general
resemblance
between
the
at
all
times
of
the
year
and
in
all
places
is
tolerably
close
and
as
the
ceremonies
themselves
resemble
each
other
so
do
the
benefits
which
the
people
expect
to
reap
from
them
whether
applied
in
the
form
of
bonfires
blazing
at
fixed
points
or
of
torches
carried
about
from
place
to
place
or
of
embers
and
ashes
taken
from
the
smouldering
heap
of
fuel
the
fire
is
believed
to
promote
the
growth
of
the
crops
and
the
welfare
of
man
and
beast
either
positively
by
stimulating
them
or
negatively
by
averting
the
dangers
and
calamities
which
threaten
them
from
such
causes
as
thunder
and
lightning
conflagration
blight
mildew
vermin
sterility
disease
and
not
least
of
all
witchcraft
but
we
naturally
ask
how
did
it
come
about
that
benefits
so
great
and
manifold
were
supposed
to
be
attained
by
means
so
simple
in
what
way
did
people
imagine
that
they
could
procure
so
many
goods
or
avoid
so
many
ills
by
the
application
of
fire
and
smoke
of
embers
and
ashes
in
short
what
theory
underlay
and
prompted
the
practice
of
these
customs
for
that
the
institution
of
the
festivals
was
the
outcome
of
a
definite
train
of
reasoning
may
be
taken
for
granted
the
view
that
primitive
man
acted
first
and
invented
his
reasons
to
suit
his
actions
afterwards
is
not
borne
out
by
what
we
know
of
his
nearest
living
representatives
the
savage
and
the
peasant
two
different
explanations
of
the
have
been
given
by
modern
enquirers
on
the
one
hand
it
has
been
held
that
they
are
or
magical
ceremonies
intended
on
the
principle
of
imitative
magic
to
ensure
a
needful
supply
of
sunshine
for
men
animals
and
plants
by
kindling
fires
which
mimic
on
earth
the
great
source
of
light
and
heat
in
the
sky
this
was
the
view
of
wilhelm
mannhardt
it
may
be
called
the
solar
theory
on
the
other
hand
it
has
been
maintained
that
the
ceremonial
fires
have
no
necessary
reference
to
the
sun
but
are
simply
purificatory
in
intention
being
designed
to
burn
up
and
destroy
all
harmful
influences
whether
these
are
conceived
in
a
personal
form
as
witches
demons
and
monsters
or
in
an
impersonal
form
as
a
sort
of
pervading
taint
or
corruption
of
the
air
this
is
the
view
of
edward
westermarck
and
apparently
of
professor
eugen
mogk
it
may
be
called
the
purificatory
theory
obviously
the
two
theories
postulate
two
very
different
conceptions
of
the
fire
which
plays
the
principal
part
in
the
rites
on
the
one
view
the
fire
like
sunshine
in
our
latitude
is
a
genial
creative
power
which
fosters
the
growth
of
plants
and
the
development
of
all
that
makes
for
health
and
happiness
on
the
other
view
the
fire
is
a
fierce
destructive
power
which
blasts
and
consumes
all
the
noxious
elements
whether
spiritual
or
material
that
menace
the
life
of
men
of
animals
and
of
plants
according
to
the
one
theory
the
fire
is
a
stimulant
according
to
the
other
it
is
a
disinfectant
on
the
one
view
its
virtue
is
positive
on
the
other
it
is
negative
yet
the
two
explanations
different
as
they
are
in
the
character
which
they
attribute
to
the
fire
are
perhaps
not
wholly
irreconcilable
if
we
assume
that
the
fires
kindled
at
these
festivals
were
primarily
intended
to
imitate
the
sun
s
light
and
heat
may
we
not
regard
the
purificatory
and
disinfecting
qualities
which
popular
opinion
certainly
appears
to
have
ascribed
to
them
as
attributes
derived
directly
from
the
purificatory
and
disinfecting
qualities
of
sunshine
in
this
way
we
might
conclude
that
while
the
imitation
of
sunshine
in
these
ceremonies
was
primary
and
original
the
purification
attributed
to
them
was
secondary
and
derivative
such
a
conclusion
occupying
an
intermediate
position
between
the
two
opposing
theories
and
recognizing
an
element
of
truth
in
both
of
them
was
adopted
by
me
in
earlier
editions
of
this
work
but
in
the
meantime
westermarck
has
argued
powerfully
in
favour
of
the
purificatory
theory
alone
and
i
am
bound
to
say
that
his
arguments
carry
great
weight
and
that
on
a
fuller
review
of
the
facts
the
balance
of
evidence
seems
to
me
to
incline
decidedly
in
his
favour
however
the
case
is
not
so
clear
as
to
justify
us
in
dismissing
the
solar
theory
without
discussion
and
accordingly
i
propose
to
adduce
the
considerations
which
tell
for
it
before
proceeding
to
notice
those
which
tell
against
it
a
theory
which
had
the
support
of
so
learned
and
sagacious
an
investigator
as
mannhardt
is
entitled
to
a
respectful
hearing
the
solar
theory
of
the
in
an
earlier
part
of
this
work
we
saw
that
savages
resort
to
charms
for
making
sunshine
and
it
would
be
no
wonder
if
primitive
man
in
europe
did
the
same
indeed
when
we
consider
the
cold
and
cloudy
climate
of
europe
during
a
great
part
of
the
year
we
shall
find
it
natural
that
should
have
played
a
much
more
prominent
part
among
the
superstitious
practices
of
european
peoples
than
among
those
of
savages
who
live
nearer
the
equator
and
who
consequently
are
apt
to
get
in
the
course
of
nature
more
sunshine
than
they
want
this
view
of
the
festivals
may
be
supported
by
various
arguments
drawn
partly
from
their
dates
partly
from
the
nature
of
the
rites
and
partly
from
the
influence
which
they
are
believed
to
exert
upon
the
weather
and
on
vegetation
first
in
regard
to
the
dates
of
the
festivals
it
can
be
no
mere
accident
that
two
of
the
most
important
and
widely
spread
of
the
festivals
are
timed
to
coincide
more
or
less
exactly
with
the
summer
and
winter
solstices
that
is
with
the
two
in
the
sun
s
apparent
course
in
the
sky
when
he
reaches
respectively
his
highest
and
his
lowest
elevation
at
noon
indeed
with
respect
to
the
midwinter
celebration
of
christmas
we
are
not
left
to
conjecture
we
know
from
the
express
testimony
of
the
ancients
that
it
was
instituted
by
the
church
to
supersede
an
old
heathen
festival
of
the
birth
of
the
sun
which
was
apparently
conceived
to
be
born
again
on
the
shortest
day
of
the
year
after
which
his
light
and
heat
were
seen
to
grow
till
they
attained
their
full
maturity
at
midsummer
therefore
it
is
no
very
conjecture
to
suppose
that
the
yule
log
which
figures
so
prominently
in
the
popular
celebration
of
christmas
was
originally
designed
to
help
the
labouring
sun
of
midwinter
to
rekindle
his
seemingly
expiring
light
the
idea
that
by
lighting
a
log
on
earth
you
can
rekindle
a
fire
in
heaven
or
fan
it
into
a
brighter
blaze
naturally
seems
to
us
absurd
but
to
the
savage
mind
it
wears
a
different
aspect
and
the
institution
of
the
great
which
we
are
considering
probably
dates
from
a
time
when
europe
was
still
sunk
in
savagery
or
at
most
in
barbarism
now
it
can
be
shewn
that
in
order
to
increase
the
celestial
source
of
heat
at
midwinter
savages
resort
to
a
practice
analogous
to
that
of
our
yule
log
if
the
kindling
of
the
yule
log
was
originally
a
magical
rite
intended
to
rekindle
the
sun
in
the
southern
hemisphere
where
the
order
of
the
seasons
is
the
reverse
of
ours
the
rising
of
sirius
or
the
dog
star
in
july
marks
the
season
of
the
greatest
cold
instead
of
as
with
us
the
greatest
heat
and
just
as
the
civilized
ancients
ascribed
the
torrid
heat
of
midsummer
to
that
brilliant
star
so
the
modern
savage
of
south
africa
attributes
to
it
the
piercing
cold
of
midwinter
and
seeks
to
mitigate
its
rigour
by
warming
up
the
chilly
star
with
the
genial
heat
of
the
sun
how
he
does
so
may
be
best
described
in
his
own
words
as
follows
the
bushmen
perceive
canopus
they
say
to
a
child
give
me
yonder
piece
of
wood
that
i
may
put
the
end
of
it
in
the
fire
that
i
may
point
it
burning
towards
grandmother
for
grandmother
carries
bushman
rice
grandmother
shall
make
a
little
warmth
for
us
for
she
coldly
comes
out
the

shall
warm
grandmother

eye
for
sirius

out
to
one

sirius
comes
yonder
they
say
to
one
another
ye
must
burn
a
stick
for
us
towards
they

to
one
another
who
was

who

one

to
the

our

i

the

says
to

i
wish
thee
to
burn
a

for

towards

that
the

may
shining
come
out
for
us
that
sirius
may
not
coldly
come
the

man
the
one
who
saw
sirius
says
to
his
son
bring
me
the
small
piece
of
wood
yonder
that
i
may
put
the
end
of
it
in
the
fire
that
i
may
burn
it
towards

that
grandmother
may
ascend
the
sky
like
the
other
one
the
child
brings
him
the
piece
of
wood
he
the
father
holds
the
end
of
it
in
the
fire
he
points
it
burning
towards
sirius
he
says
that
sirius
shall
twinkle
like
canopus
he
sings
he
sings
about
canopus
he
sings
about
sirius
he
points
to
them
with
fire
that
they
may
twinkle
like
each
other
he
throws
fire
at
them
he
covers
himself
up
entirely
including
his
head
in
his
kaross
and
lies
down
he
arises
he
sits
down
while
he
does
not
again
lie
down
because
he
feels
that
he
has
worked
putting
sirius
into
the
sun
s
warmth
so
that
sirius
may
warmly
come
out
the
women
go
out
early
to
seek
for
bushman
rice
they
walk
sunning
their
shoulder
what
the
bushmen
thus
do
to
temper
the
cold
of
midwinter
in
the
southern
hemisphere
by
blowing
up
the
celestial
fires
may
have
been
done
by
our
rude
forefathers
at
the
corresponding
season
in
the
northern
hemisphere
not
only
the
date
of
some
of
the
festivals
but
the
manner
of
their
celebration
suggests
a
conscious
imitation
of
the
sun
the
custom
of
rolling
a
burning
wheel
down
a
hill
which
is
often
observed
at
these
ceremonies
might
well
pass
for
an
imitation
of
the
sun
s
course
in
the
sky
and
the
imitation
would
be
especially
appropriate
on
midsummer
day
when
the
sun
s
annual
declension
begins
indeed
the
custom
has
been
thus
interpreted
by
some
of
those
who
have
recorded
it
not
less
graphic
it
may
be
said
is
the
mimicry
of
his
apparent
revolution
by
swinging
a
burning
round
a
pole
again
the
common
practice
of
throwing
fiery
discs
sometimes
expressly
said
to
be
shaped
like
suns
into
the
air
at
the
festivals
may
well
be
a
piece
of
imitative
magic
in
these
as
in
so
many
cases
the
magic
force
may
be
supposed
to
take
effect
through
mimicry
or
sympathy
by
imitating
the
desired
result
you
actually
produce
it
by
counterfeiting
the
sun
s
progress
through
the
heavens
you
really
help
the
luminary
to
pursue
his
celestial
journey
with
punctuality
and
despatch
the
name
fire
of
heaven
by
which
the
midsummer
fire
is
sometimes
popularly
known
clearly
implies
a
consciousness
of
a
connexion
between
the
earthly
and
the
heavenly
flame
again
the
manner
in
which
the
fire
appears
to
have
been
originally
kindled
on
these
occasions
has
been
alleged
in
support
of
the
view
that
it
was
intended
to
be
a
as
some
scholars
have
perceived
it
is
highly
probable
that
at
the
periodic
festivals
in
former
times
fire
was
universally
obtained
by
the
friction
of
two
pieces
of
wood
we
have
seen
that
it
is
still
so
procured
in
some
places
both
at
the
easter
and
the
midsummer
festivals
and
that
it
is
expressly
said
to
have
been
formerly
so
procured
at
the
beltane
celebration
both
in
scotland
and
wales
but
what
makes
it
nearly
certain
that
this
was
once
the
invariable
mode
of
kindling
the
fire
at
these
periodic
festivals
is
the
analogy
of
the
which
has
almost
always
been
produced
by
the
friction
of
wood
and
sometimes
by
the
revolution
of
a
wheel
it
is
a
plausible
conjecture
that
the
wheel
employed
for
this
purpose
represents
the
sun
and
if
the
fires
at
the
regularly
recurring
celebrations
were
formerly
produced
in
the
same
way
it
might
be
regarded
as
a
confirmation
of
the
view
that
they
were
originally
in
point
of
fact
there
is
as
kuhn
has
indicated
some
evidence
to
shew
that
the
midsummer
fire
was
originally
thus
produced
we
have
seen
that
many
hungarian
make
fire
on
midsummer
eve
by
rotating
a
wheel
round
a
wooden
axle
wrapt
in
hemp
and
that
they
drive
their
pigs
through
the
fire
thus
made
at
obermedlingen
in
swabia
the
fire
of
heaven
as
it
was
called
was
made
on
vitus
s
day
the
fifteenth
of
june
by
igniting
a
which
smeared
with
pitch
and
plaited
with
straw
was
fastened
on
a
pole
twelve
feet
high
the
top
of
the
pole
being
inserted
in
the
nave
of
the
wheel
this
fire
was
made
on
the
summit
of
a
mountain
and
as
the
flame
ascended
the
people
uttered
a
set
form
of
words
with
eyes
and
arms
directed
heavenward
here
the
fixing
of
a
wheel
on
a
pole
and
igniting
it
suggests
that
originally
the
fire
was
produced
as
in
the
case
of
the
by
the
revolution
of
a
wheel
the
day
on
which
the
ceremony
takes
place
the
fifteenth
of
june
is
near
midsummer
and
we
have
seen
that
in
masuren
fire
is
or
used
to
be
actually
made
on
midsummer
day
by
turning
a
wheel
rapidly
about
an
oaken
pole
though
it
is
not
said
that
the
new
fire
so
obtained
is
used
to
light
a
bonfire
however
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
in
all
such
cases
the
use
of
a
wheel
may
be
merely
a
mechanical
device
to
facilitate
the
operation
of
by
increasing
the
friction
it
need
not
have
any
symbolical
significance
further
the
influence
which
these
fires
whether
periodic
or
occasional
are
supposed
to
exert
on
the
weather
and
vegetation
may
be
cited
in
support
of
the
view
that
they
are
since
the
effects
ascribed
to
them
resemble
those
of
sunshine
thus
the
french
belief
that
in
a
rainy
june
the
lighting
of
the
midsummer
bonfires
will
cause
the
rain
to
cease
appears
to
assume
that
they
can
disperse
the
dark
clouds
and
make
the
sun
to
break
out
in
radiant
glory
drying
the
wet
earth
and
dripping
trees
similarly
the
use
of
the
by
swiss
children
on
foggy
days
for
the
purpose
of
clearing
away
the
mist
may
very
naturally
be
interpreted
as
a
again
we
have
seen
that
in
the
vosges
mountains
the
people
believe
that
the
midsummer
fires
help
to
preserve
the
fruits
of
the
earth
and
ensure
good
crops
in
sweden
the
warmth
or
cold
of
the
coming
season
is
inferred
from
the
direction
in
which
the
flames
of
the
may
day
bonfire
are
blown
if
they
blow
to
the
south
it
will
be
warm
if
to
the
north
cold
no
doubt
at
present
the
direction
of
the
flames
is
regarded
merely
as
an
augury
of
the
weather
not
as
a
mode
of
influencing
it
but
we
may
be
pretty
sure
that
this
is
one
of
the
cases
in
which
magic
has
dwindled
into
divination
so
in
the
eifel
mountains
when
the
smoke
blows
towards
the
this
is
an
omen
that
the
harvest
will
be
abundant
but
the
older
view
may
have
been
not
merely
that
the
smoke
and
flames
prognosticated
but
that
they
actually
produced
an
abundant
harvest
the
heat
of
the
flames
acting
like
sunshine
on
the
corn
perhaps
it
was
with
this
view
that
people
in
the
isle
of
man
lit
fires
to
windward
of
their
fields
in
order
that
the
smoke
might
blow
over
them
so
in
south
africa
about
the
month
of
april
the
matabeles
light
huge
fires
to
the
windward
of
their
gardens
their
idea
being
that
the
smoke
by
passing
over
the
crops
will
assist
the
ripening
of
among
the
zulus
also
medicine
is
burned
on
a
fire
placed
to
windward
of
the
garden
the
fumigation
which
the
plants
in
consequence
receive
being
held
to
improve
the
again
the
idea
of
our
european
peasants
that
the
corn
will
grow
well
as
far
as
the
blaze
of
the
bonfire
is
visible
may
be
interpreted
as
a
remnant
of
the
belief
in
the
quickening
and
fertilizing
power
of
the
bonfires
the
same
belief
it
may
be
argued
reappears
in
the
notion
that
embers
taken
from
the
bonfires
and
inserted
in
the
fields
will
promote
the
growth
of
the
crops
and
it
may
be
thought
to
underlie
the
customs
of
sowing
in
the
direction
in
which
the
flames
blow
of
mixing
the
ashes
of
the
bonfire
with
the
at
sowing
of
scattering
the
ashes
by
themselves
over
the
field
to
fertilize
it
and
of
incorporating
a
piece
of
the
yule
log
in
the
plough
to
make
the
seeds
thrive
the
opinion
that
the
flax
or
hemp
will
grow
as
high
as
the
flames
rise
or
the
people
leap
over
them
belongs
clearly
to
the
same
class
of
ideas
again
at
konz
on
the
banks
of
the
moselle
if
the
blazing
wheel
which
was
trundled
down
the
hillside
reached
the
river
without
being
extinguished
this
was
hailed
as
a
proof
that
the
vintage
would
be
abundant
so
firmly
was
this
belief
held
that
the
successful
performance
of
the
ceremony
entitled
the
villagers
to
levy
a
tax
upon
the
owners
of
the
neighbouring
vineyards
here
the
unextinguished
wheel
might
be
taken
to
represent
an
unclouded
sun
which
in
turn
would
portend
an
abundant
vintage
so
the
of
white
wine
which
the
villagers
received
from
the
vineyards
round
about
might
pass
for
a
payment
for
the
sunshine
which
they
had
procured
for
the
grapes
similarly
we
saw
that
in
the
vale
of
glamorgan
a
blazing
wheel
used
to
be
trundled
down
hill
on
midsummer
day
and
that
if
the
fire
were
extinguished
before
the
wheel
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
people
expected
a
bad
harvest
whereas
if
the
wheel
kept
alight
all
the
way
down
and
continued
to
blaze
for
a
long
time
the
farmers
looked
forward
to
heavy
crops
that
summer
here
again
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
the
rustic
mind
traced
a
direct
connexion
between
the
fire
of
the
wheel
and
the
fire
of
the
sun
on
which
the
crops
are
dependent
but
in
popular
belief
the
quickening
and
fertilizing
influence
of
the
bonfires
is
not
limited
to
the
vegetable
world
it
extends
also
to
animals
this
plainly
appears
from
the
irish
custom
of
driving
barren
cattle
through
the
fires
from
the
french
belief
that
the
steeped
in
water
helps
cows
to
calve
from
the
french
and
servian
notion
that
there
will
be
as
many
chickens
calves
lambs
and
kids
as
there
are
sparks
struck
out
of
the
yule
log
from
the
french
custom
of
putting
the
ashes
of
the
bonfires
in
the
fowls
nests
to
make
the
hens
lay
eggs
and
from
the
german
practice
of
mixing
the
ashes
of
the
bonfires
with
the
drink
of
cattle
in
order
to
make
the
animals
thrive
further
there
are
clear
indications
that
even
human
fecundity
is
supposed
to
be
promoted
by
the
genial
heat
of
the
fires
in
morocco
the
people
think
that
childless
couples
can
obtain
offspring
by
leaping
over
the
midsummer
bonfire
it
is
an
irish
belief
that
a
girl
who
jumps
thrice
over
the
midsummer
bonfire
will
soon
marry
and
become
the
mother
of
many
children
in
flanders
women
leap
over
the
midsummer
fires
to
ensure
an
easy
delivery
and
in
various
parts
of
france
they
think
that
if
a
girl
dances
round
nine
fires
she
will
be
sure
to
marry
within
the
year
on
the
other
hand
in
lechrain
people
say
that
if
a
young
man
and
woman
leaping
over
the
midsummer
fire
together
escape
unsmirched
the
young
woman
will
not
become
a
mother
within
twelve
months
the
flames
have
not
touched
and
fertilized
her
in
parts
of
switzerland
and
france
the
lighting
of
the
yule
log
is
accompanied
by
a
prayer
that
the
women
may
bear
children
the
bring
forth
kids
and
the
ewes
drop
lambs
the
rule
observed
in
some
places
that
the
bonfires
should
be
kindled
by
the
person
who
was
last
married
seems
to
belong
to
the
same
class
of
ideas
whether
it
be
that
such
a
person
is
supposed
to
receive
from
or
to
impart
to
the
fire
a
generative
and
fertilizing
influence
the
common
practice
of
lovers
leaping
over
the
fires
hand
in
hand
may
very
well
have
originated
in
a
notion
that
thereby
their
marriage
would
be
blessed
with
offspring
and
the
like
motive
would
explain
the
custom
which
obliges
couples
married
within
the
year
to
dance
to
the
light
of
torches
and
the
scenes
of
profligacy
which
appear
to
have
marked
the
midsummer
celebration
among
the
esthonians
as
they
once
marked
the
celebration
of
may
day
among
ourselves
may
have
sprung
not
from
the
mere
license
of
but
from
a
crude
notion
that
such
orgies
were
justified
if
not
required
by
some
mysterious
bond
which
linked
the
life
of
man
to
the
courses
of
the
heavens
at
this
of
the
year
at
the
festivals
which
we
are
considering
the
custom
of
kindling
bonfires
is
commonly
associated
with
a
custom
of
carrying
lighted
torches
about
the
fields
the
orchards
the
pastures
the
flocks
and
the
herds
and
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
the
two
customs
are
only
two
different
ways
of
attaining
the
same
object
namely
the
benefits
which
are
believed
to
flow
from
the
fire
whether
it
be
stationary
or
portable
accordingly
if
we
accept
the
solar
theory
of
the
bonfires
we
seem
bound
to
apply
it
also
to
the
torches
we
must
suppose
that
the
practice
of
marching
or
running
with
blazing
torches
about
the
country
is
simply
a
means
of
diffusing
far
and
wide
the
genial
influence
of
the
sunshine
of
which
these
flickering
flames
are
a
feeble
imitation
in
favour
of
this
view
it
may
be
said
that
sometimes
the
torches
are
carried
about
the
fields
for
the
express
purpose
of
fertilizing
them
and
for
the
same
purpose
live
coals
from
the
bonfires
are
sometimes
placed
in
the
fields
to
prevent
on
the
eve
of
twelfth
day
in
normandy
men
women
and
children
run
wildly
through
the
fields
and
orchards
with
lighted
torches
which
they
wave
about
the
branches
and
dash
against
the
trunks
of
the
for
the
sake
of
burning
the
moss
and
driving
away
the
moles
and
field
mice
they
believe
that
the
ceremony
fulfils
the
double
object
of
exorcizing
the
vermin
whose
multiplication
would
be
a
real
calamity
and
of
imparting
fecundity
to
the
trees
the
fields
and
even
the
cattle
and
they
imagine
that
the
more
the
ceremony
is
prolonged
the
greater
will
be
the
crop
of
fruit
next
autumn
in
bohemia
they
say
that
the
corn
will
grow
as
high
as
they
fling
the
blazing
besoms
into
the
air
nor
are
such
notions
confined
to
europe
in
corea
a
few
days
before
the
new
year
festival
the
eunuchs
of
the
palace
swing
burning
torches
chanting
invocations
the
while
and
this
is
supposed
to
ensure
bountiful
crops
for
the
next
season
the
custom
of
trundling
a
burning
wheel
over
the
fields
which
used
to
be
observed
in
poitou
for
the
express
purpose
of
fertilizing
them
may
be
thought
to
embody
the
same
idea
in
a
still
more
graphic
form
since
in
this
way
the
itself
not
merely
its
light
and
heat
represented
by
torches
is
made
actually
to
pass
over
the
ground
which
is
to
receive
its
quickening
and
kindly
influence
once
more
the
custom
of
carrying
lighted
brands
round
cattle
is
plainly
equivalent
to
driving
the
animals
through
the
bonfire
and
if
the
bonfire
is
a
the
torches
must
be
so
also
the
purificatory
theory
of
the
thus
far
we
have
considered
what
may
be
said
for
the
theory
that
at
the
european
the
fire
is
kindled
as
a
charm
to
ensure
an
abundant
supply
of
sunshine
for
man
and
beast
for
corn
and
fruits
it
remains
to
consider
what
may
be
said
against
this
theory
and
in
favour
of
the
view
that
in
these
rites
fire
is
employed
not
as
a
creative
but
as
a
cleansing
agent
which
purifies
men
animals
and
plants
by
burning
up
and
consuming
the
noxious
elements
whether
material
or
spiritual
which
menace
all
living
things
with
disease
and
death
first
then
it
is
to
be
observed
that
the
people
who
practise
the
appear
never
to
allege
the
solar
theory
in
explanation
of
them
while
on
the
contrary
they
do
frequently
and
emphatically
put
forward
the
purificatory
theory
this
is
a
strong
argument
in
favour
of
the
purificatory
and
against
the
solar
theory
for
the
popular
explanation
of
a
popular
custom
is
never
to
be
rejected
except
for
grave
cause
and
in
the
present
case
there
seems
to
be
no
adequate
reason
for
rejecting
it
the
conception
of
fire
as
a
destructive
agent
which
can
be
turned
to
account
for
the
consumption
of
evil
things
is
so
simple
and
obvious
that
it
could
hardly
escape
the
minds
even
of
the
rude
peasantry
with
whom
these
festivals
originated
on
the
other
hand
the
conception
of
fire
as
an
emanation
of
the
sun
or
at
all
events
as
linked
to
it
by
a
bond
of
physical
sympathy
is
far
less
simple
and
obvious
and
though
the
use
of
fire
as
a
charm
to
produce
sunshine
appears
to
be
undeniable
nevertheless
in
attempting
to
explain
popular
customs
we
should
never
have
recourse
to
a
more
recondite
idea
when
a
simpler
one
lies
to
hand
and
is
supported
by
the
explicit
testimony
of
the
people
themselves
now
in
the
case
of
the
the
destructive
aspect
of
fire
is
one
upon
which
the
people
dwell
again
and
again
and
it
is
highly
significant
that
the
great
evil
against
which
the
fire
is
directed
appears
to
be
witchcraft
again
and
again
we
are
told
that
the
fires
are
intended
to
burn
or
repel
the
witches
and
the
intention
is
sometimes
graphically
expressed
by
burning
an
effigy
of
a
witch
in
the
fire
hence
when
we
remember
the
great
hold
which
the
dread
of
witchcraft
has
had
on
the
popular
european
mind
in
all
ages
we
may
suspect
that
the
primary
intention
of
all
these
was
simply
to
destroy
or
at
all
events
get
rid
of
the
witches
who
were
regarded
as
the
causes
of
nearly
all
the
misfortunes
and
calamities
that
befall
men
their
cattle
and
their
crops
this
suspicion
is
confirmed
when
we
examine
the
evils
for
which
the
bonfires
and
torches
were
supposed
to
provide
a
remedy
foremost
perhaps
among
these
evils
we
may
reckon
the
diseases
of
cattle
and
of
all
the
ills
that
witches
are
believed
to
work
there
is
probably
none
which
is
so
constantly
insisted
on
as
the
harm
they
do
to
the
herds
particularly
by
stealing
the
milk
from
the
cows
now
it
is
significant
that
the
which
may
perhaps
be
regarded
as
the
parent
of
the
periodic
is
kindled
above
all
as
a
remedy
for
a
murrain
or
other
disease
of
cattle
and
the
circumstance
suggests
what
on
general
grounds
seems
probable
that
the
custom
of
kindling
the
goes
back
to
a
time
when
the
ancestors
of
the
european
peoples
subsisted
chiefly
on
the
products
of
their
herds
and
when
agriculture
as
yet
played
a
subordinate
part
in
their
lives
witches
and
wolves
are
the
two
great
foes
still
dreaded
by
the
herdsman
in
many
parts
of
europe
and
we
need
not
wonder
that
he
should
resort
to
fire
as
a
powerful
means
of
banning
them
both
among
slavonic
peoples
it
appears
that
the
foes
whom
the
is
designed
to
combat
are
not
so
much
living
witches
as
vampyres
and
other
evil
spirits
and
the
ceremony
as
we
saw
aims
rather
at
repelling
these
baleful
beings
than
at
actually
consuming
them
in
the
flames
but
for
our
present
purpose
these
distinctions
are
immaterial
the
important
thing
to
observe
is
that
among
the
slavs
the
which
is
probably
the
original
of
all
the
ceremonial
fires
now
under
consideration
is
not
a
but
clearly
and
unmistakably
nothing
but
a
means
of
protecting
man
and
beast
against
the
attacks
of
maleficent
creatures
whom
the
peasant
thinks
to
burn
or
scare
by
the
heat
of
the
fire
just
as
he
might
burn
or
scare
wild
animals
again
the
bonfires
are
often
supposed
to
protect
the
fields
against
hail
and
the
homestead
against
thunder
and
lightning
but
both
hail
and
thunderstorms
are
frequently
thought
to
be
caused
by
witches
hence
the
fire
which
bans
the
witches
necessarily
serves
at
the
same
time
as
a
talisman
against
hail
thunder
and
lightning
further
brands
taken
from
the
bonfires
are
commonly
kept
in
the
houses
to
guard
them
against
conflagration
and
though
this
may
perhaps
be
done
on
the
principle
of
homoeopathic
magic
one
fire
being
thought
to
act
as
a
preventive
of
another
it
is
also
possible
that
the
intention
may
be
to
keep
at
bay
again
people
leap
over
the
bonfires
as
a
preventive
of
colic
and
look
at
the
flames
steadily
in
order
to
preserve
their
eyes
in
good
health
and
both
colic
and
sore
eyes
are
in
germany
and
probably
elsewhere
set
down
to
the
machinations
of
witches
once
more
to
leap
over
the
midsummer
fires
or
to
circumambulate
them
is
thought
to
prevent
a
person
from
feeling
pains
in
his
back
at
reaping
and
in
germany
such
pains
are
called
and
ascribed
to
witchcraft
but
if
the
bonfires
and
torches
of
the
are
to
be
regarded
primarily
as
weapons
directed
against
witches
and
wizards
it
becomes
probable
that
the
same
explanation
applies
not
only
to
the
flaming
discs
which
are
hurled
into
the
air
but
also
to
the
burning
wheels
which
are
rolled
down
hill
on
these
occasions
discs
and
wheels
we
may
suppose
are
alike
intended
to
burn
the
witches
who
hover
invisible
in
the
air
or
haunt
unseen
the
fields
the
orchards
and
the
vineyards
on
the
hillside
certainly
witches
are
constantly
thought
to
ride
through
the
air
on
broomsticks
or
other
equally
convenient
vehicles
and
if
they
do
so
how
can
you
get
at
them
so
effectually
as
by
hurling
lighted
missiles
whether
discs
torches
or
besoms
after
them
as
they
flit
past
overhead
in
the
gloom
the
south
slavonian
peasant
believes
that
witches
ride
in
the
dark
so
he
shoots
at
the
clouds
to
bring
down
the
hags
while
he
curses
them
saying
curse
curse
herodias
thy
mother
is
a
heathen
damned
of
god
and
fettered
through
the
redeemer
s
also
he
brings
out
a
pot
of
glowing
charcoal
on
which
he
has
thrown
holy
oil
laurel
leaves
and
wormwood
to
make
a
smoke
the
fumes
are
supposed
to
ascend
to
the
clouds
and
stupefy
the
witches
so
that
they
tumble
down
to
earth
and
in
order
that
they
may
not
fall
soft
but
may
hurt
themselves
very
much
the
yokel
hastily
brings
out
a
chair
and
tilts
it
bottom
up
so
that
the
witch
in
falling
may
break
her
legs
on
the
legs
of
the
chair
worse
than
that
he
cruelly
lays
scythes
and
other
formidable
weapons
edge
upwards
so
as
to
cut
and
mangle
the
poor
wretches
when
they
drop
plump
upon
them
from
the
clouds
on
this
view
the
fertility
supposed
to
follow
the
application
of
fire
in
the
form
of
bonfires
torches
discs
rolling
wheels
and
so
forth
is
not
conceived
as
resulting
directly
from
an
increase
of
solar
heat
which
the
fire
has
magically
generated
it
is
merely
an
indirect
result
obtained
by
freeing
the
reproductive
powers
of
plants
and
animals
from
the
fatal
obstruction
of
witchcraft
and
what
is
true
of
the
reproduction
of
plants
and
animals
may
hold
good
also
of
the
fertility
of
the
human
sexes
we
have
seen
that
the
bonfires
are
supposed
to
promote
marriage
and
to
procure
offspring
for
childless
couples
this
happy
effect
need
not
flow
directly
from
any
quickening
or
fertilizing
energy
in
the
fire
it
may
follow
indirectly
from
the
power
of
the
fire
to
remove
those
obstacles
which
the
spells
of
witches
and
wizards
notoriously
present
to
the
union
of
man
and
wife
on
the
whole
then
the
theory
of
the
purificatory
virtue
of
the
ceremonial
fires
appears
more
probable
and
more
in
accordance
with
the
evidence
than
the
opposing
theory
of
their
connexion
with
the
sun
but
europe
is
not
the
only
part
of
the
world
where
ceremonies
of
this
sort
have
been
performed
elsewhere
the
passage
through
the
flames
or
smoke
or
over
the
glowing
embers
of
a
bonfire
which
is
the
central
feature
of
most
of
the
rites
has
been
employed
as
a
cure
or
a
preventive
of
various
ills
we
have
seen
that
the
midsummer
ritual
of
fire
in
morocco
is
practically
identical
with
that
of
our
european
peasantry
and
customs
more
or
less
similar
have
been
observed
by
many
races
in
various
parts
of
the
world
a
consideration
of
some
of
them
may
help
us
to
decide
between
the
conflicting
claims
of
the
two
rival
theories
which
explain
the
ceremonies
as
or
purifications

in
such
cases
the
beating
or
stinging
was
originally
a
purification
at
a
later
time
it
is
interpreted
as
a
test
of
courage
and
endurance
as
a
confirmation
of
this
view
it
may
be
pointed
out
that
beating
or
scourging
is
inflicted
on
inanimate
objects
expressly
for
the
purpose
indicated
in
the
text
thus
the
indians
of
costa
rica
hold
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
ceremonial
uncleanness
and
anything
that
has
been
connected
with
a
death
is
but
is
much
more
virulent
it
can
not
only
make
one
sick
but
kill
emanates
in
a
variety
of
ways
arms
utensils
even
houses
become
affected
by
it
after
long
disuse
and
before
they
can
be
used
again
must
be
purified
in
the
case
of
portable
objects
left
undisturbed
for
a
long
time
the
custom
is
to
beat
them
with
a
stick
before
touching
them
i
have
seen
a
woman
take
a
long
and
beat
a
basket
hanging
from
the
roof
of
a
house
by
a
cord
on
asking
what
that
was
for
i
was
told
that
the
basket
contained
her
treasures
that
she
would
probably
want
to
take
something
out
the
next
day
and
that
she
was
driving
off
the
a
house
long
unused
must
be
swept
and
then
the
person
who
is
purifying
it
must
take
a
stick
and
beat
not
only
the
movable
objects
but
the
beds
posts
and
in
short
every
accessible
part
of
the
interior
the
next
day

exposure

since
nobody
had
ever
been
on
it
one
day
gabb
took
down
some
dusty
amid
cries
of
from
the
indians
some
weeks
afterwards
a
boy
died
and
the
indians
firmly
believed
that
the
of
the
had
killed
him
from
all
the
foregoing
it
would
seem
that
is
a
sort
of
evil
spirit
that
takes
possession
of
the
object
and
resents
being
disturbed
but
i
have
never
been
able
to
learn
from
the
indians
that
they
consider
it
so
they
seem
to
think
of
it
as
a
property
the
object
acquires
but
the
worst
of
all
is
that
of
a
young
woman
in
her
first
pregnancy
she
infects
the
whole
neighbourhood
persons
going
from
the
house
where
she
lives

the
infection
with
them
to
a
distance
and
all
the
deaths
or
other
serious
misfortunes
in
the
vicinity
are
laid
to
her
charge
in
the
old
times
when
the
savage
laws
and
customs
were
in
full
force
it
was
not

of
rekindling
the
sacred
fire
by

s

reflected
from

mirror
but
he
seems
to
be
referring

than
to

whose

it
was
to
relight
the
sacred
fire
as
well
as
to
preserve
it
when
it
was
once
made
is
perhaps
explained
by
a
superstition
current
among
french
peasants
that
if
a
girl
can
blow
up
a
smouldering
candle
into
a
flame
she
is
a
virgin

that

she
fails

at

it

more
likely
that
the

sprang
from
a

of

from

the

absurd

that

was
the

circle
about

cattle
belonging
to

a
man
carried
fire
in

and
went
round
and
it
was
called
from
the

hand
which
in
the
ancient
language
is
called
there
is
another
way
of
the
or
carrying
fire
round
about
women
before
they
are
churched
after
and
it
is
used
likewise
about
children
until
they
are
christened
both
which
are
performed
in
the
morning
and
at
night
this
is
only
practised
now
by
some
of
the
ancient
midwives
i
enquired
their
reason
for
this
custom
which
i
told
them
was
altogether
unlawful
this
disobliged
them
mightily
insomuch
that
they
would
give
me
no
satisfaction
but
others
that
were
of
a
more
agreeable
temper
told
me
that
was
an
effectual
means
to
preserve
both
the
mother
and
the
infant
from
the
power
of
evil
spirits
who
are
ready
at
such
times
to
do
mischief
and
sometimes
carry
away
the
infant
and
when
they
get
them
once
in
their
possession
return
them
poor
meagre
skeletons
and
these
infants
are
said
to
have
voracious
appetites
constantly
craving
for
meat
in
this
case
it
was
usual
with
those
who
believed
that
their
children
were
thus
taken
away
to
dig
a
grave
in
the
fields
upon
and
there
to
lay
the
fairy
skeleton
till
next
morning
at
which
time
the
parents
went
to
the
place
where
they
doubted
not
to
find
their
own
child
instead
of
this
skeleton
some
of
the
poorer
sort
of
people
in
these
islands
retain
the
custom
of
performing
these
rounds
about
the
persons
of
their
benefactors
three
times
when
they
bless
them
and
wish
good
success
to
all
their
enterprizes
some
are
very
careful
when
they
set
out
to
sea
that
the
boat
be
first
rowed
about
and
if
this
be
neglected
they
are
afraid
their
voyage
may
prove
probably
the
superstition
was
based
entirely
on
the
supposed
luckiness
of
the
right
hand
which
accordingly
in
making
a
circuit
round
an
object
is
kept
towards

with
the
notion
that
the

is
poisoned
at
midsummer
we
may
compare
the
popular
belief
that
it
is
similarly
infected
at
an
eclipse
thus
among
the
esquimaux
on
the
lower
yukon
river
in
alaska
it
is
believed
that
a
subtle
essence
or
unclean
influence
descends
to
the
earth
during
an
eclipse
and
if
any
of
it
is
caught
in
utensils
of
any
kind
it
will
produce
sickness
as
a
result
immediately
on
the
commencement
of

similar

poison

at
such
a
time
they

they
bring

into

stalls

refrain
from

kind

lasts
long

people
get
