influence
of
character
unless
above
himself
he
can
erect
himself
how
poor
a

daniel
character
is
moral
order
seen
through
the
medium
of
an
individual
nature
men
of
character
are
the
conscience
of
the
society
to
which
they
emerson
the
prosperity
of
a
country
depends
not
on
the
abundance
of
its
revenues
nor
on
the
strength
of
its
fortifications
nor
on
the
beauty
of
its
public
buildings
but
it
consists
in
the
number
of
its
cultivated
citizens
in
its
men
of
education
enlightenment
and
character
here
are
to
be
found
its
true
interest
its
chief
strength
its
real
power
martin
luther
character
is
one
of
the
greatest
motive
powers
in
the
world
in
its
noblest
embodiments
it
exemplifies
human
nature
in
its
highest
forms
for
it
exhibits
man
at
his
best
men
of
genuine
excellence
in
every
station
of
life
men
of
industry
of
integrity
of
high
principle
of
sterling
honesty
of
purpose
command
the
spontaneous
homage
of
mankind
it
is
natural
to
believe
in
such
men
to
have
confidence
in
them
and
to
imitate
them
all
that
is
good
in
the
world
is
upheld
by
them
and
without
their
presence
in
it
the
world
would
not
be
worth
living
in
although
genius
always
commands
admiration
character
most
secures
respect
the
former
is
more
the
product
of
the
latter
of
and
in
the
long
run
it
is
the
heart
that
rules
in
life
men
of
genius
stand
to
society
in
the
relation
of
its
intellect
as
men
of
character
of
its
conscience
and
while
the
former
are
admired
the
latter
are
followed
great
men
are
always
exceptional
men
and
greatness
itself
is
but
comparative
indeed
the
range
of
most
men
in
life
is
so
limited
that
very
few
have
the
opportunity
of
being
great
but
each
man
can
act
his
part
honestly
and
honourably
and
to
the
best
of
his
ability
he
can
use
his
gifts
and
not
abuse
them
he
can
strive
to
make
the
best
of
life
he
can
be
true
just
honest
and
faithful
even
in
small
things
in
a
word
he
can
do
his
duty
in
that
sphere
in
which
providence
has
placed
him
commonplace
though
it
may
appear
this
doing
of
one
duty
embodies
the
highest
ideal
of
life
and
character
there
may
be
nothing
heroic
about
it
but
the
common
lot
of
men
is
not
heroic
and
though
the
abiding
sense
of
duty
upholds
man
in
his
highest
attitudes
it
also
equally
sustains
him
in
the
transaction
of
the
ordinary
affairs
of
everyday
existence
man
life
is
centred
in
the
sphere
of
common
duties
the
most
influential
of
all
the
virtues
are
those
which
are
the
most
in
request
for
daily
use
they
wear
the
best
and
last
the
longest
superfine
virtues
which
are
above
the
standard
of
common
men
may
only
be
sources
of
temptation
and
danger
burke
has
truly
said
that
the
human
system
which
rests
for
its
basis
on
the
heroic
virtues
is
sure
to
have
a
superstructure
of
weakness
or
of
profligacy
when
abbot
afterwards
archbishop
of
canterbury
drew
the
character
of
his
deceased
friend
thomas
sackville
he
did
not
dwell
upon
his
merits
as
a
statesman
or
his
genius
as
a
poet
but
upon
his
virtues
as
a
man
in
relation
to
the
ordinary
duties
of
life
how
many
rare
things
were
in
him
said
he
who
more
loving
unto
his
wife
who
more
kind
unto
his
children
who
more
fast
unto
his
friend
who
more
moderate
unto
his
enemy
who
more
true
to
his
word
indeed
we
can
always
better
understand
and
appreciate
a
man
real
character
by
the
manner
in
which
he
conducts
himself
towards
those
who
are
the
most
nearly
related
to
him
and
by
his
transaction
of
the
seemingly
commonplace
details
of
daily
duty
than
by
his
public
exhibition
of
himself
as
an
author
an
orator
or
a
statesman
at
the
same
time
while
duty
for
the
most
part
applies
to
the
conduct
of
affairs
in
common
life
by
the
average
of
common
men
it
is
also
a
sustaining
power
to
men
of
the
very
highest
standard
of
character
they
may
not
have
either
money
or
property
or
learning
or
power
and
yet
they
may
be
strong
in
heart
and
rich
in
spirit
honest
truthful
dutiful
and
whoever
strives
to
do
his
duty
faithfully
is
fulfilling
the
purpose
for
which
he
was
created
and
building
up
in
himself
the
principles
of
a
manly
character
there
are
many
persons
of
whom
it
may
be
said
that
they
have
no
other
possession
in
the
world
but
their
character
and
yet
they
stand
as
firmly
upon
it
as
any
crowned
king
intellectual
culture
has
no
necessary
relation
to
purity
or
excellence
of
character
in
the
new
testament
appeals
are
constantly
made
to
the
heart
of
man
and
to
the
spirit
we
are
of
whilst
allusions
to
the
intellect
are
of
very
rare
occurrence
a
handful
of
good
life
says
george
herbert
is
worth
a
bushel
of
learning
not
that
learning
is
to
be
despised
but
that
it
must
be
allied
to
goodness
intellectual
capacity
is
sometimes
found
associated
with
the
meanest
moral
character
with
abject
servility
to
those
in
high
places
and
arrogance
to
those
of
low
estate
a
man
may
be
accomplished
in
art
literature
and
science
and
yet
in
honesty
virtue
truthfulness
and
the
spirit
of
duty
be
entitled
to
take
rank
after
many
a
poor
and
illiterate
peasant
you
insist
wrote
perthes
to
a
friend
on
respect
for
learned
men
i
say
amen
but
at
the
same
time
do
forget
that
largeness
of
mind
depth
of
thought
appreciation
of
the
lofty
experience
of
the
world
delicacy
of
manner
tact
and
energy
in
action
love
of
truth
honesty
and
amiability
that
all
these
may
be
wanting
in
a
man
who
may
yet
be
very
learned
when
some
one
in
sir
walter
scott
hearing
made
a
remark
as
to
the
value
of
literary
talents
and
accomplishments
as
if
they
were
above
all
things
to
be
esteemed
and
honoured
he
observed
god
help
us
what
a
poor
world
this
would
be
if
that
were
the
true
doctrine
i
have
read
books
enough
and
observed
and
conversed
with
enough
of
eminent
and
minds
too
in
my
time
but
i
assure
you
i
have
heard
higher
sentiments
from
the
lips
of
poor
uneducated
men
and
women
when
exerting
the
spirit
of
severe
yet
gentle
heroism
under
difficulties
and
afflictions
or
speaking
their
simple
thoughts
as
to
circumstances
in
the
lot
of
friends
and
neighbours
than
i
ever
yet
met
with
out
of
the
bible
we
shall
never
learn
to
feel
and
respect
our
real
calling
and
destiny
unless
we
have
taught
ourselves
to
consider
everything
as
moonshine
compared
with
the
education
of
the
heart
still
less
has
wealth
any
necessary
connection
with
elevation
of
character
on
the
contrary
it
is
much
more
frequently
the
cause
of
its
corruption
and
degradation
wealth
and
corruption
luxury
and
vice
have
very
close
affinities
to
each
other
wealth
in
the
hands
of
men
of
weak
purpose
of
deficient
or
of
passions
is
only
a
temptation
and
a
snare
the
source
it
may
be
of
infinite
mischief
to
themselves
and
often
to
others
on
the
contrary
a
condition
of
comparative
poverty
is
compatible
with
character
in
its
highest
form
a
man
may
possess
only
his
industry
his
frugality
his
integrity
and
yet
stand
high
in
the
rank
of
true
manhood
the
advice
which
burns
father
gave
him
was
the
best
he
bade
me
act
a
manly
part
though
i
had
a
farthing
for
without
an
honest
manly
heart
no
man
was
worth
regarding
one
of
the
purest
and
noblest
characters
the
writer
ever
knew
was
a
labouring
man
in
a
northern
county
who
brought
up
his
family
respectably
on
an
income
never
amounting
to
more
than
ten
shillings
a
week
though
possessed
of
only
the
rudiments
of
common
education
obtained
at
an
ordinary
parish
school
he
was
a
man
full
of
wisdom
and
thoughtfulness
his
library
consisted
of
the
bible
and
books
which
excepting
the
first
probably
few
readers
have
ever
heard
of
this
good
man
might
have
sat
for
the
portrait
of
wordsworth
when
he
had
lived
his
modest
life
of
work
and
worship
and
finally
went
to
his
rest
he
left
behind
him
a
reputation
for
practical
wisdom
for
genuine
goodness
and
for
helpfulness
in
every
good
work
which
greater
and
richer
men
might
have
envied
when
luther
died
he
left
behind
him
as
set
forth
in
his
will
no
ready
money
no
treasure
of
coin
of
any
description
he
was
so
poor
at
one
part
of
his
life
that
he
was
under
the
necessity
of
earning
his
bread
by
turning
gardening
and
clockmaking
yet
at
the
very
time
when
he
was
thus
working
with
his
hands
he
was
moulding
the
character
of
his
country
and
he
was
morally
stronger
and
vastly
more
honoured
and
followed
than
all
the
princes
of
germany
character
is
property
it
is
the
noblest
of
possessions
it
is
an
estate
in
the
general
goodwill
and
respect
of
men
and
they
who
invest
in
it
though
they
may
not
become
rich
in
this
world
goods
will
find
their
reward
in
esteem
and
reputation
fairly
and
honourably
won
and
it
is
right
that
in
life
good
qualities
should
tell
that
industry
virtue
and
goodness
should
rank
the
highest
and
that
the
really
best
men
should
be
foremost
simple
honesty
of
purpose
in
a
man
goes
a
long
way
in
life
if
founded
on
a
just
estimate
of
himself
and
a
steady
obedience
to
the
rule
he
knows
and
feels
to
be
right
it
holds
a
man
straight
gives
him
strength
and
sustenance
and
forms
a
mainspring
of
vigorous
action
no
man
once
said
sir
benjamin
rudyard
is
bound
to
be
rich
or
great
no
nor
to
be
wise
but
every
man
is
bound
to
be
honest
but
the
purpose
besides
being
honest
must
be
inspired
by
sound
principles
and
pursued
with
undeviating
adherence
to
truth
integrity
and
uprightness
without
principles
a
man
is
like
a
ship
without
rudder
or
compass
left
to
drift
hither
and
thither
with
every
wind
that
blows
he
is
as
one
without
law
or
rule
or
order
or
government
moral
principles
says
hume
are
social
and
universal
they
form
in
a
manner
the
party
of
humankind
against
vice
and
disorder
its
common
enemy
epictetus
once
received
a
visit
from
a
certain
magnificent
orator
going
to
rome
on
a
lawsuit
who
wished
to
learn
from
the
stoic
something
of
his
philosophy
epictetus
received
his
visitor
coolly
not
believing
in
his
sincerity
you
will
only
criticise
my
style
said
he
not
really
wishing
to
learn
principles
well
but
said
the
orator
if
i
attend
to
that
sort
of
thing
i
shall
be
a
mere
pauper
like
you
with
no
plate
nor
equipage
nor
land
i
do
want
such
things
replied
epictetus
and
besides
you
are
poorer
than
i
am
after
all
patron
or
no
patron
what
care
i
you
do
care
i
am
richer
than
you
i
do
care
what
caesar
thinks
of
me
i
flatter
no
one
this
is
what
i
have
instead
of
your
gold
and
silver
plate
you
have
silver
vessels
but
earthenware
reasons
principles
appetites
my
mind
to
me
a
kingdom
is
and
it
furnishes
me
with
abundant
and
happy
occupation
in
lieu
of
your
restless
idleness
all
your
possessions
seem
small
to
you
mine
seem
great
to
me
your
desire
is
insatiate
mine
is
satisfied
talent
is
by
no
means
rare
in
the
world
nor
is
even
genius
but
can
the
talent
be
trusted
can
the
genius
not
unless
based
on
truthfulness
on
veracity
it
is
this
quality
more
than
any
other
that
commands
the
esteem
and
respect
and
secures
the
confidence
of
others
truthfulness
is
at
the
foundation
of
all
personal
excellence
it
exhibits
itself
in
conduct
it
is
rectitude
truth
in
action
and
shines
through
every
word
and
deed
it
means
reliableness
and
convinces
other
men
that
it
can
be
trusted
and
a
man
is
already
of
consequence
in
the
world
when
it
is
known
that
he
can
be
relied
on
that
when
he
says
he
knows
a
thing
he
does
know
it
that
when
he
says
he
will
do
a
thing
he
can
do
and
does
it
thus
reliableness
becomes
a
passport
to
the
general
esteem
and
confidence
of
mankind
in
the
affairs
of
life
or
of
business
it
is
not
intellect
that
tells
so
much
as
character
not
brains
so
much
as
heart
not
genius
so
much
as
patience
and
discipline
regulated
by
judgment
hence
there
is
no
better
provision
for
the
uses
of
either
private
or
public
life
than
a
fair
share
of
ordinary
good
sense
guided
by
rectitude
good
sense
disciplined
by
experience
and
inspired
by
goodness
issues
in
practical
wisdom
indeed
goodness
in
a
measure
implies
wisdom
the
highest
wisdom
the
union
of
the
worldly
with
the
spiritual
the
correspondences
of
wisdom
and
goodness
says
sir
henry
taylor
are
manifold
and
that
they
will
accompany
each
other
is
to
be
inferred
not
only
because
men
wisdom
makes
them
good
but
because
their
goodness
makes
them
wise
it
is
because
of
this
controlling
power
of
character
in
life
that
we
often
see
men
exercise
an
amount
of
influence
apparently
out
of
all
proportion
to
their
intellectual
endowments
they
appear
to
act
by
means
of
some
latent
power
some
reserved
force
which
acts
secretly
by
mere
presence
as
burke
said
of
a
powerful
nobleman
of
the
last
century
his
virtues
were
his
means
the
secret
is
that
the
aims
of
such
men
are
felt
to
be
pure
and
noble
and
they
act
upon
others
with
a
constraining
power
though
the
reputation
of
men
of
genuine
character
may
be
of
slow
growth
their
true
qualities
can
not
be
wholly
concealed
they
may
be
misrepresented
by
some
and
misunderstood
by
others
misfortune
and
adversity
may
for
a
time
overtake
them
but
with
patience
and
endurance
they
will
eventually
inspire
the
respect
and
command
the
confidence
which
they
really
deserve
it
has
been
said
of
sheridan
that
had
he
possessed
reliableness
of
character
he
might
have
ruled
the
world
whereas
for
want
of
it
his
splendid
gifts
were
comparatively
useless
he
dazzled
and
amused
but
was
without
weight
or
influence
in
life
or
politics
even
the
poor
pantomimist
of
drury
lane
felt
himself
his
superior
thus
when
delpini
one
day
pressed
the
manager
for
arrears
of
salary
sheridan
sharply
reproved
him
telling
him
he
had
forgotten
his
station
no
indeed
monsieur
sheridan
i
have
not
retorted
delpini
i
know
the
difference
between
us
perfectly
well
in
birth
parentage
and
education
you
are
superior
to
me
but
in
life
character
and
behaviour
i
am
superior
to
you
unlike
sheridan
burke
his
countryman
was
a
great
man
of
character
he
was
before
he
gained
a
seat
in
parliament
yet
he
found
time
to
carve
his
name
deep
in
the
political
history
of
england
he
was
a
man
of
great
gifts
and
of
transcendent
force
of
character
yet
he
had
a
weakness
which
proved
a
serious
defect
it
was
his
want
of
temper
his
genius
was
sacrificed
to
his
irritability
and
without
this
apparently
minor
gift
of
temper
the
most
splendid
endowments
may
be
comparatively
valueless
to
their
possessor
character
is
formed
by
a
variety
of
minute
circumstances
more
or
less
under
the
regulation
and
control
of
the
individual
not
a
day
passes
without
its
discipline
whether
for
good
or
for
evil
there
is
no
act
however
trivial
but
has
its
train
of
consequences
as
there
is
no
hair
so
small
but
casts
its
shadow
it
was
a
wise
saying
of
schimmelpenninck
mother
never
to
give
way
to
what
is
little
or
by
that
little
however
you
may
despise
it
you
will
be
practically
governed
every
action
every
thought
every
feeling
contributes
to
the
education
of
the
temper
the
habits
and
understanding
and
exercises
an
inevitable
influence
upon
all
the
acts
of
our
future
life
thus
character
is
undergoing
constant
change
for
better
or
for
worse
either
being
elevated
on
the
one
hand
or
degraded
on
the
other
there
is
no
fault
nor
folly
of
my
life
says
ruskin
that
does
not
rise
up
against
me
and
take
away
my
joy
and
shorten
my
power
of
possession
of
sight
of
understanding
and
every
past
effort
of
my
life
every
gleam
of
rightness
or
good
in
it
is
with
me
now
to
help
me
in
my
grasp
of
this
art
and
its
vision
the
mechanical
law
that
action
and
reaction
are
equal
holds
true
also
in
morals
good
deeds
act
and
react
on
the
doers
of
them
and
so
do
evil
not
only
so
they
produce
like
effects
by
the
influence
of
example
on
those
who
are
the
subjects
of
them
but
man
is
not
the
creature
so
much
as
he
is
the
creator
of
circumstances
and
by
the
exercise
of
his
freewill
he
can
direct
his
actions
so
that
they
shall
be
productive
of
good
rather
than
evil
nothing
can
work
me
damage
but
myself
said
bernard
the
harm
that
i
sustain
i
carry
about
with
me
and
i
am
never
a
real
sufferer
but
by
my
own
fault
the
best
sort
of
character
however
can
not
be
formed
without
effort
there
needs
the
exercise
of
constant
and
there
may
be
much
faltering
stumbling
and
temporary
defeat
difficulties
and
temptations
manifold
to
be
battled
with
and
overcome
but
if
the
spirit
be
strong
and
the
heart
be
upright
no
one
need
despair
of
ultimate
success
the
very
effort
to
advance
to
arrive
at
a
higher
standard
of
character
than
we
have
reached
is
inspiring
and
invigorating
and
even
though
we
may
fall
short
of
it
we
can
not
fail
to
be
improved
by
every
honest
effort
made
in
an
upward
direction
and
with
the
light
of
great
examples
to
guide
us
representatives
of
humanity
in
its
best
forms
every
one
is
not
only
justified
but
bound
in
duty
to
aim
at
reaching
the
highest
standard
of
character
not
to
become
the
richest
in
means
but
in
spirit
not
the
greatest
in
worldly
position
but
in
true
honour
not
the
most
intellectual
but
the
most
virtuous
not
the
most
powerful
and
influential
but
the
most
truthful
upright
and
honest
it
was
very
characteristic
of
the
late
prince
consort
a
man
himself
of
the
purest
mind
who
powerfully
impressed
and
influenced
others
by
the
sheer
force
of
his
own
benevolent
nature
when
drawing
up
the
conditions
of
the
annual
prize
to
be
given
by
her
majesty
at
wellington
college
to
determine
that
it
should
be
awarded
not
to
the
cleverest
boy
nor
to
the
most
bookish
boy
nor
to
the
most
precise
diligent
and
prudent
boy
but
to
the
noblest
boy
to
the
boy
who
should
show
the
most
promise
of
becoming
a
man
character
exhibits
itself
in
conduct
guided
and
inspired
by
principle
integrity
and
practical
wisdom
in
its
highest
form
it
is
the
individual
will
acting
energetically
under
the
influence
of
religion
morality
and
reason
it
chooses
its
way
considerately
and
pursues
it
steadfastly
esteeming
duty
above
reputation
and
the
approval
of
conscience
more
than
the
world
praise
while
respecting
the
personality
of
others
it
preserves
its
own
individuality
and
independence
and
has
the
courage
to
be
morally
honest
though
it
may
be
unpopular
trusting
tranquilly
to
time
and
experience
for
recognition
although
the
force
of
example
will
always
exercise
great
influence
upon
the
formation
of
character
the
and
sustaining
force
of
one
own
spirit
must
be
the
mainstay
this
alone
can
hold
up
the
life
and
give
individual
independence
and
energy
unless
man
can
erect
himself
above
himself
said
daniel
a
poet
of
the
elizabethan
era
how
poor
a
thing
is
man
without
a
certain
degree
of
practical
efficient
force
compounded
of
will
which
is
the
root
and
wisdom
which
is
the
stem
of
character
life
will
be
indefinite
and
purposeless
like
a
body
of
stagnant
water
instead
of
a
running
stream
doing
useful
work
and
keeping
the
machinery
of
a
district
in
motion
when
the
elements
of
character
are
brought
into
action
by
determinate
will
and
influenced
by
high
purpose
man
enters
upon
and
courageously
perseveres
in
the
path
of
duty
at
whatever
cost
of
worldly
interest
he
may
be
said
to
approach
the
summit
of
his
being
he
then
exhibits
character
in
its
most
intrepid
form
and
embodies
the
highest
idea
of
manliness
the
acts
of
such
a
man
become
repeated
in
the
life
and
action
of
others
his
very
words
live
and
become
actions
thus
every
word
of
luther
rang
through
germany
like
a
trumpet
as
richter
said
of
him
his
words
were
and
thus
luther
life
became
transfused
into
the
life
of
his
country
and
still
lives
in
the
character
of
modern
germany
on
the
other
hand
energy
without
integrity
and
a
soul
of
goodness
may
only
represent
the
embodied
principle
of
evil
it
is
observed
by
novalis
in
his
on
morals
that
the
ideal
of
moral
perfection
has
no
more
dangerous
rival
to
contend
with
than
the
ideal
of
the
highest
strength
and
the
most
energetic
life
the
maximum
of
the
barbarian
which
needs
only
a
due
admixture
of
pride
ambition
and
selfishness
to
be
a
perfect
ideal
of
the
devil
amongst
men
of
such
stamp
are
found
the
greatest
scourges
and
devastators
of
the
world
those
elect
scoundrels
whom
providence
in
its
inscrutable
designs
permits
to
fulfil
their
mission
of
destruction
upon
earth
very
different
is
the
man
of
energetic
character
inspired
by
a
noble
spirit
whose
actions
are
governed
by
rectitude
and
the
law
of
whose
life
is
duty
he
is
just
and
upright
in
his
business
dealings
in
his
public
action
and
in
his
family
life
justice
being
as
essential
in
the
government
of
a
home
as
of
a
nation
he
will
be
honest
in
all
things
in
his
words
and
in
his
work
he
will
be
generous
and
merciful
to
his
opponents
as
well
as
to
those
who
are
weaker
than
himself
it
was
truly
said
of
sheridan
who
with
all
his
improvidence
was
generous
and
never
gave
pain
that
his
wit
in
the
combat
as
gentle
as
bright
never
carried
a
away
on
its
blade
such
also
was
the
character
of
fox
who
commanded
the
affection
and
service
of
others
by
his
uniform
heartiness
and
sympathy
he
was
a
man
who
could
always
be
most
easily
touched
on
the
side
of
his
honour
thus
the
story
is
told
of
a
tradesman
calling
upon
him
one
day
for
the
payment
of
a
promissory
note
which
he
presented
fox
was
engaged
at
the
time
in
counting
out
gold
the
tradesman
asked
to
be
paid
from
the
money
before
him
no
said
fox
i
owe
this
money
to
sheridan
it
is
a
debt
of
honour
if
any
accident
happened
to
me
he
would
have
nothing
to
show
then
said
the
tradesman
i
change
my
debt
into
one
of
honour
and
he
tore
up
the
note
fox
was
conquered
by
the
act
he
thanked
the
man
for
his
confidence
and
paid
him
saying
then
sheridan
must
wait
yours
is
the
debt
of
older
standing
the
man
of
character
is
conscientious
he
puts
his
conscience
into
his
work
into
his
words
into
his
every
action
when
cromwell
asked
the
parliament
for
soldiers
in
lieu
of
the
decayed
and
tapsters
who
filled
the
commonwealth
army
he
required
that
they
should
be
men
who
made
some
conscience
of
what
they
did
and
such
were
the
men
of
which
his
celebrated
regiment
of
ironsides
was
composed
the
man
of
character
is
also
reverential
the
possession
of
this
quality
marks
the
noblest
and
highest
type
of
manhood
and
womanhood
reverence
for
things
consecrated
by
the
homage
of
generations
for
high
objects
pure
thoughts
and
noble
aims
for
the
great
men
of
former
times
and
the
highminded
workers
amongst
our
contemporaries
reverence
is
alike
indispensable
to
the
happiness
of
individuals
of
families
and
of
nations
without
it
there
can
be
no
trust
no
faith
no
confidence
either
in
man
or
god
neither
social
peace
nor
social
progress
for
reverence
is
but
another
word
for
religion
which
binds
men
to
each
other
and
all
to
god
the
man
of
noble
spirit
says
sir
thomas
overbury
converts
all
occurrences
into
experience
between
which
experience
and
his
reason
there
is
marriage
and
the
issue
are
his
actions
he
moves
by
affection
not
for
affection
he
loves
glory
scorns
shame
and
governeth
and
obeyeth
with
one
countenance
for
it
comes
from
one
consideration
knowing
reason
to
be
no
idle
gift
of
nature
he
is
the
steersman
of
his
own
destiny
truth
is
his
goddess
and
he
takes
pains
to
get
her
not
to
look
like
her
unto
the
society
of
men
he
is
a
sun
whose
clearness
directs
their
steps
in
a
regular
motion
he
is
the
wise
man
friend
the
example
of
the
indifferent
the
medicine
of
the
vicious
thus
time
goeth
not
from
him
but
with
him
and
he
feels
age
more
by
the
strength
of
his
soul
than
by
the
weakness
of
his
body
thus
feels
he
no
pain
but
esteems
all
such
things
as
friends
that
desire
to
file
off
his
fetters
and
help
him
out
of
prison
energy
of
will
force
is
the
soul
of
every
great
character
where
it
is
there
is
life
where
it
is
not
there
is
faintness
helplessness
and
despondency
the
strong
man
and
the
waterfall
says
the
proverb
channel
their
own
path
the
energetic
leader
of
noble
spirit
not
only
wins
a
way
for
himself
but
carries
others
with
him
his
every
act
has
a
personal
significance
indicating
vigour
independence
and
and
unconsciously
commands
respect
admiration
and
homage
such
intrepidity
of
character
characterised
luther
cromwell
washington
pitt
wellington
and
all
great
leaders
of
men
i
am
convinced
said
gladstone
in
describing
the
qualities
of
the
late
lord
palmerston
in
the
house
of
commons
shortly
after
his
death
i
am
convinced
that
it
was
the
force
of
will
a
sense
of
duty
and
a
determination
not
to
give
in
that
enabled
him
to
make
himself
a
model
for
all
of
us
who
yet
remain
and
follow
him
with
feeble
and
unequal
steps
in
the
discharge
of
our
duties
it
was
that
force
of
will
that
in
point
of
fact
did
not
so
much
struggle
against
the
infirmities
of
old
age
but
actually
repelled
them
and
kept
them
at
a
distance
and
one
other
quality
there
is
at
least
that
may
be
noticed
without
the
smallest
risk
of
stirring
in
any
breast
a
painful
emotion
it
is
this
that
lord
palmerston
had
a
nature
incapable
of
enduring
anger
or
any
sentiment
of
wrath
this
freedom
from
wrathful
sentiment
was
not
the
result
of
painful
effort
but
the
spontaneous
fruit
of
the
mind
it
was
a
noble
gift
of
his
original
nature
a
gift
which
beyond
all
others
it
was
delightful
to
observe
delightful
also
to
remember
in
connection
with
him
who
has
left
us
and
with
whom
we
have
no
longer
to
do
except
in
endeavouring
to
profit
by
his
example
wherever
it
can
lead
us
in
the
path
of
duty
and
of
right
and
of
bestowing
on
him
those
tributes
of
admiration
and
affection
which
he
deserves
at
our
hands
the
great
leader
attracts
to
himself
men
of
kindred
character
drawing
them
towards
him
as
the
loadstone
draws
iron
thus
sir
john
moore
early
distinguished
the
three
brothers
napier
from
the
crowd
of
officers
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
and
they
on
their
part
repaid
him
by
their
passionate
admiration
they
were
captivated
by
his
courtesy
his
bravery
and
his
lofty
disinterestedness
and
he
became
the
model
whom
they
resolved
to
imitate
and
if
possible
to
emulate
influence
says
the
biographer
of
sir
william
napier
had
a
signal
effect
in
forming
and
maturing
their
characters
and
it
is
no
small
glory
to
have
been
the
hero
of
those
three
men
while
his
early
discovery
of
their
mental
and
moral
qualities
is
a
proof
of
moore
own
penetration
and
judgment
of
character
there
is
a
contagiousness
in
every
example
of
energetic
conduct
the
brave
man
is
an
inspiration
to
the
weak
and
compels
them
as
it
were
to
follow
him
thus
napier
relates
that
at
the
combat
of
vera
when
the
spanish
centre
was
broken
and
in
flight
a
young
officer
named
havelock
sprang
forward
and
waving
his
hat
called
upon
the
spaniards
within
sight
to
follow
him
putting
spurs
to
his
horse
he
leapt
the
abbatis
which
protected
the
french
front
and
went
headlong
against
them
the
spaniards
were
electrified
in
a
moment
they
dashed
after
him
cheering
for
el
chico
blanco
fair
boy
and
with
one
shock
they
broke
through
the
french
and
sent
them
flying
downhill
and
so
it
is
in
ordinary
life
the
good
and
the
great
draw
others
after
them
they
lighten
and
lift
up
all
who
are
within
reach
of
their
influence
they
are
as
so
many
living
centres
of
beneficent
activity
let
a
man
of
energetic
and
upright
character
be
appointed
to
a
position
of
trust
and
authority
and
all
who
serve
under
him
become
as
it
were
conscious
of
an
increase
of
power
when
chatham
was
appointed
minister
his
personal
influence
was
at
once
felt
through
all
the
ramifications
of
office
every
sailor
who
served
under
nelson
and
knew
he
was
in
command
shared
the
inspiration
of
the
hero
when
washington
consented
to
act
as
it
was
felt
as
if
the
strength
of
the
american
forces
had
been
more
than
doubled
many
years
late
in
when
washington
grown
old
had
withdrawn
from
public
life
and
was
living
in
retirement
at
mount
vernon
and
when
it
seemed
probable
that
france
would
declare
war
against
the
united
states
president
adams
wrote
to
him
saying
we
must
have
your
name
if
you
will
permit
us
to
use
it
there
will
be
more
efficacy
in
it
than
in
many
an
army
such
was
the
esteem
in
which
the
great
president
noble
character
and
eminent
abilities
were
held
by
his
countrymen
an
incident
is
related
by
the
historian
of
the
peninsular
war
illustrative
of
the
personal
influence
exercised
by
a
great
commander
over
his
followers
the
british
army
lay
at
sauroren
before
which
soult
was
advancing
prepared
to
attack
in
force
wellington
was
absent
and
his
arrival
was
anxiously
looked
for
suddenly
a
single
horseman
was
seen
riding
up
the
mountain
alone
it
was
the
duke
about
to
join
his
troops
one
of
campbell
portuguese
battalions
first
descried
him
and
raised
a
joyful
cry
then
the
shrill
clamour
caught
up
by
the
next
regiment
soon
swelled
as
it
ran
along
the
line
into
that
appalling
shout
which
the
british
soldier
is
wont
to
give
upon
the
edge
of
battle
and
which
no
enemy
ever
heard
unmoved
suddenly
he
stopped
at
a
conspicuous
point
for
he
desired
both
armies
should
know
he
was
there
and
a
double
spy
who
was
present
pointed
out
soult
who
was
so
near
that
his
features
could
be
distinguished
attentively
wellington
fixed
his
eyes
on
that
formidable
man
and
as
if
speaking
to
himself
he
said
yonder
is
a
great
commander
but
he
is
cautious
and
will
delay
his
attack
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
those
cheers
that
will
give
time
for
the
sixth
division
to
arrive
and
i
shall
beat
him
which
he
did
in
some
cases
personal
character
acts
by
a
kind
of
talismanic
influence
as
if
certain
men
were
the
organs
of
a
sort
of
supernatural
force
if
i
but
stamp
on
the
ground
in
italy
said
pompey
an
army
will
appear
at
the
voice
of
peter
the
hermit
as
described
by
the
historian
europe
arose
and
precipitated
itself
upon
asia
it
was
said
of
the
caliph
omar
that
his
struck
more
terror
into
those
who
saw
it
than
another
man
sword
the
very
names
of
some
men
are
like
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
when
the
douglas
lay
mortally
wounded
on
the
field
of
otterburn
he
ordered
his
name
to
be
shouted
still
louder
than
before
saying
there
was
a
tradition
in
his
family
that
a
dead
douglas
should
win
a
battle
his
followers
inspired
by
the
sound
gathered
fresh
courage
rallied
and
conquered
and
thus
in
the
words
of
the
scottish
poet
the
douglas
dead
his
name
hath
won
the
field
there
have
been
some
men
whose
greatest
conquests
have
been
achieved
after
they
themselves
were
dead
never
says
michelet
was
caesar
more
alive
more
powerful
more
terrible
than
when
his
old
and
body
his
withered
corpse
lay
pierced
with
blows
he
appeared
then
purified
redeemed
that
which
he
had
been
despite
his
many
stains
the
man
of
humanity
never
did
the
great
character
of
william
of
orange
surnamed
the
silent
exercise
greater
power
over
his
countrymen
than
after
his
assassination
at
delft
by
the
emissary
of
the
jesuits
on
the
very
day
of
his
murder
the
estates
of
holland
resolved
to
maintain
the
good
cause
with
god
help
to
the
uttermost
without
sparing
gold
or
blood
and
they
kept
their
word
the
same
illustration
applies
to
all
history
and
morals
the
career
of
a
great
man
remains
an
enduring
monument
of
human
energy
the
man
dies
and
disappears
but
his
thoughts
and
acts
survive
and
leave
an
indelible
stamp
upon
his
race
and
thus
the
spirit
of
his
life
is
prolonged
and
perpetuated
moulding
the
thought
and
will
and
thereby
contributing
to
form
the
character
of
the
future
it
is
the
men
that
advance
in
the
highest
and
best
directions
who
are
the
true
beacons
of
human
progress
they
are
as
lights
set
upon
a
hill
illumining
the
moral
atmosphere
around
them
and
the
light
of
their
spirit
continues
to
shine
upon
all
succeeding
generations
it
is
natural
to
admire
and
revere
really
great
men
they
hallow
the
nation
to
which
they
belong
and
lift
up
not
only
all
who
live
in
their
time
but
those
who
live
after
them
their
great
example
becomes
the
common
heritage
of
their
race
and
their
great
deeds
and
great
thoughts
are
the
most
glorious
of
legacies
to
mankind
they
connect
the
present
with
the
past
and
help
on
the
increasing
purpose
of
the
future
holding
aloft
the
standard
of
principle
maintaining
the
dignity
of
human
character
and
filling
the
mind
with
traditions
and
instincts
of
all
that
is
most
worthy
and
noble
in
life
character
embodied
in
thought
and
deed
is
of
the
nature
of
immortality
the
solitary
thought
of
a
great
thinker
will
dwell
in
the
minds
of
men
for
centuries
until
at
length
it
works
itself
into
their
daily
life
and
practice
it
lives
on
through
the
ages
speaking
as
a
voice
from
the
dead
and
influencing
minds
living
thousands
of
years
apart
thus
moses
and
david
and
solomon
plato
and
socrates
and
xenophon
seneca
and
cicero
and
epictetus
still
speak
to
us
as
from
their
tombs
they
still
arrest
the
attention
and
exercise
an
influence
upon
character
though
their
thoughts
be
conveyed
in
languages
unspoken
by
them
and
in
their
time
unknown
theodore
parker
has
said
that
a
single
man
like
socrates
was
worth
more
to
a
country
than
many
such
states
as
south
carolina
that
if
that
state
went
out
of
the
world
she
would
not
have
done
so
much
for
the
world
as
socrates
great
workers
and
great
thinkers
are
the
true
makers
of
history
which
is
but
continuous
humanity
influenced
by
men
of
character
by
great
leaders
kings
priests
philosophers
statesmen
and
patriots
the
true
aristocracy
of
man
indeed
carlyle
has
broadly
stated
that
universal
history
is
at
bottom
but
the
history
of
great
men
they
certainly
mark
and
designate
the
epochs
of
national
life
their
influence
is
active
as
well
as
reactive
though
their
mind
is
in
a
measure
the
product
of
their
age
the
public
mind
is
also
to
a
great
extent
their
creation
their
individual
action
identifies
the
cause
the
institution
they
think
great
thoughts
cast
them
abroad
and
the
thoughts
make
events
thus
the
early
reformers
initiated
the
reformation
and
with
it
the
liberation
of
modern
thought
emerson
has
said
that
every
institution
is
to
be
regarded
as
but
the
lengthened
shadow
of
some
great
man
as
islamism
of
mahomet
puritanism
of
calvin
jesuitism
of
loyola
quakerism
of
fox
methodism
of
wesley
abolitionism
of
clarkson
great
men
stamp
their
mind
upon
their
age
and
nation
as
luther
did
upon
modern
germany
and
knox
upon
scotland
and
if
there
be
one
man
more
than
another
that
stamped
his
mind
on
modern
italy
it
was
dante
during
the
long
centuries
of
italian
degradation
his
burning
words
were
as
a
watchfire
and
a
beacon
to
all
true
men
he
was
the
herald
of
his
nation
liberty
braving
persecution
exile
and
death
for
the
love
of
it
he
was
always
the
most
national
of
the
italian
poets
the
most
loved
the
most
read
from
the
time
of
his
death
all
educated
italians
had
his
best
passages
by
heart
and
the
sentiments
they
enshrined
inspired
their
lives
and
eventually
influenced
the
history
of
their
nation
the
italians
wrote
byron
in
talk
dante
write
dante
and
think
and
dream
dante
at
this
moment
to
an
excess
which
would
be
ridiculous
but
that
he
deserves
their
admiration
a
succession
of
variously
gifted
men
in
different
ages
extending
from
alfred
to
albert
has
in
like
manner
contributed
by
their
life
and
example
to
shape
the
multiform
character
of
england
of
these
probably
the
most
influential
were
the
men
of
the
elizabethan
and
cromwellian
and
the
intermediate
periods
amongst
which
we
find
the
great
names
of
shakspeare
raleigh
burleigh
sidney
bacon
milton
herbert
hampden
pym
eliot
vane
cromwell
and
many
more
some
of
them
men
of
great
force
and
others
of
great
dignity
and
purity
of
character
the
lives
of
such
men
have
become
part
of
the
public
life
of
england
and
their
deeds
and
thoughts
are
regarded
as
among
the
most
cherished
bequeathments
from
the
past
so
washington
left
behind
him
as
one
of
the
greatest
treasures
of
his
country
the
example
of
a
stainless
life
of
a
great
honest
pure
and
noble
character
a
model
for
his
nation
to
form
themselves
by
in
all
time
to
come
and
in
the
case
of
washington
as
in
so
many
other
great
leaders
of
men
his
greatness
did
not
so
much
consist
in
his
intellect
his
skill
and
his
genius
as
in
his
honour
his
integrity
his
truthfulness
his
high
and
controlling
sense
of
duty
in
a
word
in
his
genuine
nobility
of
character
men
such
as
these
are
the
true
lifeblood
of
the
country
to
which
they
belong
they
elevate
and
uphold
it
fortify
and
ennoble
it
and
shed
a
glory
over
it
by
the
example
of
life
and
character
which
they
have
bequeathed
the
names
and
memories
of
great
men
says
an
able
writer
are
the
dowry
of
a
nation
widowhood
overthrow
desertion
even
slavery
can
not
take
away
from
her
this
sacred
inheritance
whenever
national
life
begins
to
quicken
the
dead
heroes
rise
in
the
memories
of
men
and
appear
to
the
living
to
stand
by
in
solemn
spectatorship
and
approval
no
country
can
be
lost
which
feels
herself
overlooked
by
such
glorious
witnesses
they
are
the
salt
of
the
earth
in
death
as
well
as
in
life
what
they
did
once
their
descendants
have
still
and
always
a
right
to
do
after
them
and
their
example
lives
in
their
country
a
continual
stimulant
and
encouragement
for
him
who
has
the
soul
to
adopt
it
but
it
is
not
great
men
only
that
have
to
be
taken
into
account
in
estimating
the
qualities
of
a
nation
but
the
character
that
pervades
the
great
body
of
the
people
when
washington
irving
visited
abbotsford
sir
walter
scott
introduced
him
to
many
of
his
friends
and
favourites
not
only
amongst
the
neighbouring
farmers
but
the
labouring
peasantry
i
wish
to
show
you
said
scott
some
of
our
really
excellent
plain
scotch
people
the
character
of
a
nation
is
not
to
be
learnt
from
its
fine
folks
its
fine
gentlemen
and
ladies
such
you
meet
everywhere
and
they
are
everywhere
the
same
while
statesmen
philosophers
and
divines
represent
the
thinking
power
of
society
the
men
who
found
industries
and
carve
out
new
careers
as
well
as
the
common
body
of
from
whom
the
national
strength
and
spirit
are
from
time
to
time
recruited
must
necessarily
furnish
the
vital
force
and
constitute
the
real
backbone
of
every
nation
nations
have
their
character
to
maintain
as
well
as
individuals
and
under
constitutional
governments
where
all
classes
more
or
less
participate
in
the
exercise
of
political
power
the
national
character
will
necessarily
depend
more
upon
the
moral
qualities
of
the
many
than
of
the
few
and
the
same
qualities
which
determine
the
character
of
individuals
also
determine
the
character
of
nations
unless
they
are
highminded
truthful
honest
virtuous
and
courageous
they
will
be
held
in
light
esteem
by
other
nations
and
be
without
weight
in
the
world
to
have
character
they
must
needs
also
be
reverential
disciplined
and
devoted
to
duty
the
nation
that
has
no
higher
god
than
pleasure
or
even
dollars
or
calico
must
needs
be
in
a
poor
way
it
were
better
to
revert
to
homer
gods
than
be
devoted
to
these
for
the
heathen
deities
at
least
imaged
human
virtues
and
were
something
to
look
up
to
as
for
institutions
however
good
in
themselves
they
will
avail
but
little
in
maintaining
the
standard
of
national
character
it
is
the
individual
men
and
the
spirit
which
actuates
them
that
determine
the
moral
standing
and
stability
of
nations
government
in
the
long
run
is
usually
no
better
than
the
people
governed
where
the
mass
is
sound
in
conscience
morals
and
habit
the
nation
will
be
ruled
honestly
and
nobly
but
where
they
are
corrupt
and
dishonest
in
heart
bound
neither
by
truth
nor
by
law
the
rule
of
rogues
and
wirepullers
becomes
inevitable
the
only
true
barrier
against
the
despotism
of
public
opinion
whether
it
be
of
the
many
or
of
the
few
is
enlightened
individual
freedom
and
purity
of
personal
character
without
these
there
can
be
no
vigorous
manhood
no
true
liberty
in
a
nation
political
rights
however
broadly
framed
will
not
elevate
a
people
individually
depraved
indeed
the
more
complete
a
system
of
popular
suffrage
and
the
more
perfect
its
protection
the
more
completely
will
the
real
character
of
a
people
be
reflected
as
by
a
mirror
in
their
laws
and
government
political
morality
can
never
have
any
solid
existence
on
a
basis
of
individual
immorality
even
freedom
exercised
by
a
debased
people
would
come
to
be
regarded
as
a
nuisance
and
liberty
of
the
press
but
a
vent
for
licentiousness
and
moral
abomination
nations
like
individuals
derive
support
and
strength
from
the
feeling
that
they
belong
to
an
illustrious
race
that
they
are
the
heirs
of
their
greatness
and
ought
to
be
the
perpetuators
of
their
glory
it
is
of
momentous
importance
that
a
nation
should
have
a
great
past
to
look
back
upon
it
steadies
the
life
of
the
present
elevates
and
upholds
it
and
lightens
and
lifts
it
up
by
the
memory
of
the
great
deeds
the
noble
sufferings
and
the
valorous
achievements
of
the
men
of
old
the
life
of
nations
as
of
men
is
a
great
treasury
of
experience
which
wisely
used
issues
in
social
progress
and
improvement
or
misused
issues
in
dreams
delusions
and
failure
like
men
nations
are
purified
and
strengthened
by
trials
some
of
the
most
glorious
chapters
in
their
history
are
those
containing
the
record
of
the
sufferings
by
means
of
which
their
character
has
been
developed
love
of
liberty
and
patriotic
feeling
may
have
done
much
but
trial
and
suffering
nobly
borne
more
than
all
a
great
deal
of
what
passes
by
the
name
of
patriotism
in
these
days
consists
of
the
merest
bigotry
and
exhibiting
itself
in
national
prejudice
national
conceit
amid
national
hatred
it
does
not
show
itself
in
deeds
but
in
boastings
in
howlings
gesticulations
and
shrieking
helplessly
for
help
in
flying
flags
and
singing
songs
and
in
perpetual
grinding
at
the
of
grievances
and
wrongs
to
be
infested
by
such
a
patriotism
as
this
is
perhaps
amongst
the
greatest
curses
that
can
befall
any
country
but
as
there
is
an
ignoble
so
is
there
a
noble
patriotism
the
patriotism
that
invigorates
and
elevates
a
country
by
noble
work
that
does
its
duty
truthfully
and
manfully
that
lives
an
honest
sober
and
upright
life
and
strives
to
make
the
best
use
of
the
opportunities
for
improvement
that
present
themselves
on
every
side
and
at
the
same
time
a
patriotism
that
cherishes
the
memory
and
example
of
the
great
men
of
old
who
by
their
sufferings
in
the
cause
of
religion
or
of
freedom
have
won
for
themselves
a
deathless
glory
and
for
their
nation
those
privileges
of
free
life
and
free
institutions
of
which
they
are
the
inheritors
and
possessors
nations
are
not
to
be
judged
by
their
size
any
more
than
individuals
it
is
not
growing
like
a
tree
in
bulk
doth
make
man
better
be
for
a
nation
to
be
great
it
need
not
necessarily
be
big
though
bigness
is
often
confounded
with
greatness
a
nation
may
be
very
big
in
point
of
territory
and
population
and
yet
be
devoid
of
true
greatness
the
people
of
israel
were
a
small
people
yet
what
a
great
life
they
developed
and
how
powerful
the
influence
they
have
exercised
on
the
destinies
of
mankind
greece
was
not
big
the
entire
population
of
attica
was
less
than
that
of
south
lancashire
athens
was
less
populous
than
new
york
and
yet
how
great
it
was
in
art
in
literature
in
philosophy
and
in
patriotism
but
it
was
the
fatal
weakness
of
athens
that
its
citizens
had
no
true
family
or
home
life
while
its
freemen
were
greatly
outnumbered
by
its
slaves
its
public
men
were
loose
if
not
corrupt
in
morals
its
women
even
the
most
accomplished
were
unchaste
hence
its
fall
became
inevitable
and
was
even
more
sudden
than
its
rise
in
like
manner
the
decline
and
fall
of
rome
was
attributable
to
the
general
corruption
of
its
people
and
to
their
engrossing
love
of
pleasure
and
idleness
work
in
the
later
days
of
rome
being
regarded
only
as
fit
for
slaves
its
citizens
ceased
to
pride
themselves
on
the
virtues
of
character
of
their
great
forefathers
and
the
empire
fell
because
it
did
not
deserve
to
live
and
so
the
nations
that
are
idle
and
luxurious
that
will
rather
lose
a
pound
of
blood
as
old
burton
says
in
a
single
combat
than
a
drop
of
sweat
in
any
honest
labour
must
inevitably
die
out
and
laborious
energetic
nations
take
their
place
when
louis
xiv
asked
colbert
how
it
was
that
ruling
so
great
and
populous
a
country
as
france
he
had
been
unable
to
conquer
so
small
a
country
as
holland
the
minister
replied
because
sire
the
greatness
of
a
country
does
not
depend
upon
the
extent
of
its
territory
but
on
the
character
of
its
people
it
is
because
of
the
industry
the
frugality
and
the
energy
of
the
dutch
that
your
majesty
has
found
them
so
difficult
to
overcome
it
is
also
related
of
spinola
and
richardet
the
ambassadors
sent
by
the
king
of
spain
to
negotiate
a
treaty
at
the
hague
in
that
one
day
they
saw
some
eight
or
ten
persons
land
from
a
little
boat
and
sitting
down
upon
the
grass
proceed
to
make
a
meal
of
and
beer
who
are
those
travellers
asked
the
ambassadors
of
a
peasant
these
are
worshipful
masters
the
deputies
from
the
states
was
his
reply
spinola
at
once
whispered
to
his
companion
we
must
make
peace
these
are
not
men
to
be
conquered
in
fine
stability
of
institutions
must
depend
upon
stability
of
character
any
number
of
depraved
units
can
not
form
a
great
nation
the
people
may
seem
to
be
highly
civilised
and
yet
be
ready
to
fall
to
pieces
at
first
touch
of
adversity
without
integrity
of
individual
character
they
can
have
no
real
strength
cohesion
soundness
they
may
be
rich
polite
and
artistic
and
yet
hovering
on
the
brink
of
ruin
if
living
for
themselves
only
and
with
no
end
but
pleasure
each
little
self
his
own
little
god
such
a
nation
is
doomed
and
its
decay
is
inevitable
where
national
character
ceases
to
be
upheld
a
nation
may
be
regarded
as
next

george
herbert
home
is
the
first
and
most
important
school
of
character
it
is
there
that
every
human
being
receives
his
best
moral
training
or
his
worst
for
it
is
there
that
he
imbibes
those
principles
of
conduct
which
endure
through
manhood
and
cease
only
with
life
it
is
a
common
saying
that
manners
make
the
man
and
there
is
a
second
that
mind
makes
the
man
but
truer
than
either
is
a
third
that
home
makes
the
man
for
the
includes
not
only
manners
and
mind
but
character
it
is
mainly
in
the
home
that
the
heart
is
opened
the
habits
are
formed
the
intellect
is
awakened
and
character
moulded
for
good
or
for
evil
from
that
source
be
it
pure
or
impure
issue
the
principles
and
maxims
that
govern
society
law
itself
is
but
the
reflex
of
homes
the
tiniest
bits
of
opinion
sown

for
nations
are
gathered
out
of
nurseries
and
they
who
hold
the
of
children
may
even
exercise
a
greater
power
than
those
who
wield
the
reins
of
government
it
is
in
the
order
of
nature
that
domestic
life
should
be
preparatory
to
social
and
that
the
mind
and
character
should
first
be
formed
in
the
home
there
the
individuals
who
afterwards
form
society
are
dealt
with
in
detail
and
fashioned
one
by
one
from
the
family
they
enter
life
and
advance
from
boyhood
to
citizenship
thus
the
home
may
be
regarded
as
the
most
influential
school
of
civilisation
for
after
all
civilisation
mainly
resolves
itself
into
a
question
of
individual
training
and
according
as
the
respective
members
of
society
are
well
or
in
youth
so
will
the
community
which
they
constitute
be
more
or
less
humanised
and
civilised
the
training
of
any
man
even
the
wisest
can
not
fail
to
be
powerfully
influenced
by
the
moral
surroundings
of
his
early
years
he
comes
into
the
world
helpless
and
absolutely
dependent
upon
those
about
him
for
nurture
and
culture
from
the
very
first
breath
that
he
draws
his
education
begins
when
a
mother
once
asked
a
clergyman
when
she
should
begin
the
education
of
her
child
then
four
years
old
he
replied
madam
if
you
have
not
begun
already
you
have
lost
those
four
years
from
the
first
smile
that
gleams
upon
an
infant
cheek
your
opportunity
begins
but
even
in
this
case
the
education
had
already
begun
for
the
child
learns
by
simple
imitation
without
effort
almost
through
the
pores
of
the
skin
a
figtree
looking
on
a
figtree
becometh
fruitful
says
the
arabian
proverb
and
so
it
is
with
children
their
first
great
instructor
is
example
however
apparently
trivial
the
influences
which
contribute
to
form
the
character
of
the
child
they
endure
through
life
the
child
character
is
the
nucleus
of
the
man
all
is
but
superposition
the
form
of
the
crystal
remains
the
same
thus
the
saying
of
the
poet
holds
true
in
a
large
degree
the
child
is
father
of
the
man
or
as
milton
puts
it
the
childhood
shows
the
man
as
morning
shows
the
day
those
impulses
to
conduct
which
last
the
longest
and
are
rooted
the
deepest
always
have
their
origin
near
our
birth
it
is
then
that
the
germs
of
virtues
or
vices
of
feelings
or
sentiments
are
first
implanted
which
determine
the
character
for
life
the
child
is
as
it
were
laid
at
the
gate
of
a
new
world
and
opens
his
eyes
upon
things
all
of
which
are
full
of
novelty
and
wonderment
at
first
it
is
enough
for
him
to
gaze
but
he
begins
to
see
to
observe
to
compare
to
learn
to
store
up
impressions
and
ideas
and
under
wise
guidance
the
progress
which
he
makes
is
really
wonderful
lord
brougham
has
observed
that
between
the
ages
of
eighteen
and
thirty
months
a
child
learns
more
of
the
material
world
of
his
own
powers
of
the
nature
of
other
bodies
and
even
of
his
own
mind
and
other
minds
than
he
acquires
in
all
the
rest
of
his
life
the
knowledge
which
a
child
accumulates
and
the
ideas
generated
in
his
mind
during
this
period
are
so
important
that
if
we
could
imagine
them
to
be
afterwards
obliterated
all
the
learning
of
a
senior
wrangler
at
cambridge
or
a
at
oxford
would
be
as
nothing
to
it
and
would
literally
not
enable
its
object
to
prolong
his
existence
for
a
week
it
is
in
childhood
that
the
mind
is
most
open
to
impressions
and
ready
to
be
kindled
by
the
first
spark
that
falls
into
it
ideas
are
then
caught
quickly
and
live
lastingly
thus
scott
is
said
to
have
received
his
first
bent
towards
ballad
literature
from
his
mother
and
grandmother
recitations
in
his
hearing
long
before
he
himself
had
learned
to
read
childhood
is
like
a
mirror
which
reflects
in
the
images
first
presented
to
it
the
first
thing
continues
for
ever
with
the
child
the
first
joy
the
first
sorrow
the
first
success
the
first
failure
the
first
achievement
the
first
misadventure
paint
the
foreground
of
his
life
all
this
while
too
the
training
of
the
character
is
in
progress
of
the
temper
the
will
and
the
habits
on
which
so
much
of
the
happiness
of
human
beings
in
depends
although
man
is
endowed
with
a
certain
power
of
contributing
to
his
own
development
independent
of
surrounding
circumstances
and
of
reacting
upon
the
life
around
him
the
bias
given
to
his
moral
character
in
early
life
is
of
immense
importance
place
even
the
philosopher
in
the
midst
of
daily
discomfort
immorality
and
vileness
and
he
will
insensibly
gravitate
towards
brutality
how
much
more
susceptible
is
the
impressionable
and
helpless
child
amidst
such
surroundings
it
is
not
possible
to
rear
a
kindly
nature
sensitive
to
evil
pure
in
mind
and
heart
amidst
coarseness
discomfort
and
impurity
thus
homes
which
are
the
nurseries
of
children
who
grow
up
into
men
and
women
will
be
good
or
bad
according
to
the
power
that
governs
them
where
the
spirit
of
love
and
duty
pervades
the
home
where
head
and
heart
bear
rule
wisely
there
where
the
daily
life
is
honest
and
virtuous
where
the
government
is
sensible
kind
and
loving
then
may
we
expect
from
such
a
home
an
issue
of
healthy
useful
and
happy
beings
capable
as
they
gain
the
requisite
strength
of
following
the
footsteps
of
their
parents
of
walking
uprightly
governing
themselves
wisely
and
contributing
to
the
welfare
of
those
about
them
on
the
other
hand
if
surrounded
by
ignorance
coarseness
and
selfishness
they
will
unconsciously
assume
the
same
character
and
grow
up
to
adult
years
rude
uncultivated
and
all
the
more
dangerous
to
society
if
placed
amidst
the
manifold
temptations
of
what
is
called
civilised
life
give
your
child
to
be
educated
by
a
slave
said
an
ancient
greek
and
instead
of
one
slave
you
will
then
have
two
the
child
can
not
help
imitating
what
he
sees
everything
is
to
him
a
model
of
manner
of
gesture
of
speech
of
habit
of
character
for
the
child
says
richter
the
most
important
era
of
life
is
that
of
childhood
when
he
begins
to
colour
and
mould
himself
by
companionship
with
others
every
new
educator
effects
less
than
his
predecessor
until
at
last
if
we
regard
all
life
as
an
educational
institution
a
circumnavigator
of
the
world
is
less
influenced
by
all
the
nations
he
has
seen
than
by
his
nurse
models
are
therefore
of
every
importance
in
moulding
the
nature
of
the
child
and
if
we
would
have
fine
characters
we
must
necessarily
present
before
them
fine
models
now
the
model
most
constantly
before
every
child
eye
is
the
mother
one
good
mother
said
george
herbert
is
worth
a
hundred
schoolmasters
in
the
home
she
is
loadstone
to
all
hearts
and
loadstar
to
all
eyes
imitation
of
her
is
constant
imitation
which
bacon
likens
to
a
globe
of
precepts
but
example
is
far
more
than
precept
it
is
instruction
in
action
it
is
teaching
without
words
often
exemplifying
more
than
tongue
can
teach
in
the
face
of
bad
example
the
best
of
precepts
are
of
but
little
avail
the
example
is
followed
not
the
precepts
indeed
precept
at
variance
with
practice
is
worse
than
useless
inasmuch
as
it
only
serves
to
teach
the
most
cowardly
of
vices
hypocrisy
even
children
are
judges
of
consistency
and
the
lessons
of
the
parent
who
says
one
thing
and
does
the
opposite
are
quickly
seen
through
the
teaching
of
the
friar
was
not
worth
much
who
preached
the
virtue
of
honesty
with
a
stolen
goose
in
his
sleeve
by
imitation
of
acts
the
character
becomes
slowly
and
imperceptibly
but
at
length
decidedly
formed
the
several
acts
may
seem
in
themselves
trivial
but
so
are
the
continuous
acts
of
daily
life
like
snowflakes
they
fall
unperceived
each
flake
added
to
the
pile
produces
no
sensible
change
and
yet
the
accumulation
of
snowflakes
makes
the
avalanche
so
do
repeated
acts
one
following
another
at
length
become
consolidated
in
habit
determine
the
action
of
the
human
being
for
good
or
for
evil
and
in
a
word
form
the
character
it
is
because
the
mother
far
more
than
the
father
influences
the
action
and
conduct
of
the
child
that
her
good
example
is
of
so
much
greater
importance
in
the
home
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
this
should
be
so
the
home
is
the
woman
domain
her
kingdom
where
she
exercises
entire
control
her
power
over
the
little
subjects
she
rules
there
is
absolute
they
look
up
to
her
for
everything
she
is
the
example
and
model
constantly
before
their
eyes
whom
they
unconsciously
observe
and
imitate
cowley
speaking
of
the
influence
of
early
example
and
ideas
early
implanted
in
the
mind
compares
them
to
letters
cut
in
the
bark
of
a
young
tree
which
grow
and
widen
with
age
the
impressions
then
made
howsoever
slight
they
may
seem
are
never
effaced
the
ideas
then
implanted
in
the
mind
are
like
seeds
dropped
into
the
ground
which
lie
there
and
germinate
for
a
time
afterwards
springing
up
in
acts
and
thoughts
and
habits
thus
the
mother
lives
again
in
her
children
they
unconsciously
mould
themselves
after
her
manner
her
speech
her
conduct
and
her
method
of
life
her
habits
become
theirs
and
her
character
is
visibly
repeated
in
them
this
maternal
love
is
the
visible
providence
of
our
race
its
influence
is
constant
and
universal
it
begins
with
the
education
of
the
human
being
at
the
of
life
and
is
prolonged
by
virtue
of
the
powerful
influence
which
every
good
mother
exercises
over
her
children
through
life
when
launched
into
the
world
each
to
take
part
in
its
labours
anxieties
and
trials
they
still
turn
to
their
mother
for
consolation
if
not
for
counsel
in
their
time
of
trouble
and
difficulty
the
pure
and
good
thoughts
she
has
implanted
in
their
minds
when
children
continue
to
grow
up
into
good
acts
long
after
she
is
dead
and
when
there
is
nothing
but
a
memory
of
her
left
her
children
rise
up
and
call
her
blessed
it
is
not
saying
too
much
to
aver
that
the
happiness
or
misery
the
enlightenment
or
ignorance
the
civilisation
or
barbarism
of
the
world
depends
in
a
very
high
degree
upon
the
exercise
of
woman
power
within
her
special
kingdom
of
home
indeed
emerson
says
broadly
and
truly
that
a
sufficient
measure
of
civilisation
is
the
influence
of
good
women
posterity
may
be
said
to
lie
before
us
in
the
person
of
the
child
in
the
mother
lap
what
that
child
will
eventually
become
mainly
depends
upon
the
training
and
example
which
he
has
received
from
his
first
and
most
influential
educator
woman
above
all
other
educators
educates
humanly
man
is
the
brain
but
woman
is
the
heart
of
humanity
he
its
judgment
she
its
feeling
he
its
strength
she
its
grace
ornament
and
solace
even
the
understanding
of
the
best
woman
seems
to
work
mainly
through
her
affections
and
thus
though
man
may
direct
the
intellect
woman
cultivates
the
feelings
which
mainly
determine
the
character
while
he
fills
the
memory
she
occupies
the
heart
she
makes
us
love
what
he
can
only
make
us
believe
and
it
is
chiefly
through
her
that
we
are
enabled
to
arrive
at
virtue
the
respective
influences
of
the
father
and
the
mother
on
the
training
and
development
of
character
are
remarkably
illustrated
in
the
life
of
augustine
while
augustine
father
a
poor
freeman
of
thagaste
proud
of
his
son
abilities
endeavoured
to
furnish
his
mind
with
the
highest
learning
of
the
schools
and
was
extolled
by
his
neighbours
for
the
sacrifices
he
made
with
that
object
beyond
the
ability
of
his
means
his
mother
monica
on
the
other
hand
sought
to
lead
her
son
mind
in
the
direction
of
the
highest
good
and
with
pious
care
counselled
him
entreated
him
advised
him
to
chastity
and
amidst
much
anguish
and
tribulation
because
of
his
wicked
life
never
ceased
to
pray
for
him
until
her
prayers
were
heard
and
answered
thus
her
love
at
last
triumphed
and
the
patience
and
goodness
of
the
mother
were
rewarded
not
only
by
the
conversion
of
her
gifted
son
but
also
of
her
husband
later
in
life
and
after
her
husband
death
monica
drawn
by
her
affection
followed
her
son
to
milan
to
watch
over
him
and
there
she
died
when
he
was
in
his
year
but
it
was
in
the
earlier
period
of
his
life
that
her
example
and
instruction
made
the
deepest
impression
upon
his
mind
and
determined
his
future
character
there
are
many
similar
instances
of
early
impressions
made
upon
a
child
mind
springing
up
into
good
acts
late
in
life
after
an
intervening
period
of
selfishness
and
vice
parents
may
do
all
that
they
can
to
develope
an
upright
and
virtuous
character
in
their
children
and
apparently
in
vain
it
seems
like
bread
cast
upon
the
waters
and
lost
and
yet
sometimes
it
happens
that
long
after
the
parents
have
gone
to
their
rest
it
may
be
twenty
years
or
more
the
good
precept
the
good
example
set
before
their
sons
and
daughters
in
childhood
at
length
springs
up
and
bears
fruit
one
of
the
most
remarkable
of
such
instances
was
that
of
the
reverend
john
newton
of
olney
the
friend
of
cowper
the
poet
it
was
long
subsequent
to
the
death
of
both
his
parents
and
after
leading
a
vicious
life
as
a
youth
and
as
a
seaman
that
he
became
suddenly
awakened
to
a
sense
of
his
depravity
and
then
it
was
that
the
lessons
which
his
mother
had
given
him
when
a
child
sprang
up
vividly
in
his
memory
her
voice
came
to
him
as
it
were
from
the
dead
and
led
him
gently
back
to
virtue
and
goodness
another
instance
is
that
of
john
randolph
the
american
statesman
who
once
said
i
should
have
been
an
atheist
if
it
had
not
been
for
one
recollection
and
that
was
the
memory
of
the
time
when
my
departed
mother
used
to
take
my
little
hand
in
hers
and
cause
me
on
my
knees
to
say
father
who
art
in
heaven
but
such
instance
must
on
the
whole
be
regarded
as
exceptional
as
the
character
is
biassed
in
early
life
so
it
generally
remains
gradually
assuming
its
permanent
form
as
manhood
is
reached
live
as
long
as
you
may
said
southey
the
first
twenty
years
are
the
longest
half
of
your
life
and
they
are
by
far
the
most
pregnant
in
consequences
when
the
slanderer
and
voluptuary
wolcot
lay
on
his
deathbed
one
of
his
friends
asked
if
he
could
do
anything
to
gratify
him
yes
said
the
dying
man
eagerly
give
me
back
my
youth
give
him
but
that
and
he
would
repent
he
would
reform
but
it
was
all
too
late
his
life
had
become
bound
and
enthralled
by
the
chains
of
habit
gretry
the
musical
composer
thought
so
highly
of
the
importance
of
woman
as
an
educator
of
character
that
he
described
a
good
mother
as
nature
and
he
was
right
for
good
mothers
far
more
than
fathers
tend
to
the
perpetual
renovation
of
mankind
creating
as
they
do
the
moral
atmosphere
of
the
home
which
is
the
nutriment
of
man
moral
being
as
the
physical
atmosphere
is
of
his
corporeal
frame
by
good
temper
suavity
and
kindness
directed
by
intelligence
woman
surrounds
the
indwellers
with
a
pervading
atmosphere
of
cheerfulness
contentment
and
peace
suitable
for
the
growth
of
the
purest
as
of
the
manliest
natures
the
poorest
dwelling
presided
over
by
a
virtuous
thrifty
cheerful
and
cleanly
woman
may
thus
be
the
abode
of
comfort
virtue
and
happiness
it
may
be
the
scene
of
every
ennobling
relation
in
family
life
it
may
be
endeared
to
a
man
by
many
delightful
associations
furnishing
a
sanctuary
for
the
heart
a
refuge
from
the
storms
of
life
a
sweet
after
labour
a
consolation
in
misfortune
a
pride
in
prosperity
and
a
joy
at
all
times
the
good
home
is
thus
the
best
of
schools
not
only
in
youth
but
in
age
there
young
and
old
best
learn
cheerfulness
patience
and
the
spirit
of
service
and
of
duty
izaak
walton
speaking
of
george
herbert
mother
says
she
governed
her
family
with
judicious
care
not
rigidly
nor
sourly
but
with
such
a
sweetness
and
compliance
with
the
recreations
and
pleasures
of
youth
as
did
incline
them
to
spend
much
of
their
time
in
her
company
which
was
to
her
great
content
the
home
is
the
true
school
of
courtesy
of
which
woman
is
always
the
best
practical
instructor
without
woman
says
the
provencal
proverb
men
were
but
cubs
philanthropy
radiates
from
the
home
as
from
a
centre
to
love
the
little
platoon
we
belong
to
in
society
said
burke
is
the
germ
of
all
public
affections
the
wisest
and
the
best
have
not
been
ashamed
to
own
it
to
be
their
greatest
joy
and
happiness
to
sit
behind
the
heads
of
children
in
the
inviolable
circle
of
home
a
life
of
purity
and
duty
there
is
not
the
least
effectual
preparative
for
a
life
of
public
work
and
duty
and
the
man
who
loves
his
home
will
not
the
less
fondly
love
and
serve
his
country
but
while
homes
which
are
the
nurseries
of
character
may
be
the
best
of
schools
they
may
also
be
the
worst
between
childhood
and
manhood
how
incalculable
is
the
mischief
which
ignorance
in
the
home
has
the
power
to
cause
between
the
drawing
of
the
first
breath
and
the
last
how
vast
is
the
moral
suffering
and
disease
occasioned
by
incompetent
mothers
and
nurses
commit
a
child
to
the
care
of
a
worthless
ignorant
woman
and
no
culture
in
will
remedy
the
evil
you
have
done
let
the
mother
be
idle
vicious
and
a
slattern
let
her
home
be
pervaded
by
cavilling
petulance
and
discontent
and
it
will
become
a
dwelling
of
misery
a
place
to
fly
from
rather
than
to
fly
to
and
the
children
whose
misfortune
it
is
to
be
brought
up
there
will
be
morally
dwarfed
and
deformed
the
cause
of
misery
to
themselves
as
well
as
to
others
napoleon
buonaparte
was
accustomed
to
say
that
the
future
good
or
bad
conduct
of
a
child
depended
entirely
on
the
mother
he
himself
attributed
his
rise
in
life
in
a
great
measure
to
the
training
of
his
will
his
energy
and
his
by
his
mother
at
home
nobody
had
any
command
over
him
says
one
of
his
biographers
except
his
mother
who
found
means
by
a
mixture
of
tenderness
severity
and
justice
to
make
him
love
respect
and
obey
her
from
her
he
learnt
the
virtue
of
obedience
a
curious
illustration
of
the
dependence
of
the
character
of
children
on
that
of
the
mother
incidentally
occurs
in
one
of
tufnell
school
reports
the
truth
he
observes
is
so
well
established
that
it
has
even
been
made
subservient
to
mercantile
calculation
i
was
informed
he
says
in
a
large
factory
where
many
children
were
employed
that
the
managers
before
they
engaged
a
boy
always
inquired
into
the
character
and
if
that
was
satisfactory
they
were
tolerably
certain
that
her
children
would
conduct
themselves
creditably
no
attention
was
paid
to
the
character
of
the
father
it
has
also
been
observed
that
in
cases
where
the
father
has
turned
out
badly
become
a
drunkard
and
gone
to
the
dogs
provided
the
mother
is
prudent
and
sensible
the
family
will
be
kept
together
and
the
children
probably
make
their
way
honourably
in
life
whereas
in
cases
of
the
opposite
sort
where
the
mother
turns
out
badly
no
matter
how
the
father
may
be
the
instances
of
in
life
on
the
part
of
the
children
are
comparatively
rare
the
greater
part
of
the
influence
exercised
by
women
on
the
formation
of
character
necessarily
remains
unknown
they
accomplish
their
best
work
in
the
quiet
seclusion
of
the
home
and
the
family
by
sustained
effort
and
patient
perseverance
in
the
path
of
duty
their
greatest
triumphs
because
private
and
domestic
are
rarely
recorded
and
it
is
not
often
even
in
the
biographies
of
distinguished
men
that
we
hear
of
the
share
which
their
mothers
have
had
in
the
formation
of
their
character
and
in
giving
them
a
bias
towards
goodness
yet
are
they
not
on
that
account
without
their
reward
the
influence
they
have
exercised
though
unrecorded
lives
after
them
and
goes
on
propagating
itself
in
consequences
for
ever
we
do
not
often
hear
of
great
women
as
we
do
of
great
men
it
is
of
good
women
that
we
mostly
hear
and
it
is
probable
that
by
determining
the
character
of
men
and
women
for
good
they
are
doing
even
greater
work
than
if
they
were
to
paint
great
pictures
write
great
books
or
compose
great
operas
it
is
quite
true
said
joseph
de
maistre
that
women
have
produced
no
they
have
written
no
nor
delivered
nor
nor
nor
lost
nor
they
have
designed
no
church
of
peter
composed
no
carved
no
belvidere
painted
no
judgment
they
have
invented
neither
algebra
nor
telescopes
nor
but
they
have
done
something
far
greater
and
better
than
all
this
for
it
is
at
their
knees
that
upright
and
virtuous
men
and
women
have
been
trained
the
most
excellent
productions
in
the
world
de
maistre
in
his
letters
and
writings
speaks
of
his
own
mother
with
immense
love
and
reverence
her
noble
character
made
all
other
women
venerable
in
his
eyes
he
described
her
as
his
sublime
mother
an
angel
to
whom
god
had
lent
a
body
for
a
brief
season
to
her
he
attributed
the
bent
of
his
character
and
all
his
bias
towards
good
and
when
he
had
grown
to
mature
years
while
acting
as
ambassador
at
the
court
of
petersburg
he
referred
to
her
noble
example
and
precepts
as
the
ruling
influence
in
his
life
one
of
the
most
charming
features
in
the
character
of
samuel
johnson
notwithstanding
his
rough
and
shaggy
exterior
was
the
tenderness
with
which
he
invariably
spoke
of
his
mother
a
woman
of
strong
understanding
who
firmly
implanted
in
his
mind
as
he
himself
acknowledges
his
first
impressions
of
religion
he
was
accustomed
even
in
the
time
of
his
greatest
difficulties
to
contribute
largely
out
of
his
slender
means
to
her
comfort
and
one
of
his
last
acts
of
filial
duty
was
to
write
for
the
purpose
of
paying
her
little
debts
and
defraying
her
funeral
charges
george
washington
was
only
eleven
years
of
age
the
eldest
of
five
children
when
his
father
died
leaving
his
mother
a
widow
she
was
a
woman
of
rare
excellence
full
of
resources
a
good
woman
of
business
an
excellent
manager
and
possessed
of
much
strength
of
character
she
had
her
children
to
educate
and
bring
up
a
large
household
to
govern
and
extensive
estates
to
manage
all
of
which
she
accomplished
with
complete
success
her
good
sense
assiduity
tenderness
industry
and
vigilance
enabled
her
to
overcome
every
obstacle
and
as
the
richest
reward
of
her
solicitude
and
toil
she
had
the
happiness
to
see
all
her
children
come
forward
with
a
fair
promise
into
life
filling
the
spheres
allotted
to
them
in
a
manner
equally
honourable
to
themselves
and
to
the
parent
who
had
been
the
only
guide
of
their
principles
conduct
and
habits
the
biographer
of
cromwell
says
little
about
the
protector
father
but
dwells
upon
the
character
of
his
mother
whom
he
describes
as
a
woman
of
rare
vigour
and
decision
of
purpose
a
woman
he
says
possessed
of
the
glorious
faculty
of
when
other
assistance
failed
her
ready
for
the
demands
of
fortune
in
its
extremest
adverse
turn
of
spirit
and
energy
equal
to
her
mildness
and
patience
who
with
the
labour
of
her
own
hands
gave
dowries
to
five
daughters
sufficient
to
marry
them
into
families
as
honourable
but
more
wealthy
than
their
own
whose
single
pride
was
honesty
and
whose
passion
was
love
who
preserved
in
the
gorgeous
palace
at
whitehall
the
simple
tastes
that
distinguished
her
in
the
old
brewery
at
huntingdon
and
whose
only
care
amidst
all
her
splendour
was
for
the
safety
of
her
son
in
his
dangerous
eminence
we
have
spoken
of
the
mother
of
napoleon
buonaparte
as
a
woman
of
great
force
of
character
not
less
so
was
the
mother
of
the
duke
of
wellington
whom
her
son
strikingly
resembled
in
features
person
and
character
while
his
father
was
principally
distinguished
as
a
musical
composer
and
performer
but
strange
to
say
wellington
mother
mistook
him
for
a
dunce
and
for
some
reason
or
other
he
was
not
such
a
favourite
as
her
other
children
until
his
great
deeds
in
constrained
her
to
be
proud
of
him
the
napiers
were
blessed
in
both
parents
but
especially
in
their
mother
lady
sarah
lennox
who
early
sought
to
inspire
her
sons
minds
with
elevating
thoughts
admiration
of
noble
deeds
and
a
chivalrous
spirit
which
became
embodied
in
their
lives
and
continued
to
sustain
them
until
death
in
the
path
of
duty
and
of
honour
among
statesmen
lawyers
and
divines
we
find
marked
mention
made
of
the
mothers
of
lord
chancellors
bacon
erskine
and
brougham
all
women
of
great
ability
and
in
the
case
of
the
first
of
great
learning
as
well
as
of
the
mothers
of
canning
curran
and
president
adams
of
herbert
paley
and
wesley
lord
brougham
speaks
in
terms
almost
approaching
reverence
of
his
grandmother
the
sister
of
professor
robertson
as
having
been
mainly
instrumental
in
instilling
into
his
mind
a
strong
desire
for
information
and
the
first
principles
of
that
persevering
energy
in
the
pursuit
of
every
kind
of
knowledge
which
formed
his
prominent
characteristic
throughout
life
canning
mother
was
an
irishwoman
of
great
natural
ability
for
whom
her
gifted
son
entertained
the
greatest
love
and
respect
to
the
close
of
his
career
she
was
a
woman
of
no
ordinary
intellectual
power
indeed
says
canning
biographer
were
we
not
otherwise
assured
of
the
fact
from
direct
sources
it
would
be
impossible
to
contemplate
his
profound
and
touching
devotion
to
her
without
being
led
to
conclude
that
the
object
of
such
unchanging
attachment
must
have
been
possessed
of
rare
and
commanding
qualities
she
was
esteemed
by
the
circle
in
which
she
lived
as
a
woman
of
great
mental
energy
her
conversation
was
animated
and
vigorous
and
marked
by
a
distinct
originality
of
manner
and
a
choice
of
topics
fresh
and
striking
and
out
of
the
commonplace
routine
to
persons
who
were
but
slightly
acquainted
with
her
the
energy
of
her
manner
had
even
something
of
the
air
of
eccentricity
curran
speaks
with
great
affection
of
his
mother
as
a
woman
of
strong
original
understanding
to
whose
wise
counsel
consistent
piety
and
lessons
of
honourable
ambition
which
she
diligently
enforced
on
the
minds
of
her
children
he
himself
principally
attributed
his
success
in
life
the
only
inheritance
he
used
to
say
that
i
could
boast
of
from
my
poor
father
was
the
very
scanty
one
of
an
unattractive
face
and
person
like
his
own
and
if
the
world
has
ever
attributed
to
me
something
more
valuable
than
face
or
person
or
than
earthly
wealth
it
was
that
another
and
a
dearer
parent
gave
her
child
a
portion
from
the
treasure
of
her
mind
when
adams
was
present
at
the
examination
of
a
school
at
boston
he
was
presented
by
the
pupils
with
an
address
which
deeply
affected
him
and
in
acknowledging
it
he
took
the
opportunity
of
referring
to
the
lasting
influence
which
womanly
training
and
association
had
exercised
upon
his
own
life
and
character
as
a
child
he
said
i
enjoyed
perhaps
the
greatest
of
blessings
that
can
be
bestowed
on
man
that
of
a
mother
who
was
anxious
and
capable
to
form
the
characters
of
her
children
rightly
from
her
i
derived
whatever
instruction
especially
and
moral
has
pervaded
a
long
life
i
will
not
say
perfectly
or
as
it
ought
to
be
but
i
will
say
because
it
is
only
justice
to
the
memory
of
her
i
revere
that
in
the
course
of
that
life
whatever
imperfection
there
has
been
or
deviation
from
what
she
taught
me
the
fault
is
mine
and
not
hers
the
wesleys
were
peculiarly
linked
to
their
parents
by
natural
piety
though
the
mother
rather
than
the
father
influenced
their
minds
and
developed
their
characters
the
father
was
a
man
of
strong
will
but
occasionally
harsh
and
tyrannical
in
his
dealings
with
his
family
while
the
mother
with
much
strength
of
understanding
and
ardent
love
of
truth
was
gentle
persuasive
affectionate
and
simple
she
was
the
teacher
and
cheerful
companion
of
her
children
who
gradually
became
moulded
by
her
example
it
was
through
the
bias
given
by
her
to
her
sons
minds
in
religious
matters
that
they
acquired
the
tendency
which
even
in
early
years
drew
to
them
the
name
of
methodists
in
a
letter
to
her
son
samuel
wesley
when
a
scholar
at
westminster
in
she
said
i
would
advise
you
as
much
as
possible
to
throw
your
business
into
a
certain
method
by
which
means
you
will
learn
to
improve
every
precious
moment
and
find
an
unspeakable
facility
in
the
performance
of
your
respective
duties
this
method
she
went
on
to
describe
exhorting
her
son
in
all
things
to
act
upon
principle
and
the
society
which
the
brothers
john
and
charles
afterwards
founded
at
oxford
is
supposed
to
have
been
in
a
great
measure
the
result
of
her
exhortations
in
the
case
of
poets
literary
men
and
artists
the
influence
of
the
mother
feeling
and
taste
has
doubtless
had
great
effect
in
directing
the
genius
of
their
sons
and
we
find
this
especially
illustrated
in
the
lives
of
gray
thomson
scott
southey
bulwer
schiller
and
goethe
gray
inherited
almost
complete
his
kind
and

a

man

and
wanting

thoroughly

and

the

maintained

her

at

on

describing
her
as
the
careful
tender

of
many
children
one
of
whom
alone
had
the
misfortune
to
survive

the

was
at
his
own
desire
interred
beside
her
worshipped
grave
goethe
like
schiller
owed
the
bias
of
his
mind
and
character
to
his
mother
who
was
a
woman
of
extraordinary
gifts
she
was
full
of
joyous
flowing
and
possessed
in
a
high
degree
the
art
of
stimulating
young
and
active
minds
instructing
them
in
the
science
of
life
out
of
the
treasures
of
her
abundant
experience
after
a
lengthened
interview
with
her
an
enthusiastic
traveller
said
now
do
i
understand
how
goethe
has
become
the
man
he
is
goethe
himself
affectionately
cherished
her
memory
she
was
worthy
of
life
he
once
said
of
her
and
when
he
visited
frankfort
he
sought
out
every
individual
who
had
been
kind
to
his
mother
and
thanked
them
all
it
was
ary
scheffer
mother
whose
beautiful
features
the
painter
so
loved
to
reproduce
in
his
pictures
of
beatrice
monica
and
others
of
his
works
that
encouraged
his
study
of
art
and
by
great
provided
him
with
the
means
of
pursuing
it
while
living
at
dordrecht
in
holland
she
first
sent
him
to
lille
to
study
and
afterwards
to
paris
and
her
letters
to
him
while
absent
were
always
full
of
sound
motherly
advice
and
affectionate
womanly
sympathy
if
you
could
but
see
me
she
wrote
on
one
occasion
kissing
your
picture
then
after
a
while
taking
it
up
again
and
with
a
tear
in
my
eye
calling
you
beloved
son
you
would
comprehend
what
it
costs
me
to
use
sometimes
the
stern
language
of
authority
and
to
occasion
to
you
moments
of
pain
work
diligently
be
above
all
modest
and
humble
and
when
you
find
yourself
excelling
others
then
compare
what
you
have
done
with
nature
itself
or
with
the
of
your
own
mind
and
you
will
be
secured
by
the
contrast
which
will
be
apparent
against
the
effects
of
pride
and
presumption
long
years
after
when
ary
scheffer
was
himself
a
grandfather
he
remembered
with
affection
the
advice
of
his
mother
and
repeated
it
to
his
children
and
thus
the
vital
power
of
good
example
lives
on
from
generation
to
generation
keeping
the
world
ever
fresh
and
young
writing
to
his
daughter
madame
marjolin
in
his
departed
advice
recurred
to
him
and
he
said
the
word
must
fix
it
well
in
your
memory
dear
child
your
grandmother
seldom
had
it
out
of
hers
the
truth
is
that
through
our
lives
nothing
brings
any
good
fruit
except
what
is
earned
by
either
the
work
of
the
hands
or
by
the
exertion
of
one
sacrifices
must
in
short
be
ever
going
on
if
we
would
obtain
any
comfort
or
happiness
now
that
i
am
no
longer
young
i
declare
that
few
passages
in
my
life
afford
me
so
much
satisfaction
as
those
in
which
i
made
sacrifices
or
denied
myself
enjoyments
entsagen
forbidden
is
the
motto
of
the
wise
man
is
the
quality
of
which
jesus
christ
set
us
the
example
the
french
historian
michelet
makes
the
following
touching
reference
to
his
mother
in
the
preface
to
one
of
his
most
popular
books
the
subject
of
much
embittered
controversy
at
the
time
at
which
it
appeared
whilst
writing
all
this
i
have
had
in
my
mind
a
woman
whose
strong
and
serious
mind
would
not
have
failed
to
support
me
in
these
contentions
i
lost
her
thirty
years
ago
was
a
child
then
nevertheless
ever
living
in
my
memory
she
follows
me
from
age
to
age
she
suffered
with
me
in
my
poverty
and
was
not
allowed
to
share
my
better
fortune
when
young
i
made
her
sad
and
now
i
can
not
console
her
i
know
not
even
where
her
bones
are
i
was
too
poor
then
to
buy
earth
to
bury
her
and
yet
i
owe
her
much
i
feel
deeply
that
i
am
the
son
of
woman
every
instant
in
my
ideas
and
words
to
mention
my
features
and
gestures
i
find
again
my
mother
in
myself
it
is
my
mother
blood
which
gives
me
the
sympathy
i
feel
for
bygone
ages
and
the
tender
remembrance
of
all
those
who
are
now
no
more
what
return
then
could
i
who
am
myself
advancing
towards
old
age
make
her
for
the
many
things
i
owe
her
one
for
which
she
would
have
thanked
me
this
protest
in
favour
of
women
and
mothers
but
while
a
mother
may
greatly
influence
the
poetic
or
artistic
mind
of
her
son
for
good
she
may
also
influence
it
for
evil
thus
the
characteristics
of
lord
byron
the
waywardness
of
his
impulses
his
defiance
of
restraint
the
bitterness
of
his
hate
and
the
precipitancy
of
his
resentments
were
traceable
in
no
small
degree
to
the
adverse
influences
exercised
upon
his
mind
from
his
birth
by
his
capricious
violent
and
headstrong
mother
she
even
taunted
her
son
with
his
personal
deformity
and
it
was
no
unfrequent
occurrence
in
the
violent
quarrels
which
occurred
between
them
for
her
to
take
up
the
poker
or
tongs
and
hurl
them
after
him
as
he
fled
from
her
presence
it
was
this
unnatural
treatment
that
gave
a
morbid
turn
to
byron
and
careworn
unhappy
great
and
yet
weak
as
he
was
he
carried
about
with
him
the
mother
poison
which
he
had
sucked
in
his
infancy
hence
he
exclaims
in
his
harold
yet
must
i
think
less
wildly
i
have
thought
too
long
and
darkly
till
my
brain
became
in
its
own
eddy
boiling
and
a
whirling
gulf
of
phantasy
and
flame
and
thus
untaught
in
youth
my
heart
to
tame
my
springs
of
life
were
poisoned
in
like
manner
though
in
a
different
way
the
character
of
foote
the
actor
mother
was
curiously
repeated
in
the
life
of
her
joyous
son
though
she
had
been
heiress
to
a
large
fortune
she
soon
spent
it
all
and
was
at
length
imprisoned
for
debt
in
this
condition
she
wrote
to
sam
who
had
been
allowing
her
a
hundred
a
year
out
of
the
proceeds
of
his
acting
dear
sam
i
am
in
prison
for
debt
come
and
assist
your
loving
mother
e
foote
to
which
her
son
characteristically
replied
dear
mother
so
am
i
which
prevents
his
duty
being
paid
to
his
loving
mother
by
her
affectionate
son
sam
foote
a
foolish
mother
may
also
spoil
a
gifted
son
by
imbuing
his
mind
with
unsound
sentiments
thus
lamartine
mother
is
said
to
have
trained
him
in
altogether
erroneous
ideas
of
life
in
the
school
of
rousseau
and
bernardin
de
by
which
his
sentimentalism
sufficiently
strong
by
nature
was
exaggerated
instead
of
repressed
and
he
became
the
victim
of
tears
affectation
and
improvidence
all
his
life
long
it
almost
savours
of
the
ridiculous
to
find
lamartine
in
his
representing
himself
as
a
statue
of
adolescence
raised
as
a
model
for
young
men
as
he
was
his
mother
spoilt
child
so
he
was
the
spoilt
child
of
his
country
to
the
end
which
was
bitter
and
sad
says
of
him
he
was
the
continual
object
of
the
richest
gifts
which
he
had
not
the
power
of
managing
scattering
and
wasting
them
all
excepting
the
gift
of
words
which
seemed
inexhaustible
and
on
which
he
continued
to
play
to
the
end
as
on
an
enchanted
flute
we
have
spoken
of
the
mother
of
washington
as
an
excellent
woman
of
business
and
to
possess
such
a
quality
as
capacity
for
business
is
not
only
compatible
with
true
womanliness
but
is
in
a
measure
essential
to
the
comfort
and
wellbeing
of
every
family
habits
of
business
do
not
relate
to
trade
merely
but
apply
to
all
the
practical
affairs
of
life
to
everything
that
has
to
be
arranged
to
be
organised
to
be
provided
for
to
be
done
and
in
all
these
respects
the
management
of
a
family
and
of
a
household
is
as
much
a
matter
of
business
as
the
management
of
a
shop
or
of
a
it
requires
method
accuracy
organization
industry
economy
discipline
tact
knowledge
and
capacity
for
adapting
means
to
ends
all
this
is
of
the
essence
of
business
and
hence
business
habits
are
as
necessary
to
be
cultivated
by
women
who
would
succeed
in
the
affairs
of
home
in
other
words
who
would
make
home
happy
as
by
men
in
the
affairs
of
trade
of
commerce
or
of
manufacture
the
idea
has
however
heretofore
prevailed
that
women
have
no
concern
with
such
matters
and
that
business
habits
and
qualifications
relate
to
men
only
take
for
instance
the
knowledge
of
figures
mr
bright
has
said
of
boys
teach
a
boy
arithmetic
thoroughly
and
he
is
a
made
man
and
why
because
it
teaches
him
method
accuracy
value
proportions
relations
but
how
many
girls
are
taught
arithmetic
well
very
few
indeed
and
what
is
the
consequence
when
the
girl
becomes
a
wife
if
she
knows
nothing
of
figures
and
is
innocent
of
addition
and
multiplication
she
can
keep
no
record
of
income
and
expenditure
and
there
will
probably
be
a
succession
of
mistakes
committed
which
may
be
prolific
in
domestic
contention
the
woman
not
being
up
to
her
business
that
is
the
management
of
her
domestic
affairs
in
conformity
with
the
simple
principles
of
arithmetic
will
through
sheer
ignorance
be
apt
to
commit
extravagances
though
unintentional
which
may
be
most
injurious
to
her
family
peace
and
comfort
method
which
is
the
soul
of
business
is
also
of
essential
importance
in
the
home
work
can
only
be
got
through
by
method
muddle
flies
before
it
and
becomes
a
thing
unknown
method
demands
punctuality
another
eminently
business
quality
the
unpunctual
woman
like
the
unpunctual
man
occasions
dislike
because
she
consumes
and
wastes
time
and
provokes
the
reflection
that
we
are
not
of
sufficient
importance
to
make
her
more
prompt
to
the
business
man
time
is
money
but
to
the
business
woman
method
is
more
it
is
peace
comfort
and
domestic
prosperity
prudence
is
another
important
business
quality
in
women
as
in
men
prudence
is
practical
wisdom
and
comes
of
the
cultivated
judgment
it
has
reference
in
all
things
to
fitness
to
propriety
judging
wisely
of
the
right
thing
to
be
done
and
the
right
way
of
doing
it
it
calculates
the
means
order
time
and
method
of
doing
prudence
learns
from
experience
quickened
by
knowledge
for
these
amongst
other
reasons
habits
of
business
are
necessary
to
be
cultivated
by
all
women
in
order
to
their
being
efficient
helpers
in
the
world
daily
life
and
work
furthermore
to
direct
the
power
of
the
home
aright
women
as
the
nurses
trainers
and
educators
of
children
need
all
the
help
and
strength
that
mental
culture
can
give
them
mere
instinctive
love
is
not
sufficient
instinct
which
preserves
the
lower
creatures
needs
no
training
but
human
intelligence
which
is
in
constant
request
in
a
family
needs
to
be
educated
the
physical
health
of
the
rising
generation
is
entrusted
to
woman
by
providence
and
it
is
in
the
physical
nature
that
the
moral
and
mental
nature
lies
enshrined
it
is
only
by
acting
in
accordance
with
the
natural
laws
which
before
she
can
follow
woman
must
needs
understand
that
the
blessings
of
health
of
body
and
health
of
mind
and
morals
can
be
secured
at
home
without
a
knowledge
of
such
laws
the
mother
love
too
often
finds
its
recompence
only
in
a
child
coffin
it
is
a
mere
truism
to
say
that
the
intellect
with
which
woman
as
well
as
man
is
endowed
has
been
given
for
use
and
exercise
and
not
to
fust
in
her
unused
such
endowments
are
never
conferred
without
a
purpose
the
creator
may
be
lavish
in
his
gifts
but
he
is
never
wasteful
woman
was
not
meant
to
be
either
an
unthinking
drudge
or
the
merely
pretty
ornament
of
man
leisure
she
exists
for
herself
as
well
as
for
others
and
the
serious
and
responsible
duties
she
is
called
upon
to
perform
in
life
require
the
cultivated
head
as
well
as
the
sympathising
heart
her
highest
mission
is
not
to
be
fulfilled
by
the
mastery
of
fleeting
accomplishments
on
which
so
much
useful
time
is
now
wasted
for
though
accomplishments
may
enhance
the
charms
of
youth
and
beauty
of
themselves
sufficiently
charming
they
will
be
found
of
very
little
use
in
the
affairs
of
real
life
the
highest
praise
which
the
ancient
romans
could
express
of
a
noble
matron
was
that
she
sat
at
home
and
span
domum
mansit
lanam
fecit
in
our
own
time
it
has
been
said
that
chemistry
enough
to
keep
the
pot
boiling
and
geography
enough
to
know
the
different
rooms
in
her
house
was
science
enough
for
any
woman
whilst
byron
whose
sympathies
for
woman
were
of
a
very
imperfect
kind
professed
that
he
would
limit
her
library
to
a
bible
and
a
but
this
view
of
character
and
culture
is
as
absurdly
narrow
and
unintelligent
on
the
one
hand
as
the
opposite
view
now
so
much
in
vogue
is
extravagant
and
unnatural
on
the
other
that
woman
ought
to
be
educated
so
as
to
be
as
much
as
possible
the
equal
of
man
undistinguishable
from
him
except
in
sex
equal
to
him
in
rights
and
votes
and
his
competitor
in
all
that
makes
life
a
fierce
and
selfish
struggle
for
place
and
power
and
money
speaking
generally
the
training
and
discipline
that
are
most
suitable
for
the
one
sex
in
early
life
are
also
the
most
suitable
for
the
other
and
the
education
and
culture
that
fill
the
mind
of
the
man
will
prove
equally
wholesome
for
the
woman
indeed
all
the
arguments
which
have
yet
been
advanced
in
favour
of
the
higher
education
of
men
plead
equally
strongly
in
favour
of
the
higher
education
of
women
in
all
the
departments
of
home
intelligence
will
add
to
woman
usefulness
and
efficiency
it
will
give
her
thought
and
forethought
enable
her
to
anticipate
and
provide
for
the
contingencies
of
life
suggest
improved
methods
of
management
and
give
her
strength
in
every
way
in
disciplined
mental
power
she
will
find
a
stronger
and
safer
protection
against
deception
and
imposture
than
in
mere
innocent
and
unsuspecting
ignorance
in
moral
and
religious
culture
she
will
secure
sources
of
influence
more
powerful
and
enduring
than
in
physical
attractions
and
in
due
and
she
will
discover
the
truest
sources
of
domestic
comfort
and
happiness
but
while
the
mind
and
character
of
women
ought
to
be
cultivated
with
a
view
to
their
own
wellbeing
they
ought
not
the
less
to
be
educated
liberally
with
a
view
to
the
happiness
of
others
men
themselves
can
not
be
sound
in
mind
or
morals
if
women
be
the
reverse
and
if
as
we
hold
to
be
the
case
the
moral
condition
of
a
people
mainly
depends
upon
the
education
of
the
home
then
the
education
of
women
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
matter
of
national
importance
not
only
does
the
moral
character
but
the
mental
strength
of
man
find
their
best
safeguard
and
support
in
the
moral
purity
and
mental
cultivation
of
woman
but
the
more
completely
the
powers
of
both
are
developed
the
more
harmonious
and
will
society
be
the
more
safe
and
certain
its
elevation
and
advancement
when
about
fifty
years
since
the
first
napoleon
said
that
the
great
want
of
france
was
mothers
he
meant
in
other
words
that
the
french
people
needed
the
education
of
homes
provided
over
by
good
virtuous
intelligent
women
indeed
the
first
french
revolution
presented
one
of
the
most
striking
illustrations
of
the
social
mischiefs
resulting
from
a
neglect
of
the
purifying
influence
of
women
when
that
great
national
outbreak
occurred
society
was
impenetrated
with
vice
and
profligacy
morals
religion
virtue
were
swamped
by
sensualism
the
character
of
woman
had
become
depraved
conjugal
fidelity
was
disregarded
maternity
was
held
in
reproach
family
and
home
were

france
was
motherless
the
children
broke
loose
and
the
revolution
burst
forth
amidst
the
yells
and
the
fierce
violence
of
women
but
the
terrible
lesson
was
disregarded
and
again
and
again
france
has
grievously
suffered
from
the
want
of
that
discipline
obedience
and
which
can
only
be
truly
learnt
at
home
it
is
said
that
the
third
napoleon
attributed
the
recent
powerlessness
of
france
which
left
her
helpless
and
bleeding
at
the
feet
of
her
conquerors
to
the
frivolity
and
lack
of
principle
of
the
people
as
well
as
to
their
love
of
pleasure
which
however
it
must
be
confessed
he
himself
did
not
a
little
to
foster
it
would
thus
seem
that
the
discipline
which
france
still
needs
to
learn
if
she
would
be
good
and
great
is
that
indicated
by
the
first
napoleon
home
education
by
good
mothers
the
influence
of
woman
is
the
same
everywhere
her
condition
influences
the
morals
manners
and
character
of
the
people
in
all
countries
where
she
is
debased
society
is
debased
where
she
is
morally
pure
and
enlightened
society
will
be
proportionately
elevated
hence
to
instruct
woman
is
to
instruct
man
to
elevate
her
character
is
to
raise
his
own
to
enlarge
her
mental
freedom
is
to
extend
and
secure
that
of
the
whole
community
for
nations
are
but
the
outcomes
of
homes
and
peoples
of
mothers
but
while
it
is
certain
that
the
character
of
a
nation
will
be
elevated
by
the
enlightenment
and
refinement
of
woman
it
is
much
more
than
doubtful
whether
any
advantage
is
to
be
derived
from
her
entering
into
competition
with
man
in
the
rough
work
of
business
and
polities
women
can
no
more
do
men
special
work
in
the
world
than
men
can
do
women
and
wherever
woman
has
been
withdrawn
from
her
home
and
family
to
enter
upon
other
work
the
result
has
been
socially
disastrous
indeed
the
efforts
of
some
of
the
best
philanthropists
have
of
late
years
been
devoted
to
withdrawing
women
from
toiling
alongside
of
men
in
coalpits
factories
nailshops
and
brickyards
it
is
still
not
uncommon
in
the
north
for
the
husbands
to
be
idle
at
home
while
the
mothers
and
daughters
are
working
in
the
factory
the
result
being
in
many
cases
an
entire
subversion
of
family
order
of
domestic
discipline
and
of
home
rule
and
for
many
years
past
in
paris
that
state
of
things
has
been
reached
which
some
women
desire
to
effect
amongst
ourselves
the
women
there
mainly
attend
to
business
serving
the
boutique
or
presiding
at
the
comptoir
while
the
men
lounge
about
the
boulevards
but
the
result
has
only
been
homelessness
degeneracy
and
family
and
social
decay
nor
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
elevation
and
improvement
of
women
are
to
be
secured
by
investing
them
with
political
power
there
are
however
in
these
days
many
believers
in
the
potentiality
of
votes
who
anticipate
some
indefinite
good
from
the
enfranchisement
of
women
it
is
not
necessary
here
to
enter
upon
the
discussion
of
this
question
but
it
may
be
sufficient
to
state
that
the
power
which
women
do
not
possess
politically
is
far
more
than
compensated
by
that
which
they
exercise
in
private
life
by
their
training
in
the
home
those
who
whether
as
men
or
as
women
do
all
the
manly
as
well
as
womanly
work
of
the
world
the
radical
bentham
has
said
that
man
even
if
he
would
can
not
keep
power
from
woman
for
that
she
already
governs
the
world
with
the
whole
power
of
a
despot
though
the
power
that
she
mainly
governs
by
is
love
and
to
form
the
character
of
the
whole
human
race
is
certainly
a
power
far
greater
than
that
which
women
could
ever
hope
to
exercise
as
voters
for
members
of
parliament
or
even
as
lawmakers
there
is
however
one
special
department
of
woman
work
demanding
the
earnest
attention
of
all
true
female
reformers
though
it
is
one
which
has
hitherto
been
unaccountably
neglected
we
mean
the
better
economizing
and
preparation
of
human
food
the
waste
of
which
at
present
for
want
of
the
most
ordinary
culinary
knowledge
is
little
short
of
scandalous
if
that
man
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
benefactor
of
his
species
who
makes
two
stalks
of
corn
to
grow
where
only
one
grew
before
not
less
is
she
to
be
regarded
as
a
public
benefactor
who
economizes
and
turns
to
the
best
practical
account
the
of
human
skill
and
labour
the
improved
use
of
even
our
existing
supply
would
be
equivalent
to
an
immediate
extension
of
the
cultivable
acreage
of
our
country
not
to
speak
of
the
increase
in
health
economy
and
domestic
comfort
were
our
female
reformers
only
to
turn
their
energies
in
this
direction
with
effect
they
would
earn
the
gratitude
of
all
households
and
be
esteemed
as
among
the
greatest
of

philanthropists

owen
feltham
the
natural
education
of
the
home
is
prolonged
far
into
life
indeed
it
never
entirely
ceases
but
the
time
arrives
in
the
progress
of
years
when
the
home
ceases
to
exercise
an
exclusive
influence
on
the
formation
of
character
and
it
is
succeeded
by
the
more
artificial
education
of
the
school
and
the
companionship
of
friends
and
comrades
which
continue
to
mould
the
character
by
the
powerful
influence
of
example
men
young
and
old
but
the
young
more
than
the
old
can
not
help
imitating
those
with
whom
they
associate
it
was
a
saying
of
george
herbert
mother
intended
for
the
guidance
of
her
sons
that
as
our
bodies
take
a
nourishment
suitable
to
the
meat
on
which
we
feed
so
do
our
souls
as
insensibly
take
in
virtue
or
vice
by
the
example
or
conversation
of
good
or
bad
company
indeed
it
is
impossible
that
association
with
those
about
us
should
not
produce
a
powerful
influence
in
the
formation
of
character
for
men
are
by
nature
imitators
and
all
persons
are
more
or
less
impressed
by
the
speech
the
manners
the
gait
the
gestures
and
the
very
habits
of
thinking
of
their
companions

grand
motto
which
he
wrote
for
the
tablet
of
the
marquis
of
rockingham
is
worth
repeating
it
was
remember
resemble
persevere
imitation
is
for
the
most
part
so
unconscious
that
its
effects
are
almost
unheeded
but
its
influence
is
not
the
less
permanent
on
that
account
it
is
only
when
an
impressive
nature
is
placed
in
contact
with
an
impressionable
one
that
the
alteration
in
the
character
becomes
recognisable
yet
even
the
weakest
natures
exercise
some
influence
upon
those
about
them
the
approximation
of
feeling

and

constant

unceasing
emerson
has
observed
that
even
old
couples
or
persons
who
have
been
housemates
for
a
course
of
years
grow
gradually
like
each
other
so
that
if
they
were
to
live
long
enough
we
should
scarcely
be
able
to
know
them
apart
but
if
this
be
true
of
the
old
how
much
more
true
is
it
of
the
young
whose
plastic
natures
are
so
much
more
soft
and
impressionable
and
ready
to
take
the
stamp
of
the
life
and
conversation
of
those
about
them
there
has
been
observed
sir
charles
bell
in
one
of
his
letters
a
good
deal
said
about
education
but
they
appear
to
me
to
put
out
of
sight
example
which
is
my
best
education
was
the
example
set
me
by
my
brothers
there
was
in
all
the
members
of
the
family
a
reliance
on
self
a
true
independence
and
by
imitation
i
obtained
it
it
is
in
the
nature
of
things
that
the
circumstances
which
contribute
to
form
the
character
should
exercise
their
principal
influence
during
the
period
of
growth
as
years
advance
example
and
imitation
become
custom
and
gradually
consolidate
into
habit
which
is
of
so
much
potency
that
almost
before
we
know
it
we
have
in
a
measure
yielded
up
to
it
our
personal
freedom
it
is
related
of
plato
that
on
one
occasion
he
reproved
a
boy
for
playing
at
some
foolish
game
thou
reprovest
me
said
the
boy
for
a
very
little
thing
but
custom
replied
plato
is
not
a
little
thing
bad
custom
consolidated
into
habit
is
such
a
tyrant
that
men
sometimes
cling
to
vices
even
while
they
curse
them
they
have
become
the
slaves
of
habits
whose
power
they
are
impotent
to
resist
hence
locke
has
said
that
to
create
and
maintain
that
vigour
of
mind
which
is
able
to
contest
the
empire
of
habit
may
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
chief
ends
of
moral
discipline
though
much
of
the
education
of
character
by
example
is
spontaneous
and
unconscious
the
young
need
not
necessarily
be
the
passive
followers
or
imitators
of
those
about
them
their
own
conduct
far
more
than
the
conduct
of
their
companions
tends
to
fix
the
purpose
and
form
the
principles
of
their
life
each
possesses
in
himself
a
power
of
will
and
of
free
activity
which
if
courageously
exercised
will
enable
him
to
make
his
own
individual
selection
of
friends
and
associates
it
is
only
through
weakness
of
purpose
that
young
people
as
well
as
old
become
the
slaves
of
their
inclinations
or
give
themselves
up
to
a
servile
imitation
of
others
it
is
a
common
saying
that
men
are
known
by
the
company
they
keep
the
sober
do
not
naturally
associate
with
the
drunken
the
refined
with
the
coarse
the
decent
with
the
dissolute
to
associate
with
depraved
persons
argues
a
low
taste
and
vicious
tendencies
and
to
frequent
their
society
leads
to
inevitable
degradation
of
character
the
conversation
of
such
persons
says
seneca
is
very
injurious
for
even
if
it
does
no
immediate
harm
it
leaves
its
seeds
in
the
mind
and
follows
us
when
we
have
gone
from
the
speakers
a
plague
sure
to
spring
up
in
future
resurrection
if
young
men
are
wisely
influenced
and
directed
and
conscientiously
exert
their
own
free
energies
they
will
seek
the
society
of
those
better
than
themselves
and
strive
to
imitate
their
example
in
companionship
with
the
good
growing
natures
will
always
find
their
best
nourishment
while
companionship
with
the
bad
will
only
be
fruitful
in
mischief
there
are
persons
whom
to
know
is
to
love
honour
and
admire
and
others
whom
to
know
is
to
shun
and
despise
dont

as
says
rabelais
when
speaking
of
the

with
persons
of
elevated
characters
and
you
will
feel
lifted

the
spanish
proverb
and

intercourse
with
even
commonplace
selfish
persons
may
prove
most
injurious
by
inducing
a
dry
dull
reserved
and
selfish
condition
of
mind
more
or
less
inimical
to
true
manliness
and
breadth
of
character
the
mind
soon
learns
to
run
in
small
grooves
the
heart
grows
narrow
and
contracted
and
the
moral
nature
becomes
weak
irresolute
and
accommodating
which
is
fatal
to
all
generous
ambition
or
real
excellence
on
the
other
hand
association
with
persons
wiser
better
and
more
experienced
than
ourselves
is
always
more
or
less
inspiring
and
invigorating
they
enhance
our
own
knowledge
of
life
we
correct
our
estimates
by
theirs
and
become
partners
in
their
wisdom
we
enlarge
our
field
of
observation
through
their
eyes
profit
by
their
experience
and
learn
not
only
from
what
they
have
enjoyed
but
which
is
still
more
instructive
from
what
they
have
suffered
if
they
are
stronger
than
ourselves
we
become
participators
in
their
strength
hence
companionship
with
the
wise
and
energetic
never
fails
to
have
a
most
valuable
influence
on
the
formation
of
character
increasing
our
resources
strengthening
our
resolves
elevating
our
aims
and
enabling
us
to
exercise
greater
dexterity
and
ability
in
our
own
affairs
as
well
as
more
effective
helpfulness
of
others
i
have
often
deeply
regretted
in
myself
says
schimmelpenninck
the
great
loss
i
have
experienced
from
the
solitude
of
my
early
habits
we
need
no
worse
companion
than
our
unregenerate
selves
and
by
living
alone
a
person
not
only
becomes
wholly
ignorant
of
the
means
of
helping
his
but
is
without
the
perception
of
those
wants
which
most
need
help
association
with
others
when
not
on
so
large
a
scale
as
to
make
hours
of
retirement
impossible
may
be
considered
as
furnishing
to
an
individual
a
rich
multiplied
experience
and
sympathy
so
drawn
forth
though
unlike
charity
it
begins
abroad
never
fails
to
bring
back
rich
treasures
home
association
with
others
is
useful
also
in
strengthening
the
character
and
in
enabling
us
while
we
never
lose
sight
of
our
main
object
to
thread
our
way
wisely
and
well
an
entirely
new
direction
may
be
given
to
the
life
of
a
young
man
by
a
happy
suggestion
a
timely
hint
or
the
kindly
advice
of
an
honest
friend
thus
the
life
of
henry
martyn
the
indian
missionary
seems
to
have
been
singularly
influenced
by
a
friendship
which
he
formed
when
a
boy
at
truro
grammar
school
martyn
himself
was
of
feeble
frame
and
of
a
delicate
nervous
temperament
wanting
in
animal
spirits
he
took
but
little
pleasure
in
school
sports
and
being
of
a
somewhat
petulant
temper
the
bigger
boys
took
pleasure
in
provoking
him
and
some
of
them
in
bullying
him
one
of
the
bigger
boys
however
conceiving
a
friendship
for
martyn
took
him
under
his
protection
stood
between
him
and
his
persecutors
and
not
only
fought
his
battles
for
him
but
helped
him
with
his
lessons
though
martyn
was
rather
a
backward
pupil
his
father
was
desirous
that
he
should
have
the
advantage
of
a
college
education
and
at
the
age
of
about
fifteen
he
sent
him
to
oxford
to
try
for
a
corpus
scholarship
in
which
he
failed
he
remained
for
two
years
more
at
the
truro
grammar
school
and
then
went
to
cambridge
where
he
was
entered
at
john
college
who
should
he
find
already
settled
there
as
a
student
but
his
old
champion
of
the
truro
grammar
school
their
friendship
was
renewed
and
the
elder
student
from
that
time
forward
acted
as
the
mentor
of
the
younger
one
martyn
was
fitful
in
his
studies
excitable
and
petulant
and
occasionally
subject
to
fits
of
almost
uncontrollable
rage
his
big
friend
on
the
other
hand
was
a
steady
patient
hardworking
fellow
and
he
never
ceased
to
watch
over
to
guide
and
to
advise
for
good
his
irritable
he
kept
martyn
out
of
the
way
of
evil
company
advised
him
to
work
hard
not
for
the
praise
of
men
but
for
the
glory
of
god
and
so
successfully
assisted
him
in
his
studies
that
at
the
following
christmas
examination
he
was
the
first
of
his
year
yet
martyn
kind
friend
and
mentor
never
achieved
any
distinction
himself
he
passed
away
into
obscurity
leading
most
probably
a
useful
though
an
unknown
career
his
greatest
wish
in
life
having
been
to
shape
the
character
of
his
friend
to
inspire
his
soul
with
the
love
of
truth
and
to
prepare
him
for
the
noble
work
on
which
he
shortly
after
entered
of
an
indian
missionary
a
somewhat
similar
incident
is
said
to
have
occurred
in
the
college
career
of
paley
when
a
student
at
christ
college
cambridge
he
was
distinguished
for
his
shrewdness
as
well
as
his
clumsiness
and
he
was
at
the
same
time
the
favourite
and
the
butt
of
his
companions
though
his
natural
abilities
were
great
he
was
thoughtless
idle
and
a
spendthrift
and
at
the
commencement
of
his
third
year
he
had
made
comparatively
little
progress
after
one
of
his
usual
a
friend
stood
by
his
bedside
on
the
following
morning
paley
said
he
i
have
not
been
able
to
sleep
for
thinking
about
you
i
have
been
thinking
what
a
fool
you
are
i
have
the
means
of
dissipation
and
can
afford
to
be
idle
you
are
poor
and
can
not
afford
it
i
could
do
nothing
probably
even
were
i
to
try
you
are
capable
of
doing
anything
i
have
lain
awake
all
night
thinking
about
your
folly
and
i
have
now
come
solemnly
to
warn
you
indeed
if
you
persist
in
your
indolence
and
go
on
in
this
way
i
must
renounce
your
society
altogether
it
is
said
that
paley
was
so
powerfully
affected
by
this
admonition
that
from
that
moment
he
became
an
altered
man
he
formed
an
entirely
new
plan
of
life
and
diligently
persevered
in
it
he
became
one
of
the
most
industrious
of
students
one
by
one
he
distanced
his
competitors
and
at
the
end
of
the
year
he
came
out
senior
wrangler
what
he
afterwards
accomplished
as
an
author
and
a
divine
is
sufficiently
well
known
no
one
recognised
more
fully
the
influence
of
personal
example
on
the
young
than
did
arnold
it
was
the
great
lever
with
which
he
worked
in
striving
to
elevate
the
character
of
his
school
he
made
it
his
principal
object
first
to
put
a
right
spirit
into
the
leading
boys
by
attracting
their
good
and
noble
feelings
and
then
to
make
them
instrumental
in
propagating
the
same
spirit
among
the
rest
by
the
influence
of
imitation
example
and
admiration
he
endeavoured
to
make
all
feel
that
they
were
with
himself
and
sharers
with
him
in
the
moral
responsibility
for
the
good
government
of
the
place
one
of
the
first
effects
of
this
highminded
system
of
management
was
that
it
inspired
the
boys
with
strength
and
they
felt
that
they
were
trusted
there
were
of
course
mauvais
sujets
at
rugby
as
there
are
at
all
schools
and
these
it
was
the
master
duty
to
watch
to
prevent
their
bad
example
contaminating
others
on
one
occasion
he
said
to
an
do
you
see
those
two
boys
walking
together
i
never
saw
them
together
before
you
should
make
an
especial
point
of
observing
the
company
they
keep
nothing
so
tells
the
changes
in
a
boy
character
arnold
own
example
was
an
inspiration
as
is
that
of
every
great
teacher
in
his
presence
young
men
learned
to
respect
themselves
and
out
of
the
root
of
there
grew
up
the
manly
virtues
his
very
presence
says
his
biographer
seemed
to
create
a
new
spring
of
health
and
vigour
within
them
and
to
give
to
life
an
interest
and
elevation
which
remained
with
them
long
after
they
had
left
him
and
dwelt
so
habitually
in
their
thoughts
as
a
living
image
that
when
death
had
taken
him
away
the
bond
appeared
to
be
still
unbroken
and
the
sense
of
separation
almost
lost
in
the
still
deeper
sense
of
a
life
and
a
union
indestructible
and
thus
it
was
that
arnold
trained
a
host
of
manly
and
noble
characters
who
spread
the
influence
of
his
example
in
all
parts
of
the
world
so
also
was
it
said
of
dugald
stewart
that
he
breathed
the
love
of
virtue
into
whole
generations
of
pupils
to
me
says
the
late
lord
cockburn
his
lectures
were
like
the
opening
of
the
heavens
i
felt
that
i
had
a
soul
his
noble
views
unfolded
in
glorious
sentences
elevated
me
into
a
higher
world
they
changed
my
whole
nature
character
tells
in
all
conditions
of
life
the
man
of
good
character
in
a
workshop
will
give
the
tone
to
his
fellows
and
elevate
their
entire
aspirations
thus
franklin
while
a
workman
in
london
is
said
to
have
reformed
the
manners
of
an
entire
workshop
so
the
man
of
bad
character
and
debased
energy
will
unconsciously
lower
and
degrade
his
fellows
captain
john
brown
the
brown
once
said
to
emerson
that
for
a
settler
in
a
new
country
one
good
believing
man
is
worth
a
hundred
nay
worth
a
thousand
men
without
character
his
example
is
so
contagious
that
all
other
men
are
directly
and
beneficially
influenced
by
him
and
he
insensibly
elevates
and
lifts
them
up
to
his
own
standard
of
energetic
activity
communication
with
the
good
is
invariably
productive
of
good
the
good
character
is
diffusive
in
his
influence
i
was
common
clay
till
roses
were
planted
in
me
says
some
aromatic
earth
in
the
eastern
fable
like
begets
like
and
good
makes
good
it
is
astonishing
says
canon
moseley
how
much
good
goodness
makes
nothing
that
is
good
is
alone
nor
anything
bad
it
makes
others
good
or
others
bad
and
that
other
and
so
on
like
a
stone
thrown
into
a
pond
which
makes
circles
that
make
other
wider
ones
and
then
others
till
the
last
reaches
the
shore
almost
all
the
good
that
is
in
the
world
has
i
suppose
thus
come
down
to
us
traditionally
from
remote
times
and
often
unknown
centres
of
good
so
ruskin
says
that
which
is
born
of
evil
begets
evil
and
that
which
is
born
of
valour
and
honour
teaches
valour
and
honour
hence
it
is
that
the
life
of
every
man
is
a
daily
inculcation
of
good
or
bad
example
to
others
the
life
of
a
good
man
is
at
the
same
time
the
most
eloquent
lesson
of
virtue
and
the
most
severe
reproof
of
vice
hooker
described
the
life
of
a
pious
clergyman
of
his
acquaintance
as
visible
rhetoric
convincing
even
the
most
godless
of
the
beauty
of
goodness
and
so
the
good
george
herbert
said
on
entering
upon
the
duties
of
his
parish
above
all
i
will
be
sure
to
live
well
because
the
virtuous
life
of
a
clergyman
is
the
most
powerful
eloquence
to
persuade
all
who
see
it
to
reverence
and
love
and
at
least
to
desire
to
live
like
him
and
this
i
will
do
he
added
because
i
know
we
live
in
an
age
that
hath
more
need
of
good
examples
than
precepts
it
was
a
fine
saying
of
the
same
good
priest
when
reproached
with
doing
an
act
of
kindness
to
a
poor
man
considered
beneath
the
dignity
of
his
office
that
the
thought
of
such
actions
would
prove
music
to
him
at
midnight
izaak
walton
speaks
of
a
letter
written
by
george
herbert
to
bishop
andrewes
about
a
holy
life
which
the
latter
put
into
his
bosom
and
after
showing
it
to
his
scholars
did
always
return
it
to
the
place
where
he
first
lodged
it
and
continued
it
so
near
his
heart
till
the
last
day
of
his
life
great
is
the
power
of
goodness
to
charm
and
to
command
the
man
inspired
by
it
is
the
true
king
of
men
drawing
all
hearts
after
him
when
general
nicholson
lay
wounded
on
his
deathbed
before
delhi
he
dictated
this
last
message
to
his
equally
noble
and
gallant
friend
sir
herbert
edwardes
tell
him
said
he
i
should
have
been
a
better
man
if
i
had
continued
to
live
with
him
and
our
heavy
public
duties
had
not
prevented
my
seeing
more
of
him
privately
i
was
always
the
better
for
a
residence
with
him
and
his
wife
however
short
give
my
love
to
them
both
there
are
men
in
whose
presence
we
feel
as
if
we
breathed
a
spiritual
ozone
refreshing
and
invigorating
like
inhaling
mountain
air
or
enjoying
a
bath
of
sunshine
the
power
of
sir
thomas
more
gentle
nature
was
so
great
that
it
subdued
the
bad
at
the
same
time
that
it
inspired
the
good
lord
brooke
said
of
his
deceased
friend
sir
philip
sidney
that
his
wit
and
understanding
beat
upon
his
heart
to
make
himself
and
others
not
in
word
or
opinion
but
in
life
and
action
good
and
great
the
very
sight
of
a
great
and
good
man
is
often
an
inspiration
to
the
young
who
can
not
help
admiring
and
loving
the
gentle
the
brave
the
truthful
the
magnanimous
chateaubriand
saw
washington
only
once
but
it
inspired
him
for
life
after
describing
the
interview
he
says
washington
sank
into
the
tomb
before
any
little
celebrity
had
attached
to
my
name
i
passed
before
him
as
the
most
unknown
of
beings
he
was
in
all
his
glory
i
in
the
depth
of
my
obscurity
my
name
probably
dwelt
not
a
whole
day
in
his
memory
happy
however
was
i
that
his
looks
were
cast
upon
me
i
have
felt
warmed
for
it
all
the
rest
of
my
life
there
is
a
virtue
even
in
the
looks
of
a
great
man
when
niebuhr
died
his
friend
frederick
perthes
said
of
him
what
a
contemporary
the
terror
of
all
bad
and
base
men
the
stay
of
all
the
sterling
and
honest
the
friend
and
helper
of
youth
perthes
said
on
another
occasion
it
does
a
wrestling
man
good
to
be
constantly
surrounded
by
tried
wrestlers
evil
thoughts
are
put
to
flight
when
the
eye
falls
on
the
portrait
of
one
in
whose
living
presence
one
would
have
blushed
to
own
them
a
catholic
when
about
to
cheat
was
wont
to
draw
a
veil
over
the
picture
of
his
favourite
saint
so
hazlitt
has
said
of
the
portrait
of
a
beautiful
female
that
it
seemed
as
if
an
unhandsome
action
would
be
impossible
in
its
presence
it
does
one
good
to
look
upon
his
manly
honest
face
said
a
poor
german
woman
pointing
to
a
portrait
of
the
great
reformer
hung
upon
the
wall
of
her
humble
dwelling
even
the
portrait
of
a
noble
or
a
good
man
hung
up
in
a
room
is
companionship
after
a
sort
it
gives
us
a
closer
personal
interest
in
him
looking
at
the
features
we
feel
as
if
we
knew
him
better
and
were
more
nearly
related
to
him
it
is
a
link
that
connects
us
with
a
higher
and
better
nature
than
our
own
and
though
we
may
be
far
from
reaching
the
standard
of
our
hero
we
are
to
a
certain
extent
sustained
and
fortified
by
his
depicted
presence
constantly
before
us
fox
was
proud
to
acknowledge
how
much
he
owed
to
the
example
and
conversation
of
burke
on
one
occasion
he
said
of
him
that
if
he
was
to
put
all
the
political
information
he
had
gained
from
books
all
that
he
had
learned
from
science
or
that
the
knowledge
of
the
world
and
its
affairs
taught
him
into
one
scale
and
the
improvement
he
had
derived
from
burke
conversation
and
instruction
into
the
other
the
latter
would
preponderate
professor
tyndall
speaks
of
faraday
friendship
as
energy
and
inspiration
after
spending
an
evening
with
him
he
wrote
his
work
excites
admiration
but
contact
with
him
warms
and
elevates
the
heart
here
surely
is
a
strong
man
i
love
strength
but
let
me
not
forget
the
example
of
its
union
with
modesty
tenderness
and
sweetness
in
the
character
of
faraday
even
the
gentlest
natures
are
powerful
to
influence
the
character
of
others
for
good
thus
wordsworth
seems
to
have
been
especially
impressed
by
the
character
of
his
sister
dorothy
who
exercised
upon
his
mind
and
heart
a
lasting
influence
he
describes
her
as
the
blessing
of
his
boyhood
as
well
as
of
his
manhood
though
two
years
younger
than
himself
her
tenderness
and
sweetness
contributed
greatly
to
mould
his
nature
and
open
his
mind
to
the
influences
of
poetry
she
gave
me
eyes
she
gave
me
ears
and
humble
cares
and
delicate
fears
a
heart
the
fountain
of
sweet
tears
and
love
and
thought
and
joy
thus
the
gentlest
natures
are
enabled
by
the
power
of
affection
and
intelligence
to
mould
the
characters
of
men
destined
to
influence
and
elevate
their
race
through
all
time
sir
william
napier
attributed
the
early
direction
of
his
character
first
to
the
impress
made
upon
it
by
his
mother
when
a
boy
and
afterwards
to
the
noble
example
of
his
commander
sir
john
moore
when
a
man
moore
early
detected
the
qualities
of
the
young
officer
and
he
was
one
of
those
to
whom
the
general
addressed
the
encouragement
well
done
my
majors
at
corunna
writing
home
to
his
mother
and
describing
the
little
court
by
which
moore
was
surrounded
he
wrote
where
shall
we
find
such
a
king
it
was
to
his
personal
affection
for
his
chief
that
the
world
is
mainly
indebted
to
sir
william
napier
for
his
great
book
history
of
the
peninsular
war
but
he
was
stimulated
to
write
the
book
by
the
advice
of
another
friend
the
late
lord
langdale
while
one
day
walking
with
him
across
the
fields
on
which
belgravia
is
now
built
it
was
lord
langdale
he
says
who
first
kindled
the
fire
within
me
and
of
sir
william
napier
himself
his
biographer
truly
says
that
no
thinking
person
could
ever
come
in
contact
with
him
without
being
strongly
impressed
with
the
genius
of
the
man
the
career
of
the
late
marshall
hall
was
a
lifelong
illustration
of
the
influence
of
character
in
forming
character
many
eminent
men
still
living
trace
their
success
in
life
to
his
suggestions
and
assistance
without
which
several
valuable
lines
of
study
and
investigation
might
not
have
been
entered
on
at
least
at
so
early
a
period
he
would
say
to
young
men
about
him
take
up
a
subject
and
pursue
it
well
and
you
can
not
fail
to
succeed
and
often
he
would
throw
out
a
new
idea
to
a
young
friend
saying
i
make
you
a
present
of
it
there
is
fortune
in
it
if
you
pursue
it
with
energy
energy
of
character
has
always
a
power
to
evoke
energy
in
others
it
acts
through
sympathy
one
of
the
most
influential
of
human
agencies
the
zealous
energetic
man
unconsciously
carries
others
along
with
him
his
example
is
contagious
and
compels
imitation
he
exercises
a
sort
of
electric
power
which
sends
a
thrill
through
every
fibre
flows
into
the
nature
of
those
about
him
and
makes
them
give
out
sparks
of
fire
arnold
biographer
speaking
of
the
power
of
this
kind
exercised
by
him
over
young
men
says
it
was
not
so
much
an
enthusiastic
admiration
for
true
genius
or
learning
or
eloquence
which
stirred
within
them
it
was
a
sympathetic
thrill
caught
from
a
spirit
that
was
earnestly
at
work
in
the
world
whose
work
was
healthy
sustained
and
constantly
carried
forward
in
the
fear
of
god
a
work
that
was
founded
on
a
deep
sense
of
its
duty
and
its
value
such
a
power
exercised
by
men
of
genius
evokes
courage
enthusiasm
and
devotion
it
is
this
intense
admiration
for
individuals
such
as
one
can
not
conceive
entertained
for
a
multitude
which
has
in
all
times
produced
heroes
and
martyrs
it
is
thus
that
the
mastery
of
character
makes
itself
felt
it
acts
by
inspiration
quickening
and
vivifying
the
natures
subject
to
its
influence
great
minds
are
rich
in
radiating
force
not
only
exerting
power
but
communicating
and
even
creating
it
thus
dante
raised
and
drew
after
him
a
host
of
great
spirits
petrarch
boccacio
tasso
and
many
more
from
him
milton
learnt
to
bear
the
stings
of
evil
tongues
and
the
contumely
of
evil
days
and
long
years
after
byron
thinking
of
dante
under
the
of
ravenna
was
incited
to
attune
his
harp
to
loftier
strains
than
he
had
ever
attempted
before
dante
inspired
the
greatest
painters
of
italy
giotto
orcagna
michael
angelo
and
raphael
so
ariosto
and
titian
mutually
inspired
one
another
and
lighted
up
each
other
glory
great
and
good
men
draw
others
after
them
exciting
the
spontaneous
admiration
of
mankind
this
admiration
of
noble
character
elevates
the
mind
and
tends
to
redeem
it
from
the
bondage
of
self
one
of
the
greatest
stumbling
blocks
to
moral
improvement
the
recollection
of
men
who
have
signalised
themselves
by
great
thoughts
or
great
deeds
seems
as
if
to
create
for
the
time
a
purer
atmosphere
around
us
and
we
feel
as
if
our

you

i
will
tell
you
what
you
are
at

as
regards
your
talents
tastes
and
character

you
admire
mean

your

you
admire
honest

manly
men
you
are
yourself
of
an
honest
brave
and
manly
spirit
it
is
in
the
season
of
youth
while
the
character
is
forming
that
the
impulse
to
admire
is
the
greatest
as
we
advance
in
life
we
crystallize
into
habit
and
nil
admirari
too
often
becomes
our
motto
it
is
well
to
encourage
the
admiration
of
great
characters
while
the
nature
is
plastic
and
open
to
impressions
for
if
the
good
are
not
admired
as
young
men
will
have
their
heroes
of
some
sort
most
probably
the
great
bad
may
be
taken
by
them
for
models
hence
it
always
rejoiced
arnold
to
hear
his
pupils
expressing
admiration
of
great
deeds
or
full
of
enthusiasm
for
persons
or
even
scenery
i
believe
said
he
that
admirari
is
the
devil
favourite
text
and
he
could
not
choose
a
better
to
introduce
his
pupils
into
the
more
esoteric
parts
of
his
doctrine
and
therefore
i
have
always
looked
upon
a
man
infected
with
the
disorder
of
as
one
who
has
lost
the
finest
part
of
his
nature
and
his
best
protection
against
everything
low
and
foolish
it
was
a
fine
trait
in
the
character
of
prince
albert
that
he
was
always
so
ready
to
express
generous
admiration
of
the
good
deeds
of
others
he
had
the
greatest
delight
says
the
ablest
delineator
of
his
character
in
anybody
else
saying
a
fine
saying
or
doing
a
great
deed
he
would
rejoice
over
it
and
talk
about
it
for
days
and
whether
it
was
a
thing
nobly
said
or
done
by
a
little
child
or
by
a
veteran
statesman
it
gave
him
equal
pleasure
he
delighted
in
humanity
doing
well
on
any
occasion
and
in
any
manner
no
quality
said
johnson
will
get
a
man
more
friends
than
a
sincere
admiration
of
the
qualities
of
others
it
indicates
generosity
of
nature
frankness
cordiality
and
cheerful
recognition
of
merit
it
was
to
the
sincere
it
might
almost
be
said
the
reverential
admiration
of
johnson
by
boswell
that
we
owe
one
of
the
best
biographies
ever
written
one
is
disposed
to
think
that
there
must
have
been
some
genuine
good
qualities
in
boswell
to
have
been
attracted
by
such
a
man
as
johnson
and
to
have
kept
faithful
to
his
worship
in
spite
of
rebuffs
and
snubbings
innumerable
macaulay
speaks
of
boswell
as
an
altogether
contemptible
person
as
a
coxcomb
and
a
bore
weak
vain
pushing
curious
garrulous
and
without
wit
humour
or
eloquence
but
carlyle
is
doubtless
more
just
in
his
characterisation
of
the
biographer
in
whom
vain
and
foolish
though
he
was
in
many
respects
he
sees
a
man
penetrated
by
the
old
reverent
feeling
of
discipleship
full
of
love
and
admiration
for
true
wisdom
and
excellence
without
such
qualities
carlyle
insists
the
of
johnson
never
could
have
been
written
boswell
wrote
a
good
book
he
says
because
he
had
a
heart
and
an
eye
to
discern
wisdom
and
an
utterance
to
render
it
forth
because
of
his
free
insight
his
lively
talent
and
above
all
of
his
love
and
childlike
openmindedness
most
young
men
of
generous
mind
have
their
heroes
especially
if
they
be
thus
allan
cunningham
when
a
mason
apprentice
in
nithsdale
walked
all
the
way
to
edinburgh
for
the
sole
purpose
of
seeing
sir
walter
scott
as
he
passed
along
the
street
we
unconsciously
admire
the
enthusiasm
of
the
lad
and
respect
the
impulse
which
impelled
him
to
make
the
journey
it
is
related
of
sir
joshua
reynolds
that
when
a
boy
of
ten
he
thrust
his
hand
through
intervening
rows
of
people
to
touch
pope
as
if
there
were
a
sort
of
virtue
in
the
contact
at
a
much
later
period
the
painter
haydon
was
proud
to
see
and
to
touch
reynolds
when
on
a
visit
to
his
native
place
rogers
the
poet
used
to
tell
of
his
ardent
desire
when
a
boy
to
see
johnson
but
when
his
hand
was
on
the
knocker
of
the
house
in
bolt
court
his
courage
failed
him
and
he
turned
away
so
the
late
isaac
disraeli
when
a
youth
called
at
bolt
court
for
the
same
purpose
and
though
he
had
the
courage
to
knock
to
his
dismay
he
was
informed
by
the
servant
that
the
great
lexicographer
had
breathed
his
last
only
a
few
hours
before
on
the
contrary
small
and
ungenerous
minds
can
not
admire
heartily
to
their
own
great
misfortune
they
can
not
recognise
much
less
reverence
great
men
and
great
things
the
mean
nature
admires
meanly
the
highest
idea
of
beauty
is
his
toadess
the
small
snob
highest
idea
of
manhood
is
the
great
snob
the
values
a
man
according
to
his
muscles
when
a
guinea
trader
was
told
by
sir
godfrey
kneller
in
the
presence
of
pope
that
he
saw
before
him
two
of
the
greatest
men
in
the
world
he
replied
i
do
know
how
great
you
may
be
but
i
like
your
looks
i
have
often
bought
a
man
much
better
than
both
of
you
together
all
bones
and
muscles
for
ten
guineas
although
rochefoucauld
in
one
of
his
maxims
says
that
there
is
something
that
is
not
altogether
disagreeable
to
us
in
the
misfortunes
of
even
our
best
friends
it
is
only
the
small
and
essentially
mean
nature
that
finds
pleasure
in
the
disappointment
and
annoyance
at
the
success
of
others
there
are
unhappily
for
themselves
persons
so
constituted
that
they
have
not
the
heart
to
be
generous
the
most
disagreeable
of
all
people
are
those
who
sit
in
the
seat
of
the
scorner
persons
of
this
sort
often
come
to
regard
the
success
of
others
even
in
a
good
work
as
a
kind
of
personal
offence
they
can
not
bear
to
hear
another
praised
especially
if
he
belong
to
their
own
art
or
calling
or
profession
they
will
pardon
a
man
failures
but
can
not
forgive
his
doing
a
thing
better
than
they
can
do
and
where
they
have
themselves
failed
they
are
found
to
be
the
most
merciless
of
detractors
the
sour
critic
thinks
of
his
rival
when
heaven
with
such
parts
has
blest
him
have
i
not
reason
to
detest
him
the
mean
mind
occupies
itself
with
sneering
carping
and
and
is
ready
to
scoff
at
everything
but
impudent
effrontery
or
successful
vice
the
greatest
consolation
of
such
persons
are
the
defects
of
men
of
character
if
the
wise
erred
not
says
george
herbert
it
would
go
hard
with
fools
yet
though
wise
men
may
learn
of
fools
by
avoiding
their
errors
fools
rarely
profit
by
the
example
which
wise
men
set
them
a
german
writer
has
said
that
it
is
a
miserable
temper
that
cares
only
to
discover
the
blemishes
in
the
character
of
great
men
or
great
periods
let
us
rather
judge
them
with
the
charity
of
bolingbroke
who
when
reminded
of
one
of
the
alleged
weaknesses
of
marlborough
observed
he
was
so
great
a
man
that
i
forgot
he
had
that
defect
admiration
of
great
men
living
or
dead
naturally
evokes
imitation
of
them
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
while
a
mere
youth
the
mind
of
themistocles
was
fired
by
the
great
deeds
of
his
contemporaries
and
he
longed
to
distinguish
himself
in
the
service
of
his
country
when
the
battle
of
marathon
had
been
fought
he
fell
into
a
state
of
melancholy
and
when
asked
by
his
friends
as
to
the
cause
he
replied
that
the
trophies
of
miltiades
would
not
suffer
him
to
sleep
a
few
years
later
we
find
him
at
the
head
of
the
athenian
army
defeating
the
persian
fleet
of
xerxes
in
the
battles
of
artemisium
and
salamis
his
country
gratefully
acknowledging
that
it
had
been
saved
through
his
wisdom
and
valour
it
is
related
of
thucydides
that
when
a
boy
he
burst
into
tears
on
hearing
herodotus
read
his
history
and
the
impression
made
upon
his
mind
was
such
as
to
determine
the
bent
of
his
own
genius
and
demosthenes
was
so
fired
on
one
occasion
by
the
eloquence
of
callistratus
that
the
ambition
was
roused
within
him
of
becoming
an
orator
himself
yet
demosthenes
was
physically
weak
had
a
feeble
voice
indistinct
articulation
and
shortness
of
breath
defects
which
he
was
only
enabled
to
overcome
by
diligent
study
and
invincible
determination
but
with
all
his
practice
he
never
became
a
ready
speaker
all
his
orations
especially
the
most
famous
of
them
exhibiting
indications
of
careful
elaboration
the
art
and
industry
of
the
orator
being
visible
in
almost
every
sentence
similar
illustrations
of
character
imitating
character
and
moulding
itself
by
the
style
and
manner
and
genius
of
great
men
are
to
be
found
pervading
all
history
warriors
statesmen
orators
patriots
poets
and
artists
all
have
been
more
or
less
unconsciously
nurtured
by
the
lives
and
actions
of
others
living
before
them
or
presented
for
their
imitation
great
men
have
evoked
the
admiration
of
kings
popes
and
emperors
francis
de
medicis
never
spoke
to
michael
angelo
without
uncovering
and
julius
iii
made
him
sit
by
his
side
while
a
dozen
cardinals
were
standing
charles
made
way
for
titian
and
one
day
when
the
brush
dropped
from
the
painter
hand
charles
stooped
and
picked
it
up
saying
you
deserve
to
be
served
by
an
emperor
leo
threatened
with
excommunication
whoever
should
print
and
sell
the
poems
of
ariosto
without
the
author
consent
the
same
pope
attended
the
deathbed
of
raphael
as
francis
did
that
of
leonardo
da
vinci
though
haydn
once
archly
observed
that
he
was
loved
and
esteemed
by
everybody
except
professors
of
music
yet
all
the
greatest
musicians
were
unusually
ready
to
recognise
each
other
greatness
haydn
himself
seems
to
have
been
entirely
free
from
petty
jealousy
his
admiration
of
the
famous
porpora
was
such
that
he
resolved
to
gain
admission
to
his
house
and
serve
him
as
a
valet
having
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
family
with
whom
porpora
lived
he
was
allowed
to
officiate
in
that
capacity
early
each
morning
he
took
care
to
brush
the
veteran
coat
polish
his
shoes
and
put
his
rusty
wig
in
order
at
first
porpora
growled
at
the
intruder
but
his
asperity
soon
softened
and
eventually
melted
into
affection
he
quickly
discovered
his
valet
genius
and
by
his
instructions
directed
it
into
the
line
in
which
haydn
eventually
acquired
so
much
distinction
haydn
himself
was
enthusiastic
in
his
admiration
of
handel
he
is
the
father
of
us
all
he
said
on
one
occasion
scarlatti
followed
handel
in
admiration
all
over
italy
and
when
his
name
was
mentioned
he
crossed
himself
in
token
of
veneration
mozart
recognition
of
the
great
composer
was
not
less
hearty
when
he
chooses
said
he
handel
strikes
like
the
thunderbolt
beethoven
hailed
him
as
the
monarch
of
the
musical
kingdom
when
beethoven
was
dying
one
of
his
friends
sent
him
a
present
of
handel
works
in
forty
volumes
they
were
brought
into
his
chamber
and
gazing
on
them
with
reanimated
eye
he
exclaimed
pointing
at
them
with
his
finger
there
there
is
the
truth
haydn
not
only
recognised
the
genius
of
the
great
men
who
had
passed
away
but
of
his
young
contemporaries
mozart
and
beethoven
small
men
may
be
envious
of
their
fellows
but
really
great
men
seek
out
and
love
each
other
of
mozart
haydn
wrote
i
only
wish
i
could
impress
on
every
friend
of
music
and
on
great
men
in
particular
the
same
depth
of
musical
sympathy
and
profound
appreciation
of
mozart
inimitable
music
that
i
myself
feel
and
enjoy
then
nations
would
vie
with
each
other
to
possess
such
a
jewel
within
their
frontiers
prague
ought
not
only
to
strive
to
retain
this
precious
man
but
also
to
remunerate
him
for
without
this
the
history
of
a
great
genius
is
sad
indeed
it
enrages
me
to
think
that
the
unparalleled
mozart
is
not
yet
engaged
by
some
imperial
or
royal
court
forgive
my
excitement
but
i
love
the
man
so
dearly
mozart
was
equally
generous
in
his
recognition
of
the
merits
of
haydn
sir
said
he
to
a
critic
speaking
of
the
latter
if
you
and
i
were
both
melted
down
together
we
should
not
furnish
materials
for
one
haydn
and
when
mozart
first
heard
beethoven
he
observed
listen
to
that
young
man
be
assured
that
he
will
yet
make
a
great
name
in
the
world
buffon
set
newton
above
all
other
philosophers
and
admired
him
so
highly
that
he
had
always
his
portrait
before
him
while
he
sat
at
work
so
schiller
looked
up
to
shakspeare
whom
he
studied
reverently
and
zealously
for
years
until
he
became
capable
of
comprehending
nature
at
and
then
his
admiration
became
even
more
ardent
than
before
pitt
was
canning
master
and
hero
whom
he
followed
and
admired
with
attachment
and
devotion
to
one
man
while
he
lived
said
canning
i
was
devoted
with
all
my
heart
and
all
my
soul
since
the
death
of
pitt
i
acknowledge
no
leader
my
political
allegiance
lies
buried
in
his
grave
a
french
physiologist
roux
was
occupied
one
day
in
lecturing
to
his
pupils
when
sir
charles
bell
whose
discoveries
were
even
better
known
and
more
highly
appreciated
abroad
than
at
home
strolled
into
his
the
professor
recognising
his
visitor
at
once
stopped
his
exposition
saying
messieurs
assez
pour
vous
avez
vu
sir
charles
bell
the
first
acquaintance
with
a
great
work
of
art
has
usually
proved
an
important
event
in
every
young
artist
life
when
correggio
first
gazed
on
raphael
cecilia
he
felt
within
himself
an
awakened
power
and
exclaimed
and
i
too
am
a
painter
so
constable
used
to
look
back
on
his
first
sight
of
claude
picture
of
as
forming
an
epoch
in
his
career
sir
george
beaumont
admiration
of
the
same
picture
was
such
that
he
always
took
it
with
him
in
his
carriage
when
he
travelled
from
home
the
examples
set
by
the
great
and
good
do
not
die
they
continue
to
live
and
speak
to
all
the
generations
that
succeed
them
it
was
very
impressively
observed
by
disraeli
in
the
house
of
commons
shortly
after
the
death
of
cobden
there
is
this
consolation
remaining
to
us
when
we
remember
our
unequalled
and
irreparable
losses
that
those
great
men
are
not
altogether
lost
to
us
that
their
words
will
often
be
quoted
in
this
house
that
their
examples
will
often
be
referred
to
and
appealed
to
and
that
even
their
expressions
will
form
part
of
our
discussions
and
debates
there
are
now
i
may
say
some
members
of
parliament
who
though
they
may
not
be
present
are
still
members
of
this
house
who
are
independent
of
dissolutions
of
the
caprices
of
constituencies
and
even
of
the
course
of
time
i
think
that
cobden
was
one
of
those
men
it
is
the
great
lesson
of
biography
to
teach
what
man
can
be
and
can
do
at
his
best
it
may
thus
give
each
man
renewed
strength
and
confidence
the
humblest
in
sight
of
even
the
greatest
may
admire
and
hope
and
take
courage
these
great
brothers
of
ours
in
blood
and
lineage
who
live
a
universal
life
still
speak
to
us
from
their
graves
and
beckon
us
on
in
the
paths
which
they
have
trod
their
example
is
still
with
us
to
guide
to
influence
and
to
direct
us
for
nobility
of
character
is
a
perpetual
bequest
living
from
age
to
age
and
constantly
tending
to
reproduce
its
like
the
sage
say
the
chinese
is
the
instructor
of
a
hundred
ages
when
the
manners
of
loo
are
heard
of
the
stupid
become
intelligent
and
the
wavering
determined
thus
the
acted
life
of
a
good
man
continues
to
be
a
gospel
of
freedom
and
emancipation
to
all
who
succeed
him
to
live
in
hearts

the

the

the

he

that
there
could

anything
more
servile
than
a

or
more
princely
than
a

when
the
emperor
severus
lay
on
his
deathbed
at

whither
he
had
been
borne
on
a
litter
from
the
foot
of
the
grampians
his
final
watchword
to
his
soldiers
was
laboremus
we
must
work
and
nothing
but
constant
toil
maintained
the
power
and
extended
the
authority
of
the
roman
generals
in
describing
the
earlier
social
condition
of
italy
when
the
ordinary
occupations
of

were
considered

civic
dignity
pliny
speaks
of
the
triumphant
generals
and
their
men
returning
contentedly
to
the
plough
in
those
days
the
lands
were
tilled
by
the
hands
even
of

the

it
was
only
after
slaves
became
extensively
employed
in
all
departments
of
industry
that
labour
came
to
be
regarded
as
dishonourable
and
servile
and
so
soon
as
indolence
and
luxury
became
the
characteristics
of
the
ruling
classes
of
rome
the
downfall
of
the
empire
sooner
or
later
was
inevitable
there
is
perhaps
no
tendency
of
our
nature
that
has
to
be
more
carefully
guarded
against
than
indolence
when
gurney
asked
an
intelligent
foreigner
who
had
travelled
over
the
greater
part
of
the
world
whether
he
had
observed
any
one
quality
which
more
than
another
could
be
regarded
as
a
universal
characteristic
of
our
species
his
answer
was
in
broken
english
me
tink
dat
all
men
love
lazy
it
is
characteristic
of
the
savage
as
of
the
despot
it
is
natural
to
men
to
endeavour
to
enjoy
the
products
of
labour
without
its
toils
indeed
so
universal
is
this
desire
that
james
mill
has
argued
that
it
was
to
prevent
its
indulgence
at
the
expense
of
society
at
large
that
the
expedient
of
government
was
originally
invented
indolence
is
equally
degrading
to
individuals
as
to
nations
sloth
never
made
its
mark
in
the
world
and
never
will
sloth
never
climbed
a
hill
nor
overcame
a
difficulty
that
it
could
avoid
indolence
always
failed
in
life
and
always
will
it
is
in
the
nature
of
things
that
it
should
not
succeed
in
anything
it
is

an
incumbrance
and
a

burton
says
a
great
deal
more
to
the
same
effect
the
burden
and
lesson
of
his
book
being
embodied
in
the
pregnant
sentence
with
which
it
winds
up
only
take
this
for
a
corollary
and
conclusion
as
thou
tenderest

of

observe
this
short
precept
give

idleness
be
not
solitary
be

the
indolent
however
are
not
wholly
indolent
though
the
body
may
shirk
labour
the
brain
is
not
idle
if
it
do
not
grow
corn
it
will
grow
thistles
which
will
be
found
springing
up
all
along
the
idle
man
course
in

the
ghosts
of
indolence
rise
up
in
the
dark
ever
staring

recreant
in
the
face
and
tormenting
him
the
gods
are
just
and
of
our
pleasant
vices
make
instrument
to
scourge
us
true
happiness
is
never
found
in
torpor
of
the
faculties
but
in
their
action
and
useful
employment
it
is
indolence
that
exhausts
not
action
in
which
there
is
life
health
and
pleasure
the
spirits
may
be
exhausted
and
wearied
by
employment
but
they
are
utterly
wasted
by
idleness
hense
a
wise
physician
was
accustomed
to
regard
occupation
as
one
of
his
most
valuable
remedial
measures
nothing
is
so
injurious
said
marshall
hall
as
unoccupied
time
an
archbishop
of
mayence
used
to
say
that
the
human
heart
is
like
a
millstone
if
you
put
wheat
under
it
it
grinds
the
wheat
into
flour
if
you
put
no
wheat
it
grinds
on
but
then
is
itself
it
wears
away
indolence
is
usually
full
of
excuses
and
the
sluggard
though
unwilling
to
work
is
often
an
active
sophist
there
is
a
lion
in
the
path
or
the

hard
to
climb

there
is
no
use

sophistries

an
excuser
sir
samuel
romilly
once
wrote
to
a
young
man
my
attack
upon
your
indolence
loss
of
time
was
most
serious
and
i
really
think
that
it
can
be
to
nothing
but
your
habitual
want
of
exertion
that
can
be
ascribed
your
using
such
curious
arguments
as
you
do
in
your
defence
your
theory
is
this
every
man
does
all
the
good
that
he
can
if
a
particular
individual
does
no
good
it
is
a
proof
that
he
is
incapable
of
doing
it
that
you
do
write
proves
that
you
ca
and
your
want
of
inclination
demonstrates
your
want
of
talents
what
an
admirable
system
and
what
beneficial
effects
would
it
be
attended
with
if
it
were
but
universally
received
it
has
been
truly
said
that
to
desire
to
possess
without
being
burdened
with
the
trouble
of
acquiring
is
as
much
a
sign
of
weakness
as
to
recognise
that
everything
worth
having
is
only
to
be
got
by
paying
its
price
is
the
prime
secret
of
practical
strength
even
leisure
can
not
be
enjoyed
unless
it
is
won
by
effort
if
it
have
not
been
earned
by
work
the
price
has
not
been
paid
for
it
there
must
be
work
before
and
work
behind
with
leisure
to
fall
back
upon
but
the
leisure
without
the
work
can
no
more
be
enjoyed
than
a
surfeit
life
must
needs
be
disgusting
alike
to
the
idle
rich
man
as
to
the
idle
poor
man
who
has
no
work
to
do

having
work

not

the

by

however
richly
he
may

can
not

feel
that
he
is
in
duty
bound
to
contribute
his
quota
of
endeavour
towards
the
general
wellbeing
in
which

he

being

by
the

of

without
making
some

an

sitting
down
to
and
enjoying
a
feast
and
then
going
away
without
paying
his
share
of
the
reckoning
to
be
idle
and
useless
is
neither
an
honour
nor
a
privilege

men
of

will
feel
such
a

to

incompatible
with
real
honour
and
true
dignity
i
do
believe
said
lord
stanley
earl
of
derby
at
glasgow
that
an
unemployed
man
however
amiable
and
otherwise
respectable
ever
was
or
ever
can
be
really
happy
as
work
is
our
life
show
me
what
you
can
do
and
i
will
show
you
what
you
are
i
have
spoken
of
love
of
work
as
the
best
preventive
of
merely
low
and
vicious
tastes
i
will
go
further
and
say
that
it
is
the
best
preservative
against
petty
anxieties
and
the
annoyances
that
arise
out
of
indulged
men
have
thought
before
now
that
they
could
take
refuge
from
trouble
and
vexation
by
sheltering
themselves
as
it
were
in
a
world
of
their
own
the
experiment
has
often
been
tried
and
always
with
one
result
you
can
not
escape
from
anxiety
and
labour
it
is
the
destiny
of
humanity
those
who
shirk
from
facing
trouble
find
that
trouble
comes
to
them
the
indolent
may
contrive
that
he
shall
have
less
than
his
share
of
the
world
work
to
do
but
nature
proportioning
the
instinct
to
the
work
contrives
that
the
little
shall
be
much
and
hard
to
him
the
man
who
has
only
himself
to
please
finds
sooner
or
later
and
probably
sooner
than
later
that
he
has
got
a
very
hard
master
and
the
excessive
weakness
which
shrinks
from
responsibility
has
its
own
punishment
too
for
where
great
interests
are
excluded
little
matters
become
great
and
the
same
wear
and
tear
of
mind
that
might
have
been
at
least
usefully
and
healthfully
expended
on
the
real
business
of
life
is
often
wasted
in
petty
and
imaginary
vexations
such
as
breed
and
multiply
in
the
unoccupied
brain
even
on
the
lowest
ground
that
of
personal
enjoyment
constant
useful
occupation
is
necessary
he
who
labours
not
can
not
enjoy
the
reward
of
labour
we
sleep
sound
said
sir
walter
scott
and
our
waking
hours
are
happy
when
they
are
employed
and
a
little
sense
of
toil
is
necessary
to
the
enjoyment
of
leisure
even
when
earned
by
study
and
sanctioned
by
the
discharge
of
duty
it
is
true
there
are
men
who
die
of
overwork
but
many
more
die
of
selfishness
indulgence
and
idleness
where
men
break
down
by
overwork
it
is
most
commonly
from
want
of
duly
ordering
their
lives
and
neglect
of
the
ordinary
conditions
of
physical
health
lord
stanley
was
probably
right
when
he
said
in
his
address
to
the
glasgow
students
above
mentioned
that
he
doubted
whether
hard
work
steadily
and
regularly
carried
on
ever
yet
hurt
anybody
then
again
length
of
years
is
no
proper
test
of
length
of
life
a
man
life
is
to
be
measured
by
what
he
does
in
it
and
what
he
feels
in
it
the
more
useful
work
the
man
does
and
the
more
he
thinks
and
feels
the
more
he
really
lives
the
idle
useless
man
no
matter
to
what
extent
his
life
may
be
prolonged
merely
vegetates
the
early
teachers
of
christianity
ennobled
the
lot
of
toil
by
their
example
he
that
will
not
work
said
saint
paul
neither
shall
he
eat
and
he
glorified
himself
in
that
he
had
laboured
with
his
hands
and
had
not
been
chargeable
to
any
man
when
boniface
landed
in
britain
he
came
with
a
gospel
in
one
hand
and
a
carpenter
rule
in
the
other
and
from
england
he
afterwards
passed
over
into
germany
carrying
thither
the
art
of
building
luther
also
in
the
midst
of
a
multitude
of
other
employments
worked
diligently
for
a
living
earning
his
bread
by
gardening
building
turning
and
even
clockmaking
it
was
characteristic
of
napoleon
when
visiting
a
work
of
mechanical
excellence
to
pay
great
respect
to
the
inventor
and
on
taking
his
leave
to
salute
him
with
a
low
bow
once
at
helena
when
walking
with
balcombe
some
servants
came
along
carrying
a
load
the
lady
in
an
angry
tone
ordered
them
out
of
the
way
on
which
napoleon
interposed
saying
respect
the
burden
madam
even
the
drudgery
of
the
humblest
labourer
contributes
towards
the
general
wellbeing
of
society
and
it
was
a
wise
saying
of
a
chinese
emperor
that
if
there
was
a
man
who
did
not
work
or
a
woman
that
was
idle
somebody
must
suffer
cold
or
hunger
in
the
empire
the
habit
of
constant
useful
occupation
is
as
essential
for
the
happiness
and
wellbeing
of
woman
as
of
man
without
it
women
are
apt
to
sink
into

of

ennui
and
uselessness

which

more

to
all

the
best
relief
is

engaged
in
with
interest
and
diligence
work
then
constantly
and
diligently
at
something
or
other
for
idleness
is
the
devil
snare
for
small
and
great
as
your
grandfather
says
and
he
says
true
constant
useful
occupation
is
thus
wholesome
not

for

for

mind
while
the
slothful
man
drags
himself
indolently
through
life
and
the
better
part
of
his
nature
sleeps
a
deep
sleep
if
not
morally
and
spiritually
dead
the
energetic
man
is
a
source
of
activity
and
enjoyment
to
all
who
come
within
reach
of
his
influence
even
any
ordinary
drudgery
is
better
than
idleness
fuller
says
of
sir
francis
drake
who
was
early
sent
to
sea
and
kept
close
to
his
work
by
his
master
that
such
pains
and
patience
in
his
youth
knit
the
joints
of
his
soul
and
made
them
more
solid
and
compact
schiller
used
to
say
that
he
considered
it
a
great
advantage
to
be
employed
in
the
discharge
of
some
daily
mechanical
duty
some
regular
routine
of
work
that
rendered
steady
application
necessary
thousands
can
bear
testimony
to
the
truth
of
the
saying
of
greuze
the
french
painter
that
work
employment
useful
occupation
is
one
of
the
great
secrets
of
happiness
casaubon
was
once
induced
by
the
entreaties
of
his
friends
to
take
a
few
days
entire
rest
but
he
returned
to
his
work
with
the
remark
that
it
was
easier
to
bear
illness
doing
something
than
doing
nothing
when
charles
lamb
was
released
for
life
from
his
daily
drudgery
of
at
the
india
office
he
felt
himself
the
happiest
of
men
i
would
not
go
back
to
my
prison
he
said
to
a
friend
ten
years
longer
for
ten
thousand
pounds
he
also
wrote
in
the
same
ecstatic
mood
to
bernard
barton
i
have
scarce
steadiness
of
head
to
compose
a
letter
he
said
i
am
free
free
as
air
i
will
live
another
fifty
years
would
i
could
sell
you
some
of
my
leisure
positively
the
best
thing
a
man
can
do
is
nothing
and
next
to
that
perhaps
good
works
two
years
two
long
and
tedious
years
passed
and
charles
lamb
feelings
had
undergone
an
entire
change
he
now
discovered
that
official
even
humdrum
work
the
appointed
round
the
daily
task
had
been
good
for
him
though
he
knew
it
not
time
had
formerly
been
his
friend
it
had
now
become
his
enemy
to
bernard
barton
he
again
wrote
i
assure
you
no
work
is
worse
than
overwork
the
mind
preys
on
itself
the
most
unwholesome
of
food
i
have
ceased
to
care
for
almost
anything
never
did
the
waters
of
heaven
pour
down
upon
a
forlorner
head
what
i
can
do
and
overdo
is
to
walk
i
am
a
sanguinary
murderer
of
time
but
the
oracle
is
silent
no
man
could
be
more
sensible
of
the
practical
importance
of
industry
than
sir
walter
scott
who
was
himself
one
of
the
most
laborious
and
indefatigable
of
men
indeed
lockhart
says
of
him
that
taking
all
ages
and
countries
together
the
rare
example
of
indefatigable
energy
in
union
with
serene
of
mind
and
manner
such
as
scott
must
be
sought
for
in
the
roll
of
great
sovereigns
or
great
captains
rather
than
in
that
of
literary
genius
scott
himself
was
most
anxious
to
impress
upon
the
minds
of
his
own
children
the
importance
of
industry
as
a
means
of
usefulness
and
happiness
in
the
world
to
his
son
charles
when
at
school
he
wrote
i
can
not
too
much
impress
upon
your
mind
that
labour
is
the
condition
which
god
has
imposed
on
us
in
every
station
of
life
there
is
nothing
worth
having
that
can
be
had
without
it
from
the
bread
which
the
peasant
wins
with
the
sweat
of
his
brow
to
the
sports
by
which
the
rich
man
must
get
rid
of
his
ennui
as
for
knowledge
it
can
no
more
be
planted
in
the
human
mind
without
labour
than
a
field
of
wheat
can
be
produced
without
the
previous
use
of
the
plough
there
is
indeed
this
great
difference
that
chance
or
circumstances
may
so
cause
it
that
another
shall
reap
what
the
farmer
sows
but
no
man
can
be
deprived
whether
by
accident
or
misfortune
of
the
fruits
of
his
own
studies
and
the
liberal
and
extended
acquisitions
of
knowledge
which
he
makes
are
all
for
his
own
use
labour
therefore
my
dear
boy
and
improve
the
time
in
youth
our
steps
are
light
and
our
minds
are
ductile
and
knowledge
is
easily
laid
up
but
if
we
neglect
our
spring
our
summers
will
be
useless
and
contemptible
our
harvest
will
be
chaff
and
the
winter
of
our
old
age
unrespected
and
desolate
southey
was
as
laborious
a
worker
as
scott
indeed
work
might
almost
be
said
to
form
part
of
his
religion
he
was
only
nineteen
when
he
wrote
these
words
nineteen
years
certainly
a
fourth
part
of
my
life
perhaps
how
great
a
part
and
yet
i
have
been
of
no
service
to
society
the
clown
who
scares
crows
for
twopence
a
day
is
a
more
useful
man
he
preserves
the
bread
which
i
eat
in
idleness
and
yet
southey
had
not
been
idle
as
a
boy
on
the
contrary
he
had
been
a
most
diligent
student
he
had
not
only
read
largely
in
english
literature
but
was
well
acquainted
through
translations
with
tasso
ariosto
homer
and
ovid
he
felt
however
as
if
his
life
had
been
purposeless
and
he
determined
to
do
something
he
began
and
from
that
time
forward
he
pursued
an
unremitting
career
of
literary
labour
down
to
the
close
of
his
life
daily
progressing
in
learning
to
use
his
own
words
not
so
learned
as
he
is
poor
not
so
poor
as
proud
not
so
proud
as
happy
the
maxims
of
men
often
reveal
their
character
that
of
sir
walter
scott
was
never
to
be
doing
nothing
robertson
the
historian
as
early
as
his
fifteenth
year
adopted
the
maxim
of
vita
sine
literis
mors
est
without
learning
is
death
voltaire
motto
was
toujours
au
travail
at
work
the
favourite
maxim
of
lacepede
the
naturalist
was
vivre
veiller
live
is
to
observe
it
was
also
the
maxim
of
pliny
when
bossuet
was
at
college
he
was
so
distinguished
by
his
ardour
in
study
that
his
fellow
students
playing
upon
his
name
designated
him
as
aratro
ox
used
to
the
plough
the
name
of
a
struggle
which
the
swedish
poet
sjoberg
assumed
as
frederik
von
hardenberg
assumed
that
of
described
the
aspirations
and
the
labours
of
both
these
men
of
genius
we
have
spoken
of
work
as
a
discipline
it
is
also
an
educator
of
character
even
work
that
produces
no
results
because
it
is
work
is
better
than
torpor
inasmuch
as
it
educates
faculty
and
is
thus
preparatory
to
successful
work
the
habit
of
working
teaches
method
it
compels
economy
of
time
and
the
disposition
of
it
with
judicious
forethought
and
when
the
art
of
packing
life
with
useful
occupations
is
once
acquired
by
practice
every
minute
will
be
turned
to
account
and
leisure
when
it
comes
will
be
enjoyed
with
all
the
greater
zest
coleridge
has
truly
observed
that
if
the
idle
are
described
as
killing
time
the
methodical
man
may
be
justly
said
to
call
it
into
life
and
moral
being
while
he
makes
it
the
distinct
object
not
only
of
the
consciousness
but
of
the
conscience
he
organizes
the
hours
and
gives
them
a
soul
and
by
that
the
very
essence
of
which
is
to
fleet
and
to
have
been
he
communicates
an
imperishable
and
spiritual
nature
of
the
good
and
faithful
servant
whose
energies
thus
directed
are
thus
methodized
it
is
less
truly
affirmed
that
he
lives
in
time
than
that
time
lives
in
him
his
days
and
months
and
years
as
the
stops
and
punctual
marks
in
the
record
of
duties
performed
will
survive
the
wreck
of
worlds
and
remain
extant
when
time
itself
shall
be
no
more
it
is
because
application
to
business
teaches
method
most
effectually
that
it
is
so
useful
as
an
educator
of
character
the
highest
working
qualities
are
best
trained
by
active
and
sympathetic
contact
with
others
in
the
affairs
of
daily
life
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
business
relate
to
the
management
of
a
household
or
of
a
nation
indeed
as
we
have
endeavoured
to
show
in
a
preceding
chapter
the
able
housewife
must
necessarily
be
an
efficient
woman
of
business
she
must
regulate
and
control
the
details
of
her
home
keep
her
expenditure
within
her
means
arrange
everything
according
to
plan
and
system
and
wisely
manage
and
govern
those
subject
to
her
rule
efficient
domestic
management
implies
industry
application
method
moral
discipline
forethought
prudence
practical
ability
insight
into
character
and
power
of
organization
all
of
which
are
required
in
the
efficient
management
of
business
of
whatever
sort
business
qualities
have
indeed
a
very
large
field
of
action
they
mean
aptitude
for
affairs
competency
to
deal
successfully
with
the
practical
work
of
life
whether
the
spur
of
action
lie
in
domestic
management
in
the
conduct
of
a
profession
in
trade
or
commerce
in
social
organization
or
in
political
government
and
the
training
which
gives
efficiency
in
dealing
with
these
various
affairs
is
of
all
others
the
most
useful
in
practical
life
moreover
it
is
the
best
discipline
of
character
for
it
involves
the
exercise
of
diligence
attention
judgment
tact
knowledge
of
and
sympathy
with
others
such
a
discipline
is
far
more
productive
of
happiness
as
well
as
useful
efficiency
in
life
than
any
amount
of
literary
culture
or
meditative
seclusion
for
in
the
long
run
it
will
usually
be
found
that
practical
ability
carries
it
over
intellect
and
temper
and
habits
over
talent
it
must
however
he
added
that
this
is
a
kind
of
culture
that
can
only
be
acquired
by
diligent
observation
and
carefully
improved
experience
to
be
a
good
blacksmith
said
general
trochu
in
a
recent
publication
one
must
have
forged
all
his
life
to
be
a
good
administrator
one
should
have
passed
his
whole
life
in
the
study
and
practice
of
business
it
was
characteristic
of
sir
walter
scott
to
entertain
the
highest
respect
for
able
men
of
business
and
he
professed
that
he
did
not
consider
any
amount
of
literary
distinction
as
entitled
to
be
spoken
of
in
the
same
breath
with
a
mastery
in
the
higher
departments
of
practical
life
least
of
all
with
a
captain
the
great
commander
leaves
nothing
to
chance
but
provides
for
every
contingency
he
condescends
to
apparently
trivial
details
thus
when
wellington
was
at
the
head
of
his
army
in
spain
he
directed
the
precise
manner
in
which
the
soldiers
were
to
cook
their
provisions
when
in
india
he
specified
the
exact
speed
at
which
the
bullocks
were
to
be
driven
every
detail
in
equipment
was
carefully
arranged
beforehand
and
thus
not
only
was
efficiency
secured
but
the
devotion
of
his
men
and
their
boundless
confidence
in
his
command
like
other
great
captains
wellington
had
an
almost
boundless
capacity
for
work
he
drew
up
the
heads
of
a
dublin
police
bill
still
the
secretary
for
ireland
when
tossing
off
the
mouth
of
the
mondego
with
junot
and
the
french
army
waiting
for
him
on
the
shore
so
caesar
another
of
the
greatest
commanders
is
said
to
have
written
an
essay
on
latin
rhetoric
while
crossing
the
alps
at
the
head
of
his
army
and
wallenstein
when
at
the
head
of
men
and
in
the
midst
of
a
campaign
with
the
enemy
before
him
dictated
from
headquarters
the
medical
treatment
of
his
washington
also
was
an
indefatigable
man
of
business
from
his
boyhood
he
diligently
trained
himself
in
habits
of
application
of
study
and
of
methodical
work
his
manuscript
which
are
still
preserved
show
that
as
early
as
the
age
of
thirteen
he
occupied
himself
voluntarily
in
copying
out
such
things
as
forms
of
receipts
notes
of
hand
bills
of
exchange
bonds
indentures
leases
and
other
dry
documents
all
written
out
with
great
care
and
the
habits
which
he
thus
early
acquired
were
in
a
great
measure
the
foundation
of
those
admirable
business
qualities
which
he
afterwards
so
successfully
brought
to
bear
in
the
affairs
of
government
the
man
or
woman
who
achieves
success
in
the
management
of
any
great
affair
of
business
is
entitled
to
honour
it
may
be
to
as
much
as
the
artist
who
paints
a
picture
or
the
author
who
writes
a
book
or
the
soldier
who
wins
a
battle
their
success
may
have
been
gained
in
the
face
of
as
great
difficulties
and
after
as
great
struggles
and
where
they
have
won
their
battle
it
is
at
least
a
peaceful
one
and
there
is
no
blood
on
their
hands
the
idea
has
been
entertained
by
some
that
business
habits
are
incompatible
with
genius
in
the
life
of
richard
lovell
edgeworth
it
is
observed
of
a
bicknell
a
respectable
but
ordinary
man
of
whom
little
is
known
but
that
he
married
sabrina
sidney
the
eleve
of
thomas
day
author
of
and
merton
that
he
had
some
of
the
too
usual
faults
of
a
man
of
genius
he
detested
the
drudgery
of
business
but
there
can
not
be
a
greater
mistake
the
greatest
geniuses
have
without
exception
been
the
greatest
workers
even
to
the
extent
of
drudgery
they
have
not
only
worked
harder
than
ordinary
men
but
brought
to
their
work
higher
faculties
and
a
more
ardent
spirit
nothing
great
and
durable
was
ever
improvised
it
is
only
by
noble
patience
and
noble
labour
that
the
masterpieces
of
genius
have
been
achieved
power
belongs
only
to
the
workers
the
idlers
are
always
powerless
it
is
the
laborious
and
painstaking
men
who
are
the
rulers
of
the
world
there
has
not
been
a
statesman
of
eminence
but
was
a
man
of
industry
it
is
by
toil
said
even
louis
that
kings
govern
when
clarendon
described
hampden
he
spoke
of
him
as
of
an
industry
and
vigilance
not
to
be
tired
out
or
wearied
by
the
most
laborious
and
of
parts
not
to
be
imposed
on
by
the
most
subtle
and
sharp
and
of
a
personal
courage
equal
to
his
best
parts
while
in
the
midst
of
his
laborious
though
duties
hampden
on
one
occasion
wrote
to
his
mother
my
lyfe
is
nothing
but
toyle
and
hath
been
for
many
yeares
nowe
to
the
commonwealth
nowe
to
the
kinge
not
so
much
tyme
left
as
to
doe
my
dutye
to
my
deare
parents
nor
to
sende
to
them
indeed
all
the
statesmen
of
the
commonwealth
were
great
toilers
and
clarendon
himself
whether
in
office
or
out
of
it
was
a
man
of
indefatigable
application
and
industry
the
same
energetic
vitality
as
displayed
in
the
power
of
working
has
distinguished
all
the
eminent
men
in
our
own
as
well
as
in
past
times
during
the
law
movement
cobden
writing
to
a
friend
described
himself
as
working
like
a
horse
with
not
a
moment
to
spare
lord
brougham
was
a
remarkable
instance
of
the
indefatigably
active
and
laborious
man
and
it
might
be
said
of
lord
palmerston
that
he
worked
harder
for
success
in
his
extreme
old
age
than
he
had
ever
done
in
the
prime
of
his
manhood
preserving
his
working
faculty
his
and
bonhommie
unimpaired
to
the
end
he
himself
was
accustomed
to
say
that
being
in
office
and
consequently
full
of
work
was
good
for
his
health
it
rescued
him
from
ennui
helvetius
even
held
that
it
is
man
sense
of
ennui
that
is
the
chief
cause
of
his
superiority
over
the
brute
that
it
is
the
necessity
which
he
feels
for
escaping
from
its
intolerable
suffering
that
forces
him
to
employ
himself
actively
and
is
hence
the
great
stimulus
to
human
progress
indeed
this
living
principle
of
constant
work
of
abundant
occupation
of
practical
contact
with
men
in
the
affairs
of
life
has
in
all
times
been
the
best
ripener
of
the
energetic
vitality
of
strong
natures
business
habits
cultivated
and
disciplined
are
found
alike
useful
in
every
pursuit
whether
in
politics
literature
science
or
art
thus
a
great
deal
of
the
best
literary
work
has
been
done
by
men
systematically
trained
in
business
pursuits
the
same
industry
application
economy
of
time
and
labour
which
have
rendered
them
useful
in
the
one
sphere
of
employment
have
been
found
equally
available
in
the
other
most
of
the
early
english
writers
were
men
of
affairs
trained
to
business
for
no
literary
class
as
yet
existed
excepting

the

poetry
was
first
a
soldier
and
afterwards
a
comptroller
of

customs
the
office
was
no
sinecure
either
for
he
had
to
write
up
all
the
records
with
his
own
hand
and
when
he
had
done
his
reckonings
at

he
returned
with
delight
to
his
favourite
studies
at

poring
over
his
books
until
his
eyes
were
dazed
and
dull
the
great
writers
in
the
reign
of
elizabeth
during
which
there
was
such
a
development
of
robust
life
in
england
were
not
literary
men
according
to
the
modern
acceptation
of
the

men
of
action

parish
shakspeare
was
the
manager
of
a
theatre
in
which
he
was
himself
but
an
indifferent
actor
and
he
seems
to
have
been
even
more
careful
of
his
money
investments
than
he
was
of
his
intellectual
offspring
yet
these
all
men
of
active
business
habits
are
among
the
greatest
writers
of
any
age
the
period
of
elizabeth
and
james
standing
out
in
the
history
of
england
as
the
era
of
its
greatest
literary
activity
and
splendour
in
the
reign
of
charles
cowley
held
various
offices
of
trust
and
confidence
he
acted
as
private
secretary
to
several
of
the
royalist
leaders
and
was
afterwards
engaged
as
private
secretary
to
the
queen
in
ciphering
and
deciphering
the
correspondence
which
passed
between
her
and
charles
the
work
occupying
all
his
days
and
often
his
nights
during
several
years
and
while
cowley
was
thus
employed
in
the
royal
cause
milton
was
employed
by
the
commonwealth
of
which
he
was
the
latin
secretary
and
afterwards
secretary
to
the

protector
yet
in
the
earlier
part
of
his
life
milton
was
occupied
in
the
humble
vocation
of
a
teacher
johnson
says
that
in
his
school
as
in
everything
else
which
he
undertook
he
laboured
with
great
diligence
there
is
no
reason
for
doubting
it
was
after
the
restoration
when
his
official
employment
ceased
that
milton
entered
upon
the
principal
literary
work
of
his
life
but
before
he
undertook
the
writing
of
his
great
epic
he
deemed
it
indispensable
that
to
industrious
and
select
reading
he
should
add
steady
observation
and
insight
into
all
seemly
and
generous
arts
and
affairs

indeed

of

instead
of
unfitting
a

for
scientific
or
literary
pursuits
are
often
the
best
training
for
them
voltaire
insisted
with
truth
that
the
real
spirit
of
business
and
literature
are
the
same
the
perfection
of
each
being
the
union
of
energy
and
thoughtfulness
of
cultivated
intelligence
and
practical
wisdom
of
the
active
and
contemplative
essence
a
union
commended
by
lord
bacon
as
the
concentrated
excellence
of
man
nature
it
has
been
said
that
even
the
man
of
genius
can
write
nothing
worth
reading
in
relation
to
human
affairs
unless
he
has
been
in
some
way
or
other
connected
with
the
serious
everyday
business
of
life
hence
it
has
happened
that
many
of
the
best
books
extant
have
been
written
by
men
of
business
with
whom
literature
was
a
pastime
rather
than
a
profession
gifford
the
editor
of
the

knew
the
drudgery
of
writing
for
a
living
once
observed
that
a
single
hour
of
composition
won
from
the
business
of
the
day
is
worth
more
than
the
whole
day
toil
of
him
who
works
at
the
trade
of
literature
in
the
one
case
the
spirit
comes
joyfully
to
refresh
itself
like
a
hart
to
the
waterbrooks
in
the
other
it
pursues
its
miserable
way
panting
and
jaded
with
the
dogs
and
hunger
of
necessity

during

time
he
wrote

the
greater
number
of

as
to
enable

probably

anonymously
because
he
apprehended
that
if
known
it
might
compromise
his
professional
position
for
it
is
by
no
means
an
uncommon
prejudice
still
prevalent
amongst
city
men
that
a
person
who
has
written
a
book
and
still
more
one
who
has
written
a

is
good
for
nothing
in

sharon

that
they
were
selected
to
fill
the
important
and
lucrative
post
of
solicitors
to
the
admiralty
and
they
filled
it
admirably
it
was
while
the
late
broderip
the
barrister
was
acting
as
a
london
police
magistrate
that
he
was
attracted
to
the
study
of
natural
history
in
which
he
occupied
the
greater
part
of
his
leisure
he
wrote
the
principal
articles
on
the
subject
for
the
cyclopaedia
besides
several
separate
works
of
great
merit

particularly
the
recreations
and
from
the
notebook
of
a
naturalist
it
is
recorded
of
him
that
though
he
devoted
so
much
of
his
time
to
the
production
of
his
works
as
well
as
to
the
zoological
society
and
their
admirable
establishment
in

of
which
he
was
one
of
the
founders
his
studies
never
interfered
with
the
real
business
of
his
life
nor
is
it
known
that
a
single
question
was
ever
raised
upon
his
conduct
or
his
decisions
and
while
broderip
devoted
himself
to
natural
history
the
late
lord
chief
baron
pollock
devoted
his
leisure
to
natural
science
recreating
himself
in
the
practice
of
photography
and

study
of
mathematics
in
both
of
which

the

besides
various
important
works
on
ethics

economy

nor
on
the

have
men
of

themselves
inefficient

and

it
freedom
and
vigour
of
action
all
of
which
are
equally
requisite
in
the
successful
conduct
of
business
thus
in
young
men
education
and
scholarship
usually
indicate
steadiness
of
character
for
they
imply
continuous
attention
diligence
and
the
ability
and
energy
necessary
to
master
knowledge
and
such
persons
will
also
usually
be
found
possessed
of
more
than
average
promptitude

montaigne
has
said
of
true
philosophers
that
if
they
were
great
in
science
they
were
yet
much
greater
in
action
and
whenever
they
have
been
put
upon
the
proof
they
have
been
seen
to
fly
to
so
high
a
pitch
as
made
it
very
well
appear
their
souls
were
strangely
elevated
and
enriched
with
the
knowledge
of
things
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
too
exclusive
a
devotion
to
imaginative
and
philosophical
literature
especially
if
prolonged
in
life
until
the
habits
become
formed
does
to
a
great
extent
incapacitate
a
man
for
the
business
of
practical
life
speculative
ability
is
one
thing
and
practical
ability
another
and
the
man
who
in
his
study
or
with
his
pen
in
hand
shows
himself
capable
of
forming
large
views
of
life
and
policy
may
in
the
outer
world
be
found
altogether
unfitted
for
carrying
them
into
practical
effect
speculative
ability
depends
on
vigorous
thinking
practical
ability
on
vigorous
acting
and
the
two
qualities
are
usually
found
combined
in
very
unequal
proportions
the
speculative
man
is
prone
to
indecision
he
sees
all
the
sides
of
a
question
and
his
action
becomes
suspended
in
nicely
weighing
the
pros
and
cons
which
are
often
found
pretty
nearly
to
balance
each
other
whereas
the
practical
man
overleaps
logical
preliminaries
arrives
at
certain
definite
convictions
and
proceeds
forthwith
to
carry
his
policy
into
action
yet
there
have
been
many
great
men
of
science
who
have
proved
efficient
men
of
business
we
do
not
learn
that
sir
isaac
newton
made
a
worse
master
of
the
mint
because
he
was
the
greatest
of
philosophers
nor
were
there
any
complaints
as
to
the
efficiency
of
sir
john
herschel
who
held
the
same
office
the
brothers
humboldt
were
alike
capable
men
in
all
that
they
undertook
whether
it
was
literature
philosophy
mining
philology
diplomacy
or
statesmanship
niebuhr
the
historian
was
distinguished
for
his
energy
and
success
as
a
man
of
business
he
proved
so
efficient
as
secretary
and
accountant
to
the
african
consulate
to
which
he
had
been
appointed
by
the
danish
government
that
he
was
afterwards
selected
as
one
of
the
commissioners
to
manage
the
national
finances
and
he
quitted
that
office
to
undertake
the
joint
directorship
of
a
bank
at
berlin
it
was
in
the
midst
of
his
business
occupations
that
he
found
time
to
study
roman
history
to
master
the
arabic
russian
and
other
sclavonic
languages
and
to
build
up
the
great
reputation
as
an
author
by
which
he
is
now
chiefly
remembered
having
regard
to
the
views
professed
by
the
first
napoleon
as
to
men
of
science
it
was
to
have
been
expected
that
he
would
endeavour
to
strengthen
his
administration
by
calling
them
to
his
aid
some
of
his
appointments
proved
failures
while
others
were
completely
successful
thus
laplace
was
made
minister
of
the
interior
but
he
had
no
sooner
been
appointed
than
it
was
seen
that
a
mistake
had
been
made
napoleon
afterwards
said
of
him
that
laplace
looked
at
no
question
in
its
true
point
of
view
he
was
always
searching
after
subtleties
all
his
ideas
were
problems
and
he
carried
the
spirit
of
the
infinitesimal
calculus
into
the
management
of
business
but
laplace
habits
had
been
formed
in
the
study
and
he
was
too
old
to
adapt
them
to
the
purposes
of
practical
life
with
darn
it
was
different
but
darn
had
the
advantage
of
some
practical
training
in
business
having
served
as
an
intendant
of
the
army
in
switzerland
under
massena
during
which
he
also
distinguished
himself
as
an
author
when
napoleon
proposed
to
appoint
him
a
councillor
of
state
and
intendant
of
the
imperial
household
darn
hesitated
to
accept
the
office
i
have
passed
the
greater
part
of
my
life
he
said
among
books
and
have
not
had
time
to
learn
the
functions
of
a
courtier
of
courtiers
replied
napoleon
i
have
plenty
about
me
they
will
never
fail
but
i
want
a
minister
at
once
enlightened
firm
and
vigilant
and
it
is
for
these
qualities
that
i
have
selected
you
darn
complied
with
the
emperor
wishes
and
eventually
became
his
prime
minister
proving
thoroughly
efficient
in
that
capacity
and
remaining
the
same
modest
honourable
and
disinterested
man
that
he
had
ever
been
through
life
men
of
trained
working
faculty
so
contract
the
habit
of
labour
that
idleness
becomes
intolerable
to
them
and
when
driven
by
circumstances
from
their
own
special
line
of
occupation
they
find
refuge
in
other
pursuits
the
diligent
man
is
quick
to
find
employment
for
his
leisure
and
he
is
able
to
make
leisure
when
the
idle
man
finds
none
he
hath
no
leisure
says
george
herbert
who
useth
it
not
the
most
active
or
busy
man
that
hath
been
or
can
be
says
bacon
hath
no
question
many
vacant
times
of
leisure
while
he
expecteth
the
tides
and
returns
of
business
except
he
be
either
tedious
and
of
no
despatch
or
lightly
and
unworthily
ambitious
to
meddle
with
things
that
may
be
better
done
by
others
thus
many
great
things
have
been
done
during
such
vacant
times
of
leisure
by
men
to
whom
industry
had
become
a
second
nature
and
who
found
it
easier
to
work
than
to
be
idle
even
hobbies
are
useful
as
educators
of
the
working
faculty
hobbies
evoke
industry
of
a
certain
kind
and
at
least
provide
agreeable
occupation
not
such
hobbies
as
that
of
domitian
who
occupied
himself
in
catching
flies
the
hobbies
of
the
king
of
macedon
who
made
lanthorns
and
of
the
king
of
france
who
made
locks
were
of
a
more
respectable
order
even
a
routine
mechanical
employment
is
felt
to
be
a
relief
by
minds
acting
under
it
is
an
intermission
of
labour
a
rest
a
relaxation
the
pleasure
consisting
in
the
work
itself
rather
than
in
the
result
but
the
best
of
hobbies
are
intellectual
ones
thus
men
of
active
mind
retire
from
their
daily
business
to
find
recreation
in
other
pursuits
some
in
science
some
in
art
and
the
greater
number
in
literature
such
recreations
are
among
the
best
preservatives
against
selfishness
and
vulgar
worldliness
we
believe
it
was
lord
brougham
who
said
blessed
is
the
man
that
hath
a
hobby
and
in
the
abundant
versatility
of
his
nature
he
himself
had
many
ranging
from
literature
to
optics
from
history
and
biography
to
social
science
lord
brougham
is
even
said
to
have
written
a
novel
and
the
remarkable
story
of
the
in
the
bell
which
appeared
many
years
ago
in
is
reputed
to
have
been
from
his
pen
intellectual
hobbies
however
must
not
be
ridden
too
hard
else
instead
of
recreating
refreshing
and
invigorating
a
man
nature
they
may
only
have
the
effect
of
sending
him
back
to
his
business
exhausted
enervated
and
depressed
many
laborious
statesmen
besides
lord
brougham
have
occupied
their
leisure
or
consoled
themselves
in
retirement
from
office
by
the
composition
of
works
which
have
become
part
of
the
standard
literature
of
the
world
thus
commentaries
still
survive
as
a
classic
the
perspicuous
and
forcible
style
in
which
they
are
written
placing
him
in
the
same
rank
with
xenophon
who
also
successfully
combined
the
pursuit
of
letters
with
the
business
of
active
life
when
the
great
sully
was
disgraced
as
a
minister
and
driven
into
retirement
he
occupied
his
leisure
in
writing
out
his
in
anticipation
of
the
judgment
of
posterity
upon
his
career
as
a
statesman
besides
these
he
also
composed
part
of
a
romance
after
the
manner
of
the
scuderi
school
the
manuscript
of
which
was
found
amongst
his
papers
at
his
death
turgot
found
a
solace
for
the
loss
of
office
from
which
he
had
been
driven
by
the
intrigues
of
his
enemies
in
the
study
of
physical
science
he
also
reverted
to
his
early
taste
for
classical
literature
during
his
long
journeys
and
at
nights
when
tortured
by
the
gout
he
amused
himself
by
making
latin
verses
though
the
only
line
of
his
that
has
been
preserved
was
that
intended
to
designate
the
portrait
of
benjamin
franklin
eripuit
caelo
fulmen
sceptrumque
tyrannis
among
more
recent
french
statesmen
with
whom
however
literature
has
been
their
profession
as
much
as
politics
may
be
mentioned
de
tocqueville
thiers
guizot
and
lamartine
while
napoleon
iii
challenged
a
place
in
the
academy
by
his
of
caesar
literature
has
also
been
the
chief
solace
of
our
greatest
english
statesmen
when
pitt
retired
from
office
like
his
great
contemporary
fox
he
reverted
with
delight
to
the
study
of
the
greek
and
roman
classics
indeed
grenville
considered
pitt
the
best
greek
scholar
he
had
ever
known
canning
and
wellesley
when
in
retirement
occupied
themselves
in
translating
the
odes
and
satires
of
horace
passion
for
literature
entered
into
all
his
pursuits
and
gave
a
colour
to
his
whole
life
his
biographer
says
of
him
that
after
a
dinner
at
pitt
while
the
rest
of
the
company
were
dispersed
in
conversation
he
and
pitt
would
be
observed
poring
over
some
old
grecian
in
a
corner
of
the
fox
also
was
a
diligent
student
of
the
greek
authors
and
like
pitt
read
lycophron
he
was
also
the
author
of
a
history
of
james
though
the
book
is
only
a
fragment
and
it
must
be
confessed
is
rather
a
disappointing
work
one
of
the
most
able
and
laborious
of
our
recent
statesmen
with
whom
literature
was
a
hobby
as
well
as
a
pursuit
was
the
late
sir
george
cornewall
lewis
he
was
an
excellent
man
of
business
diligent
exact
and
painstaking
he
filled
by
turns
the
offices
of
president
of
the
poor
law
board
the
machinery
of
which
he
created
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
home
secretary
and
secretary
at
war
and
in
each
he
achieved
the
reputation
of
a
thoroughly
successful
administrator
in
the
intervals
of
his
official
labours
he
occupied
himself
with
inquiries
into
a
wide
range
of
subjects
history
politics
philology
anthropology
and
antiquarianism
his
works
on
astronomy
of
the
ancients
and
on
the
formation
of
the
romanic
languages
might
have
been
written
by
the
profoundest
of
german
savans
he
took
especial
delight
in
pursuing
the
abstruser
branches
of
learning
and
found
in
them
his
chief
pleasure
and
recreation
lord
palmerston
sometimes
remonstrated
with
him
telling
him
he
was
taking
too
much
out
of
himself
by
laying
aside
official
papers
after
in
order
to
study
books
palmerston
himself
declaring
that
he
had
no
time
to
read
books
that
the
reading
of
manuscript
was
quite
enough
for
him
doubtless
sir
george
lewis
rode
his
hobby
too
hard
and
but
for
his
devotion
to
study
his
useful
life
would
probably
have
been
prolonged
whether
in
or
out
of
office
he
read
wrote
and
studied
he
relinquished
the
editorship
of
the
review
to
become
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
and
when
no
longer
occupied
in
preparing
budgets
he
proceeded
to
copy
out
a
mass
of
greek
manuscripts
at
the
british
museum
he
took
particular
delight
in
pursuing
any
difficult
inquiry
in
classical
antiquity
one
of
the
odd
subjects
with
which
he
occupied
himself
was
an
examination
into
the
truth
of
reported
cases
of
longevity
which
according
to
his
custom
he
doubted
or
disbelieved
this
subject
was
uppermost
in
his
mind
while
pursuing
his
canvass
of
herefordshire
in
on
applying
to
a
voter
one
day
for
his
support
he
was
met
by
a
decided
refusal
i
am
sorry
was
the
reply
that
you
ca
give
me
your
vote
but
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
whether
anybody
in
your
parish
has
died
at
an
extraordinary
age
the
contemporaries
of
sir
george
lewis
also
furnish
many
striking
instances
of
the
consolations
afforded
by
literature
to
statesmen
wearied
with
the
toils
of
public
life
though
the
door
of
office
may
be
closed
that
of
literature
stands
always
open
and
men
who
are
at
in
politics
join
hands
over
the
poetry
of
homer
and
horace
the
late
earl
of
derby
on
retiring
from
power
produced
his
noble
version
of
iliad
which
will
probably
continue
to
be
read
when
his
speeches
have
been
forgotten
gladstone
similarly
occupied
his
leisure
in
preparing
for
the
press
his
on
homer
and
in
editing
a
translation
of
roman
state
while
disraeli
signalised
his
retirement
from
office
by
the
production
of
his
among
statesmen
who
have
figured
as
novelists
besides
disraeli
are
lord
russell
who
has
also
contributed
largely
to
history
and
biography
the
marquis
of
normandy
and
the
veteran
novelist
lord
lytton
with
whom
indeed
politics
may
be
said
to
have
been
his
recreation
and
literature
the
chief
employment
of
his
life
to
conclude
a
fair
measure
of
work
is
good
for

as
well
as
body
man

an
intelligence
sustained
and
preserved
by
bodily
organs

their
active
exercise
is
necessary

the
enjoyment

it
is
not
work
but
overwork
that
is
hurtful
and
it
is
not
hard

that
is

work

healthful

to
be
usefully

hopefully
employed
is
one
of
the
great
secrets
of
happiness
in
moderation
is
no
more
wearing
than
any
other
kind
of
work
duly
regulated
it
is
as
promotive
of
health
as
bodily
exercise
and
where
due
attention
is
paid
to
the
physical
system
it
seems
difficult
to
put
more
upon
a
man
than
he
can
bear
merely
to
eat
and
drink
and
sleep
one
way
idly
through
life
is
vastly
more
injurious
the
of
rust
is
even
faster
than
the
of
work
but
overwork
is
always
bad
economy
it
is
in
fact
great
waste
especially
if
conjoined
with
worry
indeed
worry
kills
far
more
than
work
does
it
frets
it
excites
it
consumes
the
body
as
sand
and
grit
which
occasion
excessive
friction

out

overwork
and
worry
have
both
to
be
guarded
against

it
is
exhausting
and
destructive
according
as
it
is
in
excess
of
nature

the

exhaust
and
overbalance

by

just

feats

were

to
be
adverse

an
assassin
for
the

reason
spinoza
remained
courageous
and
to
the
last
dying
in
obscurity
and
poverty
the
philosophy
of
descartes
was
denounced
as
leading
to
irreligion
the
doctrines
of
locke
were
said
to
produce
materialism
and
in
our
own
day
buckland
sedgwick
and
other
leading
geologists
have
been
accused
of
overturning
revelation
with
regard
to
the
constitution
and
history
of
the
earth
indeed
there
has
scarcely
been
a
discovery
in
astronomy
in
natural
history
or
in
physical
science
that
has
not
been
attacked
by
the
bigoted
and
as
leading
to
infidelity
other
great
discoverers
though
they
may
not
have
been
charged
with
irreligion
have
had
not
less
obloquy
of
a
professional
and
public
nature
to
encounter
when
harvey
published
his
theory
of
the
circulation
of
the
blood
his
practice
fell
off
and
the
medical
profession
stigmatised
him
as
a
fool
the
few
good
things
i
have
been
able
to
do
said
john
hunter
have
been
accomplished
with
the
greatest
difficulty
and
encountered
the
greatest
opposition
sir
charles
bell
while
employed
in
his
important
investigations
as
to
the
nervous
system
which
issued
in
one
of
the
greatest
of
physiological
discoveries
wrote
to
a
friend
if
i
were
not
so
poor
and
had
not
so
many
vexations
to
encounter
how
happy
would
i
be
but
he
himself
observed
that
his
practice
sensibly
fell
off
after
the
publication
of
each
successive
stage
of
his
discovery
thus
nearly
every
enlargement
of
the
domain
of
knowledge
which
has
made
us
better
acquainted
with
the
heavens
with
the
earth
and
with
ourselves
has
been
established
by
the
energy
the
devotion
the
and
the
courage
of
the
great
spirits
of
past
times
who
however
much
they
have
been
opposed
or
reviled
by
their
contemporaries
now
rank
amongst
those
whom
the
enlightened
of
the
human
race
most
delight
to
honour
nor
is
the
unjust
intolerance
displayed
towards
men
of
science
in
the
past
without
its
lesson
for
the
present
it
teaches
us
to
be
forbearant
towards
those
who
differ
from
us
provided
they
observe
patiently
think
honestly
and
utter
their
convictions
freely
and
truthfully
it
was
a
remark
of
plato
that
the
world
is
god
epistle
to
mankind
and
to
read
and
study
that
epistle
so
as
to
elicit
its
true
meaning
can
have
no
other
effect
on
a
mind
than
to
lead
to
a
deeper
impression
of
his
power
a
clearer
perception
of
his
wisdom
and
a
more
grateful
sense
of
his
goodness
while
such
has
been
the
courage
of
the
martyrs
of
science
not
less
glorious
has
been
the
courage
of
the
martyrs
of
faith
the
passive
endurance
of
the
man
or
woman
who
for
conscience
sake
is
found
ready
to
suffer
and
to
endure
in
solitude
without
so
much
as
the
encouragement
of
even
a
single
sympathising
voice
is
an
exhibition
of
courage
of
a
far
higher
kind
than
that
displayed
in
the
roar
of
battle
where
even
the
weakest
feels
encouraged
and
inspired
by
the
enthusiasm
of
sympathy
and
the
power
of
numbers
time
would
fail
to
tell
of
the
deathless
names
of
those
who
through
faith
in
principles
and
in
the
face
of
difficulty
danger
and
suffering
have
wrought
righteousness
and
waxed
valiant
in
the
moral
warfare
of
the
world
and
been
content
to
lay
down
their
lives
rather
than
prove
false
to
their
conscientious
convictions
of
the
truth
men
of
this
stamp
inspired
by
a
high
sense
of
duty
have
in
past
times
exhibited
character
in
its
most
heroic
aspects
and
continue
to
present
to
us
some
of
the
noblest
spectacles
to
be
seen
in
history
even
women
full
of
tenderness
and
gentleness
not
less
than
men
have
in
this
cause
been
found
capable
of
exhibiting
the
most
unflinching
courage
such
for
instance
as
that
of
anne
askew
who
when
racked
until
her
bones
were
dislocated
uttered
no
cry
moved
no
muscle
but
looked
her
tormentors
calmly
in
the
face
and
refused
either
to
confess
or
to
recant
or
such
as
that
of
latimer
and
ridley
who
instead
of
bewailing
their
hard
fate
and
beating
their
breasts
went
as
cheerfully
to
their
death
as
a
bridegroom
to
the
altar
the
one
bidding
the
other
to
be
of
good
comfort
for
that
we
shall
this
day
light
such
a
candle
in
england
by
god
grace
as
shall
never
be
put
out
or
such
again
as
that
of
mary
dyer
the
quakeress
hanged
by
the
puritans
of
new
england
for
preaching
to
the
people
who
ascended
the
scaffold
with
a
willing
step
and
after
calmly
addressing
those
who
stood
about
resigned
herself
into
the
hands
of
her
persecutors
and
died
in
peace
and
joy
not
less
courageous
was
the
behaviour
of
the
good
sir
thomas
more
who
marched
willingly
to
the
scaffold
and
died
cheerfully
there
rather
than
prove
false
to
his
conscience
when
more
had
made
his
final
decision
to
stand
upon
his
principles
he
felt
as
if
he
had
won
a
victory
and
said
to
his
roper
son
roper
i
thank
our
lord
the
field
is
won
the
duke
of
norfolk
told
him
of
his
danger
saying
by
the
mass
master
more
it
is
perilous
striving
with
princes
the
anger
of
a
prince
brings
death
is
that
all
my
lord
said
more
then
the
difference
between
you
and
me
is
this
that
i
shall
die
and
you
while
it
has
been
the
lot
of
many
great
men
in
times
of
difficulty
and
danger
to
be
cheered
and
supported
by
their
wives
more
had
no
such
consolation
his
helpmate
did
anything
but
console
him
during
his
imprisonment
in
the
tower
she
could
not
conceive
that
there
was
any
sufficient
reason
for
his
continuing
to
lie
there
when
by
merely
doing
what
the
king
required
of
him
he
might
at
once
enjoy
his
liberty
together
with
his
fine
house
at
chelsea
his
library
his
orchard
his
gallery
and
the
society
of
his
wife
and
children
i
marvel
said
she
to
him
one
day
that
you
who
have
been
alway
hitherto
taken
for
wise
should
now
so
play
the
fool
as
to
lie
here
in
this
close
filthy
prison
and
be
content
to
be
shut
up
amongst
mice
and
rats
when
you
might
be
abroad
at
your
liberty
if
you
would
but
do
as
the
bishops
have
done
but
more
saw
his
duty
from
a
different
point
of
view
it
was
not
a
mere
matter
of
personal
comfort
with
him
and
the
expostulations
of
his
wife
were
of
no
avail
he
gently
put
her
aside
saying
cheerfully
is
not
this
house
as
nigh
heaven
as
my
own
to
which
she
contemptuously
rejoined
tilly
vally
tilly
vally
more
daughter
margaret
roper
on
the
contrary
encouraged
her
father
to
stand
firm
in
his
principles
and
dutifully
consoled
and
cheered
him
during
his
long
confinement
deprived
of

wrote
his
letters
to
her
with
a
piece
of

in

of
them

were
to
declare
in

gave
me

not

make

was
a
martyr
to
veracity
he
would
not
swear
a
false
oath
and
he
perished
because
he
was
sincere
when
his
head
had
been
struck
off
it
was
placed
on
london
bridge
in
accordance
with
the
barbarous
practice
of
the
times
margaret

had
the
courage
to
ask
for
the
head
to
be
taken
down
and
given
to
her
and
carrying
her
affection
for
her
father
beyond
the
grave
she
desired
that
it
might
be
buried
with
her
when
she
died
and
long
after
when
margaret
roper
tomb
was
opened
the
precious
relic
was
observed
lying
on
the
dust
of
what
had
been
her
bosom
martin
luther
was
not
called
upon
to
lay
down
his
life
for
his
faith
but
from
the
day
that
he
declared
himself
against
the
pope
he
daily
ran
the
risk
of
losing
it
at
the
beginning
of
his
great
struggle
he
stood
almost
entirely
alone
the
odds
against
him
were
tremendous
on
one
side
said
he

a
poor
creature
a
man
of
yesterday
standing
wellnigh
alone
with
a
few
friends
summoned
by
the
emperor
to
appear
at
worms
to
answer
the
charge
made
against
him
of
heresy
he
determined
to
answer
in
person
those
about
him
told
him
that
he
would
lose
his
life
if
he
went
and
they
urged
him
to
fly
no
said
he
i
will
repair
thither
though
i
should
find
there
thrice
as
many
devils
as
there
are
tiles
upon
the
housetops
warned
against
the
bitter
enmity
of
a
certain
duke
george
he
said
i
will
go
there
though
for
nine
whole
days
running
it
rained
duke
georges
luther
was
as
good
as
his
word
and
he
set
forth
upon
his
perilous
journey
when
he
came
in
sight
of
the
old
of
worms
he
stood
up
in
his
chariot
and
sang
ein
feste
burg
ist
unser
gott
the
of
the
reformation
the
words
and
music
of
which
he
is
said
to
have
improvised
only
two
days
before
shortly
before
the
meeting
of
the
diet
an
old
soldier
george
freundesberg
put
his
hand
upon
luther
shoulder
and
said
to
him
good
monk
good
monk
take
heed
what
thou
doest
thou
art
going
into
a
harder
fight
than
any
of
us
have
ever
yet
been
in
but
luther
only
answer
to
the
veteran
was
that
he
had
determined
to
stand
upon
the
bible
and
his
conscience
luther
courageous
defence
before
the
diet
is
on
record
and
forms
one
of
the
most
glorious
pages
in
history
when
finally
urged
by
the
emperor
to
retract
he
said
firmly
sire
unless
i
am
convinced
of
my
error
by
the
testimony
of
scripture
or
by
manifest
evidence
i
can
not
and
will
not
retract
for
we
must
never
act
contrary
to
our
conscience
such
is
my
profession
of
faith
and
you
must
expect
none
other
from
me
hier
stehe
ich
ich
kann
nicht
anders

i
i
can
not
do
otherwise
god
help
me
he
had
to
do
his
duty
to
obey
the
orders
of
a
power
higher
than
that
of
kings
and
he
did
it
at
all
hazards
afterwards
when
hard
pressed
by
his
enemies
at
augsburg
luther
said
that
if
he
had
five
hundred
heads
he
would
lose
them
all
rather
than
recant
his
article
concerning
faith
like
all
courageous
men
his
strength
only
seemed
to
grow
in
proportion
to
the
difficulties
he
had
to
encounter
and
overcome
there
is
no
man
in
germany
said
hutten
who
more
utterly
despises
death
than
does
luther
and
to
his
moral
courage
perhaps
more
than
to
that
of
any
other
single
man
do
we
owe
the
liberation
of
modern
thought
and
the
vindication
of
the
great
rights
of
the
human
understanding
the
honourable
and
brave
man
does
not
fear
death
compared
with
ignominy
it
is
said
of
the
royalist
earl
of
strafford
that
as
he
walked
to
the
scaffold
on
tower
hill
his
step
and
manner
were
those
of
a
general
marching
at
the
head
of
an
army
to
secure
victory
rather
than
of
a
condemned
man
to
undergo
sentence
of
death
so
the
man
sir
john
eliot
went
alike
bravely
to
his
death
on
the
same
spot
saying
ten
thousand
deaths
rather
than
defile
my
conscience
the
chastity
and
purity
of
which
i
value
beyond
all
this
world
greatest
tribulation
was
on
account
of
his
wife
whom
he
had
to
leave
behind
when
he
saw
her
looking
down
upon
him
from
the
tower
window
he
stood
up
in
the
cart
waved
his
hat
and
cried
to
heaven
my
love
to
heaven
and
leave
you
in
the
storm
as
he
went
on
his
way
one
in
the
crowd
called
out
that
is
the
most
glorious
seat
you
ever
sat
on
to
which
he
replied
it
is
so
indeed
and
rejoiced
exceedingly
although
success
is
the
guerdon
for
which
all
men
toil
they
have
nevertheless
often
to
labour
on
perseveringly
without
any
glimmer
of
success
in
sight
they
have
to
live
meanwhile
upon
their
courage
sowing
their
seed
it
may
be
in
the
dark
in
the
hope
that
it
will
yet
take
root
and
spring
up
in
achieved
result
the
best
of
causes
have
had
to
fight
their
way
to
triumph
through
a
long
succession
of
failures
and
many
of
the
assailants
have
died
in
the
breach
before
the
fortress
has
been
won
the
heroism
they
have
displayed
is
to
be
measured
not
so
much
by
their
immediate
success
as
by
the
opposition
they
have
encountered
and
the
courage
with
which
they
have
maintained
the
struggle
the
patriot
who
fights
an
battle
the
martyr
who
goes
to
death
amidst
the
triumphant
shouts
of
his
enemies
the
discoverer
like
columbus
whose
heart
remains
undaunted
through
the
bitter
years
of
his
long
wandering
woe
are
examples
of
the
moral
sublime
which
excite
a
profounder
interest
in
the
hearts
of
men
than
even
the
most
complete
and
conspicuous
success
by
the
side
of
such
instances
as
these
how
small
by
comparison
seem
the
greatest
deeds
of
valour
inciting
men
to
rush
upon
death
and
die
amidst
the
frenzied
excitement
of
physical
warfare
but
the
greater
part
of
the
courage
that
is
needed
in
the
world
is
not
of
a
heroic
kind
courage
may
be
displayed
in
everyday
life
as
well
as
in
historic
fields
of
action
there
needs
for
example
the
common
courage
to
be
honest
the
courage
to
resist
temptation
the
courage
to
speak
the
truth
the
courage
to
be
what
we
really
are
and
not
to
pretend
to
be
what
we
are
not
the
courage
to
live
honestly
within
our
own
means
and
not
dishonestly
upon
the
means
of
others
a
great
deal
of
the
unhappiness
and
much
of
the
vice
of
the
world
is
owing
to
weakness
and
indecision
of
purpose
in
other
words
to
lack
of
courage
men
may
know
what
is
right
and
yet
fail
to
exercise
the
courage
to
do
it
they
may
understand
the
duty
they
have
to
do
but
will
not
summon
up
the
requisite
resolution
to
perform
it
the
weak
and
undisciplined
man
is
at
the
mercy
of
every
temptation
he
can
not
say
no
but
falls
before
it
and
if
his
companionship
be
bad
he
will
be
all
the
easier
led
away
by
bad
example
into
wrongdoing
nothing
can
be
more
certain
than
that
the
character
can
only
be
sustained
and
strengthened
by
its
own
energetic
action
the
will
which
is
the
central
force
of
character
must
be
trained
to
habits
of
decision
otherwise
it
will
neither
be
able
to
resist
evil
nor
to
follow
good
decision
gives
the
power
of
standing
firmly
when
to
yield
however
slightly
might
be
only
the
first
step
in
a
downhill
course
to
ruin
calling
upon
others
for
help
in
forming
a
decision
is
worse
than
useless
a
man
must
so
train
his
habits
as
to
rely
upon
his
own
powers
and
depend
upon
his
own
courage
in
moments
of
emergency
plutarch
tells
of
a
king
of
macedon
who
in
the
midst
of
an
action
withdrew
into
the
adjoining
town
under
pretence
of
sacrificing
to
hercules
whilst
his
opponent
emilius
at
the
same
time
that
he
implored
the
divine
aid
sought
for
victory
sword
in
hand
and
won
the
battle
and
so
it
ever
is
in
the
actions
of
daily
life
many
are
the
valiant
purposes
formed
that
end
merely
in
words
deeds
intended
that
are
never
done
designs
projected
that
are
never
begun
and
all
for
want
of
a
little
courageous
decision
better
far
the
silent
tongue
but
the
eloquent
deed
for
in
life
and
in
business
despatch
is
better
than
discourse
and
the
shortest
answer
of
all
is
doing
in
matters
of
great
concern
and
which
must
be
done
says
tillotson
there
is
no
surer
argument
of
a
weak
mind
than
irresolution
to
be
undetermined
when
the
case
is
so
plain
and
the
necessity
so
urgent
to
be
always
intending
to
live
a
new
life
but
never
to
find
time
to
set
about
it
this
is
as
if
a
man
should
put
off
eating
and
drinking
and
sleeping
from
one
day
to
another
until
he
is
starved
and
destroyed
there
needs
also
the
exercise
of
no
small
degree
of
moral
courage
to
resist
the
corrupting
influences
of
what
is
called
society
although
grundy
may
be
a
very
vulgar
and
commonplace
personage
her
influence
is
nevertheless
prodigious
most
men
but
especially
women
are
the
moral
slaves
of
the
class
or
caste
to
which
they
belong
there
is
a
sort
of
unconscious
conspiracy
existing
amongst
them
against
each
other
individuality
each
circle
and
section
each
rank
and
class
has
its
respective
customs
and
observances
to
which
conformity
is
required
at
the
risk
of
being
tabooed
some
are
immured
within
a
bastile
of
fashion
others
of
custom
others
of
opinion
and
few
there
are
who
have
the
courage
to
think
outside
their
sect
to
act
outside
their
party
and
to
step
out
into
the
free
air
of
individual
thought
and
action
we
dress
and
eat
and
follow
fashion
though
it
may
be
at
the
risk
of
debt
ruin
and
misery
living
not
so
much
according
to
our
means
as
according
to
the
superstitious
observances
of
our
class
though
we
may
speak
contemptuously
of
the
indians
who
flatten
their
heads
and
of
the
chinese
who
cramp
their
toes
we
have
only
to
look
at
the
deformities
of
fashion
amongst
ourselves
to
see
that
the
reign
of
grundy
is
universal
but
moral
cowardice
is
exhibited
quite
as
much
in
public
as
in
private
life
snobbism
is
not
confined
to
the
toadying
of
the
rich
but
is
quite
as
often
displayed
in
the
toadying
of
the
poor
formerly
sycophancy
showed
itself
in
not
daring
to
speak
the
truth
to
those
in
high
places
but
in
these
days
it
rather
shows
itself
in
not
daring
to
speak
the
truth
to
those
in
low
places
now
that
the
masses
exercise
political
power
there
is
a
growing
tendency
to
fawn
upon
them
to
flatter
them
and
to
speak
nothing
but
smooth
words
to
them
they
are
credited
with
virtues
which
they
themselves
know
they
do
not
possess
the
public
enunciation
of
wholesome
because
disagreeable
truths
is
avoided
and
to
win
their
favour
sympathy
is
often
pretended
for
views
the
carrying
out
of
which
in
practice
is
known
to
be
hopeless
it
is
not
the
man
of
the
noblest
character
the
and
man
whose
favour
is
now
sought
so
much
as
that
of
the
lowest
man
the
and
man
because
his
vote
is
usually
that
of
the
majority
even
men
of
rank
wealth
and
education
are
seen
prostrating
themselves
before
the
ignorant
whose
votes
are
thus
to
be
got
they
are
ready
to
be
unprincipled
and
unjust
rather
than
unpopular
it
is
so
much
easier
for
some
men
to
stoop
to
bow
and
to
flatter
than
to
be
manly
resolute
and
magnanimous
and
to
yield
to
prejudices
than
run
counter
to
them
it
requires
strength
and
courage
to
swim
against
the
stream
while
any
dead
fish
can
float
with
it
this
servile
pandering
to
popularity
has
been
rapidly
on
the
increase
of
late
years
and
its
tendency
has
been
to
lower
and
degrade
the
character
of
public
men
consciences
have
become
more
elastic
there
is
now
one
opinion
for
the
chamber
and
another
for
the
platform
prejudices
are
pandered
to
in
public
which
in
private
are
despised
pretended
conversions
which
invariably
jump
with
party
interests
are
more
sudden
and
even
hypocrisy
now
appears
to
be
scarcely
thought
discreditable
the
same
moral
cowardice
extends
downwards
as
well
as
upwards
the
action
and
reaction
are
equal
hypocrisy
and
timeserving
above
are
accompanied
by
hypocrisy
and
timeserving
below
where
men
of
high
standing
have
not
the
courage
of
their
opinions
what
is
to
be
expected
from
men
of
low
standing
they
will
only
follow
such
examples
as
are
set
before
them
they
too
will
skulk
and
dodge
and
prevaricate
be
ready
to
speak
one
way
and
act
another
just
like
their
betters
give
them
but
a
sealed
box
or
some
to
hide
their
act
in
and
they
will
then
enjoy
their
liberty
popularity
as
won
in
these
days
is
by
no
means
a
presumption
in
a
man
favour
but
is
quite
as
often
a
presumption
against
him
no
man
says
the
russian
proverb
can
rise
to
honour
who
is
cursed
with
a
stiff
backbone
but
the
backbone
of
the
is
of
gristle
and
he
has
no
difficulty
in
stooping
and
bending
himself
in
any
direction
to
catch
the
breath
of
popular
applause
where
popularity
is
won
by
fawning
upon
the
people
by
withholding
the
truth
from
them
by
writing
and
speaking
down
to
the
lowest
tastes
and
still
worse
by
appeals
to
such
a
popularity
must
be
simply
contemptible
in
the
sight
of
all
honest
men
jeremy
bentham
speaking
of
a
public
character
said
his
creed
of
politics
results
less
from
love
of
the
many
than
from
hatred
of
the
few
it
is
too
much
under
the
influence
of
selfish
and
dissocial
affection
to
how
many
men
in
our
own
day
might
not
the
same
description
apply
men
of
sterling
character
have
the
courage
to
speak
the
truth
even
when
it
is
unpopular
it
was
said
of
colonel
hutchinson
by
his
wife
that
he
never
sought
after
popular
applause
or
prided
himself
on
it
he
more
delighted
to
do
well
than
to
be
praised
and
never
set
vulgar
commendations
at
such
a
rate
as
to
act
contrary
to
his
own
conscience
or
reason
for
the
obtaining
them
nor
would
he
forbear
a
good
action
which
he
was
bound
to
though
all
the
world
disliked
it
for
he
ever
looked
on
things
as
they
were
in
themselves
not
through
the
dim
spectacles
of
vulgar
estimation
popularity
in
the
lowest
and
most
common
sense
said
sir
john
pakington
on
a
recent
occasion
is
not
worth
the
having
do
your
duty
to
the
best
of
your
power
win
the
approbation
of
your
own
conscience
and
popularity
in
its
best
and
highest
sense
is
sure
to
follow
when
richard
lovell
edgeworth
towards
the
close
of
his
life
became
very
popular
in
his
neighbourhood
he
said
one
day
to
his
daughter
maria
i
am
growing
dreadfully
popular
i
shall
be
good
for
nothing
soon
a
man
can
not
be
good
for
anything
who
is
very
popular
probably
he
had
in
his
mind
at
the
time
the
gospel
curse
of
the
popular
man
woe
unto
you
when
all
men
shall
speak
well
of
you
for
so
did
their
fathers
to
the
false
prophets
intellectual
intrepidity
is
one
of
the
vital
conditions
of
independence
and
of
character
a
man
must
have
the
courage
to
be
himself
and
not
the
shadow
or
the
echo
of
another
he
must
exercise
his
own
powers
think
his
own
thoughts
and
speak
his
own
sentiments
he
must
elaborate
his
own
opinions
and
form
his
own
convictions
it
has
been
said
that
he
who
dare
not
form
an
opinion
must
be
a
coward
he
who
will
not
must
be
an
idler
he
who
can
not
must
be
a
fool
but
it
is
precisely
in
this
element
of
intrepidity
that
so
many
persons
of
promise
fall
short
and
disappoint
the
expectations
of
their
friends
they
march
up
to
the
scene
of
action
but
at
every
step
their
courage
oozes
out
they
want
the
requisite
decision
courage
and
perseverance
they
calculate
the
risks
and
weigh
the
chances
until
the
opportunity
for
effective
effort
has
passed
it
may
be
never
to
return
men
are
bound
to
speak
the
truth
in
the
love
of
it
i
had
rather
suffer
said
john
pym
the
commonwealth
man
for
speaking
the
truth
than
that
the
truth
should
suffer
for
want
of
my
speaking
when
a
convictions
are
honestly
formed
after
fair
and
full
consideration
he
is
justified
in
striving
by
all
fair
means
to
bring
them
into
action
there
are
certain
states
of
society
and
conditions
of
affairs
in
which
a
man
is
bound
to
speak
out
and
be
antagonistic
when
conformity
is
not
only
a
weakness
but
a
sin
great
evils
are
in
some
cases
only
to
be
met
by
resistance
they
can
not
be
wept
down
but
must
be
battled
down
the
honest
man
is
naturally
antagonistic
to
fraud
the
truthful
man
to
lying
the
man
to
oppression
the
pureminded
man
to
vice
and
iniquity
they
have
to
do
battle
with
these
conditions
and
if
possible
overcome
them
such
men
have
in
all
ages
represented
the
moral
force
of
the
world
inspired
by
benevolence
and
sustained
by
courage
they
have
been
the
mainstays
of
all
social
renovation
and
progress
but
for
their
continuous
antagonism
to
evil
conditions
the
world
were
for
the
most
part
given
over
to
the
dominion
of
selfishness
and
vice
all
the
great
reformers
and
martyrs
were
antagonistic
men
enemies
to
falsehood
and
evildoing
the
apostles
themselves
were
an
organised
band
of
social
antagonists
who
contended
with
pride
selfishness
superstition
and
irreligion
and
in
our
own
time
the
lives
of
such
men
as
clarkson
and
granville
sharpe
father
mathew
and
richard
cobden
inspired
by
singleness
of
purpose
have
shown
what
highminded
social
antagonism
can
effect
it
is
the
strong
and
courageous
men
who
lead
and
guide
and
rule
the
world
the
weak
and
timid
leave
no
trace
behind
them
whilst
the
life
of
a
single
upright
and
energetic
man
is
like
a
track
of
light
his
example
is
remembered
and
appealed
to
and
his
thoughts
his
spirit
and
his
courage
continue
to
be
the
inspiration
of
succeeding
generations
it
is
energy
the
central
element
of
which
is
will
that
produces
the
miracles
of
enthusiasm
in
all
ages
everywhere
it
is
the
mainspring
of
what
is
called
force
of
character
and
the
sustaining
power
of
all
great
action
in
a
righteous
cause
the
determined
man
stands
upon
his
courage
as
upon
a
granite
block
and
like
david
he
will
go
forth
to
meet
goliath
strong
in
heart
though
an
host
be
encamped
against
him
men
often
conquer
difficulties
because
they
feel
they
can
their
confidence
in
themselves
inspires
the
confidence
of
others
when
caesar
was
at
sea
and
a
storm
began
to
rage
the
captain
of
the
ship
which
carried
him
became
unmanned
by
fear
what
art
thou
afraid
of
cried
the
great
captain
thy
vessel
carries
caesar
the
courage
of
the
brave
man
is
contagious
and
carries
others
along
with
it
his
stronger
nature
awes
weaker
natures
into
silence
or
inspires
them
with
his
own
will
and
purpose
the
persistent
man
will
not
be
baffled
or
repulsed
by
opposition
diogenes
desirous
of
becoming
the
disciple
of
antisthenes
went
and
offered
himself
to
the
cynic
he
was
refused
diogenes
still
persisting
the
cynic
raised
his
knotty
staff
and
threatened
to
strike
him
if
he
did
not
depart
strike
said
diogenes
you
will
not
find
a
stick
hard
enough
to
conquer
my
perseverance
antisthenes
overcome
had
not
another
word
to
say
but
forthwith
accepted
him
as
his
pupil
energy
of
temperament
with
a
moderate
degree
of
wisdom
will
carry
a
man
further
than
any
amount
of
intellect
without
it
energy
makes
the
man
of
practical
ability
it
gives
him
vis
force
momentum
it
is
the
active
motive
power
of
character
and
if
combined
with
sagacity
and
will
enable
a
man
to
employ
his
powers
to
the
best
advantage
in
all
the
affairs
of
life
hence
it
is
that
inspired
by
energy
of
purpose
men
of
comparatively
mediocre
powers
have
often
been
enabled
to
accomplish
such
extraordinary
results
for
the
men
who
have
most
powerfully
influenced
the
world
have
not
been
so
much
men
of
genius
as
men
of
strong
convictions
and
enduring
capacity
for
work
impelled
by
irresistible
energy
and
invincible
determination
such
men
for
example
as
were
mahomet
luther
knox
calvin
loyola
and
wesley
courage
combined
with
energy
and
perseverance
will
overcome
difficulties
apparently
insurmountable
it
gives
force
and
impulse
to
effort
and
does
not
permit
it
to
retreat
tyndall
said
of
faraday
that
in
his
warm
moments
he
formed
a
resolution
and
in
his
cool
ones
he
made
that
resolution
good
perseverance
working
in
the
right
direction
grows
with
time
and
when
steadily
practised
even
by
the
most
humble
will
rarely
fail
of
its
reward
trusting
in
the
help
of
others
is
of
comparatively
little
use
when
one
of
michael
principal
patrons
died
he
said
i
begin
to
understand
that
the
promises
of
the
world
are
for
the
most
part
vain
phantoms
and
that
to
confide
in
one
self
and
become
something
of
worth
and
value
is
the
best
and
safest
course
courage
is
by
no
means
incompatible
with
tenderness
on
the
contrary
gentleness
and
tenderness
have
been
found
to
characterise
the
men
not
less
than
the
women
who
have
done
the
most
courageous
deeds
sir
charles
napier
gave
up
sporting
because
he
could
not
bear
to
hurt
dumb
creatures
the
same
gentleness
and
tenderness
characterised
his
brother
sir
william
the
historian
of
the
peninsular
war
such
also
was
the
character
of
sir
james
outram
pronounced
by
sir
charles
napier
to
be
the
bayard
of
india
sans
peur
et
sans
reproche
one
of
the
bravest
and
yet
gentlest
of
men
respectful
and
reverent
to
women
tender
to
children
helpful
of
the
weak
stern
to
the
corrupt
but
kindly
as
summer
to
the
honest
and
deserving
moreover
he
was
himself
as
honest
as
day
and
as
pure
as
virtue
of
him
it
might
be
said
with
truth
what
fulke
greville
said
of
sidney
he
was
a
true
model
of
worth
a
man
fit
for
conquest
reformation
plantation
or
what
action
soever
is
the
greatest
and
hardest
among
men
his
chief
ends
withal
being
above
all
things
the
good
of
his
fellows
and
the
service
of
his
sovereign
and
country
when
edward
the
black
prince
won
the
battle
of
poictiers
in
which
he
took
prisoner
the
french
king
and
his
son
he
entertained
them
in
the
evening
at
a
banquet
when
he
insisted
on
waiting
upon
and
serving
them
at
table
the
gallant
prince
knightly
courtesy
and
demeanour
won
the
hearts
of
his
captives
as
completely
as
his
valour
had
won
their
persons
for
notwithstanding
his
youth
edward
was
a
true
knight
the
first
and
bravest
of
his
time
a
noble
pattern
and
example
of
chivalry
his
two
mottoes
and
dien
spirit
and
reverent
service
not
inaptly
expressing
his
prominent
and
pervading
qualities
it
is
the
courageous
man
who
can
best
afford
to
be
generous
or
rather
it
is
his
nature
to
be
so
when
fairfax
at
the
battle
of
naseby
seized
the
colours
from
an
ensign
whom
he
had
struck
down
in
the
fight
he
handed
them
to
a
common
soldier
to
take
care
of
the
soldier
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
boasted
to
his
comrades
that
he
had
himself
seized
the
colours
and
the
boast
was
repeated
to
fairfax
let
him
retain
the
honour
said
the
commander
i
have
enough
beside
so
when
douglas
at
the
battle
of
bannockburn
saw
randolph
his
rival
outnumbered
and
apparently
overpowered
by
the
enemy
he
prepared
to
hasten
to
his
assistance
but
seeing
that
randolph
was
already
driving
them
back
he
cried
out
hold
and
halt
we
are
come
too
late
to
aid
them
let
us
not
lessen
the
victory
they
have
won
by
affecting
to
claim
a
share
in
it
quite
as
chivalrous
though
in
a
very
different
field
of
action
was
the
conduct
of
laplace
to
the
young
philosopher
biot
when
the
latter
had
read
to
the
french
academy
his
paper
sur
les
equations
aux
difference
melees
the
assembled
savans
at
its
close
felicitated
the
reader
of
the
paper
on
his
originality
monge
was
delighted
at
his
success
laplace
also
praised
him
for
the
clearness
of
his
demonstrations
and
invited
biot
to
accompany
him
home
arrived
there
laplace
took
from
a
closet
in
his
study
a
paper
yellow
with
age
and
handed
it
to
the
young
philosopher
to
biot
surprise
he
found
that
it
contained
the
solutions
all
worked
out
for
which
he
had
just
gained
so
much
applause
with
rare
magnanimity

of
the
circumstance
from
biot
until
the
latter
had
initiated
his
reputation
before
the
academy
moreover
he
enjoined
him
to
silence
and
the
incident
would
have
remained
a
secret
had
not
biot
himself
published
it
some
fifty
years
afterwards
an
incident
is
related
of
a
french
artisan
exhibiting
the
same
characteristic
of
in
another
form
in
front
of
a
lofty
house
in
course
of
erection
at
paris
was
the
usual
scaffold
loaded
with
men
and
materials
the
scaffold
being
too
weak
suddenly
broke
down
and
the
men
upon
it
were
precipitated
to
the
ground
all
except
two
a
young
man
and
a
one
who
hung
on
to
a
narrow
ledge
which
trembled
under
their
weight
and
was
evidently
on
the
point
of
giving
way
pierre
cried
the
elder
of
the
two
let
go
i
am
the
father
of
a
family
juste
said
pierre
and
instantly
letting
go
his
hold
he
fell
and
was
killed
on
the
spot
the
father
of
the
family
was
saved
the
brave
man
is
magnanimous
as
well
as
gentle
he
does
not
take
even
an
enemy
at
a
disadvantage
nor
strike
a
man
when
he
is
down
and
unable
to
defend
himself
even
in
the
midst
of
deadly
strife
such
instances
of
generosity
have
not
been
uncommon
thus
at
the
battle
of
dettingen
during
the
heat
of
the
action
a
squadron
of
french
cavalry
charged
an
english
regiment
but
when
the
young
french
officer
who
led
them
and
was
about
to
attack
the
english
leader
observed
that
he
had
only
one
arm
with
which
he
held
his
bridle
the
frenchman
saluted
him
courteously
with
his
sword
and
passed
on
it
is
related
of
charles
that
after
the
siege
and
capture
of
wittenburg
by
the
imperialist
army
the
monarch
went
to
see
the
tomb
of
luther
while
reading
the
inscription
on
it
one
of
the
servile
courtiers
who
accompanied
him
proposed
to
open
the
grave
and
give
the
ashes
of
the
heretic
to
the
winds
the
monarch
cheek
flushed
with
honest
indignation
i

not
with
the
dead
said
he
let
this
place
be
respected
the
portrait
which
the
great
heathen
aristotle
drew
of
the
magnanimous
man
in
other
words
the
true
gentleman
more
than
two
thousand
years
ago
is
as
faithful
now
as
it
was
then
the
magnanimous
man
he
said
will
behave
with
moderation
under
both
good
fortune
and
bad
he
will
know
how
to
be
exalted
and
how
to
be
abased
he
will
neither
be
delighted
with
success
nor
grieved
by
failure
he
will
neither
shun
danger
nor
seek
it
for
there
are
few
things
which
he
cares
for
he
is
reticent
and
somewhat
slow
of
speech
but
speaks
his
mind
openly
and
boldly
when
occasion
calls
for
it
he
is
apt
to
admire
for
nothing
is
great
to
him
he
overlooks
injuries
he
is
not
given
to
talk
about
himself
or
about
others
for
he
does
not
care
that
he
himself
should
be
praised
or
that
other
people
should
be
blamed
he
does
not
cry
out
about
trifles
and
craves
help
from
none
on
the
other
hand
mean
men
admire
meanly
they
have
neither
modesty
generosity
nor
magnanimity
they
are
ready
to
take
advantage
of
the
weakness
or
defencelessness
of
others
especially
where
they
have
themselves
succeeded
by
unscrupulous
methods
in
climbing
to
positions
of
authority
snobs
in
high
places
are
always
much
less
tolerable
than
snobs
of
low
degree
because
they
have
more
frequent
opportunities
of
making
their
want
of
manliness
felt
they
assume
greater
airs
and
are
pretentious
in
all
that
they
do
and
the
higher
their
elevation
the
more
conspicuous
is
the
incongruity
of
their
position
the
higher
the
monkey
climbs
says
the
proverb
the
more
he
shows
his
tail
much
depends
on
the
way
in
which
a
thing
is
done
an
act
which
might
be
taken
as
a
kindness
if
done
in
a
generous
spirit
when
done
in
a
grudging
spirit
may
be
felt
as
stingy
if
not
harsh
and
even
cruel
when
ben
jonson
lay
sick
and
in
poverty
the
king
sent
him
a
paltry
message
accompanied
by
a
gratuity
the
sturdy
plainspoken
poet
reply
was
i
suppose
he
sends
me
this
because
i
live
in
an
alley
tell
him
his
soul
lives
in
an
alley
from
what
we
have
said
it
will
be
obvious
that
to
be
of
an
enduring
and
courageous
spirit
is
of
great
importance
in
the
formation
of
character
it
is
a
source
not
only
of
usefulness
in
life
but
of
happiness
on
the
other
hand
to
be
of
a
timid
and
still
more
of
a
cowardly
nature
is
one
of
the
greatest
misfortunes
wise
man
was
accustomed
to
say
that
one
of
the
principal
objects
he
aimed
at
in
the
education
of
his
sons
and
daughters
was
to
train
them
in
the
habit
of
fearing
nothing
so
much
as
fear
and
the
habit
of
avoiding
fear
is
doubtless
capable
of
being
trained
like
any
other
habit
such
as
the
habit
of
attention
of
diligence
of
study
or
of
cheerfulness
much
of
the
fear
that
exists
is
the
offspring
of
imagination
which
creates
the
images
of
evils
which
may
happen
but
perhaps
rarely
do
and
thus
many
persons
who
are
capable
of
summoning
up
courage
to
grapple
with
and
overcome
real
dangers
are
paralysed
or
thrown
into
consternation
by
those
which
are
imaginary
hence
unless
the
imagination
be
held
under
strict
discipline
we
are
prone
to
meet
evils
more
than
halfway
to
suffer
them
by
forestalment
and
to
assume
the
burdens
which
we
ourselves
create
education
in
courage
is
not
usually
included
amongst
the
branches
of
female
training
and
yet
it
is
really
of
greater
importance
than
either
music
french
or
the
use
of
the
globes
contrary
to
the
view
of
sir
richard
steele
that
women
should
be
characterised
by
a
tender
fear
and
an
inferiority
which
makes
her
lovely
we
would
have
women
educated
in
resolution
and
courage
as
a
means
of
rendering
them
more
helpful
more
and
vastly
more
useful
and
happy
there
is
indeed
nothing
attractive
in
timidity
nothing
loveable
in
fear
all
weakness
whether
of
mind
or
body
is
equivalent
to
deformity
and
the
reverse
of
interesting
courage
is
graceful
and
dignified
whilst
fear
in
any
form
is
mean
and
repulsive
yet
the
utmost
tenderness
and
gentleness
are
consistent
with
courage
ary
scheffer
the
artist
once
wrote
to
his
daughter
dear
daughter
strive
to
be
of
good
courage
to
be
these
are
the
true
qualities
for
woman
everybody
must
expect
there
is
but
one
way
of
looking
at
fate
whatever
that
be
whether
blessings
or
afflictions
to
behave
with
dignity
under
both
we
must
not
lose
heart
or
it
will
be
the
worse
both
for
ourselves
and
for
those
whom
we
love
to
struggle
and
again
and
again
to
renew
the
conflict
this
is
life
inheritance
in
sickness
and
sorrow
none
are
braver
and
less
complaining
sufferers
than
women
their
courage
where
their
hearts
are
concerned
is
indeed
proverbial
oh
femmes
a
tort
vous
nommes
timides
a
la
voix
de
vos
coeurs
vous
etes
intrepides
experience
has
proved
that
women
can
be
as
enduring
as
men
under
the
heaviest
trials
and
calamities
but
too
little
pains
are
taken
to
teach
them
to
endure
petty
terrors
and
frivolous
vexations
with
fortitude
such
little
miseries
if
petted
and
indulged
quickly
run
into
sickly
sensibility
and
become
the
bane
of
their
life
keeping
themselves
and
those
about
them
in
a
state
of
chronic
discomfort
the
best
corrective
of
this
condition
of
mind
is
wholesome
moral
and
mental
discipline
mental
strength
is
as
necessary
for
the
development
of
woman
character
as
of
man
it
gives
her
capacity
to
deal
with
the
affairs
of
life
and
presence
of
mind
which
enable
her
to
act
with
vigour
and
effect
in
moments
of
emergency
character
in
a
woman
as
in
a
man
will
always
be
found
the
best
safeguard
of
virtue
the
best
nurse
of
religion
the
best
corrective
of
time
personal
beauty
soon
passes
but
beauty
of
mind
and
character
increases
in
attractiveness
the
older
it
grows
ben
jonson
gives
a
striking
portraiture
of
a
noble
woman
in
these
lines
i
meant
she
should
be
courteous
facile
sweet
free
from
that
solemn
vice
of
greatness
pride
i
meant
each
softed
virtue
there
should
meet
fit
in
that
softer
bosom
to
abide
only
a
learned
and
a
manly
soul
i
purposed
her
that
should
with
even
powers
the
rock
the
spindle
and
the
shears
control
of
destiny
and
spin
her
own
free
hours
the
courage
of
woman
is
not
the
less
true
because
it
is
for
the
most
part
passive
it
is
not
encouraged
by
the
cheers
of
the
world
for
it
is
mostly
exhibited
in
the
recesses
of
private
life
yet
there
are
cases
of
heroic
patience
and
endurance
on
the
part
of
women
which
occasionally
come
to
the
light
of
day
one
of
the
most
celebrated
instances
in
history
is
that
of
gertrude
von
der
wart
her
husband
falsely
accused
of
being
an
accomplice
in
the
murder
of
the
emperor
albert
was
condemned
to
the
most
frightful
of
all
punishments
to
be
broken
alive
on
the
wheel
with
most
profound
conviction
of
her
husband
innocence
the
faithful
woman
stood
by
his
side
to
the
last
watching
over
him
during
two
days
and
nights
braving
the
empress
anger
and
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
in
the
hope
of
contributing
to
soothe
his
dying
agonies
but
women
have
not
only
distinguished
themselves
for
their
passive
courage
impelled
by
affection
or
the
sense
of
duty
they
have
occasionally
become
heroic
when
the
band
of
conspirators
who
sought
the
life
of
james
ii
of
scotland
burst
into
his
lodgings
at
perth
the
king
called
to
the
ladies
who
were
in
the
chamber
outside
his
room
to
keep
the
door
as
well
as
they
could
and
give
him
time
to
escape
the
conspirators
had
previously
destroyed
the
locks
of
the
doors
so
that
the
keys
could
not
be
turned
and
when
they
reached
the
apartment
it
was
found
that
the
bar
also
had
been
removed
but
on
hearing
them
approach
the
brave
catherine
douglas
with
the
hereditary
courage
of
her
family
boldly
thrust
her
arm
across
the
door
instead
of
the
bar
and
held
it
there
until
her
arm
being
broken
the
conspirators
burst
into
the
room
with
drawn
swords
and
daggers
overthrowing
the
ladies
who
though
unarmed
still
endeavoured
to
resist
them
the
defence
of
lathom
house
by
charlotte
de
la
tremouille
the
worthy
descendant
of
william
of
nassau
and
admiral
coligny
was
another
striking
instance
of
heroic
bravery
on
the
part
of
a
noble
woman
when
summoned
by
the
parliamentary
forces
to
surrender
she
declared
that
she
had
been
entrusted
by
her
husband
with
the
defence
of
the
house
and
that
she
could
not
give
it
up
without
her
dear
lord
orders
but
trusted
in
god
for
protection
and
deliverance
in
her
arrangements
for
the
defence
she
is
described
as
having
left
nothing
with
her
eye
to
be
excused
afterwards
by
fortune
or
negligence
and
added
to
her
former
patience
a
most
resolved
fortitude
the
brave
lady
held
her
house
and
home
good
against
the
enemy
for
a
whole
year
during
three
months
of
which
the
place
was
strictly
besieged
and
bombarded
until
at
length
the
siege
was
raised
after
a
most
gallant
defence
by
the
advance
of
the
royalist
army
nor
can
we
forget
the
courage
of
lady
franklin
who
persevered
to
the
last
when
the
hopes
of
all
others
had
died
out
in
prosecuting
the
search
after
the
franklin
expedition
on
the
occasion
of
the
royal
geographical
society
determining
to
award
the
founder
medal
to
lady
franklin
sir
roderick
murchison
observed
that
in
the
course
of
a
long
friendship
with
her
he
had
abundant
opportunities
of
observing
and
testing
the
sterling
qualities
of
a
woman
who
had
proved
herself
worthy
of
the
admiration
of
mankind
nothing
daunted
by
failure
after
failure
through
twelve
long
years
of
hope
deferred
she
had
persevered
with
a
singleness
of
purpose
and
a
sincere
devotion
which
were
truly
unparalleled
and
now
that
her
one
last
expedition
of
the
fox
under
the
gallant
had
realised
the
two
great
facts
that
her
husband
had
traversed
wide
seas
unknown
to
former
navigators
and
died
in
discovering
a
passage
then
surely
the
adjudication
of
the
medal
would
be
hailed
by
the
nation
as
one
of
the
many
recompences
to
which
the
widow
of
the
illustrious
franklin
was
so
eminently
entitled
but
that
devotion
to
duty
which
marks
the
heroic
character
has
more
often
been
exhibited
by
women
in
deeds
of
charity
and
mercy
the
greater
part
of
these
are
never
known
for
they
are
done
in
private
out
of
the
public
sight
and
for
the
mere
love
of
doing
good
where
fame
has
come
to
them
because
of
the
success
which
has
attended
their
labours
in
a
more
general
sphere
it
has
come
unsought
and
unexpected
and
is
often
felt
as
a
burden
who
has
not
heard
of
fry
and
miss
carpenter
as
prison
visitors
and
reformers
of
chisholm
and
miss
rye
as
promoters
of
emigration
and
of
miss
nightingale
and
miss
garrett
as
apostles
of
hospital
nursing
that
these
women
should
have
emerged
from
the
sphere
of
private
and
domestic
life
to
become
leaders
in
philanthropy
indicates
no
small
degree
of
moral
courage
on
their
part
for
to
women
above
all
others
quiet
and
ease
and
retirement
are
most
natural
and
welcome
very
few
women
step
beyond
the
boundaries
of
home
in
search
of
a
larger
field
of
usefulness
but
when
they
have
desired
one
they
have
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
it
the
ways
in
which
men
and
women
can
help
their
neighbours
are
innumerable
it
needs
but
the
willing
heart
and
ready
hand
most
of
the
philanthropic
workers
we
have
named
however
have
scarcely
been
influenced
by
choice
the
duty
lay
in
their
way
it
seemed
to
be
the
nearest
to
them
and
they
set
about
doing
it
without
desire
for
fame
or
any
other
reward
but
the
approval
of
their
own
conscience
among
the
name
of
sarah
martin
is
much
less
known
than
that
of
fry
although
she
preceded
her
in
the
work
how
she
was
led
to
undertake
it
furnishes
at
the
same
time
an
illustration
of
womanly
trueheartedness
and
earnest
womanly
courage
sarah
martin
was
the
daughter
of
poor
parents
and
was
left
an
orphan
at
an
early
age
she
was
brought
up
by
her
grandmother
at
caistor
near
yarmouth
and
earned
her
living
by
going
out
to
families
as
at
a
shilling
a
day
in
a
woman
was
tried
and
sentenced
to
imprisonment
in
yarmouth
gaol
for
cruelly
beating
and
illusing
her
child
and
her
crime
became
the
talk
of
the
town
the
young
dressmaker
was
much
impressed
by
the
report
of
the
trial
and
the
desire
entered
her
mind
of
visiting
the
woman
in
gaol
and
trying
to
reclaim
her
she
had
often
before
on
passing
the
walls
of
the
borough
gaol
felt
impelled
to
seek
admission
with
the
object
of
visiting
the
inmates
reading
the
scriptures
to
them
and
endeavouring
to
lead
them
back
to
the
society
whose
laws
they
had
violated
at
length
she
could
not
resist
her
impulse
to
visit
the
mother
she
entered
the
lifted
the
knocker
and
asked
the
gaoler
for
admission
for
some
reason
or
other
she
was
refused
but
she
returned
repeated
her
request
and
this
time
she
was
admitted
the
culprit
mother
shortly
stood
before
her
when
sarah
martin
told
the
motive
of
her
visit
the
criminal
burst
into
tears
and
thanked
her
those
tears
and
thanks
shaped
the
whole
course
of
sarah
martin
and
the
poor
seamstress
while
maintaining
herself
by
her
needle
continued
to
spend
her
leisure
hours
in
visiting
the
prisoners
and
endeavouring
to
alleviate
their
condition
she
constituted
herself
their
chaplain
and
schoolmistress
for
at
that
time
they
had
neither
she
read
to
them
from
the
scriptures
and
taught
them
to
read
and
write
she
gave
up
an
entire
day
in
the
week
for
this
purpose
besides
sundays
as
well
as
other
intervals
of
spare
time
feeling
she
says
that
the

she
formed

she

to

arose
with

whether
in

to
recover
her

she
was
to
suspend

her
decision
had
already
been
made
i
had

two
years
of
her
ministrations
the
borough
magistrates
of
yarmouth
knowing
that
her
labours
saved
them
the
expense
of
a
schoolmaster
and
chaplain
they
had
become
bound
by
law
to
appoint
made
a
proposal
to
her
of
an
annual
salary
of
a
year
but
they
did
it
in
so
indelicate
a
manner
as
greatly
to
wound
her
sensitive
feelings
she
shrank
from
becoming
the
salaried
official
of
the
corporation
and
bartering
for
money
those
serviced
which
had
throughout
been
labours
of
love
but
the
gaol
committee
coarsely
informed
her
that
if
they
permitted
her
to
visit
the
prison
she
must
submit
to
their
terms
or
be
excluded
for
two
years
therefore
she
received
the
salary
of
a
year
the
acknowledgment
of
the
yarmouth
corporation
for
her
services
as
gaol
chaplain
and
schoolmistress
she
was
now
however
becoming
old
and
infirm
and
the
unhealthy
atmosphere
of
the
gaol
did
much
towards
finally
disabling
her
while
she
lay
on
her
deathbed
she
resumed
the
exercise
of
a
talent
she
had
occasionally
practised
before
in
her
moments
of
leisure
the
composition
of
sacred
poetry

works
of

may
not
excite
admiration
yet
never
were
verses
written
truer

fuller

her

was
a
nobler
poem
than
any
she
ever
wrote
full
of
true
courage

it

in

of
this
quality
that
shakspeare
defines
man
as
a
being
looking
before
and
after
it
forms
the
chief
distinction
between
man
and
the
mere
animal
and
indeed
there
can
be
no
true
manhood
without
it
is
at
the
root
of
all
the
virtues
let
a
man
give
the
reins
to
his
impulses
and
passions
and
from
that
moment
he
yields
up
his
moral
freedom
he
is
carried
along
the
current
of
life
and
becomes
the
slave
of
his
strongest
desire
for
the
time
being
to
be
morally
free
to
be
more
than
an
animal
man
must
be
able
to
resist

impulse
and
this
can
only
be
done
by
the
exercise
of
thus
it
is
this
power
which
constitutes
the
real
distinction
between
a
physical
and
a
moral
life
and
that
forms

primary
basis
of

in

not
to

who

to
the

this
stronger
man
is
he
who
by
discipline
exercises
a
constant
control
over
his
thoughts
his

and
his
acts
of
the
vicious
desires
that

which
when
indulged

into

before

by

of

purity
of

and

become

and

up
in

and

the
best

will
always
be
found
in

according
as

habit
is
formed
by
careful
training
and
it
is
astonishing
how
much
can
be
accomplished
by
systematic
discipline
and
drill
see
how
for
instance
out
of
the
most
unpromising
materials
such
as
roughs
picked
up
in
the
streets
or
raw
unkempt
country
lads
taken
from
the
plough
steady
discipline
and
drill
will
bring
out
the
unsuspected
qualities
of
courage
endurance
and
and
how
in
the
field
of
battle
or
even
on
the
more
trying
occasions
of
perils
by
sea
such
as
the
burning
of
the
sarah
sands
or
the
wreck
of
the
birkenhead
such
men
carefully
disciplined
will
exhibit
the
unmistakable
characteristics
of
true
bravery
and
heroism
nor
is
moral
discipline
and
drill
less
influential
in
the
formation
of
character
without
it
there
will
be
no
proper
system
and
order
in
the
regulation
of
the
life
upon
it
depends
the
cultivation
of
the
sense
of
the
education
of
the
habit
of
obedience
the
development
of
the
idea
of
duty
the
most
man
is
always
under
discipline
and
the
more
perfect
the
discipline
the
higher
will
be
his
moral
condition
he
has
to
drill
his
desires
and
keep
them
in
subjection
to
the
higher
powers
of
his
nature
they
must
obey
the
word
of
command
of
the
internal
monitor
the
conscience
otherwise
they
will
be
but
the
mere
slaves
of
their
inclinations
the
sport
of
feeling
and
impulse
in
the
supremacy
of
says
herbert
spencer
consists
one
of
the
perfections
of
the
ideal
man
not
to
be
impulsive
not
to
be
spurred
hither
and
thither
by
each
desire
that
in
turn
comes
uppermost
but
to
be
governed
by
the
joint
decision
of
the
feelings
in
council
assembled
before
whom
every
action
shall
have
been
fully
debated
and
calmly
determined
that
it
is
which
education
moral
education
at
least
strives
to
produce
the
first
seminary
of
moral
discipline
and
the
best
as
we
have
already
shown
is
the
home
next
comes
the
school
and
after
that
the
world
the
great
school
of
practical
life
each
is
preparatory
to
the
other
and
what
the
man
or
woman
becomes
depends
for
the
most
part
upon
what
has
gone
before
if
they
have
enjoyed
the
advantage
of
neither
the
home
nor
the
school
but
have
been
allowed
to
grow
up
untrained
untaught
and
undisciplined
then
woe
to
themselves
woe
to
the
society
of
which
they
form
part
the
home
is
always
that
in
which
the
discipline
is
the
most
perfect
and
yet
where
it
is
the
least
felt
moral
discipline
acts
with
the
force
of
a
law
of
nature
those
subject
to
it
yield
themselves
to
it
unconsciously
and
though
it
shapes
and
forms
the
whole
character
until
the
life
becomes
crystallized
in
habit
the
influence
thus
exercised
is
for
the
most
part
unseen
and
almost
unfelt
the
importance
of
strict
domestic
discipline
is
curiously
illustrated
by
a
fact
mentioned
in
schimmelpenninck
memoirs
to
the
following
effect
that
a
lady
who
with
her
husband
had
inspected
most
of
the
lunatic
asylums
of
england
and
the
continent
found
the
most
numerous
class
of
patients
was
almost
always
composed
of
those
who
had
been
only
children
and
whose
wills
had
therefore
rarely
been
thwarted
or
disciplined
in
early
life
whilst
those
who
were
members
of
large
families
and
who
had
been
trained
in
were
far
less
frequent
victims
to
the
malady
although
the
moral
character
depends
in
a
great
degree
on
temperament
and
on
physical
health
as
well
as
on
domestic
and
early
training
and
the
example
of
companions
it
is
also
in
the
power
of
each
individual
to
regulate
to
restrain
and
to
discipline
it
by
watchful
and
persevering
a
competent
teacher
has
said
of
the
propensities
and
habits
that
they
are
as
teachable
as
latin
and
greek
while
they
are
much
more
essential
to
happiness
johnson
though
himself
constitutionally
prone
to
melancholy
and
afflicted
by
it
as
few
have
been
from
his
earliest
years
said
that
a
man
being
in
a
good
or
bad
humour
very
much
depends
upon
his
will
we
may
train
ourselves
in
a
habit
of
patience
and
contentment
on
the
one
hand
or
of
grumbling
and
discontent
on
the
other
we
may
accustom
ourselves
to
exaggerate
small
evils
and
to
underestimate
great
blessings
we
may
even
become
the
victim
of
petty
miseries
by
giving
way
to
them
thus
we
may
educate
ourselves
in
a
happy
disposition
as
well
as
in
a
morbid
one
indeed
the
habit
of
viewing
things
cheerfully
and
of
thinking
about
life
hopefully
may
be
made
to
grow
up
in
us
like
any
other
habit
it
was
not
an
exaggerated
estimate
of
johnson
to
say
that
the
habit
of
looking
at
the
best
side
of
any
event
is
worth
far
more
than
a
thousand
pounds
a
year
the
religious
man
life
is
pervaded
by
rigid
and
he
is
to
be
sober
and
vigilant
to
eschew
evil
and
do
good
to
walk
in
the
spirit
to
be
obedient
unto
death
to
withstand
in
the
evil
day
and
having
done
all
to
stand
to
wrestle
against
spiritual
wickedness
and
against
the
rulers
of
the
darkness
of
this
world
to
be
rooted
and
built
up
in
faith
and
not
to
be
weary
of
for
in
due
season
he
shall
reap
if
he
faint
not
the
man
of
business
also
must
needs
be
subject
to
strict
rule
and
system
business
like
life
is
managed
by
moral
leverage
success
in
both
depending
in
no
small
degree
upon
that
regulation
of
temper
and
careful
which
give
a
wise
man
not
only
a
command
over
himself
but
over
others
forbearance
and
smooth
the
road
of
life
and
open
many
ways
which
would
otherwise
remain
closed
and
so
does
for
as
men
respect
themselves
so
will
they
usually
respect
the
personality
of
others
it
is
the
same
in
politics
as
in
business
success
in
that
sphere
of
life
is
achieved
less
by
talent
than
by
temper
less
by
genius
than
by
character
if
a
man
have
not
he
will
lack
patience
be
wanting
in
tact
and
have
neither
the
power
of
governing
himself
nor
of
managing
others
when
the
quality
most
needed
in
a
prime
minister
was
the
subject
of
conversation
in
the
presence
of
pitt
one
of
the
speakers
said
it
was
eloquence
another
said
it
was
knowledge
and
a
third
said
it
was
toil
no
said
pitt
it
is
patience
and
patience
means
a
quality
in
which
he
himself
was
superb
his
friend
george
rose
has
said
of
him
that
he
never
once
saw
pitt
out
of
temper
yet
although
patience
is
usually
regarded
as
a
slow
virtue
pitt
combined
with
it
the
most
extraordinary
readiness
vigour
and
rapidity
of
thought
as
well
as
action
it
is
by
patience
and
that
the
truly
heroic
character
is
perfected
these
were
among
the
most
prominent
characteristics
of
the
great
hampden
whose
noble
qualities
were
generously
acknowledged
even
by
his
political
enemies
thus
clarendon
described
him
as
a
man
of
rare
temper
and
modesty
naturally
cheerful
and
vivacious
and
above
all
of
a
flowing
courtesy
he
was
kind
and
intrepid
yet
gentle
of
unblameable
conversation
and
his
heart
glowed
with
love
to
all
men
he
was
not
a
man
of
many
words
but
being
of
unimpeachable
character
every
word
he
uttered
carried
weight
no
man
had
ever
a
greater
power
over
himself
he
was
very
temperate
in
diet
and
a
supreme
governor
over
all
his
passions
and
affections
and
he
had
thereby
great
power
over
other
men
sir
philip
warwick
another
of
his
political
opponents
incidentally
describes
his
great
influence
in
a
certain
debate
we
had
catched
at
each
other
locks
and
sheathed
our
swords
in
each
bowels
had
not
the
sagacity
and
great
calmness
of
hampden
by
a
short
speech
prevented
it
and
led
us
to
defer
our
angry
debate
until
the
next
morning
a
strong
temper
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
temper
but
the
stronger
the
temper
the
greater
is
the
need
of
and
johnson
says
men
grow
better
as
they
grow
older
and
improve
with
experience
but
this
depends
upon
the
width
and
depth
and
generousness
of
their
nature
it
is
not
men
faults
that
ruin
them
so
much
as
the
manner
in
which
they
conduct
themselves
after
the
faults
have
been
committed
the
wise
will
profit
by
the
suffering
they
cause
and
eschew
them
for
the
future
but
there
are
those
on
whom
experience
exerts
no
ripening
influence
and
who
only
grow
narrower
and
bitterer
and
more
vicious
with
time
what
is
called
strong
temper
in
a
young
man
often
indicates
a
large
amount
of
unripe
energy
which
will
expend
itself
in
useful
work
if
the
road
be
fairly
opened
to
it
it
is
said
of
stephen
gerard
a
frenchman
who
pursued
a
remarkably
successful
career
in
the
united
states
that
when
he
heard
of
a
clerk
with
a
strong
temper
he
would
readily
take
him
into
his
employment
and
set
him
to
work
in
a
room
by
himself
gerard
being
of
opinion
that
such
persons
were
the
best
workers
and
that
their
energy
would
expend
itself
in
work
if
removed
from
the
temptation
to
quarrel
strong
temper
may
only
mean
a
strong
and
excitable
will
uncontrolled
it
displays
itself
in
fitful
outbreaks
of
passion
but
controlled
and
held
in
subjection
like
steam
within
the
organised
mechanism
of
a
the
use
of
which
is
regulated
and
controlled
by
and
governors
and
levers
it
may
become
a
source
of
energetic
power
and
usefulness
hence
some
of
the
greatest
characters
in
history
have
been
men
of
strong
temper
but
of
equally
strong
determination
to
hold
their
motive
power
under
strict
regulation
and
control
the
famous
earl
of
strafford
was
of
an
extremely
choleric
and
passionate
nature
and
had
great
struggles
with
himself
in
his
endeavours
to
control
his
temper
referring
to
the
advice
of
one
of
his
friends
old
secretary
cooke
who
was
honest
enough
to
tell
him
of
his
weakness
and
to
caution
him
against
indulging
it
he
wrote
you
gave
me
a
good
lesson
to
be
patient
and
indeed
my
years
and
natural
inclinations
give
me
heat
more
than
enough
which
however
i
trust
more
experience
shall
cool
and
a
watch
over
myself
in
time
altogether
overcome
in
the
meantime
in
this
at
least
it
will
set
forth
itself
more
pardonable
because
my
earnestness
shall
ever
be
for
the
honour
justice
and
profit
of
my
master
and
it
is
not
always
anger
but
the
misapplying
of
it
that
is
the
vice
so
blameable
and
of
disadvantage
to
those
that
let
themselves
loose
cromwell
also
is
described
as
having
been
of
a
wayward
and
violent
temper
in
his
youth
cross
untractable
and
masterless
with
a
vast
quantity
of
youthful
energy
which
exploded
in
a
variety
of
youthful
mischiefs
he
even
obtained
the
reputation
of
a
roysterer
in
his
native
town
and
seemed
to
be
rapidly
going
to
the
bad
when
religion
in
one
of
its
most
rigid
forms
laid
hold
upon
his
strong
nature
and
subjected
it
to
the
iron
discipline
of
calvinism
an
entirely
new
direction
was
thus
given
to
his
energy
of
temperament
which
forced
an
outlet
for
itself
into
public
life
and
eventually
became
the
dominating
influence
in
england
for
a
period
of
nearly
twenty
years
the
heroic
princes
of
the
house
of
nassau
were
all
distinguished
for
the
same
qualities
of
and
determination
of
purpose
william
the
silent
was
so
called
not
because
he
was
a
taciturn
man
for
he
was
an
eloquent
and
powerful
speaker
where
eloquence
was
necessary
but
because
he
was
a
man
who
could
hold
his
tongue
when
it
was
wisdom
not
to
speak
and
because
he
carefully
kept
his
own
counsel
when
to
have
revealed
it
might
have
been
dangerous
to
the
liberties
of
his
country
he
was
so
gentle
and
conciliatory
in
his
manner
that
his
enemies
even
described
him
as
timid
and
pusillanimous
yet
when
the
time
for
action
came
his
courage
was
heroic
his
determination
unconquerable
the
rock
in
the
ocean
says
motley
the
historian
of
the
netherlands
tranquil
amid
raging
billows
was
the
favourite
emblem
by
which
his
friends
expressed
their
sense
of
his
firmness
motley
compares
william
the
silent
to
washington
whom
he
in
many
respects
resembled
the
american
like
the
dutch
patriot
stands
out
in
history
as
the
very
impersonation
of
dignity
bravery
purity
and
personal
excellence
his
command
over
his
feelings
even
in
moments
of
great
difficulty
and
danger
was
such
as
to
convey
the
impression
to
those
who
did
not
know
him
intimately
that
he
was
a
man
of
inborn
calmness
and
almost
impassiveness
of
disposition
yet
washington
was
by
nature
ardent
and
impetuous
his
mildness
gentleness
politeness
and
consideration
for
others
were
the
result
of
rigid
and
unwearied
which
he
diligently
practised
even
from
his
boyhood
his
biographer
says
of
him
that
his
temperament
was
ardent
his
passions
strong
and
amidst
the
multiplied
scenes
of
temptation
and
excitement
through
which
he
passed
it
was
his
constant
effort
and
ultimate
triumph
to
check
the
one
and
subdue
the
other
and
again
his
passions
were
strong
and
sometimes
they
broke
out
with
vehemence
but
he
had
the
power
of
checking
them
in
an
instant
perhaps
was
the
most
remarkable
trait
of
his
character
it
was
in
part
the
effect
of
discipline
yet
he
seems
by
nature
to
have
possessed
this
power
in
a
degree
which
has
been
denied
to
other
men
the
duke
of
wellington
natural
temper
like
that
of
napoleon
was
irritable
in
the
extreme
and
it
was
only
by
watchful
that
he
was
enabled
to
restrain
it
he
studied
calmness
and
coolness
in
the
midst
of
danger
like
any
indian
chief
at
waterloo
and
elsewhere
he
gave
his
orders
in
the
most
critical
moments
without
the
slightest
excitement
and
in
a
tone
of
voice
almost
more
than
usually
subdued
wordsworth
the
poet
was
in
his
childhood
of
a
stiff
moody
and
violent
temper
and
perverse
and
obstinate
in
defying
chastisement
when
experience
of
life
had
disciplined
his
temper
he
learnt
to
exercise
greater
but
at
the
same
time
the
qualities
which
distinguished
him
as
a
child
were
afterwards
useful
in
enabling
him
to
defy
the
criticism
of
his
enemies
nothing
was
more
marked
than
wordsworth
and
as
well
as
his
of
power
at
all
periods
of
his
history
henry
martyn
the
missionary
was
another
instance
of
a
man
in
whom
strength
of
temper
was
only
so
much
unripe
energy
as
a
boy
he
was
impatient
petulant
and
perverse
but
by
constant
wrestling
against
his
tendency
to
wrongheadedness
he
gradually
gained
the
requisite
strength
so
as
to
entirely
overcome
it
and
to
acquire
what
he
so
greatly
coveted
the
gift
of
patience
a
man
may
be
feeble
in
organization
but
blessed
with
a
happy
temperament
his
soul
may
be
great
active
noble
and
sovereign
professor
tyndall
has
given
us
a
fine
picture
of
the
character
of
faraday
and
of
his
labours
in
the
cause
of
science
exhibiting
him
as
a
man
of
strong
original
and
even
fiery
nature
and
yet
of
extreme
tenderness
and
sensibility
underneath
his
sweetness
and
gentleness
he
says
was
the
heat
of
a
volcano
he
was
a
man
of
excitable
and
fiery
nature
but
through
high
he
had
converted
the
fire
into
a
central
glow
and
motive
power
of
life
instead
of
permitting
it
to
waste
itself
in
useless
passion
there
was
one
fine
feature
in
faraday
character
which
is
worthy
of
notice
one
closely
akin
to
it
was
his
by
devoting
himself
to
analytical
chemistry
he
might
have
speedily
realised
a
large
fortune
but
he
nobly
resisted
the
temptation
and
preferred
to
follow
the
path
of
pure
science
taking
the
duration
of
his
life
into
account
says
tyndall
this
son
of
a
blacksmith
and
apprentice
to
a
bookbinder
had
to
decide
between
a
fortune
of
on
the
one
side
and
his
undowered
science
on
the
other
he
chose
the
latter
and
died
a
poor
man
but
his
was
the
glory
of
holding
aloft
among
the
nations
the
scientific
name
of
england
for
a
period
of
forty
years
take
a
like
instance
of
the
of
a
frenchman
the
historian
anquetil
was
one
of
the
small
number
of
literary
men
in
france
who
refused
to
bow
to
the
napoleonic
yoke
he
sank
into
great
poverty
living
on
and
limiting
his
expenditure
to
only
three
sous
a
day
i
have
still
two
sous
a
day
left
said
he
for
the
conqueror
of
marengo
and
austerlitz
but
if
you
fall
sick
said
a
friend
to
him
you
will
need
the
help
of
a
pension
why
not
do
as
others
do
pay
court
to
the
emperor
you
have
need
of
him
to
live
i
do
not
need
him
to
die
was
the
historian
reply
but
anquetil
did
not
die
of
poverty
he
lived
to
the
age
of
saying
to
a
friend
on
the
eve
of
his
death
come
see
a
man
who
dies
still
full
of
life
sir
james
outram
exhibited
the
same
characteristic
of
noble
though
in
an
altogether
different
sphere
of
life
like
the
great
king
arthur
he
was
emphatically
a
man
who
forbore
his
own
advantage
he
was
characterised
throughout
his
whole
career
by
his
noble
unselfishness
though
he
might
personally
disapprove
of
the
policy
he
was
occasionally
ordered
to
carry
out
he
never
once
faltered
in
the
path
of
duty
thus
he
did
not
approve
of
the
policy
of
invading
scinde
yet
his
services
throughout
the
campaign
were
acknowledged
by
general
sir
napier
to
have
been
of
the
most
brilliant
character
but
when
the
war
was
over
and
the
rich
spoils
of
scinde
lay
at
the
conqueror
feet
outram
said
i
disapprove
of
the
policy
of
this
war
i
will
accept
no
share
of
the
not
less
marked
was
his
generous
when
despatched
with
a
strong
force
to
aid
havelock
in
fighting
his
way
to
lucknow
as
superior
officer
he
was
entitled
to
take
upon
himself
the
chief
command
but
recognising
what
havelock
had
already
done
with
rare
disinterestedness
he
left
to
his
junior
officer
the
glory
of
completing
the
campaign
offering
to
serve
under
him
as
a
volunteer
with
such
reputation
said
lord
clyde
as
outram
has
won
for
himself
he
can
afford
to
share
glory
and
honour
with
others
but
that
does
not
lessen
the
value
of
the
sacrifice
he
has
made
with
such
disinterested
generosity
if
a
man
would
get
through
life
honourably
and
peaceably
he
must
necessarily
learn
to
practise
in
small
things
as
well
as
great
men
have
to
bear
as
well
as
forbear
the
temper
has
to
be
held
in
subjection
to
the
judgment
and
the
little
demons
of
petulance
and
sarcasm
kept
resolutely
at
a
distance
if
once
they
find
an
entrance
to
the
mind
they
are
very
apt
to
return
and
to
establish
for
themselves
a
permanent
occupation
there
it
is
necessary
to
one
personal
happiness
to
exercise
control
over
one
words
as
well
as
acts
for
there
are
words
that
strike
even
harder
than
blows
and
men
may
speak
daggers
though
they
use
none
un
coup
de
langue
says
the
french
proverb
est
pire
coup
de
lance
the
stinging
repartee
that
rises
to
the
lips
and
which
if
uttered
might
cover
an
adversary
with
confusion
how
difficult
it
sometimes
is
to
resist
saying
it
heaven
keep
us
says
miss
bremer
in
her
from
the
destroying
power
of
words
there
are
words
which
sever
hearts
more
than
sharp
swords
do
there
are
words
the
point
of
which
sting
the
heart
through
the
course
of
a
whole
life
thus
character
exhibits
itself
in
of
speech
as
much
as
in
anything
else
the
wise
and
forbearant
man
will
restrain
his
desire
to
say
a
smart
or
severe
thing
at
the
expense
of
another
feelings
while
the
fool
blurts
out
what
he
thinks
and
will
sacrifice
his
friend
rather
than
his
joke
the
mouth
of
a
wise
man
said
solomon
is
in
his
heart
the
heart
of
a
fool
is
in
his
mouth
there
are
however
men
who
are
no
fools
that
are
headlong
in
their
language
as
in
their
acts
because
of
their
want
of
forbearance
and
patience
the
impulsive
genius
gifted
with
quick
thought
and
incisive
speech
perhaps
carried
away
by
the
cheers
of
the
moment
lets
fly
a
sarcastic
sentence
which
may
return
upon
him
to
his
own
infinite
damage
even
statesmen
might
be
named
who
have
failed
through
their
inability
to
resist
the
temptation
of
saying
clever
and
spiteful
things
at
their
adversary
expense
the
turn
of
a
sentence
says
bentham
has
decided
the
fate
of
many
a
friendship
and
for
aught
that
we
know
the
fate
of
many
a
kingdom
so
when
one
is
tempted
to
write
a
clever
but
harsh
thing
though
it
may
be
difficult
to
restrain
it
it
is
always
better
to
leave
it
in
the
inkstand
a
goose
quill
says
the
spanish
proverb
often
hurts
more
than
a
lion
claw
carlyle
says
when
speaking
of
oliver
cromwell
he
that
can
not
withal
keep
his
mind
to
himself
can
not
practise
any
considerable
thing
whatsoever
it
was
said
of
william
the
silent
by
one
of
his
greatest
enemies
that
an
arrogant
or
indiscreet
word
was
never
known
to
fall
from
his
lips
like
him
washington
was
discretion
itself
in
the
use
of
speech
never
taking
advantage
of
an
opponent
or
seeking
a
shortlived
triumph
in
a
debate
and
it
is
said
that
in
the
long
run
the
world
comes
round
to
and
supports
the
wise
man
who
knows
when
and
how
to
be
silent
we
have
heard
men
of
great
experience
say
that
they
have
often
regretted
having
spoken
but
never
once
regretted
holding
their
tongue
be
silent
says
pythagoras
or
say
something
better
than
silence
speak
fitly
says
george
herbert
or
be
silent
wisely
francis
de
sales
whom
leigh
hunt
styled
the
gentleman
saint
has
said
it
is
better
to
remain
silent
than
to
speak
the
truth
and
so
spoil
an
excellent
dish
by
covering
it
with
bad
sauce
another
frenchman
lacordaire
characteristically
puts
speech
first
and
silence
next
after
speech
he
says
silence
is
the
greatest
power
in
the
world
yet
a
word
spoken
in
season
how
powerful
it
may
be
as
the
old
welsh
proverb
has
it
a
golden
tongue
is
in
the
mouth
of
the
blessed
it
is
related
as
a
remarkable
instance
of
on
the
part
of
de
leon
a
distinguished
spanish
poet
of
the
sixteenth
century
who
lay
for
years
in
the
dungeons
of
the
inquisition
without
light
or
society
because
of
his
having
translated
a
part
of
the
scriptures
into
his
native
tongue
that
on
being
liberated
and
restored
to
his
professorship
an
immense
crowd
attended
his
first
lecture
expecting
some
account
of
his
long
imprisonment
but
do
leon
was
too
wise
and
too
gentle
to
indulge
in
recrimination
he
merely
resumed
the
lecture
which
five
years
before
had
been
so
sadly
interrupted
with
the
accustomed
formula
heri
dicebamus
and
went
directly
into
his
subject
there
are
of
course
times
and
occasions
when
the
expression
of
indignation
is
not
only
justifiable
but
necessary
we
are
bound
to
be
indignant
at
falsehood
selfishness
and
cruelty
a
man
of
true
feeling
fires
up
naturally
at
baseness
or
meanness
of
any
sort
even
in
cases
where
he
may
be
under
no
obligation
to
speak
out
i
would
have
nothing
to
do
said
perthes
with
the
man
who
can
not
be
moved
to
indignation
there
are
more
good
people
than
bad
in
the
world
and
the
bad
get
the
upper
hand
merely
because
they
are
bolder
we
can
not
help
being
pleased
with
a
man
who
uses
his
powers
with
decision
and
we
often
take
his
side
for
no
other
reason
than
because
he
does
so
use
them
no
doubt
i
have
often
repented
speaking
but
not
less
often
have
i
repented
keeping
silence
one
who
loves
right
can
not
be
indifferent
to
wrong
or
wrongdoing
if
he
feels
warmly
he
will
speak
warmly
out
of
the
fulness
of
his
heart
as
a
noble
lady
has
written
a
noble
heart
doth
teach
a
virtuous
scorn
to
scorn
to
owe
a
duty
overlong
to
scorn
to
be
for
benefits
forborne
to
scorn
to
lie
to
scorn
to
do
a
wrong
to
scorn
to
bear
an
injury
in
mind
to
scorn
a
freeborn
heart
to
bind
we
have
however
to
be
on
our
guard
against
impatient
scorn
the
best
people
are
apt
to
have
their
impatient
side
and
often
the
very
temper
which
makes
men
earnest
makes
them
also
intolerant
of
all
mental
gifts
says
miss
julia
wedgwood
the
rarest
is
intellectual
patience
and
the
last
lesson
of
culture
is
to
believe
in
difficulties
which
are
invisible
to
ourselves
the
best
corrective
of
intolerance
in
disposition
is
increase
of
wisdom
and
enlarged
experience
of
life
cultivated
good
sense
will
usually
save
men
from
the
entanglements
in
which
moral
impatience
is
apt
to
involve
them
good
sense
consisting
chiefly
in
that
temper
of
mind
which
enables
its
possessor
to
deal
with
the
practical
affairs
of
life
with
justice
judgment
discretion
and
charity
hence
men
of
culture
and
experience
are
invariably
found
the
most
forbearant
and
tolerant
as
ignorant
and
narrowminded
persons
are
found
the
most
unforgiving
and
intolerant
men
of
large
and
generous
natures
in
proportion
to
their
practical
wisdom
are
disposed
to
make
allowance
for
the
defects
and
disadvantages
of
others
allowance
for
the
controlling
power
of
circumstances
in
the
formation
of
character
and
the
limited
power
of
resistance
of
weak
and
fallible
natures
to
temptation
and
error
i
see
no
fault
committed
said
goethe
which
i
also
might
not
have
committed
so
a
wise
and
good
man
exclaimed
when
he
saw
a
criminal
drawn
on
his
hurdle
to
tyburn
there
goes
jonathan
bradford
but
for
the
grace
of
god
life
will
always
be
to
a
great
extent
what
we
ourselves
make
it
the
cheerful
man
makes
a
cheerful
world
the
gloomy
man
a
gloomy
one
we
usually
find
but
our
own
temperament
reflected
in
the
dispositions
of
those
about
us
if
we
are
ourselves
querulous
we
will
find
them
so
if
we
are
unforgiving
and
uncharitable
to
them
they
will
be
the
same
to
us
a
person
returning
from
an
evening
party
not
long
ago
complained
to
a
policeman
on
his
beat
that
an
fellow
was
following
him
it
turned
out
to
be
only
his
own
shadow
and
such
usually
is
human
life
to
each
of
us
it
is
for
the
most
part
but
the
reflection
of
ourselves
if
we
would
be
at
peace
with
others
and
ensure
their
respect
we
must
have
regard
for
their
personality
every
man
has
his
peculiarities
of
manner
and
character
as
he
has
peculiarities
of
form
and
feature
and
we
must
have
forbearance
in
dealing
with
them
as
we
expect
them
to
have
forbearance
in
dealing
with
us
we
may
not
be
conscious
of
our
own
peculiarities
yet
they
exist
nevertheless
there
is
a
village
in
south
america
where
gotos
or
goitres
are
so
common
that
to
be
without
one
is
regarded
as
a
deformity
one
day
a
party
of
englishmen
passed
through
the
place
when
quite
a
crowd
collected
to
jeer
them
shouting
see
see
these
people
they
have
got
no
gotos
many
persons
give
themselves
a
great
deal
of
fidget
concerning
what
other
people
think
of
them
and
their
peculiarities
some
are
too
much
disposed
to
take
the
illnatured
side
and
judging
by
themselves
infer
the
worst
but
it
is
very
often
the
case
that
the
uncharitableness
of
others
where
it
really
exists
is
but
the
reflection
of
our
own
want
of
charity
and
want
of
temper
it
still
oftener
happens
that
the
worry
we
subject
ourselves
to
has
its
source
in
our
own
imagination
and
even
though
those
about
us
may
think
of
us
uncharitably
we
shall
not
mend
matters
by
exasperating
ourselves
against
them
we
may
thereby
only
expose
ourselves
unnecessarily
to
their
illnature
or
caprice
the
ill
that
comes
out
of
our
mouth
says
herbert
ofttimes
falls
into
our
bosom
the
great
and
good
philosopher
faraday
communicated
the
following
piece
of
admirable
advice
full
of
practical
wisdom
the
result
of
a
rich
experience
of
life
in
a
letter
to
his
friend
professor
tyndall
let
me
as
an
old
man
who
ought
by
this
time
to
have
profited
by
experience
say
that
when
i
was
younger
i
found
i
often
misrepresented
the
intentions
of
people
and
that
they
did
not
mean
what
at
the
time
i
supposed
they
meant
and
further
that
as
a
general
rule
it
was
better
to
be
a
little
dull
of
apprehension
where
phrases
seemed
to
imply
pique
and
quick
in
perception
when
on
the
contrary
they
seemed
to
imply
kindly
feeling
the
real
truth
never
fails
ultimately
to
appear
and
opposing
parties
if
wrong
are
sooner
convinced
when
replied
to
forbearingly
than
when
overwhelmed
all
i
mean
to
say
is
that
it
is
better
to
be
blind
to
the
results
of
partisanship
and
quick
to
see
goodwill
one
has
more
happiness
in
one
self
in
endeavouring
to
follow
the
things
that
make
for
peace
you
can
hardly
imagine
how
often
i
have
been
heated
in
private
when
opposed
as
i
have
thought
unjustly
and
superciliously
and
yet
i
have
striven
and
succeeded
i
hope
in
keeping
down
replies
of
the
like
kind
and
i
know
i
have
never
lost
by
it
while
the
painter
barry
was
at
rome
he
involved
himself
as
was
his
wont
in
furious
quarrels
with
the
artists
and
dilettanti
about
and
upon
which
his
friend
and
countryman
edmund
burke
always
the
generous
friend
of
struggling
merit
wrote
to
him
kindly
and
sensibly
believe
me
dear
barry
that
the
arms
with
which
the
of
the
world
are
to
be
combated
and
the
qualities
by
which
it
is
to
be
reconciled
to
us
and
we
reconciled
to
it
are
moderation
gentleness
a
little
indulgence
to
others
and
a
great
deal
of
distrust
of
ourselves
which
are
not
qualities
of
a
mean
spirit
as
some
may
possibly
think
them
but
virtues
of
a
great
and
noble
kind
and
such
as
dignify
our
nature
as
much
as
they
contribute
to
our
repose
and
fortune
for
nothing
can
be
so
unworthy
of
a
soul
as
to
pass
away
life
in
bickerings
and
litigations
in
snarling
and
scuffling
with
every
one
about
us
we
must
be
at
peace
with
our
species
if
not
for
their
sakes
at
least
very
much
for
our
own
no
one
knew
the
value
of
better
than
the
poet
burns
and
no
one
could
teach
it
more
eloquently
to
others
but
when
it
came
to
practice
burns
was
as
weak
as
the
weakest
he
could
not
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
uttering
a
harsh
and
clever
sarcasm
at
expense
one
of
his
biographers
observes
of
him
that
it
was
no
extravagant
arithmetic
to
say
that
for
every
ten
jokes
he
made
himself
a
hundred
enemies
but
this
was
not
all
poor
burns
exercised
no
control
over
his
appetites
but
freely
gave
them
rein
thus
thoughtless
follies
laid
him
low
and
stained
his
name
nor
had
he
the
to
resist
giving
publicity
to
compositions
originally
intended
for
the
delight
of
the
but
which
continue
secretly
to
sow
pollution
broadcast
in
the
minds
of
youth
indeed
notwithstanding
the
many
exquisite
poems
of
this
writer
it
is
not
saying
too
much
to
aver
that
his
immoral
writings
have
done
far
more
harm
than
his
purer
writings
have
done
good
and
that
it
would
be
better
that
all
his
writings
should
be
destroyed
and
forgotten
provided
his
indecent
songs
could
be
destroyed
with
them
the
remark
applies
alike
to
beranger
who
has
been
styled
the
burns
of
france
beranger
was
of
the
same
bright
incisive
genius
he
had
the
same
love
of
pleasure
the
same
love
of
popularity
and
while
he
flattered
french
vanity
to
the
top
of
its
bent
he
also
painted
the
vices
most
loved
by
his
countrymen
with
the
pen
of
a
master
songs
and
thiers
history
probably
did
more
than
anything
else
to
reestablish
the
napoleonic
dynasty
in
france
but
that
was
a
small
evil
compared
with
the
moral
mischief
which
many
of
beranger
songs
are
calculated
to
produce
for
circulating
freely
as
they
do
in
french
households
they
exhibit
pictures
of
nastiness
and
vice
which
are
enough
to
pollute
and
destroy
a
nation
one

finest
poems
written
in
his
year

entitled

is
a
description

his

wordsworth

wisdom
root
one
of
the
vices
before
which
burns
fell
and
it
may
be
said
to
be
a
because
it
is
productive
of
so
many
other
vices
was
drinking
not
that
he
was
a
drunkard
but
because
he
yielded
to
the
temptations
of
drink
with
its
degrading
associations
and
thereby
lowered
and
depraved
his
whole
nature
but
poor
burns
did
not
stand
alone
for
alas
of
all
vices
the
unrestrained
appetite
for
drink
was
in
his
time
as
it
continues
to
be
now
the
most
prevalent
popular
degrading
and
destructive
were
it
possible
to
conceive
the
existence
of
a
tyrant
who
should
compel
his
people
to
give
up
to
him
or
more
of
their
earnings
and
require
them
at
the
same
time
to
consume
a
commodity
that
should
brutalise
and
degrade
them
destroy
the
peace
and
comfort
of
their
families
and
sow
in
themselves
the
seeds
of
disease
and
premature
death
what
indignation
meetings
what
monster
processions
there
would
be
eloquent
speeches
and
apostrophes
to
the
spirit
of
liberty
what
appeals
against
a
despotism
so
monstrous
and
so
unnatural
and
yet
such
a
tyrant
really
exists
amongst
us
the
tyrant
of
unrestrained
appetite
whom
no
force
of
arms
or
voices
or
votes
can
resist
while
men
are
willing
to
be
his
slaves
the
power
of
this
tyrant
can
only
be
overcome
by
moral
means
by
and
there
is
no
other
way
of
withstanding
the
despotism
of
appetite
in
any
of
its
forms
no
reform
of
institutions
no
extended
power
of
voting
no
improved
form
of
government
no
amount
of
scholastic
instruction
can
possibly
elevate
the
character
of
a
people
who
voluntarily
abandon
themselves
to
sensual
indulgence
the
pursuit
of
ignoble
pleasure
is
the
degradation
of
true
happiness
it
saps
the
morals
destroys
the
energies
and
degrades
the
manliness
and
robustness
of
individuals
as
of
nations
the
courage
of
exhibits
itself
in
many
ways
but
in
none
more
clearly
than
in
honest
living
men
without
the
virtue
of
are
not
only
subject
to
their
own
selfish
desires
but
they
are
usually
in
bondage
to
others
who
are
likeminded
with
themselves
what
others
do
they
do
they
must
live
according
to
the
artificial
standard
of
their
class
spending
like
their
neighbours
regardless
of
the
consequences
at
the
same
time
that
all
are
perhaps
aspiring
after
a
style
of
living
higher
than
their
means
each
carries
the
others
along
with
him
and
they
have
not
the
moral
courage
to
stop
they
can
not
resist
the
temptation
of
living
high
though
it
may
be
at
the
expense
of
others
and
they
gradually
become
reckless
of
debt
until
it
enthrals
them
in
all
this
there
is
great
moral
cowardice
pusillanimity
and
want
of
manly
independence
of
character
a
rightminded
man
will
shrink
from
seeming
to
be
what
he
is
not
or
pretending
to
be
richer
than
he
really
is
or
assuming
a
style
of
living
that
his
circumstances
will
not
justify
he
will
have
the
courage
to
live
honestly
within
his
own
means
rather
than
dishonestly
upon
the
means
of
other
people
for
he
who
incurs
debts
in
striving
to
maintain
a
style
of
living
beyond
his
income
is
in
spirit
as
dishonest
as
the
man
who
openly
picks
your
pocket
to
many
this
may
seem
an
extreme
view
but
it
will
bear
the
strictest
test
living
at
the
cost
of
others
is
not
only
dishonesty
but
it
is
untruthfulness
in
deed
as
lying
is
in
word
the
proverb
of
george
herbert
that
debtors
are
liars
is
justified
by
experience
shaftesbury
somewhere
says
that
a
restlessness
to
have
something
which
we
have
not
and
to
be
something
which
we
are
not
is
the
root
of
all
immorality
no
reliance
is
to
be
placed
on
the
saying
a
very
dangerous
one
of
mirabeau
that
la
petite
morale
etait
de
la
grande
on
the
contrary
strict
adherence
to
even
the
smallest
details
of
morality
is
the
foundation
of
all
manly
and
noble
character
the
honourable
man
is
frugal
of
his
means
and
pays
his
way
honestly
he
does
not
seek
to
pass
himself
off
as
richer
than
he
is
or
by
running
into
debt
open
an
account
with
ruin
as
that
man
is
not
poor
whose
means
are
small
but
whose
desires
are
uncontrolled
so
that
man
is
rich
whose
means
are
more
than
sufficient
for
his
wants
when
socrates
saw
a
great
quantity
of
riches
jewels
and
furniture
of
great
value
carried
in
pomp
through
athens
he
said
now
do
i
see
how
many
things
i
do
not
desire
i
can
forgive
everything
but
selfishness
said
perthes
even
the
narrowest
circumstances
admit
of
greatness
with
reference
to
and
thine
and
none
but
the
very
poorest
need
fill
their
daily
life
with
thoughts
of
money
if
they
have
but
prudence
to
arrange
their
housekeeping
within
the
limits
of
their
income
a
man
may
be
indifferent
to
money
because
of
higher
considerations
as
faraday
was
who
sacrificed
wealth
to
pursue
science
but
if
he
would
have
the
enjoyments
that
money
can
purchase
he
must
honestly
earn
it
and
not
live
upon
the
earnings
of
others
as
those
do
who
habitually
incur
debts
which
they
have
no
means
of
paying
when
maginn
always
drowned
in
debt
was
asked
what
he
paid
for
his
wine
he
replied
that
he
did
not
know
but
he
believed
they
put
something
down
in
a
book
this
in
a
book
has
proved
the
ruin
of
a
great
many
weakminded
people
who
can
not
resist
the
temptation
of
taking
things
upon
credit
which
they
have
not
the
present
means
of
paying
for
and
it
would
probably
prove
of
great
social
benefit
if
the
law
which
enables
creditors
to
recover
debts
contracted
under
certain
circumstances
were
altogether
abolished
but
in
the
competition
for
trade
every
encouragement
is
given
to
the
incurring
of
debt
the
creditor
relying
upon
the
law
to
aid
him
in
the
last
extremity
when
sydney
smith
once
went
into
a
new
neighbourhood
it
was
given
out
in
the
local
papers
that
he
was
a
man
of
high
connections
and
he
was
besought
on
all
sides
for
his
custom
but
he
speedily
undeceived
his
new
neighbours
we
are
not
great
people
at
all
he
said
we
are
only
common
honest
people
people
that
pay
our
debts
hazlitt
who
was
a
thoroughly
honest
though
rather
thriftless
man
speaks
of
two
classes
of
persons
not
unlike
each
other
those
who
can
not
keep
their
own
money
in
their
hands
and
those
who
can
not
keep
their
hands
from
other
people
the
former
are
always
in
want
of
money
for
they
throw
it
away
on
any
object
that
first
presents
itself
as
if
to
get
rid
of
it
the
latter
make
away
with
what
they
have
of
their
own
and
are
perpetual
borrowers
from
all
who
will
lend
to
them
and
their
genius
for
borrowing
in
the
long
run
usually
proves
their
ruin
sheridan
was
one
of
such
eminent
unfortunates
he
was
impulsive
and
careless
in
his
expenditure
borrowing
money
and
running
into
debt
with
everybody
who
would
trust
him
when
he
stood
for
westminster
his
unpopularity
arose
chiefly
from
his
general
indebtedness
numbers
of
poor
people
says
lord
palmerston
in
one
of
his
letters
crowded
round
the
hustings
demanding
payment
for
the
bills
he
owed
them
in
the
midst
of
all
his
difficulties
sheridan
was
as
lighthearted
as
ever
and
cracked
many
a
good
joke
at
his
creditors
expense
lord
palmerston
was
actually
present
at
the
dinner
given
by
him
at
which
the
sheriff
in
possession
were
dressed
up
and
officiated
as
waiters
yet
however
loose
sheridan
morality
may
have
been
as
regarded
his
private
creditors
he
was
honest
so
far
as
the
public
money
was
concerned
once
at
dinner
at
which
lord
byron
happened
to
be
present
an
observation
happened
to
be
made
as
to
the
sturdiness
of
the
whigs
in
resisting
office
and
keeping
to
their
principles
on
which
sheridan
turned
sharply
and
said
sir
it
is
easy
for
my
lord
this
or
earl
that
or
the
marquis
of
with
thousands
upon
thousands
a
year
some
of
it
either
presently
derived
or
inherited
in
sinecure
or
acquisitions
from
the
public
money
to
boast
of
their
patriotism
and
keep
aloof
from
temptation
but
they
do
not
know
from
what
temptation
those
have
kept
aloof
who
had
equal
pride
at
least
equal
talents
and
not
unequal
passions
and
nevertheless
knew
not
in
the
course
of
their
lives
what
it
was
to
have
a
shilling
of
their
own
and
lord
byron
adds
that
in
saying
this
sheridan
wept
the
tone
of
public
morality
in
was
very
low
in
those
days
political
peculation
was
not
thought
discreditable
and
heads
of
parties
did
not
hesitate
to
secure
the
adhesion
of
their
followers
by
a
free
use
of
the
public
money
they
were
generous
but
at
the
expense
of
others
like
that
great
local
magnate
who
out
of
his
great
bounty
built
a
bridge
at
the
expense
of
the
county
when
lord
cornwallis
was
appointed
of
ireland
he
pressed
upon
colonel
napier
the
father
of

honest
man
and
this
is
the
only
thing
i
have
been
able
to
wrest
from
the
harpies
around
me
it
is
said
that
lord
chatham
was
the
first
to
set
the
example
of
disdaining
to
govern
by
petty
larceny
and
his
great
son
was
alike
honest
in
his
administration
while
millions
of
money
were
passing
through
pitt
hands
he
himself
was
never
otherwise
than
poor
and
he
died
poor
of
all
his
rancorous
libellers
not
one
ever
ventured
to
call
in
question
his
honesty
in
former
times
the
profits
of
office
were
sometimes
enormous
when
audley
the
famous
of
the
sixteenth
century
was
asked
the
value
of
an
office
which
he
had
purchased
in
the
court
of
wards
he
replied
some
thousands
to
any
one
who
wishes
to
get
to
heaven
immediately
twice
as
much
to
him
who
does
not
mind
being
in
purgatory
and
nobody
knows
what
to
him
who
is
not
afraid
of
the
devil
sir
walter
scott
was
a
man
who
was
honest
to
the
core
of
his
nature
and
his
strenuous
and
determined
efforts
to
pay
his
debts
or
rather
the
debts
of
the
firm
with
which
he
had
become
involved
has
always
appeared
to
us
one
of
the
grandest
things
in
biography
when
his
publisher
and
printer
broke
down
ruin
seemed
to
stare
him
in
the
face
there
was
no
want
of
sympathy
for
him
in
his
great
misfortune
and
friends
came
forward
who
offered
to
raise
money
enough
to
enable
him
to
arrange
with
his
creditors
no
said
he
proudly
this
right
hand
shall
work
it
all
off
if
we
lose
everything
else
he
wrote
to
a
friend
we
will
at
least
keep
our
honour
unblemished
while
his
health
was
already
becoming
undermined
by
overwork
he
went
on
writing
like
a
tiger
as
he
himself
expressed
it
until
no
longer
able
to
wield
a
pen
and
though
he
paid
the
penalty
of
his
supreme
efforts
with
his
life
he
nevertheless
saved
his
honour
and
his
everybody
knows
bow
scott
threw
off
the
of
napoleon
he
thought
would
be
his
death
articles
for
the
of
the
canongate
miscellanies
and
of
a
grandfather
all
written
in
the
midst
of
pain
sorrow
and
ruin
the
proceeds
of
those
various
works
went
to
his
creditors
i
could
not
have
slept
sound
he
wrote
as
i
now
can
under
the
comfortable
impression
of
receiving
the
thanks
of
my
creditors
and
the
conscious
feeling
of
discharging
my
duty
as
a
man
of
honour
and
honesty
i
see
before
me
a
long
tedious
and
dark
path
but
it
leads
to
stainless
reputation
if
i
die
in
the
harrows
as
is
very
likely
i
shall
die
with
honour
if
i
achieve
my
task
i
shall
have
the
thanks
of
all
concerned
and
the
approbation
of
my
own
conscience
and
then
followed
more
articles
memoirs
and
even
sermons
fair

of
perth
a
completely
revised
edition
of
his
novels
of
geierstein
and
more
of
a
grandfather
until
he
was
suddenly
struck
down
by
paralysis
but
he
had
no
sooner
recovered
sufficient
strength
to
be
able
to
hold
a
pen
than
we
find
him
again
at
his
desk
writing
the
on
demonology
and
witchcraft
a
volume
of
scottish
history
for
cyclopaedia
and
a
fourth
series
of
of
a
grandfather
in
his
french
history
in
vain
his
doctors
told
him
to
give
up
work
he
would
not
be
dissuaded
as
for
bidding
me
not
work
he
said
to
abercrombie
molly
might
just
as
well
put
the
kettle
on
the
fire
and
say
kettle
do
boil
to
which
he
added
if
i
were
to
be
idle
i
should
go
mad
by
means
of
the
profits
realised
by
these
tremendous
efforts
scott
saw
his
debts
in
course
of
rapid
diminution
and
he
trusted
that
after
a
few
more
years
work
he
would
again
be
a
free
man
but
it
was
not
to
be
he
went
on
turning
out
such
works
as
his
robert
of
with
greatly
impaired
skill
until
he
was
prostrated
by
another
and
severer
attack
of
palsy
he
now
felt
that
the
plough
was
nearing
the
end
of
the
furrow
his
physical
strength
was
gone
he
was
not
quite
himself
in
all
things
and
yet
his
courage
and
perseverance
never
failed
i
have
suffered
terribly
he
wrote
in
his
diary
though
rather
in
body
than
in
mind
and
i
often
wish
i
could
lie
down
and
sleep
without
waking
but
i
will
fight
it
out
if
i
can
he
again
recovered
sufficiently
to
be
able
to
write
dangerous
though
the
cunning
of
the
workman
hand
had
departed
and
then
there
was
his
last
tour
to
italy
in
search
of
rest
and
health
during
which
while
at
naples
in
spite
of
all
remonstrances
he
gave
several
hours
every
morning
to
the
composition
of
a
new
novel
which
however
has
not
seen
the
light
scott
returned
to
abbotsford
to
die
i
have
seen
much
he
said
on
his
return
but
nothing
like
my
own
house
give
me
one
turn
more
one
of
the
last
things
he
uttered
in
one
of
his
lucid
intervals
was
worthy
of
him
i
have
been
he
said
perhaps
the
most
voluminous
author
of
my
day
and
it
is
a
comfort
to
me
to
think
that
i
have
tried
to
unsettle
no
man
faith
to
corrupt
no
man
principles
and
that
i
have
written
nothing
which
on
my
deathbed
i
should
wish
blotted
out
his
last
injunction
to
his
was
lockhart
i
may
have
but
a
minute
to
speak
to
you
my
dear
be
virtuous
be
religious
be
a
good
man
nothing
else
will
give
you
any
comfort
when
you
come
to
lie
here
the
devoted
conduct
of
lockhart
himself
was
worthy
of
his
great
relative
the
of
scott
which
he
afterwards
wrote
occupied
him
several
years
and
was
a
remarkably
successful
work
yet
he
himself
derived
no
pecuniary
advantage
from
it
handing
over
the
profits
of
the
whole
undertaking
to
sir
walter
creditors
in
payment
of
debts
which
he
was
in
no
way
responsible
but
influenced
entirely
by
a
spirit
of
honour
of
regard
for
the
memory
of
the
illustrious

that
workest
neither
by

nor
by
any

but
merely
by
holding
up
thy

so
extorting
for

always

not
always
obedience
before

this

duty
is
a
thing
that
is
due
and
must
be
paid
by
every
man
who
would
avoid
present
discredit
and
eventual
moral
insolvency
it
is
an
obligation
a
debt
which
can
only
be
discharged
by
voluntary
effort
and
resolute
action
in
the
affairs
of
life
duty
embraces
man
whole
existence
it
begins
in
the
home
where
there
is
the
duty
which
children
owe
to
their
parents
on
the
one
hand
and
the
duty
which
parents
owe
to
their
children
on
the
other
there
are
in
like
manner
the
respective
duties
of
husbands
and
wives
of
masters
and
servants
while
outside
the
home
there
are
the
duties
which
men
and
women
owe
to
each
other
as
friends
and
neighbours
as
employers
and
employed
as
governors
and
governed
render

says
paul
to
all
their

to
whom
tribute
is
due
custom
to
whom

to
whom

honour
to
whom
honour
owe
no
man
anything
but
to
love
one
another
for
he
that
loveth
another
hath
fulfilled
the
law
thus
duty
rounds
the
whole
of
life
from
our
entrance
into
it
until
our
exit
from
it
duty
to
superiors
duty
to
inferiors
and
duty
to
equals
duty
to
man
and
duty
to
god
wherever
there
is
power
to
use
or
to
direct
there
is
duty
for
we
are
but
as
stewards
appointed
to
employ
the
means
entrusted
to
us
for
our
own
and
for
others
good
the
abiding
sense
of
duty
is
the
very
crown
of
character
it
is
the
upholding
law
of
man
in
his
highest
attitudes
without
it
the
individual
totters
and
falls
before
the
first
puff
of
adversity
or
temptation
whereas
inspired
by
it
the
weakest
becomes
strong
and
full
of
courage
duty
says
jameson
is
the
cement
which
binds
the
whole
moral
edifice
together
without
which
all
power
goodness
intellect
truth
happiness
love
itself
can
have
no
permanence
but
all
the
fabric
of
existence
crumbles
away
from
under
us
and
leaves
us
at
last
sitting
in
the
midst
of
a
ruin
astonished
at
our
own
desolation
duty
is
based
upon
a
sense
of
justice
justice
inspired
by
love
which
is
the
most
perfect
form
of
goodness
duty
is
not
a
sentiment
but
a
principle
pervading
the
life
and
it
exhibits
itself
in
conduct
and
in
acts
which
are
mainly
determined
by
man
conscience
and
freewill
the
voice
of
conscience
speaks
in
duty
done
and
without
its
regulating
and
controlling
influence
the
brightest
and
greatest
intellect
may
be
merely
as
a
light
that
leads
astray
conscience
sets
a
man
upon
his
feet
while
his
will
holds
him
upright
conscience
is
the
moral
governor
of
the
heart
the
governor
of
right
action
of
right
thought
of
right
faith
of
right
life
and
only
through
its
dominating
influence
can
the
noble
and
upright
character
be
fully
developed
the
conscience
however
may
speak
never
so
loudly
but
without
energetic
will
it
may
speak
in
vain
the
will
is
free
to
choose
between
the
right
course
and
the
wrong
one
but
the
choice
is
nothing
unless
followed
by
immediate
and
decisive
action
if
the
sense
of
duty
be
strong
and
the
course
of
action
clear
the
courageous
will
upheld
by
the
conscience
enables
a
man
to
proceed
on
his
course
bravely
and
to
accomplish
his
purposes
in
the
face
of
all
opposition
and
difficulty
and
should
failure
be
the
issue
there
will
remain
at
least
this
satisfaction
that
it
has
been
in
the
cause
of
duty
be
and
continue
poor
young
man
said
heinzelmann
while
others
around
you
grow
rich
by
fraud
and
disloyalty
be
without
place
or
power
while
others
beg
their
way
upwards
bear
the
pain
of
disappointed
hopes
while
others
gain
the
accomplishment
of
theirs
by
flattery
forego
the
gracious
pressure
of
the
hand
for
which
others
cringe
and
crawl
wrap
yourself
in
your
own
virtue
and
seek
a
friend
and
your
daily
bread
if
you
have
in
your
own
cause
grown
gray
with
unbleached
honour
bless
god
and
die
men
inspired
by
high
principles
are
often
required
to
sacrifice
all
that
they
esteem
and
love
rather
than
fail
in
their
duty
the
old
english
idea
of
this
sublime
devotion
to
duty
was
expressed
by
the
loyalist
poet
to
his
sweetheart
on
taking
up
arms
for
his
sovereign
i
could
love
thee
dear
so
much
loved
i
not
honour
more
and
sertorius
has
said
the
man
who
has
any
dignity
of
character
should
conquer
with
honour
and
not
use
any
base
means
even
to
save
his
life
so
paul
inspired
by
duty
and
faith
declared
himself
as
not
only
ready
to
be
bound
but
to
die
at
jerusalem
when
the
marquis
of
pescara
was
entreated
by
the
princes
of
italy
to
desert
the
spanish
cause
to
which
he
was
in
honour
bound
his
noble
wife
vittoria
colonna
reminded
him
of
his
duty
she
wrote
to
him
remember
your
honour
which
raises
you
above
fortune
and
above
kings
by
that
alone
and
not
by
the
splendour
of
titles
is
glory
acquired
that
glory
which
it
will
be
your
happiness
and
pride
to
transmit
unspotted
to
your
posterity
such
was
the
dignified
view
which
she
took
of
her
husband
honour
and
when
he
fell
at
pavia
though
young
and
beautiful
and
besought
by
many
admirers
she
betook
herself
to
solitude
that
she
might
lament
over
her
husband
loss
and
celebrate
his
exploits
to
live
really
is
to
act
energetically
life
is
a
battle
to
be
fought
valiantly
inspired
by
high
and
honourable
resolve
a
man
must
stand
to
his
post
and
die
there
if
need
be
like
the
old
danish
hero
his
determination
should
be
to
dare
nobly
to
will
strongly
and
never
to
falter
in
the
path
of
duty
the
power
of
will
be
it
great
or
small
which
god
has
given
us
is
a
divine
gift
and
we
ought
neither
to
let
it
perish
for
want
of
using
on
the
one
hand
nor
profane
it
by
employing
it
for
ignoble
purposes
on
the
other
robertson
of
brighton
has
truly
said
that
man
real
greatness
consists
not
in
seeking
his
own
pleasure
or
fame
or
advancement
not
that
every
one
shall
save
his
own
life
not
that
every
man
shall
seek
his
own
glory
but
that
every
man
shall
do
his
own
duty
what
most
stands
in
the
way
of
the
performance
of
duty
is
irresolution
weakness
of
purpose
and
indecision
on
the
one
side
are
conscience
and
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
on
the
other
are
indolence
selfishness
love
of
pleasure
or
passion
the
weak
and
will
may
remain
suspended
for
a
time
between
these
influences
but
at
length
the
balance
inclines
one
way
or
the
other
according
as
the
will
is
called
into
action
or
otherwise
if
it
be
allowed
to
remain
passive
the
lower
influence
of
selfishness
or
passion
will
prevail
and
thus
manhood
suffers
abdication
individuality
is
renounced
character
is
degraded
and
the
man
permits
himself
to
become
the
mere
passive
slave
of
his
senses
thus
the
power
of
exercising
the
will
promptly
in
obedience
to
the
dictates
of
conscience
and
thereby
resisting
the
impulses
of
the
lower
nature
is
of
essential
importance
in
moral
discipline
and
absolutely
necessary
for
the
development
of
character
in
its
best
forms
to
acquire
the
habit
of
to
resist
evil
propensities
to
fight
against
sensual
desires
to
overcome
inborn
selfishness
may
require
a
long
and
persevering
discipline
but
when
once
the
practice
of
duty
is
learnt
it
becomes
consolidated
in
habit
and
is
comparatively
easy
the
valiant
good
man
is
he
who
by
the
resolute
exercise
of
his
freewill
has
so
disciplined
himself
as
to
have
acquired
the
habit
of
virtue
as
the
bad
man
is
he
who
by
allowing
his
freewill
to
remain
inactive
and
giving
the
bridle
to
his
desires
and
passions
has
acquired
the
habit
of
vice
by
which
he
becomes
at
last
bound
as
by
chains
of
iron
a
man
can
only
achieve
strength
of
purpose
by
the
action
of
his
own
freewill
if
he
is
to
stand
erect
it
must
be
by
his
own
efforts
for
he
can
not
be
kept
propped
up
by
the
help
of
others
he
is
master
of
himself
and
of
his
actions
he
can
avoid
falsehood
and
be
truthful
he
can
shun
sensualism
and
be
continent
he
can
turn
aside
from
doing
a
cruel
thing
and
be
benevolent
and
forgiving
all
these
lie
within
the
sphere
of
individual
efforts
and
come
within
the
range
of
and
it
depends
upon
men
themselves
whether
in
these
respects
they
will
be
free
pure
and
good
on
the
one
hand
or
enslaved
impure
and
miserable
on
the
other
among
the
wise
sayings
of
epictetus
we
find
the
following
we
do
not
choose
our
own
parts
in
life
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
those
parts
our
simple
duty
is
confined
to
playing
them
well
the
slave
may
be
as
free
as
the
consul
and
freedom
is
the

it
dwarfs
all
others
beside
it
all
others
are
insignificant
with
it
all
others
are
needless
without
it
no
others
are

you
must
teach
men
that
happiness
is
not
where
in
their
blindness
and
misery
they
seek
it
it
is
not
in
strength
for
myro
and
ofellius
were

not

for

was

sighed
and

and

and
were
the

and
the
dupes

it

in

in

freedom
in
the
absence
or
conquest
of
every
ignoble
fear
in

and
in

of

and
peace
and
the
even
flow
of
life
amid
poverty
exile
disease
and
the
very
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
the
sense
of
duty
is
a
sustaining
power
even
to
a
courageous
man
it
holds
him
upright
and
makes
him
strong
it
was
a
noble
saying
of
pompey
when
his
friends
tried
to
dissuade
him
from
embarking
for
rome
in
a
storm
telling
him
that
he
did
so
at
the
great
peril
of
his
life
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
go
he
said
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
live
what
it
was
right
that
he
should
do
he
would
do
in
the
face
of
danger
and
in
defiance
of
storms
as
might
be
expected
of
the
great
washington
the
chief
motive
power
in
his
life
was
the
spirit
of
duty
it
was
the
regal
and
commanding
element
in
his
character
which
gave
it
unity
compactness
and
vigour
when
he
clearly
saw
his
duty
before
him
he
did
it
at
all
hazards
and
with
inflexible
integrity
he
did
not
do
it
for
effect
nor
did
he
think
of
glory
or
of
fame
and
its
rewards
but
of
the
right
thing
to
be
done
and
the
best
way
of
doing
it
yet
washington
had
a
most
modest
opinion
of
himself
and
when
offered
the
chief
command
of
the
american
patriot
army
he
hesitated
to
accept
it
until
it
was
pressed
upon
him
when
acknowledging
in
congress
the
honour
which
had
been
done
him
in
selecting
him
to
so
important
a
trust
on
the
execution
of
which
the
future
of
his
country
in
a
great
measure
depended
washington
said
i
beg
it
may
be
remembered
lest
some
unlucky
event
should
happen
unfavourable
to
my
reputation
that
i
this
day
declare
with
the
utmost
sincerity
i
do
not
think
myself
equal
to
the
command
i
am
honoured
with
and
in
his
letter
to
his
wife
communicating
to
her
his
appointment
as
he
said
i
have
used
every
endeavour
in
my
power
to
avoid
it
not
only
from
my
unwillingness
to
part
with
you
and
the
family
but
from
a
consciousness
of
its
being
a
trust
too
great
for
my
capacity
and
that
i
should
enjoy
more
real
happiness
in
one
month
with
you
at
home
than
i
have
the
most
distant
prospect
of
finding
abroad
if
my
stay
were
to
be
seven
times
seven
years
but
as
it
has
been
a
kind
of
destiny
that
has
thrown
me
upon
this
service
i
shall
hope
that
my
undertaking
it
is
designed
for
some
good
purpose
it
was
utterly
out
of
my
power
to
refuse
the
appointment
without
exposing
my
character
to
such
censures
as
would
have
reflected
dishonour
upon
myself
and
given
pain
to
my
friends
this
i
am
sure
could
not
and
ought
not
to
be
pleasing
to
you
and
must
have
lessened
me
considerably
in
my
own
esteem
washington
pursued
his
upright
course
through
life
first
as
and
afterwards
as
president
never
faltering
in
the
path
of
duty
he
had
no
regard
for
popularity
but
held
to
his
purpose
through
good
and
through
evil
report
often
at
the
risk
of
his
power
and
influence
thus
on
one
occasion
when
the
ratification
of
a
treaty
arranged
by
jay
with
great
britain
was
in
question
washington
was
urged
to
reject
it
but
his
honour
and
the
honour
of
his
country
was
committed
and
he
refused
to
do
so
a
great
outcry
was
raised
against
the
treaty
and
for
a
time
washington
was
so
unpopular
that
he
is
said
to
have
been
actually
stoned
by
the
mob
but
he
nevertheless
held
it
to
be
his
duty
to
ratify
the
treaty
and
it
was
carried
out
in
despite
of
petitions
and
remonstrances
from
all
quarters
while
i
feel
he
said
in
answer
to
the
remonstrants
the
most
lively
gratitude
for
the
many
instances
of
approbation
from
my
country
i
can
no
otherwise
deserve
it
than
by
obeying
the
dictates
of
my
conscience
watchword
like
washington
was
duty
and
no
man
could
be
more
loyal
to
it
than
he
was
there
is
little
or
nothing
he
once
said
in
this
life
worth
living
for
but
we
can
all
of
us
go
straight
forward
and
do
our
duty
none
recognised
more
cheerfully
than
he
did
the
duty
of
obedience
and
willing
service
for
unless
men
can
serve
faithfully
they
will
not
rule
others
wisely
there
is
no
motto
that
becomes
the
wise
man
better
than
ich
dien
i
serve
and
they
also
serve
who
only
stand
and
wait
when
the
mortification
of
an
officer
because
of
his
being
appointed
to
a
command
inferior
to
what
he
considered
to
be
his
merits
was
communicated
to
the
duke
he
said
in
the
course
of
my
military
career
i
have
gone
from
the
command
of
a
brigade
to
that
of
my
regiment
and
from
the
command
of
an
army
to
that
of
a
brigade
or
a
division
as
i
was
ordered
and
without
any
feeling
of
mortification
whilst
commanding
the
allied
army
in
portugal
the
conduct
of
the
native
population
did
not
seem
to
wellington
to
be
either
becoming
or
dutiful
we
have
enthusiasm
in
plenty
he
said
and
plenty
of
cries
of
we
have
illuminations
patriotic
songs
and
fetes
everywhere
but
what
we
want
is
that
each
in
his
own
station
should
do
his
duty
faithfully
and
pay
implicit
obedience
to
legal
authority
this
abiding
ideal
of
duty
seemed
to
be
the
governing
principle
of
wellington
character
it
was
always
uppermost
in
his
mind
and
directed
all
the
public
actions
of
his
life
nor
did
it
fail
to
communicate
itself
to
those
under
him
who
served
him
in
the
like
spirit
when
he
rode
into
one
of
his
infantry
squares
at
waterloo
as
its
diminished
numbers
closed
up
to
receive
a
charge
of
french
cavalry
he
said
to
the
men
stand
steady
lads
think
of
what
they
will
say
of
us
in
england
to
which
the
men
replied
never
fear
sir
we
know
our
duty
duty
was
also
the
dominant
idea
in
nelson
mind
the
spirit
in
which
he
served
his
country
was
expressed
in
the
famous
watchword
england
expects
every
man
to
do
his
duty
signalled
by
him
to
the
fleet
before
going
into
action
at
trafalgar
as
well
as
in
the
last
words
that
passed
his
lips
i
have
done
my
duty
i
praise
god
for
it
and
nelson
companion
and
friend
the
brave
sensible
collingwood
he
who
as
his
ship
bore
down
into
the
great
said
to
his
just
about
this
time
our
wives
are
going
to
church
in
england
collingwood
too
was
like
his
commander
an
ardent
devotee
of
duty
do
your
duty
to
the
best
of
your
ability
was
the
maxim
which
he
urged
upon
many
young
men
starting
on
the
voyage
of
life
to
a
midshipman
he
once
gave
the
following
manly
and
sensible
advice
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
it
is
more
in
your
own
power
than
in
anybody
else
to
promote
both
your
comfort
and
advancement
a
strict
and
unwearied
attention
to
your
duty
and
a
complacent
and
respectful
behaviour
not
only
to
your
superiors
but
to
everybody
will
ensure
you
their
regard
and
the
reward
will
surely
come
but
if
it
should
not
i
am
convinced
you
have
too
much
good
sense
to
let
disappointment
sour
you
guard
carefully
against
letting
discontent
appear
in
you
it
will
be
sorrow
to
your
friends
a
triumph
to
your
competitors
and
can
not
be
productive
of
any
good
conduct
yourself
so
as
to
deserve
the
best
that
can
come
to
you
and
the
consciousness
of
your
own
proper
behaviour
will
keep
you
in
spirits
if
it
should
not
come
let
it
be
your
ambition
to
be
foremost
in
all
duty
do
not
be
a
nice
observer
of
turns
but
ever
present
yourself
ready
for
everything
and
unless
your
officers
are
very
inattentive
men
they
will
not
allow
others
to
impose
more
duty
on
you
than
they
should
this
devotion
to
duty
is
said
to
be
peculiar
to
the
english
nation
and
it
has
certainly
more
or
less
characterised
our
greatest
public
men
probably
no
commander
of
any
other
nation
ever
went
into
action
with
such
a
signal
flying
as
nelson
at
trafalgar
not
glory
or
victory
or
honour
or
country
but
simply
duty
how
few
are
the
nations
willing
to
rally
to
such
a
shortly
after
the
wreck
of
the
birkenhead
off
the
coast
of
africa
in
which
the
officers
and
men
went
down
firing
a
after
seeing
the
women
and
children
safely
embarked
in
the
boats
robertson
of
brighton
referring
to
the
circumstance
in
one
of
his
letters
said
yes
goodness
duty
sacrifice
these
are
the
qualities
that
england
honours
she
gapes
and
wonders
every
now
and
then
like
an
awkward
peasant
at
some
other
things
railway
kings
and
other
trumperies
but
nothing
stirs
her
grand
old
heart
down
to
its
central
deeps
universally
and
long
except
the
right
she
puts
on
her
shawl
very
badly
and
she
is
awkward
enough
in
a
scarce
knowing
a
swedish
nightingale
from
a
jackdaw
but
blessings
large
and
long
upon
her
she
knows
how
to
teach
her
sons
to
sink
like
men
amidst
sharks
and
billows
without
parade
without
display
as
if
duty
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
and
she
never
mistakes
long
an
actor
for
a
hero
or
a
hero
for
an
actor
it
is
a
grand
thing
after
all
this
pervading
spirit
of
duty
in
a
nation
and
so
long
as
it
survives
no
one
need
despair
of
its
future
but
when
it
has
departed
or
become
deadened
and
been
supplanted
by
thirst
for
pleasure
or
selfish
aggrandisement
or
glory
then
woe
to
that
nation
for
its
dissolution
is
near
at
hand
if
there
be
one
point
on
which
intelligent
observers
are
agreed
more
than
another
as
to
the
cause
of
the
late
deplorable
collapse
of
france
as
a
nation
it
was
the
utter
absence
of
this
feeling
of
duty
as
well
as
of
truthfulness
from
the
mind
not
only
of
the
men
but
of
the
leaders
of
the
french
people
the
unprejudiced
testimony
of
baron
stoffel
french
military
attache
at
berlin
before
the
war
is
conclusive
on
this
point
in
his
private
report
to
the
emperor
found
at
the
tuileries
which
was
written
in
august
about
a
year
before
the
outbreak
of
the
war
baron
stoffel
pointed
out
that
the
and
disciplined
german
people
were
pervaded
by
an
ardent
sense
of
duty
and
did
not
think
it
beneath
them
to
reverence
sincerely
what
was
noble
and
lofty
whereas
in
all
respects
france
presented
a
melancholy
contrast
there
the
people
having
sneered
at
everything
had
lost
the
faculty
of
respecting
anything
and
virtue
family
life
patriotism
honour
and
religion
were
represented
to
a
frivolous
generation
as
only
fitting
subjects
for
ridicule
alas
how
terribly
has
france
been
punished
for
her
sins
against
truth
and
duty
yet
the
time
was
when
france
possessed
many
great
men
inspired
by
duty
but
they
were
all
men
of
a
comparatively
remote
past
the
race
of
bayard
duguesclin
coligny
duquesne
turenne
colbert
and
sully
seems
to
have
died
out
and
left
no
lineage
there
has
been
an
occasional
great
frenchman
of
modern
times
who
has
raised
the
cry
of
duty
but
his
voice
has
been
as
that
of
one
crying
in
the
wilderness
de
tocqueville
was
one
of
such
but
like
all
men
of
his
stamp
he
was
proscribed
imprisoned
and
driven
from
public
life
writing
on
one
occasion
to
his
friend
kergorlay
he
said
like
you
i
become
more
and
more
alive
to
the
happiness
which
consists
in
the
fulfilment
of
duty
i
believe
there
is
no
other
so
deep
and
so
real
there
is
only
one
great
object
in
the
world
which
deserves
our
efforts
and
that
is
the
good
of
mankind
although
france
has
been
the
unquiet
spirit
among
the
nations
of
europe
since
the
reign
of
louis
there
have
from
time
to
time
been
honest
and
faithful
men
who
have
lifted
up
their
voices
against
the
turbulent
warlike
tendencies
of
the
people
and
not
only
preached
but
endeavoured
to
carry
into
practice
a
gospel
of
peace
of
these
the
abbe
de
was
one
of
the
most
courageous
he
had
even
the
boldness
to
denounce
the
wars
of
louis
and
to
deny
that
monarch
right
to
the
epithet
of
for
which
he
was
punished
by
expulsion
from
the
academy
the
abbe
was
as
enthusiastic
an
agitator
for
a
system
of
international
peace
as
any
member
of
the
modern
society
of
friends
as
joseph
sturge
went
to
petersburg
to
convert
the
emperor
of
russia
to
his
views
so
the
abbe
went
to
utrecht
to
convert
the
conference
sitting
there
to
his
project
for
a
diet
to
secure
perpetual
peace
of
course
he
was
regarded
as
an
enthusiast
cardinal
dubois
characterising
his
scheme
as
the
dream
of
an
honest
man
yet
the
abbe
had
found
his
dream
in
the
gospel
and
in
what
better
way
could
he
exemplify
the
spirit
of
the
master
he
served
than
by
endeavouring
to
abate
the
horrors
and
abominations
of
war
the
conference
was
an
assemblage
of
men
representing
christian
states
and
the
abbe
merely
called
upon
them
to
put
in
practice
the
doctrines
they
professed
to
believe
it
was
of
no
use
the
potentates
and
their
representatives
turned
to
him
a
deaf
ear
the
abbe
de
lived
several
hundred
years
too
soon
but
he
determined
that
his
idea
should
not
be
lost
and
in
he
published
his
of
perpetual
peace
he
there
proposed
the
formation
of
a
european
diet
or
senate
to
be
composed
of
representatives
of
all
nations
before
which
princes
should
be
bound
before
resorting
to
arms
to
state
their
grievances
and
require
redress
writing
about
eighty
years
after
the
publication
of
this
project
volney
asked
what
is
a
people
an
individual
of
the
society
at
large
what
a
war
a
duel
between
two
individual
people
in
what
manner
ought
a
society
to
act
when
two
of
its
members
fight
interfere
and
reconcile
or
repress
them
in
the
days
of
the
abbe
de
this
was
treated
as
a
dream
but
happily
for
the
human
race
it
begins
to
be
realised
alas
for
the
prediction
of
volney
the
years
that
followed
the
date
at
which
this
passage
was
written
were
distinguished
by
more
devastating
and
furious
wars
on
the
part
of
france
than
had
ever
been
known
in
the
world
before
the
abbe
was
not
however
a
mere
dreamer
he
was
an
active
practical
philanthropist
and
anticipated
many
social
improvements
which
have
since
become
generally
adopted
he
was
the
original
founder
of
industrial
schools
for
poor
children
where
they
not
only
received
a
good
education
but
learned
some
useful
trade
by
which
they
might
earn
an
honest
living
when
they
grew
up
to
manhood
he
advocated
the
revision
and
simplification
of
the
whole
code
of
laws
an
idea
afterwards
carried
out
by
the
first
napoleon
he
wrote
against
duelling
against
luxury
against
gambling
against
monasticism
quoting
the
remark
of
segrais
that
the
mania
for
a
monastic
life
is
the
smallpox
of
the
mind
he
spent
his
whole
income
in
acts
of
charity
not
in
almsgiving
but
in
helping
poor
children
and
poor
men
and
women
to
help
themselves
his
object
always
was
to
benefit
permanently
those
whom
he
assisted
he
continued
his
love
of
truth
and
his
freedom
of
speech
to
the
last
at
the
age
of
eighty
he
said
if
life
is
a
lottery
for
happiness
my
lot
has
been
one
of
the
best
when
on
his
deathbed
voltaire
asked
him
how
he
felt
to
which
he
answered
as
about
to
make
a
journey
into
the
country
and
in
this
peaceful
frame
of
mind
he
died
but
so
outspoken
had
been
against
corruption
in
high
places
that
maupertius
his
successor
at
the
academy
was
not
permitted
to
pronounce
his
eloge
nor
was
it
until
years
after
his
death
that
this
honour
was
done
to
his
memory
by
the
true
and
emphatic
epitaph
of
the
good
abbe
was
this
he
loved
much
duty
is
closely
allied
to
truthfulness
of
character
and
the
dutiful
man
is
above
all
things
truthful
in
his
words
as
in
his
actions
he
says
and
he
does
the
right
thing
in
the
right
way
and
at
the
right
time
there
is
probably
no
saying
of
lord
chesterfield
that
commends
itself
more
strongly
to
the
approval
of
men
than
that
it
is
truth
that
makes
the
success
of
the
gentleman
clarendon
speaking
of
one
of
the
noblest
and
purest
gentlemen
of
his
age
says
of
falkland
that
he
was
so
severe
an
adorer
of
truth
that
he
could
as
easily
have
given
himself
leave
to
steal
as
to
dissemble
it
was
one
of
the
finest
things
that
hutchinson
could
say
of
her
husband
that
he
was
a
thoroughly
truthful
and
reliable
man
he
never
professed
the
thing
he
intended
not
nor
promised
what
he
believed
out
of
his
power
nor
failed
in
the
performance
of
anything
that
was
in
his
power
to
fulfil
wellington
was
a
severe
admirer
of
truth
an
illustration
may
be
given
when
afflicted
by
deafness
he
consulted
a
celebrated
aurist
who
after
trying
all
remedies
in
vain
determined
as
a
last
resource
to
inject
into
the
ear
a
strong
solution
of
caustic
it
caused
the
most
intense
pain
but
the
patient
bore
it
with
his
usual
equanimity
the
family
physician
accidentally
calling
one
day
found
the
duke
with
flushed
cheeks
and
bloodshot
eyes
and
when
he
rose
he
staggered
about
like
a
drunken
man
the
doctor
asked
to
be
permitted
to
look
at
his
ear
and
then
he
found
that
a
furious
inflammation
was
going
on
which
if
not
immediately
checked
must
shortly
reach
the
brain
and
kill
him
vigorous
remedies
were
at
once
applied
and
the
inflammation
was
checked
but
the
hearing
of
that
ear
was
completely
destroyed
when
the
aurist
heard
of
the
danger
his
patient
had
run
through
the
violence
of
the
remedy
he
had
employed
he
hastened
to
apsley
house
to
express
his
grief
and
mortification
but
the
duke
merely
said
do
not
say
a
word
more
about
it
you
did
all
for
the
best
the
aurist
said
it
would
be
his
ruin
when
it
became
known
that
he
had
been
the
cause
of
so
much
suffering
and
danger
to
his
grace
but
nobody
need
know
anything
about
it
keep
your
own
counsel
and
depend
upon
it
i
wo
say
a
word
to
any
one
then
your
grace
will
allow
me
to
attend
you
as
usual
which
will
show
the
public
that
you
have
not
withdrawn
your
confidence
from
me
no
replied
the
duke
kindly
but
firmly
i
ca
do
that
for
that
would
be
a
lie
he
would
not
act
a
falsehood
any
more
than
he
would
speak
one
another
illustration
of
duty
and
truthfulness
as
exhibited
in
the
fulfilment
of
a
promise
may
be
added
from
the
life
of
blucher
when
he
was
hastening
with
his
army
over
bad
roads
to
the
help
of
wellington
on
the
of
june
he
encouraged
his
troops
by
words
and
gestures
forwards
children
forwards
it
is
impossible
it
ca
be
done
was
the
answer
again
and
again
he
urged
them
children
we
must
get
on
you
may
say
it
ca
be
done
but
it
must
be
done
i
have
promised
my
brother
wellington
promised
do
you
hear
you
would
have
me
break
my
word
and
it
was
done
truth
is
the
very
bond
of
society
without
which
it
must
cease
to
exist
and
dissolve
into
anarchy
and
chaos
a
household
can
not
be
governed
by
lying
nor
can
a
nation
sir
thomas
browne
once
asked
do
the
devils
lie
no
was
his
answer
for
then
even
hell
could
not
subsist
no
considerations
can
justify
the
sacrifice
of
truth
which
ought
to
be
sovereign
in
all
the
relations
of
life
of
all
mean
vices
perhaps
lying
is
the
meanest
it
is
in
some
cases
the
offspring
of
perversity
and
vice
and
in
many
others
of
sheer
moral
cowardice
yet
many
persons
think
so
lightly
of
it
that
they
will
order
their
servants
to
lie
for
them
nor
can
they
feel
surprised
if
after
such
ignoble
instruction
they
find
their
servants
lying
for
themselves
sir
harry
wotton
description
of
an
ambassador
as
an
honest
man
sent
to
lie
abroad
for
the
benefit
of
his
country
though
meant
as
a
satire
brought
him
into
disfavour
with
james
when
it
became
published
for
an
adversary
quoted
it
as
a
principle
of
the
king
religion
that
it
was
not
wotton
real
view
of
the
duty
of
an
honest
man
is
obvious
from
the
lines
quoted
at
the
head
of
this
chapter
on
character
of
a
happy
life
in
which
he
eulogises
the
man
whose
armour
is
his
honest
thought
and
simple
truth
his
utmost
skill
but
lying
assumes
many
forms
such
as
diplomacy
expediency
and
moral
reservation
and
under
one
guise
or
another
it
is
found
more
or
less
pervading
all
classes
of
society
sometimes
it
assumes
the
form
of
equivocation
or
moral
dodging
twisting
and
so
stating
the
things
said
as
to
convey
a
false
impression
a
kind
of
lying
which
a
frenchman
once
described
as
walking
round
about
the
truth
there
are
even
men
of
narrow
minds
and
dishonest
natures
who
pride
themselves
upon
their
jesuitical
cleverness
in
equivocation
in
their
shirking
of
the
truth
and
getting
out
of
moral
in
order
to
hide
their
real
opinions
and
evade
the
consequences
of
holding
and
openly
professing
them
institutions
or
systems
based
upon
any
such
expedients
must
necessarily
prove
false
and
hollow
though
a
lie
be
ever
so
well
dressed
says
george
herbert
it
is
ever
overcome
downright
lying
though
bolder
and
more
vicious
is
even
less
contemptible
than
such
kind
of
shuffling
and
equivocation
untruthfulness
exhibits
itself
in
many
other
forms
in
reticency
on
the
one
hand
or
exaggeration
on
the
other
in
disguise
or
concealment
in
pretended
concurrence
in
others
opinions
in
assuming
an
attitude
of
conformity
which
is
deceptive
in
making
promises
or
allowing
them
to
be
implied
which
are
never
intended
to
be
performed
or
even
in
refraining
from
speaking
the
truth
when
to
do
so
is
a
duty
there
are
also
those
who
are
all
things
to
all
men
who
say
one
thing
and
do
another
like
bunyan
only
deceiving
themselves
when
they
think
they
are
deceiving
others
and
who
being
essentially
insincere
fail
to
evoke
confidence
and
invariably
in
the
end
turn
out
failures
if
not
impostors
others
are
untruthful
in
their
pretentiousness
and
in
assuming
merits
which
they
do
not
really
possess
the
truthful
man
is
on
the
contrary
modest
and
makes
no
parade
of
himself
and
his
deeds
when
pitt
was
in
his
last
illness
the
news
reached
england
of
the
great
deeds
of
wellington
in
india
the
more
i
hear
of
his
exploits
said
pitt
the
more
i
admire
the
modesty
with
which
he
receives
the
praises
he
merits
for
them
he
is
the
only
man
i
ever
knew
that
was
not
vain
of
what
he
had
done
and
yet
had
so
much
reason
to
be
so
so
it
is
said
of
faraday
by
professor
tyndall
that
pretence
of
all
kinds
whether
in
life
or
in
philosophy
was
hateful
to
him
marshall
hall
was
a
man
of
like
spirit
courageously
truthful
dutiful
and
manly
one
of
his
most
intimate
friends
has
said
of
him
that
wherever
he
met
with
untruthfulness
or
sinister
motive
he
would
expose
it
saying
i
neither
will
nor
can
give
my
consent
to
a
lie
the
question
right
or
wrong
once
decided
in
his
own
mind
the
right
was
followed
no
matter
what
the
sacrifice
or
the
difficulty
neither
expediency
nor
inclination
weighing
one
jot
in
the
balance
there
was
no
virtue
that
arnold
laboured
more
sedulously
to
instil
into
young
men
than
the
virtue
of
truthfulness
as
being
the
manliest
of
virtues
as
indeed
the
very
basis
of
all
true
manliness
he
designated
truthfulness
as
moral
transparency
and
he
valued
it
more
highly
than
any
other
quality
when
lying
was
detected
he
treated
it
as
a
great
moral
offence
but
when
a
pupil
made
an
assertion
he
accepted
it
with
confidence
if
you
say
so
that
is
quite
enough
of
course
i
believe
your
word
by
thus
trusting
and
believing
them
he
educated
the
young
in
truthfulness
the
boys
at
length
coming
to
say
to
one
another
a
shame
to
tell
arnold
a
lie
he
always
believes
one
one
of
the
most
striking
instances
that
could
be
given
of
the
character
of
the
dutiful
truthful
laborious
man
is
presented
in
the
life
of
the
late
george
wilson
professor
of
technology
in
the
university
of
edinburgh
though
we
bring
this
illustration
under
the
head
of
duty
it
might
equally
have
stood
under
that
of
courage
cheerfulness
or
industry
for
it
is
alike
illustrative
of
these
several
qualities
wilson
life
was
indeed
a
marvel
of
cheerful
laboriousness
exhibiting
the
power
of
the
soul
to
triumph
over
the
body
and
almost
to
set
it
at
defiance
it
might
be
taken
as
an
illustration
of
the
saying
of
the
to
kane
as
to
the
power
of
moral
force
over
physical
bless
you
sir
the
soul
will
any
day
lift
the
body
out
of
its
boots
a
fragile
but
bright
and
lively
boy
he
had
scarcely
entered
manhood
ere
his
constitution
began
to
exhibit
signs
of
disease
as
early
indeed
as
his
seventeenth
year
he
began
to
complain
of
melancholy
and
sleeplessness
supposed
to
be
the
effects
of
bile
i
do
think
i
shall
live
long
he
then
said
to
a
friend
my
mind
will
must
work
itself
out
and
the
body
will
soon
follow
it
a
strange
confession
for
a
boy
to
make
but
he
gave
his
physical
health
no
fair
chance
his
life
was
all
study
and
competition
when
he
took
exercise
it
was
in
sudden
bursts
which
did
him
more
harm
than
good
long
walks
in
the
highlands
jaded
and
exhausted
him
and
he
returned
to
his
unrested
and
unrefreshed
it
was
during
one
of
his
forced
walks
of
some
miles
in
the
neighbourhood
of
stirling
that
he
injured
one
of
his
feet
and
he
returned
home
seriously
ill
the
result
was
an
abscess
disease
of
the
and
long
agony
which
ended
in
the
amputation
of
the
right
foot
but
he
never
relaxed
in
his
labours
he
was
now
writing
lecturing
and
teaching
chemistry
rheumatism
and
acute
inflammation
of
the
eye
next
attacked
him
and
were
treated
by
cupping
blisetring
and
colchicum
unable
himself
to
write
he
went
on
preparing
his
lectures
which
he
dictated
to
his
sister
pain
haunted
him
day
and
night
and
sleep
was
only
forced
by
morphia
while
in
this
state
of
general
prostration
symptoms
of
pulmonary
disease
began
to
show
themselves
yet
he
continued
to
give
the
weekly
lectures
to
which
he
stood
committed
to
the
edinburgh
school
of
arts
not
one
was
shirked
though
their
delivery
before
a
large
audience
was
a
most
exhausting
duty
well
there
another
nail
put
into
my
coffin
was
the
remark
made
on
throwing
off
his
on
returning
home
and
a
sleepless
night
almost
invariably
followed
at
wilson
was
lecturing
ten
eleven
or
more
hours
weekly
usually
with
setons
or
open
upon
him
his
bosom
friends
he
used
to
call
them
he
felt
the
shadow
of
death
upon
him
and
he
worked
as
if
his
days
were
numbered
do
be
surprised
he
wrote
to
a
friend
if
any
morning
at
breakfast
you
hear
that
i
am
gone
but
while
he
said
so
he
did
not
in
the
least
degree
indulge
in
the
feeling
of
sickly
sentimentality
he
worked
on
as
cheerfully
and
hopefully
as
if
in
the
very
fulness
of
his
strength
to
none
said
he
is
life
so
sweet
as
to
those
who
have
lost
all
fear
to
die
sometimes
he
was
compelled
to
desist
from
his
labours
by
sheer
debility
occasioned
by
loss
of
blood
from
the
lungs
but
after
a
few
weeks
rest
and
change
of
air
he
would
return
to
his
work
saying
the
water
is
rising
in
the
well
again
though
disease
had
fastened
on
his
lungs
and
was
spreading
there
and
though
suffering
from
a
distressing
cough
he
went
on
lecturing
as
usual
to
add
to
his
troubles
when
one
day
endeavouring
to
recover
himself
from
a
stumble
occasioned
by
his
lameness
he
overstrained
his
arm
and
broke
the
bone
near
the
shoulder
but
he
recovered
from
his
successive
accidents
and
illnesses
in
the
most
extraordinary
way
the
reed
bent
but
did
not
break
the
storm
passed
and
it
stood
erect
as
before
there
was
no
worry
nor
fever
nor
fret
about
him
but
instead
cheerfulness
patience
and
unfailing
perseverance
his
mind
amidst
all
his
sufferings
remained
perfectly
calm
and
serene
he
went
about
his
daily
work
with
an
apparently
charmed
life
as
if
he
had
the
strength
of
many
men
in
him
yet
all
the
while
he
knew
he
was
dying
his
chief
anxiety
being
to
conceal
his
state
from
those
about
him
at
home
to
whom
the
knowledge
of
his
actual
condition
would
have
been
inexpressibly
distressing
i
am
cheerful
among
strangers
he
said
and
try
to
live
day
by
day
as
a
dying
man
he
went
on
teaching
as
before
lecturing
to
the
architectural
institute
and
to
the
school
of
arts
one
day
after
a
lecture
before
the
latter
institute
he
lay
down
to
rest
and
was
shortly
awakened
by
the
rupture
of
a
bloodvessel
which
occasioned
him
the
loss
of
a
considerable
quantity
of
blood
he
did
not
experience
the
despair
and
agony
that
keats
did
on
a
like
occasion
though
he
equally
knew
that
the
messenger
of
death
had
come
and
was
waiting
for
him
he
appeared
at
the
family
meals
as
usual
and
next
day
he
lectured
twice
punctually
fulfilling
his
engagements
but
the
exertion
of
speaking
was
followed
by
a
second
attack
of
haemorrhage
he
now
became
seriously
ill
and
it
was
doubted
whether
he
would
survive
the
night
but
he
did
survive
and
during
his
convalescence
he
was
appointed
to
an
important
public
office
that
of
director
of
the
scottish
industrial
museum
which
involved
a
great
amount
of
labour
as
well
as
lecturing
in
his
capacity
of
professor
of
technology
which
he
held
in
connection
with
the
office
from
this
time
forward
his
dear
museum
as
he
called
it
absorbed
all
his
surplus
energies
while
busily
occupied
in
collecting
models
and
specimens
for
the
museum
he
filled
up
his
of
time
in
lecturing
to
ragged
schools
ragged
kirks
and
medical
missionary
societies
he
gave
himself
no
rest
either
of
mind
or
body
and
to
die
working
was
the
fate
he
envied
his
mind
would
not
give
in
but
his
poor
body
was
forced
to
yield
and
a
severe
attack
of
haemorrhage
bleeding
from
both
lungs
and
stomach
compelled
him
to
relax
in
his
labours
for
a
month
or
some
forty
days
he
wrote
a
dreadful
lent
the
mind
has
blown
geographically
from
the
blest
but
thermometrically
from
iceland
the
accursed
i
have
been
made
a
prisoner
of
war
hit
by
an
icicle
in
the
lungs
and
have
shivered
and
burned
alternately
for
a
large
portion
of
the
last
month
and
spat
blood
till
i
grew
pale
with
coughing
now
i
am
better
and
i
give
my
concluding
lecture
technology
thankful
that
i
have
contrived
notwithstanding
all
my
troubles
to
carry
on
without
missing
a
lecture
to
the
last
day
of
the
faculty
of
arts
to
which
i
belong
how
long
was
it
to
last
he
himself
began
to
wonder
for
he
had
long
felt
his
life
as
if
ebbing
away
at
length
he
became
languid
weary
and
unfit
for
work
even
the
writing
of
a
letter
cost
him
a
painful
effort
and
he
felt
as
if
to
lie
down
and
sleep
were
the
only
things
worth
doing
yet
shortly
after
to
help
a
he
wrote
his
gateways
of
knowledge
as
a
lecture
and
afterwards
expanded
it
into
a
book
he
also
recovered
strength
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
proceed
with
his
lectures
to
the
institutions
to
which
he
belonged
besides
on
various
occasions
undertaking
to
do
other
people
work
i
am
looked
upon
as
good
as
mad
he
wrote
to
his
brother
because
on
a
hasty
notice
i
took
a
defaulting
lecturer
place
at
the
philosophical
institution
and
discoursed
on
the
polarization
of
light
but
i
like
work
it
is
a
family
weakness
then
followed
chronic
malaise
sleepless
nights
days
of
pain
and
more
spitting
of
blood
my
only
painless
moments
he
says
were
when
lecturing
in
this
state
of
prostration
and
disease
the
indefatigable
man
undertook
to
write
the
of
edward
forbes
and
he
did
it
like
everything
he
undertook
with
admirable
ability
he
proceeded
with
his
lectures
as
usual
to
an
association
of
teachers
he
delivered
a
discourse
on
the
educational
value
of
industrial
science
after
he
had
spoken
to
his
audience
for
an
hour
he
left
them
to
say
whether
he
should
go
on
or
not
and
they
cheered
him
on
to
another
address
it
is
curious
he
wrote
the
feeling
of
having
an
audience
like
clay
in
your
hands
to
mould
for
a
season
as
you
please
it
is
a
terribly
responsible
power
i
do
not
mean
for
a
moment
to
imply
that
i
am
indifferent
to
the
good
opinion
of
others
far
otherwise
but
to
gain
this
is
much
less
a
concern
with
me
than
to
deserve
it
it
was
not
so
once
i
had
no
wish
for
unmerited
praise
but
i
was
too
ready
to
settle
that
i
did
merit
it
now
the
word
duty
seems
to
me
the
biggest
word
in
the
world
and
is
uppermost
in
all
my
serious
doings
this
was
written
only
about
four
months
before
his
death
a
little
later
he
wrote
i
spin
my
thread
of
life
from
week
to
week
rather
than
from
year
to
year
constant
attacks
of
bleeding
from
the
lungs
sapped
his
little
remaining
strength
but
did
not
altogether
disable
him
from
lecturing
he
was
amused
by
one
of
his
friends
proposing
to
put
him
under
trustees
for
the
purpose
of
looking
after
his
health
but
he
would
not
be
restrained
from
working
so
long
as
a
vestige
of
strength
remained
one
day
in
the
autumn
of
he
returned
from
his
customary
lecture
in
the
university
of
edinburgh
with
a
severe
pain
in
his
side
he
was
scarcely
able
to
crawl
upstairs
medical
aid
was
sent
for
and
he
was
pronounced
to
be
suffering
from
pleurisy
and
inflammation
of
the
lungs
his
enfeebled
frame
was
ill
able
to
resist
so
severe
a
disease
and
he
sank
peacefully
to
the
rest
he
so
longed
for
after
a
few
days
illness
wrong
not
the
dead
with
tears
a
glorious
bright
endeth
a
weary
life
of
pain
and
sorrow
the
life
of
george
wilson
so
admirably
and
affectionately
related
by
his
sister
is
probably
one
of
the
most
marvellous
records
of
pain
and
longsuffering
and
yet
of
persistent
noble
and
useful
work
that
is
to
be
found
in
the
whole
history
of
literature
his
entire
career
was
indeed
but
a
prolonged
illustration
of
the
lines
which
he
himself
addressed
to
his
deceased
friend
john
reid
a
likeminded
man
whose
memoir
he
wrote
thou
wert
a
daily
lesson
of
courage
hope
and
faith
we
wondered
at
thee
living
we
envy
thee
thy
death
thou
wert
so
meek
and
reverent
so
resolute
of
will
so
bold
to
bear
the
uttermost
and

so
calm

temper
is
of

bishop

heaven
is
a

should
my

as
youth
is
apt
i
know
some
harshness
show
all
vain
asperities
i
day
by

would
wear
away
till
the

of

age
should
be

leaves
upon
the
holly

southey
even
power
itself
hath
not
the

of

leigh
hunt
it
has
been
said
that
men
succeed
in
life
quite
as
much
by
their
temper
as
by
their
talents
however
this
may
be
it
is
certain
that
their
happiness
in
life
depends
mainly
upon
their
equanimity
of
disposition
their
patience
and
forbearance
and
their
kindness
and
thoughtfulness
for
those
about
them
it
is
really
true
what
plato
says
that
in
seeking
the
good
of
others
we
find
our
own
there
are
some
natures
so
happily
constituted
that
they
can
find
good
in
everything
there
is
no
calamity
so
great
but
they
can
educe
comfort
or
consolation
from
it
no
sky
so
black
but
they
can
discover
a
gleam
of
sunshine
issuing
through
it
from
some
quarter
or
another
and
if
the
sun
be
not
visible
to
their
eyes
they
at
least
comfort
themselves
with
the
thought
that
it
is
there
though
veiled
from
them
for
some
good
and
wise
purpose
such
happy
natures
are
to
be
envied
they
have
a
beam
in
the
eye
a
beam
of
pleasure
gladness
religious
cheerfulness
philosophy
call
it
what
you
will
sunshine
is
about
their
hearts
and
their
mind
gilds
with
its
own
hues
all
that
it
looks
upon
when
they
have
burdens
to
bear
they
bear
them
cheerfully
not
repining
nor
fretting
nor
wasting
their
energies
in
useless
lamentation
but
struggling
onward
manfully
gathering
up
such
flowers
as
lie
along
their
path
let
it
not
for
a
moment
be
supposed
that
men
such
as
those
we
speak
of
are
weak
and
unreflective
the
largest
and
most
comprehensive
natures
are
generally
also
the
most
cheerful
the
most
loving
the
most
hopeful
the
most
trustful
it
is
the
wise
man
of
large
vision
who
is
the
quickest
to
discern
the
moral
sunshine
gleaming
through
the
darkest
cloud
in
present
evil
he
sees
prospective
good
in
pain
he
recognises
the
effort
of
nature
to
restore
health
in
trials
he
finds
correction
and
discipline
and
in
sorrow
and
suffering
he
gathers
courage
knowledge
and
the
best
practical
wisdom
when
jeremy
taylor
had
lost
all
when
his
house
had
been
plundered
and
his
family
driven
and
all
his
worldly
estate
had
been
sequestrated
he
could
still
write
thus
i
am
fallen
into
the
hands
of
publicans
and
sequestrators
and
they
have
taken
all
from
me
what
now
let
me
look
about
me
they
have
left
me
the
sun
and
moon
a
loving
wife
and
many
friends
to
pity
me
and
some
to
relieve
me
and
i
can
still
discourse
and
unless
i
list
they
have
not
taken
away
my
merry
countenance
and
my
cheerful
spirit
and
a
good
conscience
they
have
still
left
me
the
providence
of
god
and
all
the
promises
of
the
gospel
and
my
religion
and
my
hopes
of
heaven
and
my
charity
to
them
too
and
still
i
sleep
and
digest
i
eat
and
drink
i
read
and
meditate
and
he
that
hath
so
many
causes
of
joy
and
so
great
is
very
much
in
love
with
sorrow
and
peevishness
who
loves
all
these
pleasures
and
chooses
to
sit
down
upon
his
little
handful
of
thorns
although
cheerfulness
of
disposition
is
very
much
a
matter
of
inborn
temperament
it
is
also
capable
of
being
trained
and
cultivated
like
any
other
habit
we
may
make
the
best
of
life
or
we
may
make
the
worst
of
it
and
it
depends
very
much
upon
ourselves
whether
we
extract
joy
or
misery
from
it
there
are
always
two
sides
of
life
on
which
we
can
look
according
as
we
choose
the
bright
side
or
the
gloomy
we
can
bring
the
power
of
the
will
to
bear
in
making
the
choice
and
thus
cultivate
the
habit
of
being
happy
or
the
reverse
we
can
encourage
the
disposition
of
looking
at
the
brightest
side
of
things
instead
of
the
darkest
and
while
we
see
the
cloud
let
us
not
shut
our
eyes
to
the
silver
lining
the
beam
in
the
eye
sheds
brightness
beauty
and
joy
upon
life
in
all
its
phases
it
shines
upon
coldness
and
warms
it
upon
suffering
and
comforts
it
upon
ignorance
and
enlightens
it
upon
sorrow
and
cheers
it
the
beam
in
the
eye
gives
lustre
to
intellect
and
brightens
beauty
itself
without
it
the
sunshine
of
life
is
not
felt
flowers
bloom
in
vain
the
marvels
of
heaven
and
earth
are
not
seen
or
acknowledged
and
creation
is
but
a
dreary
lifeless
soulless
blank
while
cheerfulness
of
disposition
is
a
great
source
of
enjoyment
in
life
it
is
also
a
great
safeguard
of
character
a
devotional
writer
of
the
present
day
in
answer
to
the
question
how
are
we
to
overcome
temptations
says
cheerfulness
is
the
first
thing
cheerfulness
is
the
second
and
cheerfulness
is
the
third
it
furnishes
the
best
soil
for
the
growth
of
goodness
and
virtue
it
gives
brightness
of
heart
and
elasticity
of
spirit
it
is
the
companion
of
charity
the
nurse
of
patience
the
mother
of
wisdom
it
is
also
the
best
of
moral
and
mental
tonics
the
best
cordial
of
all
said
marshall
hall
to
one
of
his
patients
is
cheerfulness
and
solomon
has
said
that
a
merry
heart
doeth
good
like
a
medicine
when
luther
was
once
applied
to
for
a
remedy
against
melancholy
his
advice
was
gaiety
and
courage
innocent
gaiety
and
rational
honourable
courage
are
the
best
medicine
for
young
men
and
for
old
men
too
for
all
men
against
sad
thoughts
next
to
music
if
not
before
it
luther
loved
children
and
flowers
the
great
gnarled
man
had
a
heart
as
tender
as
a
woman
cheerfulness
is
also
an
excellent
wearing
quality
it
has
been
called
the
bright
weather
of
the
heart
it
gives
harmony
of
soul
and
is
a
perpetual
song
without
words
it
is
tantamount
to
repose
it
enables
nature
to
recruit
its
strength
whereas
worry
and
discontent
debilitate
it
involving
constant
how
is
it
that
we
see
such
men
as
lord
palmerston
growing
old
in
harness
working
on
vigorously
to
the
end
mainly
through
equanimity
of
temper
and
habitual
cheerfulness
they
have
educated
themselves
in
the
habit
of
endurance
of
not
being
easily
provoked
of
bearing
and
forbearing
of
hearing
harsh
and
even
unjust
things
said
of
them
without
indulging
in
undue
resentment
and
avoiding
worreting
petty
and
cares
an
intimate
friend
of
lord
palmerston
who
observed
him
closely
for
twenty
years
has
said
that
he
never
saw
him
angry
with
perhaps
one
exception
and
that
was
when
the
ministry
responsible
for
the
calamity
in
affghanistan
of
which
he
was
one
were
unjustly
accused
by
their
opponents
of
falsehood
perjury
and
wilful
mutilation
of
public
documents
so
far
as
can
be
learnt
from
biography
men
of
the
greatest
genius
have
been
for
the
most
part
cheerful
contented
men
not
eager
for
reputation
money
or
power
but
relishing
life
and
keenly
susceptible
of
enjoyment
as
we
find
reflected
in
their
works
such
seem
to
have
been
homer
horace
virgil
montaigne
shakspeare
cervantes
healthy
serene
cheerfulness
is
apparent
in
their
great
creations
among
the
same
class
of
men
may
also
be
mentioned
luther
more
bacon
leonardo
da
vinci
raphael
and
michael
angelo
perhaps
they
were
happy
because
constantly
occupied
and
in
the
pleasantest
of
all
work
that
of
creating
out
of
the
fulness
and
richness
of
their
great
minds
milton
too
though
a
man
of
many
trials
and
sufferings
must
have
been
a
man
of
great
cheerfulness
and
elasticity
of
nature
though
overtaken
by
blindness
deserted
by
friends
and
fallen
upon
evil
days
darkness
before
and
danger

behind
yet
did
he
not
bate

or
hope
but
still
bore
up
and
steered
right
onward
henry
fielding
was
a
man
borne
down
through
life
by
debt
and
difficulty
and
bodily
suffering
and
yet
lady
mary
wortley
montague
has
said
of
him
that
by
virtue
of
his
cheerful
disposition
she
was
persuaded
he
had
known
more
happy
moments
than
any
person
on
earth
johnson
through
all
his
trials
and
sufferings
and
hard
fights
with
fortune
was
a
courageous
and
man
he
manfully
made
the
best
of
life
and
tried
to
be
glad
in
it
once
when
a
clergyman
was
complaining
of
the
dulness
of
society
in
the
country
saying
they
only
talk
of
runts
cows
johnson
felt
flattered
by
the
observation
of
thrale
mother
who
said
sir
johnson
would
learn
to
talk
of
runts
meaning
that
he
was
a
man
who
would
make
the
most
of
his
situation
whatever
it
was
johnson
was
of
opinion
that
a
man
grew
better
as
he
grew
older
and
that
his
nature
mellowed
with
age
this
is
certainly
a
much
more
cheerful
view
of
human
nature
than
that
of
lord
chesterfield
who
saw
life
through
the
eyes
of
a
cynic
and
held
that
the
heart
never
grows
better
by
age
it
only
grows
harder
but
both
sayings
may
be
true
according
to
the
point
from
which
life
is
viewed
and
the
temper
by
which
a
man
is
governed
for
while
the
good
profiting
by
experience
and
disciplining
themselves
by
will
grow
better
the
uninfluenced
by
experience
will
only
grow
worse
sir
walter
scott
was
a
man
full
of
the
milk
of
human
kindness
everybody
loved
him
he
was
never
five
minutes
in
a
room
ere
the
little
pets
of
the
family
whether
dumb
or
lisping
had
found
out
his
kindness
for
all
their
generation
scott
related
to
captain
basil
hall
an
incident
of
his
boyhood
which
showed
the
tenderness
of
his
nature
one
day
a
dog
coming
towards
him
he
took
up
a
big
stone
threw
it
and
hit
the
dog
the
poor
creature
had
strength
enough
left
to
crawl
up
to
him
and
lick
his
feet
although
he
saw
its
leg
was
broken
the
incident
he
said
had
given
him
the
bitterest
remorse
in
his
but
he
added
an
early
circumstance
of
that
kind
properly
reflected
on
is
calculated
to
have
the
best
effect
on
one
character
throughout
life
give
me
an
honest
laugher
scott
would
say
and
he
himself
laughed
the
heart
laugh
he
had
a
kind
word
for
everybody
and
his
kindness
acted
all
round
him
like
a
contagion
dispelling
the
reserve
and
awe
which
his
great
name
was
calculated
to
inspire
he
come
here
said
the
keeper
of
the
ruins
of
melrose
abbey
to
washington
irving
he
come
here
wi
great
folks
in
his
company
and
the
first
i
know
of
it
is
hearing
his
voice
calling
out
johnny
bower
and
when
i
go
out
i
sure
to
be
greeted
wi
a
joke
or
a
pleasant
word
he
stand
and
crack
and
laugh
wi
me
just
like
an
auld
wife
and
to
think
that
of
a
man
that
has
such
an
awfu
knowledge
o
history
arnold
was
a
man
of
the
same
hearty
cordiality
of
manner
full
of
human
sympathy
there
was
not
a
particle
of
affectation
or
pretence
of
condescension
about
him
i
never
knew
such
a
humble
man
as
the
doctor
said
the
parish
clerk
at
laleham
he
comes
and
shakes
us
by
the
hand
as
if
he
was
one
of
us
he
used
to
come
into
my
house
said
an
old
woman
near
fox
how
and
talk
to
me
as
if
i
were
a
lady
sydney
smith
was
another
illustration
of
the
power
of
cheerfulness
he
was
ever
ready
to
look
on
the
bright
side
of
things
the
darkest
cloud
had
to
him
its
silver
lining
whether
working
as
country
curate
or
as
parish
rector
he
was
always
kind
laborious
patient
and
exemplary
exhibiting
in
every
sphere
of
life
the
spirit
of
a
christian
the
kindness
of
a
pastor
and
the
honour
of
a
gentleman
in
his
leisure
he
employed
his
pen
on
the
side
of
justice
freedom
education
toleration
emancipation
and
his
writings
though
full
of
and
bright
humour
are
never
vulgar
nor
did
he
ever
pander
to
popularity
or
prejudice
his
good
spirits
thanks
to
his
natural
vivacity
and
stamina
of
constitution
never
forsook
him
and
in
his
old
age
when
borne
down
by
disease
he
wrote
to
a
friend
i
have
gout
asthma
and
seven
other
maladies
but
am
otherwise
very
well
in
one
of
the
last
letters
he
wrote
to
lady
carlisle
he
said
if
you
hear
of
sixteen
or
eighteen
pounds
of
flesh
wanting
an
owner
they
belong
to
me
i
look
as
if
a
curate
had
been
taken
out
of
me
great
men
of
science
have
for
the
most
part
been
patient
laborious
men
such
were
galileo
descartes
newton
and
laplace
euler
the
mathematician
one
of
the
greatest
of
natural
philosophers
was
a
distinguished
instance
towards
the
close
of
his
life
he
became
completely
blind
but
he
went
on
writing
as
cheerfully
as
before
supplying
the
want
of
sight
by
various
ingenious
mechanical
devices
and
by
the
increased
cultivation
of
his
memory
which
became
exceedingly
tenacious
his
chief
pleasure
was
in
the
society
of
his
grandchildren
to
whom
he
taught
their
little
lessons
in
the
intervals
of
his
severer
studies
in
like
manner
professor
robison
of
edinburgh
the
first
editor
of
the
britannica
when
disabled
from
work
by
a
lingering
and
painful
disorder
found
his
chief
pleasure
in
the
society
of
his
grandchild
i
am
infinitely
delighted
he
wrote
to
james
watt
with
observing
the
growth
of
its
little
soul
and
particularly
with
its
numberless
instincts
which
formerly
passed
unheeded
i
thank
the
french
theorists
for
more
forcibly
directing
my
attention
to
the
finger
of
god
which
i
discern
in
every
awkward
movement
and
every
wayward
whim
they
are
all
guardians
of
his
life
and
growth
and
power
i
regret
indeed
that
i
have
not
time
to
make
infancy
and
the
development
of
its
powers
my
sole
study
one
of
the
sorest
trials
of
a
man
temper
and
patience
was
that
which
befell
abauzit
the
natural
philosopher
while
residing
at
geneva
resembling
in
many
respects
a
similar
calamity
which
occurred
to
newton
and
which
he
bore
with
equal
resignation
amongst
other
things
abauzit
devoted
much
study
to
the
barometer
and
its
variations
with
the
object
of
deducing
the
general
laws
which
regulated
atmospheric
pressure
during
years
he
made
numerous
observations
daily
recording
them
on
sheets
prepared
for
the
purpose
one
day
when
a
new
servant
was
installed
in
the
house
she
immediately
proceeded
to
display
her
zeal
by
putting
things
abauzit
study
amongst
other
rooms
was
made
tidy
and
set
in
order
when
he
entered
it
he
asked
of
the
servant
what
have
you
done
with
the
paper
that
was
round
the
barometer
oh
sir
was
the
reply
it
was
so
dirty
that
i
burnt
it
and
put
in
its
place
this
paper
which
you
will
see
is
quite
new
abauzit
crossed
his
arms
and
after
some
moments
of
internal
struggle
he
said
in
a
tone
of
calmness
and
resignation
you
have
destroyed
the
results
of
years
labour
in
future
touch
nothing
whatever
in
this
room
the
study
of
natural
history
more
than
that
of
any
other
branch
of
science
seems
to
be
accompanied
by
unusual
cheerfulness
and
equanimity
of
temper
on
the
part
of
its
votaries
the
result
of
which
is
that
the
life
of
naturalists
is
on
the
whole
more
prolonged
than
that
of
any
other
class
of
men
of
science
a
member
of
the
linnaean
society
has
informed
us
that
of
fourteen
members
who
died
in
two
were
over
ninety
five
were
over
eighty
and
two
were
over
seventy
the
average
age
of
all
the
members
who
died
in
that
year
was
adanson
the
french
botanist
was
about
seventy
years
old
when
the
revolution
broke
out
and
amidst
the
shock
he
lost
everything
his
fortune
his
places
and
his
gardens
but
his
patience
courage
and
resignation
never
forsook
him
he
became
reduced
to
the
greatest
straits
and
even
wanted
food
and
clothing
yet
his
ardour
of
investigation
remained
the
same
once
when
the
institute
invited
him
as
being
one
of
its
oldest
members
to
assist
at
a
seance
his
answer
was
that
he
regretted
he
could
not
attend
for
want
of
shoes
it
was
a
touching
sight
says
cuvier
to
see
the
poor
old
man
bent
over
the
embers
of
a
decaying
fire
trying
to
trace
characters
with
a
feeble
hand
on
the
little
bit
of
paper
which
he
held
forgetting
all
the
pains
of
life
in
some
new
idea
in
natural
history
which
came
to
him
like
some
beneficent
fairy
to
cheer
him
in
his
loneliness
the
directory
eventually
gave
him
a
small
pension
which
napoleon
doubled
and
at
length
easeful
death
came
to
his
relief
in
his
year
a
clause
in
his
will
as
to
the
manner
of
his
funeral
illustrates
the
character
of
the
man
he
directed
that
a
garland
of
flowers
provided
by
families
whom
he
had
established
in
life
should
be
the
only
decoration
of
his
coffin
a
slight
but
touching
image
of
the
more
durable
monument
which
he
had
erected
for
himself
in
his
works
such
are
only
a
few
instances
of
the
of
great
men
which
might
indeed
be
multiplied
to
any
extent
all
large
healthy
natures
are
cheerful
as
well
as
hopeful
their
example
is
also
contagious
and
diffusive
brightening
and
cheering
all
who
come
within
reach
of
their
influence
it
was
said
of
sir
john
malcolm
when
he
appeared
in
a
saddened
camp
in
india
that
it
was
like
a
gleam
of
sunlight
no
man
left
him
without
a
smile
on
his
face
he
was
malcolm
still
it
was
impossible
to
resist
the
fascination
of
his
genial
presence
there
was
the
same
joyousness
of
nature
about
edmund
burke
once
at
a
dinner
at
sir
joshua
reynolds
when
the
conversation
turned
upon
the
suitability
of
liquors
for
particular
temperaments
johnson
said
claret
is
for
boys
port
for
men
and
brandy
for
heroes
then
said
burke
let
me
have
claret
i
love
to
be
a
boy
and
to
have
the
careless
gaiety
of
boyish
days
and
so
it
is
that
there
are
old
young
men
and
young
old
men
some
who
are
as
joyous
and
cheerful
as
boys
in
their
old
age
and
others
who
are
as
morose
and
cheerless
as
saddened
old
men
while
still
in
their
boyhood
in
the
presence
of
some
priggish
youths
we
have
heard
a
cheerful
old
man
declare
that
apparently
there
would
soon
be
nothing
but
old
boys
left
cheerfulness
being
generous
and
genial
joyous
and
hearty
is
never
the
characteristic
of
prigs
goethe
used
to
exclaim
of
persons
oh
if
they
had
but
the
heart
to
commit
an
absurdity
this
was
when
he
thought
they
wanted
heartiness
and
nature
pretty
dolls
was
his
expression
when
speaking
of
them
and
turning
away
the
true
basis
of
cheerfulness
is
love
hope
and
patience
love
evokes
love
and
begets
loving
kindness
love
cherishes
hopeful
and
generous
thoughts
of
others
it
is
charitable
gentle
and
truthful
it
is
a
discerner
of
good
it
turns
to
the
brightest
side
of
things
and
its
face
is
ever
directed
towards
happiness
it
sees
the
glory
in
the
grass
the
sunshine
on
the
flower
it
encourages
happy
thoughts
and
lives
in
an
atmosphere
of
cheerfulness
it
costs
nothing
and
yet
is
invaluable
for
it
blesses
its
possessor
and
grows
up
in
abundant
happiness
in
the
bosoms
of
others
even
its
sorrows
are
linked
with
pleasures
and
its
very
tears
are
sweet
bentham
lays
it
down
as
a
principle
that
a
man
becomes
rich
in
his
own
stock
of
pleasures
in
proportion
to
the
amount
he
distributes
to
others
his
kindness
will
evoke
kindness
and
his
happiness
be
increased
by
his
own
benevolence
kind
words
he
says
cost
no
more
than
unkind
ones
kind
words
produce
kind
actions
not
only
on
the
part
of
him
to
whom
they
are
addressed
but
on
the
part
of
him
by
whom
they
are
employed
and
this
not
incidentally
only
but
habitually
in
virtue
of
the
principle
of
it
may
indeed
happen
that
the
effort
of
beneficence
may
not
benefit
those
for
whom
it
was
intended
but
when
wisely
directed
it
must
benefit
the
person
from
whom
it
emanates
good
and
friendly
conduct
may
meet
with
an
unworthy
and
ungrateful
return
but
the
absence
of
gratitude
on
the
part
of
the
receiver
can
not
destroy
the
which
recompenses
the
giver
and
we
may
scatter
the
seeds
of
courtesy
and
kindliness
around
us
at
so
little
expense
some
of
them
will
inevitably
fall
on
good
ground
and
grow
up
into
benevolence
in
the
minds
of
others
and
all
of
them
will
bear
fruit
of
happiness
in
the
bosom
whence
they
spring
once
blest
are
all
the
virtues
always
twice
blest
sometimes
the
poet
rogers
used
to
tell
a
story
of
a
little
girl
a
great
favourite
with
every
one
who
knew
her
some
one
said
to
her
why
does
everybody
love
you
so
much
she
answered
i
think
it
is
because
i
love
everybody
so
much
this
little
story
is
capable
of
a
very
wide
application
for
our
happiness
as
human
beings
generally
speaking
will
be
found
to
be
very
much
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
things
we
love
and
the
number
of
things
that
love
us
and
the
greatest
worldly
success
however
honestly
achieved
will
contribute
comparatively
little
to
happiness
unless
it
be
accompanied
by
a
lively
benevolence
towards
every
human
being
kindness
is
indeed
a
great
power
in
the
world
leigh
hunt
has
truly
said
that
power
itself
hath
not
one
half
the
might
of
gentleness
men
are
always
best
governed
through
their
affections
there
is
a
french
proverb
which
says
that
les
hommes
se
prennent
par
la
douceur
and
a
coarser
english
one
to
the
effect
that
more
wasps
are
caught
by
honey
than
by
vinegar
every
act
of
kindness
says
bentham
is
in
fact
an
exercise
of
power
and
a
stock
of
friendship
laid
up
and
why
should
not
power
exercise
itself
in
the
production
of
pleasure
as
of
pain
kindness
does
not
consist
in
gifts
but
in
gentleness
and
generosity
of
spirit
men
may
give
their
money
which
comes
from
the
purse
and
withhold
their
kindness
which
comes
from
the
heart
the
kindness
that
displays
itself
in
giving
money
does
not
amount
to
much
and
often
does
quite
as
much
harm
as
good
but
the
kindness
of
true
sympathy
of
thoughtful
help
is
never
without
beneficent
results
the
good
temper
that
displays
itself
in
kindness
must
not
be
confounded
with
softness
or
silliness
in
its
best
form
it
is
not
a
merely
passive
but
an
active
condition
of
being
it
is
not
by
any
means
indifferent
but
largely
sympathetic
it
does
not
characterise
the
lowest
and
most
gelatinous
forms
of
human
life
but
those
that
are
the
most
highly
organized
true
kindness
cherishes
and
actively
promotes
all
reasonable
instrumentalities
for
doing
practical
good
in
its
own
time
and
looking
into
futurity
sees
the
same
spirit
working
on
for
the
eventual
elevation
and
happiness
of
the
race
it
is
the
men
who
are
the
active
men
of
the
world
while
the
selfish
and
the
sceptical
who
have
no
love
but
for
themselves
are
its
idlers
buffon
used
to
say
that
he
would
give
nothing
for
a
young
man
who
did
not
begin
life
with
an
enthusiasm
of
some
sort
it
showed
that
at
least
he
had
faith
in
something
good
lofty
and
generous
even
if
unattainable
egotism
scepticism
and
selfishness
are
always
miserable
companions
in
life
and
they
are
especially
unnatural
in
youth
the
egotist
is
to
a
fanatic
constantly
occupied
with
self
he
has
no
thought
to
spare
for
others
he
refers
to
himself
in
all
things
thinks
of
himself
and
studies
himself
until
his
own
little
self
becomes
his
own
little
god
worst
of
all
are
the
grumblers
and
growlers
at
fortune
who
find
that
whatever
is
is
wrong
and
will
do
nothing
to
set
matters
right
who
declare
all
to
be
barren
from
dan
even
to
beersheba
these
grumblers
are
invariably
found
the
least
efficient
helpers
in
the
school
of
life
as
the
worst
workmen
are
usually
the
readiest
to
strike
so
the
least
industrious
members
of
society
are
the
readiest
to
complain
the
worst
wheel
of
all
is
the
one
that
creaks
there
is
such
a
thing
as
the
cherishing
of
discontent
until
the
feeling
becomes
morbid
the
jaundiced
see
everything
about
them
yellow
the
think
all
things
awry
and
the
whole
world
all
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
the
little
girl
in
punch
who
found
her
doll
stuffed
with
bran
and
forthwith
declared
everything
to
be
hollow
and
wanted
to
go
into
a
nunnery
had
her
counterpart
in
real
life
many
people
are
quite
as
morbidly
unreasonable
there
are
those
who
may
be
said
to
enjoy
bad
health
they
regard
it
as
a
sort
of
property
they
can
speak
of
my
headache
my
backache
and
so
forth
until
in
course
of
time
it
becomes
their
most
cherished
possession
but
perhaps
it
is
the
source
to
them
of
much
coveted
sympathy
without
which
they
might
find
themselves
of
comparatively
little
importance
in
the
world
we
have
to
be
on
our
guard
against
small
troubles
which
by
encouraging
we
are
apt
to
magnify
into
great
ones
indeed
the
chief
source
of
worry
in
the
world
is
not
real
but
imaginary
evil
small
vexations
and
trivial
afflictions
in
the
presence
of
a
great
sorrow
all
petty
troubles
disappear
but
we
are
too
ready
to
take
some
cherished
misery
to
our
bosom
and
to
pet
it
there
very
often
it
is
the
child
of
our
fancy
and
forgetful
of
the
many
means
of
happiness
which
lie
within
our
reach
we
indulge
this
spoilt
child
of
ours
until
it
masters
us
we
shut
the
door
against
cheerfulness
and
surround
ourselves
with
gloom
the
habit
gives
a
colouring
to
our
life
we
grow
querulous
moody
and
unsympathetic
our
conversation
becomes
full
of
regrets
we
are
harsh
in
our
judgment
of
others
we
are
unsociable
and
think
everybody
else
is
so
we
make
our
breast
a
storehouse
of
pain
which
we
inflict
upon
ourselves
as
well
as
upon
others
this
disposition
is
encouraged
by
selfishness
indeed
it
is
for
the
most
part
selfishness
unmingled
without
any
admixture
of
sympathy
or
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
those
about
us
it
is
simply
wilfulness
in
the
wrong
direction
it
is
wilful
because
it
might
be
avoided
let
the
necessitarians
argue
as
they
may
freedom
of
will
and
action
is
the
possession
of
every
man
and
woman
it
is
sometimes
our
glory
and
very
often
it
is
our
shame
all
depends
upon
the
manner
in
which
it
is
used
we
can
choose
to
look
at
the
bright
side
of
things
or
at
the
dark
we
can
follow
good
and
eschew
evil
thoughts
we
can
be
wrongheaded
and
wronghearted
or
the
reverse
as
we
ourselves
determine
the
world
will
be
to
each
one
of
us
very
much
what
we
make
it
the
cheerful
are
its
real
possessors
for
the
world
belongs
to
those
who
enjoy
it
it
must
however
be
admitted
that
there
are
cases
beyond
the
reach
of
the
moralist
once
when
a
dyspeptic
called
upon
a
leading
physician
and
laid
his
case
before
him
oh
said
the
doctor
you
only
want
a
good
hearty
laugh
go
and
see
grimaldi
alas
said
the
miserable
patient
i
am
grimaldi
so
when
smollett
oppressed
by
disease
travelled
over
europe
in
the
hope
of
finding
health
he
saw
everything
through
his
own
jaundiced
eyes
i
tell
it
said
smellfungus
to
the
world
you
had
better
tell
it
said
sterne
to
your
physician
the
restless
anxious
dissatisfied
temper
that
is
ever
ready
to
run
and
meet
care
is
fatal
to
all
happiness
and
peace
of
mind
how
often
do
we
see
men
and
women
set
themselves
about
as
if
with
stiff
bristles
so
that
one
dare
scarcely
approach
them
without
fear
of
being
pricked
for
want
of
a
little
occasional
command
over
one
temper
an
amount
of
misery
is
occasioned
in
society
which
is
positively
frightful
thus
enjoyment
is
turned
into
bitterness
and
life
becomes
like
a
journey
barefooted
amongst
thorns
and
briers
and
prickles
though
sometimes
small
evils
says
richard
sharp
like
invisible
insects
inflict
great
pain
and
a
single
hair
may
stop
a
vast
machine
yet
the
chief
secret
of
comfort
lies
in
not
suffering
trifles
to
vex
us
and
in
prudently
cultivating
an
undergrowth
of
small
pleasures
since
very
few
great
ones
alas
are
let
on
long
leases
francis
de
sales
treats
the
same
topic
from
the
christian
point
of
view
how
carefully
he
says
we
should
cherish
the
little
virtues
which
spring
up
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
when
the
saint
was
asked
what
virtues
do
you
mean
he
replied
humility
patience
meekness
benignity
bearing
one
another
burden
condescension
softness
of
heart
cheerfulness
cordiality
compassion
forgiving
injuries
simplicity
candour
all
in
short
of
that
sort
of
little
virtues
they
like
unobtrusive
violets
love
the
shade
like
them
are
sustained
by
dew
and
though
like
them
they
make
little
show
they
shed
a
sweet
odour
on
all
around
and
again
he
said
if
you
would
fall
into
any
extreme
let
it
be
on
the
side
of
gentleness
the
human
mind
is
so
constructed
that
it
resists
rigour
and
yields
to
softness
a
mild
word
quenches
anger
as
water
quenches
the
rage
of
fire
and
by
benignity
any
soil
may
be
rendered
fruitful
truth
uttered
with
courtesy
is
heaping
coals
of
fire
on
the
head
or
rather
throwing
roses
in
the
face
how
can
we
resist
a
foe
whose
weapons
are
pearls
and
diamonds
meeting
evils
by
anticipation
is
not
the
way
to
overcome
them
if
we
perpetually
carry
our
burdens
about
with
us
they
will
soon
bear
us
down
under
their
load
when
evil
comes
we
must
deal
with
it
bravely
and
hopefully
what
perthes
wrote
to
a
young
man
who
seemed
to
him
inclined
to
take
trifles
as
well
as
sorrows
too
much
to
heart
was
doubtless
good
advice
go
forward
with
hope
and
confidence
this
is
the
advice
given
thee
by
an
old
man
who
has
had
a
full
share
of
the
burden
and
heat
of
life
day
we
must
ever
stand
upright
happen
what
may
and
for
this
end
we
must
cheerfully
resign
ourselves
to
the
varied
influences
of
this
life
you
may
call
this
levity
and
you
are
partly
right
for
flowers
and
colours
are
but
trifles
light
as
air
but
such
levity
is
a
constituent
portion
of
our
human
nature
without
which
it
would
sink
under
the
weight
of
time
while
on
earth
we
must
still
play
with
earth
and
with
that
which
blooms
and
fades
upon
its
breast
the
consciousness
of
this
mortal
life
being
but
the
way
to
a
higher
goal
by
no
means
precludes
our
playing
with
it
cheerfully
and
indeed
we
must
do
so
otherwise
our
energy
in
action
will
entirely
fail
cheerfulness
also
accompanies
patience
which
is
one
of
the
main
conditions
of
happiness
and
success
in
life
he
that
will
be
served
says
george
herbert
must
be
patient
it
was
said
of
the
cheerful
and
patient
king
alfred

accompanied
him

marlborough
expectant
calmness
was
great
and
a
principal
secret
of
his
success
as
a
general

all
things
he
wrote
to
godolphin
in
in
the
midst
of
a
great
emergency
while
baffled
and
opposed
by
his
allies
he
said

that

should
submit
with

last
and
chiefest
of

is
the
great
helper
of

it
has
even
been
styled
the
poor

bread
it
is
also
the
sustainer
and
inspirer
of
great
deeds
it
is
recorded
of
alexander
the
great
that
when
he
succeeded
to
the
throne
of
macedon
he
gave
away
amongst
his
friends
the
greater
part
of
the
estates
which
his
father
had
left
him
and
when
perdiccas
asked
him
what
he
reserved
for
himself
alexander
answered
the
greatest
possession
of
all
hope
the
pleasures
of
memory
however
great
are
stale
compared
with
those
of
hope
for
hope
is
the
parent
of
all
effort
and
endeavour
and
every
gift
of
noble
origin
is
breathed
upon
by
hope
perpetual
breath
it
may
be
said
to
be
the
moral
engine
that
moves
the
world
and
keeps
it
in
action
and
at
the
end
of
all
there
stands
before
us
what
robertson
of
ellon
styled
the
great
hope
if
it
were
not
for
hope
said
byron
where
would
the
future
be
in

it
is
useless
to
say
where
the
present
is
for
most
of
us
know
and
as
for
the

they

than

life

the

one
of

the

in

it

as
some
may
think
it
to
be
for

tends
greatly
to
facilitate
the

as
well
as
to
sweeten
and

social

virtue
itself
says
bishop
middleton
offends
when
coupled
with
a
forbidding
manner
manner
has
a
good
deal
to
do
with
the
estimation
in
which
men
are
held
by
the
world
and
it
has
often
more
influence
in
the
government
of
others
than
qualities
of
much
greater
depth
and
substance
a
manner
at
once
gracious
and
cordial

among

greatest
aids
to

many
there

they
are
a
passport
to
the
hearts
of
everybody
young
and

there
is
a
common
saying
that
manners
make
the
man
but
this
is
not
so
true
as
that
man
makes
the
manners
a
man
may
be
gruff
and
even
rude
and
yet
be
good
at
heart
and
of
sterling
character
yet
he
would
doubtless
be
a
much
more
agreeable
and
probably
a
much
more
useful
man
were
he
to
exhibit
that
suavity
of
disposition
and
courtesy
of
manner
which
always
gives
a
finish
to
the
true
gentleman
hutchinson
in
the
noble
portraiture
of
her
husband
to
which
we
have
already
had
occasion
to
refer
thus
describes
his
manly
courteousness
and
affability
of
disposition
i
can
not
say
whether
he
were
more
truly
magnanimous
or
less
proud
he
never
disdained
the
meanest
person
nor
flattered
the
greatest
he
had
a
loving
and
sweet
courtesy
to
the
poorest
and
would
often
employ
many
spare
hours
with
the
commonest
soldiers
and
poorest
labourers
but
still
so
ordering
his
familiarity
that
it
never
raised
them
to
a
contempt
but
entertained
still
at
the

time
a
reverence
and
love
of
him
a

manner
to
a
certain
extent

his
character
it
is
the
external
exponent
of
his
inner
nature
it
indicates
his
taste
his
feelings
and
his
temper
as
well
as
the
society
to
which
he
has
been
accustomed
there
is
a
conventional
manner
which
is
of
comparatively
little
importance
but
the
natural
manner
the
outcome
of

improved
by

which
is
a
source
of
no
slight
enjoyment
to
a
cultivated
mind
viewed
in
this
light
sentiment
is
of
almost
as
much
importance
as
talents
and
acquirements
while
it
is
even
more
influential
in
giving
the
direction
to
a
man
s
tastes
and
character
sympathy
is
the
golden
key
that
unlocks
the
hearts
of
others
it
not
only
teaches
politeness
and
courtesy
but
gives
insight
and
unfolds
wisdom
and
may
almost
be
regarded
as
the
crowning
grace
of
humanity
artificial
rules
of
politeness
are
of
very
little
use
what
passes
by
the
name
of
etiquette
is
often
of
the
essence
of
unpoliteness
and
untruthfulness
it
consists
in
a
great
measure
of
and
is
easily
seen
through
even
at
best
etiquette
is
but
a
substitute
for
good
manners
though
it
is
often
but
their
mere
counterfeit
good
manners
consist
for
the
most
part
in
courteousness
and
kindness
politeness
has
been
described
as
the
art
of
showing
by
external
signs
the
internal
regard
we
have
for
others
but
one
may
be
perfectly
polite
to
another
without
necessarily
having
a
special
regard
for
him
good
manners
are
neither
more
nor
less
than
beautiful
behaviour
it
has
been
well
said
that
a
beautiful
form
is
better
than
a
beautiful
face
and
a
beautiful
behaviour
is
better
than
a
beautiful
form
it
gives
a
higher
pleasure
than
statues
or
pictures
it
is
the
finest
of
the
fine
arts
the
truest
politeness
comes
of
sincerity
it
must
be
the
outcome
of
the
heart
or
it
will
make
no
lasting
impression
for
no
amount
of
polish
can
dispense
with
truthfulness
the
natural
character
must
be
allowed
to
appear
freed
of
its
angularities
and
asperities
though
politeness
in
its
best
form
should
francis
de
sales
says
resemble
water
best
when
clearest
most
simple
and
without
taste
yet
genius
in
a
man
will
always
cover
many
defects
of
manner
and
much
will
be
excused
to
the
strong
and
the
original
without
genuineness
and
individuality
human
life
would
lose
much
of
its
interest
and
variety
as
well
as
its
manliness
and
robustness
of
character
true
courtesy
is
kind
it
exhibits
itself
in
the
disposition
to
contribute
to
the
happiness
of
others
and
in
refraining
from
all
that
may
annoy
them
it
is
grateful
as
well
as
kind
and
readily
acknowledges
kind
actions
curiously
enough
captain
speke
found
this
quality
of
character
recognised
even
by
the
natives
of
uganda
on
the
shores
of
lake
nyanza
in
the
heart
of
africa
where
he
says
ingratitude
or
neglecting
to
thank
a
person
for
a
benefit
conferred
is
punishable
true
politeness
especially
exhibits
itself
in
regard
for
the
personality
of
others
a
man
will
respect
the
individuality
of
another
if
he
wishes
to
be
respected
himself
he
will
have
due
regard
for
his
views
and
opinions
even
though
they
differ
from
his
own
the
man
pays
a
compliment
to
another
and
sometimes
even
secures
his
respect
by
patiently
listening
to
him
he
is
simply
tolerant
and
forbearant
and
refrains
from
judging
harshly
and
harsh
judgments
of
others
will
almost
invariably
provoke
harsh
judgments
of
ourselves
the
unpolite
impulsive
man
will
however
sometimes
rather
lose
his
friend
than
his
joke
he
may
surely
be
pronounced
a
very
foolish
person
who
secures
another
hatred
at
the
price
of
a
moment
gratification
it
was
a
saying
of
brunel
the
engineer
himself
one
of
the
of
men
that
spite
and
are
among
the
most
expensive
luxuries
in

johnson
once
said
sir
a
man
has
no
more
right
to
say
an
uncivil
thing
than
to
act
one
no
more
right
to
say
a
rude
thing
to
another
than
to
knock
him
down
a
sensible
polite
person
does
not
assume
to
be
better
or
wiser
or
richer
than
his
neighbour
he
does
not
boast
of
his
rank
or
his
birth
or
his
country
or
look
down
upon
others
because
they
have
not
been
born
to
like
privileges
with
himself
he
does
not
brag
of
his
achievements
or
of
his
calling
or
talk
shop
whenever
he
opens
his
mouth
on
the
contrary
in
all
that
he
says
or
does
he
will
be
modest
unpretentious
unassuming
exhibiting
his
true
character
in
performing
rather
than
in
boasting
in
doing
rather
than
in
talking
want
of
respect
for
the
feelings
of
others
usually
originates
in
selfishness
and
issues
in
hardness
and
repulsiveness
of
manner
it
may
not
proceed
from
malignity
so
much
as
from
want
of
sympathy
and
want
of
delicacy
a
want
of
that
perception
of
and
attention
to
those
little
and
apparently
trifling
things
by
which
pleasure
is
given
or
pain
occasioned
to
others
indeed
it
may
be
said
that
in
so
to
speak
in
the
ordinary
intercourse
of
life
mainly
consists
the
difference
between
being
well
and
ill
bred
without
some
degree
of
in
society
a
man
may
be
found
almost
insufferable
no
one
has
pleasure
in
holding
intercourse
with
such
a
person
and
he
is
a
constant
source
of
annoyance
to
those
about
him
for
want
of
many
men
are
engaged
all
their
lives
in
fighting
with
difficulties
of
their
own
making
and
rendering
success
impossible
by
their
own
crossgrained
ungentleness
whilst
others
it
may
be
much
less
gifted
make
their
way
and
achieve
success
by
simple
patience
equanimity
and
it
has
been
said
that
men
succeed
in
life
quite
as
much
by
their
temper
as
by
their
talents
however
this
may
be
it
is
certain
that
their
happiness
depends
mainly
on
their
temperament
especially
upon
their
disposition
to
be
cheerful
upon
their
complaisance
kindliness
of
manner
and
willingness
to
oblige
others
details
of
conduct
which
are
like
the
in
the
intercourse
of
life
and
are
always
in
request
men
may
show
their
disregard
of
others
in
various
unpolite
ways
as
for
instance
by
neglect
of
propriety
in
dress
by
the
absence
of
cleanliness
or
by
indulging
in
repulsive
habits
the
slovenly
dirty
person
by
rendering
himself
physically
disagreeable
sets
the
tastes
and
feelings
of
others
at
defiance
and
is
rude
and
uncivil
only
under
another
form
david
ancillon
a
huguenot
preacher
of
singular
attractiveness
who
studied
and
composed
his
sermons
with
the
greatest
care
was
accustomed
to
say
that
it
was
showing
too
little
esteem
for
the
public
to
take
no
pains
in
preparation
and
that
a
man
who
should
appear
on
a
in
his
nightcap
and
could
not
commit
a
greater
breach
of
civility
the
perfection
of
manner
is
ease
that
it
attracts
no
man
notice
as
such
but
is
natural
and
unaffected
artifice
is
incompatible
with
courteous
frankness
of
manner
rochefoucauld
has
said
that
nothing
so
much
prevents
our
being
natural
as
the
desire
of
appearing
so
thus
we
come
round
again
to
sincerity
and
truthfulness
which
find
their
outward
expression
in
graciousness
urbanity
kindliness
and
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
others
the
frank
and
cordial
man
sets
those
about
him
at
their
ease
he
warms
and
elevates
them
by
his
presence
and
wins
all
hearts
thus
manner
in
its
highest
form
like
character
becomes
a
genuine
motive
power
the
love
and
admiration
says
canon
kingsley
which
that
truly
brave
and
loving
man
sir
sydney
smith
won
from
every
one
rich
and
poor
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
seems
to
have
arisen
from
the
one
fact
that
without
perhaps
having
any
such
conscious
intention
he
treated
rich
and
poor
his
own
servants
and
the
noblemen
his
guests
alike
and
alike
courteously
considerately
cheerfully
affectionately
so
leaving
a
blessing
and
reaping
a
blessing
wherever
he
went
good
manners
are
usually
supposed
to
be
the
peculiar
characteristic
of
persons
gently
born
and
bred
and
of
persons
moving
in
the
higher
rather
than
in
the
lower
spheres
of
society
and
this
is
no
doubt
to
a
great
extent
true
because
of
the
more
favourable
surroundings
of
the
former
in
early
life
but
there
is
no
reason
why
the
poorest
classes
should
not
practise
good
manners
towards
each
other
as
well
as
the
richest
men
who
toil
with
their
hands
equally
with
those
who
do
not
may
respect
themselves
and
respect
one
another
and
it
is
by
their
demeanour
to
each
other
in
other
words
by
their
manners
that
as
well
as
mutual
respect
are
indicated
there
is
scarcely
a
moment
in
their
lives
the
enjoyment
of
which
might
not
be
enhanced
by
kindliness
of
this
sort
in
the
workshop
in
the
street
or
at
home
the
civil
workman
will
exercise
increased
power
amongst
his
class
and
gradually
induce
them
to
imitate
him
by
his
persistent
steadiness
civility
and
kindness
thus
benjamin
franklin
when
a
is
said
to
have
reformed
the
habits
of
an
entire
workshop
one
may
be
polite
and
gentle
with
very
little
money
in
his
purse
politeness
goes
far
yet
costs
nothing
it
is
the
cheapest
of
all
commodities
it
is
the
humblest
of
the
fine
arts
yet
it
is
so
useful
and
so
that
it
might
almost
be
ranked
amongst
the
humanities
every
nation
may
learn
something
of
others
and
if
there
be
one
thing
more
than
another
that
the
english
might
afford
to
copy
with
advantage
from
their
continental
neighbours
it
is
their
politeness
the
french
and
germans
of
even
the
humblest
classes
are
gracious
in
manner
complaisant
cordial
and
the
foreign
workman
lifts
his
cap
and
respectfully
salutes
his
in
passing
there
is
no
sacrifice
of
manliness
in
this
but
grace
and
dignity
even
the
lowest
poverty
of
the
foreign
workpeople
is
not
misery
simply
because
it
is
cheerful
though
not
receiving
the
income
which
our
do
they
do
not
sink
into
wretchedness
and
drown
their
troubles
in
drink
but
contrive
to
make
the
best
of
life
and
to
enjoy
it
even
amidst
poverty
good
taste
is
a
true
economist
it
may
be
practised
on
small
means
and
sweeten
the
lot
of
labour
as
well
as
of
ease
it
is
all
the
more
enjoyed
indeed
when
associated
with
industry
and
the
performance
of
duty
even
the
lot
of
poverty
is
elevated
by
taste
it
exhibits
itself
in
the
economies
of
the
household
it
gives
brightness
and
grace
to
the
humblest
dwelling
it
produces
refinement
it
engenders
goodwill
and
creates
an
atmosphere
of
cheerfulness
thus
good
taste
associated
with
kindliness
sympathy
and
intelligence
may
elevate
and
adorn
even
the
lowliest
lot
the
first
and
best
school
of
manners
as
of
character
is
always
the
home
where
woman
is
the
teacher
the
manners
of
society
at
large
are
but
the
reflex
of
the
manners
of
our
collective
homes
neither
better
nor
worse
yet
with
all
the
disadvantages
of
ungenial
homes
men
may
practise
of
manner
as
of
intellect
and
learn
by
good
examples
to
cultivate
a
graceful
and
agreeable
behaviour
towards
others
most
men
are
like
so
many
gems
in
the
rough
which
need
polishing
by
contact
with
other
and
better
natures
to
bring
out
their
full
beauty
and
lustre
some
have
but
one
side
polished
sufficient
only
to
show
the
delicate
graining
of
the
interior
but
to
bring
out
the
full
qualities
of
the
gem
needs
the
discipline
of
experience
and
contact
with
the
best
examples
of
character
in
the
intercourse
of
daily
life
a
good
deal
of
the
success
of
manner
consists
in
tact
and
it
is
because
women
on
the
whole
have
greater
tact
than
men
that
they
prove
its
most
influential
teachers
they
have
more
than
men
and
are
naturally
more
gracious
and
polite
they
possess
an
intuitive
quickness
and
readiness
of
action
have
a
keener
insight
into
character
and
exhibit
greater
discrimination
and
address
in
matters
of
social
detail
aptness
and
dexterity
come
to
them
like
nature
and
hence
men
usually
receive
their
best
culture
by
mixing
in
the
society
of
gentle
and
adroit
women
tact
is
an
intuitive
art
of
manner
which
carries
one
through
a
difficulty
better
than
either
talent
or
knowledge
talent
says
a
public
writer
is
power
tact
is
skill
talent
is
weight
tact
is
momentum
talent
knows
what
to
do
tact
knows
how
to
do
it
talent
makes
a
man
respectable
tact
makes
him
respected
talent
is
wealth
tact
is
the
difference
between
a
man
of
quick
tact
and
of
no
tact
whatever
was
exemplified
in
an
interview
which
once
took
place
between
lord
palmerston
and
behnes
the
sculptor
at
the
last
sitting
which
lord
palmerston
gave
him
behnes
opened
the
conversation
with
any
news
my
lord
from
france
how
do
we
stand
with
louis
napoleon
the
foreign
secretary
raised
his
eyebrows
for
an
instant
and
quietly
replied
really
behnes
i
do
know
i
have
not
seen
the
newspapers
poor
behnes
with
many
excellent
qualities
and
much
real
talent
was
one
of
the
many
men
who
entirely
missed
their
way
in
life
through
want
of
tact
such
is
the
power
of
manner
combined
with
tact
that
wilkes
one
of
the
ugliest
of
men
used
to
say
that
in
winning
the
graces
of
a
lady
there
was
not
more
than
three
days
difference
between
him
and
the
handsomest
man
in
england
but
this
reference
to
wilkes
reminds
us
that
too
much
importance
must
not
be
attached
to
manner
for
it
does
not
afford
any
genuine
test
of
character
the
man
may
like
wilkes
be
merely
acting
a
part
and
that
for
an
immoral
purpose
manner
like
other
fine
arts
gives
pleasure
and
is
exceedingly
agreeable
to
look
upon
but
it
may
be
assumed
as
a
disguise
as
men
assume
a
virtue
though
they
have
it
not
it
is
but
the
exterior
sign
of
good
conduct
but
may
be
no
more
than
the
most
person
may
be
thoroughly
depraved
in
heart
and
his
superfine
manners
may
after
all
only
consist
in
pleasing
gestures
and
in
fine
phrases
on
the
other
hand
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
some
of
the
richest
and
most
generous
natures
have
been
wanting
in
the
graces
of
courtesy
and
politeness
as
a
rough
rind
sometimes
covers
the
sweetest
fruit
so
a
rough
exterior
often
conceals
a
kindly
and
hearty
nature
the
blunt
man
may
seem
even
rude
in
manner
and
yet
at
heart
be
honest
kind
and
gentle
john
knox
and
martin
luther
were
by
no
means
distinguished
for
their
urbanity
they
had
work
to
do
which
needed
strong
and
determined
rather
than
men
indeed
they
were
both
thought
to
be
unnecessarily
harsh
and
violent
in
their
manner
and
who
art
thou
said
mary
queen
of
scots
to
knox
that
presumest
to
school
the
nobles
and
sovereign
of
this
realm
madam
replied
knox
a
subject
born
within
the
same
it
is
said
that
his
boldness
or
roughness
more
than
once
made
queen
mary
weep
when
regent
morton
heard
of
this
he
said
well
is
better
that
women
should
weep
than
bearded
men
as
knox
was
retiring
from
the
queen
presence
on
one
occasion
he
overheard
one
of
the
royal
attendants
say
to
another
he
is
not
afraid
turning
round
upon
them
he
said
and
why
should
the
pleasing
face
of
a
gentleman
frighten
me
i
have
looked
on
the
faces
of
angry
men
and
yet
have
not
been
afraid
beyond
measure
when
the
reformer
by
excess
of
labour
and
anxiety
was
at
length
laid
to
his
rest
the
regent
looking
down
into
the
open
grave
exclaimed
in
words
which
made
a
strong
impression
from
their
aptness
and
truth
there
lies
he
who
never
feared
the
face
of
man
luther
also
was
thought
by
some
to
be
a
mere
compound
of
violence
and
ruggedness
but
as
in
the
case
of
knox
the
times
in
which
he
lived
were
rude
and
violent
and
the
work
he
had
to
do
could
scarcely
have
been
accomplished
with
gentleness
and
suavity
to
rouse
europe
from
its
lethargy
he
had
to
speak
and
to
write
with
force
and
even
vehemence
yet
luther
vehemence
was
only
in
words
his
apparently
rude
exterior
covered
a
warm
heart
in
private
life
he
was
gentle
loving
and
affectionate
he
was
simple
and
homely
even
to
commonness
fond
of
all
common
pleasures
and
enjoyments
he
was
anything
but
an
austere
man
or
a
bigot
for
he
was
hearty
genial
and
even
jolly
luther
was
the
common
people
hero
in
his
lifetime
and
he
remains
so
in
germany
to
this
day
samuel
johnson
was
rude
and
often
gruff
in
manner
but
he
had
been
brought
up
in
a
rough
school
poverty
in
early
life
had
made
him
acquainted
with
strange
companions
he
had
wandered
in
the
streets
with
savage
for
nights
together
unable
between
them
to
raise
money
enough
to
pay
for
a
bed
when
his
indomitable
courage
and
industry
at
length
secured
for
him
a
footing
in
society
he
still
bore
upon
him
the
scars
of
his
early
sorrows
and
struggles
he
was
by
nature
strong
and
robust
and
his
experience
made
him
unaccommodating
and
when
he
was
once
asked
why
he
was
not
invited
to
dine
out
as
garrick
was
he
answered
because
great
lords
and
ladies
did
not
like
to
have
their
mouths
stopped
and
johnson
was
a
notorious
though
what
he
said
was
always
worth
listening
to
johnson
companions
spoke
of
him
as
ursa
major
but
as
goldsmith
generously
said
of
him
no
man
alive
has
a
more
tender
heart
he
has
nothing
of
the
bear
about
him
but
his
skin
the
kindliness
of
nature
was
shown
on
one
occasion
by
the
manner
in
which
he
assisted
a
supposed
lady
in
crossing
fleet
street
he
gave
her
his
arm
and
led
her
across
not
observing
that
she
was
in
liquor
at
the
time
but
the
spirit
of
the
act
was
not
the
less
kind
on
that
account
on
the
other
hand
the
conduct
of
the
bookseller
on
whom
johnson
once
called
to
solicit
employment
and
who
regarding
his
athletic
but
uncouth
person
told
him
he
had
better
go
buy
a
porter
knot
and
carry
trunks
in
howsoever
bland
tones
the
advice
might
have
been
communicated
was
simply
brutal
while
captiousness
of
manner
and
the
habit
of
disputing
and
contradicting
everything
said
is
chilling
and
repulsive
the
opposite
habit
of
assenting
to
and
sympathising
with
every
statement
made
or
emotion
expressed
is
almost
equally
disagreeable
it
is
unmanly
and
is
felt
to
be
dishonest
it
may
seem
difficult
says
richard
sharp
to
steer
always
between
bluntness
and
between
giving
merited
praise
and
lavishing
indiscriminate
flattery
but
it
is
very
easy
kindheartedness
and
perfect
simplicity
being
all
that
are
requisite
to
do
what
is
right
in
the
right
way
at
the
same
time
many
are
unpolite
not
because
they
mean
to
be
so
but
because
they
are
awkward
and
perhaps
know
no
better
thus
when
gibbon
had
published
the
second
and
third
volumes
of
his
and
fall
the
duke
of
cumberland
met
him
one
day
and
accosted
him
with
how
do
you
do
gibbon
i
see
you
are
always
at
it
in
the
old
way
scribble
scribble
scribble
the
duke
probably
intended
to
pay
the
author
a
compliment
but
did
not
know
how
better
to
do
it
than
in
this
blunt
and
apparently
rude
way
again
many
persons
are
thought
to
be
stiff
reserved
and
proud
when
they
are
only
shy
shyness
is
characteristic
of
most
people
of
teutonic
race
it
has
been
styled
the
english
mania
but
it
pervades
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
all
the
northern
nations
the
ordinary
englishman
when
he
travels
abroad
carries
his
shyness
with
him
he
is
stiff
awkward
ungraceful
undemonstrative
and
apparently
unsympathetic
and
though
he
may
assume
a
brusqueness
of
manner
the
shyness
is
there
and
can
not
be
wholly
concealed
the
naturally
graceful
and
intensely
social
french
can
not
understand
such
a
character
and
the
englishman
is
their
standing
joke
the
subject
of
their
most
ludicrous
caricatures
george
sand
attributes
the
rigidity
of
the
natives
of
albion
to
a
stock
of
fluide
britannique
which
they
carry
about
with
them
that
renders
them
impassive
under
all
circumstances
and
as
impervious
to
the
atmosphere
of
the
regions
they
traverse
as
a
mouse
in
the
centre
of
an
exhausted
receiver
the
average
frenchman
or
irishman
excels
the
average
englishman
german
or
american
in
courtesy
and
ease
of
manner
simply
because
it
is
his
nature
they
are
more
social
and
less
than
men
of
teutonic
origin
more
demonstrative
and
less
reticent
they
are
more
communicative
conversational
and
freer
in
their
intercourse
with
each
other
in
all
respects
whilst
men
of
german
race
are
comparatively
stiff
reserved
shy
and
awkward
at
the
same
time
a
people
may
exhibit
ease
gaiety
and
sprightliness
of
character
and
yet
possess
no
deeper
qualities
calculated
to
inspire
respect
they
may
have
every
grace
of
manner
and
yet
be
heartless
frivolous
selfish
the
character
may
be
on
the
surface
only
and
without
any
solid
qualities
for
a
foundation
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
which
of
the
two
sorts
of
people
the
easy
and
graceful
or
the
stiff
and
awkward
it
is
most
agreeable
to
meet
either
in
business
in
society
or
in
the
casual
intercourse
of
life
which
make
the
fastest
friends
the
truest
men
of
their
word
the
most
conscientious
performers
of
their
duty
is
an
entirely
different
matter
the
dry
gauche
englishman
to
use
the
french
phrase
empetre
is
certainly
a
somewhat
disagreeable
person
to
meet
at
first
he
looks
as
if
he
had
swallowed
a
poker
he
is
shy
himself
and
the
cause
of
shyness
in
others
he
is
stiff
not
because
he
is
proud
but
because
he
is
shy
and
he
can
not
shake
it
off
even
if
he
would
indeed
we
should
not
be
surprised
to
find
that
even
the
clever
writer
who
describes
the
english
philistine
in
all
his
enormity
of
awkward
manner
and
absence
of
grace
were
himself
as
shy
as
a
bat
when
two
shy
men
meet
they
seem
like
a
couple
of
icicles
they
sidle
away
and
turn
their
backs
on
each
other
in
a
room
or
when
travelling
creep
into
the
opposite
corners
of
a
when
shy
englishmen
are
about
to
start
on
a
journey
by
railway
they
walk
along
the
train
to
discover
an
empty
compartment
in
which
to
bestow
themselves
and
when
once
ensconced
they
inwardly
hate
the
next
man
who
comes
in
so
on
entering
the
of
their
club
each
shy
man
looks
out
for
an
unoccupied
table
until
sometimes
all
the
tables
in
the
room
are
occupied
by
single
diners
all
this
apparent
unsociableness
is
merely
shyness
the
national
characteristic
of
the
englishman
the
disciples
of
confucius
observes
arthur
helps
say
that
when
in
the
presence
of
the
prince
his
manner
displayed
respectful
uneasiness
there
could
hardly
be
given
any
two
words
which
more
fitly
describe
the
manner
of
most
englishmen
when
in
society
perhaps
it
is
due
to
this
feeling
that
sir
henry
taylor
in
his
recommends
that
in
the
management
of
interviews
the
minister
should
be
as
near
to
the
door
as
possible
and
instead
of
bowing
his
visitor
out
that
he
should
take
refuge
at
the
end
of
an
interview
in
the
adjoining
room
timid
and
embarrassed
men
he
says
will
sit
as
if
they
were
rooted
to
the
spot
when
they
are
conscious
that
they
have
to
traverse
the
length
of
a
room
in
their
retreat
in
every
case
an
interview
will
find
a
more
easy
and
pleasing
termination
when
the
door
is
at
hand
as
the
last
words
are
spoken
the
late
prince
albert
one
of
the
gentlest
and
most
amiable
was
also
one
of
the
most
retiring
of
men
he
struggled
much
against
his
sense
of
shyness
but
was
never
able
either
to
conquer
or
conceal
it
his
biographer
in
explaining
its
causes
says
it
was
the
shyness
of
a
very
delicate
nature
that
is
not
sure
it
will
please
and
is
without
the
confidence
and
the
vanity
which
often
go
to
form
characters
that
are
outwardly
more
genial
but
the
prince
shared
this
defect
with
some
of
the
greatest
of
englishmen
sir
isaac
newton
was
probably
the
shyest
man
of
his
age
he
kept
secret
for
a
time
some
of
his
greatest
discoveries
for
fear
of
the
notoriety
they
might
bring
him
his
discovery
of
the
binomial
theorem
and
its
most
important
applications
as
well
as
his
still
greater
discovery
of
the
law
of
gravitation
were
not
published
for
years
after
they
were
made
and
when
he
communicated
to
collins
his
solution
of
the
theory
of
the
moon
rotation
round
the
earth
he
forbade
him
to
insert
his
name
in
connection
with
it
in
the
transactions
saying
it
would
perhaps
increase
my
acquaintance
the
thing
which
i
chiefly
study
to
decline
from
all
that
can
be
learnt
of
shakspeare
it
is
to
be
inferred
that
he
was
an
exceedingly
shy
man
the
manner
in
which
his
plays
were
sent
into
the
world
for
it
is
not
known
that
he
edited
or
authorized
the
publication
of
a
single
one
of
them
and
the
dates
at
which
they
respectively
appeared
are
mere
matters
of
conjecture
his
appearance
in
his
own
plays
in
second
and
even
parts
his
indifference
to
reputation
and
even
his
apparent
aversion
to
be
held
in
repute
by
his
contemporaries
his
disappearance
from
london
seat
and
centre
of
english
histrionic
art
so
soon
as
he
had
realised
a
moderate
competency
and
his
retirement
about
the
age
of
forty
for
the
remainder
of
his
days
to
a
life
of
obscurity
in
a
small
town
in
the
midland
counties
all
seem
to
unite
in
proving
the
shrinking
nature
of
the
man
and
his
unconquerable
shyness
it
is
also
probable
that
besides
being
shy
and
his
shyness
may
like
that
of
byron
have
been
increased
by
his
limp
shakspeare
did
not
possess
in
any
high
degree
the
gift
of
hope
it
is
a
remarkable
circumstance
that
whilst
the
great
dramatist
has
in
the
course
of
his
writings
copiously
illustrated
all
other
gifts
affections
and
virtues
the
passages
are
very
rare
in
which
hope
is
mentioned
and
then
it
is
usually
in
a
desponding
and
despairing
tone
as
when
he
says
the
miserable
hath
no
other
medicine
but
only
hope
many
of
his
sonnets
breathe
the
spirit
of
despair
and
hopelessness
he
laments
his
lameness
apologizes
for
his
profession
as
an
actor
expresses
his
fear
of
trust
in
himself
and
his
hopeless
perhaps
misplaced
affection
anticipates
a
coffin
doom
and
utters
his
profoundly
pathetic
cry
for
restful
death
it
might
naturally
be
supposed
that
shakspeare
profession
of
an
actor
and
his
repeated
appearances
in
public
would
speedily
overcome
his
shyness
did
such
exist
but
inborn
shyness
when
strong
is
not
so
easily
conquered
who
could
have
believed
that
the
late
charles
mathews
who
entertained
crowded
houses
night
after
night
was
naturally
one
of
the
shyest
of
men
he
would
even
make
long
circuits
though
he
was
along
the
byelanes
of
london
to
avoid
recognition
his
wife
says
of
him
that
he
looked
sheepish
and
confused
if
recognised
and
that
his
eyes
would
fall
and
his
colour
would
mount
if
he
heard
his
name
even
whispered
in
passing
along
the
streets
nor
would
it
at
first
sight
have
been
supposed
that
lord
byron
was
affected
with
shyness
and
yet
he
was
a
victim
to
it
his
biographer
relating
that
while
on
a
visit
to
pigot
at
southwell
when
he
saw
strangers
approaching
he
would
instantly
jump
out
of
the
window
and
escape
on
to
the
lawn
to
avoid
them
but
a
still
more
recent
and
striking
instance
is
that
of
the
late
archbishop
whately
who
in
the
early
part
of
his
life
was
painfully
oppressed
by
the
sense
of
shyness
when
at
oxford
his
white
rough
coat
and
white
hat
obtained
for
him
the
soubriquet
of
the
white
bear
and
his
manners
according
to
his
own
account
of
himself
corresponded
with
the
appellation
he
was
directed
by
way
of
remedy
to
copy
the
example
of
the
men
he
met
in
society
but
the
attempt
to
do
this
only
increased
his
shyness
and
he
failed
he
found
that
he
was
all
the
while
thinking
of
himself
rather
than
of
others
whereas
thinking
of
others
rather
than
of
one
self
is
of
the
true
essence
of
politeness
finding
that
he
was
making
no
progress
whately
was
driven
to
utter
despair
and
then
he
said
to
himself
why
should
i
endure
this
torture
all
my
life
to
no
purpose
i
would
bear
it
still
if
there
was
any
success
to
be
hoped
for
but
since
there
is
not
i
will
die
quietly
without
taking
any
more
doses
i
have
tried
my
very
utmost
and
find
that
i
must
be
as
awkward
as
a
bear
all
my
life
in
spite
of
it
i
will
endeavour
to
think
as
little
about
it
as
a
bear
and
make
up
my
mind
to
endure
what
ca
be
cured
from
this
time
forth
he
struggled
to
shake
off
all
consciousness
as
to
manner
and
to
disregard
censure
as
much
as
possible
in
adopting
this
course
he
says
i
succeeded
beyond
my
expectations
for
i
not
only
got
rid
of
the
personal
suffering
of
shyness
but
also
of
most
of
those
faults
of
manner
which
consciousness
produces
and
acquired
at
once
an
easy
and
natural
manner
careless
indeed
in
the
extreme
from
its
originating
in
a
stern
defiance
of
opinion
which
i
had
convinced
myself
must
be
ever
against
me
rough
and
awkward
for
smoothness
and
grace
are
quite
out
of
my
way
and
of
course
tutorially
pedantic
but
unconscious
and
therefore
giving
expression
to
that
goodwill
towards
men
which
i
really
feel
and
these
i
believe
are
the
main
points
washington
who
was
an
englishman
in
his
lineage
was
also
one
in
his
shyness
he
is
described
incidentally
by
josiah
quincy
as
a
little
stiff
in
his
person
not
a
little
formal
in
his
manner
and
not
particularly
at
ease
in
the
presence
of
strangers
he
had
the
air
of
a
country
gentleman
not
accustomed
to
mix
much
in
society
perfectly
polite
but
not
easy
in
his
address
and
conversation
and
not
graceful
in
his
movements
although
we
are
not
accustomed
to
think
of
modern
americans
as
shy
the
most
distinguished
american
author
of
our
time
was
probably
the
shyest
of
men
nathaniel
hawthorne
was
shy
to
the
extent
of
morbidity
we
have
observed
him
when
a
stranger
entered
the
room
where
he
was
turn
his
back
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
recognition
and
yet
when
the
crust
of
his
shyness
was
broken
no
man
could
be
more
cordial
and
genial
than
hawthorne
we
observe
a
remark
in
one
of
hawthorne
that
on
one
occasion
he
met
mr
helps
in
society
and
found
him
cold
and
doubtless
mr
helps
thought
the
same
of
him
it
was
only
the
case
of
two
shy
men
meeting
each
thinking
the
other
stiff
and
reserved
and
parting
before
their
mutual
film
of
shyness
had
been
removed
by
a
little
friendly
intercourse
before
pronouncing
a
hasty
judgment
in
such
cases
it
would
be
well
to
bear
in
mind
the
motto
of
helvetius
which
bentham
says
proved
such
a
real
treasure
to
him
pour
aimer
les
hommes
il
faut
attendre
peu
we
have
thus
far
spoken
of
shyness
as
a
defect
but
there
is
another
way
of
looking
at
it
for
even
shyness
has
its
bright
side
and
contains
an
element
of
good
shy
men
and
shy
races
are
ungraceful
and
undemonstrative
because
as
regards
society
at
large
they
are
comparatively
unsociable
they
do
not
possess
those
elegances
of
manner
acquired
by
free
intercourse
which
distinguish
the
social
races
because
their
tendency
is
to
shun
society
rather
than
to
seek
it
they
are
shy
in
the
presence
of
strangers
and
shy
even
in
their
own
families
they
hide
their
affections
under
a
robe
of
reserve
and
when
they
do
give
way
to
their
feelings
it
is
only
in
some
very
hidden
and
yet
the
feelings
are
there
and
not
the
less
healthy
and
genuine
that
they
are
not
made
the
subject
of
exhibition
to
others
it
was
not
a
little
characteristic
of
the
ancient
germans
that
the
more
social
and
demonstrative
peoples
by
whom
they
were
surrounded
should
have
characterised
them
as
the
niemec
or
dumb
men
and
the
same
designation
might
equally
apply
to
the
modern
english
as
compared
for
example
with
their
nimbler
more
communicative
and
vocal
and
in
all
respects
more
social
neighbours
the
modern
french
and
irish
but
there
is
one
characteristic
which
marks
the
english
people
as
it
did
the
races
from
which
they
have
mainly
sprung
and
that
is
their
intense
love
of
home
give
the
englishman
a
home
and
he
is
comparatively
indifferent
to
society
for
the
sake
of
a
holding
which
he
can
call
his
own
he
will
cross
the
seas
plant
himself
on
the
prairie
or
amidst
the
primeval
forest
and
make
for
himself
a
home
the
solitude
of
the
wilderness
has
no
fears
for
him
the
society
of
his
wife
and
family
is
sufficient
and
he
cares
for
no
other
hence
it
is
that
the
people
of
germanic
origin
from
whom
the
english
and
americans
have
alike
sprung
make
the
best
of
colonizers
and
are
now
rapidly
extending
themselves
as
emigrants
and
settlers
in
all
parts
of
the
habitable
globe
the
french
have
never
made
any
progress
as
colonizers
mainly
because
of
their
intense
social
instincts
the
secret
of
their
graces
of
manner
and
because
they
can
never
forget
that
they
are
frenchmen
it
seemed
at
one
time
within
the
limits
of
probability
that
the
french
would
occupy
the
greater
part
of
the
north
american
continent
from
lower
canada
their
line
of
forts
extended
up
the
lawrence
and
from
fond
du
lac
on
lake
superior
along
the
river
croix
all
down
the
mississippi
to
its
mouth
at
new
orleans
but
the
great
industrious
niemec
from
a
fringe
of
settlements
along
the
seacoast
silently
extended
westward
settling
and
planting
themselves
everywhere
solidly
upon
the
soil
and
nearly
all
that
now
remains
of
the
original
french
occupation
of
america
is
the
french
colony
of
acadia
in
lower
canada
and
even
there
we
find
one
of
the
most
striking
illustrations
of
that
intense
sociability
of
the
french
which
keeps
them
together
and
prevents
their
spreading
over
and
planting
themselves
firmly
in
a
new
country
as
it
is
the
instinct
of
the
men
of
teutonic
race
to
do
while
in
upper
canada
the
colonists
of
english
and
scotch
descent
penetrate
the
forest
and
the
wilderness
each
settler
living
it
may
be
miles
apart
from
his
nearest
neighbour
the
lower
canadians
of
french
descent
continue
clustered
together
in
villages
usually
consisting
of
a
line
of
houses
on
either
side
of
the
road
behind
which
extend
their
long
strips
of
divided
and
subdivided
to
an
extreme
tenuity
they
willingly
submit
to
all
the
inconveniences
of
this
method
of
farming
for
the
sake
of
each
other
society
rather
than
betake
themselves
to
the
solitary
backwoods
as
english
germans
and
americans
so
readily
do
indeed
not
only
does
the
american
backwoodsman
become
accustomed
to
solitude
but
he
prefers
it
and
in
the
western
states
when
settlers
come
too
near
him
and
the
country
seems
to
become
overcrowded
he
retreats
before
the
advance
of
society
and
packing
up
his
things
in
a
waggon
he
sets
out
cheerfully
with
his
wife
and
family
to
found
for
himself
a
new
home
in
the
far
west
thus
the
teuton
because
of
his
very
shyness
is
the
true
colonizer
english
scotch
germans
and
americans
are
alike
ready
to
accept
solitude
provided
they
can
but
establish
a
home
and
maintain
a
family
thus
their
comparative
indifference
to
society
has
tended
to
spread
this
race
over
the
earth
to
till
and
to
subdue
it
while
the
intense
social
instincts
of
the
french
though
issuing
in
much
greater
gracefulness
of
manner
has
stood
in
their
way
as
colonizers
so
that
in
the
countries
in
which
they
have
planted
themselves
as
in
algiers
and
elsewhere
they
have
remained
little
more
than
garrisons
there
are
other
qualities
besides
these
which
grow
out
of
the
comparative
unsociableness
of
the
englishman
his
shyness
throws
him
back
upon
himself
and
renders
him
and
society
not
being
essential
to
his
happiness
he
takes
refuge
in
reading
in
study
in
invention
or
he
finds
pleasure
in
industrial
work
and
becomes
the
best
of
mechanics
he
does
not
fear
to
entrust
himself
to
the
solitude
of
the
ocean
and
he
becomes
a
fisherman
a
sailor
a
discoverer
since
the
early
northmen
scoured
the
northern
seas
discovered
america
and
sent
their
fleets
along
the
shores
of
europe
and
up
the
mediterranean
the
seamanship
of
the
men
of
teutonic
race
has
always
been
in
the
ascendant
the
english
are
inartistic
for
the
same
reason
that
they
are
unsociable
they
may
make
good
colonists
sailors
and
mechanics
but
they
do
not
make
good
singers
dancers
actors
artistes
or
modistes
they
neither
dress
well
act
well
speak
well
nor
write
well
they
want
style
they
want
elegance
what
they
have
to
do
they
do
in
a
straightforward
manner
but
without
grace
this
was
strikingly
exhibited
at
an
international
cattle
exhibition
held
at
paris
a
few
years
ago
at
the
close
of
the
exhibition
the
competitors
came
up
with
the
prize
animals
to
receive
the
prizes
first
came
a
gay
and
gallant
spaniard
a
magnificent
man
beautifully
dressed
who
received
a
prize
of
the
lowest
class
with
an
air
and
attitude
that
would
have
become
a
grandee
of
the
highest
order
then
came
frenchmen
and
italians
full
of
grace
politeness
and
chic
themselves
elegantly
dressed
and
their
animals
decorated
to
the
horns
with
flowers
and
coloured
ribbons
harmoniously
blended
and
last
of
all
came
the
exhibitor
who
was
to
receive
the
first
prize
a
slouching
man
plainly
dressed
with
a
pair
of
farmer
gaiters
on
and
without
even
a
flower
in
his
buttonhole
who
is
he
asked
the
spectators
why
he
is
the
englishman
was
the
reply
the
englishman
that
the
representative
of
a
great
country
was
the
general
exclamation
but
it
was
the
englishman
all
over
he
was
sent
there
not
to
exhibit
himself
but
to
show
the
best
beast
and
he
did
it
carrying
away
the
first
prize
yet
he
would
have
been
nothing
the
worse
for
the
flower
in
his
buttonhole
to
remedy
this
admitted
defect
of
grace
and
want
of
artistic
taste
in
the
english
people
a
school
has
sprung
up
amongst
us
for
the
more
general
diffusion
of
fine
art
the
beautiful
has
now
its
teachers
and
preachers
and
by
some
it
is
almost
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
religion
the
beautiful
is
the
good
the
beautiful
is
the
true
the
beautiful
is
the
priest
of
the
benevolent
are
among
their
texts
it
is
believed
that
by
the
study
of
art
the
tastes
of
the
people
may
be
improved
that
by
contemplating
objects
of
beauty
their
nature
will
become
purified
and
that
by
being
thereby
withdrawn
from
sensual
enjoyments
their
character
will
be
refined
and
elevated
but
though
such
culture
is
calculated
to
be
elevating
and
purifying
in
a
certain
degree
we
must
not
expect
too
much
from
it
grace
is
a
sweetener
and
embellisher
of
life
and
as
such
is
worthy
of
cultivation
music
painting
dancing
and
the
fine
arts
are
all
sources
of
pleasure
and
though
they
may
not
be
sensual
yet
they
are
sensuous
and
often
nothing
more
the
cultivation
of
a
taste
for
beauty
of
form
or
colour
of
sound
or
attitude
has
no
necessary
effect
upon
the
cultivation
of
the
mind
or
the
development
of
the
character
the
contemplation
of
fine
works
of
art
will
doubtless
improve
the
taste
and
excite
admiration
but
a
single
noble
action
done
in
the
sight
of
men
will
more
influence
the
mind
and
stimulate
the
character
to
imitation
than
the
sight
of
miles
of
statuary
or
acres
of
pictures
for
it
is
mind
soul
and
heart
not
taste
or
art
that
make
men
great
it
is
indeed
doubtful
whether
the
cultivation
of
art
which
usually
ministers
to
luxury
has
done
so
much
for
human
progress
as
is
generally
supposed
it
is
even
possible
that
its
too
exclusive
culture
may
effeminate
rather
than
strengthen
the
character
by
laying
it
more
open
to
the
temptations
of
the
senses
it
is
the
nature
of
the
imaginative
temperament
cultivated
by
the

says
sir
henry
taylor
to
undermine
the

and
by
abating
strength
of
character
to
render
men
more

the
gift
of
the
artist
greatly
differs
from
that
of
the
thinker
his
highest
idea
is
to
mould
his
subject
whether
it
be
of
painting
or
music
or
literature
into
that
perfect
grace
of
form
in
which
thought
may
not
be
of
the
deepest
finds
its
apotheosis
and
immortality
art
has
usually
flourished
most
during
the
decadence
of
nations
when
it
has
been
hired
by
wealth
as
the
minister
of
luxury
exquisite
art
and
degrading
corruption
were
contemporary
in
greece
as
well
as
in
rome
phidias
and
iktinos
had
scarcely
completed
the
parthenon
when
the
glory
of
athens
had
departed
phidias
died
in
prison
and
the
spartans
set
up
in
the
city
the
memorials
of
their
own
triumph
and
of
athenian
defeat
it
was
the
same
in
ancient
rome
where
art
was
at
its
greatest
height
when
the
people
were
in
their
most
degraded
condition
nero
was
an
artist
as
well
as
domitian
two
of
the
greatest
monsters
of
the
empire
if
the
beautiful
had
been
the
good
commodus
must
have
been
one
of
the
best
of
men
but
according
to
history
he
was
one
of
the
worst
again
the
greatest
period
of
modern
roman
art
was
that
in
which
pope
leo
flourished
of
whose
reign
it
has
been
said
that
profligacy
and
licentiousness
prevailed
amongst
the
people
and
clergy
as
they
had
done
almost
uncontrolled
ever
since
the
pontificate
of
alexander
vi
in
like
manner
the
period
at
which
art
reached
its
highest
point
in
the
low
countries
was
that
which
immediately
succeeded
the
destruction
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
and
the
prostration
of
the
national
life
under
the
despotism
of
spain
if
art
could
elevate
a
nation
and
the
contemplation
of
the
beautiful
were
calculated
to
make
men
the
good
then
paris
ought
to
contain
a
population
of
the
wisest
and
best
of
human
beings
rome
also
is
a
great
city
of
art
and
yet
there
the
virtus
or
valour
of
the
ancient
romans
has
characteristically
degenerated
into
vertu
or
a
taste
for
knicknacks
whilst
according
to
recent
accounts
the
city
itself
is
inexpressibly
foul
art
would
sometimes
even
appear
to
have
a
close
connection
with
dirt
and
it
is
said
of
ruskin
that
when
searching
for
works
of
art
in
venice
his
attendant
in
his
explorations
would
sniff
an
and
when
it
was
strong
would
say
now
we
are
coming
to
something
very
old
and
fine
meaning
in
art
a
little
common
education
in
cleanliness
where
it
is
wanting
would
probably
be
much
more
improving
as
well
as
wholesome
than
any
amount
of
education
in
fine
art
ruffles
are
all
very
well
but
it
is
folly
to
cultivate
them
to
the
neglect
of
the
shirt
whilst
therefore
grace
of
manner
politeness
of
behaviour
elegance
of
demeanour
and
all
the
arts
that
contribute
to
make
life
pleasant
and
beautiful
are
worthy
of
cultivation
it
must
not
be
at
the
expense
of
the
more
solid
and
enduring
qualities
of
honesty
sincerity
and
truthfulness
the
fountain
of
beauty
must
be
in
the
heart
more
than
in
the
eye
and
if
art
do
not
tend
to
produce
beautiful
life
and
noble
practice
it
will
be
of
comparatively
little
avail
politeness
of
manner
is
not
worth
much
unless
accompanied
by
polite
action
grace
may
be
but
very
pleasant
and
attractive
and
yet
very
heartless
art
is
a
source
of
innocent
enjoyment
and
an
important
aid
to
higher
culture
but
unless
it
leads
to
higher
culture
it
will
probably
be
merely
sensuous
and
when
art
is
merely
sensuous
it
is
enfeebling
and
demoralizing
rather
than
strengthening
or
elevating
honest
courage
is
of
greater
worth
than
any
amount
of
grace
purity
is
better
than
elegance
and
cleanliness
of
body
mind
and
heart
than
any
amount
of
fine
art
in
fine
while
the
cultivation
of
the
graces
is
not
to
be
neglected
it
should
ever
be
held
in
mind
that
there
is
something
far
higher
and
nobler
to
be
aimed
at
greater
than
pleasure
greater
than
art
greater
than
wealth
greater
than
power
greater
than
intellect
greater
than
genius
and
that
is
purity
and
excellence
of
character
without
a
solid
sterling
basis
of
individual
goodness
all
the
grace
elegance
and
art
in
the
world
would
fail
to
save
or
to
elevate

people

of
books
books
we
know
are
a
substantial
world
both
pure
and
good
round
which
with
tendrils
strong
as
flesh
and
blood
our
pastime
and
our
happiness
can
wordsworth
not
only
in
the
common
speech
of
men
but
in
all
art
too
which
is
or
should
be
the
concentrated
and
conserved
essence
of
what
men
can
speak
and
show
biography
is
almost
the
one
thing
needful
carlyle
i
read
all
biographies
with
intense
interest
even
a
man
without
a
heart
like
cavendish
i
think
about
and
read
about
and
dream
about
and
picture
to
myself
in
all
possible
ways
till
he
grows
into
a
living
being
beside
me
and
i
put
my
feet
into
his
shoes
and
become
for
the
time
cavendish
and
think
as
he
thought
and
do
as
he
did
george
wilson
my
thoughts
are
with
the
dead
with
them
i
live
in
years
their
virtues
love
their
faults
condemn
partake
their
hopes
and
fears
and
from
their
lessons
seek
and
find
instruction
with
a
humble
southey
a
man
may
usually
be
known
by
the
books
he
reads
as
well
as
by
the
company
he
keeps
for
there
is
a
companionship
of
books
as
well
as
of
men
and
one
should
always
live
in
the
best
company
whether
it
be
of
books
or
of
men
a
good
book
may
be
among
the
best
of
friends
it
is
the
same
that
it
always
was
and
it
will
never
change
it
is
the
most
patient
and
cheerful
of
companions
it
does
not
turn
its
back
upon
us
in
times
of
adversity
or
distress
it
always
receives
us
with
the
same
kindness
amusing
and
instructing
us
in
youth
and
comforting
and
consoling
us
in
age
men
often
discover
their
affinity
to
each
other
by
the
mutual
love
they
have
for
a
book
just
as
two
persons
sometimes
discover
a
friend
by
the
admiration
which
both
entertain
for
a
third
there
is
an
old
proverb
love
me
love
my
dog
but
there
is
more
wisdom
in
this
love
me
love
my
book
the
book
is
a
truer
and
higher
bond
of
union
men
can
think
feel
and
sympathise
with
each
other
through
their
favourite
author
they
live
in
him
together
and
he
in
them
books
said
hazlitt

the
poet
verse
slides
into
the
current
of
our
blood
we
read
them
when
young
we
remember
them
when
old
we
read
there
of
what
has
happened
to
others
we
feel
that
it
has
happened
to
ourselves
they
are
to
be
had
everywhere
cheap
and
good
we
breathe
but
the
air
of
books
we
owe
everything
to
their
authors
on
this
side
barbarism
a
good
book
is
often
the
best
urn
of
a
life
enshrining
the
best
thoughts
of
which
that
life
was
capable
for
the
world
of
a
man
life
is
for
the
most
part
but
the
world
of
his
thoughts
thus
the
best
books
are
treasuries
of
good
words
and
golden
thoughts
which
remembered
and
cherished
become
our
abiding
companions
and
comforters
they
are
never
alone
said
sir
philip
sidney
that
are
accompanied
by
noble
thoughts
the
good
and
true
thought
may
in
time
of
temptation
be
as
an
angel
of
mercy
purifying
and
guarding
the
soul
it
also
enshrines
the
germs
of
action
for
good
words
almost
invariably
inspire
to
good
works
thus
sir
henry
lawrence
prized
above
all
other
compositions
of
the
happy
warrior
which
he
endeavoured
to
embody
in
his
own
life
it
was
ever
before
him
as
an
exemplar
he
thought
of
it
continually
and
often
quoted
it
to
others
his
biographer
says
he
tried
to
conform
his
own
life
and
to
assimilate
his
own
character
to
it
and
he
succeeded
as
all
men
succeed
who
are
truly
in
earnest
books
possess
an
essence
of
immortality
they
are
by
far
the
most
lasting
products
of
human
effort
temples
crumble
into
ruin
pictures
and
statues
decay
but
books
survive
time
is
of
no
account
with
great
thoughts
which
are
as
fresh
as
when
they
first
passed
through
their
authors
minds
ages
ago
what
was
then
said
and
thought
still
speaks
to
us
as
vividly
as
ever
from
the
printed
page
the
only
effect
of
time
has
been
to
sift
and
winnow
out
the
bad
products
for
nothing
in
literature
can
long
survive
but
what
is
really
good
books
introduce
us
into
the
best
society
they
bring
us
into
the
presence
of
the
greatest
minds
that
have
ever
lived
we
hear
what
they
said
and
did
we
see
them
as
if
they
were
really
alive
we
are
participators
in
their
thoughts
we
sympathise
with
them
enjoy
with
them
grieve
with
them
their
experience
becomes
ours
and
we
feel
as
if
we
were
in
a
measure
actors
with
them
in
the
scenes
which
they
describe
the
great
and
good
do
not
die
even
in
this
world
embalmed
in
books
their
spirits
walk
abroad
the
book
is
a
living
voice
it
is
an
intellect
to
which
one
still
listens
hence
we
ever
remain
under
the
influence
of
the
great
men
of
old
the
dead
but
sceptred
sovrans
who
still
rule
our
spirits
from
their
urns
the
imperial
intellects
of
the
world
are
as
much
alive
now
as
they
were
ages
ago
homer
still
lives
and
though
his
personal
history
is
hidden
in
the
mists
of
antiquity
his
poems
are
as
fresh
as
if
they
had
been
newly
written
plato
still
teaches
his
transcendent
philosophy
horace
virgil
and
dante
still
sing
as
when
they
lived
shakspeare
is
not
dead
his
body
was
buried
in
but
his
mind
is
as
much
alive
in
england
now
and
his
thought
as
as
in
the
time
of
the
tudors
the
humblest
and
poorest
may
enter
the
society
of
these
great
spirits
without
being
thought
intrusive
all
who
can

have
got
the
entree

you

laugh
with
you
do
you
grieve
there
is
thomas
a
kempis
or
jeremy
taylor
to
grieve
with
and
console
you
always
it
is
to
books
and
the
spirits
of
great
men
embalmed
in
them
that
we
turn
for
entertainment
for
instruction
and
solace
in
joy
and
in

and
in
adversity
man
himself
is
of
all
things
in
the
world
the
most
interesting
to
man
whatever
relates
to
human
life
its
experiences
its
joys
its
sufferings
and
its
achievements
has
usually
attractions
for
him
beyond
all
else
each
man
is
more
or
less
interested
in
all
other
men
as
his
as
members
of
the
great
family
of
humankind
and
the
larger
a
man
culture
the
wider
is
the
range
of
his
sympathies
in
all
that
affects
the
welfare
of
his
race
men
interest
in
each
other
as
individuals
manifests
itself
in
a
thousand
ways
in
the
portraits
which
they
paint
in
the
busts
which
they
carve
in
the
narratives
which
they
relate
of
each
other
man
says
emerson
can
paint
or
make
or
think
nothing
but
man
most
of
all
is
this
interest
shown
in
the
fascination
which
personal
history
possesses
for
him
man
s
sociality
of
nature
says
carlyle
evinces
itself
in
spite
of
all
that
can
be
said
with
abundance
of
evidence
by
this
one
fact
were
there
no
other
the
unspeakable
delight
he
takes
in
biography
great
indeed
is
the
human
interest
felt
in
biography
what
are
all
the
novels
that
find
such
multitudes
of
readers
but
so
many
fictitious
biographies
what
are
the
dramas
that
people
crowd
to
see
but
so
much
acted
biography
strange
that
the
highest
genius
should
be
employed
on
the
fictitious
biography
and
so
much
commonplace
ability
on
the
real
yet
the
authentic
picture
of
any
human
being
life
and
experience
ought
to
possess
an
interest
greatly
beyond
that
which
is
fictitious
inasmuch
as
it
has
the
charm
of
reality
every
person
may
learn
something
from
the
recorded
life
of
another
and
even
comparatively
trivial
deeds
and
sayings
may
be
invested
with
interest
as
being
the
outcome
of
the
lives
of
such
beings
as
we
ourselves
are
the
records
of
the
lives
of
good
men
are
especially
useful
they
influence
our
hearts
inspire
us
with
hope
and
set
before
us
great
examples
and
when
men
have
done
their
duty
through
life
in
a
great
spirit
their
influence
will
never
wholly
pass
away
the
good
life
says
george
herbert
is
never
out
of
season
goethe
has
said
that
there
is
no
man
so
commonplace
that
a
wise
man
may
not
learn
something
from
him
sir
walter
scott
could
not
travel
in
a
coach
without
gleaning
some
information
or
discovering
some
new
trait
of
character
in
his
companions
johnson
once
observed
that
there
was
not
a
person
in
the
streets
but
he
should
like
to
know
his
biography
his
experiences
of
life
his
trials
his
difficulties
his
successes
and
his
failures
how
much
more
truly
might
this
be
said
of
the
men
who
have
made
their
mark
in
the
world
history
and
have
created
for
us
that
great
inheritance
of
civilization
of
which
we
are
the
possessors
whatever
relates
to
such
men
to
their
habits
their
manners
their
modes
of
living
their
personal
history
their
conversation
their
maxims
their
virtues
or
their
greatness
is
always
full
of
interest
of
instruction
of
encouragement
and
of
example
the
great
lesson
of
biography
is
to
show
what
man
can
be
and
do
at
his
best
a
noble
life
put
fairly
on
record
acts
like
an
inspiration
to
others
it
exhibits
what
life
is
capable
of
being
made
it
refreshes
our
spirit
encourages
our
hopes
gives
us
new
strength
and
courage
and
faith
faith
in
others
as
well
as
in
ourselves
it
stimulates
our
aspirations
rouses
us
to
action
and
incites
us
to
become
with
them
in
their
work
to
live
with
such
men
in
their
biographies
and
to
be
inspired
by
their
example
is
to
live
with
the
best
of
men
and
to
mix
in
the
best
of
company
at
the
head
of
all
biographies
stands
the
great
biography
the
book
of
books
and
what
is
the
bible
the
most
sacred
and
impressive
of
all
books
the
educator
of
youth
the
guide
of
manhood
and
the
consoler
of
age
but
a
series
of
biographies
of
great
heroes
and
patriarchs
prophets
kings
and
judges
culminating
in
the
greatest
biography
of
all
the
life
embodied
in
the
new
testament
how
much
have
the
great
examples
there
set
forth
done
for
mankind
how
many
have
drawn
from
them
their
truest
strength
their
highest
wisdom
their
best
nurture
and
admonition
truly
does
a
great
roman
catholic
writer
describe
the
bible
as
a
book
whose
words
live
in
the
ear
like
a
music
that
can
never
be
forgotten
like
the
sound
of
church
bells
which
the
convert
hardly
knows
how
he
can
forego
its
felicities
often
seem
to
be
almost
things
rather
than
mere
words
it
is
part
of
the
national
mind
and
the
anchor
of
national
seriousness
the
memory
of
the
dead
passes
into
it
the
potent
traditions
of
childhood
are
stereotyped
in
its
verses
the
power
of
all
the
griefs
and
trials
of
man
is
hidden
beneath
its
words
it
is
the
representative
of
his
best
moments
and
all
that
has
been
about
him
of
soft
and
gentle
and
pure
and
penitent
and
good
speaks
to
him
for
ever
out
of
his
english
bible
it
is
his
sacred
thing
which
doubt
has
never
dimmed
and
controversy
never
soiled
in
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
there
is
not
a
protestant
with
one
spark
of
religiousness
about
him
whose
spiritual
biography
is
not
in
his
saxon
bible
it
would
indeed
be
difficult
to
overestimate
the
influence
which
the
lives
of
the
great
and
good
have
exercised
upon
the
elevation
of
human
character
the
best
biography
says
isaac
disraeli
is
a
reunion
with
human
existence
in
its
most
excellent
state
indeed
it
is
impossible
for
one
to
read
the
lives
of
good
men
much
less
inspired
men
without
being
unconsciously
lighted
and
lifted
up
in
them
and
growing
insensibly
nearer
to
what
they
thought
and
did
and
even
the
lives
of
humbler
persons
of
men
of
faithful
and
honest
spirit
who
have
done
their
duty
in
life
well
are
not
without
an
elevating
influence
upon
the
character
of
those
who
come
after
them
history
itself
is
best
studied
in
biography
indeed
history
is
biography
collective
humanity
as
influenced
and
governed
by
individual
men
what
is
all
history
says
emerson
but
the
work
of
ideas
a
record
of
the
incomparable
energy
which
his
infinite
aspirations
infuse
into
man
in
its
pages
it
is
always
persons
we
see
more
than
principles
historical
events
are
interesting
to
us
mainly
in
connection
with
the
feelings
the
sufferings
and
interests
of
those
by
whom
they
are
accomplished
in
history
we
are
surrounded
by
men
long
dead
but
whose
speech
and
whose
deeds
survive
we
almost
catch
the
sound
of
their
voices
and
what
they
did
constitutes
the
interest
of
history
we
never
feel
personally
interested
in
masses
of
men
but
we
feel
and
sympathise
with
the
individual
actors
whose
biographies
afford
the
finest
and
most
real
touches
in
all
great
historical
dramas
among
the
great
writers
of
the
past
probably
the
two
that
have
been
most
influential
in
forming
the
characters
of
great
men
of
action
and
great
men
of
thought
have
been
plutarch
and
montaigne
the
one
by
presenting
heroic
models
for
imitation
the
other
by
probing
questions
of
constant
recurrence
in
which
the
human
mind
in
all
ages
has
taken
the
deepest
interest
and
the
works
of
both
are
for
the
most
part
cast
in
a
biographic
form
their
most
striking
illustrations
consisting
in
the
exhibitions
of
character
and
experience
which
they
contain
plutarch
though
written
nearly
eighteen
hundred
years
ago
like
homer
still
holds
its
ground
as
the
greatest
work
of
its
kind
it
was
the
favourite
book
of
montaigne
and
to
englishmen
it
possesses
the
special
interest
of
having
been
shakspeare
principal
authority
in
his
great
classical
dramas
montaigne
pronounced
plutarch
to
be
the
greatest
master
in
that
kind
of
writing
the
biographic
and
he
declared
that
he
could
no
sooner
cast
an
eye
upon
him
but
he
purloined
either
a
leg
or
a
wing
alfieri
was
first
drawn
with
passion
to
literature
by
reading
plutarch
i
read
said
he
the
lives
of
timoleon
caesar
brutus
pelopidas
more
than
six
times
with
cries
with
tears
and
with
such
transports
that
i
was
almost
furious
every
time
that
i
met
with
one
of
the
grand
traits
of
these
great
men
i
was
seized
with
such
vehement
agitation
as
to
be
unable
to
sit
still
plutarch
was
also
a
favourite
with
persons
of
such
various
minds
as
schiller
and
benjamin
franklin
napoleon
and
madame
roland
the
latter
was
so
fascinated
by
the
book
that
she
carried
it
to
church
with
her
in
the
guise
of
a
missal
and
read
it
surreptitiously
during
the
service
it
has
also
been
the
nurture
of
heroic
souls
such
as
henry
iv
of
france
turenne
and
the
napiers
it
was
one
of
sir
william
favourite
books
when
a
boy
his
mind
was
early
imbued
by
it
with
a
passionate
admiration
for
the
great
heroes
of
antiquity
and
its
influence
had
doubtless
much
to
do
with
the
formation
of
his
character
as
well
as
the
direction
of
his
career
in
life
it
is
related
of
him
that
in
his
last
illness
when
feeble
and
exhausted
his
mind
wandered
back
to
plutarch
heroes
and
he
descanted
for
hours
to
his
on
the
mighty
deeds
of
alexander
hannibal
and
caesar
indeed
if
it
were
possible
to
poll
the
great
body
of
readers
in
all
ages
whose
minds
have
been
influenced
and
directed
by
books
it
is
probable
that
excepting
always
the
bible
the
immense
majority
of
votes
would
be
cast
in
favour
of
plutarch
and
how
is
it
that
plutarch
has
succeeded
in
exciting
an
interest
which
continues
to
attract
and
rivet
the
attention
of
readers
of
all
ages
and
classes
to
this
day
in
the
first
place
because
the
subject
of
his
work
is
great
men
who
occupied
a
prominent
place
in
the
world
history
and
because
he
had
an
eye
to
see
and
a
pen
to
describe
the
more
prominent
events
and
circumstances
in
their
lives
and
not
only
so
but
he
possessed
the
power
of
portraying
the
individual
character
of
his
heroes
for
it
is
the
principle
of
individuality
which
gives
the
charm
and
interest
to
all
biography
the
most
engaging
side
of
great
men
is
not
so
much
what
they
do
as
what
they
are
and
does
not
depend
upon
their
power
of
intellect
but
on
their
personal
attractiveness
thus
there
are
men
whose
lives
are
far
more
eloquent
than
their
speeches
and
whose
personal
character
is
far
greater
than
their
deeds
it
is
also
to
be
observed
that
while
the
best
and
most
of
plutarch
portraits
are
of
many
of
them
are
little
more
than
busts
they
are
but
compact
and
within
such
reasonable
compass
that
the
best
of
them
such
as
the
lives
of
caesar
and
alexander
may
be
read
in
half
an
hour
reduced
to
this
measure
they
are
however
greatly
more
imposing
than
a
lifeless
colossus
or
an
exaggerated
giant
they
are
not
overlaid
by
disquisition
and
description
but
the
characters
naturally
unfold
themselves
montaigne
indeed
complained
of
plutarch
brevity
no
doubt
he
added
but
his
reputation
is
the
better
for
it
though
in
the
meantime
we
are
the
worse
plutarch
would
rather
we
should
applaud
his
judgment
than
commend
his
knowledge
and
had
rather
leave
us
with
an
appetite
to
read
more
than
glutted
with
what
we
have
already
read
he
knew
very
well
that
a
man
may
say
too
much
even
on
the
best
subjects
such
as
have
lean
and
spare
bodies
stuff
themselves
out
with
clothes
so
they
who
are
defective
in
matter
endeavour
to
make
amends
with
words
plutarch
possessed
the
art
of
delineating
the
more
delicate
features
of
mind
and
minute
peculiarities
of
conduct
as
well
as
the
foibles
and
defects
of
his
heroes
all
of
which
is
necessary
to
faithful
and
accurate
portraiture
to
see
him
says
montaigne
pick
out
a
light
action
in
a
man
life
or
a
word
that
does
not
seem
to
be
of
any
importance
is
itself
a
whole
discourse
he
even
condescends
to
inform
us
of
such
homely
particulars
as
that
alexander
carried
his
head
affectedly
on
one
side
that
alcibiades
was
a
dandy
and
had
a
lisp
which
became
him
giving
a
grace
and
persuasive
turn
to
his
discourse
that
cato
had
red
hair
and
gray
eyes
and
was
a
usurer
and
a
screw
selling
off
his
old
slaves
when
they
became
unfit
for
hard
work
that
caesar
was
bald
and
fond
of
gay
dress
and
that
cicero
lord
brougham
had
involuntary
twitchings
of
his
nose
such
minute
particulars
may
by
some
be
thought
beneath
the
dignity
of
biography
but
plutarch
thought
them
requisite
for
the
due
finish
of
the
complete
portrait
which
he
set
himself
to
draw
and
it
is
by
small
details
of
character
personal
traits
features
habits
and
characteristics
that
we
are
enabled
to
see
before
us
the
men
as
they
really
lived
plutarch
great
merit
consists
in
his
attention
to
these
little
things
without
giving
them
undue
preponderance
or
neglecting
those
which
are
of
greater
moment
sometimes
he
hits
off
an
individual
trait
by
an
anecdote
which
throws
more
light
upon
the
character
described
than
pages
of
rhetorical
description
would
do
in
some
cases
he
gives
us
the
favourite
maxim
of
his
hero
and
the
maxims
of
men
often
reveal
their
hearts
then
as
to
foibles
the
greatest
of
men
are
not
visually
symmetrical
each
has
his
defect
his
twist
his
craze
and
it
is
by
his
faults
that
the
great
man
reveals
his
common
humanity
we
may
at
a
distance
admire
him
as
a
demigod
but
as
we
come
nearer
to
him
we
find
that
he
is
but
a
fallible
man
and
our
brother
nor
are
the
illustrations
of
the
defects
of
great
men
without
their
uses
for
as
johnson
observed
if
nothing
but
the
bright
side
of
characters
were
shown
we
should
sit
down
in
despondency
and
think
it
utterly
impossible
to
imitate
them
in
anything
plutarch
himself
justifies
his
method
of
portraiture
by
averring
that
his
design
was
not
to
write
histories
but
lives
the
most
glorious
exploits
he
says
do
not
always
furnish
us
with
the
clearest
discoveries
of
virtue
or
of
vice
in
men
sometimes
a
matter
of
much
less
moment
an
expression
or
a
jest
better
informs
us
of
their
characters
and
inclinations
than
battles
with
the
slaughter
of
tens
of
thousands
and
the
greatest
arrays
of
armies
or
sieges
of
cities
therefore
as
are
more
exact
in
their
lines
and
features
of
the
face
and
the
expression
of
the
eyes
in
which
the
character
is
seen
without
troubling
themselves
about
the
other
parts
of
the
body
so
i
must
be
allowed
to
give
my
more
particular
attention
to
the
signs
and
indications
of
the
souls
of
men
and
while
i
endeavour
by
these
means
to
portray
their
lives
i
leave
important
events
and
great
battles
to
be
described
by
others
things
apparently
trifling
may
stand
for
much
in
biography
as
well
as
history
and
slight
circumstances
may
influence
great
results
pascal
has
remarked
that
if
cleopatra
nose
had
been
shorter
the
whole
face
of
the
world
would
probably
have
been
changed
but
for
the
amours
of
pepin
the
fat
the
saracens
might
have
overrun
europe
as
it
was
his
illegitimate
son
charles
martel
who
overthrew
them
at
tours
and
eventually
drove
them
out
of
france
that
sir
walter
scott
should
have
sprained
his
foot
in
running
round
the
room
when
a
child
may
seem
unworthy
of
notice
in
his
biography
yet
mortality
and
all
the
waverley
novels
depended
upon
it
when
his
son
intimated
a
desire
to
enter
the
army
scott
wrote
to
southey
i
have
no
title
to
combat
a
choice
which
would
have
been
my
own
had
not
my
lameness
prevented
so
that
had
not
scott
been
lame
he
might
have
fought
all
through
the
peninsular
war
and
had
his
breast
covered
with
medals
but
we
should
probably
have
had
none
of
those
works
of
his
which
have
made
his
name
immortal
and
shed
so
much
glory
upon
his
country
talleyrand
also
was
kept
out
of
the
army
for
which
he
had
been
destined
by
his
lameness
but
directing
his
attention
to
the
study
of
books
and
eventually
of
men
he
at
length
took
rank
amongst
the
greatest
diplomatists
of
his
time
byron
clubfoot
had
probably
not
a
little
to
do
with
determining
his
destiny
as
a
poet
had
not
his
mind
been
embittered
and
made
morbid
by
his
deformity
he
might
never
have
written
a
line
he
might
have
been
the
noblest
fop
of
his
day
but
his
misshapen
foot
stimulated
his
mind
roused
his
ardour
threw
him
upon
his
own
resources
and
we
know
with
what
result
so
too
of
scarron
to
whose
hunchback
we
probably
owe
his
cynical
verse
and
of
pope
whose
satire
was
in
a
measure
the
outcome
of
his
deformity
for
he
was
as
johnson
described
him
protuberant
behind
and
before
what
lord
bacon
said
of
deformity
is
doubtless
to
a
great
extent
true
whoever
said
he
hath
anything
fixed
in
his
person
that
doth
induce
contempt
hath
also
a
perpetual
spur
in
himself
to
rescue
and
deliver
himself
from
scorn
therefore
all
deformed
persons
are
extremely
bold
as
in
portraiture
so
in
biography
there
must
be
light
and
shade
the
does
not
pose
his
sitter
so
as
to
bring
out
his
deformities
nor
does
the
biographer
give
undue
prominence
to
the
defects
of
the
character
he
portrays
not
many
men
are
so
outspoken
as
cromwell
was
when
he
sat
to
cooper
for
his
miniature
paint
me
as
i
am
said
he
warts
and
all
yet
if
we
would
have
a
faithful
likeness
of
faces
and
characters
they
must
be
painted
as
they
are
biography
said
sir
walter
scott
the
most
interesting
of
every
species
of
composition
loses
all
its
interest
with
me
when
the
shades
and
lights
of
the
principal
characters
are
not
accurately
and
faithfully
detailed
i
can
no
more
sympathise
with
a
mere
eulogist
than
i
can
with
a
ranting
hero
on
the
stage
addison
liked
to
know
as
much
as
possible
about
the
person
and
character
of
his
authors
inasmuch
as
it
increased
the
pleasure
and
satisfaction
which
he
derived
from
the
perusal
of
their
books
what
was
their
history
their
experience
their
temper
and
disposition
did
their
lives
resemble
their
books
they
thought
nobly
did
they
act
nobly
should
we
not
delight
says
sir
egerton
brydges
to
have
the
frank
story
of
the
lives
and
feelings
of
wordsworth
southey
coleridge
campbell
rogers
moore
and
wilson
related
by
themselves
with
whom
they
lived
early
how
their
bent
took
a
decided
course
their
likes
and
dislikes
their
difficulties
and
obstacles
their
tastes
their
passions
the
rocks
they
were
conscious
of
having
split
upon
their
regrets
their
complacencies
and
their
when
mason
was
reproached
for
publishing
the
private
letters
of
gray
he
answered
would
you
always
have
my
friends
appear
in
johnson
was
of
opinion
that
to
write
a
man
life
truly
it
is
necessary
that
the
biographer
should
have
personally
known
him
but
this
condition
has
been
wanting
in
some
of
the
best
writers
of
biographies
extant
in
the
case
of
lord
campbell
his
personal
intimacy
with
lords
lyndhurst
and
brougham
seems
to
have
been
a
positive
disadvantage
leading
him
to
dwarf
the
excellences
and
to
magnify
the
blots
in
their
characters
again
johnson
says
if
a
man
profess
to
write
a
life
he
must
write
it
really
as
it
was
a
man
peculiarities
and
even
his
vices
should
be
mentioned
because
they
mark
his
character
but
there
is
always
this
difficulty
that
while
minute
details
of
conduct
favourable
or
otherwise
can
best
be
given
from
personal
knowledge
they
can
not
always
be
published
out
of
regard
for
the
living
and
when
the
time
arrives
when
they
may
at
length
be
told
they
are
then
no
longer
remembered
johnson
himself
expressed
this
reluctance
to
tell
all
he
knew
of
those
poets
who
had
been
his
contemporaries
saying
that
he
felt
as
if
walking
upon
ashes
under
which
the
fire
was
not
extinguished
for
this
reason
amongst
others
we
rarely
obtain
an
unvarnished
picture
of
character
from
the
near
relatives
of
distinguished
men
and
interesting
though
all
autobiography
is
still
less
can
we
expect
it
from
the
men
themselves
in
writing
his
own
memoirs
a
man
will
not
tell
all
that
he
knows
about
himself
augustine
was
a
rare
exception
but
few
there
are
who
will
as
he
did
in
his
lay
bare
their
innate
viciousness
deceitfulness
and
selfishness
there
is
a
highland
proverb
which
says
that
if
the
best
man
faults
were
written
on
his
forehead
he
would
pull
his
bonnet
over
his
brow
there
is
no
man
said
voltaire
who
has
not
something
hateful
in
him
no
man
who
has
not
some
of
the
wild
beast
in
him
but
there
are
few
who
will
honestly
tell
us
how
they
manage
their
wild
beast
rousseau
pretended
to
unbosom
himself
in
his
but
it
is
manifest
that
he
held
back
far
more
than
he
revealed
even
chamfort
one
of
the
last
men
to
fear
what
his
contemporaries
might
think
or
say
of
him
once
observed
it
seems
to
me
impossible
in
the
actual
state
of
society
for
any
man
to
exhibit
his
secret
heart
the
details
of
his
character
as
known
to
himself
and
above
all
his
weaknesses
and
his
vices
to
even
his
best
friend
an
autobiography
may
be
true
so
far
as
it
goes
but
in
communicating
only
part
of
the
truth
it
may
convey
an
impression
that
is
really
false
it
may
be
a
disguise
sometimes
it
is
an
apology
exhibiting
not
so
much
what
a
man
really
was
as
what
he
would
have
liked
to
be
a
portrait
in
profile
may
be
correct
but
who
knows
whether
some
scar
on
the
or
some
squint
in
the
eye
that
is
not
seen
might
not
have
entirely
altered
the
expression
of
the
face
if
brought
into
sight
scott
moore
southey
all
began
autobiographies
but
the
task
of
continuing
them
was
doubtless
felt
to
be
too
difficult
as
well
as
delicate
and
they
were
abandoned
french
literature
is
especially
rich
in
a
class
of
biographic
memoirs
of
which
we
have
few
counterparts
in
english
we
refer
to
their
memoires
pour
servir
such
as
those
of
sully
de
comines
lauzun
de
retz
de
thou
rochefoucalt
in
which
we
have
recorded
an
immense
mass
of
minute
and
circumstantial
information
relative
to
many
great
personages
of
history
they
are
full
of
anecdotes
illustrative
of
life
and
character
and
of
details
which
might
be
called
frivolous
but
that
they
throw
a
flood
of
light
on
the
social
habits
and
general
civilisation
of
the
periods
to
which
they
relate
the
memoires
of
are
something
more
they
are
marvellous
dissections
of
character
and
constitute
the
most
extraordinary
collection
of
anatomical
biography
that
has
ever
been
brought
together
might
almost
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
posthumous
of
louis
the
fourteenth
he
was
possessed
by
a
passion
for
reading
character
and
endeavouring
to
decipher
motives
and
intentions
in
the
faces
expressions
conversation
and
byplay
of
those
about
him
i
examine
all
my
personages
closely
said
he
watch
their
mouth
eyes
and
ears
constantly
and
what
he
heard
and
saw
he
noted
down
with
extraordinary
vividness
and
dash
acute
keen
and
observant
he
pierced
the
masks
of
the
courtiers
and
detected
their
secrets
the
ardour
with
which
he
prosecuted
his
favourite
study
of
character
seemed
insatiable
and
even
cruel
the
eager
anatomist
says
was
not
more
ready
to
plunge
the
scalpel
into
the
bosom
in
search
of
the
disease
that
had
baffled
him
la
bruyere
possessed
the
same
gift
of
accurate
and
penetrating
observation
of
character
he
watched
and
studied
everybody
about
him
he
sought
to
read
their
secrets
and
retiring
to
his
chamber
he
deliberately
painted
their
portraits
returning
to
them
from
time
to
time
to
correct
some
prominent
feature
hanging
over
them
as
fondly
as
an
artist
over
some
favourite
study
adding
trait
to
trait
and
touch
to
touch
until
at
length
the
picture
was
complete
and
the
likeness
perfect
it
may
be
said
that
much
of
the
interest
of
biography
especially
of
the
more
familiar
sort
is
of
the
nature
of
gossip
as
that
of
the
memoires
pour
servir
is
of
the
nature
of
scandal
which
is
no
doubt
true
but
both
gossip
and
scandal
illustrate
the
strength
of
the
interest
which
men
and
women
take
in
each
other
personality
and
which
exhibited
in
the
form
of
biography
is
capable
of
communicating
the
highest
pleasure
and
yielding
the
best
instruction
indeed
biography
because
it
is
instinct
of
humanity
is
the
branch
of
literature
which
whether
in
the
form
of
fiction
of
anecdotal
recollection
or
of
personal
narrative
is
the
one
that
invariably
commends
itself
to
by
far
the
largest
class
of
readers
there
is
no
room
for
doubt
that
the
surpassing
interest
which
fiction
whether
in
poetry
or
prose
possesses
for
most
minds
arises
mainly
from
the
biographic
element
which
it
contains
homer
owes
its
marvellous
popularity
to
the
genius
which
its
author
displayed
in
the
portrayal
of
heroic
character
yet
he
does
not
so
much
describe
his
personages
in
detail
as
make
them
develope
themselves
by
their
actions
there
are
in
homer
said
johnson
such
characters
of
heroes
and
combination
of
qualities
of
heroes
that
the
united
powers
of
mankind
ever
since
have
not
produced
any
but
what
are
to
be
found
there
the
genius
of
shakspeare
also
was
displayed
in
the
powerful
delineation
of
character
and
the
dramatic
evolution
of
human
passions
his
personages
seem
to
be
real
living
and
breathing
before
us
so
too
with
cervantes
whose
sancho
panza
though
homely
and
vulgar
is
intensely
human
the
characters
in
le
sage
blas
in
goldsmith
of
wakefield
and
in
scott
marvellous
seem
to
us
almost
as
real
as
persons
whom
we
have
actually
known
and
de
foe
greatest
works
are
but
so
many
biographies
painted
in
minute
detail
with
reality
so
apparently
stamped
upon
every
page
that
it
is
difficult
to
believe
his
robinson
crusoe
and
colonel
jack
to
have
been
fictitious
instead
of
real
persons
though
the
richest
romance
lies
enclosed
in
actual
human
life
and
though
biography
because
it
describes
beings
who
have
actually
felt
the
joys
and
sorrows
and
experienced
the
difficulties
and
triumphs
of
real
life
is
capable
of
being
made
more
attractive
than
the
most
perfect
fictions
ever
woven
it
is
remarkable
that
so
few
men
of
genius
have
been
attracted
to
the
composition
of
works
of
this
kind
great
works
of
fiction
abound
but
great
biographies
may
be
counted
on
the
fingers
it
may
be
for
the
same
reason
that
a
great
painter
of
portraits
the
late
john
philip
explained
his
preference
for
because
said
he
does
not
pay
biographic
portraiture
involves
laborious
investigation
and
careful
collection
of
facts
judicious
rejection
and
skilful
condensation
as
well
as
the
art
of
presenting
the
character
portrayed
in
the
most
attractive
and
lifelike
form
whereas
in
the
work
of
fiction
the
writer
imagination
is
free
to
create
and
to
portray
character
without
being
trammelled
by
references
or
held
down
by
the
actual
details
of
real
life
there
is
indeed
no
want
among
us
of
ponderous
but
lifeless
memoirs
many
of
them
little
better
than
inventories
put
together
with
the
help
of
the
scissors
as
much
as
of
the
pen
what
constable
said
of
the
portraits
of
an
inferior
artist
he
takes
all
the
bones
and
brains
out
of
his
heads
applies
to
a
large
class
of
portraiture
written
as
well
as
painted
they
have
no
more
life
in
them
than
a
piece
of
waxwork
or
a
at
a
tailor
door
what
we
want
is
a
picture
of
a
man
as
he
lived
and
lo
we
have
an
exhibition
of
the
biographer
himself
we
expect
an
embalmed
heart
and
we
find
only
clothes
there
is
doubtless
as
high
art
displayed
in
painting
a
portrait
in
words
as
there
is
in
painting
one
in
colours
to
do
either
well
requires
the
seeing
eye
and
the
skilful
pen
or
brush
a
common
artist
sees
only
the
features
of
a
face
and
copies
them
but
the
great
artist
sees
the
living
soul
shining
through
the
features
and
places
it
on
the
canvas
johnson
was
once
asked
to
assist
the
chaplain
of
a
deceased
bishop
in
writing
a
memoir
of
his
lordship
but
when
he
proceeded
to
inquire
for
information
the
chaplain
could
scarcely
tell
him
anything
hence
johnson
was
led
to
observe
that
few
people
who
have
lived
with
a
man
know
what
to
remark
about
him
in
the
case
of
johnson
own
life
it
was
the
seeing
eye
of
boswell
that
enabled
him
to
note
and
treasure
up
those
minute
details
of
habit
and
conversation
in
which
so
much
of
the
interest
of
biography
consists
boswell
because
of
his
simple
love
and
admiration
of
his
hero
succeeded
where
probably
greater
men
would
have
failed
he
descended
to
apparently
insignificant
but
yet
most
characteristic
particulars
thus
he
apologizes
for
informing
the
reader
that
johnson
when
journeying
carried
in
his
hand
a
large
english
adding
i
remember
adam
smith
in
his
rhetorical
lectures
at
glasgow
told
us
he
was
glad
to
know
that
milton
wore
latchets
in
his
shoes
instead
of
buckles
boswell
lets
us
know
how
johnson
looked
what
dress
he
wore
what
was
his
talk
what
were
his
prejudices
he
painted
him
with
all
his
scars
and
a
wonderful
portrait
it
is
perhaps
the
most
complete
picture
of
a
great
man
ever
limned
in
words
but
for
the
accident
of
the
scotch
advocate
intimacy
with
johnson
and
his
devoted
admiration
of
him
the
latter
would
not
probably
have
stood
nearly
so
high
in
literature
as
he
now
does
it
is
in
the
pages
of
boswell
that
johnson
really
lives
and
but
for
boswell
he
might
have
remained
little
more
than
a
name
others
there
are
who
have
bequeathed
great
works
to
posterity
but
of
whose
lives
next
to
nothing
is
known
what
would
we
not
give
to
have
a
boswell
account
of
shakspeare
we
positively
know
more
of
the
personal
history
of
socrates
of
horace
of
cicero
of
augustine
than
we
do
of
that
of
shakspeare
we
do
not
know
what
was
his
religion
what
were
his
politics
what
were
his
experiences
what
were
his
relations
to
his
contemporaries
the
men
of
his
own
time
do
not
seem
to
have
recognised
his
greatness
and
ben
jonson
the
court
poet
whose
shakspeare
was
content
to
commit
to
memory
and
recite
as
an
actor
stood
higher
in
popular
estimation
we
only
know
that
he
was
a
successful
theatrical
manager
and
that
in
the
prime
of
life
he
retired
to
his
native
place
where
he
died
and
had
the
honours
of
a
village
funeral
the
greater
part
of
the
biography
which
has
been
constructed
respecting
him
has
been
the
result
not
of
contemporary
observation
or
of
record
but
of
inference
the
best
inner
biography
of
the
man
is
to
be
found
in
his
sonnets
men
do
not
always
take
an
accurate
measure
of
their
contemporaries
the
statesman
the
general
the
monarch
of
fills
all
eyes
and
ears
though
to
the
next
generation
he
may
be
as
if
he
had
never
been
and
who
is
king
the
painter
greuze
would
ask
of
his
daughter
during
the
throes
of
the
first
french
revolution
when
men
great
for
the
time
were
suddenly
thrown
to
the
surface
and
as
suddenly
dropt
out
of
sight
again
never
to
reappear
and
who
is
king
after
all
greuze
would
add
citizen
homer
and
citizen
raphael
will
outlive
those
great
citizens
of
ours
whose
names
i
have
never
before
heard
of
yet
of
the
personal
history
of
homer
nothing
is
known
and
of
raphael
comparatively
little
even
plutarch
who
wrote
the
lives
of
others
so
well
has
no
biography
none
of
the
eminent
roman
writers
who
were
his
contemporaries
having
so
much
as
mentioned
his
name
and
so
of
correggio
who
delineated
the
features
of
others
so
well
there
is
not
known
to
exist
an
authentic
portrait
there
have
been
men
who
greatly
influenced
the
life
of
their
time
whose
reputation
has
been
much
greater
with
posterity
than
it
was
with
their
contemporaries
of
wickliffe
the
patriarch
of
the
reformation
our
knowledge
is
extremely
small
he
was
but
as
a
voice
crying
in
the
wilderness
we
do
not
really
know
who
was
the
author
of
imitation
of
christ
a
book
that
has
had
an
immense
circulation
and
exercised
a
vast
religious
influence
in
all
christian
countries
it
is
usually
attributed
to
thomas
a
kempis
but
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
he
was
merely
its
translator
and
the
book
that
is
really
known
to
be
his
is
in
all
respects
so
inferior
that
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
imitation
proceeded
from
the
same
pen
it
is
considered
more
probable
that
the
real
author
was
john
gerson
chancellor
of
the
university
of
paris
a
most
learned
and
devout
man
who
died
in
some
of
the
greatest
men
of
genius
have
had
the
shortest
biographies
of
plato
one
of
the
great
fathers
of
moral
philosophy
we
have
no
personal
account
if
he
had
wife
and
children
we
hear
nothing
of
them
about
the
life
of
aristotle
there
is
the
greatest
diversity
of
opinion
one
says
he
was
a
jew
another
that
he
only
got
his
information
from
a
jew
one
says
he
kept
an
apothecary
shop
another
that
he
was
only
the
son
of
a
physician
one
alleges
that
he
was
an
atheist
another
that
he
was
a
trinitarian
and
so
forth
but
we
know
almost
as
little
with
respect
to
many
men
of
comparatively
modern
times
thus
how
little
do
we
know
of
the
lives
of
spenser
author
of
faerie
queen
and
of
butler
the
author
of
beyond
the
fact
that
they
lived
in
comparative
obscurity
and
died
in
extreme
poverty
how
little
comparatively
do
we
know
of
the
life
of
jeremy
taylor
the
golden
preacher
of
whom
we
should
like
to
have
known
so
much
the
author
of
van
artevelde
has
said
that
the
world
knows
nothing
of
its
greatest
men
and
doubtless
oblivion
has
enwrapt
in
its
folds
many
great
men
who
have
done
great
deeds
and
been
forgotten
augustine
speaks
of
romanianus
as
the
greatest
genius
that
ever
lived
and
yet
we
know
nothing
of
him
but
his
name
he
is
as
much
forgotten
as
the
builders
of
the
pyramids
gordiani
epitaph
was
written
in
five
languages
yet
it
sufficed
not
to
rescue
him
from
oblivion
many
indeed
are
the
lives
worthy
of
record
that
have
remained
unwritten
men
who
have
written
books
have
been
the
most
fortunate
in
this
respect
because
they
possess
an
attraction
for
literary
men
which
those
whose
lives
have
been
embodied
in
deeds
do
not
possess
thus
there
have
been
lives
written
of
poets
laureate
who
were
mere
men
of
their
time
and
of
their
time
only
johnson
includes
some
of
them
in
his
of
the
poets
such
as
edmund
smith
and
others
whose
poems
are
now
no
longer
known
the
lives
of
some
men
of
letters
such
as
goldsmith
swift
sterne
and
steele
have
been
written
again
and
again
whilst
great
men
of
action
men
of
science
and
men
of
industry
are
left
without
a
record
we
have
said
that
a
man
may
be
known
by
the
company
he
keeps
in
his
books
let
us
mention
a
few
of
the
favourites
of
the
men
plutarch
admirers
have
already
been
referred
to
montaigne
also
has
been
the
companion
of
most
meditative
men
although
shakspeare
must
have
studied
plutarch
carefully
inasmuch
as
he
copied
from
him
freely
even
to
his
very
words
it
is
remarkable
that
montaigne
is
the
only
book
which
we
certainly
know
to
have
been
in
the
poet
library
one
of
shakspeare
existing
autographs
having
been
found
in
a
copy
of
translation
of
essays
which
also
contains
on
the
flyleaf
the
autograph
of
ben
jonson
milton
favourite
books
were
homer
ovid
and
euripides
the
latter
book
was
also
the
favourite
of
charles
james
fox
who
regarded
the
study
of
it
as
especially
useful
to
a
public
speaker
on
the
other
hand
pitt
took
especial
delight
in
milton
whom
fox
did
not
appreciate
taking
pleasure
in
reciting
from
lost
the
grand
speech
of
belial
before
the
assembled
powers
of
pandemonium
another
of
pitt
favourite
books
was
newton
again
the
earl
of
chatham
favourite
book
was
sermons
which
he
read
so
often
as
to
be
able
to
repeat
them
from
memory
while
burke
companions
were
demosthenes
milton
bolingbroke
and
young
thoughts
curran
favourite
was
homer
which
he
read
through
once
a
year
virgil
was
another
of
his
favourites
his
biographer
phillips
saying
that
he
once
saw
him
reading
the
in
the
cabin
of
a
holyhead
packet
while
every
one
about
him
was
prostrate
by
seasickness
of
the
poets
dante
favourite
was
virgil
corneille
was
lucan
schiller
was
shakspeare
gray
was
spenser
whilst
coleridge
admired
collins
and
bowles
dante
himself
was
a
favourite
with
most
great
poets
from
chaucer
to
byron
and
tennyson
lord
brougham
macaulay
and
carlyle
have
alike
admired
and
eulogized
the
great
italian
the
former
advised
the
students
at
glasgow
that
next
to
demosthenes
the
study
of
dante
was
the
best
preparative
for
the
eloquence
of
the
pulpit
or
the
bar
robert
hall
sought
relief
in
dante
from
the
racking
pains
of
spinal
disease
and
sydney
smith
took
to
the
same
poet
for
comfort
and
solace
in
his
old
age
it
was
characteristic
of
goethe
that
his
favourite
book
should
have
been
spinoza
in
which
he
said
he
had
found
a
peace
and
consolation
such
as
he
had
been
able
to
find
in
no
other
work
barrow
favourite
was
chrysostom
bossuet
was
homer
was
the
old
legend
of
sir
bevis
of
southampton
which
in
all
probability
gave
him
the
first
idea
of
his
progress
one
of
the
best
prelates
that
ever
sat
on
the
english
bench
john
sharp
said
shakspeare
and
the
bible
have
made
me
archbishop
of
york
the
two
books
which
most
impressed
john
wesley
when
a
young
man
were
imitation
of
christ
and
jeremy
taylor
living
and
dying
yet
wesley
was
accustomed
to
caution
his
young
friends
against
overmuch
reading
beware
you
be
not
swallowed
up
in
books
he
would
say
to
them
an
ounce
of
love
is
worth
a
pound
of
knowledge
wesley
own
life
has
been
a
great
favourite
with
many
thoughtful
readers
coleridge
says
in
his
preface
to
southey
of
wesley
that
it
was
more
often
in
his
hands
than
any
other
in
his
ragged
to
this
work
and
to
the
life
of
richard
baxter
he
says
i
was
used
to
resort
whenever
sickness
and
languor
made
me
feel
the
want
of
an
old
friend
of
whose
company
i
could
never
be
tired
how
many
and
many
an
hour
of
do
i
owe
to
this
life
of
wesley
and
how
often
have
i
argued
with
it
questioned
remonstrated
been
peevish
and
asked
pardon
then
again
listened
and
cried
excellent
and
in
yet
heavier
hours
entreated
it
as
it
were
to
continue
talking
to
me
for
that
i
heard
and
listened
and
was
soothed
though
i
could
make
no
reply
soumet
had
only
a
very
few
hooks
in
his
library
but
they
were
of
the
best
homer
virgil
dante
camoens
tasso
and
milton
de
favourite
few
were
donne
chillingworth
jeremy
taylor
milton
south
barrow
and
sir
thomas
browne
he
described
these
writers
as
a
pleiad
or
constellation
of
seven
golden
stars
such
as
in
their
class
no
literature
can
match
and
from
whose
works
he
would
undertake
to
build
up
an
entire
body
of
philosophy
frederick
the
great
of
prussia
manifested
his
strong
french
leanings
in
his
choice
of
books
his
principal
favourites
being
bayle
rousseau
voltaire
rollin
fleury
malebranche
and
one
english
author
locke
his
especial
favourite
was
bayle
dictionary
which
was
the
first
book
that
laid
hold
of
his
mind
and
he
thought
so
highly
of
it
that
he
himself
made
an
abridgment
and
translation
of
it
into
german
which
was
published
it
was
a
saying
of
frederick
that
books
make
up
no
small
part
of
true
happiness
in
his
old
age
he
said
my
latest
passion
will
be
for
literature
it
seems
odd
that
marshal
blucher
favourite
book
should
have
been
klopstock
and
napoleon
buonaparte
favourites
and
the
of
werther
but
napoleon
range
of
reading
was
very
extensive
it
included
homer
virgil
tasso
novels
of
all
countries
histories
of
all
times
mathematics
legislation
and
theology
he
detested
what
he
called
the
bombast
and
tinsel
of
voltaire
the
praises
of
homer
and
ossian
he
was
never
wearied
of
sounding
read
again
he
said
to
an
officer
on
board
the
belleropho
read
again
the
poet
of
achilles
devour
ossian
those
are
the
poets
who
lift
up
the
soul
and
give
to
man
a
colossal
greatness
the
duke
of
wellington
was
an
extensive
reader
his
principal
favourites
were
clarendon
bishop
butler
smith
of
nations
hume
the
archduke
charles
leslie
and
the
bible
he
was
also
particularly
interested
by
french
and
english
memoirs
more
especially
the
french
memoires
pour
servir
of
all
kinds
when
at
walmer
gleig
says
the
bible
the
prayer
book
taylor
living
and
dying
and
lay
within
the
duke
reach
and
judging
by
the
marks
of
use
on
them
they
must
have
been
much
read
and
often
consulted
while
books
are
among
the
best
companions
of
old
age
they
are
often
the
best
inspirers
of
youth
the
first
book
that
makes
a
deep
impression
on
a
young
man
mind
often
constitutes
an
epoch
in
his
life
it
may
fire
the
heart
stimulate
the
enthusiasm
and
by
directing
his
efforts
into
unexpected
channels
permanently
influence
his
character
the
new
book
in
which
we
form
an
intimacy
with
a
new
friend
whose
mind
is
wiser
and
riper
than
our
own
may
thus
form
an
important
in
the
history
of
a
life
it
may
sometimes
almost
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
new
birth
from
the
day
when
james
edward
smith
was
presented
with
his
first
botanical
and
sir
joseph
banks
fell
in
with
from
the
time
when
alfieri
first
read
plutarch
and
schiller
made
his
first
acquaintance
with
shakspeare
and
gibbon
devoured
the
first
volume
of
universal
history
each
dated
an
inspiration
so
exalted
that
they
felt
as
if
their
real
lives
had
only
then
begun
in
the
earlier
part
of
his
youth
la
fontaine
was
distinguished
for
his
idleness
but
hearing
an
ode
by
malherbe
read
he
is
said
to
have
exclaimed
i
too
am
a
poet
and
his
genius
was
awakened
charles
bossuet
mind
was
first
fired
to
study
by
reading
at
an
early
age
fontenelle
of
men
of
science
another
work
of
fontenelle
the
plurality
of
worlds
influenced
the
mind
of
lalande
in
making
choice
of
a
profession
it
is
with
pleasure
says
lalande
himself
in
a
preface
to
the
book
which
he
afterwards
edited
that
i
acknowledge
my
obligation
to
it
for
that
devouring
activity
which
its
perusal
first
excited
in
me
at
the
age
of
sixteen
and
which
i
have
since
retained
in
like
manner
lacepede
was
directed
to
the
study
of
natural
history
by
the
perusal
of
buffon
naturelle
which
he
found
in
his
father
library
and
read
over
and
over
again
until
he
almost
knew
it
by
heart
goethe
was
greatly
influenced
by
the
reading
of
of
wakefield
just
at
the
critical
moment
of
his
mental
development
and
he
attributed
to
it
much
of
his
best
education
the
reading
of
a
prose
of
gotz
vou
berlichingen
afterwards
stimulated
him
to
delineate
his
character
in
a
poetic
form
the
figure
of
a
rude
he
said
in
a
wild
anarchic
time
excited
my
deepest
sympathy
keats
was
an
insatiable
reader
when
a
boy
but
it
was
the
perusal
of
the
queen
at
the
age
of
seventeen
that
first
lit
the
fire
of
his
genius
the
same
poem
is
also
said
to
have
been
the
inspirer
of
cowley
who
found
a
copy
of
it
accidentally
lying
on
the
window
of
his
apartment
and
reading
and
admiring
it
he
became
as
he
relates
irrecoverably
a
poet
coleridge
speaks
of
the
great
influence
which
the
poems
of
bowles
had
in
forming
his
own
mind
the
works
of
a
past
age
says
he
seem
to
a
young
man
to
be
things
of
another
race
but
the
writings
of
a
contemporary
possess
a
reality
for
him
and
inspire
an
actual
friendship
as
of
a
man
for
a
man
his
very
admiration
is
the
wind
which
fans
and
feeds
his
hope
the
poems
themselves
assume
the
properties
of
flesh
and
blood
but
men
have
not
merely
been
stimulated
to
undertake
special
literary
pursuits
by
the
perusal
of
particular
books
they
have
been
also
stimulated
by
them
to
enter
upon
particular
lines
of
action
in
the
serious
business
of
life
thus
henry
martyn
was
powerfully
influenced
to
enter
upon
his
heroic
career
as
a
missionary
by
perusing
the
lives
of
henry
brainerd
and
carey
who
had
opened
up
the
furrows
in
which
he
went
forth
to
sow
the
seed
bentham
has
described
the
extraordinary
influence
which
the
perusal
of
exercised
upon
his
mind
in
boyhood
another
book
said
he
and
of
far
higher
character
a
collection
of
fairy
tales
to
which
he
refers
was
placed
in
my
hands
it
was
in
my
own
imagination
and
at
the
age
of
six
or
seven
i
identified
my
own
personality
with
that
of
the
hero
who
seemed
to
me
a
model
of
perfect
virtue
and
in
my
walk
of
life
whatever
it
may
come
to
be
why
i
to
myself
every
now
and
then
why
should
not
i
be
a
telemachus
that
romance
may
be
regarded
as
the
of
my
whole
character
the
from
whence
my
career
of
life
commenced
the
first
dawning
in
my
mind
of
the
of
utility
may
i
think
be
traced
to
it
cobbett
first
favourite
because
his
only
book
which
he
bought
for
threepence
was
swift
of
a
tub
the
repeated
perusal
of
which
had
doubtless
much
to
do
with
the
formation
of
his
pithy
straightforward
and
style
of
writing
the
delight
with
which
pope
when
a
schoolboy
read
ogilvy
was
most
probably
the
origin
of
the
english
as
the
reliques
fired
the
juvenile
mind
of
scott
and
stimulated
him
to
enter
upon
the
collection
and
composition
of
his
ballads
keightley
first
reading
of
lost
when
a
boy
led
to
his
afterwards
undertaking
his
life
of
the
poet
the
reading
he
says
of
lost
for
the
first
time
forms
or
should
form
an
era
in
the
life
of
every
one
possessed
of
taste
and
poetic
feeling
to
my
mind
that
time
is
ever
present
ever
since
the
poetry
of
milton
has
formed
my
constant
study
a
source
of
delight
in
prosperity
of
strength
and
consolation
in
adversity
good
books
are
thus
among
the
best
of
companions
and
by
elevating
the
thoughts
and
aspirations
they
act
as
preservatives
against
low
associations
a
natural
turn
for
reading
and
intellectual
pursuits
says
thomas
hood
probably
preserved
me
from
the
moral
shipwreck
so
apt
to
befal
those
who
are
deprived
in
early
life
of
their
parental
pilotage
my
books
kept
me
from
the
ring
the
dogpit
the
tavern
the
saloon
the
closet
associate
of
pope
and
addison
the
mind
accustomed
to
the
noble
though
silent
discourse
of
shakspeare
and
milton
will
hardly
seek
or
put
up
with
low
company
and
slaves
it
has
been
truly
said
that
the
best
books
are
those
which
most
resemble
good
actions
they
are
purifying
elevating
and
sustaining
they
enlarge
and
liberalize
the
mind
they
preserve
it
against
vulgar
worldliness
they
tend
to
produce
highminded
cheerfulness
and
equanimity
of
character
they
fashion
and
shape
and
humanize
the
mind
in
the
northern
universities
the
schools
in
which
the
ancient
classics
are
studied
are
appropriately
styled
the
humanity
classes
erasmus
the
great
scholar
was
even
of
opinion
that
books
were
the
necessaries
of
life
and
clothes
the
luxuries
and
he
frequently
postponed
buying
the
latter
until
he
had
supplied
himself
with
the
former
his
greatest
favourites
were
the
works
of
cicero
which
he
says
he
always
felt
himself
the
better
for
reading
i
can
never
he
says
read
the
works
of
cicero
on
age
or
or
his
disputations
without
fervently
pressing
them
to
my
lips
without
being
penetrated
with
veneration
for
a
mind
little
short
of
inspired
by
god
himself
it
was
the
accidental
perusal
of
which
first
detached
augustine
until
then
a
profligate
and
abandoned
sensualist
from
his
immoral
life
and
started
him
upon
the
course
of
inquiry
and
study
which
led
to
his
becoming
the
greatest
among
the
fathers
of
the
early
church
sir
william
jones
made
it
a
practice
to
read
through
once
a
year
the
writings
of
cicero
whose
life
indeed
says
his
biographer
was
the
great
exemplar
of
his
own
when
the
good
old
puritan
baxter
came
to
enumerate
the
valuable
and
delightful
things
of
which
death
would
deprive
him
his
mind
reverted
to
the
pleasures
he
had
derived
from
books
and
study
when
i
die
he
said
i
must
depart
not
only
from
sensual
delights
but
from
the
more
manly
pleasures
of
my
studies
knowledge
and
converse
with
many
wise
and
godly
men
and
from
all
my
pleasure
in
reading
hearing
public
and
private
exercises
of
religion
and
such
like
i
must
leave
my
library
and
turn
over
those
pleasant
books
no
more
i
must
no
more
come
among
the
living
nor
see
the
faces
of
my
faithful
friends
nor
be
seen
of
man
houses
and
cities
and
fields
and
countries
gardens
and
walks
will
be
as
nothing
to
me
i
shall
no
more
hear
of
the
affairs
of
the
world
of
man
or
wars
or
other
news
nor
see
what
becomes
of
that
beloved
interest
of
wisdom
piety
and
peace
which
i
desire
may
prosper
it
is
unnecessary
to
speak
of
the
enormous
moral
influence
which
books
have
exercised
upon
the
general
civilization
of
mankind
from
the
bible
downwards
they
contain
the
treasured
knowledge
of
the
human
race
they
are
the
record
of
all
labours
achievements
speculations
successes
and
failures
in
science
philosophy
religion
and
morals
they
have
been
the
greatest
motive
powers
in
all
times
from
the
gospel
to
the
contrat
social
says
de
bonald
it
is
books
that
have
made
revolutions
indeed
a
great
book
is
often
a
greater
thing
than
a
great
battle
even
works
of
fiction
have
occasionally
exercised
immense
power
on
society
thus
rabelais
in
france
and
cervantes
in
spain
overturned
at
the
same
time
the
dominion
of
monkery
and
chivalry
employing
no
other
weapons
but
ridicule
the
natural
contrast
of
human
terror
the
people
laughed
and
felt
reassured
so
appeared
and
recalled
men
back
to
the
harmonies
of
nature
poets
says
hazlitt
are
a
race
than
heroes
they
breathe
more
of
the
air
of
immortality
they
survive
more
entire
in
their
thoughts
and
acts
we
have
all
that
virgil
or
homer
did
as
much
as
if
we
had
lived
at
the
same
time
with
them
we
can
hold
their
works
in
our
hands
or
lay
them
on
our
pillows
or
put
them
to
our
lips
scarcely
a
trace
of
what
the
others
did
is
left
upon
the
earth
so
as
to
be
visible
to
common
eyes
the
one
the
dead
authors
are
living
men
still
breathing
and
moving
in
their
writings
the
others
the
conquerors
of
the
world
are
but
the
ashes
in
an
urn
the
sympathy
to
speak
between
thought
and
thought
is
more
intimate
and
vital
than
that
between
thought
and
action
thought
is
linked
to
thought
as
flame
kindles
into
flame
the
tribute
of
admiration
to
the
manes
of
departed
heroism
is
like
burning
incense
in
a
marble
monument
words
ideas
feelings
with
the
progress
of

the
character
of
men
as
of
women
is
powerfully
influenced
by
their
companionship
in
all
the
stages
of
life
we
have
already
spoken
of
the
influence
of
the
mother
in
forming
the
character
of
her
children
she
makes
the
moral
atmosphere
in
which
they
live
and
by
which
their
minds
and
souls
are
nourished
as
their
bodies
are
by
the
physical
atmosphere
they
breathe
and
while
woman
is
the
natural
cherisher
of
infancy
and
the

by

created
man

each

neither
can

nor

the

of

are
perfectly
distinct
woman

on

own
account

on

at

each
has

needs
both
for
the
purposes
of
the
race
and
in
every
consideration
of
social
progress
both
must
necessarily
be
included
though
companions
and
equals
yet
as
regards
the
measure
of
their
powers
they
are
unequal
man
is
stronger
more
muscular
and
of
rougher
fibre
woman
is
more
delicate
sensitive
and
nervous
the
one
excels
in
power
of
brain
the
other
in
qualities
of
heart
and
though
the
head
may
rule
it
is
the
heart
that
influences
both
are
alike
adapted
for
the
respective
functions
they
have
to
perform
in

to
attempt
to
impose

work
upon

would
be
quite
as
absurd
as
to
attempt
to
impose

work
upon
woman
men
are
sometimes
womanlike
and
women
are
sometimes
manlike
but
these
are
only
exceptions
which
prove
the
rule
although
man
qualities
belong
more
to
the
head
and
woman
more
to
the
heart
yet
it
is
not
less
necessary
that
man
heart
should
be
cultivated
as
well
as
his
head
and
woman
head
cultivated
as
well
as
her
heart
a
heartless
man
is
as
much
in
civilized
society
as
a
stupid
and
unintelligent
woman
the
cultivation
of
all
parts
of
the
moral
and
intellectual
nature
is
requisite
to
form
the
man
or
woman
of
healthy
and
character
without
sympathy
or
consideration
for
others
man
were
a
poor
stunted
sordid
selfish
being
and
without
cultivated
intelligence
the
most
beautiful
woman
were
little
better
than
a
doll
it
used
to
be
a
favourite
notion
about
woman
that
her
weakness
and
dependency
upon
others
constituted
her
principal
claim
to
admiration
if
we
were
to
form
an
image
of
dignity
in
a
man
said
sir
richard
steele
we
should
give
him
wisdom
and
valour
as
being
essential
to
the
character
of
manhood
in
like
manner
if
you
describe
a
right
woman
in
a
laudable
sense
she
should
have
gentle
softness
tender
fear
and
all
those
parts
of
life
which
distinguish
her
from
the
other
sex
with
some
subordination
to
it
but
an
inferiority
which
makes
her
lovely
thus
her
weakness
was
to
be
cultivated
rather
than
her
strength
her
folly
rather
than
her
wisdom
she
was
to
be
a
weak
fearful
tearful
characterless
inferior
creature
with
just
sense
enough
to
understand
the
soft
nothings
addressed
to
her
by
the
superior
sex
she
was
to
be
educated
as
an
ornamental
appanage
of
man
rather
as
an
independent
intelligence
or
as
a
wife
mother
companion
or
friend
pope
in
one
of
his
essays
asserts
that
most
women
have
no
characters
at
all
and
again
he
says
ladies
like
variegated
tulips
show
is
to
their
changes
half
their
charms
we
owe
fine
by
defect
and
delicately
weak
this
satire
characteristically
occurs
in
the
poet
to
martha
blount
the
housekeeper
who
so
tyrannically
ruled
him
and
in
the
same
verses
he
spitefully
girds
at
lady
mary
wortley
montague
at
whose
feet
he
had
thrown
himself
as
a
lover
and
been
contemptuously
rejected
but
pope
was
no
judge
of
women
nor
was
he
even
a
very
wise
or
tolerant
judge
of
men
it
is
still
too
much
the
practice
to
cultivate
the
weakness
of
woman
rather
than
her
strength
and
to
render
her
attractive
rather
than
her
sensibilities
are
developed
at
the
expense
of
her
health
of
body
as
well
as
of
mind
she
lives
moves
and
has
her
being
in
the
sympathy
of
others
she
dresses
that
she
may
attract
and
is
burdened
with
accomplishments
that
she
may
be
chosen
weak
trembling
and
dependent
she
incurs
the
risk
of
becoming
a
living
embodiment
of
the
italian
proverb
so
good
that
she
is
good
for
nothing
on
the
other
hand
the
education
of
young
men
too
often
errs
on
the
side
of
selfishness
while
the
boy
is
incited
to
trust
mainly
to
his
own
efforts
in
pushing
his
way
in
the
world
the
girl
is
encouraged
to
rely
almost
entirely
upon
others
he
is
educated
with
too
exclusive
reference
to
himself
and
she
is
educated
with
too
exclusive
reference
to
him
he
is
taught
to
be
and
while
she
is
taught
to
be
distrustful
of
herself
dependent
and
in
all
things
thus
the
intellect
of
the
one
is
cultivated
at
the
expense
of
the
affections
and
the
affections
of
the
other
at
the
expense
of
the
intellect
it
is
unquestionable
that
the
highest
qualities
of
woman
are
displayed
in
her
relationship
to
others
through
the
medium
of
her
affections
she
is
the
nurse
whom
nature
has
given
to
all
humankind
she
takes
charge
of
the
helpless
and
nourishes
and
cherishes
those
we
love
she
is
the
presiding
genius
of
the
fireside
where
she
creates
an
atmosphere
of
serenity
and
contentment
suitable
for
the
nurture
and
growth
of
character
in
its
best
forms
she
is
by
her
very
constitution
compassionate
gentle
patient
and
loving
hopeful
trustful
her
eye
sheds
brightness
everywhere
it
shines
upon
coldness
and
warms
it
upon
suffering
and
relieves
it
upon
sorrow
and
cheers
it
her
silver
flow
of
counsel
in
distress
right
to
the
heart
and
brain
though
undescried
winning
its
way
with
extreme
gentleness
through
all
the
outworks
of
suspicion
pride
woman
has
been
styled
the
angel
of
the
unfortunate
she
is
ready
to
help
the
weak
to
raise
the
fallen
to
comfort
the
suffering
it
was
characteristic
of
woman
that
she
should
have
been
the
first
to
build
and
endow
an
hospital
it
has
been
said
that
wherever
a
human
being
is
in
suffering
his
sighs
call
a
woman
to
his
side
when
mungo
park
lonely
friendless
and
famished
after
being
driven
forth
from
an
african
village
by
the
men
was
preparing
to
spend
the
night
under
a
tree
exposed
to
the
rain
and
the
wild
beasts
which
there
abounded
a
poor
negro
woman
returning
from
the
labours
of
the
field
took
compassion
upon
him
conducted
him
into
her
hut
and
there
gave
him
food
succour
and
shelter
but
while
the
most
characteristic
qualities
of
woman
are
displayed
through
her
sympathies
and
affections
it
is
also
necessary
for
her
own
happiness
as
a
being
to
develope
and
strengthen
her
character
by
due
and
it
is
not
desirable
even
were
it
possible
to
close
the
beautiful
avenues
of
the
heart
of
the
best
kind
does
not
involve
any
limitation
in
the
range
of
human
sympathy
but
the
happiness
of
woman
as
of
man
depends
in
a
great
measure
upon
her
individual
completeness
of
character
and
that
which
springs
from
the
due
cultivation
of
the
intellectual
powers
conjoined
with
a
proper
discipline
of
the
heart
and
conscience
will
enable
her
to
be
more
useful
in
life
as
well
as
happy
to
dispense
blessings
intelligently
as
well
as
to
enjoy
them
and
most
of
all
those
which
spring
from
mutual
dependence
and
social
sympathy
to
maintain
a
high
standard
of
purity
in
society
the
culture
of
both
sexes
must
be
in
harmony
and
keep
equal
pace
a
pure
womanhood
must
be
accompanied
by
a
pure
manhood
the
same
moral
law
applies
alike
to
both
it
would
be
loosening
the
foundations
of
virtue
to
countenance
the
notion
that
because
of
a
difference
in
sex
man
were
at
liberty
to
set
morality
at
defiance
and
to
do
that
with
impunity
which
if
done
by
a
woman
would
stain
her
character
for
life
to
maintain
a
pure
and
virtuous
condition
of
society
therefore
man
as
well
as
woman
must
be
pure
and
virtuous
both
alike
shunning
all
acts
impinging
on
the
heart
character
and
conscience
shunning
them
as
poison
which
once
imbibed
can
never
be
entirely
thrown
out
again
but
mentally
embitters
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
the
happiness
of
and
here
we
would
venture
to
touch
upon
a
delicate
topic
though
it
is
one
of
universal
and
engrossing
human
interest
the
moralist
avoids
it
the
educator
shuns
it
and
parents
taboo
it
it
is
almost
considered
indelicate
to
refer
to
love
as
between
the
sexes
and
young
persons
are
left
to
gather
their
only
notions
of
it
from
the
impossible
that
fill
the
shelves
of
circulating
libraries
this
strong
and
absorbing
feeling
this
besoin
which
nature
has
for
wise
purposes
made
so
strong
in
woman
that
it
colours
her
whole
life
and
history
though
it
may
form
but
an
episode
in
the
life
of
man
is
usually
left
to
follow
its
own
inclinations
and
to
grow
up
for
the
most
part
unchecked
without
any
guidance
or
direction
whatever
although
nature
spurns
all
formal
rules
and
directions
in
affairs
of
love
it
might
at
all
events
be
possible
to
implant
in
young
minds
such
views
of
character
as
should
enable
them
to
discriminate
between
the
true
and
the
false
and
to
accustom
them
to
hold
in
esteem
those
qualities
of
moral
purity
and
integrity
without
which
life
is
but
a
scene
of
folly
and
misery
it
may
not
be
possible
to
teach
young
people
to
love
wisely
but
they
may
at
least
be
guarded
by
parental
advice
against
the
frivolous
and
despicable
passions
which
so
often
usurp
its
name
love
it
has
been
said
in
the
common
acceptation
of
the
term
is
folly
but
love
in
its
purity
its
loftiness
its
unselfishness
is
not
only
a
consequence
but
a
proof
of
our
moral
excellence
the
sensibility
to
moral
beauty
the
forgetfulness
of
self
in
the
admiration
engendered
by
it
all
prove
its
claim
to
a
high
moral
influence
it
is
the
triumph
of
the
unselfish
over
the
selfish
part
of
our
nature
it
is
by
means
of
this
divine
passion
that
the
world
is
kept
ever
fresh
and
young
it
is
the
perpetual
melody
of
humanity
it
sheds
an
effulgence
upon
youth
and
throws
a
halo
round
age
it
glorifies
the
present
by
the
light
it
casts
backward
and
it
lightens
the
future
by
the
beams
it
casts
forward
the
love
which
is
the
outcome
of
esteem
and
admiration
has
an
elevating
and
purifying
effect
on
the
character
it
tends
to
emancipate
one
from
the
slavery
of
self
it
is
altogether
unsordid
itself
is
its
only
price
it
inspires
gentleness
sympathy
mutual
faith
and
confidence
true
love
also
in
a
measure
elevates
the
intellect
all
love
renders
wise
in
a
degree
says
the
poet
browning
and
the
most
gifted
minds
have
been
the
sincerest
lovers
great
souls
make
all
affections
great
they
elevate
and
consecrate
all
true
delights
the
sentiment
even
brings
to
light
qualities
before
lying
dormant
and
unsuspected
it
elevates
the
aspirations
expands
the
soul
and
stimulates
the
mental
powers
one
of
the
finest
compliments
ever
paid
to
a
woman
was
that
of
steele
when
he
said
of
lady
elizabeth
hastings
that
to
have
loved
her
was
a
liberal
education
viewed
in
this
light
woman
is
an
educator
in
the
highest
sense
because
above
all
other
educators
she
educates
humanly
and
lovingly
it
has
been
said
that
no
man
and
no
woman
can
be
regarded
as
complete
in
their
experience
of
life
until
they
have
been
subdued
into
union
with
the
world
through
their
affections
as
woman
is
not
woman
until
she
has
known
love
neither
is
man
man
both
are
requisite
to
each
completeness
plato
entertained
the
idea
that
lovers
each
sought
a
likeness
in
the
other
and
that
love
was
only
the
divorced
half
of
the
original
human
being
entering
into
union
with
its
counterpart
but
philosophy
would
here
seem
to
be
at
fault
for
affection
quite
as
often
springs
from
unlikeness
as
from
likeness
in
its
object
the
true
union
must
needs
be
one
of
mind
as
well
as
of
heart
and
based
on
mutual
esteem
as
well
as
mutual
affection
no
true
and
enduring
love
says
fichte
can
exist
without
esteem
every
other
draws
regret
after
it
and
is
unworthy
of
any
noble
human
soul
one
can
not
really
love
the
bad
but
always
something
that
we
esteem
and
respect
as
well
as
admire
in
short
true
union
must
rest
on
qualities
of
character
which
rule
in
domestic
as
in
public
life
but
there
is
something
far
more
than
mere
respect
and
esteem
in
the
union
between
man
and
wife
the
feeling
on
which
it
rests
is
far
deeper
and
tenderer
such
indeed
as
never
exists
between
men
or
between
women
in
matters
of
affection
says
nathaniel
hawthorne
there
is
always
an
impassable
gulf
between
man
and
man
they
can
never
quite
grasp
each
other
hands
and
therefore
man
never
derives
any
intimate
help
any
from
his
brother
man
but
from
woman
his
mother
his
sister
or
his
wife
man
enters
a
new
world
of
joy
and
sympathy
and
human
interest
through
the
porch
of
love
he
enters
a
new
world
in
his
home
the
home
of
his
own
making
altogether
different
from
the
home
of
his
boyhood
where
each
day
brings
with
it
a
succession
of
new
joys
and
experiences
he
enters
also
it
may
be
a
new
world
of
trials
and
sorrows
in
which
he
often
gathers
his
best
culture
and
discipline
family
life
says
may
be
full
of
thorns
and
cares
but
they
are
fruitful
all
others
are
dry
thorns
and
again
if
a
man
home
at
a
certain
period
of
life
does
not
contain
children
it
will
probably
be
found
filled
with
follies
or
with
vices
a
life
exclusively
occupied
in
affairs
of
business
insensibly
tends
to
narrow
and
harden
the
character
it
is
mainly
occupied
with
for
advantages
and
guarding
against
sharp
practice
on
the
part
of
others
thus
the
character
unconsciously
tends
to
grow
suspicious
and
ungenerous
the
best
corrective
of
such
influences
is
always
the
domestic
by
withdrawing
the
mind
from
thoughts
that
are
wholly
gainful
by
taking
it
out
of
its
daily
rut
and
bringing
it
back
to
the
sanctuary
of
home
for
refreshment
and
rest
that
truest
rarest
light
of
social
joy
which
gleams
upon
the
man
of
many
cares
business
says
sir
henry
taylor
does
but
lay
waste
the
approaches
to
the
heart
whilst
marriage
garrisons
the
fortress
and
however
the
head
may
be
occupied
by
labours
of
ambition
or
of
business
if
the
heart
be
not
occupied
by
affection
for
others
and
sympathy
with
them
life
though
it
may
appear
to
the
outer
world
to
be
a
success
will
probably
be
no
success
at
all
but
a
failure
a
man
real
character
will
always
be
more
visible
in
his
household
than
anywhere
else
and
his
practical
wisdom
will
be
better
exhibited
by
the
manner
in
which
he
bears
rule
there
than
even
in
the
larger
affairs
of
business
or
public
life
his
whole
mind
may
be
in
his
business
but
if
he
would
be
happy
his
whole
heart
must
be
in
his
home
it
is
there
that
his
genuine
qualities
most
surely
display
themselves
there
that
he
shows
his
truthfulness
his
love
his
sympathy
his
consideration
for
others
his
uprightness
his
manliness
in
a
word
his
character
if
affection
be
not
the
governing
principle
in
a
household
domestic
life
may
be
the
most
intolerable
of
despotisms
without
justice
also
there
can
be
neither
love
confidence
nor
respect
on
which
all
true
domestic
rule
is
founded
erasmus
speaks
of
sir
thomas
more
home
as
a
school
and
exercise
of
the
christian
religion
no
wrangling
no
angry
word
was
heard
in
it
no
one
was
idle
every
one
did
his
duty
with
alacrity
and
not
without
a
temperate
cheerfulness
sir
thomas
won
all
hearts
to
obedience
by
his
gentleness
he
was
a
man
clothed
in
household
goodness
and
he
ruled
so
gently
and
wisely
that
his
home
was
pervaded
by
an
atmosphere
of
love
and
duty
he
himself
spoke
of
the
hourly
interchange
of
the
smaller
acts
of
kindness
with
the
several
members
of
his
family
as
having
a
claim
upon
his
time
as
strong
as
those
other
public
occupations
of
his
life
which
seemed
to
others
so
much
more
serious
and
important
but
the
man
whose
affections
are
quickened
by
does
not
confine
his
sympathies
within
that
comparatively
narrow
sphere
his
love
enlarges
in
the
family
and
through
the
family
it
expands
into
the
world
love
says
emerson
is
a
fire
that
kindling
its
first
embers
in
the
narrow
nook
of
a
private
bosom
caught
from
a
wandering
spark
out
of
another
private
heart
glows
and
enlarges
until
it
warms
and
beams
upon
multitudes
of
men
and
women
upon
the
universal
heart
of
all
and
so
lights
up
the
whole
world
and
nature
with
its
generous
flames
it
is
by
the
regimen
of
domestic
affection
that
the
heart
of
man
is
best
composed
and
regulated
the
home
is
the
woman
kingdom
her
state
her
world
where
she
governs
by
affection
by
kindness
by
the
power
of
gentleness
there
is
nothing
which
so
settles
the
turbulence
of
a
nature
as
his
union
in
life
with
a
highminded
woman
there
he
finds
rest
contentment
and
happiness
rest
of
brain
and
peace
of
spirit
he
will
also
often
find
in
her
his
best
counsellor
for
her
instinctive
tact
will
usually
lead
him
right
when
his
own
unaided
reason
might
be
apt
to
go
wrong
the
true
wife
is
a
staff
to
lean
upon
in
times
of
trial
and
difficulty
and
she
is
never
wanting
in
sympathy
and
solace
when
distress
occurs
or
fortune
frowns
in
the
time
of
youth
she
is
a
comfort
and
an
ornament
of
man
life
and
she
remains
a
faithful
helpmate
in
maturer
years
when
life
has
ceased
to
be
an
anticipation
and
we
live
in
its
realities
what
a
happy
man
must
edmund
burke
have
been
when
he
could
say
of
his
home
every
care
vanishes
the
moment
i
enter
under
my
own
roof
and
luther
a
man
full
of
human
affection
speaking
of
his
wife
said
i
would
not
exchange
my
poverty
with
her
for
all
the
riches
of
croesus
without
her
of
marriage
he
observed
the
utmost
blessing
that
god
can
confer
on
a
man
is
the
possession
of
a
good
and
pious
wife
with
whom
he
may
live
in
peace
and
tranquillity
to
whom
he
may
confide
his
whole
possessions
even
his
life
and
welfare
and
again
he
said
to
rise
betimes
and
to
marry
young
are
what
no
man
ever
repents
of
doing
for
a
man
to
enjoy
true
repose
and
happiness
in
marriage
he
must
have
in
his
wife
a
as
well
as
a
helpmate
but
it
is
not
requisite
that
she
should
be
merely
a
pale
copy
of
himself
a
man
no
more
desires
in
his
wife
a
manly
woman
than
the
woman
desires
in
her
husband
a
feminine
man
a
woman
best
qualities
do
not
reside
in
her
intellect
but
in
her
affections
she
gives
refreshment
by
her
sympathies
rather
than
by
her
knowledge
the
says
oliver
wendell
holmes
never
interest
us
like
the
men
are
often
so
wearied
with
themselves
that
they
are
rather
predisposed
to
admire
qualities
and
tastes
in
others
different
from
their
own
if
i
were
suddenly
asked
says
mr
helps
to
give
a
proof
of
the
goodness
of
god
to
us
i
think
i
should
say
that
it
is
most
manifest
in
the
exquisite
difference
he
has
made
between
the
souls
of
men
and
women
so
as
to
create
the
possibility
of
the
most
comforting
and
charming
companionship
that
the
mind
of
man
can
imagine
but
though
no
man
may
love
a
woman
for
her
understanding
it
is
not
the
less
necessary
for
her
to
cultivate
it
on
that
account
there
may
be
difference
in
character
but
there
must
be
harmony
of
mind
and
sentiment
two
intelligent
souls
as
well
as
two
loving
hearts
two
heads
in
council
two
beside
the
hearth
two
in
the
tangled
business
of
the
world
two
in
the
liberal
offices
of
life
there
are
few
men
who
have
written
so
wisely
on
the
subject
of
marriage
as
sir
henry
taylor
what
he
says
about
the
influence
of
a
happy
union
in
its
relation
to
successful
statesmanship
applies
to
all
conditions
of
life
the
true
wife
he
says
should
possess
such
qualities
as
will
tend
to
make
home
as
much
as
may
be
a
place
of
repose
to
this
end
she
should
have
sense
enough
or
worth
enough
to
exempt
her
husband
as
much
as
possible
from
the
troubles
of
family
management
and
more
especially
from
all
possibility
of
debt
she
should
be
pleasing
to
his
eyes
and
to
his
taste
the
taste
goes
deep
into
the
nature
of
all
men
love
is
hardly
apart
from
it
and
in
a
life
of
care
and
excitement
that
home
which
is
not
the
seat
of
love
can
not
be
a
place
of
repose
rest
for
the
brain
and
peace
for
the
spirit
being
only
to
be
had
through
the
softening
of
the
affections
he
should
look
for
a
clear
understanding
cheerfulness
and
alacrity
of
mind
rather
than
gaiety
and
brilliancy
and
for
a
gentle
tenderness
of
disposition
in
preference
to
an
impassioned
nature
lively
talents
are
too
stimulating
in
a
tired
house
passion
is
too
disturbing
her
love
should
be
a
love
that
clings
not
nor
is
exigent
encumbers
not
the
active
purposes
nor
drains
their
source
but
profers
with
free
grace
pleasure
at
pleasure
touched
at
pleasure
waived
a
washing
of
the
weary
traveller
feet
a
quenching
of
his
thirst
a
sweet
repose
alternate
and
preparative
in
groves
where
loving
much
the
flower
that
loves
the
shade
and
loving
much
the
shade
that
that
flower
loves
he
yet
is
unbewildered
unenslaved
thence
starting
light
and
pleasantly
let
go
when
serious
service
calls
some
persons
are
disappointed
in
marriage
because
they
expect
too
much
from
it
but
many
more
because
they
do
not
bring
into
the
their
fair
share
of
cheerfulness
kindliness
forbearance
and
common
sense
their
imagination
has
perhaps
pictured
a
condition
never
experienced
on
this
side
heaven
and
when
real
life
comes
with
its
troubles
and
cares
there
is
a
sudden
as
from
a
dream
or
they
look
for
something
approaching
perfection
in
their
chosen
companion
and
discover
by
experience
that
the
fairest
of
characters
have
their
weaknesses
yet
it
is
often
the
very
imperfection
of
human
nature
rather
than
its
perfection
that
makes
the
strongest
claims
on
the
forbearance
and
sympathy
of
others
and
in
affectionate
and
sensible
natures
tends
to
produce
the
closest
unions
the
golden
rule
of
married
life
is
bear
and
forbear
marriage
like
government
is
a
series
of
compromises
one
must
give
and
take
refrain
and
restrain
endure
and
be
patient
one
may
not
be
blind
to
failings
but
they
may
be
borne
with
forbearance
of
all
qualities
good
temper
is
the
one
that
wears
and
works
the
best
in
married
life
conjoined
with
it
gives
patience
the
patience
to
bear
and
forbear
to
listen
without
retort
to
refrain
until
the
angry
flash
has
passed
how
true
it
is
in
marriage
that
the
soft
answer
turneth
away
wrath
burns
the
poet
in
speaking
of
the
qualities
of
a
good
wife
divided
them
into
ten
parts
four
of
these
he
gave
to
good
temper
two
to
good
sense
one
to
wit
one
to
beauty
such
as
a
sweet
face
eloquent
eyes
a
fine
person
a
graceful
carriage
and
the
other
two
parts
he
divided
amongst
the
other
qualities
belonging
to
or
attending
on
a
wife
such
as
fortune
connections
education
is
of
a
higher
standard
than
ordinary
family
blood
but
he
said
divide
those
two
degrees
as
you
please
only
remember
that
all
these
minor
proportions
must
be
expressed
by
fractions
for
there
is
not
any
one
of
them
that
is
entitled
to
the
dignity
of
an
integer
it
has
been
said
that
girls
are
very
good
at
making
nets
but
that
it
would
be
better
still
if
they
would
learn
to
make
cages
men
are
often
as
easily
caught
as
birds
but
as
difficult
to
keep
if
the
wife
can
not
make
her
home
bright
and
happy
so
that
it
shall
be
the
cleanest
sweetest
cheerfulest
place
that
her
husband
can
find
refuge
in
a
retreat
from
the
toils
and
troubles
of
the
outer
world
then
god
help
the
poor
man
for
he
is
virtually
homeless
no
wise
person
will
marry
for
beauty
mainly
it
may
exercise
a
powerful
attraction
in
the
first
place
but
it
is
found
to
be
of
comparatively
little
consequence
afterwards
not
that
beauty
of
person
is
to
be
underestimated
for
other
things
being
equal
handsomeness
of
form
and
beauty
of
features
are
the
outward
manifestations
of
health
but
to
marry
a
handsome
figure
without
character
fine
features
unbeautified
by
sentiment
or
is
the
most
deplorable
of
mistakes
as
even
the
finest
landscape
seen
daily
becomes
monotonous
so
does
the
most
beautiful
face
unless
a
beautiful
nature
shines
through
it
the
beauty
of
becomes
commonplace
whereas
goodness
displayed
through
the
most
ordinary
features
is
perennially
lovely
moreover
this
kind
of
beauty
improves
with
age
and
time
ripens
rather
than
destroys
it
after
the
first
year
married
people
rarely
think
of
each
other
features
and
whether
they
be
classically
beautiful
or
otherwise
but
they
never
fail
to
be
cognisant
of
each
other
temper
when
i
see
a
man
says
addison
with
a
sour
rivelled
face
i
can
not
forbear
pitying
his
wife
and
when
i
meet
with
an
open
ingenuous
countenance
i
think
of
the
happiness
of
his
friends
his
family
and
his
relations
we
have
given
the
views
of
the
poet
burns
as
to
the
qualities
necessary
in
a
good
wife
let
us
add
the
advice
given
by
lord
burleigh
to
his
son
embodying
the
experience
of
a
wise
statesman
and
practised
man
of
the
world
when
it
shall
please
god
said
he
to
bring
thee
to
estate
use
great
providence
and
circumspection
in
choosing
thy
wife
for
from
thence
will
spring
all
thy
future
good
or
evil
and
it
is
an
action
of
thy
life
like
unto
a
stratagem
of
war
wherein
a
man
can
err
but
once
enquire
diligently
of
her
disposition
and
how
her
parents
have
been
inclined
in
their
youth
let
her
not
be
poor
how
generous
soever
for
a
man
can
buy
nothing
in
the
market
with
gentility
nor
choose
a
base
and
uncomely
creature
altogether
for
wealth
for
it
will
cause
contempt
in
others
and
loathing
in
thee
neither
make
choice
of
a
dwarf
or
a
fool
for
by
the
one
thou
shalt
beget
a
race
of
pigmies
while
the
other
will
be
thy
continual
disgrace
and
it
will
yirke
thee
to
hear
her
talk
for
thou
shalt
find
it
to
thy
great
grief
that
there
is
nothing
more
fulsome
than
a
a
man
moral
character
is
necessarily
powerfully
influenced
by
his
wife
a
lower
nature
will
drag
him
down
as
a
higher
will
lift
him
up
the
former
will
deaden
his
sympathies
dissipate
his
energies
and
distort
his
life
while
the
latter
by
satisfying
his
affections
will
strengthen
his
moral
nature
and
by
giving
him
repose
tend
to
energise
his
intellect
not
only
so
but
a
woman
of
high
principles
will
insensibly
elevate
the
aims
and
purposes
of
her
husband
as
one
of
low
principles
will
unconsciously
degrade
them
de
tocqueville
was
profoundly
impressed
by
this
truth
he
entertained
the
opinion
that
man
could
have
no
such
mainstay
in
life
as
the
companionship
of
a
wife
of
good
temper
and
high
principle
he
says
that
in
the
course
of
his
life
he
had
seen
even
weak
men
display
real
public
virtue
because
they
had
by
their
side
a
woman
of
noble
character
who
sustained
them
in
their
career
and
exercised
a
fortifying
influence
on
their
views
of
public
duty
whilst
on
the
contrary
he
had
still
oftener
seen
men
of
great
and
generous
instincts
transformed
into
vulgar
by
contact
with
women
of
narrow
natures
devoted
to
an
imbecile
love
of
pleasure
and
from
whose
minds
the
grand
motive
of
duty
was
altogether
absent
de
tocqueville
himself
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
blessed
with
an
admirable
wife
and
in
his
letters
to
his
intimate
friends
he
spoke
most
gratefully
of
the
comfort
and
support
he
derived
from
her
sustaining
courage
her
equanimity
of
temper
and
her
nobility
of
character
the
more
indeed
that
de
tocqueville
saw
of
the
world
and
of
practical
life
the
more
convinced
he
became
of
the
necessity
of
healthy
domestic
conditions
for
a
man
growth
in
virtue
and
goodness
especially
did
he
regard
marriage
as
of
inestimable
importance
in
regard
to
a
man
true
happiness
and
he
was
accustomed
to
speak
of
his
own
as
the
wisest
action
of
his
life
many
external
circumstances
of
happiness
he
said
have
been
granted
to
me
but
more
than
all
i
have
to
thank
heaven
for
having
bestowed
on
me
true
domestic
happiness
the
first
of
human
blessings
as
i
grow
older
the
portion
of
my
life
which
in
my
youth
i
used
to
look
down
upon
every
day
becomes
more
important
in
my
eyes
and
would
now
easily
console
me
for
the
loss
of
all
the
rest
and
again
writing
to
his
de
kergorlay
he
said
of
all
the
blessings
which
god
has
given
to
me
the
greatest
of
all
in
my
eyes
is
to
have
lighted
on
marie
you
can
not
imagine
what
she
is
in
great
trials
usually
so
gentle
she
then
becomes
strong
and
energetic
she
watches
me
without
my
knowing
it
she
softens
calms
and
strengthens
me
in
difficulties
which
disturb
me
but
leave
her
serene
in
another
letter
he
says
i
can
not
describe
to
you
the
happiness
yielded
in
the
long
run
by
the
habitual
society
of
a
woman
in
whose
soul
all
that
is
good
in
your
own
is
reflected
naturally
and
even
improved
when
i
say
or
do
a
thing
which
seems
to
me
to
be
perfectly
right
i
read
immediately
in
marie
countenance
an
expression
of
proud
satisfaction
which
elevates
me
and
so
when
my
conscience
reproaches
me
her
face
instantly
clouds
over
although
i
have
great
power
over
her
mind
i
see
with
pleasure
that
she
awes
me
and
so
long
as
i
love
her
as
i
do
now
i
am
sure
that
i
shall
never
allow
myself
to
be
drawn
into
anything
that
is
wrong
in
the
retired
life
which
de
tocqueville
led
as
a
literary
man
political
life
being
closed
against
him
by
the
inflexible
independence
of
his
character
his
health
failed
and
he
became
ill
irritable
and
querulous
while
proceeding
with
his
last
work
regime
et
la
revolution
he
wrote
after
sitting
at
my
desk
for
five
or
six
hours
i
can
write
no
longer
the
machine
refuses
to
act
i
am
in
great
want
of
rest
and
of
a
long
rest
if
you
add
all
the
perplexities
that
besiege
an
author
towards
the
end
of
his
work
you
will
be
able
to
imagine
a
very
wretched
life
i
could
not
go
on
with
my
task
if
it
were
not
for
the
refreshing
calm
of
marie
companionship
it
would
be
impossible
to
find
a
disposition
forming
a
happier
contrast
to
my
own
in
my
perpetual
irritability
of
body
and
mind
she
is
a
providential
resource
that
never
fails

guizot
was
in
like
manner
sustained
and
encouraged
amidst
his
many
vicissitudes
and
disappointments
by
his
noble
wife
if
he
was
treated
with
harshness
by
his
political
enemies
his
consolation
was
in
the
tender
affection
which
filled
his
home
with
sunshine
though
his
public
life
was
bracing
and
stimulating
he
felt
nevertheless
that
it
was
cold
and
calculating
and
neither
filled
the
soul
nor
elevated
the
character
man
longs
for
a
happiness
he
says
in
his
more
complete
and
more
tender
than
that
which
all
the
labours
and
triumphs
of
active
exertion
and
public
importance
can
bestow
what
i
know
at
the
end
of
my
race
i
have
felt
when
it
began
and
during
its
continuance
even
in
the
midst
of
great
undertakings
domestic
affections
form
the
basis
of
life
and
the
most
brilliant
career
has
only
superficial
and
incomplete
enjoyments
if
a
stranger
to
the
happy
ties
of
family
and
friendship
the
circumstances
connected
with
guizot
courtship
and
marriage
are
curious
and
interesting
while
a
young
man
living
by
his
pen
in
paris
writing
books
reviews
and
translations
he
formed
a
casual
acquaintance
with
mademoiselle
pauline
de
meulan
a
lady
of
great
ability
then
editor
of
the
publiciste
a
severe
domestic
calamity
having
befallen
her
she
fell
ill
and
was
unable
for
a
time
to
carry
on
the
heavy
literary
work
connected
with
her
journal
at
this
juncture
a
letter
without
any
signature
reached
her
one
day
offering
a
supply
of
articles
which
the
writer
hoped
would
be
worthy
of
the
reputation
of
the
publiciste
the
articles
duly
arrived
were
accepted
and
published
they
dealt
with
a
great
variety
of
subjects
art
literature
theatricals
and
general
criticism
when
the
editor
at
length
recovered
from
her
illness
the
writer
of
the
articles
disclosed
himself
it
was
guizot
an
intimacy
sprang
up
between
them
which
ripened
into
mutual
affection
and
before
long
mademoiselle
de
meulan
became
his
wife
from
that
time
forward
she
shared
in
all
her
husband
joys
and
sorrows
as
well
as
in
many
of
his
labours
before
they
became
united
he
asked
her
if
she
thought
she
should
ever
become
dismayed
at
the
vicissitudes
of
his
destiny
which
he
then
saw
looming
before
him
she
replied
that
he
might
assure
himself
that
she
would
always
passionately
enjoy
his
triumphs
but
never
heave
a
sigh
over
his
defeats
when
guizot
became
first
minister
of
louis
philippe
she
wrote
to
a
friend
i
now
see
my
husband
much
less
than
i
desire
but
still
i
see
him
if
god
spares
us
to
each
other
i
shall
always
be
in
the
midst
of
every
trial
and
apprehension
the
happiest
of
beings
little
more
than
six
months
after
these
words
were
written
the
devoted
wife
was
laid
in
her
grave
and
her
sorrowing
husband
was
left
thenceforth
to
tread
the
journey
of
life
alone
burke
was
especially
happy
in
his
union
with
miss
nugent
a
beautiful
affectionate
and
highminded
woman
the
agitation
and
anxiety
of
his
public
life
was
more
than
compensated
by
his
domestic
happiness
which
seems
to
have
been
complete
it
was
a
saying
of
burke
thoroughly
illustrative
of
his
character
that
to
love
the
little
platoon
we
belong
to
in
society
is
the
germ
of
all
public
affections
his
description
of
his
wife
in
her
youth
is
probably
one
of
the
finest
in
the
language
she
is
handsome
but
it
is
a
beauty
not
arising
from
features
from
complexion
or
from
shape
she
has
all
three
in
a
high
degree
but
it
is
not
by
these
she
touches
the
heart
it
is
all
that
sweetness
of
temper
benevolence
innocence
and
sensibility
which
a
face
can
express
that
forms
her
beauty
she
has
a
face
that
just
raises
your
attention
at
first
sight
it
grows
on
you
every
moment
and
you
wonder
it
did
no
more
than
raise
your
attention
at
first
her
eyes
have
a
mild
light
but
they
awe
when
she
pleases
they
command
like
a
good
man
out
of
office
not
by
authority
but
by
virtue
her
stature
is
not
tall
she
is
not
made
to
be
the
admiration
of
everybody
but
the
happiness
of
one
she
has
all
the
firmness
that
does
not
exclude
delicacy
she
has
all
the
softness
that
does
not
imply
weakness
her
voice
is
a
soft
low
music
not
formed
to
rule
in
public
assemblies
but
to
charm
those
who
can
distinguish
a
company
from
a
crowd
it
has
this
advantage
you
must
come
close
to
her
to
hear
it
to
describe
her
body
describes
her
mind
one
is
the
transcript
of
the
other
her
understanding
is
not
shown
in
the
variety
of
matters
it
exerts
itself
on
but
in
the
goodness
of
the
choice
she
makes
she
does
not
display
it
so
much
in
saying
or
doing
striking
things
as
in
avoiding
such
as
she
ought
not
to
say
or
do
no
person
of
so
few
years
can
know
the
world
better
no
person
was
ever
less
corrupted
by
the
knowledge
of
it
her
politeness
flows
rather
from
a
natural
disposition
to
oblige
than
from
any
rules
on
that
subject
and
therefore
never
fails
to
strike
those
who
understand
good
breeding
and
those
who
do
not
she
has
a
steady
and
firm
mind
which
takes
no
more
from
the
solidity
of
the
female
character
than
the
solidity
of
marble
does
from
its
polish
and
lustre
she
has
such
virtues
as
make
us
value
the
truly
great
of
our
own
sex
she
has
all
the
winning
graces
that
make
us
love
even
the
faults
we
see
in
the
weak
and
beautiful
in
hers
let
us
give
as
a
companion
picture
the
not
less
beautiful
delineation
of
a
husband
that
of
colonel
hutchinson
the
commonwealth
man
by
his
widow
shortly
before
his
death
he
enjoined
her
not
to
grieve
at
the
common
rate
of
desolate
women
and
faithful
to
his
injunction
instead
of
lamenting
his
loss
she
indulged
her
noble
sorrow
in
depicting
her
husband
as
he
had
lived
they
who
dote
on
mortal
excellences
she
says
in
her
introduction
to
the
when
by
the
inevitable
fate
of
all
things
frail
their
adored
idols
are
taken
from
them
may
let
loose
the
winds
of
passion
to
bring
in
a
flood
of
sorrow
whose
ebbing
tides
carry
away
the
dear
memory
of
what
they
have
lost
and
when
comfort
is
essayed
to
such
mourners
commonly
all
objects
are
removed
out
of
their
view
which
may
with
their
remembrance
renew
the
grief
and
in
time
these
remedies
succeed
and
oblivion
curtain
is
by
degrees
drawn
over
the
dead
face
and
things
less
lovely
are
liked
while
they
are
not
viewed
together
with
that
which
was
most
excellent
but
i
that
am
under
a
command
not
to
grieve
at
the
common
rate
of
desolate
women
while
i
am
studying
which
way
to
moderate
my
woe
and
if
it
were
possible
to
augment
my
love
i
can
for
the
present
find
out
none
more
just
to
your
dear
father
nor
consolatory
to
myself
than
the
preservation
of
his
memory
which
i
need
not
gild
with
such
flattering
commendations
as
hired
preachers
do
equally
give
to
the
truly
and
titularly
honourable
a
naked
undressed
narrative
speaking
the
simple
truth
of
him
will
deck
him
with
more
substantial
glory
than
all
the
panegyrics
the
best
pens
could
ever
consecrate
to
the
virtues
of
the
best
men
the
following
is
the
wife
portrait
of
colonel
hutchinson
as
a
husband
for
conjugal
affection
to
his
wife
it
was
such
in
him
as
whosoever
would
draw
out
a
rule
of
honour
kindness
and
religion
to
be
practised
in
that
estate
need
no
more
but
exactly
draw
out
his
example
never
man
had
a
greater
passion
for
a
woman
nor
a
more
honourable
esteem
of
a
wife
yet
he
was
not
uxorious
nor
remitted
he
that
just
rule
which
it
was
her
honour
to
obey
but
managed
the
reins
of
government
with
such
prudence
and
affection
that
she
who
could
not
delight
in
such
an
honourable
and
advantageable
subjection
must
have
wanted
a
reasonable
soul
he
governed
by
persuasion
which
he
never
employed
but
to
things
honourable
and
profitable
to
herself
he
loved
her
soul
and
her
honour
more
than
her
outside
and
yet
he
had
ever
for
her
person
a
constant
indulgence
exceeding
the
common
temporary
passion
of
the
most
uxorious
fools
if
he
esteemed
her
at
a
higher
rate
than
she
in
herself
could
have
deserved
he
was
the
author
of
that
virtue
he
doated
on
while
she
only
reflected
his
own
glories
upon
him
all
that
she
was
was
him
while
he
was
here
and
all
that
she
is
now
at
best
is
but
his
pale
shade
so
liberal
was
he
to
her
and
of
so
generous
a
temper
that
he
hated
the
mention
of
severed
purses
his
estate
being
so
much
at
her
disposal
that
he
never
would
receive
an
account
of
anything
she
expended
so
constant
was
he
in
his
love
that
when
she
ceased
to
be
young
and
lovely
he
began
to
show
most
fondness
he
loved
her
at
such
a
kind
and
generous
rate
as
words
can
not
express
yet
even
this
which
was
the
highest
love
he
or
any
man
could
have
was
bounded
by
a
superior
he
loved
her
in
the
lord
as
his
not
his
idol
but
in
such
a
manner
as
showed
that
an
affection
founded
on
the
just
rules
of
duty
far
exceeds
every
way
all
the
irregular
passions
in
the
world
he
loved
god
above
her
and
all
the
other
dear
pledges
of
his
heart
and
for
his
glory
cheerfully
resigned
them
lady
rachel
russell
is
another
of
the
women
of
history
celebrated
for
her
devotion
and
faithfulness
as
a
wife
she
laboured
and
pleaded
for
her
husband
release
so
long
as
she
could
do
so
with
honour
but
when
she
saw
that
all
was
in
vain
she
collected
her
courage
and
strove
by
her
example
to
strengthen
the
resolution
of
her
dear
lord
and
when
his
last
hour
had
nearly
come
and
his
wife
and
children
waited
to
receive
his
parting
embrace
she
brave
to
the
end
that
she
might
not
add
to
his
distress
concealed
the
agony
of
her
grief
under
a
seeming
composure
and
they
parted
after
a
tender
adieu
in
silence
after
she
had
gone
lord
william
said
now
the
bitterness
of
death
is
passed
we
have
spoken
of
the
influence
of
a
wife
upon
a
man
character
there
are
few
men
strong
enough
to
resist
the
influence
of
a
lower
character
in
a
wife
if
she
do
not
sustain
and
elevate
what
is
highest
in
his
nature
she
will
speedily
reduce
him
to
her
own
level
thus
a
wife
may
be
the
making
or
the
unmaking
of
the
best
of
men
an
illustration
of
this
power
is
furnished
in
the
life
of
bunyan
the
profligate
tinker
had
the
good
fortune
to
marry
in
early
life
a
worthy
young
woman
of
good
parentage
my
mercy
he
himself
says
was
to
light
upon
a
wife
whose
father
and
mother
were
accounted
godly
this
woman
and
i
though
we
came
together
as
poor
as
poor
might
be
having
so
much
household
stuff
as
a
dish
or
a
spoon
betwixt
us
both
yet
she
had
for
her
part
plain
man
pathway
to
heaven
and
practice
of
piety
which
her
father
had
left
her
when
he
died
and
by
reading
these
and
other
good
books
helped
by
the
kindly
influence
of
his
wife
bunyan
was
gradually
reclaimed
from
his
evil
ways
and
led
gently
into
the
paths
of
peace
richard
baxter
the
nonconformist
divine
was
far
advanced
in
life
before
he
met
the
excellent
woman
who
eventually
became
his
wife
he
was
too
laboriously
occupied
in
his
vocation
of
minister
to
have
any
time
to
spare
for
courtship
and
his
marriage
was
as
in
the
case
of
calvin
as
much
a
matter
of
convenience
as
of
love
miss
charlton
the
lady
of
his
choice
was
the
owner
of
property
in
her
own
right
but
lest
it
should
be
thought
that
baxter
married
her
for
covetousness
he
requested
first
that
she
should
give
over
to
her
relatives
the
principal
part
of
her
fortune
and
that
he
should
have
nothing
that
before
her
marriage
was
hers
secondly
that
she
should
so
arrange
her
affairs
as
that
he
might
be
entangled
in
no
lawsuits
and
thirdly
that
she
should
expect
none
of
the
time
that
his
ministerial
work
might
require
these
several
conditions
the
bride
having
complied
with
the
marriage
took
place
and
proved
a
happy
one
we
lived
said
baxter
in
inviolated
love
and
mutual
complacency
sensible
of
the
benefit
of
mutual
help
nearly
nineteen
years
yet
the
life
of
baxter
was
one
of
great
trials
and
troubles
arising
from
the
unsettled
state
of
the
times
in
which
he
lived
he
was
hunted
about
from
one
part
of
the
country
to
another
and
for
several
years
he
had
no
settled
the
women
he
gently
remarks
in
his
have
most
of
that
sort
of
trouble
but
my
wife
easily
bore
it
all
in
the
sixth
year
of
his
marriage
baxter
was
brought
before
the
magistrates
at
brentford
for
holding
a
conventicle
at
acton
and
was
sentenced
by
them
to
be
imprisoned
in
clerkenwell
gaol
there
he
was
joined
by
his
wife
who
affectionately
nursed
him
during
his
confinement
she
was
never
so
cheerful
a
companion
to
me
he
says
as
in
prison
and
was
very
much
against
me
seeking
to
be
released
at
length
he
was
set
at
liberty
by
the
judges
of
the
court
of
common
pleas
to
whom
he
had
appealed
against
the
sentence
of
the
magistrates
at
the
death
of
baxter
after
a
very
troubled
yet
happy
and
cheerful
life
her
husband
left
a
touching
portrait
of
the
graces
virtues
and
christian
character
of
this
excellent
woman
one
of
the
most
charming
things
to
be
found
in
his
works
the
noble
count
zinzendorf
was
united
to
an
equally
noble
woman
who
bore
him
up
through
life
by
her
great
spirit
and
sustained
him
in
all
his
labours
by
her
unfailing
courage
years
experience
has
shown
me
he
said
that
just
the
helpmate
whom
i
have
is
the
only
one
that
could
suit
my
vocation
who
else
could
have
so
carried
through
my
family
affairs
who
lived
so
spotlessly
before
the
world
who
so
wisely
aided
me
in
my
rejection
of
a
dry
morality
who
would
like
she
without
a
murmur
have
seen
her
husband
encounter
such
dangers
by
land
and
sea
who
undertaken
with
him
and
sustained
such
astonishing
pilgrimages
who
amid
such
difficulties
could
have
held
up
her
head
and
supported
me
and
finally
who
of
all
human
beings
could
so
well
understand
and
interpret
to
others
my
inner
and
outer
being
as
this
one
of
such
nobleness
in
her
way
of
thinking
such
great
intellectual
capacity
and
free
from
the
theological
perplexities
that
so
often
enveloped
me
one
of
the
brave
livingstone
greatest
trials
during
his
travels
in
south
africa
was
the
death
of
his
affectionate
wife
who
had
shared
his
dangers
and
accompanied
him
in
so
many
of
his
wanderings
in
communicating
the
intelligence
of
her
decease
at
shupanga
on
the
river
zambesi
to
his
friend
sir
roderick
murchison
livingstone
said
i
must
confess
that
this
heavy
stroke
quite
takes
the
heart
out
of
me
everything
else
that
has
happened
only
made
me
more
determined
to
overcome
all
difficulties
but
after
this
sad
stroke
i
feel
crushed
and
void
of
strength
only
three
short
months
of
her
society
after
four
years
separation
i
married
her
for
love
and
the
longer
i
lived
with
her
i
loved
her
the
more
a
good
wife
and
a
good
brave
kindhearted
mother
was
she
deserving
all
the
praises
you
bestowed
upon
her
at
our
parting
dinner
for
teaching
her
own
and
the
native
children
too
at
kolobeng
i
try
to
bow
to
the
blow
as
from
our
heavenly
father
who
orders
all
things
for
us
i
shall
do
my
duty
still
but
it
is
with
a
darkened
horizon
that
i
again
set
about
it
sir
samuel
romilly
left
behind
him
in
his
autobiography
a
touching
picture
of
his
wife
to
whom
he
attributed
no
small
measure
of
the
success
and
happiness
that
accompanied
him
through
life
for
the
last
fifteen
years
he
said
my
happiness
has
been
the
constant
study
of
the
most
excellent
of
wives
a
woman
in
whom
a
strong
understanding
the
noblest
and
most
elevated
sentiments
and
the
most
courageous
virtue
are
united
to
the
warmest
affection
and
to
the
utmost
delicacy
of
mind
and
heart
and
all
these
intellectual
perfections
are
graced
by
the
most
splendid
beauty
that
human
eyes
ever
beheld
romilly
affection
and
admiration
for
this
noble
woman
endured
to
the
end
and
when
she
died
the
shock
proved
greater
than
his
sensitive
nature
could
bear
sleep
left
his
eyelids
his
mind
became
unhinged
and
three
days
after
her
death
the
sad
event
occurred
which
brought
his
own
valued
life
to
a
close
sir
francis
burdett
to
whom
romilly
had
been
often
politically
opposed
fell
into
such
a
state
of
profound
melancholy
on
the
death
of
his
wife
that
he
persistently
refused
nourishment
of
any
kind
and
died
before
the
removal
of
her
remains
from
the
house
and
husband
and
wife
were
laid
side
by
side
in
the
same
grave
it
was
grief
for
the
loss
of
his
wife
that
sent
sir
thomas
graham
into
the
army
at
the
age
of
every
one
knows
the
picture
of
the
pair
by
gainsborough
one
of
the
most
exquisite
of
that
painter
works
they
lived
happily
together
for
eighteen
years
and
then
she
died
leaving
him
inconsolable
to
forget
his
sorrow
and
as
some
thought
to
get
rid
of
the
weariness
of
his
life
without
her
graham
joined
lord
hood
as
a
volunteer
and
distinguished
himself
by
the
recklessness
of
his
bravery
at
the
siege
of
toulon
he
served
all
through
the
peninsular
war
first
under
sir
john
moore
and
afterwards
under
wellington
rising
through
the
various
grades
of
the
service
until
he
rose
to
be
second
in
command
he
was
commonly
known
as
the
hero
of
barossa
because
of
his
famous
victory
at
that
place
and
he
was
eventually
raised
to
the
peerage
as
lord
lynedoch
ending
his
days
peacefully
at
a
very
advanced
age
but
to
the
last
he
tenderly
cherished
the
memory
of
his
dead
wife
to
the
love
of
whom
he
may
be
said
to
have
owed
all
his
glory
never
said
sheridan
of
him
when
pronouncing
his
eulogy
in
the
house
of
commons
never
was
there
seated
a
loftier
spirit
in
a
braver
heart
and
so
have
noble
wives
cherished
the
memory
of
their
husbands
there
is
a
celebrated
monument
in
vienna
erected
to
the
memory
of
one
of
the
best
generals
of
the
austrian
army
on
which
there
is
an
inscription
setting
forth
his
great
services
during
the
seven
years
war
concluding
with
the
words
non
patria
nec
imperator
sed
conjux
posuit
when
sir
albert
morton
died
his
wife
grief
was
such
that
she
shortly
followed
him
and
was
laid
by
his
side
wotton
two
lines
on
the
event
have
been
celebrated
as
containing
a
volume
in
seventeen
words
he
first
deceased
she
for
a
little
tried
to
live
without
him
liked
it
not
and
died
so
when
washington
wife
was
informed
that
her
dear
lord
had
suffered
his
last
agony
had
drawn
his
last
breath
and
departed
she
said
is
well
all
is
now
over
i
shall
soon
follow
him
i
have
no
more
trials
to
pass
through
not
only
have
women
been
the
best
companions
friends
and
consolers
but
they
have
in
many
cases
been
the
most
effective
helpers
of
their
husbands
in
their
special
lines
of
work
galvani
was
especially
happy
in
his
wife
she
was
the
daughter
of
professor
galeazzi
and
it
is
said
to
have
been
through
her
quick
observation
of
the
circumstance
of
the
leg
of
a
frog
placed
near
an
electrical
machine
becoming
convulsed
when
touched
by
a
knife
that
her
husband
was
first
led
to
investigate
the
science
which
has
since
become
identified
with
his
name
wife
also
was
a
woman
of
real
scientific
ability
who
not
only
shared
in
her
husband
pursuits
but
even
undertook
the
task
of
engraving
the
plates
that
accompanied
his
the
late
buckland
had
another
true
helper
in
his
wife
who
assisted
him
with
her
pen
prepared
and
mended
his
fossils
and
furnished
many
of
the
drawings
and
illustrations
of
his
published
works
notwithstanding
her
devotion
to
her
husband
pursuits
says
her
son
frank
buckland
in
the
preface
to
one
of
his
father
works
she
did
not
neglect
the
education
of
her
children
but
occupied
her
mornings
in
superintending
their
instruction
in
sound
and
useful
knowledge
the
sterling
value
of
her
labours
they
now
in
fully
appreciate
and
feel
most
thankful
that
they
were
blessed
with
so
good
a
mother
a
still
more
remarkable
instance
of
helpfulness
in
a
wife
is
presented
in
the
case
of
huber
the
geneva
naturalist
huber
was
blind
from
his
seventeenth
year
and
yet
he
found
means
to
study
and
master
a
branch
of
natural
history
demanding
the
closest
observation
and
the
keenest
eyesight
it
was
through
the
eyes
of
his
wife
that
his
mind
worked
as
if
they
had
been
his
own
she
encouraged
her
husband
studies
as
a
means
of
alleviating
his
privation
which
at
length
he
came
to
forget
and
his
life
was
as
prolonged
and
happy
as
is
usual
with
most
naturalists
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
declare
that
he
should
be
miserable
were
he
to
regain
his
eyesight
i
should
not
know
he
said
to
what
extent
a
person
in
my
situation
could
be
beloved
besides
to
me
my
wife
is
always
young
fresh
and
pretty
which
is
no
light
matter
great
work
on
is
still
regarded
as
a
masterpiece
embodying
a
vast
amount
of
original
observation
on
their
habits
and
natural
history
indeed
while
reading
his
descriptions
one
would
suppose
that
they
were
the
work
of
a
singularly
keensighted
man
rather
than
of
one
who
had
been
entirely
blind
for
years
at
the
time
at
which
he
wrote
them
not
less
touching
was
the
devotion
of
lady
hamilton
to
the
service
of
her
husband
the
late
sir
william
hamilton
professor
of
logic
and
metaphysics
in
the
university
of
edinburgh
after
he
had
been
stricken
by
paralysis
through
overwork
at
the
age
of
she
became
hands
eyes
mind
and
everything
to
him
she
identified
herself
with
his
work
read
and
consulted
books
for
him
copied
out
and
corrected
his
lectures
and
relieved
him
of
all
business
which
she
felt
herself
competent
to
undertake
indeed
her
conduct
as
a
wife
was
nothing
short
of
heroic
and
it
is
probable
that
but
for
her
devoted
and
more
than
wifely
help
and
her
rare
practical
ability
the
greatest
of
her
husband
works
would
never
have
seen
the
light
he
was
by
nature
unmethodical
and
disorderly
and
she
supplied
him
with
method
and
orderliness
his
temperament
was
studious
but
indolent
while
she
was
active
and
energetic
she
abounded
in
the
qualities
which
he
most
lacked
he
had
the
genius
to
which
her
vigorous
nature
gave
the
force
and
impulse
when
sir
william
hamilton
was
elected
to
his
professorship
after
a
severe
and
even
bitter
contest
his
opponents
professing
to
regard
him
as
a
visionary
predicted
that
he
could
never
teach
a
class
of
students
and
that
his
appointment
would
prove
a
total
failure
he
determined
with
the
help
of
his
wife
to
justify
the
choice
of
his
supporters
and
to
prove
that
his
enemies
were
false
prophets
having
no
stock
of
lectures
on
hand
each
lecture
of
the
first
course
was
written
out
day
by
day
as
it
was
to
be
delivered
on
the
following
morning
his
wife
sat
up
with
him
night
after
night
to
write
out
a
fair
copy
of
the
lectures
from
the
rough
sheets
which
he
drafted
in
the
adjoining
room
on
some
occasions
says
his
biographer
the
subject
of
the
lectures
would
prove
less
easily
managed
than
on
others
and
then
sir
william
would
be
found
writing
as
late
as
nine
in
the
morning
while
his
faithful
but
wearied
amanuensis
had
fallen
asleep
on
a
sofa
sometimes
the
finishing
touches
to
the
lecture
were
left
to
be
given
just
before
the
thus
helped
sir
william
completed
his
course
his
reputation
as
a
lecturer
was
established
and
he
eventually
became
recognised
throughout
europe
as
one
of
the
leading
intellects
of
his
time
the
woman
who
soothes
anxiety
by
her
presence
who
charms
and
allays
irritability
by
her
sweetness
of
temper
is
a
consoler
as
well
as
a
true
helper
niebuhr
always
spoke
of
his
wife
as
a
with
him
in
this
sense
without
the
peace
and
consolation
which
be
found
in
her
society
his
nature
would
have
fretted
in
comparative
uselessness
her
sweetness
of
temper
and
her
love
said
he
raise
me
above
the
earth
and
in
a
manner
separate
me
from
this
life
but
she
was
a
helper
in
another
and
more
direct
way
niebuhr
was
accustomed
to
discuss
with
his
wife
every
historical
discovery
every
political
event
every
novelty
in
literature
and
it
was
mainly
for
her
pleasure
and
approbation
in
the
first
instance
that
he
laboured
while
preparing
himself
for
the
instruction
of
the
world
at
large
the
wife
of
john
stuart
mill
was
another
worthy
helper
of
her
husband
though
in
a
more
abstruse
department
of
study
as
we
learn
from
his
touching
dedication
of
the
treatise
liberty
to
the
beloved
and
deplored
memory
of
her
who
was
the
inspirer
and
in
part
the
author
of
all
that
is
best
in
my
writings
the
friend
and
wife
whose
exalted
sense
of
truth
and
right
was
my
strongest
incitement
and
whose
approbation
was
my
chief
reward
i
dedicate
this
volume
not
less
touching
is
the
testimony
borne
by
another
great
living
writer
to
the
character
of
his
wife
in
the
inscription
upon
the
tombstone
of
carlyle
in
haddington
churchyard
where
are
inscribed
these
words
in
her
bright
existence
she
had
more
sorrows
than
are
common
but
also
a
soft
amiability
a
capacity
of
discernment
and
a
noble
loyalty
of
heart
which
are
rare
for
forty
years
she
was
the
true
and
loving
helpmate
of
her
husband
and
by
act
and
word
unweariedly
forwarded
him
as
none
else
could
in
all
of
worthy
that
he
did
or
attempted
the
married
life
of
faraday
was
eminently
happy
in
his
wife
he
found
at
the
same
time
a
true
helpmate
and
she
supported
cheered
and
strengthened
him
on
his
way
through
life
giving
him
the
clear
contentment
of
a
heart
at
ease
in
his
diary
he
speaks
of
his
marriage
as
a
source
of
honour
and
happiness
far
exceeding
all
the
rest
after
twentyeight
years
experience
he
spoke
of
it
as
an
event
which
more
than
any
other
had
contributed
to
his
earthly
happiness
and
healthy
state
of
mind
the
union
he
has
in
nowise
changed
except
only
in
the
depth
and
strength
of
its
character
and
for
years
did
the
union
continue
unbroken
the
love
of
the
old
man
remaining
as
fresh
as
earnest
as
as
in
the
days
of
his
impetuous
youth
in
this
case
marriage
was
as
a
golden
chain
let
down
from
heaven
whose
links
are
bright
and
even
that
falls
like
sleep
on
lovers
and
combines
the
soft
and
sweetest
minds
in
equal
knots
besides
being
a
helper
woman
is
emphatically
a
consoler
her
sympathy
is
unfailing
she
soothes
cheers
and
comforts
never
was
this
more
true
than
in
the
case
of
the
wife
of
tom
hood
whose
tender
devotion
to
him
during
a
life
that
was
a
prolonged
illness
is
one
of
the
most
affecting
things
in
biography
a
woman
of
excellent
good
sense
she
appreciated
her
husband
genius
and
by
encouragement
and
sympathy
cheered
and
heartened
him
to
renewed
effort
in
many
a
weary
struggle
for
life
she
created
about
him
an
atmosphere
of
hope
and
cheerfulness
and
nowhere
did
the
sunshine
of
her
love
seem
so
bright
as
when
lighting
up
the
couch
of
her
invalid
husband
nor
was
he
unconscious
of
her
worth
in
one
of
his
letters
to
her
when
absent
from
his
side
hood
said
i
never
was
anything
dearest
till
i
knew
you
and
i
have
been
a
better
happier
and
more
prosperous
man
ever
since
lay
by
that
truth
in
lavender
sweetest
and
remind
me
of
it
when
i
fail
i
am
writing
warmly
and
fondly
but
not
without
good
cause
first
your
own
affectionate
letter
lately
received
next
the
remembrance
of
our
dear
children
pledges
what
darling
ones
of
our
old
familiar
love
then
a
delicious
impulse
to
pour
out
the
overflowings
of
my
heart
into
yours
and
last
not
least
the
knowledge
that
your
dear
eyes
will
read
what
my
hand
is
now
writing
perhaps
there
is
an
afterthought
that
whatever
may
befall
me
the
wife
of
my
bosom
will
have
the
acknowledgment
of
her
tenderness
worth
excellence
all
that
is
wifely
or
womanly
from
my
pen
in
another
letter
also
written
to
his
wife
during
a
brief
absence
there
is
a
natural
touch
showing
his
deep
affection
for
her
i
went
and
retraced
our
walk
in
the
park
and
sat
down
on
the
same
seat
and
felt
happier
and
better
but
not
only
was
mrs
hood
a
consoler
she
was
also
a
helper
of
her
husband
in
his
special
work
he
had
such
confidence
in
her
judgment
that
he
read
and
and
corrected
with
her
assistance
all
that
he
wrote
many
of
his
pieces
were
first
dedicated
to
her
and
her
ready
memory
often
supplied
him
with
the
necessary
references
and
quotations
thus
in
the
roll
of
noble
wives
of
men
of
genius
mrs
hood
will
always
be
entitled
to
take
a
foremost
place
not
less
effective
as
a
literary
helper
was
lady
napier
the
wife
of
sir
william
napier
historian
of
the
peninsular
war
she
encouraged
him
to
undertake
the
work
and
without
her
help
he
would
have
experienced
great
difficulty
in
completing
it
she
translated
and
epitomized
the
immense
mass
of
original
documents
many
of
them
in
cipher
on
which
it
was
in
a
great
measure
founded
when
the
duke
of
wellington
was
told
of
the
art
and
industry
she
had
displayed
in
deciphering
king
joseph
portfolio
and
the
immense
mass
of
correspondence
taken
at
vittoria
he
at
first
would
hardly
believe
it
adding
i
would
have
given
to
any
person
who
could
have
done
this
for
me
in
the
peninsula
sir
william
napier
handwriting
being
almost
illegible
lady
napier
made
out
his
rough
interlined
manuscript
which
he
himself
could
scarcely
read
and
wrote
out
a
full
fair
copy
for
the
printer
and
all
this
vast
labour
she
undertook
and
accomplished
according
to
the
testimony
of
her
husband
without
having
for
a
moment
neglected
the
care
and
education
of
a
large
family
when
sir
william
lay
on
his
deathbed
lady
napier
was
at
the
same
time
dangerously
ill
but
she
was
wheeled
into
his
room
on
a
sofa
and
the
two
took
their
silent
farewell
of
each
other
the
husband
died
first
in
a
few
weeks
the
wife
followed
him
and
they
sleep
side
by
side
in
the
same
grave
many
other
similar
truehearted
wives
rise
up
in
the
memory
to
recite
whose
praises
would
more
than
fill
up
our
remaining
space
such
as
flaxman
wife
ann
denham
who
cheered
and
encouraged
her
husband
through
life
in
the
prosecution
of
his
art
accompanying
him
to
rome
sharing
in
his
labours
and
anxieties
and
finally
in
his
triumphs
and
to
whom
flaxman
in
the
fortieth
year
of
their
married
life
dedicated
his
beautiful
designs
illustrative
of
faith
hope
and
charity
in
token
of
his
deep
and
undimmed
affection
such
as
katherine
boutcher
kate
the
wife
of
william
blake
who
believed
her
husband
to
be
the
first
genius
on
earth
worked
off
the
impressions
of
his
plates
and
coloured
them
beautifully
with
her
own
hand
bore
with
him
in
all
his
erratic
ways
sympathised
with
him
in
his
sorrows
and
joys
for
years
and
comforted
him
until
his
dying
hour
his
last
sketch
made
in
his
year
being
a
likeness
of
himself
before
making
which
seeing
his
wife
crying
by
his
side
he
said
stay
kate
just
keep
as
you
are
i
will
draw
your
portrait
for
you
have
ever
been
an
angel
to
me
such
again
as
lady
franklin
the
true
and
noble
woman
who
never
rested
in
her
endeavours
to
penetrate
the
secret
of
the
polar
sea
and
prosecute
the
search
for
her
husband
undaunted
by
failure
and
persevering
in
her
determination
with
a
devotion
and
singleness
of
purpose
altogether
unparalleled
or
such
again
as
the
wife
of
zimmermann
whose
intense
melancholy
she
strove
in
vain
to
assuage
sympathizing
with
him
listening
to
him
and
endeavouring
to
understand
him
and
to
whom
when
on
her
deathbed

wives
have
actively
helped
their
husbands
in
other
ways
before
weinsberg
surrendered
to
its
besiegers
the
women
of
the
place
asked
permission
of
the
captors
to
remove
their
valuables
the
permission
was
granted
and
shortly
after
the
women
were
seen
issuing
from
the
gates
carrying
their
husbands
on
their
shoulders
lord
nithsdale
owed
his
escape
from
prison
to
the
address
of
his
wife
who
changed
garments
with
him
sending
him
forth
in
her
stead
and
herself
remaining
prisoner
an
example
which
was
successfully
repeated
by
madame
de
lavalette
but
the
most
remarkable
instance
of
the
release
of
a
husband
through
the
devotion
of
a
wife
was
that
of
the
celebrated
grotius
he
had
lain
for
nearly
twenty
months
in
the
strong
fortress
of
loevestein
near
gorcum
having
been
condemned
by
the
government
of
the
united
provinces
to
perpetual
imprisonment
his
wife
having
been
allowed
to
share
his
cell
greatly
relieved
his
solitude
she
was
permitted
to
go
into
the
town
twice
a
week
and
bring
her
husband
books
of
which
he
required
a
large
number
to
enable
him
to
prosecute
his
studies
at
length
a
large
chest
was
required
to
hold
them
this
the
sentries
at
first
examined
with
great
strictness
but
finding
that
it
only
contained
books
others
arminian
books
and
linen
they
at
length
gave
up
the
search
and
it
was
allowed
to
pass
out
and
in
as
a
matter
of
course
this
led
grotius
wife
to
conceive
the
idea
of
releasing
him
and
she
persuaded
him
one
day
to
deposit
himself
in
the
chest
instead
of
the
outgoing
books
when
the
two
soldiers
appointed
to
remove
it
took
it
up
they
felt
it
to
be
considerably
heavier
than
usual
and
one
of
them
asked
jestingly
have
we
got
the
arminian
himself
here
to
which
the
wife
replied
yes
perhaps
some
arminian
books
the
chest
reached
gorcum
in
safety
the
captive
was
released
and
grotius
escaped
across
the
frontier
into
brabant
and
afterwards
into
france
where
he
was
rejoined
by
his
wife
trial
and
suffering
are
the
tests
of
married
life
they
bring
out
the
real
character
and
often
tend
to
produce
the
closest
union
they
may
even
be
the
spring
of
the
purest
happiness
uninterrupted
joy
like
uninterrupted
success
is
not
good
for
either
man
or
woman
when
wife
died
he
began
to
reflect
upon
the
loss
he
had
sustained
they
had
both
known
poverty
and
struggled
through
it
and
it
was
his
greatest
sorrow
that
she
was
taken
from
him
at
the
moment
when
fortune
was
beginning
to
smile
upon
him
but
too
late
for
her
to
share
in
his
prosperity
alas
i
said
he
amongst
my
griefs
must
i
reckon
even
her
love
the
strongest
truest
that
ever
inspired
the
heart
of
woman
which
made
me
the
happiest
of
mortals
and
yet
was
to
me
a
fountain
of
a
thousand
distresses
inquietudes
and
cares
to
entire
cheerfulness
perhaps
she
never
attained
but
for
what
unspeakable
sweetness
what
exalted
enrapturing
joys
is
not
love
indebted
to
sorrow
amidst
growing
anxieties
with
the
torture
of
anguish
in
my
heart
i
have
been
made
even
by
the
loss
which
caused
me
this
anguish
and
these
anxieties
inexpressibly
happy
when
tears
flowed
over
our
cheeks
did
not
a
nameless
delight
stream
through
my
breast
oppressed
equally
by
joy
and
sorrow
there
is
a
degree
of
sentiment
in
german
love
which
seems
strange
to
english
readers
such
as
we
find
depicted
in
the
lives
of
novalis
jung
stilling
fichte
jean
paul
and
others
that
might
be
named
the
german
betrothal
is
a
ceremony
of
almost
equal
importance
to
the
marriage
itself
and
in
that
state
the
sentiments
are
allowed
free
play
whilst
english
lovers
are
restrained
shy
and
as
if
ashamed
of
their
feelings
take
for
instance
the
case
of
herder
whom
his
future
wife
first
saw
in
the
pulpit
i
heard
she
says
the
voice
of
an
angel
and
words
such
as
i
had
never
heard
before
in
the
afternoon
i
saw
him
and
stammered
out
my
thanks
to
him
from
this
time
forth
our
souls
were
one
they
were
betrothed
long
before
their
means
would
permit
them
to
marry
but
at
length
they
were
united
we
were
married
says
caroline
the
wife
by
the
of
a
beautiful
evening
we
were
one
heart
one
soul
herder
was
equally
ecstatic
in
his
language
i
have
a
wife
he
wrote
to
jacobi
that
is
the
tree
the
consolation
and
the
happiness
of
my
life
even
in
flying
transient
thoughts
often
surprise
us
we
are
one
take
again
the
case
of
fichte
in
whose
history
his
courtship
and
marriage
form
a
beautiful
episode
he
was
a
poor
german
student
living
with
a
family
at
zurich
in
the
capacity
of
tutor
when
he
first
made
the
acquaintance
of
johanna
maria
hahn
a
niece
of
klopstock
her
position
in
life
was
higher
than
that
of
fichte
nevertheless
she
regarded
him
with
sincere
admiration
when
fichte
was
about
to
leave
zurich
his
troth
plighted
to
her
she
knowing
him
to
be
very
poor
offered
him
a
gift
of
money
before
setting
out
he
was
inexpressibly
hurt
by
the
offer
and
at
first
even
doubted
whether
she
could
really
love
him
but
on
second
thoughts
he
wrote
to
her
expressing
his
deep
thanks
but
at
the
same
time
the
impossibility
of
his
accepting
such
a
gift
from
her
he
succeeded
in
reaching
his
destination
though
entirely
destitute
of
means
after
a
long
and
hard
struggle
with
the
world
extending
over
many
years
fichte
was
at
length
earning
money
enough
to
enable
him
to
marry
in
one
of
his
charming
letters
to
his
betrothed
he
said
and
so
dearest
i
solemnly
devote
myself
to
thee
and
thank
thee
that
thou
hast
thought
me
not
unworthy
to
be
thy
companion
on
the
journey
of
life
there
is
no
land
of
happiness
here
below
i
know
it
now
but
a
land
of
toil
where
every
joy
but
strengthens
us
for
greater
labour
we
shall
traverse
it
and
encourage
and
strengthen
each
other
until
our
spirits
oh
may
it
be
together
shall
rise
to
the
eternal
fountain
of
all
peace
the
married
life
of
fichte
was
very
happy
his
wife
proved
a
true
and
highminded
helpmate
during
the
war
of
liberation
she
was
assiduous
in
her
attention
to
the
wounded
in
the
hospitals
where
she
caught
a
malignant
fever
which
nearly
carried
her
off
fichte
himself
caught
the
same
disease
and
was
for
a
time
completely
prostrated
but
he
lived
for
a
few
more
years
and
died
at
the
early
age
of
consumed
by
his
own
fire
what
a
contrast
does
the
courtship
and
married
life
of
the
blunt
and
practical
william
cobbett
present
to
the
aesthetical
and
sentimental
love
of
these
highly
refined
germans
not
less
honest
not
less
true
but
as
some
would
think
comparatively
coarse
and
vulgar
when
he
first
set
eyes
upon
the
girl
that
was
afterwards
to
become
his
wife
she
was
only
thirteen
years
old
and
he
was
a
in
a
foot
regiment
stationed
at
john
in
new
brunswick
he
was
passing
the
door
of
her
father
house
one
day
in
winter
and
saw
the
girl
out
in
the
snow
scrubbing
a
he
said
at
once
to
himself
that
the
girl
for
me
he
made
her
acquaintance
and
resolved
that
she
should
be
his
wife
so
soon
as
he
could
get
discharged
from
the
army
on
the
eve
of
the
girl
return
to
woolwich
with
her
father
who
was
a
in
the
artillery
cobbett
sent
her
a
hundred
and
fifty
guineas
which
he
had
saved
in
order
that
she
might
be
able
to
live
without
hard
work
until
his
return
to
england
the
girl
departed
taking
with
her
the
money
and
five
years
later
cobbett
obtained
his
discharge
on
reaching
london
he
made
haste
to
call
upon
the
daughter
i
found
he
says
my
little
girl
a
hard
work
it
was
at
five
pounds
a
year
in
the
house
of
a
captain
brisac
and
without
hardly
saying
a
word
about
the
matter
she
put
into
my
hands
the
whole
of
my
hundred
and
fifty
guineas
unbroken
admiration
of
her
conduct
was
now
added
to
love
of
her
person
and
cobbett
shortly
after
married
the
girl
who
proved
an
excellent
wife
he
was
indeed
never
tired
of
speaking
her
praises
and
it
was
his
pride
to
attribute
to
her
all
the
comfort
and
much
of
the
success
of
his
though
cobbett
was
regarded
by
many
in
his
lifetime
as
a
coarse
hard
practical
man
full
of
prejudices
there
was
yet
a
strong
undercurrent
of
poetry
in
his
nature
and
while
he
declaimed
against
sentiment
there
were
few
men
more
thoroughly
imbued
with
sentiment
of
the
best
kind
he
had
the
tenderest
regard
for
the
character
of
woman
he
respected
her
purity
and
her
virtue
and
in
his
to
young
men
he
has
painted
the
true
womanly
woman
the
helpful
cheerful
affectionate
wife
with
a
vividness
and
brightness
and
at
the
same
time
a
force
of
good
sense
that
has
never
been
surpassed
by
any
english
writer
cobbett
was
anything
but
refined
in
the
conventional
sense
of
the
word
but
he
was
pure
temperate
industrious
vigorous
and
energetic
in
an
eminent
degree
many
of
his
views
were
no
doubt
wrong
but
they
were
his
own
for
he
insisted
on
thinking
for
himself
in
everything
though
few
men
took
a
firmer
grasp
of
the
real
than
he
did
perhaps
still
fewer
were
more
swayed
by
the
ideal
in
of
his
own
emotions
he
is
unsurpassed
indeed
cobbett
might
almost
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
greatest
prose
poets
of
english
real
life

it
is
there
that
we
find
our
chief
sphere

that
we

that
we
educate
ourselves
in

shape

there
we

the
difficulties
trials

which
according
as
we
deal
with
them
give
a
colour
to
our
entire
and
there
too
we
become
subject
to
the
great
discipline
of
suffering
from
which
we
learn
far
more
than
from
the
safe
seclusion
of
the

the

also

to
enable
a
man
to

it

only
by
mixing
freely
in
the
world
that
one
can
form
a
proper
estimate
of
his
own
capacity
without
such
experience
one
is
apt
to
become
conceited
and
arrogant
at
all
events
he
will
remain
ignorant
of
himself

he
may
heretofore
have

no

said

uncontroverted
truth
that
no

made

who
understood

one
who
mistook
them

persons
however
are
readier
to
take
measure
of
the
capacity
of
others
than
of
themselves

to
me
said
a
certain
tronchin
of
geneva
speaking
of
rousseau
bring
him
to
me
that
i
may
see
whether
he
has
got
anything
in
him
the
probability
being
that
rousseau
who
knew
himself
better
was
much
more
likely
to
take
measure
of
tronchin
than
tronchin
was
to
take
measure
of
him
a
due
amount
of

therefore
necessary
for
those
who
would
be
anything

do
anything

frederic
perthes
once
said
to
a
young
friend
you
know
only
too
well
what
you
can
do
but
till
you
have
learned
what
you
can
not
do
you
will
neither
accomplish
anything
of
moment
nor
know
inward
peace
any
one
who
would
profit
by
experience
will
never
be
above
asking
for
help
he
who
thinks
himself
already
too
wise
to
learn
of
others
will
never
succeed
in
doing
anything
either
good
or
great
we
have
to
keep
our
minds
and
hearts
open
and
never
be
ashamed
to
learn
with
the
assistance
of
those
who
are
wiser
and
more
experienced
than
ourselves
the
man
made
wise
by
experience
endeavours
to
judge
correctly
of
the
thugs
which
come
under
his
observation
and
form
the
subject
of
his
daily
life
what
we
call
common

is
for
the
most
part

the
result
of

to
acquire

the
most
sensible
people
to
be
met
with
are
intelligent
men
of
business
and
of
the
world
who
argue
from
what
they
see
and
know
instead
of
spinning
cobweb
distinctions
of
what
things
ought
to
be
for
the

often
display
more
good
sense
than
men

fewer
pretensions

judging
of
things
naturally
by
the
involuntary
impression
they
make
on
the
mind
their
intuitive
powers
are
quicker
their
perceptions
more
acute
their
sympathies
more
lively
and
their
manners
more
adaptive
to
particular
ends

their
greater
tact

displayed
in

to
control

the
whole
of
life
may
be
regarded
as
a
great
school
of
experience
in
which
men
and
women
are
the
pupils
as
in
a
school
many
of
the
lessons
learnt
there
must
needs
be
taken
on
trust
we
may
not
understand
them
and
may
possibly
think
it
hard
that
we
have
to
learn
them
especially
where
the
teachers
are
trials
sorrows
temptations
and
difficulties
and
yet
we
must
not
only
accept
their
lessons
but
recognise
them
as
being
divinely
appointed

what
extent
have
the
pupils
profited
by
their

in
growth
of
wisdom
courage
have
they
preserved
their
integrity
amidst
prosperity
and
enjoyed
life
in
temperance
and
moderation
or
has
life
been
with
them
a
mere
feast
of
selfishness
without
care
or
thought
for
others
what
have
they
learnt
from
trial
and
adversity
have
they
learnt
patience
submission
and
trust
in
god
or
have
they
learnt
nothing
but
impatience
querulousness
and
discontent
the
results
of
experience
are
of
course
only
to
be
achieved
by
living
and
living
is
a
question
of
time
the
man
of
experience
learns
to
rely
upon
time
as
his
helper
time
and
i
against
any
two
was
a
maxim
of
cardinal
mazarin
time
has
been
described
as
a
beautifier
and
as
a
consoler
but
it
is
also
a
teacher
it
is
the
food
of
experience
the
soil
of
wisdom
it
may
be
the
friend
or
the
enemy
of
youth
and
time
will
sit
beside
the
old
as
a
consoler
or
as
a
tormentor
according
as
it
has
been
used
or
misused
and
the
past
life
has
been
well
or
ill
spent
time
says
george
herbert
is
the
rider
that
breaks
youth
to
the
young
how
bright
the
new
world
looks
how
full
of
novelty
of
enjoyment
of
pleasure
but
as
years
pass
we
find
the
world
to
be
a
place
of
sorrow
as
well
as
of
joy
as
we
proceed
through
life
many
dark
vistas
open
upon
us
of
toil
suffering
difficulty
perhaps
misfortune
and
failure
happy
they
who
can
pass
through
and
amidst
such
trials
with
a
firm
mind
and
pure
heart
encountering
trials
with
cheerfulness
and
standing
erect
beneath
even
the
heaviest
burden
a
little
youthful
ardour
is
a
great
help
in
life
and
is
useful
as
an
energetic
motive
power
it
is
gradually
cooled
down
by
time
no
matter
how
glowing
it
has
been
while
it
is
trained
and
subdued
by
experience
but
it
is
a
healthy
and
hopeful
indication
of
character
to
be
encouraged
in
a
right
direction
and
not
to
be
sneered
down
and
repressed
it
is
a
sign
of
a
vigorous
unselfish
nature
as
egotism
is
of
a
narrow
and
selfish
one
and
to
begin
life
with
egotism
and
is
fatal
to
all
breadth
and
vigour
of
character
life
in
such
a
case
would
be
like
a
year
in
which
there
was
no
spring
without
a
generous
seedtime
there
will
be
an
unflowering
summer
and
an
unproductive
harvest
and
youth
is
the
springtime
of
life
in
which
if
there
be
not
a
fair
share
of
enthusiasm
little
will
be
attempted
and
still
less
done
it
also
considerably
helps
the
working
quality
inspiring
confidence
and
hope
and
carrying
one
through
the
dry
details
of
business
and
duty
with
cheerfulness
and
joy
it
is
the
due
admixture
of
romance
and
reality
said
sir
henry
lawrence
that
best
carries
a
man
through
life
the
quality
of
romance
or
enthusiasm
is
to
be
valued
as
an
energy
imparted
to
the
human
mind
to
prompt
and
sustain
its
noblest
efforts
sir
henry
always
urged
upon
young
men
not
that
they
should
repress
enthusiasm
but
sedulously
cultivate
and
direct
the
feeling
as
one
implanted
for
wise
and
noble
purposes
when
the
two
faculties
of
romance
and
reality
he
said
are
duly
blended
reality
pursues
a
straight
rough
path
to
a
desirable
and
practicable
result
while
romance
beguiles
the
road
by
pointing
out
its
beauties
by
bestowing
a
deep
and
practical
conviction
that
even
in
this
dark
and
material
existence
there
may
be
found
a
joy
with
which
a
stranger
intermeddleth
not
a
light
that
shineth
more
and
more
unto
the
perfect
day
it
was
characteristic
of
joseph
lancaster
when
a
boy
of
only
fourteen
years
of
age
after
reading
on
the
slave
trade
to
form
the
resolution
of
leaving
his
home
and
going
out
to
the
west
indies
to
teach
the
poor
blacks
to
read
the
bible
and
he
actually
set
out
with
a
bible
and
progress
in
his
bundle
and
only
a
few
shillings
in
his
purse
he
even
succeeded
in
reaching
the
west
indies
doubtless
very
much
at
a
loss
how
to
set
about
his
proposed
work
but
in
the
meantime
his
distressed
parents
having
discovered
whither
he
had
gone
had
him
speedily
brought
back
yet
with
his
enthusiasm
unabated
and
from
that
time
forward
he
unceasingly
devoted
himself
to
the
truly
philanthropic
work
of
educating
the
destitute
poor
there
needs
all
the
force
that
enthusiasm
can
give
to
enable
a
man
to
succeed
in
any
great
enterprise
of
life
without
it
the
obstruction
and
difficulty
he
has
to
encounter
on
every
side
might
compel
him
to
succumb
but
with
courage
and
perseverance
inspired
by
enthusiasm
a
man
feels
strong
enough
to
face
any
danger
to
grapple
with
any
difficulty
what
an
enthusiasm
was
that
of
columbus
who
believing
in
the
existence
of
a
new
world
braved
the
dangers
of
unknown
seas
and
when
those
about
him
despaired
and
rose
up
against
him
threatening
to
cast
him
into
the
sea
still
stood
firm
upon
his
hope
and
courage
until
the
great
new
world
at
length
rose
upon
the
horizon
the
brave
man
will
not
be
baffled
but
tries
and
tries
again
until
he
succeeds
the
tree
does
not
fall
at
the
first
stroke
but
only
by
repeated
strokes
and
after
great
labour
we
may
see
the
visible
success
at
which
a
man
has
arrived
but
forget
the
toil
and
suffering
and
peril
through
which
it
has
been
achieved
when
a
friend
of
marshal
lefevre
was
complimenting
him
on
his
possessions
and
good
fortune
the
marshal
said
you
envy
me
do
you
well
you
shall
have
these
things
at
a
better
bargain
than
i
had
come
into
the
court
i
fire
at
you
with
a
gun
twenty
times
at
thirty
paces
and
if
i
do
kill
you
all
shall
be
your
own
what
you
wo
very
well
recollect
then
that
i
have
been
shot
at
more
than
a
thousand
times
and
much
nearer
before
i
arrived
at
the
state
in
which
you
now
find
me
the
apprenticeship
of
difficulty
is
one
which
the
greatest
of
men
have
had
to
serve
it
is
usually
the
best
stimulus
and
discipline
of
character
it
often
evokes
powers
of
action
that
but
for
it
would
have
remained
dormant
as
comets
are
sometimes
revealed
by
eclipses
so
heroes
are
brought
to
light
by
sudden
calamity
it
seems
as
if
in
certain
cases
genius
like
iron
struck
by
the
flint
needed
the
sharp
and
sudden
blow
of
adversity
to
bring
out
the
divine
spark
there
are
natures
which
blossom
and
ripen
amidst
trials
which
would
only
wither
and
decay
in
an
atmosphere
of
ease
and
comfort
thus
it
is
good
for
men
to
be
roused
into
action
and
stiffened
into
by
difficulty
rather
than
to
slumber
away
their
lives
in
useless
apathy
and
indolence
it
is
the
struggle
that
is
the
condition
of
victory
if
there
were
no
difficulties
there
would
be
no
need
of
efforts
if
there
were
no
temptations
there
would
be
no
training
in
and
but
little
merit
in
virtue
if
there
were
no
trial
and
suffering
there
would
be
no
education
in
patience
and
resignation
thus
difficulty
adversity
and
suffering
are
not
all
evil
but
often
the
best
source
of
strength
discipline
and
virtue
for
the
same
reason
it
is
often
of
advantage
for
a
man
to
be
under
the
necessity
of
having
to
struggle
with
poverty
and
conquer
it
he
who
has
battled
says
carlyle
were
it
only
with
poverty
and
hard
toil
will
be
found
stronger
and
more
expert
than
he
who
could
stay
at
home
from
the
battle
concealed
among
the
provision
waggons
or
even
rest
unwatchfully
by
the
stuff
scholars
have
found
poverty
tolerable
compared
with
the
privation
of
intellectual
food
riches
weigh
much
more
heavily
upon
the
mind
i
can
not
but
choose
say
to
poverty
said
richter
be
welcome
so
that
thou
come
not
too
late
in
life
poverty
horace
tells
us
drove
him
to
poetry
and
poetry
introduced
him
to
varus
and
virgil
and
maecenas
obstacles
says
michelet
are
great
incentives
i
lived
for
whole
years
upon
a
virgil
and
found
myself
well
off
an
odd
volume
of
racine
purchased
by
chance
at
a
stall
on
the
quay
created
the
poet
of
toulon
the
spaniards
are
even
said
to
have
meanly
rejoiced
the
poverty
of
cervantes
but
for
which
they
supposed
the
production
of
his
great
works
might
have
been
prevented
when
the
archbishop
of
toledo
visited
the
french
ambassador
at
madrid
the
gentlemen
in
the
suite
of
the
latter
expressed
their
high
admiration
of
the
writings
of
the
author
of
quixote
and
intimated
their
desire
of
becoming
acquainted
with
one
who
had
given
them
so
much
pleasure
the
answer
they
received
was
that
cervantes
had
borne
arms
in
the
service
of
his
country
and
was
now
old
and
poor
what
exclaimed
one
of
the
frenchmen
is
not
senor
cervantes
in
good
circumstances
why
is
he
not
maintained
then
out
of
the
public
treasury
heaven
forbid
was
the
reply
that
his
necessities
should
be
ever
relieved
if
it
is
those
which
make
him
write
since
it
is
his
poverty
that
makes
the
world
rich
it
is
not
prosperity
so
much
as
adversity
not
wealth
so
much
as
poverty
that
stimulates
the
perseverance
of
strong
and
healthy
natures
rouses
their
energy
and
developes
their
character
burke
said
of
himself
i
was
not
rocked
and
swaddled
and
dandled
into
a
legislator
in
adversum
is
the
motto
for
a
man
like
you
some
men
only
require
a
great
difficulty
set
in
their
way
to
exhibit
the
force
of
their
character
and
genius
and
that
difficulty
once
conquered
becomes
one
of
the
greatest
incentives
to
their
further
progress
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
men
succeed
through
success
they
much
oftener
succeed
through
failure
by
far
the
best
experience
of
men
is
made
up
of
their
remembered
failures
in
dealing
with
others
in
the
affairs
of
life
such
failures
in
sensible
men
incite
to
better
and
greater
tact
and
as
a
means
of
avoiding
them
in
the
future
ask
the
diplomatist
and
he
will
tell
you
that
he
has
learned
his
art
through
being
baffled
defeated
thwarted
and
circumvented
far
more
than
from
having
succeeded
precept
study
advice
and
example
could
never
have
taught
them
so
well
as
failure
has
done
it
has
disciplined
them
experimentally
and
taught
them
what
to
do
as
well
as
what
not
to
do
which
is
often
still
more
important
in
diplomacy
many
have
to
make
up
their
minds
to
encounter
failure
again
and
again
before
they
succeed
but
if
they
have
pluck
the
failure
will
only
serve
to
rouse
their
courage
and
stimulate
them
to
renewed
efforts
talma
the
greatest
of
actors
was
hissed
off
the
stage
when
he
first
appeared
on
it
lacordaire
one
of
the
greatest
preachers
of
modern
times
only
acquired
celebrity
after
repeated
failures
montalembert
said
of
his
first
public
appearance
in
the
church
of
roch
he
failed
completely
and
on
coming
out
every
one
said
he
may
be
a
man
of
talent
he
will
never
be
a
preacher
again
and
again
he
tried
until
he
succeeded
and
only
two
years
after
his
debut
lacordaire
was
preaching
in
notre
dame
to
audiences
such
as
few
french
orators
have
addressed
since
the
time
of
bossuet
and
massillon
when
cobden
first
appeared
as
a
speaker
at
a
public
meeting
in
manchester
he
completely
broke
down
and
the
chairman
apologized
for
his
failure
sir
james
graham
and
disraeli
failed
and
were
derided
at
first
and
only
succeeded
by
dint
of
great
labour
and
application
at
one
time
sir
james
graham
had
almost
given
up
public
speaking
in
despair
he
said
to
his
friend
sir
francis
baring
i
have
tried
it
every
way
extempore
from
notes
and
committing
all
to
memory
and
i
ca
do
it
i
do
know
why
it
is
but
i
am
afraid
i
shall
never
succeed
yet
by
dint
of
perseverance
graham

disraeli

to
become
one
of
the
most
effective
and
impressive
of
parliamentary
speakers
failures
in
one
direction
have
sometimes
had
the
effect
of
forcing
the
farseeing
student
to
apply
himself
in
another
thus
prideaux
failure
as
a
candidate
for
the
post
of
of

to
his
applying
himself
to

to
his
eventual
elevation

when
boileau
educated
for

pleaded
his
first
cause
he
broke
down
amidst
shouts
of
laughter
he
next
tried
the
pulpit
and
failed
there
too
and
then
he
tried
poetry
and
succeeded
fontenelle
and
voltaire
both
failed
at
the
bar
so
cowper
through
his
diffidence
and
shyness

first
cause
though
he
lived
to
revive

montesquieu
and

both
failed

forsook
the

congenial
pursuits

behind
him

to
the
persecutions
of
the
envious
vulgar
nobles
vulgar
priests
and
sordid
men
of
every
degree
who
could
neither
sympathise
with
him
nor
comprehend
his
genius
when
paul
iv
condemned
some
of
his
work
in
last
judgment
the
artist
observed
that
the
pope
would
do
better
to
occupy
himself
with
correcting
the
disorders
and
indecencies
which
disgrace
the
world
than
with
any
such
hypercriticisms
upon
his
art
tasso
also
was
the
victim
of
almost
continual
persecution
and
calumny
after
lying
in
a
madhouse
for
seven
years
he
became
a
wanderer
over
italy
and
when
on
his
deathbed
he
wrote
i
will
not
complain
of
the
malignity
of
fortune
because
i
do
not
choose
to
speak
of
the
ingratitude
of
men
who
have
succeeded
in
dragging
me
to
the
tomb
of
a
mendicant
but
time
brings
about
strange
revenges
the
persecutors
and
the
persecuted
often
change
places
it
is
the
latter
who
are
great
the
former
who
are
infamous
even
the
names
of
the
persecutors
would
probably
long
ago
have
been
forgotten
but
for
their
connection
with
the
history
of
the
men
whom
they
have
persecuted
thus
who
would
now
have
known
of
duke
alfonso
of
ferrara
but
for
his
imprisonment
of
tasso
or
who
would
have
heard
of
the
existence
of
the
grand
duke
of
wurtemburg
of
some
ninety
years
back
but
for
his
petty
persecution
of
schiller
science
also
has
had
its
martyrs
who
have
fought
their
way
to
light
through
difficulty
persecution
and
suffering
we
need
not
refer
again
to
the
cases
of
bruno
galileo
and
others
persecuted
because
of
the
supposed
heterodoxy
of
their
views
but
there
have
been
other
unfortunates
amongst
men
of
science
whose
genius
has
been
unable
to
save
them
from
the
fury
of
their
enemies
thus
bailly
the
celebrated
french
astronomer
had
been
mayor
of
paris
and
lavoisier
the
great
chemist
were
both
guillotined
in
the
first
french
revolution
when
the
latter
after
being
sentenced
to
death
by
the
commune
asked
for
a
few
days
respite
to
enable
him
to
ascertain
the
result
of
some
experiments
he
had
made
during
his
confinement
the
tribunal
refused
his
appeal
and
ordered
him
for
immediate
execution
one
of
the
judges
saying
that
the
republic
had
no
need
of
philosophers
in
england
also
about
the
same
time
priestley
the
father
of
modern
chemistry
had
his
house
burnt
over
his
head
and
his
library
destroyed
amidst
shouts

and
he
fled
from
his
native
country
to
lay
his
bones

among
the
most
melancholy
events
in
the
history
of
enterprise
and
genius
the
case
of
flinders
the
navigator
who
suffered
a
six
imprisonment
in
the
isle
of
france
was
one
of
peculiar
hardship
in
he
set
sail
from
england
in
the
investigator
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
and
survey
provided
with
a
french
pass
requiring
all
french
governors
that
england
and
france
were
at
war
to
give
him
protection
and
succour
in
the
sacred
name
of
science
in
the
course
of
his
voyage
he
surveyed
great
part
of
australia
van
diemen
land
and
the
neighbouring
islands
the
investigator
being
found
leaky
and
rotten
was
condemned
and
the
navigator
embarked
as
passenger
in
the
porpoise
for
england
to
lay
the
results
of
his
three
years
labours
before
the
admiralty
on
the
voyage
home
the
porpoise
was
wrecked
on
a
reef
in
the
south
seas
and
flinders
with
part
of
the
crew
in
an
open
boat
made
for
port
jackson
which
they
safely
reached
though
distant
from
the
scene
of
the
wreck
not
less
than
miles
there
he
procured
a
small
schooner
the
cumberland
no
larger
than
a
gravesend
and
returned
for
the
remainder
of
the
crew
who
had
been
left
on
the
reef
having
rescued
them
he
set
sail
for
england
making
for
the
isle
of
france
which
the
cumberland
reached
in
a
sinking
condition
being
a
wretched
little
craft
badly
found
to
his
surprise
he
was
made
a
prisoner
with
all
his
crew
and
thrown
into
prison
where
he
was
treated
with
brutal
harshness
his
french
pass
proving
no
protection
to
him
what
aggravated
the
horrors
of
flinders
confinement
was
that
he
knew
that
baudin
the
french
navigator
whom
he
had
encountered
while
making
his
survey
of
the
australian
coasts
would
reach
europe
first
and
claim
the
merit
of
all
the
discoveries
he
had
made
it
turned
out
as
he
had
expected
and
while
flinders
was
still
imprisoned
in
the
isle
of
france
the
french
atlas
of
the
new
discoveries
was
published
all
the
points
named
by
flinders
and
his
precursors
being
named
afresh
flinders
was
at
length
liberated
after
six
years
imprisonment
his
health
completely
broken
but
he
continued
correcting
his
maps
and
writing
out
his
descriptions
to
the
last
he
only
lived
long
enough
to
correct
his
final
sheet
for
the
press
and
died
on
the
very
day
that
his
work
was
published
courageous
men
have
often
turned
enforced
solitude
to
account
in
executing
works
of
great
pith
and
moment
it
is
in
solitude
that
the
passion
for
spiritual
perfection
best
nurses
itself
the
soul
communes
with
itself
in
loneliness
until
its
energy
often
becomes
intense
but
whether
a
man
profits
by
solitude
or
not
will
mainly
depend
upon
his
own
temperament
training
and
character
while
in
a
man
solitude
will
make
the
pure
heart
purer
in
the
man
it
will
only
serve
to
make
the
hard
heart
still
harder
for
though
solitude
may
be
the
nurse
of
great
spirits
it
is
the
torment
of
small
ones
it
was
in
prison
that
boetius
wrote
his
of
philosophy
and
grotius
his
on
matthew
regarded
as
his
masterwork

biblical
criticism

italian
patriot
monk
suspected
of
treason
was
immured
for
years
in
a
neapolitan
dungeon
during
which
deprived
of
the
sun
light
he
sought
higher
light
and
there
created
his
solis
which
has
been
so
often
reprinted
and
reproduced
in
translations
in
most
european
languages
during
his
thirteen

in
the

raleigh
wrote
his

a
project
of
vast
extent
of
which
he
was
only
able
to
finish

five
books
luther
occupied
his
prison
hours
in
the
castle
of
wartburg
in
translating
the
bible
and
in
writing
the
famous
tracts
and
treatises
with
which
he
inundated
all
germany
it
was
to
the
circumstance
of
john
bunyan
having
been
cast
into
gaol
that
we
probably
owe
the
progress
he
was
thus
driven
in
upon
himself
having
no
opportunity
for
action
his
active
mind
found
vent
in
earnest
thinking
and
meditation
and
indeed
after
his
enlargement
his
life
as
an
author
virtually
ceased
his
abounding
and
the
war
were
also
written
in
prison
bunyan
lay
in
bedford
gaol
with
a
few
intervals
of
precarious
liberty
during
not
less
than
twelve
years
and
it
was
most
probably
to
his
prolonged
imprisonment
that
we
owe
what
macaulay
has
characterised
as
the
finest
allegory
in
the
world
all
the
political
parties
of
the
times
in
which
bunyan
lived
imprisoned
their
opponents
when
they
had
the
opportunity
and
the
power
prison
experiences
were
principally
in
the
time
of
charles
ii
but
in
the
preceding
reign
of
charles
as
well
as
during
the
commonwealth
illustrious
prisoners
were
very
numerous
the
prisoners
of
the
former
included
sir
john
eliot
hampden
selden
prynne
most
voluminous
and
many
more
it
was
while
under

confinement
in

that
eliot
composed
his
noble
treatise

george
wither
the
poet
was
another
prisoner
of
charles
the
first
and
it
was
while
confined
in
the
marshalsea
that
he
wrote
his
famous
to
the
king
at
the
restoration
he
was
again
imprisoned
in
newgate
from
which
he
was
transferred
to
the
tower
and
he
is
supposed
by
some
to
have
died
there
the
commonwealth
also
had
its
prisoners
sir
william
davenant
because
of
his
loyalty
was
for
some
time
confined
a
prisoner
in
cowes
castle
where
he
wrote
the
greater
part
of
his
poem
of
and
it
is
said
that
his
life
was
saved
principally
through
the
generous
intercession
of
milton
he
lived
to
repay
the
debt
and
to
save
life
when
charles
enjoyed
his
own
again
lovelace
the
poet
and
cavalier
was
also
imprisoned
by
the
roundheads
and
was
only
liberated
from
the
gatehouse
on
giving
an
enormous
bail
though
he
suffered
and
lost
all
for
the
stuarts
he
was
forgotten
by
them
at
the
restoration

died
in
extreme
poverty

most
remarkable

have
been
comparatively
few
in
number
among
the
most
illustrious
were
de

who
besides
standing
three
times
in
the
pillory
spent
much
of
his
time
in
prison
writing
crusoe
there
and
many
of
his
best
political
pamphlets
there
also
he
wrote

of

the
best

are

was
one
of
the
latest
and
most
illustrious
of
the
prison
writers
of

he
lay
confined
in
austrian
gaols
for
ten
years
eight
of
which
he
passed
in
the
castle
of
spielberg
in
moravia
it
was
there
that
he
composed
his
charming
the
only
materials
for
which
were
furnished
by
his
fresh
living
habit
of
observation
and
out
of
even
the
transient
visits
of
his
gaoler
daughter
and
the
colourless
events
of
his
monotonous
daily
life
he
contrived
to
make
for
himself
a
little
world
of
thought
and
healthy
human
interest
kazinsky
the
great
reviver
of
hungarian
literature
spent
seven
years
of
his
life
in
the
dungeons
of
buda
brunne
kufstein
and
munkacs
during
which
he
wrote
a
of
his
imprisonment
and
amongst
other
things
translated

beguiled
his
two
years
imprisonment

who
like
these
suffer
the
penalty
of
law
and
seem
to
fail
at
least
for
a
time
do
not
really
fail
many
who
have
seemed
to
fail
utterly
have
often
exercised
a
more
potent
and
enduring
influence
upon
their
race
than
those
whose
career
has
been
a
course
of
uninterupted
success
the
character
of
a
man
does
not
depend
on
whether
his
efforts
are
immediately
followed
by
failure
or
by
success
the
martyr
is
not
a
failure
if
the
truth
for
which
he
suffered
acquires
a
fresh
lustre
through
his
sacrifice
the
patriot
who
lays
down
his
life
for
his
cause
may
thereby
hasten
its
triumph
and
those
who
seem
to
throw
their
lives
away
in
the
van
of
a
great
movement
often
open
a
way
for
those
who
follow
them
and
pass
over
their
dead
bodies
to
victory
the
triumph
of
a
just
cause
may
come
late
but
when
it
does
come
it
is
due
as
much
to
those
who
failed
in
their
first
efforts
as
to
those
who
succeeded
in
their
last
the
example
of
a
great
death
may
be
an
inspiration
to
others
as
well
as
the
example
of
a
good
life
a
great
act
does
not
perish
with
the
life
of
him
who
performs
it
but
lives
and
grows
up
into
like
acts
in
those
who
survive
the
doer
thereof
and
cherish
his
memory
of
some
great
men
it
might
almost
be
said
that
they
have
not
begun
to
live
until
they
have
died
the
names
of
the
men
who
have
suffered
in
the
cause
of
religion
of
science
and
of
truth
are
the
men
of
all
others
whose
memories
are
held
in
the
greatest
esteem
and
reverence
by
mankind
they
perished
but
their
truth
survived
they
seemed
to
fail
and
yet
they
eventually
succeeded
prisons
may
have
held
them
but
their
thoughts
were
not
to
be
confined
by
they
have
burst
through
and
defied
the
power
of
their
persecutors
it
was
lovelace
a
prisoner
who
wrote
stone
walls
do
not
a
prison
make
nor
iron
bars
a
cage
minds
innocent
and
quiet
take
that
for
a
hermitage
it
was
a
saying
of
milton
that
who
best
can
suffer
best
can
do
the
work
of
many
of
the
greatest
men
inspired
by
duty
has
been
done
amidst
suffering
and
trial
and
difficulty
they
have
struggled
against
the
tide
and
reached
the
shore
exhausted
only
to
grasp
the
sand
and
expire
they
have
done
their
duty
and
been
content
to
die
but
death
hath
no
power
over
such
men
their
hallowed
memories
still
survive
to
soothe
and
purify
and
bless
us
life
said
goethe
to
us
all
is
suffering
who
save
god
alone
shall
call
us
to
our
reckoning
let
not
reproaches
fall
on
the
departed
not
what
they
have
failed
in
nor
what
they
have
suffered
but
what
they
have
done
ought
to
occupy
the
survivors
thus
it
is
not
ease
and
facility
that
tries
men
and
brings
out
the
good
that
is
in
them
so
much
as
trial
and
difficulty
adversity
is
the
touchstone
of
character
as
some
herbs
need
to
be
crushed
to
give
forth
their
sweetest
odour
so
some
natures
need
to
be
tried
by
suffering
to
evoke
the
excellence
that
is
in
them
hence
trials
often
unmask
virtues
and
bring
to
light
hidden
graces
men
apparently
useless
and
purposeless
when
placed
in
positions
of
difficulty
and
responsibility
have
exhibited
powers
of
character
before
unsuspected
and
where
we
before
saw
only
pliancy
and
we
now
see
strength
valour
and
as
there
are
no
blessings
which
may
not
be
perverted
into
evils
so
there
are
no
trials
which
may
not
be
converted
into
blessings
all
depends
on
the
manner
in
which
we
profit
by
them
or
otherwise
perfect
happiness
is
not
to
be
looked
for
in
this
world
if
it
could
be
secured
it
would
be
found
profitless
the
hollowest
of
all
gospels
is
the
gospel
of
ease
and
comfort
difficulty
and
even
failure
are
far
better
teachers
sir
humphry
davy
said
even
in
private
life
too
much
prosperity
either
injures
the
moral
man
and
occasions
conduct
which
ends
in
suffering
or
it
is
accompanied
by
the
workings
of
envy
calumny
and
malevolence
of
others
failure
improves
tempers
and
strengthens
the
nature
even
sorrow
is
in
some
mysterious
way
linked
with
joy
and
associated
with
tenderness
john
bunyan
once
said
how
if
it
were
lawful
he
could
even
pray
for
greater
trouble
for
the
greater
comfort
sake
when
surprise
was
expressed
at
the
patience
of
a
poor
arabian
woman
under
heavy
affliction
she
said
when
we
look
on
god
face
we
do
not
feel
his
hand
suffering
is
doubtless
as
divinely
appointed
as
joy
while
it
is
much
more
influential
as
a
discipline
of
character
it

shelley
has
said
of
poets
most
wretched
men
are
cradled
into
poetry
by
wrong
they
learn
in
suffering
what
they
teach
in
song
does
any
one
suppose
that
burns
would
have
sung
as
he
did
had
he
been
rich
respectable

kept

gig
or
byron

he
had
been

prosperous

or
sometimes
a
heartbreak

an
impassive
nature
to

what
does
he
know
said
a
sage
who
has
not
suffered
when
dumas
asked
reboul
what
made
you
a
poet
his
answer
was
suffering
it
was
the
death
first
of
his
wife
and
then
of
his
child
that
drove
him
into
solitude
for
the
indulgence
of
his
grief
and
eventually
led
him
to
seek
and
find
relief
in
verse
it
was
also
to
a
domestic
affliction
that
we
owe
the
beautiful
writings
of
gaskell
it
was
as
a
recreation
in
the
highest
sense
of
the
word
says
a
recent
writer
speaking
from
personal
knowledge
as
an
escape
from
the
great
void
of
a
life
from
which
a
cherished
presence
had
been
taken
that
she
began
that
series
of
exquisite
creations
which
has
served
to
multiply
the
number
of
our
acquaintances
and
to
enlarge
even
the
circle
of
our
friendships
much
of
the
best
and
most
useful
work
done
by
men
and
women
has
been
done
amidst
affliction
sometimes
as
a
relief
from
it
sometimes
from
a
sense
of
duty
overpowering
personal
sorrow

i
had
not
been
so
great

schiller
produced
his
greatest
tragedies
in
the
midst
of
physical
suffering
almost
amounting
to
torture
handel
was
never
greater
than
when
warned
by
palsy
of
the
approach
of
death
and
struggling
with
distress
and
suffering
he
sat
down
to
compose
the
great
works
which
have
made
his
name
immortal
in
music
mozart
composed
his
great
operas
and
last
of
all
his
when
oppressed
by
debt
and
struggling
with
a
fatal
disease
beethoven
produced
his
greatest
works
amidst
gloomy
sorrow
when
oppressed
by
almost
total
deafness
and
poor
schubert

his
short
but
brilliant
life
laid
it
down
at
the
early
age
of

sole
property
at
his
death
consisting
of
his
manuscripts
the
clothes
he
wore
and
florins
in
money
some
of
lamb
finest
writings
were
produced
amidst
deep
sorrow
and
apparent
gaiety

from

suffering
heart
as
he
himself
wrote

have
the
noble
instance
of
the
suffering
wollaston
even
in
the
last
stages
of
the
mortal
disease
which
afflicted
him
devoting
his
numbered
hours
to
putting

the
various
discoveries
and
improvements
he
had
made
so
that
any

he

acquired

might
not

dark
cottage
batter
and

lets
in
new
light
through
chinks
that
time
has
made
consider
said
jeremy
taylor
that
sad
accidents
and
a
state
of
afflictions
is
a
school
of
virtue
it
reduces
our
spirits
to
soberness
and
our
counsels
to
moderation
it
corrects
levity
and
interrupts
the
confidence
of
sinning
god
who
in
mercy
and
wisdom
governs
the
world
would
never
have
suffered
so
many
sadnesses
and
have
sent
them
especially
to
the
most
virtuous
and
the
wisest
men
but
that
he
intends
they
should
be
the
seminary
of
comfort
the
nursery
of
virtue
the
exercise
of
wisdom
the
trial
of
patience
the
venturing
for
a
crown
and
the
gate
of
glory
and
again
no
man
is
more
miserable
than
he
that
hath
no
adversity
that
man
is
not
tried
whether
he
be
good
or
bad
and
god
never
crowns
those
virtues
which
are
only
faculties
and
dispositions
but
every
act
of
virtue
is
an
ingredient
unto
reward
prosperity
and
success
of
themselves
do
not
confer
happiness
indeed
it
not
unfrequently
happens
that
the
least
successful
in
life
have
the
greatest
share
of
true
joy
in
it
no
man
could
have
been
more
successful
than
goethe
possessed
of
splendid
health
honour
power
and
sufficiency
of
this
world
goods
and
yet
he
confessed
that
he
had
not
in
the
course
of
his
life
enjoyed
five
weeks
of
genuine
pleasure
so
the
caliph
abdalrahman
in
surveying
his
successful
reign
of
fifty
years
found
that
he
had
enjoyed
only
fourteen
days
of
pure
and
genuine
happiness
after
this
might
it
not
be
said
that
the
pursuit
of
mere
happiness
is
an
illusion
life
all
sunshine
without
shade
all
happiness
without
sorrow
all
pleasure
without
pain
were
not
life
at
all
at
least
not
human
life
take
the
lot
of
the
happiest
it
is
a
tangled
yarn
it
is
made
up
of
sorrows
and
joys
and
the
joys
are
all
the
sweeter
because
of
the
sorrows
bereavements
and
blessings
one
following
another
making
us
sad
and
blessed
by
turns
even
death
itself
makes
life
more
loving
it
binds
us
more
closely
together
while
here
thomas
browne
has
argued
that
death
is
one
of
the
necessary
conditions
of
human
happiness
and
he
supports
his
argument
with
great
force
and
eloquence
but
when
death
comes
into
a
household
we
do
not
philosophise
we
only
feel
the
eyes
that
are
full
of
tears
do
not
see
though
in
course
of
time
they
come
to
see
more
clearly
and
brightly
than
those
that
have
never
known
sorrow
the
wise
person
gradually
learns
not
to
expect
too
much
from
life
while
he
strives
for
success
by
worthy
methods
he
will
be
prepared
for
failures
he
will
keep
his
mind
open
to
enjoyment
but
submit
patiently
to
suffering
wailings
and
complainings
of
life
are
never
of
any
use
only
cheerful
and
continuous
working
in
right
paths
are
of
real
avail
nor
will
the
wise
man
expect
too
much
from
those
about
him
if
he
would
live
at
peace
with
others
he
will
bear
and
forbear
and
even
the
best
have
often
foibles
of
character
which
have
to
be
endured
sympathised
with
and
perhaps
pitied
who
is
perfect
who
does
not
suffer
from
some
thorn
in
the
flesh
who
does
not
stand
in
need
of
toleration
of
forbearance
of
forgiveness
what
the
poor
imprisoned
queen
caroline
matilda
of
denmark
wrote
on
her
ought
to
be
the
prayer
of
all
oh
keep
me
innocent
make
others
great
then
how
much
does
the
disposition
of
every
human
being
depend
upon
their
innate
constitution
and
their
early
surroundings
the
comfort
or
discomfort
of
the
homes
in
which
they
have
been
brought
up
their
inherited
characteristics
and
the
examples
good
or
bad
to
which
they
have
been
exposed
through
life
regard
for
such
considerations
should
teach
charity
and
forbearance
to
all
men
at
the
same
time
life
will
always
be
to
a
large
extent
what
we
ourselves
make
it
each
mind
makes
its
own
little
world
the
cheerful
mind
makes
it
pleasant
and
the
discontented
mind
makes
it
miserable
my
mind
to
me
a
kingdom
is
applies
alike
to
the
peasant
as
to
the
monarch
the
one
may
be
in
his
heart
a
king
as
the
other
may
be
a
slave
life
is
for
the
most
part
but
the
mirror
of
our
own
individual
selves
our
mind
gives
to
all
situations
to
all
fortunes
high
or
low
their
real
characters
to
the
good
the
world
is
good
to
the
bad
it
is
bad
if
our
views
of
life
be
elevated
if
we
regard
it
as
a
sphere
of
useful
effort
of
high
living
and
high
thinking
of
working
for
good
as
well
as
our
own
it
will
be
joyful
hopeful
and
blessed
if
on
the
contrary
we
regard
it
merely
as
affording
opportunities
for
pleasure
and
aggrandisement
it
will
be
full
of
toil
anxiety
and
disappointment
there
is
much
in
life
that
while
in
this
state
we
can
never
comprehend
there
is
indeed
a
great
deal
of
mystery
in
life
much
that
we
see
as
in
a
glass
darkly
but
though
we
may
not
apprehend
the
full
meaning
of
the
discipline
of
trial
through
which
the
best
have
to
pass
we
must
have
faith
in
the
completeness
of
the
design
of
which
our
little
individual
lives
form
a
part
we
have
each
to
do
our
duty
in
that
sphere
of
life
in
which
we
have
been
placed
duty
alone
is
true
there
is
no
true
action
but
in
its
accomplishment
duty
is
the
end
and
aim
of
the
highest
life
the
truest
pleasure
of
all
is
that
derived
from
the
consciousness
of
its
fulfilment
of
all
others
it
is
the
one
that
is
most
thoroughly
satisfying
and
the
least
accompanied
by
regret
and
disappointment
in
the
words
of
george
herbert
the
consciousness
of
duty
performed
gives
us
music
at
midnight
and
when
we
have
done
our
work
on
earth
of
necessity
of
labour
of
love
or
of
duty
like
the
silkworm
that
spins
its
little
cocoon
and
dies
we
too
depart
but
short
though
our
stay
in
life
may
be
it
is
the
appointed
sphere
in
which
each
has
to
work
out
the
great
aim
and
end
of
his
being
to
the
best
of
his
power
and
when
that
is
done
the
accidents
of
the
flesh
will
affect
but
little
the
immortality
we
shall
at
last
put
on
therefore
we
can
go
die
as
sleep
and
trust
half
that
we
have
unto
an
honest
faithful
grave
making
our
pillows
either
down
or
dust

up

called
the

such

that

may
do

you
have
their
true
welfare
at

you

not

you

the

remarks

as
they

life
to
a
combination
of
moderate
abilities
with
honesty

intention
firmness

steadiness

conduct
if
i
were
to
offer
advice
to
any
young
man
anxious
to
make
himself
useful

i
would
sum
up
the
results
of
my
experience
in
three
short
rules
rules
so
simple
that
any
man
may
understand
them
and
so
easy
that
any
man
may
act
upon
them
my
first
rule
would
be
leave
it
to
others
to
judge
of
what
duties
you
are
capable
and
for
what
position
you
are
fitted
but
never
refuse
to
give
your
services
in
whatever
capacity
it
may
be
the
opinion
of
others
who
are
competent
to
judge
that
you
may
benefit
your
neighbours
or
your
country
my
second
rule
is
when
you
agree
to
undertake
public
duties
concentrate
every
energy
and
faculty
in
your
possession
with
the
determination
to
discharge
those
duties
to
the
best
of
your
ability
lastly
i
would
counsel
you
that
in
deciding
on
the
line
which
you
will
take
in
public
affairs
you
should
be
guided
in
your
decision
by
that
which
after
mature
deliberation
you
believe
to
be
right
and
not
by
that
which
in
the
passing
hour
may
happen
to
be
fashionable
or
popular

broken

having
broken
it

explained
that
he
could
not
mend
the
bowl

the
trouble
he
could
by
the
gift
of
a
sixpence
to
buy
another
however
on
opening
his
purse
it
was
empty
of
silver

had
to
make
amends
by
promising
to
meet
his

friend
in

spot
at
the

hour
next
day

to
bring
the
sixpence

of
still
being
in

that

one
after

the
fine
qualities
of
the
nation
are
dying
out
where
is
the
generosity
the
loyalty
the
charm
of
our
esprit
and
our
former
elevation
of
soul
if
this
goes
on
the
time
will
come
when
this
noble
race
of
france
will
be
known
only
by
its
faults
and
france
has
no
idea
that
while
she
is
sinking
more
earnest
nations
are
stealing
the
march
upon
her
are
distancing
her
on
the
road
to
progress
and
are
preparing
for
her
a
secondary
position
in
the
world
i
am
afraid
that
these
opinions
will
not
be
relished
in
france
however
correct
they
differ
too
much
from
what
is
usually
said
and
asserted
at
home
i
should
wish
some
enlightened
and
unprejudiced
frenchmen
to
come
to
prussia
and
make
this
country
their
study
they
would
soon
discover
that
they
were
living
in
the
midst
of
a
strong
earnest
and
intelligent
nation
entirely
destitute
it
is
true
of
noble
and
delicate
feelings
of
all
fascinating
charms
but
endowed
with
every
solid
virtue
and
alike
distinguished
for
untiring
industry
order
and
economy
as
well
as
for
patriotism
a
strong
sense
of
duty
and
that
consciousness
of
personal
dignity
which
in
their
case
is
so
happily
blended
with
respect
for
authority
and
obedience
to
the
law
they
would
see
a
country
with
firm
sound
and
moral
institutions
whose
upper
classes
are
worthy
of
their
rank
and
by
possessing
the
highest
degree
of
culture
devoting
themselves
to
the
service
of
the
state
setting
an
example
of
patriotism
and
knowing
how
to
preserve
the
influence
legitimately
their
own
they
would
find
a
state
with
an
excellent
administration
where
everything
is
in
its
right
place
and
where
the
most
admirable
order
prevails
in
every
branch
of
the
social
and
political
system
prussia
may
be
well
compared
to
a
massive
structure
of
lofty
proportions
and
astounding
solidity
which
though
it
has
nothing
to
delight
the
eye
or
speak
to
the
heart
can
not
but
impress
us
with
its
grand
symmetry
equally
observable
in
its
broad
foundations
as
in
its
strong
and
sheltering
roof
and
what
is
france
what
is
french
society
in
these
latter
days
a
of
disorderly
elements
all
mixed
and
jumbled
together
a
country
in
which
everybody
claims
the
right
to
occupy
the
highest
posts
yet
few
remember
that
a
man
to
be
employed
in
a
responsible
position
ought
to
have
a
mind
ought
to
be
strictly
moral
to
know
something
of
the
world
and
possess
certain
intellectual
powers
a
country
in
which
the
highest
offices
are
frequently
held
by
ignorant
and
uneducated
persons
who
either
boast
some
special
talent
or
whose
only
claim
is
social
position
and
some
versatility
and
address
what
a
baneful
and
degrading
state
of
things
and
how
natural
that
while
it
lasts
france
should
be
full
of
a
people
without
a
position
without
a
calling
who
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
themselves
but
are
none
the
less
eager
to
envy
and
malign
every
one
who

turn
it

conceited
and
egotistic
as
they
are
the
people

object
to
an
innovation
whose
invigorating
force
they
are
unable
to
comprehend
and
which
can
not
be
carried
out
without
virtues
which
they
do
not
possess
conscientious
recognition
of
duty
and
a
willingness
to
sacrifice
personal
interests
to
the
loftier
demands
of
the
country

the
character

require
a
chastisement

the

extract

give
one
an
idea
of
the
extraordinary
labours
of
lady
hamilton
to
whose
unfailing
devotion
to
the
service
of
her
husband
the
world
of
intellect
has
been
so
much
indebted

number

veitch
filled
with
abstruse
metaphysical
matter
original
and
quoted
bristling
with
proportional
and
syllogistic
formulae
that
are
still
preserved
is
perfectly
marvellous
everything
that
was
sent
to
the
press
and
all
the
courses
of
lectures
were
written
by
her
either
to
dictation
or
from
a
copy
this
work
she
did
in
the
truest
spirit
of
love
and
devotion
she
had
a
power
moreover
of
keeping
her
husband
up
to
what
he
had
to
do
she
contended
wisely
against
a
sort
of
energetic
indolence
which
characterised
him
and
which
while
he
was
always
labouring
made
him
apt
to
put
aside
the
task
actually
before
him
sometimes
diverted
by
subjects
of
inquiry
suggested
in
the
course
of
study
on
the
matter
in
hand
sometimes
discouraged
by
the
difficulty
of
reducing
to
order
the
immense
mass
of
materials
he
had
accumulated
in
connection
with
it
then
her
resolution
and
cheerful
disposition
sustained
and
refreshed
him
and
never
more
so
than
when
during
the
last
twelve
years
of
his
life
his
bodily
strength
was
broken
and
his
spirit
though
languid
yet
ceased
not
from
mental
toil
the
truth
is
that
sir
william
marriage
his
comparatively
limited
circumstances
and
the
character
of
his
wife
supplied
to
a
nature
that
would
have
been
contented
to
spend
its
mighty
energies
in
work
that
brought
no
reward
but
in
the
doing
of
it
and
that
might
never
have
been
made
publicly
known
or
available
the
practical
force
and
impulse
which
enabled
him
to
accomplish
what
he
actually
did
in
literature
and
philosophy
it
was
this
influence
without
doubt
which
saved
him
from
utter
absorption
in
his
world
of
rare
noble
and
elevated
but
unattainable
ideas
but
for
it
the
serene
sea
of
abstract
thought
might
have
held
him
becalmed
for
life
and
in
the
absence
of
all
utterance
of
definite
knowledge
of
his
conclusions
the
world
might
have
been
left
