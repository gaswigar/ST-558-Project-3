the
mountain
was
spinning
not
dizzily
not
even
rapidly
but
very
perceptibly
the
great
mass
of
jagged
rock
was
turning
on
its
axis
captain
simon
scowled
at
it
by
damn
jules
he
said
if
you
can
see
spinning
it
too
damn
fast
he
expected
no
answer
and
got
none
he
tapped
the
drive
pedal
gently
with
his
right
foot
his
gaze
shifting
alternately
from
the
instrument
board
to
the
looming
hulk
of
stone
before
him
as
the
little
spacecraft
moved
in
closer
he
tapped
the
reverse
pedal
with
his
left
foot
he
was
now
ten
meters
from
the
surface
of
the
asteroid
it
was
moving
all
right
well
jules
he
said
in
his
most
commanding
voice
we
see
just
how

all

on
the
line
he
touched
a
button
with
his
right
thumb
the
ship
quivered
almost
imperceptibly
as
a
jet
of
liquid
leaped
from
the
gun
mounted
in
the
nose
of
the
ship
at
the
same
time
he
hit
the
reverse
pedal
and
backed
the
ship
away
from
the
asteroid
surface
no
point
getting
any
more
gunk
on
the
hull
than
necessary
the
jet
of
liquid
struck
the
surface
of
the
rotating
mountain
and
splashed
leaving
a
big
splotch
of
silvery
glitter
even
in
the
vacuum
of
space
the
solvents
of
the
paint
vehicle
took
time
to
boil
off
how

he
jockeyed
the
little
spacecraft
around
until
he
was
reasonably
stationary
with
respect
to
the
great
hunk
of
whirling
rock
and
had
the
blotch
centered
on
the
crosshairs
of
the
peeper
in
front
of
him
then
he
punched
the
button
that
started
the
timer
and
waited
for
the
silver
spot
to
come
round
again
the
asteroid
was
roughly
spherical
which
was
unusual
but
not
remarkable
the
radar
gave
him
the
distance
from
the
surface
of
the
asteroid
and
he
measured
the
diameter
and
punched
it
through
the
calculator
observe
he
said
in
a
dry
didactic
voice
the
diameter
is
on
the
order
of
five
times
ten
to
the
fourteenth
micromicrons
he
kept
punching
at
the
calculator
if
we
assume
a
mean
density
of
two
point
six
six
times
ten
to
the
minus
metric
tons
per

micromicron
we
attain
a
mean

of
some
one

seven
four
times
ten
to
the
eleventh
kilograms
more
punching
while
he
kept
his
eye
on
the
meteorite
waiting
for
the
spot
to
show
up
again
and
that
my
dear
jules
gives
us
a
surface
gravity
of
approximately
two
times
ten
to
the

then
there
was
a
long
silent
wait
while
the
asteroid
went
its
leisurely
way
around
its
own
axis
there
it
comes
said
captain
simon
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
crosshair
of
the
peeper
one
hand
over
the
timer
button
when
the
silver
splotch
drifted
by
the
crosshair
he
punched
the
stop
button
and
looked
at
the
indicator
sixteen
minutes
forty
seconds
how
handy
he
punched
at
the
calculator
again
ah
you
see
jules
just
as

sukiyaki
my
dear
chap
sometimes
your
brilliance
amazes
me
well
at
least
it
meant
that
there
would
be
no
loose
rubble
on
the
surface
it
would
have
been
tossed
off
long
ago
by
the
centrifugal
force
flying
off
on
a
tangent
to
become
more
of
the
tiny
rubble
of
the
belt
perhaps
flying
was
exactly
the
right
word
though
when
applied
to
a
velocity
of
less
than
one
centimeter
per
second
off
then
what
do
you
think
jules
said
simon
waal
ah
reckon
we
can
do
it
we
go
to
the
one
o
them
thar
poles
well
let
see
he
leaned
over
and
punched
more
figures
into
the
calculator
ai
that
purty
ter
this
thar
a
spot
at
each
pole
a
meter
in
diameter
whar
the
is
than
the
force
captain
simon
looked
at
the
figures
on
the
calculator
the
forces
in
any
case
were
negligibly
small
on
earth
where
the
surface
gravity
was
per
cent
of
a
standard
gee
simon
weighed
close
to
two
hundred
pounds
discounting
the
spin
he
would
weigh
about
four
of
a
pound
on
the
asteroid
he
was
inspecting
the
spin
at
the
equator
would
try
to
push
him
off
with
a
force
of
about
two
tenths
of
a
pound
but
a
man
who
did
take
those
forces
into
account
could
get
himself
killed
in
the
belt
very
well
jules
he
said
we
inspect
the
poles
do
you
think
they
vill
velcome
us
in
kraukau
the
area
around
the
north
pole
defined
as
that
pole
from
which
the
body
appears
to
be
spinning
counterclockwise
looked
more
suitable
for
operations
than
the
south
pole
theoretically
simon
could
have
stopped
the
spin
but
that
would
have
required
an
energy
expenditure
of
some
thousand
in
the
first
place
and
it
would
have
required
an
anchor
to
be
set
somewhere
on
the
equator
since
his
purpose
in
landing
on
the
asteroid
was
to
set
just
such
an
anchor
stopping
the
spin
would
be
a
waste
of
time
and
energy
captain
simon
positioned
his
little
spacecraft
a
couple
of
meters
above
the
north
pole
it
would
take
better
than
six
minutes
to
fall
that
far
so
he
had
plenty
of
time
perhaps
a
boarding
party
christian
on
the
double
aye
sir
on
the
double
it
is
sir
simon
pushed
himself
over
to
the
locker
took
out
his
vacuum
suit
and
climbed
into
it
after
checking
it
thoroughly
he
said
prepare
to
evacuate
main
control
room
mr
christian
aye
aye
sir
all
prepared
and
ready
i
hope
captain
simon
looked
around
to
make
sure
he
had
left
a
bottle
of
coffee
sitting
somewhere
he
done
that
once
and
the
stuff
had
boiled
out
all
over
everywhere
when
he
pulled
the
air
out
of
the
little
room
nope
no
coffee
no
obstacles
to
turning
on
the
pump
he
thumbed
the
button
and
the
pumps
started
to
whine
the
whine
built
up
to
a
crescendo
then
began
to
die
away
until
finally
it
could
only
be
felt
through
the
walls
or
floor
the
air
was
gone
then
he
checked
the
manometer
to
make
sure
that
most
of
the
air
had
actually
been
pumped
back
into
the
reserve
tanks
satisfied
he
touched
the
button
that
would
open
the
door
there
was
a
faint
jar
as
the
remaining
wisps
of
air
shot
out
into
the
vacuum
of
space
simon
sat
back
down
at
the
controls
and
carefully
repositioned
the
ship
it
was
now
less
than
a
meter
from
the
surface
he
pushed
himself
over
to
the
open
door
and
looked
out
he
clipped
one
end
of
his
safety
cable
to
the
steel
at
the
edge
of
the
door
fasten
on
carefully
jules
he
said
we
do
want
to
lose
anything
like
what
like
this
spaceship
petit
tÃªte
de
ah
but
no
my
old
and
raw
we
could
not
afford
to
lose
the
could
we
the
other
end
of
the
long
cable
was
connected
to
the
belt
of
the
suit
then
simon
launched
himself
out
the
open
door
toward
the
surface
of
the
planetoid
the
ship
began
to
drift
very
slowly
but
not
so
slowly
as
it
had
been
falling
off
in
the
other
direction
he
had
picked
the
spot
he
was
aiming
for
there
was
a
jagged
hunk
of
rock
sticking
out
that
looked
as
though
it
would
make
a
good
handhold
right
nearby
there
was
a
fairly
smooth
spot
that
would
do
to
brake
his
fall
he
struck
it
with
his
palm
and
took
up
the
slight
shock
with
his
elbow
while
his
other
hand
grasped
the
outcropping
he
had
not
pushed
himself
very
hard
there
is
not
much
weathering
on
the
surface
of
an
asteroid
soften
the
contours
of
the
rock
a
little
over
the
millions
of
millennia
but
not
much
since
the
debris
in
the
belt
all
has
roughly
the
same
velocity
collisions
do
occur
but
they
are
the
violent
smashes
that
make
the
brilliant
meteor
displays
of
earth
and
there
is
still
a
standing
argument
among
the
men
of
the
belt
as
to
whether
that
sort
of
action
can
be
called
weathering
most
of
the
collisions
tend
to
cause
fracturing
of
the
surface
which
results
in
jagged
edges
a
man
in
a
vacuum
suit
does
not
push
himself
against
a
surface
like
that
with
any
great
velocity
simon
knew
to
a
nicety
that
he
could
propel
himself
against
a
bed
of
nails
and
broken
glass
at
just
the
right
velocity
to
be
able
to
stop
himself
without
so
much
as
scratching
his
glove
and
he
could
see
that
there
was
no
ragged
stuff
on
the
spot
he
had
selected
the
slanting
rays
of
the
sun
would
have
made
them
stand
out
in
relief
now
he
was
clinging
to
the
surface
of
the
mountain
of
rock
like
a
bug
on
the
side
of
a
cliff
on
a
asteroid
he
could
have
walked
around
on
the
surface
using
the
magnetic
soles
of
his
vacuum
suit
but
silicate
rock
is
notably
lacking
in
response
to
that
attractive
force
no
soul
maybe
but
directly
and
indirectly
that
lack
of
response
to
magnetic
forces
was
the
reason
for
simon
crawling
around
on
the
surface
of
that
asteroid
directly
because
there
was
no
other
way
he
could
move
about
on
a
nonmetallic
asteroid
indirectly
because
there
was
no
way
the
big
space
tugs
could
get
a
grip
on
such
an
asteroid
either
the
brutes
were
a
dead
cinch
to
haul
off
to
the
smelters
all
a
space
tug
had
to
do
was
latch
on
to
one
of
them
with
a
magnetic
grapple
and
start
hauling
there
was
no
such
simple
answer
for
the
silicate
rocks
the
asteroids
were
necessary
they
supplied
the
building
material
and
the
major
export
of
the
belt
cities
they
averaged
around
eighty
to
ninety
per
cent
iron
anywhere
from
five
to
twenty
per
cent
nickel
and
perhaps
half
a
per
cent
cobalt
with
smatterings
of
phosphorous
sulfur
carbon
copper
and
chromium
necessary
but
not
sufficient
the
silicate
rocks
ran
only
about
per
cent
iron
in
the
form
of
nonmagnetic
compounds
they
averaged
eighteen
per
cent
silicon
fourteen
per
cent
magnesium
between
one
and
one
point
five
per
cent
each
of
aluminum
nickel
and
calcium
and
dollops
of
sodium
chromium
phosphorous
manganese
cobalt
potassium
and
titanium
but
more
important
than
these
as
far
as
the
immediate
needs
of
the
belt
cities
were
concerned
was
a
big
whopping
per
cent
oxygen
in
the
belt
cities
they
had
soon
learned
that
physically
speaking
the
stuff
of
life
was
bread
and
no
matter
how
carefully
oxygen
is
conserved
no
process
is
one
hundred
per
cent
efficient
there
will
be
leakage
into
space
and
that
which
is
lost
must
be
replaced
there
is
plenty
of
oxygen
locked
up
in
those
silicates
the
problem
is
towing
them
to
the
processing
plants
where
the
stuff
can
be
extracted
captain
simon
job
was
simple
all
he
had
to
do
was
sink
an
anchor
into
the
asteroid
so
that
the
space
tugs
could
get
a
grip
on
it
once
he
had
done
that
the
rest
of
the
job
was
up
to
the
tug
crew
he
crawled
across
the
face
of
the
floating
mountain
at
the
spot
where
the
north
pole
was
he
braced
himself
and
then
took
a
quick
look
around
at
the
she
was
moving
very
fast
he
had
plenty
of
time
he
took
a
steel
piton
out
of
his
tool
pack
transferred
it
to
his
left
hand
and
took
out
a
hammer
then
working
carefully
he
hammered
the
piton
into
a
narrow
cleft
in
the
rock
three
more
of
the
steel
spikes
were
hammered
into
the
surface
forming
a
rough
quadrilateral
around
the
pole
that
looks
good
enough
to
me
jules
he
said
when
he
had
finished
now
that
we
have
our
little
anchors
we
can
put
the
monster
in
then
he
grabbed
his
safety
line
and
pulled
himself
back
to
the
the
small
craft
had
floated
away
from
the
asteroid
a
little
but
not
much
he
repositioned
it
after
he
got
the
rocket
drill
out
of
the
storage
compartment
make
way
for
the
stovepipe
he
said
as
he
pushed
the
drill
ahead
of
him
out
the
door
this
time
he
pulled
himself
back
to
his
drilling
site
by
means
of
a
cable
which
he
had
attached
to
one
of
the
pitons
the
setting
up
of
the
drill
did
take
much
time
but
it
was
done
with
a
great
deal
of
care
he
set
the
tube
in
the
center
of
the
quadrilateral
formed
by
the
pitons
and
braced
it
in
position
by
attaching
lines
to
the
eyes
on
a
detachable
collar
that
encircled
the
drill
once
the
drill
started
working
it
would
need
bracing
but
until
it
did
it
had
to
be
held
down
all
the
time
he
worked
he
kept
his
eyes
on
his
lines
and
on
his
ship
the
planetoid
was
turning
under
him
which
made
the
ship
appear
to
be
circling
slowly
around
his
worksite
he
had
to
make
sure
that
his
lines
did
get
tangled
or
twisted
while
he
was
working
as
he
set
up
the
bracing
on
the
diameter
drill
he
sang
a
song
that
kipling
might
have
been
startled
to
recognize
to
the
tables
down
at
mory
to
the
place
where
louie
dwells
where
it
always
double
drill
and
no
canteen
sit
the
whiffenpoofs
assembled
with
their
glasses
raised
on
high
and
they
get
a
swig
in
hell
from
gunga
din
when
the
drill
was
firmly
based
on
the
surface
of
the
planetoid
simon
hauled
his
way
back
to
his
ship
along
his
safety
line
inside
he
sat
down
in
the
control
chair
and
backed
well
away
from
the
slowly
spinning
hunk
of
rock
now
there
was
only
one
thin
pair
of
wires
stretching
between
his
ship
and
the
drill
on
the
asteroid
when
he
was
a
good
fifty
meters
away
he
took
one
last
look
to
make
sure
everything
was
as
it
should
be
stand
by
for
a
broadside
standing
by
sir
you
may
fire
when
ready
gridley
aye
sir
rockets
away
his
forefinger
descended
on
a
button
which
sent
a
pulse
of
current
through
the
pair
of
wires
that
trailed
out
the
open
door
to
the
drill
fifty
meters
away
a
flare
of
light
appeared
on
the
top
of
the
drill
almost
immediately
it
developed
into
a
tongue
of
rocket
flame
then
a
glow
appeared
at
the
base
of
the
drill
and
flame
began
to
billow
out
from
beneath
the
tube
the
drill
began
to
sink
into
the
surface
and
the
planetoid
began
to
move
ever
so
slowly
the
drill
was
essentially
a
pair
of
opposed
rockets
the
upper
one
which
tried
to
push
the
drill
into
the
surface
of
the
planetoid
developed
nearly
forty
per
cent
more
thrust
than
the
lower
one
thus
the
lower
one
which
was
trying
to
push
the
drill
the
rock
was
outmatched
it
had
to
back
up
if
possible
and
it
was
certainly
possible
the
exhaust
flame
of
the
lower
rocket
easily
burrowed
a
hole
that
the
rocket
could
back
into
while
the
silicate
rock
boiled
and
vaporized
in
order
to
get
out
of
the
way
soon
there
was
no
sign
of
the
drill
body
itself
there
was
only
a
small
volcano
spewing
up
gas
and
liquid
from
a
hole
in
the
rock
on
the
surface
of
a
planet
the
drill
would
have
built
up
a
little
volcanic
cone
around
the
lip
of
the
hole
but
building
a
cone
like
that
requires
enough
gravity
to
pull
the
hot
matter
back
to
the
edge
of
the
hole
the
fireworks
did
last
long
the
drill
was
built
to
go
in
too
deep
a
drill
of
that
type
could
be
built
which
would
burrow
its
way
right
through
a
small
planetoid
but
that
was
hardly
necessary
for
planting
an
anchor
ten
meters
was
quite
enough
now
came
the
hard
work
on
the
outside
of
the
locked
into
place
was
a
thirty
feet
long
and
eight
inches
in
diameter
there
had
been
ten
of
them
just
as
there
had
been
ten
drills
in
the
storage
locker
now
the
last
drill
had
been
used
and
there
was
but
one
left
the
would
have
to
go
back
for
more
supplies
after
this
job
the
anchor
bolts
had
a
mass
of
four
metric
tons
each
maneuvering
them
around
even
when
they
were
practically
weightless
was
no
easy
job
simon
again
matched
the
velocity
of
the
with
that
of
the
planetoid
which
had
been
accelerated
by
the
drill
action
he
positioned
the
ship
above
the
hole
which
had
been
drilled
into
the
huge
rock
not
directly
above
it
rocket
drills
had
been
known
to
show
spurts
of
life
after
they
were
supposed
to
be
dead
simon
had
timed
the
drill
and
it
had
apparently
behaved
as
it
should
but
there
was
no
need
to
take
chances
fire
brigade
stand
by
fire
brigade
standing
by
sir
a
nozzle
came
out
of
the
nose
of
the
and
peeped
over
the
rim
of
the
hole
ready
aim
squirt
a
jet
of
fluosilicone
oil
shot
down
the
shaft
when
it
had
finished
its
work
there
was
little
possibility
that
anything
could
happen
at
the
bottom
any
unburned
rocket
fuel
would
have
a
hard
time
catching
fire
with
that
stuff
soaking
into
it
ready
to
lower
the
boom
mr
christian
bellowed
simon
aye
sir
ready
sir
lower
away
his
fingers
played
rapidly
over
the
control
board
outside
the
ship
the
lower
end
of
the
great
was
released
from
its
clamp
and
a
small
piston
gave
it
a
little
shove
in
a
long
slow
graceful
arc
it
swung
away
from
the
hull
swiveling
around
the
pivot
clamp
that
held
the
eye
the
braking
effect
of
the
pivot
clamp
was
precisely
set
to
stop
the
when
it
was
at
right
angles
to
the
hull
moving
carefully
simon
maneuvered
the
ship
until
the
far
end
of
the
bolt
was
directly
over
the
shaft
then
he
nudged
the
sideways
pushing
the
bolt
down
into
the
planetoid
it
grated
a
couple
of
times
but
between
the
power
of
the
ship
and
the
mass
of
the
planetoid
there
was
enough
pressure
to
push
it
past
the
obstacles
the
rocket
drill
and
the
had
been
designed
to
work
together
the
hole
made
by
the
first
was
only
a
trifle
larger
than
the
second
the
anchor
settled
firmly
into
place
simon
released
the
clamps
that
held
the
to
the
hull
of
the
ship
and
backed
away
again
as
he
did
a
power
cord
unreeled
for
the
was
still
connected
to
the
vessel
electrically
several
meters
away
simon
pushed
another
button
there
was
no
sound
but
his
practiced
eye
saw
the
eye
of
the
anchor
quiver
a
small
explosive
charge
set
in
the
buried
end
of
the
anchor
had
detonated
expanding
the
far
end
of
the
bolt
wedging
it
firmly
in
the
hole
at
the
same
time
a
piston
had
been
forced
up
a
small
shaft
in
the
center
of
the
bolt
forcing
a
catalyst
to
mix
with
a
resin
and
extruding
the
mixture
out
through
half
a
dozen
holes
in
the
side
of
the
bolt
when
the
stuff
set
the
anchor
was
locked
securely
to
the
sides
of
the
shaft
and
thus
to
the
planetoid
itself
simon
waited
for
a
few
minutes
to
make
sure
the
resin
had
set
completely
then
he
clambered
outside
again
and
attached
a
heavy
towing
cable
to
the
eye
of
the
anchor
which
projected
above
the
surface
of
the
asteroid
back
inside
the
ship
again
he
slowly
applied
power
the
cable
straightened
and
pulled
at
the
anchor
as
the
tried
to
get
away
from
the
asteroid
jules
old
bunion
he
said
as
he
watched
the
needle
of
the
tension
gauge
we
have
set
her
well
yes
so
it
would
appear
simon
cut
the
power
very
good
jules
now
we
shall
see
if
the
beeper
is
functioning
as
it
should
he
flipped
a
switch
that
turned
on
the
finder
pickup
then
turned
the
selector
to
his
own
frequency
band
said
the
radio
importantly
the
explosion
had
also
triggered
on
a
small
but
powerful
transmitter
built
into
the
anchor
the
tugs
would
be
able
to
find
the
planetoid
by
following
the
beeps
ah
jules
success
yes
success
for
the
tenth
time
in
a
row
this
trip
and
how
many
trips
does
this
make
ah
but
who
counting
think
of
the
money
and
the
monotony
to
say
nothing
of
molasses
muchness
and
other
things
that
begin
with
an
quite
so
jules
quite
so
well
let
detach
the
towing
cable
and
be
on
our
way
whither
vesta
i
rather
thought
pallas
this
time
old
thimble
still
vesta
pallas
jules
vesta
hum
hi
ho
said
captain
simon
thoughtfully
pallas
the
argument
continued
while
the
tow
cable
was
detached
from
the
anchor
and
while
the
air
was
being
let
back
into
the
control
chamber
and
while
simon
divested
himself
of
his
suit
actually
although
he
would
like
to
go
to
vesta
it
was
out
of
the
question
energywise
and
timewise
pallas
was
much
closer
he
settled
back
in
the
bucket
seat
and
shot
toward
pallas
edway
tarnhorst
was
from
san
pedro
greater
los
angeles
california
earth
he
was
a
businessman
of
executive
rank
and
was
fairly
rich
in
his
left
lapel
was
the
magistral
knight
cross
of
the
sovereign
hierosolymitan
order
of
malta
reproduced
in
miniature
in
his
wallet
was
a
card
identifying
him
as
a
representative
of
the
constituency
of
southern
california
to
the
supreme
congress
of
the
people
of
the
united
nations
of
earth
he
was
just
past
his
birthday
and
his
lean
ascetic
face
and
graying
hair
gave
him
a
look
of
saintly
wisdom
aside
from
the
cross
in
his
lapel
the
only
ornamentation
or
jewelry
he
wore
consisted
of
a
small
exquisitely
thin
gold
watch
on
his
left
wrist
and
on
the
ring
finger
of
his
left
hand
a
gold
signet
ring
set
with
a
single
flat
unfaceted
diamond
which
was
delicately
engraved
with
the
tarnhorst
coat
of
arms
his
clothing
was
quietly
but
impressively
expensive
and
under
earth
gravity
would
probably
have
draped
impeccably
but
it
tended
to
fluff
oddly
away
from
his
body
under
a
only
a
twentieth
of
earth
he
sat
in
his
chair
with
both
feet
planted
firmly
on
the
metal
floor
and
his
hands
gripping
the
armrests
as
though
he
were
afraid
he
might
float
off
toward
the
ceiling
if
he
let
go
but
only
his
body
betrayed
his
unease
his
face
was
impassive
and
calm
the
man
sitting
next
to
him
looked
a
great
deal
more
comfortable
this
was
peter
danley
who
was
twenty
years
younger
than
tarnhorst
and
looked
it
instead
of
the
clothing
that
the
older
man
was
wearing
he
was
wearing
the
tights
that
were
the
common
dress
of
the
belt
cities
his
hair
was
cropped
close
and
the
fine
blond
strands
made
a
sort
of
golden
halo
about
his
head
when
the
light
from
the
panels
overhead
shone
on
them
his
eyes
were
pale
blue
and
the
lashes
and
eyebrows
were
so
light
as
to
be
almost
invisible
that
effect
combined
with
his
almost
lipless
mouth
gave
his
face
a
rather
expressionless
expression
he
carried
himself
like
a
man
who
was
used
to
or
conditions
but
he
talked
like
an
earthman
not
a
belt
man
the
identification
card
in
his
belt
explained
that
he
was
a
pilot
on
the
shuttle
service
in
the
eyes
of
anyone
from
the
belt
cities
he
was
still
an
earthman
not
a
true
spaceman
he
was
looked
upon
in
the
same
way
that
the
captain
of
a
transatlantic
liner
might
have
looked
upon
the
skipper
of
the
staten
island
ferry
two
centuries
before
the
very
fact
that
he
was
seated
in
a
chair
gave
away
his
earth
habits
the
third
man
was
standing
leaning
at
a
slight
angle
so
that
his
back
touched
the
wall
behind
him
he
was
not
tall
five
nine
and
his
face
and
body
were
thin
his
tanned
skin
seemed
to
be
stretched
tightly
over
this
scanty
padding
and
in
places
the
bones
appeared
to
be
trying
to
poke
their
way
through
to
the
surface
his
ears
were
small
and
lay
nearly
flat
against
his
head
and
the
hair
on
his
skull
was
so
sparse
that
the
tanned
scalp
could
be
easily
seen
beneath
it
although
there
was
no
actual
bald
spot
anywhere
only
his
large
luminous
brown
eyes
showed
that
nature
had
not
skimped
on
everything
when
he
was
formed
his
name
was
lettered
neatly
on
the
outside
of
the
door
to
the
office
georges
alhamid
in
spite
of
the
french
spelling
he
pronounced
the
name
george
in
the
english
manner
he
had
welcomed
the
two
earthmen
into
his
office
smiling
the
automatic
smile
of
the
diplomat
as
he
welcomed
them
to
pallas
as
soon
as
they
were
comfortably
seated
though
perhaps
that
word
did
not
exactly
apply
to
edway
tarnhorst
georges
alhamid
said
now
gentlemen
what
can
i
do
for
you
he
asked
it
as
though
he
were
completely
unaware
of
what
had
brought
the
two
men
to
pallas
tarnhorst
looked
as
though
he
were
privately
astonished
that
his
host
could
speak
grammatically
alhamid
he
began
i
do
know
whether
you
aware
that
the
industrial
death
rate
here
in
the
belt
has
been
the
subject
of
a
great
deal
of
discussion
in
both
industrial
and
governmental
circles
on
earth
it
was
a
half
question
and
he
let
it
hang
in
the
air
waiting
to
see
whether
he
got
an
answer
certainly
my
office
has
received
a
great
deal
of
correspondence
on
the
subject
alhamid
said
his
voice
sounded
as
though
tarnhorst
had
mentioned
nothing
more
serious
than
a
commercial
deal
important
but
nothing
to
get
into
a
heavy
sweat
over
tarnhorst
nodded
and
then
held
his
head
very
still
his
actions
betrayed
the
fact
that
he
was
not
used
to
the
messages
his
semicircular
canals
were
sending
his
brain
when
he
moved
his
head
under
low
gee
exactly
he
said
after
a
moment
pause
i
have
copies
of
a
part
of
that
correspondence
to
be
specific
the
correspondence
between
your
office
and
the
workers
union
safety
control
board
and
between
your
office
and
the
workingman
compensation
insurance
corporation
i
see
well
then
you
fully
aware
of
what
our
trouble
is
tarnhorst
i
glad
to
see
that
an
official
of
the
insurance
company
is
taking
an
interest
in
our
troubles
tarnhorst
head
twitched
as
though
he
were
going
to
shake
his
head
and
had
thought
better
of
it
a
fraction
of
a
second
too
late
it
matter
the
fluid
in
his
inner
ears
sloshed
anyway
i
am
not
here
in
my
capacity
as
an
officer
of
the
compensation
insurance
corporation
he
said
carefully
i
am
here
as
a
representative
of
the
people
congress
alhamid
face
showed
a
mild
surprise
which
he
did
not
feel
honored
of
course
tarnhorst
he
said
but
you
must
understand
that
i
am
not
an
official
of
the
government
of
pallas
tarnhorst
ascetic
face
betrayed
nothing
since
you
have
no
unified
government
out
here
he
said
i
can
not
of
course
presume
to
deal
with
you
in
a
governmental
capacity
i
have
spoken
to
the
governor
of
pallas
however
and
he
assures
me
that
you
are
the
man
to
speak
to
if
it
about
the
industrial
death
rate
alhamid
agreed
then
perfectly
correct
but
if
you
here
as
a
governmental
representative
of
earth
i
do
understand
please
alhamid
tarnhorst
interrupted
with
a
touch
of
irritation
in
his
voice
this
is
not
my
first
trip
to
the
belt
nor
my
first
attempt
to
deal
with
the
official
workings
of
the
confederated
cities
alhamid
nodded
gently
it
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
second
trip
beyond
the
martian
orbit
the
first
having
taken
place
some
three
years
before
but
the
complaint
was
common
enough
earth
with
its
strong
centralized
government
simply
could
not
understand
the
functioning
of
the
belt
confederacy
a
man
like
tarnhorst
apparently
could
distinguish
between
and
knowing
that
alhamid
could
confidently
predict
what
the
general
sense
of
next
sentence
would
be
i
am
well
aware
said
tarnhorst
that
the
belt
companies
not
only
have
the
various
governors
under
their
collective
thumb
but
have
thus
far
prevented
the
formation
of
any
kind
of
centralized
government
let
us
not
quibble
alhamid
the
belt
companies
run
the
belt
and
that
means
that
i
must
deal
with
officials
of
those
companies
such
as
yourself
alhamid
felt
it
necessary
to
make
a
mild
speech
in
rebuttal
i
can
not
agree
with
you
tarnhorst
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
government
of
pallas
or
any
of
the
other
asteroids
i
am
neither
an
elected
nor
an
appointed
official
of
any
government
nor
for
that
matter
am
i
an
advisor
in
either
an
official
or
unofficial
capacity
to
any
government
i
do
not
make
the
laws
designed
to
keep
the
peace
nor
do
i
enforce
them
except
in
so
far
as
i
am
a
registered
voter
and
therefore
have
some
voice
in
those
laws
in
that
respect
nor
again
do
i
serve
any
judiciary
function
in
any
belt
government
except
inasmuch
as
i
may
be
called
upon
for
jury
duty
i
am
a
business
executive
tarnhorst
nothing
more
if
you
have
governmental
problems
to
discuss
then
i
ca
help
you
since
i
not
authorized
to
make
any
decisions
for
any
government
edway
tarnhorst
closed
his
eyes
and
massaged
the
bridge
of
his
thin
nose
between
thumb
and
forefinger
i
understand
that
i
understand
that
perfectly
but
out
here
the
companies
have
taken
over
certain
functions
of
government
shall
we
say
shall
we
say
rather
that
on
earth
the
government
has
usurped
certain
functions
which
rightfully
belong
to
private
enterprise
alhamid
said
gently
historically
i
think
that
is
the
correct
view
tarnhorst
opened
his
eyes
and
smiled
you
may
be
quite
correct
historically
speaking
perhaps
the
earth
government
has
usurped
the
functions
that
rightfully
belong
to
kings
dictators
and
warlords
to
say
nothing
of
local
satraps
and
petty
chieftains
perhaps
we
should
return
to
that
perhaps
we
should
return
to
the
human
suffering
that
was
endemic
in
those
times
you
might
try
it
said
alhamid
with
a
straight
face
say
one
year
out
of
every
ten
it
would
give
the
people
something
to
look
forward
to
with
anticipation
and
to
look
back
upon
with
nostalgia
then
he
changed
his
tone
if
you
wish
to
debate
theories
of
government
tarnhorst
possibly
we
could
get
up
a
couple
of
teams
make
a
public
affair
of
it
it
could
be
taped
and
televised
here
and
on
earth
and
we
could
charge
royalties
on
each
peter
danley
blond
blank
face
became
suddenly
animated
he
looked
as
though
he
were
trying
to
suppress
a
laugh
he
almost
succeeded
it
came
out
as
a
cough
at
the
same
time
tarnhorst
interrupted
alhamid
you
have
made
your
point
alhamid
he
said
in
a
brittle
voice
permit
me
to
make
mine
i
have
come
to
discuss
business
with
you
but
as
a
member
of
the
congressional
committee
for
industrial
welfare
i
am
also
in
search
of
facts
proper
legislation
requires
facts
and
legislation
passed
by
the
congress
will
depend
to
a
great
extent
upon
the
report
on
my
findings
here
i
understand
said
alhamid
i
certainly
be
happy
to
provide
you
with
whatever
data
you
want
with
the
exception
of
data
on
industrial
processes
of
course
that
not
mine
to
give
but
anything
else
he
gestured
with
one
hand
opening
it
palm
upwards
as
though
dispensing
a
gift
i
not
interested
in
industrial
secrets
said
tarnhorst
somewhat
mollified
it
a
matter
of
the
welfare
of
your
workers
we
feel
that
we
should
do
something
to
help
as
you
know
there
have
been
protests
from
the
worker
union
safety
control
board
and
from
the
compensation
insurance
corporation
alhamid
nodded
i
know
the
insurance
company
is
complaining
about
the
high
rate
of
claims
for
deaths
they
threatened
to
raise
our
premium
rates
considering
the
expense
do
you
as
a
businessman
think
that
a
fair
thing
to
do
no
alhamid
said
i
have
pointed
out
to
them
that
the
total
amount
of
the
claims
is
far
less
per
capita
than
for
instance
the
steel
construction
workers
union
of
earth
granted
there
are
more
death
claims
but
these
are
more
than
compensated
for
by
the
fact
that
the
claims
for
disability
and
hospitalization
are
almost
negligible
that
another
thing
we
do
understand
tarnhorst
said
carefully
it
appears
that
not
only
are
the
safety
precautions
insufficient
but
the
care
is
er
inefficient
i
assure
you
that
what
care
there
is
alhamid
said
is
quite
efficient
but
there
is
a
high
mortality
rate
because
of
the
very
nature
of
the
job
do
you
know
anything
about
mr
tarnhorst
very
little
tarnhorst
admitted
that
is
one
of
the
things
i
am
here
to
get
information
on
you
used
the
phrase
care
there
is
just
how
do
you
mean
that
tarnhorst
when
a
man
is
out
in
space
completely
surrounded
by
a
hard
vacuum
accident
is
very
likely
to
be
fatal
on
earth
if
a
man
sticks
his
thumb
in
a
punch
press
he
loses
his
thumb
out
here
if
a
man
thumb
is
crushed
off
while
he
in
space
he
loses
his
air
and
his
life
long
before
he
can
bleed
to
death
anything
that
disables
a
man
in
space
is
deadly
times
out
of
a
hundred
i
can
give
you
a
parallel
case
in
the
early
days
of
oil
drilling
wells
occasionally
caught
fire
one
of
the
ways
to
put
them
out
was
to
literally
blow
them
out
with
a
charge
of
nitroglycerine
naturally
the
nitroglycerine
had
to
be
transported
from
where
it
was
made
to
where
it
was
to
be
used
sensibly
enough
it
was
not
transported
in
lots
it
was
carried
in
small
special
containers
by
a
single
man
in
an
automobile
who
used
the
back
roads
and
avoided
traffic
and
stayed
away
from
thickly
populated
areas
which
was
possible
in
those
days
in
many
places
these
carriers
were
required
to
paint
their
cars
red
and
have
the
words
painted
on
the
vehicle
in
yellow
now
the
interesting
thing
about
that
situation
is
that
whereas
insurance
companies
in
those
days
were
reluctant
to
give
policies
to
those
men
even
at
astronomical
premium
rates
disability
insurance
cost
practically
nothing
provided
the
insured
would
allow
the
insertion
of
a
clause
that
restricted
the
covered
period
to
those
times
when
he
was
actually
engaged
in
transporting
nitroglycerine
you
can
see
why
i
am
not
familiar
with
explosives
tarnhorst
said
i
take
it
that
the
substance
is
er
easily
detonated
that
right
said
alhamid
it
not
only
sensitive
but
unreliable
you
might
actually
drop
a
jar
of
the
stuff
and
do
nothing
but
shatter
the
jar
another
jar
apparently
exactly
similar
might
go
off
because
it
got
jiggled
by
a
seismic
wave
from
a
passing
truck
half
a
mile
away
but
the
latter
was
a
great
deal
more
likely
than
the
former
very
well
said
tarnhorst
after
a
moment
i
accept
that
analogy
like
to
know
more
about
the
work
itself
what
does
the
job
entail
exactly
what
safety
precautions
are
taken
it
required
the
better
part
of
three
hours
to
explain
exactly
what
an
anchor
setter
did
and
how
he
did
it
and
what
safety
precautions
were
being
taken
through
it
all
peter
danley
just
sat
there
listening
saying
nothing
finally
edway
tarnhorst
said
well
thank
you
very
much
for
your
information
alhamid
i
like
to
think
this
over
may
i
see
you
in
the
morning
certainly
sir
you
welcome
at
any
time
thank
you
the
two
earthmen
rose
from
their
seats
tarnhorst
carefully
danley
with
the
ease
of
long
practice
would
nine
in
the
morning
be
convenient
quite
convenient
i
expect
you
danley
glided
over
to
the
door
and
held
it
open
for
tarnhorst
he
was
wearing
magnetic
the
standard
footwear
of
the
belt
which
had
three
in
the
forward
part
of
the
sole
allowing
the
foot
to
move
smoothly
in
any
direction
while
the
rubber
heel
could
be
brought
down
to
act
as
a
brake
when
necessary
he
did
handle
them
with
the
adeptness
of
a
belt
man
but
he
was
too
awkward
tarnhorst
was
wearing
plain
boots
the
type
he
had
no
intention
of
having
his
dignity
compromised
by
shoes
that
might
treacherously
scoot
out
from
under
him
as
soon
as
the
door
had
closed
behind
them
georges
alhamid
picked
up
the
telephone
on
his
desk
and
punched
a
number
when
a
woman
voice
answered
at
the
other
end
he
said
miss
lehman
this
is
alhamid
i
like
to
speak
to
the
governor
there
was
a
pause
then
george
larry
here
alhamid
leaned
back
comfortably
against
the
wall
i
just
saw
your
guests
larry
i
spent
damn
near
three
hours
explaining
why
it
was
necessary
to
put
anchors
in
rocks
how
it
was
done
and
why
it
was
dangerous
did
you
convince
him
tarnhorst
i
mean
i
doubt
it
oh
i
do
mean
he
thinks
i
lying
or
anything
like
that
he
too
sharp
for
that
but
he
convinced
that
we
negligent
that
we
a
bunch
of
barbarians
who
care
nothing
about
human
life
you
got
to
unconvince
him
george
the
governor
said
worriedly
the
belt
still
is
enough
to
be
able
to
afford
an
earth
embargo
they
can
hold
out
longer
than
we
can
i
know
alhamid
said
give
us
another
generation
and
we
can
tell
the
world
welfare
state
where
to
head
in
but
right
now
things
are
touchy
and
you
and
i
are
in
the
big
fat
middle
of
it
he
paused
rubbing
thoughtfully
at
his
lean
blade
of
a
nose
with
a
bony
forefinger
larry
what
did
you
think
of
that
blond
nonentity
tarnhorst
brought
with
him
he
not
a
nonentity
the
governor
objected
gently
he
just
looks
it
he
tarnhorst
on
space
industry
if
you
want
my
opinion
did
he
say
much
of
anything
while
he
was
with
you
hardly
anything
same
here
i
have
a
feeling
that
his
job
is
to
evaluate
every
word
you
say
and
report
his
evaluation
to
tarnhorst
you
have
to
be
careful
i
agree
alhamid
said
but
he
complicates
things
i
have
a
feeling
that
if
i
tell
tarnhorst
a
straight
story
he
believe
it
he
seems
to
be
a
pretty
shrewd
judge
but
danley
just
might
be
the
case
of
the
man
who
is
dangerous
because
of
his
little
learning
he
obviously
knows
a
devil
of
a
lot
more
about
operations
in
space
than
tarnhorst
does
and
he
evidently
a
man
so
that
tarnhorst
will
value
his
opinion
but
it
evident
that
danley
does
know
anything
about
space
by
our
standards
put
him
out
on
a
boat
as
an
anchor
man
and
he
be
lucky
if
he
set
a
single
anchor
well
there
not
much
chance
of
that
how
do
you
mean
dangerous
i
give
you
a
suppose
you
got
a
complex
circuit
using
alternatic
current
and
you
trying
to
explain
to
a
reasonably
intelligent
man
how
it
works
and
what
it
does
if
he
does
know
anything
about
electricity
he
might
understand
the
explanation
but
he
believe
that
you
telling
him
the
truth
even
if
he
understand
it
but
if
he
knows
the
basic
theory
of
direct
currents
you
likely
to
find
yourself
in
trouble
because
he
know
just
enough
to
see
that
what
you
telling
him
does
jibe
with
what
he
already
knows
volts
times
amperes
equal
watts
as
far
as
he
concerned
and
the
term
factor
does
nothing
but
confuse
him
he
knows
that
copper
is
a
conductor
so
he
ca
see
how
a
current
could
be
cut
off
by
a
choke
coil
he
knows
that
a
current
ca
pass
through
an
insulator
so
a
condenser
obviously
ca
be
what
you
say
it
is
mentally
he
tags
you
as
a
liar
and
he
begins
to
try
to
dig
in
to
see
how
your
gadget
works
i
see
what
you
mean
bad
he
snorted
blast
earthmen
anyway
have
you
ever
been
there
earth
nope
by
careful
i
managed
to
forego
that
pleasure
so
far
larry
why
brrr
it
the
feel
of
the
place
that
i
ca
stand
i
do
mean
the
constant
i
take
my
daily
exercise
spin
in
the
centrifuge
just
like
anyone
else
and
you
soon
get
used
to
the
steady
pull
on
earth
i
mean
the
constant
oppressive
tension
if
you
see
what
i
mean
the
feeling
that
everyone
hates
and
distrusts
everyone
else
the
curious
impression
of
fear
underneath
every
word
and
action
i
older
than
you
are
george
and
i
lived
with
a
kind
of
fear
all
my
life
just
as
you
and
everyone
else
in
the
belt
has
a
single
mistake
can
kill
out
here
and
the
fear
that
it
will
be
some
fool
who
makes
a
mistake
that
will
kill
hundreds
is
always
with
us
we
learned
to
live
with
that
kind
of
fear
we
learned
to
take
steps
to
prevent
any
idiot
from
throwing
the
wrong
switch
that
would
shut
down
a
power
plant
or
open
an
air
lock
at
the
wrong
time
but
the
fear
on
earth
is
different
it
the
fear
that
everyone
else
is
out
to
get
you
the
fear
that
someone
will
stick
a
figurative
knife
in
your
back
and
reduce
you
to
the
basic
subsistence
level
and
that
fear
is
solidly
based
believe
me
the
only
way
to
climb
up
from
basic
subsistence
is
to
climb
over
everyone
else
to
knock
aside
those
in
your
way
to
get
rid
of
whoever
is
occupying
the
position
you
want
and
once
you
get
there
the
only
way
you
can
hold
your
position
is
to
make
sure
that
nobody
below
you
gets
too
big
for
his
britches
the
rule
is
pull
down
those
above
you
hold
down
those
below
you
i
seen
it
george
the
big
cities
are
packed
with
people
whose
sole
ambition
in
life
is
to
badger
their
local
welfare
worker
out
of
another
check
they
need
new
clothes
they
need
a
new
bed
they
need
a
new
table
they
need
more
food
for
the
new
baby
they
need
this
they
need
that
all
they
ever
do
is
but
of
course
they
far
to
aristocratic
to
those
who
do
have
ambition
have
to
become
politicians
in
the
worst
sense
of
the
word
they
have
to
gain
some
measure
of
control
over
the
dispersal
of
largesse
to
the
mob
they
have
to
get
themselves
into
a
position
where
they
can
give
away
other
people
money
so
that
they
can
get
their
cut
too
and
even
then
the
man
who
gets
to
be
a
big
shot
does
dare
show
it
take
a
look
at
tarnhorst
he
probably
one
of
the
best
of
a
bad
lot
he
has
his
fingers
in
a
lot
of
business
pies
which
make
him
money
and
in
a
high
enough
position
in
the
government
to
enable
him
to
keep
some
of
his
money
but
his
clothing
is
only
a
little
bit
better
than
the
average
just
as
the
man
who
is
on
basic
subsistence
wears
clothes
that
are
only
a
little
bit
worse
than
the
average
that
diamond
ring
of
his
is
a
real
diamond
but
you
can
buy
imitations
that
ca
be
told
from
the
real
thing
except
by
an
expert
so
his
diamond
does
offend
anyone
by
being
ostentatious
and
it
unfaceted
to
eliminate
offensive
flash
all
the
color
has
gone
out
of
life
on
earth
george
women
held
out
longer
than
men
did
but
now
no
man
or
woman
would
be
caught
wearing
a
suit
you
do
see
any
reds
or
yellows
or
blues
or
greens
or
oranges
only
grays
and
browns
and
black
it
not
for
me
george
i
much
rather
live
in
fear
of
the
few
fools
who
might
pull
a
stupid
trick
that
would
kill
me
than
live
in
the
constant
fear
of
everyone
around
me
who
all
want
to
destroy
me
deliberately
i
know
what
you
mean
said
alhamid
but
i
think
you
put
the
wrong
label
on
what
you
calling
there
a
difference
between
fear
and
having
a
healthy
respect
for
something
that
is
dangerous
but
not
malignant
that
vacuum
out
there
is
out
to
anybody
the
only
people
it
kills
are
the
fools
who
have
no
respect
for
it
and
the
neurotics
who
think
that
it
wants
to
murder
them
you
neither
and
i
know
it
the
governor
laughed
that
the
advantage
we
have
over
earthmen
george
we
went
through
the
same
school
of
hard
knocks
together
all
of
us
and
we
know
how
we
stack
up
against
each
other
true
alhamid
said
darkly
but
how
long
will
that
hold
if
tarnhorst
closes
the
school
down
that
what
you
got
to
prevent
said
the
governor
flatly
if
you
need
help
yell
i
will
alhamid
said
very
loudly
he
hung
up
wishing
he
knew
what
tarnhorst
and
danley
had
in
mind
the
trouble
with
these
people
danley
said
edway
tarnhorst
is
that
they
have
no
respect
whatever
for
human
dignity
they
have
a
tendency
to
overlook
the
basic
rights
of
the
individual
they
certainly
different
peter
danley
said
tarnhorst
juggled
himself
up
and
down
on
the
in
which
he
was
seated
as
though
he
could
hardly
believe
that
he
had
weight
again
he
hated
low
gee
it
made
him
feel
awkward
and
undignified
the
only
thing
that
reminded
him
that
this
was
not
real
gravity
was
the
faint
but
hum
of
the
huge
engines
that
drove
the
big
centrifuge
the
rooms
had
cost
more
but
they
were
well
worth
it
as
far
as
tarnhorst
was
concerned
how
do
you
mean
he
asked
almost
absently
settling
himself
comfortably
into
the
cushions
i
do
know
exactly
there
a
hardness
a
toughness
i
ca
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
but
it
in
the
way
they
act
the
way
they
talk
surely
you
noticed
that
before
tarnhorst
asked
in
mild
surprise
you
met
these
belt
men
on
luna
and
their
women
danley
said
with
a
nod
but
the
impact
is
somewhat
more
pronounced
on
their
own
home
ground
seeing
them
their
women
tarnhorst
said
caught
by
the
phrase
birds
giggling
children
and
no
more
morals
than
a
common
oh
they
not
as
bad
as
all
that
danley
objected
their
clothing
is
a
little
bright
i
admit
and
they
laugh
and
kid
around
a
lot
but
i
would
say
that
their
morals
were
any
worse
than
those
of
a
girl
from
new
york
or
london
arrogance
is
the
word
said
tarnhorst
arrogance
like
the
way
that
alhamid
kept
standing
all
the
time
we
were
talking
towering
over
us
that
way
just
habit
danley
said
when
you
do
weigh
more
than
six
or
seven
pounds
there
not
much
point
in
sitting
down
besides
it
leaves
them
on
their
feet
in
case
of
emergency
he
could
have
sat
down
out
of
politeness
tarnhorst
said
but
no
they
try
to
put
on
an
air
of
superiority
that
is
offensive
to
human
dignity
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
stretched
out
his
legs
and
crossed
his
ankles
however
attitude
itself
need
concern
us
until
it
translates
itself
into
behavior
what
can
not
be
tolerated
is
this
callous
attitude
toward
the
dignity
and
of
the
workers
out
here
what
did
you
think
of
alhamid
explanation
of
this
business
danley
hesitated
it
sounded
straightforward
enough
as
far
as
it
went
you
think
he
concealing
something
then
i
do
know
i
do
have
all
the
information
he
frowned
putting
furrows
between
his
almost
invisible
blond
brows
i
know
that
neither
government
business
nor
insurance
business
are
my
specialty
but
i
would
like
to
know
a
little
more
about
the
background
before
i
render
any
decision
well
tarnhorst
frowned
in
thought
for
a
moment
then
came
to
a
decision
i
ca
give
you
the
detailed
data
of
course
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
people
mutual
welfare
code
but
i
can
give
you
the
general
story
i
just
want
to
know
what
sort
of
thing
to
look
for
danley
said
certainly
certainly
well
tarnhorst
paused
to
collect
his
thoughts
then
launched
into
his
speech
it
has
now
been
over
eighty
years
since
the
first
colonists
came
out
here
to
the
belt
at
first
the
ties
with
earth
were
quite
strong
naturally
only
a
few
actually
intended
to
stay
out
there
the
rest
of
their
lives
most
of
them
intended
to
make
themselves
a
nice
little
nest
egg
come
back
home
and
retire
at
the
same
time
the
world
state
was
slowly
evolving
from
its
original
loosely
tied
group
of
independent
nations
toward
what
it
is
today
the
people
who
came
out
here
were
mostly
misfits
sociologically
speaking
he
smiled
sardonically
they
have
changed
much
at
any
rate
as
i
said
they
were
strongly
tied
to
earth
there
was
the
matter
of
food
air
and
equipment
all
of
which
had
to
be
shipped
out
from
earth
to
begin
with
only
the
tremendous
supply
of
metal
almost
free
for
the
taking
made
such
a
venture
commercially
possible
within
years
however
the
various
industrial
concerns
that
managed
the
belt
mining
had
become
the
robot
scoopers
which
are
used
to
mine
methane
and
ammonia
from
jupiter
atmosphere
gave
them
plenty
of
organic
raw
material
now
they
grow
plants
of
all
kinds
and
even
raise
food
animals
they
began
as
every
misfit
does
to
complain
about
the
taxes
the
government
put
on
their
incomes
the
government
in
my
opinion
made
an
error
back
then
they
wanted
to
keep
people
out
in
the
belt
since
the
mines
on
earth
were
not
only
rapidly
being
depleted
but
the
mining
sites
were
needed
for
living
space
besides
asteroid
metals
were
cheaper
than
metals
mined
on
earth
to
induce
the
colonists
to
remain
in
the
belt
no
income
tax
was
levied
the
income
tax
was
replaced
by
an
eighty
per
cent
tax
on
the
savings
accumulated
when
the
colonist
returned
to
earth
to
retire
they
resented
even
that
it
was
explained
to
them
that
the
asteroids
were
after
all
natural
resources
and
that
they
had
no
moral
right
to
make
a
large
profit
and
deprive
others
of
their
fair
share
of
the
income
from
a
natural
resource
but
they
insisted
that
they
had
earned
it
and
had
a
right
to
keep
it
in
other
words
the
then
government
bribed
them
to
stay
out
here
and
the
bribe
was
more
effective
than
they
had
intended
so
they
stayed
out
here
and
kept
their
money
danley
said
exactly
at
that
time
if
you
will
recall
there
was
a
great
deal
of
agitation
against
colonialism
there
had
been
for
a
long
time
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
agitation
was
directed
against
certain
industrialist
nations
who
had
enslaved
the
populace
of
parts
of
asia
and
africa
solely
to
produce
wealth
and
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
themselves
but
the
belt
operators
took
advantage
of
the
anticolonialism
of
the
times
and
declared
that
the
belt
cities
were
and
by
right
ought
to
be
free
and
independent
political
entities
it
was
a
ridiculous
assumption
of
course
but
since
the
various
belt
cities
were
at
that
time
under
the
nominal
control
of
three
or
four
of
the
larger
nations
the
political
picture
required
that
they
be
allowed
to
declare
themselves
independent
it
was
not
anticipated
at
the
time
that
they
would
be
so
resistant
toward
the
world
government
he
smiled
slightly
of
course
by
refusing
to
send
representatives
to
the
people
congress
they
have
in
effect
cut
themselves
off
from
any
voice
in
human
government
then
he
shrugged
at
the
moment
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
what
interests
us
at
the
moment
is
the
death
rate
curve
of
the
or
whatever
they
are
did
you
know
that
it
is
practically
impossible
for
anyone
to
get
a
job
out
there
in
the
belt
unless
he
has
had
experience
in
the
field
no
danley
admitted
it
true
for
every
other
job
they
want
only
men
with
space
experience
and
by
experience
they
mean
because
that
the
only
job
a
man
can
get
without
previous
space
experience
they
spend
six
months
in
a
special
school
learning
to
do
the
work
according
to
our
friend
georges
alhamid
then
they
are
sent
out
to
set
anchors
small
ones
at
first
in
rocks
only
a
few
meters
in
diameter
then
larger
ones
after
a
year
or
so
at
that
kind
of
work
they
can
apply
for
more
lucrative
positions
i
see
nothing
intrinsically
wrong
in
that
i
will
admit
but
the
indications
are
that
the
schooling
which
should
have
been
getting
more
efficient
over
the
years
has
evidently
been
getting
more
lax
the
death
rate
has
gone
up
just
a
minute
danley
interrupted
do
you
mean
that
a
man
has
to
have
what
they
call
experience
before
he
can
get
kind
of
job
tarnhorst
shook
his
head
and
was
pleased
to
find
that
no
nausea
resulted
no
of
course
not
clerical
jobs
teaching
jobs
and
the
like
do
require
that
sort
of
training
but
there
very
little
chance
for
advancement
unless
you
one
of
the
elite
a
physician
for
example
would
have
many
patients
unless
he
had
had
experience
he
would
be
allowed
to
own
or
drive
a
space
boat
and
he
would
be
allowed
to
go
anywhere
near
what
are
called
areas
such
as
air
locks
power
plants
or
heavy
industry
installations
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
they
have
a
very
strong
union
said
danley
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
yes
tarnhorst
said
anything
that
has
anything
to
do
with
operations
in
space
requires
that
sort
of
experience
and
there
are
very
few
jobs
out
here
that
can
avoid
having
anything
to
do
with
space
space
is
only
a
few
kilometers
away
the
expression
on
his
face
showed
that
he
did
much
care
for
the
thought
i
do
see
that
that
so
bad
danley
said
going
out
there
something
for
the
unexperienced
a
man
who
does
know
what
he
doing
can
get
himself
killed
easily
and
what
worse
he
likely
to
take
others
with
him
you
speak
of
course
from
experience
tarnhorst
said
with
no
trace
of
sarcasm
i
accept
that
by
not
allowing
inexperienced
persons
in
critical
areas
the
belt
companies
are
at
least
indirectly
looking
out
for
the
welfare
of
the
people
but
we
must
delude
ourselves
into
thinking
that
that
is
their
prime
objective
these
belt
companies
are
no
better
than
the
giants
of
the
nineteenth
and
twentieth
centuries
the
government
here
is
farcical
the
sole
job
is
to
prevent
crime
and
to
adjudicate
small
civil
cases
every
other
function
of
proper
government
the
organization
of
industry
the
regulation
of
standards
the
subsidizing
of
research
the
control
of
prices
and
so
on
are
left
to
the
belt
companies
or
to
the
people
the
belt
cities
are
no
more
than
what
used
to
be
called
towns
i
understand
that
danley
said
but
they
seem
to
function
fairly
smoothly
tarnhorst
eyed
him
if
by
functioning
you
mean
the
denial
of
the
common
rights
of
human
freedom
and
dignity
yes
oh
they
give
their
sop
to
such
basic
human
needs
as
the
right
of
every
individual
to
be
respected
but
only
because
earth
has
put
pressure
on
them
otherwise
people
who
through
no
fault
of
their
own
were
unable
to
work
or
get
experience
would
be
unable
to
get
jobs
and
would
be
looked
down
upon
as
pariahs
you
mean
there
are
people
here
who
have
no
jobs
i
would
think
that
unemployment
would
be
a
problem
out
here
it
is
said
tarnhorst
yet
but
there
are
always
those
unfortunates
who
are
psychologically
incapable
of
work
and
society
must
provide
for
them
the
belt
cities
provide
for
a
basic
education
of
course
as
long
as
a
person
is
going
to
school
he
is
given
a
stipend
but
a
person
who
has
neither
the
ability
to
work
nor
the
ability
to
study
is
an
outcast
even
though
he
is
provided
for
by
the
companies
he
is
forced
to
do
something
to
earn
what
should
be
his
by
right
he
is
given
menial
and
degrading
tasks
to
do
we
would
like
to
put
a
stop
to
that
sort
of
thing
but
we
ah
have
no
ah
means
of
doing
so
he
paused
as
though
considering
whether
he
had
said
too
much
the
problem
at
hand
he
went
on
hurriedly
is
the
death
curve
when
this
technique
for
taking
the
rocks
to
the
smelters
was
being
worked
out
the
death
rate
was
as
you
might
imagine
quite
high
the
belt
companies
had
already
been
operating
out
here
for
a
long
time
before
the
stony
meteorites
were
mined
commercially
at
first
the
big
thing
was
that
what
they
came
here
to
get
in
the
beginning
where
most
of
the
money
still
is
but
the
stony
asteroids
provide
them
with
their
oxygen
this
technique
was
worked
out
at
a
time
when
the
belt
companies
were
trying
to
find
ways
to
make
the
belt
after
they
got
the
technique
worked
out
so
that
it
operated
smoothly
the
death
rate
dropped
down
it
stayed
down
for
a
little
while
and
then
began
to
rise
again
it
has
nearly
reached
an
high
obviously
something
is
wrong
and
we
have
to
find
out
what
it
is
danley
scratched
ruminatively
behind
his
right
ear
and
wished
he
had
the
opportunity
to
study
history
he
had
been
vaguely
aware
of
the
broad
outlines
but
the
details
had
never
been
brought
to
his
attention
before
suppose
alhamid
trying
to
hide
something
he
said
after
a
moment
what
would
it
be
do
you
think
tarnhorst
shrugged
and
spread
his
hands
what
could
it
be
but
some
sort
of
scheme
inferior
materials
being
used
at
a
critical
spot
perhaps
skimping
on
quality
or
quantity
somewhere
somehow
they
are
shaving
costs
at
the
risk
of
the
workers
lives
we
have
to
find
out
what
it
is
peter
danley
nodded
do
danley
thought
to
himself
i
the
one
who
going
to
have
to
go
out
there
and
find
it
while
you
sit
here
he
felt
that
there
was
a
pretty
good
chance
that
these
belt
operators
might
kill
him
to
keep
him
from
finding
out
what
it
was
they
were
saving
money
on
aloud
he
said
i
do
what
i
can
mr
tarnhorst
tarnhorst
smiled
i
certain
you
will
that
why
i
needed
someone
who
knows
more
about
this
business
than
i
and
when
we
do
find
it
what
then
then
why
then
we
will
force
them
to
make
the
proper
changes
or
there
will
be
trouble
georges
alhamid
heard
the
whole
conversation
early
the
next
morning
the
governor
himself
brought
the
recording
over
to
his
office
do
you
think
he
knew
he
was
being
overheard
the
governor
shrugged
who
knows
he
waltzed
all
around
what
he
was
trying
to
say
but
that
may
have
been
just
native
caution
or
he
may
not
want
danley
to
know
what
on
his
mind
how
could
he
bring
danley
out
here
without
telling
him
anything
beforehand
alhamid
asked
thoughtfully
is
danley
really
that
ignorant
or
was
the
whole
conversation
for
our
ears
i
inclined
to
think
that
danley
really
did
know
remember
george
the
best
way
to
hold
down
the
ones
below
you
is
to
keep
them
from
gaining
any
knowledge
to
keep
data
out
of
their
hands
except
for
the
carefully
doctored
data
you
want
them
to
have
i
know
alhamid
said
history
is
exactly
a
popular
subject
on
earth
he
tapped
his
fingers
gently
on
the
case
of
the
playback
and
looked
at
it
as
if
he
were
trying
to
read
the
minds
of
the
persons
who
had
spoken
the
words
he
had
just
heard
i
really
think
he
believed
that
his
nullifying
equipment
was
doing
its
job
the
governor
continued
he
would
have
any
way
of
knowing
we
could
counteract
it
alhamid
shrugged
it
does
matter
much
we
still
have
to
assume
that
he
primarily
out
to
bring
the
belt
cities
under
earth
control
to
do
that
all
he
have
to
do
is
find
something
that
could
be
built
up
into
a
scandal
on
earth
not
george
the
governor
said
it
would
take
a
lot
more
than
that
alone
but
it
would
certainly
be
a
start
in
the
right
direction
one
thing
we
do
know
alhamid
said
is
that
nobody
on
earth
will
allow
any
action
against
the
belt
unless
popular
sentiment
is
definitely
against
us
as
long
as
we
are
apparently
people
all
right
i
wonder
why
tarnhorst
is
so
anxious
to
get
us
under
the
thumb
of
the
people
congress
is
it
purely
that
idealism
of
his
mostly
he
has
the
notion
that
everybody
has
a
right
to
be
accorded
the
respect
of
his
fellow
man
and
that
that
right
is
something
that
every
person
is
automatically
given
at
birth
not
something
he
has
to
earn
what
gave
him
his
particular
gripe
against
us
i
do
know
but
been
out
to
get
us
ever
since
his
trip
here
three
years
ago
you
know
larry
alhamid
said
slowly
i
not
quite
sure
which
is
harder
to
understand
how
a
whole
civilization
could
believe
that
sort
of
thing
or
how
a
single
intelligent
man
could
it
a
positive
feedback
the
governor
said
that
sort
of
thing
has
wrecked
civilizations
before
and
will
do
it
again
let
not
let
it
wreck
ours
are
you
ready
for
the
conference
with
our
friend
now
georges
alhamid
looked
at
the
clock
on
the
wall
ready
as
i
ever
be
you
better
scram
larry
we
must
give
tarnhorst
the
impression
that
there
some
sort
of
collusion
between
business
and
government
out
there
in
the
belt
heaven
forfend
i
get
when
he
left
the
governor
took
the
playback
with
him
the
recording
would
have
to
be
filed
in
the
special
secret
files
captain
simon
eased
his
spaceboat
down
to
the
surface
of
pallas
and
threw
on
the
magnetic
anchor
which
held
the
little
craft
solidly
to
the
metal
surface
of
the
landing
field
the
traffic
around
pallas
was
fairly
heavy
this
time
of
year
since
the
planetoid
was
on
the
same
side
of
the
sun
as
earth
and
the
big
cargo
haulers
were
moving
in
and
out
loading
refined
metals
and
raw
materials
unloading
manufactured
goods
from
earth
he
had
to
wait
several
minutes
in
the
traffic
pattern
before
being
given
clearance
for
anchoring
he
was
already
dressed
in
his
vacuum
suit
and
the
cabin
of
the
boat
was
exhausted
of
its
air
he
checked
his
control
board
making
sure
every
switch
and
dial
was
in
the
proper
position
only
then
did
he
open
the
door
and
step
out
to
the
gray
surface
of
the
landing
field
his
suitcase
a
spherical
sealed
container
that
the
belt
men
jokingly
referred
to
as
a
bomb
went
with
him
he
locked
the
door
of
his
boat
and
walked
down
the
safety
lane
toward
the
nearest
air
lock
leading
into
the
interior
of
the
planetoid
he
lifted
his
feet
and
set
them
down
with
precision
nobody
but
a
fool
wears
glide
boots
on
the
outside
he
kept
his
eyes
moving
up
and
around
on
both
sides
above
and
behind
the
yellow
path
was
supposed
to
be
a
safety
lane
but
there
was
no
need
of
taking
the
chance
of
having
an
ship
come
sliding
in
on
him
of
course
if
it
was
coming
in
really
fast
he
have
no
chance
to
move
he
might
not
even
see
it
at
all
but
why
get
slugged
by
a
slow
one
he
waited
outside
the
door
for
the
green
light
to
come
on
there
were
several
other
figures
around
him
but
he
recognize
any
of
them
he
hummed
softly
to
himself
the
green
light
came
on
and
the
door
of
the
air
lock
slid
open
the
small
crowd
trooped
inside
and
after
a
minute
the
door
slid
shut
again
as
the
elevator
dropped
simon
heard
the
familiar
as
the
air
came
rushing
in
by
the
time
it
had
reached
the
lower
level
the
elevator
was
up
to
pressure
on
earth
there
might
have
been
a
sign
in
such
an
elevator
reading
not
remove
vacuum
suits
in
there
was
no
need
for
it
here
every
man
there
knew
how
to
handle
himself
in
an
air
lock
if
he
had
he
would
have
been
there
after
he
had
stepped
out
of
the
elevator
along
with
the
others
and
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
simon
carefully
opened
the
cracking
valve
on
his
helmet
there
was
a
faint
hiss
of
incoming
air
adjusting
the
slight
pressure
differential
he
took
off
his
helmet
tucked
it
under
his
arm
and
headed
for
the
station
he
was
walking
down
the
corridor
toward
the
checker
office
when
a
hand
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
bless
me
if
it
is
simon
the
silent
long
time
no
if
you
pardon
the
clichÃ©
see
simon
turned
grinning
he
had
recognized
the
voice
hi
kerry
good
to
see
you
good
to
see
me
forsooth
od
bodkins
hast
turned
liar
on
top
of
everything
else
good
saint
good
to
see
me
indeed
such
a
face
and
form
as
mine
the
noblest
sentiments
sound
like
the
black
utterances
of
a
depraved
imagination
no
dear
old
holy
no
indeed
it
may
be
a
pleasure
to
hear
my
mellifluous
voice
a
pleasure
i
often
indulge
in
myself
but
it
could
possibly
be
a
pleasure
to
me
and
all
the
while
simon
was
being
pummeled
heartily
on
the
shoulder
while
his
hand
was
pumped
as
though
the
other
man
was
expecting
to
strike
oil
at
any
moment
his
assailant
was
not
a
handsome
man
years
before
a
rare
meteor
had
punched
its
way
through
his
helmet
and
taken
part
of
his
face
with
it
he
had
managed
to
get
back
to
his
ship
and
pump
air
in
before
he
lost
consciousness
he
had
had
to
stay
conscious
because
the
only
thing
that
held
the
air
in
his
helmet
had
been
his
hand
pressed
over
the
hole
even
so
the
drop
in
pressure
had
done
its
damage
the
surgeons
had
done
their
best
to
repair
the
smashed
face
but
kerry
brand
face
had
been
much
to
look
at
to
begin
with
and
the
mottled
purple
of
the
distended
veins
and
capillaries
did
little
to
improve
his
looks
but
his
ruined
face
was
a
badge
of
honor
and
kerry
brand
knew
the
fact
as
well
as
anyone
like
simon
captain
brand
was
a
professional
most
of
the
men
who
put
in
the
necessary
two
years
went
on
to
better
jobs
after
they
had
the
required
space
experience
but
there
were
some
who
liked
the
job
and
stuck
with
it
it
was
only
these
men
the
real
experts
among
the
fraternity
who
rated
the
title
of
captain
they
were
who
ran
things
pretty
much
their
own
way
just
going
to
the
checker
simon
asked
kerry
brand
shook
his
head
i
already
checked
in
old
sanctus
and
i
give
you
three
and
guesses
who
got
a
blue
ticket
simon
said
nothing
but
he
pointed
a
finger
at
brand
chest
a
mild
surmise
but
a
true
one
said
brand
you
are
indeed
gazing
upon
professor
kerry
brand
that
is
to
say
borer
of
asteroids
master
of
anchors
and
no
no
do
look
sorry
for
me
has
to
teach
the
tadpoles
how
to
survive
in
space
if
you
not
too
stupid
to
live
a
subject
upon
which
i
am
an
expert
on
being
too
stupid
to
live
simon
asked
gently
a
touch
a
distinct
touch
you
are
developing
a
certain
unexpected
vein
of
pawky
humor
watson
against
which
i
must
learn
to
guard
myself
he
looked
at
the
watch
on
his
wrist
why
do
you
go
ahead
and
check
in
and
then
we
go
i
have
it
on
good
authority
that
a
few
thousand
gallons
of
danish
ale
were
piped
aboard
pallas
yesterday
and
you
and
i
should
do
our
best
to
reduce
the
surplus
sounds
good
to
me
said
simon
agreeably
they
started
on
toward
the
checker
office
consider
my
dear
simon
said
brand
how
fortunate
we
are
to
be
living
in
an
age
and
a
society
where
the
dictum
who
can
do
those
who
ca
teach
no
longer
holds
true
it
means
that
we
weary
experts
are
called
in
every
so
often
handed
our
little
blue
ticket
and
given
six
months
off
pay
if
we
will
only
do
the
younger
generation
the
favor
of
pounding
a
modicum
of
knowledge
into
their
heads
during
that
time
if
we
are
very
careful
we
can
try
to
prevent
our
muscles
from
going
to
flab
and
our
brains
from
corroding
with
ennui
so
that
when
we
again
debark
into
the
infinite
sea
of
emptiness
which
surrounds
us
to
pursue
our
chosen
profession
we
get
killed
on
the
first
try
is
it
wonderful
cheer
up
said
simon
teaching
is
such
a
bad
lot
and
after
all
you
do
get
paid
for
it
and
at
a
salary
a
paid
for
his
services
i
a
salaried
minion
but
i
do
it
it
revolts
me
but
i
do
it
the
short
balding
man
behind
the
checker
desk
looked
up
as
the
two
men
approached
hello
captain
he
said
as
simon
stepped
up
to
the
desk
how
are
you
mr
murtaugh
simon
said
politely
he
handed
over
his
log
book
there
the
data
on
my
last
ten
i
be
staying
here
for
a
few
days
so
there
no
need
to
rush
the
refill
requisition
any
calls
for
me
the
checker
put
the
log
book
in
the
duplicator
i
see
if
there
are
captain
he
went
over
to
the
autofile
and
punched
simon
serial
number
very
few
people
write
to
an
anchor
man
since
he
is
free
to
check
in
and
reload
at
any
of
the
major
belt
cities
and
since
in
his
search
for
asteroids
his
erratic
orbit
is
likely
to
take
him
anywhere
it
might
be
months
or
years
before
a
written
letter
caught
up
with
him
on
the
other
hand
a
message
could
be
beamed
to
every
city
and
he
could
pick
it
up
wherever
he
was
it
cost
money
but
it
was
sure
one
call
the
checker
said
he
handed
simon
a
message
slip
it
was
unimportant
just
a
note
from
a
girl
on
vesta
he
promised
himself
that
he
make
his
next
break
at
vesta
come
what
may
he
stuck
the
flimsy
in
his
pocket
and
waited
while
the
checker
went
through
the
routine
of
recording
his
log
and
making
out
a
pay
voucher
there
was
no
small
talk
between
himself
and
the
checker
murtaugh
had
not
elected
to
take
the
schooling
necessary
to
qualify
for
other
than
a
small
desk
job
he
had
no
space
experience
unless
and
until
he
did
there
would
be
an
invisible
but
nonetheless
real
barrier
between
himself
and
any
spaceman
it
was
not
that
simon
looked
down
on
the
man
exactly
it
was
simply
that
murtaugh
had
not
proved
himself
and
therefore
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
whether
he
could
be
trusted
or
not
and
since
trust
is
a
positive
quality
lack
of
it
can
only
mean
mistrust
murtaugh
handed
captain
simon
an
envelope
that
it
captain
thank
you
simon
opened
the
envelope
took
out
his
check
and
a
blue
ticket
kerry
brand
broke
into
a
guffaw
when
the
phone
on
his
desk
rang
georges
alhamid
scooped
it
up
and
identified
himself
this
is
larry
george
said
the
governor
voice
how
are
things
so
far
so
far
so
good
alhamid
said
for
the
past
week
peter
danley
has
been
working
his
head
off
under
the
tutelage
of
two
of
the
toughest
smartest
anchor
men
in
the
business
but
you
should
have
seen
the
looks
on
their
faces
when
i
told
them
they
were
going
to
have
an
earthman
for
a
pupil
the
governor
laughed
i
bet
how
he
coming
along
he
learning
how
are
you
doing
with
your
pet
i
think
i
softening
him
george
i
found
out
what
it
was
that
got
his
goat
three
years
ago
yeah
sure
on
ceres
where
he
went
three
years
ago
he
was
treated
as
if
he
were
as
good
as
a
belt
man
alhamid
frowned
someone
was
disrespectful
no
that
is
not
exactly
but
he
was
treated
as
if
we
did
trust
his
judgment
as
though
we
were
a
little
bit
afraid
of
him
i
see
what
you
mean
sure
we
treated
him
just
as
we
would
anyone
who
has
proved
himself
and
that
meant
we
were
treating
him
the
same
way
we
treated
our
own
classes
as
he
thought
of
them
i
had
governor
holger
get
his
ceres
detectives
to
trace
down
everything
that
happened
you
can
read
the
transcript
if
you
want
there
nothing
particularly
exciting
in
it
but
you
can
see
the
pattern
if
you
know
what
to
look
for
i
not
even
certain
it
was
fully
conscious
on
his
part
i
not
sure
he
knew
why
he
disliked
us
all
he
was
convinced
of
was
that
we
were
arrogant
and
thought
we
were
better
than
he
is
it
kind
of
hard
for
us
to
see
that
a
person
would
be
that
deeply
hurt
by
seeing
the
plain
truth
that
someone
else
is
obviously
better
at
something
than
he
is
but
you
got
to
remember
that
an
earthman
is
brought
up
to
believe
that
every
person
is
just
exactly
as
good
as
every
other
and
no
better
a
man
may
have
a
skill
that
you
do
have
but
that
does
make
him
superior
oh
my
no
anyway
i
started
out
by
apologizing
for
our
habit
of
standing
up
all
the
time
i
managed
to
plant
the
idea
in
his
mind
that
the
only
thing
that
made
him
think
we
felt
superior
was
that
habit
i
even
got
him
to
the
point
where
he
standing
up
all
the
time
too
makes
him
feel
very
superior
he
learned
the
native
customs
i
get
you
alhamid
said
i
probably
contributed
to
that
inferiority
feeling
of
his
myself
did
we
all
anyway
the
next
step
was
to
take
him
around
and
introduce
him
to
some
of
the
execs
in
the
government
and
in
a
couple
of
the
companies
i
briefed
beforehand
friendly
chats
that
sort
of
thing
i
think
we
going
to
have
to
learn
the
ancient
art
of
diplomacy
out
here
if
we
going
to
survive
george
the
crowning
glory
came
this
afternoon
you
should
have
been
there
i
was
up
to
here
in
work
larry
i
just
could
take
the
time
off
to
attend
a
club
luncheon
did
the
great
man
give
his
speech
did
he
i
should
hope
to
crack
my
helmet
he
did
we
must
all
pull
together
george
did
you
know
that
we
must
care
for
the
widow
and
the
orphan
and
the
needy
george
the
needy
we
must
be
sure
to
provide
the
fools
the
idiots
the
malingerers
the
moral
degenerates
and
such
useful
lovable
beings
as
that
with
the
necessities
and
the
luxuries
of
life
we
must
see
to
it
that
they
are
respected
and
permitted
to
have
their
dignity
we
must
see
to
it
that
the
dear
little
things
are
permitted
the
rights
of
a
human
being
to
hold
his
head
up
and
spit
in
your
eye
if
he
wishes
we
must
see
to
it
that
they
be
fruitful
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
they
already
done
that
alhamid
said
caustically
and
they
can
have
it
let
just
see
that
they
do
replenish
the
belt
so
what
happened
why
george
you
never
realize
how
much
we
appreciated
that
speech
we
gave
him
a
rising
ovation
i
think
he
was
surprised
to
see
that
we
could
stand
for
three
minutes
under
a
pull
in
the
centrifuge
and
you
should
have
seen
the
smiles
on
our
faces
george
i
hope
nobody
broke
out
laughing
we
managed
to
restrain
ourselves
the
governor
said
what
next
on
the
agenda
well
it
be
tricky
but
i
think
i
can
pull
it
off
i
going
to
take
him
around
and
show
him
that
we
take
care
of
the
widow
and
the
orphan
and
hope
that
he
assumes
we
are
as
solicitous
toward
the
rest
of
his
motley
crew
wish
me
luck
good
luck
you
may
need
it
same
to
you
take
care
of
danley
do
worry
he
in
good
hands
see
you
larry
right
there
were
three
men
on
the
bleak
rocky
ground
near
the
north
pole
of
pallas
a
training
area
of
several
square
miles
known
as
the
north
forty
their
helmets
gleamed
in
the
bright
hard
light
from
a
sun
that
looked
uncomfortably
small
to
an
earthman
eyes
two
of
the
men
were
standing
facing
each
other
some
fifteen
feet
apart
the
third
attached
to
them
by
safety
lines
was
hanging
face
down
above
the
surface
rising
slowly
like
a
balloon
that
has
almost
more
weight
than
it
can
lift
no
no
danley
you
are
not
danley
you
are
climbing
do
you
understand
that
you
have
to
an
asteroid
just
as
you
would
climb
a
cliff
on
earth
you
have
to
hold
on
every
second
of
the
time
or
you
will
fall
off
simon
voice
sounded
harsh
in
danley
earphones
and
he
felt
irritatingly
helpless
poised
floatingly
above
the
ground
that
way
his
instructors
were
well
anchored
by
metal
eyes
set
into
the
rocky
surface
for
just
that
purpose
although
pallas
was
mostly
this
end
of
it
was
stony
which
was
why
it
had
been
selected
as
a
training
ground
snapped
simon
what
do
you
do
now
if
this
were
a
small
rock
you
be
drifting
a
long
ways
away
by
now
think
danley
then
shut
up
and
let
me
think
danley
snarled
if
small
things
distract
you
from
thinking
about
the
vital
necessity
of
saving
your
own
life
danley
you
would
not
live
long
in
the
belt
danley
reached
out
an
arm
to
see
if
he
could
touch
the
ground
when
he
had
pushed
himself
upwards
with
a
thrust
of
his
knee
he
had
given
himself
too
hard
a
shove
he
had
reached
the
apex
of
his
slow
flight
and
was
drifting
downward
again
he
grasped
a
jutting
rock
and
pulled
himself
back
to
the
surface
very
good
danley
but
that
would
work
on
a
small
rock
you
took
too
long
what
would
you
have
done
on
a
rock
with
a
millionth
of
a
gee
of
pull
danley
was
silent
simon
barked
would
you
do
i
i
do
know
danley
admitted
ye
gods
and
little
fishhooks
this
was
kerry
brand
voice
it
was
supposed
to
be
simon
turn
to
give
the
verbal
instructions
but
brand
allowed
himself
an
occasional
remark
when
it
was
appropriate
simon
voice
was
bitingly
sweet
what
do
you
think
those
safety
lines
are
for
danley
do
you
think
they
are
for
decorative
purposes
well
i
thought
i
was
supposed
to
think
of
some
other
way
i
mean
that
so
obvious
danley
simon
said
with
sudden
patience
we
are
not
here
to
give
you
riddles
to
solve
we
here
to
teach
you
how
to
stay
alive
in
the
belt
and
one
of
the
first
rules
you
must
learn
is
that
you
will
leave
your
boat
without
a
safety
line
an
anchor
man
danley
is
called
that
for
more
than
one
reason
you
can
not
anchor
your
boat
to
a
rock
unless
there
is
an
set
in
it
and
if
it
already
has
an
you
would
have
no
purpose
on
that
rock
in
a
way
will
be
the
anchor
of
your
boat
since
you
will
be
tied
to
it
by
your
safety
line
if
the
boat
drifts
too
far
from
your
rock
while
you
are
working
it
will
pull
you
off
the
surface
since
it
has
more
mass
than
you
do
that
should
be
allowed
to
happen
but
if
it
does
you
are
still
with
your
boat
rather
than
deserted
on
a
rock
for
the
rest
of
your
life
which
would
be
very
long
when
the
power
unit
in
your
suit
ran
out
of
energy
it
would
stop
breaking
your
exhaled
carbon
dioxide
down
into
carbon
and
oxygen
and
you
would
suffocate
even
with
emergency
tanks
of
oxygen
you
would
soon
find
yourself
freezing
to
death
that
sun
up
there
is
very
warm
mr
danley
peter
danley
was
silent
but
it
was
an
effort
to
remain
so
he
wanted
to
remind
simon
that
he
danley
had
been
a
spaceman
for
nearly
fifteen
years
but
he
was
also
aware
that
he
was
learning
things
that
taught
at
earthside
schools
most
of
his
professional
life
had
been
spent
aboard
big
comfortable
ships
that
made
the
short
hop
he
could
probably
count
the
total
hours
he
had
spent
in
a
spacesuit
on
the
fingers
of
his
two
hands
all
right
danley
let
begin
again
climb
along
the
surface
use
toeholds
handholds
and
fingerholds
feel
your
way
along
find
those
little
crevices
that
will
give
you
a
grip
it
does
take
much
a
lot
better
off
than
a
mountain
climber
on
earth
because
you
do
have
to
fight
your
weight
you
have
only
your
mass
to
worry
about
that
it
fine
very
good
mr
danley
and
later
now
danley
said
captain
brand
you
are
at
the
end
of
your
tether
so
to
speak
the
three
men
were
in
a
space
boat
several
hundred
miles
from
pallas
or
rather
two
of
them
were
in
the
boat
standing
at
the
open
door
peter
danley
was
far
out
from
it
at
the
end
of
his
safety
line
how
far
are
you
from
us
mr
danley
brand
asked
three
hundred
meters
captain
brand
danley
said
promptly
very
good
how
do
you
know
i
am
at
the
end
of
my
safety
line
which
is
three
hundred
meters
long
when
fully
extended
your
memory
is
excellent
danley
now
how
will
you
get
back
to
the
boat
pull
myself
hand
over
hand
along
the
line
think
danley
uh
oh
well
i
would
keep
pulling
i
just
give
myself
a
tug
and
then
coast
in
taking
up
the
line
slowly
as
i
went
excellent
what
would
happen
if
you
as
you
put
it
pulled
yourself
in
hand
over
hand
as
if
you
were
climbing
a
rope
on
earth
i
would
accelerate
too
much
danley
said
i
gain
too
much
momentum
and
probably
bash
my
brains
out
against
the
boat
and
i
have
no
way
to
stop
myself
bully
for
you
danley
now
see
if
you
can
put
into
action
that
which
you
have
so
succinctly
put
into
words
come
back
to
the
boat
gently
the
first
time
we
have
plenty
of
practice
so
that
you
can
get
the
feel
of
the
muscle
pull
that
will
give
you
a
maximum
of
velocity
with
a
minimum
of
impact
at
this
end
gently
now
still
later
judgment
mr
danley
simon
cautioned
you
have
to
use
judgment
a
space
boat
is
not
an
automobile
there
is
no
friction
out
here
to
slow
it
to
a
stop
your
accelerator
is
just
exactly
that
an
accelerator
taking
your
foot
off
it
wo
slow
you
down
a
bit
you
got
to
use
your
reverse
peter
danley
was
at
the
controls
of
the
boat
there
were
tiny
beads
of
perspiration
on
his
forehead
over
a
kilometer
away
was
a
hunk
of
rock
his
instructors
would
let
him
get
any
closer
they
wanted
to
be
sure
that
they
could
take
over
before
the
boat
struck
the
rock
just
in
case
danley
should
freeze
to
the
accelerator
a
little
too
long
he
was
used
to
this
sort
of
thing
he
was
used
to
a
taped
program
which
lifted
a
big
ship
aimed
it
and
went
through
the
trip
all
automatically
all
he
had
ever
had
to
do
was
drop
it
the
last
few
hundred
feet
to
a
landing
field
keep
your
eyes
moving
simon
said
your
radar
can
give
you
data
that
you
need
just
remember
that
it
ca
think
for
you
right
foot
controls
your
forward
left
foot
controls
your
reverse
ca
be
pushed
down
together
when
one
goes
down
the
other
goes
up
balance
one
against
the
your
wheel
controls
the
roll
of
the
your
wheel
toward
you
or
pushing
it
away
controls
the
the
wheel
left
or
right
controls
the
the
instructions
had
been
pounded
into
his
head
until
each
one
seemed
to
ring
like
a
separate
little
bell
the
problem
was
coordinating
his
body
to
act
on
those
instructions
one
of
the
radar
dials
told
him
how
far
he
was
from
the
rock
another
told
him
his
radial
velocity
relative
to
it
a
third
told
him
his
angular
velocity
come
to
a
dead
stop
exactly
one
thousand
meters
from
the
surface
danley
simon
ordered
danley
worked
the
controls
until
both
his
velocity
meters
read
zero
and
the
distance
meter
read
exactly
one
kilometer
very
good
danley
now
assume
that
the
surface
of
your
rock
is
at
nine
hundred
meters
bring
your
boat
to
a
dead
stop
exactly
fifty
centimeters
from
that
surface
danley
worked
the
controls
again
he
grinned
with
satisfaction
when
the
distance
meter
showed
nine
nine
five
point
five
on
the
nose
captain
simon
sighed
deeply
danley
do
you
feel
a
little
shaken
up
banged
around
a
little
do
you
feel
as
though
you
just
gotten
a
shock
uh
no
you
should
you
slammed
this
boat
a
good
two
feet
into
the
surface
of
that
rock
before
you
backed
out
again
his
voice
changed
tone
dammit
danley
when
i
say
at
nine
nine
five
i
mean
edway
tarnhorst
had
been
dictating
notes
for
his
reports
into
his
recorder
and
was
rather
tired
so
when
he
asked
peter
danley
what
he
had
learned
he
was
rather
irritated
when
the
blond
man
closed
his
blue
eyes
and
repeated
parrotlike
due
to
the
lack
of
a
atmosphere
many
minerals
are
found
in
the
asteroids
which
are
unknown
on
earth
among
the
more
important
of
these
are
oldhamite
cas
daubrÃ©elite
schreibersite
and
rhabdite
p
lawrencite
and
taenite
an
alloy
of
iron
containing
that
not
precisely
the
sort
of
thing
i
meant
tarnhorst
interrupted
testily
danley
smiled
i
know
i
sorry
that
my
lesson
for
tomorrow
so
i
gathered
may
i
sit
down
there
were
only
two
chairs
in
the
room
danley
was
occupying
one
and
a
pile
of
books
was
occupying
the
other
danley
quickly
got
to
his
feet
and
began
putting
the
books
on
his
desk
certainly
tarnhorst
sit
down
tarnhorst
lowered
himself
into
the
newly
emptied
chair
i
apologize
for
interrupting
your
studies
he
said
i
realize
how
important
they
are
but
there
are
a
few
points
i
like
to
discuss
with
you
certainly
danley
seated
himself
and
looked
at
the
older
man
expectantly
the
nullifiers
are
on
he
said
of
course
tarnhorst
said
absently
then
changing
his
manner
he
said
abruptly
have
you
found
anything
yet
danley
shook
his
head
no
it
looks
to
me
as
though
they
done
everything
possible
to
make
sure
that
these
men
get
the
best
equipment
and
the
best
training
the
training
instructors
have
been
through
the
whole
affair
themselves
they
know
the
ropes
the
equipment
as
far
as
i
can
tell
is
top
grade
stuff
from
what
i
have
seen
so
far
the
company
is
stinting
on
the
equipment
or
the
training
tarnhorst
nodded
after
nearly
three
months
of
investigation
i
have
come
to
the
same
conclusion
myself
the
records
show
that
expenditures
on
equipment
has
been
steadily
increasing
the
equipment
they
have
now
i
understand
is
almost
he
looked
questioningly
at
danley
danley
nodded
apparently
certainly
no
one
is
killed
because
of
equipment
failure
it
the
finest
stuff
i
ever
seen
and
yet
tarnhorst
said
their
books
show
that
they
are
constantly
seeking
to
improve
it
i
do
suppose
there
is
any
chance
of
juggling
the
books
on
you
is
there
tarnhorst
smiled
a
superior
smile
hardly
in
the
first
place
i
know
bookkeeping
in
the
second
it
would
be
impossible
to
whip
up
a
complete
set
of
balancing
books
covering
a
period
of
nearly
eighty
years
overnight
i
agree
danley
said
i
do
think
they
set
up
a
special
training
course
just
for
me
overnight
either
i
seen
classes
on
vesta
juno
and
eros
and
they
all
the
same
there
are
any
fancy
false
fronts
to
fool
us
tarnhorst
i
looked
very
closely
have
you
talked
to
the
men
yes
they
have
no
complaints
again
tarnhorst
nodded
i
have
found
the
same
thing
they
all
insist
that
if
a
man
gets
killed
in
space
it
not
the
fault
of
anyone
but
himself
or
as
it
may
be
an
act
of
god
one
of
my
instructors
ran
into
an
act
of
god
some
years
ago
danley
said
you
met
him
brand
the
one
with
the
scarred
face
he
explained
to
tarnhorst
what
had
caused
brand
disfigurement
but
he
survived
he
finished
because
he
kept
his
wits
about
him
even
after
he
was
hit
commendable
very
commendable
tarnhorst
said
if
he
been
an
excitable
fool
he
have
died
true
but
what
i
was
trying
to
point
out
was
that
it
was
equipment
failure
that
caused
the
accident
no
you
quite
right
tarnhorst
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
looked
into
danley
eyes
do
you
think
you
could
take
on
a
job
as
anchor
man
now
i
do
know
said
danley
evenly
but
i
going
to
find
out
tomorrow
peter
danley
took
his
final
examination
the
following
day
all
by
himself
he
went
through
the
procedure
of
positioning
his
ship
setting
up
a
rocket
drill
firing
it
and
setting
in
an
anchor
it
was
only
a
small
rock
nine
meters
through
but
the
job
was
almost
the
same
as
with
the
big
ones
not
far
away
captain
simon
watched
the
procedure
through
a
pair
of
field
glasses
he
breathed
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
when
the
job
was
done
jules
he
said
softly
i
am
sure
glad
that
man
did
hurt
himself
any
yes
we
of
sho
been
in
trouble
if
he
of
killed
hisself
we
will
have
to
tell
captain
brand
that
our
pupil
has
done
pretty
well
for
such
a
small
amount
of
schooling
i
think
that
would
be
proper
and
we
will
also
have
to
tell
captain
brand
that
this
boy
would
last
a
month
he
would
come
back
from
his
first
trip
there
was
no
answer
to
that
three
days
later
amid
a
cloud
of
generally
satisfied
feelings
edway
tarnhorst
and
peter
danley
took
the
ship
back
to
earth
i
can
not
of
course
give
you
a
copy
of
my
report
tarnhorst
had
told
georges
alhamid
that
is
for
the
eyes
of
the
committee
only
however
i
may
say
that
i
do
not
find
the
belt
companies
or
the
governments
of
the
belt
cities
at
fault
do
you
want
to
know
my
personal
opinion
i
would
appreciate
it
tarnhorst
georges
had
said
carelessness
just
plain
carelessness
on
the
part
of
the
workers
that
is
what
has
caused
your
rise
in
death
rates
you
people
out
here
in
the
belt
have
become
too
used
to
being
in
space
familiarity
breeds
contempt
alhamid
steps
must
be
taken
to
curb
that
carelessness
i
suggest
a
publicity
campaign
of
some
kind
the
people
must
be
thoroughly
indoctrinated
in
safety
procedures
and
warned
against
carelessness
just
a
few
months
of
schooling
is
enough
alhamid
you
got
to
start
pounding
it
into
their
heads
early
if
you
do
he
shook
his
head
he
had
grown
used
to
doing
so
in
low
gravity
by
now
if
the
death
rate
is
cut
down
we
shall
have
to
raise
the
premium
rates
and
i
do
know
what
will
happen
on
the
floor
of
the
people
congress
however
i
think
i
can
guarantee
six
months
to
a
year
before
any
steps
are
taken
that
will
give
you
time
to
launch
your
safety
campaign
i
certain
that
as
soon
as
this
carelessness
is
curbed
the
claims
will
drop
down
to
their
former
low
point
we
certainly
try
that
alhamid
had
said
heartily
thank
you
very
much
mr
tarnhorst
when
they
had
finally
gone
alhamid
spoke
to
the
governor
that
that
larry
you
can
bring
it
up
at
the
next
meeting
of
the
board
of
governors
get
some
kind
of
publicity
campaign
going
plug
safety
tell
carelessness
is
bad
it
ca
hurt
anything
and
actually
might
help
who
knows
what
are
you
going
to
do
at
your
end
what
we
should
have
done
long
ago
finance
the
insurance
ourselves
for
the
next
couple
of
years
we
only
make
death
claims
to
earth
for
a
part
of
the
total
we
pay
off
the
rest
ourselves
then
we
tell
we
brought
the
cost
down
so
much
that
we
can
afford
to
do
our
own
insurance
financing
we
let
this
insurance
thing
ride
too
long
and
it
has
damn
near
got
us
in
a
jam
we
needed
the
income
from
earth
we
still
could
use
it
but
we
need
our
independence
more
i
second
the
motion
the
governor
said
fervently
look
suppose
you
come
over
to
my
place
tonight
and
we
work
out
the
details
of
this
report
say
at
nine
fine
larry
i
see
you
then
alhamid
went
back
to
his
office
he
was
met
at
the
door
by
his
secretary
who
handed
him
a
sealed
envelope
the
earthman
left
this
here
for
you
he
said
you
know
what
to
do
with
it
alhamid
took
the
envelope
and
looked
at
the
name
on
the
outside
which
earthman
he
asked
the
young
one
she
said
the
blond
one
it
is
even
addressed
to
me
alhamid
said
with
a
note
of
puzzled
speculation
in
his
voice
no
i
noticed
that
i
told
him
he
could
send
it
straight
to
the
school
but
he
said
you
would
know
how
to
handle
it
alhamid
looked
at
the
envelope
again
and
his
eyes
narrowed
a
little
call
captain
simon
will
you
tell
him
i
would
like
to
have
him
come
to
my
office
do
mention
this
letter
i
do
want
it
breezed
all
over
pallas
it
was
nearly
twenty
minutes
before
simon
showed
up
alhamid
handed
him
the
envelope
you
have
a
message
from
your
star
pupil
for
some
reason
he
wanted
me
to
deliver
it
to
you
i
have
a
hunch
you
know
what
that
reason
is
after
you
read
it
he
grinned
i
appreciate
it
if
you
tell
me
when
you
find
out
this
danley
has
worried
me
all
along
simon
scowled
at
the
envelope
then
ripped
off
one
end
and
took
out
the
typed
sheets
he
read
them
carefully
then
handed
them
over
to
alhamid
you
better
read
this
yourself
george
georges
alhamid
took
the
pages
and
began
to
read
dear
captain
simon
i
am
addressing
this
to
you
rather
than
anyone
else
because
i
think
you
will
understand
more
than
anyone
else
captain
brand
is
a
fine
person
but
i
have
never
felt
very
much
at
ease
with
him
i
go
into
the
psychological
reasons
that
may
exist
other
than
admit
that
my
reasons
are
purely
emotional
i
do
honestly
know
how
much
they
are
based
on
his
disfigurement
alhamid
is
almost
a
stranger
to
me
you
are
the
only
belt
man
i
feel
i
know
well
first
i
want
to
say
that
i
honestly
enjoyed
our
three
months
together
there
were
times
when
i
could
have
cheerfully
bashed
your
head
in
i
admit
but
the
experience
has
left
me
feeling
more
like
a
real
human
being
more
like
a
person
in
my
own
right
than
i
have
ever
felt
before
in
my
life
believe
me
i
appreciate
it
deeply
i
know
now
that
i
can
do
things
on
my
own
without
being
dependent
on
the
support
of
a
team
or
a
committee
and
for
that
i
am
grateful
tarnhorst
has
heard
my
report
and
accepted
it
his
report
to
the
people
congress
will
lay
the
entire
blame
for
the
death
rate
rise
on
individual
carelessness
rather
than
on
any
fault
of
management
i
think
in
the
main
i
am
justified
in
making
such
a
report
to
tarnhorst
although
i
am
fully
aware
that
it
is
incomplete
i
know
that
if
i
had
told
him
the
whole
truth
there
would
be
a
ruckus
kicked
up
on
earth
that
would
cause
more
trouble
in
the
belt
than
i
care
to
think
about
i
sure
you
as
aware
of
the
political
situation
as
i
am
you
see
i
know
that
could
be
made
a
great
deal
safer
i
know
that
machines
could
be
developed
which
would
make
the
job
so
nearly
automatic
that
the
operator
would
never
be
exposed
to
any
more
danger
than
he
would
be
in
a
ship
on
the
run
perhaps
that
a
little
exaggerated
but
not
much
what
puzzled
me
was
why
should
the
companies
build
these
machines
if
they
were
more
efficient
why
should
every
belt
man
defend
the
system
as
it
was
why
should
men
risk
their
necks
when
they
could
demand
better
equipment
i
do
mean
that
the
equipment
presently
used
is
poor
i
just
mean
that
full
mechanization
would
do
away
with
the
present
type
of
equipment
and
replace
it
with
a
different
type
going
through
your
course
of
instruction
gave
me
the
answer
to
that
even
though
i
did
take
the
full
treatment
all
my
life
i
belonged
to
an
organization
of
some
kind
the
team
the
crew
whatever
it
might
be
but
the
team
was
everything
and
i
was
recognized
only
as
a
member
of
the
team
i
was
a
replaceable
unit
not
an
individual
in
my
own
right
i
do
know
that
i
can
explain
the
difference
exactly
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
team
is
something
outside
of
which
the
individual
has
no
existence
while
the
men
of
the
belt
can
form
a
team
because
they
know
that
each
member
is
in
his
own
right
on
earth
we
all
depend
on
the
team
and
in
the
long
run
that
means
that
we
are
depending
on
each
other
but
none
of
us
feels
he
can
depend
on
himself
every
man
hopes
that
as
a
member
of
the
team
he
will
be
saved
from
his
own
errors
his
own
failures
but
he
knows
that
everyone
else
is
doing
the
same
thing
and
deep
down
inside
he
knows
that
they
are
not
deserving
of
his
reliance
so
he
puts
his
reliance
in
the
team
as
if
that
were
some
sort
of
separate
entity
in
itself
and
had
magical
infallible
powers
that
were
greater
than
the
aggregate
of
the
individuals
that
composed
it
in
a
way
this
is
certainly
so
since
teamwork
can
accomplish
things
that
mobs
can
not
do
but
the
team
is
a
failure
if
each
member
assumes
that
he
himself
is
helpless
and
can
do
nothing
but
that
the
team
will
do
it
for
him
men
who
have
gone
through
the
belt
training
program
men
who
have
space
experience
as
you
so
euphemistically
put
it
are
men
who
can
form
a
real
team
one
that
will
get
things
done
because
each
man
knows
he
can
rely
on
the
others
not
only
as
a
team
but
as
individuals
but
to
mechanize
the
phase
would
destroy
all
that
completely
i
do
want
to
see
that
destroyed
because
i
have
felt
what
it
is
to
be
a
part
of
the
belt
team
even
though
only
a
small
and
unreliable
part
actually
i
know
i
was
not
and
could
never
be
a
real
member
of
that
team
but
i
was
and
am
proud
to
have
scrimmaged
with
the
team
and
i
glad
to
be
able
to
sit
on
the
and
cheer
even
if
i
ca
carry
the
ball
it
just
occurred
to
me
that
those
metaphors
might
be
a
little
cloudy
to
you
since
you
have
football
in
the
belt
but
i
think
you
see
what
i
mean
i
imagine
that
most
of
the
men
who
have
no
space
experience
feel
the
same
way
they
know
they
never
make
a
go
of
it
out
in
space
but
they
happy
to
be
water
boys
i
wish
i
could
stay
in
the
belt
i
enough
of
a
spaceman
to
appreciate
what
it
really
is
to
be
a
member
of
a
space
society
but
i
also
know
that
i
never
last
i
not
fitted
for
it
really
i
had
a
small
taste
of
it
but
i
know
i
could
take
a
full
dose
i
worked
hard
for
the
influence
and
security
i
have
in
my
job
and
i
could
give
it
up
maybe
this
brands
me
as
a
coward
in
your
eyes
and
maybe
i
am
a
coward
but
that
the
way
i
built
i
hope
you
take
that
into
account
when
you
think
of
me
at
any
rate
i
have
done
what
i
have
done
on
earth
there
are
men
who
envy
you
and
hate
you
and
there
will
be
others
who
will
try
to
destroy
you
but
i
have
done
what
i
could
to
give
you
a
chance
to
gain
the
strength
you
need
to
resist
the
encroachment
of
sickness
i
have
a
feeling
that
tarnhorst
saw
your
greatness
too
although
he
never
admit
it
even
to
himself
certainly
something
changed
him
during
the
last
months
even
though
he
does
realize
it
he
came
out
wanting
to
help
and
by
that
he
meant
help
the
common
people
against
the
tyranny
of
the
companies
he
still
wants
to
help
the
common
people
but
now
he
wants
to
do
it
the
companies
the
change
is
so
subtle
that
he
does
think
changed
at
all
but
i
can
see
it
i
do
deserve
any
thanks
for
what
i
have
done
all
i
have
done
is
repay
you
in
the
only
way
i
knew
how
for
what
you
have
done
for
me
i
may
never
see
you
again
captain
but
i
will
always
remember
you
please
convey
my
warmest
regards
to
captain
brand
and
to
alhamid
sincerely
peter
danley
georges
alhamid
handed
the
letter
back
to
simon
there
your
star
pupil
he
said
gently
simon
nodded
the
wise
fool
the
guy
who
got
sense
enough
to
know
that
he
is
competent
to
do
the
job
did
you
notice
that
he
waltzed
all
around
the
real
reason
for
the
program
without
quite
hitting
it
simon
smiled
humorlessly
sure
notice
the
wording
of
the
letter
he
still
thinks
in
terms
of
the
team
even
when
he
trying
not
to
he
thinks
we
do
this
just
to
train
men
to
have
a
real
good
team
spirit
he
ca
see
that
that
is
only
a
very
useful
how
could
he
think
otherwise
alhamid
asked
to
him
or
to
tarnhorst
the
notion
of
deliberately
tailoring
a
program
so
that
it
would
kill
off
the
fools
and
the
incompetents
setting
up
a
program
that
will
deliberately
destroy
the
men
who
are
dangerous
to
society
would
be
horrifying
they
would
accuse
us
of
being
soulless
butchers
who
had
no
respect
for
the
dignity
of
the
human
soul
we
not
butchering
anybody
simon
objected
nobody
is
forced
to
go
through
two
years
of
anchor
setting
nobody
is
forced
to
die
not
running
people
into
gas
chambers
or
anything
like
that
no
of
course
not
but
would
you
expect
an
earthman
like
tarnhorst
to
see
the
difference
how
could
we
explain
to
him
that
we
have
no
objection
to
fools
other
than
that
we
object
to
putting
them
in
positions
where
they
can
harm
others
by
their
foolishness
would
you
expect
him
to
understand
that
we
must
have
a
method
of
eliminating
those
who
are
neither
competent
enough
to
be
trusted
with
the
lives
of
others
nor
wise
enough
to
see
that
they
are
not
competent
how
would
you
tell
him
that
the
reason
we
send
men
out
alone
is
so
that
if
he
destroys
anyone
by
his
foolishness
after
we
have
taught
him
everything
we
know
in
the
best
way
we
know
how
he
will
only
destroy
himself
i
would
even
try
simon
said
there
an
old
saying
that
neither
money
education
liquor
nor
women
ever
made
a
fool
of
a
man
they
just
give
a
born
fool
a
chance
to
display
his
foolishness
space
ought
to
be
added
to
that
list
did
you
notice
something
else
about
that
letter
alhamid
asked
i
mean
the
very
fact
that
he
wrote
a
letter
instead
of
telling
you
personally
sure
he
did
trust
me
he
was
afraid
i
or
someone
else
would
dispose
of
him
if
we
knew
he
knew
our
secret
i
think
that
it
alhamid
agreed
he
wanted
to
be
safely
away
first
killing
him
would
have
brought
down
the
biggest
investigation
the
earth
congress
has
launched
since
the
of
the
ship
thirty
years
ago
does
he
think
we
are
fools
you
ca
blame
him
he
been
brought
up
that
way
and
three
months
of
training
is
going
to
change
him
simon
frowned
suppose
he
changes
his
mind
suppose
he
tells
tarnhorst
what
he
thinks
he
wo
he
told
his
lie
and
now
he
have
to
stick
by
it
or
lose
his
precious
security
if
he
could
trade
that
for
freedom
he
sure
is
going
to
throw
it
away
alhamid
grinned
but
can
you
imagine
a
guy
thinking
that
anchor
setting
could
be
completely
mechanized
simon
grinned
back
i
guess
i
not
a
very
good
teacher
after
all
i
told
him
and
told
him
and
told
him
for
three
solid
months
that
the
job
required
judgment
but
it
evidently
did
sink
in
he
got
the
heart
of
a
romantic
and
the
soul
of
an
earthman
a
very
bad
combination
he
has
my
sympathy
alhamid
said
with
feeling
now
about
you
your
blue
ticket
still
has
three
months
to
run
but
i
ca
give
you
a
class
if
you
only
going
to
run
through
the
first
half
of
the
course
with
them
and
i
do
have
any
more
earthmen
for
you
to
give
special
tutoring
to
you
have
three
choices
you
can
loaf
with
pay
for
three
months
you
can
go
back
to
space
and
get
double
pay
for
three
months
or
you
can
take
a
regular
class
and
get
double
pay
for
the
last
three
months
which
it
be
simon
grinned
widely
i
going
to
loaf
until
i
get
sick
of
it
then
i
go
back
to
space
and
collect
double
pay
for
what
left
of
the
three
months
first
off
i
going
to
take
a
run
over
to
vesta
after
that
who
knows
i
thought
so
most
of
you
guys
would
stay
out
there
forever
if
you
did
have
to
come
back
for
supplies
simon
shook
his
head
nope
not
true
a
man
got
to
come
back
every
so
often
and
get
his
feet
on
the
ground
if
you
stay
out
there
too
long
you
get
to
talking
to
yourself
an
hour
later
the
spaceboat
lifted
from
the
surface
of
pallas
and
shot
toward
vesta
jules
old
cobblestone
we
have
just

then
all
alone

simon
burst
into
song
oh

the

and
the
captain
too
and
the
men
of

the

tight
and
