the
perils
of
pauline
by
charles
goddard
chapter
i
the
breath
of
dead
centuries
in
one
of
the
stateliest
mansions
on
the
lower
hudson
near
new
york
old
stanford
marvin
president
of
the
marvin
motors
company
dozed
over
his
papers
while
owen
his
confidential
secretary
eyed
him
across
the
mahogany
desk
a
soft
purring
sound
floated
in
the
open
window
and
the
aged
manufacturer
it
came
from
one
of
his
own
cars
six
cylinders
chanting
in
unison
a
litany
of
power
to
the
great
modern
god
of
gasoline
these
things
had
been
in
his
mind
since
the
motor
industry
started
he
had
lived
with
them
wrestled
with
them
during
his
meals
and
taken
them
to
his
dreams
at
night
now
they
formed
a
rhythm
and
he
heard
them
in
his
brain
just
before
the
fainting
spells
which
had
come
so
frequently
of
late
he
glanced
at
the
secretary
and
noted
owen
gaze
with
something
of
a
start
what
are
you
thinking
about
raymond
he
queried
with
his
customary
directness
your
health
sir
replied
owen
who
like
all
intelligent
rascals
never
lied
when
the
truth
would
do
equally
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
owen
had
wondered
whether
his
employer
would
last
a
year
or
a
month
he
much
preferred
a
month
for
there
was
reason
to
believe
that
the
marvin
will
would
contain
a
handsome
bequest
to
my
faithful
secretary
oh
bosh
said
the
old
man
you
and
stevens
would
make
a
mummy
of
me
before
i
dead
that
reminds
me
sir
said
owen
smoothly
that
the
international
express
company
has
delivered
a
large
crate
addressed
to
you
from
cairo
egypt
i
presume
it
is
the
mummy
you
bought
on
your
last
trip
where
shall
i
place
it
marvin
eye
coursed
around
the
walls
of
the
handsome
library
which
had
been
his
office
since
the
doctor
had
forbidden
him
to
visit
his
automobile
works
and
mills
take
out
that
bust
of
pallas
athene
he
ordered
and
stand
the
mummy
up
in
its
place
owen
nodded
poised
his
pencil
and
prompted
you
were
just
dictating
about
the
new
piston
rings
marvin
drew
his
hand
across
his
eyes
and
looked
out
the
window
within
the
range
of
his
vision
was
one
of
the
most
charming
sights
in
the
world
a
handsome
youth
and
a
pretty
girl
arrayed
in
white
flannels
playing
tennis
never
mind
the
letters
tell
harry
and
pauline
i
wish
to
see
them
alone
the
old
man
opened
a
drawer
and
took
a
dose
of
medicine
then
he
unfolded
stevens
letter
and
read
its
final
paragraph
which
prescribed
a
change
of
climate
together
with
complete
and
permanent
rest
or
i
will
not
answer
for
the
consequences
there
was
little
doubt
that
no
primer
mover
in
a
great
industry
was
better
able
to
leave
its
helm
than
standford
marvin
his
lieutenants
were
able
efficient
and
contented
the
factories
would
go
of
their
own
momentum
for
a
year
or
two
at
least
then
his
son
harry
just
out
of
college
should
be
able
perhaps
to
help
his
lieutenants
had
proved
marvin
unerring
instinct
in
judging
character
not
one
single
case
came
to
the
old
employer
mind
of
a
man
who
had
failed
to
turn
out
exactly
as
he
expected
yet
the
most
trusted
man
of
all
raymond
owen
the
secretary
was
disloyal
and
dishonest
this
one
exception
was
easily
enough
explained
when
owen
came
to
marvin
attention
fifteen
years
before
he
was
a
fine
honest
faithful
man
it
was
born
and
bred
in
him
to
be
straight
during
the
first
five
or
six
years
in
the
marvin
household
the
older
man
took
pains
to
keep
watch
on
this
quiet
tactful
youth
until
he
knew
all
his
ways
and
even
his
habits
of
thought
there
was
no
doubt
that
owen
was
as
upright
and
clean
as
the
old
man
himself
at
the
age
of
forty
the
devil
entered
into
owen
it
came
in
the
form
of
insomnia
loss
of
sleep
will
make
any
man
irritable
and
unreasonable
but
hardly
dishonest
with
the
sleeplessness
however
came
the
temptation
to
take
drugs
owen
shifted
from
one
narcotic
to
another
finally
settling
down
upon
morphine
five
years
of
the
opiate
had
made
him
its
slave
every
physician
knows
that
morphine
fiends
become
dishonest
the
secretary
had
speculated
with
his
modest
savings
and
lost
them
he
had
borrowed
and
lost
again
and
now
for
some
time
had
been
betting
on
horse
races
this
last
had
made
him
acquainted
with
a
certain
montgomery
hicks
who
lived
well
without
visible
source
of
income
through
hicks
owen
had
betrayed
one
of
his
employer
guarded
secrets
hicks
armed
with
this
secret
promptly
changed
from
a
friendly
creditor
to
a
blackmailer
owen
on
his
way
to
summon
pauline
and
harry
descended
to
the
basement
where
the
butler
gardener
and
a
colored
man
were
uncrating
the
egyptian
mummy
he
told
them
to
stand
it
in
place
of
the
bust
of
pallas
athene
in
the
library
and
then
went
out
crossing
the
splendid
lawns
and
graveled
roads
to
the
tennis
court
there
was
no
design
in
owen
mind
against
the
two
players
but
of
late
the
instinct
of
both
the
hunter
and
the
hunted
were
showing
in
him
and
it
prompted
him
to
approach
quietly
and
under
cover
so
he
passed
along
the
edge
of
a
hedge
and
stood
a
moment
within
earshot
pauline
was
about
to
serve
but
paused
to
look
down
at
the
loosened
laces
of
her
small
white
shoe
she
heard
harry
racquet
drop
and
saw
him
hurdle
the
net
in
another
instant
he
was
at
her
feet
tying
the
tiny
bow
you
need
have
done
that
harry
she
said
oh
no
harry
affirmed
as
he
vainly
tried
to
make
his
bow
as
trim
as
its
mate
i
suppose
not
i
do
suppose
i
need
to
think
about
you
all
the
time
either
or
follow
you
around
till
that
new
cocker
spaniel
of
yours
thinks
i
part
of
your
shadow
perhaps
i
do
need
to
love
you
harry
get
up
someone
will
see
you
and
think
you
proposing
to
me
think
they
ought
to
know
i
proposing
but
pauline
talking
about
there
is
any
need
of
your
being
so
pretty
your
eyes
are
bigger
and
bluer
than
they
really
need
to
be
you
could
see
just
as
well
if
you
did
have
such
long
curly
lashes
and
there
is
any
real
necessity
for
the
way
they
group
together
in
that
starry
effect
like
nell
brinkley
girls
is
there
any
need
of
fifteen
different
beautiful
shades
of
light
where
the
sun
strikes
your
hair
just
back
of
your
ear
harry
stop
this
the
score
is
yes
all
these
things
are
entirely
unnecessary
i
going
to
have
old
mother
nature
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
for
willful
wasteful
wanton
extravagance
unless
unless
harry
paused
now
harry
do
use
up
your
whole
vocabulary
promise
what
promise
to
marry
me
at
once
no
harry
i
ca
do
that
that
is
right
away
i
must
have
time
why
time
pauline
do
you
love
me
yes
i
think
i
do
love
you
harry
and
you
know
there
is
nobody
else
in
the
world
then
what
do
you
want
time
for
why
to
see
life
and
to
know
what
life
really
is
all
right
marry
me
and
i
show
you
life
i
lead
you
any
kind
of
a
life
you
want
no
that
wo
do
as
an
old
married
woman
i
really
do
what
i
want
i
must
see
life
in
its
great
moments
i
must
have
thrills
adventures
see
people
do
daring
things
watch
battles
it
might
be
best
for
me
even
to
see
someone
killed
if
that
were
possible
as
i
was
telling
harley
john
last
night
harley
john
well
if
i
catch
that
fop
taking
you
motoring
again
you
get
your
wish
and
see
a
real
nice
aristocratic
murder
he
ought
to
be
put
out
of
his
misery
anyway
but
where
did
you
get
all
these
sudden
notions
about
wild
and
strenuous
life
pauline
did
not
answer
they
both
heard
a
discreet
cough
and
owen
rounded
the
corner
of
the
hedge
he
delivered
his
message
and
the
three
walked
slowly
toward
the
house
advancing
to
meet
them
came
a
dashy
checked
suit
above
it
was
a
large
panama
hat
with
a
gaudy
ribbon
a
red
necktie
was
also
visible
even
at
a
considerable
distance
between
the
hat
and
the
necktie
a
face
several
degrees
darker
in
color
than
the
tie
came
into
view
as
the
distance
lessened
it
was
montgomery
hicks
whose
first
name
was
usually
pronounced
mugumry
and
thence
degenerated
into
mug
inflamed
and
scowling
face
and
bulging
eyes
usually
conveyed
the
general
impression
that
he
was
about
to
burst
into
profanity
a
conjecture
which
frequently
proved
correct
in
this
case
he
merely
remarked
in
a
sort
of
newsboy
voice
raymond
owen
i
believe
the
secretary
sallow
face
flushed
a
little
as
he
stepped
aside
and
let
harry
and
pauline
pass
out
of
earshot
see
here
mug
complained
owen
i
have
a
cent
for
you
you
will
get
me
discharged
if
you
come
around
here
like
this
well
i
get
you
fired
right
now
growled
mug
if
you
do
come
across
with
the
money
and
he
started
toward
the
front
steps
owen
led
him
out
of
sight
of
the
house
and
finally
got
rid
of
him
for
a
blackmailer
knows
he
can
strike
but
once
and
having
struck
he
loses
all
power
over
his
victim
so
hicks
withheld
the
blow
collected
a
paltry
thirty
dollars
and
consented
to
wait
a
little
while
for
marvin
to
die
harry
and
pauline
passed
on
into
the
house
he
had
the
straight
backbone
and
well
poised
head
of
the
west
pointer
but
without
the
unnatural
stiffness
of
the
soldier
carriage
the
shoulders
of
the
halfback
and
the
lean
hips
of
a
runner
were
his
and
he
had
earned
them
in
four
years
on
his
varsity
football
and
track
teams
the
girl
beside
him
half
a
head
shorter
tripped
along
with
the
easy
action
of
a
thoroughbred
both
bore
the
name
of
marvin
yet
there
was
no
relationship
harry
mother
long
dead
had
adopted
this
girl
on
marvin
first
trip
to
egypt
pauline
was
the
daughter
of
an
english
father
and
a
native
mother
marvin
first
saw
her
as
a
baby
too
young
to
understand
that
its
parents
had
just
been
drowned
in
the
nile
as
brother
and
sister
they
grew
up
together
until
college
separated
the
two
after
four
years
pauline
dainty
prettiness
struck
harry
with
a
distinct
shock
the
delightful
sort
of
shock
known
as
love
at
first
sight
it
was
really
harry
first
sight
of
her
as
a
woman
every
sense
and
instinct
in
him
shouted
get
that
girl
and
nothing
in
him
answered
no
marvin
looked
unusually
pale
as
those
two
very
vital
young
persons
stepped
into
the
library
he
read
their
thoughts
and
said
quietly
harry
i
been
placed
in
the
hands
of
a
receiver
receiver
echoed
harry
with
amazement
for
he
knew
that
marvin
enterprises
were
financed
magnificently
yes
stevens
is
the
receiver
he
says
i
have
exhausted
my
entire
stock
of
nervous
capital
that
my
account
at
the
bank
of
physical
endurance
is
overdrawn
nature
has
called
her
loans
and
you
might
say
that
i
am
a
nervous
bankrupt
so
all
you
need
is
rest
cried
pauline
and
you
will
be
as
strong
as
ever
well
before
i
rest
i
want
to
assure
myself
about
you
children
harry
you
love
pauline
do
you
you
bet
i
do
father
pauline
you
love
harry
do
you
yes
answered
pauline
slowly
and
you
will
marry
right
away
this
very
minute
if
she
would
have
me
said
harry
and
you
pauline
queried
the
old
man
yes
father
for
she
loved
him
and
felt
toward
him
as
if
she
were
indeed
his
daughter
perhaps
some
time
i
marry
harry
but
not
for
a
year
or
two
i
could
marry
him
now
it
would
be
right
would
be
right
well
i
like
to
know
why
not
pauline
was
silent
a
moment
she
hated
to
oppose
this
fine
old
man
but
her
will
was
as
firm
as
his
and
well
he
knew
it
harry
spoke
for
her
oh
she
wants
to
see
life
before
she
settles
down
wild
life
sin
and
iniquity
battle
murder
and
sudden
death
and
all
that
sort
of
stuff
i
do
know
what
has
gotten
into
women
these
days
anyway
then
polly
prettily
daintily
as
she
did
all
things
and
with
charming
little
blushes
and
hesitations
confessed
her
secret
in
short
it
was
her
ambition
to
be
a
writer
a
writer
of
something
worth
while
a
great
writer
to
be
a
great
writer
one
must
know
life
and
to
know
life
one
must
see
it
see
the
world
she
ended
by
asking
the
two
men
if
this
were
not
so
they
looked
at
each
other
and
coughed
with
evident
relief
it
the
comparative
harmlessness
of
her
whim
yes
polly
said
old
man
marvin
a
great
writer
ought
to
see
life
in
order
to
know
what
he
is
writing
about
but
what
makes
you
suspect
that
you
have
the
ability
to
be
even
an
ordinary
writer
marvin
sire
winked
at
marvin
son
and
marvin
son
winked
back
for
no
man
is
too
old
or
too
young
to
enjoy
teasing
a
pretty
and
serious
girl
pauline
saw
the
wink
and
her
foot
ceased
tracing
a
pattern
in
the
carpet
and
stamped
on
it
instead
i
show
you
what
reason
i
have
to
think
i
can
write
my
first
story
has
just
been
published
in
the
biggest
magazine
in
the
country
i
have
had
a
copy
of
it
lying
around
here
for
days
with
my
story
in
it
and
nobody
has
even
looked
at
it
out
she
flashed
and
harry
after
her
almost
upsetting
the
butler
and
gardener
who
appeared
in
the
library
doorway
these
two
worthies
advanced
upon
the
statue
of
pallas
without
noticing
the
master
of
the
house
sitting
behind
his
big
desk
the
butler
did
notice
that
a
large
hound
from
the
stable
had
followed
the
gardener
into
the
room
that
what
one
gets
for
letting
outdoor
servants
into
the
house
muttered
the
butler
as
he
hustled
the
big
dog
to
the
front
door
and
ejected
him
is
he
addressing
himself
to
me
or
to
the
pup
i
wonder
asked
the
gardener
a
fat
irishman
as
he
placed
himself
in
front
of
the
statue
he
read
the
name
pallas
forced
his
rusty
derby
hat
down
over
his
ears
in
imitation
of
the
statue
helmet
and
mimicked
the
pose
together
they
staggered
out
with
their
burden
a
moment
later
they
returned
carrying
with
the
help
of
two
other
men
the
mummy
in
its
big
case
owen
also
entered
and
marvin
with
the
joy
of
an
egyptologist
grasped
a
magnifying
glass
and
examined
the
case
the
old
man
bobby
had
been
egypt
his
liberal
checks
had
assisted
in
many
an
excavation
and
his
knowledge
of
her
relics
was
remarkable
inserting
a
steel
paper
cutter
in
a
crack
he
deftly
pried
open
the
upper
half
of
the
mummy
front
beneath
lay
the
mass
of
wrappings
in
which
thousands
of
years
ago
the
priests
of
the
nile
had
swathed
some
lady
of
wealth
and
rank
it
was
a
woman
marvin
was
sure
from
the
inscriptions
on
her
tomb
and
he
believed
her
to
be
a
princess
the
secretary
excused
himself
and
went
to
his
room
where
his
precious
morphine
pills
were
hidden
the
old
man
left
alone
deftly
opened
the
many
layers
of
cloth
which
bound
the
ancient
form
a
faint
scent
that
was
almost
like
a
presence
came
forth
from
the
unwrapped
folds
long
lost
balms
they
were
ancient
spices
forgotten
antiseptics
of
a
great
race
that
blossomed
and
fell
thousands
of
years
before
its
time
i
smell
the
dead
centuries
whispered
marvin
to
himself
i
can
almost
feel
their
weight
the
world
was
young
when
this
woman
breathed
perhaps
she
was
pretty
and
foolish
like
my
polly
yes
and
maybe
as
stubborn
too
manetho
says
they
had
a
good
deal
to
say
in
those
days
ah
now
we
shall
see
her
face
he
had
uncovered
a
bit
of
the
mummy
forehead
when
out
of
the
bandages
fell
a
tiny
vial
marvin
quickly
picked
it
up
the
vial
was
carved
from
some
sort
of
green
crystal
in
the
shape
of
a
egyptian
bird
god
without
effort
the
stopper
came
out
and
marvin
held
the
small
bottle
to
his
nostrils
only
to
drop
it
at
the
mummy
feet
it
exhaled
the
odor
of
the
mummy
which
the
reek
of
the
centuries
intensified
a
thousand
times
it
was
too
much
for
the
old
man
he
had
overtaxed
his
feeble
vitality
and
felt
his
senses
leaving
him
with
the
entire
force
of
his
will
he
was
able
to
get
to
a
chair
into
which
he
sank
the
odor
of
the
vial
was
still
in
his
nostrils
his
eyes
were
fixed
and
stared
straight
ahead
but
he
could
see
in
a
faint
unnatural
yellow
light
that
bathed
the
room
from
the
vial
lying
at
the
mummy
feet
a
vapor
appeared
to
rise
it
floated
toward
the
swathed
figure
enveloped
it
and
seemed
to
be
absorbed
by
it
perhaps
this
is
death
thought
marvin
for
i
can
not
move
or
speak
but
something
else
moved
there
was
a
flutter
among
the
bandages
of
the
mummy
the
commotion
increased
something
was
moving
inside
the
bandages
were
becoming
loosened
they
fell
away
from
the
face
and
then
was
marvin
amazed
indeed
instead
of
the
tight
brown
skin
one
always
finds
in
these
ancient
relics
appeared
a
smooth
complexion
it
was
the
face
of
a
young
and
beautiful
woman
the
features
were
serene
as
if
in
death
but
there
was
no
sunken
nose
or
mummy
hollow
eyes
a
strand
of
black
hair
fell
down
and
the
movement
beneath
the
bandages
increased
out
of
the
folds
came
an
arm
a
woman
arm
slender
yet
rounded
an
arm
with
light
bones
and
fine
sinews
clearly
an
arm
and
hand
that
had
never
known
work
marvin
was
well
aware
that
a
arm
is
invariably
a
black
skeleton
claw
at
this
point
the
old
man
made
a
mental
note
that
he
was
not
dead
for
he
could
feel
his
own
breathing
the
arm
rapidly
and
gracefully
loosened
and
removed
wrappings
from
the
neck
and
breast
on
the
wrist
gashed
a
bracelet
made
of
linked
scarabs
the
arm
now
cast
away
the
last
covering
of
the
bosom
neck
and
shoulders
she
freed
her
left
hand
lifted
out
the
bottom
half
of
the
case
and
slid
the
wrappings
from
her
limbs
barefooted
and
clothed
only
in
a
shimmering
white
gown
that
scarcely
covered
bare
knees
and
a
white
with
a
green
serpent
head
in
front
she
stepped
somewhat
stiffly
into
the
room
slowly
she
made
several
movements
of
limbs
and
body
like
the
first
steps
of
a
dance
she
rose
on
her
toes
looked
down
at
herself
and
swayed
her
lithe
hips
it
occurred
to
marvin
that
all
this
was
by
way
of
a
graceful
little
stretch
after
a
few
thousand
years
of
sleep
marvin
now
observed
that
she
was
pauline
height
and
age
as
well
as
general
size
and
form
slightly
shorter
she
might
have
been
but
then
she
lacked
pauline
high
heels
the
general
resemblance
was
striking
except
in
the
color
of
the
eyes
and
hair
pauline
tresses
were
a
light
golden
yellow
while
this
girl
hair
was
black
as
the
hollow
of
the
sphinx
pauline
eyes
were
blue
but
she
who
stood
before
him
gazed
through
eyes
too
dark
to
guess
their
color
the
egyptian
had
found
a
little
mirror
she
patted
her
hair
adjusted
the
but
marvin
waited
in
vain
for
the
powder
puff
from
the
mirror
the
girl
eyes
wandered
to
a
painting
hanging
above
the
desk
it
was
an
excellent
likeness
of
pauline
the
resemblance
between
the
two
was
obvious
not
only
to
marvin
but
evidently
to
the
girl
she
turned
to
the
old
man
and
addressed
him
in
a
strange
language
not
one
word
did
he
recognize
yet
the
syllables
were
so
clearly
and
carefully
pronounced
that
he
felt
he
was
listening
to
an
educated
woman
some
of
the
tones
were
like
pauline
some
were
not
but
all
were
soft
sweet
modulated
the
meaning
was
clear
enough
she
wished
marvin
to
see
the
resemblance
and
she
frowned
slightly
because
the
rigid
staring
figure
did
not
respond
why
should
she
be
impatient
this
woman
of
the
pharaohs
who
had
lain
stiff
and
unresponsive
while
babylon
and
greece
and
rome
and
spain
had
risen
and
fallen
soon
she
resorted
to
pantomime
pointed
to
herself
and
the
picture
touched
her
eyes
and
nose
and
mouth
and
then
the
corresponding
painted
features
she
felt
of
her
own
jet
hair
shook
her
head
and
looked
questioningly
at
the
light
coiffure
of
pauline
she
turned
to
the
old
man
evidently
asking
if
the
painting
were
true
in
this
respect
then
she
smiled
a
smile
like
pauline
perhaps
she
was
asking
if
pauline
had
changed
the
color
of
her
hair
now
she
became
interested
in
a
book
on
the
corner
of
the
desk
with
little
musical
exclamations
of
delight
she
turned
the
printed
pages
and
appreciated
that
the
shelves
contained
hundreds
more
of
these
treasures
the
typewritten
letters
lying
about
excited
her
admiration
and
then
the
pen
and
ink
she
quickly
guessed
the
use
of
the
pen
and
ran
eagerly
to
the
mummy
case
a
moment
search
brought
forth
a
long
roll
of
papyrus
before
marvin
eyes
she
unrolled
a
scroll
covered
with
egyptian
hieroglyphics
there
were
footsteps
in
the
hall
and
the
egyptian
looked
toward
the
door
owen
entered
looked
at
marvin
searchingly
placed
him
in
a
more
comfortable
position
in
the
chair
spoke
his
name
and
walked
out
what
seemed
most
surprising
to
the
sick
man
was
his
secretary
oversight
of
the
girl
he
passed
in
front
of
her
almost
brushing
her
white
robe
and
yet
it
was
clear
that
he
did
not
see
her
but
the
egyptian
had
seen
him
and
the
sight
had
excited
her
she
seemed
desperately
anxious
to
say
something
to
marvin
something
about
pauline
the
mummy
had
a
secret
to
reveal
she
tore
the
bracelet
from
her
right
wrist
and
tried
to
force
it
into
marvin
nerveless
grasp
try
as
she
would
his
muscles
did
not
respond
there
were
voices
in
the
hallway
harry
and
pauline
were
running
downstairs
the
princess
gave
one
last
imploring
glance
at
the
paralyzed
figure
passed
her
hand
gently
over
his
forehead
then
she
stepped
quickly
back
to
the
case
harry
and
pauline
rushed
in
followed
less
hastily
by
owen
they
grasped
the
old
man
hands
and
harry
seizing
the
telephone
called
stevens
but
to
the
surprise
of
everybody
marvin
suddenly
shook
off
the
paralysis
spoke
moved
and
seemed
none
the
worse
for
his
seizure
chapter
ii
the
will
old
marvin
faculties
returned
with
a
snap
there
was
the
library
just
as
it
had
been
before
his
peculiar
seizure
his
son
harry
was
summoning
on
the
telephone
stevens
the
heart
specialist
and
pauline
his
adopted
daughter
was
on
her
knees
chafing
his
hands
and
anxiously
watching
his
face
while
owen
the
secretary
was
pouring
out
a
dose
of
his
medicine
but
the
peculiar
yellow
light
had
gone
and
what
about
the
mummy
it
stood
just
as
he
had
left
it
the
lower
half
of
the
case
was
in
place
the
upper
half
was
out
revealing
the
loosened
bandages
and
just
a
glimpse
of
the
forehead
one
strand
of
jet
black
hair
hung
down
all
was
just
as
it
was
when
the
little
vial
had
fallen
out
i
all
right
i
all
right
protested
marvin
somewhat
testily
as
he
twisted
about
in
his
chair
to
get
a
good
view
of
the
mummy
look
out
harry
do
step
on
that
little
bottle
harry
looked
down
and
picked
up
the
tiny
vial
which
had
fallen
from
the
bandages
wrapped
about
the
ancient
form
smell
of
it
his
father
ordered
harry
sniffed
it
and
remarked
that
it
smelled
musty
and
passed
it
to
pauline
the
girl
carried
it
to
her
nostrils
spin
and
again
she
looked
perplexed
well
what
do
you
think
it
is
asked
the
old
man
why
i
ca
remember
but
i
ought
to
know
i
sure
i
do
know
the
devil
you
do
muttered
her
faster
father
what
makes
you
think
you
ought
to
know
why
it
is
so
familiar
i
certain
i
smelled
it
often
before
have
i
well
if
you
have
polly
you
are
a
lot
older
than
i
am
older
than
anything
in
this
country
as
old
as
the
pyramids
that
bottle
fell
out
of
the
mummy
and
i
can
assure
you
it
has
been
there
some
three
or
four
thousand
years
when
i
smelled
of
that
bottle
it
had
a
queer
effect
on
me
i
felt
as
if
i
were
going
to
have
one
of
my
fainting
spells
and
was
glad
to
get
back
to
the
chair
it
funny
about
that
mummy
i
thought
she
came
out
and
talked
to
me
why
father
what
a
horrible
thing
sympathized
pauline
not
horrible
at
all
she
was
a
beauty
and
a
princess
she
was
interested
in
your
picture
polly
and
she
looked
like
you
too
except
let
see
yes
her
hair
was
black
jet
black
like
that
one
lock
you
see
hanging
down
oh
interrupted
pauline
i
wish
my
hair
were
black
and
i
often
dream
that
it
is
and
that
i
am
walking
around
in
a
pretty
white
pleated
dress
and
my
feet
are
bare
and
a
bracelet
on
your
wrist
your
right
wrist
questioned
marvin
eagerly
i
do
remember
pauline
replied
thoughtfully
well
we
see
if
you
had
one
and
also
whether
i
was
dreaming
or
not
announced
the
old
man
with
a
half
ashamed
look
as
he
rose
somewhat
unsteadily
to
his
feet
harry
and
pauline
tried
to
keep
him
quiet
he
brushed
their
warnings
aside
and
walked
unsteadily
to
the
mummy
let
see
its
face
suggested
harry
carelessly
no
said
his
father
i
have
an
idea
that
this
old
but
young
lady
would
not
care
to
have
us
look
at
her
but
there
is
one
thing
i
must
find
out
i
want
to
know
if
she
wears
a
bracelet
of
linked
scarabs
on
her
right
wrist
or
not
all
of
this
was
rather
a
bore
to
harry
who
lived
intensely
in
the
present
had
no
interest
in
egypt
except
that
pauline
was
born
and
adopted
as
an
orphan
baby
there
and
asked
nothing
of
the
future
except
that
it
allow
him
to
marry
this
obstinate
but
fascinating
little
creature
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
the
question
had
been
brought
up
half
an
hour
before
and
he
wanted
it
settled
at
once
harry
wished
they
would
decide
about
the
marriage
instead
of
fussing
around
with
an
old
mummy
my
son
i
venture
to
say
that
you
would
have
been
interested
in
this
young
woman
had
you
met
her
possibly
the
youth
admitted
with
a
slight
yawn
yes
continued
his
father
busily
searching
for
the
mummy
right
wrist
she
was
probably
what
you
would
call
a
peach
she
may
have
been
a
peach
in
her
day
thought
harry
but
today
a
dried
apricot
the
elder
marvin
searching
fingers
encountered
a
hard
object
it
proved
to
be
a
scarab
or
sacred
egyptian
beetle
carved
in
black
stone
did
you
ever
dream
about
that
asked
harry
chaffing
yes
i
have
replied
pauline
both
men
looked
at
her
to
see
if
she
were
serious
i
dreamed
that
i
was
very
sick
and
going
to
die
and
an
old
man
with
a
long
thin
beard
came
in
he
gave
me
a
stone
beetle
like
that
then
it
seems
to
me
they
put
it
right
on
my
chest
and
they
said
see
what
did
they
do
that
for
i
think
it
was
to
cure
me
of
something
the
matter
with
my
heart
polly
said
marvin
i
never
knew
you
had
dreams
like
this
but
are
you
sure
they
said
it
would
cure
your
heart
was
it
for
some
other
reason
pauline
thought
a
moment
while
harry
lit
a
cigarette
and
his
father
worked
his
fingers
down
toward
the
mummy
right
wrist
no
said
pauline
i
remember
now
it
was
to
cure
it
at
all
it
was
to
make
it
keep
quiet
ho
ho
laughed
harry
i
never
knew
of
any
one
making
it
flutter
much
i
guess
that
was
no
dream
harry
father
silenced
him
with
an
impatient
gesture
and
turned
to
pauline
who
was
watching
the
wind
make
cat
paws
on
the
polished
surface
of
the
hudson
river
go
on
girl
go
on
this
is
remarkable
i
have
read
of
this
custom
in
the
egyptian
of
the
dead
why
did
they
want
to
keep
your
heart
quiet
they
said
continued
pauline
dreamily
that
after
i
died
my
spirit
was
to
be
called
before
somebody
a
god
i
guess
who
would
judge
whether
i
was
good
enough
for
heaven
or
not
that
stone
beetle
was
placed
on
my
heart
to
make
it
keep
silent
and
not
tell
anything
wicked
i
might
have
done
in
life
are
dreams
crazy
things
say
harry
there
goes
a
hydroplane
the
two
young
people
hung
out
the
open
window
the
old
man
was
absorbed
too
he
had
at
last
worked
his
fingers
along
the
entire
length
of
the
mummy
right
wrist
it
was
dry
and
hard
as
any
mummy
he
had
ever
seen
but
it
bore
neither
bracelet
nor
any
ornament
whatever
well
he
said
reluctantly
it
was
all
a
dream
interesting
but
not
important
like
polly
dream
it
was
just
the
echo
of
something
i
have
read
or
seen
oh
pshaw
what
are
dreams
anyway
muttered
harry
with
impatience
dreams
said
pauline
authoritatively
dreams
are
the
bubbles
which
rise
to
the
surface
of
the
mind
when
it
cools
down
in
sleep
now
observed
harry
quietly
when
you
and
father
are
through
talking
about
mummies
and
dreams
i
wish
you
would
consider
something
that
i
am
interested
in
i
like
to
know
how
soon
you
are
going
to
marry
me
where
did
you
get
that
definition
of
dreams
polly
asked
the
old
man
from
my
story
said
pauline
proudly
both
men
at
once
remembered
that
she
had
gone
to
find
the
magazine
and
show
them
her
first
story
they
eagerly
demanded
to
see
it
pauline
picked
up
the
cosmopolitan
from
the
floor
she
had
dropped
it
in
her
agitation
at
finding
her
foster
father
had
fainted
sure
enough
there
it
was
fire
on
an
ocean
liner
by
pauline
marvin
it
was
not
the
biggest
feature
by
any
means
but
it
was
quite
a
little
story
and
there
were
several
large
stirring
illustrations
both
men
begged
her
to
read
it
to
them
but
she
modestly
declined
marvin
adjusted
his
spectacles
and
read
it
through
from
start
to
finish
frequently
looking
up
to
compliment
the
authoress
on
some
point
that
pleased
him
harry
looked
over
his
father
shoulder
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
they
were
both
held
and
even
thrilled
by
the
story
marvin
clapped
his
hands
and
stated
in
a
loud
voice
that
he
was
proud
of
her
harry
expressed
his
appreciation
by
a
hug
and
a
kiss
all
of
which
she
accepted
with
blushes
and
protests
and
er
did
they
actually
pay
you
something
for
this
asked
the
old
gentleman
oh
yes
pauline
assured
him
they
sent
me
a
check
at
once
it
paid
for
that
frock
you
told
me
was
too
extravagant
a
hundred
dollars
ventured
harry
from
the
depths
of
his
ignorance
of
things
feminine
both
pauline
and
his
father
cast
pitying
glances
at
him
look
here
young
man
said
the
elder
marvin
whoever
led
you
to
believe
that
you
could
buy
dresses
for
a
girl
like
polly
at
a
hundred
dollars
if
you
contemplate
matrimony
on
any
such
deluded
basis
as
that
you
had
better
back
out
now
before
it
too
late
is
that
so
polly
why
father
protested
the
youth
what
do
i
care
what
her
dresses
cost
polly
knows
everything
i
have
or
ever
make
is
hers
and
i
think
of
a
more
satisfactory
way
of
spending
it
than
on
her
that
fine
harry
laughed
the
father
you
have
just
the
ideal
frame
of
mind
and
the
proper
sentiments
for
a
modern
husband
you
will
find
too
that
women
are
very
reasonable
if
a
man
gives
his
wife
all
he
makes
plus
the
vote
and
lets
her
do
just
as
she
pleases
usually
let
him
live
in
the
same
house
with
her
and
even
get
up
early
enough
to
see
him
at
breakfast
once
in
a
while
i
agree
to
everything
declared
harry
with
the
reckless
abandon
of
youth
in
love
but
i
want
to
know
how
soon
polly
is
going
to
marry
me
pauline
who
had
said
nothing
in
answer
to
the
preliminary
skirmishes
now
recognized
the
main
attack
and
opened
up
in
reply
i
told
you
i
would
marry
harry
some
time
but
not
for
a
year
or
two
you
admitted
that
a
writer
ought
to
see
life
in
order
to
write
well
so
there
you
are
i
must
have
a
year
or
two
of
adventure
there
are
a
thousand
things
i
want
to
do
and
see
before
i
settle
down
as
harry
marvin
suppose
we
say
two
years
harry
staggered
back
as
if
from
a
blow
two
years
how
preposterous
he
could
live
that
long
without
pauline
in
vain
he
hurled
his
protests
and
objections
she
stood
sweet
unruffled
sympathetic
but
as
firm
as
the
rocky
mountains
the
old
man
listened
to
the
debate
for
some
time
without
comment
then
he
pressed
a
button
on
his
desk
in
answer
came
raymond
owen
the
secretary
he
had
shown
the
good
taste
to
retire
from
the
library
as
soon
as
the
conversation
became
personal
from
the
vantage
point
of
a
room
across
the
hall
he
had
been
quietly
listening
and
decided
it
a
rather
unfruitful
piece
of
eavesdropping
he
appeared
the
faithful
deferent
employee
in
every
line
as
he
entered
come
here
raymond
directed
the
old
man
as
sharply
as
a
commanding
officer
and
you
harry
and
you
pauline
they
obeyed
and
quickly
lined
up
before
his
chair
with
rather
surprised
faces
for
marvin
only
called
them
pauline
and
harry
when
he
was
very
serious
raymond
this
is
the
situation
my
son
loves
pauline
and
wants
to
marry
her
at
once
i
have
no
objection
in
fact
i
would
like
to
see
them
united
at
once
but
pauline
demurs
she
loves
harry
but
feels
she
ought
to
have
two
years
to
see
life
before
settling
down
two
years
is
too
much
i
should
say
so
growled
harry
but
as
my
old
grandfather
who
has
been
gone
these
forty
years
now
used
to
say
a
woman
will
she
will
and
when
she
wo
she
wo
and
there
an
end
o
i
do
blame
her
for
wanting
to
have
her
own
way
it
the
only
plan
i
found
to
get
along
in
this
world
but
you
ca
have
all
your
own
way
you
have
to
compromise
so
polly
is
going
to
have
one
year
that
enough
during
that
year
raymond
i
going
to
put
her
in
your
care
you
are
older
and
more
prudent
than
either
polly
or
harry
and
will
see
that
she
comes
to
no
harm
take
her
anywhere
she
wants
to
go
around
the
world
if
she
likes
to
do
anything
within
reason
do
you
agree
marvin
looked
at
owen
who
accepted
the
duty
as
calmly
as
if
it
were
an
order
to
post
a
letter
polly
also
consented
after
a
hesitation
harry
alone
protested
and
argued
it
was
a
hopeless
case
and
he
yielded
to
overwhelming
odds
this
matter
settled
marvin
mind
returned
to
the
mummy
and
his
curious
delusion
that
it
had
come
to
life
while
owen
perused
pauline
story
and
that
willful
young
woman
herself
tried
to
cheer
up
her
disconsolate
lover
the
old
man
returned
to
the
mummy
he
had
searched
for
the
bracelet
on
the
right
wrist
but
after
all
perhaps
the
egyptian
might
have
slipped
it
onto
her
left
wrist
in
her
hurry
to
get
back
there
it
is
he
shouted
suddenly
there
it
is
the
bracelet
she
wore
it
on
her
wrist
and
he
told
her
to
give
it
to
polly
marvin
held
in
his
hand
a
bracelet
of
scarabs
linked
together
it
looked
to
him
to
the
very
one
the
reincarnated
mummy
had
worn
harry
and
pauline
in
wonder
came
to
him
and
it
was
well
they
did
the
excitement
and
exertion
had
again
overstrained
his
failing
energies
he
tottered
and
they
were
just
in
time
to
save
him
from
a
fall
it
was
another
of
his
fainting
spells
and
they
lowered
him
gently
into
his
chair
but
the
old
man
was
not
unconscious
yet
feebly
he
repeated
to
pauline
wear
this
bracelet
wear
it
always
promise
pauline
promised
and
slipped
it
on
her
wrist
without
more
than
glancing
at
it
the
old
man
eyes
closed
and
it
was
clear
that
this
faint
was
more
serious
than
his
others
harry
about
to
telephone
for
stevens
again
was
greatly
relieved
to
see
the
physician
stride
into
the
room
there
was
hardly
need
of
the
stethoscope
to
tell
him
the
end
was
near
even
before
the
old
man
was
undressed
and
in
bed
stevens
had
prepared
and
administered
a
hypodermic
the
patient
eyelids
fluttered
and
stevens
listened
to
the
faintly
moving
lips
the
will
called
the
doctor
what
about
the
will
he
glanced
at
every
one
but
nobody
knew
a
shadow
of
anxiety
passed
over
the
features
of
the
dying
millionaire
stevens
could
see
that
something
of
serious
importance
was
on
the
old
man
mind
something
of
importance
about
his
vast
property
once
more
he
listened
and
then
hastily
drawing
out
his
prescription
pad
and
fountain
pen
he
wrote
a
few
sentences
at
the
dying
man
dictation
while
the
patient
rallied
and
opened
his
eyes
the
physician
held
the
blank
before
his
patient
who
read
it
through
and
nodded
stevens
then
placed
the
pen
in
the
trembling
fingers
and
guided
his
signature
a
moment
more
and
the
physician
had
signed
it
as
a
witness
and
the
butler
had
done
the
same
the
old
manufacturer
died
as
he
had
lived
the
will
written
on
stevens
prescription
pad
was
given
to
owen
he
went
to
his
room
and
examined
it
it
read
bodley
stevens
rx
i
bequeath
half
my
estate
to
my
son
harry
the
remainder
to
my
adopted
daughter
pauline
to
be
held
in
trust
until
her
marriage
by
my
secretary
raymond
owen
then
followed
the
signature
of
the
deceased
and
that
of
the
two
witnesses
in
vain
owen
looked
for
the
handsome
bequest
to
the
faithful
secretary
this
was
a
bitter
disappointment
and
he
considered
for
a
moment
the
advisability
of
destroying
the
will
this
would
make
valid
one
of
the
earlier
wills
in
which
he
knew
he
had
not
been
forgotten
the
folly
of
such
a
course
became
evident
after
a
few
moments
thought
stevens
the
butler
and
several
others
knew
the
contents
of
the
document
it
was
so
simple
that
its
meaning
could
hardly
be
confused
or
forgotten
and
every
one
knew
it
was
in
his
keeping
it
occurred
to
owen
that
quite
likely
such
a
hasty
will
written
by
a
doctor
unskilled
in
law
might
not
be
accepted
by
the
courts
early
the
next
morning
owen
suspended
his
work
of
answering
telegrams
of
condolence
long
enough
to
make
a
hurried
trip
to
lower
manhattan
where
the
late
stanford
marvin
lawyers
had
offices
in
vain
the
great
lawyer
cudgeled
his
brains
for
some
flaw
the
will
ought
to
be
wrong
but
it
was
the
meaning
was
so
clear
that
even
a
court
could
misunderstand
it
and
the
fortune
was
left
to
his
natural
beneficiaries
the
lawyer
heaved
a
sigh
and
said
plaintively
too
bad
too
bad
why
did
they
call
me
then
this
will
is
not
valid
asked
owen
oh
no
it
will
hold
but
what
a
pity
that
such
a
great
man
last
will
and
testament
should
be
such
an
well
so
well
this
instrument
is
not
worthy
of
conveying
such
a
great
estate
he
contemptuously
slipped
the
simple
document
into
an
envelope
and
placed
it
in
his
safe
owen
picked
up
his
hat
but
hesitated
at
the
door
a
question
was
forming
in
his
mind
and
with
it
a
hope
wilmerding
he
asked
finally
in
case
miss
marvin
does
not
marry
who
would
have
charge
of
the
estate
i
should
say
replied
the
lawyer
in
reply
to
your
question
that
the
estate
would
be
held
in
trust
by
you
returning
to
the
house
and
entering
the
library
owen
was
confronted
by
the
unwelcome
spectacle
of
montgomery
hicks
generally
known
as
mug
hicks
with
his
gaudy
attire
and
ugly
face
was
always
an
affront
to
the
eye
but
to
owen
he
was
a
terror
for
he
held
the
power
of
blackmail
over
the
secretary
owen
shrank
at
the
sight
of
his
enemy
but
immediately
took
courage
though
marvin
death
had
left
the
secretary
no
legacy
it
had
also
robbed
the
blackmailer
of
his
power
hicks
advanced
with
what
he
intended
to
be
a
winning
smile
and
extended
a
hot
fat
hand
i
see
the
old
man
has
croaked
and
i
was
just
dropping
in
to
talk
business
hicks
newsboy
voice
growled
out
hicks
said
owen
keeping
his
hand
in
his
pocket
if
you
came
here
to
get
your
money
out
of
the
legacy
old
man
marvin
was
to
leave
me
well
you
wo
get
it
and
you
never
will
get
it
marvin
did
leave
me
a
cent
so
there
is
nothing
for
you
to
get
he
did
leave
me
a
job
in
his
will
a
job
that
will
last
for
a
year
and
neither
you
nor
any
one
else
can
force
me
out
of
that
job
you
ca
blackmail
me
any
more
at
the
end
of
the
year
what
becomes
of
you
asked
hicks
then
i
get
a
position
somewhere
else
but
that
is
none
of
your
business
you
do
want
a
position
owen
a
position
calls
for
work
you
do
like
hard
work
any
more
then
i
do
you
ca
stand
work
much
longer
either
look
at
your
eyes
and
your
skin
how
many
grains
do
you
take
a
day
anyway
i
have
touched
a
grain
of
morphine
in
six
months
lied
owen
but
get
out
of
my
way
you
ca
get
anything
out
of
me
and
you
blackmail
me
if
you
come
to
this
house
again
i
have
you
thrown
out
just
a
minute
said
hicks
as
pleasantly
as
he
could
straining
his
coarse
features
into
the
unaccustomed
position
of
a
smile
i
come
to
get
money
out
of
you
i
know
all
about
the
will
what
i
came
for
was
to
help
you
and
give
you
a
tip
you
and
i
can
make
a
lot
of
easy
money
together
you
got
the
opportunity
and
i
got
the
brains
now
to
show
you
i
your
friend
look
at
this
hicks
handed
him
a
paper
which
owen
read
with
surprise
it
was
a
receipt
in
full
for
all
owen
owed
owen
put
it
in
his
pocket
that
right
keep
it
you
and
i
are
going
to
be
so
rich
before
long
that
a
matter
of
a
thousand
or
two
would
be
worth
talking
about
between
friends
owen
had
been
under
the
thumb
of
this
man
had
feared
and
hated
him
and
hoped
for
the
day
when
he
might
sneer
in
his
face
and
defy
him
this
was
the
time
and
yet
he
felt
hicks
had
something
to
offer
he
was
in
temporary
charge
of
millions
there
should
be
there
must
be
some
way
to
make
this
control
permanent
or
else
to
delve
into
these
millions
while
they
were
in
his
care
as
hicks
hinted
this
was
an
opportunity
and
he
needed
not
brains
but
rather
experience
and
advice
owen
had
been
a
rascal
on
a
short
time
why
not
take
a
partner
like
this
man
hicks
he
would
prevent
mistakes
and
mistakes
are
all
a
criminal
need
fear
owen
fingered
uneasily
the
paper
hicks
had
put
in
his
hand
he
drew
it
out
of
his
pocket
yes
it
was
a
receipt
in
full
for
all
that
owen
owed
the
scoundrel
what
could
be
hicks
scheme
owen
turned
a
puzzled
and
worried
gaze
upon
his
companion
hicks
observed
him
closely
read
the
misgivings
in
owen
mind
and
drawing
close
whispered
something
in
the
latter
ear
but
owen
nerves
trembled
at
the
thought
he
pushed
hicks
aside
and
walked
rapidly
out
of
the
room
calling
over
his
shoulder
i
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
you
i
do
want
you
to
come
near
me
or
speak
to
me
again
i
done
with
you
when
you
want
me
you
know
where
to
find
me
was
hicks
parting
answer
chapter
iii
pauline
taxes
the
first
trick
all
right
i
do
it
growled
harry
marvin
with
the
air
of
a
martyr
going
to
the
stake
i
do
it
for
your
sake
polly
well
you
better
begin
to
get
ready
said
pauline
blithely
i
climb
into
a
frock
coat
and
endure
an
hour
or
two
of
this
afternoon
tea
chatter
promised
harry
but
first
you
must
talk
sense
with
me
for
a
few
minutes
oh
harry
spoke
pauline
softly
i
know
what
means
you
want
to
argue
about
my
year
of
adventure
now
lets
not
argue
let
just
be
happy
you
know
i
love
you
and
i
know
you
love
me
and
that
ought
to
be
enough
this
year
will
be
gone
before
you
know
it
i
going
to
begin
it
right
away
just
to
please
you
the
sooner
it
starts
the
sooner
it
will
be
over
begin
it
said
harry
why
a
month
of
it
is
gone
now
but
it
all
nonsense
polly
if
you
love
me
you
are
going
to
give
up
this
crazy
idea
a
maid
bringing
the
card
of
miss
lucille
hamlin
interrupted
harry
she
was
the
first
of
the
afternoon
tea
party
polly
hurried
harry
off
to
dress
and
of
course
he
had
no
further
chance
to
talk
sense
until
the
door
had
closed
on
the
last
guest
then
he
pounced
upon
her
but
pauline
sweetly
stubborn
cheerfully
unyielding
insisted
on
carrying
out
her
father
promise
to
the
letter
raymond
owen
the
secretary
of
the
late
marvin
had
thought
it
important
to
overhear
this
argument
and
finally
to
walk
into
the
library
where
the
debate
was
going
on
if
the
adventures
were
to
start
he
had
an
idea
for
a
beginning
the
words
of
hicks
the
blackmailer
had
been
in
his
mind
for
some
thirty
days
and
were
beginning
to
bear
fruit
he
had
soon
reached
the
point
of
hoping
almost
praying
something
would
happen
to
pauline
that
he
might
be
left
in
control
of
her
estate
during
the
last
few
days
owen
had
progressed
from
merely
hoping
to
readiness
to
help
his
wish
to
come
true
harry
instantly
appealed
to
the
secretary
to
dissuade
pauline
there
was
no
doubt
that
owen
had
some
influence
over
the
girl
in
years
gone
by
before
owen
had
taken
to
the
drug
pauline
had
sought
him
out
in
many
a
time
of
perplexity
and
learned
to
rely
on
his
tactful
advice
to
the
surprise
of
the
young
master
of
the
house
owen
made
no
attempt
to
dissuade
very
unobtrusively
he
pointed
out
that
for
many
years
he
had
been
accustomed
to
carry
out
the
wishes
of
harry
father
and
that
he
was
bound
to
fulfill
his
last
wish
in
the
same
way
raymond
you
a
dear
laughed
pauline
let
think
of
something
thrilling
to
do
right
off
have
you
any
idea
no
lied
owen
i
had
given
the
matter
any
thought
we
might
look
at
a
newspaper
and
see
what
happening
owen
had
a
paper
with
him
and
the
three
examined
it
together
owen
pretended
to
discover
that
an
aviation
meet
was
about
to
be
held
his
idea
for
which
harry
promptly
hated
him
was
to
induce
some
aviator
to
take
pauline
as
a
passenger
many
of
the
races
called
for
carrying
a
passenger
harry
made
a
few
objections
but
the
speed
with
which
they
were
overruled
showed
that
he
had
no
standing
in
this
court
so
harry
subsided
but
he
thought
very
hard
several
things
were
becoming
evident
to
harry
one
was
that
this
year
to
see
life
and
have
adventures
was
actually
going
to
take
place
and
no
opposition
on
his
part
would
stop
it
it
was
also
clear
that
if
he
hoped
to
control
pauline
adventures
in
any
way
it
would
be
by
the
use
of
his
wits
matching
them
against
pauline
and
the
secretary
when
pauline
and
owen
decided
upon
the
aeroplane
ride
harry
contented
himself
with
remarking
that
he
would
have
to
see
about
it
both
chuckled
when
he
said
it
pauline
outwardly
and
owen
inwardly
then
they
had
dinner
under
the
round
glassy
eye
of
aunt
cornelia
aunt
cornelia
was
an
elderly
maiden
relative
of
harry
who
had
arrived
with
others
for
the
funeral
and
made
the
brilliant
discovery
that
since
marvin
death
the
social
situation
as
she
termed
it
at
the
marvin
house
had
become
impossible
it
seemed
according
to
aunt
cornelia
that
a
young
man
and
a
young
woman
of
impressionable
age
living
in
the
same
house
unchaperoned
constituted
an
impossible
social
situation
either
pauline
or
harry
must
move
out
or
someone
must
be
installed
as
chaperon
of
course
the
chaperon
was
the
least
of
the
three
evils
and
aunt
cornelia
being
the
discoverer
of
the
job
was
elected
to
fill
it
harry
ordered
a
bottle
of
wine
with
his
dinner
though
he
actually
drank
very
little
this
unusual
event
created
no
little
consternation
harry
i
did
know
you
drank
said
pauline
i
am
just
beginning
you
see
now
that
i
must
take
over
affairs
and
mix
with
men
of
the
world
i
ought
to
get
a
little
experience
in
things
see
life
and
know
what
what
after
dinner
harry
casually
asked
if
pauline
thought
her
adventures
would
lead
her
to
paris
pauline
thought
it
likely
whereat
harry
remarked
that
he
might
see
her
over
there
i
have
been
to
paris
since
i
was
a
kid
and
i
really
ought
to
see
it
do
you
think
yes
agreed
pauline
without
enthusiasm
but
wait
until
we
are
married
and
we
do
paris
together
no
polly
that
wo
do
i
sorry
but
as
you
say
you
ca
see
life
after
you
married
and
settled
down
so
i
have
to
do
paris
alone
harry
are
you
sure
you
love
me
pauline
whispered
polly
i
know
it
and
everybody
else
knows
it
except
you
get
owen
he
a
notary
public
and
i
take
an
oath
before
him
that
you
have
been
the
only
girl
in
all
the
world
are
now
and
ever
will
be
world
without
end
amen
and
i
love
you
harry
said
pauline
lowering
her
eyes
until
he
saw
only
the
silky
lashes
why
polly
that
the
first
time
you
ever
volunteered
that
information
yes
harry
i
love
you
too
much
to
let
you
go
to
paris
paris
ca
hurt
me
unless
i
let
it
hurt
me
harry
you
wo
be
quite
the
same
sort
of
boy
when
you
come
back
from
paris
will
you
promise
not
to
go
until
we
are
married
will
you
promise
not
to
go
on
this
trip
of
adventure
why
should
i
demanded
pauline
because
you
wo
ever
be
quite
the
same
sort
of
girl
when
you
come
back
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
when
the
big
touring
car
rolled
up
to
the
front
door
to
got
pauline
and
owen
harry
was
hurt
that
he
had
not
been
consulted
pauline
belated
invitation
to
go
with
them
to
the
aviation
field
in
the
automobile
was
declined
away
went
the
big
car
to
the
fine
stretch
of
roads
where
it
made
short
work
of
the
distance
to
the
aviation
grounds
owen
made
a
complete
canvass
of
the
hangars
and
soon
accounted
for
every
machine
entered
in
the
race
for
the
next
day
from
all
but
one
of
the
aviators
he
obtained
a
flat
refusal
not
for
money
or
any
other
consideration
would
they
take
a
strange
woman
as
a
passenger
the
only
exception
was
a
frenchman
whose
hesitation
in
declining
led
owen
to
further
argument
at
the
last
moment
pauline
impatient
at
the
suspense
entered
the
frenchman
hangar
and
added
her
blandishments
to
owen
financial
inducements
the
gallant
foreigner
succumbed
and
a
bargain
was
struck
he
exhibited
his
tame
bird
of
steel
and
wood
and
cloth
with
the
utter
pride
of
a
mother
showing
off
her
only
child
the
aviator
fingers
touched
one
of
the
wires
and
the
easy
smile
left
his
face
he
turned
to
his
mechanics
and
sharp
words
followed
a
moment
later
one
of
his
assistants
was
at
work
tightening
the
wire
owen
eyes
scarcely
left
the
wire
and
when
the
opportunity
arose
he
questioned
the
mechanic
as
to
what
would
happen
if
that
particular
steel
strand
should
fail
during
flight
the
foreigner
explained
frankly
that
the
aeroplane
would
capsize
and
plunge
to
the
earth
but
he
assured
owen
that
no
such
thing
would
happen
as
he
had
just
tightened
the
wire
in
question
and
would
make
another
inspection
after
the
practice
flight
that
afternoon
all
the
way
home
owen
thoughts
were
of
that
wire
and
what
it
would
mean
to
him
in
the
meanwhile
harry
after
watching
the
car
depart
toward
hempstead
concluded
to
follow
he
went
to
the
picturesque
private
garage
behind
the
marvin
mansion
and
soon
was
following
in
the
tracks
of
the
bigger
car
arrived
on
the
field
he
recognized
pauline
car
and
awaited
patiently
until
he
saw
it
drive
away
then
he
interviewed
the
aviator
and
learned
of
the
proposed
trip
on
the
morrow
harry
french
was
nothing
to
boast
of
nor
was
the
frenchman
english
but
they
managed
to
have
a
long
and
in
the
end
a
heated
argument
the
birdman
said
he
had
given
his
word
to
a
beautiful
lady
and
that
settled
it
besides
there
was
no
danger
in
his
wonderful
machine
had
he
not
flown
upside
down
and
done
all
the
things
the
great
pegoud
himself
had
done
as
you
americans
say
let
see
what
is
your
idiom
one
of
his
mechanics
prompted
him
ah
yes
he
said
with
a
smile
i
believe
the
proper
expression
is
should
worry
harry
threw
up
his
hands
and
went
home
as
he
buzzed
his
horn
outside
the
garage
the
door
was
opened
by
the
marvin
chauffeur
with
a
telegram
in
his
hand
the
chauffeur
wife
was
sick
and
he
wanted
a
couple
of
days
leave
of
absence
harry
granted
it
instantly
that
evening
he
made
no
mention
of
either
the
chauffeur
absence
or
his
trip
to
the
field
pauline
thought
she
was
teasing
harry
by
saying
nothing
of
her
plans
she
was
sure
he
was
eaten
up
with
curiosity
to
know
the
result
of
her
visit
and
admired
his
ability
as
she
thought
to
conceal
it
owen
spent
a
nervous
evening
he
walked
out
soon
after
dinner
and
from
a
telephone
booth
called
up
a
friend
in
the
insurance
business
to
the
secretary
surprise
and
disappointment
he
learned
that
the
percentage
of
accidents
to
aviators
had
become
comparatively
small
passengers
were
particularly
fortunate
the
friend
even
agreed
to
obtain
accident
insurance
for
any
one
at
a
reasonable
premium
if
aeroplanes
had
become
reasonably
safe
the
chance
of
pauline
being
killed
during
the
flight
on
the
following
day
was
insignificant
he
must
give
up
all
hope
of
wealth
from
the
permanent
control
of
her
estate
as
the
evening
wore
on
owen
began
to
feel
how
he
had
unconsciously
relied
on
this
hope
he
doubled
his
evening
dose
of
morphine
but
it
neither
soothed
his
disappointment
nor
brought
him
sleep
hour
after
hour
during
the
night
his
sleepless
eyes
seemed
to
see
that
loose
wire
which
the
mechanic
had
explained
to
be
so
vitally
important
he
could
see
in
imagination
the
machine
flying
off
into
the
clouds
with
pauline
in
it
he
could
see
it
suddenly
waver
dip
and
plunge
to
the
earth
in
his
mind
eye
he
saw
himself
rushing
to
the
wreck
lifting
out
the
girl
crushed
form
wildly
calling
for
a
doctor
and
exulting
all
the
time
that
she
was
beyond
human
aid
about
two
owen
fell
into
a
doze
and
in
that
doze
came
one
of
his
vivid
opium
dreams
he
beheld
hicks
enter
his
bedroom
it
was
not
hicks
the
blackmailer
but
hicks
the
counselor
who
had
told
owen
how
he
might
become
rich
hicks
was
speaking
to
him
in
a
sort
of
noiseless
voice
very
different
from
his
usual
tones
he
spoke
in
a
sort
of
shells
or
husks
of
words
the
consonants
were
there
but
the
vowels
were
lacking
yet
he
heard
as
plainly
as
if
the
man
had
shouted
hicks
advised
him
to
be
a
man
to
show
courage
for
once
to
risk
something
and
then
reap
the
reward
forever
afterward
take
your
motorcycle
ride
to
the
aviation
field
before
daylight
file
that
wire
half
through
and
fate
will
take
care
of
the
rest
but
owen
lacked
the
nerve
he
feared
that
he
would
be
seen
sneaking
onto
the
field
at
night
or
at
daybreak
hicks
replied
that
the
field
was
deserted
at
this
hour
owen
then
insisted
that
the
aeroplane
would
be
guarded
and
even
if
it
were
not
locked
in
its
hangar
the
first
rasp
of
a
file
on
the
wire
would
call
the
attention
of
some
one
on
guard
no
it
was
too
much
owen
could
not
do
it
instead
he
made
a
counter
suggestion
that
hicks
should
undertake
the
task
since
he
was
so
certain
of
its
success
for
his
part
the
secretary
agreed
to
divide
all
that
the
estate
might
be
made
to
yield
him
owen
like
everybody
else
had
seen
many
strange
things
in
dreams
but
never
had
he
known
of
any
character
in
a
dream
admitting
or
even
suggesting
that
he
was
a
dream
yet
this
was
just
what
hicks
did
i
would
owen
i
would
do
it
in
a
minute
if
i
were
talking
to
you
but
this
is
me
at
all
i
only
a
dream
in
reality
i
sound
asleep
in
a
hotel
on
upper
broadway
where
i
am
dreaming
that
i
am
talking
to
you
tomorrow
morning
i
remember
enough
of
this
dream
to
make
me
go
down
to
the
aviation
field
with
a
sort
of
premonition
that
pauline
is
going
to
be
killed
in
an
aeroplane
how
did
you
know
about
that
wire
and
that
she
is
going
to
fly
tomorrow
asked
owen
i
do
know
that
said
the
phantom
hicks
frankly
in
his
empty
voice
there
is
a
third
party
in
this
and
i
do
know
who
he
is
or
much
about
him
except
that
he
is
not
a
living
being
he
seems
to
be
somebody
from
the
past
a
priest
of
some
old
religion
i
ought
to
have
studied
about
when
i
was
at
school
i
do
know
what
his
motive
is
but
he
is
with
us
he
wants
her
killed
for
some
reason
he
brought
this
dream
of
me
to
you
so
i
could
explain
you
need
worry
about
the
man
on
guard
over
the
aeroplanes
that
man
wo
wake
up
no
matter
how
much
noise
you
make
how
do
you
know
owen
asked
he
knows
replied
hicks
because
he
has
transferred
the
effects
of
your
morphine
from
your
astral
body
to
his
that
how
he
knows
you
ought
to
know
too
because
you
have
taken
almost
enough
of
the
drug
to
kill
you
tonight
and
yet
this
is
the
first
time
you
have
even
closed
your
eyes
you
better
let
him
help
us
and
file
that
wire
as
he
advises
i
going
now
you
will
wake
up
in
a
moment
this
priest
man
told
me
after
i
had
given
you
the
message
to
drop
this
out
of
my
hand
and
the
dream
would
end
so
here
goes
goodbye
owen
saw
hicks
hold
his
hand
over
a
table
and
drop
a
small
black
shiny
object
upon
it
as
it
dropped
hicks
vanished
and
owen
awoke
he
heard
a
sharp
snap
and
saw
something
black
and
shiny
on
the
table
for
a
moment
the
secretary
sat
quietly
in
his
chair
staring
at
the
table
and
making
sure
that
he
was
no
longer
dreaming
then
he
examined
the
black
object
it
was
the
scarab
which
old
marvin
had
removed
from
the
folds
of
the
mummy
an
image
of
the
beetle
which
egypt
held
sacred
carved
in
black
stone
owen
had
not
noticed
the
scarab
before
his
short
nap
and
he
could
not
account
for
its
presence
in
his
room
anyway
a
little
later
he
donned
his
suit
downstairs
noiselessly
went
out
by
a
back
door
and
was
soon
trundling
his
big
motorcycle
from
the
garage
he
was
careful
to
push
it
out
of
the
marvin
premises
onto
the
highway
before
lighting
his
lamp
and
starting
arriving
at
the
field
just
at
dawn
owen
found
it
as
deserted
as
the
spectral
hicks
had
promised
from
the
tool
kit
of
his
he
took
two
files
of
different
shapes
and
a
pair
of
pliers
and
walked
briskly
and
fearlessly
over
the
uneven
ground
to
the
hangars
all
were
closed
except
one
and
that
one
contained
the
french
machine
in
which
pauline
was
to
ascend
the
secretary
knew
that
this
hangar
would
be
open
he
knew
in
advance
that
he
would
find
a
mechanic
on
guard
and
sound
asleep
whether
real
or
unreal
awake
or
asleep
the
business
of
the
moment
was
the
filing
of
that
wire
owen
recognized
it
readily
and
found
it
not
to
be
a
single
wire
as
he
supposed
but
a
slender
cable
composed
of
many
strands
these
strands
resisted
his
file
and
even
the
clipper
attached
to
his
pliers
after
what
seemed
an
hour
work
he
had
weakened
or
broken
enough
of
the
metal
threads
so
that
the
cable
stretched
perceptibly
at
that
point
to
do
more
might
cause
the
cable
to
break
at
once
and
betray
what
had
been
done
owen
hurriedly
returned
to
his
machine
had
dashed
back
through
the
beautiful
morning
air
to
the
marvin
home
servants
were
stirring
in
their
rooms
and
the
gardener
was
engaged
in
shaking
some
sort
of
powder
from
a
can
onto
a
bare
spot
on
the
front
lawn
he
glanced
up
at
owen
without
surprise
for
these
early
rides
were
known
to
be
an
old
habit
of
the
secretary
owen
took
the
machine
to
the
garage
satisfied
that
there
was
nothing
guilty
in
his
appearance
or
the
gardener
would
have
noted
it
stepping
out
of
the
garage
he
met
harry
and
could
not
help
starting
perceptibly
harry
looked
him
in
the
eye
and
there
was
nothing
for
owen
to
do
but
stare
steadily
back
you
are
up
very
early
owen
said
harry
looking
at
the
dust
on
the
motor
yes
i
been
for
a
long
ride
i
think
the
morning
air
does
me
good
you
do
look
well
owen
why
do
you
go
to
bed
today
i
take
polly
to
the
meet
no
thanks
i
would
miss
seeing
miss
pauline
fly
said
owen
firmly
chapter
iv
owen
wins
the
first
game
harry
marvin
entered
the
little
private
garage
back
of
the
marvin
mansion
locked
the
door
and
drew
the
shades
of
the
small
windows
there
were
only
two
automobiles
in
the
garage
one
was
the
big
six
cylinder
touring
car
in
which
pauline
and
owen
had
made
their
trip
the
day
before
to
the
aviation
field
the
other
was
the
runabout
that
harry
had
driven
over
the
same
ground
just
behind
them
having
made
sure
that
nobody
was
about
harry
lifted
up
the
hood
of
the
touring
car
and
without
the
slightest
provocation
attacked
it
with
a
wrench
he
removed
the
carburetor
took
it
to
pieces
lifted
out
the
hollow
metal
float
and
deliberately
made
two
punctures
in
it
then
he
tossed
the
dismembered
parts
upon
a
work
bench
and
was
about
to
operate
on
the
runabout
when
he
heard
voices
outside
he
was
barely
in
time
to
unlock
the
door
and
be
found
busily
working
on
the
car
when
pauline
entered
she
had
just
learned
of
the
absence
harry
volunteered
the
additional
bad
news
that
the
big
car
was
out
of
order
like
every
disappointed
woman
she
insisted
on
knowing
exactly
what
was
wrong
harry
told
her
with
many
long
technical
details
and
not
knowing
at
all
what
he
was
talking
about
she
had
to
be
satisfied
could
he
fix
it
in
time
to
get
her
to
the
aviation
field
before
the
race
well
that
depended
partly
on
whether
she
would
go
away
and
not
bother
him
until
breakfast
pauline
could
and
she
certainly
would
refrain
from
bothering
him
never
before
had
harry
found
her
a
bother
nor
for
that
matter
had
any
other
man
in
her
recollection
out
she
went
with
more
color
than
usual
in
her
pink
cheeks
and
the
light
of
battle
in
her
eyes
by
george
i
got
to
play
my
cards
carefully
thought
harry
as
he
contemplated
the
runabout
it
was
evident
that
he
had
designs
on
the
health
of
the
also
but
he
felt
the
necessity
of
subtlety
in
this
case
he
could
not
assassinate
it
boldly
by
tearing
out
a
vital
organ
as
he
had
done
to
the
bigger
car
this
runabout
must
die
a
slow
lingering
death
how
was
he
to
do
it
his
first
idea
was
to
weaken
the
tires
and
invite
blowouts
on
the
road
but
this
could
not
be
done
with
certainty
and
some
kind
friend
might
supply
him
with
new
tires
a
more
promising
idea
was
to
drain
the
engine
of
its
oil
knowing
that
sooner
or
later
the
pistons
would
run
dry
and
stick
such
a
proceeding
would
ruin
the
engine
and
harry
was
too
good
a
mechanic
to
spoil
a
first
rate
engine
especially
one
built
by
his
father
he
would
as
soon
think
of
hamstringing
a
faithful
horse
a
better
plan
soon
came
to
him
and
put
him
into
action
it
soon
had
him
flat
on
his
back
under
the
car
boring
a
hole
in
the
bottom
of
the
gasoline
tank
when
the
of
the
car
began
to
trickle
out
in
a
stream
he
stopped
the
hole
with
a
small
wooden
peg
the
young
man
now
frowned
at
the
only
remaining
vehicle
which
had
not
received
his
attention
owen
motorcycle
harry
went
to
the
hose
used
for
washing
down
the
cards
and
collected
a
little
water
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
with
the
other
hand
he
removed
the
cap
from
the
motorcycle
tank
and
allowed
two
or
three
drops
of
water
to
mingle
with
the
gasoline
this
done
harry
let
down
his
sleeves
washed
his
hands
and
sauntered
in
to
breakfast
with
the
unwelcome
announcement
that
the
big
car
was
for
the
day
at
least
beyond
human
aid
there
was
a
flicker
of
suspicion
in
owen
sallow
face
at
the
news
he
wondered
if
harry
had
disabled
the
touring
car
that
he
might
ride
alone
with
pauline
i
am
afraid
said
harry
quietly
that
you
will
have
to
ride
in
the
runabout
alone
with
me
polly
it
rather
hard
on
raymond
but
i
guess
he
must
go
on
his
motorcycle
or
by
train
oh
i
think
you
wrecked
it
on
purpose
said
pauline
without
the
slightest
suspicion
that
she
was
stating
the
truth
owen
worried
by
vague
misgivings
about
harry
looked
into
the
tank
of
the
runabout
to
make
sure
that
it
was
full
and
then
scurried
away
on
his
two
wheeled
mount
he
considered
waiting
until
the
runabout
was
ready
to
start
and
keeping
the
machine
in
sight
but
it
seemed
wiser
to
be
on
the
field
where
he
could
make
sure
the
frenchman
would
not
forget
his
bargain
nor
start
before
pauline
arrived
pauline
was
ready
with
such
suddenness
that
it
gave
her
the
novel
experience
of
waiting
for
harry
she
bad
not
forgotten
that
her
lover
had
asked
her
not
to
bother
him
while
he
worked
on
the
car
after
that
slight
to
her
pride
the
young
lady
would
rather
die
than
go
near
the
garage
while
he
was
in
it
during
the
next
five
minutes
unpleasant
doubts
entered
her
mind
what
could
this
indifference
and
neglect
mean
she
had
looked
upon
harry
ever
since
his
return
from
college
as
a
personal
possession
of
course
technically
he
was
hers
until
she
married
him
but
if
he
were
not
her
property
at
least
she
had
an
option
on
the
handsome
youth
until
such
time
as
she
saw
fit
to
either
take
his
name
or
relinquish
him
to
some
one
else
in
that
case
she
wondered
to
whom
she
would
like
to
turn
him
over
there
was
her
schoolmate
and
chum
miss
hamlin
how
lucky
any
man
would
be
to
get
her
and
harry
how
would
he
feel
about
it
then
like
a
cold
draught
in
her
brain
came
the
recollection
that
lucille
and
harry
had
corresponded
all
the
four
years
he
was
at
college
could
it
be
that
she
pauline
had
been
too
willful
and
headstrong
with
harry
if
so
was
it
possible
that
the
keen
edge
of
his
adoration
was
wearing
dull
pauline
had
just
succeeded
in
stamping
these
unpleasant
questions
deep
down
into
the
subconscious
parts
of
her
mind
when
the
young
man
whisked
up
in
the
runabout
pauline
wrath
melted
rapidly
harry
drove
as
he
did
everything
out
in
the
open
air
magnificently
his
judgment
of
distances
and
openings
was
precise
and
his
skill
in
weaving
his
way
through
heavy
traffic
was
startling
a
good
looking
young
man
is
seldom
seen
to
better
advantage
especially
by
a
girl
than
when
driving
a
powerful
car
pauline
loved
to
drive
with
harry
besides
his
spectacular
tricks
he
had
a
guileless
manner
of
getting
the
better
of
arguments
with
crossing
policemen
harry
was
not
driving
as
fast
as
usual
this
fact
was
impressed
on
her
by
shouts
and
waving
of
hands
from
a
car
which
passed
them
from
behind
that
lucille
cried
pauline
waving
yes
and
confound
it
that
billy
madison
taking
her
to
the
races
well
why
should
he
asked
pauline
is
it
all
right
yes
but
it
seems
to
me
he
is
paying
deal
of
attention
to
lucille
and
say
polly
you
do
suppose
she
be
silly
enough
to
care
for
him
do
you
that
sensation
of
a
cold
wave
in
the
back
of
her
brain
came
again
i
sure
i
do
know
she
replied
a
little
coldly
why
does
it
matter
very
much
to
you
harry
hesitated
even
stammered
a
little
in
denying
that
it
did
he
stammered
as
pauline
well
understood
because
he
was
not
telling
her
his
true
thoughts
it
did
matter
and
she
knew
it
in
reality
it
mattered
because
harry
knew
too
much
about
young
madison
to
want
him
to
win
the
affection
of
any
friend
of
his
but
harry
did
not
wish
to
explain
so
harry
does
care
for
lucille
and
always
has
cared
thought
pauline
the
sense
of
possession
of
the
youth
beside
her
faded
and
he
seemed
far
away
if
a
man
fears
he
is
losing
his
grip
on
a
girl
he
redoubles
his
attentions
and
racks
his
brains
to
be
more
interesting
and
attractive
to
her
a
girl
in
the
same
situation
reverses
the
tactics
just
as
harry
felt
the
absolute
zero
which
scientists
talk
about
settling
upon
him
he
remembered
a
very
important
duty
seems
to
me
we
do
drift
the
way
we
ought
to
said
harry
pressing
on
his
clutch
pedal
and
trying
to
took
concerned
i
think
we
have
been
a
long
time
getting
to
the
aviation
field
was
pauline
chilly
answer
harry
stopped
the
car
went
back
and
pulled
out
the
little
wooden
plug
in
the
gasoline
tank
then
away
they
went
again
leaving
a
little
wet
line
in
the
dust
of
the
road
pauline
stared
straight
ahead
attempts
at
conversation
fell
on
the
stony
ground
of
silence
or
at
best
brought
forth
only
the
briefest
and
most
colorless
answers
soon
harry
practiced
ear
caught
the
preliminary
warning
of
waning
gasoline
and
a
moment
later
half
way
up
a
gentle
hill
with
a
sob
from
all
its
six
cylinders
the
car
gave
up
the
ghost
a
few
miles
ahead
owen
also
was
in
difficulties
he
had
been
sailing
along
merrily
until
he
stopped
at
a
little
roadhouse
for
a
drink
the
machine
had
been
all
right
when
he
got
off
and
he
knew
nobody
had
touched
it
yet
now
it
acted
as
if
possessed
by
the
evil
one
with
great
difficulty
he
was
able
to
start
it
and
once
started
it
coughed
bucked
and
showed
all
the
symptoms
of
bronchitis
and
pneumonia
by
dint
of
strenuous
pedaling
owen
helped
the
asthmatic
motor
to
the
top
of
the
next
hill
it
ran
as
smoothly
as
a
watch
all
the
way
down
the
other
side
and
then
imitated
a
bunch
of
cannon
crackers
on
the
following
rise
owen
was
a
good
motorcycle
rider
but
a
very
poor
mechanic
his
machine
had
been
adjusted
cleaned
and
kept
in
repair
by
the
marvin
chauffeur
and
the
secretary
had
seldom
cause
to
investigate
it
on
the
road
he
had
always
used
the
carefully
filtered
gasoline
from
the
garage
so
that
he
neither
understood
the
present
alarming
symptoms
nor
knew
their
simple
cure
his
motor
was
protesting
at
a
drop
of
water
which
had
entered
the
needle
valve
of
his
carburetor
and
being
heavier
than
gasoline
had
lodged
there
and
stopped
its
flow
it
would
have
been
an
easy
matter
to
drain
the
carburetor
but
instead
owen
with
nervous
fingers
adjusted
everything
he
could
get
his
hands
on
and
after
two
hours
work
trundled
it
into
a
farmhouse
and
hired
the
farmer
to
drive
him
the
short
remaining
distance
to
the
aviation
field
several
machines
were
in
the
air
but
not
the
frenchman
when
the
farmer
drove
up
the
roads
and
the
edges
of
the
field
were
alive
with
cars
and
spectators
as
the
secretary
hastened
to
the
hangars
the
french
aviator
welcomed
owen
and
inquired
for
the
mademoiselle
this
confirmed
owen
fears
that
something
had
happened
to
her
on
the
way
it
had
troubled
him
a
little
that
the
runabout
had
not
passed
him
on
the
road
but
harry
might
have
made
a
detour
to
avoid
some
section
of
bad
road
owen
lost
another
hour
in
watching
and
worrying
before
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
the
rescue
there
were
plenty
of
idle
cars
but
it
was
not
easy
to
hire
one
as
they
were
mostly
guarded
by
chauffeurs
with
no
right
to
rent
or
lend
them
at
last
a
man
was
found
who
was
willing
to
pick
up
and
take
a
chance
that
his
master
would
not
know
about
it
the
rescue
car
found
them
just
where
they
had
stopped
half
way
up
the
hill
pauline
had
run
the
scale
of
feminine
annoyance
from
silence
to
sarcasm
to
tears
the
tears
produced
almost
the
same
effect
on
harry
determination
to
keep
pauline
from
flying
that
the
drops
of
water
had
in
owen
carburetor
the
spectacle
of
the
girl
he
loved
weeping
had
almost
broken
up
his
resolve
when
owen
dashed
by
shouted
turned
around
and
drew
up
alongside
harry
asked
for
help
and
the
chauffeur
who
had
never
had
the
pleasure
of
tinkering
with
a
marvin
six
was
inclined
to
dismount
and
aid
at
least
in
diagnosing
the
car
ailment
while
he
was
thinking
about
it
and
surveying
the
parts
which
harry
had
taken
out
and
strewn
about
the
running
board
in
his
pretended
trouble
hunt
pauline
had
dashed
away
her
tears
and
transferred
her
pretty
self
to
the
new
car
pauline
and
owen
both
knew
there
was
barely
time
to
reach
the
field
before
the
frenchman
ascent
so
with
scanty
farewells
harry
was
left
to
reassemble
his
car
when
he
had
set
up
the
last
nut
he
replaced
the
little
plug
in
the
tank
produced
a
can
of
gasoline
from
the
locker
behind
the
seats
emptied
it
into
his
tank
and
drove
at
reckless
speed
for
the
aviation
grounds
he
was
just
in
time
to
see
a
tiny
speck
on
the
edge
of
the
horizon
this
he
learned
was
the
frenchman
machine
he
was
told
that
it
carried
a
passenger
the
speck
grew
rapidly
in
size
developed
the
insect
shape
of
a
biplane
and
soon
seemed
to
be
over
the
other
end
of
the
aviation
field
the
young
man
joy
at
seeing
the
aeroplane
returning
in
safety
was
dampened
by
a
little
feeling
of
shame
that
by
such
devious
means
he
had
almost
spoiled
pauline
pleasure
i
act
like
an
old
woman
worrying
polly
this
way
he
decided
no
wonder
she
is
cross
to
me
lately
she
must
think
i
would
be
a
tyrant
of
a
harry
last
words
were
choked
by
a
spasm
of
the
throat
there
were
shouts
and
gestures
from
the
spectators
a
light
gust
of
wind
had
struck
the
aeroplane
on
the
right
wing
it
wavered
an
instant
like
a
dragon
fly
about
to
alight
and
then
instead
of
responding
to
the
aviator
levers
turned
on
its
left
side
and
plunged
to
the
ground
a
cloud
of
dust
arose
half
hiding
the
wreck
and
then
the
crash
of
impact
came
to
his
ears
there
was
a
second
of
silence
broken
by
a
groan
harry
heard
the
groan
and
did
even
know
it
came
from
his
own
throat
he
was
in
motion
now
forcing
people
to
the
right
and
left
and
running
down
the
field
it
seemed
miles
to
the
other
end
and
he
was
gratefully
conscious
that
others
nearer
were
hurrying
to
the
rescue
if
rescue
it
might
be
called
the
aeroplane
had
dropped
like
a
stone
from
a
height
that
forbade
hope
of
escape
would
she
be
conscious
and
would
he
be
in
time
to
give
and
receive
a
last
message
of
love
before
her
splendid
young
life
was
quenched
in
the
black
blot
of
death
besides
grief
there
was
fury
in
the
runner
heart
wrath
against
owen
for
encouraging
this
foolish
and
dangerous
caprice
against
the
unfortunate
driver
who
had
failed
to
preserve
his
precious
freight
and
against
nature
who
condemns
every
living
thing
by
one
means
or
another
to
that
same
final
failure
and
wreck
death
gasping
for
breath
from
his
exertions
he
was
at
last
within
a
hundred
feet
of
the
ruin
and
saw
people
lifting
up
the
engine
and
removing
a
limp
figure
just
then
two
people
stepped
in
his
way
he
did
not
turn
out
but
rushed
straight
at
them
rather
glad
to
have
something
to
burl
aside
in
his
blind
anger
nor
did
he
notice
that
one
was
a
woman
harry
plunge
carried
him
between
them
and
knocked
both
down
just
as
he
had
often
bowled
over
the
interference
in
his
football
games
on
he
lurched
wondering
vaguely
at
hearing
his
name
called
he
heard
it
again
and
it
sounded
like
pauline
voice
he
turned
and
it
was
pauline
after
all
pauline
had
arrived
too
late
had
missed
that
fatal
adventure
owen
watched
harry
lift
pauline
up
and
wrap
her
in
his
arms
with
a
squeeze
that
hurt
but
it
was
a
hurt
she
loved
and
though
she
sobbed
as
if
her
heart
would
break
they
were
sobs
of
relief
and
happiness
owen
watched
a
moment
and
then
slunk
away
his
schemes
had
been
for
nothing
pauline
was
alive
and
happy
in
her
lover
arms
and
the
secretary
was
no
nearer
his
goal
of
permanent
control
of
her
estate
than
before
he
walked
to
the
entrance
of
the
tent
and
tried
to
learn
from
the
nurses
and
doctors
who
were
hurrying
in
and
out
whether
the
french
aviator
would
live
or
die
nobody
would
stop
to
give
him
a
satisfactory
answer
there
was
a
flap
in
the
back
of
the
tent
and
through
this
owen
cautiously
peered
he
saw
a
nurse
with
something
that
looked
like
wet
absorbent
cotton
dabbing
at
a
round
black
object
presently
he
saw
that
the
round
object
was
the
head
of
a
man
blackened
by
fire
just
then
the
nurse
looked
up
saw
owen
guilty
face
and
gave
a
little
exclamation
of
dismay
at
the
same
instant
owen
felt
a
hand
grasp
his
elbow
withdrawing
his
head
from
the
tent
he
turned
quickly
and
was
confronted
by
the
red
face
of
hicks
the
blackmailer
counselor
and
dream
messenger
the
secretary
backed
away
from
hicks
with
a
face
of
terror
do
be
scared
said
hicks
in
a
hoarse
whisper
i
feel
as
if
i
were
in
this
thing
as
deep
as
you
are
in
what
thing
asked
owen
do
bluff
old
man
said
hicks
did
you
dream
about
me
last
night
well
what
have
my
dreams
to
do
with
you
stop
bluffing
replied
hicks
did
you
see
me
in
a
dream
last
night
and
did
i
leave
a
black
shining
stone
on
the
table
when
i
left
owen
did
not
deny
these
questions
and
the
man
went
on
i
see
you
took
my
advice
that
is
his
advice
whoever
he
is
and
you
fixed
the
wire
look
here
hicks
in
heaven
name
tell
me
what
this
means
i
did
dream
about
you
you
told
me
to
do
the
thing
and
it
your
fault
you
admit
you
are
in
it
now
what
is
it
owen
said
hicks
you
and
i
are
a
couple
of
pikers
in
a
big
game
bigger
than
we
understand
we
hold
the
cards
but
somebody
else
is
playing
the
hand
for
us
he
is
an
old
guy
and
a
wise
one
four
thousand
years
old
he
tells
me
and
though
it
scares
me
out
of
my
boots
to
think
who
i
am
trailing
along
with
i
going
to
stick
and
you
better
stick
too
and
let
him
play
our
hand
to
the
end
who
is
it
asked
owen
wondering
if
the
morphine
had
gotten
the
better
of
him
again
or
if
hicks
were
playing
some
uncanny
deceit
on
him
i
do
know
replied
hicks
he
somebody
who
has
been
dead
years
and
he
wants
to
have
this
girl
pauline
killed
so
he
can
get
her
back
i
suppose
he
some
kind
of
ghostly
white
slaver
it
is
our
business
what
he
is
as
long
as
he
takes
care
of
us
if
we
help
him
he
help
us
well
he
did
manage
very
well
today
objected
owen
he
planned
all
right
rejoined
hicks
the
machine
fell
and
if
she
been
in
it
she
have
been
killed
but
the
other
side
played
a
card
i
do
know
what
the
card
was
but
it
took
the
trick
and
she
did
go
up
in
the
machine
that
all
but
do
worry
we
have
better
luck
some
other
time
owen
shook
his
head
he
could
make
nothing
of
this
battle
of
unseen
forces
it
was
clear
to
him
that
he
had
grasped
at
the
one
big
chance
to
get
pauline
estate
and
had
missed
it
he
told
hicks
so
frankly
that
where
you
wrong
again
insisted
hicks
if
that
girl
had
been
killed
today
it
would
have
been
a
big
blunder
a
blunder
queried
owen
did
you
say
that
pauline
must
be
put
out
of
the
way
before
we
can
get
hold
of
her
fortune
listen
said
hicks
glancing
cautiously
about
come
over
here
away
from
these
people
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
that
it
would
have
been
a
big
blunder
if
pauline
had
been
killed
in
that
flying
machine
demanded
owen
yes
an
almighty
big
blunder
that
what
i
said
and
i
can
tell
you
why
we
were
pretty
stupid
not
to
think
of
it
before
now
what
got
to
happen
to
miss
pauline
hicks
placed
his
mouth
close
to
owen
car
and
whispered
chapter
v
the
pirate
and
pauline
a
sort
of
false
quiet
like
the
calm
that
broods
between
storms
kept
all
serene
at
the
marvin
mansion
for
a
week
after
the
aeroplane
catastrophe
little
had
been
seen
of
harry
who
was
busy
with
directors
meetings
and
visits
to
the
factories
owen
had
read
with
alarm
of
rumors
that
some
one
had
tampered
with
a
wire
of
the
wrecked
biplane
but
if
the
authorities
were
investigating
he
saw
no
signs
of
it
and
suspicion
pointed
no
finger
at
him
what
puzzled
and
worried
owen
more
than
anything
else
was
his
own
mind
and
behavior
having
no
belief
in
the
supernatural
he
could
not
account
for
the
dream
which
had
thrown
him
into
a
criminal
partnership
with
hicks
hicks
had
blackmailed
him
in
the
past
and
there
was
nobody
he
had
feared
and
hated
more
than
this
vulgar
and
disreputable
race
track
man
yet
hicks
had
appeared
to
him
in
a
dream
and
owen
had
promptly
done
his
bidding
involving
himself
in
what
would
probably
turn
out
to
be
murder
the
newspapers
reported
the
french
aviator
as
barely
living
from
day
to
day
owen
suffered
the
torment
of
a
lost
soul
but
at
least
he
had
no
more
dreams
or
spectral
visitations
hicks
called
him
on
the
telephone
once
or
twice
but
the
secretary
refused
to
talk
pauline
too
had
a
busy
week
besides
her
usual
social
activities
she
rewrote
and
finished
her
new
story
it
seemed
to
her
even
better
than
the
one
in
the
cosmopolitan
magazine
this
will
surely
be
taken
pauline
thought
with
a
little
sigh
of
regret
and
that
means
the
end
of
my
year
of
adventures
she
had
determined
on
this
course
the
night
after
the
accident
it
was
after
midnight
and
pauline
was
trying
to
marshal
the
exciting
recollections
of
the
day
into
the
orderly
mental
procession
that
leads
to
sleep
very
faintly
she
heard
what
sounded
like
the
music
of
a
distant
mandolin
pauline
knew
it
was
harry
went
to
the
open
window
and
looked
down
on
the
dark
lawn
there
he
was
playing
with
a
bit
of
straw
instead
of
a
pick
that
his
music
might
not
disturb
the
sleepers
in
the
house
pauline
wanted
to
throw
her
arms
around
him
and
promise
not
to
cause
any
more
worry
but
she
did
because
she
could
reach
him
from
the
window
after
harry
had
gone
pauline
decided
to
finish
her
story
send
it
to
a
publisher
and
let
his
decision
be
hers
if
they
accept
it
you
stay
home
and
marry
harry
she
told
the
pretty
face
under
the
filmy
night
cap
which
smiled
at
her
from
the
mirror
but
if
they
dare
reject
it
harry
will
have
to
worry
dear
boy
though
he
is
so
pauline
lost
no
time
in
finishing
and
submitting
her
manuscript
inclosing
a
special
delivery
stamp
and
a
request
please
to
let
her
know
at
once
on
saturday
pauline
received
a
bulky
letter
in
the
morning
mail
it
was
her
neatly
typed
manuscript
and
a
short
letter
declining
her
story
the
editor
thought
it
charming
showed
wonderful
imagination
gave
great
promise
of
future
success
but
there
was
a
lack
of
experience
evident
throughout
a
little
unreal
he
added
he
ventured
to
suggest
that
the
author
would
do
well
to
travel
around
and
see
the
world
from
different
angles
during
the
afternoon
harvey
schieffelin
dropped
in
for
a
call
he
had
found
her
story
in
the
cosmopolitan
and
complimented
her
then
he
began
to
laugh
polly
that
a
bully
story
of
yours
but
you
ought
to
have
gone
down
and
watched
some
stokers
do
work
before
you
described
that
scene
what
was
wrong
in
my
description
demanded
the
young
authoress
well
you
told
of
a
stoker
laying
his
grimy
hand
on
the
fire
door
and
pulling
it
open
to
rake
the
fire
well
could
he
do
that
oh
yes
laughed
harvey
he
could
but
he
would
do
it
more
than
once
those
doors
are
almost
red
hot
and
would
bum
the
flesh
off
the
stoker
hand
whether
it
were
grimy
or
not
i
show
you
on
my
yacht
some
time
what
you
need
is
harvey
do
you
dare
tell
me
i
need
experience
interrupted
pauline
with
unexpected
heat
young
schieffelin
saw
that
tears
were
almost
in
her
eyes
well
thought
schieffelin
this
vein
leads
too
close
to
water
and
he
hurried
to
shift
the
course
of
the
conversation
but
the
damage
was
done
pauline
took
her
story
to
the
little
open
fireplace
in
her
room
and
destroyed
it
at
the
same
time
she
destroyed
her
resolution
to
give
up
the
year
of
adventure
there
could
be
no
question
she
needed
experience
her
adopted
father
had
admitted
it
the
editor
had
said
it
and
even
an
young
man
like
schieffelin
could
see
it
she
was
sorry
for
harry
but
it
could
be
helped
she
picked
up
a
copy
of
treasure
island
and
soon
wished
fervently
that
the
days
of
pirates
were
back
again
owen
gave
up
his
fight
against
morphine
late
friday
night
saturday
he
was
at
peace
with
the
world
gone
were
all
the
nerve
clamorings
and
with
them
went
his
scruples
all
day
he
kept
a
furtive
watch
upon
pauline
and
even
heard
her
envious
remarks
about
pirates
to
harry
when
he
returned
for
a
weekend
at
home
owen
sympathized
with
pauline
in
her
regret
that
pirates
were
extinct
a
pirate
would
have
been
very
useful
to
the
secretary
just
then
however
there
were
other
plenty
of
them
and
perhaps
some
other
kind
would
do
there
were
gunmen
for
instance
but
an
honest
district
attorney
had
lately
made
these
murderous
gentlemen
of
the
underworld
almost
as
quiet
as
pirates
he
was
still
pondering
when
hicks
called
again
on
the
telephone
this
time
the
secretary
responded
and
made
an
immediate
appointment
in
a
cafe
near
street
owen
related
the
events
of
the
week
ending
with
pauline
hankering
for
pirates
the
two
men
got
their
heads
together
and
rapidly
evolved
a
plan
from
the
cafe
they
took
a
taxi
and
rode
along
the
water
front
first
on
one
side
of
the
island
of
manhattan
and
then
on
the
other
the
cab
stopped
near
the
saloons
while
the
two
schemers
entered
and
looked
over
the
sailors
and
longshoremen
refreshing
themselves
at
the
bars
after
covering
several
miles
of
water
front
they
had
collected
as
many
as
a
dozen
abominable
barroom
cigars
and
a
few
equally
dubious
drinks
but
had
not
yet
found
what
they
were
looking
for
on
front
street
they
saw
a
man
and
both
cried
out
look
there
he
is
the
man
was
a
specimen
he
had
the
rolling
gait
of
the
deep
sea
a
squinting
eye
gave
him
a
villainous
leer
while
a
bristly
beard
and
long
gray
hair
made
him
a
ferocious
spectacle
his
age
was
doubtful
as
the
lines
in
his
ruddy
skin
might
have
been
cut
by
dissipation
as
much
as
age
the
most
prominent
feature
of
his
unlovely
countenance
was
a
nose
fiery
red
from
prolonged
exposure
to
sunburn
or
if
he
is
a
pirate
he
ought
to
be
one
said
owen
the
man
carried
the
top
of
a
ship
binnacle
as
the
round
brass
case
which
holds
a
ship
compass
is
called
he
entered
the
dismal
portal
of
a
marine
junk
shop
the
taxi
was
stopped
discreetly
a
block
away
as
owen
and
hicks
approached
the
shop
they
heard
a
loud
argument
going
on
inside
how
much
do
you
want
for
it
ten
dollars
it
a
negus
ten
nothing
you
stole
it
you
son
of
a
sea
cook
i
give
you
a
dime
for
it
i
did
not
steal
it
so
help
me
the
captain
of
that
juicer
over
in
the
north
river
gave
it
to
me
for
saving
his
little
gal
life
he
begged
me
to
take
anything
i
wanted
but
i
fancied
this
i
tell
you
about
it
then
owen
and
hicks
listening
just
outside
heard
a
fearful
and
wonderful
tale
to
relate
it
in
the
sailor
own
words
stripped
of
the
long
oaths
would
be
as
impossible
as
to
pick
the
green
specks
out
of
a
sage
cheese
in
brief
the
gentleman
with
the
binnacle
sauntering
innocently
along
the
docks
friday
night
had
heard
a
commotion
on
the
british
tramp
which
he
referred
to
as
a
lime
juicer
some
fifteen
or
more
had
invaded
the
ship
overcome
the
captain
tied
him
down
and
were
about
to
kidnap
his
daughter
the
teller
of
the
story
had
walked
in
and
thrashed
them
all
driven
them
off
into
the
darkness
rescued
the
little
girl
and
released
the
captain
in
gratitude
the
commander
had
made
him
a
present
of
the
binnacle
head
at
the
conclusion
of
the
story
there
was
a
pause
then
the
other
voice
answered
you
a
wonder
as
i
said
before
i
give
you
ten
cents
for
the
binnacle
and
ninety
cents
for
the
story
now
you
can
take
it
or
have
you
pinched
for
swiping
it
gim
me
the
dollar
said
the
hero
of
the
tale
and
a
moment
later
he
passed
down
the
street
with
the
two
eavesdroppers
at
his
heels
the
sailor
man
proceeding
at
a
rapid
pace
suddenly
turned
a
comer
like
a
yacht
jibing
around
a
buoy
and
plunged
into
a
dingy
saloon
owen
and
hicks
went
in
after
him
owen
ordered
and
invited
the
sailor
to
join
them
they
learned
that
his
name
was
nelson
cromwell
boyd
that
he
had
deserted
from
the
british
navy
at
a
tender
age
and
since
then
had
been
through
a
series
of
incredible
adventures
and
injustices
which
disproved
the
old
adage
that
you
ca
keep
a
good
man
down
at
last
owen
intimated
that
he
had
a
business
proposition
to
discuss
and
they
adjourned
to
the
sidewalk
do
you
want
to
earn
some
money
asked
hicks
well
that
depends
said
boyd
doubtfully
easy
money
suggested
owen
that
the
only
kind
worth
going
after
commented
the
sailor
that
where
we
agree
with
you
my
friend
said
hicks
we
are
after
easy
money
and
plenty
of
it
plenty
for
us
and
plenty
for
you
too
if
you
can
keep
quiet
about
it
that
the
kind
of
talk
i
like
to
hear
but
as
honest
man
to
honest
man
i
want
to
warn
you
that
there
must
be
too
much
work
to
it
i
do
believe
in
the
nobility
of
labor
i
believe
that
work
is
the
crowning
shame
and
humiliation
of
the
human
race
it
all
right
for
a
horse
or
a
dog
or
an
ox
to
work
but
a
man
ought
to
be
above
it
degrading
interferes
with
his
pleasures
and
wastes
his
time
i
feel
the
same
way
agreed
owen
but
somebody
has
got
to
work
to
make
shoes
and
food
for
us
yes
admitted
the
sailor
regretfully
there
will
always
have
to
be
some
work
done
and
i
sorry
for
the
poor
guys
that
must
do
it
but
there
been
too
much
work
done
those
sentiments
are
very
noble
said
owen
it
all
very
fine
to
worry
about
your
fellow
man
but
you
would
like
to
have
plenty
of
money
even
if
the
rest
of
the
world
is
fool
enough
to
keep
on
working
i
suppose
so
said
the
sailor
but
i
a
reformer
and
my
business
is
to
talk
not
work
that
just
what
we
want
you
to
do
said
owen
and
hicks
in
answer
then
they
found
a
table
in
the
rear
of
a
saloon
where
they
could
unfold
their
plan
boyd
was
to
be
introduced
to
a
foolish
young
girl
who
had
a
barrel
of
money
he
was
to
tell
her
a
yam
along
certain
lines
and
owen
and
hicks
would
take
care
of
the
rest
the
question
is
said
owen
whether
you
can
talk
and
act
like
a
sort
of
reformed
pirate
leave
that
to
me
he
assured
them
and
led
the
way
out
of
the
saloon
and
into
still
another
grimy
and
disreputable
place
it
was
axel
olofsen
pawnshop
and
general
supply
and
clothing
store
after
much
pawing
over
ancient
worn
and
rusty
weapons
boyd
was
at
last
fitted
out
ole
was
paid
about
sixty
per
cent
of
what
he
asked
and
left
to
the
enjoyment
of
his
scandinavian
melancholy
you
look
like
a
pirate
now
sure
enough
said
owen
observing
effect
on
the
driver
of
the
taxicab
i
look
it
but
i
do
quite
feel
it
yet
said
boyd
with
deep
meaning
there
is
something
lacking
what
can
it
be
asked
hicks
about
three
fingers
of
the
sailor
explained
pointing
to
a
saloon
that
will
make
my
disguise
just
perfect
in
the
saloon
hicks
and
owen
made
a
little
map
wrinkled
it
and
soiled
it
on
the
floor
then
gave
it
to
the
pirate
tell
her
said
owen
as
he
called
for
a
taxi
that
it
is
only
a
copy
of
your
original
which
is
all
worn
out
the
nearer
they
approached
to
the
house
the
more
talkative
became
the
pirate
he
demanded
to
know
more
details
of
what
was
to
be
done
and
finally
assumed
an
air
of
authority
you
say
that
rich
girl
is
crazy
to
see
something
worth
writin
about
now
i
know
something
better
than
pirates
and
buried
treasure
shouted
the
pirate
confidently
yes
no
doubt
owen
replied
soothingly
and
with
some
alarm
at
the
man
bravado
but
it
pirates
she
is
interested
in
just
now
never
mind
i
say
i
know
something
better
insisted
the
pirate
if
she
will
go
and
do
what
i
goin
ter
tell
yer
she
sure
see
something
like
she
never
dreamed
of
now
listen
to
me
sharp
it
was
an
extraordinary
proposition
the
pirate
made
owen
laughed
a
gentle
discouragement
and
shook
his
head
but
hicks
fixed
his
eyes
keenly
on
the
man
and
was
evidently
turning
the
suggestion
over
in
his
mind
owen
key
admitted
the
three
to
the
front
hall
without
ringing
but
a
maid
happened
to
cross
the
hall
and
caught
sight
of
boyd
with
a
scream
and
a
flutter
she
retreated
owen
seated
his
two
confederates
in
the
hall
and
went
in
search
of
pauline
owen
found
pauline
alone
in
the
library
never
did
a
villain
propose
a
scheme
to
a
beautiful
girl
at
a
more
favorable
moment
half
the
afternoon
and
a
little
while
after
dinner
she
had
been
absorbing
treasure
island
and
now
came
owen
asking
her
if
she
would
like
to
meet
a
reformed
pirate
and
go
on
a
thrilling
and
adventurous
expedition
owen
you
are
a
perfect
angel
bring
in
your
pirate
i
sorry
though
that
he
has
reformed
pauline
shook
hands
with
hicks
but
hardly
noticed
him
she
had
eyes
only
for
the
pirate
who
impressed
her
mightily
with
awe
and
admiration
she
saw
his
scowling
and
squinting
eye
run
over
her
and
then
travel
about
the
room
pauline
approved
of
the
pirate
but
the
pirate
did
not
approve
of
pauline
and
he
almost
told
her
so
but
he
met
the
warning
eyes
of
his
confederates
and
restrained
himself
he
had
his
story
to
tell
and
he
would
do
it
after
all
that
was
the
best
way
to
attack
this
girl
and
her
fortune
tell
us
about
the
treasure
said
pauline
eagerly
hush
he
shouted
in
a
voice
that
made
the
girl
jump
i
tell
you
but
by
the
blood
of
morgan
if
one
of
you
ever
tells
a
living
soul
i
cut
his
liver
out
said
the
pirate
pauline
gasped
and
the
secretary
told
him
that
it
was
considered
good
manners
to
point
with
a
sharp
knife
but
they
all
swore
to
secrecy
and
the
pirate
proceeded
i
was
but
a
slip
of
a
lad
when
i
ran
away
and
sailed
from
liverpool
in
the
good
brig
nancy
lee
with
as
villainous
a
crew
as
i
ever
seen
where
we
was
bound
for
and
why
is
none
of
your
business
them
that
planned
that
voyage
has
cashed
in
their
souls
to
their
maker
and
ah
well
as
i
was
saying
they
was
a
villainous
crew
low
and
vile
and
i
was
the
cabin
boy
and
slept
on
the
transoms
in
the
captain
cabin
the
weather
was
awful
and
the
grub
was
worse
but
all
went
well
till
we
reached
the
roarin
forties
the
skipper
knew
how
to
handle
sailors
you
bet
he
did
when
they
came
aft
to
kick
about
the
grub
he
knocked
down
before
they
said
two
words
pauline
gave
a
little
exclamation
of
dismay
at
this
point
and
the
pirate
turned
to
her
in
explanation
you
see
knockin
down
quick
like
that
avoids
a
lot
of
cross
words
and
unpleasant
arguments
such
as
makes
hard
feelin
on
long
voyages
yes
as
i
was
saying
all
went
well
until
the
second
mate
got
to
knockin
out
with
his
left
hand
which
the
same
was
all
right
too
but
he
was
heard
to
pass
a
remark
one
day
that
he
only
hit
landlubbers
with
his
left
hand
the
crew
they
was
insulted
and
that
very
night
the
second
mate
went
overboard
who
done
it
nobody
knows
leastways
the
captain
find
out
it
made
the
old
man
peevish
like
and
he
got
to
arguin
with
them
sailors
instead
of
wallopin
the
way
he
oughter
done
and
one
day
they
turned
on
him
it
was
all
over
in
a
minute
they
had
the
old
man
thrown
and
tied
the
first
mate
came
firin
his
pistols
but
they
downed
him
too
i
took
the
wheel
while
they
decided
what
to
do
mike
their
leader
had
about
persuaded
the
men
to
send
the
captain
and
mate
to
davy
jones
locker
and
the
carpenter
was
riggin
the
plank
for
to
walk
when
i
up
and
puts
in
a
word
i
pleaded
for
their
lives
and
though
mike
was
dead
agin
the
idea
they
voted
to
let
them
live
the
last
we
saw
of
they
was
off
in
the
jolly
boat
with
a
jug
of
water
and
a
loaf
of
bread
the
mariner
paused
and
pauline
suggested
delightedly
and
as
soon
as
they
had
cooled
down
they
were
grateful
to
you
and
made
you
their
leader
they
did
not
answered
the
pirate
they
broached
a
cask
of
rum
in
the
forward
hold
and
i
overheard
plotting
to
throw
me
to
the
sharks
how
awful
said
pauline
yes
miss
agreed
the
pirate
it
was
awkward
and
embarrassing
like
for
a
mere
slip
of
a
lad
so
i
up
and
goes
into
the
captain
cabin
and
gets
all
the
pistols
and
knives
and
cutlasses
there
was
and
brings
out
on
deck
pretty
soon
them
drunken
devils
come
out
of
the
fore
hatch
picks
up
half
a
dozen
capstan
bars
and
some
belyin
pins
and
a
marlin
spike
or
two
and
runs
aft
and
yellin
i
gives
one
warnin
and
then
fires
the
pirate
stopped
coughed
and
looked
around
oh
please
go
on
begged
pauline
yes
miss
replied
the
sailor
but
this
talking
affects
my
throat
could
you
possibly
why
certainly
interrupted
owen
i
get
you
a
drink
after
the
sailor
had
swallowed
the
biggest
drink
ever
poured
out
in
that
house
he
continued
yes
that
was
as
neat
a
fight
as
i
ever
was
in
there
was
some
twenty
of
all
told
and
what
happened
then
demanded
pauline
well
miss
it
come
on
to
blow
and
there
was
the
old
ship
along
under
full
sail
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
the
old
hulk
from
foundering
at
that
but
i
stuck
to
the
wheel
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
to
keep
from
freezin
i
had
to
drink
a
lot
of
grog
oh
a
powerful
lot
of
grog
so
much
grog
that
i
been
dependent
on
it
ever
since
and
i
take
a
little
now
if
it
agreeable
it
was
exactly
agreeable
but
he
got
it
and
continued
finally
we
fetched
up
on
the
rocks
of
a
desert
island
all
the
boats
had
been
smashed
and
carried
away
by
the
storm
so
i
had
to
build
a
raft
the
first
two
loads
was
all
provisions
and
then
i
took
the
treasure
ashore
what
treasure
asked
pauline
oh
bless
your
heart
did
i
tell
you
about
the
treasure
no
said
hicks
with
a
scowl
and
that
the
part
we
want
to
hear
about
oh
money
ai
everything
rebuked
the
pirate
in
a
lordly
manner
there
was
a
matter
of
a
million
dollars
or
so
in
good
british
gold
and
what
it
was
on
the
lee
for
is
nobody
business
i
took
it
all
ashore
an
buried
it
on
the
island
here
a
copy
of
the
chart
i
made
and
you
three
is
the
first
to
lay
human
eyes
on
it
while
pauline
examined
reverently
the
dingy
bit
of
paper
the
pirate
concluded
his
yarn
after
i
buried
the
last
f
it
i
rigged
a
mast
on
the
raft
and
fetched
up
on
one
of
the
bahamas
and
you
have
never
been
back
to
get
the
gold
queried
pauline
no
miss
though
i
started
many
the
time
but
a
poor
man
like
me
finds
it
hard
to
fit
out
a
proper
expedition
if
you
fancy
the
notion
and
want
to
go
along
with
me
and
pay
all
the
expenses
divvy
up
half
and
half
with
you
what
do
you
say
pauline
looked
at
owen
and
hicks
who
nodded
approvingly
she
had
no
great
faith
in
finding
any
gold
old
marvin
had
said
that
treasure
bunts
rarely
produce
any
results
but
he
had
also
remarked
that
they
were
very
thrilling
and
here
surely
was
adventure
well
worth
a
little
time
and
money
pauline
agreed
and
the
pirate
was
in
the
midst
of
imposing
a
oath
of
secrecy
when
harry
demanded
admittance
nobody
least
of
all
the
sailor
would
tell
him
what
was
in
the
wind
except
that
they
were
going
off
on
a
trip
of
adventure
the
young
man
disapproved
of
both
hicks
and
the
pirate
and
the
latter
showed
his
dislike
of
harry
it
was
with
regret
that
the
man
of
the
sea
recollected
owen
stipulation
that
harry
must
on
no
account
be
allowed
to
go
with
the
party
nothing
would
have
pleased
the
pirate
better
than
to
have
got
these
two
happy
and
innocent
representatives
of
gains
alone
with
him
on
the
high
seas
pauline
too
wished
to
have
harry
who
was
frowning
and
suspiciously
demanding
information
but
she
had
sworn
the
oath
of
a
buccaneer
and
far
be
it
from
her
to
break
faith
with
the
confiding
freebooter
so
once
more
harry
was
kept
out
of
pauline
councils
he
was
a
little
provoked
at
her
this
time
for
her
willfulness
seemed
almost
perverse
after
the
lesson
she
should
have
learned
from
the
aeroplane
wreck
chapter
vi
the
treasure
hunters
excitement
and
activity
pervaded
the
house
sunday
and
monday
every
one
including
harry
soon
knew
that
pauline
was
to
take
steamer
to
old
nassau
in
the
bahamas
harry
intended
to
quietly
board
the
steamer
a
little
earlier
than
pauline
and
surprise
the
party
by
appearing
after
the
ship
was
well
out
to
sea
his
plans
shattered
by
the
young
lady
unexpected
early
arrival
harry
with
a
suitcase
in
each
hand
met
her
face
to
face
on
the
pier
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
confess
kiss
her
goodbye
and
go
it
was
with
a
pang
of
regret
that
she
saw
him
toss
his
two
suitcases
covered
with
college
team
labels
into
a
taxicab
and
depart
an
hour
later
the
four
treasure
hunters
stood
looking
over
the
rail
watching
the
last
passengers
come
aboard
the
pirate
in
a
new
blue
suit
huge
panama
hat
and
light
pink
necktie
though
a
rather
unusual
sight
had
been
toned
down
in
appearance
to
a
degree
that
permitted
him
to
walk
about
among
people
without
causing
a
crowd
to
collect
hicks
too
at
owen
suggestion
had
adopted
quieter
attire
just
as
the
gangplank
was
about
to
be
pulled
in
the
deckhands
waited
to
permit
a
very
feeble
and
bent
old
man
to
hobble
aboard
he
had
long
white
hair
and
his
face
was
mostly
gray
whiskers
except
a
pair
of
dark
spectacles
a
porter
followed
him
bearing
two
brand
new
suitcases
the
adventurous
four
were
soon
comfortably
perched
in
steamer
chairs
watching
new
york
harbor
slip
by
them
they
had
barely
reached
the
statue
of
liberty
when
the
pirate
launched
forth
on
one
of
his
tales
of
the
sea
highly
colored
picturesque
untrue
and
absurd
as
a
stained
glass
window
nevertheless
these
yams
took
on
a
semblance
of
reality
from
the
character
of
the
narrator
himself
in
all
his
stories
the
pirate
was
the
hero
nobody
noticed
that
a
steward
had
placed
a
fifth
steamer
chair
beside
the
sailor
until
that
worthy
reached
one
of
the
main
climaxes
of
his
narrative
at
that
point
he
felt
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
looked
around
into
the
whiskers
and
black
spectacles
of
the
old
passenger
the
cackling
voice
remarked
it
a
lie
it
a
lie
it
a
lie
every
one
was
astonished
but
even
the
pirate
had
a
trace
of
respect
for
such
great
age
and
said
nothing
in
reply
after
a
while
he
continued
only
to
be
interrupted
by
the
same
words
this
was
too
much
to
endure
and
though
the
if
pirate
held
his
tongue
they
rebuked
the
old
dotard
by
walking
away
and
leaning
over
the
rail
the
conversation
wandered
to
the
subject
of
sharks
and
pauline
asked
if
they
were
as
stupid
as
they
looked
do
you
believe
it
the
pirate
assured
her
them
sharks
look
stupid
just
to
fool
you
why
i
remember
a
time
not
so
long
ago
down
in
choco
bay
on
the
coast
of
colombia
there
was
an
old
devil
who
used
to
sneak
up
alongside
sailin
vessels
in
a
fog
he
carried
in
his
mouth
the
big
iron
shank
of
an
anchor
he
picked
up
from
the
wreck
what
did
he
do
that
for
asked
hicks
so
the
iron
would
deflect
the
compass
and
make
them
run
the
ship
onto
the
kelp
ledges
off
the
pinudas
islands
if
a
ship
went
down
he
stood
a
good
chance
of
eating
one
or
two
o
the
passengers
but
i
do
mind
sharks
if
you
want
to
know
what
really
annoys
me
them
killer
whales
in
the
antarctic
that
come
a
crowdin
and
buttin
up
against
ye
it
an
internal
monumental
lie
cackled
a
voice
behind
him
every
one
looked
and
there
was
the
old
man
the
pirate
was
now
thoroughly
exasperated
if
he
could
tell
a
story
without
being
interrupted
in
this
manner
life
was
worth
living
he
announced
that
he
would
find
the
old
man
and
thrash
him
owen
and
hicks
were
annoyed
but
they
feared
the
result
of
the
fury
they
might
all
be
arrested
on
arriving
at
nassau
this
would
interfere
with
plans
and
must
not
be
thought
of
to
appease
the
wrathful
pirate
owen
offered
to
have
the
old
man
thrashed
so
soundly
that
he
would
probably
be
glad
to
stay
out
of
sight
the
rest
of
the
voyage
there
were
some
rascally
looking
men
of
spanish
blood
among
the
second
cabin
passengers
who
as
owen
and
hicks
observed
looked
needy
and
unscrupulous
the
secretary
found
no
great
embarrassment
in
explaining
that
he
wished
the
old
man
thrashed
quietly
and
privately
the
spaniards
agreed
to
beat
him
thoroughly
for
the
trifling
consideration
of
ten
dollars
they
would
even
throw
him
overboard
for
a
very
reasonable
sum
additional
but
the
bargain
was
struck
at
ten
dollars
for
a
moderate
beating
and
the
foreigners
were
warned
that
as
he
was
delicate
they
must
be
careful
not
to
kill
him
during
the
next
hour
or
two
the
old
man
passed
the
four
treasure
hunters
in
their
steamer
chairs
but
each
time
the
pirate
ceased
talking
before
he
came
within
earshot
at
last
the
old
man
stopped
in
front
of
pauline
and
gazed
long
at
the
pirate
he
studied
the
rascal
face
apparently
trying
to
remember
the
identity
of
the
man
slowly
the
aged
head
nodded
as
if
he
was
saying
to
himself
yes
he
is
the
same
man
then
turning
to
pauline
and
shaking
a
warning
finger
the
old
man
delivered
a
surprising
message
pauline
was
startled
the
three
men
leaped
to
their
feet
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
she
was
able
to
prevent
owen
excused
himself
to
hunt
up
his
spaniards
and
demand
an
explanation
for
their
slowness
to
his
surprise
they
declared
that
they
had
tackled
him
and
that
he
was
as
quick
and
powerful
as
a
gorilla
he
had
thrashed
them
both
and
they
were
glad
to
escape
with
their
lives
the
was
incredulous
but
they
showed
cuts
and
bruises
and
demanded
their
money
saying
that
a
joke
had
been
played
on
them
when
owen
refused
one
of
them
drew
a
stiletto
and
the
ten
dollars
was
forthcoming
returning
ruefully
he
related
the
failure
of
the
spaniards
the
pirate
at
once
said
now
let
me
handle
him
a
few
moments
later
boyd
cornered
his
ancient
adversary
on
a
deserted
and
piece
of
deck
old
man
snarled
the
pirate
you
say
all
my
stories
are
lies
only
your
gray
hairs
have
saved
you
from
a
thrashing
before
this
if
it
my
gray
hairs
that
stop
you
i
remove
that
obstacle
the
pirate
was
amazed
to
see
the
aged
person
take
off
his
hat
and
remove
a
gray
wig
with
his
left
hand
while
his
right
fist
collided
with
the
pirate
eye
when
consciousness
returned
he
was
lying
on
the
deck
with
no
living
thing
in
sight
but
a
seagull
aeroplaning
on
slanted
wings
over
his
head
his
return
to
the
party
was
more
rueful
than
owen
what
is
the
matter
with
your
eye
mr
boyd
asked
pauline
innocently
why
you
see
said
the
pirate
i
was
looking
at
a
girl
with
one
of
these
new
slit
skirts
and
i
stumbled
and
bumped
against
a
ventilator
i
see
commented
owen
to
help
him
out
you
sort
of
slipped
on
a
so
to
speak
yes
said
the
sailor
gratefully
it
was
just
like
that
it
a
lie
said
a
high
thin
voice
from
somewhere
and
they
noticed
that
a
porthole
behind
them
was
open
pauline
found
conversation
difficult
hicks
as
a
man
of
few
words
which
gave
him
an
undeserved
reputation
for
wisdom
the
pirate
had
given
up
spinning
yams
on
account
of
the
old
man
unfailing
interruption
owen
mind
too
was
preoccupied
with
a
growing
suspicion
so
the
adventurous
young
lady
went
to
her
stateroom
and
wrote
a
letter
to
harry
the
sailor
intimated
that
he
had
important
news
which
could
be
only
told
in
the
privacy
of
owen
stateroom
the
secretary
suspected
this
to
be
only
a
maneuver
on
the
pirate
part
to
get
acquainted
with
the
whiskey
he
knew
owen
kept
with
him
but
the
seafarer
unfolded
the
tale
of
his
black
eye
not
truthfully
nor
accurately
except
in
that
he
had
recognized
harry
under
the
disguise
of
the
old
man
i
more
than
half
suspected
it
said
owen
and
i
have
been
watching
his
stateroom
but
there
is
no
way
any
one
can
see
into
his
room
unless
by
getting
a
look
in
through
the
porthole
and
there
where
you
get
a
good
idea
said
the
pirate
but
there
no
good
having
a
peep
at
him
without
his
disguise
now
that
it
harry
objected
hicks
no
said
the
pirate
turning
on
owen
his
lusterless
eyes
faded
by
much
grog
to
a
dimness
that
reminded
one
of
the
faint
lights
set
in
ships
decks
and
known
as
no
but
your
porthole
idea
is
just
the
scheme
to
get
at
him
and
get
rid
of
him
i
can
slip
down
a
rope
tonight
when
all
is
quiet
and
the
fool
passengers
are
over
on
the
other
side
looking
at
the
bloody
moon
and
then
what
said
owen
i
goes
down
the
rope
and
shoots
the
old
fool
i
mean
the
young
fool
through
the
porthole
why
that
murder
cried
owen
we
all
swing
for
it
no
it
ai
murder
it
suicide
i
throw
the
gun
in
there
where
they
find
it
when
they
break
the
door
in
and
think
he
shot
himself
it
practical
commented
hicks
but
owen
protested
at
last
it
was
decided
that
a
fourth
man
was
necessary
to
do
the
shooting
and
the
pirate
volunteered
to
produce
him
there
an
old
shipmate
o
mine
down
in
the
stoke
hole
working
like
a
nigger
he
be
glad
to
do
the
trick
for
ten
dollars
but
we
make
it
fifty
because
the
poor
fellow
has
a
wife
and
children
and
needs
the
money
i
go
get
him
owen
and
hicks
went
on
deck
while
boyd
descended
to
the
fiery
vitals
of
the
steamer
it
is
not
an
easy
matter
to
smuggle
a
grimy
stoker
from
his
furnace
to
the
upper
passenger
decks
but
the
pirate
managed
it
meanwhile
harry
was
not
losing
time
he
had
taken
a
dictograph
from
his
baggage
borrowed
a
few
dry
batteries
and
a
coil
of
wire
from
the
wireless
operator
he
carefully
installed
the
instrument
in
his
stateroom
and
led
the
wires
out
under
his
door
to
the
passageway
from
there
it
was
an
easy
task
to
carry
them
along
the
edge
of
the
carpet
to
the
door
of
owen
stateroom
arrived
at
the
point
he
was
compelled
to
leave
pliers
wire
and
the
receiving
instrument
under
a
chair
like
many
another
stateroom
door
owen
could
not
be
locked
easily
from
the
outside
so
when
the
three
conspirators
went
out
they
left
it
unlocked
the
old
man
slipped
in
a
moment
later
and
quickly
placed
the
dictograph
under
the
lower
bunk
returning
to
his
own
room
the
old
man
took
up
his
instrument
and
listened
but
he
was
not
a
very
expert
electrician
and
the
dictograph
for
a
long
time
failed
to
give
anything
but
roars
and
crackling
sounds
though
he
was
convinced
there
were
several
persons
talking
a
last
he
got
the
thing
adjusted
in
time
to
catch
the
last
sentences
of
the
conversation
he
recognized
the
voice
of
the
pirate
it
said
an
then
we
lowers
you
down
the
rope
to
his
porthole
you
sticks
your
gun
in
and
shoot
the
old
fool
do
forget
to
throw
the
gun
in
afterward
so
they
think
he
killed
himself
see
sure
i
got
yer
matey
replied
a
strange
voice
after
this
the
dictograph
must
have
got
out
of
order
as
nothing
further
came
over
the
wire
after
closing
the
porthole
harry
started
to
take
off
his
disguise
with
a
view
of
revealing
himself
and
having
owen
hicks
and
the
pirate
arrested
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
not
heard
owen
or
hicks
talking
and
very
likely
they
were
not
in
the
room
at
all
it
was
probably
a
crazy
drunken
scheme
of
the
old
sailor
whom
he
had
tormented
neither
owen
nor
hicks
had
any
suspicion
so
far
as
he
knew
that
behind
the
whiskers
and
eyeglasses
was
harry
owen
could
have
no
object
in
shooting
him
can
it
be
that
i
am
jealous
of
this
man
owen
he
wondered
polly
has
been
taking
his
advice
against
mine
lately
what
can
that
mean
peace
reigned
during
the
evening
while
the
old
liner
plunged
and
rolled
past
wicked
cape
hatteras
while
the
passengers
listened
to
the
sad
orchestra
in
the
saloon
harry
still
in
his
whiskered
disguise
sent
a
wireless
to
a
lawyer
in
new
york
requesting
him
to
telegraph
pauline
at
nassau
something
that
would
make
her
come
home
then
he
went
back
to
his
stateroom
and
locked
the
door
as
he
stepped
in
he
caught
sight
of
the
unbeautiful
countenance
of
boyd
squinting
wickedly
at
him
from
far
down
the
passageway
just
for
that
evil
grin
of
yours
pirate
thought
harry
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
or
your
friend
shoot
me
until
after
daylight
so
harry
kept
his
porthole
closed
tight
that
night
sleeping
rather
restlessly
without
his
accustomed
ventilation
twice
he
heard
a
faint
scraping
sound
on
the
outside
of
his
cabin
and
a
dark
shadow
eclipsed
the
faint
nimbus
of
light
which
the
foggy
night
sent
through
his
porthole
on
the
deck
directly
over
his
head
three
dark
figures
sat
in
deck
chairs
while
a
fourth
paced
the
deck
his
cigar
glowing
like
the
tail
lamp
of
a
distant
automobile
the
fog
began
to
lift
just
before
dawn
and
the
stoker
making
another
trip
down
his
rope
found
the
porthole
open
a
hasty
inspection
of
the
decks
indicated
that
it
was
safe
to
go
ahead
owen
hicks
and
the
pirate
quickly
lowered
the
stoker
sitting
in
a
little
swing
known
on
the
sea
as
a
chair
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
pistol
which
hicks
had
provided
each
of
the
three
conspirators
had
revolvers
but
the
racetrack
man
weapon
was
chosen
because
he
had
obtained
it
from
a
source
to
which
it
could
not
be
traced
down
went
the
stoker
his
bare
feet
clinging
to
the
gently
swaying
side
of
the
ship
the
porthole
was
open
and
there
in
the
dim
interior
of
the
cabin
the
light
was
reflected
from
a
pair
of
spectacles
there
too
were
the
whiskers
and
gray
hair
the
old
man
seemed
to
be
asleep
in
his
chair
right
near
the
porthole
the
stoker
cocked
his
revolver
and
held
it
ready
for
instant
action
the
steamer
fog
horn
blew
a
blast
at
the
fast
thinning
fog
this
noise
was
just
what
the
stoker
wanted
he
quickly
plunged
his
pistol
into
the
porthole
and
fired
it
point
blank
in
the
very
face
of
the
old
man
there
could
be
no
question
of
missing
he
looked
up
at
the
three
eager
faces
and
nodded
that
all
was
well
i
got
him
he
called
out
and
was
about
to
hurl
the
pistol
into
the
stateroom
when
an
unpleasant
and
unexpected
thing
happened
a
brawny
fist
shot
out
of
the
porthole
and
collided
with
the
jaw
more
from
surprise
than
the
force
of
the
blow
the
stoker
fell
backward
into
the
sea
the
three
watchers
on
deck
saw
the
proceeding
and
only
one
the
pirate
had
presence
of
mind
to
hurl
a
lifebuoy
no
alarm
was
sounded
the
steamer
went
on
into
the
sparkling
morning
sea
leaving
behind
her
a
profane
and
disgusted
stoker
this
unfortunate
had
only
a
lifebuoy
to
aid
him
on
a
swim
to
shore
never
mind
said
the
pirate
after
the
conspirators
had
gotten
over
their
first
fright
at
the
dashing
of
their
plans
i
have
an
idea
it
a
corking
idea
and
you
all
like
it
what
is
it
asked
owen
nervously
here
is
your
drink
now
your
idea
but
the
pirate
would
tell
he
objected
that
it
was
too
startling
for
them
to
carry
in
their
timid
brains
he
would
unfold
it
when
the
time
came
and
he
promised
them
that
it
would
be
the
greatest
and
most
daring
project
they
had
ever
heard
a
murderous
glare
lit
up
the
faded
eyes
and
he
chuckled
to
himself
but
no
offers
nor
threats
would
induce
him
to
part
with
his
secret
chapter
vii
a
flirty
buccaneer
arrived
at
nassua
the
party
proceeded
to
the
king
edward
house
where
pauline
found
a
telegram
from
philip
carpenter
the
lawyer
advising
her
to
return
as
soon
as
possible
to
attend
the
signing
of
certain
important
papers
on
account
of
the
message
all
hands
made
haste
to
hunt
for
a
small
steamer
or
launch
to
complete
the
trip
though
none
of
the
four
saw
him
the
old
man
was
at
the
hotel
he
lost
no
time
in
assuming
another
and
very
different
disguise
observing
to
himself
that
the
most
valuable
part
of
his
college
education
might
prove
to
be
the
secrets
of
make
up
he
had
learned
in
his
college
dramatic
club
owen
with
his
usual
forethought
had
arranged
in
advance
to
be
put
in
touch
at
once
with
all
available
boats
as
a
result
a
gasoline
launch
with
a
cabin
and
stateroom
about
feet
long
which
had
once
been
a
yacht
was
chartered
the
pirate
stipulation
that
no
stranger
should
see
his
island
made
it
necessary
for
pauline
to
deposit
a
check
for
for
its
safe
return
the
next
morning
provisions
were
brought
aboard
the
pirate
declaring
that
he
could
run
the
engine
and
all
was
ready
when
a
difficulty
arose
who
was
to
cook
pauline
volunteered
but
owen
objected
and
finally
the
pirate
objections
to
a
stranger
were
overcome
a
with
long
black
hair
who
had
earned
half
a
dollar
by
helping
carry
things
on
board
volunteered
in
a
gruff
voice
fine
cook
best
cook
on
the
island
i
cook
very
cheap
time
was
too
valuable
to
investigate
the
man
ability
so
he
was
hired
off
went
the
white
launch
owen
steering
under
instructions
from
the
pirate
who
soon
proved
he
knew
gasoline
engines
out
of
the
harbor
they
went
and
then
coasted
along
the
beautiful
shores
of
the
island
the
sea
was
calm
and
the
cruise
uneventful
for
some
time
when
the
pirate
called
every
one
attention
to
the
fact
that
it
was
a
long
time
since
breakfast
he
went
below
and
addressed
the
cook
who
had
shut
himself
up
in
his
tiny
galley
as
sailors
call
a
kitchen
what
your
name
demanded
boyd
filipo
are
you
a
nigger
i
guess
so
i
dunno
well
what
were
your
father
and
mother
i
dunno
that
funny
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
soon
grub
will
be
ready
right
away
senor
all
right
filipo
see
that
there
is
plenty
of
it
dod
foul
my
hawser
if
this
ai
what
yer
might
call
pleasant
declared
the
pirate
showing
his
few
teeth
in
a
smile
that
reminded
pauline
of
the
spiles
of
an
abandoned
pier
pauline
was
pacing
the
deck
apart
from
the
others
in
a
pleasant
dreaminess
scanning
the
endless
azure
of
the
hashed
waters
her
thoughts
roamed
forward
and
backward
forward
to
the
vague
magic
land
of
adventure
where
she
was
to
win
treasure
and
delight
fortune
and
fame
backward
to
a
big
lovely
splendid
house
in
new
york
city
where
a
certain
tall
young
man
with
brown
unruly
hair
and
shoulders
broad
as
a
sheltering
wall
must
be
pining
for
her
some
one
began
whistling
in
the
cabin
pauline
paid
no
attention
to
it
at
first
but
as
the
tune
suddenly
shifted
to
the
very
latest
musical
comedy
air
she
became
interested
owen
never
whistled
and
hicks
she
imagined
seldom
went
to
the
theatres
the
song
shifted
from
whistle
to
words
i
a
greatly
wicked
person
if
there
anybody
worse
on
this
terrestrial
circumference
of
guile
though
i
very
broadly
doubt
it
i
should
like
to
know
about
it
for
i
want
to
be
the
blackest
thing
on
file
i
a
my
dear
i
a
liar
and
a
flyer
and
flirty
buccaneer
i
done
everything
that
awful
that
a
human
being
can
i
a
bad
man
the
song
from
harry
and
i
heard
it
only
two
weeks
ago
mused
pauline
moved
by
a
sudden
whimsy
she
entered
the
cabin
there
was
no
one
there
but
the
cook
in
his
dingy
linen
suit
he
was
standing
at
the
table
peeling
potatoes
and
whistling
he
stopped
as
pauline
entered
a
tall
powerful
man
though
of
slouching
posture
he
bowed
deferentially
no
like
me
sing
no
sing
he
suggested
on
the
contrary
i
like
it
very
much
you
sing
very
well
indeed
filipo
would
you
mind
telling
me
where
you
heard
the
song
you
were
just
singing
big
american
man
up
nassau
he
very
fine
man
big
fool
daughter
replied
filipo
you
speak
very
good
english
when
you
sing
remarked
pauline
why
do
you
do
it
all
the
time
the
cook
hesitated
speak
good
english
all
time
bad
english
when
sing
pauline
began
to
scrutinize
half
suspiciously
this
remarkable
menial
but
he
kept
stolidly
at
work
at
the
potatoes
and
his
dark
skin
his
scraggly
beard
his
bagging
trousers
upturned
over
bare
feet
his
general
dilapidation
of
appearance
proved
him
nothing
but
one
of
the
common
derelicts
of
the
languid
islands
if
you
could
peel
potatoes
instead
of
butchering
them
there
would
be
a
little
more
to
eat
in
case
we
run
out
of
supplies
filipo
suggested
pauline
he
turned
on
her
a
frank
american
grin
for
an
instant
the
twinkle
in
the
keen
blue
eyes
upset
her
it
was
so
like
the
twinkle
in
a
pair
of
keen
blue
eyes
that
were
supposed
to
be
figuratively
weeping
for
her
fate
in
new
york
but
instantly
he
changed
his
attitude
no
like
cook
cook
quit
he
grumbled
no
indeed
filipo
you
must
not
be
offended
i
was
just
speaking
to
owen
this
morning
about
raising
your
salary
a
thick
voice
came
to
them
from
the
cabin
door
i
begs
to
report
miss
said
blinky
boyd
the
pirate
reeling
in
that
there
be
in
yer
crew

and
owen
miss
has
rebelled
against

said
pauline
sympathetically
filipo
give
boyd
a
drink
drink
yes
meem
replied
filipo
with
such
unwonted
alacrity
that
pauline
turned
in
surprise
she
saw
the
slouching
figure
of
the
cook
suddenly
stiffen
to
his
full
stalwart
height
she
saw
an
ill
clad
but
majestic
giant
stride
toward
the
pirate
bowl
him
over
with
a
gentle
tap
pinion
his
arms
and
legs
in
a
lifting
grasp
and
carry
him
toward
the
door
of
the
cabin
cries
of
rage
came
stuffily
from
the
thick
throat
of
boyd
lem
me
go
ye
scum
lem
me
go
he
yelled
filipo
filipo
stop
this
instant
how
dare
you
treat
boyd
in
such
a
manner
cried
the
indignant
girl
you
say

say
lem

answered
filipo
pausing
with
his
squirming
burden
drink
ye
fool
drink
she
is
felling
ye
ter
gim
me
a
drink
screamed
the
hero
of
desperate
encounters
big
fat
drink
agreed
the
cook
as
he
strode
toward
the
rail
pauline
rushed
upon
him
the
peril
of
her
precious
pirate
stirred
all
her
courage
she
saw
her
dreams
vanishing
the
chief
narrator
navigator
and
guide
of
the
treasure
voyage
suspended
in
two
strong
arms
over
the
blue
deep
forgetting
that
he
was
accustomed
to
conquer
twenty
men
single
handed
she
felt
only
pity
for
his
plight
her
soft
but
determined
hand
gripped
the
cook
filipo
obey
my
orders
she
commanded
yes
mem
let
go
give
drink
big
liar
need
big
drink
he
lifted
the
struggling
but
utterly
helpless
form
of
the
pirate
over
his
shoulders
then
with
a
sudden
stooping
movement
he
made
as
if
to
plunge
it
into
the
sea
help
help
cried
pauline
running
up
the
deck
hicks
and
owen
rushed
from
their
staterooms
blinky
boyd
was
quivering
gasping
beside
the
rail
they
found
a
slouching
uncommunicative
cook
stolidly
washing
dishes
in
the
galley
some
hours
later
while
boyd
was
sleeping
off
his
potations
and
hicks
and
owen
were
deep
in
conference
on
deck
pauline
slipped
down
into
the
galley
ostensibly
to
explain
the
rudiments
of
the
culinary
art
to
the
cook
the
trouble
is
you
have
no
respect
for
a
potato
filipo
you
slash
the
poor
thing
to
pieces
and
then
you
boil
it
only
long
enough
to
hurt
its
feelings

consented
to

the
way
from
new
york
with
us
and
take
command
of
our
boat
and
find
the
buried
treasure
and
buried

snapped
filipo
with
a
sudden
reversion
to
his
unimpaired
english

filipo
with
upcast

again
she
eyed
him
through
her
long
lashes
a
little
askance
he
was
rather
subtle

cook

said
pauline

filipo
took
the
tiny
timepiece
from
pauline
hand
there
was
a
sound
as
of
some
one
choking
at
the
top
of
the
steps
the
cook
sprang
to
the
deck
but
there
was
no
one
in
sight
he
returned
to
pauline
while
blinky
boyd
gasping
more
from
astonishment
than
fear
reeled
up
to
owen
and
hicks
on
the
forward
deck

he

to
death
fer
wot
kind
o
nothin
says
i
boyd
smote
his
caving
chest
in
emphasis
of
his
accusations
and
he
would
have
the
diamond
watch
on
him
in
case
he
should
be
picked
up
suggested
hicks
quietly
that
so
said
owen
he
would
have
been
swimming
to
shore
with
the
stolen
watch
and
drowned
but
of
course
he
would
swim
to
shore
unless
well
it
a
case
of
making
sure
beforehand
we
could
persuade
him
to
go
in
and
try
to
kill
blinky
here
while
blinky
asleep
then
rush
in
and
finish
him
even
pauline
was
a
witness
to
the
attack
he
made
on
blinky
this
afternoon
the
pirate
glowing
countenance
suddenly
went
white
not
this
trip
he
said
fervently
i
ai
goin
to
kill
no
man
in
a
trap
like
that
i
goin
to
see
it
done
fair
and
square
in
the
open
with
plenty
o
drink
in
an
conscience
clear
i
see
no
man
die
with
murder
in
heart
fer
me
i
do
like
it
said
owen
nervously
i
do
like
the
idea
of
doing
too
much
we
got
one
big
piece
of
work
to
do
that
concerns
her
he
nodded
in
the
direction
of
the
cabin
dye
mean
to
say
we
ca
get
a
poor
cook
off
this
boat
without
killing
him
why
not
discharge
him
hicks
uttered
a
grim
chuckle
i
must
say
i
never
thought
of
that
get
a
boat
manned
will
you
boyd
and
we
put
him
ashore
within
half
an
hour
all
hands
bellowed
the
pirate
voice
the
all
hands
were
owen
hicks
the
pirate
and
pauline
why
all
hands
ca
you
handle
the
cook
yourself
said
owen
not
to
put
that
cook
ashore
ye
need
a
navy
said
boyd
backed
by
owen
and
hicks
he
moved
to
the
cabin
you
cook
there
ye
fired
get
off
the
boat
yer
kerriage
waits
he
cried
down
at
the
busy
filipo
filipo
shuffled
almost
meekly
toward
the
speaker
he
saw
the
skiff
alongside
and
hicks
and
owen
nearby
grab
ordered
the
pirate
here
the
irons
he
produced
a
pair
of
rusty
handcuffs
that
had
been
brought
along
among
other
junk
to
impress
pauline
but
filipo
was
not
fired
yet
with
a
sudden
lunge
he
knocked
down
the
pirate
who
thought
he
was
at
a
safe
distance
but
hicks
who
had
been
well
schooled
in
tactics
thoughtfully
stuck
out
a
leg
and
tripped
the
cook
who
fell
upon
the
groaning
boyd
boyd
though
down
was
by
no
means
out
and
held
filipo
tight
while
owen
and
hicks
slipped
on
the
handcuffs
now
to
the
boat
with
an
dump
ashore
wherever
it
looks
hottest
an
hungriest
yah
he
snarled
in
the
face
of
the
prostrate
cook
ye
interfere
no
more
with
the
capting
of
this
here
vessel
i
hopes
ye
but
his
sentence
was
cut
short
or
rather
it
ended
in
a
shriek
of
pain
and
fright
as
the
cook
suddenly
swinging
himself
from
his
shoulders
landed
a
terrifically
propelled
right
foot
in
the
pirate
middle
he
was
pinned
down
again
the
next
moment
but
boyd
yell
had
penetrated
to
the
cabin
what
is
the
matter
who
is
hurt
cried
pauline
rushing
to
the
group
on
deck
we
have
had
to
order
this
fellow
put
ashore
he
has
twice
attacked
boyd
and
besides
he
is
useless
as
a
cook
explained
owen
you
will
assuredly
do
nothing
of
the
sort
announced
pauline
you
will
take
those
horrid
iron
things
right
off
and
set
him
free
but
my
dear
miss
marvin
he
is
a
desperate
man
it
is
dangerous
what
did
we
come
here
for
but
to
get
into
danger
cried
pauline
besides
filipo
is
the
most
interesting
person
on
the
ship
i
have
just
devoted
a
chapter
to
him
in
my
book
and
if
you
think
i
going
to
spoil
my
book
because
boyd
gets
hurt
or
the
potatoes
are
done
you
much
mistaken
owen
obediently
knelt
and
unlocked
the
clumsy
handcuffs
you
are
free
filipo
said
pauline
with
the
air
of
a
proud
princess
releasing
a
serf
no
fired
grunted
filipo
too
bad
bum
job
now
go
back
to
the
kitchen
and
promise
not
to
strike
boyd
any
more
no
hit
boil
three
minutes
stick
fork
in
hum
said
the
cook
with
a
cannibal
glare
at
the
still
writhing
pirate
he
shuffled
off
to
his
pots
and
pans
blinky
scrambled
to
his
bunk
and
pauline
retired
to
elaborate
the
fascinating
character
of
filipo
in
another
chapter
of
her
book
of
adventure
she
did
not
realize
how
late
it
was
when
at
last
she
put
down
her
pen
and
moved
with
soft
slippered
steps
to
the
door
of
the
cabin
over
the
great
vault
of
the
heavens
the
stars
were
sprinkled
like
silver
dust
the
boat
rolled
softly
dreamily
on
the
listless
waters
a
cool
breeze
scented
with
the
fragrance
of
the
spicy
land
cooled
her
brow
she
realized
that
her
little
stateroom
had
been
very
stuffy
it
was
beautiful
here
in
the
hushed
night
alone
she
moved
out
on
deck
they
had
come
to
anchor
for
the
night
off
andrew
and
the
few
faint
lights
of
the
town
tinged
the
scene
with
life
pauline
was
thinking
of
harry
it
would
have
been
nice
if
he
were
here
now
in
the
moonlight
just
for
this
evening
of
course
if
he
were
a
regular
member
of
the
party
he
would
spoil
the
trip
by
his
grumpiness
and
probably
prevent
them
from
finding
any
treasure
at
all
but
harry
was
a
good
companion
usually
and
pauline
was
getting
a
little
tired
of
the
company
on
the
yacht
the
night
was
so
still
that
even
her
light
footstep
could
be
heard
on
the
deck
and
she
was
surprised
to
hear
a
muffled
hail
from
some
invisible
craft
astern
as
she
moved
to
the
rail
her
tall
form
in
the
yachting
suit
standing
out
plainly
in
the
moonlight
she
saw
a
small
boat
scurry
away
she
thought
she
recognized
their
own
small
boat
the
one
the
yacht
towed
and
she
quickly
made
sure
that
this
was
true
pauline
turned
toward
the
cabin
to
rouse
the
others
for
a
real
pirate
chase
when
she
was
silenced
and
stunned
by
the
sight
of
filipo
the
cook
staggering
out
of
the
galley
with
his
bearded
chin
drooping
on
his
breast
his
knees
swaying
under
him
his
arms
weaving
cubist
caricatures
in
the
air
and
his
voice
raised
in
unintelligible
song
he
was
quickly
followed
by
the
pirate
who
to
pauline
amazement
actually
presented
a
picture
of
sobriety
in
contrast
to
filipo
but
on
seeing
her
boyd
looked
frightened
they
have
stolen
the
skiff
cried
pauline
no
miss
said
boyd
they
was
four
of
come
aboard
in
one
boat
an
we
let
take
ourn
ashore
to
bring
a
double
load
o
supplies
pauline
was
grievously
disappointed
she
turned
her
wrath
upon
the
musical
and
meandering
filipo
filipo
she
demanded
go
to
bed
at
once
for
answer
he
reeled
toward
her
cook
boiled
boiled
three
minute
he
said
then
with
a
lurch
he
fell
sprawling
at
her
feet
boyd
had
started
back
to
the
cabin
in
haste
and
excitement
first
instinct
was
to
leave
the
inebriated
man
but
pity
mastered
her
and
she
stooped
to
lift
him
he
sprang
to
his
feet
without
her
aid
his
blue
eyes
looked
clearly
into
hers
his
body
towered
again
to
its
commanding
height
as
it
had
done
when
he
was
about
to
finish
the
pirate
he
stooped
and
spoke
rapidly
sharply
in
her
ear
there
was
no
pigeon
chatter
it
was
straight
english
but
as
the
door
of
the
cabin
opened
again
and
boyd
came
out
the
tall
form
sank
into
itself
the
knees
began
to
rock
the
arms
to
weave
and
staggering
back
up
the
deck
he
disappeared
in
the
cabin
pauline
stood
stupefied
she
had
been
so
startled
by
the
sudden
transformation
of
the
man
that
she
had
hardly
understood
his
strident
words
only
one
thing
she
could
remember
he
had
commanded
her
to
go
to
bed
and
bar
her
door
she
obeyed
but
she
could
not
sleep
at
first
it
seemed
that
hours
had
passed
when
a
sound
outside
her
door
brought
her
to
her
feet
she
moved
to
the
door
and
softly
opened
it
across
the
threshold
lay
filipo
wide
awake
go
to
bed
he
said
again
she
obeyed
and
this
time
she
slept
the
next
morning
everything
seemed
outwardly
as
usual
the
skiff
had
been
restored
to
its
place
astern
the
pirate
was
intoxicated
the
cook
sober
but
there
was
the
threat
of
trouble
in
the
air
pauline
felt
it
in
the
attitude
of
all
the
men
even
of
owen
and
hicks
the
pirate
showed
a
strange
new
tendency
to
make
friends
with
filipo
can
you
steer
cook
he
asked
after
the
latter
had
announced
that
dinner
was
ready
yes
said
filipo
all
right
take
the
wheel
and
keep
her
as
she
going
till
we
round
that
point
ahead
there
filipo
took
the
wheel
and
the
others
descended
to
find
the
cabin
table
set
there
was
a
prodigious
amount
of
fried
steak
and
boiled
potatoes
as
the
main
part
of
the
meal
to
their
dismay
they
found
the
steak
was
as
tough
as
leather
a
wail
of
sorrow
arose
when
the
potatoes
proved
to
be
so
hard
that
pauline
doubted
if
they
had
been
boiled
more
than
three
minutes
the
pirate
whose
table
manners
savored
of
the
forecastle
tried
a
biscuit
and
found
it
as
hard
as
stone
and
almost
as
heavy
in
his
anger
he
hurled
it
at
the
side
of
the
cabin
and
was
horrified
to
see
it
go
through
the
boat
side
he
did
not
know
that
the
biscuit
happened
to
strike
a
hole
that
had
been
temporarily
stopped
up
with
putty
and
paint
he
turned
speechless
to
the
others
and
saw
hicks
lift
a
biscuit
on
high
about
to
dash
it
onto
the
cabin
floor
with
instant
presence
of
mind
he
seized
the
arm
of
hicks
and
in
a
hoarse
voice
shouted
do
do
that
you
sink
the
ship
look
what
mine
did
they
all
gazed
in
amazement
at
the
ragged
aperture
in
the
side
of
the
cabin
through
which
the
sparkling
waters
of
the
atlantic
could
be
seen
dancing
past
events
moved
swiftly
that
afternoon
owen
peering
in
the
galley
porthole
beheld
the
disguised
cook
remove
his
wig
to
wash
his
face
and
recognized
the
curly
light
hair
of
harry
about
four
the
launch
tied
up
to
the
landing
at
the
small
village
of
andrew
there
owen
had
opportunity
to
reveal
his
discovery
of
harry
presence
to
the
other
two
conspirators
they
were
frightened
at
first
but
soon
agreed
that
it
was
a
fine
chance
to
get
rid
of
both
at
the
same
time
the
pirate
confided
to
them
that
he
had
brought
a
bomb
along
and
had
it
in
his
bag
a
few
minutes
discussion
produced
a
simple
plan
owen
sent
the
disguised
harry
with
a
bucket
in
search
of
a
spring
and
pauline
was
already
hunting
strange
flowers
among
the
palms
and
creepers
this
left
the
conspirators
free
to
place
the
bomb
under
the
cabin
floor
boards
a
matter
which
owen
attended
to
himself
it
was
set
to
explode
two
hours
later
pauline
and
filipo
were
then
summoned
and
told
that
there
were
comfortable
lodgings
and
a
good
meal
obtainable
at
a
village
just
the
other
side
of
the
long
narrow
point
of
land
if
pauline
and
boyd
and
filipo
would
go
around
in
the
launch
owen
and
hicks
would
climb
through
the
jungle
and
get
there
in
time
to
have
a
meal
already
upon
the
boat
arrival
the
two
parties
separated
and
all
was
quiet
for
some
time
pauline
sat
on
deck
with
the
pirate
endeavoring
to
engage
him
in
conversation
but
he
grew
surlier
and
surlier
in
his
answers
looking
frequently
at
his
watch
and
often
stopping
below
for
a
drink
after
about
an
hour
and
pauline
became
a
little
frightened
at
his
behavior
and
descended
to
the
cabin
there
was
the
cook
reading
a
cook
book
evidently
his
own
the
moment
pauline
was
out
of
sight
the
pirate
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
and
abandoned
the
wheel
stepping
softly
to
the
stern
he
pulled
in
the
small
boat
which
was
towing
astern
leaped
in
adroitly
and
cut
it
adrift
filipo
said
pauline
you
told
us
you
were
a
good
cook
yes
senorita
i
thought
i
was
have
you
ever
cooked
before
no
but
i
have
a
cook
book
which
tells
you
how
every
one
may
be
a
cook
i
thought
filipo
did
not
finish
his
sentence
his
eyes
were
roving
around
the
cabin
in
search
of
something
and
pauline
was
looking
very
hard
at
him
what
that
ticking
sound
inquired
the
cook
he
went
to
the
cabin
clock
and
listened
no
it
was
that
pauline
could
hear
it
too
and
it
was
her
tiny
watch
filipo
made
a
search
of
the
cabin
and
finally
located
the
sound
under
the
floor
a
moment
more
and
he
had
laid
bare
the
pirate
bomb
he
leaped
on
deck
and
took
in
at
a
glance
that
the
pirate
had
left
in
the
only
boat
in
another
instant
he
was
below
again
tearing
off
his
wig
polly
it
i
there
an
infernal
machine
ticking
here
ready
to
blow
us
up
he
tried
to
lift
up
the
bomb
but
it
was
wedged
fast
harry
for
heaven
sake
what
do
you
mean
i
tell
you
in
a
minute
in
the
water
as
soon
as
we
have
jumped
overboard
come
he
seized
pauline
carried
her
up
on
deck
where
mr
boyd
gone
take
this
answered
harry
putting
a
life
preserver
around
her
now
will
you
jump
or
shall
i
throw
you
overboard
one
two
three
i
jump
said
pauline
and
with
arms
around
each
other
they
leaped
into
the
warm
ocean
on
went
the
white
launch
serene
and
unruffled
by
the
desertion
of
its
crew
in
answer
to
pauline
demand
for
explanation
harry
only
answered
wait
finally
it
came
a
belch
of
flame
shot
up
from
the
launch
driving
a
column
of
smoke
far
into
the
sky
where
it
spread
out
and
formed
a
majestic
ring
which
floated
and
curled
for
many
moments
a
concussion
reached
them
through
the
water
and
another
in
the
air
smote
their
ears
the
after
part
of
the
launch
rode
on
the
waters
for
a
moment
and
then
disappeared
finally
a
succession
of
waves
tossed
them
and
passed
on
what
does
it
mean
gasped
the
girl
insanity
sheer
downright
insanity
that
wretch
of
a
was
a
crazy
man
he
placed
that
bomb
intending
to
kill
all
of
us
and
owen
deserves
a
sound
thrashing
for
having
anything
to
do
with
such
a
murderous
lunatic
i
think
you
rather
hard
on
owen
harry
said
pauline
of
course
we
all
know
that
pirates
are
nice
persons
but
nobody
could
foresee
that
the
man
was
crazy
well
perhaps
but
do
talk
we
have
a
mile
and
a
half
swim
to
shore
they
were
spared
that
ordeal
by
the
silurian
liner
caradoc
arrayed
in
borrowed
clothes
they
were
notified
of
a
second
rescue
and
came
out
on
deck
in
time
to
behold
in
the
dusk
of
evening
the
pirate
he
was
relating
to
an
admiring
throng
how
he
had
stuck
by
the
burning
ship
till
it
exploded
he
had
actually
been
blown
into
the
air
and
had
fallen
by
good
luck
into
the
little
boat
it
a
lie
said
harry
in
the
old
man
cackling
voice
the
pirate
heard
the
voice
of
the
old
man
and
saw
the
face
and
the
blond
hair
of
harry
it
was
too
much
for
his
evil
and
murderous
mind
to
bear
with
a
shriek
he
hurled
himself
over
the
rail
into
the
sea
the
caradoc
stopped
and
searched
but
no
trace
of
the
pirate
could
be
found
chapter
viii
the
courtelyou
reception
two
weeks
later
pauline
and
harry
were
sitting
in
the
library
through
the
blinds
a
soft
breeze
bore
to
them
the
fragrance
of
carnations
and
roses
for
the
first
few
days
after
their
return
pauline
was
so
thankful
they
had
not
lost
their
lives
that
she
was
reconciled
to
not
having
found
the
treasure
but
only
for
the
first
few
days
she
was
already
growing
restless
you
wasting
time
harry
she
said
impatiently
i
rather
face
anything
than
be
bored
to
death
polly
it
got
to
stop
it
is
safe
it
is
sensible
it
even
fun
any
more
wo
you
drop
the
whole
freakish
thing
and
marry
me
harry
was
holding
pauline
by
the
hand
as
she
drew
her
dainty
way
out
of
the
library
in
laughing
rebellion
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
and
jeered
at
him
oh
i
thought
it
was
i
who
was
going
to
be
afraid
she
said
well
if
you
are
who
is
going
to
be
you
she
tittered
he
drew
her
back
with
a
gentle
but
firm
grasp
honestly
polly
are
you
satisfied
yet
adventure
is
all
right
for
breakfast
or
for
luncheon
once
a
month
but
as
a
regular
unremitting
diet
it
gets
on
my
nerves
still
thinking
of
your
own
perils
she
volleyed
harry
fine
keen
face
took
on
a
look
of
earnest
appeal
he
let
go
her
hand
but
as
she
started
to
run
up
the
stairs
he
held
her
with
his
eyes
you
dear
silly
boy
she
cried
returning
a
step
and
clasping
him
in
an
impetuous
embrace
you
are
the
nicest
brother
in
all
the
world
sometimes
but
just
now
i
think
that
adventure
is
nicer
than
brothers
or
husbands
i
having
the
time
of
my
life
harry
boy
and
going
on
and
on
and
on
with
it
until
i
seen
all
the
wild
and
wicked
people
and
places
in
the
world
harry
caught
her
hand
and
smiled
down
at
her
in
surrender
a
ring
at
the
door
bell
and
the
entrance
of
the
maid
caused
pauline
to
flutter
up
the
stairs
they
were
preparing
to
attend
the
reception
that
evening
to
the
great
baskinelli
whose
musical
achievements
had
been
equaled
only
by
his
social
successes
during
this
his
first
new
york
season
anyway
she
twinkled
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
you
need
be
frightened
for
tonight
nothing
so
meek
and
mild
as
a
pianist
can
hurt
you
harry
tossed
up
his
hands
in
mimic
despair
and
started
back
to
the
library
yes
i
know
she
is
always
at
home
to
you
miss
hamlin
the
maid
was
saying
at
the
door
what
a
privileged
person
i
am
laughed
lucille
hamlin
she
was
pauline
a
dark
still
tempered
girl
in
perfect
contrast
to
the
adventurous
polly
she
greeted
harry
with
the
easy
grace
of
old
acquaintanceship
still
nursing
the
precious
broken
heart
she
queried
for
the
love
of
michael
me
and
humanity
he
pleaded
ca
you
do
something
she
wo
listen
to
me
i
honestly
deucedly
worried
lucille
you
know
very
well
that
nobody
could
ever
do
anything
with
polly
she
always
had
to
have
her
own
way
and
that
why
you
love
her
though
you
do
know
it
harry
shall
i
run
upstairs
margaret
she
added
turning
to
the
maid
no
you
going
to
stay
here
commanded
harry
seizing
her
hands
you
got
to
do
something
with
pauline
you
the
only
one
who
can
she
wants
a
new
adventure
every
day
and
a
more
dangerous
one
every
time
talk
to
her
wo
you
tell
her
it
is
right
for
her
to
risk
her
life
when
her
life
is
so
precious
to
so
many
people
no
wait
a
minute
sit
down
here
i
not
half
through
yet
he
drew
her
under
laughing
protest
to
a
seat
beside
him
on
the
stairs
she
realized
suddenly
how
serious
he
was
she
let
her
hand
rest
comradely
in
his
pleading
grasp
why
harry
yes
if
it
is
really
dangerous
you
know
i
do
anything
i
can
she
said
gravely
they
did
not
see
the
cold
gray
face
of
raymond
owen
appear
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
the
face
vanished
as
quickly
as
it
had
appeared
in
her
boudoir
polly
was
laying
out
her
finery
of
the
evening
there
came
a
soft
rap
at
the
door
come
in
she
called
and
looked
up
brightly
in
owen
furtive
eyes
as
he
opened
the
door
and
motioned
to
her
do
say
anything
please
miss
marvin
he
whispered
just
come
with
me
for
a
moment
bewildered
by
his
manner
she
followed
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
he
directed
her
gaze
to
the
two
young
people
in
earnest
conversation
below
it
was
a
picture
that
might
well
have
startled
a
less
impetuous
heart
than
pauline
harry
hand
still
clasped
lucille
and
he
was
leaning
toward
her
in
the
eagerness
of
his
appeal
you
will
you
promise
lucille
you
made
me
happy
pauline
heard
him
say
through
eyes
dizzily
she
saw
the
two
arise
she
saw
the
man
she
loved
clasp
lucille
other
hand
she
saw
the
girl
who
had
been
her
friend
and
confidante
since
childhood
draw
herself
away
from
him
with
a
lingering
withdrawal
that
could
mean
ah
what
could
it
not
mean
polly
fled
to
her
room
in
owen
subtle
secret
battle
to
retain
control
of
the
marvin
millions
fate
had
never
so
befriended
him
none
of
all
the
weapons
or
ruses
that
he
had
used
to
prevent
the
faithful
attachment
of
harry
and
pauline
was
as
potent
as
this
little
seed
of
jealousy
pauline
rang
for
her
maid
tell
miss
hamlin
that
i
am
not
at
home
she
said
in
a
voice
that
started
haughtily
but
ended
in
a
sob
but
miss
marvin
margaret
tried
to
demur
tell
miss
hamlin
that
i
am
not
at
home
repeated
pauline
lucille
had
just
started
up
the
stairs
leaving
harry
with
a
sympathetic
pat
on
the
shoulder
well
even
if
i
caret
do
anything
with
that
wild
woman
she
laughed
back
at
him
you
know
pauline
bears
a
charmed
life
nothing
has
ever
happened
to
her
yet
guardian
angels
surround
her
as
well
as
heroes
harry
walked
into
the
library
the
agitated
margaret
met
lucille
on
the
stairs
miss
marvin
is
miss
marvin
is
not
at
home
the
girl
said
flushing
crimson
lucille
paused
dumfounded
but
margaret
you
know
i
thought
i
really
thought
she
was
at
home
miss
hamlin
i
hope
you
wo
be
offended
with
me
i
insist
upon
seeing
her
cried
lucille
i
do
believe
you
are
telling
me
the
truth
i
going
right
up
to
her
room
margaret
burst
into
tears
lucille
quickly
reconsidered
indignation
took
the
place
of
astonishment
she
hurried
down
the
stairs
and
rushed
through
the
door
without
waiting
for
margaret
to
open
it
pauline
back
in
her
own
room
vented
her
first
rage
in
tears
with
her
hot
face
pressed
against
the
pillow
she
sobbed
out
the
agony
of
what
she
thought
her
betrayal
her
double
betrayal
by
courtier
and
comrade
at
once
but
the
tears
passed
too
vital
was
the
spirit
in
her
too
red
flowing
in
her
veins
was
the
blood
of
fighting
ancestors
too
strong
the
fortress
of
within
the
blossoming
gardens
of
her
youth
and
beauty
for
the
word
surrender
ever
to
come
to
her
mind
true
she
had
found
an
adventure
that
stirred
her
more
deeply
than
the
peril
of
land
or
sea
or
sky
could
have
done
here
was
a
thrill
that
had
never
been
listed
among
her
intended
tremors
she
sent
for
owen
masked
as
ever
in
his
suave
exterior
and
his
manner
of
mingled
obsequiousness
and
fatherliness
he
came
instantly
owen
have
you
known
have
you
known
that
this
was
going
on
i
feel
that
it
is
my
duty
to
know
what
concerns
you
even
what
concerns
your
happiness
miss
marvin
he
answered
you
mean
i
mean
that
i
have
long
had
my
suspicions
but
again
the
very
perfection
of
his
deceit
brought
pauline
that
feeling
that
she
had
had
since
childhood
that
sense
of
an
insidious
influence
always
surrounding
her
always
menacing
and
yet
never
revealed
this
influence
which
owen
seemed
to
embody
was
the
antagonist
of
that
other
mysterious
power
so
real
and
yet
so
inexplicable
that
warded
and
protected
her
the
spirit
of
the
girl
that
had
stepped
from
the
mummy
but
pauline
had
seen
with
her
own
eyes
she
did
not
need
any
word
of
owen
to
convince
her
of
the
falsity
of
her
lover
she
was
quite
calm
now
she
dressed
with
the
utmost
care
margaret
who
had
seen
her
in
such
anger
only
a
short
time
before
was
surprised
at
her
sprightliness
and
graciousness
a
slightly
heightened
color
that
only
added
to
the
luster
of
her
loveliness
was
the
single
sign
of
her
inward
thoughts
she
summoned
her
own
car
and
left
the
house
alone
the
drawing
room
of
the
clarence
courtelyou
mansion
was
ablaze
with
light
there
was
a
little
too
much
light
the
clarence
courtelyou
always
had
a
little
too
much
of
everything
there
was
a
little
too
much
money
there
was
a
little
too
much
gold
leaf
decoration
in
the
drawing
room
a
little
too
much
diamond
decoration
of
courtelyou
and
if
you
were
so
fastidiously
impolite
as
to
say
so
a
little
too
much
of
courtelyou
herself
but
courtelyou
was
struggling
toward
gentility
in
such
an
amiable
way
that
better
people
liked
her
the
motherliness
and
sweet
sincerity
of
her
the
fact
that
she
loved
her
frankly
illiterate
husband
and
worshipped
almost
from
afar
her
cultured
daughters
was
the
thing
that
brought
her
down
from
the
base
height
of
the
climbers
and
lifted
her
kindly
harmless
personality
to
the
high
simplicities
of
the
elite
she
made
the
natural
mistake
that
other
wealthy
mendicants
at
the
outer
portals
of
society
have
made
the
mistake
of
pounding
at
the
gates
instead
of
letting
the
splendor
of
her
charitable
gifts
the
gracefulness
of
her
simplicity
carry
her
through
she
went
in
for
the
gorgeous
and
the
costly
as
a
sort
of
crowning
glory
she
began
to
take
up
artists
and
actors
and
musicians
she
gained
the
good
graces
of
the
best
of
them
and
in
her
kindly
innocence
she
won
the
worship
of
the
worst
it
was
thus
that
she
came
to
the
point
of
holding
a
reception
for
baskinelli
not
that
any
one
had
heard
anything
black
or
even
shadowy
against
baskinelli
he
had
arrived
recently
from
abroad
his
foreign
fame
preceding
him
his
prospective
conquests
of
america
fulsomely
foretold
his
low
brow
decorated
in
advance
with
laurel
courtelyou
added
him
to
her
collection
with
the
swiftness
and
directness
of
the
entomologist
discovering
a
new
bug
she
herself
loved
music
without
understanding
it
very
deeply
and
baskinelli
whatever
might
be
his
other
gifts
could
summon
all
the
cadences
of
love
from
the
machines
that
people
call
a
piano
engine
of
torture
or
instrument
of
joy
for
half
an
hour
harry
paced
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
i
wonder
if
she
ever
coming
he
fumed
to
himself
it
takes
so
long
to
do
it
that
they
drive
you
crazy
and
when
it
done
they
so
wonderful
that
they
drive
you
crazy
did
you
did
you
wish
anything
sir
asked
the
butler
entering
no
just
waiting
for
miss
pauline
jenkins
just
waiting
sighed
harry
why
if
i
may
presume
to
tell
you
sir
miss
marvin
has
gone
to
the
reception
said
jenkins
gone
harry
cried
abruptly
hotly
then
remembered
that
he
was
speaking
to
a
servant
and
swung
into
the
reception
room
he
put
on
his
hat
and
coat
and
rang
for
jenkins
again
how
long
ago
was
it
that
miss
pauline
went
out
almost
an
hour
ago
sir
harry
slammed
his
way
out
of
the
door
it
was
not
until
he
was
in
the
car
on
his
way
to
the
courtelyous
that
he
began
to
think
began
to
think
with
utterly
wrong
deductions
as
lovers
always
do
i
must
have
said
too
much
he
told
himself
she
crazy
about
these
wild
pranks
and
she
thinks
i
a
stupid
what
a
fool
i
was
to
try
to
prevent
her
you
are
very
nice
marvin
to
snub
my
pet
musician
my
very
newest
pet
musician
courtelyou
rebuked
him
as
he
entered
i
did
mean
it
i
was
waiting
for
why
my
car
went
to
pieces
he
explained
is
pauline
here
here
she
is
the
only
person
present
baskinelli
has
spoken
a
word
to
any
one
else
he
wo
play
anything
unless
she
suggests
the
subject
i
am
glad
owen
is
here
to
protect
her
from
the
scintillant
filmy
mist
of
women
around
the
piano
lucille
emerged
she
came
swiftly
to
harry
side
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
what
is
tell
me
he
replied
what
did
you
say
to
her
i
did
see
her
harry
she
sent
word
that
she
was
not
at
home
you
do
mean
not
after
you
started
upstairs
yes
and
she
has
spoken
to
me
all
evening
and
she
left
me
waiting
at
home
for
half
an
hour
it
outrageous
harry
strode
across
the
floor
just
as
the
music
ceased
and
baskinelli
arose
bowing
to
the
applause
of
his
feminine
admirers
may
i
ask
the
honor
to
show
to
you
madame
courtelyou
portrait
of
myself
it
is
called
glorification
of
imbecility
he
said
as
he
proffered
his
arm
to
pauline
he
was
a
small
man
with
sharp
features
shadowed
by
a
mass
of
flowing
curling
hair
the
kind
of
hair
that
has
come
to
be
called
musical
by
the
irreverent
the
sweep
of
an
abnormal
brow
gave
emphasis
to
the
sudden
jut
of
deep
eye
sockets
and
a
dull
sallow
skin
gave
emphasis
to
the
subtle
sinister
light
of
the
eyes
themselves
pauline
accepted
the
proffered
arm
of
the
artist
but
daintily
laughingly
she
turned
him
back
to
the
piano
you
have
yet
escaped
signor
baskinelli
she
said
we
have
not
yet
heard
you
know
tivoli
he
cried
with
hands
upraised
in
mock
disdain
why
i
wrote
the
thing
myself
am
i
to
violate
even
my
own
masterpieces
there
was
a
twitter
of
mocking
protest
from
the
women
baskinelli
began
to
play
again
pauline
may
i
speak
to
you
just
a
moment
harry
vexed
voice
reached
her
ear
as
she
stood
beside
the
piano
she
turned
slowly
and
looked
into
his
bewildered
angry
eyes
a
little
later
possibly
she
answered
and
instantly
turned
back
to
baskinelli
from
her
no
mask
of
music
no
glamour
of
others
admiration
could
hide
the
predatory
obsequiousness
of
baskinelli
she
was
not
in
the
least
interested
in
baskinelli
she
had
loathed
him
from
the
moment
when
she
had
looked
down
on
his
little
oily
curls
but
if
baskinelli
had
been
beelzebub
he
would
have
enjoyed
the
favor
of
pauline
that
evening
at
least
after
harry
had
arrived
the
glowing
piquant
beauty
of
pauline
enthralled
baskinelli
he
had
never
before
seen
a
woman
like
her
innocent
but
astute
daring
but
demure
brilliant
but
opalescent
when
at
last
they
strolled
away
together
into
the
conservatory
his
drawing
room
obeisances
became
direct
declarations
of
love
pauline
began
to
be
frightened
she
fluttered
to
the
door
of
the
conservatory
but
there
she
paused
voices
sounded
from
the
end
of
a
little
alley
they
were
the
voices
of
harry
and
lucille
baskinelli
was
at
her
side
again
if
i
have
said
anything
done
anything
to
offend
he
said
with
affected
contrition
you
will
let
me
make
my
lowliest
apologies
you
pauline
hardly
heard
him
she
was
intently
listening
to
the
low
pitched
voices
i
i
think
i
will
run
back
to
the
others
she
cried
suddenly
baskinelli
was
left
alone
i
congratulate
you
signor
on
the
success
of
the
evening
said
a
voice
at
his
shoulder
there
are
few
among
the
famous
who
can
conquer
drawing
rooms
as
well
as
auditoriums
the
musician
turned
to
face
the
ingratiating
smile
of
raymond
owen
i
thank
you
i
thank
you
sir
but
i
do
not
believe
you
my
has
turned
to
catastrophe
i
have
lost
everything
you
mean
that
you
are
dissatisfied
with
the
applause
asked
owen
no
no
applause
is
nothing
from
the
many
there
is
always
one
in
his
audience
to
whom
he
plays
from
his
soul
and
that
one
tonight
the
lovely
miss
what
now
is
her
name
marvin
she
bewitches
me
and
she
scorns
me
signor
baskinelli
there
are
other
places
than
drawing
rooms
or
even
conservatories
in
which
to
capture
those
who
captivate
i
do
i
quite
grasp
your
meaning
mistaire
owen
he
tried
to
disguise
the
suspicion
under
an
accentuated
accent
i
think
so
monsieur
picquot
at
the
name
baskinelli
turned
livid
he
made
a
movement
as
if
he
would
lunge
at
the
throat
of
owen
but
his
fury
withered
under
the
glassy
smile
so
we
met
in
paris
once
upon
a
time
a
little
incident
in
the
rue
jeanne
a
young
woman
was
concerned
in
that
incident
and
was
not
heard
of
afterward
and
you
are
trying
to
blackmail
me
for
the
death
of
marie
disart
ha
that
is
a
jest
cried
baskinelli
i
am
trying
to
do
nothing
of
the
kind
i
simply
reminded
you
of
the
little
affair
i
know
as
well
as
you
that
it
was
all
beautifully
cleared
up
and
a
man
is
still
in
prison
for
it
i
know
you
are
as
safe
here
as
that
man
is
in
jail
signor
baskinelli
what
are
you
talking
about
then
the
little
woman
that
so
charmed
you
here
i
remarked
merely
that
those
who
are
captivated
can
capture
not
in
this
country
not
among
the
puritans
one
must
be
good
and
unhappy
you
have
forgotten
your
little
friends
mario
and
di
palma
and
vitrio
they
are
all
respected
residents
of
new
york
we
know
where
they
might
be
found
at
cagliacci
precisely
dining
upon
the
best
of
spaghetti
and
the
richest
of
wines
and
paying
for
it
at
the
point
of
a
stiletto
but
ha
you
are
talking
nonsense
we
could
not
find
them
they
could
not
find
us
we
might
telephone
and
try
suggested
owen
cagliacci
you
know
is
now
he
has
a
telephone
he
considers
it
a
sign
of
respectability
and
then
what
do
you
propose
picquot
i
mean
signor
baskinelli
i
propose
nothing
unless
possibly
there
might
be
after
the
reception
a
little
motor
trip
to
chinatown
it
might
amuse
the
ladies
you
are
right
i
will
invite
them
all
said
baskinelli
and
how
about
calling
up
marie
at
cagliacci
just
as
an
old
friend
it
might
be
best
they
moved
together
down
the
corridor
and
owen
directed
their
way
to
a
little
study
secluded
from
all
other
apartments
of
the
great
house
you
seem
to
be
familiar
with
the
home
of
our
gracious
hostess
remarked
baskinelli
i
make
it
a
rule
to
be
familiar
with
all
homes
in
which
miss
marvin
is
entertained
miss
marvin
you
are
then
a
relative
i
am
her
guardian
you
have
control
perhaps
of
certain
small
sums
bequeathed
to
her
yes
and
you
would
like
to
have
as
few
persons
as
possible
in
the
chinatown
party
as
few
as
possible
in
a
place
known
only
as
cagliacci
in
the
dreg
depths
of
elizabeth
street
the
ringing
of
the
telephone
bell
was
much
more
startling
much
more
unusual
than
the
crash
of
a
pistol
shot
or
the
blast
of
a
bomb
the
habitu
moved
quietly
to
the
door
that
leads
to
the
roofs
while
pietro
cagliacci
himself
wiped
the
receiver
on
his
apron
and
put
it
to
his
ear
he
spoke
softly
tersely
the
conversation
was
very
brief
within
a
minute
after
he
had
hung
up
the
receiver
three
men
left
the
place
silently
harry
and
lucille
came
out
of
the
conservatory
i
tell
you
there
was
anything
said
between
us
that
could
have
caused
it
he
was
saying
i
was
fighting
the
whole
thing
hard
but
i
was
fighting
it
like
a
beggar
i
am
always
a
beggar
with
pauline
but
you
told
her
it
was
right
that
she
was
risking
other
lives
no
i
told
you
to
tell
her
that
in
spite
of
her
distress
over
pauline
coldness
lucille
burst
into
laughter
they
were
just
emerging
into
the
music
room
pauline
like
the
others
turned
at
the
unexpected
sound
she
gave
one
glance
at
the
two
and
turned
haughtily
away
baskinelli
was
bustling
about
making
up
an
impromptu
excursion
party
ha
you
people
of
new
york
you
do
not
know
what
is
in
new
york
all
europe
is
here
and
you
never
cross
fourteenth
street
i
mean
to
say
fifth
avenue
it
is
more
dangerous
to
cross
fifth
avenue
than
to
cross
the
ocean
that
probably
the
reason
said
harry
the
traffic
cops
along
the
gulf
stream
are
so
careful
pauline
stopped
baskinelli
intended
reply
she
wanted
harry
to
be
ignored
utterly
her
anger
had
made
him
flippant
his
flippancy
had
put
the
seal
of
completeness
upon
her
anger
chapter
ix
baskinelli
quarry
a
flutter
of
polite
alarm
attended
signor
baskinalli
invitation
from
the
sheltered
glitter
of
a
fifth
avenue
drawing
room
to
chinatown
was
a
plunge
a
little
too
deep
but
baskinelli
was
insistent
and
pauline
was
his
ardent
and
efficient
recruiting
officer
quite
a
troop
train
of
limousines
carried
the
invaders
to
the
uncelestial
haunts
of
the
celestials
baskinelli
rode
in
the
car
with
pauline
and
owen
he
had
cast
off
the
dignity
of
the
master
musician
and
assumed
an
air
of
whimsical
recklessness
harry
and
lucille
were
in
the
following
car
oh
please
stop
fidgeting
exclaimed
lucille
i
as
nervous
as
you
are
i
know
said
harry
but
i
hate
to
have
her
alone
with
that
little
black
snake
for
five
minutes
owen
is
with
them
owen
is
worse
the
machines
drew
up
in
chatham
square
and
the
little
procession
that
moved
across
to
doyers
street
dainty
slippers
on
blackened
cobblestones
light
laughter
tinkling
under
the
thunder
of
the
l
human
brightness
brushing
past
the
human
shadows
from
the
midnight
dens
made
contrasts
picturesque
as
a
pageant
in
a
catacomb
pauline
on
the
arm
of
the
chattering
baskinelli
led
the
way
is
this
splendid
she
exclaimed
i
am
sure
you
wo
disappoint
me
signor
baskinelli
i
hope
you
are
going
to
show
us
a
happy
chinese
family
at
supper
only
the
most
dreadful
sights
amuse
me
ali
but
we
must
not
take
risks
replied
baskinelli
there
are
some
beings
in
the
world
miss
marvin
so
exquisitely
precious
that
a
man
would
commit
sin
if
he
placed
them
in
peril
but
only
the
worst
and
wickedest
places
she
admonished
baskinelli
he
leaned
suddenly
very
near
to
her
do
you
really
mean
that
miss
marvin
he
asked
indeed
i
do
she
answered
very
well
but
first
we
shall
go
to
the
new
restaurant
it
is
yet
too
early
for
the
worst
and
wickedest
to
be
abroad
or
rather
to
seek
their
lairs
they
climbed
a
brightly
lighted
staircase
into
one
of
the
ordinary
chinese
restaurants
of
the
better
sort
which
are
conducted
almost
entirely
for
americans
and
where
boston
baked
beans
are
as
likely
as
not
to
nudge
almond
cakes
on
the
bill
of
fare
and
champagne
flow
as
commonly
as
tea
they
gathered
around
one
of
the
larger
of
the
cheaply
inlaid
tables
and
baskinelli
took
command
of
the
feast
harry
sat
in
grim
silence
watching
pauline
like
a
protecting
dragon
lucille
was
sick
at
heart
and
repentant
of
coming
the
others
chatted
merrily
among
themselves
but
by
common
consent
pauline
seemed
to
have
been
surrendered
to
the
attentions
of
the
evening
pest
who
had
become
a
midnight
host
he
leaned
toward
her
with
an
ardor
that
he
did
not
even
attempt
to
disguise
you
are
the
most
wonderful
woman
in
please
make
it
the
universe
pleaded
pauline
there
are
so
many
most
wonderful
women
in
the
world
no
let
us
say
chaos
he
whispered
the
chaos
of
a
man
heart
can
be
ruled
only
by
the
charming
uncertainty
of
woman
the
intensity
of
his
words
brought
to
pauline
again
the
twinge
of
alarm
unconsciously
she
looked
around
for
harry
it
was
the
last
thing
in
the
world
she
had
meant
to
do
she
was
angry
at
herself
in
an
instant
for
his
fixed
guarding
gaze
was
upon
her
she
met
his
eyes
and
turned
quickly
to
baskinelli
chaos
i
always
loved
that
word
she
flashed
there
must
be
so
many
lovely
adventures
where
there
are
no
laws
i
said
the
chaos
in
a
man
heart
could
be
ruled
by
a
woman
said
baskinelli
the
impudence
of
this
sudden
love
making
moved
her
unexpectedly
to
defiance
please
let
it
be
ruled
signor
baskinelli
she
said
turning
away
from
him
baskinelli
had
sense
enough
to
see
that
he
had
gone
too
far
he
turned
to
the
others
as
the
orientals
began
to
spread
the
mixed
and
mysterious
viands
on
the
table
he
glanced
at
owen
by
the
slightest
movement
imaginable
by
the
least
uplift
of
his
black
brows
owen
answered
for
the
first
time
baskinelli
knew
that
the
lovely
quarry
he
pursued
had
a
protector
and
no
mean
no
weak
protector
but
the
arrival
of
the
repast
quickly
covered
the
general
embarrassment
everybody
could
see
that
pauline
and
harry
had
had
a
quarrel
and
that
pauline
was
flirting
outrageously
with
baskenelli
simply
for
revenge
that
is
every
one
except
harry
could
see
it
pardon
me
but
is
that
what
you
call
a
graft
investigation
that
you
are
making
miss
hamlin
inquired
baskinelli
no
but
the
food
is
so
funny
there
are
so
many
queer
things
present
but
unidentified
laughed
lucille
like
a
reception
to
a
foreign
artist
interrupted
harry
with
a
vindictive
glare
or
shall
we
say
like
the
conversation
of
an
unhappy
guest
said
baskinelli
smilingly
turning
to
note
the
entrance
of
a
little
party
of
newcomers
at
the
further
end
of
the
restaurant
a
dashing
foreigner
the
tips
of
whose
waxed
mustachios
turned
up
like
black
stalagmites
from
the
comers
of
his
cavernous
mouth
was
accompanied
by
two
nondescript
figures
who
seemed
to
be
embarrassed
more
by
the
fact
that
they
had
been
recently
cleansed
and
shaved
than
by
their
rough
red
shirts
and
mismatched
coats
and
trousers
the
man
of
the
tilted
mustachios
gave
brief
imperative
orders
to
the
waiters
whose
languid
steps
seemed
to
be
quickened
by
his
words
as
by
an
electric
battery
the
other
two
sat
silent
like
docile
dogs
in
leash
only
for
an
instant
baskinelli
eyes
rested
upon
the
group
and
having
tasted
the
food
of
the
gods
how
would
you
like
to
visit
the
gods
themselves
he
asked
pauline
agreed
enthusiastically
you
mean
a
joss
house
a
chinese
church
do
you
yes
the
joss
house
that
most
visitors
see
in
chinatown
is
the
little
one
up
under
the
roof
at
the
meeting
of
doyers
and
pell
streets
at
the
toe
of
the
twisted
horseshoe
made
by
these
tiny
thoroughfares
of
black
fame
where
in
spite
of
all
the
modern
magic
of
reform
men
still
die
silently
in
the
hush
of
secluded
corridors
and
women
vanish
into
the
darkness
that
is
worse
than
death
the
little
joss
house
is
interesting
in
the
same
way
that
an
indian
village
at
a
state
fair
is
interesting
behind
its
gaudy
staginess
and
commercial
appeal
it
still
holds
something
of
reality
from
which
the
imagination
can
draw
a
picture
of
an
ancient
worship
that
has
held
a
race
of
millions
in
thrall
for
thousands
of
years
but
it
was
not
to
the
little
joss
house
that
signor
baskinelli
guided
the
party
in
the
little
joss
house
the
bells
are
pounded
without
respite
the
visitors
come
and
go
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
save
the
few
set
hours
when
the
joss
sacrifices
profit
to
true
prayer
baskinelli
took
his
guests
to
the
joss
house
of
the
golden
screens
save
for
its
greater
size
and
more
splendid
accoutrement
it
was
little
different
from
the
other
but
it
was
walled
in
its
back
alley
seclusion
deep
behind
the
outer
fronts
of
mott
street
by
a
secrecy
almost
sincerely
sacred
the
motor
cars
remained
far
behind
across
the
square
as
baskinelli
led
the
party
through
the
dismal
streets
and
stopped
before
a
dark
doorway
a
dim
light
flared
behind
the
door
and
a
chinaman
in
american
dress
admitted
them
i
am
beginning
to
be
really
bored
said
pauline
wait
give
the
wicked
a
chance
said
baskinelli
they
climbed
three
flights
of
dingy
narrow
stairs
lighted
with
flaring
gas
jets
wonderful
jeered
pauline
not
even
a
secret
passage
or
a
subterranean
den
the
others
followed
her
laughing
lead
up
the
stairs
a
chinaman
came
out
of
the
door
on
the
second
landing
stopped
started
in
innocent
curiosity
at
the
dazzling
visitors
and
went
down
the
stairs
everything
was
as
still
and
commonplace
as
if
they
had
been
in
the
hallway
of
a
harlem
flat
building
the
silence
was
not
broken
or
the
seeming
safety
disturbed
in
the
slightest
by
the
soft
opening
of
the
first
landing
door
after
they
had
passed
that
is
after
all
but
owen
had
passed
no
one
but
owen
saw
the
piercing
black
eyes
and
the
tilted
mustachios
of
the
face
that
appeared
for
an
instant
at
the
door
there
was
a
corridor
not
so
well
lighted
at
the
top
of
the
third
flight
of
stairs
in
the
dim
turns
the
women
drew
their
skirts
about
them
a
bit
wary
of
the
black
short
walls
the
passage
narrowed
they
could
move
now
only
in
single
file
and
even
then
their
shoulders
brushed
the
walls
only
a
far
dull
glow
from
a
red
lamp
over
a
door
at
the
end
of
a
passage
lighted
their
way
baskinelli
tapped
lightly
on
the
door
it
was
opened
by
a
venerable
chinaman
in
the
flowing
robes
of
a
priest
he
looked
at
them
doubtfully
baskinelli
spoke
three
words
that
his
companions
did
not
hear
the
priest
vanished
quickly
the
door
was
reopened
and
they
stepped
into
the
dim
smoky
stifling
presence
of
the
joss
the
choking
scent
of
the
punk
always
at
the
folded
feet
of
the
idol
was
almost
suffocating
the
place
had
other
odors
less
noxious
and
less
sweet
chinamen
were
lounging
in
the
room
as
if
it
had
been
a
place
of
rest
three
priests
were
on
their
knees
before
the
joss
swaying
forward
till
their
foreheads
almost
touched
the
floor
their
outstretched
arms
moving
in
mystic
symmetry
with
their
rocking
bodies
a
great
brass
bell
hung
low
beside
the
idol
but
no
priest
touched
the
bell
the
joss
itself
was
almost
the
least
impressive
thing
in
the
room
it
stood
or
squatted
six
feet
high
on
a
block
pedestal
at
the
side
of
the
room
the
simple
hideousness
of
the
painted
features
served
no
impressive
purpose
but
as
contrast
to
the
exquisite
decorations
of
the
room
screens
of
carved
wood
so
delicately
wrought
that
it
seemed
a
touch
would
break
the
graven
fibers
were
flecked
with
inlay
of
pearl
and
covering
of
gold
one
of
the
peculiar
features
of
the
room
was
a
suit
of
ancient
chinese
armor
a
relic
that
had
been
rusted
and
by
time
but
now
stood
brightly
polished
beside
the
statue
of
the
god
a
huge
sword
was
held
upright
in
the
steel
glove
by
the
dim
light
behind
the
idol
the
shadow
of
the
sword
was
cast
across
the
blank
face
of
baskinelli
as
he
moved
forward
he
stepped
back
quickly
the
shadow
fell
between
him
and
pauline
again
the
ancient
priest
answered
a
summons
at
the
door
again
he
parleyed
for
a
moment
then
opened
it
to
the
three
swarthy
foreigners
who
had
been
in
the
restaurant
baskinelli
turned
for
just
in
instant
to
glance
at
the
tall
man
with
the
tilted
mustache
then
resumed
immediately
his
conversation
with
pauline
why
do
all
the
chinamen
run
away
like
that
she
asked
it
is
the
end
of
the
service
you
see
the
priests
are
going
too
there
was
a
furtive
haste
about
the
departure
of
the
orientals
and
there
was
a
quavering
in
the
manner
of
the
oldest
priest
the
only
one
who
remained
that
seemed
born
of
a
hidden
fear
the
old
priest
lifted
one
of
the
lamps
from
a
wall
bracket
and
set
it
on
the
floor
beside
the
idol
he
knelt
near
it
and
began
to
pray
the
three
italians
waited
only
a
moment
then
followed
the
chinese
out
of
the
room
it
is
late
we
ought
to
be
going
pleaded
lucille
complete
silence
had
fallen
on
the
room
and
her
words
a
little
tremulous
had
instant
effect
on
the
other
women
what
about
it
baskinelli
had
we
better
be
going
asked
one
of
the
men
yes
yes
i
beg
only
a
moment
i
wish
to
show
miss
pauline
the
you
mean
miss
marvin
do
you
not
blazed
harry
striding
to
baskinelli
side
and
glaring
down
at
him
i
was
interrupted
i
had
not
finished
my
words
they
are
at
best
awkward
i
beg
you
beg
nothing
said
harry
through
clenched
teeth
then
slowly
grimly
i
want
to
tell
you
you
little
leper
that
if
anything
happens
here
tonight
it
is
going
to
happen
to
you
he
was
so
near
to
the
musician
that
the
others
did
not
hear
baskinelli
backed
away
pauline
with
the
swift
inexplicable
yet
unerring
instinct
of
woman
moved
as
if
to
seek
the
shelter
of
towering
frame
he
did
not
see
her
he
had
whirled
at
the
sound
of
the
opening
of
a
door
a
peculiar
door
set
diagonally
across
a
corner
of
the
room
behind
the
joss
through
the
yellow
silk
curtains
that
hid
the
entrance
came
two
chinamen
as
fantastically
hideous
as
the
embroidered
dragons
on
the
tapestry
put
those
men
out
they
can
not
come
in
here
they
are
full
of
opium
commanded
baskinelli
stop
let
them
come
in
we
are
going
said
the
mild
voice
of
owen
the
understanding
look
of
baskinelli
met
his
baskinelli
frowned
and
owen
smiled
they
were
playing
perfectly
their
roles
the
two
chinamen
shuffled
into
the
room
the
priest
arose
in
jabbering
protest
they
argued
with
him
acridly
a
few
feet
away
one
could
see
that
their
cheap
linen
robes
covered
the
ordinary
street
garb
of
the
chinamen
that
the
ugly
lines
on
their
faces
were
painted
as
on
the
face
of
the
joss
baskinelli
was
laughing
the
others
watched
the
argument
in
silence
every
one
but
the
host
and
owen
and
pauline
seemed
a
little
nervous
suddenly
the
lamp
on
the
floor
went
out
there
was
another
at
the
farther
side
of
the
room
but
its
dim
light
made
the
scene
more
weird
than
darkness
could
have
made
it
well
i
thought
we
were
going
snapped
harry
strident
voice
we
are
replied
baskinelli
miss
er
i
am
afraid
to
speak
miss
marvin
shall
we
go
pauline
took
his
arm
ali
but
i
have
forgotten
the
most
precious
sight
of
the
evening
suddenly
exclaimed
the
musician
only
a
moment
look
here
interested
pauline
did
not
notice
that
owen
softly
shut
the
door
upon
the
receding
footsteps
of
the
others
baskinelli
guided
her
back
to
the
little
door
behind
the
screen
the
door
from
which
the
chinamen
had
entered
baskinelli
drew
aside
the
curtain
there
that
is
one
form
of
adventure
pauline
looked
through
the
curtain
a
suffocating
narcotic
odor
came
to
her
what
she
saw
was
stifling
not
only
to
the
senses
but
to
the
soul
she
turned
away
polly
harry
voice
rang
through
the
little
choked
room
like
a
thunder
blast
we
are
coming
we
are
quite
safe
called
baskinelli
with
the
sneer
tinge
in
his
tone
very
well
then
hurry
harry
manner
aroused
pauline
temper
again
she
purposely
lingered
the
two
chinamen
were
arguing
violently
now
with
the
priest
harry
had
closed
the
door
and
followed
the
others
down
the
outer
passage
miss
marvin
pauline
called
baskinelli
with
sudden
passion
have
you
a
heart
of
stone
can
you
not
see
me
helpless
in
your
presence
do
you
know
what
love
is
he
stepped
towards
her
and
tried
to
take
her
in
his
arms
but
she
was
stronger
and
far
braver
than
he
she
thrust
him
aside
and
fled
through
the
door
baskinelli
followed
protesting
pleading
strangely
as
she
fled
through
the
narrow
corridor
the
low
flaring
gas
jets
were
extinguished
one
by
one
she
groped
in
darkness
baskinelli
pleading
voice
became
almost
a
consolation
a
protection
her
elbow
struck
something
in
the
passageway
the
something
shrank
at
the
touch
she
heard
a
quick
drawn
breath
that
was
not
baskinelli
she
tried
to
run
the
tiny
passageway
chocked
her
flight
she
plunged
helplessly
between
invisible
but
gripping
walls
she
reeled
and
screamed
there
was
the
sound
of
a
struggle
behind
her
she
heard
baskinelli
crying
for
help
but
oh
so
quietly
she
reached
the
stairs
the
stairs
were
blocked
by
a
closed
door
the
door
was
barred
but
there
was
a
light
left
burning
by
the
door
her
weak
hands
beat
upon
the
panels
helplessly
hopelessly
how
should
she
know
that
there
were
two
doors
locked
and
sealed
beyond
her
wild
screams
rang
through
the
long
passage
through
the
dark
above
the
shuffle
and
beat
and
cursing
of
the
staged
fight
in
the
dim
light
she
could
see
the
three
italians
grappling
with
the
other
men
baskinelli
voice
called
to
her
reassuringly
it
might
well
baskinelli
was
in
no
danger
she
placed
her
softly
clothed
shoulder
to
the
door
and
strove
to
break
it
she
screamed
again
harry
harry
dull
crashes
answered
there
was
the
crack
and
cleaving
of
splintered
wood
hold
on
i
here
she
heard
she
fell
beside
the
door
strong
arms
seized
her
for
an
instant
she
felt
that
she
was
saved
but
she
looked
up
into
the
lowering
face
of
a
man
with
tilted
mustachios
from
the
wide
thick
lips
came
threats
and
curses
from
the
outer
passageway
sounded
the
crashing
of
the
doors
she
let
herself
be
lifted
then
with
sudden
exertion
of
her
trained
strength
she
broke
the
grasp
of
the
man
the
door
fell
open
harry
bloody
and
tattered
stood
there
alone
polly
oh
yes
where
are
the
others
they
kill
you
run
she
cried
he
ran
forward
into
the
black
corridor
a
knife
thrust
sheathed
in
silence
ripped
his
shoulder
gave
him
his
cue
he
had
one
man
down
and
trampled
but
another
was
upon
him
and
yet
a
third
a
sharp
pain
dulled
the
pulsing
of
his
throat
he
felt
a
tickle
down
his
bared
and
swinging
arm
he
fought
blindly
in
the
dark
polly
he
panted
there
was
no
answer
in
the
joss
house
of
the
golden
screens
the
two
chinamen
dazed
with
opium
set
of
purpose
were
still
arguing
with
the
trembling
priest
the
door
fell
open
and
a
white
woman
with
bleeding
hands
fell
at
their
feet
ha
she
has
come
back
cried
one
of
the
chinese
in
his
own
tongue
there
was
the
sound
of
steps
in
the
outer
passage
quick
inside
breathed
the
chinaman
pointing
to
the
den
they
lifted
pauline
the
old
priest
stopped
them
not
there
not
there
he
cried
any
one
would
look
in
there
they
dragged
her
back
the
priest
hurried
to
the
outer
door
and
locked
it
there
was
the
blunt
battering
thrust
of
a
body
against
the
door
open
or
i
break
it
in
yelled
the
voice
of
harry
the
priest
opened
the
door
in
deferential
silence
he
saluted
the
battle
grimed
newcomer
battered
panting
bleeding
harry
lunged
at
the
man
gripped
him
quick
where
is
she
you
die
like
a
spiked
rat
where
he
roared
the
two
other
chinamen
were
kneeling
before
the
joss
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
a
strange
sound
like
a
cry
heard
afar
off
harry
strode
to
the
little
pedestal
where
the
suit
of
armor
stood
where
is
she
or
i
rip
this
place
to
cockles
he
thundered
we
do
not
know
what
you
mean
said
the
priest
the
two
chinamen
began
to
jabber
other
figures
reeled
from
the
room
behind
the
curtains
but
over
all
their
clamor
sounded
again
the
faint
cry
distant
but
near
in
a
flash
harry
caught
from
the
mailed
glove
the
haft
of
the
sword
as
he
rushed
across
the
room
the
chinese
withered
away
from
him
there
was
a
crash
as
the
great
sword
fell
upon
one
of
the
windows
through
the
broken
pane
harry
shouted
for
help
his
voice
was
like
a
clarion
in
the
silent
streets
he
turned
in
time
three
chinamen
with
drawn
knives
were
upon
him
he
swung
the
unwieldy
sword
above
his
head
its
sweep
saved
him
he
dashed
at
the
joss
again
he
lifted
the
sword
a
grasp
and
then
a
wail
of
fear
sounded
through
the
room
he
struck
the
head
of
the
statue
thudded
to
the
floor
the
chinese
rushed
upon
him
they
were
desperate
now
in
the
face
of
the
violation
of
their
god
but
he
was
behind
their
god
prying
open
the
secret
door
to
the
hollow
within
the
statue
it
all
right
polly
he
said
as
he
drew
her
gently
forth
he
stood
above
her
with
his
back
to
the
wall
swinging
the
sacred
sword
against
the
onslaught
of
fanatic
men
they
fell
before
him
but
more
came
on
his
hands
could
hardly
hold
the
mighty
weapon
for
more
than
half
an
hour
he
had
been
fighting
he
was
weakening
but
he
braced
himself
and
swung
for
the
last
time
there
came
a
hammering
at
the
door
it
crashed
in
police
clubs
whistled
right
and
left
the
chinese
fled
into
their
secret
lairs
and
i
guess
that
will
be
all
panted
harry
in
the
taxi
that
took
them
home
i
do
think
you
ask
for
any
more
adventures
after
this
one
why
did
you
pick
up
the
joss
head
replied
pauline
it
would
have
looked
so
nice
and
dreadful
in
the
library
but
the
glory
of
her
golden
hair
nestled
upon
his
torn
shoulder
and
he
knew
that
he
would
go
through
all
the
perils
in
the
world
for
happiness
like
this
chapter
x
kaboff
wild
horse
for
several
months
after
old
marvin
death
owen
had
kept
to
his
room
adjoining
the
financier
small
workaday
office
but
recently
he
had
got
the
habit
of
doing
his
work
in
the
library
where
the
tall
pure
statues
looked
down
upon
his
skulking
head
and
the
grand
old
books
that
had
borne
their
messages
of
good
from
generation
to
generation
held
their
high
thoughts
in
stately
contrast
to
his
skilled
and
cruel
plots
above
the
bowed
bald
head
that
was
planning
the
death
of
a
young
girl
to
gain
her
fortune
stood
a
figure
of
of
innocence
and
sunlight
shadowed
by
black
robes
of
dis
upon
the
coward
who
feared
all
but
the
darkest
and
most
devious
passages
of
crime
shone
high
clear
brows
of
caesar
and
aurelius
gray
folios
of
shakespeare
held
up
to
the
ambitious
ingrate
the
warning
titles
of
lear
and
hamlet
and
macbeth
and
by
his
side
brooded
ever
that
mystic
relic
of
the
farther
past
the
mummy
from
whose
case
had
stepped
a
daughter
of
the
pharaohs
in
the
likeness
of
pauline
but
owen
thought
little
of
contrasts
he
was
opening
his
mail
on
a
morning
in
early
may
when
he
came
across
an
envelope
addressed
in
the
awkward
scrawl
of
hicks
he
tore
it
apart
nervously
for
if
hicks
could
be
moved
to
write
it
must
be
a
matter
of
concern
dear
owen
no
doubt
he
suspects
you
of
foul
play
he
has
seen
his
attorneys
and
is
about
to
take
steps
to
have
you
removed
from
the
the
paper
crackled
in
owen
trembling
hand
so
the
baskinelli
incident
had
gone
a
little
too
far
harry
marvin
had
sense
enough
to
know
that
he
would
not
have
to
fight
three
murderous
italians
and
a
rabble
of
chinese
unless
there
had
been
a
plot
behind
pauline
peril
it
might
be
best
to
go
directly
after
harry
to
put
him
out
of
the
way
first
and
yet
owen
pondered
there
was
no
proof
of
anything
wrong
pauline
was
admittedly
plunging
into
these
adventures
of
her
own
free
will
nothing
could
be
proved
against
him
or
hicks
he
resumed
his
work
among
the
letters
lay
an
advertising
dodger
which
had
been
dropped
through
the
door
owen
glanced
at
it
carelessly
at
first
then
with
keen
interest
he
read
it
over
balloon
ascension
from
palisades
signor
panatella
the
famous
italian
aeronaut
will
make
parachute
drop
from
height
never
before
attempted
the
ascension
was
to
be
made
that
afternoon
from
one
of
the
amusement
parks
on
the
new
jersey
shore
of
the
hudson
this
is
providence
he
muttered
to
himself
catching
up
the
dodger
slipping
through
the
door
and
up
the
stairs
he
tapped
at
the
door
of
pauline
room
when
there
came
no
answer
he
entered
swiftly
laid
a
paper
on
the
table
and
glided
back
to
the
hall
back
to
the
library
from
there
he
called
up
hicks
hicks
domiciles
were
so
many
and
suddenly
changeable
that
he
claimed
nothing
so
dignified
as
a
regular
telephone
number
but
he
had
scribbled
on
the
bottom
of
his
note
the
number
of
a
saloon
on
the
lower
west
side
he
was
there
when
owen
rang
hello
hello
is
that
you
hicks
i
want
to
see
you
what
no
right
away
broke
you
always
are
you
get
the
cash
all
right
what
that
come
here
not
on
your
life
i
come
to
you
not
half
that
time
i
take
the
motorcycle
all
right
he
hung
up
the
receiver
went
up
to
his
room
and
got
into
cycling
kit
as
he
came
down
stairs
he
met
pauline
who
was
returning
from
a
shopping
trip
good
morning
owen
she
said
brightly
do
you
know
i
believe
there
is
more
peril
in
a
dry
goods
store
than
on
a
pirate
yacht
what
parts
of
my
new
hat
are
left
only
the
becoming
ones
she
sped
on
up
the
stairs
after
her
first
imperative
inquiries
of
the
mirror
concerning
what
she
considered
her
wild
appearance
she
picked
up
the
letters
on
her
dressing
table
and
began
to
run
through
them
the
large
black
type
of
an
advertising
dodger
loomed
among
the
letters
pauline
tripped
down
the
stairs
to
harry
seated
on
the
steps
enjoying
the
spring
sunshine
and
puffing
a
leisurely
cigarette
appeared
a
mysterious
vision
he
knew
by
the
elaborate
way
in
which
she
took
her
seat
beside
him
and
hid
the
piece
of
paper
in
her
hand
that
she
had
some
new
whim
in
fermentation
something
to
ask
him
that
she
knew
he
would
want
to
do
yes
he
said
moving
along
the
step
away
from
her
i
know
just
bought
me
the
loveliest
cravat
that
i
the
nicest
brother
in
the
world
that
i
look
so
handsome
in
springy
things
and
well
what
it
is
pauline
pouted
at
the
other
end
of
the
step
i
going
up
in
a
balloon
and
jump
down
she
announced
from
a
height
never
before
attempted
polly
i
you
are
going
to
do
nothing
of
the
no
i
was
going
to
until
you
grew
so
great
and
grand
i
just
wanted
to
go
over
and
see
him
fly
she
tossed
the
dodger
over
to
him
he
glanced
at
it
well
if
you
promise
you
are
plotting
any
more
pranks
i
take
you
that
a
brother
it
a
pink
one
pink
one
cravat
of
course
harry
groaned
give
it
to
the
cook
he
pleaded
he
wears
alive
if
that
fellow
goes
up
at
you
better
hurry
i
be
ready
before
you
are
she
rose
quickly
but
owen
looking
listening
had
time
to
close
the
door
unseen
unheard
at
the
rear
of
a
little
west
side
saloon
he
signaled
with
his
horn
and
hicks
came
out
he
was
a
bit
shabbier
than
usual
and
he
had
been
drinking
but
he
was
not
intoxicated
owen
locked
his
machine
and
taking
his
arm
walked
him
rapidly
up
the
avenue
what
do
you
mean
by
writing
to
me
demanded
owen
have
i
told
you
never
to
put
words
on
paper
oh
i
guess
you
got
that
house
wired
so
nobody
catch
you
grunted
hicks
live
wires
butlers
footmen
maids
chauffeurs
cooks
you
safe
enough
you
forget
those
are
your
wires
they
do
know
they
working
for
me
hicks
are
you
out
of
your
head
have
you
told
bemis
that
you
and
i
are
working
together
sure
not
but
that
butler
is
no
fool
mr
owen
was
it
from
him
you
found
out
that
harry
had
the
lawyers
after
us
no
queer
thing
that
that
it
was
who
then
the
little
espinosa
espinosa
in
new
york
yes
met
her
at
the
trocadero
a
week
ago
she
seen
old
calderwood
already
i
guess
she
blackmails
him
the
old
reprobate
and
him
the
noble
counselor
at
law
for
harry
marvin
so
you
put
her
on
the
scent
for
us
why
not
the
young
fellow
been
acting
suspicious
for
a
long
time
you
did
very
well
how
about
some
money
i
have
seen
the
color
of
a
roll
since
you
put
that
fool
baskinelli
into
the
game
ai
you
coming
across
certainly
here
said
owen
handing
over
enough
to
sate
even
the
predatory
greed
of
hicks
now
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
find
me
some
one
among
your
horse
racing
friends
who
is
down
and
out
enough
to
take
a
little
cash
job
at
certain
slight
risks
yes
what
i
want
a
good
rider
on
a
wild
horse
he
could
make
a
thousand
dollars
in
an
afternoon
if
the
horse
should
happen
to
get
wild
at
the
right
time
and
do
the
right
thing
hm
mused
hicks
i
wonder
if
eddie
kaboff
has
still
got
his
livery
stable
down
on
tenth
avenue
we
might
go
see
after
ten
minutes
walk
hicks
brought
up
in
front
of
a
door
in
a
fence
he
held
it
open
for
owen
and
they
passed
across
a
vacant
lot
to
a
large
stable
at
the
further
end
the
short
dark
man
who
sat
in
a
tilted
chair
against
the
doorway
and
puffed
lazily
at
a
pipe
seemed
to
embody
the
spirit
of
the
building
and
the
business
done
there
he
was
a
man
who
had
once
in
the
days
of
racing
been
called
a
sport
he
might
still
be
called
horsey
and
would
consider
the
term
a
compliment
but
eddie
kaboff
fame
and
fortune
had
both
dwindled
since
the
good
old
betting
days
when
little
swindling
games
larded
the
solid
profits
of
crooked
races
one
by
one
his
thoroughbreds
had
given
up
their
stalls
to
truck
horses
just
as
eddie
diamond
studs
had
given
place
to
plain
buttons
his
beady
black
eyes
watched
the
two
newcomers
on
their
way
across
the
lot
but
he
gave
no
sign
of
recognition
until
hicks
and
owen
reached
the
door
hello
eddie
said
hicks
kaboff
got
up
slowly
and
extended
a
flabby
hand
to
his
acquaintance
he
was
introduced
to
owen
who
let
hicks
do
the
talking
what
new
eddie
nuthin
still
got
that
wild
horse
you
never
was
able
to
sell
yep
can
you
still
manage
him
yourself
i
guess
i
could
but
he
ai
safe
to
take
among
traffic
hicks
stepped
close
to
kaboff
talking
in
rapid
whispers
the
little
man
turned
white
no
no
i
too
old
for
that
kind
of
game
he
said
owen
drew
from
his
pocket
a
roll
of
yellowbacks
the
biggest
roll
eddie
kaboff
had
seen
since
the
days
of
easy
money
this
much
to
try
it
said
owen
and
as
much
again
if
you
make
good
kaboff
glance
wavered
a
moment
between
the
penetrating
eyes
of
owen
and
the
money
in
his
hand
take
it
it
yours
the
flabby
hand
closed
almost
caressingly
around
the
roll
we
go
in
and
have
a
look
at
the
brute
he
said
they
followed
him
through
a
line
of
stalls
to
a
large
padded
box
at
the
far
end
of
the
barn
a
beautiful
bay
saddle
horse
occupied
the
box
kaboff
entered
and
called
the
animal
which
answered
by
flying
into
a
seeming
fury
plunging
about
the
box
kicking
rearing
and
snapping
same
old
devil
muttered
hicks
he
do
the
sight
of
an
apple
in
kaboff
hand
calmed
the
animal
it
came
to
him
and
ate
docilely
while
he
slipped
a
bridle
over
its
head
once
outside
the
stall
however
it
began
another
rampage
hicks
held
a
last
whispered
conversation
with
kaboff
giving
him
minute
instructions
i
can
just
try
it
you
know
said
kaboff
i
ca
guarantee
to
get
away
with
it
as
much
again
if
you
do
you
know
said
owen
as
he
started
briskly
away
with
hicks
the
place
that
panatella
had
chosen
for
the
start
of
his
balloon
ascension
was
a
field
upon
the
crest
of
the
palisades
above
the
amusement
park
panatella
had
brought
with
him
from
abroad
a
reputation
for
adventures
in
the
air
and
he
had
proved
his
reckless
courage
in
the
several
brief
ascensions
that
he
had
already
made
on
this
side
today
with
his
promise
of
the
longest
parachute
drop
on
record
people
flocked
to
the
field
from
new
york
and
all
adjacent
new
jersey
i
wish
you
would
always
invite
that
servant
on
our
trips
grumbled
harry
to
pauline
as
owen
went
for
his
dustcoat
owen
is
my
trustee
and
guardian
you
have
no
right
to
speak
of
him
as
a
servant
besides
when
he
along
he
keeps
you
from
being
silly
harry
stamped
out
to
the
garage
swung
a
new
touring
car
around
to
the
door
and
soon
with
owen
and
pauline
was
speeding
for
the
ferry
signor
panatella
was
superintending
the
filling
of
the
great
gas
bag
he
was
a
tall
lithe
man
in
pink
tights
beneath
which
his
muscles
bulged
angularly
like
the
gas
filling
the
balloon
bag
a
latin
rapidity
of
speech
and
motion
added
to
the
pink
tights
made
him
comically
and
even
the
abattis
of
medals
on
his
breast
could
not
save
his
dignity
he
bustled
about
giving
orders
to
the
workmen
who
were
preparing
to
cut
the
ropes
then
flitting
back
to
the
crowd
to
answer
the
questions
of
impromptu
admirers
pauline
had
left
the
car
and
was
standing
between
owen
and
harry
near
the
rapidly
filling
bag
i
wish
i
could
talk
to
him
too
he
so
cute
and
she
said
owen
stepped
to
panatella
side
would
you
permit
the
young
lady
to
see
the
balloon
basket
he
asked
with
pleasure
said
the
airman
after
a
glance
at
pauline
he
led
the
way
to
the
basket
and
helped
pauline
up
so
that
she
could
look
at
the
equipment
the
anchor
with
its
long
coil
of
rope
the
sand
bags
and
water
bottles
she
was
plainly
fascinated
as
panatella
explained
the
manner
of
his
flight
and
his
drop
through
the
air
as
she
saw
them
attach
the
basket
to
the
tugging
bag
she
was
thrilled
at
this
moment
there
was
a
flurry
of
excitement
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
a
horseman
on
a
beautiful
bay
mount
that
was
evidently
unmanageable
came
plunging
and
swerving
down
the
field
the
crowd
broke
and
scattered
in
front
of
the
menacing
hoofs
that
flew
in
the
air
as
the
vicious
animal
reared
the
horseman
clad
in
a
somewhat
threadbare
riding
suit
was
a
small
man
with
beady
black
eyes
that
turned
from
side
to
side
as
he
swayed
in
his
saddle
he
seemed
to
be
afraid
of
his
mount
and
to
be
looking
for
help
but
it
was
remarkable
that
apparently
so
poor
a
rider
held
his
seat
and
actually
managed
to
bring
the
beast
to
a
nervous
stand
some
fifty
yards
from
the
balloon
the
little
man
looked
around
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
he
caught
sight
of
owen
beside
pauline
near
the
balloon
basket
the
lifting
of
his
riding
cap
might
or
might
not
have
been
a
salute
and
signal
oh
i
wish
i
had
promised
harry
not
to
go
up
i
know
signor
panatella
would
take
me
sighed
pauline
harry
had
turned
away
to
watch
the
actions
of
the
strange
horseman
you
might
scare
him
a
little
owen
suggested
those
words
were
the
greatest
risk
he
had
taken
in
all
his
deeply
laid
plots
pauline
caught
at
the
suggestion
eagerly
she
sprang
lightly
from
the
little
platform
into
the
balloon
car
a
murmur
of
mingled
astonishment
applause
and
alarm
rose
from
the
crowd
two
of
the
workmen
were
cutting
the
last
ropes
that
held
the
basket
to
earth
ten
others
were
holding
it
with
their
hands
awaiting
the
airman
panatella
purposely
delayed
the
moment
of
mounting
the
basket
the
tugging
of
the
huge
balloon
against
the
strength
of
a
dozen
men
gave
impress
to
his
feat
and
he
liked
the
state
of
suspense
but
the
sound
from
the
surprised
throng
called
his
attention
now
to
a
scene
that
made
him
forget
affectation
and
effect
he
started
to
run
toward
the
basket
shouting
peremptory
orders
out
of
the
car
out
of
the
car
instantly
madame
you
are
risking
your
life
his
excitement
infected
the
crowd
surging
it
seemed
to
sweep
with
it
the
rider
on
the
restive
horse
for
as
a
hand
was
suddenly
lifted
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
the
horse
apparently
overcame
the
legs
braced
to
spring
it
shot
forward
directly
at
the
balloon
basket
the
hand
that
had
been
raised
was
the
hand
of
raymond
owen
all
was
happening
so
swiftly
that
neither
harry
nor
panatella
reached
the
basket
before
the
maddened
animal
the
crowd
had
given
way
in
panic
before
it
cries
of
fright
were
mingled
with
cries
of
pain
as
the
beast
charged
straight
upon
the
men
holding
the
basket
felling
and
crushing
them
with
shoulder
and
hoof
for
an
instant
a
few
desperate
hands
held
to
the
wrenching
car
panatella
had
all
but
reached
the
platform
harry
was
within
length
of
it
when
with
a
writhing
twist
the
bag
jerked
the
basket
sideways
and
upward
knocking
to
the
ground
the
last
two
men
who
had
held
it
and
whirling
forth
into
the
deathly
emptiness
of
space
a
cowering
stunned
girl
whose
white
face
peered
and
white
hands
pleaded
over
the
basket
rim
peered
down
upon
the
upturned
faces
of
thousands
who
would
have
risked
their
lives
to
aid
but
who
stood
helpless
in
their
pity
hushed
in
fear
for
a
moment
harry
had
stood
dazed
it
was
as
if
the
twanging
taut
of
the
ropes
as
the
bag
tore
almost
from
his
grasp
the
most
precious
being
in
the
world
had
snapped
the
fibers
of
action
in
him
the
daze
passed
quickly
but
in
the
moment
of
its
passing
the
balloon
risen
now
five
hundred
feet
in
the
air
had
swept
its
way
westward
over
a
mile
of
ground
harry
turned
to
look
for
his
motor
car
standing
as
he
was
at
the
spot
from
which
the
balloon
had
ascended
he
now
faced
a
human
barricade
with
a
shout
of
warning
he
charged
at
what
seemed
to
be
a
vulnerable
point
in
the
files
of
wedged
shoulders
the
wall
resisted
the
throng
was
lost
to
all
but
the
dimming
view
of
the
balloon
harry
swung
right
and
left
with
his
broad
shoulders
he
tore
his
way
through
the
car
was
standing
where
he
had
left
it
on
the
outskirts
of
the
field
as
he
approached
it
he
saw
owen
emerge
from
the
crowd
and
hurry
toward
a
runabout
that
had
just
been
driven
upon
the
field
what
the
matter
yelled
a
man
in
the
machine
and
harry
recognized
the
voice
of
hicks
miss
marvin
carried
away
in
the
balloon
cried
owen
in
a
tone
of
excitement
that
was
not
all
feigned
he
joined
hicks
beside
the
runabout
harry
sprang
to
the
seat
of
his
touring
car
it
seemed
to
leap
forward
he
shot
past
the
two
conspirators
and
heard
owen
voice
calling
after
him
wait
where
are
you
going
i
go
with
you
you
too
late
shouted
harry
bitterly
over
his
shoulder
an
envelope
of
dust
sealed
itself
around
the
spinning
wheels
of
the
big
machine
as
he
took
the
road
after
the
balloon
steadfast
but
hopeless
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
unconquerable
thing
in
its
unassailable
element
a
thing
that
seemed
to
be
fleeing
from
him
as
if
inspired
by
a
human
will
death
rode
beside
him
at
his
breakneck
speed
but
he
did
not
know
it
he
knew
only
that
he
must
follow
that
black
beacon
in
the
sky
that
he
must
be
there
when
its
flight
was
over
when
the
end
came
he
did
not
know
that
owen
and
hicks
in
the
runabout
were
also
following
that
they
too
watched
with
an
interest
as
deep
as
his
with
a
hope
as
poignant
as
his
hopelessness
the
dizzy
voyage
of
pauline
chapter
xi
from
cloud
to
cliff
wonder
what
he
thinks
he
can
do
growled
hicks
as
they
sat
in
the
runabout
and
watched
harry
pass
them
trying
to
break
his
own
neck
for
nothing
replied
owen
if
he
keeps
up
that
speed
we
get
both
birds
with
one
sand
bag
i
hope
so
he
did
speak
did
he
you
can
see
by
the
way
he
acts
he
do
want
us
around
even
now
it
does
matter
what
he
wants
it
what
he
does
you
do
think
he
can
save
her
he
might
and
i
do
want
her
saved
this
time
hicks
you
understand
i
ca
afford
it
this
time
i
said
too
much
well
where
did
you
get
this
runabout
upper
east
side
private
party
i
did
want
to
do
any
business
near
home
that
right
how
much
is
this
machine
worth
asked
owen
irrelevantly
oh
six
or
seven
hundred
it
ai
new
why
if
anything
should
happen
to
it
there
would
be
any
trouble
provided
the
bill
was
paid
would
there
i
got
an
idea
the
owner
would
grab
at
for
this
here
buggy
but
why
and
if
this
automobile
disappeared
vanished
no
trace
of
it
sure
there
would
be
any
investigation
pursued
hicks
yes
it
would
be
all
right
i
tell
you
but
i
want
to
know
what
your
scheme
is
how
can
you
use
this
machine
to
get
rid
of
harry
tell
me
owen
insisted
never
mind
yet
how
do
you
make
the
course
of
the
balloon
now
i
guess
she
go
over
quirksborough
and
then
up
between
hoxey
and
brent
then
we
can
pass
him
at
quirksborough
how
do
you
figure
that
he
stop
for
gasoline
he
has
got
enough
to
go
more
than
two
miles
beyond
there
i
saw
that
he
had
when
we
set
out
what
do
you
want
to
pass
him
for
why
not
let
both
break
their
own
merry
little
necks
an
us
pick
up
an
do
the
afterward
that
our
music
you
fool
do
you
think
a
balloon
ever
came
down
safe
yet
you
know
that
young
devil
has
got
his
head
full
of
schemes
to
beat
me
out
again
i
tell
you
we
got
to
make
sure
of
this
trick
got
to
get
him
unconsciously
hicks
brought
the
machine
to
a
stop
as
both
men
strained
their
eyes
at
the
balloon
now
traversing
a
lower
course
more
slowly
they
saw
pauline
stand
erect
in
the
basket
and
lift
the
heavy
anchor
over
the
side
harry
going
at
terrific
speed
on
the
deserted
road
saw
the
drop
of
the
anchor
with
a
thrill
of
hope
at
least
even
if
it
was
useless
in
itself
it
showed
him
that
pauline
was
brave
and
calm
enough
to
use
her
wits
he
waved
again
but
there
was
no
answering
signal
suddenly
the
balloon
itself
was
lost
to
sight
from
the
road
at
the
lowering
angle
drawn
downward
partly
by
the
anchor
and
partly
by
the
gradual
loss
of
gas
it
swung
over
the
hills
the
road
led
between
two
hills
beyond
it
curved
to
the
east
and
north
as
he
reached
the
curve
harry
was
surprised
that
the
balloon
was
not
in
sight
when
after
circling
another
hill
harry
had
still
failed
to
pick
it
up
he
was
alarmed
as
well
as
puzzled
the
hills
had
muddled
his
senses
of
direction
but
he
knew
that
he
was
near
the
river
again
back
on
the
verge
of
the
palisades
this
added
to
his
fears
there
was
but
one
thing
to
do
though
follow
the
road
he
went
on
slowly
suddenly
he
uttered
a
cry
and
threw
on
full
speed
over
the
top
of
a
high
jagged
cliff
set
like
a
rampart
between
two
bastion
knolls
he
saw
the
upper
half
of
the
gas
bag
it
veered
and
tossed
in
the
wind
like
a
tethered
thing
the
basket
was
invisible
but
harry
knew
that
the
anchor
had
caught
on
the
cliff
side
as
he
neared
it
he
discovered
that
what
was
a
cliff
on
one
side
was
the
river
wall
on
the
other
he
thanked
heaven
that
the
road
led
to
the
top
of
it
he
turned
the
machine
up
the
road
which
threaded
narrow
ledges
through
growths
of
bramble
and
stunted
trees
he
saw
and
turned
sick
in
soul
and
body
for
the
pulling
of
the
balloon
held
the
basket
almost
inverted
and
pauline
was
not
in
the
basket
the
anchor
had
doubled
itself
into
rock
or
root
far
down
the
cliff
side
from
it
the
balloon
dragged
toward
the
river
instead
of
toward
the
shore
the
taut
rope
writhed
fifty
feet
out
from
the
top
of
the
declivity
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
crawled
harry
he
moved
rapidly
but
at
the
uttermost
verge
he
paused
and
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand
at
last
he
looked
down
to
pauline
on
her
wild
flight
had
come
increasing
calm
as
she
felt
the
balloon
reaching
lower
levels
though
it
still
soared
high
above
the
hills
she
even
allowed
herself
a
little
hope
leaning
over
she
watched
the
shining
blades
of
the
anchor
dance
through
the
air
northeastward
she
could
see
the
waves
of
the
great
river
dancing
on
the
little
anchor
hung
her
hope
of
life
in
the
water
beyond
the
farthest
cliff
lay
her
final
peril
she
had
lost
track
of
harry
and
the
other
automobile
long
ago
she
had
given
up
all
hope
of
aid
from
any
living
thing
the
balloon
moved
slowly
above
the
palisade
the
anchor
dragged
on
the
landward
side
of
the
knolls
these
were
sheer
rock
that
the
steel
talons
clawed
in
vain
the
balloon
moved
out
over
the
river
then
suddenly
glided
back
an
eddy
of
breeze
from
the
water
had
turned
its
course
the
anchor
dangled
along
the
river
wall
of
the
precipice
pauline
seized
the
rope
she
alternately
pulled
and
loosened
it
trying
to
hook
the
anchor
to
tree
or
shrub
suddenly
she
was
flung
forward
almost
out
of
the
basket
the
balloon
had
stopped
with
a
jerk
hopefully
fearfully
she
pulled
in
the
rope
the
anchor
held
the
balloon
was
tugging
and
swaying
wildly
but
its
tether
did
not
break
she
looked
down
at
the
ledge
between
her
and
that
narrow
footing
the
only
thoroughfare
was
two
hundred
feet
of
swaying
rope
she
pulled
upon
the
rope
again
she
dropped
two
more
of
the
heavy
ballast
bags
over
the
side
and
the
bag
shook
and
groaned
upon
its
stays
as
it
dragged
the
anchor
deeper
into
the
rock
she
put
her
feet
over
the
edge
of
the
basket
with
her
hands
clutching
the
rim
she
lowered
herself
taking
her
hands
from
the
basket
and
grasping
the
rope
she
started
down
the
raw
hemp
tore
her
hands
the
fearful
strain
upon
her
arms
made
her
sick
and
faint
only
desperation
nerved
her
after
the
first
ten
yards
the
wrenching
of
the
balloon
whirled
and
jostled
her
at
first
holding
only
by
her
hands
she
was
flung
out
from
the
aft
halyard
like
a
flag
then
instinct
told
her
to
wrap
her
feet
around
it
and
she
trembled
on
she
looked
down
once
saw
the
far
swaying
river
and
looked
quickly
up
again
it
was
not
until
her
groping
feet
touched
the
rock
of
the
ledge
that
she
opened
her
eyes
again
at
the
top
of
a
slender
rope
whirled
and
veered
and
battled
a
balloon
with
an
empty
basket
the
sound
of
creaking
ropes
mingled
in
her
ears
with
the
chugging
of
a
motor
car
the
chugging
seemed
a
long
way
off
but
its
noise
seemed
to
make
her
dizzy
she
sank
in
a
dead
faint
upon
the
narrow
ledge
beside
the
hooked
anchor
pauline
pauline
it
i
harry
ca
you
hear
me
pauline
there
came
no
sound
in
answer
only
the
creaking
of
the
balloon
rope
in
the
air
the
rasping
of
the
anchor
fluke
upon
the
stone
he
sprang
up
and
back
to
the
motor
and
began
throwing
out
the
robes
blankets
tools
and
chains
he
laid
a
blanket
on
the
ground
and
began
to
slash
it
into
strips
with
his
pocket
knife
in
the
ends
of
the
strips
he
cut
slits
and
linked
the
slits
with
the
chains
to
form
a
rope
he
paused
only
once
in
his
frantic
labor
that
was
when
he
rushed
back
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
to
look
again
and
call
vain
he
fastened
the
chain
at
the
end
of
his
strange
line
to
a
sapling
growing
some
ten
feet
back
of
the
verge
and
with
a
throb
of
relief
saw
the
other
end
drop
to
within
a
few
feet
of
the
unconscious
girl
he
tested
the
strength
of
the
cable
by
pulling
on
it
with
all
his
might
it
did
not
give
he
put
himself
over
the
cliff
side
and
began
the
descent
owen
and
hicks
had
not
only
lost
the
balloon
but
had
lost
harry
too
they
could
follow
him
only
by
the
deep
cut
tracks
of
his
flying
car
and
these
were
as
likely
to
be
over
marshes
and
fields
as
on
the
highway
more
than
once
hicks
urged
that
they
turn
back
we
ca
do
no
good
he
argued
if
they
ai
dead
they
ai
that
all
i
got
to
be
sure
muttered
owen
the
little
runabout
had
a
hard
fight
to
climb
the
cliff
that
big
car
had
taken
so
easily
but
as
they
came
through
the
grove
into
view
of
the
balloon
and
the
empty
basket
the
two
felt
amply
rewarded
for
their
worry
and
trouble
and
toil
by
george
it
has
happened
it
done
cried
owen
no
artist
gazing
on
a
finished
masterpiece
no
conqueror
thanking
the
fates
for
victory
could
have
spoken
with
more
triumphant
fervor
but
hicks
was
out
of
the
machine
and
running
to
harry
car
he
saw
the
shreds
of
the
blankets
he
saw
the
knife
finally
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
chain
that
was
fastened
to
the
sapling
do
be
so
sure
grumbled
hicks
come
on
but
come
quiet
he
got
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
crawled
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
owen
followed
him
together
they
drew
back
with
gasps
of
surprise
and
anger
hicks
sprang
to
his
feet
his
knife
flashed
in
his
hand
he
sawed
excitedly
at
the
small
chain
a
low
curse
escaped
him
as
the
blade
bent
on
the
links
owen
had
dashed
to
harry
auto
he
was
back
with
a
pair
of
heavy
pliers
in
a
flash
he
had
cut
the
chain
the
end
of
it
shot
over
the
cliff
there
was
a
startled
cry
from
below
it
was
several
minutes
before
hicks
and
owen
looked
down
again
the
man
they
thought
they
had
just
killed
and
the
girl
whom
they
had
marked
to
die
stood
on
the
ledge
in
each
other
arms
oblivious
of
life
or
death
or
foe
or
friend
of
everything
but
love
pauline
was
still
aquiver
with
the
shock
of
her
waking
a
cry
ringing
above
her
had
brought
her
from
her
swoon
and
she
had
looked
up
to
see
the
terrible
balloon
still
reeling
over
her
and
to
find
harry
dangling
from
a
rope
end
not
ten
feet
away
she
rose
weakly
and
stretched
out
her
arms
to
him
be
still
do
move
dear
he
called
softly
you
ca
help
me
you
there
was
a
sudden
snapping
sound
from
over
the
top
of
the
cliff
the
chain
end
of
the
line
fell
upon
his
shoulders
he
dropped
joltingly
to
the
ledge
and
lunged
forward
toward
a
further
fall
it
was
the
soft
arms
of
pauline
that
caught
and
held
him
both
trembling
a
little
as
their
lips
met
from
overhead
came
the
sound
of
a
starting
automobile
harry
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
there
was
no
answer
he
stopped
quickly
and
picked
up
the
severed
end
of
the
life
line
look
it
was
broken
it
was
cut
he
cried
good
heaven
polly
who
is
it
that
hates
us
like
that
for
answer
she
merely
nestled
nearer
in
his
protecting
arms
they
sat
down
on
the
ledge
and
harry
keen
eyes
watched
the
tantrums
of
the
balloon
in
the
wind
it
was
pulling
fiercely
toward
the
river
now
but
the
anchor
held
fast
suddenly
harry
sprang
up
pauline
started
to
follow
his
example
but
he
motioned
her
to
stay
where
she
was
in
his
hand
gleamed
the
revolver
that
he
had
carried
ever
since
the
battle
in
den
who
is
it
whispered
pauline
can
you
see
some
one
he
raised
the
revolver
in
the
air
took
aim
and
fired
the
balloon
rope
at
his
feet
suddenly
slacked
and
he
caught
at
its
sagging
loop
to
gave
the
anchor
from
loosening
he
fired
twice
again
at
the
balloon
bag
and
pauline
clinging
to
his
shoulder
saw
the
monster
that
had
held
her
a
slave
to
its
elemental
power
that
like
some
winged
gorgon
had
held
her
captive
in
the
labyrinth
of
air
crumple
and
wither
and
fall
at
the
prick
of
a
bullet
saw
it
collapse
into
a
mass
of
tangled
leather
and
rope
and
slide
in
final
ruin
down
the
smooth
cliff
she
looked
at
harry
with
the
whimsical
smile
that
she
could
not
suppress
even
on
the
dizzy
heights
of
danger
did
you
really
think
i
would
fly
away
again
she
asked
hopeless
ward
he
said
pitiful
case
miss
pauline
marvin
crazy
heiress
thinks
she
funny
when
she
merely
getting
killed
no
miss
flippancy
i
wanted
a
line
to
slide
the
rest
of
the
way
on
he
announced
as
he
gave
the
anchor
rope
a
twist
around
a
rock
pauline
merriment
vanished
like
a
flash
oh
i
ca
do
it
again
harry
i
ca
she
cried
tremulously
it
will
be
easy
this
time
he
told
her
here
give
me
your
hands
with
a
piece
of
the
blanket
rope
he
tied
her
wrists
together
and
placed
her
arms
about
his
shoulders
grasping
a
rope
that
sagged
away
to
the
wrecked
balloon
on
the
road
far
below
he
placed
a
leg
over
the
ledge
wrapped
it
around
the
rope
and
bracing
the
other
foot
against
the
rock
wall
started
joyously
on
his
fearful
task
joyously
for
if
ever
man
rejoiced
at
the
gates
of
death
it
was
harry
marvin
to
him
the
chance
to
risk
his
life
today
was
a
blessing
and
a
boon
it
was
what
he
had
prayed
for
hopelessly
on
the
long
motor
dash
in
the
wake
of
the
balloon
just
the
chance
to
try
and
save
her
to
die
with
her
was
all
he
asked
to
die
fighting
for
her
was
all
he
wanted
and
here
he
was
holding
her
in
his
arms
on
a
stout
rope
already
half
way
down
the
cliff
at
the
bottom
he
let
her
feel
the
firm
earth
once
more
now
you
can
open
your
eyes
he
said
with
his
torn
hands
he
started
to
lift
her
arms
from
his
neck
but
she
clung
there
weeping
oh
harry
you
are
so
patient
so
good
and
brave
and
i
have
made
you
risk
your
life
again
for
me
sure
that
it
worry
about
me
now
he
grumbled
although
he
held
her
tenderly
and
close
when
will
you
find
out
that
my
life
matter
it
yours
that
counts
i
will
never
never
do
it
again
said
pauline
like
a
naughty
child
you
used
to
say
that
when
you
were
four
years
old
it
was
usually
a
lie
said
harry
i
love
you
said
pauline
irrelevantly
then
me
he
demanded
because
she
stopped
steps
sounded
from
the
roadway
they
peered
through
the
thicket
that
concealed
them
and
saw
owen
approaching
pauline
hailed
him
he
turned
toward
the
thicket
in
obsequious
haste
thank
heaven
miss
marvin
he
cried
it
must
be
a
miracle
and
you
are
safe
too
he
added
turning
to
harry
how
did
you
know
i
was
ever
in
danger
inquired
harry
grimly
we
heard
shots
explained
owen
we
saw
the
balloon
fall
and
we
knew
what
you
had
done
it
was
magnificent
i
congratulate
you
congratulate
polly
said
harry
she
slid
out
of
heaven
while
i
only
slid
down
hill
where
is
your
car
mr
marvin
up
on
the
hill
if
the
kind
persons
who
cut
the
chain
did
take
it
with
them
owen
did
not
change
color
i
will
go
and
see
if
it
is
there
if
not
i
find
hicks
and
his
runabout
he
waiting
somewhere
about
he
set
off
briskly
up
the
road
polly
you
still
trust
that
man
asked
harry
one
has
to
trust
one
guardian
does
one
he
tossed
his
hands
above
his
head
in
a
gesture
of
give
it
all
up
that
right
keep
there
said
a
rough
voice
and
a
wiry
man
with
white
handkerchiefs
tied
over
his
face
below
the
eyes
sprang
with
crunching
strides
through
the
bushes
keep
up
your
hands
i
say
he
thundered
at
harry
as
he
leveled
a
revolver
pauline
was
beside
him
and
harry
dared
not
move
but
pauline
dared
with
the
resourceful
courage
that
always
inspired
her
she
whipped
his
revolver
out
his
hip
pocket
and
fired
at
the
intruder
head
his
hat
fluttered
off
into
the
road
he
sprang
at
pauline
and
wrested
the
gun
from
her
as
harry
rushed
him
he
had
no
time
to
fire
but
the
butt
of
one
revolver
crashed
on
the
young
man
forehead
harry
sank
unconscious
in
the
road
pauline
knelt
beside
him
she
was
screaming
for
owen
even
for
hicks
hicks
was
instantly
beside
her
but
not
to
aid
or
rescue
for
hicks
was
the
man
with
the
handkerchief
mask
he
half
dragged
half
carried
pauline
to
a
thicket
that
concealed
the
runabout
he
drew
a
roll
of
tire
tape
from
under
the
seat
and
bound
it
cruelly
around
her
lips
he
took
ropes
and
tied
her
hands
and
feet
placed
her
in
the
seat
beside
him
and
started
the
machine
if
harry
struggling
to
rise
out
of
the
dust
of
the
road
could
have
seen
pauline
now
bound
and
gagged
beside
hicks
in
the
runabout
he
would
have
known
her
to
be
in
greater
peril
than
ever
the
balloon
had
brought
her
pauline
was
not
long
unhidden
as
the
quick
ear
of
hicks
caught
the
sound
of
wheels
he
grasped
her
roughly
by
the
arm
and
thrust
her
into
the
bottom
of
the
machine
without
taking
his
hand
from
the
lever
or
slackening
speed
he
pulled
a
blanket
over
her
and
tucked
it
in
with
one
hand
do
move
either
he
growled
or
you
know
a
farmer
on
his
wagon
came
around
a
bend
his
cheery
good
morning
brought
only
a
grunt
from
hicks
but
the
sound
of
the
kind
voice
thrilled
pauline
she
struggled
under
the
blanket
and
almost
reached
a
sitting
posture
before
hicks
crushed
her
back
the
runabout
had
flashed
by
but
the
farmer
had
seen
something
that
alarmed
even
his
stolid
mind
when
a
half
mile
up
the
road
he
came
upon
a
young
man
dazed
and
wounded
staggering
through
the
dust
he
drew
rein
and
leaped
out
a
draught
of
whiskey
from
the
farmer
bottle
braced
harry
you
passed
them
on
the
road
he
cried
a
machine
with
a
man
in
it
and
somethin
else
somethin
in
the
bottom
of
it
that
moved
said
the
farmer
a
horse
said
harry
quick
one
of
yours
will
do
the
farmer
hesitated
harry
thrust
money
into
his
hand
quick
he
shouted
together
they
unharnessed
the
team
coatless
and
hatless
tattered
wounded
and
stained
harry
swung
himself
to
the
bare
back
of
a
stirrupless
steed
and
galloped
out
on
what
he
knew
was
the
most
dangerous
of
all
the
pathways
of
pauline
chapter
xii
the
old
grigsby
house
pays
penance
to
young
bassett
of
the
american
the
excitement
of
existence
since
he
became
a
reporter
and
joined
the
jehus
of
the
truth
wagon
had
consisted
mainly
of
chasing
pictures
in
the
afternoons
and
going
to
strings
of
banquets
at
night
he
had
no
more
enthusiasm
for
photographs
than
he
had
for
banquets
word
painting
and
graining
was
his
art
and
so
when
a
big
story
walked
up
and
beckoned
to
him
he
was
as
happy
as
a
boy
in
love
it
had
been
a
dull
day
for
news
the
evening
papers
were
barren
of
suggestions
and
the
assignments
had
run
out
before
bassett
name
was
reached
that
meant
another
afternoon
of
dismal
lingering
in
the
office
without
even
a
photograph
to
chase
bassett
flung
himself
disgustedly
into
a
chair
and
straightened
a
newspaper
with
a
vicious
crackle
as
the
last
of
the
other
reporters
hurried
out
he
thought
he
caught
a
gleam
of
merry
pity
in
the
reporter
eye
never
mind
let
laugh
let
wait
one
of
these
days
he
be
the
one
getting
the
real
stuff
and
putting
it
through
too
from
tip
to
type
without
a
rewrite
man
or
a
copy
reader
touching
it
let
wait
in
a
balloon
where
the
suddenly
vibrant
voice
of
the
city
editor
talking
over
the
telephone
caused
bassett
to
lower
his
paper
and
hushed
even
the
chatter
of
the
office
boys
palisades
panatella
yes
who
the
girl
you
do
know
the
paper
dropped
from
bassett
hands
much
obliged
i
have
a
man
over
there
but
you
go
right
ahead
the
city
editor
clicked
down
the
receiver
and
whirled
in
his
chair
oh
bassett
our
weehawken
man
says
a
young
woman
has
been
carried
off
by
panatella
balloon
they
lost
the
balloon
get
a
car
and
get
over
there
quick
go
as
far
as
you
like
only
find
the
girl
and
let
me
hear
from
you
quick
bassett
jumped
to
a
phone
and
ordered
a
machine
to
meet
him
at
street
he
ran
down
william
street
with
his
straw
hat
under
his
arm
and
dived
into
the
subway
an
express
had
him
at
street
in
a
few
minutes
his
machine
was
there
they
dashed
for
the
ferry
and
were
on
the
aviation
field
before
the
bewildered
crowd
that
had
witnessed
the
runaway
flight
of
the
balloon
had
dispersed
bassett
jumped
out
and
mingled
with
the
people
they
knew
nothing
except
the
general
direction
toward
the
west
that
the
balloon
had
taken
automobilists
had
pursued
for
a
long
way
but
had
seen
the
gas
bag
turn
to
the
north
and
disappear
in
the
hills
the
automobilists
had
returned
most
of
them
two
who
had
been
with
the
girl
before
she
leaped
into
the
basket
had
not
returned
bassett
got
back
in
the
car
beside
the
driver
and
they
glided
off
on
the
westward
road
every
one
in
the
farm
houses
along
the
route
had
seen
the
balloon
but
the
houses
were
further
and
further
apart
as
bassett
course
was
drawn
northward
and
often
he
missed
the
trail
the
trail
was
blazed
by
the
wheel
ruts
of
a
giant
touring
car
and
a
small
runabout
that
frequently
left
the
highways
and
plowed
across
the
fields
he
lost
them
in
the
middle
of
a
field
that
was
marshy
where
the
automobiles
left
the
road
and
at
the
middle
and
further
side
after
a
maneuvering
he
ordered
the
driver
to
go
back
to
the
road
maybe
they
done
the
same
thing
turned
round
an
come
back
suggested
the
chauffeur
hello
what
kind
of
a
rig
is
that
he
added
as
a
wagon
appeared
around
a
bend
in
the
road
the
peculiar
thing
about
the
rig
was
that
while
it
was
a
tongued
wagon
with
whiffletrees
for
two
horses
there
was
only
one
horse
the
driver
a
bearded
farmer
was
urging
the
patient
animal
on
although
it
was
impossible
for
it
to
do
more
than
plod
in
its
awkward
harness
what
the
matter
called
bassett
cheerily
as
the
machine
drew
alongside
and
stopped
i
dunno
replied
the
farmer
shaking
his
grizzled
bead
ef
i
was
a
young
feller
like
you
i
go
right
off
an
find
out
i
go
right
away
what
up
i
dunno
i
ai
knowed
anythin
like
it
in
this
part
o
the
country
in
fifty
year
first
down
yonder
on
the
old
river
road
i
meets
a
autymobile
with
a
man
drivin
it
and
somethin
alive
an
movin
in
a
blanket
by
his
feet
i
ai
got
a
half
mile
back
from
there
when
i
finds
a
fine
young
feller
with
his
good
clothes
what
he
got
left
tore
to
pieces
no
shoes
or
hat
on
him
an
his
head
bleedin
bad
from
cuts
are
they
did
you
see
a
autymobile
he
yells
at
me
i
tells
him
what
i
had
saw
an
he
takes
my
off
hoss
there
an
goes
gallopin
up
the
road
what
road
cried
bassett
ye
circle
this
here
field
an
climb
the
hill
then
take
the
first
turn
which
way
west
if
you
do
want
ter
jump
in
the
river
what
we
back
at
the
river
gasped
bassett
that
about
my
luck
the
balloon
gone
over
the
river
it
in
new
york
and
some
harlem
reporter
is
leading
it
down
to
his
office
on
a
leash
to
have
it
photographed
and
i
i
hoodooed
that
all
i
dunno
said
the
farmer
but
ef
ye
ast
me
i
say
that
feller
in
the
autymoble
was
makin
for
the
woods
beyond
quirksborough
lonely
up
through
there
an
he
had
somethin
in
that
there
machine
that
he
wanted
to
keep
lonely
i
guessin
bassett
motioned
to
the
driver
to
go
on
we
might
as
well
see
what
it
is
the
balloon
gone
home
for
supper
he
said
bitterly
in
five
minutes
they
reached
the
turn
where
the
farmer
had
last
seen
harry
marvin
disappear
they
took
the
turn
into
an
road
that
had
cast
its
blight
of
brown
upon
the
reeds
bordering
it
the
woods
became
more
and
more
dense
and
the
road
more
narrow
in
some
places
the
dust
was
crusted
as
it
had
dried
after
the
last
rain
and
the
men
in
the
automobile
could
see
that
the
wheels
of
another
machine
and
the
hoofs
of
a
galloping
horse
had
plunged
through
this
crust
but
a
short
time
before
around
a
bend
in
the
road
going
at
full
speed
bassett
sighted
harry
marvin
for
the
first
time
he
stood
up
beside
the
driver
and
hailed
him
but
harry
did
not
even
turn
around
the
beat
of
his
horse
hoofs
drowned
the
sound
the
deep
lines
of
the
runabout
wheels
in
the
dust
held
his
gaze
and
his
senses
to
one
thing
alone
the
rescue
of
pauline
he
urged
the
poor
beast
to
its
last
tug
of
strength
weak
and
dizzy
from
his
wound
he
knew
that
he
could
go
but
a
little
way
afoot
the
road
high
wall
of
trees
was
broken
for
the
first
time
by
a
little
clearing
harry
passing
glance
showed
him
that
there
was
a
house
in
the
clearing
he
was
exhausted
and
a
thirst
but
his
eyes
swept
back
to
the
wheel
tracks
on
the
road
the
runabout
had
gone
on
harry
without
drawing
rein
was
about
to
follow
but
suddenly
weirdly
the
rickety
walls
of
the
deserted
house
gave
forth
a
sound
a
rattle
and
a
crash
and
from
a
shuttered
window
beside
the
door
bellied
a
sheet
of
smoke
harry
reined
the
foaming
horse
and
sprang
off
freed
of
his
weight
the
animal
staggered
on
a
few
paces
and
fell
panting
in
the
dust
harry
did
not
see
it
he
was
battering
at
the
door
of
the
burning
house
hicks
could
hardly
be
called
a
nervous
or
a
timid
man
he
was
certainly
not
a
coward
like
owen
but
neither
did
he
have
the
shrewd
scheming
mind
which
was
the
bulwark
of
the
craven
weakness
at
the
moment
when
they
discovered
the
young
lovers
safe
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
after
the
escape
from
the
balloon
and
rock
ledge
the
two
arch
conspirators
were
two
very
different
men
owen
was
shaking
like
a
leaf
in
his
terror
of
discovery
but
thinking
of
a
hundred
schemes
to
save
himself
hicks
was
deadly
cool
and
thinking
of
just
one
thing
immediate
and
murder
but
now
although
he
thought
he
had
killed
harry
although
he
knew
he
had
pauline
gagged
and
bound
in
the
bottom
of
the
runabout
hicks
was
afraid
he
was
afraid
of
the
incompleteness
of
the
thing
he
was
eager
to
have
done
with
the
girl
as
well
as
with
the
man
and
now
this
latest
plan
of
owen
was
but
another
chapter
of
procrastination
the
incident
of
the
farmer
curiosity
had
unnerved
him
too
he
put
back
over
his
face
one
of
the
white
handkerchiefs
that
he
had
taken
off
when
he
began
the
flight
there
no
more
stuff
in
this
he
said
gruffly
to
pauline
if
you
do
keep
quiet
i
kill
you
i
mean
what
i
say
he
still
had
the
instinctive
crook
sense
to
conceal
his
natural
voice
hicks
was
afraid
but
as
mile
after
mile
fell
behind
them
and
the
westerning
sun
gave
promise
of
the
early
shelter
of
dark
he
began
to
gain
confidence
he
mumbled
to
himself
reminiscently
the
old
grigsby
house
eh
nobody
but
he
checked
himself
nobody
but
somebody
would
thought
that
the
old
grigsby
house
in
front
of
which
the
runabout
came
to
a
stop
after
many
miles
of
travel
was
set
back
from
the
road
about
three
hundred
yards
in
front
of
it
and
on
either
side
the
trees
had
been
cut
away
but
a
tangle
of
riotous
shrubbery
lined
the
path
to
the
door
behind
the
house
the
trees
had
been
left
untouched
and
now
in
its
tottering
condition
the
venerable
building
literally
rested
on
two
of
the
great
elms
like
an
old
man
on
crutches
the
windows
were
few
and
shuttered
the
black
steel
blinds
were
dead
as
the
eyes
of
a
skull
the
steel
was
not
rusted
and
only
a
little
there
were
no
steps
to
the
door
it
opened
on
the
ground
level
with
a
cracked
board
serving
as
both
porch
and
foot
mat
the
signs
of
attempted
preservation
were
what
gave
the
place
its
ominous
air
there
was
a
menace
in
the
steel
shutters
of
the
old
grigsby
house
and
in
the
fact
that
the
path
to
the
door
was
kept
clear
up
this
path
hicks
carried
pauline
before
he
lifted
her
in
his
arms
he
tested
her
bonds
he
did
not
know
that
pauline
was
too
terrified
to
conceive
the
simplest
plan
of
action
compared
with
the
fear
that
possessed
her
now
the
torturing
suspense
of
the
balloon
flight
seemed
like
peace
and
safety
hicks
held
her
with
one
arm
while
with
the
other
he
unlocked
the
low
door
swinging
heavy
on
strong
hinges
it
opened
into
a
narrow
hall
mildewed
with
the
dampness
of
decay
the
dust
of
disuse
he
carried
pauline
up
the
stairs
which
groaned
and
bent
under
his
steps
and
pushed
open
a
door
there
was
a
broken
chair
a
table
a
cot
a
washstand
with
pitcher
and
bowl
and
a
small
oil
lamp
set
in
a
bracket
on
the
wail
hicks
laid
pauline
on
the
cot
and
lighted
the
lamp
using
the
same
match
for
a
cigarette
he
seemed
spurred
by
a
desire
to
get
away
as
if
the
tottering
grimy
halls
held
memories
too
grim
for
even
his
hardened
soul
after
testing
the
shutters
of
the
window
which
were
locked
on
the
outside
he
stepped
back
to
the
cot
and
cut
pauline
bonds
and
removed
the
bandage
from
her
lips
as
she
fell
back
in
a
half
swoon
he
hurried
through
the
door
closed
and
locked
it
and
went
down
the
stairs
half
way
down
he
stopped
abruptly
stood
for
a
moment
listening
then
hastened
on
dropping
his
cigarette
over
the
banister
he
did
not
see
where
it
fell
he
did
not
care
his
only
aim
was
to
get
out
to
get
away
he
had
heard
a
sound
as
he
came
down
the
stairs
that
turned
his
fear
to
terror
it
was
the
distant
grumble
of
an
automobile
horn
he
locked
the
door
and
sped
down
the
path
to
the
runabout
he
had
left
it
in
the
middle
of
the
road
so
that
as
he
leaped
in
and
started
again
it
left
no
swerve
of
its
wheel
ruts
toward
the
old
grigsby
house
it
was
five
miles
to
the
nearest
town
but
hicks
made
it
in
twenty
minutes
and
without
hearing
again
the
threatening
automobile
horn
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
telephone
to
owen
for
half
an
hour
owen
had
been
locked
in
the
library
of
the
marvin
house
the
events
of
the
early
afternoon
the
failure
of
his
plans
the
suspense
of
waiting
the
result
of
hicks
final
move
had
made
him
a
nervous
wreck
he
had
lighted
a
dozen
cigars
and
thrown
them
away
as
many
times
he
had
picked
up
the
telephone
only
to
set
it
down
again
without
calling
a
number
at
last
he
had
taken
out
the
thin
tube
of
light
pills
had
drawn
the
shades
switched
on
the
electric
lights
and
sat
down
to
wait
for
the
that
morphine
brought
to
his
conscience
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
awaiting
the
effect
of
the
drug
the
mummy
in
its
case
stood
in
front
of
him
he
closed
his
eyes
in
a
pleasant
stupor
he
opened
them
in
terror
for
a
moment
his
hands
were
outstretched
in
front
of
him
with
fingers
clutching
at
thin
air
then
he
covered
his
eyes
with
them
to
shut
from
view
the
mummy
which
stood
over
him
its
upraised
hand
pointing
to
him
the
finger
of
accusation
its
woman
eyes
blazing
with
anger
its
cold
lips
speaking
a
message
that
chilled
his
blood
the
telephone
bell
jangled
again
and
again
before
owen
found
courage
to
open
his
eyes
when
he
did
so
he
clutched
at
the
instrument
eager
for
the
sound
of
a
human
voice
hello
yes
this
is
owen
he
glanced
apprehensively
over
his
shoulder
at
the
mummy
its
hand
was
lowered
and
it
stood
motionless
as
before
he
turned
excitedly
back
to
the
telephone
it
you
hicks
what
news
she
at
grigsby
what
do
you
mean
somebody
after
you
not
him
i
give

word

that
road

two
months

police

jersey

to
pieces

over
there
i
join
you
tonight
yes
go
back
to
the
house
and
watch
what
all
right
pauline
left
alone
began
to
regain
her
courage
after
a
few
moments
she
was
able
to
stand
up
and
move
slowly
about
her
prison
room
she
tried
the
door
and
the
window
shutters
mechanically
she
searched
the
room
for
something
that
might
be
used
to
batter
down
the
door
there
was
nothing
she
sat
on
the
cot
and
tried
to
think
she
sprang
up
again
trembling
the
dry
choking
smell
of
smoke
had
reached
her
hicks
lighted
cigarette
had
fallen
among
the
wisps
of
old
wall
paper
in
the
hall
she
ran
to
the
door
baffled
piteous
alone
she
turned
and
looked
on
death
for
through
the
cracks
in
the
floor
flashed
now
the
golden
daggers
of
flame
in
sheaths
of
stifling
smoke
she
cowered
choking
by
the
outer
wall
of
the
room
the
flame
daggers
grew
into
scimitars
the
inner
wall
caught
fire
there
was
no
outlet
for
the
suffocating
smoke
she
sprang
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
seized
the
broken
chair
with
all
her
might
she
crashed
it
against
the
door
it
fell
in
pieces
at
her
feet
she
picked
up
a
leg
of
the
chair
and
running
to
the
window
pounded
upon
the
shutters
she
screamed
and
beat
upon
the
shutters
it
was
the
rattle
and
crash
upon
the
shutters
that
made
harry
rein
in
his
horse
before
the
old
grigsby
house
he
saw
smoke
burst
from
the
lower
windows
and
battering
on
the
locked
door
he
heard
her
screams
harry
harry
it
was
to
him
she
called
again
in
her
peril
as
she
had
called
before
in
the
wreck
of
the
yacht
in
the
den
of
baskinelli
and
even
this
day
from
the
rim
of
the
runaway
balloon
always
inspired
by
that
call
he
had
found
their
way
to
safety
he
thrust
the
full
weight
of
his
mighty
body
against
the
door
which
held
like
solid
rock
harry
harry
came
the
cries
again
i
coming
polly
i
here
he
dashed
to
where
a
heavy
tree
limb
had
fallen
carried
it
to
the
door
raised
it
and
charged
with
it
as
a
battering
ram
he
might
as
well
have
slapped
the
door
with
his
flat
palm
he
looked
at
the
windows
whence
the
smoke
poured
smoke
mingled
with
flame
half
crazed
by
the
cries
from
above
he
raised
the
limb
to
try
to
break
the
shutters
he
stopped
and
let
it
fall
the
toot
of
an
automobile
horn
and
the
excited
voice
of
young
bassett
stopped
him
what
doing
gasped
the
reporter
is
anybody
in
there
harry
pointed
to
the
shuttered
window
of
the
upper
room
the
cries
came
again
and
with
the
sound
of
the
woman
voice
bassett
turned
sick
he
made
a
dizzy
charge
at
the
door
but
harry
caught
him
back
all
three
together
he
said
they
flung
their
strength
at
the
portal
but
still
it
held
bassett
turned
away
sobbing
he
looked
up
to
see
harry
spring
into
the
big
car
which
he
forced
through
the
brambles
what
are
you
doing
you
crazy
yelled
the
chauffeur
running
toward
the
machine
get
her
if
i
ca
after
the
smash
was
harry
answer
the
car
lunged
on
at
full
speed
the
impact
rocked
the
burning
house
frame
and
door
crashed
down
together
before
the
battering
car
it
plowed
for
half
its
length
into
the
smoke
and
fire
stopped
an
instant
quivered
and
backed
out
again
splendid
ruin
on
harry
forehead
a
deep
cut
streamed
bassett
sprang
to
catch
him
but
he
climbed
out
unhelped
together
they
leaped
the
shattered
wall
through
searing
smoke
they
climbed
the
quaking
stairs
and
burst
into
the
shuttered
room
the
lamp
still
flickered
dimly
in
its
bracket
pauline
called
harry
chokingly
pauline
answer
me
there
was
no
answer
on
hands
and
knees
he
groped
over
the
hot
floor
he
found
her
by
the
window
where
she
had
fallen
and
flames
choked
them
as
they
fled
outside
he
knelt
beside
her
chafing
her
hands
when
she
wakened
he
had
turned
her
so
that
she
did
not
see
the
towering
glare
of
the
flames
as
the
old
grigsby
house
furnished
burnt
penance
for
its
crimes
pauline
raised
her
arms
and
touched
tenderly
his
bleeding
brow
he
lifted
her
into
the
car
that
bassett
and
the
driver
had
patched
up
home
james
said
bassett
with
a
tired
grin
but
stop
at
a
telephone
somewhere
and
let
me
tell
my
boss
that
i
got
a
piece
for
the
paper
chapter
xiii
double
cross
ranch
i
tell
you
harry
i
ca
endure
it
i
could
face
anyone
i
know
i
want
to
run
away
far
far
away
where
nobody
ever
heard
of
balloons
or
automobiles
or
me
polly
you
are
afraid
of
a
little
talk
are
you
everyone
is
saying
how
brave
you
were
and
here
when
the
danger
over
i
find
you
a
flimsy
little
coward
she
picked
up
one
of
a
pile
of
newspapers
that
lay
on
the
stand
beside
her
and
thrust
it
before
harry
eyes
with
a
manner
at
once
questioning
and
rebuking
he
read
the
head
lines
society
girl
carried
off
in
balloon
miss
pauline
marvin
has
remarkable
experience
after
accident
on
palisades
harry
laughed
and
patted
her
hand
reassuringly
oh
but
that
only
one
of
them
wailed
pauline
look
at
this
one
pauline
marvin
lost
in
the
sky
can
any
woman
live
after
that
she
cried
why
it
no
crime
to
be
lost
in
a
balloon
said
harry
see
they
tell
it
just
as
it
was
they
make
you
a
real
heroine
a
man
might
live
it
down
dear
but
a
woman
never
to
be
in
the
sky
is
altogether
too
giddy
margaret
she
called
the
maid
stepped
quickly
forward
you
may
pack
my
things
margaret
and
be
sure
to
put
in
some
warm
winter
ones
is
the
snow
on
mountains
cold
like
real
snow
or
is
it
like
the
frosting
on
cake
she
inquired
turning
again
to
harry
what
are
you
up
to
this
time
he
demanded
montana
first
she
proclaimed
with
a
melodramatic
flourish
and
if
i
am
followed
by
my
fame
or
by
my
relatives
i
shall
go
on
to
the
end
of
the
world
harry
had
long
ago
abandoned
the
idea
of
laughing
at
her
whims
even
the
most
fantastic
of
her
projects
was
serious
to
her
he
merely
looked
at
her
in
mute
suspense
awaiting
the
fall
of
the
blow
you
need
begin
to
see
she
laughed
but
i
am
going
harry
i
going
to
accept
mary
haines
invitation
and
visit
her
and
her
nice
queer
husband
on
their
ranch
you
remember
haines
that
dear
western
girl
that
we
met
on
the
steamer
when
she
was
on
her
honeymoon
well
it
pretty
tough
just
at
this
time
objected
harry
business
is
bothersome
and
i
ought
to
be
here
but
if
you
insist
oh
you
not
coming
with
me
stated
pauline
cheerily
in
the
first
place
you
are
not
invited
and
in
the
second
place
you
are
not
needed
in
the
least
now
get
me
a
telegraph
blank
he
came
back
with
the
desired
paper
and
a
fountain
pen
and
she
scribbled
mary
haines
rockvale
montana

double
cross
ranch

will
explain
haste
when
see
pauline
marvin
run
down
and
that
to
the
telegraph
office
she
told
harry
and
now
for
the
packing
margaret
she
thrust
a
tiny
foot
in
a
pink
slipper
over
the
edge
of
the
bed
but
you
are
ill
miss
marvin
protested
the
nurse
with
a
first
faint
assertion
of
authority
that
so
said
polly
how
can
we
get
around
that
oh
yes
time
for
your
airing
dear
and
when
you
come
back
i
shall
be
well
and
packed
plenty
of
air
suggested
harry
sarcastically
from
the
doorway
if
it
takes
you
as
long
to
pack
as
it
does
to
put
on
your
hat
pauline
flung
him
a
laughing
grimace
and
he
strode
off
to
the
library
as
he
was
repeating
the
brief
message
to
the
telegraph
office
he
did
not
hear
the
light
footfalls
that
ceased
at
the
library
door
nor
could
he
see
the
drawn
gray
face
of
owen
who
heard
the
message
spoken
over
the
telephone
and
was
passing
up
the
stairs
with
his
slow
dignified
tread
when
harry
came
into
the
hall
good
morning
harry
i
see
you
are
quite
yourself
again
yesterday
was
a
terrible
day
you
do
look
done
up
retorted
harry
curtly
as
he
picked
up
his
hat
owen
step
was
not
slow
or
dignified
after
the
door
shut
upon
harry
he
sprang
up
the
last
stairs
and
into
his
own
room
here
on
a
small
writing
desk
was
another
telephone
he
snatched
it
up
nervously
and
gave
the
call
number
of
the
place
where
he
had
held
his
first
conference
with
hicks
he
held
a
brief
conversation
over
the
wire
snapped
down
the
receiver
sprang
to
a
wardrobe
for
his
hat
and
stick
and
hurried
from
the
house
the
dullness
that
a
sleepless
night
had
left
in
his
eyes
had
disappeared
the
fear
that
had
shaken
him
ever
since
the
uncanny
reappearance
of
harry
and
pauline
was
dissipated
or
at
least
concealed
by
a
new
hope
a
new
plan
of
destruction
he
knew
only
that
pauline
was
going
away
and
that
she
must
be
followed
no
matter
whither
her
whims
might
lead
hicks
was
seated
in
a
corner
of
the
rendezvous
drinking
whiskey
and
water
he
was
plainly
in
a
black
mood
you
got
a
pretty
fat
roll
yesterday
hicks
but
owen
drew
out
his
wallet
here
is
a
little
get
yourself
ready
to

a
trip
tomorrow
i
let
you
know
the
time
and
the
train
hicks
looked
covetously
at
the
bills
but
he
demurred
you
mean
after
them
two
again
hicks
we
must
be
after
them
because
one
of
them
will
soon
be
after
us
where

now
rockvale
montana
that
is
the
girl

what
i

is
whether
harry

too
if
he
stays
here
i
stay
and
you
go
west
after
pauline
ahead
of
her
and
then
what
then
you
will
have
to
use
your
own
judgment
but
do
get
excited
and
kill
her
hicks
he
accompanied
the
sharp
warning
with
the
alleviating
roll
of
yellowbacks
which
hicks
quickly
deposited
in
an
inside
pocket
the
next
morning
they
shook
hands
at
the
gate
of
the
pennsylvania
station
hicks
looking
a
bit
uncomfortable
but
much
improved
in
a
suit
of
new
clothes
and
carrying
a
suitcase
hurried
to
catch
the
flyer
for
the
west
a
few
hours
later
owen
was
wishing
a
happy
journey
to
pauline
at
the
same
station
rail
mary
haines
stood
in
the
low
doorway
of
the
double
cross
ranch
house
and
gazed
down
the
road
to
where
in
the
far
distance
a
little
wisp
of
dust
was
visible
laughing
she
turned
and
called
to
someone
inside
the
house
a
towering
but
man
in
a
flannel
shirt
with
corduroys
tucked
into
the
tops
of
spurred
boots
appeared
on
the
stoop
hal
haines
was
so
tall
that
his
hat
grazed
the
porch
roof
of
the
house
hal
hal
she
cried
eagerly
what
do

think
pauline
marvin
is
coming
to
visit
us
pauline
marvin
the
little
girl

just
this
once
his
boyish
joy
in
the
prank
brought
laughter
to
her
eyes
and
he
knew
that
his
sins
would
be
condoned
four
days
later
hicks
who
looked
as
far
from
home
in
his
excellent
clothes
as
the
clothes
looked
far
from
home
in
rockvale
alighted
from
a
lumbering
local
train
he
made
an
inquiry
of
a
man
on
the
platform
and
carrying
a
heavy
suitcase
slouched
up
the
main
street
of
the
town
ham
dalton
place
was
the
one
the
man
had
directed
him
to
and
hicks
i
after
engaging
the
best
rooms
in
the
house
for
cents
scrubbed
a
little
of
the
dust
of
travel
from
his
person
and
went
down
to
the
bar
and
gambling
room
the
drink
of
whiskey
he
got
made
even
his
trained
throat
writhe
and
he
strolled
over
to
the
poker
table
to
join
a
group
of
calm
and
spectators
of
high
play
from
the
conversation
he
learned
that
the
dam
at
red
gut
was
washed
out
that
case
egan
a
noted
rancher
was
in
jail
for
shooting
a
deputy
sheriff
and
that
hal
haines
was
expecting
a
millionairess
gal
visitor
from
new
york
when
she
be
on
drawled
one
of
the
players
tomorrow
express
sence
when
did
the
express
stop
at
rockvale
sence
the
president
o
the
road
told
it
to
stop
for
this
here
young
person
replied
the
informant
crushingly
hicks
was
scanning
the
faces
of
the
men
about
him
with
a
purposeful
eye
especially
he
watched
one
a
lean
man
in
red
shirt
and
leather
breeches
booted
and
spurred
who
stood
near
the
table
hicks
approached
him
hello
patten
he
said
the
man
whirled
so
sharply
that
the
revolver
he
had
drawn
in
whirling
caught
in
hick
coat
and
jerked
him
into
the
middle
of
the
room
the
poker
game
went
on
without
a
sound
or
sign
of
interruption
the
bartender
took
a
casual
look
at
hicks
and
the
gunman
then
went
on
talking
to
a
customer
as
before
hello
hicks
said
patten
putting
up
the
gun
i
much
obliged
that
i
did
kill
you
we
do
greet
old
friends
quite
so
hasty
out
here
boy
as
you
do
in
new
york
especially
when
we
have
heard
our
right
name
in
some
years
he
added
in
a
lowered
voice
how
long
have
you
been
here
pat
years
ever
since
that
friend
of
yours
owen
paid
me
for
getting
rid
of
a
certain
what
he
called
a
certain
obstacle
which
you
did
get
rid
of
no
he
made
the
mistake
of
paying
me
in
advance
and
it
did
seem
necessary
to
harm
anybody
got
any
of
the
money
left
the
lean
gunman
held
his
head
back
and
guffawed
it
near
here
i
guess
but
it
ai
mine
it
dropped
between
this
bar
and
that
table
do
you
want
a
little
job
asked
hicks
but
let
go
in
the
back
room
they
strolled
into
an
empty
wine
room
and
ordered
drinks
what
kind
of
a
job
asked
patten
hicks
leaned
across
the
table
and
whispered
rapidly
his
old
acquaintance
drew
back
with
a
sudden
suspicion
but
no
foolin
this
time
warned
hicks
only
part
money
in
advance
he
produced
in
bills
from
his
trousers
pocket
but
secreted
it
again
quickly
as
the
waiter
appeared
patten
got
up
and
sauntered
out
into
the
barroom
returning
presently
with
three
men
of
his
own
brand
ruffians
of
the
far
north
country
three
of
case
egan
cattlemen
in
the
meantime
haines
was
flustered
not
only
by
the
prospect
of
meeting
her
distinguished
friend
but
by
the
tumultuous
staging
of
the
great
scene
that
was
to
mark
pauline
welcome
hal
had
been
up
at
three
in
the
morning
rehearsing
the
boys
in
their
parts
he
had
set
off
at
five
for
the
station
as
pauline
trim
in
her
traveling
suit
of
gray
and
blithe
in
the
clear
western
air
tripped
from
the
express
all
rockvale
was
there
to
meet
her
hal
haines
mighty
man
that
he
was
in
the
region
was
red
with
pride
as
the
girl
who
could
stop
the
express
at
rockvale
gave
him
her
hand
in
happy
greeting
as
he
helped
her
into
the
buckboard
no
one
in
the
crowd
noticed
the
man
who
had
arrived
the
night
before
standing
on
the
platform
and
pointing
out
the
girl
to
tom
patten
who
was
seen
to
mount
and
ride
rapidly
away
i
hope
you
saved
some
of
that
lovely
wild
west
for
me
haines
said
pauline
as
the
finest
pair
of
horses
in
the
double
cross
stable
whisked
them
along
the
road
to
the
ranch
very
little
left
miss
marvin
very
little
left
still
whoa
there
what
this
at
a
bend
in
the
road
five
masked
and
mounted
men
had
dashed
from
cover
and
quickly
surrounded
the
buckboard
with
a
small
circle
of
leveled
pauline
had
time
to
cry
out
only
once
before
she
felt
herself
gripped
by
powerful
hands
and
dragged
from
the
wagon
seat
where
hal
haines
sat
shaking
with
laughter
he
stood
up
and
started
to
draw
his
revolver
slowly
from
behind
him
a
lasso
was
thrown
lightly
and
the
noose
tightened
around
his
arms
he
kept
on
laughing
although
he
was
a
little
afraid
the
boys
were
overdoing
matters
he
knew
his
wife
would
never
forgive
him
for
this
actual
kidnapping
of
pauline
he
certainly
had
never
intended
it
and
she
was
really
frightened
he
could
tell
that
by
her
cries
as
she
was
thrust
across
the
pommel
of
the
masked
leader
horse
and
the
horse
was
spurred
to
a
tearing
gallop
down
the
road
haines
tried
to
shout
a
command
and
call
the
joke
off
but
the
riders
had
all
followed
after
their
leader
and
he
was
alone
in
the
buckboard
they
need
have
been
so
realistic
with
their
knots
he
said
as
he
struggled
to
free
himself
from
the
rope
it
was
ten
minutes
before
he
wriggled
free
he
picked
up
the
lines
and
drove
on
toward
the
ranch
a
little
nervous
now
over
the
receptions
he
would
get
but
still
laughing
at
the
fork
where
the
road
to
the
mountains
left
the
main
highway
haines
flashed
out
his
revolver
in
real
excitement
another
group
of
five
masked
men
had
driven
their
horses
out
of
a
clump
of
small
trees
they
fired
their
revolvers
as
they
surrounded
the
buckboard
then
suddenly
discovering
that
there
was
no
woman
passenger
they
tore
off
their
masks
and
came
up
with
quick
eager
inquiries
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
hal
haines
knew
what
fear
was
not
fear
for
himself
but
for
another
boys
there
was
another
party
on
the
road
they
took
her
i
took
for
you
he
said
in
a
stifled
voice
come
on
cabot
give
me
your
horse
take
the
rig
back
and
tell
mrs
haines
he
sprang
into
the
saddle
and
filling
their
revolvers
as
they
rode
the
band
of
jesters
who
had
suddenly
turned
so
grimly
serious
dashed
back
toward
town
two
miles
from
where
tom
patten
had
swung
pauline
to
his
saddle
bow
they
picked
up
the
train
hoofs
that
left
the
road
and
made
toward
the
mountains
the
men
who
had
set
out
so
gaily
a
few
hours
before
rode
silently
fiercely
now
mile
after
mile
swept
behind
them
as
they
held
to
the
trail
sometimes
it
followed
the
roads
sometimes
it
broke
over
open
country
at
last
it
reached
the
hills
and
stopped
at
the
river
patten
band
had
ridden
in
the
water
upstream
after
a
mile
of
it
the
leader
ordered
three
of
them
out
on
the
south
side
they
left
silently
rode
five
miles
across
country
and
separated
each
taking
a
different
route
patten
and
one
companion
kept
on
with
pauline
who
was
now
almost
insensible
at
last
they
left
the
stream
on
the
north
bank
and
climbed
into
the
higher
hill
country
where
they
entered
a
thicket
and
stopped
here
we
are
said
patten
his
companion
dismounted
and
lifted
pauline
from
the
other
saddle
with
a
swift
daring
and
dexterity
born
of
fear
she
flung
aside
his
arms
and
sprang
toward
the
horse
he
had
just
left
she
tried
to
mount
but
her
strength
was
gone
they
tied
her
feet
with
a
rope
and
seated
her
on
a
great
fallen
tree
while
they
cleared
away
a
tangle
of
bushes
and
began
to
tug
with
their
combined
strength
at
a
giant
rock
which
the
bushes
had
concealed
the
stone
moved
inch
by
inch
until
behind
it
pauline
saw
with
a
chill
shudder
the
black
opening
of
a
cave
she
flung
herself
from
the
log
pleading
piteously
they
cut
the
rope
that
bound
her
feet
and
led
her
to
the
cave
as
the
giant
stone
was
rolled
back
into
its
place
she
uttered
one
wild
cry
then
darkness
for
many
minutes
pauline
lay
prostrate
a
dim
light
from
some
hidden
orifice
in
the
top
of
the
cave
behind
a
shelving
wall
seemed
to
become
brighter
as
her
eyes
became
more
accustomed
to
the
shadows
she
arose
and
began
to
inspect
the
cave
it
was
a
chamber
of
rock
about
forty
feet
long
and
twenty
feet
wide
the
bottom
and
roof
converged
slightly
towards
the
end
farthest
from
the
giant
boulder
that
formed
the
door
but
even
there
the
cave
was
feet
high
the
boulder
door
was
set
into
the
rock
portal
and
not
a
wisp
of
light
came
through
the
brush
that
covered
the
crevice
pauline
after
a
brief
hopeless
test
of
her
frail
strength
against
the
weight
of
the
granite
mass
moved
slowly
along
the
wall
to
the
extremity
of
the
chamber
here
about
seven
feet
from
the
floor
ran
a
ledge
of
rock
between
two
and
three
feet
in
width
and
from
this
ledge
upward
the
wall
slanted
at
an
angle
of
degrees
to
a
wide
shelf
or
fissure
it
was
from
this
fissure
that
the
faint
light
came
pauline
groped
her
way
back
along
the
other
wall
to
the
front
of
the
cave
again
despairing
she
sat
down
on
the
chill
stone
the
events
of
the
last
few
hours
had
left
her
in
a
state
of
mental
vertigo
the
of
the
buckboard
and
her
carrying
off
by
the
bandits
seemed
fantastically
impossible
so
this
was
her
escape
from
scenes
of
adventure
this
was
the
great
safe
quiet
west
where
she
should
forget
her
perils
in
new
york
and
wait
for
others
to
forget
them
she
thought
of
her
promise
to
harry
that
she
would
not
try
to
get
into
any
more
scrapes
in
her
former
dangers
even
when
there
seemed
hope
she
had
a
buoying
trust
that
there
was
one
man
who
could
save
her
he
had
always
saved
her
in
his
protecting
shelter
she
had
come
to
feel
almost
immune
from
harm
but
with
harry
three
thousand
miles
away
and
totally
ignorant
of
her
need
of
him
no
sense
of
imagined
protection
sustained
her
now
she
took
it
for
granted
that
haines
had
been
made
a
prisoner
or
killed
she
knew
the
word
would
reach
haines
and
the
latter
would
invoke
all
the
powers
in
the
state
to
find
her
but
she
was
sure
she
would
be
dead
before
anyone
unearthed
this
fearful
hiding
place
the
light
at
the
far
end
of
the
cave
grew
steadily
more
dim
and
pauline
judged
that
the
day
was
waning
a
rustling
sound
caught
her
ear
sounds
are
animate
or
inanimate
this
was
unmistakably
the
sound
of
a
living
thing
pauline
trembled
a
little
but
she
stood
up
was
it
man
or
beast
that
she
had
for
companion
in
the
mysterious
cave
she
took
a
faltering
step
forward
the
sound
seemed
to
come
nearer
the
cave
had
gone
almost
pitch
dark
and
suddenly
from
the
of
the
back
wall
from
the
rock
ledge
there
flashed
upon
the
sight
of
the
imprisoned
girl
two
beady
burning
eyes
chapter
xiv
the
great
white
queen
hal
haines
best
driving
team
was
lathered
with
foam
and
the
buckboard
swung
through
the
gate
on
two
wheels
as
bill
cabot
drove
back
to
the
double
cross
ranch
the
young
cowboy
whom
haines
had
ordered
to
carry
the
news
of
disaster
to
haines
seeing
the
buckboard
and
only
cabot
driving
knew
instantly
that
something
had
gone
wrong
what
is
it
will
she
called
running
down
to
the
gate
did
she
come
has
anything
happened
to
hal
she
was
held
up
and
carried
off
mrs
haines
i
know
i
know
you
played
the
joke
but
what
happened
she
looked
at
the
foaming
horses
what
made
you
drive
home
like
this
she
demanded
she
was
carried
off
by
us
haines
some
other
crowd
got
ahead
of
us
some
crowd
that
meant
what
they
was
doing
the
boss
and
the
boys
has
got
the
trail
by
this
time
i
guess
the
boss
said
i
should
come
and
tell
you
for
a
moment
haines
looked
at
him
in
doubt
is
this
another
joke
will
she
asked
there
has
been
a
in
this
section
for
ten
years
i
guess
the
jokin
is
all
knocked
out
all
of
us
answered
bill
turning
shamefacedly
away
no
this
is
the
truth
and
and
i
wish
the
boss
had
took
some
one
else
horse
instid
of
mine
never
mind
they
have
all
the
men
in
montana
out
to
find
that
girl
if
this
is
a
hoax
cried
haines
in
a
voice
that
choked
go
tell
the
other
boys
to
get
ready
the
sheriff
will
want
them
if
hal
does
she
sped
back
to
the
house
and
with
a
trembling
hand
rang
the
bell
of
the
telephone
that
furnished
a
new
blessing
to
the
ranches
a
moment
later
curt
sikes
the
telegraph
operator
at
rockvale
almost
fell
from
his
chair
as
he
took
the
following
message
over
the
wire
at
haines
dictation
harry
marvin
fifth
avenue
new
york
pauline
kidnapped
come
at
once
mary
haines
what
what
it
mean
mrs
haines
he
gasped
into
the
transmitter
it
ai
the
young
lady
that
hal
just
took
off
the
express
is
it
yes
that
who
it
is
curt
cabot
and
the
boys
are
coming
into
town
as
fast
as
they
can
ride
but
you
call
sheriff
hill
and
get
as
many
men
as
you
case
we
need
them
you
hurry
wo
you
curt
yes
and
i
get
your
message
right
on
the
wire
they
put
it
ahead
all
along
the
line
if
curt
speed
in
getting
the
telegram
away
was
inspired
partly
by
burning
need
of
telling
the
news
to
rockvale
that
did
not
reflect
on
curt
he
flashed
after
the
new
york
message
a
terse
call
up
and
down
the
line
to
find
the
sheriff
and
then
bolted
out
to
the
platform
his
shout
was
heard
not
only
at
the
little
hotel
across
the
street
from
the
station
but
at
the
city
limits
of
rockvale
a
good
mile
away
rockvale
answered
the
shout
as
a
clan
answering
the
beacozes
flare
when
curt
sikes
shouted
it
meant
news
his
messages
along
the
line
had
little
effect
he
had
spent
the
morning
flaunting
the
news
to
fellow
operators
and
rival
communities
that
the
express
had
stopped
at
rockvale
they
had
only
half
believed
that
and
now
this
added
flourish
was
too
much
even
sheriff
hill
whom
the
message
overtook
at
gatesburg
fifteen
miles
south
laughed
when
he
read
it
and
started
for
rockvale
only
because
he
was
going
there
anyway
to
get
case
egan
there
ai
much
doubt
which
is
now
our
leadin
city
butte
or
rockvale
he
remarked
as
he
swung
to
his
saddle
and
set
off
with
two
deputies
he
found
something
more
than
overdone
home
town
pride
in
rockvale
however
the
narrow
streets
were
filled
with
men
women
and
curious
children
horses
packed
for
long
riding
with
rifles
bolstered
to
the
saddles
were
tied
all
along
the
rails
of
both
the
main
hotel
and
the
station
curt
sikes
was
the
center
of
a
changing
but
ever
interested
group
but
two
of
the
haines
posse
who
had
just
come
in
without
any
report
of
capture
but
with
all
the
vivid
news
of
the
were
now
the
main
objects
of
attention
briefly
they
told
the
story
of
the
pursuit
with
haines
leading
they
had
struck
a
trail
that
took
them
to
the
river
they
had
waded
the
river
and
found
no
trail
on
the
other
side
knowing
the
bandits
had
taken
to
the
middle
of
the
stream
haines
had
divided
his
party
he
sent
two
men
down
stream
one
on
each
side
and
he
and
the
three
others
rode
up
stream
two
on
each
side
after
long
rough
riding
haines
had
found
a
trail
coming
out
of
the
water
all
four
had
followed
it
a
long
way
there
were
three
bandits
making
the
trail
but
the
three
stopped
and
each
took
a
different
direction
one
straight
up
into
the
hills
one
straight
down
into
the
valley
and
the
other
off
here
towards
town
haines
and
one
man
had
started
on
the
trail
to
the
hills
the
other
two
the
two
talking
now
had
each
taken
one
of
the
other
trails
but
had
lost
them
they
thought
haines
would
lose
his
too
it
had
been
a
clean
expert
piece
of
work
this
kidnapping
the
getaway
had
been
a
work
of
art
just
as
the
had
been
a
of
stage
setting
you
saw
all
the
gang
that
held
you
up

the
sheriff

lot

said
the
sheriff
quietly
i

some
fast
work
against

red
snake

of
these
days

trouble
sheriff
oh
just
one
of
their
devils
brewing
bad
medicine
again
up
at
village
red
snake
always
was
a
little
bit
crazy
talking
about
the
thieving
white
man
that
stole
his
country
and
looking
for
a
chance
to
get
the
rest
of
his
people
killed
off
i
heard
that
down
at
hallick
last
week
drawled
a
man
in
the
crowd

sioux
is
only
waitin
for
the
great
white
queen
to
come
out
o
the
heart
o
the
airth

lead
on
the
warpath
they
got
a
plenty
o
arms
too
for
reservation
injuns

that
sheriff
the
sheriff
nodded
slowly
i
wish
haines
would
get
in
he
said
i
like
to
have
a
talk
with
him
before
we
start
but
it
getting
late
the
dull
thudding
of
tired
horses
hoofs
from
the
other
side
of
the
hill
below
town
came
to
him
as
an
answer
presently
haines
and
his
companion
joined
silently
the
eager
crowd
at
the
station
the
owner
of
the
double
cross
seemed
to
have
aged
ten
years
since
he
had
driven
away
with
pauline
from
that
same
station
platform
only
a
few
hours
before
he
would
have
given
all
the
acres
of
the
double
cross
for
just
a
word
about
pauline
he
would
have
given
his
life
to
know
that
she
was
alive
there
nothing
for
it
sheriff
but
to
rake
the
whole
country
he
said
wearily
they
hidden
her
somewheres
if
they
have
killed
her
and
if
they
killed
her
mind
it
me
you
to
hang
for
it
the
sheriff
laid
a
strong
hand
on
his
old
friend
shoulder
i
can
get
the
state
militia
out
to
look
for
that
girl
hal
he
said
by
the
way
is
there
anything
anything
queer
about
her
he
asked
what
do
you
mean
why
only
that
her
folks
have
been
writing
to
the
governor
at
helena
sikes
just
gave
me
this
from
governor
casson
himself
who
is
this
raymond
owen
who
been
wiring
to
the
governor
that
her
guardian
i
think
h
mused
haines
as
he
read
the
message
that
is
queer
i
wish
they
have
wired
me
that
yesterday
the
sheriff
folded
the
telegram
and
putting
it
back
in
his
pocket
stepped
up
on
a
box
near
the
hotel
door
i
want
to
call
for
a
hundred
volunteer
citizens
to
go
hunt
this
girl
he
announced
a
minute
later
all
that
was
left
of
rockvale
was
the
buildings
and
the
women
children
and
old
men
who
stood
watching
a
cloud
of
dust
blotting
the
sunset
glow
and
listening
to
the
retreating
clatter
of
a
flying
cavalcade
sikes
kept
the
office
open
late
at
he
telephoned
to
haines
at
the
double
cross
what
does
he
say
she
cried
just
one
word
comin
said
curt
in
an
aggrieved
voice
he
could
sent
ten
words
fer
the
same
price
he
grumbled
red
snake
was
one
of
the
younger
chiefs
of
the
sioux
he
was
too
young
to
have
had
a
share
in
the
bloody
last
stand
of
his
race
in
their
montana
wilderness
but
he
was
old
enough
to
have
watched
the
dwindling
of
spirit
and
power
among
them
for
twenty
years
and
every
day
of
watching
kindled
new
hate
in
the
breast
of
the
indian
in
him
the
spirit
of
his
fathers
had
left
the
old
unquenchable
belief
in
the
day
of
restoration
when
by
some
supernatural
intervention
the
indians
would
return
to
their
lands
the
lands
revert
to
their
primeval
state
and
civilization
be
lost
in
the
obliterating
wilderness
the
officers
of
the
agency
had
had
trouble
with
red
snake
on
several
occasions
twice
he
had
started
out
at
the
head
of
war
parties
and
had
been
caught
just
in
time
to
prevent
bloodshed
among
the
isolated
settlers
but
of
late
he
had
been
docile
and
peaceful
the
new
disturbances
the
occasional
shooting
of
a
cowboy
and
the
petty
stealing
of
cattle
dated
from
the
beginning
of
the
sway
of
a
new
medicine
man
in
red
snake
principal
village
of
his
name
was
of
many
syllables
in
the
native
language
but
he
was
known
as
big
smoke
he
was
a
young
indian
who
had
spent
some
years
among
the
whites
in
the
southwest
had
made
a
pretense
at
getting
an
education
but
had
reverted
violently
to
the
life
and
faith
of
his
fathers
big
smoke
had
predicted
to
red
snake
the
coming
of
the
great
white
queen
who
would
empower
the
arms
of
the
red
man
to
overthrow
the
whites
and
would
make
him
again
master
of
his
rightful
lands
red
snake
squatted
on
a
blanket
beside
his
teepee
listened
with
immobile
features
but
with
a
thrilled
heart
he
summoned
a
council
of
the
chiefs
secretly
and
the
medicine
man
addressed
his
message
to
them
also
thereafter
the
indians
of
were
restive
their
growing
spirit
of
rebellion
manifested
itself
in
foolish
little
offenses
against
the
white
men
these
were
punished
with
the
white
customary
sternness
and
this
increased
the
rancor
of
the
indians
it
increased
too
their
eagerness
for
the
fulfillment
of
the
strange
prophecy
of
the
coming
of
the
white
queen
on
the
very
day
when
the
white
man
village
of
rockvale
was
in
a
hubbub
of
excitement
because
of
the
kidnapping
of
pauline
the
village
of
was
tumultuous
with
a
different
fervor
into
the
circle
of
the
assembled
chiefs
rimmed
with
awed
faces
of
squaws
and
papooses
had
danced
the
weird
figure
of
big
smoke
he
had
been
called
upon
by
red
snake
to
announce
what
further
of
the
white
queen
his
medicine
had
revealed
big
smoke
wore
the
head
of
a
wolf
with
cow
horns
set
over
the
ears
his
lithe
red
body
was
covered
with
a
long
bear
skin
his
legs
were
bare
to
the
tops
of
his
gaily
beaded
moccasins
he
circled
the
silent
group
with
fantastic
gyrations
and
stopped
finally
in
the
center
lifting
his
hands
he
addressed
the
tribe
first
in
glowing
rhetoric
he
pictured
the
ancient
glory
of
the
sioux
their
wealth
in
lands
their
prowess
in
the
hunt
their
triumph
over
all
other
red
men
he
told
of
their
long
and
brave
struggle
with
the
white
man
who
by
the
intervention
of
wicked
gods
had
been
enabled
to
conquer
them
but
the
time
of
vengeance
and
retribution
had
come
after
long
years
the
indian
was
to
return
to
his
own
the
great
spirit
is
sending
us
a
leader
said
rig
smoke
the
great
spirit
has
spoken
to
me
and
said
i
will
send
a
white
queen
with
golden
hair
she
shall
come
from
the
heart
of
the
earth
and
she
shall
lead
your
warriors
against
the
oppressor
this
was
the
third
time
big
smoke
had
said
this
that
was
what
made
it
most
impressive
to
the
listeners
big
smoke
had
staked
not
only
his
reputation
as
a
medicine
man
but
also
his
life
upon
this
wonderful
prediction
which
had
aroused
his
people
as
they
had
not
been
aroused
in
fifty
years
for
it
was
the
law
of
the
ancient
code
that
fulfillment
must
follow
immediately
the
third
announcement
of
the
miracle
if
fulfillment
failed
there
remained
only
the
great
death
stone
in
the
valley
no
prophet
of
the
tribe
had
ever
won
in
the
race
with
the
death
stone
and
so
the
chiefs
sat
in
respectful
silence
and
the
young
braves
arose
eager
for
the
war
dance
when
big
smoke
finished
speaking
the
dance
beginning
slowly
waxed
wilder
the
beat
more
vibrantly
until
the
whole
village
was
encircled
by
the
painted
and
bonneted
tribesmen
the
red
glare
of
daylight
fires
illuminated
the
wild
faces
the
women
cowered
with
their
children
beside
the
teepees
in
the
midst
of
the
tumult
the
medicine
man
stood
with
hands
stretched
upward
calling
on
the
great
spirit
to
send
the
white
queen
when
the
dance
had
subsided
the
council
resumed
its
deliberations
it
was
arranged
that
there
should
be
a
hunt
that
afternoon
and
the
foxes
or
coyotes
should
be
driven
as
near
as
possible
to
the
settlements
this
would
be
a
means
of
reconnoitering
and
it
would
make
the
whites
think
the
indians
were
engaged
in
peaceful
pursuits
pauline
after
her
first
startled
cry
stood
spellbound
by
the
two
glowing
eyes
that
shone
from
the
far
end
of
the
cave
there
was
no
light
now
save
for
the
eyes
the
rift
in
the
roof
from
which
the
mysterious
glow
had
come
seemed
to
have
been
closed
suddenly
the
pitch
darkness
made
the
eyes
doubly
terrible
and
just
perceptibly
they
moved
and
flashed
which
showed
they
were
living
eyes
pauline
longed
to
scream
but
could
not
behind
those
fiery
points
imagination
could
picture
all
manner
of
horrible
shapes
was
the
creature
about
to
spring
upon
her
the
eyes
vanished
as
suddenly
as
they
had
appeared
the
low
rustling
sound
came
again
then
the
utter
silence
pauline
freed
of
the
uncanny
gaze
was
able
to
think
and
act
if
that
animal
could
find
its
way
into
her
prison
house
there
must
be
another
entrance
to
the
cave
it
was
plain
that
the
animal
had
been
crouching
on
the
slant
rock
above
the
ledge
pauline
began
again
to
grope
around
the
wall
she
could
touch
the
top
of
the
ledge
and
now
in
several
places
she
found
small
crevices
in
the
wall
by
which
she
tried
to
climb
time
and
again
she
fell
back
her
soft
hands
were
torn
by
the
jagged
rock
her
dress
was
in
shreds
her
golden
hair
fell
down
upon
her
shoulders
she
might
have
been
some
preternatural
dweller
of
the
place
at
last
her
foot
held
firm
in
a
crevice
three
feet
above
the
floor
clutching
the
she
groped
for
another
step
and
found
it
in
a
moment
she
was
on
the
ledge
she
sank
there
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
the
eyes
had
blazed
again
scarcely
three
feet
away
she
felt
the
breath
of
hot
nostrils
the
rough
hair
of
a
beast
as
the
thing
sprang
she
felt
that
the
end
had
come
but
she
still
clung
to
the
ledge
as
she
uncovered
her
eyes
slowly
she
was
astonished
to
see
that
the
faint
light
had
returned
it
came
as
she
had
thought
over
a
concealed
shelf
of
stone
above
the
rocky
incline
the
eyes
had
vanished
the
cave
was
still
she
began
to
scale
the
incline
her
hands
and
feet
caught
nubs
and
slits
of
the
surface
and
a
little
higher
she
felt
the
cool
dampness
of
earth
and
grasped
the
root
of
a
tree
as
she
drew
herself
up
she
looked
over
the
shelf
and
saw
at
one
end
of
it
the
open
day
she
crawled
a
little
way
upon
the
shelf
then
stopped
she
hardly
dared
to
go
on
what
if
the
opening
large
enough
to
admit
the
light
were
too
small
for
her
to
pass
through
what
if
the
light
had
been
only
a
lure
to
torture
her
what
if
she
must
return
into
the
darkness
with
that
thing
unknown
the
thing
with
the
blazing
eyes
she
crept
on
with
her
eyes
shut
a
stronger
glow
of
light
upon
the
closed
lids
told
her
she
had
reached
the
end
of
the
shelving
the
next
moment
would
tell
her
if
she
had
reached
freedom
or
renewed
captivity
she
looked
up
three
of
red
snake
young
warriors
had
gained
most
of
the
plaudits
of
the
village
during
the
afternoon
of
the
hunt
they
rode
together
and
not
only
did
they
bring
in
many
foxes
and
coyotes
but
much
news
of
the
white
people
they
had
met
armed
men
throughout
all
the
mountain
country
riding
up
and
down
the
river
the
armed
men
had
greeted
them
fairly
and
had
asked
them
for
information
of
other
white
men
who
had
stolen
a
girl
and
carried
her
away
the
white
men
were
thus
fighting
among
themselves
it
was
a
propitious
time
for
the
coining
of
the
new
queen
these
three
young
men
about
five
in
the
afternoon
had
just
started
the
drive
of
a
coyote
towards
the
level
country
when
the
quarry
doubled
suddenly
and
turned
into
the
hills
with
shouts
and
shots
the
indians
pursued
it
but
their
horses
were
no
match
for
it
on
the
devious
wooded
paths
and
grunting
their
disgust
they
saw
it
dive
into
a
burrow
in
a
rocky
hollow
of
the
cliff
they
dismounted
and
stood
about
the
mouth
of
the
burrow
grumbling
and
cursing
their
luck
in
an
ancient
tongue
at
last
two
of
them
mounted
and
started
to
ride
away
and
their
companion
followed
slowly
leading
his
horse
a
sound
made
him
turn
his
head
with
a
cry
of
mingled
fear
and
joy
of
awe
and
triumph
he
threw
himself
prostrate
before
the
mouth
of
the
burrow
the
other
indians
dashed
back
they
literally
fell
from
their
horses
to
the
feet
of
the
wonderful
being
who
had
risen
from
the
heart
of
the
earth
the
promised
goddess
who
would
lead
them
against
the
oppressors
in
the
poor
disheveled
person
of
pauline
coming
from
her
prison
cave
they
saw
their
great
white
queen
chapter
xv
the
death
stone
as
the
thrilled
and
frightened
indian
lay
prostrate
at
her
feet
he
might
well
have
believed
her
to
be
some
creature
from
another
world
her
face
was
very
pale
and
round
it
fell
in
tumultuous
glory
the
cascades
of
her
golden
hair
her
dress
was
torn
to
shreds
by
the
jagged
rocks
and
there
was
blood
upon
the
delicate
hands
that
she
held
out
in
pleading
to
the
only
living
thing
she
red
man
he
did
not
move
she
stepped
nearer
and
stooping
gently
touched
his
shoulder
at
the
touch
he
trembled
like
a
leaf
but
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
her
with
terror
and
awe
and
adoration
in
his
eyes
wo
you
help
me
i
have
ben
a
prisoner
in
the
cave
i
must
find
haines
haines
do
you
hear
or
go
to
rockvale
rockvale
she
repeated
hoping
that
the
names
at
least
he
might
understand
he
motioned
questioningly
toward
his
horse
and
at
her
nod
he
sprang
up
and
brought
the
animal
to
her
side
helping
her
to
mount
he
took
the
bridle
and
began
to
lead
the
way
into
the
thickly
wooded
hills
the
journey
was
slow
and
arduous
but
it
was
not
long
darkness
had
not
yet
fallen
when
the
hill
trail
dipped
into
a
valley
and
weary
hopeful
eyes
looked
down
upon
a
village
on
the
plain
the
hope
vanished
quickly
as
she
realized
that
the
houses
of
the
village
were
teepees
and
that
the
people
that
moved
among
them
were
braves
and
squaws
an
indian
boy
of
perhaps
twelve
years
sprang
suddenly
from
a
thicket
beside
the
trail
gave
one
glance
at
her
and
with
a
shriek
set
off
at
full
speed
toward
the
teepees
cries
sounded
and
resounded
from
the
hills
were
beating
she
became
aware
that
the
indians
were
swarming
about
her
and
acclaiming
her
a
guest
of
unusual
honor
they
stopped
her
horse
at
the
entrance
to
red
snake
teepee
the
great
chief
stepped
forth
himself
with
big
smoke
the
medicine
man
close
behind
him
the
prophet
who
had
foretold
the
coming
of
the
great
white
queen
wore
a
mien
of
pride
and
triumph
even
as
he
bowed
low
before
pauline
but
of
all
the
red
folk
in
village
big
smoke
was
undoubtedly
the
most
amazed
at
the
fulfillment
of
his
prophecy
the
braves
who
were
assigned
to
lift
pauline
from
her
horse
and
bear
her
into
the
chief
teepee
were
surprised
that
one
immortal
should
be
so
weak
as
almost
to
fall
into
their
arms
so
weary
as
to
be
scarcely
able
to
walk
but
pauline
seated
upon
a
high
pile
of
furs
within
the
teepee
where
the
weird
light
of
a
fire
fell
upon
her
pallid
features
and
her
flowing
hair
presented
a
picture
strange
and
marvelous
they
gathered
around
her
red
snake
and
the
medicine
man
in
the
center
of
the
adobe
the
lesser
chiefs
behind
them
and
in
another
circle
the
ranks
of
the
braves
even
in
her
utter
exhaustion
the
savage
solemnity
of
the
gathering
fascinated
pauline
had
she
been
left
alone
she
would
have
fallen
asleep
upon
the
piled
furs
but
this
low
muttering
assemblage
of
the
red
men
forced
her
to
respectful
attention
that
they
honored
her
she
understood
but
she
saw
too
that
the
indians
were
all
armed
and
some
of
them
were
painted
as
red
snake
arose
to
address
the
tribe
a
menacing
murmur
filled
the
teepee
and
the
young
chiefs
whetted
their
knives
upon
the
ground
red
snake
harangue
unintelligible
to
pauline
had
an
electrical
effect
upon
the
indians
frequently
as
he
spoke
he
turned
toward
her
and
always
when
he
did
so
he
bent
his
head
upon
his
breast
and
raised
his
mighty
arms
in
token
of
submission
to
a
power
mightier
than
his
own
as
he
finished
pauline
arose
swaying
a
little
from
her
great
weakness
she
shook
her
head
in
token
that
she
did
not
understand
her
outstretched
pleading
hands
bewildered
but
subdued
the
warlike
assembly
red
snake
called
a
ringing
summons
and
from
the
rear
circle
of
the
audience
shuffled
forward
the
strangest
man
pauline
had
ever
seen
his
undersized
stooping
form
was
garbed
in
a
miner
red
shirt
a
ranchman
a
pair
of
tattered
moccasins
and
a
derby
hat
with
a
lone
feather
in
the
band
of
it
it
was
white
hat
a
interpreter
as
he
approached
cringing
and
bowing
pauline
noted
that
a
penetrating
not
unkindly
eye
gleamed
from
under
his
bushy
brow
scrutinizing
her
in
flashes
between
his
obeisances
unlike
the
other
indians
he
was
not
afraid
to
look
the
great
white
queen
in
the
face
as
he
solemnly
repeated
the
last
words
of
red
snake
according
to
the
prophecy
you
have
come
from
the
heart
of
the
world
to
lead
us
against
those
who
steal
our
land
pauline
stood
for
a
moment
in
complete
bewilderment
then
as
the
meaning
of
the
words
with
the
meaning
of
the
strange
gathering
flashed
upon
her
mind
she
took
a
step
forward
speaking
in
earnest
protest
but
she
spoke
only
to
the
chief
for
the
indians
had
broken
all
restraint
and
were
crushing
their
way
out
of
the
teepee
with
cries
and
brandishing
of
weapons
they
swept
the
little
interpreter
with
them
and
red
snake
saw
in
pauline
look
and
tone
of
appeal
only
the
pleading
of
a
wronged
goddess
for
vengeance
upon
her
enemies
he
called
the
women
of
his
household
who
shyly
led
the
queen
away
darkness
had
fallen
as
the
women
glided
ahead
of
her
to
a
spot
outside
the
main
village
where
a
spacious
teepee
had
been
erected
apart
only
a
peaceful
moon
and
a
firmament
glittering
with
stars
lighted
their
path
but
from
the
town
behind
came
terrifying
yells
the
rattle
of
and
occasionally
a
rifle
shot
as
the
braves
prepared
their
spirits
for
the
test
of
battle
pauline
found
her
new
home
filled
with
all
the
luxuries
and
sacred
relics
of
the
tribe
there
were
rugs
richer
than
those
in
the
chief
house
the
walls
were
festooned
with
strung
beads
and
on
the
large
low
couch
of
bear
skins
lay
the
most
splendid
of
indian
raiment
the
women
with
better
understanding
than
men
of
the
earthly
needs
of
immortals
made
her
lie
down
while
they
bathed
her
aching
temples
and
wounded
hands
replaced
her
torn
garments
with
a
gorgeous
blanket
robe
and
smoothed
her
flying
tresses
into
long
comfortable
braids
other
women
came
bringing
food
and
there
was
a
pipe
and
a
pouch
of
agency
tobacco
with
which
the
goddess
might
soothe
the
hours
before
repose
pauline
ate
eagerly
while
the
women
looked
oil
in
silent
approval
when
she
had
finished
she
arose
smiling
and
signed
to
them
that
she
would
rest
they
left
softly
and
neither
the
exciting
recollections
of
the
day
adventures
nor
the
tumult
of
the
braves
outside
could
hold
her
for
a
moment
longer
from
the
blessedness
of
sleep
she
slept
far
into
the
next
morning
but
so
did
the
village
for
the
indians
had
reveled
to
exhaustion
it
was
nearly
noon
before
she
attired
herself
in
a
fringed
and
beaded
dress
of
buckskin
with
leggings
and
exquisite
little
moccasins
and
laughingly
permitted
one
of
the
women
attendants
to
place
a
painted
war
feather
in
her
hair
thus
clad
and
with
her
wide
braids
falling
she
sat
regally
to
receive
the
morning
call
of
red
snake
she
was
beginning
to
take
a
tremulous
pleasure
in
the
game
of
being
an
immortal
pauline
questing
spirit
was
too
happy
in
adventure
not
to
find
a
thrill
in
being
thus
translated
from
hungering
captive
to
reigning
queen
from
queen
to
angel
red
snake
call
was
formal
and
politely
brief
he
brought
with
him
the
amusing
interpreter
to
inquire
if
the
spirit
had
found
comfort
in
the
hospitality
of
his
people
and
more
particularly
if
the
war
dance
of
the
preceding
night
had
given
her
satisfaction
pauline
replied
with
gracious
solemnity
that
her
spirit
had
found
good
repose
and
had
been
comforted
by
the
pleasant
music
and
when
will
the
white
queen
lead
us
against
our
enemies
the
men
of
her
own
color
but
not
of
her
kind
inquired
the
chief
with
eagerness
pauline
hesitated
an
instant
after
the
interpreter
repeated
the
question
then
recovering
herself
she
answered
gravely
today
red
snake
the
queen
rests
from
her
long
journey
out
of
the
happy
hunting
ground
tomorrow
also
upon
the
next
day
perhaps
she
will
lead
the
warriors
the
little
interpreter
keen
eyes
flashed
understandingly
as
he
left
out
the
word
perhaps
in
repeating
her
answer
red
snake
was
elated
he
made
profound
salutations
promised
that
the
war
party
would
do
her
honor
and
hastened
away
to
announce
the
news
the
interpreter
lingered
pretending
to
smooth
the
door
rug
he
looked
up
suddenly
and
his
eyes
met
pauline
with
an
expression
of
friendly
interest
instinctively
she
accepted
the
tacitly
offered
friendship
you
are
a
white
man
you
speak
english
she
said
part
white
part
red
you
speak
all
white
he
added
significantly
of
course
she
whispered
stepping
to
his
side
i
am
not
a
queen
not
a
spirit
i
do
not
know
why
they
believe
i
am
but
i
must
get
away
to
rockvale
to
haines
ranch
to
the
white
people
anywhere
you
will
help
me
he
looked
at
her
pityingly
now
he
had
believed
that
she
was
an
accomplice
of
the
medicine
man
in
a
shrewd
fraud
and
he
had
merely
wanted
to
share
the
joke
risky
as
it
was
to
find
her
an
accidental
and
unwilling
monarch
struck
him
dumb
that
is
very
hard
he
said
slowly
look
he
parted
the
folds
of
the
teepee
door
curtain
so
that
she
looked
out
toward
the
village
three
women
sat
next
the
door
and
beyond
were
groups
of
braves
still
in
their
war
paint
some
conversing
some
stalwart
and
still
they
seemed
to
be
doing
nothing
in
particular
well
questioned
pauline
he
led
her
across
the
teepee
to
a
narrow
slit
in
the
rear
curtain
through
this
she
peered
as
she
had
peered
through
the
door
and
saw
exactly
what
she
had
seen
though
the
door
women
crouching
at
their
tasks
in
the
near
foreground
an
armed
circle
of
warriors
beyond
now
she
understood
i
am
a
prisoner
then
they
will
guard
you
night
and
day
why
it
was
prophesied
that
a
great
white
queen
would
come
to
lead
them
to
battle
you
have
come
as
the
prophet
said
and
you
have
promised
to
lead
them
to
battle
above
all
be
proud
and
not
afraid
the
ioterpreter
hesitated
a
moment
there
was
another
white
queen
whose
coming
was
prophesied
many
hundreds
of
years
ago
he
said
she
came
she
led
the
indians
victory
over
other
indians
and
then
she
vanished
in
the
strangest
way
i
would
tell
you
of
it
but
i
am
afraid
they
say
her
spirit
is
always
near
some
day
you
may
know
how
she
vanished
before
she
could
speak
again
he
had
glided
out
of
the
teepee
while
pauline
was
away
harry
had
planned
to
accomplish
mighty
labors
with
masculine
fatuity
he
let
himself
believe
before
she
went
away
that
a
man
can
get
more
work
done
with
his
goddess
afar
than
when
cupid
has
a
desk
in
his
office
it
did
not
take
more
than
hours
to
turn
separation
into
bereavement
not
more
than
to
turn
his
freedom
for
work
into
slavery
to
the
fidgets
the
office
instead
of
a
refuge
became
a
prison
to
him
however
he
made
a
pretense
of
sticking
to
the
grind
and
it
was
not
until
the
thursday
on
which
his
chartings
showed
pauline
would
arrive
at
rockvale
that
he
actually
quit
and
went
home
he
slipped
into
the
library
to
be
alone
it
was
more
restful
here
as
he
sat
in
the
great
leather
chair
and
unfolded
a
newspaper
the
portrait
of
pauline
smiled
brightly
down
at
him
in
seeming
camaraderie
at
his
side
stood
the
mummy
so
intimately
associated
with
her
and
his
dead
father
strange
vision
from
the
tomb
harry
began
to
read
but
he
was
still
nervous
to
the
point
of
excitement
and
his
thoughts
wandered
from
the
words
he
was
suddenly
conscious
of
another
presence
in
the
room
he
let
the
paper
fall
and
gazed
intently
at
the
portrait
but
a
moment
later
harry
marvin
sprang
excitedly
from
the
chair
and
fairly
leaped
towards
the
picture
from
somewhere
out
of
the
dim
air
of
the
library
a
hand
had
reached
and
touched
his
it
had
touched
his
shoulder
and
then
with
a
commanding
finger
had
pointed
upward
at
the
picture
on
the
wall
the
mummy
it
has
warned
again
gasped
harry
polly
polly
he
cried
to
the
portrait
i
coming
just
hold
on
he
strode
bark
to
the
table
and
pressed
a
bell
tell
reynolds
to
pack
me
up
bemis
he
charged
the
astonished
butler
tell
him
it
for
montana
in
a
rush
have
a
machine
ready
for
me
in
fifteen
minutes
even
bemis
constitutional
aversion
to
haste
was
overridden
he
sped
into
the
hall
calling
to
the
valet
as
harry
picked
up
a
telephone
hello
this
is
marvin
i
want
our
private
car
attached
to
the
chicago
flyer
he
said
no
matter
if
it
holds
up
the
flyer
have
president
grigsby
authorization
in
your
hands
in
five
minutes
thank
you
goodbye
as
he
reached
the
door
of
the
machine
a
messenger
boy
turned
up
the
steps
harry
called
to
him
took
the
telegram
and
read
message
pauline
kidnapped
come
at
once
with
a
muffled
ejaculation
he
dropped
the
slip
of
paper
and
sprang
into
the
car
which
in
ten
minutes
pulled
up
to
the
station
just
as
the
disgruntled
but
curious
trainmen
were
coupling
the
luxurious
marvinia
to
the
express
owen
coming
quietly
down
the
steps
of
the
marvin
house
picked
up
the
telegram
which
harry
had
let
fall
reading
it
he
smiled
and
he
was
still
smiling
when
another
messenger
boy
followed
him
to
the
door
owen
took
the
second
message
and
the
smile
broadened
into
an
ugly
grin
as
he
read
raymond

york
all
well
hicks
five
days
after
the
disappearance
of
pauline
the
express
stopped
again
at
rockvale
station
as
harry
swung
from
the
rear
step
to
the
dingy
platform
there
were
many
curious
eyes
to
observe
his
arrival
but
the
watchers
were
mostly
women
and
children
the
men
of
rockvale
were
still
out
on
the
long
hunt
for
pauline
harry
hurried
first
to
the
station
telephone
sikes
had
got
haines
on
the
wire
as
soon
as
the
smoke
of
the
express
had
been
sighted
ten
miles
away
but
all
she
could
tell
harry
was
that
there
was
nothing
to
tell
his
lips
were
set
in
a
hard
line
as
he
hung
up
the
receiver
he
asked
a
few
hasty
questions
of
sikes
hurried
across
to
the
little
hotel
paid
for
a
room
and
hired
a
horse
blankets
and
provisions
strapped
behind
he
was
out
and
away
up
the
road
to
the
mountains
within
an
hour
and
while
he
urged
his
sturdy
little
mount
to
better
speed
on
his
uncharted
journey
pauline
not
twenty
miles
away
was
preparing
for
the
last
journey
she
might
ever
make
the
blow
had
fallen
her
royal
place
her
immortal
power
had
vanished
the
indians
had
permitted
one
postponement
of
the
day
of
battle
she
had
said
that
the
spirits
had
spoken
to
her
and
warned
against
bloodshed
upon
that
day
it
should
be
the
second
day
thereafter
the
spirits
had
said
the
indians
were
disappointed
but
they
bowed
to
the
edict
the
morrow
passed
quietly
but
on
the
next
day
the
fifth
of
her
royal
captivity
she
was
summoned
from
her
house
by
the
assembled
chiefs
in
battle
paint
and
feathers
she
tried
to
whisper
through
the
doorway
that
the
spirits
had
forbidden
again
but
red
snake
answered
you
are
greater
than
all
other
spirits
you
will
lead
us
today
tell
them
said
pauline
to
the
interpreter
that
the
white
queen
does
not
lead
today
red
snake
his
face
black
with
anger
after
haranguing
the
chiefs
turned
to
pauline
daughter
of
the
earth
twice
our
warriors
have
been
ready
for
battle
and
you
would
not
lead
them
today
you
must
go
before
the
oracle
and
prove
your
immortality
the
oracle
will
tell
the
warriors
departed
only
the
little
interpreter
remained
what
does
it
mean
cried
pauline
it
is
the
race
with
the
great
death
stone
he
answered
and
his
own
voice
trembled
but
he
whispered
i
will
ride
i
will
try
to
find
help
wait
he
slipped
under
the
back
of
the
teepee
unseen
by
the
excited
indians
he
made
his
way
to
the
line
of
ponies
with
lariats
and
rifles
swung
from
their
saddles
he
picked
one
and
mounting
rode
slowly
out
of
the
village
speaking
here
and
there
to
the
braves
he
met
pauline
left
alone
fell
upon
her
knees
and
prayed
harry
met
haines
and
two
of
his
posse
on
the
road
to
the
mountains
they
were
on
their
way
back
to
a
general
rendezvous
ordered
by
the
sheriff
but
harry
continued
on
his
way
up
the
mountain
mile
after
mile
the
little
mustang
put
behind
him
while
the
sun
was
still
high
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
they
came
to
a
crossroads
and
harry
riding
almost
blindly
reined
to
the
right
the
pony
swerved
wildly
to
the
left
instinctively
harry
gave
the
frightened
horse
its
head
a
half
mile
farther
on
the
animal
stopped
and
sniffed
the
wind
at
the
same
instant
harry
heard
a
feeble
shout
from
the
road
a
weirdly
garbed
little
half
breed
lay
on
the
ground
holding
the
bridle
of
the
horse
that
had
thrown
him
ankle
gone
he
explained
riding
for
help
i
help
was
you
ride
now
white
girl
they
killing
her
up
there
now
white
girl
where
talk
fast
man
two
miles
over
the
mountain
and
down
to
the
valley
straight
ahead
you
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
valley
not
to
the
top
not
where
the
indians
are
climb
tree
take
my
rope
it
the
only
chance
now
harry
caught
the
coiled
lariat
from
the
other
saddle
and
rode
as
he
had
never
ridden
before
all
was
vague
in
his
mind
except
that
pauline
was
near
was
in
peril
and
he
must
reach
her
how
by
road
and
trail
he
ever
reached
the
valley
of
the
death
stone
harry
never
knew
perhaps
chance
perhaps
some
invisible
courier
guided
him
to
the
lonely
spot
after
long
hard
riding
he
was
attracted
by
the
low
rumble
of
many
voices
lifted
in
a
sort
of
chant
following
the
voices
he
came
to
the
foot
of
a
steep
cliff
side
where
a
long
trench
partly
of
natural
formation
partly
hewn
from
the
stone
made
a
chute
or
runway
from
mountain
top
to
valley
at
the
upper
end
of
the
runway
a
motley
band
of
indians
were
engaged
in
some
weird
worship
harry
started
his
horse
up
the
steep
in
the
shelter
of
the
woods
when
he
came
to
a
spot
where
a
huge
tree
limb
crossed
the
runway
he
remembered
the
little
half
breed
words
climb
the
tree
it
is
the
only
chance
almost
at
the
same
instant
from
the
midst
of
the
indian
group
emerged
two
giant
braves
carrying
a
white
woman
between
them
they
placed
her
in
the
runway
her
golden
hair
unbound
floated
on
the
wind
harry
choked
back
a
cry
threw
aside
his
rifle
caught
the
lariat
and
swinging
up
the
tree
crawled
swiftly
out
on
the
overhanging
limb
concealed
by
the
foliage
he
waited
a
rifle
cracked
and
for
the
first
time
he
saw
that
at
the
top
of
the
runway
behind
pauline
the
stood
a
mighty
boulder
almost
perfectly
round
the
diameter
of
which
about
five
feet
fitted
the
trench
so
well
that
it
could
roll
in
it
like
a
ball
in
a
bowling
gutter
none
even
among
the
indians
knew
how
many
times
the
stone
of
death
had
rolled
and
been
dragged
back
again
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
the
stains
upon
it
were
unnumbered
up
on
its
surface
was
written
in
blood
the
doom
of
the
false
prophets
and
pretending
immortals
none
had
ever
won
in
the
race
with
the
death
stone
the
crack
of
the
rifle
was
the
signal
for
a
group
of
red
men
to
press
behind
the
stone
to
free
it
on
its
fearful
course
it
was
also
the
signal
for
pauline
to
run
her
hair
streamed
wildly
in
the
wind
as
she
sped
like
a
frightened
deer
down
the
deadly
path
the
rifle
sounded
again
and
the
indians
heaved
the
stone
into
the
trench
it
rumbled
as
it
came
on
it
gained
upon
the
fleeing
girl
they
had
planned
to
prolong
the
torture
by
giving
her
a
hopeless
lead
dancing
gesticulating
shouting
the
indians
watched
the
race
only
one
watcher
was
silent
and
motionless
hidden
by
the
leaves
he
braced
himself
upon
the
tree
limb
for
the
first
moments
after
the
rock
was
released
he
had
turned
sick
and
dizzy
now
as
they
came
near
the
thing
relentless
but
inanimate
pursuing
the
thing
helpless
beautiful
and
most
precious
to
him
of
all
things
in
the
world
not
the
quiver
of
a
muscle
hindered
the
desperate
task
that
he
had
set
himself
a
moment
later
he
was
sobbing
like
a
child
as
he
half
dragged
half
carried
pauline
to
his
waiting
horse
by
the
magic
of
luck
by
the
mystery
of
a
protecting
fate
the
lariat
noose
had
fallen
about
her
shoulders
to
the
amazed
and
terrified
indians
up
the
cliff
she
had
soared
suddenly
out
of
the
trench
and
vanished
in
the
foliage
of
the
tree
while
the
boulder
thundered
on
cheated
of
its
prey
but
swiftly
out
of
the
woods
upon
the
open
plain
below
appeared
a
rider
with
a
woman
clasped
before
him
on
the
saddle
the
baffled
indians
scurried
for
their
horses
they
reached
the
valley
they
gained
upon
the
burdened
horseman
and
his
tired
horse
they
fired
as
they
rode
the
bullets
spitting
venomously
in
the
dust
around
harry
and
pauline
the
pony
stumbled
harry
jerked
it
up
and
it
struggled
bravely
on
but
the
cries
behind
sounded
louder
the
bullets
hit
nearer
suddenly
the
firing
increased
there
were
more
cries
and
harry
reining
the
pony
saw
galloping
over
the
ridge
to
the
westward
the
full
posse
of
hal
haines
they
fired
as
they
came
they
cut
between
him
and
the
indians
he
stopped
the
pony
and
lifted
pauline
to
the
ground
my
precious
one
god
bless
you
and
forgive
us
all
sobbed
haines
as
polly
was
caught
in
her
mothering
embrace
and
you
you
had
to
come
all
the
way
from
new
york
to
save
her
she
added
turning
to
harry
do
say
anything
about
it
haines
he
said
in
a
stage
whisper
i
came
out
here
to
rest
and
avoid
publicity
chapter
xvi
sophie
mcallan
wedding
a
few
days
after
their
return
from
montana
pauline
sat
reading
by
the
library
window
they
had
come
late
to
the
country
this
summer
and
the
park
of
castle
marvin
had
had
time
to
leave
and
bloom
into
utter
splendor
it
was
like
a
flowery
kingdom
in
the
land
of
faery
and
as
her
eyes
were
lifted
listlessly
now
and
then
from
the
printed
page
they
roamed
over
the
garden
which
lay
like
some
vast
and
radiant
oriental
rug
in
nature
palace
hall
the
distant
forest
was
the
palace
wall
tapestried
in
green
its
dome
a
sky
of
tender
blue
its
lamp
the
morning
sun
its
prince
her
harry
standing
in
the
garden
he
should
always
stand
in
the
garden
thought
pauline
tenderly
the
flowers
are
such
a
splendid
foil
for
him
she
shut
her
eyes
in
sheer
satiety
of
beauty
not
even
the
shabby
man
mopping
his
hot
forehead
as
he
came
along
the
road
marred
the
picture
she
was
a
little
surprised
to
see
him
a
moment
later
talking
in
an
easy
way
with
harry
but
there
was
no
false
pride
in
her
lover
brother
and
all
men
were
his
friends
until
they
proved
themselves
his
enemies
all
except
owen
the
shabby
man
holding
his
hat
between
his
nervous
hands
was
evidently
an
applicant
for
work
harry
pointed
to
the
flower
beds
and
the
rose
trees
with
a
nod
of
inquiry
the
man
assented
vaguely
and
they
came
on
up
the
path
together
making
their
way
towards
the
servants
quarters
over
the
garage
harry
paused
at
the
window
i
have
hired
a
new
gardener
who
does
not
know
his
own
name
he
said
as
they
passed
on
pauline
turned
back
to
the
pages
of
the
cosmopolitan
a
picture
in
an
article
on
the
motor
races
caught
her
eye
and
held
it
for
some
reason
that
she
did
not
at
first
understand
it
was
a
picture
of
a
man
in
costume
with
a
helmet
tight
upon
his
head
and
the
keen
features
and
daring
eyes
peculiar
to
those
who
live
by
peril
she
had
started
to
read
the
caption
when
she
was
interrupted
by
bemis
bringing
her
letters
with
a
little
flutter
of
pleasure
womanlike
she
began
to
read
the
letters
from
their
postmarks
before
opening
them
she
hit
upon
one
that
brought
a
little
peal
of
laughter
from
her
and
she
opened
it
eagerly
and
read
walter
and
i
want
you
and
harry
to
be
with
us
at
the
wedding
faint
we
decided
only
yesterday
and
it
going
to
be
very
quiet
with
just
the
few
people
whom
we
can
reach
with
informal
notes
like
this
you
can
motor
over
in
an
hour
tell
harry
our
lions
arrived
last
thursday
from
germany
and
after
the
wedding
the
keeper
will
exhibit
them
if
harry
wo
come
to
see
me
married
he
come
to
see
the
lions
yours
in
a
flurry
sophie
mcallan
pauline
laughed
again
it
was
like
her
unconventional
chum
sophie
to
arrange
her
wedding
with
the
same
startling
haste
that
had
marked
all
the
breathless
events
of
her
life
the
lions
she
mentioned
were
typical
of
her
original
ideas
she
had
suddenly
announced
to
her
parents
one
day
that
she
was
tired
of
domestic
animals
and
was
going
to
keep
lions
instead
and
her
amused
and
amazed
father
had
not
only
been
forced
to
yield
but
to
keep
his
eye
out
all
over
europe
asia
and
africa
for
new
bargains
in
well
bred
lions
ever
since
it
was
also
typical
of
sophie
that
she
had
selected
from
among
all
the
dashing
wooers
at
her
heels
walter
trumwell
simple
and
sedate
who
was
horrified
by
her
pranks
and
shocked
by
her
use
of
slang
but
who
adored
her
with
the
devotion
of
a
frightened
puppy
their
engagement
had
been
long
announced
it
was
only
in
its
abruptness
that
the
wedding
was
a
surprise
pauline
dropped
the
letter
on
the
table
and
hurried
from
the
room
to
look
for
harry
he
had
head
her
first
call
and
was
coming
in
from
the
garage
pausing
at
the
door
of
the
library
where
he
had
last
seen
her
he
narrowly
avoided
a
collision
with
owen
who
was
hurrying
out
the
look
of
covert
guilt
on
the
secretary
face
aroused
his
latent
suspicion
but
owen
quickly
recovering
himself
bowed
apologized
and
passed
on
harry
stepped
into
the
library
he
saw
the
open
letter
on
the
table
looked
at
the
envelope
and
saw
that
he
was
included
in
the
address
he
read
the
letter
and
the
old
look
of
trouble
came
into
his
eyes
as
he
turned
to
see
if
owen
were
watching
as
he
stepped
into
the
hall
he
saw
the
secretary
leaving
the
house
he
stood
in
the
doorway
and
watched
owen
depart
in
his
own
machine
driven
by
his
own
chauffeur
a
sullen
young
fellow
whom
the
other
employees
held
in
aversion
he
up
to
something
i
wonder
what
harm
he
could
do
at
the
mccallan
wedding
muttered
harry
as
he
moved
down
the
steps
and
out
to
where
the
new
gardener
was
working
the
man
had
been
greatly
improved
as
to
cleanliness
and
clothes
but
there
was
still
the
strange
distant
look
in
his
eyes
as
he
got
up
from
a
flower
bed
to
speak
to
harry
pauline
after
circling
the
house
in
vain
search
of
her
brother
had
returned
to
her
unread
letters
and
her
magazine
as
she
lifted
the
latter
from
the
table
the
picture
of
the
man
in
racing
costume
again
struck
her
eye
and
this
time
she
read
the
caption
ralph
palmer
whose
skull
was
fractured
in
the
vanderbilt
cup
race
and
who
disappeared
from
a
hospital
six
weeks
ago
she
studied
the
face
again
it
seemed
the
living
likeness
of
one
whom
she
had
seen
dead
suddenly
her
thoughts
crystallized
and
she
sprang
up
she
rushed
again
to
the
front
door
carrying
the
magazine
open
and
saw
harry
and
the
gardener
talking
on
the
path
she
ran
down
to
them
the
gardener
took
off
his
hat
but
pauline
looked
at
him
with
such
piercing
scrutiny
that
he
hurried
to
resume
his
work
harry
after
a
brief
affectionate
greeting
turned
to
give
some
last
instructions
and
behind
his
back
pauline
stole
another
look
at
the
magazine
it
is
i
am
sure
it
is
she
said
half
aloud
harry
turned
quickly
what
is
dear
goddess
of
the
garden
he
asked
cheerily
pauline
closed
the
magazine
abruptly
oh
i
i
was
dreaming
she
answered
with
a
little
nervous
laugh
you
ca
have
a
dream
when
you
are
one
he
said
putting
his
arm
about
her
waist
as
they
moved
back
towards
the
house
i
have
news
she
exclaimed
remembering
the
wedding
invitation

mccallan

without
telling
till
the
last
minute

he

farrell

her
threats
and
pretty
pleadings
followed
him
as
he
drove
away
but
harry
did
not
drive
towards
westbury
farther
than
the
first
crossroads
instead
he
swerved
out
across
country
towards
windywild
the
great
mccallan
estate
only
a
vague
purpose
moved
him
his
suspicions
were
groping
but
he
was
forming
dimly
in
his
mind
a
plan
to
keep
pauline
away
from
the
mccallan
wedding
premonition
whispered
that
even
among
the
nuptial
gayeties
there
might
be
danger
on
the
crest
of
winton
hill
from
which
the
road
slopes
down
to
beautiful
windywild
through
parked
forests
but
from
which
the
rambling
white
villa
with
its
barns
and
garage
can
be
seen
in
striking
view
harry
stopped
his
machine
to
his
far
vision
there
was
no
unusual
stir
about
the
mccallan
house
in
spite
of
the
wedding
day
owen
car
was
not
at
the
gate
nor
in
the
yard
and
he
certainly
would
not
have
sent
it
to
the
garage
if
he
were
making
a
business
visit
to
the
manager
of
the
estate
with
a
hateful
sense
of
spying
on
the
innocent
and
the
sincere
dread
of
being
met
there
by
anyone
even
by
owen
he
was
about
to
turn
around
go
back
and
agree
to
take
pauline
to
the
wedding
when
the
movement
of
a
figure
through
the
distant
garage
yard
made
him
stiffen
to
attention
and
strain
his
gaze
in
an
instant
he
had
whipped
his
binoculars
from
under
the
seat
of
the
runabout
and
was
staring
through
them
at
the
establishment
below
a
few
moments
afterwards
he
carefully
replaced
the
glasses
and
drove
away
owen
had
left
the
marvin
place
in
haste
seemingly
intent
upon
a
direct
and
important
errand
but
if
any
one
had
seen
where
the
car
stopped
an
hour
later
both
the
haste
and
the
errand
would
still
have
been
unexplained
they
were
in
the
loneliest
stretch
of
woods
a
half
mile
beyond
the
mccallan
house
when
owen
leaned
forward
and
said
to
his
driver
you
may
stop
here
yes
sir
answered
the
young
man
with
a
respect
that
he
showed
to
no
one
else
he
drew
the
machine
to
the
roadside
and
then
asked
am
i
to
go
with
you
or
stay
here
stay
here
answered
owen
but
do
sit
there
lolling
in
the
seat
we
have
broken
down
you
understand
and
you
will
keep
us
broken
down
and
keep
on
mending
the
machine
until
i
return
owen
who
was
not
averse
to
physical
effort
when
his
dearest
object
was
at
stake
walked
the
half
mile
to
windywild
rapidly
unlike
harry
owen
plans
were
definite
and
fixed
he
strode
through
the
front
gate
but
took
his
way
immediately
to
the
stable
in
front
of
which
two
grooms
were
currying
a
restless
horse
hello
simon
said
owen
my
car
has
broken
down
up
the
road
here
i
wonder
if
you
can
help
me
out
i
guess
so
said
the
groom
not
very
cheerfully
we
got
plenty
to
do
today
as
it
is
owen
with
the
weddin
party
on
an
them
gol
blamed
lions
to
look
after
who
talka
da
lions
cried
a
grim
voice
and
turning
owen
pretended
to
see
for
the
first
time
a
short
heavy
set
man
of
the
gypsy
type
seated
on
a
box
at
the
stable
door
smoking
a
cigarette
and
evidently
regarding
all
the
world
as
the
object
of
his
personal
hate
why
who
is
that
man
asked
owen
of
the
groom
in
a
tone
of
condescending
interest
where
have
i
seen
him
before
if
ye
ever
saw
him
before
ye
would
want
to
see
him
again
declared
the
groom
he
garcia
miss
sophie
new
lion
tamer
but
we
ai
had
time
to
tame
him
yet
he
wild
the
answer
to
this
taunt
was
a
rush
from
garcia
who
uttering
an
unintelligible
roar
that
might
have
done
credit
to
one
of
his
lions
sprang
towards
the
groom
the
latter
took
quick
refuge
behind
the
horse
the
man
fury
made
owen
step
aside
too
but
he
looked
on
with
an
appreciative
smile
as
garcia
came
back
growling
to
his
seat
on
the
box
the
secretary
stepped
up
to
him
and
held
out
his
hand
is
it
really
you
he
said
the
patronage
in
his
voice
offsetting
the
familiarity
of
his
manner
if
it
looks
like
me
it
is
me
snarled
the
gypsy
him
over
there
he
cried
pointing
to
the
groom
he
donta
looka
like
his
own
face
if
i
get
him
come
old
friend
said
owen
in
a
low
voice
do
you
remember
me
do
you
remember
the
zoological
garden
in
brussels
and
the
lion
that
bent
a
cage
so
easily
one
day
that
it
killed
herr
bruner
of
berlin
the
last
words
spoken
almost
in
a
whisper
had
an
electrical
effect
upon
the
lion
tamer
he
fairly
writhed
in
his
seat
and
cowered
away
from
owen
as
from
one
who
held
a
knife
over
his
head
it
was
at
this
moment
that
harry
looking
from
the
hill
put
away
his
binoculars
and
turned
his
car
around
come
let
see
the
lions
may
i
asked
owen
cheerily
ignoring
the
man
terror
secretly
enjoying
it
without
a
word
garcia
led
the
way
into
the
stables
the
lions
six
in
number
were
quartered
in
box
stalls
rebuilt
with
heavy
steel
bars
they
had
been
quiet
but
the
sight
of
a
stranger
set
them
wild
and
their
roaring
thundered
through
the
building
garcia
led
owen
to
farthest
cage
and
stopped
abruptly
you
after
me
he
inquired
his
nerve
partially
recovered
yes
but
to
help
you
not
to
harm
you
old
friend
you
lie
i
theenk
you
tella
the
police
of
the
leetle
accident
in
bresseli
no
no
indeed
you
are
too
useful
a
man
to
lose
garcia
besides
i
need
you
again
the
gypsy
held
up
his
hands
in
refusal
no
he
whispered
i
hava
one
dead
man
face
here
always
he
pointed
to
his
eyes
i
cry
it
away
i
go
all
over
da
world
i
not
forget
he
not
forget
he
folla
me
owen
laughed
come
come
he
said
you
are
foolish
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
affair
except
to
loosen
one
little
bar
ever
so
little
garcia
groaned
and
it
would
be
just
as
easy
to
leave
say
a
cage
door
open
tonight
while
they
having
the
wedding
you
mean
i
mean
only
a
little
joke
nobody
will
be
hurt
i
feel
sure
of
course
if
any
one
should
be
you
could
not
be
blamed
come
i
want
a
quick
answer
if
you
wo
do
it
of
course
you
do
want
anything
said
about
brussels
do
you
old
friend
the
man
uttered
another
cry
owen
drew
money
from
his
pocket
the
man
seized
it
greedily
if
he
was
to
do
the
blackest
of
deeds
there
was
nothing
in
his
conscience
to
prevent
him
from
profiting
tonight
during
the
wedding
remember
said
owen
i
will
give
you
the
signal
and
mind
you
brute
if
you
do
do
it
you
know
what
i
do
to
you
a
few
moments
later
he
was
out
chatting
cheerily
with
the
grooms
not
going
to
ask
you
to
help
me
with
the
car
simon
he
said
too
crowded
today
i
see
i
send
farrell
up
to
the
hodgins
house
and
wait
for
him
he
swung
off
down
the
road
greatly
at
peace
with
all
the
world
he
did
not
even
rebuke
his
chauffeur
when
he
caught
him
loafing
on
the
grass
harry
and
the
household
chauffeur
farrell
were
talking
together
outside
the
garage
and
harry
was
handing
a
bill
to
farrell
who
grinned
broadly
as
he
pocketed
it
owen
saw
nothing
in
this
to
cause
him
apprehension
harry
was
always
generous
with
the
employees
it
was
well
for
owen
plan
that
he
should
go
to
the
wedding
in
so
pleasant
a
mood
pauline
looked
up
from
her
book
as
harry
entered
the
library
i
so
happy
she
cried
you
are
a
darling
boy
to
come
home
so
soon
he
accepted
her
rewarding
kiss
gratefully
yes
i
think
it
all
right
he
said
though
there
are
some
serious
matters
in
hand
at
the
office
the
butler
appeared
at
the
door
farrell
asks
if
he
may
have
a
word
with
you
sir
farrell
why
yes
let
him
come
here
the
chauffeur
cap
in
hand
stepped
into
the
room
guess
i
got
to
take
the
big
car
to
new
york
sir
i
have
got
the
parts
to
fix
it
and
i
ca
get
them
nowhere
but
in
new
york
very
well
that
all
right
farrell
but
be
back
surely
by
four
farrell
warned
pauline
you
are
the
only
driver
i
have
oh
i
get
back
all
right
miss
but
immediately
after
uttering
these
words
in
a
tone
of
perfect
respect
farrell
committed
an
astonishing
offense
against
the
laws
that
separate
servitor
and
employer
he
caught
the
shimmer
of
a
wink
upon
harry
eye
and
he
had
the
audacity
to
return
it
three
minutes
afterwards
farrell
did
a
stranger
thing
going
direct
from
the
house
to
the
telephone
in
the
garage
he
took
up
the
receiver
and
called
up
the
house
owen
passing
by
stopped
spellbound
at
the
door
to
hear
these
mandatory
words
spoken
by
the
chauffeur
to
harry
marvin
whose
answering
voice
could
actually
be
heard
by
owen
through
the
open
window
of
the
library
marvin
you
are
needed
at
your
office
come
at
once
phoned
farrell
he
was
grinning
again
as
he
came
out
of
the
garage
got
into
a
machine
and
drove
away
owen
gazed
after
him
with
puzzled
lowering
brows
chapter
xvii
palmer
comes
back
harry
had
just
hung
up
the
receiver
of
the
telephone
and
had
turned
to
pauline
with
feigned
disappointment
my
office
is
calling
me
he
said
i
needed
there
at
once
i
sha
be
able
to
go
to
the
wedding
the
sight
of
the
happiness
fading
from
her
flowerlike
face
filled
him
with
shame
it
was
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
he
had
lied
to
her
and
he
was
half
sorry
now
that
he
had
done
so
but
he
must
go
through
with
it
now
and
if
there
was
apology
in
the
kisses
he
pressed
on
her
reproachful
eyes
it
was
not
confessed
i
am
going
to
the
wedding
just
the
same
declared
pauline
of
course
you
are
he
agreed
heartily
farrell
will
be
back
with
the
car
by
five
but
who
will
chaperon
me
she
objected
to
her
own
decision
it
would
look
absurd
to
take
margaret
and
owen
invited
you
will
not
need
a
chaperon
going
over
provided
farrell
gets
back
he
said
as
he
took
his
hat
from
the
table
you
mean
you
do
believe
farrell
will
get
back
she
exclaimed
you
are
treating
me
like
a
child
you
do
want
me
to
go
to
the
wedding
just
because
you
ca
go
now
do
do
he
pleaded
as
she
started
to
leave
the
room
i
do
mean
anything
of
the
kind
i
mean
farrell
is
the
only
man
who
can
drive
the
large
car
or
the
roadster
safely
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
he
should
get
back
and
how
am
i
to
come
home
she
demanded
turning
again
toward
him
i
will
call
for
you
in
the
runabout
on
my
way
from
new
york
perhaps
even
i
shall
be
able
to
arrive
in
time
to
greet
the
happy
pair
he
added
cheerfully
you
make
my
excuses
owen
who
was
listening
at
the
door
had
just
time
to
glide
away
before
harry
hurried
out
the
young
master
of
the
house
had
driven
far
toward
the
station
before
the
secretary
returned
to
the
library
this
time
he
entered
and
pretended
to
be
hunting
for
a
magazine
pauline
disconsolate
face
gave
him
the
excuse
he
desired
why
miss
marvin
has
anything
happened
he
asked
in
a
tone
of
concern
oh
everything
has
gone
wrong
she
cried
almost
in
tears
what
do
you
mean
harry
is
called
to
the
city
just
when
we
are
invited
to
sophie
mccallan
wedding
and
farrell
has
taken
the
limousine
for
some
silly
repairs
they
not
get
back
i
know
they
not
they
never
do
but
miss
marvin
oh
do
try
to
apologize
for
him
he
cares
more
for
his
old
business
than
he
does
for
me
he
makes
automobiles
himself
and
yet
i
ca
have
enough
for
my
own
personal
use
i
sorry
i
forgave
him
she
flared
you
are
right
miss
marvin
it
is
an
outrage
she
looked
at
owen
in
astonishment
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
heard
him
venture
a
critical
word
against
harry
i
think
it
is
your
fault
she
declared
you
are
the
one
who
should
see
that
i
have
cars
and
drivers
everything
i
want
but
you
know
the
machines
have
not
come
from
the
town
house
miss
marvin
they
will
be
here
tomorrow
well
owen
it
is
for
you
to
say
that
what
my
brother
does
is
an
outrage
he
does
everything
for
the
best
miss
marvin
harry
is
lying
to
you
he
said
quietly
he
and
your
chauffeur
have
formed
a
plot
against
you
your
car
will
not
be
back
this
afternoon
at
all
she
sprang
to
her
feet
furious
owen
be
still
how
do
you
dare
to
say
such
things
raymond
owen
had
found
his
great
moment
his
enemy
had
set
his
own
trap
and
owen
would
see
that
he
should
not
escape
easily
the
opportunity
to
break
forever
the
bond
of
faith
and
affection
between
harry
and
pauline
had
come
his
voice
rose
as
he
poured
out
his
revelations
and
denunciations
pauline
was
leaving
the
room
when
he
thrust
himself
before
her
you
must
hear
me
i
know
what
i
say
is
true
it
hurts
me
as
deeply
as
it
will
hurt
you
but
you
must
hear
it
i
believe
i
have
discovered
by
the
merest
accident
the
cause
of
all
your
perils
the
plots
against
you
have
been
arranged
at
home
you
are
mad
i
will
not
listen
to
you
let
me
pass
not
until
you
have
heard
he
declared
firmly
i
was
passing
the
door
of
the
garage
only
a
few
moments
ago
he
went
on
in
a
rapid
whisper
i
saw
farrell
at
the
telephone
he
called
the
private
house
number
the
number
of
this
phone
on
the
table
you
and
marvin
were
sitting
here
i
was
so
surprised
that
i
stopped
and
listened
to
farrell
words
i
could
see
marvin
listening
at
the
phone
here
farrell
said
marvin
you
are
needed
at
your
office
come
at
once
then
he
hung
up
the
receiver
and
came
out
laughing
he
got
into
the
limousine
and
drove
off
towards
the
city
if
he
could
drive
the
limousine
to
the
city
could
he
not
drive
it
to
the
mccallan
for
you
pauline
put
her
hands
to
her
ears
with
a
protesting
cry
it
is
true
she
whispered
it
is
only
a
scheme
of
farrell
to
get
an
afternoon
off
it
is
a
scheme
of
harry
to
keep
you
from
the
wedding
for
what
purpose
only
he
knows
it
is
one
of
many
schemes
that
have
held
your
life
in
constant
peril
i
saw
their
plan
arranged
i
saw
your
brother
hand
money
to
farrell
at
the
door
of
the
garage
and
they
parted
laughing
pauline
mind
whirled
i
wo
believe
it
i
ca
i
ca
she
cried
doubt
and
fear
and
fury
mingled
in
her
breast
weeping
tumultuously
she
rushed
past
owen
and
up
to
her
own
room
two
hours
later
the
struggle
over
she
called
margaret
who
bathed
her
hot
temples
and
dressed
her
for
the
wedding
harry
marvin
in
town
tried
his
best
to
make
good
use
of
the
time
he
had
stolen
but
the
thought
of
his
chicanery
was
heavy
on
his
mind
and
it
was
not
unmixed
with
apprehension
after
all
pauline
might
find
a
way
to
go
to
the
wedding
might
he
not
instead
of
having
averted
a
danger
simply
have
absented
himself
from
the
scene
of
danger
when
he
was
most
needed
his
nervousness
increased
he
found
himself
incapable
of
work
and
at
three
to
the
surprise
of
his
clerks
who
had
thought
his
unexpected
visit
must
mean
an
important
conference
of
directors
he
called
a
taxicab
and
started
for
westbury
but
he
had
no
intention
of
going
to
castle
marvin
unless
it
was
necessary
he
meant
to
telephone
from
westbury
and
learn
whether
or
not
pauline
had
gone
to
the
wedding
if
she
had
not
he
would
remain
away
until
late
a
few
minutes
before
four
farrell
with
his
pretty
wife
whom
he
had
called
to
share
his
plot
and
his
holiday
drove
up
to
a
rural
telegraph
office
they
were
both
laughing
as
farrell
handed
this
message
to
the
operator
miss
pauline
marvin
castle
marvin
westbury
ca
get
back
this
evening
george
farre
you
do
want
to
say
what
kind
of
a
it
is
do
you
grinned
the
operator
glancing
out
of
the
window
at
the
spic
and
span
machine
if
you
do
see
everything
you
look
at
you
save
your
eyesight
replied
farrell
cheerfully
at
the
next
town
he
telephoned
to
the
marvin
office
in
new
york
he
came
out
of
the
booth
with
a
worried
look
the
boss
has
left
in
a
taxi
for
home
he
said
wonder
what
that
means
guess
we
better
sort
of
travel
along
towards
westbury
he
might
need
me
they
changed
their
course
and
had
driven
for
some
time
at
an
easy
rate
through
the
smiling
country
when
the
sound
of
a
machine
coming
up
speedily
behind
caused
farrell
to
look
around
the
passenger
in
the
open
cab
waved
his
hand
and
farrell
saluting
slowed
down
the
cars
stopped
side
by
side
harry
raised
his
hat
to
the
young
woman
you
not
going
home
are
you
farrell
he
said

fine
farrell
grinned
the
taxi
started
on
and
farrell
turned
off
at
the
next
crossroad
he
a
great
boss
but
a
queer
one
he
said
to
his
wife
it
a
queer
family
all
around
i
wonder
what
being
cooked
up
now
as
the
time
of
farrell
expected
return
drew
near
pauline
despair
and
anger
increased
with
every
moment
when
four
struck
she
arose
and
walked
nervously
out
to
the
garage
to
ask
if
any
word
had
been
received
from
farrell
she
found
owen
there
as
she
turned
toward
him
after
her
futile
questioning
pauline
grief
suddenly
mounted
to
anger
it
is
after
four
and
farrell
has
not
returned
she
exclaimed
she
had
come
out
to
the
yard
in
the
exquisite
white
gown
that
she
was
to
wear
to
the
wedding
a
flashing
jewel
at
her
white
throat
her
hair
done
regally
high
now
in
her
anger
she
was
a
picture
of
fury
made
beautiful
her
outburst
was
interrupted
by
a
messenger
boy
with
a
telegram
she
opened
the
message
with
nervous
fingers
blow
out
ca
get
back
this
evening
she
read
she
tore
the
message
into
pieces
dropped
them
and
stamped
upon
them
with
her
white
slippers
it
true
it
true
she
cried
turning
desperately
to
owen
i
am
terribly
hopelessly
sorry
but
i
knew
that
it
was
true
he
said
solemnly
at
this
moment
along
the
drive
came
the
new
gardener
wheeling
a
barrow
of
fresh
mold
his
rake
and
hoe
lying
across
it
palmer
pauline
cried
the
man
let
fall
the
barrow
as
if
he
had
been
cut
with
a
whip
lash
he
looked
up
and
for
an
instant
his
dazed
eyes
seemed
to
brighten
then
he
picked
up
the
barrow
as
if
no
one
had
spoken
and
went
on
pauline
followed
him
bring
out
the
roadster
she
called
over
her
shoulder
and
as
she
stopped
beside
the
gardener
the
garage
men
bewildered
but
used
to
the
kindly
vagaries
of
their
pretty
employer
sent
the
machine
down
driveway
can
you
drive
an
automobile
palmer
asked
pauline
this
time
the
man
eyes
did
not
brighten
he
looked
at
her
respectfully
but
dully
she
drew
him
to
the
car
and
repeated
the
question
he
only
grinned
foolishly
and
kept
on
shaking
his
head
wait
she
said
and
running
back
to
the
house
reappeared
directly
wearing
her
hat
and
flowing
white
wrap
come
palmer
you
must
drive
me
to
the
wedding
she
declared
she
made
him
get
into
the
car
and
take
the
wheel
as
she
got
in
beside
him
his
hands
fumbled
aimlessly
with
the
lever
palmer
palmer
she
dinned
his
forgotten
name
into
his
ears
you
remember
the
race
the
road
the
flying
cars
the
speed
the
speed
do
you
remember
the
man
who
was
in
the
lead
the
man
the
crowd
cheered
for
that
was
you
palmer
the
greatest
of
all
the
drivers
she
leaned
forward
in
the
seat
arms
outstretched
as
if
holding
a
tugging
wheel
eyes
set
straight
ahead
slippered
feet
threading
imaginary
levers
graceful
body
swerving
he
watched
her
frowning
a
vague
purpose
seemed
to
animate
the
hand
groping
with
the
levers
wake
up
palmer
it
time
for
the
race
the
vanderbilt
cup
kirby
and
michaels
have
started
there
wharton
coming
to
the
line
you
see
the
crowds
ca
you
hear
them
cheering
palmer
palmer
yes
we
coming
palmer
is
coming
back
way
there
he
found
the
the
engine
sounded
he
found
the
clutch
and
gears
his
eyes
were
shut
the
car
started
slowly
and
he
opened
his
eyes
pauline
sank
back
in
the
seat
laughing
and
clapping
her
hands
half
hysterically
bravo
palmer
she
exulted
the
astonished
workmen
saw
them
glide
through
the
outer
gate
raymond
owen
from
his
window
saw
them
and
rubbed
his
hands
pleasantly
fate
indeed
seemed
to
be
favoring
his
deadly
work
today
the
car
swung
into
the
highway
drive
faster
commanded
pauline
the
listless
hands
hardened
on
the
wheel
she
saw
him
bend
over
and
fix
his
vision
on
the
road
she
thrilled
at
the
miracle
she
had
wrought
more
speed
and
the
wind
blew
her
cape
from
her
shoulders
the
dust
beat
in
her
face
she
merely
tightened
her
veil
and
sat
silent
take
the
first
turn
to
the
right
she
called
in
his
ear
as
they
neared
the
crossroad
he
did
not
slacken
the
speed
it
a
sharp
turn
slow
a
little
she
cautioned
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
her
she
placed
her
hand
sharply
on
his
arm
he
drove
past
the
crossroad
the
speed
to
the
last
notch
pauline
tried
to
stand
up
in
the
seat
and
seize
the
wheel
he
thrust
her
back
with
one
hand
not
even
looking
at
her
he
was
leaning
far
over
the
wheel
now
his
eyes
blazing
she
could
see
the
beat
of
blood
in
his
temple
stop
stop
you
are
on
the
wrong
road
you
will
kill
us
both
she
screamed
in
his
deaf
ears
she
tried
again
to
wrest
the
wheel
from
him
but
this
time
he
held
her
fast
after
he
had
flung
her
back
she
had
raised
up
a
frankenstein
for
her
own
destruction
she
was
being
driven
by
a
madman
as
they
took
the
curve
outside
westbury
village
another
car
filled
with
men
and
women
fairly
grazed
them
the
women
screamed
and
the
men
shouted
wildly
after
them
but
they
flashed
on
down
the
hill
at
gangley
mills
the
pace
grew
even
greater
from
the
west
prong
of
the
road
fork
at
the
bottom
a
taxicab
shot
into
view
there
was
a
shout
of
warning
a
rattle
and
creak
as
the
taxi
swerved
safe
by
inches
on
the
skirts
of
clayville
a
group
of
farmers
and
a
constable
were
arguing
a
roadside
dispute
pauline
could
see
dim
figures
leap
into
the
road
waving
arms
she
could
hear
them
shouting
the
figures
jumped
to
either
side
as
palmer
drove
through
the
group
they
sprang
back
into
the
road
cursing
and
shaking
their
fists
only
to
be
routed
anew
by
the
rush
of
the
taxicab
following
the
roadster
straightened
out
on
the
ledge
of
scrogg
hill
in
spite
of
the
curve
and
the
precipice
palmer
held
his
speed
his
daring
his
utter
mastery
stirred
a
kind
of
admiration
in
pauline
and
the
death
she
saw
looming
stirred
anew
her
courage
she
wrenched
her
arm
free
from
his
grip
she
stood
up
and
swung
her
weight
against
the
man
rasping
for
the
wheel
the
car
swerved
toward
the
cliff
but
he
jerked
it
back
striking
at
her
brutally
with
his
free
hand
she
fell
in
the
seat
but
returned
desperate
to
the
encounter
she
caught
the
wheel
she
tried
to
command
it
but
his
strength
drew
the
other
way
the
machine
shot
toward
the
abyss
there
was
a
crackle
as
the
wooden
guide
fence
splintered
under
the
wheels
there
was
a
crash
harry
leaning
from
the
taxicab
behind
uttered
a
groan
the
roadster
had
gone
over
the
cliff
fifty
feet
down
the
hillside
they
took
pauline
from
the
clutch
of
the
dead
driver
his
fall
had
broken
hers
and
it
was
only
from
fear
that
she
had
fainted
harry
pressing
the
taxi
flask
to
her
lips
saw
her
eyes
open
and
his
cry
was
like
a
prayer
of
thanksgiving
when
harry
lifted
pauline
to
carry
her
to
the
taxicab
to
his
abasement
he
felt
her
hands
press
him
away
he
thought
she
had
not
yet
recovered
that
she
believed
herself
still
in
the
grasp
of
the
madman
he
set
her
on
her
feet
and
looked
at
her
questioningly
without
a
word
she
turned
from
him
and
started
up
the
road
pauline
he
cried
what
do
you
mean
do
you
know
me
harry
she
kept
on
without
turning
he
caught
her
by
the
arm
do
you
know
me
your
brother
he
pleaded
she
turned
tremblingly
you
are
not
my
brother
she
blazed
and
i
did
not
know
you
until
today
you
are
hurt
and
ill
dearest
come
let
me
take
you
home
she
walked
on
up
the
road
but
where
are
you
going
he
demanded
i
am
going
to
the
wedding
you
tried
to
keep
me
away
by
your
base
trick
but
you
ca
do
it
now
he
understood
i
know
i
know
he
groaned
it
was
the
meanest
and
most
useless
thing
but
i
did
not
think
it
was
safe
for
you
to
go
to
the
wedding
i
am
sorry
to
the
bottom
of
my
heart
goodbye
she
said
coldly
walking
on
but
you
ca
go
like
that
he
exclaimed
pointing
to
her
torn
and
draggled
clothes
her
unfastened
hair
it
is
better
to
go
to
friends
whom
i
can
trust
she
said
coldly
and
moved
on
as
gently
as
he
could
he
lifted
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
to
the
taxicab
placing
her
in
the
seat
he
followed
and
as
the
machine
started
began
to
pour
out
his
repentance
she
would
not
even
answer
but
sat
with
averted
face
weeping
and
trembling
at
last
she
became
quiet
he
drew
her
tattered
wrap
closer
about
her
shoulders
and
put
his
arm
around
her
so
that
her
head
rested
against
his
breast
a
moment
later
looking
down
he
was
surprised
to
see
that
she
was
smiling
like
a
tired
child

she
answered
taking
the
morning
paper
from
the
table
unfolding
it
she
showed
him
a
headline

lordnor
stables
to
be
auctioned

in
the
least
i
am
going
to
buy
firefly
and
ride
him
in
the
steeplechase
handicap
harry
smile
was
almost
despairing
but
he
answered
quickly
oh
i
see
you
have
me
ride
him
and
break
my
precious
neck
i
thought
for
a
second
you
meant
to

what
i
do
mean
it
will
be
gorgeously
exciting
and
perfectly
safe
safe
well
of
course
i
might
be
killed
by
a
fall
or
something
he
laughed
in
spite
of
himself
i
shall
not
permit
it
he
said
you
will
not
permit
it
she
beamed
then
i
ask
my
guardian
i
may
ride
firefly
in
the
steeplechase
if
i
choose
may
i
owen
she
asked
brightly
pauline
could
never
bear
malice
already
she
had
forgiven
owen
as
well
as
harry
the
secretary
had
just
entered
and
was
watching
the
two
with
a
questioning
eye
if
we
own
firefly
you
may
he
smiled
back
at
her
i
told
you
she
triumphed
over
harry
but
we
do
own
him
said
owen
puzzled
we
shall
this
afternoon

of

ca

outbid
does
miss
pauline
really
mean
this
asked
the
secretary
she
does
harry
answered
in
a
tone
of
disgust
at
what
he
thought
now
was
only
owen
weakness
there
seemed
no
chance
of
a
plot
against
pauline
in
this
original
scheme
of
her
own
she
rides
wonderfully
i
do
not
see
why
she
should
not
owen
condescended
you
do
seem
to
see
much
of
anything
declared
harry
but
you
take
me
to
the
auction
coaxed
pauline
i
have
to
or
you
spend
the
whole

from
the
room
laughing
bareheaded
he
walked
quite
across
the
garden
and
down
into
the
by
the
path
gate
a
gypsy
was
leaning
upon
the
gate
and
gazing
nervously
up
and
down
the
road
he
turned
at
the
sound
of
owen
footsteps
and
the
eyes
of
the
young
chief
michel
mario
gazed
apprehensively
into
the
smiling
eyes
of
the
secretary
how
are
you
balthazar
greeted
owen
do
use
that
name
to
me
pleaded
the
gypsy
you

all
the
way
back
from
port
vincent
to
see

faintest
tinge
of
sarcasm

a
horse
balthazar
many
times
but

with
my

grinned
the
chief
i
mean
with
a
hypodermic
needle
i
mean
a
race
that
he
might
possibly
fall
in
a
race
and
injure
the
rider

very
easy
but
very
dangerous
i
should

exclaimed
owen
petulantly
here
is
the
money
balthazar
gloated
over
the
yellow
bills
and
here
is
the
weapon
the
gypsy
took
the
needle
from
the
hand
of
the
secretary
and
thrust
it
quickly
into
the
inside
pocket
of
his
blouse
thank
you
master
i
will
do
what
you
say
said
the
gypsy
making
a
move
to

not
quite
so
fast
commanded
owen
you
do
not
know
the
place
or
the
time

the
gypsy
promptly

michael

wealthiest
of
sportsmen
attended
the
auction
of
the
lordnor
stables
and
seemed
bent
on
adding
the
entire
string
of
splendid
horses
to
his
own
monarchs
of
the
track
the
only
time
during
the
afternoon
that
he
met
with
defeat
was
when
the

steeplechaser
firefly
was
brought
out
five

caliban
curtly
six
hundred
said
the

voice
of
a
girl
and
the
crowd
turned
to
look
caliban
smiled
condescendingly
a
thousand
he
said
there
you
see
you

any
more
cautioned
harry
fifteen
hundred

cried
pauline

is
this
only
a
joke
demanded
caliban
turning
to
the

good
enough
for
me

at
fifteen
hundred

turned
away
and
strode
disgustedly
out
of
the
crowd
amid
hoots
of
laughter
he
is
worth
it
why
he
is
worth
any
price
cried
pauline
as
the
smiling
groom
led
firefly
up
to
her
the
magnificent
animal
thrust
its
nose
instantly
between
her
outstretched
arms
and
as
she
patted
him
delightedly
the
crowd
rippled
with
spontaneous
applause
harry
joined
her
on
the
way
to
see
firefly
put
in
his
stall
he
gave
the
caretaker
instructions
and
laughingly
dragged
pauline
away
from
her
new
pet
as
they
entered
their
machine
raymond
owen
came
from
behind
the
stable
engrossed
in
the
business
complications
growing
out
of
the
european
conflict
harry
had
quite
forgotten
firefly
and
the
steeplechase
when
the
day
of
the
great
jericho
handicap
arrived
he
was
in
the
library
reading
a
letter
when
there
burst
upon
his
sight
through
the
open
doorway
a
vision
that
took
his
breath
away
pauline
in
full
jockey
uniform
white
and
blue
and
yellow
was
pirouetting
on
her
gleaming
black
boots
before
him
polly
he
cried
unable
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
the
prank
have
you
cut
off
your
hair
he
added
in
alarm
no
here
it
is
she
laughed
snapping
off
her
visored
cap
and
revealing
masses
of
hair
oh
do
do
it
he
begged
look
here
a
letter
from
the
mccallans
asking
us
to
their
house
party
in
the
adirondacks
expected
tomorrow
let
go
there
instead
he
handed
her
the
letter
without
glancing
at
it
she
flicked
it
into
the
air
with
her
riding
crop
and
danced
out
of
her
so
i
surrender
again
he
murmured
laughing
in
spite
of
himself
riding
out
toward
the
starting
line
pauline
swerved
her
course
a
little
to
avoid
the
gaze
of
the
gentlemen
riders
who
eyed
her
curiously
she
heard
a
call
from
an
automobile
beside
the
track
and
rode
over
to
where
harry
and
owen
were
seated
in
the
car
their
lifted
hats
as
she
bent
to
shake
hands
with
them
caused
the
crowd
to
stare
in
astonishment
pauline
blushing
furiously
sped
firefly
to
the
line
that
horse
works
queer
commented
harry
as
she
rode
away
do
you
think
so
asked
owen
yes
it
on
edge
but
its
legs
are
shaky
i
wonder
but
the
riders
were
ready
the
signal
sounded
the
crowd
cheer
rose
in
the
names
of
their
various
favorites
were
unbuckled
by
jolly
firefly
took
the
first
jump
in
the
lead
cried
harry
a
thrill
of
admiration
lightening
the
worry
in
his
heart
he
all
right
said
owen
over
the
wide
green
the
horses
began
to
string
out
with
firefly
ahead
she
going
to
win
it
i
believe
she
is
exclaimed
harry
excitedly
as
he
and
owen
stood
in
the
automobile
no
no
he
wobbled
at
the
fourth
jump
he
losing
ground
but
firefly
seemed
suddenly
to
grip
his
strength
as
one
horse
passed
him
he
pulled
himself
together
under
pauline
urging
he
regained
the
lead
they
came
down
splendidly
toward
the
homestretch
the
bodies
of
the
powerful
beasts
rose
one
by
one
over
the
last
hedge
they
over
they
won
or
heaven
help
her
they
down
leading
at
the
last
jump
the
drugged
heart
of
the
great
horse
had
conquered
his
courage
as
he
stumbled
heavily
pauline
shot
over
his
head
and
lay
helpless
in
the
path
of
the
other
riders
harry
dashing
madly
toward
the
track
but
hopelessly
far
from
her
had
to
turn
away
his
head
as
the
crashing
hoofs
passed
her
when
he
looked
again
attendants
were
carrying
her
swiftly
to
the
clubhouse
he
sped
toward
it
owen
following
harry
tore
his
way
through
the
excited
crowd
to
the
side
of
pauline
a
doctor
was
administering
restoratives
pauline
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
about
her
bewildered
she
saw
harry
anxious
face
and
smiled
penitently
i
learned
a
lesson
this
time
she
whispered
it
is
nothing
serious
her
shoulder
bruised
a
little
said
the
doctor
thank
heaven
breathed
raymond
owen
with
well
feigned
emotion
chapter
xix
owen
offers
a
reward
cries
of
delight
coming
in
the
voice
of
pauline
from
the
direction
of
the
garage
made
harry
lay
down
his
newspaper
and
go
forth
to
investigate
as
he
approached
he
saw
bemis
and
lucille
coachman
lifting
a
crate
from
a
carriage
from
within
the
crate
came
the
whimpering
barks
of
an
imprisoned
bull
terrier
oh
is
he
dear
cried
pauline
turning
to
harry
i
do
know
i
have
yet
made
his
acquaintance
where
did
he
come
from
lucille
sent
him
to
me
johnson
just
brought
him
over
hurry
bemis
and
let
him
out
the
poor
darling
is
that
what
is
called
puppy
love
inquired
harry
hush
commanded
pauline
and
bemis
run
and
tell
martha
to
cook
something
for
him
a
beefsteak
and
potatoes
and
oysters
on
the
half
shell
suggested
harry
love
me
announced
pauline
sternly
love
my
dog
the
coachman
had
ripped
of
the
last
top
bar
of
the
crate
and
a
splendid
terrier
sprang
out
with
a
suddenness
that
made
pauline
retreat
a
little
but
as
if
he
had
been
trained
to
his
part
he
bent
his
head
and
with
wagging
tail
approached
her
in
an
instant
she
was
kneeling
beside
him
rewarding
his
homage
with
enthusiastic
pats
and
fantastic
encomiums
why
he
likes
me
already
is
he
charming
she
demanded
harry
threw
up
his
hands
and
this
for
a
dog
a
new
dog
possibly
a
mad
dog
you
are
a
brute
the
dog
was
making
rapid
acquaintance
with
his
new
home
investigating
the
garage
and
more
profoundly
the
kitchen
door
here
cyrus
come
cyrus
called
pauline
and
started
towards
the
house
owen
in
his
motorcycle
togs
was
lighting
a
cigar
on
the
veranda
when
they
came
up
the
steps
without
even
pretending
to
enter
into
pauline
enthusiasm
over
the
terrier
he
excused
himself
and
walked
off
briskly
in
the
direction
of
the
garage
a
few
minutes
later
they
saw
him
on
the
motorcycle
speeding
down
the
drive
i
wonder
what
the
impressive
business
is
today
remarked
harry
sarcastically
let
poor
owen
alone
he
is
good
and
kind
even
if
he
does
care
for
cyrus
look
here
why
do
you
ever
say
any
of
these
nice
things
to
me
the
things
you
say
to
dogs
and
secretaries
because
i
promised
to
marry
you
some
day
and
it
is
fatal
to
let
a
husband
even
a
futurity
husband
know
that
you
admire
him
well
as
long
as
you
do
it
is
all
right
a
half
mile
down
the
main
road
to
westbury
a
runabout
was
drawn
up
and
a
converted
gypsy
was
alternately
pretending
to
repair
an
imaginary
break
and
relieving
his
by
pacing
the
road
fantastic
garments
had
given
way
to
a
plain
sack
suit
and
motor
duster
but
the
profit
of
his
employment
by
raymond
owen
was
worth
the
discomfort
of
becoming
civilized
the
muttering
of
a
distant
motor
made
him
fall
to
his
knees
and
wrench
in
hand
wiggle
hastily
under
the
machine
to
all
appearance
he
was
bitterly
with
the
woes
of
a
stalled
tourist
when
a
motorcycle
chugged
to
a
stop
beside
the
runabout
and
owen
called
him
i
thought
you
had
failed
of
our
appointment
master
he
said
eagerly
as
he
crawled
out
i
have
waited
for
more
than
half
an
hour
it
is
sad
that
you
should
be
inconvenienced
old
friend
answered
owen
i
have
done
what
you
commanded
me
master
balthazar
said
with
an
ingratiating
smile
i
have
found
them
found
whom
the
friends
i
spoke
about
at
our
last
meeting
the
little
band
that
earns
money
by
making
it
oh
yes
your
counterfeiters
are
they
to
be
trusted
master
all
guilty
men
are
to
be
trusted
there
is
always
protection
in
knowing
the
sins
of
others
sometimes
balthazar
i
almost
suspect
you
of
possessing
a
brain
but
remember
i
have
told
you
that
i
shall
soon
be
through
unless
you
accomplish
something
master
it
is
because
i
dare
not
risk
your
freedom
your
life
for
myself
i
care
nothing
i
live
to
serve
you
who
have
been
my
benefactor
you
lie
of
course
remarked
owen
casually
but
what
of
the
new
plan
they
are
in
bantersville
only
twelve
miles
from
castle
marvin
a
house
that
has
been
long
occupied
and
with
no
houses
near
and
they
are
still
manufacturing
coins
there
yes
but
they
are
becoming
frightened
two
of
the
distributors
have
been
arrested
they
would
be
glad
of
a
safer
a
swifter
method
of
making
money
come
along
then
owen
mounted
the
motorcycle
while
balthazar
sprang
to
the
seat
and
started
the
runabout
they
sped
briskly
over
the
roads
turning
at
last
into
an
old
wagon
path
fringed
by
the
branches
of
trees
the
machine
swished
through
the
barrier
leaves
and
came
out
upon
a
small
clearing
where
there
stood
a
gaunt
house
evidently
long
deserted
balthazar
drove
on
along
the
road
for
almost
a
quarter
of
a
mile
before
he
stopped
the
machine
owen
following
without
question
they
left
the
runabout
and
the
motorcycle
and
walked
back
to
the
house
it
is
an
excellent
location
commented
owen
as
balthazar
lead
the
way
into
a
basement
entrance
who
did
you
say
was
the
man
in
charge
of
the
concern
rupert
wallace
he
is
a
like
yourself
though
no
match
for
you
in
mind
master
balthazar
as
he
spoke
was
rapping
lightly
on
a
wall
which
had
no
sign
of
a
door
it
was
pitch
dark
where
they
stood
but
suddenly
with
hardly
a
sound
two
sliding
doors
opened
to
the
gypsy
signal
and
a
faint
light
from
a
gas
jet
on
the
wall
gleamed
on
an
inner
passage
balthazar
closely
followed
by
owen
walked
quickly
down
the
secret
hall
and
without
signal
this
time
another
set
of
silent
doors
opened
upon
a
brightly
lighted
room
a
crabbed
withered
woman
admitted
them
the
room
was
overheated
because
of
the
presence
of
a
gas
forge
on
which
a
cauldron
of
metal
was
being
melted
on
one
side
there
was
a
stamping
press
and
on
the
other
a
set
of
molds
wallace
noted
owen
curiosity
and
stepping
to
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
picked
up
a
handful
of
pieces
you
are
interested
in
our
work
the
work
of
supplying
the
poor
with
sufficient
funds
to
meet
the
increased
cost
of
living
he
said
smiling
these
are
some
of
our
product
we
are
proud
of
them
the
weight
is
exactly
that
of
the
true
piece
and
only
one
man
in
fifty
could
tell
the
difference
in
the
ring
of
the
metal
owen
looked
at
the
coins
in
sincere
admiration
it
is
very
remarkable
he
said
but
balthazar
tells
me
i
know
you
have
a
little
business
of
secrecy
for
myself
and
my
friends
you
may
speak
here
in
perfect
safety
owen
gossip
is
not
a
fault
or
a
possibility
of
our
profession
i
do
not
believe
there
is
anything
to
say
but
what
balthazar
has
already
told
you
except
owen
hesitated
except
what
master
is
there
a
change
in
the
plan
asked
balthazar
i
think
there
might
be
something
occurred
today
that
might
give
us
a
favorable
lead
miss
pauline
received
as
a
gift
a
terrier
dog
i
believe
it
could
be
made
use
of
in
what
way
asked
the
counterfeiter
by
stealing
it
and
bringing
it
here
i
do
understand
ah
yes
indeed
i
do
excellent
master
exclaimed
balthazar
it
could
be
done
today
can
i
have
two
of
your
men
rupert
yes
take
gaston
and
firenzi
they
are
always
to
be
trusted
at
his
words
two
men
stepped
forward
one
of
them
had
been
working
at
the
metal
pots
but
in
response
to
a
hurried
word
from
rupert
he
quickly
threw
off
his
cap
and
apron
and
caught
up
a
hat
and
coat
rupert
wallace
stepped
to
the
side
of
the
room
where
a
pair
of
upright
levers
stood
out
of
the
floor
like
the
levers
of
an
automobile
he
pulled
the
one
nearest
him
and
the
sliding
doors
parted
softly
owen
and
balthazar
with
their
new
escort
stepped
through
for
a
moment
wallace
waited
then
he
drew
back
the
other
lever
and
the
departing
guests
found
as
they
reached
the
end
of
the
secret
passage
that
their
path
opened
almost
magically
before
them
in
the
hushed
unfolding
of
the
second
door
goodbye
cyrus
said
harry
as
pauline
strolling
down
the
garden
with
him
tossed
to
her
new
pet
a
dainty
from
the
box
of
she
carried
what
do
you
mean
by
that
she
demanded
that
the
oysters
on
the
half
shell
would
be
better
for
his
health
i
did
give
him
oysters
on
the
half
shell
no
but
you
gave
him
everything
else
in
the
house
he
is
stuffed
like
the
fatted
calf
or
like
the
prodigal
son
i
do
care
which
if
he
likes
candy
he
shall
have
candy
declared
pauline
sitting
down
on
an
arbor
bench
and
extending
another
to
the
dog
the
gratitude
of
cyrus
was
expressed
in
a
leap
to
the
side
of
his
mistress
as
harry
sat
down
he
discovered
that
cyrus
had
occupied
the
favored
place
beside
pauline
next
instant
there
was
a
yowl
of
dismay
and
the
adored
gift
of
lucille
fell
several
feet
away
from
the
bench
harry
i
think
that
is
dreadful
exclaimed
pauline
springing
to
her
feet
i
do
too
he
answered
that
was
why
i
threw
it
off
the
bench
to
treat
a
poor
innocent
dumb
creature
like
that
polly
you
do
mean
it
do
you
you
think
i
hurt
him
that
does
matter
but
if
i
hurt
yours
it
does
i
apologize
you
are
always
joking
you
do
understand
how
sweet
and
dear
animals
are
you
will
probably
treat
me
the
same
way
after
we
are
married
she
ran
to
the
spot
where
the
wary
cyrus
was
munching
the
last
piece
of
candy
but
he
accepted
her
caresses
without
enthusiasm
keeping
a
careful
eye
on
harry
she
called
to
the
dog
and
walked
briskly
toward
the
house
but
cyrus
did
not
follow
the
box
of
candy
was
still
on
the
garden
bench
and
cyrus
was
not
immune
to
temptation
owen
followed
on
his
motorcycle
the
runabout
in
which
balthazar
and
the
two
chosen
members
of
rupert
wallace
band
made
their
swift
journey
toward
castle
marvin
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
grounds
owen
drew
alongside
this
would
be
a
good
place
to
stop
the
car
can
be
hidden
in
the
lane
yes
master
said
balthazar
he
wheeled
the
machine
upon
a
narrow
roadway
into
the
cover
of
the
woods
and
with
his
companions
got
out
owen
rode
on
ahead
and
was
waiting
for
them
as
they
neared
the
little
foot
path
gate
to
the
marvin
grounds
look
through
the
hedge
there
he
directed
balthazar
crawled
on
his
hands
and
knees
to
the
box
wall
that
surrounded
the
grounds
he
thrust
his
shoulders
through
the
bush
and
gazed
for
a
moment
at
the
dog
devouring
pauline
on
the
bench
i
should
say
it
would
be
well
to
act
now
instantly
master
he
cried
returning
go
on
i
will
be
at
the
house
and
will
try
to
hold
them
back
if
there
is
any
noise
as
owen
began
to
wheel
his
cycle
up
the
drive
to
castle
marvin
balthazar
and
his
two
aides
wriggled
through
the
crossed
a
strip
of
sward
and
reached
the
bench
balthazar
caught
the
dog
head
in
his
powerful
hands
there
was
not
a
sound
the
animal
muzzle
was
shut
fast
and
in
a
minute
it
had
been
tied
leg
and
body
they
ran
to
the
gate
to
the
runabout
and
were
away
why
harry
i
ca
find
him
anywhere
what
could
have
happened
to
him
cried
pauline
rushing
into
the
library
owen
lost
thank
heaven
he
exclaimed
fervently
no
cyrus
harry
it
your
fault
he
was
angry
because
you
pushed
him
off
the
bench
and
he
ran
away
polly
he
said
wheeling
in
his
chair
i
am
not
worried
i
decline
to
be
worried
and
i
am
going
away
from
here
not
before
you
help
me
find
cyrus
yes
long
before
she
turned
and
whisked
crossly
out
of
the
room
harry
picked
up
his
hat
and
coat
and
in
a
few
minutes
was
being
driven
away
by
farrell
on
an
urgent
call
to
town
pauline
stood
on
the
veranda
and
watched
his
departure
with
silent
wrath
i
wonder
if
he
is
really
cruel
or
if
he
is
just
a
man
and
does
know
any
better
she
pondered
audibly
then
as
she
saw

chapter

cyrus
makes
a
reputation
the
proceedings
behind
the
hidden
doors
in
the
cellar
of
the
ruined
house
between
bathwater
and
castle
marvin
were
not
interrupted
by
so
small
a
matter
as
the
kidnapping
of
an
heiress
a
kidnapping
that
had
progressed
no
further
as
yet
than
the
capture
of
a
dog
as
owen
stepped
into
the
den
the
next
forenoon
he
saw
the
bull
terrier
tied
to
the
wall
i
see
we
have
the
main
ingredient
of
the
repast
in
hand
the
main

most
dangerous
said
wallace
he
has
done
nothing
but
howl
and
bark
may
we
kill
him
not
yet
answered
owen
it
is
possible
that
she
might
demand
sight
of
him
before
entering
the
house
or
some
nonsense
of
that
sort
i
would
let
him
howl

little
longer
very
well
laughed
wallace

the
other

kept
steadily
on
at
their
work
over
the
melting

the
old
woman
was
stacking

at
the

the

table
wallace
produced
from
a
drawer
a
pen
paper
and
ink
and
told
the
woman
to
take
his
chair

dictated

mary
sheila
myrtle
avenue
the
old
woman
wrote
slowly
in
a
shaking
hand
and
owen
waited
patiently
while
she
addressed
an
envelope
then
he
placed
the
letter
in
the
envelope
sealed
it
and
took
his
leave
and
no
sign
of
cyrus
inquired
harry
cheerily
as
he
entered
the
library
where
pauline
sat
disconsolate
she
did
not
even
answer
and
she
was
still
gazing
dejectedly
out
of
the
window
when
bemis
brought
in
the
mail
two
of
the
letters
she
laid
aside
unread
the
third
she
opened
a
dog
came
to
my
house
yesterday
her
face
lighted
with
hope
and
happiness
she
read
no
further
oh
is
owen
splendid
she
breathed
he
knew
just
what
to
do
and
with
the
letter
in
her
hand
she
ran
out
to
the
veranda
harry
harry
she
called
across
the
garden
there
was
no
answer
run
up
to
marvin
room
and
see
if
he
is
there
margaret
bemis
go
out
and
see
if
he
is
at
the
garage
no
miss
marvin
said
bemis
he
has
gone
into
westbury
pauline
stood
silent
for
a
moment
well
then
i
must
go
myself
she
said
with
quick
decision
she
sped
upstairs
and
within
a
few
minutes
was
out
at
the
garage
in
her
motoring
dress
a
mechanic
was
working
over
her
racing
car
in
front
of
the
garage
the
racing
car
that
was
just
recovering
from
recent
calamity
in
the
international
race
is
it
all
fixed
employ
can
i
drive
it
today
she
asked
eagerly
why
yes
you
could
said
the
mechanic
but
i
have
got
it
polished
up
yet
that
does
matter
in
the
least
i
want
to
use
it
to
day
now
she
sprang
lightly
to
the
seat
of
the
lithe
racer
and
in
a
moment
was
away
down
the
drive
no
myrtle
avenue
was
an
address
a
little
difficult
to
find
myrtle
avenue
was
well
outside
the
new
town
and
pauline
had
made
several
inquiries
before
an
elderly
man
whom
she
found
in
the
telegraph
office
volunteered
directions
she
thanked
him
and
drove
back
for
two
miles
before
she
found
the
turn
he
had
indicated
the
appearance
of
the
place
was
unprepossessing
enough
to
dampen
even
the
ambitious
courage
of
pauline
but
the
sight
of
woman
on
the
porch
training
a
vine
over
the
front
door
allayed
her
fears
you
are
sheila
you
sent
me
a
message
that
you
had
found
my
dog
she
asked
approaching
for
a
moment
the
confusion
that
the
woman
had
meant
to
simulate
was
sincere
she
had
expected
to
see
no
such
vision
as
that
of
pauline
on
the
blackened
steps
of
the
coiners
den
a
dog
she
quavered
vaguely
then
oh
yes
my
dear
little
lady
the
pretty
white
dog
he
came
to
us
yesterday
my
son
he
brought
me
the
newspaper
and
oh
you
are
just
a
dear
cried
pauline
may
i
see
him
now
i
am
so
fond
of
him
yes
my
little
lady
will
you
come
in
pauline
followed
her
into
the
basement
she
stepped
back
with
a
tremor
of
suspicion
as
the
woman
rapped
three
times
upon
the
folding
doors
and
they
opened
silently
on
their
oiled
rails
but
she
was
inside
the
narrow
passage
and
the
light
that
gleamed
through
the
second
pair
of
doors
allayed
her
anxiety
with
a
bow
and
the
wave
of
a
directing
hand
the
old
woman
waited
for
pauline
to
enter
in
a
breath
she
was
seized
from
both
sides
strong
cruel
hands
held
her
while
wallace
smothered
her
cries
with
a
bandage
she
had
hardly
had
time
to
see
the
little
terrier
tugging
at
his
chain
in
the
corner
of
the
room
but
his
wild
barking
was
all
she
knew
of
possible
assistance
in
the
plight
in
which
she
found
herself
they
laid
her
on
the
floor
she
heard
a
voice
that
seemed
strangely
familiar
giving
abrupt
orders
pauline
sought
in
vain
to
place
the
memory
of
the
voice
of
balthazar
the
gypsy
suddenly
she
heard
cries
the
barking
of
the
dog
had
stopped
and
there
was
the
thud
of
heavy
foot
steps
on
the
stone
floor
of
the
cellar
catch
him
shoot
if
you
have
to
came
the
command
in
the
mysteriously
familiar
voice
she
felt
that
her
captors
were
no
longer
near
there
was
a
beat
of
rushing
on
the
floor
it
was
several
minutes
before
she
heard
voices
again
the
cur
has
been
there
long
enough
to
know
her
it
wo
make
any
difference
said
wallace
coming
through
the
open
doors
but
sorry
it
got
away
where
is
miss
pauline
asked
harry
as
he
entered
the
house
on
his
return
from
westbury
she
has
found
her
dog
sir
answered
margaret
smiling
she
went
to
get
him
with
the
racing
car
his
brow
darkened
the
advertisement
was
answered
you
mean
margaret
i
think
so
sir
an
hour
later
he
walked
into
the
garden
and
sat
down
on
the
rustic
bench
where
he
and
pauline
had
quarreled
he
had
just
taken
up
his
newspaper
when
he
was
startled
by
the
spring
of
a
small
warm
body
fairly
into
his
face
lowering
the
torn
paper
he
saw
pauline
dog
cavorting
around
the
bench
in
circles
of
excitement
the
animal
rushed
towards
him
again
but
did
not
leap
this
time
it
came
very
near
and
with
braced
feet
began
to
bark
wildly
harry
stood
up
the
dog
with
another
volley
of
barks
started
towards
the
gate
harry
followed
instinctively
the
terrier
dashed
ahead
of
him
reached
the
gate
returned
renewed
the
appealing
barks
and
again
led
the
way
in
another
minute
harry
was
following
the
urgent
little
guide
he
was
thoroughly
stirred
now
as
the
dog
returned
to
him
the
second
time
with
its
appealing
yelps
he
quickened
his
speed
after
traversing
five
miles
of
road
they
reached
a
certain
house
on
the
thoroughfare
which
still
carried
the
dignity
of
myrtle
avenue
the
dog
rushed
up
the
steps
harry
following
closely
was
surprised
to
find
the
door
was
ajar
he
entered
and
found
himself
in
the
cellar
passageway
a
sound
outside
made
him
grasp
the
broken
rope
on
the
collar
of
the
dog
it
was
an
automobile
wheezing
to
a
stop
and
it
was
followed
by
the
sound
of
voices
the
outer
door
opened
harry
drew
the
dog
aside
into
the
darkness
and
held
its
muzzle
tight
four
men
entered
one
rapped
on
the
wall
and
the
panels
opened
softly
the
man
went
in
harry
hand
had
fallen
on
a
slim
stick
as
he
stooped
in
the
darkness
and
he
slipped
the
stick
into
the
aperture
between
the
folding
doors
he
carried
the
dog
to
the
outer
door
and
thrust
it
through
then
he
came
back
who
is
the
woman
asked
a
gruff
voice
she
does
not
concern
you
have
you
distributed
all
of
the
coins
all
but
she
a
peach
ai
she
the
door
crashed
at
their
heels
harry
was
in
the
room
he
had
gripped
wallace
by
the
throat
before
the
man
could
stir
the
others
backed
toward
their
hidden
weapons
shots
blazed
in
the
room
but
the
smoke
was
protection
for
harry
swinging
wildly
at
whomsoever
he
saw
you
there
polly
yes
she
gasped
tugging
at
her
bonds
in
desperation
she
was
almost
free
harry
had
wallace
at
his
feet
and
wallace
gun
was
in
his
hand
he
blazed
blindly
through
room
a
shriek
told
of
one
man
gone
pauline
felt
strong
hands
grasp
her
she
was
whisked
through
the
door
through
the
outer
door
and
away
into
the
fresh
air
and
into
the
waiting
automobile
she
felt
harry
hot
breath
on
her
fore
head
as
they
sped
in
flight
there
was
clamor
behind
them
for
a
moment
car
was
starting
then
came
only
the
thrash
of
footsteps
through
the
grassy
road
as
the
coiners
rushed
to
their
own
machine
one
stern
command
reached
the
ears
of
pauline
and
harry
as
they
sped
on
it
your
lives
or
theirs
get
them
or
kill
yourselves
it
no
use
polly
come
cried
harry
after
a
time
his
voice
sounded
grim
peremptory
the
machine
with
a
sudden
swerve
had
gone
almost
off
the
road
with
an
exploded
tire
it
was
only
harry
powerful
hand
that
had
saved
them
from
wreck
but
as
he
helped
pauline
out
and
led
her
on
a
run
into
the
forest
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
pursuing
machine
coming
to
a
stop
and
the
tumult
of
voices
behind
them
he
knew
that
one
peril
had
only
been
supplanted
by
another
where
where
are
we
going
harry
the
gorman
camp
if
we
can
make
it
if
we
can
reach
the
river
there
the
old
quarry
she
exclaimed
as
they
came
out
on
the
crest
of
a
cliff
overlooking
a
stream
i
know
their
camp
is
near
the
quarry
but
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
do
talk
run
he
pleaded
leading
her
down
a
footpath
that
traced
a
winding
way
over
the
face
of
the
cliff
into
the
quarry
in
the
shelter
of
the
rocks
there
stood
two
small
buildings
about
five
hundred
yards
apart
one
was
the
old
tool
house
of
the
deserted
quarry
the
other
was
a
hunter
hut
evidently
newly
built
a
commanding
cry
came
from
the
top
of
the
cliff
halt
or
we
fire
they
ran
on
a
shot
echoed
and
a
bullet
flattened
itself
against
the
stone
base
of
the
quarry
not
two
yards
from
pauline
in
here
quick
said
harry
dragging
her
to
the
hunter
lodge
and
thrusting
her
through
the
open
door
there
was
another
shot
and
the
thud
of
another
bullet
as
he
slammed
the
door
it
looks
like
a
fight
now
polly
he
said
as
he
moved
quickly
around
the
hut
and
thank
heaven
here
something
to
fight
with
from
a
rack
in
the
wall
he
lifted
down
a
winchester
rifle
and
a
belt
of
cartridges
get
into
the
corner
and
lie
down
he
ordered
no
give
me
the
revolver
cried
pauline
she
did
not
wait
for
his
protest
but
drew
from
hilt
coat
pocket
the
pistol
he
had
wrested
from
wallace
for
an
instant
he
looked
at
her
with
mingled
admiration
love
and
fear
he
opened
the
little
window
of
the
hut
aimed
and
fired
three
shots
at
the
group
of
six
men
who
were
running
down
the
cliff
path
into
the
tool
house
ordered
balthazar
stopping
only
for
a
glance
at
one
of
his
fellows
who
had
fallen
the
five
gained
the
workmen
hut
and
burst
the
door
open
immediately
from
the
air
hole
and
the
wide
chinks
in
the
sagging
walls
came
a
blaze
of
shots
a
small
white
dog
ran
down
the
path
into
the
quarry
but
no
one
saw
it
balthazar
was
searching
the
ha
he
exclaimed
suddenly
that
is
what
we
want
he
lifted
from
the
floor
a
box
of
blasting
powder
but
the
next
instant
he
dropped
it
and
sprawled
cursing
beside
the
contents
another
man
shot
through
the
body
had
fallen
over
his
leader
balthazar
quickly
recovered
himself
he
whisked
about
the
hut
and
found
a
coil
of
fuse
the
shots
were
still
dinning
in
his
ears
while
he
fashioned
with
the
powder
and
the
box
and
the
fuse
a
bomb
powerful
enough
to
have
shattered
tons
of
imbedded
stone
stop
shooting
he
commanded
here
a
better
way
as
he
suddenly
threw
open
the
door
and
dashed
out
he
nearly
fell
over
the
dog
whining
in
terror
but
balthazar
kept
on
in
a
better
business
with
a
heart
in
him
he
would
have
been
counted
among
the
bravest
of
men
running
a
swaying
zigzag
course
in
the
very
face
of
the
fire
of
harry
and
pauline
he
reached
the
hunter
hut
and
dropped
the
bomb
beside
it
he
did
not
try
to
return
with
the
long
fuse
in
his
hand
he
moved
into
shelter
behind
the
hut
struck
a
match
lighted
the
fuse
and
fled
toward
the
river
after
him
ran
the
small
white
dog
balthazar
turned
and
uttered
a
scream
of
rage
he
dashed
at
the
animal
which
dodged
and
passed
him
in
its
teeth
it
held
the
bomb
he
had
just
laid
at
the
risk
of
his
life
the
fuse
was
sputtering
behind
as
the
dog
fled
balthazar
pursued
desperately
the
path
to
the
river
led
through
a
narrow
defile
of
rock
but
the
beast
was
not
trapped
at
the
edge
as
the
gypsy
had
expected
it
took
to
the
water
with
a
wide
plunge
balthazar
turned
away
cursing
he
rushed
back
to
the
huts
the
guns
and
pistols
were
silent
he
picked
up
from
the
side
of
the
path
a
huge
piece
of
wood
as
he
neared
his
companions
he
shouted
come
out
rush
them
you
cowards
follow
me
harry
fired
his
last
two
shots
and
two
men
fell
pauline
had
long
ago
emptied
the
revolver
three
men
came
on
there
was
a
crash
as
the
log
in
balthazar
mighty
hands
beat
down
the
door
and
he
staggered
through
but
harry
was
upon
him
he
hurled
the
gypsy
across
the
room
he
charged
at
the
others
and
one
went
down
through
the
door
came
four
men
it
harry
help
him
cried
pauline
balthazar
charged
straight
at
the
newcomers
but
he
did
not
attempt
to
fight
he
was
out
through
the
door
and
away
to
the
river
before
they
could
intercept
him
within
a
few
moments
his
companions
lay
bound
on
the
hut
floor
but
how
did
you
find
out
how
did
you
know
we
needed
you
asked
pauline
afterward
of
young
richard
gorman
whose
camping
party
had
been
the
rescuers
that
the
girl
who
told
us
he
said
pointing
to
a
dejected
little
bull
terrier
that
stood
quaking
with
excitement
a
few
feet
away
cyrus
cried
pauline
running
and
clutching
the
little
terrier
in
her
arms
yes
he
brought
us
the
dead
bomb
and
we
knew
something
was
up
chapter
xxi
the
guest
of
honor
well
prove
it
said
harry
show
me
that
you
mean
it
why
harry
what
a
woman
says
she
always
means
always
means
not
to
do
but
harry
really
i
going
to
be
good
this
time
pleaded
pauline
they
were
emerging
from
the
gate
of
the
marvin
mansion
to
the
avenue
and
as
harry
turned
to
pauline
with
a
skeptical
reply
on
his
lips
the
approach
of
a
young
man
of
military
bearing
stopped
him
by
jove
is
that
who
the
deuce
is
it
why
benny
summers
the
young
man
was
hurrying
by
without
recognition
when
harry
called
sharply
hello
ben
harry
harry
marvin
by
the
coin
of
croesus
is
it
really
you
no
said
harry
grasping
his
hand
not
the
you
used
to
know
i
been
driven
into
premature
old
age
by
caring
for
a
militant
sister
polly
this
is
ensign
summers
of
the
navy
please
promise
me
that
you
wo
get
him
into
danger
because
he
used
to
be
a
friend
of
mine
he
has
never
done
anything
more
dangerous
than
run
a
submarine
and
shoot
torpedoes
out
of
it
in
a
field
of
mines
a
submarine
torpedoes
cried
pauline
is

beautiful
but
benny

line

the
word

one
that
would
blow
well
i
got
it
congratulations
felicitations
laudatory
remarks
and
enthusiasm
cried
harry
without
having
slightest
idea
what
a
torpedo
is
i
rejoice
with
you
come
on
back
to
the
house
and
tell
us
about
it
i
sorry

for
a
conference
with
the
naval
board
and
i

but

and
miss
marvin
come
to
luncheon
with
me
tomorrow
why
not
you
with
us
we
saw
you
first
summers
laughed
well
for
this
reason
i
want
you
to
meet
mlle
de
longeon
who
will
preside
at
this
particular
luncheon
and
who
is
the
flush
that
came
suddenly
to
the
cheeks
of
the
young
officer
brought
involuntary
laughter
from
harry
and
pauline
i
take
that
as
an
acceptance
the
kerrimore
east
street
he
called
sharing
in
their
laughter
as
he
fled
but
at
the
gate
of
the
marvin
house
he
came
upon
raymond
owen
there
was
a
hasty
clasp
of
hands
and
you
to
come
too
cried
summers
continuing
his
flight
where
am
i
to
come
asked
owen
as
he
approached
harry
and
pauline
to
luncheon
with
ensign
summers
tomorrow
is
he
dear
i
love
men
who
blush
they
seem
so
innocent
the
fates
defend
us
implored
harry
ensign
summers
had
gained
a
position
beyond
his
rank
in
the
navy
a
natural
bent
toward
science
and
a
patriotic
bent
toward
the
use
of
science
as
a
means
of
national
defense
had
inspired
him
to
experiments
which
had
resulted
in
success
amazing
even
to
himself
he
had
been
allowed
during
the
year
preceding
the
meeting
with
harry
and
pauline
a
leave
of
absence
in
that
time
he
had
visited
italy
france
england
and
germany
and
had
studied
under
naval
experts
he
had
come
back
home
with
his
own
little
idea
undiminished
in
its
importance
to
his
own
mind
and
he
had
proceeded
with
youthful
enthusiasm
and
effrontery
to
prove
its
importance
to
the
highest
of
his
commanders
the
tests
now
about
to
be
made
tests
of
a
new
torpedo
gun
and
new
torpedo
had
been
ordered
by
the
mightiest
in
the
land
triumphant
in
his
discovery
and
wealthy
in
his
own
right
summers
was
the
happiest
of
men
it
was
in
paris
that
he
had
met
mlle
del
longeon
exquisitely
beautiful
of
the
alluring
and
languorous
type
quick
of
wit
tactful
and
with
great
charm
of
manner
she
had
completely
fascinated
the
young
officer
he
had
vowed
his
adoration
of
her
almost
before
he
knew
her
his
avowals
had
been
repulsed
with
just
that
margin
of
insincerity
that
would
double
his
ardor
it
had
required
many
letters
to
induce
mlle
de
longeon
to
leave
her
beloved
paris
and
visit
friends
in
america
summers
knew
she
was
not
a
frenchwoman
but
he
was
totally
in
the
dark
as
to
what
was
her
nationality
summers
did
care
he
was
madly
mad
in
love
with
her
and
there
was
no
other
thing
to
consider
it
was
for
this
reason
that
mlle
de
longeon
was
the
guest
of
honor
at
the
little
luncheon
in
his
rooms
to
which
he
had
invited
harry
and
pauline
the
affair
was
quite
informal
there
were
a
number
of
navy
men
present
a
few
young
married
people
the
atmosphere
of
the
gathering
was
sublimely
innocuous
as
mlle
de
longeon
remarked
to
summers
in
the
hall
after
the
guests
had
departed
but
mlle
de
longeon
had
met
one
guest
who
did
not
impress
her
as
innocuous
or
sublime
raymond
owen
pauline
had
presented
the
secretary
on
his
arrival
and
owen
had
immediately
devoted
himself
to
her
not
long
after
luncheon
was
served
the
voice
of
mlle
de
longeon
rose
suddenly
above
the
general
talk
but
summers
you
have
not
told
us
yet
of
your
new
invention
when
shall
the
plans
be
ready
when
shall
you
rise
to
the
realization
of
your
true
success
summers
beamed
his
happiness
in
the
face
of
the
brazen
compliment
like
the
good
and
silly
boy
he
was
i
supposed
to
keep
this
secret
he
answered
but
i
can
trust
every
one
here
i
know
the
plans
are
going
to
be
sent
out
day
after
tomorrow
you
mean
you
will
have
them
completed
all
those
intricate
plans
queried
mlle
de
longeon
in
a
tone
of
breathless
admiration
i
work
all
tonight
and
most
of
tomorrow
but
of
course
it
only
a
case
of
putting
into
words
ideas
that
have
already
been
put
into
solid
metal
my
gun
and
torpedo
are
ready
for
work
it
is
so
very
difficult
and
it
well
it
a
lot
of
fun
and
great
honor
paid
the
woman
he
loved
for
a
moment
their
eyes
met
but
only
for
a
moment
the
next
catin
the
valet
who
was
taking
charge
of
the
luncheon
under
pretense
of
anticipating
a
waiter
moved
quickly
to
fill
her
wine
glass
even
the
subtle
eye
of
owen
was
not
sharp
enough
to
see
mlle
de
longeon
pass
him
a
crushed
slip
of
paper
and
she
had
been
too
long
trained
to
concealment
of
even
the
simplest
emotions
to
betray
uneasiness
now
nevertheless
there
was
the
possibility
of
surprising
mlle
de
longeon
and
that
possibility
was
realized
as
she
glanced
at
raymond
owen
his
set
tense
face
reflected
for
the
moment
all
his
hatred
of
harry
and
pauline
who
were
talking
blithely
with
ensign
summers
another
naval
officer
and
two
of
the
wives
of
the
civilian
visitors
she
turned
to
him
with
a
suddenness
that
would
have
seemed
abrupt
in
the
manner
of
one
less
beautiful
owen
do
come
to
see
me
she
said
i
am
sure
at
least
i
think
i
am
sure
that
we
have
many
matters
of
mutual
interest
in
her
softly
modulated
tones
the
invitation
had
no
significance
beyond
the
literal
meaning
of
the
words
it
will
be
an
honor
he
answered
tomorrow
evening
then
delighted
and
later
the
naval
ball
no
i
afraid
the
ensign
will
not
permit
any
one
else
to
take
me
to
the
ball
but
we
shall
meet
there
afterward
in
a
new
york
street
among
the
lower
there
was
at
that
time
a
foreign
agency
that
was
not
a
consulate
but
was
visited
by
diplomats
of
the
highest
rank
in
a
certain
nation
the
name
of
which
or
the
mystery
of
whose
suspicions
need
not
be
touched
upon
there
was
no
regular
staff
at
the
agency
the
rooms
were
maintained
under
the
name
of
a
certain
foreign
gentleman
or
rather
under
the
name
that
he
chose
to
assume
there
were
two
servants
but
they
saw
little
of
the
master
of
the
house
he
was
seldom
at
home
but
when
he
was
he
had
many
visitors
an
hour
after
the
luncheon
in
the
rooms
of
ensign
summers
the
master
of
the
mysterious
dwelling
was
at
home
and
he
had
four
guests
it
would
have
greatly
surprised
ensign
summers
had
he
known
that
one
of
the
diplomat
guests
was
his
own
man
servant
catin
it
is
the
worst
duty
i
have
ever
had
to
perform
the
diplomat
said
solemnly
it
means
almost
certainly
your
death
but
it
is
death
for
your
country
it
is
the
command
of
your
country
the
submarine
must
be
destroyed
and
the
plans
we
shall
get
the
plans
through
another
agent
i
am
not
afraid
to
die
said
catin
then
here
is
the
model
of
a
submarine
not
of
the
one
you
will
enter
of
course
but
it
will
give
you
an
idea
i
have
marked
the
place
where
you
will
secrete
the
explosive
until
the
proper
moment
i
have
also
indicated
the
position
for
you
to
take
in
order
to
have
some
faint
chance
of
reaching
the
surface
and
being
saved
one
of
the
other
men
stepped
forward
and
handed
catin
a
small
square
box
this
is
the
explosive
you
know
how
to
handle
it
with
a
military
salute
catin
turned
and
left
the
place
within
half
an
hour
he
was
carefully
brushing
ensign
summers
clothes
as
summers
came
in
would
it
be
too
much
to
ask
sir
inquired
the
perfect
valet
that
i
might
accompany
you
in
the
submarine
i
am
afraid
you
will
be
very
uncomfortable
without
me
summers
laughed
it
impossible
catin
this
boat
is
a
government
secret
in
itself
and
my
new
torpedo
makes
it
a
double
secret
no
one
but
a
picked
crew
will
be
allowed
on
it
except
sir
well
i
admit
i
could
command
it
but
it
would
be
very
unwise
catin
and
i
assure
you
i
shall
get
along
all
right
mlle
de
longeon
apartment
was
characteristic
of
the
lady
herself
the
artist
would
have
found
it
a
little
too
luxurious
for
good
taste
a
little
in
the
richness
of
draperies
the
heavy
scent
of
flowers
the
subtleties
of
divans
there
was
something
more
than
feminine
something
feline
to
raymond
owen
however
it
was
ideal
the
dimmed
ruby
lights
the
suggestive
shadows
of
the
tapestries
were
in
tune
with
the
surreptitious
mind
of
the
secretary
but
there
remained
for
him
a
picture
that
he
admired
more
mlle
de
longeon
coming
through
the
portieres
with
a
cry
of
pleasure
i
am
so
glad
you
came
and
so
sorry
i
must
send
you
away
quickly
exclaimed
mlle
de
longeon
the
little
ensign
has
telephoned
that
he
is
coming
early
to
take
me
for
a
drive
before
the
ball
i
can
come
again
if
i
may
have
the
honor
said
owen
rising
quickly
oh
there
is
time
for
a
word
she
said
smiling
there
was
something
you
wished
to
say
to
me
was
there
not
something
you
did
not
care
to
say
at
the
luncheon
yesterday
yes
why
do
you
hate
miss
marvin
owen
was
silent
for
a
moment
why
do
you
hate
the
little
ensign
as
you
call
another
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
we
can
be
of
service
to
one
another
in
all
likelihood
and
that
therefore
we
should
be
frank
friends
you
wish
to
have
pauline
marvin
out
of
the
way
do
you
not
how
did
you
find
that
out
people
engaged
in
similar
business
find
out
many
things
now
i
wish
to
be
rid
of
ensign
summers
precisely
you
are
an
international
agent
yes
and
i
offer
you
my
aid
and
the
aid
of
the
powerful
men
i
control
in
return
for
your
aid
to
me
and
them
is
it
a
bargain
they
were
seated
on
one
of
the
curtained
divans
a
light
above
them
she
leaned
forward
her
long
delicate
hand
touched
his
a
splendid
jewel
at
her
throat
heightened
the
magic
of
her
beauty
because
it
is
my
business
to
hate
him
and
make
love
to
him
at
the
same
time
come
owen
let
us
be
frank
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
owen
felt
himself
mastered
by
the
sheer
fascination
of
a
woman
what
am
i
to
do
he
said
breathlessly
i
will
tell
you
tonight
at
the
ball
now
you
must
run
away
he
arose
instantly
but
as
she
stood
beside
him
he
turned
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
passionately
she
protested
with
a
little
cry
and
a
struggle
not
too
violent
to
damage
her
coiffure
he
drew
back
from
her
there
was
something
of
astonishment
in
his
eyes
astonishment
at
himself
you
are
the
only
woman
in
the
world
who
ever
made
me
do
that
he
gasped
go
go
she
pleaded
but
you
are
angry
you
break
our
agreement
no
but
i
am
overcome
i
shall
meet
you
tonight
he
caught
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
hurried
from
the
house
it
was
more
than
an
hour
after
he
observed
her
arrival
at
the
naval
ball
before
owen
had
the
privilege
of
a
greeting
from
mlle
de
longeon
and
then
it
was
only
a
smile
as
she
passed
him
on
the
arm
of
a
distinguished
looking
foreign
diplomat
owen
saw
that
she
spoke
a
quiet
word
to
her
escort
who
turned
and
looked
at
owen
she
beamed
brightly
at
owen
who
smiled
back
at
her
and
moved
slowly
toward
the
door
of
the
conservatory
into
which
she
and
the
diplomat
had
disappeared
he
was
surprised
a
moment
later
to
see
pauline
rush
by
him
with
a
little
laugh
is
anything
the
matter
owen
called
nothing
you
can
help
stay
right
where
you
are
she
cried
owen
laughed
his
understanding
and
moved
over
to
where
harry
and
lucille
were
talking
with
ensign
summers
meanwhile
pauline
in
the
darkest
recess
of
the
conservatory
was
pinning
together
a
broken
garter
as
she
started
back
to
the
ballroom
she
was
surprised
to
hear
voices
near
her
there
was
something
about
their
foreign
accent
that
roused
the
interest
of
pauline
she
crept
along
a
row
of
palms
and
peered
through
an
aperture
mlle
de
longeon
and
the
diplomat
were
talking
together
as
they
paced
the
aisle
of
palms
on
the
other
side
pauline
crept
nearer
presently
the
voice
of
the
diplomat
became
distinguishable
it
is
all
arranged
the
thing
is
to
be
done
in
submarine
tomorrow
all
you
have
now
to
do
is
pauline
could
not
catch
the
final
words
the
two
moved
back
to
the
ballroom
she
followed
close
behind
a
little
suspicious
but
with
the
thrill
of
a
new
plan
gripping
her
she
saw
ensign
summers
step
forward
early
to
greet
mile
de
longeon
another
dance
was
beginning
this
one
is
owen
said
mile
de
longeon
as
she
moved
away
on
the
arm
of
the
secretary
have
you
anything
to
tell
me
he
asked
yes
induce
her
to
make
summers
take
her
down
in
his
submarine
tomorrow
and
she
will
never
trouble
you
again
as
the
dance
ended
pauline
and
harry
summers
and
lucille
joined
them
summers
i
have
a
great
request
to
make
declared
pauline
i
grant
it
before
you
breathe
a
word
he

be
began
summers
it
must
be
she
commanded
well
i
promised
too
soon
but
i
keep
my
word
owen
and
mile
de
longeon
had
stepped
aside
what
does
it
mean
gasped
the
secretary
she
is
doing
the
very
thing
we
want
her
to
do
sometimes
fate
aids
the
worthy
said
mile
de

softly
chapter
xxii
submarine
at
the
dock
of
the
navy
yard
a
submarine
lay
ready
for
departure
there
was
nothing
about
its
appearance
to
indicate
that
its
mission
was
of
more
than
ordinary
importance
but
it
was
an
unusual
thing
to
see
a
woman
aboard
and
the
curiosity
of
the
crew
was
matched
by
that
of
the
young
officers
who
had
come
down
to
see
summers
off
on
his
voyage
of
many
chances
the
officers
got
little
reward
for
their
considerate
interest
ensign
summers
was
engaged
he
was
explaining
to
pauline
as
they
stood
on
the
deck
of
the
the
entire
history
of
submarines
from
the
time
of
caesar
or
washington
or
somebody
to
the
present
day
and
pauline
was
listening
with
that
childlike
simplicity
which
women
use
for
the
purpose
of
making
men
look
foolish
by
jove
i
thought
he
was
tied
heart
and
hope
to
the
lovely
foreigner
exclaimed
one
of
the
shoreward
observers
so
he
is
said
another
but
mlle
de
longeon
is
interested
in
his
daily
toil
do
you
know
who
the
young
lady
up
there
is
no
she
must
have
got
a
dispensation
from
the
secretary
himself
to
go
on
this
trip
so
she
did
easy
as
snapping
your
thumb
she
miss
pauline
marvin
daughter
of
the
richest
man
that
has
died
in
twenty
years
the
boat
gong
sounded
the
signal
of
departure
summers
with
a
hasty
apology
left
pauline
and
stepped
forward
the
engines
began
to
rumble
the
deadly
and
delicate
craft
masterpiece
of
modern
naval
achievement
drew
slowly
from
the
pier
there
was
a
shout
summers
delivering
rapid
orders
on
deck
turned
with
an
expression
of
annoyance
to
see
his
faithful
man
servant
catin
out
of
breath
and
excited
rushing
toward
the
boat
summers
ordered
the
vessel
stopped
it
had
moved
not
more
than
stepping
distance
from
the
pier
and
in
a
moment
catin
was
beside
his
master
on
the
deck
she
told
me
it
must
he
paused
gasping
for
breath
who
told
you
what
demanded
summers
mlle
de
longeon
i
am
sure
it
is
a
message
of
importance
she
told
me
i
must
give
it
to
you
before
you
risked
your
life
on
the
voyage
mlle
de
longeon
he
caught
the
letter
from
catin
hand
my
hero
i
can
not
keep
the
secret
any
longer
can
not
wait
to
tell
you
that
it
is
you
i
love
estelle
de
longeon
summers
walked
slowly
dizzily
up
the
deck
was
in
an
ecstasy
he
was
oblivious
to
all
the
world
even
to
pauline
who
stood
questioning
an
officer
at
the
rail
the
fact
that
his
servant
catin
slipped
silently
down
the
hatchway
to
the
main
compartment
and
thence
on
to
the
pump
room
at
the
vessel
bottom
would
hardly
have
interested
him
if
he
had
known
it
shall
we
put
off
sir
the
second
officer
saluted
the
ensign
came
to
himself
instantly
yes
of
course
i
put
back
only
for
an
important
message
he
said
my
man
got
off
did
he
i
think
so
all
right
go
ahead
catin
with
that
rare
fortune
which
sometimes
favors
the
wicked
had
chosen
precisely
the
right
moment
for
his
ruse
the
crew
of
the
submarine
were
all
on
deck
save
those
in
the
engine
room
and
his
quick
passage
to
the
vitals
of
the
vessel
was
unseen
once
in
the
pump
room
he
hastily
drew
from
under
his
coat
the
bomb
placed
in
his
hands
at
the
conference
of
diplomats
wound
its
spring
and
laid
it
beside
the
pumps
there
was
a
strange
look
on
the
man
face
as
he
did
this
a
look
at
once
proud
and
pitiful
catin
had
not
sense
of
treachery
or
shame
the
deed
in
itself
did
not
lack
the
dignity
of
courage
for
with
the
others
he
was
planned
his
own
death
and
while
the
others
were
to
die
suddenly
ignorant
of
their
peril
catin
was
to
die
in
deliberate
knowledge
of
it
on
deck
pauline
was
eagerly
questioning
an
under
officer
about
the
torpedoes
when
summers
came
up
you
have
to
come
down
and
see
for
yourself
he
said
overhearing
her
first
i
show
you
the
pump
room
the
most
important
part
of
us
he
was
saying
as
catin
in
the
boat
bottom
first
caught
the
sound
of
nearing
voices
catin
leaped
up
the
steps
from
the
pump
room
he
was
in
the
nick
of
time
a
large
locker
in
the
main
compartment
gave
him
refuge
just
as
pauline
and
summers
reached
the
room
the
pumps
are
our
said
summers
as
he
directed
pauline
down
the
second
ladder
if
they
go
wrong
when
we
under
water
we
ca
come
up
and
what
do
you
do
then
asked
pauline
innocently
oh
down
catin
waited
breathless
in
his
hiding
place
until
they
returned
by
heaven
they
did
find
it
he
breathed
eagerly
pauline
and
ensign
summers
stood
at
the
rail
watching
the
foamy
rush
of
a
fast
motor
boat
when
a
hail
sounded
across
the
water
a
man
was
standing
up
in
the
motor
boat
and
calling
through
a
megaphone
summers
raised
his
glasses
do
you
know
who
that
is
he
asked
laughingly
of
course
not
what
does
he
want
it
harry
and
i
suspect
he
wants
to
take
you
away
from
us
pauline
uttered
an
exclamation
of
annoyance
is
he
silly
she
cried
one
would
think
i
was
a
baby
the
way
he
watches
me
soon
the
voice
of
harry
could
be
plainly
distinguished
clear
your
ship
i
am
going
to
sink
you
he
called
cargo
too
precious
this
trip
do
do
it
answered
summers
let
me
take
the
megaphone
demanded
pauline
what
do
you
mean
by
following
us
she
cried
i
do
trust
that
sardine
can
and
i
want
a
regular
boat
on
hand
when
you
are
wrecked
i
am
very
angry
with
you
it
looks
as
if
her
words
were
drowned
in
summers
laughter
never
mind
i
know
a
way
we
can
escape
from
him
he
said
how
why
sink
the
boat
that
will
be
splendid
he
stepped
aside
and
gave
a
terse
order
delightedly
pauline
watched
the
brief
movements
of
the
crew
trimming
the
deck
summers
escorted
her
back
to
the
conning
tower
they
descended
within
a
few
moments
the
wonderful
craft
was
buried
under
the
waves
there
he
is
looking
for
us
laughed
summers
as
he
made
room
for
pauline
at
the
periscope
amazed
fascinated
she
gazed
from
what
seemed
the
bottom
of
the
sea
out
upon
the
rolling
surface
of
the
waves
harry
motorboat
was
near
and
he
was
standing
in
the
bow
scanning
the
water
with
binoculars
and
he
ca
see
us
asked
pauline
oh
yes
he
pick
up
out
periscope
after
a
while
shall
we
fire
the
torpedo
at
him
yes
please
said
pauline
summers
laugh
was
cut
short
as
if
someone
had
taken
his
jest
in
earnest
and
really
fired
a
projectile
the
crash
of
an
explosion
came
from
the
bottom
of
the
boat
stay
here
ordered
summers
with
a
set
face
as
he
joined
the
rush
of
seamen
into
the
pump
room
but
pauline
followed
an
officer
with
blanched
face
but
steady
voice
came
up
to
summers
what
was
it
grimes
it
seems
to
have
been
a
bomb
sir
there
was
no
powder
down
there
the
face
of
the
ensign
darkened
with
suspicion
and
alarm
a
bomb
so
they
were
going
after
us
the
enemy
we
better
get
right
up
and
back
to
port
grimes
i
have
to
report
sir
the
pumps
are
disabled
summers
turned
with
a
look
of
pity
toward
pauline
who
stood
at
his
elbow
and
we
ca
get
up
again
she
questioned
there
is
one
chance
but
he
stopped
openly
and
listened
open
that
locker
he
commanded
a
seaman
pulled
back
the
door
of
the
locker
and
disclosed
the
cringing
form
and
defiant
face
of
catin
catin
you
the
man
stepped
forward
with
a
smile
of
triumph
you
set
off
the
bomb
you
wanted
to
kill
me
i
did
my
duty
i
obeyed
my
orders
as
you
obey
your
orders
i
had
no
enmity
for
you
i
am
in
fact
sorry
that
you
were
fool
enough
not
to
see
that
i
was
a
little
more
than
a
valet
you
are
a
spy
catin
yes
sir
and
i
have
done
my
work
and
i
am
willing
to
die
with
the
rest
of
you
pauline
drew
back
shuddering
she
touched
summers
arm
oh
summers
i
believe
what
is
it
i
believe
i
know
of
the
plot
i
was
in
the
conservatory
at
the
naval
ball
a
man
and
a
woman
a
woman
mlle
de
longeon
and
her
diplomatic
friend
you
remember
yes
well
they
talked
together
in
whispers
the
man
said
thing
will
be
done
on
submarine
tomorrow
a
look
of
agony
that
the
fear
of
death
could
not
have
caused
came
into
the
face
of
the
young
ensign
mlle
de
longeon
no
yes
mlle
de
longeon
sneered
catin
stepping
nearer
mlle
de
longeon
is
the
principal
proof
of
my
statement
that
you
are
a
fool
mlle
de
longeon
recommended
me
to
you
as
a
capable
valet
did
she
not
mlle
de
longeon
frequently
was
your
guest
now
mlle
de
longeon
has
the
plans
of
your
submarine
and
your
torpedo
plans
which
i
took
the
liberty
of
removing
from
the
little
cupboard
over
the
desk
in
your
workroom
summers
sprang
forward
but
he
recovered
himself
i
should
have
told
you
wailed
pauline
how
should
you
have
known
said
summers
in
a
moment
he
had
lost
his
life
work
and
his
love
suddenly
he
straightened
himself
the
soldier
in
him
mastered
the
man
there
is
still
a
chance
one
little
chance
he
said
to
get
out
cried
pauline
yes
through
the
torpedo
tube
she
shuddered
i
am
going
to
make
you
do
it
he
said
because
it
is
the
only
chance
the
men
will
follow
you
harry
boat
will
be
near
and
you
i
do
not
matter
any
more
come
a
gunner
opened
the
great
tube
as
summers
led
pauline
into
the
torpedo
room
obediently
she
entered
the
strange
passageway
of
peril
and
of
hope
goodbye
he
said
and
good
luck
goodbye
she
answered
you
are
a
brave
man
you
are
as
brave
you
are
as
fine
as
harry
from
the
end
of
the
torpedo
tube
a
woman
form
shot
to
the
surface
of
the
water
choking
dazed
but
courageous
pauline
tried
to
turn
on
her
back
and
gain
breath
but
they
were
well
out
to
seat
and
the
waves
were
crushing
what
is
that
asked
harry
pointing
and
passing
his
glasses
to
the
boatman
the
man
looked
and
without
a
word
swung
the
craft
about
and
put
the
engine
at
top
speed
and
in
a
few
moments
harry
strong
arms
drew
her
from
the
water
my
darling
what
has
happened
he
gasped
do
think
of
me
think
of
them
she
begged
weakly
they
were
trapped
down
there
there
was
a
bomb
a
plot
the
machinery
is
ruined
harry
help
them
the
boatman
who
overheard
pauline
first
cry
of
appeal
now
came
forward
respectfully
there
a
revenue
cutter
the
iroquois
coming
out
he
said
significantly
harry
looked
splendid
he
cried
can
we
signal
her
no
but
we
can
catch
her
shouts
from
a
speeding
motorboat
brought
the
government
vessel
to
a
stop
officers
came
to
the
rail
and
helped
harry
and
pauline
to
the
deck
ensign
summers
and
his
crew
are
sunk
in
their
submarine
the
pumps
are
gone
there
was
a
bomb
explosion
can
you
get
help
where
are
they
you
can
pick
up
their
buoy
with
a
glass
there
the
chief
officer
looked
through
his
glass
yes
he
said
come
abroad
or
keep
your
own
boat
we
got
another
piece
of
work
to
do
if
we
can
leave
our
friends
to
your
guarding
said
harry
well
have
the
wrecking
tugs
and
divers
in
twenty
minutes
harry
and
pauline
climbed
back
to
the
motorboat
and
sped
up
the
bay
what
did
you
mean
another
piece
of
work
asked
pauline
as
she
clung
to
his
arm
my
car
is
at
the
navy
yard
pier
was
his
only
answer
she
still
clung
to
him
in
tremulous
uncertainty
as
the
motor
sped
them
up
through
broadway
into
fifth
avenue
and
on
to
the
door
of
mlle
de
longeon
hotel
she
and
the
diplomatic
grandee
who
had
held
the
confidential
conference
with
her
in
the
conservatory
at
the
naval
ball
were
together
in
her
suite
and
you
have
the
plans
actually
in
your
possession
he
said
yes
it
has
been
a
tedious
process
it
was
easy
to
make
him
fall
in
love
but
he
is
so
fearfully
scrupulous
about
his
work
it
took
even
his
valet
three
months
to
locate
the
secret
hiding
place
of
the
papers
a
little
more
caution
mingled
with
his
scruples
and
he
would
not
now
be
dead
at
the
bottom
of
the
bay
oh
this
is
the
day
is
it
asked
mlle
de
longeon
wearily
after
all
it
is
rather
cruel
to
catin
to
die
for
his
country
nonsense
he
dies
because
he
knows
he
would
be
killed
in
a
crueler
way
if
he
refused
to
obey
you
the
diplomat
smiled
will
you
give
me
the
plans
yes
why
marie
what
is
it
a
maid
had
entered
with
cards
i
am
not
at
home
today
mlle
de
longeon
moved
to
her
writing
desk
removed
from
it
a
packet
of
papers
and
with
a
little
courtesy
gave
it
into
the
eager
hands
of
the
diplomat
it
has
been
a
splendid
achievement
mademoiselle
he
said
enthusiastically
i
shall
see
that
what
who
is
this
he
exclaimed
as
harry
and
pauline
burst
into
the
room
marie
marie
i
told
you
that
i
was
at
home
to
no
one
screamed
mlle
de
longeon
how
dare
you
intrude
in
these
apartments
demanded
the
diplomat
i
dare
because
i
want
those
papers
declared
harry
the
packet
was
still
in
the
diplomat
hands
he
tried
to
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
but
harry
was
upon
him
they
clinched
broke
from
each
other
grasp
and
struggled
furiously
as
the
last
resource
the
diplomat
drew
the
packet
from
his
breast
and
flung
it
across
the
room
toward
mlle
de
longeon
she
pounced
upon
it
but
pauline
was
beside
her
stronger
both
in
body
and
in
spirit
than
the
adventuress
she
grasped
her
wrists
and
in
the
luxurious
room
there
raged
two
battles
but
the
struggles
did
not
last
long
harry
hurled
his
antagonist
an
exhausted
wreck
to
the
floor
and
sprang
to
the
side
of
pauline
throwing
off
mlle
de
longeon
grasp
he
picked
up
the
packet
from
the
floor
and
with
pauline
ran
from
the
room
a
revenue
cutter
was
landing
a
group
of
faint
and
silent
men
at
the
pier
of
the
navy
yard
when
an
automobile
flashed
in
hurrah
they
did
it
you
safe
cried
pauline
rushing
past
harry
to
greet
ensign
summers
the
officer
took
her
extended
hands
gratefully
but
there
was
no
light
in
his
eyes
as
he
answered
safe
and
dishonored
he
said
i
am
only
glad
for
my
men
why
dishonored
asked
harry
do
you
understand
the
man
said
pauline
curiously
the
man
who
placed
the
bomb
where
is
he
dead
said
summers
he
broke
the
tube
after
you
were
released
and
then
attacked
me
with
a
knife
i
had
to
kill
him
good
for
you
broke
in
harry
but
what
all
the
gloom
talk
for
this
stuff
about
dishonor
you
proved
yourself
a
hero
man
i
have
lost
the
most
important
documents
of
the
navy
department
through
a
silly
entanglement
with
a
woman
no
you
have
we
went
and
got
them
for
you
said
harry
presenting
the
packet

a
paper
chase
in
balthazar
band
which
had
failed
so
often
do
away
with
pauline
marvin
there
was
nevertheless
one
man
who
had
attracted
the
particular
interest
raymond
owen
louis
wrentz
physically
and
mentally
brutal
he
had
always
been
one
to
oppose
balthazar
delays
six
months
before
owen
would
have
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
employing
this
ruffian
then
his
great
aim
was
to
be
rid
of
pauline
by
the
most
indirect
and
secret
means
but
pauline
escape
a
few
weeks
before
from
mlle
de
longeon
cleverly
planned
plot
the
almost
incredible
rescue
of
the
submarine
and
recovery
of
ensign
summers
torpedo
boat
plans
as
well
as
the
fact
that
the
year
of
adventure
was
rapidly
drawing
to
a
close
and
that
harry
growing
hostility
and
the
increasing
danger
of
exposure
at
the
hands
of
some
one
of
his
aides
made
the
secretary
willing
to
take
every
chance
made
it
imperative
that
he
should
have
a
lieutenant
who
could
be
trusted
to
strike
boldly
owen
sent
for
wrentz
the
man
appeared
in
the
guise
of
a
servant
seeking
employment
and
was
brought
up
to
owen
private
wrentz
i
want
you
to
take
charge
of
my
work
hereafter
said
the
secretary
you
mean
the
work
of
owen
raised
his
hand
in
caution
the
work
of
conducting
a
certain
person
to
a
far
country
but
balthazar
questioned
wrentz
i
am
through
with
balthazar
he
done
nothing
but
procrastinate
all
his
plans
have
failed
because
it
was
to
his
profit
that
they
should
fail
i
do
the
work
quickly
what
your
present
plan
a
very
simple
one
but
one
that
must
be
very
shrewdly
handled
it
will
mean
that
you
and
some
of
your
friends
will
have
to
make
a
trip
to
philadelphia
where
shall
i
be
able
to
call
you
within
a
day
or
two
at
stroob
lodging
house
in
avenue
b
very
well
be
prepared
to
act
on
short
notice
i
stick
close
to
the
place
sir
and
wrentz
understand
that
you
are
also
to
act
firmly
no
balthazar
tactics
i
through
being
tricked
i
sure
i
never
failed
you
sir
said
wrentz
with
an
aggrieved
air
owen
smiled
true
but
temptation
occasionally
leads
even
the
most
honest
of
men
astray
he
said
sarcastically
while
this
last
plot
was
being
hatched
pauline
and
harry
were
playing
chess
in
the
library
as
she
checkmated
him
for
the
third
time
he
arose
in
mock
disgust
they
say
chess
is
a
perfect
mental
test
i
wonder
who
is
the
brains
of
this
family
now
she
taunted
there
a
difference
between
brains
and
you
know
i
lost
because
i
had
that
chicago
thing
on
my
mind
oh
is
that
settled
yet
no
i
expecting
to
be
called
up
any
minute
with
a
message
that
will
send
me
out
there
oh
harry
that
terrible
when
you
go
to
chicago
you
never
get
back
for
a
whole
week
if
you
like
me
so
much
why
do
you
marry
me
and
go
with
me
on
all
my
trips
conceited
she
began
but
her
face
fell
again
as
the
telephone
bell
sounded
harry
answered
it
and
after
a
few
rapid
questions
turned
to
pauline
that
what
it
is
he
said
i
go
tomorrow
i
must
see
owen
and
rang
the
bell
owen
pauline
exclaimed
upon
his
entrance
harry
must
go
to
chicago
tomorrow
is
it
dreadful
i
am
very
sorry
but
i
hope
it
will
not
be
for
long
no
said
harry
curtly
look
over
these
papers
an
hour
later
owen
drew
from
his
typewriter
this
letter
miss
pauline
marvin
carson
brown
publishers
weston
place
philadelphia
new
york
dear
madam
after
reading
your
marine
story
published
in
the
cosmopolitan
magazine
we
have
decided
you
are
just
the
person
to
write
a
new
serial
we
have
in
mind
would
you
be
interested
to
call
on
us
at
your
earliest
opportunity
yours
very
truly
r
carson
owen
sealed
addressed
and
stamped
the
letter
and
enclosed
it
in
a
larger
envelope
which
he
addressed
to
a
friend
in
philadelphia
with
instructions
to
post
the
enclosure
in
that
city
he
did
not
trust
the
mailing
of
the
double
letter
to
a
servant
but
putting
on
his
motor
togs
prepared
to
ride
to
westbury
well
he
got
a
reprieve
he
going
to
stay
with
us
one
more
day
pauline
cried
happily
as
she
met
owen
in
the
hall
for
the
flash
of
an
instant
something
twinged
at
the
cold
heart
of
the
secretary
the
bright
beauty
of
pauline
her
happiness
her
love
for
her
foster
brother
struck
home
the
first
realization
of
something
missing
and
never
to
be
achieved
in
his
grim
existence
perhaps
for
the
moment
raymond
owen
had
a
dim
understanding
of
the
value
of
innocence
the
next
afternoon
pauline
stood
on
the
veranda
bidding
harry
goodbye
i
hate
to
go
polly
but
i
must
he
said
i
hate
to
leave
you
with
that
secretary
harry
please
do
start
again
on
that
you
know
i
do
agree
with
you
and
and
i
do
want
to
quarrel
with
you
when
you
going
away
very
well
he
said
embracing
her
but
do
get
into
any
of
your
scrapes
while
i
am
away
remember
it
a
long
way
to
chicago
and
tipperary
she
laughed
goodbye
darling
boy
and
run
home
the
minute
you
can
i
will
goodbye
pauline
had
turned
dejectedly
back
toward
the
house
when
the
sound
of
steps
on
the
walk
drew
her
attention
it
was
the
postman
i
take
them
she
said
extending
her
hand
she
ran
over
the
envelopes
swiftly
until
she
came
to
one
which
bore
the
corner
mark
of
a
publishing
concern
in
philadelphia
she
had
never
heard
of
the
firm
of
carson
brown
but
to
her
enthusiasm
of
young
authorship
the
very
name
publisher
was
magical
she
opened
the
letter
hastily
and
read
for
a
moment
she
stood
spellbound
with
happiness
the
realization
of
her
dreams
was
at
hand
publishers
were
calling
for
her
work
instead
of
sending
it
back
when
she
sent
it
to
them
with
a
glad
cry
and
waving
the
treasured
letter
she
rushed
out
into
the
garden
to
owen
it
happened
she
sang
gaily
i
am
discovered
you
are
what
miss
pauline
do
you
understand
ca
you
see
not
exactly
while
you
slant
that
letter
above
your
head
like
a
reprieve
for
a
doomed
man
well
read
it
she
leaned
breathlessly
over
his
shoulder
as
he
read
the
familiar
lines
miss
pauline
it
is
splendid
he
exclaimed
i
was
always
sure
you
would
be
successful
with
your
writing
yes
you
encouraged
me
to
get
new
experiences
while
harry
always
opposed
me
she
said
but
oh
i
wish
harry
was
here
to
see
this
shall
you
go
to
philadelphia
inquired
owen
indeed
shall
and
instantly
is
it
so
urgent
as
that
of
course
they
might
change
their
minds
any
moment
and
get
some
one
else
to
write
the
story
will
you
see
what
train
i
can
take
this
evening
owen
while
i
run
and
pack
a
few
things
with
pleasure
but
do
you
think
some
one
ought
to
accompany
you
to
philadelphia
nonsense
it
just
like
crossing
the
street
please
owen
do
you
begin
to
worry
about
every
little
thing
i
do
very
well
he
laughed
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
he
selected
a
time
table
and
scanned
the
train
list
then
he
took
up
the
telephone
and
called
a
number
hello
wrentz
this
is
owen
it
worked
be
at
the
pennsylvania
station
with
your
men
tonight
and
wrentz
if
the
plan
i
gave
you
fails
i
leave
it
to
you
to
invent
a
new
one
you
understand
what
no
i
do
want
any
return
this
time
before
owen
had
helped
pauline
into
her
car
and
bidden
her
goodbye
wrentz
and
his
men
were
on
watch
in
the
railroad
station
goodbye
and
good
luck
pauline
was
standing
in
the
aisle
the
porter
stowing
her
baggage
into
her
drawing
room
when
the
men
entered
the
car
she
noted
them
with
curiosity
there
was
nothing
very
sinister
about
them
but
they
seemed
obviously
out
of
place
but
the
next
moment
she
had
forgotten
about
them
and
for
the
twentieth
time
was
reading
her
own
story
in
the
cosmopolitan
for
now
in
the
light
of
the
magic
it
had
wrought
she
was
bent
on
studying
every
word
to
absorb
the
power
of
her
own
genius
so
to
speak
in
order
that
her
publishers
should
not
be
disappointed
in
the
forthcoming
novel
when
pauline
got
off
the
train
at
philadelphia
she
did
not
notice
that
one
of
the
four
men
who
had
aroused
her
curiosity
walked
behind
her
as
she
left
or
that
he
was
joined
by
the
three
others
in
the
taxicab
which
followed
hers
when
she
left
the
cab
at
one
of
the
fashionable
hotels
wrentz
alone
followed
her
he
was
at
pauline
elbow
when
she
registered
as
she
followed
the
bell
boy
through
the
lobby
he
stepped
to
the
desk
and
noting
the
number
of
pauline
room
no
he
signed
his
name
under
hers
with
a
flourish
by
the
way
he
said
easily
to
the
clerk
is
that
pet
room
of
mine
vacant
the
one
i
had
last
year
the
clerk
smiled
i
see
he
said
i
had
forgotten
it
was
your
pet
room
i
ca
remember
everybody
oh
i
was
just
here
for
a
few
days
said
wrentz
i
remember
you
yes
sir
is
yours
said
the
clerk
front
wrentz
stood
at
the
cigar
counter
to
make
a
purchase
he
did
not
wish
to
follow
pauline
so
closely
that
she
might
know
he
had
taken
the
room
next
to
hers
in
spite
of
her
excitement
pauline
slept
soundly
that
night
the
next
morning
she
had
breakfast
in
her
own
room
and
at
ten
was
ready
to
go
to
carson
brown
she
was
considerably
provoked
by
the
ignorance
of
the
hotel
clerk
who
not
only
did
not
know
the
publishing
house
of
carson
brown
but
could
not
even
direct
her
to
weston
place
he
called
the
head
porter
and
taxicab
manager
the
latter
had
an
idea
i
do
think
it
weston
place
but
there
a
weston
street
down
in
well
it
not
a
very
good
section
of
the
city
miss
i
want
to
never
mind
in
new
york
some
of
our
best
publishing
houses
are
perfect
barns
you
may
call
a
taxicab
yes
miss
publishing
house
in
weston
but
she
does
look
crazy
he
instructed
one
of
his
chauffeurs
i
do
know
what
the
game
is
but
it
a
good
job
pauline
spirits
revived
as
the
cab
whisked
her
through
the
big
business
streets
newly
with
their
morning
life
she
had
a
sense
of
pity
for
the
workers
hastening
to
their
uninspiring
toil
how
few
of
them
had
ever
received
even
a
letter
from
a
publisher
how
few
had
known
the
thrill
of
successful
authorship
a
few
moments
after
pauline
departure
louis
wrentz
and
his
companions
set
to
work
two
of
the
men
left
the
room
and
sauntered
to
opposite
ends
of
the
hall
where
they
lingered
on
watch
wrentz
and
the
other
man
stepped
out
briskly
and
each
with
a
screwdriver
in
his
hand
began
unfastening
the
over
the
doors
of
rooms
and
a
low
cough
sounded
down
the
corridor
and
they
quickly
desisted
from
their
task
and
retired
to
their
room
while
a
maid
passed
by
in
a
moment
they
were
out
again
wrentz
passed
the
number
plate
of
to
his
assistant
who
handed
back
the
plate
of
the
numbers
were
refastened
on
the
wrong
doors
the
watchers
were
called
back
now
said
wrentz
it
is
only
a
matter
of
waiting
pauline
cab
passed
out
of
the
central
city
into
the
region
of
factories
this
looks
like
the
section
where
the
print
shops
are
in
new
york
she
said
confidently
to
herself
but
the
driver
kept
on
into
streets
of
dingy
ancient
houses
streets
crowded
with
unkempt
children
and
lined
with
are
you
sure
you
got
the
right
address
of
them
publishers
miss
he
asked
after
awhile
the
next
street
is
weston
and
it
do
look
very
promisin
she
drew
the
letter
from
her
handbag
and
showed
it
to
him
well
that
the
queerest
thing
i
know
he
said
astonished
by
the
letterhead
i
been
drivin
cabs
horse
and
taxi
for
twenty
years
and
i
never
heard
of
no
such
people
or
no
such
place
well
at
least
go
around
the
corner
and
see
perhaps
it
is
a
new
firm
that
is
listed
as
yet
said
pauline
the
driver
swung
the
cab
into
a
street
even
more
bleak
and
bedraggled
than
the
one
they
had
just
traversed
he
stopped
and
got
out
pauline
followed
him
a
man
slouching
on
a
stoop
looked
up
in
faint
curiosity
as
she
addressed
him
there
ai
no
no
weston
street
he
answered
it
usta
be
over
there
but
it
burnt
down
pauline
face
fell
well
this
is
certainly
stupid
she
exclaimed
of
course
it
is
weston
street
it
weston
place
as
the
letter
says
but
my
guide
ai
got
no
such
place
in
it
miss
answered
the
chauffeur
well
i
go
back
to
the
hotel
she
said
dejectedly
she
was
on
the
verge
of
tears
as
she
left
the
elevator
and
started
for
her
room
she
had
looked
through
all
the
directories
and
street
guides
and
knew
at
last
that
she
had
been
the
victim
of
a
cruel
hoax
all
her
joy
and
pride
of
yesterday
had
turned
to
humiliation
and
grief
she
wanted
to
be
alone
and
have
a
good
cry
she
was
puzzled
for
a
moment
as
she
drew
her
key
from
her
handbag
and
glanced
at
the
numbers
on
the
doors
she
had
been
almost
sure
that
no
was
the
door
but
she
had
been
in
such
excitement
that
she
could
not
trust
any
of
her
impressions
she
started
to
place
the
key
in
the
lock
of
the
door
like
a
flash
it
opened
inward
and
two
pairs
of
hands
gripped
her
her
cry
was
stifled
by
a
hand
over
her
mouth
she
was
dragged
into
the
room
chapter
xxiv
the
mummy
last
warning
pauline
had
barely
time
to
recognize
in
her
new
captors
the
four
strange
men
who
had
attracted
her
attention
on
the
train
before
a
bandage
was
drawn
over
her
eyes
another
over
her
mouth
and
cruel
heavy
hands
began
to
bind
her
limbs
as
she
listened
to
the
rough
voices
of
the
men
the
mystery
of
the
carson
brown
letter
was
entirely
cleared
away
that
was
easy
commented
wrentz
easier
than
the
rest
of
the
work
will
be
said
one
shall
we
leave
her
on
the
floor
boss
asked
another
yes
of
course
then
i
put
a
pillow
under
her
head
pillow
why
a
pillow
since
when
did
you
become
rocco
rocco
scowled
but
he
made
no
reply
you
do
need
any
pillows
or
pullman
cars
on
the
way
to
heaven
said
wrentz
with
a
snarling
laugh
the
laugh
was
checked
abruptly
by
a
rap
on
the
door
for
an
instant
the
ruffians
looked
at
each
other
in
alarm
there
was
no
telling
whether
to
open
that
door
would
be
to
face
the
drawn
revolvers
of
detectives
or
only
the
expectant
eyes
of
a
bellboy
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
answer
however
wrentz
moved
to
the
door
who
is
it
he
asked
your
trunk
sir
you
are
the
porter
yes
sir
well
you
can
leave
the
trunk
at
the
door
i
am
too
busy
to
be
interrupted
just
now
but
here
wrentz
opened
the
door
an
inch
and
passed
a
dollar
bill
to
the
porter
i
am
going
to
need
you
again
in
a
few
hours
he
said
yes
sir
thank
you
sir
move
the
girl
over
behind
the
bed
out
of
range
there
commanded
wrentz
two
men
seized
pauline
and
dragged
her
across
the
room
where
she
could
not
be
seen
through
the
door
which
wrentz
now
opened
wide
in
the
corridor
outside
stood
a
large
trunk
wrentz
and
one
of
the
men
lifted
it
and
carried
it
into
the
room
your
baggage
is
light
said
the
man
it
will
be
heavier
in
a
little
while
open
it
they
obeyed
do
you
think
it
is
large
enough
asked
wrentz
large
enough
for
what
the
girl
demanded
rocco
who
had
been
sulking
since
his
rebuke
you
are
shrewd
rocco
you
have
guessed
rightly
i
suppose
you
want
to
put
a
pillow
in
it
yes
i
would
said
rocco
who
was
the
youngest
of
the
band
or
else
i
would
kill
her
first
what
is
the
use
of
torture
wrentz
dark
fact
grew
even
blacker
as
he
eyed
the
young
man
if
you
were
a
grown
man
rocco
he
said
instead
of
a
boy
you
would
know
that
there
is
one
form
of
murder
that
is
always
found
out
the
trunk
murder
and
i
want
to
say
this
to
you
he
added
with
growing
heat
that
if
i
hear
one
more
word
of
rebellion
from
you
this
prisoner
will
be
alive
some
hours
after
you
have
departed
now
then
into
the
trunk
with
her
rocco
sullenly
helped
the
others
in
the
grim
task
the
trunk
large
as
it
was
was
not
deep
enough
to
permit
pauline
a
sitting
posture
nor
long
enough
to
prevent
the
painful
cramping
of
her
limbs
but
she
was
deadened
to
physical
pain
with
the
words
of
her
doom
still
ringing
in
her
ears
the
calm
discussion
of
her
death
her
terror
was
her
torture
the
choking
gag
the
cutting
bonds
the
stifling
trunk
in
which
the
knife
of
wrentz
had
cut
but
a
few
air
holes
these
were
as
nothing
to
the
agony
of
her
spirit
the
agony
of
a
lingering
journey
toward
a
certain
but
mysterious
end
pauline
had
been
a
prisoner
before
had
been
through
many
and
desperate
dangers
but
her
heart
had
never
failed
her
utterly
until
she
felt
the
pressure
of
the
trunk
lid
on
her
bent
shoulders
and
heard
the
clamping
of
the
locks
that
bound
her
in
she
could
still
hear
the
voices
i
go
down
and
settle
my
bill
and
send
up
that
porter
wrentz
was
saying
do
let
him
help
with
the
trunk
except
to
run
the
elevator
you
sure
your
car
is
at
the
side
entrance
not
out
in
front
yes
i
will
meet
you
there
pauline
had
been
so
carefully
bound
that
she
could
not
stir
in
the
trunk
as
she
felt
it
lifted
and
carried
rapidly
through
the
corridor
to
the
hotel
elevator
she
strained
with
all
her
might
to
make
a
noise
to
beat
with
hands
or
feet
or
even
with
her
head
the
sides
of
the
receptacle
but
it
was
no
use
she
was
carried
through
the
hotel
and
out
to
the
side
entrance
without
attracting
attention
she
felt
the
trunk
lifted
over
the
men
heads
and
the
whirring
of
an
automobile
told
her
that
she
was
being
placed
in
the
machine
well
you
did
care
much
for
your
pet
room
this
time
wrentz
smiled
the
clerk
as
wrentz
asked
for
his
bill
indeed
i
did
but
a
message
has
called
me
back
to
new
york
he
paid
his
bill
and
hurried
out
to
the
big
car
in
the
back
of
which
pauline
trunk
had
been
placed
springing
to
the
wheel
he
ordered
his
followers
in
and
they
drove
away
once
on
suburban
roads
wrentz
either
fearful
of
pursuit
or
drunk
with
success
began
speeding
along
the
railroad
tracks
the
noise
of
their
speed
drew
a
tumult
of
wild
sounds
from
a
string
of
gaily
painted
cars
on
the
siding
the
snarls
and
howls
of
beasts
were
mingled
with
the
angry
cries
of
men
who
seemed
to
be
at
work
on
the
other
side
of
the
cars
to
pauline
the
noises
came
faintly
but
with
a
horrid
and
unearthly
note
she
who
had
been
the
victim
of
so
many
cruet
and
fantastic
plots
knew
not
what
new
danger
the
roaring
of
the
beasts
threatened
in
a
moment
though
her
mind
was
set
at
rest
on
this
point
for
rocco
the
young
bandit
turning
to
the
man
next
him
asked
what
does
it
mean
what
are
they
doing
it
is
a
circus
train
answered
the
man
they
are
loading
the
beasts
into
the
cars
pauline
felt
the
machine
swerve
sharply
and
evidently
take
to
a
for
she
could
hear
the
swish
of
leaves
on
overhanging
branches
as
they
brushed
through
this
place
will
do
she
heard
wrentz
say
now
be
quick
about
it
it
has
come
breathed
pauline
to
herself
this
is
the
place
where
i
am
to
die
through
her
mind
in
piteous
pageant
flashed
thoughts
of
home
of
harry
of
even
raymond
owen
there
was
a
great
loneliness
in
the
hour
of
doom
but
it
would
be
over
quickly
she
shut
her
eyes
tight
and
clenched
her
tied
hands
as
the
trunk
was
taken
from
the
machine
and
placed
upon
the
ground
open
it
commanded
wrentz
i
do
want
her
to
die
in
there
the
men
quickly
unclamped
the
locks
and
lifted
pauline
out
take
off
the
ropes
and
the
bandages
ordered
wrentz
take
them
off
why
she
scream
exclaimed
one
if
she
does
you
may
choke
her
to
death
in
the
car
replied
wrentz
why
not
here
asked
the
oldest
of
the
men
did
hush
your
mouth
you
confounded
rascal
wrentz
screamed
are
you
going
to
mention
that
name
here
what
harm
as
long
as
she
is
to
die
dead
women
tell
no
more
tales
than
dead
men
i
will
name
all
names
that
are
to
be
spoken
declared
wrentz
well
he
of
the
name
that
is
unspoken
at
least
he
did
say
that
we
must
have
no
delays
we
want
to
earn
our
money
as
well
as
you
louis
remember
that
come
come
he
said
this
is
no
way
to
be
arguing
among
friends
you
get
your
money
all
right
but
there
is
one
thing
to
ai
get
it
except
through
me
so
let
me
handle
the
matter
put
the
girl
in
the
car
pauline
although
her
bonds
had
been
cut
away
was
unable
to
rise
to
her
feet
they
lifted
her
to
her
feet
she
took
a
step
or
two
while
they
watched
her
curiously
quickly
strength
and
came
back
to
her
with
a
sudden
spring
she
struck
at
wrentz
with
her
fist
and
as
he
drew
back
astonished
she
darted
across
the
roadway
toward
the
wood
it
was
but
a
futile
maneuver
she
had
gone
but
a
few
paces
when
she
was
gripped
from
behind
and
snatched
back
you
see
louis
i
told
you
she
would
do
something
of
the
kind
said
the
old
bandit
and
i
told
you
it
would
do
no
harm
place
her
in
the
car
between
you
and
rocco
if
she
screams
or
makes
a
move
to
get
away
you
may
do
as
you
wish
but
not
until
then
pauline
still
struggled
feebly
as
she
was
lifted
into
the
machine
wrentz
kicked
the
empty
trunk
to
the
side
of
the
byroad
and
took
the
wheel
again
he
drove
back
to
the
main
drive
that
skirted
the
railroad
distant
as
they
were
by
now
the
clamor
of
the
caged
beasts
in
the
circus
train
could
still
be
heard
to
pauline
the
creatures
seemed
less
wild
and
cruel
than
these
her
human
captors
wrentz
put
on
even
greater
speed
than
he
had
ventured
before
two
policemen
burgess
and
blount
of
the
motorcycle
squad
were
standing
by
their
wheels
in
the
roadway
when
the
sound
of
the
car
rush
reached
their
ears
from
half
a
mile
away
by
george
that
fellow
coming
some
exclaimed
blount
and
looks
as
if
he
was
going
to
stop
said
the
other
halt
halt
there
he
commanded
as
the
machine
flashed
up
in
a
mantle
of
dust
they
are
coming
louis
said
one
of
the
men
i
know
they
are
but
there
is
no
machine
made
that
can
catch
this
one
have
your
guns
ready
though
in
case
they
begin
to
fire
pick
them
off
pauline
shuddered
at
the
way
in
which
rocco
and
the
man
on
the
other
side
drew
their
heavy
pistols
from
their
hip
pockets
and
rested
them
on
their
knees
do
you
see
the
girl
in
that
car
yelled
burgess
to
his
companion
over
the
din
of
their
streaking
machines
yes
we
want
that
party
for
more
than
speeding
i
guess
answered
blount
they
bent
low
over
their
and
raced
on
if
he
takes
the
curve
like
that
we
got
him
dead
or
alive
said
burgess
and
it
looks
as
if
he
would
by
george
he
is
wrentz
car
had
shot
suddenly
out
of
sight
around
a
twist
in
the
road
wrentz
was
an
able
driver
and
even
at
its
terrific
speed
the
machine
took
the
first
turn
gracefully
but
wrentz
had
not
counted
on
a
second
shorter
turn
to
the
opposite
direction
and
he
worked
the
wheel
madly
for
a
second
swerve
the
huge
car
skidded
spun
round
and
reeling
on
two
wheels
for
an
instant
turned
over
in
the
ditch
it
was
several
moments
before
pauline
opened
her
eyes
she
shut
them
quickly
and
staggered
to
her
feet
shuddering
she
had
been
lying
across
rocco
dead
body
which
had
broken
her
fall
and
saved
her
life
two
other
men
lay
motionless
in
the
road
but
from
under
the
overturned
car
there
came
a
sound
and
pauline
realized
with
quick
alarm
that
wrentz
was
still
alive
she
ran
across
the
road
and
into
the
parked
woods
that
hid
the
railroad
from
the
drive
wrentz
struggled
out
from
beneath
the
car
his
eyes
swept
swiftly
from
the
bodies
of
his
dead
comrades
to
the
form
of
pauline
just
vanishing
in
the
thicket
he
was
bruised
and
bleeding
but
with
the
instinct
of
a
beast
of
prey
he
followed
his
quarry
dead
or
alive
was
right
said
burgess
jumping
from
his
wheel
and
examining
the
bodies
in
the
road
i
wonder
what
that
fellow
was
up
to
and
where
is
the
girl
i
saw
her
and
one
of
the
men
make
into
the
park
there
said
blount
you
take
charge
here
and
i
go
after
them
as
he
moved
into
the
thicket
in
the
direction
pauline
had
taken
young
blount
attention
was
attracted
by
a
new
commotion
the
park
was
on
the
crest
of
a
steep
cliff
overlooking
the
railroad
tracks
and
from
the
tracks
came
a
riot
of
voices
blount
forced
his
way
through
the
wood
to
a
viewpoint
from
the
cliff
below
him
a
score
of
men
were
moving
rapidly
along
the
tracks
in
wide
open
order
evidently
bent
on
some
sort
of
a
hunt
the
circus
men
said
blount
to
himself
an
animal
must
have
got
out
this
is
certainly
some
day
for
business
he
turned
back
to
the
work
in
hand
pauline
spurred
by
terror
as
she
realized
that
wrentz
was
again
upon
her
trail
had
sped
like
a
wild
thing
through
the
park
paths
she
could
hear
the
heavy
footsteps
of
her
pursuer
close
behind
she
could
hear
also
a
shouting
from
afar
off
she
made
toward
the
shouting
the
sound
of
any
voice
but
the
voices
of
the
inhuman
men
who
had
planned
her
death
was
welcome
to
her
ears
she
came
out
upon
the
cliff
where
it
sloped
steeply
to
the
railroad
yards
but
not
too
steeply
to
prevent
her
descending
from
her
position
the
lines
of
freight
cars
cut
off
from
her
vision
the
strange
group
of
hunters
who
were
shouting
running
stumbling
creeping
clutching
at
small
bushes
she
scrambled
down
the
cliff
stop
and
come
back
she
heard
a
menacing
voice
behind
her
she
sped
on
the
faster
a
line
of
high
bushes
fringed
the
bottom
of
the
cliff
between
the
bushes
and
the
first
rails
ran
a
ditch
sheltered
from
all
view
from
above
pauline
dragged
herself
along
this
ditch
seeking
a
hiding
place
she
knew
her
strength
was
almost
gone
she
was
in
terror
of
fainting
if
she
could
hide
somewhere
and
rest
a
single
empty
freight
car
stood
on
the
outer
track
a
hundred
yards
away
its
open
door
offered
the
only
means
of
concealment
that
she
had
she
believed
that
the
bushes
were
high
enough
still
to
shield
her
while
she
climbed
into
the
car
in
this
she
was
wrong
wrentz
watching
from
above
for
he
was
afraid
of
the
voices
on
the
tracks
below
and
had
not
followed
pauline
watched
with
pleasure
as
she
crawled
to
the
side
of
the
car
and
after
two
failures
managed
to
drag
herself
through
the
high
door
she
sank
exhausted
gradually
however
her
strength
returned
her
mind
recovered
from
the
dazing
experiences
of
the
last
few
hours
she
began
to
gain
courage
and
to
plan
her
further
flight
as
she
moved
toward
the
car
door
to
reconnoiter
the
sense
of
an
invisible
presence
suddenly
possessed
her
instinctively
she
turned
one
glance
behind
her
and
every
fiber
of
her
body
seemed
to
turn
to
stone
fear
she
had
known
but
never
terror
such
as
this
she
stood
paralyzed
unable
to
close
her
eyes
unable
to
move
for
there
beside
her
towering
above
her
in
horrible
strength
with
wildly
grinning
face
and
cruelly
outreaching
claws
stood
the
thing
that
gave
explanation
to
the
hunt
outside
and
the
shouting
pauline
was
in
the
clutches
of
a
gorilla
she
fainted
as
she
felt
herself
gripped
in
the
hairy
arms
wrentz
was
gloating
as
he
stood
on
watch
over
pauline
hiding
place
in
a
little
while
the
men
would
be
out
of
the
railroad
yard
and
he
would
go
down
and
finish
the
work
but
his
rejoicings
were
turned
into
amazement
by
the
sight
which
now
presented
itself
at
the
door
of
the
car
with
pauline
carried
over
one
arm
as
if
she
had
been
a
wisp
of
straw
the
gorilla
was
crawling
down
to
the
trackside
wrentz
saw
it
crawl
along
the
ditch
and
heard
the
crunch
of
broken
bushes
as
the
huge
creature
clambered
up
the
cliff
wondering
scarcely
able
to
believe
his
eyes
wrentz
followed
at
a
safe
distance
young
policeman
blount
searching
for
the
fugitive
chauffeur
of
the
wrecked
automobile
and
the
mysterious
young
woman
who
had
escaped
from
it
paused
at
the
sound
of
heavy
a
low
guttural
snarling
sound
a
sound
hardly
human
accompanied
the
footsteps
he
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
cliff
a
half
mile
from
where
pauline
had
found
her
perilous
shelter
peering
up
through
the
bushes
his
astonishment
and
horror
were
a
match
for
the
astonishment
and
joy
of
wrentz
the
gorilla
with
pauline
still
clutched
in
the
mighty
paw
had
reached
almost
the
top
of
the
cliff
at
its
steepest
point
blount
blew
his
whistle
blast
after
blast
he
started
up
the
cliff
but
came
back
at
the
sound
of
hurrying
footsteps
and
calls
the
hunters
from
the
railroad
yards
had
heard
the
signal
hello
have
you
seen
anything
of
the
gorilla
yelled
the
first
man
to
come
up
blount
pointed
up
the
cliff
side
to
where
the
hideous
beast
was
just
dragging
pauline
over
the
topmost
ledge
the
men
stood
with
pity
a
girl
gasped
one
of
them
she
as
good
as
dead
if
she
dead
now
he
just
killed
our
foreman
back
in
the
yards
no
thank
heaven
cried
blount
she
not
dead
look
at
the
top
of
the
cliff
they
saw
pauline
form
suddenly
quicken
into
life
the
gorilla
had
released
its
hold
upon
her
to
make
sure
of
its
footing
on
the
perilous
ledge
now
she
stood
a
frail
pitiful
hopeless
thing
fighting
actually
assailing
the
beast
more
mighty
than
a
dozen
men
their
hearts
sick
within
them
they
watched
the
brief
struggle
wrentz
too
watched
it
from
his
hiding
place
on
the
top
of
the
cliff
but
his
heart
was
not
sick
in
a
moment
he
was
sure
his
work
would
be
accomplished
for
him
and
his
employer
would
be
rid
of
pauline
marvin
in
a
way
that
could
reflect
no
blame
on
any
one
blount
started
up
the
cliff
he
took
it
for
granted
that
the
others
would
follow
but
looking
down
after
gaining
half
the
distance
he
saw
the
circus
men
still
huddled
together
in
fascinated
awe
look
look
they
called
to
him
he
taking
her
up
the
tree
blount
looked
and
saw
the
gorilla
climbing
ponderously
the
trunk
of
a
large
tree
the
branches
of
which
overhung
the
precipice
blount
climbed
on
frantically
he
stopped
again
the
gorilla
was
crawling
out
upon
one
of
the
overhanging
branches
the
strange
had
conceived
a
death
for
pauline
more
terrible
than
any
raymond
owen
bad
ever
plotted
wrentz
himself
might
have
envied
the
gorilla
blount
drew
his
revolver
he
was
not
more
than
a
hundred
feet
below
them
now
it
the
chance
of
hitting
her
against
the
chance
of
saving
her
he
muttered
he
fired
with
a
snarl
of
pain
the
gorilla
turned
and
bit
savagely
at
its
shoulder
blount
rushed
on
he
stopped
again
and
fired
he
was
at
the
verge
of
the
cliff
he
could
blaze
away
now
with
no
danger
of
hitting
pauline
for
he
was
a
sure
marksman
with
a
great
throb
of
joy
in
his
heart
the
gallant
young
fellow
saw
the
beast
turn
and
leaving
pauline
with
her
arms
around
the
limb
her
eyes
shut
against
the
dizzy
depths
below
move
back
and
scramble
down
blount
was
on
the
as
the
gorilla
reached
the
ground
the
beast
charged
blount
fired
again
again
the
gorilla
snarling
bit
at
its
wounded
side
but
it
came
an
as
if
a
dozen
lives
vitalized
the
gross
body
blount
backed
away
from
the
cliff
but
the
monster
was
upon
him
it
clutched
him
hurled
him
to
ground
dragged
him
back
to
the
dizzy
verge
slowly
blount
was
pressed
over
the
precipice
the
watchers
below
saw
him
in
his
last
struggle
writhe
in
the
deathly
grasp
twist
his
revolver
and
fire
three
shots
into
the
heart
of
the
gorilla
down
the
long
fall
to
the
jagged
rocks
went
the
beast
pauline
was
bending
over
the
bleeding
battered
form
of
the
young
officer
when
the
circus
crew
reached
them
oh
you
are
brave
brave
she
cried
he
opened
his
eyes
and
grinned
merrily
if
i
brave
i
like
to
know
what
you
are
oh
i
not
brave
i
nothing
but
a
selfish
little
pig
cried
pauline
i
treated
the
dearest
fellow
in
the
world
shamefully
he
forgiven
me
over
and
over
but
he
wo
forgive
me
this
time
he
forgive
you
anything
mim
blount
assured
her
for
the
sake
of
getting
you
safe
back
but
i
should
like
to
be
the
man
who
got
you
into
this
when
he
hears
of
it
the
man
safe
enough
said
burgess
who
had
just
up
in
time
to
hear
blount
last
words
no
he
did
escape
that
way
as
blount
uttered
an
ejaculation
of
disgust
he
ran
full
tilt
into
me
and
when
i
tried
to
arrest
him
he
drew
his
revolver
on
me
by
good
luck
i
got
him
first
yes
jo
dead
dead
repeated
pauline
in
a
low
tone
how
horrible
to
go
out
of
life
a
moment
after
you
had
tried
to
commit
murder
it
not
his
first
burgess
said
coolly

after
him
and
his
gang

six
months

a
haul
of
papers

somebody
into
trouble

the
young
one
cried
pauline
he
tried
to
help
me
rocco

dead
when
they
picked
him
up
and
now
miss
marvin
had
i

with
irrepressible
curiosity
how
did
you

burgess
smiled
how

pardon

to
face
but

blount

all
the
luck

a
himself
tomorrow
the
hot
color
rushed
over
pauline
face
a
so
that
was
what
she
meant
to
the
public
to
the
man
on
the
street
please
please
do
let
this
get
into
the
papers
she
begged
i

anything
in
the
world
for
you
if
you
just
keep
it
out
of
the
papers
will
you
tell
us
about
those
other
adventures
burgess
asked
eagerly
it
a
sure
thing
that
somebody
been
pulling
the
wires
making
you
walk
the
tight
rope
and
somebody
that
knows
everything
you
do
any
man
on
the
force
who
could
spot
him
would
be
made
no
no
pauline
insisted
an
uneasy
remembrance
of
harry
suspicions
lending
emphasis
to
her
denial
some
of
those
things
were
done
before
anybody
out
of
the
house
could
know
just
as
i
said
burgess
agreed
triumphantly
it
somebody
in
the
house
why
he
knew
about
your
bull
terrier
and
the
papers
had
it
had
just
been
given
you
the
day
before
darned
clever
little
dog
to
give
your
folks
the
clue
cyrus
pauline
face
broke
into
smiles
and
dimples
he
the
cleverest
dearest
most
beautiful
dog
in
the
world
fine
dog
yes
miss
if
he
like
the
picture
the
reporters
got
pauline
face
clouded
for
the
moment
she
had
forgotten
the
horrors
of
publicity
you
wo
put
this
in
the
papers
she
pleaded
he
sha
blount
raised
himself
weakly
on
his
elbow
if
the
reporters
have
got
it
already
we
keep
you
out
of
it
anyhow
miss
keep
a
scoop
like
this
out
of
the
papers
burgess
laughed
aloud
you
talking
through
your
hat
blount
it
ca
be
done
in
one
terrible
flash
pauline
saw
her
name
in
capitals
her
photograph
almost
photographs
of
her
trunk
the
gorilla
blount
in
too
and
harry
furious
too
far
away
for
moral
suasion
stern
cold
unforgiving
worse
still
disgusted
she
realized
as
she
had
never
realized
before
that
harry
was
what
counted
most
harry
was
the
one
thing
she
could
not
live
without
to
the
terrors
of
these
hours
was
added
the
terror
of
losing
him
she
burst
into
wild
sobs
i
want
harry
i
do
want
anything
in
the
world
but
harry
oh
take
me
home
please
take
me
home
burgess
got
a
taxi
and
went
with
her
to
the
hotel
where
she
was
put
to
bed
a
doctor
sent
for
and
where
at
last
she
fell
asleep
but
it
was
not
until
noon
the
next
day
that
she
was
able
to
take
the
train
for
new
york
and
then
began
two
hours
and
a
half
that
pauline
remembered
to
the
last
hour
of
her
life
her
photograph
stared
at
her
from
the
front
page
of
every
daily
paper
even
the
glasses
and
thick
veil
she
wore
to
conceal
her
identity
could
not
soften
the
conspicuous
pictures
newsboys
called
her
name
and
the
gorilla
story
wrentz
and
blount
names
together
every
passenger
in
the
car
it
seemed
to
her
men
women
and
children
were
discussing
her
there
were
silly
jokes
contemptuous
criticism
suggestions
that
there
was
something
queer
about
miss
marvin
just
behind
her
she
heard
one
woman
say
to
another
but
then
my
dear
what
could
you
expect
of
any
girl
whose
mother
was
an
egyptian
as
if
this
equaled
breaking
the
whole
decalogue
though
she
had
wired
owen
the
motor
did
not
meet
her
and
feeling
more
than
ever
forlorn
and
forsaken
pauline
got
into
a
taxi
never
had
the
old
place
looked
so
beautiful
as
today
when
she
felt
that
it
could
never
be
her
home
again
she
must
tell
harry
that
her
mother
was
an
egyptian
and
then
even
if
he
could
forgive
her
this
last
adventure
he
would
never
marry
her
oh
how
could
she
have
been
so
silly
so
conceited
so
cruel
to
harry
and
what
a
fool
she
had
been
to
go
in
search
of
experience
in
order
to
write
if
she
could
write
with
all
this
beauty
spread
out
before
her
if
she
could
write
by
living
a
real
human
everyday
life
the
sort
of
life
that
brings
you
close
to
normal
people
how
could
she
ever
hope
to
write
by
living
on
excitement
on
abnormal
excitement
and
with
abnormal
people
and
situations
she
paid
the
driver
and
was
walking
slowly
up
the
steps
of
the
veranda
when
suddenly
she
halted
as
if
she
had
been
struck
what
was
that
it
could
be
yes
it
was
funeral
streamers
hanging
from
the
with
a
scream
that
rang
through
the
closed
door
pauline
fainted
when
she
recovered
consciousness
she
was
in
the
library
bemis
and
margaret
were
bending
over
her
and
strong
tender
arms
were
around
her
harry
she
murmured
instinctively
do
try
to
talk
my
darling
drink
this
you
go
to
bemis
and
margaret
oh
harry
i
thought
you
were
dead
i
very
much
alive
harry
said
with
a
tremulous
laugh
but
harry
what
does
all
that
black
on
the
door
mean
it
means
said
harry
savagely
that
though
the
mills
of
the
gods
grind
slowly
they
grind
surely
owen
dead
owen
her
eyes
large
with
terror
blount
words
ringing
in
her
ears
i
should
like
to
be
the
man
at
the
bottom
of
this
when
marvin
hears
of
it
she
repeated
in
a
breathless
whisper
harry
you
did
kill
him
he
did
give
me
the
chance
he
was
dead
when
i
got
here
overdose
of
morphine
stevens
said
seems
he
was
a
drug
fiend
why
that
was
the
reason
pauline
said
her
filling
with
tears
he
was
crazy
he
did
know
what
he
was
doing
poor
owen
poor
owen
then
turned
hastily
to
safer
topics
but
i
thought
you
went
to
chicago
for
a
week
i
did
but
you
laugh
pauline
i
know
it
sounds
fool
the
mummy
came
to
me
just
as
she
came
to
me
in
montana
i
took
the
first
train
home
i
knew
you
were
in
danger
i
knew
it
was
a
warning
i
ever
trust
you
out
of
my
sight
again
you
got
to
marry
me
now
pauline
shrank
back
from
his
kisses
no
no
harry
i
ca
i
there
was
a
woman
on
the
train
said
my
mother
was
an
egyptian
harry
broke
into
a
peal
of
laughter
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
is
that
the
only
reason
you
wo
harry
is
it
true
i
do
know
and
i
do
care
what
difference
does
it
make
who
your
mother

i
care
for
his
voice
shook
i
love
you
so
pauline
that

pauline
silenced
him
with
a
kiss
i
all
through
with
adventures

to
marry
me

a
selfish
silly
conceited
little
pig
but
i

i
cured
at
last
as
he
clasped
her
in
his
arms
the
shutter
swung
violently
to
and
the
case
containing
the
mummy
fell
with
a
clatter
to
the
floor
harry
ran
and
lifted
it
as
tenderly
as
if
it
had
been
a
little
child
i
suppose
we
can
hardly
keep
her
here
he
said
regretfully
but
we
give
no
i
ca

her
up
entirely
we
lend
her
to
the
metropolitan
art
museum
where

faithful
friend

here
another
exclaimed
pauline
as
cyrus
ran
frantically
into
the
room
and
leaping
upon
the
couch
with
ecstatic
barks
of
welcome
threatened
again
to
take
the
place
that
belonged
by
right
to
harry
but
this
time
harry
joined
in
pauline
caresses
the
end
