introduction
born
irreverent
scrawled
mark
twain
on
a
scratch
pad
like
all
other
people
i
have
ever
known
or
heard
of
i
am
hoping
to
remain
so
while
there
are
any
reverent
irreverences
left
to
make
fun
holograph
manuscript
of
samuel
clemens
in
the
collection
of
the
meine
mark
twain
was
just
as
irreverent
as
he
dared
be
and
reveals
his
richest
expression
of
sovereign
contempt
for
overstuffed
language
genteel
literature
and
conventional
idiocies
later
when
a
magazine
editor
apostrophized
o
that
we
had
a
rabelais
mark
impishly
and
anonymously
submitted
and
that
same
editor
a
praiser
of
rabelais
scathingly
abused
it
and
the
sender
in
this
episode
as
in
many
others
mark
twain
the
bad
boy
of
american
literature
revealed
his
huge
delight
in
blasting
the
shams
of
contemporary
hypocrisy
too
there
was
always
the
spirit
of
tom
sawyer
deviltry
in
mark
that
prompted
him
as
he
himself
boasted
to
see
how
much
holy
indignation
he
could
stir
up
in
the
world
who
wrote
the
correct
and
complete
title
of
as
first
issued
was
date
as
it
was
by
the
social
fireside
in
the
time
of
the
tudors
for
many
years
after
its
anonymous
first
issue
in
its
authorship
was
variously
conjectured
and
widely
disputed
in
boston
william
ball
one
of
the
leading
theatrical
critics
during
the
late
asserted
that
it
was
originally
written
by
an
english
actor
name
not
divulged
who
gave
it
to
him
ball
original
it
was
said
looked
like
a
newspaper
strip
in
the
way
it
was
printed
and
may
indeed
have
been
a
proof
pulled
in
some
newspaper
office
in
louis
william
marion
reedy
editor
of
the
louis
mirror
had
seen
this
famous
tour
de
force
circulated
in
the
early
in
form
he
first
learned
from
eugene
field
that
it
was
from
the
pen
of
mark
twain
many
people
said
reedy
thought
the
thing
was
done
by
field
and
attributed
as
a
joke
to
mark
twain
field
had
a
perfect
genius
for
that
sort
of
thing
as
many
extant
specimens
attest
and
for
that
sort
of
practical
joke
but
to
my
thinking
the
humor
of
the
piece
is
too
mellow
not
hard
and
bright
and
bitter
to
be
eugene
opinion
hits
off
the
fundamental
difference
between
these
two
great
humorists
one
half
suspects
that
reedy
was
thinking
of
field
french
crisis
but
twain
first
claimed
his
bantling
from
the
fog
of
anonymity
in
in
a
letter
addressed
to
charles
orr
librarian
of
case
library
cleveland
said
clemens
in
the
course
of
his
letter
dated
july
from
dublin
new
hampshire
the
title
of
the
piece
is
the
piece
is
a
supposititious
conversation
which
takes
place
in
queen
elizabeth
closet
in
that
year
between
the
queen
ben
jonson
beaumont
sir
walter
raleigh
the
duchess
of
bilgewater
and
one
or
two
others
and
is
not
as
john
hay
mistakenly
supposes
a
serious
effort
to
bring
back
our
literature
and
philosophy
to
the
sober
and
chaste
elizabeth
time
if
there
is
a
decent
word
findable
in
it
it
is
because
i
overlooked
it
i
hasten
to
assure
you
that
it
is
not
printed
in
my
published
twitting
the
rev
joseph
twichell
the
circumstances
of
how
came
to
be
written
have
since
been
officially
revealed
by
albert
bigelow
paine
in
twain
a
bibliography
and
in
the
publication
of
mark
twain
notebook
was
written
during
the
summer
of
when
the
clemens
family
had
retreated
to
quarry
farm
in
elmira
county
new
york
here
clemens
enjoyed
relief
from
social
obligations
the
children
romped
over
the
countryside
and
mark
retired
to
his
octagonal
study
which
perched
high
on
the
hill
looked
out
upon
the
valley
below
it
was
in
the
famous
summer
of
too
that
mark
was
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
tom
sawyer
before
the
close
of
the
same
year
he
had
already
begun
work
on
adventures
of
huckleberry
finn
published
in
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
use
of
the
title
the
duke
of
bilgewater
in
huck
finn
when
the
duchess
of
bilgewater
had
already
made
her
appearance
in
sandwiched
between
his
two
great
masterpieces
tom
sawyer
and
huck
finn
the
writing
of
was
indeed
a
strange
interlude
during
this
prolific
period
mark
wrote
many
minor
items
most
of
them
rejected
by
howells
and
read
extensively
in
one
of
his
favorite
books
pepys
diary
like
many
another
writer
mark
was
captivated
by
style
and
spirit
and
he
determined
says
albert
bigelow
paine
in
his
twain
a
biography
to
try
his
hand
on
an
imaginary
record
of
conversation
and
court
manners
of
a
bygone
day
written
in
the
phrase
of
the
period
the
result
was
conversation
in
the
time
of
queen
elizabeth
or
as
he
later
called
it
the
recorded
by
a
supposed
pepys
of
that
period
was
written
with
all
the
outspoken
coarseness
and
nakedness
of
that
rank
day
when
fireside
sociabilities
were
limited
only
to
the
loosened
fancy
vocabulary
and
physical
performance
and
not
by
any
bounds
of
it
was
written
as
a
letter
continues
paine
to
that
robust
divine
rev
joseph
twichell
who
unlike
howells
had
no
scruples
about
breadth
of
parlance
the
rev
joseph
twichell
mark
most
intimate
friend
for
over
forty
years
was
pastor
of
the
asylum
hill
congregational
church
of
hartford
which
mark
facetiously
called
the
church
of
the
holy
speculators
because
of
its
wealthy
parishioners
here
mark
had
first
met
joe
at
a
social
and
their
meeting
ripened
into
a
glorious
life
long
friendship
twichell
was
a
man
of
about
mark
own
age
a
profound
scholar
a
devout
christian
yet
a
man
with
an
exuberant
sense
of
humor
and
a
profound
understanding
of
the
frailties
of
the
rev
twichell
performed
the
marriage
ceremony
for
mark
twain
and
solemnized
the
births
of
his
children
joe
his
friend
counseled
him
on
literary
as
well
as
personal
matters
for
the
remainder
of
mark
life
it
is
important
to
catch
this
brief
glimpse
of
the
man
for
whom
this
masterpiece
was
written
for
without
it
one
can
not
fully
understand
the
spirit
in
which
was
written
or
the
keen
enjoyment
which
mark
and
joe
derived
from
it
save
me
the
story
of
the
first
issue
of
is
one
of
finesse
state
diplomacy
and
surreptitious
printing
the
rev
joe
twichell
for
whose
delectation
the
piece
had
been
written
apparently
had
pocketed
the
document
for
four
long
years
then
in
it
came
into
the
hands
of
john
hay
later
secretary
of
state
presumably
sent
to
him
by
mark
twain
hay
pronounced
the
sketch
a
masterpiece
and
wrote
immediately
to
his
old
cleveland
friend
alexander
gunn
prince
of
connoisseurs
in
art
and
literature
the
following
correspondence
reveals
the
fine
diplomacy
which
made
the
name
of
john
hay
known
throughout
the
world
department
of
state
washington
june
dear
gunn
are
you
in
cleveland
for
all
this
week
if
you
will
say
yes
by
return
mail
i
have
a
masterpiece
to
submit
to
your
consideration
which
is
only
in
my
hands
for
a
few
days
yours
very
much
worritted
by
the
depravity
of
christendom
hay
the
second
letter
discloses
hay
own
high
opinion
of
the
effort
and
his
deep
concern
for
its
safety
june
my
dear
gunn
here
it
is
it
was
written
by
mark
twain
in
a
serious
effort
to
bring
back
our
literature
and
philosophy
to
the
sober
and
chaste
elizabethan
standard
but
the
taste
of
the
present
day
is
too
corrupt
for
anything
so
classic
he
has
not
yet
been
able
even
to
find
a
publisher
the
globe
has
not
yet
recovered
from
downey
inroad
and
they
wo
touch
it
i
send
it
to
you
as
one
of
the
few
lingering
relics
of
that
race
of
appreciative
critics
who
know
a
good
thing
when
they
see
it
read
it
with
reverence
and
gratitude
and
send
it
back
to
me
for
mark
is
impatient
to
see
once
more
his
wandering
offspring
yours
hay
in
his
third
letter
one
can
almost
hear
hay
chuckle
in
the
certainty
that
his
diplomatic
if
somewhat
wicked
suggestion
would
bear
fruit
washington
my
dear
gunn
i
have
your
letter
and
the
proposition
which
you
make
to
pull
a
few
proofs
of
the
masterpiece
is
highly
attractive
and
of
course
highly
immoral
i
can
not
properly
consent
to
it
and
i
am
afraid
the
great
many
would
think
i
was
taking
an
unfair
advantage
of
his
confidence
please
send
back
the
document
as
soon
as
you
can
and
if
in
spite
of
my
prohibition
you
take
these
proofs
save
me

very
truly

thus
was
this
elizabethan
dialogue
poured
into
the
moulds
of
cold
type
according
to
merle
johnson
mark
twain
bibliographer
it
was
issued
in
pamphlet
form
without
wrappers
or
covers
there
were
pages
of
text
and
the
pamphlet
measured
by
inches
only
four
copies
are
believed
to
have
been
printed
one
for
hay
one
for
gunn
and
two
for
twain
in
the
matter
of
humor
wrote
clemens
referring
to
hay
delicious
notes
what
an
unsurpassable
touch
john
hay
had
humor
at
west
point
the
first
printing
of
in
actual
book
form
was
donne
at
ye
academie
press
in
west
point
new
york
under
the
supervision
of
lieut
wood
then
adjutant
of
the
military
academy
in
mark
twain
and
joe
twichell
visited
their
friend
lieut
wood
at
west
point
where
they
learned
that
wood
as
adjutant
had
under
his
control
a
small
printing
establishment
on
mark
return
to
hartford
wood
received
a
letter
asking
if
he
would
do
mark
a
great
favor
by
printing
something
he
had
written
which
he
did
not
care
to
entrust
to
the
ordinary
printer
wood
replied
that
he
would
be
glad
to
oblige
on
april
mark
sent
the
manuscript
i
enclose
the
original
of
sic
as
you
suggest
i
am
afraid
there
are
errors
in
it
also
heedlessness
in
antiquated
spelling
e
stuck
on
often
at
end
of
words
where
they
are
not
strictly
necessary
etc
i
would
go
through
the
manuscript
but
i
am
too
much
driven
just
now
and
it
is
not
important
anyway
i
wish
you
would
do
me
the
kindness
to
make
any
and
all
corrections
that
suggest
themselves
to
you
sincerely
yours
s
charles
erskine
scott
wood
recalled
in
a
foreword
which
he
wrote
for
the
limited
edition
of
issued
by
the
grabhorn
press
how
he
felt
when
he
first
saw
the
original
manuscript
when
i
read
it
writes
wood
i
felt
that
the
character
of
it
would
be
carried
a
little
better
by
a
printing
which
pretended
to
the
eye
that
it
was
contemporaneous
with
the
pretended
i
wrote
mark
that
for
literary
effect
i
thought
there
should
be
a
species
of
forgery
though
of
course
there
was
no
effort
to
actually
deceive
a
scholar
mark
answered
that
i
might
do
as
i
liked
that
his
only
object
was
to
secure
a
number
of
copies
as
the
demand
for
it
was
becoming
burdensome
but
he
would
be
very
grateful
for
any
interest
i
brought
to
the
doing
well
tucker
foreman
of
the
printing
shop
and
i
soaked
some
handmade
linen
paper
in
weak
coffee
put
it
as
a
wet
bundle
into
a
warm
room
to
mildew
dried
it
to
a
dampness
approved
by
tucker
and
he
printed
the
on
a
hand
press
i
had
special
punches
cut
for
such
elizabethan
abbreviations
as
the
a
e
o
and
u
when
followed
by
m
or
n
and
for
the
commonly
and
stupidly
pronounced
ye
the
only
editing
i
did
was
as
to
the
spelling
and
a
few
old
english
words
introduced
the
spelling
if
i
remember
correctly
is
mine
but
the
text
is
exactly
as
written
by
mark
i
wrote
asking
his
view
of
making
the
spelling
of
the
period
and
he
was
enthusiastic
telling
me
to
do
whatever
i
thought
best
and
he
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
thus
was
printed
in
a
de
luxe
edition
of
fifty
copies
the
most
curious
masterpiece
of
american
humor
at
one
of
america
most
dignified
institutions
the
united
states
military
academy
at
west
point
was
so
by
the
archaeological
scholars
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
wrote
clemens
in
his
letter
to
charles
orr
that
i
was
rather
inordinately
vain
of
it
at
that
time
it
had
been
privately
printed
in
several
countries
among
them
japan
a
sumptuous
edition
on
large
paper
was
made
by
lieut
wood
at
west
point
an
edition
of
copies
and
distributed
among
popes
and
kings
and
such
people
in
england
copies
of
that
issue
were
worth
twenty
guineas
when
i
was
there
six
years
ago
and
none
to
be
from
the
depths
mark
twain
irreverence
should
not
be
misinterpreted
it
was
an
irreverence
which
bubbled
up
from
a
deep
passionate
insight
into
the
of
human
nature
in
as
in
man
that
corrupted
hadleyburg
and
in
mysterious
stranger
he
tore
the
masks
off
human
beings
and
left
them
cringing
before
the
public
view
with
the
deftness
of
a
master
surgeon
clemens
dealt
with
human
emotions
and
delighted
in
exposing
human
nature
in
the
raw
the
spirit
and
the
language
of
the
fireside
conversation
were
rooted
deep
in
mark
twain
nature
and
in
his
life
as
wood
who
printed
at
west
point
has
pertinently
observed
if
i
made
a
guess
as
to
the
intellectual
ferment
out
of
which
rose
i
would
say
that
mark
intellectual
structure
and
subconscious
graining
was
from
as
primitive
as
the
common
man
of
the
tudor
period
he
came
from
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
from
the
flatboatmen
pilots
roustabouts
farmers
and
village
folk
of
a
rude
primitive
people
as
lincoln
did
he
was
finished
in
the
mining
camps
of
the
west
among
stage
drivers
gamblers
and
the
men
of
the
simple
roughness
of
a
frontier
people
was
in
his
blood
and
brain
words
vulgar
and
offensive
to
other
ears
were
a
common
language
to
him
anyone
who
ever
knew
mark
heard
him
use
them
freely
forcibly
picturesquely
in
his
unrestrained
conversation
such
language
is
forcible
as
all
primitive
words
are
refinement
seems
to
make
for
weakness
or
let
us
say
a
cutting
edge
but
the
old
vulgar
monosyllabic
words
bit
like
the
blow
of
a
pioneer
ax
and
mark
was
like
that
then
i
think
came
out
of
mark
instinctive
humor
satire
and
hatred
of
puritanism
but
there
is
more
than
this
with
all
its
humor
there
is
a
sense
of
real
delight
in
what
may
be
called
obscenity
for
its
own
sake
whitman
and
the
bible
are
no
more
obscene
than
nature
herself
no
more
obscene
than
a
manure
pile
out
of
which
come
roses
and
cherries
every
word
used
in
was
used
by
our
own
rude
pioneers
as
a
part
of
their
vocabulary
and
no
word
was
ever
invented
by
man
with
obscene
intent
but
only
as
language
to
express
his
meaning
no
act
of
nature
is
obscene
in
itself
but
when
such
words
and
acts
are
dragged
in
for
an
ulterior
purpose
they
become
offensive
as
everything
out
of
place
is
offensive
i
think
he
delighted
too
in
shocking
giving
resounding
slaps
on
what
chaucer
would
quite
simply
call
bare
erse
quite
aside
from
this
chaucerian
erse
slapping
clemens
had
also
a
purpose
that
of
reproducing
a
past
time
as
he
saw
it
in
shakespeare
dekker
jonson
and
other
writers
of
the
elizabethan
era
fireside
conversation
was
an
exercise
in
scholarship
illumined
by
a
keen
sense
of
character
it
was
made
especially
effective
by
the
artistic
arrangement
of
material
into
a
compressed
picture
of
a
phase
of
the
manners
and
even
the
minds
of
the
men
and
women
in
the
spacious
times
of
great
mark
twain
made
of
a
very
smart
and
fascinating
performance
carried
over
almost
to
grotesqueness
just
to
show
it
was
not
done
for
mere
delight
in
the
frank
naturalism
of
the
functions
with
which
it
deals
that
mark
twain
had
made
considerable
study
of
this
frankness
is
apparent
from
chapter
four
of
yankee
at
king
arthur
court
where
he
refers
to
the
conversation
at
the
famous
round
table
thus
many
of
the
terms
used
in
the
most
way
by
this
great
assemblage
of
the
first
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
land
would
have
made
a
comanche
blush
indelicacy
is
too
mild
a
term
to
convey
the
idea
however
i
had
read
tom
jones
and
roderick
random
and
other
books
of
that
kind
and
knew
that
the
highest
and
first
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
england
had
remained
little
or
no
cleaner
in
their
talk
and
in
the
morals
and
conduct
which
such
talk
implies
clear
up
to
one
hundred
years
ago
in
fact
clear
into
our
own
nineteenth
century
in
which
century
broadly
speaking
the
earliest
samples
of
the
real
lady
and
the
real
gentleman
discoverable
in
english
history
or
in
european
history
for
that
matter
may
be
said
to
have
made
their
appearance
suppose
sir
walter
scott
instead
of
putting
the
conversation
into
the
mouths
of
his
characters
had
allowed
the
characters
to
speak
for
themselves
we
should
have
had
talk
from
rebecca
and
ivanhoe
and
the
soft
lady
rowena
which
would
embarrass
a
tramp
in
our
day
however
to
the
unconsciously
indelicate
all
things
are
mark
twain
interest
in
history
and
in
the
depiction
of
historical
periods
and
characters
is
revealed
through
his
fondness
for
historical
reading
in
preference
to
fiction
and
through
his
other
historical
writings
even
in
the
hilarious
youthful
days
in
san
francisco
paine
reports
that
clemens
however
was
never
quite
ready
for
sleep
then
as
ever
he
would
prop
himself
up
in
bed
light
his
pipe
and
lose
himself
in
english
or
french
history
until
his
sleep
paine
tells
us
too
that
lecky
morals
was
an
old
favorite
the
notes
to
prince
and
the
pauper
show
again
how
carefully
clemens
examined
his
historical
background
and
his
interest
in
these
materials
some
of
the
more
important
sources
are
noted

points
out
the
book
is
always
mark
twain
its
parodies
of
tudor
speech
lapse
sometimes
into
a
callow
satisfaction
in
that
idiom
mark
hugely
enjoys
his
nathlesses
and
beshrews
and
the
writing
of
foreshadows
his
fondness
for
this
treatment
do
you
suppose
the
liberties
and
the
brawn
of
these
states
have
to
do
only
with
delicate
with

words
walt
whitman
american

although
was
not
matched
by
any
similar
sketch
in
his

works
it
was
representative
of
mark
twain
the
man
he
was
no
emaciated
literary
bronzed
and
weatherbeaten
son
of
the
west
mark
was
a
man
man
and
that
significant
fact
is
emphasized
by
the
several
phases
of
mark
rich
life
as
steamboat
pilot
printer
miner
and
frontier
journalist
on
the
virginia
city
enterprise
mark
learned
from
editor
daggett
that
when
it
was
necessary
to
call
a
man
names
there
were
no
expletives
too
long
or
too
expressive
to
be
hurled
in
rapid
succession
to
emphasize
the
utter
want
of
character
of
the
man
assailed
there
were
typesetters
there
who
could
hurl
anathemas
at
bad
copy
which
would
have
frightened
a
bengal
tiger
the
news
editor
could
damn
a
mutilated
dispatch
in
in
san
francisco
in
the
sizzling
sixties
we
catch
a
glimpse
of
mark
twain
and
his
buddy
steve
gillis
pausing
in
doorways
to
sing
the
doleful
ballad
of
the
neglected
lover
an
old
piece
of
uncollected
erotica
one
morning
when
a
dog
began
to
howl
steve
awoke
to
find
his
standing
in
the
door
that
opened
out
into
a
back
garden
holding
a
big
revolver
his
hand
shaking
with
cold
and
excitement
relates
paine
in
his
biography
here
steve
he
said
so
chilled
through
i
ca
get
a
bead
on
him
said
steve
shoot
him
just
swear
at
him
you
can
easily
kill
him
at
any
range
with
your
profanity
steve
gillis
declares
that
mark
twain
let
go
such
a
scorching
singeing
blast
that
the
brute
owner
sold
him
the
next
day
for
a
mexican
hairless
nor
did
mark
geysers
of
profanity
cease
spouting
after
these
gay
and
youthful
days
in
san
francisco
with
clemens
it
may
truly
be
said
that
profanity
was
an
art
a
pyrotechnic
art
that
entertained
nations
it
was
my
duty
to
keep
buttons
on
his
shirts
recalled
katy
leary
housekeeper
and
friend
in
the
clemens
menage
and
swear
something
terrible
if
i
did
if
he
found
a
shirt
in
his
drawer
without
a
button
on
he
take
every
single
shirt
out
of
that
drawer
and
throw
them
right
out
of
the
window
rain
or
shine
out
of
the
bathroom
window
they
go
i
used
to
look
out
every
morning
to
see
the
snowflakes
anything
white
out
they
fly
oh
he
swear
at
anything
when
he
was
on
a
rampage
he
swear
at
his
razor
if
it
cut
right
and
clemens
used
to
send
me
around
to
the
bathroom
door
sometimes
to
knock
and
ask
him
what
was
the
matter
well
i
go
and
knock
i
say
clemens
wants
to
know
what
the
matter
and
then
he
say
to
me
kind
of
low
in
a
whisper
like
she
hear
me
katy
i
say
word
oh
well
he
was
ashamed
then
he
was
afraid
of
getting
scolded
for
swearing
like
that
because
clemens
hated
but
his
swearing
never
seemed
really
bad
to
katy
leary
it
was
sort
of
funny
and
a
part
of
him
somehow
she
said
sort
of
amusing
it
was
and
gay
not
like
real
swearing
he
swore
like
an
in
his
later
years
at
stormfield
mark
loved
to
play
his
favorite
billiards
it
was
sometimes
a
wonderful
and
fearsome
thing
to
watch
clemens
play
billiards
relates
elizabeth
wallace
he
loved
the
game
and
he
loved
to
win
but
he
occasionally
made
a
very
bad
stroke
and
then
the
varied
picturesque
and
unorthodox
vocabulary
acquired
in
his
more
youthful
years
was
the
only
thing
that
gave
him
comfort
gently
slowly
with
no
profane
inflexions
of
voice
but
irresistibly
as
though
they
had
the
headwaters
of
the
mississippi
for
their
source
came
this
stream
of
unholy
adjectives
and
choice
mark
vocabulary
ran
the
whole
gamut
of
life
itself
in
paris
in
his
appearance
in
before
the
stomach
club
a
jolly
lot
of
gay
wags
mark
address
reports
paine
obtained
a
wide
celebrity
among
the
clubs
of
the
world
though
no
line
of
it
not
even
its
title
has
ever
found
its
way
into
published
it
is
rumored
to
have
been
called
some
remarks
on
the
science
of
in
berlin
mark
asked
henry
fisher
to
accompany
him
on
an
exploration
of
the
berlin
royal
library
where
the
librarian
having
learned
that
clemens
had
been
the
kaiser
guest
at
dinner
opened
the
secret
treasure
chests
for
the
famous
visitor
one
of
these
guarded
treasures
was
a
volume
of
grossly
indecent
verses
by
voltaire
addressed
to
frederick
the
great
too
much
is
enough
mark
is
reported
to
have
said
when
fisher
translated
some
of
the
verses
i
would
blush
to
remember
any
of
these
stanzas
except
to
tell
about
them
when
i
get
to
when
fisher
had
finished
copying
a
verse
for
him
mark
put
it
into
his
pocket
saying
livy
mark
wife
olivia
is
so
busy
mispronouncing
german
these
days
she
ca
even
attempt
to
get
at
in
his
letters
too
howells
observed
he
had
the
southwestern
the
lincolnian
the
elizabethan
breadth
of
parlance
which
i
suppose
one
ought
not
to
call
coarse
without
calling
one
self
prudish
and
i
was
often
hiding
away
in
discreet
holes
and
corners
the
letters
in
which
he
had
loosed
his
bold
fancy
to
stoop
on
rank
suggestion
i
could
not
bear
to
burn
them
and
i
could
not
after
the
first
reading
quite
bear
to
look
at
them
i
shall
best
give
my
feeling
on
this
point
by
saying
that
in
it
he
was
with
a
nigger
squat
on
her
john
hay
pike
county
ballads
is
there
any
other
explanation
asks
van
wyck
brooks
his
elizabethan
breadth
of
parlance
howells
confesses
that
he
sometimes
blushed
over
mark
twain
letters
that
there
were
some
which
to
the
very
day
when
he
wrote
his
eulogy
on
his
dead
friend
he
could
not
bear
to
reread
perhaps
if
he
had
not
so
insisted
in
former
years
while
going
over
mark
twain
proofs
upon
that
swearing
out
in
an
instant
he
would
never
had
had
cause
to
suffer
from
his
having
his
bold
fancy
to
stoop
on
rank
suggestion
mark
twain
verbal
rabelaisianism
was
obviously
the
expression
of
that
vital
sap
which
not
having
been
permitted
to
inform
his
work
had
been
driven
inward
and
left
there
to
ferment
no
wonder
he
was
always
indulging
in
orgies
of
forbidden
words
consider
the
famous
book
that
fireside
conversation
in
the
time
of
queen
elizabeth
is
there
any
obsolete
verbal
indecency
in
the
english
language
that
mark
twain
has
not
painstakingly
resurrected
and
assembled
there
he
whose
blood
was
in
constant
ferment
and
who
could
not
contain
within
the
narrow
bonds
that
had
been
set
for
him
the
riotous
exuberance
of
his
nature
had
to
have
an
and
he
poured
through
it
a
fetid
stream
of
meaningless
obscenity
the
waste
of
a
priceless
psychic
material
thus
brooks
lumps
with
mark
twain
bawdry
and
interprets
it
simply
as
another
indication
of
frustration
figs
for
fig
leaves
of
course
the
writing
of
such
a
piece
as
raised
the
question
of
freedom
of
expression
for
the
creative
artist
although
little
discussed
at
that
time
it
was
a
question
which
intensely
interested
mark
and
for
a
fuller
appreciation
of
position
one
must
keep
in
mind
the
year
in
which
was
written
there
had
been
nothing
like
it
before
in
american
literature
there
had
appeared
no
caldwells
no
faulkners
no
hemingways
victorian
england
was
gushing
tennyson
in
the
united

of

led
the

of
the
debunkers
scraping
the
gilt
off
the

in
the
gilded
age
in
mark
took
a
few
pot
shots
at
license
in
art
and
literature
in
his
tramp
abroad
i
wonder
why
some
things
are
for
instance
art
is
allowed
as
much
indecent
license
as
in
earlier
times
but
the
privileges
of
literature
in
this
respect
have
been
sharply
curtailed
within
the
past
eighty
or
ninety
years
fielding
and
smollet
could
portray
the
beastliness
of
their
day
in
the
beastliest
language
we
have
plenty
of
foul
subjects
to
deal
with
in
our
day
but
we
are
not
allowed
to
approach
them
very
near
even
with
nice
and
guarded
forms
of
speech
but
not
so
with
art
the
brush
may
still
deal
freely
with
any
subject
however
revolting
or
indelicate
it
makes
a
body
ooze
sarcasm
at
every
pore
to
go
about
rome
and
florence
and
see
what
this
last
generation
has
been
doing
with
the
statues
these
works
which
had
stood
in
innocent
nakedness
for
ages
are
all
now
yes
every
one
of
them
nobody
noticed
their
nakedness
before
perhaps
nobody
can
help
noticing
it
now
the
makes
it
so
conspicuous
but
the
comical
thing
about
it
all
is
that
the
is
confined
to
cold
and
pallid
marble
which
would
be
still
cold
and
unsuggestive
without
this
sham
and
ostentatious
symbol
of
modesty
whereas
paintings
which
do
really
need
it
have
in
no
case
been
furnished
with
it
at
the
door
of
the
ufizzi
in
florence
one
is
confronted
by
statues
of
a
man
and
a
woman
noseless
battered
black
with
accumulated
grime
they
hardly
suggest
human
beings
yet
these
ridiculous
creatures
have
been
thoughtfully
and
conscientiously
by
this
fastidious
generation
you
enter
and
proceed
to
that
little
gallery
that
exists
in
the
world
and
there
against
the
wall
without
obstructing
rag
or
leaf
you
may
look
your
fill
upon
the
foulest
the
vilest
the
obscenest
picture
the
world
possesses
titian
venus
it
is
that
she
is
naked
and
stretched
out
on
a
bed
no
it
is
the
attitude
of
one
of
her
arms
and
hand
if
i
ventured
to
describe
the
attitude
there
would
be
a
fine
howl
but
there
the
venus
lies
for
anybody
to
gloat
over
that
wants
to
and
there
she
has
a
right
to
lie
for
she
is
a
work
of
art
and
art
has
its
privileges
i
saw
young
girls
stealing
furtive
glances
at
her
i
saw
young
men
gaze
long
and
absorbedly
at
her
i
saw
aged
infirm
men
hang
upon
her
charms
with
a
pathetic
interest
how
i
should
like
to
describe
her
just
to
see
what
a
holy
indignation
i
could
stir
up
in
the
world
just
to
hear
the
unreflecting
average
man
deliver
himself
about
my
grossness
and
coarseness
and
all
that
in
every
gallery
in
europe
there
are
hideous
pictures
of
blood
carnage
oozing
brains
putrefaction
pictures
portraying
intolerable
suffering
pictures
alive
with
every
conceivable
horror
wrought
out
in
dreadful
detail
and
similar
pictures
are
being
put
on
the
canvas
every
day
and
publicly
exhibited
without
a
growl
from
anybody
for
they
are
innocent
they
are
inoffensive
being
works
of
art
but
suppose
a
literary
artist
ventured
to
go
into
a
painstaking
and
elaborate
description
of
one
of
these
grisly
things
the
critics
would
skin
him
alive
well
let
it
go
it
can
not
be
helped
art
retains
her
privileges
literature
has
lost
hers
somebody
else
may
cipher
out
the
whys
and
the
wherefores
and
the
consistencies
of
it
i
have
got
professor
scents
pornography
unfortunately
has
recently
been
tagged
by
professor
edward
wagenknecht
as
the
most
famous
piece
of
pornography
in
american
like
many
another
uninformed
is
like
the
little
boy
who
is
shocked
to
see
naughty
words
chalked
on
the
back
fence
and
thinks
they
are
pornography
the
initiated
after
years
of
wading
through
the
mire
will
recognize
instantly
the
significant
difference
between
filthy
filth
and
funny
dirt
for
dirt
sake
is
something
else
again
pornography
an
eminent
american
jurist
has
pointed
out
is
distinguished
by
the
leer
of
the
the
words
which
are
criticised
as
dirty
observed
justice
john
woolsey
in
the
united
states
district
court
of
new
york
lifting
the
ban
on
ulysses
by
james
joyce
are
old
saxon
words
known
to
almost
all
men
and
i
venture
to
many
women
and
are
such
words
as
would
be
naturally
and
habitually
used
i
believe
by
the
types
of
folk
whose
life
physical
and
mental
joyce
is
seeking
to
neither
was
there
pornographic
intent
according
to
justice
woolsey
nor
was
ulysses
obscene
within
the
legal
definition
of
that
word
the
meaning
of
the
word
the
justice
indicated
as
legally
defined
by
the
courts
is
tending
to
stir
the
sex
impulses
or
to
lead
to
sexually
impure
and
lustful
thoughts
whether
a
particular
book
would
tend
to
excite
such
impulses
and
thoughts
must
be
tested
by
the
court
opinion
as
to
its
effect
on
a
person
with
average
sex
instincts
what
the
french
would
call
moyen
sensuel
who
plays
in
this
branch
of
legal
inquiry
the
same
role
of
hypothetical
reagent
as
does
the
man
in
the
law
of
torts
and
learned
man
in
the
art
on
questions
of
invention
in
patent
obviously
it
is
ridiculous
to
say
that
the
leer
of
the
sensualist
lurks
in
the
pages
of
mark
twain
droll
story
in
a
way
observed
william
marion
reedy
is
to
twain
whole
works
what
the
stories
are
to
balzac
it
is
better
than
the
privately
circulated
ribaldry
and
vulgarity
of
eugene
field
is
indeed
an
essay
in
a
sort
of
primordial
humor
such
as
we
find
in
rabelais
or
in
the
plays
of
some
of
the
lesser
stars
that
drew
their
light
from
shakespeare
urn
it
is
humor
or
fun
such
as
one
expects
let
us
say
from
the
peasants
of
thomas
hardy
outside
of
hardy
books
and
though
it
be
filthy
it
yet
hath
a
splendor
of
mere
animalism
of
good
spirits
i
would
say
it
is
scatalogical
rather
than
erotic
save
for
one
touch

indeed
it
seems
more
of
rabelais
than
of
boccaccio
or
masuccio
or
aretino
is
brutally
british
rather
than
lasciviously
latinate
as
to
the
subjects
but
sumptuous

regards
the
immediately
upon
first
reading
john
hay
later
secretary
of

had
proclaimed
a
masterpiece
albert
bigelow
paine
mark
biographer
likewise
acknowledged
its
greatness
when
he
said
is
a
genuine
classic
as
classics
of
that
sort
go
it
is
better
than
the
gross
obscenities
of
rabelais
and
perhaps
in
some
day
to
come
the
taste
that
justified
gargantua
and
the
decameron
will
give
this
literary
refugee
shelter
and
setting

the
more
conventional

of

twain
human
taste
is
a
curious
thing
delicacy
is
purely
a
matter
of
environment
and
point
of
it
depends
on
who
writes
a
thing
whether
it
is
coarse
or
not
wrote
clemens
in
his
notebook
in
i
built
a
conversation
which
could
have
happened
i
used
words
such
as
were
used
at
that
time
i
sent
it
anonymously
to
a
magazine
and
how
the
editor
abused
it
and
the
sender
but
that
man
was
a
praiser
of
rabelais
and
had
been
saying
that
we
had
a
rabelais
i
judged
that
i
could
furnish
him
then
i
took
it
to
one
of
the
greatest
best
and
most
learned
of
divines
rev
joseph
twichell
and
read
it
to
him
he
came
within
an
ace
of
killing
himself
with
laughter
for
between
you
and
me
the
thing
was
dreadfully
funny
i
do
often
write
anything
that
i
laugh
at
myself
but
i
can
hardly
think
of
that
thing
without
laughing
that
old
divine
said
it
was
a
piece
of
the
finest
kind
of
literary
art
and
david
gray
of
the
buffalo
courier
said
it
ought
to
be
printed
privately
and
left
behind
me
when
i
died
and
then
my
fame
as
a
literary
artist
would

first

conversation
as
it
was
by
the
social
fireside
in
the
time
of
the
tudors
the
following
is
supposed
to
be
an
extract
from
the
diary
of
the
pepys
of
that
day
the
same
being
queen
elizabeth
he
is
supposed
to
be
of
ancient
and
noble
lineage
that
he
despises
these
literary
canaille
that
his
soul
consumes
with
wrath
to
see
the
queen
stooping
to
talk
with
such
and
that
the
old
man
feels
that
his
nobility
is
defiled
by
contact
with
shakespeare
and
yet
he
has
got
to
stay
there
till
her
majesty
chooses
to
dismiss
him

sudden
in

taking

with

young
master
beaumont
but
no
have

with

a
before

like
this
was
you
my
learned
and
ingenious
jonson
so
fell
a
blast
hath
mine
ears
saluted
nor
yet
a
stench
so
and
immortal
was
not
a
novice
did
it
good
your
maisty
but
one
of
veteran
experience
else
hadde
he
failed
of

in

ye
my
lord
bacon
lord
from

entrailes
hath
this
prodigy
burst
forth
so
please
your
grace
naught
doth
so
befit
ye
grete
as
grete
performance
and
haply
shall
ye
finde
yt
is
not
from
mediocrity
this
miracle
hath
issued
tho
ye
subjct
be
but
a
fart
yet
will
this
tedious
sink
of
learning
pondrously
phillosophize
meantime
did
the
foul
and
deadly
stink
pervade
all
places
to
that
degree
yt
never
smelt
i
ye
like
yet
dare
i
not
to
leave
ye
presence
albeit
i
was
like
to
suffocate
ye
what
saith
ye
worshipful
master
shaxpur
in
the
great
hand
of
god
i
stand
and
so
proclaim
mine
innocence
though
ye
sinless
hosts
of
heaven
had
foretold
ye
coming
of
this
most
desolating
breath
proclaiming
it
a
work
of
uninspired
man
its
quaking
thunders
its
rottenness
his
own
achievement
in
due
course
of
nature
yet
had
not
i
believed
it
but
had
said
the
pit
itself
hath
furnished
forth
the
stink
and
artillery
hath
shook
the
globe
in
admiration
of
it
then
was
there
a
silence
and
each
did
turn
him
toward
the
worshipful
sr
walter
ralegh
that
browned
embattled
bloody
swashbuckler
who
rising
up
did
smile
and
simpering
say
sr
most
gracious
maisty
was
i
that
did
it
but
indeed
it
was
so
poor
and
frail
a
note
compared
with
such
as
i
am
wont
to
furnish
yt
in
sooth
i
was
ashamed
to
call
the
weakling
mine
in
so
august
a
presence
it
was
nothing
less
than
nothing
madam
i
did
it
but
to
clear
my
nether
throat
but
had
i
come
prepared
then
had
i
delivered
something
worthy
bear
with
me
please
your
grace
till
i
can
make
amends
then
delivered
he
himself
of
such
a
godless
and
blast
that
all
were
fain
to
stop
their
ears
and
following
it
did
come
so
dense
and
foul
a
stink
that
that
which
went
before
did
seem
a
poor
and
trifling
thing
beside
it
then
saith
he
feigning
that
he
blushed
and
was
confused
i
perceive
that
i
am
weak
and
can
not
justice
do
unto
my
powers
and
sat
him
down
as
who
should
say
there
it
is
not
much
yet
he
that
hath
an
arse
to
spare
let
him
fellow
that
an
he
think
he
can
by
god
an
i
were
ye
queene
i
would
tip
this
swaggering
braggart
out
o
the
court
and
let
him
air
his
grandeurs
and
break
his
intolerable
wind
before
ye
deaf
and
such
as
suffocation
pleaseth
then
fell
they
to
talk
about
ye
manners
and
customs
of
many
peoples
and
master
shaxpur
spake
of
ye
boke
of
ye
sieur
michael
de
montaine
wherein
was
mention
of
ye
custom
of
widows
of
perigord
to
wear
uppon
ye
headdress
in
sign
of
widowhood
a
jewel
in
ye
similitude
of
a
member
wilted
and
limber
whereat
ye
queene
did
laugh
and
say
widows
in
england
doe
wear
prickes
too
but
betwixt
the
thighs
and
not
wilted
neither
till
coition
hath
done
that
office
for
them
master
shaxpur
did
likewise
observe
how
yt
ye
sieur
de
montaine
hath
also
spoken
of
a
certain
emperor
of
such
mighty
prowess
that
he
did
take
ten
maidenheddes
in
ye
compass
of
a
single
night
ye
while
his
empress
did
entertain
two
and
twenty
lusty
knights
between
her
sheetes
yet
was
not
satisfied
whereat
ye
merrie
countess
granby
saith
a
ram
is
yet
ye
superior
sith
he
wil
tup
above
a
hundred
yewes
sun
and
sun
and
after
if
he
can
have
none
more
to
shag
will
masturbate
until
he
hath
enrich
whole
acres
with
his
seed
then
spake
ye
damned
windmill
sr
walter
of
a
people
in
ye
uttermost
parts
of
america
yt
capulate
not
until
they
be
five
and
thirty
yeres
of
age
ye
women
being
eight
and
twenty
and
do
it
then
but
once
in
seven
yeres
ye
how
doth
that
like
my
little
lady
helen
shall
we
send
thee
thither
and
preserve
thy
belly
lady
please
your
highnesses
grace
mine
old
nurse
hath
told
me
there
are
more
ways
of
serving
god
than
by
locking
the
thighs
together
yet
am
i
willing
to
serve
him
yt
way
too
sith
your
highnesses
grace
hath
set
ye
ensample
ye
god
wowndes
a
good
answer
childe
lady
mayhap
weaken
when
ye
hair
sprouts
below
ye
navel
lady
nay
it
sprouted
two
yeres
syne
i
can
scarce
more
than
cover
it
with
my
hand
now
ye
hear
ye
that
my
little
beaumonte
have
ye
not
a
little
birde
about
ye
that
stirs
at
hearing
tell
of
so
sweete
a
neste
is
not
insensible
illustrious
madam
but
mousing
owls
and
bats
of
low
degree
may
not
aspire
to
bliss
so
whelming
and
ecstatic
as
is
found
in
ye
downy
nests
of
birdes
of
paradise
ye
by
ye
gullet
of
god
is
a
compliment
with
such
a
tongue
as
thine
lad
spread
the
ivory
thighs
of
many
a
willing
maide
in
thy
good
time
an
thy
be
as
handy
as
thy
speeche
then
spake
ye
queene
of
how
she
met
old
rabelais
when
she
was
turned
of
fifteen
and
he
did
tell
her
of
a
man
his
father
knew
that
had
a
double
pair
of
bollocks
whereon
a
controversy
followed
as
concerning
the
most
just
way
to
spell
the
word
ye
contention
running
high
betwixt
ye
learned
bacon
and
ye
ingenious
jonson
until
at
last
ye
old
lady
margery
wearying
of
it
all
saith
what
mattereth
it
how
ye
shall
spell
the
word
i
warrant
ye
when
ye
use
your
bollocks
ye
shall
not
think
of
it
and
my
lady
granby
be
ye
content
let
the
spelling
be
ye
shall
enjoy
the
beating
of
them
on
your
buttocks
just
the
same
i
trow
before
i
had
gained
my
fourteenth
year
i
had
learnt
that
them
that
would
explore
a
cunt
stop
not
to
consider
the
spelling
sr
in
sooth
when
a
shift
turned
up
delay
is
meet
for
naught
but
dalliance
boccaccio
hath
a
story
of
a
priest
that
did
beguile
a
maid
into
his
cell
then
knelt
him
in
a
corner
to
pray
for
grace
to
be
rightly
thankful
for
this
tender
maidenhead
ye
lord
had
sent
him
but
ye
abbot
spying
through
ye
did
see
a
tuft
of
brownish
hair
with
fair
white
flesh
about
it
wherefore
when
ye
priest
prayer
was
done
his
chance
was
gone
forasmuch
as
ye
little
maid
had
but
ye
one
cunt
and
that
was
already
occupied
to
her
content
then
conversed
they
of
religion
and
ye
mightie
work
ye
old
dead
luther
did
doe
by
ye
grace
of
god
then
next
about
poetry
and
master
shaxpur
did
rede
a
part
of
his
king
henry
ye
which
it
seemeth
unto
me
is
not
of
ye
value
of
an
arsefull
of
ashes
yet
they
praised
it
bravely
one
and
all
ye
same
did
rede
a
portion
of
his
venus
and
adonis
to
their
prodigious
admiration
whereas
i
being
sleepy
and
fatigued
withal
did
deme
it
but
paltry
stuff
and
was
the
more
discomforted
in
that
ye
blody
bucanier
had
got
his
wind
again
and
did
turn
his
mind
to
farting
with
such
villain
zeal
that
presently
i
was
like
to
choke
once
more
god
damn
this
windy
ruffian
and
all
his
breed
i
wolde
that
hell
mighte
get
him
they
talked
about
ye
wonderful
defense
which
old
nicholas
throgmorton
did
make
for
himself
before
ye
judges
in
ye
time
of
mary
which
was
unlucky
matter
to
broach
sith
it
fetched
out
ye
quene
with
a
yt
he
having
so
much
wit
had
yet
not
enough
to
save
his
maidenhedde
sound
for
her
and
ye
quene
did
give
ye
walter
a
look
yt
made
hym
wince
for
she
hath
not
forgot
he
was
her
own
lover
it
yt
olde
day
there
was
silent
uncomfortableness
now
was
not
a
good
turn
for
talk
to
take
sith
if
ye
queene
must
find
offense
in
a
little
harmless
debauching
when
pricks
were
stiff
and
cunts
not
loathe
to
take
ye
stiffness
out
of
them
who
of
this
company
was
sinless
behold
was
not
ye
wife
of
master
shaxpur
four
months
gone
with
child
when
she
stood
uppe
before
ye
altar
was
not
her
grace
of
bilgewater
roger
by
four
lords
before
she
had
a
husband
was
not
ye
little
lady
helen
born
on
her
mother
and
beholde
were
not
ye
lady
alice
and
ye
lady
margery
there
mouthing
religion
whores
from
ye
cradle
in
time
came
they
to
discourse
of
cervantes
and
of
the
new
painter
rubens
that
is
beginning
to
be
heard
of
fine
words
and
phrases
from
the
ladies
now
one
or
two
of
them
being
in
other
days
pupils
of
that
poor
ass
lille
himself
and
i
marked
how
that
jonson
and
shaxpur
did
fidget
to
discharge
some
venom
of
sarcasm
yet
dared
they
not
in
the
presence
the
queene
grace
being
ye
very
flower
of
ye
euphuists
herself
but
behold
these
be
they
yt
having
a
specialty
and
admiring
it
in
themselves
be
jealous
when
a
neighbor
doth
essaye
it
nor
can
abide
it
in
them
long
wherefore
was
observable
yt
ye
quene
waxed
uncontent
and
in
time
labor
grandiose
speeche
out
of
ye
mouth
of
lady
alice
who
manifestly
did
mightily
pride
herself
thereon
did
quite
exhauste
ye
quene
endurance
who
listened
till
ye
gaudy
speeche
was
done
then
lifted
up
her
brows
and
with
vaste
irony
mincing
saith
shit
whereat
they
alle
did
laffe
but
not
ye
lady
alice
yt
olde
foolish
bitche
now
was
walter
minded
of
a
tale
he
once
did
hear
ye
ingenious
margrette
of
navarre
relate
about
a
maid
which
being
like
to
suffer
rape
by
an
olde
archbishoppe
did
smartly
contrive
a
device
to
save
her
maidenhedde
and
said
to
him
first
my
lord
i
prithee
take
out

the

of
indicates
that
twain
must
have
given
the
subject
considerable
thought
the
author
was
careful
to
speak
only
of
men
who
conceivably
might
have
been
in
the
virgin
queen
closet
and
engaged
in
discourse
with
her
the
characters
at
this
time
queen
elizabeth
was
years
old
she
speaks
of
having
talked
to
old
rabelais
in
her
youth
this
might
have
been
possible
as
rabelais
died
in
when
the
queen
was
years
old
among
those
in
the
party
were
shakespeare
at
that
time
years
old
ben
jonson
and
sir
walter
raleigh
beaumont
at
the

he
was
admitted
as
a
member
of
the
inner
temple
in

his

were

if

were
holding

would
beaumont
have
been

to
attend
such
a
gathering
of
august
personages
in
the
year
but
the
point
is
unimportant
the
elizabethan
writers
in
the
conversation
shakespeare
speaks
of
montaigne
essays
these
were
first
published
in
and
successive
editions
were
issued
in
the
years
following
the
third
volume
being
published
in
in
england
montaigne
was
early
popular
it
was
long
supposed
that
the
autograph
of
shakespeare
in
a
copy
of
florio
translation
showed
his
study
of
the
essays
the
autograph
has
been
disputed
but
divers
passages
and
especially
one
in
the
tempest
show
that
at
first
or
second
hand
the
poet
was
acquainted
with
the
encyclopedia
brittanica
the
company

novelist
of

elizabethan
era
whose
novel
euphues
published
in
two
parts
or
the
of

and
his
england
was
a
literary
sensation
it
is
said
to
have
influenced
literary
style
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
traces
of
its
influence
are
found
in
shakespeare
columbia

the
introduction
of
ben
jonson
into

was
wholly
appropriate
if
one
may
call
to

some
of

good
old
english
custom
that
certain
types
of

have
not

in

can
be
noticed
in
some
comparatively

apparently
degenerated
sadly
in
modern
times
and
even
in

it
was
a
serious

my
prize
question
therefore
should
be
to
discover
some
drug
wholesome
and
not
disagreeable
to
be
mixed
with
our
common
food
or
sauces
that
shall
render
the
natural
discharges
of
wind
from
our
bodies
not
only
inoffensive
but
agreeable
as
perfumes
that
this
is
not
a
chimerical
project
altogether
impossible
may
appear
from
these
considerations
that
we
already
have
some
knowledge
of
means
capable
of
varying
that
smell
he
that
dines
on
stale
flesh
especially
with
much
addition
of
onions
shall
be
able
to
afford
a
stink
that
no
company
can
tolerate
while
he
that
has
lived
for
some
time
on
vegetables
only
shall
have
that
breath
so
pure
as
to
be
insensible
of
the
most
delicate
noses
and
if
he
can
manage
so
as
to
avoid
the
report
he
may
anywhere
give
vent
to
his
griefs
unnoticed
but
as
there
are
many
to
whom
an
entire
vegetable
diet
would
be
inconvenient
as
a
little
quick
lime
thrown
into
a
jakes
will
correct
the
amazing
quantity
of
fetid
air
arising
from
the
vast
mass
of
putrid
matter
contained
in
such
places
and
render
it
pleasing
to
the
smell
who
knows
but
that
a
little
powder
of
lime
or
some
other
equivalent
taken
in
our
food
or
perhaps
a
glass
of
lime
water
drank
at
dinner
may
have
the
same
effect
on
the
air
produced
in
and
issuing
from
our
bowels
one
curious
commentary
on
the
text
is
that
elizabeth
should
be
so
fond
of
investigating
into
the
authorship
of
the
exhalation
in
question
when
she
was
inordinately
fond
of
strong
and
sweet
perfumes
in
fact
she
was
responsible
for
the
tremendous
increase
in
importations
of
scents
into
england
during
her
reign
ye
boke
of
ye
sieur
michael
de
montaine
there
is
a
curious
admixture
of
error
and
misunderstanding
in
this
part
of
the
sketch
in
the
first
place
the
story
is
borrowed
from
montaigne
where
it
is
told
inaccurately
and
then
further
corrupted
in
the
telling
it
was
not
the
good
widows
of
perigord
who
wore
the
phallus
upon
their
coifs
it
was
the
young
married
women
of
the
district
near
home
who
paraded
it
to
view
upon
their
foreheads
as
a
symbol
says
our
essayist
of
the
joy
they
derived
if
they
became
widows
they
reversed
its
position
and
covered
it
up
with
the
rest
of
their
the
emperor
mentioned
was
not
an
emperor
he
was
procolus
a
native
of
albengue
on
the
genoese
coast
who
with
bonosus
led
the
unsuccessful
rebellion
in
gaul
against
emperor
probus
even
so
keen
a
commentator
as
cotton
has
failed
to
note
the
error
the
empress
montaigne
does
not
say
his
empress
was
messalina
third
wife
of
the
emperor
claudius
who
was
uncle
of
caligula
and
to
nero
furthermore
in
her
case
the
charge
is
that
she
copulated
with
in
a
single
night
and
not
as
appears
in
the
text
montaigne
is
right
in
his
statistics
if
original
sources
are
correct
whereas
the
author
erred
in
transcribing
the
incident
as
for
proculus
it
has
been
noted
that
he
was
associated
with
bonosus
who
was
as
renowned
in
the
field
of
bacchus
as
was
proculus
in
that
of
venus
gibbon
decline
and
fall
of
the
roman
empire
the
feat
of
proculus
is
told
in
his
own
words
in
vopiscus
hist
augustine
where
he
recounts
having
captured
one
hundred
sarmatian
virgins
and
unmaidened
ten
of
them
in
one
night
together
with
the
happenings
subsequent
thereto
concerning
messalina
there
appears
to
be
no
question
but
that
she
was
a
nymphomaniac
and
that
while
empress
of
rome
she
participated
in
some
fearful
debaucheries
the
question
is
what
to
believe
for
much
that
we
have
heard
about
her
is
almost
certainly
apocryphal
the
author
from
whom
montaigne
took
his
facts
is
the
elder
pliny
who
in
his
natural
history
book
x
chapter
says
other
animals
become
sated
with
veneral
pleasures
man
hardly
knows
any
satiety
messalina
the
wife
of
claudius
caesar
thinking
this
a
palm
quite
worthy
of
an
empress
selected
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
the
question
one
of
the
most
notorious
women
who
followed
the
profession
of
a
hired
prostitute
and
the
empress
outdid
her
after
continuous
intercourse
night
and
day
at
the
but
pliny
notwithstanding
his
great
attainments
was
often
a
retailer
of
stale
gossip
and
in
like
case
was
aurelius
victor
another
writer
who
heaped
much
odium
on
her
name
again
there
is
a
great
hiatus
in
the
annals
of
tacitus
a
true
historian
at
the
period
covering
the
earlier
days
of
the
empress
while
suetonius
bitter
as
he
may
be
is
little
more
than
an
anecdotist
juvenal
another
of
her
detractors
is
a
prejudiced
witness
for
he
started
out
to
satirize
female
vice
and
naturally
aimed
at
high
places
dio
also
tells
of
messalina
misdeeds
but
his
work
is
under
the
same
limitations
as
that
of
suetonius
furthermore
none
but
pliny
mentions
the
excess
under
consideration
however
where
there
is
much
smoke
there
must
be
a
little
fire
and
based
upon
the
superimposed
testimony
of
the
writers
of
the
period
there
appears
little
doubt
but
that
messalina
was
a
nymphomaniac
that
she
prostituted
herself
in
the
public
stews
naked
and
with
gilded
nipples
and
that
she
did
actually
marry
her
chief
adulterer
silius
while
claudius
was
absent
at
ostia
and
that
the
wedding
was
consummated
in
the
presence
of
a
concourse
of
witnesses
this
was
the
straw
that
broke
the
camel
claudius
hastened
back
to
rome
silius
was
dispatched
and
messalina
lacking
the
to
destroy
herself
was
killed
when
an
officer
ran
a
sword
through
her
abdomen
just
as
it
appeared
that
claudius
was
about
to
relent
then
spake
ye
damned
windmill
sir
walter
raleigh
is
thoroughly
in
character
here
this
observation
is
quite
in
keeping
with
the
general
veracity
of
his
account
of
his
travels
in
guiana
one
of
the
most
mendacious
accounts
of
adventure
ever
told
naturally
the
scholarly
researches
of
westermarck
have
failed
to
discover
this
people
perhaps
lady
helen
might
best
be
protected
among
the
jibaros
of
ecuador
where
the

ben
jonson
in
his
conversations
observed
that

esteemed
more
of
fame
than
of

virgin
queene
grave
historians
have
debated
for
centuries
the
pretensions
of
elizabeth
to
the
title
the
virgin
queen
and
it
is
utterly
impossible
to
dispose
of
the
issue
in
a
note
however
the
weight
of
opinion
appears
to
be
in
the
negative
many
and
great
were
the
difficulties
attending
the
marriage
of
a
protestant
princess
in
those
troublous
times
and
elizabeth
finally
announced
that
she
would
become
wedded
to
the
english
nation
and
she
wore
a
ring
in
token
thereof
until
her
death
however
more
or
less
open
liaisons
with
essex
and
leicester
as
well
as
a
host
of
lesser
courtiers
her
ardent
temperament
and
her
imperious
temper
are
indications
that
can
not
be
denied
in
determining
any
estimate
upon
the
point
in
question
ben
jonson
in
his
conversations
with
william
drummond
of
hawthornden
says
queen
elizabeth
never
saw
herself
after
she
became
old
in
a

they
were

to
make

esteame
herself
fortunate
that
she
had
a
membrana
on
her
which
made
her
uncapable

though
for
her
delight
she
tried
many
at
the
coming

there
was
a

chirurgion
who
took

it

again
intrigued

he
was
abroad
with

to
nose
up
everything
pertaining

elizabeth
manly
character
hath

story
the
author
does
not
pay
any
great
compliment
to
raleigh
memory
here
there

no
such

in

the
nearest

the
fourth
of
the
first
day
of
the
decameron
old
nicholas
throgmorton
the
incident
referred

appears
to
be
sir
nicholas
throgmorton
trial
for
complicity
in
the
attempt
to
make
lady
jane
grey
queen
of
england
a
charge
of
which
he
was
acquitted
this
so
angered
queen
mary
that
she
imprisoned
him
in
the
tower
and
fined
the
jurors
from
one
to
two
thousand
pounds
each
her
action
terrified
succeeding
juries
so
that
sir
nicholas
brother
was
condemned
on
no
stronger
evidence
than
that
which
had
failed
to
prevail
before
while
sir
nicholas
defense
may
have
been
brilliant
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
evidence
was
weak
he
was
later
released
from
the
tower
and
under
elizabeth
was
one
of
a
group
of
commissioners
sent
by
that
princess
into
scotland
to
foment
trouble
with
mary
queen
of
scots
when
the
attempt
became
known
elizabeth
repudiated
the
acts
of
her
agents
but
sir
nicholas
having
anticipated
this
possibility
had
sufficient
foresight
to
secure
endorsement
of
his
plan
by
the
council
and
so
outwitted
elizabeth
who
was
playing
a
role
and
cecil
one
of
the
greatest
statesmen
who
ever
held
the
post
of
principal
minister
perhaps
it
was
this
incident
to
which
the
company
referred
which
might
in
part
explain
elizabeth
rejoinder
however
he
had
been
restored
to
confidence
ere
this
and

daie
as
the

has
it
for
it
happened
only
eight
years
before
the
date
of
this
purported
conversation
when
elizabeth
was
sixty
years
old
partial
bibliography
the
various
printings
of
reveal
how
mark
twain
conversation
has
become
a
part
of
the
american
printer
lore
but
more
important
its
many
printings
indicate
that
it
has
become
a
popular
bit
of
american
folklore
particularly
for
men
and
women
who
have
a
feeling
for
mark
twain
apparently
it
appeals
to
the
typographer
who
devotes
to
it
his
worthy
art
as
well
as
to
the
job

unique

the

printing
indeed
the
story
of
the

printings
of
is
almost
legendary
in
the
days
of
the
printer
so
i
am
told
copies
were
carried
from
print
shop
to
print
shop
for
more
than
a
quarter
century
now
it
has
been
one
of
the
chief
sources
of
enjoyment
for
printers
devils
and
many
a
young
rascal
has
learned
about
life
from
this
fireside
conversation
it
has
been
printed
all
over
the
country
and
if
report
is
to
be
believed
in
foreign
countries
as
well
because
of
the
many
surreptitious
and
anonymous
printings
it
is
exceedingly
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
compile
a
complete
bibliography
many
printings
lack
the
name
of
the
publisher
the
printer
the
place
