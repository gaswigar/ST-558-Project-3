noon
smote
down
on
the
field
burning
on
spears
and
helms
shining
from
theseus
shield
as
a
wave
of
the
sea
that
whelms
a
rock
and
its
crest
uprears
through
the
wreck
of
the
trampled
wheat
the
charge
of
the
charioteers
thundering
broke
a
sleet
veiled
light
and
the
air
was
alive
as
with
hissing
of
snakes
as
with
swarms
of
the
spring
by
a
populous
hive
as
with
wind
and
the
clamour
of
storms
so
hurtled
the
arrowy
hail
loosed
from
the
amazon
ranks
smote
ringing
on
brazen
mail
struck
fanged
through
the
shuddering
flanks
of
the
stallions
and
half
were
hurled
in
the
dust
and
broken
and
brayed
by
the
chariots
over
them
whirled
which
eager
and
undismayed
swept
ruining
on
to
the
hordes
of
the
amazonian
camp
with
the
lightning
of
terrible
swords
till
the
dead
were
heaped
as
a
ramp
for
the
quick
but
the
chariots
shocked
on
the
thicket
of
spears
and
the
long
ranks
reeled
and
rocked
broke
and
the
charioteers
went
through
them
cleaving
as
ploughs
cleave
earth
they
were
rent
and
tossed
with
the
tumult
of
tortured
boughs
and
the
stallions
with
foam
embossed
fought
tearing
each
other
with
teeth
in
the
red
blind
rage
of
their
lust
screaming
and
writhed
underneath
the
wounded
trodden
as
must
of
the
grapes
trodden
out
in
the
press
empurpling
the
knees
and
bare
thighs
of
the
men
through
the
stress
of
their
shoulders
drove
as
a
share
hippolyta
avenging
she
came
and
they
streamed
and
they
surged
round
her
car
the
women
her
face
was
a
flame
as
she
rode
through
the
tempest
of
war
and
they
cried
made
glad
with
the
sight
as
those
desiring
the
dawn
when
the
darkness
is
cloven
by
light
cry
for
gladness
they
rallied
upborne
when
she
rayed
as
the
sun
through
their
cloud
but
she
strung
the
bow
and
she
prayed
unto
artemis
calling
aloud
as
a
maid
might
call
to
a
maid
and
the
goddess
of
shining
brows
heard
as
she
paused
from
the
chace
upon
tainaros
hoary
with
snows
and
a
shadow
darkened
her
face
a
shadow
and
then
a
ray
lightening
glorying
smiled
as
her
thought
pierced
years
to
a
day
unborn
and
an
unborn
child
with
the
pure
fount
of
his
praise
lifted
to
her
from
the
shrine
at
the
three
in
a
waste
of
hills
as
wine
gladdening
her
and
she
shed
a
wonder
a
terror
a
fear
a
beauty
that
filled
with
dread
a
glory
no
eyes
might
bear
on
her
maid
stooped
hushed
from
the
height
her
thought
as
a
bird
on
the
wing
rained
down
from
her
swifter
than
light
hippolyta
notched
on
the
string
an
arrow
and
loosed
it
and
smote
as
he
drove
at
her
car
with
a
jest
agelaus
cleaving
his
throat
speechless
and
smote
through
the
breast
polytherses
and
euenor
then
felt
the
teeth
of
the
flints
at
his
veins
as
his
mares
dragged
him
back
to
his
men
all
bloody
entangled
in
reins
then
damastor
she
smote
and
they
fled
as
doves
or
as
linnets
fly
when
a
hawk
that
has
towered
overhead
stoops
ravening
out
of
the
sky
on
their
quires
but
her
arrows
sighed
after
them
swifter
than
feet
they
ran
shrieked
stumbled
and
died
shot
through
with
her
shafts
in
the
wheat
with
the
sunlight
gilding
their
greaves
helmets
and
shields
and
mail
they
lay
strewn
thickly
as
leaves
when
autumn
has
swung
his
flail
but
afar
where
thermodon
rolled
the
deep
swift
strength
of
its
flood
to
the
ocean
turbidly
gold
drave
theseus
eager
for
blood
and
as
herds
stampede
in
affright
at
the
reek
of
the
beast
in
the
air
precipitately
through
the
night
when
a
lion
forth
comes
from
his
lair
so
the
women
before
him
fled
in
a
rout
headlong
overborne
for
he
drave
as
a
beast
all
red
with
the
blood
of
the
prey
he
had
torn
circled
them
round
they
were
rent
whirled
under
him
flung
from
him
far
seaward
and
lost
until
spent
heaped
in
a
mound
by
her
car
broken
and
dying
and
dead
hippolyta
saw
and
she
fled
theseus
followed
afar
over
the
storm
of
the
spears
he
had
seen
her
face
as
a
star
shine
and
no
tremble
of
tears
softened
her
terrible
eyes
cruel
they
shone
there
and
blue
with
the
beauty
of
windless
skies
but
her
bowstring
ever
she
drew
loosening
arrows
that
sang
through
the
air
exulting
as
wind
and
the
clamour
of
battle
rang
most
by
her
car
while
behind
the
fierce
wild
women
upheld
their
queen
and
their
anger
burned
in
staring
eyeballs
she
felled
a
man
as
her
car
overturned
sped
onward
her
swift
white
feet
the
dead
and
the
dying
spurned
who
lay
in
the
wasted
wheat
theseus
followed
his
prey
as
a
lean
hound
follows
the
fleet
quarry
the
dusty
way
smoked
with
the
speed
of
his
feet
she
was
swift
but
he
burned
in
the
chace
he
was
flame
he
was
sandalled
with
fire
hungering
after
her
face
with
a
fury
a
lust
a
desire
as
a
hound
that
whines
for
the
blood
of
the
hart
flying
winged
with
fear
and
she
yearned
and
she
longed
for
the
wood
seeming
far
from
her
still
though
near
and
she
strained
and
she
panted
and
pressed
with
her
head
flung
backward
for
breath
and
the
quick
sobs
shaking
her
breast
agonised
now
as
by
death
fearing
utterly
fighting
with
fate
stumbling
and
swifter
behind
with
a
love
made
hot
by
his
hate
strained
he
pursuing
the
wind
lifted
and
played
with
the
fold
of
her
chlamys
and
showed
made
bare
the
swift
limbs
shining
as
gold
from
sunlight
and
streamed
through
her
hair
as
wind
in
a
cresset
of
fire
as
tresses
of
flame
in
the
night
while
she
fled
desired
from
desire
till
the
brakes
hid
the
flame
from
his
sight
yea
but
no
long
time
he
stood
as
one
who
resigns
the
prize
when
a
moment
baffled
the
wood
hid
her
indeed
from
his
eyes
but
the
track
of
her
feet
lay
clean
as
the
slot
of
a
deer
in
the
grass
slower
he
followed
and
keen
were
his
downcast
eyes
as
a
glass
a
wide
lake
gleamed
in
the
ebb
of
the
latest
tide
of
the
light
stars
shone
clear
through
the
web
of
the
branches
beckoning
night
the
leaves
fell
softly
gilt
with
autumn
and
tawny
and
red
and
the
blue
of
the
skies
lay
spilt
pooled
shining
from
late
rains
shed
the
tall
reeds
seemed
to
dream
by
the
full
lake
murmuring
marge
she
paused
by
a
chiming
stream
listened
awhile
hung
her
targe
from
a
tree
with
her
unstrung
bow
loosened
her
and
greaves
bathing
her
limbs
and
slow
like
a
snake
through
the
fallen
leaves
theseus
crept
on
his
prize
paused
to
gaze
on
her
grace
the
fine
clean
curve
of
the
thighs
pure
brow
and
face
beautiful
knees
and
the
play
of
muscles
splendidly
wrought
theseus
leapt
on
his
prey
laughing
softly
he
sought
ease
from
desire
as
a
flame
struggled
she
still
and
fought
calling
on
artemis
name
who
went
unheeding
her
prayer
beyond
tainaros
streaming
with
floods
till
the
cries
came
faint
through
the
air
dwindling
among
the
woods
for
the
numberless
tongues
of
the
leaves
echoed
with
myriad
cries
low
and
as
plaintive
as
grieves
the
wood
under
darkening
skies
the
quick
sharp
sobs
from
her
breast
came
thick
and
she
to
whom
spears
hurtling
close
were
a
zest
to
battle
felt
the
hot
tears
well
and
fall
from
her
eyes
struggled
not
long
lay
still
theseus
stooped
on
his
prize
drank
of
her
lips
his
fill
la
toussaint
the
wind
wails
overhead
with
a
grieving
sore
and
the
little
souls
of
the
dead
beat
on
the
door
crying
light
and
a
fire
we
have
travelled
far
over
the
plowed
fields
mire
will
ye
lift
the
bar
would
ye
have
us
go
all
night
on
the
windy
ways
who
were
strong
men
once
in
the
light
of
our
own
days
ours
are
the
fields
ye
plow
and
ye
sow
our
wheat
let
us
stretch
our
hands
to
the
glow
of
the
warm
red
peat
we
who
have
lain
in
earth
for
a
long
dark
year
crave
for
our
own
old
hearth
and
ye
will
not
hear
the
fount
o
quiring
voices
of
the
sleepless
springs
o
night
of
beauty
calm
and
odorous
o
bird
of
thrace
that
ever
ceaseless
sings
the
passion
of
thy
music
amorous
my
heart
is
but
a
spring
that
with
its
prayer
is
choric
through
an
april
plenilune
my
music
but
a
rapture
in
the
air
a
nightingale
in
leafy
june
tristram
ah
my
heart
my
heart
it
is
weary
without
her
i
would
that
i
were
as
the
winds
which
play
about
her
for
here
i
waste
and
i
sicken
and
nought
is
fair
to
mine
eyes
nor
night
with
stars
in
her
clouded
hair
nor
all
the
whitening
ways
of
the
stormy
seas
nor
the
leafy
twilight
trembling
under
the
trees
but
mine
hands
crave
for
her
touch
mine
eyes
for
her
sight
my
mouth
for
her
mouth
mine
ears
for
her
footfalls
light
and
my
soul
would
drink
of
her
soul
through
every
sense
thirsting
for
her
as
earth
in
the
heat
intense
for
the
soft
song
and
the
gentle
dropping
of
rain
but
i
sit
here
as
a
smouldering
fire
of
pain
lonely
here
and
the
wind
in
the
forest
grieves
and
i
hear
my
sorrow
sobbing
among
the
leaves
the
soul
of
man
to
ynez
stackable
in
the
soul
of
man
there
are
many
voices
that
silence
wakens
and
sound
restrains
a
song
of
love
that
the
soul
rejoices
with
windy
music
and
murmuring
rains
a
song
of
light
when
the
dawn
arises
and
earth
lies
shining
and
wet
with
dew
and
life
goes
by
in
a
myriad
guises
under
a
heaven
of
stainless
blue
the
willows
bending
over
the
river
where
the
water
ripples
between
the
reeds
where
the
shadows
sway
and
the
pale
lights
quiver
on
floating
lily
and
flowing
weeds
have
whispering
voices
soft
as
showers
of
april
falling
on
upland
lawns
on
the
nodding
harebell
and
pale
through
silver
evens
and
golden
dawns
but
softer
than
love
and
deeper
than
longing
are
the
sweet
frail
voices
of
drifting
ghosts
in
the
soul
of
man
they
are
floating
thronging
as
petals
pale
flickering
hosts
the
venturers
yea
even
such
as
creep
with
eyes
bent
earthward
in
the
little
space
between
the
dawn
and
waning
of
the
day
between
a
sleep
and
sleep
even
these
without
a
fixed
travel
though
tardily
upon
the
way
labouring
while
your
lighter
swifter
sail
soars
rising
over
sudden
hills
of
foam
exultant
through
the
storm
and
eager
flies
like
a
fleet
swallow
up
to
meet
the
gale
that
drives
with
anger
through
the
heaven
dome
clouds
like
great
silver
galleons
in
a
sea
of
skies
for
every
man
and
each
is
like
a
venture
putting
forth
to
sea
voyaging
into
unknown
ways
to
find
kindlier
lands
and
urges
on
to
reach
kingdoms
which
there
may
be
hidden
the
grey
gloom
of
the
sea
behind
fabulous
kingdoms
piled
with
golden
toil
and
the
slow
garnering
of
mortal
dreams
such
as
lured
forth
the
splendid
sails
of
spain
so
journeying
we
in
hope
of
that
great
spoil
steer
hardily
through
all
conflicting
streams
of
ocean
and
count
all
the
exultant
battling
gain
after
night
to
lillie
lovely
thou
art
o
dawn
as
a
maiden
who
wakes
opening
eyes
on
a
world
filled
with
wonder
and
light
after
a
sleep
of
dreams
issuing
clad
in
a
robe
of
blue
and
silver
and
green
from
the
tents
of
god
in
the
east
comest
thou
as
a
thought
slippeth
into
the
mind
of
a
maid
awakened
from
sleep
by
the
swallows
under
the
eaves
twittering
to
their
young
as
a
flower
awakens
in
spring
after
the
sweet
warm
rains
pass
away
and
the
sun
nourishes
it
and
slow
the
curving
petals
unclose
and
a
presence
escapes
from
its
heart
an
odour
remote
and
vague
trembling
upon
the
air
a
frail
mysterious
ghost
that
comes
and
goes
on
the
wind
like
the
inspiration
of
god
lovely
thou
art
o
dawn
coming
shy
as
a
maid
at
nightfall
to
meet
her
love
by
the
ricks
of
clover
and
hay
they
speak
not
but
hands
meet
hands
mouth
mouth
and
desire
broods
like
a
god
in
the
night
under
the
yellow
moon
they
speak
not
having
all
things
lovely
thou
art
o
dawn
healing
comes
in
thine
hands
the
wide
sea
laughs
at
thy
birth
the
multitudinous
waves
ripple
about
thy
feet
for
joy
at
thy
coming
the
birds
shake
the
dew
from
the
leaves
shake
the
song
from
their
throats
the
full
ewes
call
to
the
lambs
lowing
the
cattle
come
to
drink
at
the
pool
bending
they
drink
and
lift
dripping
muzzles
to
gaze
with
patient
satisfied
eyes
over
the
plenteous
earth
while
slowly
out
of
the
fens
and
heavy
the
mist
rises
to
greet
thee
and
spires
of
thin
blue
smoke
that
ascend
trembling
into
the
calm
windless
air
and
float
from
the
habitations
of
man
man
too
cometh
forth
but
he
scarcely
regards
thee
with
eyes
bent
to
the
earth
he
comes
busy
with
cares
of
toil
plotting
to
gain
him
ease
meat
drink
and
warmth
for
his
age
plotting
in
vain
he
goes
out
of
the
ways
of
life
utterly
frustrate
and
spent
gone
who
was
king
of
thy
fields
gone
who
was
lord
of
thy
flocks
like
a
dream
and
his
children
forget
even
they
too
that
he
was
they
turn
to
their
toil
and
eat
sleep
drink
as
of
old
he
did
spinning
the
woof
and
the
warp
of
life
on
the
looms
of
stone
which
the
fates
rule
and
god
yea
we
are
labourers
all
even
as
bees
for
man
gather
the
honey
from
flowers
so
do
we
labour
for
god
unwittingly
yea
and
the
days
bringeth
to
each
his
reward
a
final
sleep
and
a
peace
swiftly
they
pass
the
days
winged
with
flame
are
their
feet
devouring
us
and
our
kin
as
flame
the
stubble
consumes
but
the
grain
is
garnered
perchance
in
the
great
wide
barns
of
god
laid
up
in
a
golden
heap
as
a
wise
king
treasury
is
heaped
with
the
yellow
gold
lovely
thou
art
o
dawn
creating
out
of
the
dark
this
bright
and
beautiful
world
again
and
leading
each
day
as
a
bride
to
man
whence
he
begets
him
wonderful
deeds
and
surely
because
thine
hands
lead
us
at
last
to
peace
lovely
thou
art
o
dawn
april

miss
dora
curtis
april
with
her
fleet
sweet
silver

feet
beat
lightly
on

softly
for
her
sake
break
flowering
the
wet
boughs
by
the
brimming
lake
wake
lilies
every
dawn
broken
on
the
stream
gleam
rays
to
drown
where
weeds
wave
shining
with
her
dream
seem

mine
eyes
have
seen
the

bride
of
the
night
before
whose
footsteps
souls
of
men
are
blown
as
are
dead
leaves
about
the
wind
swift
feet
wherefore
great
sorrow
cometh
through
my
song
a
wind
of
grieving
through
the
branches
wet
when
all
the
alleys
of
the
woods
are
lit
with
yellow
leaves
and
sere
and
full
of
sighs
through
the
bare
woods
she
came
and
pools
of
light
were
darkened
at
her
coming
and
a
moan
broke
from
the
shuddering
boughs
and
all
the
fleet
leaves
whirled
about
her
passage
with
the
throng
of
her
lamenting
ghosts
who
cried
regret
and
passed
as
softly
as
the
bats
that
flit
down
silent
ways
beneath
the
clouded
skies
wherefore
i
grieve
that
no
more
in
my
sight
are
mortal
women
lovely
i
am
grown
amorous
of
her
lips
with
kisses
sweet
for
her
deep
eyes
in
their
enchantment
strong
yea
i
am
wasted
with
my
passion
fret
restless
that
my
poor
worship
may
not
quit
the
pure
light
of
her
face
which
made
me
wise
great
peace
she
hath
and
dreams
for
her
delight
wherewith
she
weaves
upon
the
looms
of
stone
choosing
such
colours
as
she
deemeth
meet
gold
blue
and
vermeil
skeins
and
there
among
her
spools
of
weaving
threads
her
dreams
beget
life
from
her
nimble
fingers
and
quick
wit
mirrored
in
mortal
life
which
fades
and
dies
these
are
made
whole
and
perfect
in
the
bright
broideries
of
her
hands
while
by
her
throne
move
unborn
hours
which
in
her
cave
discrete
she
hideth
though
her
secret
thoughts
prolong
soft
moments
mortal
hearts
so
soon
forget
bright
supple
forms
with
swift
limbs
strongly
knit
moving
as
light
in
dance
as
melodies
wherefore
though
in
the
cold
i
wail
my
plight
and
wander
through
the
hoary
woods
alone
hunted
and
smitten
of
the
wind
and
sleet
among
these
rooted
souls
i
would
not
wrong
the
intense
white
flame
of
beauty
mine
eyes
met
and
married
for
a
moment
in
this
pit
my
blinded
soul
feeds
on
her
memories
go
thou
my
song
tell
her
though
weeping
yet
her
face
is
mine
such
joy
have
i
in
it
i
can
not
shut
the
splendour
from
mine
eyes
eros
glittering
love
is
born
as
the
day
over
the
floods
rising
in
tides
of
light
quenching
glitter
of
stars
gloom
of
the
woods
flowing
into
the
night
out
of
delicate
dreams
out
of
a
sleep
love
awakens
his
eyes
filled
with
marvellous
light
as
from
the
deep
wells
in
the
wakened
skies
glad
is
he
of
the
earth
glad
of
the
gems
morning
strews
on
the
lawn
trembling
on
every
flower
bright
diadems
love
love
too
is
a
dawn
ah
but
not
with
a
peace
not
with
a
light
cometh
he
always
down
like
a
swallow
in
swift
beautiful
flight
nay
as
swimmers
who
drown
those
who
strive
with
his
strength
even
as
fire
fallen
out
of
the
skies
even
as
lightning
hurled
so
his
desire
bright
and
blending
the
eyes
glittering
through
the
storm
cometh
he
then
rending
all
in
his
path

the
implacable
lord
master
of

smites
his
foes

blessed
the
sheaves
and
the
great
garths
and

and
quiet
farms
and
all
the
tawny
and
the
crimson

yea
she
hath
passed
with
poppies
in
her
arms
under
the
star
of
dusk
through
stealing
mist
and
blessed
the
earth
and
gone
while
no
man
wist
with
slow
reluctant
feet
and
weary
eyes
and
eyelids
heavy
with
the
coming
sleep
with
small
breasts
lifted
up
in
stress
of
sighs
she
passed
as
shadows
pass
among
the
sheep
while
the
earth
dreamed
and
only
i
was
ware
of
that
faint
fragrance
blown
from
her
soft
hair
the
land
lay
steeped
in
peace
of
silent
dreams
there
was
no
sound
amid
the
sacred
boughs
nor
any
mournful
music
in
her
streams
only
i
saw
the
shadow
on
her
brows
only
i
knew
her
for
the
yearly
slain
and
wept
and
weep
until
she
come
again
still
life
pale
globes
of
fragrant
ripeness
amber
grapes
and
purple
on
a
silver
dish
a

wise
visions
of
blossoming
boughs
and

roots
and
peaches
ripening
on
a
sunny
wall
blodeuwedd
math
upon
a
summer
day
gathered
blossoms
of
the

which
fell
on
the
surface
of
a
well
silver
froth
and
foam
of
flowers
golden
rays
on
drifting
showers
dew

frost
and

and
he
fashioned
his

a

slim

fair
blodeuwedd
of
the
lovely
hair
blodeuwedd
of
the
shining
face
ranged
the
forest
with
the
grace
of
a
as
wild
wilful
as
a
wanton
child
how
could
men
withhold
their
eyes
from
her
she
was
light
the
skies
dawn
and
dew
to
them
it
seemed
looking
at
her
that
they
dreamed
all
the
joys
of
heaven
had
been
hidden
her
twin
breasts
between
bound
upon
her
tranquil
brows
that
were
white
as
winter
snows
hidden
in
her
curving
lips
folded
round
her
flowing
hips
yea
for
them
she
seemed
to
shine
with
a
beauty
all
divine
blodeuwedd
of
the
little
ears
had
alas
no
gift
of
tears
had
no
heart
at
all
to
love
knew
not
what
deep
sorrows
move
through
the
dim
ways
of
our
heart
knew
of
mortal
grief
no
part
she
like
sunlight
through
the
rain
drifted
through
our
world
of
pain
fed
her
joy
with
myriad
kisses
stolen
pleasures
honeyed
blisses
then
danced
on
her
wanton
way
like
a
gleam
of
gold
through
gray
men
fell
knowing
they
would
fall
for
math
gave
no
heart
at
all
blodeuwedd
i
have
made
in
thee
of
my
love
deep
sorcery
even
as
math
made
the
gay
heartless
one
from
flowers
of
may
foam
and
frost
and
shining

shall
i
find
a

what
are

doing
get
ye
hence
nor
weary
god
with
prayers
but
when
i
die
lay
me
not
there
among
the
peaceful
graves
where
sleep
your
puny
saints
i
would
go
hence
over
the
loud
ways
of
the
sea
again
in
my
black
ship
with
all
the
out
nor
beaten
crawl
unto
the
knees
of
god
to
whine
there
a
whipped
hound
yea
send
me
forth
as
when
i
sought
rich
lands
and
glittering
gold
and
warm
women
and
red
wine
and
all
the
splendour
and
the
lust
of
war
your
eden
lies
among
streams
green
meadows
orchards
of
boughs
red
with
ripe
apples
it
hath
lofty
walls
beyond
our
scaling
that
the
peaceful
folk
may
sleep
each
night
securely
priests
and
convent
women
such
as
wail
all
day
before
lit
candles
in
the
idle
fume
of
incense
rising
i
would
go
where
sit
tall
odin
and
his
sons
thor
hermod
tyr
and
heimdail
frey
and
niord
with
the
mother
of
the
gods
and
freya
and
idun
and
brage
harping
there
the
heroes
are
whose
armour
rusts
in
ocean
and
young
men
who
fared
with
me
adventuring
and
lie
now
in
an
alien
earth
or
derelict
drift
upon
the
washings
of
the
eternal
tides
but
they
still
live
in
asgard
drinking
joy
of
battle
and
of
music
and
of
love
only
i
i
grow
old
and
bowed
in
head
while
the
dark
hour
approaches
and
the
night
exploring
mine
own
soul
and
lost
therein
i
too
would
go
and
eat
of
idun
apples
the
golden
fruit
whereof
the
taste
gives
youth
perpetual
and
strength
of
hands
renewed
be
praised
by
brage
and
see
freya
there
the
whose
deep
eyes
are
lit
with
all
love
perilous
pleasures
i
would
ride
over
the
glittering
bifrost
bridge
with
thor
and
the
great
host
of
heroes
with
the
wind
playing
upon
our
banners
and
the
dawn
leaping
as
flame
from
all
the
lifted
swords
and
press
of
spears
and
some
day
we
shall
come
battering
at
the
crystal
walls
of
heaven
with
brazen
clangour
of
arms
and
burn
the
towers
to
be
our
torches
and
make
all
the
streets
of
jasper
and
chalcedony
and
pearl
slippery
with
the
bloodshed
will
your
saints
pray
back
the
onslaught
of
our
lusting
swords
with
any
prayers
i
would
not
lie
in
earth
under
the
sheep
but
send
me
once
again
out
through
the
storms
and
though
i
lie
there
cold
and
stiff
in
my
bronze
harness
i
shall
hear
the
exultation
of
the
waves
the
might
of
aegir
and
the
creaking
of
the
helm
and
dream
the
helm
is
in
mine
hands
again
while
my
long
ship
leaps
up
like
a
live
thing
against
the
engulphing
waters
and
triumphing
rides
through
thunder
of
turbulent
surges
and
streaming
seas
lifting
and
swaying
from
trough
to
crest
and
trough
with
tense
and
grinding
timbers
while
the
wind
screams
in
the
cordage
and
the
splitten
sail
ye
have
loved
women
some
of
ye
and
know
therefore
how
i
have
loved
the
fickle
sea
blue
in
the
sunlight
sometimes
as
the
eyes
of
laughing
children
wanton
as
a
girl
and
then
all
hunger
for
us
men
all
fierce
passionate
longing
and
then
gray
with
rain
sullen
a
very
harlot
is
the
sea
a
thing
for
men
to
master
full
of
moods
treacherous
as
you
see
it
when
it
crawls
snakily
over
sunken
rocks
or
slinks
furtively
by
and
snarls
to
show
its
teeth
like
a
starved
wolf
many
a
goodly
man
women
have
loved
and
slain
but
more
the
sea
though
i
forget
they
are
meeker
women
here
submissive
to
their
master
they
are
not
the
wild
things
that
men
warred
with
in
my
youth
haggards
to
gentle
these
doves
who
flutter
round
our
footsteps
croon
and
coo
amorous
music
through
the
languorous
nights
low
laughter
stifled
by
close
kisses
shut
hot
on
the
laughing
lips
love
being
a
game
now
of
your
tamer
with
soft
speech
but
love
to
me
was
no
light
laughter
heard
under
a
sickle
moon
when
blossoming
brakes
thrill
with
the
nightingales
and
eve
is
hushed
like
a
blind
maid
whose
eyes
are
shut
and
seem
to
shut
within
herself
her
secret
thoughts
lest
men
should
know
them
and
be
ware
of
love
and
waken
eager
eager
love
to
me
pulsed
in
the
fingers
and
would
clasp
what
seems
so
aerial
a
vision
to
have
to
hold
to
drink
of
and
i
knew
how
flesh
could
bound
spirit
so
that
we
lay
drowsed
close
to
sleep
near
as
our
bodies
might
yet
sundered
thus
with
how
irreparable
loss
all
time
unborn
or
buried
meeting
with
our
mouths
in
a
swift
marriage
and
the
sacred
night
sweet
with
the
song
of
arrowy
desires
shot
from
the
bow
of
life
into
our
quick
and
rooted
there
yea
life
in
one
full
pulse
and
then
the
glory
darkened
withered
dead
with
lips
dissevered
and
with
sundered
limbs
and
two
where
had
been
one
in
the
gray
dawn
sigurd
my
son
look
where
thy
mother
sits
in
the
round
archway
on
her
carven
chair
and
gazes
over
the
unquiet
waves
toward
the
horizon
calm
as
if
there
lay
peace
and
the
heart
desire
after
much
pain
fulfilled
at
last
quietly
sitting
there
she
peoples
all
the
blue
of
sea
and
skies
with
golden
hopes
of
youth
giving
them
life
from
her
own
yearning
though
they
are
long
dead
and
havened
where
dead
years
are
such
still
eyes
she
hath
and
that
strange
patience
women
have
whose
dreams
are
broken
love
with
a
keen
sword
smote
me
i
saw
the
blue
flame
leap
and
fall
when
first
i
saw
her
eyes
and
dim
the
earth
and
warfare
and
seafaring
and
the
life
which
sang
and
went
with
joyful
colours
clad
became
until
they
were
as
frail
as
dreams
while
as
they
died
in
dusk
her
face
grew
fair
swimming
upon
tired
senses
as
there
swims
up
from
the
wreck
of
day
the
night
first
star
quickening
through
the
silence
so
in
her
the
music
and
the
colour
of
the
world
the
splendours
of
the
earth
and
sky
and
sea
were
shadowed
all
of
life
was
in
her
eyes
her
house
a
shambles
and
i
standing
there
a
beast
all
red
with
slaughter
one
white
face
like
a
white
star
was
it
not
kingly
spoil
what
man
had
not
felt
hunger
in
his
hands
to
flutter
over
the
smooth
flesh
and
know
the
wonder
breathing
so
even
i
must
grasp
that
winged
brief
fragile
beauty
with
rude
strength
fierce
from
the
haste
of
hunger
ere
i
knew
what
god
had
breathed
his
fire
into
my
clay
yea
ere
i
knew
while
yet
i
thought
the
gold
mere
dross
for
traffic
in
the
such
ware
as
i
had
dealt
in
mine
eyes
now
see
her
as
she
was
then
the
tall
slim
grace
the
golden
head
upon
its
silver
stalk
as
frail
as
april
dewy
lilies
are
upon
some
wakening
lawn
or
as
she
lay
with
long
smooth
supple
thighs
and
little
breasts
bared
while
mine
eyes
drank
all
the
beauty
in
as
earth
drinks
dawn
with
gladness
but
her
eyes
veiled
suddenly
and
quick
red
stained
her
cheeks
flickering
and
the
bright
soul
fled
from
sight
to
its
obscure
recesses
while
my
heart
filled
drop
by
drop
with
that
strange
wine
of
joy
which
raced
like
fire
through
me
until
each
sense
ached
for
the
joy
it
gave
and
thirsted
more
in
plundering
such
pleasure
but
her
soul
fled
beyond
reach
of
hands
remote
and
veiled
she
lay
there
as
if
dead
and
all
my
love
was
no
more
to
her
than
the
idle
strength
which
breaks
upon
the
beaches
i
could
feel
sometimes
she
breathed
beside
me
and
her
breath
came
soft
and
warm
through
the
red
parted
lips
fragrant
upon
my
face
that
night
was
filled
with
myriad
voices
myriad
stars
and
dews
all
choric
yea
the
very
darkness
glowed
with
secret
heat
as
if
the
night
were
quick
by
love
own
lord
and
pregnant
with
a
flame
so
was
she
mine
by
the
sword
right
whose
heart
went
dreaming
out
over
the
unquiet
sea
to
bergthorsknoll
and
sigurd
olaf
son
such
an
one
as
the
hearts
of
maids
desire
being
tall
and
straight
and
comely
never
a
man
made
such
a
friend
or
foe
on
land
or
sea
his
hands
were
skilful
i
can
love
such
men
in
friendship
or
in
fighting
he
had
come
to
swinefell
in
his
when
spring
was
white
and
ruddy
in
the
fields
and
woods
and
they
perchance
had
bent
down
the
fire
as
day
was
closing
and
had
spoken
low
in
the
dim
light
and
he
had
sailed
in
june
southward
for
prey
descending
toward
the
seine
with
help
from
thrain
the
white
in
ships
and
men
and
i
had
come
in
autumn
with
my
swords
for
vengeance
of
a
wrong
and
left
thrain
stead
and
town
a
heap
of
ash
being
in
wrath
though
it
were
shame
to
burn
so
tall
a
town
as
men
said
but
the
heart
of
me
was
grieved
for
some
slight
he
had
put
on
me
and
black
is
a
man
anger
so
i
gave
his
stead
a
prey
to
the
red
flames
and
fighting
died
thrain
a
man
death
but
when
i
throned
her
here
men
came
and
said
lo
now
will
sigurd
come
for
love
of
her
to
take
her
hence
again
and
burn
lithend
for
vengeance
but
i
said
running
my
fingers
down
the
smooth
keen
blade
sigurd
will
come
why
then
let
sigurd
come
but
they
all
feared
him
and
again
one
spoke
saying
thy
love
will
burn
us
and
our
town
are
there
not
many
women
in
the
world
to
mate
with
but
the
one
he
loves
i
struck
the
craven
fool
a
damned
blow
in
the
face
whereat
they
kept
their
counsel
and
were
still
but
one
man
riding
over
a
wild
moor
when
the
black
night
was
blacker
with
a
storm
saw
in
the
play
of
lightnings
from
the
clouds
twelve
armoured
women
riding
and
they
swooped
on
the
earth
and
riding
came
to
a
lone
house
and
spying
through
a
chink
he
saw
them
weave
a
scarlet
web
of
war
with
swords
for
shuttles
and
men
heads
for
weights
and
they
sang
at
their
weaving
in
those
days
we
sowed
our
corn
with
axes
in
our
belts
and
each
man
armoured
and
my
people
went
fearfully
gazing
out
with
anxious
eyes
over
the
seas
for
an
unfriendly
sail
while
i
sat
silent
eating
mine
own
heart
until
one
ran
with
speed
to
me
as
night
came
dropping
silence
on
the
shining
sea
a
man
with
lucky
eyes
who
cried
they
come
pointing
toward
the
rim
of
ocean
red
with
the
sun
blood
and
that
sight
gladdened
me
to
see
their
slack
sails
idle
in
a
gore
of
dying
glories
while
their
oars
dripped
fire
labouring
up
against
the
ebbing
tide
they
will
come
weary
said
i
and
perchance
lack
water
and
i
set
an
ambush
there
where
rangriver
turns
bitter
with
the
sea
if
thirst
should
lure
them
and
they
came
with
skins
to
fill
and
there
we
played
a
little
while
with
knives
and
axes
while
they
ran
and
tripped
over
gnarled
roots
and
boulders
in
the
dark
calling
their
friends
and
knew
not
where
they
ran
for
we
would
call
the
names
we
heard
them
call
in
feigning
and
thus
lure
them
from
the
path
twenty
tall
fellows
slew
we
in
this
wise
making
the
odds
more
even
and
that
night
they
watched
their
ships
and
lit
the
beach
with
fires
so
that
they
might
not
fight
an
unseen
foe
who
struck
them
through
the
darkness
but
i
went
homeward
and
to
the
chamber
where
she
lay
sleeping
with
tears
upon
her
face
but
sleep
had
stilled
her
troubles
as
i
looked
on
her
her
breath
came
softly
like
a
child
i
watched
wondering
if
death
might
hold
as
fair
a
thing
hungering
though
i
would
not
break
her
dreams
all
night
i
watched
her
that
mine
heart
might
keep
one
face
to
dream
of
through
the
dark
of
death
if
he
should
slay
me
then
a
sense
of
dawn
stole
gradually
through
the
blue
wet
air
cool
dawn
with
dew
and
silence
fair
and
fresh
in
the
white
light
she
lay
there
and
i
looked
long
on
her
and
i
left
her
then
and
went
calling
my
men
and
led
them
thence
afield
to
a
smooth
level
sward
for
fighting
made
between
the
gray
bents
and
the
leafy
woods
a
for
maidens
such
a
stir
came
from
the
beached
black
ships
as
april
hears
about
the
populous
hives
when
the
blown
scents
lure
to
their
garnering
the
frugal
bees
and
they
swarm
forth
so
swarmed
upon
the
shore
sigurd
men
some
by
the
fires
eating
some
buckling
on
their
gleaming
arms
shouting
their
beating
on
their
shields
full
of
rude
jests
and
i
saw
sigurd
there
standing
apart
and
great
of
limb
with
a
soft
silken
kirtle
and
his
helm
winged
flaming
in
the
sunlight
then
my
men
halted
for
vantage
of
the
broken
ground
while
i
strode
out
upon
the
sward
and
called
to
sigurd
but
blind
rage
gat
hold
of
him
and
he
came
at
me
whirling
his
bright
axe
and
i
leapt
out
to
meet
him
so
men
say
laughing
and
ran
upon
him
and
his
blow
broke
down
my
guard
and
bit
the
but
mine
axe
clove
clean
through
the
angry
face
right
to
the
brain
and
as
i
drew
it
back
he
swayed
and
fell
and
his
bronze
armour
rang
loudly
and
from
both
armies
came
a
shout
crying
sigurd
is
slain
sigurd
is
slain
one
mourning
and
one
joyous
while
my
men
stood
round
him
prone
and
marvelled
at
his
strength
and
no
one
feared
him
now
but
they
came
on
avenging
and
the
crashing
of
their
shock
broke
round
us
and
the
ringing
blows
and
shouts
and
screams
of
dying
men
were
born
aloft
with
dust
of
battle
and
lightening
axes
whirled
lifting
and
falling
keen
and
bright
and
blue
they
fell
but
they
were
lifted
dull
and
red
while
we
rolled
backward
and
forward
in
waves
of
fight
and
fluctuating
chance
and
those
who
fell
drowned
there
amid
the
press
of
trampling
feet
so
all
day
long
the
uncertain
combat
flowed
between
the
gray
bents
and
the
broken
ground
and
the
smooth
sward
was
cumbered
with
the
dead
on
whom
we
stumbled
but
at
last
the
night
came
shadowing
with
her
blue
veils
the
sea
and
we
and
they
drew
off
and
when
the
noise
of
war
was
stilled
and
only
moans
of
men
broke
silence
with
the
laughter
of
the
sea
that
curled
and
foamed
and
rippled
on
the
beach
i
hailed
them
and
they
answered
me
and
sent
tall
flosi
son
of
gunnar
their
best
man
since
sigurd
fell
over
the
level
sward
now
with
the
dead
strown
thick
as
shocks
of
corn
after
a
reaping
strode
he
and
the
moon
tipped
his
bright
spear
with
silver
lit
his
helm
and
burnished
shield
but
when
his
eyes
and
mine
met
and
he
knew
me
he
stood
waiting
there
and
i
spoke
pointing
with
my
spear
to
those
white
faces
staring
sightless
to
the
moon
from
the
smooth
sward
lo
let
us
make
a
truce
and
mourn
these
dead
for
they
were
goodly
men
my
friends
or
thine
who
lie
there
strengthless
now
with
sigurd
whom
i
slew
him
men
shall
mourn
in
bergthorsknoll
as
the
bright
gods
in
heaven
mourn
golden
balder
but
his
praise
shall
be
within
the
hearts
and
on
the
lips
of
men
a
song
for
ever
him
i
hated
not
nay
rather
loved
though
he
bore
hate
to
me
for
swinefell
spoiling
and
for
gudrun
sake
her
whom
mine
eyes
beholding
straight
mine
heart
desired
with
all
its
strength
so
for
one
prize
strove
we
nor
could
we
yield
but
one
must
die
whence
lies
he
there
the
gods
have
willed
it
so
but
let
us
build
a
pyre
within
his
ship
heaped
up
with
spoil
and
let
us
mourn
for
him
and
launch
him
burning
on
the
eternal
sea
and
when
the
dawn
of
the
third
day
is
red
if
your
mind
is
for
fighting
we
shall
fight
again
or
ye
shall
launch
your
ships
and
go
over
the
bright
ways
of
the
shining
sea
i
spake
and
flosi
answered
gazing
down
upon
the
dead
whose
armour
glimmered
there
under
the
shining
moon
as
glimmer
pools
innumerable
in
the
leafless
woods
yea
one
slim
maid
hath
slain
too
many
men
well
is
she
gudrun
called
unto
men
hearts
a
snare
and
peril
what
is
in
one
face
that
men
should
die
for
it
a
kitchen
slut
to
some
dull
clown
is
royal
but
he
lies
there
and
i
can
not
hold
mine
heart
from
tears
so
loved
i
him
i
count
all
women
light
as
flax
beside
his
loss
why
didst
not
thou
when
we
two
met
amid
the
ringing
blows
and
mine
axe
failed
me
strike
and
i
to
him
impatient
for
my
wound
was
cold
and
irked
my
shoulder
go
and
boast
among
the
ships
that
helgi
fled
thee
helmsdale
held
me
once
i
could
not
slay
thee
for
kiartan
sake
and
he
astonied
stood
there
as
if
light
fell
on
remembered
places
in
his
heart
kiartan
o
kiartan
broke
from
him
in
one
long
sigh
and
he
drew
in
his
breath
quickly
remembering
his
brother
stead
above
the
bays
and
his
heart
saw
his
mother
bend
down
over
the
bright
hearth
with
her
sweet
patient
face
so
old
and
wise
lit
by
the
flickering
firelight
thus
he
stood
forgetting
war
and
death
and
when
he
spoke
again
his
voice
was
changed
and
soft
in
speech
while
we
went
down
toward
the
twinkling
fires
that
lit
the
shore
and
set
a
watch
with
brands
to
scare
the
wolves
who
barked
within
the
woods
snuffing
the
tainted
air
and
flosi
came
alone
of
all
the
jarls
up
to
mine
house
while
they
abode
there
and
when
dawn
was
red
upon
the
third
day
launching
their
black
ships
they
went
upon
the
bright
ways
of
the
sea
softly
the
sails
dropped
down
that
sea
of
light
under
the
milky
skies
all
liquid
gold
the
pure
fire
broken
by
the
cleaving
prows
and
whitening
in
their
wake
as
i
watched
them
i
thought
all
life
went
thus
man
voyaging
heart
over
the
loud
glad
golden
ways
of
time
with
oars
taught
by
a
song
to
seek
some
joy
some
rapture
some
warm
isle
in
happy
seas
adventuring
a
lure
there
is
for
us
in
far
horizons
misty
lands
a
voice
that
calls
us
yea
but
look
on
love
she
lay
there
who
but
two
nights
past
had
watched
one
burning
ship
drift
over
the
sea
rim
into
the
dark
was
she
not
mine
indeed
now
whom
mine
arm
had
won
all
mine
all
mine
the
long
bright
braids
of
hair
the
little
breasts
like
cups
of
carven
ivory
the
smooth
cool
marble
whiteness
curves
one
knew
by
touch
only
too
gradual
for
eyes
it
seemed
god
hands
there
had
felt
joy
in
them
and
wrought
delighting
and
the
blue
eyes
brimmed
with
light
and
thee
my
son
forged
in
the
intense
hour
flame
and
inmost
heat
of
whiteness
mine
all
mine
all
mine
and
yet
some
shadow
slipped
from
me
some
frail
soft
sweet
intangible
delight
escaping
from
mine
hands
so
have
i
gone
over
blue
windless
seas
bare
of
all
life
and
urged
the
labouring
oars
but
every
dawn
showed
still
the
same
blue
stainless
shield
whose
boss
was
our
one
ship
until
it
hushed
our
songs
that
deep
vast
desolating
blue
of
sky
and
tranquil
waters
i
had
all
of
her
but
some
few
drops
of
joy
she
yielded
not
they
being
hers
to
give
or
keep
a
dew
distilled
within
her
soul
yea
i
loved
her
i
think
no
love
is
peace
and
we
but
break
against
each
other
and
our
hands
are
vain
to
grasp
what
is
worth
holding
and
our
sense
too
coarse
a
net
to
snare
what
no
speech
saith
we
go
alone
through
all
our
days
alone
even
when
all
is
given
but
him
she
loved
and
dreamed
upon
his
face
remembering
even
so
i
am
glad
yea
all
my
heart
is
glad
i
had
her
for
mine
own
i
grasped
the
joy
the
quick
warm
breathing
life
and
if
the
dream
fled
from
me
yet
mine
hands
held
priceless
things
and
dreams
are
winged
to
fly
they
are
poor
fools
who
deem
the
better
love
is
a
bowed
heart
and
silent
lips
if
thou
hadst
beauty
close
because
the
white
bird
fluttered
on
thy
breast
wouldst
loose
it
or
would
not
a
quicker
pulse
beat
in
thine
heart
and
eager
fingers
close
more
firmly
on
the
snowy
ruffled
plumes
till
the
thing
yielded
panting
will
ye
win
then
must
ye
dare
there
is
a
lean
saint
stalled
somewhere
among
my
scullions
in
the
stead
a
rat
we
haled
from
out
the
sea
who
says
god
saved
him
he
stakes
his
poor
life
having
not
strength
enough
to
lift
mine
axe
against
a
greater
glory
love
to
him
is
as
a
golden
net
to
snare
his
feet
and
women
perilous
lures
he
would
keep
them
maids
nor
make
one
mother
but
would
rather
see
life
which
the
gods
made
lovely
fade
and
die
ashen
as
winter
woods
nor
break
again
in
all
the
foaming
blossom
of
the
spring
whitening
every
field
he
never
knew
the
keen
sweet
joy
that
smites
through
every
sense
into
the
shuddering
soul
and
whelms
the
world
in
an
immortal
glory
while
god
builds
life
beyond
us
creating
out
of
clay
the
world
imperishable
dream
the
hope
the
wonder
the
desire
that
gives
us
sight
beyond
our
mortal
doom
i
have
little
wit
i
only
know
that
in
the
looms
of
time
god
will
moves
like
a
shuttle
to
and
fro
i
have
heard
him
in
the
waves
and
on
the
wind
i
have
seen
his
splendour
shine
among
the
swords
soften
the
eyes
of
women
light
and
smile
on
a
child
lips
and
know
his
presence
there
where
all
the
waves
stream
eagerly
to
lick
the
sunset
bloody
splendours
balder
the
bright
beautiful
balder
whose
eyes
hold
our
hope
who
hath
made
love
a
light
and
life
a
song
in
all
men
eyes
and
on
their
lips
who
hath
sown
the
fields
of
heaven
thick
with
golden
fires
as
men
sow
corn
and
forges
in
this
flame
of
life
with
ringing
blows
a
strong
man
soul
as
swords
are
fashioned
straight
and
blue
how
shall
i
die
dispraising
thee
whose
praise
comes
laden
with
the
blown
scents
of
the
spring
opening
dewy
eyelids
of
bright
buds
and
brings
the
swallows
thee
i
will
not
curse
nor
life
nor
women
nor
the
fool
himself
who
blinks
weak
eyes
and
calls
the
glory
vain
the
sea
is
darkened
now
and
i
can
hear
the
long
moan
of
the
waves
upon
the
shore
some
fret
is
on
me
i
would
go
again
over
the
gray
fields
of
the
restless
sea
among
the
vexed
waves
and
the
stinging
spray
nay
one
drowns
here
in
death
and
why
not
there
to
wash
about
among
the
changing
tides
under
the
changing
moon
i
would
not
rest
within
a
little
earth
as
sigurd
went
send
me
and
she
will
watch
me
burning
drift
over
the
rim
of
ocean
ere
i
sink
into
the
dark
still
deeps
where
are
ribbed
wrecks
and
strong
men
dead
lo
it
is
time
to
die
for
the
old
glory
fades
out
of
the
world
and
the
swords
rust
in
peace
yea
i
would
go
now
for
this
death
is
but
another
sea
to
venture
on
a
strong
man
will
win
through
and
cast
up
somewhere
on
another
shore
with
his
old
lust
for
fighting
all
of
life
i
have
seen
and
many
cities
of
proud
kings
and
i
have
gotten
gold
and
wine
and
fame
among
strange
peoples
and
white
girls
were
mine
to
love
a
little
while
on
drowsy
nights
when
a
low
yellow
moon
lights
up
a
land
full
of
ripe
stooks
now
it
is
time
to
go
regretting
nothing

lay
the

moved

no

stirred
its

silence
dreamed

like
dew
upon

it
fell
upon
my

loosed
it
to
soar
and
pass
beyond
the

control
vague

it
woke
shapes
far
too
frail

the

broke

i

is

this
the

strengthens
it
with
peace
she
reaps
the
moments
as
the
ears
are
reaped
of
earth
increase
the
house
in
the
wood
i
build
of
fair
and
fleeting
things
a
little
home
for
love
in
thickets
where
the
linnet
sings
my
house
is
roofed
above
with
aspen
leaves
that
never
cease
their
whispering
though
winds
have
peace
and
when
the
autumn
comes
the
roof
is
shed
in

so
sing
i
this

love
passes
with

ruined

shall

this

will
keep
sacred

gathered
gloom

have
hung
their

surely
no

depth
of

will
close
her

wrought
for

bid
her

they

hear
thee

i

at

thou

to
put
out

at
thy
commands
through
the
thin

it
in

thy
two

consecrate
afresh

all

up

the
reconciling
night
holds
thee
for

delight
beyond

the
wind
is
still
and
the
night
full
of
sighs
hast
thou
drunk
thy
fill
of
mine
eyes
yea
of
thine
eyes
but
my
heart
is
for
what
stirred
first
like
a
light
in
the

like
a
light
that
flows
over
barriers
it

and
it
goes

of

sleep
curtained
round
by

thee
as

their

me
the
lost
moments
to
regain
the
hours
dance
round
me
on
their
slender
feet
with
joys
that
pierce
my
heart
as
keen
as

that
were
fleet
to
vanish
or
dissolve
in
dew
of
tears
seeing
them
thus
i
can
not

weep
surely
in
this

god
shall
reap
the
years

with
the
fruits
of
love
from
fields
of
sleep
yea
it
is
dawn
alas
gray
is
the
earth
and
cold
swift
was
our
night
to
pass
thy
hair
is
like
fine
gold
over
the
pillows
spread
and
on
the
sheet
white
fold
the
light
falls
on
thine
head
and
trembles
in
thine
eyes
from
which
the
dreams
have
fled
but
they
keep
memories
love
burnt
us
up
like
grass
surely
love
never
dies
yea
it
is
dawn
alas
death
and
memory
death
hath
not
slain
thee
all
when
twilight
spends
her
liquid
amber
in
the
latest
ebb
withdrawing
and
the
day
in
silence
ends
expectant
of
the
stars
when
through
the
web
of
woven
boughs
fall
glimmering
silver
spears
our
dreaming
heart
will
stir
as
if
a
light
caress
had
touched
it
and
fill
up
with
tears
remembering
nor
only
with
the
night
fall
that
sweet
sadness
light
in
a
dark
place
memory
shrouded
in
her
shrine
of
flesh
the
soul
sits
brooding
veiled
of
form
and
face
by
time
and
in
our
mortal
nature
mesh
trammelled
yet
sometimes
hears
the
sound
of
wings
and
sees
far
off
divine
immortal
things
death
and
nature
when
my
poor
bones
are
hearsed
in
quiet
clay
and
final
sleep
hath
sealed
my
wondering
eyes
the
moon
as
now
will
sail
through
tranquil
skies
the
soft
wind
in
the
play
and
sacred
eve
with
eyelids
dream
and
dawn
with
rosy
fingers
draw
the
veils
of
silver
from
her
shining
face
and
gales
sing
loudly
and
the
rain
from
eaveshoots
stream
with
bubbling
music
seek
my
soul
in
these
i
am
a
part
of
them
and
they
will
keep
perchance
the
music
which
i
wrought
with
tears
when
the
moon
shines
above
the
silent
trees
your
eyes
shall
see
me

of
brunhild
raises
memories
of
tragedy
of
her
rivalry
with
the
murderous
fredegonde
and
of
her
cruel
death
by
wild
horses
but
though
she
is
one
of
the
greatest
figures
in
early
french
history
she
has
never
been
celebrated
so
far
as
is
known
in
english
poetry
nor
has
she
received
the
honour
she
deserves
from
her
own
countrymen
in
this
poem
the
author
refrains
from
any
sensational
description

end

account
of
her
life

of
its
high
political
aims
in

of
a
high

which
is
worthy
of

romantic
