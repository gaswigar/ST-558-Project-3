lost
illusions
by
honore

preparer
note
the
trilogy
known
as
lost
illusions
consists
of
two
poets
a
distinguished
provincial
at
paris
eve
and
david
in
many
references
parts
one
and
three
are
combined
under
the
title
lost
illusions
and
a
distinguished
provincial
at
paris
is
given
its
individual
title
following
this
trilogy
is
a
sequel
scenes
from
a
courtesan
life
which
is
set
directly
following
the
end
of
eve
and
david
lost
illusions
introduction
the
longest
without
exception
of
balzac
books
and
one
which
contains
hardly
any
passage
that
is
not
very
nearly
of
his
best
suffers
i
think
a
little
in
point
of
composition
from
the
mixture
of
the
angouleme
scenes
of
its
first
and
third
parts
with
the
purely
parisian
interest
of
grand
homme
de
it
is
hardly
possible
to
exaggerate
the
gain
in
distinctness
and
lucidity
of
arrangement
derived
from
putting
deux
and
et
a
much
better
title
than
that
which
has
been
preferred
in
the
together
in
one
volume
and
reserving
the
greatness
and
decadence
of
lucien
de
rubempre
for
another
it
is
distinctly
awkward
that
this
should
be
divided
as
it
is
itself
an
enormous
episode
a
sort
of
herodotean
parenthesis
rather
than
an
integral
part
of
the
story
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
joins
on
much
more
to
the
et
miseres
des
than
to
its
actual
companions
in
fact
it
is
an
instance
of
the
somewhat
haphazard
and
arbitrary
way
in
which
the
actual
division
of
the
has
worked
that
it
should
dealing
as
it
does
wholly
and
solely
with
parisian
life
be
put
in
the
de
la
vie
de
and
should
be
separated
from
its
natural
conclusion
not
merely
as
a
matter
of
volumes
but
as
a
matter
of
divisions
in
making
the
arrangement
however
it
is
necessary
to
remember
balzac
own
scheme
especially
as
the
connection
of
the
three
parts
in
other
ways
is
too
close
to
permit
the
wrenching
of
them
asunder
altogether
and
finally
this
caution
given
all
that
is
necessary
can
be
done
by
devoting
the
first
part
of
the
introduction
entirely
to
the
first
and
third
or
angouleme
parts
and
by
consecrating
the
latter
part
to
the
egregious
lucien
by
himself
there
is
a
double
gain
in
doing
this
for
independently
of
the
connection
as
above
referred
to
lucien
has
little
to
do
except
as
an
opportunity
for
the
display
of
virtue
by
his
sister
and
david
sechard
and
the
parts
in
which
they
appear
are
among
the
most
interesting
of
balzac
work
the
idyllic
charm
of
this
marriage
for
love
combined
as
it
is
with
exhibitions
of
the
author
power
in
more
than
one
of
the
ways
in
which
he
loved
best
to
show
it
has
never
escaped
attention
from
balzac
most
competent
critics
he
himself
had
speculated
in
print
and
paper
before
david
sechard
was
conceived
he
himself
had
for
all
maniacs
all
men
of
one
idea
the
fraternal
enthusiasm
of
a
he
could
never
touch
a
miser
without
a
sort
of
shudder
of
interest
and
that
singular
fancy
of
his
for
describing
complicated
legal
and
commercial
undertakings
came
in
too
nor
did
he
spare
in
this
book
to
bring
in
other
favorite
matters
of
his
the
or
squireen
aristocracy
the
of
the
country
town
and
so
forth
the
result
is
a
book
of
multifarious
interest
not
hampered
as
some
of
its
fellows
are
by
an
uncertainty
on
the
author
part
as
to
what
particular
hare
he
is
coursing
part
of
the
interest
after
the
description
of
the
printing
office
and
of
old
sechard
swindling
of
his
son
is
a
doubling
it
is
true
upon
that
of
muse
du
and
is
perhaps
a
little
less
amusingly
done
but
it
is
blended
with
better
matters
sixte
du
chatelet
is
a
considerable
addition
to
balzac
gallery
of
the
aristocracy
in
transition
of
the
bonaparte
whom
perhaps
he
understood
even
better
than
the
old
nobility
for
they
were
already
in
his
time
becoming
adulterated
and
alloyed
or
than
the
new
folk
of
business
and
finance
for
they
were
but
in
their
earliest
stages
nor
is
the
rest
of
the
society
of
madame
de
bargeton
inferior
but
the
real
interest
both
of
deux
and
still
more
of
et
between
which
two
be
it
always
remembered
comes
in
the
lies
in
the
characters
who
gave
their
name
to
the
last
part
in
david
the
man
of
one
idea
who
yet
has
room
for
an
honest
love
and
an
friendship
balzac
could
not
go
wrong
david
sechard
takes
a
place
by
himself
among
the
sheep
of
the
some
may
indeed
say
that
this
phrase
is
unfortunate
that
balzac
sheep
have
more
qualities
of
the
mutton
than
innocence
it
is
not
quite
to
be
denied
but
david
is
very
far
indeed
from
being
a
good
imbecile
like
cesar
birotteau
or
a
man
intoxicated
out
of
by
a
passion
respectable
in
itself
like
goriot
his
sacrifice
of
his
mania
in
time
is
something
nay
it
is
very
much
and
his
disinterested
devotion
to
his
does
not
quite
pass
the
limits
of
sense
but
what
shall
we
say
of
eve
she
is
good
of
course
good
as
gold
as
eugenie
grandet
herself
and
the
novelist
has
been
kind
enough
to
allow
her
to
be
happier
but
has
he
quite
interested
us
in
her
love
for
david
has
he
even
persuaded
us
that
the
love
existed
in
a
form
deserving
the
name
did
not
eve
rather
take
her
husband
to
protect
him
to
look
after
him
than
either
to
love
honor
and
obey
in
the
orthodox
sense
or
to
love
for
love
sake
only
as
some
still
take
their
husbands
and
wives
even
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
this
is
a
question
which
each
reader
must
answer
for
himself
but
few
are
likely
to
refuse
assent
to
the
sentence
happy
the
husband
who
has
such
a
wife
as
eve
chardon
the
central
part
of
which
in
reason
stands
by
itself
and
may
do
so
ostensibly
with
considerably
less
than
the
introduction
explanatory
which
balzac
often
gives
to
his
own
books
is
one
of
the
most
carefully
worked
out
and
diversely
important
of
his
novels
it
should
of
course
be
read
before
et
miseres
des
which
is
avowedly
its
second
part
a
small
piece
of
et
serving
as
the
link
between
them
but
it
is
almost
sufficient
by
and
to
itself
de
rubempre
ou
le
would
be
the
most
straightforward
and
descriptive
title
for
it
and
one
which
balzac
in
some
of
his
moods
would
have
been
content
enough
to
use
the
story
of
it
is
too
continuous
and
interesting
to
need
elaborate
argument
for
nobody
is
likely
to
miss
any
important
link
in
it
but
balzac
has
nowhere
excelled
in
finesse
and
success
of
analysis
the
double
disillusion
which
introduces
itself
at
once
between
madame
de
bargeton
and
lucien
and
which
makes
any
of
a
valid
kind
impossible
because
each
can
not
but
be
aware
that
the
other
has
anticipated
the
rupture
it
will
not
perhaps
be
a
matter
of
such
general
agreement
whether
he
has
or
has
not
exceeded
the
fair
license
of
the
novelist
in
attributing
to
lucien
those
charms
of
body
and
gifts
of
mind
which
make
him
till
his
moral
weakness
and
worthlessness
are
exposed
irresistible
and
enable
him
for
a
time
to
repair
his
faults
by
a
sort
of
fairy
the
sonnets
of
which
were
given
to
the
author
by
poetical
friends
gautier
it
is
said
supplied
the
tulip
are
undoubtedly
good
and
sufficient
but
lucien
first
article
which
is
according
to
a
practice
the
rashness
of
which
can
not
be
too
much
deprecated
given
likewise
is
certainly
not
very
wonderful
and
the
paris
press
must
have
been
rather
at
a
low
ebb
if
it
made
any
sensation
as
we
are
not
favored
with
any
actual
portrait
of
lucien
detection
is
less
possible
here
but
the
novelist
has
perhaps
a
very
little
abused
the
privilege
of
making
a
hero
like
paris
handsome
and
like
hector
brave
or
rather
like
paris
handsome
and
like
phoebus
clever
there
is
no
doubt
however
that
the
interest
of
the
book
lies
partly
in
the
vivid
and
severe
picture
of
journalism
given
in
it
and
partly
in
the
way
in
which
the
character
of
lucien
is
adjusted
to
show
up
that
of
the
abstract
journalist
still
farther
how
far
is
the
picture
true
it
must
be
said
in
fairness
to
balzac
that
a
good
many
persons
of
some
competence
in
france
have
pronounced
for
its
truth
there
and
if
that
be
so
all
one
can
say
is
so
much
the
worse
for
french
journalists
it
is
also
certain
that
a
lesser
but
still
not
inconsiderable
number
of
persons
in
england
generally
persons
who
not
perhaps
with
balzac
genius
have
like
balzac
published
books
and
are
not
satisfied
with
their
reception
by
the
press
agree
more
or
less
as
to
england
for
myself
i
can
only
say
that
i
do
not
believe
things
have
ever
been
quite
so
bad
in
england
and
that
i
am
quite
sure
there
never
has
been
any
need
for
them
to
be
there
are
no
doubt
spiteful
unprincipled
incompetent
practitioners
of
journalism
as
of
everything
else
and
it
is
of
course
obvious
that
while
advertisements
the
favor
of
the
chiefs
of
parties
and
so
forth
are
temptations
to
newspaper
managers
not
to
hold
up
a
very
high
standard
of
honor
anonymity
affords
to
newspaper
writers
a
dangerously
easy
shield
to
cover
malice
or
dishonesty
but
i
can
only
say
that
during
long
practice
in
every
kind
of
political
and
literary
journalism
i
never
was
seriously
asked
to
write
anything
i
did
not
think
and
never
had
the
slightest
difficulty
in
confining
myself
to
what
i
did
think
in
fact
balzac
like
a
good
many
other
men
of
letters
who
abuse
journalism
put
himself
very
much
out
of
court
by
continually
practising
it
not
merely
during
his
struggling
period
but
long
after
he
had
made
his
name
indeed
almost
to
the
very
last
and
it
is
very
hard
to
resist
the
conclusion
that
when
he
charged
journalism
generally
not
merely
with
envy
hatred
malice
and
all
uncharitableness
but
with
hopeless
and
pervading
dishonesty
he
had
little
more
ground
for
it
than
an
inability
to
conceive
how
any
one
except
from
vile
reasons
of
this
kind
could
fail
to
praise
honore
de
balzac
at
any
rate
either
his
art
by
itself
or
his
art
assisted
and
strengthened
by
that
personal
feeling
which
as
we
have
seen
counted
for
much
with
him
has
here
produced
a
wonderfully
vivid
piece
of
fiction
one
i
think
inferior
in
success
to
hardly
anything
he
has
done
whether
as
at
a
late
period
a
very
and
critic
hinted
his
picture
of
the
luciens
and
the
lousteaus
did
not
a
little
to
propagate
both
is
another
matter
the
seriousness
with
which
balzac
took
the
accusation
perhaps
shows
a
little
sense
of
galling
but
putting
this
aside
grand
homme
de
province
a
must
be
ranked
both
for
comedy
and
tragedy
both
for
scheme
and
execution
in
the
first
rank
of
his
work
the
bibliography
of
this
long
and
curious
book
almost
the
only
one
which
contains
some
verse
some
of
balzac
own
some
given
to
him
by
his
more
poetical
friends
occupies
full
ten
pages
of
de
lovenjoul
record
the
first
part
which
bore
the
general
title
was
a
book
from
the
beginning
and
appeared
in
in
the
de
la
vie
de
it
had
five
chapters
and
the
original
verse
it
contained
had
appeared
in
the
ten
years
earlier
with
slight
variants
the
second
part
grand
homme
de
likewise
appeared
as
a
book
independently
published
by
souverain
in
in
two
volumes
and
forty
chapters
but
two
of
these
chapters
had
been
inserted
a
few
days
before
the
publications
in
the
here
canalis
was
more
distinctly
identified
with
lamartine
than
in
the
subsequent
texts
the
third
part
unlike
its
forerunners
appeared
serially
in
two
papers
and
in
the
year
under
the
title
of
sechard
ou
les
souffrances
and
next
year
became
a
book
under
the
first
title
only
but
before
this
last
issue
it
had
been
united
to
the
other
two
parts
and
had
appeared
as

was
your

journalists
in
the
time
of

that
they

spares
none
i
am
happy

this
opportunity
of
subscribing
myself
your
sincere
admirer
and
friend
de
balzac
two
poets
at
the
time
when
this
story
opens
the
stanhope
press
and
the
roller
were
not
as
yet
in
general
use
in
small
provincial
printing
establishments
even
at
angouleme
so
closely
connected
through
its
with
the
art
of
typography
in
paris
the
only
machinery
in
use
was
the
primitive
wooden
invention
to
which
the
language
owes
a
figure
of
speech
the
press
groans
was
no
mere
rhetorical
expression
in
those
days
leather
were
still
used
in
printing
houses
the
pressman
dabbed
the
ink
by
hand
on
the
characters
and
the
movable
table
on
which
the
form
of
type
was
placed
in
readiness
for
the
sheet
of
paper
being
made
of
marble
literally
deserved
its
name
of
modern
machinery
has
swept
all
this
mechanism
into
oblivion
the
wooden
press
which
with
all
its
imperfections
turned
out
such
beautiful
work
for
the
elzevirs
plantin
aldus
and
didot
is
so
completely
forgotten
that
something
must
be
said
as
to
the
obsolete
gear
on
which
sechard
set
an
almost
superstitious
affection
for
it
plays
a
part
in
this
chronicle
of
great
small
things
sechard
had
been
in
his
time
a
journeyman
pressman
a
bear
in
compositors
slang
the
continued
pacing
to
and
fro
of
the
pressman
from
to
press
from
press
to
no
doubt
suggested
the
nickname
the
bears
however
make
matters
even
by
calling
the
compositors
monkeys
on
account
of
the
nimble
industry
displayed
by
those
gentlemen
in
picking
out
the
type
from
the
hundred
and
compartments
of
the
cases
in
the
disastrous
year
sechard
being
fifty
years
old
and
a
married
man
escaped
the
great
requisition
which
swept
the
bulk
of
french
workmen
into
the
army
the
old
pressman
was
the
only
hand
left
in
the
and
when
the
master
otherwise
the
gaffer
died
leaving
a
widow
but
no
children
the
business
seemed
to
be
on
the
verge
of
extinction
for
the
solitary
bear
was
quite
incapable
of
the
feat
of
transformation
into
a
monkey
and
in
his
quality
of
pressman
had
never
learned
to
read
or
write
just
then
however
a
representative
of
the
people
being
in
a
mighty
hurry
to
publish
the
decrees
of
the
convention
bestowed
a
master
printer
license
on
sechard
and
requisitioned
the
establishment
citizen
sechard
accepted
the
dangerous
patent
bought
the
business
of
his
master
widow
with
his
wife
savings
and
took
over
the
plant
at
half
its
value
but
he
was
not
even
at
the
beginning
he
was
bound
to
print
the
decrees
of
the
republic
without
mistakes
and
without
delay
in
this
strait
sechard
had
the
luck
to
discover
a
noble
marseillais
who
had
no
mind
to
emigrate
and
lose
his
lands
nor
yet
to
show
himself
openly
and
lose
his
head
and
consequently
was
fain
to
earn
a
living
by
some
lawful
industry
a
bargain
was
struck
le
comte
de
maucombe
disguised
in
a
provincial
printer
jacket
set
up
read
and
corrected
the
decrees
which
forbade
citizens
to
harbor
aristocrats
under
pain
of
death
while
the
bear
now
a
gaffer
printed
the
copies
and
duly
posted
them
and
the
pair
remained
safe
and
sound
in
when
the
squall
of
the
terror
had
passed
over
nicolas
sechard
was
obliged
to
look
out
for
another
to
be
compositor
reader
and
foreman
in
one
and
an
abbe
who
declined
the
oath
succeeded
the
comte
de
maucombe
as
soon
as
the
first
consul
restored
public
worship
the
abbe
became
a
bishop
at
the
restoration
and
in
after
days
the
count
and
the
abbe
met
and
sat
together
on
the
same
bench
of
the
house
of
peers
in
had
not
known
how
to
read
or
write
in
he
had
made
no
progress
in
either
art
but
by
allowing
a
handsome
margin
for
wear
and
tear
in
his
estimates
he
managed
to
pay
a
wages
the
once
journeyman
was
a
terror
to
his
bears
and
monkeys
where
poverty
ceases
avarice
begins
from
the
day
when
sechard
first
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
possibility
of
making
a
fortune
a
growing
covetousness
developed
and
sharpened
in
him
a
certain
practical
faculty
for
business
greedy
suspicious
and
he
carried
on
his
craft
in
disdain
of
theory
in
course
of
time
he
had
learned
to
estimate
at
a
glance
the
cost
of
printing
per
page
or
per
sheet
in
every
kind
of
type
he
proved
to
unlettered
customers
that
large
type
costs
more
to
move
or
if
small
type
was
under
discussion
that
it
was
more
difficult
to
handle
the
of
the
type
was
the
one
part
of
his
craft
of
which
he
knew
nothing
and
so
great
was
his
terror
lest
he
should
not
charge
enough
that
he
always
made
a
heavy
profit
he
never
took
his
eyes
off
his
compositors
while
they
were
paid
by
the
hour
if
he
knew
that
a
paper
manufacturer
was
in
difficulties
he
would
buy
up
his
stock
at
a
cheap
rate
and
warehouse
the
paper
so
from
this
time
forward
he
was
his
own
landlord
and
owned
the
old
house
which
had
been
a
printing
office
from
time
immemorial
he
had
every
sort
of
luck
he
was
left
a
widower
with
but
one
son
the
boy
he
sent
to
the
grammar
school
he
must
be
educated
not
so
much
for
his
own
sake
as
to
train
a
successor
to
the
business
and
sechard
treated
the
lad
harshly
so
as
to
prolong
the
time
of
parental
rule
making
him
work
at
case
on
holidays
telling
him
that
he
must
learn
to
earn
his
own
living
so
as
to
recompense
his
poor
old
father
who
was
slaving
his
life
out
to
give
him
an
education
then
the
abbe
went
and
sechard
promoted
one
of
his
four
compositors
to
be
foreman
making
his
choice
on
the
future
bishop
recommendation
of
the
man
as
an
honest
and
intelligent
workman
in
these
ways
the
worthy
printer
thought
to
tide
over
the
time
until
his
son
could
take
a
business
which
was
sure
to
extend
in
young
and
clever
hands
david
sechard
school
career
was
a
brilliant
one
old
sechard
as
a
bear
who
had
succeeded
in
life
without
any
education
entertained
a
very
considerable
contempt
for
attainments
in
book
learning
and
when
he
sent
his
son
to
paris
to
study
the
higher
branches
of
typography
he
recommended
the
lad
so
earnestly
to
save
a
good
round
sum
in
the
working
man
paradise
as
he
was
pleased
to
call
the
city
and
so
distinctly
gave
the
boy
to
understand
that
he
was
not
to
draw
upon
the
paternal
purse
that
it
seemed
as
if
old
sechard
saw
some
way
of
gaining
private
ends
of
his
own
by
that
sojourn
in
the
land
of
sapience
so
david
learned
his
trade
and
completed
his
education
at
the
same
time
and
didot
foreman
became
a
scholar
and
yet
when
he
left
paris
at
the
end
of
summoned
home
by
his
father
to
take
the
helm
of
business
he
had
not
cost
his
parent
a
farthing
now
nicolas
sechard
establishment
hitherto
had
enjoyed
a
monopoly
of
all
the
official
printing
in
the
department
besides
the
work
of
the
prefecture
and
the
diocese
three
connections
which
should
prove
mighty
profitable
to
an
active
young
printer
but
precisely
at
this
juncture
the
firm
of
cointet
brothers
paper
manufacturers
applied
to
the
authorities
for
the
second
printer
license
in
angouleme
hitherto
old
sechard
had
contrived
to
reduce
this
license
to
a
dead
letter
thanks
to
the
war
crisis
of
the
empire
and
consequent
atrophy
of
commercial
enterprise
but
he
had
neglected
to
buy
up
the
right
himself
and
this
piece
of
parsimony
was
the
ruin
of
the
old
business
sechard
thought
joyfully
when
he
heard
the
news
that
the
coming
struggle
with
the
cointets
would
be
fought
out
by
his
son
and
not
by
himself
i
should
have
gone
to
the
wall
he
thought
but
a
young
fellow
from
the
didots
will
pull
through
the
septuagenarian
sighed
for
the
time
when
he
could
live
at
ease
in
his
own
fashion
if
his
knowledge
of
the
higher
branches
of
the
craft
of
printing
was
scanty
on
the
other
hand
he
was
supposed
to
be
past
master
of
an
art
which
workmen
pleasantly
call
an
art
held
in
high
esteem
by
the
divine
author
of
though
of
late
by
reason
of
the
persecution
of
societies
yclept
of
temperance
the
cult
has
fallen
day
by
day
into
disuse
sechard
bound
by
the
laws
of
etymology
to
be
a
dry
subject
suffered
from
an
inextinguishable
thirst
his
wife
during
her
lifetime
managed
to
control
within
reasonable
bounds
the
passion
for
the
juice
of
the
grape
a
taste
so
natural
to
the
bear
that
de
chateaubriand
remarked
it
among
the
ursine
tribes
of
the
new
world
but
philosophers
inform
us
that
old
age
is
apt
to
revert
to
the
habits
of
youth
and
sechard
senior
is
a
case
in
point
the
older
he
grew
the
better
he
loved
to
drink
the
had
given
a
stamp
of
originality
to
an
ursine
physiognomy
his
nose
had
developed
till
it
reached
the
proportions
of
a
double
a
his
veined
cheeks
looked
like
covered
as
they
were
with
bloated
patches
of
purple
madder
red
and
often
mottled
hues
till
altogether
the
countenance
suggested
a
huge
truffle
clasped
about
by
autumn
vine
tendrils
the
little
gray
eyes
peering
out
from
beneath
thick
eyebrows
like
bushes
covered
with
snow
were
agleam
with
the
cunning
of
avarice
that
had
extinguished
everything
else
in
the
man
down
to
the
very
instinct
of
fatherhood
those
eyes
never
lost
their
cunning
even
when
disguised
in
drink
sechard
put
you
in
mind
of
one
of
la
fontaine
franciscan
friars
with
the
fringe
of
grizzled
hair
still
curling
about
his
bald
pate
he
was
short
and
corpulent
like
one
of
the
lamps
for
illumination
that
burn
a
vast
deal
of
oil
to
a
very
small
piece
of
wick
for
excess
of
any
sort
confirms
the
habit
of
body
and
drunkenness
like
much
study
makes
the
fat
man
stouter
and
the
lean
man
leaner
still
for
thirty
years
had
worn
the
famous
municipal
hat
which
you
may
still
see
here
and
there
on
the
head
of
the
towncrier
in
places
his
breeches
and
waistcoat
were
of
greenish
velveteen
and
he
wore
an
brown
greatcoat
gray
cotton
stockings
and
shoes
with
silver
buckles
to
them
this
costume
in
which
the
workman
shone
through
the
burgess
was
so
thoroughly
in
keeping
with
the
man
character
defects
and
way
of
life
that
he
might
have
come
ready
dressed
into
the
world
you
could
no
more
imagine
him
apart
from
his
clothes
than
you
could
think
of
a
bulb
without
its
husk
if
the
old
printer
had
not
long
since
given
the
measure
of
his
blind
greed
the
very
nature
of
the
man
came
out
in
the
manner
of
his
abdication
knowing
as
he
did
that
his
son
must
have
learned
his
business
pretty
thoroughly
in
the
great
school
of
the
didots
he
had
yet
been
ruminating
for
a
long
while
over
the
bargain
that
he
meant
to
drive
with
david
all
that
the
father
made
the
son
of
course
was
bound
to
lose
but
in
business
this
worthy
knew
nothing
of
father
or
son
if
in
the
first
instance
he
had
looked
on
david
as
his
only
child
later
he
came
to
regard
him
as
the
natural
purchaser
of
the
business
whose
interests
were
therefore
his
own
sechard
meant
to
sell
dear
david
of
course
to
buy
cheap
his
son
therefore
was
an
antagonist
and
it
was
his
duty
to
get
the
better
of
him
the
transformation
of
sentiment
into
ordinarily
slow
tortuous
and
veiled
by
hypocrisy
in
better
educated
people
was
swift
and
direct
in
the
old
bear
who
demonstrated
the
superiority
of
shrewd
over
typography
david
came
home
and
the
old
man
received
him
with
all
the
cordiality
which
cunning
folk
can
assume
with
an
eye
to
business
he
was
as
full
of
thought
for
him
as
any
lover
for
his
mistress
giving
him
his
arm
telling
him
where
to
put
his
foot
down
so
as
to
avoid
the
mud
warming
the
bed
for
him
lighting
a
fire
in
his
room
making
his
supper
ready
the
next
day
after
he
had
done
his
best
to
fluster
his
son
wits
over
a
sumptuous
dinner
sechard
after
copious
potations
began
with
a
now
for
business
a
remark
so
singularly
misplaced
between
two
hiccoughs
that
david
begged
his
parent
to
postpone
serious
matters
until
the
morrow
but
the
old
bear
was
by
no
means
inclined
to
put
off
the
battle
he
was
too
well
prepared
to
turn
his
tipsiness
to
good
account
he
had
dragged
the
chain
these
fifty
years
he
would
not
wear
it
another
hour
his
son
should
be
the
gaffer
perhaps
a
word
or
two
about
the
business
premises
may
be
said
here
the
had
been
established
since
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
in
the
angle
made
by
the
rue
de
beaulieu
and
the
place
du
murier
it
had
been
devoted
to
its
present
purposes
for
a
long
time
past
the
ground
floor
consisted
of
a
single
huge
room
lighted
on
the
side
next
the
street
by
an
casement
and
by
a
large
sash
window
that
gave
upon
the
yard
at
the
back
a
passage
at
the
side
led
to
the
private
office
but
in
the
provinces
the
processes
of
typography
excite
such
a
lively
interest
that
customers
usually
preferred
to
enter
by
way
of
the
glass
door
in
the
street
front
though
they
at
once
descended
three
steps
for
the
floor
of
the
workshop
lay
below
the
level
of
the
street
the
gaping
newcomer
always
failed
to
note
the
perils
of
the
passage
through
the
shop
and
while
staring
at
the
sheets
of
paper
strung
in
groves
across
the
ceiling
ran
against
the
rows
of
cases
or
knocked
his
hat
against
the
that
secured
the
presses
in
position
or
the
customer
eyes
would
follow
the
agile
movements
of
a
compositor
picking
out
type
from
the
hundred
and
compartments
of
his
case
reading
his
copy
verifying
the
words
in
the
and
leading
the
lines
till
a
ream
of
damp
paper
weighted
with
heavy
slabs
and
set
down
in
the
middle
of
the
gangway
tripped
up
the
bemused
spectator
or
he
caught
his
hip
against
the
angle
of
a
bench
to
the
huge
delight
of
boys
bears
and
monkeys
no
wight
had
ever
been
known
to
reach
the
further
end
without
accident
a
couple
of
cages
had
been
built
out
into
the
yard
at
the
back
the
foreman
sat
in
state
in
the
one
the
master
printer
in
the
other
out
in
the
yard
the
walls
were
agreeably
decorated
by
trellised
vines
a
tempting
bit
of
color
considering
the
owner
reputation
on
the
one
side
of
the
space
stood
the
kitchen
on
the
other
the
woodshed
and
in
a
ramshackle
penthouse
against
the
hall
at
the
back
the
paper
was
trimmed
and
damped
down
here
too
the
forms
or
in
ordinary
language
the
masses
of
type
were
washed
inky
streams
issuing
thence
blended
with
the
ooze
from
the
kitchen
sink
and
found
their
way
into
the
kennel
in
the
street
outside
till
peasants
coming
into
the
town
of
a
market
day
believed
that
the
devil
was
taking
a
wash
inside
the
establishment
as
to
the
house
above
the
printing
office
it
consisted
of
three
rooms
on
the
first
floor
and
a
couple
of
attics
in
the
roof

first
room
did
duty
as
and
lobby
it
was
exactly
the
same
length
as
the
passage
below
less
the
space
taken
up
by
the
wooden
staircase
and
was
lighted
by
a
narrow
casement
on
the
street
and
a
window
looking
into
the
yard
the
chief
characteristic
of
the
apartment
was
a
cynic
simplicity
due
to
greed
the
bare
walls
were
covered
with
plain
whitewash
the
dirty
brick
floor
had
never
been
scoured
the
furniture
consisted
of
three
rickety
chairs
a
round
table
and
a
sideboard
stationed
between
the
two
doors
of
a
bedroom
and
a

and
doors
alike
were
dingy
with
accumulated
grime

of
blank

encumbered

more
frequently
than
not

bottles
and
plates
were
lying
about
on

the

was
lighted
on
the
side
of

by
a
window
with
leaded
panes

hung
with
the
tapestry

sabots
yes
sabots

he
opened
the
door
of
the
workshop
flew
to
the
nearest
press
artfully
oiled
and
cleaned
for
the
occasion
and
pointed
out
the
strong
oaken
cheeks
polished
up
by
the
apprentice
is
it
a
love
of
a
press
a
wedding
announcement
lay
in
the
press
the
old
bear
folded
down
the
frisket
upon
the
tympan
and
the
tympan
upon
the
form
ran
in
the
carriage
worked
the
lever
drew
out
the
carriage
and
lifted
the
frisket
and
tympan
all
with
as
much
agility
as
the
youngest
of
the
tribe
the
press
handled
in
this
sort
creaked
aloud
in
such
fine
style
that
you
might
have
thought
some
bird
had
dashed
itself
against
the
window
pane
and
flown
away
again
where
is
the
english
press
that
could
go
at
that
pace
the
parent
asked
of
his
astonished
son
old
sechard
hurried
to
the
second
and
then
to
the
third
in
order
repeating
the
manoeuvre
with
equal
dexterity
the
third
presenting
to
his
eye
a
patch
overlooked
by
the
apprentice
with
a
notable
oath
he
rubbed
it
with
the
skirt
of
his
overcoat
much
as
a
polishes
the
coat
of
an
animal
that
he
is
trying
to
sell
with
those
three
presses
david
you
can
make
your
nine
thousand
francs
a
year
without
a
foreman
as
your
future
partner
i
am
opposed
to
your
replacing
these
presses
by
your
cursed
machinery
that
wears
out
the
type
you
in
paris
have
been
making
such
a
over
that
damned
englishman
invention
a
foreigner
an
enemy
of
france
who
wants
to
help
the
ironfounders
to
a
fortune
oh
you
wanted
stanhopes
did
you
thanks
for
your
stanhopes
that
cost
two
thousand
five
hundred
francs
apiece
about
twice
as
much
as
my
three
jewels
put
together
and
maul
your
type
to
pieces
because
there
is
no
give
in
them
i
have
like
you
but
you
keep
this
well
in
mind
the
life
of
the
stanhope
is
the
death
of
the
type
those
three
presses
will
serve
your
turn
well
enough
the
printing
will
be
properly
done
and
folk
here
in
angouleme
wo
ask
any
more
of
you
you
may
print
with
presses
made
of
wood
or
iron
or
gold
or
silver
will
never
pay
you
a
farthing
more
pursued
david
thousand

vaflard
foundry
didot
apprentice
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
name
laugh
away
after
twelve
years
of
wear
that
type
is
as
good
as
new
that
is
what
i
call
a
typefounder
vaflard
is
an
honest
man
who
uses
hard
metal
and
to
my
way
of
thinking
the
best
typefounder
is
the
one
you
go
to
most
seldom
taken
at
ten
thousand
francs
continued
david
ten
thousand

father
why
that
is
two
francs
a
pound
and
the
didot
only
ask
sous
for
their
these

yours
will
only
fetch
the

of

you

masterpieces

bought
only
five
years
ago
some
of
them
are
as
bright
yet
as
when
they
came
from
the
foundry
look
here
old
sechard
pounced
upon
some
packets
of
unused
sorts
and
held
them
out
for
david
to
see
i
am
not
i
do
know
how
to
read
or
write
but
all
the
same
i
know
enough
to
see
that
gille
sloping
letters
are
the
fathers
of
your
didot
english
here
is
the
he
went
on
taking
up
an
unused
pica
type
david
saw
that
there
was
no
way
of
coming
to
terms
with
his
father
it
was
a
case
of
yes
or
no
of
taking
or
leaving
it
the
very
ropes
across
the
ceiling
had
gone
down
into
the
old
bear
inventory
and
not
the
smallest
item
was
omitted
jobbing
chases
and
had
all
been
put
down
and
valued
separately
with
miserly
exactitude
the
total
amounted
to
thirty
thousand
francs
including
the
license
and
the
goodwill
david
asked
himself
whether
or
not
this
thing
was
feasible
old
sechard
grew
uneasy
over
his
son
silence
he
would
rather
have
had
stormy
argument
than
a
wordless
acceptance
of
the
situation
chaffering
in
these
sorts
of
bargains
means
that
a
man
can
look
after
his
interests
a
man
who
is
ready
to
pay
you
anything
you
ask
will
pay
nothing
old
sechard
was
saying
to
himself
while
he
tried
to
follow
his
son
train
of
thought
he
went
through
the
list
of
odds
and
ends
of
plant
needed
by
a
country
business
drawing
david
now
to
a
now
to
a
bragging
of
its
usefulness
and
sound
condition
old
tools
are
always
the
best
tools
said
he
in
our
line
of
business
they
ought
to
fetch
more
than
the
new
like
tools
hideous
vignettes
representing
hymen
and
cupids
skeletons
raising
the
lids
of
their
tombs
to
describe
a
v
or
an
m
and
huge
borders
of
masks
for
theatrical
posters
became
in
turn
objects
of
tremendous
value
through
old
vinous
eloquence
old
custom
he
told
his
son
was
so
deeply
rooted
in
the
district
that
he
david
would
only
waste
his
pains
if
he
gave
them
the
finest
things
in
life
he
himself
had
tried
to
sell
them
a
better
class
of
almanac
than
the
on
grocers
paper
and
what
came
of
it
the
original
sold
better
than
the
most
sumptuous
calendars
david
would
soon
see
the
importance
of
these
things
when
he
found
he
could
get
more
for
them
than
for
the
most
costly
articles
aha
my
boy
paris
is
paris
and
the
provinces
are
the
provinces
if
a
man
came
in
from
with
an
order
for
wedding
cards
and
you
were
to
print
them
without
a
cupid
and
garlands
he
would
not
believe
that
he
was
properly
married
you
would
have
them
all
back
again
if
you
sent
them
out
with
a
plain
m
on
them
after
the
style
of
your
didot
they
may
be
fine
printers
but
their
inventions
take
in
the
provinces
for
another
hundred
years
so
there
you
are
a
generous
man
is
a
bad
david
nature
was
of
the
sensitive
and
affectionate
type
that
shrinks
from
a
dispute
and
gives
way
at
once
if
an
opponent
touches
his
feelings
his
loftiness
of
feeling
and
the
fact
that
the
old
toper
had
himself
well
in
hand
put
him
still
further
at
a
disadvantage
in
a
dispute
about
money
matters
with
his
own
father
especially
as
he
credited
that
father
with
the
best
intentions
and
took
his
covetous
greed
for
a
attachment
to
his
old
familiar
tools
still
as
sechard
had
taken
the
whole
place
over
from
rouzeau
widow
for
ten
thousand
francs
paid
in
assignats
it
stood
to
reason
that
thirty
thousand
francs
in
coin
at
the
present
day
was
an
exorbitant
demand
father
you
are
cutting
my
throat
exclaimed
david
cried
the
old
toper
raising
his
hand
to
the
lines
of
cord
across
the
ceiling
i
who
gave
you
life
why
david
what
do
you
suppose
the
license
is
worth
do
you
know
that
the
sheet
of
advertisements
alone
at
fivepence
a
line
brought
in
five
hundred
francs
last
month
you
turn
up
the
books
lad
and
see
what
we
make
by
placards
and
the
registers
at
the
prefecture
and
the
work
for
the
mayor
office
and
the
bishop
too
you
are
a
that
has
no
mind
to
get
on
you
are
haggling
over
the
horse
that
will
carry
you
to
some
pretty
bit
of
property
like
marsac
attached
to
the
valuation
of
plant
there
was
a
deed
of
partnership
between
sechard
senior
and
his
son
the
good
father
was
to
let
his
house
and
premises
to
the
new
firm
for
twelve
hundred
francs
per
annum
reserving
one
of
the
two
rooms
in
the
roof
for
himself
so
long
as
david
was
not
paid
in
full
the
profits
were
to
be
divided
equally
as
soon
as
he
paid
off
his
father
he
was
to
be
made
sole
proprietor
of
the
business
david
made
a
mental
calculation
of
the
value
of
the
license
the
goodwill
and
the
stock
of
paper
leaving
the
plant
out
of
account
it
was
just
possible
he
thought
to
clear
off
the
debt
he
accepted
the
conditions
old
sechard
accustomed
to
peasants
haggling
knowing
nothing
of
the
wider
business
views
of
paris
was
amazed
at
such
a
prompt
conclusion
can
he
have
been
putting
money
by
he
asked
himself
or
is
he
scheming
out
at
this
moment
some
way
of
not
paying
me
with
this
notion
in
his
head
he
tried
to
find
out
whether
david
had
any
money
with
him
he
wanted
to
be
paid
something
on
account
the
old
man
inquisitiveness
roused
his
son
distrust
david
remained
close
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
next
day
old
sechard
made
the
apprentice
move
all
his
own
household
stuff
up
into
the
attic
until
such
time
as
an
empty
market
cart
could
take
it
out
on
the
return
journey
into
the
country
and
david
entered
into
possession
of
three
bare
unfurnished
rooms
on
the
day
that
saw
him
installed
in
the
without
one
sou
wherewith
to
pay
his
men
wages
when
he
asked
his
father
as
a
partner
to
contribute
his
share
towards
the
working
expenses
the
old
man
pretended
not
to
understand
he
had
found
the
he
said
and
he
was
not
bound
to
find
the
money
too
he
had
paid
his
share
pressed
close
by
his
son
reasoning
he
answered
that
when
he
himself
had
paid
rouzeau
widow
he
had
not
had
a
penny
left
if
he
a
poor
ignorant
working
man
had
made
his
way
didot
apprentice
should
do
still
better
besides
had
not
david
been
earning
money
thanks
to
an
education
paid
for
by
the
sweat
of
his
old
father
brow
now
surely
was
the
time
when
the
education
would
come
in
useful
what
have
you
done
with
your
he
asked
returning
to
the
charge
he
meant
to
have
light
on
a
problem
which
his
son
left
unresolved
the
day
before
why
had
i
not
to
live
david
asked
indignantly
and
books
to
buy
besides
oh
you
bought
books
did
you
you
will
make
a
poor
man
of
business
a
man
that
buys
books
is
hardly
fit
to
print
them
retorted
the
bear
then
david
endured
the
most
painful
of
humiliations
the
sense
of
shame
for
a
parent
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
be
passive
while
his
father
poured
out
a
flood
of
reasons
sordid
whining
contemptible
reasons
in
which
the
niggardly
old
man
wrapped
his
refusal
david
crushed
down
his
pain
into
the
depths
of
his
soul
he
saw
that
he
was
alone
saw
that
he
had
no
one
to
look
to
but
himself
saw
too
that
his
father
was
trying
to
make
money
out
of
him
and
in
a
spirit
of
philosophical
curiosity
he
tried
to
find
out
how
far
the
old
man
would
go
he
called
old
sechard
attention
to
the
fact
that
he
had
never
as
yet
made
any
inquiry
as
to
his
fortune
if
that
fortune
would
not
buy
the
it
might
go
some
ways
towards
paying
the
working
expenses
your
mother
fortune
echoed
old
sechard
why
it
was
her
beauty
and
intelligence
david
understood
his
father
thoroughly
after
that
answer
he
understood
that
only
after
an
interminable
expensive
and
disgraceful
lawsuit
could
he
obtain
any
account
of
the
money
which
by
rights
was
his
the
noble
heart
accepted
the
heavy
burden
laid
upon
it
seeing
clearly
beforehand
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
free
himself
from
the
engagements
into
which
he
had
entered
with
his
father
i
will
work
he
said
to
himself
after
all
if
i
have
a
rough
time
of
it
so
had
the
old
man
besides
i
shall
be
working
for
myself
shall
i
not
i
am
leaving
you
a
treasure
said
sechard
uneasy
at
his
silence
david
asked
what
the
treasure
might
be
marion
said
his
father
marion
a
big
country
girl
was
an
indispensable
part
of
the
establishment
it
was
marion
who
damped
the
paper
and
cut
it
to
size
marion
did
the
cooking
washing
and
marketing
marion
unloaded
the
paper
carts
collected
accounts
and
cleaned
the
and
if
marion
had
but
known
how
to
read
old
sechard
would
have
put
her
to
set
up
type
into
the
bargain
old
sechard
set
out
on
foot
for
the
country
delighted
as
he
was
with
his
sale
of
the
business
he
was
not
quite
easy
in
his
mind
as
to
the
payment
to
the
throes
of
the
vendor
the
agony
of
uncertainty
as
to
the
completion
of
the
purchase
inevitably
succeeds
passion
of
every
sort
is
essentially
jesuitical
here
was
a
man
who
thought
that
education
was
useless
forcing
himself
to
believe
in
the
influence
of
education
he
was
mortgaging
thirty
thousand
francs
upon
the
ideas
of
honor
and
conduct
which
education
should
have
developed
in
his
son
david
had
received
a
good
training
so
david
would
sweat
blood
and
water
to
fulfil
his
engagements
david
knowledge
would
discover
new
resources
and
david
seemed
to
be
full
of
fine
feelings
so
david
would
pay
many
a
parent
does
in
this
way
and
thinks
that
he
has
acted
a
father
part
old
sechard
was
quite
of
that
opinion
by
the
time
that
he
had
reached
his
vineyard
at
marsac
a
hamlet
some
four
leagues
out
of
angouleme
the
previous
owner
had
built
a
nice
little
house
on
the
bit
of
property
and
from
year
to
year
had
added
other
bits
of
land
to
it
until
in
the
old
bear
bought
the
whole
and
went
thither
exchanging
the
toil
of
the
printing
press
for
the
labor
of
the
winepress
as
he
put
it
himself
he
had
been
in
that
line
so
long
that
he
ought
to
know
something
about
it
during
the
first
twelvemonth
of
rural
retirement
sechard
senior
showed
a
careful
countenance
among
his
vine
props
for
he
was
always
in
his
vineyard
now
just
as
in
the
old
days
he
had
lived
in
his
shop
day
in
day
out
the
prospect
of
thirty
thousand
francs
was
even
more
intoxicating
than
sweet
wine
already
in
imagination
he
fingered
the
coin
the
less
the
claim
to
the
money
the
more
eager
he
grew
to
pouch
it
not
seldom
his
anxieties
sent
him
hurrying
from
marsac
to
angouleme
he
would
climb
up
the
rocky
staircases
into
the
old
city
and
walk
into
his
son
workshop
to
see
how
business
went
there
stood
the
presses
in
their
places
the
one
apprentice
in
a
paper
cap
was
cleaning
the
there
was
a
creaking
of
a
press
over
the
printing
of
some
trade
circular
the
old
type
was
still
unchanged
and
in
the
dens
at
the
end
of
the
room
he
saw
his
son
and
the
foreman
reading
books
which
the
bear
took
for
then
he
would
join
david
at
dinner
and
go
back
to
marsac
chewing
the
cud
of
uneasy
reflection
avarice
like
love
has
the
gift
of
second
sight
instinctively
guessing
at
future
contingencies
and
hugging
its
presentiments
sechard
senior
living
at
a
distance
far
from
the
workshop
and
the
machinery
which
possessed
such
a
fascination
for
him
reminding
him
as
it
did
of
days
when
he
was
making
his
way
could
that
there
were
disquieting
symptoms
of
inactivity
in
his
son
the
name
of
cointet
brothers
haunted
him
like
a
dread
he
saw
sechard
son
dropping
into
the
second
place
in
short
the
old
man
scented
misfortune
in
the
wind
his
presentiments
were
too
well
founded
disaster
was
hovering
over
the
house
of
sechard
but
there
is
a
tutelary
deity
for
misers
and
by
a
chain
of
unforeseen
circumstances
that
tutelary
deity
was
so
ordering
matters
that
the
of
his
extortionate
bargain
was
to
be
tumbled
after
all
into
the
old
toper
pouch
indifferent
to
the
religious
reaction
brought
about
by
the
restoration
indifferent
no
less
to
the
liberal
movement
david
preserved
a
most
unlucky
neutrality
on
the
burning
questions
of
the
day
in
those
times
provincial
men
of
business
were
bound
to
profess
political
opinions
of
some
sort
if
they
meant
to
secure
custom
they
were
forced
to
choose
for
themselves
between
the
patronage
of
the
liberals
on
the
one
hand
or
the
royalists
on
the
other
and
love
moreover
had
come
to
david
heart
and
with
his
scientific
preoccupation
and
finer
nature
he
had
not
room
for
the
dogged
greed
of
which
our
successful
man
of
business
is
made
it
choked
the
keen
instinct
which
would
have
led
him
to
study
the
differences
between
the
paris
trade
and
the
business
of
a
provincial
the
shades
of
opinion
so
sharply
defined
in
the
country
are
blurred
and
lost
in
the
great
currents
of
parisian
business
life
cointet
brothers
set
themselves
deliberately
to
assimilate
all
shades
of
monarchical
opinion
they
let
every
one
know
that
they
fasted
of
a
friday
and
kept
lent
they
haunted
the
cathedral
they
cultivated
the
society
of
the
clergy
and
in
consequence
when
books
of
devotion
were
once
more
in
demand
cointet
brothers
were
the
first
in
this
lucrative
field
they
slandered
david
accusing
him
of
liberalism
atheism
and
what
not
how
asked
they
could
any
one
employ
a
man
whose
father
had
been
a
septembrist
a
bonapartist
and
a
drunkard
to
boot
the
old
man
was
sure
to
leave
plenty
of
gold
pieces
behind
him
they
themselves
were
poor
men
with
families
to
support
while
david
was
a
bachelor
and
could
do
as
he
pleased
he
would
have
plenty
one
of
these
days
he
could
afford
to
take
things
easily
whereas
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
such
tales
against
david
once
put
into
circulation
produced
their
effect
the
monopoly
of
the
prefectorial
and
diocesan
work
passed
gradually
into
the
hands
of
cointet
brothers
and
before
long
keen
competitors
emboldened
by
his
inaction
started
a
second
local
sheet
of
advertisements
and
announcements
the
older
establishment
was
left
at
length
with
the
orders
from
the
town
and
the
circulation
of
the
fell
off
by
meanwhile
the
cointets
grew
richer
they
had
made
handsome
profits
on
their
devotional
books
and
now
they
offered
to
buy
sechard
paper
to
have
all
the
trade
and
judicial
announcements
of
the
department
in
their
own
hands
the
news
of
this
proposal
sent
by
david
to
his
father
brought
the
old
vinegrower
from
marsac
into
the
place
du
murier
with
the
swiftness
of
the
raven
that
scents
the
corpses
on
a
battlefield
leave
me
to
manage
the
cointets
said
he
to
his
son
do
you
meddle
in
this
business
the
old
man
saw
what
the
cointets
meant
and
they
took
alarm
at
his
clearsighted
sagacity
his
son
was
making
a
blunder
he
said
and
he
sechard
had
come
to
put
a
stop
to
it
what
was
to
become
of
the
connection
if
david
gave
up
the
paper
it
all
depended
upon
the
paper
all
the
attorneys
and
solicitors
and
men
of
business
in
were
liberals
to
a
man
the
cointets
had
tried
to
ruin
the
sechards
by
accusing
them
of
liberalism
and
by
so
doing
gave
them
a
plank
to
cling
to
the
sechards
should
keep
the
liberal
business
sell
the
paper
indeed
why
you
might
as
well
sell
the
and
the
license
old
sechard
asked
the
cointets
sixty
thousand
francs
for
the
printing
business
so
as
not
to
ruin
his
son
he
was
fond
of
his
son
he
was
taking
his
son
part
the
vinegrower
brought
his
son
to
the
front
to
gain
his
point
as
a
peasant
brings
in
his
wife
his
son
was
unwilling
to
do
this
that
or
the
other
it
varied
according
to
the
offers
which
he
wrung
one
after
another
from
the
cointets
until
not
without
an
effort
he
drew
them
on
to
give
thousand
francs
for
the
but
at
the
same
time
david
must
pledge
himself
thenceforward
to
print
no
newspaper
whatsoever
under
a
penalty
of
thirty
thousand
francs
for
damages
that
transaction
dealt
the
deathblow
to
the
sechard
establishment
but
the
old
vinegrower
did
not
trouble
himself
much
on
that
head
murder
usually
follows
robbery
our
worthy
friend
intended
to
pay
himself
with
the
ready
money
to
have
the
cash
in
his
own
hands
he
would
have
given
in
david
himself
over
and
above
the
bargain
and
so
much
the
more
willingly
since
that
this
nuisance
of
a
son
could
claim
of
the
unexpected
windfall
taking
this
fact
into
consideration
therefore
the
generous
parent
consented
to
abandon
his
share
of
the
business
but
not
the
business
premises
and
the
rental
was
still
maintained
at
the
famous
sum
of
twelve
hundred
francs
per
annum
the
old
man
came
into
town
very
seldom
after
the
paper
was
sold
to
the
cointets
he
pleaded
his
advanced
age
but
the
truth
was
that
he
took
little
interest
in
the
establishment
now
that
it
was
his
no
longer
still
he
could
not
quite
shake
off
his
old
kindness
for
his
and
when
business
brought
him
into
angouleme
it
would
have
been
hard
to
say
which
was
the
stronger
attraction
to
the
old
house
his
wooden
presses
or
the
son
whom
as
a
matter
of
form
he
asked
for
rent
the
old
foreman
who
had
gone
over
to
the
rival
establishment
knew
exactly
how
much
this
fatherly
generosity
was
worth
the
old
fox
meant
to
reserve
a
right
to
interfere
in
his
son
affairs
and
had
taken
care
to
appear
in
the
bankruptcy
as
a
privileged
creditor
for
arrears
of
rent
the
causes
of
david
heedlessness
throw
a
light
on
the
character
of
that
young
man
only
a
few
days
after
his
establishment
in
the
paternal
printing
office
he
came
across
an
old
school
friend
in
the
direst
poverty
lucien
chardon
a
young
fellow
of
or
thereabouts
was
the
son
of
a
who
had
retired
with
a
wound
from
the
republican
army
nature
had
meant
chardon
senior
for
a
chemist
chance
opened
the
way
for
a
retail
druggist
business
in
angouleme
after
many
years
of
scientific
research
death
cut
him
off
in
the
midst
of
his
incompleted
experiments
and
the
great
discovery
that
should
have
brought
wealth
to
the
family
was
never
made
chardon
had
tried
to
find
a
specific
for
the
gout
gout
is
a
rich
malady
the
rich
will
pay
large
sums
to
recover
health
when
they
have
lost
it
and
for
this
reason
the
druggist
deliberately
selected
gout
as
his
problem
halfway
between
the
man
of
science
on
the
one
side
and
the
charlatan
on
the
other
he
saw
that
the
scientific
method
was
the
one
road
to
assured
success
and
had
studied
the
causes
of
the
complaint
and
based
his
remedy
on
a
certain
general
theory
of
treatment
with
modifications
in
practice
for
varying
temperaments
then
on
a
visit
to
paris
undertaken
to
solicit
the
approval
of
the
des
he
died
and
lost
all
the
fruits
of
his
labors
it
may
have
been
that
some
presentiment
of
the
end
had
led
the
country
druggist
to
do
all
that
in
him
lay
to
give
his
boy
and
girl
a
good
education
the
family
had
been
living
up
to
the
income
brought
in
by
the
business
and
now
when
they
were
left
almost
destitute
it
was
an
aggravation
of
their
misfortune
that
they
had
been
brought
up
in
the
expectations
of
a
brilliant
future
for
these
hopes
were
extinguished
by
their
father
death
the
great
desplein
who
attended
chardon
in
his
last
illness
saw
him
die
in
convulsions
of
rage
the
secret
of
the
army
surgeon
ambition
lay
in
his
passionate
love
for
his
wife
the
last
survivor
of
the
family
of
rubempre
saved
as
by
a
miracle
from
the
guillotine
in
he
had
gained
time
by
declaring
that
she
was
pregnant
a
lie
told
without
the
girl
knowledge
or
consent
then
when
in
a
manner
he
had
created
a
claim
to
call
her
his
wife
he
had
married
her
in
spite
of
their
common
poverty
the
children
of
this
marriage
like
all
children
of
love
inherited
the
mother
wonderful
beauty
that
gift
so
often
fatal
when
accompanied
by
poverty
the
life
of
hope
and
hard
work
and
despair
in
all
of
which
mme
chardon
had
shared
with
such
keen
sympathy
had
left
deep
traces
in
her
beautiful
face
just
as
the
slow
decline
of
a
scanty
income
had
changed
her
ways
and
habits
but
both
she
and
her
children
confronted
evil
days
bravely
enough
she
sold
the
druggist
shop
in
the
grand
rue
de
the
principal
suburb
of
angouleme
but
it
was
impossible
for
even
one
woman
to
exist
on
the
three
hundred
francs
of
income
brought
in
by
the
investment
of
the
so
the
mother
and
daughter
accepted
the
position
and
worked
to
earn
a
living
the
mother
went
out
as
a
monthly
nurse
and
for
her
gentle
manners
was
preferred
to
any
other
among
the
wealthy
houses
where
she
lived
without
expense
to
her
children
and
earned
some
seven
francs
a
week
to
save
her
son
the
embarrassment
of
seeing
his
mother
reduced
to
this
humble
position
she
assumed
the
name
of
madame
charlotte
and
persons
requiring
her
services
were
requested
to
apply
to
postel
chardon
successor
in
the
business
lucien
sister
worked
for
a
laundress
a
decent
woman
much
respected
in
and
earned
fifteen
daily
sous
as
mme
prieur
forewoman
she
had
a
certain
position
in
the
workroom
which
raised
her
slightly
above
the
class
of
the
two
women
slender
earnings
together
with
mme
chardon
three
hundred
francs
of
amounted
to
about
eight
hundred
francs
a
year
and
on
this
sum
three
persons
must
be
fed
clothed
and
lodged
yet
with
all
their
frugal
thrift
the
pittance
was
scarcely
sufficient
nearly
the
whole
of
it
was
needed
for
lucien
mme
chardon
and
her
daughter
eve
believed
in
lucien
as
mahomet
wife
believed
in
her
husband
their
devotion
for
his
future
knew
no
bounds
their
present
landlord
was
the
successor
to
the
business
for
postel
let
them
have
rooms
at
the
further
end
of
a
yard
at
the
back
of
the
laboratory
for
a
very
low
rent
and
lucien
slept
in
the
poor
garret
above
a
father
passion
for
natural
science
had
stimulated
the
boy
and
at
first
induced
him
to
follow
in
the
same
path
lucien
was
one
of
the
most
brilliant
pupils
at
the
grammar
school
of
angouleme
and
when
david
sechard
left
his
future
friend
was
in
the
third
form
when
chance
brought
the
together
again
lucien
was
weary
of
drinking
from
the
rude
cup
of
penury
and
ready
for
any
of
the
rash
decisive
steps
that
youth
takes
at
the
age
of
twenty
david
generous
offer
of
forty
francs
a
month
if
lucien
would
come
to
him
and
learn
the
work
of
a
printer
reader
came
in
time
david
had
no
need
whatever
of
a
printer
reader
but
he
saved
lucien
from
despair
the
ties
of
a
school
friendship
thus
renewed
were
soon
drawn
closer
than
ever
by
the
similarity
of
their
lot
in
life
and
the
dissimilarity
of
their
characters
both
felt
high
swelling
hopes
of
manifold
success
both
consciously
possessed
the
high
order
of
intelligence
which
sets
a
man
on
a
level
with
lofty
heights
consigned
though
they
were
socially
to
the
lowest
level
fate
injustice
was
a
strong
bond
between
them
and
then
by
different
ways
following
each
his
own
bent
of
mind
they
had
attained
to
poesy
lucien
destined
for
the
highest
speculative
fields
of
natural
science
was
aiming
with
hot
enthusiasm
at
fame
through
literature
while
david
with
that
meditative
temperament
which
inclines
to
poetry
was
drawn
by
his
tastes
towards
natural
science
the
exchange
of
roles
was
the
beginning
of
an
intellectual
comradeship
before
long
lucien
told
david
of
his
own
farsighted
views
of
the
application
of
science
to
manufacture
while
david
pointed
out
the
new
ways
in
literature
that
lucien
must
follow
if
he
meant
to
succeed
not
many
days
had
passed
before
the
young
men
friendship
became
a
passion
such
as
is
only
known
in
early
manhood
then
it
was
that
david
caught
a
glimpse
of
eve
fair
face
and
loved
as
grave
and
meditative
natures
can
love
the
nunc
et
semper
et
in
secula
of
the
liturgy
is
the
device
taken
by
many
a
sublime
unknown
poet
whose
works
consist
in
magnificent
epics
conceived
and
lost
between
heart
and
heart
with
a
lover
insight
david
read
the
secret
hopes
set
by
the
mother
and
sister
on
poet
brow
and
knowing
their
blind
devotion
it
was
very
sweet
to
him
to
draw
nearer
to
his
love
by
sharing
her
hopes
and
her
and
in
this
way
lucien
came
to
be
david
chosen
brother
as
there
are
ultras
who
would
fain
be
more
royalist
than
the
king
so
david
outdid
the
mother
and
sister
in
his
belief
in
genius
he
spoiled
lucien
as
a
mother
spoils
her
child
once
under
pressure
of
the
lack
of
money
which
tied
their
hands
the
two
were
ruminating
after
the
manner
of
young
men
over
ways
of
promptly
realizing
a
large
fortune
and
after
fruitless
shakings
of
all
the
trees
already
stripped
by
previous
comers
lucien
bethought
himself
of
two
of
his
father
ideas
chardon
had
talked
of
a
method
of
refining
sugar
by
a
chemical
process
which
would
reduce
the
cost
of
production
by
and
he
had
another
plan
for
employing
an
american
vegetable
fibre
for
making
paper
something
after
the
chinese
fashion
and
effecting
an
enormous
saving
in
the
cost
of
raw
material
david
knowing
the
importance
of
a
question
raised
already
by
the
didots
caught
at
this
latter
notion
saw
a
fortune
in
it
and
looked
upon
lucien
as
the
benefactor
whom
he
could
never
repay
any
one
may
guess
how
the
ruling
thoughts
and
inner
life
of
this
pair
of
friends
unfitted
them
for
carrying
on
the
business
of
a
printing
house
so
far
from
making
fifteen
to
twenty
thousand
francs
like
cointet
brothers
printers
and
publishers
to
the
diocese
and
proprietors
of
the
now
the
only
newspaper
in
the
department
sechard
son
made
a
bare
three
hundred
francs
per
month
out
of
which
the
foreman
salary
must
be
paid
as
well
as
wages
and
the
rent
and
taxes
so
that
david
himself
was
scarcely
making
twelve
hundred
francs
per
annum
active
and
industrious
men
of
business
would
have
bought
new
type
and
new
machinery
and
made
an
effort
to
secure
orders
for
cheap
printing
from
the
paris
book
trade
but
master
and
foreman
deep
in
absorbing
intellectual
interests
were
quite
content
with
such
orders
as
came
to
them
from
their
remaining
customers
in
the
long
length
the
cointets
had
come
to
understand
character
and
habits
they
did
not
slander
him
now
on
the
contrary
wise
policy
required
that
they
should
allow
the
business
to
flicker
on
it
was
to
their
interest
indeed
to
maintain
it
in
a
small
way
lest
it
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
some
more
formidable
competitor
they
made
a
practice
of
sending
prospectuses
and
circulars
as
it
is
called
to
the
sechard
establishment
so
it
came
about
that
all
unwittingly
david
owed
his
existence
commercially
speaking
to
the
cunning
schemes
of
his
competitors
the
cointets
well
pleased
with
his
craze
as
they
called
it
behaved
to
all
appearance
both
fairly
and
handsomely
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
adopting
the
tactics
of
the
owners
who
set
up
a
sham
opposition
coach
to
keep
rivals
out
of
the
field
inside
and
outside
the
condition
of
the
sechard
printing
establishment
bore
testimony
to
the
sordid
avarice
of
the
old
bear
who
never
spent
a
penny
on
repairs
the
old
house
had
stood
in
sun
and
rain
and
borne
the
brunt
of
the
weather
till
it
looked
like
some
venerable
tree
trunk
set
down
at
the
entrance
of
the
alley
so
riven
it
was
with
seams
and
cracks
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
the
house
front
built
of
brick
and
stone
with
no
pretensions
to
symmetry
seemed
to
be
bending
beneath
the
weight
of
a
roof
covered
with
the
curved
pantiles
in
common
use
in
the
south
of
france
the
decrepit
casements
were
fitted
with
the
heavy
unwieldy
shutters
necessary
in
that
climate
and
held
in
place
by
massive
iron
cross
bars
it
would
have
puzzled
you
to
find
a
more
dilapidated
house
in
angouleme
nothing
but
sheer
tenacity
of
mortar
kept
it
together
try
to
picture
the
workshop
lighted
at
either
end
and
dark
in
the
middle
the
walls
covered
with
handbills
and
begrimed
by
friction
of
all
the
workmen
who
had
rubbed
past
them
for
thirty
years
the
cobweb
of
cordage
across
the
ceiling
the
stacks
of
paper
the
presses
the
pile
of
slabs
for
weighting
the
damp
sheets
the
rows
of
cases
and
the
two
dens
in
the
far
corners
where
the
master
printer
and
foreman
sat
and
you
will
have
some
idea
of
the
life
led
by
the
two
friends
one
day
early
in
may
david
and
lucien
were
standing
together
by
the
window
that
looked
into
the
yard
it
was
nearly
two
and
the
four
or
five
men
were
going
out
to
dinner
david
waited
until
the
apprentice
had
shut
the
street
door
with
the
bell
fastened
to
it
then
he
drew
lucien
out
into
the
yard
as
if
the
smell
of
paper
ink
and
presses
and
old
woodwork
had
grown
intolerable
to
him
and
together
they
sat
down
under
the
vines
keeping
the
office
and
the
door
in
view
the
sunbeams
playing
among
the
trellised
hovered
over
the
two
poets
making
as
it
were
an
aureole
about
their
heads
bringing
the
contrast
between
their
faces
and
their
characters
into
a
vigorous
relief
that
would
have
tempted
the
brush
of
some
great
painter
david
physique
was
of
the
kind
that
nature
gives
to
the
fighter
the
man
born
to
struggle
in
obscurity
or
with
the
eyes
of
all
men
turned
upon
him
the
strong
shoulders
rising
above
the
broad
chest
were
in
keeping
with
the
full
development
of
his
whole
frame
with
his
thick
crop
of
black
hair
his
fleshy
swarthy
face
supported
by
a
thick
neck
he
looked
at
first
sight
like
one
of
canons
but
on
a
second
glance
there
was
that
in
the
lines
about
the
thick
lips
in
the
dimple
of
the
chin
in
the
turn
of
the
square
nostrils
with
the
broad
irregular
line
of
central
cleavage
and
above
all
in
the
eyes
with
the
steady
light
of
an
love
that
burned
in
them
which
revealed
the
real
character
of
the
man
the
wisdom
of
the
thinker
the
strenuous
melancholy
of
a
spirit
that
discerns
the
horizon
on
either
side
and
sees
clearly
to
the
end
of
winding
ways
turning
the
clear
light
of
analysis
upon
the
joys
of
fruition
known
as
yet
in
idea
alone
and
quick
to
turn
from
them
in
disgust
you
might
look
for
the
flash
of
genius
from
such
a
face
you
could
not
miss
the
ashes
of
the
volcano
hopes
extinguished
beneath
a
profound
sense
of
the
social
annihilation
to
which
lowly
birth
and
lack
of
fortune
condemns
so
many
a
loftier
mind
and
by
the
side
of
the
poor
printer
who
loathed
a
handicraft
so
closely
allied
to
intellectual
work
close
to
this
silenus
joyless
drinking
deep
draughts
from
the
cup
of
knowledge
and
of
poetry
that
he
might
forget
the
cares
of
his
narrow
lot
in
the
intoxication
of
soul
and
brain
stood
lucien
graceful
as
some
sculptured
indian
bacchus
for
in
lucien
face
there
was
the
distinction
of
line
which
stamps
the
beauty
of
the
antique
the
greek
profile
with
the
velvet
whiteness
of
women
faces
and
eyes
full
of
love
eyes
so
blue
that
they
looked
dark
against
a
pearly
setting
and
dewy
and
fresh
as
those
of
a
child
those
beautiful
eyes
looked
out
from
under
their
long
chestnut
lashes
beneath
eyebrows
that
might
have
been
traced
by
a
chinese
pencil
the
silken
down
on
his
cheeks
like
his
bright
curling
hair
shone
golden
in
the
sunlight
a
divine
graciousness
transfused
the
white
temples
that
caught
that
golden
gleam
a
matchless
nobleness
had
set
its
seal
in
the
short
chin
raised
but
not
abruptly
the
smile
that
hovered
about
the
coral
lips
yet
redder
as
they
seemed
by
force
of
contrast
with
the
even
teeth
was
the
smile
of
some
sorrowing
angel
lucien
hands
denoted
race
they
were
shapely
hands
hands
that
men
obey
at
a
sign
and
women
love
to
kiss
lucien
was
slender
and
of
middle
height
from
a
glance
at
his
feet
he
might
have
been
taken
for
a
girl
in
disguise
and
this
so
much
the
more
easily
from
the
feminine
contour
of
the
hips
a
characteristic
of
not
to
say
astute
men
this
is
a
trait
which
seldom
misleads
and
in
lucien
it
was
a
true
indication
of
character
for
when
he
analyzed
the
society
of
his
restless
mind
was
apt
to
take
its
stand
on
the
lower
ground
of
those
diplomatists
who
hold
that
success
justifies
the
use
of
any
means
however
base
it
is
one
of
the
misfortunes
attendant
upon
great
intellects
that
perforce
they
comprehend
all
things
both
good
and
evil
the
two
young
men
judged
society
by
the
more
lofty
standard
because
their
social
position
was
at
the
lowest
end
of
the
scale
for
unrecognized
power
is
apt
to
avenge
itself
for
lowly
station
by
viewing
the
world
from
a
lofty
standpoint
yet
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
they
grew
but
the
more
bitter
and
hopeless
after
these
swift
soaring
flights
to
the
upper
regions
of
thought
their
world
by
right
lucien
had
read
much
and
compared
david
had
thought
much
and
deeply
in
spite
of
the
young
printer
look
of
robust
health
his
turn
of
mind
was
melancholy
and
somewhat
morbid
he
lacked
confidence
in
himself
but
lucien
on
the
other
hand
with
a
boldness
little
to
be
expected
from
his
feminine
almost
effeminate
figure
graceful
though
it
was
lucien
possessed
the
gascon
temperament
to
the
highest
degree
rash
brave
and
adventurous
prone
to
make
the
most
of
the
bright
side
and
as
little
as
possible
of
the
dark
his
was
the
nature
that
sticks
at
no
crime
if
there
is
anything
to
be
gained
by
it
and
laughs
at
the
vice
which
serves
as
a
just
now
these
tendencies
of
ambition
were
held
in
check
partly
by
the
fair
illusions
of
youth
partly
by
the
enthusiasm
which
led
him
to
prefer
the
nobler
methods
which
every
man
in
love
with
glory
tries
first
of
all
lucien
was
struggling
as
yet
with
himself
and
his
own
desires
and
not
with
the
difficulties
of
life
at
strife
with
his
own
power
and
not
with
the
baseness
of
other
men
that
fatal
exemplar
for
impressionable
minds
the
brilliancy
of
his
intellect
had
a
keen
attraction
for
david
david
admired
his
friend
while
he
kept
him
out
of
the
scrapes
into
which
he
was
led
by
the
david
with
his
mind
and
timid
nature
at
variance
with
a
strong
constitution
was
by
no
means
wanting
in
the
persistence
of
the
northern
temper
and
if
he
saw
all
the
difficulties
before
him
none
the
less
he
vowed
to
himself
to
conquer
never
to
give
way
in
him
the
unswerving
virtue
of
an
apostle
was
softened
by
pity
that
sprang
from
inexhaustible
indulgence
in
the
friendship
grown
old
already
one
was
the
worshiper
and
that
one
was
david
lucien
ruled
him
like
a
woman
sure
of
love
and
david
loved
to
give
way
he
felt
that
his
physical
beauty
implied
a
real
superiority
which
he
accepted
looking
upon
himself
as
one
made
of
coarser
and
commoner
human
clay
the
ox
for
patient
labor
in
the
fields
the
free
life
for
the
bird
he
thought
to
himself
i
will
be
the
ox
and
lucien
shall
be
the
eagle
so
for
three
years
these
friends
had
mingled
the
destinies
bright
with
such
glorious
promise
together
they
read
the
great
works
that
appeared
above
the
horizon
of
literature
and
science
since
the
peace
the
poems
of
schiller
goethe
and
byron
the
prose
writings
of
scott
berzelius
davy
cuvier
lamartine
and
many
more
they
warmed
themselves
beside
these
great
hearthfires
they
tried
their
powers
in
abortive
creations
in
work
laid
aside
and
taken
up
again
with
new
glow
of
enthusiasm
incessantly
they
worked
with
the
unwearied
vitality
of
youth
comrades
in
poverty
comrades
in
the
consuming
love
of
art
and
science
till
they
forgot
the
hard
life
of
the
present
for
their
minds
were
wholly
bent
on
laying
the
foundations
of
future
fame
lucien
said
david
do
you
know
what
i
have
just
received
from
paris
he
drew
a
tiny
volume
from
his
pocket
listen
and
david
read
as
a
poet
can
read
first
andre
de
chenier
idyll
then
following
on
with
the
elegy
on
a
suicide
another
elegy
in
the
classic
taste
and
the
last
two
so
that
is
andre
de
chenier
lucien
exclaimed
again
and
again
it
fills
one
with
despair
he
cried
for
the
third
time
when
david
surrendered
the
book
to
him
unable
to
read
further
for
a
poet
rediscovered
by
a
poet
said
lucien
reading
the
signature
of
the
preface
after
chenier
had
written
those
poems
he
thought
that
he
had
written
nothing
worth
publishing
added
david
then
lucien
in
his
turn
read
aloud
the
fragment
of
an
epic
called
and
two
or
three
of
the
elegies
till
when
he
came
upon
the
line
if
they
know
not
bliss
is
there
happiness
on
earth
he
pressed
the
book
to
his
lips
and
tears
came
to
the
eyes
of
either
for
the
two
friends
were
lovers
and
the
were
changing
color
with
the
spring
covering
the
rifted
battered
walls
of
the
old
house
where
squalid
cracks
were
spreading
in
every
direction
with
fluted
columns
and
knots
and
and
uncounted
masterpieces
of
i
know
not
what
order
of
architecture
erected
by
fairy
hands
fancy
had
scattered
flowers
and
crimson
gems
over
the
gloomy
little
yard
and
chenier
became
for
david
the
eve
whom
he
worshiped
for
lucien
a
great
lady
to
whom
he
paid
his
homage
poetry
had
shaken
out
her
starry
robe
above
the
workshop
where
the
monkeys
and
bears
were
grotesquely
busy
among
types
and
presses
five
struck
but
the
friends
felt
neither
hunger
nor
thirst
life
had
turned
to
a
golden
dream
and
all
the
treasures
of
the
world
lay
at
their
feet
far
away
on
the
horizon
lay
the
blue
streak
to
which
hope
points
a
finger
in
storm
and
stress
and
a
siren
voice
sounded
in
their
ears
calling
come
spread
your
wings
through
that
streak
of
gold
or
silver
or
azure
lies
the
sure
way
of
escape
from
evil
fortune
just
at
that
moment
the
low
glass
door
of
the
workshop
was
opened
and
out
came
cerizet
an
apprentice
david
had
brought
the
urchin
from
paris
this
youth
introduced
a
stranger
who
saluted
the
friends
politely
and
spoke
to
david
this
sir
is
a
monograph
which
i
am
desirous
of
printing
said
he
drawing
a
huge
package
of
manuscript
from
his
pocket
will
you
oblige
me
with
an
estimate
we
do
not
undertake
work
on
such
a
scale
sir
david
answered
without
looking
at
the
manuscript
you
had
better
see
the
messieurs
cointet
about
it
still
we
have
a
very
pretty
type
which
might
suit
it
put
in
lucien
taking
up
the
roll
we
must
ask
you
to
be
kind
enough
sir
to
leave
your
commission
with
us
and
call
again
and
we
will
give
you
an
estimate
have
i
the
pleasure
of
addressing
lucien
chardon
yes
sir
said
the
foreman
i
am
fortunate
in
this
opportunity
of
meeting
with
a
young
poet
destined
to
such
greatness
returned
the
author
mme
de
bargeton
sent
me
here
lucien
flushed
red
at
the
name
and
stammered
out
something
about
gratitude
for
the
interest
which
mme
de
bargeton
took
in
him
david
noticed
his
friend
embarrassed
flush
and
left
him
in
conversation
with
the
country
gentleman
the
author
of
a
monograph
on
silkwork
cultivation
prompted
by
vanity
to
print
the
effort
for
the
benefit
of
of
the
local
agricultural
society
when
the
author
had
gone
david
spoke
lucien
are
you
in
love
with
mme
de
bargeton
passionately
but
social
prejudices
set
you
as
far
apart
as
if
she
were
living
at
pekin
and
you
in
greenland
the
will
of
two
lovers
can
rise
victorious
over
all
things
said
lucien
lowering
his
eyes
you
will
forget
us
returned
the
alarmed
lover
as
eve
fair
face
rose
before
his
mind
on
the
contrary
i
have
perhaps
sacrificed
my
love
to
you
cried
lucien
what
do
you
mean
in
spite
of
my
love
in
spite
of
the
different
motives
which
bid
me
obtain
a
secure
footing
in
her
house
i
have
told
her
that
i
will
never
go
thither
again
unless
another
is
made
welcome
too
a
man
whose
gifts
are
greater
than
mine
a
man
destined
for
a
brilliant
future
david
sechard
my
brother
my
friend
i
shall
find
an
answer
waiting
when
i
go
home
all
the
aristocrats
may
have
been
asked
to
hear
me
read
my
verses
this
evening
but
i
shall
not
go
if
the
answer
is
negative
and
i
will
never
set
foot
in
mme
de
bargeton
house
again
david
brushed
the
tears
from
his
eyes
and
wrung
lucien
hand
the
clock
struck
six
eve
must
be
anxious
lucien
added
abruptly
he
hurried
away
david
stood
overcome
by
the
emotion
that
is
only
felt
to
the
full
at
his
age
and
more
especially
in
such
a
position
as
his
the
friends
were
like
two
young
swans
with
wings
unclipped
as
yet
by
the
experiences
of
provincial
life
heart
of
gold
david
exclaimed
to
himself
as
his
eyes
followed
lucien
across
the
workshop
lucien
went
down
to
along
the
broad
promenade
de
beaulieu
the
rue
du
minage
and
gate
it
was
the
longest
way
round
so
you
may
be
sure
that
mme
de
bargeton
house
lay
on
the
way
so
delicious
it
was
to
pass
under
her
windows
though
she
knew
nothing
of
his
presence
that
for
the
past
two
months
he
had
gone
round
daily
by
the
palet
gate
into
under
the
trees
of
beaulieu
he
saw
how
far
the
suburb
lay
from
the
city
the
custom
of
the
country
moreover
had
raised
other
barriers
harder
to
surmount
than
the
mere
physical
difficulty
of
the
steep
flights
of
steps
which
lucien
was
descending
youth
and
ambition
had
thrown
the
of
glory
across
the
gulf
between
the
city
and
the
suburb
yet
lucien
was
as
uneasy
in
his
mind
over
his
answer
as
any
king
favorite
who
has
tried
to
climb
yet
higher
and
fears
that
being
he
is
like
to
fall
this
must
seem
a
dark
saying
to
those
who
have
never
studied
the
manners
and
customs
of
cities
divided
into
the
upper
and
lower
town
wherefore
it
is
necessary
to
enter
here
upon
some
topographical
details
and
this
so
much
the
more
if
the
reader
is
to
comprehend
the
position
of
one
of
the
principal
characters
in
the
story
mme
de
bargeton
the
old
city
of
angouleme
is
perched
aloft
on
a
crag
like
a
overlooking
the
plain
where
the
charente
winds
away
through
the
meadows
the
crag
is
an
outlying
spur
on
the
perigord
side
of
a
long
low
ridge
of
hill
which
terminates
abruptly
just
above
the
road
from
paris
to
bordeaux
so
that
the
rock
of
angouleme
is
a
sort
of
promontory
marking
out
the
line
of
three
picturesque
valleys
the
ramparts
and
great
gateways
and
ruined
fortress
on
the
summit
of
the
crag
still
remain
to
bear
witness
to
the
importance
of
this
stronghold
during
the
religious
wars
when
angouleme
was
a
military
position
coveted
alike
of
catholics
and
calvinists
but
its
strength
is
a
source
of
weakness
in
modern
days
angouleme
could
not
spread
down
to
the
charente
and
shut
in
between
its
ramparts
and
the
steep
sides
of
the
crag
the
old
town
is
condemned
to
stagnation
of
the
most
fatal
kind
the
government
made
an
attempt
about
this
very
time
to
extend
the
town
towards
perigord
building
a
prefecture
a
naval
school
and
barracks
along
the
hillside
and
opening
up
roads
but
private
enterprise
had
been
beforehand
elsewhere
for
some
time
past
the
suburb
of
had
sprung
up
a
mushroom
growth
at
the
foot
of
the
crag
and
along
the
where
the
direct
road
runs
from
paris
to
bordeaux
everybody
has
heard
of
the
great
of
angouleme
established
perforce
three
hundred
years
ago
on
the
charente
and
its
branch
streams
where
there
was
a
sufficient
fall
of
water
the
largest
state
factory
of
marine
ordnance
in
france
was
established
at
ruelle
some
six
miles
away
carriers
wheelwrights
posthouses
and
inns
every
agency
for
public
conveyance
every
industry
that
lives
by
road
or
river
was
crowded
together
in
lower
angouleme
to
avoid
the
difficulty
of
the
ascent
of
the
hill
naturally
too
tanneries
laundries
and
all
such
waterside
trades
stood
within
reach
of
the
charente
and
along
the
banks
of
the
river
lay
the
stores
of
brandy
and
great
warehouses
full
of
the
raw
material
all
the
carrying
trade
of
the
charente
in
short
had
lined
the
quays
with
buildings
so
the
faubourg
of
grew
into
a
busy
and
prosperous
city
a
second
angouleme
rivaling
the
upper
town
the
residence
of
the
powers
that
be
the
lords
spiritual
and
temporal
of
angouleme
though
with
all
its
business
and
increasing
greatness
was
still
a
mere
appendage
of
the
city
above
the
and
officialdom
dwelt
on
the
crag
trade
and
wealth
remained
below
no
love
was
lost
between
these
two
sections
of
the
community
all
the
world
over
and
in
angouleme
it
would
have
been
hard
to
say
which
of
the
two
camps
detested
the
other
the
more
cordially
under
the
empire
the
machinery
worked
fairly
smoothly
but
the
restoration
wrought
both
sides
to
the
highest
pitch
of
exasperation
nearly
every
house
in
the
upper
town
of
angouleme
is
inhabited
by
noble
or
at
any
rate
by
old
burgher
families
who
live
independently
on
their
incomes
a
sort
of
autochthonous
nation
who
suffer
no
aliens
to
come
among
them
possibly
after
two
hundred
years
of
unbroken
residence
and
it
may
be
an
intermarriage
or
two
with
one
of
the
primordial
houses
a
family
from
some
neighboring
district
may
be
adopted
but
in
the
eyes
of
the
aboriginal
race
they
are
still
newcomers
of
yesterday
prefects
and
various
administrations
that
have
come
and
gone
during
the
last
forty
years
have
tried
to
tame
the
ancient
families
perched
aloft
like
wary
ravens
on
their
crag
the
said
families
were
always
willing
to
accept
invitations
to
dinners
and
dances
but
as
to
admitting
the
strangers
to
their
own
houses
they
were
inexorable
ready
to
scoff
and
disparage
jealous
and
niggardly
marrying
only
among
themselves
the
families
formed
a
serried
phalanx
to
keep
out
intruders
of
modern
luxury
they
had
no
notion
and
as
for
sending
a
boy
to
paris
it
was
sending
him
they
thought
to
certain
ruin
such
sagacity
will
give
a
sufficient
idea
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
this
society
suffering
from
royalism
infected
with
bigotry
rather
than
zeal
all
stagnating
together
motionless
as
their
town
founded
upon
a
rock
yet
angouleme
enjoyed
a
great
reputation
in
the
provinces
round
about
for
its
educational
advantages
and
neighboring
towns
sent
their
daughters
to
its
boarding
schools
and
convents
it
is
easy
to
imagine
the
influence
of
the
class
sentiment
which
held
angouleme
aloof
from
the
merchant
classes
are
rich
the
are
usually
poor
each
side
takes
its
revenge
in
scorn
of
the
other
the
tradespeople
in
angouleme
espouse
the
quarrel
he
is
a
man
of
a
shopkeeper
of
the
upper
town
will
tell
you
speaking
of
a
merchant
in
the
lower
suburb
throwing
an
accent
into
the
speech
which
no
words
can
describe
when
the
restoration
defined
the
position
of
the
french
holding
out
hopes
to
them
which
could
only
be
realized
by
a
complete
and
general
the
distance
between
angouleme
and
already
more
strongly
marked
than
the
distance
between
the
hill
and
plain
was
widened
yet
further
the
better
families
all
devoted
as
one
man
to
the
government
grew
more
exclusive
here
than
in
any
other
part
of
france
the
man
of
became
little
better
than
a
pariah
hence
the
deep
smothered
hatred
which
broke
out
everywhere
with
such
ugly
unanimity
in
the
insurrection
of
and
destroyed
the
elements
of
a
durable
social
system
in
france
as
the
overweening
haughtiness
of
the
court
nobles
detached
the
provincial
from
the
throne
so
did
these
last
alienate
the
from
the
royal
cause
by
behavior
that
galled
their
vanity
in
every
possible
way
so
a
man
of
a
druggist
son
in
mme
de
bargeton
house
was
nothing
less
than
a
little
revolution
who
was

all
the

in

liberals

alike
must
divide
the
blame
among
them
mme

loved
art
and
letters
eccentric
taste
on
her
part
a
craze
deeply
deplored
in
angouleme
in
justice
to
the
lady
it
is
necessary
to
give
a
sketch
of
the
previous
history
of
a
woman
born
to
shine
and
left
by
unlucky
circumstances
in
the
shade
a
woman
whose
influence
decided
lucien
career
de
bargeton
was
the
of
an
alderman
of
bordeaux
named
mirault
ennobled
under
louis
xiii
for
long
tenure
of
office
his
son
bearing
the
name
of
mirault
de
bargeton
became
an
officer
in
the
household
troops
of
louis
and
married
so
great
a
fortune
that
in
the
reign
of
louis
xv
his
son
dropped
the
mirault
and
was
called
simply
de
bargeton
this
de
bargeton
the
alderman
grandson
lived
up
to
his
quality
so
strenuously
that
he
ran
through
the
family
property
and
checked
the
course
of
its
fortunes
two
of
his
brothers
indeed
of
the
present
bargeton
went
into
business
again
for
which
reason
you
will
find
the
name
of
mirault
among
bordeaux
merchants
at
this
day
the
lands
of
bargeton
in
angoumois
in
the
barony
of
rochefoucauld
being
entailed
and
the
house
in
angouleme
called
the
hotel
bargeton
likewise
the
grandson
of
de
bargeton
the
waster
came
in
for
these
hereditaments
though
the
year
deprived
him
of
all
seignorial
rights
save
to
the
rents
paid
by
his
tenants
which
amounted
to
some
ten
thousand
francs
per
annum
if
his
grandsire
had
but
walked
in
the
ways
of
his
illustrious
progenitors
bargeton
and
bargeton
bargeton
who
may
be
dubbed
bargeton
the
mute
by
way
of
distinction
should
by
rights
have
been
born
to
the
title
of
marquis
of
bargeton
he
would
have
been
connected
with
some
great
family
or
other
and
in
due
time
he
would
have
been
a
duke
and
a
peer
of
france
like
many
another
whereas
in
he
thought
himself
uncommonly
lucky
when
he
married
mlle
de
negrepelisse
the
daughter
of
a
noble
long
relegated
to
the
obscurity
of
his
scion
though
he
was
of
the
younger
branch
of
one
of
the
oldest
families
in
the
south
of
france
there
had
been
a
negrepelisse
among
the
hostages
of
louis

head
of
the
elder
branch
however
had
borne
the
illustrious
name
of
since
the
reign
of
henri
quatre
when
the
negrepelisse
of
that
day
married
an
heiress
of
the
family
as
for
de
negrepelisse
the
younger
son
of
a
younger
son
he
lived
upon
his
wife
property
a
small
estate
in
the
neighborhood
of
barbezieux
farming
the
land
to
admiration
selling
his
corn
in
the
market
himself
and
distilling
his
own
brandy
laughing
at
those
who
ridiculed
him
so
long
as
he
could
pile
up
silver
crowns
and
now
and
again
round
out
his
estate
with
another
bit
of
land
circumstances
unusual
enough
in
places
in
the
country
had
inspired
mme
de
bargeton
with
a
taste
for
music
and
reading
during
the
revolution
one
abbe
niollant
the
abbe
roze
best
pupil
found
a
in
the
old
of
escarbas
and
brought
with
him
his
baggage
of
musical
compositions
the
old
country
gentleman
hospitality
was
handsomely
repaid
for
the
abbe
undertook
his
daughter
education
anais
or
nais
as
she
was
called
must
otherwise
have
been
left
to
herself
or
worse
still
to
some
the
abbe
was
not
only
a
musician
he
was
well
and
widely
read
and
knew
both
italian
and
german
so
mlle
de
negrepelise
received
instruction
in
those
tongues
as
well
as
in
counterpoint
he
explained
the
great
masterpieces
of
the
french
german
and
italian
literatures
and
deciphered
with
her
the
music
of
the
great
composers
finally
as
time
hung
heavy
on
his
hands
in
the
seclusion
enforced
by
political
storms
he
taught
his
pupil
latin
and
greek
and
some
smatterings
of
natural
science
a
mother
might
have
modified
the
effects
of
a
man
education
upon
a
young
girl
whose
independent
spirit
had
been
fostered
in
the
first
place
by
a
country
life
the
abbe
niollant
an
enthusiast
and
a
poet
possessed
the
artistic
temperament
in
a
peculiarly
high
degree
a
temperament
compatible
with
many
estimable
qualities
but
prone
to
raise
itself
above
prejudices
by
the
liberty
of
its
judgments
and
breadth
of
view
in
society
an
intellect
of
this
order
wins
pardon
for
its
boldness
by
its
depth
and
originality
but
in
private
life
it
would
seem
to
do
positive
mischief
by
suggesting
wanderings
from
the
beaten
track
the
abbe
was
by
no
means
wanting
in
goodness
of
heart
and
his
ideas
were
therefore
the
more
contagious
for
this
girl
in
whom
they
were
confirmed
by
a
lonely
life
the
abbe
pupil
learned
to
be
fearless
in
criticism
and
ready
in
judgement
it
never
occurred
to
her
tutor
that
qualities
so
necessary
in
a
man
are
disadvantages
in
a
woman
destined
for
the
homely
life
of
a
and
though
the
abbe
constantly
impressed
it
upon
his
pupil
that
it
behoved
her
to
be
the
more
modest
and
gracious
with
the
extent
of
her
attainments
mlle
de
negrepelisse
conceived
an
excellent
opinion
of
herself
and
a
robust
contempt
for
ordinary
humanity
all
those
about
her
were
her
inferiors
or
persons
who
hastened
to
do
her
bidding
till
she
grew
to
be
as
haughty
as
a
great
lady
with
none
of
the
charming
blandness
and
urbanity
of
a
great
lady
the
instincts
of
vanity
were
flattered
by
the
pride
that
the
poor
abbe
took
in
his
pupil
the
pride
of
an
author
who
sees
himself
in
his
work
and
for
her
misfortune
she
met
no
one
with
whom
she
could
measure
herself
isolation
is
one
of
the
greatest
drawbacks
of
a
country
life
we
lose
the
habit
of
putting
ourselves
to
any
inconvenience
for
the
sake
of
others
when
there
is
no
one
for
whom
to
make
the
trifling
sacrifices
of
personal
effort
required
by
dress
and
manner
and
everything
in
us
shares
in
the
change
for
the
worse
the
form
and
the
spirit
deteriorate
together
with
no
social
intercourse
to
compel
mlle
de
negrepelisse
bold
ideas
passed
into
her
manner
and
the
expression
of
her
face
there
was
a
cavalier
air
about
her
a
something
that
seems
at
first
original
but
only
suited
to
women
of
adventurous
life
so
this
education
and
the
consequent
asperities
of
character
which
would
have
been
softened
down
in
a
higher
social
sphere
could
only
serve
to
make
her
ridiculous
at
angouleme
so
soon
as
her
adorers
should
cease
to
worship
eccentricities
that
charm
only
in
youth
as
for
de
negrepelisse
he
would
have
given
all
his
books
to
save
the
life
of
a
sick
bullock
and
so
miserly
was
he
that
he
would
not
have
given
her
two
farthings
over
and
above
the
allowance
to
which
she
had
a
right
even
if
it
had
been
a
question
of
some
indispensable
trifle
for
her
education
in

before
the
marriage
of
his
dear
child
a
marriage
which
he
doubtless
would
never
have
advised
the
old
father
found
his
daughter
a
great
care
now
that
the
abbe
was
gone
the
girl
with
nothing
else
to
do
was
sure
to
break
into
rebellion
against
his
niggardliness
and
he
felt
quite
unequal
to
the
struggle
like
all
young
women
who
leave
the
appointed
track
of
woman
life
nais
had
her
own
opinions
about
marriage
and
had
no
great
inclination
thereto
she
shrank
from
submitting
herself
body
and
soul
to
the
feeble
undignified
specimens
of
mankind
whom
she
had
chanced
to
meet
she
wished
to
rule
marriage
meant
obedience
and
between
obedience
to
coarse
caprices
and
a
mind
without
indulgence
for
her
tastes
and
flight
with
a
lover
who
should
please
her
she
would
not
have
hesitated
for
a
moment
de
negrepelisse
maintained
sufficient
of
the
tradition
of
birth
to
dread
a
like
many
another
parent
he
resolved
to
marry
his
daughter
not
so
much
on
her
account
as
for
his
own
peace
of
mind
a
noble
or
a
country
gentleman
was
the
man
for
him
somebody
not
too
clever
incapable
of
haggling
over
the
account
of
the
trust
stupid
enough
and
easy
enough
to
allow
nais
to
have
her
own
way
and
disinterested
enough
to
take
her
without
a
dowry
but
where
to
look
for
a
to
suit
father
and
daughter
equally
well
was
the
problem
such
a
man
would
be
the
phoenix
of
to
de
negrepelisse
pondering
over
the
eligible
bachelors
of
the
province
with
these
double
requirements
in
his
mind
de
bargeton
seemed
to
be
the
only
one
who
answered
to
this
description
de
bargeton
aged
forty
considerably
shattered
by
the
amorous
dissipations
of
his
youth
was
generally
held
to
be
a
man
of
remarkably
feeble
intellect
but
he
had
just
the
exact
amount
of
commonsense
required
for
the
management
of
his
fortune
and
breeding
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
avoid
blunders
or
blatant
follies
in
society
in
angouleme
in
the
bluntest
manner
de
negrepelisse
pointed
out
the
negative
virtues
of
the
model
husband
designed
for
his
daughter
and
made
her
see
the
way
to
manage
him
so
as
to
secure
her
own
happiness
so
nais

would
obtain
for

nais
was
enchanted
by
the
prospect
of
such
liberty
de
bargeton
was
of
the
opinion
that
he
was
making
a
brilliant
marriage
for
he
expected
that
in
no
long
while
de
negrepelisse
would
leave
him
the
estates
which
he
was
rounding
out
so
lovingly
but
to
an
unprejudiced
spectator
it
certainly
seemed
as
though
the
duty
of
writing
the
bridegroom
epitaph
might
devolve
upon
his
by
this
time
mme
de
bargeton
was
years
old
and
her
husband
the
disparity
in
age
was
the
more
startling
since
de
bargeton
looked
like
a
man
of
seventy
whereas
his
wife
looked
scarcely
half
her
age
she
could
still
wear
and
her
hair
hanging
loose
upon
her
shoulders
although
their
income
did
not
exceed
twelve
thousand
francs
they
ranked
among
the
largest
fortunes
in
the
old
city

and
officials

mme

were
obliged
to
live
in

until
such
time
as
mme
de

inheritance
should
fall
in
and
they
could
go
to
paris
meanwhile
they
were
bound
to
be
attentive
to
old
de
negrepelisse
who
kept
them
waiting
so
long
that
his
in
fact
predeceased
him
and

gifts
and
the
wealth
that
lay

inspiring
the
devotion
hidden
from
all
eyes
and
glowing
out
upon
the
world
in
verse
turns
to
exaggeration
with
the
trifles
of
a
narrow
existence
for
its
object
far
away
from
the
centres
of
light
shed
by
great
minds
where
the
air
is
quick
with
thought
knowledge
stands
still
taste
is
corrupted
like
stagnant
water
and
passion
dwindles
frittered
away
upon
the
infinitely
small
objects
which
it
strives
to
exalt
herein
lies
the
secret
of
the
avarice
and
that
poison
provincial
life
the
contagion
of
and
meanness
affects
the
noblest
natures
and
in
such
ways
as
these
men
born
to
be
great
and
women
who
would
have
been
charming
if
they
had
fallen
under

balked
of
their
lives
here
was
mme
de
bargeton
for
instance
smiting
the
lyre
for
every
trifle
and
publishing
her
emotions
indiscriminately
to
her
circle
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
sensations
appeal
to
an
audience
of
one
it
is
better
to
keep
them
to
ourselves
a

certainly
is
a
glorious
poem
but
if
a
woman
describes
it
in
words
for
the
benefit
of
people
is
she
not
ridiculous
there
are
pleasures
which
can
only
be
felt
to
the
full
when
two
souls
meet
poet
and
poet
heart
and
heart
she
had
a
trick
of
using
phrases
interlarded
with
exaggerated
expressions
the
kind
of
stuff
ingeniously
nicknamed
by
the
french
journalist
who
furnishes
a
daily
supply
of
the
commodity
for
a
public
that
daily
performs
the
difficult
feat
of
swallowing
it
she
squandered
superlatives
recklessly
in
her
talk
and
the
smallest
things
took
giant
proportions
it
was
at
this
period
of
her
career
that
she
began
to
individualize
synthesize
dramatize
superiorize
analyze
poetize
angelize
neologize
tragedify
prosify
and
colossify
you
must
violate
the
laws
of
language
to
find
words
to
express
the
whimsies
in
which
even
women
here
and
there
indulge
the
heat
of
her
language
communicated
itself
to
the
brain
and
the
dithyrambs
on
her
lips
were
spoken
out
of
the
abundance
of
her
heart
she
palpitated
swooned
and
went
into
ecstasies
over
anything
and
everything
over
the
devotion
of
a
sister
of
charity
and
the
execution
of
the
brothers
fauchet
over
lewis
or
the
escape
of
la
valette
or
the
presence
of
mind
of
a
lady
friend
who
put
burglars
to
flight
by
imitating
a
voice
everything
was
heroic
extraordinary
strange
wonderful
and
divine
she
would
work
herself
into
a
state
of
excitement
indignation
or
depression
she
soared
to
heaven
and
sank
again
gazed
at
the
sky
or
looked
to
earth
her
eyes
were
always
filled
with
tears
she
wore
herself
out
with
chronic
admiration
and
wasted
her
strength
on
curious
dislikes
her
mind
ran
on
the
pasha
of
janina
she
would
have
liked
to
try
conclusions
with
him
in
his
seraglio
and
had
a
great
notion
of
being
sewn
in
a
sack
and
thrown
into
the
water
she
envied
that
of
the
desert
lady

stanhope
she
longed
to
be
a
sister
of
saint
camilla
and
tend
the
sick
and
die
of
yellow
fever
in
a
hospital
at
barcelona
was
a
high
a
noble
destiny
in
short
she
thirsted
for
any
draught
but
the
clear
spring
water
of
her
own
life
flowing
hidden
among
green
pastures
she
adored
byron
and
rousseau
or
anybody
else
with
a
picturesque
or
dramatic
career
her
tears
were
ready
to
flow
for
every
misfortune
she
sang
paeans
for
every
victory
she
sympathized
with
the
fallen
napoleon
and
with
mehemet
ali
massacring
the
foreign
usurpers
of
egypt
in
short
any
kind
of
genius
was
accommodated
with
an
aureole
and
she
was
fully
persuaded
that
gifted
immortals
lived
on
incense
and
light
a
good
many
people
looked
upon
her
as
a
harmless
lunatic
but
in
these
extravagances
of
hers
a
keener
observer
surely
would
have
seen
the
broken
fragments
of
a
magnificent
edifice
that
had
crumbled
into
ruin
before
it
was
completed
the
stones
of
a
heavenly
jerusalem
love
in
short
without
a
lover
and
this
was
indeed
the
fact
the
story
of
the
first
eighteen
years
of
mme
de
bargeton
married
life
can
be
summed
up
in
a
few
words
for
a
long
while
she
lived
upon
herself
and
distant
hopes
then
when
she
began
to
see
that
their
narrow
income
put
the
life
in
paris
quite
out
of
the
question
she
looked
about
her
at
the
people
with
whom
her
life
must
be
spent
and
shuddered
at
her
loneliness
there
was
not
a
single
man
who
could
inspire
the
madness
to
which
women
are
prone
when
they
despair
of
a
life
become
stale
and
unprofitable
in
the
present
and
with
no
outlook
for
the
future
she
had
nothing
to
look
for
nothing
to
expect
from
chance
for
there
are
lives
in
which
chance
plays
no
part
but
when
the
empire
was
in
the
full
noonday
of
glory
and
napoleon
was
sending
the
flower
of
his
troops
to
the
peninsula
her
disappointed
hopes
revived
natural
curiosity
prompted
her
to
make
an
effort
to
see
the
heroes
who
were
conquering
europe
in
obedience
to
a
word
from
the
emperor
in
the
order
of
the
day
the
heroes
of
a
modern
time
who
outdid
the
mythical
feats
of
paladins
of
old
the
cities
of
france
however
avaricious
or
refractory
must
perforce
do
honor
to
the
imperial
guard
and
mayors
and
prefects
went
out
to
meet
them
with
set
speeches
as
if
the
conquerors
had
been
crowned
kings
mme
de
bargeton
went
to
a
given
to
the
town
by
a
regiment
and
fell
in
love
with
an
officer
of
a
good
family
a
to
whom
the
crafty
napoleon
had
given
a
glimpse
of
the
baton
of
a
marshal
of
france
love
restrained
greater
and
nobler
than
the
ties
that
were
made
and
unmade
so
easily
in
those
days
was
consecrated
coldly
by
the
hands
of
death
on
the
battlefield
of
wagram
a
shell
shattered
the
only
record
of
mme
de
bargeton
young
beauty
a
portrait
worn
on
the
heart
of
the
marquis
of
for
long
afterwards
she
wept
for
the
young
soldier
the
colonel
in
his
second
campaign
for
the
heart
hot
with
love
and
glory
that
set
a
letter
from
nais
above
imperial
favor
the
pain
of
those
days
cast
a
veil
of
sadness
over
her
face
a
shadow
that
only
vanished
at
the
terrible
age
when
a
woman
first
discovers
with
dismay
that
the
best
years
of
her
life
are
over
and
she
has
had
no
joy
of
them
when
she
sees
her
roses
wither
and
the
longing
for
love
is
revived
again
with
the
desire
to
linger
yet
for
a
little
on
the
last
smiles
of
youth
her
nobler
qualities
dealt
so
many
wounds
to
her
soul
at
the
moment
when
the
cold
of
the
provinces
seized
upon
her
she
would
have
died
of
grief
like
the
ermine
if
by
chance
she
had
been
sullied
by
contact
with
those
men
whose
thoughts
are
bent
on
winning
a
few
sous
nightly
at
cards
after
a
good
dinner
pride
saved
her
from
the
shabby
love
intrigues
of
the
provinces
a
woman
so
much
above
the
level
of
those
about
her
forced
to
decide
between
the
emptiness
of
the
men
whom
she
meets
and
the
emptiness
of
her
own
life
can
make
but
one
choice
marriage
and
society
became
a
cloister
for
anais
she
lived
by
poetry
as
the
carmelite
lives
by
religion
all
the
famous
foreign
books
published
in
france
for
the
first
time
between
and
the
great
essayists

and
de
maistre
those
two
eagles
of
thought
all
the
lighter
french
literature
in
short
that
appeared
during
that
sudden
outburst
of
first
vigorous
growth
might
bring
delight
into
her
solitary
life
but
not
flexibility
of
mind
or
body
she
stood
strong
and
straight
like
some
forest
tree
but
still
erect
her
dignity
became
a
stilted
manner
her
social
supremacy
led
her
into
affectation
and
sentimental
she
queened
it
with
her
foibles
after
the
usual
fashion
of
those
who
allow
their
courtiers
to
adore
them
this
was
mme
de

past
life
a
dreary
chronicle
which
must
be
given
if

position
with
regard
to
the
lady
is
to
be
comprehensible
lucien
introduction
came
about
oddly
enough
in
the
previous
winter
a
newcomer
had
brought
some
interest
into
mme
de
bargeton
monotonous
life
the
place
of
controller
of
excise
fell
vacant
and
de
barante
appointed
a
man
whose
adventurous
life
was
a
sufficient
passport
to
the
house
of
the
sovereign
lady
who
had
her
share
of
feminine
curiosity
de
chatelet
he
began
life
as
plain
sixte
chatelet
but
since
had
the
wit
to
adopt
the
particle
du
chatelet
was
one
of
the
agreeable
young
men
who
escaped
conscription
after
conscription
by
keeping
very
close
to
the
imperial
sun
he
had
begun
his
career
as
private
secretary
to
an
imperial
highness
a
post
for
which
he
possessed
every
qualification
personable
and
of
a
good
figure
a
clever
a
passable
amateur
actor
he
danced
well
and
excelled
in
most
physical
exercises
he
could
moreover
sing
a
ballad
and
applaud
a
witticism
supple
envious
never
at
a
loss
there
was
nothing
that
he
did
not
know
nothing
that
he
really
knew
he
knew
nothing
for
instance
of
music
but
he
could
sit
down
to
the
piano
and
accompany
after
a
fashion
a
woman
who
consented
after
much
pressing
to
sing
a
ballad
learned
by
heart
in
a
month
of
hard
practice
incapable
though
he
was
of
any
feeling
for
poetry
he
would
boldly
ask
permission
to
retire
for
ten
minutes
to
compose
an
impromptu
and
return
with
a
quatrain
flat
as
a
pancake
wherein
rhyme
did
duty
for
reason
du
chatelet
had
besides
a
very
pretty
talent
for
filling
in
the
ground
of
the
princess
worsted
work
after
the
flowers
had
been
begun
he
held
her
skeins
of
silk
with
infinite
grace
entertained
her
with
dubious
nothings
more
or
less
transparently
veiled
he
was
ignorant
of
painting
but
he
could
copy
a
landscape
sketch
a
head
in
profile
or
design
a
costume
and
color
it
he
had
in
short
all
the
little
talents
that
a
man
could
turn
to
such
useful
account
in
times
when
women
exercised
more
influence
in
public
life
than
most
people
imagine
diplomacy
he
claimed
to
be
his
strong
point
it
usually
is
with
those
who
have
no
knowledge
and
are
profound
by
reason
of
their
emptiness
and
indeed
this
kind
of
skill
possesses
one
signal
advantage
for
it
can
only
be
displayed
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs
of
the
great
and
when
discretion
is
the
quality
required
a
man
who
knows
nothing
can
safely
say
nothing
and
take
refuge
in
a
mysterious
shake
of
the
head
in
fact
the
cleverest
practitioner
is
he
who
can
swim
with
the
current
and
keep
his
head
well
above
the
stream
of
events
which
he
appears
to
control
a
fitness
for
this
business
varying
inversely
as
his
specific
gravity
but
in
this
particular
art
or
craft
as
in
all
others
you
shall
find
a
thousand
mediocrities
for
one
man
of
genius
and
in
spite
of
chatelet
services
ordinary
and
extraordinary
her
imperial
highness
could
not
procure
a
seat
in
the
privy
council
for
her
private
secretary
not
that
he
would
not
have
made
a
delightful
master
of
requests
like
many
another
but
the
princess
was
of
the
opinion
that
her
secretary
was
better
placed
with
her
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
he
was
made
a
baron
however
and
went
to
cassel
as
no
empty
form
of
words
for
he
cut
a
very
extraordinary
figure
there
napoleon
used
him
as
a
diplomatic
courier
in
the
thick
of
a
european
crisis
just
as
he
had
been
promised
the
post
of
minister
to
jerome
in
westphalia
the
empire
fell
to
pieces
and
balked
of
his
de
as
he
called
it
he
went
off
in
despair
to
egypt
with
general
de
montriveau
a
strange
chapter
of
accidents
separated
him
from
his
traveling
companion
and
for
two
long
years
sixte
du
chatelet
led
a
wandering
life
among
the
arab
tribes
of
the
desert
who
sold
and
resold
their
captive
his
talents
being
not
of
the
slightest
use
to
the
nomad
tribes
at
length
about
the
time
that
montriveau
reached
tangier
chatelet
found
himself
in
the
territory
of
the
imam
of
muscat
had
the
luck
to
find
an
english
vessel
just
about
to
set
sail
and
so
came
back
to
paris
a
year
sooner
than
his
sometime
companion
once
in
paris
his
recent
misfortunes
and
certain
connections
of
long
standing
together
with
services
rendered
to
great
persons
now
in
power
recommended
him
to
the
president
of
the
council
who
put
him
in
de
barante
department
until
such
time
as
a
controllership
should
fall
vacant
so
the
part
that
du
chatelet
once
had
played
in
the
history
of
the
imperial
princess
his
reputation
for
success
with
women
the
strange
story
of
his
travels
and
sufferings
all
awakened
the
interest
of
the
ladies
of
angouleme
le
baron
sixte
du
chatelet
informed
himself
as
to
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
upper
town
and
took
his
cue
accordingly
he
appeared
on
the
scene
as
a
jaded
man
of
the
world
broken
in
health
and
weary
in
spirit
he
would
raise
his
hand
to
his
forehead
at
all
seasons
as
if
pain
never
gave
him
a
moment
respite
a
habit
that
recalled
his
travels
and
made
him
interesting
he
was
on
visiting
terms
with
the
authorities
the
general
in
command
the
prefect
the
and
the
bishop
but
in
every
house
he
was
frigid
polite
and
slightly
supercilious
like
a
man
out
of
his
proper
place
awaiting
the
favors
of
power
his
social
talents
he
left
to
conjecture
nor
did
they
lose
anything
in
reputation
on
that
account
then
when
people
began
to
talk
about
him
and
wish
to
know
him
and
curiosity
was
still
lively
when
he
had
reconnoitred
the
men
and
found
them
nought
and
studied
the
women
with
the
eyes
of
experience
in
the
cathedral
for
several
sundays
he
saw
that
mme
de
bargeton
was
the
person
with
whom
it
would
be
best
to
be
on
intimate
terms
music
he
thought
should
open
the
doors
of
a
house
where
strangers
were
never
received
surreptitiously
he
procured
one
of
miroir
masses
learned
it
upon
the
piano
and
one
fine
sunday
when
all
angouleme
went
to
the
cathedral
he
played
the
organ
sent
those
who
knew
no
better
into
ecstasies
over
the
performance
and
stimulated
the
interest
felt
in
him
by
allowing
his
name
to
slip
out
through
the
attendants
as
he
came
out
after
mass
mme
de
bargeton
complimented
him
regretting
that
she
had
no
opportunity
of
playing
duets
with
such
a
musician
and
naturally
during
an
interview
of
her
own
seeking
he
received
the
passport
which
he
could
not
have
obtained
if
he
had
asked
for
it
so
the
adroit
baron
was
admitted
to
the
circle
of
the
queen
of
angouleme
and
paid
her
marked
attention
the
elderly
beau
he
was
years
old
saw
that
all
her
youth
lay
dormant
and
ready
to
revive
saw
treasures
to
be
turned
to
account
and
possibly
a
rich
widow
to
wed
to
say
nothing
of
expectations
it
would
be
a
marriage
into
the
family
of
negrepelisse
and
for
him
this
meant
a
family
connection
with
the
marquise
and
a
political
career
in
paris
here
was
a
fair
tree
to
cultivate
in
spite
of
the
unsightly
mistletoe
that
grew
thick
upon
it
he
would
hang
his
fortunes
upon
it
and
prune
it
and
wait
till
he
could
gather
its
golden
fruit
angouleme
shrieked
against
the
introduction
of
a
giaour
into
the
sanctuary
for

was
a
kind
of
holy
of

in

society
that
kept
itself

the
only

there

admitted
twice
or
thrice
in

go
to

and

at

house
but
she
never
accepted

gentility

there
was
always
something
amiss
that

nothing
in

was

or

but
for

could
not

the
manners
and
spirit
of

ruined

knowledge
of

breeding
these
things
covered
a
multitude
of
deficiencies
nobility
of
feeling
was
far
more
real
here
than
in
the
lofty
world
of
paris
you
might
compare
these
country
royalists
if
the
metaphor
may
be
allowed
to
silver
plate
antiquated
and
tarnished
but
weighty
their
attachment
to
the
house
of
bourbon
as
the
house
of
bourbon
did
them
honor
the
very
fixity
of
their
political
opinions
was
a
sort
of
faithfulness
the
distance
that
they
set
between
themselves
and
the
their
very
exclusiveness
gave
them
a
certain
elevation
and
enhanced
their
value
each
noble
represented
a
certain
price
for
the
townsmen
as

are
told
attach
a
money

to

some
of
the
women
flattered
by

discerned
in
him
the
superior
qualities
lacking
in
the
men
of
their
own
sect
and
the
insurrection
of
was
pacified
these
ladies
all
hoped
to
succeed
to
the
imperial
highness
purists
were
of
the
opinion
that
you
might
see
the
intruder
in
mme
de
bargeton
house
but
not
elsewhere
du
chatelet
was
fain
to
put
up
with
a
good
deal
of
insolence
but
he
held
his
ground
by
cultivating
the
clergy
he
encouraged
the
queen
of
angouleme
in
foibles
bred
of
the
soil
he
brought
her
all
the
newest
books
he
read
aloud
the
poetry
that
appeared
together
they
went
into
ecstasies
over
these
poets
she
in
all
sincerity
he
with
suppressed
yawns
but
he
bore
with
the
romantics
with
a
patience
hardly
to
be
expected
of
a
man
of
the
imperial
school
who
scarcely
could
make
out
what
the
young
writers
meant
not
so
mme
de
bargeton
she
waxed
enthusiastic
over
the
renaissance
due
to
the
return
of
the
bourbon
lilies
she
loved
de
chateaubriand
for
calling
victor
hugo
a
sublime
child
it
depressed
her
that
she
could
only
know
genius
from
afar
she
sighed
for
paris
where
great
men
live
for
these
reasons
du
chatelet
thought
he
had
done
a
wonderfully
clever
thing
when
he
told
the
lady
that
at
that
moment
in
angouleme
there
was
another
sublime
child
a
young
poet
a
rising
star
whose
glory
surpassed
the
whole
parisian
galaxy
though
he
knew
it
not
a
great
man
of
the
future
had
been
born
in
the
headmaster
of
the
school
had
shown
the
baron
some
admirable
verses
the
poor
and
humble
lad
was
a
second
chatterton
with
none
of
the
political
baseness
and
ferocious
hatred
of
the
great
ones
of
earth
that
led
his
english
prototype
to
turn
pamphleteer
and
revile
his
benefactors
mme
de
bargeton
in
her
little
circle
of
five
or
six
persons
who
were
supposed
to
share
her
tastes
for
art
and
letters
because
this
one
scraped
a
fiddle
and
that
splashed
sheets
of
white
paper
more
or
less
with
sepia
and
the
other
was
president
of
a
local
agricultural
society
or
was
gifted
with
a
bass
voice
that
rendered
fiato
in
like
a
war
whoop
mme
de
bargeton
amid
these
grotesque
figures
was
like
a
famished
actor
set
down
to
a
stage
dinner
of
pasteboard
no
words
therefore
can
describe
her
joy
at
these
tidings
she
must
see
this
poet
this
angel
she
raved
about
him
went
into
raptures
talked
of
him
for
whole
hours
together
before
two
days
were
out
the
sometime
diplomatic
courier
had
negotiated
through
the
headmaster
for
appearance
in
the
hotel
de
bargeton
poor
helots
of
the
provinces
for
whom
the
distances
between
class
and
class
are
so
far
greater
than
for
the
parisian
for
whom
indeed
these
distances
visibly
lessen
day
by
day
souls
so
grievously
oppressed
by
the
social
barriers
behind
which
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
sit
crying
with
mutual
anathemas
you
and
you
alone
will
fully
comprehend
the
ferment
in
lucien
heart
and
brain
when
his
headmaster
told
him
that
the
great
gates
of
the
hotel
de
bargeton
would
shortly
open
and
turn
upon
their
hinges
at
his
fame
lucien
and
david
walking
together
of
an
evening
in
the
promenade
de
beaulieu
had
looked
up
at
the
house
with
the
gables
and
wondered
whether
their
names
would
ever
so
much
as
reach
ears
inexorably
deaf
to
knowledge
that
came
from
a
lowly
origin
and
now
he
lucien
was
to
be
made
welcome
there
no
one
except
his
sister
was
in
the
secret
eve
like
the
thrifty
housekeeper
and
divine
magician
that
she
was
conjured
up
a
few
louis
from
her
savings
to
buy
thin
shoes
for
lucien
of
the
best
shoemaker
in
angouleme
and
an
entirely
new
suit
of
clothes
from
the
most
renowned
tailor
she
made
a
frill
for
his
best
shirt
and
washed
and
pleated
it
with
her
own
hands
and
how
pleased
she
was
to
see
him
so
dressed
how
proud
she
felt
of
her
brother
and
what
quantities
of
advice
she
gave
him
her
intuition
foresaw
countless
foolish
fears
lucien
had
a
habit
of
resting
his
elbows
on
the
table
when
he
was
in
deep
thought
he
would
even
go
so
far
as
to
draw
a
table
nearer
to
lean
upon
it
eve
told
him
that
he
must
not
forget
himself
in
those
aristocratic
precincts
she
went
with
him
as
far
as
peter
gate
and
when
they
were
almost
opposite
the
cathedral
she
stopped
and
watched
him
pass
down
the
rue
de
beaulieu
to
the
promenade
where
du
chatelet
was
waiting
for
him
and
after
he
was
out
of
sight
she
still
stood
there
poor
girl
in
a
great
tremor
of
emotion
as
though
some
great
thing
had
happened
to
them
lucien
in
mme
de
bargeton
house
for
eve
it
meant
the
dawn
of
success
the
innocent
creature
did
not
suspect
that
where
ambition
begins
ingenuous
feeling
ends
externals
in
the
rue
du
minage
gave
lucien
no
sense
of
surprise
this
palace
that
loomed
so
large
in
his
imagination
was
a
house
built
of
the
soft
stone
of
the
country
mellowed
by
time
it
looked
dismal
enough
from
the
street
and
inside
it
was
extremely
plain
there
was
the
usual
provincial
courtyard
chilly
prim
and
neat
and
the
house
itself
was
sober
almost
but
in
good
repair
lucien
went
up
the
old
staircase
with
the
balustrade
of
chestnut
wood
the
stone
steps
ceased
after
the
second
floor
crossed
a
shabby
antechamber
and
came
into
the
presence
in
a
little
wainscoted
beyond
a
salon
the
carved
woodwork
in
the
taste
of
the
eighteenth
century
had
been
painted
gray
there
were
monochrome
paintings
on
the
frieze
panels
and
the
walls
were
adorned
with
crimson
damask
with
a
meagre
border
the
furniture
shrank
piteously
from
sight
under
covers
of
a
check
pattern
on
the
sofa
covered
with
thin
mattressed
cushions
sat
mme
de
bargeton
the
poet
beheld
her
by
the
light
of
two
wax
candles
on
a
sconce
with
a
screen
fitted
to
it
that
stood
before
her
on
a
round
table
with
a
green
cloth
the
queen
did
not
attempt
to
rise
but
she
twisted
very
gracefully
on
her
seat
smiling
on
the
poet
who
was
not
a
little
fluttered
by
the
serpentine
quiverings
her
manner
was
distinguished
he
thought
for
mme
de
bargeton
she
was
impressed
with
lucien
extreme
beauty
with
his
diffidence
with
everything
about
him
for
her
the
poet
already
was
poetry
incarnate
lucien
scrutinized
his
hostess
with
discreet
side
glances
she
disappointed
none
of
his
expectations
of
a
great
lady
mme
de
bargeton
following
a
new
fashion
wore
a
coif
of
slashed
black
velvet
a
that
recalls
memories
of
mediaeval
legend
to
a
young
imagination
to
amplify
as
it
were
the
dignity
of
womanhood
her
hair
escaping
from
under
her
cap
hung
loose
bright
golden
color
in
the
light
red
in
the
rounded
shadow
of
the
curls
that
only
partially
hid
her
neck
beneath
a
massive
white
brow
clean
cut
and
strongly
outlined
shone
a
pair
of
bright
gray
eyes
encircled
by
a
margin
of
two
blue
veins
on
each
side
of
the
nose
bringing
out
the
whiteness
of
that
delicate
setting
the
bourbon
curve
of
the
nose
added
to
the
ardent
expression
of
an
oval
face
it
was
as
if
the
royal
temper
of
the
house
of
conde
shone
conspicuous
in
this
feature
the
careless
of
the
bodice
left
a
white
throat
bare
and
half
revealed
the
outlines
of
a
still
youthful
figure
and
shapely
well
placed
contours
beneath
with
fingers
tapering
and
though
somewhat
too
thin
mme
de
bargeton
amiably
pointed
to
a
seat
by
her
side
du
chatelet
ensconced
himself
in
an
and
lucien
then
became
aware
that
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
mme
de
bargeton
words
intoxicated
the
young
poet
from
for
lucien
those
three
hours
spent
in
her
presence
went
by
like
a
dream
that
we
would
fain
have
last
forever
she
was
not
thin
he
thought
she
was
slender
in
love
with
love
and
loverless
and
delicate
in
spite
of
her
strength
her
foibles
exaggerated
by
her
manner
took
his
fancy
for
youth
sets
out
with
a
love
of
hyperbole
that
infirmity
of
noble
souls
he
did
not
so
much
as
see
that
her
cheeks
were
faded
that
the
patches
of
color
on
the
were
faded
and
hardened
to
a
by
listless
days
and
a
certain
amount
of
ailing
health
his
imagination
fastened
at
once
on
the
glowing
eyes
on
the
dainty
curls
rippling
with
light
on
the
dazzling
fairness
of
her
skin
and
hovered
about
those
bright
points
as
the
moth
hovers
about
the
candle
flame
for
her
spirit
made
such
appeal
to
his
that
he
could
no
longer
see
the
woman
as
she
was
her
feminine
exaltation
had
carried
him
away
the
energy
of
her
expressions
a
little
staled
in
truth
by
pretty
hard
and
constant
wear
but
new
to
lucien
fascinated
him
so
much
the
more
easily
because
he
was
determined
to
be
pleased
he
had
brought
none
of
his
own
verses
to
read
but
nothing
was
said
of
them
he
had
purposely
left
them
behind
because
he
meant
to
return
and
mme
de
bargeton
did
not
ask
for
them
because
she
meant
that
he
should
come
back
some
future
day
to
read
them
to
her
was
not
this
a
beginning
of
an
understanding
as
for
sixte
du
chatelet
he
was
not
over
well
pleased
with
all
this
he
perceived
rather
too
late
in
the
day
that
he
had
a
rival
in
this
handsome
young
fellow
he
went
with
him
as
far
as
the
first
flight
of
steps
below
beaulieu
to
try
the
effect
of
a
little
diplomacy
and
lucien
was
not
a
little
astonished
when
he
heard
the
controller
of
excise
pluming
himself
on
having
effected
the
introduction
and
proceeding
in
this
character
to
give
him
lucien
the
benefit
of
his
advice
heaven
send
that
lucien
might
meet
with
better
treatment
than
he
had
done
such
was
the
matter
of
du
chatelet
discourse
the
court
was
less
insolent
that
this
pack
of
dolts
in
angouleme
you
were
expected
to
endure
deadly
insults
the
superciliousness
you
had
to
put
up
with
was
something
abominable
if
this
kind
of
folk
did
not
alter
their
behavior
there
would
be
another
revolution
of
as
for
himself
if
he
continued
to
go
to
the
house
it
was
because
he
had
found
mme
de
bargeton
to
his
taste
she
was
the
only
woman
worth
troubling
about
in
angouleme
he
had
been
paying
court
to
her
for
want
of
anything
better
to
do
and
now
he
was
desperately
in
love
with
her
she
would
be
his
before
very
long
she
loved
him
everything
pointed
that
way
the
conquest
of
this
haughty
queen
of
the
society
would
be
his
one
revenge
on
the
whole
houseful
of
booby
clodpates
chatelet
talked
of
his
passion
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
would
have
a
rival
life
if
he
crossed
his
path
the
elderly
butterfly
of
the
empire
came
down
with
his
whole
weight
on
the
poor
poet
and
tried
to
frighten
and
crush
him
by
his
he
grew
taller
as
he
gave
an
embellished
account
of
his
perilous
wanderings
but
while
he
impressed
the
poet
imagination
the
lover
was
by
no
means
afraid
of
him
in
spite
of
the
elderly
coxcomb
and
regardless
of
his
threats
and
airs
of
a
bravo
lucien
went
back
again
and
again
to
the
house
not
too
often
at
first
as
became
a
man
of
but
before
very
long
he
grew
accustomed
to
the
vast
condescension
as
it
had
seemed
to
him
at
the
outset
and
came
more
and
more
frequently
the
druggist
son
was
a
completely
insignificant
being
if
any
of
the
men
or
women
calling
upon
nais
found
lucien
in
the
room
they
met
him
with
the
overwhelming
graciousness
that
people
use
towards
their
inferiors
lucien
thought
them
very
kind
for
a
time
and
later
found
out
the
real
reason
for
their
specious
amiability
it
was
not
long
before
he
detected
a
patronizing
tone
that
stirred
his
gall
and
confirmed
him
in
his
bitter
republicanism
a
phase
of
opinion
through
which
many
a
patrician
passes
by
way
of
prelude
to
his
introduction
to
polite
society
but
was
there
anything
that
he
would
not
have
endured
for
nais
for
so
he
heard
her
named
by
the
clan
like
spanish
grandees
and
the
old
austrian
nobility
at
vienna
these
folk
men
and
women
alike
called
each
other
by
their
christian
names
a
final
shade
of
distinction
in
the
inmost
ring
of
angoumoisin
aristocracy
lucien
loved
nais
as
a
young
man
loves
the
first
woman
who
flatters
him
for
nais
prophesied
great
things
and
boundless
fame
for
lucien
she
used
all
her
skill
to
secure
her
hold
upon
her
poet
not
merely
did
she
exalt
him
beyond
measure
but
she
represented
him
to
himself
as
a
child
without
fortune
whom
she
meant
to
start
in
life
she
treated
him
like
a
child
to
keep
him
near
her
she
made
him
her
reader
her
secretary
and
cared
more
for
him
than
she
would
have
thought
possible
after
the
dreadful
calamity
that
had
befallen
her
she
was
very
cruel
to
herself
in
those
days
telling
herself
that
it
would
be
folly
to
love
a
young
man
of
twenty
so
far
apart
from
her
socially
in
the
first
place
and
her
behavior
to
him
was
a
bewildering
mixture
of
familiarity
and
capricious
fits
of
pride
arising
from
her
fears
and
scruples
she
was
sometimes
a
lofty
patroness
sometimes
she
was
tender
and
flattered
him
at
first
while
he
was
overawed
by
her
rank
lucien
experienced
the
extremes
of
dread
hope
and
despair
the
torture
of
a
first
love
that
is
beaten
deep
into
the
heart
with
the
hammer
strokes
of
alternate
bliss
and
anguish
for
two
months
mme
de
bargeton
was
for
him
a
benefactress
who
would
take
a
mother
interest
in
him
but
confidences
came
next
mme
de
bargeton
began
to
address
her
poet
as
dear
lucien
and
then
as
dear
without
more
ado
the
poet
grew
bolder
and
addressed
the
great
lady
as
nais
and
there
followed
a
flash
of
anger
that
captivates
a
boy
she
reproached
him
for
calling
her
by
a
name
in
everybody
mouth
the
haughty
and
negrepelisse
offered
the
fair
angel
youth
that
one
of
her
appellations
which
was
unsoiled
by
use
for
him
she
would
be
louise
lucien
was
in
the
third
heaven
one
evening
when
lucien
came
in
he
found
mme
de
bargeton
looking
at
a
portrait
which
she
promptly
put
away
he
wished
to
see
it
and
to
quiet
the
despair
of
a
first
fit
of
jealousy
louise
showed
him
picture
and
told
with
tears
the
piteous
story
of
a
love
so
stainless
so
cruelly
cut
short
was
she
experimenting
with
herself
was
she
trying
a
first
unfaithfulness
to
the
memory
of
the
dead
or
had
she
taken
it
into
her
head
to
raise
up
a
rival
to
lucien
in
the
portrait
lucien
was
too
much
of
a
boy
to
analyze
his
he
gave
way
to
unfeigned
despair
when
she
opened
the
campaign
by
entrenching
herself
behind
the
more
or
less
skilfully
devised
scruples
which
women
raise
to
have
them
battered
down
when
a
woman
begins
to
talk
about
her
duty
regard
for
appearances
or
religion
the
objections
she
raises
are
so
many
redoubts
which
she
loves
to
have
carried
by
storm
but
on
the
guileless
lucien
these
coquetries
were
thrown
away
he
would
have
advanced
of
his
own
accord
shall
not
die
for
you
i
will
live
for
you
he
cried
audaciously
one
evening
he
meant
to
have
no
more
of
de
and
gave
louise
a
glance
which
told
plainly
that
a
crisis
was
at
hand
startled
at
the
progress
of
this
new
love
in
herself
and
her
poet
louise
demanded
some
verses
promised
for
the
first
page
of
her
album
looking
for
a
pretext
for
a
quarrel
in
his
tardiness
but
what
became
of
her
when
she
read
the
following
stanzas
which
naturally
she
considered
finer
than
the
finest
work
of
canalis
the
poet
of
the
aristocracy
the
magic
brush
light
flying
flights
of
song
to
these
but
not
to
these
alone
belong
my
pages
fair
often
to
me
my
mistress
pencil
steals
to
tell
the
secret
gladness
that
she
feels
the
hidden
care
and
when
her
fingers
slowlier
at
the
last
of
a
rich
future
now
become
the
past
seek
count
of
me
oh
love
when
swift
memories
rise
i
pray
of
thee
may
they
bring
visions
fair
as
cloudless
skies
of
happy
voyage
a
summer
sea
was
it
really
i
who
inspired
those
lines
she
asked
the
doubt
suggested
by
coquetry
to
a
woman
who
amused
herself
by
playing
with
fire
brought
tears
to
lucien
eyes
but
her
first
kiss
upon
his
forehead
calmed
the
storm
decidedly
lucien
was
a
great
man
and
she
meant
to
form
him
she
thought
of
teaching
him
italian
and
german
and
perfecting
his
manners
that
would
be
pretext
sufficient
for
having
him
constantly
with
her
under
the
very
eyes
of
her
tiresome
courtiers
what
an
interest
in
her
life
she
took
up
music
again
for
her
poet
sake
and
revealed
the
world
of
sound
to
him
playing
grand
fragments
of
beethoven
till
she
sent
him
into
ecstasy
and
happy
in
his
delight
turned
to
the
poet
is
not
such
happiness
as
this
enough
she
asked
hypocritically
and
poor
lucien
was
stupid
enough
to
answer
yes
in
the
previous
week
things
had
reached
such
a
point
that
louise
had
judged
it
expedient
to
ask
lucien
to
dine
with
de
bargeton
as
a
third
but
in
spite
of
this
precaution
the
whole
town
knew
the
state
of
affairs
and
so
extraordinary
did
it
appear
that
no
one
would
believe
the
truth
the
outcry
was
terrific
some
were
of
the
opinion
that
society
was
on
the
eve
of
cataclysm
see
what
comes
of
liberal
doctrines
cried
others
then
it
was
that
the
jealous
du
chatelet
discovered
that
madame
charlotte
the
monthly
nurse
was
no
other
than
mme
chardon
the
mother
of
the
chateaubriand
of
as
he
put
it
the
remark
passed
muster
as
a
joke
mme
de
chandour
was
the
first
to
hurry
to
mme
de
bargeton
nais
dear
she
said
do
you
know
what
everybody
is
talking
about
in
angouleme
this
little
rhymster
mother
is
the
madame
charlotte
who
nursed
my
through
her
confinement
two
months
ago
what
is
there
extraordinary
in
that
my
dear
asked
mme
de
bargeton
with
her
most
regal
air
she
is
a
druggist
widow
is
she
not
a
poor
fate
for
a
rubempre
suppose
that
you
and
i
had
not
a
penny
in
the
world
what
should
either
of
us
do
for
a
living
how
would
you
support
your
children
mme

presence
of
mind
put
an
end
to
the
jeremiads
of
the
great
natures
are
prone
to
make
a
virtue
of
misfortune
and
there
is
something
irresistibly
attractive
about
when
persisted
in
through
evil
report
innocence
has
the
piquancy
of
the
forbidden
mme
de
bargeton
rooms
were
crowded
that
evening
with
friends
who
came
to
remonstrate
with
her
she
brought
her
most
caustic
wit
into
play
she
said
that
as
noble
families
could
not
produce
a
moliere
a
racine
a
rousseau
a
voltaire
a
massillon
a
beaumarchais
or
a
diderot
people
must
make
up
their
minds
to
it
and
accept
the
fact
that
great
men
had
upholsterers
and
clockmakers
and
cutlers
for
their
fathers
she
said
that
genius
was
always
noble
she
railed
at
boorish
squires
for
understanding
their
real
interests
so
imperfectly
in
short
she
talked
a
good
deal
of
nonsense
which
would
have
let
the
light
into
heads
less
dense
but
left
her
audience
agape
at
her
eccentricity
and
in
these
ways
she
conjured
away
the
storm
with
her
heavy
artillery
when
lucien
obedient
to
her
request
appeared
for
the
first
time
in
the
faded
great
where
the
were
set
out
she
welcomed
him
graciously
and
brought
him
forward
like
a
queen
who
means
to
be
obeyed
she
addressed
the
controller
of
excise
as
chatelet
and
left
that
gentleman
thunderstruck
by
the
discovery
that
she
knew
about
the
illegal
superfetation
of
the
particle
lucien
was
forced
upon
her
circle
and
was
received
as
a
poisonous
element
which
every
person
in
it
vowed
to
expel
with
the
antidote
of
insolence
nais
had
won
a
victory
but
she
had
lost
her
supremacy
of
empire
there
was
a
rumor
of
insurrection
amelie
otherwise
mme
de
chandour
harkening
to
chatelet
counsels
determined
to
erect
a
rival
altar
by
receiving
on
wednesdays
now
mme
de
bargeton
salon
was
open
every
evening
and
those
who
frequented
it
were
so
wedded
to
their
ways
so
accustomed
to
meet
about
the
same
tables
to
play
the
familiar
game
of
backgammon
to
see
the
same
faces
and
the
same
candle
sconces
night
after
night
and
afterwards
to
cloak
and
shawl
and
put
on
overshoes
and
hats
in
the
old
corridor
that
they
were
quite
as
much
attached
to
the
steps
of
the
staircase
as
to
the
mistress
of
the
house
all
resigned
themselves
to
endure
the
songster
of
the
sacred
grove
said
alexandre
de
brebian
which
was
witticism
number
two
finally
the
president
of
the
agricultural
society
put
an
end
to
the
sedition
by
remarking
judicially
that
before
the
revolution
the
greatest
nobles
admitted
men
like
dulcos
and
grimm
and
crebillon
to
their
society
men
who
were
nobodies
like
this
little
poet
of
but
one
thing
they
never
did
they
never
received
and
after
all
chatelet
is
only
a
du
chatelet
suffered
for
chardon
every
one
turned
the
cold
shoulder
upon
him
and
chatelet
was
conscious
that
he
was
attacked
when
mme
de
bargeton
called
him
chatelet
he
swore
to
himself
that
he
would
possess
her
and
now
he
entered
into
the
views
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
came
to
the
support
of
the
young
poet
and
declared
himself
lucien
friend
the
great
diplomatist
overlooked
by
the
shortsighted
emperor
made
much
of
lucien
and
declared
himself
his
friend
to
launch
the
poet
into
society
he
gave
a
dinner
and
asked
all
the
authorities
to
meet
him
the
prefect
the
the
colonel
in
command
of
the
garrison
the
head
of
the
naval
school
the
president
of
the
court
and
so
forth
the
poet
poor
fellow
was
feted
so
magnificently
and
so
belauded
that
anybody
but
a
young
man
of
would
have
shrewdly
suspected
a
hoax
after
dinner
chatelet
drew
his
rival
on
to
recite
dying
the
masterpiece
of
the
hour
and
the
headmaster
of
the
school
a
man
of
a
phlegmatic
temperament
applauded
with
both
hands
and
vowed
that
rousseau
had
done
nothing
finer
sixte
baron
du
chatelet
thought
in
his
heart
that
this
slip
of
a
rhymster
would
wither
incontinently
in
a
hothouse
of
adulation
perhaps
he
hoped
that
when
the
poet
head
was
turned
with
brilliant
dreams
he
would
indulge
in
some
impertinence
that
would
promptly
consign
him
to
the
obscurity
from
which
he
had
emerged
pending
the
decease
of
genius
chatelet
appeared
to
offer
up
his
hopes
as
a
sacrifice
at
mme
de
bargeton
feet
but
with
the
ingenuity
of
a
rake
he
kept
his
own
plan
in
abeyance
watching
the
lovers
movements
with
keenly
critical
eyes
and
waiting
for
the
opportunity
of
ruining
lucien
from
this
time
forward
vague
rumors
reported
the
existence
of
a
great
man
in
angoumois
mme
de
bargeton
was
praised
on
all
sides
for
the
interest
which
she
took
in
this
young
eagle
no
sooner
was
her
conduct
approved
than
she
tried
to
win
a
general
sanction
she
announced
a
soiree
with
ices
tea
and
cakes
a
great
innovation
in
a
city
where
tea
as
yet
was
sold
only
by
druggists
as
a
remedy
for
indigestion
the
flower
of
angoumoisin
aristocracy
was
summoned
to
hear
lucien
read
his
great
work
louise
had
hidden
all
the
difficulties
from
her
friend
but
she
let
fall
a
few
words
touching
the
social
cabal
formed
against
him
she
would
not
have
him
ignorant
of
the
perils
besetting
his
career
as
a
man
of
genius
nor
of
the
obstacles
insurmountable
to
weaklings
she
drew
a
lesson
from
the
recent
victory
her
white
hands
pointed
him
to
glory
that
lay
beyond
a
prolonged
martyrdom
she
spoke
of
stakes
and
flaming
pyres
she
spread
the
adjectives
thickly
on
her
finest
and
decorated
them
with
a
variety
of
her
most
pompous
epithets
it
was
an
infringement
of
the
copyright
of
the
passages
of
declamation
that
disfigure
but
louise
grew
so
much
the
greater
in
her
own
eyes
as
she
talked
that
she
loved
the
benjamin
who
inspired
her
eloquence
the
more
for
it
she
counseled
him
to
take
a
bold
step
and
renounce
his
patronymic
for
the
noble
name
of
rubempre
he
need
not
mind
the
little
over
a
change
which
the
king
for
that
matter
would
authorize
mme
de
bargeton
undertook
to
procure
this
favor
she
was
related
to
the
marquise
who
was
a
before
her
marriage
and
a
at
court
the
words
king
marquise
and
the
court
dazzled
lucien
like
a
blaze
of
fireworks
and
the
necessity
of
the
baptism
was
plain
to
him
dear
child
said
louise
with
tender
mockery
in
her
tones
the
sooner
it
is
done
the
sooner
it
will
be
sanctioned
she
went
through
social
strata
and
showed
the
poet
that
this
step
would
raise
him
many
rungs
higher
in
the
ladder
seizing
the
moment
she
persuaded
lucien
to
forswear
the
chimerical
notions
of
as
to
equality
she
roused
a
thirst
for
social
distinction
allayed
by
david
cool
commonsense
she
pointed
out
fashionable
society
as
the
goal
and
the
only
stage
for
such
a
talent
as
his
the
rabid
liberal
became
a
monarchist
lucien
set
his
teeth
in
the
apple
of
desire
of
rank
luxury
and
fame
he
swore
to
win
a
crown
to
lay
at
his
lady
feet
even
if
there
should
be
on
the
bays
he
would
conquer
at
any
cost
to
prove
his
courage
he
told
her
of
his
present
way
of
life
louise
had
known
nothing
of
its
hardships
for
there
is
an
indefinable
pudency
inseparable
from
strong
feeling
in
youth
a
delicacy
which
shrinks
from
a
display
of
great
qualities
and
a
young
man
loves
to
have
the
real
quality
of
his
nature
discerned
through
the
incognito
he
described
that
life
the
shackles
of
poverty
borne
with
pride
his
days
of
work
for
david
his
nights
of
study
his
young
ardor
recalled
memories
of
the
colonel
of
mme
de
bargeton
eyes
grew
soft
and
lucien
seeing
this
weakness
in
his
mistress
seized
a
hand
that
she
had
abandoned
to
him
and
kissed
it
with
the
frenzy
of
a
lover
and
a
poet
in
his
youth
louise
even
allowed
him
to
set
his
eager
quivering
lips
upon
her
forehead
oh
child
child
if
any
one
should
see
us
i
should
look
very
ridiculous
she
said
shaking
off
the
ecstatic
torpor
in
the
course
of
that
evening
mme
de
bargeton
wit
made
havoc
of
lucien
prejudices
as
she
styled
them
men
of
genius
according
to
her
doctrine
had
neither
brothers
nor
sisters
nor
father
nor
mother
the
great
tasks
laid
upon
them
required
that
they
should
sacrifice
everything
that
they
might
grow
to
their
full
stature
perhaps
their
families
might
suffer
at
first
from
the
exactions
of
a
giant
brain
but
at
a
later
day
they
were
repaid
a
hundredfold
for
of
every
kind
during
the
early
struggles
of
the
kingly
intellect
with
adverse
fate
they
shared
the
spoils
of
victory
genius
was
answerable
to
no
man
genius
alone
could
judge
of
the
means
used
to
an
end
which
no
one
else
could
know
it
was
the
duty
of
a
man
of
genius
therefore
to
set
himself
above
law
it
was
his
mission
to
reconstruct
law
the
man
who
is
master
of

take

loosen
the
of
provincial
life
that
confined

of

determined
to

his
without
laying
himself

the

opportunity

blended
with
his

he
loved
and
he
meant
to
rise
a
double
desire
not
unnatural
in

with

heart
to
satisfy

the
battle
of

would
fain
have
it
otherwise
but
intrusive
fact
too
often
gives
the
lie
to
the
fiction
which
we
should
like
to
believe
making
it
impossible
to
paint
the
young
man
of
the
nineteenth
century
other
than
he
is
lucien
imagined
that
his
scheming
was
entirely
prompted
by
good
feeling
and
persuaded
himself
that
it
was
done
solely
for
his
friend
david
sake
he
wrote
a
long
letter
to
his
louise
he
felt
bolder
pen
in
hand
than
face
to
face
in
a
dozen
sheets
copied
out
three
several
times
he
told
her
of
his
father
genius
and
blighted
hopes
and
of
his
grinding
poverty
he
described
his
beloved
sister
as
an
angel
and
david
as
another
cuvier
a
great
man
of
the
future
and
a
father
friend
and
brother
to
him
in
the
present
he
should
feel
himself
unworthy
of
his
louise
love
his
proudest
distinction
if
he
did
not
ask
her
to
do
for
david
all
that
she
had
done
for
him
he
would
give
up
everything
rather
than
desert
david
sechard
david
must
witness
his
success
it
was
one
of
those
wild
letters
in
which
a
young
man
points
a
pistol
at
a
refusal
letters
full
of
boyish
casuistry
and
the
incoherent
reasoning
of
an
idealist
a
delicious
tissue
of
words
embroidered
here
and
there
by
the
naive
utterances
that
women
love
so
well
unconscious
revelations
of
the
writer
heart
lucien
left
the
letter
with
the
housemaid
went
to
the
office
and
spent
the
day
in
reading
proofs
superintending
the
execution
of
orders
and
looking
after
the
affairs
of
the
he
said
not
a
word
to
david
while
youth
bears
a
child
heart
it
is
capable
of
sublime
reticence
perhaps
too
lucien
began
to
dread
the
phocion
axe
which
david
could
wield
when
he
chose
perhaps
he
was
afraid
to
meet
those
eyes
that
read
the
depths
of
his
soul
but
when
he
read
chenier
poems
with
david
his
secret
rose
from
his
heart
to
his
lips
at
the
sting
of
a
reproach
that
he
felt
as
the
patient
feels
the
probing
of
a
wound
and
now
try
to
understand
the
thoughts
that
troubled
lucien
mind
as
he
went
down
from
angouleme
was
the
great
lady
angry
with
him
would
she
receive
david
had
he
lucien
in
his
ambition
flung
himself
headlong
back
into
the
depths
of
before
he
set
that
kiss
on
louise
forehead
he
had
had
time
to
measure
the
distance
between
a
queen
and
her
favorite
so
far
had
he
come
in
five
months
and
he
did
not
tell
himself
that
david
could
cross
over
the
same
ground
in
a
moment
yet
he
did
not
know
how
completely
the
lower
orders
were
excluded
from
this
upper
world
he
did
not
so
much
as
suspect
that
a
second
experiment
of
this
kind
meant
ruin
for
mme
de
bargeton
once
accused
and
fairly
convicted
of
a
liking
for
louise
would
be
driven
from
the
place
her
caste
would
shun
her
as
men
shunned
a
leper
in
the
middle
ages
nais
might
have
broken
the
moral
law
and
her
whole
circle
the
clergy
and
the
flower
of
the
aristocracy
would
have
defended
her
against
the
world
through
thick
and
then
but
a
breach
of
another
law
the
offence
of
admitting
all
sorts
of
people
to
her
house
this
was
sin
without
remission
the
sins
of
those
in
power
are
always
overlooked
once
let
them
abdicate
and
they
shall
pay
the
penalty
and
what
was
it
but
abdication
to
receive
david
but
if
lucien
did
not
see
these
aspects
of
the
question
his
aristocratic
instinct
discerned
plenty
of
difficulties
of
another
kind
and
he
took
alarm
a
fine
manner
is
not
the
invariable
outcome
of
noble
feeling
and
while
no
man
at
court
had
a
nobler
air
than
racine
corneille
looked
very
much
like
a
and
descartes
might
have
been
taken
for
an
honest
dutch
merchant
and
visitors
to
la
brede
meeting
montesquieu
in
a
cotton
nightcap
carrying
a
rake
over
his
shoulder
mistook
him
for
a
gardener
a
knowledge
of
the
world
when
it
is
not
sucked
in
with
mother
milk
and
part
of
the
inheritance
of
descent
is
only
acquired
by
education
supplemented
by
certain
gifts
of
chance
a
graceful
figure
distinction
of
feature
a
certain
ring
in
the
voice
all
these
so
important
trifles
david
lacked
while
nature
had
bestowed
them
upon
his
friend
of
gentle
blood
on
the
mother
side
lucien
was
a
frank
even
down
to
the
instep
david
had
inherited
the
physique
of
his
father
the
pressman
and
the
flat
foot
of
the
gael
lucien
could
hear
the
shower
of
jokes
at
david
expense
he
could
see
mme
de
bargeton
repressed
smile
and
at
length
without
being
exactly
ashamed
of
his
brother
he
made
up
his
mind
to
disregard
his
first
impulse
and
to
think
twice
before
yielding
to
it
in
future
so
after
the
hour
of
poetry
and
after
the
reading
of
verse
that
opened
out
before
the
friends
the
fields
of
literature
in
the
light
of
a
sun
the
hour
of
worldly
wisdom
and
of
scheming
struck
for
lucien
down
once
more
in
he
wished
that
he
had
not
written
that
letter
he
wished
he
could
have
it
back
again
for
down
the
vista
of
the
future
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
inexorable
laws
of
the
world
he
guessed
that
nothing
succeeds
like
success
and
it
cost
him
something
to
step
down
from
the
first
rung
of
the
scaling
ladder
by
which
he
meant
to
reach
and
storm
the
heights
above
pictures
of
his
quiet
and
simple
life
rose
before
him
pictures
fair
with
the
brightest
colors
of
blossoming
love
there
was
david
what
a
genius
david
had
david
who
had
helped
him
so
generously
and
would
die
for
him
at
need
he
thought
of
his
mother
of
how
great
a
lady
she
was
in
her
lowly
lot
and
how
she
thought
that
he
was
as
good
as
he
was
clever
then
of
his
sister
so
gracious
in
submission
to
her
fate
of
his
own
innocent
childhood
and
conscience
as
yet
unstained
of
budding
hopes
undespoiled
by
rough
winds
and
at
these
thoughts
the
past
broke
into
flowers
once
more
for
his
memory
then
he
told
himself
that
it
was
a
far
finer
thing
to
hew
his
own
way
through
serried
hostile
mobs
of
aristocrats
or
philistines
by
repeated
successful
strokes
than
to
reach
the
goal
through
a
woman
favor
sooner
or
later
his
genius
should
shine
out
it
had
been
so
with
the
others
his
predecessors
they
had
tamed
society
women
would
love
him
when
that
day
came
the
example
of
napoleon
which
unluckily
for
this
nineteenth
century
of
ours
has
filled
a
great
many
ordinary
persons
with
aspirations
after
extraordinary
destinies
the
example
of
napoleon
occurred
to
lucien
mind
he
flung
his
schemes
to
the
winds
and
blamed
himself
for
thinking
of
them
for
lucien
was
so
made
that
he
went
from
evil
to
good
or
from
good
to
evil
with
the
same
facility
lucien
had
none
of
the
scholar
love
for
his
retreat
for
the
past
month
indeed
he
had
felt
something
like
shame
at
the
sight
of
the
shop
front
where
you
could
read
postel
late
chardon
pharmaceutical
chemist
in
yellow
letters
on
a
green
ground
it
was
an
offence
to
him
that
his
father
name
should
be
thus
posted
up
in
a
place
where
every
carriage
passed
every
evening
when
he
closed
the
ugly
iron
gate
and
went
up
to
beaulieu
to
give
his
arm
to
mme
de
bargeton
among
the
dandies
of
the
upper
town
he
chafed
beyond
all
reason
at
the
disparity
between
his
lodging
and
his
fortune
i
love
mme
de
bargeton
perhaps
in
a
few
days
she
will
be
mine
yet
here
i
live
in
this
he
said
to
himself
this
evening
as
he
went
down
the
narrow
passage
into
the
little
yard
behind
the
shop
this
evening
bundles
of
boiled
herbs
were
spread
out
along
the
wall
the
apprentice
was
scouring
a
caldron
and
postel
himself
girded
about
with
his
laboratory
apron
was
standing
with
a
retort
in
his
hand
inspecting
some
chemical
product
while
keeping
an
eye
upon
the
shop
door
or
if
the
eye
happened
to
be
engaged
he
had
at
any
rate
an
ear
for
the
bell
a
strong
scent
of
camomile
and
peppermint
pervaded
the
yard
and
the
poor
little
dwelling
at
the
side
which
you
reached
by
a
short
ladder
with
a
rope
on
either
side
by
way
of
lucien
room
was
an
attic
just
under
the
roof
sonny
said
postel
that
typical
provincial
tradesman
are
you
pretty
middling
i
have
just
been
experimenting
on
treacle
but
it
would
take
a
man
like
your
father
to
find
what
i
am
looking
for
ah
he
was
a
famous
chemist
he
was
if
i
had
only
known
his
gout
specific
you
and
i
should
be
rolling
along
in
our
carriage
this
day
the
little
druggist
whose
head
was
as
thick
as
his
heart
was
kind
never
let
a
week
pass
without
some
allusion
to
chardon
unlucky
secretiveness
as
to
that
discovery
words
that
lucien
felt
like
a
stab
it
is
a
great
pity
lucien
answered
curtly
he
was
beginning
to
think
his
father
apprentice
prodigiously
vulgar
though
he
had
blessed
the
man
for
his
kindness
for
honest
postel
had
helped
his
master
widow
and
children
more
than
once
why
what
is
the
matter
with
you
postel
inquired
putting
down
his
test
tube
on
the
laboratory
table
is
there
a
letter
for
me
yes
a
letter
that
smells
like
balm
it
is
lying
on
the
corner
near
my
desk
mme
de
bargeton
letter
lying
among
the
physic
bottles
in
a
druggist
shop
lucien
sprang
in
to
rescue
it
be
quick
lucien
your
dinner
has
been
waiting
an
hour
for
you
it
will
be
cold
a
sweet
voice
called
gently
through
a
window
but
lucien
did
not
hear
that
brother
of
yours
has
gone
crazy
mademoiselle
said
postel
lifting
his
face
the
old
bachelor
looked
rather
like
a
miniature
brandy
cask
embellished
by
a
painter
fancy
with
a
fat
ruddy
countenance
much
pitted
with
the
smallpox
at
the
sight
of
eve
his
face
took
a
ceremonious
and
amiable
expression
which
said
plainly
that
he
had
thoughts
of
espousing
the
daughter
of
his
predecessor
but
could
not
put
an
end
to
the
strife
between
love
and
interest
in
his
heart
he
often
said
to
lucien
with
a
smile
your
sister
is
uncommonly
pretty
and
you
are
not
so
bad
looking
neither
your
father
did
everything
well
eve
was
tall
dark
of
complexion
and
but
notwithstanding
these
signs
of
virile
character
she
was
gentle
and
devoted
to
those
she
loved
her
frank
innocence
her
simplicity
her
quiet
acceptance
of
a
life
her
character
for
her
life
was
above
reproach
could
not
fail
to
win
david
sechard
heart
so
since
the
first
time
that
these
two
had
met
a
repressed
and
love
had
grown
up
between
them
in
the
german
fashion
quietly
with
no
fervid
protestations
in
their
secret
souls
they
thought
of
each
other
as
if
there
were
a
bar
between
that
kept
them
apart
as
if
the
thought
were
an
offence
against
some
jealous
husband
and
hid
their
feelings
from
lucien
as
though
their
love
in
some
way
did
him
a
wrong
david
moreover
had
no
confidence
in
himself
and
could
not
believe
that
eve
could
care
for
him
eve
was
a
penniless
girl
and
therefore
shy
a
real
would
have
been
bolder
but
eve
gently
bred
and
fallen
into
poverty
resigned
herself
to
her
dreary
lot
diffident
as
she
seemed
she
was
in
reality
proud
and
would
not
make
a
single
advance
towards
the
son
of
a
father
said
to
be
rich
people
who
knew
the
value
of
a
growing
property
said
that
the
vineyard
at
marsac
was
worth
more
than
eighty
thousand
francs
to
say
nothing
of
the
traditional
bits
of
land
which
old
sechard
used
to
buy
as
they
came
into
the
market
for
old
sechard
had
savings
he
was
lucky
with
his
vintages
and
a
clever
salesman
perhaps
david
was
the
only
man
in
angouleme
who
knew
nothing
of
his
father
wealth
in
david
eyes
marsac
was
a
hovel
bought
in
for
fifteen
or
sixteen
thousand
francs
a
place
that
he
saw
once
a
year
at
vintage
time
when
his
father
walked
him
up
and
down
among
the
vines
and
boasted
of
an
output
of
wine
which
the
young
printer
never
saw
and
he
cared
nothing
about
it
david
was
a
student
leading
a
solitary
life
and
the
love
that
gained
even
greater
force
in
solitude
as
he
dwelt
upon
the
difficulties
in
the
way
was
timid
and
looked
for
encouragement
for
david
stood
more
in
awe
of
eve
than
a
simple
clerk
of
some
lady
he
was
awkward
and
ill
at
ease
in
the
presence
of
his
idol
and
as
eager
to
hurry
away
as
he
had
been
to
come
he
repressed
his
passion
and
was
silent
often
of
an
evening
on
some
pretext
of
consulting
lucien
he
would
leave
the
place
du
murier
and
go
down
through
the
palet
gate
as
far
as
but
at
the
sight
of
the
green
iron
railings
his
heart
failed
perhaps
he
had
come
too
late
eve
might
think
him
a
nuisance
she
would
be
in
bed
by
this
time
no
doubt
and
so
he
turned
back
but
though
his
great
love
had
only
appeared
in
trifles
eve
read
it
clearly
she
was
proud
without
a
touch
of
vanity
in
her
pride
of
the
deep
reverence
in
david
looks
and
words
and
manner
towards
her
but
it
was
the
young
printer
enthusiastic
belief
in
lucien
that
drew
her
to
him
most
of
all
he
had
divined
the
way
to
win
eve
the
mute
delights
of
this
love
of
theirs
differed
from
the
transports
of
stormy
passion
as
wildflowers
in
the
fields
from
the
brilliant
flowers
in
garden
beds
interchange
of
glances
delicate
and
sweet
as
blue
on
the
surface
of
the
stream
a
look
in
either
face
vanishing
as
swiftly
as
the
scent
of
melancholy
tender
as
the
velvet
of
moss
these
were
the
blossoms
of
two
rare
natures
springing
up
out
of
a
rich
and
fruitful
soil
on
foundations
of
rock
many
a
time
eve
had
seen
revelations
of
the
strength
that
lay
below
the
appearance
of
weakness
and
made
such
full
allowance
for
all
that
david
left
undone
that
the
slightest
word
now
might
bring
about
a
closer
union
of
soul
and
soul
eve
opened
the
door
and
lucien
sat
down
without
a
word
at
the
little
table
on
an
trestle
there
was
no
tablecloth
the
poor
little
household
boasted
but
three
silver
spoons
and
forks
and
eve
had
laid
them
all
for
the
dearly
loved
brother
what
have
you
there
she
asked
when
she
had
set
a
dish
on
the
table
and
put
the
extinguisher
on
the
portable
stove
where
it
had
been
kept
hot
for
him
lucien
did
not
answer
eve
took
up
a
little
plate
daintily
garnished
with
and
set
it
on
the
table
with
a
jug
full
of
cream
there
lucien
i
have
had
strawberries
for
you
but
lucien
was
so
absorbed
in
his
letter
that
he
did
not
hear
a
word
eve
came
to
sit
beside
him
without
a
murmur
for
in
a
sister
love
for
a
brother
it
is
an
element
of
great
pleasure
to
be
treated
without
ceremony
oh
what
is
it
she
cried
as
she
saw
tears
shining
in
her
eyes
nothing
nothing
eve
he
said
and
putting
his
arm
about
her
waist
he
drew
her
towards
him
and
kissed
her
forehead
her
hair
her
throat
with
warmth
that
surprised
her
you
are
keeping
something
from
me
well
then
she
loves
me
i
knew
very
well
that
you
kissed
me
for
somebody
else
the
poor
sister
pouted
flushing
red
we
shall
all
be
happy
cried
lucien
swallowing
great
spoonfuls
of
soup
echoed
eve
the
same
presentiment
that
had
crossed
david
mind
prompted
her
to
add
you
will
not
care
so
much
about
us
now
how
can
you
think
that
if
you
know
me
eve
put
out
her
hand
and
grasped
his
tightly
then
she
carried
off
the
empty
plate
and
the
brown
earthen
and
brought
the
dish
that
she
had
made
for
him
but
instead
of
eating
his
dinner
lucien
read
his
letter
over
again
and
eve
discreet
maiden
did
not
ask
another
question
respecting
her
brother
silence
if
he
wished
to
tell
her
about
it
she
could
wait
if
he
did
not
how
could
she
ask
him
to
tell
her
she
waited
here
is
the
letter
my
friend
why
should
i
refuse
to
your
brother
in
science
the
help
that
i
have
lent
you
all
merits
have
equal
rights
in
my
eyes
but
you
do
not
know
the
prejudices
of
those
among
whom
i
live
we
shall
never
make
an
aristocracy
of
ignorance
understand
that
intellect
ennobles
if
i
have
not
sufficient
influence
to
compel
them
to
accept
david
sechard
i
am
quite
willing
to
sacrifice
the
worthless
creatures
to
you
it
would
be
a
perfect
hecatomb
in
the
antique
manner
but
dear
friend
you
would
not
of
course
ask
me
to
leave
them
all
in
exchange
for
the
society
of
a
person
whose
character
and
manner
might
not
please
me
i
know
from
your
flatteries
how
easily
friendship
can
be
blinded
will
you
think
the
worse
of
me
if
i
attach
a
condition
to
my
consent
in
the
interests
of
your
future
i
should
like
to
see
your
friend
and
know
and
decide
for
myself
whether
you
are
not
mistaken
what
is
this
but
the
mother
anxious
care
of
my
dear
poet
which
i
am
in
duty
bound
to
take
louise
de
negrepelisse
lucien
had
no
suspicion
of
the
art
with
which
polite
society
puts
forward
a
yes
on
the
way
to
a
no
and
a
no
that
leads
to
a
yes
he
took
this
note
for
a
victory
david
should
go
to
mme
de
bargeton
house
david
would
shine
there
in
all
the
majesty
of
his
genius
he
raised
his
head
so
proudly
in
the
intoxication
of
a
victory
which
increased
his
belief
in
himself
and
his
ascendency
over
others
his
face
was
so
radiant
with
the
brightness
of
many
hopes
that
his
sister
could
not
help
telling
him
that
he
looked
handsome
if
that
woman
has
any
sense
she
must
love
you
and
if
so
she
will
be
vexed
for
all
the
ladies
will
try
all
sorts
of
coquetries
on
you
how
handsome
you
will
look
when
you
read
your
john
in
if
only
i
were
a
mouse
and
could
just
slip
in
and
see
it
come
i
have
put
your
clothes
out
in
mother
room
the
mother
room
bore
witness
to
poverty
there
were
white
curtains
to
the
walnut
wood
bedstead
and
a
strip
of
cheap
green
carpet
at
the
foot
a
chest
of
drawers
with
a
wooden
top
a
and
a
few
walnut
wood
chairs
completed
the
furniture
the
clock
on
the
told
of
the
old
vanished
days
of
prosperity
white
curtains
hung
in
the
windows
a
gray
flowered
paper
covered
the
walls
and
the
tiled
floor
colored
and
waxed
by
eve
herself
shone
with
cleanliness
on
the
little
round
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
a
red
tray
with
a
pattern
of
gilt
roses
and
three
cups
and
a
of
limoges
porcelain
eve
slept
in
the
little
adjoining
closet
where
there
was
just
room
for
a
narrow
bed
an
low
chair
and
a
by
the
window
there
was
about
as
much
space
as
there
is
in
a
ship
cabin
and
the
door
always
stood
open
for
the
sake
of
air
but
if
all
these
things
spoke
of
great
poverty
the
atmosphere
was
sedate
and
studious
and
for
those
who
knew
the
mother
and
children
there
was
something
touchingly
appropriate
in
their
surroundings
lucien
was
tying
his
cravat
when
david
step
sounded
outside
in
the
little
yard
and
in
another
moment
the
young
printer
appeared
from
his
manner
and
looks
he
seemed
to
have
come
down
in
a
hurry
well
david
cried
the
ambitious
poet
we
have
gained
the
day
she
loves
me
you
shall
come
too
no
david
said
with
some
confusion
i
came
down
to
thank
you
for
this
proof
of
friendship
but
i
have
been
thinking
things
over
seriously
my
own
life
is
cut
out
for
me
lucien
i
am
david
sechard
printer
to
his
majesty
in
angouleme
with
my
name
at
the
bottom
of
the
bills
posted
on
every
wall
for
people
of
that
class
i
am
an
artisan
or
i
am
in
business
if
you
like
it
better
but
i
am
a
craftsman
who
lives
over
a
shop
in
the
rue
de
beaulieu
at
the
corner
of
the
place
du
murier
i
have
not
the
wealth
of
a
keller
just
yet
nor
the
name
of
a
desplein
two
sorts
of
power
that
the
nobles
still
try
to
ignore
and
i
am
so
far
agreed
with
them
this
power
is
nothing
without
a
knowledge
of
the
world
and
the
manners
of
a
gentleman
how
am
i
to
prove
my
claim
to
this
sudden
elevation
i
should
only
make
myself
a
for
nobles
and
to
boot
as
for
you
your
position
is
different
a
foreman
is
not
committed
to
anything
you
are
busy
gaining
knowledge
that
will
be
indispensable
by
and
by
you
can
explain
your
present
work
by
your
future
and
in
any
case
you
can
leave
your
place
and
begin
something
else
you
might
study
law
or
diplomacy
or
go
into
civil
service
nobody
had
docketed
and
in
fact
take
advantage
of
your
social
maiden
fame
to
walk
alone
and
grasp
honors
enjoy
all
pleasures
gladly
even
frivolous
pleasures
i
wish
you
luck
lucien
i
shall
enjoy
your
success
you
will
be
like
a
second
self
for
me
yes
in
my
own
thoughts
i
shall
live
your
life
you
shall
have
the
holiday
life
in
the
glare
of
the
world
and
among
the
swift
working
springs
of
intrigue
i
will
lead
the
life
the
tradesman
life
of
sober
toil
and
the
patient
labor
of
scientific
research
you
shall
be
our
aristocracy
he
went
on
looking
at
eve
as
he
spoke
if
you
totter
you
shall
have
my
arm
to
steady
you
if
you
have
reason
to
complain
of
the
treachery
of
others
you
will
find
a
refuge
in
our
hearts
the
love
there
will
never
change
and
influence
and
favor
and
the
goodwill
of
others
might
fail
us
if
we
were
two
we
should
stand
in
each
other
way
go
forward
you
can
tow
me
after
you
if
it
comes
to
that
so
far
from
envying
you
i
will
dedicate
my
life
to
yours
the
thing
that
you
have
just
done
for
me
when
you
risked
the
loss
of
your
benefactress
your
love
it
may
be
rather
than
forsake
or
disown
me
that
little
thing
so
great
as
it
was
ah
well
lucien
that
in
itself
would
bind
me
to
you
forever
if
we
were
not
brothers
already
have
no
remorse
no
concern
over
seeming
to
take
the
larger
share
this
bargain
is
exactly
to
my
taste
and
after
all
suppose
that
you
should
give
me
a
pang
now
and
again
who
knows
that
i
shall
not
still
be
your
debtor
all
my
life
long
he
looked
timidly
towards
eve
as
he
spoke
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
she
saw
all
that
lay
below
the
surface
in
fact
he
went
on
turning
to
lucien
who
stood
amazed
at
this
you
are
well
made
you
have
a
graceful
figure
you
wear
your
clothes
with
an
air
you
look
like
a
gentleman
in
that
blue
coat
of
yours
with
the
yellow
buttons
and
the
plain
nankeen
trousers
now
i
should
look
like
a
workingman
among
those
people
i
should
be
awkward
and
out
of
my
element
i
should
say
foolish
things
or
say
nothing
at
all
but
as
for
you
you
can
overcome
any
prejudice
as
to
names
by
taking
your
mother
you
can
call
yourself
lucien
de
rubempre
i
am
and
always
shall
be
david
sechard
in
this
society
that
you
frequent
everything
tells
for
you
everything
would
tell
against
me
you
were
born
to
shine
in
it
women
will
worship
that
angel
face
of
yours
wo
they
eve
lucien
sprang
up
and
flung
his
arms
about
david
david
humility
had
made
short
work
of
many
doubts
and
plenty
of
difficulties
was
it
possible
not
to
feel
twice
tenderly
towards
this
friend
who
by
the
way
of
friendship
had
come
to
think
the
very
thoughts
that
he
lucien
had
reached
through
ambition
the
aspirant
for
love
and
honors
felt
that
the
way
had
been
made
smooth
for
him
the
young
man
and
the
comrade
felt
all
his
heart
go
out
towards
his
friend
it
was
one
of
those
moments
that
come
very
seldom
in
our
lives
when
all
the
forces
in
us
are
sweetly
strung
and
every
chord
vibrating
gives
out
full
resonance
and
yet
this
goodness
of
a
noble
nature
increased
lucien
human
tendency
to
take
himself
as
the
centre
of
things
do
not
all
of
us
say
more
or
less
moi
with
louis
quatorze
mother
and
sister
had
concentrated
all
their
tenderness
on
him
david
was
his
devoted
friend
he
was
accustomed
to
see
the
three
making
every
effort
for
him
in
secret
and
consequently
he
had
all
the
faults
of
a
spoiled
eldest
son
the
noble
is
eaten
up
with
the
egoism
which
their
unselfishness
was
fostering
in
lucien
and
mme
de
bargeton
was
doing
her
best
to
develop
the
same
fault
by
inciting
him
to
forget
all
that
he
owed
to
his
sister
and
mother
and
david
he
was
far
from
doing
so
as
yet
but
was
there
not
ground
for
the
fear
that
as
his
sphere
of
ambition
widened
his
whole
thought
perforce
would
be
how
he
might
maintain
himself
in
it
when
emotion
had
subsided
david
had
a
suggestion
to
make
he
thought
that
lucien
poem
john
in
was
possibly
too
biblical
to
be
read
before
an
audience
but
little
familiar
with
apocalyptic
poetry
lucien
making
his
first
appearance
before
the
most
exacting
public
in
the
charente
seemed
to
be
nervous
david
advised
him
to
take
andre
de
chenier
and
substitute
certain
pleasure
for
a
dubious
delight
lucien
was
a
perfect
reader
the
listeners
would
enjoy
listening
to
him
and
his
modesty
would
doubtless
serve
him
well
like
most
young
people
the
pair
were
endowing
the
rest
of
the
world
with
their
own
intelligence
and
virtues
for
if
youth
that
has
not
yet
gone
astray
is
pitiless
for
the
sins
of
others
it
is
ready
on
the
other
hand
to
put
a
magnificent
faith
in
them
it
is
only
in
fact
after
a
good
deal
of
experience
of
life
that
we
recognize
the
truth
of
raphael
great
saying
to
comprehend
is
to
equal
the
power
of
appreciating
poetry
is
rare
generally
speaking
in
france
soon
dries
up
the
source
of
the
sacred
tears
of
ecstasy
nobody
cares
to
be
at
the
trouble
of
deciphering
the
sublime
of
plumbing
the
depths
to
discover
the
infinite
lucien
was
about
to
have
his
first
experience
of
the
ignorance
and
indifference
of
worldlings
he
went
round
by
way
of
the
printing
office
for
volume
of
poetry
the
two
lovers
were
left
alone
and
david
had
never
felt
more
embarrassed
in
his
life
countless
terrors
seized
upon
him
he
half
wished
half
feared
that
eve
would
praise
him
he
longed
to
run
away
for
even
modesty
is
not
exempt
from
coquetry
david
was
afraid
to
utter
a
word
that
might
seem
to
beg
for
thanks
everything
that
he
could
think
of
put
him
in
some
false
position
so
he
held
his
tongue
and
looked
guilty
eve
guessing
the
agony
of
modesty
was
enjoying
the
pause
but
when
david
twisted
his
hat
as
if
he
meant
to
go
she
looked
at
him
and
smiled
monsieur
david
she
said
if
you
are
not
going
to
pass
the
evening
at
mme
de
bargeton
we
can
spend
the
time
together
it
is
fine
shall
we
take
a
walk
along
the
charente
we
will
have
a
talk
about
lucien
david
longed
to
fling
himself
at
the
feet
of
this
delicious
girl
eve
had
rewarded
him
beyond
his
hopes
by
that
tone
in
her
voice
the
kindness
of
her
accent
had
solved
the
difficulties
of
the
position
her
suggestion
was
something
better
than
praise
it
was
the
first
grace
given
by
love
but
give
me
time
to
dress
she
said
as
david
made
as
if
to
go
at
once
david
went
out
he
who
all
his
life
long
had
not
known
one
tune
from
another
was
humming
to
himself
honest
postel
hearing
him
with
surprise
conceived
a
vehement
suspicion
of
eve
feelings
towards
the
printer
the
most
trifling
things
that
happened
that
evening
made
a
great
impression
on
lucien
and
his
character
was
peculiarly
susceptible
to
first
impressions
like
all
inexperienced
lovers
he
arrived
so
early
that
louise
was
not
in
the
but
de
bargeton
was
there
alone
lucien
had
already
begun
to
serve
his
apprenticeship
in
the
practice
of
the
small
deceits
with
which
the
lover
of
a
married
woman
pays
for
his
happiness
deceits
through
which
moreover
she
learns
the
extent
of
her
power
but
so
far
lucien
had
not
met
the
husband
face
to
face
de
bargeton
intellect
was
of
the
limited
kind
exactly
poised
on
the
border
line
between
harmless
vacancy
with
some
glimmerings
of
sense
and
the
excessive
stupidity
that
can
neither
take
in
nor
give
out
any
idea
he
was
thoroughly
impressed
with
the
idea
of
doing
his
duty
in
society
and
doing
his
utmost
to
be
agreeable
had
adopted
the
smile
of
an
opera
dancer
as
his
sole
method
of
expression
satisfied
he
smiled
dissatisfied
he
smiled
again
he
smiled
at
good
news
and
evil
tidings
with
slight
modifications
the
smile
did
duty
on
all
occasions
if
he
was
positively
obliged
to
express
his
personal
approval
a
complacent
laugh
reinforced
the
smile
but
he
never
vouchsafed
a
word
until
driven
to
the
last
extremity
a
put
him
in
the
one
embarrassment
of
his
vegetative
existence
for
then
he
was
obliged
to
look
for
something
to
say
in
the
vast
blank
of
his
vacant
interior
he
usually
got
out
of
the
difficulty
by
a
return
to
the
artless
ways
of
childhood
he
thought
aloud
took
you
into
his
confidence
concerning
the
smallest
details
of
his
existence
his
physical
wants
the
small
sensations
which
did
duty
for
ideas
with
him
he
never
talked
about
the
weather
nor
did
he
indulge
in
the
ordinary
commonplaces
of
conversation
the
way
of
escape
provided
for
weak
intellects
he
plunged
you
into
the
most
intimate
and
personal
topics
i
took
veal
this
morning
to
please
mme
de
bargeton
who
is
very
fond
of
veal
and
my
stomach
has
been
very
uneasy
since
he
would
tell
you
i
knew
how
it
would
be
it
never
suits
me
how
do
you
explain
it
or
very
likely
i
am
just
about
to
ring
for
a
glass
of
will
you
have
some
at
the
same
time
or
i
am
going
to
take
a
ride
i
am
going
over
to
see
my
these
short
observations
did
not
permit
of
discussion
a
yes
or
no
extracted
from
his
interlocutor
the
conversation
dropped
dead
then
de
bargeton
mutely
implored
his
visitor
to
come
to
his
assistance
turning
westward
his
old
asthmatic
countenance
he
gazed
at
you
with
big
lustreless
eyes
in
a
way
that
said
you
were
saying
the
people
whom
he
loved
best
were
bores
anxious
to
talk
about
themselves
he
listened
to
them
with
an
unfeigned
and
delicate
interest
which
so
endeared
him
to
the
species
that
all
the
twaddlers
of
angouleme
credited
de
bargeton
with
more
understanding
than
he
chose
to
show
and
were
of
the
opinion
that
he
was
underrated
so
it
happened
that
when
these
persons
could
find
nobody
else
to
listen
to
them
they
went
off
to
give
de
bargeton
the
benefit
of
the
rest
of
the
story
argument
or
what
not
sure
beforehand
of
his
eulogistic
smile
madame
de
bargeton
rooms
were
always
crowded
and
generally
her
husband
felt
quite
at
ease
he
interested
himself
in
the
smallest
details
he
watched
those
who
came
in
and
bowed
and
smiled
and
brought
the
new
arrivals
to
his
wife
he
lay
in
wait
for
departing
visitors
and
went
with
them
to
the
door
taking
leave
of
them
with
that
eternal
smile
when
conversation
grew
lively
and
he
saw
that
every
one
was
interested
in
one
thing
or
another
he
stood
happy
and
mute
planted
like
a
swan
on
both
feet
listening
to
all
appearance
to
a
political
discussion
or
he
looked
over
the
hands
without
a
notion
of
what
it
was
all
about
for
he
could
not
play
at
any
game
or
he
walked
about
and
took
snuff
to
promote
digestion
anais
was
the
bright
side
of
his
life
she
made
it
unspeakably
pleasant
for
him
stretched
out
at
full
length
in
his
armchair
he
watched
admiringly
while
she
did
her
part
as
hostess
for
she
talked
for
him
it
was
a
pleasure
too
to
him
to
try
to
see
the
point
in
her
remarks
and
as
it
was
often
a
good
while
before
he
succeeded
his
smiles
appeared
after
a
delay
like
the
explosion
of
a
shell
which
has
entered
the
earth
and
worked
up
again
his
respect
for
his
wife
moreover
almost
amounted
to
adoration
and
so
long
as
we
can
adore
is
there
not
happiness
enough
in
life
anais
husband
was
as
docile
as
a
child
who
asks
nothing
better
than
to
be
told
what
to
do
and
generous
and
clever
woman
as
she
was
she
had
taken
no
undue
advantage
of
his
weaknesses
she
had
taken
care
of
him
as
you
take
care
of
a
cloak
she
kept
him
brushed
neat
and
tidy
looked
closely
after
him
and
humored
him
and
humored
looked
after

kept
tidy
and
cared
for
de
bargeton
had
come
to
feel
an
almost
affection
for
his
wife
it
is
so
easy
to
give
happiness
that
costs
nothing
mme
de
bargeton
knowing
that
her
husband
had
no
pleasure
but
in
good
cheer
saw
that
he
had
good
dinners
she
had
pity
upon
him
she
had
never
uttered
a
word
of
complaint
indeed
there
were
people
who
could
not
understand
that
a
woman
might
keep
silence
through
pride
and
argued
that
de
bargeton
must
possess
good
qualities
hidden
from
public
view
mme
de
bargeton
had
drilled
him
into
military
subordination
he
yielded
a
passive
obedience
to
his
wife
go
and
call
on
monsieur
or
madame
she
would
say
and
he
went
forthwith
like
a
soldier
at
the
word
of
command
he
stood
at
attention
in
her
presence
and
waited
motionless
for
his
orders
there
was
some
talk
about
this
time
of
nominating
the
mute
gentleman
for
a
deputy
lucien
as
yet
had
not
lifted
the
veil
which
hid
such
an
unimaginable
character
indeed
he
had
scarcely
frequented
the
house
long
enough
de
bargeton
spread
at
full
length
in
his
great
chair
appeared
to
see
and
understand
all
that
was
going
on
his
silence
added
to
his
dignity
and
his
figure
inspired
lucien
with
a
prodigious
awe
it
is
the
wont
of
imaginative
natures
to
magnify
everything
or
to
find
a
soul
to
inhabit
every
shape
and
lucien
took
this
gentleman
not
for
a
granite
but
for
a
formidable
sphinx
and
thought
it
necessary
to
conciliate
him
i
am
the
first
comer
he
said
bowing
with
more
respect
than
people
usually
showed
the
worthy
man
that
is
natural
enough
said
de
bargeton
lucien
took
the
remark
for
an
epigram
the
lady
husband
was
jealous
he
thought
he
reddened
under
it
looked
in
the
glass
and
tried
to
give
himself
a
countenance
you
live
in
said
de
bargeton
and
people
who
live
a
long
way
off
always
come
earlier
than
those
who
live
near
by
what
is
the
reason
of
that
asked
lucien
politely
i
do
know
answered
de
bargeton
relapsing
into
immobility
you
have
not
cared
to
find
out
lucien
began
again
any
one
who
could
make
an
observation
could
discover
the
cause
ah
said
de
bargeton
final
causes
eh
eh
the
conversation
came
to
a
dead
stop
lucien
racked
his
brains
to
resuscitate
it
mme
de
bargeton
is
dressing
no
doubt
he
began
shuddering
at
the
silliness
of
the
question
yes
she
is
dressing
her
husband
naturally
answered
lucien
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
and
vainly
tried
to
think
of
something
else
to
say
as
his
eyes
wandered
over
the
gray
painted
joists
and
the
spaces
of
plaster
between
he
saw
not
without
qualms
that
the
little
chandelier
with
the
pendants
had
been
stripped
of
its
gauze
covering
and
filled
with
wax
candles
all
the
covers
had
been
removed
from
the
furniture
and
the
faded
flowered
silk
damask
had
come
to
light
these
preparations
meant
something
extraordinary
the
poet
looked
at
his
boots
and
misgivings
about
his
costume
arose
in
his
mind
grown
stupid
with
dismay
he
turned
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
a
japanese
jar
standing
on
a
begarlanded
console
table
of
the
time
of
louis
quinze
then
recollecting
that
he
must
conciliate
mme
de
bargeton
husband
he
tried
to
find
out
if
the
good
gentleman
had
a
hobby
of
any
sort
in
which
he
might
be
humored
you
seldom
leave
the
city
monsieur
he
began
returning
to
de
bargeton
very
seldom
silence
again
de
bargeton
watched
lucien
slightest
movements
like
a
suspicious
cat
the
young
man
presence
disturbed
him
each
was
afraid
of
the
other
can
he
feel
suspicious
of
my
attentions
thought
lucien
he
seems
to
be
anything
but
friendly
lucien
was
not
a
little
embarrassed
by
the
uneasy
glances
that
the
other
gave
him
as
he
went
to
and
fro
when
luckily
for
him
the
old
who
wore
livery
for
the
occasion
announced
du
chatelet
the
baron
came
in
very
much
at
ease
greeted
his
friend
bargeton
and
favored
lucien
with
the
little
nod
then
in
vogue
which
the
poet
in
his
mind
called
impertinence
sixte
du
chatelet
appeared
in
a
pair
of
dazzling
white
trousers
with
invisible
straps
that
kept
them
in
shape
he
wore
pumps
and
thread
stockings
the
black
ribbon
of
his
eyeglass
meandered
over
a
white
waistcoat
and
the
fashion
and
elegance
of
paris
was
strikingly
apparent
in
his
black
coat
he
was
indeed
just
the
faded
beau
who
might
be
expected
from
his
antecedents
though
advancing
years
had
already
endowed
him
with
a
certain
which
somewhat
exceeded
the
limits
of
elegance
he
had
dyed
the
hair
and
whiskers
grizzled
by
his
sufferings
during
his
travels
and
this
gave
a
hard
look
to
his
face
the
skin
which
had
once
been
so
delicate
had
been
tanned
to
the
color
of
europeans
from
india
but
in
spite
of
his
absurd
pretensions
to
youth
you
could
still
discern
traces
of
the
imperial
highness
charming
private
secretary
in
du
chatelet
general
appearance
he
put
up
his
eyeglass
and
stared
at
his
rival
nankeen
trousers
at
his
boots
at
his
waistcoat
at
the
blue
coat
made
by
the
angouleme
tailor
he
looked
him
over
from
head
to
foot
in
short
then
he
coolly
returned
his
eyeglass
to
his
waistcoat
pocket
with
a
gesture
that
said
i
am
satisfied
and
lucien
eclipsed
at
this
moment
by
the
elegance
of
the
inland
revenue
department
thought
that
it
would
be
his
turn
by
and
by
when
he
should
turn
a
face
lighted
up
with
poetry
upon
the
assembly
but
this
prospect
did
not
prevent
him
from
feeling
the
sharp
pang
that
succeeded
to
the
uncomfortable
sense
of
de
bargeton
imagined
hostility
the
baron
seemed
to
bring
all
the
weight
of
his
fortune
to
bear
upon
him
the
better
to
humiliate
him
in
his
poverty
de
bargeton
had
counted
on
having
no
more
to
say
and
his
soul
was
dismayed
by
the
pause
spent
by
the
rivals
in
mutual
survey
he
had
a
question
which
he
kept
for
desperate
emergencies
laid
up
in
his
mind
as
it
were
against
a
rainy
day
now
was
the
proper
time
to
bring
it
out
well
monsieur
he
said
looking
at
chatelet
with
an
important
air
is
there
anything
fresh
anything
that
people
are
talking
about
why
the
latest
thing
is
chardon
chatelet
said
maliciously
ask
him
have
you
brought
some
charming
poet
for
us
inquired
the
vivacious
baron
adjusting
the
side
curl
that
had
gone
astray
on
his
temple
i
should
have
asked
you
whether
i
had
succeeded

answered
you
have
been
before
me
in
the
field
of
verse
pshaw
said
the
other

few
vaudevilles
well
enough
in
their
way
written
to
oblige

song
now
and
again
to
suit
some
occasion

good
without
the
music
and
my
long
epistle
to

ungrateful
that
he
was

not
hand
down
my
name
to
posterity
at
this
moment
mme
de
bargeton
appeared
in
all
the
glory
of
an
elaborate
toilette
she
wore
a
jewess
turban
enriched
with
an
eastern
clasp
the
cameos
on
her
neck
gleamed
through
the
gauze
scarf
gracefully
wound
about
her
shoulders
the
sleeves
of
her
printed
muslin
dress
were
short
so
as
to
display
a
series
of
bracelets
on
her
shapely
white
arms
lucien
was
charmed
with
this
theatrical
style
of
dress
du
chatelet
gallantly
plied
the
queen
with
fulsome
compliments
that
made
her
smile
with
pleasure
she
was
so
glad
to
be
praised
in
lucien
hearing
but
she
scarcely
gave
her
dear
poet
a
glance
and
met
chatelet
with
a
mortifying
civility
that
kept
him
at
a
distance
by
this
time
the
guests
began
to
arrive
first
and
foremost
appeared
the
bishop
and
his
dignified
and
reverend
figures
both
though
no
two
men
could
well
be
more
unlike
his
lordship
being
tall
and
attenuated
and
his
acolyte
short
and
fat
both
churchmen
eyes
were
bright
but
while
the
bishop
was
pallid
his
countenance
glowed
with
high
health
both
were
impassive
and
gesticulated
but
little
both
appeared
to
be
prudent
men
and
their
silence
and
reserve
were
supposed
to
hide
great
intellectual
powers
close
upon
the
two
ecclesiastics
followed
mme
de
chandour
and
her
husband
a
couple
so
extraordinary
that
those
who
are
unfamiliar
with
provincial
life
might
be
tempted
to
think
that
such
persons
are
purely
imaginary
amelie

chandour
posed
as
the
rival
queen
of
angouleme
her
husband
de
chandour
known
in
the
circle
as
stanislas
was
a
young
man
slim
still
at
with
a
countenance
like
a
sieve
his
cravat
was
always
tied
so
as
to
present
two
menacing
points
one
spike
reached
the
height
of
his
right
ear
the
other
pointed
downwards
to
the
red
ribbon
of
his
cross
his
were
violently
at
strife
a
waistcoat
displayed
the
ample
swelling
curves
of
a
shirt
fastened
by
massive
gold
studs
his
dress
in
fact
was
exaggerated
till
he
looked
almost
like
a
living
caricature
which
no
one
could
behold
for
the
first
time
with
gravity
stanislas
looked
himself
over
from
top
to
toe
with
a
kind
of
satisfaction
he
verified
the
number
of
his
waistcoat
buttons
and
followed
the
curving
outlines
of
his
trousers
with
fond
glances
that
came
to
a
standstill
at
last
on
the
pointed
tips
of
his
shoes
when
he
ceased
to
contemplate
himself
in
this
way
he
looked
towards
the
nearest
mirror
to
see
if
his
hair
still
kept
in
curl
then
sticking
a
finger
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
he
looked
about
him
at
the
women
with
happy
eyes
flinging
his
head
back
in
profile
with
all
the
airs
of
a
king
of
the
airs
which
were
prodigiously
admired
by
the
aristocratic
circle
of
which
he
was
the
beau
there
was
a
strain
of
eighteenth
century
grossness
as
a
rule
in
his
talk
a
detestable
kind
of
conversation
which
procured
him
some
success
with
women
he
made
them
laugh
du
chatelet
was
beginning
to
give
this
gentleman
some
uneasiness
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
since
mme
de
bargeton
had
taken
him
up
the
lively
interest
taken
by
the
women
in
the
byron
of
angouleme
was
distinctly
on
the
increase
his
coxcomb
superciliousness
tickled
their
curiosity
he
posed
as
the
man
whom
nothing
can
arouse
from
his
apathy
and
his
jaded
sultan
airs
were
like
a
challenge
amelie
de

short
plump
and
was
a
poor
actress
her
voice
was
loud
like
everything
else
about
her
her
head
with
its
load
of
feathers
in
winter
and
flowers
in
summer
was
never
still
for
a
moment
she
had
a
fine
flow
of
conversation
though
she
could
never
bring
a
sentence
to
an
end
without
a
wheezing
accompaniment
from
an
asthma
to
which
she
would
not
confess

astolphe
president
of
the
agricultural
society
a
tall
stout
personage
usually
appeared
in
the
wake
of
his
wife
elisa
a
lady
with
a
countenance
like
a
withered
fern
called
lili
by
her
friends
a
baby
name
singularly
at
variance
with
its
owner
character
and
demeanor
mme
de
saintot
was
a
solemn
and
extremely
pious
woman
and
a
very
trying
partner
at
a
game
of
cards
astolphe
was
supposed
to
be
a
scientific
man
of
the
first
rank
he
was
as
ignorant
as
a
carp
but
he
had
compiled
the
articles
on
sugar
and
brandy
for
a
dictionary
of
agriculture
by
wholesale
plunder
of
newspaper
articles
and
pillage
of
previous
writers
it
was
believed
all
over
the
department
that
saintot
was
engaged
upon
a
treatise
on
modern
husbandry
but
though
he
locked
himself
into
his
study
every
morning
he
had
not
written
a
couple
of
pages
in
a
dozen
years
if
anybody
called
to
see
him
he
always
contrived
to
be
discovered
rummaging
among
his
papers
hunting
for
a
stray
note
or
mending
a
pen
but
he
spent
the
whole
time
in
his
study
on
puerilities
reading
the
newspaper
through
from
end
to
end
cutting
figures
out
of
corks
with
his
penknife
and
drawing
patterns
on
his
he
would
turn
over
the
leaves
of
his
cicero
to
see
if
anything
applicable
to
the
events
of
the
day
might
catch
his
eye
and
drag
his
quotation
by
the
heels
into
the
conversation
that
evening
saying
there
is
a
passage
in
cicero
which
might
have
been
written
to
suit
modern
times
and
out
came
his
phrase
to
the
astonishment
of
his
audience
really
they
said
among
themselves
astolphe
is
a
well
of
learning
the
interesting
fact
circulated
all
over
the
town
and
sustained
the
general
belief
in
de
saintot
abilities
after
this
pair
came
de
bartas
known
as
adrien
among
the
circle
it
was
de
bartas
who
boomed
out
his
song
in
a
bass
voice
and
made
prodigious
claims
to
musical
knowledge
his
had
taken
a
stand
upon
solfeggi
he
began
by
admiring
his
appearance
while
he
sang
passed
thence
to
talking
about
music
and
finally
to
talking
of
nothing
else
his
musical
tastes
had
become
a
monomania
he
grew
animated
only
on
the
one
subject
of
music
he
was
miserable
all
evening
until
somebody
begged
him
to
sing
when
he
had
bellowed
one
of
his
airs
he
revived
again
strutted
about
raised
himself
on
his
heels
and
received
compliments
with
a
deprecating
air
but
modesty
did
not
prevent
him
from
going
from
group
to
group
for
his
meed
of
praise
and
when
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
about
the
singer
he
returned
to
the
subject
of
the
song
discussing
its
difficulties
or
extolling
the
composer
alexandre
de
brebian
performed
heroic
exploits
in
sepia
he
disfigured
the
walls
of
his
friends
rooms
with
a
swarm
of
crude
productions
and
spoiled
all
the
albums
in
the
department
alexandre
de
brebian
and
de
bartas
came
together
each
with
his
friend
wife
on
his
arm
a
arrangement
which
gossip
declared
to
be
carried
out
to
the
fullest
extent
as
for
the
two
women
mesdames
charlotte
de
brebian
and
josephine
de
bartas
or
lolotte
and
fifine
as
they
were
called
both
took
an
equal
interest
in
a
scarf
or
the
trimming
of
a
dress
or
the
reconciliation
of
several
irreconcilable
colors
both
were
eaten
up
with
a
desire
to
look
like
parisiennes
and
neglected
their
homes
where
everything
went
wrong
but
if
they
dressed
like
dolls
in
gowns
of
home
manufacture
and
exhibited
outrageous
combinations
of
crude
colors
upon
their
persons
their
husbands
availed
themselves
of
the
artist
privilege
and
dressed
as
they
pleased
and
curious
it
was
to
see
the
provincial
dowdiness
of
the
pair
in
their
threadbare
clothes
they
looked
like
the
supernumeraries
that
represent
rank
and
fashion
at
stage
weddings
in
theatres
one
of
the
queerest
figures
in
the
rooms
was
le
comte
de
senonches
known
by
the
aristocratic
name
of
jacques
a
mighty
hunter
lean
and
sunburned
a
haughty
gentleman
about
as
amiable
as
a
wild
boar
as
suspicious
as
a
venetian
and
jealous
as
a
moor
who
lived
on
terms
of
the
friendliest
and
most
perfect
intimacy
with
du
hautoy
otherwise
francis
the
friend
of
the
house
madame
de
senonches
zephirine
was
a
tall
woman
though
her
complexion
was
spoiled
already
by
pimples
due
to
liver
complaint
on
which
grounds
she
was
said
to
be
exacting
with
a
slender
figure
and
delicate
proportions
she
could
afford
to
indulge
in
languid
manners
savoring
somewhat
of
affectation
but
revealing
passion
and
the
consciousness
that
every
least
caprice
will
be
gratified
by
love
francis
the
house
friend
was
rather
he
had
given
up
his
consulship
in
valence
and
sacrificed
his
diplomatic
prospects
to
live
near
zephirine
also
known
as
zizine
in
angouleme
he
had
taken
the
household
in
charge
he
superintended
the
education
taught
them
foreign
languages
and
looked
after
the
fortunes
of
and
mme
de
senonches
with
the
most
complete
devotion
noble
angouleme
administrative
angouleme
and
angouleme
alike
had
looked
askance
for
a
long
while
at
this
phenomenon
of
the
perfect
union
of
three
persons
but
finally
the
mysterious
conjugal
trinity
appeared
to
them
so
rare
and
pleasing
a
spectacle
that
if
du
hautoy
had
shown
any
intention
of
marrying
he
would
have
been
thought
monstrously
immoral
mme
de
senonches
however
had
a
lady
companion
a
goddaughter
and
her
excessive
attachment
to
this
mlle
de
la
haye
was
beginning
to
raise
surmises
of
disquieting
mysteries
it
was
thought
in
spite
of
some
impossible
discrepancies
in
dates
that
francoise
de
la
haye
bore
a
striking
likeness
to
francis
du
hautoy
when
jacques
was
shooting
in
the
neighborhood
people
used
to
inquire
after
francis
and
jacques
would
discourse
on
his
little
ailments
and
talk
of
his
wife
in
the
second
place
so
curious
did
this
blindness
seem
in
a
man
of
jealous
temper
that
his
greatest
friends
used
to
draw
him
out
on
the
topic
for
the
amusement
of
others
who
did
not
know
of
the
mystery
du
hautoy
was
a
finical
dandy
whose
minute
care
of
himself
had
degenerated
into
mincing
affectation
and
childishness
he
took
an
interest
in
his
cough
his
appetite
his
digestion
his
night
rest
zephirine
had
succeeded
in
making
a
valetudinarian
of
her
factotum
she
coddled
him
and
doctored
him
she
crammed
him
with
delicate
fare
as
if
he
had
been
a
fine
she
embroidered
waistcoats
for
him
and
and
cravats
until
he
became
so
used
to
wearing
finery
that
she
transformed
him
into
a
kind
of
japanese
idol
their
understanding
was
perfect
in
season
and
out
of
season
zizine
consulted
francis
with
a
look
and
francis
seemed
to
take
his
ideas
from
zizine
eyes
they
frowned
and
smiled
together
and
seemingly
took
counsel
of
each
other
before
making
the
simplest
commonplace
remark
the
largest
landowner
in
the
neighborhood
a
man
whom
every
one
envied
was
the
marquis
de
pimentel
he
and
his
wife
between
them
had
an
income
of
forty
thousand
livres
and
spent
their
winters
in
paris
this
evening
they
had
driven
into
angouleme
in
their
caleche
and
had
brought
their
neighbors
the
baron
and
baroness
de
rastignac
and
their
party
the
baroness
aunt
and
daughters
two
charming
young
ladies
penniless
girls
who
had
been
carefully
brought
up
and
were
dressed
in
the
simple
way
that
sets
off
natural
loveliness
these
personages
beyond
question
the
first
in
the
company
met
with
a
reception
of
chilling
silence
the
respect
paid
to
them
was
full
of
jealousy
especially
as
everybody
saw
that
mme
de
bargeton
paid
marked
attention
to
the
guests
the
two
families
belonged
to
the
very
small
minority
who
hold
themselves
aloof
from
provincial
gossip
belong
to
no
clique
live
quietly
in
retirement
and
maintain
a
dignified
reserve
de
pimentel
and
de
rastignac
for
instance
were
addressed
by
their
names
in
full
and
no
length
of
acquaintance
had
brought
their
wives
and
daughters
into
the
select
coterie
of
angouleme
both
families
were
too
nearly
connected
with
the
court
to
compromise
themselves
through
provincial
follies
the
prefect
and
the
general
in
command
of
the
garrison
were
the
last
comers
and
with
them
came
the
country
gentleman
who
had
brought
the
treatise
on
silkworms
to
david
that
very
morning
evidently
he
was
the
mayor
of
some
canton
or
other
and
a
fine
estate
was
his
sufficient
title
to
gentility
but
from
his
appearance
it
was
plain
that
he
was
quite
unused
to
polite
society
he
looked
uneasy
in
his
clothes
he
was
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
do
with
his
hands
he
shifted
about
from
one
foot
to
another
as
he
spoke
and
half
rose
and
sat
down
again
when
anybody
spoke
to
him
he
seemed
ready
to
do
some
menial
service
he
was
obsequious
nervous
and
grave
by
turns
laughing
eagerly
at
every
joke
listening
with
servility
and
occasionally
imagining
that
people
were
laughing
at
him
he
assumed
a
knowing
air
his
treatise
weighed
upon
his
mind
again
and
again
he
tried
to
talk
about
silkworms
but
the
luckless
wight
happened
first
upon
de
bartas
who
talked
music
in
reply
and
next
on
de
saintot
who
quoted
cicero
to
him
and
not
until
the
evening
was
half
over
did
the
mayor
meet
with
sympathetic
listeners
in
mme
and
mlle
du
brossard
a
widowed
gentlewoman
and
her
daughter
mme
and
mlle
du
brossard
were
not
the
least
interesting
persons
in
the
clique
but
their
story
may
be
told
in
a
single
phrase
they
were
as
poor
as
they
were
noble
in
their
dress
there
was
just
that
tinge
of
pretension
which
betrayed
carefully
hidden
penury
the
daughter
a
big
heavy
young
woman
of
was
supposed
to
be
a
good
performer
on
the
piano
and
her
mother
praised
her
in
season
and
out
of
season
in
the
clumsiest
way
no
eligible
man
had
any
taste
which
camille
did
not
share
on
her
mother
authoritative
statement
mme
du
brossard
in
her
anxiety
to
establish
her
child
was
capable
of
saying
that
her
dear
camille
liked
nothing
so
much
as
a
roving
life
from
one
garrison
to
another
and
before
the
evening
was
out
that
she
was
sure
her
dear
camille
liked
a
quiet
country
farmhouse
existence
of
all
things
mother
and
daughter
had
the
pinched
dignity
characteristic
of
those
who
have
learned
by
experience
the
exact
value
of
expressions
of
sympathy
they
belonged
to
a
class
which
the
world
delights
to
pity
they
had
been
the
objects
of
the
benevolent
interest
of
egoism
they
had
sounded
the
empty
void
beneath
the
consoling
formulas
with
which
the
world
ministers
to
the
necessities
of
the
unfortunate
de
severac
was
years
old
and
a
childless
widower
mother
and
daughter
listened
therefore
with
devout
admiration
to
all
that
he
told
them
about
his
silkworm
nurseries
my
daughter
has
always
been
fond
of
animals
said
the
mother
and
as
women
are
especially
interested
in
the
silk
which
the
little
creatures
produce
i
shall
ask
permission
to
go
over
to
severac
so
that
my
camille
may
see
how
the
silk
is
spun
my
camille
is
so
intelligent
she
will
grasp
anything
that
you
tell
her
in
a
moment
did
she
not
understand
one
day
the
inverse
ratio
of
the
squares
of
distances
this
was
the
remark
that
brought
the
conversation
between
mme
du
brossard
and
de
severac
to
a
glorious
close
after
lucien
reading
that
night
a
few
habitues
slipped
in
familiarly
among
the
rest
so
did
one
or
two
eldest
sons
shy
mute
young
men
tricked
out
in
gorgeous
jewelry
and
highly
honored
by
an
invitation
to
this
literary
solemnity
the
boldest
men
among
them
so
far
shook
off
the
weight
of
awe
as
to
chatter
a
good
deal
with
mlle
de
la
haye
the
women
solemnly
arranged
themselves
in
a
circle
and
the
men
stood
behind
them
it
was
a
quaint
assemblage
of
wrinkled
countenances
and
heterogeneous
costumes
but
none
the
less
it
seemed
very
alarming
to
lucien
and
his
heart
beat
fast
when
he
felt
that
every
one
was
looking
at
him
his
assurance
bore
the
ordeal
with
some
difficulty
in
spite
of
the
encouraging
example
of
mme
de
bargeton
who
welcomed
the
most
illustrious
personages
of
angouleme
with
ostentatious
courtesy
and
elaborate
graciousness
and
the
uncomfortable
feeling
that
oppressed
him
was
aggravated
by
a
trifling
matter
which
any
one
might
have
foreseen
though
it
was
bound
to
come
as
an
unpleasant
shock
to
a
young
man
with
so
little
experience
of
the
world
lucien
all
eyes
and
ears
noticed
that
no
one
except
louise
de
bargeton
the
bishop
and
some
few
who
wished
to
please
the
mistress
of
the
house
spoke
of
him
as
de
rubempre
for
his
formidable
audience
he
was
chardon
courage
sank
under
their
inquisitive
eyes
he
could
read
his
plebeian
name
in
the
mere
movements
of
their
lips
and
hear
the
anticipatory
criticisms
made
in
the
blunt
provincial
fashion
that
too
often
borders
on
rudeness
he
had
not
expected
this
prolonged
ordeal
of
it
put
him
still
more
out
of
humor
with
himself
he
grew
impatient
to
begin
the
reading
for
then
he
could
assume
an
attitude
which
should
put
an
end
to
his
mental
torments
but
jacques
was
giving
mme
de
pimentel
the
history
of
his
last
day
sport
adrien
was
holding
forth
to
mlle
laure
de
rastignac
on
rossini
the
music
star
and
astolphe
who
had
got
by
heart
a
newspaper
paragraph
on
a
patent
plow
was
giving
the
baron
the
benefit
of
the
description
lucien
luckless
poet
that
he
was
did
not
know
that
there
was
scarce
a
soul
in
the
room
besides
mme
de
bargeton
who
could
understand
poetry
the
whole
assembly
was
there
by
a
misapprehension
nor
did
they
for
the
most
part
know
what
they
had
come
out
for
to
see
there
are
some
words
that
draw
a
public
as
unfailingly
as
the
clash
of
cymbals
the
trumpet
or
the
big
drum
beauty
glory
poetry
are
words
that
bewitch
the
coarsest
intellect
when
every
one
had
arrived
when
the
buzz
of
talk
ceased
after
repeated
efforts
on
the
part
of
de
bargeton
who
obedient
to
his
wife
went
round
the
room
much
as
the
beadle
makes
the
circle
of
the
church
tapping
the
pavement
with
his
wand
when
silence
in
fact
was
at
last
secured
lucien
went
to
the
round
table
near
mme
de
bargeton
a
fierce
thrill
of
excitement
ran
through
him
as
he
did
so
he
announced
in
an
uncertain
voice
that
to
prevent
disappointment
he
was
about
to
read
the
masterpieces
of
a
great
poet
discovered
only
recently
for
although
andre
de
chenier
poems
appeared
in
no
one
in
angouleme
had
so
much
as
heard
of
him
everybody
interpreted
this
announcement
in
one
way
it
was
a
shift
of
mme
de
bargeton
meant
to
save
the
poet
and
to
put
the
audience
at
ease
lucien
began
with
and
the
poem
was
received
with
a
murmur
of
applause
but
he
followed
it
with
which
proved
too
great
a
strain
upon
the
average
intellect
none
but
artists
or
those
endowed
with
the
artistic
temperament
can
understand
and
sympathize
with
him
in
the
diabolical
torture
of
that
reading
if
poetry
is
to
be
rendered
by
the
voice
and
if
the
listener
is
to
grasp
all
that
it
means
the
most
devout
attention
is
essential
there
should
be
an
intimate
alliance
between
the
reader
and
his
audience
or
swift
and
subtle
communication
of
the
poet
thought
and
feeling
becomes
impossible
here
this
close
sympathy
was
lacking
and
lucien
in
consequence
was
in
the
position
of
an
angel
who
should
endeavor
to
sing
of
heaven
amid
the
chucklings
of
hell
an
intelligent
man
in
the
sphere
most
stimulating
to
his
faculties
can
see
in
every
direction
like
a
snail
he
has
the
keen
scent
of
a
dog
the
ears
of
a
mole
he
can
hear
and
feel
and
see
all
that
is
going
on
around
him
a
musician
or
a
poet
knows
at
once
whether
his
audience
is
listening
in
admiration
or
fails
to
follow
him
and
feels
it
as
the
plant
that
revives
or
droops
under
favorable
or
unfavorable
conditions
the
men
who
had
come
with
their
wives
had
fallen
to
discussing
their
own
affairs
by
the
acoustic
law
before
mentioned
every
murmur
rang
in
lucien
ear
he
saw
all
the
gaps
caused
by
the
spasmodic
workings
of
jaws
sympathetically
affected
the
teeth
that
seemed
to
grin
defiance
at
him
when
like
the
dove
in
the
deluge
he
looked
round
for
any
spot
on
which
his
eyes
might
rest
he
saw
nothing
but
rows
of
impatient
faces
their
owners
clearly
were
waiting
for
him
to
make
an
end
they
had
come
together
to
discuss
questions
of
practical
interest
with
the
exceptions
of
laure
de
rastignac
the
bishop
and
two
or
three
of
the
young
men
they
one
and
all
looked
bored
as
a
matter
of
fact
those
who
understand
poetry
strive
to
develop
the
germs
of
another
poetry
quickened
within
them
by
the
poet
poetry
but
this
glacial
audience
so
far
from
attaining
to
the
spirit
of
the
poet
did
not
even
listen
to
the
letter
lucien
felt
profoundly
discouraged
he
was
damp
with
chilly
perspiration
a
glowing
glance
from
louise
to
whom
he
turned
gave
him
courage
to
persevere
to
the
end
but
this
poet
heart
was
bleeding
from
countless
wounds
do
you
find
this
very
amusing
fifine
inquired
the
wizened
lili
who
perhaps
had
expected
some
kind
of
gymnastics
do
ask
me
what
i
think
dear
i
can
not
keep
my
eyes
open
when
any
one
begins
to
read
aloud
i
hope
that
nais
will
not
give
us
poetry
often
in
the
evenings
said
francis
if
i
am
obliged
to
attend
while
somebody
reads
aloud
after
dinner
it
upsets
my
digestion
poor
dearie
whispered
zephirine
take
a
glass
of
eau
it
was
very
well
declaimed
said
alexandre
but
i
like
whist
better
myself
after
this
dictum
which
passed
muster
as
a
joke
from
the
play
on
the
word
whist
several
were
of
the
opinion
that
the
reader
voice
needed
a
rest
and
on
this
pretext
one
or
two
couples
slipped
away
into
the
but
louise
and
the
bishop
and
pretty
laure
de
rastignac
besought
lucien
to
continue
and
this
time
he
caught
the
attention
of
his
audience
with
chenier
spirited
reactionary
several
persons
carried
away
by
his
impassioned
delivery
applauded
the
reading
without
understanding
the
sense
people
of
this
sort
are
impressed
by
vociferation
as
a
coarse
palate
is
ticked
by
strong
spirits
during
the
interval
as
they
partook
of
ices
zephirine
despatched
francis
to
examine
the
volume
and
informed
her
neighbor
amelie
that
the
poetry
was
in
print
amelie
brightened
visibly
why
that
is
easily
explained
said
she
de

works
for
a
printer
it
is
as
if
a
pretty
woman
should
make
her
own
dresses
she
added
looking
at
lolotte
he
printed
his
poetry
himself
said
the
women
among
themselves
then
why
does
he
call
himself
de
rubempre
inquired
jacques
if
a
noble
takes
a
handicraft
he
ought
to
lay
his
name
aside
so
he
did
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
zizine
but
his
name
was
plebeian
and
he
took
his
mother
name
which
is
noble
well
if
his
verses
are
printed
we
can
read
them
for
ourselves
said
astolphe
this
piece
of
stupidity
complicated
the
question
until

du
chatelet
condescended
to
inform
these
unlettered
folk
that
the
prefatory
announcement
was
no
oratorical
flourish
but
a
statement
of
fact
and
added
that
the
poems
had
been
written
by
a
royalist
brother
of
chenier
the
revolutionary
leader
all
angouleme
except
mme
de
rastignac
and
her
two
daughters
and
the
bishop
who
had
really
felt
the
grandeur
of
the
poetry
were
mystified
and
took
offence
at
the
hoax
there
was
a
smothered
murmur
but
lucien
did
not
heed
it
the
intoxication
of
the
poetry
was
upon
him
he
was
far
away
from
the
hateful
world
striving
to
render
in
speech
the
music
that
filled
his
soul
seeing
the
faces
about
him
through
a
cloudy
haze
he
read
the
sombre
elegy
on
the
suicide
lines
in
the
taste
of
a
day
pervaded
by
sublime
melancholy
then
he
turned
to
the
page
where
the
line
occurs
thy
songs
are
sweet
i
love
to
say
them
over
and
ended
with
the
delicate
idyll
mme
de
bargeton
sat
with
one
hand
buried
in
her
curls
heedless
of
the
havoc
she
wrought
among
them
gazing
before
her
with
unseeing
eyes
alone
in
her
lost
in
delicious
dreaming
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
had
been
transported
to
the
sphere
which
was
hers
by
right
of
nature
judge
therefore
how
unpleasantly
she
was
disturbed
by
amelie
who
took
it
upon
herself
to
express
the
general
wish
nais
this
voice
broke
in
we
came
to
hear
chardon
poetry
and
you
are
giving
us
poetry
out
of
a
book
the
extracts
are
very
nice
but
the
ladies
feel
a
patriotic
preference
for
the
wine
of
the
country
they
would
rather
have
it
the
french
language
does
not
lend
itself
very
readily
to
poetry
does
it
astolphe
remarked
to
chatelet
cicero
prose
is
a
thousand
times
more
poetical
to
my
way
of
thinking
the
true
poetry
of
france
is
song
lyric
verse
chatelet
answered
which
proves
that
our
language
is
eminently
adapted
for
music
said
adrien
i
should
like
very
much
to
hear
the
poetry
that
has
cost
nais
her
reputation
said
zephirine
but
after
receiving
amelie
request
in
such
a
way
it
is
not
very
likely
that
she
will
give
us
a
specimen
she
ought
to
have
them
recited
in
justice
to
herself
said
francis
the
little
fellow
genius
is
his
sole
justification
you
have
been
in
the
diplomatic
service
said
amelie
to
du
chatelet
go
and
manage
it
somehow
nothing
easier
said
the
baron
the
princess
private
secretary
being
accustomed
to
petty
manoeuvres
of
this
kind
went
to
the
bishop
and
contrived
to
bring
him
to
the
fore
at
the
bishop
entreaty
nais
had
no
choice
but
to
ask
lucien
to
recite
his
own
verses
for
them
and
the
baron
received
a
languishing
smile
from
amelie
as
the
reward
of
his
prompt
success
decidedly
the
baron
is
a
very
clever
man
she
observed
to
lolotte
but
amelie
previous
acidulous
remark
about
women
who
made
their
own
dresses
rankled
in
lolotte
mind
since
when
have
you
begun
to
recognize
the
emperor
barons
she
asked
smiling
lucien
had
essayed
to
deify
his
beloved
in
an
ode
dedicated
to
her
under
a
title
in
favor
with
all
lads
who
write
verse
after
leaving
school
this
ode
so
fondly
cherished
so
beautiful
since
it
was
the
outpouring
of
all
the
love
in
his
heart
seemed
to
him
to
be
the
one
piece
of
his
own
work
that
could
hold
its
own
with
chenier
verse
and
with
a
tolerably
fatuous
glance
at
mme
de
bargeton
he
announced
to
her
he
struck
an
attitude
proudly
for
the
delivery
of
the
ambitious
piece
for
his
author
felt
safe
and
at
ease
behind
mme
de
bargeton
petticoat
and
at
the
selfsame
moment
mme
de
bargeton
betrayed
her
own
secret
to
the
women
curious
eyes
although
she
had
always
looked
down
upon
this
audience
from
her
own
loftier
intellectual
heights
she
could
not
help
trembling
for
lucien
her
face
was
troubled
there
was
a
sort
of
mute
appeal
for
indulgence
in
her
glances
and
while
the
verses
were
recited
she
was
obliged
to
lower
her
eyes
and
dissemble
her
pleasure
as
stanza
followed
stanza
to
her
out
of
the
glowing
heart
of
the
torrent
of
glory
and
light
at
the
foot
of
jehovah
throne
where
the
angels
stand
afar
each
on
a
seistron
of
gold
repeating
the
prayers
of
the
night
put
up
for
each
by
his
star
out
from
the
cherubim
choir
a
angel
springs
veiling
the
glory
of
god
that
dwells
on
a
dazzling
brow
leaving
the
courts
of
heaven
to
sink
upon
silver
wings
down
to
our
world
below
god
looked
in
pity
on
earth
and
the
angel
reading
his
thought
came
down
to
lull
the
pain
of
the
mighty
spirit
at
strife
reverent
bent
the
maid
and
for
age
left
desolate
brought
flowers
of
the
springtime
of
life
bringing
a
dream
of
hope
to
solace
the
mother
fears
hearkening
unto
the
voice
of
the
tardy
repentant
cry
glad
as
angels
are
glad
to
reckon
earth
pitying
tears
given
with
alms
of
a
sigh
one
there
is
and
but
one
bright
messenger
sent
from
the
skies
whom
earth
like
a
lover
fain
would
hold
from
the
flight
but
the
angel
weeping
turns
and
gazes
with
sad
sweet
eyes
up
to
the
heaven
of
light
not
by
the
radiant
eyes
not
by
the
kindling
glow
of
virtue
sent
from
god
did
i
know
the
secret
sign
nor
read
the
token
sent
on
a
white
and
dazzling
brow
of
an
origin
divine
nay
it
was
love
grown
blind
and
dazed
with
excess
of
light
striving
and
striving
in
vain
to
mingle
earth
and
heaven
helpless
and
powerless
against
the
invincible
armor
bright
by
the
dread
archangel
given
ah
be
wary
take
heed
lest
aught
should
be
seen
or
heard
of
the
shining
seraph
band
as
they
take
the
heavenward
way
too
soon
the
angel
on
earth
will
learn
the
magical
word
sung
at
the
close
of
the
day
then
you
shall
see
afar
rifting
the
darkness
of
night
a
gleam
as
of
dawn
that
spread
across
the
starry
floor
and
the
seaman
that
watch
for
a
sign
shall
mark
the
track
of
their
flight
a
luminous
pathway
in
heaven
and
a
beacon
for
evermore
do
you
read
the
riddle
said
amelie
giving
du
chatelet
a
coquettish
glance
it
is
the
sort
of
stuff
that
we
all
of
us
wrote
more
or
less
after
we
left
school
said
the
baron
with
a
bored
expression
he
was
acting
his
part
of
arbiter
of
taste
who
has
seen
everything
we
used
to
deal
in
ossianic
mists
malvinas
and
fingals
and
cloudy
shapes
and
warriors
who
got
out
of
their
tombs
with
stars
above
their
heads
nowadays
this
poetical
frippery
has
been
replaced
by
jehovah
angels
seistrons
the
plumes
of
seraphim
and
all
the
paraphernalia
of
paradise
freshened
up
with
a
few
new
words
such
as
infinite
solitude
intelligence
you
have
lakes
and
the
words
of
the
almighty
a
kind
of
christianized
pantheism
enriched
with
the
most
extraordinary
and
rhymes
we
are
in
quite
another
latitude
in
fact
we
have
left
the
north
for
the
east
but
the
darkness
is
just
as
thick
as
before
if
the
ode
is
obscure
the
declaration
is
very
clear
it
seems
to
me
said
zephirine
and
the
archangel
armor
is
a
tolerably
thin
gauze
robe
said
francis
politeness
demanded
that
the
audience
should
profess
to
be
enchanted
with
the
poem
and
the
women
furious
because
they
had
no
poets
in
their
train
to
extol
them
as
angels
rose
looked
bored
by
the
reading
murmuring
very
nice
charming
perfect
with
frigid
coldness
if
you
love
me
do
not
congratulate
the
poet
or
his
angel
lolotte
laid
her
commands
on
her
dear
adrien
in
imperious
tones
and
adrien
was
fain
to
obey
empty
words
after
all
zephirine
remarked
to
francis
and
love
is
a
poem
that
we
live
you
have
just
expressed
the
very
thing
that
i
was
thinking
zizine
but
i
should
not
have
put
it
so
neatly
said
stanislas
scanning
himself
from
top
to
toe
with
loving
attention
i
would
give
i
do
know
how
much
to
see
nais
pride
brought
down
a
bit
said
amelie
addressing
chatelet
nais
sets
up
to
be
an
archangel
as
if
she
were
better
than
the
rest
of
us
and
mixes
us
up
with
low
people
his
father
was
an
apothecary
and
his
mother
is
a
nurse
his
sister
works
in
a
laundry
and
he
himself
is
a
foreman
if
his
father
sold
biscuits
for
worms
said
jacques
he
ought
to
have
made
his
son
take
them
he
is
continuing
in
his
father
line
of
business
for
the
stuff
that
he
has
just
been
reading
to
us
is
a
drug
in
the
market
it
seems
said
stanislas
striking
one
of
his
most
killing
attitudes
drug
for
drug
i
would
rather
have
something
else
every
one
apparently
combined
to
humiliate
lucien
by
various
aristocrats
sarcasms
lili
the
religious
thought
it
a
charitable
deed
to
use
any
means
of
enlightening
nais
and
nais
was
on
the
brink
of
a
piece
of
folly
francis
the
diplomatist
undertook
the
direction
of
the
silly
conspiracy
every
one
was
interested
in
the
progress
of
the
drama
it
would
be
something
to
talk
about
the
being
far
from
anxious
to
engage
in
a
duel
with
a
young
poet
who
would
fly
into
a
rage
at
the
first
hint
of
insult
under
his
lady
eyes
was
wise
enough
to
see
that
the
only
way
of
dealing
lucien
his
deathblow
was
by
the
spiritual
arm
which
was
safe
from
vengeance
he
therefore
followed
the
example
set
by
chatelet
the
astute
and
went
to
the
bishop
him
he
proceeded
to
mystify
he
told
the
bishop
that
lucien
mother
was
a
woman
of
uncommon
powers
and
great
modesty
and
that
it
was
she
who
found
the
subjects
for
her
son
verses
nothing
pleased
lucien
so
much
according
to
the
guileful
francis
as
any
recognition
of
her
talents
he
worshiped
his
mother
then
having
inculcated
these
notions
he
left
the
rest
to
time
his
lordship
was
sure
to
bring
out
the
insulting
allusion
for
which
he
had
been
so
carefully
prepared
in
the
course
of
conversation
when
francis
and
the
bishop
joined
the
little
group
where
lucien
stood
the
circle
who
gave
him
the
cup
of
hemlock
to
drain
by
little
sips
watched
him
with
redoubled
interest
the
poet
luckless
young
man
being
a
total
stranger
and
unaware
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
house
could
only
look
at
mme
de
bargeton
and
give
embarrassed
answers
to
embarrassing
questions
he
knew
neither
the
names
nor
condition
of
the
people
about
him
the
women
silly
speeches
made
him
blush
for
them
and
he
was
at
his
wits
end
for
a
reply
he
felt
moreover
how
very
far
removed
he
was
from
these
divinities
of
angouleme
when
he
heard
himself
addressed
sometimes
as
chardon
sometimes
as
de
rubempre
while
they
addressed
each
other
as
lolotte
adrien
astolphe
lili
and
fifine
his
confusion
rose
to
a
height
when
taking
lili
for
a
man
surname
he
addressed
the
coarse
de
senonches
as
lili
that
nimrod
broke
in
upon
him
with
a
lulu
and
mme
de
bargeton
flushed
red
to
the
eyes
a
woman
must
be
blind
indeed
to
bring
this
little
fellow
among
us
muttered
senonches
zephirine
turned
to
speak
to
the
marquise
de
pimentel
do
you
not
see
a
strong
likeness
between
chardon
and
de
madame
she
asked
in
a
low
but
quite
audible
voice
the
likeness
is
ideal
smiled
mme
de
pimentel
glory
has
a
power
of
attraction
to
which
we
can
confess
said
mme
de
bargeton
addressing
the
marquise
some
women
are
as
much
attracted
by
greatness
as
others
by
littleness
she
added
looking
at
francis
the
was
beyond
zephirine
comprehension
she
thought
her
consul
a
very
great
man
but
the
marquise
laughed
and
her
laughter
ranged
her
on
nais
side
you
are
very
fortunate
monsieur
said
the
marquis
de
pimentel
addressing
lucien
for
the
purpose
of
calling
him
de
rubempre
and
not
chardon
as
before
you
should
never
find
time
heavy
on
your
hands
do
you
work
quickly
asked
lolotte
much
in
the
way
that
she
would
have
asked
a
joiner
if
it
took
long
to
make
a
box
the
bludgeon
stroke
stunned
lucien
but
he
raised
his
head
at
mme
de
bargeton
reply
my
dear
poetry
does
not
grow
in
de
rubempre
head
like
grass
in
our
courtyards
madame
we
can
not
feel
too
reverently
towards
the
noble
spirits
in
whom
god
has
set
some
ray
of
this
light
said
the
bishop
addressing
lolotte
yes
poetry
is
something
holy
poetry
implies
suffering
how
many
silent
nights
those
verses
that
you
admire
have
cost
we
should
bow
in
love
and
reverence
before
the
poet
his
life
here
is
almost
always
a
life
of
sorrow
but
god
doubtless
reserves
a
place
in
heaven
for
him
among
his
prophets
this
young
man
is
a
poet
he
added
laying
a
hand
on
lucien
head
do
you
not
see
the
sign
of
fate
set
on
that
high
forehead
of
his
glad
to
be
so
generously
championed
lucien
made
his
acknowledgments
in
a
grateful
look
not
knowing
that
the
worthy
prelate
was
to
deal
his
deathblow
mme
de
bargeton
eyes
traveled
round
the
hostile
circle
her
glances
went
like
arrows
to
the
depths
of
her
rivals
hearts
and
left
them
twice
as
furious
as
before
ah
monseigneur
cried
lucien
hoping
to
break
thick
heads
with
his
golden
sceptre
but
ordinary
people
have
neither
your
intellect
nor
your
charity
no
one
heeds
our
sorrows
our
toil
is
unrecognized
the
working
in
the
mine
does
not
labor
as
we
to
wrest
metaphors
from
the
heart
of
the
most
ungrateful
of
all
languages
if
this
is
poetry
to
give
ideas
such
definite
and
clear
expressions
that
all
the
world
can
see
and
understand
the
poet
must
continually
range
through
the
entire
scale
of
human
intellects
so
that
he
can
satisfy
the
demands
of
all
he
must
conceal
hard
thinking
and
emotion
two
antagonistic
powers
beneath
the
most
vivid
color
he
must
know
how
to
make
one
word
cover
a
whole
world
of
thought
he
must
give
the
results
of
whole
systems
of
philosophy
in
a
few
picturesque
lines
indeed
his
songs
are
like
seeds
that
must
break
into
blossom
in
other
hearts
wherever
they
find
the
soil
prepared
by
personal
experience
how
can
you
express
unless
you
first
have
felt
and
is
not
passion
suffering
poetry
is
only
brought
forth
after
painful
wanderings
in
the
vast
regions
of
thought
and
life
there
are
men
and
women
in
books
who
seem
more
really
alive
to
us
than
men

added
with
bitterness
in
his
tone
as
he
took
a
vengeful
glance
round

circle

revenge

gleam

delight
in

eyes
the
smile
of
satisfied
caste
that
traveled
from

was
aggravated
by

burst
into
a

moments

monseigneur

a
little
above
our
heads
these
ladies
do
not
understand
your
meaning
said
mme
de
bargeton
and
the
words
paralyzed
the
laughter
and
drew
astonished
eyes
upon
her
a
poet
who
looks
to
the
bible
for
his
inspiration
has
a
mother
indeed
in
the
m
de
rubempre
will
you
recite
john
in
for
us
or
so
that
his
lordship
may
see
that
rome
is
still
the
of
virgil
the
women
exchanged
smiles
at
the
latin
words
the
bravest
and
highest
spirits
know
times
of
prostration
at
the
outset
of
life
lucien
had
sunk
to
the
depths
at
the
blow
but
he
struck
the
bottom
with
his
feet
and
rose
to
the
surface
again
vowing
to
subjugate
this
little
world
he
rose
like
a
bull
stung
to
fury
by
a
shower
of
darts
and
prepared
to
obey
louise
by
declaiming
john
in
but
by
this
time
the
had
claimed
their
complement
of
players
who
returned
to
the
accustomed
groove
to
find
amusement
there
which
poetry
had
not
afforded
them
they
felt
besides
that
the
revenge
of
so
many
outraged
vanities
would
be
incomplete
unless
it
were
followed
up
by
contemptuous
indifference
so
they
showed
their
tacit
disdain
for
the
native
product
by
leaving
lucien
and
mme
de
bargeton
to
themselves
every
one
appeared
to
be
absorbed
in
his
own
affairs
one
chattered
with
the
prefect
about
a
new
crossroad
another
proposed
to
vary
the
pleasures
of
the
evening
with
a
little
music
the
great
world
of
angouleme
feeling
that
it
was
no
judge
of
poetry
was
very
anxious
in
the
first
place
to
hear
the
verdict
of
the
pimentels
and
the
rastignacs
and
formed
a
little
group
about
them
the
great
influence
wielded
in
the
department
by
these
two
families
was
always
felt
on
every
important
occasion
every
one
was
jealous
of
them
every
one
paid
court
to
them
foreseeing
that
they
might
some
day
need
that
influence
what
do
you
think
of
our
poet
and
his
poetry
jacques
asked
of
the
marquise
jacques
used
to
shoot
over
the
lands
belonging
to
the
pimentel
family
why
it
is
not
bad
for
provincial
poetry
she
said
smiling
and
besides
such
a
beautiful
poet
can
not
do
anything
amiss
every
one
thought
the
decision
admirable
it
traveled
from
lip
to
lip
gaining
malignance
by
the
way
then
chatelet
was
called
upon
to
accompany
du
bartas
on
the
piano
while
he
mangled
the
great
solo
from
and
the
way
being
opened
to
music
the
audience
as
in
duty
bound
listened
while
chatelet
in
turn
sang
one
of
ballads
a
chivalrous
ditty
made
in
the
time
of
the
empire
duets
followed
of
the
kind
usually
left
to
misses
and
rescued
from
the
schoolroom
by
mme
du
brossard
who
meant
to
make
a
brilliant
display
of
her
dear
camille
talents
for
de
benefit
mme
du
bargeton
hurt
by
the
contempt
which
every
one
showed
her
poet
paid
back
scorn
for
scorn
by
going
to
her
boudoir
during
these
performances
she
was
followed
by
the
prelate
his
had
just
been
explaining
the
profound
irony
of
the
epigram
into
which
he
had
been
entrapped
and
the
bishop
wished
to
make
amends
mlle
de
rastignac
fascinated
by
the
poetry
also
slipped
into
the
boudoir
without
her
mother
knowledge
louise
drew
lucien
to
her
sofa
and
with
no
one
to
see
or
hear
she
murmured
in
his
ear
dear
angel
they
did
not
understand
you
but
songs
are
sweet
i
love
to
say
them
over
and
lucien
took
comfort
from
the
pretty
speech
and
forgot
his
woes
for
a
little
glory
is
not
to
be
had
cheaply
mme
de
bargeton
continued
taking
his
hand
and
holding
it
tightly
in
her
own
endure
your
woes
my
friend
you
will
be
great
one
day
your
pain
is
the
price
of
your
immortality
if
only
i
had
a
hard
struggle
before
me
god
preserve
you
from
the
enervating
life
without
battles
in
which
the
eagle
wings
have
no
room
to
spread
themselves
i
envy
you
for
if
you
suffer
at
least
you
live
you
will
put
out
your
strength
you
will
feel
the
hope
of
victory
your
strife
will
be
glorious
and
when
you
shall
come
to
your
kingdom
and
reach
the
imperial
sphere
where
great
minds
are
enthroned
then
remember
the
poor
creatures
disinherited
by
fate
whose
intellects
pine
in
an
oppressive
moral
atmosphere
who
die
and
have
never
lived
knowing
all
the
while
what
life
might
be
think
of
the
piercing
eyes
that
have
seen
nothing
the
delicate
senses
that
have
only
known
the
scent
of
poison
flowers
then
tell
in
your
song
of
plants
that
wither
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
choked
by
twining
growths
and
rank
greedy
vegetation
plants
that
have
never
been
kissed
by
the
sunlight
and
die
never
having
put
forth
a
blossom
it
would
be
a
terribly
gloomy
poem
would
it
not
a
fanciful
subject
what
a
sublime
poem
might
be
made
of
the
story
of
some
daughter
of
the
desert
transported
to
some
cold
western
clime
calling
for
her
beloved
sun
dying
of
a
grief
that
none
can
understand
overcome
with
cold
and
longing
it
would
be
an
allegory
many
lives
are
like
that
you
would
picture
the
spirit
which
remembers
heaven
said
the
bishop
some
one
surely
must
have
written
such
a
poem
in
the
days
of
old
i
like
to
think
that
i
see
a
fragment
of
it
in
the
song
of
songs
take
that
as
your
subject
said
laure
de
rastignac
expressing
her
artless
belief
in
lucien
powers
the
great
sacred
poem
of
france
is
still
unwritten
remarked
the
bishop
believe
me
glory
and
success
await
the
man
of
talent
who
shall
work
for
religion
that
task
will
be
his
said
mme
de
bargeton
rhetorically
do
you
not
see
the
first
beginnings
of
the
vision
of
the
poem
like
the
flame
of
dawn
in
his
eyes
nais
is
treating
us
very
badly
said
fifine
what
can
she
be
doing
do
you
hear
said
stanislas
she
is
flourishing
away
using
big
words
that
you
can
not
make
head
or
tail
of
amelie
fifine
adrien
and
francis
appeared
in
the
doorway
with
mme
de
rastignac
who
came
to
look
for
her
daughter
nais
cried
the
two
ladies
both
delighted
to
break
in
upon
the
quiet
chat
in
the
boudoir
it
would
be
very
nice
of
you
to
come
and
play
something
for
us
my
dear
child
de
rubempre
is
just
about
to
recite
his
john
in
a
magnificent
biblical
poem
biblical
echoed
fifine
in
amazement
amelie
and
fifine
went
back
to
the
taking
the
word
back
with
them
as
food
for
laughter
lucien
pleaded
a
defective
memory
and
excused
himself
when
he
reappeared
nobody
took
the
slightest
notice
of
him
every
one
was
chatting
or
busy
at
the
the
aureole
had
been
plucked
away
the
landowners
had
no
use
for
him
the
more
pretentious
sort
looked
upon
him
as
an
enemy
to
their
ignorance
while
the
women
were
jealous
of
mme
de
bargeton
the
beatrice
of
this
modern
dante
to
use
the
phrase
and
looked
at
him
with
cold
scornful
eyes
so
this
is
society
lucien
said
to
himself
as
he
went
down
to
by
the
steps
of
beaulieu
for
there
are
times
when
we
choose
to
take
the
longest
way
that
the
physical
exercise
of
walking
may
promote
the
flow
of
ideas
so
far
from
being
disheartened
the
fury
of
repulsed
ambition
gave
lucien
new
strength
like
all
those
whose
instincts
bring
them
to
a
higher
social
sphere
which
they
reach
before
they
can
hold
their
own
in
it
lucien
vowed
to
make
any
sacrifice
to
the
end
that
he
might
remain
on
that
higher
social
level
one
by
one
he
drew
out
the
poisoned
shafts
on
his
way
home
talking
aloud
to
himself
scoffing
at
the
fools
with
whom
he
had
to
do
inventing
neat
answers
to
their
idiotic
questions
desperately
vexed
that
the
witty
responses
occurred
to
him
so
late
in
the
day
by
the
time
that
he
reached
the
bordeaux
road
between
the
river
and
the
foot
of
the
hill
he
thought
that
he
could
see
eve
and
david
sitting
on
a
baulk
of
timber
by
the
river
in
the
moonlight
and
went
down
the
footpath
towards
them
while
lucien
was
hastening
to
the
torture
in
mme
de
bargeton
rooms
his
sister
had
changed
her
dress
for
a
gown
of
pink
cambric
covered
with
narrow
stripes
a
straw
hat
and
a
little
silk
shawl
the
simple
costume
seemed
like
a
rich
toilette
on
eve
for
she
was
one
of
those
women
whose
great
nature
lends
stateliness
to
the
least
personal
detail
and
david
felt
prodigiously
shy
of
her
now
that
she
had
changed
her
working
dress
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
speak
of
himself
but
now
as
he
gave
his
arm
to
this
beautiful
girl
and
they
walked
through
together
he
could
find
nothing
to
say
to
her
love
delights
in
such
reverent
awe
as
redeemed
souls
know
on
beholding
the
glory
of
god
so
in
silence
the
two
lovers
went
across
the
bridge
of
saint
anne
and
followed
the
left
bank
of
the
charente
eve
felt
embarrassed
by
the
pause
and
stopped
to
look
along
the
river
a
joyous
shaft
of
sunset
had
turned
the
water
between
the
bridge
and
the
new
powder
mills
into
a
sheet
of
gold
what
a
beautiful
evening
it
is
she
said
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
the
air
is
warm
and
fresh
and
full
of
the
scent
of
flowers
and
there
is
a
wonderful
sky
everything
speaks
to
our
heart
said
david
trying
to
proceed
to
love
by
way
of
analogy
those
who
love
find
infinite
delight
in
discovering
the
poetry
of
their
own
inmost
souls
in
every
chance
effect
of
the
landscape
in
the
thin
clear
air
in
the
scent
of
the
earth
nature
speaks
for
them
and
loosens
their
tongues
too
eve
said
merrily
you
were
very
silent
as
we
came
through
do
you
know
i
felt
quite
uncomfortable
you
looked
so
beautiful
that
i
could
not
say
anything
david
answered
candidly
then
just
now
i
am
not
so
beautiful
inquired
she
it
is
not
that
he
said
but
i
was
so
happy
to
have
this
walk
alone
with
you
that
he
stopped
short
in
confusion
and
looked
at
the
hillside
and
the
road
to
saintes
if
the
walk
is
any
pleasure
to
you
i
am
delighted
for
i
owe
you
an
evening
i
think
when
you
have
given
up
yours
for
me
when
you
refused
to
go
to
mme
de
bargeton
you
were
quite
as
generous
as
lucien
when
he
made
the
demand
at
the
risk
of
vexing
her
no
not
generous
only
wise
said
david
and
now
that
we
are
quite
alone
under
the
sky
with
no
listeners
except
the
bushes
and
the
reeds
by
the
edge
of
the
charente
let
me
tell
you
about
my
anxiety
as
to
lucien
present
step
dear
eve
after
all
that
i
have
just
said
i
hope
that
you
will
look
on
my
fears
as
a
refinement
of
friendship
you
and
your
mother
have
done
all
that
you
could
to
put
him
above
his
social
position
but
when
you
stimulated
his
ambition
did
you
not
unthinkingly
condemn
him
to
a
hard
struggle
how
can
he
maintain
himself
in
the
society
to
which
his
tastes
incline
him
i
know
lucien
he
likes
to
reap
he
does
not
like
toil
it
is
his
nature
social
claims
will
take
up
the
whole
of
his
time
and
for
a
man
who
has
nothing
but
his
brains
time
is
capital
he
likes
to
shine
society
will
stimulate
his
desires
until
no
money
will
satisfy
them
instead
of
earning
money
he
will
spend
it
you
have
accustomed
him
to
believe
in
his
great
powers
in
fact
but
the
world
at
large
declines
to
believe
in
any
man
superior
intellect
until
he
has
achieved
some
signal
success
now
success
in
literature
is
only
won
in
solitude
and
by
dogged
work
what
will
mme
de
bargeton
give
your
brother
in
return
for
so
many
days
spent
at
her
feet
lucien
has
too
much
spirit
to
accept
help
from
her
and
he
can
not
afford
as
we
know
to
cultivate
her
society
twice
ruinous
as
it
is
for
him
sooner
or
later
that
woman
will
throw
over
this
dear
brother
of
ours
but
not
before
she
has
spoiled
him
for
hard
work
and
given
him
a
taste
for
luxury
and
a
contempt
for
our
humdrum
life
she
will
develop
his
love
of
enjoyment
his
inclination
for
idleness
that
debauches
a
poetic
soul
yes
it
makes
me
tremble
to
think
that
this
great
lady
may
make
a
plaything
of
lucien
if
she
cares
for
him
sincerely
he
will
forget
everything
else
for
her
or
if
she
does
not
love
him
she
will
make
him
unhappy
for
he
is
wild
about
her
you
have
sent
a
chill
of
dread
through
my
heart
said
eve
stopping
as
they
reached
the
weir
but
so
long
as
mother
is
strong
enough
for
her
tiring
life
so
long
as
i
live
we
shall
earn
enough
perhaps
between
us
to
keep
lucien
until
success
comes
my
courage
will
never
fail
said
eve
brightening
there
is
no
hardship
in
work
when
we
work
for
one
we
love
it
is
not
drudgery
it
makes
me
happy
to
think
that
i
toil
so
much
if
indeed
it
is
toil
for
him
oh
do
not
be
in
the
least
afraid
we
will
earn
money
enough
to
send
lucien
into
the
great
world
there
lies
his
road
to
success
and
there
lies
his
road
to
ruin
returned
david
dear
eve
listen
to
me
a
man
needs
an
independent
fortune
or
the
sublime
cynicism
of
poverty
for
the
slow
execution
of
great
work
believe
me
horror
of
privation
is
so
great
the
savor
of
banquets
the
incense
of
success
is
so
sweet
in
his
nostrils
his
has
grown
so
much
in
mme
de
bargeton
boudoir
that
he
will
do
anything
desperate
sooner
than
fall
back
and
you
will
never
earn
enough
for
his
requirements
then
you
are
only
a
false
friend
to
him
eve
cried
in
despair
or
you
would
not
discourage
us
in
this
way
eve
eve
cried
david
if
only
i
could
be
a
brother
to
lucien
you
alone
can
give
me
that
title
he
could
accept
anything
from
me
then
i
should
claim
the
right
of
devoting
my
life
to
him
with
the
love
that
hallows
your
but
with
some
worldly
wisdom
too
eve
my
darling
give
lucien
a
store
from
which
he
need
not
blush
to
draw
his
brother
purse
will
be
like
his
own
will
it
not
if
you
only
knew
all
my
thoughts
about
lucien
position
if
he
means
to
go
to
mme
de
bargeton
he
must
not
be
my
foreman
any
longer
poor
fellow
he
ought
not
to
live
in
you
ought
not
to
be
a
working
girl
and
your
mother
must
give
up
her
employment
as
well
if
you
would
consent
to
be
my
wife
the
difficulties
will
all
be
smoothed
away
lucien
might
live
on
the
second
floor
in
the
place
du
murier
until
i
can
build
rooms
for
him
over
the
shed
at
the
back
of
the
yard
if
my
father
will
allow
it
that
and
in
that
way
we
would
arrange
a
free
and
independent
life
for
him
the
wish
to
support
lucien
will
give
me
a
better
will
to
work
than
i
ever
should
have
had
for
myself
alone
but
it
rests
with
you
to
give
me
the
right
to
devote
myself
to
him
some
day
perhaps
he
will
go
to
paris
the
only
place
that
can
bring
out
all
that
is
in
him
and
where
his
talents
will
be
appreciated
and
rewarded
living
in
paris
is
expensive
and
the
earnings
of
all
three
of
us
will
be
needed
for
his
support
and
besides
will
not
you
and
your
mother
need
some
one
to
lean
upon
then
dear
eve
marry
me
for
love
of
lucien
perhaps
afterwards
you
will
love
me
when
you
see
how
i
shall
strive
to
help
him
and
to
make
you
happy
we
are
both
of
us
equally
simple
in
our
tastes
we
have
few
wants
lucien
welfare
shall
be
the
great
object
of
our
lives
his
heart
shall
be
our
we
will
lay
up
all
our
fortune
and
think
and
feel
and
hope
in
him
worldly
considerations
keep
us
apart
said
eve
moved
by
this
love
that
tried
to
explain
away
its
greatness
you
are
rich
and
i
am
poor
one
must
love
indeed
to
overcome
such
a
difficulty
then
you
do
not
care
enough
for
me
cried
the
stricken
david
but
perhaps
your
father
would
object
never
mind
said
david
if
asking
my
father
is
all
that
is
necessary
you
will
be
my
wife
eve
my
dear
eve
how
you
have
lightened
life
for
me
in
a
moment
and
my
heart
has
been
very
heavy
with
thoughts
that
i
could
not
utter
i
did
not
know
how
to
speak
of
them
only
tell
me
that
you
care
for
me
a
little
and
i
will
take
courage
to
tell
you
the
rest
indeed
she
said
you
make
me
quite
ashamed
but
confidence
for
confidence
i
will
tell
you
this
that
i
have
never
thought
of
any
one
but
you
in
my
life
i
looked
upon
you
as
one
of
those
men
to
whom
a
woman
might
be
proud
to
belong
and
i
did
not
dare
to
hope
so
great
a
thing
for
myself
a
penniless
working
girl
with
no
prospects
that
is
enough
that
is
enough
he
answered
sitting
down
on
the
bar
by
the
weir
for
they
had
gone
to
and
fro
like
mad
creatures
over
the
same
length
of
pathway
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
her
voice
expressing
for
the
first
time
a
woman
sweet
anxiety
for
one
who
belongs
to
her
nothing
but
good
he
answered
it
is
the
sight
of
a
whole
lifetime
of
happiness
that
dazzles
me
as
it
were
it
is
overwhelming
why
am
i
happier
than
you
he
asked
with
a
touch
of
sadness
for
i
know
that
i
am
happier
eve
looked
at
david
with
mischievous
doubtful
eyes
that
asked
an
explanation
dear
eve
i
am
taking
more
than
i
give
so
i
shall
always
love
you
more
than
you
love
me
because
i
have
more
reason
to
love
you
are
an
angel
i
am
a
man
i
am
not
so
learned
eve
said
smiling
i
love
you
as
much
as
you
love
lucien
he
broke
in
enough
to
be
your
wife
enough
to
devote
myself
to
you
to
try
not
to
add
anything
to
your
burdens
for
we
shall
have
some
struggles
it
will
not
be
quite
easy
at
first
dear
eve
have
you
known
that
i
loved
you
since
the
first
day
i
saw
you
where
is
the
woman
who
does
not
feel
that
she
is
loved
now
let
me
get
rid
of
your
scruples
as
to
my
imaginary
riches
i
am
a
poor
man
dear
yes
it
pleased
my
father
to
ruin
me
he
made
a
speculation
of
me
as
a
good
many
benefactors
do
if
i
make
a
fortune
it
will
be
entirely
through
you
that
is
not
a
speech
but
sober
serious
earnest
i
ought
to
tell
you
about
my
faults
for
they
are
exceedingly
bad
ones
in
a
man
who
has
his
way
to
make
my
character
and
habits
and
favorite
occupations
all
unfit
me
for
business
and
and
yet
we
can
only
make
money
by
some
kind
of
industry
if
i
have
some
faculty
for
the
discovery
of
i
am
singularly
for
getting
the
gold
out
of
them
but
you
who
for
your
brother
sake
went
into
the
smallest
details
with
a
talent
for
thrift
and
the
patient
watchfulness
of
the
born
man
of
business
you
will
reap
the
harvest
that
i
shall
sow
the
present
state
of
things
for
i
have
been
like
one
of
the
family
for
a
long
time
weighs
so
heavily
upon
me
that
i
have
spent
days
and
nights
in
search
of
some
way
of
making
a
fortune
i
know
something
of
chemistry
and
a
knowledge
of
commercial
requirements
has
put
me
on
the
scent
of
a
discovery
that
is
likely
to
pay
i
can
say
nothing
as
yet
about
it
there
will
be
a
long
while
to
wait
perhaps
for
some
years
we
may
have
a
hard
time
of
it
but
i
shall
find
out
how
to
make
a
commercial
article
at
last
others
are
busy
making
the
same
researches
and
if
i
am
first
in
the
field
we
shall
have
a
large
fortune
i
have
said
nothing
to
lucien
his
enthusiastic
nature
would
spoil
everything
he
would
convert
my
hopes
into
realities
and
begin
to
live
like
a
lord
and
perhaps
get
into
debt
so
keep
my
secret
for
me
your
sweet
and
dear
companionship
will
be
consolation
in
itself
during
the
long
time
of
experiment
and
the
desire
to
gain
wealth
for
you
and
lucien
will
give
me
persistence
and
tenacity
i
had
guessed
this
too
eve
said
interrupting
him
i
knew
that
you
were
one
of
those
inventors
like
my
poor
father
who
must
have
a
woman
to
take
care
of
them
then
you
love
me
ah
say
so
without
fear
to
me
who
saw
a
symbol
of
my
love
for
you
in
your
name
eve
was
the
one
woman
in
the
world
if
it
was
true
in
the
outward
world
for
adam
it
is
true
again
in
the
inner
world
of
my
heart
for
me
my
god
do
you
love
me
yes
said
she
lengthening
out
the
word
as
if
to
make
it
cover
the
extent
of
feeling
expressed
by
a
single
syllable
well
let
us
sit
here
he
said
and
taking
eve
hand
he
went
to
a
great
baulk
of
timber
lying
below
the
wheels
of
a
let
me
breathe
the
evening
air
and
hear
the
frogs
croak
and
watch
the
moonlight
quivering
upon
the
river
let
me
take
all
this
world
about
us
into
my
soul
for
it
seems
to
me
that
my
happiness
is
written
large
over
it
all
i
am
seeing
it
for
the
first
time
in
all
its
splendor
lighted
up
by
love
grown
fair
through
you
eve
dearest
this
is
the
first
moment
of
pure
and
unmixed
joy
that
fate
has
given
to
me
i
do
not
think
that
lucien
can
be
as
happy
as
i
am
david
felt
eve
hand
damp
and
quivering
in
his
own
and
a
tear
fell
upon
it
may
i
not
know
the
secret
she
pleaded
coaxingly
you
have
a
right
to
know
it
for
your
father
was
interested
in
the
matter
and
it
is
a
pressing
question
and
for
this
reason
since
the
downfall
of
the
empire
calico
has
come
more
and
more
into
use
because
it
is
so
much
cheaper
than
linen
at
the
present
moment
paper
is
made
of
a
mixture
of
hemp
and
linen
rags
but
the
raw
material
is
dear
and
the
expense
naturally
retards
the
great
advance
which
the
french
press
is
bound
to
make
now
you
can
not
increase
the
output
of
linen
rags
a
given
population
gives
a
pretty
constant
result
and
it
only
increases
with
the
to
make
any
perceptible
difference
in
the
population
for
this
purpose
it
would
take
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
a
great
revolution
in
habits
of
life
trade
and
agriculture
and
if
the
supply
of
linen
rags
is
not
enough
to
meet
nor
of
the
demand
some
cheaper
material
than
linen
rags
must
be
found
for
cheap
paper
this
deduction
is
based
on
facts
that
came
under
my
knowledge
here
the
angouleme
the
last
to
use
pure
linen
rags
say
that
the
proportion
of
cotton
in
the
pulp
has
increased
to
a
frightful
extent
of
late
years
in
answer
to
a
question
from
eve
who
did
not
know
what
pulp
meant
david
gave
an
account
of
which
will
not
be
out
of
place
in
a
volume
which
owes
its
existence
in
book
form
to
the
paper
industry
no
less
than
to
the
but
the
long
digression
doubtless
had
best
be
condensed
at
first
paper
an
invention
not
less
marvelous
than
the
other
dependent
invention
of
printing
was
known
in
ancient
times
in
china
thence
by
the
unrecognized
channels
of
commerce
the
art
reached
asia
minor
where
paper
was
made
of
cotton
reduced
to
pulp
and
boiled
parchment
had
become
so
extremely
dear
that
a
cheap
substitute
was
discovered
in
an
imitation
of
the
cotton
paper
known
in
the
east
as
the
imitation
made
from
rags
was
first
made
at
basel
in
by
a
colony
of
greek
refugees
according
to
some
authorities
or
at
padua
in
by
an
italian
named
pax
according
to
others
in
these
ways
the
manufacture
of
paper
was
perfected
slowly
and
in
obscurity
but
this
much
is
certain
that
so
early
as
the
reign
of
charles
paper
pulp
for
was
made
in
paris
when
those
immortals
faust
coster
and
gutenberg
invented
the
book
craftsmen
as
obscure
as
many
a
great
artist
of
those
times
appropriated
paper
to
the
uses
of
typography
in
the
fifteenth
century
that
naive
and
vigorous
age
names
were
given
to
the
various
formats
as
well
as
to
the
different
sizes
of
type
names
that
bear
the
impress
of
the
naivete
of
the
times
and
the
various
sheets
came
to
be
known
by
the
different
watermarks
on
their
centres
the
grapes
the
figure
of
our
saviour
the
crown
the
shield
or
the
just
as
at
a
later
day
the
eagle
of
napoleon
time
gave
the
name
to
the
size
and
in
the
same
way
the
types
were
called
cicero
and
canon
type
because
they
were
first
used
to
print
the
treatises
of
cicero
and
theological
and
liturgical
works
italics
are
so
called
because
they
were
invented
in
italy
by
aldus
of
venice
before
the
invention
of
paper
which
can
be
woven
in
any
length
the
largest
sized
sheets
were
the
and
the
double
columbier
this
last
being
scarcely
used
now
except
for
atlases
or
engravings
and
the
size
of
paper
for
printers
use
was
determined
by
the
dimensions
of
the
when
david
explained
these
things
to
eve
was
almost
undreamed
of
in
france
although
about
denis
robert
had
invented
a
machine
for
turning
out
a
ribbon
of
paper
and
had
since
tried
to
perfect
it
the
vellum
paper
invented
by
ambroise
didot
only
dates
back
as
far
as
this
bird
eye
view
of
the
history
of
the
invention
shows
incontestably
that
great
industrial
and
intellectual
advances
are
made
exceedingly
slowly
and
little
by
little
even
as
nature
herself
proceeds
perhaps
articulate
speech
and
the
art
of
writing
were
gradually
developed
in
the
same
groping
way
as
typography
and
collect
all
the
rags
and
old
linen
of
europe
the
printer
concluded
and
buy
any
kind
of
tissue
the
rags
are
sorted
and
warehoused
by
the
wholesale
rag
merchants
who
supply
the
to
give
you
some
idea
of
the
extent
of
the
trade
you
must
know
mademoiselle
that
in
cardon
the
banker
owner
of
the
pulping
troughs
of
bruges
and
langlee
where
leorier
de
endeavored
in
to
solve
the
very
problem
that
occupied
your
father
cardon
brought
an
action
against
one
proust
for
an
error
in
weights
of
two
millions
in
a
total
of
ten
million
pounds
weight
of
rags
worth
about
four
million
francs
the
manufacturer
washes
the
rags
and
reduces
them
to
a
thin
pulp
which
is
strained
exactly
as
a
cook
strains
sauce
through
a
tamis
through
an
iron
frame
with
a
fine
wire
bottom
where
the
mark
which
give
its
name
to
the
size
of
the
paper
is
woven
the
size
of
this
as
it
is
called
regulates
the
size
of
the
sheet
when
i
was
with
the
messieurs
didot
david
continued
they
were
very
much
interested
in
this
question
and
they
are
still
interested
for
the
improvement
which
your
father
endeavored
to
make
is
a
great
commercial
requirement
and
one
of
the
crying
needs
of
the
time
and
for
this
reason
although
linen
lasts
so
much
longer
than
cotton
that
it
is
in
reality
cheaper
in
the
end
the
poor
would
rather
make
the
smaller
outlay
in
the
first
instance
and
by
virtue
of
the
law
of
victis
pay
enormously
more
before
they
have
done
the
middle
classes
do
the
same
so
there
is
a
scarcity
of
linen
in
england
where
of
the
population
use
cotton
to
the
exclusion
of
linen
they
make
nothing
but
cotton
paper
the
cotton
paper
is
very
soft
and
easily
creased
to
begin
with
and
it
has
a
further
defect
it
is
so
soluble
that
if
you
seep
a
book
made
of
cotton
paper
in
water
for
fifteen
minutes
it
turns
to
a
pulp
while
an
old
book
left
in
water
for
a
couple
of
hours
is
not
spoilt
you
could
dry
the
old
book
and
the
pages
though
yellow
and
faded
would
still
be
legible
the
work
would
not
be
destroyed
there
is
a
time
coming
when
legislation
will
equalize
our
fortunes
and
we
shall
all
be
poor
together
we
shall
want
our
linen
and
our
books
to
be
cheap
just
as
people
are
beginning
to
prefer
small
pictures
because
they
have
not
wall
space
enough
for
large
ones
well
the
shirts
and
the
books
will
not
last
that
is
all
it
is
the
same
on
all
sides
solidity
is
drying
out
so
this
problem
is
one
of
the
first
importance
for
literature
science
and
politics
one
day
in
my
office
there
was
a
hot
discussion
going
on
about
the
material
that
the
chinese
use
for
making
paper
their
paper
is
far
better
than
ours
because
the
raw
material
is
better
and
a
good
deal
was
said
about
this
thin
light
chinese
paper
for
if
it
is
light
and
thin
the
texture
is
close
there
are
no
transparent
spots
in
it
in
paris
there
are
learned
men
among
the
printers
readers
fourier
and
pierre
leroux
are
lachevardiere
readers
at
this
moment
and
the
comte
de
who
happened
to
be
correcting
proofs
for
us
came
in
in
the
middle
of
the
discussion
he
told
us
at
once
that
according
to
kempfer
and
du
halde
the
furnishes
the
substance
of
the
chinese
paper
it
is
a
vegetable
substance
like
linen
or
cotton
for
that
matter
another
reader
maintained
that
chinese
paper
was
principally
made
of
an
animal
substance
to
wit
the
silk
that
is
abundant
there
they
made
a
bet
about
it
in
my
presence
the
messieurs
didot
are
printers
to
the
institute
so
naturally
they
referred
the
question
to
that
learned
body
marcel
who
used
to
be
superintendent
of
the
royal
printing
establishment
was
umpire
and
he
sent
the
two
readers
to
grozier
librarian
at
the
arsenal
by
the
abbe
decision
they
both
lost
their
wages
the
paper
was
not
made
of
silk
nor
yet
from
the
the
pulp
proved
to
be
the
triturated
fibre
of
some
kind
of
bamboo
the
abbe
grozier
had
a
chinese
book
an
iconographical
and
technological
work
with
a
great
many
pictures
in
it
illustrating
all
the
different
processes
of
and
he
showed
us
a
picture
of
the
workshop
with
the
bamboo
stalks
lying
in
a
heap
in
the
corner
it
was
extremely
well
drawn
lucien
told
me
that
your
father
with
the
intuition
of
a
man
of
talent
had
a
glimmering
of
a
notion
of
some
way
of
replacing
linen
rags
with
an
exceedingly
common
vegetable
product
not
previously
manufactured
but
taken
direct
from
the
soil
as
the
chinese
use
vegetable
fibre
at
first
hand
i
have
classified
the
guesses
made
by
those
who
came
before
me
and
have
begun
to
study
the
question
the
bamboo
is
a
kind
of
reed
naturally
i
began
to
think
of
the
reeds
that
grow
here
in
france
labor
is
very
cheap
in
china
where
a
workman
earns
three
halfpence
a
day
and
this
cheapness
of
labor
enables
the
chinese
to
manipulate
each
sheet
of
paper
separately
they
take
it
out
of
the
mould
and
press
it
between
heated
tablets
of
white
porcelain
that
is
the
secret
of
the
surface
and
consistence
the
lightness
and
satin
smoothness
of
the
best
paper
in
the
world
well
here
in
europe
the
work
must
be
done
by
machinery
machinery
must
take
the
place
of
cheap
chinese
labor
if
we
could
but
succeed
in
making
a
cheap
paper
of
as
good
a
quality
the
weight
and
thickness
of
printed
books
would
be
reduced
by
more
than
a
set
of
voltaire
printed
on
our
woven
paper
and
bound
weighs
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
it
would
only
weigh
fifty
if
we
used
chinese
paper
that
surely
would
be
a
triumph
for
the
housing
of
many
books
has
come
to
be
a
difficulty
everything
has
grown
smaller
of
late
this
is
not
an
age
of
giants
men
have
shrunk
everything
about
them
shrinks
and
into
the
bargain
great
mansions
and
great
suites
of
rooms
will
be
abolished
sooner
or
later
in
paris
for
no
one
will
afford
to
live
in
the
great
houses
built
by
our
forefathers
what
a
disgrace
for
our
age
if
none
of
its
books
should
last
dutch
paper
that
is
paper
made
from
flax
will
be
quite
unobtainable
in
ten
years
time
well
your
brother
told
me
of
this
idea
of
your
father
this
plan
for
using
vegetable
fibre
in
so
you
see
that
if
i
succeed
you
have
a
right
to
lucien
came
up
at
that
moment
and
interrupted
david
generous
assertion
i
do
not
know
whether
you
have
found
the
evening
pleasant
said
he
it
has
been
a
cruel
time
for
me
poor
lucien
what
can
have
happened
cried
eve
as
she
saw
her
brother
excited
face
the
poet
told
the
history
of
his
agony
pouring
out
a
flood
of
clamorous
thoughts
into
those
friendly
hearts
eve
and
david
listening
in
pained
silence
to
a
torrent
of
woes
that
exhibited
such
greatness
and
such
pettiness
de
bargeton
is
an
old
dotard
the
indigestion
will
carry
him
off
before
long
no
doubt
lucien
said
as
he
made
an
end
and
then
i
will
look
down
on
these
proud
people
i
will
marry
mme
de
bargeton
i
read
in
her
eyes
a
love
as
great
as
mine
for
her
yes
she
felt
all
that
i
felt
she
comforted
me
she
is
as
great
and
noble
as
she
is
gracious
and
beautiful
she
will
never
give
me
up
it
is
time
that
life
was
made
smooth
for
him
is
it
not
murmured
david
and
for
answer
eve
pressed
his
arm
without
speaking
david
guessed
her
thoughts
and
began
at
once
to
tell
lucien
about
his
own
plans
if
lucien
was
full
of
his
troubles
the
lovers
were
quite
as
full
of
themselves
so
absorbed
were
they
so
eager
that
lucien
should
approve
their
happiness
that
neither
eve
nor
david
so
much
as
noticed
his
start
of
surprise
at
the
news
mme
de
bargeton
lover
had
been
dreaming
of
a
great
match
for
his
sister
he
would
reach
a
high
position
first
and
then
secure
himself
by
an
alliance
with
some
family
of
influence
and
here
was
one
more
obstacle
in
his
way
to
success
his
hopes
were
dashed
to
the
ground
if
mme
de
bargeton
consents
to
be
mme
de
rubempre
she
would
never
care
to
have
david
sechard
for
a
this
stated
clearly
and
precisely
was
the
thought
that
tortured
lucien
inmost
mind
louise
is
right
he
thought
bitterly
a
man
with
a
career
before
him
is
never
understood
by
his
family
if
the
marriage
had
not
been
announced
immediately
after
fancy
had
put
de
bargeton
to
death
he
would
have
been
radiant
with
heartfelt
delight
at
the
news
if
he
had
thought
soberly
over
the
probable
future
of
a
beautiful
and
penniless
girl
like
eve
chardon
he
would
have
seen
that
this
marriage
was
a
piece
of
good
fortune
but
he
was
living
just
now
in
a
golden
dream
he
had
soared
above
all
barriers
on
the
wings
of
an
he
had
seen
a
vision
of
himself
rising
above
society
and
it
was
painful
to
drop
so
suddenly
down
to
hard
fact
eve
and
david
both
thought
that
their
brother
was
overcome
with
the
sense
of
such
generosity
to
them
with
their
noble
natures
the
silent
consent
was
a
sign
of
true
friendship
david
began
to
describe
with
kindly
and
cordial
eloquence
the
happy
fortunes
in
store
for
them
all
unchecked
by
protests
put
in
by
eve
he
furnished
his
first
floor
with
a
lover
lavishness
built
a
second
floor
with
boyish
good
faith
for
lucien
and
rooms
above
the
shed
for
mme
chardon
he
meant
to
be
a
son
to
her
in
short
he
made
the
whole
family
so
happy
and
his
so
independent
that
lucien
fell
under
the
spell
of
david
voice
and
eve
caresses
and
as
they
went
through
the
shadows
beside
the
still
charente
a
gleam
in
the
warm
night
he
forgot
the
sharp
crown
of
thorns
that
had
been
pressed
upon
his
head
de
rubempre
discovered
david
real
nature
in
fact
his
facile
character
returned
almost
at
once
to
the
innocent
burgher
life
that
he
knew
he
saw
it
transfigured
and
free
from
care
the
buzz
of
the
aristocratic
world
grew
more
and
more
remote
and
when
at
length
they
came
upon
the
paved
road
of
the
ambitious
poet
grasped
his
brother
hand
and
made
a
third
in
the
joy
of
the
happy
lovers
if
only
your
father
makes
no
objection
to
the
marriage
he
said
you
know
how
much
he
troubles
himself
about
me
the
old
man
lives
for
himself
said
david
but
i
will
go
over
to
marsac
and
see
him
if
it
is
only
to
ask
leave
to
build
david
went
back
to
the
house
with
the
brother
and
sister
and
asked
mme
chardon
consent
to
his
marriage
with
the
eagerness
of
a
man
who
would
fain
have
no
delay
eve
mother
took
her
daughter
hand
and
gladly
laid
it
in
david
and
the
lover
grown
bolder
on
this
kissed
his
fair
betrothed
on
the
forehead
and
she
flushed
red
and
smiled
at
him
the
betrothal
of
the
poor
the
mother
said
raising
her
eyes
as
if
to
pray
for
heaven
blessing
upon
you
are
brave
my
boy
she
added
looking
at
david
but
we
have
fallen
on
evil
fortune
and
i
am
afraid
lest
our
bad
luck
should
be
infectious
we
shall
be
rich
and
happy
david
said
earnestly
to
begin
with
you
must
not
go
out
nursing
any
more
and
you
must
come
and
live
with
your
daughter
and
lucien
in
angouleme
the
three
began
at
once
to
tell
the
astonished
mother
all
their
charming
plans
and
the
family
party
gave
themselves
up
to
the
pleasure
of
chatting
and
weaving
a
romance
in
which
it
is
so
pleasant
to
enjoy
future
happiness
and
to
store
the
unsown
harvest
they
had
to
put
david
out
at
the
door
he
could
have
wished
the
evening
to
last
for
ever
and
it
was
one
in
the
morning
when
lucien
and
his
future
reached
the
palet
gate
the
unwonted
movement
made
honest
postel
uneasy
he
opened
the
window
and
looking
through
the
venetian
shutters
he
saw
a
light
in
eve
room
what
can
be
happening
at
the
chardons
thought
he
and
seeing
lucien
come
in
he
called
out
to
him
what
is
the
matter
sonny
do
you
want
me
to
do
anything
no
sir
returned
the
poet
but
as
you
are
our
friend
i
can
tell
you
about
it
my
mother
has
just
given
her
consent
to
my
engagement
to
david
sechard
for
all
answer
postel
shut
the
window
with
a
bang
in
despair
that
he
had
not
asked
for
mlle
chardon
earlier
david
however
did
not
go
back
into
angouleme
he
took
the
road
to
marsac
instead
and
walked
through
the
night
the
whole
way
to
his
father
house
he
went
along
by
the
side
of
the
croft
just
as
the
sun
rose
and
caught
sight
of
the
old
bear
face
under
an
that
grew
out
of
the
hedge
good
day
father
called
david
why
is
it
you
my
boy
how
come
you
to
be
out
on
the
road
at
this
time
of
day
there
is
your
way
in
he
added
pointing
to
a
little
wicket
gate
my
vines
have
flowered
and
not
a
shoot
has
been
frosted
there
will
be
twenty
puncheons
or
more
to
the
acre
this
year
but
then
look
at
all
the
dung
that
has
been
put
on
the
land
father
i
have
come
on
important
business
very
well
how
are
your
presses
doing
you
must
be
making
heaps
of
money
as
big
as
yourself
i
shall
some
day
father
but
i
am
not
very
well
off
just
now
they
all
tell
me
that
i
ought
not
to
put
on
so
much
manure
replied
his
father
the
gentry
that
is
le
marquis
le
comte
and
monsieur
say
that
i
am
letting
down
the
quality
of
the
wine
what
is
the
good
of
except
to
muddle
your
wits
just
you
listen
these
gentlemen
get
seven
or
sometimes
eight
puncheons
of
wine
to
the
acre
and
they
sell
them
for
sixty
francs
apiece
that
means
four
hundred
francs
per
acre
at
most
in
a
good
year
now
i
make
twenty
puncheons
and
get
thirty
francs
apiece
for
them
that
is
six
hundred
francs
and
where
are
they
the
fools
quality
quality
what
is
quality
to
me
they
can
keep
their
quality
for
themselves
these
lord
marquises
quality
means
hard
cash
for
me
that
is
what
it
means
you
were
saying
i
am
going
to
be
married
father
and
i
have
come
to
ask
for
ask
me
for
what
nothing
of
the
sort
my
boy
marry
i
give
you
my
consent
but
as
for
giving
you
anything
else
i
have
a
penny
to
bless
myself
with
dressing
the
soil
is
the
ruin
of
me
these
two
years
i
have
been
paying
money
out
of
pocket
for
and
taxes
and
expenses
of
all
kinds
government
eats
up
everything
nearly
all
the
profit
goes
to
the
government
the
poor
growers
have
made
nothing
these
last
two
seasons
this
year
things
do
look
so
bad
and
of
course
the
beggarly
puncheons
have
gone
up
to
eleven
francs
already
we
work
to
put
money
into
the
coopers
pockets
why
are
you
going
to
marry
before
the
vintage
i
only
came
to
ask
for
your
consent
father
oh
that
is
another
thing
and
who
is
the
victim
if
one
may
ask
i
am
going
to
marry
mlle
eve
chardon
who
may
she
be
what
kind
of
victual
does
she
eat
she
is
the
daughter
of
the
late
chardon
the
druggist
in
you
are
going
to
marry
a
girl
out
of
a
burgess
of
angouleme
and
printer
to
his
majesty
this
is
what
comes
of
send
a
boy
to
school
forsooth
oh
well
then
she
is
very
rich
is
she
my
boy
and
the
old
vinegrower
came
up
closer
with
a
cajoling
manner
if
you
are
marrying
a
girl
out
of
it
must
be
because
she
has
lots
of
cash
eh
good
you
will
pay
me
my
rent
now
there
are
two
years
and
owing
you
know
my
boy
that
is
two
thousand
seven
hundred
francs
altogether
the
money
will
come
just
in
the
nick
of
time
to
pay
the
cooper
if
it
was
anybody
else
i
should
have
a
right
to
ask
for
interest
for
after
all
business
is
business
but
i
will
let
you
off
the
interest
well
how
much
has
she
just
as
much
as
my
mother
had
the
old
vinegrower
very
nearly
said
then
she
has
only
ten
thousand
francs
but
he
recollected
just
in
time
that
he
had
declined
to
give
an
account
of
her
fortune
to
her
son
and
exclaimed
she
has
nothing
my
mother
fortune
was
her
beauty
and
intelligence
said
david
you
just
go
into
the
market
and
see
what
you
can
get
for
it
bless
my
buttons
what
bad
luck
parents
have
with
their
children
david
when
i
married
i
had
a
paper
cap
on
my
head
for
my
whole
fortune
and
a
pair
of
arms
i
was
a
poor
pressman
but
with
the
fine
that
i
gave
you
with
your
industry
and
your
education
you
might
marry
a
burgess
daughter
a
woman
with
thirty
or
forty
thousand
francs
give
up
your
fancy
and
i
will
find
you
a
wife
myself
there
is
some
one
about
three
miles
away
a
miller
widow
years
old
with
a
hundred
thousand
francs
in
land
there
is
your
chance
you
can
add
her
property
to
marsac
for
they
touch
ah
what
a
fine
property
we
should
have
and
how
i
would
look
after
it
they
say
she
is
going
to
marry
her
foreman
courtois
but
you
are
the
better
man
of
the
two
i
would
look
after
the
mill
and
she
should
live
like
a
lady
up
in
angouleme
i
am
engaged
father
david
you
know
nothing
of
business
you
will
ruin
yourself
i
see
yes
if
you
marry
this
girl
out
of
i
shall
square
accounts
and
summons
you
for
the
rent
for
i
see
that
no
good
will
come
of
this
oh
my
presses
my
poor
presses
it
took
some
money
to
grease
you
and
keep
you
going
nothing
but
a
good
year
can
comfort
me
after
this
it
seems
to
me
father
that
until
now
i
have
given
you
very
little
trouble
and
paid
mighty
little
rent
put
in
his
parent
i
came
to
ask
you
something
else
besides
will
you
build
a
second
floor
to
your
house
and
some
rooms
above
the
shed
deuce
a
bit
of
it
i
have
not
the
cash
and
that
you
know
right
well
besides
it
would
be
money
thrown
clean
away
for
what
would
it
bring
in
oh
you
get
up
early
of
a
morning
to
come
and
ask
me
to
build
you
a
place
that
would
ruin
a
king
do
you
your
name
may
be
david
but
i
have
not
got
solomon
treasury
why
you
are
mad
or
they
changed
my
child
at
nurse
there
is
one
for
you
that
will
have
grapes
on
it
he
said
interrupting
himself
to
point
out
a
shoot
offspring
of
this
sort
do
disappoint
their
parents
you
dung
the
vines
and
they
repay
you
for
it
i
sent
you
to
school
i
spent
any
amount
of
money
to
make
a
scholar
of
you
i
sent
you
to
the
didots
to
learn
your
business
and
all
this
fancy
education
ends
in
a
out
of
without
a
penny
to
her
name
if
you
had
not
studied
books
if
i
had
kept
you
under
my
eye
you
would
have
done
as
i
pleased
and
you
would
be
marrying
a
miller
widow
this
day
with
a
hundred
thousand
francs
in
hand
to
say
nothing
of
the
mill
oh
your
cleverness
leads
you
to
imagine
that
i
am
going
to
reward
this
fine
sentiment
by
building
palaces
for
you
does
it
really
anybody
might
think
that
the
house
that
has
been
a
house
these
two
hundred
years
was
nothing
but
a
pigsty
not
fit
for
the
girl
out
of
to
sleep
in
what
next
she
is
the
queen
of
france
i
suppose
very
well
father
i
will
build
the
second
floor
myself
the
son
will
improve
his
father
property
it
is
not
the
usual
way
but
it
happens
so
sometimes
what
my
lad
you
can
find
money
for
building
can
you
though
you
ca
find
money
to
pay
the
rent
eh
you
sly
dog
to
come
round
your
father
the
question
thus
raised
was
hard
to
lay
for
the
old
man
was
only
too
delighted
to
seize
an
opportunity
of
posing
as
a
good
father
without
disbursing
a
penny
and
all
that
david
could
obtain
was
his
bare
consent
to
the
marriage
and
free
leave
to
do
what
he
liked
in
the
house
at
his
own
expense
the
old
bear
that
pattern
of
a
thrifty
parent
kindly
consenting
not
to
demand
the
rent
and
drain
the
savings
to
which
david
imprudently
owned
david
went
back
again
in
low
spirits
he
saw
that
he
could
not
reckon
on
his
father
help
in
misfortune
in
angouleme
that
day
people
talked
of
nothing
but
the
epigram
and
mme
de
bargeton
reply
every
least
thing
that
happened
that
evening
was
so
much
exaggerated
and
embellished
and
twisted
out
of
all
knowledge
that
the
poet
became
the
hero
of
the
hour
while
this
storm
in
a
teacup
raged
on
high
a
few
drops
fell
among
the
young
men
looked
enviously
after
lucien
as
he
passed
on
his
way
through
beaulieu
and
he
overheard
chance
phrases
that
filled
him
with
conceit
there
is
a
lucky
young
fellow
said
an
attorney
clerk
named
a
youth
who
had
been
at
school
with
lucien
and
treated
him
with
small
patronizing
airs
yes
he
certainly
is
answered
one
of
the
young
men
who
had
been
present
on
the
occasion
of
the
reading
he
is
a
fellow
he
has
some
brains
and
mme
de
bargeton
is
quite
wild
about
him
lucien
had
waited
impatiently
until
he
could
be
sure
of
finding
louise
alone
he
had
to
break
the
tidings
of
his
sister
marriage
to
the
arbitress
of
his
destinies
perhaps
after
yesterday
soiree
louise
would
be
kinder
than
usual
and
her
kindness
might
lead
to
a
moment
of
happiness
so
he
thought
and
he
was
not
mistaken
mme
de
bargeton
met
him
with
a
vehemence
of
sentiment
that
seemed
like
a
touching
progress
of
passion
to
the
novice
in
love
she
abandoned
her
hands
her
beautiful
golden
hair
to
the
burning
kisses
of
the
poet
who
had
passed
through
such
an
ordeal
if
only
you
could
have
seen
your
face
whilst
you
were
reading
cried
louise
using
the
familiar
the
caress
of
speech
since
yesterday
while
her
white
hands
wiped
the
pearls
of
sweat
from
the
brows
on
which
she
set
a
poet
crown
there
were
sparks
of
fire
in
those
beautiful
eyes
from
your
lips
as
i
watched
them
there
fell
the
golden
chains
that
suspend
the
hearts
of
men
upon
the
poet
mouth
you
shall
read
chenier
through
to
me
from
beginning
to
end
he
is
the
lover
poet
you
shall
not
be
unhappy
any
longer
i
will
not
have
it
yes
dear
angel
i
will
make
an
oasis
for
you
there
you
shall
live
your
poet
life
sometimes
busy
sometimes
languid
indolent
full
of
work
and
musing
by
turns
but
never
forget
that
you
owe
your
laurels
to
me
let
that
thought
be
my
noble
guerdon
for
the
sufferings
which
i
must
endure
poor
love
the
world
will
not
spare
me
any
more
than
it
has
spared
you
the
world
is
avenged
on
all
happiness
in
which
it
has
no
share
yes
i
shall
always
be
a
mark
for
envy
did
you
not
see
that
last
night
the
bloodthirsty
insects
are
quick
enough
to
drain
every
wound
that
they
pierce
but
i
was
happy
i
lived
it
is
so
long
since
all
my
heartstrings
vibrated
the
tears
flowed
fast
and
for
all
answer
lucien
took
louise
hand
and
gave
it
a
lingering
kiss
every
one
about
him
soothed
and
caressed
the
poet
vanity
his
mother
and
his
sister
and
david
and
louise
now
did
the
same
every
one
helped
to
raise
the
imaginary
pedestal
on
which
he
had
set
himself
his
friends
kindness
and
the
fury
of
his
enemies
combined
to
establish
him
more
firmly
in
an
ureal
world
a
young
imagination
readily
falls
in
with
the
flattering
estimates
of
others
a
handsome
young
fellow
so
full
of
promise
finds
others
eager
to
help
him
on
every
side
and
only
after
one
or
two
sharp
and
bitter
lessons
does
he
begin
to
see
himself
as
an
ordinary
mortal
my
beautiful
louise
do
you
mean
in
very
truth
to
be
my
beatrice
a
beatrice
who
condescends
to
be
loved
louise
raised
the
fine
eyes
hitherto
if
you
show
yourself
worthy
some
day
she
said
with
an
angelic
smile
which
belied
her
words
are
you
not
happy
to
be
the
sole
possessor
of
a
heart
to
speak
freely
at
all
times
with
the
certainty
of
being
understood
is
not
this
happiness
yes
he
answered
with
a
lover
pout
of
vexation
child
she
exclaimed
laughing
at
him
come
you
have
something
to
tell
me
have
you
not
you
came
in
absorbed
in
thought
my
lucien
lucien
in
fear
and
trembling
confided
to
his
beloved
that
david
was
in
love
with
his
sister
eve
and
that
his
sister
eve
was
in
love
with
david
and
that
the
two
were
to
be
married
shortly
poor
lucien
said
louise
he
was
afraid
he
should
be
beaten
and
scolded
as
if
it
was
he
himself
that
was
going
to
be
married
why
where
is
the
harm
she
continued
her
fingers
toying
with
hair
what
is
your
family
to
me
when
you
are
an
exception
suppose
that
my
father
were
to
marry
his
cook
would
that
trouble
you
much
dear
boy
lovers
are
for
each
other
their
whole
family
have
i
a
greater
interest
than
my
lucien
in
the
world
be
great
find
the
way
to
win
fame
that
is
our
affair
this
selfish
answer
made
lucien
the
happiest
of
mortals
but
in
the
middle
of
the
fantastic
reasonings
with
which
louise
convinced
him
that
they
two
were
alone
in
the
world
in
came
de
bargeton
lucien
frowned
and
seemed
to
be
taken
aback
but
louise
made
him
a
sign
and
asked
him
to
stay
to
dinner
and
to
read
andre
de
chenier
aloud
to
them
until
people
arrived
for
their
evening
game
at
cards
you
will
give
her
pleasure
said
de
bargeton
and
me
also
nothing
suits
me
better
than
listening
to
reading
aloud
after
dinner
cajoled
by
de
bargeton
cajoled
by
louise
waited
upon
with
the
respect
which
servants
show
to
a
favored
guest
of
the
house
lucien
remained
in
the
hotel
de
bargeton
and
began
to
think
of
the
luxuries
which
he
enjoyed
for
the
time
being
as
the
rightful
accessories
of
lucien
de
rubempre
he
felt
his
position
so
strong
through
love
and
de
bargeton
weakness
that
as
the
rooms
filled
he
assumed
a
lordly
air
which
that
fair
lady
encouraged
he
tasted
the
delights
of
despotic
sway
which
nais
had
acquired
by
right
of
conquest
and
liked
to
share
with
him
and
in
short
that
evening
he
tried
to
act
up
to
the
part
of
the
lion
of
the
little
town
a
few
of
those
who
marked
these
airs
drew
their
own
conclusions
from
them
and
thought
that
according
to
the
old
expression
he
had
come
to
the
last
term
with
the
lady
amelie
who
had
come
with
du
chatelet
was
sure
of
the
deplorable
fact
in
a
corner
of
the
where
the
jealous
and
envious
gathered
together
do
not
think
of
calling
nais
to
account
for
the
vanity
of
a
youngster
who
is
as
proud
as
he
can
be
because
he
has
got
into
society
where
he
never
expected
to
set
foot
said
chatelet
you
see
that
this
chardon
takes
the
civility
of
a
woman
of
the
world
for
an
advance
he
does
not
know
the
difference
between
the
silence
of
real
passion
and
the
patronizing
graciousness
due
to
his
good
looks
and
youth
and
talent
it
would
be
too
bad
if
women
were
blamed
for
all
the
desires
which
they
inspire
certainly
is
in
love
with
her
but
as
for
nais
oh
nais
echoed
the
perfidious
amelie
nais
is
well
enough
pleased
a
young
man
love
has
so
many
attractions
at
her
age
a
woman
grows
young
again
in
his
company
she
is
a
girl
and
acts
a
girl
hesitation
and
manners
and
does
not
dream
that
she
is
ridiculous
just
look
think
of
a
druggist
son
giving
himself
a
conqueror
airs
with
mme
de
bargeton
love
knows
nought
of
high
or
low
degree
hummed
adrien
there
was
not
a
single
house
in
angouleme
next
day
where
the
degree
of
intimacy
between
chardon
alias
de
rubempre
and
mme
de
bargeton
was
not
discussed
and
though
the
utmost
extent
of
their
guilt
amounted
to
two
or
three
kisses
the
world
already
chose
to
believe
the
worst
of
both
mme
de
bargeton
paid
the
penalty
of
her
sovereignty
among
the
various
eccentricities
of
society
have
you
never
noticed
its
erratic
judgments
and
the
unaccountable
differences
in
the
standard
it
requires
of
this
or
that
man
or
woman
there
are
some
persons
who
may
do
anything
they
may
behave
totally
irrationally
anything
becomes
them
and
it
is
who
shall
be
first
to
justify
their
conduct
then
on
the
other
hand
there
are
those
on
whom
the
world
is
unaccountably
severe
they
must
do
everything
well
they
are
not
allowed
to
fail
nor
to
make
mistakes
at
their
peril
they
do
anything
foolish
you
might
compare
these
last
to
the
statues
which
must
come
down
at
once
from
their
pedestal
if
the
frost
chips
off
a
nose
or
a
finger
they
are
not
permitted
to
be
human
they
are
required
to
be
for
ever
divine
and
for
ever
impeccable
so
one
glance
exchanged
between
mme
de
bargeton
and
lucien
outweighed
twelve
years
of
zizine
connection
with
francis
in
the
social
balance
and
a
squeeze
of
the
hand
drew
down
all
the
thunders
of
the
charente
upon
the
lovers
david
had
brought
a
little
secret
hoard
back
with
him
from
paris
and
it
was
this
sum
that
he
set
aside
for
the
expenses
of
his
marriage
and
for
the
building
of
the
second
floor
in
his
father
house
his
father
house
it
was
but
after
all
was
he
not
working
for
himself
it
would
all
be
his
again
some
day
and
his
father
was
years
old
so
david
build
a
timbered
second
story
for
lucien
so
as
not
to
put
too
great
a
strain
on
the
old
rifted
he
took
pleasure
in
making
the
rooms
where
the
fair
eve
was
to
spend
her
life
as
brave
as
might
be
it
was
a
time
of
blithe
and
unmixed
happiness
for
the
friends
lucien
was
tired
of
the
shabbiness
of
provincial
life
and
weary
of
the
sordid
frugality
that
looked
on
a
piece
as
a
fortune
but
he
bore
the
hardships
and
the
pinching
thrift
without
grumbling
his
moody
looks
had
been
succeeded
by
an
expression
of
radiant
hope
he
saw
the
star
shining
above
his
head
he
had
dreams
of
a
great
time
to
come
and
built
the
fabric
of
his
good
fortune
on
de
tomb
de
bargeton
troubled
with
indigestion
from
time
to
time
cherished
the
happy
delusion
that
indigestion
after
dinner
was
a
complaint
to
be
cured
by
a
hearty
supper
by
the
beginning
of
september
lucien
had
ceased
to
be
a
foreman
he
was
de
rubempre
housed
sumptuously
in
comparison
with
his
late
quarters
in
the
tumbledown
attic
with
the
where
young
chardon
had
lived
in
he
was
not
even
a
man
of
he
lived
in
the
heights
of
angouleme
and
dined
four
times
a
week
with
mme
de
bargeton
a
friendship
had
grown
up
between
de
rubempre
and
the
bishop
and
he
went
to
the
palace
his
occupations
put
him
upon
a
level
with
the
highest
rank
his
name
would
be
one
day
among
the
great
names
of
france
and
in
truth
as
he
went
to
and
fro
in
his
apartments
the
pretty
the
charming
bedroom
and
the
tastefully
furnished
study
he
might
console
himself
for
the
thought
that
he
drew
thirty
francs
every
month
out
of
his
mother
and
sister
hard
earnings
for
he
saw
the
day
approaching
when
archer
of
charles
the
historical
romance
on
which
he
had
been
at
work
for
two
years
and
a
volume
of
verse
entitled
should
spread
his
fame
through
the
world
of
literature
and
bring
in
money
enough
to
repay
them
all
his
mother
and
sister
and
david
so
grown
great
in
his
own
eyes
and
giving
ear
to
the
echoes
of
his
name
in
the
future
he
could
accept
present
sacrifices
with
noble
assurance
he
smiled
at
his
poverty
he
relished
the
sense
of
these
last
days
of
penury
eve
and
david
had
set
lucien
happiness
before
their
own
they
had
put
off
their
wedding
for
it
took
some
time
to
paper
and
paint
their
rooms
and
to
buy
the
furniture
and
lucien
affairs
had
been
settled
first
no
one
who
knew
lucien
could
wonder
at
their
devotion
lucien
was
so
engaging
he
had
such
winning
ways
his
impatience
and
his
desires
were
so
graciously
expressed
that
his
cause
was
always
won
before
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
this
unlucky
gift
of
fortune
if
it
is
the
salvation
of
some
is
the
ruin
of
many
more
lucien
and
his
like
find
a
world
predisposed
in
favor
of
youth
and
good
looks
and
ready
to
protect
those
who
give
it
pleasure
with
the
selfish
that
flings
alms
to
a
beggar
if
he
appeals
to
the
feelings
and
awakens
emotion
and
in
this
favor
many
a
grown
child
is
content
to
bask
instead
of
putting
it
to
a
profitable
use
with
mistaken
notions
as
to
the
significance
and
the
motive
of
social
relations
they
imagine
that
they
shall
always
meet
with
deceptive
smiles
and
so
at
last
the
moment
comes
for
them
when
the
world
leaves
them
bald
stripped
bare
without
fortune
or
worth
like
an
elderly
coquette
by
the
door
of
a
salon
or
a
stray
rag
in
the
gutter
eve
herself
had
wished
for
the
delay
she
meant
to
establish
the
little
household
on
the
most
economical
footing
and
to
buy
only
strict
necessaries
but
what
could
two
lovers
refuse
to
a
brother
who
watched
his
sister
at
her
work
and
said
in
tones
that
came
from
the
heart
how
i
wish
i
could
sew
the
sober
observant
david
had
shared
in
the
devotion
and
yet
since
lucien
triumph
david
had
watched
him
with
misgivings
he
was
afraid
that
lucien
would
change
towards
them
afraid
that
he
would
look
down
upon
their
homely
ways
once
or
twice
to
try
his
brother
david
had
made
him
choose
between
home
pleasures
and
the
great
world
and
saw
that
lucien
gave
up
the
delights
of
vanity
for
them
and
exclaimed
to
himself
they
will
not
spoil
him
for
us
now
and
again
the
three
friends
and
mme
chardon
arranged
picnic
parties
in
provincial
fashion
a
walk
in
the
woods
along
the
charente
not
far
from
angouleme
and
dinner
out
on
the
grass
david
apprentice
bringing
the
basket
of
provisions
to
some
place
appointed
and
at
night
they
would
come
back
tired
somewhat
but
the
whole
excursion
had
not
cost
three
francs
on
great
occasion
when
they
dined
at
a
as
it
is
called
a
sort
of
a
country
inn
a
compromise
between
a
provincial
wineshop
and
a
parisian
they
would
spend
as
much
as
five
francs
divided
between
david
and
the
chardons
david
gave
his
brother
infinite
credit
for
forsaking
mme
de
bargeton
and
grand
dinners
for
these
days
in
the
country
and
the
whole
party
made
much
of
the
great
man
of
angouleme
matters
had
gone
so
far
that
the
new
home
was
very
nearly
ready
and
david
had
gone
over
to
marsac
to
persuade
his
father
to
come
to
the
wedding
not
without
a
hope
that
the
old
man
might
relent
at
the
sight
of
his
and
give
something
towards
the
heavy
expenses
of
the
alterations
when
there
befell
one
of
those
events
which
entirely
change
the
face
of
things
in
a
small
town
lucien
and
louise
had
a
spy
in
chatelet
a
spy
who
watched
with
the
persistence
of
a
hate
in
which
avarice
and
passion
are
blended
for
an
opportunity
of
making
a
scandal
sixte
meant
that
mme
de
bargeton
should
compromise
herself
with
lucien
in
such
a
way
that
she
should
be
lost
as
the
saying
goes
so
he
posed
as
mme
de
bargeton
humble
confidant
admired
lucien
in
the
rue
du
minage
and
pulled
him
to
pieces
everywhere
else
nais
had
gradually
given
him
petites
in
the
language
of
the
court
for
the
lady
no
longer
mistrusted
her
elderly
admirer
but
chatelet
had
taken
too
much
for
granted
love
was
still
in
the
platonic
stage
to
the
great
despair
of
louise
and
lucien
there
are
for
that
matter
love
affairs
which
start
with
a
good
or
a
bad
beginning
as
you
prefer
to
take
it
two
creatures
launch
into
the
tactics
of
sentiment
they
talk
when
they
should
be
acting
and
skirmish
in
the
open
instead
of
settling
down
to
a
siege
and
so
they
grow
tired
of
one
another
expend
their
longings
in
empty
space
and
having
time
for
reflection
come
to
their
own
conclusions
about
each
other
many
a
passion
that
has
taken
the
field
in
gorgeous
array
with
colors
flying
and
an
ardor
fit
to
turn
the
world
upside
down
has
turned
home
again
without
a
victory
inglorious
and
crestfallen
cutting
but
a
foolish
figure
after
these
vain
alarums
and
excursions
such
mishaps
are
sometimes
due
to
the
diffidence
of
youth
sometimes
to
the
demurs
of
an
inexperienced
woman
for
old
players
at
this
game
seldom
end
in
a
fiasco
of
this
kind
provincial
life
moreover
is
singularly
well
calculated
to
keep
desire
unsatisfied
and
maintain
a
lover
arguments
on
the
intellectual
plane
while
at
the
same
time
the
very
obstacles
placed
in
the
way
of
the
sweet
intercourse
which
binds
lovers
so
closely
each
to
each
hurry
ardent
souls
on
towards
extreme
measures
a
system
of
espionage
of
the
most
minute
and
intricate
kind
underlies
provincial
life
every
house
is
transparent
the
solace
of
close
friendships
which
break
no
moral
law
is
scarcely
allowed
and
such
outrageously
scandalous
constructions
are
put
upon
the
most
innocent
human
intercourse
that
many
a
woman
character
is
taken
away
without
cause
one
here
and
there
weighed
down
by
her
unmerited
punishment
will
regret
that
she
has
never
known
to
the
full
the
forbidden
felicity
for
which
she
is
suffering
the
world
which
blames
and
criticises
with
a
superficial
knowledge
of
the
patent
facts
in
which
a
long
inward
struggle
ends
is
in
reality
a
prime
agent
in
bringing
such
scandals
about
and
those
whose
voices
are
loudest
in
condemnation
of
the
alleged
misconduct
of
some
slandered
woman
never
give
a
thought
to
the
immediate
provocation
of
the
overt
step
that
step
many
a
woman
only
takes
after
she
has
been
unjustly
accused
and
condemned
and
mme
de
bargeton
was
now
on
the
verge
of
this
anomalous
position
the
obstacles
at
the
outset
of
a
passion
of
this
kind
are
alarming
to
inexperience
and
those
in
the
way
of
the
two
lovers
were
very
like
the
bonds
by
which
the
population
of
lilliput
throttled
gulliver
a
multiplicity
of
nothings
which
made
all
movement
impossible
and
baffle
the
most
vehement
desires
mme
de
bargeton
for
instance
must
always
be
visible
if
she
had
denied
herself
to
visitors
when
lucien
was
with
her
it
would
have
been
all
over
with
her
she
might
as
well
have
run
away
with
him
at
once
it
is
true
that
they
sat
in
the
boudoir
now
grown
so
familiar
to
lucien
that
he
felt
as
if
he
had
a
right
to
be
there
but
the
doors
stood
scrupulously
open
and
everything
was
arranged
with
the
utmost
propriety
de
bargeton
pervaded
the
house
like
a
cockchafer
it
never
entered
his
head
that
his
wife
could
wish
to
be
alone
with
lucien
if
he
had
been
the
only
person
in
the
way
nais
could
have
got
rid
of
him
sent
him
out
of
the
house
or
given
him
something
to
do
but
he
was
not
the
only
one
visitors
flocked
in
upon
her
and
so
much
the
more
as
curiosity
increased
for
your
provincial
has
a
natural
bent
for
teasing
and
delights
to
thwart
a
growing
passion
the
servants
came
and
went
about
the
house
promiscuously
and
without
a
summons
they
had
formed
the
habits
with
a
mistress
who
had
nothing
to
conceal
any
change
now
made
in
her
household
ways
was
tantamount
to
a
confession
and
angouleme
still
hung
in
doubt
mme
de
bargeton
could
not
set
foot
outside
her
house
but
the
whole
town
knew
whither
she
was
going
to
take
a
walk
alone
with
lucien
out
of
angouleme
would
have
been
a
decided
measure
indeed
it
would
have
been
less
dangerous
to
shut
herself
up
with
him
in
the
house
there
would
have
been
comments
the
next
day
if
lucien
had
stayed
on
till
midnight
after
the
rooms
were
emptied
within
as
without
her
house
mme
de
bargeton
lived
in
public
these
details
describe
life
in
the
provinces
an
intrigue
is
either
openly
avoided
or
impossible
anywhere
like
all
women
carried
away
for
the
first
time
by
passion
louise
discovered
the
difficulties
of
her
position
one
by
one
they
frightened
her
and
her
terror
reacted
upon
the
fond
talk
that
fills
the
fairest
hours
which
lovers
spend
alone
together
mme
de
bargeton
had
no
country
house
whither
she
could
take
her
beloved
poet
after
the
manner
of
some
women
who
will
forge
ingenious
pretexts
for
burying
themselves
in
the
wilderness
but
weary
of
living
in
public
and
pushed
to
extremities
by
a
tyranny
which
afforded
no
pleasures
sweet
enough
to
compensate
for
the
heaviness
of
the
yoke
she
even
thought
of
escarbas
and
of
going
to
see
her
aged
father
so
much
irritated
was
she
by
these
paltry
obstacles
chatelet
did
not
believe
in
such
innocence
he
lay
in
wait
and
watched
lucien
into
the
house
and
followed
a
few
minutes
later
always
taking
de
chandour
the
most
indiscreet
person
in
the
clique
along
with
him
and
putting
that
gentleman
first
hoped
to
find
a
surprise
by
such
perseverance
in
pursuit
of
the
chance
his
own
part
was
a
very
difficult
one
to
play
and
its
success
was
the
more
doubtful
because
he
was
bound
to
appear
neutral
if
he
was
to
prompt
the
other
actors
who
were
to
play
in
his
drama
so
to
give
himself
a
countenance
he
had
attached
himself
to
the
jealous
amelie
the
better
to
lull
suspicion
in
lucien
and
in
mme
de
bargeton
who
was
not
without
perspicacity
in
order
to
spy
upon
the
pair
he
had
contrived
of
late
to
open
up
a
stock
controversy
on
the
point
with
de
chandour
chatelet
said
that
mme
de
bargeton
was
simply
amusing
herself
with
lucien
she
was
too
proud
too
to
stoop
to
the
apothecary
son
the
role
of
incredulity
was
in
accordance
with
the
plan
which
he
had
laid
down
for
he
wished
to
appear
as
mme
de
bargeton
champion
stanislas
de
chandour
held
that
mme
de
bargeton
had
not
been
cruel
to
her
lover
and
amelie
goaded
them
to
argument
for
she
longed
to
know
the
truth
each
stated
his
case
and
as
not
unfrequently
happens
in
small
country
towns
some
intimate
friends
of
the
house
dropped
in
in
the
middle
of
the
argument
stanislas
and
chatelet
vied
with
each
other
in
backing
up
their
opinions
by
observations
extremely
pertinent
it
was
hardly
to
be
expected
that
the
champions
should
not
seek
to
enlist
partisans
what
do
you
yourself
think
they
asked
each
of
his
neighbor
these
polemics
kept
mme
de
bargeton
and
lucien
well
in
sight
at
length
one
day
chatelet
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
whenever
he
went
with
de
chandour
to
mme
de
bargeton
and
found
lucien
there
there
was
not
a
sign
nor
a
trace
of
anything
suspicious
the
boudoir
door
stood
open
the
servants
came
and
went
there
was
nothing
mysterious
to
betray
the
sweet
crime
of
love
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
stanislas
who
did
not
lack
a
certain
spice
of
stupidity
in
his
composition
vowed
that
he
would
cross
the
room
on
tiptoe
the
next
day
and
the
perfidious
amelie
held
him
to
his
bargain
for
lucien
that
morrow
was
the
day
on
which
a
young
man
tugs
out
some
of
the
hairs
of
his
head
and
inwardly
vows
that
he
will
give
up
the
foolish
business
of
sighing
he
was
accustomed
to
his
situation
the
poet
who
had
seated
himself
so
bashfully
in
the
of
the
queen
of
angouleme
had
been
transformed
into
an
urgent
lover
six
months
had
been
enough
to
bring
him
on
a
level
with
louise
and
now
he
would
fain
be
her
lord
and
master
he
left
home
with
a
settled
determination
to
be
extravagant
in
his
behavior
he
would
say
that
it
was
a
matter
of
life
or
death
to
him
he
would
bring
all
the
resources
of
torrid
eloquence
into
play
he
would
cry
that
he
had
lost
his
head
that
he
could
not
think
could
not
write
a
line
the
horror
that
some
women
feel
for
premeditation
does
honor
to
their
delicacy
they
would
rather
surrender
upon
the
impulse
of
passion
than
in
fulfilment
of
a
contract
in
general
prescribed
happiness
is
not
the
kind
that
any
of
us
desire
mme
de
bargeton
read
fixed
purpose
in
lucien
eyes
and
forehead
and
in
the
agitation
in
his
face
and
manner
and
proposed
to
herself
to
baffle
him
urged
thereto
partly
by
a
spirit
of
contradiction
partly
also
by
an
exalted
conception
of
love
being
given
to
exaggeration
she
set
an
exaggerated
value
upon
her
person
she
looked
upon
herself
as
a
sovereign
lady
a
beatrice
a
laura
she
enthroned
herself
like
some
dame
of
the
middle
ages
upon
a
dais
looking
down
upon
the
tourney
of
literature
and
meant
that
lucien
as
in
duty
bound
should
win
her
by
his
prowess
in
the
field
he
must
eclipse
the
sublime
child
and
lamartine
and
sir
walter
scott
and
byron
the
noble
creature
regarded
her
love
as
a
stimulating
power
the
desire
which
she
had
kindled
in
lucien
should
give
him
the
energy
to
win
glory
for
himself
this
feminine
quixotry
is
a
sentiment
which
hallows
love
and
turns
it
to
worthy
uses
it
exalts
and
reverences
love
mme
de
bargeton
having
made
up
her
mind
to
play
the
part
of
dulcinea
in
lucien
life
for
seven
or
eight
years
to
come
desired
like
many
other
provincials
to
give
herself
as
the
reward
of
prolonged
service
a
trial
of
constancy
which
should
give
her
time
to
judge
her
lover
lucien
began
the
strife
by
a
piece
of
vehement
petulence
at
which
a
woman
laughs
so
long
as
she
is
and
saddens
only
when
she
loves
whereupon
louise
took
a
lofty
tone
and
began
one
of
her
long
orations
interlarded
with
words
was
that
your
promise
to
me
lucien
she
said
as
she
made
an
end
do
not
sow
regrets
in
the
present
time
so
sweet
as
it
is
to
poison
my
after
life
do
not
spoil
the
future
and
i
say
it
with
pride
do
not
spoil
the
present
is
not
my
whole
heart
yours
what
more
must
you
have
can
it
be
that
your
love
is
influenced
by
the
clamor
of
the
senses
when
it
is
the
noblest
privilege
of
the
beloved
to
silence
them
for
whom
do
you
take
me
am
i
not
your
beatrice
if
i
am
not
something
more
than
a
woman
for
you
i
am
less
than
a
woman
that
is
just
what
you
might
say
to
a
man
if
you
cared
nothing
at
all
for
him
cried
lucien
frantic
with
passion
if
you
can
not
feel
all
the
sincere
love
underlying
my
ideas
you
will
never
be
worthy
of
me
you
are
throwing
doubts
on
my
love
to
dispense
yourself
from
responding
to
it
cried
lucien
and
he
flung
himself
weeping
at
her
feet
the
poor
boy
cried
in
earnest
at
the
prospect
of
remaining
so
long
at
the
gate
of
paradise
the
tears
of
the
poet
who
feels
that
he
is
humbled
through
his
strength
were
mingled
with
childish
crying
for
a
plaything
you
have
never
loved
me
he
cried
you
do
not
believe
what
you
say
she
answered
flattered
by
his
violence
then
give
me
proof
that
you
are
mine
said
the
disheveled
poet
just
at
that
moment
stanislas
came
up
unheard
by
either
of
the
pair
he
beheld
lucien
in
tears
half
reclining
on
the
floor
with
his
head
on
louise
knee
the
attitude
was
suspicious
enough
to
satisfy
stanislas
he
turned
sharply
round
upon
chatelet
who
stood
at
the
door
of
the
salon
mme
de
bargeton
sprang
up
in
a
moment
but
the
spies
beat
a
precipate
retreat
like
intruders
and
she
was
not
quick
enough
for
them
who
came
just
now
she
asked
the
servants
de
chandour
and
du
chatelet
said
gentil
her
old
footman
mme
de
bargeton
went
back
pale
and
trembling
to
her
boudoir
if
they
saw
you
just
now
i
am
lost
she
told
lucien
so
much
the
better
exclaimed
the
poet
and
she
smiled
to
hear
the
cry
so
full
of
selfish
love
a
story
of
this
kind
is
aggravated
in
the
provinces
by
the
way
in
which
it
is
told
everybody
knew
in
a
moment
that
lucien
had
been
detected
at
nais
feet
de
chandour
elated
by
the
important
part
he
played
in
the
affair
went
first
to
tell
the
great
news
at
the
club
and
thence
from
house
to
house
chatelet
hastening
to
say
that
had
seen
nothing
but
by
putting
himself
out
of
court
he
egged
stanislas
on
to
talk
he
drew
him
on
to
add
fresh
details
and
stanislas
thinking
himself
very
witty
added
a
little
to
the
tale
every
time
that
he
told
it
every
one
flocked
to
amelie
house
that
evening
for
by
that
time
the
most
exaggerated
versions
of
the
story
were
in
circulation
among
the
angouleme
nobility
every
narrator
having
followed
stanislas
example
women
and
men
were
alike
impatient
to
know
the
truth
and
the
women
who
put
their
hands
before
their
faces
and
shrieked
the
loudest
were
none
other
than
mesdames
amelie
zephirine
fifine
and
lolotte
all
with
more
or
less
heavy
indictments
of
illicit
love
laid
to
their
charge
there
were
variations
in
every
key
upon
the
painful
theme
well
well
said
one
of
the
ladies
poor
nais
have
you
heard
about
it
i
do
not
believe
it
myself
she
has
a
whole
blameless
record
behind
her
she
is
far
too
proud
to
be
anything
but
a
patroness
to
chardon
still
if
it
is
true
i
pity
her
with
all
my
heart
she
is
all
the
more
to
be
pitied
because
she
is
making
herself
frightfully
ridiculous
she
is
old
enough
to
be
lulu
mother
as
jacques
called
him
the
little
poet
it
at
most
and
nais
between
ourselves
is
quite
forty
for
my
own
part
said
du
chatelet
i
think
that
de
position
in
itself
proves
nais
innocence
a
man
does
not
go
down
on
his
knees
to
ask
for
what
he
has
had
already
that
is
as
may
be
said
francis
with
levity
that
brought
zephirine
disapproving
glance
down
on
him
do
just
tell
us
how
it
really
was
they
besought
stanislas
and
formed
a
small
secret
committee
in
a
corner
of
the
salon
stanislas
in
the
long
length
had
put
together
a
little
story
full
of
facetious
suggestions
and
accompanied
it
with
pantomime
which
made
the
thing
prodigiously
worse
it
is
incredible
at
midday
nais
was
the
last
person
whom
i
should
have
suspected
what
will
she
do
now
then
followed
more
comments
and
suppositions
without
end
chatelet
took
mme
de
bargeton
part
but
he
defended
her
so
ill
that
he
stirred
the
fire
of
gossip
instead
of
putting
it
out
lili
disconsolate
over
the
fall
of
the
fairest
angel
in
the
angoumoisin
hierarchy
went
dissolved
in
tears
to
carry
the
news
to
the
palace
when
the
delighted
chatelet
was
convinced
that
the
whole
town
was
agog
he
went
off
to
mme
de
bargeton
where
alas
there
was
but
one
game
of
whist
that
night
and
diplomatically
asked
nais
for
a
little
talk
in
the
boudoir
they
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
chatelet
began
in
an
undertone
you
know
what
angouleme
is
talking
about
of
course
no
very
well
i
am
too
much
your
friend
to
leave
you
in
ignorance
i
am
bound
to
put
you
in
a
position
to
silence
slanders
invented
no
doubt
by
amelie
who
has
the
overweening
audacity
to
regard
herself
as
your
rival
i
came
to
call
on
you
this
morning
with
that
monkey
of
a
stanislas
he
was
a
few
paces
ahead
of
me
and
he
came
so
far
pointing
to
the
door
of
the
boudoir
he
says
that
he
you
and
de
rubempre
in
such
a
position
that
he
could
not
enter
he
turned
round
upon
me
quite
bewildered
as
i
was
and
hurried
me
away
before
i
had
time
to
think
we
were
out
in
beaulieu
before
he
told
me
why
he
had
beaten
a
retreat
if
i
had
known
i
would
not
have
stirred
out
of
the
house
till
i
had
cleared
up
the
matter
and
exonerated
you
but
it
would
have
proved
nothing
to
go
back
again
then
now
whether
stanislas
eyes
deceived
him
or
whether
he
is
right
must
have
made
a
dear
nais
do
not
let
that
dolt
trifle
with
your
life
your
honor
your
future
stop
his
mouth
at
once
you
know
my
position
here
i
have
need
of
all
these
people
but
still
i
am
entirely
yours
dispose
of
a
life
that
belongs
to
you
you
have
rejected
my
prayers
but
my
heart
is
always
yours
i
am
ready
to
prove
my
love
for
you
at
any
time
and
in
any
way
yes
i
will
watch
over
you
like
a
faithful
servant
for
no
reward
but
simply
for
the
sake
of
the
pleasure
that
it
is
to
me
to
do
anything
for
you
even
if
you
do
not
know
of
it
this
morning
i
have
said
everywhere
that
i
was
at
the
door
of
the
salon
and
had
seen
nothing
if
you
are
asked
to
give
the
name
of
the
person
who
told
you
about
this
gossip
pray
make
use
of
me
i
should
be
very
proud
to
be
your
acknowledged
champion
but
between
ourselves
de
bargeton
is
the
proper
person
to
ask
stanislas
for
an
explanation
suppose
that
young
rubempre
had
behaved
foolishly
a
woman
character
ought
not
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
first
boy
who
flings
himself
at
her
feet
that
is
what
i
have
been
saying
nais
bowed
in
acknowledgment
and
looked
thoughtful
she
was
weary
to
disgust
of
provincial
life
chatelet
had
scarcely
begun
before
her
mind
turned
to
paris
meanwhile
mme
de
bargeton
adorer
found
the
silence
somewhat
awkward
dispose
of
me
i
repeat
he
added
thank
you
answered
the
lady
what
do
you
think
of
doing
i
shall
see
a
prolonged
pause
are
you
so
fond
of
that
young
rubempre
a
proud
smile
stole
over
her
lips
she
folded
her
arms
and
fixed
her
gaze
on
the
curtains
chatelet
went
out
he
could
not
read
that
high
heart
later
in
the
evening
when
lucien
had
taken
his
leave
and
likewise
the
four
old
gentlemen
who
came
for
their
whist
without
troubling
themselves
about
de
bargeton
was
preparing
to
go
to
bed
and
had
opened
his
mouth
to
bid
his
wife
when
she
stopped
him
come
here
dear
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
she
said
with
a
certain
solemnity
de
bargeton
followed
her
into
the
boudoir
perhaps
i
have
done
wrongly
she
said
to
show
a
warm
interest
in
de
rubempre
which
he
as
well
as
the
stupid
people
here
in
the
town
has
misinterpreted
this
morning
lucien
threw
himself
here
at
my
feet
with
a
declaration
and
stanislas
happened
to
come
in
just
as
i
told
the
boy
to
get
up
again
a
woman
under
any
circumstances
has
claims
which
courtesy
prescribes
to
a
gentleman
but
in
contempt
of
these
stanislas
has
been
saying
that
he
came
unexpectedly
and
found
us
in
an
equivocal
position
i
was
treating
the
boy
as
he
deserved
if
the
young
scatterbrain
knew
of
the
scandal
caused
by
his
folly
he
would
go
i
am
convinced
to
insult
stanislas
and
compel
him
to
fight
that
would
simply
be
a
public
proclamation
of
his
love
i
need
not
tell
you
that
your
wife
is
pure
but
if
you
think
you
will
see
that
it
is
something
dishonoring
for
both
you
and
me
if
de
rubempre
defends
her
go
at
once
to
stanislas
and
ask
him
to
give
you
satisfaction
for
his
insulting
language
and
mind
you
must
not
accept
any
explanation
short
of
a
full
and
public
retraction
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
of
credit
in
this
way
you
will
win
back
the
respect
of
all
people
you
will
behave
like
a
man
of
spirit
and
a
gentleman
and
you
will
have
a
right
to
my
esteem
i
shall
send
gentil
on
horseback
to
the
escarbas
my
father
must
be
your
second
old
as
he
is
i
know
that
he
is
the
man
to
trample
this
puppet
under
foot
that
has
smirched
the
reputation
of
a
negrepelisse
you
have
the
choice
of
weapons
choose
pistols
you
are
an
admirable
shot
i
am
going
said
de
bargeton
and
he
took
his
hat
and
his
walking
cane
good
that
is
how
i
like
a
man
to
behave
dear
you
are
a
gentleman
said
his
wife
she
felt
touched
by
his
conduct
and
made
the
old
man
very
happy
and
proud
by
putting
up
her
forehead
for
a
kiss
she
felt
something
like
a
maternal
affection
for
the
great
child
and
when
the
carriage
gateway
had
shut
with
a
clang
behind
him
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
in
spite
of
herself
how
he
loves
me
she
thought
he
clings
to
life
poor
dear
man
and
yet
he
would
give
his
life
for
me
it
did
not
trouble
de
bargeton
that
he
must
stand
up
and
face
his
man
on
the
morrow
and
look
coolly
into
the
muzzle
of
a
pistol
pointed
straight
at
him
no
only
one
thing
in
the
business
made
him
feel
uncomfortable
and
on
the
way
to
de
chandour
house
he
quaked
inwardly
what
shall
i
say
he
thought
within
himself
nais
really
ought
to
have
told
me
what
to
say
and
the
good
gentleman
racked
his
brains
to
compose
a
speech
that
should
not
be
ridiculous
but
people
of
de
bargeton
stamp
who
live
perforce
in
silence
because
their
capacity
is
limited
and
their
outlook
circumscribed
often
behave
at
great
crises
with
a
solemnity
if
they
say
little
it
naturally
follows
that
they
say
little
that
is
foolish
their
extreme
lack
of
confidence
leads
them
to
think
a
good
deal
over
the
remarks
that
they
are
obliged
to
make
and
like
balaam
ass
they
speak
marvelously
to
the
point
if
a
miracle
loosens
their
tongues
so
de
bargeton
bore
himself
like
a
man
of
uncommon
sense
and
spirit
and
justified
the
opinion
of
those
who
held
that
he
was
a
philosopher
of
the
school
of
pythagoras
he
reached
stanislas
house
at
nine
bowed
silently
to
amelie
before
a
whole
room
full
of
people
and
greeted
others
in
turn
with
that
simple
smile
of
his
which
under
the
present
circumstances
seemed
profoundly
ironical
there
followed
a
great
silence
like
the
pause
before
a
storm
chatelet
had
made
his
way
back
again
and
now
looked
in
a
very
significant
fashion
from
de
bargeton
to
stanislas
whom
the
injured
gentleman
accosted
politely
chatelet
knew
what
a
visit
meant
at
this
time
of
night
when
old
de
bargeton
was
invariably
in
his
bed
it
was
evidently
nais
who
had
set
the
feeble
arm
in
motion
chatelet
was
on
such
a
footing
in
that
house
that
he
had
some
right
to
interfere
in
family
concerns
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
took
de
bargeton
aside
saying
do
you
wish
to
speak
to
stanislas
yes
said
the
old
gentleman
well
pleased
to
find
a
who
perhaps
might
say
his
say
for
him
very
well
go
into
amelie
bedroom
said
the
controller
of
excise
likewise
well
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
a
duel
which
possibly
might
make
mme
de
bargeton
a
widow
while
it
put
a
bar
between
her
and
lucien
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
then
chatelet
went
to
de
chandour
stanislas
he
said
here
comes
bargeton
to
call
you
to
account
no
doubt
for
the
things
you
have
been
saying
about
nais
go
into
your
wife
room
and
behave
both
of
you
like
gentlemen
keep
the
thing
quiet
and
make
a
great
show
of
politeness
behave
with
phlegmatic
british
dignity
in
short
in
another
minute
stanislas
and
chatelet
went
to
bargeton
sir
said
the
injured
husband
do
you
say
that
you
discovered
mme
de
bargeton
and
de
rubempre
in
an
equivocal
position
chardon
corrected
stanislas
with
ironical
stress
he
did
not
take
bargeton
seriously
so
be
it
answered
the
other
if
you
do
not
withdraw
your
assertions
at
once
before
the
company
now
in
your
house
i
must
ask
you
to
look
for
a
second
my
de
negrepelisse
will
wait
upon
you
at
four
morning
both
of
us
may
as
well
make
our
final
arrangements
for
the
only
way
out
of
the
affair
is
the
one
that
i
have
indicated
i
choose
pistols
as
the
insulted
party
this
was
the
speech
that
de
bargeton
had
ruminated
on
the
way
it
was
the
longest
that
he
had
ever
made
in
life
he
brought
it
out
without
excitement
or
vehemence
in
the
simplest
way
in
the
world
stanislas
turned
pale
after
all
what
did
i
see
said
he
to
himself
put
between
the
shame
of
eating
his
words
before
the
whole
town
and
fear
that
caught
him
by
the
throat
with
burning
fingers
confronted
by
this
mute
personage
who
seemed
in
no
humor
to
stand
nonsense
stanislas
chose
the
more
remote
peril
all
right
morning
he
said
thinking
that
the
matter
might
be
arranged
somehow
or
other
the
three
went
back
to
the
room
everybody
scanned
their
faces
as
they
came
in
chatelet
was
smiling
de
bargeton
looked
exactly
as
if
he
were
in
his
own
house
but
stanislas
looked
ghastly
pale
at
the
sight
of
his
face
some
of
the
women
here
and
there
guessed
the
nature
of
the
conference
and
the
whisper
they
are
going
to
fight
circulated
from
ear
to
ear
of
the
room
was
of
the
opinion
that
stanislas
was
in
the
wrong
his
white
face
and
his
demeanor
convicted
him
of
a
lie
the
other
half
admired
de
bargeton
attitude
chatelet
was
solemn
and
mysterious
de
bargeton
stayed
a
few
minutes
scrutinized
people
faces
and
retired
have
you
pistols
chatelet
asked
in
a
whisper
of
stanislas
who
shook
from
head
to
foot
amelie
knew
what
it
all
meant
she
felt
ill
and
the
women
flocked
about
her
to
take
her
into
her
bedroom
there
was
a
terrific
sensation
everybody
talked
at
once
the
men
stopped
in
the
and
declared
with
one
voice
that
de
bargeton
was
within
his
right
would
you
have
thought
the
old
fogy
capable
of
acting
like
this
asked
de
saintot
but
he
was
a
crack
shot
when
he
was
young
said
the
pitiless
jacques
my
father
often
used
to
tell
me
of
bargeton
exploits
pooh
put
them
at
twenty
paces
and
they
will
miss
each
other
if
you
give
them
cavalry
pistols
said
francis
addressing
chatelet
chatelet
stayed
after
the
rest
had
gone
to
reassure
stanislas
and
his
wife
and
to
explain
that
all
would
go
off
well
in
a
duel
between
a
man
of
sixty
and
a
man
of
all
the
advantage
lay
with
the
latter
early
next
morning
as
lucien
sat
at
breakfast
with
david
who
had
come
back
alone
from
marsac
in
came
mme
chardon
with
a
scared
face
well
lucien
she
said
have
you
heard
the
news
everyone
is
talking
of
it
even
the
people
in
the
market
de
bargeton
all
but
killed
de
chandour
this
morning
in
tulloy
meadow
people
are
making
puns
on
the
name
tue
poie
it
seems
that
de
chandour
said
that
he
found
you
with
mme
de
bargeton
yesterday
it
is
a
lie
mme
de
bargeton
is
innocent
cried
lucien
i
heard
about
the
duel
from
a
countryman
who
saw
it
all
from
his
cart
de
negrepelisse
came
over
at
three
in
the
morning
to
be
de
bargeton
second
he
told
de
chandour
that
if
anything
happened
to
his
he
should
avenge
him
a
cavalry
officer
lent
the
pistols
de
negrepelisse
tried
them
over
and
over
again
du
chatelet
tried
to
prevent
them
from
practising
with
the
pistols
but
they
referred
the
question
to
the
officer
and
he
said
that
unless
they
meant
to
behave
like
children
they
ought
to
have
pistols
in
working
order
the
seconds
put
them
at
paces
de
bargeton
looked
as
if
he
had
just
come
out
for
a
walk
he
was
the
first
to
fire
the
ball
lodged
in
de
chandour
neck
and
he
dropped
before
he
could
return
the
shot
the
at
the
hospital
has
just
said
that
de
chandour
will
have
a
wry
neck
for
the
rest
of
his
days
i
came
to
tell
you
how
it
ended
lest
you
should
go
to
mme
de
bargeton
or
show
yourself
in
angouleme
for
some
of
de
chandour
friends
might
call
you
out
as
she
spoke
the
apprentice
brought
in
gentil
de
footman
the
man
had
come
with
a
note
for
lucien
it
was
from
louise
you
have
doubtless
heard
the
news
she
wrote
of
the
duel
between
chandour
and
my
husband
we
shall
not
be
at
home
to
any
one
be
careful
do
not
show
yourself
i
ask
this
in
the
name
of
the
affection
you
bear
me
do
you
not
think
that
it
would
be
best
to
spend
this
melancholy
day
in
listening
to
your
beatrice
whose
whole
life
has
been
changed
by
this
event
who
has
a
thousand
things
to
say
to
you
luckily
my
marriage
is
fixed
for
the
day
after
said
david
and
you
will
have
an
excuse
for
not
going
to
see
mme
de
bargeton
quite
so
often
dear
david
returned
lucien
she
asks
me
to
go
to
her
and
i
ought
to
do
as
she
wishes
i
think
she
knows
better
than
we
do
how
i
should
act
in
the
present
state
of
things
then
is
everything
ready
here
asked
mme
chardon
come
and
see
cried
david
delighted
to
exhibit
the
transformation
of
the
first
floor
everything
there
was
new
and
fresh
everything
was
pervaded
by
the
sweet
influences
of
early
married
days
still
crowned
by
the
wreath
of
orange
blossoms
and
the
bridal
veil
days
when
the
springtide
of
love
finds
its
reflection
in
material
things
and
everything
is
white
and
spotless
and
has
not
lost
its
bloom
eve
home
will
be
fit
for
a
princess
said
the
mother
but
you
have
spent
too
much
you
have
been
reckless
david
smiled
by
way
of
answer
but
mme
chardon
had
touched
the
sore
spot
in
a
hidden
wound
which
caused
the
poor
lover
cruel
pangs
the
cost
of
carrying
out
his
ideas
had
far
exceeded
his
estimates
he
could
not
afford
to
build
above
the
shed
his
must
wait
awhile
for
the
home
he
had
meant
to
make
for
her
there
is
nothing
more
keenly
painful
to
a
generous
nature
than
a
failure
to
keep
such
promises
as
these
it
is
like
mortification
to
the
little
vanities
of
affection
as
they
may
be
styled
david
sedulously
hid
his
embarrassment
to
spare
lucien
he
was
afraid
that
lucien
might
be
overwhelmed
by
the
sacrifices
made
for
his
sake
eve
and
her
girl
friends
have
been
working
very
hard
too
said
mme
chardon
the
wedding
clothes
and
the
house
linen
are
all
ready
the
girls
are
so
fond
of
her
that
without
letting
her
know
about
it
they
have
covered
the
mattresses
with
white
twill
and
a
piping
at
the
edges
so
pretty
it
makes
one
wish
one
were
going
to
be
married
mother
and
daughter
had
spent
all
their
little
savings
to
furnish
david
home
with
the
things
of
which
a
young
bachelor
never
thinks
they
knew
that
he
was
furnishing
with
great
splendor
for
something
had
been
said
about
ordering
a
from
limoges
and
the
two
women
had
striven
to
make
eve
contributions
to
the
housekeeping
worthy
of
david
this
little
emulation
in
love
and
generosity
could
but
bring
the
husband
and
wife
into
difficulties
at
the
very
outset
of
their
married
life
with
every
sign
of
homely
comfort
about
them
comfort
that
might
be
regarded
as
positive
luxury
in
a
place
so
behind
the
times
as
the
angouleme
of
those
days
as
soon
as
lucien
saw
his
mother
and
david
enter
the
bedroom
with
the
draperies
and
neat
furniture
that
he
knew
he
slipped
away
to
mme
de
bargeton
he
found
nais
at
table
with
her
husband
de
bargeton
early
morning
walk
had
sharpened
his
appetite
and
he
was
breakfasting
quite
unconcernedly
after
all
that
had
passed
lucien
saw
the
dignified
face
of
de
negrepelisse
the
old
provincial
noble
a
relic
of
the
old
french
sitting
beside
nais
when
gentil
announced
de
rubempre
the
old
man
gave
him
a
keen
curious
glance
the
father
was
anxious
to
form
his
own
opinions
of
this
man
whom
his
daughter
had
singled
out
for
notice
lucien
extreme
beauty
made
such
a
vivid
impression
upon
him
that
he
could
not
repress
an
approving
glance
but
at
the
same
time
he
seemed
to
regard
the
affair
as
a
flirtation
a
mere
passing
fancy
on
his
daughter
part
breakfast
over
louise
could
leave
her
father
and
de
bargeton
together
she
beckoned
lucien
to
follow
her
as
she
withdrew
dear
she
said
and
the
tones
of
her
voice
were
half
glad
half
melancholy
i
am
going
to
paris
and
my
father
is
taking
bargeton
back
with
him
to
the
escarbas
where
he
will
stay
during
my
absence
mme
she
was
a
before
her
marriage
has
great
influence
herself
and
influential
relations
the
are
connections
of
ours
they
are
the
older
branch
of
the
negrepelisses
and
if
she
vouchsafes
to
acknowledge
the
relationship
i
intend
to
cultivate
her
a
good
deal
she
may
perhaps
procure
a
place
for
bargeton
at
my
solicitation
it
might
be
desired
at
court
that
he
should
represent
the
charente
and
that
would
be
a
step
towards
his
election
here
if
he
were
a
deputy
it
would
further
other
steps
that
i
wish
to
take
in
paris
you
my
darling
have
brought
about
this
change
in
my
life
after
this
morning
duel
i
am
obliged
to
shut
up
my
house
for
some
time
for
there
will
be
people
who
will
side
with
the
chandours
against
us
in
our
position
and
in
a
small
town
absence
is
the
only
way
of
softening
down
bad
feeling
but
i
shall
either
succeed
and
never
see
angouleme
again
or
i
shall
not
succeed
and
then
i
mean
to
wait
in
paris
until
the
time
comes
when
i
can
spend
my
summers
at
the
escarbas
and
the
winters
in
paris
it
is
the
only
life
for
a
woman
of
quality
and
i
have
waited
too
long
before
entering
upon
it
the
one
day
will
be
enough
for
our
preparations
night
i
shall
set
out
and
you
are
coming
with
me
are
you
not
you
shall
start
first
i
will
overtake
you
between
mansle
and
ruffec
and
we
shall
soon
be
in
paris
there
beloved
is
the
life
for
a
man
who
has
anything
in
him
we
are
only
at
our
ease
among
our
equals
we
are
uncomfortable
in
any
other
society
paris
besides
is
the
capital
of
the
intellectual
world
the
stage
on
which
you
will
succeed
overleap
the
gulf
that
separates
us
quickly
you
must
not
allow
your
ideas
to
grow
rancid
in
the
provinces
put
yourself
into
communication
at
once
with
the
great
men
who
represent
the
nineteenth
century
try
to
stand
well
with
the
court
and
with
those
in
power
no
honor
no
distinction
comes
to
seek
out
the
talent
that
perishes
for
lack
of
light
in
a
little
town
tell
me
if
you
can
the
name
of
any
great
work
of
art
executed
in
the
provinces
on
the
contrary
see
how
himself
sublime
in
his
poverty
felt
the
irresistible
attraction
of
that
sun
of
the
intellectual
world
which
produces
glories
and
stimulates
the
intellect
paris
where
men
rub
against
one
another
what
is
it
but
your
duty
to
hasten
to
take
your
place
in
the
succession
of
pleiades
that
rise
from
generation
to
generation
you
have
no
idea
how
it
contributes
to
the
success
of
a
clever
young
man
to
be
brought
into
a
high
light
socially
speaking
i
will
introduce
you
to
mme
it
is
not
easy
to
get
into
her
set
but
you
meet
all
the
greatest
people
at
her
house
cabinet
ministers
and
ambassadors
and
great
orators
from
the
chamber
of
deputies
and
peers
and
men
of
influence
and
wealthy
or
famous
people
a
young
man
with
good
looks
and
more
than
sufficient
genius
could
fail
to
excite
interest
only
by
very
bad
management
there
is
no
pettiness
about
those
who
are
truly
great
they
will
lend
you
their
support
and
when
you
yourself
have
a
high
position
your
work
will
rise
immensely
in
public
opinion
the
great
problem
for
the
artist
is
the
problem
of
putting
himself
in
evidence
in
these
ways
there
will
be
hundreds
of
chances
of
making
your
way
of
sinecures
of
a
pension
from
the
civil
list
the
bourbons
are
so
fond
of
encouraging
letters
and
the
arts
and
you
therefore
must
be
a
religious
poet
and
a
royalist
poet
at
the
same
time
not
only
is
it
the
right
course
but
it
is
the
way
to
get
on
in
life
do
the
liberals
and
the
opposition
give
places
and
rewards
and
make
the
fortunes
of
men
of
letters
take
the
right
road
and
reach
the
goal
of
genius
you
have
my
secret
do
not
breathe
a
syllable
of
it
and
prepare
to
follow
would
you
rather
not
go
she
added
surprised
that
her
lover
made
no
answer
to
lucien
listening
to
the
alluring
words
and
bewildered
by
the
rapid
view
of
paris
which
they
brought
before
him
it
seemed
as
if
hitherto
he
had
been
using
only
half
his
brain
and
suddenly
had
found
the
other
half
so
swiftly
his
ideas
widened
he
saw
himself
stagnating
in
angouleme
like
a
frog
under
a
stone
in
a
marsh
paris
and
her
splendors
rose
before
him
paris
the
eldorado
of
provincial
imaginings
with
golden
robes
and
the
royal
diadem
about
her
brows
and
arms
outstretched
to
talent
of
every
kind
great
men
would
greet
him
there
as
one
of
their
order
everything
smiled
upon
genius
there
there
were
no
jealous
to
invent
stinging
gibes
and
humiliate
a
man
of
letters
there
was
no
stupid
indifference
to
poetry
in
paris
paris
was
the
of
poetry
there
the
poet
was
brought
into
the
light
and
paid
for
his
work
publishers
should
no
sooner
read
the
opening
pages
of
archer
of
charles
than
they
should
open
their
with
how
much
do
you
want
and
besides
all
this
he
understood
that
this
journey
with
mme
de
bargeton
would
virtually
give
her
to
him
that
they
should
live
together
so
at
the
words
would
you
rather
not
go
tears
came
into
his
eyes
he
flung
his
arms
about
louise
held
her
tightly
to
his
heart
and
marbled
her
throat
with
impassioned
kisses
suddenly
he
checked
himself
as
if
memory
had
dealt
him
a
blow
great
heavens
he
cried
my
sister
is
to
be
married
on
the
day
after
that
exclamation
was
the
last
expiring
cry
of
noble
and
boyhood
the
ties
that
bind
young
hearts
to
home
and
a
first
friendship
and
all
early
affections
were
to
be
severed
at
one
ruthless
blow
well
cried
the
haughty
negrepelisse
and
what
has
your
marriage
to
do
with
the
progress
of
our
love
have
you
set
your
mind
so
much
on
being
best
man
at
a
wedding
party
of
tradespeople
and
workingmen
that
you
can
not
give
up
these
exalted
joys
for
my
sake
a
great
sacrifice
indeed
she
went
on
scornfully
this
morning
i
sent
my
husband
out
to
fight
in
your
quarrel
there
sir
go
i
am
mistaken
in
you
she
sank
fainting
upon
the
sofa
lucien
went
to
her
entreating
her
pardon
calling
execrations
upon
his
family
his
sister
and
david
i
had
such
faith
in
you
she
said
de
had
an
adored
mother
but
to
win
a
letter
from
me
and
the
words
am
satisfied
he
fell
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
and
now
when
i
ask
you
to
take
a
journey
with
me
you
can
not
think
of
giving
up
a
wedding
dinner
for
my
sake
lucien
was
ready
to
kill
himself
his
desperation
was
so
unfeigned
that
louise
forgave
him
though
at
the
same
time
she
made
him
feel
that
he
must
redeem
his
mistake
come
come
she
said
be
discreet
and
at
midnight
be
upon
the
road
a
hundred
paces
out
of
mansle
lucien
felt
the
globe
shrink
under
his
feet
he
went
back
to
house
hopes
pursuing
him
as
the
furies
followed
orestes
for
he
had
glimmerings
of
endless
difficulties
all
summed
up
in
the
appalling
words
where
is
the
money
to
come
from
he
stood
in
such
terror
of
david
perspicacity
that
he
locked
himself
into
his
pretty
new
study
until
he
could
recover
himself
his
head
was
swimming
in
this
new
position
so
he
must
leave
the
rooms
just
furnished
for
him
at
such
a
cost
and
all
the
sacrifices
that
had
been
made
for
him
had
been
made
in
vain
then
it
occurred
to
lucien
that
his
mother
might
take
the
rooms
and
save
david
the
heavy
expense
of
building
at
the
end
of
the
yard
as
he
had
meant
to
do
his
departure
would
be
in
fact
a
convenience
to
the
family
he
discovered
any
quantity
of
urgent
reasons
for
his
sudden
flight
for
there
is
no
such
jesuit
as
the
desire
of
your
heart
he
hurried
down
at
once
to
tell
the
news
to
his
sister
in
and
to
take
counsel
with
her
as
he
reached
postel
shop
he
bethought
himself
that
if
all
other
means
failed
he
could
borrow
enough
to
live
upon
for
a
year
from
his
father
successor
three
francs
per
day
will
be
abundance
for
me
if
i
live
with
louise
he
thought
it
is
only
a
thousand
francs
for
a
whole
year
and
in
six
months
time
i
shall
have
plenty
of
money
then
under
seal
and
promise
of
secrecy
eve
and
her
mother
heard
lucien
confidences
both
the
women
began
to
cry
as
they
heard
of
the
ambitious
plans
and
when
he
asked
the
reason
of
their
trouble
they
told
him
that
every
penny
they
possessed
had
been
spent
on
eve
wedding
clothes
and
on
a
host
of
things
that
david
had
overlooked
they
had
been
so
glad
to
do
this
for
david
had
made
a
of
ten
thousand
francs
on
eve
lucien
then
spoke
of
his
idea
of
a
loan
and
mme
chardon
undertook
to
ask
postel
to
lend
them
a
thousand
francs
for
a
but
lucien
said
eve
as
a
thought
clutched
at
her
heart
you
will
not
be
here
at
my
wedding
oh
come
back
i
will
put
it
off
for
a
few
days
surely
she
will
give
you
leave
to
come
back
in
a
fortnight
if
only
you
go
with
her
now
surely
she
would
spare
you
to
us
for
a
week
lucien
when
we
brought
you
up
for
her
we
shall
have
no
luck
if
you
are
not
at
the
wedding
but
will
a
thousand
francs
be
enough
for
you
she
asked
suddenly
interrupting
herself
your
coat
suits
you
divinely
but
you
have
only
that
one
you
have
only
two
fine
shirts
the
other
six
are
coarse
linen
and
three
of
your
white
ties
are
just
common
muslin
there
are
only
two
lawn
cravats
and
your
are
not
good
ones
where
will
you
find
a
sister
in
paris
who
will
get
up
your
linen
in
one
day
as
you
want
it
you
will
want
ever
so
much
more
then
you
have
just
the
one
pair
of
new
nankeen
trousers
last
year
trousers
are
tight
for
you
you
will
be
obliged
to
have
clothes
made
in
paris
and
paris
prices
are
not
like
angouleme
prices
you
have
only
two
presentable
white
waistcoats
i
have
mended
the
others
already
come
i
advise
you
to
take
two
thousand
francs
david
came
in
as
she
spoke
and
apparently
heard
the
last
two
words
for
he
looked
at
the
brother
and
sister
and
said
nothing
do
not
keep
anything
from
me
he
said
at
last
well
exclaimed
eve
he
is
going
away
with
mme
chardon
came
in
again
and
not
seeing
david
began
at
once
postel
is
willing
to
lend
you
the
thousand
francs
lucien
she
said
but
only
for
six
months
and
even
then
he
wants
you
to
let
him
have
a
bill
endorsed
by
your
for
he
says
that
you
are
giving
him
no
security
she
turned
and
saw
david
and
there
was
a
deep
silence
in
the
room
the
chardons
thought
how
they
had
abused
david
goodness
and
felt
ashamed
tears
stood
in
the
young
printer
eyes
then
you
will
not
be
here
at
our
wedding
he
began
you
are
not
going
to
live
with
us
and
here
have
i
been
squandering
all
that
i
had
oh
lucien
as
i
came
along
bringing
eve
her
little
bits
of
wedding
jewelry
i
did
not
think
that
i
should
be
sorry
i
spent
the
money
on
them
he
brushed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
as
he
drew
the
little
cases
from
his
pocket
he
set
down
the
tiny
boxes
on
the
table
in
front
of
his
oh
why
do
you
think
so
much
for
me
protested
eve
giving
him
a
divinely
sweet
smile
that
belied
her
words
mamma
dear
said
david
just
tell
postel
that
i
will
put
my
name
to
the
bill
for
i
can
tell
from
your
face
lucien
that
you
have
quite
made
up
your
mind
to
go
lucien
head
sank
dejectedly
there
was
a
little
pause
then
he
said
do
not
think
hardly
of
me
my
dear
good
angels
he
put
his
arms
about
eve
and
david
and
drew
them
close
and
held
them
tightly
to
him
as
he
added
wait
and
see
what
comes
of
it
and
you
shall
know
how
much
i
love
you
what
is
the
good
of
our
high
thinking
david
if
it
does
not
enable
us
to
disregard
the
petty
ceremonial
in
which
the
law
entangles
our
affections
shall
i
not
be
with
you
in
spirit
in
spite
of
the
distance
between
us
shall
we
not
be
united
in
thought
have
i
not
a
destiny
to
fulfil
will
publishers
come
here
to
seek
my
of
charles
and
the
a
little
sooner
or
a
little
later
i
shall
be
obliged
in
any
case
to
do
as
i
am
doing
should
i
not
and
shall
i
ever
find
a
better
opportunity
than
this
does
not
my
success
entirely
depend
upon
my
entrance
on
life
in
paris
through
the
marquise
salon
he
is
right
said
eve
you
yourself
were
saying
were
you
not
that
he
ought
to
go
to
paris
at
once
david
took
eve
hand
in
his
and
drew
her
into
the
narrow
little
room
where
she
had
slept
for
seven
years
love
you
were
saying
just
now
that
he
would
want
two
thousand
francs
he
said
in
her
ear
postel
is
only
lending
one
thousand
eve
gave
her
betrothed
a
look
and
he
read
all
her
anguish
in
her
eyes
listen
my
adored
eve
we
are
making
a
bad
start
in
life
yes
my
expenses
have
taken
all
my
capital
i
have
just
two
thousand
francs
left
and
half
of
it
will
be
wanted
to
carry
on
the
business
if
we
give
your
brother
the
thousand
francs
it
will
mean
that
we
are
giving
away
our
bread
that
we
shall
live
in
anxiety
if
i
were
alone
i
know
what
i
should
do
but
we
are
two
decide
for
us
eve
distracted
sprang
to
her
lover
arms
and
kissed
him
tenderly
as
she
answered
through
her
tears
do
as
you
would
do
if
you
were
alone
i
will
work
to
earn
the
money
in
spite
of
the
most
impassioned
kiss
ever
given
and
taken
by
betrothed
lovers
david
left
eve
overcome
with
trouble
and
went
out
to
lucien
do
not
worry
yourself
he
said
you
shall
have
your
two
thousand
francs
go
in
to
see
postel
said
mme
chardon
for
you
must
both
give
your
signatures
to
the
bill
when
lucien
and
david
came
back
again
unexpectedly
they
found
eve
and
her
mother
on
their
knees
in
prayer
the
women
felt
sure
that
return
would
bring
the
realization
of
many
hopes
but
at
the
moment
they
could
only
feel
how
much
they
were
losing
in
the
parting
and
the
happiness
to
come
seemed
too
dearly
bought
by
an
absence
that
broke
up
their
life
together
and
would
fill
the
coming
days
with
innumerable
fears
for
lucien
if
you
could
ever
forget
this
sight
david
said
in
lucien
ear
you
would
be
the
basest
of
men
david
no
doubt
thought
that
these
brave
words
were
needed
mme
de
bargeton
influence
seemed
to
him
less
to
be
feared
than
his
unlucky
instability
of
character
lucien
was
so
easily
led
for
good
or
evil
eve
soon
packed
lucien
clothes
the
fernando
cortez
of
literature
carried
but
little
baggage
he
was
wearing
his
best
overcoat
his
best
waistcoat
and
one
of
the
two
fine
shirts
the
whole
of
his
linen
the
celebrated
coat
and
his
manuscript
made
up
so
small
a
package
that
to
hide
it
from
mme
de
bargeton
david
proposed
to
send
it
by
coach
to
a
paper
merchant
with
whom
he
had
dealings
and
wrote
and
advised
him
to
that
effect
and
asked
him
to
keep
the
parcel
until
lucien
sent
for
it
in
spite
of
mme
de
bargeton
precautions
chatelet
found
out
that
she
was
leaving
angouleme
and
with
a
view
to
discovering
whether
she
was
traveling
alone
or
with
lucien
he
sent
his
man
to
ruffec
with
instructions
to
watch
every
carriage
that
changed
horses
at
that
stage
if
she
is
taking
her
poet
with
her
thought
he
i
have
her
now
lucien
set
out
before
daybreak
the
next
morning
david
went
with
him
david
had
hired
a
cabriolet
pretending
that
he
was
going
to
marsac
on
business
a
little
piece
of
deception
which
seemed
probable
under
the
circumstances
the
two
friends
went
to
marsac
and
spent
part
of
the
day
with
the
old
bear
as
evening
came
on
they
set
out
again
and
in
the
beginning
of
the
dawn
they
waited
in
the
road
on
the
further
side
of
mansle
for
mme
de
bargeton
when
the
old
traveling
carriage
which
he
had
many
a
time
seen
in
the
appeared
in
sight
lucien
felt
more
deeply
moved
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
before
he
sprang
into
david
arms
god
grant
that
this
may
be
for
your
good
said
david
and
he
climbed
into
the
shabby
cabriolet
and
drove
away
with
a
feeling
of
dread
clutching
at
his
heart
he
had
terrible
presentiments
of
the
fate
awaiting
lucien
in
paris

de

and

de

had
left
angouleme
behind
and
were
traveling
together
upon
the
road
to
paris
not
one
of
the
party
who
made
that
journey
alluded
to
it
afterwards
but
it
may
be
believed
that
an
infatuated
youth
who
had
looked
forward
to
the
delights
of
an
elopement
must
have
found
the
continual
presence
of
gentil
the
and
albertine
the
maid
not
a
little
irksome
on
the
way
lucien
traveling
post
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
was
horrified
to
see
pretty
nearly
the
whole
sum
on
which
he
meant
to
live
in
paris
for
a
twelvemonth
dropped
along
the
road
like
other
men
who
combine
great
intellectual
powers
with
the
charming
simplicity
of
childhood
he
openly
expressed
his
surprise
at
the
new
and
wonderful
things
which
he
saw
and
thereby
made
a
mistake
a
man
should
study
a
woman
very
carefully
before
he
allows
her
to
see
his
thoughts
and
emotions
as
they
arise
in
him
a
woman
whose
nature
is
large
as
her
heart
is
tender
can
smile
upon
childishness
and
make
allowances
but
let
her
have
ever
so
small
a
spice
of
vanity
herself
and
she
can
not
forgive
childishness
or
littleness
or
vanity
in
her
lover
many
a
woman
is
so
extravagant
a
worshiper
that
she
must
always
see
the
god
in
her
idol
but
there
are
yet
others
who
love
a
man
for
his
sake
and
not
for
their
own
and
adore
his
failings
with
his
greater
qualities
lucien
had
not
guessed
as
yet
that
mme
de
bargeton
love
was
grafted
on
pride
he
made
another
mistake
when
he
failed
to
discern
the
meaning
of
certain
smiles
which
flitted
over
louise
lips
from
time
to
time
and
instead
of
keeping
himself
to
himself
he
indulged
in
the
playfulness
of
the
young
rat
emerging
from
his
hole
for
the
first
time
the
travelers
were
set
down
before
daybreak
at
the
sign
of
the
in
the
rue
de
both
so
tired
out
with
the
journey
that
louise
went
straight
to
bed
and
slept
first
bidding
lucien
to
engage
the
room
immediately
overhead
lucien
slept
on
till
four
in
the
afternoon
when
he
was
awakened
by
mme
de
bargeton
servant
and
learning
the
hour
made
a
hasty
toilet
and
hurried
downstairs
louise
was
sitting
in
the
shabby
inn
hotel
accommodation
is
a
blot
on
the
civilization
of
paris
for
with
all
its
pretensions
to
elegance
the
city
as
yet
does
not
boast
a
single
inn
where
a
traveler
can
find
the
surroundings
to
which
he
is
accustomed
at
home
to
lucien
eyes
louise
was
hardly
recognizable
in
this
cheerless
sunless
room
with
the
shabby
the
comfortless
polished
floor
the
hideous
furniture
bought
or
much
the
worse
for
wear
some
people
no
longer
look
the
same
when
detached
from
the
background
of
faces
objects
and
surroundings
which
serve
as
a
setting
without
which
indeed
they
seem
to
lose
something
of
their
intrinsic
worth
personality
demands
its
appropriate
atmosphere
to
bring
out
its
values
just
as
the
figures
in
flemish
interiors
need
the
arrangement
of
light
and
shade
in
which
they
are
placed
by
the
painter
genius
if
they
are
to
live
for
us
this
is
especially
true
of
provincials
mme
de
bargeton
moreover
looked
more
thoughtful
and
dignified
than
was
necessary
now
when
no
barriers
stood
between
her
and
happiness
gentil
and
albertine
waited
upon
them
and
while
they
were
present
lucien
could
not
complain
the
dinner
sent
in
from
a
neighboring
restaurant
fell
far
below
the
provincial
average
both
in
quantity
and
quality
the
essential
goodness
of
country
fare
was
wanting
and
in
point
of
quantity
the
portions
were
cut
with
so
strict
an
eye
to
business
that
they
savored
of
short
commons
in
such
small
matters
paris
does
not
show
its
best
side
to
travelers
of
moderate
fortune
lucien
waited
till
the
meal
was
over
some
change
had
come
over
louise
he
thought
but
he
could
not
explain
it
and
a
change
had
in
fact
taken
place
events
had
occurred
while
he
slept
for
reflection
is
an
event
in
our
inner
history
and
mme
de
bargeton
had
been
reflecting
about
two
that
afternoon
sixte
du
chatelet
made
his
appearance
in
the
rue
de
and
asked
for
albertine
the
sleeping
damsel
was
roused
and
to
her
he
expressed
his
wish
to
speak
with
her
mistress
mme
de
bargeton
had
scarcely
time
to
dress
before
he
came
back
again
the
unaccountable
apparition
of
du
chatelet
roused
the
lady
curiosity
for
she
had
kept
her
journey
a
profound
secret
as
she
thought
at
three
the
visitor
was
admitted
i
have
risked
a
reprimand
from
headquarters
to
follow
you
he
said
as
he
greeted
her
i
foresaw
coming
events
but
if
i
lose
my
post
for
it
you
at
any
rate
shall
not
be
lost
what
do
you
mean
exclaimed
mme
de
bargeton
i
can
see
plainly
that
you
love
lucien
he
continued
with
an
air
of
tender
resignation
you
must
love
indeed
if
can
act
thus
recklessly
and
disregard
the
conventions
which
you
know
so
well
dear
adored
nais
can
you
really
imagine
that
mme
salon
or
any
other
salon
in
paris
will
not
be
closed
to
you
as
soon
as
it
is
known
that
you
have
fled
from
angouleme
as
it
were
with
a
young
man
especially
after
the
duel
between
de
bargeton
and
de
chandour
the
fact
that
your
husband
has
gone
to
the
escarbas
looks
like
a
separation
under
such
circumstances
a
gentleman
fights
first
and
afterwards
leaves
his
wife
at
liberty
by
all
means
give
de
rubempre
your
love
and
your
countenance
do
just
as
you
please
but
you
must
not
live
in
the
same
house
if
anybody
here
in
paris
knew
that
you
had
traveled
together
the
whole
world
that
you
have
a
mind
to
see
would
point
the
finger
at
you
and
nais
do
not
make
these
sacrifices
for
a
young
man
whom
you
have
as
yet
compared
with
no
one
else
he
on
his
side
has
been
put
to
no
proof
he
may
forsake
you
for
some
parisienne
better
able
as
he
may
fancy
to
further
his
ambitions
i
mean
no
harm
to
the
man
you
love
but
you
will
permit
me
to
put
your
own
interests
before
his
and
to
beg
you
to
study
him
to
be
fully
aware
of
the
serious
nature
of
this
step
that
you
are
taking
and
then
if
you
find
all
doors
closed
against
you
and
that
none
of
the
women
call
upon
you
make
sure
at
least
that
you
will
feel
no
regret
for
all
that
you
have
renounced
for
him
be
very
certain
first
that
he
for
whom
you
will
have
given
up
so
much
will
always
be
worthy
of
your
sacrifices
and
appreciate
them
just
now
continued
chatelet
mme
is
the
more
prudish
and
particular
because
she
herself
is
separated
from
her
husband
nobody
knows
why
the
navarreins
the
lenoncourts
the
and
the
rest
of
the
relations
have
all
rallied
round
her
the
most
women
are
seen
at
her
house
and
receive
her
with
respect
and
the
marquis
has
been
put
in
the
wrong
the
first
call
that
you
pay
will
make
it
clear
to
you
that
i
am
right
indeed
knowing
paris
as
i
do
i
can
tell
you
beforehand
that
you
will
no
sooner
enter
the
marquise
salon
than
you
will
be
in
despair
lest
she
should
find
out
that
you
are
staying
at
the
with
an
son
though
he
may
wish
to
be
called
de
rubempre
you
will
have
rivals
here
women
far
more
astute
and
shrewd
than
amelie
they
will
not
fail
to
discover
who
you
are
where
you
are
where
you
come
from
and
all
that
you
are
doing
you
have
counted
upon
your
incognito
i
see
but
you
are
one
of
those
women
for
whom
an
incognito
is
out
of
the
question
you
will
meet
angouleme
at
every
turn
there
are
the
deputies
from
the
charente
coming
up
for
the
opening
of
the
session
there
is
the
commandant
in
paris
on
leave
why
the
first
man
or
woman
from
angouleme
who
happens
to
see
you
would
cut
your
career
short
in
a
strange
fashion
you
would
simply
be
lucien
mistress
if
you
need
me
at
any
time
i
am
staying
with
the
in
the
rue
du
faubourg
two
steps
away
from
mme
i
am
sufficiently
acquainted
with
the
marechale
de
carigliano
mme
de
serizy
and
the
president
of
the
council
to
introduce
you
to
those
houses
but
you
will
meet
so
many
people
at
mme
that
you
are
not
likely
to
require
me
so
far
from
wishing
to
gain
admittance
to
this
set
or
that
every
one
will
be
longing
to
make
your
acquaintance
chatelet
talked
on
mme
de
bargeton
made
no
interruption
she
was
struck
with
his
perspicacity
the
queen
of
angouleme
had
in
fact
counted
upon
preserving
her
incognito
you
are
right
my
dear
friend
she
said
at
length
but
what
am
i
to
do
allow
me
to
find
suitable
furnished
lodgings
for
you
suggested
chatelet
that
way
of
living
is
less
expensive
than
an
inn
you
will
have
a
home
of
your
own
and
if
you
will
take
my
advice
you
will
sleep
in
your
new
rooms
this
very
night
but
how
did
you
know
my
address
queried
she
your
traveling
carriage
is
easily
recognized
and
besides
i
was
following
you
at
sevres
your
postilion
told
mine
that
he
had
brought
you
here
will
you
permit
me
to
act
as
your
harbinger
i
will
write
as
soon
as
i
have
found
lodgings
very
well
do
so
said
she
and
in
those
seemingly
insignificant
words
all
was
said
the
baron
du
chatelet
had
spoken
the
language
of
worldly
wisdom
to
a
woman
of
the
world
he
had
made
his
appearance
before
her
in
faultless
dress
a
neat
cab
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
door
and
mme
de
bargeton
standing
by
the
window
thinking
over
the
position
chanced
to
see
the
elderly
dandy
drive
away
a
few
moments
later
lucien
appeared
half
awake
and
hastily
dressed
he
was
handsome
it
is
true
but
his
clothes
his
last
year
nankeen
trousers
and
his
shabby
tight
jacket
were
ridiculous
put
antinous
or
the
apollo
belvedere
himself
into
a
blouse
and
how
shall
you
recognize
the
godlike
creature
of
the
greek
or
roman
chisel
the
eyes
note
and
compare
before
the
heart
has
time
to
revise
the
swift
involuntary
judgment
and
the
contrast
between
lucien
and
chatelet
was
so
abrupt
that
it
could
not
fail
to
strike
louise
towards
six
that
evening
when
dinner
was
over
mme
de
bargeton
beckoned
lucien
to
sit
beside
her
on
the
shabby
sofa
covered
with
a
flowered
chintz
a
yellow
pattern
on
a
red
ground
lucien
mine
she
said
do
you
think
that
if
we
have
both
of
us
done
a
foolish
thing
suicidal
for
both
our
interests
it
would
only
be
common
sense
to
set
matters
right
we
ought
not
to
live
together
in
paris
dear
boy
and
we
must
not
allow
anyone
to
suspect
that
we
traveled
together
your
career
depends
so
much
upon
my
position
that
i
ought
to
do
nothing
to
spoil
it
so
i
am
going
to
remove
into
lodgings
near
by
but
you
will
stay
on
here
we
can
see
each
other
every
day
and
nobody
can
say
a
word
against
us
and
louise
explained
conventions
to
lucien
who
opened
wide
eyes
he
had
still
to
learn
that
when
a
woman
thinks
better
of
her
folly
she
thinks
better
of
her
love
but
one
thing
he
understood
he
saw
that
he
was
no
longer
the
lucien
of
angouleme
louise
talked
of
herself
of
interests
reputation
and
of
the
world
and
to
veil
her
egoism
she
tried
to
make
him
believe
that
this
was
all
on
his
account
he
had
no
claim
upon
louise
thus
suddenly
transformed
into
mme
de
bargeton
and
more
serious
still
he
had
no
power
over
her
he
could
not
keep
back
the
tears
that
filled
his
eyes
if
i
am
your
glory
cried
the
poet
you
are
yet
more
to
me
you
are
my
one
hope
my
whole
future
rests
with
you
i
thought
that
if
you
meant
to
make
my
successes
yours
you
would
surely
make
my
adversity
yours
also
and
here
we
are
going
to
part
already
you
are
judging
my
conduct
said
she
you
do
not
love
me
lucien
looked
at
her
with
such
a
dolorous
expression
that
in
spite
of
herself
she
said
darling
i
will
stay
if
you
like
we
shall
both
be
ruined
we
shall
have
no
one
to
come
to
our
aid
but
when
we
are
both
equally
wretched
and
every
one
shuts
their
door
upon
us
both
when
failure
for
we
must
look
all
possibilities
in
the
face
when
failure
drives
us
back
to
the
escarbas
then
remember
love
that
i
foresaw
the
end
and
that
at
the
first
i
proposed
that
we
should
make
your
way
by
conforming
to
established
rules
louise
he
cried
with
his
arms
around
her
you
are
wise
you
frighten
me
remember
that
i
am
a
child
that
i
have
given
myself
up
entirely
to
your
dear
will
i
myself
should
have
preferred
to
overcome
obstacles
and
win
my
way
among
men
by
the
power
that
is
in
me
but
if
i
can
reach
the
goal
sooner
through
your
aid
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
owe
all
my
success
to
you
forgive
me
you
mean
so
much
to
me
that
i
can
not
help
fearing
all
kinds
of
things
and
for
me
parting
means
that
desertion
is
at
hand
and
desertion
is
death
but
my
dear
boy
the
world
demands
are
soon
satisfied
returned
she
you
must
sleep
here
that
is
all
all
day
long
you
will
be
with
me
and
no
one
can
say
a
word
a
few
kisses
set
lucien
mind
completely
at
rest
an
hour
later
gentil
brought
in
a
note
from
chatelet
he
told
mme
de
bargeton
that
he
had
found
lodgings
for
her
in
the
rue
mme
de
bargeton
informed
herself
of
the
exact
place
and
found
that
it
was
not
very
far
from
the
rue
de
we
shall
be
neighbors
she
told
lucien
two
hours
afterwards
louise
stepped
into
the
hired
carriage
sent
by
chatelet
for
the
removal
to
the
new
rooms
the
apartments
were
of
the
class
that
upholsterers
furnish
and
let
to
wealthy
deputies
and
persons
of
consideration
on
a
short
visit
to
paris
showy
and
uncomfortable
it
was
eleven
when
lucien
returned
to
his
inn
having
seen
nothing
as
yet
of
paris
except
the
part
of
the
rue
which
lies
between
the
rue
and
the
rue
de
he
lay
down
in
his
miserable
little
room
and
could
not
help
comparing
it
in
his
own
mind
with
louise
sumptuous
apartments
just
as
he
came
away
the
baron
du
chatelet
came
in
gorgeously
arrayed
in
evening
dress
fresh
from
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
to
inquire
whether
mme
de
bargeton
was
satisfied
with
all
that
he
had
done
on
her
behalf
nais
was
uneasy
the
splendor
was
alarming
to
her
mind
provincial
life
had
reacted
upon
her
she
was
painfully
conscientious
over
her
accounts
and
economical
to
a
degree
that
is
looked
upon
as
miserly
in
paris
she
had
brought
with
her
twenty
thousand
francs
in
the
shape
of
a
draft
on
the
considering
that
the
sum
would
more
than
cover
the
expenses
of
four
years
in
paris
she
was
afraid
already
lest
she
should
not
have
enough
and
should
run
into
debt
and
now
chatelet
told
her
that
her
rooms
would
only
cost
six
hundred
francs
per
month
a
mere
trifle
added
he
seeing
that
nais
was
startled
for
five
hundred
francs
a
month
you
can
have
a
carriage
from
a
livery
stable
fifty
louis
in
all
you
need
only
think
of
your
dress
a
woman
moving
in
good
society
could
not
well
do
less
and
if
you
mean
to
obtain
a
appointment
for
de
bargeton
or
a
post
in
the
household
you
ought
not
to
look
here
in
paris
they
only
give
to
the
rich
it
is
most
fortunate
that
you
brought
gentil
to
go
out
with
you
and
albertine
for
your
own
woman
for
servants
are
enough
to
ruin
you
here
but
with
your
introductions
you
will
seldom
be
home
to
a
meal
mme
de
bargeton
and
the
baron
de
chatelet
chatted
about
paris
chatelet
gave
her
all
the
news
of
the
day
the
myriad
nothings
that
you
are
bound
to
know
under
penalty
of
being
a
nobody
before
very
long
the
baron
also
gave
advice
as
to
shopping
recommending
herbault
for
toques
and
juliette
for
hats
and
bonnets
he
added
the
address
of
a
fashionable
dressmaker
to
supersede
victorine
in
short
he
made
the
lady
see
the
necessity
of
rubbing
off
angouleme
then
he
took
his
leave
after
a
final
flash
of
happy
inspiration
i
expect
i
shall
have
a
box
at
one
of
the
theatres
he
remarked
carelessly
i
will
call
for
you
and
de
rubempre
for
you
must
allow
me
to
do
the
honors
of
paris
there
is
more
generosity
in
his
character
than
i
thought
said
mme
de
bargeton
to
herself
when
lucien
was
included
in
the
invitation
in
the
month
of
june
ministers
are
often
puzzled
to
know
what
to
do
with
boxes
at
the
theatre
ministerialist
deputies
and
their
constituents
are
busy
in
their
vineyards
or
harvest
fields
and
their
more
exacting
acquaintances
are
in
the
country
or
traveling
about
so
it
comes
to
pass
that
the
best
seats
are
filled
at
this
season
with
heterogeneous
never
seen
at
any
other
time
of
year
and
the
house
is
apt
to
look
as
if
it
were
tapestried
with
very
shabby
material
chatelet
had
thought
already
that
this
was
his
opportunity
of
giving
nais
the
amusements
which
provincials
crave
most
eagerly
and
that
with
very
little
expense
the
next
morning
the
very
first
morning
in
paris
lucien
went
to
the
rue
and
found
that
louise
had
gone
out
she
had
gone
to
make
some
indispensable
purchases
to
take
counsel
of
the
mighty
and
illustrious
authorities
in
the
matter
of
the
feminine
toilette
pointed
out
to
her
by
chatelet
for
she
had
written
to
tell
the
marquise
of
her
arrival
mme
de
bargeton
possessed
the
born
of
a
long
habit
of
rule
but
she
was
exceedingly
afraid
of
appearing
to
be
provincial
she
had
tact
enough
to
know
how
greatly
the
relations
of
women
among
themselves
depend
upon
first
impressions
and
though
she
felt
that
she
was
equal
to
taking
her
place
at
once
in
such
a
distinguished
set
as
mme
de
she
felt
also
that
she
stood
in
need
of
goodwill
at
her
first
entrance
into
society
and
was
resolved
in
the
first
place
that
she
would
leave
nothing
undone
to
secure
success
so
she
felt
boundlessly
thankful
to
chatelet
for
pointing
out
these
ways
of
putting
herself
in
harmony
with
the
fashionable
world
a
singular
chance
so
ordered
it
that
the
marquise
was
delighted
to
find
an
opportunity
of
being
useful
to
a
connection
of
her
family
the
marquis
had
withdrawn
himself
without
apparent
reason
from
society
and
ceased
to
take
any
active
interest
in
affairs
political
or
domestic
his
wife
thus
left
mistress
of
her
actions
felt
the
need
of
the
support
of
public
opinion
and
was
glad
to
take
the
marquis
place
and
give
her
countenance
to
one
of
her
husband
relations
she
meant
to
be
ostentatiously
gracious
so
as
to
put
her
husband
more
evidently
in
the
wrong
and
that
very
day
she
wrote
mme
de
bargeton
negrepelisse
a
charming
billet
one
of
the
prettily
worded
compositions
of
which
time
alone
can
discover
the
emptiness
she
was
delighted
that
circumstances
had
brought
a
relative
of
whom
she
had
heard
whose
acquaintance
she
had
desired
to
make
into
closer
connection
with
her
family
friendships
in
paris
were
not
so
solid
but
that
she
longed
to
find
one
more
to
love
on
earth
and
if
this
might
not
be
there
would
only
be
one
more
illusion
to
bury
with
the
rest
she
put
herself
entirely
at
her
cousin
disposal
she
would
have
called
upon
her
if
indisposition
had
not
kept
her
to
the
house
and
she
felt
that
she
lay
already
under
obligations
to
the
cousin
who
had
thought
of
her
lucien
meanwhile
taking
his
first
ramble
along
the
rue
de
la
paix
and
through
the
boulevards
like
all
newcomers
was
much
more
interested
in
the
things
that
he
saw
than
in
the
people
he
met
the
general
effect
of
paris
is
wholly
engrossing
at
first
the
wealth
in
the
shop
windows
the
high
houses
the
streams
of
traffic
the
contrast
everywhere
between
the
last
extremes
of
luxury
and
want
struck
him
more
than
anything
else
in
his
astonishment
at
the
crowds
of
strange
faces
the
man
of
imaginative
temper
felt
as
if
he
himself
had
shrunk
as
it
were
immensely
a
man
of
any
consequence
in
his
native
place
where
he
can
not
go
out
but
he
meets
with
some
recognition
of
his
importance
at
every
step
does
not
readily
accustom
himself
to
the
sudden
and
total
extinction
of
his
consequence
you
are
somebody
in
your
own
country
in
paris
you
are
nobody
the
transition
between
the
first
state
and
the
last
should
be
made
gradually
for
the
too
abrupt
fall
is
something
like
annihilation
paris
could
not
fail
to
be
an
appalling
wilderness
for
a
young
poet
who
looked
for
an
echo
for
all
his
sentiments
a
confidant
for
all
his
thoughts
a
soul
to
share
his
least
sensations
lucien
had
not
gone
in
search
of
his
luggage
and
his
best
blue
coat
and
painfully
conscious
of
the
shabbiness
to
say
no
worse
of
his
clothes
he
went
to
mme
de
bargeton
feeling
that
she
must
have
returned
he
found
the
baron
du
chatelet
who
carried
them
both
off
to
dinner
at
the
de
lucien
head
was
dizzy
with
the
whirl
of
paris
the
baron
was
in
the
carriage
he
could
say
nothing
to
louise
but
he
squeezed
her
hand
and
she
gave
a
warm
response
to
the
mute
confidence
after
dinner
chatelet
took
his
guests
to
the
vaudeville
lucien
in
his
heart
was
not
over
well
pleased
to
see
chatelet
again
and
cursed
the
chance
that
had
brought
the
baron
to
paris
the
baron
said
that
ambition
had
brought
him
to
town
he
had
hopes
of
an
appointment
as
to
a
government
department
and
meant
to
take
a
seat
in
the
council
of
state
as
master
of
requests
he
had
come
to
paris
to
ask
for
fulfilment
of
the
promises
that
had
been
given
him
for
a
man
of
his
stamp
could
not
be
expected
to
remain
a
comptroller
all
his
life
he
would
rather
be
nothing
at
all
and
offer
himself
for
election
as
deputy
or
diplomacy
chatelet
grew
visibly
taller
lucien
dimly
began
to
recognize
in
this
elderly
beau
the
superiority
of
the
man
of
the
world
who
knows
paris
and
most
of
all
he
felt
ashamed
to
owe
his
evening
amusement
to
his
rival
and
while
the
poet
looked
ill
at
ease
and
awkward
her
royal
was
quite
in
his
element
he
smiled
at
his
hesitations
at
his
astonishment
at
the
questions
he
put
at
the
little
mistakes
which
the
latter
ignorantly
made
much
as
an
old
salt
laughs
at
an
apprentice
who
has
not
found
his
sea
legs
but
pleasure
at
seeing
a
play
for
the
first
time
in
paris
outweighed
the
annoyance
of
these
small
humiliations
that
evening
marked
an
epoch
in
lucien
career
he
put
away
a
good
many
of
his
ideas
as
to
provincial
life
in
the
course
of
it
his
horizon
widened
society
assumed
different
proportions
there
were
fair
parisiennes
in
fresh
and
elegant
toilettes
all
about
him
mme
de
bargeton
costume
tolerably
ambitious
though
it
was
looked
dowdy
by
comparison
the
material
like
the
fashion
and
the
color
was
out
of
date
that
way
of
arranging
her
hair
so
bewitching
in
angouleme
looked
frightfully
ugly
here
among
the
daintily
devised
coiffures
which
he
saw
in
every
direction
will
she
always
look
like
that
said
he
to
himself
ignorant
that
the
morning
had
been
spent
in
preparing
a
transformation
in
the
provinces
comparison
and
choice
are
out
of
the
question
when
a
face
has
grown
familiar
it
comes
to
possess
a
certain
beauty
that
is
taken
for
granted
but
transport
the
pretty
woman
of
the
provinces
to
paris
and
no
one
takes
the
slightest
notice
of
her
her
prettiness
is
of
the
comparative
degree
illustrated
by
the
saying
that
among
the
blind
the
are
kings
lucien
eyes
were
now
busy
comparing
mme
de
bargeton
with
other
women
just
as
she
herself
had
contrasted
him
with
chatelet
on
the
previous
day
and
mme
de
bargeton
on
her
part
permitted
herself
some
strange
reflections
upon
her
lover
the
poet
cut
a
poor
figure
notwithstanding
his
singular
beauty
the
sleeves
of
his
jacket
were
too
short
with
his
country
gloves
and
a
waistcoat
too
scanty
for
him
he
looked
prodigiously
ridiculous
compared
with
the
young
men
in
the
balcony
positively
pitiable
thought
mme
de
bargeton
chatelet
interested
in
her
without
presumption
taking
care
of
her
in
a
manner
that
revealed
a
profound
passion
chatelet
elegant
and
as
much
at
home
as
an
actor
treading
the
familiar
boards
of
his
theatre
in
two
days
had
recovered
all
the
ground
lost
in
the
past
six
months
ordinary
people
will
not
admit
that
our
sentiments
towards
each
other
can
totally
change
in
a
moment
and
yet
certain
it
is
that
two
lovers
not
seldom
fly
apart
even
more
quickly
than
they
drew
together
in
mme
de
bargeton
and
in
lucien
a
process
of
disenchantment
was
at
work
paris
was
the
cause
life
had
widened
out
before
the
eyes
as
society
came
to
wear
a
new
aspect
for
louise
nothing
but
an
accident
now
was
needed
to
sever
finally
the
bond
that
united
them
nor
was
that
blow
so
terrible
for
lucien
very
long
delayed
mme
de
bargeton
set
lucien
down
at
his
inn
and
drove
home
with
chatelet
to
the
intense
vexation
of
the
luckless
lover
what
will
they
say
about
me
he
wondered
as
he
climbed
the
stairs
to
his
dismal
room
that
poor
fellow
is
uncommonly
dull
said
chatelet
with
a
smile
when
the
door
was
closed
that
is
the
way
with
those
who
have
a
world
of
thoughts
in
their
heart
and
brain
men
who
have
so
much
in
them
to
give
out
in
great
works
long
dreamed
of
profess
a
certain
contempt
for
conversation
a
commerce
in
which
the
intellect
spends
itself
in
small
change
returned
the
haughty
negrepelisse
she
still
had
courage
to
defend
lucien
but
less
for
lucien
sake
than
for
her
own
i
grant
it
you
willingly
replied
the
baron
but
we
live
with
human
beings
and
not
with
books
there
dear
nais
i
see
how
it
is
there
is
nothing
between
you
yet
and
i
am
delighted
that
it
is
so
if
you
decide
to
bring
an
interest
of
a
kind
hitherto
lacking
into
your
life
let
it
not
be
this
genius
i
implore
you
how
if
you
have
made
a
mistake
suppose
that
in
a
few
days
time
when
you
have
compared
him
with
men
whom
you
will
meet
men
of
real
ability
men
who
have
distinguished
themselves
in
good
earnest
suppose
that
you
should
discover
dear
and
fair
siren
that
it
is
no
that
you
have
borne
into
port
on
your
dazzling
shoulders
but
a
little
ape
with
no
manners
and
no
capacity
a
presumptuous
fool
who
may
be
a
wit
in
but
turns
out
a
very
ordinary
specimen
of
a
young
man
in
paris
and
after
all
volumes
of
verse
come
out
every
week
here
the
worst
of
them
better
than
all
chardon
poetry
put
together
for
pity
sake
wait
and
compare
friday
is
opera
night
he
continued
as
the
carriage
turned
into
the
rue
mme
has
the
box
of
the
first
gentlemen
of
the
chamber
and
will
take
you
no
doubt
i
shall
go
to
mme
de
serizy
box
to
behold
you
in
your
glory
they
are
giving
said
she
next
morning
mme
de
bargeton
tried
to
arrange
a
suitable
toilette
in
which
to
call
on
her
cousin
mme
the
weather
was
rather
chilly
looking
through
the
dowdy
wardrobe
from
angouleme
she
found
nothing
better
than
a
certain
green
velvet
gown
trimmed
fantastically
enough
lucien
for
his
part
felt
that
he
must
go
at
once
for
his
celebrated
blue
best
coat
he
felt
aghast
at
the
thought
of
his
tight
jacket
and
determined
to
be
well
dressed
lest
he
should
meet
the
marquise
or
receive
a
sudden
summons
to
her
house
he
must
have
his
luggage
at
once
so
he
took
a
cab
and
in
two
hours
time
spent
three
or
four
francs
matter
for
much
subsequent
reflection
on
the
scale
of
the
cost
of
living
in
paris
having
dressed
himself
in
his
best
such
as
it
was
he
went
to
the
rue
and
on
the
doorstep
encountered
gentil
in
company
with
a
gorgeously
chasseur
i
was
just
going
round
to
you
sir
madame
gave
me
a
line
for
you
said
gentil
ignorant
of
parisian
forms
of
respect
and
accustomed
to
homely
provincial
ways
the
chasseur
took
the
poet
for
a
servant
lucien
tore
open
the
note
and
learned
that
mme
de
bargeton
had
gone
to
spend
the
day
with
the
marquise
she
was
going
to
the
opera
in
the
evening
but
she
told
lucien
to
be
there
to
meet
her
her
cousin
permitted
her
to
give
him
a
seat
in
her
box
the
marquise
was
delighted
to
procure
the
young
poet
that
pleasure
then
she
loves
me
my
fears
were
all
nonsense
said
lucien
to
himself
she
is
going
to
present
me
to
her
cousin
this
very
evening
he
jumped
for
joy
he
would
spend
the
day
that
separated
him
from
the
happy
evening
as
joyously
as
might
be
he
dashed
out
in
the
direction
of
the
tuileries
dreaming
of
walking
there
until
it
was
time
to
dine
at
very
and
now
behold
lucien
frisking
and
skipping
light
of
foot
because
light
of
heart
on
his
way
to
the
terrasse
des
feuillants
to
take
a
look
at
the
people
of
quality
on
promenade
there
pretty
women
walk
with
men
of
fashion
their
adorers
couples
greet
each
other
with
a
glance
as
they
pass
how
different
it
is
from
the
terrace
at
beaulieu
how
far
finer
the
birds
on
this
perch
than
the
angouleme
species
it
is
as
if
you
beheld
all
the
colors
that
glow
in
the
plumage
of
the
feathered
tribes
of
india
and
america
instead
of
the
sober
european
families
those
were
two
wretched
hours
that
lucien
spent
in
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
a
violent
revulsion
swept
through
him
and
he
sat
in
judgment
upon
himself
in
the
first
place
not
a
single
one
of
these
gilded
youths
wore
a
coat
the
few
exceptions
one
or
two
poor
wretches
a
clerk
here
and
there
an
annuitant
from
the
marais
could
be
ruled
out
on
the
score
of
age
and
hard
upon
the
discovery
of
a
distinction
between
morning
and
evening
dress
the
poet
quick
sensibility
and
keen
eyes
saw
likewise
that
his
shabby
old
clothes
were
not
fit
to
be
seen
the
defects
in
his
coat
branded
that
garment
as
ridiculous
the
cut
was
the
color
was
the
wrong
shade
of
blue
the
collar
outrageously
ungainly
the
coat
tails
by
dint
of
long
wear
overlapped
each
other
the
buttons
were
reddened
and
there
were
fatal
white
lines
along
the
seams
then
his
waistcoat
was
too
short
and
so
grotesquely
provincial
that
he
hastily
buttoned
his
coat
over
it
and
finally
no
man
of
any
pretension
to
fashion
wore
nankeen
trousers
men
wore
charming
fancy
materials
or
immaculate
white
and
every
one
had
straps
to
his
trousers
while
the
shrunken
hems
of
lucien
nether
garments
manifested
a
violent
antipathy
for
the
heels
of
boots
which
they
wedded
with
obvious
reluctance
lucien
wore
a
white
cravat
with
embroidered
ends
his
sister
had
seen
that
du
hautoy
and
de
chandour
wore
such
things
and
hastened
to
make
similar
ones
for
her
brother
here
no
one
appeared
to
wear
white
cravats
of
a
morning
except
a
few
grave
seniors
elderly
capitalists
and
austere
public
functionaries
until
in
the
street
on
the
other
side
of
the
railings
lucien
noticed
a
grocer
boy
walking
along
the
rue
de
rivoli
with
a
basket
on
his
head
him
the
man
of
angouleme
detected
in
the
act
of
sporting
a
cravat
with
both
ends
adorned
by
the
handiwork
of
some
adored
the
sight
was
a
stab
to
lucien
breast
penetrating
straight
to
that
organ
as
yet
undefined
the
seat
of
our
sensibility
the
region
whither
since
sentiment
has
had
any
existence
the
sons
of
men
carry
their
hands
in
any
excess
of
joy
or
anguish
do
not
accuse
this
chronicle
of
puerility
the
rich
to
be
sure
never
having
experienced
sufferings
of
this
kind
may
think
them
incredibly
petty
and
small
but
the
agonies
of
less
fortunate
mortals
are
as
well
worth
our
attention
as
crises
and
vicissitudes
in
the
lives
of
the
mighty
and
privileged
ones
of
earth
is
not
the
pain
equally
great
for
either
suffering
exalts
all
things
and
after
all
suppose
that
we
change
the
terms
and
for
a
suit
of
clothes
more
or
less
fine
put
instead
a
ribbon
or
a
star
or
a
title
have
not
brilliant
careers
been
tormented
by
reason
of
such
apparent
trifles
as
these
add
moreover
that
for
those
people
who
must
seem
to
have
that
which
they
have
not
the
question
of
clothes
is
of
enormous
importance
and
not
unfrequently
the
appearance
of
possession
is
the
shortest
road
to
possession
at
a
later
day
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
over
lucien
as
he
bethought
himself
that
he
must
make
his
first
appearance
before
the
marquise
in
this
dress
the
marquise
relative
of
a
first
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
a
woman
whose
house
was
frequented
by
the
most
illustrious
among
illustrious
men
in
every
field
i
look
like
an
apothecary
son
a
regular
he
raged
inwardly
watching
the
youth
of
the
faubourg
pass
under
his
eyes
graceful
spruce
fashionably
dressed
with
a
certain
uniformity
of
air
a
sameness
due
to
a
fineness
of
contour
and
a
certain
dignity
of
carriage
and
expression
though
at
the
same
time
each
one
differed
from
the
rest
in
the
setting
by
which
he
had
chosen
to
bring
his
personal
characteristics
into
prominence
each
one
made
the
most
of
his
personal
advantages
young
men
in
paris
understand
the
art
of
presenting
themselves
quite
as
well
as
women
lucien
had
inherited
from
his
mother
the
invaluable
physical
distinction
of
race
but
the
metal
was
still
in
the
ore
and
not
set
free
by
the
craftsman
hand
his
hair
was
badly
cut
instead
of
holding
himself
upright
with
an
elastic
corset
he
felt
that
he
was
cooped
up
inside
a
hideous
he
hung
his
dejected
head
without
resistance
on
the
part
of
a
limp
cravat
what
woman
could
guess
that
a
handsome
foot
was
hidden
by
the
clumsy
boots
which
he
had
brought
from
angouleme
what
young
man
could
envy
him
his
graceful
figure
disguised
by
the
shapeless
blue
sack
which
hitherto
he
had
mistakenly
believed
to
be
a
coat
what
bewitching
studs
he
saw
on
those
dazzling
white
shirt
fronts
his
own
looked
dingy
by
comparison
and
how
marvelously
all
these
elegant
persons
were
gloved
his
own
gloves
were
only
fit
for
a
policeman
yonder
was
a
youth
toying
with
a
cane
exquisitely
mounted
there
another
with
dainty
gold
studs
in
his
wristbands
yet
another
was
twisting
a
charming
while
he
talked
with
a
woman
there
were
specks
of
mud
on
the
ample
folds
of
his
white
trousers
he
wore
clanking
spurs
and
a
jacket
evidently
he
was
about
to
mount
one
of
the
two
horses
held
by
a
of
a
tiger
a
young
man
who
went
past
drew
a
watch
no
thicker
than
a
piece
from
his
pocket
and
looked
at
it
with
the
air
of
a
person
who
is
either
too
early
or
too
late
for
an
appointment
lucien
seeing
these
petty
trifles
hitherto
unimagined
became
aware
of
a
whole
world
of
indispensable
superfluities
and
shuddered
to
think
of
the
enormous
capital
needed
by
a
professional
pretty
fellow
the
more
he
admired
these
gay
and
careless
beings
the
more
conscious
he
grew
of
his
own
outlandishness
he
knew
that
he
looked
like
a
man
who
has
no
idea
of
the
direction
of
the
streets
who
stands
close
to
the
palais
royal
and
can
not
find
it
and
asks
his
way
to
the
louvre
of
a
who
tells
him
here
you
are
lucien
saw
a
great
gulf
fixed
between
him
and
this
new
world
and
asked
himself
how
he
might
cross
over
for
he
meant
to
be
one
of
these
delicate
slim
youths
of
paris
these
young
patricians
who
bowed
before
women
divinely
dressed
and
divinely
fair
for
one
kiss
from
one
of
these
lucien
was
ready
to
be
cut
in
pieces
like
count
philip
of
konigsmark
louise
face
rose
up
somewhere
in
the
shadowy
background
of
memory
compared
with
these
queens
she
looked
like
an
old
woman
he
saw
women
whose
names
will
appear
in
the
history
of
the
nineteenth
century
women
no
less
famous
than
the
queens
of
past
times
for
their
wit
their
beauty
or
their
lovers
one
who
passed
was
the
heroine
mlle
des
touches
so
well
known
as
camille
maupin
the
great
woman
of
letters
great
by
her
intellect
great
no
less
by
her
beauty
he
overheard
the
name
pronounced
by
those
who
went
by
ah
he
thought
to
himself
she
is
poetry
what
was
mme
de
bargeton
in
comparison
with
this
angel
in
all
the
glory
of
youth
and
hope
and
promise
of
the
future
with
that
sweet
smile
of
hers
and
the
great
dark
eyes
with
all
heaven
in
them
and
the
glowing
light
of
the
sun
she
was
laughing
and
chatting
with
mme
firmiani
one
of
the
most
charming
women
in
paris
a
voice
indeed
cried
intellect
is
the
lever
by
which
to
move
the
world
but
another
voice
cried
no
less
loudly
that
money
was
the
fulcrum
he
would
not
stay
any
longer
on
the
scene
of
his
collapse
and
defeat
and
went
towards
the
palais
royal
he
did
not
know
the
topography
of
his
quarter
yet
and
was
obliged
to
ask
his
way
then
he
went
to
very
and
ordered
dinner
by
way
of
an
initiation
into
the
pleasures
of
paris
and
a
solace
for
his
discouragement
a
bottle
of
bordeaux
oysters
from
ostend
a
dish
of
fish
a
partridge
a
dish
of
macaroni
and
dessert
this
was
the
plus
of
his
desire
he
enjoyed
this
little
debauch
studying
the
while
how
to
give
the
marquise
proof
of
his
wit
and
redeem
the
shabbiness
of
his
grotesque
accoutrements
by
the
display
of
intellectual
riches
the
total
of
the
bill
drew
him
down
from
these
dreams
and
left
him
the
poorer
by
fifty
of
the
francs
which
were
to
have
gone
such
a
long
way
in
paris
he
could
have
lived
in
angouleme
for
a
month
on
the
price
of
that
dinner
wherefore
he
closed
the
door
of
the
palace
with
awe
thinking
as
he
did
so
that
he
should
never
set
foot
in
it
again
eve
was
right
he
said
to
himself
as
he
went
back
under
the
stone
arcading
for
some
more
money
there
is
a
difference
between
paris
prices
and
prices
in
he
gazed
in
at
the
tailors
windows
on
the
way
and
thought
of
the
costumes
in
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
no
he
exclaimed
i
will
appear
before
mme
dressed
out
as
i
am
he
fled
to
his
inn
fleet
as
a
stag
rushed
up
to
his
room
took
out
a
hundred
crowns
and
went
down
again
to
the
palais
royal
where
his
future
elegance
lay
scattered
over
half
a
score
of
shops
the
first
tailor
whose
door
he
entered
tried
as
many
coats
upon
him
as
he
would
consent
to
put
on
and
persuaded
his
customer
that
all
were
in
the
very
latest
fashion
lucien
came
out
the
owner
of
a
green
coat
a
pair
of
white
trousers
and
a
fancy
waistcoat
for
which
outfit
he
gave
two
hundred
francs
ere
long
he
found
a
very
elegant
pair
of
shoes
that
fitted
his
foot
and
finally
when
he
had
made
all
necessary
purchases
he
ordered
the
tradespeople
to
send
them
to
his
address
and
inquired
for
a
hairdresser
at
seven
that
evening
he
called
a
cab
and
drove
away
to
the
opera
curled
like
a
saint
john
of
a
procession
day
elegantly
waistcoated
and
gloved
but
feeling
a
little
awkward
in
this
kind
of
sheath
in
which
he
found
himself
for
the
first
time
in
obedience
to
mme
de
bargeton
instructions
he
asked
for
the
box
reserved
for
the
first
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
the
man
at
the
box
office
looked
at
him
and
beholding
lucien
in
all
the
grandeur
assumed
for
the
occasion
in
which
he
looked
like
a
best
man
at
a
wedding
asked
lucien
for
his
order
i
have
no
order
then
you
can
not
go
in
said
the
man
at
the
box
office
drily
but
i
belong
to
mme
party
it
is
not
our
business
to
know
that
said
the
man
who
could
not
help
exchanging
a
barely
perceptible
smile
with
his
colleague
a
carriage
stopped
under
the
peristyle
as
he
spoke
a
chasseur
in
a
livery
which
lucien
did
not
recognize
let
down
the
step
and
two
women
in
evening
dress
came
out
of
the
brougham
lucien
had
no
mind
to
lay
himself
open
to
an
insolent
order
to
get
out
of
the
way
from
the
official
he
stepped
aside
to
let
the
two
ladies
pass
why
that
lady
is
the
marquise
whom
you
say
you
know
sir
said
the
man
ironically
lucien
was
so
much
the
more
confounded
because
mme
de
bargeton
did
not
seem
to
recognize
him
in
his
new
plumage
but
when
he
stepped
up
to
her
she
smiled
at
him
and
said
this
has
fallen
out
wonderfully
come
the
functionaries
at
the
box
office
grew
serious
again
as
lucien
followed
mme
de
bargeton
on
their
way
up
the
great
staircase
the
lady
introduced
de
rubempre
to
her
cousin
the
box
belonging
to
the
first
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
is
situated
in
one
of
the
angles
at
the
back
of
the
house
so
that
its
occupants
see
and
are
seen
all
over
the
theatre
lucien
took
his
seat
on
a
chair
behind
mme
de
bargeton
thankful
to
be
in
the
shadow
de
rubempre
said
the
marquise
with
flattering
graciousness
this
is
your
first
visit
to
the
opera
is
it
not
you
must
have
a
view
of
the
house
take
this
seat
sit
in
front
of
the
box
we
give
you
permission
lucien
obeyed
as
the
first
act
came
to
an
end
you
have
made
good
use
of
your
time
louise
said
in
his
ear
in
her
first
surprise
at
the
change
in
his
appearance
louise
was
still
the
same
the
near
presence
of
the
marquise
a
parisian
mme
de
bargeton
was
so
damaging
to
her
the
brilliancy
of
the
parisienne
brought
out
all
the
defects
in
her
country
cousin
so
clearly
by
contrast
that
lucien
looking
out
over
the
fashionable
audience
in
the
superb
building
and
then
at
the
great
lady
was
twice
enlightened
and
saw
poor
anais
de
negrepelisse
as
she
really
was
as
parisians
saw
her
a
tall
lean
withered
woman
with
a
pimpled
face
and
faded
complexion
angular
stiff
affected
in
her
manner
pompous
and
provincial
in
her
speech
and
and
above
all
these
things
dowdily
dressed
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
creases
in
an
old
dress
from
paris
still
bear
witness
to
good
taste
you
can
tell
what
the
gown
was
meant
for
but
an
old
dress
made
in
the
country
is
inexplicable
it
is
a
thing
to
provoke
laughter
there
was
neither
charm
nor
freshness
about
the
dress
or
its
wearer
the
velvet
like
the
complexion
had
seen
wear
lucien
felt
ashamed
to
have
fallen
in
love
with
this
bone
and
vowed
that
he
would
profit
by
louise
next
fit
of
virtue
to
leave
her
for
good
having
an
excellent
view
of
the
house
he
could
see
the
pointed
at
the
aristocratic
box
par
excellence
the
women
must
certainly
be
scrutinizing
mme
de
bargeton
for
they
smiled
and
talked
among
themselves
if
mme
knew
the
object
of
their
sarcasms
from
those
feminine
smiles
and
gestures
she
was
perfectly
insensible
to
them
in
the
first
place
anybody
must
see
that
her
companion
was
a
poor
relation
from
the
country
an
affliction
with
which
any
parisian
family
may
be
visited
and
in
the
second
when
her
cousin
had
spoken
to
her
of
her
dress
with
manifest
misgivings
she
had
reassured
anais
seeing
that
when
once
properly
dressed
her
relative
would
very
easily
acquire
the
tone
of
parisian
society
if
mme
de
bargeton
needed
polish
on
the
other
hand
she
possessed
the
native
haughtiness
of
good
birth
and
that
indescribable
something
which
may
be
called
pedigree
so
on
monday
her
turn
would
come
and
moreover
the
marquise
knew
that
as
soon
as
people
learned
that
the
stranger
was
her
cousin
they
would
suspend
their
banter
and
look
twice
before
they
condemned
her
lucien
did
not
foresee
the
change
in
louise
appearance
shortly
to
be
worked
by
a
scarf
about
her
throat
a
pretty
dress
an
elegant
coiffure
and
mme
advice
as
they
came
up
the
staircase
even
now
the
marquise
told
her
cousin
not
to
hold
her
handkerchief
unfolded
in
her
hand
good
or
bad
taste
turns
upon
hundreds
of
such
almost
imperceptible
shades
which
a
woman
discerns
at
once
while
others
will
never
grasp
them
mme
de
bargeton
plentifully
apt
was
more
than
clever
enough
to
discover
her
shortcomings
mme
sure
that
her
pupil
would
do
her
credit
did
not
decline
to
form
her
in
short
the
compact
between
the
two
women
had
been
confirmed
by
on
either
side
mme
de
bargeton
enthralled
dazzled
and
fascinated
by
her
manner
wit
and
acquaintances
had
suddenly
declared
herself
a
votary
of
the
idol
of
the
day
she
had
discerned
the
signs
of
the
occult
power
exerted
by
the
ambitious
great
lady
and
told
herself
that
she
could
gain
her
end
as
the
satellite
of
this
star
so
she
had
been
outspoken
in
her
admiration
the
marquise
was
not
insensible
to
the
artlessly
admitted
conquest
she
took
an
interest
in
her
cousin
seeing
that
she
was
weak
and
poor
she
was
besides
not
indisposed
to
take
a
pupil
with
whom
to
found
a
school
and
asked
nothing
better
than
to
have
a
sort
of
in
mme
de
bargeton
a
dependent
who
would
sing
her
praises
a
treasure
even
more
scarce
among
parisian
women
than
a
staunch
and
loyal
critic
among
the
literary
tribe
the
flutter
of
curiosity
in
the
house
was
too
marked
to
be
ignored
however
and
mme
politely
endeavored
to
turn
her
cousin
mind
from
the
truth
if
any
one
comes
to
our
box
she
said
perhaps
we
may
discover
the
cause
to
which
we
owe
the
honor
of
the
interest
that
these
ladies
are
taking
i
have
a
strong
suspicion
that
it
is
my
old
velvet
gown
and
angoumoisin
air
which
parisian
ladies
find
amusing
mme
de
bargeton
answered
laughing
no
it
is
not
you
it
is
something
that
i
can
not
explain
she
added
turning
to
the
poet
and
as
she
looked
at
him
for
the
first
time
it
seemed
to
strike
her
that
he
was
singularly
dressed
there
is
du
chatelet
exclaimed
lucien
at
that
moment
and
he
pointed
a
finger
towards
mme
de
serizy
box
which
the
renovated
beau
had
just
entered
mme
de
bargeton
bit
her
lips
with
chagrin
as
she
saw
that
gesture
and
saw
besides
the
marquise
smile
of
contemptuous
astonishment
where
does
the
young
man
come
from
her
look
said
and
louise
felt
humbled
through
her
love
one
of
the
sharpest
of
all
pangs
for
a
frenchwoman
a
mortification
for
which
she
can
not
forgive
her
lover
in
these
circles
where
trifles
are
of
such
importance
a
gesture
or
a
word
at
the
outset
is
enough
to
ruin
a
newcomer
it
is
the
principal
merit
of
fine
manners
and
the
highest
breeding
that
they
produce
the
effect
of
a
harmonious
whole
in
which
every
element
is
so
blended
that
nothing
is
startling
or
obtrusive
even
those
who
break
the
laws
of
this
science
either
through
ignorance
or
carried
away
by
some
impulse
must
comprehend
that
it
is
with
social
intercourse
as
with
music
a
single
discordant
note
is
a
complete
negation
of
the
art
itself
for
the
harmony
exists
only
when
all
its
conditions
are
observed
down
to
the
least
particular
who
is
that
gentleman
asked
mme
looking
towards
chatelet
and
have
you
made
mme
de
serizy
acquaintance
already
oh
is
that
the
famous
mme
de
serizy
who
has
had
so
many
adventures
and
yet
goes
everywhere
an
my
dear
explicable
but
unexplained
the
most
formidable
men
are
her
friends
and
why
nobody
dares
to
fathom
the
mystery
then
is
this
person
the
lion
of
angouleme
well
le
baron
du
chatelet
has
been
a
good
deal
talked
about
answered
mme
de
bargeton
moved
by
vanity
to
give
her
adorer
the
title
which
she
herself
had
called
in
question
he
was
de
montriveau
traveling
companion
ah
said
the
marquise
i
never
hear
that
name
without
thinking
of
the
duchesse
de
langeais
poor
thing
she
vanished
like
a
falling
that
is
de
rastignac
with
mme
de
nucingen
she
continued
indicating
another
box
she
is
the
wife
of
a
contractor
a
banker
a
city
man
a
broker
on
a
large
scale
he
forced
his
way
into
society
with
his
money
and
they
say
that
he
is
not
very
scrupulous
as
to
his
methods
of
making
it
he
is
at
endless
pains
to
establish
his
credit
as
a
staunch
upholder
of
the
bourbons
and
has
tried
already
to
gain
admittance
into
my
set
when
his
wife
took
mme
de
langeais
box
she
thought
that
she
could
take
her
charm
her
wit
and
her
success
as
well
it
is
the
old
fable
of
the
jay
in
the
peacock
feathers
how
do
and
mme
de
rastignac
manage
to
keep
their
son
in
paris
when
as
we
know
their
income
is
under
a
thousand
crowns
asked
lucien
in
his
astonishment
at
rastignac
elegant
and
expensive
dress
it
is
easy
to
see
that
you
come
from
angouleme
said
mme
ironically
enough
as
she
continued
to
gaze
through
her
her
remark
was
lost
upon
lucien
the
spectacle
of
the
boxes
prevented
him
from
thinking
of
anything
else
he
guessed
that
he
himself
was
an
object
of
no
small
curiosity
louise
on
the
other
hand
was
exceedingly
mortified
by
the
evident
slight
esteem
in
which
the
marquise
held
lucien
beauty
he
can
not
be
so
handsome
as
i
thought
him
she
said
to
herself
and
between
not
so
handsome
and
not
so
clever
as
i
thought
him
there
was
but
one
step
the
curtain
fell
chatelet
was
now
paying
a
visit
to
the
duchesse
de
carigliano
in
an
adjourning
box
mme
de
bargeton
acknowledged
his
bow
by
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head
nothing
escapes
a
woman
of
the
world
chatelet
air
of
distinction
was
not
lost
upon
mme
just
at
that
moment
four
personages
four
parisian
celebrities
came
into
the
box
one
after
another
the
most
striking
feature
of
the
first
comer
de
marsay
famous
for
the
passions
which
he
had
inspired
was
his
girlish
beauty
but
its
softness
and
effeminacy
were
counteracted
by
the
expression
of
his
eyes
unflinching
steady
untamed
and
hard
as
a
tiger
he
was
loved
and
he
was
feared
lucien
was
no
less
handsome
but
expression
was
so
gentle
his
blue
eyes
so
limpid
that
he
scarcely
seemed
to
possess
the
strength
and
the
power
which
attract
women
so
strongly
nothing
moreover
so
far
had
brought
out
the
poet
merits
while
de
marsay
with
his
flow
of
spirits
his
confidence
in
his
power
to
please
and
appropriate
style
of
dress
eclipsed
every
rival
by
his
presence
judge
therefore
the
kind
of
figure
that
lucien
stiff
starched
unbending
in
clothes
as
new
and
unfamiliar
as
his
surroundings
was
likely
to
cut
in
de
marsay
vicinity
de
marsay
with
his
wit
and
charm
of
manner
was
privileged
to
be
insolent
from
mme
reception
of
this
personage
his
importance
was
at
once
evident
to
mme
de
bargeton
the
second
comer
was
a
vandenesse
the
cause
of
the
scandal
in
which
lady
dudley
was
concerned
felix
de
vandenesse
amiable
intellectual
and
modest
had
none
of
the
characteristics
on
which
de
marsay
prided
himself
and
owed
his
success
to
diametrically
opposed
qualities
he
had
been
warmly
recommended
to
mme
by
her
cousin
mme
de
mortsauf
the
third
was
general
de
montriveau
the
author
of
the
duchesse
de
langeais
ruin
the
fourth
de
canalis
one
of
the
most
famous
poets
of
the
day
and
as
yet
a
newly
risen
celebrity
was
prouder
of
his
birth
than
of
his
genius
and
dangled
in
mme
train
by
way
of
concealing
his
love
for
the
duchesse
de
chaulieu
in
spite
of
his
graces
and
the
affectation
that
spoiled
them
it
was
easy
to
discern
the
vast
lurking
ambitions
that
plunged
him
at
a
later
day
into
the
storms
of
political
life
a
face
that
might
be
called
insignificantly
pretty
and
caressing
manners
thinly
disguised
the
man
egoism
and
habit
of
continually
calculating
the
chances
of
a
career
which
at
that
time
looked
problematical
enough
though
his
choice
of
mme
de
chaulieu
a
woman
past
forty
made
interest
for
him
at
court
and
brought
him
the
applause
of
the
faubourg
and
the
gibes
of
the
liberal
party
who
dubbed
him
the
poet
of
the
sacristy
mme
de
bargeton
with
these
remarkable
figures
before
her
no
longer
wondered
at
the
slight
esteem
in
which
the
marquise
held
lucien
good
looks
and
when
conversation
began
when
intellects
so
keen
so
subtle
were
revealed
in
words
with
more
meaning
and
depth
in
them
than
anais
de
bargeton
heard
in
a
month
of
talk
at
angouleme
and
most
of
all
when
canalis
uttered
a
sonorous
phrase
summing
up
a
materialistic
epoch
and
gilding
it
with
poetry
then
anais
felt
all
the
truth
of
chatelet
dictum
of
the
previous
evening
lucien
was
nothing
to
her
now
every
one
cruelly
ignored
the
unlucky
stranger
he
was
so
much
like
a
foreigner
listening
to
an
unknown
language
that
the
marquise
took
pity
upon
him
she
turned
to
canalis
permit
me
to
introduce
de
rubempre
she
said
you
rank
too
high
in
the
world
of
letters
not
to
welcome
a
de
rubempre
is
from
angouleme
and
will
need
your
influence
no
doubt
with
the
powers
that
bring
genius
to
light
so
far
he
has
no
enemies
to
help
him
to
success
by
their
attacks
upon
him
is
there
enough
originality
in
the
idea
of
obtaining
for
him
by
friendship
all
that
hatred
has
done
for
you
to
tempt
you
to
make
the
experiment
the
four
newcomers
all
looked
at
lucien
while
the
marquise
was
speaking
de
marsay
only
a
couple
of
paces
away
put
up
an
eyeglass
and
looked
from
lucien
to
mme
de
bargeton
and
then
again
at
lucien
coupling
them
with
some
mocking
thought
cruelly
mortifying
to
both
he
scrutinized
them
as
if
they
had
been
a
pair
of
strange
animals
and
then
he
smiled
the
smile
was
like
a
stab
to
the
distinguished
provincial
felix
de
vandenesse
assumed
a
charitable
air
montriveau
looked
lucien
through
and
through
madame
de
canalis
answered
with
a
bow
i
will
obey
you
in
spite
of
the
selfish
instinct
which
prompts
us
to
show
a
rival
no
favor
but
you
have
accustomed
us
to
miracles
very
well
do
me
the
pleasure
of
dining
with
me
on
monday
with
de
rubempre
and
you
can
talk
of
matters
literary
at
your
ease
i
will
try
to
enlist
some
of
the
tyrants
of
the
world
of
letters
and
the
great
people
who
protect
them
the
author
of
and
one
or
two
young
poets
with
sound
views
mme
la
marquise
said
de
marsay
if
you
give
your
support
to
this
gentleman
for
his
intellect
i
will
support
him
for
his
good
looks
i
will
give
him
advice
which
will
put
him
in
a
fair
way
to
be
the
luckiest
dandy
in
paris
after
that
he
may
be
a
poet
if
he
has
a
mind
mme
de
bargeton
thanked
her
cousin
by
a
grateful
glance
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
jealous
of
intellect
montriveau
said
turning
to
de
marsay
good
fortune
is
the
death
of
a
poet
is
that
why
your
lordship
is
thinking
of
marriage
inquired
the
dandy
addressing
canalis
and
watching
mme
to
see
if
the
words
went
home
canalis
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
mme
mme
de
niece
began
to
laugh
lucien
in
his
new
clothes
felt
as
if
he
were
an
egyptian
statue
in
its
narrow
sheath
he
was
ashamed
that
he
had
nothing
to
say
for
himself
all
this
while
at
length
he
turned
to
the
marquise
after
all
your
kindness
madame
i
am
pledged
to
make
no
failures
he
said
in
those
soft
tones
of
his
chatelet
came
in
as
he
spoke
he
had
seen
montriveau
and
by
hook
or
crook
snatched
at
the
chance
of
a
good
introduction
to
the
marquise
through
one
of
the
kings
of
paris
he
bowed
to
mme
de
bargeton
and
begged
mme
to
pardon
him
for
the
liberty
he
took
in
invading
her
box
he
had
been
separated
so
long
from
his
traveling
companion
montriveau
and
chatelet
met
for
the
first
time
since
they
parted
in
the
desert
to
part
in
the
desert
and
meet
again
in
the
said
lucien
quite
a
theatrical
meeting
said
canalis
montriveau
introduced
the
baron
du
chatelet
to
the
marquise
and
the
marquise
received
her
royal
highness
the
more
graciously
because
she
had
seen
that
he
had
been
very
well
received
in
three
boxes
already
mme
de
serizy
knew
none
but
unexceptionable
people
and
moreover
he
was
montriveau
traveling
companion
so
potent
was
this
last
credential
that
mme
de
bargeton
saw
from
the
manner
of
the
group
that
they
accepted
chatelet
as
one
of
themselves
without
demur
chatelet
sultan
airs
in
angouleme
were
suddenly
explained
at
length
the
baron
saw
lucien
and
favored
him
with
a
cool
disparaging
little
nod
indicative
to
men
of
the
world
of
the
recipient
inferior
station
a
sardonic
expression
accompanied
the
greeting
how
does
come
here
he
seemed
to
say
this
was
not
lost
on
those
who
saw
it
for
de
marsay
leaned
towards
montriveau
and
said
in
tones
audible
to
chatelet
do
ask
him
who
the
young
fellow
is
that
looks
like
a
dummy
at
a
tailor
chatelet
spoke
a
few
words
in
his
traveling
companion
ear
and
while
apparently
renewing
his
acquaintance
no
doubt
cut
his
rival
to
pieces
if
lucien
was
surprised
at
the
apt
wit
and
the
subtlety
with
which
these
gentlemen
formulated
their
replies
he
felt
bewildered
with
epigram
and
repartee
and
most
of
all
by
their
offhand
way
of
talking
and
their
ease
of
manner
the
material
luxury
of
paris
had
alarmed
him
that
morning
at
night
he
saw
the
same
lavish
expenditure
of
intellect
by
what
mysterious
means
he
asked
himself
did
these
people
make
such
piquant
reflections
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
those
repartees
which
he
could
only
have
made
after
much
pondering
and
not
only
were
they
at
ease
in
their
speech
they
were
at
ease
in
their
dress
nothing
looked
new
nothing
looked
old
nothing
about
them
was
conspicuous
everything
attracted
the
eyes
the
fine
gentleman
of
was
the
same
yesterday
and
would
be
the
same
lucien
guessed
that
he
himself
looked
as
if
he
were
dressed
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
my
dear
fellow
said
de
marsay
addressing
felix
de
vandenesse
that
young
rastignac
is
soaring
away
like
a
look
at
him
in
the
marquise
de
listomere
box
he
is
making
progress
he
is
putting
up
his
eyeglass
at
us
he
knows
this
gentleman
no
doubt
added
the
dandy
speaking
to
lucien
and
looking
elsewhere
he
can
scarcely
fail
to
have
heard
the
name
of
a
great
man
of
whom
we
are
proud
said
mme
de
bargeton
quite
lately
his
sister
was
present
when
de
rubempre
read
us
some
very
fine
poetry
felix
de
vandenesse
and
de
marsay
took
leave
of
the
marquise
and
went
off
to
mme
de
listomere
vandenesse
sister
the
second
act
began
and
the
three
were
left
to
themselves
again
the
curious
women
learned
how
mme
de
bargeton
came
to
be
there
from
some
of
the
party
while
the
others
announced
the
arrival
of
a
poet
and
made
fun
of
his
costume
canalis
went
back
to
the
duchesse
de
chaulieu
and
no
more
was
seen
of
him
lucien
was
glad
when
the
rising
of
the
curtain
produced
a
diversion
all
mme
de
bargeton
misgivings
with
regard
to
lucien
were
increased
by
the
marked
attention
which
the
marquise
had
shown
to
chatelet
her
manner
towards
the
baron
was
very
different
from
the
patronizing
affability
with
which
she
treated
lucien
mme
de
listomere
box
was
full
during
the
second
act
and
to
all
appearance
the
talk
turned
upon
mme
de
bargeton
and
lucien
young
rastignac
evidently
was
entertaining
the
party
he
had
raised
the
laughter
that
needs
fresh
fuel
every
day
in
paris
the
laughter
that
seizes
upon
a
topic
and
exhausts
it
and
leaves
it
stale
and
threadbare
in
a
moment
mme
grew
uneasy
she
knew
that
an
speech
is
not
long
in
coming
to
the
ears
of
those
whom
it
will
wound
and
waited
till
the
end
of
the
act
after
a
revulsion
of
feeling
such
as
had
taken
place
in
mme
de
bargeton
and
lucien
strange
things
come
to
pass
in
a
brief
space
of
time
and
any
revolution
within
us
is
controlled
by
laws
that
work
with
great
swiftness
chatelet
sage
and
politic
words
as
to
lucien
spoken
on
the
way
home
from
the
vaudeville
were
fresh
in
memory
every
phrase
was
a
prophecy
it
seemed
as
if
lucien
had
set
himself
to
fulfil
the
predictions
one
by
one
when
lucien
and
mme
de
bargeton
had
parted
with
their
illusions
concerning
each
other
the
luckless
youth
with
a
destiny
not
unlike
rousseau
went
so
far
in
his
predecessor
footsteps
that
he
was
captivated
by
the
great
lady
and
smitten
with
mme
at
first
sight
young
men
and
men
who
remember
their
young
emotions
can
see
that
this
was
only
what
might
have
been
looked
for
mme
with
her
dainty
ways
her
delicate
enunciation
and
the
refined
tones
of
her
voice
the
fragile
woman
so
envied
of
such
high
place
and
high
degree
appeared
before
the
poet
as
mme
de
bargeton
had
appeared
to
him
in
angouleme
his
fickle
nature
prompted
him
to
desire
influence
in
that
lofty
sphere
at
once
and
the
surest
way
to
secure
such
influence
was
to
possess
the
woman
who
exerted
it
and
then
everything
would
be
his
he
had
succeeded
at
angouleme
why
should
he
not
succeed
in
paris
involuntarily
and
despite
the
novel
counter
fascination
of
the
stage
his
eyes
turned
to
the
celimene
in
her
splendor
he
glanced
furtively
at
her
every
moment
the
longer
he
looked
the
more
he
desired
to
look
at
her
mme
de
bargeton
caught
the
gleam
in
lucien
eyes
and
saw
that
he
found
the
marquise
more
interesting
than
the
opera
if
lucien
had
forsaken
her
for
the
fifty
daughters
of
danaus
she
could
have
borne
his
desertion
with
equanimity
but
another
glance
bolder
more
ardent
and
unmistakable
than
any
before
revealed
the
state
of
lucien
feelings
she
grew
jealous
but
not
so
much
for
the
future
as
for
the
past
he
never
gave
me
such
a
look
she
thought
dear
me
chatelet
was
right
then
she
saw
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
and
when
a
woman
once
begins
to
repent
of
her
weaknesses
she
sponges
out
the
whole
past
every
one
of
lucien
glances
roused
her
indignation
but
to
all
outward
appearance
she
was
calm
de
marsay
came
back
in
the
interval
bringing
de
listomere
with
him
and
that
serious
person
and
the
young
coxcomb
soon
informed
the
marquise
that
the
wedding
guest
in
his
holiday
suit
whom
she
had
the
bad
luck
to
have
in
her
box
had
as
much
right
to
the
appellation
of
rubempre
as
a
jew
to
a
baptismal
name
lucien
father
was
an
apothecary
named
chardon
de
rastignac
who
knew
all
about
angouleme
had
set
several
boxes
laughing
already
at
the
mummy
whom
the
marquise
styled
her
cousin
and
at
the
marquise
forethought
in
having
an
apothecary
at
hand
to
sustain
an
artificial
life
with
drugs
in
short
de
marsay
brought
a
selection
from
the
jokes
made
by
parisians
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
no
sooner
uttered
than
forgotten
chatelet
was
at
the
back
of
it
all
and
the
real
author
of
this
punic
faith
mme
turned
to
mme
de
bargeton
put
up
her
fan
and
said
my
dear
tell
me
if
your
protege
name
is
really
de
rubempre
he
has
assumed
his
mother
name
said
anais
uneasily
but
who
was
his
father
his
father
name
was
chardon
and
what
was
this
chardon
a
druggist
my
dear
friend
i
felt
quite
sure
that
all
paris
could
not
be
laughing
at
any
one
whom
i
took
up
i
do
not
care
to
stay
here
when
wags
come
in
in
high
glee
because
there
is
an
apothecary
son
in
my
box
if
you
will
follow
my
advice
we
will
leave
it
and
at
once
mme
expression
was
insolent
enough
lucien
was
at
a
loss
to
account
for
her
change
of
countenance
he
thought
that
his
waistcoat
was
in
bad
taste
which
was
true
and
that
his
coat
looked
like
a
caricature
of
the
fashion
which
was
likewise
true
he
discerned
in
bitterness
of
soul
that
he
must
put
himself
in
the
hands
of
an
expert
tailor
and
vowed
that
he
would
go
the
very
next
morning
to
the
most
celebrated
artist
in
paris
on
monday
he
would
hold
his
own
with
the
men
in
the
marquise
house
yet
lost
in
thought
though
he
was
he
saw
the
third
act
to
an
end
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
gorgeous
scene
upon
the
stage
dreamed
out
his
dream
of
mme
he
was
in
despair
over
her
sudden
coldness
it
gave
a
strange
check
to
the
ardent
reasoning
through
which
he
advanced
upon
this
new
love
undismayed
by
the
immense
difficulties
in
the
way
difficulties
which
he
saw
and
resolved
to
conquer
he
roused
himself
from
these
deep
musings
to
look
once
more
at
his
new
idol
turned
his
head
and
saw
that
he
was
alone
he
had
heard
a
faint
rustling
sound
the
door
closed
madame
had
taken
her
cousin
with
her
lucien
was
surprised
to
the
last
degree
by
the
sudden
desertion
he
did
not
think
long
about
it
however
simply
because
it
was
inexplicable
when
the
carriage
was
rolling
along
the
rue
de
richelieu
on
the
way
to
the
faubourg
the
marquise
spoke
to
her
cousin
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
irritation
my
dear
child
what
are
you
thinking
about
pray
wait
till
an
apothecary
son
has
made
a
name
for
himself
before
you
trouble
yourself
about
him
the
duchesse
de
chaulieu
does
not
acknowledge
canalis
even
now
and
he
is
famous
and
a
man
of
good
family
this
young
fellow
is
neither
your
son
nor
your
lover
i
suppose
added
the
haughty
dame
with
a
keen
inquisitive
glance
at
her
cousin
how
fortunate
for
me
that
i
kept
the
little
scapegrace
at
a
distance
thought
madame
de
bargeton
very
well
continued
the
marquise
taking
the
expression
in
her
cousin
eyes
for
an
answer
drop
him
i
beg
of
you
taking
an
illustrious
name
in
that
way
why
it
is
a
piece
of
impudence
that
will
meet
with
its
desserts
in
society
it
is
his
mother
name
i
dare
say
but
just
remember
dear
that
the
king
alone
can
confer
by
a
special
ordinance
the
title
of
de
rubempre
on
the
son
of
a
daughter
of
the
house
if
she
made
a
the
favor
would
be
enormous
only
to
be
granted
to
vast
wealth
or
conspicuous
services
or
very
powerful
influence
the
young
man
looks
like
a
shopman
in
his
sunday
suit
evidently
he
is
neither
wealthy
nor
noble
he
has
a
fine
head
but
he
seems
to
me
to
be
very
silly
he
has
no
idea
what
to
do
and
has
nothing
to
say
for
himself
in
fact
he
has
no
breeding
how
came
you
to
take
him
up
mme
de
bargeton
renounced
lucien
as
lucien
himself
had
renounced
her
a
ghastly
fear
lest
her
cousin
should
learn
the
manner
of
her
journey
shot
through
her
mind
dear
cousin
i
am
in
despair
that
i
have
compromised
you
people
do
not
compromise
me
mme
said
smiling
i
am
only
thinking
of
you
but
you
have
asked
him
to
dine
with
you
on
monday
i
shall
be
ill
the
marquise
said
quickly
you
can
tell
him
so
and
i
shall
leave
orders
that
he
is
not
to
be
admitted
under
either
name
during
the
interval
lucien
noticed
that
every
one
was
walking
up
and
down
the
lobby
he
would
do
the
same
in
the
first
place
not
one
of
mme
visitors
recognized
him
nor
paid
any
attention
to
him
their
conduct
seemed
nothing
less
than
extraordinary
to
the
provincial
poet
and
secondly
chatelet
on
whom
he
tried
to
hang
watched
him
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
fought
shy
of
him
lucien
walked
to
and
fro
watching
the
eddying
crowd
of
men
till
he
felt
convinced
that
his
costume
was
absurd
and
he
went
back
to
his
box
ensconced
himself
in
a
corner
and
stayed
there
till
the
end
at
times
he
thought
of
nothing
but
the
magnificent
spectacle
of
the
ballet
in
the
great
inferno
scene
in
the
fifth
act
sometimes
the
sight
of
the
house
absorbed
him
sometimes
his
own
thoughts
he
had
seen
society
in
paris
and
the
sight
had
stirred
him
to
the
depths
so
this
is
my
kingdom
he
said
to
himself
this
is
the
world
that
i
must
conquer
as
he
walked
home
through
the
streets
he
thought
over
all
that
had
been
said
by
mme
courtiers
memory
reproducing
with
strange
faithfulness
their
demeanor
their
gestures
their
manner
of
coming
and
going
next
day
towards
noon
lucien
betook
himself
to
staub
the
great
tailor
of
that
day
partly
by
dint
of
entreaties
and
partly
by
virtue
of
cash
lucien
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
promise
that
his
clothes
should
be
ready
in
time
for
the
great
day
staub
went
so
far
as
to
give
his
word
that
a
perfectly
elegant
coat
a
waistcoat
and
a
pair
of
trousers
should
be
forthcoming
lucien
then
ordered
linen
and
a
little
outfit
in
short
of
a
and
a
celebrated
bootmaker
measured
him
for
shoes
and
boots
he
bought
a
neat
walking
cane
at
verdier
he
went
to
mme
irlande
for
gloves
and
shirt
studs
in
short
he
did
his
best
to
reach
the
climax
of
dandyism
when
he
had
satisfied
all
his
fancies
he
went
to
the
rue
and
found
that
louise
had
gone
out
she
was
dining
with
mme
la
marquise
her
maid
said
and
would
not
be
back
till
late
lucien
dined
for
two
francs
at
a
restaurant
in
the
palais
royal
and
went
to
bed
early
the
next
day
was
sunday
he
went
to
lodging
at
eleven
louise
had
not
yet
risen
at
two
he
returned
once
more
madame
can
not
see
anybody
yet
reported
albertine
but
she
gave
me
a
line
for
you
can
not
see
anybody
yet
repeated
lucien
but
i
am
not
anybody
i
do
not
know
albertine
answered
very
impertinently
and
lucien
less
surprised
by
albertine
answer
than
by
a
note
from
mme
de
bargeton
took
the
billet
and
read
the
following
discouraging
lines
mme
is
not
well
she
will
not
be
able
to
see
you
on
monday
i
am
not
feeling
very
well
myself
but
i
am
about
to
dress
and
go
to
keep
her
company
i
am
in
despair
over
this
little
disappointment
but
your
talents
reassure
me
you
will
make
your
way
without
charlatanism
and
no
signature
lucien
said
to
himself
he
found
himself
in
the
tuileries
before
he
knew
whither
he
was
walking
with
the
gift
of
which
accompanies
genius
he
began
to
suspect
that
the
chilly
note
was
but
a
warning
of
the
catastrophe
to
come
lost
in
thought
he
walked
on
and
on
gazing
at
the
monuments
in
the
place
louis
quinze
it
was
a
sunny
day
a
stream
of
fine
carriages
went
past
him
on
the
way
to
the
champs
elysees
following
the
direction
of
the
crowd
of
strollers
he
saw
the
three
or
four
thousand
carriages
that
turn
the
champs
elysees
into
an
improvised
longchamp
on
sunday
afternoons
in
summer
the
splendid
horses
the
toilettes
and
liveries
bewildered
him
he
went
further
and
further
until
he
reached
the
arc
de
triomphe
then
unfinished
what
were
his
feelings
when
as
he
returned
he
saw
mme
de
bargeton
and
mme
coming
towards
him
in
a
wonderfully
appointed
caleche
with
a
chasseur
behind
it
in
waving
plumes
and
that
green
uniform
which
he
knew
only
too
well
there
was
a
block
somewhere
in
the
row
and
the
carriages
waited
lucien
beheld
louise
transformed
beyond
recognition
all
the
colors
of
her
toilette
had
been
carefully
subordinated
to
her
complexion
her
dress
was
delicious
her
hair
gracefully
and
becomingly
arranged
her
hat
in
exquisite
taste
was
remarkable
even
beside
mme
that
leader
of
fashion
there
is
something
in
the
art
of
wearing
a
hat
that
escapes
definition
tilted
too
far
to
the
back
of
the
head
it
imparts
a
bold
expression
to
the
face
bring
it
too
far
forward
it
gives
you
a
sinister
look
tipped
to
one
side
it
has
a
jaunty
air
a
woman
wears
her
hat
exactly
as
she
means
to
wear
it
and
exactly
at
the
right
angle
mme
de
bargeton
had
solved
this
curious
problem
at
sight
a
dainty
girdle
outlined
her
slender
waist
she
had
adopted
her
cousin
gestures
and
tricks
of
manner
and
now
as
she
sat
by
mme
side
she
played
with
a
tiny
scent
bottle
that
dangled
by
a
slender
gold
chain
from
one
of
her
fingers
displayed
a
little
hand
without
seeming
to
do
so
she
had
modeled
herself
on
mme
without
mimicking
her
the
marquise
had
found
a
cousin
worthy
of
her
and
seemed
to
be
proud
of
her
pupil
the
men
and
women
on
the
footways
all
gazed
at
the
splendid
carriage
with
the
bearings
of
the
and
upon
the
panels
lucien
was
amazed
at
the
number
of
greetings
received
by
the
cousins
he
did
not
know
that
the
all
paris
which
consists
in
some
score
of
salons
was
well
aware
already
of
the
relationship
between
the
ladies
a
little
group
of
young
men
on
horseback
accompanied
the
carriage
in
the
bois
lucien
could
recognize
de
marsay
and
rastignac
among
them
and
could
see
from
their
gestures
that
the
pair
of
coxcombs
were
complimenting
mme
de
bargeton
upon
her
transformation
mme
was
radiant
with
health
and
grace
so
her
indisposition
was
simply
a
pretext
for
ridding
herself
of
him
for
there
had
been
no
mention
of
another
day
the
wrathful
poet
went
towards
the
caleche
he
walked
slowly
waited
till
he
came
in
full
sight
of
the
two
ladies
and
made
them
a
bow
mme
de
bargeton
would
not
see
him
but
the
marquise
put
up
her
eyeglass
and
deliberately
cut
him
he
had
been
disowned
by
the
sovereign
lords
of
angouleme
but
to
be
disowned
by
society
in
paris
was
another
thing
the
by
doing
their
utmost
to
mortify
lucien
admitted
his
power
and
acknowledged
him
as
a
man
for
mme
he
had
positively
no
existence
this
was
a
sentence
it
was
a
refusal
of
justice
poor
poet
a
deadly
cold
seized
on
him
when
he
saw
de
marsay
eying
him
through
his
glass
and
when
the
parisian
lion
let
that
optical
instrument
fall
it
dropped
in
so
singular
a
fashion
that
lucien
thought
of
the
of
the
guillotine
the
caleche
went
by
rage
and
a
craving
for
vengeance
took
possession
of
his
slighted
soul
if
mme
de
bargeton
had
been
in
his
power
he
could
have
cut
her
throat
at
that
moment
he
was
a
gloating
over
the
pleasure
of
sending
mme
to
the
scaffold
if
only
he
could
have
put
de
marsay
to
the
torture
with
refinements
of
savage
cruelty
canalis
went
by
on
horseback
bowing
to
the
prettiest
women
his
dress
elegant
as
became
the
most
dainty
of
poets
great
heavens
exclaimed
lucien
money
money
at
all
costs
money
is
the
one
power
before
which
the
world
bends
the
knee
no
cried
conscience
not
money
but
glory
and
glory
means
work
work
that
was
what
david
said
great
heavens
what
am
i
doing
here
but
i
will
triumph
i
will
drive
along
this
avenue
in
a
caleche
with
a
chasseur
behind
me
i
will
possess
a
marquise
and
flinging
out
the
wrathful
words
he
went
to
hurbain
to
dine
for
two
francs
next
morning
at
nine
he
went
to
the
rue
to
upbraid
louise
for
her
barbarity
but
mme
de
bargeton
was
not
at
home
to
him
and
not
only
so
but
the
porter
would
not
allow
him
to
go
up
to
her
rooms
so
he
stayed
outside
in
the
street
watching
the
house
till
noon
at
twelve
chatelet
came
out
looked
at
lucien
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
avoided
him
stung
to
the
quick
lucien
hurried
after
his
rival
and
chatelet
finding
himself
closely
pursued
turned
and
bowed
evidently
intending
to
shake
him
off
by
this
courtesy
spare
me
just
a
moment
for
pity
sake
sir
said
lucien
i
want
just
a
word
or
two
with
you
you
have
shown
me
friendship
i
now
ask
the
most
trifling
service
of
that
friendship
you
have
just
come
from
mme
de
bargeton
how
have
i
fallen
into
disgrace
with
her
and
mme
please
explain
chardon
do
you
know
why
the
ladies
left
you
at
the
opera
that
evening
asked
chatelet
with
treacherous
no
said
the
poor
poet
well
it
was
de
rastignac
who
spoke
against
you
from
the
beginning
they
asked
him
about
you
and
the
young
dandy
simply
said
that
your
name
was
chardon
and
not
de
rubempre
that
your
mother
was
a
monthly
nurse
that
your
father
when
he
was
alive
was
an
apothecary
in
a
suburb
of
angouleme
and
that
your
sister
a
charming
girl
gets
up
shirts
to
admiration
and
is
just
about
to
be
married
to
a
local
printer
named
sechard
such
is
the
world
you
no
sooner
show
yourself
than
it
pulls
you
to
pieces
de
marsay
came
to
mme
to
laugh
at
you
with
her
so
the
two
ladies
thinking
that
your
presence
put
them
in
a
false
position
went
out
at
once
do
not
attempt
to
go
to
either
house
if
mme
de
bargeton
continued
to
receive
your
visits
her
cousin
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
you
have
genius
try
to
avenge
yourself
the
world
looks
down
upon
you
look
down
in
your
turn
upon
the
world
take
refuge
in
some
garret
write
your
masterpieces
seize
on
power
of
any
kind
and
you
will
see
the
world
at
your
feet
then
you
can
give
back
the
bruises
which
you
have
received
and
in
the
very
place
where
they
were
given
mme
de
bargeton
will
be
the
more
distant
now
because
she
has
been
friendly
that
is
the
way
with
women
but
the
question
now
for
you
is
not
how
to
win
back
anais
friendship
but
how
to
avoid
making
an
enemy
of
her
i
will
tell
you
of
a
way
she
has
written
letters
to
you
send
all
her
letters
back
to
her
she
will
be
sensible
that
you
are
acting
like
a
gentleman
and
at
a
later
time
if
you
should
need
her
she
will
not
be
hostile
for
my
own
part
i
have
so
high
an
opinion
of
your
future
that
i
have
taken
your
part
everywhere
and
if
i
can
do
anything
here
for
you
you
will
always
find
me
ready
to
be
of
use
the
elderly
beau
seemed
to
have
grown
young
again
in
the
atmosphere
of
paris
he
bowed
with
frigid
politeness
but
lucien
haggard
and
undone
forgot
to
return
the
salutation
he
went
back
to
his
inn
and
there
found
the
great
staub
himself
come
in
person
not
so
much
to
try
his
customer
clothes
as
to
make
inquiries
of
the
landlady
with
regard
to
that
customer
financial
status
the
report
had
been
satisfactory
lucien
had
traveled
post
mme
de
bargeton
brought
him
back
from
vaudeville
last
thursday
in
her
carriage
staub
addressed
lucien
as
monsieur
le
comte
and
called
his
attention
to
the
artistic
skill
with
which
he
had
brought
a
charming
figure
into
relief
a
young
man
in
such
a
costume
has
only
to
walk
in
the
tuileries
he
said
and
he
will
marry
an
english
heiress
within
a
fortnight
lucien
brightened
a
little
under
the
influences
of
the
german
joke
the
perfect
fit
of
his
new
clothes
the
fine
cloth
and
the
sight
of
a
graceful
figure
which
met
his
eyes
in
the
vaguely
he
told
himself
that
paris
was
the
capital
of
chance
and
for
the
moment
he
believed
in
chance
had
he
not
a
volume
of
poems
and
a
magnificent
romance
entitled
archer
of
charles
in
manuscript
he
had
hope
for
the
future
staub
promised
the
overcoat
and
the
rest
of
the
clothes
the
next
day
the
next
day
the
bootmaker
and
tailor
all
returned
armed
each
with
his
bill
which
lucien
still
under
the
charm
of
provincial
habits
paid
forthwith
not
knowing
how
otherwise
to
rid
himself
of
them
after
he
had
paid
there
remained
but
three
hundred
and
sixty
francs
out
of
the
two
thousand
which
he
had
brought
with
him
from
angouleme
and
he
had
been
but
one
week
in
paris
nevertheless
he
dressed
and
went
to
take
a
stroll
in
the
terrassee
des
feuillants
he
had
his
day
of
triumph
he
looked
so
handsome
and
so
graceful
he
was
so
well
dressed
that
women
looked
at
him
two
or
three
were
so
much
struck
with
his
beauty
that
they
turned
their
heads
to
look
again
lucien
studied
the
gait
and
carriage
of
the
young
men
on
the
terrasse
and
took
a
lesson
in
fine
manners
while
he
meditated
on
his
three
hundred
and
sixty
francs
that
evening
alone
in
his
chamber
an
idea
occurred
to
him
which
threw
a
light
on
the
problem
of
his
existence
at
the
where
he
lived
on
the
plainest
fare
thinking
to
economize
in
this
way
he
asked
for
his
account
as
if
he
meant
to
leave
and
discovered
that
he
was
indebted
to
his
landlord
to
the
extent
of
a
hundred
francs
the
next
morning
was
spent
in
running
around
the
latin
quarter
recommended
for
its
cheapness
by
david
for
a
long
while
he
looked
about
till
finally
in
the
rue
de
cluny
close
to
the
sorbonne
he
discovered
a
place
where
he
could
have
a
furnished
room
for
such
a
price
as
he
could
afford
to
pay
he
settled
with
his
hostess
of
the
and
took
up
his
quarters
in
the
rue
de
cluny
that
same
day
his
removal
only
cost
him
the
cab
fare
when
he
had
taken
possession
of
his
poor
room
he
made
a
packet
of
mme
de
bargeton
letters
laid
them
on
the
table
and
sat
down
to
write
to
her
but
before
he
wrote
he
fell
to
thinking
over
that
fatal
week
he
did
not
tell
himself
that
he
had
been
the
first
to
be
faithless
that
for
a
sudden
fancy
he
had
been
ready
to
leave
his
louise
without
knowing
what
would
become
of
her
in
paris
he
saw
none
of
his
own
shortcomings
but
he
saw
his
present
position
and
blamed
mme
de
bargeton
for
it
she
was
to
have
lighted
his
way
instead
she
had
ruined
him
he
grew
indignant
he
grew
proud
he
worked
himself
into
a
paroxysm
of
rage
and
set
himself
to
compose
the
following
epistle
what
would
you
think
madame
of
a
woman
who
should
take
a
fancy
to
some
poor
and
timid
child
full
of
the
noble
superstitions
which
the
grown
man
calls
and
using
all
the
charms
of
woman
coquetry
all
her
most
delicate
ingenuity
should
feign
a
mother
love
to
lead
that
child
astray
her
fondest
promises
the
which
raised
his
wonder
cost
her
nothing
she
leads
him
on
tightens
her
hold
upon
him
sometimes
coaxing
sometimes
scolding
him
for
his
want
of
confidence
till
the
child
leaves
his
home
and
follows
her
blindly
to
the
shores
of
a
vast
sea
smiling
she
lures
him
into
a
frail
skiff
and
sends
him
forth
alone
and
helpless
to
face
the
storm
standing
safe
on
the
rock
she
laughs
and
wishes
him
luck
you
are
that
woman
i
am
that
child
the
child
has
a
keepsake
in
his
hands
something
which
might
betray
the
wrongs
done
by
your
beneficence
your
kindness
in
deserting
him
you
might
have
to
blush
if
you
saw
him
struggling
for
life
and
chanced
to
recollect
that
once
you
clasped
him
to
your
breast
when
you
read
these
words
the
keepsake
will
be
in
your
own
safe
keeping
you
are
free
to
forget
everything
once
you
pointed
out
fair
hopes
to
me
in
the
skies
i
awake
to
find
reality
in
the
squalid
poverty
of
paris
while
you
pass
and
others
bow
before
you
on
your
brilliant
path
in
the
great
world
i
i
whom
you
deserted
on
the
threshold
shall
be
shivering
in
the
wretched
garret
to
which
you
consigned
me
yet
some
pang
may
perhaps
trouble
your
mind
amid
festivals
and
pleasures
you
may
think
sometimes
of
the
child
whom
you
thrust
into
the
depths
if
so
madame
think
of
him
without
remorse
out
of
the
depths
of
his
misery
the
child
offers
you
the
one
thing
left
to
him
his
forgiveness
in
a
last
look
yes
madame
thanks
to
you
i
have
nothing
left
nothing
was
not
the
world
created
from
nothing
genius
should
follow
the
divine
example
i
begin
with
forgiveness
but
as
yet
i
know
not
whether
i
possess
the
power
you
need
only
tremble
lest
i
should
go
astray
for
you
would
be
answerable
for
my
sins
alas
i
pity
you
for
you
will
have
no
part
in
the
future
towards
which
i
go
with
work
as
my
guide
after
penning
this
rhetorical
effusion
full
of
the
sombre
dignity
which
an
artist
of
is
rather
apt
to
overdo
thoughts
went
back
to
them
at
home
he
saw
the
pretty
rooms
which
david
had
furnished
for
him
at
the
cost
of
part
of
his
little
store
and
a
vision
rose
before
him
of
quiet
simple
pleasures
in
the
past
shadowy
figures
came
about
him
he
saw
his
mother
and
eve
and
david
and
heard
their
sobs
over
his
and
at
that
he
began
to
cry
himself
for
he
felt
very
lonely
in
paris
and
friendless
and
forlorn
two
or
three
days
later
he
wrote
to
his
sister
my
dear
eve
when
a
sister
shares
the
life
of
a
brother
who
devotes
himself
to
art
it
is
her
sad
privilege
to
take
more
sorrow
than
joy
into
her
life
and
i
am
beginning
to
fear
that
i
shall
be
a
great
trouble
to
you
have
i
not
abused
your
goodness
already
have
not
all
of
you
sacrificed
yourselves
to
me
it
is
the
memory
of
the
past
so
full
of
family
happiness
that
helps
me
to
bear
up
in
my
present
loneliness
now
that
i
have
tasted
the
first
beginnings
of
poverty
and
the
treachery
of
the
world
of
paris
how
my
thoughts
have
flown
to
you
swift
as
an
eagle
back
to
its
eyrie
so
that
i
might
be
with
true
affection
again
did
you
see
sparks
in
the
candle
did
a
coal
pop
out
of
the
fire
did
you
hear
singing
in
your
ears
and
did
mother
say
is
thinking
of
us
and
david
answer
is
fighting
his
way
in
the
world
my
eve
i
am
writing
this
letter
for
your
eyes
only
i
can
not
tell
any
one
else
all
that
has
happened
to
me
good
and
bad
blushing
for
both
as
i
write
for
good
here
is
as
rare
as
evil
ought
to
be
you
shall
have
a
great
piece
of
news
in
a
very
few
words
mme
de
bargeton
was
ashamed
of
me
disowned
me
would
not
see
me
and
gave
me
up
nine
days
after
we
came
to
paris
she
saw
me
in
the
street
and
looked
another
way
when
simply
to
follow
her
into
the
society
to
which
she
meant
to
introduce
me
i
had
spent
seventeen
hundred
and
sixty
francs
out
of
the
two
thousand
i
brought
from
angouleme
the
money
so
hardly
scraped
together
did
you
spend
it
you
will
ask
paris
is
a
strange
bottomless
gulf
my
poor
sister
you
can
dine
here
for
less
than
a
franc
yet
the
simplest
dinner
at
a
fashionable
restaurant
costs
fifty
francs
there
are
waistcoats
and
trousers
to
be
had
for
four
francs
and
two
francs
each
but
a
fashionable
tailor
never
charges
less
than
a
hundred
francs
you
pay
for
everything
you
pay
a
halfpenny
to
cross
the
kennel
in
the
street
when
it
rains
you
can
not
go
the
least
little
way
in
a
cab
for
less
than
sous
i
have
been
staying
in
one
of
the
best
parts
of
paris
but
now
i
am
living
at
the
hotel
de
cluny
in
the
rue
de
cluny
one
of
the
poorest
and
darkest
slums
shut
in
between
three
churches
and
the
old
buildings
of
the
sorbonne
i
have
a
furnished
room
on
the
fourth
floor
it
is
very
bare
and
very
dirty
but
all
the
same
i
pay
fifteen
francs
a
month
for
it
for
breakfast
i
spend
a
penny
on
a
roll
and
a
halfpenny
for
milk
but
i
dine
very
decently
for
sous
at
a
restaurant
kept
by
a
man
named
flicoteaux
in
the
place
de
la
sorbonne
itself
my
expenses
every
month
will
not
exceed
sixty
francs
everything
included
until
the
winter
begins
at
least
i
hope
not
so
my
two
hundred
and
forty
francs
ought
to
last
me
for
the
first
four
months
between
now
and
then
i
shall
have
sold
archer
of
charles
and
the
no
doubt
do
not
be
in
the
least
uneasy
on
my
account
if
the
present
is
cold
and
bare
and
the
blue
distant
future
is
rich
and
splendid
most
great
men
have
known
the
vicissitudes
which
depress
but
can
not
overwhelm
me
plautus
the
great
comic
latin
poet
was
once
a
miller
lad
machiavelli
wrote
at
night
and
by
day
was
a
common
like
any
one
else
and
more
than
all
the
great
cervantes
who
lost
an
arm
at
the
battle
of
lepanto
and
helped
to
win
that
famous
day
was
called
a
handless
dotard
by
the
scribblers
of
his
day
there
was
an
interval
of
ten
years
between
the
appearance
of
the
first
part
and
the
second
of
his
sublime
for
lack
of
a
publisher
things
are
not
so
bad
as
that
nowadays
mortifications
and
want
only
fall
to
the
lot
of
unknown
writers
as
soon
as
a
man
name
is
known
he
grows
rich
and
i
will
be
rich
and
besides
i
live
within
myself
i
spend
half
the
day
at
the
bibliotheque
learning
all
that
i
want
to
learn
i
should
not
go
far
unless
i
knew
more
than
i
do
so
at
this
moment
i
am
almost
happy
in
a
few
days
i
have
fallen
in
with
my
life
very
gladly
i
begin
the
work
that
i
love
with
daylight
my
subsistence
is
secure
i
think
a
great
deal
and
i
study
i
do
not
see
that
i
am
open
to
attack
at
any
point
now
that
i
have
renounced
a
world
where
my
vanity
might
suffer
at
any
moment
the
great
men
of
every
age
are
obliged
to
lead
lives
apart
what
are
they
but
birds
in
the
forest
they
sing
nature
falls
under
the
spell
of
their
song
and
no
one
should
see
them
that
shall
be
my
lot
always
supposing
that
i
can
carry
out
my
ambitious
plans
mme
de
bargeton
i
do
not
regret
a
woman
who
could
behave
as
she
behaved
does
not
deserve
a
thought
nor
am
i
sorry
that
i
left
angouleme
she
did
wisely
when
she
flung
me
into
the
sea
of
paris
to
sink
or
swim
this
is
the
place
for
men
of
letters
and
thinkers
and
poets
here
you
cultivate
glory
and
i
know
how
fair
the
harvest
is
that
we
reap
in
these
days
nowhere
else
can
a
writer
find
the
living
works
of
the
great
dead
the
works
of
art
which
quicken
the
imagination
in
the
galleries
and
museums
here
nowhere
else
will
you
find
great
reference
libraries
always
open
in
which
the
intellect
may
find
pasture
and
lastly
here
in
paris
there
is
a
spirit
which
you
breathe
in
the
air
it
infuses
the
least
details
every
literary
creation
bears
traces
of
its
influence
you
learn
more
by
talk
in
a
cafe
or
at
a
theatre
in
one
half
hour
than
you
would
learn
in
ten
years
in
the
provinces
here
in
truth
wherever
you
go
there
is
always
something
to
see
something
to
learn
some
comparison
to
make
extreme
cheapness
and
excessive
dearness
there
is
paris
for
you
there
is
honeycomb
here
for
every
bee
every
nature
finds
its
own
nourishment
so
though
life
is
hard
for
me
just
now
i
repent
of
nothing
on
the
contrary
a
fair
future
spreads
out
before
me
and
my
heart
rejoices
though
it
is
saddened
for
the
moment
my
dear
sister
do
not
expect
letters
from
me
regularly
it
is
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
paris
that
one
really
does
not
know
how
the
time
goes
life
is
so
alarmingly
rapid
i
kiss
the
mother
and
you
and
david
more
tenderly
than
ever
lucien
the
name
of
flicoteaux
is
engraved
on
many
memories
few
indeed
were
the
students
who
lived
in
the
latin
quarter
during
the
last
twelve
years
of
the
restoration
and
did
not
frequent
that
temple
sacred
to
hunger
and
impecuniosity
there
a
dinner
of
three
courses
with
a
quarter
bottle
of
wine
or
a
bottle
of
beer
could
be
had
for
eighteen
sous
or
for
sous
the
quarter
bottle
becomes
a
bottle
flicoteaux
that
friend
of
youth
would
beyond
a
doubt
have
amassed
a
colossal
fortune
but
for
a
line
on
his
bill
of
fare
a
line
which
rival
establishments
are
wont
to
print
in
capital
letters
thus
bread
at
discretion
which
being
interpreted
should
read
indiscretion
flicoteaux
has
been
to
many
an
illustrious
name
verily
the
heart
of
more
than
one
great
man
ought
to
wax
warm
with
innumerable
recollections
of
inexpressible
enjoyment
at
the
sight
of
the
small
square
window
panes
that
look
upon
the
place
de
la
sorbonne
and
the
rue
flicoteaux
ii
and
flicoteaux
iii
respected
the
old
exterior
maintaining
the
dingy
hue
and
general
air
of
a
respectable
house
showing
thereby
the
depth
of
their
contempt
for
the
charlatanism
of
the
the
kind
of
advertisement
which
feasts
the
eyes
at
the
expense
of
the
stomach
to
which
your
modern
restaurant
almost
always
has
recourse
here
you
beheld
no
piles
of
game
never
destined
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
spit
no
fantastical
fish
to
justify
the
mountebank
remark
i
saw
a
fine
carp
i
expect
to
buy
it
this
day
week
instead
of
the
prime
vegetables
more
fittingly
described
by
the
word
primeval
artfully
displayed
in
the
window
for
the
delectation
of
the
military
man
and
his
fellow
the
nursemaid
honest
flicoteaux
exhibited
full
adorned
with
many
a
rivet
or
pyramids
of
stewed
prunes
to
rejoice
the
sight
of
the
customer
and
assure
him
that
the
word
dessert
with
which
other
handbills
made
too
free
was
in
this
case
no
charter
to
hoodwink
the
public
loaves
of
six
pounds
weight
cut
in
four
quarters
made
good
the
promise
of
bread
at
discretion
such
was
the
plenty
of
the
establishment
that
moliere
would
have
celebrated
it
if
it
had
been
in
existence
in
his
day
so
comically
appropriate
is
the
name
flicoteaux
still
subsists
so
long
as
students
are
minded
to
live
flicoteaux
will
make
a
living
you
feed
there
neither
more
nor
less
and
you
feed
as
you
work
with
morose
or
cheerful
industry
according
to
the
circumstances
and
the
temperament
at
that
time
his
establishment
consisted
of
two
at
right
angles
to
each
other
long
narrow
rooms
looking
respectively
on
the
rue
and
the
place
de
la
sorbonne
the
furniture
must
have
come
originally
from
the
refectory
of
some
abbey
for
there
was
a
monastic
look
about
the
lengthy
tables
where
the
serviettes
of
regular
customers
each
thrust
through
a
numbered
ring
of
crystallized
tin
plate
were
laid
by
their
places
flicoteaux
only
changed
the
serviettes
of
a
sunday
but
flicoteaux
ii
changed
them
twice
a
week
it
is
said
under
pressure
of
competition
which
threatened
his
dynasty
flicoteaux
restaurant
is
no
with
its
refinements
and
luxuries
it
is
a
workshop
where
suitable
tools
are
provided
and
everybody
gets
up
and
goes
as
soon
as
he
has
finished
the
coming
and
going
within
are
swift
there
is
no
dawdling
among
the
waiters
they
are
all
busy
every
one
of
them
is
wanted
the
fare
is
not
very
varied
the
potato
is
a
permanent
institution
there
might
not
be
a
single
tuber
left
in
ireland
and
prevailing
dearth
elsewhere
but
you
would
still
find
potatoes
at
flicoteaux
not
once
in
thirty
years
shall
you
miss
its
pale
gold
the
color
beloved
of
titian
sprinkled
with
chopped
verdure
the
potato
enjoys
a
privilege
that
women
might
envy
such
as
you
see
it
in
so
shall
you
find
it
in
mutton
cutlets
and
fillet
of
beef
at
flicoteaux
represent
black
game
and
fillet
of
sturgeon
at
very
they
are
not
on
the
regular
bill
of
fare
that
is
and
must
be
ordered
beforehand
beef
of
the
feminine
gender
there
prevails
the
young
of
the
bovine
species
appears
in
all
kinds
of
ingenious
disguises
when
the
whiting
and
mackerel
abound
on
our
shores
they
are
likewise
seen
in
large
numbers
at
flicoteaux
his
whole
establishment
indeed
is
directly
affected
by
the
caprices
of
the
season
and
the
vicissitudes
of
french
agriculture
by
eating
your
dinners
at
flicoteaux
you
learn
a
host
of
things
of
which
the
wealthy
the
idle
and
folk
indifferent
to
the
phases
of
nature
have
no
suspicion
and
the
student
penned
up
in
the
latin
quarter
is
kept
accurately
informed
of
the
state
of
the
weather
and
good
or
bad
seasons
he
knows
when
it
is
a
good
year
for
peas
or
french
beans
and
the
kind
of
salad
stuff
that
is
plentiful
when
the
great
market
is
glutted
with
cabbages
he
is
at
once
aware
of
the
fact
and
the
failure
of
the
beetroot
crop
is
brought
home
to
his
mind
a
slander
old
in
circulation
in
time
connected
the
appearance
of
with
a
mortality
among
horseflesh
few
parisian
restaurants
are
so
well
worth
seeing
every
one
at
flicoteaux
is
young
you
see
nothing
but
youth
and
although
earnest
faces
and
grave
gloomy
anxious
faces
are
not
lacking
you
see
hope
and
confidence
and
poverty
gaily
endured
dress
as
a
rule
is
careless
and
regular
comers
in
decent
clothes
are
marked
exceptions
everybody
knows
at
once
that
something
extraordinary
is
afoot
a
mistress
to
visit
a
theatre
party
or
some
excursion
into
higher
spheres
here
it
is
said
friendships
have
been
made
among
students
who
became
famous
men
in
after
days
as
will
be
seen
in
the
course
of
this
narrative
but
with
the
exception
of
a
few
knots
of
young
fellows
from
the
same
part
of
france
who
make
a
group
about
the
end
of
a
table
the
gravity
of
the
diners
is
hardly
relaxed
perhaps
this
gravity
is
due
to
the
catholicity
of
the
wine
which
checks
good
fellowship
of
any
kind
flicoteaux
frequenters
may
recollect
certain
sombre
and
mysterious
figures
enveloped
in
the
gloom
of
the
chilliest
penury
these
beings
would
dine
there
daily
for
a
couple
of
years
and
then
vanish
and
the
most
inquisitive
regular
comer
could
throw
no
light
on
the
disappearance
of
such
goblins
of
paris
friendships
struck
up
over
flicoteaux
dinners
were
sealed
in
neighboring
cafes
in
the
flames
of
heady
punch
or
by
the
generous
warmth
of
a
small
cup
of
black
coffee
glorified
by
a
dash
of
something
hotter
and
stronger
lucien
like
all
neophytes
was
modest
and
regular
in
his
habits
in
those
early
days
at
the
hotel
de
cluny
after
the
first
unlucky
venture
in
fashionable
life
which
absorbed
his
capital
he
threw
himself
into
his
work
with
the
first
earnest
enthusiasm
which
is
frittered
away
so
soon
over
the
difficulties
or
in
the
of
every
life
in
paris
the
most
luxurious
and
the
very
poorest
lives
are
equally
beset
with
temptations
which
nothing
but
the
fierce
energy
of
genius
or
the
morose
persistence
of
ambition
can
overcome
lucien
used
to
drop
in
at
flicoteaux
about
four
having
remarked
the
advantages
of
an
early
arrival
the
was
more
varied
and
there
was
still
some
chance
of
obtaining
the
dish
of
your
choice
like
all
imaginative
persons
he
had
taken
a
fancy
to
a
particular
seat
and
showed
discrimination
in
his
selection
on
the
very
first
day
he
had
noticed
a
table
near
the
counter
and
from
the
faces
of
those
who
sat
about
it
and
chance
snatches
of
their
talk
he
recognized
brothers
of
the
craft
a
sort
of
instinct
moreover
pointed
out
the
table
near
the
counter
as
a
spot
whence
he
could
parlay
with
the
owners
of
the
restaurant
in
time
an
acquaintance
would
grow
up
he
thought
and
then
in
the
day
of
distress
he
could
no
doubt
obtain
the
necessary
credit
so
he
took
his
place
at
a
small
square
table
close
to
the
desk
intended
probably
for
casual
comers
for
the
two
clean
serviettes
were
unadorned
with
rings
opposite
neighbor
was
a
thin
pallid
youth
to
all
appearance
as
poor
as
himself
his
handsome
face
was
somewhat
worn
already
it
told
of
hopes
that
had
vanished
leaving
lines
upon
his
forehead
and
barren
furrows
in
his
soul
where
seeds
had
been
sown
that
had
come
to
nothing
lucien
felt
drawn
to
the
stranger
by
these
tokens
his
sympathies
went
out
to
him
with
irresistible
fervor
after
a
week
exchange
of
small
courtesies
and
remarks
the
poet
from
angouleme
found
the
first
person
with
whom
he
could
chat
the
stranger
name
was
etienne
lousteau
two
years
ago
he
had
left
his
native
place
a
town
in
berri
just
as
lucien
had
come
from
angouleme
his
lively
gestures
bright
eyes
and
occasionally
curt
speech
revealed
a
bitter
apprenticeship
to
literature
etienne
had
come
from
sancerre
with
his
tragedy
in
his
pocket
drawn
to
paris
by
the
same
motives
that
impelled
lucien
hope
of
fame
and
power
and
money
sometimes
etienne
lousteau
came
for
several
days
together
but
in
a
little
while
his
visits
became
few
and
far
between
and
he
would
stay
away
for
five
or
six
days
in
succession
then
he
would
come
back
and
lucien
would
hope
to
see
his
poet
next
day
only
to
find
a
stranger
in
his
place
when
two
young
men
meet
daily
their
talk
harks
back
to
their
last
conversation
but
these
continual
interruptions
obliged
lucien
to
break
the
ice
afresh
each
time
and
further
checked
an
intimacy
which
made
little
progress
during
the
first
few
weeks
on
inquiry
of
the
damsel
at
the
counter
lucien
was
told
that
his
future
friend
was
on
the
staff
of
a
small
newspaper
and
wrote
reviews
of
books
and
dramatic
criticism
of
pieces
played
at
the
the
gaite
and
the
the
young
man
became
a
personage
all
at
once
in
lucien
eyes
now
he
thought
he
would
lead
the
conversation
on
rather
more
personal
topics
and
make
some
effort
to
gain
a
friend
so
likely
to
be
useful
to
a
beginner
the
journalist
stayed
away
for
a
fortnight
lucien
did
not
know
that
etienne
only
dined
at
flicoteaux
when
he
was
hard
up
and
hence
his
gloomy
air
of
disenchantment
and
the
chilly
manner
which
lucien
met
with
gracious
smiles
and
amiable
remarks
but
after
all
the
project
of
a
friendship
called
for
mature
deliberation
this
obscure
journalist
appeared
to
lead
an
expensive
life
in
which
cups
of
coffee
and
suppers
played
a
part
in
the
early
days
of
lucien
life
in
the
latin
quarter
he
behaved
like
a
poor
child
bewildered
by
his
first
experience
of
paris
life
so
that
when
he
had
made
a
study
of
prices
and
weighed
his
purse
he
lacked
courage
to
make
advances
to
etienne
he
was
afraid
of
beginning
a
fresh
series
of
blunders
of
which
he
was
still
repenting
and
he
was
still
under
the
yoke
of
provincial
creeds
his
two
guardian
angels
eve
and
david
rose
up
before
him
at
the
least
approach
of
an
evil
thought
putting
him
in
mind
of
all
the
hopes
that
were
centered
on
him
of
the
happiness
that
he
owed
to
the
old
mother
of
all
the
promises
of
his
genius
he
spent
his
mornings
in
studying
history
at
the
bibliotheque
his
very
first
researches
made
him
aware
of
frightful
errors
in
the
memoirs
of
archer
of
charles
when
the
library
closed
he
went
back
to
his
damp
chilly
room
to
correct
his
work
cutting
out
whole
chapters
and
piecing
it
together
anew
and
after
dining
at
flicoteaux
he
went
down
to
the
passage
du
commerce
to
see
the
newspapers
at
blosse
as
well
as
new
books
and
magazines
and
poetry
so
as
to
keep
himself
informed
of
the
movements
of
the
day
and
when
towards
midnight
he
returned
to
his
wretched
lodgings
he
had
used
neither
fuel
nor
his
reading
in
those
days
made
such
an
enormous
change
in
his
ideas
that
he
revised
the
volume
of
his
beloved
working
them
over
to
such
purpose
that
scarce
a
hundred
lines
of
the
original
verses
were
allowed
to
stand
so
in
the
beginning
lucien
led
the
honest
innocent
life
of
the
country
lad
who
never
leaves
the
latin
quarter
devoting
himself
wholly
to
his
work
with
thoughts
of
the
future
always
before
him
who

after
the
simple
and
strolls
for
recreation
along
the
alleys
of
the
luxembourg
the
blood
surging
back
to
his
heart
as
he
gives
timid
side
glances
to
the
pretty
women
but
this
could
not
last
lucien
with
his
poetic
temperament
and
boundless
longings
could
not
withstand
the
temptations
held
out
by
the
the
the
vaudeville
the
varietes
the
relieved
him
of
some
sixty
francs
although
he
always
went
to
the
pit
what
student
could
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
seeing
talma
in
one
of
his
famous
roles
lucien
was
fascinated
by
the
theatre
that
first
love
of
all
poetic
temperaments
the
actors
and
actresses
were
creatures
he
did
not
so
much
as
dream
of
the
possibility
of
crossing
the
footlights
and
meeting
them
on
familiar
terms
the
men
and
women
who
gave
him
so
much
pleasure
were
surely
marvelous
beings
whom
the
newspapers
treated
with
as
much
gravity
as
matters
of
national
interest
to
be
a
dramatic
author
to
have
a
play
produced
on
the
stage
what
a
dream
was
this
to
cherish
a
dream
which
a
few
bold
spirits
like
casimir
delavigne
had
actually
realized
thick
swarming
thoughts
like
these
and
moments
of
belief
in
himself
followed
by
despair
gave
lucien
no
rest
and
kept
him
in
the
narrow
way
of
toil
and
frugality
in
spite
of
the
smothered
grumblings
of
more
than
one
frenzied
desire
carrying
prudence
to
an
extreme
he
made
it
a
rule
never
to
enter
the
precincts
of
the
palais
royal
that
place
of
perdition
where
he
had
spent
fifty
francs
at
very
in
a
single
day
and
nearly
five
hundred
francs
on
his
clothes
and
when
he
yielded
to
temptation
and
saw
fleury
talma
the
two
baptistes
or
michot
he
went
no
further
than
the
murky
passage
where
used
to
stand
in
a
string
from
five
in
the
afternoon
till
the
hour
when
the
doors
opened
and
belated
comers
were
compelled
to
pay
ten
sous
for
a
place
near
the
and
after
waiting
for
two
hours
the
cry
of
all
tickets
are
sold
rang
not
unfrequently
in
the
ears
of
disappointed
students
when
the
play
was
over
lucien
went
home
with
downcast
eyes
through
streets
lined
with
living
attractions
and
perhaps
fell
in
with
one
of
those
commonplace
adventures
which
loom
so
large
in
a
young
and
timorous
imagination
one
day
lucien
counted
over
his
remaining
stock
of
money
and
took
alarm
at
the
melting
of
his
funds
a
cold
perspiration
broke
out
upon
him
when
he
thought
that
the
time
had
come
when
he
must
find
a
publisher
and
try
also
to
find
work
for
which
a
publisher
would
pay
him
the
young
journalist
with
whom
he
had
made
a
friendship
never
came
now
to
flicoteaux
lucien
was
waiting
for
a
chance
which
failed
to
present
itself
in
paris
there
are
no
chances
except
for
men
with
a
very
wide
circle
of
acquaintance
chances
of
success
of
every
kind
increase
with
the
number
of
your
connections
and
therefore
in
this
sense
also
the
chances
are
in
favor
of
the
big
battalions
lucien
had
sufficient
provincial
foresight
still
left
and
had
no
mind
to
wait
until
only
a
last
few
coins
remained
to
him
he
resolved
to
face
the
publishers
so
one
tolerably
chilly
september
morning
lucien
went
down
the
rue
de
la
harpe
with
his
two
manuscripts
under
his
arm
as
he
made
his
way
to
the
quai
des
augustins
and
went
along
looking
into
the
booksellers
windows
on
one
side
and
into
the
seine
on
the
other
his
good
genius
might
have
counseled
him
to
pitch
himself
into
the
water
sooner
than
plunge
into
literature
after
hesitations
after
a
profound
scrutiny
of
the
various
countenances
more
or
less
encouraging
churlish
cheerful
or
melancholy
to
be
seen
through
the
window
panes
or
in
the
doorways
of
the
establishments
he
espied
a
house
where
the
shopmen
were
busy
packing
books
at
a
great
rate
goods
were
being
despatched
the
walls
were
plastered
with
bills
just
out

are
lucky
that

exclaimed
lucien
the
placard
a
new
and
original
idea
of
the
celebrated
ladvocat
was
just
beginning
to
blossom
out
upon
the
walls
in
no
long
space
paris
was
to
wear
motley
thanks
to
the
exertions
of
his
imitators
and
the
treasury
was
to
discover
a
new
source
of
revenue
anxiety
sent
the
blood
surging
to
lucien
heart
as
he
who
had
been
so
great
at
angouleme
so
insignificant
of
late
in
paris
slipped
past
the
other
houses
summoned
up
all
his
courage
and
at
last
entered
the
shop
thronged
with
assistants
customers
and
booksellers
and
authors
too
perhaps
thought
lucien
i
want
to
speak
with
vidal
or
porchon
he
said
addressing
a
shopman
he
had
read
the
names
on
the
vidal
porchon
it
ran
and
foreign
booksellers
both
gentlemen
are
engaged
said
the
man
i
will
wait
left
to
himself
the
poet
scrutinized
the
packages
and
amused
himself
for
a
couple
of
hours
by
scanning
the
titles
of
books
looking
into
them
and
reading
a
page
or
two
here
and
there
at
last
as
he
stood
leaning
against
a
window
he
heard
voices
and
suspecting
that
the
green
curtains
hid
either
vidal
or
porchon
he
listened
to
the
conversation
will
you
take
five
hundred
copies
of
me
if
you
will
i
will
let
you
have
them
at
five
francs
and
give
fourteen
to
the
dozen

does
that
bring
them
in
at
sixteen

less

said
vidal

whichever
it
was
yes
said
the
vendor

inquired
the
purchaser
old
humbug
you
would
settle
with
me
in
eighteen
months
time
with
bills
at
a
twelvemonth
no
settled
at
once
returned
vidal
or
porchon
bills
at
nine
months
asked
the
publisher
or
author
who
evidently
was
selling
his
book
no
my
dear
fellow
twelve
months
returned
one
of
the
firm
of
booksellers
agents
there
was
a
pause
you
are
simply
cutting
my
throat
said
the
visitor
but
in
a
year
time
shall
we
have
placed
a
hundred
copies
of
said
the
other
voice
if
books
went
off
as
fast
as
the
publishers
would
like
we
should
be
millionaires
my
good
sir
but
they
do
they
go
as
the
public
pleases
there
is
some
one
now
bringing
out
an
edition
of
scott
novels
at
eighteen
sous
per

three
livres
twelve
sous
per

and
you
want
me
to
give
you
more
for
your
stale
remainders
no
if
you
mean
me
to
push
this
novel
of
yours
you
must
make
it
worth
my
vidal
a
stout
man
with
a
pen
behind
his
ear
came
down
from
his
desk
how
many
copies
of
ducange
did
you
place
last
journey
asked
porchon
of
his
partner
two
hundred
of
petit
vieillard
de
but
to
sell
them
i
was
obliged
to
cry
down
two
books
which
pay
in
less
commission
and
uncommonly
fine
they
are
now
a
nightingale
as
lucien
afterwards
learned
is
a
bookseller
name
for
books
that
linger
on
hand
perched
out
of
sight
in
the
loneliest
nooks
in
the
shop
and
besides
added
vidal
picard
is
bringing
out
some
novels
as
you
know
we
have
been
promised
twenty
per
cent
on
the
published
price
to
make
the
thing
a
success
very
well
at
twelve
months
the
publisher
answered
in
a
piteous
voice
thunderstruck
by
vidal
confidential
remark
is
it
an
offer
porchon
inquired
curtly
yes
the
stranger
went
out
after
he
had
gone
lucien
heard
porchon
say
to
vidal
we
have
three
hundred
copies
on
order
now
we
will
keep
him
waiting
for
his
settlement
sell
the
for
five
francs
net
settlement
in
six
months
and
and
that
will
be
fifteen
hundred
francs
into
our
pockets
said
vidal
oh
i
saw
quite
well
that
he
was
in
a
fix
he
is
giving
ducange
four
thousand
francs
for
two
thousand
copies
lucien
cut
vidal
short
by
appearing
in
the
entrance
of
the
den
i
have
the
honor
of
wishing
you
a
good
day
gentlemen
he
said
addressing
both
partners
the
booksellers
nodded
slightly
i
have
a
french
historical
romance
after
the
style
of
scott
it
is
called
archer
of
charles
i
propose
to
offer
it
to
you
porchon
glanced
at
lucien
with
lustreless
eyes
and
laid
his
pen
down
on
the
desk
vidal
stared
rudely
at
the
author
we
are
not
publishing
booksellers
sir
we
are
booksellers
agents
he
said
when
we
bring
out
a
book
ourselves
we
only
deal
in
names
and
we
only
take
serious
literature
besides
history
and
epitomes
but
my
book
is
very
serious
it
is
an
attempt
to
set
the
struggle
between
catholics
and
calvinists
in
its
true
light
the
catholics
were
supporters
of
absolute
monarchy
and
the
protestants
for
a
republic
m
vidal
shouted
an
assistant
vidal
fled
i
do
say
sir
that
your
book
is
not
a
masterpiece
replied
porchon
with
scanty
civility
but
we
only
deal
in
books
that
are
ready
printed
go
and
see
somebody
that
buys
manuscripts
there
is
old
doguereau
in
the
rue
du
coq
near
the
louvre
he
is
in
the
romance
line
if
you
had
only
spoken
sooner
you
might
have
seen
pollet
a
competitor
of
doguereau
and
of
the
publisher
in
the
wooden
galleries
i
have
a
volume
of
poetry
m
porchon
somebody
shouted
porchon
exclaimed
angrily
for
what
do
you
take
me
he
added
laughing
in
lucien
face
and
he
dived
into
the
regions
of
the
back
shop
lucien
went
back
across
the
pont
neuf
absorbed
in
reflection
from
all
that
he
understood
of
this
mercantile
dialect
it
appeared
that
books
like
cotton
nightcaps
were
to
be
regarded
as
articles
of
merchandise
to
be
sold
dear
and
bought
cheap
i
have
made
a
mistake
said
lucien
to
himself
but
all
the
same
this
practical
aspect
of
literature
made
an
impression
upon
him
in
the
rue
du
coq
he
stopped
in
front
of
a
shop
which
he
had
passed
before
he
saw
the
inscription
doguereau
bookseller
painted
above
it
in
yellow
letters
on
a
green
ground
and
remembered
that
he
had
seen
the
name
at
the
foot
of
the
of
several
novels
at
blosse
in
he
went
not
without
the
inward
trepidation
which
a
man
of
any
imagination
feels
at
the
prospect
of
a
battle
inside
the
shop
he
discovered
an
old
man
one
of
the
queer
characters
of
the
trade
in
the
days
of
the
empire
doguereau
wore
a
black
coat
with
vast
square
skirts
when
fashion
required
coats
his
waistcoat
was
of
some
cheap
material
a
checked
pattern
of
many
colors
a
steel
chain
with
a
copper
key
attached
to
it
hung
from
his
fob
and
dangled
down
over
a
roomy
pair
of
black
nether
garments
the
booksellers
watch
must
have
been
the
size
of
an
onion
ribbed
stockings
and
shoes
with
silver
buckles
completed
is
costume
the
old
man
head
was
bare
and
ornamented
with
a
fringe
of
grizzled
locks
quite
poetically
scanty
old
doguereau
as
porchon
styled
him
was
dressed
half
like
a
professor
of
as
to
his
trousers
and
shoes
half
like
a
tradesman
with
respect
to
the
variegated
waistcoat
the
stockings
and
the
watch
and
the
same
odd
mixture
appeared
in
the
man
himself
he
united
the
magisterial
dogmatic
air
and
the
hollow
countenance
of
the
professor
of
rhetoric
with
the
sharp
eyes
suspicious
mouth
and
vague
uneasiness
of
the
bookseller
m
doguereau
asked
lucien
that
is
my
name
sir
you
are
very
young
remarked
the
bookseller
my
age
sir
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
true
and
the
old
bookseller
took
up
the
manuscript
ah
begad
archer
of
charles
a
good
title
let
us
see
now
young
man
just
tell
me
your
subject
in
a
word
or
two
it
is
a
historical
work
sir
in
the
style
of
scott
the
character
of
the
struggle
between
the
protestants
and
catholics
is
depicted
as
a
struggle
between
two
opposed
systems
of
government
in
which
the
throne
is
seriously
endangered
i
have
taken
the
catholic
side
eh
but
you
have
ideas
young
man
very
well
i
will
read
your
book
i
promise
you
i
would
rather
have
had
something
more
in
radcliffe
style
but
if
you
are
industrious
if
you
have
some
notion
of
style
conceptions
ideas
and
the
art
of
telling
a
story
i
ask
better
than
to
be
of
use
to
you
what
do
we
want
but
good
manuscripts
when
can
i
come
back
i
am
going
into
the
country
this
evening
i
shall
be
back
again
the
day
after
i
shall
have
read
your
manuscript
by
that
time
and
if
it
suits
me
we
might
come
to
terms
that
very
day
seeing
his
acquaintance
so
easy
lucien
was
inspired
with
the
unlucky
idea
of
bringing
the
upon
the
scene
i
have
a
volume
of
poetry
as
well
sir
he
began
oh
you
are
a
poet
then
i
do
want
your
romance
and
the
old
man
handed
back
the
manuscript
the
rhyming
fellows
come
to
grief
when
they
try
their
hands
at
prose
in
prose
you
ca
use
words
that
mean
nothing
you
absolutely
must
say
something
but
sir
walter
scott
sir
wrote
poetry
as
well
as
that
is
true
said
doguereau
relenting
he
guessed
that
the
young
fellow
before
him
was
poor
and
kept
the
manuscript
where
do
you
live
i
will
come
and
see
you
lucien
all
unsuspicious
of
the
idea
at
the
back
of
the
old
head
gave
his
address
he
did
not
see
that
he
had
to
do
with
a
bookseller
of
the
old
school
a
survival
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
booksellers
tried
to
keep
voltaires
and
montesquieus
starving
in
garrets
under
lock
and
key
the
latin
quarter
i
am
coming
back
that
very
way
said
doguereau
when
he
had
read
the
address
good
man
thought
lucien
as
he
took
his
leave
so
i
have
met
with
a
friend
to
young
authors
a
man
of
taste
who
knows
something
that
is
the
kind
of
man
for
me
it
is
just
as
i
said
to
david
talent
soon
makes
its
way
in
paris
lucien
went
home
again
happy
and
light
of
heart
he
dreamed
of
glory
he
gave
not
another
thought
to
the
ominous
words
which
fell
on
his
ear
as
he
stood
by
the
counter
in
vidal
and
porchon
shop
he
beheld
himself
the
richer
by
twelve
hundred
francs
at
least
twelve
hundred
francs
it
meant
a
year
in
paris
a
whole
year
of
preparation
for
the
work
that
he
meant
to
do
what
plans
he
built
on
that
hope
what
sweet
dreams
what
visions
of
a
life
established
on
a
basis
of
work
mentally
he
found
new
quarters
and
settled
himself
in
them
it
would
not
have
taken
much
to
set
him
making
a
purchase
or
two
he
could
only
stave
off
impatience
by
constant
reading
at
blosse
two
days
later
old
doguereau
come
to
the
lodgings
of
his
budding
sir
walter
scott
he
was
struck
with
the
pains
which
lucien
had
taken
with
the
style
of
this
his
first
work
delighted
with
the
strong
contrasts
of
character
sanctioned
by
the
epoch
and
surprised
at
the
spirited
imagination
which
a
young
writer
always
displays
in
the
scheming
of
a
first
plot
he
had
not
been
spoiled
thought
old
daddy
doguereau
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
give
a
thousand
francs
for
archer
of
charles
he
would
buy
the
copyright
out
and
out
and
bind
lucien
by
an
engagement
for
several
books
but
when
he
came
to
look
at
the
house
the
old
fox
thought
better
of
it
a
young
fellow
that
lives
here
has
none
but
simple
tastes
said
he
to
himself
he
is
fond
of
study
fond
of
work
i
need
not
give
more
than
eight
hundred
francs
fourth
floor
answered
the
landlady
when
he
asked
for
lucien
de
rubempre
the
old
bookseller
peering
up
saw
nothing
but
the
sky
above
the
fourth
floor
this
young
fellow
thought
he
is
a
lad
one
might
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
is
very
handsome
if
he
were
to
make
too
much
money
he
would
only
fall
into
dissipated
ways
and
then
he
would
not
work
in
the
interests
of
us
both
i
shall
only
offer
six
hundred
francs
in
coin
though
not
paper
he
climbed
the
stairs
and
gave
three
raps
at
the
door
lucien
came
to
open
it
the
room
was
forlorn
in
its
bareness
a
bowl
of
milk
and
a
penny
roll
stood
on
the
table
the
destitution
of
genius
made
an
impression
on
daddy
doguereau
let
him
preserve
these
simple
habits
of
life
this
frugality
these
modest
requirements
thought
aloud
he
said
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
to
see
you
thus
sir
lived
whom
you
resemble
in
more
ways
than
one
amid
such
surroundings
the
fire
of
genius
shines
brightly
good
work
is
done
in
such
rooms
as
these
this
is
how
men
of
letters
should
work
instead
of
living
riotously
in
cafes
and
restaurants
wasting
their
time
and
talent
and
our
money
he
sat
down
your
romance
is
not
bad
young
man
i
was
a
professor
of
rhetoric
once
i
know
french
history
there
are
some
capital
things
in
it
you
have
a
future
before
you
in
fact
oh
sir
no
i
tell
you
so
we
may
do
business
together
i
will
buy
your
romance
lucien
heart
swelled
and
throbbed
with
gladness
he
was
about
to
enter
the
world
of
literature
he
should
see
himself
in
print
at
last
i
will
give
you
four
hundred
francs
continued
doguereau
in
honeyed
accents
and
he
looked
at
lucien
with
an
air
which
seemed
to
betoken
an
effort
of
generosity
the
volume
queried
lucien
for
the
romance
said
doguereau
heedless
of
lucien
surprise
in
ready
money
he
added
and
you
shall
undertake
to
write
two
books
for
me
every
year
for
six
years
if
the
first
book
is
out
of
print
in
six
months
i
will
give
you
six
hundred
francs
for
the
others
so
if
you
write
two
books
each
year
you
will
be
making
a
hundred
francs
a
month
you
will
have
a
sure
income
you
will
be
well
off
there
are
some
authors
whom
i
only
pay
three
hundred
francs
for
a
romance
i
give
two
hundred
for
translations
of
english
books
such
prices
would
have
been
exorbitant
in
the
old
days
sir
we
can
not
possibly
come
to
an
understanding
give
me
back
my
manuscript
i
beg
said
lucien
in
a
cold
chill
here
it
is
said
the
old
bookseller
you
know
nothing
of
business
sir
before
an
author
first
book
can
appear
a
publisher
is
bound
to
sink
sixteen
hundred
francs
on
the
paper
and
the
printing
of
it
it
is
easier
to
write
a
romance
than
to
find
all
that
money
i
have
a
hundred
romances
in
manuscript
and
i
have
not
a
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
francs
in
my
cash
box
alas
i
have
not
made
so
much
in
all
these
twenty
years
that
i
have
been
a
bookseller
so
you
do
make
a
fortune
by
printing
romances
you
see
vidal
and
porchon
only
take
them
of
us
on
conditions
that
grow
harder
and
harder
day
by
day
you
have
only
your
time
to
lose
while
i
am
obliged
to
disburse
two
thousand
francs
if
we
fail
sua
fata
i
lose
two
thousand
francs
while
as
for
you
you
simply
hurl
an
ode
at
the
public
when
you
have
thought
over
this
that
i
have
the
honor
of
telling
you
you
will
come
back
to
will
come
back
to
he
asserted
authoritatively
by
way
of
reply
to
a
scornful
gesture
made
involuntarily
by
lucien
so
far
from
finding
a
publisher
obliging
enough
to
risk
two
thousand
francs
for
an
unknown
writer
you
will
not
find
a
publisher
clerk
that
will
trouble
himself
to
look
through
your
screed
now
that
i
have
read
it
i
can
point
out
a
good
many
slips
in
grammar
you
have
put
for
and
is
a
preposition
and
requires
an
object
lucien
appeared
to
be
humiliated
when
i
see
you
again
you
will
have
lost
a
hundred
francs
he
added
i
shall
only
give
a
hundred
crowns
with
that
he
rose
and
took
his
leave
on
the
threshold
he
said
if
you
had
not
something
in
you
and
a
future
before
you
if
i
did
not
take
an
interest
in
studious
youth
i
should
not
have
made
you
such
a
handsome
offer
a
hundred
francs
per
month
think
of
it
after
all
a
romance
in
a
drawer
is
not
eating
its
head
off
like
a
horse
in
a
stable
nor
will
it
find
you
in
victuals
either
and
that
a
fact
lucien
snatched
up
his
manuscript
and
dashed
it
on
the
floor
i
would
rather
burn
it
sir
he
exclaimed
you
have
a
poet
head
returned
his
senior
lucien
devoured
his
bread
and
supped
his
bowl
of
milk
then
he
went
downstairs
his
room
was
not
large
enough
for
him
he
was
turning
round
and
round
in
it
like
a
lion
in
a
cage
at
the
jardin
des
plantes
at
the
bibliotheque
whither
lucien
was
going
he
had
come
to
know
a
stranger
by
sight
a
young
man
of
or
thereabouts
working
with
the
sustained
industry
which
nothing
can
disturb
nor
distract
the
sign
by
which
your
genuine
literary
worker
is
known
evidently
the
young
man
had
been
reading
there
for
some
time
for
the
librarian
and
attendants
all
knew
him
and
paid
him
special
attention
the
librarian
would
even
allow
him
to
take
away
books
with
which
lucien
saw
him
return
in
the
morning
in
the
stranger
student
he
recognized
a
brother
in
penury
and
hope
and
slight
and
thin
with
a
fine
forehead
hidden
by
masses
of
black
tolerably
unkempt
hair
there
was
something
about
him
that
attracted
indifferent
eyes
it
was
a
vague
resemblance
which
he
bore
to
portraits
of
the
young
bonaparte
engraved
from
robert
picture
that
engraving
is
a
poem
of
melancholy
intensity
of
suppressed
ambition
of
power
working
below
the
surface
study
the
face
carefully
and
you
will
discover
genius
in
it
and
discretion
and
all
the
subtlety
and
greatness
of
the
man
the
portrait
has
speaking
eyes
like
a
woman
they
look
out
greedy
of
space
craving
difficulties
to
vanquish
even
if
the
name
of
bonaparte
were
not
written
beneath
it
you
would
gaze
long
at
that
face
lucien
young
student
the
incarnation
of
this
picture
usually
wore
footed
trousers
shoes
with
thick
soles
to
them
an
overcoat
of
coarse
cloth
a
black
cravat
a
waistcoat
of
some
material
buttoned
to
the
chin
and
a
cheap
hat
contempt
for
superfluity
in
dress
was
visible
in
his
whole
person
lucien
also
discovered
that
the
mysterious
stranger
with
that
unmistakable
stamp
which
genius
sets
upon
the
forehead
of
its
slaves
was
one
of
flicoteaux
most
regular
customers
he
ate
to
live
careless
of
the
fare
which
appeared
to
be
familiar
to
him
and
drank
water
wherever
lucien
saw
him
at
the
library
or
at
flicoteaux
there
was
a
dignity
in
his
manner
springing
doubtless
from
the
consciousness
of
a
purpose
that
filled
his
life
a
dignity
which
made
him
unapproachable
he
had
the
expression
of
a
thinker
meditation
dwelt
on
the
fine
nobly
carved
brow
you
could
tell
from
the
dark
bright
eyes
so
and
quick
to
observe
that
their
owner
was
wont
to
probe
to
the
bottom
of
things
he
gesticulated
very
little
his
demeanor
was
grave
lucien
felt
an
involuntary
respect
for
him
many
times
already
the
pair
had
looked
at
each
other
at
the
bibliotheque
or
at
flicoteaux
many
times
they
had
been
on
the
point
of
speaking
but
neither
of
them
had
ventured
so
far
as
yet
the
silent
young
man
went
off
to
the
further
end
of
the
library
on
the
side
at
right
angles
to
the
place
de
la
sorbonne
and
lucien
had
no
opportunity
of
making
his
acquaintance
although
he
felt
drawn
to
a
worker
whom
he
knew
by
indescribable
tokens
for
a
character
of
no
common
order
both
as
they
came
to
know
afterwards
were
unsophisticated
and
shy
given
to
fears
which
cause
a
pleasurable
emotion
to
solitary
creatures
perhaps
they
never
would
have
been
brought
into
communication
if
they
had
not
come
across
each
other
that
day
of
lucien
disaster
for
as
lucien
turned
into
the
rue
des
gres
he
saw
the
student
coming
away
from
the
bibliotheque
the
library
is
closed
i
do
know
why
monsieur
said
he
tears
were
standing
in
lucien
eyes
he
expressed
his
thanks
by
one
of
those
gestures
that
speak
more
eloquently
than
words
and
unlock
hearts
at
once
when
two
men
meet
in
youth
they
went
together
along
the
rue
des
gres
towards
the
rue
de
la
harpe
as
that
is
so
i
shall
go
to
the
luxembourg
for
a
walk
said
lucien
when
you
have
come
out
it
is
not
easy
to
settle
down
to
work
again
no
one
ideas
will
not
flow
in
the
proper
current
remarked
the
stranger
something
seems
to
have
annoyed
you
monsieur
i
have
just
had
a
queer
adventure
said
lucien
and
he
told
the
history
of
his
visit
to
the
quai
and
gave
an
account
of
his
subsequent
dealings
with
the
old
bookseller
he
gave
his
name
and
said
a
word
or
two
of
his
position
in
one
month
or
thereabouts
he
had
spent
sixty
francs
on
his
board
thirty
for
lodging
twenty
more
francs
in
going
to
the
theatre
and
ten
at
blosse
reading
room
one
hundred
and
twenty
francs
in
all
and
now
he
had
just
a
hundred
and
twenty
francs
in
hand
your
story
is
mine
monsieur
and
the
story
of
ten
or
twelve
hundred
young
fellows
besides
who
come
from
the
country
to
paris
every
year
there
are
others
even
worse
off
than
we
are
do
you
see
that
theatre
he
continued
indicating
the
turrets
of
the
odeon
there
came
one
day
to
lodge
in
one
of
the
houses
in
the
square
a
man
of
talent
who
had
fallen
into
the
lowest
depths
of
poverty
he
was
married
in
addition
to
the
misfortunes
which
we
share
with
him
to
a
wife
whom
he
loved
and
the
poorer
or
the
richer
as
you
will
by
two
children
he
was
burdened
with
debt
but
he
put
his
faith
in
his
pen
he
took
a
comedy
in
five
acts
to
the
odeon
the
comedy
was
accepted
the
management
arranged
to
bring
it
out
the
actors
learned
their
parts
the
stage
manager
urged
on
the
rehearsals
five
several
bits
of
luck
five
dramas
to
be
performed
in
real
life
and
far
harder
tasks
than
the
writing
of
a
play
the
poor
author
lodged
in
a
garret
you
can
see
the
place
from
here
he
drained
his
last
resources
to
live
until
the
first
representation
his
wife
pawned
her
clothes
they
all
lived
on
dry
bread
on
the
day
of
the
final
rehearsal
the
household
owed
fifty
francs
in
the
quarter
to
the
baker
the
milkwoman
and
the
porter
the
author
had
only
the
strictly
necessary
clothes
a
coat
a
shirt
trousers
a
waistcoat
and
a
pair
of
boots
he
felt
sure
of
his
success
he
kissed
his
wife
the
end
of
their
troubles
was
at
hand
last
there
is
nothing
against
us
now
cried
there
is
fire
said
his
wife
the
odeon
is
on
fire
the
odeon
was
on
fire
monsieur
so
do
not
you
complain
you
have
clothes
you
have
neither
wife
nor
child
you
have
a
hundred
and
twenty
francs
for
emergencies
in
your
pocket
and
you
owe
no
one
a
well
the
piece
went
through
a
hundred
and
fifty
representations
at
the
theatre
louvois
the
king
allowed
the
author
a
pension
is
patience
as
buffon
said
and
patience
after
all
is
a
man
nearest
approach
to
nature
processes
of
creation
what
is
art
monsieur
but
nature
concentrated
by
this
time
the
young
men
were
striding
along
the
walks
of
the
luxembourg
and
in
no
long
time
lucien
learned
the
name
of
the
stranger
who
was
doing
his
best
to
administer
comfort
that
name
has
since
grown
famous
daniel
is
one
of
the
most
illustrious
of
living
men
of
letters
one
of
the
rare
few
who
show
us
an
example
of
a
noble
gift
with
a
noble
nature
combined
to
quote
a
poet
fine
thought
there
is
no
cheap
route
to
greatness
daniel
went
on
in
his
kind
voice
the
works
of
genius
are
watered
with
tears
the
gift
that
is
in
you
like
an
existence
in
the
physical
world
passes
through
childhood
and
its
maladies
nature
sweeps
away
sickly
or
deformed
creatures
and
society
rejects
an
imperfectly
developed
talent
any
man
who
means
to
rise
above
the
rest
must
make
ready
for
a
struggle
and
be
undaunted
by
difficulties
a
great
writer
is
a
martyr
who
does
not
die
that
is
there
is
the
stamp
of
genius
on
your
forehead
continued
enveloping
lucien
by
a
glance
but
unless
you
have
within
you
the
will
of
genius
unless
you
are
gifted
with
angelic
patience
unless
no
matter
how
far
the
freaks
of
fate
have
set
you
from
your
destined
goal
you
can
find
the
way
to
your
infinite
as
the
turtles
in
the
indies
find
their
way
to
the
ocean
you
had
better
give
up
at
once
then
do
you
yourself
expect
these
ordeals
asked
lucien
trials
of
every
kind
slander
and
treachery
and
effrontery
and
cunning
the
rivals
who
act
unfairly
and
the
keen
competition
of
the
literary
market
his
companion
said
resignedly
what
is
a
first
loss
if
only
your
work
was
good
will
you
look
at
mine
and
give
me
your
opinion
asked
lucien
so
be
it
said
i
am
living
in
the
rue
des
desplein
one
of
the
most
illustrious
men
of
genius
in
our
time
the
greatest
surgeon
that
the
world
has
known
once
endured
the
martyrdom
of
early
struggles
with
the
first
difficulties
of
a
glorious
career
in
the
same
house
i
think
of
that
every
night
and
the
thought
gives
me
the
stock
of
courage
that
i
need
every
morning
i
am
living
in
the
very
room
where
like
rousseau
he
had
no
theresa
come
in
an
time
i
shall
be
in
the
poets
grasped
each
other
hands
with
a
rush
of
melancholy
and
tender
feeling
inexpressible
in
words
and
went
their
separate
ways
lucien
to
fetch
his
manuscript
daniel
to
pawn
his
watch
and
buy
a
couple
of
faggots
the
weather
was
cold
and
his
friend
should
find
a
fire
in
his
room
lucien
was
punctual
he
noticed
at
once
that
the
house
was
of
an
even
poorer
class
than
the
hotel
de
cluny
a
staircase
gradually
became
visible
at
the
further
end
of
a
dark
passage
he
mounted
to
the
fifth
floor
and
found
room
a
bookcase
of
wood
with
rows
of
labeled
cardboard
cases
on
the
shelves
stood
between
the
two
crazy
windows
a
gaunt
painted
wooden
bedstead
of
the
kind
seen
in
school
dormitories
a
picked
up
cheaply
somewhere
and
a
couple
of
horsehair
armchairs
filled
the
further
end
of
the
room
the
a
highland
plaid
pattern
was
glazed
over
with
the
grime
of
years
between
the
window
and
the
grate
stood
a
long
table
littered
with
papers
and
opposite
the
fireplace
there
was
a
cheap
mahogany
chest
of
drawers
a
carpet
covered
the
floor
a
necessary
luxury
for
it
saved
firing
a
common
office
armchair
cushioned
with
leather
crimson
once
but
now
hoary
with
wear
was
drawn
up
to
the
table
add
rickety
chairs
and
you
have
a
complete
list
of
the
furniture
lucien
noticed
an
for
a
with
an
adjustable
screen
attached
and
wondered
to
see
four
wax
candles
in
the
sockets
explained
that
he
could
not
endure
the
smell
of
tallow
a
little
trait
denoting
great
delicacy
of
sense
perception
and
the
exquisite
sensibility
which
accompanies
it
the
reading
lasted
for
seven
hours
daniel
listened
conscientiously
forbearing
to
interrupt
by
word
or
comment
one
of
the
rarest
proofs
of
good
taste
in
a
listener
well
queried
lucien
laying
the
manuscript
on
the
you
have
made
a
good
start
on
the
right
way
answered
judicially
but
you
must
go
over
your
work
again
you
must
strike
out
a
different
style
for
yourself
if
you
do
not
mean
to
ape
sir
walter
scott
for
you
have
taken
him
for
your
model
you
begin
for
instance
as
he
begins
with
long
conversations
to
introduce
your
characters
and
only
when
they
have
said
their
say
does
description
and
action
follow
this
opposition
necessary
in
all
work
of
a
dramatic
kind
comes
last
just
put
the
terms
of
the
problem
the
other
way
round
give
descriptions
to
which
our
language
lends
itself
so
admirably
instead
of
diffuse
dialogue
magnificent
in
scott
work
but
colorless
in
your
own
lead
naturally
up
to
your
dialogue
plunge
straight
into
the
action
treat
your
subject
from
different
points
of
view
sometimes
in
a
sometimes
retrospectively
vary
your
methods
in
fact
to
diversify
your
work
you
may
be
original
while
adapting
the
scots
novelist
form
of
dramatic
dialogue
to
french
history
there
is
no
passion
in
scott
novels
he
ignores
passion
or
perhaps
it
was
interdicted
by
the
hypocritical
manners
of
his
country
woman
for
him
is
duty
incarnate
his
heroines
with
possibly
one
or
two
exceptions
are
all
alike
he
has
drawn
them
all
from
the
same
model
as
painters
say
they
are
every
one
of
them
descended
from
clarissa
harlowe
and
returning
continually
as
he
did
to
the
same
idea
of
woman
how
could
he
do
otherwise
than
produce
a
single
type
varied
only
by
degrees
of
vividness
in
the
coloring
woman
brings
confusion
into
society
through
passion
passion
gives
infinite
possibilities
therefore
depict
passion
you
have
one
great
resource
open
to
you
foregone
by
the
great
genius
for
the
sake
of
providing
family
reading
for
prudish
england
in
france
you
have
the
charming
sinner
the
life
of
catholicism
contrasted
with
sombre
calvinistic
figures
on
a
background
of
the
times
when
passions
ran
higher
than
at
any
other
period
of
our
history
every
epoch
which
has
left
authentic
records
since
the
time
of
charles
the
great
calls
for
at
least
one
romance
some
require
four
or
five
the
periods
of
louis
of
henry
of
francis
for
instance
you
would
give
us
in
this
way
a
picturesque
history
of
france
with
the
costumes
and
furniture
the
houses
and
their
interiors
and
domestic
life
giving
us
the
spirit
of
the
time
instead
of
a
laborious
narration
of
ascertained
facts
then
there
is
further
scope
for
originality
you
can
remove
some
of
the
popular
delusions
which
disfigure
the
memories
of
most
of
our
kings
be
bold
enough
in
this
first
work
of
yours
to
rehabilitate
the
great
magnificent
figure
of
catherine
whom
you
have
sacrificed
to
the
prejudices
which
still
cloud
her
name
and
finally
paint
charles
ix
for
us
as
he
really
was
and
not
as
protestant
writers
have
made
him
ten
years
of
persistent
work
and
fame
and
fortune
will
be
yours
by
this
time
it
was
nine
lucien
followed
the
example
set
in
secret
by
his
future
friend
by
asking
him
to
dine
at
eldon
and
spent
twelve
francs
at
that
restaurant
during
the
dinner
daniel
admitted
lucien
into
the
secret
of
his
hopes
and
studies
daniel
would
not
allow
that
any
writer
could
attain
to
a
rank
without
a
profound
knowledge
of
metaphysics
he
was
engaged
in
ransacking
the
spoils
of
ancient
and
modern
philosophy
and
in
the
assimilation
of
it
all
he
would
be
like
moliere
a
profound
philosopher
first
and
a
writer
of
comedies
afterwards
he
was
studying
the
world
of
books
and
the
living
world
about
him
thought
and
fact
his
friends
were
learned
naturalists
young
doctors
of
medicine
political
writers
and
artists
a
number
of
earnest
students
full
of
promise
earned
a
living
by
conscientious
and
work
he
wrote
articles
for
encyclopaedias
dictionaries
of
biography
and
natural
science
doing
just
enough
to
enable
him
to
live
while
he
followed
his
own
bent
and
neither
more
nor
less
he
had
a
piece
of
imaginative
work
on
hand
undertaken
solely
for
the
sake
of
studying
the
resources
of
language
an
important
psychological
study
in
the
form
of
a
novel
unfinished
as
yet
for
took
it
up
or
laid
it
down
as
the
humor
took
him
and
kept
it
for
days
of
great
distress
revelations
of
himself
were
made
very
simply
but
to
lucien
he
seemed
like
an
intellectual
giant
and
by
eleven
when
they
left
the
restaurant
he
began
to
feel
a
sudden
warm
friendship
for
this
nature
unconscious
of
its
loftiness
this
unostentatious
worth
lucien
took
advice
unquestioningly
and
followed
it
out
to
the
letter
the
most
magnificent
palaces
of
fancy
had
been
suddenly
flung
open
to
him
by
a
mind
matured
already
by
thought
and
critical
examinations
undertaken
for
their
own
sake
not
for
publication
but
for
the
solitary
thinker
own
satisfaction
the
burning
coal
had
been
laid
on
the
lips
of
the
poet
of
angouleme
a
word
uttered
by
a
hard
student
in
paris
had
fallen
upon
ground
prepared
to
receive
it
in
the
provincial
lucien
set
about
recasting
his
work
in
his
gladness
at
finding
in
the
wilderness
of
paris
a
nature
abounding
in
generous
and
sympathetic
feeling
the
distinguished
provincial
did
as
all
young
creatures
hungering
for
affection
are
wont
to
do
he
fastened
like
a
chronic
disease
upon
this
one
friend
that
he
had
found
he
called
for
on
his
way
to
the
bibliotheque
walked
with
him
on
fine
days
in
the
luxembourg
gardens
and
went
with
his
friend
every
evening
as
far
as
the
door
of
his
after
sitting
next
to
him
at
flicoteaux
he
pressed
close
to
his
friend
side
as
a
soldier
might
keep
by
a
comrade
on
the
frozen
russian
plains
during
those
early
days
of
his
acquaintance
he
noticed
not
without
chagrin
that
his
presence
imposed
a
certain
restraint
on
the
circle
of
daniel
intimates
the
talk
of
those
superior
beings
of
whom
spoke
to
him
with
such
concentrated
enthusiasm
kept
within
the
bounds
of
a
reserve
but
little
in
keeping
with
the
evident
warmth
of
their
friendships
at
these
times
lucien
discreetly
took
his
leave
a
feeling
of
curiosity
mingling
with
the
sense
of
something
like
pain
at
the
ostracism
to
which
he
was
subjected
by
these
strangers
who
all
addressed
each
other
by
their
christian
names
each
one
of
them
like
bore
the
stamp
of
genius
upon
his
forehead
after
some
private
opposition
overcome
by
without
knowledge
the
newcomer
was
at
length
judged
worthy
to
make
one
of
the
of
lofty
thinkers
henceforward
he
was
to
be
one
of
a
little
group
of
young
men
who
met
almost
every
evening
in
room
united
by
the
keenest
sympathies
and
by
the
earnestness
of
their
intellectual
life
they
all
foresaw
a
great
writer
in
they
looked
upon
him
as
their
chief
since
the
loss
of
one
of
their
number
a
mystical
genius
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
intellects
of
the
age
this
former
leader
had
gone
back
to
his
province
for
reasons
on
which
it
serves
no
purpose
to
enter
but
lucien
often
heard
them
speak
of
this
absent
friend
as
louis
several
of
the
group
were
destined
to
fall
by
the
way
but
others
like
have
since
won
all
the
fame
that
was
their
due
a
few
details
as
to
the
circle
will
readily
explain
lucien
strong
feeling
of
interest
and
curiosity
one
among
those
who
still
survive
was
horace
bianchon
then
a
at
the
later
a
shining
light
at
the
ecole
de
paris
and
now
so
well
known
that
it
is
needless
to
give
any
description
of
his
appearance
genius
or
character
next
came
leon
giraud
that
profound
philosopher
and
bold
theorist
turning
all
systems
inside
out
criticising
expressing
and
formulating
dragging
them
all
to
the
feet
of
his
idol
humanity
great
even
in
his
errors
for
his
honesty
ennobled
his
mistakes
an
intrepid
toiler
a
conscientious
scholar
he
became
the
acknowledged
head
of
a
school
of
moralists
and
politicians
time
alone
can
pronounce
upon
the
merits
of
his
theories
but
if
his
convictions
have
drawn
him
into
paths
in
which
none
of
his
old
comrades
tread
none
the
less
he
is
still
their
faithful
friend
art
was
represented
by
joseph
bridau
one
of
the
best
painters
among
the
younger
men
but
for
a
too
impressionable
nature
which
made
havoc
of
joseph
heart
he
might
have
continued
the
traditions
of
the
great
italian
masters
though
for
that
matter
the
last
word
has
not
yet
been
said
concerning
him
he
combines
roman
outline
with
venetian
color
but
love
is
fatal
to
his
work
love
not
merely
transfixes
his
heart
but
sends
his
arrow
through
the
brain
deranges
the
course
of
his
life
and
sets
the
victim
describing
the
strangest
zigzags
if
the
mistress
of
the
moment
is
too
kind
or
too
cruel
joseph
will
send
into
the
exhibition
sketches
where
the
drawing
is
clogged
with
color
or
pictures
finished
under
the
stress
of
some
imaginary
woe
in
which
he
gave
his
whole
attention
to
the
drawing
and
left
the
color
to
take
care
of
itself
he
is
a
constant
disappointment
to
his
friends
and
the
public
yet
hoffmann
would
have
worshiped
him
for
his
daring
experiments
in
the
realms
of
art
when
bridau
is
wholly
himself
he
is
admirable
and
as
praise
is
sweet
to
him
his
disgust
is
great
when
one
praises
the
failures
in
which
he
alone
discovers
all
that
is
lacking
in
the
eyes
of
the
public
he
is
whimsical
to
the
last
degree
his
friends
have
seen
him
destroy
a
finished
picture
because
in
his
eyes
it
looked
too
smooth
it
is
overdone
he
would
say
it
is
niggling
work
with
his
eccentric
yet
lofty
nature
with
a
nervous
organization
and
all
that
it
entails
of
torment
and
delight
the
craving
for
perfection
becomes
morbid
intellectually
he
is
akin
to
sterne
though
he
is
not
a
literary
worker
there
is
an
indescribable
piquancy
about
his
epigrams
and
sallies
of
thought
he
is
eloquent
he
knows
how
to
love
but
the
uncertainty
that
appears
in
his
execution
is
a
part
of
the
very
nature
of
the
man
the
brotherhood
loved
him
for
the
very
qualities
which
the
philistine
would
style
defects

the
living

no
writer
of
our
times
possesses
more
of
the
exuberant
spirit
of
pure
comedy
than
this
poet
careless
of
fame
who
will
fling
his
more
commonplace
productions
to
theatrical
managers
and
keep
the
most
charming
scenes
in
the
seraglio
of
his
brain
for
himself
and
his
friends
of

he
asks
just
sufficient
to
secure
his
independence

then
declines
to
do
anything
more
indolent

prolific

his

his

scheme

more
dangerous
to
the

than
the
hideous
doctrines

indefinite
liberty
proclaimed

a
strange
contrast

material
poverty
in
which
the
young
men
lived
and
the
splendor
of
their
intellectual
wealth
they
looked
upon
the
practical
problems
of
existence
simply
as
matter
for
friendly
jokes
the
cold
weather
happened
to
set
in
early
that
year
five
of
friends
appeared
one
day
each
concealing
firewood
under
his
cloak
the
same
idea
had
occurred
to
the
five
as
it
sometimes
happens
that
all
the
guests
at
a
picnic
are
inspired
with
the
notion
of
bringing
a
pie
as
their
contribution
all
of
them
were
gifted
with
the
moral
beauty
which
reacts
upon
the
physical
form
and
no
less
than
work
and
vigils
overlays
a
youthful
face
with
a
shade
of
divine
gold
purity
of
life
and
the
fire
of
thought
had
brought
refinement
and
regularity
into
features
somewhat
pinched
and
rugged
the
poet
amplitude
of
brow
was
a
striking
characteristic
common
to
them
all
the
bright
sparkling
eyes
told
of
cleanliness
of
life
the
hardships
of
penury
when
they
were
felt
at
all
were
born
so
gaily
and
embraced
with
such
enthusiasm
that
they
had
left
no
trace
to
mar
the
serenity
peculiar
to
the
faces
of
the
young
who
have
no
grave
errors
laid
to
their
charge
as
yet
who
have
not
stooped
to
any
of
the
base
compromises
wrung
from
impatience
of
poverty
by
the
strong
desire
to
succeed
the
temptation
to
use
any
means
to
this
end
is
the
greater
since
that
men
of
letters
are
lenient
with
bad
faith
and
extend
an
easy
indulgence
to
treachery
there
is
an
element
in
friendship
which
doubles
its
charm
and
renders
it
indissoluble
a
sense
of
certainty
which
is
lacking
in
love
these
young
men
were
sure
of
themselves
and
of
each
other
the
enemy
of
one
was
the
enemy
of
all
the
most
urgent
personal
considerations
would
have
been
shattered
if
they
had
clashed
with
the
sacred
solidarity
of
their
fellowship
all
alike
incapable
of
disloyalty
they
could
oppose
a
formidable
no
to
any
accusation
brought
against
the
absent
and
defend
them
with
perfect
confidence
with
a
like
nobility
of
nature
and
strength
of
feeling
it
was
possible
to
think
and
speak
freely
on
all
matters
of
intellectual
or
scientific
interest
hence
the
honesty
of
their
friendships
the
gaiety
of
their
talk
and
with
this
intellectual
freedom
of
the
community
there
was
no
fear
of
being
misunderstood
they
stood
upon
no
ceremony
with
each
other
they
shared
their
troubles
and
joys
and
gave
thought
and
sympathy
from
full
hearts
the
charming
delicacy
of
feeling
which
makes
the
tale
of
a
treasury
for
great
souls
was
the
rule
of
their
daily
life
it
may
be
imagined
therefore
that
their
standard
of
requirements
was
not
an
easy
one
they
were
too
conscious
of
their
worth
too
well
aware
of
their
happiness
to
care
to
trouble
their
life
with
the
admixture
of
a
new
and
unknown
element
this
federation
of
interests
and
affection
lasted
for
twenty
years
without
a
collision
or
disappointment
death
alone
could
thin
the
numbers
of
the
noble
pleiades
taking
first
louis
lambert
later
meyraux
and
michel
chrestien
when
michel
chrestien
fell
in
his
friends
went
in
spite
of
the
perils
of
the
step
to
find
his
body
at
and
horace
bianchon
daniel
leon
giraud
joseph
bridau
and
fulgence
ridal
performed
the
last
duties
to
the
dead
between
two
political
fires
by
night
they
buried
their
beloved
in
the
cemetery
of
horace
bianchon
undaunted
by
the
difficulties
cleared
them
away
one
after
another
it
was
he
indeed
who
besought
the
authorities
for
permission
to
bury
the
fallen
insurgent
and
confessed
to
his
old
friendship
with
the
dead
federalist
the
little
group
of
friends
present
at
the
funeral
with
those
five
great
men
will
never
forget
that
touching
scene
as
you
walk
in
the
trim
cemetery
you
will
see
a
grave
purchased
in
perpetuity
a
mound
with
a
dark
wooden
cross
above
it
and
the
name
in
large
red
letters
michel
chrestien
there
is
no
other
monument
like
it
the
friends
thought
to
pay
a
tribute
to
the
sternly
simple
nature
of
the
man
by
the
simplicity
of
the
record
of
his
death
so
in
that
chilly
garret
the
fairest
dreams
of
friendship
were
realized
these
men
were
brothers
leading
lives
of
intellectual
effort
loyally
helping
each
other
making
no
reservations
not
even
of
their
worst
thoughts
men
of
vast
acquirements
natures
tried
in
the
crucible
of
poverty
once
admitted
as
an
equal
among
such
elect
souls
lucien
represented
beauty
and
poetry
they
admired
the
sonnets
which
he
read
to
them
they
would
ask
him
for
a
sonnet
as
he
would
ask
michel
chrestien
for
a
song
and
in
the
desert
of
paris
lucien
found
an
oasis
in
the
rue
des
at
the
beginning
of
october
lucien
had
spent
the
last
of
his
money
on
a
little
firewood
he
was
through
the
task
of
recasting
his
work
the
most
strenuous
of
all
toil
and
he
was
penniless
as
for
daniel
burning
blocks
of
spent
tan
and
facing
poverty
like
a
hero
not
a
word
of
complaint
came
from
him
he
was
as
sober
as
any
elderly
spinster
and
methodical
as
a
miser
this
courage
called
out
lucien
courage
he
had
only
newly
come
into
the
circle
and
shrank
with
invincible
repugnance
from
speaking
of
his
straits
one
morning
he
went
out
manuscript
in
hand
and
reached
the
rue
du
coq
he
would
sell
archer
of
charles
to
doguereau
but
doguereau
was
out
lucien
little
knew
how
indulgent
great
natures
can
be
to
the
weaknesses
of
others
every
one
of
the
friends
had
thought
of
the
peculiar
troubles
besetting
the
poetic
temperament
of
the
prostration
which
follows
upon
the
struggle
when
the
soul
has
been
overwrought
by
the
contemplation
of
that
nature
which
it
is
the
task
of
art
to
reproduce
and
strong
as
they
were
to
endure
their
own
ills
they
felt
keenly
for
lucien
distress
they
guessed
that
his
stock
of
money
was
failing
and
after
all
the
pleasant
evenings
spent
in
friendly
talk
and
deep
meditations
after
the
poetry
the
confidences
the
bold
flights
over
the
fields
of
thought
or
into
the
far
future
of
the
nations
yet
another
trait
was
to
prove
how
little
lucien
had
understood
these
new
friends
of
his
lucien
dear
fellow
said
daniel
you
did
not
dine
at
yesterday
and
we
know
why
lucien
could
not
keep
back
the
overflowing
tears
you
showed
a
want
of
confidence
in
us
said
michel
chrestien
we
shall
chalk
that
up
over
the
chimney
and
when
we
have
scored
ten
we
will
we
have
all
of
us
found
a
bit
of
extra
work
said
bianchon
for
my
own
part
i
have
been
looking
after
a
rich
patient
for
desplein
has
written
an
article
for
the
chrestien
thought
of
going
out
to
sing
in
the
champs
elysees
of
an
evening
with
a
and
four
candles
but
he
found
a
pamphlet
to
write
instead
for
a
man
who
has
a
mind
to
go
into
politics
and
gave
his
employer
six
hundred
francs
worth
of
machiavelli
leon
giraud
borrowed
fifty
francs
of
his
publisher
joseph
sold
one
or
two
sketches
and
fulgence
piece
was
given
on
sunday
and
there
was
a
full
house
here
are
two
hundred
francs
said
daniel
and
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
why
if
he
is
not
going
to
hug
us
all
as
if
we
had
done
something
extraordinary
cried
chrestien
lucien
meanwhile
had
written
to
the
home
circle
his
letter
was
a
masterpiece
of
sensibility
and
goodwill
as
well
as
a
sharp
cry
wrung
from
him
by
distress
the
answers
which
he
received
the
next
day
will
give
some
idea
of
the
delight
that
lucien
took
in
this
living
encyclopedia
of
angelic
spirits
each
of
whom
bore
the
stamp
of
the
art
or
science
which
he
followed
sechard
to
my
dear
lucien
enclosed
herewith
is
a
bill
at
ninety
days
payable
to
your
order
for
two
hundred
francs
you
can
draw
on
metivier
paper
merchant
our
paris
correspondent
in
the
rue
serpente
my
good
lucien
we
have
absolutely
nothing
eve
has
undertaken
the
charge
of
the
and
works
at
her
task
with
such
devotion
patience
and
industry
that
i
bless
heaven
for
giving
me
such
an
angel
for
a
wife
she
herself
says
that
it
is
impossible
to
send
you
the
least
help
but
i
think
my
friend
now
that
you
are
started
in
so
promising
a
way
with
such
great
and
noble
hearts
for
your
companions
that
you
can
hardly
fail
to
reach
the
greatness
to
which
you
were
born
aided
as
you
are
by
intelligence
almost
divine
in
daniel
and
michel
chrestien
and
leon
giraud
and
counseled
by
meyraux
and
bianchon
and
ridal
whom
we
have
come
to
know
through
your
dear
letter
so
i
have
drawn
this
bill
without
eve
knowledge
and
i
will
contrive
somehow
to
meet
it
when
the
time
comes
keep
on
your
way
lucien
it
is
rough
but
it
will
be
glorious
i
can
bear
anything
but
the
thought
of
you
sinking
into
the
sloughs
of
paris
of
which
i
saw
so
much
have
sufficient
strength
of
mind
to
do
as
you
are
doing
and
keep
out
of
scrapes
and
bad
company
wild
young
fellows
and
men
of
letters
of
a
certain
stamp
whom
i
learned
to
take
at
their
just
valuation
when
i
lived
in
paris
be
a
worthy
compeer
of
the
divine
spirits
whom
we
have
learned
to
love
through
you
your
life
will
soon
meet
with
its
reward
farewell
dearest
brother
you
have
sent
transports
of
joy
to
my
heart
i
did
not
expect
such
courage
of
you
david
sechard
to
dear
your
letter
made
all
of
us
cry
as
for
the
noble
hearts
to
whom
your
good
angel
surely
led
you
tell
them
that
a
mother
and
a
poor
young
wife
will
pray
for
them
night
and
morning
and
if
the
most
fervent
prayers
can
reach
the
throne
of
god
surely
they
will
bring
blessings
upon
you
all
their
names
are
engraved
upon
my
heart
ah
some
day
i
shall
see
your
friends
i
will
go
to
paris
if
i
have
to
walk
the
whole
way
to
thank
them
for
their
friendship
for
you
for
to
me
the
thought
has
been
like
balm
to
smarting
wounds
we
are
working
like
day
laborers
here
dear
this
husband
of
mine
the
unknown
great
man
whom
i
love
more
and
more
every
day
as
i
discover
moment
by
moment
the
wealth
of
his
nature
leaves
the
more
and
more
to
me
why
i
guess
our
poverty
yours
and
ours
and
our
mother
is
heartbreaking
to
him
our
adored
david
is
a
prometheus
gnawed
by
a
vulture
a
haggard
regret
as
for
himself
noble
fellow
he
scarcely
thinks
of
himself
he
is
hoping
to
make
a
fortune
for
he
spends
his
whole
time
in
experiments
in
he
begged
me
to
take
his
place
and
look
after
the
business
and
gives
me
as
much
help
as
his
preoccupation
allows
alas
i
shall
be
a
mother
soon
that
should
have
been
a
crowning
joy
but
as
things
are
it
saddens
me
poor
mother
she
has
grown
young
again
she
has
found
strength
to
go
back
to
her
tiring
nursing
we
should
be
happy
if
it
were
not
for
these
money
cares
old
father
sechard
will
not
give
his
son
a
farthing
david
went
over
to
see
if
he
could
borrow
a
little
for
you
for
we
were
in
despair
over
your
letter
know
lucien
david
said
will
lose
his
head
and
do
something
rash
i
gave
him
a
good
scolding
brother
disappoint
us
in
any
way
i
told
him
knows
that
i
should
die
of
sorrow
mother
and
i
have
pawned
a
few
things
david
does
not
know
about
it
mother
will
redeem
them
as
soon
as
she
has
made
a
little
money
in
this
way
we
have
managed
to
put
together
a
hundred
francs
which
i
am
sending
you
by
the
coach
if
i
did
not
answer
your
last
letter
do
not
remember
it
against
me
dear
we
were
working
all
night
just
then
i
have
been
working
like
a
man
oh
i
had
no
idea
that
i
was
so
strong
mme
de
bargeton
is
a
heartless
woman
she
has
no
soul
even
if
she
cared
for
you
no
longer
she
owed
it
to
herself
to
use
her
influence
for
you
and
to
help
you
when
she
had
torn
you
from
us
to
plunge
you
into
that
dreadful
sea
of
paris
only
by
the
special
blessing
of
heaven
could
you
have
met
with
true
friends
there
among
those
crowds
of
men
and
innumerable
interests
she
is
not
worth
a
regret
i
used
to
wish
that
there
might
be
some
devoted
woman
always
with
you
a
second
myself
but
now
i
know
that
your
friends
will
take
my
place
and
i
am
happy
spread
your
wings
my
dear
great
genius
you
will
be
our
pride
as
well
as
our
beloved
eve
my
darling
the
mother
wrote
i
can
only
add
my
blessing
to
all
that
your
sister
says
and
assure
you
that
you
are
more
in
my
thoughts
and
in
my
prayers
alas
than
those
whom
i
see
daily
for
some
hearts
the
absent
are
always
in
the
right
and
so
it
is
with
the
heart
of
your
mother
so
two
days
after
the
loan
was
offered
so
graciously
lucien
repaid
it
perhaps
life
had
never
seemed
so
bright
to
him
as
at
that
moment
but
the
touch
of
in
his
joy
did
not
escape
the
delicate
sensibility
and
searching
eyes
of
his
friends
any
one
might
think
that
you
were
afraid
to
owe
us
anything
exclaimed
fulgence
oh
the
pleasure
that
he
takes
in
returning
the
money
is
a
very
serious
symptom
to
my
mind
said
michel
chrestien
it
confirms
some
observations
of
my
own
there
is
a
spice
of
vanity
in
lucien
he
is
a
poet
said
but
do
you
grudge
me
such
a
very
natural
feeling
asked
lucien
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
he
did
not
hide
it
said
leon
giraud
he
is
still
open
with
us
but
i
am
afraid
that
he
may
come
to
feel
shy
of
us
and
why
lucien
asked
we
can
read
your
thoughts
answered
joseph
bridau
there
is
a
diabolical
spirit
in
you
that
will
seek
to
justify
courses
which
are
utterly
contrary
to
our
principles
instead
of
being
a
sophist
in
theory
you
will
be
a
sophist
in
practice
ah
i
am
afraid
of
that
said
you
will
carry
on
admirable
debates
in
your
own
mind
lucien
and
take
up
a
lofty
position
in
theory
and
end
by
blameworthy
actions
you
will
never
be
at
one
with
yourself
what
ground
have
you
for
these
charges
thy
vanity
dear
poet
is
so
great
that
it
intrudes
itself
even
into
thy
friendships
cried
fulgence
all
vanity
of
that
sort
is
a
symptom
of
shocking
egoism
and
egoism
poisons
friendship
oh
dear
said
lucien
you
can
not
know
how
much
i
love
you
all
if
you
loved
us
as
we
love
you
would
you
have
been
in
such
a
hurry
to
return
the
money
which
we
had
such
pleasure
in
lending
or
have
made
so
much
of
it
we
do
lend
here
we
give
said
joseph
bridau
roughly
do
think
us
unkind
dear
boy
said
michel
chrestien
we
are
looking
forward
we
are
afraid
lest
some
day
you
may
prefer
a
petty
revenge
to
the
joys
of
pure
friendship
read
goethe
the
great
master
greatest
work
and
you
will
see
how
the
loved
gorgeous
stuffs
and
banquets
and
triumph
and
applause
very
well
be
tasso
without
his
folly
perhaps
the
world
and
its
pleasures
tempt
you
stay
with
us
carry
all
the
cravings
of
vanity
into
the
world
of
imagination
transpose
folly
keep
virtue
for
daily
wear
and
let
imagination
run
riot
instead
of
doing
as
says
thinking
high
thoughts
and
living
beneath
them
lucien
hung
his
head
his
friends
were
right
i
confess
that
you
are
stronger
than
i
he
said
with
a
charming
glance
at
them
my
back
and
shoulders
are
not
made
to
bear
the
burden
of
paris
life
i
can
not
struggle
bravely
we
are
born
with
different
temperaments
and
faculties
and
you
know
better
than
i
that
faults
and
virtues
have
their
reverse
side
i
am
tired
already
i
confess
we
will
stand
by
you
said
it
is
just
in
these
ways
that
a
faithful
friendship
is
of
use
the
help
that
i
have
just
received
is
precarious
and
every
one
of
us
is
just
as
poor
as
another
want
will
soon
overtake
me
again
chrestien
at
the
service
of
the
first
that
hires
him
can
do
nothing
with
the
publishers
bianchon
is
quite
out
of
it
booksellers
only
deal
in
scientific
and
technical
books
they
have
no
connection
with
publishers
of
new
literature
and
as
for
horace
and
fulgence
ridal
and
bridau
their
work
lies
miles
away
from
the
booksellers
there
is
no
help
for
it
i
must
make
up
my
mind
one
way
or
another
stick
by
us
and
make
up
your
mind
to
it
said
bianchon
bear
up
bravely
and
trust
in
hard
work
but
what
is
hardship
for
you
is
death
for
me
lucien
put
in
quickly
before
the
cock
crows
thrice
smiled
leon
giraud
this
man
will
betray
the
cause
of
work
for
an
idle
life
and
the
vices
of
paris
where
has
work
brought
you
asked
lucien
laughing
when
you
start
out
from
paris
for
italy
you
do
find
rome
said
joseph
bridau
you
want
your
pease
to
grow
ready
buttered
for
you
the
conversation
ended
in
a
joke
and
they
changed
the
subject
lucien
friends
with
their
perspicacity
and
delicacy
of
heart
tried
to
efface
the
memory
of
the
little
quarrel
but
lucien
knew
thenceforward
that
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
deceive
them
he
soon
fell
into
despair
which
he
was
careful
to
hide
from
such
stern
mentors
as
he
imagined
them
to
be
and
the
southern
temper
that
runs
so
easily
through
the
whole
gamut
of
mental
dispositions
set
him
making
the
most
contradictory
resolutions
again
and
again
he
talked
of
making
the
plunge
into
journalism
and
time
after
time
did
his
friends
reply
with
a
mind
you
do
nothing
of
the
sort
it
would
be
the
tomb
of
the
beautiful
gracious
lucien
whom
we
love
and
know
said
you
would
not
hold
out
for
long
between
the
two
extremes
of
toil
and
pleasure
which
make
up
a
journalist
life
and
resistance
is
the
very
foundation
of
virtue
you
would
be
so
delighted
to
exercise
your
power
of
life
and
death
over
the
offspring
of
the
brain
that
you
would
be
an
journalist
in
two
months
time
to
be
a
journalist
that
is
to
turn
herod
in
the
republic
of
letters
the
man
who
will
say
anything
will
end
by
sticking
at
nothing
that
was
maxim
and
it
explains
itself
but
you
would
be
with
me
would
you
not
asked
lucien
not
by
that
time
said
fulgence
if
you
were
a
journalist
you
would
no
more
think
of
us
than
the
opera
girl
in
all
her
glory
with
her
adorers
and
her
carriage
thinks
of
the
village
at
home
and
her
cows
and
her
sabots
you
could
never
resist
the
temptation
to
pen
a
witticism
though
it
should
bring
tears
to
a
friend
eyes
i
come
across
journalists
in
theatre
lobbies
it
makes
me
shudder
to
see
them
journalism
is
an
inferno
a
bottomless
pit
of
iniquity
and
treachery
and
lies
no
one
can
traverse
it
undefiled
unless
like
dante
he
is
protected
by
virgil
sacred
laurel
but
the
more
the
set
of
friends
opposed
the
idea
of
journalism
the
more
lucien
desire
to
know
its
perils
grew
and
tempted
him
he
began
to
debate
within
his
own
mind
was
it
not
ridiculous
to
allow
want
to
find
him
a
second
time
defenceless
he
bethought
him
of
the
failure
of
his
attempts
to
dispose
of
his
first
novel
and
felt
but
little
tempted
to
begin
a
second
how
besides
was
he
to
live
while
he
was
writing
another
romance
one
month
of
privation
had
exhausted
his
stock
of
patience
why
should
he
not
do
nobly
that
which
journalists
did
ignobly
and
without
principle
his
friends
insulted
him
with
their
doubts
he
would
convince
them
of
his
strength
of
mind
some
day
perhaps
he
would
be
of
use
to
them
he
would
be
the
herald
of
their
fame
and
what
sort
of
a
friendship
is
it
which
recoils
from
complicity
demanded
he
one
evening
of
michel
chrestien
lucien
and
leon
giraud
were
walking
home
with
their
friend
we
shrink
from
nothing
michel
chrestien
made
reply
if
you
were
so
unlucky
as
to
kill
your
mistress
i
would
help
you
to
hide
your
crime
and
could
still
respect
you
but
if
you
were
to
turn
spy
i
should
shun
you
with
abhorrence
for
a
spy
is
systematically
shameless
and
base
there
you
have
journalism
summed
up
in
a
sentence
friendship
can
pardon
error
and
the
hasty
impulse
of
passion
it
is
bound
to
be
inexorable
when
a
man
deliberately
traffics
in
his
own
soul
and
intellect
and
opinions
why
can
not
i
turn
journalist
to
sell
my
volume
of
poetry
and
the
novel
and
then
give
up
at
once
machiavelli
might
do
so
but
not
lucien
de
rubempre
said
leon
giraud
very
well
exclaimed
lucien
i
will
show
you
that
i
can
do
as
much
as
machiavelli
oh
cried
michel
grasping
leon
hand
you
have
done
it
leon
lucien
he
continued
you
have
three
hundred
francs
in
hand
you
can
live
comfortably
for
three
months
very
well
then
work
hard
and
write
another
romance
and
fulgence
will
help
you
with
the
plot
you
will
improve
you
will
be
a
novelist
and
i
meanwhile
will
enter
one
of
those
of
thought
for
three
months
i
will
be
a
journalist
i
will
sell
your
books
to
some
bookseller
or
other
by
attacking
his
publications
i
will
write
the
articles
myself
i
will
get
others
for
you
we
will
organize
a
success
you
shall
be
a
great
man
and
still
remain
our
lucien
you
must
despise
me
very
much
if
you
think
that
i
should
perish
while
you
escape
said
the
poet
o
lord
forgive
him
it
is
a
child
cried
michel
chrestien
when
lucien
intellect
had
been
stimulated
by
the
evenings
spent
in
garret
he
had
made
some
study
of
the
jokes
and
articles
in
the
smaller
newspapers
he
was
at
least
the
equal
he
felt
of
the
wittiest
contributors
in
private
he
tried
some
mental
gymnastics
of
the
kind
and
went
out
one
morning
with
the
triumphant
idea
of
finding
some
colonel
of
such
light
skirmishers
of
the
press
and
enlisting
in
their
ranks
he
dressed
in
his
best
and
crossed
the
bridges
thinking
as
he
went
that
authors
journalists
and
men
of
letters
his
future
comrades
in
short
would
show
him
rather
more
kindness
and
disinterestedness
than
the
two
species
of
booksellers
who
had
so
dashed
his
hopes
he
should
meet
with
and
something
of
the
kindly
and
grateful
affection
which
he
found
in
the
of
the
rue
des
tormented
by
emotion
consequent
upon
the
presentiments
to
which
men
of
imagination
cling
so
fondly
half
believing
half
battling
with
their
belief
in
them
he
arrived
in
the
rue
off
the
boulevard
montmartre
before
a
house
occupied
by
the
offices
of
a
small
newspaper
he
stopped
and
at
the
sight
of
it
his
heart
began
to
throb
as
heavily
as
the
pulses
of
a
youth
upon
the
threshold
of
some
evil
haunt
nevertheless
upstairs
he
went
and
found
the
offices
in
the
low
between
the
ground
floor
and
the
first
story
the
first
room
was
divided
down
the
middle
by
a
partition
the
lower
half
of
solid
wood
the
upper
lattice
work
to
the
ceiling
in
this
apartment
lucien
discovered
a
pensioner
supporting
several
reams
of
paper
on
his
head
with
his
remaining
hand
while
between
his
teeth
he
held
the
passbook
which
the
inland
revenue
department
requires
every
newspaper
to
produce
with
each
issue
this
individual
owner
of
a
yellow
countenance
covered
with
red
excrescences
to
which
he
owed
his
nickname
of
coloquinte
indicated
a
personage
behind
the
lattice
as
the
cerberus
of
the
paper
this
was
an
elderly
officer
with
a
medal
on
his
chest
and
a
silk
on
his
head
his
nose
was
almost
hidden
by
a
pair
of
grizzled
moustaches
and
his
person
was
hidden
as
completely
in
an
ample
blue
overcoat
as
the
body
of
the
turtle
in
its
carapace
from
what
date
do
you
wish
your
subscription
to
commence
sir
inquired
the
emperor
officer
i
did
not
come
about
a
subscription
returned
lucien
looking
about
him
he
saw
a
placard
fastened
on
a
door
corresponding
to
the
one
by
which
he
had
entered
and
read
the
words
editor
office
and
below
in
smaller
letters
admittance
except
on
a
complaint
i
expect
replied
the
veteran
ah
yes
we
have
been
hard
on
mariette
what
would
you
have
i
do
know
the
why
and
wherefore
of
it
but
if
you
want
satisfaction
i
am
ready
for
you
he
added
glancing
at
a
collection
of
small
arms
and
foils
stacked
in
a
corner
the
armory
of
the
modern
warrior
that
was
still
further
from
my
intention
sir
i
have
come
to
speak
to
the
editor
nobody
is
ever
here
before
four
look
you
here
giroudeau
old
chap
remarked
a
voice
i
make
it
eleven
columns
eleven
columns
at
five
francs
apiece
is
francs
and
i
have
only
been
paid
forty
so
you
owe
me
another
fifteen
francs
as
i
have
been
telling
you
these
words
proceeded
from
a
little
pallid
and
as
the
white
of
an
egg
two
slits
of
eyes
looked
out
of
it
mild
blue
in
tint
but
appallingly
malignant
in
expression
and
the
owner
an
insignificant
young
man
was
completely
hidden
by
the
veteran
opaque
person
it
was
a
voice
a
sound
between
the
mewing
of
a
cat
and
the
wheezy
chokings
of
a
hyena
yes
yes
my
little
militiaman
retorted
he
of
the
medal
but
you
are
counting
the
headings
and
white
lines
i
have
finot
instructions
to
add
up
the
totals
of
the
lines
and
to
divide
them
by
the
proper
number
for
each
column
and
after
i
performed
that
concentrating
operation
on
your
copy
there
were
three
columns
less
he
does
pay
for
the
blanks
the
jew
he
reckons
them
in
though
when
he
sends
up
the
total
of
his
work
to
his
partner
and
he
gets
paid
for
them
too
i
will
go
and
see
etienne
lousteau
vernou
i
can
not
go
beyond
my
orders
my
boy
said
the
veteran
what
do
you
cry
out
against
your
for
a
matter
of
fifteen
francs
you
that
turn
out
an
article
as
easily
as
i
smoke
a
cigar
fifteen
francs
why
you
will
give
a
bowl
of
punch
to
your
friends
or
win
an
extra
game
of
billiards
and
there
an
end
of
it
finot
savings
will
cost
him
very
dear
said
the
contributor
as
he
took
his
departure
now
would
not
anybody
think
that
he
was
rousseau
and
voltaire
rolled
in
one
the
cashier
remarked
to
himself
as
he
glanced
at
lucien
i
will
come
in
again
at
four
sir
said
lucien
while
the
argument
proceeded
lucien
had
been
looking
about
him
he
saw
upon
the
walls
the
portraits
of
benjamin
constant
general
foy
and
the
seventeen
illustrious
orators
of
the
left
interspersed
with
caricatures
at
the
expense
of
the
government
but
he
looked
more
particularly
at
the
door
of
the
sanctuary
where
no
doubt
the
paper
was
elaborated
the
witty
paper
that
amused
him
daily
and
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
ridiculing
kings
and
the
most
portentous
events
of
calling
anything
and
everything
in
question
with
a
jest
then
he
sauntered
along
the
boulevards
it
was
an
entirely
novel
amusement
and
so
agreeable
did
he
find
it
that
looking
at
the
turret
clocks
he
saw
the
hour
hands
were
pointing
to
four
and
only
then
remembered
that
he
had
not
breakfasted
he
went
at
once
in
the
direction
of
the
rue
climbed
the
stair
and
opened
the
door
the
veteran
officer
was
absent
but
the
old
pensioner
sitting
on
a
pile
of
stamped
papers
was
munching
a
crust
and
acting
as
sentinel
resignedly
coloquinte
was
as
much
accustomed
to
his
work
in
the
office
as
to
the
fatigue
duty
of
former
days
understanding
as
much
or
as
little
about
it
as
the
why
and
wherefore
of
forced
marches
made
by
the
emperor
orders
lucien
was
inspired
with
the
bold
idea
of
deceiving
that
formidable
functionary
he
settled
his
hat
on
his
head
and
walked
into
the
editor
office
as
if
he
were
quite
at
home
looking
eagerly
about
him
he
beheld
a
round
table
covered
with
a
green
cloth
and
chairs
newly
reseated
with
straw
the
colored
brick
floor
had
not
been
waxed
but
it
was
clean
so
clean
that
the
public
evidently
seldom
entered
the
room
there
was
a
mirror
above
the
and
on
the
ledge
below
amid
a
sprinkling
of
stood
a
shopkeeper
clock
smothered
with
dust
and
a
couple
of
candlesticks
with
tallow
dips
thrust
into
their
sockets
a
few
antique
newspapers
lay
on
the
table
beside
an
inkstand
containing
some
black
substance
and
a
collection
of
quill
pens
twisted
into
stars
sundry
dirty
scraps
of
paper
covered
with
almost
undecipherable
hieroglyphs
proved
to
be
manuscript
articles
torn
across
the
top
by
the
compositor
to
check
off
the
sheets
as
they
were
set
up
he
admired
a
few
rather
clever
caricatures
sketched
on
bits
of
brown
paper
by
somebody
who
evidently
had
tried
to
kill
time
by
killing
something
else
to
keep
his
hand
in
other
works
of
art
were
pinned
in
the
cheap
these
consisted
of
nine
illustrations
for
the
work
had
attained
to
such
an
european
popularity
that
journalists
evidently
were
tired
of
the
solitary
makes
his
first
appearance
in
the
provinces
sensation
among
the
the
solitary
perused
at
a
effect
of
the
solitary
on
domestic
animals
the
solitary
explained
to
savage
tribes
with
the
most
brilliant
the
solitary
translated
into
chinese
and
presented
by
the
author
to
the
emperor
at
the
mont
sauvage
rape
of
elodie
lucien
though
this
caricature
very
shocking
but
he
could
not
help
laughing
at
it
the
solitary
under
a
canopy
conducted
in
triumphal
procession
by
the
the
solitary
breaks
the
press
to
splinters
and
wounds
the
read
backwards
the
superior
beauties
of
the
solitary
produce
a
sensation
at
the
academie
on
a
lucien
noticed
a
sketch
of
a
contributor
holding
out
his
hat
and
beneath
it
the
words
finot
my
hundred
francs
and
a
name
since
grown
more
notorious
than
famous
between
the
window
and
the
stood
a
a
mahogany
armchair
and
a
basket
on
a
strip
of
the
dust
lay
thick
on
all
these
objects
there
were
short
curtains
in
the
windows
about
a
score
of
new
books
lay
on
the
deposited
there
apparently
during
the
day
together
with
prints
music
of
the
charter
pattern
a
copy
of
the
ninth
edition
of
the
great
joke
of
the
moment
and
some
ten
unopened
letters
lucien
had
taken
stock
of
this
strange
furniture
and
made
reflections
of
the
most
exhaustive
kind
upon
it
when
the
clock
striking
five
he
returned
to
question
the
pensioner
coloquinte
had
finished
his
crust
and
was
waiting
with
the
patience
of
a
commissionaire
for
the
man
of
medals
who
perhaps
was
taking
an
airing
on
the
boulevard
at
this
conjuncture
the
rustle
of
a
dress
sounded
on
the
stair
and
the
light
unmistakable
footstep
of
a
woman
on
the
threshold
the
newcomer
was
passably
pretty
she
addressed
herself
to
lucien
sir
she
said
i
know
why
you
cry
up
mlle
virginie
hats
so
much
and
i
have
come
to
put
down
my
name
for
a
year
subscription
in
the
first
place
but
tell
me
your
conditions
i
am
not
connected
with
the
paper
madame
oh
a
subscription
dating
from
october
inquired
the
pensioner
what
does
the
lady
want
to
know
asked
the
veteran
reappearing
on
the
scene
the
fair
milliner
and
the
retired
military
man
were
soon
deep
in
converse
and
when
lucien
beginning
to
lose
patience
came
back
to
the
first
room
he
heard
the
conclusion
of
the
matter
why
i
shall

while

have
lucien
heard
a
sound
as
of
coins
dropping
into
a
cashbox
and
the
veteran
began
to
make
up
his
books
for
the
day
i
have

hour

napoleon

lucien
having
caught
the

is
in
the
rue

that
where
he
lives
coloquinte
old
chap

to
himself
the

repeated
the
officer
as
he
received
the
rest
of
the
stamp

from

the

broum

the

sir
is
written
in
the
street
at
the
writers
houses
in
the
between
eleven
and
twelve
at
night
in
the
emperor
time
sir
these
shops
for
spoiled
paper
were
not
known
oh
he
would
have
cleared
them
out
with
four
men
and
a
corporal
they
would
not
have
come
over
with
their
talk
but
that
is
enough
of
prattling
if
my
nephew
finds
it
worth
his
while
and
so
long
as
they
write
for
the
son
of
the
other
broum
broum
after
all
there
is
no
harm
in
that
ah
by
the
way
subscribers
do
seem
to
me
to
be
advancing
in
serried
columns
i
shall
leave
my
post
you
seem
to
know
all
about
the
newspaper
sir
lucien
began
from
a
business
point
of
view
broum
broum
coughed
the
soldier
clearing
his
throat
from
three
to
five
francs
per
column
according
to
fifty
lines
to
a
column
forty
letters
to
a
line
no
blanks
there
you
are
as
for
the
staff
they
are
queer
fish
little
youngsters
whom
i
would
take
on
for
the
commissariat
and
because
they
make
fly
tracks
on
sheets
of
white
paper
they
look
down
forsooth
on
an
old
captain
of
dragoons
of
the
guard
that
retired
with
a
major
rank
after
entering
every
european
capital
with
napoleon
the
soldier
of
napoleon
brushed
his
coat
and
made
as
if
he
would
go
out
but
lucien
swept
to
the
door
had
courage
enough
to
make
a
stand
i
came
to
be
a
contributor
of
the
paper
he
said
i
am
full
of
respect
i
vow
and
declare
for
a
captain
of
the
imperial
guard
those
men
of
bronze
well
said
my
little
civilian
there
are
several
kinds
of
contributors
which
kind
do
you
wish
to
be
replied
the
trooper
bearing
down
on
lucien
and
descending
the
stairs
at
the
foot
of
the
flight
he
stopped
but
it
was
only
to
light
a
cigar
at
the
box
if
any
subscribers
come
you
see
them
and
take
note
of
them
mother
simply
subscribers
never
know
anything
but
subscribers
he
added
seeing
that
lucien
followed
him
finot
is
my
nephew
he
is
the
only
one
of
my
family
that
has
done
anything
to
relieve
me
in
my
position
so
when
anybody
comes
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
finot
he
finds
old
giroudeau
captain
of
the
dragoons
of
the
guard
that
set
out
as
a
private
in
a
cavalry
regiment
in
the
army
of
the
and
was
for
five
years
to
the
first
hussars
army
of
italy
one
two
and
the
man
that
had
any
complaints
to
make
would
be
turned
off
into
the
dark
he
added
making
a
lunge
now
writers
my
boy
are
in
different
corps
there
is
the
writer
who
writes
and
draws
his
pay
there
is
the
writer
who
writes
and
gets
nothing
a
volunteer
we
call
him
and
lastly
there
is
the
writer
who
writes
nothing
and
he
is
by
no
means
the
stupidest
for
he
makes
no
mistakes
he
gives
himself
out
for
a
literary
man
he
is
on
the
paper
he
treats
us
to
dinners
he
loafs
about
the
theatres
he
keeps
an
actress
he
is
very
well
off
what
do
you
mean
to
be
the
man
that
does
good
work
and
gets
good
pay
you
are
like
the
recruits
they
all
want
to
be
marshals
of
france
take
old
giroudeau
word
for
it
and
turn
right
about
in
time
and
go
and
pick
up
nails
in
the
gutter
like
that
good
fellow
yonder
you
can
tell
by
the
look
of
him
that
he
has
been
in
the
is
it
a
shame
that
an
old
soldier
who
has
walked
into
the
jaws
of
death
hundreds
of
times
should
be
picking
up
old
iron
in
the
streets
of
paris
ah
god
was
a
shabby
trick
to
desert
the
well
my
boy
the
individual
you
saw
this
morning
has
made
his
forty
francs
a
month
are
you
going
to
do
better
and
according
to
finot
he
is
the
cleverest
man
on
the
staff
when
you
enlisted
in
the
did
they
talk
about
danger
rather
very
well
very
well
go
and
see
my
nephew
finot
a
good
fellow
as
good
a
fellow
as
you
will
find
if
you
can
find
him
that
is
for
he
is
like
a
fish
always
on
the
move
in
his
way
of
business
there
is
no
writing
you
see
it
is
setting
others
to
write
that
sort
like
gallivanting
about
with
actresses
better
than
scribbling
on
sheets
of
paper
it
seems
oh
they
are
queer
customers
they
are
hope
i
may
have
the
honor
of
seeing
you
again
with
that
the
cashier
raised
his
formidable
loaded
cane
one
of
the
defenders
of
germainicus
and
walked
off
leaving
lucien
in
the
street
as
much
bewildered
by
this
picture
of
the
newspaper
world
as
he
had
formerly
been
by
the
practical
aspects
of
literature
at
vidal
and
porchon
establishment
ten
several
times
did
lucien
repair
to
the
rue
feydeau
in
search
of
andoche
finot
and
ten
times
he
failed
to
find
that
gentleman
he
went
first
thing
in
the
morning
finot
had
not
come
in
at
noon
finot
had
gone
out
he
was
breakfasting
at
such
and
such
a
cafe
at
the
cafe
in
answer
to
inquiries
of
the
waitress
made
after
surmounting
unspeakable
repugnance
lucien
heard
that
finot
had
just
left
the
place
lucien
at
length
tired
out
began
to
regard
finot
as
a
mythical
and
fabulous
character
it
appeared
simpler
to
waylay
etienne
lousteau
at
flicoteaux
that
youthful
journalist
would
doubtless
explain
the
mysteries
that
enveloped
the
paper
for
which
he
wrote
since
the
day
a
hundred
times
blessed
when
lucien
made
the
acquaintance
of
daniel
he
had
taken
another
seat
at
flicoteaux
the
two
friends
dined
side
by
side
talking
in
lowered
voices
of
the
higher
literature
of
suggested
subjects
and
ways
of
presenting
opening
up
and
developing
them
at
the
present
time
daniel
was
correcting
the
manuscript
of
archer
of
charles
he
reconstructed
whole
chapters
and
wrote
the
fine
passages
found
therein
as
well
as
the
magnificent
preface
which
is
perhaps
the
best
thing
in
the
book
and
throws
so
much
light
on
the
work
of
the
young
school
of
literature
one
day
it
so
happened
that
daniel
had
been
waiting
for
lucien
who
now
sat
with
his
friend
hand
in
his
own
when
he
saw
etienne
lousteau
turn
the
lucien
instantly
dropped
daniel
hand
and
told
the
waiter
that
he
would
dine
at
his
old
place
by
the
counter
gave
lucien
a
glance
of
divine
kindness
in
which
reproach
was
wrapped
in
forgiveness
the
glance
cut
the
poet
to
the
quick
he
took
daniel
hand
and
grasped
it
anew
it
is
an
important
question
of
business
for
me
i
will
tell
you
about
it
afterwards
said
he
lucien
was
in
his
old
place
by
the
time
that
lousteau
reached
the
table
as
the
first
comer
he
greeted
his
acquaintance
they
soon
struck
up
a
conversation
which
grew
so
lively
that
lucien
went
off
in
search
of
the
manuscript
of
the
while
lousteau
finished
his
dinner
he
had
obtained
leave
to
lay
his
sonnets
before
the
journalist
and
mistook
the
civility
of
the
latter
for
willingness
to
find
him
a
publisher
or
a
place
on
the
paper
when
lucien
came
hurrying
back
again
he
saw
resting
an
elbow
on
the
table
in
a
corner
of
the
restaurant
and
knew
that
his
friend
was
watching
him
with
melancholy
eyes
but
he
would
not
see
just
then
he
felt
the
sharp
pangs
of
poverty
the
goadings
of
ambition
and
followed
lousteau
in
the
late
afternoon
the
journalist
and
the
neophyte
went
to
the
luxembourg
and
sat
down
under
the
trees
in
that
part
of
the
gardens
which
lies
between
the
broad
avenue
de
and
the
rue
de
the
rue
de
at
that
time
was
a
long
morass
bounded
by
planks
and
the
houses
were
all
at
the
end
nearest
the
rue
de
vaugirard
and
the
walk
through
the
gardens
was
so
little
frequented
that
at
the
hour
when
paris
dines
two
lovers
might
fall
out
and
exchange
the
earnest
of
reconciliation
without
fear
of
intruders
the
only
possible
was
the
pensioner
on
duty
at
the
little
iron
gate
on
the
rue
de
if
that
veteran
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
lengthen
his
monotonous
beat
there
on
a
bench
beneath
the
etienne
lousteau
sat
and
listened
to
from
the
etienne
lousteau
after
a
apprenticeship
was
on
the
staff
of
a
newspaper
he
had
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
he
reckoned
some
of
the
celebrities
of
the
day
among
his
friends
altogether
he
was
an
imposing
personage
in
lucien
eyes
wherefore
while
lucien
untied
the
string
about
the
he
judged
it
necessary
to
make
some
sort
of
preface
the
sonnet
monsieur
said
he
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
forms
of
poetry
it
has
fallen
almost
entirely
into
disuse
no
frenchman
can
hope
to
rival
petrarch
for
the
language
in
which
the
italian
wrote
being
so
infinitely
more
pliant
than
french
lends
itself
to
play
of
thought
which
our
positivism
pardon
the
use
of
the
expression
rejects
so
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
volume
of
sonnets
would
be
something
quite
new
victor
hugo
has
appropriated
the
old
canalis
writes
lighter
verse
beranger
has
monopolized
songs
casimir
delavigne
has
taken
tragedy
and
lamartine
the
poetry
of
meditation
are
you
a
or
a
inquired
lousteau
lucien
astonishment
betrayed
such
complete
ignorance
of
the
state
of
affairs
in
the
republic
of
letters
that
lousteau
thought
it
necessary
to
enlighten
him
you
have
come
up
in
the
middle
of
a
pitched
battle
my
dear
fellow
you
must
make
your
decision
at
once
literature
is
divided
in
the
first
place
into
several
zones
but
our
great
men
are
ranged
in
two
hostile
camps
the
royalists
are
the
liberals
are
the
divergence
of
taste
in
matters
literary
and
divergence
of
political
opinion
coincide
and
the
result
is
a
war
with
weapons
of
every
sort
witticisms
subtle
calumnies
and
nicknames
between
the
rising
and
the
waning
glory
and
ink
is
shed
in
torrents
the
odd
part
of
it
is
that
the
are
all
for
liberty
in
literature
and
for
repealing
laws
and
conventions
while
the
are
for
maintaining
the
unities
the
alexandrine
and
the
classical
theme
so
opinions
in
politics
on
either
side
are
directly
at
variance
with
literary
taste
if
you
are
eclectic
you
will
have
no
one
for
you
which
side
do
you
take
which
is
the
winning
side
the
liberal
newspapers
have
far
more
subscribers
than
the
royalist
and
ministerial
journals
still
though
canalis
is
for
church
and
king
and
patronized
by
the
court
and
the
clergy
he
reaches
other
pshaw
sonnets
date
back
to
an
epoch
before
boileau
time
said
etienne
seeing
lucien
dismay
at
the
prospect
of
choosing
between
two
banners
be
a
romantic
the
romantics
are
young
men
and
the
classics
are
pedants
the
romantics
will
gain
the
day
the
word
pedant
was
the
latest
epithet
taken
up
by
romantic
journalism
to
heap
confusion
on
the
classical
faction
lucien
began
to
read
choosing
first
of
all
the
easter
daisies
the
daisies
in
the
meadows
not
in
vain
in
red
and
white
and
gold
before
our
eyes
have
written
an
idyll
for
man
sympathies
and
set
his
heart
desire
in
language
plain
gold
stamens
set
in
silver
filigrane
reveal
the
treasures
which
we
idolize
and
all
the
cost
of
struggle
for
the
prize
is
symboled
by
a
secret
stain
was
it
because
your
petals
once
uncurled
when
jesus
rose
upon
a
fairer
world
and
from
wings
shaken
for
a
flight
shed
grace
that
still
as
autumn
reappears
you
bloom
again
to
tell
of
dead
delight
to
bring
us
back
the
flower
of
twenty
years
lucien
felt
piqued
by
lousteau
complete
indifference
during
the
reading
of
the
sonnet
he
was
unfamiliar
as
yet
with
the
disconcerting
impassibility
of
the
professional
critic
wearied
by
much
reading
of
poetry
prose
and
plays
lucien
was
accustomed
to
applause
he
choked
down
his
disappointment
and
read
another
a
favorite
with
mme
de
bargeton
and
with
some
of
his
friends
in
the
rue
des
this
one
perhaps
will
draw
a
word
from
him
he
thought
the
marguerite
i
am
the
marguerite
fair
and
tall
i
grew
in
velvet
meadows
the
flowers
a
star
they
sought
me
for
my
beauty
near
and
far
my
dawn
i
thought
should
be
for
ever
new
but
now
an
all
gift
i
rue
a
fatal
ray
of
knowledge
shed
to
mar
my
radiant
grown
oracular
for
i
must
speak
and
give
an
answer
true
an
end
of
silence
and
of
quiet
days
the
lover
with
two
words
my
counsel
prays
and
when
my
secret
from
my
heart
is
reft
when
all
my
silver
petals
scattered
lie
i
am
the
only
flower
neglected
left
cast
down
and
trodden
under
foot
to
die
at
the
end
the
poet
looked
up
at
his
aristarchus
etienne
lousteau
was
gazing
at
the
trees
in
the
pepiniere
well
asked
lucien
well
my
dear
fellow
go
on
i
am
listening
to
you
am
i
not
that
fact
in
itself
is
as
good
as
praise
in
paris
have
you
had
enough
lucien
asked
go
on
the
other
answered
abruptly
enough
lucien
proceeded
to
read
the
following
sonnet
but
his
heart
was
dead
within
him
lousteau
inscrutable
composure
froze
his
utterance
if
he
had
come
a
little
further
upon
the
road
he
would
have
known
that
between
writer
and
writer
silence
or
abrupt
speech
under
such
circumstances
is
a
betrayal
of
jealousy
and
outspoken
admiration
means
a
sense
of
relief
over
the
discovery
that
the
work
is
not
above
the
average
after
all
the
camellia
in
nature
book
if
rightly
understood
the
rose
means
love
and
red
for
beauty
glows
a
pure
sweet
spirit
in
the
violet
blows
and
bright
the
lily
gleams
in
lowlihood
but
this
strange
bloom
by
sun
and
wind
unwooed
seems
to
expand
and
blossom
the
snows
a
lily
sceptreless
a
scentless
rose
for
dainty
listlessness
of
maidenhood
yet
at
the
opera
house
the
petals
trace
for
modesty
a
fitting
aureole
an
alabaster
wreath
to
lay
methought
in
dusky
hair
some
fair
woman
face
which
kindles
such
love
within
the
soul
as
sculptured
marble
forms
by
phidias
wrought
what
do
you
think
of
my
poor
sonnets
lucien
asked
coming
straight
to
the
point
do
you
want
the
truth
i
am
young
enough
to
like
the
truth
and
so
anxious
to
succeed
that
i
can
hear
it
without
taking
offence
but
not
without
despair
replied
lucien
well
my
dear
fellow
the
first
sonnet
from
its
involved

you
so
much
trouble
no
doubt
that
you
can
not
give
it
up
the
second

third
smack
of
paris
already

read
us
one
more
sonnet
he
added
with
a
gesture
that
seemed
charming
to
the
provincial
encouraged
by
the
request
lucien
read
with
more
confidence
choosing
a
sonnet
which
and
bridau
liked
best
perhaps
on
account
of
its
color
the
tulip
i
am
the
tulip
from
batavia
shore
the
thrifty
fleming
for
my
beauty
rare

a
king

when
that
i
am
fair
and
tall
and
straight
and
pure
my

like
some
yolande

the
days
of

my
long
and
amply
folded
skirts

i
bear

woven
for
me
my
vesture
fair
and
fine

of
sunlight
and
of
purple

no
flower
so
glorious
in
the
garden
bed
but
nature
woe
is
me
no
fragrance
shed
within
my
cup
of
orient
porcelain
well
asked
lucien
after
a
pause
immeasurably
long
as
it
seemed
to
him
my
dear
fellow
etienne
said
gravely
surveying
the
tips
of
boots
he
had
brought
the
pair
from
angouleme
and
was
wearing
them
out
my
dear
fellow
i
strongly
recommend
you
to
put
your
ink
on
your
boots
to
save
blacking
and
to
take
your
pens
for
toothpicks
so
that
when
you
come
away
from
flicoteaux
you
can
swagger
along
this
picturesque
alley
looking
as
if
you
had
dined
get
a
situation
of
any
sort
or
description
run
errands
for
a
bailiff
if
you
have
the
heart
be
a
shopman
if
your
back
is
strong
enough
enlist
if
you
happen
to
have
a
taste
for
military
music
you
have
the
stuff
of
three
poets
in
you
but
before
you
can
reach
your
public
you
will
have
time
to
die
of
starvation
six
times
over
if
you
intend
to
live
on
the
proceeds
of
your
poetry
that
is
and
from
your
too
unsophisticated
discourse
it
would
seem
to
be
your
intention
to
coin
money
out
of
your
inkstand
i
say
nothing
as
to
your
verses
they
are
a
good
deal
better
than
all
the
poetical
wares
that
are
cumbering
the
ground
in
backshops
just
now
elegant
of
that
sort
cost
a
little
more
than
the
others
because
they
are
printed
on
paper
but
they
nearly
all
of
them
come
down
at
last
to
the
banks
of
the
seine
you
may
study
their
range
of
notes
there
any
day
if
you
care
to
make
an
instructive
pilgrimage
along
the
quais
from
old
jerome
stall
by
the
pont
notre
dame
to
the
pont
royal
you
will
find
them
all
there
all
the
in
the
the
lofty
flights
the
hymns
and
songs
and
ballads
and
odes
all
the
nestfuls
hatched
during
the
last
seven
years
in
fact
there
lie
their
muses
thick
with
dust
bespattered
by
every
passing
cab
at
the
mercy
of
every
profane
hand
that
turns
them
over
to
look
at
the
vignette
on
the
you
know
nobody
you
have
access
to
no
newspaper
so
your
will
remain
demurely
folded
as
you
hold
them
now
they
will
never
open
out
to
the
sun
of
publicity
in
fair
fields
with
broad
margins
enameled
with
the
florets
which
dauriat
the
illustrious
the
king
of
the
wooden
galleries
scatters
with
a
lavish
hand
for
poets
known
to
fame
i
came
to
paris
as
you
came
poor
boy
with
a
plentiful
stock
of
illusions
impelled
by
irrepressible
longings
for
glory
and
i
found
the
realities
of
the
craft
the
practical
difficulties
of
the
trade
the
hard
facts
of
poverty
in
my
enthusiasm
it
is
kept
well
under
control
now
my
first
ebullition
of
youthful
spirits
i
did
not
see
the
social
machinery
at
work
so
i
had
to
learn
to
see
it
by
bumping
against
the
wheels
and
bruising
myself
against
the
shafts
and
chains
now
you
are
about
to
learn
as
i
learned
that
between
you
and
all
these
fair
things
lies
the
strife
of
men
and
passions
and
necessities
you
must
take
part
in
a
terrible
battle
book
against
book
man
against
man
party
against
party
make
war
you
must
and
that
systematically
or
you
will
be
abandoned
by
your
own
party
and
they
are
mean
contests
struggles
which
leave
you
disenchanted
and
wearied
and
depraved
and
all
in
pure
waste
for
it
often
happens
that
you
put
forth
all
your
strength
to
win
laurels
for
a
man
whom
you
despise
and
maintain
in
spite
of
yourself
that
some
writer
is
a
genius
there
is
a
world
behind
the
scenes
in
the
theatre
of
literature
the
public
in
front
sees
unexpected
or
success
and
applauds
the
public
does
see
the
preparations
ugly
as
they
always
are
the
painted
supers
the
hired
to
applaud
the
stage
carpenters
and
all
that
lies
behind
the
scenes
you
are
still
among
the
audience
abdicate
there
is
still
time
before
you
set
your
foot
on
the
lowest
step
of
the
throne
for
which
so
many
ambitious
spirits
are
contending
and
do
not
sell
your
honor
as
i
do
for
a
livelihood
etienne
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
he
spoke
do
you
know
how
i
make
a
living
he
continued
passionately
the
little
stock
of
money
they
gave
me
at
home
was
soon
eaten
up
a
piece
of
mine
was
accepted
at
the
just
as
i
came
to
an
end
of
it
at
the
the
influence
of
a
first
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
or
of
a
prince
of
the
blood
would
not
be
enough
to
secure
a
turn
of
favor
the
actors
only
make
concessions
to
those
who
threaten
their
if
it
is
in
your
power
to
spread
a
report
that
the
has
the
asthma
the
leading
lady
a
fistula
where
you
please
and
the
soubrette
has
foul
breath
then
your
piece
would
be
played
i
do
not
know
whether
in
two
years
time
i
who
speak
to
you
now
shall
be
in
a
position
to
exercise
such
power
you
need
so
many
to
back
you
and
where
and
how
am
i
to
gain
my
bread
meanwhile
i
tried
lots
of
things
i
wrote
a
novel
anonymously
old
doguereau
gave
me
two
hundred
francs
for
it
and
he
did
not
make
very
much
out
of
it
himself
then
it
grew
plain
to
me
that
journalism
alone
could
give
me
a
living
the
next
thing
was
to
find
my
way
into
those
shops
i
will
not
tell
you
all
the
advances
i
made
nor
how
often
i
begged
in
vain
i
will
say
nothing
of
the
six
months
i
spent
as
extra
hand
on
a
paper
and
was
told
that
i
scared
subscribers
away
when
as
a
fact
i
attracted
them
pass
over
the
insults
i
put
up
with
at
this
moment
i
am
doing
the
plays
at
the
boulevard
theatres
almost
for
a
paper
belonging
to
finot
that
stout
young
fellow
who
breakfasts
two
or
three
times
a
month
even
now
at
the
cafe
voltaire
but
you
go
there
i
live
by
selling
tickets
that
managers
give
me
to
bribe
a
good
word
in
the
paper
and
reviewers
copies
of
books
in
short
finot
once
satisfied
i
am
allowed
to
write
for
and
against
various
commercial
articles
and
i
traffic
in
tribute
paid
in
kind
by
various
tradesmen
a
facetious
notice
of
a
carminative
toilet
lotion
des
cephalic
oil
or
brazilian
mixture
brings
me
in
twenty
or
thirty
francs
i
am
obliged
to
dun
the
publishers
when
they
do
send
in
a
sufficient
number
of
reviewers
copies
finot
as
editor
appropriates
two
and
sells
them
and
i
must
have
two
to
sell
if
a
book
of
capital
importance
comes
out
and
the
publisher
is
stingy
with
copies
his
life
is
made
a
burden
to
him
the
craft
is
vile
but
i
live
by
it
and
so
do
scores
of
others
do
not
imagine
that
things
are
any
better
in
public
life
there
is
corruption
everywhere
in
both
regions
every
man
is
corrupt
or
corrupts
others
if
there
is
any
publishing
enterprise
somewhat
larger
than
usual
afoot
the
trade
will
pay
me
something
to
buy
neutrality
the
amount
of
my
income
varies
therefore
directly
with
the
prospectuses
when
prospectuses
break
out
like
a
rash
money
pours
into
my
pockets
i
stand
treat
all
round
when
trade
is
dull
i
dine
at
flicoteaux
actresses
will
pay
you
likewise
for
praise
but
the
wiser
among
them
pay
for
criticism
to
be
passed
over
in
silence
is
what
they
dread
the
most
and
the
very
best
thing
of
all
from
their
point
of
view
is
criticism
which
draws
down
a
reply
it
is
far
more
effectual
than
bald
praise
forgotten
as
soon
as
read
and
it
costs
more
in
consequence
celebrity
my
dear
fellow
is
based
upon
controversy
i
am
a
hired
bravo
i
ply
my
trade
among
ideas
and
reputations
commercial
literary
and
dramatic
i
make
some
fifty
crowns
a
month
i
can
sell
a
novel
for
five
hundred
francs
and
i
am
beginning
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
man
to
be
feared
some
day
instead
of
living
with
florine
at
the
expense
of
a
druggist
who
gives
himself
the
airs
of
a
lord
i
shall
be
in
a
house
of
my
own
i
shall
be
on
the
staff
of
a
leading
newspaper
i
shall
have
a
and
on
that
day
my
dear
fellow
florine
will
become
a
great
actress
as
for
me
i
am
not
sure
what
i
shall
be
when
that
time
comes
a
minister
or
an
honest
man
all
things
are
still
possible
he
raised
his
humiliated
head
and
looked
out
at
the
green
leaves
with
an
expression
of
despairing
dreadful
to
see
and
i
had
a
great
tragedy
accepted
he
went
on
and
among
my
papers
there
is
a
poem
which
will
die
and
i
was
a
good
fellow
and
my
heart
was
clean
i
used
to
dream
lofty
dreams
of
love
for
great
ladies
queens
in
the
great
world
and
my
mistress
is
an
actress
at
the
and
lastly
if
a
bookseller
declines
to
send
a
copy
of
a
book
to
my
paper
i
will
run
down
work
which
is
good
as
i
know
lucien
was
moved
to
tears
and
he
grasped
etienne
hand
in
his
the
journalist
rose
to
his
feet
and
the
pair
went
up
and
down
the
broad
avenue
de
as
if
their
lungs
craved
ampler
breathing
space
outside
the
world
of
letters
etienne
lousteau
continued
not
a
single
creature
suspects
that
every
one
who
succeeds
in
that
world
who
has
a
certain
vogue
that
is
to
say
or
comes
into
fashion
or
gains
reputation
or
renown
or
fame
or
favor
with
the
public
for
by
these
names
we
know
the
rungs
of
the
ladder
by
which
we
climb
to
the
higher
heights
above
and
beyond
them
every
one
who
comes
even
thus
far
is
the
hero
of
a
dreadful
odyssey
brilliant
portents
rise
above
the
mental
horizon
through
a
combination
of
a
thousand
accidents
conditions
change
so
swiftly
that
no
two
men
have
been
known
to
reach
success
by
the
same
road
canalis
and
nathan
are
two
dissimilar
cases
things
never
fall
out
in
the
same
way
twice
there
is
who
knocks
himself
to
pieces
with
work
he
will
make
a
famous
name
by
some
other
chance
this
so
much
desired
reputation
is
nearly
always
crowned
prostitution
yes
the
poorest
kind
of
literature
is
the
hapless
creature
freezing
at
the
street
corner
literature
is
the
picked
out
of
the
brothels
of
journalism
and
i
am
her
bully
lastly
there
is
lucky
literature
the
flaunting
insolent
courtesan
who
has
a
house
of
her
own
and
pays
taxes
who
receives
great
lords
treating
or
them
as
she
pleases
who
has
liveried
servants
and
a
carriage
and
can
afford
to
keep
greedy
creditors
waiting
ah
and
for
yet
others
for
me
not
so
very
long
ago
for
you
she
is
a
angel
with
wings
bearing
a
green
palm
branch
in
the
one
hand
and
in
the
other
a
flaming
sword
an
angel
something
akin
to
the
mythological
abstraction
which
lives
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
and
to
the
poor
and
honest
girl
who
lives
a
life
of
exile
in
the
outskirts
of
the
great
city
earning
every
penny
with
a
noble
fortitude
and
in
the
full
light
of
virtue
returning
to
heaven
inviolate
of
body
and
soul
unless
indeed
she
comes
to
lie
at
the
last
soiled
despoiled
polluted
and
forgotten
on
a
pauper
bier
as
for
the
men
whose
brains
are
encompassed
with
bronze
whose
hearts
are
still
warm
under
the
snows
of
experience
they
are
found
but
seldom
in
the
country
that
lies
at
our
feet
he
added
pointing
to
the
great
city
seething
in
the
late
afternoon
light
a
vision
of
and
his
friends
flashed
upon
lucien
sight
and
made
appeal
to
him
for
a
moment
but
lousteau
appalling
lamentation
carried
him
away
they
are
very
few
and
far
between
in
that
great
fermenting
vat
rare
as
love
in
rare
as
fortunes
honestly
made
in
business
rare
as
the
journalist
whose
hands
are
clean
the
experience
of
the
first
man
who
told
me
all
that
i
am
telling
you
was
thrown
away
upon
me
and
mine
no
doubt
will
be
wasted
upon
you
it
is
always
the
same
old
story
year
after
year
the
same
eager
rush
to
paris
from
the
provinces
the
same
not
to
say
a
growing
number
of
beardless
ambitious
boys
who
advance
head
erect
and
the
heart
that
princess
tourandocte
of
the
et
un
each
one
of
them
fain
to
be
her
prince
calaf
but
never
a
one
of
them
reads
the
riddle
one
by
one
they
drop
some
into
the
trench
where
failures
lie
some
into
the
mire
of
journalism
some
again
into
the
quagmires
of
the
they
pick
up
a
living
these
beggars
what
with
biographical
notices
and
scraps
of
news
for
the
papers
they
become
booksellers
hacks
for
the
dealers
in
printed
paper
who
would
sooner
take
the
rubbish
that
goes
off
in
a
fortnight
than
a
masterpiece
which
requires
time
to
sell
the
life
is
crushed
out
of
the
grubs
before
they
reach
the
butterfly
stage
they
live
by
shame
and
dishonor
they
are
ready
to
write
down
a
rising
genius
or
to
praise
him
to
the
skies
at
a
word
from
the
pasha
of
the
the
or
the
at
a
sign
from
a
publisher
at
the
request
of
a
jealous
comrade
or
as
not
seldom
happens
simply
for
a
dinner
some
surmount
the
obstacles
and
these
forget
the
misery
of
their
early
days
i
who
am
telling
you
this
have
been
putting
the
best
that
is
in
me
into
newspaper
articles
for
six
months
past
for
a
blackguard
who
gives
them
out
as
his
own
and
has
secured
a
in
another
paper
on
the
strength
of
them
he
has
not
taken
me
on
as
his
collaborator
he
has
not
give
me
so
much
as
a
piece
but
i
hold
out
a
hand
to
grasp
his
when
we
meet
i
can
not
help
myself
and
why
lucien
asked
indignantly
i
may
want
to
put
a
dozen
lines
into
his
some
day
lousteau
answered
coolly
in
short
my
dear
fellow
in
literature
you
will
not
make
money
by
hard
work
that
is
not
the
secret
of
success
the
point
is
to
exploit
the
work
of
somebody
else
a
newspaper
proprietor
is
a
contractor
we
are
the
bricklayers
the
more
mediocre
the
man
the
better
his
chance
of
getting
on
among
mediocrities
he
can
play
the
put
up
with
any
treatment
and
flatter
all
the
little
base
passions
of
the
sultans
of
literature
there
is
hector
merlin
who
came
from
limoges
a
short
time
ago
he
is
writing
political
articles
already
for
a
right
centre
daily
and
he
is
at
work
on
our
little
paper
as
well
i
have
seen
an
editor
drop
his
hat
and
merlin
pick
it
up
the
fellow
was
careful
never
to
give
offence
and
slipped
into
the
thick
of
the
fight
between
rival
ambitions
i
am
sorry
for
you
it
is
as
if
i
saw
in
you
the
self
that
i
used
to
be
and
sure
am
i
that
in
one
or
two
years
time
you
will
be
what
i
am
you
will
think
that
there
is
some
lurking
jealousy
or
personal
motive
in
this
bitter
counsel
but
it
is
prompted
by
the
despair
of
a
damned
soul
that
can
never
leave
no
one
ventures
to
utter
such
things
as
these
you
hear
the
groans
of
anguish
from
a
man
wounded
to
the
heart
crying
like
a
second
job
from
the
ashes
my
sores
but
whether
i
fight
upon
this
field
or
elsewhere
fight
i
must
said
lucien
then
be
sure
of
this
returned
lousteau
if
you
have
anything
in
you
the
war
will
know
no
truce
the
best
chance
of
success
lies
in
an
empty
head
the
austerity
of
your
conscience
clear
as
yet
will
relax
when
you
see
that
a
man
holds
your
future
in
his
two
hands
when
a
word
from
such
a
man
means
life
to
you
and
he
will
not
say
that
word
for
believe
me
the
most
brutal
bookseller
in
the
trade
is
not
so
insolent
so
to
a
newcomer
as
the
celebrity
of
the
day
the
bookseller
sees
a
possible
loss
of
money
while
the
writer
of
books
dreads
a
possible
rival
the
first
shows
you
the
door
the
second
crushes
the
life
out
of
you
to
do
really
good
work
my
boy
means
that
you
will
draw
out
the
energy
sap
and
tenderness
of
your
nature
at
every
dip
of
the
pen
in
the
ink
to
set
it
forth
for
the
world
in
passion
and
sentiment
and
phrases
yes
instead
of
acting
you
will
write
you
will
sing
songs
instead
of
fighting
you
will
love
and
hate
and
live
in
your
books
and
then
after
all
when
you
shall
have
reserved
your
riches
for
your
style
your
gold
and
purple
for
your
characters
and
you
yourself
are
walking
the
streets
of
paris
in
rags
rejoicing
in
that
rivaling
the
state
register
you
have
authorized
the
existence
of
beings
styled
adolphe
corinne
or
clarissa
rene
or
manon
when
you
shall
have
spoiled
your
life
and
your
digestion
to
give
life
to
that
creation
then
you
shall
see
it
slandered
betrayed
sold
swept
away
into
the
back
waters
of
oblivion
by
journalists
and
buried
out
of
sight
by
your
best
friends
how
can
you
afford
to
wait
until
the
day
when
your
creation
shall
rise
again
raised
from
the
dead
how
when
and
by
whom

a
magnificent
book
the

a
solitary
wanderer
in
the
desert
places
of

he
has
been
a

so
called
from
the
very
beginning
when
will
his
easter
come
who
knows
try
to
begin
with
to
find
somebody
bold
enough
to
print
the
not
to
pay
for
them
but
simply
to
print
them
and
you
will
see
some
queer
things
the
fierce
tirade
delivered
in
every
tone
of
the
passionate
feeling
which
it
expressed
fell
upon
lucien
spirit
like
an
avalanche
and
left
a
sense
of
glacial
cold
for
one
moment
he
stood
silent
then
as
he
felt
the
terrible
stimulating
charm
of
difficulty
beginning
to
work
upon
him
his
courage
blazed
up
he
grasped
lousteau
hand
i
will
triumph
he
cried
aloud

said
lucien
bring
your
manuscript
with
you
and
be
careful
of
your
dress
not
on
florine
account
but
for
the
booksellers
benefit
the
comrade
following
upon
the
poet
passionate
outcry
as
he
described
the
war
of
letters
moved
lucien
quite
as
deeply
as
grave
and
earnest
words
on
a
former
occasion
the
prospect
of
entering
at
once
upon
the
strife
with
men
warmed
him
in
his
youth
and
inexperience
he
had
no
suspicion
how
real
were
the
moral
evils
denounced
by
the
journalist
nor
did
he
know
that
he
was
standing
at
the
parting
of
two
distinct
ways
between
two
systems
represented
by
the
brotherhood
upon
one
hand
and
journalism
upon
the
other
the
first
way
was
long
honorable
and
sure
the
second
beset
with
hidden
dangers
a
perilous
path
among
muddy
channels
where
conscience
is
inevitably
bespattered
the
bent
of
lucien
character
determined
for
the
shorter
way
and
the
apparently
pleasanter
way
and
to
snatch
at
the
quickest
and
promptest
means
at
this
moment
he
saw
no
difference
between
noble
friendship
and
lousteau
easy
comaraderie
his
inconstant
mind
discerned
a
new
weapon
in
journalism
he
felt
that
he
could
wield
it
so
he
wished
to
take
it
he
was
dazzled
by
the
offers
of
this
new
friend
who
had
struck
a
hand
in
his
in
an
easy
way
which
charmed
lucien
how
should
he
know
that
while
every
man
in
the
army
of
the
press
needs
friends
every
leader
needs
men
lousteau
seeing
that
lucien
was
resolute
enlisted
him
as
a
recruit
and
hoped
to
attach
him
to
himself
the
relative
positions
of
the
two
were
similar
one
hoped
to
become
a
corporal
the
other
to
enter
the
ranks
lucien
went
back
gaily
to
his
lodgings
he
was
as
careful
over
his
toilet
as
on
that
former
unlucky
occasion
when
he
occupied
the
marquise
box
but
he
had
learned
by
this
time
how
to
wear
his
clothes
with
a
better
grace
they
looked
as
though
they
belonged
to
him
he
wore
his
best
trousers
and
a
his
boots
a
very
elegant
pair
adorned
with
tassels
had
cost
him
forty
francs
his
thick
fine
golden
hair
was
scented
and
crimped
into
bright
rippling
curls
and
belief
in
his
future
lighted
up
his
forehead
he
paid
careful
attention
to
his
almost
feminine
hands
the
filbert
nails
were
a
spotless
pink
and
the
white
contours
of
his
chin
were
dazzling
by
contrast
with
a
black
satin
stock
never
did
a
more
beautiful
youth
come
down
from
the
hills
of
the
latin
quarter
glorious
as
a
greek
god
lucien
took
a
cab
and
reached
the
cafe
servel
at
a
quarter
to
seven
there
the
portress
gave
him
some
tolerably
complicated
directions
for
the
ascent
of
four
pairs
of
stairs
provided
with
these
instructions
he
discovered
not
without
difficulty
an
open
door
at
the
end
of
a
long
dark
passage
and
in
another
moment
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
traditional
room
of
the
latin
quarter
a
young
man
poverty
follows
him
wherever
he
goes
into
the
rue
de
la
harpe
as
into
the
rue
de
cluny
into
room
into
lodging
yet
everywhere
no
less
the
poverty
has
its
own
peculiar
characteristics
due
to
the
idiosyncrasies
of
the
sufferer
poverty
in
this
case
wore
a
sinister
look
a
shabby
cheap
carpet
lay
in
wrinkles
at
the
foot
of
a
curtainless
bedstead
dingy
curtains
begrimed
with
cigar
smoke
and
fumes
from
a
smoky
chimney
hung
in
the
windows
a
carcel
lamp

on
the

so
far
escaped
the
pawnbroker
add
a
chest
of
drawers
and
a
table
littered
with
papers
and
disheveled
quill
pens
and
the
list
of
furniture
was
almost
complete
all
the
books
had
evidently
arrived
in
the
course
of
the
last
hours
and
there
was
not
a
single
object
of
any
value
in
the
room
in
one
corner
you
beheld
a
collection
of
crushed
and
flattened
cigars
coiled
shirts
which
had
been
turned
to
do
double
duty
and
cravats
that
had
reached
a
third
edition
while
a
sordid
array
of
old
boots
stood
gaping
in
another
angle
of
the
room
among
aged
socks
worn
into
lace
the
room
in
short
was
a
journalist
bivouac
filled
with
odds
and
ends
of
no
value
and
the
most
curiously
bare
apartment
imaginable
a
scarlet
glowed
among
a
pile
of
books
on
the
nightstand
a
brace
of
pistols
a
box
of
cigars
and
a
stray
razor
lay
upon
the
a
pair
of
foils
crossed
under
a
wire
mask
hung
against
a
panel
three
chairs
and
a
couple
of
armchairs
scarcely
fit
for
the
shabbiest
in
the
street
completed
the
inventory
the
dirty
cheerless
room
told
a
tale
of
a
restless
life
and
a
want
of
some
one
came
hither
to
sleep
and
work
at
high
pressure
staying
no
longer
than
he
could
help
longing
while
he
remained
to
be
out
and
away
what
a
difference
between
this
cynical
disorder
and
neat
and
poverty
a
warning
came
with
the
thought
of
but
lucien
would
not
heed
it
for
etienne
made
a
joking
remark
to
cover
the
nakedness
of
a
reckless
life
this
is
my
kennel
i
appear
in
state
in
the
rue
de
bondy
in
the
new
apartments
which
our
druggist
has
taken
for
florine
we
hold
the
this
evening
etienne
lousteau
wore
black
trousers
and
boots
his
coat
was
buttoned
up
to
his
chin
he
probably
meant
to
change
his
linen
at
florine
house
for
his
shirt
collar
was
hidden
by
a
velvet
stock
he
was
trying
to
renovate
his
hat
by
an
application
of
the
brush
let
us
go
said
lucien
not
yet
i
am
waiting
for
a
bookseller
to
bring
me
some
money
i
have
not
a
farthing
there
will
be
play
perhaps
and
in
any
case
i
must
have
gloves
as
he
spoke
the
two
new
friends
heard
a
man
step
in
the
passage
outside
there
he
is
said
lousteau
now
you
will
see
my
dear
fellow
the
shape
that
providence
takes
when
he
manifests
himself
to
poets
you
are
going
to
behold
dauriat
the
fashionable
bookseller
of
the
quai
des
augustins
the
pawnbroker
the
marine
store
dealer
of
the
trade
the
norman
come
along
old
tartar
shouted
lousteau
here
am
i
said
a
voice
like
a
cracked
bell
brought
the
money
with
you
money
there
is
no
money
now
in
the
trade
retorted
the
other
a
young
man
who
eyed
lucien
curiously
you
owe
me
fifty
francs
lousteau
continued
there
are
two
copies
of
in
here
a
marvel
so
they
say
swarming
with
woodcuts
sure
to
sell
finot
has
been
paid
for
two
reviews
that
i
am
to
write
for
him
two
works
just
out
by
victor
ducange
a
novelist
highly
thought
of
in
the
marais
a
couple
of
copies
of
a
second
work
by
paul
de
kock
a
beginner
in
the
same
style
two
copies
of
of
a
charming
provincial
work
total
one
hundred
francs
my
little
barbet
barbet
made
a
close
survey
of
edges
and
binding
oh
they
are
in
perfect
condition
cried
lousteau
the
are
uncut
so
is
the
paul
de
kock
so
is
the
ducange
so
is
that
other
thing
on
the
on
i
will
throw
that
in
myths
weary
me
to
that
degree
that
i
will
let
you
have
the
thing
to
spare
myself
the
sight
of
the
swarms
of
mites
coming
out
of
it
but
asked
lucien
how
are
you
going
to
write
your
reviews
barbet
in
profound
astonishment
stared
at
lucien
then
he
looked
at
etienne
and
chuckled
one
can
see
that
the
gentleman
has
not
the
misfortune
to
be
a
literary
man
said
he
no
barbet
no
he
is
a
poet
a
great
poet
he
is
going
to
cut
out
canalis
and
beranger
and
delavigne
he
will
go
a
long
way
if
he
does
not
throw
himself
into
the
river
and
even
so
he
will
get
as
far
as
the
at
if
i
had
any
advice
to
give
the
gentleman
remarked
barbet
it
would
be
to
give
up
poetry
and
take
to
prose
poetry
is
not
wanted
on
the
quais
just
now
barbet
shabby
overcoat
was
fastened
by
a
single
button
his
collar
was
greasy
he
kept
his
hat
on
his
head
as
he
spoke
he
wore
low
shoes
an
open
waistcoat
gave
glimpses
of
a
homely
shirt
of
coarse
linen
was
not
wanting
in
the
round
countenance
with
its
two
slits
of
covetous
eyes
but
there
was
likewise
the
vague
uneasiness
habitual
to
those
who
have
money
to
spend
and
hear
constant
applications
for
it
yet
to
all
appearance
he
was
and
his
business
shrewdness
was
so
well
wadded
round
with
fat
he
had
been
an
assistant
until
he
took
a
wretched
little
shop
on
the
quai
des
augustins
two
years
since
and
issued
thence
on
his
rounds
among
journalists
authors
and
printers
buying
up
free
copies
cheaply
making
in
such
ways
some
ten
or
twenty
francs
daily
now
he
had
money
saved
he
knew
instinctively
where
every
man
was
pressed
he
had
a
keen
eye
for
business
if
an
author
was
in
difficulties
he
would
discount
a
bill
given
by
a
publisher
at
fifteen
or
twenty
per
cent
then
the
next
day
he
would
go
to
the
publisher
haggle
over
the
price
of
some
work
in
demand
and
pay
him
with
his
own
bills
instead
of
cash
barbet
was
something
of
a
scholar
he
had
had
just
enough
education
to
make
him
careful
to
steer
clear
of
modern
poetry
and
modern
romances
he
had
a
liking
for
small
speculations
for
books
of
a
popular
kind
which
might
be
bought
outright
for
a
thousand
francs
and
exploited
at
pleasure
such
as
the
history
of
in
twenty
and
for
young
two
or
three
times
already
he
had
allowed
a
good
book
to
slip
through
his
fingers
the
authors
had
come
and
gone
a
score
of
times
while
he
hesitated
and
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
buy
the
manuscript
when
reproached
for
his
pusillanimity
he
was
wont
to
produce
the
account
of
a
notorious
trial
taken
from
the
newspapers
it
cost
him
nothing
and
had
brought
him
in
two
or
three
thousand
francs
barbet
was
the
type
of
bookseller
that
goes
in
fear
and
trembling
lives
on
bread
and
walnuts
rarely
puts
his
name
to
a
bill
filches
little
profits
on
invoices
makes
deductions
and
hawks
his
books
about
himself
heaven
only
knows
where
they
go
but
he
sells
them
somehow
and
gets
paid
for
them
barbet
was
the
terror
of
printers
who
could
not
tell
what
to
make
of
him
he
paid
cash
and
took
off
the
discount
he
nibbled
at
their
invoices
whenever
he
thought
they
were
pressed
for
money
and
when
he
had
fleeced
a
man
once
he
never
went
back
to
him
he
feared
to
be
caught
in
his
turn
well
said
lousteau
shall
we
go
on
with
our
business
eh
my
boy
returned
barbet
in
a
familiar
tone
i
have
six
thousand
volumes
of
stock
on
hand
at
my
place
and
paper
is
not
gold
as
the
old
bookseller
said
trade
is
dull
if
you
went
into
his
shop
my
dear
lucien
said
etienne
turning
to
his
friend
you
would
see
an
oak
counter
from
some
bankrupt
wine
merchant
sale
and
a
tallow
dip
never
snuffed
for
fear
it
should
burn
too
quickly
making
darkness
visible
by
that
anomalous
light
you
descry
rows
of
empty
shelves
with
some
difficulty
an
urchin
in
a
blue
blouse
mounts
guard
over
the
emptiness
and
blows
his
fingers
and
shuffles
his
feet
and
slaps
his
chest
like
a
cabman
on
the
box
just
look
about
you
there
are
no
more
books
there
than
i
have
here
nobody
could
guess
what
kind
of
shop
he
keeps
here
is
a
bill
at
three
months
for
a
hundred
francs
said
barbet
and
he
could
not
help
smiling
as
he
drew
it
out
of
his
pocket
i
will
take
your
old
books
off
your
hands
i
ca
pay
cash
any
longer
you
see
sales
are
too
slow
i
thought
that
you
would
be
wanting
me
i
had
not
a
penny
and
i
made
a
bill
simply
to
oblige
you
for
i
am
not
fond
of
giving
my
signature
so
you
want
my
thanks
and
esteem
into
the
bargain
do
you
bills
are
not
met
with
sentiment
responded
barbet
but
i
will
accept
your
esteem
all
the
same
but
i
want
gloves
and
the
perfumers
will
be
base
enough
to
decline
your
paper
said
lousteau
stop
there
is
a
superb
engraving
in
the
top
drawer
of
the
chest
there
worth
eighty
francs
proof
before
letters
and
after
letterpress
for
i
have
written
a
pretty
droll
article
upon
it
there
was
something
to
lay
hold
of
in
refusing
the
presents
of
a
fine
engraving
eh
just
the
thing
to
suit
all
the
doctors
who
are
refusing
the
extravagant
gifts
of
parisian
satraps
you
will
find
two
or
three
dozen
novels
underneath
it
come
now
take
the
lot
and
give
me
forty
francs
exclaimed
the
bookseller
emitting
a
cry
like
the
squall
of
a
frightened
fowl
twenty
at
the
very
most
and
then
i
may
never
see
the
money
again
he
added
where
are
your
twenty
francs
asked
lousteau
my
word
i
do
know
that
i
have
them
said
barbet
fumbling
in
his
pockets
here
they
are
you
are
plundering
me
you
have
an
ascendency
over
me
come
let
us
be
off
said
lousteau
and
taking
up
manuscript
he
drew
a
line
upon
it
in
ink
under
the
string
have
you
anything
else
asked
barbet
nothing
you
young
shylock
i
am
going
to
put
you
in
the
way
of
a
bit
of
very
good
business
etienne
continued
in
which
you
shall
lose
a
thousand
crowns
to
teach
you
to
rob
me
in
this
fashion
he
added
for
lucien
ear
but
how
about
your
reviews
said
lucien
as
they
rolled
away
to
the
palais
royal
pooh
you
do
not
know
how
reviews
are
knocked
off
as
for
the
in
i
looked
into
the
book
here
and
there
without
cutting
the
pages
and
i
found
eleven
slips
in
grammar
i
shall
say
that
the
writer
may
have
mastered
the
language
on
the
flints
that
they
call
out
there
in
egypt
but
he
can
not
write
in
his
own
as
i
will
prove
to
him
in
a
column
and
a
half
i
shall
say
that
instead
of
giving
us
the
natural
history
and
archaeology
he
ought
to
have
interested
himself
in
the
future
of
egypt
in
the
progress
of
civilization
and
the
best
method
of
strengthening
the
bond
between
egypt
and
france
france
has
won
and
lost
egypt
but
she
may
yet
attach
the
country
to
her
interests
by
gaining
a
moral
ascendency
over
it
then
some
patriotic
interlarded
with
diatribes
on
marseilles
the
levant
and
our
trade
but
suppose
that
he
had
taken
that
view
what
would
you
do
oh
well
i
should
say
that
instead
of
boring
us
with
politics
he
should
have
written
about
art
and
described
the
picturesque
aspects
of
the
country
and
the
local
color
then
the
critic
bewails
himself
politics
are
intruded
everywhere
we
are
weary
of
politics
politics
on
all
sides
i
should
regret
those
charming
books
of
travel
that
dwelt
upon
the
difficulties
of
navigation
the
fascination
of
steering
between
two
rocks
the
delights
of
crossing
the
line
and
all
the
things
that
those
who
never
will
travel
ought
to
know
mingle
this
approval
with
scoffing
at
the
travelers
who
hail
the
appearance
of
a
bird
or
a
as
a
great
event
who
dilate
upon
fishing
and
make
transcripts
from
the
log
where
you
ask
is
that
perfectly
unintelligible
scientific
information
fascinating
like
all
that
is
profound
mysterious
and
incomprehensible
the
reader
laughs
that
is
all
that
he
wants
as
for
novels
florine
is
the
greatest
novel
reader
alive
she
gives
me
a
synopsis
and
i
take
her
opinion
and
put
a
review
together
when
a
novelist
bores
her
with
stuff
as
she
calls
it
i
treat
the
work
respectfully
and
ask
the
publisher
for
another
copy
which
he
sends
forthwith
delighted
to
have
a
favorable
review
goodness
and
what
of
criticism
the
critic
sacred
office
cried
lucien
remembering
the
ideas
instilled
into
him
by
the
brotherhood
my
dear
fellow
said
lousteau
criticism
is
a
kind
of
brush
which
must
not
be
used
upon
flimsy
stuff
or
it
carries
it
all
away
with
it
that
is
enough
of
the
craft
now
listen
do
you
see
that
mark
he
continued
pointing
to
the
manuscript
of
the
i
have
put
ink
on
the
string
and
paper
if
dauriat
reads
your
manuscript
he
certainly
could
not
tie
the
string
and
leave
it
just
as
it
was
before
so
your
book
is
sealed
so
to
speak
this
is
not
useless
to
you
for
the
experiment
that
you
propose
to
make
and
another
thing
please
to
observe
that
you
are
not
arriving
quite
alone
and
without
a
sponsor
in
the
place
like
the
youngsters
who
make
the
round
of
of
publishers
before
they
find
one
that
will
offer
them
a
chair
lucien
experience
confirmed
the
truth
of
this
particular
lousteau
paid
the
cabman
giving
him
three
francs
a
piece
of
prodigality
following
upon
such
impecuniosity
astonishing
lucien
more
than
a
little
then
the
two
friends
entered
the
wooden
galleries
where
fashionable
literature
as
it
is
called
used
to
reign
in
state
part
ii
the
wooden
galleries
of
the
palais
royal
used
to
be
one
of
the
most
famous
sights
of
paris
some
description
of
the
squalid
bazar
will
not
be
out
of
place
for
there
are
few
men
of
forty
who
will
not
take
an
interest
in
recollections
of
a
state
of
things
which
will
seem
incredible
to
a
younger
generation
the
great
dreary
spacious
galerie
that
flowerless
hothouse
as
yet
was
not
the
space
upon
which
it
now
stands
was
covered
with
booths
or
to
be
more
precise
with
small
wooden
dens
pervious
to
the
weather
and
dimly
illuminated
on
the
side
of
the
court
and
the
garden
by
borrowed
lights
styled
windows
by
courtesy
but
more
like
the
filthiest
arrangements
for
obscuring
daylight
to
be
found
in
little
wineshops
in
the
suburbs
the
galleries
parallel
passages
about
twelve
feet
in
height
were
formed
by
a
triple
row
of
shops
the
centre
row
giving
back
and
front
upon
the
galleries
was
filled
with
the
fetid
atmosphere
of
the
place
and
derived
a
dubious
daylight
through
the
invariably
dirty
windows
of
the
roof
but
so
thronged
were
these
hives
that
rents
were
excessively
high
and
as
much
as
a
thousand
crowns
was
paid
for
a
space
scarce
six
feet
by
eight
the
outer
rows
gave
respectively
upon
the
garden
and
the
court
and
were
covered
on
that
side
by
a
slight
painted
green
to
protect
the
crazy
plastered
walls
from
continual
friction
with
the
in
a
few
square
feet
of
earth
at
the
back
of
the
shops
strange
freaks
of
vegetable
life
unknown
to
science
grew
amid
the
products
of
various
no
less
flourishing
industries
you
beheld
a
rosebush
capped
with
printed
paper
in
such
a
sort
that
the
flowers
of
rhetoric
were
perfumed
by
the
cankered
blossoms
of
that
garden
handbills
and
ribbon
streamers
of
every
hue
flaunted
gaily
among
the
leaves
natural
flowers
competed
unsuccessfully
for
an
existence
with
odds
and
ends
of
millinery
you
discovered
a
knot
of
ribbon
adorning
a
green
tuft
the
dahlia
admired
afar
proved
on
a
nearer
view
to
be
a
satin
rosette
the
palais
seen
from
the
court
or
from
the
garden
was
a
fantastic
sight
a
grotesque
combination
of
walls
of
plaster
patchwork
which
had
once
been
whitewashed
of
blistered
paint
heterogeneous
placards
and
all
the
most
unaccountable
freaks
of
parisian
squalor
the
green
trellises
were
prodigiously
the
dingier
for
constant
contact
with
a
parisian
public
so
upon
either
side
the
fetid
disreputable
approaches
might
have
been
there
for
the
express
purpose
of
warning
away
fastidious
people
but
fastidious
folk
no
more
recoiled
before
these
horrors
than
the
prince
in
the
fairy
stories
turns
tail
at
sight
of
the
dragon
or
of
the
other
obstacles
put
between
him
and
the
princess
by
the
wicked
fairy
there
was
a
passage
through
the
centre
of
the
galleries
then
as
now
and
as
at
the
present
day
you
entered
them
through
the
two
peristyles
begun
before
the
revolution
and
left
unfinished
for
lack
of
funds
but
in
place
of
the
handsome
modern
arcade
leading
to
the
you
passed
along
a
narrow
disproportionately
lofty
passage
so
that
the
rain
came
through
on
wet
days
all
the
roofs
of
the
hovels
indeed
were
in
very
bad
repair
and
covered
here
and
again
with
a
double
thickness
of
tarpaulin
a
famous
silk
mercer
once
brought
an
action
against
the
orleans
family
for
damages
done
in
the
course
of
a
night
to
his
stock
of
shawls
and
stuffs
and
gained
the
day
and
a
considerable
sum
it
was
in
this
passage
called
the
glass
gallery
to
distinguish
it
from
the
wooden
galleries
that
chevet
laid
the
foundations
of
his
fortunes
here
in
the
palais
you
trod
the
natural
soil
of
paris
augmented
by
importations
brought
in
upon
the
boots
of
foot
passengers
here
at
all
seasons
you
stumbled
among
hills
and
hollows
of
dried
mud
swept
daily
by
the
shopman
besom
and
only
after
some
practice
could
you
walk
at
your
ease
the
treacherous
the
incrusted
with
deposits
of
dust
and
rain
the
hovels
covered
with
ragged
placards
the
grimy
unfinished
walls
the
general
air
of
a
compromise
between
a
gypsy
camp
the
booths
of
a
country
fair
and
the
temporary
structures
that
we
in
paris
build
round
about
public
monuments
that
remain
unbuilt
the
grotesque
aspect
of
the
mart
as
a
whole
was
in
keeping
with
the
seething
traffic
of
various
kinds
carried
on
within
it
for
here
in
this
shameless
unblushing
haunt
amid
wild
mirth
and
a
babel
of
talk
an
immense
amount
of
business
was
transacted
between
the
revolution
of
and
the
revolution
of
for
twenty
years
the
bourse
stood
just
opposite
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
palais
public
opinion
was
manufactured
and
reputations
made
and
ruined
here
just
as
political
and
financial
jobs
were
arranged
people
made
appointments
to
meet
in
the
galleries
before
or
after
on
showery
days
the
palais
royal
was
often
crowded
with
capitalists
and
men
of
business
the
structure
which
had
grown
up
no
one
knew
how
about
this
point
was
strangely
resonant
laughter
was
multiplied
if
two
men
quarreled
the
whole
place
rang
from
one
end
to
the
other
with
the
dispute
in
the
daytime
milliners
and
booksellers
enjoyed
a
monopoly
of
the
place
towards
nightfall
it
was
filled
with
women
of
the
town
here
dwelt
poetry
politics
and
prose
new
books
and
classics
the
glories
of
ancient
and
modern
literature
side
by
side
with
political
intrigue
and
the
tricks
of
the
bookseller
trade
here
all
the
very
latest
and
newest
literature
were
sold
to
a
public
which
resolutely
decline
to
buy
elsewhere
sometimes
several
thousand
copies
of
such
and
such
a
pamphlet
by
courier
would
be
sold
in
a
single
evening
and
people
crowded
thither
to
buy
aventures
de
la
fille
that
first
shot
fired
by
the
orleanists
at
the
charter
promulgated
by
louis
xviii
when
lucien
made
his
first
appearance
in
the
wooden
galleries
some
few
of
the
shops
boasted
proper
fronts
and
handsome
windows
but
these
in
every
case
looked
upon
the
court
or
the
garden
as
for
the
centre
row
until
the
day
when
the
whole
strange
colony
perished
under
the
hammer
of
fontaine
the
architect
every
shop
was
open
back
and
front
like
a
booth
in
a
country
fair
so
that
from
within
you
could
look
out
upon
either
side
through
gaps
among
the
goods
displayed
or
through
the
glass
doors
as
it
was
obviously
impossible
to
kindle
a
fire
the
tradesmen
were
fain
to
use
charcoal
and
formed
a
sort
of
brigade
for
the
prevention
of
fires
among
themselves
and
indeed
a
little
carelessness
might
have
set
the
whole
quarter
blazing
in
fifteen
minutes
for
the
republic
dried
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
haunted
by
too
inflammable
human
material
was
bedizened
with
muslin
and
paper
and
gauze
and
ventilated
at
times
by
a
thorough
draught
the
milliners
windows
were
full
of
impossible
hats
and
bonnets
displayed
apparently
for
advertisement
rather
than
for
sale
each
on
a
separate
iron
spit
with
a
knob
at
the
top
the
galleries
were
decked
out
in
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
on
what
heads
would
those
dusty
bonnets
end
their
careers
for
a
score
of
years
the
problem
had
puzzled
frequenters
of
the
palais
saleswomen
usually
but
vivacious
waylaid
the
feminine
foot
passenger
with
cunning
importunities
after
the
fashion
of
and
using
much
the
same
language
a
who
made
free
use
of
her
eyes
and
tongue
sat
outside
on
a
stool
and
harangued
the
public
with
buy
a
pretty
bonnet
madame
do
let
me
sell
you
something
varying
a
rich
and
picturesque
vocabulary
with
inflections
of
the
voice
with
glances
and
remarks
upon
the
booksellers
and
milliners
lived
on
terms
of
mutual
understanding
but
it
was
in
the
passage
known
by
the
pompous
title
of
the
glass
gallery
that
the
oddest
trades
were
carried
on
here
were
ventriloquists
and
charlatans
of
every
sort
and
sights
of
every
description
from
the
kind
where
there
is
nothing
to
see
to
panoramas
of
the
globe
one
man
who
has
since
made
seven
or
eight
hundred
thousand
francs
by
traveling
from
fair
to
fair
began
here
by
hanging
out
a
signboard
a
revolving
sun
in
a
blackboard
and
the
inscription
in
red
letters
here
man
may
see
what
god
can
never
see
admittance
two
sous
the
showman
at
the
door
never
admitted
one
person
alone
nor
more
than
two
at
a
time
once
inside
you
confronted
a
great
and
a
voice
which
might
have
terrified
hoffmann
of
berlin
suddenly
spoke
as
if
some
spring
had
been
touched
you
see
here
gentlemen
something
that
god
can
never
see
through
all
eternity
that
is
to
say
your
like
god
has
not
his
like
and
out
you
went
too
shamefaced
to
confess
to
your
stupidity
voices
issued
from
every
narrow
doorway
crying
up
the
merits
of
cosmoramas
views
of
constantinople
marionettes
automatic
and
performing
dogs
who
would
pick
you
out
the
prettiest
woman
in
the
company
the
ventriloquist
flourished
here
in
the
cafe
borel
before
he
went
to
fight
and
fall
at
montmartre
with
the
young
lads
from
the
ecole
polytechnique
here
too
there
were
fruit
and
flower
shops
and
a
famous
tailor
whose
uniforms
shone
like
the
sun
when
the
shops
were
lighted
at
night
of
a
morning
the
galleries
were
empty
dark
and
deserted
the
shopkeepers
chatted
among
themselves
towards
two
in
the
afternoon
the
palais
began
to
fill
at
three
men
came
in
from
the
bourse
and
paris
generally
speaking
crowded
the
place
impecunious
youth
hungering
after
literature
took
the
opportunity
of
turning
over
the
pages
of
the
books
exposed
for
sale
on
the
stalls
outside
the
booksellers
shops
the
men
in
charge
charitably
allowed
a
poor
student
to
pursue
his
course
of
free
studies
and
in
this
way
a
duodecimo
volume
of
some
two
hundred
pages
such
as
or
or
or
might
be
devoured
in
a
couple
of
afternoons
there
was
something
very
french
in
this
alms
given
to
the
young
hungry
starved
intellect
circulating
libraries
were
not
as
yet
if
you
wished
to
read
a
book
you
were
obliged
to
buy
it
for
which
reason
novels
of
the
early
part
of
the
century
were
sold
in
numbers
which
now
seem
fabulous
to
us
but
the
poetry
of
this
terrible
mart
appeared
in
all
its
splendor
at
the
close
of
the
day
women
of
the
town
flocking
in
and
out
from
the
neighboring
streets
were
allowed
to
make
a
promenade
of
the
wooden
galleries
thither
came
prostitutes
from
every
quarter
of
paris
to
do
the
palais
the
stone
galleries
belonged
to
privileged
houses
which
paid
for
the
right
of
exposing
women
dressed
like
princesses
under
such
and
such
an
arch
or
in
the
corresponding
space
of
garden
but
the
wooden
galleries
were
the
common
ground
of
women
of
the
streets
this
was
palais
a
word
which
used
to
signify
the
temple
of
prostitution
a
woman
might
come
and
go
taking
away
her
prey
whithersoever
seemed
good
to
her
so
great
was
the
crowd
attracted
thither
at
night
by
the
women
that
it
was
impossible
to
move
except
at
a
slow
pace
as
in
a
procession
or
at
a
masked
ball
nobody
objected
to
the
slowness
it
facilitated
examination
the
women
dressed
in
a
way
that
is
never
seen
nowadays
the
bodices
cut
extremely
low
both
back
and
front
the
fantastical
designed
to
attract
notice
here
a
cap
from
the
pays
de
caux
and
there
a
spanish
mantilla
the
hair
crimped
and
curled
like
a
poodle
or
smoothed
down
in
bandeaux
over
the
forehead
the
white
stockings
and
limbs
revealed
it
would
not
be
easy
to
say
how
but
always
at
the
right
moment
all
this
poetry
of
vice
has
fled
the
license
of
question
and
reply
the
public
cynicism
in
keeping
with
the
haunt
is
now
unknown
even
at
masquerades
or
the
famous
public
balls
it
was
an
appalling
gay
scene
the
dazzling
white
flesh
of
the
women
necks
and
shoulders
stood
out
in
magnificent
contrast
against
the
men
almost
invariably
sombre
costumes
the
murmur
of
voices
the
hum
of
the
crowd
could
be
heard
even
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
as
a
sort
of
droning
bass
interspersed
with
of
shrill
laughter
or
clamor
of
some
rare
dispute
you
saw
gentlemen
and
celebrities
cheek
by
jowl
with
there
was
something
indescribably
piquant
about
the
anomalous
assemblage
the
most
insensible
of
men
felt
its
charm
so
much
so
that
until
the
very
last
moment
paris
came
hither
to
walk
up
and
down
on
the
wooden
planks
laid
over
the
cellars
where
men
were
at
work
on
the
new
buildings
and
when
the
squalid
wooden
erections
were
finally
taken
down
great
and
unanimous
regret
was
felt
ladvocat
the
bookseller
had
opened
a
shop
but
a
few
days
since
in
the
angle
formed
by
the
central
passage
which
crossed
the
galleries
and
immediately
opposite
another
bookseller
now
forgotten
dauriat
a
bold
and
youthful
pioneer
who
opened
up
the
paths
in
which
his
rival
was
to
shine
dauriat
shop
stood
in
the
row
which
gave
upon
the
garden
ladvocat
on
the
opposite
side
looked
out
upon
the
court
dauriat
establishment
was
divided
into
two
parts
his
shop
was
simply
a
great
trade
warehouse
and
the
second
room
was
his
private
office
lucien
on
this
first
visit
to
the
wooden
galleries
was
bewildered
by
a
sight
which
no
novice
can
resist
he
soon
lost
the
guide
who
befriended
him
if
you
were
as
as
yonder
young
fellow
i
would
give
you
your
money
worth
a
woman
said
pointing
out
lucien
to
an
old
man
lucien
slunk
through
the
crowd
like
a
blind
man
dog
following
the
stream
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
and
excitement
difficult
to
describe
importuned
by
glances
and
contours
dazzled
by
the
audacious
display
of
bared
throat
and
bosom
he
gripped
his
roll
of
manuscript
tightly
lest
somebody
should
steal
it
innocent
that
he
was
well
what
is
it
sir
he
exclaimed
thinking
when
some
one
caught
him
by
the
arm
that
his
poetry
had
proved
too
great
a
temptation
to
some
author
honesty
and
turning
he
recognized
lousteau
i
felt
sure
that
you
would
find
your
way
here
at
last
said
his
friend
the
poet
was
standing
in
the
doorway
of
a
shop
crowded
with
persons
waiting
for
an
audience
with
the
sultan
of
the
publishing
trade
printers
and
designers
were
catechizing
assistants
as
to
present
or
future
business
lousteau
drew
lucien
into
the
shop
there
that
is
finot
who
edits
my
paper
he
said
he
is
talking
with
felicien
vernou
who
has
abilities
but
the
little
wretch
is
as
dangerous
as
a
hidden
disease
well
old
boy
there
is
a
first
night
for
you
said
finot
coming
up
with
vernou
i
have
disposed
of
the
box
sold
it
to
braulard
well
and
if
i
did
what
then
you
will
get
a
seat
what
do
you
want
with
dauriat
oh
it
is
agreed
that
we
are
to
push
paul
de
kock
dauriat
has
taken
two
hundred
copies
and
victor
ducange
is
refusing
to
give
him
his
next
dauriat
wants
to
set
up
another
man
in
the
same
line
he
says
you
must
rate
paul
de
kock
above
ducange
but
i
have
a
piece
on
with
ducange
at
the
gaite
said
lousteau
very
well
tell
him
that
i
wrote
the
article
it
can
be
supposed
that
i
wrote
a
slashing
review
and
you
toned
it
down
and
he
will
owe
you
thanks
could
you
get
dauriat
cashier
to
discount
this
bit
of
a
bill
for
a
hundred
francs
asked
etienne
lousteau
we
are
celebrating
florine
with
a
supper
you
know
ah
yes
you
are
treating
us
all
said
finot
with
an
apparent
effort
of
memory
here
gabusson
he
added
handing
barbet
bill
to
the
cashier
let
me
have
ninety
francs
for
this
fill
in
your
name
old
man
lousteau
signed
his
name
while
the
cashier
counted
out
the
money
and
lucien
all
eyes
and
ears
lost
not
a
syllable
of
the
conversation
that
is
not
all
my
friend
etienne
continued
i
do
thank
you
we
have
sworn
an
eternal
friendship
i
have
taken
it
upon
myself
to
introduce
this
gentleman
to
dauriat
and
you
must
incline
his
ear
to
listen
to
us
what
is
on
foot
asked
finot
a
volume
of
poetry
said
lucien
oh
said
finot
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
your
acquaintance
can
not
have
had
much
to
do
with
publishers
or
he
would
have
hidden
his
manuscript
in
the
loneliest
spot
in
his
dwelling
remarked
vernou
looking
at
lucien
as
he
spoke
just
at
that
moment
a
young
man
came
into
the
shop
gave
a
hand
to
finot
and
lousteau
and
nodded
slightly
to
vernou
the
newcomer
was
emile
blondet
who
had
made
his
first
appearance
in
the
des
with
articles
revealing
capacities
of
the
very
highest
order
come
and
have
supper
with
us
at
midnight
at
florine
said
lousteau
very
good
said
the
newcomer
but
who
is
going
to
be
there
oh
florine
and
matifat
the
druggist
said
lousteau
and
du
bruel
the
author
who
gave
florine
the
part
in
which
she
is
to
make
her
first
appearance
a
little
old
fogy
named
cardot
and
his
camusot
and
finot
and
does
your
druggist
do
things
properly
he
will
not
give
us
doctored
wine
said
lucien
you
are
very
witty
monsieur
blondet
returned
gravely
is
he
coming
lousteau
yes
then
we
shall
have
some
fun
lucien
had
flushed
red
to
the
tips
of
his
ears
blondet
tapped
on
the
window
above
dauriat
desk
is
your
business
likely
to
keep
you
long
dauriat
i
am
at
your
service
my
friend
that
right
said
lousteau
addressing
his
protege
that
young
fellow
is
hardly
any
older
than
you
are
and
he
is
on
the
he
is
one
of
the
princes
of
criticism
they
are
afraid
of
him
dauriat
will
fawn
upon
him
and
then
we
can
put
in
a
word
about
our
business
with
the
pasha
of
vignettes
and
type
otherwise
we
might
have
waited
till
eleven
and
our
turn
would
not
have
come
the
crowd
of
people
waiting
to
speak
with
dauriat
is
growing
bigger
every
moment
lucien
and
lousteau
followed
blondet
finot
and
vernou
and
stood
in
a
knot
at
the
back
of
the
shop
what
is
he
doing
asked
blondet
of
the
who
rose
to
bid
him
he
is
buying
a
weekly
newspaper
he
wants
to
put
new
life
into
it
and
set
up
a
rival
to
the
and
the
eymery
has
rather
too
much
of
his
own
way
in
the
and
the
is
too
blindly
romantic
is
he
going
to
pay
well
only
too
much
as
usual
said
the
cashier
just
as
he
spoke
another
young
man
entered
this
was
the
writer
of
a
magnificent
novel
which
had
sold
very
rapidly
and
met
with
the
greatest
possible
success
dauriat
was
bringing
out
a
second
edition
the
appearance
of
this
odd
and
extraordinary
looking
being
so
unmistakably
an
artist
made
a
deep
impression
on
lucien
mind
that
is
nathan
lousteau
said
in
his
ear
nathan
then
in
the
prime
of
his
youth
came
up
to
the
group
of
journalists
hat
in
hand
and
in
spite
of
his
look
of
fierce
pride
he
was
almost
humble
to
blondet
whom
as
yet
he
only
knew
by
sight
blondet
did
not
remove
his
hat
neither
did
finot
monsieur
i
am
delighted
to
avail
myself
of
an
opportunity
yielded
by
chance
he
is
so
nervous
that
he
is
committing
a
pleonasm
said
felicien
in
an
aside
to
lousteau
to
give
expression
to
my
gratitude
for
the
splendid
review
which
you
were
so
good
as
to
give
me
in
the
des
half
the
success
of
my
book
is
owing
to
you
no
my
dear
fellow
no
said
blondet
with
an
air
of
patronage
scarcely
masked
by
you
have
talent
the
deuce
you
have
and
i
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
now
that
your
review
has
appeared
i
shall
not
seem
to
be
courting
power
we
can
feel
at
ease
will
you
do
me
the
honor
and
the
pleasure
of
dining
with
me
finot
is
lousteau
old
man
you
will
not
refuse
me
will
you
added
nathan
shaking
etienne
by
the
ah
you
are
on
the
way
to
a
great
future
monsieur
he
added
turning
again
to
blondet
you
will
carry
on
the
line
of
dussaults
fievees
and
geoffrois
hoffmann
was
talking
about
you
to
a
friend
of
mine
claude
vignon
his
pupil
he
said
that
he
could
die
in
peace
the
des
would
live
forever
they
ought
to
pay
you
tremendously
well
a
hundred
francs
a
column
said
blondet
poor
pay
when
one
is
obliged
to
read
the
books
and
read
a
hundred
before
you
find
one
worth
interesting
yourself
in
like
yours
your
work
gave
me
pleasure
upon
my
word
and
brought
him
in
fifteen
hundred
francs
said
lousteau
for
lucien
benefit
but
you
write
political
articles
do
you
asked
nathan
yes
now
and
again
lucien
felt
like
an
embryo
among
these
men
he
had
admired
book
he
had
reverenced
the
author
as
an
immortal
nathan
abject
attitude
before
this
critic
whose
name
and
importance
were
both
unknown
to
him
stupefied
lucien
how
if
i
should
come
to
behave
as
he
does
he
thought
is
a
man
obliged
to
part
with
his
pray
put
on
your
hat
again
nathan
you
have
written
a
great
book
and
the
critic
has
only
written
a
review
of
it
these
thoughts
set
the
blood
tingling
in
his
veins
scarce
a
minute
passed
but
some
young
author
and
shy
came
in
asked
to
speak
with
dauriat
looked
round
the
crowded
shop
despairingly
and
went
out
saying
i
will
come
back
again
two
or
three
politicians
were
chatting
over
the
convocation
of
the
chambers
and
public
business
with
a
group
of
public
men
the
weekly
newspaper
for
which
dauriat
was
in
treaty
was
licensed
to
treat
of
matters
political
and
the
number
of
newspapers
suffered
to
exist
was
growing
smaller
and
smaller
till
a
paper
was
a
piece
of
property
as
much
in
demand
as
a
theatre
one
of
the
largest
shareholders
in
the
was
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
knot
of
political
celebrities
lousteau
performed
the
part
of
cicerone
to
admiration
with
every
sentence
he
uttered
dauriat
rose
higher
in
lucien
opinion
politics
and
literature
seemed
to
converge
in
dauriat
shop
he
had
seen
a
great
poet
prostituting
his
muse
to
journalism
humiliating
art
as
woman
was
humiliated
and
prostituted
in
those
shameless
galleries
without
and
the
provincial
took
a
terrible
lesson
to
heart
money
that
was
the
key
to
every
enigma
lucien
realized
the
fact
that
he
was
unknown
and
alone
and
that
the
fragile
clue
of
an
uncertain
friendship
was
his
sole
guide
to
success
and
fortune
he
blamed
the
kind
and
loyal
little
circle
for
painting
the
world
for
him
in
false
colors
for
preventing
him
from
plunging
into
the
arena
pen
in
hand
i
should
be
a
blondet
at
this
moment
he
exclaimed
within
himself
only
a
little
while
ago
they
had
sat
looking
out
over
paris
from
the
gardens
of
the
luxembourg
and
lousteau
had
uttered
the
cry
of
a
wounded
eagle
then
lousteau
had
been
a
great
man
in
lucien
eyes
and
now
he
had
shrunk
to
scarce
visible
proportions
the
really
important
man
for
him
at
this
moment
was
the
fashionable
bookseller
by
whom
all
these
men
lived
and
the
poet
manuscript
in
hand
felt
a
nervous
tremor
that
was
almost
like
fear
he
noticed
a
group
of
busts
mounted
on
wooden
pedestals
painted
to
resemble
marble
byron
stood
there
and
goethe
and
de
canalis
dauriat
was
hoping
to
publish
a
volume
by
the
poet
who
might
see
on
his
entrance
into
the
shop
the
estimation
in
which
he
was
held
by
the
trade
unconsciously
lucien
own
began
to
shrink
and
his
courage
ebbed
he
began
to
see
how
large
a
part
this
dauriat
would
play
in
his
destinies
and
waited
impatiently
for
him
to
appear
well
children
said
a
voice
and
a
short
stout
man
appeared
with
a
puffy
face
that
suggested
a
roman
visage
mellowed
by
an
air
of
which
deceived
superficial
observers
well
children
here
am
i
the
proprietor
of
the
only
weekly
paper
in
the
market
a
paper
with
two
thousand
subscribers
old
joker
the
registered
number
is
seven
hundred
and
that
is
over
the
mark
said
blondet
twelve
thousand
on
my
sacred
word
of
honor
i
said
two
thousand
for
the
benefit
of
the
printers
and
yonder
he
added
lowering
his
voice
then
raising
it
again
i
thought
you
had
more
tact
my
boy
he
added
are
you
going
to
take
any
partners
inquired
finot
that
depends
said
dauriat
will
you
take
a
third
at
forty
thousand
francs
it
a
bargain
if
you
will
take
emile
blondet
here
on
the
staff
and
claude
vignon
scribe
theodore
leclercq
felicien
vernou
jay
jouy
lousteau
and
and
why
not
lucien
de
rubempre
the
provincial
poet
put
in
and
nathan
concluded
finot
why
not
the
people
out
there
in
the
street
asked
dauriat
scowling
at
the
author
of
the
to
whom
have
i
the
honor
of
speaking
he
added
with
an
insolent
glance
one
moment
dauriat
said
lousteau
i
have
brought
this
gentleman
to
you
listen
to
me
while
finot
is
thinking
over
your
proposals
lucien
watched
this
dauriat
who
addressed
finot
with
the
familiar
tu
which
even
finot
did
not
permit
himself
to
use
in
reply
who
called
the
redoubtable
blondet
my
boy
and
extended
a
hand
royally
to
nathan
with
a
friendly
nod
the
provincial
poet
felt
his
shirt
wet
with
perspiration
when
the
formidable
sultan
looked
indifferent
and
ill
pleased
another
piece
of
business
my
boy
exclaimed
dauriat
why
i
have
eleven
hundred
manuscripts
on
hand
as
you
know
yes
gentlemen
i
have
eleven
hundred
manuscripts
submitted
to
me
at
this
moment
ask
gabusson
i
shall
soon
be
obliged
to
start
a
department
to
keep
account
of
the
stock
of
manuscripts
and
a
special
office
for
reading
them
and
a
committee
to
vote
on
their
merits
with
numbered
counters
for
those
who
attend
and
a
permanent
secretary
to
draw
up
the
minutes
for
me
it
will
be
a
kind
of
local
branch
of
the
academie
and
the
academicians
will
be
better
paid
in
the
wooden
galleries
than
at
the
institut
is
an
idea
said
blondet
a
bad
idea
returned
dauriat
it
is
not
my
business
to
take
stock
of
the
lucubrations
of
those
among
you
who
take
to
literature
because
they
can
not
be
capitalists
and
there
is
no
opening
for
them
as
bootmakers
nor
corporals
nor
domestic
servants
nor
officials
nor
bailiffs
nobody
comes
here
until
he
has
made
a
name
for
himself
make
a
name
for
yourself
and
you
will
find
gold
in
torrents
i
have
made
three
great
men
in
the
last
two
years
and
lo
and
behold
three
examples
of
ingratitude
here
is
nathan
talking
of
six
thousand
francs
for
the
second
edition
of
his
book
which
cost
me
three
thousand
francs
in
reviews
and
has
not
brought
in
a
thousand
yet
i
paid
a
thousand
francs
for
blondet
two
articles
besides
a
dinner
which
cost
me
five
hundred
but
if
all
booksellers
talked
as
you
do
sir
how
could
a
man
publish
his
first
book
at
all
asked
lucien
blondet
had
gone
down
tremendously
in
his
opinion
since
he
had
heard
the
amount
given
by
dauriat
for
the
articles
in
the
that
is
not
my
affair
said
dauriat
looking
daggers
at
this
handsome
young
fellow
who
was
smiling
pleasantly
at
him
i
do
not
publish
books
for
amusement
nor
risk
two
thousand
francs
for
the
sake
of
seeing
my
money
back
again
i
speculate
in
literature
and
publish
forty
volumes
of
ten
thousand
copies
each
just
as
panckouke
does
and
the
baudoins
with
my
influence
and
the
articles
which
i
secure
i
can
push
a
business
of
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
instead
of
a
single
volume
involving
a
couple
of
thousand
francs
it
is
just
as
much
trouble
to
bring
out
a
new
name
and
to
induce
the
public
to
take
up
an
author
and
his
book
as
to
make
a
success
with
the
et
or
sur
la
books
that
bring
in
a
fortune
i
am
not
here
as
a
to
future
fame
but
to
make
money
and
to
find
it
for
men
with
distinguished
names
the
manuscripts
for
which
i
give
a
hundred
thousand
francs
pay
me
better
than
work
by
an
unknown
author
who
asks
six
hundred
if
i
am
not
exactly
a
maecenas
i
deserve
the
gratitude
of
literature
i
have
doubled
the
prices
of
manuscripts
i
am
giving
you
this
explanation
because
you
are
a
friend
of
lousteau
my
boy
added
dauriat
clapping
lucien
on
the
shoulder
with
odious
familiarity
if
i
were
to
talk
to
all
the
authors
who
have
a
mind
that
i
should
be
their
publisher
i
should
have
to
shut
up
shop
i
should
pass
my
time
very
agreeably
no
doubt
but
the
conversations
would
cost
too
much
i
am
not
rich
enough
yet
to
listen
to
all
the
monologues
of
nobody
does
except
in
classical
tragedies
on
the
stage
the
terrible
dauriat
gorgeous
raiment
seemed
in
the
provincial
poet
eyes
to
add
force
to
the
man
remorseless
logic
what
is
it
about
he
continued
addressing
lucien
protector
it
is
a
volume
of
magnificent
poetry
at
that
word
dauriat
turned
to
gabusson
with
a
gesture
worthy
of
talma
gabusson
my
friend
he
said
from
this
day
forward
when
anybody
begins
to
talk
of
works
in
manuscript
here
do
you
hear
that
all
of
you
he
broke
in
upon
himself
and
three
assistants
at
once
emerged
from
among
the
piles
of
books
at
the
sound
of
their
wrathful
voice
if
anybody
comes
here
with
manuscripts
he
continued
looking
at
the
of
a
hand
ask
him
whether
it
is
poetry
or
prose
and
if
he
says
poetry
show
him
the
door
at
once
verses
mean
reverses
in
the
booktrade
bravo
well
put
dauriat
cried
the
chorus
of
journalists
it
is
true
cried
the
bookseller
striding
about
his
shop
with
lucien
manuscript
in
his
hand
you
have
no
idea
gentlemen
of
the
amount
of
harm
that
byron
lamartine
victor
hugo
casimir
delavigne
canalis
and
beranger
have
done
by
their
success
the
fame
of
them
has
brought
down
an
invasion
of
barbarians
upon
us
i
know
there
are
a
thousand
volumes
of
manuscript
poetry
going
the
round
of
the
publishers
at
this
moment
things
that
nobody
can
make
head
nor
tail
of
stories
in
verse
that
begin
in
the
middle
like
and
they
set
up
to
be
original
forsooth
and
indulge
in
stanzas
that
nobody
can
understand
and
descriptive
poetry
after
the
pattern
of
the
younger
men
who
discovered
delille
and
imagine
that
they
are
doing
something
new
poets
have
been
swarming
like
cockchafers
for
two
years
past
i
have
lost
twenty
thousand
francs
through
poetry
in
the
last
twelvemonth
you
ask
gabusson
there
may
be
immortal
poets
somewhere
in
the
world
i
know
of
some
that
are
blooming
and
rosy
and
have
no
beards
on
their
chins
as
yet
he
continued
looking
at
lucien
but
in
the
trade
young
man
there
are
only
four
poets
beranger
casimir
delavigne
lamartine
and
victor
hugo
as
for
canalis
he
is
a
poet
made
by
sheer
force
of
writing
him
up
lucien
felt
that
he
lacked
the
courage
to
hold
up
his
head
and
show
his
spirit
before
all
these
influential
persons
who
were
laughing
with
all
their
might
he
knew
very
well
that
he
should
look
hopelessly
ridiculous
and
yet
he
felt
consumed
by
a
fierce
desire
to
catch
the
bookseller
by
the
throat
to
ruffle
the
insolent
composure
of
his
cravat
to
break
the
gold
chain
that
glittered
on
the
man
chest
trample
his
watch
under
his
feet
and
tear
him
in
pieces
mortified
vanity
opened
the
door
to
thoughts
of
vengeance
and
inwardly
he
swore
eternal
enmity
to
that
bookseller
but
he
smiled
amiably
poetry
is
like
the
sun
said
blondet
giving
life
alike
to
primeval
forests
and
to
ants
and
gnats
and
mosquitoes
there
is
no
virtue
but
has
a
vice
to
match
and
literature
breeds
the
publisher
and
the
journalist
said
lousteau
dauriat
burst
out
laughing
what
is
this
after
all
he
asked
holding
up
the
manuscript
a
volume
of
sonnets
that
will
put
petrarch
to
the
blush
said
lousteau
what
do
you
mean
just
what
i
say
answered
lousteau
seeing
the
knowing
smile
that
went
round
the
group
lucien
could
not
take
offence
but
he
chafed
inwardly
very
well
i
will
read
them
said
dauriat
with
a
regal
gesture
that
marked
the
full
extent
of
the
concession
if
these
sonnets
of
yours
are
up
to
the
level
of
the
nineteenth
century
i
will
make
a
great
poet
of
you
my
boy
if
he
has
brains
to
equal
his
good
looks
you
will
run
no
great
risks
remarked
one
of
the
greatest
public
speakers
of
the
day
a
deputy
who
was
chatting
with
the
editor
of
the
and
a
writer
for
the
fame
means
twelve
thousand
francs
in
reviews
and
a
thousand
more
for
dinners
general
said
dauriat
if
benjamin
de
constant
means
to
write
a
paper
on
this
young
poet
it
will
not
be
long
before
i
make
a
bargain
with
him
at
the
title
of
general
and
the
distinguished
name
of
benjamin
constant
the
bookseller
shop
took
the
proportions
of
olympus
for
the
provincial
great
man
lousteau
i
want
a
word
with
you
said
finot
but
i
shall
see
you
again
later
at
the
dauriat
i
will
take
your
offer
but
on
conditions
let
us
step
into
your
office
come
in
my
boy
answered
dauriat
allowing
finot
to
pass
before
him
then
intimating
to
some
ten
persons
still
waiting
for
him
that
he
was
engaged
he
likewise
was
about
to
disappear
when
lucien
impatiently
stopped
him
you
are
keeping
my
manuscript
when
shall
i
have
an
answer
oh
come
back
in
three
or
four
days
my
little
poet
and
we
will
see
lousteau
hurried
lucien
away
he
had
not
time
to
take
leave
of
vernou
and
blondet
and
raoul
nathan
nor
to
salute
general
foy
nor
benjamin
constant
whose
book
on
the
hundred
days
was
just
about
to
appear
lucien
scarcely
caught
a
glimpse
of
fair
hair
a
refined
face
keen
eyes
and
the
mouth
belonging
to
the
man
who
had
played
the
part
of
a
potemkin
to
mme
de
stael
for
twenty
years
and
now
was
at
war
with
the
bourbons
as
he
had
been
at
war
with
napoleon
he
was
destined
to
win
his
cause
and
to
die
stricken
to
earth
by
his
victory
what
a
shop
exclaimed
lucien
as
he
took
his
place
in
the
cab
beside
lousteau
to
the
look
sharp
and
you
shall
have
thirty
sous
etienne
lousteau
called
to
the
dauriat
is
a
rascal
who
sells
books
to
the
amount
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
hundred
thousand
francs
every
year
he
is
a
kind
of
minister
of
literature
lousteau
continued
his
had
been
pleasantly
tickled
and
he
was
showing
off
before
lucien
dauriat
is
just
as
grasping
as
barbet
but
it
is
on
a
wholesale
scale
dauriat
can
be
civil
and
he
is
generous
but
he
has
a
great
opinion
of
himself
as
for
his
wit
it
consists
in
a
faculty
for
picking
up
all
that
he
hears
and
his
shop
is
a
capital
place
to
frequent
you
meet
all
the
best
men
at
dauriat
a
young
fellow
learns
more
there
in
an
hour
than
by
poring
over
books
for
of
years
people
talk
about
articles
and
concoct
subjects
you
make
the
acquaintance
of
great
or
influential
people
who
may
be
useful
to
you
you
must
know
people
if
you
mean
to
get
on
it
is
all
luck
you
see
and
as
for
sitting
by
yourself
in
a
corner
alone
with
your
intellect
it
is
the
most
dangerous
thing
of
all
but
what
insolence
said
lucien
pshaw
we
all
of
us
laugh
at
dauriat
said
etienne
if
you
are
in
need
of
him
he
tramples
upon
you
if
he
has
need
of
the
des
emile
blondet
sets
him
spinning
like
a
top
oh
if
you
take
to
literature
you
will
see
a
good
many
queer
things
well
what
was
i
telling
you
eh
yes
you
were
right
said
lucien
my
experience
in
that
shop
was
even
more
painful
than
i
expected
after
your
programme
why
do
you
choose
to
suffer
you
find
your
subject
you
wear
out
your
wits
over
it
with
toiling
at
night
you
throw
your
very
life
into
it
and
after
all
your
journeyings
in
the
fields
of
thought
the
monument
reared
with
your
is
simply
a
good
or
a
bad
speculation
for
a
publisher
your
work
will
sell
or
it
will
not
sell
and
therein
for
them
lies
the
whole
question
a
book
means
so
much
capital
to
risk
and
the
better
the
book
the
less
likely
it
is
to
sell
a
man
of
talent
rises
above
the
level
of
ordinary
heads
his
success
varies
in
direct
ratio
with
the
time
required
for
his
work
to
be
appreciated
and
no
publisher
wants
to
wait
book
must
be
sold
by
acting
on
this
system
publishers
and
booksellers
do
not
care
to
take
real
literature
books
that
call
for
the
high
praise
that
comes
slowly
was
right
exclaimed
lucien
do
you
know
asked
lousteau
i
know
of
no
more
dangerous
company
than
solitary
spirits
like
that
fellow
yonder
who
fancy
that
they
can
draw
the
world
after
them
all
of
us
begin
by
thinking
that
we
are
capable
of
great
things
and
when
once
a
youthful
imagination
is
heated
by
this
superstition
the
candidate
for
posthumous
honors
makes
no
attempt
to
move
the
world
while
such
moving
of
the
world
is
both
possible
and
profitable
he
lets
the
time
go
by
i
am
for

system
if
the
mountain
does
not
come
to
me
i
am
for
going
to
the
mountain
the
so
trenchantly
put
in
this
sally
left
lucien
halting
between
the
resignation
preached
by
the
brotherhood
and
militant
doctrine
he
said
not
a
word
till
they
reached
the
boulevard
du
temple
the
no
longer
exists
a
stands
on
the
site
of
the
once
charming
theatre
in
the
boulevard
du
temple
where
two
successive
managements
collapsed
without
making
a
single
hit
and
yet
vignol
who
has
since
fallen
heir
to
some
of
popularity
made
his
there
and
florine
five
years
later
a
celebrated
actress
made
her
first
appearance
in
the
theatre
opposite
the
rue
charlot
like
men
have
their
vicissitudes
the
suffered
from
competition
the
machinations
of
its
rivals
the
ambigu
the
gaite
the
porte
and
the
vaudeville
together
with
a
plethora
of
restrictions
and
a
scarcity
of
good
plays
combined
to
bring
about
the
downfall
of
the
house
no
dramatic
author
cared
to
quarrel
with
a
prosperous
theatre
for
the
sake
of
the
whose
existence
was
to
say
the
least
problematical
the
management
at
this
moment
however
was
counting
on
the
success
of
a
new
melodramatic
comedy
by
du
bruel
a
young
author
who
after
working
in
collaboration
with
divers
celebrities
had
now
produced
a
piece
professedly
entirely
his
own
it
had
been
specially
composed
for
the
leading
lady
a
young
actress
who
began
her
stage
career
as
a
supernumerary
at
the
gaite
and
had
been
promoted
to
small
parts
for
the
last
twelvemonth
but
though
mlle
florine
acting
had
attracted
some
attention
she
obtained
no
engagement
and
the
panorama
accordingly
had
carried
her
off
coralie
another
actress
was
to
make
her
at
the
same
time
lucien
was
amazed
at
the
power
wielded
by
the
press
this
gentleman
is
with
me
said
etienne
lousteau
and
the
clerks
bowed
before
him
as
one
man
you
will
find
it
no
easy
matter
to
get
seats
said
the
there
is
nothing
left
now
but
the
stage
box
a
certain
amount
of
time
was
wasted
in
controversies
with
the
in
the
lobbies
when
etienne
said
let
us
go
behind
the
scenes
we
will
speak
to
the
manager
he
will
take
us
into
the
and
besides
i
will
introduce
you
to
florine
the
heroine
of
the
evening
at
a
sign
from
etienne
lousteau
the
doorkeeper
of
the
orchestra
took
out
a
little
key
and
unlocked
a
door
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
lucien
following
his
friend
went
suddenly
out
of
the
lighted
corridor
into
the
black
darkness
of
the
passage
between
the
house
and
the
wings
a
short
flight
of
damp
steps
surmounted
one
of
the
strangest
of
all
spectacles
opened
out
before
the
provincial
eyes
the
height
of
the
roof
the
slenderness
of
the
props
the
ladders
hung
with
argand
lamps
the
atrocious
ugliness
of
scenery
beheld
at
close
quarters
the
thick
paint
on
the
actors
faces
and
their
outlandish
costumes
made
of
such
coarse
materials
the
stage
carpenters
in
greasy
jackets
the
firemen
the
stage
manager
strutting
about
with
his
hat
on
his
head
the
supernumeraries
sitting
among
the
hanging
the
ropes
and
pulleys
the
heterogeneous
collection
of
absurdities
shabby
dirty
hideous
and
gaudy
was
something
so
altogether
different
from
the
stage
seen
over
the
footlights
that
lucien
astonishment
knew
no
bounds
the
curtain
was
just
about
to
fall
on
a
good
melodrama
entitled
a
play
adapted
from
a
tragedy
by
maturin
which
charles
nodier
together
with
byron
and
sir
walter
scott
held
in
the
highest
esteem
though
the
play
was
a
failure
on
the
stage
in
paris
keep
a
tight
hold
of
my
arm
unless
you
have
a
mind
to
fall
through
a
or
bring
down
a
forest
on
your
head
you
will
pull
down
a
palace
or
carry
off
a
cottage
if
you
are
not
careful
said
etienne
is
florine
in
her
my
pet
he
added
addressing
an
actress
who
stood
waiting
for
her
cue
yes
love
thank
you
for
the
things
you
said
about
me
you
are
so
much
nicer
since
florine
has
come
here
come
do
spoil
your
entry
little
one
quick
with
you
look
sharp
and
say
wretched
man
nicely
for
there
are
two
thousand
francs
of
takings
lucien
was
struck
with
amazement
when
the
girl
whole
face
suddenly
changed
and
she
shrieked
stop
wretched
man
a
cry
that
froze
the
blood
in
your
veins
she
was
no
longer
the
same
creature
so
this
is
the
stage
he
said
to
lousteau
it
is
like
the
bookseller
shop
in
the
wooden
galleries
or
a
literary
paper
said
etienne
lousteau
it
is
a
kitchen
neither
more
nor
less
nathan
appeared
at
this
moment
what
brings
you
here
inquired
lousteau
why
i
am
doing
the
minor
theatres
for
the
until
something
better
turns
up
oh
come
to
supper
with
us
this
evening

well
of
florine
and
i
will
do
as
much
for
you

much

your
service
returned
nathan
you
know
she
is
living
in
the
rue
du
bondy
now
lousteau
dear
boy
who
is
the
handsome
young
man
that
you
have
brought
with
you
asked
the
actress
now
returned
to
the
wings
a
great
poet
dear
that
will
have
a
famous
name
one
of
these
days
nathan
i
must
introduce
lucien
de
rubempre
to
you
as
you
are
to
meet
again
at
supper

have
a
good
name
monsieur
said
nathan
lucien
raoul
nathan
continued
etienne
i
read
your
book
two
days
ago
and
upon
my
word
i
can
not
understand
how
you
who
have
written
such
a
book
and
such
poetry
can
be
so
humble
to
a
journalist
wait
till
your
first
book
comes
out
said
nathan
and
a
shrewd
smile
flitted
over
his
face
i
say
i
say
here
are
ultras
and
liberals
actually
shaking
hands
cried
vernou
spying
the
trio
in
the
morning
i
hold
the
views
of
my
paper
said
nathan
in
the
evening
i
think
as
i
please
all
journalists
see
double
at
night
felicien
vernou
turned
to
lousteau
finot
is
looking
for
you
etienne
he
came
with
me
and
here
he
is
ah
by
the
by
there
is
not
a
place
in
the
house
is
there
asked
finot
you
will
always
find
a
place
in
our
hearts
said
the
actress
with
the
sweetest
smile
imaginable
i
say
my
little
florville
are
you
cured
already
of
your
fancy
they
told
me
that
a
russian
prince
had
carried
you
off
who
carries
off
women
in
these
days
said
florville
she
who
had
cried
stop
wretched
man
we
stayed
at
for
ten
days
and
my
prince
got
off
with
paying
the
forfeit
money
to
the
management
the
manager
will
go
down
on
his
knees
to
pray
for
some
more
russian
princes
florville
continued
laughing
the
forfeit
money
was
so
much
clear
gain
and
as
for
you
child
said
finot
turning
to
a
pretty
girl
in
a
peasant
costume
where
did
you
steal
these
diamond
have
you
hooked
an
indian
prince
no
a
blacking
manufacturer
an
englishman
who
has
gone
off
already
it
is
not
everybody
who
can
find
millionaire
shopkeepers
tired
of
domestic
life
whenever
they
like
as
florine
does
and
coralie
they
just
lucky
florville
you
will
make
a
bad
entry
said
lousteau
the
blacking
has
gone
to
your
head
if
you
want
a
success
said
nathan
instead
of
screaming
is
saved
like
a
fury
walk
on
quite
quietly
go
to
the
staircase
and
say
is
saved
in
a
chest
voice
like
pasta
in
there
go
along
and
he
pushed
her
towards
the
stage
it
is
too
late
said
vernou
the
effect
has
hung
fire
what
did
she
do
the
house
is
applauding
like
mad
asked
lousteau
went
down
on
her
knees
and
showed
her
bosom
that
is
her
great
resource
said
the
widow
the
manager
is
giving
up
the
stage
box
to
us
you
will
find
me
there
when
you
come
said
finot
as
lousteau
walked
off
with
lucien
at
the
back
of
the
stage
through
a
labyrinth
of
scenery
and
corridors
the
pair
climbed
several
flights
of
stairs
and
reached
a
little
room
on
a
third
floor
nathan
and
felicien
vernou
following
them
or
gentlemen
said
florine
then
turning
to
a
short
stout
man
standing
in
a
corner
these
gentlemen
are
the
rulers
of
my
destiny
she
said
my
future
is
in
their
hands
but
they
will
be
under
our
table
morning
i
hope
if
lousteau
has
forgotten
nothing
forgotten
you
are
going
to
have
blondet
of
the
said
etienne
the
genuine
blondet
the
very
blondet
blondet
himself
in
short
oh
lousteau
you
dear
boy
stop
i
must
give
you
a
kiss
and
she
flung
her
arms
about
the
journalist
neck
matifat
the
stout
person
in
the
corner
looked
serious
at
this
florine
was
thin
her
beauty
like
a
bud
gave
promise
of
the
flower
to
come
the
girl
of
sixteen
could
only
delight
the
eyes
of
artists
who
prefer
the
sketch
to
the
picture
all
the
quick
subtlety
of
her
character
was
visible
in
the
features
of
the
charming
actress
who
at
that
time
might
have
sat
for
goethe
mignon
matifat
a
wealthy
druggist
of
the
rue
des
lombards
had
imagined
that
a
little
boulevard
actress
would
have
no
very
expensive
tastes
but
in
eleven
months
florine
had
cost
him
sixty
thousand
francs
nothing
seemed
more
extraordinary
to
lucien
than
the
sight
of
an
honest
and
worthy
merchant
standing
like
a
statue
of
the
god
terminus
in
the
narrow
a
tiny
place
some
ten
feet
square
hung
with
a
pretty
and
adorned
with
a
mirror
a
sofa
and
two
chairs
there
was
a
fireplace
in
the
a
carpet
on
the
floor
and
cupboards
all
round
the
room
a
dresser
was
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
a
spanish
costume
for
florine
was
to
take
the
part
of
a
countess
in
an
imbroglio
that
girl
will
be
the
handsomest
actress
in
paris
in
five
time
said
nathan
turning
to
felicien
vernou
by
the
by
darlings
you
will
take
care
of
me
wo
you
said
florine
turning
to
the
three
journalists
i
have
engaged
cabs
for
for
i
am
going
to
send
you
home
as
tipsy
as
shrove
tuesday
matifat
has
sent
in
wines
oh
wines
worthy
of
louis
and
engaged
the
prussian
ambassador
cook
we
expect
something
enormous
from
the
look
of
the
gentleman
remarked
nathan
and
he
is
quite
aware
that
he
is
treating
the
most
dangerous
men
in
paris
added
florine
matifat
was
looking
uneasily
at
lucien
he
felt
jealous
of
the
young
man
good
looks
but
here
is
some
one
that
i
do
not
know
florine
continued
confronting
lucien
which
of
you
has
imported
the
apollo
belvedere
from
florence
he
is
as
charming
as
one
of
girodet
figures
he
is
a
poet
mademoiselle
from
the
provinces
i
forgot
to
present
him
to
you
you
are
so
beautiful
that
you
put
the
guide
to
out
of
a
man
head
is
he
so
rich
that
he
can
afford
to
write
poetry
asked
florine
poor
as
job
said
lucien
it
is
a
great
temptation
for
some
of
us
said
the
actress
just
then
the
author
of
the
play
suddenly
entered
and
lucien
beheld
du
bruel
a
short
attenuated
young
man
in
an
overcoat
a
composite
human
blend
of
the
the
owner
of
and
the
stockbroker
florine
child
said
this
personage
are
you
sure
of
your
part
eh
no
slips
of
memory
you
know
and
mind
that
scene
in
the
second
act
make
the
irony
tell
bring
out
that
subtle
touch
say
do
not
love
you
just
as
we
agreed
why
do
you
take
parts
in
which
you
have
to
say
such
things
asked
matifat
the
druggist
remark
was
received
with
a
general
shout
of
laughter
what
does
it
matter
to
you
said
florine
so
long
as
i
do
say
such
things
to
you
great
stupid
oh
his
stupidity
is
the
pleasure
of
my
life
she
continued
glancing
at
the
journalist
upon
my
word
i
would
pay
him
so
much
for
every
blunder
if
it
would
not
be
the
ruin
of
me
yes
but
you
will
look
at
me
when
you
say
it
as
you
do
when
you
are
rehearsing
and
it
gives
me
a
turn
remonstrated
the
druggist
very
well
then
i
will
look
at
my
friend
lousteau
here
a
bell
rang
outside
in
the
passage
go
out
all
of
you
cried
florine
let
me
read
my
part
over
again
and
try
to
understand
it
lucien
and
lousteau
were
the
last
to
go
lousteau
set
a
kiss
on
florine
shoulder
and
lucien
heard
her
say
not
impossible
that
stupid
old
animal
told
his
wife
that
he
was
going
out
into
the
country
is
she
charming
said
etienne
as
they
came
away
but
but
that
matifat
my
dear
fellow
oh
you
know
nothing
of
parisian
life
my
boy
some
things
can
not
be
helped
suppose
that
you
fell
in
love
with
a
married
woman
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
it
all
depends
on
the
way
that
you
look
at
it
etienne
and
lucien
entered
the
and
found
the
manager
there
with
finot
matifat
was
in
the
box
exactly
opposite
with
a
friend
of
his
a
named
camusot
coralie
protector
and
a
worthy
little
old
soul
his
all
three
of
these
city
men
were
polishing
their
and
anxiously
scanning
the
house
certain
symptoms
in
the
pit
appeared
to
disturb
them
the
usual
heterogeneous
elements
filled
the
boxes
journalists
and
their
mistresses
and
their
lovers
a
sprinkling
of
the
determined
playgoers
who
never
miss
a
first
night
if
they
can
help
it
and
a
very
few
people
of
fashion
who
care
for
this
sort
of
sensation
the
first
box
was
occupied
by
the
head
of
a
department
to
whom
du
bruel
maker
of
vaudevilles
owed
a
snug
little
sinecure
in
the
treasury
lucien
had
gone
from
surprise
to
surprise
since
the
dinner
at
flicoteaux
for
two
months
literature
had
meant
a
life
of
poverty
and
want
in
lousteau
room
he
had
seen
it
at
its
cynical
worst
in
the
wooden
galleries
he
had
met
literature
abject
and
literature
insolent
the
sharp
contrasts
of
heights
and
depths
of
compromise
with
conscience
of
supreme
power
and
want
of
principle
of
treachery
and
pleasure
of
mental
elevation
and
bondage
all
this
made
his
head
swim
he
seemed
to
be
watching
some
strange
drama
finot
was
talking
with
the
manager
do
you
think
du
bruel
piece
will
pay
he
asked
du
bruel
has
tried
to
do
something
in
beaumarchais
style
boulevard
audiences
do
care
for
that
kind
of
thing
they
like
harrowing
sensations
wit
is
not
much
appreciated
here
everything
depends
on
florine
and
coralie
they
are
bewitchingly
pretty
and
graceful
wear
very
short
skirts
and
dance
a
spanish
dance
and
possibly
they
may
carry
off
the
piece
with
the
public
the
whole
affair
is
a
gambling
speculation
a
few
clever
notices
in
the
papers
and
i
may
make
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
if
the
play
takes
oh
come
it
will
only
be
a
moderate
success
i
can
see
said
finot
three
of
the
theatres
have
got
up
a
plot
continued
the
manager
they
will
even
hiss
the
piece
but
i
have
made
arrangements
to
defeat
their
kind
intentions
i
have
squared
the
men
in
their
pay
they
will
make
a
muddle
of
it
a
couple
of
city
men
yonder
have
taken
a
hundred
tickets
apiece
to
secure
a
triumph
for
florine
and
coralie
and
given
them
to
acquaintances
able
and
ready
to
act
as
chuckers
out
the
fellows
having
been
paid
twice
will
go
quietly
and
a
scene
of
that
sort
always
makes
a
good
impression
on
the
house
two
hundred
tickets
what
invaluable
men
exclaimed
finot
yes
with
two
more
actresses
as
handsomely
kept
as
florine
and
coralie
i
should
make
something
out
of
the
business
for
the
past
two
hours
the
word
money
had
been
sounding
in
ears
as
the
solution
of
every
difficulty
in
the
theatre
as
in
the
publishing
trade
and
in
the
publishing
trade
as
in
the
it
was
everywhere
the
same
there
was
not
a
word
of
art
or
of
glory
the
steady
beat
of
the
great
pendulum
money
seemed
to
fall
like
on
his
heart
and
brain
and
yet
while
the
orchestra
played
the
overture
while
the
pit
was
full
of
noisy
tumult
of
applause
and
hisses
unconsciously
he
drew
a
comparison
between
this
scene
and
others
that
came
up
in
his
mind
visions
arose
before
him
of
david
and
the
of
the
poetry
that
he
came
to
know
in
that
atmosphere
of
pure
peace
when
together
they
beheld
the
wonders
of
art
the
high
successes
of
genius
and
visions
of
glory
borne
on
stainless
wings
he
thought
of
the
evenings
spent
with
and
his
friends
and
tears
glittered
in
his
eyes
what
is
the
matter
with
you
asked
etienne
lousteau
i
see
poetry
fallen
into
the
mire
ah
you
have
still
some
illusions
left
my
dear
fellow
is
there
nothing
for
it
but
to
cringe
and
submit
to
thickheads
like
matifat
and
camusot
as
actresses
bow
down
to
journalists
and
we
ourselves
to
the
booksellers
my
boy
do
you
see
that
fellow
said
etienne
lowering
his
voice
and
glancing
at
finot
he
has
neither
genius
nor
cleverness
but
he
is
covetous
he
means
to
make
a
fortune
at
all
costs
and
he
is
a
keen
man
of
business
did
you
see
how
he
made
forty
per
cent
out
of
me
at
dauriat
and
talked
as
if
he
were
doing
me
a
favor
well
he
gets
letters
from
not
a
few
unknown
men
of
genius
who
go
down
on
their
knees
to
him
for
a
hundred
francs
the
words
recalled
the
sketch
that
lay
on
the
table
in
the
editor
office
and
the
words
finot
my
hundred
francs
inmost
soul
shrank
from
the
man
in
disgust
i
would
sooner
die
he
said
sooner
live
retorted
etienne
the
curtain
rose
and
the
went
off
to
the
wings
to
give
orders
finot
turned
to
etienne
my
dear
fellow
dauriat
has
passed
his
word
i
am
proprietor
of
of
his
weekly
paper
i
have
agreed
to
give
thirty
thousand
francs
in
cash
on
condition
that
i
am
to
be
editor
and
director
is
a
splendid
thing
blondet
told
me
that
the
government
intends
to
take
restrictive
measures
against
the
press
there
will
be
no
new
papers
allowed
in
six
months
time
it
will
cost
a
million
francs
to
start
a
new
journal
so
i
struck
a
bargain
though
i
have
only
ten
thousand
francs
in
hand
listen
to
me
if
you
can
sell
of
my
share
that
is
of
the
paper
to
matifat
for
thirty
thousand
francs
you
shall
be
editor
of
my
little
paper
with
a
salary
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs
per
month
i
want
in
any
case
to
have
the
control
of
my
old
paper
and
to
keep
my
hold
upon
it
but
nobody
need
know
that
and
your
name
will
appear
as
editor
you
will
be
paid
at
the
rate
of
five
francs
per
column
you
need
not
pay
contributors
more
than
three
francs
and
you
keep
the
difference
that
means
another
four
hundred
and
fifty
francs
per
month
but
at
the
same
time
i
reserve
the
right
to
use
the
paper
to
attack
or
defend
men
or
causes
as
i
please
and
you
may
indulge
your
own
likes
and
dislikes
so
long
as
you
do
not
interfere
with
my
schemes
perhaps
i
may
be
a
ministerialist
perhaps
ultra
i
do
not
know
yet
but
i
mean
to
keep
up
my
connections
with
the
liberal
party
below
the
surface
i
can
speak
out
with
you
you
are
a
good
fellow
i
might
perhaps
give
you
the
chambers
to
do
for
another
paper
on
which
i
work
i
am
afraid
i
can
scarcely
keep
on
with
it
now
so
let
florine
do
this
bit
of
jockeying
tell
her
to
put
the
screw
on
her
druggist
if
i
ca
find
the
money
within
hours
i
must
cry
off
my
bargain
dauriat
sold
another
third
to
his
printer
and
for
thirty
thousand
francs
so
he
has
his
own
third
and
ten
thousand
francs
to
the
good
for
he
only
gave
fifty
thousand
for
the
whole
affair
and
in
another
year
time
the
magazine
will
be
worth
two
hundred
thousand
francs
if
the
court
buys
it
up
if
the
court
has
the
good
sense
to
suppress
newspapers
as
they
say
you
are
lucky
said
lousteau
if
you
had
gone
through
all
that
i
have
endured
you
would
not
say
that
of
me
i
had
my
fill
of
misery
in
those
days
you
see
and
there
was
no
help
for
it
my
father
is
a
hatter
he
still
keeps
a
shop
in
the
rue
du
coq
nothing
but
millions
of
money
or
a
social
cataclysm
can
open
out
the
way
to
my
goal
and
of
the
two
alternatives
i
know
now
that
the
revolution
is
not
the
easier
if
i
bore
your
friend
name
i
should
have
a
chance
to
get
on
hush
here
comes
the
manager
and
finot
rose
to
his
feet
i
am
going
to
the
opera
i
shall
very
likely
have
a
duel
on
my
hands
for
i
have
put
my
initials
to
a
terrific
attack
on
a
couple
of
dancers
under
the
protection
of
two
generals
i
am
giving
it
them
hot
and
strong
at
the
opera
aha
said
the
manager
yes
they
are
stingy
with
me
returned
finot
now
cutting
off
a
box
and
now
declining
to
take
fifty
subscriptions
i
have
sent
in
my
i
mean
to
have
a
hundred
subscriptions
out
of
them
and
a
box
four
times
a
month
if
they
take
my
terms
i
shall
have
eight
hundred
readers
and
a
thousand
paying
subscribers
so
we
shall
have
twelve
hundred
with
the
new
year
you
will
end
by
ruining
us
said
the
manager
are
not
much
hurt
with
your
ten
subscriptions
i
had
two
good
notices
put
into
the
oh
i
am
not
complaining
of
you
cried
the
manager
till
evening
lousteau
said
finot
you
can
give
me
your
answer
at
the
francais
there
is
a
new
piece
on
there
and
as
i
shall
not
be
able
to
write
the
notice
you
can
take
my
box
i
will
give
you
preference
you
have
worked
yourself
to
death
for
me
and
i
am
grateful
felicien
vernou
offered
twenty
thousand
francs
for
a
third
share
of
my
little
paper
and
to
work
without
a
salary
for
a
twelvemonth
but
i
want
to
be
absolute
master
he
is
not
named
finot
slyboots
for
nothing
said
lucien
he
is
a
that
will
get
on
in
the
world
said
etienne
careless
whether
the
wily
schemer
overheard
the
remark
or
not
as
he
shut
the
door
of
the
box
said
the
manager
he
will
be
a
millionaire
he
will
enjoy
the
respect
of
all
who
know
him
he
may
perhaps
have
friends
some
day
good
heavens
what
a
den
said
lucien
and
are
you
going
to
drag
that
excellent
creature
into
such
a
business
he
continued
looking
at
florine
who
gave
them
side
glances
from
the
stage
she
will
carry
it
through
too
you
do
not
know
the
devotion
and
the
wiles
of
these
beloved
beings
said
lousteau
they
redeem
their
failings
and
expiate
all
their
sins
by
boundless
love
when
they
love
said
the
manager
a
great
love
is
all
the
grander
in
an
actress
by
reason
of
its
violent
contrast
with
her
surroundings
and
he
who
finds
it
finds
a
diamond
worthy
of
the
proudest
crown
lying
in
the
mud
returned
lousteau
but
coralie
is
not
attending
to
her
part
remarked
the
manager
coralie
is
smitten
with
our
friend
here
all
unsuspicious
of
his
conquest
and
coralie
will
make
a
fiasco
she
is
missing
her
cues
this
is
the
second
time
she
had
not
heard
the
prompter
pray
go
into
the
corner
monsieur
he
continued
if
coralie
is
smitten
with
you
i
will
go
and
tell
her
that
you
have
left
the
house
no
no
cried
lousteau
tell
coralie
that
this
gentleman
is
coming
to
supper
and
that
she
can
do
as
she
likes
with
him
and
she
will
play
like
mlle
mars
the
manager
went
and
lucien
turned
to
etienne
what
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
will
ask
that
druggist
through
mlle
florine
to
pay
thirty
thousand
francs
for
a
share
when
finot
gave
no
more
for
the
whole
of
it
and
ask
without
the
slightest
scruple
lousteau
interrupted
lucien
before
he
had
time
to
finish
his
expostulation
my
dear
boy
what
country
can
you
come
from
the
druggist
is
not
a
man
he
is
a
strong
box
delivered
into
our
hands
by
his
fancy
for
an
actress
how
about
your
conscience
conscience
my
dear
fellow
is
a
stick
which
every
one
takes
up
to
beat
his
neighbor
and
not
for
application
to
his
own
back
come
now
who
the
devil
are
you
angry
with
in
one
day
chance
has
worked
a
miracle
for
you
a
miracle
for
which
i
have
been
waiting
these
two
years
and
you
must
needs
amuse
yourself
by
finding
fault
with
the
means
what
you
appear
to
me
to
possess
intelligence
you
seem
to
be
in
a
fair
way
to
reach
that
freedom
from
prejudice
which
is
a
first
necessity
to
intellectual
adventurers
in
the
world
we
live
in
and
are
you
wallowing
in
scruples
worthy
of
a
nun
who
accuses
herself
of
eating
an
egg
with
concupiscence
if
florine
succeeds
i
shall
be
editor
of
a
newspaper
with
a
fixed
salary
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs
per
month
i
shall
take
the
important
plays
and
leave
the
vaudevilles
to
vernou
and
you
can
take
my
place
and
do
the
boulevard
theatres
and
so
get
a
foot
in
the
stirrup
you
will
make
three
francs
per
column
and
write
a
column
a
day
thirty
columns
a
month
means
ninety
francs
you
will
have
some
sixty
francs
worth
of
books
to
sell
to
barbet
and
lastly
you
can
demand
ten
tickets
a
month
of
each
of
your
theatres
that
is
forty
tickets
in
all
and
sell
them
for
forty
francs
to
a
barbet
who
deals
in
them
i
will
introduce
you
to
the
man
so
you
will
have
two
hundred
francs
coming
in
every
month
then
if
you
make
yourself
useful
to
finot
you
might
get
a
hundred
francs
for
an
article
in
this
new
weekly
review
of
his
in
which
case
you
would
show
uncommon
talent
for
all
the
articles
are
signed
and
you
can
not
put
in
work
as
you
can
on
a
small
paper
in
that
case
you
would
be
making
a
hundred
crowns
a
month
now
my
dear
boy
there
are
men
of
ability
like
that
poor
who
dines
at
every
day
who
may
wait
for
ten
years
before
they
will
make
a
hundred
crowns
and
you
will
be
making
four
thousand
francs
a
year
by
your
pen
to
say
nothing
of
the
books
you
will
write
for
the
trade
if
you
do
work
of
that
kind
now
a
salary
only
amounts
to
a
thousand
crowns
and
there
he
stops
in
his
arrondissement
wearing
away
time
like
the
rung
of
a
chair
i
say
nothing
of
the
pleasure
of
going
to
the
theatre
without
paying
for
your
seat
for
that
is
a
delight
which
quickly
palls
but
you
can
go
behind
the
scenes
in
four
theatres
be
hard
and
sarcastic
for
a
month
or
two
and
you
will
be
simply
overwhelmed
with
invitations
from
actresses
and
their
adorers
will
pay
court
to
you
you
will
only
dine
at
flicoteaux
when
you
happen
to
have
less
than
thirty
sous
in
your
pocket
and
no
dinner
engagement
at
the
luxembourg
at
five
you
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
now
you
are
on
the
eve
of
entering
a
privileged
class
you
will
be
one
of
the
hundred
persons
who
tell
france
what
to
think
in
three
time
if
all
goes
well
you
can
if
you
choose
make
a
man
life
a
curse
to
him
by
putting
thirty
jokes
at
his
expense
in
print
at
the
rate
of
three
a
day
you
can
if
you
choose
draw
a
revenue
of
pleasure
from
the
actresses
at
your
theatres
you
can
wreck
a
good
play
and
send
all
paris
running
after
a
bad
one
if
dauriat
declines
to
pay
you
for
your
you
can
make
him
come
to
you
and
meekly
and
humbly
implore
you
to
take
two
thousand
francs
for
them
if
you
have
the
ability
and
knock
off
two
or
three
articles
that
threaten
to
spoil
some
of
dauriat
speculations
or
to
ruin
a
book
on
which
he
counts
you
will
see
him
come
climbing
up
your
stairs
like
a
clematis
and
always
at
the
door
of
your
dwelling
as
for
your
novel
the
booksellers
who
would
show
you
more
or
less
politely
to
the
door
at
this
moment
will
be
standing
outside
your
attic
in
a
string
and
the
value
of
the
manuscript
which
old
doguereau
valued
at
four
hundred
francs
will
rise
to
four
thousand
these
are
the
advantages
of
the
journalist
profession
so
let
us
do
our
best
to
keep
all
newcomers
out
of
it
it
needs
an
immense
amount
of
brains
to
make
your
way
and
a
still
greater
amount
of
luck
and
here
are
you
quibbling
over
your
good
fortune
if
we
had
not
met
you
see
at
flicoteaux
you
might
have
danced
attendance
on
the
booksellers
for
another
three
years
or
starved
like
in
a
garret
by
the
time
that
is
as
learned
as
bayle
and
as
great
a
writer
of
prose
as
rousseau
we
shall
have
made
our
fortunes
you
and
i
and
we
shall
hold
his
in
our
hands
wealth
and
fame
to
give
or
to
hold
finot
will
be
a
deputy
and
proprietor
of
a
great
newspaper
and
we
shall
be
whatever
we
meant
to
be
peers
of
france
or
prisoner
for
debt
in
so
finot
will
sell
his
paper
to
the
highest
bidder
among
the
ministers
just
as
he
sells
favorable
notices
to
mme
bastienne
and
runs
down
mlle
virginie
saying
that
mme
bastienne
bonnets
are
superior
to
the
millinery
which
they
praised
at
first
said
lucien
recollecting
that
scene
in
the
office
my
dear
fellow
you
are
a
simpleton
lousteau
remarked
drily
three
years
ago
finot
was
walking
on
the
uppers
of
his
boots
dining
for
eighteen
sous
at
tabar
and
knocking
off
a
tradesman
prospectus
when
he
could
get
it
for
ten
francs
his
clothes
hung
together
by
some
miracle
as
mysterious
as
the
immaculate
conception
finot
has
a
paper
of
his
own
worth
about
a
hundred
thousand
francs
what
with
subscribers
who
pay
and
take
no
copies
genuine
subscriptions
and
indirect
taxes
levied
by
his
uncle
he
is
making
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
he
dines
most
sumptuously
every
day
he
has
set
up
a
cabriolet
within
the
last
month
and
now
at
last
behold
him
the
editor
of
a
weekly
review
with
a
sixth
share
for
which
he
will
not
pay
a
penny
a
salary
of
five
hundred
francs
per
month
and
another
thousand
francs
for
supplying
matter
which
costs
him
nothing
and
for
which
the
firm
pays
you
yourself
to
begin
with
if
finot
consents
to
pay
you
fifty
francs
per
sheet
will
be
only
too
glad
to
let
him
have
two
or
three
articles
for
nothing
when
you
are
in
his
position
you
can
judge
finot
a
man
can
only
be
tried
by
his
peers
and
for
you
is
there
not
an
immense
future
opening
out
before
you
if
you
will
blindly
minister
to
his
enmity
attack
at
finot
bidding
and
praise
when
he
gives
the
word
suppose
that
you
yourself
wish
to
be
revenged
upon
somebody
you
can
break
a
foe
or
friend
on
the
wheel
you
have
only
to
say
to
me
let
us
put
an
end
to
and
we
will
kill
him
by
a
phrase
put
in
the
paper
morning
by
morning
and
afterwards
you
can
slay
the
slain
with
a
solemn
article
in
weekly
indeed
if
it
is
a
matter
of
capital
importance
to
you
finot
would
allow
you
to
bludgeon
your
man
in
a
big
paper
with
ten
or
twelve
thousand
subscribers
you
make
yourself
indispensable
to
finot
then
are
you
sure
that
florine
can
bring
her
druggist
to
make
the
bargain
asked
lucien
dazzled
by
these
prospects
quite
sure
now
comes
the
interval
i
will
go
and
tell
her
everything
at
once
in
a
word
or
two
it
will
be
settled
if
florine
once
has
her
lesson
by
heart
she
will
have
all
my
wit
and
her
own
besides
and
there
sits
that
honest
tradesman
gaping
with
admiration
at
florine
little
suspecting
that
you
are
about
to
get
thirty
thousand
francs
out
of
him
more
twaddle
anybody
might
think
that
the
man
was
going
to
be
robbed
cried
lousteau
why
my
dear
boy
if
the
minister
buys
the
newspaper
the
druggist
may
make
twenty
thousand
francs
in
six
months
on
an
investment
of
thirty
thousand
matifat
is
not
looking
at
the
newspaper
but
at
florine
prospects
as
soon
as
it
is
known
that
matifat
and
camusot
for
they
will
go
shares
that
matifat
and
camusot
are
proprietors
of
a
review
the
newspapers
will
be
full
of
friendly
notices
of
florine
and
coralie
florine
name
will
be
made
she
will
perhaps
obtain
an
engagement
in
another
theatre
with
a
salary
of
twelve
thousand
francs
in
fact
matifat
will
save
a
thousand
francs
every
month
in
dinners
and
presents
to
journalists
you
know
nothing
of
men
nor
of
the
way
things
are
managed
poor
man
said
lucien
he
is
looking
forward
to
an
pleasure
and
he
will
be
sawn
in
two
with
arguments
until
florine
sees
receipt
for
a
sixth
share
of
the
paper
and
i
shall
be
editor
of
finot
paper
and
making
a
thousand
francs
a
month
the
end
of
my
troubles
is
in
sight
cried
florine
lover
lousteau
went
out
and
lucien
sat
like
one
bewildered
lost
in
the
infinite
of
thought
soaring
above
this
everyday
world
in
the
wooden
galleries
he
had
seen
the
wires
by
which
the
trade
in
books
is
moved
he
has
seen
something
of
the
kitchen
where
great
reputations
are
made
he
had
been
behind
the
scenes
he
had
seen
the
seamy
side
of
life
the
consciences
of
men
involved
in
the
machinery
of
paris
the
mechanism
of
it
all
as
he
watched
florine
on
the
stage
he
almost
envied
lousteau
his
good
fortune
already
for
a
few
moments
he
had
forgotten
matifat
in
the
background
he
was
not
left
alone
for
long
perhaps
for
not
more
than
five
minutes
but
those
minutes
seemed
an
eternity
thoughts
rose
within
him
that
set
his
soul
on
fire
as
the
spectacle
on
the
stage
had
heated
his
senses
he
looked
at
the
women
with
their
wanton
eyes
all
the
brighter
for
the
red
paint
on
their
cheeks
at
the
gleaming
bare
necks
the
luxuriant
forms
outlined
by
the
lascivious
folds
of
the
basquina
the
very
short
skirts
that
displayed
as
much
as
possible
of
limbs
encased
in
scarlet
stockings
with
green
clocks
to
them
a
disquieting
vision
for
the
pit
a
double
process
of
corruption
was
working
within
him
in
parallel
lines
like
two
channels
that
will
spread
sooner
or
later
in
flood
time
and
make
one
that
corruption
was
eating
into
lucien
soul
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
corner
staring
vacantly
at
the
curtain
one
arm
resting
on
the
crimson
velvet
cushion
and
his
hand
drooping
over
the
edge
he
felt
the
fascination
of
the
life
that
was
offered
to
him
of
the
gleams
of
light
among
its
clouds
and
this
so
much
the
more
keenly
because
it
shone
out
like
a
blaze
of
fireworks
against
the
blank
darkness
of
his
own
obscure
monotonous
days
of
toil
suddenly
his
listless
eyes
became
aware
of
a
burning
glance
that
reached
him
through
a
rent
in
the
curtain
and
roused
him
from
his
lethargy
those
were
coralie
eyes
that
glowed
upon
him
he
lowered
his
head
and
looked
across
at
camusot
who
just
then
entered
the
opposite
box
that
amateur
was
a
worthy
of
the
rue
des
bourdonnais
stout
and
substantial
a
judge
in
the
commercial
court
a
father
of
four
children
and
the
husband
of
a
second
wife
at
the
age
of
with
a
cap
of
gray
hair
on
his
head
he
had
the
smug
appearance
of
a
man
who
has
his
eighty
thousand
francs
of
income
and
having
been
forced
to
put
up
with
a
good
deal
that
he
did
not
like
in
the
way
of
business
has
fully
made
up
his
mind
to
enjoy
the
rest
of
his
life
and
not
to
quit
this
earth
until
he
has
had
his
share
of
cakes
and
ale
a
brow
the
color
of
fresh
butter
and
florid
cheeks
like
a
monk
jowl
seemed
scarcely
big
enough
to
contain
his
exuberant
jubilation
camusot
had
left
his
wife
at
home
and
they
were
applauding
coralie
to
the
skies
all
the
rich
man
citizen
vanity
was
summed
up
and
gratified
in
coralie
in
coralie
lodging
he
gave
himself
the
airs
of
a
great
lord
of
a
bygone
day
now
at
this
moment
he
felt
that
half
of
her
success
was
his
the
knowledge
that
he
had
paid
for
it
confirmed
him
in
this
idea
camusot
conduct
was
sanctioned
by
the
presence
of
his
a
little
old
fogy
with
powdered
hair
and
leering
eyes
highly
respected
nevertheless
again
lucien
felt
disgust
rising
within
him
he
thought
of
the
year
when
he
loved
mme
de
bargeton
with
an
exalted
and
disinterested
love
and
at
that
thought
love
as
a
poet
understands
it
spread
its
white
wings
about
him
countless
memories
drew
a
circle
of
distant
blue
horizon
about
the
great
man
of
angouleme
and
again
he
fell
to
dreaming
up
went
the
curtain
and
there
stood
coralie
and
florine
upon
the
stage
he
is
thinking
about
as
much
of
you
as
of
the
grand
turk
my
dear
girl
florine
said
in
an
aside
while
coralie
was
finishing
her
speech
lucien
could
not
help
laughing
he
looked
at
coralie
she
was
one
of
the
most
charming
and
captivating
actresses
in
paris
rivaling
mme
perrin
and
mlle
fleuriet
and
destined
likewise
to
share
their
fate
coralie
was
a
woman
of
a
type
that
exerts
at
will
a
power
of
fascination
over
men
with
an
oval
face
of
deep
ivory
tint
a
mouth
red
as
a
pomegranate
and
a
chin
subtly
delicate
in
its
contour
as
the
edge
of
a
porcelain
cup
coralie
was
a
jewess
of
the
sublime
type
the
jet
black
eyes
behind
their
curving
lashes
seemed
to
scorch
her
eyelids
you
could
guess
how
soft
they
might
grow
or
how
sparks
of
the
heat
of
the
desert
might
flash
from
them
in
response
to
a
summons
from
within
the
circles
of
olive
shadow
about
them
were
bounded
by
thick
arching
lines
of
eyebrow
magnificent
mental
power
amounting
to
genius
seemed
to
dwell
in
the
swarthy
forehead
beneath
the
double
curve
of
ebony
hair
that
lay
upon
it
like
a
crown
and
gleamed
in
the
light
like
a
varnished
surface
but
like
many
another
actress
coralie
had
little
wit
in
spite
of
her
aptness
at
greenroom
repartee
and
scarcely
any
education
in
spite
of
her
boudoir
experience
her
brain
was
prompted
by
her
senses
her
kindness
was
the
impulsive
of
girls
of
her
class
but
who
could
trouble
over
coralie
psychology
when
his
eyes
were
dazzled
by
those
smooth
round
arms
of
hers
the
fingers
the
fair
white
shoulders
and
breast
celebrated
in
the
song
of
songs
the
flexible
curving
lines
of
throat
the
graciously
moulded
outlines
beneath
the
scarlet
silk
stockings
and
this
beauty
worthy
of
an
eastern
poet
was
brought
into
relief
by
the
conventional
spanish
costume
of
the
stage
coralie
was
the
delight
of
the
pit
all
eyes
dwelt
on
the
outlines
moulded
by
the
clinging
folds
of
her
bodice
and
lingered
over
the
andalusian
contour
of
the
hips
from
which
her
skirt
hung
fluttering
wantonly
with
every
movement
to
lucien
watching
this
creature
who
played
for
him
alone
caring
no
more
for
camusot
than
a
in
the
gallery
cares
for
an
there
came
a
moment
when
he
set
desire
above
love
and
enjoyment
above
desire
and
the
demon
of
lust
stirred
strange
thoughts
in
him
i
know
nothing
of
the
love
that
wallows
in
luxury
and
wine
and
sensual
pleasure
he
said
within
himself
i
have
lived
more
with
ideas
than
with
realities
you
must
pass
through
all
experience
if
you
mean
to
render
all
experience
this
will
be
my
first
great
supper
my
first
orgy
in
a
new
and
strange
world
why
should
i
not
know
for
once
the
delights
which
the
great
lords
of
the
eighteenth
century
sought
so
eagerly
of
wantons
of
the
opera
must
one
not
first
learn
of
courtesans
and
actresses
the
delights
the
perfections
the
transports
the
resources
the
subtleties
of
love
if
only
to
translate
them
afterwards
into
the
regions
of
a
higher
love
than
this
and
what
is
all
this
after
all
but
the
poetry
of
the
senses
two
months
ago
these
women
seemed
to
me
to
be
goddesses
guarded
by
dragons
that
no
one
dared
approach
i
was
envying
lousteau
just
now
but
here
is
another
handsomer
than
florine
why
should
i
not
profit
by
her
fancy
when
the
greatest
nobles
buy
a
night
with
such
women
with
their
richest
treasures
when
ambassadors
set
foot
in
these
depths
they
fling
aside
all
thought
of
yesterday
or
i
should
be
a
fool
to
be
more
squeamish
than
princes
especially
as
i
love
no
one
as
yet
lucien
had
quite
forgotten
camusot
to
lousteau
he
had
expressed
the
utmost
disgust
for
this
most
hateful
of
all
partitions
and
now
he
himself
had
sunk
to
the
same
level
and
carried
away
by
the
casuistry
of
his
vehement
desire
had
given
the
reins
to
his
fancy
coralie
is
raving
about
you
said
lousteau
as
he
came
in
your
countenance
worthy
of
the
greatest
greek
sculptors
has
worked
unutterable
havoc
behind
the
scenes
you
are
in
luck
my
dear
boy
coralie
is
eighteen
years
old
and
in
a
few
days
time
she
may
be
making
sixty
thousand
francs
a
year
by
her
beauty
she
is
an
honest
girl
still
since
her
mother
sold
her
three
years
ago
for
sixty
thousand
francs
she
has
tried
to
find
happiness
and
found
nothing
but
annoyance
she
took
to
the
stage
in
a
desperate
mood
she
has
a
horror
of
her
first
purchaser
de
marsay
and
when
she
came
out
of
the
galleys
for
the
king
of
dandies
soon
dropped
her
she
picked
up
old
camusot
she
does
not
care
much
about
him
but
he
is
like
a
father
to
her
and
she
endures
him
and
his
love
several
times
already
she
has
refused
the
handsomest
proposals
she
is
faithful
to
camusot
who
lets
her
live
in
peace
so
you
are
her
first
love
the
first
sight
of
you
went
to
her
heart
like
a
florine
has
gone
to
her
to
bring
the
girl
to
reason
she
is
crying
over
your
cruelty
she
has
forgotten
her
part
the
play
will
go
to
pieces
and
to
the
engagement
at
the
gymnase
which
camusot
had
planned
for
her
pooh
poor
thing
said
lucien
every
instinct
of
vanity
was
tickled
by
the
words
he
felt
his
heart
swell
high
with
more
adventures
have
befallen
me
in
this
one
evening
my
dear
fellow
than
in
all
the
first
eighteen
years
of
my
life
and
lucien
related
the
history
of
his
love
affairs
with
mme
de
bargeton
and
of
the
cordial
hatred
he
bore
the
baron
du
chatelet
stay
though
the
newspaper
wants
a
we
will
take
him
up
the
baron
is
a
buck
of
the
empire
and
a
ministerialist
he
is
the
man
for
us
i
have
seen
him
many
a
time
at
the
opera
i
can
see
your
great
lady
as
i
sit
here
she
is
often
in
the
marquise
box
the
baron
is
paying
court
to
your
lady
love
a
cuttlefish
bone
that
she
is
wait
finot
has
just
sent
a
special
messenger
round
to
say
that
they
are
short
of
copy
at
the
office
young
hector
merlin
has
left
them
in
the
lurch
because
they
did
not
pay
for
white
lines
finot
in
despair
is
knocking
off
an
article
against
the
opera
well
now
my
dear
fellow
you
can
do
this
play
listen
to
it
and
think
it
over
and
i
will
go
to
the
manager
office
and
think
out
three
columns
about
your
man
and
your
disdainful
fair
one
they
will
be
in
no
pleasant
predicament
so
this
is
how
a
newspaper
is
written
said
lucien
it
is
always
like
this
answered
lousteau
these
ten
months
that
i
have
been
a
journalist
they
have
always
run
short
of
copy
at
eight
in
the
evening
manuscript
sent
to
the
printer
is
spoken
of
as
copy
doubtless
because
the
writers
are
supposed
to
send
in
a
fair
copy
of
their
work
or
possibly
the
word
is
ironically
derived
from
the
latin
word
for
copy
is
invariably
scarce
we
always
mean
to
have
a
few
numbers
ready
in
advance
a
grand
idea
that
will
never
be
realized
continued
lousteau
it
is
ten
you
see
and
not
a
line
has
been
written
i
shall
ask
vernou
and
nathan
for
a
score
of
epigrams
on
deputies
or
on
cruzoe
or
on
the
ministry
or
on
friends
of
ours
if
it
needs
must
be
a
man
in
this
pass
would
slaughter
his
parent
just
as
a
privateer
will
load
his
guns
with
silver
pieces
taken
out
of
the
booty
sooner
than
perish
write
a
brilliant
article
and
you
will
make
brilliant
progress
in
finot
estimation
for
finot
has
a
lively
sense
of
benefits
to
come
and
that
sort
of
gratitude
is
better
than
any
kind
of
pledge
pawntickets
always
excepted
for
they
invariably
represent
something
solid
what
kind
of
men
can
journalists
be
are
you
to
sit
down
at
a
table
and
be
witty
to
order
just
exactly
as
a
lamp
begins
to
burn
when
you
apply
a
match
so
long
as
there
is
any
oil
in
it
lousteau
hand
was
on
the
lock
when
du
bruel
came
in
with
the
manager
permit
me
monsieur
to
take
a
message
to
coralie
allow
me
to
tell
her
that
you
will
go
home
with
her
after
supper
or
my
play
will
be
ruined
the
wretched
girl
does
not
know
what
she
is
doing
or
saying
she
will
cry
when
she
ought
to
laugh
and
laugh
when
she
ought
to
cry
she
has
been
hissed
once
already
you
can
still
save
the
piece
and
after
all
pleasure
is
not
a
misfortune
i
am
not
accustomed
to
rivals
sir
lucien
answered
pray
do
tell
her
that
cried
the
manager
coralie
is
just
the
girl
to
fling
camusot
overboard
and
ruin
herself
in
good
earnest
the
proprietor
of
the
worthy
man
allows
her
two
thousand
francs
a
month
and
pays
for
all
her
dresses
and
as
your
promise
pledges
me
to
nothing
save
your
play
said
lucien
with
a
sultan
airs
but
do
look
as
if
you
meant
to
snub
that
charming
creature
pleaded
du
bruel
dear
me
am
i
to
write
the
notice
of
your
play
and
smile
on
your
heroine
as
well
exclaimed
the
poet
the
author
vanished
with
a
signal
to
coralie
who
began
to
act
forthwith
in
a
marvelous
way
vignol
who
played
the
part
of
the
alcalde
and
revealed
for
the
first
time
his
genius
as
an
actor
of
old
men
came
forward
amid
a
storm
of
applause
to
make
an
announcement
to
the
house
the
piece
which
we
have
the
honor
of
playing
for
you
this
evening
gentlemen
is
the
work
of
mm
raoul
and
de
cursy
why
nathan
is
partly
responsible
said
lousteau
i
do
wonder
that
he
looked
in
shouted
the
enraptured
house
florine
too
roared
a
voice
of
thunder
from
the
opposite
box
and
other
voices
took
up
the
cry
florine
and
coralie
the
curtain
rose
vignol
reappeared
between
the
two
actresses
matifat
and
camusot
flung
wreaths
on
the
stage
and
coralie
stooped
for
her
flowers
and
held
them
out
to
lucien
for
him
those
two
hours
spent
in
the
theatre
seemed
to
be
a
dream
the
spell
that
held
him
had
begun
to
work
when
he
went
behind
the
scenes
and
in
spite
of
its
horrors
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
its
sensuality
and
dissolute
morals
had
affected
the
poet
still
untainted
nature
a
sort
of
malaria
that
infects
the
soul
seems
to
lurk
among
those
dark
filthy
passages
filled
with
machinery
and
lit
with
smoky
greasy
lamps
the
solemnity
and
reality
of
life
disappear
the
most
sacred
things
are
matter
for
a
jest
the
most
impossible
things
seem
to
be
true
lucien
felt
as
if
he
had
taken
some
narcotic
and
coralie
had
completed
the
work
he
plunged
into
this
joyous
intoxication
the
lights
in
the
great
chandelier
were
extinguished
there
was
no
one
left
in
the
house
except
the
boxkeepers
busy
taking
away
footstools
and
shutting
doors
the
noises
echoing
strangely
through
the
empty
theatre
the
footlights
blown
out
as
one
candle
sent
up
a
fetid
reek
of
smoke
the
curtain
rose
again
a
lantern
was
lowered
from
the
ceiling
and
firemen
and
stage
carpenters
departed
on
their
rounds
the
fairy
scenes
of
the
stage
the
rows
of
fair
faces
in
the
boxes
the
dazzling
lights
the
magical
illusion
of
new
scenery
and
costume
had
all
disappeared
and
dismal
darkness
emptiness
and
cold
reigned
in
their
stead
it
was
hideous
lucien
sat
on
in
bewilderment
well
are
you
coming
my
boy
lousteau
voice
called
from
the
stage
jump
down
lucien
sprang
over
he
scarcely
recognized
florine
and
coralie
in
their
ordinary
quilted
paletots
and
cloaks
with
their
faces
hidden
by
hats
and
thick
black
veils
two
butterflies
returned
to
the
chrysalis
stage
could
not
be
more
completely
transformed
will
you
honor
me
by
giving
me
your
arm
coralie
asked
tremulously
with
pleasure
said
lucien
he
could
feel
the
beating
of
her
heart
throbbing
against
his
like
some
snared
bird
as
she
nestled
closely
to
his
side
with
something
of
the
delight
of
a
cat
that
rubs
herself
against
her
master
with
eager
silken
caresses
so
we
are
supping
together
she
said
the
party
of
four
found
two
cabs
waiting
for
them
at
the
door
in
the
rue
des
coralie
drew
lucien
to
one
of
the
two
in
which
camusot
and
his
old
cardot
were
seated
already
she
offered
du
bruel
a
fifth
place
and
the
manager
drove
off
with
florine
matifat
and
lousteau
these
hackney
cabs
are
abominable
things
said
coralie
why
do
you
have
a
carriage
returned
du
bruel
she
asked
pettishly
i
do
not
like
to
tell
you
before
cardot
face
for
he
trained
his
no
doubt
would
you
believe
it
little
and
old
as
he
is
cardot
only
gives
florine
five
hundred
francs
a
month
just
about
enough
to
pay
for
her
rent
and
her
grub
and
her
clothes
the
old
marquis
de
rochegude
offered
me
a
brougham
two
months
ago
and
he
has
six
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
but
i
am
an
artist
and
not
a
common
hussy
you
shall
have
a
carriage
the
day
after
miss
said
camusot
benignly
you
never
asked
me
for
one
as
if
one
for
such
a
thing
as
that
what
you
love
a
woman
and
let
her
paddle
about
in
the
mud
at
the
risk
of
breaking
her
legs
nobody
but
a
knight
of
the
yardstick
likes
to
see
a
draggled
skirt
hem
as
she
uttered
the
sharp
words
that
cut
camusot
to
the
quick
she
groped
for
lucien
knee
and
pressed
it
against
her
own
and
clasped
her
fingers
upon
his
hand
she
was
silent
all
her
power
to
feel
seemed
to
be
concentrated
upon
the
ineffable
joy
of
a
moment
which
brings
compensation
for
the
whole
wretched
past
of
a
life
such
as
these
poor
creatures
lead
and
develops
within
their
souls
a
poetry
of
which
other
women
happily
ignorant
of
these
violent
revulsions
know
nothing
you
played
like
mlle
mars
herself
towards
the
end
said
du
bruel
yes
said
camusot
something
put
her
out
at
the
beginning
but
from
the
middle
of
the
second
act
to
the
very
end
she
was
enough
to
drive
you
wild
with
admiration
half
of
the
success
of
your
play
was
due
to
her
and
half
of
her
success
is
due
to
me
said
du
bruel
this
is
all
much
ado
about
nothing
said
coralie
in
an
unfamiliar
voice
and
seizing
an
opportunity
in
the
darkness
she
carried
lucien
hand
to
her
lips
and
kissed
it
and
drenched
it
with
tears
lucien
felt
thrilled
through
and
through
by
that
touch
for
in
the
humility
of
the
courtesan
love
there
is
a
magnificence
which
might
set
an
example
to
angels
are
you
writing
the
dramatic
criticism
monsieur
said
du
bruel
addressing
lucien
you
can
write
a
charming
paragraph
about
our
dear
coralie
oh
do
us
that
little
service
pleaded
camusot
down
on
his
knees
metaphorically
speaking
before
the
critic
you
will
always
find
me
ready
to
do
you
a
good
turn
at
any
time
do
leave
him
his
independence
coralie
exclaimed
angrily
he
will
write
what
he
pleases
papa
camusot
buy
carriages
for
me
instead
of
praises
you
shall
have
them
on
very
easy
terms
lucien
answered
politely
i
have
never
written
for
newspapers
before
so
i
am
not
accustomed
to
their
ways
my
maiden
pen
is
at
your
disposal
that
is
funny
said
du
bruel
here
we
are
in
the
rue
de
bondy
said
cardot
coralie
sally
had
quite
crushed
the
little
old
man
if
you
are
giving
me
the
first
fruits
of
your
pen
the
first
love
that
has
sprung
up
in
my
heart
shall
be
yours
whispered
coralie
in
the
brief
instant
that
they
remained
alone
together
in
the
cab
then
she
went
up
to
florine
bedroom
to
change
her
dress
for
a
toilette
previously
sent
lucien
had
no
idea
how
lavishly
a
prosperous
merchant
will
spend
money
upon
an
actress
or
a
mistress
when
he
means
to
enjoy
a
life
of
pleasure
matifat
was
not
nearly
so
rich
a
man
as
his
friend
camusot
and
he
had
done
his
part
rather
shabbily
yet
the
sight
of
the
took
lucien
by
surprise
the
walls
were
hung
with
green
cloth
with
a
border
of
gilded
nails
the
whole
room
was
artistically
decorated
lighted
by
handsome
lamps
stands
full
of
flowers
stood
in
every
direction
the
was
resplendent
with
the
furniture
in
fashion
in
those
days
a
thomire
chandelier
a
carpet
of
eastern
design
and
yellow
silken
hangings
relieved
by
a
brown
border
the
candlesticks
and
clock
were
all
in
good
taste
for
matifat
had
left
everything
to
grindot
a
rising
architect
who
was
building
a
house
for
him
and
the
young
man
had
taken
great
pains
with
the
rooms
when
he
knew
that
florine
was
to
occupy
them
matifat
a
tradesman
to
the
backbone
went
about
carefully
afraid
to
touch
the
new
furniture
he
seemed
to
have
the
totals
of
the
bills
always
before
his
eyes
and
to
look
upon
the
splendors
about
him
as
so
much
jewelry
imprudently
withdrawn
from
the
case
and
i
shall
be
obliged
to
do
as
much
for
florentine
old
eyes
seemed
to
say
lucien
at
once
began
to
understand
lousteau
indifference
to
the
state
of
his
garret
etienne
was
the
real
king
of
these
festivals
etienne
enjoyed
the
use
of
all
these
fine
things
he
was
standing
just
now
on
the
hearthrug
with
his
back
to
the
fire
as
if
he
were
the
master
of
the
house
chatting
with
the
manager
who
was
congratulating
du
bruel
copy
copy
called
finot
coming
into
the
room
there
is
nothing
in
the
box
the

are
setting
up
my
article
and
they
will
soon
have
finished
we
will
manage
said
etienne
there
is
a
fire
burning
in
boudoir
there
is
a
table
there
and
if
matifat

find
us
paper
and
ink
we
will
knock
off
the
newspaper
while
florine
and
coralie
are
dressing
cardot
camusot
and
matifat
disappeared
in
search
of
quills
penknives
and
everything
necessary
suddenly
the
door
was
flung
open
and
tullia
one
of
the
prettiest
of
the
day
dashed
into
the
room
they
agree
to
take
the
hundred
copies
dear
boy
she
cried
addressing
finot
they
wo
cost
the
management
anything
for
the
chorus
and
the
orchestra
and
the
de
are
to
take
them
whether
they
like
it
or
not
but
your
paper
is
so
clever
that
nobody
will
grumble
and
you
are
going
to
have
your
boxes
here
is
the
subscription
for
the
first
quarter
she
continued
holding
out
a
couple
of
banknotes
so
do
cut
me
up
it
is
all
over
with
me
groaned
finot
i
must
suppress
my
abominable
diatribe
and
i
have
another
notion
in
my
head
what
a
happy
inspiration
divine
lais
exclaimed
blondet
who
had
followed
the
lady
upstairs
and
brought
nathan
vernou
and
claude
vignon
with
him

to
supper
there
is
a
dear
or
i
will
crush
thee
butterfly
as
thou
art
there
will
be
no
professional
jealousies
as
you
are
a
dancer
and
as
to
beauty
you
have
all
of
you
too
much
sense
to
show
jealousy
in
public
oh

cried
finot
nathan
blondet
du

said
lucien
i
have
enough
for
one
added
lousteau
very
well
nathan
vernou
and
du
bruel
will
make
the
jokes
at
the
end
and
blondet
good
fellow
surely
will
vouchsafe
a
couple
of
short
columns
for
the
first
sheet
i
will
run
round
to
the
printer
it
is
lucky
that
you
brought
your
carriage
tullia
yes
but
the
duke
is
waiting
below
in
it
and
he
has
a
german

with
him
ask
the

to
come
up
said
nathan
a
german
they
are

and
they
listen
too
he
shall
hear
some
astonishing
things
to
send
home
to
his
government
cried
blondet
is
there
any
sufficiently
serious
personage
to
go
down
to
speak
to
him
asked
finot
here
du

you

exclaimed
matifat
paling
visibly
no
fourteen
said
a
voice
in
the
doorway
and
florentine
appeared
i
have
come
to
look
after
cardot
she
added
speaking
with
a
burlesque
english
accent
and
besides
said
lousteau
claude
vignon
came
with
blondet
i
brought
him
here
to
drink
returned
blondet
taking
up
an
inkstand
look
here
all
of
you
you
must
use
all
your
wit
before
those
bottles
of
wine
drive
it
out
and
of
all
things
stir
up
du
bruel
he
is
a
vaudevillist
he
is
capable
of
making
bad
jokes
if
you
get
him
to
concert
pitch
and
lucien
wrote
his
first
newspaper
article
at
the
round
table
in
florine
boudoir
by
the
light
of
the
pink
candles
lighted
by
matifat
before
such
a
remarkable
audience
he
was
eager
to
show
what
he
could
do
the
first
performance
of
the
in
a
an
imbroglio
in
three
first
appearance
of
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
vignol
people
are
coming
and
going
walking
and
talking
everybody
is
looking
for
something
nobody
finds
anything
general
hubbub
the
alcalde
has
lost
his
daughter
and
found
his
cap
but
the
cap
does
not
fit
it
must
belong
to
some
thief
where
is
the
thief
people
walk
and
talk
and
come
and
go
more
than
ever
finally
the
alcalde
finds
a
man
without
his
daughter
and
his
daughter
without
the
man
which
is
satisfactory
for
the
magistrate
but
not
for
the
audience
quiet
being
resorted
the
alcalde
tries
to
examine
the
man
behold
a
venerable
alcalde
sitting
in
an
alcalde
great
armchair
arranging
the
sleeves
of
his
alcalde
gown
only
in
spain
do
alcaldes
cling
to
their
enormous
sleeves
and
wear
plaited
lawn
ruffles
about
the
magisterial
throat
a
good
half
of
an
alcalde
business
on
the
stage
in
paris
this
particular
alcalde
wheezing
and
waddling
about
like
an
asthmatic
old
man
is
vignol
on
whom
potier
mantle
has
fallen
a
young
actor
who
personates
old
age
so
admirably
that
the
oldest
men
in
the
audience
can
not
help
laughing
with
that
quavering
voice
of
his
that
bald
forehead
and
those
spindle
shanks
trembling
under
the
weight
of
a
senile
frame
he
may
look
forward
to
a
long
career
of
decrepitude
there
is
something
alarming
about
the
young
actor
old
age
he
is
so
very
old
you
feel
nervous
lest
senility
should
be
infectious
and
what
an
admirable
alcalde
he
makes
what
a
delightful
uneasy
smile
what
pompous
stupidity
what
wooden
dignity
what
judicial
hesitation
how
well
the
man
knows
that
black
may
be
white
or
white
black
how
eminently
well
he
is
fitted
to
be
minister
to
a
constitutional
monarch
the
stranger
answers
every
one
of
his
inquiries
by
a
question
vignol
retorts
in
such
a
fashion
that
the
person
under
examination
elicits
all
the
truth
from
the
alcalde
this
piece
of
pure
comedy
with
a
breath
of
moliere
throughout
puts
the
house
in
good
humor
the
people
on
the
stage
all
seemed
to
understand
what
they
were
about
but
i
am
quite
unable
to
clear
up
the
mystery
or
to
say
wherein
it
lay
for
the
alcalde
daughter
was
there
personified
by
a
living
breathing
andalusian
a
spaniard
with
a
spaniard
eyes
a
complexion
a
spaniard
gait
and
figure
a
spaniard
from
top
to
toe
with
her
poniard
in
her
garter
love
in
her
heart
and
a
cross
on
the
ribbon
about
her
neck
when
the
act
was
over
and
somebody
asked
me
how
the
piece
was
going
i
answered
she
wears
scarlet
stockings
with
green
clocks
to
them
she
has
a
little
foot
no
larger
than
in
her
patent
leather
shoes
and
the
prettiest
pair
of
ankles
in
andalusia
oh
that
daughter
brings
your
heart
into
your
mouth
she
tantalizes
you
so
horribly
that
you
long
to
spring
upon
the
stage
and
offer
her
your
thatched
hovel
and
your
heart
or
thirty
thousand
livres
per
annum
and
your
pen
the
andalusian
is
the
loveliest
actress
in
paris
coralie
for
she
must
be
called
by
her
real
name
can
be
a
countess
or
a
and
in
which
part
she
would
be
more
charming
one
can
not
tell
she
can
be
anything
that
she
chooses
she
is
born
to
achieve
all
possibilities
can
more
be
said
of
a
boulevard
actress
with
the
second
act
a
parisian
spaniard
appeared
upon
the
scene
with
her
features
cut
like
a
cameo
and
her
dangerous
eyes
where
does
she
come
from
i
asked
in
my
turn
and
was
told
that
she
came
from
the
greenroom
and
that
she
was
mademoiselle
florine
but
upon
my
word
i
could
not
believe
a
syllable
of
it
such
spirit
was
there
in
her
gestures
such
frenzy
in
her
love
she
is
the
rival
of
the
alcalde
daughter
and
married
to
a
grandee
cut
out
to
wear
an
almaviva
cloak
with
stuff
sufficient
in
it
for
a
hundred
boulevard
noblemen
mlle
florine
wore
neither
scarlet
stockings
with
green
clocks
nor
patent
leather
shoes
but
she
appeared
in
a
mantilla
a
veil
which
she
put
to
admirable
uses
like
the
great
lady
that
she
is
she
showed
to
admiration
that
the
tigress
can
be
a
cat
i
began
to
understand
from
the
sparkling
talk
between
the
two
that
some
drama
of
jealousy
was
going
on
and
just
as
everything
was
put
right
the
alcalde
stupidity
embroiled
everybody
again
torchbearers
rich
men
footmen
figaros
grandees
alcaldes
dames
and
damsels
the
whole
company
on
the
stage
began
to
eddy
about
and
come
and
go
and
look
for
one
another
the
plot
thickened
again
i
left
it
to
thicken
for
florine
the
jealous
and
the
happy
coralie
had
entangled
me
once
more
in
the
folds
of
mantilla
and
basquina
and
their
little
feet
were
twinkling
in
my
eyes
i
managed
however
to
reach
the
third
act
without
any
mishap
the
commissary
of
police
was
not
compelled
to
interfere
and
i
did
nothing
to
scandalize
the
house
wherefore
i
begin
to
believe
in
the
influence
of
that
public
and
religious
morality
about
which
the
chamber
of
deputies
is
so
anxious
that
any
one
might
think
there
was
no
morality
left
in
france
i
even
contrived
to
gather
that
a
man
was
in
love
with
two
women
who
failed
to
return
his
affection
or
else
that
two
women
were
in
love
with
a
man
who
loved
neither
of
them
the
man
did
not
love
the
alcalde
or
the
alcalde
had
no
love
for
the
man
who
was
nevertheless
a
gallant
gentleman
and
in
love
with
somebody
with
himself
perhaps
or
with
heaven
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
for
he
becomes
a
monk
and
if
you
want
to
know
any
more
you
can
go
to
the
you
are
hereby
given
fair
warning
you
must
go
once
to
accustom
yourself
to
those
irresistible
scarlet
stockings
with
the
green
clocks
to
little
feet
full
of
promises
to
eyes
with
a
ray
of
sunlight
shining
through
them
to
the
subtle
charm
of
a
parisienne
disguised
as
an
andalusian
girl
and
of
an
andalusian
masquerading
as
a
parisienne
you
must
go
a
second
time
to
enjoy
the
play
to
shed
tears
over
the
grandee
and
die
of
laughing
at
the
old
alcalde
the
play
is
twice
a
success
the
author
who
writes
it
it
is
said
in
collaboration
with
one
of
the
great
poets
of
the
day
was
called
before
the
curtain
and
appeared
with
a
damsel
on
each
arm
and
fairly
brought
down
the
excited
house
the
two
dancers
seemed
to
have
more
wit
in
their
legs
than
the
author
himself
but
when
once
the
fair
rivals
left
the
stage
the
dialogue
seemed
witty
at
once
a
triumphant
proof
of
the
excellence
of
the
piece
the
applause
and
calls
for
the
author
caused
the
architect
some
anxiety
but
de
cursy
the
author
being
accustomed
to
volcanic
eruptions
of
the
reeling
vesuvius
beneath
the
chandelier
felt
no
tremor
as
for
the
actresses
they
danced
the
famous
bolero
of
seville
which
once
found
favor
in
the
sight
of
a
council
of
reverend
fathers
and
escaped
ecclesiastical
censure
in
spite
of
its
wanton
dangerous
grace
the
bolero
in
itself
would
be
enough
to
attract
old
age
while
there
is
any
lingering
heat
of
youth
in
the
veins
and
out
of
charity
i
warn
these
persons
to
keep
the
lenses
of
their
well
polished
while
lucien
was
writing
a
column
which
was
to
set
a
new
fashion
in
journalism
and
reveal
a
fresh
and
original
gift
lousteau
indited
an
article
of
the
kind
described
as
a
sketch
of
contemporary
manners
entitled
elderly
the
buck
of
the
empire
he
wrote
is
invariably
long
slender
and
well
preserved
he
wears
a
corset
and
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
his
name
was
originally
potelet
or
something
very
like
it
but
to
stand
well
with
the
court
he
conferred
a
upon
himself
and
potelet
he
is
until
another
revolution
a
baron
of
the
empire
a
man
of
two
ends
as
his
name
a
post
implies
he
is
paying
his
court
to
the
faubourg
after
a
youth
gloriously
and
usefully
spent
as
the
agreeable
trainbearer
of
a
sister
of
the
man
whom
decency
forbids
me
to
mention
by
name
du
potelet
has
forgotten
that
he
was
once
in
waiting
upon
her
imperial
highness
but
he
still
sings
the
songs
composed
for
the
benefactress
who
took
such
a
tender
interest
in
his
career
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
it
was
a
tissue
of
personalities
silly
enough
for
the
most
part
such
as
they
used
to
write
in
those
days
other
papers
and
notably
the
have
brought
the
art
to
a
curious
perfection
since
lousteau
compared
the
baron
to
a
heron
and
introduced
mme
de
bargeton
to
whom
he
was
paying
his
court
as
a
cuttlefish
bone
a
burlesque
absurdity
which
amused
readers
who
knew
neither
of
the
personages
a
tale
of
the
loves
of
the

tried
in
vain
to
swallow
the
cuttlefish
bone
which
broke
into
three
pieces
when
he
dropped
it
was
irresistibly
ludicrous
everybody
remembers
the
sensation
which
the
pleasantry
made
in
the
faubourg
it
was
the
first
of
a
series
of
similar
articles
and
was
one
of
the
thousand
and
one
causes
which
provoked
the
rigorous
press
legislation
of
charles
x
an
hour
later
blondet
lousteau
and
lucien
came
back
to
the
where
the
other
guests
were
chatting
the
duke
was
there
and
the
minister
the
four
women
the
three
merchants
the
manager
and
finot
a
printer
devil
with
a
paper
cap
on
his

was
waiting
even
then
for

the

just
going
off
if
i
have
nothing
to

he
said
stay
a

here
are
ten

and
tell
them
to
wait
said
finot
if
i
give
them
the
money
sir
they
would
take
to
tippleography
and
to
the
newspaper
that
boy
is
appalling
to
me
remarked
finot
and
the
minister
was
in
the
middle
of
a
prediction
of
a
brilliant
future
for
the
urchin
when
the
three
came
in
blondet
read
aloud
an
extremely
clever
article
against
the
romantics
lousteau
paragraph
drew
laughter
and
by
the
duc
de
rhetore
advice
an
indirect
eulogium
of
mme
was
slipped
in
lest
the
whole
faubourg
should
take
offence
what
have
written
asked
finot
turning
to
lucien
and
lucien
read
quaking
for
fear
but
the
room
rang
with
applause
when
he
finished
the
actresses
embraced
the
neophyte
and
the
two
merchants
following
suit
half
choked
the
breath
out
of
him
there
were
tears
in
du
bruel
eyes
as
he
grasped
his
critic
hand
and
the
manager
invited
him
to
dinner
there
are
no
children
nowadays
said
blondet
since
de
chateaubriand
called
victor
hugo
a
child
i
can
only
tell
you
quite
simply
that
you
have
spirit
and
taste
and
write
like
a
gentleman
he
is
on
the
newspaper
said
finot
as
he
thanked
etienne
and
gave
him
a
shrewd
glance
what
jokes
have
you
made
inquired
lousteau
turning
to
blondet
and

here

nathan
now
that
le

perhaps
let
alone
le

demosthenes
was
heard
to
say
yesterday
an
ultra
condemning
pasquier
speech
said
his
programme
was
only
a
continuation
of
decaze
policy
yes
said
a
lady
but
he
stands
on
a
monarchical
basis
he
has
just
the
kind
of
leg
for
a
court
suit
with
such
a
beginning
i
do
ask
more
of
you
said
finot
it
will
be
all
run
round
with
this
he
added
turning
to
the
boy
the
paper
is
not
exactly
a
genuine
article
but
it
is
our
best
number
yet
and
he
turned
to
the
group
of
writers
already
colleagues
were
privately
taking
his
measure
that
fellow
has
brains
said
blondet
his

is

written

went
across
to

and
tullia
went
in
to
supper
between
emile
blondet
and
the
german
minister
i
can
not
understand
why
you
are
making
an
onslaught
on
mme
de

and
the
baron
du

they
say
that
he
is
of

and
will
be
master
of
requests
some
day
mme
de

showed
lucien
the
door
as
if
he
had
been
an
imposter
said
lousteau
such
a
fine
young
fellow
exclaimed
the
minister
supper
served
with
new
plate
sevres
porcelain
and
white
damask
was
redolent
of
opulence
the
dishes
were
from

the
wines
from
a
celebrated
merchant
on
the
quai
a
personal
friend
of
matifat
for
the
first
time
lucien
beheld
the
luxury
of
paris
displayed
he
went
from
surprise
to
surprise
but
he
kept
his
astonishment
to
himself
like
a
man
who
had
spirit
and
taste
and
wrote
like
a
gentleman
as
blondet
had
said
as
they
crossed
the
coralie
bent
to
florine
make
camusot
so
drunk
that
he
will
be
compelled
to
stop
here
all
night
she
whispered
so
you
have
hooked
your
journalist
have
you
returned
florine
using
the
idiom
of
women
of
her
class
no
dear
i
love
him
said
coralie
with
an
adorable
little
shrug
of
the
shoulders
those
words
rang
in
lucien
ears
borne
to
them
by
the
fifth
deadly
sin
coralie
was
perfectly
dressed
every
woman
possesses
some
personal
charm
in
perfection
and
coralie
toilette
brought
her
characteristic
beauty
into
prominence
her
dress
moreover
like
florine
was
of
some
exquisite
stuff
unknown
as
yet
to
the
public
a
de
with
which
camusot
had
been
supplied
a
few
days
before
the
rest
of
the
world
for
as
owner
of
the
he
was

kind
of
providence

the

silkweavers
love
and
toilet
are
like
color
and
perfume
for
a
woman
and
coralie
in
her
happiness
looked
lovelier
than
ever
a
delight
which
can
not
elude
the
grasp
possesses
an
immense
charm
for
youth
perhaps
in
their
eyes
the
secret
of
the
attraction
of
a
house
of
pleasure
lies
in
the
certainty
of
gratification
perhaps
many
a
long
fidelity
is
attributable
to
the
same
cause
love
for
love
sake
first
love
indeed
had
blent
with
one
of
the
strange
violent
fancies
which
sometimes
possess
these
poor
creatures
and
love
and
admiration
of
lucien
great
beauty
taught
coralie
to
express
the
thoughts
in
her
heart
i
should
love
you
if
you
were
ill
and
ugly
she
whispered
as
they
sat
down
what
a
saying
for
a
poet
camusot
utterly
vanished
lucien
had
forgotten
his
existence
he
saw
coralie
and
had
eyes
for
nothing
else
how
should
he
draw
back
this
creature
all
sensation
all
enjoyment
of
life
tired
of
the
monotony
of
existence
in
a
country
town
weary
of
poverty
harassed
by
enforced
continence
impatient
of
the
claustral
life
of
the
rue
de
cluny
of
toiling
without
reward
the
fascination
of
the
under
world
of
paris
was
upon
him
how
should
he
rise
and
leave
this
brilliant
gathering
lucien
stood
with
one
foot
in
coralie
chamber
and
the
other
in
the
quicksands
of
journalism
after
so
much
vain
search
and
climbing
of
so
many
stairs
after
standing
about
and
waiting
in
the
rue
de
sentier
he
had
found
journalism
a
jolly
boon
companion
joyous
over
the
wine
his
wrongs
had
just
been
avenged
there
were
two
for
whom
he
had
vainly
striven
to
fill
the
cup
of
humiliation
and
pain
which
he
had
been
made
to
drink
to
the
dregs
and
now
they
should
receive
a
stab
in
their
very
hearts
here
is
a
real
friend
he
thought
as
he
looked
at
lousteau
it
never
crossed
his
mind
that
lousteau
already
regarded
him
as
a
dangerous
rival
he
had
made
a
blunder
he
had
done
his
very
best
when
a
colorless
article
would
have
served
him
admirably
well
remark
to
finot
that
it
would
be
better
to
come
to
terms
with
a
man
of
that
calibre
had
counteracted
lousteau
gnawing
jealousy
he
reflected
that
it
would
be
prudent
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
lucien
and
at
the
same
time
to
arrange
with
finot
to
exploit
this
formidable
newcomer
he
must
be
kept
in
poverty
the
decision
was
made
in
a
moment
and
the
bargain
made
in
a
few
whispered
words
he
has
talent
he
will
want
the
more
ah
good
a
supper
among
french
journalists
always
fills
me
with
dread
said
the
german
diplomatist
with
serene
urbanity
he
looked
as
he
spoke
at
blondet
whom
he
had
met
at
the
comtesse
de
montcornet
it
is
laid
upon
you
gentlemen
to
fulfil
a
prophecy
of
blucher
what
prophecy
asked
nathan
when
blucher
and
sacken
arrived
on
the
heights
of
montmartre
in
pardon
me
gentlemen
for
recalling
a
day
unfortunate
for
france
sacken
a
rough
brute
remarked
we
will
set
paris
alight
very
good
care
that
you
do
said
blucher
will
die
of
nothing
else
can
kill
her
and
he
waved
his
hand
over
the
glowing
seething
city
that
lay
like
a
huge
canker
in
the
valley
of
the
there
are
no
journalists
in
our
country
thank
heaven
continued
the
minister
after
a
pause
i
have
not
yet
recovered
from
the
fright
that
the
little
fellow
gave
me
a
boy
of
ten
in
a
paper
cap
with
the
sense
of
an
old
diplomatist
and
i
feel
as
if
i
were
supping
with
lions
and
panthers
who
graciously
sheathe
their
claws
in
my
honor
it
is
clear
said
blondet
that
we
are
at
liberty
to
inform
europe
that
a
serpent
dropped
from
your
excellency
lips
this
evening
and
that
the
venomous
creature
failed
to
inoculate
mlle
tullia
the
prettiest
dancer
in
paris
and
to
follow
up
the
story
with
a
commentary
on
eve
and
the
scriptures
and
the
first
and
last
transgression
but
have
no
fear
you
are
our
guest
it
would
be
funny
said
finot
we
would
begin
with
a
scientific
treatise
on
all
the
serpents
found
in
the
human
heart
and
human
body
and
so
proceed
to
the
said
lousteau
and
we
could
exhibit
one
in
spirits
in
a
bottle
of
brandied
cherries
said
vernou
till
you
yourself
would
end
by
believing
in
the
story
added
vignon
looking
at
the
diplomatist
gentlemen
cried
the
duc
de
rhetore
let
sleeping
claws
lie
the
influence
and
power
of
the
press
is
only
dawning
said
finot
journalism
is
in
its
infancy
it
will
grow
in
ten
years
time
everything
will
be
brought
into
publicity
the
light
of
thought
will
be
turned
on
all
subjects
and
the
blight
of
thought
will
be
over
it
all
corrected
blondet
here
is
an
apothegm
cried
claude
vignon
thought
will
make
kings
said
lousteau
and
undo
monarchs
said
the
german
and
therefore
said
blondet
if
the
press
did
not
exist
it
would
be
necessary
to
invent
it
forthwith
but
here
we
have
it
and
live
by
it
you
will
die
of
it
returned
the
german
diplomatist
can
you
not
see
that
if
you
enlighten
the
masses
and
raise
them
in
the
political
scale
you
make
it
all
the
harder
for
the
individual
to
rise
above
their
level
can
you
not
see
that
if
you
sow
the
seeds
of
reasoning
among
the
you
will
reap
revolt
and
be
the
first
to
fall
victims
what
do
they
smash
in
paris
when
a
riot
begins
the
said
nathan
but
we
are
too
modest
to
fear
for
ourselves
we
only
run
the
risk
of
cracks
as
a
nation
you
have
too
much
mental
activity
to
allow
any
government
to
run
its
course
without
interference
but
for
that
you
would
make
the
conquest
of
europe
a
second
time
and
win
with
the
pen
all
that
you
failed
to
keep
with
the
sword
journalism
is
an
evil
said
claude
vignon
the
evil
may
have
its
uses
but
the
present
government
is
resolved
to
put
it
down
there
will
be
a
battle
over
it
who
will
give
way
that
is
the
question
the
government
will
give
way
said
blondet
i
keep
telling
people
that
with
all
my
might
intellectual
power
is
great
power
in
france
and
the
press
has
more
wit
than
all
men
of
intellect
put
together
and
the
hypocrisy
of
tartufe
besides
blondet
blondet
you
are
going
too
far

are
present
you
are
the
proprietor
of
one
of
those
poison
shops
you
have
reason
to
be
afraid
but
i
can
laugh
at
the
whole
business
even
if
i
live
by
it
blondet
is
right
said
claude
vignon
journalism
so
far
from
being
in
the
hands
of
a
priesthood
came
to
be
first
a
party
weapon
and
then
a
commercial
speculation
carried
on
without
conscience
or
scruple
like
other
commercial
speculations
every
newspaper
as
blondet
says
is
a
shop
to
which
people
come
for
opinions
of
the
right
shade
if
there
were
a
paper
for
hunchbacks
it
would
set
forth
plainly
morning
and
evening
in
its
columns
the
beauty
the
utility
and
necessity
of
deformity
a
newspaper
is
not
supposed
to
enlighten
its
readers
but
to
supply
them
with
congenial
opinions
give
any
newspaper
time
enough
and
it
will
be
base
hypocritical
shameless
and
treacherous
the
periodical
press
will
be
the
death
of
ideas
systems
and
individuals
nay
it
will
flourish
upon
their
decay
it
will
take
the
credit
of
all
creations
of
the
brain
the
harm
that
it
does
is
done
anonymously
we
for

whichever
you

invents
a
scandalous
libel

gets
off
with
an
apology
for
taking
so
great
a

complains
that
nobody

the
mistake
but
ask
for
redress
and
he
will
laugh
in
your
face
and
treat
his
offence
as
a
mere
trifle
the
paper
scoffs
if
the
victim
gains
the

if
heavy

awarded
the

is
held
up
as

unpatriotic
obscurantist

everything

the

unpatriotic

the

be
infallible
one
religion

be
played
off
against

already
indeed
but
in
ten
time
every
little
youngster
that
has
left
school
will
take
himself
for
a
great
man
slash
his
predecessors
from
the
lofty
height
of
a
newspaper
column
drag
them
down
by
the
feet
and
take
their
place
napoleon
did
wisely
when
he
muzzled
the
press
i
would
wager
that
the
opposition
papers
would
batter
down
a
government
of
their
own
setting
up
just
as
they
are
battering
the
present
government
if
any
demand
was
refused
the
more
they
have
the
more
they
will
want
in
the
way
of
concessions
the
journalist
will
be
succeeded
by
the
starveling
hack
there
is
no
salve
for
this
sore
it
is
a
kind
of
corruption
which
grows
more
and
more
obtrusive
and
malignant
the
wider
it
spreads
the
more
patiently
it
will
be
endured
until
the
day
comes
when
newspapers
shall
so
increase
and
multiply
in
the
earth
that
confusion
will
be
the
result
a
second
babel
we
all
of
us
such
as
we
are
have
reason
to
know
that
crowned
kings
are
less
ungrateful
than
kings
of
our
profession
that
the
most
sordid
man
of
business
is
not
so
mercenary
nor
so
keen
in
speculation
that
our
brains
are
consumed
to
furnish
their
daily
supply
of
poisonous
trash
and
yet
we
all
of
us
shall
continue
to
write
like
men
who
work
in
quicksilver
mines
knowing
that
they
are
doomed
to
die
of
their
trade
look
there
he
continued
at
that
young
man
sitting
beside
coralie
what
is
his
name
lucien
he
has
a
beautiful
face
he
is
a
poet
and
what
is
more
he
is
witty
so
much
the
better
for
him
well
he
will
cross
the
threshold
of
one
of
those
dens
where
a
man
intellect
is
prostituted
he
will
put
all
his
best
and
finest
thought
into
his
work
he
will
blunt
his
intellect
and
sully
his
soul
he
will
be
guilty
of
anonymous
meannesses
which
take
the
place
of
stratagem
pillage
and
ratting
to
the
enemy
in
the
warfare
of
and
when
like
hundreds
more
he
has
squandered
his
genius
in
the
service
of
others
who
find
the
capital
and
do
no
work
those
dealers
in
poisons
will
leave
him
to
starve
if
he
is
thirsty
and
to
die
of
thirst
if
he
is
starving
thanks
said
finot
but
dear
me
continued
claude
vignon
knew
all
this
yet
here
am
i
in
the
galleys
and
the
arrival
of
another
convict
gives
me
pleasure
we
are
cleverer
blondet
and
i
than
messieurs
this
and
that
who
speculate
in
our
abilities
yet
nevertheless
we
are
always
exploited
by
them
we
have
a
heart
somewhere
beneath
the
intellect
we
have
not
the
grim
qualities
of
the
man
who
makes
others
work
for
him
we
are
indolent
we
like
to
look
on
at
the
game
we
are
meditative
and
we
are
fastidious
they
will
sweat
our
brains
and
blame
us
for
improvidence
i
thought
you
would
be
more
amusing
than
this
said
florine
florine
is
right
said
blondet
let
us
leave
the
cure
of
public
evils
to
those
quacks
the
statesmen
as
charlet
says
with
my
own
bread
and
butter
do
you
know
what
vignon
puts
me
in
mind
of
said
lousteau
of
one
of
those
fat
women
in
the
rue
du
pelican
telling
a
schoolboy
boy
you
are
too
young
to
come
here
a
burst
of
laughter
followed
the
sally
but
it
pleased
coralie
the
merchants
meanwhile
ate
and
drank
and
listened
what
a
nation
this
is
you
see
so
much
good
in
it
and
so
much
evil
said
the
minister
addressing
the
duc
de
you
are
prodigals
who
can
not
ruin
yourselves
gentlemen
and
so
by
the
blessing
of
chance
lucien
standing
on
the
brink
of
the
precipice
over
which
he
was
destined
to
fall
heard
warnings
on
all
sides
had
set
him
on
the
right
road
had
shown
him
the
noble
method
of
work
and
aroused
in
him
the
spirit
before
which
all
obstacles
disappear
lousteau
himself
partly
from
selfish
motives
had
tried
to
warn
him
away
by
describing
journalism
and
literature
in
their
practical
aspects
lucien
had
refused
to
believe
that
there
could
be
so
much
hidden
corruption
but
now
he
had
heard
the
journalists
themselves
crying
woe
for
their
hurt
he
had
seen
them
at
their
work
had
watched
them
tearing
their
heart
to
read
auguries
of
the
future
that
evening
he
had
seen
things
as
they
are
he
beheld
the
very
heart
core
of
corruption
of
that
paris
which
blucher
so
aptly
described
and
so
far
from
shuddering
at
the
sight
he
was
intoxicated
with
enjoyment
of
the
intellectually
stimulating
society
in
which
he
found
himself
these
extraordinary
men
clad
in
armor
damascened
by
their
vices
these
intellects
environed
by
cold
and
brilliant
analysis
seemed
so
far
greater
in
his
eyes
than
the
grave
and
earnest
members
of
the
brotherhood
and
besides
all
this
he
was
reveling
in
his
first
taste
of
luxury
he
had
fallen
under
the
spell
his
capricious
instincts
awoke
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
drank
exquisite
wines
this
was
his
first
experience
of
cookery
carried
to
the
pitch
of
a
fine
art
a
minister
a
duke
and
an
had
joined
the
party
of
journalists
and
wondered
at
their
sinister
power
lucien
felt
a
horrible
craving
to
reign
over
these
kings
and
he
thought
that
he
had
power
to
win
his
kingdom
finally
there
was
this
coralie
made
happy
by
a
few
words
of
his
by
the
bright
light
of
the
through
the
steam
of
the
dishes
and
the
fumes
of
wine
she
looked
sublimely
beautiful
to
his
eyes
so
fair
had
she
grown
with
love
she
was
the
loveliest
the
most
beautiful
actress
in
paris
the
brotherhood
the
heaven
of
noble
thoughts
faded
away
before
a
temptation
that
appealed
to
every
fibre
of
his
nature
how
could
it
have
been
otherwise
lucien
author
vanity
had
just
been
gratified
by
the
praises
of
those
who
know
by
the
appreciation
of
his
future
rivals
the
success
of
his
articles
and
his
conquest
of
coralie
might
have
turned
an
older
head
than
his
during
the
discussion
moreover
every
one
at
table
had
made
a
remarkably
good
supper
and
such
wines
are
not
met
with
every
day
lousteau
sitting
beside
camusot
furtively
poured
several
times
into
his
neighbor
wineglass
and
challenged
him
to
drink
and
camusot
drank
all
unsuspicious
for
he
thought
himself
in
his
own
way
a
match
for
a
journalist
the
jokes
became
more
personal
when
dessert
appeared
and
the
wine
began
to
circulate
the
german
minister
a
man
of
the
world
made
a
sign
to
the
duke
and
tullia
and
the
three
disappeared
with
the
first
symptoms
of
vociferous
nonsense
which
precede
the
grotesque
scenes
of
an
orgy
in
its
final
stage
coralie
and
lucien
had
been
behaving
like
children
all
the
evening
as
soon
as
the
wine
was
uppermost
in
camusot
head
they
made
good
their
escape
down
the
staircase
and
sprang
into
a
cab
camusot
subsided
under
the
table
matifat
looking
round
for
him
thought
that
he
had
gone
home
with
coralie
left
his
guests
to
smoke
laugh
and
argue
and
followed
florine
to
her
room
daylight
surprised
the
party
or
more
accurately
the
first
dawn
of
light
discovered
one
man
still
able
to
speak
and
blondet
that
intrepid
champion
was
proposing
to
the
assembled
sleepers
a
health
to
aurora
the
lucien
was
unaccustomed
to
orgies
of
this
kind
his
head
was
very
tolerably
clear
as
he
came
down
the
staircase
but
the
fresh
air
was
too
much
for
him
he
was
horribly
drunk
when
they
reached
the
handsome
house
in
the
rue
de
vendome
where
the
actress
lived
coralie
and
her
were
obliged
to
assist
the
poet
to
climb
to
the
first
floor
lucien
was
ignominiously
sick
and
very
nearly
fainted
on
the
staircase
quick
berenice
some
tea
make
some
tea
cried
coralie
it
is
nothing
it
is
the
air
lucien
got
out
and
i
have
never
taken
so
much
before
in
my
life
poor
boy
he
is
as
innocent
as
a
lamb
said
berenice
a
stalwart
norman
peasant
woman
as
ugly
as
coralie
was
pretty
lucien
half
unconscious
was
laid
at
last
in
bed
coralie
with
assistance
undressed
the
poet
with
all
a
mother
tender
care
it
is
nothing
he
murmured
again
and
again
it
is
the
air
thank
you
mamma
how
charmingly
he
says
cried
coralie
putting
a
kiss
on
his
hair
what
happiness
to
love
such
an
angel
mademoiselle
where
did
you
pick
him
up
i
did
not
think
a
man
could
be
as
beautiful
as
you
are
said
berenice
when
lucien
lay
in
bed
he
was
very
drowsy
he
knew
nothing
and
saw
nothing
coralie
made
him
swallow
several
cups
of
tea
and
left
him
to
sleep
did
the
porter
see
us
was
there
anyone
else
about
she
asked
no
i
was
sitting
up
for
you
does
victoire
know
anything
rather
not
returned
berenice
ten
hours
later
lucien
awoke
to
meet
coralie
eyes
she
had
watched
by
him
as
he
slept
he
knew
it
poet
that
he
was
it
was
almost
noon
but
she
still
wore
the
delicate
dress
abominably
stained
which
she
meant
to
lay
up
as
a
relic
lucien
understood
all
the
and
delicacy
of
love
fain
of
its
reward
he
looked
into
eyes
in
a
moment
she
had
flung
off
her
clothing
and
slipped
like
a
serpent
to
lucien
side
at
five
in
the
afternoon
lucien
was
still
sleeping
cradled
in
this
voluptuous
paradise
he
had
caught
glimpses
of
coralie
chamber
an
exquisite
creation
of
luxury
a
world
of
and
white
he
had
admired
florine
apartments
but
this
surpassed
them
in
its
dainty
refinement
coralie
had
already
risen
for
if
she
was
to
play
her
part
as
the
andalusian
she
must
be
at
the
theatre
by
seven
yet
she
had
returned
to
gaze
at
the
unconscious
poet
lulled
to
sleep
in
bliss
she
could
not
drink
too
deeply
of
this
love
that
rose
to
rapture
drawing
close
the
bond
between
the
heart
and
the
senses
to
steep
both
in
ecstasy
for
in
that
apotheosis
of
human
passion
which
of
those
that
were
twain
on
earth
that
they
might
know
bliss
to
the
full
creates
one
soul
to
rise
to
love
in
heaven
lay
justification
who
moreover
would
not
have
found
excuse
in
more
than
human
beauty
to
the
actress
kneeling
by
the
bedside
happy
in
love
within
her
it
seemed
that
she
had
received
consecration
berenice
broke
in
upon
coralie
rapture
here
comes
camusot
cried
the
maid
and
he
knows
that
you
are
here
lucien
sprang
up
at
once
innate
generosity
suggested
that
he
was
doing
coralie
an
injury
berenice
drew
aside
a
curtain
and
he
fled
into
a
dainty
whither
coralie
and
the
maid
brought
his
clothes
with
magical
speed
camusot
appeared
and
only
then
did
coralie
eyes
alight
on
boots
warming
in
the
fender
berenice
had
privately
varnished
them
and
put
them
before
the
fire
to
dry
and
both
mistress
and
maid
alike
forgot
that
witness
berenice
left
the
room
with
a
scared
glance
at
coralie
coralie
flung
herself
into
the
depths
of
a
settee
and
bade
camusot
seat
himself
in
the
a
chair
that
stood
opposite
but
coralie
adorer
honest
soul
dared
not
look
his
mistress
in
the
face
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
pair
of
boots
ought
i
to
make
a
scene
and
leave
coralie
he
pondered
is
it
worth
while
to
make
a
fuss
about
a
trifle
there
is
a
pair
of
boots
wherever
you
go
these
would
be
more
in
place
in
a
shop
window
or
taking
a
walk
on
the
boulevard
on
somebody
feet
here
however
without
a
pair
of
feet
in
them
they
tell
a
pretty
plain
tale
i
am
fifty
years
old
and
that
is
the
truth
i
ought
to
be
as
blind
as
cupid
himself
there
was
no
excuse
for
this
monologue
the
boots
were
not
the
at
present
in
vogue
which
an
unobservant
man
may
be
allowed
to
disregard
up
to
a
certain
point
they
were
the
unmistakable
uncompromising
hessians
then
prescribed
by
fashion
a
pair
of
extremely
elegant
betasseled
boots
which
shone
in
glistening
contrast
against
trousers
invariably
of
some
light
color
and
reflected
their
surroundings
like
a
mirror
the
boots
stared
the
honest
out
of
countenance
and
it
must
be
added
they
pained
his
heart
what
is
it
asked
coralie
nothing
ring
the
bell
said
coralie
smiling
to
herself
at
camusot
want
of
berenice
she
said
when
the
norman
handmaid
appeared
just
bring
me
a
for
i
must
put
on
these
confounded
boots
again
do
forget
to
bring
them
to
my
what
boots
faltered
out
camusot
breathing
more
freely
and
whose
should
they
be
she
demanded
haughtily
were
you
beginning
to
believe
great
stupid
oh
and
he
would
believe
it
too
she
went
on
addressing
i
have
a
man
part
in
piece
and
i
have
never
worn
a
man
clothes
in
my
life
before
the
bootmaker
for
the
theatre
brought
me
these
things
to
try
if
i
could
walk
in
them
until
a
pair
can
be
made
to
measure
he
put
them
on
but
they
hurt
me
so
much
that
i
have
taken
them
off
and
after
all
i
must
wear
them
do
put
them
on
again
if
they
are
uncomfortable
said
camusot
the
boots
had
made
him
feel
so
very
uncomfortable
himself
mademoiselle
would
do
better
to
have
a
pair
made
of
very
thin
morocco
sir
instead
of
torturing
herself
as
she
did
just
now
but
the
management
is
so
stingy
she
was
crying
sir
if
i
was
a
man
and
loved
a
woman
i
would
let
her
shed
a
tear
i
know
you
ought
to
order
a
pair
for
her
yes
yes
said
camusot
are
you
just
getting
up
coralie
just
this
moment
i
only
came
in
at
six
after
looking
for
you
everywhere
i
was
obliged
to
keep
the
cab
for
seven
hours
so
much
for
your
care
of
me
you
forget
me
for
a
i
ought
to
take
care
of
myself
now
when
i
am
to
play
every
night
so
long
as
the
draws
i
do
want
to
fall
off
after
that
young
man
notice
of
me
that
is
a
handsome
boy
said
camusot
do
you
think
so
i
do
admire
men
of
that
sort
they
are
too
much
like
women
and
they
do
not
understand
how
to
love
like
you
stupid
old
business
men
you
are
so
bored
with
your
own
society
is
monsieur
dining
with
madame
inquired
berenice
no
my
mouth
is
clammy
you
were
nicely
screwed
yesterday
ah
papa
camusot
i
do
like
men
who
drink
i
tell
you
at
once
you
will
give
that
young
man
a
present
i
suppose
interrupted
camusot
oh
yes
i
would
rather
do
that
than
pay
as
florine
does
there
go
away
with
you
that
one
loves
or
give
me
a
carriage
to
save
time
in
future
you
shall
go
in
your
own
carriage
to
your
manager
dinner
at
the
de
the
new
piece
will
not
be
given
next
sunday
come
i
am
just
going
to
dine
said
coralie
hurrying
camusot
out
of
the
room
an
hour
later
berenice
came
to
release
lucien
berenice
companion
since
her
childhood
had
a
keen
and
subtle
brain
in
her
unwieldy
frame
stay
here
she
said
coralie
is
coming
back
alone
she
even
talked
of
getting
rid
of
camusot
if
he
is
in
your
way
but
you
are
too
much
of
an
angel
to
ruin
her
her
heart
darling
as
you
are
she
wants
to
clear
out
of
this
she
says
to
leave
this
paradise
and
go
and
live
in
your
garret
oh
there
are
those
that
are
jealous
and
envious
of
you
and
they
have
told
her
that
you
have
a
brass
farthing
and
live
in
the
latin
quarter
and
i
should
go
too
you
see
to
do
the
but
i
have
just
been
comforting
her
poor
child
i
have
been
telling
her
that
you
were
too
clever
to
do
anything
so
silly
i

her
soul

old
fool

nothing
but
the

how
nice
she
is
when
i
hear
her
say
her
part
over
my
coralie
my
little
pet
she
is
she
deserved
that
god
in
heaven
should
send
her
one
of
his
angels
she
was
sick
of
the
she
was
so
unhappy
with
her
mother
that
used
to
beat
her
and
sold
her
yes
sir
sold
her
own
child
if
i
had
a
daughter
i
would
wait
on
her
hand
and
foot
as
i
wait
on
coralie
she
is
like
my
own
child
to
these
are
the
first
good
times
she
has
seen
since
i
have
been
with
her
the
first
time
that
she
has
been
really
applauded
you
have
written
something
it
seems
and
they
have
got
up
a
famous
for
the
second
performance
braulard
has
been
going
through
the
play
with
her
while
you
were
asleep
who
braulard
asked
lucien
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
heard
the
name
before
he
is
the
head
of
the
and
she
was
arranging
with
him
the
places
where
she
wished
him
to
look
after
her
florine
might
try
to
play
her
some
shabby
trick
and
take
all
for
herself
for
all
she
calls
herself
her
friend
there
is
such
a
talk
about
your
article
on
the
is
it
a
bed
fit
for
a
prince
she
said
smoothing
the
lace
she
lighted
the
and
to
lucien
bewildered
fancy
the
house
seemed
to
be
some
palace
in
the
des
camusot
had
chosen
the
richest
stuffs
from
the
for
the
hangings
and
a
carpet
fit
for
a
king
palace
was
spread
upon
the
floor
the
carving
of
the
rosewood
furniture
caught
and
imprisoned
the
light
that
rippled
over
its
surface
priceless
trifles
gleamed
from
the
white
marble
the
rug
beside
the
bed
was
of
skins
bordered
with
sable
a
pair
of
little
black
velvet
slippers
lined
with
purple
silk
told
of
happiness
awaiting
the
poet
of
a
dainty
lamp
hung
from
the
ceiling
draped
with
silk
the
room
was
full
of
flowering
plants
delicate
white
heaths
and
scentless
camellias
in
stands
marvelously
wrought
everything
called
up
associations
of
innocence
how
was
it
possible
in
these
rooms
to
see
the
life
that
coralie
led
in
its
true
colors
berenice
noticed
lucien
bewildered
expression
is
it
nice
she
said
coaxingly
you
would
be
more
comfortable
here
would
you
than
in
a
garret
you
wo
let
her
do
anything
rash
she
continued
setting
a
costly
stand
before
him
covered
with
dishes
abstracted
from
her
mistress
lest
the
cook
should
suspect
that
her
mistress
had
a
lover
in
the
house
lucien
made
a
good
dinner
berenice
waiting
on
him
the
dishes
were
of
wrought
silver
the
painted
porcelain
plates
had
cost
a
louis
apiece
the
luxury
was
producing
exactly
the
same
effect
upon
him
that
the
sight
of
a
girl
walking
the
pavement
with
her
bare
flaunting
throat
and
neat
ankles
produces
upon
a
schoolboy
how
lucky
camusot
is
cried
he
lucky
repeated
berenice
he
would
willingly
give
all
that
he
is
worth
to
be
in
your
place
he
would
be
glad
to
barter
his
gray
hair
for
your
golden
head
she
gave
lucien
the
richest
wine
that
bordeaux
keeps
for
the
wealthiest
english
purchaser
and
persuaded
lucien
to
go
to
bed
to
take
a
preliminary
nap
and
lucien
in
truth
was
quite
willing
to
sleep
on
the
couch
that
he
had
been
admiring
berenice
had
read
his
wish
and
felt
glad
for
her
mistress
at
ten
that
night
lucien
awoke
to
look
into
eyes
brimming
over
with
love
there
stood
coralie
in
most
luxurious
night
attire
lucien
had
been
sleeping
lucien
was
intoxicated
with
love
and
not
with
wine
berenice
left
the
room
with
the
inquiry
what
time
morning
at
eleven
we
will
have
breakfast
in
bed
i
am
not
at
home
to
anybody
before
two
at
two
in
the
afternoon
coralie
and
her
lover
were
sitting
together
the
poet
to
all
appearance
had
come
to
pay
a
call
lucien
had
been
bathed
and
combed
and
dressed
coralie
had
sent
to
colliau
for
a
dozen
fine
shirts
a
dozen
cravats
and
a
dozen
for
him
as
well
as
twelve
pairs
of
gloves
in
a
box
when
a
carriage
stopped
at
the
door
they
both
rushed
to
the
window
and
watched
camusot
alight
from
a
handsome
coupe
i
would
not
have
believed
that
one
could
so
hate
a
man
and
luxury
i
am
too
poor
to
allow
you
to
ruin
yourself
for
me
he
replied
and
thus
lucien
passed
under
the
caudine
forks
poor
pet
said
coralie
holding
him
tightly
to
her
do
you
love
me
so
much
i
persuaded
this
gentleman
to
call
on
me
this
morning
she
continued
indicating
lucien
to
camusot
who
entered
the
room
i
thought
that
we
might
take
a
drive
in
the
champs
elysees
to
try
the
carriage
go
without
me
said
camusot
in
a
melancholy
voice
i
shall
not
dine
with
you
it
is
my
wife
birthday
i
had
forgotten
that
poor
musot
how
badly
bored
you
will
be
she
said
putting
her
arms
about
his
neck
she
was
wild
with
joy
at
the
thought
that
she
and
lucien
would
handsel
this
gift
together
she
would
drive
with
him
in
the
new
carriage
and
in
her
happiness
she
seemed
to
love
camusot
she
lavished
caresses
upon
him
if
only
i
could
give
you
a
carriage
every
day
said
the
poor
fellow
now
sir
it
is
two
she
said
turning
to
lucien
who
stood
in
distress
and
confusion
but
she
comforted
him
with
an
adorable
gesture
down
the
stairs
she
went
several
steps
at
a
time
drawing
lucien
after
her
the
elderly
merchant
following
in
their
wake
like
a
seal
on
land
and
quite
unable
to
catch
them
up
lucien
enjoyed
the
most
intoxicating
of
pleasures
happiness
had
increased
coralie
loveliness
to
the
highest
possible
degree
she
appeared
before
all
eyes
an
exquisite
vision
in
her
dainty
toilette
all
paris
in
the
champs
elysees
beheld
the
lovers
in
an
avenue
of
the
bois
de
boulogne
they
met
a
caleche
mme
and
mme
de
bargeton
looked
in
surprise
at
lucien
and
met
a
scornful
glance
from
the
poet
he
saw
glimpses
of
a
great
future
before
him
and
was
about
to
make
his
power
felt
he
could
fling
them
back
in
a
glance
some
of
the
revengeful
thoughts
which
had
gnawed
his
heart
ever
since
they
planted
them
there
that
moment
was
one
of
the
sweetest
in
his
life
and
perhaps
decided
his
fate
once
again
the
furies
seized
on
lucien
at
the
bidding
of
pride
he
would
reappear
in
the
world
of
paris
he
would
take
a
signal
revenge
all
the
social
pettiness
hitherto
trodden
under
foot
by
the
worker
the
member
of
the
brotherhood
sprang
up
again
afresh
in
his
soul
now
he
understood
all
that
lousteau
attack
had
meant
lousteau
had
served
his
passions
while
the
brotherhood
that
collective
mentor
had
seemed
to
mortify
them
in
the
interests
of
tiresome
virtues
and
work
which
began
to
look
useless
and
hopeless
in
lucien
eyes
work
what
is
it
but
death
to
an
eager
nature
and
how
easy
it
is
for
the
man
of
letters
to
slide
into
a
existence
of
into
the
luxurious
ways
of
actresses
and
women
of
easy
virtues
lucien
felt
an
overmastering
desire
to
continue
the
reckless
life
of
the
last
two
days
the
dinner
at
the
de
was
exquisite
all
supper
guests
were
there
except
the
minister
the
duke
and
the
dancer
camusot
too
was
absent
but
these
gaps
were
filled
by
two
famous
actors
and
hector
merlin
and
his
mistress
this
charming
woman
who
chose
to
be
known
as
mme
du
was
the
handsomest
and
most
fashionable
of
the
class
of
women
now
euphemistically
styled
lucien
had
spent
the
hours
since
the
success
of
his
article
in
paradise
he
was
feted
and
envied
he
gained
his
talk
sparkled
he
was
the
brilliant
lucien
de
rubempre
who
shone
for
a
few
months
in
the
world
of
letters
and
art
finot
with
his
infallible
instinct
for
discovering
ability
scenting
it
afar
as
an
ogre
might
scent
human
flesh
cajoled
lucien
and
did
his
best
to
secure
a
recruit
for
the
squadron
under
his
command
and
coralie
watched
the
manoeuvres
of
this
purveyor
of
brains
saw
that
lucien
was
nibbling
at
the
bait
and
tried
to
put
him
on
his
guard
do
make
any
engagement
dear
boy
wait
they
want
to
exploit
you
we
will
talk
of
it
pshaw
said
lucien
i
am
sure
i
am
quite
as
sharp
and
shrewd
as
they
can
be
finot
and
hector
merlin
evidently
had
not
fallen
out
over
that
affair
of
the
white
lines
and
spaces
in
the
columns
for
it
was
finot
who
introduced
lucien
to
the
journalist
coralie
and
mme
du
were
overwhelmingly
amiable
and
polite
to
each
other
and
mme
du
asked
lucien
and
coralie
to
dine
with
her
hector
merlin
short
and
thin
with
lips
always
tightly
compressed
was
the
most
dangerous
journalist
present
unbounded
ambition
and
jealousy
smouldered
within
him
he
took
pleasure
in
the
pain
of
others
and
fomented
strife
to
turn
it
to
his
own
account
his
abilities
were
but
slender
and
he
had
little
force
of
character
but
the
natural
instinct
which
draws
the
upstart
towards
money
and
power
served
him
as
well
as
fixity
of
purpose
lucien
and
merlin
at
once
took
a
dislike
to
one
another
for
reasons
not
far
to
seek
merlin
unfortunately
proclaimed
aloud
the
thoughts
that
lucien
kept
to
himself
by
the
time
the
dessert
was
put
on
the
table
the
most
touching
friendship
appeared
to
prevail
among
the
men
each
one
of
whom
in
his
heart
thought
himself
a
cleverer
fellow
than
the
rest
and
lucien
as
the
newcomer
was
made
much
of
by
them
all
they
chatted
frankly
and
unrestrainedly
hector
merlin
alone
did
not
join
in
the
laughter
lucien
asked
the
reason
of
his
reserve
you
are
just
entering
the
world
of
letters
i
can
see
he
said
you
are
a
journalist
with
all
your
illusions
left
you
believe
in
friendship
here
we
are
friends
or
foes
as
it
happens
we
strike
down
a
friend
with
the
weapon
which
by
rights
should
only
be
turned
against
an
enemy
you
will
find
out
before
very
long
that
fine
sentiments
will
do
nothing
for
you
if
you
are
naturally
kindly
learn
to
be
to
be
consistently
spiteful
if
you
have
never
heard
this
golden
rule
before
i
give
it
you
now
in
confidence
and
it
is
no
small
secret
if
you
have
a
mind
to
be
loved
never
leave
your
mistress
until
you
have
made
her
shed
a
tear
or
two
and
if
you
mean
to
make
your
way
in
literature
let
other
people
continually
feel
your
teeth
make
no
exception
even
of
your
friends
wound
their
susceptibilities
and
everybody
will
fawn
upon
you
hector
merlin
watched
lucien
as
he
spoke
saw
that
his
words
went
to
the
neophyte
heart
like
a
stab
and
hector
merlin
was
glad
play
followed
lucien
lost
all
his
money
and
coralie
brought
him
away
and
he
forgot
for
a
while
in
the
delights
of
love
the
fierce
excitement
of
the
gambler
which
was
to
gain
so
strong
a
hold
upon
him
when
he
left
coralie
in
the
morning
and
returned
to
the
latin
quarter
he
took
out
his
purse
and
found
the
money
he
had
lost
at
first
he
felt
miserable
over
the
discovery
and
thought
of
going
back
at
once
to
return
a
gift
which
humiliated
him
but
he
had
already
come
as
far
as
the
rue
de
la
harpe
he
would
not
return
now
that
he
had
almost
reached
the
hotel
de
cluny
he
pondered
over
coralie
forethought
as
he
went
till
he
saw
in
it
a
proof
of
the
maternal
love
which
is
blended
with
passion
in
women
of
her
stamp
for
coralie
and
her
like
passion
includes
every
human
affection
lucien
went
from
thought
to
thought
and
argued
himself
into
accepting
the
gift
i
love
her
he
said
we
shall
live
together
as
husband
and
wife
i
will
never
forsake
her
what
mortal
short
of
a
diogenes
could
fail
to
understand
feelings
as
he
climbed
the
dirty
fetid
staircase
to
his
lodging
turned
the
key
that
grated
in
the
lock
and
entered
and
looked
round
at
the
unswept
brick
floor
at
the
cheerless
grate
at
the
ugly
poverty
and
bareness
of
the
room
a
package
of
manuscript
was
lying
on
the
table
it
was
his
novel
a
note
from
daniel
lay
beside
it
our
friends
are
almost
satisfied
with
your
work
dear
poet
wrote
you
will
be
able
to
present
it
with
more
confidence
now
they
say
to
friends
and
enemies
we
saw
your
charming
article
on
the
you
are
sure
to
excite
as
much
jealousy
in
the
profession
as
regret
among
your
friends
here
daniel
regrets
what
does
he
mean
exclaimed
lucien
the
polite
tone
of
the
note
astonished
him
was
he
to
be
henceforth
a
stranger
to
the
brotherhood
he
had
learned
to
set
a
higher
value
on
the
good
opinion
and
the
friendship
of
the
circle
in
the
rue
des
since
he
had
tasted
of
the
delicious
fruits
offered
to
him
by
the
eve
of
the
theatrical
underworld
for
some
moments
he
stood
in
deep
thought
he
saw
his
present
in
the
garret
and
foresaw
his
future
in
rooms
honorable
resolution
struggled
with
temptation
and
swayed
him
now
this
way
now
that
he
sat
down
and
began
to
look
through
his
manuscript
to
see
in
what
condition
his
friends
had
returned
it
to
him
what
was
his
amazement
as
he
read
chapter
after
chapter
to
find
his
poverty
transmuted
into
riches
by
the
cunning
of
the
pen
and
the
devotion
of
the
unknown
great
men
his
friends
of
the
brotherhood
dialogue
closely
packed
nervous
pregnant
terse
and
full
of
the
spirit
of
the
age
replaced
his
conversations
which
seemed
poor
and
pointless
prattle
in
comparison
his
characters
a
little
uncertain
in
the
drawing
now
stood
out
in
vigorous
contrast
of
color
and
relief
physiological
observations
due
no
doubt
to
horace
bianchon
supplied
links
of
interpretations
between
human
character
and
the
curious
phenomena
of
human
life
subtle
touches
which
made
his
men
and
women
live
his
wordy
passages
of
description
were
condensed
and
vivid
the
misshapen
child
of
his
brain
had
returned
to
him
as
a
lovely
maiden
with
white
robes
and
girdle
and
scarf
an
entrancing
creation
night
fell
and
took
him
by
surprise
reading
through
rising
tears
stricken
to
earth
by
such
greatness
of
soul
feeling
the
worth
of
such
a
lesson
admiring
the
alterations
which
taught
him
more
of
literature
and
art
than
all
his
four
years
apprenticeship
of
study
and
reading
and
comparison
a
master
correction
of
a
line
made
upon
the
study
always
teaches
more
than
all
the
theories
and
criticisms
in
the
world
what
friends
are
these
what
hearts
how
fortunate
i
am
he
cried
grasping
his
manuscript
tightly
with
the
quick
impulsiveness
of
a
poetic
and
mobile
temperament
he
rushed
off
to
daniel
lodging
as
he
climbed
the
stairs
and
thought
of
these
friends
who
refused
to
leave
the
path
of
honor
he
felt
conscious
that
he
was
less
worthy
of
them
than
before
a
voice
spoke
within
him
telling
him
that
if
had
loved
coralie
he
would
have
had
her
break
with
camusot
and
besides
this
he
knew
that
the
brotherhood
held
journalism
in
utter
abhorrence
and
that
he
himself
was
already
to
some
small
extent
a
journalist
all
of
them
except
meyraux
who
had
just
gone
out
were
in
room
when
he
entered
it
and
saw
that
all
their
faces
were
full
of
sorrow
and
despair
what
is
it
he
cried
we
have
just
heard
news
of
a
dreadful
catastrophe
the
greatest
thinker
of
the
age
our
most
loved
friend
who
was
like
a
light
among
us
for
two
years

lambert
has
fallen
a
victim
to
catalepsy
there
is
no
hope
for
him
said
bianchon
he
will
die
his
soul
wandering
in
the
skies
his
body
unconscious
on
earth
said
michel
chrestien
solemnly
he
will
die
as
he
lived
said
love
fell
like
a
firebrand
in
the
vast
empire
of
his
brain
and
burned
him
away
said
leon
giraud
yes
said
joseph
bridau
he
has
reached
a
height
that
we
can
not
so
much
as
see
are
to
be
pitied
not
louis
said
fulgence
ridal
perhaps
he
will
recover
exclaimed
lucien
from
what
meyraux
has
been
telling
us
recovery
seems
impossible
answered
bianchon
medicine
has
no
power
over
the
change
that
is
working
in
his
brain
yet
there
are
physical
means
said
yes
said
bianchon
we
might
produce
imbecility
instead
of
catalepsy
is
there
no
way
of
offering
another
head
to
the
spirit
of
evil
i
would
give
mine
to
save
him
cried
michel
chrestien
and
what
would
become
of
european
federation
asked
ah
true
replied
michel
chrestien
our
duty
to
humanity
comes
first
to
one
man
afterwards
i
came
here
with
a
heart
full
of
gratitude
to
you
all
said
lucien
you
have
changed
my
alloy
into
golden
coin
gratitude
for
what
do
you
take
us
asked
bianchon
we
had
the
pleasure
added
fulgence
well
so
you
are
a
journalist
are
you
asked
leon
giraud
the
fame
of
your
first
appearance
has
reached
even
the
latin
quarter
i
am
not
a
journalist
yet
returned
lucien
aha
so
much
the
better
said
michel
chrestien
i
told
you
so
said
lucien
knows
the
value
of
a
clean
conscience
when
you
can
say
to
yourself
as
you
lay
your
head
on
the
pillow
at
night
have
not
sat
in
judgment
on
another
man
work
i
have
given
pain
to
no
one
i
have
not
used
the
edge
of
my
wit
to
deal
a
stab
to
some
harmless
soul
i
have
sacrificed
no
one
success
to
a
jest
i
have
not
even
troubled
the
happiness
of
imbecility
i
have
not
added
to
the
burdens
of
genius
i
have
scorned
the
easy
triumphs
of
epigram
in
short
i
have
not
acted
against
my
convictions
is
not
this
a
viaticum
that
gives
one
daily
strength
but
one
can
say
all
this
surely
and
yet
work
on
a
newspaper
said
lucien
if
i
had
absolutely
no
other
way
of
earning
a
living
i
should
certainly
come
to
this
oh
oh
oh
cried
fulgence
his
voice
rising
a
note
each
time
we
are
capitulating
are
we
he
will
turn
journalist
leon
giraud
said
gravely
oh
lucien
if
you
would
only
stay
and
work
with
us
we
are
about
to
bring
out
a
periodical
in
which
justice
and
truth
shall
never
be
violated
we
will
spread
doctrines
that
perhaps
will
be
of
real
service
to
mankind
you
will
not
have
a
single
subscriber
lucien
broke
in
with
machiavellian
wisdom
there
will
be
five
hundred
of
them
asserted
michel
chrestien
but
they
will
be
worth
five
hundred
thousand
you
will
need
a
lot
of
capital
continued
lucien
no
only
devotion
said
anybody
might
take
him
for
a
perfumer
assistant
burst
out
michel
chrestien
looking
at
lucien
head
and
sniffing
comically
you
were
seen
driving
about
in
a
very
smart
turnout
with
a
pair
of
thoroughbreds
and
a
mistress
for
a
prince
coralie
herself
well
and
is
there
any
harm
in
it
you
would
not
say
that
if
you
thought
that
there
was
no
harm
in
it
said
bianchon
i
could
have
wished
lucien
a
beatrice
said
a
noble
woman
who
would
have
been
a
help
to
him
in
life
but
daniel
asked
lucien
love
is
love
wherever
you
find
it
is
it
not
ah
said
the
republican
member
on
that
one
point
i
am
an
aristocrat
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
love
a
woman
who
must
rub
shoulders
with
all
sorts
of
people
in
the
whom
an
actor
kisses
on
stage
she
must
lower
herself
before
the
public
smile
on
every
one
lift
her
skirts
as
she
dances
and
dress
like
a
man
that
all
the
world
may
see
what
none
should
see
save
i
alone
or
if
i
loved
such
a
woman
she
should
leave
the
stage
and
my
love
should
cleanse
her
from
the
stain
of
it
and
if
she
would
not
leave
the
stage
i
should
die
of
mortification
jealousy
and
all
sorts
of
pain
you
can
not
pluck
love
out
of
your
heart
as
you
draw
a
tooth
lucien
face
grew
dark
and
thoughtful
when
they
find
out
that
i
am
tolerating
camusot
how
they
will
despise
me
he
thought
look
here
said
the
fierce
republican
with
humorous
fierceness
you
can
be
a
great
writer
but
a
little
you
shall
never
be
and
he
took
up
his
hat
and
went
out
he
is
hard
is
michel
chrestien
commented
lucien
hard
and
salutary
like
the
dentist
pincers
said
bianchon
michel
foresees
your
future
perhaps
in
the
street
at
this
moment
he
is
thinking
of
you
with
tears
in
his
eyes
was
kind
and
talked
comfortingly
and
tried
to
cheer
lucien
the
poet
spent
an
hour
with
his
friends
then
he
went
but
his
conscience
treated
him
hardly
crying
to
him
you
will
be
a
journalist
a
journalist
as
the
witch
cried
to
macbeth
that
he
should
be
king
hereafter
out
in
the
street
he
looked
up
at
windows
and
saw
a
faint
light
shining
in
them
and
his
heart
sank
a
dim
foreboding
told
him
that
he
had
bidden
his
friends
for
the
last
time
as
he
turned
out
of
the
place
de
la
sorbonne
into
the
rue
de
cluny
he
saw
a
carriage
at
the
door
of
his
lodging
coralie
had
driven
all
the
way
from
the
boulevard
du
temple
for
the
sake
of
a
moment
with
her
lover
and
a
lucien
found
her
sobbing
in
his
garret
she
would
be
as
wretchedly
poor
as
her
poet
she
wept
as
she
arranged
his
shirts
and
gloves
and
handkerchiefs
in
the
crazy
chest
of
drawers
her
distress
was
so
real
and
so
great
that
lucien
but
even
now
chidden
for
his
connection
with
an
actress
saw
coralie
as
a
saint
ready
to
assume
the
of
poverty
the
adorable
girl
excuse
for
her
visit
was
an
announcement
that
the
firm
of
camusot
coralie
and
lucien
meant
to
invite
matifat
florine
and
lousteau
the
second
trio
to
supper
had
lucien
any
invitations
to
issue
to
people
who
might
be
useful
to
him
lucien
said
that
he
would
take
counsel
of
lousteau
a
few
moments
were
spent
together
and
coralie
hurried
away
she
spared
lucien
the
knowledge
that
camusot
was
waiting
for
her
below
next
morning
at
eight
lucien
went
to
etienne
room
found
it
empty
and
hurried
away
to
florine
lousteau
and
florine
settled
into
possession
of
their
new
quarters
like
a
married
couple
received
their
friend
in
the
pretty
bedroom
and
all
three
breakfasted
sumptuously
together
why
i
should
advise
you
my
boy
to
come
with
me
to
see
felicien
vernou
said
lousteau
when
they
sat
at
table
and
lucien
had
mentioned
coralie
projected
supper
ask
him
to
be
of
the
party
and
keep
well
with
him
if
you
can
keep
well
with
such
a
rascal
felicien
vernou
does
a
for
a
political
paper
he
might
perhaps
introduce
you
and
you
could
blossom
out
into
leaders
in
it
at
your
ease
it
is
a
liberal
paper
like
ours
you
will
be
a
liberal
that
is
the
popular
party
and
besides
if
you
mean
to
go
over
to
the
ministerialists
you
would
do
better
for
yourself
if
they
had
reason
to
be
afraid
of
you
then
there
is
hector
merlin
and
his
mme
du
you
meet
great
people
at
their
house
dukes
and
dandies
and
millionaires
did
they
ask
you
and
coralie
to
dine
with
them
yes
replied
lucien
you
are
going
too
and
so
is
florine
lucien
and
etienne
were
now
on
familiar
terms
after
friday
debauch
and
the
dinner
at
the
de
very
well
merlin
is
on
the
paper
we
shall
come
across
him
pretty
often
he
is
the
chap
to
follow
close
on
finot
heels
you
would
do
well
to
pay
him
attention
ask
him
and
mme
du
to
supper
he
may
be
useful
to
you
before
long
for
rancorous
people
are
always
in
need
of
others
and
he
may
do
you
a
good
turn
if
he
can
reckon
on
your
pen
your
beginning
has
made
enough
sensation
to
smooth
your
way
said
florine
take
advantage
of
it
at
once
or
you
will
soon
be
forgotten
the
bargain
the
great
business
is
concluded
lousteau
continued
that
finot
without
a
spark
of
talent
in
him
is
to
be
editor
of
dauriat
weekly
paper
with
a
salary
of
six
hundred
francs
per
month
and
owner
of
a
sixth
share
for
which
he
has
not
paid
one
penny
and
i
my
dear
fellow
am
now
editor
of
our
little
paper
everything
went
off
as
i
expected
florine
managed
superbly
she
could
give
points
to
tallyrand
himself
we
have
a
hold
on
men
through
their
pleasures
said
florine
while
a
diplomatist
only
works
on
their
a
diplomatist
sees
a
man
made
up
for
the
occasion
we
know
him
in
his
moments
of
folly
so
our
power
is
greater
and
when
the
thing
was
settled
matifat
made
the
first
and
last
joke
of
his
whole
druggist
career
put
in
lousteau
he
said
affair
is
quite
in
my
line
i
am
supplying
drugs
to
the
public
i
suspect
that
florine
put
him
up
to
it
cried
lucien
and
by
these
means
my
little
dear
your
foot
is
in
the
stirrup
continued
lousteau
you
were
born
with
a
silver
spoon
in
your
mouth
remarked
florine
what
lots
of
young
fellows
wait
for
years
wait
till
they
are
sick
of
waiting
for
a
chance
to
get
an
article
into
a
paper
you
will
do
like
emile
blondet
in
six
months
time
you
will
be
giving
yourself
high
and
mighty
airs
she
added
with
a
mocking
smile
in
the
language
of
her
class
have
i
been
in
paris
for
three
years
said
lousteau
and
only
yesterday
finot
began
to
pay
me
a
fixed
monthly
salary
of
three
hundred
francs
and
a
hundred
francs
per
sheet
for
his
paper
well
you
are
saying
nothing
exclaimed
florine
with
her
eyes
turned
on
lucien
we
shall
see
said
lucien
my
dear
boy
if
you
had
been
my
brother
i
could
not
have
done
more
for
you
retorted
lousteau
somewhat
nettled
but
i
wo
answer
for
finot
scores
of
sharp
fellows
will
besiege
finot
for
the
next
two
days
with
offers
to
work
for
low
pay
i
have
promised
for
you
but
you
can
draw
back
if
you
you
little
know
how
lucky
you
are
he
added
after
a
pause
all
those
in
our
set
combine
to
attack
an
enemy
in
various
papers
and
lend
each
other
a
helping
hand
all
round
let
us
go
in
the
first
place
to
felicien
vernou
said
lucien
he
was
eager
to
conclude
an
alliance
with
such
formidable
birds
of
prey
lousteau
sent
for
a
cab
and
the
pair
of
friends
drove
to
house
on
the
second
floor
up
an
alley
in
the
rue
mandar
to
great
astonishment
the
harsh
fastidious
and
severe
surroundings
were
vulgar
to
the
last
degree
a
marbled
paper
cheap
and
shabby
with
a
meaningless
pattern
repeated
at
regular
intervals
covered
the
walls
and
a
series
of
aqua
tints
in
gilt
frames
decorated
the
apartment
where
vernou
sat
at
table
with
a
woman
so
plain
that
she
could
only
be
the
legitimate
mistress
of
the
house
and
two
very
small
children
perched
on
high
chairs
with
a
bar
in
front
to
prevent
the
infants
from
tumbling
out
felicien
vernou
in
a
cotton
contrived
out
of
the
remains
of
one
of
his
dresses
was
not
over
well
pleased
by
this
invasion
have
you
breakfasted
lousteau
he
asked
placing
a
chair
for
lucien
we
have
just
left
florine
we
have
been
breakfasting
with
her
lucien
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
mme
vernou
she
looked
like
a
stout
homely
cook
with
a
tolerably
fair
complexion
but
commonplace
to
the
last
degree
the
lady
wore
a
bandana
tied
over
her
the
strings
of
the
latter
article
of
dress
being
tied
so
tightly
under
the
chin
that
her
puffy
cheeks
stood
out
on
either
side
a
shapeless
beltless
garment
fastened
by
a
single
button
at
the
throat
enveloped
her
from
head
to
foot
in
such
a
fashion
that
a
comparison
to
a
milestone
at
once
suggested
itself
her
health
left
no
room
for
hope
her
cheeks
were
almost
purple
her
fingers
looked
like
sausages
in
a
moment
it
dawned
upon
lucien
how
it
was
that
vernou
was
always
so
ill
at
ease
in
society
here
was
the
living
explanation
of
his
misanthropy
sick
of
his
marriage
unable
to
bring
himself
to
abandon
his
wife
and
family
he
had
yet
sufficient
of
the
artistic
temper
to
suffer
continually
from
their
presence
vernou
was
an
actor
by
nature
bound
never
to
pardon
the
success
of
another
condemned
to
chronic
discontent
because
he
was
never
content
with
himself
lucien
began
to
understand
the
sour
look
which
seemed
to
add
to
the
bleak
expression
of
envy
on
vernou
face
the
acerbity
of
the
epigrams
with
which
his
conversation
was
sown
the
journalist
pungent
phrases
keen
and
elaborately
wrought
as
a
stiletto
were
at
once
explained
let
us
go
into
my
study
vernou
said
rising
from
the
table
you
have
come
on
business
no
doubt
yes
and
no
replied
etienne
lousteau
it
is
a
supper
old
chap
i
have
brought
a
message
from
coralie
said
lucien
mme
vernou
looked
up
at
once
at
the
name
to
ask
you
to
supper
at
her
house
to
meet
the
same
company
as
before
at
florine
and
a
few
more
besides
hector
merlin
and
mme
du
and
some
others
there
will
be
play
afterwards
but
we
are
engaged
to
mme
mahoudeau
this
evening
dear
put
in
the
wife
what
does
that
matter
returned
vernou
she
will
take
offence
if
we
do
go
and
you
are
very
glad
of
her
when
you
have
a
bill
to
discount
this
wife
of
mine
my
dear
boy
can
never
be
made
to
understand
that
a
supper
engagement
for
twelve
does
not
prevent
you
from
going
to
an
evening
party
that
comes
to
an
end
at
eleven
she
is
always
with
me
while
i
work
he
added
you
have
so
much
imagination
said
lucien
and
thereby
made
a
mortal
enemy
of
vernou
well
continued
lousteau
you
are
coming
but
that
is
not
all
de
rubempre
is
about
to
be
one
of
us
so
you
must
push
him
in
your
paper
give
him
out
for
a
chap
that
will
make
a
name
for
himself
in
literature
so
that
he
can
put
in
at
least
a
couple
of
articles
every
month
yes
if
he
means
to
be
one
of
us
and
will
attack
our
enemies
as
we
will
attack
his
i
will
say
a
word
for
him
at
the
opera
replied
vernou
very
well
till
my
boy
said
lousteau
shaking
hands
with
every
sign
of
cordiality
when
is
your
book
coming
out
that
depends
on
dauriat
it
is
ready
said
vernou
are
you
satisfied
yes
and
no
we
will
get
up
a
success
said
lousteau
and
he
rose
with
a
bow
to
his
colleague
wife
the
abrupt
departure
was
necessary
indeed
for
the
two
infants
engaged
in
a
noisy
quarrel
were
fighting
with
their
spoons
and
flinging
the
pap
in
each
other
faces
that
my
boy
is
a
woman
who
all
unconsciously
will
work
great
havoc
in
contemporary
literature
said
etienne
when
they
came
away
poor
vernou
can
not
forgive
us
for
his
wife
he
ought
to
be
relieved
of
her
in
the
interests
of
the
public
and
a
deluge
of
reviews
and
stinging
sarcasms
against
successful
men
of
every
sort
would
be
averted
what
is
to
become
of
a
man
with
such
a
wife
and
that
pair
of
abominable
brats
have
you
seen
rigaudin
in
picard
maison
en
you
have
well
like
rigaudin
vernou
will
not
fight
himself
but
he
will
set
others
fighting
he
would
give
an
eye
to
put
out
both
eyes
in
the
head
of
the
best
friend
he
has
you
will
see
him
using
the
bodies
of
the
slain
for
a
rejoicing
over
every
misfortunes
attacking
princes
dukes
marquises
and
nobles
because
he
himself
is
a
commoner
reviling
the
work
of
unmarried
men
because
he
forsooth
has
a
wife
and
everlastingly
preaching
morality
the
joys
of
domestic
life
and
the
duties
of
the
citizen
in
short
this
very
moral
critic
will
spare
no
one
not
even
infants
of
tender
age
he
lives
in
the
rue
mandar
with
a
wife
who
might
be
the
of
the
and
a
couple
of
little
vernous
as
ugly
as
sin
he
tries
to
sneer
at
the
faubourg
where
he
will
never
set
foot
and
makes
his
duchesses
talk
like
his
wife
that
is
the
sort
of
man
to
raise
a
howl
at
the
jesuits
insult
the
court
and
credit
the
court
party
with
the
design
of
restoring
feudal
rights
and
the
right
of
primogeniture
just
the
one
to
preach
a
crusade
for
equality
he
that
thinks
himself
the
equal
of
no
one
if
he
were
a
bachelor
he
would
go
into
society
if
he
were
in
a
fair
way
to
be
a
royalist
poet
with
a
pension
and
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
he
would
be
an
optimist
and
journalism
offers
by
the
hundred
journalism
is
the
giant
catapult
set
in
motion
by
pigmy
hatreds
have
you
any
wish
to
marry
after
this
vernou
has
none
of
the
milk
of
human
kindness
in
him
it
is
all
turned
to
gall
and
he
is
emphatically
the
journalist
a
tiger
with
two
hands
that
tears
everything
to
pieces
as
if
his
pen
had
the
hydrophobia
it
is
a
case
of
gunophobia
said
lucien
has
he
ability
he
is
witty
he
is
a
writer
of
articles
he
incubates
articles
he
does
that
all
his
life
and
nothing
else
the
most
dogged
industry
would
fail
to
graft
a
book
on
his
prose
felicien
is
incapable
of
conceiving
a
work
on
a
large
scale
of
broad
effects
of
fitting
characters
harmoniously
in
a
plot
which
develops
till
it
reaches
a
climax
he
has
ideas
but
he
has
no
knowledge
of
facts
his
heroes
are
utopian
creatures
philosophical
or
liberal
notions
masquerading
he
is
at
pains
to
write
an
original
style
but
his
inflated
periods
would
collapse
at
a
from
a
critic
and
therefore
he
goes
in
terror
of
reviews
like
every
one
else
who
can
only
keep
his
head
above
water
with
the
bladders
of
newspaper
puffs
what
an
article
you
are
making
out
of
him
that
particular
kind
my
boy
must
be
spoken
and
never
written
you
are
turning
editor
said
lucien
where
shall
i
put
you
down
at
coralie
ah
we
are
infatuated
said
lousteau
what
a
mistake
do
as
i
do
with
florine
let
coralie
be
your
housekeeper
and
take
your
fling
you
would
send
a
saint
to
perdition
laughed
lucien
well
there
is
no
damning
a
devil
retorted
lousteau
the
flippant
tone
the
brilliant
talk
of
this
new
friend
his
views
of
life
his
paradoxes
the
axioms
of
parisian
machiavelism
all
these
things
impressed
lucien
unawares
theoretically
the
poet
knew
that
such
thoughts
were
perilous
but
he
believed
them
practically
useful
arrived
in
the
boulevard
du
temple
the
friends
agreed
to
meet
at
the
office
between
four
and
five
hector
merlin
would
doubtless
be
there
lousteau
was
right
the
infatuation
of
desire
was
upon
lucien
for
the
courtesan
who
loves
knows
how
to
grapple
her
lover
to
her
by
every
weakness
in
his
nature
fashioning
herself
with
incredible
flexibility
to
his
every
wish
encouraging
the
soft
effeminate
habits
which
strengthen
her
hold
lucien
was
thirsting
already
for
enjoyment
he
was
in
love
with
the
easy
luxurious
and
expensive
life
which
the
actress
led
he
found
coralie
and
camusot
intoxicated
with
joy
the
gymnase
offered
coralie
an
engagement
after
easter
on
terms
for
which
she
had
never
dared
to
hope
and
this
great
success
is
owing
to
you
said
camusot
yes
surely
would
have
fallen
flat
but
for
him
cried
coralie
if
there
had
been
no
article
i
should
have
been
in
for
another
six
years
of
the
boulevard
theatres
she
danced
up
to
lucien
and
flung
her
arms
round
him
putting
an
indescribable
silken
softness
and
sweetness
into
her
enthusiasm
love
had
come
to
coralie
and
camusot
his
eyes
fell
looking
down
after
the
wont
of
mankind
in
moments
of
sharp
pain
he
saw
the
seam
of
lucien
boots
a
deep
yellow
thread
used
by
the
best
bootmakers
of
that
time
in
strong
contrast
with
the
glistening
leather
the
color
of
that
seam
had
tinged
his
thoughts
during
a
previous
conversation
with
himself
as
he
sought
to
explain
the
presence
of
a
mysterious
pair
of
hessians
in
coralie
fender
he
remembered
now
that
he
had
seen
the
name
of
gay
rue
de
la
michodiere
printed
in
black
letters
on
the
soft
white
kid
lining
you
have
a
handsome
pair
of
boots
sir
he
said
like
everything
else
about
him
said
coralie
i
should
be
very
glad
of
your
bootmaker
address
oh
how
like
the
rue
des
bourdonnais
to
ask
for
a
address
cried
coralie
do
intend
to
patronize
a
young
bootmaker
a
nice
young
man
you
would
make
do
keep
to
your
own
they
are
the
kind
for
a
man
with
a
wife
and
family
and
a
mistress
indeed
if
you
would
take
off
one
of
your
boots
sir
i
should
be
very
much
obliged
persisted
camusot
i
could
not
get
it
on
again
without
a
said
lucien
flushing
up
berenice
will
fetch
you
one
we
can
do
with
some
here
jeered
camusot
papa
camusot
said
coralie
looking
at
him
with
cruel
scorn
have
the
courage
of
your
pitiful
baseness
come
speak
out
you
think
that
this
gentleman
boots
are
very
like
mine
do
you
not
i
forbid
you
to
take
off
your
boots
she
added
turning
to
yes
camusot
yes
you
saw
some
boots
lying
about
in
the
fender
here
the
other
day
and
that
is
the
identical
pair
and
this
gentleman
was
hiding
in
my
at
the
time
waiting
for
them
and
he
had
passed
the
night
here
that
was
what
you
were
thinking
think
so
i
would
rather
you
did
it
is
the
simple
truth
i
am
deceiving
you
and
if
i
am
i
do
it
to
please
myself
she
sat
down
there
was
no
anger
in
her
face
no
embarrassment
she
looked
from
camusot
to
lucien
the
two
men
avoided
each
other
eyes
i
will
believe
nothing
that
you
do
not
wish
me
to
believe
said
camusot
do
play
with
me
coralie
i
was
wrong
i
am
either
a
shameless
baggage
that
has
taken
a
sudden
fancy
or
a
poor
unhappy
girl
who
feels
what
love
really
is
for
the
first
time
the
love
that
all
women
long
for
and
whichever
way
it
is
you
must
leave
me
or
take
me
as
i
am
she
said
with
a
queenly
gesture
that
crushed
camusot
is
it
really
true
he
asked
seeing
from
their
faces
that
this
was
no
jest
yet
begging
to
be
deceived
i
love
mademoiselle
lucien
faltered
out
at
that
word
coralie
sprang
to
her
poet
and
held
him
tightly
to
her
then
with
her
arms
still
about
him
she
turned
to
the
as
if
to
bid
him
see
the
beautiful
picture
made
by
two
young
lovers
poor
musot
take
all
that
you
gave
to
me
back
again
i
do
not
want
to
keep
anything
of
yours
for
i
love
this
boy
here
madly
not
for
his
intellect
but
for
his
beauty
i
would
rather
starve
with
him
than
have
millions
with
you
camusot
sank
into
a
low
chair
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
and
said
not
a
word
would
you
like
us
to
go
away
she
asked
there
was
a
note
of
ferocity
in
her
voice
which
no
words
can
describe
cold
chills
ran
down
lucien
spine
he
beheld
himself
burdened
with
a
woman
an
actress
and
a
household
stay
here
coralie
keep
it
all
the
old
tradesman
said
at
last
in
a
faint
unsteady
voice
that
came
from
his
heart
i
do
want
anything
back
there
is
the
worth
of
sixty
thousand
francs
here
in
the
furniture
but
i
could
not
bear
to
think
of
my
coralie
in
want
and
yet
it
will
not
be
long
before
you
come
to
want
however
great
this
gentleman
talent
may
be
he
ca
afford
to
keep
you
we
old
fellows
must
expect
this
sort
of
thing
coralie
let
me
come
and
see
you
sometimes
i
may
be
of
use
to
you
and
i
confess
it
i
can
not
live
without
you
the
poor
man
gentleness
stripped
as
he
was
of
his
happiness
just
as
happiness
had
reached
its
height
touched
lucien
deeply
coralie
was
quite
unsoftened
by
it
come
as
often
as
you
wish
poor
musot
she
said
i
shall
like
you
all
the
better
when
i
do
pretend
to
love
you
camusot
seemed
to
be
resigned
to
his
fate
so
long
as
he
was
not
driven
out
of
the
earthly
paradise
in
which
his
life
could
not
have
been
all
joy
he
trusted
to
the
chances
of
life
in
paris
and
to
the
temptations
that
would
beset
lucien
path
he
would
wait
a
while
and
all
that
had
been
his
should
be
his
again
sooner
or
later
thought
the
wily
tradesman
this
handsome
young
fellow
would
be
unfaithful
he
would
keep
a
watch
on
him
and
the
better
to
do
this
and
use
his
opportunity
with
coralie
he
would
be
their
friend
the
persistent
passion
that
could
consent
to
such
humiliation
terrified
lucien
camusot
proposal
of
a
dinner
at
very
in
the
palais
royal
was
accepted
what
joy
cried
coralie
as
soon
as
camusot
had
departed
you
will
not
go
back
now
to
your
garret
in
the
latin
quarter
you
will
live
here
we
shall
always
be
together
you
can
take
a
room
in
the
rue
charlot
for
the
sake
of
appearances
and
le
she
began
to
dance
her
spanish
dance
with
an
excited
eagerness
that
revealed
the
strength
of
the
passion
in
her
heart
if
i
work
hard
i
may
make
five
hundred
francs
a
month
lucien
said
and
i
shall
make
as
much
again
at
the
theatre
without
counting
extras
camusot
will
pay
for
my
dresses
as
before
he
is
fond
of
me
we
can
live
like
croesus
on
fifteen
hundred
francs
a
month
and
the
horses
and
the
coachman
and
the
footman
inquired
berenice
i
will
get
into
debt
said
coralie
and
she
began
to
dance
with
lucien
i
must
close
with
finot
after
this
lucien
exclaimed
there
said
coralie
i
will
dress
and
take
you
to
your
office
i
will
wait
outside
in
the
boulevard
for
you
with
the
carriage
lucien
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
made
some
very
sober
reflections
as
he
watched
coralie
at
her
toilet
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
leave
coralie
free
than
to
start
all
at
once
with
such
an
establishment
but
coralie
was
there
before
his
eyes
and
coralie
was
so
lovely
so
graceful
so
bewitching
that
the
more
picturesque
aspects
of
bohemia
were
in
evidence
and
he
flung
down
the
gauntlet
to
fortune
berenice
was
ordered
to
superintend
lucien
removal
and
installation
and
coralie
triumphant
radiant
and
happy
carried
off
her
love
her
poet
and
must
needs
go
all
over
paris
on
the
way
to
the
rue
lucien
sprang
lightly
up
the
staircase
and
entered
the
office
with
an
air
of
being
quite
at
home
coloquinte
was
there
with
the
stamped
paper
still
on
his
head
and
old
giroudeau
told
him
again
hypocritically
enough
that
no
one
had
yet
come
in
but
the
editor
and
contributors
meet
somewhere
or
other
to
arrange
about
the
journal
said
lucien
very
likely
but
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
writing
of
the
paper
said
the
emperor
captain
resuming
his
occupation
of
checking
off
wrappers
with
his
eternal
broum
broum
was
it
lucky
or
unlucky
finot
chanced
to
come
in
at
that
very
moment
to
announce
his
sham
abdication
and
to
bid
giroudeau
watch
over
his
interests
no
with
this
gentleman
he
is
on
the
staff
finot
added
for
his
uncle
benefit
as
he
grasped
lucien
by
the
hand
oh
is
he
on
the
paper
exclaimed
giroudeau
much
surprised
at
this
friendliness
well
sir
you
came
on
without
much
difficulty
i
want
to
make
things
snug
for
you
here
lest
etienne
should
bamboozle
you
continued
finot
looking
knowingly
at
lucien
this
gentleman
will
be
paid
three
francs
per
column
all
round
including
theatres
you
have
never
taken
any
one
on
such
terms
before
said
giroudeau
opening
his
eyes
and
he
will
take
the
four
boulevard
theatres
see
that
nobody
sneaks
his
boxes
and
that
he
gets
his
share
of
i
should
advise
you
nevertheless
to
have
them
sent
to
your
address
he
added
turning
to
and
he
agrees
to
write
besides
ten
miscellaneous
articles
of
two
columns
each
for
fifty
francs
per
month
for
one
year
does
that
suit
you
yes
said
lucien
circumstances
had
forced
his
hand
draw
up
the
agreement
uncle
and
we
will
sign
it
when
we
come
downstairs
who
is
the
gentleman
inquired
giroudeau
rising
and
taking
off
his
black
silk
lucien
de
rubempre
who
wrote
the
article
on
young
man
you
have
a
gold
mine
said
the
old
soldier
tapping
lucien
on
the
forehead
i
am
not
literary
myself
but
i
read
that
article
of
yours
and
i
liked
it
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
gaiety
for
you
will
bring
us
new
subscribers
says
i
to
myself
and
so
it
did
we
sold
fifty
more
numbers
is
my
agreement
with
lousteau
made
out
in
duplicate
and
ready
to
sign
asked
finot
speaking
aside
yes
then
this
gentleman
agreement
by
one
day
so
that
lousteau
will
be
bound
by
the
previous
contract
finot
took
his
new
contributor
arm
with
a
friendliness
that
charmed
lucien
and
drew
him
out
on
the
landing
to
say
your
position
is
made
for
you
i
will
introduce
you
to
staff
myself
and
lousteau
will
go
round
with
you
to
the
theatres
you
can
make
a
hundred
and
fifty
francs
per
month
on
this
little
paper
of
ours
with
lousteau
as
its
editor
so
try
to
keep
well
with
him
the
rogue
bears
a
grudge
against
me
as
it
is
for
tying
his
hands
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
but
you
have
ability
and
i
do
choose
that
you
shall
be
subjected
to
the
whims
of
the
editor
you
might
let
me
have
a
couple
of
sheets
every
month
for
my
review
and
i
will
pay
you
two
hundred
francs
this
is
between
ourselves
do
mention
it
to
anybody
else
i
should
be
laid
open
to
the
spite
of
every
one
whose
vanity
is
mortified
by
your
good
fortune
write
four
articles
fill
your
two
sheets
sign
two
with
your
own
name
and
two
with
a
pseudonym
so
that
you
may
not
seem
to
be
taking
the
bread
out
of
anybody
else
mouth
you
owe
your
position
to
blondet
and
vignon
they
think
that
you
have
a
future
before
you
so
keep
out
of
scrapes
and
above
all
things
be
on
your
guard
against
your
friends
as
for
me
we
shall
always
get
on
well
together
you
and
i
help
me
and
i
will
help
you
you
have
forty
francs
worth
of
boxes
and
tickets
to
sell
and
sixty
francs
worth
of
books
to
convert
into
cash
with
that
and
your
work
on
the
paper
you
will
be
making
four
hundred
and
fifty
francs
every
month
if
you
use
your
wits
you
will
find
ways
of
making
another
two
hundred
francs
at
least
among
the
publishers
they
will
pay
you
for
reviews
and
prospectuses
but
you
are
mine
are
you
not
i
can
count
upon
you
lucien
squeezed
finot
hand
in
transports
of
joy
which
no
words
can
express
do
let
any
one
see
that
anything
has
passed
between
us
said
finot
in
his
ear
and
he
flung
open
a
door
of
a
room
in
the
roof
at
the
end
of
a
long
passage
on
the
fifth
floor
a
table
covered
with
a
green
cloth
was
drawn
up
to
a
blazing
fire
and
seated
in
various
chairs
and
lounges
lucien
discovered
lousteau
felicien
vernou
hector
merlin
and
two
others
unknown
to
him
all
laughing
or
smoking
a
real
inkstand
full
of
ink
this
time
stood
on
the
table
among
a
great
litter
of
papers
while
a
collection
of
pens
the
worse
for
wear
but
still
serviceable
for
journalists
told
the
new
contributor
very
plainly
that
the
mighty
enterprise
was
carried
on
in
this
apartment
gentlemen
said
finot
the
object
of
this
gathering
is
the
installation
of
our
friend
lousteau
in
my
place
as
editor
of
the
newspaper
which
i
am
compelled
to
relinquish
but
although
my
opinions
will
necessarily
undergo
a
transformation
when
i
accept
the
editorship
of
a
review
of
which
the
politics
are
known
to
you
my
remain
the
same
and
we
shall
be
friends
as
before
i
am
quite
at
your
service
and
you
likewise
will
be
ready
to
do
anything
for
me
circumstances
change
principles
are
fixed
principles
are
the
pivot
on
which
the
hands
of
the
political
barometer
turn
there
was
an
instant
shout
of
laughter
who
put
that
into
your
mouth
asked
lousteau
blondet
said
finot
windy
showery
stormy
settled
fair
said
merlin
we
will
all
row
in
the
same
boat
in
short
continued
finot
not
to
muddle
our
wits
with
metaphors
any
one
who
has
an
article
or
two
for
me
will
always
find
this
gentleman
turning
to
lucien
will
be
one
of
i
have
arranged
with
him
lousteau
every
one
congratulated
finot
on
his
advance
and
new
prospects
so
there
you
are
mounted
on
our
shoulders
said
a
contributor
whom
lucien
did
not
know
you
will
be
the
janus
of
journal
so
long
as
he
is
the
janot
put
in
vernou
are
you
going
to
allow
us
to
make
attacks
on
our
any
one
you
like
ah
yes
said
lousteau
but
the
paper
must
keep
on
its
lines
chatelet
is
very
wroth
we
shall
not
let
him
off
for
a
week
yet
what
has
happened
asked
lucien
he
came
here
to
ask
for
an
explanation
said
vernou
the
imperial
buck
found
old
giroudeau
at
home
and
old
giroudeau
told
him
with
all
the
coolness
in
the
world
that
philippe
bridau
wrote
the
article
philippe
asked
the
baron
to
mention
the
time
and
the
weapons
and
there
it
ended
we
are
engaged
at
this
moment
in
offering
excuses
to
the
baron
in
issue
every
phrase
is
a
stab
for
him
keep
your
teeth
in
him
and
he
will
come
round
to
me
said
finot
and
it
will
look
as
if
i
were
obliging
him
by
appeasing
you
he
can
say
a
word
to
the
ministry
and
we
can
get
something
or
other
out
of
him
an
assistant
schoolmaster
place
or
a
tobacconist
license
it
is
a
lucky
thing
for
us
that
we
flicked
him
on
the
raw
does
anybody
here
care
to
take
a
serious
article
on
nathan
for
my
new
paper
give
it
to
lucien
said
lousteau
hector
and
vernou
will
write
articles
in
their
papers
at
the
same
time
gentlemen
we
shall
meet
each
other
face
to
face
at
barbin
said
finot
laughing
lucien
received
some
congratulations
on
his
admission
to
the
mighty
army
of
journalists
and
lousteau
explained
that
they
could
be
sure
of
him
lucien
wants
you
all
to
sup
in
a
body
at
the
house
of
the
fair
coralie
coralie
is
going
on
at
the
gymnase
said
lucien
very
well
gentlemen
it
is
understood
that
we
push
coralie
eh
put
a
few
lines
about
her
new
engagement
in
your
papers
and
say
something
about
her
talent
credit
the
management
of
the
gymnase
with
tack
and
discernment
will
it
do
to
say
intelligence
yes
say
intelligence
said
merlin
frederic
has
something
of
scribe
oh
well
then
the
manager
of
the
gymnase
is
the
most
perspicacious
and
of
men
of
business
said
vernou
look
here
do
write
your
articles
on
nathan
until
we
have
come
to
an
understanding
you
shall
hear
why
said
etienne
lousteau
we
ought
to
do
something
for
our
new
comrade
lucien
here
has
two
books
to
bring
out
a
volume
of
sonnets
and
a
novel
the
power
of
the
paragraph
should
make
him
a
great
poet
due
in
three
months
and
we
will
make
use
of
his
sonnets
is
the
title
to
run
down
odes
ballads
and
reveries
and
all
the
romantic
poetry
it
would
be
a
droll
thing
if
the
sonnets
were
no
good
after
all
said
what
do
you
yourself
think
of
your
sonnets
lucien
yes
what
do
you
think
of
them
asked
one
of
the
two
whom
lucien
did
not
know
they
are
all
right
gentlemen
i
give
you
my
word
said
lousteau
very
well
that
will
do
for
me
said
vernou
i
will
heave
your
book
at
the
poets
of
the
sacristy
i
am
tired
of
them
if
dauriat
declines
to
take
the
this
evening
we
will
attack
him
by
pitching
into
nathan
but
what
will
nathan
say
cried
lucien
his
five
colleagues
burst
out
laughing
oh
he
will
be
delighted
said
vernou
you
will
see
how
we
manage
these
things
so
he
is
one
of
us
said
one
of
the
two
journalists
yes
yes
frederic
no
we
are
all
working
for
you
lucien
you
see
you
must
stand
by
us
when
your
turn
comes
we
are
all
friends
of
nathan
and
we
are
attacking
him
now
let
us
divide
frederic
will
you
take
the
francais
and
the
odeon
if
these
gentlemen
are
willing
returned
the
person
addressed
as
frederic
the
others
nodded
assent
but
lucien
saw
a
gleam
of
jealousy
here
and
there
i
am
keeping
the
opera
the
italiens
and
the
put
in
vernou
and
how
about
me
am
i
to
have
no
theatres
at
all
asked
the
second
stranger
oh
well
hector
can
let
you
have
the
varietes
and
lucien
can
spare
you
the
porte
let
him
have
the
porte
lucien
he
is
wild
about
fanny
beaupre
and
you
can
take
the
in
exchange
i
shall
have
bobino
and
the
funambules
and
madame
saqui
now
what
have
we
for
nothing
nothing
nothing
gentlemen
be
brilliant
for
my
first
number
the
baron
du
chatelet
and
his
cuttlefish
bone
will
not
last
for
a
week
and
the
writer
of
is
worn
out
and
is
stale
too
said
vernou
everybody
has
taken
it
up
the
fact
is
we
want
a
new
set
of
ninepins
said
frederic
suppose
that
we
take
the
virtuous
representatives
of
the
right
suggested
lousteau
we
might
say
that
de
bonald
has
sweaty
feet
let
us
begin
a
series
of
sketches
of
ministerialist
orators
suggested
hector
merlin
you
do
that
youngster
you
know
them
they
are
your
own
party
said
lousteau
you
could
indulge
any
little
private
grudges
of
your
own
pitch
into
beugnot
and
syrieys
de
mayrinhac
and
the
rest
you
might
have
the
sketches
ready
in
advance
and
we
shall
have
something
to
fall
back
upon
how
if
we
invented
one
or
two
cases
of
refusal
of
burial
with
aggravating
circumstances
asked
hector
do
not
follow
in
the
tracks
of
the
big
constitutional
papers
they
have
full
of
ecclesiastical
retorted
vernou
repeated
lucien
that
is
our
word
for
a
scrap
of
fiction
told
for
true
put
in
to
enliven
the
column
of
morning
news
when
it
is
flat
we
owe
the
discovery
to
benjamin
franklin
the
inventor
of
the
lightning
conductor
and
the
republic
that
journalist
completely
deceived
the
encyclopaedists
by
his
transatlantic
raynal
gives
two
of
them
for
facts
in
his
philosophique
des
i
did
not
know
that
said
vernou
what
were
the
stories
one
was
a
tale
about
an
englishman
and
a
negress
who
helped
him
to
escape
he
sold
the
woman
for
a
slave
after
getting
her
with
child
himself
to
enhance
her
value
the
other
was
the
eloquent
defence
of
a
young
woman
brought
before
the
authorities
for
bearing
a
child
out
of
wedlock
franklin
owned
to
the
fraud
in
necker
house
when
he
came
to
paris
much
to
the
confusion
of
french
philosophism
behold
how
the
new
world
twice
set
a
bad
example
to
the
old
in
journalism
said
lousteau
everything
that
is
probable
is
true
that
is
an
axiom
criminal
procedure
is
based
on
the
same
rule
said
vernou
very
well
we
meet
here
at
nine
and
with
that
they
rose
and
the
sitting
broke
up
with
the
most
affecting
demonstrations
of
intimacy
and
what
have
you
done
to
finot
lucien
that
he
should
make
a
special
arrangement
with
you
you
are
the
only
one
that
he
has
bound
to
himself
said
etienne
lousteau
as
they
came
downstairs
i
nothing
it
was
his
own
proposal
said
lucien
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
you
should
make
your
own
terms
with
him
i
should
be
delighted
we
should
both
of
us
be
the
better
for
it
on
the
ground
floor
they
found
finot
he
stepped
across
to
lousteau
and
asked
him
into
the
private
office
giroudeau
immediately
put
a
couple
of
stamped
agreements
before
lucien
sign
your
agreement
he
said
and
the
new
editor
will
think
the
whole
thing
was
arranged
yesterday
lucien
reading
the
document
overheard
fragments
of
a
tolerably
warm
dispute
within
as
to
the
line
of
conduct
and
profits
of
the
paper
etienne
lousteau
wanted
his
share
of
the
blackmail
levied
by
giroudeau
and
in
all
probability
the
matter
was
compromised
for
the
pair
came
out
perfectly
good
friends
we
will
meet
at
dauriat
lucien
in
the
wooden
galleries
at
eight
said
etienne
lousteau
a
young
man
appeared
meanwhile
in
search
of
employment
wearing
the
same
nervous
shy
look
with
which
lucien
himself
had
come
to
the
office
so
short
a
while
ago
and
in
his
secret
soul
lucien
felt
amused
as
he
watched
giroudeau
playing
off
the
same
tactics
with
which
the
old
campaigner
had
previously
foiled
him
opened
his
eyes
to
the
necessity
of
the
manoeuvres
which
raised
insurmountable
barriers
between
beginners
and
the
upper
room
where
the
elect
were
gathered
together
contributors
do
get
very
much
as
it
is
he
said
addressing
giroudeau
if
there
were
more
of
you
there
would
be
so
much
less
retorted
the
captain
so
there
the
old
campaigner
swung
his
loaded
cane
and
went
down
coughing
as
usual
out
in
the
street
he
was
amazed
to
see
a
handsome
carriage
waiting
on
the
boulevard
for
lucien
are
the
army
nowadays
he
said
and
we
are
the
civilians
upon
my
word
said
lucien
as
he
drove
away
with
coralie
these
young
writers
seem
to
me
to
be
the
best
fellows
alive
here
am
i
a
journalist
sure
of
making
six
hundred
francs
a
month
if
i
work
like
a
horse
but
i
shall
find
a
publisher
for
my
two
books
and
i
will
write
others
for
my
friends
will
insure
a
success
and
so
coralie
le
as
you
say
you
will
make
your
way
dear
boy
but
you
must
not
be
as
as
you
are
it
would
be
the
ruin
of
you
be
that
is
the
proper
thing
coralie
and
lucien
drove
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
and
again
they
met
the
marquise
mme
de
bargeton
and
the
baron
du
chatelet
mme
de
bargeton
gave
lucien
a
languishing
glance
which
might
be
taken
as
a
greeting
camusot
had
ordered
the
best
possible
dinner
and
coralie
feeling
that
she
was
rid
of
her
adorer
was
more
charming
to
the
poor
than
she
had
ever
been
in
the
fourteen
months
during
which
their
connection
lasted
he
had
never
seen
her
so
kindly
so
enchantingly
lovely
come
he
thought
let
us
keep
near
her
anyhow
in
consequence
camusot
made
secret
overtures
he
promised
coralie
an
income
of
six
thousand
livres
he
would
transfer
the
stock
in
the
funds
into
her
name
his
wife
knew
nothing
about
the
investment
if
only
she
would
consent
to
be
his
mistress
still
he
would
shut
his
eyes
to
her
lover
and
betray
such
an
angel
why
just
look
at
him
you
old
fossil
and
look
at
yourself
and
her
eyes
turned
to
her
poet
camusot
had
pressed
lucien
to
drink
till
the
poet
head
was
rather
cloudy
there
was
no
help
for
it
camusot
made
up
his
mind
to
wait
till
sheer
want
should
give
him
this
woman
a
second
time
then
i
can
only
be
your
friend
he
said
as
he
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
lucien
went
from
coralie
and
camusot
to
the
wooden
galleries
what
a
change
had
been
wrought
in
his
mind
by
his
initiation
into
journalism
he
mixed
fearlessly
now
with
the
crowd
which
surged
to
and
fro
in
the
buildings
he
even
swaggered
a
little
because
he
had
a
mistress
and
he
walked
into
dauriat
shop
in
an
offhand
manner
because
he
was
a
journalist
he
found
himself
among
distinguished
men
gave
a
hand
to
blondet
and
nathan
and
finot
and
to
all
the
coterie
with
whom
he
had
been
fraternizing
for
a
week
he
was
a
personage
he
thought
and
he
flattered
himself
that
he
surpassed
his
comrades
that
little
flick
of
the
wine
did
him
admirable
service
he
was
witty
he
showed
that
he
could
howl
with
the
wolves
and
yet
the
tacit
approval
the
praises
spoken
and
unspoken
on
which
he
had
counted
were
not
forthcoming
he
noticed
the
first
stirrings
of
jealousy
among
a
group
less
curious
perhaps
than
anxious
to
know
the
place
which
this
newcomer
might
take
and
the
exact
portion
of
the
of
profits
which
he
would
probably
secure
and
swallow
lucien
only
saw
smiles
on
two
faces
finot
who
regarded
him
as
a
mine
to
be
exploited
and
lousteau
who
considered
that
he
had
proprietary
rights
in
the
poet
looked
glad
to
see
him
lousteau
had
begun
already
to
assume
the
airs
of
an
editor
he
tapped
sharply
on
the
of
dauriat
private
office
one
moment
my
friend
cried
a
voice
within
as
the
publisher
face
appeared
above
the
green
curtains
the
moment
lasted
an
hour
and
finally
lucien
and
etienne
were
admitted
into
the
sanctum
well
have
you
thought
over
our
friend
proposal
asked
etienne
lousteau
now
an
editor
to
be
sure
said
dauriat
lolling
like
a
sultan
in
his
chair
i
have
read
the
volume
and
i
submitted
it
to
a
man
of
taste
a
good
judge
for
i
do
pretend
to
understand
these
things
myself
i
myself
my
friend
buy
reputations
as
the
englishman
bought
his
love
you
are
as
great
as
a
poet
as
you
are
handsome
as
a
man
my
boy
pronounced
dauriat
upon
my
word
and
honor
i
do
tell
you
that
as
a
publisher
mind
your
sonnets
are
magnificent
no
sign
of
effort
about
them
as
is
natural
when
a
man
writes
with
inspiration
and
verve
you
know
your
craft
in
fact
one
of
the
good
points
of
the
new
school
your
volume
of
is
a
fine
book
but
there
is
no
business
in
it
and
it
is
not
worth
my
while
to
meddle
with
anything
but
a
very
big
affair
in
conscience
i
wo
take
your
sonnets
it
would
be
impossible
to
push
them
there
is
not
enough
in
the
thing
to
pay
the
expenses
of
a
big
success
you
will
not
keep
to
poetry
besides
this
book
of
yours
will
be
your
first
and
last
attempt
of
the
kind
you
are
young
you
bring
me
the
everlasting
volume
of
early
verse
which
every
man
of
letters
writes
when
he
leaves
school
he
thinks
a
lot
of
it
at
the
time
and
laughs
at
it
later
on
lousteau
your
friend
has
a
poem
put
away
somewhere
among
his
old
socks
i
warrant
have
you
a
poem
that
you
thought
a
good
deal
of
once
lousteau
inquired
dauriat
with
a
knowing
glance
at
the
other
how
should
i
be
writing
prose
otherwise
eh
asked
lousteau
there
you
see
he
has
never
said
a
word
to
me
about
it
for
our
friend
understands
business
and
the
trade
continued
dauriat
for
me
the
question
is
not
whether
you
are
a
great
poet
i
know
that
he
added
stroking
down
lucien
pride
you
have
a
great
deal
a
very
great
deal
of
merit
if
i
were
only
just
starting
in
business
i
should
make
the
mistake
of
publishing
your
book
but
in
the
first
place
my
sleeping
partners
and
those
at
the
back
of
me
are
cutting
off
my
supplies
i
dropped
twenty
thousand
francs
over
poetry
last
year
and
that
is
enough
for
them
they
will
not
hear
of
any
more
just
now
and
they
are
my
masters
nevertheless
that
is
not
the
question
i
admit
that
you
may
be
a
great
poet
but
will
you
be
a
prolific
writer
will
you
hatch
sonnets
regularly
will
you
run
into
ten
volumes
is
there
business
in
it
of
course
not
you
will
be
a
delightful
prose
writer
you
have
too
much
sense
to
spoil
your
style
with
tagging
rhymes
together
you
have
a
chance
to
make
thirty
thousand
francs
per
annum
by
writing
for
the
papers
and
you
will
not
exchange
that
chance
for
three
thousand
francs
made
with
difficulty
by
your
hemistiches
and
strophes
and
tomfoolery
you
know
that
he
is
on
the
paper
dauriat
put
in
lousteau
yes
dauriat
answered
yes
i
saw
his
article
and
in
his
own
interests
i
decline
the
yes
sir
in
six
months
time
i
shall
have
paid
you
more
money
for
the
articles
that
i
shall
ask
you
to
write
than
for
your
poetry
that
will
not
sell
and
fame
said
lucien
dauriat
and
lousteau
laughed
oh
dear
said
lousteau
there
be
illusions
left
fame
means
ten
years
of
sticking
to
work
and
a
hundred
thousand
francs
lost
or
made
in
the
publishing
trade
if
you
find
anybody
mad
enough
to
print
your
poetry
for
you
you
will
feel
some
respect
for
me
in
another
twelvemonth
when
you
have
had
time
to
see
the
outcome
of
the
transaction
have
you
the
manuscript
here
lucien
asked
coldly
here
it
is
my
friend
said
dauriat
the
publisher
manner
towards
lucien
had
sweetened
singularly
lucien
took
up
the
roll
without
looking
at
the
string
so
sure
he
felt
that
dauriat
had
read
his
he
went
out
with
lousteau
seemingly
neither
disconcerted
nor
dissatisfied
dauriat
went
with
them
into
the
shop
talking
of
his
newspaper
and
lousteau
daily
while
lucien
played
with
the
manuscript
of
the
do
you
suppose
that
dauriat
has
read
your
sonnets
or
sent
them
to
any
one
else
etienne
lousteau
snatched
an
opportunity
to
whisper
yes
said
lucien
look
at
the
string
lucien
looked
down
at
the
blot
of
ink
and
saw
that
the
mark
on
the
string
still
coincided
he
turned
white
with
rage
which
of
the
sonnets
was
it
that
you
particularly
liked
he
asked
turning
to
the
publisher
they
are
all
of
them
remarkable
my
friend
but
the
sonnet
on
the
is
delightful
the
closing
thought
is
fine
and
exquisitely
expressed
i
felt
sure
from
that
sonnet
that
your
prose
work
would
command
a
success
and
i
spoke
to
finot
about
you
at
once
write
articles
for
us
and
we
will
pay
you
well
for
them
fame
is
a
very
fine
thing
you
see
but
do
forget
the
practical
and
solid
and
take
every
chance
that
turns
up
when
you
have
made
money
you
can
write
poetry
the
poet
dashed
out
of
the
shop
to
avoid
an
explosion
he
was
furious
lousteau
followed
well
my
boy
pray
keep
cool
take
men
as
they
are
for
means
to
an
end
do
you
wish
for
revenge
at
any
price
muttered
the
poet
here
is
a
copy
of
nathan
book
dauriat
has
just
given
it
to
me
the
second
edition
is
coming
out
read
the
book
again
and
knock
off
an
article
demolishing
it
felicien
vernou
can
not
endure
nathan
for
he
thinks
that
nathan
success
will
injure
his
own
forthcoming
book
it
is
a
craze
with
these
little
minds
to
fancy
that
there
is
not
room
for
two
successes
under
the
sun
so
he
will
see
that
your
article
finds
a
place
in
the
big
paper
for
which
he
writes
but
what
is
there
to
be
said
against
the
book
it
is
good
work
cried
lucien
oh
i
say
you
must
learn
your
trade
said
lousteau
laughing
given
that
the
book
was
a
masterpiece
under
the
stroke
of
your
pen
it
must
turn
to
dull
trash
dangerous
and
unwholesome
stuff
but
how
you
turn
all
the
good
points
into
bad
ones
i
am
incapable
of
such
a
juggler
feat
my
dear
boy
a
journalist
is
a
juggler
a
man
must
make
up
his
mind
to
the
drawbacks
of
the
calling
look
here
i
am
not
a
bad
fellow
this
is
the
way
should
set
to
work
myself
attention
you
might
begin
by
praising
the
book
and
amuse
yourself
a
while
by
saying
what
you
really
think
says
the
reader
critic
is
not
jealous
he
will
be
impartial
no
doubt
and
from
that
point
your
public
will
think
that
your
criticism
is
a
piece
of
conscientious
work
then
when
you
have
won
your
reader
confidence
you
will
regret
that
you
must
blame
the
tendency
and
influence
of
such
work
upon
french
literature
not
france
you
will
say
the
whole
intellectual
world
french
writers
have
kept
europe
in
the
path
of
analysis
and
philosophical
criticism
from
age
to
age
by
their
powerful
style
and
the
original
turn
given
by
them
to
ideas
here
for
the
benefit
of
the
philistine
insert
a
panegyric
on
voltaire
rousseau
diderot
montesquieu
and
buffon
hold
forth
upon
the
inexorable
french
language
show
how
it
spreads
a
varnish
as
it
were
over
thought
let
fall
a
few
aphorisms
such
as
great
writer
in
france
is
invariably
a
great
man
he
writes
in
a
language
which
compels
him
to
think
it
is
otherwise
in
other
countries
and
so
on
and
so
on
then
to
prove
your
case
draw
a
comparison
between
rabener
the
german
satirical
moralist
and
la
bruyere
nothing
gives
a
critic
such
an
air
as
an
apparent
familiarity
with
foreign
literature
kant
is
cousin
pedestal
once
on
that
ground
you
bring
out
a
word
which
sums
up
the
french
men
of
genius
of
the
eighteenth
century
for
the
benefit
of
simpletons
you
call
that
literature
the
of
ideas
armed
with
this
expression
you
fling
all
the
mighty
dead
at
the
heads
of
the
illustrious
living
you
explain
that
in
the
present
day
a
new
form
of
literature
has
sprung
up
that
dialogue
the
easiest
form
of
writing
is
overdone
and
description
dispenses
with
any
need
for
thinking
on
the
part
of
the
author
or
reader
you
bring
up
the
fiction
of
voltaire
diderot
sterne
and
le
sage
so
trenchant
so
compact
of
the
stuff
of
life
and
turn
from
them
to
the
modern
novel
composed
of
scenery
and
and
metaphor
and
the
dramatic
situations
of
which
scott
is
full
invention
may
be
displayed
in
such
work
but
there
is
no
room
for
anything
else
romance
after
the
manner
of
scott
is
a
mere
passing
fashion
in
literature
you
will
say
and
fulminate
against
the
fatal
way
in
which
ideas
are
diluted
and
beaten
thin
cry
out
against
a
style
within
the
reach
of
any
intellect
for
any
one
can
commence
author
at
small
expense
in
a
way
of
literature
which
you
can
nickname
the
of
imagery
then
you
fall
upon
nathan
with
your
argument
and
establish
it
beyound
cavil
that
he
is
a
mere
imitator
with
an
appearance
of
genius
the
concise
grand
style
of
the
eighteenth
century
is
lacking
you
show
that
the
author
substitutes
events
for
sentiments
action
and
stir
is
not
life
he
gives
you
pictures
but
no
ideas
come
out
with
such
phrases
and
people
will
take
them
in
spite
of
the
merits
of
the
work
it
seems
to
you
to
be
a
dangerous
nay
a
fatal
precedent
it
throws
open
the
gates
of
the
temple
of
fame
to
the
crowd
and
in
the
distance
you
descry
a
legion
of
petty
authors
hastening
to
imitate
this
novel
and
easy
style
of
writing
here
you
launch
out
into
resounding
lamentations
over
the
decadence
and
decline
of
taste
and
slip
in
eulogies
of
messieurs
etienne
jouy
tissot
gosse
duval
jay
benjamin
constant
aignan
villemain
and
the
whole
chorus
who
patronize
vernou
paper
next
you
draw
a
picture
of
that
glorious
phalanx
of
writers
repelling
the
invasion
of
the
romantics
these
are
the
upholders
of
ideas
and
style
as
against
metaphor
and
balderdash
the
modern
representatives
of
the
school
of
voltaire
as
opposed
to
the
english
and
german
schools
even
as
the
seventeen
heroic
deputies
of
the
left
fought
the
battle
for
the
nation
against
the
ultras
of
the
right
and
then
under
cover
of
names
respected
by
the
immense
majority
of
frenchmen
who
will
always
be
against
the
government
you
can
crush
nathan
for
although
his
work
is
far
above
the
average
it
confirms
the
bourgeois
taste
for
literature
without
ideas
and
after
that
you
understand
it
is
no
longer
a
question
of
nathan
and
his
book
but
of
france
and
the
glory
of
france
it
is
the
duty
of
all
honest
and
courageous
pens
to
make
strenuous
opposition
to
these
foreign
importations
and
with
that
you
flatter
your
readers
shrewd
french
is
not
easily
caught
napping
if
publishers
by
ways
which
you
do
not
choose
to
specify
have
stolen
a
success
the
reading
public
very
soon
judges
for
itself
and
corrects
the
mistakes
made
by
some
five
hundred
fools
who
always
rush
to
the
fore
say
that
the
publisher
who
sold
a
first
edition
of
the
book
is
audacious
indeed
to
issue
a
second
and
express
regret
that
so
clever
a
man
does
not
know
the
taste
of
the
country
better
there
is
the
gist
of
it
just
a
sprinkle
of
the
salt
of
wit
and
a
dash
of
vinegar
to
bring
out
the
flavor
and
dauriat
will
be
done
to
a
turn
but
mind
that
you
end
with
seeming
to
pity
nathan
for
a
mistake
and
speak
of
him
as
of
a
man
from
whom
contemporary
literature
may
look
for
great
things
if
he
renounces
these
ways
lucien
was
amazed
at
this
talk
from
lousteau
as
the
journalist
spoke
the
scales
fell
from
his
eyes
he
beheld
new
truths
of
which
he
had
never
before
caught
so
much
as
a
glimpse
but
all
this
that
you
are
saying
is
quite
true
and
just
said
he
if
it
were
not
how
could
you
make
it
tell
against
nathan
book
asked
lousteau
that
is
the
first
manner
of
demolishing
a
book
my
boy
it
is
the
pickaxe
style
of
criticism
but
there
are
plenty
of
other
ways
your
education
will
complete
itself
in
time
when
you
are
absolutely
obliged
to
speak
of
a
man
whom
you
do
not
like
for
proprietors
and
editors
are
sometimes
under
compulsion
you
bring
out
a
neutral
special
article
you
put
the
title
of
the
book
at
the
head
of
it
and
begin
with
general
remarks
on
the
greeks
and
the
romans
if
you
like
and
wind
up
with
this
brings
us
to
book
which
will
form
the
subject
of
a
second
article
the
second
article
never
appears
and
in
this
way
you
snuff
out
the
book
between
two
promises
but
in
this
case
you
are
writing
down
not
nathan
but
dauriat
he
needs
the
pickaxe
style
if
the
book
is
really
good
the
pickaxe
does
no
harm
but
it
goes
to
the
core
of
it
if
it
is
bad
in
the
first
case
no
one
but
the
publisher
is
any
the
worse
in
the
second
you
do
the
public
a
service
both
methods
moreover
are
equally
serviceable
in
political
criticism
etienne
lousteau
cruel
lesson
opened
up
possibilities
for
imagination
he
understood
this
craft
to
admiration
let
us
go
to
the
office
said
lousteau
we
shall
find
our
friends
there
and
we
will
agree
among
ourselves
to
charge
at
nathan
they
will
laugh
you
will
see
arrived
in
the
rue
they
went
up
to
the
room
in
the
roof
where
the
paper
was
made
up
and
lucien
was
surprised
and
gratified
no
less
to
see
the
alacrity
with
which
his
comrades
proceeded
to
demolish
nathan
book
hector
merlin
took
up
a
piece
of
paper
and
wrote
a
few
lines
for
his
own
a
second
edition
of
nathan
book
is
announced
we
had
intended
to
keep
silence
with
regard
to
that
work
but
its
apparent
success
obliges
us
to
publish
an
article
not
so
much
upon
the
book
itself
as
upon
certain
tendencies
of
the
new
school
of
literature
at
the
head
of
the
facetiae
in
the
morning
paper
lousteau
inserted
the
following
note
dauriat
is
bringing
out
a
second
edition
of
nathan
book
evidently
he
does
not
know
the
legal
maxim
bis
in
all
honor
to
rash
courage
lousteau
words
had
been
like
a
torch
for
burning
lucien
hot
desire
to
be
revenged
on
dauriat
took
the
place
of
conscience
and
inspiration
for
three
days
he
never
left
coralie
room
he
sat
at
work
by
the
fire
waited
upon
by
berenice
petted
in
moments
of
weariness
by
the
silent
and
attentive
coralie
till
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
had
made
a
fair
copy
of
about
three
columns
of
criticism
and
an
astonishingly
good
piece
of
work
it
was
nine
in
the
evening
when
he
ran
round
to
the
office
found
his
associates
and
read
over
his
work
to
an
attentive
audience
felicien
said
not
a
syllable
he
took
up
the
manuscript
and
made
off
with
it
down
the
staircase
what
has
come
to
him
cried
lucien
he
has
taken
your
article
straight
to
the
printer
said
hector
merlin
is
a
masterpiece
not
a
line
to
add
nor
a
word
to
take
out
there
was
no
need
to
do
more
than
show
you
the
way
said
lousteau
i
should
like
to
see
nathan
face
when
he
reads
this
said
another
contributor
beaming
with
gentle
satisfaction
it
is
as
well
to
have
you
for
a
friend
remarked
hector
merlin
then
it
will
do
lucien
asked
quickly
blondet
and
vignon
will
feel
bad
said
lousteau
here
is
a
short
article
which
i
have
knocked
together
for
you
began
lucien
if
it
takes
i
could
write
you
a
series
read
it
over
said
lousteau
and
lucien
read
the
first
of
the
delightful
short
papers
which
made
the
fortune
of
the
little
newspaper
a
series
of
sketches
of
paris
life
a
portrait
a
type
an
ordinary
event
or
some
of
the
oddities
of
the
great
city
this
specimen
the
man
in
the
street
was
written
in
a
way
that
was
fresh
and
original
the
thoughts
were
struck
out
by
the
shock
of
the
words
the
sounding
ring
of
the
adverbs
and
adjectives
caught
the
ear
the
paper
was
as
different
from
the
serious
and
profound
article
on
nathan
as
the
from
the
des
you
are
a
born
journalist
said
lousteau
it
shall
go
in
do
as
much
of
this
sort
of
thing
as
you
like
ah
by
the
by
said
merlin
dauriat
is
furious
about
those
two
bombshells
hurled
into
his
magazine
i
have
just
come
from
him
he
was
hurling
imprecations
and
in
such
a
rage
with
finot
who
told
him
that
he
had
sold
his
paper
to
you
as
for
me
i
took
him
aside
and
just
said

word
in
his
ear

cost
you
dear
i
told
him
man
of
talent
comes
to
you
you
turn
the
cold
shoulder
on
him
and
send
him
into
the
arms
of
the
newspapers
dauriat
will
be
dumfounded
by
the
article
on
nathan
said
lousteau
do
you
see
now
what
journalism
is
lucien
your
revenge
is
beginning
to
tell
the
baron
chatelet
came
here
this
morning
for
your
address
there
was
a
cutting
article
upon
him
in
this
morning
issue
he
is
a
weakling
that
buck
of
the
empire
and
he
has
lost
his
head
have
you
seen
the
paper
it
is
a
funny
article
look
of
the
heron
and
the
lament
mme
de
bargeton
is
called
the
now
and
no
mistake
and
chatelet
is
known
everywhere
as
baron
heron
lucien
took
up
the
paper
and
could
not
help
laughing
at
extremely
clever
skit
they
will
capitulate
soon
said
hector
merlin
lucien
merrily
assisted
at
the
manufacture
of
epigrams
and
jokes
at
the
end
of
the
paper
and
the
associates
smoked
and
chatted
over
the
day
adventures
over
the
foibles
of
some
among
their
number
or
some
new
bit
of
personal
gossip
from
their
witty
malicious
bantering
talk
lucien
gained
a
knowledge
of
the
inner
life
of
literature
and
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
craft
while
they
are
setting
up
the
paper
i
will
go
round
with
you
and
introduce
you
to
the
managers
of
your
theatres
and
take
you
behind
the
scenes
said
lousteau
and
then
we
will
go
to
the
and
have
a
frolic
in
their
they
went
from
theatre
to
theatre
lucien
was
introduced
to
this
one
and
that
and
enthroned
as
a
dramatic
critic
managers
complimented
him
actresses
flung
him
side
glances
for
every
one
of
them
knew
that
this
was
the
critic
who
by
a
single
article
had
gained
an
engagement
at
the
gymnase
with
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
for
coralie
and
another
for
florine
at
the
with
eight
thousand
francs
lucien
was
a
man
of
importance
the
little
ovations
raised
lucien
in
his
own
eyes
and
taught
him
to
know
his
power
at
eleven
the
pair
arrived
at
the
lucien
with
a
careless
air
that
worked
wonders
nathan
was
there
nathan
held
out
a
hand
which
lucien
squeezed
ah
my
masters
so
you
have
a
mind
to
floor
me
have
you
said
nathan
looking
from
one
to
the
other
just
you
wait
till
my
dear
fellow
and
you
shall
see
how
lucien
has
taken
you
in
hand
upon
my
word
you
will
be
pleased
a
piece
of
serious
criticism
like
that
is
sure
to
do
a
book
good
lucien
reddened
with
confusion
is
it
severe
inquired
nathan
it
is
serious
said
lousteau
then
there
is
no
harm
done
nathan
rejoined
hector
merlin
in
the
greenroom
of
the
vaudeville
was
saying
that
i
had
been
cut
up
let
him
talk
and
wait
cried
lucien
and
took
refuge
in
coralie
in
her
alluring
costume
had
just
come
off
the
stage
next
morning
as
lucien
and
coralie
sat
at
breakfast
a
carriage
drove
along
the
rue
de
vendome
the
street
was
quiet
enough
so
that
they
could
hear
the
light
sound
made
by
an
elegant
cabriolet
and
there
was
that
in
the
pace
of
the
horse
and
the
manner
of
pulling
up
at
the
door
which
tells
unmistakably
of
a
thoroughbred
lucien
went
to
the
window
and
there
in
fact
beheld
a
splendid
english
horse
and
no
less
a
person
than
dauriat
flinging
the
reins
to
his
man
as
he
stepped
down
is
the
publisher
coralie
said
lucien
let
him
wait
berenice
coralie
said
at
once
lucien
smiled
at
her
presence
of
mind
and
kissed
her
with
a
great
rush
of
tenderness
this
mere
girl
had
made
his
interests
hers
in
a
wonderful
way
she
was
where
he
was
concerned
the
apparition
of
the
insolent
publisher
the
sudden
and
complete
collapse
of
that
prince
of
charlatans
was
due
to
circumstances
almost
entirely
forgotten
so
utterly
has
the
book
trade
changed
during
the
last
fifteen
years
from
to
when
newspaper
were
only
just
beginning
to
lend
new
books
the
fiscal
law
pressed
more
heavily
than
ever
upon
periodical
publications
and
necessity
created
the
invention
of
advertisements
paragraphs
and
articles
in
the
newspapers
were
the
only
means
of
advertisement
known
in
those
days
and
french
newspapers
before
the
year
were
so
small
that
the
largest
sheet
of
those
times
was
not
so
large
as
the
smallest
daily
paper
of
ours
dauriat
and
ladvocat
the
first
publishers
to
make
a
stand
against
the
tyranny
of
journalists
were
also
the
first
to
use
the
placards
which
caught
the
attention
of
paris
by
strange
type
striking
colors
vignettes
and
at
a
later
time
by
lithograph
illustrations
till
a
placard
became
a
for
the
eyes
and
not
unfrequently
a
snare
for
the
purse
of
the
amateur
so
much
originality
indeed
was
expended
on
placards
in
paris
that
one
of
that
peculiar
kind
of
maniacs
known
as
a
collector
possesses
a
complete
series
at
first
the
placard
was
confined
to
the
and
stalls
upon
the
boulevards
in
paris
afterwards
it
spread
all
over
france
till
it
was
supplanted
to
some
extent
by
a
return
to
advertisements
in
the
newspapers
but
the
placard
nevertheless
which
continues
to
strike
the
eye
after
the
advertisement
and
the
book
which
is
advertised
are
both
forgotten
will
always
be
among
us
it
took
a
new
lease
of
life
when
walls
were
plastered
with
posters
newspaper
advertising
the
offspring
of
heavy
stamp
duties
a
high
rate
of
postage
and
the
heavy
deposits
of
required
by
the
government
as
security
for
good
behavior
is
within
the
reach
of
all
who
care
to
pay
for
it
and
has
turned
the
fourth
page
of
every
journal
into
a
harvest
field
alike
for
the
speculator
and
the
inland
revenue
department
the
press
restrictions
were
invented
in
the
time
of
de
villele
who
had
a
chance
if
he
had
but
known
it
of
destroying
the
power
of
journalism
by
allowing
newspapers
to
multiply
till
no
one
took
any
notice
of
them
but
he
missed
his
opportunity
and
a
sort
of
privilege
was
created
as
it
were
by
the
almost
insuperable
difficulties
put
in
the
way
of
starting
a
new
venture
so
in
the
periodical
press
might
be
said
to
have
power
of
life
and
death
over
the
creations
of
the
brain
and
the
publishing
trade
a
few
lines
among
the
items
of
news
cost
a
fearful
amount
intrigues
were
multiplied
in
newspaper
offices
and
of
a
night
when
the
columns
were
divided
up
and
this
or
that
article
was
put
in
or
left
out
to
suit
the
space
the
became
a
sort
of
battlefield
so
much
so
that
the
largest
publishing
firms
had
writers
in
their
pay
to
insert
short
articles
in
which
many
ideas
are
put
in
little
space
obscure
journalists
of
this
stamp
were
only
paid
after
the
insertion
of
the
items
and
not
unfrequently
spent
the
night
in
the
to
make
sure
that
their
contributions
were
not
omitted
sometimes
putting
in
a
long
article
obtained
heaven
knows
how
sometimes
a
few
lines
of
a
puff
the
manners
and
customs
of
journalism
and
of
the
publishing
houses
have
since
changed
so
much
that
many
people
nowadays
will
not
believe
what
immense
efforts
were
made
by
writers
and
publishers
of
books
to
secure
a
newspaper
puff
the
martyrs
of
glory
and
all
those
who
are
condemned
to
the
penal
servitude
of
a
success
were
reduced
to
such
shifts
and
stooped
to
depths
of
bribery
and
corruption
as
seem
fabulous
every
kind
of
persuasion
was
brought
to
bear
on
journalists
dinners
flattery
and
presents
the
following
story
will
throw
more
light
on
the
close
connection
between
the
critic
and
the
publisher
than
any
quantity
of
flat
assertions
there
was
once
upon
a
time
an
editor
of
an
important
paper
a
clever
writer
with
a
prospect
of
becoming
a
statesman
he
was
young
in
those
days
and
fond
of
pleasure
and
he
became
the
favorite
of
a
publishing
house
one
sunday
the
wealthy
head
of
the
firm
was
entertaining
several
of
the
foremost
journalists
of
the
time
in
the
country
and
the
mistress
of
the
house
then
a
young
and
pretty
woman
went
to
walk
in
her
park
with
the
illustrious
visitor
the
of
the
firm
a
cool
steady
methodical
german
with
nothing
but
business
in
his
head
was
discussing
a
project
with
one
of
the
journalists
and
as
they
chatted
they
walked
on
into
the
woods
beyond
the
park
in
among
the
thickets
the
german
thought
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
hostess
put
up
his
eyeglass
made
a
sign
to
his
young
companion
to
be
silent
and
turned
back
stepping
what
did
you
see
asked
the
nothing
particular
said
the
clerk
our
affair
of
the
long
article
is
settled
we
shall
have
at
least
three
columns
in
the
another
anecdote
will
show
the
influence
of
a
single
article
a
book
of
de
chateaubriand
on
the
last
of
the
stuarts
was
for
some
time
a
nightingale
on
the
bookseller
shelves
a
single
article
in
the
des
sold
the
work
in
a
week
in
those
days
when
there
were
no
lending
libraries
a
publisher
would
sell
an
edition
of
ten
thousand
copies
of
a
book
by
a
liberal
if
it
was
well
reviewed
by
the
opposition
papers
but
then
the
belgian
pirated
editions
were
not
as
yet
the
preparatory
attacks
made
by
lucien
friends
followed
up
by
his
article
on
nathan
proved
efficacious
they
stopped
the
sale
of
his
book
nathan
escaped
with
the
mortification
he
had
been
paid
he
had
nothing
to
lose
but
dauriat
was
like
to
lose
thirty
thousand
francs
the
trade
in
new
books
may
in
fact
be
summed
up
much
on
this
wise
a
ream
of
blank
paper
costs
fifteen
francs
a
ream
of
printed
paper
is
worth
anything
between
a
hundred
sous
and
a
hundred
crowns
according
to
its
success
a
favorable
or
unfavorable
review
at
a
critical
time
often
decides
the
question
and
dauriat
having
five
hundred
reams
of
printed
paper
on
hand
hurried
to
make
terms
with
lucien
the
sultan
was
now
the
slave
after
waiting
for
some
time
fidgeting
and
making
as
much
noise
as
he
could
while
parleying
with
berenice
he
at
last
obtained
speech
of
lucien
and
arrogant
publisher
though
he
was
he
came
in
with
the
radiant
air
of
a
courtier
in
the
royal
presence
mingled
however
with
a
certain
and
easy
good
humor
do
disturb
yourselves
my
little
dears
how
nice
they
look
just
like
a
pair
of
who
would
think
now
mademoiselle
that
he
with
that
girl
face
of
his
could
be
a
tiger
with
claws
of
steel
ready
to
tear
a
reputation
to
rags
just
as
he
tears
your
wrappers
i
be
bound
when
you
are
not
quick
enough
to
unfasten
them
and
he
laughed
before
he
had
finished
his
jest
my
dear
boy
he
began
sitting
down
beside
lucien
mademoiselle
i
am
dauriat
he
said
interrupting
himself
he
judged
it
expedient
to
fire
his
name
at
her
like
a
pistol
shot
for
he
considered
that
coralie
was
less
cordial
than
she
should
have
been
have
you
breakfasted
monsieur
will
you
keep
us
company
asked
coralie
why
yes
it
is
easier
to
talk
at
table
said
dauriat
besides
by
accepting
your
invitation
i
shall
have
a
right
to
expect
you
to
dine
with
my
friend
lucien
here
for
we
must
be
close
friends
now
hand
and
glove
berenice
bring
oysters
lemons
fresh
butter
and
champagne
said
coralie
you
are
too
clever
not
to
know
what
has
brought
me
here
said
dauriat
fixing
his
eyes
on
lucien
you
have
come
to
buy
my
sonnets
precisely
first
of
all
let
us
lay
down
our
arms
on
both
sides
as
he
spoke
he
took
out
a
neat
pocketbook
drew
from
it
three
bills
for
a
thousand
francs
each
and
laid
them
before
lucien
with
a
suppliant
air
is
monsieur
content
asked
he
yes
said
the
poet
a
sense
of
beatitude
for
which
no
words
exist
flooded
his
soul
at
the
sight
of
that
unhoped
wealth
he
controlled
himself
but
he
longed
to
sing
aloud
to
jump
for
joy
he
was
ready
to
believe
in
aladdin
lamp
and
in
enchantment
he
believed
in
his
own
genius
in
short
then
the
are
mine
continued
dauriat
but
you
will
undertake
not
to
attack
my
publications
wo
you
the
are
yours
but
i
can
not
pledge
my
pen
it
is
at
the
service
of
my
friends
as
theirs
are
mine
but
you
are
one
of
my
authors
now
all
my
authors
are
my
friends
so
you
wo
spoil
my
business
without
warning
me
beforehand
so
that
i
am
prepared
will
you
i
agree
to
that
to
your
fame
and
dauriat
raised
his
glass
i
see
that
you
have
read
the
said
lucien
dauriat
was
not
disconcerted
my
boy
a
publisher
can
not
pay
a
greater
compliment
than
by
buying
your
unread
in
six
months
time
you
will
be
a
great
poet
you
will
be
written
up
people
are
afraid
of
you
i
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
selling
your
book
i
am
the
same
man
of
business
that
i
was
four
days
ago
it
is
not
i
who
have
changed
it
is
last
week
your
sonnets
were
so
many
cabbage
leaves
for
me
your
position
has
ranked
them
beside
delavigne
ah
well
said
lucien
if
you
have
not
read
my
sonnets
you
have
read
my
article
with
the
sultan
pleasure
of
possessing
a
fair
mistress
and
the
certainty
of
success
he
had
grown
satirical
and
adorably
impertinent
of
late
yes
my
friend
do
you
think
i
should
have
come
here
in
such
a
hurry
but
for
that
that
terrible
article
of
yours
is
very
well
written
worse
luck
oh
you
have
a
very
great
gift
my
boy
take
my
advice
and
make
the
most
of
your
vogue
he
added
with
good
humor
which
masked
the
extreme
insolence
of
the
speech
but
have
you
yourself
a
copy
of
the
paper
have
you
seen
your
article
in
print
not
yet
said
lucien
though
this
is
the
first
long
piece
of
prose
which
i
have
published
but
hector
will
have
sent
a
copy
to
my
address
in
the
rue
charlot
here
read
cried
dauriat
copying
talma
gesture
in
lucien
took
the
paper
but
coralie
snatched
it
from
him
the
of
your
pen
belong
to
me
as
you
well
know
she
laughed
dauriat
was
unwontedly
and
complimentary
he
was
afraid
of
lucien
and
therefore
he
asked
him
to
a
great
dinner
which
he
was
giving
to
a
party
of
journalists
towards
the
end
of
the
week
and
coralie
was
included
in
the
invitation
he
took
the
away
with
him
when
he
went
asking
poet
to
look
in
when
he
pleased
in
the
wooden
galleries
and
the
agreement
should
be
ready
for
his
signature
dauriat
never
forgot
the
royal
airs
with
which
he
endeavored
to
overawe
superficial
observers
and
to
impress
them
with
the
notion
that
he
was
a
maecenas
rather
than
a
publisher
at
this
moment
he
left
the
three
thousand
francs
waving
away
in
lordly
fashion
the
receipt
which
lucien
offered
kissed
coralie
hand
and
took
his
departure
well
dear
love
would
you
have
seen
many
of
these
bits
of
paper
if
you
had
stopped
in
your
hole
in
the
rue
de
cluny
prowling
about
among
the
musty
old
books
in
the
bibliotheque
de
asked
coralie
for
she
knew
the
whole
story
of
lucien
life
by
this
time
those
little
friends
of
yours
in
the
rue
des
are
great
ninnies
it
seems
to
me
his
brothers
of
the
and
lucien
could
hear
the
verdict
and
laugh
he
had
seen
himself
in
print
he
had
just
experienced
the
ineffable
joy
of
the
author
that
first
pleasurable
thrill
of
gratified
vanity
which
comes
but
once
the
full
import
and
bearing
of
his
article
became
apparent
to
him
as
he
read
and
it
the
garb
of
print
is
to
manuscript
as
the
stage
is
to
women
it
brings
beauties
and
defects
to
light
killing
and
giving
life
the
fine
thoughts
and
the
faults
alike
stare
you
in
the
face
lucien
in
his
excitement
and
rapture
gave
not
another
thought
to
nathan
nathan
was
a
for
him
that
was
all
and
he
lucien
was
happy
exceedingly
he
thought
himself
rich
the
money
brought
by
dauriat
was
a
very
potosi
for
the
lad
who
used
to
go
about
unnoticed
through
the
streets
of
angouleme
and
down
the
steep
path
into
to
postel
garret
where
his
whole
family
had
lived
upon
an
income
of
twelve
hundred
francs
the
pleasures
of
his
life
in
paris
must
inevitably
dim
the
memories
of
those
days
but
so
keen
were
they
that
as
yet
he
seemed
to
be
back
again
in
the
place
du
murier
he
thought
of
eve
his
beautiful
noble
sister
of
david
his
friend
and
of
his
poor
mother
and
he
sent
berenice
out
to
change
one
of
the
notes
while
she
went
he
wrote
a
few
lines
to
his
family
and
on
the
maid
return
he
sent
her
to
the
with
a
packet
of
five
hundred
francs
addressed
to
his
mother
he
could
not
trust
himself
he
wanted
to
sent
the
money
at
once
later
he
might
not
be
able
to
do
it
both
lucien
and
coralie
looked
upon
this
restitution
as
a
meritorious
action
coralie
put
her
arms
about
her
lover
and
kissed
him
and
thought
him
a
model
son
and
brother
she
could
not
make
enough
of
him
for
generosity
is
a
trait
of
character
which
delights
these
kindly
creatures
who
always
carry
their
hearts
in
their
hands
we
have
a
dinner
now
every
day
for
a
week
she
said
we
will
make
a
little
carnival
you
have
worked
quite
hard
enough
coralie
fain
to
delight
in
the
beauty
of
a
man
whom
all
other
women
should
envy
her
took
lucien
back
to
staub
he
was
not
dressed
finely
enough
for
her
thence
the
lovers
went
to
drive
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
and
came
back
to
dine
at
mme
du
rastignac
bixiou
des
lupeaulx
finot
blondet
vignon
the
baron
de
nucingen
beaudenord
philippe
bridau
conti
the
great
musician
all
the
artists
and
speculators
all
the
men
who
seek
for
violent
sensations
as
a
relief
from
immense
labors
gave
lucien
a
welcome
among
them
and
lucien
had
gained
confidence
he
gave
himself
out
in
talk
as
though
he
had
not
to
live
by
his
wit
and
was
pronounced
to
be
a
clever
fellow
in
the
slang
of
the
coterie
of
oh
we
must
wait
and
see
what
he
has
in
him
said
theodore
gaillard
a
poet
patronized
by
the
court
who
thought
of
starting
a
royalist
paper
to
be
entitled
the
at
a
later
day
after
dinner
merlin
and
lucien
coralie
and
mme
du
went
to
the
opera
where
merlin
had
a
box
the
whole
party
adjourned
thither
and
lucien
triumphant
reappeared
upon
the
scene
of
his
first
serious
check
he
walked
in
the
lobby
arm
in
arm
with
merlin
and
blondet
looking
the
dandies
who
had
once
made
merry
at
his
expense
between
the
eyes
chatelet
was
under
his
feet
he
clashed
glances
with
de
marsay
vandenesse
and
manerville
the
bucks
of
that
day
and
indeed
lucien
beautiful
and
elegantly
arrayed
had
caused
a
discussion
in
the
marquise
box
rastignac
had
paid
a
long
visit
and
the
marquise
and
mme
de
bargeton
put
up
their
at
coralie
did
the
sight
of
lucien
send
a
pang
of
regret
through
mme
de
bargeton
heart
this
thought
was
uppermost
in
the
poet
mind
the
longing
for
revenge
aroused
in
him
by
the
sight
of
the
corinne
of
angouleme
was
as
fierce
as
on
that
day
when
the
lady
and
her
cousin
had
cut
him
in
the
did
you
bring
an
amulet
with
you
from
the
provinces
it
was
blondet
who
made
this
inquiry
some
few
days
later
when
he
called
at
eleven
in
the
morning
and
found
that
lucien
was
not
yet
his
good
looks
are
making
ravages
from
cellar
to
garret
high
and
low
continued
blondet
kissing
coralie
on
the
forehead
i
have
come
to
enlist
you
dear
fellow
he
continued
grasping
lucien
by
the
hand
yesterday
at
the
italiens
the
comtesse
de
montcornet
asked
me
to
bring
you
to
her
house
you
will
not
give
a
refusal
to
a
charming
woman
you
meet
people
of
the
first
fashion
there
if
lucien
is
nice
he
will
not
go
to
see
your
countess
put
in
coralie
what
call
is
there
for
him
to
show
his
face
in
fine
society
he
would
only
be
bored
there
have
you
a
vested
interest
in
him
are
you
jealous
of
fine
ladies
yes
cried
coralie
they
are
worse
than
we
are
how
do
you
know
that
my
pet
asked
blondet
from
their
husbands
retorted
she
you
are
forgetting
that
i
once
had
six
months
of
de
marsay
do
you
suppose
child
that
am
particularly
anxious
to
take
such
a
handsome
fellow
as
your
poet
to
mme
de
montcornet
house
if
you
object
let
us
consider
that
nothing
has
been
said
but
i
do
fancy
that
the
women
are
so
much
in
question
as
a
poor
devil
that
lucien
pilloried
in
his
newspaper
he
is
begging
for
mercy
and
peace
the
baron
du
chatelet
is
imbecile
enough
to
take
the
thing
seriously
the
marquise
mme
de
bargeton
and
mme
de
montcornet
set
have
taken
up
the
heron
cause
and
i
have
undertaken
to
reconcile
petrarch
and
his
laura
mme
de
bargeton
and
lucien
aha
cried
lucien
the
glow
of
the
intoxication
of
revenge
throbbing
through
every
vein
aha
so
my
foot
is
on
their
necks
you
make
me
adore
my
pen
worship
my
friends
bow
down
to
the
power
of
the
press
i
have
not
written
a
single
sentence
as
yet
upon
the
heron
and
the
i
will
go
with
you
my
boy
he
cried
catching
blondet
by
the
waist
yes
i
will
go
but
first
the
couple
shall
feel
the
weight
of
for
so
light
as
it
is
he
flourished
the
pen
which
had
written
the
article
upon
nathan
he
cried
i
will
hurl
a
couple
of
columns
at
their
heads
then
we
shall
see
do
be
frightened
coralie
it
is
not
love
but
revenge
revenge
and
i
will
have
it
to
the
full
what
a
man
it
is
said
blondet
if
you
but
knew
lucien
how
rare
such
explosions
are
in
this
jaded
paris
you
might
appreciate
yourself
you
will
be
a
precious
scamp
the
actual
expression
was
a
trifle
stronger
you
are
in
a
fair
way
to
be
a
power
in
the
land
he
will
get
on
said
coralie
well
he
has
come
a
good
way
already
in
six
weeks
and
if
he
should
climb
so
high
that
he
can
reach
a
sceptre
by
treading
over
a
corpse
he
shall
have
coralie
body
for
a
said
the
girl
you
are
a
pair
of
lovers
of
the
golden
age
said
i
congratulate
you
on
your
big
article
he
added
turning
to
lucien
there
were
a
lot
of
new
things
in
it
you
are
past
master
lousteau
called
with
hector
merlin
and
vernou
lucien
was
immensely
flattered
by
this
attention
felicien
vernou
brought
a
hundred
francs
for
lucien
article
it
was
felt
that
such
a
contributor
must
be
well
paid
to
attach
him
to
the
paper
coralie
looking
round
at
the
chapter
of
journalists
ordered
in
a
breakfast
from
the
the
nearest
restaurant
and
asked
her
visitors
to
adjourn
to
her
handsomely
furnished
when
berenice
announced
that
the
meal
was
ready
in
the
middle
of
the
repast
when
the
champagne
had
gone
to
all
heads
the
motive
of
the
visit
came
out
you
do
not
mean
to
make
an
enemy
of
nathan
do
you
asked
lousteau
nathan
is
a
journalist
and
he
has
friends
he
might
play
you
an
ugly
trick
with
your
first
book
you
have
your
of
charles
to
sell
have
you
not
we
went
round
to
nathan
this
morning
he
is
in
a
terrible
way
but
you
will
set
about
another
article
and
puff
praise
in
his
face
what
after
my
article
against
his
book
would
you
have
me
say
began
lucien
the
whole
party
cut
him
short
with
a
shout
of
laughter
did
you
ask
him
to
supper
here
the
day
after
asked
blondet
you
article
was
not
signed
added
lousteau
felicien
not
being
quite
such
a
new
hand
as
you
are
was
careful
to
put
an
initial
c
at
the
bottom
you
can
do
that
now
with
all
your
articles
in
his
paper
which
is
pure
unadulterated
left
we
are
all
of
us
in
the
opposition
felicien
was
tactful
enough
not
to
compromise
your
future
opinions
hector
shop
is
right
centre
you
might
sign
your
work
on
it
with
an
if
you
cut
a
man
up
you
do
it
anonymously
if
you
praise
him
it
is
just
as
well
to
put
your
name
to
your
article
it
is
not
the
signatures
that
trouble
me
returned
lucien
but
i
can
not
see
anything
to
be
said
in
favor
of
the
book
then
did
you
really
think
as
you
wrote
asked
hector
yes
oh
i
thought
you
were
cleverer
than
that
youngster
said
blondet
no
upon
my
word
as
i
looked
at
that
forehead
of
yours
i
credited
you
with
the
omnipotence
of
the
great
mind
the
power
of
seeing
both
sides
of
everything
in
literature
my
boy
every
idea
is
reversible
and
no
man
can
take
upon
himself
to
decide
which
is
the
right
or
wrong
side
everything
is
in
the
domain
of
thought
ideas
are
binary
janus
is
a
fable
signifying
criticism
and
the
symbol
of
genius
the
almighty
alone
is
triform
what
raises
moliere
and
corneille
above
the
rest
of
us
but
the
faculty
of
saying
one
thing
with
an
alceste
or
an
octave
and
another
with
a
philinte
or
a
cinna
rousseau
wrote
a
letter
against
dueling
in
the
heloise
and
another
in
favor
of
it
which
of
the
two
represented
his
own
opinion
will
you
venture
to
take
it
upon
yourself
to
decide
which
of
us
could
give
judgement
for
clarissa
or
lovelace
hector
or
achilles
who
was
homer
hero
what
did
richardson
himself
think
it
is
the
function
of
criticism
to
look
at
a
man
work
in
all
its
aspects
we
draw
up
our
case
in
short
do
you
really
stick
to
your
written
opinions
asked
vernou
with
a
satirical
expression
why
we
are
retailers
of
phrases
that
is
how
we
make
a
livelihood
when
you
try
to
do
a
good
piece
of
work
to
write
a
book
in
short
you
can
put
your
thoughts
yourself
into
it
and
cling
to
it
and
fight
for
it
but
as
for
newspaper
articles
read
and
forgotten
they
are
worth
nothing
in
my
eyes
but
the
money
that
is
paid
for
them
if
you
attach
any
importance
to
such
drivel
you
might
as
well
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
invoke
heaven
when
you
sit
down
to
write
a
tradesman
circular
every
one
apparently
was
astonished
at
lucien
scruples
the
last
rags
of
the
boyish
conscience
were
torn
away
and
he
was
invested
with
the
of
journalism
do
you
know
what
nathan
said
by
way
of
comforting
himself
after
your
criticism
asked
lousteau
how
should
i
know
nathan
exclaimed
pass
away
but
a
great
work
lives
he
will
be
here
to
supper
in
two
days
and
he
will
be
sure
to
fall
flat
at
your
feet
and
kiss
your
claws
and
swear
that
you
are
a
great
man
that
would
be
a
funny
thing
was
lucien
comment
repeated
blondet
he
ca
help
himself
i
am
quite
willing
my
friends
said
lucien
on
whom
the
wine
had
begun
to
take
effect
but
what
am
i
to
say
oh
well
refute
yourself
in
three
good
columns
in
merlin
paper
we
have
been
enjoying
the
sight
of
nathan
wrath
we
have
just
been
telling
him
that
he
owes
us
no
little
gratitude
for
getting
up
a
hot
controversy
that
will
sell
his
second
edition
in
a
week
in
his
eyes
at
this
present
moment
you
are
a
spy
a
scoundrel
a
caitiff
wretch
the
day
after
you
will
be
a
genius
an
uncommonly
clever
fellow
one
of
plutarch
men
nathan
will
hug
you
and
call
you
his
best
friend
dauriat
has
been
to
see
you
you
have
your
three
thousand
francs
you
have
worked
the
trick
now
you
want
nathan
respect
and
esteem
nobody
ought
to
be
let
in
except
the
publisher
we
must
not
immolate
any
one
but
an
enemy
we
should
not
talk
like
this
if
it
were
a
question
of
some
outsider
some
inconvenient
person
who
had
made
a
name
for
himself
without
us
and
was
not
wanted
but
nathan
is
one
of
us
blondet
got
some
one
to
attack
him
in
the
for
the
pleasure
of
replying
in
the
for
which
reason
the
first
edition
went
off
at
once
my
friends
upon
my
word
and
honor
i
can
not
write
two
words
in
praise
of
that
book
you
will
have
another
hundred
francs
interrupted
merlin
nathan
will
have
brought
you
in
ten
louis
to
say
nothing
of
an
article
that
you
might
put
in
finot
paper
you
would
get
a
hundred
francs
for
writing
that
and
another
hundred
francs
from
dauriat
total
twenty
louis
but
what
am
i
to
say
here
is
your
way
out
of
the
difficulty
said
blondet
after
some
thought
say
that
the
envy
that
fastens
on
all
good
work
like
wasps
on
ripe
fruit
has
attempted
to
set
its
fangs
in
this
production
the
captious
critic
trying
his
best
to
find
fault
has
been
obliged
to
invent
theories
for
that
purpose
and
has
drawn
a
distinction
between
two
kinds
of
literature
literature
of
ideas
and
the
literature
of
imagery
as
he
calls
them
on
the
heads
of
that
youngster
say
that
to
give
expression
to
ideas
through
imagery
is
the
highest
form
of
art
try
to
show
that
all
poetry
is
summed
up
in
that
and
lament
that
there
is
so
little
poetry
in
french
quote
foreign
criticisms
on
the
unimaginative
precision
of
our
style
and
then
extol
de
canalis
and
nathan
for
the
services
they
have
done
france
by
infusing
a
less
prosaic
spirit
into
the
language
knock
your
previous
argument
to
pieces
by
calling
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
have
made
progress
since
the
eighteenth
century
discover
the
a
beautiful
word
to
mystify
the
bourgeois
public
say
that
the
new
methods
in
literature
concentrate
all
styles
comedy
and
tragedy
description
and
dialogues
in
a
series
of
pictures
set
in
the
brilliant
frame
of
a
plot
which
holds
the
reader
interest
the
novel
which
demands
sentiment
style
and
imagery
is
the
greatest
creation
of
modern
days
it
is
the
successor
of
stage
comedy
grown
obsolete
with
its
restrictions
facts
and
ideas
are
all
within
the
province
of
fiction
the
intellect
of
an
incisive
moralist
like
la
bruyere
the
power
of
treating
character
as
moliere
could
treat
it
the
grand
machinery
of
a
shakespeare
together
with
the
portrayal
of
the
most
subtle
shades
of
passion
the
one
treasury
left
untouched
by
our
predecessors
for
all
this
the
modern
novel
affords
free
scope
how
far
superior
is
all
this
to
the
the
cold
analysis
to
the
eighteenth
century
novel
say
sententiously
the
epic
grown
amusing
instance
bring
mme
de
stael
up
to
support
your
argument
the
eighteenth
century
called
all
things
in
question
it
is
the
task
of
the
nineteenth
to
conclude
and
speak
the
last
word
and
the
last
word
of
the
nineteenth
century
has
been
for
realities
realities
which
live
however
and
move
passion
in
short
an
element
unknown
in
voltaire
philosophy
has
been
brought
into
play
here
a
diatribe
against
voltaire
and
as
for
rousseau
his
characters
are
polemics
and
systems
masquerading
julie
and
claire
are
entelechies
informing
spirit
awaiting
flesh
and
bones
you
might
slip
off
on
a
side
issue
at
this
and
say
that
we
owe
a
new
and
original
literature
to
the
peace
and
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
for
you
are
writing
for
a
right
centre
paper
scoff
at
founders
of
systems
and
cry
with
a
glow
of
fine
enthusiasm
are
errors
and
misleading
statements
in
abundance
in
our
contemporary
work
and
to
what
end
to
depreciate
a
fine
work
to
deceive
the
public
and
to
arrive
at
this
conclusion
a
book
that
sells
does
not
sell
mind
you
put
is
a
harmless
expletive
that
stimulates
the
reader
interest
foresee
the
approaching
decadence
of
criticism
in
fact
moral
is
but
one
kind
of
literature
the
literature
which
aims
to
please
nathan
has
started
upon
a
new
way
he
understands
his
epoch
and
fulfils
the
requirements
of
his
age
the
demand
for
drama
the
natural
demand
of
a
century
in
which
the
political
stage
has
become
a
permanent
puppet
show
have
we
not
seen
four
dramas
in
a
score
of
years
the
revolution
the
directory
the
empire
and
the
restoration
with
that
wallow
in
dithyramb
and
eulogy
and
the
second
edition
shall
vanish
like
smoke
this
is
the
way
to
do
it
next
saturday
put
a
review
in
our
magazine
and
sign
it
rubempre
out
in
full
in
that
final
article
say
that
work
always
brings
about
abundant
controversy
this
week
such
and
such
a
paper
contained
such
and
such
an
article
on
nathan
book
and
such
another
paper
made
a
vigorous
reply
then
you
criticise
the
critics
and
pay
me
a
passing
compliment
on
the
first
article
in
the
and
end
by
averring
that
nathan
work
is
the
great
book
of
the
epoch
which
is
all
as
if
you
said
nothing
at
all
they
say
the
same
of
everything
that
comes
out
and
so
continued
blondet
you
will
have
made
four
hundred
francs
in
a
week
to
say
nothing
of
the
pleasure
of
now
and
again
saying
what
you
really
think
a
discerning
public
will
maintain
that
either
c
or
l
or
rubempre
is
in
the
right
of
it
or
mayhap
all
the
three
mythology
beyond
doubt
one
of
the
grandest
inventions
of
the
human
brain
places
truth
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
and
what
are
we
to
do
without
buckets
you
will
have
supplied
the
public
with
three
for
one
there
you
are
my
boy
go
ahead
lucien
head
was
swimming
with
bewilderment
blondet
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
i
am
going
to
my
shop
said
he
and
every
man
likewise
departed
to
his
shop
for
these
a
newspaper
office
was
nothing
but
a
shop
they
were
to
meet
again
in
the
evening
at
the
wooden
galleries
and
lucien
would
sign
his
treaty
of
peace
with
dauriat
florine
and
lousteau
lucien
and
coralie
blondet
and
finot
were
to
dine
at
the
du
bruel
was
giving
the
manager
of
the
a
dinner
they
are
right
exclaimed
lucien
when
he
was
alone
with
coralie
men
are
made
to
be
tools
in
the
hands
of
stronger
spirits
four
hundred
francs
for
three
articles
doguereau
would
scarcely
give
me
as
much
for
a
book
which
cost
me
two
years
of
work
write
criticism
said
coralie
have
a
good
time
look
at
me
i
am
an
andalusian
girl
i
may
be
a
gypsy
and
a
man
the
night
after
do
as
i
do
give
them
grimaces
for
their
money
and
let
us
live
happily
lucien
smitten
with
love
of
paradox
set
himself
to
mount
and
ride
that
unruly
hybrid
product
of
pegasus
and
balaam
ass
started
out
at
a
gallop
over
the
fields
of
thought
while
he
took
a
turn
in
the
bois
and
discovered
new
possibilities
in
blondet
outline
he
dined
as
happy
people
dine
and
signed
away
all
his
rights
in
the
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
any
trouble
might
arise
from
that
transaction
in
the
future
he
took
a
turn
of
work
at
the
office
wrote
off
a
couple
of
columns
and
came
back
to
the
rue
de
vendome
next
morning
he
found
the
germs
of
yesterday
ideas
had
sprung
up
and
developed
in
his
brain
as
ideas
develop
while
the
intellect
is
yet
unjaded
and
the
sap
is
rising
and
thoroughly
did
he
enjoy
the
projection
of
this
new
article
he
threw
himself
into
it
with
enthusiasm
at
the
summons
of
the
spirit
of
contradiction
new
charms
met
beneath
his
pen
he
was
witty
and
satirical
he
rose
to
yet
new
views
of
sentiment
of
ideas
and
imagery
in
literature
with
subtle
ingenuity
he
went
back
to
his
own
first
impressions
of
nathan
work
when
he
read
it
in
the
newsroom
of
the
cour
du
commerce
and
the
ruthless
bloodthirsty
critic
the
lively
mocker
became
a
poet
in
the
final
phrases
which
rose
and
fell
with
majestic
rhythm
like
the
swaying
censer
before
the
altar
one
hundred
francs
coralie
cried
he
holding
up
eight
sheets
of
paper
covered
with
writing
while
she
dressed
the
mood
was
upon
him
he
went
on
to
indite
stroke
by
stroke
the
promised
terrible
article
on
chatelet
and
mme
de
bargeton
that
morning
he
experienced
one
of
the
keenest
personal
pleasures
of
journalism
he
knew
what
it
was
to
forge
the
epigram
to
whet
and
polish
the
cold
blade
to
be
sheathed
in
a
victim
heart
to
make
of
the
hilt
a
cunning
piece
of
workmanship
for
the
reader
to
admire
for
the
public
admires
the
handle
the
delicate
work
of
the
brain
while
the
cruelty
is
not
apparent
how
should
the
public
know
that
the
steel
of
the
epigram
tempered
in
the
fire
of
revenge
has
been
plunged
deftly
to
rankle
in
the
very
quick
of
a
victim
vanity
and
is
reeking
from
wounds
innumerable
which
it
has
inflicted
it
is
a
hideous
joy
that
grim
solitary
pleasure
relished
without
witnesses
it
is
like
a
duel
with
an
absent
enemy
slain
at
a
distance
by
a
quill
a
journalist
might
really
possess
the
magical
power
of
talismans
in
eastern
tales
epigram
is
distilled
rancor
the
quintessence
of
a
hate
derived
from
all
the
worst
passions
of
man
even
as
love
concentrates
all
that
is
best
in
human
nature
the
man
does
not
exist
who
can
not
be
witty
to
avenge
himself
and
by
the
same
rule
there
is
not
one
to
whom
love
does
not
bring
delight
cheap
and
easy
as
this
kind
of
wit
may
be
in
france
it
is
always
relished
lucien
article
was
destined
to
raise
the
previous
reputation
of
the
paper
for
venomous
spite
and
his
article
probed
two
hearts
to
the
depths
it
dealt
a
grievous
wound
to
mme
de
bargeton
his
laura
of
old
days
as
well
as
to
his
rival
the
baron
du
chatelet
well
let
us
go
for
a
drive
in
the
bois
said
coralie
the
horses
are
fidgeting
there
is
no
need
to
kill
yourself
we
will
take
the
article
on
nathan
to
hector
journalism
is
really
very
much
like
achilles
lance
it
salves
the
wounds
that
it
makes
said
lucien
correcting
a
phrase
here
and
there
the
lovers
started
forth
in
splendor
to
show
themselves
to
the
paris
which
had
but
lately
given
lucien
the
cold
shoulder
and
now
was
beginning
to
talk
about
him
to
have
paris
talking
of
you
and
this
after
you
have
learned
how
large
the
great
city
is
how
hard
it
is
to
be
anybody
there
it
was
this
thought
that
turned
lucien
head
with
exultation
let
us
go
by
way
of
your
tailor
dear
boy
and
tell
him
to
be
quick
with
your
clothes
or
try
them
on
if
they
are
ready
if
you
are
going
to
your
fine
ladies
houses
you
shall
eclipse
that
monster
of
a
de
marsay
and
young
rastignac
and
any
or
maxime
de
trailles
or
vandenesse
of
them
all
remember
that
your
mistress
is
coralie
but
you
will
not
play
me
any
tricks
eh
two
days
afterwards
on
the
eve
of
the
at
house
there
was
a
new
play
at
the
ambigu
and
it
fell
to
lucien
to
write
the
dramatic
criticism
lucien
and
coralie
walked
together
after
dinner
from
the
rue
de
vendome
to
the
going
along
the
cafe
turc
side
of
the
boulevard
du
temple
a
lounge
much
frequented
at
that
time
people
wondered
at
his
luck
and
praised
coralie
beauty
chance
remarks
reached
his
ears
some
said
that
coralie
was
the
finest
woman
in
paris
others
that
lucien
was
a
match
for
her
the
romantic
youth
felt
that
he
was
in
his
atmosphere
this
was
the
life
for
him
the
brotherhood
was
so
far
away
that
it
was
almost
out
of
sight
only
two
months
ago
how
he
had
looked
up
to
those
lofty
great
natures
now
he
asked
himself
if
they
were
not
just
a
trifle
ridiculous
with
their
notions
and
their
puritanism
careless
words
had
lodged
in
lucien
mind
and
begun
already
to
bear
fruit
he
took
coralie
to
her
and
strolled
about
like
a
sultan
behind
the
scenes
the
actresses
gave
him
burning
glances
and
flattering
speeches
i
must
go
to
the
ambigu
and
attend
to
business
said
he
at
the
ambigu
the
house
was
full
there
was
not
a
seat
left
for
him
indignant
complaints
behind
the
scenes
brought
no
redress
the
keeper
who
did
not
know
him
as
yet
said
that
they
had
sent
orders
for
two
boxes
to
his
paper
and
sent
him
about
his
business
i
shall
speak
of
the
play
as
i
find
it
said
lucien
nettled
at
this
what
a
dunce
you
are
said
the
leading
lady
addressing
the
keeper
that
is
coralie
adorer
the
keeper
turned
round
immediately
at
this
i
will
speak
to
the
manager
at
once
sir
he
said
in
all
these
small
details
lucien
saw
the
immense
power
wielded
by
the
press
his
vanity
was
gratified
the
manager
appeared
to
say
that
the
duc
de
rhetore
and
tullia
the
were
in
the
and
they
had
consented
to
allow
lucien
to
join
them
you
have
driven
two
people
to
distraction
remarked
the
young
duke
mentioning
the
names
of
the
baron
du
chatelet
and
mme
de
bargeton
distraction
what
will
it
be
said
lucien
so
far
my
friends
have
been
mere
skirmishers
but
i
have
given
them
shot
you
will
know
why
we
are
making
game
of
the
article
is
called
from
to
chatelet
will
be
a
byword
a
name
for
the
type
of
courtiers
who
deny
their
benefactor
and
rally
to
the
bourbons
when
i
have
done
with
him
i
am
going
to
mme
de
montcornet
lucien
talk
was
sparkling
he
was
eager
that
this
great
personage
should
see
how
gross
a
mistake
mesdames
and
de
bargeton
had
made
when
they
slighted
lucien
de
rubempre
but
he
showed
the
tip
of
his
ear
when
he
asserted
his
right
to
bear
the
name
of
rubempre
the
duc
de
rhetore
having
purposely
addressed
him
as
chardon
you
should
go
over
to
the
royalists
said
the
duke
you
have
proved
yourself
a
man
of
ability
now
show
your
good
sense
the
one
way
of
obtaining
a
patent
of
nobility
and
the
right
to
bear
the
title
of
your
mother
family
is
by
asking
for
it
in
return
for
services
to
be
rendered
to
the
court
the
liberals
will
never
make
a
count
of
you
the
restoration
will
get
the
better
of
the
press
you
see
in
the
long
run
and
the
press
is
the
only
formidable
power
they
have
borne
with
it
too
long
as
it
is
the
press
is
sure
to
be
muzzled
take
advantage
of
the
last
moments
of
liberty
to
make
yourself
formidable
and
you
will
have
everything
intellect
nobility
and
good
looks
nothing
will
be
out
of
your
reach
so
if
you
are
a
liberal
let
it
be
simply
for
the
moment
so
that
you
can
make
a
better
bargain
for
your
royalism
with
that
the
duke
entreated
lucien
to
accept
an
invitation
to
dinner
which
the
german
minister
of
florine
was
about
to
send
lucien
fell
under
the
charm
of
the
noble
peer
arguments
the
salons
from
which
he
had
been
exiled
for
ever
as
he
thought
but
a
few
months
ago
would
shortly
open
their
doors
for
him
he
was
delighted
he
marveled
at
the
power
of
the
press
intellect
and
the
press
these
then
were
the
real
powers
in
society
another
thought
shaped
itself
in
his
mind
was
etienne
lousteau
sorry
that
he
had
opened
the
gate
of
the
temple
to
a
newcomer
even
now
he
lucien
felt
on
his
own
account
that
it
was
strongly
advisable
to
put
difficulties
in
the
way
of
eager
and
ambitious
recruits
from
the
provinces
if
a
poet
should
come
to
him
as
he
had
flung
himself
into
etienne
arms
he
dared
not
think
of
the
reception
that
he
would
give
him
the
youthful
duke
meanwhile
saw
that
lucien
was
deep
in
thought
and
made
a
pretty
good
guess
at
the
matter
of
his
meditations
he
himself
had
opened
out
wide
horizons
of
public
life
before
an
ambitious
poet
with
a
vacillating
will
it
is
true
but
not
without
aspirations
and
the
journalists
had
already
shown
the
neophyte
from
a
pinnacle
of
the
temple
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
of
letters
and
its
riches
lucien
himself
had
no
suspicion
of
a
little
plot
that
was
being
woven
nor
did
he
imagine
that
de
rhetore
had
a
hand
in
it
de
rhetore
had
spoken
of
lucien
cleverness
and
mme
set
had
taken
alarm
mme
de
bargeton
had
commissioned
the
duke
to
sound
lucien
and
with
that
object
in
view
the
noble
youth
had
come
to
the
do
not
believe
in
stories
of
elaborate
treachery
neither
the
great
world
nor
the
world
of
journalists
laid
any
deep
schemes
definite
plans
are
not
made
by
either
their
machiavelism
lives
from
hand
to
mouth
so
to
speak
and
consists
for
the
most
part
in
being
always
on
the
spot
always
on
the
alert
to
turn
everything
to
account
always
on
the
watch
for
the
moment
when
a
man
ruling
passion
shall
deliver
him
into
the
hands
of
his
enemies
the
young
duke
had
seen
through
lucien
at
florine
he
had
just
touched
his
vain
susceptibilities
and
now
he
was
trying
his
first
efforts
in
diplomacy
upon
the
living
subject
lucien
hurried
to
the
rue
after
the
play
to
write
his
article
it
was
a
piece
of
savage
and
bitter
criticism
written
in
pure
wantonness
he
was
amusing
himself
by
trying
his
power
the
melodrama
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
a
better
piece
than
the
but
lucien
wished
to
see
whether
he
could
damn
a
good
play
and
send
everybody
to
see
a
bad
one
as
his
associates
had
said
he
unfolded
the
sheet
at
breakfast
next
morning
telling
coralie
as
he
did
so
that
he
had
cut
up
the
and
not
a
little
astonished
was
he
to
find
below
his
paper
on
mme
de
bargeton
and
chatelet
a
notice
of
the
ambigu
so
mellowed
and
softened
in
the
course
of
the
night
that
although
the
witty
analysis
was
still
preserved
the
judgment
was
favorable
the
article
was
more
likely
to
fill
the
house
than
to
empty
it
no
words
can
describe
his
wrath
he
determined
to
have
a
word
or
two
with
lousteau
he
had
already
begun
to
think
himself
an
indespensable
man
and
he
vowed
that
he
would
not
submit
to
be
tyrannized
over
and
treated
like
a
fool
to
establish
his
power
beyond
cavil
he
wrote
the
article
for
dauriat
review
summing
up
and
weighing
all
the
various
opinions
concerning
nathan
book
and
while
he
was
in
the
humor
he
hit
off
another
of
his
short
sketches
for
lousteau
newspaper
inexperienced
journalists
in
the
first
effervescence
of
youth
make
a
labor
of
love
of
ephemeral
work
and
lavish
their
best
thought
unthriftily
thereon
the
manager
of
the
gave
a
first
performance
of
a
vaudeville
that
night
so
that
florine
and
coralie
might
be
free
for
the
evening
there
were
to
be
cards
before
supper
lousteau
came
for
the
short
notice
of
the
vaudeville
it
had
been
written
beforehand
after
the
general
rehearsal
for
etienne
wished
to
have
the
paper
off
his
mind
lucien
read
over
one
of
the
charming
sketches
of
parisian
whimsicalities
which
made
the
fortune
of
the
paper
and
lousteau
kissed
him
on
both
eyelids
and
called
him
the
providence
of
journalism
then
why
do
you
amuse
yourself
by
turning
my
article
inside
out
asked
lucien
he
had
written
his
brilliant
sketch
simply
and
solely
to
give
emphasis
to
his
grievance
exclaimed
lousteau
well
who
else
can
have
altered
my
article
you
do
not
know
all
the
ins
and
outs
yet
dear
fellow
the
ambigu
pays
for
thirty
copies
and
only
takes
nine
for
the
manager
and
box
and
their
mistresses
and
for
the
three
lessees
of
the
theatre
every
one
of
the
boulevard
theatres
pays
eight
hundred
francs
in
this
way
to
the
paper
and
there
is
quite
as
much
again
in
boxes
and
orders
for
finot
to
say
nothing
of
the
contributions
of
the
company
and
if
the
minor
theatres
do
this
you
may
imagine
what
the
big
ones
do
now
you
understand
we
are
bound
to
show
a
good
deal
of
indulgence
i
understand
this
that
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
write
as
i
think
eh
what
does
that
matter
so
long
as
you
turn
an
honest
penny
cried
lousteau
besides
my
boy
what
grudge
had
you
against
the
theatre
you
must
have
had
some
reason
for
it
or
you
would
not
have
cut
up
the
play
as
you
did
if
you
slash
for
the
sake
of
slashing
the
paper
will
get
into
trouble
and
when
there
is
good
reason
for
hitting
hard
it
will
not
tell
did
the
manager
leave
you
out
in
the
cold
he
had
not
kept
a
place
for
me
good
said
lousteau
i
shall
let
him
see
your
article
and
tell
him
that
i
softened
it
down
you
will
find
it
serves
you
better
than
if
it
had
appeared
in
print
go
and
ask
him
for
tickets
and
he
will
sign
forty
blank
orders
every
month
i
know
a
man
who
can
get
rid
of
them
for
you
i
will
introduce
you
to
him
and
he
will
buy
them
all
up
at
there
is
a
trade
done
in
theatre
tickets
just
as
barbet
trades
in
reviewers
copies
this
is
another
barbet
the
leader
of
the
he
lives
near
by
come
and
see
him
there
is
time
enough
but
my
dear
fellow
it
is
a
scandalous
thing
that
finot
should
levy
blackmail
in
matters
intellectual
sooner
or
later
really
cried
lousteau
where
do
you
come
from
for
what
do
you
take
finot
beneath
his
pretence
of
his
ignorance
and
stupidity
and
those
turcaret
airs
of
his
there
is
all
the
cunning
of
his
father
the
hatter
did
you
notice
an
old
soldier
of
the
empire
in
the
den
at
the
office
that
is
finot
uncle
the
uncle
is
not
only
one
of
the
right
sort
he
has
the
luck
to
be
taken
for
a
fool
and
he
takes
all
that
kind
of
business
upon
his
shoulders
an
ambitious
man
in
paris
is
well
off
indeed
if
he
has
a
willing
scapegoat
at
hand
in
public
life
as
in
journalism
there
are
hosts
of
emergencies
in
which
the
chiefs
can
not
afford
to
appear
if
finot
should
enter
on
a
political
career
his
uncle
would
be
his
secretary
and
receive
all
the
contributions
levied
in
his
department
on
big
affairs
anybody
would
take
giroudeau
for
a
fool
at
first
sight
but
he
has
just
enough
shrewdness
to
be
an
inscrutable
old
file
he
is
on
picket
duty
he
sees
that
we
are
not
pestered
with
hubbub
beginners
wanting
a
job
or
advertisements
no
other
paper
has
his
equal
i
think
he
plays
his
part
well
said
lucien
i
saw
him
at
work
etienne
and
lucien
reached
a
handsome
house
in
the
rue
du
is
braulard
in
etienne
asked
of
the
porter
said
lucien
then
is
the
leader
of
the
my
dear
boy
braulard
has
twenty
thousand
francs
of
income
all
the
dramatic
authors
of
the
boulevards
are
in
his
clutches
and
have
a
standing
account
with
him
as
if
he
were
a
banker
orders
and
complimentary
tickets
are
sold
here
braulard
knows
where
to
get
rid
of
such
merchandise
now
for
a
turn
at
statistics
a
useful
science
enough
in
its
way
at
the
rate
of
fifty
complimentary
tickets
every
evening
for
each
theatre
you
have
two
hundred
and
fifty
tickets
daily
suppose
taking
one
with
another
that
they
are
worth
a
couple
of
francs
apiece
braulard
pays
a
hundred
and
francs
daily
for
them
and
takes
his
chance
of
making
cent
per
cent
in
this
way
authors
tickets
alone
bring
him
in
about
four
thousand
francs
every
month
or
thousand
francs
per
annum
allow
twenty
thousand
francs
for
loss
for
he
can
not
always
place
all
his
tickets
why
not
oh
the
people
who
pay
at
the
door
go
in
with
the
holders
of
complimentary
tickets
for
unreserved
seats
and
the
theatre
reserves
the
right
of
admitting
those
who
pay
there
are
fine
warm
evenings
to
be
reckoned
with
besides
and
poor
plays
braulard
makes
perhaps
thirty
thousand
francs
every
year
in
this
way
and
he
has
his
besides
another
industry
florine
and
coralie
pay
tribute
to
him
if
they
did
not
there
would
be
no
applause
when
they
come
on
or
go
off
lousteau
gave
this
explanation
in
a
low
voice
as
they
went
up
the
stair
paris
is
a
queer
place
said
lucien
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
saw
squatting
in
every
corner
a
smart
opened
the
door
at
the
sight
of
etienne
lousteau
the
dealer
in
orders
and
tickets
rose
from
a
sturdy
chair
before
a
large
cylinder
desk
and
lucien
beheld
the
leader
of
the
braulard
himself
dressed
in
a
gray
molleton
jacket
footed
trousers
and
red
slippers
for
all
the
world
like
a
doctor
or
a
solicitor
he
was
a
typical
man
lucien
thought
a
face
with
a
pair
of
exceedingly
cunning
gray
eyes
hands
made
for
hired
applause
a
complexion
over
which
hard
living
had
passed
like
rain
over
a
roof
grizzled
hair
and
a
somewhat
husky
voice
you
have
come
from
mlle
florine
no
doubt
sir
and
this
gentleman
for
mlle
coralie
said
braulard
i
know
you
very
well
by
sight
do
trouble
yourself
sir
he
continued
addressing
lucien
i
am
buying
the
gymnase
connection
i
will
look
after
your
lady
and
i
will
give
her
notice
of
any
tricks
they
may
try
to
play
on
her
that
is
not
an
offer
to
be
refused
my
dear
braulard
but
we
have
come
about
the
press
orders
for
the
boulevard
theatres
i
as
editor
and
this
gentleman
as
dramatic
critic
oh
ah
yes
finot
has
sold
his
paper
i
heard
about
it
he
is
getting
on
is
finot
i
have
asked
him
to
dine
with
me
at
the
end
of
the
week
if
you
will
do
me
the
honor
and
pleasure
of
coming
you
may
bring
your
ladies
and
there
will
be
a
grand
jollification
adele
dupuis
is
coming
and
ducange
and
frederic
du
and
mlle
millot
my
mistress
we
shall
have
good
fun
and
better
liquor
ducange
must
be
in
difficulties
he
has
lost
his
lawsuit
i
have
lent
him
ten
thousand
francs
if
succeeds
it
will
repay
the
loan
so
i
have
been
organizing
a
success
ducange
is
a
clever
man
he
has
brains
lucien
fancied
that
he
must
be
dreaming
when
he
heard
a
appraising
a
writer
value
coralie
has
improved
continued
braulard
with
the
air
of
a
competent
critic
if
she
is
a
good
girl
i
will
take
her
part
for
they
have
got
up
a
cabal
against
her
at
the
gymnase
this
is
how
i
mean
to
do
it
i
will
have
a
few
men
in
the
balconies
to
smile
and
make
a
little
murmur
and
the
applause
will
follow
that
is
a
dodge
which
makes
a
position
for
an
actress
i
have
a
liking
for
coralie
and
you
ought
to
be
satisfied
for
she
has
feeling
aha
i
can
hiss
any
one
on
the
stage
if
i
like
but
let
us
settle
this
business
about
the
tickets
put
in
lousteau
very
well
i
will
come
to
this
gentleman
lodging
for
them
at
the
beginning
of
the
month
he
is
a
friend
of
yours
and
i
will
treat
him
as
i
do
you
you
have
five
theatres
you
will
get
thirty
tickets
that
will
be
something
like
francs
a
month
perhaps
you
will
be
wanting
an
advance
added
braulard
lifting
a
full
of
coin
out
of
his
desk
no
no
said
lousteau
we
will
keep
that
shift
against
a
rainy
day
i
will
work
with
coralie
sir
and
we
will
come
to
an
understanding
said
braulard
addressing
lucien
who
was
looking
about
him
not
without
profound
astonishment
there
was
a
bookcase
in
study
there
were
framed
engravings
and
good
furniture
and
as
they
passed
through
the
drawing
room
he
noticed
that
the
fittings
were
neither
too
luxurious
nor
yet
mean
the
seemed
to
be
the
best
ordered
room
he
remarked
on
this
jokingly
but
braulard
is
an
epicure
said
lousteau
his
dinners
are
famous
in
dramatic
literature
and
they
are
what
you
might
expect
from
his
i
have
good
wine
braulard
replied
ah
here
are
my
lamplighters
he
added
as
a
sound
of
hoarse
voices
and
strange
footsteps
came
up
from
the
staircase
lucien
on
his
way
down
saw
a
march
past
of
and
retailers
of
tickets
it
was
an
ill
smelling
squad
attired
in
caps
seedy
trousers
and
threadbare
overcoats
a
flock
of
with
bluish
and
greenish
tints
in
their
faces
neglected
beards
and
a
strange
mixture
of
savagery
and
subservience
in
their
eyes
a
horrible
population
lives
and
swarms
upon
the
paris
boulevards
selling
watch
guards
and
brass
jewelry
in
the
streets
by
day
applauding
under
the
chandeliers
of
the
theatre
at
night
and
ready
to
lend
themselves
to
any
dirty
business
in
the
great
city
behold
the
romans
laughed
lousteau
behold
fame
incarnate
for
actresses
and
dramatic
authors
it
is
no
prettier
than
our
own
when
you
come
to
look
at
it
close
it
is
difficult
to
keep
illusions
on
any
subject
in
paris
answered
lucien
as
they
turned
in
at
his
door
there
is
a
tax
upon
everything
everything
has
its
price
and
anything
can
be
made
to
order
even
success
thirty
guests
were
assembled
that
evening
in
coralie
rooms
her
dining
room
would
not
hold
more
lucien
had
asked
dauriat
and
the
manager
of
the
matifat
and
florine
camusot
lousteau
finot
nathan
hector
merlin
and
mme
du
felicien
vernou
blondet
vignon
philippe
bridau
mariette
giroudeau
cardot
and
florentine
and
bixiou
he
had
also
asked
all
his
friends
of
the
rue
des
tullia
the
dancer
who
was
not
unkind
said
gossip
to
du
bruel
had
come
without
her
duke
the
proprietors
of
the
newspapers
for
whom
most
of
the
journalists
wrote
were
also
of
the
party
at
eight
when
the
lights
of
the
candles
in
the
chandeliers
shone
over
the
furniture
the
hangings
and
the
flowers
the
rooms
wore
the
festal
air
that
gives
to
parisian
luxury
the
appearance
of
a
dream
and
lucien
felt
indefinable
stirrings
of
hope
and
gratified
vanity
and
pleasure
at
the
thought
that
he
was
the
master
of
the
house
but
how
and
by
whom
the
magic
wand
had
been
waved
he
no
longer
sought
to
remember
florine
and
coralie
dressed
with
the
fanciful
extravagance
and
magnificent
artistic
effect
of
the
stage
smiled
on
the
poet
like
two
fairies
at
the
gates
of
the
palace
of
dreams
and
lucien
was
almost
in
a
dream
his
life
had
been
changed
so
suddenly
during
the
last
few
months
he
had
gone
so
swiftly
from
the
depths
of
penury
to
the
last
extreme
of
luxury
that
at
moments
he
felt
as
uncomfortable
as
a
dreaming
man
who
knows
that
he
is
asleep
and
yet
he
looked
round
at
the
fair
reality
about
him
with
a
confidence
to
which
envious
minds
might
have
given
the
name
of
fatuity
lucien
himself
had
changed
he
had
grown
paler
during
these
days
of
continual
enjoyment
languor
had
lent
a
humid
look
to
his
eyes
in
short
to
use
mme
expression
he
looked
like
a
man
who
is
loved
he
was
the
handsomer
for
it
consciousness
of
his
powers
and
his
strength
was
visible
in
his
face
enlightened
as
it
was
by
love
and
experience
looking
out
over
the
world
of
letters
and
of
men
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
might
go
to
and
fro
as
lord
of
it
all
sober
reflection
never
entered
his
romantic
head
unless
it
was
driven
in
by
the
pressure
of
adversity
and
just
now
the
present
held
not
a
care
for
him
the
breath
of
praise
swelled
the
sails
of
his
skiff
all
the
instruments
of
success
lay
there
to
his
hand
he
had
an
establishment
a
mistress
whom
all
paris
envied
him
a
carriage
and
untold
wealth
in
his
inkstand
heart
and
soul
and
brain
were
alike
transformed
within
him
why
should
he
care
to
be
over
nice
about
the
means
when
the
great
results
were
visibly
there
before
his
eyes
as
such
a
style
of
living
will
seem
and
with
good
reason
to
be
anything
but
secure
to
economists
who
have
any
experience
of
paris
it
will
not
be
superfluous
to
give
a
glance
to
the
foundation
uncertain
as
it
was
upon
which
the
prosperity
of
the
pair
was
based
camusot
had
given
coralie
tradesmen
instructions
to
grant
her
credit
for
three
months
at
least
and
this
had
been
done
without
her
knowledge
during
those
three
months
therefore
horses
and
servants
like
everything
else
waited
as
if
by
enchantment
at
the
bidding
of
two
children
eager
for
enjoyment
and
enjoying
to
their
content
coralie
had
taken
lucien
hand
and
given
him
a
glimpse
of
the
transformation
scene
in
the
of
the
splendidly
appointed
table
of
chandeliers
each
fitted
with
forty
of
the
royally
luxurious
dessert
and
a
menu
of
chevet
lucien
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
and
held
her
closely
to
his
heart
i
shall
succeed
child
he
said
and
then
i
will
repay
you
for
such
love
and
devotion
pshaw
said
coralie
are
you
satisfied
i
should
be
very
hard
to
please
if
i
were
not
very
well
then
that
smile
of
yours
pays
for
everything
she
said
and
with
a
serpentine
movement
she
raised
her
head
and
laid
her
lips
against
his
when
they
went
back
to
the
others
florine
lousteau
matifat
and
camusot
were
setting
out
the
lucien
friends
began
to
arrive
for
already
these
folk
began
to
call
themselves
friends
and
they
sat
over
the
cards
from
nine
till
midnight
lucien
was
unacquainted
with
a
single
game
but
lousteau
lost
a
thousand
francs
and
lucien
could
not
refuse
to
lend
him
the
money
when
he
asked
for
it
michel
fulgence
and
joseph
appeared
about
ten
and
lucien
chatting
with
them
in
a
corner
saw
that
they
looked
sober
and
serious
enough
not
to
say
ill
at
ease
could
not
come
he
was
finishing
his
book
leon
giraud
was
busy
with
the
first
number
of
his
review
so
the
brotherhood
had
sent
three
artists
among
their
number
thinking
that
they
would
feel
less
out
of
their
element
in
an
uproarious
supper
party
than
the
rest
well
my
dear
fellows
said
lucien
assuming
a
slightly
patronizing
tone
the
fellow
may
become
a
great
public
character
yet
you
see
i
wish
i
may
be
mistaken
i
do
ask
better
said
michel
are
you
living
with
coralie
until
you
can
do
better
asked
fulgence
yes
said
lucien
trying
to
look
unconscious
coralie
had
an
elderly
adorer
a
merchant
and
she
showed
him
the
door
poor
fellow
i
am
better
off
than
your
brother
philippe
he
added
addressing
joseph
bridau
he
does
not
know
how
to
manage
mariette
you
are
a
man
like
another
now
in
short
you
will
make
your
way
said
fulgence
a
man
that
will
always
be
the
same
for
you
under
all
circumstances
returned
lucien
michel
and
fulgence
exchanged
incredulous
scornful
smiles
at
this
lucien
saw
the
absurdity
of
his
remark
coralie
is
wonderfully
beautiful
exclaimed
joseph
bridau
what
a
magnificent
portrait
she
would
make
beautiful
and
good
said
lucien
she
is
an
angel
upon
my
word
and
you
shall
paint
her
portrait
she
shall
sit
to
you
if
you
like
for
your
venetian
lady
brought
by
the
old
woman
to
the
senator
all
women
who
love
are
angelic
said
michel
chrestien
just
at
that
moment
raoul
nathan
flew
upon
lucien
and
grasped
both
his
hands
and
shook
them
in
a
sudden
access
of
violent
friendship
oh
my
good
friend
you
are
something
more
than
a
great
man
you
have
a
heart
cried
he
a
much
rarer
thing
than
genius
in
these
days
you
are
a
devoted
friend
i
am
yours
in
short
through
thick
and
thin
i
shall
never
forget
all
that
you
have
done
for
me
this
week
lucien
joy
had
reached
the
highest
point
to
be
thus
caressed
by
a
man
of
whom
everyone
was
talking
he
looked
at
his
three
friends
of
the
brotherhood
with
something
like
a
superior
air
appearance
upon
the
scene
was
the
result
of
an
overture
from
merlin
who
sent
him
a
proof
of
the
favorable
review
to
appear
in
issue
i
only
consented
to
write
the
attack
on
condition
that
i
should
be
allowed
to
reply
to
it
myself
lucien
said
in
nathan
ear
i
am
one
of
you
this
incident
was
opportune
it
justified
the
remark
which
amused
fulgence
lucien
was
radiant
when
book
comes
out
he
said
turning
to
the
three
i
am
in
a
position
to
be
useful
to
him
that
thought
in
itself
would
induce
me
to
remain
a
journalist
can
you
do
as
you
like
michel
asked
quickly
so
far
as
one
can
when
one
is
indispensable
said
lucien
modestly
it
was
almost
midnight
when
they
sat
down
to
supper
and
the
fun
grew
fast
and
furious
talk
was
less
restrained
in
lucien
house
than
at
matifat
for
no
one
suspected
that
the
representatives
of
the
brotherhood
and
the
newspaper
writers
held
divergent
opinions
young
intellects
depraved
by
arguing
for
either
side
now
came
into
conflict
with
each
other
and
fearful
axioms
of
the
journalistic
jurisprudence
then
in
its
infancy
hurtled
to
and
fro
claude
vignon
upholding
the
dignity
of
criticism
inveighed
against
the
tendency
of
the
smaller
newspapers
saying
that
the
writers
of
personalities
lowered
themselves
in
the
end
lousteau
merlin
and
finot
took
up
the
cudgels
for
the
system
known
by
the
name
of
puffery
gossip
and
humbug
said
they
was
the
test
of
talent
and
set
the
as
it
were
upon
it
any
man
who
can
stand
that
test
has
real
power
said
lousteau
besides
cried
merlin
when
a
great
man
receives
ovations
there
ought
to
be
a
chorus
in
insults
to
balance
as
in
a
roman
triumph
oho
put
in
lucien
then
every
one
held
up
to
ridicule
in
print
will
fancy
that
he
has
made
a
success
any
one
would
think
that
the
question
interested
you
exclaimed
finot
and
how
about
our
sonnets
said
michel
chrestien
is
that
the
way
they
will
win
us
the
fame
of
a
second
petrarch
laura
already
counts
for
something
in
his
fame
said
dauriat
a
pun
laure
received
with
acclamations
experimentum
in
anima
retorted
lucien
with
a
smile
and
woe
unto
him
whom
reviewers
shall
spare
flinging
him
crowns
at
his
first
appearance
for
he
shall
be
shelved
like
the
saints
in
their
shrines
and
no
man
shall
pay
him
the
slightest
attention
said
vernou
people
will
say
elsewhere
simpleton
you
have
had
your
due
already
as
champcenetz
said
to
the
marquis
de
genlis
who
was
looking
too
fondly
at
his
wife
added
blondet
success
is
the
ruin
of
a
man
in
france
said
finot
we
are
so
jealous
of
one
another
that
we
try
to
forget
and
to
make
others
forget
the
triumphs
of
yesterday
contradiction
is
the
life
of
literature
in
fact
said
claude
vignon
in
art
as
in
nature
there
are
two
principles
everywhere
at
strife
exclaimed
fulgence
and
victory
for
either
means
death
so
it
is
with
politics
added
michel
chrestien
we
have
a
case
in
point
said
lousteau
dauriat
will
sell
a
couple
of
thousand
copies
of
nathan
book
in
the
coming
week
and
why
because
the
book
that
was
cleverly
attacked
will
be
ably
defended
merlin
took
up
the
proof
of
paper
how
can
such
an
article
fail
to
sell
an
edition
he
asked
read
the
article
said
dauriat
i
am
a
publisher
wherever
i
am
even
at
supper
merlin
read
lucien
triumphant
refutation
aloud
and
the
whole
party
applauded
how
could
that
article
have
been
written
unless
the
attack
had
preceded
it
asked
lousteau
dauriat
drew
the
proof
of
the
third
article
from
his
pocket
and
read
it
over
finot
listening
closely
for
it
was
to
appear
in
the
second
number
of
his
own
review
and
as
editor
he
exaggerated
his
enthusiasm
gentlemen
said
he
so
and
not
otherwise
would
bossuet
have
written
if
he
had
lived
in
our
day
i
am
sure
of
it
said
merlin
bossuet
would
have
been
a
journalist
to
bossuet
the
second
cried
claude
vignon
raising
his
glass
with
an
ironical
bow
to
my
christopher
columbus
returned
lucien
drinking
a
health
to
dauriat
bravo
cried
nathan
is
it
a
nickname
merlin
inquired
looking
maliciously
from
finot
to
lucien
if
you
go
on
at
this
pace
you
will
be
quite
beyond
us
said
dauriat
these
gentlemen
indicating
camusot
and
matifat
can
not
follow
you
as
it
is
a
joke
is
like
a
bit
of
thread
if
it
is
spun
too
fine
it
breaks
as
bonaparte
said
gentlemen
said
lousteau
we
have
been
of
a
strange
portentous
and
truly
surprising
phenomenon
admire
the
rapidity
with
which
our
friend
here
has
been
transformed
from
a
provincial
into
a
journalist
he
is
a
born
journalist
said
dauriat
children
called
finot
rising
to
his
feet
all
of
us
here
present
have
encouraged
and
protected
our
amphitryon
in
his
entrance
upon
a
career
in
which
he
has
already
surpassed
our
hopes
in
two
months
he
has
shown
us
what
he
can
do
in
a
series
of
excellent
articles
known
to
us
all
i
propose
to
baptize
him
in
form
as
a
journalist
a
crown
of
roses
to
signalize
a
double
conquest
cried
bixiou
glancing
at
coralie
coralie
made
a
sign
to
berenice
that
portly
handmaid
went
to
coralie
and
brought
back
a
box
of
tumbled
artificial
flowers
the
more
incapable
members
of
the
party
were
grotesquely
tricked
out
in
these
blossoms
and
a
crown
of
roses
was
soon
woven
finot
as
high
priest
sprinkled
a
few
drops
of
champagne
on
golden
curls
pronouncing
with
delicious
gravity
the
words
in
the
name
of
the
government
stamp
the
and
the
fine
i
baptize
thee
journalist
may
thy
articles
sit
lightly
on
thee
and
may
they
be
paid
for
including
white
lines
cried
merlin
just
at
that
moment
lucien
caught
sight
of
three
melancholy
faces
michel
chrestien
joseph
bridau
and
fulgence
ridal
took
up
their
hats
and
went
out
amid
a
storm
of
invective
queer
customers
said
merlin
fulgence
used
to
be
a
good
fellow
added
lousteau
before
they
perverted
his
morals
who
are
asked
claude
vignon
some
very
serious
young
men
said
blondet
who
meet
at
a
symposium
in
the
rue
des
and
worry
themselves
about
the
meaning
of
human
life
oh
oh
they
are
trying
to
find
out
whether
it
goes
round
in
a
circle
or
makes
some
progress
continued
blondet
they
were
very
hard
put
to
it
between
the
straight
line
and
the
curve
the
triangle
warranted
by
scripture
seemed
to
them
to
be
nonsense
when
lo
there
arose
among
them
some
prophet
or
other
who
declared
for
the
spiral
men
might
meet
to
invent
more
dangerous
nonsense
than
that
exclaimed
lucien
making
a
faint
attempt
to
champion
the
brotherhood
you
take
theories
of
that
sort
for
idle
words
said
felicien
vernou
but
a
time
comes
when
the
arguments
take
the
form
of
gunshot
and
the
guillotine
they
have
not
come
to
that
yet
said
bixiou
they
have
only
come
as
far
as
the
designs
of
providence
in
the
invention
of
champagne
the
humanitarian
significance
of
breeches
and
the
blind
deity
who
keeps
the
world
going
they
pick
up
fallen
great
men
like
vico
and
fourier
i
am
much
afraid
that
they
will
turn
poor
joseph
head
among
them
bianchon
my
old
schoolfellow
gives
me
the
cold
shoulder
now
said
lousteau
it
is
all
their
doing
do
they
give
lectures
on
orthopedy
and
intellectual
gymnastics
asked
merlin
very
likely
answered
finot
if
bianchon
has
any
hand
in
their
theories
pshaw
said
lousteau
he
will
be
a
great
physician
anyhow
is
their
visible
head
asked
nathan
a
little
youngster
that
is
going
to
swallow
all
of
us
up
he
is
a
genius
cried
lucien
genius
is
he
well
give
me
a
glass
of
sherry
said
claude
vignon
smiling
every
one
thereupon
began
to
explain
his
character
for
the
benefit
of
his
neighbor
and
when
a
clever
man
feels
a
pressing
need
of
explaining
himself
and
of
unlocking
his
heart
it
is
pretty
clear
that
wine
has
got
the
upper
hand
an
hour
later
all
the
men
in
the
company
were
the
best
friends
in
the
world
addressing
each
other
as
great
men
and
bold
spirits
who
held
the
future
in
their
hands
lucien
in
his
quality
of
host
was
sufficiently
clearheaded
to
apprehend
the
meaning
of
the
sophistries
which
impressed
him
and
completed
his
demoralization
the
liberal
party
announced
finot
is
compelled
to
stir
up
discussion
somehow
there
is
no
fault
to
find
with
the
action
of
the
government
and
you
may
imagine
what
a
fix
the
opposition
is
in
which
of
you
now
cares
to
write
a
pamphlet
in
favor
of
the
system
of
primogeniture
and
raise
a
cry
against
the
secret
designs
of
the
court
the
pamphlet
will
be
paid
for
handsomely
i
will
write
it
said
hector
merlin
it
is
my
own
point
of
view
your
party
will
complain
that
you
are
compromising
them
said
finot
felicien
you
must
undertake
it
dauriat
will
bring
it
out
and
we
will
keep
the
secret
how
much
shall
i
get
six
hundred
francs
sign
it
comte
c
three
stars
it
a
bargain
said
felicien
vernou
so
you
are
introducing
the
to
the
political
world
remarked
lousteau
it
is
simply
the
chabot
affair
carried
into
the
region
of
abstract
ideas
said
finot
fasten
intentions
on
the
government
and
then
let
loose
public
opinion
how
a
government
can
leave
the
control
of
ideas
to
such
a
pack
of
scamps
as
we
are
is
matter
for
perpetual
and
profound
astonishment
to
me
said
claude
vignon
if
the
ministry
blunders
so
far
as
to
come
down
into
the
arena
we
can
give
them
a
drubbing
if
they
are
nettled
by
it
the
thing
will
rankle
in
people
minds
and
the
government
will
lose
its
hold
on
the
masses
the
newspaper
risks
nothing
and
the
authorities
have
everything
to
lose
france
will
be
a
cipher
until
newspapers
are
abolished
by
law
said
claude
vignon
you
are
making
progress
hourly
he
added
addressing
finot
you
are
a
modern
order
of
jesuits
lacking
the
creed
the
fixed
idea
the
discipline
and
the
union
they
went
back
to
the
and
before
long
the
light
of
the
candles
grew
feeble
in
the
dawn
lucien
your
friends
from
the
rue
des
looked
as
dismal
as
criminals
going
to
be
hanged
said
coralie
they
were
the
judges
not
the
criminals
replied
the
poet
judges
are
more
amusing
than
said
coralie
for
a
month
lucien
whole
time
was
taken
up
with
supper
parties
dinner
engagements
breakfasts
and
evening
parties
he
was
swept
away
by
an
irresistible
current
into
a
vortex
of
dissipation
and
easy
work
he
no
longer
thought
of
the
future
the
power
of
calculation
amid
the
complications
of
life
is
the
sign
of
a
strong
will
which
poets
weaklings
and
men
who
live
a
purely
intellectual
life
can
never
counterfeit
lucien
was
living
from
hand
to
mouth
spending
his
money
as
fast
as
he
made
it
like
many
another
journalist
nor
did
he
give
so
much
as
a
thought
to
those
periodically
recurrent
days
of
reckoning
which
chequer
the
life
of
the
bohemian
in
paris
so
sadly
in
dress
and
figure
he
was
a
rival
for
the
great
dandies
of
the
day
coralie
like
all
zealots
loved
to
adorn
her
idol
she
ruined
herself
to
give
her
beloved
poet
the
accoutrements
which
had
so
stirred
his
envy
in
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
lucien
had
wonderful
canes
and
a
charming
eyeglass
he
had
diamond
studs
and
and
besides
an
assortment
of
waistcoats
marvelous
to
behold
and
in
sufficient
number
to
match
every
color
in
a
variety
of
costumes
his
transition
to
the
estate
of
dandy
swiftly
followed
when
he
went
to
the
german
minister
dinner
all
the
young
men
regarded
him
with
suppressed
envy
yet
de
marsay
vandenesse
maxime
de
trailles
rastignac
beaudenord
manerville
and
the
duc
de
maufrigneuse
gave
place
to
none
in
the
kingdom
of
fashion
men
of
fashion
are
as
jealous
among
themselves
as
women
and
in
the
same
way
lucien
was
placed
between
mme
de
montcornet
and
mme
in
whose
honor
the
dinner
was
given
both
ladies
overwhelmed
him
with
flatteries
why
did
you
turn
your
back
on
society
when
you
would
have
been
so
well
received
asked
the
marquise
every
one
was
prepared
to
make
much
of
you
and
i
have
a
quarrel
with
you
too
you
owed
me
a
call
i
am
still
waiting
to
receive
it
i
saw
you
at
the
opera
the
other
day
and
you
would
not
deign
to
come
to
see
me
nor
to
take
any
notice
of
me
your
cousin
madame
so
unmistakably
dismissed
me
oh
you
do
not
know
women
the
marquise
broke
in
upon
him
you
have
wounded
the
most
angelic
heart
the
noblest
nature
that
i
know
you
do
not
know
all
that
louise
was
trying
to
do
for
you
nor
how
tactfully
she
laid
her
plans
for
oh
and
she
would
have
succeeded
the
marquise
continued
replying
to
lucien
mute
incredulity
her
husband
is
dead
now
died
as
he
was
bound
to
die
of
an
indigestion
could
you
doubt
that
she
would
be
free
sooner
or
later
and
can
you
suppose
that
she
would
like
to
be
madame
chardon
it
was
worth
while
to
take
some
trouble
to
gain
the
title
of
comtesse
de
rubempre
love
you
see
is
a
great
vanity
which
requires
the
lesser
vanities
to
be
in
harmony
with
itself
especially
in
marriage
i
might
love
you
to
madness
which
is
to
say
sufficiently
to
marry
you
and
yet
i
should
find
it
very
unpleasant
to
be
called
madame
chardon
you
can
see
that
and
now
that
you
understand
the
difficulties
of
paris
life
you
will
know
how
many
roundabout
ways
you
must
take
to
reach
your
end
very
well
then
you
must
admit
that
louise
was
aspiring
to
an
all
but
impossible
piece
of
court
favor
she
was
quite
unknown
she
is
not
rich
and
therefore
she
could
not
afford
to
neglect
any
means
of
success
you
are
clever
the
marquise
continued
but
we
women
when
we
love
are
cleverer
than
the
cleverest
man
my
cousin
tried
to
make
that
absurd
chatelet
useful
oh
she
broke
off
i
owe
not
a
little
amusement
to
you
your
articles
on
chatelet
made
me
laugh
heartily
lucien
knew
not
what
to
think
of
all
this
of
the
treachery
and
bad
faith
of
journalism
he
had
had
some
experience
but
in
spite
of
his
perspicacity
he
scarcely
expected
to
find
bad
faith
or
treachery
in
society
there
were
some
sharp
lessons
in
store
for
him
but
madame
he
objected
for
her
words
aroused
a
lively
curiosity
is
not
the
heron
under
your
protection
one
is
obliged
to
be
civil
to
one
worst
enemies
in
society
protested
she
one
may
be
bored
but
one
must
look
as
if
the
talk
was
amusing
and
not
seldom
one
seems
to
sacrifice
friends
the
better
to
serve
them
are
you
still
a
novice
you
mean
to
write
and
yet
you
know
nothing
of
current
deceit
my
cousin
apparently
sacrificed
you
to
the
heron
but
how
could
she
dispense
with
his
influence
for
you
our
friend
stands
well
with
the
present
ministry
and
we
have
made
him
see
that
your
attacks
will
do
him
service
up
to
a
certain
point
for
we
want
you
to
make
it
up
again
some
of
these
days
chatelet
has
received
compensations
for
his
troubles
for
as
des
lupeaulx
said
the
newspapers
are
making
chatelet
ridiculous
they
will
leave
the
ministry
in
peace
there
was
a
pause
the
marquise
left
lucien
to
his
own
reflections
blondet
led
me
to
hope
that
i
should
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
in
my
house
said
the
comtesse
de
montcornet
you
will
meet
a
few
artists
and
men
of
letters
and
some
one
else
who
has
the
keenest
desire
to
become
acquainted
with
you
mlle
des
touches
the
owner
of
talents
rare
among
our
sex
you
will
go
to
her
house
no
doubt
mlle
de
touches
or
camille
maupin
if
you
prefer
it
is
prodigiously
rich
and
presides
over
one
of
the
most
remarkable
salons
in
paris
she
has
heard
that
you
are
as
handsome
as
you
are
clever
and
is
dying
to
meet
you
lucien
could
only
pour
out
incoherent
thanks
and
glance
enviously
at
emile
blondet
there
was
as
great
a
difference
between
a
great
lady
like
mme
de
montcornet
and
coralie
as
between
coralie
and
a
girl
out
of
the
streets
the
countess
was
young
and
witty
and
beautiful
with
the
very
white
fairness
of
women
of
the
north
her
mother
was
the
princess
scherbellof
and
the
minister
before
dinner
had
paid
her
the
most
respectful
attention
by
this
time
the
marquise
had
made
an
end
of
trifling
disdainfully
with
the
wing
of
a
chicken
my
poor
louise
felt
so
much
affection
for
you
she
said
she
took
me
into
her
confidence
i
knew
her
dreams
of
a
great
career
for
you
she
would
have
borne
a
great
deal
but
what
scorn
you
showed
her
when
you
sent
back
her
letters
cruelty
we
can
forgive
those
who
hurt
us
must
have
still
some
faith
in
us
but
indifference
indifference
is
like
polar
snows
it
extinguishes
all
life
so
you
must
see
that
you
have
lost
a
precious
affection
through
your
own
fault
why
break
with
her
even
if
she
had
scorned
you
you
had
your
way
to
make
had
you
not
your
name
to
win
back
louise
thought
of
all
that
then
why
was
she
silent
mon
dieu
cried
the
marquise
it
was
i
myself
who
advised
her
not
to
take
you
into
her
confidence
between
ourselves
you
know
you
seemed
so
little
used
to
the
ways
of
the
world
that
i
took
alarm
i
was
afraid
that
your
inexperience
and
rash
ardor
might
wreck
our
schemes
can
you
recollect
yourself
as
you
were
then
you
must
admit
that
if
you
could
see
your
double
you
would
say
the
same
yourself
you
are
not
like
the
same
man
that
was
our
mistake
but
would
one
man
in
a
thousand
combine
such
intellectual
gifts
with
such
wonderful
aptitude
for
taking
the
tone
of
society
i
did
not
think
that
you
would
be
such
an
astonishing
exception
you
were
transformed
so
quickly
you
acquired
the
manner
of
paris
so
easily
that
i
did
not
recognize
you
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
a
month
ago
lucien
heard
the
great
lady
with
inexpressible
pleasure
the
flatteries
were
spoken
with
such
a
petulant
childlike
confiding
air
and
she
seemed
to
take
such
a
deep
interest
in
him
that
he
thought
of
his
first
evening
at
the
and
began
to
fancy
that
some
such
miracle
was
about
to
take
place
a
second
time
everything
had
smiled
upon
him
since
that
happy
evening
his
youth
he
thought
was
the
talisman
that
worked
this
change
he
would
prove
this
great
lady
she
should
not
take
him
unawares
then
what
were
these
schemes
which
have
turned
to
chimeras
madame
asked
he
louise
meant
to
obtain
a
royal
patent
permitting
you
to
bear
the
name
and
title
of
rubempre
she
wished
to
put
chardon
out
of
sight
your
opinions
have
put
that
out
of
the
question
now
but
it
would
not
have
been
so
hard
to
manage
and
a
title
would
mean
a
fortune
for
you
you
will
look
on
these
things
as
trifles
and
visionary
ideas
she
continued
but
we
know
something
of
life
and
we
know
too
all
the
solid
advantages
of
a
count
title
when
it
is
borne
by
a
fashionable
and
extremely
charming
young
man
announce
chardon
and
le
comte
de
rubempre
before
heiresses
or
english
girls
with
a
million
to
their
fortune
and
note
the
difference
of
the
effect
the
count
might
be
in
debt
but
he
would
find
open
hearts
his
good
looks
brought
into
relief
by
his
title
would
be
like
a
diamond
in
a
rich
setting
chardon
would
not
be
so
much
as
noticed
we
have
not
invented
these
notions
they
are
everywhere
in
the
world
even
among
the
burgeois
you
are
turning
your
back
on
fortune
at
this
minute
do
you
see
that
young
man
he
is
the
vicomte
felix
de
vandenesse
one
of
the
king
private
secretaries
the
king
is
fond
enough
of
young
men
of
talent
and
vandenesse
came
from
the
provinces
with
baggage
nearly
as
light
as
yours
you
are
a
thousand
times
cleverer
than
he
but
do
you
belong
to
a
great
family
have
you
a
name
you
know
des
lupeaulx
his
name
is
very
much
like
yours
for
he
was
born
a
chardin
well
he
would
not
sell
his
little
farm
of
lupeaulx
for
a
million
he
will
be
comte
des
lupeaulx
some
day
and
perhaps
his
grandson
may
be
a
duke
you
have
made
a
false
start
and
if
you
continue
in
that
way
it
will
be
all
over
with
you
see
how
much
wiser
emile
blondet
has
been
he
is
engaged
on
a
government
newspaper
he
is
well
looked
on
by
those
in
authority
he
can
afford
to
mix
with
liberals
for
he
holds
sound
opinions
and
soon
or
later
he
will
succeed
but
then
he
understood
how
to
choose
his
opinions
and
his
protectors
your
charming
neighbor
mme
glanced
at
mme
de
montcornet
was
a
troisville
there
are
two
peers
of
france
in
the
family
and
two
deputies
she
made
a
wealthy
marriage
with
her
name
she
sees
a
great
deal
of
society
at
her
house
she
has
influence
she
will
move
the
political
world
for
young
blondet
where
will
a
coralie
take
you
in
a
few
years
time
you
will
be
hopelessly
in
debt
and
weary
of
pleasure
you
have
chosen
badly
in
love
and
you
are
arranging
your
life
ill
the
woman
whom
you
delight
to
wound
was
at
the
opera
the
other
night
and
this
was
how
she
spoke
of
you
she
deplored
the
way
in
which
you
were
throwing
away
your
talent
and
the
prime
of
youth
she
was
thinking
of
you
and
not
of
herself
all
the
while
ah
if
you
were
only
telling
me
the
truth
madame
cried
lucien
what
object
should
i
have
in
telling
lies
returned
the
marquise
with
a
glance
of
cold
disdain
which
annihilated
him
he
was
so
dashed
by
it
that
the
conversation
dropped
for
the
marquise
was
offended
and
said
no
more
lucien
was
nettled
by
her
silence
but
he
felt
that
it
was
due
to
his
own
clumsiness
and
promised
himself
that
he
would
repair
his
error
he
turned
to
mme
de
montcornet
and
talked
to
her
of
blondet
extolling
that
young
writer
for
her
benefit
the
countess
was
gracious
to
him
and
asked
him
at
a
sign
from
mme
to
spend
an
evening
at
her
house
it
was
to
be
a
small
and
quiet
gathering
to
which
only
friends
were
invited
mme
de
bargeton
would
be
there
in
spite
of
her
mourning
lucien
would
be
pleased
she
was
sure
to
meet
mme
de
bargeton
mme
la
marquise
says
that
all
the
wrong
is
on
my
side
said
lucien
so
surely
it
rests
with
her
cousin
does
it
not
to
decide
whether
she
will
meet
me
put
an
end
to
those
ridiculous
attacks
which
only
couple
her
name
with
the
name
of
a
man
for
whom
she
does
not
care
at
all
and
you
will
soon
sign
a
treaty
of
peace
you
thought
that
she
had
used
you
ill
i
am
told
but
i
myself
have
seen
her
in
sadness
because
you
had
forsaken
her
is
it
true
that
she
left
the
provinces
on
your
account
lucien
smiled
he
did
not
venture
to
make
any
other
reply
oh
how
could
you
doubt
the
woman
who
made
such
sacrifices
for
you
beautiful
and
intellectual
as
she
is
she
deserves
besides
to
be
loved
for
her
own
sake
and
mme
de
bargeton
cared
less
for
you
than
for
your
talents
believe
me
women
value
intellect
more
than
good
looks
added
the
countess
stealing
a
glance
at
emile
blondet
in
the
minister
hotel
lucien
could
see
the
differences
between
the
great
world
and
that
other
world
beyond
the
pale
in
which
he
had
lately
been
living
there
was
no
sort
of
resemblance
between
the
two
kinds
of
splendor
no
single
point
in
common
the
loftiness
and
disposition
of
the
rooms
in
one
of
the
handsomest
houses
in
the
faubourg
the
ancient
gilding
the
breadth
of
decorative
style
the
subdued
richness
of
the
accessories
all
this
was
strange
and
new
to
him
but
lucien
had
learned
very
quickly
to
take
luxury
for
granted
and
he
showed
no
surprise
his
behavior
was
as
far
removed
from
assurance
or
fatuity
on
the
one
hand
as
from
complacency
and
servility
upon
the
other
his
manner
was
good
he
found
favor
in
the
eyes
of
all
who
were
not
prepared
to
be
hostile
like
the
younger
men
who
resented
his
sudden
intrusion
into
the
great
world
and
felt
jealous
of
his
good
looks
and
his
success
when
they
rose
from
table
he
offered
his
arm
to
mme
and
was
not
refused
rastignac
watching
him
saw
that
the
marquise
was
gracious
to
lucien
and
came
in
the
character
of
a
to
remind
the
poet
that
they
had
met
once
before
at
mme
du
the
young
patrician
seemed
anxious
to
find
an
ally
in
the
great
man
from
his
own
province
asked
lucien
to
breakfast
with
him
some
morning
and
offered
to
introduce
him
to
some
young
men
of
fashion
lucien
was
nothing
loath
the
dear
blondet
is
coming
said
rastignac
the
two
were
standing
near
the
marquis
de
ronquerolles
the
duc
de
rhetore
de
marsay
and
general
montriveau
the
minister
came
across
to
join
the
group
well
said
he
addressing
lucien
with
a
bluff
german
heartiness
that
concealed
his
dangerous
subtlety
well
so
you
have
made
your
peace
with
mme
she
is
delighted
with
you
and
we
all
know
he
added
looking
round
the
group
how
difficult
it
is
to
please
her
yes
but
she
adores
intellect
said
rastignac
and
my
illustrious
has
wit
enough
to
sell
he
will
soon
find
out
that
he
is
not
doing
well
for
himself
blondet
put
in
briskly
he
will
come
over
he
will
soon
be
one
of
us
those
who
stood
about
lucien
rang
the
changes
on
this
theme
the
older
and
responsible
men
laid
down
the
law
with
one
or
two
profound
remarks
the
younger
ones
made
merry
at
the
expense
of
the
liberals
he
simply
tossed
up
head
or
tails
for
right
or
left
i
am
sure
remarked
blondet
but
now
he
will
choose
for
himself
lucien
burst
out
laughing
he
thought
of
his
talk
with
lousteau
that
evening
in
the
luxembourg
gardens
he
has
taken
on
a
continued
blondet
one
etienne
lousteau
a
newspaper
hack
who
sees
a
piece
in
a
column
lousteau
politics
consist
in
a
belief
that
napoleon
will
return
and
and
this
seems
to
me
to
be
still
more
simple
in
a
confidence
in
the
gratitude
and
patriotism
of
their
worships
the
gentlemen
of
the
left
as
a
rubempre
lucien
sympathies
should
lean
towards
the
aristocracy
as
a
journalist
he
ought
to
be
for
authority
or
he
will
never
be
either
rubempre
or
a
the
minister
now
asked
lucien
to
take
a
hand
at
whist
but
to
the
great
astonishment
of
those
present
he
declared
that
he
did
not
know
the
game
come
early
to
me
on
the
day
of
that
breakfast
affair
rastignac
whispered
and
i
will
teach
you
to
play
you
are
a
discredit
to
the
royal
city
of
angouleme
and
to
repeat
de
talleyrand
saying
you
are
laying
up
an
unhappy
old
age
for
yourself
des
lupeaulx
was
announced
he
remembered
lucien
whom
he
had
met
at
mme
du
and
bowed
with
a
semblance
of
friendliness
which
the
poet
could
not
doubt
des
lupeaulx
was
in
favor
he
was
a
master
of
requests
and
did
the
ministry
secret
services
he
was
moreover
cunning
and
ambitious
slipping
himself
in
everywhere
he
was
everybody
friend
for
he
never
knew
whom
he
might
need
he
saw
plainly
that
this
was
a
young
journalist
whose
social
success
would
probably
equal
his
success
in
literature
saw
too
that
the
poet
was
ambitious
and
overwhelmed
him
with
protestations
and
expressions
of
friendship
and
interest
till
lucien
felt
as
if
they
were
old
friends
already
and
took
his
promises
and
speeches
for
more
than
their
worth
des
lupeaulx
made
a
point
of
knowing
a
man
thoroughly
well
if
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
him
or
feared
him
as
a
rival
so
to
all
appearance
lucien
was
well
received
he
knew
that
much
of
his
success
was
owing
to
the
duc
de
rhetore
the
minister
mme
and
mme
de
montcornet
and
went
to
spend
a
few
moments
with
the
two
ladies
before
taking
leave
and
talked
his
very
best
for
them
what
a
coxcomb
said
des
lupeaulx
turning
to
the
marquise
when
he
had
gone
he
will
be
rotten
before
he
is
ripe
de
marsay
added
smiling
you
must
have
private
reasons
of
your
own
madame
for
turning
his
head
in
this
way
when
lucien
stepped
into
the
carriage
in
the
courtyard
he
found
coralie
waiting
for
him
she
had
come
to
fetch
him
the
little
attention
touched
him
he
told
her
the
history
of
his
evening
and
to
his
no
small
astonishment
the
new
notions
which
even
now
were
running
in
his
head
met
with
coralie
approval
she
strongly
advised
him
to
enlist
under
the
ministerial
banner
you
have
nothing
to
expect
from
the
liberals
but
hard
knocks
she
said
they
plot
and
conspire
they
murdered
the
duc
de
berri
will
they
upset
the
government
never
you
will
never
come
to
anything
through
them
while
you
will
be
comte
de
rubempre
if
you
throw
in
your
lot
with
the
other
side
you
might
render
services
to
the
state
and
be
a
peer
of
france
and
marry
an
heiress
be
an
ultra
it
is
the
proper
thing
besides
she
added
this
being
the
last
word
with
her
on
all
subjects
i
dined
with
the
she
told
me
that
theodore
gaillard
is
really
going
to
start
his
little
royalist
so
as
to
reply
to
your
witticisms
and
the
jokes
in
the
to
hear
them
talk
villele
party
will
be
in
office
before
the
year
is
out
try
to
turn
the
change
to
account
before
they
come
to
power
and
say
nothing
to
etienne
and
your
friends
for
they
are
quite
equal
to
playing
you
some
ill
turn
a
week
later
lucien
went
to
mme
de
montcornet
house
and
saw
the
woman
whom
he
had
so
loved
whom
later
he
had
stabbed
to
the
heart
with
a
jest
he
felt
the
most
violent
agitation
at
the
sight
of
her
for
louise
also
had
undergone
a
transformation
she
was
the
louise
that
she
would
always
have
been
but
for
her
detention
in
the
provinces
she
was
a
great
lady
there
was
a
grace
and
refinement
in
her
mourning
dress
which
told
that
she
was
a
happy
widow
lucien
fancied
that
this
coquetry
was
aimed
in
some
degree
at
him
and
he
was
right
but
like
an
ogre
he
had
tasted
flesh
and
all
that
evening
he
vacillated
between
coralie
warm
voluptuous
beauty
and
the
haughty
cruel
louise
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
sacrifice
the
actress
to
the
great
lady
and
mme
de
bargeton
all
the
old
feeling
reviving
in
her
at
the
sight
of
lucien
lucien
beauty
cleverness
was
waiting
and
expecting
that
sacrifice
all
evening
and
after
all
her
insinuating
speeches
and
her
fascinations
she
had
her
trouble
for
her
pains
she
left
the
room
with
a
fixed
determination
to
be
revenged
well
dear
lucien
she
had
said
and
in
her
kindness
there
was
both
generosity
and
parisian
grace
well
dear
lucien
so
you
that
were
to
have
been
my
pride
took
me
for
your
first
victim
and
i
forgave
you
my
dear
for
i
felt
that
in
such
a
revenge
there
was
a
trace
of
love
still
left
with
that
speech
and
the
queenly
way
in
which
it
was
uttered
mme
de
bargeton
recovered
her
position
lucien
convinced
that
he
was
a
thousand
times
in
the
right
felt
that
he
had
been
put
in
the
wrong
not
one
word
of
the
causes
of
the
rupture
not
one
syllable
of
the
terrible
farewell
letter
a
woman
of
the
world
has
a
wonderful
genius
for
diminishing
her
faults
by
laughing
at
them
she
can
obliterate
them
all
with
a
smile
or
a
question
of
feigned
surprise
and
she
knows
this
she
remembers
nothing
she
can
explain
everything
she
is
amazed
asks
questions
comments
amplifies
and
quarrels
with
you
till
in
the
end
her
sins
disappear
like
stains
on
the
application
of
a
little
soap
and
water
black
as
ink
you
knew
them
to
be
and
lo
in
a
moment
you
behold
immaculate
white
innocence
and
lucky
are
you
if
you
do
not
find
that
you
yourself
have
sinned
in
some
way
beyond
redemption
in
a
moment
old
illusions
regained
their
power
over
lucien
and
louise
they
talked
like
friends
as
before
but
when
the
lady
with
a
hesitating
sigh
put
the
question
are
you
happy
lucien
was
not
ready
with
a
prompt
decided
answer
he
was
intoxicated
with
gratified
vanity
coralie
who
let
us
admit
it
had
made
life
easy
for
him
had
turned
his
head
a
melancholy
no
would
have
made
his
fortune
but
he
must
needs
begin
to
explain
his
position
with
regard
to
coralie
he
said
that
he
was
loved
for
his
own
sake
he
said
a
good
many
foolish
things
that
a
man
will
say
when
he
is
smitten
with
a
tender
passion
and
thought
the
while
that
he
was
doing
a
clever
thing
mme
de
bargeton
bit
her
lips
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
mme
brought
mme
de
montcornet
to
her
cousin
and
lucien
became
the
hero
of
the
evening
so
to
speak
he
was
flattered
petted
and
made
much
of
by
the
three
women
he
was
entangled
with
art
which
no
words
can
describe
his
social
success
in
this
fine
and
brilliant

as
great
as

him
to
one
of
her
wednesday
dinners
his
beauty
now
so
justly
famous
seemed
to
have
made
an
impression
upon
her
lucien
exerted
himself
to
show
that
his
wit
equaled
his
good
looks
and
mlle
des

expressed
her
admiration
with
a
playful
outspokenness
and
a
pretty
fervor
of
friendship
which
deceives
those
who
do
not
know
life
in
paris
to
its
depths
nor
suspect
how
continual
enjoyment
whets
the
appetite
for
novelty
if
she
should
like

as
much
as
i
like
her
we
might
abridge

lucien
addressing

too
well

them

it

not

the
charming
young

thirty
years

is
a
silly
little
fool
my
dear
boy
well
enough
for
a
start
for
a
young
spark
must
have
a
mistress
but
unless
you
make
some
great
conquest
in

great

an

will
do
you
harm

he
told

carried

off
to

they

speak
to
the
chancellor
for
you
the
diplomatist
and
the
two
women
had
very
soon
discovered
weak
side
the
poet
head
was
turned
by
the
glory
of
the
aristocracy
every
man
who
entered
the
rooms
bore
a
sounding
name
mounted
in
a
glittering
title
and
he
himself
was
plain
chardon
unspeakable
mortification
filled
him
at
the
sound
of
it
wherever
he
had
been
during
the
last
few
days
that
pang
had
been
constantly
present
with
him
he
felt
moreover
a
sensation
quite
as
unpleasant
when
he
went
back
to
his
desk
after
an
evening
spent
in
the
great
world
in
which
he
made
a
tolerable
figure
thanks
to
coralie
carriage
and
servants
he
learned
to
ride
in
order
to
escort
mme
mlle
des
touches
and
the
comtesse
de
montcornet
when
they
drove
in
the
bois
a
privilege
which
he
had
envied
other
young
men
so
greatly
when
he
first
came
to
paris
finot
was
delighted
to
give
his
man
an
order
for
the
opera
so
lucien
wasted
many
an
evening
there
and
thenceforward
he
was
among
the
exquisites
of
the
day
the
poet
asked
rastignac
and
his
new
associates
to
a
breakfast
and
made
the
blunder
of
giving
it
in
coralie
rooms
in
the
rue
de
vendome
he
was
too
young
too
much
of
a
poet
too
to
discern
certain
shades
and
distinctions
in
conduct
and
how
should
an
actress
a
but
uneducated
girl
teach
him
life
his
guests
were
anything
but
charitably
disposed
towards
him
it
was
clearly
proven
to
their
minds
that
lucien
the
critic
and
the
actress
were
in
collusion
for
their
mutual
interests
and
all
of
the
young
men
were
jealous
of
an
arrangement
which
all
of
them
stigmatized
the
most
pitiless
of
those
who
laughed
that
evening
at
lucien
expense
was
rastignac
himself
rastignac
had
made
and
held
his
position
by
very
similar
means
but
so
careful
had
he
been
of
appearances
that
he
could
afford
to
treat
scandal
as
slander
lucien
proved
an
apt
pupil
at
whist
play
became
a
passion
with
him
and
so
far
from
disapproving
coralie
encouraged
his
extravagance
with
the
peculiar
of
an
love
which
sees
nothing
beyond
the
moment
and
is
ready
to
sacrifice
anything
even
the
future
to
the
present
enjoyment
coralie
looked
on
cards
as
a
against
rivals
a
great
love
has
much
in
common
with
childhood
a
child
heedless
careless
spendthrift
ways
a
laughter
and
tears
in
those
days
there
lived
and
flourished
a
set
of
young
men
some
of
them
rich
some
poor
and
all
of
them
idle
called
and
indeed
they
lived
with
incredible
insolence
unabashed
and
unproductive
consumers
and
yet
more
intrepid
drinkers
these
spendthrifts
mingled
the
roughest
practical
jokes
with
a
life
not
so
much
reckless
as
suicidal
they
drew
back
from
no
impossibility
and
gloried
in
pranks
which
nevertheless
were
confined
within
certain
limits
and
as
they
showed
the
most
original
wit
in
their
escapades
it
was
impossible
not
to
pardon
them
no
sign
of
the
times
more
plainly
discovered
the
helotism
to
which
the
restoration
had
condemned
the
young
manhood
of
the
epoch
the
younger
men
being
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
do
with
themselves
were
compelled
to
find
other
outlets
for
their
superabundant
energy
besides
journalism
or
conspiracy
or
art
or
letters
they
squandered
their
strength
in
the
wildest
excesses
such
sap
and
luxuriant
power
was
there
in
young
france
the
hard
workers
among
these
gilded
youths
wanted
power
and
pleasure
the
artists
wished
for
money
the
idle
sought
to
stimulate
their
appetites
or
wished
for
excitement
one
and
all
of
them
wanted
a
place
and
one
and
all
were
shut
out
from
politics
and
public
life
nearly
all
the
were
men
of
unusual
mental
powers
some
held
out
against
the
enervating
life
others
were
ruined
by
it
the
most
celebrated
and
the
cleverest
among
them
was
eugene
rastignac
who
entered
with
de
marsay
help
upon
a
political
career
in
which
he
has
since
distinguished
himself
the
practical
jokes
in
which
the
set
indulged
became
so
famous
that
not
a
few
vaudevilles
have
been
founded
upon
them
blondet
introduced
lucien
to
this
society
of
prodigals
of
which
he
became
a
brilliant
ornament
ranking
next
to
bixiou
one
of
the
most
mischievous
and
untiring
scoffing
wits
of
his
time
all
through
that
winter
lucien
life
was
one
long
fit
of
intoxication
with
intervals
of
easy
work
he
continued
his
series
of
sketches
of
contemporary
life
and
very
occasionally
made
great
efforts
to
write
a
few
pages
of
serious
criticism
on
which
he
brought
his
utmost
power
of
thought
to
bear
but
study
was
the
exception
not
the
rule
and
only
undertaken
at
the
bidding
of
necessity
dinners
and
breakfasts
parties
of
pleasure
and
play
took
up
most
of
his
time
and
coralie
absorbed
all
that
was
left
he
would
not
think
of
the
morrow
he
saw
besides
that
his
friends
were
leading
the
same
life
earning
money
easily
by
writing
publishers
prospectuses
and
articles
paid
for
by
speculators
all
of
them
lived
beyond
their
incomes
none
of
them
thought
seriously
of
the
future
lucien
had
been
admitted
into
the
ranks
of
journalism
and
of
literature
on
terms
of
equality
he
foresaw
immense
difficulties
in
the
way
if
he
should
try
to
rise
above
the
rest
every
one
was
willing
to
look
upon
him
as
an
equal
no
one
would
have
him
for
a
superior
unconsciously
he
gave
up
the
idea
of
winning
fame
in
literature
for
it
seemed
easier
to
gain
success
in
politics
intrigue
raises
less
opposition
than
talent
du
chatelet
had
said
one
day
for
lucien
and
the
baron
had
made
up
their
quarrel
a
plot
below
the
surface
rouses
no
one
attention
intrigue
moreover
is
superior
to
talent
for
it
makes
something
out
of
nothing
while
for
the
most
part
the
immense
resources
of
talent
only
injure
a
man
so
lucien
never
lost
sight
of
his
principal
idea
and
though
following
close
upon
the
heels
of
in
the
midst
of
an
orgy
never
found
the
promised
work
accomplished
lucien
was
assiduous
in
society
he
paid
court
to
mme
de
bargeton
the
marquise
and
the
comtesse
de
montcornet
he
never
missed
a
single
party
given
by
mlle
des
touches
appearing
in
society
after
a
dinner
given
by
authors
or
publishers
and
leaving
the
salons
for
a
supper
given
in
consequence
of
a
bet
the
demands
of
conversation
and
the
excitement
of
play
absorbed
all
the
ideas
and
energy
left
by
excess
the
poet
had
lost
the
lucidity
of
judgment
and
coolness
of
head
which
must
be
preserved
if
a
man
is
to
see
all
that
is
going
on
around
him
and
never
to
lose
the
exquisite
tact
which
the
needs
at
every
moment
how
should
he
know
how
many
a
time
mme
de
bargeton
left
him
with
wounded
susceptibilities
how
often
she
forgave
him
or
added
one
more
condemnation
to
the
rest
chatelet
saw
that
his
rival
had
still
a
chance
left
so
he
became
lucien
friend
he
encouraged
the
poet
in
dissipation
that
wasted
his
energies
rastignac
jealous
of
his
and
thinking
besides
that
chatelet
would
be
a
surer
and
more
useful
ally
than
lucien
had
taken
up
the
baron
cause
so
some
few
days
after
the
meeting
of
the
petrarch
and
laura
of
angouleme
rastignac
brought
about
the
reconciliation
between
the
poet
and
the
elderly
beau
at
a
sumptuous
supper
given
at
the
de
lucien
never
returned
home
till
morning
and
rose
in
the
middle
of
the
day
coralie
was
always
at
his
side
he
could
not
forego
a
single
pleasure
sometimes
he
saw
his
real
position
and
made
good
resolutions
but
they
came
to
nothing
in
his
idle
easy
life
and
the
mainspring
of
will
grew
slack
and
only
responded
to
the
heaviest
pressure
of
necessity
coralie
had
been
glad
that
lucien
should
amuse
himself
she
had
encouraged
him
in
this
reckless
expenditure
because
she
thought
that
the
cravings
which
she
fostered
would
bind
her
lover
to
her
but
and
loving
as
she
was
she
found
courage
to
advise
lucien
not
to
forget
his
work
and
once
or
twice
was
obliged
to
remind
him
that
he
had
earned
very
little
during
the
month
their
debts
were
growing
frightfully
fast
the
fifteen
hundred
francs
which
remained
from
the
of
the
had
been
swallowed
up
at
once
together
with
lucien
first
five
hundred
livres
in
three
months
he
had
only
made
a
thousand
francs
yet
he
felt
as
though
he
had
been
working
tremendously
hard
but
by
this
time
lucien
had
adopted
the
pleasant
theory
of
debts
debts
are
becoming
to
a
young
man
but
after
the
age
of
they
are
inexcusable
it
should
be
observed
that
there
are
certain
natures
in
which
a
really
poetic
temper
is
united
with
a
weakened
will
and
these
while
absorbed
in
feeling
that
they
may
transmute
personal
experience
sensation
or
impression
into
some
permanent
form
are
essentially
deficient
in
the
moral
sense
which
should
accompany
all
observation
poets
prefer
rather
to
receive
their
own
impressions
than
to
enter
into
the
souls
of
others
to
study
the
mechanism
of
their
feelings
and
thoughts
so
lucien
neither
asked
his
associates
what
became
of
those
who
disappeared
from
among
them
nor
looked
into
the
futures
of
his
friends
some
of
them
were
heirs
to
property
others
had
definite
expectations
yet
others
either
possessed
names
that
were
known
in
the
world
or
a
most
robust
belief
in
their
destiny
and
a
fixed
resolution
to
circumvent
the
law
lucien
too
believed
in
his
future
on
the
strength
of
various
profound
axiomatic
sayings
of
blondet
everything
comes
out
all
right
at
last
if
a
man
has
nothing
his
affairs
can
not
be
embarrassed
we
have
nothing
to
lose
but
the
fortune
that
we
seek
swim
with
the
stream
it
will
take
you
somewhere
a
clever
man
with
a
footing
in
society
can
make
a
fortune
whenever
he
pleases
that
winter
filled
as
it
was
with
so
many
pleasures
and
dissipations
was
a
necessary
interval
employed
in
finding
capital
for
the
new
royalist
paper
theodore
gaillard
and
hector
merlin
only
brought
out
the
first
number
of
the
in

the
affair
had
been
settled
at
mme

mme

exercised
a
certain
influence
over
the
great
personages
royalist
writers
and
bankers
who
met
in
her
splendid
rooms
fit
for
a
tale
out
of
the
as
the
elegant
and
clever
courtesan
herself
used
to
say
to
transact
business
which
could
not
be
arranged
elsewhere
the
editorship
had
been
promised
to
hector
merlin
lucien
intimate
was
pretty
certain
to
be
his
man
and
a
in
a
ministerial
paper
had
been
promised
to
him
besides
all
through
the
dissipations
of
that
winter
lucien
had
been
secretly
making
ready
for
this
change
of
front
child
as
he
was
he
fancied
that
he
was
a
deep
politician
because
he
concealed
the
preparation
for
the
approaching
while
he
was
counting
upon
ministerial
largesses
to
extricate
himself
from
embarrassment
and
to
lighten
coralie
secret
cares
coralie
said
nothing
of
her
distress
she
smiled
now
as
always
but
berenice
was
bolder
she
kept
lucien
informed
of
their
difficulties
and
the
budding
great
man
moved
after
the
fashion
of
poets
by
the
tale
of
disasters
would
vow
that
he
would
begin
to
work
in
earnest
and
then
forget
his
resolution
and
drown
his
fleeting
cares
in
excess
one
day
coralie
saw
the
poetic
brow
overcast
and
scolded
berenice
and
told
her
lover
that
everything
would
be
settled
mme
and
mme
de
bargeton
were
waiting
for
profession
of
his
new
creed
so
they
said
before
applying
through
chatelet
for
the
patent
which
should
permit
lucien
to
bear
the
desired
name
lucien
had
proposed
to
dedicate
the
to
mme
and
the
marquise
seemed
to
be
not
a
little
flattered
by
a
compliment
which
authors
have
been
somewhat
chary
of
paying
since
they
became
a
power
in
the
land
but
when
lucien
went
to
dauriat
and
asked
after
his
book
that
worthy
publisher
met
him
with
excellent
reasons
for
the
delay
in
its
appearance
dauriat
had
this
and
that
in
hand
which
took
up
all
his
time
a
new
volume
by
canalis
was
coming
out
and
he
did
not
want
the
two
books
to
clash
de
lamartine
second
series
of
was
in
the
press
and
two
important
collections
of
poetry
ought
not
to
appear
together
by
this
time
however
lucien
needs
were
so
pressing
that
he
had
recourse
to
finot
and
received
an
advance
on
his
work
when
at
a
that
evening
the
poet
journalist
explained
his
position
to
his
friends
in
the
fast
set
they
drowned
his
scruples
in
champagne
iced
with
pleasantries
debts
there
was
never
yet
a
man
of
any
power
without
debts
debts
represented
satisfied
cravings
clamorous
vices
a
man
only
succeeds
under
the
pressure
of
the
iron
hand
of
necessity
debts
forsooth
why
the
one
pledge
of
which
a
great
man
can
be
sure
is
given
him
by
his
friend
the
pawnbroker
cried
blondet
if
you
want
everything
you
must
owe
for
everything
called
bixiou
no
corrected
des
lupeaulx
if
you
owe
for
everything
you
have
had
everything
the
party
contrived
to
convince
the
novice
that
his
debts
were
a
golden
spur
to
urge
on
the
horses
of
the
chariot
of
his
fortunes
there
is
always
the
stock
example
of
julius
caesar
with
his
debt
of
forty
millions
and
friedrich
ii
on
an
allowance
of
one
ducat
a
month
and
a
host
of
other
great
men
whose
failings
are
held
up
for
the
corruption
of
youth
while
not
a
word
is
said
of
their
ideas
their
courage
equal
to
all
odds
creditors
seized
coralie
horses
carriage
and
furniture
at
last
for
an
amount
of
four
thousand
francs
lucien
went
to
lousteau
and
asked
his
friend
to
meet
his
bill
for
the
thousand
francs
lent
to
pay
gaming
debts
but
lousteau
showed
him
certain
pieces
of
stamped
paper
which
proved
that
florine
was
in
much
the
same
case
lousteau
was
grateful
however
and
offered
to
take
the
necessary
steps
for
the
sale
of
lucien
of
charles
how
came
florine
to
be
in
this
plight
asked
lucien
the
matifat
took
alarm
said
lousteau
we
have
lost
him
but
if
florine
chooses
she
can
make
him
pay
dear
for
his
treachery
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
three
days
after
this
bootless
errand
lucien
and
coralie
were
breakfasting
in
melancholy
spirits
beside
the
fire
in
their
pretty
bedroom
berenice
had
cooked
a
dish
of
eggs
for
them
over
the
grate
for
the
cook
had
gone
and
the
coachman
and
servants
had
taken
leave
they
could
not
sell
the
furniture
for
it
had
been
attached
there
was
not
a
single
object
of
any
value
in
the
house
a
goodly
collection
of
pawntickets
forming
a
very
instructive
octavo
volume
represented
all
the
gold
silver
and
jewelry
berenice
had
kept
back
a
couple
of
spoons
and
forks
that
was
all
lousteau
newspaper
was
of
service
now
to
coralie
and
lucien
little
as
they
suspected
it
for
the
tailor
dressmaker
and
milliner
were
afraid
to
meddle
with
a
journalist
who
was
quite
capable
of
writing
down
their
establishments
etienne
lousteau
broke
in
upon
their
breakfast
with
a
shout
of
hurrah
long
live
archer
of
charles
and
i
have
converted
a
hundred
francs
worth
of
books
into
cash
children
we
will
go
halves
he
handed
fifty
francs
to
coralie
and
sent
berenice
out
in
quest
of
a
more
substantial
breakfast
hector
merlin
and
i
went
to
a
booksellers
trade
dinner
yesterday
and
prepared
the
way
for
your
romance
with
cunning
insinuations
dauriat
is
in
treaty
but
dauriat
is
haggling
over
it
he
wo
give
more
than
four
thousand
francs
for
two
thousand
copies
and
you
want
six
thousand
francs
we
made
you
out
twice
as
great
as
sir
walter
scott
oh
you
have
such
novels
as
never
were
in
the
inwards
of
you
it
is
not
a
mere
book
for
sale
it
is
a
big
business
you
are
not
simply
the
writer
of
one
more
or
less
ingenious
novel
you
are
going
to
write
a
whole
series
the
word
did
it
so
mind
you
forget
that
you
have
a
great
historical
series
on
hand
grande
or
france
of
louis
or
early
days
of
louis
queen
and
the
or
and
the
son
of
the
or
these
novels
will
be
announced
on
the
wrapper
of
the
book
we
call
this
manoeuvre
a
success
a
toss
in
the
coverlet
for
the
titles
are
all
to
appear
on
the
cover
till
you
will
be
better
known
for
the
books
that
you
have
not
written
than
for
the
work
you
have
done
and
the
press
is
a
way
of
gaining
credit
in
advance
for
work
that
you
will
do
come
now
let
us
have
a
little
fun
here
comes
the
champagne
you
can
understand
lucien
that
our
men
opened
eyes
as
big
as
saucers
by
the
by
i
see
that
you
have
saucers
still
left
they
are
attached
explained
coralie
i
understand
and
i
resume
show
a
publisher
one
manuscript
volume
and
he
will
believe
in
all
the
rest
a
publisher
asks
to
see
your
manuscript
and
gives
you
to
understand
that
he
is
going
to
read
it
why
disturb
his
harmless
vanity
they
never
read
a
manuscript
they
would
not
publish
so
many
if
they
did
well
hector
and
i
allowed
it
to
leak
out
that
you
might
consider
an
offer
of
five
thousand
francs
for
three
thousand
copies
in
two
editions
let
me
have
your
the
day
after
we
are
to
breakfast
with
the
publishers
and
we
will
get
the
upper
hand
of
them
who
are
they
asked
lucien
two
partners
named
fendant
and
cavalier
they
are
two
good
fellows
pretty
straightforward
in
business
one
of
them
used
to
be
with
vidal
and
porchon
the
other
is
the
cleverest
hand
on
the
quai
des
augustins
they
only
started
in
business
last
year
and
have
lost
a
little
on
translations
of
english
novels
so
now
my
gentlemen
have
a
mind
to
exploit
the
native
product
there
is
a
rumor
current
that
those
dealers
in
spoiled
white
paper
are
trading
on
other
capital
but
i
do
think
it
matters
very
much
to
you
who
finds
the
money
so
long
as
you
are
paid
two
days
later
the
pair
went
to
a
breakfast
in
the
rue
serpente
in
lucien
old
quarter
of
paris
lousteau
still
kept
his
room
in
the
rue
de
la
harpe
and
it
was
in
the
same
state
as
before
but
this
time
lucien
felt
no
surprise
he
had
been
initiated
into
the
life
of
journalism
he
knew
all
its
ups
and
downs
since
that
evening
of
his
introduction
to
the
wooden
galleries
he
had
been
paid
for
many
an
article
and
gambled
away
the
money
along
with
the
desire
to
write
he
had
filled
columns
not
once
but
many
times
in
the
ingenious
ways
described
by
lousteau
on
that
memorable
evening
as
they
went
to
the
palais
royal
he
was
dependent
upon
barbet
and
braulard
he
trafficked
in
books
and
he
shrank
no
longer
from
any
attack
from
writing
any
panegyric
and
at
this
moment
he
was
in
some
sort
rejoicing
to
make
all
he
could
out
of
lousteau
before
turning
his
back
on
the
liberals
his
intimate
knowledge
of
the
party
would
stand
him
in
good
stead
in
future
and
lousteau
on
his
side
was
privately
receiving
five
hundred
francs
of
under
the
name
of
commission
from
fendant
and
cavalier
for
introducing
the
future
sir
walter
scott
to
two
enterprising
tradesmen
in
search
of
a
french
author
of
waverley
the
firm
of
fendant
and
cavalier
had
started
in
business
without
any
capital
whatsoever
a
great
many
publishing
houses
were
established
at
that
time
in
the
same
way
and
are
likely
to
be
established
so
long
as
papermakers
and
printers
will
give
credit
for
the
time
required
to
play
some
seven
or
eight
of
the
games
of
chance
called
new
publications
at
that
time
as
at
present
the
author
copyright
was
paid
for
in
bills
at
six
nine
and
twelve
months
a
method
of
payment
determined
by
the
custom
of
the
trade
for
booksellers
settle
accounts
between
themselves
by
bills
at
even
longer
dates
papermakers
and
printers
are
paid
in
the
same
way
so
that
in
practice
the
has
a
dozen
or
a
score
of
works
on
sale
for
a
twelvemonth
before
he
pays
for
them
even
if
only
two
or
three
of
these
hit
the
public
taste
the
profitable
speculations
pay
for
the
bad
and
the
publisher
pays
his
way
by
grafting
as
it
were
one
book
upon
another
but
if
all
of
them
turn
out
badly
or
if
for
his
misfortune
the
happens
to
bring
out
some
really
good
literature
which
stays
on
hand
until
the
right
public
discovers
and
appreciates
it
or
if
it
costs
too
much
to
discount
the
paper
that
he
receives
then
resignedly
he
files
his
schedule
and
becomes
a
bankrupt
with
an
untroubled
mind
he
was
prepared
all
along
for
something
of
the
kind
so
all
the
chances
being
in
favor
of
the
publishers
they
staked
other
people
money
not
their
own
upon
the
of
business
speculation
this
was
the
case
with
fendant
and
cavalier
cavalier
brought
his
experience
fendant
his
industry
the
capital
was
a
affair
and
very
accurately
described
by
that
word
for
it
consisted
in
a
few
thousand
francs
scraped
together
with
difficulty
by
the
mistresses
of
the
pair
out
of
this
fund
they
allowed
each
other
a
fairly
handsome
salary
and
scrupulously
spent
it
all
in
dinners
to
journalists
and
authors
or
at
the
theatre
where
their
business
was
transacted
as
they
said
this
questionably
honest
couple
were
both
supposed
to
be
clever
men
of
business
but
fendant
was
more
slippery
than
cavalier
cavalier
true
to
his
name
traveled
about
fendant
looked
after
business
in
paris
a
partnership
between
two
publishers
is
always
more
or
less
of
a
duel
and
so
it
was
with
fendant
and
cavalier
they
had
brought
out
plenty
of
romances
already
such
as
the
du
marchand
de
fontaine
du
and
translations
of
the
works
of
galt
an
english
novelist
who
never
attained
much
popularity
in
france
the
success
of
translations
of
scott
had
called
the
attention
of
the
trade
to
english
novels
the
race
of
publishers
all
agog
for
a
second
norman
conquest
were
seeking
industriously
for
a
second
scott
just
as
at
a
rather
later
day
every
one
must
needs
look
for
asphalt
in
stony
soil
or
bitumen
in
marshes
and
speculate
in
projected
railways
the
stupidity
of
the
paris
commercial
world
is
conspicuous
in
these
attempts
to
do
the
same
thing
twice
for
success
lies
in
contraries
and
in
paris
of
all
places
in
the
world
success
spoils
success
so
beneath
the
title
of
or
russia
a
hundred
years
fendant
and
cavalier
rashly
added
in
big
letters
the
words
in
the
style
of
scott
fendant
and
cavalier
were
in
great
need
of
a
success
a
single
good
book
might
float
their
sunken
bales
they
thought
and
there
was
the
alluring
prospect
besides
of
articles
in
the
newspapers
the
great
way
of
promoting
sales
in
those
days
a
book
is
very
seldom
bought
and
sold
for
its
just
value
and
purchases
are
determined
by
considerations
quite
other
than
the
merits
of
the
work
so
fendant
and
cavalier
thought
of
lucien
as
a
journalist
and
of
his
book
as
a
salable
article
which
would
help
them
to
tide
over
their
monthly
settlement
the
partners
occupied
the
ground
floor
of
one
of
the
great
houses
in
the
rue
serpente
their
private
office
had
been
contrived
at
the
further
end
of
a
suite
of
large
now
converted
into
warehouses
for
books
lucien
and
etienne
found
the
publishers
in
their
office
the
agreement
drawn
up
and
the
bills
ready
lucien
wondered
at
such
prompt
action
fendant
was
short
and
thin
and
by
no
means
reassuring
of
aspect
with
his
low
narrow
forehead
sunken
nose
and
hard
mouth
he
looked
like
a
kalmuck
tartar
a
pair
of
small
black
eyes
the
crabbed
irregular
outline
of
his
countenance
a
voice
like
a
cracked
bell
the
man
whole
appearance
in
fact
combined
to
give
the
impression
that
this
was
a
consummate
rascal
a
honeyed
tongue
compensated
for
these
disadvantages
and
he
gained
his
ends
by
talk
cavalier
a
stout
young
fellow
looked
more
like
the
driver
of
a
mail
coach
than
a
publisher
he
had
hair
of
a
sandy
color
a
fiery
red
countenance
and
the
heavy
build
and
untiring
tongue
of
a
commercial
traveler
there
is
no
need
to
discuss
this
affair
said
fendant
addressing
lucien
and
lousteau
i
have
read
the
work
it
is
very
literary
and
so
exactly
the
kind
of
thing
we
want
that
i
have
sent
it
off
as
it
is
to
the
printer
the
agreement
is
drawn
on
the
lines
laid
down
and
besides
we
always
make
the
same
stipulations
in
all
cases
the
bills
fall
due
in
six
nine
and
twelve
months
respectively
you
will
meet
with
no
difficulty
in
discounting
them
and
we
will
refund
you
the
discount
we
have
reserved
the
right
of
giving
a
new
title
to
the
book
we
do
care
for
archer
of
charles
it
does
tickle
the
reader
curiosity
sufficiently
there
were
several
kings
of
that
name
you
see
and
there
were
so
many
archers
in
the
middle
ages
if
you
had
only
called
it
the
of
now
but
archer
of
charles
why
cavalier
would
have
to
give
a
course
of
history
lessons
before
he
could
place
a
copy
anywhere
in
the
provinces
if
you
but
knew
the
class
of
people
that
we
have
to
do
with
exclaimed
cavalier
would
suit
better
continued
fendant
de
medici
or
france
under
charles
would
sound
more
like
one
of
scott
novels
added
cavalier
we
will
settle
it
when
the
work
is
printed
said
fendant
do
as
you
please
so
long
as
i
approve
your

said
lucien
the
agreement
was
read
over
signed
in
duplicate
and
each
of
the
contracting
parties
took
their
copy
lucien
put
the
bills
in
his
pocket
with
unequaled
satisfaction
and
the
four
repaired
to
abode
where
they
breakfasted
on
beefsteaks
and
oysters
kidneys
in
champagne
and
brie
cheese
but
if
the
fare
was
something
of
the
homeliest
the
wines
were
exquisite
cavalier
had
an
acquaintance
a
traveler
in
the
wine
trade
just
as
they
sat
down
to
table
the
printer
appeared
to
lucien
surprise
with
the
first
two
we
want
to
get
on
with
it
fendant
said
we
are
counting
on
your
book
we
want
a
success
confoundedly
badly
the
breakfast
begun
at
noon
lasted
till
five
where
shall
we
get
cash
for
these
things
asked
lucien
as
they
came
away
somewhat
heated
and
flushed
with
the
wine
we
might
try
barbet
suggested
etienne
and
they
turned
down
to
the
quai
des
augustins
coralie
is
astonished
to
the
highest
degree
over
florine
loss
florine
only
told
her
about
it
yesterday
she
seemed
to
lay
the
blame
of
it
on
you
and
was
so
vexed
that
she
was
ready
to
throw
you
over
that
true
said
lousteau
wine
had
got
the
better
of
prudence
and
he
unbosomed
himself
to
lucien
ending
up
with
my
friend
for
you
are
my
friend
lucien
you
lent
me
a
thousand
francs
and
you
have
only
once
asked
me
for
the
money
shun
play
if
i
had
never
touched
a
card
i
should
be
a
happy
man
i
owe
money
all
round
at
this
moment
i
have
the
bailiffs
at
my
heels
indeed
when
i
go
to
the
palais
royal
i
have
dangerous
capes
to
double
in
the
language
of
the
fast
set
doubling
a
cape
meant
dodging
a
creditor
or
keeping
out
of
his
way
lucien
had
not
heard
the
expression
before
but
he
was
familiar
with
the
practice
by
this
time
are
your
debts
so
heavy
a
mere
trifle
said
lousteau
a
thousand
crowns
would
pull
me
through
i
have
resolved
to
turn
steady
and
give
up
play
and
i
have
done
a
little
to
pay
my
debts
what
is
asked
lucien
it
is
an
english
invention
recently
imported
a
is
a
man
who
can
manage
to
put
a
paragraph
in
the
papers
never
an
editor
nor
a
responsible
man
for
they
are
not
supposed
to
know
anything
about
it
and
there
is
always
a
giroudeau
or
a
philippe
bridau
to
be
found
a
bravo
of
this
stamp
finds
up
somebody
who
has
his
own
reasons
for
not
wanting
to
be
talked
about
plenty
of
people
have
a
few
peccadilloes
or
some
more
or
less
original
sin
upon
their
consciences
there
are
plenty
of
fortunes
made
in
ways
that
would
not
bear
looking
into
sometimes
a
man
has
kept
the
letter
of
the
law
and
sometimes
he
has
not
and
in
either
case
there
is
a
tidbit
of
tattle
for
the
inquirer
as
for
instance
that
tale
of
fouche
police
surrounding
the
spies
of
the
prefect
of
police
who
not
being
in
the
secret
of
the
fabrication
of
forged
english
banknotes
were
just
about
to
pounce
on
the
clandestine
printers
employed
by
the
minister
or
there
is
the
story
of
prince
galathionne
diamonds
the
maubreuile
affair
or
the
pombreton
will
case
the
gets
possession
of
some
compromising
letter
asks
for
an
interview
and
if
the
man
that
made
the
money
does
not
buy
silence
the
draws
a
picture
of
the
press
ready
to
take
the
matter
up
and
unravel
his
private
affairs
the
rich
man
is
frightened
he
comes
down
with
the
money
and
the
trick
succeeds
you
are
committed
to
some
risky
venture
which
might
easily
be
written
down
in
a
series
of
articles
a
waits
upon
you
and
offers
to
withdraw
the
articles
for
a
consideration
are
sent
to
men
in
office
who
will
bargain
that
their
acts
and
not
their
private
characters
are
to
be
attacked
or
they
are
heedless
of
their
characters
and
anxious
only
to
shield
the
woman
they
love
one
of
your
acquaintance
that
charming
master
of
requests
des
lupeaulx
is
a
kind
of
agent
for
affairs
of
this
sort
the
rascal
has
made
a
position
for
himself
in
the
most
marvelous
way
in
the
very
centre
of
power
he
is
the
of
the
press
and
the
ambassador
of
the
ministers
he
works
upon
a
man
he
bribes
newspapers
to
pass
over
a
loan
in
silence
or
to
make
no
comment
on
a
contract
which
was
never
put
up
for
public
tender
and
the
jackals
of
liberal
bankers
get
a
share
out
of
it
that
was
a
bit
of
that
you
did
with
dauriat
he
gave
you
a
thousand
crowns
to
let
nathan
alone
in
the
eighteenth
century
when
journalism
was
still
in
its
infancy
this
kind
of
blackmail
was
levied
by
pamphleteers
in
the
pay
of
favorites
and
great
lords
the
original
inventor
was
pietro
aretino
a
great
italian
kings
went
in
fear
of
him
as
go
in
fear
of
a
newspaper
what
did
you
do
to
the
matifat
to
make
the
thousand
crowns
i
attacked
florine
in
half
a
dozen
papers
florine
complained
to
matifat
matifat
went
to
braulard
to
find
out
what
the
attacks
meant
i
did
my
for
finot
benefit
and
finot
put
braulard
on
the
wrong
scent
braulard
told
the
man
of
drugs
that
were
demolishing
florine
in
coralie
interest
then
giroudeau
went
round
to
matifat
and
told
him
in
confidence
that
the
whole
business
could
be
accommodated
if
he
matifat
would
consent
to
sell
his
sixth
share
in
finot
review
for
ten
thousand
francs
finot
was
to
give
me
a
thousand
crowns
if
the
dodge
succeeded
well
matifat
was
only
too
glad
to
get
back
ten
thousand
francs
out
of
the
thirty
thousand
invested
in
a
risky
speculation
as
he
thought
for
florine
had
been
telling
him
for
several
days
past
that
finot
review
was
doing
badly
and
instead
of
paying
a
dividend
something
was
said
of
calling
up
more
capital
so
matifat
was
just
about
to
close
with
the
offer
when
the
manager
of
the
comes
to
him
with
some
accommodation
bills
that
he
wanted
to
negotiate
before
filing
his
schedule
to
induce
matifat
to
take
them
of
him
he
let
out
a
word
of
finot
trick
matifat
being
a
shrewd
man
of
business
took
the
hint
held
tight
to
his
sixth
and
is
laughing
in
his
sleeve
at
us
finot
and
i
are
howling
with
despair
we
have
been
so
misguided
as
to
attack
a
man
who
has
no
affection
for
his
mistress
a
heartless
soulless
wretch
unluckily
too
for
us
matifat
business
is
not
amenable
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
press
and
he
can
not
be
made
to
smart
for
it
through
his
interests
a
druggist
is
not
like
a
hatter
or
a
milliner
or
a
theatre
or
a
work
of
art
he
is
above
criticism
you
ca
run
down
his
opium
and
dyewoods
nor
cocoa
beans
paint
and
pepper
florine
is
at
her
wits
end
the
panorama
closes
and
what
will
become
of
her
she
does
not
know
coralie
engagement
at
the
gymnase
begins
in
a
few
days
said
lucien
she
might
do
something
for
florine
not
she
said
lousteau
coralie
is
not
clever
but
she
is
not
quite
simple
enough
to
help
herself
to
a
rival
we
are
in
a
mess
with
a
vengeance
and
finot
is
in
such
a
hurry
to
buy
back
his
sixth
why
it
is
a
capital
bit
of
business
my
dear
fellow
there
is
a
chance
of
selling
the
paper
for
three
hundred
thousand
francs
finot
would
have
and
his
partners
besides
are
going
to
pay
him
a
commission
which
he
will
share
with
des
lupeaulx
so
i
propose
to
do
another
turn
of
seems
to
mean
your
money
or
your
life
it
is
better
than
that
said
lousteau
it
is
your
money
or
your
character
a
short
time
ago
the
proprietor
of
a
minor
newspaper
was
refused
credit
the
day
before
yesterday
it
was
announced
in
his
columns
that
a
gold
repeater
set
with
diamonds
belonging
to
a
certain
notability
had
found
its
way
in
a
curious
fashion
into
the
hands
of
a
private
soldier
in
the
guards
the
story
promised
to
the
readers
might
have
come
from
the
the
notability
lost
no
time
in
asking
that
editor
to
dine
with
him
the
editor
was
distinctly
a
gainer
by
the
transaction
and
contemporary
history
has
lost
an
anecdote
whenever
the
press
makes
vehement
onslaughts
upon
some
one
in
power
you
may
be
sure
that
there
is
some
refusal
to
do
a
service
behind
it
blackmailing
with
regard
to
private
life
is
the
terror
of
the
richest
englishman
and
a
great
source
of
wealth
to
the
press
in
england
which
is
infinitely
more
corrupt
than
ours
we
are
children
in
comparison
in
england
they
will
pay
five
or
six
thousand
francs
for
a
compromising
letter
to
sell
again
then
how
can
you
lay
hold
of
matifat
asked
lucien
my
dear
boy
that
low
tradesman
wrote
the
queerest
letters
to
florine
the
spelling
style
and
matter
of
them
is
ludicrous
to
the
last
degree
we
can
strike
him
in
the
very
midst
of
his
lares
and
penates
where
he
feels
himself
safest
without
so
much
as
mentioning
his
name
and
he
can
not
complain
for
he
lives
in
fear
and
terror
of
his
wife
imagine
his
wrath
when
he
sees
the
first
number
of
a
little
serial
entitled
the
of
a
and
is
given
fair
warning
that
his
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
certain
journalists
he
talks
about
the
god
cupid
he
tells
florine
that
she
enables
him
to
cross
the
desert
of
life
which
looks
as
if
he
took
her
for
a
camel
and
spells
with
two
v
there
is
enough
in
that
immensely
funny
correspondence
to
bring
an
influx
of
subscribers
for
a
fortnight
he
will
shake
in
his
shoes
lest
an
anonymous
letter
should
supply
his
wife
with
the
key
to
the
riddle
the
question
is
whether
florine
will
consent
to
appear
to
persecute
matifat
she
has
some
principles
which
is
to
say
some
hopes
still
left
perhaps
she
means
to
keep
the
letters
and
make
something
for
herself
out
of
them
she
is
cunning
as
befits
my
pupil
but
as
soon
as
she
finds
out
that
a
bailiff
is
no
laughing
matter
or
finot
gives
her
a
suitable
present
or
hopes
of
an
engagement
she
will
give
me
the
letters
and
i
will
sell
them
to
finot
finot
will
put
the
correspondence
in
his
uncle
hands
and
giroudeau
will
bring
matifat
to
terms
these
confidences
sobered
lucien
his
first
thought
was
that
he
had
some
extremely
dangerous
friends
his
second
that
it
would
be
impolitic
to
break
with
them
for
if
mme
mme
de
bargeton
and
chatelet
should
fail
to
keep
their
word
with
him
he
might
need
their
terrible
power
yet
by
this
time
etienne
and
lucien
had
reached
barbet
miserable
bookshop
on
the
quai
etienne
addressed
barbet
we
have
five
thousand
francs
worth
of
bills
at
six
nine
and
twelve
months
given
by
fendant
and
cavalier
are
you
willing
to
discount
them
for
us
i
will
give
you
three
thousand
francs
for
them
said
barbet
with
imperturbable
coolness
three
thousand
francs
echoed
lucien
nobody
else
will
give
you
as
much
rejoined
the
bookseller
the
firm
will
go
bankrupt
before
three
months
are
out
but
i
happen
to
know
that
they
have
some
good
books
that
are
hanging
on
hand
they
can
not
afford
to
wait
so
i
shall
buy
their
stock
for
cash
and
pay
them
with
their
own
bills
and
get
the
books
at
a
reduction
of
two
thousand
francs
that
how
it
is
do
you
mind
losing
a
couple
of
thousand
francs
lucien
asked
lousteau
yes
lucien
answered
vehemently
he
was
dismayed
by
this
first
rebuff
you
are
making
a
mistake
said
etienne
you
wo
find
any
one
that
will
take
their
paper
said
barbet
your
book
is
their
last
stake
sir
the
printer
will
not
trust
them
they
are
obliged
to
leave
the
copies
in
pawn
with
him
if
they
make
a
hit
now
it
will
only
stave
off
bankruptcy
for
another
six
months
sooner
or
later
they
will
have
to
go
they
are
cleverer
at
tippling
than
at
bookselling
in
my
own
case
their
bills
mean
business
and
that
being
so
i
can
afford
to
give
more
than
a
professional
discounter
who
simply
looks
at
the
signatures
it
is
a
business
to
know
whether
the
three
names
on
a
bill
are
each
good
for
thirty
per
cent
in
case
of
bankruptcy
and
here
at
the
outset
you
only
offer
two
signatures
and
neither
of
them
worth
ten
per
cent
the
two
journalists
exchanged
glances
in
surprise
here
was
a
little
scrub
of
a
bookseller
putting
the
essence
of
the
art
and
mystery
of
in
these
few
words
that
will
do
barbet
said
lousteau
can
you
tell
us
of
a
that
will
look
at
us
there
is
daddy
chaboisseau
on
the
quai
you
know
he
tided
fendant
over
his
last
monthly
settlement
if
you
wo
listen
to
my
offer
you
might
go
and
see
what
he
says
to
you
but
you
would
only
come
back
to
me
and
then
i
shall
offer
you
two
thousand
francs
instead
of
three
etienne
and
lucien
betook
themselves
to
the
quai
and
found
chaboisseau
in
a
little
house
with
a
passage
entry
chaboisseau
a
whose
dealings
were
principally
with
the
book
trade
lived
in
a
lodging
furnished
in
the
most
eccentric
manner
a
banker
and
millionaire
to
boot
he
had
a
taste
for
the
classical
style
the
cornice
was
in
the
classical
style
the
bedstead
in
the
purest
classical
taste
dated
from
the
time
of
the
empire
when
such
things
were
in
fashion
the
purple
hangings
fell
over
the
wall
like
the
classic
draperies
in
the
background
of
one
of
david
pictures
chairs
and
tables
lamps
and
sconces
and
every
least
detail
had
evidently
been
sought
with
patient
care
in
furniture
warehouses
there
was
the
elegance
of
antiquity
about
the
classic
revival
as
well
as
its
fragile
and
somewhat
arid
grace
the
man
himself
like
his
manner
of
life
was
in
grotesque
contrast
with
the
airy
mythological
look
of
his
rooms
and
it
may
be
remarked
that
the
most
eccentric
characters
are
found
among
men
who
give
their
whole
energies
to
men
of
this
stamp
are
in
a
certain
sense
intellectual
libertines
everything
is
within
their
reach
consequently
their
fancy
is
jaded
and
they
will
make
immense
efforts
to
shake
off
their
indifference
the
student
of
human
nature
can
always
discover
some
hobby
some
accessible
weakness
and
sensitive
spot
in
their
heart
chaboisseau
might
have
entrenched
himself
in
antiquity
as
in
an
impregnable
camp
the
man
will
be
an
antique
to
match
no
doubt
said
etienne
smiling
chaboisseau
a
little
old
person
with
powdered
hair
wore
a
greenish
coat
and
waistcoat
he
was
tricked
out
besides
in
black
ribbed
stockings
and
shoes
that
creaked
as
he
came
forward
to
take
the
bills
after
a
short
scrutiny
he
returned
them
to
lucien
with
a
serious
countenance
mm
fendant
and
cavalier
are
delightful
young
fellows
they
have
plenty
of
intelligence
but
i
have
no
money
he
said
blandly
my
friend
here
would
be
willing
to
meet
you
in
the
matter
of
discount
etienne
began
i
would
not
take
the
bills
on
any
consideration
returned
the
little
broker
the
words
slid
down
upon
lousteau
suggestion
like
the
blade
of
the
guillotine
on
a
man
neck
the
two
friends
withdrew
but
as
chaboisseau
went
prudently
out
with
them
across
the
lucien
noticed
a
pile
of
books
chaboisseau
had
been
in
the
trade
and
this
was
a
recent
purchase
shining
conspicuous
among
them
he
noticed
a
copy
of
a
work
by
the
architect
ducereau
which
gives
exceedingly
accurate
plans
of
various
royal
palaces
and
chateaux
in
france
could
you
let
me
have
that
book
he
asked
yes
said
chaboisseau
transformed
into
a
bookseller
how
much
fifty
francs
it
is
dear
but
i
want
it
and
i
can
only
pay
you
with
one
of
the
bills
which
you
refuse
to
take
you
have
a
bill
there
for
five
hundred
francs
at
six
months
i
will
take
that
one
of
you
said
chaboisseau
apparently
at
the
last
statement
of
accounts
there
had
been
a
balance
of
five
hundred
francs
in
favor
of
fendant
and
cavalier
they
went
back
to
the
classical
department
chaboisseau
made
out
a
little
memorandum
interest
so
much
and
commission
so
much
total
deduction
thirty
francs
then
he
subtracted
fifty
francs
for
ducerceau
book
finally
from
a
full
of
coin
he
took
four
hundred
and
twenty
francs
look
here
though
chaboisseau
the
bills
are
either
all
of
them
good
or
all
bad
alike
why
do
you
take
the
rest
this
is
not
discounting
i
am
paying
myself
for
a
sale
said
the
old
man
etienne
and
lucien
were
still
laughing
at
chaboisseau
without
understanding
him
when
they
reached
dauriat
shop
and
etienne
asked
gabusson
to
give
them
the
name
of
a
gabusson
thus
appealed
to
gave
them
a
letter
of
introduction
to
a
broker
in
the
boulevard
poissonniere
telling
them
at
the
same
time
that
this
was
the
oddest
and
queerest
party
to
use
his
own
expression
that
he
gabusson
had
come
across
the
friends
took
a
cab
by
the
hour
and
went
to
the
address
if
samanon
wo
take
your
bills
gabusson
had
said
nobody
else
will
look
at
them
a
bookseller
on
the
ground
floor
a
on
the
first
story
and
a
seller
of
indecent
prints
on
the
second
samanon
carried
on
a
fourth
business
he
was
a
into
the
bargain
no
character
in
hoffmann
romances
no
miser
of
scott
can
compare
with
this
freak
of
human
and
parisian
nature
always
admitting
that
samanon
was
human
in
spite
of
himself
lucien
shuddered
at
the
sight
of
the
little
old
creature
whose
bones
seemed
to
be
cutting
a
leather
skin
spotted
with
all
sorts
of
little
green
and
yellow
patches
like
a
portrait
by
titian
or
veronese
when
you
look
at
it
closely
one
of
samanon
eyes
was
fixed
and
glassy
the
other
lively
and
bright
he
seemed
to
keep
that
dead
eye
for
the
part
of
his
profession
and
the
other
for
the
trade
in
the
pornographic
curiosities
upstairs
a
few
stray
white
hairs
escaping
from
under
a
small
sleek
rusty
black
wig
stood
erect
above
a
sallow
forehead
with
a
suggestion
of
menace
about
it
a
hollow
trench
in
either
cheek
defined
the
outline
of
the
jaws
while
a
set
of
projecting
teeth
still
white
seemed
to
stretch
the
skin
of
the
lips
with
the
effect
of
an
equine
yawn
the
contrast
between
the
eyes
and
grinning
mouth
gave
samanon
a
passably
ferocious
air
and
the
very
bristles
on
the
man
chin
looked
stiff
and
sharp
as
pins
nor
was
there
the
slightest
sign
about
him
of
any
desire
to
redeem
a
sinister
appearance
by
attention
to
the
toilet
his
threadbare
jacket
was
all
but
dropping
to
pieces
a
cravat
which
had
once
been
black
was
frayed
by
contact
with
a
stubble
chin
and
left
on
exhibition
a
throat
as
wrinkled
as
a
this
was
the
individual
whom
etienne
and
lucien
discovered
in
his
filthy
busily
affixing
tickets
to
the
backs
of
a
parcel
of
books
from
a
recent
sale
in
a
glance
the
friends
exchanged
the
innumerable
questions
raised
by
the
existence
of
such
a
creature
then
they
presented
gabusson
introduction
and
fendant
and
bills
samanon
was
still
reading
the
note
when
a
third
comer
entered
the
wearer
of
a
short
jacket
which
seemed
in
the
shop
to
be
cut
out
of
a
piece
of
zinc
roofing
so
solid
was
it
by
reason
of
alloy
with
all
kinds
of
foreign
matter
oddly
attired
as
he
was
the
man
was
an
artist
of
no
small
intellectual
power
and
ten
years
later
he
was
destined
to
assist
in
the
inauguration
of
the
great
but
system
i
want
my
coat
my
black
trousers
and
satin
waistcoat
said
this
person
pressing
a
numbered
ticket
on
samanon
attention
samanon
touched
the
brass
button
of
a
and
a
woman
came
down
from
some
upper
region
a
normande
apparently
to
judge
by
her
rich
fresh
complexion
let
the
gentleman
have
his
clothes
said
samanon
holding
out
a
hand
to
the
newcomer
it
a
pleasure
to
do
business
with
you
sir
but
that
youngster
whom
one
of
your
friends
introduced
to
me
took
me
in
most
abominably
took
in
chuckled
the
newcomer
pointing
out
samanon
to
the
two
journalists
with
an
extremely
comical
gesture
the
great
man
dropped
thirty
sous
into
the
yellow
wrinkled
hand
like
the
neapolitan
he
was
taking
his
best
clothes
out
of
pawn
for
a
state
occasion
the
coins
dropped
jingling
into
the
till
what
queer
business
are
you
up
to
asked
lousteau
of
the
artist
an
who
dwelt
among
visions
of
enchanted
palaces
till
he
either
could
not
or
would
not
create
lends
you
a
good
deal
more
than
an
ordinary
pawnbroker
on
anything
you
pledge
and
besides
he
is
so
awfully
charitable
he
allows
you
to
take
your
clothes
out
when
you
must
have
something
to
wear
i
am
going
to
dine
with
the
kellers
and
my
mistress
he
continued
and
to
me
it
is
easier
to
find
thirty
sous
than
two
hundred
francs
so
i
keep
my
wardrobe
here
it
has
brought
the
charitable
usurer
a
hundred
francs
in
the
last
six
months
samanon
has
devoured
my
library
already
volume
by
volume
a
and
sou
by
sou
lousteau
said
with
a
laugh
i
will
let
you
have
fifteen
hundred
francs
said
samanon
looking
up
lucien
started
as
if
the
had
thrust
a
skewer
through
his
heart
samanon
was
subjecting
the
bills
and
their
dates
to
a
close
scrutiny
and
even
then
he
added
i
must
see
fendant
first
he
ought
to
deposit
some
books
with
me
you
are
worth
much
turning
to
lucien
you
are
living
with
coralie
and
your
furniture
has
been
attached
lousteau
watching
lucien
saw
him
take
up
his
bills
and
dash
out
into
the
street
he
is
the
devil
himself
exclaimed
the
poet
for
several
seconds
he
stood
outside
gazing
at
the
shop
front
the
whole
place
was
so
pitiful
that
a
could
not
see
it
without
smiling
at
the
sight
and
wondering
what
kind
of
business
a
man
could
do
among
those
mean
dirty
shelves
of
ticketed
books
a
very
few
moments
later
the
great
man
in
incognito
came
out
very
well
dressed
smiled
at
his
friends
and
turned
to
go
with
them
in
the
direction
of
the
passage
des
panoramas
where
he
meant
to
complete
his
toilet
by
the
polishing
of
his
boots
if
you
see
samanon
in
a
bookseller
shop
or
calling
on
a
or
a
printer
you
may
know
that
it
is
all
over
with
that
man
said
the
artist
samanon
is
the
undertaker
come
to
take
the
measurements
for
a
coffin
you
wo
discount
your
bills
now
lucien
said
etienne
if
samanon
will
not
take
them
nobody
else
will
he
is
the
said
the
stranger
he
is
one
of
gigonnet
lambs
a
spy
for
palma
werbrust
gobseck
and
the
rest
of
those
crocodiles
who
swim
in
the
paris
every
man
with
a
fortune
to
make
or
unmake
is
sure
to
come
across
one
of
them
sooner
or
later
if
you
can
not
discount
your
bills
at
fifty
per
cent
remarked
lousteau
you
must
exchange
them
for
hard
cash
how
give
them
to
coralie
camusot
will
cash
them
for
you
are
disgusted
added
lousteau
as
lucien
cut
him
short
with
a
start
what
nonsense
how
can
you
allow
such
a
silly
scruple
to
turn
the
scale
when
your
future
is
in
the
balance
i
shall
take
this
money
to
coralie
in
any
case
began
lucien
here
is
more
folly
cried
lousteau
you
will
not
keep
your
creditors
quiet
with
four
hundred
francs
when
you
must
have
four
thousand
let
us
keep
a
little
and
get
drunk
on
it
if
we
lose
the
rest
at
et
that
is
sound
advice
said
the
great
man
those
words
spoken
not
four
paces
from
frascati
were
magnetic
in
their
effect
the
friends
dismissed
their
cab
and
went
up
to
the
at
the
outset
they
won
three
thousand
francs
then
they
lost
and
fell
to
five
hundred
again
they
won
three
thousand
seven
hundred
francs
and
again
they
lost
all
but
a
piece
after
another
turn
of
luck
they
staked
two
thousand
francs
on
an
even
number
to
double
the
stake
at
a
stroke
an
even
number
had
not
turned
up
for
five
times
in
succession
and
this
was
the
sixth
time
they
punted
the
whole
sum
and
an
odd
number
turned
up
once
more
after
two
hours
of
frenzied
excitement
the
two
dashed
down
the
staircase
with
the
hundred
francs
kept
back
for
the
dinner
upon
the
steps
between
two
pillars
which
support
the
little
veranda
to
which
so
many
eyes
have
been
upturned
in
longing
or
despair
lousteau
stopped
and
looked
into
lucien
flushed
excited
face
let
us
just
try
fifty
francs
he
said
and
up
the
stairs
again
they
went
an
hour
later
they
owned
a
thousand
crowns
black
had
turned
up
for
the
fifth
consecutive
time
they
trusted
that
their
previous
luck
would
not
repeat
itself
and
put
the
whole
sum
on
the
red
black
turned
up
for
the
sixth
time
they
had
lost
it
was
now
six
let
us
just
try
francs
said
lucien
the
new
venture
was
soon
made
and
lost
the
francs
went
in
five
stakes
then
lucien
in
a
frenzy
flung
down
his
last
francs
on
the
number
of
his
age
and
won
no
words
can
describe
how
his
hands
trembled
as
he
raked
in
the
coins
which
the
bank
paid
him
one
by
one
he
handed
ten
louis
to
lousteau
fly
he
cried
take
it
to
very
lousteau
took
the
hint
and
went
to
order
dinner
lucien
left
alone
laid
his
thirty
louis
on
the
red
and
won
emboldened
by
the
inner
voice
which
a
gambler
always
hears
he
staked
the
whole
again
on
the
red
and
again
he
won
he
felt
as
if
there
were
a
furnace
within
him
without
heeding
the
voice
he
laid
a
hundred
and
twenty
louis
on
the
black
and
lost
then
to
the
torturing
excitement
of
suspense
succeeded
the
delicious
feeling
of
relief
known
to
the
gambler
who
has
nothing
left
to
lose
and
must
perforce
leave
the
palace
of
fire
in
which
his
dreams
melt
and
vanish
he
found
lousteau
at
very
and
flung
himself
upon
the
cookery
to
make
use
of
lafontaine
expression
and
drowned
his
cares
in
wine
by
nine
his
ideas
were
so
confused
that
he
could
not
imagine
why
the
portress
in
the
rue
de
vendome
persisted
in
sending
him
to
the
rue
de
la
lune
mlle
coralie
has
gone
said
the
woman
she
has
taken
lodgings
elsewhere
she
left
her
address
with
me
on
this
scrap
of
paper
lucien
was
too
far
gone
to
be
surprised
at
anything
he
went
back
to
the
cab
which
had
brought
him
and
was
driven
to
the
rue
de
la
lune
making
puns
to
himself
on
the
name
of
the
street
as
he
went
the
news
of
the
failure
of
the
had
come
like
a
coralie
taking
alarm
made
haste
to
sell
her
furniture
with
the
consent
of
her
creditors
to
little
old
cardot
who
installed
florentine
in
the
rooms
at
once
the
tradition
of
the
house
remained
unbroken
coralie
paid
her
creditors
and
satisfied
the
landlord
proceeding
with
her
as
she
called
it
while
berenice
bought
the
absolutely
indispensable
necessaries
to
furnish
a
lodging
in
the
rue
de
la
lune
a
few
doors
from
the
gymnase
here
coralie
was
waiting
for
lucien
return
she
had
brought
her
love
unsullied
out
of
the
shipwreck
and
twelve
hundred
francs
lucien
more
than
half
intoxicated
poured
out
his
woes
to
coralie
and
berenice
you
did
quite
right
my
angel
said
coralie
with
her
arms
about
his
neck
berenice
can
easily
negotiate
your
bills
with
braulard
the
next
morning
lucien
awoke
to
an
enchanted
world
of
happiness
made
about
him
by
coralie
she
was
more
loving
and
tender
in
those
days
than
she
had
ever
been
perhaps
she
thought
that
the
wealth
of
love
in
her
heart
should
make
him
amends
for
the
poverty
of
their
lodging
she
looked
bewitchingly
charming
with
the
loose
hair
straying
from
under
the
crushed
white
silk
handkerchief
about
her
head
there
was
soft
laughter
in
her
eyes
her
words
were
as
bright
as
the
first
rays
of
sunrise
that
shone
in
through
the
windows
pouring
a
flood
of
gold
upon
such
charming
poverty
not
that
the
room
was
squalid
the
walls
were
covered
with
a
paper
bordered
with
red
there
was
one
mirror
over
the
and
a
second
above
the
chest
of
drawers
the
bare
boards
were
covered
with
a
cheap
carpet
which
berenice
had
bought
in
spite
of
orders
and
paid
for
out
of
her
own
little
store
a
wardrobe
with
a
glass
door
and
a
chest
held
the
lovers
clothing
the
mahogany
chairs
were
covered
with
blue
cotton
stuff
and
berenice
had
managed
to
save
a
clock
and
a
couple
of
china
vases
from
the
catastrophe
as
well
as
four
spoons
and
forks
and
little
spoons
the
bedroom
was
entered
from
the
which
might
have
belonged
to
a
clerk
with
an
income
of
twelve
hundred
francs
the
kitchen
was
next
the
landing
and
berenice
slept
above
in
an
attic
the
rent
was
not
more
than
a
hundred
crowns
the
dismal
house
boasted
a
sham
carriage
entrance
the
porter
box
being
contrived
behind
one
of
the
useless
leaves
of
the
gate
and
lighted
by
a
peephole
through
which
that
personage
watched
the
comings
and
goings
of
seventeen
families
for
this
hive
was
a
property
in
auctioneer
phrase
lucien
looking
round
the
room
discovered
a
desk
an
paper
pens
and
ink
the
sight
of
berenice
in
high
spirits
she
was
building
hopes
on
coralie
at
the
gymnase
and
of
coralie
herself
conning
her
part
with
a
knot
of
blue
ribbon
tied
about
it
drove
all
cares
and
anxieties
from
the
sobered
poet
mind
so
long
as
nobody
in
society
hears
of
this
sudden
comedown
we
shall
pull
through
he
said
after
all
we
have
four
thousand
five
hundred
francs
before
us
i
will
turn
my
new
position
in
royalist
journalism
to
account
we
shall
start
the
i
am
an
old
hand
now
and
i
will
make
something
out
and
coralie
seeing
nothing
but
love
in
the
words
kissed
the
lips
that
uttered
them
by
this
time
berenice
had
set
the
table
near
the
fire
and
served
a
modest
breakfast
of
scrambled
eggs
a
couple
of
cutlets
coffee
and
cream
just
then
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
lucien
to
his
astonishment
beheld
three
of
his
loyal
friends
of
old
days
leon
giraud
and
michel
chrestien
he
was
deeply
touched
and
asked
them
to
share
the
breakfast
no
we
have
come
on
more
serious
business
than
condolence
said
we
know
the
whole
story
we
have
just
come
from
the
rue
de
vendome
you
know
my
opinions
lucien
under
any
other
circumstances
i
should
be
glad
to
hear
that
you
had
adopted
my
political
convictions
but
situated
as
you
are
with
regard
to
the
liberal
press
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
go
over
to
the
ultras
your
life
will
be
sullied
your
character
blighted
for
ever
we
have
come
to
entreat
you
in
the
name
of
our
friendship
weakened
though
it
may
be
not
to
soil
yourself
in
this
way
you
have
been
prominent
in
attacking
the
romantics
the
right
and
the
government
you
can
not
now
declare
for
the
government
the
right
and
the
romantics
my
reasons
for
the
change
are
based
on
lofty
grounds
the
end
will
justify
the
means
said
lucien
perhaps
you
do
not

our
position
on
the
side
of
the
government
said
leon
giraud
the
government
the
court
the
bourbons
the
absolutist
party
or
to
sum
up
in
the
general
expression
the
whole
system
opposed
to
the
constitutional
system
may
be
divided
upon
the
question
of
the
best
means
of
extinguishing
the
revolution
but
is
unanimous
as
to
the
advisability
of
extinguishing
the
newspapers
the
the
and
the
have
all
been
founded
for
the
express
purpose
of
replying
to
the
slander
gibes
and
railing
of
the
liberal
press
i
can
not
approve
them
for
it
is
precisely
this
failure
to
recognize
the
grandeur
of
our
priesthood
that
has
led
us
to
bring
out
a
serious
and
paper
which
perhaps
he
added
parenthetically
may
exercise
a
worthy
influence
before
very
long
and
win
respect
and
carry
weight
but
this
royalist
artillery
is
destined
for
a
first
attempt
at
reprisals
the
liberals
are
to
be
paid
back
in
their
own
coin
shaft
for
shaft
wound
for
wound
what
can
come
of
it
lucien
the
majority
of
newspaper
readers
incline
for
the
left
and
in
the
press
as
in
warfare
the
victory
is
with
the
big
battalions
you
will
be
blackguards
liars
enemies
of
the
people
the
other
side
will
be
defenders
of
their
country
martyrs
men
to
be
held
in
honor
though
they
may
be
even
more
hypocritical
and
slippery
than
their
opponents
in
these
ways
the
pernicious
influence
of
the
press
will
be
increased
while
the
most
odious
form
of
journalism
will
receive
sanction
insult
and
personalities
will
become
a
recognized
privilege
of
the
press
newspapers
have
taken
this
tone
in
the
subscribers
interests
and
when
both
sides
have
recourse
to
the
same
weapons
the
standard
is
set
and
the
general
tone
of
journalism
taken
for
granted
when
the
evil
is
developed
to
its
fullest
extent
restrictive
laws
will
be
followed
by
prohibitions
there
will
be
a
return
of
the
censorship
of
the
press
imposed
after
the
assassination
of
the
duc
de
berri
and
repealed
since
the
opening
of
the
chambers
and
do
you
know
what
the
nation
will
conclude
from
the
debate
the
people
will
believe
the
insinuations
of
the
liberal
press
they
will
think
that
the
bourbons
mean
to
attack
the
rights
of
property
acquired
by
the
revolution
and
some
fine
day
they
will
rise
and
shake
off
the
bourbons
you
are
not
only
soiling
your
life
lucien
you
are
going
over
to
the
losing
side
you
are
too
young
too
lately
a
journalist
too
little
initiated
into
the
secret
springs
of
motive
and
the
tricks
of
the
craft
you
have
aroused
too
much
jealousy
not
to
fall
a
victim
to
the
general
hue
and
cry
that
will
be
raised
against
you
in
the
liberal
newspapers
you
will
be
drawn
into
the
fray
by
party
spirit
now
still
at
though
the
fever
which
spent
itself
in
violence
in
and
now
appears
in
debates
in
the
chamber
and
polemics
in
the
papers
i
am
not
quite
a
featherhead
my
friends
said
lucien
though
you
may
choose
to
see
a
poet
in
me
whatever
may
happen
i
shall
gain
one
solid
advantage
which
no
liberal
victory
can
give
me
by
the
time
your
victory
is
won
i
shall
have
gained
my
end
we
will
cut
off
your
hair
said
michel
chrestien
with
a
laugh
i
shall
have
my
children
by
that
time
said
lucien
and
if
you
cut
off
my
head
it
will
not
matter
the
three
could
make
nothing
of
lucien
intercourse
with
the
great
world
had
developed
in
him
the
pride
of
caste
the
vanities
of
the
aristocrat
the
poet
thought
and
not
without
reason
that
there
was
a
fortune
in
his
good
looks
and
intellect
accompanied
by
the
name
and
title
of
rubempre
mme
and
mme
de
bargeton
held
him
fast
by
this
clue
as
a

holds
a
cockchafer
by
a
string
lucien
flight
was
circumscribed
the
words
he
is
one
of
us
he
is
sound
accidentally
overheard
but
three
days
ago
in
mlle
de

salon
had
turned
his
head
the

the
duc
de

the

rastignac
blondet
the
lovely
duchesse
de

the

des
lupeaulx
all
the
most
influential
people
at
court
in
fact
had
congratulated
him
on
his
conversion
and
completed
his
intoxication
then
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
rejoined
you
of
all
men
will
find
it
hard
to
keep
clean
hands
and
i
know
you
lucien
you
will
feel
it
acutely
when
you
are
despised
by
the
very
men
to
whom
you
offer
yourself
the
three
took
leave
and
not
one
of
them
gave
him
a
friendly
handshake
lucien
was
thoughtful
and
sad
for
a
few
minutes
oh
never
mind
those
ninnies
cried
coralie
springing
upon
his
knee
and
putting
her
beautiful
arms
about
his
neck
they
take
life
seriously
and
life
is
a
joke
besides
you
are
going
to
be

i
will
wheedle
the
if
there
is
no
other
way
i
know
how
to
come
round
that
rake
of
a
des

who
will
sign
your
patent
did
i
not
tell
you
lucien
that
at
the
last
you
should
have
coralie
dead
body
for
a
stepping
stone
next
day
lucien
allowed
his
name
to
appear
in
the
list
of
contributors
to
the
his
name
was
announced
in
the
prospectus
with
a
flourish
of
trumpets
and
the
ministry
took
care
that
a
hundred
thousand
copies
should
be
scattered
abroad
far
and
wide
there
was
a
dinner
at
robert
two
doors
away
from
frascati
to
celebrate
the
inauguration
and
the
whole
band
of
royalist
writers
for
the
press
were
present
martainville
was
there
and
auger
and
destains
and
a
host
of
others
still
living
who
did
monarchy
and
religion
to
use
the
familiar
expression
coined
for
them
nathan
had
also
enlisted
under
the
banner
for
he
was
thinking
of
starting
a
theatre
and
not
unreasonably
held
that
it
was
better
to
have
the
licensing
authorities
for
him
than
against
him
we
will
pay
the
liberals
out
cried
merlin
gentlemen
said
nathan
if
we
are
for
war
let
us
have
war
in
earnest
we
must
not
carry
it
on
with
let
us
fall
upon
all
classicals
and
liberals
without
distinction
of
age
or
sex
and
put
them
all
to
the
sword
with
ridicule
there
must
be
no
quarter
we
must
act
honorably
there
must
be
no
bribing
with
copies
of
books
or
presents
no
taking
money
of
publishers
we
must
inaugurate
a
restoration
of
journalism

said
martainville

us

i

complete

of

a
war
of
extermination
was
unanimously
resolved
upon
and
by
one
in
the
morning
all
shades
of
opinion
were
merged
and
drowned
together
with
every
glimmer
of
sense
in
a
flaming
bowl
of
punch
we
have
had
a
fine
monarchical
and
religious
jollification
remarked
an
illustrious
reveler
in
the
doorway
as
he
went
that
comment
appeared
in
the
next
day
issue
of
the
through
the
good
offices
of
a
publisher
among
the
guests
and
became
historic
lucien
was
supposed
to
be
the
traitor
who
blabbed
his
defection
gave
the
signal
for
a
terrific
hubbub
in
the
liberal
camp
lucien
was
the
butt
of
the
opposition
newspapers
and
ridiculed
unmercifully
the
whole
history
of
his
sonnets
was
given
to
the
public
dauriat
was
said
to
prefer
a
first
loss
of
a
thousand
crowns
to
the
risk
of
publishing
the
verses
lucien
was
called
the
poet
sans
sonnets
and
one
morning
in
that
very
paper
in
which
he
had
so
brilliant
a
beginning
he
read
the
following
lines
significant
enough
for
him
but
barely
intelligible
to
other
readers
if
dauriat
persistently
withholds
the
sonnets
of
the
future
petrarch
from
publication
we
will
act
like
generous
foes
we
will
open
our
own
columns
to
his
poems
which
must
be
piquant
indeed
to
judge
by
the
following
specimen
obligingly
communicated
by
a
friend
of
the
author
and
close
upon
that
ominous
preface
followed
a
sonnet
entitled
the
thistle
chardon
a
seedling
springing
up
one
day
among
the
flowers
in
a
garden
fair
made
boast
that
splendid
colors
bright
and
rare
its
claims
to
lofty
lineage
should
display
so
for
a
while
they
suffered
it
to
stay
but
with
such
insolence
it
flourished
there
that
out
of
patience
with
its
braggart
air
they
bade
it
prove
its
claims
without
delay
it
bloomed
forthwith
but
was
blundering
clown
upon
the
boards
more
promptly
hooted
down
the
sister
flowers
began
to
jeer
and
laugh
the
owner
flung
it
out
at
close
of
day
a
solitary
jackass
came
to
bray
a
common
thistle
fitting
epitaph
lucien
read
the
words
through
scalding
tears
vernou
touched
elsewhere
on
lucien
gambling
propensities
and
spoke
of
the
forthcoming
of
charles
as
in
its
tendency
the
writer
siding
with
catholic
against
their
calvinist
victims
another
week
found
the
quarrel
embittered
lucien
had
counted
upon
his
friend
etienne
etienne
owed
him
a
thousand
francs
and
there
had
been
besides
a
private
understanding
between
them
but
etienne
lousteau
during
the
interval
became
his
sworn
foe
and
this
was
the
manner
of
it
for
the
past
three
months
nathan
had
been
smitten
with
charms
and
much
at
a
loss
how
to
rid
himself
of
lousteau
his
rival
who
was
in
fact
dependent
upon
the
actress
and
now
came
opportunity
when
florine
was
frantic
with
distress
over
the
failure
of
the
which
left
her
without
an
engagement
he
went
as
lucien
colleague
to
beg
coralie
to
ask
for
a
part
for
florine
in
a
play
of
his
which
was
about
to
be
produced
at
the
gymnase
then
nathan
went
to
florine
and
made
capital
with
her
out
of
the
service
done
by
the
promise
of
a
conditional
engagement
ambition
turned
florine
head
she
did
not
hesitate
she
had
had
time
to
gauge
lousteau
pretty
thoroughly
lousteau
courses
were
weakening
his
will
and
here
was
nathan
with
his
ambitions
in
politics
and
literature
and
energies
strong
as
his
cravings
florine
proposed
to
reappear
on
the
stage
with
renewed
eclat
so
she
handed
over
correspondence
to
nathan
nathan
drove
a
bargain
for
them
with
matifat
and
took
the
sixth
share
of
finot
review
in
exchange
for
the
compromising
billets
after
this
florine
was
installed
in
sumptuously
furnished
apartments
in
the
rue
hauteville
where
she
took
nathan
for
her
protector
in
the
face
of
the
theatrical
and
journalistic
world
lousteau
was
terribly
overcome
he
wept
towards
the
close
of
a
dinner
given
by
his
friends
to
console
him
in
his
affliction
in
the
course
of
that
banquet
it
was
decided
that
nathan
had
not
acted
unfairly
several
writers
present
finot
and
vernou
for
instance
knew
of
florine
fervid
admiration
for
dramatic
literature
but
they
all
agreed
that
lucien
had
behaved
very
ill
when
he
arranged
that
business
at
the
gymnase
he
had
indeed
broken
the
most
sacred
laws
of
friendship
and
zeal
to
serve
his
new
friends
had
led
the
royalist
poet
on
to
sin
beyond
forgiveness
nathan
was
carried
away
by
passion
pronounced
bixiou
while
this
provincial
as
blondet
calls
him
is
simply
scheming
for
his
own
selfish
ends
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
deep
plots
were
laid
by
all
parties
alike
to
rid
themselves
of
this
little
upstart
intruder
of
a
poet
who
wanted
to
eat
everybody
up
vernou
bore
lucien
a
personal
grudge
and
undertook
to
keep
a
tight
hand
on
him
and
finot
declared
that
lucien
had
betrayed
the
secret
of
the
combination
against
matifat
and
thereby
swindled
him
finot
out
of
fifty
thousand
francs
nathan
acting
on
florine
advice
gained
finot
support
by
selling
him
the
sixth
share
for
fifteen
thousand
francs
and
lousteau
consequently
lost
his
commission
his
thousand
crowns
had
vanished
away
he
could
not
forgive
lucien
for
this
treacherous
blow
as
he
supposed
it
dealt
to
his
interests
the
wounds
of
vanity
refuse
to
heal
if
oxide
of
silver
gets
into
them
no
words
no
amount
of
description
can
depict
the
wrath
of
an
author
in
a
paroxysm
of
mortified
vanity
nor
the
energy
which
he
discovers
when
stung
by
the
poisoned
darts
of
sarcasm
but
on
the
other
hand
the
man
that
is
roused
to
by
a
personal
attack
usually
subsides
very
promptly
the
more
phlegmatic
race
who
take
these
things
quietly
lay
their
account
with
the
oblivion
which
speedily
overtakes
the
spiteful
article
these
are
the
truly
courageous
men
of
letters
and
if
the
weaklings
seem
at
first
to
be
the
strong
men
they
can
not
hold
out
for
any
length
of
time
during
that
first
fortnight
while
the
fury
was
upon
him
lucien
poured
a
perfect
hailstorm
of
articles
into
the
royalist
papers
in
which
he
shared
the
responsibilities
of
criticism
with
hector
merlin
he
was
always
in
the
breach
pounding
away
with
all
his
might
in
the
backed
up
by
martainville
the
only
one
among
his
associates
who
stood
by
him
without
an
afterthought
martainville
was
not
in
the
secret
of
certain
understandings
made
and
ratified
amid
jokes
or
at
dauriat
in
the
wooden
galleries
or
behind
the
scenes
at
the
vaudeville
when
journalists
of
either
side
met
on
neutral
ground
when
lucien
went
to
the
greenroom
of
the
vaudeville
he
met
with
no
welcome
the
men
of
his
own
party
held
out
a
hand
to
shake
the
others
cut
him
and
all
the
while
hector
merlin
and
theodore
gaillard
fraternized
unblushingly
with
finot
lousteau
and
vernou
and
the
rest
of
the
journalists
who
were
known
for
good
fellows
the
greenroom
of
the
vaudeville
in
those
days
was
a
hotbed
of
gossip
as
well
as
a
neutral
ground
where
men
of
every
shade
of
opinion
could
meet
so
much
so
that
the
president
of
a
court
of
law
after
reproving
a
learned
brother
in
a
certain
council
chamber
for
sweeping
the
greenroom
with
his
gown
met
the
subject
of
his
strictures
gown
to
gown
in
the
greenroom
of
the
vaudeville
lousteau
in
time
shook
hands
again
with
nathan
finot
came
thither
almost
every
evening
and
lucien
whenever
he
could
spare
the
time
went
to
the
vaudeville
to
watch
the
enemies
who
showed
no
sign
of
relenting
towards
the
unfortunate
boy
in
the
time
of
the
restoration
party
hatred
was
far
more
bitter
than
in
our
day
intensity
of
feeling
is
diminished
in
our
age
the
critic
cuts
a
book
to
pieces
and
shakes
hands
with
the
author
afterwards
and
the
victim
must
keep
on
good
terms
with
his
slaughterer
or
run
the
gantlet
of
innumerable
jokes
at
his
expense
if
he
refuses
he
is
unsociable
eaten
up
with
he
is
sulky
and
rancorous
he
bears
malice
he
is
a
bad
let
an
author
receive
a
treacherous
stab
in
the
back
let
him
avoid
the
snares
set
for
him
with
base
hypocrisy
and
endure
the
most
unhandsome
treatment
he
must
still
exchange
greetings
with
his
assassin
who
for
that
matter
claims
the
esteem
and
friendship
of
his
victim
everything
can
be
excused
and
justified
in
an
age
which
has
transformed
vice
into
virtue
and
virtue
into
vice
has
come
to
be
the
most
sacred
of
our
liberties
the
representatives
of
the
most
opposite
opinions
courteously
blunt
the
edge
of
their
words
and
fence
with
buttoned
foils
but
in
those
almost
forgotten
days
the
same
theatre
could
scarcely
hold
certain
royalist
and
liberal
journalists
the
most
malignant
provocation
was
offered
glances
were
like
the
least
spark
produced
an
explosion
of
quarrel
who
has
not
heard
his
neighbor
oath
on
the
entrance
of
some
man
in
the
forefront
of
the
battle
on
the
opposing
side
there
were
but
two
parties
royalists
and
liberals
classics
and
romantics
you
found
the
same
hatred
masquerading
in
either
form
and
no
longer
wondered
at
the
scaffolds
of
the
convention
lucien
had
been
a
liberal
and
a
hot
voltairean
now
he
was
a
rabid
royalist
and
a
romantic
martainville
the
only
one
among
his
colleagues
who
really
liked
him
and
stood
by
him
loyally
was
more
hated
by
the
liberals
than
any
man
on
the
royalist
side
and
this
fact
drew
down
all
the
hate
of
the
liberals
on
lucien
head
martainville
staunch
friendship
injured
lucien
political
parties
show
scanty
gratitude
to
outpost
sentinels
and
leave
leaders
of
forlorn
hopes
to
their
fate
is
a
rule
of
warfare
which
holds
equally
good
in
matters
political
to
keep
with
the
main
body
of
the
army
if
you
mean
to
succeed
the
spite
of
the
small
liberal
papers
fastened
at
once
on
the
opportunity
of
coupling
the
two
names
and
flung
them
into
each
other
arms
their
friendship
real
or
imaginary
brought
down
upon
them
both
a
series
of
articles
written
by
pens
dipped
in
gall
felicien
vernou
was
furious
with
jealousy
of
lucien
social
success
and
believed
like
all
his
old
associates
in
the
poet
approaching
elevation
the
fiction
of
lucien
treason
was
embellished
with
every
kind
of
aggravating
circumstance
he
was
called
judas
the
less
martainville
being
judas
the
great
for
martainville
was
supposed
rightly
or
wrongly
to
have
given
up
the
bridge
of
pecq
to
the
foreign
invaders
lucien
said
jestingly
to
des
lupeaulx
that
he
himself
surely
had
given
up
the
asses
bridge
lucien
luxurious
life
hollow
though
it
was
and
founded
on
expectations
had
estranged
his
friends
they
could
not
forgive
him
for
the
carriage
which
he
had
put
down
for
them
he
was
still
rolling
about
in
it
nor
yet
for
the
splendors
of
the
rue
de
vendome
which
he
had
left
all
of
them
felt
instinctively
that
nothing
was
beyond
the
reach
of
this
young
and
handsome
poet
with
intellect
enough
and
to
spare
they
themselves
had
trained
him
in
corruption
and
therefore
they
left
no
stone
unturned
to
ruin
him
some
few
days
before
coralie
first
appearance
at
the
gymnase
lucien
and
hector
merlin
went
to
the
vaudeville
merlin
was
scolding
his
friend
for
giving
a
helping
hand
to
nathan
in
affair
you
then
and
there
made
two
mortal
enemies
of
lousteau
and
nathan
he
said
i
gave
you
good
advice
and
you
took
no
notice
of
it
you
gave
praise
you
did
them
a
good
turn
you
will
be
well
punished
for
your
kindness
florine
and
coralie
will
never
live
in
peace
on
the
same
stage
both
will
wish
to
be
first
you
can
only
defend
coralie
in
our
papers
and
nathan
not
only
has
a
pull
as
a
dramatic
author
he
can
control
the
dramatic
criticism
in
the
liberal
newspapers
he
has
been
a
journalist
a
little
longer
than
you
the
words
responded
to
lucien
inward
misgivings
neither
nathan
nor
gaillard
was
treating
him
with
the
frankness
which
he
had
a
right
to
expect
but
so
new
a
convert
could
hardly
complain
gaillard
utterly
confounded
lucien
by
saying
roundly
that
newcomers
must
give
proofs
of
their
sincerity
for
some
time
before
their
party
could
trust
them
there
was
more
jealousy
than
he
had
imagined
in
the
inner
circles
of
royalist
and
ministerial
journalism
the
jealousy
of
curs
fighting
for
a
bone
is
apt
to
appear
in
the
human
species
when
there
is
a
loaf
to
divide
there
is
the
same
growling
and
showing
of
teeth
the
same
characteristics
come
out
in
every
possible
way
these
writers
of
articles
tried
to
injure
each
other
with
those
in
power
they
brought
reciprocal
accusations
of
lukewarm
zeal
they
invented
the
most
treacherous
ways
of
getting
rid
of
a
rival
there
had
been
none
of
this
internecine
warfare
among
the
liberals
they
were
too
far
from
power
too
hopelessly
out
of
favor
and
lucien
amid
the
inextricable
tangle
of
ambitions
had
neither
the
courage
to
draw
sword
and
cut
the
knot
or
the
patience
to
unravel
it
he
could
not
be
the
beaumarchais
the
aretino
the
freron
of
his
epoch
he
was
not
made
of
such
stuff
he
thought
of
nothing
but
his
one
desire
the
patent
of
nobility
for
he
saw
clearly
that
for
him
such
a
restoration
meant
a
wealthy
marriage
and
the
title
once
secured
chance
and
his
good
looks
would
do
the
rest
this
was
all
his
plan
and
etienne
lousteau
who
had
confided
so
much
to
him
knew
his
secret
knew
how
to
deal
a
deathblow
to
the
poet
of
angouleme
that
very
night
as
lucien
and
merlin
went
to
the
vaudeville
etienne
had
laid
a
terrible
trap
into
which
an
inexperienced
boy
could
not
but
fall
here
is
our
handsome
lucien
said
finot
drawing
des
lupeaulx
in
the
direction
of
the
poet
and
shaking
hands
with
feline
amiability
i
can
not
think
of
another
example
of
such
rapid
success
continued
finot
looking
from
des
lupeaulx
to
lucien
there
are
two
sorts
of
success
in
paris
there
is
a
fortune
in
solid
cash
which
any
one
can
amass
and
there
is
the
intangible
fortune
of
connections
position
or
a
footing
in
certain
circles
inaccessible
for
certain
persons
however
rich
they
may
be
now
my
friend
here
our
friend
interposed
des
lupeaulx
smiling
blandly
our
friend
repeated
finot
patting
lucien
hand
has
made
a
brilliant
success
from
this
point
of
view
truth
to
tell
lucien
has
more
in
him
more
gift
more
wit
than
the
rest
of
us
that
envy
him
and
he
is
enchantingly
handsome
besides
his
old
friends
can
not
forgive
him
for
his
success
they
call
it
luck
luck
of
that
sort
never
comes
to
fools
or
incapables
said
des
lupeaulx
can
you
call
bonaparte
fortune
luck
eh
there
were
a
score
of
applicants
for
the
command
of
the
army
in
italy
just
as
there
are
a
hundred
young
men
at
this
moment
who
would
like
to
have
an
entrance
to
mlle
des
touches
house
people
are
coupling
her
name
with
yours
already
in
society
my
dear
boy
said
des
lupeaulx
clapping
lucien
on
the
shoulder
ah
you
are
in
high
favor
mme
mme
de
bargeton
and
mme
de
montcornet
are
wild
about
you
you
are
going
to
mme
firmiani
party
are
you
not
and
to
the
duchesse
de
grandlieu
rout
yes
said
lucien
allow
me
to
introduce
a
young
banker
to
you
a
du
tillet
you
ought
to
be
acquainted
he
has
contrived
to
make
a
great
fortune
in
a
short
time
lucien
and
du
tillet
bowed
and
entered
into
conversation
and
the
banker
asked
lucien
to
dinner
finot
and
des
lupeaulx
a
pair
knew
each
other
well
enough
to
keep
upon
good
terms
they
turned
away
to
continue
their
chat
on
one
of
the
sofas
in
the
greenroom
and
left
lucien
with
du
tillet
merlin
and
nathan
by
the
way
my
friend
said
finot
tell
me
how
things
stand
is
there
really
somebody
behind
lucien
for
he
is
the
of
my
staff
and
before
allowing
them
to
plot
against
him
i
thought
i
should
like
to
know
whether
in
your
opinion
it
would
be
better
to
baffle
them
and
keep
well
with
him
the
master
of
requests
and
finot
looked
at
each
other
very
closely
for
a
moment
or
two
my
dear
fellow
said
des
lupeaulx
how
can
you
imagine
that
the
marquise
or
chatelet
or
mme
de
bargeton
who
has
procured
the
baron
nomination
to
the
prefecture
and
the
title
of
count
so
as
to
return
in
triumph
to
angouleme
how
can
you
suppose
that
any
of
them
will
forgive
lucien
for
his
attacks
on
them
they
dropped
him
down
in
the
royalist
ranks
to
crush
him
out
of
existence
at
this
moment
they
are
looking
round
for
any
excuse
for
not
fulfilling
the
promises
they
made
to
that
boy
help
them
to
some
you
will
do
the
greatest
possible
service
to
the
two
women
and
some
day
or
other
they
will
remember
it
i
am
in
their
secrets
i
was
surprised
to
find
how
much
they
hated
the
little
fellow
this
lucien
might
have
rid
himself
of
his
bitterest
enemy
mme
de
bargeton
by
desisting
from
his
attacks
on
terms
which
a
woman
loves
to
grant
do
you
take
me
he
is
young
and
handsome
he
should
have
drowned
her
hate
in
torrents
of
love
he
would
be
comte
de
rubempre
by
this
time
the
would
have
obtained
some
sinecure
for
him
some
post
in
the
royal
household
lucien
would
have
made
a
very
pretty
reader
to
louis
xviii
he
might
have
been
librarian
somewhere
or
other
master
of
requests
for
a
joke
master
of
revels
what
you
please
the
young
fool
has
missed
his
chance
perhaps
that
is
his
unpardonable
sin
instead
of
imposing
his
conditions
he
has
accepted
them
when
lucien
was
caught
with
the
bait
of
the
patent
of
nobility
the
baron
chatelet
made
a
great
step
coralie
has
been
the
ruin
of
that
boy
if
he
had
not
had
the
actress
for
his
mistress
he
would
have
turned
again
to
the
and
he
would
have
had
her
too
then
we
can
knock
him
over
how
des
lupeaulx
asked
carelessly
he
saw
a
way
of
gaining
credit
with
the
marquise
for
this
service
he
is
under
contract
to
write
for
lousteau
paper
and
we
can
the
better
hold
him
to
his
agreement
because
he
has
not
a
sou
if
we
tickle
up
the
keeper
of
the
seals
with
a
facetious
article
and
prove
that
lucien
wrote
it
he
will
consider
that
lucien
is
unworthy
of
the
king
favor
we
have
a
plot
on
hand
besides
coralie
will
be
ruined
and
our
distinguished
provincial
will
lose
his
head
when
his
mistress
is
hissed
off
the
stage
and
left
without
an
engagement
when
once
the
patent
is
suspended
we
will
laugh
at
the
victim
aristocratic
pretensions
and
allude
to
his
mother
the
nurse
and
his
father
the
apothecary
lucien
courage
is
only
skindeep
he
will
collapse
we
will
send
him
back
to
his
provinces
nathan
made
florine
sell
me
matifat
sixth
share
of
the
review
i
was
able
to
buy
dauriat
and
i
are
the
only
proprietors
now
we
might
come
to
an
understanding
you
and
i
and
the
review
might
be
taken
over
for
the
benefit
of
the
court
i
stipulated
for
the
restitution
of
my
sixth
before
i
undertook
to
protect
nathan
and
florine
they
let
me
have
it
and
i
must
help
them
but
i
wished
to
know
first
how
lucien
stood
you
deserve
your
name
said
des
lupeaulx
i
like
a
man
of
your
sort
very
well
then
can
you
arrange
a
definite
engagement
for
florine
asked
finot
yes
but
rid
us
of
lucien
for
rastignac
and
de
marsay
never
wish
to
hear
of
him
again
sleep
in
peace
returned
finot
nathan
and
merlin
will
always
have
articles
ready
for
gaillard
who
will
promise
to
take
them
lucien
will
never
get
a
line
into
the
paper
we
will
cut
off
his
supplies
there
is
only
martainville
paper
left
him
in
which
to
defend
himself
and
coralie
what
can
a
single
paper
do
against
so
many
i
will
let
you
know
the
weak
points
of
the
ministry
but
get
lucien
to
write
that
article
and
hand
over
the
manuscript
said
des
lupeaulx
who
refrained
carefully
from
informing
finot
that
promised
patent
was
nothing
but
a
joke
when
des
lupeaulx
had
gone
finot
went
to
lucien
and
taking
the
tone
which
deceives
so
many
victims
he
explained
that
he
could
not
possibly
afford
to
lose
his
contributor
and
at
the
same
time
he
shrank
from
taking
proceedings
which
might
ruin
him
with
his
friends
of
the
other
side
finot
himself
liked
a
man
who
was
strong
enough
to
change
his
opinions
they
were
pretty
sure
to
come
across
one
another
he
and
lucien
and
might
be
mutually
helpful
in
a
thousand
little
ways
lucien
besides
needed
a
sure
man
in
the
liberal
party
to
attack
the
ultras
and
men
in
office
who
might
refuse
to
help
him
suppose
that
they
play
you
false
what
will
you
do
finot
ended
suppose
that
some
minister
fancies
that
he
has
you
fast
by
the
halter
of
your
apostasy
and
turns
the
cold
shoulder
on
you
you
will
be
glad
to
set
on
a
few
dogs
to
snap
at
his
legs
will
you
not
very
well
but
you
have
made
a
deadly
enemy
of
lousteau
he
is
thirsting
for
your
blood
you
and
felicien
are
not
on
speaking
terms
i
only
remain
to
you
it
is
a
rule
of
the
craft
to
keep
a
good
understanding
with
every
man
of
real
ability
in
the
world
which
you
are
about
to
enter
you
can
do
me
services
in
return
for
mine
with
the
press
but
business
first
let
me
have
purely
literary
articles
they
will
not
compromise
you
and
we
shall
have
executed
our
agreement
lucien
saw
nothing
but
and
a
shrewd
eye
to
business
in
finot
offer
finot
and
des
lupeaulx
had
flattered
him
and
he
was
in
a
good
humor
he
actually
thanked
finot
ambitious
men
like
all
those
who
can
only
make
their
way
by
the
help
of
others
and
of
circumstances
are
bound
to
lay
their
plans
very
carefully
and
to
adhere
very
closely
to
the
course
of
conduct
on
which
they
determine
it
is
a
cruel
moment
in
the
lives
of
such
aspirants
when
some
unknown
power
brings
the
fabric
of
their
fortunes
to
some
severe
test
and
everything
gives
way
at
once
threads
are
snapped
or
entangled
and
misfortune
appears
on
every
side
let
a
man
lose
his
head
in
the
confusion
it
is
all
over
with
him
but
if
he
can
resist
this
first
revolt
of
circumstances
if
he
can
stand
erect
until
the
tempest
passes
over
or
make
a
supreme
effort
and
reach
the
serene
sphere
about
the
storm
then
he
is
really
strong
to
every
man
unless
he
is
born
rich
there
comes
sooner
or
later
his
fatal
week
as
it
must
be
called
for
napoleon
for
instance
that
week
was
the
retreat
from
moscow
it
had
begun
now
for
lucien
social
and
literary
success
had
come
to
him
too
easily
he
had
had
such
luck
that
he
was
bound
to
know
reverses
and
to
see
men
and
circumstances
turn
against
him
the
first
blow
was
the
heaviest
and
the
most
keenly
felt
for
it
touched
lucien
where
he
thought
himself
invulnerable
in
his
heart
and
his
love
coralie
might
not
be
clever
but
hers
was
a
noble
nature
and
she
possessed
the
great
actress
faculty
of
suddenly
standing
aloof
from
self
this
strange
phenomenon
is
subject
until
it
degenerates
into
a
habit
with
long
practice
to
the
caprices
of
character
and
not
seldom
to
an
admirable
delicacy
of
feeling
in
actresses
who
are
still
young
coralie
to
all
appearance
bold
and
wanton
as
the
part
required
was
in
reality
girlish
and
timid
and
love
had
wrought
in
her
a
revulsion
of
her
woman
heart
against
the
comedian
mask
art
the
supreme
art
of
feigning
passion
and
feeling
had
not
yet
triumphed
over
nature
in
her
she
shrank
before
a
great
audience
from
the
utterance
that
belongs
to
love
alone
and
coralie
suffered
besides
from
another
true
woman
weakness
she
needed
success
born
stage
queen
though
she
was
she
could
not
confront
an
audience
with
which
she
was
out
of
sympathy
she
was
nervous
when
she
appeared
on
the
stage
a
cold
reception
paralyzed
her
each
new
part
gave
her
the
terrible
sensations
of
a
first
appearance
applause
produced
a
sort
of
intoxication
which
gave
her
encouragement
without
flattering
her
vanity
at
a
murmur
of
dissatisfaction
or
before
a
silent
house
she
flagged
but
a
great
audience
following
attentively
admiringly
willing
to
be
pleased
electrified
coralie
she
felt
at
once
in
communication
with
the
nobler
qualities
of
all
those
listeners
she
felt
that
she
possessed
the
power
of
stirring
their
souls
and
carrying
them
with
her
but
if
this
action
and
reaction
of
the
audience
upon
the
actress
reveals
the
nervous
organization
of
genius
it
shows
no
less
clearly
the
poor
child
sensitiveness
and
delicacy
lucien
had
discovered
the
treasures
of
her
nature
had
learned
in
the
past
months
that
this
woman
who
loved
him
was
still
so
much
of
a
girl
and
coralie
was
unskilled
in
the
wiles
of
an
actress
she
could
not
fight
her
own
battles
nor
protect
herself
against
the
machinations
of
jealousy
behind
the
scenes
florine
was
jealous
of
her
and
florine
was
as
dangerous
and
depraved
as
coralie
was
simple
and
generous
roles
must
come
to
find
coralie
she
was
too
proud
to
implore
authors
or
to
submit
to
dishonoring
conditions
she
would
not
give
herself
to
the
first
journalist
who
persecuted
her
with
his
advances
and
threatened
her
with
his
pen
genius
is
rare
enough
in
the
extraordinary
art
of
the
stage
but
genius
is
only
one
condition
of
success
among
many
and
is
positively
hurtful
unless
it
is
accompanied
by
a
genius
for
intrigue
in
which
coralie
was
utterly
lacking
lucien
knew
how
much
his
friend
would
suffer
on
her
first
appearance
at
the
gymnase
and
was
anxious
at
all
costs
to
obtain
a
success
for
her
but
all
the
money
remaining
from
the
sale
of
the
furniture
and
all
lucien
earnings
had
been
sunk
in
costumes
in
the
furniture
of
a
and
the
expenses
of
a
first
appearance
a
few
days
later
lucien
made
up
his
mind
to
a
humiliating
step
for
love
sake
he
took
fendant
and
cavalier
bills
and
went
to
the
in
the
rue
des
bourdonnais
he
would
ask
camusot
to
discount
them
the
poet
had
not
fallen
so
low
that
he
could
make
this
attempt
quite
coolly
there
had
been
many
a
sharp
struggle
first
and
the
way
to
that
decision
had
been
paved
with
many
dreadful
thoughts
nevertheless
he
arrived
at
last
in
the
dark
cheerless
little
private
office
that
looked
out
upon
a
yard
and
found
camusot
seated
gravely
there
this
was
not
coralie
infatuated
adorer
not
the
indolent
incredulous
libertine
whom
he
had
known
hitherto
as
camusot
but
a
heavy
father
of
a
family
a
merchant
grown
old
in
shrewd
expedients
of
business
and
respectable
virtues
wearing
a
mask
of
judicial
prudery
this
camusot
was
the
cool
head
of
the
firm
surrounded
by
clerks
green
cardboard
boxes
pigeonholes
invoices
and
samples
and
fortified
by
the
presence
of
a
wife
and
a
daughter
lucien
trembled
from
head
to
foot
as
he
approached
for
the
worthy
merchant
like
the
turned
cool
indifferent
eyes
upon
him
here
are
two
or
three
bills
monsieur
he
said
standing
beside
the
merchant
who
did
not
rise
from
his
desk
if
you
will
take
them
of
me
you
will
oblige
me
extremely
you
have
taken
something
of
monsieur
said
camusot
i
do
not
forget
it
on
this
lucien
explained
coralie
predicament
he
spoke
in
a
low
voice
bending
to
murmur
his
explanation
so
that
camusot
could
hear
the
heavy
throbbing
of
the
humiliated
poet
heart
it
was
no
part
of
camusot
plans
that
coralie
should
suffer
a
check
he
listened
smiling
to
himself
over
the
signatures
on
the
bills
for
as
a
judge
at
the
tribunal
of
commerce
he
knew
how
the
booksellers
stood
but
in
the
end
he
gave
lucien
four
thousand
five
hundred
francs
for
them
stipulating
that
he
should
add
the
formula
for
value
received
in
silks
lucien
went
straight
to
braulard
and
made
arrangements
for
a
good
reception
braulard
promised
to
come
to
the
to
determine
on
the
points
where
his
romans
should
work
their
fleshy
clappers
to
bring
down
the
house
in
applause
lucien
gave
the
rest
of
the
money
to
coralie
he
did
not
tell
her
how
he
had
come
by
it
and
allayed
her
anxieties
and
the
fears
of
berenice
who
was
sorely
troubled
over
their
daily
expenses
martainville
came
several
times
to
hear
coralie
rehearse
and
he
knew
more
of
the
stage
than
most
men
of
his
time
several
royalist
writers
had
promised
favorable
articles
lucien
had
not
a
suspicion
of
the
impending
disaster
a
fatal
event
occurred
on
the
evening
before
coralie
book
had
appeared
and
the
editor
of
merlin
paper
considering
lucien
to
be
the
best
qualified
man
on
the
staff
gave
him
the
book
to
review
he
owed
his
unlucky
reputation
to
those
articles
on
nathan
work
there
were
several
men
in
the
office
at
the
time
for
all
the
staff
had
been
summoned
martainville
was
explaining
that
the
party
warfare
with
the
liberals
must
be
waged
on
certain
lines
nathan
merlin
all
the
contributors
in
fact
were
talking
of
leon
giraud
paper
and
remarking
that
its
influence
was
the
more
pernicious
because
the
language
was
guarded
cool
moderate
people
were
beginning
to
speak
of
the
circle
in
the
rue
des
as
a
second
convention
it
had
been
decided
that
the
royalist
papers
were
to
wage
a
systematic
war
of
extermination
against
these
dangerous
opponents
who
indeed
at
a
later
day
were
destined
to
sow
the
doctrines
that
drove
the
bourbons
into
exile
but
that
was
only
after
the
most
brilliant
of
royalist
writers
had
joined
them
for
the
sake
of
a
mean
revenge
absolutist
opinions
were
not
known
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
he
shared
the
views
of
his
clique
he
fell
under
the
same
anathema
and
he
was
to
be
the
first
victim
his
book
was
to
be
honored
with
a
slashing
article
to
use
the
consecrated
formula
lucien
refused
to
write
the
article
great
was
the
commotion
among
the
leading
royalist
writers
thus
met
in
conclave
lucien
was
told
plainly
that
a
renegade
could
not
do
as
he
pleased
if
it
did
not
suit
his
views
to
take
the
side
of
the
monarchy
and
religion
he
could
go
back
to
the
other
camp
merlin
and
martainville
took
him
aside
and
begged
him
as
his
friends
to
remember
that
he
would
simply
hand
coralie
over
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
liberal
papers
for
she
would
find
no
champions
on
the
royalist
and
ministerial
side
her
acting
was
certain
to
provoke
a
hot
battle
and
the
kind
of
discussion
which
every
actress
longs
to
arouse
you
do
understand
it
in
the
least
said
martainville
if
she
plays
for
three
months
amid
a
of
criticism
she
will
make
thirty
thousand
francs
when
she
goes
on
tour
in
the
provinces
at
the
end
of
the
season
and
here
are
you
about
to
sacrifice
coralie
and
your
own
future
and
to
quarrel
with
your
own
bread
and
butter
all
for
a
scruple
that
will
always
stand
in
your
way
and
ought
to
be
got
rid
of
at
once
lucien
was
forced
to
choose
between
and
coralie
his
mistress
would
be
ruined
unless
he
dealt
his
friend
a
in
the
and
the
great
newspaper
poor
poet
he
went
home
with
death
in
his
soul
and
by
the
fireside
he
sat
and
read
that
finest
production
of
modern
literature
tears
fell
fast
over
it
as
the
pages
turned
for
a
long
while
he
hesitated
but
at
last
he
took
up
the
pen
and
wrote
a
sarcastic
article
of
the
kind
that
he
understood
so
well
taking
the
book
as
children
might
take
some
bright
bird
to
strip
it
of
its
plumage
and
torture
it
his
sardonic
jests
were
sure
to
tell
again
he
turned
to
the
book
and
as
he
read
it
over
a
second
time
his
better
self
awoke
in
the
dead
of
night
he
hurried
across
paris
and
stood
outside
house
he
looked
up
at
the
windows
and
saw
the
faint
pure
gleam
of
light
in
the
panes
as
he
had
so
often
seen
it
with
a
feeling
of
admiration
for
the
noble
steadfastness
of
that
truly
great
nature
for
some
moments
he
stood
irresolute
on
the
curbstone
he
had
not
courage
to
go
further
but
his
good
angel
urged
him
on
he
tapped
at
the
door
and
opened
and
found
sitting
reading
in
a
fireless
room
what
has
happened
asked
for
news
of
some
dreadful
kind
was
visible
in
lucien
ghastly
face
your
book
is
sublime
said
lucien
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
they
have
ordered
me
to
write
an
attack
upon
it
poor
boy
the
bread
that
they
give
you
is
hard
indeed
said
i
only
ask
for
one
favor
keep
my
visit
a
secret
and
leave
me
to
my
hell
to
the
occupations
of
the
damned
perhaps
it
is
impossible
to
attain
to
success
until
the
heart
is
seared
and
callous
in
every
most
sensitive
spot
the
same
as
ever
cried
do
you
think
me
a
base
poltroon
no
no
i
am
a
boy
half
crazed
with
love
and
he
told
his
story
let
us
look
at
the
article
said
touched
by
all
that
lucien
said
of
coralie
lucien
held
out
the
manuscript
read
and
could
not
help
smiling
oh
what
a
fatal
waste
of
intellect
he
began
but
at
the
sight
of
lucien
overcome
with
grief
in
the
opposite
armchair
he
checked
himself
will
you
leave
it
with
me
to
correct
i
will
let
you
have
it
again
he
went
on
flippancy
depreciates
a
work
serious
and
conscientious
criticism
is
sometimes
praise
in
itself
i
know
a
way
to
make
your
article
more
honorable
both
for
yourself
and
for
me
besides
i
know
my
faults
well
enough
when
you
climb
a
hot
shadowless
hillside
you
sometimes
find
fruit
to
quench
your
torturing
thirst
and
i
have
found
it
here
and
now
said
lucien
as
he
sprang
sobbing
to
arms
and
kissed
his
friend
on
the
forehead
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
leaving
my
conscience
in
your
keeping
some
day
i
will
come
to
you
and
ask
for
it
again
i
look
upon
a
periodical
repentance
as
great
hypocrisy
said
solemnly
repentance
becomes
a
sort
of
indemnity
for
wrongdoing
repentance
is
virginity
of
the
soul
which
we
must
keep
for
god
a
man
who
repents
twice
is
a
horrible
sycophant
i
am
afraid
that
you
regard
repentance
as
absolution
lucien
went
slowly
back
to
the
rue
de
la
lune
stricken
dumb
by
those
words
next
morning
sent
back
his
article
recast
throughout
and
lucien
sent
it
in
to
the
review
but
from
that
day
melancholy
preyed
upon
him
and
he
could
not
always
disguise
his
mood
that
evening
when
the
theatre
was
full
he
experienced
for
the
first
time
the
paroxysm
of
nervous
terror
caused
by
a
terror
aggravated
in
his
case
by
all
the
strength
of
his
love
vanity
of
every
kind
was
involved
he
looked
over
the
rows
of
faces
as
a
criminal
eyes
the
judges
and
the
jury
on
whom
his
life
depends
a
murmur
would
have
set
him
quivering
any
slight
incident
upon
the
stage
coralie
exits
and
entrances
the
slightest
modulation
of
the
tones
of
her
voice
would
perturb
him
beyond
all
reason
the
play
in
which
coralie
made
her
first
appearance
at
the
gymnase
was
a
piece
of
the
kind
which
sometimes
falls
flat
at
first
and
afterwards
has
immense
success
it
fell
flat
that
night
coralie
was
not
applauded
when
she
came
on
and
the
chilly
reception
reacted
upon
her
the
only
applause
came
from
camusot
box
and
various
persons
posted
in
the
balcony
and
galleries
silenced
camusot
with
repeated
cries
of
hush
the
galleries
even
silenced
the
when
they
led
off
with
exaggerated
salvos
martainville
applauded
bravely
nathan
merlin
and
the
treacherous
florine
followed
his
example
but
it
was
clear
that
the
piece
was
a
failure
a
crowd
gathered
in
coralie
and
consoled
her
till
she
had
no
courage
left
she
went
home
in
despair
less
for
her
own
sake
than
for
lucien
braulard
has
betrayed
us
lucien
said
coralie
was
heartstricken
the
next
day
found
her
in
a
high
fever
utterly
unfit
to
play
face
to
face
with
the
thought
that
she
had
been
cut
short
in
her
career
lucien
hid
the
papers
from
her
and
looked
them
over
in
the
the
reviewers
one
and
all
attributed
the
failure
of
the
piece
to
coralie
she
had
overestimated
her
strength
she
might
be
the
delight
of
a
boulevard
audience
but
she
was
out
of
her
element
at
the
gymnase
she
had
been
inspired
by
a
laudable
ambition
but
she
had
not
taken
her
powers
into
account
she
had
chosen
a
part
to
which
she
was
quite
unequal
lucien
read
on
through
a
pile
of
put
together
on
the
same
system
as
his
attack
upon
nathan
milo
of
crotona
when
he
found
his
hands
fast
in
the
oak
which
he
himself
had
cleft
was
not
more
furious
than
lucien
he
grew
haggard
with
rage
his
friends
gave
coralie
the
most
treacherous
advice
in
the
language
of
kindly
counsel
and
friendly
interest
she
should
play
according
to
these
authorities
all
kind
of
roles
which
the
treacherous
writers
of
these
unblushing
knew
to
be
utterly
unsuited
to
her
genius
and
these
were
the
royalist
papers
led
off
by
nathan
as
for
the
liberal
press
all
the
weapons
which
lucien
had
used
were
now
turned
against
him
coralie
heard
a
sob
followed
by
another
and
another
she
sprang
out
of
bed
to
find
lucien
and
saw
the
papers
nothing
would
satisfy
her
but
she
must
read
them
all
and
when
she
had
read
them
she
went
back
to
bed
and
lay
there
in
silence
florine
was
in
the
plot
she
had
foreseen
the
outcome
she
had
studied
coralie
part
and
was
ready
to
take
her
place
the
management
unwilling
to
give
up
the
piece
was
ready
to
take
florine
in
stead
when
the
manager
came
he
found
poor
coralie
sobbing
and
exhausted
on
her
bed
but
when
he
began
to
say
in
lucien
presence
that
florine
knew
the
part
and
that
the
play
must
be
given
that
evening
coralie
sprang
up
at
once
i
will
play
she
cried
and
sank
fainting
on
the
floor
so
florine
took
the
part
and
made
her
reputation
in
it
for
the
piece
succeeded
the
newspapers
all
sang
her
praises
and
from
that
time
forth
florine
was
the
great
actress
whom
we
all
know
success
exasperated
lucien
to
the
highest
degree
a
wretched
girl
whom
you
helped
to
earn
her
bread
if
the
gymnase
prefers
to
do
so
let
the
management
pay
you
to
cancel
your
engagement
i
shall
be
the
comte
de
rubempre
i
will
make
my
fortune
and
you
shall
be
my
wife
what
nonsense
said
coralie
looking
at
him
with
wan
eyes
nonsense
repeated
he
very
well
wait
a
few
days
and
you
shall
live
in
a
fine
house
you
shall
have
a
carriage
and
i
will
write
a
part
for
you
he
took
two
thousand
francs
and
hurried
to
frascati
for
seven
hours
the
unhappy
victim
of
the
furies
watched
his
varying
luck
and
outwardly
seemed
cool
and
he
experienced
both
extremes
of
fortune
during
that
day
and
part
of
the
night
that
followed
at
one
time
he
possessed
as
much
as
thirty
thousand
francs
and
he
came
out
at
last
without
a
sou
in
the
rue
de
la
lune
he
found
finot
waiting
for
him
with
a
request
for
one
of
his
short
articles
lucien
so
far
forgot
himself
that
he
complained
oh
it
is
not
all
rosy
returned
finot
you
made
your
in
such
a
way
that
you
were
bound
to
lose
the
support
of
the
liberal
press
and
the
liberals
are
far
stronger
in
print
than
all
the
ministerialist
and
royalist
papers
put
together
a
man
should
never
leave
one
camp
for
another
until
he
has
made
a
comfortable
berth
for
himself
by
way
of
consolation
for
the
losses
that
he
must
expect
and
in
any
case
a
prudent
politician
will
see
his
friends
first
and
give
them
his
reasons
for
going
over
and
take
their
opinions
you
can
still
act
together
they
sympathize
with
you
and
you
agree
to
give
mutual
help
nathan
and
merlin
did
that
before
they
went
over
hawks
do
pike
out
hawks
eyes
you
were
as
innocent
as
a
lamb
you
will
be
forced
to
show
your
teeth
to
your
new
party
to
make
anything
out
of
them
you
have
been
necessarily
sacrificed
to
nathan
i
can
not
conceal
from
you
that
your
article
on
has
roused
a
terrific
hubbub
marat
is
a
saint
compared
with
you
you
will
be
attacked
and
your
book
will
be
a
failure
how
far
have
things
gone
with
your
romance
these
are
the
last
proof
sheets
all
the
anonymous
articles
against
that
young
in
the
ministerialist
and
ultra
papers
are
set
down
to
you
the
is
poking
fun
at
the
set
in
the
rue
des
and
the
hits
are
the
more
telling
because
they
are
funny
there
is
a
whole
serious
political
coterie
at
the
back
of
leon
giraud
paper
they
will
come
into
power
too
sooner
or
later
i
have
not
written
a
line
in
the
this
week
past
very
well
keep
my
short
articles
in
mind
write
fifty
of
them
straight
off
and
i
will
pay
you
for
them
in
a
lump
but
they
must
be
of
the
same
color
as
the
paper
and
finot
with
seeming
carelessness
gave
lucien
an
edifying
anecdote
of
the
keeper
of
the
seals
a
piece
of
current
gossip
he
said
for
the
subject
of
one
of
the
papers
eager
to
retrieve
his
losses
at
play
lucien
shook
off
his
dejection
summoned
up
his
energy
and
youthful
force
and
wrote
thirty
articles
of
two
columns
each
these
finished
he
went
to
dauriat
partly
because
he
felt
sure
of
meeting
finot
there
and
he
wished
to
give
the
articles
to
finot
in
person
partly
because
he
wished
for
an
explanation
of
the
of
the
he
found
the
bookseller
shop
full
of
his
enemies
all
the
talk
immediately
ceased
as
he
entered
put
under
the
ban
of
journalism
his
courage
rose
and
once
more
he
said
to
himself
as
he
had
said
in
the
alley
at
the
luxembourg
i
will
triumph
dauriat
was
neither
amiable
or
inclined
to
patronize
he
was
sarcastic
in
tone
and
determined
not
to
bate
an
inch
of
his
rights
the
should
appear
when
it
suited
his
purpose
he
should
wait
until
lucien
was
in
a
position
to
secure
the
success
of
the
book
it
was
his
he
had
bought
it
outright
when
lucien
asserted
that
dauriat
was
bound
to
publish
the
by
the
very
nature
of
the
contract
and
the
relative
positions
of
the
parties
to
the
agreement
dauriat
flatly
contradicted
him
said
that
no
publisher
could
be
compelled
by
law
to
publish
at
a
loss
and
that
he
himself
was
the
best
judge
of
the
expediency
of
producing
the
book
there
was
besides
a
remedy
open
to
lucien
as
any
court
of
law
would
admit
the
poet
was
quite
welcome
to
take
his
verses
to
a
royalist
publisher
upon
the
repayment
of
the
thousand
crowns
lucien
went
away
dauriat
moderate
tone
had
exasperated
him
even
more
than
his
previous
arrogance
at
their
first
interview
so
the
would
not
appear
until
lucien
had
found
a
host
of
formidable
supporters
or
grown
formidable
himself
he
walked
home
slowly
so
oppressed
and
out
of
heart
that
he
felt
ready
for
suicide
coralie
lay
in
bed
looking
white
and
she
must
have
a
part
or
she
will
die
said
berenice
as
lucien
dressed
for
a
great
evening
party
at
mlle
des
touches
house
in
the
rue
du
mont
blanc
des
lupeaulx
and
vignon
and
blondet
were
to
be
there
as
well
as
mme
and
mme
de
bargeton
the
party
was
given
in
honor
of
conti
the
great
composer
owner
likewise
of
one
of
the
most
famous
voices
off
the
stage
cinti
pasta
garcia
levasseur
and
two
or
three
celebrated
amateurs
in
society
not
excepted
lucien
saw
the
marquise
her
cousin
and
mme
de
montcornet
sitting
together
and
made
one
of
the
party
the
unhappy
young
fellow
to
all
appearances
was
happy
and
content
he
jested
he
was
the
lucien
de
rubempre
of
his
days
of
splendor
he
would
not
seem
to
need
help
from
any
one
he
dwelt
on
his
services
to
the
royalist
party
and
cited
the
hue
and
cry
raised
after
him
by
the
liberal
press
as
a
proof
of
his
zeal
and
you
will
be
well
rewarded
my
friend
said
mme
de
bargeton
with
a
gracious
smile
go
to
the
the
day
after
with
heron
and
des
lupeaulx
and
you
will
find
your
patent
signed
by
his
majesty
the
keeper
of
the
seals
will
take
it
to
the
tuileries
but
there
is
to
be
a
meeting
of
the
council
and
he
will
not
come
back
till
late
still
if
i
hear
the
result
evening
i
will
let
you
know
where
are
you
living
i
will
come
to
you
said
lucien
ashamed
to
confess
that
he
was
living
in
the
rue
de
la
lune
the
duc
de
lenoncourt
and
the
duc
de
navarreins
have
made
mention
of
you
to
the
king
added
the
marquise
they
praised
your
absolute
and
entire
devotion
and
said
that
some
distinction
ought
to
avenge
your
treatment
in
the
liberal
press
the
name
and
title
of
rubempre
to
which
you
have
a
claim
through
your
mother
would
become
illustrious
through
you
they
said
the
king
gave
his
lordship
instructions
that
evening
to
prepare
a
patent
authorizing
the
sieur
lucien
chardon
to
bear
the
arms
and
title
of
the
comtes
de
rubempre
as
grandson
of
the
last
count
by
the
mother
side
us
favor
the
pindus
said
his
majesty
after
reading
your
sonnet
on
the
lily
which
my
cousin
luckily
remembered
to
give
the
when
the
king
can
work
miracles
and
change
the
into
an
eagle
de
navarreins
replied
lucien
expansion
of
feeling
would
have
softened
the
heart
of
any
woman
less
deeply
wounded
than
louise
de
negrepelisse
but
her
thirst
for
vengeance
was
only
increased
by
lucien
graciousness
des
lupeaulx
was
right
lucien
was
wanting
in
tact
it
never
crossed
his
mind
that
this
history
of
the
patent
was
one
of
the
mystifications
at
which
mme
was
an
adept
emboldened
with
success
and
the
flattering
distinction
shown
to
him
by
mlle
des
touches
he
stayed
till
two
in
the
morning
for
a
word
in
private
with
his
hostess
lucien
had
learned
in
royalist
newspaper
offices
that
mlle
des
touches
was
the
author
of
a
play
in
which
petite
the
marvel
of
the
moment
was
about
to
appear
as
the
rooms
emptied
he
drew
mlle
des
touches
to
a
sofa
in
the
boudoir
and
told
the
story
of
coralie
misfortune
and
his
own
so
touchingly
that
mlle
des
touches
promised
to
give
the
heroine
part
to
his
friend
that
promise
put
new
life
into
coralie
but
the
next
day
as
they
breakfasted
together
lucien
opened
lousteau
newspaper
and
found
that
unlucky
anecdote
of
the
keeper
of
the
seals
and
his
wife
the
story
was
full
of
the
blackest
malice
lurking
in
the
most
caustic
wit
louis
xviii
was
brought
into
the
story
in
a
masterly
fashion
and
held
up
to
ridicule
in
such
a
way
that
prosecution
was
impossible
here
is
the
substance
of
a
fiction
for
which
the
liberal
party
attempted
to
win
credence
though
they
only
succeeded
in
adding
one
more
to
the
tale
of
their
ingenious
calumnies
the
king
passion
for
notes
and
a
correspondence
full
of
madrigals
and
sparkling
wit
was
declared
to
be
the
last
phase
of
the
tender
passion
love
had
reached
the
doctrinaire
stage
or
had
passed
in
other
words
from
the
concrete
to
the
abstract
the
illustrious
lady
so
cruelly
ridiculed
under
the
name
of
octavie
by
beranger
had
conceived
so
it
was
said
the
gravest
fears
the
correspondence
was
languishing
the
more
octavie
displayed
her
wit
the
cooler
grew
the
royal
lover
at
last
octavie
discovered
the
cause
of
her
decline
her
power
was
threatened
by
the
novelty
and
piquancy
of
a
correspondence
between
the
august
scribe
and
the
wife
of
his
keeper
of
the
seals
that
excellent
woman
was
believed
to
be
incapable
of
writing
a
note
she
was
simply
and
solely
godmother
to
the
efforts
of
audacious
ambition
who
could
be
hidden
behind
her
petticoats
octavie
decided
after
making
observations
of
her
own
that
the
king
was
corresponding
with
his
minister
she
laid
her
plans
with
the
help
of
a
faithful
friend
she
arranged
that
a
stormy
debate
should
detain
the
minister
at
the
chamber
then
she
contrived
to
secure
a
and
to
convince
outraged
majesty
of
the
fraud
louis
xviii
flew
into
a
royal
and
truly
bourbon
passion
but
the
tempest
broke
on
octavie
head
he
would
not
believe
her
octavie
offered
immediate
proof
begging
the
king
to
write
a
note
which
must
be
answered
at
once
the
unlucky
wife
of
the
keeper
of
the
seals
sent
to
the
chamber
for
her
husband
but
precautions
had
been
taken
and
at
that
moment
the
minister
was
on
his
legs
addressing
the
chamber
the
lady
racked
her
brains
and
replied
to
the
note
with
such
intellect
as
she
could
improvise
your
chancellor
will
supply
the
rest
cried
octavie
laughing
at
the
king
chagrin
there
was
not
a
word
of
truth
in
the
story
but
it
struck
home
to
three
persons
the
keeper
of
the
seals
his
wife
and
the
king
it
was
said
that
des
lupeaulx
had
invented
the
tale
but
finot
always
kept
his
counsel
the
article
was
caustic
and
clever
the
liberal
papers
and
the
orleanists
were
delighted
with
it
and
lucien
himself
laughed
and
thought
of
it
merely
as
a
very
amusing
he
called
next
day
for
des
lupeaulx
and
the
baron
du
chatelet
the
baron
had
just
been
to
thank
his
lordship
the
sieur
chatelet
newly
appointed
councillor
extraordinary
was
now
comte
du
chatelet
with
a
promise
of
the
prefecture
of
the
charente
so
soon
as
the
present
prefect
should
have
completed
the
term
of
office
necessary
to
receive
the
maximum
retiring
pension
the
comte
chatelet
for
the
had
been
inserted
in
the
patent
drove
with
lucien
to
the
and
treated
his
companion
as
an
equal
but
for
lucien
articles
he
said
his
patent
would
not
have
been
granted
so
soon
liberal
persecution
had
been
a
to
advancement
des
lupeaulx
was
waiting
for
them
in
the
office
that
functionary
started
with
surprise
when
lucien
appeared
and
looked
at
des
lupeaulx
what
he
exclaimed
to
lucien
utter
bewilderment
do
you
dare
to
come
here
sir
your
patent
was
made
out
but
his
lordship
has
torn
it
up
here
it
is
the
caught
up
the
first
torn
sheet
that
came
to
hand
the
minister
wished
to
discover
the
author
of
yesterday
atrocious
article
and
here
is
the
manuscript
added
the
speaker
holding
out
the
sheets
of
lucien
article
you
call
yourself
a
royalist
sir
and
you
are
on
the
staff
of
that
detestable
paper
which
turns
the
minister
hair
gray
harasses
the
centre
and
is
dragging
the
country
headlong
to
ruin
you
breakfast
on
the
the
the
and
the
you
dine
on
the
and
the
and
then
sup
with
martainville
the
worst
enemy
of
the
government
martainville
urges
the
government
on
to
absolutist
measures
he
is
more
likely
to
bring
on
another
revolution
than
if
he
had
gone
over
to
the
extreme
left
you
are
a
very
clever
journalist
but
you
will
never
make
a
politician
the
minister
denounced
you
to
the
king
and
the
king
was
so
angry
that
he
scolded
le
duc
de
navarreins
his
first
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
your
enemies
will
be
all
the
more
formidable
because
they
have
hitherto
been
your
friends
conduct
that
one
expects
from
an
enemy
is
atrocious
in
a
friend
why
really
my
dear
fellow
are
you
a
child
said
des
lupeaulx
you
have
compromised
me
mme
mme
de
bargeton
and
mme
de
montcornet
who
were
responsible
for
you
must
be
furious
the
duke
is
sure
to
have
handed
on
his
annoyance
to
the
marquise
and
the
marquise
will
have
scolded
her
cousin
keep
away
from
them
and
wait
here
comes
his
lordship
go
said
the
lucien
went
out
into
the
place
vendome
he
was
stunned
by
this
bludgeon
blow
he
walked
home
along
the
boulevards
trying
to
think
over
his
position
he
saw
himself
a
plaything
in
the
hands
of
envy
treachery
and
greed
what
was
he
in
this
world
of
contending
ambitions
a
child
sacrificing
everything
to
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
and
the
gratification
of
vanity
a
poet
whose
thoughts
never
went
beyond
the
moment
a
moth
flitting
from
one
bright
gleaming
object
to
another
he
had
no
definite
aim
he
was
the
slave
of
circumstance
meaning
well
doing
conscience
tortured
him
remorselessly
and
to
crown
it
all
he
was
penniless
and
exhausted
with
work
and
emotion
his
articles
could
not
compare
with
merlin
or
nathan
work
he
walked
at
random
absorbed
in
these
thoughts
as
he
passed
some
of
the
which
were
already
lending
books
as
well
as
newspapers
a
placard
caught
his
eyes
it
was
an
advertisement
of
a
book
with
a
grotesque
title
but
beneath
the
announcement
he
saw
his
name
in
brilliant
letters
by
lucien
chardon
de
rubempre
so
his
book
had
come
out
and
he
had
heard
nothing
of
it
all
the
newspapers
were
silent
he
stood
motionless
before
the
placard
his
arms
hanging
at
his
sides
he
did
not
notice
a
little
knot
of
acquaintances
rastignac
and
de
marsay
and
some
other
fashionable
young
men
nor
did
he
see
that
michel
chrestien
and
leon
giraud
were
coming
towards
him
are
you
m
chardon
it
was
michel
who
spoke
and
there
was
that
in
the
sound
of
his
voice
that
set
lucien
heartstrings
vibrating
do
you
not
know
me
he
asked
turning
very
pale
michel
spat
in
his
face
take
that
as
your
wages
for
your
article
against
if
everybody
would
do
as
i
do
on
his
own
or
his
friend
behalf
the
press
would
be
as
it
ought
to
be
a
and
respected
priesthood
lucien
staggered
back
and
caught
hold
of
rastignac
gentlemen
he
said
addressing
rastignac
and
de
marsay
you
will
not
refuse
to
act
as
my
seconds
but
first
i
wish
to
make
matters
even
and
apology
impossible
he
struck
michel
a
sudden
unexpected
blow
in
the
face
the
rest
rushed
in
between
the
republican
and
royalist
to
prevent
a
street
brawl
rastignac
dragged
lucien
off
to
the
rue
taitbout
only
a
few
steps
away
from
the
boulevard
de
gand
where
this
scene
took
place
it
was
the
hour
of
dinner
or
a
crowd
would
have
assembled
at
once
de
marsay
came
to
find
lucien
and
the
pair
insisted
that
he
should
dine
with
them
at
the
cafe
anglais
where
they
drank
and
made
merry
are
you
a
good
swordsman
inquired
de
marsay
i
have
never
had
a
foil
in
my
hands
a
good
shot
never
fired
a
pistol
in
my
life
then
you
have
luck
on
your
side
you
are
a
formidable
antagonist
to
stand
up
to
you
may
kill
your
man
said
de
marsay
fortunately
lucien
found
coralie
in
bed
and
asleep
she
had
played
without
rehearsal
in
a
play
and
taken
her
revenge
she
had
met
with
genuine
applause
her
enemies
had
not
been
prepared
for
this
step
on
her
part
and
her
success
had
determined
the
manager
to
give
her
the
heroine
part
in
camille
maupin
play
he
had
discovered
the
cause
of
her
apparent
failure
and
was
indignant
with
florine
and
nathan
coralie
should
have
the
protection
of
the
management
at
five
that
morning
rastignac
came
for
lucien
the
name
of
your
street
my
dear
fellow
is
particularly
appropriate
for
your
lodgings
you
are
up
in
the
sky
he
said
by
way
of
greeting
let
us
be
first
upon
the
ground
on
the
road
to
clignancourt
it
is
good
form
and
we
ought
to
set
them
an
example
here
is
the
programme
said
de
marsay
as
the
cab
rattled
through
the
faubourg
you
stand
up
at
paces
coming
nearer
till
you
are
only
fifteen
apart
you
have
each
of
you
five
paces
to
take
and
three
shots
to
fire
no
more
whatever
happens
that
must
be
the
end
of
it
we
load
for
your
antagonist
and
his
seconds
load
for
you
the
weapons
were
chosen
by
the
four
seconds
at
a
gunmaker
we
helped
you
to
a
chance
i
will
promise
you
horse
pistols
are
to
be
the
weapons
for
lucien
life
had
become
a
bad
dream
he
did
not
care
whether
he
lived
or
died
the
courage
of
suicide
helped
him
in
some
sort
to
carry
things
off
with
a
dash
of
bravado
before
the
spectators
he
stood
in
his
place
he
would
not
take
a
step
a
piece
of
recklessness
which
the
others
took
for
deliberate
calculation
they
thought
the
poet
an
uncommonly
cool
hand
michel
chrestien
came
as
far
as
his
limit
both
fired
twice
and
at
the
same
time
for
either
party
was
considered
to
be
equally
insulted
michel
first
bullet
grazed
lucien
chin
lucien
passed
ten
feet
above
chrestien
head
the
second
shot
hit
lucien
coat
collar
but
the
buckram
lining
fortunately
saved
its
wearer
the
third
bullet
struck
him
in
the
chest
and
he
dropped
is
he
dead
asked
michel
chrestien
no
said
the
surgeon
he
will
pull
through
so
much
the
worse
answered
michel
yes
so
much
the
worse
said
lucien
as
his
tears
fell
fast
by
noon
the
unhappy
boy
lay
in
bed
in
his
own
room
with
untold
pains
they
had
managed
to
remove
him
but
it
had
taken
five
hours
to
bring
him
to
the
rue
de
la
lune
his
condition
was
not
dangerous
but
precautions
were
necessary
lest
fever
should
set
in
and
bring
about
troublesome
complications
coralie
choked
down
her
grief
and
anguish
she
sat
up
with
him
at
night
through
the
anxious
weeks
of
his
illness
studying
her
parts
by
his
bedside
lucien
was
in
danger
for
two
long
months
and
often
at
the
theatre
coralie
acted
her
frivolous
role
with
one
thought
in
her
heart
perhaps
he
is
dying
at
this
moment
lucien
owed
his
life
to
the
skill
and
devotion
of
a
friend
whom
he
had
grievously
hurt
bianchon
had
come
to
tend
him
after
hearing
the
story
of
the
attack
from
who
told
it
in
confidence
and
excused
the
unhappy
poet
bianchon
suspected
that
was
generously
trying
to
screen
the
renegade
but
on
questioning
lucien
during
a
lucid
interval
in
the
dangerous
nervous
fever
he
learned
that
his
patient
was
only
responsible
for
the
one
serious
article
in
hector
merlin
paper
before
the
first
month
was
out
the
firm
of
fendant
and
cavalier
filed
their
schedule
bianchon
told
coralie
that
lucien
must
on
no
account
hear
the
news
the
famous
of
charles
brought
out
with
an
absurd
title
had
been
a
complete
failure
fendant
being
anxious
to
realize
a
little
ready
money
before
going
into
bankruptcy
had
sold
the
whole
edition
without
cavalier
knowledge
to
dealers
in
printed
paper
these
in
their
turn
had
disposed
of
it
at
a
cheap
rate
to
hawkers
and
lucien
book
at
that
moment
was
adorning
the
bookstalls
along
the
quays
the
booksellers
on
the
quai
des
augustins
who
had
previously
taken
a
quantity
of
copies
now
discovered
that
after
this
sudden
reduction
of
the
price
they
were
like
to
lose
heavily
on
their
purchases
the
four
duodecimo
volumes
for
which
they
had
paid
four
francs
fifty
centimes
were
being
given
away
for
fifty
sous
great
was
the
outcry
in
the
trade
but
the
newspapers
preserved
a
profound
silence
barbet
had
not
foreseen
this
clearance
he
had
a
belief
in
lucien
abilities
for
once
he
had
broken
his
rule
and
taken
two
hundred
copies
the
prospect
of
a
loss
drove
him
frantic
the
things
he
said
of
lucien
were
fearful
to
hear
then
barbet
took
a
heroic
resolution
he
stocked
his
copies
in
a
corner
of
his
shop
with
the
obstinacy
of
greed
and
left
his
competitors
to
sell
their
wares
at
a
loss
two
years
afterwards
when
fine
preface
the
merits
of
the
book
and
one
or
two
articles
by
leon
giraud
had
raised
the
value
of
the
book
barbet
sold
his
copies
one
by
one
at
ten
francs
each
lucien
knew
nothing
of
all
this
but
berenice
and
coralie
could
not
refuse
to
allow
hector
merlin
to
see
his
dying
comrade
and
hector
merlin
made
him
drink
drop
by
drop
the
whole
of
the
bitter
draught
brewed
by
the
failure
of
fendant
and
cavalier
made
bankrupts
by
his
first
book
martainville
the
one
friend
who
stood
by
lucien
through
thick
and
thin
had
written
a
magnificent
article
on
his
work
but
so
great
was
the
general
exasperation
against
the
editor
of
and
drapeau
that
his
championship
only
injured
lucien
in
vain
did
the
athlete
return
the
liberal
insults
tenfold
not
a
newspaper
took
up
the
challenge
in
spite
of
all
his
attacks
coralie
berenice
and
bianchon
might
shut
the
door
on
friends
who
raised
a
great
outcry
but
it
was
impossible
to
keep
out
creditors
and
writs
after
the
failure
of
fendant
and
cavalier
their
bills
were
taken
into
bankruptcy
according
to
that
provision
of
the
code
of
commerce
most
inimical
to
the
claims
of
third
parties
who
in
this
way
lose
the
benefit
of
delay
lucien
discovered
that
camusot
was
proceeding
against
him
with
great
energy
when
coralie
heard
the
name
and
for
the
first
time
learned
the
dreadful
and
humiliating
step
which
her
poet
had
taken
for
her
sake
the
angelic
creature
loved
him
ten
times
more
than
before
and
would
not
approach
camusot
the
bailiff
bringing
the
warrant
of
arrest
shrank
back
from
the
idea
of
dragging
his
prisoner
out
of
bed
and
went
back
to
camusot
before
applying
to
the
president
of
the
tribunal
of
commerce
for
an
order
to
remove
the
debtor
to
a
private
hospital
camusot
hurried
at
once
to
the
rue
de
la
lune
and
coralie
went
down
to
him
when
she
came
up
again
she
held
the
warrants
in
which
lucien
was
described
as
a
tradesman
in
her
hand
how
had
she
obtained
those
papers
from
camusot
what
promise
had
she
given
coralie
kept
a
sad
gloomy
silence
but
when
she
returned
she
looked
as
if
all
the
life
had
gone
out
of
her
she
played
in
camille
maupin
play
and
contributed
not
a
little
to
the
success
of
that
illustrious
literary
hermaphrodite
but
the
creation
of
this
character
was
the
last
flicker
of
a
bright
dying
lamp
on
the
twentieth
night
when
lucien
had
so
far
recovered
that
he
had
regained
his
appetite
and
could
walk
abroad
and
talked
of
getting
to
work
again
coralie
broke
down
a
secret
trouble
was
weighing
upon
her
berenice
always
believed
that
she
had
promised
to
go
back
to
camusot
to
save
lucien
another
mortification
followed
coralie
was
obliged
to
see
her
part
given
to
florine
nathan
had
threatened
the
gymnase
with
war
if
the
management
refused
to
give
the
vacant
place
to
coralie
rival
coralie
had
persisted
till
she
could
play
no
longer
knowing
that
florine
was
waiting
to
step
into
her
place
she
had
overtasked
her
strength
the
gymnase
had
advanced
sums
during
lucien
illness
she
had
no
money
to
draw
lucien
eager
to
work
though
he
was
was
not
yet
strong
enough
to
write
and
he
helped
besides
to
nurse
coralie
and
to
relieve
berenice
from
poverty
they
had
come
to
utter
distress
but
in
bianchon
they
found
a
skilful
and
devoted
doctor
who
obtained
credit
for
them
of
the
druggist
the
landlord
of
the
house
and
the
tradespeople
knew
by
this
time
how
matters
stood
the
furniture
was
attached
the
tailor
and
dressmaker
no
longer
stood
in
awe
of
the
journalist
and
proceeded
to
extremes
and
at
last
no
one
with
the
exception
of
the
and
the
druggist
gave
the
two
unlucky
children
credit
for
a
week
or
more
all
three
of
them
lucien
berenice
and
the
invalid
were
obliged
to
live
on
the
various
ingenious
preparations
sold
by
the
the
inflammatory
diet
was
little
suited
to
the
sick
girl
and
coralie
grew
worse
sheer
want
compelled
lucien
to
ask
lousteau
for
a
return
of
the
loan
of
a
thousand
francs
lost
at
play
by
the
friend
who
had
deserted
him
in
his
hour
of
need
perhaps
amid
all
his
troubles
this
step
cost
him
most
cruel
suffering
lousteau
was
not
to
be
found
in
the
rue
de
la
harpe
hunted
down
like
a
hare
he
was
lodging
now
with
this
friend
now
with
that
lucien
found
him
at
last
at
flicoteaux
he
was
sitting
at
the
very
table
at
which
lucien
had
found
him
that
evening
when
for
his
misfortune
he
forsook
for
journalism
lousteau
offered
him
dinner
and
lucien
accepted
the
offer
as
they
came
out
of
flicoteaux
with
claude
vignon
who
happened
to
be
dining
there
that
day
and
the
great
man
in
obscurity
who
kept
his
wardrobe
at
samanon
the
four
among
them
could
not
produce
enough
specie
to
pay
for
a
cup
of
coffee
at
the
cafe
voltaire
they
lounged
about
the
luxembourg
in
the
hope
of
meeting
with
a
publisher
and
as
it
fell
out
they
met
with
one
of
the
most
famous
printers
of
the
day
lousteau
borrowed
forty
francs
of
him
and
divided
the
money
into
four
equal
parts
misery
had
brought
down
lucien
pride
and
extinguished
sentiment
he
shed
tears
as
he
told
the
story
of
his
troubles
but
each
one
of
his
comrades
had
a
tale
as
cruel
as
his
own
and
when
the
three
versions
had
been
given
it
seemed
to
the
poet
that
he
was
the
least
unfortunate
among
the
four
all
of
them
craved
a
respite
from
remembrance
and
thoughts
which
made
trouble
doubly
hard
to
bear
lousteau
hurried
to
the
palais
royal
to
gamble
with
his
remaining
nine
francs
the
great
man
unknown
to
fame
though
he
had
a
divine
mistress
must
needs
hie
him
to
a
low
haunt
of
vice
to
wallow
in
perilous
pleasure
vignon
betook
himself
to
the
de
to
drown
memory
and
thought
in
a
couple
of
bottles
of
bordeaux
lucien
parted
company
with
him
on
the
threshold
declining
to
share
that
supper
when
he
shook
hands
with
the
one
journalist
who
had
not
been
hostile
to
him
it
was
with
a
cruel
pang
in
his
heart
what
shall
i
do
he
asked
aloud
one
must
do
as
one
can
the
great
critic
said
your
book
is
good
but
it
excited
jealousy
and
your
struggle
will
be
hard
and
long
genius
is
a
cruel
disease
every
writer
carries
a
canker
in
his
heart
a
devouring
monster
like
the
tapeworm
in
the
stomach
which
destroys
all
feeling
as
it
arises
in
him
which
is
the
stronger
the
man
or
the
disease
one
has
need
be
a
great
man
truly
to
keep
the
balance
between
genius
and
character
the
talent
grows
the
heart
withers
unless
a
man
is
a
giant
unless
he
has
the
thews
of
a
hercules
he
must
be
content
either
to
lose
his
gift
or
to
live
without
a
heart
you
are
slender
and
fragile
you
will
give
way
he
added
as
he
turned
into
the
restaurant
lucien
returned
home
thinking
over
that
terrible
verdict
he
beheld
the
life
of
literature
by
the
light
of
the
profound
truths
uttered
by
vignon
money
money
a
voice
cried
in
his
ears
then
he
drew
three
bills
of
a
thousand
francs
each
due
respectively
in
one
two
and
three
months
imitating
the
handwriting
of
his
david
sechard
with
admirable
skill
he
endorsed
the
bills
and
took
them
next
morning
to
metivier
the
in
the
rue
serpente
who
made
no
difficulty
about
taking
them
lucien
wrote
a
few
lines
to
give
his
notice
of
this
assault
upon
his
promising
as
usual
in
such
cases
to
be
ready
to
meet
the
bills
as
they
fell
due
when
all
debts
his
own
and
coralie
were
paid
he
put
the
three
hundred
francs
which
remained
into
berenice
hands
bidding
her
to
refuse
him
money
if
he
asked
her
for
it
he
was
afraid
of
a
return
of
the
gambler
frenzy
lucien
worked
away
gloomily
in
a
sort
of
cold
speechless
fury
putting
forth
all
his
powers
into
witty
articles
written
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
at
coralie
bedside
whenever
he
looked
up
in
search
of
ideas
his
eyes
fell
on
that
beloved
face
white
as
porcelain
fair
with
the
beauty
that
belongs
to
the
dying
and
he
saw
a
smile
on
her
pale
lips
and
her
eyes
grown
bright
with
a
more
consuming
pain
than
physical
suffering
always
turned
on
his
face
lucien
sent
in
his
work
but
he
could
not
leave
the
house
to
worry
editors
and
his
articles
did
not
appear
when
he
at
last
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
the
office
he
met
with
a
cool
reception
from
theodore
gaillard
who
had
advanced
him
money
and
turned
his
literary
diamonds
to
good
account
afterwards
take
care
my
dear
fellow
you
are
falling
off
he
said
you
must
not
let
yourself
down
your
work
wants
inspiration
that
little
lucien
has
written
himself
out
with
his
romance
and
his
first
articles
cried
felicien
vernou
merlin
and
the
whole
chorus
of
his
enemies
whenever
his
name
came
up
at
dauriat
or
the
vaudeville
the
work
he
is
sending
us
is
pitiable
to
have
written
oneself
out
in
the
slang
of
journalism
is
a
verdict
very
hard
to
live
down
it
passed
everywhere
from
mouth
to
mouth
ruining
lucien
all
unsuspicious
as
he
was
and
indeed
his
burdens
were
too
heavy
for
his
strength
in
the
midst
of
a
heavy
strain
of
work
he
was
sued
for
the
bills
which
he
had
drawn
in
david
sechard
name
he
had
recourse
to
camusot
experience
and
sometime
adorer
was
generous
enough
to
assist
the
man
she
loved
the
intolerable
situation
lasted
for
two
whole
months
the
days
being
diversified
by
stamped
papers
handed
over
to
desroches
a
friend
of
bixiou
blondet
and
des
lupeaulx
early
in
august
bianchon
told
them
that
coralie
condition
was
hopeless
she
had
only
a
few
days
to
live
those
days
were
spent
in
tears
by
berenice
and
lucien
they
could
not
hide
their
grief
from
the
dying
girl
and
she
was
for
lucien
sake
some
strange
change
was
working
in
coralie
she
would
have
lucien
bring
a
priest
she
must
be
reconciled
to
the
church
and
die
in
peace
coralie
died
as
a
christian
her
repentance
was
sincere
her
agony
and
death
took
all
energy
and
heart
out
of
lucien
he
sank
into
a
low
chair
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
never
took
his
eyes
off
her
till
death
brought
the
end
of
her
suffering
it
was
five
in
the
morning
some
lighting
upon
a
on
the
twittered
a
few
notes
berenice
kneeling
by
the
bedside
was
covering
a
hand
fast
growing
cold
with
kisses
and
tears
on
the
there
lay
eleven
sous
lucien
went
out
despair
made
him
beg
for
money
to
lay
coralie
in
her
grave
he
had
wild
thoughts
of
flinging
himself
at
the
marquise
feet
of
entreating
the
comte
du
chatelet
mme
de
bargeton
mlle
des
touches
nay
that
terrible
dandy
of
a
de
marsay
all
his
pride
had
gone
with
his
strength
he
would
have
enlisted
as
a
common
soldier
at
that
moment
for
money
he
walked
on
with
a
slouching
feverish
gait
known
to
all
the
unhappy
reached
camille
maupin
house
entered
careless
of
his
disordered
dress
and
sent
in
a
message
he
entreated
mlle
des
touches
to
see
him
for
a
moment
mademoiselle
only
went
to
bed
at
three
this
morning
said
the
servant
and
no
one
would
dare
to
disturb
her
until
she
rings
when
does
she
ring
never
before
ten
then
lucien
wrote
one
of
those
harrowing
appeals
in
which
the
beggar
flings
all
pride
and
to
the
winds
one
evening
not
so
very
long
ago
when
lousteau
had
told
him
of
the
abject
begging
letters
which
finot
received
lucien
had
thought
it
impossible
that
any
creature
would
sink
so
low
and
now
carried
away
by
his
pen
he
had
gone
further
it
may
be
than
other
unlucky
wretches
upon
the
same
road
he
did
not
suspect
in
his
fever
and
imbecility
that
he
had
just
written
a
masterpiece
of
pathos
on
his
way
home
along
the
boulevards
he
met
barbet
barbet
he
begged
holding
out
his
hand
five
hundred
francs
no
two
hundred
returned
the
other
ah
then
you
have
a
heart
yes
but
i
am
a
man
of
business
as
well
i
have
lost
a
lot
of
money
through
you
he
concluded
after
giving
the
history
of
the
failure
of
fendant
and
cavalier
will
you
put
me
in
the
way
of
making
some
lucien
quivered
you
are
a
poet
you
ought
to
understand
all
kinds
of
poetry
continued
the
little
publisher
i
want
a
few
rollicking
songs
at
this
moment
to
put
along
with
some
more
by
different
authors
or
they
will
be
down
upon
me
over
the
copyright
i
want
to
have
a
good
collection
to
sell
on
the
streets
at
ten
sous
if
you
care
to
let
me
have
ten
good
by
morning
or
something
spicy
you
know
the
sort
of
thing
eh
i
will
pay
you
two
hundred
francs
when
lucien
returned
home
he
found
coralie
stretched
out
straight
and
stiff
on
a
berenice
with
many
tears
had
wrapped
her
in
a
coarse
linen
sheet
and
put
lighted
candles
at
the
four
corners
of
the
bed
coralie
face
had
taken
that
strange
delicate
beauty
of
death
which
so
vividly
impresses
the
living
with
the
idea
of
absolute
calm
she
looked
like
some
white
girl
in
a
decline
it
seemed
as
if
those
pale
crimson
lips
must
open
and
murmur
the
name
which
had
blended
with
the
name
of
god
in
the
last
words
that
she
uttered
before
she
died
lucien
told
berenice
to
order
a
funeral
which
should
not
cost
more
than
two
hundred
francs
including
the
service
at
the
shabby
little
church
of
the
as
soon
as
she
had
gone
out
he
sat
down
to
a
table
and
beside
the
dead
body
of
his
love
he
composed
ten
rollicking
songs
to
fit
popular
airs
the
effort
cost
him
untold
anguish
but
at
last
the
brain
began
to
work
at
the
bidding
of
necessity
as
if
suffering
were
not
and
already
lucien
had
learned
to
put
claude
vignon
terrible
maxims
in
practice
and
to
raise
a
barrier
between
heart
and
brain
what
a
night
the
poor
boy
spent
over
those
drinking
songs
writing
by
the
light
of
the
tall
wax
candles
while
the
priest
recited
the
prayers
for
the
dead
morning
broke
before
the
last
song
was
finished
lucien
tried
it
over
to
a
of
the
day
to
the
consternation
of
berenice
and
the
priest
who
thought
that
he
was
mad
lads
is
tedious
waste
of
time
to
mingle
song
and
reason
folly
calls
for
laughing
rhyme
sense
is
out
of
season
let
apollo
be
forgot
when
bacchus
fills
the
any
catch
is
good
i
wot
if
good
fellows
take
it
up
let
philosophers
protest
let
us
laugh
and
quaff
and
a
fig
for
the
rest
as
hippocrates
has
said
every
jolly
fellow
when
a
century
has
sped
still
is
fit
and
mellow
no
more
following
of
a
lass
with
the
palsy
in
your
legs
while
your
hand
can
hold
a
glass
you
can
drain
it
to
the
dregs
with
an
undiminished
zest
let
us
laugh
and
quaff
and
a
fig
for
the
rest
whence
we
come
we
know
full
well
whiter
are
we
going
a
one
of
us
can
tell
is
a
thing
past
knowing
faith
what
does
it
signify
take
the
good
that
heaven
sends
it
is
certain
that
we
die
certain
that
we
live
my
friends
life
is
nothing
but
a
jest
let
us
laugh
and
quaff
and
a
fig
for
the
rest
he
was
shouting
the
reckless
refrain
when
and
bianchon
arrived
to
find
him
in
a
paroxysm
of
despair
and
exhaustion
utterly
unable
to
make
a
fair
copy
of
his
verses
a
torrent
of
tears
followed
and
when
amid
his
sobs
he
had
told
his
story
he
saw
the
tears
standing
in
his
friends
eyes
this
wipes
out
many
sins
said
happy
are
they
who
suffer
for
their
sins
in
this
world
the
priest
said
solemnly
at
the
sight
of
the
fair
dead
face
smiling
at
eternity
while
coralie
lover
wrote
to
buy
a
grave
for
her
and
barbet
paid
for
the
coffin
of
the
four
candles
lighted
about
the
dead
body
of
her
who
had
thrilled
a
great
audience
as
she
stood
behind
the
footlights
in
her
spanish
basquina
and
scarlet
stockings
while
beyond
in
the
doorway
stood
the
priest
who
had
reconciled
the
dying
actress
with
god
now
about
to
return
to
the
church
to
say
a
mass
for
the
soul
of
her
who
had
loved
much
all
the
grandeur
and
the
sordid
aspects
of
the
scene
all
that
sorrow
crushed
under
by
necessity
froze
the
blood
of
the
great
writer
and
the
great
doctor
they
sat
down
neither
of
them
could
utter
a
word
just
at
that
moment
a
servant
in
livery
announced
mlle
des
touches
that
beautiful
and
noble
woman
understood
everything
at
once
she
stepped
quickly
across
the
room
to
lucien
and
slipped
two
notes
into
his
hand
as
she
grasped
it
it
is
too
late
he
said
looking
up
at
her
with
dull
hopeless
eyes
the
three
stayed
with
lucien
trying
to
soothe
his
despair
with
comforting
words
but
every
spring
seemed
to
be
broken
at
noon
all
the
brotherhood
with
the
exception
of
michel
chrestien
who
however
had
learned
the
truth
as
to
lucien
treachery
was
assembled
in
the
poor
little
church
of
the
mlle
de
touches
was
present
and
berenice
and
coralie
dresser
from
the
theatre
with
a
couple
of
supernumeraries
and
the
disconsolate
camusot
all
the
men
accompanied
the
actress
to
her
last
in
pere
lachaise
camusot
shedding
hot
tears
had
solemnly
promised
lucien
to
buy
the
grave
in
perpetuity
and
to
put
a
headstone
above
it
with
the
words
coralie
aged
nineteen
years
august
lucien
stayed
there
on
the
sloping
ground
that
looks
out
over
paris
until
the
sun
had
set
who
will
love
me
now
he
thought
my
truest
friends
despise
me
whatever
i
might
have
done
she
who
lies
here
would
have
thought
me
wholly
noble
and
good
i
have
no
one
left
to
me
now
but
my
sister
and
mother
and
david
and
what
do
they
think
of
me
at
home
poor
distinguished
provincial
he
went
back
to
the
rue
de
la
lune
but
the
sight
of
the
rooms
was
so
acutely
painful
that
he
could
not
stay
in
them
and
he
took
a
cheap
lodging
elsewhere
in
the
same
street
mlle
des
touches
two
thousand
francs
and
the
sale
of
the
furniture
paid
the
debts
berenice
had
two
hundred
francs
left
on
which
they
lived
for
two
months
lucien
was
prostrate
he
could
neither
write
nor
think
he
gave
way
to
morbid
grief
berenice
took
pity
upon
him
suppose
that
you
were
to
go
back
to
your
own
country
how
are
you
to
get
there
she
asked
one
day
by
way
of
reply
to
an
exclamation
of
lucien
on
foot
but
even
so
you
must
live
and
sleep
on
the
way
even
if
you
walk
twelve
leagues
a
day
you
will
want
twenty
francs
at
least
i
will
get
them
together
he
said
he
took
his
clothes
and
his
best
linen
keeping
nothing
but
strict
necessaries
and
went
to
samanon
who
offered
fifty
francs
for
his
entire
wardrobe
in
vain
he
begged
the
to
let
him
have
enough
to
pay
his
fare
by
the
coach
samanon
was
inexorable
in
a
paroxysm
of
fury
lucien
rushed
to
frascati
staked
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
and
lost
every
farthing
back
once
more
in
the
wretched
room
in
the
rue
de
la
lune
he
asked
berenice
for
coralie
shawl
the
good
girl
looked
at
him
and
knew
in
a
moment
what
he
meant
to
do
he
had
confessed
to
his
loss
at
the
and
now
he
was
going
to
hang
himself
are
you
mad
sir
go
out
for
a
walk
and
come
back
again
at
midnight
i
will
get
the
money
for
you
but
keep
to
the
boulevards
do
not
go
towards
the
quais
lucien
paced
up
and
down
the
boulevards
he
was
stupid
with
grief
he
watched
the
and
the
stream
of
traffic
and
felt
that
he
was
alone
and
a
very
small
atom
in
this
seething
whirlpool
of
paris
churned
by
the
strife
of
innumerable
interests
his
thoughts
went
back
to
the
banks
of
his
charente
a
craving
for
happiness
and
home
awoke
in
him
and
with
the
craving
came
one
of
the
sudden
febrile
bursts
of
energy
which
natures
like
his
mistake
for
strength
he
would
not
give
up
until
he
had
poured
out
his
heart
to
david
sechard
and
taken
counsel
of
the
three
good
angels
still
left
to
him
on
earth
as
he
lounged
along
he
caught
sight
of
berenice
berenice
in
her
sunday
clothes
speaking
to
a
stranger
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
lune
and
the
filthy
boulevard
where
she
had
taken
her
stand
what
are
you
doing
asked
lucien
dismayed
by
a
sudden
suspicion
here
are
your
twenty
francs
said
the
girl
slipping
four
pieces
into
the
poet
hand
they
may
cost
dear
yet
but
you
can
go
and
she
had
fled
before
lucien
could
see
the
way
she
went
for
in
justice
to
him
it
must
be
said
that
the
money
burned
his
hand
he
wanted
to
return
it
but
he
was
forced
to
keep
it
as
the
final
brand
set
upon
him

life

eve
and

part
iii
by
honore
de
balzac
translated
by
ellen
marriage
lucien
had
gone
to
paris
and
david
sechard
with
the
courage
and
intelligence
of
the
ox
which
painters
give
the
evangelist
for
accompanying
symbol
set
himself
to
make
the
large
fortune
for
which
he
had
wished
that
evening
down
by
the
charente
when
he
sat
with
eve
by
the
weir
and
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
her
heart
he
wanted
to
make
the
money
quickly
and
less
for
himself
than
for
eve
sake
and
lucien
he
would
place
his
wife
amid
the
elegant
and
comfortable
surroundings
that
were
hers
by
right
and
his
strong
arm
should
sustain
her
brother
ambitions
this
was
the
programme
that
he
saw
before
his
eyes
in
letters
of
fire
journalism
and
politics
the
immense
development
of
the
book
trade
of
literature
and
of
the
sciences
the
increase
of
public
interest
in
matters
touching
the
various
industries
in
the
country
in
fact
the
whole
social
tendency
of
the
epoch
following
the
establishment
of
the
restoration
produced
an
enormous
increase
in
the
demand
for
paper
the
supply
required
was
almost
ten
times
as
large
as
the
quantity
in
which
the
celebrated
ouvrard
speculated
at
the
outset
of
the
revolution
then
ouvrard
could
buy
up
first
the
entire
stock
of
paper
and
then
the
manufacturers
but
in
the
year
there
were
so
many
in
france
that
no
one
could
hope
to
repeat
his
success
and
david
had
neither
audacity
enough
nor
capital
enough
for
such
speculation
machinery
for
producing
paper
in
any
length
was
just
coming
into
use
in
england
it
was
one
of
the
most
urgent
needs
of
the
time
therefore
that
the
paper
trade
should
keep
pace
with
the
requirements
of
the
french
system
of
civil
government
a
system
by
which
the
right
of
discussion
was
to
be
extended
to
every
man
and
the
whole
fabric
based
upon
continual
expression
of
individual
opinion
a
grave
misfortune
for
the
nation
that
deliberates
is
but
little
wont
to
act
so
strange
coincidence
while
lucien
was
drawn
into
the
great
machinery
of
journalism
where
he
was
like
to
leave
his
honor
and
his
intelligence
torn
to
shreds
david
sechard
at
the
back
of
his
foresaw
all
the
practical
consequences
of
the
increased
activity
of
the
periodical
press
he
saw
the
direction
in
which
the
spirit
of
the
age
was
tending
and
sought
to
find
means
to
the
required
end
he
saw
also
that
there
was
a
fortune
awaiting
the
discoverer
of
cheap
paper
and
the
event
has
justified
his
clearsightedness
within
the
last
fifteen
years
the
patent
office
has
received
more
than
a
hundred
applications
from
persons
claiming
to
have
discovered
cheap
substances
to
be
employed
in
the
manufacture
of
paper
david
felt
more
than
ever
convinced
that
this
would
be
no
brilliant
triumph
it
is
true
but
a
useful
and
immensely
profitable
discovery
and
after
his
went
to
paris
he
became
more
and
more
absorbed
in
the
problem
which
he
had
set
himself
to
solve
the
expenses
of
his
marriage
and
of
lucien
journey
to
paris
had
exhausted
all
his
resources
he
confronted
the
extreme
of
poverty
at
the
very
outset
of
married
life
he
had
kept
one
thousand
francs
for
the
working
expenses
of
the
business
and
owed
a
like
sum
for
which
he
had
given
a
bill
to
postel
the
druggist
so
here
was
a
double
problem
for
this
deep
thinker
he
must
invent
a
method
of
making
cheap
paper
and
that
quickly
he
must
make
the
discovery
in
fact
in
order
to
apply
the
proceeds
to
the
needs
of
the
household
and
of
the
business
what
words
can
describe
the
brain
that
can
forget
the
cruel
preoccupations
caused
by
hidden
want
by
the
daily
needs
of
a
family
and
the
daily
drudgery
of
a
printer
business
which
requires
such
minute
painstaking
care
and
soar
with
the
enthusiasm
and
intoxication
of
the
man
of
science
into
the
regions
of
the
unknown
in
quest
of
a
secret
which
daily
eludes
the
most
subtle
experiment
and
the
inventor
alas
as
will
shortly
be
seen
has
plenty
of
woes
to
endure
besides
the
ingratitude
of
the
many
idle
folk
that
can
do
nothing
themselves
tell
them
such
a
one
is
a
born
inventor
he
could
not
do
otherwise
he
no
more
deserves
credit
for
his
invention
than
a
prince
for
being
born
to
rule
he
is
simply
exercising
his
natural
faculties
and
his
work
is
its
own
reward
and
the
people
believe
them
marriage
brings
profound
mental
and
physical
perturbations
into
a
girl
life
and
if
she
marries
under
the
ordinary
conditions
of
lower
life
she
must
moreover
begin
to
study
totally
new
interests
and
initiate
herself
in
the
intricacies
of
business
with
marriage
therefore
she
enters
upon
a
phase
of
her
existence
when
she
is
necessarily
on
the
watch
before
she
can
act
unfortunately
love
for
his
wife
retarded
this
training
he
dared
not
tell
her
the
real
state
of
affairs
on
the
day
after
their
wedding
nor
for
some
time
afterwards
his
father
avarice
condemned
him
to
the
most
grinding
poverty
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
spoil
the
honeymoon
by
beginning
his
wife
commercial
education
and
prosaic
apprenticeship
to
his
laborious
craft
so
it
came
to
pass
that
housekeeping
no
less
than
working
expenses
ate
up
the
thousand
francs
his
whole
fortune
for
four
months
david
gave
no
thought
to
the
future
and
his
wife
remained
in
ignorance
the
awakening
was
terrible
postel
bill
fell
due
there
was
no
money
to
meet
it
and
eve
knew
enough
of
the
debt
and
its
cause
to
give
up
her
bridal
trinkets
and
silver
that
evening
eve
tried
to
induce
david
to
talk
of
their
affairs
for
she
had
noticed
that
he
was
giving
less
attention
to
the
business
and
more
to
the
problem
of
which
he
had
once
spoken
to
her
since
the
first
few
weeks
of
married
life
in
fact
david
spent
most
of
his
time
in
the
shed
in
the
backyard
in
the
little
room
where
he
was
wont
to
mould
his
three
months
after
his
return
to
angouleme
he
had
replaced
the
old
fashioned
round
by
rollers
made
of
strong
glue
and
treacle
and
an
on
which
the
ink
was
evenly
distributed
an
improvement
so
obvious
that
cointet
brothers
no
sooner
saw
it
than
they
adopted
the
plan
themselves
by
the
partition
wall
of
this
kitchen
as
it
were
david
had
set
up
a
little
furnace
with
a
copper
pan
ostensibly
to
save
the
cost
of
fuel
over
the
recasting
of
his
rollers
though
the
moulds
had
not
been
used
twice
and
hung
there
rusting
upon
the
wall
nor
was
this
all
a
solid
oak
door
had
been
put
in
by
his
orders
and
the
walls
were
lined
with
he
even
replaced
the
dirty
window
sash
by
panes
of
ribbed
glass
so
that
no
one
without
could
watch
him
at
his
work
when
eve
began
to
speak
about
the
future
he
looked
uneasily
at
her
and
cut
her
short
at
the
first
word
by
saying
i
know
all
that
you
must
think
child
when
you
see
that
the
workshop
is
left
to
itself
and
that
i
am
dead
as
it
were
to
all
business
interests
but
see
he
continued
bringing
her
to
the
window
and
pointing
to
the
mysterious
shed
there
lies
our
fortune
for
some
months
yet
we
must
endure
our
lot
but
let
us
bear
it
patiently
leave
me
to
solve
the
problem
of
which
i
told
you
and
all
our
troubles
will
be
at
an
end
david
was
so
good
his
devotion
was
so
thoroughly
to
be
taken
upon
his
word
that
the
poor
wife
with
a
wife
anxiety
as
to
daily
expenses
determined
to
spare
her
husband
the
household
cares
and
to
take
the
burden
upon
herself
so
she
came
down
from
the
pretty
room
where
she
sewed
and
talked
contentedly
with
her
mother
took
possession
of
one
of
the
two
dens
at
the
back
of
the
and
set
herself
to
learn
the
business
routine
of
typography
was
it
not
heroism
in
a
wife
who
expected
ere
long
to
be
a
mother
during
the
past
few
months
david
workmen
had
left
him
one
by
one
there
was
not
enough
work
for
them
to
do
cointet
brothers
on
the
other
hand
were
overwhelmed
with
orders
they
were
employing
all
the
workmen
of
the
department
the
alluring
prospect
of
high
wages
even
brought
them
a
few
from
bordeaux
more
especially
apprentices
who
thought
themselves
sufficiently
expert
to
cancel
their
articles
and
go
elsewhere
when
eve
came
to
look
into
the
affairs
of
printing
works
she
discovered
that
he
employed
three
persons
in
all
first
in
order
stood
cerizet
an
apprentice
of
didot
whom
david
had
chosen
to
train
most
foremen
have
some
one
favorite
among
the
great
numbers
of
workers
under
them
and
david
had
brought
cerizet
to
angouleme
where
he
had
been
learning
more
of
the
business
marion
as
much
attached
to
the
house
as
a
was
the
second
and
the
third
was
kolb
an
alsacien
at
one
time
a
porter
in
the
employ
of
the
didot
kolb
had
been
drawn
for
military
service
chance
brought
him
to
angouleme
and
david
recognized
the
man
face
at
a
review
just
as
his
time
was
about
to
expire
kolb
came
to
see
david
and
was
smitten
forthwith
by
the
charms
of
the
portly
marion
she
possessed
all
the
qualities
which
a
man
of
his
class
looks
for
in
a
wife
the
robust
health
that
bronzes
the
cheeks
the
strength
of
a
man
marion
could
lift
a
form
of
type
with
ease
the
scrupulous
honesty
on
which
an
alsacien
sets
such
store
the
faithful
service
which
bespeaks
a
sterling
character
and
finally
the
thrift
which
had
saved
a
little
sum
of
a
thousand
francs
besides
a
stock
of
clothing
and
linen
neat
and
clean
as
country
linen
can
be
marion
herself
a
big
stout
woman
of
felt
sufficiently
flattered
by
the
admiration
of
a
cuirassier
who
stood
five
feet
seven
in
his
stockings
a
warrior
strong
as
a
bastion
and
not
unnaturally
suggested
that
he
should
become
a
printer
so
by
the
time
kolb
received
his
full
discharge
marion
and
david
between
them
had
transformed
him
into
a
tolerably
creditable
bear
though
their
pupil
could
neither
read
nor
write
job
printing
as
it
is
called
was
not
so
abundant
at
this
season
but
that
cerizet
could
manage
it
without
help
cerizet
compositor
clicker
and
foreman
realized
in
his
person
the
phenomenal
triplicity
of
kant
he
set
up
type
read
proof
took
orders
and
made
out
invoices
but
the
most
part
of
the
time
he
had
nothing
to
do
and
used
to
read
novels
in
his
den
at
the
back
of
the
workshop
while
he
waited
for
an
order
for
a
or
a
trade
circular
marion
trained
by
old
sechard
prepared
and
wetted
down
the
paper
helped
kolb
with
the
printing
hung
the
sheets
to
dry
and
cut
them
to
size
yet
cooked
the
dinner
none
the
less
and
did
her
marketing
very
early
of
a
morning
eve
told
cerizet
to
draw
out
a
for
the
last
six
months
and
found
that
the
gross
receipts
amounted
to
eight
hundred
francs
on
the
other
hand
wages
at
the
rate
of
three
francs
per
day
two
francs
to
cerizet
and
one
to
kolb
reached
a
total
of
six
hundred
francs
and
as
the
goods
supplied
for
the
work
printed
and
delivered
amounted
to
some
hundred
odd
francs
it
was
clear
to
eve
that
david
had
been
carrying
on
business
at
a
loss
during
the
first
of
their
married
life
there
was
nothing
to
show
for
rent
nothing
for
wages
nor
for
the
interest
on
capital
represented
by
the
plant
the
license
and
the
ink
nothing
finally
by
way
of
allowance
for
the
host
of
things
included
in
the
technical
expression
wear
and
tear
a
word
which
owes
its
origin
to
the
cloths
and
silks
which
are
used
to
moderate
the
force
of
the
impression
and
to
save
wear
to
the
type
a
square
of
stuff
the
being
placed
between
the
platen
and
the
sheet
of
paper
in
the
press
eve
made
a
rough
calculation
of
the
resources
of
the
printing
office
and
of
the
output
and
saw
how
little
hope
there
was
for
a
business
drained
dry
by
the
activity
of
the
brothers
cointet
for
by
this
time
the
cointets
were
not
only
contract
printers
to
the
town
and
the
prefecture
and
printers
to
the
diocese
by
special
appointment
they
were
and
proprietors
of
a
newspaper
to
boot
that
newspaper
sold
two
years
ago
by
the
sechards
father
and
son
for
thousand
francs
was
now
bringing
in
eighteen
thousand
francs
per
annum
eve
began
to
understand
the
motives
lurking
beneath
the
apparent
generosity
of
the
brothers
cointet
they
were
leaving
the
sechard
establishment
just
sufficient
work
to
gain
a
pittance
but
not
enough
to
establish
a
rival
house
when
eve
took
the
management
of
the
business
she
began
by
taking
stock
she
set
kolb
and
marion
and
cerizet
to
work
and
the
workshop
was
put
to
rights
cleaned
out
and
set
in
order
then
one
evening
when
david
came
in
from
a
country
excursion
followed
by
an
old
woman
with
a
huge
bundle
tied
up
in
a
cloth
eve
asked
counsel
of
him
as
to
the
best
way
of
turning
to
profit
the
odds
and
ends
left
them
by
old
sechard
promising
that
she
herself
would
look
after
the
business
acting
upon
her
husband
advice
mme
sechard
sorted
all
the
remnants
of
paper
which
she
found
and
printed
old
popular
legends
in
double
columns
upon
a
single
sheet
such
as
peasants
paste
on
their
walls
the
histories
of
wandering
the
belle
and
sundry
miracles
eve
sent
kolb
out
as
a
hawker
cerizet
had
not
a
moment
to
spare
now
he
was
composing
the
naive
pages
with
the
rough
cuts
that
adorned
them
from
morning
to
night
marion
was
able
to
manage
the
taking
off
and
all
domestic
cares
fell
to
mme
chardon
for
eve
was
busy
coloring
the
prints
thanks
to
kolb
activity
and
honesty
eve
sold
three
thousand
broad
sheets
at
a
penny
apiece
and
made
three
hundred
francs
in
all
at
a
cost
of
thirty
francs
but
when
every
peasant
hut
and
every
little
for
twenty
leagues
round
was
papered
with
these
legends
a
fresh
speculation
must
be
discovered
the
alsacien
could
not
go
beyond
the
limits
of
the
department
eve
turning
over
everything
in
the
whole
printing
house
had
found
a
collection
of
figures
for
printing
a
calendar
a
kind
of
almanac
meant
for
those
who
can
not
read
letterpress
being
replaced
by
symbols
signs
and
pictures
in
colored
inks
red
black
and
blue
old
sechard
who
could
neither
read
nor
write
himself
had
made
a
good
deal
of
money
at
one
time
by
bringing
out
an
almanac
in
hieroglyph
it
was
in
book
form
a
single
sheet
folded
to
make
one
hundred
and
pages
thoroughly
satisfied
with
the
success
of
the
broad
sheets
a
piece
of
business
only
undertaken
by
country
printing
offices
mme
sechard
invested
all
the
proceeds
in
the
and
began
it
upon
a
large
scale
millions
of
copies
of
this
work
are
sold
annually
in
france
it
is
printed
upon
even
coarser
paper
than
the
of
a
ream
five
hundred
sheets
costing
in
the
first
instance
about
four
francs
while
the
printed
sheets
sell
at
the
rate
of
a
halfpenny
apiece
francs
per
ream
mme
sechard
determined
to
use
one
hundred
reams
for
the
first
impression
fifty
thousand
copies
would
bring
in
two
thousand
francs
a
man
so
deeply
absorbed
in
his
work
as
david
in
his
researches
is
seldom
observant
yet
david
taking
a
look
round
his
workshop
was
astonished
to
hear
the
groaning
of
a
press
and
to
see
cerizet
always
on
his
feet
setting
up
type
under
mme
sechard
direction
there
was
a
pretty
triumph
for
eve
on
the
day
when
david
came
in
to
see
what
she
was
doing
and
praised
the
idea
and
thought
the
calendar
an
excellent
stroke
of
business
furthermore
david
promised
to
give
advice
in
the
matter
of
colored
inks
for
an
almanac
meant
to
appeal
to
the
eye
and
finally
he
resolved
to
recast
the
himself
in
his
mysterious
workshop
so
as
to
help
his
wife
as
far
as
he
could
in
her
important
little
enterprise
but
just
as
the
work
began
with
strenuous
industry
there
came
letters
from
lucien
in
paris
letters
that
told
his
mother
and
sister
and
of
his
failure
and
distress
and
when
eve
mme
chardon
and
david
each
secretly
sent
money
to
their
poet
it
must
be
plain
to
the
reader
that
the
three
hundred
francs
they
sent
were
like
their
very
blood
the
overwhelming
news
the
disheartening
sense
that
work
as
bravely
as
she
might
she
made
so
little
left
eve
looking
forward
with
a
certain
dread
to
an
event
which
fills
the
cup
of
happiness
to
the
full
the
time
was
coming
very
near
now
and
to
herself
she
said
if
my
dear
david
has
not
reached
the
end
of
his
researches
before
my
confinement
what
will
become
of
us
and
who
will
look
after
our
poor
printing
office
and
the
business
that
is
growing
up
the
ought
by
rights
to
have
been
ready
before
the
of
january
but
cerizet
was
working
unaccountably
slowly
all
the
work
of
composing
fell
to
him
and
mme
sechard
knowing
so
little
could
not
find
fault
and
was
fain
to
content
herself
with
watching
the
young
parisian
cerizet
came
from
the
great
foundling
hospital
in
paris
he
had
been
apprenticed
to
the
mm
didot
and
between
the
ages
of
fourteen
and
seventeen
he
was
david
sechard
fanatical
worshiper
david
put
him
under
one
of
the
cleverest
workmen
and
took
him
for
his
his
page
cerizet
intelligence
naturally
interested
david
he
won
the
lad
affection
by
procuring
amusements
now
and
again
for
him
and
comforts
from
which
he
was
cut
off
by
poverty
nature
had
endowed
cerizet
with
an
insignificant
rather
pretty
little
countenance
red
hair
and
a
pair
of
dull
blue
eyes
he
had
come
to
angouleme
and
brought
the
manners
of
the
parisian
with
him
he
was
formidable
by
reason
of
a
quick
sarcastic
turn
and
a
spiteful
disposition
perhaps
david
looked
less
strictly
after
him
in
angouleme
or
perhaps
as
the
lad
grew
older
his
mentor
put
more
trust
in
him
or
in
the
sobering
influences
of
a
country
town
but
be
that
as
it
may
cerizet
all
unknown
to
his
sponsor
was
going
completely
to
the
bad
and
the
printer
apprentice
was
acting
the
part
of
a
don
juan
among
little
work
girls
his
morality
learned
in
paris
laid
down
the
law
of
as
the
sole
rule
of
guidance
he
knew
moreover
that
next
year
he
would
be
drawn
for
a
soldier
to
use
the
popular
expression
saw
that
he
had
no
prospects
and
ran
into
debt
thinking
that
soon
he
should
be
in
the
army
and
none
of
his
creditors
would
run
after
him
david
still
possessed
some
ascendency
over
the
young
fellow
due
not
to
his
position
as
master
nor
yet
to
the
interest
that
he
had
taken
in
his
pupil
but
to
the
great
intellectual
power
which
the
sometime
fully
recognized
before
long
cerizet
began
to
fraternize
with
the
cointets
workpeople
drawn
to
them
by
the
mutual
attraction
of
blouse
and
jacket
and
the
class
feeling
which
is
perhaps
strongest
of
all
in
the
lowest
ranks
of
society
in
their
company
cerizet
forgot
the
little
good
doctrine
which
david
had
managed
to
instil
into
him
but
nevertheless
when
the
others
joked
the
boy
about
the
presses
in
his
workshop
old
sabots
as
the
bears
contemptuously
called
them
and
showed
him
the
magnificent
machines
twelve
in
number
now
at
work
in
the
cointets
great
printing
office
where
the
single
wooden
press
was
only
used
for
experiments
cerizet
would
stand
up
for
david
and
fling
out
at
the
braggarts
my
gaffer
will
go
farther
with
his
than
yours
with
their
contrivances
that
turn
out
mass
books
all
day
long
he
would
boast
he
is
trying
to
find
out
a
secret
that
will
lick
all
the
printing
offices
in
france
and
navarre
and
meantime
you
take
your
orders
from
a
you
snip
of
a
foreman
on
two
francs
a
day
she
is
pretty
though
retorted
cerizet
it
is
better
to
have
her
to
look
at
than
the
phizes
of
your
gaffers
and
do
you
live
by
looking
at
his
wife
from
the
region
of
the
wineshop
or
from
the
door
of
the
printing
office
where
these
bickerings
took
place
a
dim
light
began
to
break
in
upon
the
brothers
cointet
as
to
the
real
state
of
things
in
the
sechard
establishment
they
came
to
hear
of
eve
experiment
and
held
it
expedient
to
stop
these
flights
at
once
lest
the
business
should
begin
to
prosper
under
the
poor
young
wife
management
let
us
give
her
a
rap
over
the
knuckles
and
disgust
her
with
the
business
said
the
brothers
cointet
one
of
the
pair
the
practical
printer
spoke
to
cerizet
and
asked
him
to
do
the
for
them
by
piecework
to
relieve
their
reader
who
had
more
than
he
could
manage
so
it
came
to
pass
that
cerizet
earned
more
by
a
few
hours
work
of
an
evening
for
the
brothers
cointet
than
by
a
whole
day
work
for
david
sechard
other
transactions
followed
the
cointets
seeing
no
small
aptitude
in
cerizet
he
was
told
that
it
was
a
pity
that
he
should
be
in
a
position
so
little
favorable
to
his
interests
you
might
be
foreman
some
day
in
a
big
printing
office
making
six
francs
a
day
said
one
of
the
cointets
one
day
and
with
your
intelligence
you
might
come
to
have
a
share
in
the
business
where
is
the
use
of
my
being
a
good
foreman
returned
cerizet
i
am
an
orphan
i
shall
be
drawn
for
the
army
next
year
and
if
i
get
a
bad
number
who
is
there
to
pay
some
one
else
to
take
my
place
if
you
make
yourself
useful
said
the
printer
why
should
not
somebody
advance
the
money
it
wo
be
my
gaffer
in
any
case
said
cerizet
pooh
perhaps
by
that
time
he
will
have
found
out
the
secret
the
words
were
spoken
in
a
way
that
could
not
but
rouse
the
worst
thoughts
in
the
listener
and
cerizet
gave
the
papermaker
and
printer
a
very
searching
look
i
do
not
know
what
he
is
busy
about
he
began
prudently
as
the
master
said
nothing
but
he
is
not
the
kind
of
man
to
look
for
capitals
in
the
lower
case
look
here
my
friend
said
the
printer
taking
up
sheets
of
the
diocesan
and
holding
them
out
to
cerizet
if
you
can
correct
these
for
us
by
you
shall
have
eighteen
francs
for
them
we
are
not
shabby
here
we
put
our
competitor
foreman
in
the
way
of
making
money
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
might
let
mme
sechard
go
too
far
to
draw
back
with
her
and
ruin
her
very
well
we
give
you
permission
to
tell
her
that
we
are
bringing
out
a
of
our
own
and
to
call
her
attention
too
to
the
fact
that
she
will
not
be
the
first
in
the
field
cerizet
motive
for
working
so
slowly
on
the
composition
of
the
almanac
should
be
clear
enough
by
this
time
when
eve
heard
that
the
cointets
meant
to
spoil
her
poor
little
speculation
dread
seized
upon
her
at
first
she
tried
to
see
a
proof
of
attachment
in
cerizet
hypocritical
warning
of
competition
but
before
long
she
saw
signs
of
an
curiosity
in
her
sole
compositor
the
curiosity
of
youth
she
tried
to
think
cerizet
she
said
one
morning
you
stand
about
on
the
threshold
and
wait
for
sechard
in
the
passage
to
pry
into
his
private
affairs
when
he
comes
out
into
the
yard
to
melt
down
the
rollers
you
are
there
looking
at
him
instead
of
getting
on
with
the
almanac
these
things
are
not
right
especially
when
you
see
that
i
his
wife
respect
his
secrets
and
take
so
much
trouble
on
myself
to
leave
him
free
to
give
himself
up
to
his
work
if
you
had
not
wasted
time
the
almanac
would
be
finished
by
now
and
kolb
would
be
selling
it
and
the
cointets
could
have
done
us
no
harm
eh
madame
answered
cerizet
here
am
i
doing
five
francs
worth
of
composing
for
two
francs
a
day
and
do
you
think
that
that
is
enough
why
if
i
did
not
read
proofs
of
an
evening
for
the
cointets
i
might
feed
myself
on
husks
you
are
turning
ungrateful
early
said
eve
deeply
hurt
not
so
much
by
cerizet
grumbling
as
by
his
coarse
tone
threatening
attitude
and
aggressive
stare
you
will
get
on
in
life
not
with
a
woman
to
order
me
about
though
for
it
is
not
often
that
the
month
has
thirty
days
in
it
then
feeling
wounded
in
her
womanly
dignity
eve
gave
cerizet
a
withering
look
and
went
upstairs
again
at
she
spoke
to
david
are
you
sure
dear
of
that
little
rogue
cerizet
cerizet
said
david
why
he
was
my
youngster
i
trained
him
i
took
him
on
as
my
i
put
him
to
composing
anything
that
he
is
he
owes
to
me
in
fact
you
might
as
well
ask
a
father
if
he
is
sure
of
his
child
upon
this
eve
told
her
husband
that
cerizet
was
reading
proofs
for
the
cointets
poor
fellow
he
must
live
said
david
humbled
by
the
consciousness
that
he
had
not
done
his
duty
as
a
master
yes
but
there
is
a
difference
dear
between
kolb
and
cerizet
kolb
tramps
about
twenty
leagues
every
day
spends
fifteen
or
twenty
sous
and
brings
us
back
seven
and
eight
and
sometimes
nine
francs
of
sales
and
when
his
expenses
are
paid
he
never
asks
for
more
than
his
wages
kolb
would
sooner
cut
off
his
hand
than
work
a
lever
for
the
cointets
kolb
would
not
peer
among
the
things
that
you
throw
out
into
the
yard
if
people
offered
him
a
thousand
crowns
to
do
it
but
cerizet
picks
them
up
and
looks
at
them
it
is
hard
for
noble
natures
to
think
evil
to
believe
in
ingratitude
only
through
rough
experience
do
they
learn
the
extent
of
human
corruption
and
even
when
there
is
nothing
left
them
to
learn
in
this
kind
they
rise
to
an
indulgence
which
is
the
last
degree
of
contempt
pooh
pure
paris
curiosity
cried
david
very
well
dear
do
me
the
pleasure
to
step
downstairs
and
look
at
the
work
done
by
this
boy
of
yours
and
tell
me
then
whether
he
ought
not
to
have
finished
our
almanac
this
month
david
went
into
the
workshop
after
dinner
and
saw
that
the
calendar
should
have
been
set
up
in
a
week
then
when
he
heard
that
the
cointets
were
bringing
out
a
similar
almanac
he
came
to
the
rescue
he
took
command
of
the
printing
office
kolb
helped
at
home
instead
of
selling
broadsheets
kolb
and
marion
pulled
off
the
impressions
from
one
form
while
david
worked
another
press
with
cerizet
and
superintended
the
printing
in
various
inks
every
sheet
must
be
printed
four
separate
times
for
which
reason
none
but
small
houses
will
attempt
to
produce
a
and
that
only
in
the
country
where
labor
is
cheap
and
the
amount
of
capital
employed
in
the
business
is
so
small
that
the
interest
amounts
to
little
wherefore
a
press
which
turns
out
beautiful
work
can
not
compete
in
the
printing
of
such
sheets
coarse
though
they
may
be
so
for
the
first
time
since
old
sechard
retired
two
presses
were
at
work
in
the
old
house
the
calendar
was
in
its
way
a
masterpiece
but
eve
was
obliged
to
sell
it
for
less
than
a
halfpenny
for
the
cointets
were
supplying
hawkers
at
the
rate
of
three
centimes
per
copy
eve
made
no
loss
on
the
copies
sold
to
hawkers
on
kolb
sales
made
directly
she
gained
but
her
little
speculation
was
spoiled
cerizet
saw
that
his
fair
employer
distrusted
him
in
his
own
conscience
he
posed
as
the
accuser
and
said
to
himself
you
suspect
me
do
you
i
will
have
my
revenge
for
the
paris
is
made
on
this
wise
cerizet
accordingly
took
pay
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
work
of
done
for
the
cointets
going
to
their
office
every
evening
for
the
sheets
and
returning
them
in
the
morning
he
came
to
be
on
familiar
terms
with
them
through
the
daily
chat
and
at
length
saw
a
chance
of
escaping
the
military
service
a
bait
held
out
to
him
by
the
brothers
so
far
from
requiring
prompting
from
the
cointets
he
was
the
first
to
propose
the
espionage
and
exploitation
of
david
researches
eve
saw
how
little
she
could
depend
upon
cerizet
and
to
find
another
kolb
was
simply
impossible
she
made
up
her
mind
to
dismiss
her
one
compositor
for
the
insight
of
a
woman
who
loves
told
her
that
cerizet
was
a
traitor
but
as
this
meant
a
deathblow
to
the
business
she
took
a
man
resolution
she
wrote
to
metivier
with
whom
david
and
the
cointets
and
almost
every
papermaker
in
the
department
had
business
relations
and
asked
him
to
put
the
following
advertisement
into
a
trade
paper
for
sale
as
a
going
concern
a
printing
office
with
license
and
plant
situated
at
angouleme
apply
for
particulars
to
metivier
rue
serpente
the
cointets
saw
the
advertisement
that
little
woman
has
a
head
on
her
shoulders
they
said
it
is
time
that
we
took
her
business
under
our
own
control
by
giving
her
enough
work
to
live
upon
we
might
find
a
real
competitor
in
david
successor
it
is
in
our
interest
to
keep
an
eye
upon
that
workshop
the
cointets
went
to
speak
to
david
sechard
moved
thereto
by
this
thought
eve
saw
them
knew
that
her
stratagem
had
succeeded
at
once
and
felt
a
thrill
of
the
keenest
joy
they
stated
their
proposal
they
had
more
work
than
they
could
undertake
their
presses
could
not
keep
pace
with
the
work
would
sechard
print
for
them
they
had
sent
to
bordeaux
for
workmen
and
could
find
enough
to
give
full
employment
to
david
three
presses
gentlemen
said
eve
while
cerizet
went
across
to
david
workshop
to
announce
the
two
printers
while
my
husband
was
with
the
mm
didot
he
came
to
know
of
excellent
workers
honest
and
industrious
men
he
will
choose
his
successor
no
doubt
from
among
the
best
of
them
if
he
sold
his
business
outright
for
some
twenty
thousand
francs
it
might
bring
us
in
a
thousand
francs
per
annum
that
would
be
better
than
losing
a
thousand
yearly
over
such
trade
as
you
leave
us
why
did
you
envy
us
the
poor
little
almanac
speculation
especially
as
we
have
always
brought
it
out
oh
why
did
you
not
give
us
notice
madame
we
would
not
have
interfered
with
you
one
of
the
brothers
answered
blandly
he
was
known
as
the
tall
cointet
oh
come
gentlemen
you
only
began
your
almanac
after
cerizet
told
you
that
i
was
bringing
out
mine
she
spoke
briskly
looking
full
at
the
tall
cointet
as
she
spoke
he
lowered
his
eyes
cerizet
treachery
was
proven
to
her
this
brother
managed
the
business
and
the
he
was
by
far
the
cleverer
man
of
business
of
the
two
jean
showed
no
small
ability
in
the
conduct
of
the
printing
establishment
but
in
intellectual
capacity
he
might
be
said
to
take
colonel
rank
while
boniface
was
a
general
jean
left
the
command
to
boniface
this
latter
was
thin
and
spare
in
person
his
face
sallow
as
an
altar
candle
was
mottled
with
reddish
patches
his
lips
were
pinched
there
was
something
in
his
eyes
that
reminded
you
of
a
cat
eyes
boniface
cointet
never
excited
himself
he
would
listen
to
the
grossest
insults
with
the
serenity
of
a
bigot
and
reply
in
a
smooth
voice
he
went
to
mass
he
went
to
confession
he
took
the
sacrament
beneath
his
caressing
manners
beneath
an
almost
spiritless
look
lurked
the
tenacity
and
ambition
of
the
priest
and
the
greed
of
the
man
of
business
consumed
with
a
thirst
for
riches
and
honors
in
the
year
tall
cointet
wanted
all
that
the
finally
obtained
by
the
revolution
of
in
his
heart
he
hated
the
aristocrats
and
in
religion
he
was
indifferent
he
was
as
much
or
as
little
of
a
bigot
as
bonaparte
was
a
member
of
the
mountain
yet
his
vertebral
column
bent
with
a
flexibility
wonderful
to
behold
before
the
noblesse
and
the
official
hierarchy
for
the
powers
that
be
he
humbled
himself
he
was
meek
and
obsequious
one
final
characteristic
will
describe
him
for
those
who
are
accustomed
to
dealings
with
all
kinds
of
men
and
can
appreciate
its
value
cointet
concealed
the
expression
of
his
eyes
by
wearing
colored
glasses
ostensibly
to
preserve
his
sight
from
the
reflection
of
the
sunlight
on
the
white
buildings
in
the
streets
for
angouleme
being
set
upon
a
hill
is
exposed
to
the
full
glare
of
the
sun
tall
cointet
was
really
scarcely
above
middle
height
he
looked
much
taller
than
he
actually
was
by
reason
of
the
thinness
which
told
of
overwork
and
a
brain
in
continual
ferment
his
lank
sleek
gray
hair
cut
in
somewhat
ecclesiastical
fashion
the
black
trousers
black
stockings
black
waistcoat
and
long
greatcoat
styled
a
in
the
south
all
completed
his
resemblance
to
a
jesuit
boniface
was
called
tall
cointet
to
distinguish
him
from
his
brother
fat
cointet
and
the
nicknames
expressed
a
difference
in
character
as
well
as
a
physical
difference
between
a
pair
of
equally
redoubtable
personages
as
for
jean
cointet
a
jolly
stout
fellow
with
a
face
from
a
flemish
interior
colored
by
the
southern
sun
of
angouleme
short
and
paunchy
as
sancho
panza
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
and
a
pair
of
sturdy
shoulders
he
was
a
striking
contrast
to
his
older
brother
nor
was
the
difference
only
physical
and
intellectual
jean
might
almost
be
called
liberal
in
politics
he
belonged
to
the
left
centre
only
went
to
mass
on
sundays
and
lived
on
a
remarkably
good
understanding
with
the
liberal
men
of
business
there
were
those
in
who
said
that
this
divergence
between
the
brothers
was
more
apparent
than
real
tall
cointet
turned
his
brother
seeming
good
nature
to
advantage
very
skilfully
jean
was
his
bludgeon
it
was
jean
who
gave
all
the
hard
words
it
was
jean
who
conducted
the
executions
which
little
beseemed
the
elder
benevolence
jean
took
the
storms
department
he
would
fly
into
a
rage
and
propose
terms
that
nobody
would
think
of
accepting
to
pave
the
way
for
his
brother
less
unreasonable
propositions
and
by
such
policy
the
pair
attained
their
ends
sooner
or
later
eve
with
a
woman
tact
had
soon
divined
the
characters
of
the
two
brothers
she
was
on
her
guard
with
foes
so
formidable
david
informed
beforehand
of
everything
by
his
wife
lent
a
profoundly
inattentive
mind
to
his
enemies
proposals
come
to
an
understanding
with
my
wife
he
said
as
he
left
the
cointets
in
the
office
and
went
back
to
his
laboratory
mme
sechard
knows
more
about
the
business
than
i
do
myself
i
am
interested
in
something
that
will
pay
better
than
this
poor
place
i
hope
to
find
a
way
to
retrieve
the
losses
that
i
have
made
through
you
and
how
asked
the
fat
cointet
chuckling
eve
gave
her
husband
a
look
that
meant
be
careful
you
will
be
my
tributaries
said
david
and
all
other
consumers
of
papers
besides
then
what
are
you
investigating
asked
the
hypocritical
boniface
cointet
boniface
question
slipped
out
smoothly
and
insinuatingly
and
again
eve
eyes
implored
her
husband
to
give
an
answer
that
was
no
answer
or
to
say
nothing
at
all
i
am
trying
to
produce
paper
at
fifty
per
cent
less
than
the
present
cost
price
and
he
went
he
did
not
see
the
glances
exchanged
between
the
brothers
that
is
an
inventor
a
man
of
his
build
can
not
sit
with
his
hands
before
let
us
exploit
him
said
boniface
eyes
how
can
we
do
it
said
jean
mme
sechard
spoke
david
treats
me
just
in
the
same
way
she
said
if
i
show
any
curiosity
he
feels
suspicious
of
my
name
no
doubt
and
out
comes
that
remark
of
his
it
is
only
a
formula
after
all
if
your
husband
can
work
out
the
formula
he
will
certainly
make
a
fortune
more
quickly
than
by
printing
i
am
not
surprised
that
he
leaves
the
business
to
itself
said
boniface
looking
across
the
empty
workshop
where
kolb
seated
upon
a
was
rubbing
his
bread
with
a
clove
of
garlic
but
it
would
not
suit
our
views
to
see
this
place
in
the
hands
of
an
energetic
pushing
ambitious
competitor
he
continued
and
perhaps
it
might
be
possible
to
arrive
at
an
understanding
suppose
for
instance
that
you
consented
for
a
consideration
to
allow
us
to
put
in
one
of
our
own
men
to
work
your
presses
for
our
benefit
but
nominally
for
you
the
thing
is
sometimes
done
in
paris
we
would
find
the
fellow
work
enough
to
enable
him
to
rent
your
place
and
pay
you
well
and
yet
make
a
profit
for
himself
it
depends
on
the
amount
said
eve
sechard
what
is
your
offer
she
added
looking
at
boniface
to
let
him
see
that
she
understood
his
scheme
perfectly
well
what
is
your
own
idea
jean
cointet
put
in
briskly
three
thousand
francs
for
six
months
said
she
why
my
dear
young
lady
you
were
proposing
to
sell
the
place
outright
for
twenty
thousand
francs
said
boniface
with
much
suavity
the
interest
on
twenty
thousand
francs
is
only
twelve
hundred
francs
per
annum
at
six
per
cent
for
a
moment
eve
was
thrown
into
confusion
she
saw
the
need
for
discretion
in
matters
of
business
you
wish
to
use
our
presses
and
our
name
as
well
she
said
and
as
i
have
already
shown
you
i
can
still
do
a
little
business
and
then
we
pay
rent
to
sechard
senior
who
does
not
load
us
with
presents
after
two
hours
of
debate
eve
obtained
two
thousand
francs
for
six
months
one
thousand
to
be
paid
in
advance
when
everything
was
concluded
the
brothers
informed
her
that
they
meant
to
put
in
cerizet
as
lessee
of
the
premises
in
spite
of
herself
eve
started
with
surprise
is
it
better
to
have
somebody
who
knows
the
workshop
asked
the
fat
cointet
eve
made
no
reply
she
took
leave
of
the
brothers
vowing
inwardly
to
look
after
cerizet
well
here
are
our
enemies
in
the
place
laughed
david
when
eve
brought
out
the
papers
for
his
signature
at
pshaw
said
she
i
will
answer
for
kolb
and
marion
they
alone
would
look
after
things
besides
we
shall
be
making
an
income
of
four
thousand
francs
from
the
workshop
which
only
costs
us
money
as
it
is
and
looking
forward
i
see
a
year
in
which
you
may
realize
your
hopes
you
were
born
to
be
the
wife
of
a
scientific
worker
as
you
said
by
the
weir
said
david
grasping
her
hand
tenderly
but
though
the
sechard
household
had
money
sufficient
that
winter
they
were
none
the
less
subjected
to
cerizet
espionage
and
all
unconsciously
became
dependent
upon
boniface
cointet
we
have
them
now
the
manager
of
the
had
exclaimed
as
he
left
the
house
with
his
brother
the
printer
they
will
begin
to
regard
the
rent
as
regular
income
they
will
count
upon
it
and
run
themselves
into
debt
in
six
months
time
we
will
decline
to
renew
the
agreement
and
then
we
shall
see
what
this
man
of
genius
has
at
the
bottom
of
his
mind
we
will
offer
to
help
him
out
of
his
difficulty
by
taking
him
into
partnership
and
exploiting
his
discovery
any
shrewd
man
of
business
who
should
have
seen
tall
cointet
face
as
he
uttered
those
words
taking
him
into
partnership
would
have
known
that
it
behooves
a
man
to
be
even
more
careful
in
the
selection
of
the
partner
whom
he
takes
before
the
tribunal
of
commerce
than
in
the
choice
of
the
wife
whom
he
weds
at
the
mayor
office
was
it
not
enough
already
and
more
than
enough
that
the
ruthless
hunters
were
on
the
track
of
the
quarry
how
should
david
and
his
wife
with
kolb
and
marion
to
help
them
escape
the
toils
of
a
boniface
cointet
a
draft
for
five
hundred
francs
came
from
lucien
and
this
with
cerizet
second
payment
enabled
them
to
meet
all
the
expenses
of
mme
sechard
confinement
eve
and
the
mother
and
david
had
thought
that
lucien
had
forgotten
them
and
rejoiced
over
this
token
of
remembrance
as
they
rejoiced
over
his
success
for
his
first
exploits
in
journalism
made
even
more
noise
in
angouleme
than
in
paris
but
david
thus
lulled
into
a
false
security
was
to
receive
a
staggering
blow
a
cruel
letter
from
lucien
to
my
dear
david
i
have
drawn
three
bills
on
you
and
negotiated
them
with
metivier
they
fall
due
in
one
two
and
three
time
i
took
this
hateful
course
which
i
know
will
burden
you
heavily
because
the
one
alternative
was
suicide
i
will
explain
my
necessity
some
time
and
i
will
try
besides
to
send
the
amounts
as
the
bills
fall
due
burn
this
letter
say
nothing
to
my
mother
and
sister
for
i
confess
it
i
have
counted
upon
you
upon
the
heroism
known
so
well
to
your
despairing
brother
lucien
de
rubempre
by
this
time
eve
had
recovered
from
her
confinement
your
brother
poor
fellow
is
in
desperate
straits
david
told
her
i
have
sent
him
three
bills
for
a
thousand
francs
at
one
two
and
three
months
just
make
a
note
of
them
and
he
went
out
into
the
fields
to
escape
his
wife
questionings
but
eve
had
felt
very
uneasy
already
it
was
six
months
since
lucien
had
written
to
them
she
talked
over
the
news
with
her
mother
till
her
forebodings
grew
so
dark
that
she
made
up
her
mind
to
dissipate
them
she
would
take
a
bold
step
in
her
despair
young
de
rastignac
had
come
to
spend
a
few
days
with
his
family
he
had
spoken
of
lucien
in
terms
that
set
paris
gossip
circulating
in
angouleme
till
at
last
it
reached
the
journalist
mother
and
sister
eve
went
to
mme
de
rastignac
asked
the
favor
of
an
interview
with
her
son
spoke
of
all
her
fears
and
asked
him
for
the
truth
in
a
moment
eve
heard
of
her
brother
connection
with
the
actress
coralie
of
his
duel
with
michel
chrestien
arising
out
of
his
own
treacherous
behavior
to
daniel
she
received
in
short
a
version
of
lucien
history
colored
by
the
personal
feeling
of
a
clever
and
envious
dandy
rastignac
expressed
sincere
admiration
for
the
abilities
so
terribly
compromised
and
a
patriotic
fear
for
the
future
of
a
native
genius
spite
and
jealousy
masqueraded
as
pity
and
friendliness
he
spoke
of
lucien
blunders
it
seemed
that
lucien
had
forfeited
the
favor
of
a
very
great
person
and
that
a
patent
conferring
the
right
to
bear
the
name
and
arms
of
rubempre
had
actually
been
made
out
and
subsequently
torn
up
if
your
brother
madame
had
been
well
advised
he
would
have
been
on
the
way
to
honors
and
mme
de
bargeton
husband
by
this
time
but
what
can
you
expect
he
deserted
her
and
insulted
her
she
is
now
mme
la
comtesse
sixte
du
chatelet
to
her
own
great
regret
for
she
loved
lucien
is
it
possible
exclaimed
mme
sechard
your
brother
is
like
a
young
eagle
blinded
by
the
first
rays
of
glory
and
luxury
when
an
eagle
falls
who
can
tell
how
far
he
may
sink
before
he
drops
to
the
bottom
of
some
precipice
the
fall
of
a
great
man
is
always
proportionately
great
eve
came
away
with
a
great
dread
in
her
heart
those
last
words
pierced
her
like
an
arrow
she
had
been
wounded
to
the
quick
she
said
not
a
word
to
anybody
but
again
and
again
a
tear
rolled
down
her
cheeks
and
fell
upon
the
child
at
her
breast
so
hard
is
it
to
give
up
illusions
sanctioned
by
family
feeling
illusions
that
have
grown
with
our
growth
that
eve
had
doubted
eugene
de
rastignac
she
would
rather
hear
a
true
friend
account
of
her
brother
lucien
had
given
them
address
in
the
days
when
he
was
full
of
enthusiasm
for
the
brotherhood
she
wrote
a
pathetic
letter
to
and
received
the
following
reply
to
mme
madame
you
ask
me
to
tell
you
the
truth
about
the
life
that
your
brother
is
leading
in
paris
you
are
anxious
for
enlightenment
as
to
his
prospects
and
to
encourage
a
frank
answer
on
my
part
you
repeat
certain
things
that
de
rastignac
has
told
you
asking
me
if
they
are
true
with
regard
to
the
purely
personal
matter
madame
de
rastignac
confidences
must
be
corrected
in
lucien
favor
your
brother
wrote
a
criticism
of
my
book
and
brought
it
to
me
in
remorse
telling
me
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
publish
it
although
obedience
to
the
orders
of
his
party
might
endanger
one
who
was
very
dear
to
him
alas
madame
a
man
of
letters
must
needs
comprehend
all
passions
since
it
is
his
pride
to
express
them
i
understood
that
where
a
mistress
and
a
friend
are
involved
the
friend
is
inevitably
sacrificed
i
smoothed
your
brother
way
i
corrected
his
murderous
article
myself
and
gave
it
my
full
approval
you
ask
whether
lucien
has
kept
my
friendship
and
esteem
to
this
it
is
difficult
to
make
an
answer
your
brother
is
on
a
road
that
leads
him
to
ruin
at
this
moment
i
still
feel
sorry
for
him
before
long
i
shall
have
forgotten
him
of
set
purpose
not
so
much
on
account
of
what
he
has
done
already
as
for
that
which
he
inevitably
will
do
your
lucien
is
not
a
poet
he
has
the
poetic
temper
he
dreams
he
does
not
think
he
spends
himself
in
emotion
he
does
not
create
he
is
in
fact
permit
me
to
say
it
a
womanish
creature
that
loves
to
shine
the
frenchman
great
failing
lucien
will
always
sacrifice
his
best
friend
for
the
pleasure
of
displaying
his
own
wit
he
would
not
hesitate
to
sign
a
pact
with
the
devil
if
so
he
might
secure
a
few
years
of
luxurious
and
glorious
life
nay
has
he
not
done
worse
already
he
has
bartered
his
future
for
the
delights
of
living
openly
with
an
actress
so
far
he
has
not
seen
the
dangers
of
his
position
the
girl
youth
and
beauty
and
devotion
for
she
worships
him
have
closed
his
eyes
to
the
truth
he
can
not
see
that
no
glory
or
success
or
fortune
can
induce
the
world
to
accept
the
position
very
well
as
it
is
now
so
it
will
be
with
each
new
temptation
your
brother
will
not
look
beyond
the
enjoyment
of
the
moment
do
not
be
alarmed
lucien
will
never
go
so
far
as
a
crime
he
has
not
the
strength
of
character
but
he
would
take
the
fruits
of
a
crime
he
would
share
the
benefit
but
not
the
risk
a
thing
that
seems
abhorrent
to
the
whole
world
even
to
scoundrels
oh
he
would
despise
himself
he
would
repent
but
bring
him
once
more
to
the
test
and
he
would
fail
again
for
he
is
weak
of
will
he
can
not
resist
the
allurements
of
pleasure
nor
forego
the
least
of
his
ambitions
he
is
indolent
like
all
who
would
fain
be
poets
he
thinks
it
clever
to
juggle
with
the
difficulties
of
life
instead
of
facing
and
overcoming
them
he
will
be
brave
at
one
time
cowardly
at
another
and
deserves
neither
credit
for
his
courage
nor
blame
for
his
cowardice
lucien
is
like
a
harp
with
strings
that
are
slackened
or
tightened
by
the
atmosphere
he
might
write
a
great
book
in
a
glad
or
angry
mood
and
care
nothing
for
the
success
that
he
had
desired
for
so
long
when
he
first
came
to
paris
he
fell
under
the
influence
of
an
unprincipled
young
fellow
and
was
dazzled
by
his
adroitness
and
experience
in
the
difficulties
of
a
literary
life
this
juggler
completely
bewitched
lucien
he
dragged
him
into
a
life
which
a
man
can
not
lead
and
respect
himself
and
unluckily
for
lucien
love
shed
its
magic
over
the
path
the
admiration
that
is
given
too
readily
is
a
sign
of
want
of
judgment
a
poet
ought
not
to
be
paid
in
the
same
coin
as
a
dancer
on
the
we
all
felt
hurt
when
intrigue
and
literary
rascality
were
preferred
to
the
courage
and
honor
of
those
who
counseled
lucien
rather
to
face
the
battle
than
to
filch
success
to
spring
down
into
the
arena
rather
than
become
a
trumpet
in
the
orchestra
society
madame
oddly
enough
shows
plentiful
indulgence
to
young
men
of
lucien
stamp
they
are
popular
the
world
is
fascinated
by
their
external
gifts
and
good
looks
nothing
is
asked
of
them
all
their
sins
are
forgiven
they
are
treated
like
perfect
natures
others
are
blind
to
their
defects
they
are
the
world
spoiled
children
and
on
the
other
hand
the
world
is
stern
beyond
measure
to
strong
and
complete
natures
perhaps
in
this
apparently
flagrant
injustice
society
acts
sublimely
taking
a
harlequin
at
his
just
worth
asking
nothing
of
him
but
amusement
promptly
forgetting
him
and
asking
divine
great
deeds
of
those
before
whom
she
bends
the
knee
everything
is
judged
by
laws
of
its
being
the
diamond
must
be
flawless
the
ephemeral
creation
of
fashion
may
be
flimsy
bizarre
inconsequent
so
lucien
may
perhaps
succeed
to
admiration
in
spite
of
his
mistakes
he
has
only
to
profit
by
some
happy
vein
or
to
be
among
good
companions
but
if
an
evil
angel
crosses
his
path
he
will
go
to
the
very
depths
of
hell
is
a
brilliant
assemblage
of
good
qualities
embroidered
upon
too
slight
a
tissue
time
wears
the
flowers
away
till
nothing
but
the
web
is
left
and
if
that
is
poor
stuff
you
behold
a
rag
at
the
last
so
long
as
lucien
is
young
people
will
like
him
but
where
will
he
be
as
a
man
of
thirty
that
is
the
question
which
those
who
love
him
sincerely
are
bound
to
ask
themselves
if
i
alone
had
come
to
think
in
this
way
of
lucien
i
might
perhaps
have
spared
you
the
pain
which
my
plain
speaking
will
give
you
but
to
evade
the
questions
put
by
your
anxiety
and
to
answer
a
cry
of
anguish
like
your
letter
with
commonplaces
seemed
to
me
alike
unworthy
of
you
and
of
me
whom
you
esteem
too
highly
and
besides
those
of
my
friends
who
knew
lucien
are
unanimous
in
their
judgment
so
it
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
duty
to
put
the
truth
before
you
terrible
though
it
may
be
anything
may
be
expected
of
lucien
anything
good
or
evil
that
is
our
opinion
and
this
letter
is
summed
up
in
that
sentence
if
the
vicissitudes
of
his
present
way
of
life
a
very
wretched
and
slippery
one
should
bring
the
poet
back
to
you
use
all
your
influence
to
keep
him
among
you
for
until
his
character
has
acquired
stability
paris
will
not
be
safe
for
him
he
used
to
speak
of
you
you
and
your
husband
as
his
guardian
angels
he
has
forgotten
you
no
doubt
but
he
will
remember
you
again
when
tossed
by
tempest
with
no
refuge
left
to
him
but
his
home
keep
your
heart
for
him
madame
he
will
need
it
permit
me
madame
to
convey
to
you
the
expression
of
the
sincere
respect
of
a
man
to
whom
your
rare
qualities
are
known
a
man
who
honors
your
mother
fears
so
much
that
he
desires
to
style
himself
your
devoted
servant
two
days
after
the
letter
came
eve
was
obliged
to
find
a
her
milk
had
dried
up
she
had
made
a
god
of
her
brother
now
in
her
eyes
he
was
depraved
through
the
exercise
of
his
noblest
faculties
he
was
wallowing
in
the
mire
she
noble
creature
that
she
was
was
incapable
of
swerving
from
honesty
and
scrupulous
delicacy
from
all
the
pious
traditions
of
the
hearth
which
still
burns
so
clearly
and
sheds
its
light
abroad
in
quiet
country
homes
then
david
had
been
right
in
his
forecasts
the
leaden
hues
of
grief
overspread
white
brow
she
told
her
husband
her
secret
in
one
of
the
pellucid
talks
in
which
married
lovers
tell
everything
to
each
other
the
tones
of
david
voice
brought
comfort
though
the
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
when
he
knew
that
grief
had
dried
his
wife
fair
breast
and
knew
eve
despair
that
she
could
not
fulfil
a
mother
duties
he
held
out
reassuring
hopes
your
brother
imagination
has
let
him
astray
you
see
child
it
is
so
natural
that
a
poet
should
wish
for
blue
and
purple
robes
and
hurry
as
eagerly
after
festivals
as
he
does
it
is
a
bird
that
loves
glitter
and
luxury
with
such
simple
sincerity
that
god
forgives
him
if
man
condemns
him
for
it
but
he
is
draining
our
lives
exclaimed
poor
eve
he
is
draining
our
lives
just
now
but
only
a
few
months
ago
he
saved
us
by
sending
us
the
first
fruits
of
his
earnings
said
the
good
david
he
had
the
sense
to
see
that
his
wife
was
in
despair
was
going
beyond
the
limit
and
that
love
for
lucien
would
very
soon
come
back
fifty
years
ago
or
thereabouts
mercier
said
in
his
de
that
a
man
can
not
live
by
literature
poetry
letters
or
science
by
the
creatures
of
his
brain
in
short
and
lucien
poet
that
he
is
would
not
believe
the
experience
of
five
centuries
the
harvests
that
are
watered
with
ink
are
only
reaped
ten
or
twelve
years
after
the
sowing
if
indeed
there
is
any
harvest
after
all
lucien
has
taken
the
green
wheat
for
the
sheaves
he
will
have
learned
something
of
life
at
any
rate
he
was
the
dupe
of
a
woman
at
the
outset
he
was
sure
to
be
duped
afterwards
by
the
world
and
false
friends
he
has
bought
his
experience
dear
that
is
all
our
ancestors
used
to
say
the
son
of
the
house
brings
back
his
two
ears
and
his
honor
safe
all
is
well
honor
poor
eve
broke
in
oh
but
lucien
has
fallen
in
so
many
ways
writing
against
his
conscience
attacking
his
best
friend
living
upon
an
actress
showing
himself
in
public
with
her
bringing
us
to
lie
on
straw
oh
that
is
nothing
cried
david
and
suddenly
stopped
short
the
secret
of
lucien
forgery
had
nearly
escaped
him
and
unluckily
his
start
left
a
vague
uneasy
impression
on
eve
what
do
you
mean
by
nothing
she
answered
and
where
shall
we
find
the
money
to
meet
bills
for
three
thousand
francs
we
shall
be
obliged
to
renew
the
lease
with
cerizet
to
begin
with
said
david
the
cointets
have
been
allowing
him
fifteen
per
cent
on
the
work
done
for
them
and
in
that
way
alone
he
has
made
six
hundred
francs
besides
contriving
to
make
five
hundred
francs
by
job
printing
if
the
cointets
know
that
perhaps
they
will
not
renew
the
lease
they
will
be
afraid
of
him
for
cerizet
is
a
dangerous
man
eh
what
is
that
to
me
cried
david
we
shall
be
rich
in
a
very
little
while
when
lucien
is
rich
dear
angel
he
will
have
nothing
but
good
qualities
oh
david
my
dear
my
dear
what
is
this
that
you
have
said
unthinkingly
then
lucien
fallen
into
the
clutches
of
poverty
would
not
have
the
force
of
character
to
resist
evil
and
you
think
just
as
thinks
no
one
is
great
unless
he
has
strength
of
character
and
lucien
is
weak
an
angel
must
not
be
tempted
what
is
that
what
but
a
nature
that
is
noble
only
in
its
own
region
its
own
sphere
its
heaven
i
will
spare
him
the
struggle
lucien
is
not
meant
for
it
look
here
i
am
so
near
the
end
now
that
i
can
talk
to
you
about
the
means
he
drew
several
sheets
of
white
paper
from
his
pocket
brandished
them
in
triumph
and
laid
them
on
his
wife
lap
a
ream
of
this
paper
royal
size
would
cost
five
francs
at
the
most
he
added
while
eve
handled
the
specimens
with
almost
childish
surprise
why
how
did
you
make
these
sample
bits
she
asked
with
an
old
kitchen
sieve
of
marion
and
are
you
not
satisfied
yet
asked
eve
the
problem
does
not
lie
in
the
manufacturing
process
it
is
a
question
of
the
first
cost
of
the
pulp
alas
child
i
am
only
a
late
comer
in
a
difficult
path
as
long
ago
as
mme
masson
tried
to
use
printed
paper
a
second
time
she
succeeded
but
what
a
price
it
cost
the
marquis
of
salisbury
tried
to
use
straw
as
a
material
in
and
the
same
idea
occurred
to
seguin
in
france
in
those
sheets
in
your
hand
are
made
from
the
common
rush
the
but
i
shall
try
nettles
and
thistles
for
if
the
material
is
to
continue
to
be
cheap
one
must
look
for
something
that
will
grow
in
marshes
and
waste
lands
where
nothing
else
can
be
grown
the
whole
secret
lies
in
the
preparation
of
the
stems
at
present
my
method
is
not
quite
simple
enough
still
in
spite
of
this
difficulty
i
feel
sure
that
i
can
give
the
french
paper
trade
the
privilege
of
our
literature
papermaking
will
be
for
france
what
coal
and
iron
and
coarse
potter
clay
are
for
england
a
monopoly
i
mean
to
be
the
jacquart
of
the
trade
eve
rose
to
her
feet
david
had
roused
her
to
enthusiasm
to
admiration
she
held
out
her
arms
to
him
and
held
him
tightly
to
her
while
she
laid
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
you
give
me
my
reward
as
if
i
had
succeeded
already
he
said
for
all
answer
eve
held
up
her
sweet
face
wet
with
tears
to
his
and
for
a
moment
she
could
not
speak
the
kiss
was
not
for
the
man
of
genius
she
said
but
for
my
comforter
here
is
a
rising
glory
for
the
glory
that
has
set
and
in
the
midst
of
my
grief
for
the
brother
that
has
fallen
so
low
my
husband
greatness
is
revealed
to
yes
you
will
be
great
great
like
the
graindorges
the
rouvets
and
van
robais
and
the
persian
who
discovered
madder
like
all
the
men
you
have
told
me
about
great
men
whom
nobody
remembers
because
their
good
deeds
were
obscure
industrial
triumphs
what
are
they
doing
just
now
it
was
boniface
cointet
who
spoke
he
was
walking
up
and
down
outside
in
the
place
du
murier
with
cerizet
watching
the
silhouettes
of
the
husband
and
wife
on
the
blinds
he
always
came
at
midnight
for
a
chat
with
cerizet
for
the
latter
played
the
spy
upon
his
former
every
movement
he
is
showing
her
the
paper
he
made
this
morning
no
doubt
said
cerizet
what
is
it
made
of
asked
the
paper
manufacturer
impossible
to
guess
answered
cerizet
i
made
a
hole
in
the
roof
and
scrambled
up
and
watched
the
gaffer
he
was
boiling
pulp
in
a
copper
pan
all
last
night
there
was
a
heap
of
stuff
in
a
corner
but
i
could
make
nothing
of
it
it
looked
like
a
heap
of
tow
as
near
as
i
could
make
out
go
no
farther
said
boniface
cointet
in
unctuous
tones
it
would
not
be
right
mme
sechard
will
offer
to
renew
your
lease
tell
her
that
you
are
thinking
of
setting
up
for
yourself
offer
her
half
the
value
of
the
plant
and
license
and
if
she
takes
the
bid
come
to
me
in
any
case
spin
the
matter
out
have
they
no
money
not
a
sou
said
cerizet
not
a
sou
repeated
tall
i
have
them
now
said
he
to
himself
metivier
paper
manufacturers
wholesale
agent
and
cointet
brothers
printers
and
paper
manufacturers
were
also
bankers
in
all
but
name
this
surreptitious
banking
system
defies
all
the
ingenuity
of
the
inland
revenue
department
every
banker
is
required
to
take
out
a
license
which
in
paris
costs
five
hundred
francs
but
no
hitherto
devised
method
of
controlling
commerce
can
detect
the
delinquents
or
compel
them
to
pay
their
due
to
the
government
and
though
metivier
and
the
cointets
were
outside
brokers
in
the
language
of
the
stock
exchange
none
the
less
among
them
they
could
set
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
francs
moving
every
three
months
in
the
markets
of
paris
bordeaux
and
angouleme
now
it
so
fell
out
that
that
very
evening
cointet
brothers
had
received
lucien
forged
bills
in
the
course
of
business
upon
this
debt
tall
cointet
forthwith
erected
a
formidable
engine
pointed
as
will
presently
be
seen
against
the
poor
patient
inventor
by
seven
next
morning
boniface
cointet
was
taking
a
walk
by
the
mill
stream
that
turned
the
wheels
in
his
big
factory
the
sound
of
the
water
covered
his
talk
for
he
was
talking
with
a
companion
a
young
man
of
who
had
been
appointed
attorney
to
the
court
of
first
instance
in
angouleme
some
six
weeks
ago
the
young
man
name
was
pierre
you
are
a
schoolfellow
of
david
sechard
are
you
not
asked
tall
cointet
by
way
of
greeting
to
the
young
attorney
had
lost
no
time
in
answering
the
wealthy
manufacturer
summons
yes
sir
said
keeping
step
with
tall
cointet
have
you
renewed
the
acquaintance
we
have
met
once
or
twice
at
most
since
he
came
back
it
could
hardly
have
been
otherwise
in
paris
i
was
buried
away
in
the
office
or
at
the
courts
on
and
on
sundays
and
holidays
i
was
hard
at
work
studying
for
i
had
only
myself
to
look
to
tall
cointet
nodded
approvingly
when
we
met
again
david
and
i
he
asked
me
what
i
had
done
with
myself
i
told
him
that
after
i
had
finished
my
time
at
poitiers
i
had
risen
to
be
maitre
olivet
and
that
some
time
or
other
i
hoped
to
make
a
bid
for
his
berth
i
know
a
good
deal
more
of
lucien
chardon
de
rubempre
he
calls
himself
now
he
was
mme
de
bargeton
lover
our
great
poet
david
sechard
in
fact
then
you
can
go
and
tell
david
of
your
appointment
and
offer
him
your
services
said
tall
cointet
one
ca
do
that
said
the
young
attorney
he
has
never
had
a
lawsuit
and
he
has
no
attorney
so
one
can
do
that
said
cointet
scanning
the
other
narrowly
from
behind
his
colored
spectacles
a
certain
quantity
of
gall
mingled
with
the
blood
in
pierre
veins
his
father
was
a
tailor
in
and
his
schoolfellows
had
looked
down
upon
him
his
complexion
was
of
the
muddy
and
unwholesome
kind
which
tells
a
tale
of
bad
health
late
hours
and
penury
and
almost
always
of
a
bad
disposition
the
best
description
of
him
may
be
given
in
two
familiar
expressions
he
was
sharp
and
snappish
his
cracked
voice
suited
his
sour
face
meagre
look
and
magpie
eyes
of
no
particular
color
a
magpie
eye
according
to
napoleon
is
a
sure
sign
of
dishonesty
look
at
he
said
to
las
cases
at
saint
helena
alluding
to
a
confidential
servant
whom
he
had
been
obliged
to
dismiss
for
malversation
i
do
not
know
how
i
could
have
been
deceived
in
him
for
so
long
he
has
a
magpie
eye
tall
cointet
surveying
the
weedy
little
lawyer
noted
his
face
pitted
with
smallpox
the
thin
hair
and
the
forehead
bald
already
receding
towards
a
bald
cranium
saw
too
the
confession
of
weakness
in
his
attitude
with
the
hand
on
the
hip
here
is
my
man
said
he
to
himself
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
who
had
drunk
scorn
like
water
was
eaten
up
with
a
strong
desire
to
succeed
in
life
he
had
no
money
but
nevertheless
he
had
the
audacity
to
buy
his
employer
connection
for
thirty
thousand
francs
reckoning
upon
a
rich
marriage
to
clear
off
the
debt
and
looking
to
his
employer
after
the
usual
custom
to
find
him
a
wife
for
an
attorney
always
has
an
interest
in
marrying
his
successor
because
he
is
the
sooner
paid
off
but
if
counted
upon
his
employer
he
counted
yet
more
upon
himself
he
had
more
than
average
ability
and
that
of
a
kind
not
often
found
in
the
provinces
and
rancor
was
the
mainspring
of
his
power
a
mighty
hatred
makes
a
mighty
effort
there
is
a
great
difference
between
a
country
attorney
and
an
attorney
in
paris
tall
cointet
was
too
clever
not
to
know
this
and
to
turn
the
meaner
passions
that
move
a
pettifogging
lawyer
to
good
account
an
eminent
attorney
in
paris
and
there
are
many
who
may
be
so
qualified
is
bound
to
possess
to
some
extent
the
qualities
he
had
so
much
business
to
transact
business
in
which
large
interests
are
involved
questions
of
such
wide
interest
are
submitted
to
him
that
he
does
not
look
upon
procedure
as
machinery
for
bringing
money
into
his
pocket
but
as
a
weapon
of
attack
and
defence
a
country
attorney
on
the
other
hand
cultivates
the
science
of
costs
as
it
is
called
in
paris
a
host
of
small
items
that
swell
lawyers
bills
and
require
stamped
paper
these
weighty
matters
of
the
law
completely
fill
the
country
attorney
mind
he
has
a
bill
of
costs
always
before
his
eyes
whereas
his
brother
of
paris
thinks
of
nothing
but
his
fees
the
fee
is
a
honorarium
paid
by
a
client
over
and
above
the
bill
of
costs
for
the
more
or
less
skilful
conduct
of
his
case
of
the
bill
of
costs
goes
to
the
treasury
whereas
the
entire
fee
belongs
to
the
attorney
let
us
admit
frankly
that
the
fees
received
are
seldom
as
large
as
the
fees
demanded
and
deserved
by
a
clever
lawyer
wherefore
in
paris
attorneys
doctors
and
barristers
like
courtesans
with
a
lover
take
very
considerable
precautions
against
the
gratitude
of
clients
the
client
before
and
after
the
lawsuit
would
furnish
a
subject
worthy
of
meissonier
there
would
be
brisk
bidding
among
attorneys
for
the
possession
of
two
such
admirable
bits
of
genre
there
is
yet
another
difference
between
the
parisian
and
the
country
attorney
an
attorney
in
paris
very
seldom
appears
in
court
though
he
is
sometimes
called
upon
to
act
as
arbitrator
barristers
at
the
present
day
swarm
in
the
provinces
but
in
the
country
attorney
very
often
united
the
functions
of
solicitor
and
counsel
as
a
result
of
this
double
life
the
attorney
acquired
the
peculiar
intellectual
defects
of
the
barrister
and
retained
the
heavy
responsibilities
of
the
attorney
he
grew
talkative
and
fluent
and
lost
his
lucidity
of
judgment
the
first
necessity
for
the
conduct
of
affairs
if
a
man
of
more
than
ordinary
ability
tries
to
do
the
work
of
two
men
he
is
apt
to
find
that
the
two
men
are
mediocrities
the
paris
attorney
never
spends
himself
in
forensic
eloquence
and
as
he
seldom
attempts
to
argue
for
and
against
he
has
some
hope
of
preserving
his
mental
rectitude
it
is
true
that
he
brings
the
balista
of
the
law
to
work
and
looks
for
the
weapons
in
the
armory
of
judicial
contradictions
but
he
keeps
his
own
convictions
as
to
the
case
while
he
does
his
best
to
gain
the
day
in
a
word
a
man
loses
his
head
not
so
much
by
thinking
as
by
uttering
thoughts
the
spoken
word
convinces
the
utterer
but
a
man
can
act
against
his
own
bad
judgment
without
warping
it
and
contrive
to
win
in
a
bad
cause
without
maintaining
that
it
is
a
good
one
like
the
barrister
perhaps
for
this
very
reason
an
old
attorney
is
the
more
likely
of
the
two
to
make
a
good
judge
a
country
attorney
as
we
have
seen
has
plenty
of
excuses
for
his
mediocrity
he
takes
up
the
cause
of
petty
passions
he
undertakes
pettifogging
business
he
lives
by
charging
expenses
he
strains
the
code
of
procedure
and
pleads
in
court
in
a
word
his
weak
points
are
legion
and
if
by
chance
you
come
across
a
remarkable
man
practising
as
a
country
attorney
he
is
indeed
above
the
average
level
i
thought
sir
that
you
sent
for
me
on
your
own
affairs
said
and
a
glance
that
put
an
edge
on
his
words
fell
upon
tall
cointet
impenetrable
blue
spectacles
let
us
have
no
beating
about
the
bush
returned
boniface
cointet
listen
to
me
after
that
beginning
big
with
mysterious
import
cointet
set
himself
down
upon
a
bench
and
beckoned
to
do
likewise
when
du
hautoy
came
to
angouleme
in
on
his
way
to
his
consulship
at
valence
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
mme
de
senonches
then
mlle
zephirine
and
had
a
daughter
by
her
added
cointet
for
the
attorney
ear
yes
he
continued
as
gave
a
start
yes
and
mlle
zephirine
marriage
with
de
senoches
soon
followed
the
birth
of
the
child
the
girl
was
brought
up
in
my
mother
house
she
is
the
mlle
francoise
de
la
haye
in
whom
mme
de
senoches
takes
an
interest
she
is
her
godmother
in
the
usual
style
now
my
mother
farmed
land
belonging
to
old
mme
de
cardanet
mlle
zephirine
grandmother
and
as
she
knew
the
secret
of
the
sole
heiress
of
the
cardanets
and
the
senonches
of
the
older
branch
they
made
me
trustee
for
the
little
sum
which
francois
du
hautoy
meant
for
the
girl
fortune
i
made
my
own
fortune
with
those
ten
thousand
francs
which
amount
to
thirty
thousand
at
the
present
day
mme
de
senonches
is
sure
to
give
the
wedding
clothes
and
some
plate
and
furniture
to
her
goddaughter
now
i
can
put
you
in
the
way
of
marrying
the
girl
my
lad
said
cointet
slapping
on
the
knee
and
when
you
marry
francoise
de
la
haye
you
will
have
a
large
number
of
the
aristocracy
of
angouleme
as
your
clients
this
understanding
between
us
under
the
rose
will
open
up
magnificent
prospects
for
you
your
position
will
be
as
much
as
any
one
could
want
in
fact
they
do
ask
better
i
know
what
is
to
be
done
asked
eagerly
you
have
an
attorney
maitre
cachan
and
moreover
i
shall
not
leave
cachan
at
once
for
you
i
shall
only
be
your
client
later
on
said
cointet
significantly
what
is
to
be
done
do
you
ask
my
friend
eh
why
david
sechard
business
the
poor
devil
has
three
thousand
francs
worth
of
bills
to
meet
he
will
not
meet
them
you
will
stave
off
legal
proceedings
in
such
a
way
as
to
increase
the
expenses
enormously
do
trouble
yourself
go
on
pile
on
items
doublon
my
will
act
under
directions
and
he
will
lay
on
like
a
blacksmith
a
word
to
the
wise
is
sufficient
now
young
man
an
eloquent
pause
followed
and
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
we
have
never
seen
each
other
cointet
resumed
i
have
not
said
a
syllable
to
you
you
know
nothing
about
du
hautoy
nor
mme
de
senonches
nor
mlle
de
la
haye
only
when
the
time
comes
two
months
hence
you
will
propose
for
the
young
lady
if
we
should
want
to
see
each
other
you
will
come
here
after
dark
let
us
have
nothing
in
writing
then
you
mean
to
ruin
sechard
asked
not
exactly
but
he
must
be
in
jail
for
some
time
and
what
is
the
object
do
you
think
that
i
am
noodle
enough
to
tell
you
that
if
you
have
wit
enough
to
find
out
you
will
have
sense
enough
to
hold
your
tongue
old
sechard
has
plenty
of
money
said
he
was
beginning
already
to
enter
into
boniface
cointet
notions
and
foresaw
a
possible
cause
of
failure
so
long
as
the
father
lives
he
will
not
give
his
son
a
farthing
and
the
old
printer
has
no
mind
as
yet
to
send
in
an
order
for
his
funeral
cards
agreed
said
promptly
making
up
his
mind
i
do
ask
you
for
guarantees
i
am
an
attorney
if
any
one
plays
me
a
trick
there
will
be
an
account
to
settle
between
us
the
rogue
will
go
far
thought
cointet
he
bade
the
day
after
this
conference
was
the
of
april
and
the
cointets
presented
the
first
of
the
three
bills
forged
by
lucien
unluckily
the
bill
was
brought
to
poor
mme
sechard
and
she
seeing
at
once
that
the
signature
was
not
in
her
husband
handwriting
sent
for
david
and
asked
him
you
did
not
put
your
name
to
that
bill
did
you
no
said
he
your
brother
was
so
pressed
for
time
that
he
signed
for
me
eve
returned
the
bill
to
the
bank
messenger
sent
by
the
cointets
we
can
not
meet
it
she
said
then
feeling
that
her
strength
was
failing
she
went
up
to
her
room
david
followed
her
go
quickly
to
the
cointets
dear
eve
said
faintly
they
will
have
some
consideration
for
you
beg
them
to
wait
and
call
their
attention
besides
to
the
fact
that
when
cerizet
lease
is
renewed
they
will
owe
you
a
thousand
francs
david
went
forthwith
to
his
enemies
now
any
foreman
may
become
a
master
printer
but
there
are
not
always
the
makings
of
a
good
man
of
business
in
a
skilled
typographer
david
knew
very
little
of
business
when
therefore
with
a
heart
and
a
sensation
of
throttling
david
had
put
his
excuses
badly
enough
and
formulated
his
request
the
answer
this
is
nothing
to
do
with
us
the
bill
has
been
passed
on
to
us
by
metivier
metivier
will
pay
us
apply
to
metivier
cut
him
short
at
once
oh
cried
eve
when
she
heard
the
result
as
soon
as
the
bill
is
returned
to
metivier
we
may
be
easy
at
two
the
next
day
doublon
bailiff
made
protest
for
at
two
a
time
when
the
place
du
murier
is
full
of
people
so
that
though
doublon
was
careful
to
stand
and
chat
at
the
back
door
with
marion
and
kolb
the
news
of
the
protest
was
known
all
over
the
business
world
of
angouleme
that
evening
tall
cointet
had
enjoined
it
upon
master
doublon
to
show
the
sechards
the
greatest
consideration
but
when
all
was
said
and
done
could
the
bailiff
hypocritical
regard
for
appearances
save
eve
and
david
from
the
disgrace
of
a
suspension
of
payment
let
each
judge
for
himself
a
tolerably
long
digression
of
this
kind
will
seem
all
too
short
and
ninety
out
of
every
hundred
readers
shall
seize
with
avidity
upon
details
that
possess
all
the
piquancy
of
novelty
thus
establishing
yet
once
again
the
trust
of
the
axiom
that
there
is
nothing
so
little
known
as
that
which
everybody
is
supposed
to
know
the
law
of
the
land
to
wit
and
of
a
truth
for
the
immense
majority
of
frenchmen
a
minute
description
of
some
part
of
the
machinery
of
banking
will
be
as
interesting
as
any
chapter
of
foreign
travel
when
a
tradesman
living
in
one
town
gives
a
bill
to
another
tradesman
elsewhere
as
david
was
supposed
to
have
done
for
lucien
benefit
the
transaction
ceases
to
be
a
simple
promissory
note
given
in
the
way
of
business
by
one
tradesman
to
another
in
the
same
place
and
becomes
in
some
sort
a
letter
of
exchange
when
therefore
metivier
accepted
lucien
three
bills
he
was
obliged
to
send
them
for
collection
to
his
correspondents
in
angouleme
to
cointet
brothers
that
is
to
say
hence
likewise
a
certain
initial
loss
for
lucien
in
exchange
on
angouleme
taking
the
practical
shape
of
an
abatement
of
so
much
per
cent
over
and
above
the
discount
in
this
way
sechard
bills
had
passed
into
circulation
in
the
bank
you
would
not
believe
how
greatly
the
quality
of
banker
united
with
the
august
title
of
creditor
changes
the
debtor
position
for
instance
when
a
bill
has
been
passed
through
the
bank
please
note
that
expression
and
transferred
from
the
money
market
in
paris
to
the
financial
world
of
angouleme
if
that
bill
is
protested
then
the
bankers
in
angouleme
must
draw
up
a
detailed
account
of
the
expenses
of
protest
and
return
is
a
duty
which
they
owe
to
themselves
joking
apart
no
account
of
the
most
romantic
adventure
could
be
more
mildly
improbable
than
this
of
the
journey
made
by
a
bill
behold
a
certain
article
in
the
code
of
commerce
authorizing
the
most
ingenious
pleasantries
after
mascarille
manner
and
the
interpretation
thereof
shall
make
apparent
manifold
atrocities
lurking
beneath
the
formidable
word
legal
master
doublon
registered
the
protest
and
went
himself
with
it
to
mm
cointet
brothers
the
firm
had
a
standing
account
with
their
bailiff
he
gave
them
six
months
credit
and
the
lynxes
of
angouleme
practically
took
a
twelvemonth
though
tall
cointet
would
say
month
by
month
to
the
lynxes
jackal
do
you
want
any
money
doublon
nor
was
this
all
doublon
gave
the
influential
house
a
rebate
upon
every
transaction
it
was
the
merest
trifle
one
franc
fifty
centimes
on
a
protest
for
instance
tall
cointet
quietly
sat
himself
down
at
his
desk
and
took
out
a
small
sheet
of
paper
with
a
centime
stamp
upon
it
chatting
as
he
did
so
with
doublon
as
to
the
standing
of
some
of
the
local
tradesmen
well
are
you
satisfied
with
young
gannerac
he
is
not
doing
badly
lord
a
carrier
drives
a
trade
drives
a
trade
yes
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
expenses
are
a
heavy

the

that
comes
of

practice
for
the
writer
chatted
with

as
he
wrote
there
appeared
the

of
declaration
we
the
undersigned
postel
of

and

forwarding
agent
merchant
of
this
town
hereby
certify
that
the
present
rate
of

on

is
one
and
a
quarter
per
cent
angouleme
may
here
doublon
be
so
good
as
to
step
round
and
ask
postel
and
gannerac
to
put
their
names
to
this
declaration
and
bring
it
back
with
you
morning
and
doublon
quite
accustomed
as
he
was
to
these
instruments
of
torture
forthwith
went
as
if
it
were
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
evidently
the
protest
might
have
been
sent
in
an
envelope
as
in
paris
and
even
so
all
angouleme
was
sure
to
hear
of
the
poor
sechards
unlucky
predicament
how
they
all
blamed
his
want
of
business
energy
his
excessive
fondness
for
his
wife
had
been
the
ruin
of
him
according
to
some
others
maintained
that
it
was
his
affection
for
his
and
what
shocking
conclusions
did
they
not
draw
from
these
premises
a
man
ought
never
to
embrace
the
interests
of
his
kith
and
kin
old
sechard
conduct
met
with
approval
and
people
admired
him
for
his
treatment
of
his
son
and
now
all
you
who
for
any
reason
whatsoever
should
forget
to
honor
your
engagements
look
well
into
the
methods
of
the
banking
business
by
which
one
thousand
francs
may
be
made
to
pay
interest
at
the
rate
of
francs
in
ten
minutes
without
breaking
the
law
of
the
land
the
thousand
francs
the
one
incontestable
item
in
the
account
comes
first
the
second
item
is
shared
between
the
bailiff
and
the
inland
revenue
department
the
six
francs
due
to
the
state
for
providing
a
piece
of
stamped
paper
and
putting
the
debtor
mortification
on
record
will
probably
ensure
a
long
life
to
this
abuse
and
as
you
already
know
one
franc
fifty
centimes
from
this
item
found
its
way
into
the
banker
pockets
in
the
shape
of
doublon
rebate
bank
charges
per
cent
runs
the
third
item
which
appears
upon
the
ingenious
plea
that
if
a
banker
has
not
received
payment
he
has
for
all
practical
purposes
discounted
a
bill
and
although
the
contrary
may
be
the
case
if
you
fail
to
receive
a
thousand
francs
it
seems
to
be
very
much
the
same
thing
as
if
you
had
paid
them
away
everybody
who
has
discounted
a
bill
knows
that
he
has
to
pay
more
than
the
six
per
cent
fixed
by
law
for
a
small
percentage
appears
under
the
humble
title
of
charges
representing
a
premium
on
the
financial
genius
and
skill
with
which
the
capitalist
puts
his
money
out
to
interest
the
more
money
he
makes
out
of
you
the
more
he
asks
wherefore
it
would
be
undoubtedly
cheaper
to
discount
a
bill
with
a
fool
if
fools
there
be
in
the
profession
of
the
law
requires
the
banker
to
obtain
a
certificate
for
the
rate
of
exchange
when
a
place
is
so
unlucky
as
to
boast
no
stock
exchange
two
merchants
act
instead
this
is
the
significance
of
the
item
brokerage
it
is
a
fixed
charge
of
a
quarter
per
cent
on
the
amount
of
the
protested
bill
the
custom
is
to
consider
the
amount
as
paid
to
the
merchants
who
act
for
the
and
the
banker
quietly
puts
the
money
into
his
so
much
for
the
third
item
in
this
delightful
account
the
fourth
includes
the
cost
of
the
piece
of
stamped
paper
on
which
the
account
itself
appears
as
well
as
the
cost
of
the
stamp
for
as
it
is
ingeniously
named
the
banker
draft
upon
his
colleague
in
paris
the
fifth
is
a
charge
for
postage
and
the
legal
interest
due
upon
the
amount
for
the
time
that
it
may
happen
to
be
absent
from
the
strong
box
the
final
item
the
exchange
is
the
object
for
which
the
bank
exists
which
is
to
say
for
the
transmission
of
sums
of
money
from
one
place
to
another
now
sift
this
account
thoroughly
and
what
do
you
find
the
method
of
calculation
closely
resembles
polichinelle
arithmetic
in
neapolitan
song
fifteen
and
five
make
the
signatures
of
messieurs
postel
and
gannerac
were
obviously
given
to
oblige
in
the
way
of
business
the
cointets
would
act
at
need
for
gannerac
as
gannerac
acted
for
the
cointets
it
was
a
practical
application
of
the
proverb
reach
me
the
rhubarb
and
i
will
pass
you
the
senna
cointet
brothers
moreover
kept
a
standing
account
with
metivier
there
was
no
need
of
a
and
no
was
made
a
returned
bill
between
the
two
firms
simply
meant
a
debit
or
credit
entry
and
another
line
in
a
ledger
this
account
therefore
is
reduced
to
the
one
thousand
francs
with
an
additional
thirteen
francs
for
expenses
of
protest
and
half
per
cent
for
a
month
delay
one
thousand
and
eighteen
francs
it
may
be
in
all
suppose
that
in
a
large
a
bill
for
a
thousand
francs
is
daily
protested
on
an
average
then
the
banker
receives
francs
a
day
by
the
grace
of
god
and
the
constitution
of
the
banking
system
that
all
powerful
invention
due
to
the
jewish
intellect
of
the
middle
ages
which
after
six
centuries
still
controls
monarchs
and
peoples
in
other
words
a
thousand
francs
would
bring
such
a
house
francs
per
day
or
ten
thousand
two
hundred
and
twenty
francs
per
annum
triple
the
average
of
protests
and
consequently
of
expenses
and
you
shall
derive
an
income
of
thirty
thousand
francs
per
annum
interest
upon
purely
fictitious
capital
for
which
reason
nothing
is
more
lovingly
cultivated
than
these
little
accounts
of
expenses
if
david
sechard
had
come
to
pay
his
bill
on
the
of
may
that
is
the
day
after
it
was
protested
mm
cointet
brothers
would
have
met
him
at
once
with
we
have
returned
your
bill
to
metivier
although
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
document
would
have
been
lying
upon
the
desk
a
banker
has
a
right
to
make
out
the
account
of
expenses
on
the
evening
of
the
day
when
the
bill
is
protested
and
he
uses
the
right
to
sweat
the
silver
crowns
in
the
country
banker
phrase
the
kellers
with
correspondents
all
over
the
world
make
twenty
thousand
francs
per
annum
by
charges
for
postage
alone
accounts
of
expenses
of
protest
pay
for
mme
la
baronne
de
nucingen
dresses
opera
box
and
carriage
the
charge
for
postage
is
a
more
shocking
swindle
because
a
house
will
settle
ten
matters
of
business
in
as
many
lines
of
a
single
letter
and
of
the
tithe
wrung
from
misfortune
the
government
strange
to
say
takes
its
share
and
the
national
revenue
is
swelled
by
a
tax
on
commercial
failure
and
the
bank
from
the
august
height
of
a
she
flings
an
observation
full
of
commonsense
at
the
debtor
how
is
it
asks
she
that
you
can
not
meet
your
bill
and
unluckily
there
is
no
reply
to
the
question
wherefore
the
account
of
expenses
is
an
account
bristling
with
dreadful
fictions
fit
to
cause
any
debtor
who
henceforth
shall
reflect
upon
this
instructive
page
a
salutary
shudder
on
the
of
may
metivier
received
the
account
from
cointet
brothers
with
instructions
to
proceed
against
lucien
chardon
otherwise
de
rubempre
with
the
utmost
rigor
of
the
law
eve
also
wrote
to
metivier
and
a
few
days
later
received
an
answer
which
reassured
her
completely
sechard
junior
printer
i
have
duly
received
your
esteemed
favor
of
the
instant
from
your
explanation
of
the
bill
due
on
april
i
understand
that
you
have
obliged
your
de
rubempre
who
is
spending
so
much
that
it
will
be
doing
you
a
service
to
summons
him
his
present
position
is
such
that
he
is
likely
to
delay
payment
for
long
if
your
should
refuse
payment
i
shall
rely
upon
the
credit
of
your
i
sign
myself
now
as
ever
your
obedient
servant
metivier
well
said
eve
commenting
upon
the
letter
to
david
lucien
will
know
when
they
summons
him
that
we
could
not
pay
what
a
change
wrought
in
eve
those
few
words
meant
the
love
that
grew
deeper
as
she
came
to
know
her
husband
character
better
and
better
was
taking
the
place
of
love
for
her
brother
in
her
heart
but
to
how
many
illusions
had
she
not
bade
farewell
and
now
let
us
trace
out
the
whole
history
of
the
bill
and
the
account
of
expenses
in
the
business
world
of
paris
the
law
enacts
that
the
third
holder
the
technical
expression
for
the
third
party
into
whose
hands
the
bill
passes
is
at
liberty
to
proceed
for
the
whole
amount
against
any
one
of
the
various
endorsers
who
appears
to
him
to
be
most
likely
to
make
prompt
payment
metivier
using
this
discretion
served
a
summons
upon
lucien
behold
the
successive
stages
of
the
proceedings
all
of
them
perfectly
futile
metivier
with
the
cointets
behind
him
knew
that
lucien
was
not
in
a
position
to
pay
but
insolvency
in
fact
is
not
insolvency
in
law
until
it
has
been
formally
proved
formal
proof
of
lucien
inability
to
pay
was
obtained
in
the
following
manner
on
the
of
may
metivier
gave
lucien
notice
of
the
protest
and
an
account
of
the
expense
thereof
and
summoned
him
to
appear
before
the
tribunal
of
commerce
or
county
court
of
paris
to
hear
a
vast
number
of
things
this
among
others
that
he
was
liable
to
imprisonment
as
a
merchant
by
the
time
that
lucien
hard
pressed
and
hunted
down
on
all
sides
read
this
jargon
he
received
notice
of
judgment
against
him
by
default
coralie
his
mistress
ignorant
of
the
whole
matter
imagined
that
lucien
had
obliged
his
and
handed
him
all
the
documents
together
too
late
an
actress
sees
so
much
of
bailiffs
duns
and
writs
upon
the
stage
that
she
looks
on
all
stamped
paper
as
a
farce
tears
filled
lucien
eyes
he
was
unhappy
on
sechard
account
he
was
ashamed
of
the
forgery
he
wished
to
pay
he
desired
to
gain
time
naturally
he
took
counsel
of
his
friends
but
by
the
time
lousteau
blondet
bixiou
and
nathan
had
told
the
poet
to
snap
his
fingers
at
a
court
only
established
for
tradesmen
lucien
was
already
in
the
clutches
of
the
law
he
beheld
upon
his
door
the
little
yellow
placard
which
leaves
its
reflection
on
the
porter
countenance
and
exercises
a
most
astringent
influence
upon
credit
striking
terror
into
the
heart
of
the
smallest
tradesman
and
freezing
the
blood
in
the
veins
of
a
poet
susceptible
enough
to
care
about
the
bits
of
wood
silken
rags
dyed
woolen
stuffs
and
multifarious
gimcracks
entitled
furniture
when
the
broker
men
came
for
coralie
furniture
the
author
of
the
fled
to
a
friend
of
bixiou
one
desroches
a
barrister
who
burst
out
laughing
at
the
sight
of
lucien
in
such
a
state
about
nothing
at
all
that
is
nothing
my
dear
fellow
do
you
want
to
gain
time
yes
as
much
possible
very
well
apply
for
stay
of
execution
go
and
look
up
masson
he
is
a
solicitor
in
the
commercial
court
and
a
friend
of
mine
take
your
documents
to
him
he
will
make
a
second
application
for
you
and
give
notice
of
objection
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
there
is
not
the
least
difficulty
you
are
a
journalist
your
name
is
well
known
enough
if
they
summons
you
before
a
civil
court
come
to
me
about
it
that
will
be
my
affair

on
in

civil
court
and
judgment
was
given
before
desroches
expected
it
lucien
creditor
was
pushing
on
the
proceedings
against
him
a
second
execution
was
put
in
and
again
coralie
pilasters
were
gilded
with
placards
desroches
felt
rather
foolish
a
colleague
had
caught
him
napping
to
use
his
own
expression
he
demurred
not
without
reason
that
the
furniture
belonged
to
mlle
coralie
with
whom
lucien
was
living
and
demanded
an
order
for
inquiry
thereupon
the
judge
referred
the
matter
to
the
registrar
for
inquiry
the
furniture
was
proved
to
belong
to
the
actress

judgment

monsieur

junior

sir
your
chardon

so
shamelessly
dishonest
that
he
declares
his
furniture
to
be
the
property
of
an
actress
with
whom
he
is
living
you
ought
to
have
informed
me
candidly
of
these
circumstances

not
have
allowed

to
go

useless
expense

proceedings

you
must
not
therefore
take
it
amiss
if
i
ask
for
immediate
repayment
of
the
three
bills
and
the
expenses
to
which
i
have
been
yours
metivier
eve
had
heard
nothing
during
these
months
and
supposed
in
her
ignorance
of
commercial
law
that
her
brother
had
made
reparation
for
his
sins
by
meeting
the
forged
bills
be
quick
and
go
at
once
to
dear
she
said
tell
him
about
it
and
ask
his
advice
david
hurried
to
his
schoolfellow
office
when
you
came
to
tell
me
of
your
appointment
and
offered
me
your
services
i
did
not
think
that
i
should
need
them
so
soon
he
said
studied
the
fine
face
of
this
man
who
sat
opposite
him
in
the
office
chair
and
scarcely
listened
to
the
details
of
the
case
for
he
knew
more
of
them
already
than
the
speaker
as
soon
as
he
saw
sechard
anxiety
he
said
to
himself
the
trick
has
succeeded
this
kind
of
comedy
is
often
played
in
an
attorney
office
why
are
the
cointets
persecuting
him
wondered
within
himself
for
the
attorney
can
use
his
wit
to
read
his
clients
thoughts
as
clearly
as
the
ideas
of
their
opponents
and
it
is
his
business
to
see
both
sides
of
the
judicial
web
you
want
to
gain
time
he
said
at
last
when
sechard
had
come
to
an
end
how
long
do
you
want
something
like
three
or
four
months
oh
four
months
that
would
be
my
salvation
exclaimed
david
appeared
to
him
as
an
angel
very
well
no
one
shall
lay
hands
on
any
of
your
furniture
and
no
one
shall
arrest
you
for
four
months
but
it
will
cost
you
a
great
deal
said
eh
what
does
that
matter
to
me
cried
sechard
you
are
expecting
some
money
to
come
in
but
are
you
sure
of
it
asked
astonished
at
the
way
in
which
his
client
walked
into
the
toils
in
three
months
time
i
shall
have
plenty
of
money
said
the
inventor
with
an
inventor
hopeful
confidence
your
father
is
still
above
ground
suggested
he
is
in
no
hurry
to
leave
his
vines
do
you
think
that
i
am
counting
on
my
father
death
returned
david
i
am
on
the
track
of
a
trade
secret
the
secret
of
making
a
sheet
of
paper
as
strong
as
dutch
paper
without
a
thread
of
cotton
in
it
and
at
a
cost
of
fifty
per
cent
less
than
cotton
pulp
there
is
a
fortune
in
that
exclaimed
he
knew
now
what
the
tall
cointet
meant
a
large
fortune
my
friend
for
in
ten
years
time
the
demand
for
paper
will
be
ten
times
larger
than
it
is
journalism
will
be
the
craze
of
our
day
nobody
knows
your
secret
nobody
except
my
wife
you
have
not
told
any
one
what
you
mean
to
do
the
cointets
for
example
i
did
say
something
about
it
but
in
general
terms
i
think
a
sudden
spark
of
generosity
flashed
through
rancorous
soul
he
tried
to
reconcile
sechard
interests
with
the
projects
and
his
own
listen
david
we
are
old
schoolfellows
you
and
i
i
will
fight
your
case
but
understand
this
clearly
the
defence
in
the
teeth
of
the
law
will
cost
you
five
or
six
thousand
francs
do
not
compromise
your
prospects
i
think
you
will
be
compelled
to
share
the
profits
of
your
invention
with
some
one
of
our
paper
manufacturers
let
us
see
now
you
will
think
twice
before
you
buy
or
build
a
paper
mill
and
there
is
the
cost
of
the
patent
besides
all
this
means
time
and
money
too
the
servers
of
writs
will
be
down
upon
you
too
soon
perhaps
although
we
are
going
to
give
them
the
slip
i
have
my
secret
said
david
with
the
simplicity
of
the
man
of
books
well
and
good
your
secret
will
be
your
plank
of
safety
said
his
first
loyal
intention
of
avoiding
a
lawsuit
by
a
compromise
was
frustrated
i
do
not
wish
to
know
it
but
mind
this
that
i
tell
you
work
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
if
you
can
so
that
no
one
may
watch
you
and
gain
a
hint
from
your
ways
of
working
or
your
plank
will
be
stolen
from
under
your
feet
an
inventor
and
a
simpleton
often
live
in
the
same
skin
your
mind
runs
so
much
on
your
secrets
that
you
can
not
think
of
everything
people
will
begin
to
have
their
suspicions
at
last
and
the
place
is
full
of
paper
manufacturers
so
many
manufacturers
so
many
enemies
for
you
you
are
like
a
beaver
with
the
hunters
about
you
do
not
give
them
your
skin
thank
you
dear
fellow
i
have
told
myself
all
this
exclaimed
sechard
but
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
showing
so
much
concern
for
me
and
for
your
forethought
it
does
not
really
matter
to
me
myself
an
income
of
twelve
hundred
francs
would
be
enough
for
me
and
my
father
ought
by
rights
to
leave
me
three
times
as
much
some
day
love
and
thought
make
up
my
life
a
divine
life
i
am
working
for
lucien
sake
and
for
my
wife
come
give
me
this
power
of
attorney
and
think
of
nothing
but
your
discovery
if
there
should
be
any
danger
of
arrest
i
will
let
you
know
in
time
for
we
must
think
of
all
possibilities
and
let
me
tell
you
again
to
allow
no
one
of
whom
you
are
not
so
sure
as
you
are
of
yourself
to
come
into
your
place
cerizet
did
not
care
to
continue
the
lease
of
the
plant
and
premises
hence
our
little
money
difficulties
we
have
no
one
at
home
now
but
marion
and
kolb
an
alsacien
as
trusty
as
a
dog
and
my
wife
and
her
mother
one
word
said
do
trust
that
dog
you
do
not
know
him
exclaimed
david
he
is
like
a
second
self
may
i
try
him
yes
said
sechard
there
but
send
mme
sechard
to
me
i
must
have
a
power
of
attorney
from
your
wife
and
bear
in
mind
my
friend
that
there
is
a
fire
burning
in
your
affairs
said
by
way
of
warning
of
all
the
troubles
gathering
in
the
law
courts
to
burst
upon
head
here
am
i
with
one
foot
in
burgundy
and
the
other
in
champagne
he
added
to
himself
as
he
closed
the
office
door
on
david
harassed
by
money
difficulties
beset
with
fears
for
his
health
stung
to
the
quick
by
lucien
disgrace
david
had
worked
on
at
his
problem
he
had
been
trying
to
find
a
single
process
to
replace
the
various
operations
of
pounding
and
maceration
to
which
all
flax
or
cotton
or
rags
any
vegetable
fibre
in
fact
must
be
subjected
and
as
he
went
to
office
he
abstractedly
chewed
a
bit
of
nettle
stalk
that
had
been
steeping
in
water
on
his
way
home
tolerably
satisfied
with
his
interview
he
felt
a
little
pellet
sticking
between
his
teeth
he
laid
it
on
his
hand
flattened
it
out
and
saw
that
the
pulp
was
far
superior
to
any
previous
result
the
want
of
cohesion
is
the
great
drawback
of
all
vegetable
fibre
straw
for
instance
yields
a
very
brittle
paper
which
may
almost
be
called
metallic
and
resonant
these
chances
only
befall
bold
inquirers
into
nature
methods
now
said
he
to
himself
i
must
contrive
to
do
by
machinery
and
some
chemical
agency
the
thing
that
i
myself
have
done
unconsciously
when
his
wife
saw
him
his
face
was
radiant
with
belief
in
victory
there
were
traces
of
tears
in
eve
face
oh
my
darling
do
not
trouble
yourself
will
guarantee
that
we
shall
not
be
molested
for
several
months
to
come
there
will
be
a
good
deal
of
expense
over
it
but
as
said
when
he
came
to
the
door
with
me
frenchman
has
a
right
to
keep
his
creditors
waiting
provided
he
repays
them
capital
interest
and
costs
very
well
then
we
shall
do
that
and
live
meanwhile
asked
poor
eve
who
thought
of
everything
ah
that
is
true
said
david
carrying
his
hand
to
his
ear
after
the
unaccountable
fashion
of
most
perplexed
mortals
mother
will
look
after
little
lucien
and
i
can
go
back
to
work
again
said
she
eve
oh
my
eve
cried
david
holding
his
wife
closely
to
at
saintes
not
very
far
from
here
in
the
sixteenth
century
there
lived
one
of
the
very
greatest
of
frenchmen
for
he
was
not
merely
the
inventor
of
glaze
he
was
the
glorious
precursor
of
buffon
and
cuvier
besides
he
was
the
first
geologist
good
simple
soul
that
he
was
bernard
palissy
endured
the
martyrdom
appointed
for
all
seekers
into
secrets
but
his
wife
and
children
and
all
his
neighbors
were
against
him
his
wife
used
to
sell
his
tools
nobody
understood
him
he
wandered
about
the
countryside
he
was
hunted
down
they
jeered
at
him
but
i
am
loved
dearly
loved
said
eve
with
the
quiet
serenity
of
the
love
that
is
sure
of
itself
and
so
may
well
endure
all
that
poor
bernard
palissy
suffered
bernard
palissy
the
discoverer
of
ecouen
ware
the
huguenot
excepted
by
charles
ix
on
the
day
of
he
lived
to
be
rich
and
honored
in
his
old
age
and
lectured
on
the
of
earths
as
he
called
it
in
the
face
of
europe
so
long
as
my
fingers
can
hold
an
iron
you
shall
want
for
nothing
cried
the
poor
wife
in
tones
that
told
of
the
deepest
devotion
when
i
was
mme
prieur
forewoman
i
had
a
friend
among
the
girls
basine
clerget
a
cousin
of
postel
a
very
good
child
well
basine
told
me
the
other
day
when
she
brought
back
the
linen
that
she
was
taking
mme
prieur
business
i
will
work
for
her
ah
you
shall
not
work
there
for
long
said
david
i
have
found
out
eve
watching
his
face
saw
the
sublime
belief
in
success
which
sustains
the
inventor
the
belief
that
gives
him
courage
to
go
forth
into
the
virgin
forests
of
the
country
of
discovery
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
answered
that
confident
look
with
a
smile
david
bent
his
head
mournfully
oh
my
dear
i
am
not
laughing
i
did
not
doubt
it
was
not
a
sneer
cried
eve
on
her
knees
before
her
husband
but
i
see
plainly
now
that
you
were
right
to
tell
me
nothing
about
your
experiments
and
your
hopes
ah
yes
dear
an
inventor
should
endure
the
long
painful
travail
of
a
great
idea
alone
he
should
not
utter
a
word
of
it
even
to
his
wife
a
woman
is
a
woman
still
this
eve
of
yours
could
not
help
smiling
when
she
heard
you
say
have
found
out
for
the
seventeenth
time
this
month
david
burst
out
laughing
so
heartily
at
his
own
expense
that
eve
caught
his
hand
in
hers
and
kissed
it
reverently
it
was
a
delicious
moment
for
them
both
one
of
those
roses
of
love
and
tenderness
that
grow
beside
the
desert
paths
of
the
bitterest
poverty
nay
at
times
in
yet
darker
depths
as
the
storm
of
misfortune
grew
eve
courage
redoubled
the
greatness
of
her
husband
nature
his
inventor
simplicity
the
tears
that
now
and
again
she
saw
in
the
eyes
of
this
dreamer
of
dreams
with
the
tender
heart
all
these
things
aroused
in
her
an
unsuspected
energy
of
resistance
once
again
she
tried
the
plan
that
had
succeeded
so
well
already
she
wrote
to
metivier
reminding
him
that
the
printing
office
was
for
sale
offered
to
pay
him
out
of
the
proceeds
and
begged
him
not
to
ruin
david
with
needless
costs
metivier
received
the
heroic
letter
and
shammed
dead
his
replied
that
in
the
absence
of
metivier
he
could
not
take
it
upon
himself
to
stay
proceedings
for
his
employer
had
made
it
a
rule
to
let
the
law
take
its
course
eve
wrote
again
offering
this
time
to
renew
the
bills
and
pay
all
the
costs
hitherto
incurred
to
this
the
clerk
consented
provided
that
sechard
senior
guaranteed
payment
so
eve
walked
over
to
marsac
taking
kolb
and
her
mother
with
her
she
braved
the
old
vinedresser
and
so
charming
was
she
that
the
old
man
face
relaxed
and
the
puckers
smoothed
out
at
the
sight
of
her
but
when
with
inward
quakings
she
came
to
speak
of
a
guarantee
she
beheld
a
sudden
and
complete
change
of
the
tippleographic
countenance
if
i
allowed
my
son
to
put
his
hand
to
the
lips
of
my
cash
box
whenever
he
had
a
mind
he
would
plunge
it
deep
into
the
vitals
he
would
take
all
i
have
cried
old
sechard
that
is
the
way
with
children
they
eat
up
their
parents
purse
what
did
i
do
myself
eh
never
cost
my
parents
a
farthing
your
printing
office
is
standing
idle
the
rats
and
the
mice
do
all
the
printing
that
is
done
in
it
you
have
a
pretty
face
i
am
very
fond
of
you
you
are
a
careful
woman
but
that
son
of
mine
do
you
know
what
david
is
i
tell
you
he
is
a
scholar
that
will
never
do
a
stroke
of
work
if
i
had
reared
him
as
i
was
reared
myself
without
knowing
his
letters
and
if
i
had
made
a
of
him
like
his
father
before
him
he
would
have
money
saved
and
put
out
to
interest
by
now
oh
he
is
my
cross
that
fellow
is
look
you
and
unluckily
he
is
all
the
family
i
have
for
there
is
never
like
to
be
a
later
edition
and
when
he
makes
you
unhappy
eve
protested
with
a
vehement
gesture
of
denial
yes
he
does
affirmed
old
sechard
you
had
to
find
a
for
the
child
come
come
i
know
all
about
it
you
are
in
the
county
court
and
the
whole
town
is
talking
about
you
i
was
only
a
have
no
book
learning
was
not
foreman
at
the
didots
the
first
printers
in
the
world
but
yet
i
never
set
eyes
on
a
bit
of
stamped
paper
do
you
know
what
i
say
to
myself
as
i
go
to
and
fro
among
my
vines
looking
after
them
and
getting
in
my
vintage
and
doing
my
bits
of
business
i
say
to
myself
are
taking
a
lot
of
trouble
poor
old
chap
working
to
pile
one
silver
crown
on
another
you
will
leave
a
fine
property
behind
you
and
the
bailiffs
and
the
lawyers
will
get
it
all
or
else
it
will
go
in
nonsensical
notions
and
crotchets
look
you
here
child
you
are
the
mother
of
yonder
little
lad
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
held
him
at
the
font
with
mme
chardon
that
i
could
see
his
old
grandfather
copper
nose
on
his
face
very
well
think
less
of
sechard
and
more
of
that
little
rascal
i
can
trust
no
one
but
you
you
will
prevent
him
from
squandering
my
property
my
poor
property
but
dear
papa
sechard
your
son
will
be
a
credit
to
you
you
will
see
he
will
make
money
and
be
a
rich
man
one
of
these
days
and
wear
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
at
his
buttonhole
what
is
he
going
to
do
to
get
it
you
will
see
but
meanwhile
would
a
thousand
crowns
ruin
you
a
thousand
crowns
would
put
an
end
to
the
proceedings
well
if
you
can
not
trust
him
lend
the
money
to
me
i
will
pay
it
back
you
could
make
it
a
charge
on
my
portion
on
my
earnings
then
has
some
one
brought
david
into
a
court
of
law
cried
the
vinedresser
amazed
to
find
that
the
gossip
was
really
true
see
what
comes
of
knowing
how
to
write
your
name
and
how
about
my
rent
oh
little
girl
i
must
go
to
angouleme
at
once
and
ask
cachan
advice
and
see
that
i
am
straight
you
did
right
well
to
come
over
forewarned
is
forearmed
after
two
hours
of
argument
eve
was
fain
to
go
defeated
by
the
unanswerable
women
never
understand
business
she
had
come
with
a
faint
hope
she
went
back
again
almost
heartbroken
and
reached
home
just
in
time
to
receive
notice
of
judgment
sechard
must
pay
metivier
in
full
the
appearance
of
a
bailiff
at
a
house
door
is
an
event
in
a
country
town
and
doublon
had
come
far
too
often
of
late
the
whole
neighborhood
was
talking
about
the
sechards
eve
dared
not
leave
her
house
she
dreaded
to
hear
the
whispers
as
she
passed
oh
my
brother
my
brother
cried
poor
eve
as
she
hurried
into
the
passage
and
up
the
stairs
i
can
never
forgive
you
unless
it
was
alas
it
was
that
or
suicide
said
david
who
had
followed
her
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
she
said
quietly
the
woman
who
dragged
him
down
into
the
depths
of
paris
has
much
to
answer
for
and
your
father
my
david
is
quite
inexorable
let
us
bear
it
in
silence
a
discreet
rapping
at
the
door
cut
short
some
word
of
love
on
lips
marion
appeared
towing
the
big
burly
kolb
after
her
across
the
outer
room
madame
said
marion
we
have
known
kolb
and
i
that
you
and
the
master
were
very
much
put
about
and
as
we
have
eleven
hundred
francs
of
savings
between
us
we
thought
we
could
not
do
better
than
put
them
in
the
mistress
hands
die
misdress
echoed
kolb
fervently
kolb
cried
david
you
and
i
will
never
part
pay
a
thousand
francs
on
account
to
maitre
cachan
and
take
a
receipt
for
it
we
will
keep
the
rest
and
kolb
no
power
on
earth
must
extract
a
word
from
you
as
to
my
work
or
my
absences
from
home
or
the
things
you
may
see
me
bring
back
and
if
i
send
you
to
look
for
plants
for
me
you
know
no
human
being
must
set
eyes
on
you
they
will
try
to
corrupt
you
my
good
kolb
they
will
offer
you
thousands
perhaps
tens
of
thousands
of
francs
to
tell

offer

cried
kolb
but
not
ein

and
know
my
orders
well
you

warned
march
and
ask
to
go
with
you
as
witness
yes
said
the
alsacien
some
tay
i
hope
to
be
rich
enough
to
dust
der
chacket
of
dat
man
of
law
i
do
like
his
gountenance
kolb
is
a
good
man
madame
said
big
marion
he
is
as
strong
as
a
turk
and
as
meek
as
a
lamb
just
the
one
that
would
make
a
woman
happy
it
was
his
notion
too
to
invest
our
savings
this
way
as
he
calls
them
poor
man
if
he
does
speak
right
he
thinks
right
and
i
understand
him
all
the
same
he
has
a
notion
of
working
for
somebody
else
so
as
to
save
us
his
keep
surely
we
shall
be
rich
if
it
is
only
to
repay
these
good
folk
said
david
looking
at
his
wife
eve
thought
it
quite
simple
it
was
no
surprise
to
her
to
find
other
natures
on
a
level
with
her
own
the
dullest
nay
the
most
indifferent
observer
could
have
seen
all
the
beauty
of
her
nature
in
her
way
of
receiving
this
service
you
will
be
rich
some
day
dear
master
said
marion
your
bread
is
ready
baked
your
father
has
just
bought
another
farm
he
is
putting
by
money
for
you
that
he
is
and
under
the
circumstances
did
not
marion
show
an
exquisite
delicacy
of
feeling
by
belittling
as
it
were
her
kindness
in
this
way
french
procedure
like
all
things
human
has
its
defects
nevertheless
the
sword
of
justice
being
a
weapon
is
excellently
adapted
alike
for
attack
or
defence
procedure
moreover
has
its
amusing
side
for
when
opposed
lawyers
arrive
at
an
understanding
as
they
well
may
do
without
exchanging
a
word
through
their
manner
of
conducting
their
case
a
suit
becomes
a
kind
of
war
waged
on
the
lines
laid
down
by
the
first
marshal
biron
who
at
the
siege
of
rouen
it
may
be
remembered
received
his
son
project
for
taking
the
city
in
two
days
with
the
remark
you
must
be
in
a
great
hurry
to
go
and
plant
cabbages
let
two
spare
their
troops
as
much
as
possible
let
them
imitate
the
austrian
generals
who
give
the
men
time
to
eat
their
soup
though
they
fail
to
effect
a
juncture
and
escape
reprimand
from
the
aulic
council
let
them
avoid
all
decisive
measures
and
they
shall
carry
on
a
war
for
ever
maitre
cachan
and
doublon
did
better
than
the
austrian
generals
they
took
for
their
example
quintus
fabius
cunctator
the
austrian
of
antiquity
malignant
as
a
mule
was
not
long
in
finding
out
all
the
advantages
of
his
position
no
sooner
had
boniface
cointet
guaranteed
his
costs
than
he
vowed
to
lead
cachan
a
dance
and
to
dazzle
the
paper
manufacturer
with
a
brilliant
display
of
genius
in
the
creation
of
items
to
be
charged
to
metivier
unluckily
for
the
fame
of
the
young
forensic
figaro
the
writer
of
this
history
is
obliged
to
pass
over
the
scene
of
his
exploits
in
as
great
a
hurry
as
if
he
trod
on
burning
coals
but
a
single
bill
of
costs
in
the
shape
of
the
specimen
sent
from
paris
will
no
doubt
suffice
for
the
student
of
contemporary
manners
let
us
follow
the
example
set
us
by
the
bulletins
of
the
grande
armee
and
give
a
summary
of
valiant
feats
and
exploits
in
the
province
of
pure
law
they
will
be
the
better
appreciated
for
concise
treatment
david
sechard
was
summoned
before
the
tribunal
of
commerce
at
angouleme
for
the
of
july
made
default
and
notice
of
judgment
was
served
on

and
attempted
to
put

applied
for
an
interpleader
summons
and
served
notice
on
metivier
for
that
day
fortnight
metivier
made
application
for
a
hearing
without
delay
and
on
the
sechard
application
was
dismissed
hard
upon
this
followed
notice
of
judgment
authorizing
the
issue
of
an
execution
warrant
on

a
warrant
of
arrest
on
the
and
bailiff
inventory
previous
to
the
execution
on
the
metivier
doublon
cachan
company
were
proceeding
at
this
furious
pace
when
suddenly
pulled
them
up
and
stayed
execution
by
lodging
notice
of
appeal
on
the
notice
of
appeal
duly
reiterated
on
the
of
july
drew
metivier
off
to
poitiers
come
said
to
himself
there
we
are
likely
to
stop
for
some
time
to
come
no
sooner
was
the
storm
passed
over
to
poitiers
and
an
attorney
practising
in
the
instructed
to
defend
the
case
than
a
champion
facing
both
ways
made
application
in
mme
sechard
name
for
the
immediate
separation
of
her
estate
from
her
husband
using
all
diligence
in
legal
language
to
such
purpose
that
he
obtained
an
order
from
the
court
on
the
and
inserted
notice
at
once
in
the
now
david
the
lover
had
settled
ten
thousand
francs
upon
his
wife
in
the
marriage
contract
making
over
to
her
as
security
the
fixtures
of
the
printing
office
and
the
household
furniture
and
therefore
constituted
mme
sechard
her
husband
creditor
for
that
small
amount
drawing
up
a
statement
of
her
claims
on
the
estate
in
the
presence
of
a
notary
on
the
of
august
while
was
busy
securing
the
household
property
of
his
clients
he
gained
the
day
at
poitiers
on
the
point
of
law
on
which
the
demurrer
and
appeals
were
based
he
held
that
as
the
court
of
the
seine
had
ordered
the
plaintiff
to
pay
costs
of
proceedings
in
the
paris
commercial
court
david
was
so
much
the
less
liable
for
expenses
of
litigation
incurred
upon
lucien
account
the
took
this
view
of
the
case
and
judgment
was
entered
accordingly
david
sechard
was
ordered
to
pay
the
amount
in
dispute
in
the
angouleme
court
less
the
law
expenses
incurred
in
paris
these
metivier
must
pay
and
each
side
must
bear
its
own
costs
in
the
appeal
to
the
david
sechard
was
duly
notified
of
the
result
on
the
of
august
on
the
the
judgment
took
the
practical
shape
of
an
order
to
pay
capital
interest
and
costs
followed
up
by
notice
of
an
execution
for
the
morrow
upon
this
intervened
and
put
in
a
claim
for
the
furniture
as
the
wife
property
duly
separated
from
her
husband
and
what
was
more
produced
sechard
senior
upon
the
scene
of
action
the
old
vinegrower
had
become
his
client
on
this
wise
he
came
to
angouleme
on
the
day
after
eve
visit
and
went
to
maitre
cachan
for
advice
his
son
owed
him
arrears
of
rent
how
could
he
come
by
this
rent
in
the
scrimmage
in
which
his
son
was
engaged
i
am
engaged
by
the
other
side
pronounced
cachan
and
i
can
not
appear
for
the
father
when
i
am
suing
the
son
but
go
to
he
is
very
clever
he
may
perhaps
do
even
better
for
you
than
i
should
do
cachan
and
met
at
the
court
i
have
sent
you
sechard
senior
said
cachan
take
the
case
for
me
in
exchange
lawyers
do
each
other
services
of
this
kind
in
country
towns
as
well
as
in
paris
the
day
after
sechard
senior
gave
his
confidence
the
tall
cointet
paid
a
visit
to
his
confederate
try
to
give
old
sechard
a
lesson
he
said
he
is
the
kind
of
man
that
will
never
forgive
his
son
for
costing
him
a
thousand
francs
or
so
the
outlay
will
dry
up
any
generous
thoughts
in
his
mind
if
he
ever
has
any
go
back
to
your
vines
said
to
his
new
client
your
son
is
not
very
well
off
do
not
eat
him
out
of
house
and
home
i
will
send
for
you
when
the
time
comes
on
behalf
of
sechard
senior
therefore
claimed
that
the
presses
being
fixtures
were
so
much
the
more
to
be
regarded
as
tools
and
implements
of
trade
and
the
less
liable
to
seizure
in
that
the
house
had
been
a
printing
office
since
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
cachan
on
metivier
account
waxed
indignant
at
this
in
paris
furniture
had
belonged
to
coralie
and
here
again
in
angouleme
goods
and
chattels
all
belonged
to
his
wife
or
his
father
pretty
things
were
said
in
court
father
and
son
were
summoned
such
claims
could
not
be
allowed
to
stand
we
mean
to
unmask
the
frauds
intrenched
behind
bad
faith
of
the
most
formidable
kind
here
is
the
defence
of
dishonesty
bristling
with
the
plainest
and
most
innocent
articles
of
the
code
and
why
to
avoid
repayment
of
three
thousand
francs
obtained
how
from
poor
metivier
cash
box
and
yet
there
are
those
who
dare
to
say
a
word
against
what
times
we
live
in
now
i
put
it
to
you
what
is
this
but
taking
your
neighbor
money
you
will
surely
not
sanction
a
claim
which
would
bring
immorality
to
the
very
core
of
justice
cachan
eloquence
produced
an
effect
on
the
court
a
divided
judgment
was
given
in
favor
of
mme
sechard
the
house
furniture
being
held
to
be
her
property
and
against
sechard
senior
who
was
ordered
to
pay
costs
four
hundred
and
francs
centimes
it
is
kind
of
old
sechard
laughed
the
lawyers
he
would
have
a
finger
in
the
pie
so
let
him
pay
notice
of
judgment
was
given
on
the
of
august
the
presses
and
plant
could
be
seized
on
the
placards
were
posted
application
was
made
for
an
order
empowering
them
to
sell
on
the
spot
announcements
of
the
sale
appeared
in
the
papers
and
doublon
flattered
himself
that
the
inventory
should
be
verified
and
the
auction
take
place
on
the
of
september
by
this
time
david
sechard
owed
metivier
five
thousand
two
hundred
and
francs
centimes
to
say
nothing
of
interest
by
formal
judgment
confirmed
by
appeal
the
bill
of
costs
having
been
duly
taxed
likewise
to
he
owed
twelve
hundred
francs
exclusive
of
the
fees
which
were
left
to
david
generosity
with
the
generous
confidence
displayed
by
the
hackney
coachman
who
has
driven
you
so
quickly
over
the
road
on
which
you
desire
to
go
mme
sechard
owed
something
like
three
hundred
and
fifty
francs
and
fees
besides
and
of
old
sechard
besides
four
hundred
and
francs
centimes
the
little
attorney
demanded
a
hundred
crowns
by
way
of
fee
altogether
the
sechard
family
owed
about
ten
thousand
francs
this
is
what
is
called
putting
fire
into
the
bed
straw
apart
from
the
utility
of
these
documents
to
other
nations
who
thus
may
behold
the
battery
of
french
law
in
action
the
french
legislator
ought
to
know
the
lengths
to
which
the
abuse
of
procedure
may
be
carried
always
supposing
that
the
said
legislator
can
find
time
for
reading
surely
some
sort
of
regulation
might
be
devised
some
way
of
forbidding
lawyers
to
carry
on
a
case
until
the
sum
in
dispute
is
more
than
eaten
up
in
costs
is
there
not
something
ludicrous
in
the
idea
of
submitting
a
square
yard
of
soil
and
an
estate
of
thousands
of
acres
to
the
same
legal
formalities
these
bare
outlines
of
the
history
of
the
various
stages
of
procedure
should
open
the
eyes
of
frenchmen
to
the
meaning
of
the
words
legal
formalities
justice
and
costs
little
as
the
immense
majority
of
the
nations
know
about
them
five
thousand
pounds
weight
of
type
in
the
printing
office
were
worth
two
thousand
francs
as
old
metal
the
three
presses
were
valued
at
six
hundred
francs
the
rest
of
the
plant
would
fetch
the
price
of
old
iron
and
firewood
the
household
furniture
would
have
brought
in
a
thousand
francs
at
most
the
whole
personal
property
of
sechard
junior
therefore
represented
the
sum
of
four
thousand
francs
and
cachan
and
made
claims
for
seven
thousand
francs
in
costs
already
incurred
to
say
nothing
of
expenses
to
come
for
the
blossom
gave
promise
of
fine
fruits
enough
as
the
reader
will
shortly
see
surely
the
lawyers
of
france
and
navarre
nay
even
of
normandy
herself
will
not
refuse
his
meed
of
admiration
and
respect
surely
too
kind
hearts
will
give
marion
and
kolb
a
tear
of
sympathy
all
through
the
war
kolb
sat
on
a
chair
in
the
doorway
acting
as
when
david
had
nothing
else
for
him
to
do
it
was
kolb
who
received
all
the
notifications
and
a
clerk
of
kept
watch
over
kolb
no
sooner
were
the
placards
announcing
the
auction
put
up
on
the
premises
than
kolb
tore
them
down
he
hurried
round
the
town
after
the
tearing
the
placards
from
the
walls
ah
scountrels
he
cried
to
dorment
so
goot
a
man
and
they
calls
it
chustice
marion
made
half
a
franc
a
day
by
working
half
time
in
a
paper
mill
as
a
machine
tender
and
her
wages
contributed
to
the
support
of
the
household
mme
chardon
went
back
uncomplainingly
to
her
old
occupation
sitting
up
night
after
night
and
bringing
home
her
wages
at
the
end
of
the
week
poor
mme
chardon
twice
already
she
had
made
a
nine
days
prayer
for
those
she
loved
wondering
that
god
should
be
deaf
to
her
petitions
and
blind
to
the
light
of
the
candles
on
his
altar
on
the
of
september
a
letter
came
from
lucien
the
first
since
the
letter
of
the
winter
which
david
had
kept
from
his
knowledge
the
announcement
of
the
three
bills
which
bore
signature
this
time
lucien
wrote
to
eve
the
third
since
he
left
us
she
said
poor
sister
she
was
afraid
to
open
the
envelope
that
covered
the
fatal
sheet
she
was
feeding
the
little
one
when
the
post
came
in
they
could
not
afford
a
now
and
the
child
was
being
brought
up
by
hand
her
state
of
mind
may
be
imagined
and
david
also
when
he
had
been
roused
to
read
the
letter
for
david
had
been
at
work
all
night
and
only
lay
down
at
daybreak
to
paris
august
my
dear
sister
two
days
ago
at
five
in
the
morning
one
of
god
noblest
creatures
breathed
her
last
in
my
arms
she
was
the
one
woman
on
earth
capable
of
loving
me
as
you
and
mother
and
david
love
me
giving
me
besides
that
unselfish
affection
something
that
neither
mother
nor
sister
can
give
the
utmost
bliss
of
love
poor
coralie
after
giving
up
everything
for
my
sake
may
perhaps
have
died
for
me
for
me
who
at
this
moment
have
not
the
wherewithal
to
bury
her
she
could
have
solaced
my
life
you
and
you
alone
my
dear
good
angels
can
console
me
for
her
death
god
has
forgiven
her
i
think
the
innocent
girl
for
she
died
like
a
christian
oh
this
paris
eve
paris
is
the
glory
and
the
shame
of
france
many
illusions
i
have
lost
here
already
and
i
have
others
yet
to
lose
when
i
begin
to
beg
for
the
little
money
needed
before
i
can
lay
the
body
of
my
angel
in
consecrated
earth
your
unhappy
brother
lucien
i
must
have
given
you
much
trouble
by
my
heedlessness
some
day
you
will
know
all
and
you
will
forgive
me
you
must
be
quite
easy
now
a
worthy
merchant
a
camusot
to
whom
i
once
caused
cruel
pangs
promised
to
arrange
everything
seeing
that
coralie
and
i
were
so
much
distressed
the
sheet
is
still
moist
with
his
tears
said
eve
looking
at
the
letter
with
a
heart
so
full
of
sympathy
that
something
of
the
old
love
for
lucien
shone
in
her
eyes
poor
fellow
he
must
have
suffered
cruelly
if
he
has
been
loved
as
he
says
exclaimed
eve
husband
happy
in
his
love
and
these
two
forgot
all
their
own
troubles
at
this
cry
of
a
supreme
sorrow
just
at
that
moment
marion
rushed
in
madame
she
panted
here
they
are
here
they
are
who
is
here
doublon
and
his
men
bad
luck
to
them
kolb
will
not
let
them
come
in
they
have
come
to
sell
us
up
no
no
they
are
not
going
to
sell
you
up
never
fear
cried
a
voice
in
the
next
room
and
appeared
upon
the
scene
i
have
just
lodged
notice
of
appeal
we
ought
not
to
sit
down
under
a
judgment
that
attaches
a
stigma
of
bad
faith
to
us
i
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
fight
the
case
here
i
let
cachan
talk
to
gain
time
for
you
i
am
sure
of
gaining
the
day
at
poitiers
but
how
much
will
it
cost
to
win
the
day
asked
mme
sechard
fees
if
you
win
one
thousand
francs
if
we
lose
our
case
oh
dear
cried
poor
eve
why
the
remedy
is
worse
than
the
disease
was
not
a
little
confused
at
this
cry
of
innocence
enlightened
by
the
progress
of
the
flames
of
litigation
it
struck
him
too
that
eve
was
a
very
beautiful
woman
in
the
middle
of
the
discussion
old
sechard
arrived
summoned
by
the
old
presence
in
the
chamber
where
his
little
grandson
in
the
cradle
lay
smiling
at
misfortune
completed
the
scene
the
young
attorney
at
once
addressed
the
newcomer
with
you
owe
me
seven
hundred
francs
for
the
interpleader
papa
sechard
but
you
can
charge
the
amount
to
your
son
in
addition
to
the
arrears
of
rent
the
vinedresser
felt
the
sting
of
the
sarcasm
conveyed
by
tone
and
manner
it
would
have
cost
you
less
to
give
security
for
the
debt
at
first
said
eve
leaving
the
cradle
to
greet
her
with
a
kiss
david
quite
overcome
by
the
sight
of
the
crowd
outside
the
house
for
kolb
resistance
to
doublon
men
had
collected
a
knot
of
people
could
only
hold
out
a
hand
to
his
father
he
did
not
say
a
word
and
how
pray
do
i
come
to
owe
you
seven
hundred
francs
the
old
man
asked
looking
at
why
in
the
first
place
i
am
engaged
by
you
your
rent
is
in
question
so
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
you
and
our
debtor
are
one
and
the
same
person
if
your
son
does
not
pay
my
costs
in
the
case
you
must
pay
them
but
this
is
nothing
in
a
few
hours
david
will
be
put
in
prison
will
you
allow
him
to
go
what
does
he
owe
something
like
five
or
six
thousand
francs
besides
the
amounts
owing
to
you
and
to
his
wife
the
speech
roused
all
the
old
man
suspicions
at
once
he
looked
round
the
little
bedroom
at
the
touching
scene
before
his
eyes
at
a
beautiful
woman
weeping
over
a
cradle
at
david
bowed
down
by
anxieties
and
then
again
at
the
lawyer
this
was
a
trap
set
for
him
by
that
lawyer
perhaps
they
wanted
to
work
upon
his
paternal
feelings
to
get
money
out
of
him
that
was
what
it
all
meant
he
took
alarm
he
went
over
to
the
cradle
and
fondled
the
child
who
held
out
both
little
arms
to
him
no
heir
to
an
english
peerage
could
be
more
tenderly
cared
for
than
this
little
one
in
that
house
of
trouble
his
little
embroidered
cap
was
lined
with
pale
pink
eh
let
david
get
out
of
it
as
best
he
may
i
am
thinking
of
this
child
here
cried
the
old
grandfather
and
the
child
mother
will
approve
of
that
david
that
knows
so
much
must
know
how
to
pay
his
debts
now
i
will
just
put
your
meaning
into
plain
language
said
ironically
look
here
papa
sechard
you
are
jealous
of
your
son
hear
the
truth
you
put
david
into
his
present
position
by
selling
the
business
to
him
for
three
times
its
value
you
ruined
him
to
make
an
extortionate
bargain
yes
do
you
shake
your
head
you
sold
the
newspaper
to
the
cointets
and
pocketed
all
the
proceeds
and
that
was
as
much
as
the
whole
business
was
worth
you
bear
david
a
grudge
not
merely
because
you
have
plundered
him
but
because
also
your
own
son
is
a
man
far
above
yourself
you
profess
to
be
prodigiously
fond
of
your
grandson
to
cloak
your
want
of
feeling
for
your
son
and
his
wife
because
you
ought
to
pay
down
money
et
for
them
while
you
need
only
show
a
posthumous
affection
for
your
grandson
you
pretend
to
be
fond
of
the
little
fellow
lest
you
should
be
taxed
with
want
of
feeling
for
your
own
flesh
and
blood
that
is
the
bottom
of
it
papa
sechard
did
you
fetch
me
over
to
hear
this
asked
the
old
man
glowering
at
his
lawyer
his
and
his
son
in
turn
monsieur
protested
poor
eve
turning
to
have
you
vowed
to
ruin
us
my
husband
had
never
uttered
a
word
against
his
father
here
the
old
man
looked
cunningly
at
her
david
has
told
me
scores
of
times
that
you
loved
him
in
your
way
she
added
looking
at
her
and
understanding
his
suspicions
was
only
following
out
the
tall
cointet
instructions
he
was
widening
the
breach
between
the
father
and
son
lest
sechard
senior
should
extricate
david
from
his
intolerable
position
the
day
that
david
sechard
goes
to
prison
shall
be
the
day
of
your
introduction
to
mme
de
senonches
the
tall
cointet
had
said
no
longer
ago
than
yesterday
mme
sechard
with
the
quick
insight
of
love
had
divined
mercenary
hostility
even
as
she
had
once
before
felt
instinctively
that
cerizet
was
a
traitor
as
for
david
his
astonishment
may
be
imagined
he
could
not
understand
how
came
to
know
so
much
of
his
father
nature
and
his
own
history
upright
and
honorable
as
he
was
he
did
not
dream
of
the
relations
between
his
lawyer
and
the
cointets
nor
for
that
matter
did
he
know
that
the
cointets
were
at
work
behind
metivier
meanwhile
old
sechard
took
his
son
silence
as
an
insult
and
taking
advantage
of
his
client
bewilderment
beat
a
retreat
my
dear
david
you
have
had
warning
notice
of
appeal
does
invalidate
the
warrant
for
arrest
it
is
the
only
course
left
open
to
your
creditors
and
it
will
not
be
long
before
they
take
it
so
go
away
at
once
or
rather
if
you
will
take
my
advice
go
to
the
cointets
and
see
them
about
it
they
have
capital
if
your
invention
is
perfected
and
answers
the
purpose
go
into
partnership
with
them
after
all
they
are
very
good
fellows
your
invention
broke
in
old
sechard
why
do
you
suppose
that
your
son
is
fool
enough
to
let
his
business
slip
away
from
him
without
thinking
of
something
else
exclaimed
the
attorney
he
is
on
the
brink
of
the
discovery
of
a
way
of
making
paper
at
a
cost
of
three
francs
per
ream
instead
of
ten
he
tells
me
one
more
dodge
for
taking
me
in
you
are
all
as
thick
as
thieves
in
a
fair
if
david
has
found
out
such
a
plan
he
has
no
need
of
me
he
is
a
millionaire
my
dears
and
a
to
you
all
and
the
old
man
disappeared
down
the
staircase
find
some
way
of
hiding
yourself
was
parting
word
to
david
and
with
that
he
hurried
out
to
exasperate
old
sechard
still
further
he
found
the
vinegrower
growling
to
himself
outside
in
the
place
du
murier
went
with
him
as
far
as
and
there
left
him
with
a
threat
of
putting
in
an
execution
for
the
costs
due
to
him
unless
they
were
paid
before
the
week
was
out
i
will
pay
you
if
you
will
show
me
how
to
disinherit
my
son
without
injuring
my
or
the
boy
said
old
sechard
and
they
parted
forthwith
how
well
the
cointet
knows
the
folk
he
is
dealing
with
it
is
just
as
he
said
those
seven
hundred
francs
will
prevent
the
father
from
paying
seven
thousand
the
little
lawyer
thought
within
himself
as
he
climbed
the
path
to
angouleme
still
that
old
slyboots
of
a
must
not
overreach
us
it
is
time
to
ask
him
for
something
besides
promises
well
david
dear
what
do
you
mean
to
do
asked
eve
when
the
lawyer
had
followed
her
marion
put
your
biggest
pot
on
the
fire
called
david
i
have
my
secret
fast
at
this
eve
put
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
walking
shoes
with
feverish
haste
kolb
my
friend
get
ready
to
go
out
she
said
and
come
with
me
if
there
is
any
way
out
of
this
hell
i
must
find
it
when
eve
had
gone
out
marion
spoke
to
david
do
be
sensible
sir
she
said
or
the
mistress
will
fret
herself
to
death
make
some
money
to
pay
off
your
debts
and
then
you
can
try
to
find
treasure
at
your
ease
do
talk
marion
said
david
i
am
going
to
overcome
my
last
difficulty
and
then
i
can
apply
for
the
patent
and
the
improvement
on
the
patent
at
the
same
time
this
improvement
on
the
patent
is
the
curse
of
the
french
patentee
a
man
may
spend
ten
years
of
his
life
in
working
out
some
obscure
industrial
problem
and
when
he
has
invented
some
piece
of
machinery
or
made
a
discovery
of
some
kind
he
takes
out
a
patent
and
imagines
that
he
has
a
right
to
his
own
invention
then
there
comes
a
competitor
and
unless
the
first
inventor
has
foreseen
all
possible
contingencies
the
second
comer
makes
an
improvement
on
the
patent
with
a
screw
or
a
nut
and
takes
the
whole
thing
out
of
his
hands
the
discovery
of
a
cheap
material
for
paper
pulp
therefore
is
by
no
means
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
matter
david
sechard
was
anxiously
looking
ahead
on
all
sides
lest
the
fortune
sought
in
the
teeth
of
such
difficulties
should
be
snatched
out
of
his
hands
at
the
last
dutch
paper
as
flax
paper
is
still
called
though
it
is
no
longer
made
in
holland
is
slightly
sized
but
every
sheet
is
sized
separately
by
hand
and
this
increases
the
cost
of
production
if
it
were
possible
to
discover
some
way
of
sizing
the
paper
in
the
with
some
inexpensive
glue
like
that
in
use
though
even
now
it
is
not
quite
perfect
there
would
be
no
improvement
on
the
patent
to
fear
for
the
past
month
accordingly
david
had
been
making
experiments
in
sizing
pulp
he
had
two
discoveries
before
him
eve
went
to
see
her
mother
fortunately
it
so
happened
that
mme
chardon
was
nursing
the
wife
who
had
just
given
the
milauds
of
nevers
an
heir
presumptive
and
eve
in
her
distrust
of
all
attorneys
and
notaries
took
into
her
head
to
apply
for
advice
to
the
legal
guardian
of
widows
and
orphans
she
wanted
to
know
if
she
could
relieve
david
from
his
embarrassments
by
taking
them
upon
herself
and
selling
her
claims
upon
the
estate
and
besides
she
had
some
hope
of
discovering
the
truth
as
to
unaccountable
conduct
the
official
struck
with
mme
sechard
beauty
received
her
not
only
with
the
respect
due
to
a
woman
but
with
a
sort
of
courtesy
to
which
eve
was
not
accustomed
she
saw
in
the
magistrate
face
an
expression
which
since
her
marriage
she
had
seen
in
no
eyes
but
kolb
and
for
a
beautiful
woman
like
eve
this
expression
is
the
criterion
by
which
men
are
judged
when
passion
or
or
age
dims
that
spark
of
unquestioning
fealty
that
gleams
in
a
young
man
eyes
a
woman
feels
a
certain
mistrust
of
him
and
begins
to
observe
him
critically
the
cointets
cerizet
and
all
the
men
whom
eve
felt
instinctively
to
be
her
enemies
had
turned
hard
indifferent
eyes
on
her
with
the
therefore
she
felt
at
ease
although
in
spite
of
his
kindly
courtesy
he
swept
all
her
hopes
away
by
his
first
words
it
is
not
certain
madame
that
the
will
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
restricting
your
lien
on
your
property
for
payment
of
moneys
due
to
you
by
the
terms
of
your
to
household
goods
and
chattels
your
privilege
ought
not
to
be
used
to
defraud
the
other
creditors
but
in
any
case
you
will
be
allowed
to
take
your
share
of
the
proceeds
with
the
other
creditors
and
your
likewise
as
a
privileged
creditor
for
arrears
of
rent
when
the
court
has
given
the
order
other
points
may
be
raised
as
to
the
as
we
call
it
when
a
schedule
of
the
debts
is
drawn
up
and
the
creditors
are
paid
a
dividend
in
proportion
to
their
claims
then
is
bringing
us
to
bankruptcy
she
cried
is
carrying
out
your
husband
instructions
said
the
magistrate
he
is
anxious
to
gain
time
so
his
attorney
says
in
my
opinion
you
would
perhaps
do
better
to
waive
the
appeal
and
buy
in
at
the
sale
the
indispensable
implements
for
carrying
on
the
business
you
and
your
together
might
do
this
you
to
the
extent
of
your
claim
through
your
marriage
contract
and
he
for
his
arrears
of
rent
but
that
would
be
bringing
the
matter
to
an
end
too
soon
perhaps
the
lawyers
are
making
a
good
thing
out
of
your
case
but
then
i
should
be
entirely
in
sechard
father
hands
i
should
owe
him
the
hire
of
the
machinery
as
well
as
the
and
my
husband
would
still
be
open
to
further
proceedings
from
metivier
for
metivier
would
have
had
almost
nothing
that
is
true
madame
very
well
then
we
should
be
even
worse
off
than
we
are
the
arm
of
the
law
madame
is
at
the
creditor
disposal
you
have
received
three
thousand
francs
and
you
must
of
necessity
repay
the
money
oh
sir
can
you
think
that
we
are
capable
eve
suddenly
came
to
a
stop
she
saw
that
her
justification
might
injure
her
brother
oh
i
know
quite
well
that
it
is
an
obscure
affair
that
the
debtors
on
the
one
side
are
honest
scrupulous
and
even
behaving
handsomely
and
the
creditor
on
the
other
is
only
a
eve
aghast
looked
at
him
with
bewildered
eyes
you
can
understand
he
continued
with
a
look
full
of
homely
shrewdness
that
we
on
the
bench
have
plenty
of
time
to
think
over
all
that
goes
on
under
our
eyes
while
the
gentlemen
in
court
are
arguing
with
each
other
eve
went
home
in
despair
over
her
useless
effort
that
evening
at
seven
doublon
came
with
the
notification
of
imprisonment
for
debt
the
proceedings
had
reached
the
acute
stage
after
this
i
can
only
go
out
after
nightfall
said
david
eve
and
mme
chardon
burst
into
tears
to
be
in
hiding
was
for
them
a
shameful
thing
as
for
kolb
and
marion
they
were
more
alarmed
for
david
because
they
had
long
since
made
up
their
minds
that
there
was
no
guile
in
their
master
nature
so
frightened
were
they
on
his
account
that
they
came
upstairs
under
pretence
of
asking
whether
they
could
do
anything
and
found
eve
and
mme
chardon
in
tears
the
three
whose
life
had
been
so
straightforward
hitherto
were
overcome
by
the
thought
that
david
must
go
into
hiding
and
how
moreover
could
they
hope
to
escape
the
invisible
spies
who
henceforth
would
dog
every
least
movement
of
a
man
unluckily
so

oh
madame
do
let
him
go
begged
marion
he
is
only
thinking
of
saving
his
master
he
has
another
thought
in
his
head
kolb
is
not
an
alsacien
he
is
eh
well
a
regular
newfoundland
dog
for
rescuing
folk
go
my
good
kolb
said
david
we
have
still
time
to
do
something
kolb
hurried
off
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
bailiff
and
it
so
fell
out
that
david
enemies
were
in
doublon
office
holding
a
council
as
to
the
best
way
of
securing
him
the
arrest
of
a
debtor
is
an
thing
in
the
country
an
abnormal
proceeding
if
ever
there
was
one
everybody
in
the
first
place
knows
everybody
else
and
creditor
and
debtor
being
bound
to
meet
each
other
daily
all
their
lives
long
nobody
likes
to
take
this
odious
course
when
a
defaulter
to
use
the
provincial
term
for
a
debtor
for
they
do
not
mince
their
words
in
the
provinces
when
speaking
of
this
legalized
method
of
helping
yourself
to
another
goods
when
a
defaulter
plans
a
failure
on
a
large
scale
he
takes
sanctuary
in
paris
paris
is
a
kind
of
city
of
refuge
for
provincial
bankrupts
an
almost
impenetrable
retreat
the
writ
of
the
pursuing
bailiff
has
no
force
beyond
the
limits
of
his
jurisdiction
and
there
are
other
obstacles
rendering
it
almost
invalid
wherefore
the
paris
bailiff
is
empowered
to
enter
the
house
of
a
third
party
to
seize
the
person
of
the
debtor
while
for
the
bailiff
of
the
provinces
the
domicile
is
absolutely
inviolable
the
law
probably
makes
this
exception
as
to
paris
because
there
it
is
the
rule
for
two
or
more
families
to
live
under
the
same
roof
but
in
the
provinces
the
bailiff
who
wishes
to
make
forcible
entry
must
have
an
order
from
the
justice
of
the
peace
and
so
wide
a
discretion
is
allowed
the
justice
of
the
peace
that
he
is
practically
able
to
give
or
withhold
assistance
to
the
bailiffs
to
the
honor
of
the
justices
it
should
be
said
that
they
dislike
the
office
and
are
by
no
means
anxious
to
assist
blind
passions
or
revenge
there
are
besides
other
and
no
less
serious
difficulties
in
the
way
of
arrest
for
debt
difficulties
which
tend
to
temper
the
severity
of
legislation
and
public
opinion
not
infrequently
makes
a
dead
letter
of
the
law
in
great
cities
there
are
poor
or
degraded
wretches
enough
poverty
and
vice
know
no
scruples
and
consent
to
play
the
spy
but
in
a
little
country
town
people
know
each
other
too
well
to
earn
wages
of
the
bailiff
the
meanest
creature
who
should
lend
himself
to
dirty
work
of
this
kind
would
be
forced
to
leave
the
place
in
the
absence
of
recognized
machinery
therefore
the
arrest
of
a
debtor
is
a
problem
presenting
no
small
difficulty
it
becomes
a
kind
of
strife
of
ingenuity
between
the
bailiff
and
the
debtor
and
matter
for
many
pleasant
stories
in
the
newspapers
cointet
the
elder
did
not
choose
to
appear
in
the
affair
but
the
fat
cointet
openly
said
that
he
was
acting
for
metivier
and
went
to
doublon
taking
cerizet
with
him
cerizet
was
his
foreman
now
and
had
promised
his
in
return
for
a
note
doublon
could
reckon
upon
two
of
his
understrappers
and
thus
the
cointets
had
four
bloodhounds
already
on
the
victim
track
at
the
actual
time
of
arrest
doublon
could
furthermore
count
upon
the
police
force
who
are
bound
if
required
to
assist
a
bailiff
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
the
two
men
doublon
himself
and
the
visitors
were
all
closeted
together
in
the
private
office
beyond
the
public
office
on
the
ground
floor
a
tolerably
lobby
a
kind
of
led
to
the
public
office
the
gilded
scutcheons
of
the
court
with
the
word
bailiff
printed
thereon
in
large
black
letters
hung
outside
on
the
house
wall
on
either
side
the
door
both
office
windows
gave
upon
the
street
and
were
protected
by
heavy
iron
bars
but
the
private
office
looked
into
the
garden
at
the
back
wherein
doublon
an
adorer
of
pomona
grew
espaliers
with
marked
success
opposite
the
office
door
you
beheld
the
door
of
the
kitchen
and
beyond
the
kitchen
the
staircase
that
ascended
to
the
first
story
the
house
was
situated
in
a
narrow
street
at
the
back
of
the
new
law
courts
then
in
process
of
construction
and
only
finished
after
these
details
are
necessary
if
adventures
are
to
be
intelligible
to
the
reader
it
was
kolb
idea
to
go
to
the
bailiff
to
pretend
to
be
willing
to
betray
his
master
and
in
this
way
to
discover
the
traps
which
would
be
laid
for
david
kolb
told
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
that
he
wanted
to
speak
to
doublon
on
business
the
servant
was
busy
washing
up
her
plates
and
dishes
and
not
very
well
pleased
at
interruption
she
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
outer
office
and
bade
him
wait
there
till
her
master
was
at
liberty
then
as
he
was
a
stranger
to
her
she
told
the
master
in
the
private
office
that
a
man
wanted
to
speak
to
him
now
a
man
so
invariably
means
a
peasant
that
doublon
said
tell
him
to
wait
and
kolb
took
a
seat
close
to
the
door
of
the
private
office
there
were
voices
talking
within
ah
by
the
by
how
do
you
mean
to
set
about
it
for
if
we
can
catch
him
it
will
be
so
much
time
saved
it
was
the
fat
cointet
who
spoke
nothing
easier
the
gaffer
has
come
fairly
by
his
nickname
said
cerizet
at
the
sound
of
the
fat
cointet
voice
kolb
guessed
at
once
that
they
were
talking
about
his
master
especially
as
the
sense
of
the
words
began
to
dawn
upon
him
but
when
he
recognized
cerizet
tones
his
astonishment
grew
more
and
more
und
dat
fellow
haf
eaten
his
pread
he
thought
we
must
do
it
in
this
way
boys
said
doublon
we
will
post
our
men
at
good
long
intervals
about
the
rue
de
beaulieu
and
the
place
du
murier
in
every
direction
so
that
we
can
follow
the
gaffer
i
like
that
word
without
his
knowledge
we
will
not
lose
sight
of
him
until
he
is
safe
inside
the
house
where
he
means
to
lie
in
hiding
as
he
thinks
there
we
will
leave
him
in
peace
for
awhile
then
some
fine
day
we
will
come
across
him
before
sunrise
or
sunset
but
what
is
he
doing
now
at
this
moment
he
may
be
slipping
through
our
fingers
said
the
fat
cointet
he
is
in
his
house
answered
doublon
if
he
left
it
i
should
know
i
have
one
witness
posted
in
the
place
du
murier
another
at
the
corner
of
the
law
courts
and
another
thirty
paces
from
the
house
if
our
man
came
out
they
would
whistle
he
could
not
make
three
paces
from
his
door
but
i
should
know
of
it
at
once
from
the
signal
bailiffs
speak
of
their
understrappers
by
the
polite
title
of
witnesses
here
was
better
hap
than
kolb
had
expected
he
went
noiselessly
out
of
the
office
and
spoke
to
the

hurried
off
to

out

and
rushed
back
to

when

whole
history
of

of
the
circle
traced
about
the
house
and
of
the
fat

in
the

and
given
the

some
inkling
of
the
schemes
set
on

by

said
at

recovering
some
presence
of
mind
how

no
sooner
did
david
and
kolb
come
out
of
the
house
than
they
heard
a
sharp
whistle
and
were
followed
to
the
livery
stable

there

an

the
old
cavalry
man
clapped
both
spurs
to
his
horse
and
was
out
into
the
country
and
the
darkness
not
merely
before
the
spies
could
follow
but
before
they
had
time
to
discover
the
direction
that
he
took
eve
meanwhile
went
out
on
the
tolerably
ingenious
pretext
of
asking
advise
of
postel
sat
awhile
enduring
the
insulting
pity
that
spends
itself
in
words
left
the
postel
family
and
stole
away
unseen
to
basine
clerget
told
her
troubles
and
asked
for
help
and
shelter
basine
for
greater
safety
had
brought
eve
into
her
bedroom
and
now
she
opened
the
door
of
a
little
closet
lighted
only
by
a
skylight
in
such
a
way
that
prying
eyes
could
not
see
into
it
the
two
friends
unstopped
the
flue
which
opened
into
the
chimney
of
the
stove
in
the
workroom
where
the
girls
heated
their
irons
eve
and
basine
spread
ragged
coverlets
over
the
brick
floor
to
deaden
any
sound
that
david
might
make
put
in
a
truckle
bed
a
stove
for
his
experiments
and
a
table
and
a
chair
basine
promised
to
bring
food
in
the
night
and
as
no
one
had
occasion
to
enter
her
room
david
might
defy
his
enemies
one
and
all
or
even
detectives
at
last
eve
said
with
her
arms
about
her
friend
at
last
he
is
in
safety
eve
went
back
to
postel
to
submit
a
fresh
doubt
that
had
occurred
to
her
she
said
she
would
like
the
opinion
of
such
an
experienced
member
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
she
so
managed
that
he
escorted
her
home
and
listened
patiently
to
his
commiseration
would
this
have
happened
if
you
had
married
me
all
the
little
druggist
remarks
were
pitched
in
this
key
then
he
went
home
again
to
find
mme
postel
jealous
of
mme
sechard
and
furious
with
her
spouse
for
his
polite
attention
to
that
beautiful
woman
the
apothecary
advanced
the
opinion
that
little
women
were
preferable
to
tall
dark
women
who
like
fine
horses
were
always
in
the
stable
he
said
he
gave
proofs
of
his
sincerity
no
doubt
for
mme
postel
was
very
sweet
to
him
next
day
we
may
be
easy
eve
said
to
her
mother
and
marion
whom
she
found

in
a
taking
in
the
latter
phrase
oh

said
marion
when

looked
unthinkingly
round
the
room

league
out
of
angouleme
on
the
main
road

kolb

said
david
since
we
are
on
the
way
already
i
will
try
once
more
to
soften
my
father
heart
i
would

said
kolb
your
resbected
fader
haf
no
heart
whatefer
the
had
no
belief
in
his
son
he
judged
him
from
the
outside
point
of
view
and
waited
for
results
he
had
no
idea
to
begin
with
that
he
had
plundered
david
nor
did
he
make
allowance
for
the
very
different
circumstances
under
which
they
had
begun
life
he
said
to
himself
i
set
him
up
with
a
just
as
i
found
it
myself
and
he
knowing
a
thousand
times
more
than
i
did
can
not
keep
it
going
he
was
mentally
incapable
of
understanding
his
son
he
laid
the
blame
of
failure
upon
him
and
even
prided
himself
as
it
were
on
his
superiority
to
a
far
greater
intellect
than
his
own
with
the
thought
i
am
securing
his
bread
for
him
moralists
will
never
succeed
in
making
us
comprehend
the
full
extent
of
the
influence
of
sentiment
upon
an
influence
every
whit
as
strong
as
the
action
of
interest
upon
our
sentiments
for
every
law
of
our
nature
works
in
two
ways
and
acts
and
reacts
upon
us
david
on
his
side
understood
his
father
and
in
his
sublime
charity
forgave
him
kolb
and
david
reached
marsac
at
eight
and
suddenly
came
in
upon
the
old
man
as
he
was
finishing
his
dinner
which
by
force
of
circumstances
came
very
near
bedtime
i
see
you
because
there
is
no
help
for
it
said
old
sechard
with
a
sour
smile
und
how
should
you

he

in

so
as
to

here
fathers
are
always
in
the
right
remember
that
kolb
went
off
growling
like
a
chidden
dog
obedient
but
protesting
and
david
proposed
to
give
his
father
indisputable
proof
of
his
discovery
while
reserving
his
secret
he
offered
to
give
him
an
interest
in
the
affair
in
return
for
money
paid
down
a
sufficient
sum
to
release
him
from
his
present
difficulties
with
or
without
a
further
amount
of
capital
to
be
employed
in
developing
the
invention
and
how
are
you
going
to
prove
to
me
that
you
can
make
good
paper
that
costs
nothing
out
of
nothing
eh
asked
the
giving
his
son
a
glance
vinous
it
may
be
but
keen
inquisitive
and
covetous
a
look
like
a
flash
of
lightning
from
a
sodden
cloud
for
the
old
bear
faithful
to
his
traditions
never
went
to
bed
without
a
nightcap
consisting
of
a
couple
of
bottles
of
excellent
old
wine
which
he
tippled
down
of
an
evening
to
use
his
own
expression
nothing
simpler
said
david
i
have
none
of
the
paper
about
me
for
i
came
here
to
be
out
of
doublon
way
and
having
come
so
far
i
thought
i
might
as
well
come
to
you
at
marsac
as
borrow
of
a
i
have
nothing
on
me
but
my
clothes
shut
me
up
somewhere
on
the
premises
so
that
nobody
can
come
in
and
see
me
at
work
and
what
you
will
not
let
me
see
you
at
your
work
then
asked
the
old
man
with
an
ugly
look
at
his
son
you
have
given
me
to
understand
plainly
father
that
in
matters
of
business
there
is
no
question
of
father
and
son
ah
you
distrust
the
father
that
gave
you
life
no
the
other
father
who
took
away
the
means
of
earning
a
livelihood
each
for
himself
you
are
right
said
the
old
man
very
good
i
will
put
you
in
the
cellar
i
will
go
down
there
with
kolb
you
must
let
me
have
a
large
pot
for
my
pulp
said
david
then
he
continued
without
noticing
the
quick
look
his
father
gave
him
and
you
must
find
artichoke
and
asparagus
stalks
for
me
and
nettles
and
the
reeds
that
you
cut
by
the
stream
side
and
morning
i
will
come
out
of
your
cellar
with
some
splendid
paper
if
you
can
do
that
hiccoughed
the
bear
i
will
let
you
have
perhaps
i
will
see
that
is
if
i
can
let
you
have
pshaw
thousand
francs
on
condition
mind
that
you
make
as
much
for
me
every
year
put
me
to
the
proof
i
am
quite
willing
cried
david
kolb
take
the
horse
and
go
to
mansle
quick
buy
a
large
hair
sieve
for
me
of
a
cooper
and
some
glue
of
the
grocer
and
come
back
again
as
soon
as
you
can
there
drink
said
old
sechard
putting
down
a
bottle
of
wine
a
loaf
and
the
cold
remains
of
the
dinner
you
will
need
your
strength
i
will
go
and
look
for
your
bits
of
green
stuff
green
rags
you
use
for
your
pulp
and
a
trifle
too
green
i
am
afraid
two
hours
later
towards
eleven
that
night
david
and
kolb
took
up
their
quarters
in
a
little
against
the
cellar
wall
they
found
the
floor
paved
with
runnel
tiles
and
all
the
apparatus
used
in
angoumois
for
the
manufacture
of
cognac
brandy
pans
and
firewood
why
it
is
as
good
as
a
factory
made
on
purpose
cried
david
very
well
said
old
sechard
i
shall
lock
you
in
and
let
both
the
dogs
loose
nobody
will
bring
you
any
paper
i
am
sure
you
show
me
those
sheets
and
i
give
you
my
word
i
will
be
your
partner
and
the
business
will
be
straightforward
and
properly
managed
david
and
kolb
locked
into
the
distillery
spent
nearly
two
hours
in
macerating
the
stems
using
a
couple
of
logs
for
mallets
the
fire
blazed
up
the
water
boiled
about
two
in
the
morning
kolb
heard
a
sound
which
david
was
too
busy
to
notice
a
kind
of
deep
breath
like
a
suppressed
hiccough
snatching
up
one
of
the
two
lighted
dips
he
looked
round
the
walls
and
beheld
old
sechard
empurpled
countenance
filling
up
a
square
opening
above
a
door
hitherto
hidden
by
a
pile
of
empty
casks
in
the
cellar
itself
the
cunning
old
man
had
brought
david
and
kolb
into
his
underground
distillery
by
the
outer
door
through
which
the
casks
were
rolled
when
full
the
inner
door
had
been
made
so
that
he
could
roll
his
puncheons
straight
from
the
cellar
into
the
distillery
instead
of
taking
them
round
through
the
yard
aha

eies

cried
david
i

to

sobered
by
this
time
und
it
was

commented
kolb
as
he
pushed
the
casks
aside
and
flung
open
the
door
and
there
in
fact
on
a
short
the
old
man
stood
in
his
shirt
risking
your
health
said
david
i
think
i
must
be
walking
in
my
sleep
said
old
sechard
coming
down
in
confusion
your
want
of
confidence
in
your
father
set
me
dreaming
i
dreamed
you
were
making
a
pact
with
the
devil
to
do
impossible
things
der

said
kolb

said
david
lock

in
if
you
will
but
you
may
save
yourself
the
trouble
of
coming
down
again
kolb
will
mount
guard
at
four
in
the
morning
david
came
out
of
the
distillery
he
had
been
careful
to
leave
no
sign
of
his
occupation
behind
him
but
he
brought
out
some
thirty
sheets
of
paper
that
left
nothing
to
be
desired
in
fineness
whiteness
toughness
and
strength
all
of
them
bearing
by
way
of
the
impress
of
the
uneven
hairs
of
the
sieve
the
old
man
took
up
the
samples
and
put
his
tongue
to
them
the
lifelong
habit
of
the
pressman
who
tests
papers
in
this
way
he
felt
it
between
his
thumb
and
finger
crumpled
and
creased
it
put
it
through
all
the
trials
by
which
a
printer
assays
the
quality
of
a
sample
submitted
to
him
and
when
it
was
found
wanting
in
no
respect
he
still
would
not
allow
that
he
was
beaten
we
have
yet
to
know
how
it
takes
an
impression
he
said
to
avoid
praising
his
son
funny
man
exclaimed
kolb
the
old
man
was
cool
enough
now
he
cloaked
his
feigned
hesitation
with
paternal
dignity
i
wish
to
tell
you
in
fairness
father
that
even
now
it
seems
to
me
that
paper
costs
more
than
it
ought
to
do
i
want
to
solve
the
problem
of
sizing
it
in
the
i
have
just
that
one
improvement
to
make
oho
so
you
are
trying
to
trick
me
well
shall
i
tell
you
i
can
size
the
pulp
as
it
is
but
so
far
i
can
not
do
it
evenly
and
the
surface
is
as
rough
as
a
burr
very
good
size
your
pulp
in
the
trough
and
you
shall
have
my
money
mein
master
will
nefer
see
de
golor
of
your
money
declared
kolb
father
he
began
i
have
never
borne
you
any
grudge
for
making
over
the
business
to
me
at
such
an
exorbitant
valuation
i
have
seen
the
father
through
it
all
i
have
said
to
myself
old
man
has
worked
very
hard
and
he
certainly
gave
me
a
better
bringing
up
than
i
had
a
right
to
expect
let
him
enjoy
the
fruits
of
his
toil
in
peace
and
in
his
own
i
even
gave
up
my
mother
money
to
you
i
began
encumbered
with
debt
and
bore
all
the
burdens
that
you
put
upon
me
without
a
murmur
well
harassed
for
debts
that
were
not
of
my
making
with
no
bread
in
the
house
and
my
feet
held
to
the
flames
i
have
found
out
the
secret
i
have
struggled
on
patiently
till
my
strength
is
exhausted
it
is
perhaps
your
duty
to
help
me
but
do
not
give
a
thought
think
of
a
woman
and
a
little
one
david
could
not
keep
back
the
tears
at
this
think
of
them
and
give
them
help
and
kolb
and
marion
have
given
me
their
savings
will
you
do
less
he
cried
at
last
seeing
that
his
father
was
as
cold
as
the
and
that
was
not
enough
for
you
said
the
old
man
without
the
slightest
sense
of
shame
why
you
would
waste
the
wealth
of
the
indies
i
am
too
ignorant
to
lend
a
hand
in
schemes
got
up
on
purpose
to
exploit
me
a
monkey
will
never
gobble
down
a
bear
alluding
to
the
workshop
nicknames
i
am
a
vinegrower
i
am
not
a
banker
and
what
is
more
look
you
business
between
father
and
son
never
turns
out
well
stay
and
eat
your
dinner
here
you
sha
say
that
you
came
for
nothing
there
are
some
natures
that
can
force
their
own
pain
down
into
inner
depths
unsuspected
by
those
dearest
to
them
and
with
them
when
anguish
forces
its
way
to
the
surface
and
is
visible
it
is
only
after
a
mighty
upheaval
david
nature
was
one
of
these
eve
had
thoroughly
understood
the
noble
character
of
the
man
but
now
that
the
depths
had
been
stirred
david
father
took
the
wave
of
anguish
that
passed
over
his
son
features
for
a
child
trick
an
attempt
to
get
round
his
father
and
his
bitter
grief
for
mortification
over
the
failure
of
the
attempt
father
and
son
parted
in
anger
david
and
kolb
reached
angouleme
on
the
stroke
of
midnight
they
came
back
on
foot
and
steathily
like
burglars
before
one
in
the
morning
david
was
installed
in
the
impenetrable
prepared
by
his
wife
in
basine
clerget
house
no
one
saw
him
enter
it
and
the
pity
that
henceforth
should
shelter
david
was
the
most
resourceful
pity
of
all
the
pity
of
a
kolb
bragged
that
day
that
he
had
saved
his
master
on
horseback
and
only
left
him
in
a
carrier
van
well
on
the
way
to
limoges
a
sufficient
provision
of
raw
material
had
been
laid
up
in
cellar
and
kolb
marion
mme
sechard
and
her
mother
had
no
communication
with
the
house
two
days
after
the
scene
at
marsac
old
sechard
came
hurrying
to
angouleme
and
his
covetousness
had
brought
him
there
were
three
clear
weeks
ahead
before
the
vintage
began
and
he
thought
he
would
be
on
the
for
squalls
to
use
his
own
expression
to
this
end
he
took
up
his
quarters
in
one
of
the
attics
which
he
had
reserved
by
the
terms
of
the
lease
wilfully
shutting
his
eyes
to
the
bareness
and
want
that
made
his
son
home
desolate
if
they
owed
him
rent
they
could
well
afford
to
keep
him
he
ate
his
food
from
a
tinned
iron
plate
and
made
no
marvel
at
it
i
began
in
the
same
way
he
told
his
when
she
apologized
for
the
absence
of
silver
spoons
marion
was
obliged
to
run
into
debt
for
necessaries
for
them
all
kolb
was
earning
a
franc
for
daily
wage
as
a
laborer
and
at
last
poor
eve
who
for
the
sake
of
her
husband
and
child
had
sacrificed
her
last
resources
to
entertain
david
father
saw
that
she
had
only
ten
francs
left
she
had
hoped
to
the
last
to
soften
the
old
miser
heart
by
her
affectionate
respect
and
patience
and
pretty
attentions
but
old
sechard
was
obdurate
as
ever
when
she
saw
him
turn
the
same
cold
eyes
on
her
the
same
look
that
the
cointets
had
given
her
and
and
cerizet
she
tried
to
watch
and
guess
old
sechard
intentions
trouble
thrown
away
old
sechard
never
sober
never
drunk
was
inscrutable
intoxication
is
a
double
veil
if
the
old
man
tipsiness
was
sometimes
real
it
was
quite
often
feigned
for
the
purpose
of
extracting
david
secret
from
his
wife
sometimes
he
coaxed
sometimes
he
frightened
his
i
will
drink
up
my
property
will
buy
an
he
would
threaten
when
eve
told
him
that
she
knew
nothing
the
humiliating
struggle
was
wearing
her
out
she
kept
silence
at
last
lest
she
should
show
disrespect
to
her
husband
father
but
father
she
said
one
day
when
driven
to
extremity
there
is
a
very
simple
way
of
finding
out
everything
pay
david
debts
he
will
come
home
and
you
can
settle
it
between
you
ha
that
is
what
you
want
to
get
out
of
me
is
it
he
cried
it
is
as
well
to
know
but
if
sechard
had
no
belief
in
his
son
he
had
plenty
of
faith
in
the
cointets
he
went
to
consult
them
and
the
cointets
dazzled
him
of
set
purpose
telling
him
that
his
son
experiments
might
mean
millions
of
francs
if
david
can
prove
that
he
has
succeeded
i
shall
not
hesitate
to
go
into
partnership
with
him
and
reckon
his
discovery
as
half
the
capital
the
tall
cointet
told
him
the
suspicious
old
man
learned
a
good
deal
over
nips
of
brandy
with
the
and
something
more
by
questioning
and
feigning
stupidity
and
at
length
he
felt
convinced
that
the
cointets
were
the
real
movers
behind
metivier
they
were
plotting
to
ruin
sechard
printing
establishment
and
to
lure
him
sechard
on
to
pay
his
son
debts
by
holding
out
the
discovery
as
a
bait
the
old
man
of
the
people
did
not
suspect
that
was
in
the
plot
nor
had
he
any
idea
of
the
toils
woven
to
ensnare
the
great
secret
a
day
came
at
last
when
he
grew
angry
and
out
of
patience
with
the
who
would
not
so
much
as
tell
him
where
david
was
hiding
he
determined
to
force
the
laboratory
door
for
he
had
discovered
that
david
was
wont
to
make
his
experiments
in
the
workshop
where
the
rollers
were
melted
down
he
came
downstairs
very
early
one
morning
and
set
to
work
upon
the
lock
hey
papa
sechard
what
are
you
doing
there
marion
called
out
she
had
risen
at
daybreak
to
go
to
her
papermill
and
now
she
sprang
across
to
the
workshop
i
am
in
my
own
house
am
i
not
said
the
old
man
in
some
confusion
oh
indeed
are
you
turning
thief
in
your
old
age
you
are
not
drunk
this
time
either
i
shall
go
straight
to
the
mistress
and
tell
her
hold
your
tongue
marion
said
sechard
drawing
two
crowns
of
six
francs
each
from
his
pocket
there
i
will
hold
my
tongue
but
do
you
do
it
again
said
marion
shaking
her
finger
at
him
or
all
angouleme
shall
hear
of
it
the
old
man
had
scarcely
gone
out
however
when
marion
went
up
to
her
mistress
look
madame
she
said
i
have
had
twelve
francs
out
of
your
and
here
they
are
how
did
you
do
it
what
was
he
wanting
to
do
but
to
take
a
look
at
the
master
pots
and
pans
and
stuff
to
find
out
the
secret
forsooth
i
knew
quite
well
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
little
place
but
i
frightened
him
and
talked
as
if
he
were
setting
about
robbing
his
son
and
he
gave
me
twelve
francs
to
say
nothing
about
it
just
at
that
moment
basine
came
in
radiant
and
with
a
letter
for
her
friend
a
letter
from
david
written
on
magnificent
paper
which
she
handed
over
when
they
were
alone
my
adored
eve
i
am
writing
to
you
the
first
letter
on
my
first
sheet
of
paper
made
by
the
new
process
i
have
solved
the
problem
of
sizing
the
pulp
in
the
trough
at
last
a
pound
of
pulp
costs
five
sous
even
supposing
that
the
raw
material
is
grown
on
good
soil
with
special
culture
three
francs
worth
of
sized
pulp
will
make
a
ream
of
paper
at
twelve
pounds
to
the
ream
i
am
quite
sure
that
i
can
lessen
the
weight
of
books
by
the
envelope
the
letter
and
samples
enclosed
are
all
manufactured
in
different
ways
i
kiss
you
you
shall
have
wealth
now
to
add
to
our
happiness
everything
else
we
had
before
there
said
eve
handing
the
samples
to
her
when
the
vintage
is
over
let
your
son
have
the
money
give
him
a
chance
to
make
his
fortune
and
you
shall
be
repaid
ten
times
over
he
has
succeeded
at
last
old
sechard
hurried
at
once
to
the
cointets
every
sample
was
tested
and
minutely
examined
the
prices
from
three
to
ten
francs
per
ream
were
noted
on
each
separate
slip
some
were
sized
others
unsized
some
were
of
almost
metallic
purity
others
soft
as
japanese
paper
in
color
there
was
every
possible
shade
of
white
if
old
sechard
and
the
two
cointets
had
been
jews
examining
diamonds
their
eyes
could
not
have
glistened
more
eagerly
your
son
is
on
the
right
track
the
fat
cointet
said
at
length
very
well
pay
his
debts
returned
old
sechard
by
all
means
if
he
will
take
us
into
partnership
said
the
tall
cointet
you
are
extortioners
cried
old
sechard
you
have
been
suing
him
under
metivier
name
and
you
mean
me
to
buy
you
off
that
is
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
not
such
a
fool
gentlemen
the
brothers
looked
at
one
another
but
they
contrived
to
hide
their
surprise
at
the
old
miser
shrewdness
we
are
not
millionaires
said
fat
cointet
we
do
not
discount
bills
for
amusement
we
should
think
ourselves
well
off
if
we
could
pay
ready
money
for
our
bits
of
accounts
for
rags
and
we
still
give
bills
to
our
dealer
the
experiment
ought
to
be
tried
first
on
a
much
larger
scale
the
tall
cointet
said
coldly
sometimes
you
try
a
thing
with
a
saucepan
and
succeed
and
fail
utterly
when
you
experiment
with
bulk
you
should
help
your
son
out
of
difficulties
yes
but
when
my
son
is
at
liberty
would
he
take
me
as
his
partner
that
is
no
business
of
ours
said
the
fat
cointet
my
good
man
do
you
suppose
that
when
you
have
paid
some
ten
thousand
francs
for
your
son
that
there
is
an
end
of
it
it
will
cost
two
thousand
francs
to
take
out
a
patent
there
will
be
journeys
to
paris
and
before
going
to
any
expense
it
would
be
prudent
to
do
as
my
brother
suggests
and
make
a
thousand
reams
or
so
to
try
several
whole
batches
to
make
sure
you
see
there
is
nothing
you
must
be
so
much
on
your
guard
against
as
an
inventor
i
have
a
liking
for
bread
ready
buttered
myself
added
the
tall
cointet
all
through
that
night
the
old
man
ruminated
over
this
dilemma
if
i
pay
david
debts
he
will
be
set
at
liberty
and
once
set
at
liberty
he
need
not
share
his
fortune
with
me
unless
he
chooses
he
knows
very
well
that
i
cheated
him
over
the
first
partnership
and
he
will
not
care
to
try
a
second
so
it
is
to
my
interest
to
keep
him
shut
up
the
wretched
boy
the
cointets
knew
enough
of
sechard
senior
to
see
that
they
should
hunt
in
couples
all
three
said
to
themselves
experiments
must
be
tried
before
the
discovery
can
take
any
practical
shape
david
sechard
must
be
set
at
liberty
before
those
experiments
can
be
made
and
david
sechard
set
at
liberty
will
slip
through
our
fingers
everybody
involved
moreover
had
his
own
little
afterthought
for
instance
said
as
soon
as
i
am
married
i
will
slip
my
neck
out
of
the
cointets
yoke
but
till
then
i
shall
hold
on
the
tall
cointet
thought
i
would
rather
have
david
under
lock
and
key
and
then
i
should
be
master
of
the
situation
old
sechard
too
thought
if
i
pay
my
son
debts
he
will
repay
me
with
a
you
eve
hard
pressed
for
the
old
man
threatened
now
to
turn
her
out
of
the
house
would
neither
reveal
her
husband
nor
even
send
proposals
of
a
she
could
not
feel
sure
of
finding
so
safe
a
refuge
a
second
time
set
your
son
at
liberty
she
told
her
and
then
you
shall
know
everything
the
four
interested
persons
sat
as
it
were
with
a
banquet
spread
before
them
none
of
them
daring
to
begin
each
one
suspicious
and
watchful
of
his
neighbor
a
few
days
after
david
went
into
hiding
went
to
the
mill
to
see
the
tall
cointet
i
have
done
my
best
he
said
david
has
gone
into
prison
of
his
own
accord
somewhere
or
other
he
is
working
out
some
improvement
there
in
peace
it
is
no
fault
of
mine
if
you
have
not
gained
your
end
are
you
going
to
keep
your
promise
yes
if
we
succeed
said
the
tall
cointet
old
sechard
was
here
only
a
day
or
two
ago
he
came
to
ask
us
some
questions
as
to
the
old
miser
has
got
wind
of
his
son
invention
he
wants
to
turn
it
to
his
own
account
so
there
is
some
hope
of
a
partnership
you
are
with
the
father
and
the
son
be
the
third
person
in
the
trinity
and
give
them
up
smiled
yes
said
cointet
when
you
have
david
in
prison
or
bound
to
us
by
a
deed
of
partnership
you
shall
marry
mlle
de
la
haye
is
that
your
my
qua
said
cointet
since
we
are
speaking
in
foreign
languages
then
here
is
mine
in
plain
language
said
drily
ah
let
us
have
it
answered
cointet
with
some
curiosity
you
will
present
me
to
mme
de
sononches
and
do
something
definite
for
me
you
will
keep
your
word
in
short
or
i
will
clear
off
sechard
debts
myself
sell
my
practice
and
go
into
partnership
with
him
i
will
not
be
duped
you
have
spoken
out
and
i
am
doing
the
same
i
have
given
proof
give
me
proof
of
your
sincerity
you
have
all
and
i
have
nothing
if
you
wo
do
fairly
by
me
i
know
your
cards
and
i
shall
play
for
my
own
hand
the
tall
cointet
took
his
hat
and
umbrella
his
face
at
the
same
time
taking
its
jesuitical
expression
and
out
he
went
bidding
come
with
him
you
shall
see
my
friend
whether
i
have
prepared
your
way
for
you
said
he
the
shrewd
saw
his
danger
at
a
glance
and
saw
too
that
with
a
man
like
it
was
better
to
play
above
board
partly
to
be
prepared
for
contingencies
partly
to
satisfy
his
conscience
he
had
dropped
a
word
or
two
to
the
point
in
the
ear
of
the
under
the
pretext
of
putting
mlle
de
la
financial
position
before
that
gentleman
i
have
the
man
for
francoise
he
had
said
for
with
thirty
thousand
francs
of
a
girl
must
not
expect
too
much
nowadays
we
will
talk
it
over
later
on
answered
francis
du
hautoy
mme
de
senonches
positon
has
altered
very
much
since
mme
de
bargeton
went
away
we
very
likely
might
marry
francoise
to
some
elderly
country
gentleman
she
would
disgrace
herself
if
you
did
cointet
returned
in
his
dry
way
better
marry
her
to
some
capable
ambitious
young
man
you
could
help
him
with
your
influence
and
he
would
make
a
good
position
for
his
wife
we
shall
see
said
francis
du
hautoy
her
godmother
ought
to
be
consulted
first
in
any
case
when
de
bargeton
died
his
wife
sold
the
great
house
in
the
rue
du
minage
mme
de
senonches
finding
her
own
house
scarcely
large
enough
persuaded
de
senonches
to
buy
the
hotel
de
bargeton
the
cradle
of
lucien
chardon
ambitions
the
scene
of
the
earliest
events
in
his
career
zephirine
de
senonches
had
it
in
mind
to
succeed
to
mme
de
bargeton
she
too
would
be
a
kind
of
queen
in
angouleme
she
would
have
a
salon
and
be
a
great
lady
in
short
there
was
a
schism
in
angouleme
a
strife
dating
from
the
late
de
duel
with
de
chandour
some
maintained
that
louise
de
negrepelisse
was
blameless
others
believed
in
stanislas
de
chandour
scandals
mme
de
senonches
declared
for
the
bargetons
and
began
by
winning
over
that
faction
many
frequenters
of
the
hotel
de
bargeton
had
been
so
accustomed
for
years
to
their
nightly
game
of
cards
in
the
house
that
they
could
not
leave
it
and
mme
de
senonches
turned
this
fact
to
account
she
received
every
evening
and
certainly
gained
all
the
ground
lost
by
amelie
de
chandour
who
set
up
for
a
rival
francis
du
hautoy
living
in
the
inmost
circle
of
nobility
in
angouleme
went
so
far
as
to
think
of
marrying
francoise
to
old
de
severac
mme
du
brossard
having
totally
failed
to
capture
that
gentleman
for
her
daughter
and
when
mme
de
bargeton
reappeared
as
the
prefect
wife
zephirine
hopes
for
her
dear
goddaughter
waxed
high
indeed
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
so
she
argued
would
be
sure
to
use
her
influence
for
her
champion
boniface
cointet
had
angouleme
at
his
fingers
ends
he
saw
all
the
difficulties
at
a
glance
and
resolved
to
sweep
them
out
of
the
way
by
a
bold
stroke
that
only
a
tartuffe
brain
could
invent
the
puny
lawyer
was
not
a
little
amused
to
find
his
keeping
his
word
with
him
not
a
word
did
utter
he
respected
the
musings
of
his
companion
and
they
walked
the
whole
way
from
the
to
the
rue
du
minage
in
silence
monsieur
and
madame
are
at
breakfast
this
announcement
met
the
visitors
on
the
steps
take
in
our
names
all
the
same
said
the
tall
cointet
and
feeling
sure
of
his
position
he
followed
immediately
behind
the
servant
and
introduced
his
companion
to
the
zephirine
who
was
breakfasting
in
company
with
francis
du
hautoy
and
mlle
de
la
haye

gone
as
usual
for
a
day

the
young
lawyer
of
whom
i
spoke
to
you
madame
he
will
go
through
the
trust
accounts
when
your
fair
ward
comes
of
age
the
made
a
quick
scrutiny
of
who
for
his
part
was
looking
furtively
at
the
fair
ward
as
for
zephirine
who
heard
of
the
matter
for
the
first
time
her
surprise
was
so
great
that
she
dropped
her
fork
mlle
de
la
haye
a
shrewish
young
woman
with
an
face
a
waist
that
could
scarcely
be
called
slender
a
thin
figure
and
colorless
fair
hair
in
spite
of
a
certain
little
air
that
she
had
was
by
no
means
easy
to
marry
the
parentage
unknown
on
her
birth
certificate
was
the
real
bar
to
her
entrance
into
the
sphere
where
her
godmother
affection
stove
to
establish
her
mlle
de
la
haye
ignorant
of
her
real
position
was
very
hard
to
please
the
richest
merchant
in
had
found
no
favor
in
her
sight
cointet
saw
the
sufficiently
significant
expression
of
the
young
lady
face
at
the
sight
of
the
little
lawyer
and
turning
beheld
a
precisely
similar
grimace
on
countenance
mme
de
senonches
and
francis
looked
at
each
other
as
if
in
search
of
an
excuse
for
getting
rid
of
the
visitors
all
this
cointet
saw
he
asked
du
hautoy
for
the
favor
of
a
few
minutes
speech
with
him
and
the
pair
went
together
into
the
fatherly
affection
is
blinding
you
sir
he
said
bluntly
you
will
not
find
it
an
easy
thing
to
marry
your
daughter
and
acting
in
your
interest
throughout
i
have
put
you
in
a
position
from
which
you
can
not
draw
back
for
i
am
fond
of
francoise
she
is
my
ward
now
knows
his
overweening
ambition
is
a
guarantee
for
our
dear
child
happiness
for
in
the
first
place
francoise
will
do
as
she
likes
with
her
husband
and
in
the
second
he
wants
your
influence
you
can
ask
the
new
prefect
for
the
post
of
crown
attorney
for
him
in
the
court
here
milaud
is
definitely
appointed
to
nevers
will
sell
his
practice
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
a
deputy
public
prosecutor
place
for
him
and
it
will
not
be
long
before
he
becomes
attorney
for
the
crown
president
of

court
deputy
what
you
will
francis
went
back
to
the
and
behaved
charmingly
to
his
daughter
suitor
he
gave
mme
de
senonches
a
look
and
brought
the
scene
to
a
close
with
an
invitation
to
dine
with
them
on
the
morrow
must
come
and
discuss
the
business
in
hand
he
even
went
downstairs
and
as
far
as
the
corner
with
the
visitors
telling
that
after
cointet
recommendation
both
he
and
mme
de
senonches
were
disposed
to
approve
all
that
mlle
de

haye
trustee
had
arranged
for
the
welfare
of
that
little
angel
oh
cried
as
they
came
away
what
a
plain
girl
i
have
been
taken
in
she
looks
a
girl
returned

and
besides
if
she
were
a
beauty
would
they
give
her
to
you
eh
my
dear
fellow
thirty
thousand
francs
and
the
influence
of
mme
de
senonches
and
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
many
a
small
landowner
would
be
wonderfully
glad
of
the
chance
and
all
the
more
so
since
francis
du
hautoy
is
never
likely
to
marry
and
all
that
he
has
will
go
to
the
girl
your
marriage
is
as
good
as
settled
how
that
is
what
i
am
just
going
to
tell
you

he
gave
his
companion
an
account
of
his
recent
bold
stroke

in
ten
years
time

man
to
draw
back
from
any
service

on
the
morrow
of
the
loss
announced
in
his
letter
he
obtained
a
for
his
passport
bought
a
stout
holly
stick
and
went
to
the
rue
to
take
a
place
in
the
little
market
van
which
took
him
as
far
as
longjumeau
for
half
a
franc
he
was
going
home
to
angouleme
at
the
end
of
the
first
day
tramp
he
slept
in
a
cowshed
two
leagues
from
arpajon
he
had
come
no
farther
than
orleans
before
he
was
very
weary
and
almost
ready
to
break
down
but
there
he
found
a
boatman
willing
to
bring
him
as
far
as
tours
for
three
francs
and
food
during
the
journey
cost
him
but
forty
sous
five
days
of
walking
brought
him
from
tours
to
poitiers
and
left
him
with
but
five
francs
in
his
pockets
but
he
summoned
up
all
his
remaining
strength
for
the
journey
before
him
he
was
overtaken
by
night
in
the
open
country
and
had
made
up
his
mind
to
sleep
out
of
doors
when
a
traveling
carriage
passed
by
slowly
climbing
the
hillside
and
all
unknown
to
the
postilion
the
occupants
and
the
servant
he
managed
to
slip
in
among
the
luggage
crouching
in
between
two
trunks
lest
he
should
be
shaken
off
by
the
jolting
of
the
carriage
and
so
he
slept
he
awoke
with
the
sun
shining
into
his
eyes
and
the
sound
of
voices
in
his
ears
the
carriage
had
come
to
a
standstill
looking
about
him
he
knew
that
he
was
at
mansle
the
little
town
where
he
had
waited
for
mme
de
bargeton
eighteen
months
before
when
his
heart
was
full
of
hope
and
love
and
joy
a
group
of
eyed
him
curiously
and
suspiciously
covered
with
dust
as
he
was
wedged
in
among
the
luggage
lucien
jumped
down
but
before
he
could
speak
two
travelers
stepped
out
of
the
caleche
and
the
words
died
away
on
his
lips
for
there
stood
the
new
prefect
of
the
charente
sixte
du
chatelet
and
his

gave
the
couple
a
distant
bow
and
a
glance
then
he
turned
away
into
a
road
in
search
of
some
farmhouse
where
he
might
make
a
breakfast
on
milk
and
bread
and
rest
awhile
and
think
quietly
over
the
future
he
still
had
three
francs
left
on
and
on
he
walked
with
the
hurrying
pace
of
fever
noticing
as
he
went
down
by
the
riverside
that
the
country
grew
more
and
more
picturesque
it
was
near
when
he
came
upon
a
sheet
of
water
with
willows
growing
about
the
margin
and
stopped
for
awhile
to
rest
his
eyes
on
the
cool
leaves
and
something
of
the
grace
of
the
fields
entered
into
his
soul
in
among
the
crests
of
the
willows
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
mill
on
a
branch
stream
and
of
the
thatched
roof
of
the
where
the
were
growing
for
all
ornament
the
quaint
cottage
was
covered
with
jessamine
and
honeysuckle
and
climbing
hops
and
the
garden
about
it
was
gay
with
phloxes
and
tall
plants
nets
lay
drying
in
the
sun
along
a
paved
causeway
raised
above
the
highest
flood
level
and
secured
by
massive
piles
ducks
were
swimming
in
the
clear
below
the
currents
of
water
roaring
over
the
wheel
as
the
poet
came
nearer
he
heard
the
clack
of
the
mill
and
saw
the
homely
woman
of
the
house
knitting
on
a
garden
bench
and
keeping
an
eye
upon
a
little
one
who
was
chasing
the
hens
about
lucien
came
forward
my
good
woman
he
said
i
am
tired
out
i
have
a
fever
on
me
and
i
have
only
three
francs
will
you
undertake
to
give
me
brown
bread
and
milk
and
let
me
sleep
in
the
barn
for
a
week
i
shall
have
time
to
write
to
my
people
and
they
will
either
come
to
fetch
me
or
send
me
money
i
am
quite
willing
always
supposing
that
my
husband
has
no
hey
little
man
the
miller
came
up
gave
lucien
a
look
over
and
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
to
remark
three
francs
for
a
weeks
board
you
might
as
well
pay
nothing
at
all
perhaps
i
shall
end
as
a
miller
man
thought
the
poet
as
his
eyes
wandered
over
the
lovely
country
then
the
miller
wife
made
a
bed
ready
for
him
and
lucien
lay
down
and
slept
so
long
that
his
hostess
was
frightened
courtois
she
said
next
day
at
noon
just
go
in
and
see
whether
that
young
man
is
dead
or
alive
he
has
been
lying
there
these
fourteen
hours
the
miller
was
busy
spreading
out
his
and
lines
it
is
my
belief
he
said
that
the
pretty
fellow
yonder
is
some
starveling
without
a
brass
farthing
to
bless
himself
with
what
makes
you
think
that
little
man
asked
the
mistress
of
the
mill
lord
he
is
not
a
prince
nor
a
lord
nor
a
member
of
parliament
nor
a
bishop
why
are
his
hands
as
white
as
if
he
did
nothing
then
it
is
very
strange
that
he
does
not
feel
hungry
and
wake
up
retorted
the
miller
wife
she
had
just
prepared
breakfast
for
yesterday
chance
guest
a
is
he
she
continued
where
will
he
be
going
it
is
too
early
yet
for
the
fair
at
angouleme
but
neither
the
miller
nor
his
wife
suspected
that
actors
princes
and
bishops
apart
there
is
a
kind
of
being
who
is
both
prince
and
actor
and
invested
besides
with
a
magnificent
order
of
priesthood
that
the
poet
seems
to
do
nothing
yet
reigns
over
all
humanity
when
he
can
paint
humanity
what
can
he
be
courtois
asked
of
his
wife
suppose
it
should
be
dangerous
to
take
him
in
queried
she
pooh
thieves
look
more
alive
than
that
we
should
have
been
robbed
by
this
time
returned
her
spouse
i
am
neither
a
prince
nor
a
thief
nor
a
bishop
nor
an
actor
lucien
said
wearily
he
must
have
overheard
the
colloquy
through
the
window
and
now
he
suddenly
appeared
i
am
poor
i
am
tired
out
i
have
come
on
foot
from
paris
my
name
is
lucien
de
rubempre
and
my
father
was
chardon
who
used
to
have
postel
business
in
my
sister
married
david
sechard
the
printer
in
the
place
du
murier
at
angouleme
stop
a
bit
said
the
miller
that
printer
is
the
son
of
the
old
skinflint
who
farms
his
own
land
at
marsac
is
he
the
very
same
said
lucien
he
is
a
queer
kind
of
father
he
is
courtois
continued
he
is
worth
two
hundred
thousand
francs
and
more
without
counting
his
and
he
has
sold
his
son
up
they
say
when
body
and
soul
have
been
broken
by
a
prolonged
painful
struggle
there
comes
a
crisis
when
a
strong
nature
braces
itself
for
greater
effort
but
those
who
give
way
under
the
strain
either
die
or
sink
into
unconsciousness
like
death
that
hour
of
crisis
had
struck
for
lucien
at
the
vague
rumor
of
the
catastrophe
that
had
befallen
david
he
seemed
almost
ready
to
succumb
oh
my
sister
he
cried
oh
god
what
have
i
done
base
wretch
that
i
am
he
dropped
down
on
the
wooden
bench
looking
white
and
powerless
as
a
dying
man
the
miller
wife
brought
out
a
bowl
of
milk
and
made
him
drink
but
he
begged
the
miller
to
help
him
back
to
his
bed
and
asked
to
be
forgiven
for
bringing
a
dying
man
into
their
house
he
thought
his
last
hour
had
come
with
the
shadow
of
death
thoughts
of
religion
crossed
a
brain
so
quick
to
conceive
picturesque
fancies
he
would
see
the
cure
he
would
confess
and
receive
the
last
sacraments
the
moan
uttered
in
the
faint
voice
by
a
young
man
with
such
a
comely
face
and
figure
went
to
mme
courtois
heart
i
say
little
man
just
take
the
horse
and
go
to
marsac
and
ask
marron
to
come
and
see
this
young
man
he
is
in
a
very
bad
way
it
seems
to
me
and
you
might
bring
the
cure
as
well
perhaps
they
may
know
more
about
that
printer
in
the
place
du
murier
than
you
do
for
postel
married
marron
daughter
courtois
departed
the
miller
wife
tried
to
make
lucien
take
food
like
all
folk
she
was
full
of
the
idea
that
sick
folk
must
be
made
to
eat
he
took
no
notice
of
her
but
gave
way
to
a
violent
storm
of
remorseful
grief
a
kind
of
mental
process
of
which
relieved
him
the
courtois
mill
lies
a
league
away
from
marsac
the
town
of
the
district
and
the
between
mansle
and
angouleme
so
it
was
not
long
before
the
good
miller
came
back
with
the
doctor
and
the
cure
both
functionaries
had
heard
rumors
coupling
lucien
name
with
the
name
of
mme
de
bargeton
and
now
when
the
whole
department
was
talking
of
the
lady
marriage
to
the
new
prefect
and
her
return
to
angouleme
as
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
both
cure
and
doctor
were
consumed
with
a
violent
curiosity
to
know
why
de
bargeton
widow
had
not
married
the
young
poet
with
whom
she
had
left
angouleme
and
when
they
heard
furthermore
that
lucien
was
at
the
mill
they
were
eager
to
know
whether
the
poet
had
come
to
the
rescue
of
his
curiosity
and
humanity
alike
prompted
them
to
go
at
once
to
the
dying
man
two
hours
after
courtois
set
out
lucien
heard
the
rattle
of
old
iron
over
the
stony
causeway
the
country
ramshackle
chaise
came
up
to
the
door
and
out
stepped
mm
marron
for
the
cure
was
the
doctor
uncle
lucien
bedside
visitors
were
as
intimate
with
david
father
as
country
neighbors
usually
are
in
a
small
township
the
doctor
looked
at
the
dying
man
felt
his
pulse
and
examined
his
tongue
then
he
looked
at
the
wife
and
smiled
reassuringly
mme
courtois
said
he
if
as
i
do
not
doubt
you
have
a
bottle
of
good
wine
somewhere
in
the
cellar
and
a
fat
eel
in
your
put
them
before
your
patient
it
is
only
exhaustion
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
him
our
great
man
will
be
on
his
feet
again
directly
ah
monsieur
said
lucien
it
is
not
the
body
it
is
the
mind
that
ails
these
good
people
have
told
me
tidings
that
nearly
killed
me
i
have
just
heard
the
bad
news
of
my
sister
mme
sechard
mme
courtois
says
that
your
daughter
is
married
to
postel
monsieur
so
you
must
know
something
of
david
sechard
affairs
oh
for
heaven
sake
monsieur
tell
me
what
you
know
why
he
must
be
in
prison
began
the
doctor
his
father
would
not
help
him
repeated
lucien
and
why
because
some
bills
came
from
paris
he
had
overlooked
them
no
doubt
for
he
does
not
pay
much
attention
to
his
business
they
say
said
marron
pray
leave
me
with
le
cure
said
the
poet
with
a
visible
change
of
countenance
the
doctor
and
the
miller
and
his
wife
went
out
of
the
room
and
lucien
was
left
alone
with
the
old
priest
sir
he
said
i
feel
that
death
is
near
and
i
deserve
to
die
i
am
a
very
miserable
wretch
i
can
only
cast
myself
into
the
arms
of
religion
i
sir
have
brought
all
these
troubles
on
my
sister
and
brother
for
david
sechard
has
been
a
brother
to
me
i
drew
those
bills
that
david
could
not
meet
i
have
ruined
him
in
my
terrible
misery
i
forgot
the
crime
a
millionaire
put
an
end
to
the
proceedings
and
i
quite
believed
that
he
had
met
the
bills
but
nothing
of
the
kind
has
been
done
it
seems
and
lucien
told
the
tale
of
his
sorrows
the
story
as
he
told
it
in
his
feverish
excitement
was
worthy
of
the
poet
he
besought
the
cure
to
go
to
angouleme
and
to
ask
for
news
of
eve
and
his
mother
mme
chardon
and
to
let
him
know
the
truth
and
whether
it
was
still
possible
to
repair
the
evil
i
shall
live
till
you
come
back
sir
he
added
as
the
hot
tears
fell
if
my
mother
and
sister
and
david
do
not
cast
me
off
i
shall
not
die
lucien
remorse
was
terrible
to
see
the
tears
the
eloquence
the
young
white
face
with
the
heartbroken
despairing
look
the
tales
of
sorrow
upon
sorrow
till
human
strength
could
no
more
endure
all
these
things
aroused
the
cure
pity
and
interest
in
the
provinces
as
in
paris
he
said
you
must
believe
only
half
of
all
that
you
hear
do
not
alarm
yourself
a
piece
of
hearsay
three
leagues
away
from
angouleme
is
sure
to
be
far
from
the
truth
old
sechard
our
neighbor
left
marsac
some
days
ago
very
likely
he
is
busy
settling
his
son
difficulties
i
am
going
to
angouleme
i
will
come
back
and
tell
you
whether
you
can
return
home
your
confessions
and
repentance
will
help
to
plead
your
cause
the
cure
did
not
know
that
lucien
had
repented
so
many
times
during
the
last
eighteen
months
that
penitence
however
impassioned
had
come
to
be
a
kind
of
drama
with
him
played
to
perfection
played
so
far
in
all
good
faith
but
none
the
less
a
drama
to
the
cure
succeeded
the
doctor
he
saw
that
the
patient
was
passing
through
a
nervous
crisis
and
the
danger
was
beginning
to
subside
the
spoke
as
comfortably
as
the
and
at
length
the
patient
was
persuaded
to
take
nourishment
meanwhile
the
cure
knowing
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
countryside
had
gone
to
mansle
the
coach
from
ruffec
to
angouleme
was
due
to
pass
about
that
time
and
he
found
a
vacant
place
in
it
he
would
go
to
his
postel
in
david
former
rival
and
make
inquiries
of
him
from
the
assiduity
with
which
the
little
druggist
assisted
his
venerable
relative
to
alight
from
the
abominable
cage
which
did
duty
as
a
coach
between
ruffec
and
angouleme
it
was
apparent
to
the
meanest
understanding
that
and
mme
postel
founded
their
hopes
of
future
ease
upon
the
old
will
have
you
breakfasted
will
you
take
something
we
did
not
in
the
least
expect
you
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
out
came
questions
innumerable
in
a
breath
mme
postel
might
have
been
born
to
be
the
wife
of
an
apothecary
in
she
was
a
woman
about
the
same
height
as
little
postel
himself
such
good
looks
as
she
possessed
being
entirely
due
to
youth
and
health
her
florid
auburn
hair
grew
very
low
upon
her
forehead
her
demeanor
and
language
were
in
keeping
with
homely
features
a
round
countenance
the
red
cheeks
of
a
country
damsel
and
eyes
that
might
almost
be
described
as
yellow
everything
about
her
said
plainly
enough
that
she
had
been
married
for
expectations
of
money
after
a
year
of
married
life
therefore
she
ruled
the
house
and
postel
only
too
happy
to
have
discovered
the
heiress
meekly
submitted
to
his
wife
mme
leonie
postel
marron
was
nursing
her
first
child
the
darling
of
the
old
cure
the
doctor
and
postel
a
repulsive
infant
with
a
strong
likeness
to
both
parents
well
uncle
said
leonie
what
has
brought
you
to
angouleme
since
you
will
not
take
anything
and
no
sooner
come
in
than
you
talk
of
going
but
when
the
venerable
ecclesiastic
brought
out
the
names
of
david
sechard
and
eve
little
postel
grew
very
red
and
leonie
his
wife
felt
it
incumbent
upon
her
to
give
him
a
jealous
glance
the
glance
that
a
wife
never
fails
to
give
when
she
is
perfectly
sure
of
her
husband
and
gives
a
look
into
the
past
by
way
of
a
caution
for
the
future
what
have
yonder
folk
done
to
you
uncle
that
you
should
mix
yourself
up
in
their
affairs
inquired
leonie
with
very
perceptible
tartness
they
are
in
trouble
my
girl
said
the
cure
and
he
told
the
postels
about
lucien
at
the
courtois
mill
oh
so
that
is
the
way
he
came
back
from
paris
is
it
exclaimed
postel
yet
he
had
some
brains
poor
fellow
and
he
was
ambitious
too
he
went
out
to
look
for
wool
and
comes
home
shorn
but
what
does
he
want
here
his
sister
is
frightfully
poor
for
all
these
geniuses
david
and
lucien
alike
know
very
little
about
business
there
was
some
talk
of
him
at
the
tribunal
and
as
judge
i
was
obliged
to
sign
the
warrant
of
execution
it
was
a
painful
duty
i
do
not
know
whether
the
sister
circumstances
are
such
that
lucien
can
go
to
her
but
in
any
case
the
little
room
that
he
used
to
occupy
here
is
at
liberty
and
i
shall
be
pleased
to
offer
it
to
him
that
is
right
postel
said
the
priest
he
bestowed
a
kiss
on
the
infant
slumbering
in
leonie
arms
and
adjusting
his
cocked
hat
prepared
to
walk
out
of
the
shop
you
will
dine
with
us
uncle
of
course
said
mme
postel
if
once
you
meddle
in
these
people
affairs
it
will
be
some
time
before
you
have
done
my
husband
will
drive
you
back
again
in
his
little
husband
and
wife
stood
watching
their
valued
aged
relative
on
his
way
into
angouleme
he
carries
himself
well
for
his
age
all
the
same
remarked
the
druggist
by
this
time
david
had
been
in
hiding
for
eleven
days
in
a
house
only
two
doors
away
from
the
druggist
shop
which
the
worthy
ecclesiastic
had
just
quitted
to
climb
the
steep
path
into
angouleme
with
the
news
of
lucien
present
condition
when
the
abbe
marron
debouched
upon
the
place
du
murier
he
found
three
men
each
one
remarkable
in
his
own
way
and
all
of
them
bearing
with
their
whole
weight
upon
the
present
and
future
of
the
hapless
voluntary
prisoner
there
stood
old
sechard
the
tall
cointet
and
his
confederate
the
puny
limb
of
the
law
three
men
representing
three
phases
of
greed
as
widely
different
as
the
outward
forms
of
the
speakers
the
first
had
it
in
his
mind
to
sell
his
own
son
the
second
to
betray
his
client
and
the
third
while
bargaining
for
both
iniquities
was
inwardly
resolved
to
pay
for
neither
it
was
nearly
five
on
their
way
home
to
dinner
stopped
a
moment
to
look
at
the
group
what
the
devil
can
old
sechard
and
the
tall
cointet
have
to
say
to
each
other
asked
the
more
curious
there
was
something
on
foot
concerning
that
miserable
wretch
that
leaves
his
wife
and
child
and
to
starve
suggested
some
talk
of
sending
a
boy
to
paris
to
learn
his
trade
said
a
provincial
oracle
le
cure
what
brings
you
here
eh
exclaimed
old
sechard
catching
sight
of
the
abbe
as
soon
as
he
appeared
i
have
come
on
account
of
your
family
answered
the
old
man
here
is
another
of
my
son
notions
exclaimed
old
sechard
it
would
not
cost
you
much
to
make
everybody
happy
all
round
said
the
priest
looking
at
the
windows
of
the
mme
sechard
beautiful
face
appeared
at
that
moment
between
the
curtains
she
was
hushing
her
child
cries
by
tossing
him
in
her
arms
and
singing
to
him
are
you
bringing
news
of
my
son
asked
old
sechard
or
what
is
more
to
the
purpose
money
no
answered
marron
i
am
bringing
the
sister
news
of
her
brother
of
lucien
cried
yes
he
walked
all
the
way
from
paris
poor
young
man
i
found
him
at
the
courtois
house
he
was
worn
out
with
misery
and
fatigue
oh
he
is
very
much
to
be
pitied
took
the
tall
cointet
by
the
arm
saying
aloud
if
we
are
going
to
dine
with
mme
de
senonches
it
is
time
to
dress
when
they
had
come
away
a
few
paces
he
added
for
his
companion
benefit
catch
the
cub
and
you
will
soon
have
the
dam
we
have
david
now
i
have
found
you
a
wife
find
me
a
partner
said
the
tall
cointet
with
a
treacherous
smile
lucien
is
an
old
of
mine
we
used
to
be
chums
i
shall
be
sure
to
hear
something
from
him
in
a
week
time
have
the
banns
put
up
and
i
will
engage
to
put
david
in
prison
when
he
is
on
the
jailer
register
i
shall
have
done
my
part
ah
exclaimed
the
tall
cointet
under
his
breath
we
might
have
the
patent
taken
out
in
our
name
that
would
be
the
thing
a
shiver
ran
through
the
meagre
little
attorney
when
he
heard
those
words
meanwhile
eve
beheld
her
enter
with
the
abbe
marron
who
had
let
fall
a
word
which
unfolded
the
whole
tragedy
here
is
our
cure
mme
sechard
the
old
man
said
addressing
his
and
pretty
tales
about
your
brother
he
has
to
tell
us
no
doubt
oh
cried
poor
eve
cut
to
the
heart
what
can
have
happened
now
the
cry
told
so
unmistakably
of
many
sorrows
of
great
dread
on
so
many
grounds
that
the
abbe
marron
made
haste
to
say
reassure
yourself
madame
he
is
living
eve
turned
to
the
vinegrower
father
she
said
perhaps
you
will
be
good
enough
to
go
to
my
mother
she
must
hear
all
that
this
gentleman
has
to
tell
us
of
lucien
the
old
man
went
in
search
of
mme
chardon
and
addressed
her
in
this
wise
go
and
have
it
out
with
the
abbe
marron
he
is
a
good
sort
priest
though
he
is
dinner
will
be
late
no
doubt
i
shall
come
back
again
in
an
hour
and
the
old
man
went
out
insensible
as
he
was
to
everything
but
the
clink
of
money
and
the
glitter
of
gold
he
left
mme
chardon
without
caring
to
notice
the
effect
of
the
shock
that
he
had
given
her
mme
chardon
had
changed
so
greatly
during
the
last
eighteen
months
that
in
that
short
time
she
no
longer
looked
like
the
same
woman
the
troubles
hanging
over
both
of
her
children
her
abortive
hopes
for
lucien
the
unexpected
deterioration
in
one
in
whose
powers
and
honesty
she
had
for
so
long
believed
all
these
things
had
told
heavily
upon
her
mme
chardon
was
not
only
noble
by
birth
she
was
noble
by
nature
she
idolized
her
children
consequently
during
the
last
six
months
she
had
suffered
as
never
before
since
her
widowhood
lucien
might
have
borne
the
name
of
lucien
de
rubempre
by
royal
letters
patent
he
might
have
founded
the
family
anew
revived
the
title
and
borne
the
arms
he
might
have
made
a
great
name
he
had
thrown
the
chance
away
nay
he
had
fallen
into
the
mire
for
mme
chardon
the
mother
was
a
harder
judge
than
eve
the
sister
when
she
heard
of
the
bills
she
looked
upon
lucien
as
lost
a
mother
is
often
fain
to
shut
her
eyes
but
she
always
knows
the
child
that
she
held
at
her
breast
the
child
that
has
been
always
with
her
in
the
house
and
so
when
eve
and
david
discussed
lucien
chances
of
success
in
paris
and
lucien
mother
to
all
appearance
shared
illusions
in
her
inmost
heart
there
was
a
tremor
of
fear
lest
david
should
be
right
for
a
mother
consciousness
bore
a
witness
to
the
truth
of
his
words
so
well
did
she
know
eve
sensitive
nature
that
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
speak
of
her
fears
she
was
obliged
to
choke
them
down
and
keep
such
silence
as
mothers
alone
can
keep
when
they
know
how
to
love
their
children
and
eve
on
her
side
had
watched
her
mother
and
saw
the
ravages
of
hidden
grief
with
a
feeling
of
dread
her
mother
was
not
growing
old
she
was
failing
from
day
to
day
mother
and
daughter
lived
a
live
of
generous
deception
and
neither
was
deceived
the
brutal
old
vinegrower
speech
was
the
last
drop
that
filled
the
cup
of
affliction
to
overflowing
the
words
struck
a
chill
to
mme
heart
here
is
my
mother
monsieur
said
eve
and
the
abbe
looking
up
saw
a
woman
with
a
face
as
thin
and
worn
as
the
features
of
some
aged
nun
and
yet
grown
beautiful
with
the
calm
and
sweet
expression
that
devout
submission
gives
to
the
faces
of
women
who
walk
by
the
will
of
god
as
the
saying
is
then
the
abbe
understood
the
lives
of
the
mother
and
daughter
and
had
no
more
sympathy
left
for
lucien
he
shuddered
to
think
of
all
that
the
victims
had
endured
mother
said
eve
drying
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
poor
lucien
is
not
very
far
away
he
is
at
marsac
and
why
is
he
not
here
asked
mme
chardon
then
the
abbe
told
the
whole
story
as
lucien
had
told
it
to
him
the
misery
of
the
journey
the
troubles
of
the
last
days
in
paris
he
described
the
poet
agony
of
mind
when
he
heard
of
the
havoc
wrought
at
home
by
his
imprudence
and
his
apprehension
as
to
the
reception
awaiting
him
at
angouleme
he
has
doubts
of
us
has
it
come
to
this
said
mme
chardon
the
unhappy
young
man
has
come
back
to
you
on
foot
enduring
the
most
terrible
hardships
by
the
way
he
is
prepared
to
enter
the
humblest
walks
in
life
if
so
he
may
make
reparation
monsieur
lucien
sister
said
in
spite
of
the
wrong
he
has
done
us
i
love
my
brother
still
as
we
love
the
dead
body
when
the
soul
has
left
it
and
even
so
i
love
him
more
than
many
sisters
love
their
brothers
he
has
made
us
poor
indeed
but
let
him
come
to
us
he
shall
share
the
last
crust
of
bread
anything
indeed
that
he
has
left
us
oh
if
he
had
never
left
us
monsieur
we
should
not
have
lost
our
heart
treasure
and
the
woman
who
took
him
from
us
brought
him
back
on
her
carriage
exclaimed
mme
chardon
he
went
away
sitting
by
mme
de
side
in
her
caleche
and
he
came
back
behind
it
can
i
do
anything
for
you
asked
the
good
cure
seeking
an
opportunity
to
take
leave
a
wound
in
the
purse
is
not
fatal
they
say
monsieur
said
mme
chardon
but
the
patient
must
be
his
own
doctor
if
you
have
sufficient
influence
with
my
to
induce
him
to
help
his
son
you
would
save
a
whole
family
said
eve
he
has
no
belief
in
you
and
he
seemed
to
me
to
be
very
much
exasperated
against
your
husband
answered
the
old
cure
he
retained
an
impression
from
the
rambling
talk
that
the
sechards
affairs
were
a
kind
of
wasps
nest
with
which
it
was
imprudent
to
meddle
and
his
mission
being
fulfilled
he
went
to
dine
with
his
nephew
postel
that
worthy
like
the
rest
of
angouleme
maintained
that
the
father
was
in
the
right
and
soon
dissipated
any
little
benevolence
that
the
old
gentleman
was
disposed
to
feel
towards
the
son
and
his
family
with
those
that
squander
money
something
may
be
done
concluded
little
postel
but
those
that
make
experiments
are
the
ruin
of
you
the
cure
went
home
his
curiosity
was
thoroughly
satisfied
and
this
is
the
end
and
object
of
the
exceeding
interest
taken
in
other
people
business
in
the
provinces
in
the
course
of
the
evening
the
poet
was
duly
informed
of
all
that
had
passed
in
the
sechard
family
and
the
journey
was
represented
as
a
pilgrimage
undertaken
from
motives
of
the
purest
charity
you
have
run
your
and
sister
into
debt
to
the
amount
of
ten
or
twelve
thousand
francs
said
the
abbe
as
he
drew
to
an
end
and
nobody
hereabouts
has
that
trifling
amount
to
lend
a
neighbor
my
dear
sir
we
are
not
rich
in
angoumois
when
you
spoke
to
me
of
your
bills
i
thought
that
a
much
smaller
amount
was
involved
lucien
thanked
the
old
man
for
his
good
offices
the
promise
of
forgiveness
which
you
have
brought
is
for
me
a
priceless
gift
very
early
the
next
morning
lucien
set
out
from
marsac
and
reached
angouleme
towards
nine
he
carried
nothing
but
his
the
short
jacket
that
he
wore
was
considerably
the
worst
for
his
journey
his
black
trousers
were
whitened
with
dust
and
a
pair
of
worn
boots
told
sufficiently
plainly
that
their
owner
belonged
to
the
hapless
tribe
of
tramps
he
knew
well
enough
that
the
contrast
between
his
departure
and
return
was
bound
to
strike
his
he
did
not
try
to
hide
the
fact
from
himself
but
just
then
with
his
heart
swelling
beneath
the
oppression
of
remorse
awakened
in
him
by
the
old
cure
story
he
accepted
his
punishment
for
the
moment
and
made
up
his
mind
to
brave
the
eyes
of
his
acquaintances
within
himself
he
said
i
am
behaving
heroically
poetic
temperaments
of
this
stamp
begin
as
their
own
dupes
he
walked
up
through
shame
at
the
manner
of
his
return
struggling
with
the
charm
of
old
associations
as
he
went
his
heart
beat
quickly
as
he
passed
postel
shop
but
very
luckily
for
him
the
only
persons
inside
it
were
leonie
and
her
child
and
yet
vanity
was
still
so
strong
in
him
that
he
could
feel
glad
that
his
father
name
had
been
painted
out
on
the
for
postel
since
his
marriage
had
redecorated
his
abode
and
the
word
pharmacy
now
alone
appeared
there
in
the
paris
fashion
in
big
letters
when
lucien
reached
the
steps
by
the
palet
gate
he
felt
the
influence
of
his
native
air
his
misfortunes
no
longer
weighed
upon
him
i
shall
see
them
again
he
said
to
himself
with
a
thrill
of
delight
he
reached
the
place
du
murier
and
had
not
met
a
soul
a
piece
of
luck
that
he
scarcely
hoped
for
he
who
once
had
gone
about
his
native
place
with
a
conqueror
air
marion
and
kolb
on
guard
at
the
door
flew
out
upon
the
steps
crying
out
here
he
is
lucien
saw
the
familiar
workshop
and
courtyard
and
on
the
staircase
met
his
mother
and
sister
and
for
a
moment
while
their
arms
were
about
him
all
three
almost
forgot
their
troubles
in
family
life
we
almost
always
compound
with
our
misfortunes
we
make
a
sort
of
bed
to
rest
upon
and
if
it
is
hard
hope
to
make
it
tolerable
if
lucien
looked
the
picture
of
despair
poetic
charm
was
not
wanting
to
the
picture
his
face
had
been
tanned
by
the
sunlight
of
the
open
road
and
the
deep
sadness
visible
in
his
features
overshadowed
his
brow
the
change
in
him
told
so
plainly
of
sufferings
endured
his
face
was
so
worn
by
sharp
misery
that
no
one
could
help
pitying
him
imagination
had
fared
forth
into
the
world
and
found
sad
reality
at
the
eve
was
smiling
in
the
midst
of
her
joy
as
the
saints
smile
upon
martyrdom
the
face
of
a
young
and
very
fair
woman
grows
sublimely
beautiful
at
the
touch
of
grief
lucien
remembered
the
innocent
girlish
face
that
he
saw
last
before
he
went
to
paris
and
the
look
of
gravity
that
had
come
over
it
spoke
so
eloquently
that
he
could
not
but
feel
a
painful
impression
the
first
quick
natural
outpouring
of
affection
was
followed
at
once
by
a
reaction
on
either
side
they
were
afraid
to
speak
and
when
lucien
almost
involuntarily
looked
round
for
another
who
should
have
been
there
eve
burst
into
tears
and
lucien
did
the
same
but
mme
chardon
haggard
face
showed
no
sign
of
emotion
eve
rose
to
her
feet
and
went
downstairs
partly
to
spare
her
brother
a
word
of
reproach
partly
to
speak
to
marion
lucien
is
so
fond
of
strawberries
child
we
must
find
some
strawberries
for
him
oh
i
was
sure
that
you
would
want
to
welcome
lucien
you
shall
have
a
nice
little
breakfast
and
a
good
dinner
too
lucien
said
mme
chardon
when
the
mother
and
son
were
left
alone
you
have
a
great
deal
to
repair
here
you
went
away
that
we
all
might
be
proud
of
you
you
have
plunged
us
into
want
you
have
all
but
destroyed
your
brother
opportunity
of
making
a
fortune
that
he
only
cared
to
win
for
the
sake
of
his
new
family
nor
is
this
all
that
you
have
destroyed
said
the
mother
there
was
a
dreadful
pause
lucien
took
his
mother
reproaches
in
silence
now
begin
to
work
mme
chardon
went
on
more
gently
you
tried
to
revive
the
noble
family
of
whom
i
come
i
do
not
blame
you
for
it
but
the
man
who
undertakes
such
a
task
needs
money
above
all
things
and
must
bear
a
high
heart
in
him
both
were
wanting
in
your
case
we
believed
in
you
once
our
belief
has
been
shaken
this
was
a
contented
household
making
its
way
with
difficulty
you
have
troubled
their
peace
the
first
offence
may
be
forgiven
but
it
must
be
the
last
we
are
in
a
very
difficult
position
here
you
must
be
careful
and
take
your
sister
advice
lucien
the
school
of
trouble
is
a
very
hard
one
but
eve
has
learned
much
by
her
lessons
she
has
grown
grave
and
thoughtful
she
is
a
mother
in
her
devotion
to
our
dear
david
she
has
taken
all
the
family
burdens
upon
herself
indeed
through
your
wrongdoing
she
has
come
to
be
my
only
comfort
you
might
be
still
more
severe
my
mother
lucien
said
as
he
kissed
her
i
accept
your
forgiveness
for
i
will
not
need
it
a
second
time
eve
came
into
the
room
saw
her
brother
humble
attitude
and
knew
that
he
had
been
forgiven
her
kindness
brought
a
smile
for
him
to
her
lips
and
lucien
answered
with
eyes
a
living
presence
acts
like
a
charm
changing
the
most
hostile
positions
of
lovers
or
of
families
no
matter
how
just
the
resentment
is
it
that
affection
finds
out
the
ways
of
the
heart
and
we
love
to
fall
into
them
again
does
the
phenomenon
come
within
the
province
of
the
science
of
magnetism
or
is
it
reason
that
tells
us
that
we
must
either
forgive
or
never
see
each
other
again
whether
the
cause
be
referred
to
mental
physical
or
spiritual
conditions
everyone
knows
the
effect
every
one
has
felt
that
the
looks
the
actions
or
gestures
of
the
beloved
awaken
some
vestige
of
tenderness
in
those
most
deeply
sinned
against
and
grievously
wronged
though
it
is
hard
for
the
mind
to
forget
though
we
still
smart
under
the
injury
the
heart
returns
to
its
allegiance
in
spite
of
all
poor
eve
listened
to
her
confidences
until
and
whenever
she
looked
at
him
she
was
no
longer
mistress
of
her
eyes
in
that
intimate
talk
she
could
not
control
her
voice
and
with
the
comprehension
of
the
conditions
of
literary
life
in
paris
she
understood
that
the
struggle
had
been
too
much
for
lucien
strength
the
poet
delight
as
he
caressed
his
sister
child
his
deep
grief
over
david
absence
mingled
with
joy
at
seeing
his
country
and
his
own
folk
again
the
melancholy
words
that
he
let
fall
all
these
things
combined
to
make
that
day
a
festival
when
marion
brought
in
the
strawberries
he
was
touched
to
see
that
eve
had
remembered
his
taste
in
spite
of
her
distress
and
she
his
sister
must
make
ready
a
room
for
the
prodigal
brother
and
busy
herself
for
lucien
it
was
a
truce
as
it
were
to
misery
old
sechard
himself
assisted
to
bring
about
this
revulsion
of
feeling
in
the
two
women
you
are
making
as
much
of
him
as
if
he
were
bringing
you
any
amount
of
money
and
what
has
my
brother
done
that
we
should
not
make
much
of
him
cried
eve
jealously
screening
lucien
nevertheless
when
the
first
expansion
was
over
shades
of
truth
came
out
it
was
not
long
before
lucien
felt
the
difference
between
the
old
affection
and
the
new
eve
respected
david
from
the
depths
of
her
heart
lucien
was
beloved
for
his
own
sake
as
we
love
a
mistress
still
in
spite
of
the
disasters
she
causes
esteem
the
very
foundation
on
which
affection
is
based
is
the
solid
stuff
to
which
affection
owes
i
know
not
what
of
certainty
and
security
by
which
we
live
and
this
was
lacking
between
mme
chardon
and
her
son
between
the
sister
and
the
brother
mother
and
daughter
did
not
put
entire
confidence
in
him
as
they
would
have
done
if
he
had
not
lost
his
honor
and
he
felt
this
the
opinion
expressed
in
letter
was
eve
own
estimate
of
her
brother
unconsciously
she
revealed
it
by
her
manner
tones
and
gestures
oh
lucien
was
pitied
that
was
true
but
as
for
all
that
he
had
been
the
pride
of
the
household
the
great
man
of
the
family
the
hero
of
the
fireside
all
this
like
their
fair
hopes
of
him
was
gone
never
to
return
they
were
so
afraid
of
his
heedlessness
that
he
was
not
told
where
david
was
hidden
lucien
wanted
to
see
his
brother
but
this
eve
insensible
to
the
caresses
which
accompanied
his
curious
questionings
was
not
the
eve
of
for
whom
a
glance
from
him
had
been
an
order
that
must
be
obeyed
when
lucien
spoke
of
making
reparation
and
talked
as
though
he
could
rescue
david
eve
only
answered
do
not
interfere
we
have
enemies
of
the
most
treacherous
and
dangerous
kind
lucien
tossed
his
head
as
one
who
should
say
i
have
measured
myself
against
parisians
and
the
look
in
his
sister
eyes
said
unmistakably
yes
but
you
were
defeated
nobody
cares
for
me
now
lucien
thought
in
the
home
circle
as
in
the
world
without
success
is
a
necessity
the
poet
tried
to
explain
their
lack
of
confidence
in
him
he
had
not
been
at
home
two
days
before
a
feeling
of
vexation
rather
than
of
angry
bitterness
gained
hold
on
him
he
applied
parisian
standards
to
the
quiet
temperate
existence
of
the
provinces
quite
forgetting
that
the
narrow
patient
life
of
the
household
was
the
result
of
his
own
misdoings
they
are
they
can
not
understand
me
he
said
setting
himself
apart
from
his
sister
and
mother
and
david
now
that
they
could
no
longer
be
deceived
as
to
his
real
character
and
his
future
many
troubles
and
shocks
of
fortune
had
quickened
the
intuitive
sense
in
both
the
women
eve
and
mme
chardon
guessed
the
thoughts
in
lucien
inmost
soul
they
felt
that
he
misjudged
them
they
saw
him
mentally
isolating
himself
paris
has
changed
him
very
much
they
said
between
themselves
they
were
indeed
reaping
the
harvest
of
egoism
which
they
themselves
had
fostered
it
was
inevitable
but
that
the
leaven
should
work
in
all
three
and
this
most
of
all
in
lucien
because
he
felt
that
he
was
so
heavily
to
blame
as
for
eve
she
was
just
the
kind
of
sister
to
beg
an
erring
brother
to
forgive
me
for
your
trespasses
but
when
the
union
of
two
souls
had
been
as
perfect
since
life
very
beginnings
as
it
had
been
with
eve
and
lucien
any
blow
dealt
to
that
fair
ideal
is
fatal
scoundrels
can
draw
knives
on
each
other
and
make
it
up
again
afterwards
while
a
look
or
a
word
is
enough
to
sunder
two
lovers
for
ever
in
the
recollection
of
an
almost
perfect
life
of
heart
and
heart
lies
the
secret
of
many
an
estrangement
that
none
can
explain
two
may
live
together
without
full
trust
in
their
hearts
if
only
their
past
holds
no
memories
of
complete
and
unclouded
love
but
for
those
who
once
have
known
that
intimate
life
it
becomes
intolerable
to
keep
perpetual
watch
over
looks
and
words
great
poets
know
this
paul
and
virginie
die
before
youth
is
over
can
we
think
of
paul
and
virginie
estranged
let
us
know
that
to
the
honor
of
lucien
and
eve
the
grave
injury
done
was
not
the
source
of
the
pain
it
was
entirely
a
matter
of
feeling
upon
either
side
for
the
poet
in
fault
as
for
the
sister
who
was
in
no
way
to
blame
things
had
reached
the
point
when
the
slightest
misunderstanding
or
little
quarrel
or
a
fresh
disappointment
in
lucien
would
end
in
final
estrangement
money
difficulties
may
be
arranged
but
feelings
are
inexorable
next
day
lucien
received
a
copy
of
the
local
paper
he
turned
pale
with
pleasure
when
he
saw
his
name
at
the
head
of
one
of
the
first
leaders
in
that
highly
respectable
sheet
which
like
the
provincial
academies
that
voltaire
compared
to
a
miss
was
never
talked
about
let
boast
of
giving
the
light
to
victor
hugo
to
charles
nodier
and
cuvier
ran
the
article
brittany
of
producing
a
chateaubriand
and
a
lammenais
normandy
of
casimir
delavigne
and
touraine
of
the
author
of
angoumois
that
gave
birth
in
the
days
of
louis
to
our
illustrious
guez
better
known
under
the
name
of
balzac
our
angoumois
need
no
longer
envy
limousin
her
dupuytren
nor
auvergne
the
country
of
montlosier
nor
bordeaux
birthplace
of
so
many
great
men
for
we
too
have
our
poet
the
writer
of
the
beautiful
sonnets
entitled
the
unites
his
poet
fame
to
the
distinction
of
a
prose
writer
for
to
him
we
also
owe
the
magnificent
romance
of
archer
of
charles
some
day
our
nephews
will
be
proud
to
be
the
of
lucien
chardon
a
rival
of
petrarch
the
country
newspapers
of
those
days
were
sown
with
notes
of
admiration
as
reports
of
english
election
speeches
are
studded
with
cheers
in
brackets
in
spite
of
his
brilliant
success
in
paris
our
young
poet
has
not
forgotten
the
hotel
de
bargeton
the
cradle
of
his
triumphs
nor
the
fact
that
the
wife
of
le
comte
du
chatelet
our
prefect
encouraged
his
early
footsteps
in
the
pathway
of
the
muses
he
has
come
back
among
us
once
more
all
was
thrown
into
excitement
yesterday
by
the
appearance
of
our
lucien
de
rubempre
the
news
of
his
return
produced
a
profound
sensation
throughout
the
town
angouleme
certainly
will
not
allow
to
be
beforehand
in
doing
honor
to
the
poet
who
in
journalism
and
literature
has
so
gloriously
represented
our
town
in
paris
lucien
de
rubempre
a
religious
and
royalist
poet
has
braved
the
fury
of
parties
he
has
come
home
it
is
said
for
repose
after
the
fatigue
of
a
struggle
which
would
try
the
strength
of
an
even
greater
intellectual
athlete
than
a
poet
and
a
dreamer
there
is
some
talk
of
restoring
our
great
poet
to
the
title
of
the
illustrious
house
of
de
rubempre
of
which
his
mother
madame
chardon
is
the
last
survivor
and
it
is
added
that
mme
la
comtesse
du
chatelet
was
the
first
to
think
of
this
eminently
politic
idea
the
revival
of
an
ancient
and
almost
extinct
family
by
young
talent
and
newly
won
fame
is
another
proof
that
the
immortal
author
of
the
charter
still
cherishes
the
desire
expressed
by
the
words
and
oblivion
our
poet
is
staying
with
his
sister
mme
sechard
under
the
heading
angouleme
followed
some
items
of
news
our
prefect
le
comte
du
chatelet
gentleman
in
ordinary
to
his
majesty
has
just
been
appointed
extraordinary
councillor
of
state
all
the
authorities
called
yesterday
on
le
prefet
mme
la
comtesse
du
chatelet
will
receive
on
thursdays
the
mayor
of
escarbas
de
negrepelisse
the
representative
of
the
younger
branch
of
the
family
and
father
of
mme
du
chatelet
recently
raised
to
the
rank
of
a
count
and
peer
of
france
and
a
commander
of
the
royal
order
of
louis
has
been
nominated
for
the
presidency
of
the
electoral
college
of
angouleme
at
the
forthcoming
elections
there
said
lucien
taking
the
paper
to
his
sister
eve
read
the
article
with
attention
and
returned
with
the
sheet
with
a
thoughtful
air
what
do
you
say
to
that
asked
he
surprised
at
a
reserve
that
seemed
so
like
indifference
the
cointets
are
proprietors
of
that
paper
dear
she
said
they
put
in
exactly
what
they
please
and
it
is
not
at
all
likely
that
the
prefecture
or
the
palace
have
forced
their
hands
can
you
imagine
that
your
old
rival
the
prefect
would
be
generous
enough
to
sing
your
praises
have
you
forgotten
that
the
cointets
are
suing
us
under
metivier
name
and
that
they
are
trying
to
turn
david
discovery
to
their
own
advantage
i
do
not
know
the
source
of
this
paragraph
but
it
makes
me
uneasy
you
used
to
rouse
nothing
but
envious
feeling
and
hatred
here
a
prophet
has
no
honor
in
his
own
country
and
they
slandered
you
and
now
in
a
moment
it
is
all
changed
you
do
not
know
the
vanity
of
country
towns
said
lucien
a
whole
little
town
in
the
south
turned
out
not
so
long
ago
to
welcome
a
young
man
that
had
won
the
first
prize
in
some
competition
they
looked
on
him
as
a
budding
great
man
listen
dear
lucien
i
do
not
want
to
preach
to
you
i
will
say
everything
in
a
very
few
words
you
must
suspect
every
little
thing
here
you
are
right
said
lucien
but
he
was
surprised
at
his
lack
of
enthusiasm
he
himself
was
full
of
delight
to
find
his
humiliating
and
return
to
angouleme
changed
into
a
triumph
in
this
way
you
have
no
belief
in
the
little
fame
that
has
cost
so
dear
he
said
again
after
a
long
silence
something
like
a
storm
had
been
gathering
in
his
heart
during
the
past
hour
for
all
answer
eve
gave
him
a
look
and
lucien
felt
ashamed
of
his
accusation
dinner
was
scarcely
over
when
a
messenger
came
from
the
prefecture
with
a
note
addressed
to
chardon
that
note
appeared
to
decide
the
day
for
the
poet
vanity
the
world
contending
against
the
family
for
him
had
won
le
comte
sixte
du
chatelet
and
mme
la
comtesse
du
chatelet
request
the
honor
of
lucien
chardon
company
at
dinner
on
the
fifteenth
of
september
enclosed
with
the
invitation
there
was
a
card
le
comte
sixte
du
chatelet
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
prefect
of
the
charente
councillor
of
state
you
are
in
favor
said
old
sechard
they
are
talking
about
you
in
the
town
as
if
you
were
somebody
angouleme
and
are
disputing
as
to
which
shall
twist
wreaths
for
you
eve
dear
lucien
whispered
to
his
sister
i
am
exactly
in
the
same
condition
as
i
was
before
in
when
mme
de
bargeton
sent
me
the
first
invitation
i
have
not
a
dress
suit
for
the
do
you
really
mean
to
accept
the
invitation
eve
asked
in
alarm
and
a
dispute
sprang
up
between
the
brother
and
sister
eve
provincial
good
sense
told
her
that
if
you
appear
in
society
it
must
be
with
a
smiling
face
and
faultless
costume
what
will
come
of
the
dinner
she
wondered
what
has
lucien
to
do
with
the
great
people
of
angouleme
are
they
plotting
something
against
him
but
she
kept
these
thoughts
to
herself
lucien
spoke
the
last
word
at
bedtime
you
do
not
know
my
influence
the
prefect
wife
stands
in
fear
of
a
journalist
and
besides
louise
de
negrepelisse
lives
on
in
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
and
a
woman
with
her
influence
can
rescue
david
i
am
going
to
tell
her
about
my
brother
invention
and
it
would
be
a
mere
nothing
to
her
to
obtain
a
subsidy
of
ten
thousand
francs
from
the
government
for
him
at
eleven
that
night
the
whole
household
was
awakened
by
the
town
band
reinforced
by
the
military
band
from
the
barracks
the
place
du
murier
was
full
of
people
the
young
men
of
angouleme
were
giving
lucien
chardon
de
rubempre
a
serenade
lucien
went
to
his
sister
window
and
made
a
speech
after
the
last
performance
i
thank
my
for
the
honor
that
they
do
me
he
said
in
the
midst
of
a
great
silence
i
will
strive
to
be
worthy
of
it
they
will
pardon
me
if
i
say
no
more
i
am
so
much
moved
by
this
incident
that
i
can
not
speak
hurrah
for
the
writer
of
archer
of
charles
hurrah
for
the
poet
of
the
long
live
lucien
de
rubempre
after
these
three
salvos
taken
up
by
some
few
voices
three
crowns
and
a
quantity
of
bouquets
were
adroitly
flung
into
the
room
through
the
open
window
ten
minutes
later
the
place
du
murier
was
empty
and
silence
prevailed
in
the
streets
i
would
rather
have
ten
thousand
francs
said
old
sechard
fingering
the
bouquets
and
garlands
with
a
satirical
expression
you
gave
them
daisies
and
they
give
you
posies
in
return
you
deal
in
flowers
so
that
is
your
opinion
of
the
honors
shown
me
by
my
is
it
asked
lucien
all
his
melancholy
had
left
him
his
face
was
radiant
with
good
humor
if
you
knew
mankind
papa
sechard
you
would
see
that
no
moment
in
one
life
comes
twice
such
a
triumph
as
this
can
only
be
due
to
genuine
enthusiasm
my
dear
mother
my
good
sister
this
wipes
out
many
mortifications
lucien
kissed
them
for
when
joy
overflows
like
a
torrent
flood
we
are
fain
to
pour
it
out
into
a
friend
heart
when
an
author
is
intoxicated
with
success
he
will
hug
his
porter
if
there
is
nobody
else
on
hand
according
to
bixiou
why
darling
why
are
you
crying
he
said
looking
into
eve
face
ah
i
know
you
are
crying
for
joy
oh
me
said
her
mother
shaking
her
head
as
she
spoke
lucien
has
forgotten
everything
already
not
merely
his
own
troubles
but
ours
as
well
mother
and
daughter
separated
and
neither
dared
to
utter
all
her
thoughts
in
a
country
eaten
up
with
the
kind
of
social
insubordination
disguised
by
the
word
equality
a
triumph
of
any
kind
whatsoever
is
a
sort
of
miracle
which
requires
like
some
other
miracles
for
that
matter
the
of
skilled
labor
out
of
ten
ovations
offered
to
ten
living
men
selected
for
this
distinction
by
a
grateful
country
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
nine
are
given
from
considerations
connected
as
remotely
as
possible
with
the
conspicuous
merits
of
the
renowned
recipient
what
was
voltaire
apotheosis
at
the
but
the
triumph
of
eighteenth
century
philosophy
a
triumph
in
france
means
that
everybody
else
feels
that
he
is
adorning
his
own
temples
with
the
crown
that
he
sets
on
the
idol
head
the
women
presentiments
proved
correct
the
distinguished
provincial
reception
was
antipathetic
to
angoumoisin
immobility
it
was
too
evidently
got
up
by
some
interested
persons
or
by
enthusiastic
stage
mechanics
a
suspicious
combination
eve
moreover
like
most
of
her
sex
was
distrustful
by
instinct
even
when
reason
failed
to
justify
her
suspicions
to
herself
who
can
be
so
fond
of
lucien
that
he
could
rouse
the
town
for
him
she
wondered
as
she
fell
asleep
the
are
not

yet
how
can
they
compliment
him
on
a
future
success
the
ovation
was
in
fact
the
work
of
had
dined
with
mme
de
senonches
for
the
first
time
on
the
evening
of
the
day
that
brought
the
cure
of
marsac
to
angouleme
with
the
news
of
lucien
return
that
same
evening
he
made
formal
application
for
the
hand
of
mlle
de
la
haye
it
was
a
family
dinner
one
of
the
solemn
occasions
marked
not
so
much
by
the
number
of
the
guests
as
by
the
splendor
of
their
toilettes
consciousness
of
the
performance
weighs
upon
the
family
party
and
every

significant
francoise
was
on
exhibition
mme
de
senonches
had
sported
her
most
elaborate
costume
for
the
occasion
du
hautoy
wore
a
black
coat
de
senonches
had
returned
from
his
visit
to
the
pimentels
on
the
receipt
of
a
note
from
his
wife
informing
him
that
mme
du
chatelet
was
to
appear
at
their
house
for
the
first
time
since
her
arrival
and
that
a
suitor
in
form
for
francoise
would
appear
on
the
scenes
boniface
cointet
also
was
there
in
his
best
maroon
coat
of
clerical
cut
with
a
diamond
pin
worth
six
thousand
francs
displayed
in
his
shirt
frill
the
revenge
of
the
rich
merchant
upon
a
aristocracy
himself
scoured
and
combed
had
carefully
removed
his
gray
hairs
but
he
could
not
rid
himself
of
his
wizened
air
the
puny
little
man
of
law
tightly
buttoned
into
his
clothes
reminded
you
of
a
torpid
viper
for
if
hope
had
brought
a
spark
of
life
into
his
magpie
eyes
his
face
was
icily
rigid
and
so
well
did
he
assume
an
air
of
gravity
that
an
ambitious
public
prosecutor
could
not
have
been
more
dignified
mme
de
senonches
had
told
her
intimate
friends
that
her
ward
would
meet
her
betrothed
that
evening
and
that
mme
du
chatelet
would
appear
at
the
hotel
de
senonches
for
the
first
time
and
having
particularly
requested
them
to
keep
these
matters
secret
she
expected
to
find
her
rooms
crowded
the
comte
and
comtesse
du
chatelet
had
left
cards
everywhere
officially
but
they
meant
the
honor
of
a
personal
visit
to
play
a
part
in
their
policy
so
aristocratic
angouleme
was
in
such
a
prodigious
ferment
of
curiosity
that
certain
of
the
chandour
camp
proposed
to
go
to
the
hotel
de
bargeton
that
evening
they
persistently
declined
to
call
the
house
by
its
new
name
proofs
of
the
countess
influence
had
stirred
up
ambition
in
many
quarters
and
not
only
so
it
was
said
that
the
lady
had
changed
so
much
for
the
better
that
everybody
wished
to
see
and
judge
for
himself
learned
great
news
on
the
way
to
the
house
cointet
told
him
that
zephirine
had
asked
leave
to
present
her
dear
francoise
betrothed
to
the
countess
and
that
the
countess
had
granted
the
favor
had
seen
at
once
that
lucien
return
put
louise
de
negrepelisse
in
a
false
position
and
now
in
a
moment
he
flattered
himself
that
he
saw
a
way
to
take
advantage
of
it
and
mme
de
senonches
had
undertaken
such
heavy
engagements
when
they
bought
the
house
that
in
provincial
fashion
they
thought
it
imprudent
to
make
any
changes
in
it
so
when
madame
du
chatelet
was
announced
zephirine
went
up
to
her
with
look
dear
louise
you
are
still
in
your
old
home
indicating
as
she
spoke
the
little
chandelier
the
paneled
wainscot
and
the
furniture
which
once
had
dazzled
lucien
i
wish
least
of
all
to
remember
it
dear
madame
la
prefete
answered
graciously
looking
round
on
the
assemblage
every
one
admitted
that
louise
de
negrepelisse
was
not
like
the
same
woman
if
the
provincial
had
undergone
a
change
the
woman
herself
had
been
transformed
by
those
eighteen
months
in
paris
by
the
first
happiness
of
a
still
recent
second
marriage
and
the
kind
of
dignity
that
power
confers
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
bore
the
same
resemblance
to
mme
de
bargeton
that
a
girl
of
twenty
bears
to
her
mother
she
wore
a
charming
cap
of
lace
and
flowers
fastened
by
a
pin
the
ringlets
that
half
hid
the
contours
of
her
face
added
to
her
look
of
youth
and
suited
her
style
of
beauty
her
foulard
gown
designed
by
the
celebrated
victorine
with
a
pointed
bodice
exquisitely
fringed
set
off
her
figure
to
advantage
and
a
silken
lace
scarf
adroitly
thrown
about
a
too
long
neck
partly
concealed
her
shoulders
she
played
with
the
dainty
hung
by
a
chain
from
her
bracelet
she
carried
her
fan
and
her
handkerchief
with
ease
pretty
trifles
as
dangerous
as
a
sunken
reef
for
the
provincial
dame
the
refined
taste
shown
in
the
least
details
the
carriage
and
manner
modeled
upon
mme
revealed
a
profound
study
of
the
faubourg
as
for
the
elderly
beau
of
the
empire
he
seemed
since
his
marriage
to
have
followed
the
example
of
the
species
of
melon
that
turns
from
green
to
yellow
in
a
night
all
the
youth
that
sixte
had
lost
seemed
to
appear
in
his
wife
radiant
countenance
provincial
pleasantries
passed
from
ear
to
ear
circulating
the
more
readily
because
the
women
were
furious
at
the
new
superiority
of
the
sometime
queen
of
angouleme
and
the
persistent
intruder
paid
the
penalty
of
his
offence
the
rooms
were
almost
as
full
as
on
that
memorable
evening
of
readings
from
chenier
some
faces
were
missing
de
chandour
and
amelie
de
pimental
and
the
rastignacs
and
de
bargeton
was
no
longer
there
but
the
bishop
came
as
before
with
his
in
his
train
was
much
impressed
by
the
sight
of
the
great
world
of
angouleme
four
months
ago
he
had
no
hope
of
entering
the
circle
he
felt
his
detestation
of
the
classes
sensibly
diminished
he
thought
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
a
most
fascinating
woman
it
is
she
who
can
procure
me
the
appointment
of
deputy
public
prosecutor
he
said
to
himself
louise
chatted
for
an
equal
length
of
time
with
each
of
the
women
her
tone
varied
with
the
importance
of
the
person
addressed
and
the
position
taken
up
by
the
latter
with
regard
to
her
journey
to
paris
with
lucien
the
evening
was
half
over
when
she
withdrew
to
the
boudoir
with
the
bishop
zephirine
came
over
to
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
his
heart
beat
fast
as
his
hostess
brought
him
to
the
room
where
lucien
troubles
first
began
and
were
now
about
to
come
to
a
crisis
this
is
dear
i
recommend
him
to
you
the
more
warmly
because
anything
that
you
may
do
for
him
will
doubtless
benefit
my
ward
you
are
an
attorney
are
you
not
monsieur
said
the
august
negrepelisse
scanning
alas
yes
la
the
son
of
the
tailor
in
had
never
once
had
occasion
to
use
those
three
words
in
his
life
before
and
his
mouth
was
full
of
them
but
it
rests
with
you
madame
la
comtesse
whether
or
no
i
shall
act
for
the
crown
milaud
is
going
to
nevers
it
is
said
but
a
man
is
usually
second
deputy
and
then
first
deputy
is
he
not
broke
in
the
countess
i
should
like
to
see
you
in
the
first
place
at
once
but
i
should
like
first
to
have
some
assurance
of
your
devotion
to
the
cause
of
our
legitimate
sovereigns
to
religion
and
more
especially
to
de
villele
if
i
am
to
interest
myself
on
your
behalf
to
obtain
the
favor
came
nearer
madame
he
said
in
her
ear
i
am
the
man
to
yield
the
king
absolute
obedience
that
is
just
what
want
said
the
countess
drawing
back
a
little
to
make
him
understand
that
she
had
no
wish
for
promises
given
under
his
breath
so
long
as
you
satisfy
mme
de
senonches
you
can
count
upon
me
she
added
with
a
royal
movement
of
her
fan
looked
toward
the
door
of
the
boudoir
and
saw
cointet
standing
there
madame
he
said
lucien
is
here
in
angouleme
well
sir
asked
the
countess
in
tones
that
would
have
put
an
end
to
all
power
of
speech
in
an
ordinary
man
mme
la
comtesse
does
not
understand
returned
bringing
out
that
most
respectful
formula
again
how
does
mme
la
comtesse
wish
that
the
great
man
of
her
making
should
be
received
in
angouleme
there
is
no
middle
course
he
must
be
received
or
despised
here
this
was
a
dilemma
to
which
louise
de
negrepelisse
had
never
given
a
thought
it
touched
her
closely
yet
rather
for
the
sake
of
the
past
than
of
the
future
and
as
for
his
plan
for
arresting
david
sechard
depended
upon
the
lady
actual
feelings
towards
lucien
he
waited
said
the
countess
with
haughty
dignity
you
mean
to
be
on
the
side
of
the
government
learn
that
the
first
principle
of
government
is
this
never
to
have
been
in
the
wrong
and
that
the
instinct
of
power
and
the
sense
of
dignity
is
even
stronger
in
women
than
in
governments
that
is
just
what
i
thought
madame
he
answered
quickly
observing
the
countess
meanwhile
with
attention
the
more
profound
because
it
was
scarcely
visible
lucien
came
here
in
the
depths
of
misery
but
if
he
must
receive
an
ovation
i
can
compel
him
to
leave
angouleme
by
the
means
of
the
ovation
itself
his
sister
and
david
sechard
are
hard
pressed
for
debts
in
the
countess
haughty
face
there
was
a
swift
barely
perceptible
change
it
was
not
satisfaction
but
the
repression
of
satisfaction
surprised
that
should
have
guessed
her
wishes
she
gave
him
a
glance
as
she
opened
her
fan
and
francoise
de
la
entrance
at
that
moment
gave
her
time
to
find
an
answer
it
will
not
be
long
before
you
are
public
prosecutor
monsieur
she
said
with
a
significant
smile
that
speech
did
not
commit
her
in
any
way
but
it
was
explicit
enough
francoise
had
come
in
to
thank
the
countess
oh
madame
then
i
shall
owe
the
happiness
of
my
life
to
you
she
exclaimed
bending
girlishly
to
add
in
the
countess
ear
to
marry
a
petty
provincial
attorney
would
be
like
being
burned
by
slow
fires
it
was
francis
with
his
knowledge
of
officialdom
who
had
prompted
zephirine
to
make
this
set
upon
louise
in
the
very
earliest
days
after
promotion
so
the
told
his
fair
friend
everybody
prefect
or
monarch
or
man
of
business
is
burning
to
exert
his
influence
for
his
friends
but
a
patron
soon
finds
out
the
inconveniences
of
patronage
and
then
turns
from
fire
to
ice
louise
will
do
more
now
for
than
she
would
do
for
her
husband
in
three
months
time
madame
la
comtesse
is
thinking
of
all
that
our
poet
triumph
entails
continued
she
should
receive
lucien
before
there
is
an
end
of
the
wonder
the
countess
terminated
the
audience
with
a
bow
and
rose
to
speak
with
mme
de
pimentel
who
came
to
the
boudoir
the
news
of
old
negrepelisse
elevation
to
a
marquisate
had
greatly
impressed
the
marquise
she
judged
it
expedient
to
be
amiable
to
a
woman
so
clever
as
to
rise
the
higher
for
an
apparent
fall
do
tell
me
dear
why
you
took
the
trouble
to
put
your
father
in
the
house
of
peers
said
the
marquise
in
the
course
of
a
little
confidential
conversation
in
which
she
bent
the
knee
before
the
superiority
of
her
dear
louise
they
were
all
the
more
ready
to
grant
the
favor
because
my
father
has
no
son
to
succeed
him
dear
and
his
vote
will
always
be
at
the
disposal
of
the
crown
but
if
we
should
have
sons
i
quite
expect
that
my
oldest
will
succeed
to
his
grandfather
name
title
and
peerage
mme
de
pimentel
saw
to
her
annoyance
that
it
was
idle
to
expect
a
mother
ambitious
for
children
not
yet
in
existence
to
further
her
own
private
designs
of
raising
de
pimentel
to
a
peerage
i
have
the
countess
told
cointet
when
they
came
away
i
can
promise
you
your
partnership
i
shall
be
deputy
prosecutor
before
the
month
is
out
and
sechard
will
be
in
your
power
try
to
find
a
buyer
for
my
connection
it
has
come
to
be
the
first
in
angouleme
in
my
hands
during
the
last
five
months
once
put
on
the
horse
and
there
is
no
need
to
do
more
said
cointet
half
jealous
of
his
own
work
the
causes
of
lucien
triumphant
reception
in
his
native
town
must
now
be
plain
to
everybody
louise
du
chatelet
followed
the
example
of
that
king
of
france
who
left
the
duke
of
orleans
unavenged
she
chose
to
forget
the
insults
received
in
paris
by
mme
de
bargeton
she
would
patronize
lucien
and
overwhelming
him
with
her
patronage
would
completely
crush
him
and
get
rid
of
him
by
fair
means
knew
the
whole
tale
of
the
cabals
in
paris
through
town
gossip
and
shrewdly
guessed
how
a
woman
must
hate
the
man
who
would
not
love
when
she
was
fain
of
his
love
the
ovation
justified
the
past
of
louise
de
negrepelisse
the
next
day
appeared
at
mme
sechard
house
heading
a
deputation
of
six
young
men
of
the
town
all
of
them
lucien
schoolfellows
he
meant
to
finish
his
work
to
intoxicate
lucien
completely
and
to
have
him
in
his
power
lucien
old
schoolfellows
at
the
angouleme
wished
to
invite
the
author
of
the
and
archer
of
charles
to
a
banquet
given
in
honor
of
the
great
man
arisen
from
their
ranks
come
this
is
your
doing
exclaimed
lucien
your
return
has
stirred
our
conceit
said
we
made
it
a
point
of
honor
to
get
up
a
subscription
and
we
will
have
a
tremendous
affair
for
you
the
masters
and
the
headmaster
will
be
there
and
at
the
present
rate
we
shall
no
doubt
have
the
authorities
too
for
what
day
asked
lucien
sunday
next
that
is
quite
out
of
the
question
said
lucien
i
can
not
accept
an
invitation
for
the
next
ten
days
but
then
i
will
gladly
very
well
said
so
be
it
then
in
ten
days
time
lucien
behaved
charmingly
to
his
old
schoolfellows
and
they
regarded
him
with
almost
respectful
admiration
he
talked
away
very
wittily
for
half
an
hour
he
had
been
set
upon
a
pedestal
and
wished
to
justify
the
opinion
of
his
so
he
stood
with
his
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
and
held
forth
from
the
height
to
which
he
had
been
raised
he
was
modest
and
as
befitted
genius
in
and
slippers
he
was
the
athlete
wearied
by
a
wrestling
bout
with
paris
and
disenchanted
above
all
things
he
congratulated
the
comrades
who
had
never
left
the
dear
old
province
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
they
were
delighted
with
him
he
took
aside
and
asked
him
for
the
real
truth
about
david
affairs
reproaching
him
for
allowing
his
to
go
into
hiding
and
tried
to
match
his
wits
against
the
little
lawyer
made
an
effort
over
himself
and
gave
his
acquaintance
to
understand
that
he
was
only
an
insignificant
little
country
attorney
with
no
sort
of
craft
nor
subtlety
the
whole
machinery
of
modern
society
is
so
infinitely
more
complex
than
in
ancient
times
that
the
subdivision
of
human
faculty
is
the
result
the
great
men
of
the
days
of
old
were
perforce
universal
geniuses
appearing
at
rare
intervals
like
lighted
torches
in
an
antique
world
in
the
course
of
ages
the
intellect
began
to
work
on
special
lines
but
the
great
man
still
could
take
all
knowledge
for
his
province
a
man
full
cautelous
as
was
said
of
louis
for
instance
could
apply
that
special
faculty
in
every
direction
but
the
single
quality
is
subdivided
and
every
profession
has
its
special
craft
a
peasant
or
a
pettifogging
solicitor
might
very
easily
overreach
an
astute
diplomate
over
a
bargain
in
some
remote
country
village
and
the
wiliest
journalist
may
prove
the
veriest
simpleton
in
a
piece
of
business
lucien
could
but
be
a
puppet
in
the
hands
of
that
guileful
practitioner
as
might
have
been
expected
had
written
the
article
himself
angouleme
and
thus
put
on
their
mettle
thought
it
incumbent
upon
them
to
pay
honor
to
lucien
his
assembled
in
the
place
du
murier
were
workpeople
from
the
papermills
and
with
a
sprinkling
of
lucien
old
schoolfellows
and
the
clerks
in
the
employ
of
messieurs
and
cachan
as
for
the
attorney
himself
he
was
once
more
lucien
chum
of
old
days
and
he
thought
not
without
reason
that
before
very
long
he
should
learn
david
whereabouts
in
some
unguarded
moment
and
if
david
came
to
grief
through
fault
the
poet
would
find
angouleme
too
hot
to
hold
him
meant
to
secure
his
hold
he
posed
therefore
as
lucien
inferior
what
better
could
i
have
done
he
said
accordingly
my
old
sister
was
involved
it
is
true
but
there
are
some
positions
that
simply
can
not
be
maintained
in
a
court
of
law
david
asked
me
on
the
first
of
june
to
ensure
him
a
quiet
life
for
three
months
he
had
a
quiet
life
until
september
and
even
so
i
have
kept
his
property
out
of
his
creditors
power
for
i
shall
gain
my
case
in
the
i
contend
that
the
wife
is
a
privileged
creditor
and
her
claim
is
absolute
unless
there
is
evidence
of
intent
to
defraud
as
for
you
you
have
come
back
in
misfortune
but
you
are
a
genius
lucien
turned
about
as
if
the
incense
were
burned
too
close
to
his
face
yes
my
dear
fellow
a
i
have
read
your
of
charles
it
is
more
than
a
romance
it
is
literature
only
two
living
men
could
have
written
the
preface
chateaubriand
and
lucien
lucien
accepted
that
had
written
the
preface
writers
out
of
a
hundred
would
have
done
the
same
well
nobody
here
seemed
to
have
heard
of
you
continued
with
apparent
indignation
when
i
saw
the
general
indifference
i
made
up
my
mind
to
change
all
that
i
wrote
that
article
in
the
paper
what
did
you
write
it
exclaimed
lucien
i
myself
angouleme
and
were
stirred
to
rivalry
i
arranged
for
a
meeting
of
your
old
schoolfellows
and
got
up
serenade
and
when
once
the
enthusiasm
began
to
grow
we
started
a
committee
for
the
dinner
david
is
in
hiding
said
i
to
myself
shall
be
crowned
at
any
rate
and
i
have
done
even
better
than
that
continued
i
have
seen
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
and
made
her
understand
that
she
owes
it
to
herself
to
extricate
david
from
his
position
she
can
do
it
and
she
ought
to
do
it
if
david
had
really
discovered
the
secret
of
which
he
spoke
to
me
the
government
ought
to
lend
him
a
hand
it
would
not
ruin
the
government
and
think
what
a
fine
thing
for
a
prefect
to
have
half
the
credit
of
the
great
invention
for
the
help
it
would
set
people
talking
about
him
as
an
enlightened
your
sister
has
taken
fright
at
our
musketry
practice
she
was
scared
of
the
smoke
a
battle
in
the
costs
quite
as
much
as
a
battle
on
the
field
but
david
has
held
his
ground
he
has
his
secret
they
can
not
stop
him
and
they
will
not
pull
him
up
now
thanks
my
dear
fellow
i
see
that
i
can
take
you
into
my
confidence
you
shall
help
me
to
carry
out
my
plan
looked
at
lucien
and
his
gimlet
face
was
a
point
of
interrogation
i
intend
to
rescue
sechard
lucien
said
with
a
certain
importance
i
brought
his
misfortunes
upon
him
i
mean
to
make
full
reparation
i
have
more
influence
over
louise
who
is
louise
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
started
i
have
more
influence
over
her
than
she
herself
suspects
said
lucien
only
my
dear
fellow
if
i
can
do
something
with
your
authorities
here
i
have
no
decent
clothes
made
as
though
he
would
offer
his
purse
thank
you
said
lucien
grasping
hand
in
ten
time
i
will
pay
a
visit
to
the
countess
and
return
your
call
the
shook
hands
like
old
comrades
and
separated
he
ought
to
be
a
poet
said
to
himself
he
is
quite
mad
there
are
no
friends
like
one
school
friends
it
is
a
true
saying
lucien
thought
at
he
went
to
find
his
sister
what
can
have
promised
to
do
that
you
should
be
so
friendly
with
him
my
lucien
asked
eve
be
on
your
guard
with
him
with
cried
lucien
listen
eve
he
continued
seeming
to
bethink
himself
you
have
no
faith
in
me
now
you
do
not
trust
me
so
it
is
not
likely
you
will
trust
but
in
ten
or
twelve
days
you
will
change
your
mind
he
added
with
a
touch
of
fatuity
and
he
went
to
his
room
and
indited
the
following
epistle
to
lousteau
to
my
friend
of
the
pair
of
us
i
alone
can
remember
that
bill
for
a
thousand
francs
that
i
once
lent
you
and
i
know
how
things
will
be
with
you
when
you
open
this
letter
too
well
alas
not
to
add
immediately
that
i
do
not
expect
to
be
repaid
in
current
coin
of
the
realm
no
i
will
take
it
in
credit
from
you
just
as
one
would
ask
florine
for
pleasure
we
have
the
same
tailor
therefore
you
can
order
a
complete
outfit
for
me
on
the
shortest
possible
notice
i
am
not
precisely
wearing
adam
costume
but
i
can
not
show
myself
here
to
my
astonishment
the
honors
paid
by
the
departments
to
a
parisian
celebrity
awaited
me
i
am
the
hero
of
a
banquet
for
all
the
world
as
if
i
were
a
deputy
of
the
left
now
after
that
do
you
understand
that
i
must
have
a
black
coat
promise
to
pay
have
it
put
down
to
your
account
try
the
advertisement
dodge
rehearse
an
unpublished
scene
between
don
juan
and
dimanche
for
i
must
have
a
gala
suit
at
all
costs
i
have
nothing
nothing
but
rags
start
with
that
it
is
august
the
weather
is
magnificent
ergo
see
that
i
receive
by
the
end
of
the
week
a
charming
morning
suit
dark
jacket
and
three
waistcoats
one
a
brimstone
yellow
one
a
plaid
and
the
third
must
be
white
furthermore
let
there
be
three
pairs
of
trousers
of
the
most
fetching
kind
one
pair
of
white
english
stuff
one
pair
of
nankeen
and
a
third
of
thin
black
kerseymere
lastly
send
a
black
and
a
black
satin
waistcoat
if
you
have
picked
up
another
florine
somewhere
i
beg
her
good
offices
for
two
cravats
so
far
this
is
nothing
i
count
upon
you
and
your
skill
in
these
matters
i
am
not
much
afraid
of
the
tailor
but
the
ingenuity
of
poverty
assuredly
the
most
active
of
all
poisons
at
work
in
the
system
of
man
the
parisian
an
ingenuity
that
would
catch
satan
himself
napping
has
failed
so
far
to
discover
a
way
to
obtain
a
hat
on
credit
how
many
a
time
my
dear
friend
have
we
deplored
this
when
one
of
us
shall
bring
a
hat
that
costs
one
thousand
francs
into
fashion
then
and
not
till
then
can
we
afford
to
wear
them
until
that
day
comes
we
are
bound
to
have
cash
enough
in
our
pockets
to
pay
for
a
hat
ah
what
an
ill
turn
the
did
us
with
you
will
put
gold
in
my
pockets
i
write
with
a
profound
sense
of
all
the
difficulties
involved
by
the
demand
enclose
with
the
above
a
pair
of
boots
a
pair
of
pumps
a
hat
half
a
dozen
pairs
of
gloves
is
asking
the
impossible
i
know
it
but
what
is
a
literary
life
but
a
periodical
recurrence
of
the
impossible
work
the
miracle
write
a
long
article
or
play
some
small
scurvy
trick
and
i
will
hold
your
debt
as
fully
discharged
this
is
all
i
say
to
you
it
is
a
debt
of
honor
after
all
my
dear
fellow
and
due
these
twelve
months
you
ought
to
blush
for
yourself
if
you
have
any
blushes
left
joking
apart
my
dear
lousteau
i
am
in
serious
difficulties
as
you
may
judge
for
yourself
when
i
tell
you
that
mme
de
bargeton
has
married
chatelet
and
chatelet
is
prefect
of
angouleme
the
precious
pair
can
do
a
good
deal
for
my
he
is
in
hiding
at
this
moment
on
account
of
that
letter
of
exchange
and
the
horrid
business
is
all
my
doing
so
it
is
a
question
of
appearing
before
mme
la
prefete
and
regaining
my
influence
at
all
costs
it
is
shocking
is
it
not
that
david
sechard
fate
should
hang
upon
a
neat
pair
of
shoes
a
pair
of
gray
silk
stockings
mind
you
remember
them
and
a
new
hat
i
shall
give
out
that
i
am
sick
and
ill
and
take
to
my
bed
like
duvicquet
to
save
the
trouble
of
replying
to
the
pressing
invitations
of
my
my
dear
boy
have
treated
me
to
a
fine
serenade
forsooth
i
begin
to
wonder
how
many
fools
go
to
make
up
that
word
since
i
learned
that
two
or
three
of
my
old
schoolfellows
worked
up
the
capital
of
the
angoumois
to
this
pitch
of
enthusiasm
if
you
could
contrive
to
slip
a
few
lines
as
to
my
reception
in
among
the
news
items
i
should
be
several
inches
taller
for
it
here
and
besides
i
should
make
mme
la
prefete
feel
that
if
i
have
not
friends
i
have
some
credit
at
any
rate
with
the
parisian
press
i
give
up
none
of
my
hopes
and
i
will
return
the
compliment
if
you
want
a
good
solid
substantial
article
for
some
magazine
or
other
i
have
time
enough
now
to
think
something
out
i
only
say
the
word
my
dear
friend
i
count
upon
you
as
you
may
count
upon
me
and
i
am
yours
sincerely
lucien
de
send
the
things
to
the
coach
office
to
wait
until
called
for
lucien
held
up
his
head
again
in
this
mood
he
wrote
the
letter
and
as
he
wrote
his
thoughts
went
back
to
paris
he
had
spent
six
days
in
the
provinces
and
the
uneventful
quietness
of
provincial
life
had
already
entered
into
his
soul
his
mind
returned
to
those
dear
old
miserable
days
with
a
vague
sense
of
regret
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
filled
his
thoughts
for
a
whole
week
and
at
last
he
came
to
attach
so
much
importance
to
his
reappearance
that
he
hurried
down
to
the
coach
office
in
after
nightfall
in
a
perfect
agony
of
suspense
like
a
woman
who
has
set
her
last
hopes
upon
a
new
dress
and
waits
in
despair
until
it
arrives
ah
lousteau
all
your
treasons
are
forgiven
he
said
to
himself
as
he
eyed
the
packages
and
knew
from
the
shape
of
them
that
everything
had
been
sent
inside
the
hatbox
he
found
a
note
from
lousteau
florine
my
dear
boy
the
tailor
behaved
very
well
but
as
thy
profound
retrospective
glance
led
thee
to
forbode
the
cravats
the
hats
and
the
silk
hosen
perplexed
our
souls
for
there
was
nothing
in
our
purse
to
be
perplexed
thereby
as
said
blondet
so
say
we
there
is
a
fortune
awaiting
the
establishment
which
will
supply
young
men
with
inexpensive
articles
on
credit
for
when
we
do
not
pay
in
the
beginning
we
pay
dear
in
the
end
and
by
the
by
did
not
the
great
napoleon
who
missed
a
voyage
to
the
indies
for
want
of
boots
say
that
a
thing
is
easy
it
is
never
done
so
everything
went
well
except
the
boots
i
beheld
a
vision
of
thee
fully
dressed
but
without
a
hat
appareled
in
waistcoats
yet
shoeless
and
bethought
me
of
sending
a
pair
of
moccasins
given
to
florine
as
a
curiosity
by
an
american
florine
offered
the
huge
sum
of
forty
francs
that
we
might
try
our
luck
at
play
for
you
nathan
blondet
and
i
had
such
luck
as
we
were
not
playing
for
ourselves
that
we
were
rich
enough
to
ask
la
torpille
des
lupeaulx
sometime
to
supper
frascati
certainly
owed
us
that
much
florine
undertook
the
shopping
and
added
three
fine
shirts
to
the
purchases
nathan
sends
you
a
cane
blondet
who
won
three
hundred
francs
is
sending
you
a
gold
chain
and
the
gold
watch
the
size
of
a
piece
is
from
la
torpille
some
idiot
gave
the
thing
to
her
and
it
will
not
go
rubbish
she
says
the
man
that
owned
it
bixiou
who
came
to
find
us
up
at
the
de
wished
to
enclose
a
bottle
of
portugal
water
in
the
package
said
our
first
comic
man
this
can
make
him
happy
let
him
have
it
growling
it
out
in
a
deep
bass
voice
with
the
pomposity
that
he
can
act
to
the
life
which
things
my
dear
boy
ought
to
prove
to
you
how
much
we
care
for
our
friends
in
adversity
florine
whom
i
have
had
the
weakness
to
forgive
begs
you
to
send
us
an
article
on
nathan
hat
fare
thee
well
my
son
i
can
only
commiserate
you
on
finding
yourself
back
in
the
same
box
from
which
you
emerged
when
you
discovered
your
old
comrade
etienne
poor
fellows
they
have
been
gambling
for
me
said
lucien
he
was
quite
touched
by
the
letter
a
waft
of
the
breeze
from
an
unhealthy
country
from
the
land
where
one
has
suffered
most
may
seem
to
bring
the
odors
of
paradise
and
in
a
dull
life
there
is
an
indefinable
sweetness
in
memories
of
past
pain
eve
was
struck
dumb
with
amazement
when
her
brother
came
down
in
his
new
clothes
she
did
not
recognize
him
now
i
can
walk
out
in
beaulieu
he
cried
they
shall
not
say
it
of
me
that
i
came
back
in
rags
look
here
is
a
watch
which
i
shall
return
to
you
for
it
is
mine
and
like
its
owner
it
is
erratic
in
its
ways
what
a
child
he
is
exclaimed
eve
it
is
impossible
to
bear
you
any
grudge
then
do
you
imagine
my
dear
girl
that
i
sent
for
all
this
with
the
silly
idea
of
shining
in
angouleme
i
do
care
for
angouleme
twirling
his
cane
with
the
engraved
gold
knob
i
intend
to
repair
the
wrong
i
have
done
and
this
is
my
battle
array
lucien
success
in
this
kind
was
his
one
real
triumph
but
the
triumph
be
it
said
was
immense
if
admiration
freezes
some
tongues
envy
loosens
at
least
as
many
more
and
if
women
lost
their
heads
over
lucien
men
slandered
him
he
might
have
cried
in
the
words
of
the
songwriter
i
thank
thee
my
coat
he
left
two
cards
at
the
prefecture
and
another
upon
the
next
day
the
day
of
the
banquet
the
following
paragraph
appeared
under
the
heading
angouleme
in
the
paris
newspapers
angouleme
the
return
of
the
author
of
archer
of
charles
has
been
the
signal
for
an
ovation
which
does
equal
honor
to
the
town
and
to
lucien
de
rubempre
the
young
poet
who
has
made
so
brilliant
a
beginning
the
writer
of
the
one
french
historical
novel
not
written
in
the
style
of
scott
and
of
a
preface
which
may
be
called
a
literary
event
the
town
hastened
to

melody
which
has
never
found
popular
favor
it
was
then
five
in
the
evening
it
was
eight
before
dessert
was
served
conspicuous
among
the
dishes
appeared
an
olympus
in
confectionery
surmounted
by
a
figure
of

modeled
in

to
give
the
signal
for
toasts
and

gentlemen
called
the
prefect
rising
to
his
feet
the
king
the
rightful
ruler
of
france
to
what
do
we
owe
the
generation
of
poets
and
thinkers
who
maintain

sceptre
of

in

restored

cried
the
assembled
guests
ministerialists
predominated
the
venerable
headmaster
rose
to
the
hero
of
the
day
he
said
to
the
young
poet
who
combines
the
gift
of
the
with
the
charm
and
poetic
faculty
of
petrarch
in
that
which
boileau
declares
to
be
so
difficult

the
colonel
rose
next
gentlemen
to
the
royalist
for
the
hero
of
this
evening
had
the
courage
to
fight
for
sound
principles
bravo
cried
the
prefect
leading
the
applause
then
called
upon
all
lucien
schoolfellows
there
present
to
the
pride
of
the
of
angouleme
to
the
venerable
headmaster
so
dear
to
us
all
to
whom
the
acknowledgment
for
some
part
of
our
triumph
is
due
the
old
headmaster
dried
his
eyes
he
had
not
expected
this
toast
lucien
rose
to
his
feet
the
whole
room
was
suddenly
silent
and
the
poet
face
grew
white
in
that
pause
the
old
headmaster
who
sat
on
his
left
crowned
him
with
a
laurel
wreath
a
round
of
applause
followed
and
when
lucien
spoke
it
was
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
a
sob
in
his
throat
he
is
drunk
remarked
the
to
his
neighbor
my
dear
my
dear
comrades
lucien
said
at
last
i
could
wish
that
all
france
might
witness
this
scene
for
thus
men
rise
to
their
full
stature
and
in
such
ways
as
these
our
land
demands
great
deeds
and
noble
work
of
us
and
when
i
think
of
the
little
that
i
have
done
and
of
this
great
honor
shown
to
me
i
can
only
feel
confused
and
impose
upon
the
future
the
task
of
justifying
your
reception
of
me
the
recollection
of
this
moment
will
give
me
renewed
strength
for
efforts
to
come
permit
me
to
indicate
for
your
homage
my
earliest
muse
and
protectress
and
to
associate
her
name
with
that
of
my
birthplace
so
to
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
and
the
noble
town
of
angouleme
he
came
out
of
that
pretty
well
said
the
public
prosecutor
nodding
approval
our
speeches
were
all
prepared
and
his
was
improvised
at
ten
the
party
began
to
break
up
and
little
knots
of
guests
went
home
together
david
sechard
heard
the
unwonted
music
what
is
going
on
in
he
asked
of
basine
they
are
giving
a
dinner
to
your
lucien
i
know
that
he
would
feel
sorry
to
miss
me
there
he
said
at
midnight
walked
home
with
lucien
as
they
reached
the
place
du
murier
lucien
said
come
life
come
death
we
are
friends
my
dear
fellow
my
marriage
contract
said
the
lawyer
with
mlle
francoise
de
la
haye
will
be
signed
at
mme
de
senonches
house
do
me
the
pleasure
of
coming
mme
de
senonches
implored
me
to
bring
you
and
you
will
meet
mme
du
chatelet
they
are
sure
to
tell
her
of
your
speech
and
she
will
feel
flattered
by
it
i
knew
what
i
was
about
said
lucien
oh
you
will
save
david
i
am
sure
i
shall
the
poet
replied
just
at
that
moment
david
appeared
as
if
by
magic
in
the
place
du
murier
this
was
how
it
had
come
about
he
felt
that
he
was
in
a
rather
difficult
position
his
wife
insisted
that
lucien
must
neither
go
to
david
nor
know
of
his
and
lucien
all
the
while
was
writing
the
most
affectionate
letters
saying
that
in
a
few
days
time
all
should
be
set
right
and
even
as
basine
clerget
explained
the
reason
why
the
band
played
she
put
two
letters
into
his
hands
the
first
was
from
eve
dearest
she
wrote
do
as
if
lucien
were
not
here
do
not
trouble
yourself
in
the
least
our
whole
security
depends
upon
the
fact
that
your
enemies
can
not
find
you
get
that
idea
firmly
into
your
head
i
have
more
confidence
in
kolb
and
marion
and
basine
than
in
my
own
brother
such
is
my
misfortune
alas
poor
lucien
is
not
the
ingenuous
and
poet
whom
we
used
to
know
and
it
is
simply
because
he
is
trying
to
interfere
on
your
behalf
and
because
he
imagines
that
he
can
discharge
our
debts
and
this
from
pride
my
david
that
i
am
afraid
of
him
some
fine
clothes
have
been
sent
from
paris
for
him
and
five
gold
pieces
in
a
pretty
purse
he
gave
the
money
to
me
and
we
are
living
on
it
we
have
one
enemy
the
less
your
father
has
gone
thanks
to
unraveled
his
designs
and
put
an
end
to
them
at
once
by
telling
him
that
you
would
do
nothing
without
consulting
him
and
that
he
would
not
allow
you
to
concede
a
single
point
in
the
matter
of
the
invention
until
you
had
been
promised
an
indemnity
of
thirty
thousand
francs
fifteen
thousand
to
free
you
from
embarrassment
and
fifteen
thousand
more
to
be
yours
in
any
case
whether
your
invention
succeeds
or
no
i
can
not
understand
i
embrace
you
dear
a
wife
kiss
for
her
husband
in
trouble
our
little
lucien
is
well
how
strange
it
is
to
watch
him
grow
rosy
and
strong
like
a
flower
in
these
stormy
days
mother
prays
god
for
you
now
as
always
and
sends
love
only
less
tender
than
your
eve
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
the
cointets
had
taken
fright
at
old
sechard
peasant
shrewdness
and
got
rid
of
him
so
much
the
more
easily
because
it
was
now
vintage
time
at
marsac
eve
letter
enclosed
another
from
lucien
my
dear
david
everything
is
going
well
i
am
armed
i
open
the
campaign
and
in
hours
i
shall
have
made
great
progress
how
glad
i
shall
be
to
embrace
you
when
you
are
free
again
and
my
debts
are
all
paid
my
mother
and
sister
persist
in
mistrusting
me
their
suspicion
wounds
me
to
the
quick
as
if
i
did
not
know
already
that
you
are
hiding
with
basine
for
every
time
that
basine
comes
to
the
house
i
hear
news
of
you
and
receive
answers
to
my
letters
and
besides
it
is
plain
that
my
sister
could
not
find
any
one
else
to
trust
it
hurts
me
cruelly
to
think
that
i
shall
be
so
near
you
and
yet
that
you
will
not
be
present
at
this
banquet
in
my
honor
i
owe
my
little
triumph
to
the
vainglory
of
angouleme
in
a
few
days
it
will
be
quite
forgotten
and
you
alone
would
have
taken
a
real
pleasure
in
it
but
after
all
in
a
little
while
you
will
pardon
everything
to
one
who
counts
it
more
than
all
the
triumphs
in
the
world
to
be
your
brother
lucien
two
forces
tugged
sharply
at
david
heart
he
adored
his
wife
and
if
he
held
lucien
in
somewhat
less
esteem
his
friendship
was
scarcely
diminished
in
solitude
our
feelings
have
unrestricted
play
and
a
man
preoccupied
like
david
with
thoughts
will
give
way
to
impulses
for
which
ordinary
life
would
have
provided
a
sufficient
counterpoise
as
he
read
lucien
letter
to
the
sound
of
military
music
and
heard
of
this
recognition
he
was
deeply
touched
by
that
expression
of
regret
he
had
known
how
it
would
be
a
very
slight
expression
of
feeling
appeals
irresistibly
to
a
sensitive
soul
for
they
are
apt
to
credit
others
with
like
depths
how
should
the
drop
fall
unless
the
cup
were
full
to
the
brim
so
at
midnight
in
spite
of
all
basine
entreaties
david
must
go
to
see
lucien
nobody
will
be
out
in
the
streets
at
this
time
of
night
he
said
i
shall
not
be
seen
and
they
can
not
arrest
me
even
if
i
should
meet
people
i
can
make
use
of
kolb
way
of
going
into
hiding
and
besides
it
is
so
intolerably
long
since
i
saw
my
wife
and
child
the
reasoning
was
plausible
enough
basine
gave
way
and
david
went
was
just
taking
leave
as
he
came
up
and
at
his
cry
of
lucien
the
two
brothers
flung
their
arms
about
each
other
with
tears
in
their
eyes
life
holds
not
many
moments
such
as
these
lucien
heart
went
out
in
response
to
this
friendship
for
its
own
sake
there
was
never
question
of
debtor
and
creditor
between
them
and
the
offender
met
with
no
reproaches
save
his
own
david
generous
and
noble
that
he
was
was
longing
to
bestow
pardon
he
meant
first
of
all
to
read
lucien
a
lecture
and
scatter
the
clouds
that
overspread
the
love
of
the
brother
and
sister
and
with
these
ends
in
view
the
lack
of
money
and
its
consequent
dangers
disappeared
entirely
from
his
mind
go
home
said
addressing
his
client
take
advantage
of
your
imprudence
to
see
your
wife
and
child
again
at
any
rate
and
you
must
not
be
seen
mind
you
how
unlucky
he
added
when
he
was
alone
in
the
place
du
murier
if
only
cerizet
were
here
the
buildings
magniloquently
styled
the
angouleme
law
courts
were
then
in
process
of
construction
muttered
these
words
to
himself
as
he
passed
by
the
hoardings
and
heard
a
tap
upon
the
boards
and
a
voice
issuing
from
a
crack
between
two
planks
here
i
am
said
cerizet
i
saw
david
coming
out
of
i
was
beginning
to
have
my
suspicions
about
his
retreat
and
now
i
am
sure
and
i
know
where
to
have
him
but
i
want
to
know
something
of
plans
before
i
set
the
snare
for
david
and
here
are
you
sending
him
into
the
house
find
some
excuse
for
stopping
here
at
least
and
when
david
and
lucien
come
out
send
them
round
this
way
they
will
think
they
are
quite
alone
and
i
shall
overhear
their
you
are
a
very
devil
muttered
well
i
blessed
if
a
man
would
do
anything
for
the
thing
you
promised
me
walked
away
from
the
hoarding
and
paced
up
and
down
in
the
place
du
murier
he
watched
the
windows
of
the
room
where
the
family
sat
together
and
thought
of
his
own
prospects
to
keep
up
his
courage
cerizet
cleverness
had
given
him
the
chance
of
striking
the
final
blow
was
a
of
the
profoundly
cautious
stamp
that
is
never
caught
by
the
bait
of
a
present
satisfaction
nor
entangled
by
a
personal
attachment
after
his
first
initiation
into
the
strategy
of
and
the
instability
of
the
human
heart
so
from
the
very
first
he
had
put
little
trust
in
cointet
he
foresaw
that
his
marriage
negotiations
might
very
easily
be
broken
off
saw
also
that
in
that
case
he
could
not
accuse
cointet
of
bad
faith
and
he
had
taken
his
measures
accordingly
but
since
his
success
at
the
hotel
de
bargeton
game
was
above
board
a
certain
of
his
was
useless
now
and
even
dangerous
to
a
man
with
his
political
ambitions
he
had
laid
the
foundations
of
his
future
importance
in
the
following
manner
gannerac
and
a
few
of
the
wealthy
men
of
business
in
formed
a
sort
of
liberal
clique
in
constant
communication
through
commercial
channels
with
the
leaders
of
the
opposition
the
villele
ministry
accepted
by
the
dying
louis
gave
the
signal
for
a
change
of
tactics
in
the
opposition
camp
for
since
the
death
of
napoleon
the
liberals
had
ceased
to
resort
to
the
dangerous
expedient
of
conspiracy
they
were
busy
organizing
resistance
by
lawful
means
throughout
the
provinces
and
aiming
at
securing
control
of
the
great
bulk
of
electors
by
convincing
the
masses
a
rabid
liberal
and
a
man
of
was
the
instigator
the
secret
counselor
and
the
very
life
of
this
movement
in
the
lower
town
which
groaned
under
the
tyranny
of
the
aristocrats
at
the
upper
end
he
was
the
first
to
see
the
danger
of
leaving
the
whole
press
of
the
department
in
the
control
of
the
cointets
the
opposition
must
have
its
organ
it
would
not
do
to
be
behind
other
cities
if
each
one
of
us
gives
gannerac
a
bill
for
five
hundred
francs
he
would
have
some
twenty
thousand
francs
and
more
we
might
buy
up
sechard
and
we
could
do
as
we
liked
with
the
if
we
lent
him
the
capital
had
said
others
had
taken
up
the
idea
and
in
this
way
strengthened
his
position
with
regard
to
david
on
the
one
side
and
the
cointets
on
the
other
casting
about
him
for
a
tool
for
his
party
he
naturally
thought
that
a
rogue
of
cerizet
calibre
was
the
very
man
for
the
purpose
if
you
can
find
sechard
and
put
him
in
our
hands
somebody
will
lend
you
twenty
thousand
francs
to
buy
his
business
and
very
likely
there
will
be
a
newspaper
to
print
so
set
about
it
he
had
said
put
more
faith
in
cerizet
activity
than
in
all
the
doublons
in
existence
and
then
it
was
that
he
promised
cointet
that
sechard
should
be
arrested
but
now
that
the
little
lawyer
cherished
hopes
of
office
he
saw
that
he
must
turn
his
back
upon
the
liberals
and
meanwhile
the
amount
for
the
had
been
subscribed
in
decided
to
allow
things
to
take
their
natural
course
pooh
he
thought
cerizet
will
get
into
trouble
with
his
paper
and
give
me
an
opportunity
of
displaying
my
talents
he
walked
up
to
the
door
of
the
and
spoke
to
kolb
the
sentinel
go
up
and
warn
david
that
he
had
better
go
now
he
said
and
take
every
precaution
i
am
going
home
it
is
one
marion
came
to
take
kolb
place
lucien
and
david
came
down
together
and
went
out
kolb
a
hundred
paces
ahead
of
them
and
marion
at
the
same
distance
behind
the
two
friends
walked
past
the
hoarding
lucien
talking
eagerly
the
while
my
plan
is
extremely
simple
david
but
how
could
i
tell
you
about
it
while
eve
was
there
she
would
never
understand
i
am
quite
sure
that
at
the
bottom
of
louise
heart
there
is
a
feeling
that
i
can
rouse
and
i
should
like
to
arouse
it
if
it
is
only
to
avenge
myself
upon
that
idiot
the
prefect
if
our
love

thousand

the
little
boudoir
where

old
affair

the
heart

liberty

then

how
it
was
that
i
wanted
clothes
from
paris
one
can
not
act
the
lover
part
in
rags
at
six
that
morning
cerizet

to
doublon

be
ready
to
take
his
man

noon

will
answer
for
it
he
said
i
know
one
of
mlle
clerget
girls
do
you
understand
cerizet
unfolded
his
plan
and
hurried
to
find
cointet
if
francis
du
hautoy
will
settle
his
property
on
francoise
you
shall
sign
a
deed
of
partnership
with
sechard
in
two
days
i
shall
not
be
married
for
a
week
after
the
contract
is
signed
so
we
shall
both
be
within
the
terms
of
our
little
agreement
tit
for
tat
however
we
must
keep
a
close
watch
over
lucien
and
mme
la
comtesse
du
chatelet
for
the
whole
business
lies
in
that
if
lucien
hopes
to
succeed
through
the
countess
influence
i
have
david
safe
you
will
be
keeper
of
the
seals
yet
it
is
my
belief
said
cointet
and
why
not
no
one
objects
to
de
peyronnet
said
he
had
not
altogether
sloughed
his
skin
of
liberalism
mlle
de
la
haye
ambiguous
position
brought
most
of
the
upper
town
to
the
signing
of
the
marriage
contract
the
comparative
poverty
of
the
young
couple
and
the
absence
of
a
quickened
the
interest
that
people
love
to
exhibit
for
it
is
with
beneficence
as
with
ovations
we
prefer
the
deeds
of
charity
which
gratify
the
marquise
de
pimentel
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
de
senonches
and
one
or
two
frequenters
of
the
house
had
given
francoise
a
few
wedding
presents
which
made
great
talk
in
the
city
these
pretty
trifles
together
with
the
trousseau
which
zephirine
had
been
preparing
for
the
past
twelve
months
the
godfather
jewels
and
the
usual
wedding
gifts
consoled
francoise
and
roused
the
curiosity
of
some
mothers
of
daughters
and
cointet
had
both
remarked
that
their
presence
in
the
angouleme
olympus
was
endured
rather
than
courted
cointet
was
francoise
trustee
and
and
if
was
to
sign
the
contract
presence
was
as
necessary
as
the
attendance
of
the
man
to
be
hanged
at
an
execution
but
though
once
married
mme
might
keep
her
right
of
entry
to
her
godmother
house
foresaw
some
difficulty
on
his
own
account
and
resolved
to
be
beforehand
with
these
haughty
personages
he
felt
ashamed
of
his
parents
he
had
sent
his
mother
to
stay
at
mansle
now
he
begged
her
to
say
that
she
was
out
of
health
and
to
give
her
consent
in
writing
so
humiliating
was
it
to
be
without
relations
protectors
or
witnesses
to
his
signature
that
thought
himself
in
luck
that
he
could
bring
a
presentable
friend
at
the
countess
request
he
called
to
take
up
lucien
and
they
drove
to
the
hotel
de
bargeton
on
that
memorable
evening
the
poet
dressed
to
outshine
every
man
present
mme
de
senonches
had
spoken
of
him
as
the
hero
of
the
hour
and
a
first
interview
between
two
estranged
lovers
is
the
kind
of
scene
that
provincials
particularly
love
lucien
had
come
to
be
the
lion
of
the
evening
he
was
said
to
be
so
handsome
so
much
changed
so
wonderful
that
every
woman
in
angouleme
was
curious
to
see
him
again
following
the
fashion
of
the
transition
period
between
the
eighteenth
century
small
clothes
and
the
vulgar
costume
of
the
present
day
he
wore
black
trousers
men
still
showed
their
figures
in
those
days
to
the
utter
despair
of
lean
mortals
and
lucien
was
an
apollo
the
gray
silk
stockings
the
neat
shoes
and
the
black
satin
waistcoat
were
scrupulously
drawn
over
his
person
and
seemed
to
cling
to
him
his
forehead
looked
the
whiter
by
contrast
with
the
thick
bright
curls
that
rose
above
it
with
studied
grace
the
proud
eyes
were
radiant
the
hands
small
as
a
woman
never
showed
to
better
advantage
than
when
gloved
he
had
modeled
himself
upon
de
marsay
the
famous
parisian
dandy
holding
his
hat
and
cane
in
one
hand
and
keeping
the
other
free
for
the
very
occasional
gestures
which
illustrated
his
talk
lucien
had
quite
intended
to
emulate
the
famous
false
modesty
of
those
who
bend
their
heads
to
pass
beneath
the
porte
and
to
slip
unobserved
into
the
room
but
having
but
one
friend
made
him
useful
he
brought
lucien
almost
pompously
through
a
crowded
room
to
mme
de
senonches
the
poet
heard
a
murmur
as
he
passed
not
so
very
long
ago
that
hum
of
voices
would
have
turned
his
head
he
was
quite
different
he
did
not
doubt
that
he
himself
was
greater
than
the
whole
olympus
put
together
madame
he
said
addressing
mme
de
senonches
i
have
already
congratulated
my
friend
a
man
with
the
stuff
in
him
of
which
keepers
of
the
seals
are
made
on
the
honor
of
his
approaching
connection
with
you
slight
as
are
the
ties
between
godmother
and
goddaughter
this
with
the
air
of
a
man
uttering
an
epigram
by
no
means
lost
upon
any
woman
in
the
room
for
every
woman
was
listening
without
appearing
to
do
so
and
as
for
myself
he
continued
i
am
delighted
to
have
the
opportunity
of
paying
my
homage
to
you
he
spoke
easily
and
fluently
as
some
great
lord
might
speak
under
the
roof
of
his
inferiors
and
as
he
listened
to
zephirine
involved
reply
he
cast
a
glance
over
the
room
to
consider
the
effect
that
he
wished
to
make
the
pause
gave
him
time
to
discover
francis
du
hautoy
and
the
prefect
to
bow
gracefully
to
each
with
the
proper
shade
of
difference
in
his
smile
and
finally
to
approach
mme
du
chatelet
as
if
he
had
just
caught
sight
of
her
that
meeting
was
the
real
event
of
the
evening
no
one
so
much
as
thought
of
the
marriage
contract
lying
in
the
adjoining
bedroom
whither
francoise
and
the
notary
led
guest
after
guest
to
sign
the
document
lucien
made
a
step
towards
louise
de
negrepelisse
and
then
spoke
with
that
grace
of
manner
now
associated
for
her
with
memories
of
paris
do
i
owe
to
you
madame
the
pleasure
of
an
invitation
to
dine
at
the
prefecture
the
day
after
he
said
you
owe
it
solely
to
your
fame
monsieur
louise
answered
drily
somewhat
taken
aback
by
the
turn
of
a
phrase
by
which
lucien
deliberately
tried
to
wound
her
pride
ah
madame
la
comtesse
i
can
not
bring
you
the
guest
if
the
man
is
in
disgrace
said
lucien
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
turned
and
greeted
the
bishop
with
stately
grace
your
lordship
prophecy
has
been
partially
fulfilled
he
said
and
there
was
a
winning
charm
in
his
tones
i
will
endeavor
to
fulfil
it
to
the
letter
i
consider
myself
very
fortunate
since
this
evening
brings
me
an
opportunity
of
paying
my
respects
to
you
lucien
drew
the
bishop
into
a
conversation
that
lasted
for
ten
minutes
the
women
looked
on
lucien
as
a
phenomenon
his
unexpected
insolence
had
struck
mme
du
chatelet
dumb
she
could
not
find
an
answer
looking
round
the
room
she
saw
that
every
woman
admired
lucien
she
watched
group
after
group
repeating
the
phrases
by
which
lucien
crushed
her
with
seeming
disdain
and
her
heart
contracted
with
a
spasm
of
mortification
suppose
that
he
should
not
come
to
the
prefecture
after
this
what
talk
there
would
be
she
thought
where
did
he
learn
this
pride
can
mlle
des
touches
have
taken
a
fancy
for
him
he
is
so
handsome
they
say
that
she
hurried
to
see
him
in
paris
the
day
after
that
actress
died
perhaps
he
has
come
to
the
rescue
of
his
and
happened
to
be
behind
our
caleche
at
mansle
by
accident
lucien
looked
at
us
very
strangely
that
morning
a
crowd
of
thoughts
crossed
louise
brain
and
unluckily
for
her
she
continued
to
ponder
visibly
as
she
watched
lucien
he
was
talking
with
the
bishop
as
if
he
were
the
king
of
the
room
making
no
effort
to
find
any
one
out
waiting
till
others
came
to
him
looking
round
about
him
with
varying
expression
and
as
much
at
his
ease
as
his
model
de
marsay
de
senonches
appeared
at
no
great
distance
but
lucien
still
stood
beside
the
prelate
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
louise
could
contain
herself
no
longer
she
rose
and
went
over
to
the
bishop
and
said
what
is
being
said
my
lord
that
you
smile
so
often
lucien
drew
back
discreetly
and
left
mme
du
chatelet
with
his
lordship
ah
mme
la
comtesse
what
a
clever
young
fellow
he
is
he
was
explaining
to
me
that
he
owed
all
he
is
to
you
am
not
ungrateful
madame
said
lucien
with
a
reproachful
glance
that
charmed
the
countess
let
us
have
an
understanding
she
said
beckoning
him
with
her
fan
come
into
the
boudoir
my
lord
bishop
you
shall
judge
between
us
she
has
found
a
funny
task
for
his
lordship
said
one
of
the
chandour
camp
sufficiently
audibly
judge
between
us
repeated
lucien
looking
from
the
prelate
to
the
lady
then
is
one
of
us
in
fault
louise
de
negrepelisse
sat
down
on
the
sofa
in
the
familiar
boudoir
she
made
the
bishop
sit
on
one
side
and
lucien
on
the
other
then
she
began
to
speak
but
lucien
to
the
joy
and
surprise
of
his
old
love
honored
her
with
inattention
her
words
fell
unheeded
on
his
ears
he
sat
like
pasta
in
with
the
words
patria
upon
her
lips
the
music
of
the
great
cavatina
might
have
passed
into
his
face
indeed
coralie
pupil
had
contrived
to
bring
the
tears
to
his
eyes
oh
louise
how
i
loved
you
he
murmured
careless
of
the
presence
heedless
of
the
conversation
as
soon
as
he
knew
that
the
countess
had
seen
the
tears
dry
your
eyes
or
you
will
ruin
me
here
a
second
time
she
said
in
an
aside
that
horrified
the
prelate
and
once
is
enough
was
lucien
quick
retort
that
speech
from
mme
cousin
would
dry
the
eyes
of
a
weeping
magdalene
oh
me
for
a
little
moment
old
memories
and
lost
illusions
and
my
twentieth
year
came
back
to
me
and
you
have
his
lordship
hastily
retreated
to
the
at
this
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
dignity
was
like
to
be
compromised
by
this
sentimental
pair
every
one
ostentatiously
refrained
from
interrupting
them
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
went
by
till
at
last
sixte
du
chatelet
vexed
by
the
laughter
and
talk
and
excursions
to
the
boudoir
door
went
in
with
a
countenance
distinctly
overclouded
and
found
louise
and
lucien
talking
excitedly
madame
said
sixte
in
his
wife
ear
you
know
angouleme
better
than
i
do
and
surely
you
should
think
of
your
position
as
mme
la
prefete
and
of
the
government
my
dear
said
louise
scanning
her
responsible
editor
with
a
haughtiness
that
made
him
quake
i
am
talking
with
de
rubempre
of
matters
which
interest
you
it
is
a
question
of
rescuing
an
inventor
about
to
fall
a
victim
to
the
basest
machinations
you
will
help
us
as
to
those
ladies
yonder
and
their
opinion
of
me
you
shall
see
how
i
will
freeze
the
venom
of
their
tongues
she
came
out
of
the
boudoir
on
lucien
arm
and
drew
him
across
to
sign
the
contract
with
a
great
lady
audacity
write
your
name
after
mine
she
said
handing
him
the
pen
and
lucien
submissively
signed
in
the
place
indicated
beneath
her
name
de
senonches
would
you
have
recognized
de
rubempre
she
continued
and
the
insolent
sportsman
was
compelled
to
greet
lucien
she
returned
to
the
on
lucien
arm
and
seated
him
on
the
central
sofa
between
herself
and
zephirine
there
enthroned
like
a
queen
she
began
at
first
in
a
low
voice
a
conversation
in
which
epigram
evidently
was
not
wanting
some
of
her
old
friends
and
several
women
who
paid
court
to
her
came
to
join
the
group
and
lucien
soon
became
the
hero
of
the
circle
the
countess
drew
him
out
on
the
subject
of
life
in
paris
his
satirical
talk
flowed
with
spontaneous
and
incredible
spirit
he
told
anecdotes
of
celebrities
those
conversational
luxuries
which
the
provincial
devours
with
such
avidity
his
wit
was
as
much
admired
as
his
good
looks
and
mme
la
comtesse
sixte
du
chatelet
preparing
triumph
so
patiently
sat
like
a
player
enraptured
with
the
sound
of
his
instrument
she
gave
him
opportunities
for
a
reply
she
looked
round
the
circle
for
applause
so
openly
that
not
a
few
of
the
women
began
to
think
that
their
return
together
was
something
more
than
a
coincidence
and
that
lucien
and
louise
loving
with
all
their
hearts
had
been
separated
by
a
double
treason
pique
very
likely
had
brought
about
this
match
with
chatelet
and
a
reaction
set
in
against
the
prefect
before
the
countess
rose
to
go
at
one
in
the
morning
she
turned
to
lucien
and
said
in
a
low
voice
do
me
the
pleasure
of
coming
punctually
evening
then
with
the
friendliest
little
nod
she
went
saying
a
few
words
to
chatelet
who
was
looking
for
his
hat
if
mme
du
chatelet
has
given
me
a
correct
idea
of
the
state
of
affairs
count
on
me
my
dear
lucien
said
the
prefect
preparing
to
hurry
after
his
wife
she
was
going
away
without
him
after
the
paris
fashion
your
may
consider
that
his
troubles
are
at
an
end
he
added
as
he
went
le
comte
surely
owes
me
so
much
smiled
lucien
cointet
and
heard
these
farewell
speeches
well
well
we
are
done
for
now
cointet
muttered
in
his
confederate
ear
thunderstruck
by
lucien
success
amazed
by
his
brilliant
wit
and
varying
charm
was
gazing
at
francoise
de
la
haye
the
girl
whole
face
was
full
of
admiration
for
lucien
be
like
your
friend
she
seemed
to
say
to
her
betrothed
a
gleam
of
joy
flitted
over
countenance
we
still
have
a
whole
day
before
the
prefect
dinner
i
will
answer
for
everything
an
hour
later
as
and
lucien
walked
home
together
lucien
talked
of
his
success
well
my
dear
fellow
i
came
i
saw
i
conquered
sechard
will
be
very
happy
in
a
few
hours
time
just
what
i
wanted
to
know
thought
aloud
he
said
i
thought
you
were
simply
a
poet
lucien
but
you
are
a
lauzun
too
that
is
to
say
twice
a
poet
and
they
shook
hands
for
the
last
time
as
it
proved
good
news
dear
eve
said
lucien
waking
his
sister
david
will
have
no
debts
in
less
than
a
month
how
is
that
well
my
louise
is
still
hidden
by
mme
du
chatelet
petticoat
she
loves
me
more
than
ever
she
will
send
a
favorable
report
of
our
discovery
to
the
minister
of
the
interior
through
her
husband
so
we
have
only
to
endure
our
troubles
for
one
month
while
i
avenge
myself
on
the
prefect
and
complete
the
happiness
of
his
married
life
eve
listened
and
thought
that
she
must
be
dreaming
i
saw
the
little
gray
where
i
trembled
like
a
child
two
years
ago
it
seemed
as
if
scales
fell
from
my
eyes
when
i
saw
the
furniture
and
the
pictures
and
the
faces
again
how
paris
changes
one
ideas
is
that
a
good
thing
asked
eve
at
last
beginning
to
understand
come
come
you
are
still
asleep
we
will
talk
about
it
after
breakfast
cerizet
plot
was
exceedingly
simple
a
commonplace
stratagem
familiar
to
the
provincial
bailiff
its
success
entirely
depends
upon
circumstances
and
in
this
case
it
was
certain
so
intimate
was
cerizet
knowledge
of
the
characters
and
hopes
of
those
concerned
cerizet
had
been
a
kind
of
don
juan
among
the
young
ruling
his
victims
by
playing
one
off
against
another
since
he
had
been
the
cointet
extra
foreman
he
had
singled
out
one
of
basine
assistants
a
girl
almost
as
handsome
as
mme
sechard
henriette
signol
parents
owned
a
small
vineyard
two
leagues
out
of
angouleme
on
the
road
to
saintes
the
signols
like
everybody
else
in
the
country
could
not
afford
to
keep
their
only
child
at
home
so
they
meant
her
to
go
out
to
service
in
country
phrase
the
art
of
is
a
part
of
every
country
housemaid
training
and
so
great
was
mme
prieur
reputation
that
the
signols
sent
henriette
to
her
as
apprentice
and
paid
for
their
daughter
board
and
lodging
mme
prieur
was
one
of
the
mistresses
who
consider
that
they
fill
a
parent
place
towards
their
apprentices
they
were
part
of
the
family
she
took
them
with
her
to
church
and
looked
scrupulously
after
them
henriette
signol
was
a
tall
girl
with
bold
eyes
and
long
thick
dark
hair
and
the
pale
very
fair
complexion
of
girls
in
the
south
white
as
a
magnolia
flower
for
which
reasons
henriette
was
one
of
the
first
on
whom
cerizet
cast
his
eyes
but
henriette
came
of
honest
farmer
folk
and
only
yielded
at
last
to
jealousy
to
bad
example
and
the
treacherous
promise
of
subsequent
marriage
by
this
time
cerizet
was
the
cointet
foreman
when
he
learned
that
the
signols
owned
a
vineyard
worth
some
ten
or
twelve
thousand
francs
and
a
tolerably
comfortable
cottage
he
hastened
to
make
it
impossible
for
henriette
to
marry
any
one
else
affairs
had
reached
this
point
when
held
out
the
prospect
of
a
printing
office
and
twenty
thousand
francs
of
borrowed
capital
which
was
to
prove
a
yoke
upon
the
borrower
neck
cerizet
was
dazzled
the
offer
turned
his
head
henriette
signol
was
now
only
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
his
ambitions
and
he
neglected
the
poor
girl
henriette
in
her
despair
clung
more
closely
to
her
seducer
as
he
tried
to
shake
her
off
when
cerizet
began
to
suspect
that
david
was
hiding
in
basine
house
his
views
with
regard
to
henriette
underwent
another
change
though
he
treated
her
as
before
a
kind
of
frenzy
works
in
a
girl
brain
when
she
must
marry
her
seducer
to
conceal
her
dishonor
and
cerizet
was
on
the
watch
to
turn
this
madness
to
his
own
account
during
the
morning
of
the
day
when
lucien
had
set
himself
to
reconquer
his
louise
cerizet
told
basine
secret
to
henriette
giving
her
to
understand
at
the
same
time
that
their
marriage
and
future
prospects
depended
upon
the
discovery
of
david
thus
instructed
henriette
easily
made
certain
of
the
fact
that
david
was
in
basine
clerget
inner
room
it
never
occurred
to
the
girl
that
she
was
doing
wrong
to
act
the
spy
and
cerizet
involved
her
in
the
guilt
of
betrayal
by
this
first
step
lucien
was
still
sleeping
while
cerizet
closeted
with
heard
the
history
of
the
important
trifles
with
which
all
angouleme
presently
would
ring
the
cointets
foreman
gave
a
satisfied
nod
as
came
to
an
end
lucien
surely
has
written
you
a
line
since
he
came
back
has
he
not
he
asked
this
is
all
that
i
have
answered
the
lawyer
and
he
held
out
a
note
on
mme
sechard
very
well
said
cerizet
let
doublon
be
in
wait
at
the
palet
gate
about
ten
minutes
before
sunset
tell
him
to
post
his
gendarmes
and
you
shall
have
our
man
are
you
sure
of
part
of
the
business
asked
scanning
cerizet
i
rely
on
chance
said
the
boy
and
she
is
a
saucy
huzzy
she
does
not
like
honest
folk
you
must
succeed
said
cerizet
you
have
pushed
me
into
this
dirty
business
you
may
as
well
let
me
have
a
few
banknotes
to
wipe
off
the
stains
then
detecting
a
look
that
he
did
not
like
in
the
face
he
continued
with
a
deadly
glance
if
you
have
cheated
me
sir
if
you
do
buy
the
for
me
within
a
week
you
will
leave
a
young
widow
he
lowered
his
voice
if
we
have
david
on
the
jail
register
at
six
come
round
to
gannerac
at
nine
and
we
will
settle
your
business
said
peremptorily
agreed
your
will
shall
be
done
governor
said
cerizet
cerizet
understood
the
art
of
washing
paper
a
dangerous
art
for
the
treasury
he
washed
out
lucien
four
lines
and
replaced
them
imitating
the
handwriting
with
a
dexterity
which
augured
ill
for
his
own
future
my
dear
david
your
business
is
settled
you
need
not
fear
to
go
to
the
prefect
you
can
go
out
at
sunset
i
will
come
to
meet
you
and
tell
you
what
to
do
at
the
your
brother
lucien
at
noon
lucien
wrote
to
david
telling
him
of
his
evening
success
the
prefect
would
be
sure
to
lend
his
influence
he
said
he
was
full
of
enthusiasm
over
the
invention
and
was
drawing
up
a
report
that
very
day
to
send
to
the
government
marion
carried
the
letter
to
basine
taking
some
of
lucien
linen
to
the
laundry
as
a
pretext
for
the
errand
had
told
cerizet
that
a
letter
would
in
all
probability
be
sent
cerizet
called
for
mlle
signol
and
the
two
walked
by
the
charente
henriette
integrity
must
have
held
out
for
a
long
while
for
the
walk
lasted
for
two
hours
a
whole
future
of
happiness
and
ease
and
the
interests
of
a
child
were
at
stake
and
cerizet
asked
a
mere
trifle
of
her
he
was
very
careful
besides
to
say
nothing
of
the
consequences
of
that
trifle
she
was
only
to
carry
a
letter
and
a
message
that
was
all
but
it
was
the
greatness
of
the
reward
for
the
trifling
service
that
frightened
henriette
nevertheless
cerizet
gained
her
consent
at
last
she
would
help
him
in
his
stratagem
at
five
henriette
must
go
out
and
come
in
again
telling
basine
clerget
that
mme
sechard
wanted
to
speak
to
her
at
once
fifteen
minutes
after
basine
departure
she
must
go
upstairs
knock
at
the
door
of
the
inner
room
and
give
david
the
forged
note
that
was
all
cerizet
looked
to
chance
to
manage
the
rest
for
the
first
time
in
twelve
months
eve
felt
the
iron
grasp
of
necessity
relax
a
little
she
began
at
last
to
hope
she
too
would
enjoy
her
brother
visit
she
would
show
herself
abroad
on
the
arm
of
a
man
feted
in
his
native
town
adored
by
the
women
beloved
by
the
proud
comtesse
du
chatelet
she
dressed
herself
prettily
and
proposed
to
walk
out
after
dinner
with
her
brother
to
beaulieu
in
september
all
angouleme
comes
out
at
that
hour
to
breathe
the
fresh
air
oh
that
is
the
beautiful
mme
sechard
voices
said
here
and
there
i
should
never
have
believed
it
of
her
said
a
woman
the
husband
is
in
hiding
and
the
wife
walks
abroad
said
mme
postel
for
young
mme
sechard
benefit
oh
let
us
go
home
said
poor
eve
i
have
made
a
mistake
a
few
minutes
before
sunset
the
sound
of
a
crowd
rose
from
the
steps
that
lead
down
to
apparently
some
crime
had
been
committed
for
persons
coming
from
were
talking
among
themselves
curiosity
drew
lucien
and
eve
towards
the
steps
a
thief
has
just
been
arrested
no
doubt
the
man
looks
as
pale
as
death
one
of
these
said
to
the
brother
and
sister
the
crowd
grew
larger
lucien
and
eve
watched
a
group
of
some
thirty
children
old
women
and
men
returning
from
work
clustering
about
the
gendarmes
whose
caps
gleamed
above
the
heads
of
the
rest
about
a
hundred
persons
followed
the
procession
the
crowd
gathering
like
a
storm
cloud
oh
it
is
my
husband
eve
cried
out
david
exclaimed
lucien
it
is
his
wife
said
voices
and
the
crowd
made
way
what
made
you
come
out
asked
lucien
your
letter
said
david
haggard
and
white
i
knew
it
said
eve
and
she
fainted
away
lucien
raised
his
sister
and
with
the
help
of
two
strangers
he
carried
her
home
marion
laid
her
in
bed
and
kolb
rushed
off
for
a
doctor
eve
was
still
insensible
when
the
doctor
arrived
and
lucien
was
obliged
to
confess
to
his
mother
that
he
was
the
cause
of
david
arrest
for
he
of
course
knew
nothing
of
the
forged
letter
and
cerizet
stratagem
then
he
went
up
to
his
room
and
locked
himself
in
struck
dumb
by
the
malediction
in
his
mother
eyes
in
the
dead
of
night
he
wrote
one
more
letter
amid
constant
interruptions
the
reader
can
divine
the
agony
of
the
writer
mind
from
those
phrases
jerked
out
as
it
were
one
by
one
my
beloved
sister
we
have
seen
each
other
for
the
last
time
my
resolution
is
final
and
for
this
reason
in
many
families
there
is
one
unlucky
member
a
kind
of
disease
in
their
midst
i
am
that
unlucky
one
in
our
family
the
observation
is
not
mine
it
was
made
at
a
friendly
supper
one
evening
at
the
de
by
a
diplomate
who
has
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
while
we
laughed
and
joked
he
explained
the
reason
why
some
young
lady
or
some
other
remained
unmarried
to
the
astonishment
of
the
world
it
was
touch
of
her
father
he
said
and
with
that
he
unfolded
his
theory
of
inherited
weaknesses
he
told
us
how
such
and
such
a
family
would
have
flourished
but
for
the
mother
how
it
was
that
a
son
had
ruined
his
father
or
a
father
had
stripped
his
children
of
prospects
and
respectability
it
was
said
laughingly
but
we
thought
of
so
many
cases
in
point
in
ten
minutes
that
i
was
struck
with
the
theory
the
amount
of
truth
in
it
furnished
all
sorts
of
wild
paradoxes
which
journalists
maintain
cleverly
enough
for
their
own
amusement
when
there
is
nobody
else
at
hand
to
mystify
i
bring
bad
luck
to
our
family
my
heart
is
full
of
love
for
you
yet
i
behave
like
an
enemy
the
blow
dealt
unintentionally
is
the
cruelest
blow
of
all
while
i
was
leading
a
bohemian
life
in
paris
a
life
made
up
of
pleasure
and
misery
taking
good
fellowship
for
friendship
forsaking
my
true
friends
for
those
who
wished
to
exploit
me
and
succeeded
forgetful
of
you
or
remembering
you
only
to
cause
you
trouble
all
that
while
you
were
walking
in
the
humble
path
of
hard
work
making
your
way
slowly
but
surely
to
the
fortune
which
i
tried
so
madly
to
snatch
while
you
grew
better
i
grew
worse
a
fatal
element
entered
into
my
life
through
my
own
choice
yes
unbounded
ambition
makes
an
obscure
existence
simply
impossible
for
me
i
have
tastes
and
remembrances
of
past
pleasures
that
poison
the
enjoyments
within
my
reach
once
i
should
have
been
satisfied
with
them
now
it
is
too
late
oh
dear
eve
no
one
can
think
more
hardly
of
me
than
i
do
myself
my
condemnation
is
absolute
and
pitiless
the
struggle
in
paris
demands
steady
effort
my
will
power
is
spasmodic
my
brain
works
intermittently
the
future
is
so
appalling
that
i
do
not
care
to
face
it
and
the
present
is
intolerable
i
wanted
to
see
you
again
i
should
have
done
better
to
stay
in
exile
all
my
days
but
exile
without
means
of
subsistence
would
be
madness
i
will
not
add
another
folly
to
the
rest
death
is
better
than
a
maimed
life
i
can
not
think
of
myself
in
any
position
in
which
my
overweening
vanity
would
not
lead
me
into
folly
some
human
beings
are
like
the
figure
another
must
be
put
before
it
and
they
acquire
ten
times
their
value
i
am
nothing
unless
a
strong
inexorable
will
is
wedded
to
mine
mme
de
bargeton
was
in
truth
my
wife
when
i
refused
to
leave
coralie
for
her
i
spoiled
my
life
you
and
david
might
have
been
excellent
pilots
for
me
but
you
are
not
strong
enough
to
tame
my
weakness
which
in
some
sort
eludes
control
i
like
an
easy
life
a
life
without
cares
to
clear
an
obstacle
out
of
my
way
i
can
descend
to
baseness
that
sticks
at
nothing
i
was
born
a
prince
i
have
more
than
the
requisite
intellectual
dexterity
for
success
but
only
by
moments
and
the
prizes
of
a
career
so
crowded
by
ambitious
competitors
are
to
those
who
expend
no
more
than
the
necessary
strength
and
retain
a
sufficient
reserve
when
they
reach
the
goal
i
shall
do
harm
again
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
some
men
are
like
oaks
i
am
a
delicate
shrub
it
may
be
and
i
forsooth
must
needs
aspire
to
be
a
forest
cedar
there
you
have
my
bankrupt
schedule
the
disproportion
between
my
powers
and
my
desires
my
want
of
balance
in
short
will
bring
all
my
efforts
to
nothing
there
are
many
such
characters
among
men
of
letters
many
men
whose
intellectual
powers
and
character
are
always
at
variance
who
will
one
thing
and
wish
another
what
would
become
of
me
i
can
see
it
all
beforehand
as
i
think
of
this
and
that
great
light
that
once
shone
on
paris
now
utterly
forgotten
on
the
threshold
of
old
age
i
shall
be
a
man
older
than
my
age
needy
and
without
a
name
my
whole
soul
rises
up
against
the
thought
of
such
a
close
i
will
not
be
a
social
rag
ah
dear
sister
loved
and
worshiped
at
least
as
much
for
your
severity
at
the
last
as
for
your
tenderness
at
the
first
if
we
have
paid
so
dear
for
my
joy
at
seeing
you
all
once
more
you
and
david
may
perhaps
some
day
think
that
you
could
grudge
no
price
however
high
for
a
little
last
happiness
for
an
unhappy
creature
who
loved
you
do
not
try
to
find
me
eve
do
not
seek
to
know
what
becomes
of
me
my
intellect
for
once
shall
be
backed
by
my
will
renunciation
my
angel
is
daily
death
of
self
my
renunciation
will
only
last
for
one
day
i
will
take
advantage
now
of
that
day
yes
i
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
farewell
for
ever
dear
eve
there
is
something
sweet
in
the
thought
that
i
shall
live
only
in
your
hearts
henceforth
and
i
wish
no
other
burying
place
once
more
farewell
that
is
the
last
word
from
your
brother
lucien
lucien
read
the
letter
over
crept
noiselessly
down
stairs
and
left
it
in
the
child
cradle
amid
falling
tears
he
set
a
last
kiss
on
the
forehead
of
his
sleeping
sister
then
he
went
out
he
put
out
his
candle
in
the
gray
dusk
took
a
last
look
at
the
old
house
stole
softly
along
the
passage
and
opened
the
street
door
but
in
spite
of
his
caution
he
awakened
kolb
who
slept
on
a
mattress
on
the
workshop
floor
who
goes
there
cried
kolb
it
is
i
lucien
i
am
going
away
kolb
you
vould
haf
done
better
gif
you
at
nefer
kom
kolb
muttered
audibly
i
should
have
done
better
still
if
i
had
never
come
into
the
world
lucien
answered
kolb
i
do
bear
you
any
grudge
for
thinking
as
i
think
myself
tell
david
that
i
was
sorry
i
could
not
bid
him
and
say
that
this
was
my
last
thought
by
the
time
the
alsacien
was
up
and
dressed
lucien
had
shut
the
house
door
and
was
on
his
way
towards
the
charente
by
the
promenade
de
beaulieu
he
might
have
been
going
to
a
festival
for
he
had
put
on
his
new
clothes
from
paris
and
his
dandy
trinkets
for
a
drowning
shroud
something
in
lucien
tone
had
struck
kolb
at
first
the
man
thought
of
going
to
ask
his
mistress
whether
she
knew
that
her
brother
had
left
the
house
but
as
the
deepest
silence
prevailed
he
concluded
that
the
departure
had
been
arranged
beforehand
and
lay
down
again
and
slept
little
considering
the
gravity
of
the
question
has
been
written
on
the
subject
of
suicide
it
has
not
been
studied
perhaps
it
is
a
disease
that
can
not
be
observed
suicide
is
one
effect
of
a
sentiment
which
we
will
call
if
you
will
to
prevent
confusion
by
using
the
word
honor
when
a
man
despises
himself
and
sees
that
others
despise
him
when
real
life
fails
to
fulfil
his
hopes
then
comes
the
moment
when
he
takes
his
life
and
thereby
does
homage
to
society
shorn
of
his
virtues
or
his
splendor
he
does
not
care
to
face
his
fellows
among
atheists
christians
being
without
the
question
of
suicide
among
atheists
whatever
may
be
said
to
the
contrary
none
but
a
base
coward
can
take
up
a
dishonored
life
there
are
three
kinds
of
suicide
the
first
is
only
the
last
and
acute
stage
of
a
long
illness
and
this
kind
belongs
distinctly
to
pathology
the
second
is
the
suicide
of
despair
and
the
third
the
suicide
based
on
logical
argument
despair
and
deductive
reasoning
had
brought
lucien
to
this
pass
but
both
varieties
are
curable
it
is
only
the
pathological
suicide
that
is
inevitable
not
infrequently
you
find
all
three
causes
combined
as
in
the
case
of
rousseau
lucien
having
made
up
his
mind
fell
to
considering
methods
the
poet
would
fain
die
as
became
a
poet
at
first
he
thought
of
throwing
himself
into
the
charente
and
making
an
end
then
and
there
but
as
he
came
down
the
steps
from
beaulieu
for
the
last
time
he
heard
the
whole
town
talking
of
his
suicide
he
saw
the
horrid
sight
of
a
drowned
dead
body
and
thought
of
the
recognition
and
the
inquest
and
like
some
other
suicides
felt
that
vanity
reached
beyond
death
he
remembered
the
day
spent
at
courtois
mill
and
his
thoughts
returned
to
the
round
pool
among
the
willows
that
he
saw
as
he
came
along
by
the
little
river
such
a
pool
as
you
often
find
on
small
streams
with
a
still
smooth
surface
that
conceals
great
depths
beneath
the
water
is
neither
green
nor
blue
nor
white
nor
tawny
it
is
like
a
polished
steel
mirror
no
grows
about
the
margin
there
are
no
blue
water
nor
broad
lily
leaves
the
grass
at
the
brim
is
short
and
thick
and
the
weeping
willows
that
droop
over
the
edge
grow
picturesquely
enough
it
is
easy
to
imagine
a
sheer
precipice
beneath
filled
with
water
to
the
brim
any
man
who
should
have
the
courage
to
fill
his
pockets
with
pebbles
would
not
fail
to
find
death
and
never
be
seen
thereafter
at
the
time
while
he
admired
the
lovely
miniature
of
a
landscape
the
poet
had
thought
to
himself
is
a
spot
to
make
your
mouth
water
for
a
he
thought
of
it
now
as
he
went
down
into
and
when
he
took
his
way
towards
marsac
with
the
last
sombre
thoughts
gnawing
at
his
heart
it
was
with
the
firm
resolve
to
hide
his
death
there
should
be
no
inquest
held
over
him
he
would
not
be
laid
in
earth
no
one
should
see
him
in
the
hideous
condition
of
the
corpse
that
floats
on
the
surface
of
the
water
before
long
he
reached
one
of
the
slopes
common
enough
on
all
french
highroads
and
commonest
of
all
between
angouleme
and
poitiers
he
saw
the
coach
from
bordeaux
to
paris
coming
up
at
full
speed
behind
him
and
knew
that
the
passengers
would
probably
alight
to
walk
up
the
hill
he
did
not
care
to
be
seen
just
then
turning
off
sharply
into
a
beaten
track
he
began
to
pick
the
flowers
in
a
vineyard
hard
by
when
lucien
came
back
to
the
road
with
a
great
bunch
of
the
yellow
which
grows
everywhere
upon
the
stony
soil
of
the
vineyards
he
came
out
upon
a
traveler
dressed
in
black
from
head
to
foot
the
stranger
wore
powder
there
were
silver
buckles
on
his
shoes
of
orleans
leather
and
his
brown
face
was
scarred
and
seamed
as
if
he
had
fallen
into
the
fire
in
infancy
the
traveler
so
obviously
clerical
in
his
dress
was
walking
slowly
and
smoking
a
cigar
he
turned
as
lucien
jumped
down
from
the
vineyard
into
the
road
the
deep
melancholy
on
the
handsome
young
face
the
poet
symbolical
flowers
and
his
elegant
dress
seemed
to
strike
the
stranger
he
looked
at
lucien
with
something
of
the
expression
of
a
hunter
that
has
found
his
quarry
at
last
after
long
and
fruitless
search
he
allowed
lucien
to
come
alongside
in
nautical
phrase
then
he
slackened
his
pace
and
appeared
to
look
along
the
road
up
the
hill
lucien
following
the
direction
of
his
eyes
saw
a
light
traveling
carriage
with
two
horses
and
a
standing
beside
it
you
have
allowed
the
coach
to
pass
you
monsieur
you
will
lose
your
place
unless
you
care
to
take
a
seat
in
my
caleche
and
overtake
the
mail
for
it
is
rather
quicker
traveling
post
than
by
the
public
conveyance
the
traveler
spoke
with
extreme
politeness
and
a
very
marked
spanish
accent
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
drew
a
from
his
pocket
opened
it
and
held
it
out
to
lucien
i
am
not
on
a
journey
said
lucien
and
i
am
too
near
the
end
of
my
stage
to
indulge
in
the
pleasure
of
smoking
you
are
very
severe
with
yourself
returned
the
spaniard
though
i
am
a
canon
of
the
cathedral
of
toledo
i
occasionally
smoke
a
cigarette
god
gave
us
tobacco
to
allay
our
passions
and
our
pains
you
seem
to
be
downcast
or
at
any
rate
you
carry
the
symbolical
flower
of
sorrow
in
your
hand
like
the
rueful
god
hymen
come
all
your
troubles
will
vanish
away
with
the
smoke
and
again
the
ecclesiastic
held
out
his
little
straw
case
there
was
something
fascinating
in
his
manner
and
kindliness
towards
lucien
lighted
up
his
eyes
forgive
me
father
lucien
answered
stiffly
there
is
no
cigar
that
can
scatter
my
troubles
tears
came
to
his
eyes
at
the
words
it
must
surely
be
divine
providence
that
prompted
me
to
take
a
little
exercise
to
shake
off
a
traveler
morning
drowsiness
said
the
churchman
a
divine
prompting
to
fulfil
my
mission
here
on
earth
by
consoling
what
great
trouble
can
you
have
at
your
age
your
consolations
father
can
do
nothing
for
me
you
are
a
spaniard
i
am
a
frenchman
you
believe
in
the
commandments
of
the
church
i
am
an
atheist
virgen
del
you
are
an
atheist
cried
the
other
laying
a
hand
on
lucien
arm
with
maternal
solicitude
ah
here
is
one
of
the
curious
things
i
promised
myself
to
see
in
paris
we
in
spain
do
not
believe
in
atheists
there
is
no
country
but
france
where
one
can
have
such
opinions
at
nineteen
years
oh
i
am
an
atheist
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
i
have
no
belief
in
god
in
society
in
happiness
take
a
good
look
at
me
father
for
in
a
few
hours
time
life
will
be
over
for
me
my
last
sun
has
risen
said
lucien
with
a
sort
of
rhetorical
effect
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
sky
how
so
what
have
you
done
that
you
must
die
who
has
condemned
you
to
die
a
tribunal
from
which
there
is
no
appeal
i
myself
you
child
cried
the
priest
have
you
killed
a
man
is
the
scaffold
waiting
for
you
let
us
reason
together
a
little
if
you
are
resolved
as
you
say
to
return
to
nothingness
everything
on
earth
is
indifferent
to
you
is
it
not
lucien
bowed
assent
very
well
then
can
you
not
tell
me
about
your
troubles
some
little
affair
of
the
heart
has
taken
a
bad
turn
no
doubt
lucien
shrugged
his
shoulders
very
significantly
are
you
resolved
to
kill
yourself
to
escape
dishonor
or
do
you
despair
of
life
very
good
you
can
kill
yourself
at
poitiers
quite
as
easily
as
at
angouleme
and
at
tours
it
will
be
no
harder
than
at
poitiers
the
quicksands
of
the
loire
never
give
up
their
prey
no
father
said
lucien
i
have
settled
it
all
not
three
weeks
ago
i
chanced
upon
the
most
charming
raft
that
can
ferry
a
man
sick
and
tired
of
this
life
into
the
other
world
the
other
world
you
are
not
an
atheist
oh
by
another
world
i
mean
my
next
transformation
animal
or
plant
have
you
some
incurable
disease
yes
father
ah
now
we
come
to
the
point
what
is
it
poverty
the
priest
looked
at
lucien
the
diamond
does
not
know
its
own
value
he
said
and
there
was
an
inexpressible
charm
and
a
touch
of
something
like
irony
in
his
smile
none
but
a
priest
could
flatter
a
poor
man
about
to
die
exclaimed
lucien
you
are
not
going
to
die
the
spaniard
returned
authoritatively
i
have
heard
many
times
of
men
that
were
robbed
on
the
highroad
but
i
have
never
yet
heard
of
one
that
found
a
fortune
there
said
lucien
you
will
hear
of
one
now
said
the
priest
glancing
towards
the
carriage
to
measure
the
time
still
left
for
their
walk
together
listen
to
me
he
continued
with
his
cigar
between
his
teeth
if
you
are
poor
that
is
no
reason
why
you
should
die
i
need
a
secretary
for
mine
has
just
died
at
barcelona
i
am
in
the
same
position
as
the
famous
baron
goertz
minister
of
charles
xii
he
was
traveling
toward
sweden
just
as
i
am
going
to
paris
and
in
some
little
town
or
other
he
chanced
upon
the
son
of
a
goldsmith
a
young
man
of
remarkable
good
looks
though
they
could
scarcely
equal
yours
baron
goertz
discerned
intelligence
in
the
young
man
just
as
i
see
poetry
on
your
brow
he
took
him
into
his
traveling
carriage
as
i
shall
take
you
very
shortly
and
of
a
boy
condemned
to
spend
his
days
in
burnishing
spoons
and
forks
and
making
trinkets
in
some
little
town
like
angouleme
he
made
a
favorite
as
you
shall
be
mine
arrived
at
stockholm
he
installed
his
secretary
and
overwhelmed
him
with
work
the
young
man
spent
his
nights
in
writing
and
like
all
great
workers
he
contracted
a
bad
habit
a
trick
he
took
to
chewing
paper
the
late
de
malesherbes
use
to
rap
people
over
the
knuckles
and
he
did
this
once
by
the
by
to
somebody
or
other
whose
suit
depended
upon
him
the
handsome
young
secretary
began
by
chewing
blank
paper
found
it
insipid
for
a
while
and
acquired
a
taste
for
manuscript
as
having
more
flavor
people
did
not
smoke
as
yet
in
those
days
at
last
from
flavor
to
flavor
he
began
to
chew
parchment
and
swallow
it
now
at
that
time
a
treaty
was
being
negotiated
between
russia
and
sweden
the
insisted
that
charles
xii
should
make
peace
much
as
they
tried
in
france
to
make
napoleon
treat
for
peace
in
and
the
basis
of
these
negotiations
was
the
treaty
between
the
two
powers
with
regard
to
finland
goertz
gave
the
original
into
his
secretary
keeping
but
when
the
time
came
for
laying
the
draft
before
the
a
trifling
difficulty
arose
the
treaty
was
not
to
be
found
the
believed
that
the
minister
pandering
to
the
king
wishes
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
get
rid
of
the
document
baron
goertz
was
in
fact
accused
of
this
and
the
secretary
owned
that
he
had
eaten
the
treaty
he
was
tried
and
convicted
and
condemned
to
but
you
have
not
come
to
that
yet
so
take
a
cigar
and
smoke
till
we
reach
the
caleche
lucien
took
a
cigar
and
lit
it
spanish
fashion
at
the
cigar
he
is
right
he
thought
i
can
take
my
life
at
any
time
it
often
happens
that
a
young
man
fortunes
take
a
turn
when
despair
is
darkest
the
spaniard
continued
that
is
what
i
wished
to
tell
you
but
i
preferred
to
prove
it
by
a
case
in
point
here
was
the
handsome
young
secretary
lying
under
sentence
of
death
and
his
case
the
more
desperate
because
as
he
had
been
condemned
by
the
the
king
could
not
pardon
him
but
he
connived
at
his
escape
the
secretary
stole
away
in
a
with
a
few
crowns
in
his
pocket
and
reached
the
court
of
courland
with
a
letter
of
introduction
from
goertz
explaining
his
secretary
adventures
and
his
craze
for
paper
the
duke
of
courland
was
a
spendthrift
he
had
a
steward
and
a
pretty
wife
three
several
causes
of
ruin
he
placed
the
charming
young
stranger
with
his
steward
if
you
can
imagine
that
the
sometime
secretary
had
been
cured
of
his
depraved
taste
by
a
sentence
of
death
you
do
not
know
the
grip
that
a
man
failings
have
upon
him
let
a
man
discover
some
satisfaction
for
himself
and
the
headsman
will
not
keep
him
from
how
is
it
that
the
vice
has
this
power
is
it
inherent
strength
in
the
vice
or
inherent
weakness
in
human
nature
are
there
certain
tastes
that
should
be
regarded
as
verging
on
insanity
for
myself
i
can
not
help
laughing
at
the
moralists
who
try
to
expel
such
diseases
by
fine
well
it
so
fell
out
that
the
steward
refused
a
demand
for
money
and
the
duke
taking
fright
at
this
called
for
an
audit
sheer
imbecility
nothing
easier
than
to
make
out
a
the
difficulty
never
lies
there
the
steward
gave
his
secretary
all
the
necessary
documents
for
compiling
a
schedule
of
the
civil
list
of
courland
he
had
nearly
finished
it
when
in
the
dead
of
night
the
unhappy
discovered
that
he
was
chewing
up
one
of
the
duke
discharges
for
a
considerable
sum
he
had
eaten
half
the
signature
horror
seized
upon
him
he
fled
to
the
duchess
flung
himself
at
her
feet
told
her
of
his
craze
and
implored
the
aid
of
his
sovereign
lady
implored
her
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
handsome
young
face
made
such
an
impression
on
the
duchess
that
she
married
him
as
soon
as
she
was
left
a
widow
and
so
in
the
eighteenth
century
in
a
land
where
the
is
king
the
goldsmith
son
became
a
prince
and
something
more
on
the
death
of
catherine
he
was
regent
he
ruled
the
empress
anne
and
tried
to
be
the
richelieu
of
russia
very
well
young
man
now
know
this
if
you
are
handsomer
than
biron
i
simple
canon
that
i
am
am
worth
more
than
a
baron
goertz
so
get
in
we
will
find
a
duchy
of
courland
for
you
in
paris
or
failing
the
duchy
we
shall
certainly
find
the
duchess
the
spanish
priest
laid
a
hand
on
lucien
arm
and
literally
forced
him
into
the
traveling
carriage
the
postilion
shut
the
door
now
speak
i
am
listening
said
the
canon
of
toledo
to
bewilderment
i
am
an
old
priest
you
can
tell
me
everything
there
is
nothing
to
fear
so
far
we
have
only
run
through
our
patrimony
or
squandered
mamma
money
we
have
made
a
flitting
from
our
creditors
and
we
are
honor
personified
down
to
the
tips
of
our
elegant
little
boots
come
confess
boldly
it
will
be
just
as
if
you
were
talking
to
yourself
lucien
felt
like
that
hero
of
an
eastern
tale
the
fisher
who
tried
to
drown
himself
in
and
sank
down
to
find
himself
a
king
of
countries
under
the
sea
the
spanish
priest
seemed
so
really
affectionate
that
the
poet
hesitated
no
longer
between
angouleme
and
ruffec
he
told
the
story
of
his
whole
life
omitting
none
of
his
misdeeds
and
ended
with
the
final
catastrophe
which
he
had
brought
about
the
tale
only
gained
in
poetic
charm
because
this
was
the
third
time
he
had
told
it
in
the
past
fortnight
just
as
he
made
an
end
they
passed
the
house
of
the
rastignac
family
young
rastignac
left
that
place
for
paris
said
lucien
he
is
certainly
not
my
equal
but
he
has
had
better
luck
the
spaniard
started
at
the
name
oh
he
said
yes
that
shy
little
place
belongs
to
his
father
as
i
was
telling
you
just
now
he
was
the
lover
of
mme
de
nucingen
the
famous
banker
wife
i
drifted
into
poetry
he
was
cleverer
he
took
the
practical
side
the
priest
stopped
the
caleche
and
was
so
far
curious
as
to
walk
down
the
little
avenue
that
led
to
the
house
showing
more
interest
in
the
place
than
lucien
expected
from
a
spanish
ecclesiastic
then
do
you
know
the
rastignacs
asked
lucien
i
know
every
one
in
paris
said
the
spaniard
taking
his
place
again
in
the
carriage
and
so
for
want
of
ten
or
twelve
thousand
francs
you
were
about
to
take
your
life
you
are
a
child
you
know
neither
men
nor
things
a
man
future
is
worth
the
value
that
he
chooses
to
set
upon
it
and
you
value
yours
at
twelve
thousand
francs
well
i
will
give
more
than
that
for
you
any
time
as
for
your
imprisonment
it
is
the
merest
trifle
if
this
dear
sechard
has
made
a
discovery
he
will
be
a
rich
man
some
day
and
a
rich
man
has
never
been
imprisoned
for
debt
you
do
not
seem
to
me
to
be
strong
in
history
history
is
of
two
kinds
there
is
the
official
history
taught
in
schools
a
lying
compilation
usum
and
there
is
the
secret
history
which
deals
with
the
real
causes
of
events
a
scandalous
chronicle
let
me
tell
you
briefly
a
little
story
which
you
have
not
heard
there
was
once
upon
a
time
a
man
young
and
ambitious
and
a
priest
to
boot
he
wanted
to
enter
upon
a
political
career
so
he
fawned
on
the
queen
favorite
the
favorite
took
an
interest
in
him
gave
him
the
rank
of
minister
and
a
seat
at
the
council
board
one
evening
somebody
wrote
to
the
young
aspirant
thinking
to
do
him
a
service
never
do
a
service
by
the
by
unless
you
are
asked
and
told
him
that
his
benefactor
life
was
in
danger
the
king
wrath
was
kindled
against
his
rival
if
the
favorite
went
to
the
palace
he
would
certainly
be
stabbed
so
said
the
letter
well
now
young
man
what
would
you
have
done
i
should
have
gone
at
once
to
warn
my
benefactor
lucien
exclaimed
quickly
you
are
indeed
the
child
which
your
story
reveals
said
the
priest
our
man
said
to
himself
the
king
is
resolved
to
go
to
such
lengths
it
is
all
over
with
my
benefactor
i
must
receive
this
letter
too
late
so
he
slept
on
till
the
favorite
was
stabbed
he
was
a
monster
said
lucien
suspecting
that
the
priest
meant
to
sound
him
so
are
all
great
men
this
one
was
the
cardinal
de
richelieu
and
his
benefactor
was
the
marechal
you
really
do
not
know
your
history
of
france
you
see
was
i
not
right
when
i
told
you
that
history
as
taught
in
schools
is
simply
a
collection
of
facts
and
dates
more
than
doubtful
in
the
first
place
and
with
no
bearing
whatever
on
the
gist
of
the
matter
you
are
told
that
such
a
person
as
jeanne
darc
once
existed
where
is
the
use
of
that
have
you
never
drawn
your
own
conclusions
from
that
fact
never
seen
that
if
france
had
accepted
the
angevin
dynasty
of
the
plantagenets
the
two
peoples
thus
reunited
would
be
ruling
the
world
and
the
islands
that
now
brew
political
storms
for
the
continent
would
be
french
provinces
why
have
you
so
much
as
studied
the
means
by
which
simple
merchants
like
the
medicis
became
grand
dukes
of
tuscany
a
poet
in
france
is
not
bound
to
be
learned
as
a
benedictine
said
lucien
well
they
became
as
richelieu
became
a
minister
if
you
had
looked
into
history
for
the
causes
of
events
instead
of
getting
the
headings
by
heart
you
would
have
found
precepts
for
your
guidance
in
this
life
these
real
facts
taken
at
random
from
among
so
many
supply
you
with
the
axiom
upon
men
and
on
women
most
of
all
as
your
instruments
but
never
let
them
see
this
if
some
one
higher
in
place
can
be
useful
to
you
worship
him
as
your
god
and
never
leave
him
until
he
has
paid
the
price
of
your
servility
to
the
last
farthing
in
your
intercourse
with
men
in
short
be
grasping
and
mean
as
a
jew
all
that
the
jew
does
for
money
you
must
do
for
power
and
besides
all
this
when
a
man
has
fallen
from
power
care
no
more
for
him
than
if
he
had
ceased
to
exist
and
do
you
ask
why
you
must
do
these
things
you
mean
to
rule
the
world
do
you
not
you
must
begin
by
obeying
and
studying
it
scholars
study
books
politicians
study
men
and
their
interests
and
the
springs
of
action
society
and
mankind
in
masses
are
fatalists
they
bow
down
and
worship
the
accomplished
fact
do
you
know
why
i
am
giving
you
this
little
history
lesson
it
seems
to
me
that
your
ambition
is
boundless
yes
father
i
saw
that
myself
said
the
priest
but
at
this
moment
you
are
thinking
is
this
spanish
canon
inventing
anecdotes
and
straining
history
to
prove
to
me
that
i
have
too
much
virtue
lucien
began
to
smile
his
thoughts
had
been
read
so
clearly
very
well
let
us
take
facts
that
every
schoolboy
knows
one
day
france
is
almost
entirely
overrun
by
the
english
the
king
has
only
a
single
province
left
two
figures
arise
from
among
the
people
a
poor
herd
girl
that
very
jeanne
darc
of
whom
we
were
speaking
and
a
burgher
named
jacques
coeur
the
girl
brings
the
power
of
virginity
the
strength
of
her
arm
the
burgher
gives
his
gold
and
the
kingdom
is
saved
the
maid
is
taken
prisoner
and
the
king
who
could
have
ransomed
her
leaves
her
to
be
burned
alive
the
king
allows
his
courtier
to
accuse
the
great
burgher
of
capital
crime
and
they
rob
him
and
divide
all
his
wealth
among
themselves
the
spoils
of
an
innocent
man
hunted
down
brought
to
bay
and
driven
into
exile
by
the
law
went
to
enrich
five
noble
houses
and
the
father
of
the
archbishop
of
bourges
left
the
kingdom
for
ever
without
one
sou
of
all
his
possessions
in
france
and
no
resource
but
moneys
remitted
to
arabs
and
saracens
in
egypt
it
is
open
to
you
to
say
that
these
examples
are
out
of
date
that
three
centuries
of
public
education
have
since
elapsed
and
that
the
outlines
of
those
ages
are
more
or
less
dim
figures
well
young
man
do
you
believe
in
the
last
of
france
in
napoleon
one
of
his
generals
was
in
disgrace
all
through
his
career
napoleon
made
him
a
marshal
grudgingly
and
never
sent
him
on
service
if
he
could
help
it
that
marshal
was
kellermann
do
you
know
the
reason
of
the
grudge
kellermann
saved
france
and
the
first
consul
at
marengo
by
a
brilliant
charge
the
ranks
applauded
under
fire
and
in
the
thick
of
the
carnage
that
heroic
charge
was
not
even
mentioned
in
the
bulletin
napoleon
coolness
toward
kellermann
fouche
fall
and
talleyrand
disgrace
were
all
attributable
to
the
same
cause
it
is
the
ingratitude
of
a
charles
or
a
richelieu
or
but
father
said
lucien
suppose
that
you
should
save
my
life
and
make
my
fortune
you
are
making
the
ties
of
gratitude
somewhat
slight
little
rogue
said
the
abbe
smiling
as
he
pinched
lucien
ear
with
an
almost
royal
familiarity
if
you
are
ungrateful
to
me
it
will
be
because
you
are
a
strong
man
and
i
shall
bend
before
you
but
you
are
not
that
just
yet
as
a
simple
you
have
tried
to
be
master
too
soon
the
common
fault
of
frenchmen
of
your
generation
example
has
spoiled
them
all
you
send
in
your
resignation
because
you
have
not
the
pair
of
epaulettes
that
you
fancied
but
have
you
attempted
to
bring
the
full
force
of
your
will
and
every
action
of
your
life
to
bear
upon
your
one
idea
alas
no
you
have
been
inconsistent
as
the
english
say
smiled
the
canon
what
i
have
been
matters
nothing
now
said
lucien
if
i
can
be
nothing
in
the
future
if
at
the
back
of
all
your
good
qualities
there
is
power
continued
the
priest
not
averse
to
show
that
he
had
a
little
latin
nothing
in
this
world
can
resist
you
i
have
taken
enough
of
a
liking
for
you
already
lucien
smiled
incredulously
yes
said
the
priest
in
answer
to
the
smile
you
interest
me
as
much
as
if
you
had
been
my
son
and
i
am
strong
enough
to
afford
to
talk
to
you
as
openly
as
you
have
just
done
to
me
do
you
know
what
it
is
that
i
like
about
you
this
you
have
made
a
sort
of
within
yourself
and
are
ready
to
hear
a
sermon
on
morality
that
you
will
hear
nowhere
else
for
mankind
in
the
mass
are
even
more
consummate
hypocrites
than
any
one
individual
can
be
when
his
interests
demand
a
piece
of
acting
most
of
us
spend
a
good
part
of
our
lives
in
clearing
our
minds
of
the
notions
that
sprang
up
unchecked
during
our
nonage
this
is
called
our
experience
lucien
listening
thought
within
himself
here
is
some
old
intriguer
delighted
with
a
chance
of
amusing
himself
on
a
journey
he
is
pleased
with
the
idea
of
bringing
about
a
change
of
opinion
in
a
poor
wretch
on
the
brink
of
suicide
and
when
he
is
tired
of
his
amusement
he
will
drop
me
still
he
understands
paradox
and
seems
to
be
quite
a
match
for
blondet
or
lousteau
but
in
spite
of
these
sage
reflections
the
diplomate
poison
had
sunk
deeply
into
lucien
soul
the
ground
was
ready
to
receive
it
and
the
havoc
wrought
was
the
greater
because
such
famous
examples
were
cited
lucien
fell
under
the
charm
of
his
companion
cynical
talk
and
clung
the
more
willingly
to
life
because
he
felt
that
this
arm
which
drew
him
up
from
the
depths
was
a
strong
one
in
this
respect
the
ecclesiastic
had
evidently
won
the
day
and
indeed
from
time
to
time
a
malicious
smile
bore
his
cynical
anecdotes
company
if
your
system
of
morality
at
all
resembles
your
manner
of
regarding
history
said
lucien
i
should
dearly
like
to
know
the
motive
of
your
present
act
of
charity
for
such
it
seems
to
be
there
young
man
i
have
come
to
the
last
head
of
my
sermon
you
will
permit
me
to
reserve
it
for
in
that
case
we
shall
not
part
company
said
the
canon
with
the
tact
of
the
priest
who
sees
that
his
guile
has
succeeded
very
well
talk
morality
said
lucien
to
himself
he
said
i
will
draw
him
out
morality
begins
with
the
law
said
the
priest
if
it
were
simply
a
question
of
religion
laws
would
be
superfluous
religious
peoples
have
few
laws
the
laws
of
statecraft
are
above
civil
law
well
do
you
care
to
know
the
inscription
which
a
politician
can
read
written
at
large
over
your
nineteenth
century
in
the
french
invented
the
idea
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
and
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
came
to
an
end
under
the
absolute
ruler
in
the
emperor
so
much
for
your
history
as
a
nation
now
for
your
private
manners
mme
tallien
and
mme
beauharnais
both
acted
alike
napoleon
married
the
one
and
made
her
your
empress
the
other
he
would
never
receive
at
court
princess
though
she
was
the
of
takes
the
iron
crown
in
the
fanatical
lovers
of
equality
or
death
conspire
fourteen
years
afterwards
with
a
legitimist
aristocracy
to
bring
back
louis
xviii
and
that
same
aristocracy
lording
it
in
the
faubourg
has
done
worse
has
been
merchant
usurer
farmer
and
shepherd
so
in
france
systems
political
and
moral
have
started
from
one
point
and
reached
another
diametrically
opposed
and
men
have
expressed
one
kind
of
opinion
and
acted
on
another
there
has
been
no
consistency
in
national
policy
nor
in
the
conduct
of
individuals
you
can
not
be
said
to
have
any
morality
left
success
is
the
supreme
justification
of
all
actions
whatsoever
the
fact
in
itself
is
nothing
the
impression
that
it
makes
upon
others
is
everything
hence
please
observe
a
second
precept
present
a
fair
exterior
to
the
world
keep
the
seamy
side
of
life
to
yourself
and
turn
a
resplendent
countenance
upon
others
discretion
the
motto
of
every
ambitious
man
is
the
watchword
of
our
order
take
it
for
your
own
great
men
are
guilty
of
almost
as
many
base
deeds
as
poor
outcasts
but
they
are
careful
to
do
these
things
in
shadow
and
to
parade
their
virtues
in
the
light
or
they
would
not
be
great
men
your
insignificant
man
leaves
his
virtues
in
the
shade
he
publicly
displays
his
pitiable
side
and
is
despised
accordingly
you
for
instance
have
hidden
your
titles
to
greatness
and
made
a
display
of
your
worst
failings
you
openly
took
an
actress
for
your
mistress
lived
with
her
and
upon
her
you
were
by
no
means
to
blame
for
this
everybody
admitted
that
both
of
you
were
perfectly
free
to
do
as
you
liked
but
you
ran
full
tilt
against
the
ideas
of
the
world
and
the
world
has
not
shown
you
the
consideration
that
is
shown
to
those
who
obey
the
rules
of
the
game
if
you
had
left
coralie
to
this
camusot
if
you
had
hidden
your
relations
with
her
you
might
have
married
mme
de
bargeton
you
would
now
be
prefect
of
angouleme
and
marquis
de
rubempre
change
your
tactics
bring
your
good
looks
your
charm
your
wit
your
poetry
to
the
front
if
you
indulge
in
small
discreditable
courses
let
it
be
within
four
walls
and
you
will
never
again
be
guilty
of
a
blot
on
the
decorations
of
this
great
theatrical
scene
called
society
napoleon
called
this
dirty
linen
at
home
the
corollary
follows
naturally
on
this
second
precept
form
is
everything
be
careful
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
that
word
there
are
people
who
for
want
of
knowing
better
will
help
themselves
to
money
under
pressure
of
want
and
take
it
by
force
these
people
are
called
criminals
and
perforce
they
square
accounts
with
justice
a
poor
man
of
genius
discovers
some
secret
some
invention
as
good
as
a
treasure
you
lend
him
three
thousand
francs
for
that
practically
the
cointets
have
done
they
hold
your
bills
and
they
are
about
to
rob
your
you
torment
him
until
he
reveals
or
partly
reveals
his
secret
you
settle
your
accounts
with
your
own
conscience
and
your
conscience
does
not
drag
you
into
the
assize
court
the
enemies
of
social
order
beholding
this
contrast
take
occasion
to
yap
at
justice
and
wax
wroth
in
the
name
of
the
people
because
forsooth
burglars
and
are
sent
to
the
hulks
while
a
man
who
brings
whole
families
to
ruin
by
a
fraudulent
bankruptcy
is
let
off
with
a
few
months
imprisonment
but
these
hypocrites
know
quite
well
that
the
judge
who
passes
sentence
on
the
thief
is
maintaining
the
barrier
set
between
the
poor
and
the
rich
and
that
if
that
barrier
were
overturned
social
chaos
would
ensue
while
in
the
case
of
the
bankrupt
the
man
who
steals
an
inheritance
cleverly
and
the
banker
who
slaughters
a
business
for
his
own
benefit
money
merely
changes
hands
that
is
all
society
my
son
is
bound
to
draw
those
distinctions
which
i
have
pointed
out
for
your
benefit
the
one
great
point
is
this
you
must
be
a
match
for
society
napoleon
richelieu
and
the
medicis
were
a
match
for
their
generations
and
as
for
you
you
value
yourself
at
twelve
thousand
francs
you
of
this
generation
in
france
worship
the
golden
calf
what
else
is
the
religion
of
your
charter
that
will
not
recognize
a
man
politically
unless
he
owns
property
what
is
this
but
the
command
to
be
rich
some
day
when
you
shall
have
made
a
fortune
without
breaking
the
law
you
will
be
rich
you
will
be
the
marquis
de
rubempre
and
you
can
indulge
in
the
luxury
of
honor
you
will
be
so
extremely
sensitive
on
the
point
of
honor
that
no
one
will
dare
to
accuse
you
of
past
shortcomings
if
in
the
process
of
making
your
way
you
should
happen
to
smirch
it
now
and
again
which
i
myself
should
never
advise
he
added
patting
lucien
hand
so
what
must
you
put
in
that
comely
head
of
yours
simply
this
and
nothing
more
propose
to
yourself
a
brilliant
and
conspicuous
goal
and
go
towards
it
secretly
let
no
one
see
your
methods
or
your
progress
you
have
behaved
like
a
child
be
a
man
be
a
hunter
lie
in
wait
for
your
quarry
in
the
world
of
paris
wait
for
your
chance
and
your
game
you
need
not
be
particular
nor
mindful
of
your
dignity
as
it
is
called
we
are
all
of
us
slaves
to
something
to
some
failing
of
our
own
or
to
necessity
but
keep
that
law
of
laws
secrecy
father
you
frighten
me
said
lucien
this
seems
to
me
to
be
a
highwayman
theory
and
you
are
right
said
the
canon
but
it
is
no
invention
of
mine
all
reason
in
this
way
the
house
of
austria
and
the
house
of
france
alike
you
have
nothing
you
say
the
medicis
richelieu
and
napoleon
started
from
precisely
your
standpoint
but
my
child
considered
that
their
prospects
were
worth
ingratitude
treachery
and
the
most
glaring
inconsistencies
you
must
dare
all
things
to
gain
all
things
let
us
discuss
it
suppose
that
you
sit
down
to
a
game
of
do
you
begin
to
argue
over
the
rules
of
the
game
there
they
are
you
accept
them
come
now
thought
lucien
he
can
play
and
what
do
you
do
continued
the
priest
do
you
practise
openness
that
fairest
of
virtues
not
merely
do
you
hide
your
tactics
but
you
do
your
best
to
make
others
believe
that
you
are
on
the
brink
of
ruin
as
soon
as
you
are
sure
of
winning
the
game
in
short
you
dissemble
do
you
not
you
lie
to
win
four
or
five
louis
what
would
you
think
of
a
player
so
generous
as
to
proclaim
that
he
held
a
hand
full
of
trumps
very
well
the
ambitious
man
who
carries
virtue
precepts
into
the
arena
when
his
antagonists
have
left
them
behind
is
behaving
like
a
child
old
men
of
the
world
might
say
to
him
as
would
say
to
the
man
who
declines
to
take
advantage
of
his
trumps
you
ought
not
to
play
at
did
you
make
the
rules
of
the
game
of
ambition
why
did
i
tell
you
to
be
a
match
for
society
because
in
these
days
society
by
degrees
has
usurped
so
many
rights
over
the
individual
that
the
individual
is
compelled
to
act
in
there
is
no
question
of
laws
now
their
place
has
been
taken
by
custom
which
is
to
say
grimacings
and
forms
must
always
be
observed
lucien
started
with
surprise
ah
my
child
said
the
priest
afraid
that
he
had
shocked
innocence
did
you
expect
to
find
the
angel
gabriel
in
an
abbe
loaded
with
all
the
iniquities
of
the
diplomacy
and
of
two
kings
i
am
an
agent
between
ferdinand
vii
and
louis
two
kings
who
owe
their
crowns
to
profound
er
combinations
let
us
say
i
believe
in
god
but
i
have
a
still
greater
belief
in
our
order
and
our
order
has
no
belief
save
in
temporal
power
in
order
to
strengthen
and
consolidate
the
temporal
power
our
order
upholds
the
catholic
apostolic
and
roman
church
which
is
to
say
the
doctrines
which
dispose
the
world
at
large
to
obedience
we
are
the
templars
of
modern
times
we
have
a
doctrine
of
our
own
like
the
templars
we
have
been
dispersed
and
for
the
same
reasons
we
are
almost
a
match
for
the
world
if
you
will
enlist
as
a
soldier
i
will
be
your
captain
obey
me
as
a
wife
obeys
her
husband
as
a
child
obeys
his
mother
and
i
will
guarantee
that
you
shall
be
marquis
de
rubempre
in
less
than
six
months
you
shall
marry
into
one
of
the
proudest
houses
in
the
faubourg
and
some
day
you
shall
sit
on
a
bench
with
peers
of
france
what
would
you
have
been
at
this
moment
if
i
had
not
amused
you
by
my
conversation
an
undiscovered
corpse
in
a
deep
bed
of
mud
well
and
good
now
for
an
effort
of
imagination
lucien
looked
curiously
at
his
protector
here
in
this
caleche
beside
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
canon
of
toledo
secret
envoy
from
his
majesty
ferdinand
vii
to
his
majesty
the
king
of
france
bearer
of
a
despatch
thus
worded
it
may
be
you
have
delivered
me
hang
all
those
whom
i
favor
at
this
moment
more
especially
the
bearer
of
this
despatch
for
then
he
can
tell
no
tales
well
beside
this
envoy
sits
a
young
man
who
has
nothing
in
common
with
that
poet
recently
deceased
i
have
fished
you
out
of
the
water
i
have
brought
you
to
life
again
you
belong
to
me
as
the
creature
belongs
to
the
creator
as
the
efrits
of
fairytales
belong
to
the
genii
as
the
janissary
to
the
sultan
as
the
soul
to
the
body
i
will
sustain
you
in
the
way
to
power
with
a
strong
hand
and
at
the
same
time
i
promise
that
your
life
shall
be
a
continual
course
of
pleasure
honors
and
enjoyment
you
shall
never
want
for
money
you
shall
shine
you
shall
go
bravely
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
while
i
crouching
in
the
mud
will
lay
a
firm
foundation
for
the
brilliant
edifice
of
your
fortunes
for
i
love
power
for
its
own
sake
i
shall
always
rejoice
in
your
enjoyment
forbidden
to
me
in
short
my
self
shall
become
your
self
well
if
a
day
should
come
when
this
pact
between
man
and
the
tempter
this
agreement
between
the
child
and
the
diplomatist
should
no
longer
suit
your
ideas
you
can
still
look
about
for
some
quiet
spot
like
that
pool
of
which
you
were
speaking
and
drown
yourself
you
will
only
be
as
you
are
now
or
a
little
more
or
a
little
less
wretched
and
dishonored
this
is
not
like
the
archbishop
of
granada
homily
said
lucien
as
they
stopped
to
change
horses
call
this
concentrated
education
by
what
name
you
will
my
son
for
you
are
my
son
i
adopt
you
henceforth
and
shall
make
you
my
heir
it
is
the
code
of
ambition
god
elect
are
few
and
far
between
there
is
no
choice
you
must
bury
yourself
in
the
cloister
and
there
you
very
often
find
the
world
again
in
miniature
or
accept
the
code
perhaps
it
would
be
better
not
to
be
so
wise
said
lucien
trying
to
fathom
this
terrible
priest
what
rejoined
the
canon
you
begin
to
play
before
you
know
the
rules
of
the
game
and
now
you
throw
it
up
just
as
your
chances
are
best
and
you
have
a
substantial
godfather
to
back
you
and
you
do
not
even
care
to
play
a
return
match
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
you
have
no
mind
to
be
even
with
those
who
drove
you
from
paris
lucien
quivered
the
sounds
that
rang
through
every
nerve
seemed
to
come
from
some
bronze
instrument
some
chinese
gong
i
am
only
a
poor
priest
returned
his
mentor
and
a
grim
expression
dreadful
to
behold
appeared
for
a
moment
on
a
face
burned
to
a
by
the
sun
of
spain
i
am
only
a
poor
priest
but
if
i
had
been
humiliated
vexed
tormented
betrayed
and
sold
as
you
have
been
by
the
scoundrels
of
whom
you
have
told
me
i
should
do
like
an
arab
of
the
desert
i
would
devote
myself
body
and
soul
to
vengeance
i
might
end
by
dangling
from
a
gibbet
garroted
impaled
guillotined
in
your
french
fashion
i
should
not
care
a
rap
but
they
should
not
have
my
head
until
i
had
crushed
my
enemies
under
my
heel
lucien
was
silent
he
had
no
wish
to
draw
the
priest
out
any
further
some
are
descended
from
cain
and
some
from
abel
the
canon
concluded
i
myself
am
of
mixed
blood
cain
for
my
enemies
abel
for
my
friends
woe
to
him
that
shall
awaken
cain
after
all
you
are
a
frenchman
i
am
a
spaniard
and
what
is
more
a
canon
what
a
tartar
thought
lucien
scanning
the
protector
thus
sent
to
him
by
heaven
there
was
no
sign
of
the
jesuit
nor
even
of
the
ecclesiastic
about
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
his
hands
were
large
he
was
and
evidently
he
possessed
the
strength
of
a
hercules
his
terrific
expression
was
softened
by
benignity
assumed
at
will
but
a
complexion
of
impenetrable
bronze
inspired
feelings
of
repulsion
rather
than
attachment
for
the
man
the
strange
diplomatist
looked
somewhat
like
a
bishop
for
he
wore
powder
on
his
long
thick
hair
after
the
fashion
of
the
prince
de
talleyrand
a
gold
cross
hanging
from
a
strip
of
blue
ribbon
with
a
white
border
indicated
an
ecclesiastical
dignitary
the
outlines
beneath
the
black
silk
stockings
would
not
have
disgraced
an
athlete
the
exquisite
neatness
of
his
clothes
and
person
revealed
an
amount
of
care
which
a
simple
priest
and
above
all
a
spanish
priest
does
not
always
take
with
his
appearance
a
hat
lay
on
the
front
seat
of
the
carriage
which
bore
the
arms
of
spain
in
spite
of
the
sense
of
repulsion
the
effect
made
by
the
appearance
was
weakened
by
his
manner
fierce
and
yet
winning
as
it
was
he
evidently
laid
himself
out
to
please
lucien
and
the
winning
manner
became
almost
coaxing
yet
lucien
noticed
the
smallest
trifles
uneasily
he
felt
that
the
moment
of
decision
had
come
they
had
reached
the
second
stage
beyond
ruffec
and
the
decision
meant
life
or
death
the
spaniard
last
words
vibrated
through
many
chords
in
his
heart
and
to
the
shame
of
both
it
must
be
said
that
all
that
was
worst
in
lucien
responded
to
an
appeal
deliberately
made
to
his
evil
impulses
and
the
eyes
that
studied
the
poet
beautiful
face
had
read
him
very
clearly
lucien
beheld
paris
once
more
in
imagination
he
caught
again
at
the
reins
of
power
let
fall
from
his
unskilled
hands
and
he
avenged
himself
the
comparisons
which
he
himself
had
drawn
so
lately
between
the
life
of
paris
and
life
in
the
provinces
faded
from
his
mind
with
the
more
painful
motives
for
suicide
he
was
about
to
return
to
his
natural
sphere
and
this
time
with
a
protector
a
political
intriguer
unscrupulous
as
cromwell
i
was
alone
now
there
will
be
two
of
us
he
told
himself
and
then
this
priest
had
been
more
and
more
interested
as
he
told
of
his
sins
one
after
another
the
man
charity
had
grown
with
the
extent
of
his
misdoings
nothing
had
astonished
this
confessor
and
yet
what
could
be
the
motive
of
a
mover
in
the
intrigues
of
kings
lucien
at
first
was
fain
to
be
content
with
the
banal
answer
the
spanish
are
a
generous
race
the
spaniard
is
generous
even
so
the
italian
is
jealous
and
a
poisoner
the
frenchman
fickle
the
german
frank
the
jew
ignoble
and
the
englishman
noble
reverse
these
verdicts
and
you
shall
arrive
within
a
reasonable
distance
of
the
truth
the
jews
have
monopolized
the
gold
of
the
world
they
compose
the
act
sing
give
commissions
for
pictures
and
build
palaces
write
and
wonderful
verse
they
are
more
powerful
than
ever
their
religion
is
accepted
they
have
lent
money
to
the
holy
father
himself
as
for
germany
a
foreigner
is
often
asked
whether
he
has
a
contract
in
writing
and
this
is
in
the
smallest
matters
so
tricky
are
they
in
their
dealings
in
france
the
spectacle
of
national
blunders
has
never
lacked
national
applause
for
the
past
fifty
years
we
continue
to
wear
hats
which
no
mortal
can
explain
and
every
change
of
government
is
made
on
the
express
condition
that
things
shall
remain
exactly
as
they
were
before
england
flaunts
her
perfidy
in
the
face
of
the
world
and
her
abominable
treachery
is
only
equaled
by
her
greed
all
the
gold
of
two
indies
passed
through
the
hands
of
spain
and
now
she
has
nothing
left
there
is
no
country
in
the
world
where
poison
is
so
little
in
request
as
in
italy
no
country
where
manners
are
easier
or
more
gentle
as
for
the
spaniard
he
has
traded
largely
on
the
reputation
of
the
moor
as
the
canon
of
toledo
returned
to
the
caleche
he
had
spoken
a
word
to
the
drive
he
said
and
there
will
be
three
francs
for
for
you
then
seeing
that
lucien
hesitated
come
come
he
exclaimed
and
lucien
took
his
place
again
telling
himself
that
he
meant
to
try
the
effect
of
the
ad
father
he
began
after
pouring
out
with
all
the
coolness
in
the
world
a
series
of
maxims
which
the
vulgar
would
consider
profoundly
immoral
and
so
they
are
said
the
priest
that
is
why
jesus
christ
said
that
it
must
needs
be
that
offences
come
my
son
and
that
is
why
the
world
displays
such
horror
of
offences
a
man
of
your
stamp
will
not
be
surprised
by
the
question
which
i
am
about
to
ask
indeed
my
son
you
do
not
know
me
said
carlos
herrera
do
you
suppose
that
i
should
engage
a
secretary
unless
i
knew
that
i
could
depend
upon
his
principles
sufficiently
to
be
sure
that
he
would
not
rob
me
i
like
you
you
are
as
innocent
in
every
way
as
a
suicide
your
question
why
do
you
take
an
interest
in
me
what
price
do
you
set
on
my
obedience
why
should
you
give
me
everything
what
is
your
share
the
spaniard
looked
at
lucien
and
a
smile
came
over
his
face
let
us
wait
till
we
come
to
the
next
hill
we
can
walk
up
and
talk
out
in
the
open
the
back
seat
of
a
traveling
carriage
is
not
the
place
for
confidences
they
traveled
in
silence
for
sometime
the
rapidity
of
the
movement
seemed
to
increase
lucien
moral
intoxication
here
is
a
hill
father
he
said
at
last
awakening
from
a
kind
of
dream
very
well
we
will
walk
the
abbe
called
to
the
postilion
to
stop
and
the
two
sprang
out
upon
the
road
you
child
said
the
spaniard
taking
lucien
by
the
arm
have
you
ever
thought
over
otway
did
you
understand
the
profound
friendship
between
man
and
man
which
binds
pierre
and
jaffier
each
to
each
so
closely
that
a
woman
is
as
nothing
in
comparison
and
all
social
conditions
are
changed
well
so
much
for
the
poet
so
the
canon
knows
something
of
the
drama
thought
lucien
have
you
read
voltaire
he
asked
i
have
done
better
said
the
other
i
put
his
doctrine
in
practice
you
do
not
believe
in
god
come
it
is
i
who
am
the
atheist
is
it
the
abbe
said
smiling
let
us
come
to
practical
matters
my
child
he
added
putting
an
arm
round
lucien
waist
i
am
years
old
i
am
the
natural
son
of
a
great
lord
consequently
i
have
no
family
and
i
have
a
heart
but
learn
this
carve
it
on
that
still
so
soft
brain
of
yours
man
dreads
to
be
alone
and
of
all
kinds
of
isolation
inward
isolation
is
the
most
appalling
the
early
anchorite
lived
with
god
he
dwelt
in
the
spirit
world
the
most
populous
world
of
all
the
miser
lives
in
a
world
of
imagination
and
fruition
his
whole
life
and
all
that
he
is
even
his
sex
lies
in
his
brain
a
man
first
thought
be
he
leper
or
convict
hopelessly
sick
or
degraded
is
to
find
another
with
a
like
fate
to
share
it
with
him
he
will
exert
the
utmost
that
is
in
him
every
power
all
his
vital
energy
to
satisfy
that
craving
it
is
his
very
life
but
for
that
tyrannous
longing
would
satan
have
found
companions
there
is
a
whole
poem
yet
to
be
written
a
first
part
of
milton
poem
is
only
the
apology
for
the
revolt
it
would
be
the
iliad
of
corruption
said
lucien
well
i
am
alone
i
live
alone
if
i
wear
the
priest
habit
i
have
not
a
priest
heart
i
like
to
devote
myself
to
some
one
that
is
my
weakness
that
is
my
life
that
is
how
i
came
to
be
a
priest
i
am
not
afraid
of
ingratitude
and
i
am
grateful
the
church
is
nothing
to
me
it
is
an
idea
i
am
devoted
to
the
king
of
spain
but
you
can
not
give
affection
to
a
king
of
spain
he
is
my
protector
he
towers
above
me
i
want
to
love
my
creature
to
mould
him
fashion
him
to
my
use
and
love
him
as
a
father
loves
his
child
i
shall
drive
in
your
tilbury
my
boy
enjoy
your
success
with
women
and
say
to
myself
fine
young
fellow
this
marquis
de
rubempre
my
creation
whom
i
have
brought
into
this
great
world
is
my
very
self
his
greatness
is
my
doing
he
speaks
or
is
silent
with
my
voice
he
consults
me
in
everything
the
abbe
de
vermont
felt
thus
for
he
led
her
to
the
scaffold
he
did
not
love
the
queen
said
the
priest
he
only
loved
the
abbe
de
vermont
must
i
leave
desolation
behind
me
i
have
money
you
shall
draw
on
me
i
would
do
a
great
deal
just
now
to
rescue
david
sechard
said
lucien
in
the
tone
of
one
who
has
given
up
all
idea
of
suicide
say
but
one
word
my
son
and
by
morning
he
shall
have
money
enough
to
set
him
free
what
would
you
give
me
twelve
thousand
francs
ah
child
do
you
not
see
that
we
are
traveling
on
at
the
rate
of
four
leagues
an
hour
we
shall
dine
at
poitiers
before
long
and
there
if
you
decide
to
sign
the
pact
to
give
me
a
single
proof
of
obedience
a
great
proof
that
i
shall
require
then
the
bordeaux
coach
shall
carry
fifteen
thousand
francs
to
your
sister
where
is
the
money
the
spaniard
made
no
answer
and
lucien
said
within
himself
there
i
had
him
he
was
laughing
at
me
in
another
moment
they
took
their
places
neither
of
them
said
a
word
silently
the
abbe
groped
in
the
pocket
of
the
coach
and
drew
out
a
traveler
leather
pouch
with
three
divisions
in
it
thence
he
took
a
hundred
portuguese
moidores
bringing
out
his
large
hand
filled
with
gold
three
times
father
i
am
yours
said
lucien
dazzled
by
the
stream
of
gold
child
said
the
priest
and
set
a
tender
kiss
on
lucien
forehead
there
is
twice
as
much
still
left
in
the
bag
besides
the
money
for
traveling
expenses
and
you
are
traveling
alone
cried
lucien
what
is
that
asked
the
spaniard
i
have
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
in
drafts
on
paris
a
diplomatist
without
money
is
in
your
position
of
this
morning
a
poet
without
a
will
of
his
own
as
lucien
took
his
place
in
the
caleche
beside
the
spanish
diplomatist
eve
rose
to
give
her
child
a
draught
of
milk
found
the
fatal
letter
in
the
cradle
and
read
it
a
sudden
cold
chilled
the
damps
of
morning
slumber
dizziness
came
over
her
she
could
not
see
she
called
aloud
to
marion
and
kolb
has
my
brother
gone
out
she
asked
and
kolb
answered
at
once
with
yes
montame
pefore
tay
keep
this
that
i
am
going
to
tell
you
a
profound
secret
said
eve
my
brother
has
gone
no
doubt
to
make
away
with
himself
hurry
both
of
you
make
inquiries
cautiously
and
look
along
the
river
eve
was
left
alone
in
a
dull
stupor
dreadful
to
see
her
trouble
was
at
its
height
when
came
in
at
seven
to
talk
over
the
steps
to
be
taken
in
david
case
at
such
a
time
any
voice
in
the
world
may
speak
and
we
let
them
speak
our
poor
dear
david
is
in
prison
madame
so
began
i
foresaw
all
along
that
it
would
end
in
this
i
advised
him
at
the
time
to
go
into
partnership
with
his
competitors
the
cointets
for
while
your
husband
has
simply
the
idea
they
have
the
means
of
putting
it
into
practical
shape
so
as
soon
as
i
heard
of
his
arrest
yesterday
evening
what
did
i
do
but
hurry
away
to
find
the
cointets
and
try
to
obtain
such
concessions
as
might
satisfy
you
if
you
try
to
keep
the
discovery
to
yourselves
you
will
continue
to
live
a
life
of
shifts
and
chicanery
you
must
give
in
or
else
when
you
are
exhausted
and
at
the
last
gasp
you
will
end
by
making
a
bargain
with
some
capitalist
or
other
and
perhaps
to
your
own
detriment
whereas
i
hope
to
see
you
make
a
good
one
with
mm
cointet
in
this
way
you
will
save
yourselves
the
hardships
and
the
misery
of
the
inventor
duel
with
the
greed
of
the
capitalist
and
the
indifference
of
the
public
let
us
see
if
the
mm
cointet
should
pay
your
debts
if
over
and
above
your
debts
they
should
pay
you
a
further
sum
of
money
down
whether
or
no
the
invention
succeeds
while
at
the
same
time
it
is
thoroughly
understood
that
if
it
succeeds
a
certain
proportion
of
the
profits
of
working
the
patent
shall
be
yours
would
you
not
be
doing
very
well
you
yourself
madame
would
then
be
the
proprietor
of
the
plant
in
the
you
would
sell
the
business
no
doubt
it
is
quite
worth
twenty
thousand
francs
i
will
undertake
to
find
you
a
buyer
at
that
price
now
if
you
draw
up
a
deed
of
partnership
with
the
mm
cointet
and
receive
fifteen
thousand
francs
of
capital
and
if
you
invest
it
in
the
funds
at
the
present
moment
it
will
bring
you
in
an
income
of
two
thousand
francs
you
can
live
on
two
thousand
francs
in
the
provinces
bear
in
mind
too
madame
that
given
certain
contingencies
there
will
be
yet
further
payments
i
say
because
we
must
lay
our
accounts
with
failure
very
well
continued
now
these
things
i
am
sure
that
i
can
obtain
for
you
first
of
all
david
release
from
prison
secondly
fifteen
thousand
francs
a
premium
paid
on
his
discovery
whether
the
experiments
fail
or
succeed
and
lastly
a
partnership
between
david
and
the
mm
cointet
to
be
taken
out
after
private
experiment
made
jointly
the
deed
of
partnership
for
the
working
of
the
patent
should
be
drawn
up
on
the
following
basis
the
mm
cointet
to
bear
all
the
expenses
the
capital
invested
by
david
to
be
confined
to
the
expenses
of
procuring
the
patent
and
his
share
of
the
profits
to
be
fixed
at
per
cent
you
are
a
and
very
sensible
woman
qualities
which
are
not
often
found
combined
with
great
beauty
think
over
these
proposals
and
you
will
see
that
they
are
very
favorable
poor
eve
in
her
despair
burst
into
tears
ah
sir
why
did
you
not
come
yesterday
evening
to
tell
me
this
we
should
have
been
spared
disgrace
and
and
something
far
worse
i
was
talking
with
the
cointets
until
midnight
they
are
behind
metivier
as
you
must
have
suspected
but
how
has
something
worse
than
our
poor
david
arrest
happened
since
yesterday
evening
here
is
the
awful
news
that
i
found
when
i
awoke
this
morning
she
said
holding
out
lucien
letter
you
have
just
given
me
proof
of
your
interest
in
us
you
are
david
friend
and
lucien
i
need
not
ask
you
to
keep
the
secret
you
need
not
feel
the
least
anxiety
said
as
he
returned
the
letter
lucien
will
not
take
his
life
your
arrest
was
his
doing
he
was
obliged
to
find
some
excuse
for
leaving
you
and
this
exit
of
his
looks
to
me
like
a
piece
of
stage
business
the
cointets
had
gained
their
ends
they
had
tormented
the
inventor
and
his
family
until
worn
out
by
the
torture
the
victims
longed
for
a
respite
and
then
seized
their
opportunity
and
made
the
offer
not
every
inventor
has
the
tenacity
of
the
that
will
perish
with
his
teeth
fast
set
in
his
capture
the
cointets
had
shrewdly
estimated
david
character
the
tall
cointet
looked
upon
david
imprisonment
as
the
first
scene
of
the
first
act
of
the
drama
the
second
act
opened
with
the
proposal
which
had
just
made
as
the
attorney
looked
upon
lucien
frantic
folly
as
a
bit
of
luck
a
chance
that
would
finally
decide
the
issues
of
the
day
eve
was
completely
prostrated
by
this
event
saw
this
and
meant
to
profit
by
her
despair
to
win
her
confidence
for
he
saw
at
last
how
much
she
influenced
her
husband
so
far
from
discouraging
eve
he
tried
to
reassure
her
and
very
cleverly
diverted
her
thoughts
to
the
prison
she
should
persuade
david
to
take
the
cointets
into
partnership
david
told
me
madame
that
he
only
wished
for
a
fortune
for
your
sake
and
your
brother
but
it
should
be
clear
to
you
by
now
that
to
try
to
make
a
rich
man
of
lucien
would
be
madness
the
youngster
would
run
through
three
fortunes
eve
attitude
told
plainly
enough
that
she
had
no
more
illusions
left
with
regard
to
her
brother
the
lawyer
waited
a
little
so
that
her
silence
should
have
the
weight
of
consent
things
being
so
it
is
now
a
question
of
you
and
your
child
he
said
it
rests
with
you
to
decide
whether
an
income
of
two
thousand
francs
will
be
enough
for
your
welfare
to
say
nothing
of
old
sechard
property
your
income
has
amounted
to
seven
or
eight
thousand
francs
for
a
long
time
past
to
say
nothing
of
capital
lying
out
at
interest
so
after
all
you
have
a
good
prospect
before
you
why
torment
yourself
left
eve
sechard
to
reflect
upon
this
prospect
the
whole
scheme
had
been
drawn
up
with
no
little
skill
by
the
tall
cointet
the
evening
before
give
them
the
glimpse
of
a
possibility
of
money
in
hand
the
lynx
had
said
when
brought
the
news
of
the
arrest
once
let
them
grow
accustomed
to
that
idea
and
they
are
ours
we
will
drive
a
bargain
and
little
by
little
we
shall
bring
them
down
to
our
price
for
the
secret
the
argument
of
the
second
act
of
the
commercial
drama
was
in
a
manner
summed
up
in
that
speech
mme
sechard
heartbroken
and
full
of
dread
for
her
brother
fate
dressed
and
came
downstairs
an
agony
of
terror
seized
her
when
she
thought
that
she
must
cross
angouleme
alone
on
the
way
to
the
prison
gave
little
thought
to
his
fair
client
distress
when
he
came
back
to
offer
his
arm
it
was
from
a
tolerably
machiavellian
motive
but
eve
gave
him
credit
for
delicate
consideration
and
he
allowed
her
to
thank
him
for
it
the
little
attention
at
such
a
moment
from
so
hard
a
man
modified
mme
sechard
previous
opinion
of
i
am
taking
you
round
by
the
longest
way
he
said
and
we
shall
meet
nobody
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
monsieur
i
feel
that
i
have
no
right
to
hold
up
my
head
before
other
people
i
had
a
sharp
lesson
given
to
me
last
night
it
will
be
the
first
and
the
last
oh
i
certainly
shall
not
stay
in
the
town
now
let
me
know
if
your
husband
consents
to
the
proposals
that
are
all
but
definitely
offered
by
the
cointets
said
at
the
gate
of
the
prison
i
will
come
at
once
with
an
order
for
david
release
from
cachan
and
in
all
likelihood
he
will
not
go
back
again
to
prison
this
suggestion
made
on
the
very
threshold
of
the
jail
was
a
piece
of
cunning
strategy
a
as
the
italians
call
an
indefinable
mixture
of
treachery
and
truth
a
cunningly
planned
fraud
which
does
not
break
the
letter
of
the
law
or
a
piece
of
deft
trickery
for
which
there
is
no
legal
remedy
bartholomew
for
instance
was
a
political
combination
imprisonment
for
debt
for
reasons
previously
explained
is
such
a
rare
occurrence
in
the
provinces
that
there
is
no
house
of
detention
and
a
debtor
is
perforce
imprisoned
with
the
accused
convicted
and
condemned
the
three
graduated
subdivisions
of
the
class
generically
styled
criminal
david
was
put
for
the
time
being
in
a
cell
on
the
ground
floor
from
which
some
prisoner
had
probably
been
recently
discharged
at
the
end
of
his
time
once
inscribed
on
the
register
with
the
amount
allowed
by
the
law
for
a
prisoner
board
for
one
month
david
confronted
a
big
stout
man
more
powerful
than
the
king
himself
in
a
prisoner
eyes
this
was
the
jailer
an
instance
of
a
thin
jailer
is
unknown
in
the
provinces
the
place
to
begin
with
is
almost
a
sinecure
and
a
jailer
is
a
kind
of
innkeeper
who
pays
no
rent
and
lives
very
well
while
his
prisoners
fare
very
ill
for
like
an
innkeeper
he
gives
them
rooms
according
to
their
payments
he
knew
david
by
name
and
what
was
more
knew
about
david
father
and
thought
that
he
might
venture
to
let
the
printer
have
a
good
room
on
credit
for
one
night
for
david
was
penniless
the
prison
of
angouleme
was
built
in
the
middle
ages
and
has
no
more
changed
than
the
old
cathedral
it
is
built
against
the
old
or
ancient
court
of
appeal
and
people
still
call
it
the
de
it
boasts
the
conventional
prison
gateway
the
door
the
low
worn
archway
which
the
better
deserves
the
qualification
cyclopean
because
the
jailer
peephole
or
looks
out
like
a
single
eye
from
the
front
of
the
building
as
you
enter
you
find
yourself
in
a
corridor
which
runs
across
the
entire
width
of
the
building
with
a
row
of
doors
of
cells
that
give
upon
the
prison
yard
and
are
lighted
by
high
windows
covered
with
a
square
iron
grating
the
jailer
house
is
separated
from
these
cells
by
an
archway
in
the
middle
through
which
you
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
iron
gate
of
the
prison
yard
the
jailer
installed
david
in
a
cell
next
to
the
archway
thinking
that
he
would
like
to
have
a
man
of
stamp
as
a
near
neighbor
for
the
sake
of
company
this
is
the
best
room
he
said
david
was
struck
dumb
with
amazement
at
the
sight
of
it
the
stone
walls
were
tolerably
damp
the
windows
set
high
in
the
wall
were
heavily
barred
the
floor
was
cold
as
ice
and
from
the
corridor
outside
came
the
sound
of
the
measured
tramp
of
the
warder
monotonous
as
waves
on
the
beach
you
are
a
prisoner
you
are
watched
and
guarded
said
the
footsteps
at
every
moment
of
every
hour
all
these
small
things
together
produce
a
prodigious
effect
upon
the
minds
of
honest
folk
david
saw
that
the
bed
was
execrable
but
the
first
night
in
a
prison
is
full
of
violent
agitation
and
only
on
the
second
night
does
the
prisoner
notice
that
his
couch
is
hard
the
jailer
was
graciously
disposed
he
naturally
suggested
that
his
prisoner
should
walk
in
the
yard
until
nightfall
david
hour
of
anguish
only
began
when
he
was
locked
into
his
cell
for
the
night
lights
are
not
allowed
in
the
cells
a
prisoner
detained
on
arrest
used
to
be
subjected
to
rules
devised
for
malefactors
unless
he
brought
a
special
exemption
signed
by
the
public
prosecutor
the
jailer
certainly
might
allow
david
to
sit
by
his
fire
but
the
prisoner
must
go
back
to
his
cell
at
time
poor
david
learned
the
horrors
of
prison
life
by
experience
the
rough
coarseness
of
the
treatment
revolted
him
yet
a
revulsion
familiar
to
those
who
live
by
thought
passed
over
him
he
detached
himself
from
his
loneliness
and
found
a
way
of
escape
in
a
waking
dream
at
last
the
unhappy
man
thoughts
turned
to
his
own
affairs
the
stimulating
influence
of
a
prison
upon
conscience
and
is
immense
david
asked
himself
whether
he
had
done
his
duty
as
the
head
of
a
family
what
despairing
grief
his
wife
must
feel
at
this
moment
why
had
he
not
done
as
marion
had
said
and
earned
money
enough
to
pursue
his
investigations
at
leisure
how
can
i
stay
in
angouleme
after
such
a
disgrace
and
when
i
come
out
of
prison
what
will
become
of
us
where
shall
we
go
doubts
as
to
his
process
began
to
occur
to
him
and
he
passed
through
an
agony
which
none
save
inventors
can
understand
going
from
doubt
to
doubt
david
began
to
see
his
real
position
more
clearly
and
to
himself
he
said
as
the
cointets
had
said
to
old
sechard
as
had
just
said
to
eve
suppose
that
all
should
go
well
what
does
it
amount
to
in
practice
the
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
take
out
a
patent
and
money
is
needed
for
that
and
experiments
must
be
tried
on
a
large
scale
in
a
which
means
that
the
discovery
must
pass
into
other
hands
oh
was
right
a
very
vivid
light
sometimes
dawns
in
the
darkest
prison
pshaw
said
david
i
shall
see
no
doubt
and
he
turned
and
slept
on
the
filthy
mattress
covered
with
coarse
brown
sacking
so
when
eve
unconsciously
played
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
that
morning
she
found
her
husband
more
than
ready
to
listen
to
proposals
she
put
her
arms
about
him
and
kissed
him
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
for
there
was
but
one
chair
of
the
poorest
and
commonest
kind
in
the
cell
her
eyes
fell
on
the
unsightly
pail
in
a
corner
and
over
the
walls
covered
with
inscriptions
left
by
david
predecessors
and
tears
filled
the
eyes
that
were
red
with
weeping
she
had
sobbed
long
and
very
bitterly
but
the
sight
of
her
husband
in
a
felon
cell
drew
fresh
tears
and
the
desire
of
fame
may
lead
one
to
this
she
cried
oh
my
angel
give
up
your
career
let
us
walk
together
along
the
beaten
track
we
will
not
try
to
make
haste
to
be
rich
david
i
need
very
little
to
be
very
happy
especially
now
after
all
that
we
have
been
through
and
if
you
only
knew
the
disgrace
of
arrest
is
not
the
worst
look
she
held
out
lucien
letter
and
when
david
had
read
it
she
tried
to
comfort
him
by
repeating
bitter
comment
if
lucien
has
taken
his
life
the
thing
is
done
by
now
said
david
if
he
has
not
made
away
with
himself
by
this
time
he
will
not
kill
himself
as
he
himself
says
courage
can
not
last
longer
than
a
morning
but
the
suspense
cried
eve
forgiving
almost
everything
at
the
thought
of
death
then
she
told
her
husband
of
the
proposals
which
professed
to
have
received
from
the
cointets
david
accepted
them
at
once
with
manifest
pleasure
we
shall
have
enough
to
live
upon
in
a
village
near
where
the
cointets
stands
i
want
nothing
now
but
a
quiet
life
said
david
if
lucien
has
punished
himself
by
death
we
can
wait
so
long
as
father
lives
and
if
lucien
is
still
living
poor
fellow
he
will
learn
to
adapt
himself
to
our
narrow
ways
the
cointets
certainly
will
make
money
by
my
discovery
but
after
all
what
am
i
compared
with
our
country
one
man
in
it
that
is
all
and
if
the
whole
country
is
benefited
i
shall
be
content
there
dear
eve
neither
you
nor
i
were
meant
to
be
successful
in
business
we
do
not
care
enough
about
making
a
profit
we
have
not
the
dogged
objection
to
parting
with
our
money
even
when
it
is
legally
owing
which
is
a
kind
of
virtue
of
the
for
these
two
sorts
of
avarice
are
called
prudence
and
a
faculty
of
business
eve
felt
overjoyed
she
and
her
husband
held
the
same
views
and
this
is
one
of
the
sweetest
flowers
of
love
for
two
human
beings
who
love
each
other
may
not
be
of
the
same
mind
nor
take
the
same
view
of
their
interests
she
wrote
to
telling
him
that
they
both
consented
to
the
general
scheme
and
asked
him
to
release
david
then
she
begged
the
jailer
to
deliver
the
message
ten
minutes
later
entered
the
dismal
place
go
home
madame
he
said
addressing
eve
we
will
follow
well
my
dear
friend
turning
to
david
so
you
allowed
them
to
catch
you
why
did
you
come
out
how
came
you
to
make
such
a
mistake
eh
how
could
i
do
otherwise
look
at
this
letter
that
lucien
wrote
david
held
out
a
sheet
of
paper
it
was
cerizet
forged
letter
read
it
looked
at
it
fingered
the
paper
as
he
talked
and
still
taking
presently
as
if
through
absence
of
mind
folded
it
up
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
then
he
linked
his
arm
in
david
and
they
went
out
together
the
order
for
release
having
come
during
the
conversation
it
was
like
heaven
to
david
to
be
at
home
again
he
cried
like
a
child
when
he
took
little
lucien
in
his
arms
and
looked
round
his
room
after
three
weeks
of
imprisonment
and
the
disgrace
according
to
provincial
notions
of
the
last
few
hours
kolb
and
marion
had
come
back
marion
had
heard
in
that
lucien
had
been
seen
walking
along
on
the
paris
road
somewhere
beyond
marsac
some
country
folk
coming
in
to
market
had
noticed
his
fine
clothes
kolb
therefore
had
set
out
on
horseback
along
the
highroad
and
heard
at
last
at
mansle
that
lucien
was
traveling
post
in
a
caleche
marron
had
recognized
him
as
he
passed
what
did
i
tell
you
said
that
fellow
is
not
a
poet
he
is
a
romance
in
heaven
knows
how
many
chapters
traveling
post
repeated
eve
where
can
he
be
going
this
time
now
go
to
see
the
cointets
they
are
expecting
you
said
turning
to
david
ah
monsieur
cried
the
beautiful
eve
pray
do
your
best
for
our
interests
our
whole
future
lies
in
your
hands
if
you
prefer
it
madame
the
conference
can
be
held
here
i
will
leave
david
with
you
the
cointets
will
come
this
evening
and
you
shall
see
if
i
can
defend
your
interests
ah
monsieur
i
should
be
very
glad
said
eve
very
well
said
this
evening
at
seven
thank
you
said
eve
and
from
her
tone
and
glance
knew
that
he
had
made
great
progress
in
his
fair
client
confidence
you
have
nothing
to
fear
you
see
i
was
right
he
added
your
brother
is
a
hundred
miles
away
from
suicide
and
when
all
comes
to
all
perhaps
you
will
have
a
little
fortune
this
evening
a
purchaser
for
the
business
has
turned
up
if
that
is
the
case
said
eve
why
should
we
not
wait
awhile
before
binding
ourselves
to
the
cointets
saw
the
danger
you
are
forgetting
madame
he
said
that
you
can
not
sell
your
business
until
you
have
paid
metivier
for
a
distress
warrant
has
been
issued
as
soon
as
reached
home
he
sent
for
cerizet
and
when
the
printer
foreman
appeared
drew
him
into
the
embrasure
of
the
window
evening
he
said
you
will
be
the
proprietor
of
the
sechards
and
then
there
are
those
behind
you
who
have
influence
enough
to
transfer
the
license
then
in
a
lowered
voice
but
you
have
no
mind
to
end
in
the
hulks
i
suppose
the
hulks
what
that
what
that
your
letter
to
david
was
a
forgery
it
is
in
my
possession
what
would
henriette
say
in
a
court
of
law
i
do
not
want
to
ruin
you
he
added
hastily
seeing
how
white
cerizet
face
grew
you
want
something
more
of
me
cried
cerizet
well
here
it
is
said
follow
me
carefully
you
will
be
a
master
printer
in
angouleme
in
two
months
time
but
you
will
not
have
paid
for
your
business
you
will
not
pay
for
it
in
ten
years
you
will
work
a
long
while
yet
for
those
that
have
lent
you
the
money
and
you
will
be
the
of
the
liberal
party
now
shall
draw
up
your
agreement
with
gannerac
and
i
can
draw
it
up
in
such
a
way
that
you
will
have
the
business
in
your
own
hands
one
of
these
days
but
if
the
liberals
start
a
paper
if
you
bring
it
out
and
if
i
am
deputy
public
prosecutor
then
you
will
come
to
an
understanding
with
the
cointets
and
publish
articles
of
such
a
nature
that
they
will
have
the
paper
suppressed
the
cointets
will
pay
you
handsomely
for
that
service
i
know
of
course
that
you
will
be
a
hero
a
victim
of
persecution
you
will
be
a
personage
among
the
liberals
a
sergeant
mercier
a
courier
a
manual
on
a
small
scale
i
will
take
care
that
they
leave
you
your
license
in
fact
on
the
day
when
the
newspaper
is
suppressed
i
will
burn
this
letter
before
your
eyes
your
fortune
will
not
cost
you
much
a
working
man
has
the
haziest
notions
as
to
the
law
with
regard
to
forgery
and
cerizet
who
beheld
himself
already
in
the
dock
breathed
again
in
three
years
time
continued
i
shall
be
public
prosecutor
in
angouleme
you
may
have
need
of
me
some
day
bear
that
in
mind
it
agreed
said
cerizet
but
you
do
know
me
burn
that
letter
now
and
trust
to
my
gratitude
looked
cerizet
in
the
face
it
was
a
duel
in
which
one
man
gaze
is
a
scalpel
with
which
he
essays
to
probe
the
soul
of
another
and
the
eyes
of
that
other
are
a
theatre
as
it
were
to
which
all
his
virtue
is
summoned
for
display
did
not
utter
a
word
he
lighted
a
taper
and
burned
the
letter
he
has
his
way
to
make
he
said
to
himself
here
is
one
that
will
go
through
fire
and
water
for
you
said
cerizet
david
awaited
the
interview
with
the
cointets
with
a
vague
feeling
of
uneasiness
not
however
on
account
of
the
proposed
partnership
nor
for
his
own
interests
he
felt
nervous
as
to
their
opinion
of
his
work
he
was
in
something
the
same
position
as
a
dramatic
author
before
his
judges
the
inventor
pride
in
the
discovery
so
nearly
completed
left
no
room
for
any
other
feelings
at
seven
that
evening
while
mme
du
chatelet
pleading
a
sick
headache
had
gone
to
her
room
in
her
unhappiness
over
the
rumors
of
lucien
departure
while
de
comte
left
to
himself
was
entertaining
his
guests
at
dinner
the
tall
cointet
and
his
stout
brother
accompanied
by
opened
negotiations
with
the
competitor
who
had
delivered
himself
up
bound
hand
and
foot
a
difficulty
awaited
them
at
the
outset
how
was
it
possible
to
draw
up
a
deed
of
partnership
unless
they
knew
david
secret
and
if
david
divulged
his
secret
he
would
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
cointets
arranged
that
the
deed
of
partnership
should
be
the
first
drawn
up
thereupon
the
tall
cointet
asked
to
see
some
specimens
of
david
work
and
david
brought
out
the
last
sheet
that
he
had
made
guaranteeing
the
price
of
production
well
said
there
you
have
the
basis
of
the
agreement
ready
made
you
can
go
into
partnership
on
the
strength
of
those
samples
inserting
a
clause
to
protect
yourselves
in
case
the
conditions
of
the
patent
are
not
fulfilled
in
the
manufacturing
process
it
is
one
thing
to
make
samples
of
paper
on
a
small
scale
in
your
own
room
with
a
small
mould
monsieur
and
another
to
turn
out
a
quantity
said
the
tall
cointet
addressing
david
quite
another
thing
as
you
may
judge
from
this
single
fact
we
manufacture
colored
papers
we
buy
parcels
of
coloring
absolutely
identical
every
cake
of
indigo
used
for
our
is
taken
from
a
batch
supplied
by
the
same
maker
well
we
have
never
yet
been
able
to
obtain
two
batches
of
precisely
the
same
shade
there
are
variations
in
the
material
which
we
can
not
detect
the
quantity
and
the
quality
of
the
pulp
modify
every
question
at
once
suppose
that
you
have
in
a
caldron
a
quantity
of
ingredients
of
some
kind
i
do
ask
to
know
what
they
are
you
can
do
as
you
like
with
them
the
treatment
can
be
uniformly
applied
you
can
manipulate
knead
and
pestle
the
mass
at
your
pleasure
until
you
have
a
homogeneous
substance
but
who
will
guarantee
that
it
will
be
the
same
with
a
batch
of
five
hundred
reams
and
that
your
plan
will
succeed
in
bulk
david
eve
and
looked
at
one
another
their
eyes
said
many
things
take
a
somewhat
similar
case
continued
the
tall
cointet
after
a
pause
you
cut
two
or
three
trusses
of
meadow
hay
and
store
it
in
a
loft
before
heat
is
out
of
the
grass
as
the
peasants
say
the
hay
ferments
but
no
harm
comes
of
it
you
follow
up
your
experiment
by
storing
a
couple
of
thousand
trusses
in
a
wooden
barn
and
of
course
the
hay
smoulders
and
the
barn
blazes
up
like
a
lighted
match
you
are
an
educated
man
continued
cointet
you
can
see
the
application
for
yourself
so
far
you
have
only
cut
your
two
trusses
of
hay
we
are
afraid
of
setting
fire
to
our
by
bringing
in
a
couple
of
thousand
trusses
in
other
words
we
may
spoil
more
than
one
batch
make
heavy
losses
and
find
ourselves
none
the
better
for
laying
out
a
good
deal
of
money
david
was
completely
floored
by
this
reasoning
practical
wisdom
spoke
in
language
to
theory
whose
word
is
always
for
the
future
devil
fetch
me
if
i
sign
such
a
deed
of
partnership
the
stout
cointet
cried
bluntly
you
may
throw
away
your
money
if
you
like
boniface
as
for
me
i
shall
keep
mine
here
is
my
offer
to
pay
sechard
debts
six
thousand
francs
and
another
three
thousand
francs
in
bills
at
twelve
and
fifteen
months
he
added
that
will
be
quite
enough
risk
to
we
have
a
balance
of
twelve
thousand
francs
against
metivier
that
will
make
fifteen
thousand
that
is
all
that
i
would
pay
for
the
secret
if
i
were
going
to
exploit
it
for
myself
so
this
is
the
great
discovery
that
you
were
talking
about
boniface
many
thanks
i
thought
you
had
more
sense
no
you
call
this
business
the
question
for
you
said
undismayed
by
the
explosion
resolves
itself
into
this
you
care
to
risk
twenty
thousand
francs
to
buy
a
secret
that
may
make
rich
men
of
you
why
the
risk
usually
is
in
proportion
to
the
profit
gentlemen
you
stake
twenty
thousand
francs
on
your
luck
a
gambler
puts
down
a
louis
at
roulette
for
a
chance
of
winning
but
he
knows
that
the
louis
is
lost
do
the
same
i
must
have
time
to
think
it
over
said
the
stout
cointet
i
am
not
so
clever
as
my
brother
i
am
a
plain
sort
of
chap
that
only
knows
one
thing
how
to
print
at
twenty
sous
and
sell
them
for
two
francs
where
i
see
an
invention
that
has
only
been
tried
once
i
see
ruin
you
succeed
with
the
first
batch
you
spoil
the
next
you
go
on
and
you
are
drawn
in
for
once
put
an
arm
into
that
machinery
the
rest
of
you
follows
and
he
related
an
anecdote
very
much
to
the
point
how
a
bordeaux
merchant
had
ruined
himself
by
following
a
scientific
man
advice
and
trying
to
bring
the
landes
into
cultivation
and
followed
up
the
tale
with
similar
instances
of
agricultural
and
commercial
failures
nearer
home
in
the
departments
of
the
charente
and
dordogne
he
waxed
warm
over
his
recitals
he
would
not
listen
to
another
word
demurs
so
far
from
soothing
the
stout
cointet
appeared
to
irritate
him
i
would
rather
give
more
for
a
certainty
if
i
made
only
a
small
profit
on
it
he
said
looking
at
his
brother
it
is
my
opinion
that
things
have
gone
far
enough
for
business
he
concluded
still
you
came
here
for
something
did
you
asked
what
is
your
offer
i
offer
to
release
sechard
and
if
his
plan
succeeds
to
give
him
thirty
per
cent
of
the
profits
the
stout
cointet
answered
briskly
but
monsieur
objected
eve
how
should
we
live
while
the
experiments
were
being
made
my
husband
has
endured
the
disgrace
of
imprisonment
already
he
may
as
well
go
back
to
prison
it
makes
no
difference
now
and
we
will
pay
our
debts
ourselves
laid
a
finger
on
his
lips
in
warning
you
are
unreasonable
said
he
addressing
the
brothers
you
have
seen
the
paper
sechard
father
told
you
that
he
had
shut
his
son
up
and
that
he
had
made
capital
paper
in
a
single
night
from
materials
that
must
have
cost
a
mere
nothing
you
are
here
to
make
an
offer
are
you
purchasers
yes
or
no
stay
said
the
tall
cointet
whether
my
brother
is
willing
or
no
i
will
risk
this
much
myself
i
will
pay
sechard
debts
i
will
pay
six
thousand
francs
over
and
above
the
debts
and
sechard
shall
have
thirty
per
cent
of
the
profits
but
mind
this
if
in
the
space
of
one
year
he
fails
to
carry
out
the
undertakings
which
he
himself
will
make
in
the
deed
of
partnership
he
must
return
the
six
thousand
francs
and
we
shall
keep
the
patent
and
extricate
ourselves
as
best
we
may
are
you
sure
of
yourself
asked
taking
david
aside
yes
said
david
he
was
deceived
by
the
tactics
of
the
brothers
and
afraid
lest
the
stout
cointet
should
break
off
the
negotiations
on
which
his
future
depended
very
well
i
will
draft
the
deed
said
addressing
the
rest
of
the
party
each
of
you
shall
have
a
copy
and
you
will
have
all
morning
in
which
to
think
it
over
afternoon
at
four
when
the
court
rises
you
will
sign
the
agreement
you
gentlemen
will
withdraw
metivier
suit
and
i
for
my
part
will
write
to
stop
proceedings
in
the
we
will
give
notice
on
either
side
that
the
affair
has
been
settled
out
of
court
david
sechard
undertakings
were
thus
worded
in
the
deed
david
sechard
printer
of
angouleme
affirming
that
he
has
discovered
a
method
of
sizing
in
the
vat
and
also
a
method
of
affecting
a
reduction
of
fifty
per
cent
in
the
price
of
all
kinds
of
manufactured
papers
by
introducing
certain
vegetable
substances
into
the
pulp
either
by
intermixture
of
such
substances
with
the
rags
already
in
use
or
by
employing
them
solely
without
the
addition
of
rags
a
partnership
for
working
the
patent
to
be
presently
applied
for
is
entered
upon
by
david
sechard
and
the
firm
of
cointet
brothers
subject
to
the
following
conditional
clauses
and
stipulations
one
of
the
clauses
so
drafted
that
david
sechard
forfeited
all
his
rights
if
he
failed
to
fulfil
his
engagements
within
the
year
the
tall
cointet
was
particularly
careful
to
insert
that
clause
and
david
sechard
allowed
it
to
pass
when
appeared
with
a
copy
of
the
agreement
next
morning
at
seven
he
brought
news
for
david
and
his
wife
cerizet
offered
thousand
francs
for
the
business
the
whole
affair
could
be
signed
and
settled
in
the
course
of
the
evening
but
if
the
cointets
knew
about
it
he
added
they
would
be
quite
capable
of
refusing
to
sign
the
deed
of
partnership
of
harassing
you
and
selling
you
up
are
you
sure
of
payment
asked
eve
she
had
thought
it
hopeless
to
try
to
sell
the
business
and
now
to
her
astonishment
a
bargain
which
would
have
been
their
salvation
three
months
ago
was
concluded
in
this
summary
fashion
the
money
has
been
deposited
with
me
he
answered
succinctly
why
here
is
magic
at
work
said
david
and
he
asked
for
an
explanation
of
this
piece
of
luck
no
said
it
is
very
simple
the
merchants
in
want
a
newspaper
but
i
am
bound
not
to
publish
a
paper
said
david
yes
you
are
bound
but
is
your
successor
however
it
is
he
continued
do
not
trouble
yourself
at
all
sell
the
business
pocket
the
proceeds
and
leave
cerizet
to
find
his
way
through
the
conditions
of
the
sale
he
can
take
care
of
himself
yes
said
eve
and
if
it
turns
out
that
you
may
not
print
a
newspaper
in
angouleme
said
those
who
are
finding
the
capital
for
cerizet
will
bring
out
the
paper
in
the
prospect
of
thousand
francs
of
want
now
at
end
dazzled
eve
the
partnership
and
its
hopes
took
a
second
place
and
therefore
and
mme
sechard
gave
way
on
a
final
point
of
dispute
the
tall
cointet
insisted
that
the
patent
should
be
taken
out
in
the
name
of
any
one
of
the
partners
what
difference
could
it
make
the
stout
cointet
said
the
last
word
he
is
finding
the
money
for
the
patent
he
is
bearing
the
expenses
of
the
journey
another
two
thousand
francs
over
and
above
the
rest
of
the
expenses
he
must
take
it
out
in
his
own
name
or
we
will
not
stir
in
the
matter
the
lynx
gained
a
victory
at
all
points
the
deed
of
partnership
was
signed
that
afternoon
at
four
the
tall
cointet
politely
gave
mme
sechard
a
dozen
forks
and
spoons
and
a
beautiful
ternaux
shawl
by
way
of
said
he
and
to
efface
any
unpleasant
impression
made
in
the
heat
of
discussion
the
copies
of
the
draft
had
scarcely
been
made
out
cachan
had
barely
had
time
to
send
the
documents
to
together
with
the
three
unlucky
forged
bills
when
the
sechards
heard
a
deafening
rumble
in
the
street
a
dray
from
the
messageries
stopped
before
the
door
and
kolb
voice
made
the

a

for
me
perhaps
i

better
to

david
will
be
released
and
with
the
four
thousand
francs
he
can
buy
a
little
no
doubt
and
make
his
fortune
forget
me
all
of
you
this
is
the
wish
of
your
unhappy
brother
lucien
it
is
decreed
that
my
poor
boy
should
be
unlucky
in
everything
and
even
when
he
does
well
as
he
said
himself
said
mme
chardon
as
she
watched
the
men
piling
up
the
bags
we
have
had
a
narrow
escape
exclaimed
the
tall
cointet
when
he
was
once
more
in
the
place
du
murier
an
hour
later
the
glitter
of
the
silver
would
have
thrown
a
new
light
on
the
deed
of
partnership
our
man
would
have
fought
shy
of
it
we
have
his
promise
now
and
in
three
months
time
we
shall
know
what
to
do
that
very
evening
at
seven
cerizet
bought
the
business
and
the
money
was
paid
over
the
purchaser
undertaking
to
pay
rent
for
the
last
quarter
the
next
day
eve
sent
forty
thousand
francs
to
the
and
bought
two
thousand
five
hundred
francs
of
in
her
husband
name
then
she
wrote
to
her
and
asked
him
to
find
a
small
farm
worth
about
ten
thousand
francs
for
her
near
marsac
she
meant
to
invest
her
own
fortune
in
this
way
the
tall
cointet
plot
was
formidably
simple
from
the
very
first
he
considered
that
the
plan
of
sizing
the
pulp
in
the
vat
was
impracticable
the
real
secret
of
fortune
lay
in
the
composition
of
the
pulp
in
the
cheap
vegetable
fibre
as
a
substitute
for
rags
he
made
up
his
mind
therefore
to
lay
immense
stress
on
the
secondary
problem
of
sizing
the
pulp
and
to
pass
over
the
discovery
of
cheap
raw
material
and
for
the
following
reasons
the
angouleme
manufacture
paper
for
stationers
notepaper
foolscap
crown
and
are
all
necessarily
sized
and
these
papers
have
been
the
pride
of
the
angouleme
mills
for
a
long
while
past
stationery
being
the
specialty
of
the
charente
this
fact
gave
color
to
the
cointet
urgency
upon
the
point
of
sizing
in
the
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
cared
nothing
for
this
part
of
david
researches
the
demand
for
is
exceedingly
small
compared
with
the
almost
unlimited
demand
for
unsized
paper
for
printers
as
boniface
cointet
traveled
to
paris
to
take
out
the
patent
in
his
own
name
he
was
projecting
plans
that
were
like
to
work
a
revolution
in
his
arrived
in
paris
he
took
up
his
quarters
with
metivier
and
gave
his
instructions
to
his
agent
metivier
was
to
call
upon
the
proprietors
of
newspapers
and
offer
to
deliver
paper
at
prices
below
those
quoted
by
all
other
houses
he
could
guarantee
in
each
case
that
the
paper
should
be
a
better
color
and
in
every
way
superior
to
the
best
kinds
hitherto
in
use
newspapers
are
always
supplied
by
contract
there
would
be
time
before
the
present
contracts
expired
to
complete
all
the
subterranean
operations
with
buyers
and
to
obtain
a
monopoly
of
the
trade
cointet
calculated
that
he
could
rid
himself
of
sechard
while
metivier
was
taking
orders
from
the
principal
paris
newspapers
which
even
then
consumed
two
hundred
reams
daily
cointet
naturally
offered
metivier
a
large
commission
on
the
contracts
for
he
wished
to
secure
a
clever
representative
on
the
spot
and
to
waste
no
time
in
traveling
to
and
fro
and
in
this
manner
the
fortunes
of
the
firm
of
metivier
one
of
the
largest
houses
in
the
paper
trade
were
founded
the
tall
cointet
went
back
to
angouleme
to
be
present
at
wedding
with
a
mind
at
rest
as
to
the
future
had
sold
his
professional
connection
and
was
only
waiting
for
milaud
promotion
to
take
the
public
prosecutor
place
which
had
been
promised
to
him
by
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
the
public
prosecutor
second
deputy
was
appointed
first
deputy
to
the
court
of
limoges
the
keeper
of
the
seals
sent
a
man
of
his
own
to
angouleme
and
the
post
of
first
deputy
was
kept
vacant
for
a
couple
of
months
the
interval
was
honeymoon
while
boniface
cointet
was
in
paris
david
made
a
first
experimental
batch
of
unsized
paper
far
superior
to
that
in
common
use
for
newspapers
he
followed
it
up
with
a
second
batch
of
magnificent
vellum
paper
for
fine
printing
and
this
the
cointets
used
for
a
new
edition
of
their
diocesan
the
material
had
been
privately
prepared
by
david
himself
he
would
have
no
helpers
but
kolb
and
marion
when
boniface
came
back
the
whole
affair
wore
a
different
aspect
he
looked
at
the
samples
and
was
fairly
satisfied
my
good
friend
he
said
the
whole
trade
of
angouleme
is
in
crown
paper
we
must
make
the
best
possible
crown
paper
at
half
the
present
price
that
is
the
first
and
foremost
question
for
us
then
david
tried
to
size
the
pulp
for
the
desired
paper
and
the
result
was
a
harsh
surface
with
grains
of
size
distributed
all
over
it
on
the
day
when
the
experiment
was
concluded
and
david
held
the
sheets
in
his
hand
he
went
away
to
find
a
spot
where
he
could
be
alone
and
swallow
his
bitter
disappointment
but
boniface
cointet
went
in
search
of
him
and
comforted
him
boniface
was
delightfully
amiable
do
not
lose
heart
he
said
go
on
i
am
a
good
fellow
i
understand
you
i
will
stand
by
you
to
the
end
really
david
said
to
his
wife
at
dinner
we
are
with
good
people
i
should
not
have
expected
that
the
tall
cointet
would
be
so
generous
and
he
repeated
his
conversation
with
his
wily
partner
three
months
were
spent
in
experiments
david
slept
at
the
mill
he
noted
the
effects
of
various
preparations
upon
the
pulp
at
one
time
he
attributed
his
to
an
admixture
of
with
his
own
ingredients
and
made
a
batch
entirely
composed
of
the
new
material
at
another
he
endeavored
to
size
pulp
made
exclusively
from
rags
persevering
in
his
experiments
under
the
eyes
of
the
tall
cointet
whom
he
had
ceased
to
mistrust
until
he
had
tried
every
possible
combination
of
pulp
and
size
david
lived
in
the
for
the
first
six
months
of
if
it
can
be
called
living
to
leave
food
untasted
and
go
in
neglect
of
person
and
dress
he
wrestled
so
desperately
with
the
difficulties
that
anybody
but
the
cointets
would
have
seen
the
sublimity
of
the
struggle
for
the
brave
fellow
was
not
thinking
of
his
own
interests
the
moment
had
come
when
he
cared
for
nothing
but
the
victory
with
marvelous
sagacity
he
watched
the
unaccountable
freaks
of
the
substances
called
into
existence
by
man
for
ends
of
his
own
substances
in
which
nature
had
been
tamed
as
it
were
and
her
tacit
resistance
overcome
and
from
these
observations
drew
great
conclusions
finding
as
he
did
that
such
creations
can
only
be
obtained
by
following
the
laws
of
the
more
remote
affinities
of
things
of
a
second
nature
as
he
called
it
in
substances
towards
the
end
of
august
he
succeeded
to
some
extent
in
sizing
the
paper
pulp
in
the
vat
the
result
being
a
kind
of
paper
identical
with
a
make
in
use
for
printers
proofs
at
the
present
day
a
kind
of
paper
that
can
not
be
depended
upon
for
the
sizing
itself
is
not
always
certain
this
was
a
great
result
considering
the
condition
of
the
paper
trade
in
and
david
hoped
to
solve
the
final
difficulties
of
the
problem
but
it
had
cost
ten
thousand
francs
singular
rumors
were
current
at
this
time
in
angouleme
and
it
was
said
that
david
sechard
was
ruining
the
firm
of
cointet
brothers
experiments
had
eaten
up
twenty
thousand
francs
and
the
result
said
gossip
was
wretchedly
bad
paper
other
manufacturers
took
fright
at
this
hugged
themselves
on
their
methods
and
being
jealous
of
the
cointets
spread
rumors
of
the
approaching
fall
of
that
ambitious
house
as
for
the
tall
cointet
he
set
up
the
new
machinery
for
making
lengths
of
paper
in
a
ribbon
and
allowed
people
to
believe
that
he
was
buying
plant
for
david
experiments
then
the
cunning
cointet
used
david
formula
for
pulp
while
urging
his
partner
to
give
his
whole
attention
to
the
sizing
process
and
thousands
of
reams
of
the
new
paper
were
despatched
to
metivier
in
paris
when
september
arrived
the
tall
cointet
took
david
aside
and
learning
that
the
latter
meditated
a
crowning
experiment
dissuaded
him
from
further
attempts
go
to
marsac
my
dear
david
see
your
wife
and
take
a
rest
after
your
labors
we
do
want
to
ruin
ourselves
said
cointet
in
the
friendliest
way
this
great
triumph
of
yours
after
all
is
only
a
we
shall
wait
now
for
awhile
before
trying
any
new
experiments
to
be
fair
see
what
has
come
of
them
we
are
not
merely
we
are
printers
besides
and
bankers
and
people
say
that
you
are
ruining
us

gesture
of
protest
on
behalf
of
his
good
faith
was
sublime
in
its
simplicity
not
that
fifty
thousand
francs
thrown
into
the
charente
would
ruin
us
said
cointet
in
reply
to
mute
protest
but
we
do
not
wish
to
be
obliged
to
pay
cash
for
everything
in
consequence
of
slanders
that
shake
our
credit
would
bring
us
to
a
standstill
we
have
reached
the
term
fixed
by
our
agreement
and
we
are
bound
on
either
side
to
think
over
our
position
he
is
right
thought
david
he
had
forgotten
the
routine
work
of
the
business
thoroughly
absorbed
as
he
had
been
in
experiments
on
a
large
scale
david
went
to
marsac
for
the
past
six
months
he
had
gone
over
on
saturday
evening
returning
again
to
on
tuesday
morning
eve
after
much
counsel
from
her
had
bought
a
house
called
the
verberie
with
three
acres
of
land
and
a
croft
planted
with
vines
which
lay
like
a
wedge
in
the
old
man
vineyard
here
with
her
mother
and
marion
she
lived
a
very
frugal
life
for
five
thousand
francs
of
the
purchase
money
still
remained
unpaid
it
was
a
charming
little
domain
the
prettiest
bit
of
property
in
marsac
the
house
with
a
garden
before
it
and
a
yard
at
the
back
was
built
of
white
tufa
ornamented
with
carvings
cut
without
great
expense
in
that
easily
wrought
stone
and
roofed
with
slate
the
pretty
furniture
from
the
house
in
angouleme
looked
prettier
still
at
marsac
for
there
was
not
the
slightest
attempt
at
comfort
or
luxury
in
the
country
in
those
days
a
row
of
pomegranates
and
rare
plants
stood
before
the
house
on
the
side
of
the
garden
set
there
by
the
last
owner
an
old
general
who
died
under
marron
hands
david
was
enjoying
his
holiday
sitting
under
an
with
his
wife
and
father
and
little
lucien
when
the
bailiff
from
mansle
appeared
cointet
brothers
gave
their
partner
formal
notice
to
appoint
an
arbitrator
to
settle
disputes
in
accordance
with
a
clause
in
the
agreement
the
cointets
demanded
that
the
six
thousand
francs
should
be
refunded
and
the
patent
surrendered
in
consideration
of
the
enormous
outlay
made
to
no
purpose
people
say
that
you
are
ruining
them
said
old
sechard
well
well
of
all
that
you
have
done
that
is
the
one
thing
that
i
am
glad
to
know
at
nine
the
next
morning
eve
and
david
stood
in
the
little
lawyer
was
the
guardian
of
the
widow
and
orphan
by
virtue
of
his
office
and
it
seemed
to
them
that
they
could
take
no
other
advice
was
delighted
to
see
his
clients
and
insisted
that
and
mme
sechard
should
do
him
the
pleasure
of
breakfasting
with
him
do
the
cointets
want
six
thousand
francs
of
you
he
asked
smiling
how
much
is
still
owing
of
the
of
the
verberie
five
thousand
francs
monsieur
said
eve
but
i
have
two
thousand
keep
your
money
broke
in
let
us
see
five
thousand
why
you
want
quite
another
ten
thousand
francs
to
settle
yourselves
comfortably
down
yonder
very
good
in
two
hours
time
the
cointets
shall
bring
you
fifteen
thousand
francs
eve
started
with
surprise
if
you
will
renounce
all
claims
to
the
profits
under
the
deed
of
partnership
and
come
to
an
amicable
settlement
said
does
that
suit
you
will
it
really
be
lawfully
ours
asked
eve
very
much
so
said
the
lawyer
smiling
the
cointets
have
worked
you
trouble
enough
i
should
like
to
make
an
end
of
their
pretensions
listen
to
me
i
am
a
magistrate
now
and
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
you
the
truth
very
good
the
cointets
are
playing
you
false
at
this
moment
but
you
are
in
their
hands
if
you
accept
battle
you
might
possibly
gain
the
lawsuit
which
they
will
bring
do
you
wish
to
be
where
you
are
now
after
ten
years
of
litigation
experts
fees
and
expenses
of
arbitration
will
be
multiplied
the
most
contradictory
opinions
will
be
given
and
you
must
take
your
chance
and
he
added
smiling
again
there
is
no
attorney
here
that
can
defend
you
so
far
as
i
see
my
successor
has
not
much
ability
there
a
bad
compromise
is
better
than
a
successful
lawsuit
any
arrangement
that
will
give
us
a
quiet
life
will
do
for
me
said
david
called
to
his
servant
paul
go
and
ask
segaud
my
successor
to
come
he
shall
go
to
see
the
cointets
while
we
breakfast
said
addressing
his
former
clients
and
in
a
few
hours
time
you
will
be
on
your
way
home
to
marsac
ruined
but
with
minds
at
rest
ten
thousand
francs
will
bring
you
in
another
five
hundred
francs
of
income
and
you
will
live
comfortably
on
your
bit
of
property
two
hours
later
as
had
prophesied
maitre
segaud
came
back
with
an
agreement
duly
drawn
up
and
signed
by
the
cointets
and
fifteen
notes
each
for
a
thousand
francs
we
are
much
indebted
to
you
said
sechard
turning
to
why
i
have
just
this
moment
ruined
you
said
looking
at
his
astonished
former
clients
i
tell
you
again
i
have
ruined
you
as
you
will
see
as
time
goes
on
but
i
know
you
you
would
rather
be
ruined
than
wait
for
a
fortune
which
perhaps
might
come
too
late
we
are
not
mercenary
monsieur
said
madame
eve
we
thank
you
for
giving
us
the
means
of
happiness
we
shall
always
feel
grateful
to
you
great
heavens
do
call
down
blessings
on
cried
it
fills
me
with
remorse
but
i
think
i
have
made
full
reparation
if
i
am
a
magistrate
it
is
entirely
owing
to
you
and
if
anybody
is
to
feel
grateful
it
is
i
as
time
went
on
kolb
changed
his
opinion
of
sechard
senior
and
as
for
the
old
man
he
took
a
liking
to
kolb
when
he
found
that
like
himself
the
alsacien
could
neither
write
nor
read
a
word
and
that
it
was
easy
to
make
him
tipsy
the
old
bear
imparted
his
ideas
on
vine
culture
and
the
sale
of
a
vintage
to
the
and
trained
him
with
a
view
to
leaving
a
man
with
a
head
on
his
shoulders
to
look
after
his
children
when
he
should
be
gone
for
he
grew
childish
at
the
last
and
great
were
his
fears
as
to
the
fate
of
his
property
he
had
chosen
courtois
the
miller
as
his
confidant
you
will
see
how
things
will
go
with
my
children
when
i
am
under
ground
lord
it
makes
me
shudder
to
think
of
it
old
sechard
died
in
the
month
of
march
leaving
about
two
hundred
thousand
francs
in
land
his
acres
added
to
the
verberie
made
a
fine
property
which
kolb
had
managed
to
admiration
for
some
two
years
david
and
his
wife
found
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
in
gold
in
the
house
the
department
of
the
charente
had
valued
old
money
at
a
million
rumor
as
usual
exaggerating
the
amount
of
a
hoard
eve
and
david
had
barely
thirty
thousand
francs
of
income
when
they
added
their
little
fortune
to
the
inheritance
they
waited
awhile
and
so
it
fell
out
that
they
invested
their
capital
in
government
securities
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
of
july
then
and
not
until
then
could
the
department
of
the
charente
and
david
sechard
form
some
idea
of
the
wealth
of
the
tall
cointet
rich
to
the
extent
of
several
millions
of
francs
the
elder
cointet
became
a
deputy
and
is
at
this
day
a
peer
of
france
it
is
said
that
he
will
be
minister
of
commerce
in
the
next
government
for
in
he
married
mlle
popinot
daughter
of
anselme
popinot
one
of
the
most
influential
statesmen
of
the
dynasty
deputy
and
mayor
of
an
arrondissement
in
paris
david
sechard
discovery
has
been
assimilated
by
the
french
manufacturing
world
as
food
is
assimilated
by
a
living
body
thanks
to
the
introduction
of
materials
other
than
rags
france
can
produce
paper
more
cheaply
than
any
other
european
country
dutch
paper
as
david
foresaw
no
longer
exists
sooner
or
later
it
will
be
necessary
no
doubt
to
establish
a
royal
paper
manufactory
like
the
gobelins
the
sevres
porcelain
works
the
savonnerie
and
the
imprimerie
royale
which
so
far
have
escaped
the
destruction
threatened
by
vandalism
david
sechard
beloved
by
his
wife
father
of
two
boys
and
a
girl
has
the
good
taste
to
make
no
allusion
to
his
past
efforts
eve
had
the
sense
to
dissuade
him
from
following
his
terrible
vocation
for
the
inventor
like
moses
on
mount
horeb
is
consumed
by
the
burning
bush
he
cultivates
literature
by
way
of
recreation
and
leads
a
comfortable
life
of
leisure
befitting
the
landowner
who
lives
on
his
own
estate
he
has
bidden
farewell
for
ever
to
glory
and
bravely
taken
his
place
in
the
class
of
dreamers
and
collectors
for
he
dabbles
in
entomology
and
is
at
present
investigating
the
transformations
of
insects
which
science
only
knows
in
the
final
stage
everybody
has
heard
of
success
as
he
is
the
rival
of
the
great
vinet
of
provins
and
it
is
his
ambition
to
be
president
of
the
of
poitiers
cerizet
has
been
in
trouble
so
frequently
for
political
offences
that
he
has
been
a
good
deal
talked
about
and
as
one
of
the
boldest
of
the
liberal
party
he
was
nicknamed
the
brave
cerizet
when
successor
compelled
him
to
sell
his
business
in
angouleme
he
found
a
fresh
career
on
the
provincial
stage
where
his
talents
as
an
actor
were
like
to
be
turned
to
brilliant
account
the
chief
stage
heroine
however
obliged
him
to
go
to
paris
to
find
a
cure
for
love
among
the
resources
of
science
and
there
he
tried
to
curry
favor
with
the
liberal
party
as
for
lucien
the
story
of
his
return
to
paris
