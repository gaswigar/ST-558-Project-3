the
counterpane
fairy
chapter
first
the
princess
of
the
golden
castle
teddy
was
all
alone
for
his
mother
had
been
up
with
him
so
much
the
night
before
that
at
about
four
in
the
afternoon
she
said
that
she
was
going
to
lie
down
for
a
little
while
the
room
where
teddy
lay
was
very
pleasant
with
two
big
windows
and
the
furniture
covered
with
gay
india
calico
his
mother
had
set
a
glass
of
milk
on
the
table
beside
his
bed
and
left
the
stair
door
ajar
so
that
he
could
call
hannah
the
cook
if
he
wanted
anything
and
then
she
had
gone
over
to
her
own
room
the
little
boy
had
always
enjoyed
being
ill
for
then
he
was
read
aloud
to
and
had
lemonade
but
this
had
been
a
real
illness
and
though
he
was
better
now
the
doctor
still
would
not
let
him
have
anything
but
milk
and
gruel
he
was
feeling
rather
lonely
too
though
the
fire
crackled
cheerfully
and
he
could
hear
hannah
singing
to
herself
in
the
kitchen
below
teddy
turned
over
the
leaves
of
robinson
crusoe
for
a
while
looking
at
the
gaily
colored
pictures
and
then
he
closed
it
and
called
hannah
the
singing
in
the
kitchen
below
ceased
and
teddy
knew
that
hannah
was
listening
hannah
he
called
again
at
the
second
call
hannah
came
hurrying
up
the
stairs
and
into
the
room
what
do
you
want
teddy
she
asked
hannah
i
want
to
ask
mamma
something
said
teddy
oh
said
hannah
you
would
want
me
to
call
your
poor
mother
would
you
when
she
was
up
with
you
the
whole
of
last
night
and
has
just
gone
to
lie
down
a
bit
i
want
to
ask
her
something
repeated
teddy
you
ask
me
what
you
want
to
know
suggested
hannah
your
poor
mother
so
tired
that
i
sure
you
are
too
much
of
a
man
to
want
me
to
call
her
well
i
want
to
ask
her
if
i
may
have
a
cracker
said
teddy
oh
no
you
could
have
that
said
hannah
do
you
know
that
the
doctor
said
you
must
have
anything
but
milk
and
gruel
did
you
want
to
ask
her
anything
else
no
said
teddy
and
his
lip
trembled
after
that
hannah
went
to
her
work
again
and
teddy
lay
staring
out
of
the
window
at
the
windy
gray
clouds
that
were
sweeping
across
the
april
sky
he
grew
lonelier
and
lonelier
and
a
lump
rose
in
his
throat
presently
a
big
tear
trickled
down
his
cheek
and
dripped
off
his
chin
oh
dear
oh
dear
said
a
little
voice
just
back
of
the
hill
his
knees
made
as
he
lay
with
them
drawn
up
in
bed
what
a
hill
to
climb
teddy
stopped
crying
and
gazed
wonderingly
toward
where
the
voice
came
from
and
presently
over
the
top
of
his
knees
appeared
a
brown
peaked
hood
a
tiny
withered
face
a
flapping
brown
cloak
and
last
of
all
two
small
feet
in
buckled
shoes
it
was
a
little
old
woman
so
weazened
and
brown
that
she
looked
more
like
a
dried
leaf
than
anything
else
she
seated
herself
on
teddy
knees
and
gazed
down
at
him
solemnly
and
she
was
so
light
that
he
felt
her
weight
no
more
than
if
she
had
been
a
feather
teddy
lay
staring
at
her
for
a
while
and
then
he
asked
who
are
you
i
the
counterpane
fairy
said
the
little
figure
in
a
thin
little
voice
i
do
know
what
that
is
said
teddy
well
said
the
counterpane
fairy
it
the
sort
of
a
fairy
that
lives
in
houses
and
watches
out
for
the
children
i
used
to
be
one
of
the
court
fairies
but
i
grew
tired
of
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
you
know
nothing
in
what
asked
teddy
nothing
in
the
court
life
all
day
the
fairies
were
swinging
in
and
sipping
or
playing
games
of
the
only
comfort
i
had
was
with
an
old
who
lived
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
i
used
to
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
with
her
i
used
to
take
care
of
her
babies
when
she
was
out
hunting
for
something
to
eat
cunning
little
things
they
were
five
of
them
all
fat
and
soft
and
with
such
funny
little
tails
what
became
of
them
oh
they
moved
away
they
left
before
i
did
as
soon
as
they
were
old
enough
mother
went
she
said
she
could
stand
the
court
fairies
they
were
always
playing
tricks
on
her
stopping
up
the
door
of
her
house
with
sticks
and
acorns
and
making
faces
at
her
babies
until
they
almost
drove
them
into
fits
so
after
that
i
left
too
where
did
you
go
oh
hither
and
yon
mostly
where
there
were
little
sick
boys
and
girls
do
you
like
little
boys
yes
when
they
do
cry
said
the
counterpane
fairy
staring
at
him
very
hard
well
i
was
lonely
said
teddy
i
wanted
my
mamma
yes
i
know
but
you
ought
to
have
cried
i
came
to
you
though
because
you
were
lonely
and
sick
and
i
thought
maybe
you
would
like
me
to
show
you
a
story
do
you
mean
tell
me
a
story
asked
teddy
no
said
the
fairy
i
mean
show
you
a
story
it
a
game
i
invented
after
i
joined
the
counterpane
fairies
choose
any
one
of
the
squares
of
the
counterpane
and
i
will
show
you
how
to
play
it
that
all
you
have
to
do
to
choose
a
square
teddy
looked
the
counterpane
over
carefully
i
think
i
choose
that
yellow
square
he
said
because
it
looks
so
nice
and
bright
very
well
said
the
counterpane
fairy
look
straight
at
it
and
turn
your
eyes
away
until
i
count
seven
times
seven
and
then
you
shall
see
the
story
of
it
teddy
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
square
and
the
fairy
began
to
count
one
two
three
four
she
counted
teddy
heard
her
voice
thin
and
clear
as
the
hissing
of
the
logs
on
the
hearth
do
look
away
from
the
square
she
cried
five
six
seven
it
seemed
to
teddy
that
the
yellow
silk
square
was
turning
to
a
mist
before
his
eyes
and
wrapping
everything
about
him
in
a
golden
glow
thirteen
fourteen
the
fairy
counted
on
and
on
at
the
words
the
counterpane
fairy
clapped
her
hands
and
teddy
looked
about
him
he
was
no
longer
in
a
golden
mist
he
was
standing
in
a
wonderful
enchanted
garden
the
sky
was
like
the
golden
sky
at
sunset
and
the
grass
was
so
thickly
set
with
tiny
yellow
flowers
that
it
looked
like
a
golden
carpet
from
this
garden
stretched
a
long
flight
of
glass
steps
they
reached
up
and
up
and
up
to
a
great
golden
castle
with
shining
domes
and
turrets
listen
said
the
counterpane
fairy
in
that
golden
castle
there
lies
an
enchanted
princess
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
she
has
been
lying
there
waiting
for
the
hero
who
is
to
come
and
rescue
her
and
you
are
the
hero
who
can
do
it
if
you
will
with
that
the
fairy
led
him
to
a
little
pool
close
by
and
bade
him
look
in
the
water
when
teddy
looked
he
saw
himself
standing
there
in
the
golden
garden
and
he
did
not
appear
as
he
ever
had
before
he
was
tall
and
strong
and
beautiful
like
a
hero
yes
said
teddy
i
will
do
it
at
these
words
from
the
grass
the
bushes
and
the
tress
around
suddenly
started
a
flock
of
golden
birds
they
circled
about
him
and
over
him
clapping
their
wings
and
singing
triumphantly
their
song
reminded
teddy
of
the
blackbirds
that
sang
on
the
lawn
at
home
in
the
early
spring
when
the
daffodils
were
up
then
in
a
moment
they
were
all
gone
and
the
garden
was
still
again
their
song
had
filled
his
heart
with
a
longing
for
great
deeds
and
without
pausing
longer
he
ran
to
the
glass
steps
and
began
to
mount
them
up
and
up
and
up
he
went
once
he
turned
and
waved
his
hand
to
the
counterpane
fairy
in
the
golden
garden
far
below
she
waved
her
hand
in
answer
and
he
heard
her
voice
faint
and
clear
be
brave
and
strong
and
beware
of
that
that
is
little
and
gray
then
teddy
turned
his
face
toward
the
castle
and
in
a
moment
he
was
standing
before
the
great
shining
gates
he
raised
his
hand
and
struck
bravely
upon
the
door
there
was
no
answer
again
he
struck
upon
it
and
his
blow
rang
through
the
hall
inside
then
he
opened
the
door
and
went
in
the
hall
was
and
all
of
pure
gold
as
clear
and
shining
as
glass
upon
three
sides
of
it
were
three
arched
doors
one
was
of
emerald
one
was
of
ruby
and
one
was
of
diamond
they
were
arched
and
tall
and
wide
fit
for
a
hero
to
go
through
the
question
was
behind
which
one
lay
the
enchanted
princess
while
teddy
stood
there
looking
at
them
and
wondering
he
heard
a
little
thin
voice
that
seemed
to
be
singing
to
itself
and
this
is
what
it
sang
in
and
out
and
out
and
in
quick
as
a
flash
i
weave
and
spin
some
may
mistake
and
some
forget
but
i
have
my
finished
yet
when
teddy
heard
the
song
he
knew
that
someone
must
be
awake
in
the
enchanted
castle
so
he
began
looking
about
him
on
the
fourth
side
of
the
wall
there
hung
a
curtain
of
and
the
voice
seemed
to
come
from
it
the
hero
went
toward
it
but
he
saw
nothing
for
the
spider
that
was
spinning
it
moved
so
fast
that
no
eyes
could
follow
it
presently
it
paused
up
in
the
corner
of
the
web
and
then
teddy
saw
it
it
looked
very
little
to
have
spun
all
that
curtain
of
silvery
web
as
teddy
stood
looking
at
it
it
began
to
sing
again
here
in
my
shining
web
i
sit
to
look
about
and
rest
a
bit
i
rest
myself
a
bit
and
then
quick
as
a
flash
i
begin
again
mistress
spinner
mistress
spinner
cried
teddy
can
you
tell
me
where
to
find
the
enchanted
princess
who
lies
asleep
waiting
for
me
to
come
and
rescue
her
the
spider
sat
quite
still
for
a
while
and
then
it
said
in
a
voice
as
thin
as
a
hair
you
must
go
through
the
emerald
door
you
must
go
through
the
emerald
door
what
so
fit
as
the
emerald
door
for
the
hero
who
would
do
great
deeds
teddy
did
not
so
much
as
stay
to
thank
the
little
gray
spinner
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
find
the
princess
but
turning
he
sprang
to
the
emerald
door
flung
it
open
and
stepped
outside
he
found
himself
standing
on
the
glass
steps
and
as
his
foot
touched
the
topmost
one
the
whole
flight
closed
up
like
an
umbrella
and
in
a
moment
teddy
was
sliding
down
the
smooth
glass
pane
faster
and
faster
and
faster
until
he
could
hardly
catch
his
breath
the
next
thing
he
knew
he
was
standing
in
the
golden
garden
and
there
was
the
counterpane
fairy
beside
him
looking
at
him
sadly
you
should
have
known
better
than
to
try
the
emerald
door
she
said
and
now
shall
we
break
the
story
oh
no
no
cried
teddy
and
he
was
still
the
hero
let
me
try
once
more
for
it
may
be
i
can
yet
save
the
princess
then
the
counterpane
fairy
smiled
very
well
she
said
you
shall
try
again
but
remember
what
i
told
you
beware
of
that
that
is
little
and
gray
and
take
this
with
you
for
it
may
be
of
use
stooping
she
picked
up
a
blade
of
grass
from
the
ground
and
handed
it
to
him
the
hero
took
it
wondering
and
in
his
hands
it
was
changed
to
a
sword
that
shone
so
brightly
that
it
dazzled
his
eyes
then
he
turned
and
there
was
the
long
flight
of
glass
steps
leading
up
to
the
golden
castle
just
as
before
so
thrusting
the
magic
sword
into
his
belt
he
ran
nimbly
up
and
up
and
up
and
not
until
he
reached
the
very
topmost
step
did
he
turn
and
look
back
to
wave
farewell
to
the
counterpane
fairy
below
she
waved
her
hand
to
him
remember
she
called
beware
of
what
is
little
and
gray
he
opened
the
door
and
went
into
the
golden
hall
and
there
were
the
three
doors
just
as
before
and
the
spider
spinning
and
singing
on
the
fourth
side
now
the
brave
hero
is
wiser
indeed
he
may
have
failed
once
but
he
still
may
succeed
dull
are
the
emeralds
diamonds
are
bright
so
is
his
wisdom
that
shines
as
the
light
the
diamond
door
cried
teddy
yes
that
is
the
door
that
i
should
have
tried
how
could
i
have
thought
the
emerald
door
was
it
and
opening
the
diamond
door
he
stepped
through
it
he
hardly
had
time
to
see
that
he
was
standing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
steps
before
they
had
shut
up
again
into
a
smooth
glass
hill
and
there
he
was
spinning
down
them
so
fast
that
the
wind
whistled
past
his
ears
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
he
was
back
again
for
the
third
time
in
the
golden
garden
with
the
counterpane
fairy
standing
before
him
and
he
was
ashamed
to
raise
his
eyes
so
said
the
counterpane
fairy
did
you
know
no
better
than
to
open
the
diamond
door
no
said
teddy
i
knew
no
better
then
said
the
fairy
if
you
can
pay
no
better
heed
to
my
warnings
than
that
the
princess
must
wait
for
another
hero
for
you
are
not
the
one
let
me
try
but
once
more
cried
teddy
for
this
time
i
shall
surely
find
her
then
you
may
try
once
more
and
for
the
last
time
said
the
fairy
but
beware
of
what
is
little
and
gray
stooping
she
picked
from
the
grass
beside
her
a
fallen
acorn
cup
and
handed
it
to
him
take
this
with
you
she
said
for
it
may
serve
you
well
as
he
took
it
from
her
it
was
changed
in
his
hand
to
a
goblet
of
gold
set
round
with
precious
stones
he
thrust
it
into
his
bosom
for
he
was
in
haste
and
turning
he
ran
for
the
third
time
up
the
flight
of
glass
steps
this
time
so
eager
was
he
that
he
never
once
paused
to
look
back
but
all
the
time
he
ran
on
up
and
up
he
was
wondering
what
it
was
that
she
meant
about
her
warning
she
had
said
beware
of
what
is
little
and
gray
what
had
he
seen
that
was
little
and
gray
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
great
golden
hall
he
walked
over
to
the
curtain
of
the
spider
was
spinning
so
fast
that
it
was
little
more
than
a
gray
streak
but
presently
it
stopped
up
in
the
corner
of
the
web
as
the
hero
looked
at
it
he
saw
that
it
was
little
and
gray
then
it
began
to
sing
to
him
in
its
little
thin
voice
great
hero
wiser
than
ever
before
try
the
red
door
try
the
red
door
open
the
door
that
is
ruby
and
then
you
never
need
search
for
the
princess
again
no
i
will
not
open
the
ruby
door
cried
teddy
twice
have
you
sent
me
back
to
the
golden
garden
and
now
you
shall
fool
me
no
more
as
he
said
this
he
saw
that
one
corner
of
the
curtain
was
still
unfinished
in
spite
of
the
spider
haste
and
underneath
was
something
that
looked
like
a
little
yellow
door
then
suddenly
he
knew
that
that
was
the
door
he
must
go
through
he
caught
hold
of
the
curtain
and
pulled
but
it
was
as
strong
as
steel
quick
as
a
flash
he
snatched
from
his
belt
the
magic
sword
and
with
one
blow
the
curtain
was
cut
in
two
and
fell
at
his
feet
he
heard
the
little
gray
spider
calling
to
him
in
its
thin
voice
but
he
paid
no
heed
for
he
had
opened
the
little
yellow
door
and
stooped
his
head
and
entered
beyond
was
a
great
courtyard
all
of
gold
and
with
a
fountain
leaping
and
splashing
back
into
a
golden
basin
in
the
middle
bet
what
he
saw
first
of
all
was
the
enchanted
princess
who
lay
stretched
out
as
if
asleep
upon
a
couch
all
covered
with
cloth
of
gold
he
knew
she
was
a
princess
because
she
was
so
beautiful
and
because
she
wore
a
golden
crown
he
stood
looking
at
her
without
stirring
and
at
last
he
whispered
princess
princess
i
have
come
to
save
you
still
she
did
not
stir
he
bent
and
touched
her
but
she
lay
there
in
her
enchanted
sleep
and
her
eyes
did
not
open
then
teddy
looked
about
him
and
seeing
the
fountain
he
drew
the
magic
cup
from
his
bosom
and
filling
it
sprinkled
the
hands
and
face
of
the
princess
with
the
water
then
her
eyes
opened
and
she
raised
herself
upon
her
elbow
and
smiled
have
you
come
at
last
she
cried
yes
answered
teddy
i
have
come
the
princess
looked
about
her
but
what
became
of
the
spider
she
said
then
teddy
too
looked
about
and
there
was
the
spider
running
across
the
floor
toward
where
the
princess
lay
quickly
he
sprang
from
her
side
and
set
his
foot
upon
it
there
was
a
thin
squeak
and
then
there
was
nothing
left
of
the
little
gray
spinner
but
a
tiny
gray
smudge
on
the
floor
instantly
the
golden
castle
was
shaken
from
top
to
bottom
and
there
was
a
sound
of
many
voices
shouting
outside
the
princess
rose
to
her
feet
and
caught
the
hero
by
the
hand
you
have
broken
the
enchantment
she
cried
and
now
you
shall
be
the
king
of
the
golden
castle
and
reign
with
me
oh
but
i
ca
said
teddy
because
because
but
the
princess
drew
him
out
with
her
through
the
hall
and
there
they
were
at
the
head
of
the
flight
of
glass
steps
a
great
host
of
soldiers
and
courtiers
were
running
up
it
they
were
dressed
in
cloth
of
gold
and
they
shouted
at
the
sight
of
teddy
hail
to
the
hero
hail
to
the
hero
and
teddy
knew
them
by
their
voices
for
the
golden
birds
that
had
fluttered
around
him
in
the
garden
below
and
all
this
is
yours
said
the
beautiful
princess
turning
toward
him
with
so
that
is
the
story
of
the
yellow
square
said
the
counterpane
fairy
teddy
looked
about
him
the
golden
castle
was
gone
and
the
stairs
and
the
shouting
courtiers
he
was
lying
in
bed
with
the
silk
coverlet
over
his
little
knees
and
hannah
was
still
singing
in
the
kitchen
below
did
you
like
it
asked
the
fairy
teddy
heaved
a
deep
sigh
oh
was
it
beautiful
he
said
then
he
lay
for
a
while
thinking
and
smiling
was
the
princess
lovely
he
whispered
half
to
himself
the
counterpane
fairy
got
up
slowly
and
stiffly
and
picked
up
the
staff
that
she
had
laid
down
beside
her
well
i
must
be
journeying
on
she
said
oh
no
no
cried
teddy
please
do
go
yet
yes
i
must
said
the
counterpane
fairy
i
hear
your
mother
coming
but
will
you
come
back
again
cried
teddy
the
counterpane
fairy
made
no
answer
she
was
walking
down
the
other
side
of
the
bedquilt
hill
and
teddy
heard
her
voice
little
and
thin
dying
away
in
the
distance
oh
dear
dear
dear
what
a
hill
to
go
down
what
a
hill
it
is
oh
dear
dear
dear
then
the
door
opened
and
his
mother
came
in
she
was
looking
rested
and
she
smiled
at
him
lovingly
but
the
little
brown
counterpane
fairy
was
gone
chapter
second
the
owls
and
the
gamblesome
elf
the
next
morning
when
teddy
awoke
it
was
still
very
early
so
early
that
even
hannah
was
not
yet
stirring
outside
everything
was
wrapped
in
a
silvery
mist
and
now
and
then
a
drop
of
moisture
plumped
down
on
the
porch
roof
teddy
lay
still
for
a
while
growing
wider
and
wider
awake
and
then
he
began
to
stir
restlessly
and
wish
that
his
mother
would
come
after
a
while
he
called
her
but
the
house
was
so
silent
that
he
did
like
to
call
very
loudly
and
there
was
no
answer
he
thought
he
would
call
again
and
then
suddenly
he
remembered
the
counterpane
fairy
and
wondered
if
she
would
like
little
boys
who
called
their
mothers
so
early
he
turned
over
in
bed
and
raising
his
knees
into
a
hill
stared
at
the
yellow
silk
square
and
thought
of
the
wonderful
golden
castle
where
she
had
taken
him
the
day
before
he
wished
he
knew
what
all
the
bird
people
would
have
done
when
they
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
he
thought
they
would
have
put
a
golden
crown
on
his
head
and
made
him
king
and
the
princess
was
so
beautiful
he
longed
to
see
her
again
how
surprised
hannah
would
have
been
if
she
had
heard
voices
and
had
come
to
see
who
it
was
and
had
found
the
beautiful
princess
sitting
with
him
and
had
seen
the
golden
crown
on
his
head
if
she
only
knew
about
it
she
would
never
call
him
a
mischievous
boy
again
he
had
done
a
great
deal
more
than
hannah
could
oh
dear
oh
dear
said
a
little
voice
just
back
of
his
knees
almost
at
the
top
anyway
teddy
knew
the
voice
it
was
that
of
the
counterpane
fairy
and
there
was
the
top
of
her
brown
hood
showing
over
his
knees
he
watched
breathless
with
eagerness
until
he
saw
her
face
appear
above
them
and
then
he
cried
out
i
wondered
whether
you
would
come
i
so
glad
are
you
going
to
show
me
another
story
and
will
you
stay
a
long
while
the
counterpane
fairy
said
nothing
until
she
had
sat
down
on
top
of
his
knees
for
a
while
and
caught
her
breath
and
then
she
said
well
well
it
steeper
than
it
was
yesterday
i
thought
i
should
never
get
across
that
satin
square
it
was
so
slippery
shall
i
put
my
knees
down
asked
teddy
moving
them
for
mercy
sake
no
said
the
fairy
clutching
at
the
quilt
you
might
upset
me
keep
right
still
and
i
show
you
another
story
oh
yes
cried
teddy
please
do
and
let
me
go
to
the
golden
castle
again
no
i
ca
do
that
said
the
counterpane
fairy
for
that
was
yesterday
story
and
this
will
be
another
but
what
became
of
the
princess
asked
teddy
oh
she
married
the
hero
of
course
said
the
fairy
but
i
thought
i
was
the
hero
there
there
said
the
fairy
impatiently
i
told
you
that
was
yesterday
story
and
if
you
want
to
see
any
more
you
must
choose
another
square
well
i
will
said
teddy
may
i
choose
that
green
square
yes
said
the
fairy
now
fix
your
eyes
on
it
while
i
count
teddy
began
to
stare
at
the
green
square
so
hard
that
he
scarcely
winked
but
he
heard
the
counterpane
fairy
counting
on
in
her
thin
little
voice
until
she
reached
the
green
square
spread
and
grew
just
as
the
yellow
one
had
done
while
she
counted
until
teddy
seemed
drifting
off
into
endless
green
spaces
then
the
counterpane
fairy
clapped
her
hands
and
he
saw
that
he
was
hovering
over
a
grassy
hillside
now
you
are
an
elf
you
know
he
heard
the
fairy
say
at
the
bottom
of
the
green
hill
there
was
a
brook
and
at
the
top
was
a
line
of
shady
green
woods
overhead
the
sky
was
very
blue
with
shining
heaps
of
cottony
white
clouds
a
soft
wind
was
blowing
but
the
sun
was
warm
and
insects
were
buzzing
past
intent
on
business
a
brown
bird
whirred
by
and
dropped
out
of
sight
among
the
grasses
teddy
floated
through
the
air
lighter
than
a
feather
and
he
felt
so
happy
that
he
clapped
his
hands
together
and
turned
head
over
heels
in
the
air
as
he
came
right
side
up
again
he
saw
a
bit
of
drifting
on
up
the
hill
and
he
was
so
little
that
when
he
flew
after
it
and
set
himself
astride
of
it
it
seemed
as
big
as
a
barrel
to
him
he
floated
on
up
the
hill
with
it
and
the
wind
was
like
a
cushion
behind
him
as
they
reached
the
edge
of
the
hill
the
caught
on
a
bush
and
teddy
almost
has
his
leg
wedged
between
it
and
a
leaf
he
jumped
off
in
a
hurry
and
stood
looking
about
him
and
wondering
what
he
should
do
next
suddenly
he
saw
something
that
made
him
open
his
eyes
wide
in
astonishment
four
large
butterflies
were
tied
to
a
knot
on
an
old
tree
close
by
but
it
was
not
at
the
butterflies
themselves
that
he
wondered
for
he
had
often
seen
them
flitting
about
the
fields
it
was
at
the
way
they
were
loaded
down
with
the
strangest
things
all
sorts
of
fairy
household
furniture
little
chairs
and
tables
bedsteads
tiny
pots
and
pans
a
great
almost
as
large
as
a
huckleberry
two
mattresses
and
a
number
of
other
things
all
these
were
very
neatly
packed
and
tied
between
the
butterflies
wings
with
ropes
in
the
middle
of
the
knot
was
a
hole
but
instead
of
being
round
as
a
generally
is
it
was
square
and
there
was
a
little
door
fitted
into
it
suddenly
this
door
opened
and
on
the
threshold
of
it
stood
a
beautiful
little
fairy
she
stood
there
looking
about
and
then
she
drew
from
her
pocket
a
handkerchief
thin
and
delicate
as
gossamer
and
wiped
her
eyes
after
that
she
began
to
sob
and
teddy
knew
that
what
he
had
thought
was
the
buzzing
of
a
bee
inside
the
knot
had
really
been
the
sound
of
her
weeping
hello
called
the
elf
the
fairy
stopped
sobbing
and
looked
about
her
when
she
saw
teddy
she
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
she
began
to
wipe
her
eyes
and
sob
again
teddy
climbed
up
the
branch
of
a
blackberry
bush
until
he
was
quite
close
to
the
and
sat
down
on
the
stem
and
stared
at
her
what
makes
you
cry
he
asked
still
the
fairy
said
nothing
but
she
folded
her
little
handkerchief
though
it
was
quite
wet
and
put
it
carefully
back
into
her
pocket
just
then
in
the
doorway
at
her
side
appeared
another
fairy
he
was
quite
different
from
her
though
he
too
was
very
small
he
was
as
withered
as
a
dried
pea
and
looked
as
though
he
must
be
at
least
a
hundred
years
old
is
everything
packed
up
he
asked
in
a
querulous
voice
then
his
eyes
fell
on
teddy
the
elf
he
scowled
until
his
little
of
eyes
almost
disappeared
ugh
there
one
of
those
nasty
gamblesome
elves
he
said
now
mischief
sure
to
follow
i
not
a
gamblesome
elf
cried
teddy
yes
you
are
said
the
withered
old
fairy
you
need
tell
me
look
at
your
red
cap
and
the
way
your
toes
turn
down
i
say
you
are
a
gamblesome
elf
teddy
looked
at
his
toes
and
sure
enough
they
did
turn
down
i
wonder
if
i
am
a
gamblesome
elf
he
thought
but
the
old
fairy
paid
no
more
attention
to
him
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
great
hurry
and
very
cross
he
bustled
in
and
out
of
the
bringing
a
broom
and
an
old
coat
that
had
been
forgotten
and
packed
them
on
the
butterflies
and
then
he
helped
the
lady
fairy
on
to
one
and
clambered
on
another
himself
after
they
were
all
ready
to
start
he
found
that
he
had
forgotten
to
unhitch
the
butterflies
and
grumbling
and
scolding
he
clambered
down
again
and
untied
them
then
he
climbed
back
once
more
and
away
they
flew
down
the
hillside
and
out
of
sight
the
lady
fairy
weeping
all
the
time
as
though
her
heart
would
break
i
wonder
what
she
was
crying
about
said
the
gamblesome
elf
to
himself
as
he
stared
after
them
i
can
tell
you
that
easily
enough
said
a
little
voice
so
close
to
his
elbow
that
it
made
him
jump
he
looked
around
and
saw
close
to
him
a
brown
beetle
sitting
on
a
blackberry
leaf
teddy
looked
at
the
beetle
for
a
while
in
silence
and
then
he
said
well
why
is
it
they
going
it
all
because
of
old
owl
said
the
beetle
she
and
old
father
owl
used
to
live
deep
in
the
woods
in
a
hollow
tree
but
one
time
they
determined
to
move
out
to
the
edge
of
the
hill
because
the
air
was
better
and
what
tree
should
they
choose
for
their
home
but
this
very
one
where
granddaddy
thistletop
has
been
living
as
long
as
i
can
remember
then
when
the
owls
were
all
settled
they
began
to
complain
they
said
that
granddaddy
thistletop
and
rosine
were
so
noisy
all
day
that
they
could
sleep
after
the
little
owls
hatched
out
it
was
worse
than
ever
for
the
old
mother
said
that
every
time
rosine
cooked
the
dinner
it
made
the
little
owls
sneeze
and
so
the
fairies
must
go
i
would
have
gone
cried
teddy
oh
yes
you
would
said
the
beetle
the
owls
could
have
stopped
up
the
doors
and
windows
or
they
could
well
they
could
have
done
almost
anything
they
so
big
you
may
go
in
and
look
at
the
house
if
you
want
to
i
have
to
go
down
the
bush
and
see
old
ant
see
you
again
after
a
while
when
the
beetle
had
gone
teddy
climbed
up
to
the
and
went
in
there
was
a
long
entry
as
narrow
and
dark
as
a
and
with
doors
opening
off
from
it
here
and
there
at
the
end
of
the
hall
was
a
room
that
must
have
been
the
kitchen
it
was
very
bare
and
lonely
now
and
there
was
a
fireplace
at
one
end
with
a
streak
of
light
shining
down
through
the
chimney
while
teddy
was
standing
by
the
chimney
he
heard
a
rustling
and
stirring
about
overhead
one
of
the
little
owls
clicked
its
beak
in
its
sleep
and
he
heard
a
sleepy
whining
voice
now
just
you
stop
scrouging
me
screecher
is
scrouging
me
then
he
heard
the
mother
owl
go
to
sleep
broad
daylight
yet
after
that
all
was
still
again
i
wish
thought
teddy
to
himself
that
i
could
do
something
to
make
the
owls
go
away
then
he
began
to
giggle
to
himself
and
put
both
hands
over
his
mouth
so
that
the
owls
up
above
would
hear
him
he
tiptoed
back
to
the
door
in
the
and
looked
down
at
a
bush
with
long
thorns
on
it
that
grew
close
by
i
do
it
he
said
to
himself
i
break
off
the
thorns
and
put
them
in
the
nest
so
that
the
owls
just
ca
stay
there
in
a
moment
he
was
down
on
the
bush
and
tugging
at
a
tough
thorn
as
soon
as
it
broke
off
he
lifted
it
on
his
shoulder
and
clambered
up
the
rough
bark
of
the
tree
to
the
great
black
hole
where
the
owls
lived
when
he
looked
down
into
it
there
they
were
in
the
nest
fluffy
and
gray
and
fast
asleep
very
quietly
he
slipped
down
and
set
the
thorn
in
the
side
of
the
nest
with
the
point
sticking
out
after
that
he
softly
clambered
out
again
up
and
down
up
and
down
the
tree
he
climbed
again
and
again
carrying
thorns
and
quietly
setting
them
in
the
nest
and
as
he
went
up
and
down
he
kept
whispering
to
himself
i
a

and
putting
one
big
yellow
eye
at
the
kitchen
window
she
looked
in
you

she
cried

in
there
still
at
first
her
eye
looked
so
very
big
and
yellow
that
teddy
was
frightened
then
he
remembered
that
he
was
a
gamblesome
elf
so
he
made
a
face
at
her
and
began
to
hop
up
and
down
and
twirl
about
on
his
toes
singing
i

owl

the
old
owl
looked
in
for
a
moment
and
then
without
a
word
she
flew
back
to
her
nest
as
fast
as
she
could
teddy
ran
over
to
the
chimney
and
listened
he
heard
the
old
owl
brush
into
the
hollow
above
and
then
he
heard
her
saying
in
a
frightened
voice
husband
husband

gamblesome
elf

bad

time

would
have
been
better
if

old
thistletop

cried
old
mother
owl
in
an
exasperated
voice
what

but
to
get
the
children

offer
me
but
how

old
father
owl

cried
all
the
little
owls
oh

we
do
ow

they
got

said
mother
owl
and
you
and
i
must
help
them
back
to
the
old
tree
we
go
this
very
night
after
that
there
was
a
great
up
in
the
hollow
teddy
watched
it
all
lying
on
his
stomach
in
the
door
of
the
for
it
was
moonlight
by
this
time
and
almost
as
bright
as
day
the
little
owls
got
up
on
the
edge
of
the
hollow
and
there
they
sat
teetering
and
flapping
and
afraid
to
fly
their
mother
grew
crosser
and
crosser
and
at
last
she
got
back
of
them
and
gave
them
a
push
and
then
down
they
went
fluttering
and
tumbling
and
bumping
into
the
the
father
owl
sailed
about
from
branch
to
branch
calling
come
on
spread
your
wings
and
go
like
this
and
then
he
would
sail
on
to
another
bush
but
the
mother
owl
flew
down
beside
them
and
showed
them
how
to
spread
their
wings
and
pushed
them
with
her
beak
and
gradually
the
fluttered
farther
and
farther
into
the
darkling
woods
their
cries
growing
fainter
and
then
dying
away
until
all
teddy
could
hear
was
the
father
owl
voice
very
faint
and
far
away
then
it
too
died
away
and
the
woods
were
still
after
a
while
the
moon
set
and
teddy
began
to
feel
very
sleepy
then
a
little
breeze
sprang
up
the
light
grew
clearer
and
the
east
was
red
and
at
last
the
sun
peeped
over
the
top
of
the
hill
opposite
as
the
first
beam
struck
old
granddaddy
thistletop
tree
teddy
started
to
his
knees
gazing
out
down
the
there
were
the
four
butterflies
flying
directly
toward
the
tree
as
fast
as
their
wings
could
carry
them
and
on
the
two
foremost
ones
were
old
granddaddy
thistletop
himself
and
the
beautiful
rosine
they
drew
rein
at
the
and
the
old
fairy
skipping
from
his
butterfly
and
never
pausing
to
fasten
it
tottered
straight
to
teddy
and
threw
his
arms
about
his
neck
our
preserver
he
cried
and
to
think
i
should
have
called
you
a
gamblesome
elf
but
never
mind
i
will
make
it
up
to
you
suddenly
he
turned
and
caught
the
blushing
rosine
by
the
hand
here
he
cried
she
is
yours
and
you
shall
live
with
us
and
learn
to
turn
your
toes
up
and
we
will
all
be
happy
together
but
but
cried
teddy
starting
back
do
you
know
i
not
an
elf
at
all
i
well
well
here
we
are
back
again
said
the
counterpane
fairy
and
stiff
enough
i
feel
after
all
that
journeying
oh
was
it
funny
said
teddy
and
his
knees
shook
with
laughter
they
really
thought
i
was
a
gamblesome
elf
take
care
cried
the
fairy
there
you
are
shaking
your
knees
again
i
think
my
dear
that
if
you
were
to
lower
them
very
very
carefully
the
hill
would
not
be
quite
so
steep
yes
i
be
careful
said
teddy
beginning
very
slowly
to
slide
his
feet
down
in
the
bed
suddenly
the
turned
and
teddy
gave
a
start
quick
as
a
flash
the
counterpane
fairy
had
disappeared
his
mother
was
coming
in
carrying
his
breakfast
and
a
little
vase
of
violets
on
a
tray
why
my
darling
what
a
bright
happy
face
she
said

hannah
putting
her
head
in
at

close
to

bed
playing
a
game
of
old

said
mamma
and
then
she
went
out
teddy
lay
propped
up
on
the
pillow
and
shuffled
and
shuffled
the
cards
and
wished
his
mother
would
hurry
he
did
not
like
ann
mcfinney
for
when
she
came
she
always
cried
and
wiped
her
eyes
on
the
corner
of
her
apron
and
told
how
her
husband
was
out
of
work
and
the
children
needed
shoes
now
it
was
some
time
before
mamma
came
back
and
when
she
did
she
had
her
bonnet
on
darling
she
said
i
have
to
go
out

a
while

and
i
promised

poor

and
when

back
i
bring

a
paper
circus
said
teddy
very
well
said
mamma
i
bring
you
a
circus
instead
then
she
gave
him
some
to
look
at
while
she
was
out
and
kissed
him
telling
him
to
be
a
good
boy
she
went
out
through
the
next
room
and
he
heard
her
pause
to
wind
the
and
set
it
playing
there
she
called
back
to
him
have
the
music
to
keep
you
company
and
then
she
went
on
after
she
had
gone
teddy
lay
fingering
the
books
and
not
caring
to
open
them
he
knew
them
so
well
oh
dear
he
sighed
i
wish
the
counterpane
fairy
was
here
oh
dear
dear
dear
how
steep
this
hill
is
said
a
little
voice
just
back
of
his
knees
do
break
me
little
staff
or
down
i
go
head
over
heels
to
the
bottom
teddy
knew
the
voice
well
and
his
heart
gave
a
leap
of
pleasure
there
was
the
pointed
cap
and
the
withered
face
of
the
counterpane
fairy
just
appearing
above
the
counterpane
hill
oh
fairy
i
so
glad
you
came
and
i
have
the
loveliest
square
picked
out
cried
teddy
i
had
seen
it
before
because
it
was
the
other
side
of
my
knees
it
that
white
one
with
the
silver
leaves
on
it
and
my
mamma
says
it
was
a
scrap
left
from
her
wedding
dress
wait
wait
said
the
fairy
till
a
body
gets
her
breath
now
which
one
is
it
it
that
one
said
teddy
will
you
tell
me
about
it
why
yes
said
the
fairy
if
that
the
one
you
want
now
fix
your
eyes
on
it
while
i
count
then
the
counterpane
fairy
began
to
count
he
heard
her
voice
going
on
and
on
and
on
she
cried
when
teddy
looked
about
him
he
saw
that
he
was
standing
in
a
long
hall
of
white
marble
veined
with
silver
there
were
arches
and
pillars
of
silver
and
all
the
walls
were
carved
with
lilies
teddy
walked
slowly
down
this
hall
and
as
he
walked
a
rosy
glow
seemed
to
move
with
him
he
looked
down
to
see
what
made
it
and
found
that
he
was
dressed
in
a
tunic
of
silk
such
as
he
had
never
seen
before
and
it
was
fastened
about
the
waist
with
a
golden
girdle
his
feet
were
bare
but
the
air
was
so
mildly
warm
that
the
marble
did
not
chill
him
after
a
while
as
he
walked
slowly
and
wonderingly
down
the
hall
he
turned
a
corner
and
found
himself
in
another
hall
just
like
the
first
only
at
one
side
there
was
a
great
crystal
window
and
sitting
on
a
marble
seat
before
it
was
the
counterpane
fairy
herself
she
sat
quite
still
as
though
she
were
listening
and
she
paid
no
attention
to
teddy
he
was
sure
it
must
be
the
counterpane
fairy
for
it
looked
like
her
though
she
was
quite
large
now
she
looked
as
large
as
a
real
woman
teddy
stood
looking
at
her
for
a
while
and
waiting
for
her
to
see
him
but
she
paid
no
attention
and
so
at
last
he
whispered
counterpane
fairy
hush
said
she
i
listening
then
teddy
listened
too
and
as
soon
as
he
did
he
heard
a
sound
of
music
like
that
of
the
in
the
nursery
at
home
only
it
was
very
much
clearer
and
sweeter
and
fainter
it
seemed
to
come
from
outside
the
crystal
window
and
looking
through
it
teddy
saw
that
outside
was
the
most
beautiful
garden
he
had
ever
seen
the
grass
of
the
garden
was
a
silvery
green
and
the
paths
were
white
the
leaves
of
the
tress
were
lined
with
silver
and
the
branches
hung
with
shining
fruit
there
were
lilies
growing
beside
the
paths
and
in
the
centre
of
the
garden
a
fountain
leaped
and
fell
back
into
a
marble
basin
the
water
sparkled
as
though
it
were
made
of
diamonds
and
as
teddy
listened
he
knew
that
the
music
he
heard
was
the
voice
of
the
fountain
presently
it
ceased
and
then
the
fairy
turned
to
him
and
smiled
oh
counterpane
fairy
cried
teddy
may
i
go
out
into
that
garden
that
i
do
know
said
the
fairy
but
if
you
want
to
get
there
the
best
thing
for
you
to
do
is
find
starlein
and
silverling
for
they
are
the
only
ones
who
can
show
you
the
way
into
the
garden
where
are
they
asked
teddy
i
ca
tell
you
that
either
said
the
fairy
but
they
somewhere
in
the
halls
i
go
find
them
cried
teddy
and
without
waiting
any
longer
he
turned
and
ran
down
the
hall
as
fast
as
he
could
he
was
in
such
haste
to
find
them
and
get
them
to
show
him
the
way
into
the
garden
on
and
on
he
ran
through
one
hall
after
another
through
arched
doorways
and
along
echoing
corridors
until
he
felt
all
bewildered
and
out
of
breath
all
the
time
he
was
running
he
seemed
to
hear
the
music
of
the
singing
fountain
in
his
ears
but
whenever
he
stopped
to
listen
everything
was
still
he
was
so
out
of
breath
that
he
had
begun
to
walk
when
turning
another
corner
he
suddenly
saw
before
him
a
little
girl
who
he
somehow
felt
sure
was
starlein
her
hair
was
of
a
silvery
yellow
and
was
like
a
mist
about
her
head
she
was
very
beautiful
and
was
dressed
from
head
to
foot
in
silver
that
shone
and
sparkled
as
she
moved
around
her
was
flying
a
flock
of
white
doves
and
she
was
playing
with
them
and
talking
as
soon
as
she
saw
teddy
she
cried
out
oh
it
a
little
child
and
running
down
the
hall
to
him
with
her
doves
flying
about
her
she
put
her
little
hands
on
his
cheeks
and
kissed
him
then
she
stood
back
and
looked
at
him
with
her
hands
clasped
you
dear
little
boy
she
said
where
did
you
come
from
i
came
through
the
white
square
said
teddy
i
do
know
the
white
square
said
the
little
girl
but
i
glad
you
came
i
have
anyone
to
play
with
since
silverling
went
away
where
has
silverling
gone
asked
teddy
i
must
find
him
the
little
girl
shook
her
head
i
do
know
she
said
we
quarrelled
once
and
he
went
away
he
must
be
in
some
of
the
halls
but
i
been
hunting
and
hunting
ever
since
and
i
ca
find
him
then
teddy
told
her
how
the
counterpane
fairy
had
said
that
he
must
find
silverling
and
starlein
and
that
then
perhaps
he
could
get
into
the
garden
where
the
singing
fountain
was
the
little
girl
shook
her
head
again
i
am
starlein
she
said
but
i
ca
take
you
into
the
garden
because
i
have
never
found
the
gate
into
it
since
silverling
went
away
and
she
went
over
and
sat
down
on
a
marble
bench
beside
the
wall
and
all
the
doves
settled
about
her
on
her
knees
and
shoulders
never
mind
cried
teddy
bravely
you
wait
here
and
i
go
and
find
him
i
found
you
and
i
find
him
too
turning
he
ran
down
the
hall
and
through
an
arched
way
into
another
hall
and
there
far
far
down
at
the
other
end
he
saw
a
little
boy
dressed
in
silver
who
was
tossing
a
silver
ball
up
into
the
air
and
catching
it
again
when
he
saw
teddy
he
slipped
the
ball
into
his
pocket
and
ran
to
meet
him
leaping
with
delight
and
clapping
his
hands
oh
little
boy
little
boy
he
cried
will
you
come
and
play
with
me
are
you
silverling
cried
teddy
breathlessly
yes
said
the
little
boy
then
come
come
quick
cried
teddy
starlein
is
just
around
the
corner
and
she
is
waiting
for
you
to
come
and
show
us
the
way
into
the
garden
where
the
singing
fountain
is
he
caught
silverling
by
the
hand
and
without
another
word
they
ran
as
fast
as
they
could
up
the
hall
and
around
the
corner
through
the
silvery
archway
and
into
the
other
hall
there
teddy
stopped
short
looking
blankly
about
him
starlein

gone
silverling
shook
his
head
sadly
i
know
how
it
would
be

since

garden
of
the
singing
fountain

did

asked
teddy
we
quarrelled
about
this
said
the
little
boy
touching
a
slender
golden
chain
that
hung
around
his
neck
we
found
it
in
the
garden
and
we
quarrelled
about
who
should
wear
it
but
i
be
so
glad
to
give
it
to
starlein
now
if
she
would
only
come
back
again
well

said
teddy
she
ca
be
far
away
and
i
go
and
find
her
no
no
cried
silverling
you
ca

her
and
i
lose
you
too
stay
here
awhile
little
boy
and
play
with
me
for
i
very
lonely
look
let
play
with
my
silver
ball
and
taking
it
from
his
pocket
he
tossed
it
to
teddy
teddy
caught
it
and
threw
it
back
to
him
and
so
they
played
together
in
the
marble
hall
tossing
the
silver
ball
and
shouting
with
laughter
at
last
silverling
missed
the
ball
and
as
it
rolled
on
down
the
hall
he
ran
after
it
stooping
and
trying
to
catch
it
but
always
just
missing
teddy
shouted
and
clapped
his
hands
jumping
up
and
down
with
his
bare
feet
and
then
he
stood
still
watching
silverling
as
he
ran
far
far
down
the
hall
as
he
stood
thus
suddenly
he
heard
from
just
around
the
corner
the
cooing
of
starlein
doves
he
did
not
stop
a
moment
but
turning
ran
around
into
the
next
hall
and
there
sure
enough
was
starlein
with
her
doves
about
her
oh
little
boy
she
cried
i
was
afraid
i
had
lost
you
but
teddy
caught
her
by
the
hand
come
quick
he
cried
i
have
found
silverling
they
ran
together
into
the
hall
where
a
moment
ago
silverling
had
been
playing
with
the
silver
ball
but
it
was
vacant
now
silverling
was
gone
well
i
never
said
teddy
then
he
turned
to
starlein
starlein
you
should
have
gone
away
when
i
told
you
not
to
i
did
said
starlein
i
stayed
right
there
teddy
thought
awhile
then
it
must
have
been
the
wrong
hall
he
said
but
never
mind
i
find
him
again
and
this
time
i
surely
bring
him
to
you
only
wait
here
no
matter
how
long
it
is
stop
oh
stop
cried
starlein
she
caught
one
of
her
doves
in
her
hands
and
held
it
out
to
teddy
here
little
boy
she
said
take
this
with
you
and
if
you
ca
find
me
again
give
it
to
silverling
and
tell
him
he
is
to
keep
it
for
his
very
own
yes
i
will
said
teddy
and
he
took
the
dove
and
put
it
in
the
bosom
of
his
tunic
and
it
nestled
there
all
warm
and
soft
and
still
then
he
turned
and
walked
quietly
down
the
hall
and
into
another
he
went
on
and
on
but
he
did
not
run
and
jump
now
for
he
was
thinking
after
a
while
when
he
turned
into
another
hall
he
once
more
saw
silverling
at
play
with
his
silver
ball
did
you
find
her
cried
silverling
eagerly
yes
said
teddy
i
found
her
and
she
sent
you
a
dove
for
your
very
own
but
silverling
i
think
this
i
think
the
only
way
for
us
ever
to
find
her
together
is
for
us
to
set
the
dove
free
and
to
follow
it
when
it
flies
back
to
her
but
we
could
follow
it
said
silverling
it
would
fly
so
fast
that
it
would
be
out
of
sight
in
a
minute
i
know
said
teddy
but
we
could
tie
something
to
it
what
could
we
fasten
to
it
asked
silverling
the
two
little
boys
stood
looking
about
them
and
wondering
what
they
could
use
suddenly
teddy
clapped
his
hands
so
the
dove
in
his
tunic
started
we
fasten
the
end
of
your
golden
chain
to
it
he
cried
no
sooner
said
than
done
in
a
moment
silverling
had
taken
the
chain
from
his
neck
and
unfastened
the
ends
it
was
so
long
that
it
had
been
twisted
several
times
around
his
neck
very
gently
they
took
the
dove
and
fastened
the
chain
to
its
leg
and
then
they
let
it
go
it
fluttered
up
over
their
heads
and
circled
about
them
once
or
twice
and
then
it
flew
on
down
the
hall
with
the
little
boys
following
it
they
turned
many
a
corner
and
went
through
many
a
door
and
at
last
they
came
into
a
hall
and
there
there
was
starlein
waiting
for
them
with
her
doves
about
her
oh
starlein
cried
silverling
oh
silverling
cried
starlein
they
ran
to
each
other
and
threw
their
arms
about
each
other
necks
and
kissed
while
the
white
doves
flew
circling
about
them
then
they
told
each
other
how
sorry
they
were
that
they
had
quarrelled
and
that
they
would
never
do
it
any
more
and
then
they
kissed
again
and
you
may
have
the
golden
chain
starlein
said
silverling
no
no
you
must
keep
it
said
starlein
oh
i
know
what
we
do
cried
silverling
we
give
it
to
this
little
boy
because
if
it
had
been
for
him
we
would
have
found
each
other
oh
yes
said
starlein
but
teddy
held
up
his
hand
hush
he
whispered
do
you
hear
it
then
they
all
listened
and
sweeter
and
clearer
than
ever
before
they
heard
the
voice
of
the
singing
fountain
in
the
beautiful
garden
it
is
the
fountain
cried
starlein
and
silverling
half
fearfully
they
each
caught
teddy
by
the
hand
and
all
ran
down
the
hall
together
and
the
very
first
corner
that
they
turned
they
found
themselves
at
the
door
of
the
garden
the
wind
was
blowing
the
lilies
the
fruit
on
the
wonderful
trees
shone
and
glistened
in
the
sunlight
and
the
fountain
ah
the
fountain
was
no
longer
singing
for
the
in
the
nursery
had
run
down
teddy
looked
about
him
instead
of
the
garden
there
was
the
flowery
the
clock
ticked
the
fire
crackled
he
was
back
in
bed
once
more
and
he
heard
mamma
speaking
to
hannah
in
the
hall
outside
so
he
knew
she
was
home
again
and
that
is
the
end
of
that
story
said
the
fairy
of
the
counterpane
chapter
fourth
the
magic
circus
teddy
was
still
in
bed
though
the
doctor
had
said
that
very
soon
he
might
have
the
big
chair
wheeled
up
to
the
window
and
sit
there
awhile
now
he
was
propped
up
against
the
pillows
playing
with
the
paper
circus
his
mother
had
brought
to
him
the
day
before
his
little
cousin
harriett
had
come
in
yesterday
to
spend
the
afternoon
with
him
and
together
they
had
cut
out
the
figures
the
clown
the
the
pretty
lady
on
the
white
horse
the
acrobat
on
his
steed
and
all
the
rest
this
morning
he
had
put
some
large
books
under
the
bedquilt
and
smoothed
it
over
them
so
as
to
make
a
flat
plane
and
was
amusing
himself
setting
the
circus
out
and
arranging
his
soldiers
in
a
long
procession
as
if
they
were
the
audience
coming
to
see
it
he
seemed
so
well
entertained
that
his
mother
said
she
would
go
over
to
the
for
a
little
while
to
run
up
some
seams
on
the
machine
when
teddy
was
left
alone
he
still
went
on
playing
very
happily
but
as
he
set
out
the
soldiers
two
by
two
he
was
really
thinking
of
the
counterpane
fairy
and
her
wonderful
stories
the
evening
before
he
had
fallen
asleep
while
his
mother
was
reading
something
to
his
father
for
they
both
sat
in
teddy
room
in
the
evenings
now
that
he
was
ill
and
when
he
woke
they
were
talking
together
about
him
they
did
not
see
that
his
eyes
were
open
so
they
went
on
with
what
they
were
saying
it
was
his
mother
who
was
speaking
he
such
an
odd
child
she
was
saying
just
now
he
is
full
of
this
idea
of
the
counterpane
fairy
and
her
stories
and
he
talks
of
her
just
as
though
she
were
real
i
do
know
where
he
got
the
idea
it
is
in
any
of
his
book
and
i
thought
you
must
have
been
telling
him
about
it
no
said
papa
i
did
tell
him
perhaps
it
was
harriett
said
mamma
and
then
she
saw
that
he
was
awake
and
began
to
speak
of
something
else
teddy
wished
his
mother
could
see
the
counterpane
fairy
herself
and
then
she
would
know
that
it
was
a
real
fairy
and
not
a
when
he
saw
the
counterpane
fairy
again
he
was
going
to
ask
her
if
he
might
take
his
mother
into
one
of
the
stories
with
him
he
was
thinking
of
her
so
hard
that
it
did
not
surprise
him
at
all
to
hear
her
little
thin
voice
just
back
of
the
counterpane
hill
oh
dear
dear
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
i
hardly
get
to
the
top
before
i
have
to
come
down
again
is
that
you
counterpane
fairy
called
teddy
yes
it
is
said
the
fairy
i
be
there
in
a
minute
and
soon
she
appeared
above
the
top
of
the
hill
and
seated
herself
on
it
to
rest
and
catch
her
breath
dear
dear
she
said
but
it
a
steep
hill
fairy
said
teddy
i
want
to
ask
you
something
you
know
my
mother
yes
said
the
counterpane
fairy
i
know
who
she
is
well
said
teddy
she
just
gone
over
into
the
and
i
want
to
know
whether
you
wo
let
me
take
her
into
a
square
sometime
my
mercy
no
said
the
fairy
have
you
forgotten
what
i
told
you
the
first
time
i
came
what
was
that
i
told
you
i
went
to
see
little
boys
and
girls
i
do
go
to
see
grown
people
they
would
believe
in
me
my
mother
would
said
teddy
she
plays
with
me
and
she
likes
my
books
and
i
tell
her
all
about
you
no
no
cried
the
counterpane
fairy
i
could
think
of
it
very
glad
to
take
you
into
my
stories
but
if
you
do
care
to
go
by
yourself
and
she
picked
up
her
staff
and
rose
as
though
she
were
going
oh
i
do
i
do
cried
teddy
please
do
go
away
well
i
wo
said
the
fairy
sitting
down
again
if
you
really
want
me
to
show
you
another
have
you
chosen
a
square
no
i
have
yet
said
teddy
he
looked
the
squares
over
very
carefully
and
at
last
he
chose
the
one
where
the
circus
was
standing
very
good
said
the
fairy
now
i
going
to
begin
to
count
teddy
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
square
and
she
commenced
gradually
he
began
to
feel
as
though
the
white
silk
of
the
square
was
a
pale
cloudy
sky
before
him
stretched
a
white
streak
and
in
the
distance
were
some
things
like
black
squares
he
did
not
know
quite
what
cried
the
fairy
when
teddy
looked
about
him
he
and
the
counterpane
fairy
were
journeying
along
a
dusty
white
road
together
and
the
fairy
looked
just
as
any
little
old
woman
might
except
that
her
eyes
were
so
bright
behind
her
spectacles
before
them
lay
a
city
with
black
roofs
and
spires
there
was
a
sound
of
drums
and
music
in
the
distance
and
a
faint
noise
as
though
a
crowd
of
people
were
shouting
a
great
way
off
what
are
they
doing
over
there
asked
teddy
hurrying
his
steps
a
little
is
it
a
parade
no
said
the
fairy
it
not
a
parade
but
it
is
a
grand
merrymaking
and
it
because
of
it
that
i
brought
you
here
but
i
tired
and
hungry
for
we
come
a
long
way
so
let
us
sit
down
by
the
roadside
a
bit
and
while
we
rest
i
tell
you
all
about
the
goings
on
and
what
we
have
to
do
with
them
teddy
was
quite
willing
so
he
and
the
counterpane
fairy
sat
down
together
on
the
soft
grass
beside
the
road
with
the
mild
and
misty
sky
overhead
and
the
fairy
took
from
her
pocket
a
piece
of
bread
and
cheese
she
broke
it
in
half
and
one
part
she
gave
to
teddy
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
tasted
anything
so
good
for
as
the
fairy
remarked
they
were
both
of
them
hungry
after
they
had
finished
it
all
to
the
very
last
bit
the
fairy
brushed
the
crumbs
from
her
lap
and
sitting
there
with
the
soft
wind
blowing
about
them
and
the
black
roofs
of
the
city
in
the
distance
the
counterpane
fairy
told
him
the
story
of
the
king
of
the
and
the
princess
aureline
far
off
yonder
toward
the
east
where
the
sky
looks
so
pale
and
bright
began
the
fairy
there
lives
a
king
who
is
called
king
whitebeard
because
his
beard
is
as
white
as
snow
he
had
only
one
child
a
daughter
named
the
princess
aureline
and
she
was
as
beautiful
as
the
day
and
as
good
as
she
was
beautiful
because
she
was
so
good
and
beautiful
princes
used
to
come
from
all
over
the
world
seeking
her
hand
in
marriage
and
among
them
came
the
king
of
the
the
richest
and
most
powerful
of
them
all
the
princess
aureline
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
him
however
because
he
was
wicked
as
well
as
rich
so
at
last
the
king
of
the
gathered
his
army
together
and
marching
against
king
whitebeard
he
conquered
him
and
carried
off
the
princess
aureline
captive
now
there
are
great
rejoicings
in
the
black
king
country
but
the
princess
aureline
sits
and
grieves
all
the
time
and
nothing
the
king
can
do
can
make
her
smile
the
more
the
black
king
does
the
more
she
grieves
but
she
is
so
very
beautiful
that
the
king
would
deny
her
nothing
except
to
let
her
go
home
to
her
father
i
should
like
to
see
a
princess
said
teddy
so
you
shall
said
the
fairy
for
you
are
a
great
magician
now
and
you
have
come
here
to
do
what
no
other
hero
in
the
world
dares
to
do
you
have
come
to
rescue
the
princess
aureline
and
carry
her
back
to
her
own
country
do
you
mean
i
am
a
real
magician
asked
teddy
why
yes
said
the
fairy
do
you
see
you
are
dressed
in
a
magician
robe
and
there
is
your
on
the
grass
beside
you
look
so
saying
the
fairy
drew
a
mirror
of
polished
steel
from
under
her
cloak
and
held
it
up
before
teddy
and
as
he
looked
into
it
he
hardly
knew
himself
he
was
dressed
in
a
black
hood
and
a
long
black
robe
strangely
woven
about
the
hem
with
characters
in
white
and
he
held
a
white
staff
in
his
hand
beside
him
on
the
grass
was
a
box
bound
round
with
iron
and
that
was
his
after
he
had
looked
in
the
mirror
for
a
while
the
fairy
hid
it
away
again
under
her
cloak
now
come
she
said
for
it
is
time
we
were
journeying
on
but
what
have
i
in
my
box
asked
teddy
as
he
picked
it
up
and
joined
the
fairy
who
was
already
hobbling
along
toward
the
city
do
you
remember
said
the
fairy
it
your
circus
oh
yes
i
remember
now
said
teddy
after
a
while
he
and
the
fairy
reached
the
city
and
everywhere
along
the
street
were
people
laughing
and
dancing
and
feasting
and
all
the
houses
were
hung
with
white
and
black
flags
the
black
flags
were
for
the
king
of
the
and
the
white
flags
were
for
the
princess
aureline
everywhere
they
came
the
people
made
way
for
them
and
whispered
look
look
that
is
the
great
magician
who
had
come
to
show
his
magic
before
the
princess
aureline
at
last
they
reached
an
open
square
and
there
was
the
greatest
crowd
of
all
on
a
raised
platform
covered
with
silver
cloth
and
with
steps
leading
up
to
it
were
two
thrones
upon
one
of
the
thrones
sat
a
tall
man
dressed
in
black
velvet
and
with
a
crown
upon
his
head
cut
entirely
from
one
great
black
diamond
upon
the
other
throne
sat
a
beautiful
young
princess
she
was
as
pale
as
a
lily
and
as
beautiful
as
the
day
and
was
dressed
in
shimmering
white
her
hands
were
clasped
in
her
lap
and
her
face
was
very
sad
on
the
steps
that
led
to
this
platform
stood
two
heralds
in
black
and
white
with
trumpets
in
their
hands
and
all
about
were
ranged
soldiers
two
and
two
they
made
teddy
think
of
the
toy
soldiers
he
had
been
playing
with
only
they
were
as
big
as
men
and
instead
of
being
gay
with
red
paint
they
were
in
black
as
soon
as
teddy
and
the
counterpane
fairy
appeared
in
this
square
the
two
heralds
blew
a
loud
blast
and
come
down
to
meet
them
make
way
make
way
for
the
magician
they
cried
and
they
escorted
him
and
the
fairy
through
the
crowd
to
the
foot
of
the
steps
the
king
of
the
stared
at
him
and
his
eyes
were
so
black
and
piercing
that
teddy
felt
afraid
are
you
the
great
magician
he
asked
yes
i
am
answered
teddy
bowing
then
let
us
see
some
of
this
magic
that
we
have
been
hearing
about
said
the
king
and
harkye
magician
if
you
can
make
the
princess
smile
you
shall
have
whatsoever
you
wish
even
to
the
half
of
my
treasure
teddy
bowed
again
and
then
he
set
the
chest
on
the
ground
and
drawing
from
his
girdle
an
iron
key
he
unlocked
it
and
put
back
the
lid
there
was
the
paper
circus
just
as
he
and
harriett
had
cut
it
out
the
acrobat
and
the
lovely
lady
the
horses
the
clown
the
not
one
of
them
was
left
out
with
his
magic
wand
teddy
drew
upon
the
ground
a
circle
and
then
while
everybody
round
craned
and
stretched
their
necks
to
see
what
he
was
about
he
took
out
the
figures
and
set
them
one
by
one
in
the
ring
then
he
waved
his
wand
over
them
and
cried
all
the
people
stood
on
tiptoes
and
the
king
himself
leaned
forward
to
see
but
nothing
happened
cried
teddy
again
still
nothing
happened
he
looked
around
at
the
crowd
of
people
at
the
soldiers
and
the
king
and
his
heart
sank
he
cried
for
the
third
time
striking
the
ground
with
his
wand
then
a
wonderful
thing
happened
the
circle
he
had
drawn
upon
the
ground
began
to
spread
just
as
a
circle
does
in
the
water
after
one
has
thrown
a
stone
into
it
now
it
was
a
great
circus
ring
and
the
paper
circus
itself
had
changed
to
a
real
circus
the
clown
walked
about
joking
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
the
cracked
him
whip
the
paper
horses
were
two
magnificent
steeds
one
as
black
as
night
and
one
as
white
as
milk
that
cantered
round
and
round
while
the
music
sounded
and
all
the
people
far
away
on
the
outside
of
the
ring
clapped
and
applauded
wonderful
wonderful
cried
the
king
of
the
but
now
there
was
something
more
that
was
wonderful
as
the
black
horse
cantered
round
teddy
ran
to
him
and
leaped
upon
his
back
light
as
a
feather
and
there
he
rode
his
black
robe
with
the
white
figures
flying
and
fluttering
around
him
then
still
riding
around
he
unfastened
his
gown
and
threw
it
from
him
and
there
he
was
dressed
in
white
and
silver
and
his
magic
wand
was
changed
to
a
little
silver
whip
after
that
he
leaped
up
into
the
air
and
turned
a
somersault
lighting
again
upon
his
horse
while
the
music
played
louder
and
louder
teddy
rode
round
and
round
now
riding
backward
now
forward
now
on
one
foot
now
on
his
hands
with
his
feet
in
the
air
then
he
leaped
upright
and
putting
his
fingers
to
his
mouth
he
gave
a
shrill
whistle
at
that
the
white
steed
suddenly
dashed
into
the
ring
and
galloped
up
beside
the
black
one
and
now
teddy
rode
with
a
foot
on
each
faster
and
faster
he
rode
crying
and
even
the
king
clapped
his
hands
once
and
twice
he
rode
round
the
ring
and
past
the
platform
but
as
they
came
round
for
the
third
time
teddy
waved
his
whip
in
the
air
he
cried
up
up
with
that
his
steeds
suddenly
leaped
from
the
ring
and
up
the
steps
of
the
platform
to
the
very
top
there
teddy
sprang
from
them
and
caught
the
princess
aureline
by
the
hand
i
have
come
to
rescue
you
he
cried
and
before
the
king
could
move
or
speak
he
had
set
her
upon
the
white
horse
he
had
sprung
upon
the
black
and
with
a
clatter
of
hoofs
they
were
dashing
down
the
steps
and
across
the
square
then
the
king
of
the
started
to
his
feet
stop
them
stop
them
he
cried
the
soldiers
had
been
standing
as
though
turned
to
stone
but
at
the
king
voice
they
started
forward
reaching
out
to
catch
the
bridles
of
the
horses
but
again
teddy
raised
his
magic
whip
as
you
were
once
you
shall
be
he
cried
at
the
magic
words
every
soldier
arm
fell
by
his
side
their
eyes
changed
to
little
black
dots
their
faces
grew
rounder
their
legs
stiffened
and
there
they
stood
nothing
more
nor
less
than
wooden
soldiers
just
like
the
one
were
they
his
own
soldiers
and
the
princess
was
she
only
the
doll
that
harriett
had
forgotten
the
night
before
and
that
teddy
had
set
up
against
his
knees
to
watch
the
show
were
the
streets
only
black
and
white
silk
there
he
was
back
in
his
own
room
with
the
little
wooden
soldiers
and
the
paper
circus
there
was
the
square
of
silk
with
the
book
under
it
and
the
counterpane
fairy
sitting
on
his
knees
oh
but
counterpane
fairy
cried
teddy
what
became
of
us
did
we
get
away
oh
i
did
want
to
come
out
of
the
story
just
yet
why
of
course
you
escaped
said
the
fairy
how
could
the
king
stop
you
after
you
had
changed
his
soldiers
into
wood
and
what
became
of
you
asked
teddy
oh
i
took
the
clown
cap

the
fairy
for
it
was
the
and
fast
as
you
and
the
princess
rode
back
to
the
country
of
king
whitebeard
i
was
there
before
you
teddy
thought
for
a
while
and
then
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
i
wish
i
really
had
a
circus
horse
he
said
and
could
ride
round
and
have
all
the
people
watching
and
shouting
but
what
did
the
princess
say
when
she
found
i
had
rescued
her
hark
said
the
fairy
is
that

mother
coming
along
the
hall

hill

polar
sea

standing
at
the
window
and

that
blackbird
i
always
feel
as
though
spring
were
really
here
when
i
hear
the
blackbirds
sing
teddy
was
still
in
bed
it
seemed
to
him
sometimes
that
he
had
spent
his
whole
life
lying
there
in
the
under
the
silk
counterpane
and
that
it
was
some
other
teddy
who
used
to
go
to
school
and
shout
and
play
with
the
boys
in
the
street
i
wish
i
could
go
the
way

said
mamma
but
never

nice
game
or
other
that
you
can
play
in

now
what
would
you
like
it
to
be
but
before
teddy
could
answer
she
added
oh
dear
there
comes
aunt
mariah
aunt
mariah
lived
down
at
the
other
end
of
the
village
and
she
generally
came
every
fortnight
to
spend
an
afternoon
with
mother
she
always
brought
her
knitting
in
a
bag
and
a
white
net
cap
that
she
put
on
before
the
glass
as
soon
as
she
had
taken
her
bonnet
off
teddy
liked
to
have
her
come
her
needles
flew
so
fast
and
she
used
to
recite
to
him
a
was
an
archer
and
shot
at
a
frog
b
was
a
butcher
and
had
a
great
dog
then
when
he
was
tired
of
sitting
with
her
and
mamma
he
could
run
and
play
but
he
found
it
was
different
from
what
it
had
been
before
he
was
still
weak
from
his
illness
and
after
she
had
told
him
all
the
verses
that
she
knew
he
grew
weary
of
hearing
her
talk
of
cousin
george
wife
and
appleby
rheumatism
his
mother
saw
that
he
was
growing
restless
and
that
his
cheeks
were
flushed
so
she
asked
aunt
mariah
to
come
over
to
her
room
to
look
at
some
calico
she
had
been
buying
when
they
had
gone
teddy
lay
for
a
time
enjoying
the
silence
of
the
room
but
after
a
while
it
began
to
seem
too
still
and
the
clock
ticked
with
a
strange
loud
sound
he
wished
aunt
mariah
would
go
away
and
let
mamma
come
back
again
it
was
so
lonely
and
he
was
tired
of
his
books
he
was
lying
on
his
back
and
presently
he
drew
up
his
knees
and
then
over
the
tops
of
them
he
could
only
see
the
upper
half
of
the
window
and
the
tips
of
the
against
the
still
blue
sky
outside
oh
dear
dear
dear
said
the
counterpane
fairy
voice
just
behind
the
hill
steeper
than
ever
will
i
ever
get
to
the
top
a
minute
after
he
saw
her
little
figure
standing
on
the
hill
dark
against
the
sky
and
the
staff
in
her
hand
like
a
thin
black
line
oh
dear
counterpane
fairy
cried
teddy
have
you
come
to
show
me
another
story
are
you
sure
you
want
to
see
one
asked
the
counterpane
fairy
oh
yes
yes
i
do
cried
teddy
your
stories
do
make
me
feel
tired
the
way
aunt
mariah
do
the
fairy
shook
her
head
i
thought
her
stories
were
very
pleasant
she
said
so
they
are
said
teddy
but
i
like
her
stories
best
when
i
all
well
and
i
like
your
stories
best
when
i
sick
besides
i
only
hear
her
stories
and
i
see
yours
the
fairy
smiled
well
then
which
square
will
you
choose
this
time
she
said
i
think
i
would
like
that
one
said
teddy
pointing
to
a
square
of
watered
ribbon
that
shaded
from
white
to
a
that
rather
a
long
story
said
the
fairy
doubtfully
oh
please
show
it
begged
teddy
well
said
the
fairy
fix
your
eyes
on
it
while
i
count
then
she
began
and
he
heard
her
voice
going
on
and
on
she
cried
teddy
was
floating
on
a
block
of
ice
across
the
wide
green
polar
sea
the
counterpane
fairy
was
with
him
and
all
around
were
great
fields
of
ice
and
floating
white
bergs
the
air
was
very
still
and
cold
but
teddy
liked
it
all
the
better
for
that
for
now
he
was
an
he
was
dressed
from
head
to
foot
in
a
suit
that
shone
and
sparkled
like
woven
frost
and
in
his
belt
was
a
knife
as
shining
as
an
icicle
something
kept
bobbing
and
tickling
his
forehead
and
when
he
caught
hold
of
it
he
found
it
was
the
end
of
the
long
cap
he
wore
as
they
drifted
along
sometimes
they
saw
a
walrus
with
long
tusks
lying
on
the
ice
or
a
seal
once
some
strange
little
beings
that
looked
like
dwarfs
with
goggle
eyes
and
straggling
black
hair
caught
hold
of
the
block
of
ice
and
lifting
themselves
out
of
the
water
made
faces
at
teddy
but
the
moment
they
saw
the
counterpane
fairy
their
looked
changed
to
one
of
fear
and
with
a
queer
gurgling
cry
they
dropped
from
the
ice
and
were
gone
what
were
those
things
asked
teddy
they
were
said
the
counterpane
fairy
naughty
mischievous
things
they
are
i
like
to
pack
them
all
off
to
the
north
pole
if
i
could
oh
look
look
cried
teddy
just
look
at
those
little
bears
playing
over
there
they
had
drifted
in
quite
near
to
the
shore
and
in
among
the
blocks
of
ice
three
white
bear
cubs
were
playing
together
like
fat
little
boys
they
were
climbing
to
the
top
of
an
and
then
sliding
down
again
as
soon
as
they
saw
teddy
and
the
counterpane
fairy
they
began
to
call
oh
father
bear
father
bear
just
come
look
at
these
funny
things
floating
in
to
shore
on
a
block
of
ice
in
a
moment
from
behind
the
came
a
great
white
father
bear
galloping
up
as
fast
as
he
could
to
see
what
the
matter
was
he
came
over
toward
teddy
growling
who
are
you
coming
and
frightening
my
little
bears
this
way
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
counterpane
fairy
he
grew
quite
humble
oh
excuse
me
he
said
i
did
know
it
was
a
friend
of
yours
yes
it
is
said
the
fairy
and
i
have
brought
him
here
to
stay
awhile
will
you
take
good
care
of
him
yes
i
will
said
father
bear
he
shall
sleep
in
the
cave
with
us
and
have
part
of
our
meat
if
he
will
and
i
will
be
as
careful
of
him
as
though
he
were
one
of
my
own
cubs
very
well
said
the
fairy
mind
you
do
then
turning
to
teddy
she
bade
him
step
on
shore
but
are
you
coming
too
asked
teddy
no
said
the
counterpane
fairy
i
ca
come
but
father
bear
will
take
good
care
of
you
so
teddy
stepped
onto
the
shore
and
the
fairy
pushed
the
block
of
ice
out
into
the
water
and
waving
her
hand
to
him
she
drifted
away
across
the
open
sea
the
father
bear
stood
watching
her
until
she
was
out
of
sight
and
then
he
turned
to
teddy
now
you
fairy
he
said
you
may
climb
up
onto
my
back
and
i
carry
you
to
my
wife
she
take
good
care
of
you
for
as
long
as
the
counterpane
fairy
chooses
to
leave
you
here
the
three
little
bears
cubs
had
disappeared
but
as
soon
as
the
father
bear
carried
teddy
around
the
hill
of
ice
he
saw
what
had
become
of
them
they
were
sitting
with
the
mother
bear
at
the
door
of
a
cave
one
of
them
was
sucking
its
paws
and
the
other
two
were
talking
as
fast
as
they
could
the
mother
bear
looked
worried
and
anxious
what
all
this
dumpy
and
sprawley
are
telling
me
she
said
and
what
that
you
have
on
your
back
it
an
growled
old
father
bear
and
the
counterpane
fairy
wants
us
to
take
care
of
it
for
a
while
you
do
mind
my
dear
do
you
oh
dear
dear
said
the
mother
bear
i
suppose
not
but
what
shall
we
give
it
to
eat
and
how
shall
we
keep
it
oh
it
will
do
just
the
other
cubs

suppose
said
the
father
bear
then
turning
to
teddy
he
said
you
eat
meat
do
you
yes

answered
teddy
timidly
then
that
all
right
said
the
father
bear
here
you
children
take
this
fairy
off
and
let
him
play
with
you
two

the
little
bears

who
was
the
one
who
had
been
sucking
his
paws
and
dumpy
were
delighted
to
have
a
new
playmate
and
they
told
him
he
might
come
over
and
slide
down
their
hill
but
the
third
one
sprawley
scowled
and
grumbled
another
one
to
be
eating
up
our
meat
he
said
just
as
if
there
were
enough
of
us
without
still
he
went
over
with
them
to
the
icehill
and
they
all
began
sliding
down
after
a
while
sprawley
said

a
little
farther

said
fatty
but
suppose
we
should
see
some
pooh
said
sprawley
i
ai
afraid
it
a
great
deal
nicer
than
this
come
on
so
the
three
little
bears
and
teddy
trotted
on
to
another
hill
and
it
really
was
much
longer
and
steeper
than
the
other
it
went
down
almost
to
the
edge
of
the
sea
they
had
slidden
down
it
only
a
few
times
when
dumpy
cried
out
oh
look
look
there
are
some
and
they
are
making
faces
at
me
there
they
were
sure
enough
looking
over
the
edge
of
the
ice
ugly
little
gray
things
with
mouths
like
fishes
and
they
were
making
faces
and
presently
they
began
to
sing
bear
cubs
bear
cubs
look
at
their
toes
look
at
their
ears
and
their
hair
and
their
nose
the
great
big
walrus
will
surely
come
to
eat
up
the
bear
cubs
and
give
us
some
dumpy
growled
at
them
though
he
was
frightened
but
fatty
began
to
cry
just
then
one
of
the
mermen
sent
a
piece
of
ice
sliding
across
at
them
and
it
hit
fatty
paws
and
upset
her
she
was
so
fat
that
she
rolled
over
and
over
before
she
could
get
up
dumpy
ran
to
her
and
as
soon
as
she
was
on
her
feet
again
they
began
galloping
toward
home
as
fast
as
they
could
followed
by
sprawley
and
teddy
as
they
ran
along
teddy
saw
that
sprawley
was
shaking
all
over
and
he
thought
it
was
because
he
was
afraid
until
he
caught
up
to
him
then
he
saw
that
he
was
laughing
what
are
you
laughing
at
he
asked
but
sprawley
only
showed
his
teeth
and
growled
in
answer
when
they
reached
the
cave
and
told
the
mother
bear
about
the
mermen
she
scolded
them
well
for
going
so
near
the
edge
of
the
water
and
said
it
was
time
for
them
to
go
to
bed
father
bear
was
going
on
a
hunt
the
next
day
and
he
was
going
to
let
the
cubs
go
part
of
the
way
with
him
so
they
must
have
a
good
rest
the
mother
bear
gave
them
each
their
share
of
seal
meat
and
then
she
went
into
the
cave
oh
fatty
said
sprawley
just
look
behind
you
and
see
if
you
see
a
merman
fatty
turned
her
head
but
there
was
nothing
there
when
she
looked
back
again
she
burst
into
a
loud
whine
she
cried
sprawley
stole
my
nicest
piece
of
meat
so
he
did
out
shuffled
mother
bear
in
a
hurry
you
naughty
cub
she
cried
aiming
a
blow
at
sprawley
ear
but
quick
as
a
wink
sprawley
slipped
behind
dumpy
and
it
was
upon
dumpy
that
the
blow
fell
and
now
dumpy
joined
in
with
his
sister
he
cried
there
there
cried
the
poor
mother
bear
do
you
cry
any
more
and
i
give
you
each
an
extra
piece
of
meat
so
they
stopped
crying
and
ate
their
suppers
contentedly
and
after
that
they
all
went
to
bed
and
the
little
cubs
had
hardly
lain
down
before
they
were
fast
asleep
teddy
did
not
go
to
sleep
however
he
lay
looking
at
the
of
the
cave
and
thinking
how
strange
it
was
to
be
there
presently
he
heard
the
mother
bear
say
very
softly
husband
husband
are
you
awake
yes
i
am
said
the
father
bear
what
do
you
want
the
mother
bear
sighed
i
do
know
how
it
is
husband
she
said
but
i
never
had
a
cub
like
sprawley
before
he
is
so
naughty
and
mischievous
that
he
keeps
his
little
brother
and
sister
whining
all
the
time
you
ought
to
box
him
said
the
father
bear
that
all
very
well
said
the
mother
bear
but
when
i
try
to
box
him
he
slips
behind
the
others
and
pushes
them
forward
and
he
is
so
quick
that
twice
i
have
boxed
dumpy
instead
of
him
by
mistake
the
father
bear
grunted
and
they
were
silent
for
a
while
but
presently
the
mother
bear
began
again
more
softly
than
ever
do
you
know
husband
sometimes
i
wonder
whether
sprawley
can
really
be
my
cub
if
i
could
only
count
them
i
might
find
out
if
there
were
only
one
and
one
i
could
count
them
but
there
are
more
than
one
and
one
well
said
father
bear
i
should
think
that
would
be
easy
let
see
there
dumpy
and
he
one
and
fatty
and
she
one
and
sprawley
and
he
one
and
now
how
many
does
that
make
oh
dear
said
the
mother
bear
do
ask
me
my
head
all
of
a
whirl
already
then
you
better
go
to
sleep
my
dear
said
her
husband
the
next
thing
you
know
you
be
having
a
headache
you
think
too
much
yes
said
the
mother
bear
sighing
that
so
i
suppose
i
do
think
too
much
but
then
i
ca
help
it
i
always
was
thinking
ever
since
i
was
a
cub
it
the
way
i
made
said
the
father
bear
and
then
they
too
went
to
sleep
teddy
seemed
to
be
the
only
one
left
awake
dumpy
kept
crowding
up
against
him
and
snoring
with
his
nose
close
to
teddy
ear
teddy
pushed
him
once
or
twice
but
it
did
seem
to
make
any
difference
once
he
poked
him
so
hard
that
the
little
bear
gave
a
snort
and
stopped
snoring
for
a
while
but
soon
he
began
again
but
after
all
teddy
found
he
was
not
the
only
one
in
the
cave
who
was
not
asleep
sprawley
who
was
lying
on
the
other
side
of
fatty
had
began
to
stir
and
sit
up
he
looked
about
at
the
sleeping
bears
and
then
very
quietly
began
to
edge
himself
toward
the
mouth
of
the
cave
once
the
mother
bear
gave
a
low
growl
in
her
sleep
and
sprawley
stopped
still
to
listen
but
she
did
waken
teddy
wondered
what
sprawley
was
going
to
do
and
so
as
soon
as
the
cub
had
disappeared
through
the
mouth
of
the
cave
he
too
crawled
over
to
the
opening
when
he
looked
out
he
saw
sprawley
shuffling
over
the
fields
of
ice
in
the
distance
and
already
quite
far
away
so
led
by
his
curiosity
teddy
too
crept
out
of
the
cave
and
set
off
running
after
the
bear
cub
he
ran
on
and
on
until
he
was
quite
close
to
sprawley
and
then
he
saw
the
cub
pause
at
the
edge
of
a
strip
of
open
water
and
turn
to
look
behind
him
to
make
sure
that
he
was
not
followed
he
did
not
see
teddy
for
the
fairy
had
hidden
quickly
behind
a
block
of
ice
sprawley
turned
toward
the
water
again
and
gave
a
long
quavering
cry
that
sounded
like
a
call
he
listened
but
everything
was
silent
except
for
the
rumbling
and
cracking
of
the
ice
in
the
distance
again
he
called
and
this
time
there
was
an
answering
cry
and
another
and
another
sprawley
stood
up
and
waved
his
paws
and
then
teddy
saw
that
the
open
water
was
dotted
with
heads
of
there
must
have
been
ten
or
twelve
of
them
at
least
they
swam
over
to
where
sprawley
stood
and
climbing
out
on
the
ice
they
seemed
to
be
welcoming
him
hopping
and
sliding
about
and
pulling
at
his
hair
and
claws
now
that
teddy
saw
them
quite
close
they
were
uglier
than
ever
with
goggle
eyes
and
rough
skins
they
all
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
ice
and
now
and
then
one
of
them
would
dive
off
to
reappear
again
all
wet
and
glistening
and
then
it
would
climb
up
and
sit
on
the
ice
again
in
a
row
with
the
others
they
all
talked
together
and
their
voices
were
so
queer
and
husky
that
teddy
could
not
understand
what
they
were
saying
at
first
at
last
he
made
out
that
they
were
asking
sprawley
about
him
where
he
had
come
from
and
how
well
i
tell
you
how
he
came
said
sprawley
and
all
the
mermen
stopped
to
listen
sprawley
too
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
he
said
in
a
low
impressive
voice
the
counterpane
fairy
brought
him
there
was
a
long
quavering
cry
from
the
mermen
and
several
of
them
dived
off
into
the
water
and
did
not
reappear
again
for
some
minutes
when
they
did
their
faces
were
all
wrinkled
up
with
anxiety
they
climbed
up
onto
the
edge
of
the
ice
and
sat
there
blinking
at
the
sky
for
a
while
in
silence
then
one
of
them
said
in
a
trembling
voice
well
we
have
been
doing
anything
but
just
frightening
the
bear
cubs
a
little
how
about
knocking
fatty
down
with
a
piece
of
ice
asked
sprawley
derisively
scritchy
did
that
cried
all
the
mermen
but
one
we
did
do
it
scritchy
did
that
the
merman
who
had
spoken
and
who
was
scritchy
still
did
not
say
a
word
he
looked
at
the
others
with
his
goggle
eyes
and
then
he
tumbled
off
into
the
water
and
swam
away
as
fast
as
he
could
and
did
not
come
back
any
more
all
the
other
mermen
looked
after
him
in
silence
until
he
had
disappeared
then
one
of
them
said
in
an
voice
it
bad
for
you
sprawley
ai
it
just
think
what
you
been
doing
pooh
said
sprawley
pretending
he
was
not
frightened
what
do
i
care
i
can
fix
it
all
right
how
asked
all
the
mermen
together
well
listen
and
i
tell
you
said
sprawley
father
and
mother
bear
are
going
hunting
and
all
of
us
little
cubs
are
to
go
with
them
i
suppose
this
strange
fairy
cub
will
go
with
us
and
when
we
stop
to
rest
i
get
him
away
from
the
others
and
near
the
edge
of
the
water
you
must
come
under
the
ice
and
break
off
the
piece
he
is
standing
on
and
float
him
far
far
away
toward
the
south
until
he
melts
yes
yes
we
do
it
cried
all
the
mermen
jumping
about
and
shouting
then
they
turned
to
sprawley
come
they
cried
let
have
a
game
in
the
water
before
you
go
back
that
i
will
said
sprawley
and
with
that
what
should
he
do
but
strip
off
his
just
as
though
it
were
a
coat
and
there
he
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
merman
who
had
been
dressed
up
in
an
old
skin
pretending
to
be
a
bear
cub
sprawley
and
all
the
other
mermen
dived
off
into
the
water
and
began
splashing
and
shrieking
and
pulling
at
each
other
and
getting
farther
and
farther
away
all
the
same
i
do
think
you
float
me
off
said
teddy
to
himself
very
quietly
he
crept
to
where
the
lay
on
the
ice
and
taking
out
his
knife
he
cut
a
long
slit
up
the
back
of
it
then
not
waiting
for
the
mermen
to
come
back
he
hurried
home
again
over
the
ice
to
the
cave
and
crawling
in
he
laid
himself
down
again
between
the
sleeping
cubs
the
little
bears
were
beginning
to
stir
themselves
and
the
mother
bear
was
yawning
and
stretching
when
sprawley
came
sneaking
into
the
cave
again
why
why
said
the
mother
bear
where
have
you
been
i
ai
been
anywhere
said
sprawley
i
just
thought
i
heard
a
roaring
and
i
went
out
to
see
well
there
no
use
your
going
to
sleep
again
said
the
father
bear
for
we
have
to
go
a
long
ways
and
it
time
we
were
getting
ready
to
start
now
with
that
he
shuffled
out
of
the
cave
followed
by
the
mother
bear
and
stood
looking
about
him
presently
the
cubs
came
out
too
still
blinking
with
sleep
oh
mother
cried
dumpy
just
look
at
sprawley
back
why
what
the
matter
with
it
asked
the
mother
bear
there
ai
anything
the
matter
with
it
growled
sprawley
twisting
his
head
round
and
trying
to
see
yes
there
is
too
cried
fatty
oh
my
sprawley
splitting
hisself
all
down
the
back
why
why
cried
the
father
bear
what
this
he
shuffled
over
and
looked
at
sprawley
back
and
then
without
a
word
he
began
to
tear
and
pull
at
the
in
another
minute
he
had
it
off
and
there
stood
the
merman
shivering
and
blinking
at
them
with
his
mouth
open
like
a
gasping
fish
oh
dear
oh
dear
cried
the
mother
bear
turning
whiter
than
ever
he
not
my
cub
after
all
and
she
sat
down
and
began
to
whine
and
cry
but
father
bear
gave
a
growl
and
rising
on
his
hind
legs
he
fetched
the
merman
a
cuff
that
sent
him
tumbling
head
over
heels
across
the
ice
father
bear
was
after
him
but
before
he
could
reach
him
the
merman
was
up
and
running
for
the
open
strip
of
water
in
the
distance
father
bear
chased
him
the
whole
way
sometimes
he
caught
him
and
gave
him
a
cuff
that
sent
him
flying
but
at
last
the
merman
reached
the
water
and
dived
into
it
he
must
have
had
a
sore
head
for
days
afterward
however
when
the
father
bear
came
back
again
he
was
panting
and
growling
there
said
he
i
guess
that
the
last
time
any
of
the
mermen
will
try
to
play
their
tricks
on
us
come
come
he
went
on
it
time
we
were
off
for
our
hunting
but
the
mother
bear
only
shook
her
head
she
had
been
doing
nothing
since
she
saw
that
sprawley
was
an
but
sit
and
rock
herself
backward
and
forward
and
whine
i
could
go
my
dear
i
indeed
she
said
i
all
of
a
tremble
now
to
think
how
that
dreadful
merman
has
been
playing
with
fatty
and
dumpy
day
after
day
and
i
never
knew
it
then
i
go
by
myself
said
father
bear
gruffly
and
leave
the
children
home
with
you
but
you
can
go
fairy
he
said
to
teddy
carry
you
on
my
back
if
you
like
and
maybe
you
see
me
catch
a
young
walrus
i
suppose
it
was
you
who
split
him
down
the
back
as
the
counterpane
fairy
brought
you
yes

said
teddy
timidly
but
i
afraid

i
afraid
i
going
back
for
the
bears
the
fields
of
ice
the
green
water
were
all
wavering
and
growing
misty
before
his
sight
faintly
he
heard
the
voices
of
the
bear
cubs
owie
owie
go
away
for
they
had
grown
fond
of
him
the
day
before
then
their
voices
died
away
he
was
back
in
the
old
familiar
room
with
the
counterpane
fairy
perched
upon
his
knees
and
a
bunch
of
snowdrops
in
the
vase
beside
the
bed
the
door
opened
and
his
mother
stood
holding
the
knob
in
her
hand
and
speaking
to
hannah
outside
and
in
that
moment
the
counterpane
fairy
was
gone

of
the
doctor
promises

was
not
allowed
to

up

was
a
raw
blustering
day
and
every
feeling
of
spring
seemed
gone
from
the
air
the
wind
rattled
at
the
windows
and
hannah
built
up
the
fire
until
it
roared
teddy
did
not
feel
much
disappointed
at
not
being
allowed
to
sit
up
for

they
began

the
pictures
in
some
old
magazines

my
mother
i
do
know
whether
she
let
me
you
wo
stay
long
will
you
no
i
wo
promised
harriett
then
she
put
on
her
jacket
and
hat
and
ran
teddy
went
on
with
his
painting
by
himself
for
a
while
but
it
seemed
to
him
harriett
was
gone
a
long
time
he
called
his
mother
once
and
she
came
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
told
him
she
could
come
up
just
yet
then
teddy
began
thinking
of
the
counterpane
fairy
and
the
stories
she
had
shown
him
he
wondered
if
she
would
come
to
see
him
she
always
came
when
he
was
lonely
and
he
was
quite
sure
he
was
getting
lonely
now
yes
he
knew
he
was
well
said
a
little
voice
just
back
of
the
counterpane
hill
it
not
quite
so
steep
and
that
a
comfort
there
was
the
little
fairy
just
appearing
above
the
tops
of
his
knees
brown
hood
brown
cloak
brown
staff
and
all
she
sat
down
with
her
staff
in
her
hand
and
nodded
to
him
smiling
she
said
said
teddy
fairy
i
was
wondering
whether
you
would
like
it
if
i
kept
my
knees
down
and
then
there
would
be
any
hill
no
said
the
fairy
i
like
to
be
up
high
so
that
i
can
look
about
me
only
it
hard
climbing
sometimes
now
how
about
a
story
would
you
like
to
see
one
oh
yes
cried
teddy
indeed
i
would
then
which
square
will
you
choose
make
haste
for
i
have
much
time
i
think
i
take
that
red
one
said
teddy
very
good
said
the
fairy
and
then
she
began
to
count
as
she
counted
the
red
square
spread
and
glowed
until
it
seemed
to
teddy
that
he
was
wrapped
in
a
mist
of
ruddy
light
through
it
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
counterpane
fairy
counting
on
and
on
and
as
she
counted
he
heard
with
her
voice
another
sound
at
first
very
faintly
then
more
and
more
clearly
it
reminded
him
a
little
of
the
ticking
of
the
clock
on
the
mantle
only
it
was
more
metallic
cried
the
counterpane
fairy
clapping
her
hands
and
now
the
sound
rang
loud
and
clear
in
teddy
ears
it
was
the
beating
of
hammers
upon
anvils
when
teddy
looked
about
him
he
was
standing
on
a
road
that
ran
along
the
side
of
a
mountain
all
along
this
road
were
openings
that
looked
like
the
mouths
of
caverns
and
from
these
openings
poured
the
ceaseless
sound
of
beating
and
a
ruddy
glow
that
reddened
all
the
air
and
sky
it
all
seemed
very
familiar
to
teddy
and
he
had
a
feeling
that
he
had
seen
it
before
stepping
to
the
nearest
cavern
he
looked
in
and
there
he
saw
the
whole
inside
of
the
mountain
was
hollowed
out
into
forges
that
opened
into
each
other
be
means
of
rocky
arches
in
every
forge
were
little
dwarfs
dressed
in
leather
and
hammering
at
pieces
of
iron
that
lay
on
the
anvils
as
teddy
stood
looking
in
he
was
so
tall
that
his
head
almost
touched
the
top
of
the
doorway
he
was
dressed
in
a
long
red
cloak
and
under
that
he
wore
a
robe
fastened
about
the
waist
with
a
girdle
of
rubies
that
shone
and
sparkled
in
the
light
upon
his
hand
was
a
ruby
ring
the
stone
of
the
ring
was
turned
inward
toward
the
palm
but
it
was
so
bright
that
the
light
shone
through
his
fingers
and
he
drew
his
cloak
over
his
hand
that
the
dwarfs
might
not
see
it
for
it
was
not
yet
time
for
them
to
know
that
he
was
king
fireheart
after
a
while
the
iron
that
the
little
men
were
beating
had
to
be
put
in
the
fire
again
to
heat
and
then
they
turned
and
looked
at
teddy
said
he
answered
the
dwarfs
staring
hard
at
him
what
are
you
making
there
asked
teddy
a
link
answered
the
dwarfs
a
link
said
teddy
what
for
for
a
chain
answered
the
dwarfs
and
then
the
iron
was
hot
and
they
took
it
out
again
and
laid
it
on
the
anvil
went
their
hammers
teddy
watched
them
at
their
work
for
a
while
and
then
he
went
on
to
the
next
forge
and
there
it
was
the
same
thing
more
little
dwarfs
hammering
away
at
their
anvils
as
if
their
lives
depended
on
it
said
teddy
as
soon
as
they
paused
to
heat
the
iron
said
the
dwarfs
what
are
you
making
there
asked
teddy
a
link
answered
the
dwarfs
what
for
said
teddy
for
a
chain
answered
the
dwarfs
and
then
they
set
to
work
again
teddy
went
on
and
on
through
the
forges
and
in
every
one
of
them
were
little
dwarfs
hammering
away
on
links
when
he
came
to
the
last
forge
of
all
they
were
just
finishing
a
link
and
as
they
threw
it
into
a
tank
of
water
a
cloud
of
steam
rose
almost
hiding
them
from
view
they
were
so
busy
that
they
paid
no
attention
to
teddy
when
he
spoke
make
haste
make
haste
they
cried
to
each
other
it
is
growing
late
and
she
will
soon
be
here
in
a
great
hurry
the
dwarfs
caught
up
the
link
from
the
water
and
laid
it
on
the
anvil
again
and
then
they
all
stood
back
from
it
every
noise
has
ceased
through
all
the
forges
and
the
dwarfs
were
waiting
in
breathless
stillness
as
though
for
something
to
happen
suddenly
in
the
silence
teddy
heard
a
faint
tinkling
as
though
of
icicles
struck
lightly
together
and
at
the
same
moment
he
saw
that
a
woman
all
in
white
had
entered
the
forge
down
at
the
other
end
her
dress
shone
with
all
different
colors
just
as
icicles
do
when
they
hang
in
the
sunlight
and
as
the
light
of
the
fire
caught
it
here
and
there
it
almost
looked
as
though
it
were
on
fire
her
hair
was
very
black
and
she
wore
a
crown
she
stepped
up
to
the
anvil
that
was
in
the
forge
and
laid
her
hand
upon
it
she
was
too
far
away
for
teddy
to
see
what
she
did
but
there
was
a
clink
as
of
something
breaking
and
a
low
wail
arose
from
the
dwarfs
that
stood
near
by
then
she
passed
on
to
the
next
anvil
and
to
the
next
and
to
the
next
and
at
each
one
she
paused
and
touched
the
link
that
lay
upon
it
and
always
at
that
there
was
a
clink
and
a
wail
arose
from
the
dwarfs
at
last
she
came
to
the
very
forge
where
teddy
was
but
he
had
drawn
back
behind
the
stone
archway
and
she
did
not
see
him
gliding
to
the
anvil
she
stretched
out
her
white
finger
and
laid
it
upon
the
link
that
the
dwarfs
had
made
and
instantly
as
soon
as
she
touched
it
the
iron
flew
into
pieces
with
a
clink
the
dwarfs
burst
into
a
low
wail
but
the
woman
with
the
crown
struck
her
hands
together
and
stamped
her
foot
in
a
rage
fools
fools
she
cried
not
yet
one
link
that
will
not
fly
into
pieces
at
a
touch
but
you
shall
make
the
chain
though
it
should
take
your
very
hearts
to
do
it
then
still
scowling
until
her
beautiful
face
was
like
a
and
without
a
single
glance
at
the
trembling
dwarfs
she
glided
from
the
forge
and
was
gone
the
dwarf
who
held
the
pincers
drew
his
arm
across
his
forehead
to
wipe
off
the
sweat
come
said
he
let
us
set
to
work
for
now
it
all
to
be
done
over
again
but
tell
me
first
said
teddy
what
does
this
all
mean
and
who
is
this
woman
with
a
crown
who
comes
and
breaks
your
links
with
a
touch
as
soon
as
you
have
finished
them
ah
that
is
a
long
sad
story
said
the
dwarf
who
held
the
pincers
yes
it
is
a
long
sad
story
echoed
the
others
you
tell
him
leatherkin
they
added
well
said
leatherkin
sitting
down
on
a
rock
that
lay
close
by
it
this
way
this
mountain
where
we
live
is
only
one
of
many
that
are
called
the
fire
mountains
because
their
rocks
are
so
red
and
because
they
are
all
full
of
forges
here
we
dwarfs
used
to
live
happily
enough
for
our
good
king
fireheart
was
so
rich
and
strong
that
no
one
dared
to
make
war
on
us
and
we
were
left
in
peace
to
do
what
we
would
king
fireheart
however
was
not
contented
for
he
wanted
to
see
the
world
so
one
day
he
set
out
on
a
journey
no
one
knew
whither
leaving
the
country
in
the
charge
of
his
while
he
was
away
the
came
with
all
her
white
spearsmen
and
attacked
the
country
and
conquered
it
then
she
set
us
all
to
work
for
she
knew
that
in
all
the
world
there
were
no
such
smiths
as
the
dwarfs
of
the
fire
king
country
and
not
until
we
have
forged
her
the
magic
chain
that
binds
all
but
one
self
will
she
set
us
free
to
go
about
out
own
affairs
again
that
is
why
we
are
all
working
to
forge
the
links
and
if
we
could
but
make
one
that
would
stand
so
much
as
a
touch
of
her
finger
we
would
have
hopes
of
making
it
but
so
far
not
one
has
been
made
but
what
flies
into
pieces
at
her
lightest
touch
but
there
he
added
we
must
set
to
work
for
the
days
are
all
too
short
for
what
we
have
to
do
wait
a
bit
said
teddy
i
should
like
to
have
a
stroke
at
that
chain
myself
will
you
lend
me
a
hammer
and
let
me
try
no
no
cried
the
dwarfs
shaking
their
heads
we
have
no
time
to
waste
in
lending
out
hammers
and
anvil
look
said
teddy
taking
off
his
ruby
girdle
and
holding
it
out
to
them
you
shall
have
this
if
you
will
let
me
try
the
dwarfs
eyes
glittered
and
they
took
the
girdle
and
all
crowded
around
to
look
and
handle
it
for
they
had
never
seen
such
fine
rubies
before
not
even
down
in
the
middle
of
the
earth
and
at
last
they
told
teddy
that
they
would
lend
him
their
hammers
awhile
in
exchange
for
the
ruby
girdle
though
what
can
you
do
with
them
they
said
for
look
at
your
hands
they
are
white
and
smooth
and
not
hairy
and
strong
like
ours
never
you
mind
said
teddy
for
sometimes
white
smooth
hands
can
do
the
work
that
others
ca
and
he
took
one
of
their
hammers
in
his
hand
as
he
spoke
what
will
you
have
to
work
with
they
asked
oh
anything
at
all
said
teddy
if
it
is
no
more
than
an
old
nail
so
that
it
is
something
to
begin
with
the
dwarfs
laughed
and
picking
up
an
old
nail
that
was
on
the
floor
they
laid
it
upon
the
anvil
then
teddy
raised
the
hammer
and
the
ruby
of
the
ring
he
wore
throbbed
and
burned
until
his
hand
was
hot
and
his
arm
was
so
strong
that
the
hammer
was
like
a
feather
in
his
grasp
as
he
beat
and
turned
the
nail
he
sang
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
fire
sang
with
him
clear
and
thin
and
sounding
like
the
voice
of
the
counterpane
fairy
hammer
and
turn
the
fire
must
burn
the
coals
must
glow
the
bellows
blow
beat
good
hammer
loud
and
fast
so
the
chain
will
be
made
at
last
we
forge
the
link
my
hammer
bold
this
chain
must
hold
the
snow
shall
melt
the
ice
fly
fast
for
the
magic
chain
is
wrought
at
last
with
these
words
teddy
threw
down
the
hammer
and
lifted
the
chain
he
had
made
and
it
was
as
thin
as
a
hair
as
light
as
a
breath
and
yet
so
strong
that
no
power
on
earth
could
break
it
the
dwarfs
sprang
forward
with
a
shout
and
caught
the
chain
in
their
crooked
fingers
wonderful
wonderful
they
cried
it
is
indeed
the
magic
chain
that
we
have
been
trying
to
make
for
all
these
years
who
are
you
wonderful
stranger
for
there
is
no
smith
among
all
the
dwarfs
who
can
do
what
you
have
done
then
without
a
word
teddy
raised
his
hand
and
held
it
up
with
the
palm
turned
toward
them
so
that
they
saw
the
ruby
in
his
ring
and
when
they
saw
it
they
shouted
again
in
their
wonder
and
joy
it
is
king
fireheart
himself
come
back
to
rule
the
country
then
all
the
dwarfs
even
from
the
farthest
forges
came
running
up
and
gathered
about
the
archway
of
the
forge
where
teddy
stood
and
when
they
saw
that
it
was
indeed
king
fireheart
they
shouted
and
leaped
and
threw
their
caps
up
into
the
air
when
they
had
grown
quieter
teddy
bade
them
take
him
to
the
so
all
the
dwarfs
led
him
out
and
up
the
mountain
on
and
on
until
they
came
to
a
great
castle
built
of
ice
but
ruddy
with
the
cold
light
of
the
aurora
borealis
that
shone
behind
it
they
went
into
the
hall
past
the
rows
of
white
spearsmen
and
when
the
spearsmen
would
have
stopped
them
the
dwarfs
told
them
that
they
were
carrying
the
magic
chain
that
binds
all
but
one
self
to
the
queen
and
so
they
let
the
little
men
pass
on
but
all
the
while
teddy
kept
the
ruby
ring
hidden
under
his
cloak
at
last
they
came
to
the
great
chamber
where
the
queen
sat
on
a
magnificent
throne
of
ice
and
when
she
saw
the
crowd
she
started
to
her
feet
have
you
brought
it
have
you
brought
it
she
cried
eagerly
have
you
brought
me
the
magic
chain
yes
shouted
the
dwarfs
all
together
we
have
brought
it
then
they
stood
still
and
teddy
went
on
up
the
steps
along
where
is
it
asked
the
queen
and
she
stretched
out
her
hands
it
is
here
said
teddy
very
slowly
he
drew
it
out
from
under
his
cloak
and
then
suddenly
he
threw
it
over
her
and
now
take
it
he
cried
it
was
in
vain
that
the
queen
struggled
and
cried
the
more
she
strove
the
closer
the
chain
drew
about
her
for
it
was
a
magic
chain
at
last
she
stood
still
panting
who
are
you
she
asked
then
teddy
raised
his
hand
holding
it
open
so
that
she
could
see
the
ruby
i
am
king
fireheart
he
cried
and
now
take
your
own
real
shape
wicked
enchantress
that
you
are
at
these
words
the
queen
gave
a
cry
that
changed
even
as
she
uttered
it
to
a
croak
and
a
moment
after
she
was
nothing
but
a
great
black
raven
that
spread
its
wings
and
flew
away
over
the
heads
of
the
dwarfs
out
of
the
window
and
on
out
of
sight
then
teddy
turned
and
walked
out
of
the
great
and
down
the
hall
followed
in
silence
by
the
dwarfs
as
he
went
the
spearsmen
started
forward
to
lay
hands
upon
him
but
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
ruby
ring
they
stood
every
man
stiffened
just
as
he
was
some
leaning
forward
with
outstretched
arm
some
with
their
spears
lifted
some
with
their
mouths
open
but
all
of
them
turned
to
ice
when
teddy
and
the
dwarfs
had
reached
the
mountain
road
again
they
turned
and
looked
back
toward
the
castle
a
warm
south
wind
was
blowing
and
the
aurora
borealis
had
faded
away
already
the
castle
was
beginning
to
melt
the
spires
and
turrets
were
softening
and
dripping
down
there
was
a
warm
red
light
over
everything
like
the
light
of
the
rising
sun
and
now
cried
the
dwarfs
will
your
majesty
come
up
to
your
own
royal
castle
yes
answered
teddy
i
will
come
quick
quick
cried
the
counterpane
fairy
it
time
to
come
back
teddy
was
at
home
once
more
there
was
the
flowered
furniture
and
the
fire
burning
red
upon
the
hearth
said
the
clock
i
must
go
cried
the
fairy
hastily
for
i
heard
your
little
cousin
opening
and
shutting
the
side
door
oh
wait
cried
teddy
wo
you
wait
and
let
her
see
you
too
but
the
fairy
was
already
disappearing
behind
the
counterpane
hill
all
he
could
see
was
the
top
of
her
pointed
hood
then
that
too
disappeared
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
harriett
came
running
in
bringing
a
breath
of
fresh
air
with
her
her
cheeks
were
red
and
she
looked
very
pretty
in
her
embroidered
apron
and
pink
ribbons
chapter
seventh
the
rainbow
children
it
was
sunday
afternoon
and
everything
was
very
still
teddy
had
been
allowed
to
sit
up
that
morning
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
been
ill
he
had
put
on
the
little
blue
that
mamma
had
made
for
him
and
she
was
so
funny
about
getting
him
into
it
and
wheeling
the
chair
over
to
the
window
that
teddy
had
laughed
and
laughed
after
that
he
sat
at
the
window
looking
out
and
watching
the
chickens
in
the
yard
below
and
the
people
going
along
the
street
teddy
mamma
was
going
to
church
but
his
father
stayed
home
with
the
little
boy
and
told
him
stories
and
drew
pictures
with
a
blue
pencil
on
a
pictures
of
david
killing
goliath
and
of
daniel
in
the
lions
den
then
he
drew
a
picture
of
the
house
in
the
real
country
where
he
and
mamma
and
teddy
were
going
to
live
some
time
a
house
with
a
barn
and
horses
and
cows
and
pigs
and
a
pony
that
teddy
could
ride
when
he
came
in
to
town
to
school
the
morning
flew
by
so
quickly
that
the
little
boy
was
surprised
when
mamma
came
back
from
church
and
said
it
was
almost
time
for
luncheon
she
looked
at
the
pictures
that
papa
had
drawn
and
smiled
when
teddy
told
her
about
them
but
very
soon
she
began
to
talk
seriously
with
papa
she
told
him
she
had
stopped
in
at
mcfinney
on
her
way
home
and
that
she
had
been
wondering
whether
something
could
be
done
for
little
ellen
mcfinney
lameness
she
felt
so
sorry
for
her
papa
said
the
child
ought
to
be
sent
to
a
hospital
and
he
thought
that
if
that
were
done
she
could
be
cured
mamma
said
that
she
thought
so
too
but
that
someone
had
been
talking
to
little
ellen
and
frightened
her
so
that
she
cried
whenever
the
hospital
was
talked
of
and
her
mother
would
not
send
her
unless
she
felt
willing
to
go
then
mamma
spoke
of
how
lonely
it
must
be
for
the
little
girl
there
in
the
house
by
herself
all
the
day
while
her
mother
was
out
at
work
with
so
little
to
amuse
her
mamma
said
teddy
why
ca
little
ellen
have
some
of
my
books
to
amuse
her
some
i
had
when
i
was
sick
because
you
know
i
well
now
and
do
need
them
any
more
that
a
very
good
idea
said
mamma
looking
pleased
you
may
choose
the
ones
you
will
give
her
and
perhaps
papa
will
leave
them
with
her
when
he
goes
out
for
a
walk
this
afternoon
well
cried
teddy
eagerly
i
think
i
give
her
the
ali
baba
book
and
robinson
crusoe
and
i
think
maybe
i
give
her
little
golden
locks
too
mamma
brought
the
books
and
they
tied
them
up
in
a
neat
package
and
just
as
they
finished
there
was
a
little
rattle
of
china
outside
the
door
and
in
came
hannah
with
teddy
luncheon
and
a
great
yellow
orange
that
aunt
pauline
had
sent
him
after
luncheon
mamma
made
teddy
lie
down
for
a
while
to
rest
the
venetian
shutters
were
drawn
so
that
all
the
room
was
dimly
green
and
then
mamma
and
papa
went
out
and
left
him
alone
teddy
lay
there
for
what
seemed
to
him
a
long
time
the
house
was
very
still
and
the
afternoon
sun
shone
in
through
the
slats
of
the
shutters
in
golden
chinks
and
lines
teddy
wondered
where
mamma
was
and
why
she
did
come
back
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
alone
almost
all
the
afternoon
though
really
it
had
not
been
for
long
presently
he
heard
someone
humming
cheerfully
back
of
the
counterpane
hill
and
as
soon
as
he
heard
it
he
felt
sure
that
the
counterpane
fairy
must
be
coming
sure
enough
in
a
few
minutes
she
appeared
at
the
top
and
stood
looking
down
at
him
with
a
pleasant
smile
oh
fairy
i
knew
that
was
you
cried
teddy
did
you
said
the
fairy
sitting
down
on
top
of
his
knees
and
then
did
you
think
i
shall
see
another
story
oh
yes
cried
teddy
eagerly
i
hoped
you
would
show
me
one
then
i
suppose
i
have
to
said
the
fairy
and
what
square
shall
it
be
this
time
there
one
close
by
you
said
teddy
and
it
most
every
color
like
a
rainbow
will
you
show
me
that
story
yes
said
the
fairy
i
show
you
that
now
fix
your
eyes
on
it
then
she
began
to
count
she
cried
teddy
and
little
ellen
mcfinney
were
running
along
hand
in
hand
over
a
rainbow
that
stretched
across
the
shining
sky
like
a
bridge
the
clouds
above
them
shone
like
opals
and
far
far
below
was
the
green
world
with
shining
rivers
and
houses
that
looked
no
larger
than
walnuts
ca
we
run
fast
said
teddy
i
think
we
go
as
fast
as
an
express
train
do
you
ellen
i
know
a
faster
way
to
go
than
this
said
the
little
girl
do
you
yes
i
do
let
go
of
my
hand
and
i
show
you
she
drew
her
hand
away
from
teddy
and
very
slowly
she
leaned
back
against
the
air
as
though
it
were
a
pillow
then
she
gave
herself
a
little
push
with
her
feet
and
away
she
floated
so
lightly
and
easily
that
teddy
could
hardly
keep
up
with
her
oh
ellen
cried
teddy
will
you
teach
me
to
do
that
yes
i
will
said
ellen
so
she
stood
up
and
showed
teddy
how
to
take
a
long
breath
and
how
to
push
himself
and
then
he
found
he
could
do
it
quite
well
and
when
ellen
began
to
float
too
they
could
go
along
together
hand
in
hand
just
as
they
had
before
suddenly
a
thought
crossed
teddy
mind
and
he
cried
why
ellen
i
thought
you
were
lame
so
i
am
said
the
little
girl
but
you
can
run
and
float
yes
i
know
but
that
because
i
dreaming
why
no
ellen
you
ca
be
dreaming
said
teddy
for
i
here
too
well
i
do
know
said
ellen
but
i
think
i
dreaming
because
i
often
dreamed
this
way
before
teddy
thought
of
this
for
a
little
while
but
it
was
not
pleasant
to
think
that
he
was
in
a
dream
after
a
while
he
said
ellen
do
you
know
if
you
lame
you
ought
to
go
to
a
hospital
my
mamma
says
so
and
my
papa
says
so
too
an
ugly
expression
came
into
ellen
face
that
all
you
know
about
it
she
cried
you
do
catch
me
going
to
a
hospital
why
i
heard
of
a
girl
that
went
to
a
hospital
and
she
was
interrupted
by
a
soft
burst
of
laughter
and
looking
about
teddy
saw
that
he
and
she
had
floated
right
into
midst
of
a
group
of
little
children
who
were
running
along
the
rainbow
bridge
they
were
all
such
pretty
little
children
with
soft
shining
faces
and
bare
feet
but
they
did
not
quite
look
like
any
children
that
teddy
had
ever
seen
before
each
little
child
carried
in
its
hand
a
bunch
of
flowers
and
they
were
such
flowers
as
the
little
boy
had
never
dreamed
of
some
of
them
moved
on
their
stalks
opening
and
closing
their
petals
softly
like
the
wings
of
butterflies
some
shone
like
jewels
and
some
seemed
to
change
and
throb
as
if
with
a
hidden
pulse
of
life
ellen
who
had
stopped
floating
caught
teddy
by
the
coat
and
hung
back
timidly
when
she
saw
the
children
but
teddy
spoke
to
the
one
nearest
to
him
where
did
you
get
your
flowers
he
asked
from
the
garden
at
the
other
end
of
the
rainbow
said
the
little
child
smiling
at
him
give
me
one
oh
no
i
ca
answered
the
child
staring
at
him
with
big
eyes
they
for
someone
else
whom
are
they
for
you
can
come
along
and
see
oh
say
whispered
ellen
to
teddy
let
go
back
but
teddy
answered
no
no
come
on
and
see
where
they
going
so
ellen
reluctantly
followed
him
and
they
joined
the
other
little
children
journeying
along
the
rainbow
the
strange
little
children
seemed
very
happy
and
they
laughed
and
talked
together
in
their
soft
clear
voices
though
teddy
could
not
always
understand
what
they
said
he
could
understand
best
the
little
boy
to
whom
he
had
spoken
first
teddy
asked
him
again
where
they
were
going
and
this
time
the
little
boy
he
seemed
to
be
the
captain
of
the
band
told
him
that
they
were
going
down
to
the
earth
he
said
that
every
week
they
had
a
holiday
and
then
they
crossed
the
rainbow
bridge
and
carried
the
flowers
from
their
down
to
the
little
earth
children
but
what
little
children
asked
teddy
curiously
oh
you
see
answered
the
little
boy
laughing
and
then
he
began
to
talk
with
the
others
and
teddy
could
no
longer
understand
him
it
was
not
long
after
this
that
teddy
saw
before
him
the
end
of
the
rainbow
and
where
should
it
go
but
right
through
the
window
of
a
great
square
yellow
house
set
back
of
a
high
wall
and
in
the
middle
of
a
lawn
oh
dear
we
ca
get
to
the
end
of
it
after
all
cried
teddy
and
the
next
thing
he
knew
the
little
children
were
walking
through
the
window
just
as
if
nothing
were
there
and
he
and
ellen
were
following
them
where
are
we
asked
ellen
looking
about
her
half
frightened
and
yet
curious
i
ca
think
said
teddy
seems
as
if
i
knew
but
i
ca
think
they
were
in
a
long
bare
clean
room
and
on
each
side
of
it
were
rows
of
little
white
beds
and
in
each
bed
lay
or
sat
a
little
child
a
few
of
the
children
were
asleep
most
of
them
were
awake
but
all
looked
pale
and
thin
here
and
there
at
the
sides
of
the
beds
people
were
sitting
sometimes
showing
the
children
pictures
or
books
and
sometimes
reading
to
them
the
children
from
the
rainbow
walked
slowly
up
the
aisle
between
the
row
of
beds
and
strangely
enough
no
one
seemed
to
look
at
them
or
pay
the
least
attention
any
more
than
if
they
had
not
been
there
and
at
last
teddy
began
to
believe
that
they
could
not
see
them
often
the
little
strange
children
stopped
to
smooth
a
pillow
or
to
softly
stroke
the
cheek
or
hand
of
one
of
the
little
earth
children
here
and
there
one
would
linger
behind
the
others
by
some
bed
and
after
a
moment
would
lay
its
bunch
of
flowers
on
the
pillow
then
the
little
child
in
the
bed
would
turn
its
head
and
smile
even
if
it
were
asleep
and
its
face
would
shine
as
if
with
some
inward
happiness
the
whole
room
seemed
filled
with
the
perfume
of
flowers
and
teddy
wondered
that
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
it
at
last
they
came
to
a
bed
where
a
little
child
was
lying
fast
asleep
and
a
woman
was
sitting
beside
the
child
and
fanning
it
suddenly
its
eyes
opened
and
the
moment
they
turned
toward
the
rainbow
children
teddy
knew
that
it
saw
them
it
lay
looking
for
a
moment
and
then
it
smiled
and
feebly
tried
to
wave
its
hand
what
is
it
dear
asked
the
woman
bending
over
the
child
but
it
paid
no
attention
to
her
for
it
was
gazing
at
the
rainbow
children
oh
he
sees
us
he
sees
us
they
cried
clapping
their
hands
joyfully
he
be
coming
across
the
rainbow
soon
then
the
rainbow
children
gathered
about
the
bed
and
began
talking
to
the
child
but
teddy
could
not
understand
what
they
said
to
it
the
little
child
on
the
bed
seemed
to
understand
them
though
and
it
smiled
and
tried
to
nod
its
head
come
soon
come
soon
cried
the
little
children
waving
their
hands
to
it
as
they
moved
away
and
the
eyes
of
the
child
on
the
bed
followed
them
wistfully
as
though
it
were
eager
to
follow
teddy
and
ellen
still
went
with
the
other
little
children
and
a
moment
after
they
were
out
on
the
rainbow
bridge
again
high
up
above
the
world
but
they
were
alone
for
the
little
strange
children
were
gone
ellen
stood
still
and
drew
a
long
breath
oh
was
that
lovely
she
sighed
i
wonder
where
it
was
i
know
where
it
was
cried
teddy
suddenly
i
remember
now
for
i
saw
a
picture
of
it
in
one
of
papa
magazines
that
was
a
hospital
ellen
a
hospital
cried
the
little
girl
yes
a
hospital
ellen
did
not
say
anything
for
some
time
but
at
last
she
drew
another
deep
breath
well
if
that
a
hospital
i
should
mind
going
to
a
place
like
that
she
said
the
rainbow
had
faded
away
and
teddy
was
back
in
the
great
bedstead
again
with
the
silk
coverlet
drawn
up
over
his
knees
and
the
counterpane
fairy
still
sitting
on
top
of
the
hill
teddy
lay
looking
at
her
for
a
while
in
silence
fairy
was
that
a
true
story
like
the
others
he
asked
her
at
last
how
should
i
know
asked
the
fairy
do
i
look
as
though
i
knew
anything
about
rainbow
children
you
better
ask
ellen
mcfinney
maybe
she
can
tell
you
well
i
will
said
teddy
i
mean
to
ask
her
just
as
soon
as
ever
well
he
did
not
have
to
wait
for
that
however
for
the
very
next
day
his
mother
told
him
that
little
ellen
had
at
last
consented
to
be
taken
to
the
hospital
and
that
perhaps
when
he
saw
the
little
girl
again
she
would
be
able
to
walk
and
run
about
almost
like
other
children
chapter
eighth
harriett
dream
teddy
had
begged
mamma
to
ask
harriett
to
come
over
and
play
with
him
after
school
but
not
to
tell
her
that
now
he
was
no
longer
in
bed
so
when
the
little
girl
came
running
in
she
was
very
much
surprised
why
teddy
you
well
again
are
you
she
cried
yes
now
i
well
again
said
teddy
and
mamma
says
we
may
each
have
a
little
and
she
going
to
let
us
blow
would
you
like
to
blow
harriett
yes
i
guess
so
said
harriett
so
mamma
made
them
a
bowl
of
strong
suds
and
brought
out
two
pipes
and
the
children
played
together
very
happily
for
quite
a
time
sometimes
they
threw
the
bubbles
into
the
air
and
tried
to
blow
them
up
to
the
ceiling
sometimes
the
children
put
their
pipes
close
together
so
that
the
bubbles
they
blew
were
joined
in
one
lopsided
globe
last
of
all
they
set
the
bowl
on
a
chair
and
kneeling
beside
it
put
their
pipes
into
the
suds
and
blew
and
blew
until
quite
a
castle
rose
up
and
touched
their
noses
with
wet
suds
teddy
felt
a
little
tired
and
soapy
by
that
time
so
mamma
put
all
the
things
away
and
read
them
some
stories
from
grimm
fairy
tales
after
that
harriett
said
she
must
go
home
and
indeed
it
was
almost
so
mamma
helped
her
put
on
her
little
hat
and
coat
and
kissed
her
teddy
was
very
tired
by
the
time
supper
was
over
he
felt
quite
willing
to
be
put
to
bed
and
as
soon
as
he
was
there
he
sank
into
a
doze
when
he
awoke
again
he
was
alone
it
was
quite
dark
outside
but
mamma
had
set
a
lamp
behind
the
screen
by
its
dim
light
teddy
saw
the
counterpane
fairy
brown
hood
appearing
above
the
hill
and
he
heard
her
sighing
to
herself
oh
dear
oh
dear
oh
mrs
fairy
cried
the
little
boy
almost
before
she
had
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
i
so
glad
you
come
for
i
do
know
when
mamma
will
be
here
wo
you
show
me
a
story
in
a
minute
in
a
minute
said
the
fairy
as
soon
as
i
can
catch
my
breath
teddy
was
so
afraid
that
mamma
would
come
in
that
he
could
hardly
wait
and
when
the
counterpane
fairy
told
him
that
she
was
ready
and
that
he
might
choose
a
square
he
made
haste
and
pointed
out
a
silvery
gray
one
then
the
fairy
began
to
count
she
cried
teddy
was
walking
down
a
long
smooth
gray
road
there
was
a
silvery
mist
all
about
him
so
that
it
was
almost
as
though
he
were
walking
through
the
sky
and
the
road
seemed
to
begin
and
end
in
grayness
he
knew
that
somewhere
behind
him
lay
his
home
and
that
in
front
was
the
place
where
he
was
going
but
he
did
not
know
what
that
place
was
at
last
he
reached
the
edge
of
a
wide
gray
lake
as
smooth
and
as
shining
as
glass
beside
him
on
the
beach
a
little
gray
bird
was
crouching
cried
the
little
gray
bird
it
was
so
close
to
teddy
feet
that
it
seemed
to
him
that
with
a
single
movement
he
could
stoop
and
catch
it
very
softly
he
reached
out
his
hand
and
the
little
bird
did
not
stir
it
cried
suddenly
with
a
quick
movement
he
clutched
it
for
a
moment
he
thought
that
he
felt
it
in
his
fingers
all
feathery
and
soft
and
warm
and
then
the
voice
of
the
counterpane
fairy
cried
take
care
you
rumpling
my
cloak
teddy
dropped
the
bird
as
though
it
had
burned
him
and
there
it
was
not
a
bird
at
all
but
the
counterpane
fairy
who
stood
smoothing
down
her
cloak
and
frowning
oh
i
did
know
that
was
you
i
thought
it
was
a
bird
cried
teddy
a
bird
cried
the
fairy
do
i
look
like
a
bird
teddy
thought
that
she
did
for
her
nose
was
long
and
thin
and
her
eyes
were
bright
like
those
of
a
sparrow
but
he
did
not
like
to
say
so
all
he
said
was
i
wonder
why
i
came
here
for
now
he
knew
that
this
was
the
place
that
he
had
been
coming
to
i
suppose
you
came
to
see
the
dreams
go
by
said
the
counterpane
fairy
i
often
come
for
that
myself
the
dreams
go
by
said
teddy
i
do
know
what
you
mean
do
you
see
that
castle
over
yonder
asked
the
fairy
pointing
out
across
the
lake
teddy
looked
as
hard
as
he
could
and
after
a
while
he
thought
he
did
see
the
shadowy
roofs
and
turrets
of
a
great
gray
castle
through
the
mist
i
think
i
do
he
said
well
said
the
fairy
that
is
where
the
dreams
live
and
every
evening
they
go
sailing
past
here
on
their
way
to
the
people
who
are
asleep
and
i
generally
come
down
to
see
them
go
by
look
look
there
goes
one
now
a
little
boat
as
pale
and
light
as
a
bubble
was
gliding
through
the
mist
in
it
was
seated
a
gray
figure
and
as
it
passed
the
island
it
turned
its
face
toward
them
and
waved
a
shadowy
hand
presently
two
more
boats
slid
silently
by
and
then
another
oh
i
know
that
dream
cried
teddy
i
dreamed
that
dream
once
myself
now
there
was
a
little
pause
and
then
the
dreams
began
to
go
past
so
fast
that
teddy
lost
count
of
them
at
last
one
of
the
boats
gilded
out
of
the
line
of
the
rest
and
over
toward
where
teddy
was
standing
running
up
smoothly
onto
the
gray
beach
and
out
of
it
hopped
a
queer
ugly
little
dream
with
pop
eyes
and
big
hands
and
feet
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
on
shore
he
cut
a
caper
and
cracked
his
shadowy
fingers
who
are
you
asked
teddy
curiously
oh
i
just
a
dream
said
the
little
figure
well
what
are
you
coming
here
for
asked
teddy
i
not
asleep
i
know
you
not
said
the
dream
and
i
not
coming
to
you
going
to
a
little
girl
named
harriett
oh
i
know
her
cried
teddy
she
my
cousin
but
why
are
you
her
dream
you
not
pretty
i
know
i
not
pretty
answered
the
dream
and
that
why
i
going
to
her
she
was
to
have
had
such
a
pretty
dream
but
she
ate
a
piece
of
before
she
went
to
bed
so
now
i
going
to
her
instead
of
the
other
one
what
was
the
other
one
like
asked
teddy
there
it
is
said
the
dream
pointing
toward
the
boat
and
now
teddy
saw
that
another
gray
figure
was
in
it
as
he
looked
it
slowly
and
sorrowfully
stepped
from
the
boat
and
came
up
the
beach
toward
them
it
was
very
beautiful
and
in
its
hand
it
carried
a
great
bunch
of
shining
bubbles
fastened
to
a
stick
by
ribbons
just
as
teddy
had
seen
italians
carrying
balloons
only
these
were
growing
and
shrinking
and
changing
every
moment
just
as
though
they
were
alive
as
she
came
toward
them
the
ugly
dream
frowned
and
shook
his
hands
at
her
go
away
go
away
he
cried
there
no
use
your
following
me
around
this
way
you
be
dreamed
i
think
you
might
let
me
go
into
her
dream
with
you
said
the
pretty
dream
sorrowfully
she
did
know
she
ought
to
eat
the
well
you
said
the
ugly
dream
she
ai
going
to
have
any
dream
but
me
and
i
going
to
look
just
as
ugly
as
i
can
i
going
to
do
this
way
and
the
naughty
little
dream
put
his
thumbs
in
the
corners
of
his
mouth
drawing
it
wide
and
at
the
same
time
drew
down
the
outside
corners
of
his
eyes
with
his
forefingers
just
as
teddy
had
seen
the
boys
at
school
do
sometimes
then
the
dream
hopped
up
into
the
air
and
cut
a
caper
ho
ho
he
cried
wo
it
be
fun
you
can
come
along
and
see
me
frighten
her
if
you
want
to
this
last
he
said
to
teddy
teddy
thought
him
a
very
naughty
little
dream
but
still
he
went
with
him
wondering
all
the
time
how
he
could
induce
him
to
let
the
pretty
dream
go
to
harriett
and
as
they
walked
up
the
road
together
the
pretty
dream
still
followed
them
carrying
her
bunch
of
bubbles
they
went
on
and
on
until
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
ground
was
rough
and
broken
up
with
a
number
of
black
holes
the
ugly
dream
went
from
one
to
another
of
these
pausing
and
laying
his
ear
to
their
edges
what
are
you
doing
asked
teddy
hush
ca
you
see
i
listening
said
the
dream
crossly
at
last
after
pausing
at
one
of
them
he
turned
to
teddy
and
nodded
his
head
this
is
it
he
said
this
is
where
harriett
lives
why
it
is
at
all
cried
teddy
indignantly
my
cousin
harriett
does
live
in
a
hole
she
lives
in
a
great
big
house
with
doors
and
windows
well
anyway
this
is
her
chimney
said
the
dream
and
it
the
only
way
to
get
into
her
house
from
here
if
you
want
to
come
come
and
if
you
do
want
to
why
stay
and
the
dream
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
hole
teddy
hesitated
if
i
went
down
that
way
i
think
i
fall
and
hurt
myself
he
said
at
last
pooh
no
you
would
if
you
took
my
hand
said
the
dream
i
always
go
this
way
and
it
as
easy
as
anything
so
teddy
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
hole
and
grasped
the
shadowy
fingers
in
his
then
they
pushed
themselves
off
the
edge
and
down
they
went
through
the
darkness
teddy
felt
so
frightened
for
a
minute
that
he
quite
lost
his
breath
but
he
held
on
tight
to
the
dream
fingers
and
soon
they
landed
as
softly
and
lightly
as
a
feather
right
in
the
nursery
of
aunt
paulina
house
and
the
pretty
dream
was
still
following
them
and
now
begins
the
fun
whispered
the
dream
the
house
was
very
still
for
everyone
was
fast
asleep
the
moon
shone
in
through
the
window
making
the
room
bright
and
beyond
the
open
closet
door
teddy
could
see
the
toys
all
arranged
in
order
just
as
harriett
had
left
them
for
she
was
a
tidy
little
girl
and
harriett
herself
was
tucked
into
her
little
white
bed
in
the
room
beyond
teddy
felt
so
sorry
to
think
of
her
having
such
an
ugly
dream
that
he
stood
still
you
wo
frighten
her
very
much
will
you
he
asked
yes
i
shall
said
the
ugly
dream
i
frighten
her
just
as
much
as
ever
i
can
i
make
her
cry
no
you
must
said
teddy
almost
crying
himself
i
wo
let
you
you
ca
help
it
cried
the
dream
tauntingly
suddenly
a
bright
thought
came
into
teddy
mind
anyway
you
not
so
very
ugly
he
said
harriet
has
a
that
a
great
deal
oh
ever
so
much
uglier
than
you
i
do
believe
it
said
the
dream
yes
she
has
said
teddy
and
it
right
there
in
the
closet
then
i
get
it
and
make
myself
look
like
it
with
that
the
dream
crawled
into
the
closet
and
pushed
back
the
hook
of
the
box
where
jack
lived
and
pop
up
shot
the
most
hideous
little
man
that
ever
was
seen
with
a
bright
red
face
and
white
whiskers
hi
he
is
ugly
cried
the
dream
with
delight
and
sitting
down
before
the
box
he
began
to
make
his
face
like
the
jack
then
softly
and
quickly
teddy
closed
the
closet
door
and
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
fastening
the
dream
in
hi
there
let
me
out
let
me
out
cried
the
dream
beating
softly
on
the
door
with
its
shadowy
hands
no
i
wo
cried
teddy
you
can
just
stay
in
there
you
ugly
dream
for
the
pretty
dream
is
going
to
harriett
now
then
he
turned
to
the
pretty
dream
and
took
her
by
the
hand
and
her
face
shone
as
brightly
as
one
of
her
own
bubbles
together
they
ran
into
harriett
room
and
there
she
lay
in
her
little
white
bed
with
her
eyes
closed
and
her
curls
spread
out
over
the
pillow
and
when
they
came
in
she
smiled
in
her
sleep
the
dream
shook
the
bubbles
above
the
bed
and
the
dimples
came
into
harriett
cheeks
oh
pretty
pretty
she
whispered
with
her
eyes
still
closed
oh
teddy
is
it
pretty
yes
it
is
pretty
cried
teddy
did
you
call
me
dear
asked
mamma
opening
the
door
teddy
was
back
in
his
own
room
and
all
he
could
see
of
the
counterpane
fairy
was
the
tip
of
her
brown
hood
disappearing
behind
the
counterpane
hill
and
that
was
gone
in
an
instant
oh
mamma
it
was
such
a
pretty
dream
cried
teddy
was
it
darling
said
mamma
try
to
go
to
sleep
again
dear
for
it
is
very
late
and
you
can
tell
me
all
about
it
my
little
boy
chapter
ninth
down
the
the
next
day
teddy
was
allowed
to
go
about
and
follow
mamma
into
the
where
he
had
the
little
drawn
out
and
his
toys
put
on
it
and
played
for
a
long
time
in
the
afternoon
harriett
stopped
for
a
little
while
and
as
soon
as
teddy
saw
her
his
thoughts
went
back
to
the
counterpane
fairy
and
the
story
and
he
cried
out
oh
harriett
i
know
what
you
dreamed
last
night
what
did
i
dream
asked
harriett
why
you
dreamed
about
the
and
me
did
you
how
did
you
know
i
dreamed
that
asked
harriett
then
teddy
told
her
all
about
standing
by
the
lake
and
seeing
the
dreams
go
past
and
how
he
had
shut
the
ugly
one
up
in
the
harriett
listened
with
great
interest
was
that
a
funny
dream
she
cried
when
he
had
ended
a
dream
said
teddy
why
that
was
a
dream
harriett
that
the
story
the
counterpane
fairy
showed
me
and
do
you
know
you
did
dream
about
the
bubbles
harriet
was
silent
awhile
as
if
pondering
it
and
then
she
said
my
flew
away
this
morning
who
let
it
out
asked
teddy
with
interest
did
you
harriett
hesitated
well
i
did
exactly
let
it
out
she
said
i
guess
i
forgot
to
close
the
door
after
i
cleaned
its
cage
then
she
added
hastily
but
mamma
hung
the
cage
outside
the
window
and
she
says
she
thinks
maybe
it
come
back
unless
someone
has
caught
it
teddy
wanted
to
hear
a
great
deal
more
about
the
canary
but
harriett
said
she
must
go
now
so
he
was
left
alone
again
to
play
with
his
toys
after
dinner
his
mother
went
to
buy
a
present
for
harriett
for
the
next
day
was
to
be
the
little
girl
birthday
teddy
wanted
to
get
her
a
bag
of
marbles
but
she
thought
perhaps
she
would
be
able
to
find
something
harriett
would
like
better
than
that
she
would
look
about
and
see
before
she
went
she
made
teddy
lie
down
on
the
bed
and
covered
him
over
with
the
silk
quilt
so
that
he
might
rest
for
a
while
then
she
kissed
him
and
told
him
to
try
to
take
a
nap
and
promised
to
be
back
soon
after
she
had
gone
teddy
dozed
comfortably
for
a
while
then
he
grew
wide
awake
again
and
turning
over
on
his
back
he
raised
his
knees
into
a
hill
and
lay
looking
out
of
the
window
and
wondering
when
mamma
would
come
home
and
what
she
would
bring
with
her
you
not
asleep
are
you
asked
a
little
voice
from
his
knees
oh
counterpane
fairy
i
so
glad
you
come
cried
teddy
for
mamma
has
gone
and
i
was
just
beginning
to
get
lonely
there
was
the
familiar
little
figure
in
the
brown
cloak
and
hood
seated
on
top
of
the
counterpane
hill
and
as
he
spoke
she
looked
down
on
him
smilingly
i
suppose
the
next
thing
will
be
a
story
she
said
oh
will
you
show
me
one
cried
teddy
i
wish
you
would
for
i
know
when
mamma
will
be
home
very
well
said
the
fairy
perhaps
i
can
show
you
one
before
she
comes
back
which
square
shall
it
be
this
time
i
had
the
red
and
the
yellow
and
the
green
and
ever
so
many
i
wonder
if
that
brown
one
has
a
good
story
to
it
you
might
choose
it
and
see
said
the
fairy
so
teddy
chose
that
one
and
then
the
fairy
began
to
count
one
two
three
four
five
she
counted
and
so
on
and
on
until
she
reached
why
how
funny
cried
teddy
he
was
nowhere
at
all
but
on
the
back
and
he
sat
there
just
as
naturally
as
though
he
were
not
in
a
story
at
all
then
the
back
gate
opened
and
in
through
it
came
a
little
withered
old
woman
wearing
a
brown
cloak
and
a
brown
hood
drawn
over
her
head
why
counterpane
fairy
cried
teddy
but
when
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
him
he
saw
that
it
was
not
the
counterpane
fairy
after
all
but
an
old
italian
woman
carrying
a
basket
on
her
arm
you
buy
something
leetle
boy
she
said
i
ca
said
teddy
i
have
any
money
except
what
in
my
bank
but
i
ask
hannah
and
maybe
she
will
so
saying
he
ran
into
the
kitchen
the
clock
was
ticking
on
the
wall
and
the
room
smelled
of
bread
but
it
was
empty
opening
the
door
of
the
stairway
teddy
called
hannah
hannah
there
was
no
answer
it
all
seemed
strangely
still
upstairs
she
must
have
gone
out
teddy
said
to
himself
when
he
went
back
to
the
outside
door
the
old
italian
had
put
down
her
basket
and
was
sitting
on
the
step
beside
it
she
did
not
seem
at
all
surprised
when
he
told
her
he
could
not
find
anyone

she
said
then

hand

dis
baskit
and
i
give
you
what

you
really
cried
teddy
yis
said
the
little
old
woman
smiling
and
her
smile
was
just
like
the
smile
of
the
counterpane
fairy
and
you
give
me
whatever
i
take
yis
said
the
little
old
woman
again
teddy
put
his
hand
in
under
the
cover
and
caught
hold
of
something
hard
and
cold
he
pulled
and
pulled
at
it
and
out
it
came
it
was
a
little
iron
shovel
you
take
something
more
said
the
little
old
woman
teddy
hesitated
but
when
he
looked
at
her
again
he
saw
that
she
really
meant
it
so
he
put
his
hand
in
and
this
time
he
pulled
out
a
large
iron
key
now
try
once
more
said
the
little
old
woman
and
this
third
time
it
was
a
baited
with
cheese
that
teddy
drew
from
the
basket
but
what
shall
i
do
with
them
he
asked
you
keep
dem
said
the
old
italian
and
you
find
you
need
dem
by
and
by
then
she
rose
and
pulling
her
cloak
over
the
basket
she
took
her
staff
in
her
other
hand
and
hobbled
down
the
pathway
teddy
slipped
the
key
into
his
pocket
and
holding
the
shovel
and
the
trap
he
ran
down
to
the
gate
to
open
it
for
her
he
stood
looking
after
her
as
she
went
on
down
the
street
her
staff
striking
the
bricks
sharply
tap
tap
tap
her
back
was
certainly
exactly
like
the
counterpane
fairy
as
he
walked
slowly
up
the
path
swinging
his
shovel
by
the
handle
he
noticed
that
there
was
a
just
back
of
the
and
he
thought
what
fun
it
would
be
to
dig
it
out
so
he
put
the
cage
down
on
the
ground
and
set
to
work
with
his
shovel
the
earth
broke
away
from
the
in
great
clods
and
he
found
it
so
easy
to
dig
that
very
soon
he
had
made
quite
a
big
hole
then
he
saw
that
down
in
this
hole
there
was
a
flight
of
stone
steps
leading
into
the
earth
why
is
that
funny
said
teddy
right
in
the
back
yard
too
i
wonder
where
they
go
tucking
the
shovel
under
his
arm
and
taking
the
trap
in
his
hand
teddy
stepped
into
the
and
began
to
go
down
the
stairs
he
went
on
down
and
down
and
down
and
at
last
he
came
to
an
iron
door
and
it
was
locked
teddy
tried
it
and
knocked
but
there
was
no
answer
he
listened
with
his
ear
against
it
but
he
heard
nothing
and
he
was
just
about
to
turn
and
go
up
the
stairs
again
when
he
remembered
the
key
the
little
old
woman
had
given
him
he
pulled
it
out
of
his
pocket
and
when
he
tried
it
in
the
keyhole
it
fitted
exactly
he
turned
it
the
door
flew
open
and
teddy
stepped
through
beyond
was
a
cave
just
such
as
he
had
often
wished
he
could
live
in
with
a
rough
table
and
chair
old
kegs
and
a
heap
of
rubbish
in
one
corner
on
each
side
of
the
cave
was
a
heavy
door
studded
with
iron
nails
i
will
just
see
where
these
doors
lead
to
said
teddy
to
himself
laying
his
trap
and
his
shovel
behind
one
of
the
kegs
as
he
reached
the
first
door
and
put
his
hand
on
it
he
heard
someone
singing
the
other
side
of
it
as
sweetly
and
clearly
as
a
bird
and
this
is
what
the
voice
sang
in
field
and
meadow
the
grasses
grow
the
clouds
are
white
and
the
winds
they
blow
out
in
the
world
there
is
much
to
see
if
i
were
but
free
if
i
were
but
free
my
wings
were
bright
and
my
wings
were
strong
i
plumed
myself
and
i
sang
a
song
where
is
the
hero
to
rescue
me
and
set
me
free
and
set
me
free
the
song
ended
and
teddy
opened
the
door
within
was
another
room
that
looked
almost
like
the
first
only
there
was
a
fireplace
in
it
and
in
front
of
this
fireplace
a
young
girl
was
sitting
as
soon
as
teddy
opened
the
door
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
and
when
she
saw
him
she
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
glad
cry
and
clasped
her
hands
oh
she
cried
have
you
come
to
rescue
me
who
are
you
asked
teddy
wondering
at
her
she
was
very
beautiful
her
eyes
were
as
bright
and
black
as
a
sloe
her
hair
shone
like
threads
of
pure
gold
and
she
wore
a
long
cloak
of
golden
feathers
over
her
shoulders
when
teddy
spoke
she
answered
him
i
am
avis
the
and
how
did
you
come
here
asked
teddy
then
the
told
him
how
she
used
to
live
in
a
golden
castle
that
was
all
her
own
how
she
ate
from
crystal
dishes
and
bathed
every
morning
in
a
little
marble
and
had
nothing
to
do
all
day
but
swing
in
her
golden
swing
and
sing
for
her
own
pleasure
but
after
a
while
she
grew
tired
of
all
this
and
began
to
wonder
what
the
outside
world
was
like
and
one
the
day
the
sun
was
so
bright
and
the
air
so
sweet
that
she
left
her
home
and
flew
out
into
the
wide
wide
world
that
was
all
very
pleasant
until
she
grew
tired
and
sat
down
on
a
stone
to
rest
then
a
great
brown
robber
came
and
caught
her
and
carried
her
down
into
his
den
and
there
he
kept
her
a
prisoner
in
spite
of
her
tears
and
prayers
and
there
she
must
wait
on
him
and
keep
his
house
in
order
every
day
he
went
out
and
left
her
along
coming
back
loaded
down
with
food
or
golden
treasure
that
he
had
stolen
but
why
do
you
run
away
asked
teddy
i
would
alas
i
ca
said
the
for
whenever
the
goes
out
he
locks
the
door
after
him
and
i
have
no
key
to
open
it
then
teddy
told
her
that
he
had
a
key
that
would
unlock
the
door
and
that
he
would
save
her
the
was
very
glad
but
she
said
they
must
make
haste
for
it
was
almost
time
for
the
robber
to
come
home
so
she
wrapped
her
cloak
around
her
and
teddy
took
her
by
the
hand
and
together
they
ran
to
the
door
they
had
hardly
reached
the
outer
cave
however
when
teddy
heard
a
loud
bang
that
echoed
and
from
the
walls
alas
alas
cried
the
shrinking
back
and
beginning
to
wring
her
hands
we
are
too
late
there
comes
the
robber
and
now
we
will
never
escape
she
had
scarcely
said
this
when
in
marched
the
sure
enough
he
wore
a
great
soft
hat
pulled
down
over
his
face
and
he
had
a
long
brown
nose
and
little
black
beads
of
eyes
his
mustache
stuck
out
on
each
side
like
swords
and
he
carried
a
great
sack
over
his
shoulder
the
threw
the
sack
down
on
the
floor
and
frowned
at
teddy
from
under
his
hat
how
now
he
cried
who
this
who
has
come
down
into
my
cavern
without
even
so
much
as
a
your
leave
teddy
felt
rather
frightened
but
he
spoke
up
bravely
i
teddy
he
said
and
i
did
know
this
was
your
cave
i
thought
it
was
just
a
a
cried
the
bursting
into
a
roar
of
laughter
a
my
cave
a
ho
ho
ho
yes
i
did
said
teddy
and
i
did
know
it
was
yours
but
if
you
want
me
to
go
i
will
not
so
fast
said
the
robber
sometimes
it
is
easier
to
come
into
my
cave
than
to
go
out
and
you
must
sit
down
and
have
some
supper
with
me
now
that
you
are
here
teddy
was
quite
willing
to
do
that
for
he
was
really
hungry
so
he
and
the
robber
drew
chairs
up
to
the
table
and
the
at
a
gesture
from
the
robber
picked
up
the
sack
that
he
had
thrown
upon
the
ground
and
out
from
it
she
drew
some
pieces
of
bread
and
some
bits
of
cold
meat
it
did
not
look
particularly
good
but
it
seemed
to
be
all
there
was
so
when
the
robber
began
to
eat
teddy
helped
himself
too
the
did
not
take
off
his
hat
and
he
ate
very
fast
after
a
while
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
began
to
tell
teddy
what
a
great
magician
he
was
and
about
his
treasure
chamber
there
he
said
is
where
i
keep
my
gold
i
have
gold
and
gold
and
gold
great
bars
and
lumps
and
crusts
of
gold
all
piled
up
in
my
treasure
chamber
at
last
he
rose
pushed
back
his
chair
and
bade
teddy
follow
him
and
he
should
see
how
great
and
rich
he
was
leading
the
way
across
the
cave
he
unlocked
the
third
door
and
flinging
it
open
stepped
back
so
that
teddy
might
look
in
as
he
opened
it
a
very
curious
smell
came
out
teddy
stared
and
stared
about
the
treasure
chamber
but
where
is
the
gold
he
said
there
right
before
your
eyes
said
the
robber
do
you
see
it
why
that
is
gold
that
nothing
but
cheese
cried
teddy
cheese
cheese
cried
the
stamping
his
foot
in
a
rage
i
tell
you
it
gold
it
is
it
cheese
said
teddy
look
i
have
some
just
like
it
i
show
you
and
running
to
the
keg
where
he
had
left
his
trap
he
pulled
it
out
and
held
it
up
for
the
robber
to
see
as
soon
as
the
saw
the
cheese
in
the
trap
his
fingers
began
to
work
and
his
mouth
to
water
oh
what
a
fine
rich
piece
of
gold
he
cried
how
do
you
get
it
out
i
do
know
said
teddy
i
do
think
it
comes
out
there
must
be
some
way
cried
the
robber
let
me
see
and
taking
the
trap
from
teddy
he
put
it
down
on
the
floor
and
began
to
pick
and
pry
at
the
bars
but
he
could
not
get
the
cheese
out
and
the
more
he
tried
the
more
eager
he
grew
there
one
way
he
muttered
to
himself
looking
up
at
teddy
suspiciously
from
under
his
slouch
hat
how
is
that
asked
teddy
if
one
were
only
a
rat
one
could
get
at
it
fast
enough
said
the
yes
but
you
not
said
teddy
all
the
same
it
might
be
managed
said
the
magician
again
he
tore
and
tore
at
the
bars
and
he
grew
so
eager
that
he
seemed
to
forget
about
everything
but
the
cheese
i
do
it
he
cried
yes
i
will
then
he
laid
of
his
great
soft
hat
and
crossing
his
forefingers
he
cried
innocent
me
innocent
me
as
i
was
once
again
i
will
be
and
now
the
magician
nose
grew
longer
his
mustache
grew
thin
and
stiff
like
whiskers
his
sword
changed
to
a
long
tail
and
in
a
minute
he
was
nothing
at
all
but
a
great
brown
rat
that
ran
into
the
trap
click
went
the
trap
and
there
he
was
fastened
in
with
the
cheese
it
was
in
vain
that
he
shook
the
bars
and
squeaked
quick
quick
cried
the
let
us
escape
before
he
can
use
his
spells
she
caught
teddy
by
the
hand
and
together
they
ran
to
the
door
that
led
to
the
stairway
your
key
oh
make
haste
cried
the
breathlessly
in
a
moment
teddy
had
unlocked
the
door
they
had
passed
through
and
it
had
swung
to
behind
them
up
the
stairs
they
ran
and
there
they
were
standing
in
the
sunlight
near
the
i
am
free
i
am
free
cried
the
joyously
oh
thank
you
little
boy
and
now
for
home
she
caught
the
edges
of
her
cloak
and
spread
it
wide
and
as
she
did
so
it
changed
to
wings
her
head
grew
round
and
covered
with
feathers
and
with
a
glad
cry
she
sprang
from
the
earth
and
flew
up
and
away
and
out
of
sight
through
the
sunlight
why
it
harriett
canary
cried
teddy
and
now
i
must
go
said
the
counterpane
fairy
teddy
was
back
in
the
the
sun
was
low
and
a
broad
band
of
pale
sunlight
lay
across
the
foot
of
the
bed
the
fairy
was
just
starting
down
the
counterpane
hill
was
it
really
harriett
canary

teddy
i
have
time
to
talk
of

the
counterpane
fairy
for

mother

and
sure
enough
she
had
scarcely
disappeared
behind
the
counterpane
hill
when
his
mamma
came
in
oh

cried
teddy
do
you
think
harriett
canary

said
his
mother
then
she
put
a
little
package
into
his
hand
do
you
think
harriett
will
like
that
she
asked
when
teddy
opened
the
bundle
he
saw
a
cunning
little
bisque
doll
that
sat
in
a
little
tin
you
could
take
the
doll
out
and
dress
it
or
you
could
really
bathe
it
in
the
tub
oh

cried
teddy
with
delight

little
cousin
harriett

hope

said
mamma
chapter
tenth
the
counterpane
fairy
says
teddy
was
to
go
the
next
day
if
it
was
mild
and
pleasant
the
doctor
had
come
in
that
morning
for
the
last
time
to
see
him
well
my
little
man
he
had
said
giving
teddy
cheek
a
pinch
ca
be
pretending
you
a
sick
boy
any
longer
with
cheeks
and
eye
like
these
now
we
have
you
back
at
school
in
no
time
and
then
i
suppose
be
up
to
all
your
old
tricks
again
later
on
the
little
boy
had
gone
downstairs
for
dinner
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
been
everything
there
had
looked
very
strange
to
him
and
as
if
he
had
not
seen
it
for
years
he
had
felt
just
as
well
as
ever
until
he
tried
to
chase
the
cat
muggins
down
the
hall
and
then
his
legs
had
given
way
in
a
funny
weak
fashion
that
made
him
laugh
after
dinner
muggins
followed
him
upstairs
and
curling
down
under
a
chair
went
fast
asleep
teddy
took
his
blocks
and
built
them
about
the
chair
so
that
when
the
cat
woke
he
found
himself
built
up
inside
a
little
house
however
a
door
had
been
left
and
he
poked
his
nose
and
his
paw
through
it
and
then
the
whole
front
wall
went
down
with
a
noisy
clatter
and
muggins
scampered
down
to
the
kitchen
with
his
tail
on
end
teddy
had
to
laugh
he
looked
so
funny
papa
came
home
from
his
office
earlier
than
usual
that
afternoon
bringing
with
him
a
bundle
of
long
smooth
sticks
and
a
roll
of
tissue
papers
and
spent
all
the
rest
of
the
time
between
that
and
supper
in
making
a
great
kite
for
teddy
he
told
the
little
boy
that
if
the
next
day
were
fine
he
would
fly
it
for
him
and
that
he
might
ask
some
of
the
boys
to
come
and
help
teddy
had
never
seen
such
a
large
kite
before
when
papa
stood
it
up
it
was
a
great
deal
taller
than
the
little
boy
himself
the
gold
star
that
was
pasted
on
where
the
sticks
crossed
was
just
on
a
level
with
his
eyes
so
much
seemed
to
have
happened
that
day
that
very
soon
after
supper
teddy
felt
tired
and
was
quite
willing
to
let
mamma
undress
him
and
put
him
to
bed
it
felt
very
good
to
lie
down
between
the
cool
sheets
again
and
very
soon
teddy
eyelids
began
to
blink
heavily
and
he
was
already
drifting
off
into
that
blissful
feeling
that
comes
just
as
one
is
going
to
sleep
when
he
became
dimly
conscious
of
a
faint
sound
of
music
at
first
half
asleep
as
he
was
he
thought
that
it
must
be
little
cousin
harriett
winding
up
the
in
the
room
and
then
he
suddenly
started
into
consciousness
with
the
remembrance
that
he
was
alone
and
that
it
could
be
cousin
harriett
she
was
at
home
in
bed
perhaps
already
the
music
seemed
to
sound
quite
near
him
and
it
was
very
sweet
and
soft
now
that
he
was
awake
it
sounded
more
like
the
voice
of
the
singing
garden
than
anything
else
suddenly
a
faint
rosy
light
appeared
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
standing
in
it
was
the
most
beautiful
lady
that
teddy
had
ever
seen
she
was
quite
tall
as
tall
as
his
own
mother
and
not
even
the
fairy
rosine
or
the
no
nor
the
princess
aureline
herself
had
been
half
as
beautiful
but
though
the
lady
was
so
lovely
there
was
something
very
familiar
about
her
face
why
counterpane
fairy
cried
teddy
the
counterpane
fairy
for
it
was
indeed
she
did
not
speak
but
smiling
at
teddy
she
moved
softly
and
smoothly
as
though
swept
along
by
the
music
to
the
side
of
the
bed
and
still
smiling
she
bent
above
the
little
boy
as
he
looked
up
into
the
face
that
leaned
above
him
it
seemed
to
change
in
some
strange
way
and
now
it
was
the
old
italian
woman
who
had
given
him
the
presents
from
her
basket
a
moment
after
it
was
the
face
of
the
little
child
who
had
talked
with
him
upon
the
rainbow
no
it
was
not
it
was
really
the
counterpane
fairy
herself
and
no
one
else
closer
and
closer
she
leaned
above
him
seeming
to
enfold
him
with
faint
music
and
light
and
perfume
she
whispered
softly
little
boy
oh
counterpane
fairy
where
are
you
going
do
go
away
cried
teddy
i
not
going
away
said
the
fairy
i
shall
be
beside
you
still
just
as
often
as
ever
only
you
wo
see
me
but
wo
there
be
any
more
stories
cried
teddy
in
dismay
sometime
perhaps
said
the
counterpane
fairy
but
not
now
for
you
be
out
and
playing
with
the
other
boys
and
after
that
it
will
be
your
school
and
your
games
that
you
be
thinking
of
oh
counterpane
fairy
do
go
cried
teddy
again
reaching
out
his
arms
toward
her
but
they
touched
nothing
but
empty
air
waving
her
hand
to
him
and
still
smiling
the
counterpane
fairy
slowly
slowly
faded
away
with
her
too
faded
the
rosy
light
and
the
perfume
that
had
filled
the
room
only
the
faint
sound
of
music
was
left
then
it
too
died
away
teddy
sat
up
and
looked
about
him
the
room
was
very
still
and
dim
he
heard
nothing
but
the
ticking
of
the
clock
the
had
sailed
up
above
the
dark
tops
of
the
on
the
lawn
outside
and
by
its
light
he
saw
the
great
kite
that
papa
had
made
him
as
it
stood
propped
up
on
the
mantle
the
gilt
star
in
the
middle
of
it
shone
it
was
true
that
he
was
no
longer
a
little
sick
child
he
would
be
again
and
shouting
and
playing
with
all
the
other
boys
