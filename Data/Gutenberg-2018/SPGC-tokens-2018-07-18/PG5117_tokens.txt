the
meaning
of
truth
a
sequel
to
by
william
james
preface
the
pivotal
part
of
my
book
named
pragmatism
is
its
account
of
the
relation
called
which
may
obtain
between
an
idea
opinion
belief
statement
or
what
not
and
its
object
i
there
say
a
property
of
certain
of
our
ideas
it
means
their
agreement
as
falsity
means
their
disagreement
with
reality
pragmatists
and
intellectualists
both
accept
this
definition
as
a
matter
of
course
our
ideas
do
not
copy
definitely
their
object
what
does
agreement
with
that
object
mean
pragmatism
asks
its
usual
question
grant
an
idea
or
belief
to
be
true
it
says
what
concrete
difference
will
its
being
true
make
in
any
one
actual
life
what
experiences
may
be
different
from
those
which
would
obtain
if
the
belief
were
false
how
will
the
truth
be
realized
what
in
short
is
the
in
experiential
terms
the
moment
pragmatism
asks
this
question
it
sees
the
answer
true
ideas
are
those
that
we
can
assimilate
validate
corroborate
and
verify
false
ideas
are
those
that
we
can
not
that
is
the
practical
difference
it
makes
to
us
to
have
true
ideas
that
therefore
is
the
meaning
of
truth
for
it
is
all
that
truth
is
known
as
truth
of
an
idea
is
not
a
stagnant
property
inherent
in
it
truth
happens
to
an
idea
it
becomes
true
is
made
true
by
events
its
verity
is
in
fact
an
event
a
process
the
process
namely
of
its
verifying
itself
its
verification
its
validity
is
the
process
of
its
validation
footnote
but
i
add
as
good
as
verification
for
one
completed
there
are
a
million
in
our
lives
that
function
in
the
state
of
nascency
they
lead
us
towards
direct
verification
lead
us
into
the
surroundings
of
the
object
they
envisage
and
then
if
everything
runs
on
harmoniously
we
are
so
sure
that
verification
is
possible
that
we
omit
it
and
are
usually
justified
by
all
that
happens
agree
in
the
widest
sense
with
a
reality
can
only
mean
to
be
guided
either
straight
up
to
it
or
into
its
surroundings
or
to
be
put
into
such
working
touch
with
it
as
to
handle
either
it
or
something
connected
with
it
better
than
if
we
disagreed
better
either
intellectually
or
practically
any
idea
that
helps
us
to
deal
whether
practically
or
intellectually
with
either
the
reality
or
its
belongings
that
entangle
our
progress
in
frustrations
that
fits
in
fact
and
adapts
our
life
to
the
reality
whole
setting
will
agree
sufficiently
to
meet
the
requirement
it
will
be
true
of
that
reality
true
to
put
it
very
briefly
is
only
the
expedient
in
the
way
of
our
thinking
just
as
the
right
is
only
the
expedient
in
the
way
of
our
behaving
expedient
in
almost
any
fashion
and
expedient
in
the
long
run
and
on
the
whole
of
course
for
what
meets
expediently
all
the
experience
in
sight
wo
necessarily
meet
all
farther
experiences
equally
satisfactorily
experience
as
we
know
has
ways
of
boiling
over
and
making
us
correct
our
present
formulas
this
account
of
truth
following
upon
the
similar
ones
given
by
dewey
and
schiller
has
occasioned
the
liveliest
discussion
few
critics
have
defended
it
most
of
them
have
scouted
it
it
seems
evident
that
the
subject
is
a
hard
one
to
understand
under
its
apparent
simplicity
and
evident
also
i
think
that
the
definitive
settlement
of
it
will
mark
a
in
the
history
of
epistemology
and
consequently
in
that
of
general
philosophy
in
order
to
make
my
own
thought
more
accessible
to
those
who
hereafter
may
have
to
study
the
question
i
have
collected
in
the
volume
that
follows
all
the
work
of
my
pen
that
bears
directly
on
the
my
first
statement
was
in
in
the
article
that
begins
the
present
volume
the
other
papers
follow
in
the
order
of
their
publication
two
or
three
appear
now
for
the
first
time
one
of
the
accusations
which
i
oftenest
have
had
to
meet
is
that
of
making
the
truth
of
our
religious
beliefs
consist
in
their
good
to
us
and
in
nothing
else
i
regret
to
have
given
some
excuse
for
this
charge
by
the
unguarded
language
in
which
in
the
book
pragmatism
i
spoke
of
the
truth
of
the
belief
of
certain
philosophers
in
the
absolute
explaining
why
i
do
not
believe
in
the
absolute
myself
yet
finding
that
it
may
secure
holidays
to
those
who
need
them
and
is
true
in
so
far
forth
if
to
gain
moral
holidays
be
a
good
footnote
op
p
i
offered
this
as
a
conciliatory
to
my
enemies
but
they
as
is
only
too
common
with
such
offerings
trampled
the
gift
under
foot
and
turned
and
rent
the
giver
i
had
counted
too
much
on
their
good
will
oh
for
the
rarity
of
christian
charity
under
the
sun
oh
for
the
rarity
of
ordinary
secular
intelligence
also
i
had
supposed
it
to
be
matter
of
common
observation
that
of
two
competing
views
of
the
universe
which
in
all
other
respects
are
equal
but
of
which
the
first
denies
some
vital
human
need
while
the
second
satisfies
it
the
second
will
be
favored
by
sane
men
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
makes
the
world
seem
more
rational
to
choose
the
first
view
under
such
circumstances
would
be
an
ascetic
act
an
act
of
philosophic
of
which
no
normal
human
being
would
be
guilty
using
the
pragmatic
test
of
the
meaning
of
concepts
i
had
shown
the
concept
of
the
absolute
to
mean
nothing
but
the
holiday
giver
the
banisher
of
cosmic
fear
one
objective
deliverance
when
one
says
absolute
exists
amounted
on
my
showing
just
to
this
that
justification
of
a
feeling
of
security
in
presence
of
the
universe
exists
and
that
systematically
to
refuse
to
cultivate
a
feeling
of
security
would
be
to
do
violence
to
a
tendency
in
one
emotional
life
which
might
well
be
respected
as
prophetic
apparently
my
absolutist
critics
fail
to
see
the
workings
of
their
own
minds
in
any
such
picture
so
all
that
i
can
do
is
to
apologize
and
take
my
offering
back
the
absolute
is
true
in
no
way
then
and
least
of
all
by
the
verdict
of
the
critics
in
the
way
which
i
assigned
my
treatment
of
and
was
similar
reducing
by
the
pragmatic
test
the
meaning
of
each
of
these
concepts
to
its
positive
experienceable
operation
i
showed
them
all
to
mean
the
same
thing
the
presence
of
in
the
world
or
no
god
means
or
no
promise
it
seems
to
me
that
the
alternative
is
objective
enough
being
a
question
as
to
whether
the
cosmos
has
one
character
or
another
even
though
our
own
provisional
answer
be
made
on
subjective
grounds
nevertheless
christian
and
critics
alike
accuse
me
of
summoning
people
to
say
exists
even
when
he
does
exist
because
forsooth
in
my
philosophy
the
of
the
saying
does
really
mean
that
he
exists
in
any
shape
whatever
but
only
that
to
say
so
feels
good
most
of
the
pragmatist
and
warfare
is
over
what
the
word
shall
be
held
to
signify
and
not
over
any
of
the
facts
embodied
in
for
both
pragmatists
and
believe
in
existent
objects
just
as
they
believe
in
our
ideas
of
them
the
difference
is
that
when
the
pragmatists
speak
of
truth
they
mean
exclusively
some
thing
about
the
ideas
namely
their
workableness
whereas
when
speak
of
truth
they
seem
most
often
to
mean
something
about
the
objects
since
the
pragmatist
if
he
agrees
that
an
idea
is
true
also
agrees
to
whatever
it
says
about
its
object
and
since
most
have
already
come
round
to
agreeing
that
if
the
object
exists
the
idea
that
it
does
so
is
workable
there
would
seem
so
little
left
to
fight
about
that
i
might
well
be
asked
why
instead
of
reprinting
my
share
in
so
much
verbal
wrangling
i
do
not
show
my
sense
of
by
burning
it
all
up
i
understand
the
question
and
i
will
give
my
answer
i
am
interested
in
another
doctrine
in
philosophy
to
which
i
give
the
name
of
radical
empiricism
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
establishment
of
the
pragmatist
theory
of
truth
is
a
step
of
importance
in
making
radical
empiricism
prevail
radical
empiricism
consists
first
of
a
postulate
next
of
a
statement
of
fact
and
finally
of
a
generalized
conclusion
the
postulate
is
that
the
only
things
that
shall
be
debatable
among
philosophers
shall
be
things
definable
in
terms
drawn
from
experience
things
of
an
unexperienceable
nature
may
exist
ad
libitum
but
they
form
no
part
of
the
material
for
philosophic
debate
the
statement
of
fact
is
that
the
relations
between
things
conjunctive
as
well
as
disjunctive
are
just
as
much
matters
of
direct
particular
experience
neither
more
so
nor
less
so
than
the
things
themselves
the
generalized
conclusion
is
that
therefore
the
parts
of
experience
hold
together
from
next
to
next
by
relations
that
are
themselves
parts
of
experience
the
directly
apprehended
universe
needs
in
short
no
extraneous
connective
support
but
possesses
in
its
own
right
a
concatenated
or
continuous
structure
the
great
obstacle
to
radical
empiricism
in
the
contemporary
mind
is
the
rooted
rationalist
belief
that
experience
as
immediately
given
is
all
disjunction
and
no
conjunction
and
that
to
make
one
world
out
of
this
separateness
a
higher
unifying
agency
must
be
there
in
the
prevalent
idealism
this
agency
is
represented
as
the
absolute
which
things
together
by
throwing
over
them
like
a
net
the
most
peculiar
and
unique
perhaps
of
all
these
categories
is
supposed
to
be
the
which
connects
parts
of
reality
in
pairs
making
of
one
of
them
a
knower
and
of
the
other
a
thing
known
yet
which
is
itself
contentless
experientially
neither
describable
explicable
nor
reduceable
to
lower
terms
and
denotable
only
by
uttering
the
name
the
pragmatist
view
on
the
contrary
of
the
is
that
it
has
a
definite
content
and
that
everything
in
it
is
experienceable
its
whole
nature
can
be
told
in
positive
terms
the
which
ideas
must
have
in
order
to
be
true
means
particular
workings
physical
or
intellectual
actual
or
possible
which
they
may
set
up
from
next
to
next
inside
of
concrete
experience
were
this
pragmatic
contention
admitted
one
great
point
in
the
victory
of
radical
empiricism
would
also
be
scored
for
the
relation
between
an
object
and
the
idea
that
truly
knows
it
is
held
by
rationalists
to
be
nothing
of
this
describable
sort
but
to
stand
outside
of
all
possible
temporal
experience
and
on
the
relation
so
interpreted
rationalism
is
wonted
to
make
its
last
most
obdurate
rally
now
the
contentions
which
i
try
to
meet
in
this
volume
can
be
so
easily
used
by
rationalists
as
weapons
of
resistance
not
only
to
pragmatism
but
to
radical
empiricism
also
for
if
the
were
transcendent
others
might
be
so
too
that
i
feel
strongly
the
strategical
importance
of
having
them
definitely
met
and
got
out
of
the
way
what
our
critics
most
persistently
keep
saying
is
that
though
workings
go
with
truth
yet
they
do
not
constitute
it
it
is
numerically
additional
to
them
prior
to
them
explanatory
of
them
and
in
no
wise
to
be
explained
by
them
we
are
incessantly
told
the
first
point
for
our
enemies
to
establish
therefore
is
that
something
numerically
additional
and
prior
to
the
workings
is
involved
in
the
truth
of
an
idea
since
the
object
is
additional
and
usually
prior
most
rationalists
plead
it
and
boldly
accuse
us
of
denying
it
this
leaves
on
the
bystanders
the
impression
since
we
can
not
reasonably
deny
the
existence
of
the
object
that
our
account
of
truth
breaks
down
and
that
our
critics
have
driven
us
from
the
field
altho
in
various
places
in
this
volume
i
try
to
refute
the
slanderous
charge
that
we
deny
real
existence
i
will
say
here
again
for
the
sake
of
emphasis
that
the
existence
of
the
object
whenever
the
idea
asserts
it
is
the
only
reason
in
innumerable
cases
why
the
idea
does
work
successfully
if
it
work
at
all
and
that
it
seems
an
abuse
of
language
to
say
the
least
to
transfer
the
word
from
the
idea
to
the
existence
when
the
falsehood
of
ideas
that
wo
work
is
explained
by
that
existence
as
well
as
the
truth
of
those
that
will
i
find
this
abuse
prevailing
among
my
most
accomplished
adversaries
but
once
establish
the
proper
verbal
custom
let
the
word
represent
a
property
of
the
idea
cease
to
make
it
something
mysteriously
connected
with
the
object
known
and
the
path
opens
fair
and
wide
as
i
believe
to
the
discussion
of
radical
empiricism
on
its
merits
the
truth
of
an
idea
will
then
mean
only
its
workings
or
that
in
it
which
by
ordinary
psychological
laws
sets
up
those
workings
it
will
mean
neither
the
idea
object
nor
anything
inside
the
idea
that
terms
drawn
from
experience
can
not
describe
one
word
more
ere
i
end
this
preface
a
distinction
is
sometimes
made
between
dewey
schiller
and
myself
as
if
i
in
supposing
the
existence
made
a
concession
to
popular
prejudice
which
they
as
more
radical
pragmatists
refuse
to
make
as
i
myself
understand
these
authors
we
all
three
absolutely
agree
in
admitting
the
transcendency
of
the
object
provided
it
be
an
experienceable
object
to
the
subject
in
the
dewey
in
particular
has
insisted
almost
ad
nauseam
that
the
whole
meaning
of
our
cognitive
states
and
processes
lies
in
the
way
they
intervene
in
the
control
and
revaluation
of
independent
existences
or
facts
his
account
of
knowledge
is
not
only
absurd
but
meaningless
unless
independent
existences
be
there
of
which
our
ideas
take
account
and
for
the
transformation
of
which
they
work
but
because
he
and
schiller
refuse
to
discuss
objects
and
relations
in
the
sense
of
being
altogether
their
critics
pounce
on
sentences
in
their
writings
to
that
effect
to
show
that
they
deny
the
existence
within
the
realm
of
experience
of
objects
external
to
the
ideas
that
declare
their
presence
there
footnote
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
welcome
professor

read
into
the
pragmatistic
church
so
far
as
his
epistemology
goes
see
his
vigorous
book

the

what
is

by

which
i
make
the
acquaintance
only

correcting
these
proofs
contains
some
striking
anticipations
of
the
later
pragmatist
view
the
psychology
of
thinking
by
irving
miller
new

macmillan
which
has
just
appeared
is
one
of
the
most
convincing
pragmatist
document
yet
published
tho
it
does
not
use
the
word
at
all
while
i
am
making
references
i
can
not
refrain
from
inserting
one
to
the
extraordinarily
acute
article
by
knox
in
the
quarterly
review
for
april
it
seems
incredible
that
educated
and
apparently
sincere
critics
should
so
fail
to
catch
their
adversary
point
of
view
what
misleads
so
many
of
them
is
possibly
also
the
fact
that
the
universes
of
discourse
of
schiller
dewey
and
myself
are
panoramas
of
different
extent
and
that
what
the
one
postulates
explicitly
the
other
provisionally
leaves
only
in
a
state
of
implication
while
the
reader
thereupon
considers
it
to
be
denied
schiller
universe
is
the
smallest
being
essentially
a
psychological
one
he
starts
with
but
one
sort
of
thing
but
is
led
ultimately
to
the
independent
objective
facts
which
they
assert
inasmuch
as
the
most
successfully
validated
of
all
claims
is
that
such
facts
are
there
my
universe
is
more
essentially
epistemological
i
start
with
two
things
the
objective
facts
and
the
claims
and
indicate
which
claims
the
facts
being
there
will
work
successfully
as
the
latter
substitutes
and
which
will
not
i
call
the
former
claims
true
dewey
panorama
if
i
understand
this
colleague
is
the
widest
of
the
three
but
i
refrain
from
giving
my
own
account
of
its
complexity
suffice
it
that
he
holds
as
firmly
as
i
do
to
objects
independent
of
our
judgments
if
i
am
wrong
in
saying
this
he
must
correct
me
i
decline
in
this
matter
to
be
corrected
at
second
hand
i
have
not
pretended
in
the
following
pages
to
consider
all
the

this
and
the
following
articles
have
received
a
very
slight
verbal
revision
consisting
mostly
in
the
omission
of
redundancy
the
following
inquiry
is
to
use
a
distinction
familiar
to
readers
of
shadworth
hodgson
not
an
inquiry
into
the
it
comes
but
into
the
it
is
of
cognition
what
we
call
acts
of
cognition
are
evidently
realized
through
what
we
call
brains
and
their
events
whether
there
be
dynamically
connected
with
the
brains
or
not
but
with
neither
brains
nor
souls
has
this
essay
any
business
to
transact
in
it
we
shall
simply
assume
that
cognition
is
produced
somehow
and
limit
ourselves
to
asking
what
elements
it
contains
what
factors
it
implies
cognition
is
a
function
of
consciousness
the
first
factor
it
implies
is
therefore
a
state
of
consciousness
wherein
the
cognition
shall
take
place
having
elsewhere
used
the
word
to
designate
generically
all
states
of
consciousness
considered
subjectively
or
without
respect
to
their
possible
function
i
shall
then
say
that
whatever
elements
an
act
of
cognition
may
imply
besides
it
at
least
implies
the
existence
of
a
feeling
if
the
reader
share
the
current
antipathy
to
the
word
he
may
substitute
for
it
wherever
i
use
it
the
word
taken
in
the
old
broad
lockian
sense
or
he
may
use
the
clumsy
phrase
of
consciousness
or
finally
he
may
say
instead
now
it
is
to
be
observed
that
the
common
consent
of
mankind
has
agreed
that
some
feelings
are
cognitive
and
some
are
simple
facts
having
a
subjective
or
what
one
might
almost
call
a
physical
existence
but
no
such
function
as
would
be
implied
in
their
being
pieces
of
knowledge
our
task
is
again
limited
here
we
are
not
to
ask
is
possible
we
are
only
to
ask
comes
it
that
common
sense
has
assigned
a
number
of
cases
in
which
it
is
assumed
not
only
to
be
possible
but
actual
and
what
are
the
marks
used
by
common
sense
to
distinguish
those
cases
from
the
rest
in
short
our
inquiry
is
a
chapter
in
descriptive
psychology
hardly
anything
more
condillac
embarked
on
a
quest
similar
to
this
by
his
famous
hypothesis
of
a
statue
to
which
various
feelings
were
successively
imparted
its
first
feeling
was
supposed
to
be
one
of
fragrance
but
to
avoid
all
possible
complication
with
the
question
of
genesis
let
us
not
attribute
even
to
a
statue
the
possession
of
our
imaginary
feeling
let
us
rather
suppose
it
attached
to
no
matter
nor
localized
at
any
point
in
space
but
left
swinging
in
vacuo
as
it
were
by
the
direct
creative
fiat
of
a
god
and
let
us
also
to
escape
entanglement
with
difficulties
about
the
physical
or
psychical
nature
of
its
not
call
it
a
feeling
of
fragrance
or
of
any
other
determinate
sort
but
limit
ourselves
to
assuming
that
it
is
a
feeling
of
q
what
is
true
of
it
under
this
abstract
name
will
be
no
less
true
of
it
in
any
more
particular
shape
such
as
fragrance
pain
hardness
which
the
reader
may
suppose
now
if
this
feeling
of
q
be
the
only
creation
of
the
god
it
will
of
course
form
the
entire
universe
and
if
to
escape
the
cavils
of
that
large
class
of
persons
who
believe
that
semper
idem
sentire
ac
non
sentire
are
the
same
relativity
of
knowledge
held
in
this
sense
is
it
may
be
observed
in
passing
one
of
the
oddest
of
philosophic
superstitions
whatever
facts
may
be
cited
in
its
favor
are
due
to
the
properties
of
which
may
be
exhausted
by
too
prolonged
an
excitement
patients
with
neuralgias
that
last
unremittingly
for
days
can
however
assure
us
that
the
limits
of
this
are
pretty
widely
drawn
but
if
we
physically
could
get
a
feeling
that
should
last
eternally
unchanged
what
atom
of
logical
or
psychological
argument
is
there
to
prove
that
it
would
not
be
felt
as
long
as
it
lasted
and
felt
for
just
what
it
is
all
that
time
the
reason
for
the
opposite
prejudice
seems
to
be
our
reluctance
to
think
that
so
stupid
a
thing
as
such
a
feeling
would
necessarily
be
should
be
allowed
to
fill
eternity
with
its
presence
an
interminable
acquaintance
leading
to
no
such
would
be
its
condition
we
allow
the
feeling
to
be
of
as
short
a
duration
as
they
like
that
universe
will
only
need
to
last
an
infinitesimal
part
of
a
second
the
feeling
in
question
will
thus
be
reduced
to
its
fighting
weight
and
all
that
befalls
it
in
the
way
of
a
cognitive
function
must
be
held
to
befall
in
the
brief
instant
of
its
quickly
life
a
life
it
will
also
be
noticed
that
has
no
other
moment
of
consciousness
either
preceding
or
following
it
well
now
can
our
little
feeling
thus
left
alone
in
the
universe
for
the
god
and
we
psychological
critics
may
be
supposed
left
out
of
the
account
can
the
feeling
i
say
be
said
to
have
any
sort
of
a
cognitive
function
for
it
to
know
there
must
be
something
to
be
known
what
is
there
on
the
present
supposition
one
may
reply
content
q
but
does
it
not
seem
more
proper
to
call
this
the
quality
than
its
content
does
not
the
word
suggest
that
the
feeling
has
already
dirempted
itself
as
an
act
from
its
content
as
an
object
and
would
it
be
quite
safe
to
assume
so
promptly
that
the
quality
q
of
a
feeling
is
one
and
the
same
thing
with
a
feeling
of
the
quality
q
the
quality
q
so
far
is
an
entirely
subjective
fact
which
the
feeling
carries
so
to
speak
endogenously
or
in
its
pocket
if
any
one
pleases
to
dignify
so
simple
a
fact
as
this
by
the
name
of
knowledge
of
course
nothing
can
prevent
him
but
let
us
keep
closer
to
the
path
of
common
usage
and
reserve
the
name
knowledge
for
the
cognition
of
meaning
by
realities
things
that
exist
independently
of
the
feeling
through
which
their
cognition
occurs
if
the
content
of
the
feeling
occur
nowhere
in
the
universe
outside
of
the
feeling
itself
and
perish
with
the
feeling
common
usage
refuses
to
call
it
a
reality
and
brands
it
as
a
subjective
feature
of
the
feeling
constitution
or
at
the
most
as
the
feeling
dream
for
the
feeling
to
be
cognitive
in
the
specific
sense
then
it
must
be
and
we
must
prevail
upon
the
god
to
create
a
reality
outside
of
it
to
correspond
to
its
intrinsic
quality
q
thus
only
can
it
be
redeemed
from
the
condition
of
being
a
solipsism
if
now
the
new
created
reality
resemble
the
feeling
quality
q
i
say
that
the
feeling
may
be
held
by
us
to
be
cognizant
of
that
reality
this
first
instalment
of
my
thesis
is
sure
to
be
attacked
but
one
word
before
defending
it
has
become
our
warrant
for
calling
a
feeling
cognitive
but
what
becomes
our
warrant
for
calling
anything
reality
the
only
reply
is
the
faith
of
the
present
critic
or
inquirer
at
every
moment
of
his
life
he
finds
himself
subject
to
a
belief
in
some
realities
even
though
his
realities
of
this
year
should
prove
to
be
his
illusions
of
the
next
whenever
he
finds
that
the
feeling
he
is
studying
contemplates
what
he
himself
regards
as
a
reality
he
must
of
course
admit
the
feeling
itself
to
be
truly
cognitive
we
are
ourselves
the
critics
here
and
we
shall
find
our
burden
much
lightened
by
being
allowed
to
take
reality
in
this
relative
and
provisional
way
every
science
must
make
some
assumptions
erkenntnisstheoretiker
are
but
fallible
mortals
when
they
study
the
function
of
cognition
they
do
it
by
means
of
the
same
function
in
themselves
and
knowing
that
the
fountain
can
not
go
higher
than
its
source
we
should
promptly
confess
that
our
results
in
this
field
are
affected
by
our
own
liability
to
err
the
most
we
can
claim
is
that
what
we
say
about
cognition
may
be
counted
as
true
as
what
we
say
about
anything
else
if
our
hearers
agree
with
us
about
what
are
to
be
held
they
will
perhaps
also
agree
to
the
reality
of
our
doctrine
of
the
way
in
which
they
are
known
we
can
not
ask
for
more
our
terminology
shall
follow
the
spirit
of
these
remarks
we
will
deny
the
function
of
knowledge
to
any
feeling
whose
quality
or
content
we
do
not
ourselves
believe
to
exist
outside
of
that
feeling
as
well
as
in
it
we
may
call
such
a
feeling
a
dream
if
we
like
we
shall
have
to
see
later
whether
we
can
call
it
a
fiction
or
an
error
to
revert
now
to
our
thesis
some
persons
will
immediately
cry
out
can
a
reality
resemble
a
feeling
here
we
find
how
wise
we
were
to
name
the
quality
of
the
feeling
by
an
algebraic
letter
q
we
flank
the
whole
difficulty
of
resemblance
between
an
inner
state
and
an
outward
reality
by
leaving
it
free
to
any
one
to
postulate
as
the
reality
whatever
sort
of
thing
he
thinks
can
resemble
a
feeling
if
not
an
outward
thing
then
another
feeling
like
the
first
one
the
mere
feeling
q
in
the
critic
mind
for
example
evading
thus
this
objection
we
turn
to
another
which
is
sure
to
be
urged
it
will
come
from
those
philosophers
to
whom
in
the
sense
of
a
knowledge
of
relations
is
the
all
in
all
of
mental
life
and
who
hold
a
merely
feeling
consciousness
to
be
no
better
one
would
sometimes
say
from
their
utterances
a
good
deal
worse
than
no
consciousness
at
all
such
phrases
as
these
for
example
are
common
in
the
mouths
of
those
who
claim
to
walk
in
the
footprints
of
kant
and
hegel
rather
than
in
the
ancestral
english
paths
perception
detached
from
all
others
left
out
of
the
heap
we
call
a
mind
being
out
of
all
relation
has
no
qualities
is
simply
nothing
we
can
no
more
consider
it
than
we
can
see
vacancy
is
simply
in
itself
fleeting
momentary
unnameable
because
while
we
name
it
it
has
become
another
and
for
the
very
same
reason
unknowable
the
very
negation
of
knowability
from
what
we
have
considered
real
all
qualities
constituted
by
relation
we
find
that
none
are
left
altho
such
citations
as
these
from
the
writings
of
professor
green
might
be
multiplied
almost
indefinitely
they
would
hardly
repay
the
pains
of
collection
so
egregiously
false
is
the
doctrine
they
teach
our
little
supposed
feeling
whatever
it
may
be
from
the
cognitive
point
of
view
whether
a
bit
of
knowledge
or
a
dream
is
certainly
no
psychical
zero
it
is
a
most
positively
and
definitely
qualified
inner
fact
with
a
complexion
all
its
own
of
course
there
are
many
mental
facts
which
it
is
not
it
knows
q
if
q
be
a
reality
with
a
very
minimum
of
knowledge
it
neither
dates
nor
locates
it
it
neither
classes
nor
names
it
and
it
neither
knows
itself
as
a
feeling
nor
contrasts
itself
with
other
feelings
nor
estimates
its
own
duration
or
intensity
it
is
in
short
if
there
is
no
more
of
it
than
this
a
most
dumb
and
helpless
and
useless
kind
of
thing
but
if
we
must
describe
it
by
so
many
negations
and
if
it
can
say
nothing
about
itself
or
about
anything
else
by
what
right
do
we
deny
that
it
is
a
psychical
zero
and
may
not
the
be
right
after
all
in
the
innocent
looking
word
lies
the
solution
of
this
riddle
and
a
simple
enough
solution
it
is
when
frankly
looked
at
a
quotation
from
a
too
seldom
quoted
book
the
exploratio
philosophica
of
john
grote
london
will
form
the
best
introduction
to
it
knowledge
writes
grote
be
contemplated
in
either
of
two
ways
or
to
use
other
words
we
may
speak
in
a
double
manner
of
the
object
of
knowledge
that
is
we
may
either
use
language
thus
we
know
a
thing
a
man
etc
or
we
may
use
it
thus
we
know
such
and
such
things
about
the
thing
the
man
etc
language
in
general
following
its
true
logical
instinct
distinguishes
between
these
two
applications
of
the
notion
of
knowledge
the
one
being
yvwvai
noscere
kennen
connaitre
the
other
being
eidevai
scire
wissen
savoir
in
the
origin
the
former
may
be
considered
more
what
i
have
called
phenomenal
it
is
the
notion
of
knowledge
as
acquaintance
or
familiarity
with
what
is
known
which
notion
is
perhaps
more
akin
to
the
phenomenal
bodily
communication
and
is
less
purely
intellectual
than
the
other
it
is
the
kind
of
knowledge
which
we
have
of
a
thing
by
the
presentation
to
the
senses
or
the
representation
of
it
in
picture
or
type
a
vorstellung
the
other
which
is
what
we
express
in
judgments
or
propositions
what
is
embodied
in
begriffe
or
concepts
without
any
necessary
imaginative
representation
is
in
its
origin
the
more
intellectual
notion
of
knowledge
there
is
no
reason
however
why
we
should
not
express
our
knowledge
whatever
its
kind
in
either
manner
provided
only
we
do
not
confusedly
express
it
in
the
same
proposition
or
piece
of
reasoning
in
both
now
obviously
if
our
supposed
feeling
of
q
is
if
knowledge
at
all
only
knowledge
of
the
mere
it
is
milking
a
as
the
ancients
would
have
said
to
try
to
extract
from
it
any
deliverance
about
anything
under
the
sun
even
about
itself
and
it
is
as
unjust
after
our
failure
to
turn
upon
it
and
call
it
a
psychical
nothing
as
it
would
be
after
our
fruitless
attack
upon
the
to
proclaim
the
character
of
the
whole
but
the
entire
industry
of
the
hegelian
school
in
trying
to
shove
simple
sensation
out
of
the
pale
of
philosophic
recognition
is
founded
on
this
false
issue
it
is
always
the
of
sensation
its
inability
to
make
any
footnote
see
for
example
green
introduction
to
hume
treatise
of
human
nature
p
that
is
held
to
make
the
very
notion
of
it
meaningless
and
to
justify
the
student
of
knowledge
in
scouting
it
out
of
existence
in
the
sense
of
standing
as
the
sign
of
other
mental
states
is
taken
to
be
the
sole
function
of
what
mental
states
we
have
and
from
the
perception
that
our
little
primitive
sensation
has
as
yet
no
significance
in
this
literal
sense
it
is
an
easy
step
to
call
it
first
meaningless
next
senseless
then
vacuous
and
finally
to
brand
it
as
absurd
and
inadmissible
but
in
this
universal
liquidation
this
everlasting
slip
slip
slip
of
direct
acquaintance
into
until
at
last
nothing
is
left
about
which
the
knowledge
can
be
supposed
to
obtain
does
not
all
depart
from
the
situation
and
when
our
knowledge
about
things
has
reached
its
never
so
complicated
perfection
must
there
not
needs
abide
alongside
of
it
and
inextricably
mixed
in
with
it
some
acquaintance
with
what
things
all
this
knowledge
is
about
now
our
supposed
little
feeling
gives
a
what
and
if
other
feelings
should
succeed
which
remember
the
first
its
what
may
stand
as
subject
or
predicate
of
some
piece
of
of
some
judgment
perceiving
relations
between
it
and
other
whats
which
the
other
feelings
may
know
the
hitherto
dumb
q
will
then
receive
a
name
and
be
no
longer
speechless
but
every
name
as
students
of
logic
know
has
its
and
the
denotation
always
means
some
reality
or
content
relationless
as
extra
or
with
its
internal
relations
unanalyzed
like
the
q
which
our
primitive
sensation
is
supposed
to
know
no
proposition
is
possible
except
on
the
basis
of
a
preliminary
acquaintance
with
such
with
such
contents
as
this
let
the
q
be
fragrance
let
it
be
toothache
or
let
it
be
a
more
complex
kind
of
feeling
like
that
of
the
swimming
in
her
blue
abyss
it
must
first
come
in
that
simple
shape
and
be
held
fast
in
that
first
intention
before
any
knowledge
about
it
can
be
attained
the
knowledge
about
it
is
it
with
a
context
added
undo
it
and
what
is
added
can
not
be
context
footnote
if
a
enters
and
b
exclaims
you
see
my
brother
on
the
stairs
we
all
hold
that
a
may
answer
saw
him
but
did
know
he
was
your
brother
ignorance
of
brotherhood
not
abolishing
power
to
see
but
those
who
on
account
of
the
unrelatedness
of
the
first
facts
with
which
we
become
acquainted
deny
them
to
be
to
us
ought
in
consistency
to
maintain
that
if
a
did
not
perceive
the
relationship
of
the
man
on
the
stairs
to
b
it
was
impossible
he
should
have
noticed
him
at
all
let
us
say
no
more
then
about
this
objection
but
enlarge
our
thesis
thus
if
there
be
in
the
universe
a
q
other
than
the
q
in
the
feeling
the
latter
may
have
acquaintance
with
an
entity
ejective
to
itself
an
acquaintance
moreover
which
as
mere
acquaintance
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
susceptible
either
of
improvement
or
increase
being
in
its
way
complete
and
which
would
oblige
us
so
long
as
we
refuse
not
to
call
acquaintance
knowledge
to
say
not
only
that
the
feeling
is
cognitive
but
that
all
qualities
of
feeling
so
long
as
there
is
anything
outside
of
them
which
they
resemble
are
feelings
of
qualities
of
existence
and
perceptions
of
outward
fact
the
point
of
this
vindication
of
the
cognitive
function
of
the
first
feeling
lies
it
will
be
noticed
in
the
discovery
that
q
does
exist
elsewhere
than
in
it
in
case
this
discovery
were
not
made
we
could
not
be
sure
the
feeling
was
cognitive
and
in
case
there
were
nothing
outside
to
be
discovered
we
should
have
to
call
the
feeling
a
dream
but
the
feeling
itself
can
not
make
the
discovery
its
own
q
is
the
only
q
it
grasps
and
its
own
nature
is
not
a
particle
altered
by
having
the
function
of
cognition
either
added
to
it
or
taken
away
the
function
is
accidental
synthetic
not
analytic
and
falls
outside
and
not
inside
its
being
footnote
it
seems
odd
to
call
so
important
a
function
accidental
but
i
do
not
see
how
we
can
mend
the
matter
just
as
if
we
start
with
the
reality
and
ask
how
it
may
come
to
be
known
we
can
only
reply
by
invoking
a
feeling
which
shall
reconstruct
it
in
its
own
more
private
fashion
so
if
we
start
with
the
feeling
and
ask
how
it
may
come
to
know
we
can
only
reply
by
invoking
a
reality
which
shall
reconstruct
it
in
its
own
more
public
fashion
in
either
case
however
the
datum
we
start
with
remains
just
what
it
was
one
may
easily
get
lost
in
verbal
mysteries
about
the
difference
between
quality
of
feeling
and
feeling
of
quality
between
receiving
and
reconstructing
the
knowledge
of
a
reality
but
at
the
end
we
must
confess
that
the
notion
of
real
cognition
involves
an
unmediated
dualism
of
the
knower
and
the
known
see
bowne
metaphysics
new
york
pp
and
various
passages
in
lotze
logic
sec
is
a
bad
word
to
have
a
feeling
feels
as
a
gun
shoots
if
there
be
nothing
to
be
felt
or
hit
they
discharge
themselves
ins
blaue
hinein
if
however
something
starts
up
opposite
them
they
no
longer
simply
shoot
or
feel
they
hit
and
know
but
with
this
arises
a
worse
objection
than
any
yet
made
we
the
critics
look
on
and
see
a
real
q
and
a
feeling
of
q
and
because
the
two
resemble
each
other
we
say
the
one
knows
the
other
but
what
right
have
we
to
say
this
until
we
know
that
the
feeling
of
q
means
to
stand
for
or
represent
just
that
same
other
q
suppose
instead
of
one
q
a
number
of
real
q
in
the
field
if
the
gun
shoots
and
hits
we
can
easily
see
which
one
of
them
it
hits
but
how
can
we
distinguish
which
one
the
feeling
knows
it
knows
the
one
it
stands
for
but
which
one
does
it
stand
for
it
declares
no
intention
in
this
respect
it
merely
resembles
it
resembles
all
indifferently
and
resembling
per
se
is
not
necessarily
representing
or
at
all
eggs
resemble
each
other
but
do
not
on
that
account
represent
stand
for
or
know
each
other
and
if
you
say
this
is
because
neither
of
them
is
a
feeling
then
imagine
the
world
to
consist
of
nothing
but
toothaches
which
are
feelings
feelings
resembling
each
other
exactly
would
they
know
each
other
the
better
for
all
that
the
case
of
q
being
a
bare
quality
like
that
of
is
quite
different
from
that
of
its
being
a
concrete
individual
thing
there
is
practically
no
test
for
deciding
whether
the
feeling
of
a
bare
quality
means
to
represent
it
or
not
it
can
do
nothing
to
the
quality
beyond
resembling
it
simply
because
an
abstract
quality
is
a
thing
to
which
nothing
can
be
done
being
without
context
or
environment
or
principium
individuationis
a
quiddity
with
no
haecceity
a
platonic
idea
even
duplicate
editions
of
such
a
quality
were
they
possible
would
be
indiscernible
and
no
sign
could
be
given
no
result
altered
whether
the
feeling
i
meant
to
stand
for
this
edition
or
for
that
or
whether
it
simply
resembled
the
quality
without
meaning
to
stand
for
it
at
all
if
now
we
grant
a
genuine
pluralism
of
editions
to
the
quality
q
by
assigning
to
each
a
context
which
shall
distinguish
it
from
its
mates
we
may
proceed
to
explain
which
edition
of
it
the
feeling
knows
by
extending
our
principle
of
resemblance
to
the
context
too
and
saying
the
feeling
knows
the
particular
q
whose
context
it
most
exactly
duplicates
but
here
again
the
theoretic
doubt
recurs
duplication
and
coincidence
are
they
knowledge
the
gun
shows
which
q
it
points
to
and
hits
by
breaking
it
until
the
feeling
can
show
us
which
q
it
points
to
and
knows
by
some
equally
flagrant
token
why
are
we
not
free
to
deny
that
it
either
points
to
or
knows
any
one
of
the
real
q
at
all
and
to
affirm
that
the
word
exhaustively
describes
its
relation
to
the
reality
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
every
actual
feeling
does
show
us
quite
as
flagrantly
as
the
gun
which
q
it
points
to
and
practically
in
concrete
cases
the
matter
is
decided
by
an
element
we
have
hitherto
left
out
let
us
pass
from
abstractions
to
possible
instances
and
ask
our
obliging
deus
ex
machina
to
frame
for
us
a
richer
world
let
him
send
me
for
example
a
dream
of
the
death
of
a
certain
man
and
let
him
simultaneously
cause
the
man
to
die
how
would
our
practical
instinct
spontaneously
decide
whether
this
were
a
case
of
cognition
of
the
reality
or
only
a
sort
of
marvellous
coincidence
of
a
resembling
reality
with
my
dream
just
such
puzzling
cases
as
this
are
what
the
for
psychical
research
is
busily
collecting
and
trying
to
interpret
in
the
most
reasonable
way
if
my
dream
were
the
only
one
of
the
kind
i
ever
had
in
my
life
if
the
context
of
the
death
in
the
dream
differed
in
many
particulars
from
the
real
death
context
and
if
my
dream
led
me
to
no
action
about
the
death
unquestionably
we
should
all
call
it
a
strange
coincidence
and
naught
besides
but
if
the
death
in
the
dream
had
a
long
context
agreeing
point
for
point
with
every
feature
that
attended
the
real
death
if
i
were
constantly
having
such
dreams
all
equally
perfect
and
if
on
awaking
i
had
a
habit
of
acting
immediately
as
if
they
were
true
and
so
getting
start
of
my
more
tardily
instructed
neighbors
we
should
in
all
probability
have
to
admit
that
i
had
some
mysterious
kind
of
clairvoyant
power
that
my
dreams
in
an
inscrutable
way
meant
just
those
realities
they
figured
and
that
the
word
failed
to
touch
the
root
of
the
matter
and
whatever
doubts
any
one
preserved
would
completely
vanish
if
it
should
appear
that
from
the
midst
of
my
dream
i
had
the
power
of
interfering
with
the
course
of
the
reality
and
making
the
events
in
it
turn
this
way
or
that
according
as
i
dreamed
they
should
then
at
least
it
would
be
certain
that
my
waking
critics
and
my
dreaming
self
were
dealing
with
the
same
and
thus
do
men
invariably
decide
such
a
question
the
falling
of
the
dream
practical
consequences
into
the
real
world
and
the
extent
of
the
resemblance
between
the
two
worlds
are
the
criteria
they
instinctively
use
footnote
the
thoroughgoing
objector
might
it
is
true
still
return
to
the
charge
and
granting
a
dream
which
should
completely
mirror
the
real
universe
and
all
the
actions
dreamed
in
which
should
be
instantly
matched
by
duplicate
actions
in
this
universe
still
insist
that
this
is
nothing
more
than
harmony
and
that
it
is
as
far
as
ever
from
being
made
clear
whether
the
refers
to
that
other
world
all
of
whose
details
it
so
closely
copies
this
objection
leads
deep
into
metaphysics
i
do
not
impugn
its
importance
and
justice
obliges
me
to
say
that
but
for
the
teachings
of
my
colleague
josiah
royce
i
should
neither
have
grasped
its
full
force
nor
made
my
own
practical
and
psychological
point
of
view
as
clear
to
myself
as
it
is
on
this
occasion
i
prefer
to
stick
steadfastly
to
that
point
of
view
but
i
hope
that
royce
more
fundamental
criticism
of
the
function
of
cognition
may
ere
long
see
the
light
i
referred
in
this
note
to
royce
religious
aspect
of
philosophy
then
about
to
be
published
this
powerful
book
maintained
that
the
notion
of
referring
involved
that
of
an
inclusive
mind
that
shall
own
both
the
real
q
and
the
mental
q
and
use
the
latter
expressly
as
a
representative
symbol
of
the
former
at
the
time
i
could
not
refute
this
transcendentalist
opinion
later
largely
through
the
influence
of
professor
miller
see
his
essay
meaning
of
truth
and
error
in
the
philosophical
review
for
vol
i
came
to
see
that
any
definitely
experienceable
workings
would
serve
as
intermediaries
quite
as
well
as
the
absolute
intentions
would
all
feeling
is
for
the
sake
of
action
all
feeling
results
in
action
no
argument
is
needed
to
prove
these
truths
but
by
a
most
singular
disposition
of
nature
which
we
may
conceive
to
have
been
different
my
feelings
act
upon
the
realities
within
my
critic
world
unless
then
my
critic
can
prove
that
my
feeling
does
not
to
those
realities
which
it
acts
upon
how
can
he
continue
to
doubt
that
he
and
i
are
alike
cognizant
of
one
and
the
same
real
world
if
the
action
is
performed
in
one
world
that
must
be
the
world
the
feeling
intends
if
in
another
world
that
is
the
world
the
feeling
has
in
mind
if
your
feeling
bear
no
fruits
in
my
world
i
call
it
utterly
detached
from
my
world
i
call
it
a
solipsism
and
call
its
world
a
if
your
toothache
do
not
prompt
you
to
act
as
if
i
had
a
toothache
nor
even
as
if
i
had
a
separate
existence
if
you
neither
say
to
me
know
now
how
you
must
suffer
nor
tell
me
of
a
remedy
i
deny
that
your
feeling
however
it
may
resemble
mine
is
really
cognizant
of
mine
it
gives
no
sign
of
being
cognizant
and
such
a
sign
is
absolutely
necessary
to
my
admission
that
it
is
before
i
can
think
you
to
mean
my
world
you
must
affect
my
world
before
i
can
think
you
to
mean
much
of
it
you
must
affect
much
of
it
and
before
i
can
be
sure
you
mean
it
as
i
do
you
must
affect
it
just
as
i
should
if
i
were
in
your
place
then
i
your
critic
will
gladly
believe
that
we
are
thinking
not
only
of
the
same
reality
but
that
we
are
thinking
it
alike
and
thinking
of
much
of
its
extent
without
the
practical
effects
of
our
neighbor
feelings
on
our
own
world
we
should
never
suspect
the
existence
of
our
neighbor
feelings
at
all
and
of
course
should
never
find
ourselves
playing
the
critic
as
we
do
in
this
article
the
constitution
of
nature
is
very
peculiar
in
the
world
of
each
of
us
are
certain
objects
called
human
bodies
which
move
about
and
act
on
all
the
other
objects
there
and
the
occasions
of
their
action
are
in
the
main
what
the
occasions
of
our
action
would
be
were
they
our
bodies
they
use
words
and
gestures
which
if
we
used
them
would
have
thoughts
behind
them
no
mere
thoughts
uberhaupt
however
but
strictly
determinate
thoughts
i
think
you
have
the
notion
of
fire
in
general
because
i
see
you
act
towards
this
fire
in
my
room
just
as
i
act
towards
it
poke
it
and
present
your
person
towards
it
and
so
forth
but
that
binds
me
to
believe
that
if
you
feel
at
all
this
is
the
fire
you
feel
as
a
matter
of
fact
whenever
we
constitute
ourselves
into
psychological
critics
it
is
not
by
dint
of
discovering
which
reality
a
feeling
that
we
find
out
which
reality
it
means
we
become
first
aware
of
which
one
it
means
and
then
we
suppose
that
to
be
the
one
it
resembles
we
see
each
other
looking
at
the
same
objects
pointing
to
them
and
turning
them
over
in
various
ways
and
thereupon
we
hope
and
trust
that
all
of
our
several
feelings
resemble
the
reality
and
each
other
but
this
is
a
thing
of
which
we
are
never
theoretically
sure
still
it
would
practically
be
a
case
of
grubelsucht
if
a
ruffian
were
assaulting
and
drubbing
my
body
to
spend
much
time
in
subtle
speculation
either
as
to
whether
his
vision
of
my
body
resembled
mine
or
as
to
whether
the
body
he
really
meant
to
insult
were
not
some
body
in
his
mind
eye
altogether
other
from
my
own
the
practical
point
of
view
brushes
such
metaphysical
cobwebs
away
if
what
he
have
in
mind
be
not
my
body
why
call
we
it
a
body
at
all
his
mind
is
inferred
by
me
as
a
term
to
whose
existence
we
trace
the
things
that
happen
the
inference
is
quite
void
if
the
term
once
inferred
be
separated
from
its
connection
with
the
body
that
made
me
infer
it
and
connected
with
another
that
is
not
mine
at
all
no
matter
for
the
metaphysical
puzzle
of
how
our
two
minds
the
ruffian
and
mine
can
mean
the
same
body
men
who
see
each
other
bodies
sharing
the
same
space
treading
the
same
earth
splashing
the
same
water
making
the
same
air
resonant
and
pursuing
the
same
game
and
eating
out
of
the
same
dish
will
never
practically
believe
in
a
pluralism
of
solipsistic
worlds
where
however
the
actions
of
one
mind
seem
to
take
no
effect
in
the
world
of
the
other
the
case
is
different
this
is
what
happens
in
poetry
and
fiction
every
one
knows
ivanhoe
for
example
but
so
long
as
we
stick
to
the
story
pure
and
simple
without
regard
to
the
facts
of
its
production
few
would
hesitate
to
admit
that
there
are
as
many
different
ivanhoes
as
there
are
different
minds
cognizant
of
the
story
footnote
that
is
there
is
no
real
not
even
the
one
in
sir
walter
scott
mind
as
he
was
writing
the
story
that
one
is
only
the
first
one
of
the
it
is
quite
true
we
can
make
it
the
real
ivanhoe
if
we
like
and
then
say
that
the
other
ivanhoes
know
it
or
do
not
know
it
according
as
they
refer
to
and
resemble
it
or
no
this
is
done
by
bringing
in
sir
walter
scott
himself
as
the
author
of
the
real
ivanhoe
and
so
making
a
complex
object
of
both
this
object
however
is
not
a
story
pure
and
simple
it
has
dynamic
relations
with
the
world
common
to
the
experience
of
all
the
readers
sir
walter
scott
ivanhoe
got
itself
printed
in
volumes
which
we
all
can
handle
and
to
any
one
of
which
we
can
refer
to
see
which
of
our
versions
be
the
true
one
the
original
one
of
scott
himself
we
can
see
the
manuscript
in
short
we
can
get
back
to
the
ivanhoe
in
scott
mind
by
many
an
avenue
and
channel
of
this
real
world
of
our
experience
a
thing
we
can
by
no
means
do
with
either
the
ivanhoe
or
the
rebecca
either
the
templar
or
the
isaac
of
york
of
the
story
taken
simply
as
such
and
detached
from
the
conditions
of
its
production
everywhere
then
we
have
the
same
test
can
we
pass
continuously
from
two
objects
in
two
minds
to
a
third
object
which
seems
to
be
in
both
minds
because
each
mind
feels
every
modification
imprinted
on
it
by
the
other
if
so
the
first
two
objects
named
are
derivatives
to
say
the
least
from
the
same
third
object
and
may
be
held
if
they
resemble
each
other
to
refer
to
one
and
the
same
reality
the
fact
that
all
these
ivanhoes
resemble
each
other
does
not
prove
the
contrary
but
if
an
alteration
invented
by
one
man
in
his
version
were
to
reverberate
immediately
through
all
the
other
versions
and
produce
changes
therein
we
should
then
easily
agree
that
all
these
thinkers
were
thinking
the
same
ivanhoe
and
that
fiction
or
no
fiction
it
formed
a
little
world
common
to
them
all
having
reached
this
point
we
may
take
up
our
thesis
and
improve
it
again
still
calling
the
reality
by
the
name
of
q
and
letting
the
critic
feeling
vouch
for
it
we
can
say
that
any
other
feeling
will
be
held
cognizant
of
q
provided
it
both
resemble
q
and
refer
to
q
as
shown
by
its
either
modifying
q
directly
or
modifying
some
other
reality
p
or
r
which
the
critic
knows
to
be
continuous
with
q
or
more
shortly
thus
the
feeling
of
q
knows
whatever
reality
it
resembles
and
either
directly
or
indirectly
operates
on
if
it
resemble
without
operating
it
is
a
dream
if
it
operate
without
resembling
it
is
an
error
footnote
among
such
errors
are
those
cases
in
which
our
feeling
operates
on
a
reality
which
it
does
partially
resemble
and
yet
does
not
intend
as
for
instance
when
i
take
up
your
umbrella
meaning
to
take
my
own
i
can
not
be
said
here
either
to
know
your
umbrella
or
my
own
which
latter
my
feeling
more
completely
resembles
i
am
mistaking
them
both
misrepresenting
their
context
etc
we
have
spoken
in
the
text
as
if
the
critic
were
necessarily
one
mind
and
the
feeling
criticised
another
but
the
criticised
feeling
and
its
critic
may
be
earlier
and
later
feelings
of
the
same
mind
and
here
it
might
seem
that
we
could
dispense
with
the
notion
of
operating
to
prove
that
critic
and
criticised
are
referring
to
and
meaning
to
represent
the
same
we
think
we
see
our
past
feelings
directly
and
know
what
they
refer
to
without
appeal
at
the
worst
we
can
always
fix
the
intention
of
our
present
feeling
and
make
it
refer
to
the
same
reality
to
which
any
one
of
our
past
feelings
may
have
referred
so
we
need
no
here
to
make
sure
that
the
feeling
and
its
critic
mean
the
same
real
q
well
all
the
better
if
this
is
so
we
have
covered
the
more
complex
and
difficult
case
in
our
text
and
we
may
let
this
easier
one
go
the
main
thing
at
present
is
to
stick
to
practical
psychology
and
ignore
metaphysical
difficulties
one
more
remark
our
formula
contains
it
will
be
observed
nothing
to
correspond
to
the
great
principle
of
cognition
laid
down
by
professor
ferrier
in
his
institutes
of
metaphysic
and
apparently
adopted
by
all
the
followers
of
fichte
the
principle
namely
that
for
knowledge
to
be
constituted
there
must
be
knowledge
of
the
knowing
mind
along
with
whatever
else
is
known
not
q
as
we
have
supposed
but
q
plus
myself
must
be
the
least
i
can
know
it
is
certain
that
the
common
sense
of
mankind
never
dreams
of
using
any
such
principle
when
it
tries
to
discriminate
between
conscious
states
that
are
knowledge
and
conscious
states
that
are
not
so
that
ferrier
principle
if
it
have
any
relevancy
at
all
must
have
relevancy
to
the
metaphysical
possibility
of
consciousness
at
large
and
not
to
the
practically
recognized
constitution
of
cognitive
consciousness
we
may
therefore
pass
it
by
without
further
notice
here
it
is
to
be
feared
that
the
reader
may
consider
this
formula
rather
insignificant
and
obvious
and
hardly
worth
the
labor
of
so
many
pages
especially
when
he
considers
that
the
only
cases
to
which
it
applies
are
percepts
and
that
the
whole
field
of
symbolic
or
conceptual
thinking
seems
to
elude
its
grasp
where
the
reality
is
either
a
material
thing
or
act
or
a
state
of
the
consciousness
i
may
both
mirror
it
in
my
mind
and
operate
upon
it
in
the
latter
case
indirectly
of
course
as
soon
as
i
perceive
it
but
there
are
many
cognitions
universally
allowed
to
be
such
which
neither
mirror
nor
operate
on
their
realities
in
the
whole
field
of
symbolic
thought
we
are
universally
held
both
to
intend
to
speak
of
and
to
reach
conclusions
about
to
know
in
short
particular
realities
without
having
in
our
subjective
consciousness
any
that
resembles
them
even
in
a
remote
degree
we
are
instructed
about
them
by
language
which
awakens
no
consciousness
beyond
its
sound
and
we
know
which
realities
they
are
by
the
faintest
and
most
fragmentary
glimpse
of
some
remote
context
they
may
have
and
by
no
direct
imagination
of
themselves
as
minds
may
differ
here
let
me
speak
in
the
first
person
i
am
sure
that
my
own
current
thinking
has
words
for
its
almost
exclusive
subjective
material
words
which
are
made
intelligible
by
being
referred
to
some
reality
that
lies
beyond
the
horizon
of
direct
consciousness
and
of
which
i
am
only
aware
as
of
a
terminal
more
existing
in
a
certain
direction
to
which
the
words
might
lead
but
do
not
lead
yet
the
subject
or
topic
of
the
words
is
usually
something
towards
which
i
mentally
seem
to
pitch
them
in
a
backward
way
almost
as
i
might
jerk
my
thumb
over
my
shoulder
to
point
at
something
without
looking
round
if
i
were
only
entirely
sure
that
it
was
there
the
upshot
or
conclusion
of
the
words
is
something
towards
which
i
seem
to
incline
my
head
forwards
as
if
giving
assent
to
its
existence
tho
all
my
mind
eye
catches
sight
of
may
be
some
tatter
of
an
image
connected
with
it
which
tatter
however
if
only
endued
with
the
feeling
of
familiarity
and
reality
makes
me
feel
that
the
whole
to
which
it
belongs
is
rational
and
real
and
fit
to
be
let
pass
here
then
is
cognitive
consciousness
on
a
large
scale
and
yet
what
it
knows
it
hardly
resembles
in
the
least
degree
the
formula
last
laid
down
for
our
thesis
must
therefore
be
made
more
complete
we
may
now
express
it
thus
a
percept
knows
whatever
reality
it
directly
or
indirectly
operates
on
and
resembles
aconceptual
feeling
or
thought
knows
a
reality
whenever
it
actually
or
potentially
terminates
in
a
percept
that
operates
on
or
resembles
that
reality
or
is
otherwise
connected
with
it
or
with
its
context
the
latter
percept
may
be
either
sensation
or
sensorial
idea
and
when
i
say
the
thought
must
terminate
in
such
a
percept
i
mean
that
it
must
ultimately
be
capable
of
leading
up
thereto
by
the
way
of
practical
missing
section
is
an
incomplete
about
that
reality
that
reality
is
its
etc
experience
if
the
terminal
feeling
be
a
sensation
by
the
way
of
logical
or
habitual
suggestion
if
it
be
only
an
image
in
the
mind
let
an
illustration
make
this
plainer
i
open
the
first
book
i
take
up
and
read
the
first
sentence
that
meets
my
eye
saw
the
handiwork
of
god
in
the
heavens
as
plainly
as
paley
in
the
animal
kingdom
i
immediately
look
back
and
try
to
analyze
the
subjective
state
in
which
i
rapidly
apprehended
this
sentence
as
i
read
it
in
the
first
place
there
was
an
obvious
feeling
that
the
sentence
was
intelligible
and
rational
and
related
to
the
world
of
realities
there
was
also
a
sense
of
agreement
or
harmony
between
and
there
was
no
apparent
image
connected
with
the
words
or
or
they
were
words
merely
with
kingdom
i
think
there
was
the
faintest
consciousness
it
may
possibly
have
been
an
image
of
the
steps
of
the
museum
of
zoology
in
the
town
of
cambridge
where
i
write
with
there
was
an
equally
faint
consciousness
of
a
small
dark
leather
book
and
with
a
pretty
distinct
vision
of
the
lower
corner
of
curling
periwig
this
is
all
the
i
can
discover
in
my
first
consciousness
of
the
meaning
of
this
sentence
and
i
am
afraid
that
even
not
all
of
this
would
have
been
present
had
i
come
upon
the
sentence
in
a
genuine
reading
of
the
book
and
not
picked
it
out
for
an
experiment
and
yet
my
consciousness
was
truly
cognitive
the
sentence
is
realities
which
my
psychological
critic
for
we
must
not
forget
him
acknowledges
to
be
such
even
as
he
acknowledges
my
distinct
feeling
that
they
are
realities
and
my
acquiescence
in
the
general
rightness
of
what
i
read
of
them
to
be
true
knowledge
on
my
part
now
what
justifies
my
critic
in
being
as
lenient
as
this
this
singularly
inadequate
consciousness
of
mine
made
up
of
symbols
that
neither
resemble
nor
affect
the
realities
they
stand
for
how
can
he
be
sure
it
is
cognizant
of
the
very
realities
he
has
himself
in
mind
he
is
sure
because
in
countless
like
cases
he
has
seen
such
inadequate
and
symbolic
thoughts
by
developing
themselves
terminate
in
percepts
that
practically
modified
and
presumably
resembled
his
own
by
themselves
is
meant
obeying
their
tendencies
following
up
the
suggestions
nascently
present
in
them
working
in
the
direction
in
which
they
seem
to
point
clearing
up
the
penumbra
making
distinct
the
halo
unravelling
the
fringe
which
is
part
of
their
composition
and
in
the
midst
of
which
their
more
substantive
kernel
of
subjective
content
seems
consciously
to
lie
thus
i
may
develop
my
thought
in
the
paley
direction
by
procuring
the
brown
leather
volume
and
bringing
the
passages
about
the
animal
kingdom
before
the
critic
eyes
i
may
satisfy
him
that
the
words
mean
for
me
just
what
they
mean
for
him
by
showing
him
in
concreto
the
very
animals
and
their
arrangements
of
which
the
pages
treat
i
may
get
newton
works
and
portraits
or
if
i
follow
the
line
of
suggestion
of
the
wig
i
may
smother
my
critic
in
matters
pertaining
to
newton
environment
to
show
that
the
word
has
the
same
locus
and
relations
in
both
our
minds
finally
i
may
by
act
and
word
persuade
him
that
what
i
mean
by
god
and
the
heavens
and
the
analogy
of
the
handiworks
is
just
what
he
means
also
my
demonstration
in
the
last
resort
is
to
his
senses
my
thought
makes
me
act
on
his
senses
much
as
he
might
himself
act
on
them
were
he
pursuing
the
consequences
of
a
perception
of
his
own
practically
then
my
thought
terminates
in
his
realities
he
willingly
supposes
it
therefore
to
be
of
them
and
inwardly
to
resemble
what
his
own
thought
would
be
were
it
of
the
same
symbolic
sort
as
mine
and
the
pivot
and
fulcrum
and
support
of
his
mental
persuasion
is
the
sensible
operation
which
my
thought
leads
me
or
may
lead
to
effect
the
bringing
of
paley
book
of
newton
portrait
before
his
very
eyes
in
the
last
analysis
then
we
believe
that
we
all
know
and
think
about
and
talk
about
the
same
world
because
we
believe
our
percepts
are
possessed
by
us
in
common
and
we
believe
this
because
the
percepts
of
each
one
of
us
seem
to
be
changed
in
consequence
of
changes
in
the
percepts
of
someone
else
what
i
am
for
you
is
in
the
first
instance
a
percept
of
your
own
unexpectedly
however
i
open
and
show
you
a
book
uttering
certain
sounds
the
while
these
acts
are
also
your
percepts
but
they
so
resemble
acts
of
yours
with
feelings
prompting
them
that
you
can
not
doubt
i
have
the
feelings
too
or
that
the
book
is
one
book
felt
in
both
our
worlds
that
it
is
felt
in
the
same
way
that
my
feelings
of
it
resemble
yours
is
something
of
which
we
never
can
be
sure
but
which
we
assume
as
the
simplest
hypothesis
that
meets
the
case
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
never
are
sure
of
it
and
as
erkenntnisstheoretiker
we
can
only
say
that
of
feelings
that
should
not
resemble
each
other
both
could
not
know
the
same
thing
at
the
same
time
in
the
same
way
footnote
though
both
might
terminate
in
the
same
thing
and
be
incomplete
thoughts
it
if
each
holds
to
its
own
percept
as
the
reality
it
is
bound
to
say
of
the
other
percept
that
though
it
may
intend
that
reality
and
prove
this
by
working
change
upon
it
yet
if
it
do
not
resemble
it
it
is
all
false
and
wrong
footnote
the
difference
between
idealism
and
realism
is
immaterial
here
what
is
said
in
the
text
is
consistent
with
either
theory
a
law
by
which
my
percept
shall
change
yours
directly
is
no
more
mysterious
than
a
law
by
which
it
shall
first
change
a
physical
reality
and
then
the
reality
change
yours
in
either
case
you
and
i
seem
knit
into
a
continuous
world
and
not
to
form
a
pair
of
solipsisms
if
this
be
so
of
percepts
how
much
more
so
of
higher
modes
of
thought
even
in
the
sphere
of
sensation
individuals
are
probably
different
enough
comparative
study
of
the
simplest
conceptual
elements
seems
to
show
a
wider
divergence
still
and
when
it
comes
to
general
theories
and
emotional
attitudes
towards
life
it
is
indeed
time
to
say
with
thackeray
friend
two
different
universes
walk
about
under
your
hat
and
under
mine
what
can
save
us
at
all
and
prevent
us
from
flying
asunder
into
a
chaos
of
mutually
repellent
solipsisms
through
what
can
our
several
minds
commune
through
nothing
but
the
mutual
resemblance
of
those
of
our
perceptual
feelings
which
have
this
power
of
modifying
one
another
which
are
mere
dumb
and
which
must
also
resemble
their
realities
or
not
know
them
aright
at
all
in
such
pieces
of
all
our
must
end
and
carry
a
sense
of
this
possible
termination
as
part
of
its
content
these
percepts
these
termini
these
sensible
things
these
mere
are
the
only
realities
we
ever
directly
know
and
the
whole
history
of
our
thought
is
the
history
of
our
substitution
of
one
of
them
for
another
and
the
reduction
of
the
substitute
to
the
status
of
a
conceptual
sign
contemned
though
they
be
by
some
thinkers
these
sensations
are
the
the
anchorage
the
stable
rock
the
first
and
last
limits
the
terminus
a
quo

much
came

find
distinctly
asserted

through

the

resembling

processes
varying
with

the
defects
in

account
are
the
possibly
undue
prominence
given
to
resembling
which
altho
a
fundamental
function
in
knowing
truly
is
so
often
dispensed
with
the
undue
emphasis
laid
upon
operating
on
the
object
itself
which
in
many
cases
is
indeed
decisive
of
that
being
what
we
refer
to
but
which
is
often
lacking
or
replaced
by
operations
on
other
things
related
to
the
object
the
imperfect
development
of
the
generalized
notion
of
the
workability
of
the
feeling
or
idea
as
equivalent
to
that
satisfactory
adaptation
to
the
particular
reality
which
constitutes
the
truth
of
the
idea
it
is
this
more
generalized
notion

covering
all
such

there
are
two
ways
of

knowing

conceptually

representatively
altho
such
things
as
the
white
paper
before
our

can
be
known
intuitively
most
of
the
things
we
know
the
tigers
now
in

for
example
or
the
scholastic
system
of
philosophy
are
known
only
representatively
or
symbolically
suppose
to
fix
our
ideas
that
we
take
first
a
case
of
conceptual
knowledge
and
let
it
be
our
knowledge
of
the
tigers
in
india
as
we
sit
here
exactly
what
do
we
mean
by
saying
that
we
here
know
the
tigers
what
is
the
precise
fact
that
the
cognition
so
confidently
claimed
is
to
use
shadworth
hodgson
inelegant
but
valuable
form
of
words
most
men
would
answer
that
what
we
mean
by
knowing
the
tigers
is
having
them
however
absent
in
body
become
in
some
way
present
to
our
thought
or
that
our
knowledge
of
them
is
known
as
presence
of
our
thought
to
them
a
great
mystery
is
usually
made
of
this
peculiar
presence
in
absence
and
the
scholastic
philosophy
which
is
only
common
sense
grown
pedantic
would
explain
it
as
a
peculiar
kind
of
existence
called
intentional
existence
of
the
tigers
in
our
mind
at
the
very
least
people
would
say
that
what
we
mean
by
knowing
the
tigers
is
mentally
pointing
towards
them
as
we
sit
here
but
now
what
do
we
mean
by
pointing
in
such
a
case
as
this
what
is
the
pointing
here
to
this
question
i
shall
have
to
give
a
very
prosaic
answer
one
that
traverses
the
not
only
of
common
sense
and
scholasticism
but
also
those
of
nearly
all
the
epistemological
writers
whom
i
have
ever
read
the
answer
made
brief
is
this
the
pointing
of
our
thought
to
the
tigers
is
known
simply
and
solely
as
a
procession
of
mental
associates
and
motor
consequences
that
follow
on
the
thought
and
that
would
lead
harmoniously
if
followed
out
into
some
ideal
or
real
context
or
even
into
the
immediate
presence
of
the
tigers
it
is
known
as
our
rejection
of
a
jaguar
if
that
beast
were
shown
us
as
a
tiger
as
our
assent
to
a
genuine
tiger
if
so
shown
it
is
known
as
our
ability
to
utter
all
sorts
of
propositions
which
do
contradict
other
propositions
that
are
true
of
the
real
tigers
it
is
even
known
if
we
take
the
tigers
very
seriously
as
actions
of
ours
which
may
terminate
in
directly
intuited
tigers
as
they
would
if
we
took
a
voyage
to
india
for
the
purpose
of
and
brought
back
a
lot
of
skins
of
the
striped
rascals
which
we
had
laid
low
in
all
this
there
is
no
in
our
mental
images
taken
by
themselves
they
are
one
phenomenal
fact
the
tigers
are
another
and
their
pointing
to
the
tigers
is
a
perfectly
commonplace
relation
if
you
once
grant
a
connecting
world
to
be
there
in
short
the
ideas
and
the
tigers
are
in
themselves
as
loose
and
separate
to
use
hume
language
as
any
two
things
can
be
and
pointing
means
here
an
operation
as
external
and
adventitious
as
any
that
nature
yields
footnote
a
stone
in
one
field
may
we
say
a
hole
in
another
field
but
the
relation
of
so
long
as
no
one
carries
the
stone
to
the
hole
and
drops
it
in
is
only
one
name
for
the
fact
that
such
an
act
may
happen
similarly
with
the
knowing
of
the
tigers
here
and
now
it
is
only
an
anticipatory
name
for
a
further
associative
and
terminative
process
that
may
occur
i
hope
you
may
agree
with
me
now
that
in
representative
knowledge
there
is
no
special
inner
mystery
but
only
an
outer
chain
of
physical
or
mental
intermediaries
connecting
thought
and
thing
to
know
an
object
is
here
to
lead
to
it
through
a
context
which
the
world
supplies
all
this
was
most
instructively
set
forth
by
our
colleague
miller
at
our
meeting
in
new
york
last
christmas
and
for
my
sometime
wavering
opinion
i
owe
him
this
acknowledgment
footnote
see
miller
articles
on
truth
and
error
and
on
content
and
function
in
the
philosophical
review
july
and
let
us
next
pass
on
to
the
case
of
immediate
or
intuitive
acquaintance
with
an
object
and
let
the
object
be
the
white
paper
before
our
eyes
the
and
the
are
here
indistinguishably
the
same
in
nature
as
we
saw
a
moment
since
and
there
is
no
context
of
intermediaries
or
associates
to
stand
between
and
separate
the
thought
and
thing
there
is
no
in
absence
here
and
no
but
rather
an
allround
embracing
of
the
paper
by
the
thought
and
it
is
clear
that
the
knowing
can
not
now
be
explained
exactly
as
it
was
when
the
tigers
were
its
object
dotted
all
through
our
experience
are
states
of
immediate
acquaintance
just
like
this
somewhere
our
belief
always
does
rest
on
ultimate
data
like
the
whiteness
smoothness
or
squareness
of
this
paper
whether
such
qualities
be
truly
ultimate
aspects
of
being
or
only
provisional
suppositions
of
ours
till
we
get
better
informed
is
quite
immaterial
for
our
present
inquiry
so
long
as
it
is
believed
in
we
see
our
object
face
to
face
what
now
do
we
mean
by
such
a
sort
of
object
as
this
for
this
is
also
the
way
in
which
we
should
know
the
tiger
if
our
conceptual
idea
of
him
were
to
terminate
by
having
led
us
to
his
lair
this
address
must
not
become
too
long
so
i
must
give
my
answer
in
the
fewest
words
and
let
me
first
say
this
so
far
as
the
white
paper
or
other
ultimate
datum
of
our
experience
is
considered
to
enter
also
into
some
one
else
experience
and
we
in
knowing
it
are
held
to
know
it
there
as
well
as
here
so
far
again
as
it
is
considered
to
be
a
mere
mask
for
hidden
molecules
that
other
now
impossible
experiences
of
our
own
might
some
day
lay
bare
to
view
so
far
it
is
a
case
of
tigers
in
india
again
the
things
known
being
absent
experiences
the
knowing
can
only
consist
in
passing
smoothly
towards
them
through
the
intermediary
context
that
the
world
supplies
but
if
our
own
private
vision
of
the
paper
be
considered
in
abstraction
from
every
other
event
as
if
it
constituted
by
itself
the
universe
and
it
might
perfectly
well
do
so
for
aught
we
can
understand
to
the
contrary
then
the
paper
seen
and
the
seeing
of
it
are
only
two
names
for
one
indivisible
fact
which
properly
named
is
the
datum
the
phenomenon
or
the
experience
the
paper
is
in
the
mind
and
the
mind
is
around
the
paper
because
paper
and
mind
are
only
two
names
that
are
given
later
to
the
one
experience
when
taken
in
a
larger
world
of
which
it
forms
a
part
its
connections
are
traced
in
different
directions
footnote
what
is
meant
by
this
is
that
experience
can
be
referred
to
either
of
two
great
associative
systems
that
of
the
experiencer
mental
history
or
that
of
the
experienced
facts
of
the
world
of
both
of
these
systems
it
forms
part
and
may
be
regarded
indeed
as
one
of
their
points
of
intersection
one
might
let
a
vertical
line
stand
for
the
mental
history
but
the
same
object
o
appears
also
in
the
mental
history
of
different
persons
represented
by
the
other
vertical
lines
it
thus
ceases
to
be
the
private
property
of
one
experience
and
becomes
so
to
speak
a
shared
or
public
thing
we
can
track
its
outer
history
in
this
way
and
represent
it
by
the
horizontal
line
it
is
also
known
representatively
at
other
points
of
the
vertical
lines
or
intuitively
there
again
so
that
the
line
of
its
outer
history
would
have
to
be
looped
and
wandering
but
i
make
it
straight
for
simplicity
sake
in
any
case
however
it
is
the
same
stuff
figures
in
all
the
sets
of
lines
to
know
immediately
then
or
intuitively
is
for
mental
content
and
object
to
be
identical
this
is
a
very
different
definition
from
that
which
we
gave
of
representative
knowledge
but
neither
definition
involves
those
mysterious
notions
of
and
presence
in
absence
which
are
such
essential
parts
of
the
ideas
of
knowledge
both
of
philosophers
and
of
common
men

a
couple
of
interpolations
from

in

more
in

have
been
made
receiving
from
the
editor
of

an
advance
proof
of
article
on

i
understand
this
as
a
hint
to
me
to
join
in
the
controversy
over
which
seems
to
have
seriously
begun
as
my
name
has
been
coupled
with
the
movement
i
deem
it
wise
to
take
the
hint
the
more
so
as
in
some
quarters
greater
credit
has
been
given
me
than
i
deserve
and
probably
undeserved
discredit
in
other
quarters
falls
also
to
my
lot
first
as
to
the
word
i
myself
have
only
used
the
term
to
indicate
a
method
of
carrying
on
abstract
discussion
the
serious
meaning
of
a
concept
says
peirce
lies
in
the
concrete
difference
to
some
one
which
its
being
true
will
make
strive
to
bring
all
debated
conceptions
to
that
pragmatic
test
and
you
will
escape
vain
wrangling
if
it
can
make
no
practical
difference
which
of
two
statements
be
true
then
they
are
really
one
statement
in
two
verbal
forms
if
it
can
make
no
practical
difference
whether
a
given
statement
be
true
or
false
then
the
statement
has
no
real
meaning
in
neither
case
is
there
anything
fit
to
quarrel
about
we
may
save
our
breath
and
pass
to
more
important
things
all
that
the
pragmatic
method
implies
then
is
that
truths
should
have
practical
footnote
in
the
sense
of
particular
of
course
not
in
the
sense
that
the
consequences
may
not
be
mental
as
well
as
physical
consequences
in
england
the
word
has
been
used
more
broadly
still
to
cover
the
notion
that
the
truth
of
any
statement
consists
in
the
consequences
and
particularly
in
their
being
good
consequences
here
we
get
beyond
affairs
of
method
altogether
and
since
my
pragmatism
and
this
wider
pragmatism
are
so
different
and
both
are
important
enough
to
have
different
names
i
think
that
schiller
proposal
to
call
the
wider
pragmatism
by
the
name
of
is
excellent
and
ought
to
be
adopted
the
narrower
pragmatism
may
still
be
spoken
of
as
the
method
i
have
read
in
the
past
six
months
many
hostile
reviews
of
and
dewey
publications
but
with
the
exception
of
elaborate
indictment
they
are
out
of
reach
where
i
write
and
i
have
largely
forgotten
them
i
think
that
a
free
discussion
of
the
subject
on
my
part
would
in
any
case
be
more
useful
than
a
polemic
attempt
at
rebutting
these
criticisms
in
detail
bradley
in
particular
can
be
taken
care
of
by
schiller
he
repeatedly
confesses
himself
unable
to
comprehend
schiller
views
he
evidently
has
not
sought
to
do
so
sympathetically
and
i
deeply
regret
to
say
that
his
laborious
article
throws
for
my
mind
absolutely
no
useful
light
upon
the
subject
it
seems
to
me
on
the
whole
an
ignoratio
elenchi
and
i
feel
free
to
disregard
it
altogether
the
subject
is
unquestionably
difficult
dewey
and
thought
is
eminently
an
induction
a
generalization
working
itself
free
from
all
sorts
of
entangling
particulars
if
true
it
involves
much
restatement
of
traditional
notions
this
is
a
kind
of
intellectual
product
that
never
attains
a
classic
form
of
expression
when
first
promulgated
the
critic
ought
therefore
not
to
be
too
sharp
and
in
his
dealings
with
it
but
should
weigh
it
as
a
whole
and
especially
weigh
it
against
its
possible
alternatives
one
should
also
try
to
apply
it
first
to
one
instance
and
then
to
another
to
see
how
it
will
work
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
emphatically
not
a
case
for
instant
execution
by
conviction
of
intrinsic
absurdity
or
of
or
by
caricature
of
what
it
would
look
like
if
reduced
to
skeleton
shape
humanism
is
in
fact
much
more
like
one
of
those
secular
changes
that
come
upon
public
opinion
overnight
as
it
were
borne
upon
tides
deep
for
sound
or
foam
that
survive
all
the
crudities
and
extravagances
of
their
advocates
that
you
can
pin
to
no
one
absolutely
essential
statement
nor
kill
by
any
one
decisive
stab
such
have
been
the
changes
from
aristocracy
to
democracy
from
classic
to
romantic
taste
from
theistic
to
pantheistic
feeling
from
static
to
evolutionary
ways
of
understanding
life
changes
of
which
we
all
have
been
spectators
scholasticism
still
opposes
to
such
changes
the
method
of
confutation
by
single
decisive
reasons
showing
that
the
new
view
involves
or
traverses
some
fundamental
principle
this
is
like
stopping
a
river
by
planting
a
stick
in
the
middle
of
its
bed
round
your
obstacle
flows
the
water
and
there
all
the
same
in
reading
some
of
our
opponents
i
am
not
a
little
reminded
of
those
catholic
writers
who
refute
darwinism
by
telling
us
that
higher
species
can
not
come
from
lower
because
minus
nequit
gignere
plus
or
that
the
notion
of
transformation
is
absurd
for
it
implies
that
species
tend
to
their
own
destruction
and
that
would
violate
the
principle
that
every
reality
tends
to
persevere
in
its
own
shape
the
point
of
view
is
too
myopic
too
tight
and
close
to
take
in
the
inductive
argument
wide
generalizations
in
science
always
meet
with
these
summary
refutations
in
their
early
days
but
they
outlive
them
and
the
refutations
then
sound
oddly
antiquated
and
scholastic
i
can
not
help
suspecting
that
the
humanistic
theory
is
going
through
this
kind
of
refutation
at
present
the
one
condition
of
understanding
humanism
is
to
become
oneself
to
drop
rigorous
definitions
and
follow
lines
of
least
resistance
the
whole
other
words
an
opponent
might
say
your
intellect
into
a
kind
of
slush
so
i
make
reply
you
will
consent
to
use
no
politer
word
for
humanism
conceiving
the
more
as
the
more
dewey
term
has
sincerely
to
renounce
rectilinear
arguments
and
ancient
ideals
of
rigor
and
finality
it
is
in
just
this
temper
of
renunciation
so
different
from
that
of
pyrrhonistic
scepticism
that
the
spirit
of
humanism
essentially
consists
satisfactoriness
has
to
be
measured
by
a
multitude
of
standards
of
which
some
for
aught
we
know
may
fail
in
any
given
case
and
what
is
more
satisfactory
than
any
alternative
in
sight
may
to
the
end
be
a
sum
of
pluses
and
minuses
concerning
which
we
can
only
trust
that
by
ulterior
corrections
and
improvements
a
maximum
of
the
one
and
a
minimum
of
the
other
may
some
day
be
approached
it
means
a
real
change
of
heart
a
break
with
absolutistic
hopes
when
one
takes
up
this
inductive
view
of
the
conditions
of
belief
as
i
understand
the
pragmatist
way
of
seeing
things
it
owes
its
being
to
the
which
the
last
fifty
years
have
brought
about
in
the
older
notions
of
scientific
truth
geometrizes
it
used
to
be
said
and
it
was
believed
that
euclid
elements
literally
reproduced
his
geometrizing
there
is
an
eternal
and
unchangeable
and
its
voice
was
supposed
to
reverberate
in
barbara
and
celarent
so
also
of
the
of
nature
physical
and
chemical
so
of
natural
history
classifications
all
were
supposed
to
be
exact
and
exclusive
duplicates
of
archetypes
buried
in
the
structure
of
things
to
which
the
spark
of
divinity
hidden
in
our
intellect
enables
us
to
penetrate
the
anatomy
of
the
world
is
logical
and
its
logic
is
that
of
a
university
professor
it
was
thought
up
to
about
almost
every
one
believed
that
sciences
expressed
truths
that
were
exact
copies
of
a
definite
code
of
realities
but
the
enormously
rapid
multiplication
of
theories
in
these
latter
days
has
upset
the
notion
of
any
one
of
them
being
a
more
literally
objective
kind
of
thing
than
another
there
are
so
many
geometries
so
many
logics
so
many
physical
and
chemical
hypotheses
so
many
classifications
each
one
of
them
good
for
so
much
and
yet
not
good
for
everything
that
the
notion
that
even
the
truest
formula
may
be
a
human
device
and
not
a
literal
transcript
has
dawned
upon
us
we
hear
scientific
laws
now
treated
as
so
much
shorthand
true
so
far
as
they
are
useful
but
no
farther
our
mind
has
become
tolerant
of
symbol
instead
of
reproduction
of
approximation
instead
of
exactness
of
plasticity
instead
of
rigor
measuring
the
bare
face
of
sensible
phenomena
so
as
to
describe
in
a
single
formula
all
their
changes
of
is
the
last
word
of
this
scientific
humanism
which
indeed
leaves
queries
enough
outstanding
as
to
the
reason
for
so
curious
a
congruence
between
the
world
and
the
mind
but
which
at
any
rate
makes
our
whole
notion
of
scientific
truth
more
flexible
and
genial
than
it
used
to
be
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
any
theorizer
either
in
mathematics
logic
physics
or
biology
conceives
himself
to
be
literally
processes
of
nature
or
thoughts
of
god
the
main
forms
of
our
thinking
the
separation
of
subjects
from
predicates
the
negative
hypothetic
and
disjunctive
judgments
are
purely
human
habits
the
ether
as
lord
salisbury
said
is
only
a
noun
for
the
verb
to
undulate
and
many
of
our
theological
ideas
are
admitted
even
by
those
who
call
them
to
be
humanistic
in
like
degree
i
fancy
that
these
changes
in
the
current
notions
of
truth
are
what
originally
gave
the
impulse
to
dewey
and
schiller
views
the
suspicion
is
in
the
air
nowadays
that
the
superiority
of
one
of
our
formulas
to
another
may
not
consist
so
much
in
its
literal
as
in
subjective
qualities
like
its
usefulness
its
or
its
congruity
with
our
residual
beliefs
yielding
to
these
suspicions
and
generalizing
we
fall
into
something
like
the
humanistic
state
of
mind
truth
we
conceive
to
mean
everywhere
not
duplication
but
addition
not
the
constructing
of
inner
copies
of
already
complete
realities
but
rather
the
collaborating
with
realities
so
as
to
bring
about
a
clearer
result
obviously
this
state
of
mind
is
at
first
full
of
vagueness
and
ambiguity
is
a
vague
term
it
must
at
any
rate
cover
conceptions
and
logical
arrangements
is
vaguer
still
truth
must
bring
clear
thoughts
as
well
as
clear
the
way
to
action
is
the
vaguest
term
of
all
the
only
way
to
test
such
a
programme
at
all
is
to
apply
it
to
the
various
types
of
truth
in
the
hope
of
reaching
an
account
that
shall
be
more
precise
any
hypothesis
that
forces
such
a
review
upon
one
has
one
great
merit
even
if
in
the
end
it
prove
invalid
it
gets
us
better
acquainted
with
the
total
subject
to
give
the
theory
plenty
of
and
see
if
it
hangs
itself
eventually
is
better
tactics
than
to
choke
it
off
at
the
outset
by
abstract
accusations
of
i
think
therefore
that
a
decided
effort
at
sympathetic
mental
play
with
humanism
is
the
provisional
attitude
to
be
recommended
to
the
reader
when
i
find
myself
playing
sympathetically
with
humanism
something
like
what
follows
is
what
i
end
by
conceiving
it
to
mean
experience
is
a
process
that
continually
gives
us
new
material
to
digest
we
handle
this
intellectually
by
the
mass
of
beliefs
of
which
we
find
ourselves
already
possessed
assimilating
rejecting
or
rearranging
in
different
degrees
some
of
the
apperceiving
ideas
are
recent
acquisitions
of
our
own
but
most
of
them
are
traditions
of
the
race
there
is
probably
not
a
tradition
of
all
those
which
we
now
live
by
that
was
not
in
the
first
instance
a
genuine
discovery
an
inductive
generalization
like
those
more
recent
ones
of
the
atom
of
inertia
of
energy
of
reflex
action
or
of
fitness
to
survive
the
notions
of
one
time
and
of
one
space
as
single
continuous
receptacles
the
distinction
between
thoughts
and
things
matter
and
mind
between
permanent
subjects
and
changing
attributes
the
conception
of
classes
with
sub
classes
within
them
the
separation
of
fortuitous
from
regularly
caused
connections
surely
all
these
were
once
definite
conquests
made
at
historic
dates
by
our
ancestors
in
their
attempt
to
get
the
chaos
of
their
crude
individual
experiences
into
a
more
shareable
and
manageable
shape
they
proved
of
such
sovereign
use
as
denkmittel
that
they
are
now
a
part
of
the
very
structure
of
our
mind
we
can
not
play
fast
and
loose
with
them
no
experience
can
upset
them
on
the
contrary
they
apperceive
every
experience
and
assign
it
to
its
place
to
what
effect
that
we
may
the
better
foresee
the
course
of
our
experiences
communicate
with
one
another
and
steer
our
lives
by
rule
also
that
we
may
have
a
cleaner
clearer
more
inclusive
mental
view
the
greatest
achievement
after
the
discovery
of
one
time
and
one
space
is
probably
the
concept
of
permanently
existing
things
when
a
rattle
first
drops
out
of
the
hand
of
a
baby
he
does
not
look
to
see
where
it
has
gone
he
accepts
as
annihilation
until
he
finds
a
better
belief
that
our
perceptions
mean
beings
rattles
that
are
there
whether
we
hold
them
in
our
hands
or
not
becomes
an
interpretation
so
luminous
of
what
happens
to
us
that
once
employed
it
never
gets
forgotten
it
applies
with
equal
felicity
to
things
and
persons
to
the
objective
and
to
the
ejective
realm
however
a
berkeley
a
mill
or
a
cornelius
may
criticise
it
it
works
and
in
practical
life
we
never
think
of
back
upon
it
or
reading
our
incoming
experiences
in
any
other
terms
we
may
indeed
speculatively
imagine
a
state
of
experience
before
the
hypothesis
of
permanent
objects
behind
its
flux
had
been
framed
and
we
can
play
with
the
idea
that
some
primeval
genius
might
have
struck
into
a
different
hypothesis
but
we
can
not
positively
imagine
today
what
the
different
hypothesis
could
have
been
for
the
category
of
reality
is
now
one
of
the
foundations
of
our
life
our
thoughts
must
still
employ
it
if
they
are
to
possess
reasonableness
and
truth
this
notion
of
a
first
in
the
shape
of
a
most
chaotic
pure
experience
which
sets
us
questions
of
a
second
in
the
way
of
fundamental
categories
long
ago
wrought
into
the
structure
of
our
consciousness
and
practically
irreversible
which
define
the
general
frame
within
which
answers
must
fall
and
of
a
third
which
gives
the
detail
of
the
answers
in
the
shapes
most
congruous
with
all
our
present
needs
is
as
i
take
it
the
essence
of
the
humanistic
conception
it
represents
experience
in
its
pristine
purity
to
be
now
so
enveloped
in
predicates
historically
worked
out
that
we
can
think
of
it
as
little
more
than
an
other
of
a
that
which
the
mind
in
bradley
phrase
and
to
whose
stimulating
presence
we
respond
by
ways
of
thinking
which
we
call
in
proportion
as
they
facilitate
our
mental
or
physical
activities
and
bring
us
outer
power
and
inner
peace
but
whether
the
other
the
universal
that
has
itself
any
definite
inner
structure
or
whether
if
it
have
any
the
structure
resembles
any
of
our
predicated
whats
this
is
a
question
which
humanism
leaves
untouched
for
us
at
any
rate
it
insists
reality
is
an
accumulation
of
our
own
intellectual
inventions
and
the
struggle
for
in
our
progressive
dealings
with
it
is
always
a
struggle
to
work
in
new
nouns
and
adjectives
while
altering
as
little
as
possible
the
old
it
is
hard
to
see
why
either
bradley
own
logic
or
his
metaphysics
should
oblige
him
to
quarrel
with
this
conception
he
might
consistently
adopt
it
verbatim
et
literatim
if
he
would
and
simply
throw
his
peculiar
absolute
round
it
following
in
this
the
good
example
of
professor
royce
bergson
in
france
and
his
disciples
wilbois
the
physicist
and
leroy
are
thoroughgoing
humanists
in
the
sense
defined
professor
milhaud
also
appears
to
be
one
and
the
great
poincare
misses
it
by
only
the
breadth
of
a
hair
in
germany
the
name
of
simmel
offers
itself
as
that
of
a
humanist
of
the
most
radical
sort
mach
and
his
school
and
hertz
and
ostwald
must
be
classed
as
humanists
the
view
is
in
the
atmosphere
and
must
be
patiently
discussed
the
best
way
to
discuss
it
would
be
to
see
what
the
alternative
might
be
what
is
it
indeed
its
critics
make
no
explicit
statement
professor
royce
being
the
only
one
so
far
who
has
formulated
anything
definite
the
first
service
of
humanism
to
philosophy
accordingly
seems
to
be
that
it
will
probably
oblige
those
who
dislike
it
to
search
their
own
hearts
and
heads
it
will
force
analysis
to
the
front
and
make
it
the
order
of
the
day
at
present
the
lazy
tradition
that
truth
is
adaequatio
intellectus
et
rei
seems
all
there
is
to
contradict
it
with
bradley
only
suggestion
is
that
true
thought
correspond
to
a
determinate
being
which
it
can
not
be
said
to
make
and
obviously
that
sheds
no
new
light
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
to
where
is
the
what
sort
of
things
are
and
what
is
meant
in
this
particular
case
by
to
make
humanism
proceeds
immediately
to
refine
upon
the
looseness
of
these
epithets
we
correspond
in
some
way
with
anything
with
which
we
enter
into
any
relations
at
all
if
it
be
a
thing
we
may
produce
an
exact
copy
of
it
or
we
may
simply
feel
it
as
an
existent
in
a
certain
place
if
it
be
a
demand
we
may
obey
it
without
knowing
anything
more
about
it
than
its
push
if
it
be
a
proposition
we
may
agree
by
not
contradicting
it
by
letting
it
pass
if
it
be
a
relation
between
things
we
may
act
on
the
first
thing
so
as
to
bring
ourselves
out
where
the
second
will
be
if
it
be
something
inaccessible
we
may
substitute
a
hypothetical
object
for
it
which
having
the
same
consequences
will
cipher
out
for
us
real
results
in
a
general
way
we
may
simply
add
our
thought
to
it
and
if
it
suffers
the
addition
and
the
whole
situation
harmoniously
prolongs
and
enriches
itself
the
thought
will
pass
for
true
as
for
the
whereabouts
of
the
beings
thus
corresponded
to
although
they
may
be
outside
of
the
present
thought
as
well
as
in
it
humanism
sees
no
ground
for
saying
they
are
outside
of
finite
experience
itself
pragmatically
their
reality
means
that
we
submit
to
them
take
account
of
them
whether
we
like
to
or
not
but
this
we
must
perpetually
do
with
experiences
other
than
our
own
the
whole
system
of
what
the
present
experience
must
correspond
to
may
be
continuous
with
the
present
experience
itself
reality
so
taken
as
experience
other
than
the
present
might
be
either
the
legacy
of
past
experience
or
the
content
of
experience
to
come
its
determinations
for
us
are
in
any
case
the
adjectives
which
our
acts
of
judging
fit
to
it
and
those
are
essentially
humanistic
things
to
say
that
our
thought
does
not
this
reality
means
pragmatically
that
if
our
own
particular
thought
were
annihilated
the
reality
would
still
be
there
in
some
shape
though
possibly
it
might
be
a
shape
that
would
lack
something
that
our
thought
supplies
that
reality
is
means
that
there
is
something
in
every
experience
that
escapes
our
arbitrary
control
if
it
be
a
sensible
experience
it
coerces
our
attention
if
a
sequence
we
can
not
invert
it
if
we
compare
two
terms
we
can
come
to
only
one
result
there
is
a
push
an
urgency
within
our
very
experience
against
which
we
are
on
the
whole
powerless
and
which
drives
us
in
a
direction
that
is
the
destiny
of
our
belief
that
this
drift
of
experience
itself
is
in
the
last
resort
due
to
something
independent
of
all
possible
experience
may
or
may
not
be
true
there
may
or
may
not
be
an
an
sich
that
keeps
the
ball
rolling
or
an
that
lies
eternally
behind
all
the
successive
determinations
which
human
thought
has
made
but
within
our
experience
itself
at
any
rate
humanism
says
some
determinations
show
themselves
as
being
independent
of
others
some
questions
if
we
ever
ask
them
can
only
be
answered
in
one
way
some
beings
if
we
ever
suppose
them
must
be
supposed
to
have
existed
previously
to
the
supposing
some
relations
if
they
exist
ever
must
exist
as
long
as
their
terms
exist
truth
thus
means
according
to
humanism
the
relation
of
less
fixed
parts
of
experience
predicates
to
other
relatively
more
fixed
parts
subjects
and
we
are
not
required
to
seek
it
in
a
relation
of
experience
as
such
to
anything
beyond
itself
we
can
stay
at
home
for
our
behavior
as
exponents
is
hemmed
in
on
every
side
the
forces
both
of
advance
and
of
resistance
are
exerted
by
our
own
objects
and
the
notion
of
truth
as
something
opposed
to
waywardness
or
license
inevitably
grows
up
solipsistically
inside
of
every
human
life
so
obvious
is
all
this
that
a
common
charge
against
the
humanistic
authors
me
tired
can
a
deweyite
discriminate
sincerity
from
bluff
was
a
question
asked
at
a
philosophic
meeting
where
i
reported
on
dewey
studies
can
the
mere
footnote
i
know
of
no
pragmatist
if
mereness
here
means
as
it
seems
to
the
denial
of
all
concreteness
to
the
pragmatist
thought
pragmatist
feel
any
duty
to
think
truly
is
the
objection
urged
by
professor
royce
bradley
in
turn
says
that
if
a
humanist
understands
his
own
doctrine
must
hold
any
idea
however
mad
to
be
the
truth
if
any
one
will
have
it
so
and
professor
taylor
describes
pragmatism
as
believing
anything
one
pleases
and
calling
it
truth
such
a
shallow
sense
of
the
conditions
under
which
men
thinking
actually
goes
on
seems
to
me
most
surprising
these
critics
appear
to
suppose
that
if
left
to
itself
the
rudderless
raft
of
our
experience
must
be
ready
to
drift
anywhere
or
nowhere
even
tho
there
were
compasses
on
board
they
seem
to
say
there
would
be
no
pole
for
them
to
point
to
there
must
be
absolute
they
insist
decreed
from
outside
and
an
independent
chart
of
the
voyage
added
to
the
voyage
itself
if
we
are
ever
to
make
a
port
but
is
it
not
obvious
that
even
tho
there
be
such
absolute
in
the
shape
of
standards
of
truth
that
we
ought
to
follow
the
only
guarantee
that
we
shall
in
fact
follow
them
must
lie
in
our
human
equipment
the
would
be
a
brutum
fulmen
unless
there
were
a
felt
grain
inside
of
our
experience
that
conspired
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
devoutest
believers
in
absolute
standards
must
admit
that
men
fail
to
obey
them
waywardness
is
here
in
spite
of
the
eternal
prohibitions
and
the
existence
of
any
amount
of
reality
ante
rem
is
no
warrant
against
unlimited
error
in
rebus
being
incurred
the
only
real
guarantee
we
have
against
licentious
thinking
is
the
circumpressure
of
experience
itself
which
gets
us
sick
of
concrete
errors
whether
there
be
a
reality
or
not
how
does
the
partisan
of
absolute
reality
know
what
this
orders
him
to
think
he
can
not
get
direct
sight
of
the
absolute
and
he
has
no
means
of
guessing
what
it
wants
of
him
except
by
following
the
humanistic
clues
the
only
truth
that
he
himself
will
ever
practically
accept
will
be
that
to
which
his
finite
experiences
lead
him
of
themselves
the
state
of
mind
which
shudders
at
the
idea
of
a
lot
of
experiences
left
to
themselves
and
that
augurs
protection
from
the
sheer
name
of
an
absolute
as
if
however
inoperative
that
might
still
stand
for
a
sort
of
ghostly
security
is
like
the
mood
of
those
good
people
who
whenever
they
hear
of
a
social
tendency
that
is
damnable
begin
to
redden
and
to
puff
and
say
or
congress
ought
to
make
a
law
against
it
as
if
an
impotent
decree
would
give
relief
all
the
sanctions
of
a
law
of
truth
lie
in
the
very
texture
of
experience
absolute
or
no
absolute
the
concrete
truth
for
us
will
always
be
that
way
of
thinking
in
which
our
various
experiences
most
profitably
combine
and
yet
the
opponent
obstinately
urges
your
humanist
will
always
have
a
greater
liberty
to
play
fast
and
loose
with
truth
than
will
your
believer
in
an
independent
realm
of
reality
that
makes
the
standard
rigid
if
by
this
latter
believer
he
means
a
man
who
pretends
to
know
the
standard
and
who
fulminates
it
the
humanist
will
doubtless
prove
more
flexible
but
no
more
flexible
than
the
absolutist
himself
if
the
latter
follows
as
fortunately
our
absolutists
do
follow
empirical
methods
of
inquiry
in
concrete
affairs
to
consider
hypotheses
is
surely
always
better
than
to
dogmatise
ins
blaue
hinein
nevertheless
this
probable
flexibility
of
temper
in
him
has
been
used
to
convict
the
humanist
of
sin
believing
as
he
does
that
truth
lies
in
rebus
and
is
at
every
moment
our
own
line
of
most
propitious
reaction
he
stands
forever
debarred
as
i
have
heard
a
learned
colleague
say
from
trying
to
convert
opponents
for
does
not
their
view
being
their
most
propitious
momentary
reaction
already
fill
the
bill
only
the
believer
in
the
brand
of
truth
can
on
this
theory
seek
to
make
converts
without
but
can
there
be
in
urging
any
account
whatever
of
truth
can
the
definition
ever
contradict
the
deed
is
what
i
feel
like
saying
suppose
that
to
be
the
definition
i
feel
like
saying
that
and
i
want
you
to
feel
like
saying
it
and
shall
continue
to
say
it
until
i
get
you
to
agree
where
is
there
any
contradiction
whatever
truth
may
be
said
to
be
that
is
the
kind
of
truth
which
the
saying
can
be
held
to
carry
the
temper
which
a
saying
may
comport
is
an
matter
it
may
indeed
be
hotter
in
some
individual
absolutist
than
in
a
humanist
but
it
need
not
be
so
in
another
and
the
humanist
for
his
part
is
perfectly
consistent
in
compassing
sea
and
land
to
make
one
proselyte
if
his
nature
be
enthusiastic
enough
how
can
you
be
enthusiastic
over
any
view
of
things
which
you
know
to
have
been
partly
made
by
yourself
and
which
is
liable
to
alter
during
the
next
minute
how
is
any
heroic
devotion
to
the
ideal
of
truth
possible
under
such
paltry
conditions
this
is
just
another
of
those
objections
by
which
the
show
their
own
comparatively
slack
hold
on
the
realities
of
the
situation
if
they
would
only
follow
the
pragmatic
method
and
ask
is
truth
what
does
its
existence
stand
for
in
the
way
of
concrete
goods
they
would
see
that
the
name
of
it
is
the
inbegriff
of
almost
everything
that
is
valuable
in
our
lives
the
true
is
the
opposite
of
whatever
is
instable
of
whatever
is
practically
disappointing
of
whatever
is
useless
of
whatever
is
lying
and
unreliable
of
whatever
is
unverifiable
and
unsupported
of
whatever
is
inconsistent
and
contradictory
of
whatever
is
artificial
and
eccentric
of
whatever
is
unreal
in
the
sense
of
being
of
no
practical
account
here
are
pragmatic
reasons
with
a
vengeance
why
we
should
turn
to
truth
truth
saves
us
from
a
world
of
that
complexion
what
wonder
that
its
very
name
awakens
loyal
feeling
in
particular
what
wonder
that
all
little
provisional
fool
paradises
of
belief
should
appear
contemptible
in
comparison
with
its
bare
pursuit
when
absolutists
reject
humanism
because
they
feel
it
to
be
untrue
that
means
that
the
whole
habit
of
their
mental
needs
is
wedded
already
to
a
different
view
of
reality
in
comparison
with
which
the
humanistic
world
seems
but
the
whim
of
a
few
irresponsible
youths
their
own
subjective
apperceiving
mass
is
what
speaks
here
in
the
name
of
the
eternal
natures
and
bids
them
reject
our
humanism
as
they
apprehend
it
just
so
with
us
humanists
when
we
condemn
all
noble
fixed
eternal
rational
systems
of
philosophy
these
contradict
the
dramatic
temperament
of
nature
as
our
dealings
with
nature
and
our
habits
of
thinking
have
so
far
brought
us
to
conceive
it
they
seem
oddly
personal
and
artificial
even
when
not
bureaucratic
and
professional
in
an
absurd
degree
we
turn
from
them
to
the
great
unpent
and
unstayed
wilderness
of
truth
as
we
feel
it
to
be
constituted
with
as
good
a
conscience
as
rationalists
are
moved
by
when
they
turn
from
our
wilderness
into
their
neater
and
cleaner
intellectual
abodes

this
is
surely
enough
to
show
that
the
humanist
does
not
ignore
the
character
of
objectivity
and
independence
in
truth
let
me
turn
next
to
what
his
opponents
mean
when
they
say
that
to
be
true
our
thoughts
must
the
vulgar
notion
of
correspondence
here
is
that
the
thoughts
must
copy
the
reality
cognitio
fit
per
assimiliationem
cogniti
et
cognoscentis
and
philosophy
without
having
ever
fairly
sat
down
to
the
question
seems
to
have
instinctively
accepted
this
idea
propositions
are
held
true
if
they
copy
the
eternal
thought
terms
are
held
true
if
they
copy
realities
implicitly
i
think
that
the
has
animated
most
of
the
criticisms
that
have
been
made
on
humanism
a
priori
however
it
is
not
that
the
sole
business
of
our
mind
with
realities
should
be
to
copy
them
let
my
reader
suppose
himself
to
constitute
for
a
time
all
the
reality
there
is
in
the
universe
and
then
to
receive
the
announcement
that
another
being
is
to
be
created
who
shall
know
him
truly
how
will
he
represent
the
knowing
in
advance
what
will
he
hope
it
to
be
i
doubt
extremely
whether
it
could
ever
occur
to
him
to
fancy
it
as
a
mere
copying
of
what
use
to
him
would
an
imperfect
second
edition
of
himself
in
the
new
interior
be
it
would
seem
pure
waste
of
a
propitious
opportunity
the
demand
would
more
probably
be
for
something
absolutely
new
the
reader
would
conceive
the
knowing
humanistically
new
comer
he
would
say
take
account
of
my
presence
by
reacting
on
it
in
such
a
way
that
good
would
accrue
to
us
both
if
copying
be
requisite
to
that
end
let
there
be
copying
otherwise
not
the
essence
in
any
case
would
not
be
the
copying
but
the
enrichment
of
the
previous
world
i
read
the
other
day
in
a
book
of
professor
eucken
a
phrase
erhohung
des
vorgefundenen
daseins
which
seems
to
be
pertinent
here
why
may
not
thought
mission
be
to
increase
and
elevate
rather
than
simply
to
imitate
and
reduplicate
existence
no
one
who
has
read
lotze
can
fail
to
remember
his
striking
comment
on
the
ordinary
view
of
the
secondary
qualities
of
matter
which
brands
them
as
because
they
copy
nothing
in
the
thing
the
notion
of
a
world
complete
in
itself
to
which
thought
comes
as
a
passive
mirror
adding
nothing
to
fact
lotze
says
is
irrational
rather
is
thought
itself
a
most
momentous
part
of
fact
and
the
whole
mission
of
the
and
insufficient
world
of
matter
may
simply
be
to
provoke
thought
to
produce
its
far
more
precious
supplement
in
short
may
for
aught
we
can
see
beforehand
to
the
contrary
be
only
one
way
of
getting
into
fruitful
relations
with
reality
whether
copying
be
one
of
the
relations
or
not
it
is
easy
to
see
from
what
special
type
of
knowing
the
arose
in
our
dealings
with
natural
phenomena
the
great
point
is
to
be
able
to
foretell
foretelling
according
to
such
a
writer
as
spencer
is
the
whole
meaning
of
intelligence
when
spencer
of
says
that
inner
and
outer
relations
must
it
means
that
the
distribution
of
terms
in
our
inner
and
must
be
an
exact
copy
of
the
distribution
in
real
time
and
space
of
the
real
terms
in
strict
theory
the
mental
terms
themselves
need
not
answer
to
the
real
terms
in
the
sense
of
severally
copying
them
symbolic
mental
terms
being
enough
if
only
the
real
dates
and
places
be
copied
but
in
our
ordinary
life
the
mental
terms
are
images
and
the
real
ones
are
sensations
and
the
images
so
often
copy
the
sensations
that
we
easily
take
copying
of
terms
as
well
as
of
relations
to
be
the
natural
significance
of
knowing
meanwhile
much
even
of
this
common
descriptive
truth
is
couched
in
verbal
symbols
if
our
symbols
fit
the
world
in
the
sense
of
determining
our
expectations
rightly
they
may
even
be
the
better
for
not
copying
its
terms
it
seems
obvious
that
the
pragmatic
account
of
all
this
routine
of
phenomenal
knowledge
is
accurate
truth
here
is
a
relation
not
of
our
ideas
to
realities
but
of
conceptual
parts
of
our
experience
to
sensational
parts
those
thoughts
are
true
which
guide
us
to
beneficial
interaction
with
sensible
particulars
as
they
occur
whether
they
copy
these
in
advance
or
not
from
the
frequency
of
copying
in
the
knowledge
of
phenomenal
fact
copying
has
been
supposed
to
be
the
essence
of
truth
in
matters
rational
also
geometry
and
logic
it
has
been
supposed
must
copy
archetypal
thoughts
in
the
creator
but
in
these
abstract
spheres
there
is
no
need
of
assuming
archetypes
the
mind
is
free
to
carve
so
many
figures
out
of
space
to
make
so
many
numerical
collections
to
frame
so
many
classes
and
series
and
it
can
analyze
and
compare
so
endlessly
that
the
very
superabundance
of
the
resulting
ideas
makes
us
doubt
the
of
their
models
it
would
be
plainly
wrong
to
suppose
a
god
whose
thought
consecrated
rectangular
but
not
polar
or
jevons
notation
but
not
boole
yet
if
on
the
other
hand
we
assume
god
to
have
thought
in
advance
of
every
possible
flight
of
human
fancy
in
these
directions
his
mind
becomes
too
much
like
a
hindoo
idol
with
three
heads
eight
arms
and
six
breasts
too
much
made
up
of
superfoetation
and
redundancy
for
us
to
wish
to
copy
it
and
the
whole
notion
of
copying
tends
to
evaporate
from
these
sciences
their
objects
can
be
better
interpreted
as
being
created
step
by
step
by
men
as
fast
as
they
successively
conceive
them
if
now
it
be
asked
how
if
triangles
squares
square
roots
genera
and
the
like
are
but
improvised
human
their
properties
and
relations
can
be
so
promptly
known
to
be
the
humanistic
answer
is
easy
if
triangles
and
genera
are
of
our
own
production
we
can
keep
them
invariant
we
can
make
them
by
expressly
decreeing
that
on
the
things
we
mean
time
shall
exert
no
altering
effect
that
they
are
intentionally
and
it
may
be
fictitiously
abstracted
from
every
corrupting
real
associate
and
condition
but
relations
between
invariant
objects
will
themselves
be
invariant
such
relations
can
not
be
happenings
for
by
hypothesis
nothing
shall
happen
to
the
objects
i
have
tried
to
show
in
the
last
chapter
of
my
principles
of
psychology
footnote
vol
ii
pp
ff
that
they
can
only
be
relations
of
comparison
no
one
so
far
seems
to
have
noticed
my
suggestion
and
i
am
too
ignorant
of
the
development
of
mathematics
to
feel
very
confident
of
my
own
view
but
if
it
were
correct
it
would
solve
the
difficulty
perfectly
relations
of
comparison
are
matters
of
direct
inspection
as
soon
as
mental
objects
are
mentally
compared
they
are
perceived
to
be
either
like
or
unlike
but
once
the
same
always
the
same
once
different
always
different
under
these
timeless
conditions
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
truths
concerning
these
objects
are
necessary
and
eternal
we
can
change
our
conclusions
only
by
changing
our
data
first
the
whole
fabric
of
the
a
priori
sciences
can
thus
be
treated
as
a
product
as
locke
long
ago
pointed
out
these
sciences
have
no
immediate
connection
with
fact
only
if
a
fact
can
be
humanized
by
being
identified
with
any
of
these
ideal
objects
is
what
was
true
of
the
objects
now
true
also
of
the
facts
the
truth
itself
meanwhile
was
originally
a
copy
of
nothing
it
was
only
a
relation
directly
perceived
to
obtain
between
two
artificial
mental
things
footnote
mental
things
which
are
realities
of
course
within
the
mental
world
we
may
now
glance
at
some
special
types
of
knowing
so
as
to
see
better
whether
the
humanistic
account
fits
on
the
mathematical
and
logical
types
we
need
not
enlarge
further
nor
need
we
return
at
much
length
to
the
case
of
our
descriptive
knowledge
of
the
course
of
nature
so
far
as
this
involves
anticipation
tho
that
may
mean
copying
it
need
as
we
saw
mean
little
more
than
ready
in
advance
but
with
many
distant
and
future
objects
our
practical
relations
are
to
the
last
degree
potential
and
remote
in
no
sense
can
we
now
get
ready
for
the
arrest
of
the
earth
revolution
by
the
tidal
brake
for
instance
and
with
the
past
tho
we
suppose
ourselves
to
know
it
truly
we
have
no
practical
relations
at
all
it
is
obvious
that
altho
interests
strictly
practical
have
been
the
original
of
our
search
for
true
phenomenal
descriptions
yet
an
intrinsic
interest
in
the
bare
describing
function
has
grown
up
we
wish
accounts
that
shall
be
true
whether
they
bring
collateral
profit
or
not
the
primitive
function
has
developed
its
demand
for
mere
exercise
this
theoretic
curiosity
seems
to
be
the
characteristically
human
differentia
and
humanism
recognizes
its
enormous
scope
a
true
idea
now
means
not
only
one
that
prepares
us
for
an
actual
perception
it
means
also
one
that
might
prepare
us
for
a
merely
possible
perception
or
one
that
if
spoken
would
suggest
possible
perceptions
to
others
or
suggest
actual
perceptions
which
the
speaker
can
not
share
the
ensemble
of
perceptions
thus
thought
of
as
either
actual
or
possible
form
a
system
which
it
is
obviously
advantageous
to
us
to
get
into
a
stable
and
consistent
shape
and
here
it
is
that
the
notion
of
permanent
beings
finds
triumphant
use
beings
acting
outside
of
the
thinker
explain
not
only
his
actual
perceptions
past
and
future
but
his
possible
perceptions
and
those
of
every
one
else
accordingly
they
gratify
our
theoretic
need
in
a
supremely
beautiful
way
we
pass
from
our
immediate
actual
through
them
into
the
foreign
and
the
potential
and
back
again
into
the
future
actual
accounting
for
innumerable
particulars
by
a
single
cause
as
in
those
circular
panoramas
where
a
real
foreground
of
dirt
grass
bushes
rocks
and
a
cannon
is
enveloped
by
a
canvas
picture
of
sky
and
earth
and
of
a
raging
battle
continuing
the
foreground
so
cunningly
that
the
spectator
can
detect
no
joint
so
these
conceptual
objects
added
to
our
present
perceptual
reality
fuse
with
it
into
the
whole
universe
of
our
belief
in
spite
of
all
berkeleyan
criticism
we
do
not
doubt
that
they
are
really
there
tho
our
discovery
of
any
one
of
them
may
only
date
from
now
we
unhesitatingly
say
that
it
not
only
is
but
was
there
if
by
so
saying
the
past
appears
connected
more
consistently
with
what
we
feel
the
present
to
be
this
is
historic
truth
moses
wrote
the
pentateuch
we
think
because
if
he
did
all
our
religious
habits
will
have
to
be
undone
julius
caesar
was
real
or
we
can
never
listen
to
history
again
trilobites
were
once
alive
or
all
our
thought
about
the
strata
is
at
sea
radium
discovered
only
yesterday
must
always
have
existed
or
its
analogy
with
other
natural
elements
which
are
permanent
fails
in
all
this
it
is
but
one
portion
of
our
beliefs
reacting
on
another
so
as
to
yield
the
most
satisfactory
total
state
of
mind
that
state
of
mind
we
say
sees
truth
and
the
content
of
its
deliverances
we
believe
of
course
if
you
take
the
satisfactoriness
concretely
as
something
felt
by
you
now
and
if
by
truth
you
mean
truth
taken
abstractly
and
verified
in
the
long
run
you
can
not
make
them
equate
for
it
is
notorious
that
the
temporarily
satisfactory
is
often
false
yet
at
each
and
every
concrete
moment
truth
for
each
man
is
what
that
man
at
that
moment
with
the
maximum
of
satisfaction
to
himself
and
similarly
abstract
truth
truth
verified
by
the
long
run
and
abstract
satisfactoriness
satisfactoriness
coincide
if
in
short
we
compare
concrete
with
concrete
and
abstract
with
abstract
the
true
and
the
satisfactory
do
mean
the
same
thing
i
suspect
that
a
certain
muddling
of
matters
hereabouts
is
what
makes
the
general
philosophic
public
so
impervious
to
humanism
claims
the
fundamental
fact
about
our
experience
is
that
it
is
a
process
of
change
for
the
at
any
moment
truth
like
the
visible
area
round
a
man
walking
in
a
fog
or
like
what
george
eliot
calls
wall
of
dark
seen
by
small
fishes
eyes
that
pierce
a
span
in
the
wide
ocean
is
an
objective
field
which
the
next
moment
enlarges
and
of
which
it
is
the
critic
and
which
then
either
suffers
alteration
or
is
continued
unchanged
the
critic
sees
both
the
first
trower
truth
and
his
own
truth
compares
them
with
each
other
and
verifies
or
confutes
his
field
of
view
is
the
reality
independent
of
that
earlier
thinking
with
which
that
thinking
ought
to
correspond
but
the
critic
is
himself
only
a
trower
and
if
the
whole
process
of
experience
should
terminate
at
that
instant
there
would
be
no
otherwise
known
independent
reality
with
which
his
thought
might
be
compared
the
immediate
in
experience
is
always
provisionally
in
this
situation
the
humanism
for
instance
which
i
see
and
try
so
hard
to
defend
is
the
completest
truth
attained
from
my
point
of
view
up
to
date
but
owing
to
the
fact
that
all
experience
is
a
process
no
point
of
view
can
ever
be
the
last
one
every
one
is
insufficient
and
off
its
balance
and
responsible
to
later
points
of
view
than
itself
you
occupying
some
of
these
later
points
in
your
own
person
and
believing
in
the
reality
of
others
will
not
agree
that
my
point
of
view
sees
truth
positive
truth
timeless
truth
that
counts
unless
they
verify
and
confirm
what
it
sees
you
generalize
this
by
saying
that
any
opinion
however
satisfactory
can
count
positively
and
absolutely
as
true
only
so
far
as
it
agrees
with
a
standard
beyond
itself
and
if
you
then
forget
that
this
standard
perpetually
grows
up
endogenously
inside
the
web
of
the
experiences
you
may
carelessly
go
on
to
say
that
what
distributively
holds
of
each
experience
holds
also
collectively
of
all
experience
and
that
experience
as
such
and
in
its
totality
owes
whatever
truth
it
may
be
to
its
correspondence
with
absolute
realities
outside
of
its
own
being
this
evidently
is
the
popular
and
traditional
position
from
the
fact
that
finite
experiences
must
draw
support
from
one
another
philosophers
pass
to
the
notion
that
experience
uberhaupt
must
need
an
absolute
support
the
denial
of
such
a
notion
by
humanism
lies
probably
at
the
root
of
most
of
the
dislike
which
it
incurs
but
is
this
not
the
globe
the
elephant
and
the
tortoise
over
again
must
not
something
end
by
supporting
itself
humanism
is
willing
to
let
finite
experience
be
somewhere
being
must
immediately
breast
nonentity
why
may
not
the
advancing
front
of
experience
carrying
its
immanent
satisfactions
and
dissatisfactions
cut
against
the
black
inane
as
the
luminous
orb
of
the
moon
cuts
the
caerulean
abyss
why
should
anywhere
the
world
be
absolutely
fixed
and
finished
and
if
reality
genuinely
grows
why
may
it
not
grow
in
these
very
determinations
which
here
and
now
are
made
in
point
of
fact
it
actually
seems
to
grow
by
our
mental
determinations
be
these
never
so
take
the
bear
or
constellation
in
the
heavens
we
call
it
by
that
name
we
count
the
stars
and
call
them
seven
we
say
they
were
seven
before
they
were
counted
and
we
say
that
whether
any
one
had
ever
noted
the
fact
or
not
the
dim
resemblance
to
a
or
animal
was
always
truly
there
but
what
do
we
mean
by
this
projection
into
past
eternity
of
recent
human
ways
of
thinking
did
an
thinker
actually
do
the
counting
tell
off
the
stars
upon
his
standing
and
make
the
silly
as
the
latter
is
were
they
explicitly
seven
explicitly
before
the
human
witness
came
surely
nothing
in
the
truth
of
the
attributions
drives
us
to
think
this
they
were
only
implicitly
or
virtually
what
we
call
them
and
we
human
witnesses
first
explicated
them
and
made
them
a
fact
virtually
when
every
condition
of
its
realization
save
one
is
already
there
in
this
case
the
condition
lacking
is
the
act
of
the
counting
and
comparing
mind
but
the
stars
once
the
mind
considers
them
themselves
dictate
the
result
the
counting
in
no
wise
modifies
their
previous
nature
and
they
being
what
and
where
they
are
the
count
can
not
fall
out
differently
it
could
then
always
be
made
never
could
the
number
seven
be
questioned
if
the
question
once
were
raised
we
have
here
a
undeniably
something
comes
by
the
counting
that
was
not
there
before
and
yet
that
something
was
always
true
in
one
sense
you
create
it
and
in
another
sense
you
find
it
you
have
to
treat
your
count
as
being
true
beforehand
the
moment
you
come
to
treat
the
matter
at
all
our
stellar
attributes
must
always
be
called
true
then
yet
none
the
less
are
they
genuine
additions
made
by
our
intellect
to
the
world
of
fact
not
additions
of
consciousness
only
but
additions
of
they
copy
nothing
that
yet
they
agree
with
what
fit
it
amplify
it
relate
and
connect
it
with
a
a
or
what
not
and
build
it
out
it
seems
to
me
that
humanism
is
the
only
theory
that
builds
this
case
out
in
the
good
direction
and
this
case
stands
for
innumerable
other
kinds
of
case
in
all
such
eases
odd
as
it
may
sound
our
judgment
may
actually
be
said
to
retroact
and
to
enrich
the
past
our
judgments
at
any
rate
change
the
character
of
future
reality
by
the
acts
to
which
they
lead
where
these
acts
are
acts
expressive
of
trust
trust
that
a
man
is
honest
that
our
health
is
good
enough
or
that
we
can
make
a
successful
effort
which
acts
may
be
a
needed
antecedent
of
the
trusted
things
becoming
true
professor
taylor
says
footnote
in
an
article
criticising
pragmatism
as
he
conceives
it
in
the
mcgill
university
quarterly
published
at
montreal
for
may
that
our
trust
is
at
any
rate
untrue
when
it
is
made
e
before
the
action
and
i
seem
to
remember
that
he
disposes
of
anything
like
a
faith
in
the
general
excellence
of
the
universe
making
the
faithful
person
part
in
it
at
any
rate
more
excellent
as
a
in
the
soul
but
the
pathos
of
this
expression
should
not
blind
us
to
the
complication
of
the
facts
i
doubt
whether
professor
taylor
would
himself
be
in
favor
of
practically
handling
trusters
of
these
kinds
as
liars
future
and
present
really
mix
in
such
emergencies
and
one
can
always
escape
lies
in
them
by
using
hypothetic
forms
but
attitude
suggests
such
absurd
possibilities
of
practice
that
it
seems
to
me
to
illustrate
beautifully
how
the
conception
of
a
truth
that
shall
merely
register
a
standing
fixture
may
become
theoretic
truth
truth
of
passive
copying
sought
in
the
sole
interests
of
copying
as
such
not
because
copying
is
good
for
something
but
because
copying
ought
schlechthin
to
be
seems
if
you
look
at
it
coldly
to
be
an
almost
preposterous
ideal
why
should
the
universe
existing
in
itself
also
exist
in
copies
how
can
it
be
copied
in
the
solidity
of
its
objective
fulness
and
even
if
it
could
what
would
the
motive
be
the
hairs
of
your
head
are
numbered
doubtless
they
are
virtually
but
why
as
an
absolute
proposition
ought
the
number
to
become
copied
and
known
surely
knowing
is
only
one
way
of
interacting
with
reality
and
adding
to
its
effect
the
opponent
here
will
ask
not
the
knowing
of
truth
any
substantive
value
on
its
own
account
apart
from
the
collateral
advantages
it
may
bring
and
if
you
allow
theoretic
satisfactions
to
exist
at
all
do
they
not
crowd
the
collateral
satisfactions
out
of
house
and
home
and
must
not
pragmatism
go
into
bankruptcy
if
she
admits
them
at
all
the
destructive
force
of
such
talk
disappears
as
soon
as
we
use
words
concretely
instead
of
abstractly
and
ask
in
our
quality
of
good
pragmatists
just
what
the
famous
theoretic
needs
are
known
as
and
in
what
the
intellectual
satisfactions
consist
are
they
not
all
mere
matters
of
consistency
and
emphatically
not
of
consistency
between
an
absolute
reality
and
the
mind
copies
of
it
but
of
actually
felt
consistency
among
judgments
objects
and
habits
of
reacting
in
the
mind
own
experienceable
world
and
are
not
both
our
need
of
such
consistency
and
our
pleasure
in
it
conceivable
as
outcomes
of
the
natural
fact
that
we
are
beings
that
do
develop
mental
habits
habit
itself
proving
adaptively
beneficial
in
an
environment
where
the
same
objects
or
the
same
kinds
of
objects
recur
and
follow
if
this
were
so
what
would
have
come
first
would
have
been
the
collateral
profits
of
habit
as
such
and
the
theoretic
life
would
have
grown
up
in
aid
of
these
in
point
of
fact
this
seems
to
have
been
the
probable
case
at
life
origin
any
present
perception
may
have
been
if
such
a
word
could
then
be
applicable
later
when
reactions
became
organized
the
reactions
became
whenever
expectation
was
fulfilled
by
them
otherwise
they
were
or
reactions
but
the
same
class
of
objects
needs
the
same
kind
of
reaction
so
the
impulse
to
react
consistently
must
gradually
have
been
established
and
a
disappointment
felt
whenever
the
results
frustrated
expectation
here
is
a
perfectly
plausible
germ
for
all
our
higher
consistencies
nowadays
if
an
object
claims
from
us
a
reaction
of
the
kind
habitually
accorded
only
to
the
opposite
class
of
objects
our
mental
machinery
refuses
to
run
smoothly
the
situation
is
intellectually
unsatisfactory
theoretic
truth
thus
falls
within
the
mind
being
the
accord
of
some
of
its
processes
and
objects
with
other
processes
and
objects
consisting
here
in
relations
so
long
as
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
such
an
accord
is
denied
us
whatever
collateral
profits
may
seem
to
inure
from
what
we
believe
in
are
but
as
dust
in
the
balance
provided
always
that
we
are
highly
organized
intellectually
which
the
majority
of
us
are
not
the
amount
of
accord
which
satisfies
most
men
and
women
is
merely
the
absence
of
violent
clash
between
their
usual
thoughts
and
statements
and
the
limited
sphere
of
in
which
their
lives
are
cast
the
theoretic
truth
that
most
of
us
think
we
to
attain
to
is
thus
the
possession
of
a
set
of
predicates
that
do
not
explicitly
contradict
their
subjects
we
preserve
it
as
often
as
not
by
leaving
other
predicates
and
subjects
out
in
some
men
theory
is
a
passion
just
as
music
is
in
others
the
form
of
inner
consistency
is
pursued
far
beyond
the
line
at
which
collateral
profits
stop
such
men
systematize
and
classify
and
schematize
and
make
synoptical
tables
and
invent
ideal
objects
for
the
pure
love
of
unifying
too
often
the
results
glowing
with
for
the
inventors
seem
pathetically
personal
and
artificial
to
bystanders
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
the
purely
theoretic
criterion
of
truth
can
leave
us
in
the
lurch
as
easily
as
any
other
criterion
and
that
the
absolutists
for
all
their
pretensions
are
the
same
boat
concretely
with
those
whom
they
attack
i
am
well
aware
that
this
paper
has
been
rambling
in
the
extreme
but
the
whole
subject
is
inductive
and
sharp
logic
is
hardly
yet
in
order
my
great
trammel
has
been
the
of
any
definitely
stated
alternative
on
my
opponents
part
it
may
conduce
to
clearness
if
i
recapitulate
in
closing
what
i
conceive
the
main
points
of
humanism
to
be
they
are
these
an
experience
perceptual
or
conceptual
must
conform
to
reality
in
order
to
be
true
by
humanism
means
nothing
more
than
the
other
conceptual
or
perceptual
experiences
with
which
a
given
present
experience
may
find
itself
in
point
of
fact
mixed
up

this
is
meant
merely
to
exclude
reality
of
an
sort
of
which
no
account
in
either
perceptual
or
conceptual
terms
can
be
given
it
includes
of
course
any
amount
if
empirical
reality
independent
of
the
knower
pragmatism
is
thus
realistic
in
its
account
by
humanism
means
taking
in
such
a
way
as
to
gain
any
intellectually
and
practically
satisfactory
result
to
and
to
be
are
terms
that
admit
of
no
definition
so
many
are
the
ways
in
which
these
requirements
can
practically
be
worked
out
vaguely
and
in
general
we
take
account
of
a
reality
by
preserving
it
in
as
unmodified
a
form
as
possible
but
to
be
then
satisfactory
it
must
not
contradict
other
realities
outside
of
it
which
claim
also
to
be
preserved
that
we
must
preserve
all
the
experience
we
can
and
minimize
contradiction
in
what
we
preserve
is
about
all
that
can
be
said
in
advance
the
truth
which
the
conforming
experience
embodies
may
be
a
positive
addition
to
the
previous
reality
and
later
judgments
may
have
to
conform
to

i
have
treated
of
type
the
kind
of
knowledge
called
perception
in
an
article
in
the
journal
of
philosophy
for
september
called
consciousness
exist
this
is
the
type
of
case
in
which
the
mind
enjoys
direct
with
a
present
object
in
the
other
types
the
mind
has
an
object
not
immediately
there
type
can
always
formally
and
hypothetically
be
reduced
to
type
so
that
a
brief
description
of
that
type
will
now
put
the
present
reader
sufficiently
at
my
point
of
view
and
make
him
see
what
the
actual
meanings
of
the
mysterious
cognitive
relation
may
be
suppose
me
to
be
sitting
here
in
my
library
at
cambridge
at
ten
minutes
walk
from
hall
and
to
be
thinking
truly
of
the
latter
object
my
mind
may
have
before
it
only
the
name
or
it
may
have
a
clear
image
or
it
may
have
a
very
dim
image
of
the
hall
but
such
an
intrinsic
difference
in
the
image
makes
no
difference
in
its
cognitive
function
certain
extrinsic
phenomena
special
experiences
of
conjunction
are
what
impart
to
the
image
be
it
what
it
may
its
knowing
office
for
instance
if
you
ask
me
what
hall
i
mean
by
my
image
and
i
can
tell
you
nothing
or
if
i
fail
to
point
or
lead
you
towards
the
harvard
delta
or
if
being
led
by
you
i
am
uncertain
whether
the
hall
i
see
be
what
i
had
in
mind
or
not
you
would
rightly
deny
that
i
had
that
particular
hall
at
all
even
tho
my
mental
image
might
to
some
degree
have
resembled
it
the
resemblance
would
count
in
that
case
as
coincidental
merely
for
all
sorts
of
things
of
a
kind
resemble
one
another
in
this
world
without
being
held
for
that
reason
to
take
cognizance
of
one
another
on
the
other
hand
if
i
can
lead
you
to
the
hall
and
tell
you
of
its
history
and
present
uses
if
in
its
presence
i
feel
my
idea
however
imperfect
it
may
have
been
to
have
led
hither
and
to
be
now
terminated
if
the
associates
of
the
image
and
of
the
felt
hall
run
parallel
so
that
each
term
of
the
one
context
corresponds
serially
as
i
walk
with
an
answering
term
of
the
other
why
then
my
soul
was
prophetic
and
my
idea
must
be
and
by
common
consent
would
be
called
cognizant
of
reality
that
percept
was
what
i
meant
for
into
it
my
idea
has
passed
by
conjunctive
experiences
of
sameness
and
fulfilled
intention
nowhere
is
there
jar
but
every
later
moment
continues
and
corroborates
an
earlier
one
in
this
continuing
and
corroborating
taken
in
no
transcendental
sense
but
denoting
definitely
felt
transitions
lies
all
that
the
knowing
of
a
percept
by
an
idea
can
possibly
contain
or
signify
wherever
such
transitions
are
felt
the
first
experience
knows
the
last
one
where
they
do
not
or
where
even
as
possibles
they
can
not
intervene
there
can
be
no
pretence
of
knowing
in
this
latter
case
the
extremes
will
be
connected
if
connected
at
all
by
inferior
relations
bare
likeness
or
succession
or
by
alone
knowledge
of
sensible
realities
thus
comes
to
life
inside
the
tissue
of
experience
it
is
made
and
made
by
relations
that
unroll
themselves
in
time
whenever
certain
intermediaries
are
given
such
that
as
they
develop
towards
their
terminus
there
is
experience
from
point
to
point
of
one
direction
followed
and
finally
of
one
process
fulfilled
the
result
is
that
their
thereby
becomes
a
knower
and
their
terminus
an
object
meant
or
known
that
is
all
that
knowing
in
the
simple
case
considered
can
be
that
is
the
whole
of
its
nature
put
into
experiential
terms
whenever
such
is
the
sequence
of
our
experiences
we
may
freely
say
that
we
had
the
terminal
object
mind
from
the
outset
even
altho
at
the
outset
nothing
was
there
in
us
but
a
flat
piece
of
substantive
experience
like
any
other
with
no
about
it
and
no
mystery
save
the
mystery
of
coming
into
existence
and
of
being
gradually
followed
by
other
pieces
of
substantive
experience
with
conjunctively
transitional
experiences
between
that
is
what
we
mean
here
by
the
object
being
mind
of
any
deeper
more
real
way
of
its
being
in
mind
we
have
no
positive
conception
and
we
have
no
right
to
discredit
our
actual
experience
by
talking
of
such
a
way
at
all
i
know
that
many
a
reader
will
rebel
at
this
intermediaries
he
will
say
tho
they
be
feelings
of
continuously
growing
fulfilment
only
separate
the
knower
from
the
known
whereas
what
we
have
in
knowledge
is
a
kind
of
immediate
touch
of
the
one
by
the
other
an
apprehension
in
the
etymological
sense
of
the
word
a
leaping
of
the
chasm
as
by
lightning
an
act
by
which
two
terms
are
smitten
into
one
over
the
head
of
their
distinctness
all
these
dead
intermediaries
of
yours
are
out
of
each
other
and
outside
of
their
termini
still
but
do
not
such
dialectic
difficulties
remind
us
of
the
dog
dropping
his
bone
and
snapping
at
its
image
in
the
water
if
we
knew
any
more
real
kind
of
union
aliunde
we
might
be
entitled
to
brand
all
our
empirical
unions
as
a
sham
but
unions
by
continuous
transition
are
the
only
ones
we
know
of
whether
in
this
matter
of
a
that
terminates
in
an
acquaintance
whether
in
personal
identity
in
logical
prediction
through
the
copula
or
elsewhere
if
anywhere
there
were
more
absolute
unions
they
could
only
reveal
themselves
to
us
by
just
such
conjunctive
results
these
are
what
the
unions
are
worth
these
are
all
that
we
can
ever
practically
mean
by
union
by
continuity
is
it
not
time
to
repeat
what
lotze
said
of
substances
that
to
act
like
one
is
to
be
one
should
we
not
say
here
that
to
be
experienced
as
continuous
is
to
be
really
continuous
in
a
world
where
experience
and
reality
come
to
the
same
thing
in
a
picture
gallery
a
painted
hook
will
serve
to
hang
a
painted
chain
by
a
painted
cable
will
hold
a
painted
ship
in
a
world
where
both
the
terms
and
their
distinctions
are
affairs
of
experience
conjunctions
that
are
experienced
must
be
at
least
as
real
as
anything
else
they
will
be
real
conjunctions
if
we
have
no
transphenomenal
absolute
ready
to
derealize
the
whole
experienced
world
by
at
a
stroke
so
much
for
the
essentials
of
the
cognitive
relation
where
the
knowledge
is
conceptual
in
type
or
forms
knowledge
an
object
it
consists
in
intermediary
experiences
possible
if
not
actual
of
continuously
developing
progress
and
finally
of
fulfilment
when
the
sensible
percept
which
is
the
object
is
reached
the
percept
here
not
only
verifies
the
concept
proves
its
function
of
knowing
that
percept
to
be
true
but
the
percept
existence
as
the
terminus
of
the
chain
of
intermediaries
creates
the
function
whatever
terminates
that
chain
was
because
it
now
proves
itself
to
be
what
the
concept
in
mind
the
towering
importance
for
human
life
of
this
kind
of
knowing
lies
in
the
tact
that
an
experience
that
knows
another
can
figure
as
its
representative
not
in
any
sense
but
in
the
definite
practical
sense
of
being
its
substitute
in
various
operations
sometimes
physical
and
sometimes
mental
which
lead
us
to
its
associates
and
results
by
experimenting
on
our
ideas
of
reality
we
may
save
ourselves
the
trouble
of
experimenting
on
the
real
experiences
which
they
severally
mean
the
ideas
form
related
systems
corresponding
point
for
point
to
the
systems
which
the
realities
form
and
by
letting
an
ideal
term
call
up
its
associates
systematically
we
may
be
led
to
a
terminus
which
the
corresponding
real
term
would
have
led
to
in
case
we
had
operated
on
the
real
world
and
this
brings
us
to
the
general
question
of
substitution
what
exactly
in
a
system
of
experiences
does
the
of
one
of
them
for
another
mean
according
to
my
view
experience
as
a
whole
is
a
process
in
time
whereby
innumerable
particular
terms
lapse
and
are
superseded
by
others
that
follow
upon
them
by
transitions
which
whether
disjunctive
or
conjunctive
in
content
are
themselves
experiences
and
must
in
general
be
accounted
at
least
as
real
as
the
terms
which
they
relate
what
the
nature
of
the
event
called
signifies
depends
altogether
on
the
kind
of
transition
that
obtains
some
experiences
simply
abolish
their
predecessors
without
continuing
them
in
any
way
others
are
felt
to
increase
or
to
enlarge
their
meaning
to
carry
out
their
purpose
or
to
bring
us
nearer
to
their
goal
they
them
and
may
fulfil
their
function
better
than
they
fulfilled
it
themselves
but
to
a
function
in
a
world
of
pure
experience
can
be
conceived
and
defined
in
only
one
possible
way
in
such
a
world
transitions
and
arrivals
or
terminations
are
the
only
events
that
happen
tho
they
happen
by
so
many
sorts
of
path
the
only
function
that
one
experience
can
perform
is
to
lead
into
another
experience
and
the
only
fulfilment
we
can
speak
of
is
the
reaching
of
a
certain
experienced
end
when
one
experience
leads
to
or
can
lead
to
the
same
end
as
another
they
agree
in
function
but
the
whole
system
of
experiences
as
they
are
immediately
given
presents
itself
as
a
through
which
one
can
pass
out
of
an
initial
term
in
many
directions
and
yet
end
in
the
same
terminus
moving
from
next
to
next
by
a
great
many
possible
paths
either
one
of
these
paths
might
be
a
functional
substitute
for
another
and
to
follow
one
rather
than
another
might
on
occasion
be
an
advantageous
thing
to
do
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
in
a
general
way
the
paths
that
run
through
conceptual
experiences
that
is
through
or
that
the
things
in
which
they
terminate
are
highly
advantageous
paths
to
follow
not
only
do
they
yield
inconceivably
rapid
transitions
but
owing
to
the
character
footnote
of
which
all
that
need
be
said
in
this
essay
is
that
it
also
an
be
conceived
as
functional
and
defined
in
terms
of
transitions
or
of
the
possibility
of
such
which
they
frequently
possess
and
to
their
capacity
for
association
with
one
another
in
great
systems
they
outstrip
the
tardy
consecutions
of
the
things
themselves
and
sweep
us
on
towards
our
ultimate
termini
in
a
far
more
way
than
the
following
of
trains
of
sensible
perception
ever
could
wonderful
are
the
new
cuts
and
the
the
make
most
it
is
true
are
substitutes
for
nothing
actual
they
end
outside
the
real
world
altogether
in
wayward
fancies
utopias
fictions
or
mistakes
but
where
they
do
reality
and
terminate
therein
we
substitute
them
always
and
with
these
substitutes
we
pass
the
greater
number
of
our
hours
footnote
this
is
why
i
called
our
experiences
taken
all
together
a
there
is
vastly
more
discontinuity
in
the
sum
total
of
experiences
than
we
commonly
suppose
the
objective
nucleus
of
every
man
experience
his
own
body
is
it
is
true
a
continuous
percept
and
equally
continuous
as
a
percept
though
we
may
be
inattentive
to
it
is
the
material
environment
of
that
body
changing
by
gradual
transition
when
the
body
moves
but
the
distant
parts
of
the
physical
world
are
at
all
times
absent
from
us
and
form
conceptual
objects
merely
into
the
perceptual
reality
of
which
our
life
inserts
itself
at
points
discrete
and
relatively
rare
round
their
several
objective
nuclei
partly
shared
and
common
partly
discrete
of
the
real
physical
world
innumerable
thinkers
pursuing
their
several
lines
of
physically
true
cogitation
trace
paths
that
intersect
one
another
only
at
discontinuous
perceptual
points
and
the
rest
of
the
time
are
quite
incongruent
and
around
all
the
nuclei
of
shared
floats
the
vast
cloud
of
experiences
that
are
wholly
subjective
that
are
that
find
not
even
an
eventual
ending
for
themselves
in
the
perceptual
world
the
mere
and
joys
and
sufferings
and
wishes
of
the
individual
minds
these
exist
with
one
another
indeed
and
with
the
objective
nuclei
but
out
of
them
it
is
probable
that
to
all
eternity
no
system
of
any
kind
will
ever
be
made
whosoever
feels
his
experience
to
be
something
substitutional
even
while
he
has
it
may
be
said
to
have
an
experience
that
reaches
beyond
itself
from
inside
of
its
own
entity
it
says
and
postulates
reality
existing
elsewhere
for
the
transcendentalist
who
holds
knowing
to
consist
in
a
salto
motale
across
an
chasm
such
an
idea
presents
no
difficulty
but
it
seems
at
first
sight
as
if
it
might
be
inconsistent
with
an
empiricism
like
our
own
have
we
not
explained
that
conceptual
knowledge
is
made
such
wholly
by
the
existence
of
things
that
fall
outside
of
the
knowing
experience
itself
by
intermediary
experiences
and
by
a
terminus
that
fulfils
can
the
knowledge
be
there
before
these
elements
that
constitute
its
being
have
come
and
if
knowledge
be
not
there
how
can
objective
reference
occur
the
key
to
this
difficulty
lies
in
the
distinction
between
knowing
as
verified
and
completed
and
the
same
knowing
as
in
transit
and
on
its
way
to
recur
to
the
memorial
hall
example
lately
used
it
is
only
when
our
idea
of
the
hall
has
actually
terminated
in
the
percept
that
we
know
certain
that
from
the
beginning
it
was
truly
cognitive
of
that
until
established
by
the
end
of
the
process
its
quality
of
knowing
that
or
indeed
of
knowing
anything
could
still
be
doubted
and
yet
the
knowing
really
was
there
as
the
result
now
shows
we
were
virtual
knowers
of
the
hall
long
before
we
were
certified
to
have
been
its
actual
knowers
by
the
percept
retroactive
validating
power
just
so
we
are
all
the
time
by
reason
of
the
virtuality
of
the
inevitable
event
which
will
make
us
so
when
it
shall
have
come
now
the
immensely
greater
part
of
all
our
knowing
never
gets
beyond
this
virtual
stage
it
never
is
completed
or
nailed
down
i
speak
not
merely
of
our
ideas
of
imperceptibles
like
or
dissociated
or
of
like
the
contents
of
our
neighbors
minds
i
speak
also
of
ideas
which
we
might
verify
if
we
would
take
the
trouble
but
which
we
hold
for
true
altho
unterminated
perceptually
because
nothing
says
to
us
and
there
is
no
contradicting
truth
in
sight
to
continue
thinking
unchallenged
is
times
out
of
a
hundred
our
practical
substitute
for
knowing
in
the
completed
sense
as
each
experience
runs
by
cognitive
transition
into
the
next
one
and
we
nowhere
feel
a
collision
with
what
we
elsewhere
count
as
truth
or
fact
we
commit
ourselves
to
the
current
as
if
the
port
were
sure
we
live
as
it
were
upon
the
front
edge
of
an
advancing
and
our
sense
of
a
determinate
direction
in
falling
forward
is
all
we
cover
of
the
future
of
our
path
it
is
as
if
a
differential
quotient
should
be
conscious
and
treat
itself
as
an
adequate
substitute
for
a
curve
our
experience
inter
alia
is
of
variations
of
rate
and
of
direction
and
lives
in
these
transitions
more
than
in
the
end
the
experiences
of
tendency
are
sufficient
to
act
upon
what
more
could
we
have
done
at
those
moments
even
if
the
later
verification
comes
complete
this
is
what
as
a
radical
empiricist
i
say
to
the
charge
that
the
objective
reference
which
is
so
flagrant
a
character
of
our
experiences
involves
a
chasm
and
a
mortal
leap
a
positively
conjunctive
transition
involves
neither
chasm
nor
leap
being
the
very
original
of
what
we
mean
by
continuity
it
makes
a
continuum
wherever
it
appears
objective
reference
is
an
incident
of
the
fact
that
so
much
of
our
experience
comes
as
an
insufficient
and
consists
of
process
and
transition
our
fields
of
experience
have
no
more
definite
boundaries
than
have
our
fields
of
view
both
are
fringed
forever
by
a
more
that
continuously
develops
and
that
continuously
supersedes
them
as
life
proceeds
the
relations
generally
speaking
are
as
real
here
as
the
terms
are
and
the
only
complaint
of
the
transcendentalist
with
which
i
could
at
all
sympathize
would
be
his
charge
that
by
first
making
knowledge
to
consist
in
external
relations
as
i
have
done
and
by
then
confessing
that
of
the
time
these
are
not
actually
but
only
virtually
there
i
have
knocked
the
solid
bottom
out
of
the
whole
business
and
palmed
off
a
substitute
of
knowledge
for
the
genuine
thing
only
the
admission
such
a
critic
might
say
that
our
ideas
are
and
already
in
advance
of
the
experiences
that
are
to
terminate
them
can
bring
solidity
back
to
knowledge
in
a
world
like
this
in
which
transitions
and
terminations
are
only
by
exception
fulfilled
this
seems
to
me
an
excellent
place
for
applying
the
pragmatic
method
what
would
the
affirmed
to
exist
in
advance
of
all
experiential
mediation
or
termination
be
what
would
it
practically
result
in
for
us
were
it
true
it
could
only
result
in
our
orientation
in
the
turning
of
our
expectations
and
practical
tendencies
into
the
right
path
and
the
right
path
here
so
long
as
we
and
the
object
are
not
yet
face
to
face
or
can
never
get
face
to
face
as
in
the
case
of
ejects
would
be
the
path
that
led
us
into
the
object
nearest
neighborhood
where
direct
acquaintance
is
lacking
about
is
the
next
best
thing
and
an
acquaintance
with
what
actually
lies
about
the
and
is
most
closely
related
to
it
puts
such
knowledge
within
our
grasp
and
your
anger
for
example
are
things
in
which
my
thoughts
will
never
percteptually
terminate
but
my
concepts
of
them
lead
me
to
their
very
brink
to
the
chromatic
fringes
and
to
the
hurtful
words
and
deeds
which
are
their
really
next
effects
even
if
our
ideas
did
in
themselves
possess
the
postulated
it
would
still
remain
true
that
their
putting
us
into
possession
of
such
effects
would
be
the
sole
of
the
for
us
and
this
it
is
needless
to
say
is
verbatim
et
liberatim
what
our
empiricist
account
pays
in
on
pragmatist
principles
therefore
a
dispute
over
is
a
pure
logomachy
call
our
concepts
of
ejective
things
or
the
reverse
it
makes
no
difference
so
long
as
we
do
differ
about
the
nature
of
that
exalted
virtue
fruits
fruits
for
us
of
course
humanistic
fruits
the
transcendentalist
believes
his
ideas
to
be
only
because
he
finds
that
in
fact
they
do
bear
fruits
why
need
he
quarrel
with
an
account
of
knowledge
that
insists
on
naming
this
effect
why
not
treat
the
working
of
the
idea
from
next
to
next
as
the
essence
of
its
why
insist
that
knowing
is
a
static
relation
out
of
time
when
it
practically
seems
so
much
a
function
of
our
active
life
for
a
thing
to
be
valid
says
lotze
is
the
same
as
to
make
itself
valid
when
the
whole
universe
seems
only
to
be
making
itself
valid
and
to
be
still
incomplete
else
why
its
ceaseless
changing
why
of
all
things
should
knowing
be
exempt
why
should
it
not
be
making
itself
valid
like
everything
else
that
some
parts
of
it
may
be
already
valid
or
verified

no

humanism
is
a
ferment
that
has
to
stay
it
is
not
a
single
hypothesis
or
theorem
and
it
dwells
on
no
new
facts
it
is
rather
a
slow
shifting
in
the
philosophic
perspective
making
things
appear
as
from
a
new
centre
of
interest
or
point
of
sight
some
writers
are
strongly
conscious
of
the
shifting
others
half
unconscious
even
though
their
own
vision
may
have
undergone
much
change
the
result
is
no
small
confusion
in

to

only
a
few
if
such
pervasive
consequences
be

it
is
clear
that
no

may
take
first
in
defining
it
and
then
in
furthering

suffers
badly
at

from
incomplete
definition
its
most
systematic
advocates
schiller

dewey
have
published
fragmentary
programmes
only
and
its
bearing
on
many
vital
philosophic
problems
has
not
been
traced
except
by
adversaries
who
scenting
heresies
in
advance
have
showered
blows
on
doctrines
subjectivism
and
scepticism
for
example
that
no
good
humanist
finds
it
necessary
to
entertain
by
their
still
greater
reticences
the
have
in
turn
perplexed
the
humanists
much
of
the
controversy
has
involved
the
word
it
is
always
good
in
debate
to
know
your
adversary
point
of
view
authentically
but
the
critics
of
humanism
never
define
exactly
what
the
word
signifies
when
they
use
it
themselves
the
humanists
have
to
guess
at
their
view
and
the
result
has
doubtless
been
much
beating
of
the
air
add
to
all
this
great
individual
differences
in
both
camps
and
it
becomes
clear
that
nothing
is
so
urgently
needed
at
the
stage
which
things
have
reached
at
present
as
a
sharper
definition
by
each
side
of
its
central
point
of
view
whoever
will
contribute
any
touch
of
sharpness
will
help
us
to
make
sure
of
what
what
and
who
is
who
any
one
can
contribute
such
a
definition
and
without
it
no
one
knows
exactly
where
he
stands
if
i
offer
my
own
provisional
definition
of
humanism
now
and
here
others
may
improve
it
some
adversary
may
be
led
to
define
his
own
creed
more
sharply
by
the
contrast
and
a
certain
quickening
of
the
crystallization
of
general
opinion
may
result
the
essential
service
of
humanism
as
i
conceive
the
situation
is
to
have
seen
that
tho
one
part
of
our
experience
may
lean
upon
another
part
to
make
it
what
it
is
in
any
one
of
several
aspects
in
which
it
may
be
considered
experience
as
a
whole
is
and
leans
on
nothing
since
this
formula
also
expresses
the
main
contention
of
transcendental
idealism
it
needs
abundant
explication
to
make
it
unambiguous
it
seems
at
first
sight
to
confine
itself
to
denying
theism
and
pantheism
but
in
fact
it
need
not
deny
either
everything
would
depend
on
the
exegesis
and
if
the
formula
ever
became
canonical
it
would
certainly
develop
both
and
interpreters
i
myself
read
humanism
theistically
and
pluralistically
if
there
be
a
god
he
is
no
absolute
but
simply
the
experiencer
of
widest
actual
conscious
span
read
thus
humanism
is
for
me
a
religion
susceptible
of
reasoned
defence
tho
i
am
well
aware
how
many
minds
there
are
to
whom
it
can
appeal
religiously
only
when
it
has
been
monistically
translated
ethically
the
pluralistic
form
of
it
takes
for
me
a
stronger
hold
on
reality
than
any
other
philosophy
i
know
of
it
being
essentially
a
social
philosophy
a
philosophy
of
in
which
conjunctions
do
the
work
but
my
primary
reason
for
advocating
it
is
its
matchless
intellectual
economy
it
gets
rid
not
only
of
the
standing
that
monism
engenders
of
evil
of
freedom
and
the
like
but
of
other
metaphysical
mysteries
and
paradoxes
as
well
it
gets
rid
for
example
of
the
whole
agnostic
controversy
by
refusing
to
entertain
the
hypothesis
of
reality
at
all
it
gets
rid
of
any
need
for
an
absolute
of
the
bradleyan
type
avowedly
sterile
for
intellectual
purposes
by
insisting
that
the
conjunctive
relations
found
within
experience
are
faultlessly
real
it
gets
rid
of
the
need
of
an
absolute
of
the
roycean
type
similarly
sterile
by
its
pragmatic
treatment
of
the
problem
of
knowledge
as
the
views
of
knowledge
reality
and
truth
imputed
to
humanism
have
been
those
so
far
most
fiercely
attacked
it
is
in
regard
to
these
ideas
that
a
sharpening
of
focus
seems
most
urgently
required
i
proceed
therefore
to
bring
the
views
which
i
impute
to
humanism
in
these
respects
into
focus
as
briefly
as
i
can
ii
if
the
central
humanistic
thesis
printed
above
in
italics
be
accepted
it
will
follow
that
if
there
be
any
such
thing
at
all
as
knowing
the
knower
and
the
object
known
must
both
be
portions
of
experience
one
part
of
experience
must
therefore
either
know
another
part
of
experience
in
other
words
parts
must
as

represent
one
another
instead
of
representing
realities
outside

case

that
of
conceptual
knowledge

else
they
must
simply
exist
as
so
many
ultimate
thats
or
facts
of
being
in
the
first
instance
and
then
as
a
secondary
complication
and
without
doubling
up
its
entitative
singleness
any
one
and
the
same
that
in
experience
must
figure
alternately
as
a
thing
known
and
as
a
knowledge
of
the
thing
by
reason
of
two
divergent
kinds
of
context
into
which
in
the
general
course
of
experience
it
gets
woven

this
second
case
is
that
of
there
is
a
stage
of
thought
that
goes
beyond
common
sense
and
of
it
i
shall
say
more
presently
but
the
stage
is
a
perfectly
definite
of
thought
primarily
for
purposes
of
action
and
so
long
as
we
remain
on
the
stage
of
thought
object
and
subject
fuse
in
the
fact
of
or
pen
and
hand
which
i
now
see
writing
for
example
are
the
physical
realities
which
those
words
designate
in
this
case
there
is
no
implied
in
the
knowing
humanism
here
is
only
a
more
comminuted
identitatsphilosophie
in
case
on
the
contrary
the
representative
experience
does
transcend
itself
in
knowing
the
other
experience
that
is
its
object
no
one
can
talk
of
the
knowledge
of
the
one
by
the
other
without
seeing
them
as
numerically
distinct
entities
of
which
the
one
lies
beyond
the
other
and
away
from
it
along
some
direction
and
with
some
interval
that
can
be
definitely
named
but
if
the
talker
be
a
humanist
he
must
also
see
this
concretely
and
pragmatically
and
confess
it
to
consist
of
other
intervening
experiences
of
possible
ones
at
all
events
if
not
of
actual
to
call
my
present
idea
of
my
dog
for
example
cognitive
of
the
real
dog
means
that
as
the
actual
tissue
of
experience
is
constituted
the
idea
is
capable
of
leading
into
a
chain
of
other
experiences
on
my
part
that
go
from
next
to
next
and
terminate
at
last
in
vivid
of
a
jumping
barking
hairy
body
those
are
the
real
dog
the
dog
full
presence
for
my
common
sense
if
the
supposed
talker
is
a
profound
philosopher
altho
they
may
not
be
the
real
dog
for
him
they
mean
the
real
dog
are
practical
substitutes
for
the
real
dog
as
the
representation
was
a
practical
substitute
for
them
that
real
dog
being
a
lot
of
atoms

or
of
that
lie
where
the
lie
in
his
experience
as
well
as
in
my
own
iii
the
philosopher
here
stands
for
the
stage
of
thought
that
goes
beyond
the
stage
of
common
sense
and
the
difference
is
simply
that
he
and
where
common
sense
does
not
for
common
sense
two
men
see
the
same
identical
real
dog
philosophy
noting
actual
differences
in
their
perceptions
points
out
the
duality
of
these
latter
and
interpolates
something
between
them
as
a
more
real
terminus
first
organs
viscera
etc
next
cells
then
ultimate
atoms
lastly
perhaps
the
original
of
the
two
men
instead
of
coalescing
with
each
other
and
with
the
real
as
at
first
supposed
are
thus
held
by
philosophers
to
be
separated
by
invisible
realities
with
which
at
most
they
are

regarded
by
the
philosopher
as
not
quite
reaching
reality
he
has
only
carried
the
procession
of
experiences
the
philosopher
thinks
to
a
definite
because
practical
somewhere
on
the
way
towards
an
absolute
truth
that
lies
beyond
the
humanist
sees
all
the
time
however
that
there
is
no
absolute
transcendency
even
about
the
more
absolute
realities
thus
conjectured

believed
in
the

are
only
possible
percepts
following
upon
that

the

we
may
never
attain
to
human
means
of
perceiving
them
are
still
defined
perceptually
the
itself
is
conceived
as
a
kind
of
experience
and
it
is
possible
to
frame
the
hypothesis
such
hypotheses
can
by
no
logic
be
excluded
from
philosophy
of
two
knowers
of
a
piece
of
and
the
itself
becoming
at
the
moment
at
which
our
imperfect
knowing
might
pass
into
knowing
of
a
completed
type
even
so
do
you
and
i
habitually
conceive
our
two
perceptions
and
the
real
dog
as
confluent
tho
only
provisionally
and
for
the
stage
of
thought
if
my
pen
be
inwardly
made
of
there
is
no
confluence
now
between
that
and
my
visual
perception
of
the
pen
but
conceivably
there
might
come
to
be
such
confluence
for
in
the
case
of
my
hand
the
visual
sensations
and
the
inward
feelings
of
the
hand
its
so
to
speak
are
even
now
as
confluent
as
any
two
things
can
be
there
is
thus
no
breach
in
humanistic
epistemology
whether
knowledge
be
taken
as
ideally
perfected
or
only
as
true
enough
to
pass
muster
for
practice
it
is
hung
on
one
continuous
scheme
reality
howsoever
remote
is
always
defined
as
a
terminus
within
the
general
possibilities
of
experience
and
what
knows
it
is
defined
as
an
experience
that
it
in
the
sense
of
being
substitutable
for
it
in
our
thinking
because
it
leads
to
the
same
associates
or
in
the
sense
of
to
it
through
a
chain
of
other
experiences
that
either
intervene
or
may
intervene
absolute
reality
here
bears
the
same
relation
to
sensation
as
sensation
bears
to
conception
or
imagination
both
are
provisional
or
final
termini
sensation
being
only
the
terminus
at
which
the
practical
man
habitually
stops
while
the
philosopher
projects
a
in
the
shape
of
more
absolute
reality
these
termini
for
the
practical
and
the
philosophical
stages
of
thought
respectively
are
they
are
not
of
anything
else
they
simply
are
are
real
they
on
nothing
as
my
italicized
formula
said
rather
does
the
whole
fabric
of
experience
lean
on
them
just
as
the
whole
fabric
of
the
solar
system
including
many
relative
positions
leans
for
its
absolute
position
in
space
on
any
one
of
its
constituent
stars

one
gets
a
new
identitatsphilosophie

pluralistic
form

if
i
have
succeeded
in
making
this
at
all
clear
tho
i
fear
that
brevity
and
abstractness
between
them
may
have
made
me
fail
the
reader
will
see
that
the
of
our
mental
operations
must
always
be
an
affair
a
conception
is
reckoned
true
by
common
sense
when
it
can
be
made
to
lead
to
a
sensation
the
sensation
which
for
common
sense
is
not
so
much
as
is
held
to
be
provisionally
true
by
the
philosopher
just
in
so
far
as
it
covers
abuts
at
or
occupies
the
place
of
a
still
more
absolutely
real
experience
in
the
possibility
of
which
to
some
remoter
experient
the
philosopher
finds
reason
to
believe
meanwhile
what
actually
does
count
for
true
to
any
individual
trower
whether
he
be
philosopher
or
common
man
is
always
a
result
of
his
apperceptions
if
a
novel

or
sensible
contradict
too
emphatically
our
system
of
beliefs
in

out
of

is
treated
as

when
the
older
and

newer

what
we
treat
as

in
no

however
need

or
should
we
ever
reach
absolutely
terminal
experiences
experiences
in
which
we
all
agreed

were

by
no

these
would
not
be

they
would
be

they
would
simply
be

be
indeed
the
angles

which
the

they
harmoniously
lead

my

truth
seems
if
i
may
judge
by
what
i
hear

almost
complete
an
ordinary

feel
disheartened

a
common
choleric
sinner
would
curse
god
and
die
after
such
a
reception
but
instead
of
taking
counsel
of
despair
i
make
bold
to
vary
my
statements
in
the
faint
hope
that
repeated
droppings
may
wear
upon
the
stone
and
that
my
formulas
may
seem
less
obscure
if
surrounded
by
something
more

a
whereby
to
apperceive
them
for
fear
of
compromising
other
pragmatists

for
the
greenites
had
been
saltatory
for
me
they
became
thenceforward
ambulatory
now
the
most
general
way
of
contrasting
my
view
of
knowledge
with
the
popular
view
which
is
also
the
view
of
most
epistemologists
is
to
call
my
view
ambulatory
and
the
other
view
saltatory
and
the
most
general
way
of
characterizing
the
two
views
is
by
saying
that
my
view
describes
knowing
as
it
exists
concretely
while
the
other
view
only
describes
its
results
abstractly
taken
i
fear
that
most
of
my
recalcitrant
readers
fail
to
recognize
that
what
is
ambulatory
in
the
concrete
may
be
taken
so
abstractly
as
to
appear
saltatory
distance
for
example
is
made
abstract
by
emptying
out
whatever
is
particular
in
the
concrete
intervals
it
is
reduced
thus
to
a
sole
a
difference
of
which
is
a
logical
or
saltatory
distinction
a
relation
the
same
is
true
of
the
relation
called
which
may
connect
an
idea
with
a
reality
my
own
account
of
this
relation
is
ambulatory
through
and
through
i
say
that
we
know
an
object
by
means
of
an
idea
whenever
we
ambulate
towards
the
object
under
the
impulse
which
the
idea
communicates
if
we
believe
in
realities
the
idea
may
not
only
send
us
towards
its
object
but
may
put
the
latter
into
our
very
hand
make
it
our
immediate
sensation
but
if
as
most
reflective
people
opine
sensible
realities
are
not
realities
but
only
their
appearances
our
idea
brings
us
at
least
so
far
puts
us
in
touch
with
reality
most
authentic
appearances
and
substitutes
in
any
case
our
idea
brings
us
into
the
object
neighborhood
practical
or
ideal
gets
us
into
commerce
with
it
helps
us
towards
its
closer
acquaintance
enables
us
to
foresee
it
class
it
compare
it
deduce
it
in
short
to
deal
with
it
as
we
could
not
were
the
idea
not
in
our
possession
the
idea
is
thus
when
functionally
considered
an
instrument
for
enabling
us
the
better
to
have
to
do
with
the
object
and
to
act
about
it
but
it
and
the
object
are
both
of
them
bits
of
the
general
sheet
and
tissue
of
reality
at
large
and
when
we
say
that
the
idea
leads
us
towards
the
object
that
only
means
that
it
carries
us
forward
through
intervening
tracts
of
that
reality
into
the
object
closer
neighborhood
into
the
midst
of
its
associates
at
least
be
these
its
physical
neighbors
or
be
they
its
logical
congeners
only
thus
carried
into
closer
quarters
we
are
in
an
improved
situation
as
regards
acquaintance
and
conduct
and
we
say
that
through
the
idea
we
now
know
the
object
better
or
more
truly
my
thesis
is
that
the
knowing
here
is
made
by
the
ambulation
through
the
intervening
experiences
if
the
idea
led
us
nowhere
or
from
that
object
instead
of
towards
it
could
we
talk
at
all
of
its
having
any
cognitive
quality
surely
not
for
it
is
only
when
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
intermediate
experiences
that
it
gets
related
to
that
particular
object
rather
than
to
any
other
part
of
nature
those
intermediaries
determine
what
particular
knowing
function
it
exerts
the
terminus
they
guide
us
to
tells
us
what
object
it
the
results
they
enrich
us
with
or
it
intervening
experiences
are
thus
as
indispensable
foundations
for
a
concrete
relation
of
cognition
as
intervening
space
is
for
a
relation
of
distance
cognition
whenever
we
take
it
concretely
means
determinate
through
intermediaries
from
a
terminus
a
quo
to
or
towards
a
terminus
ad
quem
as
the
intermediaries
are
other
than
the
termini
and
connected
with
them
by
the
usual
associative
bonds
be
these
or
be
they
logical
classificatory
in
character
there
would
appear
to
be
nothing
especially
unique
about
the
processes
of
knowing
they
fall
wholly
within
experience
and
we
need
use
in
describing
them
no
other
categories
than
those
which
we
employ
in
describing
other
natural
processes
but
there
exist
no
processes
which
we
can
not
also
consider
abstractly
eviscerating
them
down
to
their
essential
skeletons
or
outlines
and
when
we
have
treated
the
processes
of
knowing
thus
we
are
easily
led
to
regard
them
as
something
altogether
unparalleled
in
nature
for
we
first
empty
idea
object
and
intermediaries
of
all
their
particularities
in
order
to
retain
only
a
general
scheme
and
then
we
consider
the
latter
only
in
its
function
of
giving
a
result
and
not
in
its
character
of
being
a
process
in
this
treatment
the
intermediaries
shrivel
into
the
form
of
a
mere
space
of
separation
while
the
idea
and
object
retain
only
the
logical
distinctness
of
being
the
that
are
separated
in
other
words
the
intermediaries
which
in
their
concrete
particularity
form
a
bridge
evaporate
ideally
into
an
empty
interval
to
cross
and
then
the
relation
of
the
having
become
saltatory
the
whole
of
erkenntnistheorie
begins
and
goes
on
unrestrained
by
further
concrete
considerations
the
idea
in
an
object
separated
by
an
chasm
from
itself
now
executes
what
professor
ladd
calls
a
mortale
in
knowing
the
object
nature
it
now
its
own
the
object
in
turn
becomes
where
it
is
really
absent
etc
until
a
scheme
remains
upon
our
hands
the
sublime
paradoxes
of
which
some
of
us
think
that
nothing
short
of
an
can
explain
the
relation
between
idea
and
object
thus
made
abstract
and
saltatory
is
thenceforward
opposed
as
being
more
essential
and
previous
to
its
own
ambulatory
self
and
the
more
concrete
description
is
branded
as
either
false
or
insufficient
the
bridge
of
intermediaries
actual
or
possible
which
in
every
real
case
is
what
carries
and
defines
the
knowing
gets
treated
as
an
episodic
complication
which
need
not
even
potentially
be
there
i
believe
that
this
vulgar
fallacy
of
opposing
abstractions
to
the
concretes
from
which
they
are
abstracted
is
the
main
reason
why
my
account
of
knowing
is
deemed
so
unsatisfactory
and
i
will
therefore
say
a
word
more
on
that
general
point
any
vehicle
of
conjunction
if
all
its
particularities
are
abstracted
from
it
will
leave
us
with
nothing
on
our
hands
but
the
original
disjunction
which
it
bridged
over
but
to
escape
treating
the
resultant
as
an
achievement
of
dialectical
profundity
all
we
need
is
to
restore
some
part
no
matter
how
small
of
what
we
have
taken
away
in
the
case
of
the
epistemological
chasm
the
first
reasonable
step
is
to
remember
that
the
chasm
was
filled
with
some
empirical
material
whether
ideational
or
sensational
which
performed
some
bridging
function
and
saved
us
from
the
mortal
leap
restoring
thus
the
indispensable
modicum
of
reality
to
the
matter
of
our
discussion
we
find
our
abstract
treatment
genuinely
useful
we
escape
entanglement
with
special
cases
without
at
the
same
time
falling
into
gratuitous
paradoxes
we
can
now
describe
the
general
features
of
cognition
tell
what
on
the
whole
it
does
for
us
in
a
universal
way
we
must
remember
that
this
whole
inquiry
into
knowing
grows
up
on
a
reflective
level
in
any
real
moment
of
knowing
what
we
are
thinking
of
is
our
object
not
the
way
in
which
we
ourselves
are
momentarily
knowing
it
we
at
this
moment
as
it
happens
have
knowing
itself
for
our
object
but
i
think
that
the
reader
will
agree
that
his
present
knowing
of
that
object
is
included
only
abstractly
and
by
anticipation
in
the
results
he
may
reach
what
he
concretely
has
before
his
mind
as
he
reasons
is
some
supposed
objective
instance
of
knowing
as
he
conceives
it
to
go
on
in
some
other
person
or
recalls
it
from
his
own
past
as
such
he
the
critic
sees
it
to
contain
both
an
idea
and
an
object
and
processes
by
which
the
knower
is
guided
from
the
one
towards
the
other
he
sees
that
the
idea
is
remote
from
the
object
and
that
whether
through
intermediaries
or
not
it
genuinely
has
to
do
with
it
he
sees
that
it
thus
works
beyond
its
immediate
being
and
lays
hold
of
a
remote
reality
it
jumps
across
transcends
itself
it
does
all
this
by
extraneous
aid
to
be
sure
but
when
the
aid
has
come
it
has
done
it
and
the
result
is
secure
why
not
talk
of
results
by
themselves
then
without
considering
means
why
not
treat
the
idea
as
simply
grasping
or
intuiting
the
reality
of
its
having
the
faculty
anyhow
of
shooting
over
nature
behind
the
scenes
and
knowing
things
immediately
and
directly
why
need
we
always
lug
in
the
bridging
it
only
retards
our
discourse
to
do
so
such
abstract
talk
about
cognition
results
is
surely
convenient
and
it
is
surely
as
legitimate
as
it
is
convenient
so
long
as
we
do
not
forget
or
positively
deny
what
it
ignores
we
may
on
occasion
say
that
our
idea
meant
always
that
particular
object
that
it
led
us
there
because
it
was
of
it
intrinsically
and
essentially
we
may
insist
that
its
verification
follows
upon
that
original
cognitive
virtue
in
it
and
all
the
rest
and
we
shall
do
no
harm
so
long
as
we
know
that
these
are
only
short
cuts
in
our
thinking
they
are
positively
true
accounts
of
fact
as
far
as
they
go
only
they
leave
vast
tracts
of
fact
out
of
the
account
tracts
of
tact
that
have
to
be
reinstated
to
make
the
accounts
literally
true
of
any
real
case
but
if
not
merely
passively
ignoring
the
intermediaries
you
actively
deny
them
footnote
this
is
the
fallacy
which
i
have
called
intellectualism
in
my
book
a
pluralistic
universe
longmans
green
to
be
even
potential
requisites
for
the
results
you
are
so
struck
by
your
epistemology
goes
to
irremediable
smash
you
are
as
far
off
the
track
as
an
historian
would
be
if
lost
in
admiration
of
napoleon
personal
power
he
were
to
ignore
his
marshals
and
his
armies
and
were
to
accuse
you
of
error
in
describing
his
conquests
as
effected
by
their
means
of
such
abstractness
and
i
accuse
most
of
the
critics
of
my
own
account
in
the
second
lecture
of
the
book
pragmatism
i
used
the
illustration
of
a
squirrel
scrambling
round
a
to
keep
out
of
sight
of
a
pursuing
man
both
go
round
the
tree
but
does
the
man
go
round
the
squirrel
it
all
depends
i
said
on
what
you
mean
by
going
round
in
one
sense
of
the
word
the
man
round
in
another
sense
he
does
not
i
settled
the
dispute
by
pragmatically
distinguishing
the
senses
but
i
told
how
some
disputants
had
called
my
distinction
a
shuffling
evasion
and
taken
their
stand
on
what
they
called
honest
english
in
such
a
simple
case
few
people
would
object
to
letting
the
term
in
dispute
be
translated
into
its
concreter
equivalents
but
in
the
case
of
a
complex
function
like
our
knowing
they
act
differently
i
give
full
concrete
particular
value
for
the
ideas
of
knowing
in
every
case
i
can
think
of
yet
my
critics
insist
that
honest
english
knowing
is
left
out
of
my
account
they
write
as
if
the
minus
were
on
my
side
and
the
plus
on
theirs
the
essence
of
the
matter
for
me
is
that
altho
knowing
can
be
both
abstractly
and
concretely
described
and
altho
the
abstract
descriptions
are
often
useful
enough
yet
they
are
all
sucked
up
and
absorbed
without
residuum
into
the
concreter
ones
and
contain
nothing
of
any
essentially
other
or
higher
nature
which
the
concrete
descriptions
can
be
justly
accused
of
leaving
behind
knowing
is
just
a
natural
process
like
any
other
there
is
no
ambulatory
process
whatsoever
the
results
of
which
we
may
not
describe
if
we
prefer
to
in
saltatory
terms
or
represent
in
static
formulation
suppose
that
we
say
a
man
is
concretely
that
means
that
he
takes
out
insurance
hedges
in
betting
looks
before
he
leaps
do
such
acts
constitute
the
prudence
are
they
the
man
qua
prudent
or
is
the
prudence
something
by
itself
and
independent
of
them
as
a
constant
habit
in
him
a
permanent
tone
of
character
it
is
convenient
to
call
him
prudent
in
abstraction
from
any
one
of
his
acts
prudent
in
general
and
without
specification
and
to
say
the
acts
follow
from
the
prudence
there
are
peculiarities
in
his
system
that
make
him
act
prudently
and
there
are
tendencies
to
association
in
our
thoughts
that
prompt
some
of
them
to
make
for
truth
and
others
for
error
but
would
the
man
be
prudent
in
the
absence
of
each
and
all
of
the
acts
or
would
the
thoughts
be
true
if
they
had
no
associative
or
impulsive
tendencies
surely
we
have
no
right
to
oppose
static
essences
in
this
way
to
the
moving
processes
in
which
they
live
embedded
my
bedroom
is
above
my
library
does
the
here
mean
aught
that
is
different
from
the
concrete
spaces
which
have
to
be
in
getting
from
the
one
to
the
other
it
means
you
may
say
a
pure
topographic
relation
a
sort
of
architect
plan
among
the
eternal
essences
but
that
is
not
the
full
aboveness
it
is
only
an
abbreviated
substitute
that
on
occasion
may
lead
my
mind
towards
truer
fuller
dealings
with
the
real
aboveness
it
is
not
an
aboveness
ante
rem
it
is
a
post
rem
extract
from
the
aboveness
in
rebus
we
may
indeed
talk
for
certain
conveniences
as
if
the
abstract
scheme
preceded
we
may
say
must
go
up
stairs
because
of
the
essential
aboveness
just
as
we
may
say
that
the
man
prudent
acts
because
of
his
ingrained
prudence
or
that
our
ideas
us
truly
because
of
their
intrinsic
truth
but
this
should
not
debar
us
on
other
occasions
from
using
completer
forms
of
description
a
concrete
matter
of
fact
always
remains
identical
under
any
form
of
description
as
when
we
say
of
a
line
now
that
it
runs
from
left
to
right
and
now
that
it
runs
from
right
to
left
these
are
but
names
of
one
and
the
same
fact
one
more
expedient
to
use
at
one
time
one
at
another
the
full
facts
of
cognition
whatever
be
the
way
in
which
we
talk
about
them
even
when
we
talk
most
abstractly
stand
inalterably
given
in
the
actualities
and
possibilities
of
the
footnote
the
ultimate
object
or
terminus
of
a
cognitive
process
may
in
certain
instances
lie
beyond
the
direct
experience
of
the
particular
cognizer
but
it
of
course
must
exist
as
part
of
the
total
universe
of
experience
whose
constitution
with
cognition
in
it
the
critic
is
discussing
but
my
critics
treat
my
own
more
concrete
talk
as
if
it
were
the
kind
that
sinned
by
its
inadequacy
and
as
if
the
full
continuum
left
something
out
a
favorite
way
of
opposing
the
more
abstract
to
the
more
concrete
account
is
to
accuse
those
who
favor
the
latter
of
psychology
with
logic
our
critics
say
that
when
we
are
asked
what
truth
means
we
reply
by
telling
only
how
it
is
but
since
a
meaning
is
a
logical
relation
static
independent
of
time
how
can
it
possibly
be
identified
they
say
with
any
concrete
man
experience
perishing
as
this
does
at
the
instant
of
its
production
this
indeed
sounds
profound
but
i
challenge
the
profundity
i
defy
any
one
to
show
any
difference
between
logic
and
psychology
here
the
logical
relation
stands
to
the
psychological
relation
between
idea
and
object
only
as
saltatory
abstractness
stands
to
ambulatory
concreteness
both
relations
need
a
psychological
vehicle
and
the
one
is
simply
the
one
disemboweled
of
its
fulness
and
reduced
to
a
bare
abstractional
scheme
a
while
ago
a
prisoner
on
being
released
tried
to
assassinate
the
judge
who
had
sentenced
him
he
had
apparently
succeeded
in
conceiving
the
judge
timelessly
had
reduced
him
to
a
bare
logical
meaning
that
of
being
his
and
persecutor
by
stripping
off
all
the
concrete
conditions
as
jury
verdict
official
obligation
absence
of
personal
spite
possibly
sympathy
that
gave
its
full
psychological
character
to
the
sentence
as
a
particular
man
act
in
time
truly
the
sentence
was
inimical
to
the
culprit
but
which
idea
of
it
is
the
truer
one
that
bare
logical
definition
of
it
or
its
full
psychological
specification
the
ought
in
consistency
to
stand
up
for
the
view
of
the
case
treat
the
judge
as
the
latter
logical
enemy
and
bar
out
the
other
conditions
as
so
much
inessential
psychological
stuff
ii
a
still
further
obstacle
i
suspect
stands
in
the
way
of
my
acceptance
like
dewey
and
like
schiller
i
have
had
to
say
that
the
truth
of
an
idea
is
determined
by
its
satisfactoriness
but
satisfactoriness
is
a
subjective
term
just
as
idea
is
and
truth
is
generally
regarded
as
readers
who
admit
that
satisfactoriness
is
our
only
mark
of
truth
the
only
sign
that
we
possess
the
precious
article
will
still
say
that
the
objective
relation
between
idea
and
object
which
the
word
points
to
is
left
out
of
my
account
altogether
i
fear
also
that
the
association
of
my
poor
name
with
the
to
believe
which
it
seems
to
me
ought
to
play
no
part
in
this
discussion
works
against
my
credit
in
some
quarters
i
fornicate
with
that
unclean
thing
my
adversaries
may
think
whereas
your
genuine
must
discourse
in
huxleyan
heroics
and
feel
as
if
truth
to
be
real
truth
ought
to
bring
eventual
messages
of
death
to
all
our
satisfactions
such
divergences
certainly
prove
the
complexity
of
the
area
of
our
discussion
but
to
my
mind
they
also
are
based
on
misunderstandings
which
tho
with
but
little
hope
of
success
i
will
try
to
diminish
by
a
further
word
of
explanation
first
then
i
will
ask
my
objectors
to
define
exactly
what
sort
of
thing
it
is
they
have
in
mind
when
they
speak
of
a
truth
that
shall
be
absolute
complete
and
objective
and
then
i
will
defy
them
to
show
me
any
conceivable
for
such
a
kind
of
truth
outside
the
terms
of
my
own
description
it
will
fall
as
i
contend
entirely
within
the
field
of
my
analysis
to
begin
with
it
must
obtain
between
an
idea
and
a
reality
that
is
the
idea
object
and
as
a
predicate
it
must
apply
to
the
idea
and
not
to
the
object
for
objective
realities
are
not
true
at
least
not
in
the
universe
of
discourse
to
which
we
are
now
confining
ourselves
for
there
they
are
taken
as
simply
being
while
the
ideas
are
true
of
them
but
we
can
suppose
a
series
of
ideas
to
be
successively
more
and
more
true
of
the
same
object
and
can
ask
what
is
the
extreme
approach
to
being
absolutely
true
that
the
last
idea
might
attain
to
the
maximal
conceivable
truth
in
an
idea
would
seem
to
be
that
it
should
lead
to
an
actual
merging
of
ourselves
with
the
object
to
an
utter
mutual
confluence
and
identification
on
the
level
of
belief
this
is
what
is
supposed
really
to
take
place
in
my
idea
of
this
pen
verifies
itself
through
my
percept
and
my
percept
is
held
to
be
the
pen
for
the
time
being
percepts
and
physical
realities
being
treated
by
common
sense
as
identical
but
the
physiology
of
the
senses
has
criticised
common
sense
out
of
court
and
the
pen
itself
is
now
believed
to
lie
beyond
my
momentary
percept
yet
the
notion
once
suggested
of
what
a
completely
consummated
acquaintance
with
a
reality
might
be
like
remains
over
for
our
speculative
purposes
total
conflux
of
the
mind
with
the
reality
would
be
the
absolute
limit
of
truth
there
could
be
no
better
or
more
satisfying
knowledge
than
that
such
total
conflux
it
is
needless
to
say
is
already
explicitly
provided
for
as
a
possibility
in
my
account
of
the
matter
if
an
idea
should
ever
lead
us
not
only
towards
or
up
to
or
against
a
reality
but
so
close
that
we
and
the
reality
should
melt
together
it
would
be
made
absolutely
true
according
to
me
by
that
performance
in
point
of
fact
philosophers
doubt
that
this
ever
occurs
what
happens
they
think
is
only
that
we
get
nearer
and
nearer
to
realities
we
approximate
more
and
more
to
the
limit
and
the
definition
of
actually
as
distinguished
from
imaginably
complete
and
objective
truth
can
then
only
be
that
it
belongs
to
the
idea
that
will
lead
us
as
close
up
against
the
object
as
in
the
nature
of
our
experience
is
possible
literally
next
to
it
for
instance
suppose
now
there
were
an
idea
that
did
this
for
a
certain
objective
reality
suppose
that
no
further
approach
were
possible
that
nothing
lay
between
that
the
next
step
would
carry
us
right
into
the
reality
then
that
result
being
the
next
thing
to
conflux
would
make
the
idea
true
in
the
maximal
degree
that
might
be
supposed
practically
attainable
in
the
world
which
we
inhabit
well
i
need
hardly
explain
that
that
degree
of
truth
is
also
provided
for
in
my
account
of
the
matter
and
if
satisfactions
are
the
marks
of
truth
presence
we
may
add
that
any
less
true
substitute
for
such
a
true
idea
would
prove
less
satisfactory
following
its
lead
we
should
probably
find
out
that
we
did
not
quite
touch
the
terminus
we
should
desiderate
a
closer
approach
and
not
rest
till
we
had
found
it
i
am
of
course
postulating
here
a
standing
reality
independent
of
the
idea
that
knows
it
i
am
also
postulating
that
satisfactions
grow
pari
passu
with
our
approximation
to
such
reality
footnote
say
if
you
prefer
to
that
dissatisfactions
decrease
pari
passu
with
such
approximation
the
approximation
may
be
of
any
kind
assignable
approximation
in
time
or
in
space
or
approximation
in
kind
which
in
common
speech
means
if
my
critics
challenge
this
latter
assumption
i
retort
upon
them
with
the
former
our
whole
notion
of
a
standing
reality
grows
up
in
the
form
of
an
ideal
limit
to
the
series
of
successive
termini
to
which
our
thoughts
have
led
us
and
still
are
leading
us
each
terminus
proves
provisional
by
leaving
us
unsatisfied
the
truer
idea
is
the
one
that
pushes
farther
so
we
are
ever
beckoned
on
by
the
ideal
notion
of
an
ultimate
completely
satisfactory
terminus
i
for
one
obey
and
accept
that
notion
i
can
conceive
no
other
objective
content
to
the
notion
of
ideally
perfect
truth
than
that
of
penetration
into
such
a
terminus
nor
can
i
conceive
that
the
notion
would
ever
have
grown
up
or
that
true
ideas
would
ever
have
been
sorted
out
from
false
or
idle
ones
save
for
the
greater
sum
of
satisfactions
intellectual
or
practical
which
the
truer
ones
brought
with
them
can
we
imagine
a
man
absolutely
satisfied
with
an
idea
and
with
all
its
relations
to
his
other
ideas
and
to
his
sensible
experiences
who
should
yet
not
take
its
content
as
a
true
account
of
reality
the
matter
of
the
true
is
thus
absolutely
identical
with
the
matter
of
the
satisfactory
you
may
put
either
word
first
in
your
ways
of
talking
but
leave
out
that
whole
notion
of
satisfactory
working
or
leading
which
is
the
essence
of
my
pragmatistic
account
and
call
truth
a
static
logical
relation
independent
even
of
possible
leadings
or
satisfactions
and
it
seems
to
me
you
cut
all
ground
from
under
you
i
fear
that
i
am
still
very
obscure
but
i
respectfully
implore
those
who
reject
my
doctrine
because
they
can
make
nothing
of
my
stumbling
language
to
tell
us
in
their
own
name
und
zwar
very
concretely
and
articulately
just
how
the
real
genuine
and
absolutely
truth
which
they
believe
in
so
profoundly
is
constituted
and
established
they
must
point
to
the
itself
for
truth
is
only
our
subjective
relation
to
realities
what
is
the
nominal
essence
of
this
relation
its
logical
definition
whether
or
not
it
be
attainable
by
mortals
whatever
they
may
say
it
is
i
have
the
firmest
faith
that
my
account
will
prove
to
have
allowed
for
it
and
included
it
by
anticipation
as
one
possible
case
in
the
total
mixture
of
cases
there
is
in
short
no
room
for
any
grade
or
sort
of
truth
outside
of
the
framework
of
the
pragmatic
system
outside
of
that
jungle
of
empirical
workings
and
leadings
and
their
nearer
or
ulterior
terminations
of
which
i
seem
to
have
written
so

j
pratt
paper
in
the
journal
of
philosophy
for
june
is
so
brilliantly
written
that
its
misconception
of
the
pragmatist
position
seems
doubly
to
call
for
a
reply
he
asserts
that
for
a
pragmatist
truth
can
not
be
a
relation
between
an
idea
and
a
reality
outside
and
transcendent
of
the
idea
but
must
lie
within
experience
where
it
will
need
reference
to
anything
else
to
justify
it
no
reference
to
the
object
apparently
the
pragmatist
must
everything
to
psychology
aye
and
to
the
psychology
of
the
immediate
moment
he
is
consequently
debarred
from
saying
that
an
idea
that
eventually
gets
psychologically
verified
was
already
true
before
the
process
of
verifying
was
complete
and
he
is
equally
debarred
from
treating
an
idea
as
true
provisionally
so
long
as
he
only
believes
that
he
can
verify
it
whenever
he
will
whether
such
a
pragmatist
as
this
exists
i
know
not
never
having
myself
met
with
the
beast
we
can
define
terms
as
we
like
and
if
that
be
my
friend
pratt
definition
of
a
pragmatist
i
can
only
concur
with
his
but
in
setting
up
the
weird
type
he
quotes
words
from
me
so
in
order
to
escape
being
classed
by
some
reader
along
with
so
asinine
a
being
i
will
reassert
my
own
view
of
truth
once
more
truth
is
essentially
a
relation
between
two
things
an
idea
on
the
one
hand
and
a
reality
outside
of
the
idea
on
the
other
this
relation
like
all
relations
has
its
fundamentum
namely
the
matrix
of
experiential
circumstance
psychological
as
well
as
physical
in
which
the
correlated
terms
are
found
embedded
in
the
case
of
the
relation
between
and
the
fundamentum
is
a
world
in
which
there
was
a
testator
and
in
which
there
is
now
a
will
and
an
executor
in
the
case
of
that
between
idea
and
object
it
is
a
world
with
circumstances
of
a
sort
to
make
a
satisfactory
verification
process
lying
around
and
between
the
two
terms
but
just
as
a
man
may
be
called
an
heir
and
treated
as
one
before
the
executor
has
divided
the
estate
so
an
idea
may
practically
be
credited
with
truth
before
the
verification
process
has
been
exhaustively
carried
out
the
existence
of
the
mass
of
verifying
circumstance
is
enough
where
potentiality
counts
for
actuality
in
so
many
other
cases
one
does
not
see
why
it
may
not
so
count
here
we
call
a
man
benevolent
not
only
for
his
kind
acts
paid
in
but
for
his
readiness
to
perform
others
we
treat
an
idea
as
not
only
for
the
light
it
has
shed
but
for
that
we
expect
it
will
shed
on
dark
problems
why
should
we
not
equally
trust
the
truth
of
our
ideas
we
live
on
credits
everywhere
and
we
use
our
ideas
far
oftener
for
calling
up
things
connected
with
their
immediate
objects
than
for
calling
up
those
objects
themselves
times
out
of
a
hundred
the
only
use
we
should
make
of
the
object
itself
if
we
were
led
up
to
it
by
our
idea
would
be
to
pass
on
to
those
connected
things
by
its
means
so
we
continually
curtail
letting
our
belief
that
they
are
possible
suffice
what
constitutes
the
relation
known
as
truth
i
now
say
is
just
the
existence
in
the
empirical
world
of
this
fundamentum
of
circumstance
surrounding
object
and
idea
and
ready
to
be
either
or
traversed
at
full
length
so
long
as
it
exists
and
a
satisfactory
passage
through
it
between
the
object
and
the
idea
is
possible
that
idea
will
both
be
true
and
will
have
been
true
of
that
object
whether
fully
developed
verification
has
taken
place
or
not
the
nature
and
place
and
affinities
of
the
object
of
course
play
as
vital
a
part
in
making
the
particular
passage
possible
as
do
the
nature
and
associative
tendencies
of
the
idea
so
that
the
notion
that
truth
could
fall
altogether
inside
of
the
thinker
private
experience
and
be
something
purely
psychological
is
absurd
it
is
between
the
idea
and
the
object
that
the
is
to
be
sought
and
it
involves
both
terms
but
the
position
if
i
understand
pratt
rightly
is
that
altho
we
can
use
this
fundamentum
this
mass
of
experience
for
testing
truth
yet
the
in
itself
remains
as
something
apart
it
means
in
pratt
words
merely
simple
thing
that
the
object
of
which
one
is
thinking
is
as
one
thinks
it
it
seems
to
me
that
the
word
which
qualifies
the
relation
here
and
bears
the
whole
burden
is
anything
but
simple
what
it
most
immediately
suggests
is
that
the
idea
should
be
like
the
object
but
most
of
our
ideas
being
abstract
concepts
bear
almost
no
resemblance
to
their
objects
the
must
therefore
i
should
say
be
usually
interpreted
functionally
as
meaning
that
the
idea
shall
lead
us
into
the
same
quarters
of
experience
as
the
object
would
experience
leads
ever
on
and
on
and
objects
and
our
ideas
of
objects
may
both
lead
to
the
same
goals
the
ideas
being
in
that
case
shorter
cuts
we
substitute
them
more
and
more
for
their
objects
and
we
habitually
waive
direct
verification
of
each
one
of
them
as
their
train
passes
through
our
mind
because
if
an
idea
leads
as
the
object
would
lead
we
can
say
in
pratt
words
that
in
so
far
forth
the
object
is
as
we
think
it
and
that
the
idea
verified
thus
in
so
far
forth
is
true
enough
pratt
will
undoubtedly
accept
most
of
these
facts
but
he
will
deny
that
they
spell
pragmatism
of
course
definitions
are
free
to
every
one
but
i
have
myself
never
meant
by
the
pragmatic
view
of
truth
anything
different
from
what
i
now
describe
and
inasmuch
as
my
use
of
the
term
came
earlier
than
my
friend
i
think
it
ought
to
have
the
right
of
way
but
i
suspect
that
professor
pratt
contention
is
not
solely
as
to
what
one
must
think
in
order
to
be
called
a
pragmatist
i
am
cure
that
he
believes
that
the
has
something
more
in
it
than
the
fundamentum
which
i
assign
can
account
for
useful
to
test
truth
by
the
matrix
of
circumstance
he
thinks
can
not
found
the
in
se
for
that
is
and
well
take
an
object
and
an
idea
and
assume
that
the
latter
is
true
of
the
former
as
eternally
and
absolutely
true
as
you
like
let
the
object
be
as
much
the
idea
thinks
it
as
it
is
possible
for
one
thing
to
be
another
i
now
formally
ask
of
professor
pratt
to
tell
what
this
in
itself
consists
in
for
it
seems
to
me
that
it
ought
to
consist
in
something
assignable
and
describable
and
not
remain
a
pure
mystery
and
i
promise
that
if
he
can
assign
any
determination
of
it
whatever
which
i
can
not
successfully
refer
to
some
specification
of
what
in
this
article
i
have
called
the
empirical
fundamentum
i
will
confess
my
stupidity
cheerfully
and
will
agree
never
to
publish
a
line
upon
this
subject
of
truth
again

pratt
what
is
pragmatism
new
york
the
macmillan
company
the
comments
i
have
printed
were
written
in
march
after
some
of
the
articles
printed
later
in
the
present
volume
which
for
its
clearness
and
good
temper
deserves
to
supersede
all
the
rest
of
the
literature
i
wish
it
might
do
so
for
its
author
admits
all
my
essential
contentions
simply
distinguishing
my
account
of
truth
as
pragmatism
from
schiller
and
dewey
which
he
calls
pragmatism
of
the
sort
as
i
myself
understand
dewey
and
schiller
our
views
absolutely
agree
in
spite
of
our
different
modes
of
statement
but
i
have
enough
trouble
of
my
own
in
life
without
having
to
defend
my
friends
so
i
abandon
them
provisionally
to
the
tender
mercy
of
professor
pratt
interpretations
utterly
erroneous
tho
i
deem
these
to
be
my
reply
as
regards
myself
can
be
very
short
for
i
prefer
to
consider
only
essentials
and
pratt
whole
book
hardly
takes
the
matter
farther
than
the
article
to
which
i
retort
in
part
i
of
the
present
paper
he
repeats
the
as
if
it
were
something
that
i
along
with
other
pragmatists
had
denied
footnote
op
pp
whereas
i
have
only
asked
those
who
insist
so
on
its
importance
to
do
something
more
than
merely
utter
it
to
explicate
it
for
example
and
tell
us
what
its
so
great
importance
consists
in
i
myself
agree
most
cordially
that
for
an
idea
to
be
true
the
object
must
be
the
idea
declares
it
but
i
explicate
the
as
meaning
the
idea
verifiability
now
since
pratt
denies
none
of
these
verifying
for
which
i
have
pleaded
but
only
insists
on
their
inability
to
serve
as
the
fundamentum
of
the
it
seems
that
there
is
really
nothing
in
the
line
of
fact
about
which
we
differ
and
that
the
issue
between
us
is
solely
as
to
how
far
the
notion
of
workableness
or
verifiability
is
an
essential
part
of
the
notion
of
being
pratt
present
name
for
the
character
of
in
the
true
idea
i
maintain
that
there
is
no
meaning
left
in
this
notion
of
or
trueness
if
no
reference
to
the
possibility
of
concrete
working
on
the
part
of
the
idea
is
made
take
an
example
where
there
can
be
no
possible
working
suppose
i
have
an
idea
to
which
i
give
utterance
by
the
vocable
claiming
at
the
same
time
that
it
is
true
who
now
can
say
that
it
is
false
for
why
may
there
not
be
somewhere
in
the
unplumbed
depths
of
the
cosmos
some
object
with
which
can
agree
and
have
trueness
in
sense
on
the
other
hand
who
can
say
that
it
is
true
for
who
can
lay
his
hand
on
that
object
and
show
that
it
and
nothing
else
is
what
i
mean
by
my
word
but
yet
again
who
can
gainsay
any
one
who
shall
call
my
word
utterly
irrelative
to
other
reality
and
treat
it
as
a
bare
fact
in
my
mind
devoid
of
any
cognitive
function
whatever
one
of
these
three
alternatives
must
surely
be
predicated
of
it
for
it
not
to
be
irrelevant
or
in
nature
an
object
of
some
kind
must
be
provided
which
it
may
refer
to
supposing
that
object
provided
whether
is
true
or
false
of
it
depends
according
to
professor
pratt
on
no
intermediating
condition
whatever
the
trueness
or
the
falsity
is
even
now
immediately
absolutely
and
positively
there
i
on
the
other
hand
demand
a
cosmic
environment
of
some
kind
to
establish
which
of
them
is
there
rather
than
utter
irrelevancy
footnote
pratt
singularly
enough
disposes
of
this
primal
postulate
of
all
pragmatic
epistemology
by
saying
that
the
pragmatist
surrenders
his
whole
case
by
smuggling
in
the
idea
of
a
conditioning
environment
which
determines
whether
or
not
the
experience
can
work
and
which
can
not
itself
be
identified
with
the
experience
or
any
part
of
it
pp
the
means
here
of
course
the
idea
or
belief
and
the
expression
in
is
to
the
last
degree
diverting
if
any
epistemologist
could
dispense
with
a
conditioning
environment
it
would
seem
to
be
the
antipragmatist
with
his
immediate
saltatory
trueness
independent
of
work
done
the
mediating
pathway
which
the
environment
supplies
is
the
very
essence
of
the
explanation
i
then
say
first
that
unless
some
sort
of
a
natural
path
exists
between
the
and
that
object
distinguishable
among
the
innumerable
pathways
that
run
among
all
the
realities
of
the
universe
linking
them
promiscuously
with
one
another
there
is
nothing
there
to
constitute
even
the
possibility
of
its
referring
to
that
object
rather
than
to
any
other
i
say
furthermore
that
unless
it
have
some
tendency
to
follow
up
that
path
there
is
nothing
to
constitute
its
intention
to
refer
to
the
object
in
question
finally
i
say
that
unless
the
path
be
strown
with
possibilities
of
frustration
or
encouragement
and
offer
some
sort
of
terminal
satisfaction
or
contradiction
there
is
nothing
to
constitute
its
agreement
or
disagreement
with
that
object
or
to
constitute
the
or
in
which
the
trueness
or
falseness
is
said
to
consist
i
think
that
pratt
ought
to
do
something
more
than
repeat
the
name
in
answer
to
my
pathetic
question
whether
that
there
be
not
some
constitution
to
a
relation
as
important
as
this
the
pathway
the
tendency
the
corroborating
or
contradicting
progress
need
not
in
every
case
be
experienced
in
full
but
i
do
see
if
the
universe
contain
them
among
its
possibilities
of
furniture
what
logical
material
for
defining
the
trueness
of
my
idea
is
left
but
if
it
do
contain
them
they
and
they
only
are
the
logical
material
required
i
am
perplexed
by
the
superior
importance
which
pratt
attributes
to
abstract
trueness
over
concrete
verifiability
in
an
idea
and
i
wish
that
he
might
be
moved
to
explain
it
is
prior
to
verification
to
be
sure
but
so
is
the
verifiability
for
which
i
contend
prior
just
as
a
man
which
is
nothing
but
the
possibility
of
his
death
is
prior
to
his
death
but
it
can
hardly
be
that
this
abstract
priority
of
all
possibility
to
its
correlative
fact
is
what
so
obstinate
a
quarrel
is
about
i
think
it
probable
that
pratt
is
vaguely
thinking
of
something
concreter
than
this
the
trueness
of
an
idea
must
mean
something
definite
in
it
that
determines
its
tendency
to
work
and
indeed
towards
this
object
rather
than
towards
that
undoubtedly
there
is
something
of
this
sort
in
the
idea
just
as
there
is
something
in
man
that
accounts
for
his
tendency
towards
death
and
in
bread
that
accounts
for
its
tendency
to
nourish
what
that
something
is
in
the
case
of
truth
psychology
tells
us
the
idea
has
associates
peculiar
to
itself
motor
as
well
as
ideational
it
tends
by
its
place
and
nature
to
call
these
into
being
one
after
another
and
the
appearance
of
them
in
succession
is
what
we
mean
by
the
of
the
idea
according
to
what
they
are
does
the
trueness
or
falseness
which
the
idea
harbored
come
to
light
these
tendencies
have
still
earlier
conditions
which
in
a
general
way
biology
psychology
and
biography
can
trace
this
whole
chain
of
natural
causal
conditions
produces
a
resultant
state
of
things
in
which
new
relations
not
simply
causal
can
now
be
found
or
into
which
they
can
now
be
introduced
the
relations
namely
which
we
epistemologists
study
relations
of
adaptation
of
substitutability
of
instrumentality
of
reference
and
of
truth
the
prior
causal
conditions
altho
there
could
be
no
knowing
of
any
kind
true
or
false
without
them
are
but
preliminary
to
the
question
of
what
makes
the
ideas
true
or
false
when
once
their
tendencies
have
been
obeyed
the
tendencies
must
exist
in
some
shape
anyhow
but
their
fruits
are
truth
falsity
or
irrelevancy
according
to
what
they
concretely
turn
out
to
be
they
are
not
at
any
rate
for
they
evoke
their
consequences
contiguously
from
next
to
next
only
and
not
until
the
final
result
of
the
whole
associative
sequence
actual
or
potential
is
in
our
mental
sight
can
we
feel
sure
what
its
epistemological
significance
if
it
have
any
may
be
true
knowing
is
in
fine
not
substantially
in
itself
or
such
inside
of
the
idea
from
the
first
any
more
than
mortality
as
such
is
inside
of
the
man
or
nourishment
as
such
inside
of
the
bread
something
else
is
there
first
that
practically
makes
for
knowing
dying
or
nourishing
as
the
case
may
be
that
something
is
the
namely
of
the
first
term
be
it
idea
man
or
bread
that
operates
to
start
the
causal
chain
of
processes
which
when
completed
is
the
complex
fact
to
which
we
give
whatever
functional
name
best
fits
the
case
another
nature
another
chain
of
cognitive
workings
and
then
either
another
object
known
or
the
same
object
known
differently
will
ensue
pratt
perplexes
me
again
by

i
am
not
sure
that
he
charges
me
with
an
account
of
truth
which
would
allow
the
object
believed
in
not
to
exist
even
if
the
belief
in
it
were
true
the
truth
of
an
idea
he
writes
merely
the
fact
that
the
idea
works
that
fact
is
all
that
you
mean
when
you
say
the
idea
is
true
you
say
the
idea
is
true
does
that
mean
true
for
you
the
critic
or
true
for
the
believer
whom
you
are
describing
the
critic
trouble
over
this
seems
to
come
from
his
taking
the
word
irrelatively
whereas
the
pragmatist
always
means
for
him
who
experiences
the
workings
is
the
object
really
true
or
not
the
critic
then
seems
to
ask
as
if
the
pragmatist
were
bound
to
throw
in
a
whole
ontology
on
top
of
his
epistemology
and
tell
us
what
realities
indubitably
exist
world
at
a
time
would
seem
to
be
the
right
reply
here
one
other
trouble
of
pratt
must
be
noticed
it
concerns
the
of
the
object
when
our
ideas
have
worked
so
as
to
bring
us
flat
up
against
the
object
next
to
it
our
relation
to
it
then
ambulatory
or
saltatory
pratt
asks
if
your
headache
be
my
object
experiences
break
off
where
yours
begin
pratt
writes
and
fact
is
of
great
importance
for
it
bars
out
the
sense
of
transition
and
fulfilment
which
forms
so
important
an
element
in
the
pragmatist
description
of
knowledge
the
sense
of
fulfilment
due
to
a
continuous
passage
from
the
original
idea
to
the
known
object
if
this
comes
at
all
when
i
know
your
headache
it
comes
not
with
the
object
but
quite
on
my
side
of
the
epistemological
gulf
the
gulf
is
still
there
to
be
transcended
some
day
of
course
or
even
now
somewhere
in
the
larger
life
of
the
universe
different
men
headaches
may
become
confluent
or
be
here
and
now
however
headaches
do
transcend
each
other
and
when
not
felt
can
be
known
only
conceptually
my
idea
is
that
you
really
have
a
headache
it
works
well
with
what
i
see
of
your
expression
and
with
what
i
hear
you
say
but
it
does
put
me
in
possession
of
the
headache
itself
i
am
still
at
one
remove
and
the
headache
me
even
tho
it
be
in
nowise
transcendent
of
human
experience
generally
bit
the
here
is
that
which
the
pragmatist
epistemology
itself
fixes
in
the
very
first
words
it
uses
by
saying
there
must
be
an
object
and
an
idea
the
idea
however
immediately
leap
the
gulf
it
only
works
from
next
to
next
so
as
to
bridge
it
fully
or
approximately
if
it
bridges
it
in
the
vision
of
his
hypothetical
universe
it
can
be
called
a
idea
if
it
only
might
bridge
it
but
does
or
if
it
throws
a
bridge
distinctly
at
it
it
still
has
in
the
onlooking
pragmatist
eyes
what
professor
pratt
calls
but
to
ask
the
pragmatist
thereupon
whether
when
it
thus
fails
to
coalesce
bodily
with
the
object
it
is
really
true
or
has
real
trueness
in
other
words
whether
the
headache
he
supposes
and
supposes
the
thinker
he
supposes
to
believe
in
be
a
real
headache
or
not
is
to
step
from
his
hypothetical
universe
of
discourse
into
the
altogether
different
world
of
natural
fact

the
pragmatist
account
of

and
its
misunderstanders
footnote
reprint

review
january
vol
xvii
p
the
account
of
truth
given
in
my
volume
entitled
pragmatism
continues
to
meet
with
such
persistent
misunderstanding
that
i
am
tempted
to
make
a
final
brief
reply
my
ideas
may
well
deserve
refutation
but
they
can
get
none
till
they
are
conceived
of
in
their
proper
shape
the
fantastic
character
of
the
current
misconceptions
shows
how
unfamiliar
is
the
concrete
point
of
view
which
pragmatism
assumes
persons
who
are
familiar
with
a
conception
move
about
so
easily
in
it
that
they
understand
each
other
at
a
hint
and
can
converse
without
anxiously
attending
to
their
p
and
q
i
have
to
admit
in
view
of
the
results
that
we
have
assumed
too
ready
an
intelligence
and
consequently
in
many
places
used
a
language
too
slipshod
we
should
never
have
spoken
elliptically
the
critics
have
boggled
at
every
word
they
could
boggle
at
and
refused
to
take
the
spirit
rather
than
the
letter
of
our
discourse
this
seems
to
show
a
genuine
unfamiliarity
in
the
whole
point
of
view
it
also
shows
i
think
that
the
second
stage
of
opposition
which
has
already
begun
to
express
itself
in
the
stock
phrase
that
is
new
is
not
true
and
what
is
true
not
new
in
pragmatism
is
insincere
if
we
said
nothing
in
any
degree
new
why
was
our
meaning
so
desperately
hard
to
catch
the
blame
can
not
be
laid
wholly
upon
our
obscurity
of
speech
for
in
other
subjects
we
have
attained
to
making
ourselves
understood
but
recriminations
are
tasteless
and
as
far
as
i
personally
am
concerned
i
am
sure
that
some
of
the
misconception
i
complain
of
is
due
to
my
doctrine
of
truth
being
surrounded
in
that
volume
of
popular
lectures
by
a
lot
of
other
opinions
not
necessarily
implicated
with
it
so
that
a
reader
may
very
naturally
have
grown
confused
for
this
i
am
to
blame
likewise
for
omitting
certain
explicit
cautions
which
the
pages
that
follow
will
now
in
part
supply
first
misunderstanding
pragmatism
is
only
a
of
positivism
this
seems
the
commonest
mistake
scepticism
positivism
and
agnosticism
agree
with
ordinary
dogmatic
rationalism
in
presupposing
that
everybody
knows
what
the
word
means
without
further
explanation
but
the
former
doctrines
then
either
suggest
or
declare
that
real
truth
absolute
truth
is
inaccessible
to
us
and
that
we
must
fain
put
up
with
relative
or
phenomenal
truth
as
its
next
best
substitute
by
scepticism
this
is
treated
as
an
unsatisfactory
state
of
affairs
while
positivism
and
agnosticism
are
cheerful
about
it
call
real
truth
sour
grapes
and
consider
phenomenal
truth
quite
sufficient
for
all
our
purposes
in
point
of
fact
nothing
could
be
farther
from
all
this
than
what
pragmatism
has
to
say
of
truth
its
thesis
is
an
altogether
previous
one
it
leaves
off
where
these
other
theories
begin
having
contented
itself
with
the
word
truth
definition
matter
whether
any
mind
extant
in
the
universe
possess
truth
or
not
it
asks
does
the
notion
of
truth
signify
ideally
kind
of
things
would
true
judgments
be
in
case
they
existed
the
answer
which
pragmatism
offers
is
intended
to
cover
the
most
complete
truth
that
can
be
conceived
of
truth
if
you
like
as
well
as
truth
of
the
most
relative
and
imperfect
description
this
question
of
what
truth
would
be
like
if
it
did
exist
belongs
obviously
to
a
purely
speculative
field
of
inquiry
it
is
not
a
theory
about
any
sort
of
reality
or
about
what
kind
of
knowledge
is
actually
possible
it
abstracts
from
particular
terms
altogether
and
defines
the
nature
of
a
possible
relation
between
two
of
them
as
kant
question
about
synthetic
judgments
had
escaped
previous
philosophers
so
the
pragmatist
question
is
not
only
so
subtile
as
to
have
escaped
attention
hitherto
but
even
so
subtile
it
would
seem
that
when
openly
broached
now
dogmatists
and
sceptics
alike
fail
to
apprehend
it
and
deem
the
pragmatist
to
be
treating
of
something
wholly
different
he
insists
they
say
i
quote
an
actual
critic
the
greater
problems
are
insoluble
by
human
intelligence
that
our
need
of
knowing
truly
is
artificial
and
illusory
and
that
our
reason
incapable
of
reaching
the
foundations
of
reality
must
turn
itself
exclusively
towards
action
there
could
not
be
a
worse
misapprehension
second
misunderstanding
pragmatism
is
primarily
an
appeal
to
action
the
name
with
its
suggestions
of
action
has
been
an
unfortunate
choice
i
have
to
admit
and
has
played
into
the
hands
of
this
mistake
but
no
word
could
protect
the
doctrine
from
critics
so
blind
to
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
that
when
schiller
speaks
of
ideas
well
the
only
thing
they
think
of
is
their
immediate
workings
in
the
physical
environment
their
enabling
us
to
make
money
or
gain
some
similar
advantage
ideas
do
work
thus
of
course
immediately
or
remotely
but
they
work
indefinitely
inside
of
the
mental
world
also
not
crediting
us
with
this
rudimentary
insight
our
critics
treat
our
view
as
offering
itself
exclusively
to
engineers
doctors
financiers
and
men
of
action
generally
who
need
some
sort
of
a
rough
and
ready
weltanschauung
but
have
no
time
or
wit
to
study
genuine
philosophy
it
is
usually
described
as
a
characteristically
american
movement
a
sort
of
bobtailed
scheme
of
thought
excellently
fitted
for
the
man
on
the
street
who
naturally
hates
theory
and
wants
cash
returns
immediately
it
is
quite
true
that
when
the
refined
theoretic
question
that
pragmatism
begins
with
is
once
answered
secondary
corollaries
of
a
practical
sort
follow
investigation
shows
that
in
the
function
called
truth
previous
realities
are
not
the
only
independent
variables
to
a
certain
extent
our
ideas
being
realities
are
also
independent
variables
and
just
as
they
follow
other
reality
and
fit
it
so
in
a
measure
does
other
reality
follow
and
fit
them
when
they
add
themselves
to
being
they
partly
redetermine
the
existent
so
that
reality
as
a
whole
appears
incompletely
definable
unless
ideas
also
are
kept
account
of
this
pragmatist
doctrine
exhibiting
our
ideas
as
complemental
factors
of
reality
throws
open
since
our
ideas
are
instigators
of
our
action
a
wide
window
upon
human
action
as
well
as
a
wide
license
to
originality
in
thought
but
few
things
could
be
sillier
than
to
ignore
the
prior
epistemological
edifice
in
which
the
window
is
built
or
to
talk
as
if
pragmatism
began
and
ended
at
the
window
this
nevertheless
is
what
our
critics
do
almost
without
exception
they
ignore
our
primary
step
and
its
motive
and
make
the
relation
to
action
which
is
our
secondary
achievement
primary
third
misunderstanding
pragmatists
cut
themselves
off
from
the
right
to
believe
in
ejective
realities
they
do
so
according
to
the
critics
by
making
the
truth
of
our
beliefs
consist
in
their
verifiability
and
their
verifiability
in
the
way
in
which
they
do
work
for
us
professor
stout
in
his
otherwise
admirable
and
hopeful
review
of
schiller
in
mind
for
october
considers
that
this
ought
to
lead
schiller
could
he
sincerely
realize
the
effects
of
his
own
doctrine
to
the
absurd
consequence
of
being
unable
to
believe
genuinely
in
another
man
headache
even
were
the
headache
there
he
can
only
it
for
the
sake
of
the
working
value
of
the
postulate
to
himself
the
postulate
guides
certain
of
his
acts
and
leads
to
advantageous
consequences
but
the
moment
he
understands
fully
that
the
postulate
is
true
only
in
this
sense
it
ceases
or
should
cease
to
be
true
for
him
that
the
other
man
really
has
a
headache
all
that
makes
the
postulate
most
precious
then
evaporates
his
interest
in
his
a
veiled
form
of
and
his
world
grows
cold
dull
and
heartless
such
an
objection
makes
a
curious
muddle
of
the
pragmatist
universe
of
discourse
within
that
universe
the
pragmatist
finds
some
one
with
a
headache
or
other
feeling
and
some
one
else
who
postulates
that
feeling
asking
on
what
condition
the
postulate
is
the
pragmatist
replies
that
for
the
postulator
at
any
rate
it
is
true
just
in
proportion
as
to
believe
in
it
works
in
him
the
fuller
sum
of
satisfactions
what
is
it
that
is
satisfactory
here
surely
to
believe
in
the
postulated
object
namely
in
the
really
existing
feeling
of
the
other
man
but
how
especially
if
the
postulator
were
himself
a
thoroughgoing
pragmatist
could
it
ever
be
satisfactory
to
him
not
to
believe
in
that
feeling
so
long
as
in
professor
stout
words
disbelief
the
world
seem
to
him
cold
dull
and
heartless
disbelief
would
seem
on
pragmatist
principles
quite
out
of
the
question
under
such
conditions
unless
the
heartlessness
of
the
world
were
made
probable
already
on
other
grounds
and
since
the
belief
in
the
headache
true
for
the
subject
assumed
in
the
pragmatist
universe
of
discourse
is
also
true
for
the
pragmatist
who
for
his
epitemologizing
purposes
has
assumed
that
entire
universe
why
is
it
not
true
in
that
universe
absolutely
the
headache
believed
in
is
a
reality
there
and
no
extant
mind
disbelieves
it
neither
the
critic
mind
nor
his
subject
have
our
opponents
any
better
brand
of
truth
in
this
real
universe
of
ours
that
they
can
show
us
footnote
i
see
here
a
chance
to
forestall
a
criticism
which
some
one
may
make
on
lecture
iii
of
my
pragmatism
where
on
pp
i
said
that
and
might
be
regarded
as
synonymous
terms
so
long
as
no
differing
future
consequences
were
deducible
from
the
two
conceptions
the
passage
was
transcribed
from
my
address
at
the
california
philosophical
union
reprinted
in
the
journal
of
philosophy
vol
i
i
had
no
sooner
given
the
address
than
i
perceived
a
flaw
in
that
part
of
it
but
i
have
left
the
passage
unaltered
ever
since
because
the
flaw
did
not
spoil
its
illustrative
value
the
flaw
was
evident
when
as
a
case
analogous
to
that
of
a
godless
universe
i
thought
of
what
i
called
an
sweetheart
meaning
a
soulless
body
which
should
be
absolutely
indistinguishable
from
a
spiritually
animated
maiden
laughing
talking
blushing
nursing
us
and
performing
all
feminine
offices
as
tactfully
and
sweetly
as
if
a
soul
were
in
her
would
any
one
regard
her
as
a
full
equivalent
certainly
not
and
why
because
framed
as
we
are
our
egoism
craves
above
all
things
inward
sympathy
and
recognition
love
and
admiration
the
outward
treatment
is
valued
mainly
as
an
expression
as
a
manifestation
of
the
accompanying
consciousness
believed
in
pragmatically
then
belief
in
the
automatic
sweetheart
would
not
work
and
is
point
of
fact
no
one
treats
it
as
a
serious
hypothesis
the
godless
universe
would
be
exactly
similar
even
if
matter
could
do
every
outward
thing
that
god
does
the
idea
of
it
would
not
work
as
satisfactorily
because
the
chief
call
for
a
god
on
modern
men
part
is
for
a
being
who
will
inwardly
recognize
them
and
judge
them
sympathetically
matter
disappoints
this
craving
of
our
ego
so
god
remains
for
most
men
the
truer
hypothesis
and
indeed
remains
so
for
definite
pragmatic
reasons
so
much
for
the
third
misunderstanding
which
is
but
one
specification
of
the
following
still
wider
one
fourth
misunderstanding
no
pragmatist
can
be
a
realist
in
his
epistemology
this
is
supposed
to
follow
from
his
statement
that
the
truth
of
our
beliefs
consists
in
general
in
their
giving
satisfaction
of
course
satisfaction
per
se
is
a
subjective
condition
so
the
conclusion
is
drawn
that
truth
falls
wholly
inside
of
the
subject
who
then
may
manufacture
it
at
his
pleasure
true
beliefs
become
thus
wayward
affections
severed
from
all
responsibility
to
other
parts
of
experience
it
is
difficult
to
excuse
such
a
parody
of
the
pragmatist
opinion
ignoring
as
it
does
every
element
but
one
of
his
universe
of
discourse
the
terms
of
which
that
universe
consists
positively
forbid
any
interpretation
of
the
function
of
knowledge
defined
there
the
pragmatizing
epistemologist
posits
there
a
reality
and
a
mind
with
ideas
what
now
he
asks
can
make
those
ideas
true
of
that
reality
ordinary
epistemology
contents
itself
with
the
vague
statement
that
the
ideas
must
or
the
pragmatist
insists
on
being
more
concrete
and
asks
what
such
may
mean
in
detail
he
finds
first
that
the
ideas
must
point
to
or
lead
towards
that
reality
and
no
other
and
then
that
the
pointings
and
leadings
must
yield
satisfaction
as
their
result
so
far
the
pragmatist
is
hardly
less
abstract
than
the
ordinary
slouchy
epistemologist
but
as
he
defines
himself
farther
he
grows
more
concrete
the
entire
quarrel
of
the
intellectualist
with
him
is
over
his
concreteness
intellectualism
contending
that
the
vaguer
and
more
abstract
account
is
here
the
more
profound
the
concrete
pointing
and
leading
are
conceived
by
the
pragmatist
to
be
the
work
of
other
portions
of
the
same
universe
to
which
the
reality
and
the
mind
belong
intermediary
verifying
bits
of
experience
with
which
the
mind
at
one
end
and
the
reality
at
the
other
are
joined
the
in
turn
is
no
abstract
satisfaction
ueberhaupt
felt
by
an
unspecified
being
but
is
assumed
to
consist
of
such
satisfactions
in
the
plural
as
concretely
existing
men
actually
do
find
in
their
beliefs
as
we
humans
are
constituted
in
point
of
fact
we
find
that
to
believe
in
other
men
minds
in
independent
physical
realities
in
past
events
in
eternal
logical
relations
is
satisfactory
we
find
hope
satisfactory
we
often
find
it
satisfactory
to
cease
to
doubt
above
all
we
find
consistency
satisfactory
consistency
between
the
present
idea
and
the
entire
rest
of
our
mental
equipment
including
the
whole
order
of
our
sensations
and
that
of
our
intuitions
of
likeness
and
difference
and
our
whole
stock
of
previously
acquired
truths
the
pragmatist
being
himself
a
man
and
imagining
in
general
no
contrary
lines
of
truer
belief
than
ours
about
the
which
he
has
laid
at
the
base
of
his
epistemological
discussion
is
willing
to
treat
our
satisfactions
as
possibly
really
true
guides
to
it
not
as
guides
true
solely
for
us
it
would
seem
here
to
be
the
duty
of
his
critics
to
show
with
some
explicitness
why
being
our
subjective
feelings
these
satisfactions
can
not
yield
truth
the
beliefs
which
they
accompany
the
assumed
reality
and
with
it
and
it
in
perfectly
definite
and
assignable
ways
through
the
sequent
trains
of
thought
and
action
which
form
their
verification
so
merely
to
insist
on
using
these
words
abstractly
instead
of
concretely
is
no
way
of
driving
the
pragmatist
from
the
field
his
more
concrete
account
virtually
includes
his
critic
if
our
critics
have
any
definite
idea
of
a
truth
more
objectively
grounded
than
the
kind
we
propose
why
do
they
not
show
it
more
articulately
as
they
stand
they
remind
one
of
hegel
man
who
wanted
but
rejected
cherries
pears
and
grapes
because
they
were
not
fruit
in
the
abstract
we
offer
them
the
full
and
they
cry
for
the
empty
but
here
i
think
i
hear
some
critic
retort
as
follows
satisfactions
are
all
that
is
needed
to
make
truth
how
about
the
notorious
fact
that
errors
are
so
often
satisfactory
and
how
about
the
equally
notorious
fact
that
certain
true
beliefs
may
cause
the
bitterest
dissatisfaction
is
it
clear
that
not
the
satisfaction
which
it
gives
but
the
relation
of
the
belief
to
the
reality
is
all
that
makes
it
true
suppose
there
were
no
such
reality
and
that
the
satisfactions
yet
remained
would
they
not
then
effectively
work
falsehood
can
they
consequently
be
treated
distinctively
as
the
it
is
the
inherent
relation
to
reality
of
a
belief
that
gives
us
that
specific
compared
with
which
all
other
satisfactions
are
the
hollowest
humbug
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
truly
is
thus
the
only
one
which
the
pragmatist
ought
to
have
considered
as
a
psychological
sentiment
the
gladly
concedes
it
to
him
but
then
only
as
a
concomitant
of
truth
not
as
a
constituent
what
constitutes
truth
is
not
the
sentiment
but
the
purely
logical
or
objective
function
of
rightly
cognizing
the
reality
and
the
pragmatist
failure
to
reduce
this
function
to
lower
values
is
patent
such
as
this
seems
to
me
a
tissue
of
confusion
to
begin
with
when
the
pragmatist
says
it
confounds
this
with
the
pragmatist
calls
satisfactions
indispensable
for
but
i
have
everywhere
called
them
insufficient
unless
reality
be
also
incidentally
led
to
if
the
reality
assumed
were
cancelled
from
the
pragmatist
universe
of
discourse
he
would
straightway
give
the
name
of
falsehoods
to
the
beliefs
remaining
in
spite
of
all
their
satisfactoriness
for
him
as
for
his
critic
there
can
be
no
truth
if
there
is
nothing
to
be
true
about
ideas
are
so
much
flat
psychological
surface
unless
some
mirrored
matter
gives
them
cognitive
lustre
this
is
why
as
a
pragmatist
i
have
so
carefully
posited
ab
initio
and
why
throughout
my
whole
discussion
i
remain
an
epistemological
realist
footnote
i
need
hardly
remind
the
reader
that
both
and
percepts
of
ideal
relation
comparisons
etc
should
be
classed
among
the
realities
the
bulk
of
our
mental
consists
of
truths
concerning
these
terms
the
is
guilty
of
the
further
confusion
of
imagining
that
in
undertaking
to
give
him
an
account
of
what
truth
formally
means
we
are
assuming
at
the
same
time
to
provide
a
warrant
for
it
trying
to
define
the
occasions
when
he
can
be
sure
of
materially
possessing
it
our
making
it
hinge
on
a
reality
so
that
when
it
comes
truth
comes
and
when
it
goes
truth
goes
with
it
disappoints
this
naive
expectation
so
he
deems
our
description
unsatisfactory
i
suspect
that
under
this
confusion
lies
the
still
deeper
one
of
not
discriminating
sufficiently
between
the
two
notions
truth
and
reality
realities
are
not
true
they
are
and
beliefs
are
true
of
them
but
i
suspect
that
in
the
mind
the
two
notions
sometimes
swap
their
attributes
the
reality
itself
i
fear
is
treated
as
if
and
conversely
whoso
tells
us
of
the
one
it
is
then
supposed
must
also
be
telling
us
of
the
other
and
a
true
idea
must
in
a
manner
be
or
at
least
yield
without
extraneous
aid
the
reality
it
cognitively
is
possessed
of
to
this
demand
pragmatism
simply
opposes
its
non
possumus
if
there
is
to
be
truth
it
says
both
realities
and
beliefs
about
them
must
conspire
to
make
it
but
whether
there
ever
is
such
a
thing
or
how
anyone
can
be
sure
that
his
own
beliefs
possess
it
it
never
pretends
to
determine
that
par
excellence
which
may
tinge
a
belief
unsatisfactory
in
other
ways
it
easily
explains
as
the
feeling
of
consistency
with
the
stock
of
previous
truths
or
supposed
truths
of
which
one
whole
past
experience
may
have
left
one
in
possession
but
are
not
all
pragmatists
sure
that
their
own
belief
is
right
their
enemies
will
ask
at
this
point
and
this
leads
me
to
the
fifth
misunderstanding
what
pragmatists
say
is
inconsistent
with
their
saying
so
a
correspondent
puts
this
objection
as
follows
you
say
to
your
audience
pragmatism
is
the
truth
concerning
truth
the
first
truth
is
different
from
the
second
about
the
first
you
and
they
are
not
to
be
at
odds
you
are
not
giving
them
liberty
to
take
or
leave
it
according
as
it
works
satisfactorily
or
not
for
their
private
uses
yet
the
second
truth
which
ought
to
describe
and
include
the
first
affirms
this
liberty
thus
the
intent
of
your
utterance
seems
to
contradict
the
content
of
it
general
scepticism
has
always
received
this
same
classic
refutation
have
to
dogmatize
the
rationalists
say
to
the
sceptics
whenever
you
express
the
sceptical
position
so
your
lives
keep
contradicting
your
thesis
one
would
suppose
that
the
impotence
of
so
hoary
an
argument
to
abate
in
the
slightest
degree
the
amount
of
general
scepticism
in
the
world
might
have
led
some
rationalists
themselves
to
doubt
whether
these
instantaneous
logical
refutations
are
such
fatal
ways
after
all
of
killing
off
live
mental
attitudes
general
scepticism
is
the
live
mental
attitude
of
refusing
to
conclude
it
is
a
permanent
torpor
of
the
will
renewing
itself
in
detail
towards
each
successive
thesis
that
offers
and
you
can
no
more
kill
it
off
by
logic
than
you
can
kill
off
obstinacy
or
practical
joking
this
is
why
it
is
so
irritating
your
consistent
sceptic
never
puts
his
scepticism
into
a
formal
proposition
he
simply
chooses
it
as
a
habit
he
provokingly
hangs
back
when
he
might
so
easily
join
us
in
saying
yes
but
he
is
not
illogical
or
stupid
on
the
contrary
he
often
impresses
us
by
his
intellectual
superiority
this
is
the
real
scepticism
that
rationalists
have
to
meet
and
their
logic
does
not
even
touch
it
no
more
can
logic
kill
the
pragmatist
behavior
his
act
of
utterance
so
far
from
contradicting
accurately
exemplifies
the
matter
which
he
utters
what
is
the
matter
which
he
utters
in
part
it
is
this
that
truth
concretely
considered
is
an
attribute
of
our
beliefs
and
that
these
are
attitudes
that
follow
satisfactions
the
ideas
around
which
the
satisfactions
cluster
are
primarily
only
hypotheses
that
challenge
or
summon
a
belief
to
come
and
take
its
stand
upon
them
the
pragmatist
idea
of
truth
is
just
such
a
challenge
he
finds
it
to
accept
it
and
takes
his
own
stand
accordingly
but
being
gregarious
as
they
are
men
seek
to
spread
their
beliefs
to
awaken
imitation
to
infect
others
why
should
not
you
also
find
the
same
belief
satisfactory
thinks
the
pragmatist
and
forthwith
endeavors
to
convert
you
you
and
he
will
then
believe
similarly
you
will
hold
up
your
of
a
truth
which
will
be
a
truth
objective
and
irreversible
if
the
reality
holds
up
the
by
being
itself
present
simultaneously
what
there
is
of
in
all
this
i
confess
i
can
not
discover
the
pragmatist
conduct
in
his
own
case
seems
to
me
on
the
contrary
admirably
to
illustrate
his
universal
formula
and
of
all
epistemologists
he
is
perhaps
the
only
one
who
is
irreproachably
sixth
misunderstanding
pragmatism
explains
not
what
truth
is
but
only
how
it
is
arrived
at
in
point
of
fact
it
tells
us
both
tells
us
what
it
is
incidentally
to
telling
us
how
it
is
arrived
at
for
what
is
arrived
at
except
just
what
the
truth
is
if
i
tell
you
how
to
get
to
the
railroad
station
do
i
implicitly
introduce
you
to
the
what
to
the
being
and
nature
of
that
edifice
it
is
quite
true
that
the
abstract
word
the
same
meaning
as
the
abstract
word
but
in
this
universe
of
concrete
facts
you
can
not
keep
hows
and
whats
asunder
the
reasons
why
i
find
it
satisfactory
to
believe
that
any
idea
is
true
the
how
of
my
arriving
at
that
belief
may
be
among
the
very
reasons
why
the
idea
is
true
in
reality
if
not
i
summon
the
to
explain
the
impossibility
articulately
his
trouble
seems
to
me
mainly
to
arise
from
his
fixed
inability
to
understand
how
a
concrete
statement
can
possibly
mean
as
much
or
be
as
valuable
as
an
abstract
one
i
said
above
that
the
main
quarrel
between
us
and
our
critics
was
that
of
concreteness
versus
abstractness
this
is
the
place
to
develop
that
point
farther
in
the
present
question
the
links
of
experience
sequent
upon
an
idea
which
mediate
between
it
and
a
reality
form
and
for
the
pragmatist
indeed
are
the
concrete
relation
of
truth
that
may
obtain
between
the
idea
and
that
reality
they
he
says
are
all
that
we
mean
when
we
speak
of
the
idea
to
the
reality
it
with
it
or
with
it
they
or
other
similar
mediating
trains
of
verification
such
mediating
events
make
the
idea
the
idea
itself
if
it
exists
at
all
is
also
a
concrete
event
so
pragmatism
insists
that
truth
in
the
singular
is
only
a
collective
name
for
truths
in
the
plural
these
consisting
always
of
series
of
definite
events
and
that
what
intellectualism
calls
the
truth
the
inherent
truth
of
any
one
such
series
is
only
the
abstract
name
for
its
truthfulness
in
act
for
the
fact
that
the
ideas
there
do
lead
to
the
supposed
reality
in
a
way
that
we
consider
satisfactory
the
pragmatist
himself
has
no
objection
to
abstractions
elliptically
and
short
he
relies
on
them
as
much
as
any
one
ending
upon
innumerable
occasions
that
their
comparative
emptiness
makes
of
them
useful
substitutes
for
the
overfulness
of
the
facts
he
meets
with
but
he
never
ascribes
to
them
a
higher
grade
of
reality
the
full
reality
of
a
truth
for
him
is
always
some
process
of
verification
in
which
the
abstract
property
of
connecting
ideas
with
objects
truly
is
workingly
embodied
meanwhile
it
is
endlessly
serviceable
to
be
able
to
talk
of
properties
abstractly
and
apart
from
their
working
to
find
them
the
same
in
innumerable
cases
to
take
them
of
time
and
to
treat
of
their
relations
to
other
similar
abstractions
we
thus
form
whole
universes
of
platonic
ideas
ante
rem
universes
in
posse
tho
none
of
them
exists
effectively
except
in
rebus
countless
relations
obtain
there
which
nobody
experiences
as
obtaining
as
in
the
eternal
universe
of
musical
relations
for
example
the
notes
of
aennchen
von
tharau
were
a
lovely
melody
long
ere
mortal
ears
ever
heard
them
even
so
the
music
of
the
future
sleeps
now
to
be
awakened
hereafter
or
if
we
take
the
world
of
geometrical
relations
the
thousandth
decimal
of
sleeps
there
tho
no
one
may
ever
try
to
compute
it
or
if
we
take
the
universe
of
countless
coats
backs
and
countless
boots
feet
on
which
they
are
not
practically
fitted
countless
stones
gaps
in
walls
into
which
no
one
seeks
to
fit
them
actually
in
the
same
way
countless
opinions
realities
and
countless
truths
are
valid
tho
no
thinker
ever
thinks
them
for
the
these
prior
timeless
relations
are
the
presupposition
of
the
concrete
ones
and
possess
the
profounder
dignity
and
value
the
actual
workings
of
our
ideas
in
are
as
naught
in
comparison
with
the
of
this
discarnate
truth
within
them
for
the
pragmatist
on
the
contrary
all
discarnate
truth
is
static
impotent
and
relatively
spectral
full
truth
being
the
truth
that
energizes
and
does
battle
can
any
one
suppose
that
the
sleeping
quality
of
truth
would
ever
have
been
abstracted
or
have
received
a
name
if
truths
had
remained
forever
in
that
of
essential
timeless
and
had
never
been
embodied
in
any
panting
struggle
of
men
live
ideas
for
verification
surely
no
more
than
the
abstract
property
of
would
have
received
a
name
if
in
our
world
there
had
been
no
backs
or
feet
or
gaps
in
walls
to
be
actually
fitted
existential
truth
is
incidental
to
the
actual
competition
of
opinions
essential
truth
the
truth
of
the
intellectualists
the
truth
with
no
one
thinking
it
is
like
the
coat
that
fits
tho
no
one
has
ever
tried
it
on
like
the
music
that
no
ear
has
listened
to
it
is
less
real
not
more
real
than
the
verified
article
and
to
attribute
a
superior
degree
of
glory
to
it
seems
little
more
than
a
piece
of
perverse
as
well
might
a
pencil
insist
that
the
outline
is
the
essential
thing
in
all
pictorial
representation
and
chide
the
and
the
camera
for
omitting
it
forgetting
that
their
pictures
not
only
contain
the
whole
outline
but
a
hundred
other
things
in
addition
pragmatist
truth
contains
the
whole
of
intellectualist
truth
and
a
hundred
other
things
in
addition
intellectualist
truth
is
then
only
pragmatist
truth
in
posse
that
on
innumerable
occasions
men
do
substitute
truth
in
posse
or
verifiability
for
verification
or
truth
in
act
is
a
fact
to
which
no
one
attributes
more
importance
than
the
pragmatist
he
emphasizes
the
practical
utility
of
such
a
habit
but
he
does
not
on
that
account
consider
truth
in
posse
truth
not
alive
enough
ever
to
have
been
asserted
or
questioned
or
contradicted
to
be
the
metaphysically
prior
thing
to
which
truths
in
act
are
tributary
and
subsidiary
when
intellectualists
do
this
pragmatism
charges
them
with
inverting
the
real
relation
truth
in
posse
means
only
truths
in
act
and
he
insists
that
these
latter
take
precedence
in
the
order
of
logic
as
well
as
in
that
of
being
seventh
minunderstanding
pragmatism
ignores
the
theoretical
interest
this
would
seem
to
be
an
absolutely
wanton
slander
were
not
a
certain
excuse
to
be
found
in
the
linguistic
affinities
of
the
word
and
in
certain
offhand
habits
of
speech
of
ours
which
assumed
too
great
a
generosity
on
our
reader
part
when
we
spoke
of
the
meaning
of
ideas
consisting
in
their
consequences
or
of
the
differences
which
our
beliefs
make
to
us
when
we
said
that
the
truth
of
a
belief
consists
in
its
value
etc
our
language
evidently
was
too
careless
for
by
we
were
almost
unanimously
held
to
mean
opposed
to
theoretical
or
genuinely
cognitive
and
the
consequence
was
punctually
drawn
that
a
truth
in
our
eyes
could
have
no
relation
to
any
independent
reality
or
to
any
other
truth
or
to
anything
whatever
but
the
acts
which
we
might
ground
on
it
or
the
satisfactions
they
might
bring
the
mere
existence
of
the
idea
all
by
itself
if
only
its
results
were
satisfactory
would
give
full
truth
to
it
it
was
charged
in
our
absurd
pragmatist
epistemology
the
solemn
attribution
of
this
rubbish
to
us
was
also
encouraged
by
two
other
circumstances
first
ideas
are
practically
useful
in
the
narrow
sense
false
ideas
sometimes
but
most
often
ideas
which
we
can
verify
by
the
sum
total
of
all
their
leadings
and
the
reality
of
whose
objects
may
thus
be
considered
established
beyond
doubt
that
these
ideas
should
be
true
in
advance
of
and
apart
from
their
utility
that
in
other
words
their
objects
should
be
really
there
is
the
very
condition
of
their
having
that
kind
of
utility
the
objects
they
connect
us
with
are
so
important
that
the
ideas
which
serve
as
the
objects
substitutes
grow
important
also
this
manner
of
their
practical
working
was
the
first
thing
that
made
truths
good
in
the
eyes
of
primitive
men
and
buried
among
all
the
other
good
workings
by
which
true
beliefs
are
characterized
this
kind
of
subsequential
utility
remains
the
second
misleading
circumstance
was
the
emphasis
laid
by
schiller
and
dewey
on
the
fact
that
unless
a
truth
be
relevant
to
the
momentary
predicament
unless
it
be
germane
to
the
situation
meaning
by
this
the
quite
particular
perplexity
it
is
no
good
to
urge
it
it
does
meet
our
interests
any
better
than
a
falsehood
would
under
the
same
circumstances
but
why
our
predicaments
and
perplexities
might
not
be
theoretical
here
as
well
as
narrowly
practical
i
wish
that
our
critics
would
explain
they
simply
assume
that
no
pragmatist
can
admit
a
genuinely
theoretic
interest
having
used
the
phrase
of
an
idea
i
am
implored
by
one
correspondent
to
alter
it
every
one
thinks
you
mean
only
pecuniary
profit
and
loss
having
said
that
the
true
is
expedient
in
our
thinking
i
am
rebuked
in
this
wise
by
another
learned
correspondent
word
expedient
has
no
other
meaning
than
that
of
the
pursuit
of
this
has
ended
by
landing
a
number
of
officers
of
national
banks
in
penitentiaries
a
philosophy
that
leads
to
such
results
must
be
unsound
but
the
word
is
so
habitually
loosely
used
that
more
indulgence
might
have
been
expected
when
one
says
that
a
sick
man
has
now
practically
recovered
or
that
an
enterprise
has
practically
failed
one
usually
means
i
just
the
opposite
of
practically
in
the
literal
sense
one
means
that
altho
untrue
in
strict
practice
what
one
says
is
true
in
theory
true
virtually
certain
to
be
true
again
by
the
practical
one
often
means
the
distinctively
concrete
the
individual
particular
and
effective
as
opposed
to
the
abstract
general
and
inert
to
speak
for
myself
whenever
i
have
emphasized
the
practical
nature
of
truth
this
is
mainly
what
has
been
in
my
mind
are
things
in
their
plurality
and
in
that
early
california
address
when
i
described
pragmatism
as
holding
that
the
meaning
of
any
proposition
can
always
be
brought
down
to
some
particular
consequence
in
our
future
practical
experience
whether
passive
or
active
expressly
added
these
qualifying
words
the
point
lying
rather
in
the
fact
that
the
experience
must
be
particular
than
in
the
fact
that
it
must
be
active
by
meaning
here
in
the
narrow
literal
sense
footnote
the
ambiguity
of
the
word
comes
out
well
in
these
words
of
a
recent
reporter
of
our
views
is
an
reaction
against
the
intellectualism
and
rationalism
of
the
latin
mind
man
each
individual
man
is
the
measure
of
things
he
is
able
to
conceive
one
but
relative
truths
that
is
to
say
illusions
what
these
illusions
are
worth
is
revealed
to
him
not
by
general
theory
but
by
individual
practice
pragmatism
which
consists
in
experiencing
these
illusions
of
the
mind
and
obeying
them
by
acting
them
out
is
a
philosophy
without
words
a
philosophy
of
gestures
and
of
acts
which
abandons
what
is
general
and
olds
only
to
what
is
particular

but
particular
consequences
can
perfectly
well
be
of
a
theoretic
nature
every
remote
fact
which
we
infer
from
an
idea
is
a
particular
theoretic
consequence
which
our
mind
practically
works
towards
the
loss
of
every
old
opinion
of
ours
which
we
see
that
we
shall
have
to
give
up
if
a
new
opinion
be

in
breathing
freely
the
greatest
of
all
his
interests
because
it
never
fluctuates
or
remits
as
most
of
his
physical
interests
do
is
his
interest
in
consistency
in
feeling
that
what
he
now
thinks
goes
with
what
he
thinks
on
other
occasions
we
tirelessly
compare
truth
with
truth
for
this
sole
purpose
is
the
present
candidate
for
belief
perhaps
contradicted
by
principle
number
one
is

compatible
with

number
two
and
so
forth
the
particular
operations
here
are
the
purely
logical
ones
of
analysis
deduction
comparison
etc
and
altho
general
terms
may
be
used
ad
libitum
the
satisfactory
practical
working
of
the
candidate
idea
consists
in
the
consciousness
yielded
by
each
successive
theoretic
consequence
in
particular
it
is
therefore
simply
idiotic
to
repeat
that
pragmatism
takes
no
account
of
purely
theoretic
interests
all
it
insists
on
is
that
verity
in
act
means
verifications
and
that
these
are
always
particulars
even
in
exclusively
theoretic
matters
it
insists
that
vagueness
and
generality
serve
to
verify
nothing
eighth
misunderstanding
pragmatism
is
shut
up
to
solipsism
i
have
already
said
something
about
this
misconception
under
the
third
and
fourth
heads
above
but
a
little
more
may
be
helpful
the
objection
is
apt
to
clothe
itself
in
words
like
these
make
truth
to
consist
in
every
value
except
the
cognitive
value
proper
you
always
leave
your
knower
at
many
removes
or
at
the
uttermost
at
one
remove
from
his
real
object
the
best
you
do
is
to
let
his
ideas
carry
him
towards
it
it
remains
forever
outside
of
him
etc
i
think
that
the
leaven
working
here
is
the
rooted
intellectualist
persuasion
that
to
know
a
reality
an
idea
must
in
some
inscrutable
fashion
possess
or
be
it
footnote
sensations
may
indeed
possess
their
objects
or
coalesce
with
them
as
common
sense
supposes
that
they
do
and
intuited
differences
between
concepts
may
coalesce
with
the
objective
differences
but
to
simplify
our
discussion
here
we
can
afford
to
abstract
from
these
very
special
cases
of
knowing
for
pragmatism
this
kind
of
coalescence
is
inessential
as
a
rule
our
cognitions
are
only
processes
of
mind
off
their
balance
and
in
motion
towards
real
termini
and
the
reality
of
the
termini
believed
in
by
the
states
of
mind
in
question
can
be
guaranteed
only
by
some
wider
knower
footnote
the
transcendental
idealist
thinks
that
in
some
inexplicable
way
the
finite
states
of
mind
are
identical
with
the
transfinite
which
he
finds
himself
obliged
to
postulate
in
order
to
supply
a
fundamentum
far
the
relation
of
knowing
as
he
apprehends
it
pragmatists
can
leave
the
question
of
identity
open
but
they
can
not
do
without
the
wider
knower
any
more
than
they
can
do
without
the
reality
if
they
want
to
prove
a
case
of
knowing
they
themselves
play
the
part
of
the
absolute
knower
for
the
universe
of
discourse
which
serves
them
as
material
for
epistemologizing
they
warrant
the
reality
there
and
the
subject
true
knowledge
there
of
it
but
whether
what
they
themselves
say
about
that
whole
universe
is
objectively
true
whether
the
pragmatic
theory
of
truth
is
true
really
they
can
not
warrant
they
can
only
believe
it
to
their
hearers
they
can
only
propose
it
as
i
propose
it
to
my
readers
as
something
to
be
verified
ambulando
or
by
the
way
is
which
its
consequences
may
confirm
it
but
if
there
is
no
reason
extant
in
the
universe
why
they
should
be
doubted
the
beliefs
are
true
in
the
only
sense
in
which
anything
can
be
true
anyhow
they
are
practically
and
concretely
true
namely
true
in
the
mystical
mongrel
sense
of
an
identitatsphilosophie
they
need
not
be
nor
is
there
any
intelligible
reason
why
they
ever
need
be
true
otherwise
than
verifiably
and
practically
it
is
reality
part
to
possess
its
own
existence
it
is
thought
part
to
get
into
with
it
by
innumerable
paths
of
verification
i
fear
that
the
developments
of
pragmatism
may
cause
a
certain
difficulty
here
we
get
at
one
truth
only
through
the
rest
of
truth
and
the
reality
everlastingly
postulated
as
that
which
all
our
truth
must
keep
in
touch
with
may
never
be
given
to
us
save
in
the
form
of
truth
other
than
that
which
we
are
now
testing
but
since
schiller
has
shown
that
all
our
truths
even
the
most
elemental
are
affected
by
with
a
human
coefficient
reality
per
se
thus
may
appear
only
as
a
sort
of
limit
it
may
be
held
to
shrivel
to
the
mere
place
for
an
object
and
what
is
known
may
be
held
to
be
only
matter
of
our
psyche
that
we
fill
the
place
with
it
must
be
confessed
that
pragmatism
worked
in
this
humanistic
way
is
compatible
with
solipsism
it
joins
friendly
hands
with
the
agnostic
part
of
kantism
with
contemporary
agnosticism
and
with
idealism
generally
but
worked
thus
it
is
a
metaphysical
theory
about
the
matter
of
reality
and
flies
far
beyond
pragmatism
own
modest
analysis
of
the
nature
of
the
knowing
function
which
analysis
may
just
as
harmoniously
be
combined
with
less
humanistic
accounts
of
reality
one
of
pragmatism
merits
is
that
it
is
so
purely
epistemological
it
must
assume
realities
but
it
prejudges
nothing
as
to
their
constitution
and
the
most
diverse
metaphysics
can
use
it
as
their
foundation
it
certainly
has
no
special
affinity
with
solipsism
as
i
look
back
over
what
i
have
written
much
of
it
gives
me
a
queer
impression
as
if
the
obvious
were
set
forth
so
condescendingly
that
readers
might
well
laugh
at
my
pomposity
it
may
be
however
that
concreteness
as
radical
as
ours
is
not
so
obvious
the
whole
originality
of
pragmatism
the
whole
point
in
it
is
its
use
of
the
concrete
way
of
seeing
it
begins
with
concreteness
and
returns
and
ends
with
it
schiller
with
his
two
aspects
of
truth
relevancy
to
situation
and
subsequential
utility
is
only
filling
the
cup
of
concreteness
to
the
brim
for
us
once
seize
that
cup
and
you
can
not
misunderstand
pragmatism
it
seems
as
if
the
power
of
imagining
the
world
concretely
might
have
been
common
enough
to
let
our
readers
apprehend
us
better
as
if
they
might
have
read
between
our
lines
and
in
spite
of
all
our
infelicities
of
expression
guessed
a
little
more
correctly
what
our
thought
was
but
alas
this
was
not
on
programme

remarks
at
the
meeting
of
the
american
philosophical
association
cornell
university
december
my
account
of
truth
is
realistic
and
follows
the
epistemological
dualism
of
common
sense
suppose
i
say
to
you
thing
exists
is
that
true
or
not
how
can
you
tell
not
till
my
statement
has
developed
its
meaning
farther
is
it
determined
as
being
true
false
or
irrelevant
to
reality
altogether
but
if
now
you
ask
thing
and
i
reply
desk
if
you
ask
and
i
point
to
a
place
if
you
ask
it
exist
materially
or
only
in
imagination
and
i
say
if
moreover
i
say
mean
that
desk
and
then
grasp
and
shake
a
desk
which
you
see
just
as
i
have
described
it
you
are
willing
to
call
my
statement
true
but
you
and
i
are
commutable
here
we
can
exchange
places
and
as
you
go
bail
for
my
desk
so
i
can
go
bail
for
yours
this
notion
of
a
reality
independent
of
either
of
us
taken
from
ordinary
social
experience
lies
at
the
base
of
the
pragmatist
definition
of
truth
with
some
such
reality
any
statement
in
order
to
be
counted
true
must
agree
pragmatism
defines
to
mean
certain
ways
of
be
they
actual
or
potential
thus
for
my
statement
desk
exists
to
be
true
of
a
desk
recognized
as
real
by
you
it
must
be
able
to
lead
me
to
shake
your
desk
to
explain
myself
by
words
that
suggest
that
desk
to
your
mind
to
make
a
drawing
that
is
like
the
desk
you
see
etc
only
in
such
ways
as
this
is
there
sense
in
saying
it
agrees
with
that
reality
only
thus
does
it
gain
for
me
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
you
corroborate
me
reference
then
to
something
determinate
and
some
sort
of
adaptation
to
it
worthy
of
the
name
of
agreement
are
thus
constituent
elements
in
the
definition
of
any
statement
of
mine
as
you
can
not
get
at
either
the
reference
or
the
adaptation
without
using
the
notion
of
the
workings
that
the
thing
is
what
it
is
and
which
it
is
of
all
the
possible
things
with
that
what
are
points
determinable
only
by
the
pragmatic
method
the
means
a
possibility
of
pointing
or
of
otherwise
singling
out
the
special
object
the
means
choice
on
our
part
of
an
essential
aspect
to
conceive
it
by
and
this
is
always
relative
to
what
dewey
calls
our
own
and
the
means
our
assumption
of
the
attitude
of
belief
the
attitude
surely
for
understanding
what
the
word
means
as
applied
to
a
statement
the
mention
of
such
workings
is
indispensable
surely
if
we
leave
them
out
the
subject
and
the
object
of
the
cognitive
relation
the
same
universe
is
true
but
vaguely
and
ignorantly
and
without
mutual
contact
or
mediation
our
critics
nevertheless
call
the
workings
inessential
no
functional
possibilities
our
beliefs
true
they
say
they
are
true
inherently
true
positively
born
as
the
count
of
chambord
was
born
pragmatism
insists
on
the
contrary
that
statements
and
beliefs
are
thus
inertly
and
statically
true
only
by
courtesy
they
practically
pass
for
true
but
you
can
not
define
what
you
mean
by
calling
them
true
without
referring
to
their
functional
possibilities
these
give
its
whole
logical
content
to
that
relation
to
reality
on
a
belief
part
to
which
the
name
is
applied
a
relation
which
otherwise
remains
one
of
mere
coexistence
or
bare
withness
the
foregoing
statements
reproduce
the
essential
content
of
the
lecture
on
truth
in
my
book
pragmatism
schiller
doctrine
of
dewey
in
logical
theory
and
my
own
empiricism
all
involve
this
general
notion
of
truth
as
either
actual
or
conceivable
but
they
envelop
it
as
only
one
detail
in
the
midst
of
much
wider
theories
that
aim
eventually
at
determining
the
notion
of
what
at

was
meant
the
conditions
of
truth
thus
seem
incomplete
in
this
universe
of
discourse
so
that
it
must
be
enlarged
transcendentalists
enlarge
it
by
invoking
an
absolute
mind
which
as
it
owns
all
the
facts
can
sovereignly
correlate
them
if
it
intends
that
my
statement
shall
refer
to
that
identical
caesar
and
that
the
attributes
i
have
in
mind
shall
mean
his
attributes
that
intention
suffices
to
make
the
statement
true
i
in
turn
enlarge
the
universe
by
admitting
finite
intermediaries
between
the
two
original
facts
caesar
had
and
my
statement
has
effects
and
if
these
effects
in
any
way
run
together
a
concrete
medium
and
bottom
is
provided
for
the
determinate
cognitive
relation
which
as
a
pure
actio
in
distans
seemed
to
float
too
vaguely
and
unintelligibly
the
real
caesar
for
example
wrote
a
manuscript
of
which
i
see
a
real
reprint
and
say
caesar
i
mean
is
the
author
of
that
the
workings
of
my
thought
thus
determine
both
its
denotative
and
its
connotative
significance
more
fully
it
now
defines
itself
as
neither
irrelevant
to
the
real
caesar
nor
false
in
what
it
suggests
of
him
the
absolute
mind
seeing
me
thus
working
towards
caesar
through
the
cosmic
intermediaries
might
well
say
workings
only
specify
in
detail
what
i
meant
myself
by
the
statement
being
true
i
decree
the
cognitive
relation
between
the
two
original
facts
to
mean
that
just
that
kind
of
concrete
chain
of
intermediaries
exists
or
can
exist
but
the
chain
involves
facts
prior
to
the
statement
the
logical
conditions
of
whose
truth
we
are
defining
and
facts
subsequent
to
it
and
this
circumstance
coupled
with
the
vulgar
employment
of
the
terms
truth
and
fact
as
synonyms
has
laid
my
account
open
to
misapprehension
it
is
confusedly
asked
caesar
existence
a
truth
already
years
old
depend
for
its
truth
on
anything
about
to
happen
now
how
can
my
acknowledgment
of
it
be
made
true
by
the
acknowledgment
own
effects
the
effects
may
indeed
confirm
my
belief
but
the
belief
was
made
true
already
by
the
fact
that
caesar
really
did
exist
well
be
it
so
for
if
there
were
no
caesar
there
could
of
course
be
no
positive
truth
about
him
but
then
distinguish
between
as
being
positively
and
completely
so
established
and
as
being
so
only
elliptically
and
by
courtesy
in
the
sense
of
not
being
positively
irrelevant
or
untrue
remember
also
that
having
existed
in
fact
may
make
a
present
statement
false
or
irrelevant
as
well
as
it
may
make
it
true
and
that
in
neither
case
does
it
itself
have
to
alter
it
being
given
whether
truth
untruth
or
irrelevancy
shall
be
also
given
depends
on
something
coming
from
the
statement
itself
what
pragmatism
contends
for
is
that
you
can
not
adequately
define
the
something
if
you
leave
the
notion
of
the
functional
workings
out
of
your
account
truth
meaning
agreement
with
reality
the
mode
of
the
agreeing
is
a
practical
problem
which
the
subjective
term
of
the
relation
alone
can
solve
note
this
paper
was
originally
followed
by
a
couple
of
paragraphs
meant
to
conciliate
the
intellectualist
opposition
since
you
love
the
word
so
and
since
you
despise
so
the
concrete
working
of
our
ideas
i
said
keep
the
word
for
the
saltatory
and
incomprehensible
relation
you
care
so
much
for
and
i
will
say
of
thoughts
that
know
their
objects
in
an
intelligible
sense
that
they
are
like
most
offerings
this
one
has
been
spurned
so
i
revoke
it
repenting
of
my
generosity
professor
pratt
in
his
recent
book
calls
any
objective
state
of

truth
and
uses
the
word
in

as
proposed
by
me

see
below
page
uses
in
the
same
sense
apart
from
the
general
evil
of
ambiguous
vocabularies
we
may
really
forsake
all
hope
if
the
term
is
officially
to
lose
its
status
as
a
property
of
our
beliefs
and
opinions
and
become
recognized
as
a
technical
synonym

and

strenuous
life
footnote
reprinted
from
the
journal
of
philosophy
professor
a
brown
in
the
journal
for
august
approves
my
pragmatism
for
allowing
that
a
belief
in
the
absolute
may
give
holidays
to
the
spirit
but
takes
me
to
task
for
the
narrowness
of
this
concession
and
shows
by
striking
examples
how
great
a
power
the
same
belief
may
have
in
letting
loose
the
strenuous
life
i
have
no
criticism
whatever
to
make
upon
his
excellent
article
but
let
me
explain
why
holidays
were
the
only
gift
of
the
absolute
which
i
picked
out
for
emphasis
i
was
primarily
concerned
in
my
lectures
with
contrasting
the
belief
that
the
world
is
still
in
process
of
making
with
the
belief
that
there
is
an
edition
of
it
and
complete
the
former
or
belief
was
the
one
that
my
pragmatism
favored
both
beliefs
confirm
our
strenuous
moods
pluralism
actually
demands
them
since
it
makes
the
world
salvation
depend
upon
the
energizing
of
its
several
parts
among
which
we
are
monism
permits
them
for
however
furious
they
may
be
we
can
always
justify
ourselves
in
advance
for
indulging
them
by
the
thought
that
they
will
have
been
expressions
of
the
absolute
perfect
life
by
escaping
from
your
finite
perceptions
to
the
conception
of
the
eternal
whole
you
can
hallow
any
tendency
whatever
tho
the
absolute
dictates
nothing
it
will
sanction
anything
and
everything
after
the
fact
for
whatever
is
once
there
will
have
to
be
regarded
as
an
integral
member
of
the
universe
perfection
quietism
and
frenzy
thus
alike
receive
the
absolute
permit
to
exist
those
of
us
who
are
naturally
inert
may
abide
in
our
resigned
passivity
those
whose
energy
is
excessive
may
grow
more
reckless
still
history
shows
how
easily
both
quietists
and
fanatics
have
drawn
inspiration
from
the
absolutistic
scheme
it
suits
sick
souls
and
strenuous
ones
equally
well
one
can
not
say
thus
of
pluralism
its
world
is
always
vulnerable
for
some
part
may
go
astray
and
having
no
edition
of
it
to
draw
comfort
from
its
partisans
must
always
feel
to
some
degree
insecure
if
as
pluralists
we
grant
ourselves
moral
holidays
they
can
only
be
provisional
intended
to
refresh
us
for
the
fight
this
forms
one
permanent
inferiority
of
pluralism
from
the
pragmatic
point
of
view
it
has
no
saving
message
for
incurably
sick
souls
absolutism
among
its
other
messages
has
that
message
and
is
the
only
scheme
that
has
it
necessarily
that
constitutes
its
chief
superiority
and
is
the
source
of
its
religious
power
that
is
why
desiring
to
do
it
full
justice
i
valued
its
aptitude
for
giving
so
highly
its
claims
in
that
way
are
unique
whereas
its
affinities
with
strenuousness
are
less
emphatic
than
those
of
the
pluralistic
scheme
in
the
last
lecture
of
my
book
i
candidly
admitted
this
inferiority
of
pluralism
it
lacks
the
wide
indifference
that
absolutism
shows
it
is
bound
to
disappoint
many
sick
souls
whom
absolutism
can
console
it
seems
therefore
poor
tactics
for
absolutists
to
make
little
of
this
advantage
the
needs
of
sick
souls
are
surely
the
most
urgent
and
believers
in
the
absolute
should
rather
hold
it
to
be
great
merit
in
their
philosophy
that
it
can
meet
them
so
well
the
pragmatism
or
pluralism
which
i
defend
has
to
fall
back
on
a
certain
ultimate
hardihood
a
certain
willingness
to
live
without
assurances
or
guarantees
to
minds
thus
willing
to
live
on
possibilities
that
are
not
certainties
quietistic
religion
sure
of
salvation
any
how
has
a
slight
flavor
of
fatty
degeneration
about
it
which
has
caused
it
to
be
looked
askance
on
even
in
the
church
which
side
is
right
here
who
can
say
within
religion
emotion
is
apt
to
be
tyrannical
but
philosophy
must
favor
the
emotion
that
allies
itself
best
with
the
whole
body
and
drift
of
all
the
truths
in
sight
i
conceive
this
to
be
the
more
strenuous
type
of
emotion
but
i
have
to
admit
that
its
inability
to
let
loose
quietistic
raptures
is
a
serious
deficiency
in
the
pluralistic
philosophy

le

by

critique
emile
nourry
pp
professor
marcel
hebert
is
a
singularly
erudite
and
liberal
thinker
a
seceder
i
believe
from
the
catholic
priesthood
and
an
uncommonly
direct
and
clear
writer
his
book
le
divin
is
one
of
the
ablest
reviews
of
the
general
subject
of
religious
philosophy
which
recent
years
have
produced
and
in
the
small
volume
the
title
of
which
is
copied
above
he
has
perhaps
taken
more
pains
not
to
do
injustice
to
pragmatism
than
any
of
its
numerous
critics
yet
the
usual
fatal
misapprehension
of
its
purposes
vitiates
his
exposition
and
his
critique
his
pamphlet
seems
to
me
to
form
a
worthy
hook
as
it
were
on
which
to
hang
one
more
attempt
to
tell
the
reader
what
the
pragmatist
account
of
truth
really
means
hebert
takes
it
to
mean
what
most
people
take
it
to
mean
the
doctrine
namely
that
whatever
proves
subjectively
expedient
in
the
way
of
our
thinking
is
in
the
absolute
and
unrestricted
sense
of
the
word
whether
it
corresponds
to
any
objective
state
of
things
outside
of
our
thought
or
not
assuming
this
to
be
the
pragmatist
thesis
hebert
opposes
it
at
length
thought
that
proves
itself
to
be
thus
expedient
may
indeed
have
every
other
kind
of
value
for
the
thinker
he
says
but
cognitive
value
representative
value
valeur
de
connaissance
proprement
dite
it
has
not
and
when
it
does
have
a
high
degree
of
general
utility
value
this
is
in
every
case
derived
from
its
previous
value
in
the
way
of
correctly
representing
independent
objects
that
have
an
important
influence
on
our
lives
only
by
thus
representing
things
truly
do
we
reap
the
useful
fruits
but
the
fruits
follow
on
the
truth
they
do
not
constitute
it
so
hebert
accuses
pragmatism
of
telling
us
everything
about
truth
except
what
it
essentially
is
he
admits
indeed
that
the
world
is
so
framed
that
when
men
have
true
ideas
of
realities
consequential
utilities
ensue
in
abundance
and
no
one
of
our
critics
i
think
has
shown
as
concrete
a
sense
of
the
variety
of
these
utilities
as
he
has
but
he
reiterates
that
whereas
such
utilities
are
secondary
we
insist
on
treating
them
as
primary
and
that
the
connaissance
objective
from
which
they
draw
all
their
being
is
something
which
we
neglect
exclude
and
destroy
the
utilitarian
value
and
the
strictly
cognitive
value
of
our
ideas
may
perfectly
well
harmonize
he
says
and
in
the
main
he
allows
that
they
do
harmonize
but
they
are
not
logically
identical
for
that
he
admits
that
subjective
interests
desires
impulses
may
even
have
the
active
in
our
intellectual
life
cognition
awakens
only
at
their
spur
and
follows
their
cues
and
aims
yet
when
it
is
awakened
it
is
objective
cognition
proper
and
not
merely
another
name
for
the
impulsive
tendencies
themselves
in
the
state
of
satisfaction
the
owner
of
a
picture
ascribed
to
corot
gets
uneasy
when
its
authenticity
is
doubted
he
looks
up
its
origin
and
is
reassured
but
his
uneasiness
does
not
make
the
proposition
false
any
more
than
his
relief
makes
the
proposition
true
that
the
actual
corot
was
the
painter
pragmatism
which
according
to
hebert
claims
that
our
sentiments
make
truth
and
falsehood
would
oblige
us
to
conclude
that
our
minds
exert
no
genuinely
cognitive
function
whatever
this
subjectivist
interpretation
of
our
position
seems
to
follow
from
my
having
happened
to
write
without
supposing
it
necessary
to
explain
that
i
was
treating
of
cognition
solely
on
its
subjective
side
that
in
the
long
run
the
true
is
the
expedient
in
the
way
of
our
thinking
much
as
the
good
is
the
expedient
in
the
way
of
our
behavior
having
previously
written
that
truth
means
with
reality
and
insisted
that
the
chief
part
of
the
expediency
of
any
one
opinion
is
its
agreement
with
the
rest
of
acknowledged
truth
i
apprehended
no
exclusively
subjectivistic
reading
of
my
meaning
my
mind
was
so
filled
with
the
notion
of
objective
reference
that
i
never
dreamed
that
my
hearers
would
let
go
of
it
and
the
very
last
accusation
i
expected
was
that
in
speaking
of
ideas
and
their
satisfactions
i
was
denying
realities
outside
my
only
wonder
now
is
that
critics
should
have
found
so
silly
a
personage
as
i
must
have
seemed
in
their
eyes
worthy
of
explicit
refutation
the
object
for
me
is
just
as
much
one
part
of
reality
as
the
idea
is
another
part
the
truth
of
the
idea
is
one
relation
of
it
to
the
reality
just
as
its
date
and
its
place
are
other
relations
all
three
relations
consist
of
intervening
parts
of
the
universe
which
can
in
every
particular
case
be
assigned
and
catalogued
and
which
differ
in
every
instance
of
truth
just
as
they
differ
with
every
date
and
place
the
pragmatist
thesis
as
schiller
and
i
hold
it
i
prefer
to
let
professor
dewey
speak
for
himself
is
that
the
relation
called
is
thus
concretely
definable
ours
is
the
only
articulate
attempt
in
the
field
to
say
positively
what
truth
actually
consists
of
our
denouncers
have
literally
nothing
to
oppose
to
it
as
an
alternative
for
them
when
an
idea
is
true
it
is
true
and
there
the
matter
terminates
the
word
being
indefinable
the
relation
of
the
true
idea
to
its
object
being
as
they
think
unique
it
can
be
expressed
in
terms
of
nothing
else
and
needs
only
to
be
named
for
any
one
to
recognize
and
understand
it
moreover
it
is
invariable
and
universal
the
same
in
every
single
instance
of
truth
however
diverse
the
ideas
the
realities
and
the
other
relations
between
them
may
be
our
pragmatist
view
on
the
contrary
is
that
the
is
a
definitely
experienceable
relation
and
therefore
describable
as
well
as
namable
that
it
is
not
unique
in
kind
and
neither
invariable
nor
universal
the
relation
to
its
object
that
makes
an
idea
true
in
any
given
instance
is
we
say
embodied
in
intermediate
details
of
reality
which
lead
towards
the
object
which
vary
in
every
instance
and
which
in
every
instance
can
be
concretely
traced
the
chain
of
workings
which
an
opinion
sets
up
is
the
opinion
truth
falsehood
or
irrelevancy
as
the
case
may
be
every
idea
that
a
man
has
works
some
consequences
in
him
in
the
shape
either
of
bodily
actions
or
of
other
ideas
through
these
consequences
the
man
relations
to
surrounding
realities
are
modified
he
is
carried
nearer
to
some
of
them
and
farther
from
others
and
gets
now
the
feeling
that
the
idea
has
worked
satisfactorily
now
that
it
has
not
the
idea
has
put
him
into
touch
with
something
that
fulfils
its
intent
or
it
has
not
this
something
is
the
man
object
primarily
since
the
only
realities
we
can
talk
about
are
such
the
pragmatist
whenever
he
says
means
in
the
first
instance
what
may
count
for
the
man
himself
as
a
reality
what
he
believes
at
the
moment
to
be
such
sometimes
the
reality
is
a
concrete
sensible
presence
the
idea
for
example
may
be
that
a
certain
door
opens
into
a
room
where
a
glass
of
beer
may
be
bought
if
opening
the
door
leads
to
the
actual
sight
and
taste
of
the
beer
the
man
calls
the
idea
true
or
his
idea
may
be
that
of
an
abstract
relation
say
of
that
between
the
sides
and
the
hypothenuse
of
a
triangle
such
a
relation
being
of
course
a
reality
quite
as
much
as
a
glass
of
beer
is
if
the
thought
of
such
a
relation
leads
him
to
draw
auxiliary
lines
and
to
compare
the
figures
they
make
he
may
at
last
perceiving
one
equality
after
another
see
the
relation
thought
of
by
a
vision
quite
as
particular
and
direct
as
was
the
taste
of
the
beer
if
he
does
so
he
calls
that
idea
also
true
his
idea
has
in
each
case
brought
him
into
closer
touch
with
a
reality
felt
at
the
moment
to
verify
just
that
idea
each
reality
verifies
and
validates
its
own
idea
exclusively
and
in
each
case
the
verification
consists
in
the
consequences
mental
or
physical
which
the
idea
was
able
to
set
up
these
differ
in
every
single
instance
they
never
transcend
experience
they
consist
of
particulars
mental
or
sensible
and
they
admit
of
concrete
description
in
every
individual
case
pragmatists
are
unable
to
see
what
you
can
possibly
mean
by
calling
an
idea
true
unless
you
mean
that
between
it
as
a
terminus
a
quo
in
some
one
mind
and
some
particular
reality
as
a
terminus
ad
quem
such
concrete
workings
do
or
may
intervene
their
direction
constitutes
the
idea
reference
to
that
reality
their
satisfactoriness
constitutes
its
adaptation
thereto
and
the
two
things
together
constitute
the
of
the
idea
for
its
possessor
without
such
intermediating
portions
of
concretely
real
experience
the
pragmatist
sees
no
materials
out
of
which
the
adaptive
relation
called
truth
can
be
built
up
the
view
is
that
the
workings
are
but
evidences
of
the
truth
previous
inherent
presence
in
the
idea
and
that
you
can
wipe
the
very
possibility
of
them
out
of
existence
and
still
leave
the
truth
of
the
idea
as
solid
as
ever
but
surely
this
is
not
a
of
truth
to
ours
it
is
the
renunciation
of
all
articulate
theory
it
is
but
a
claim
to
the
right
to
call
certain
ideas
true
anyhow
and
this
is
what
i
meant
above
by
saying
that
the
offer
us
no
real
alternative
and
that
our
account
is
literally
the
only
positive
theory
extant
what
meaning
indeed
can
an
idea
truth
have
save
its
power
of
adapting
us
either
mentally
or
physically
to
a
reality
how
comes
it
then
that
our
critics
so
uniformly
accuse
us
of
subjectivism
of
denying
the
reality
existence
it
comes
i
think
from
the
necessary
predominance
of
subjective
language
in
our
analysis
however
independent
and
elective
realities
may
be
we
can
talk
about
them
in
framing
our
accounts
of
truth
only
as
so
many
objects
but
the
process
of
experience
leads
men
so
continually
to
supersede
their
older
objects
by
newer
ones
which
they
find
it
more
satisfactory
to
believe
in
that
the
notion
of
an
absolute
reality
inevitably
arises
as
a
grenzbegriff
equivalent
to
that
of
an
object
that
shall
never
be
superseded
and
belief
in
which
shall
be
endgueltig
cognitively
we
thus
live
under
a
sort
of
rule
of
three
as
our
private
concepts
represent
the
to
which
they
lead
us
these
being
public
realities
independent
of
the
individual
so
these
may
in
turn
represent
realities
of
a
hypersensible
order
electrons
god
or
what
not
existing
independently
of
all
human
thinkers
the
notion
of
such
final
realities
knowledge
of
which
would
be
absolute
truth
is
an
outgrowth
of
our
cognitive
experience
from
which
neither
pragmatists
nor
escape
they
form
an
inevitable
regulative
postulate
in
every
one
thinking
our
notion
of
them
is
the
most
abundantly
suggested
and
satisfied
of
all
our
beliefs
the
last
to
suffer
doubt
the
difference
is
that
our
critics
use
this
belief
as
their
sole
paradigm
and
treat
any
one
who
talks
of
human
realities
as
if
he
thought
the
notion
of
reality
illegitimate
meanwhile
so
far
as
by
them
talked
of
is
only
a
human
object
they
postulate
it
just
as
we
postulate
it
and
if
we
are
subjectivists
they
are
so
no
less
realities
in
themselves
can
be
there
for
any
one
whether
pragmatist
or
only
by
being
believed
they
are
believed
only
by
their
notions
appearing
true
and
their
notions
appear
true
only
because
they
work
satisfactorily
satisfactorily
moreover
for
the
particular
thinker
purpose
there
is
no
idea
which
is
the
true
idea
of
anything
whose
is
the
true
idea
of
the
absolute
or
to
take
hebert
example
what
is
the
true
idea
of
a
picture
which
you
possess
it
is
the
idea
that
most
satisfactorily
meets
your
present
interest
the
interest
may
be
in
the
picture
place
its
age
its
its
subject
its
dimensions
its
authorship
its
price
its
merit
or
what
not
if
its
authorship
by
corot
have
been
doubted
what
will
satisfy
the
interest
aroused
in
you
at
that
moment
will
be
to
have
your
claim
to
own
a
corot
confirmed
but
if
you
have
a
normal
human
mind
merely
calling
it
a
corot
will
not
satisfy
other
demands
of
your
mind
at
the
same
time
for
them
to
be
satisfied
what
you
learn
of
the
picture
must
make
smooth
connection
with
what
you
know
of
the
rest
of
the
system
of
reality
in
which
the
actual
corot
played
his
part
hebert
accuses
us
of
holding
that
the
proprietary
satisfactions
of
themselves
suffice
to
make
the
belief
true
and
that
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
no
actual
corot
need
ever
have
existed
why
we
should
be
thus
cut
off
from
the
more
general
and
intellectual
satisfactions
i
know
not
but
whatever
the
satisfactions
may
be
intellectual
or
proprietary
they
belong
to
the
subjective
side
of
the
they
found
our
beliefs
our
beliefs
are
in
realities
if
no
realities
are
there
the
beliefs
are
false
but
if
realities
are
there
how
they
can
even
be
known
without
first
being
believed
or
how
believed
except
by
our
first
having
ideas
of
them
that
work
satisfactorily
pragmatists
find
it
impossible
to
imagine
they
also
find
it
impossible
to
imagine
what
makes
the
dogmatic
dixit
assurance
of
reality
more
credible
than
the
pragmatists
conviction
based
on
concrete
verifications
hebert
will
probably
agree
to
this
when
put
in
this
way
so
i
do
not
see
our
inferiority
to
him
in
the
matter
of
connaissance
proprement
dite
some
readers
will
say
that
altho
i
may
possibly
believe
in
realities
beyond
our
ideas
schiller
at
any
rate
does
not
this
is
a
great
misunderstanding
for
schiller
doctrine
and
mine
are
identical
only
our
exposition
follow
different
directions
he
starts
from
the
subjective
pole
of
the
chain
the
individual
with
his
beliefs
as
the
more
concrete
and
immediately
given
phenomenon
individual
claims
his
belief
to
be
true
schiller
says
what
does
he
mean
by
true
and
how
does
he
establish
the
claim
with
these
questions
we
embark
on
a
psychological
inquiry
to
be
true
it
appears
means
for
that
individual
to
work
satisfactorily
for
him
and
the
working
and
the
satisfaction
since
they
vary
from
case
to
case
admit
of
no
universal
description
what
works
is
true
and
represents
a
reality
for
the
individual
for
whom
it
works
if
he
is
infallible
the
reality
is
there
if
mistaken
it
is
not
there
or
not
there
as
he
thinks
it
we
all
believe
when
our
ideas
work
satisfactorily
but
we
do
yet
know
who
of
us
is
infallible
so
that
the
problem
of
truth
and
that
of
error
are
ebenburtig
and
arise
out
of
the
same
situations
schiller
remaining
with
the
fallible
individual
and
treating
only
of
seems
to
many
of
his
readers
to
ignore
altogether
but
that
is
because
he
seeks
only
to
tell
us
how
truths
are
attained
not
what
the
content
of
those
truths
when
attained
shall
be
it
may
be
that
the
truest
of
all
beliefs
shall
be
that
in
transsubjective
realities
it
certainly
seems
the
truest
for
no
rival
belief
is
as
voluminously
satisfactory
and
it
is
probably
schiller
own
belief
but
he
is
not
required
for
his
immediate
purpose
to
profess
it
still
less
is
he
obliged
to
assume
it
in
advance
as
the
basis
of
his
discussion
i
however
warned
by
the
ways
of
critics
adopt
different
tactics
i
start
from
the
of
the
chain
and
follow
it
in
the
opposite
direction
from
schiller
anticipating
the
results
of
the
general
of
mankind
i
begin
with
the
abstract
notion
of
an
objective
reality
i
postulate
it
and
ask
on
my
own
account
i
vouching
for
this
reality
what
would
make
any
one
else
idea
of
it
true
for
me
as
well
as
for
him
but
i
find
no
different
answer
from
that
which
schiller
gives
if
the
other
man
idea
leads
him
not
only
to
believe
that
the
reality
is
there
but
to
use
it
as
the
temporary
substitute
by
letting
it
evoke
adaptive
thoughts
and
acts
similar
to
those
which
the
reality
itself
would
provoke
then
it
is
true
in
the
only
intelligible
sense
true
through
its
particular
consequences
and
true
for
me
as
well
as
for
the
man
my
account
is
more
of
a
logical
definition
schiller
is
more
of
a
psychological
description
both
treat
an
absolutely
identical
matter
of
experience
only
they
traverse
it
in
opposite
ways
possibly
these
explanations
may
satisfy
hebert
whose
little
book
apart
from
the
false
accusation
of
subjectivism
gives
a
fairly
instructive
account
of
the
pragmatist
epistemology
xiii
abstractionism
and
abstract
concepts
such
as
elasticity
voluminousness
disconnectedness
are
salient
aspects
of
our
concrete
experiences
which
we
find
it
useful
to
single
out
useful
because
we
are
then
reminded
of
other
things
that
offer
those
same
aspects
and
if
the
aspects
carry
consequences
in
those
other
things
we
can
return
to
our
first
things
expecting
those
same
consequences
to
accrue
to
be
helped
to
anticipate
consequences
is
always
a
gain
and
such
being
the
help
that
abstract
concepts
give
us
it
is
obvious
that
their
use
is
fulfilled
only
when
we
get
back
again
into
concrete
particulars
by
their
means
bearing
the
consequences
in
our
minds
and
enriching
our
notion
of
the
original
objects
therewithal
without
abstract
concepts
to
handle
our
perceptual
particulars
by
we
are
like
men
hopping
on
one
foot
using
concepts
along
with
the
particulars
we
become
bipedal
we
throw
our
concept
forward
get
a
foothold
on
the
consequence
hitch
our
line
to
this
and
draw
our
percept
up
travelling
thus
with
a
hop
skip
and
jump
over
the
surface
of
life
at
a
vastly
rapider
rate
than
if
we
merely
waded
through
the
thickness
of
the
particulars
as
accident
rained
them
down
upon
our
heads
animals
have
to
do
this
but
men
raise
their
heads
higher
and
breathe
freely
in
the
upper
conceptual
air
the
enormous
esteem
professed
by
all
philosophers
for
the
conceptual
form
of
consciousness
is
easy
to
understand
from
time
downwards
it
has
been
held
to
be
our
sole
avenue
to
essential
truth
concepts
are
universal
changeless
pure
their
relations
are
eternal
they
are
spiritual
while
the
concrete
particulars
which
they
enable
us
to
handle
are
corrupted
by
the
flesh
they
are
precious
in
themselves
then
apart
from
their
original
use
and
confer
new
dignity
upon
our
life
one
can
find
no
fault
with
this
way
of
feeling
about
concepts
so
long
as
their
original
function
does
not
get
swallowed
up
in
the
admiration
and
lost
that
function
is
of
course
to
enlarge
mentally
our
momentary
experiences
by
adding
to
them
the
consequences
conceived
but
unfortunately
that
function
is
not
only
too
often
forgotten
by
philosophers
in
their
reasonings
but
is
often
converted
into
its
exact
opposite
and
made
a
means
of
diminishing
the
original
experience
by
denying
implicitly
or
explicitly
all
its
features
save
the
one
specially
abstracted
to
conceive
it
by
this
itself
is
a
highly
abstract
way
of
stating
my
complaint
and
it
needs
to
be
redeemed
from
obscurity
by
showing
instances
of
what
is
meant
some
beliefs
very
dear
to
my
own
heart
have
been
conceived
in
this
viciously
abstract
way
by
critics
one
is
the
to
believe
so
called
another
is
the
indeterminism
of
certain
futures
a
third
is
the
notion
that
truth
may
vary
with
the
standpoint
of
the
man
who
holds
it
i
believe
that
the
perverse
abuse
of
the
abstracting
function
has
led
critics
to
employ
false
arguments
against
these
doctrines
and
often
has
led
their
readers
to
false
conclusions
i
should
like
to
try
to
save
the
situation
if
possible
by
a
few
remarks
let
me
give
the
name
of
abstractionism
to
a
way
of
using
concepts
which
may
be
thus
described
we
conceive
a
concrete
situation
by
singling
out
some
salient
or
important
feature
in
it
and
classing
it
under
that
then
instead
of
adding
to
its
previous
characters
all
the
positive
consequences
which
the
new
way
of
conceiving
it
may
bring
we
proceed
to
use
our
concept
privatively
reducing
the
originally
rich
phenomenon
to
the
naked
suggestions
of
that
name
abstractly
taken
treating
it
as
a
case
of
but
that
concept
and
acting
as
if
all
the
other
characters
from
out
of
which
the
concept
is
abstracted
were
expunged
footnote
let
not
the
reader
confound
the
fallacy
here
described
with
legitimately
negative
inferences
such
as
those
drawn
in
the
mood
of
the
abstraction
functioning
in
this
way
becomes
a
means
of
arrest
far
more
than
a
means
of
advance
in
thought
it
mutilates
things
it
creates
difficulties
and
finds
impossibilities
and
more
than
half
the
trouble
that
metaphysicians
and
logicians
give
themselves
over
the
paradoxes
and
dialectic
puzzles
of
the
universe
may
i
am
convinced
be
traced
to
this
relatively
simple
source
the
viciously
privative
employment
of
abstract
characters
and
class
names
is
i
am
persuaded
one
of
the
great
original
sins
of
the
rationalistic
mind
to
proceed
immediately
to
concrete
examples
cast
a
glance
at
the
belief
in
will
demolished
with
such
specious
persuasiveness
recently
by
the
skilful
hand
of
professor

monthly

when
a
common
man
says
that
his
will
is
free
what
does
he
mean
he
means
that
there
are
situations
of
bifurcation
inside
of
his
life
in
which
two
futures
seem
to
him
equally
possible
for
both

their

equally
planted

his

grow
out

will
continue
uninterruptedly
the
pulsations
of

sometimes
both
at
once
are
incompatible
with
physical
nature

then
it
seems
to
the
naive

as
if
he
made
a

his

on
too
uniform
a
pattern
for
any
of

to
escape
successfully
from
acts
of
faith
we
have
a
lively
vision
of
what
a
certain
view
of
the
universe
would
mean
for
us
we
kindle
or
we
shudder
at
the
thought
and
our
feeling
runs
through
our
whole
logical
nature
and
animates
its
workings
it
ca
be
that
we
feel
it
must
be
this
it
must
be
what
it
ought
to
be
and
ought
to
be
this
and
then
we
seek
for
every
reason
good
or
bad
to
make
this
which
so
deeply
ought
to
be
seem
objectively
the
probable
thing
we
show
the
arguments
against
it
to
be
insufficient
so
that
it
may
be
true
we
represent
its
appeal
to
be
to
our
whole
loyalty
and
not
to
any
emaciated
faculty
of
syllogistic
proof
we
reinforce
it
by
remembering
the
enlargement
of
our
world
by
music
by
thinking
of
the
promises
of
sunsets
and
the
impulses
from
vernal
woods
and
the
essence
of
the
whole
experience
when
the
individual
swept
through
it
says
finally
believe
is
the
intense
concreteness
of
his
vision
the
individuality
of
the
hypothesis
before
him
and
the
complexity
of
the
various
concrete
motives
and
perceptions
that
issue
in
his
final
state
but
see
now
how
the
abstractionist
treats
this
rich
and
intricate
vision
that
a
certain
state
of
things
must
be
true
he
accuses
the
believer
of
reasoning
by
the
following
syllogism
all
good
desires
must
be
fulfilled
the
desire
to
believe
this
proposition
is
a
good
desire
ergo
this
proposition
must
be
believed
he
substitutes
this
abstraction
for
the
concrete
state
of
mind
of
the
believer
pins
the
naked
absurdity
of
it
upon
him
and
easily
proves
that
any
one
who
defends
him
must
be
the
greatest
fool
on
earth
as
if
any
real
believer
ever
thought
in
this
preposterous
way
or
as
if
any
defender
of
the
legitimacy
of
men
concrete
ways
of
concluding
ever
used
the
abstract
and
general
premise
desires
must
be
fulfilled
nevertheless
mctaggart
solemnly
and
laboriously
refutes
the
syllogism
in
sections
to
of
the
book
he
shows
that
there
is
no
fixed
link
in
the
dictionary
between
the
abstract
concepts
and
and
he
ignores
all
the
links
which
in
the
single
concrete
case
the
believer
feels
and
perceives
to
be
there
he
adds
the
reality
of
a
thing
is
uncertain
the
argument
encourages
us
to
suppose
that
our
approval
of
a
thing
can
determine
its
reality
and
when
this
unhallowed
link
has
once
been
established
retribution
overtakes
us
for
when
the
reality
of
the
thing
is
independently
certain
we
then
have
to
admit
that
the
reality
of
the
thing
should
determine
our
approval
of
that
thing
i
find
it
difficult
to
imagine
a
more
degraded
position
one
here
feels
tempted
to
quote
ironically
hegel
famous
equation
of
the
real
with
the
rational
to
his
english
disciple
who
ends
his
chapter
with
the
heroic
words
those
who
do
not
pray
there
remains
the
resolve
that
so
far
as
their
strength
may
permit
neither
the
pains
of
death
nor
the
pains
of
life
shall
drive
them
to
any
comfort
in
that
which
they
hold
to
be
false
or
drive
them
from
any
comfort
discomfort
in
that
which
they
hold
to
be
true
how
can
so
a
writer
fail
to
see
how
far
over
the
heads
of
the
enemy
all
his
arrows
pass
when
mctaggart
himself
believes
that
the
universe
is
run
by
the
dialectic
energy
of
the
absolute
idea
his
insistent
desire
to
have
a
world
of
that
sort
is
felt
by
him
to
be
no
chance
example
of
desire
in
general
but
an
altogether
peculiar
passion
to
which
in
this
if
in
no
other
instance
he
would
be
stupid
not
to
yield
he
obeys
its
concrete
singularity
not
the
bare
abstract
feature
in
it
of
being
a
his
situation
is
as
particular
as
that
of
an
actress
who
resolves
that
it
is
best
for
her
to
marry
and
leave
the
stage
of
a
priest
who
becomes
secular
of
a
politician
who
abandons
public
life
what
sensible
man
would
seek
to
refute
the
concrete
decisions
of
such
persons
by
tracing
them
to
abstract
premises
such
as
that
actresses
must
marry
clergymen
must
be
laymen
politicians
should
resign
their
posts
yet
this
type
of
refutation
absolutely
unavailing
though
it
be
for
purposes
of
conversion
is
spread
by
mctaggart
through
many
pages
of
his
book
for
the
aboundingness
of
our
real
reasons
he
substitutes
one
narrow
point
for
men
real
probabilities
he
gives
a
skeletonized
abstraction
which
no
man
was
ever
tempted
to
believe
the
abstraction
in
my
next
example
is
less
simple
but
is
quite
as
flimsy
as
a
weapon
of
attack

part

this

indeed
have

the

many
have
these
latter
been
among
the
most
onslaughts
on
the
attempt
to
introduce
some
concreteness
into
our
notion
of
what
the
truth
of
an
idea
may
mean
is
one
that
has
been
raised
in
many
quarters
to
the
effect
that
to
make
truth
grow
in
any
way
out
of
human
opinion
is
but
to
reproduce
that
protagorean
doctrine
that
the
individual
man
is
measure
of
all
things
which
plato
in
his
immortal
dialogue

is
unanimously
said
to
have
laid
away
so
comfortably

grave
two
thousand

entirely
in
the
air
they
accuse

we
pragmatists

typical
relativists

being
debarred

their
principles
not
only
from
the
privilege
which
rationalist
philosophers
enjoy
of
believing
that
these
principles
of
their
own
are
truth
impersonal
and
absolute
but
even
of
framing
the
abstract
notion
of
such
a

in
the
pragmatic
sense
of
an
ideal
opinion
in
which
all

might
agree

charges

in

own
account

truth
as
firmly
as
any
rationalist
can
possibly
believe
in
his
and
i
believe
in
it
for
the
very
reason
that
i
have
the
idea
of
truth
which
my
learned
adversaries
contend
that
no
pragmatist
can
frame
i
expect
namely
that
the
more
fully
men
discuss
and
test
my
account
the
more
they
will
agree
that
it
fits
and
the
less
will
they
desire
a
change
i
may
of
course
be
premature
in
this
confidence
and
the
glory
of
being
truth
final
and
absolute
may
fall
upon
some
later
revision
and
correction
of
my
scheme
which
later
will
then
be
judged
untrue
in
just
the
measure
in
which
it
departs
from
that
finally
satisfactory
formulation
to
admit
as
we
pragmatists
do
that
we
are
liable
to
correction
even
tho
we
may
not
expect
it
involves
the
use
on
our
part
of
an
ideal
standard
rationalists
themselves
are
as
individuals
sometimes
sceptical
enough
to
admit
the
abstract
possibility
of
their
own
present
opinions
being
corrigible
and
revisable
to
some
degree
so
the
fact
that
the
mere
notion
of
an
absolute
standard
should
seem
to
them
so
important
a
thing
to
claim
for
themselves
and
to
deny
to
us
is
not
easy
to
explain
if
along
with
the
notion
of
the
standard
they
could
also
claim
its
exclusive
warrant
for
their
own
fulminations
now
it
would
be
important
to
them
indeed
but
absolutists
like
rickert
freely
admit
the
sterility
of
the
notion
even
in
their
own
hands
truth
is
what
we
ought
to
believe
they
say
even
tho
no
man
ever
did
or
shall
believe
it
and
even
tho
we
have
no
way
of
getting
at
it
save
by
the
usual
empirical
processes
of
testing
our
opinions
by
one
another
and
by
facts
pragmatically
then
this
part
of
the
dispute
is
idle

denied
the
regulative
character
in
his
own
thinking

what
is

by

the
pretence

at

an
ideal
set

formulations
towards
which
all
opinions
may
in
the
long
run
of
experience
be
expected
to
converge
in
this
definition
of
absolute
truth
he
not
only
postulates
that
there
is
a
tendency
to
such
convergence
of
opinions
to
such
ultimate
consensus
but
he
postulates
the
other
factors
of
his
definition
equally
borrowing
them
by
anticipation
from
the
true
conclusions
expected
to
be
reached
he
postulates
the
existence
of
opinions
he
postulates
the
experience
that
will
sift
them
and
the
consistency
which
that
experience
will
show
he
justifies
himself
in
these
assumptions
by
saying
that
they
are
not
postulates
in
the
strict
sense
but
simple
inductions
from
the
past
extended
to
the

stable
equilibrium
regarding
them
and
that
if
its
future
development
fails
to
alter
them
the
definition
itself
with
all
its
terms
included
will
be
part
of
the
very
absolute
truth
which
it
defines
the
hypothesis
will
in
short
have
worked
successfully
all
round
the
circle
and
proved
and
the
circle
will
be
closed
the
however
immediately
falls
foul
of
the
word
here
abstracts
it
from
the
universe
of
life
and
uses
it
as
a
bare
to
deny
the
rest
of
the
assumptions
which
it
coexists
withal
the
dictionary
says
that
an
opinion
is
some
one
thinks
or
believes
this
definition
leaves
every
one
opinion
free
to
be
autogenous
or
unrelated
either
to
what
any
one
else
may
think
or
to
what
the
truth
may
be
therefore
continue
our
abstractionists
we
must
conceive
it
as
essentially
thus
unrelated
so
that
even
were
a
billion
men
to
sport
the
same
opinion
and
only
one
man
to
differ
we
could
admit
no
collateral
circumstances
which
might
presumptively
make
it
more
probable
that
he
not
they
should
be
wrong
truth
they
say
follows
not
the
counting
of
noses
nor
is
it
only
another
name
for
a
majority
vote
it
is
a
relation
that
antedates
experience
between
our
opinions
and
an
independent
something
which
the
pragmatist
account
ignores
a
relation
which
tho
the
opinions
of
individuals
should
to
all
eternity
deny
it
would
still
remain
to
qualify
them
as
false
to
talk
of
opinions
without
referring
to
this
independent
something
the
assures
us
is
to
play
hamlet
with
hamlet
part
left
out
but
when
the
pragmatist
speaks
of
opinions
does
he
mean
any
such
insulated
and
unmotived
abstractions
as
are
here
supposed
of
course
not
he
means
men
opinions
in
the
flesh
as
they
have
really
formed
themselves
opinions
surrounded
by
their
causes
and
the
influences
they
obey
and
exert
and
along
with
the
whole
environment
of
social
communication
of
which
they
are
a
part
and
out
of
which
they
take
their
rise
moreover
the
which
the
pragmatic
definition
postulates
is
the
independent
something
which
the
accuses
him
of
ignoring
already
have
men
grown
unanimous
in
the
opinion
that
such
experience
is
of
an
independent
reality
the
existence
of
which
all
opinions
must
acknowledge
in
order
to
be
true
already
do
they
agree
that
in
the
long
run
it
is
useless
to
resist
pressure
that
the
more
of
it
a
man
has
the
better
position
he
stands
in
in
respect
of
truth
that
some
men
having
had
more
experience
are
therefore
better
authorities
than
others
that
some
are
also
wiser
by
nature
and
better
able
to
interpret
the
experience
they
have
had
that
it
is
one
part
of
such
wisdom
to
compare
notes
discuss
and
follow
the
opinion
of
our
betters
and
that
the
more
systematically
and
thoroughly
such
comparison
and
weighing
of
opinions
is
pursued
the
truer
the
opinions
that
survive
are
likely
to
be
when
the
pragmatist
talks
of
opinions
it
is
opinions
as
they
thus
concretely
and
livingly
and
interactingly
and
correlatively
exist
that
he
has
in
mind
and
when
the
tries
to
floor
him
because
the
word
can
also
be
taken
abstractly
and
as
if
it
had
no
environment
he
simply
ignores
the
soil
out
of
which
the
whole
discussion
grows
his
weapons
cut
the
air
and
strike
no
blow
no
one
gets
wounded
in
the
war
against
caricatures
of
belief
and
skeletons
of
opinion
of
which
the
german
onslaughts
upon
consists
refuse
to
use
the
word
abstractly
keep
it
in
its
real
environment
and
the
withers
of
pragmatism
remain
unwrung
that
men
do
exist
who
are
in
the
sense
that
their
opinions
are
is
unfortunately
a
fact
that
must
be
admitted
no
matter
what
one
notion
of
truth
in
general
may
be
but
that
this
fact
should
make
it
impossible
for
truth
to
form
itself
authentically
out
of
the
life
of
opinion
is
what
no
critic
has
yet
proved
truth
may
well
consist
of
certain
opinions
and
does
indeed
consist
of
nothing
but
opinions
tho
not
every
opinion
need
be
true
no
pragmatist
needs
to
dogmatize
about
the
consensus
of
opinion
in
the
future
being
right
he
need
only
postulate
that
it
will
probably
contain
more
of
truth
than
any
one
opinion
now
xiv
two
english
critics
bertrand
russell
article
entitled
truth
footnote
in
the
albany
review
for
january
has
all
the
clearness
dialectic
subtlety
and
wit
which
one
expects
from
his
pen
but
it
entirely
fails
to
hit
the
right
point
of
view
for
apprehending
our
position
when
for
instance
we
say
that
a
true
proposition
is
one
the
consequences
of
believing
which
are
good
he
assumes
us
to
mean
that
any
one
who
believes
a
proposition
to
be
true
must
first
have
made
out
clearly
that
its
consequences
be
good
and
that
his
belief
must
primarily
be
in
that
fact
an
obvious
absurdity
for
that
fact
is
the
deliverance
of
a
new
proposition
quite
different
from
the
first
one
and
is
moreover
a
fact
usually
very
hard
to
verify
it
being
easier
as
russell
justly
says
settle
the
plain
question
of
fact
have
popes
always
been
infallible
than
to
settle
the
question
whether
the
effects
of
thinking
them
infallible
are
on
the
whole
good
we
affirm
nothing
as
silly
as
russell
supposes
good
consequences
are
not
proposed
by
us
merely
as
a
sure
sign
mark
or
criterion
by
which
truth
presence
is
habitually
ascertained
tho
they
may
indeed
serve
on
occasion
as
such
a
sign
they
are
proposed
rather
as
the
lurking
motive
inside
of
every
whether
the
be
conscious
of
such
motive
or
whether
he
obey
it
blindly
they
are
proposed
as
the
causa
existendi
of
our
beliefs
not
as
their
logical
cue
or
premise
and
still
less
as
their
objective
deliverance
or
content
they
assign
the
only
intelligible
practical
meaning
to
that
difference
in
our
beliefs
which
our
habit
of
calling
them
true
or
false
comports
no
except
the
pragmatist
himself
need
ever
be
aware
of
the
part
played
in
his
own
mind
by
consequences
and
he
himself
is
aware
of
it
only
abstractly
and
in
general
and
may
at
any
moment
be
quite
oblivious
of
it
with
respect
to
his
own
beliefs
russell
next
joins
the
army
of
those
who
inform
their
readers
that
according
to
the
pragmatist
definition
of
the
word
the
belief
that
a
exists
may
be
even
when
a
does
not
exist
this
is
the
usual
slander
repeated
to
satiety
by
our
critics
they
forget
that
in
any
concrete
account
of
what
is
denoted
by
in
human
life
the
word
can
only
be
used
relatively
to
some
particular
trower
thus
i
may
hold
it
true
that
shakespeare
wrote
the
plays
that
bear
his
name
and
may
express
my
opinion
to
a
critic
if
the
critic
be
both
a
pragmatist
and
a
baconian
he
will
in
his
capacity
of
pragmatist
see
plain
that
the
workings
of
my
opinion
i
being
who
i
am
make
it
perfectly
true
for
me
while
in
his
capacity
of
baconian
he
still
believes
that
shakespeare
never
wrote
the
plays
in
question
but
most
critics
take
the
wont
as
something
absolute
and
easily
play
on
their
reader
readiness
to
treat
his
owe
truths
as
the
absolute
ones
if
the
reader
whom
they
address
believes
that
a
does
not
exist
while
we
pragmatists
show
that
those
for
whom
tho
belief
that
it
exists
works
satisfactorily
will
always
call
it
true
he
easily
sneers
at
the
naivete
of
our
contention
for
is
not
then
the
belief
in
question
tho
what
it
declares
as
fact
has
as
the
reader
so
well
knows
no
existence
russell
speaks
of
our
statement
as
an
to
get
rid
of
and
naturally
enough
considers
it
failure
old
notion
of
truth
reappears
he
adds
that
notion
being
of
course
that
when
a
belief
is
true
its
object
does
exist
it
is
of
course
bound
to
exist
on
sound
pragmatic
principles
concepts
signify
consequences
how
is
the
world
made
different
for
me
by
my
conceiving
an
opinion
of
mine
under
the
concept
first
an
object
must
be
findable
there
or
sure
signs
of
such
an
object
must
be
found
which
shall
agree
with
the
opinion
second
such
an
opinion
must
not
be
contradicted
by
anything
else
i
am
aware
of
but
in
spite
of
the
obvious
pragmatist
requirement
that
when
i
have
said
truly
that
something
exists
it
shall
exist
the
slander
which
russell
repeats
has
gained
the
widest
currency
russell
himself
is
far
too
witty
and
athletic
a
ratiocinator
simply
to
repeat
the
slander
dogmatically
being
nothing
if
not
mathematical
and
logical
he
must
prove
the
accusation
secundum
artem
and
convict
us
not
so
much
of
error
as
of
absurdity
i
have
sincerely
tried
to
follow
the
windings
of
his
mind
in
this
procedure
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
can
only
see
in
it
another
example
of
what
i
have
called
above
vicious
abstractionism
the
abstract
world
of
mathematics
and
pure
logic
is
so
native
to
russell
that
he
thinks
that
we
describers
of
the
functions
of
concrete
fact
must
also
mean
fixed
mathematical
terms
and
functions
a
mathematical
term
as
a
b
c
x
y
is
and
terms
of
this
sort
once
equated
can
be
substituted
for
one
another
in
endless
series
without
error
russell
and
also
hawtrey
of
whom
i
shall
speak
presently
seem
to
think
that
in
our
mouth
also
such
terms
as
are
with
no
context
of
varying
relation
that
might
be
further
asked
about
what
a
word
means
is
expressed
by
its
definition
is
it
the
definition
claims
to
be
exact
and
adequate
does
it
then
it
can
be
substituted
for
the
word
since
the
two
are
identical
ca
it
then
two
words
with
the
same
definition
can
be
substituted
for
one
another
ce
pas
likewise
two
definitions
of
the
same
word
nicht
wahr
till
it
will
be
indeed
strange
if
you
ca
convict
some
one
of
and
absurdity
the
particular
application
of
this
rigoristic
treatment
to
my
own
little
account
of
truth
as
working
seems
to
be
something
like
what
follows
i
say
is
what
the
of
our
ideas
means
and
call
it
a
definition
but
since
meanings
and
things
meant
definitions
and
things
defined
are
equivalent
and
interchangeable
and
nothing
extraneous
to
its
definition
can
be
meant
when
a
term
is
used
it
follows
that
who
so
calls
an
idea
true
and
means
by
that
word
that
it
works
can
not
mean
anything
else
can
believe
nothing
but
that
it
does
work
and
in
particular
can
neither
imply
nor
allow
anything
about
its
object
or
deliverance
to
the
pragmatists
russell
writes
say
it
is
true
that
other
people
exist
means
it
is
useful
to
believe
that
other
people
exist
but
if
so
then
these
two
phrases
are
merely
different
words
for
the
same
proposition
therefore
when
i
believe
the
one
i
believe
the
other
logic
i
may
say
in
passing
would
seem
to
require
russell
to
believe
them
both
at
once
but
he
ignores
this
consequence
and
considers
that
other
people
exist
and
is
useful
to
believe
that
they
do
even
if
they
do
must
be
identical
and
therefore
substitutable
propositions
in
the
pragmatist
mouth
but
may
not
real
terms
i
now
ask
have
accidents
not
expressed
in
their
definitions
and
when
a
real
value
is
finally
substituted
for
the
result
of
an
algebraic
series
of
substituted
definitions
do
not
all
these
accidents
creep
back
beliefs
have
their
objective
or
as
well
as
their
truth
and
truth
has
its
implications
as
well
as
its
workings
if
any
one
believe
that
other
men
exist
it
is
both
a
content
of
his
belief
and
an
implication
of
its
truth
that
they
should
exist
in
fact
russell
logic
would
seem
to
exclude
definition
all
such
accidents
as
contents
implications
and
associates
and
would
represent
us
as
translating
all
belief
into
a
sort
of
belief
in
pragmatism
itself
of
all
things
if
i
say
that
a
speech
is
eloquent
and
explain
as
meaning
the
power
to
work
in
certain
ways
upon
the
audience
or
if
i
say
a
book
is
original
and
define
to
mean
differing
from
other
books
russell
logic
if
i
follow
it
at
all
would
seem
to
doom
me
to
agreeing
that
the
speech
is
about
eloquence
and
the
book
about
other
books
when
i
call
a
belief
true
and
define
its
truth
to
mean
its
workings
i
certainly
do
not
mean
that
the
belief
is
a
belief
about
the
workings
it
is
a
belief
about
the
object
and
i
who
talk
about
the
workings
am
a
different
subject
with
a
different
universe
of
discourse
from
that
of
the
believer
of
whose
concrete
thinking
i
profess
to
give
an
account
the
social
proposition
men
exist
and
the
pragmatist
proposition
is
expedient
to
believe
that
other
men
exist
come
from
different
universes
of
discourse
one
can
believe
the
second
without
being
logically
compelled
to
believe
the
first
one
can
believe
the
first
without
having
ever
heard
of
the
second
or
one
can
believe
them
both
the
first
expresses
the
object
of
a
belief
the
second
tells
of
one
condition
of
the
belief
power
to
maintain
itself
there
is
no
identity
of
any
kind
save
the
term
men
which
they
contain
in
common
in
the
two
propositions
and
to
treat
them
as
mutually
substitutable
or
to
insist
that
we
shall
do
so
is
to
give
up
dealing
with
realities
altogether
ralph
hawtrey
who
seems
also
to
serve
under
the
banner
of
abstractionist
logic
convicts
us
pragmatists
of
absurdity
by
arguments
similar
to
russell
footnote
see
the
new
quarterly
for
march
as
a
favor
to
us
and
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
he
abandons
the
word
to
our
fury
allowing
it
to
mean
nothing
but
the
fact
that
certain
beliefs
are
expedient
and
he
uses
the
word
as
pratt
uses
the
word
to
designate
a
fact
not
about
the
belief
but
about
the
belief
object
namely
that
it
is
as
the
belief
declares
it
therefore
he
writes
say
it
is
correct
to
say
that
caesar
is
dead
i
mean
caesar
is
dead
this
must
be
regarded
as
the
definition
of
correctness
and
hawtrey
then
goes
on
to
demolish
me
by
the
conflict
of
the
definitions
what
is
for
the
pragmatist
can
not
be
what
is
he
says
the
definitions
are
not
logically
interchangeable
or
if
we
interchange
them
we
reach
the
tautology
caesar
is
dead
means
it
is
expedient
to
believe
that
caesar
is
dead
but
what
is
it
expedient
to
believe
why
that
caesar
is
dead
a
precious
definition
indeed
of
is
dead
hawtrey
conclusion
would
seem
to
be
that
the
pragmatic
definition
of
the
truth
of
a
belief
in
no
way
implies
what
that
the
believer
shall
believe
in
his
own
belief
deliverance
or
that
the
pragmatist
who
is
talking
about
him
shall
believe
in
that
deliverance
the
two
cases
are
quite
different
for
the
believer
caesar
must
of
course
really
exist
for
the
pragmatist
critic
he
need
not
for
the
pragmatic
deliverance
belongs
as
i
have
just
said
to
another
universe
of
discourse
altogether
when
one
argues
by
substituting
definition
for
definition
one
needs
to
stay
in
the
same
universe
the
great
shifting
of
universes
in
this
discussion
occurs
when
we
carry
the
word
from
the
subjective
into
the
objective
realm
applying
it
sometimes
to
a
property
of
opinions
sometimes
to
the
facts
which
the
opinions
assert
a
number
of
writers
as
russell
himself
moore
and
others
favor
the
unlucky
word
which
seems
expressly
invented
to
foster
this
confusion
for
they
speak
of
truth
as
a
property
of
but
in
naming
propositions
it
is
almost
impossible
not
to
use
the
word
that
caesar
is
dead
that
virtue
is
its
own
reward
are
propositions
i
do
not
say
that
for
certain
logical
purposes
it
may
not
be
useful
to
treat
propositions
as
absolute
entities
with
truth
or
falsehood
inside
of
them
respectively
or
to
make
of
a
complex
like
caesar
is
dead
a
single
term
and
call
it
a
but
the
here
has
the
extremely
convenient
ambiguity
for
those
who
wish
to
make
trouble
for
us
pragmatists
that
sometimes
it
means
the
fact
that
and
sometimes
the
belief
that
caesar
is
no
longer
living
when
i
then
call
the
belief
true
i
am
told
that
the
truth
means
the
fact
when
i
claim
the
fact
also
i
am
told
that
my
definition
has
excluded
the
fact
being
a
definition
only
of
a
certain
peculiarity
in
the
belief
so
that
in
the
end
i
have
no
truth
to
talk
about
left
in
my
possession
the
only
remedy
for
this
intolerable
ambiguity
is
it
seems
to
me
to
stick
to
terms
consistently
or
and
the
of
the
idea
or
belief
which
are
the
terms
i
have
consistently
held
to
seem
to
be
free
from
all
objection
whoever
takes
terms
abstracted
from
all
their
natural
settings
identifies
them
with
definitions
and
treats
the
latter
more
algebraico
not
only
risks
mixing
universes
but
risks
fallacies
which
the
man
in
the
street
easily
detects
to
prove
definition
that
the
statement
exists
is
identical
with
a
statement
about
because
the
one
statement
is
and
the
other
is
about
statements
is
like
proving
that
an
omnibus
is
a
boat
because
both
are
vehicles
a
horse
may
be
defined
as
a
beast
that
walks
on
the
nails
of
his
middle
digits
whenever
we
see
a
horse
we
see
such
a
beast
just
as
whenever
we
believe

we
believe
something
expedient
russell
and
hawtrey
if
they
followed
their
antipragmatist
logic
would
have
to
say
here
that
we
see
that
it
is
such
a
beast
a
fact
which
notoriously
no
one
sees
who
is
not
a
comparative
anatomist
it
almost
reconciles
one
to
being
no
logician
that
one
thereby
escapes
so
much
abstractionism
abstractionism
of
the
worst
sort
dogs
russell
in
his
own
trials
to
tell
positively
what
the
word
means
in
the
third
of
his
articles
on
meinong
in
mind
vol
xiii
he
attempts
this
feat
by
limiting
the
discussion
to
three
terms
only
a
proposition
its
content
and
an
object
abstracting
from
the
whole
context
of
associated
realities
in
which
such
terms
are
found
in
every
case
of
actual
knowing
he
puts
the
terms
thus
taken
in
a
vacuum
and
made
into
bare
logical
entities
through
every
possible
permutation
and
combination
tortures
them
on
the
rack
until
nothing
is
left
of
them
and
after
all
this
logical
gymnastic
comes
out
with
the
following
portentous
conclusion
as
what
he
believes
to
be
the
correct
view
that
there
is
no
problem
at
all
in
truth
and
falsehood
that
some
propositions
are
true
and
some
false
just
as
some
roses
are
red
and
some
white
that
belief
is
a
certain
attitude
towards
propositions
which
is
called
knowledge
when
they
are
true
error
when
they
are
false
and
he
seems
to
think
that
when
once
this
insight
is
reached
the
question
may
be
considered
closed
forever
in
spite
of
my
admiration
of
russell
analytic
powers
i
wish
after
reading
such
an
article
that
pragmatism
even
had
it
no
other
function
might
result
in
making
him
and
other
similarly
gifted
men
ashamed
of
having
used
such
powers
in
such
abstraction
from
reality
pragmatism
saves
us
at
any
rate
from
such
diseased
abstractionism
as
those
pages
show
since
the
foregoing
rejoinder
was
written
an
article
on
pragmatism
which
i
believe
to
be
by
russell
has
appeared
in
the
edinburgh
review
for
april
as
far
as
his
discussion
of
the
goes
altho
he
has
evidently
taken
great
pains
to
be
fair
it
seems
to
me
that
he
has
in
no
essential
respect
improved
upon
his
former
arguments
i
will
therefore
add
nothing
further
but
simply
refer
readers
who
may
be
curious
to
pp
of
the
said
article
xv
a
dialogue
after
correcting
the
proofs
of
all
that
precedes
i
imagine
a
residual
state
of
mind
on
the
part
of
my
reader
which
may
still
keep
him
unconvinced
and
which
it
may
be
my
duty
to
try
at
least
to
dispel
i
can
perhaps
be
briefer
if
i
put
what
i
have
to
say
in
dialogue
form
let
then
the
begin
you
say
that
the
truth
of
an
idea
is
constituted
by
its
workings
now
suppose
a
certain
state
of
facts
facts
for
example
of
antediluvian
planetary
history
concerning
which
the
question
may
be
asked
the
truth
about
them
ever
be
known
and
suppose
leaving
the
hypothesis
of
an
omniscient
absolute
out
of
the
account
that
we
assume
that
the
truth
is
never
to
be
known
i
ask
you
now
brother
pragmatist
whether
according
to
you
there
can
be
said
to
be
any
truth
at
all
about
such
a
state
of
facts
is
there
a
truth
or
is
there
not
a
truth
in
cases
where
at
any
rate
it
never
comes
to
be
known
pragmatist
why
do
you
ask
me
such
a
question
because
i
think
it
puts
you
in
a
bad
dilemma
prag
how
so
why
because
if
on
the
one
hand
you
elect
to
say
that
there
is
a
truth
you
thereby
surrender
your
whole
pragmatist
theory
according
to
that
theory
truth
requires
ideas
and
workings
to
constitute
it
but
in
the
present
instance
there
is
supposed
to
be
no
knower
and
consequently
neither
ideas
nor
workings
can
exist
what
then
remains
for
you
to
make
your
truth
of
prag
do
you
wish
like
so
many
of
my
enemies
to
force
me
to
make
the
truth
out
of
the
reality
itself
i
can
not
the
truth
is
something
known
thought
or
said
about
the
reality
and
consequently
numerically
additional
to
it
but
probably
your
intent
is
something
different
so
before
i
say
which
horn
of
your
dilemma
i
choose
i
ask
you
to
let
me
hear
what
the
other
horn
may
be
the
other
horn
is
this
that
if
you
elect
to
say
that
there
is
no
truth
under
the
conditions
assumed
because
there
are
no
ideas
or
workings
then
you
fly
in
the
face
of
common
sense
does
common
sense
believe
that
every
state
of
facts
must
in
the
nature
of
things
be
truly
statable
in
some
kind
of
a
proposition
even
tho
in
point
of
fact
the
proposition
should
never
be
propounded
by
a
living
soul
prag
unquestionably
common
sense
believes
this
and
so
do
i
there
have
been
innumerable
events
in
the
history
of
our
planet
of
which
nobody
ever
has
been
or
ever
will
be
able
to
give
an
account
yet
of
which
it
can
already
be
said
abstractly
that
only
one
sort
of
possible
account
can
ever
be
true
the
truth
about
any
such
event
is
thus
already
generically
predetermined
by
the
event
nature
and
one
may
accordingly
say
with
a
perfectly
good
conscience
that
it
virtually
common
sense
is
thus
right
in
its
instinctive
contention
is
this
then
the
horn
of
the
dilemma
which
you
stand
for
do
you
say
that
there
is
a
truth
even
in
cases
where
it
shall
never
be
known
prag
indeed
i
do
provided
you
let
me
hold
consistently
to
my
own
conception
of
truth
and
do
not
ask
me
to
abandon
it
for
something
which
i
find
impossible
to
you
also
believe
do
you
not
that
there
is
a
truth
even
in
cases
where
it
never
shall
be
known
i
do
indeed
believe
so
prag
pray
then
inform
me
in
what
according
to
you
this
truth
regarding
the
unknown
consists
consists
pray
what
do
you
mean
by
it
consists
in
nothing
but
itself
or
more
properly
speaking
it
has
neither
consistence
nor
existence
it
obtains
it
holds
prag
well
what
relation
does
it
bear
to
the
reality
of
which
it
holds
do
you
mean
relation
it
holds
of
it
of
course
it
knows
it
it
represents
it
prag
who
knows
it
what
represents
it
the
truth
does
the
truth
knows
it
or
rather
not
exactly
that
but
any
one
knows
it
who
possesses
the
truth
any
true
idea
of
the
reality
represents
the
truth
concerning
it
prag
but
i
thought
that
we
had
agreed
that
no
knower
of
it
nor
any
idea
representing
it
was
to
be
supposed
sure
enough
prag
then
i
beg
you
again
to
tell
me
in
what
this
truth
consists
all
by
itself
this
tertium
quid
intermediate
between
the
facts
per
se
on
the
one
hand
and
all
knowledge
of
them
actual
or
potential
on
the
other
what
is
the
shape
of
it
in
this
third
estate
of
what
stuff
mental
physical
or
is
it
built
what
metaphysical
region
of
reality
does
it
inhabit
what
absurd
questions
is
it
enough
to
say
that
it
is
true
that
the
facts
are
and
false
that
they
are
otherwise
prag
is
true
that
the
facts
are
i
wo
yield
to
the
temptation
of
asking
you
what
is
true
but
i
do
ask
you
whether
your
phrase
that
is
true
that
the
facts
are
really
means
anything
really
additional
to
the
bare
being
of
the
facts
themselves
it
seems
to
mean
more
than
the
bare
being
of
the
facts
it
is
a
sort
of
mental
equivalent
for
them
their
epistemological
function
their
value
in
noetic
terms
prag
a
sort
of
spiritual
double
or
ghost
of
them
apparently
if
so
may
i
ask
you
where
this
truth
is
found
where
where
there
is
no
it
simply
obtains
absolutely
obtains
prag
not
in
any
one
mind
no
for
we
agreed
that
no
actual
knower
of
the
truth
should
be
assumed
prag
no
actual
knower
i
agree
but
are
you
sure
that
no
notion
of
a
potential
or
ideal
knower
has
anything
to
do
with
forming
this
strangely
elusive
idea
of
the
truth
of
the
facts
in
your
mind
of
course
if
there
be
a
truth
concerning
the
facts
that
truth
is
what
the
ideal
knower
would
know
to
that
extent
you
ca
keep
the
notion
of
it
and
the
notion
of
him
separate
but
it
is
not
him
first
and
then
it
it
is
it
first
and
then
him
in
my
opinion
prag
but
you
still
leave
me
terribly
puzzled
as
to
the
status
of
this
truth
hanging
as
it
does
between
earth
and
heaven
between
reality
and
knowledge
grounded
in
the
reality
yet
numerically
additional
to
it
and
at
the
same
time
antecedent
to
any
opinion
and
entirely
independent
thereof
is
it
as
independent
of
the
knower
as
you
suppose
it
looks
to
me
terribly
dubious
as
if
it
might
be
only
another
name
for
a
potential
as
distinguished
from
an
actual
knowledge
of
the
reality
is
your
truth
after
all
simply
what
any
successful
knower
would
have
to
know
in
case
he
existed
and
in
a
universe
where
no
knowers
were
even
conceivable
would
any
truth
about
the
facts
there
as
something
numerically
distinguishable
from
the
facts
themselves
find
a
place
to
exist
in
to
me
such
truth
would
not
only
be
it
would
be
unimaginable
inconceivable
but
i
thought
you
said
a
while
ago
that
there
is
a
truth
of
past
events
even
tho
no
one
shall
ever
know
it
prag
yes
but
you
must
remember
that
i
also
stipulated
for
permission
to
define
the
word
in
my
own
fashion
the
truth
of
an
event
past
present
or
future
is
for
me
only
another
name
for
the
fact
that
if
the
event
ever
does
get
known
the
nature
of
the
knowledge
is
already
to
some
degree
predetermined
the
truth
which
precedes
actual
knowledge
of
a
fact
means
only
what
any
possible
knower
of
the
fact
will
eventually
find
himself
necessitated
to
believe
about
it
he
must
believe
something
that
will
bring
him
into
satisfactory
relations
with
it
that
will
prove
a
decent
mental
substitute
for
it
what
this
something
may
be
is
of
course
partly
fixed
already
by
the
nature
of
the
fact
and
by
the
sphere
of
its
associations
this
seems
to
me
all
that
you
can
clearly
mean
when
you
say
that
truth
to
knowledge
it
is
knowledge
anticipated
knowledge
in
the
form
of
possibility
merely
but
what
does
the
knowledge
know
when
it
comes
does
it
know
the
truth
and
if
so
must
the
truth
be
distinct
from
either
the
fact
or
the
knowledge
prag
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
knowledge
knows
is
the
fact
itself
the
event
or
whatever
the
reality
may
be
where
you
see
three
distinct
entities
in
the
field
the
reality
the
knowing
and
the
truth
i
see
only
two
moreover
i
can
see
what
each
of
my
two
entities
is
but
when
i
ask
myself
what
your
third
entity
the
truth
is
i
can
find
nothing
distinct
from
the
reality
on
the
one
hand
and
the
ways
in
which
it
may
be
known
on
the
other
are
you
not
probably
misled
by
common
language
which
has
found
it
convenient
to
introduce
a
hybrid
name
meaning
sometimes
a
kind
of
knowing
and
sometimes
a
reality
known
to
apply
to
either
of
these
things
interchangeably
and
has
philosophy
anything
to
gain
by
perpetuating
and
consecrating
the
ambiguity
if
you
call
the
object
of
knowledge
and
call
the
manner
of
its
being
cognized
cognized
moreover
on
particular
occasions
and
variously
by
particular
human
beings
who
have
their
various
businesses
with
it
and
if
you
hold
consistently
to
this
nomenclature
it
seems
to
me
that
you
escape
all
sorts
of
trouble
do
you
mean
that
you
think
you
escape
from
my
dilemma
prag
assuredly
i
escape
for
if
truth
and
knowledge
are
terms
correlative
and
interdependent
as
i
maintain
they
are
then
wherever
knowledge
is
conceivable
truth
is
conceivable
wherever
knowledge
is
possible
truth
is
possible
wherever
knowledge
is
actual
truth
is
actual
therefore
when
you
point
your
first
horn
at
me
i
think
of
truth
actual
and
say
it
does
exist
it
does
for
by
hypothesis
there
is
no
knower
no
ideas
no
workings
i
agree
however
that
truth
possible
or
virtual
might
exist
for
a
knower
might
possibly
be
brought
to
birth
and
truth
conceivable
certainly
exists
for
abstractly
taken
there
is
nothing
in
the
nature
of
antediluvian
events
that
should
make
the
application
of
knowledge
to
them
inconceivable
therefore
when
you
try
to
impale
me
on
your
second
horn
i
think
of
the
truth
in
question
as
a
mere
abstract
possibility
so
i
say
it
does
exist
and
side
with
common
sense
do
not
these
distinctions
rightly
relieve
me
from
embarrassment
and
do
you
think
it
might
help
you
to
make
them
yourself
never
so
avaunt
with
your
abominable
and
sophistry
truth
is
truth
and
never
will
i
degrade
it
by
identifying
it
with
low
pragmatic
particulars
in
the
way
you
propose
prag
well
my
dear
antagonist
i
hardly
hoped
to
convert
an
eminent
intellectualist
and
logician
like
you
so
enjoy
as
long
as
you
live
your
own
ineffable
conception
perhaps
the
rising
generation
will
grow
up
more
accustomed
than
you
are
to
that
concrete
and
empirical
interpretation
of
terms
in
which
the
pragmatic
method
consists
perhaps
they
may
then
wonder
how
so
harmless
and
natural
an
account
of
truth
as
mine
could
have
found
such
difficulty
in
entering
the
minds
of
men
far
more
intelligent
than
i
can
ever
hope
to
become
but
wedded
by
education
and
tradition
to
the
abstractionist
manner
of
thought
