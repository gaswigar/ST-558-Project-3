the
career
of
katherine
bush
chapter
i
dusk
was
coming
on
when
katherine
bush
left
the
office
of
the
jew
money
lenders
livingstone
and
devereux
in
holles
street
theirs
was
a
modest
establishment
with
no
indication
upon
the
wire
blind
of
the
only
street
window
as
to
the
trade
practised
by
the
two
owners
of
the
aristocratic
names
emblazoned
upon
the
dingy
transparency
but
it
was
very
well
known
all
the
same
to
numerous
young
bloods
who
often
sought
temporary
relief
within
its
doors
katherine
bush
had
been
the
shorthand
typist
there
since
she
was
nineteen
they
paid
her
well
and
she
had
the
whole
of
saturday
to
herself
she
sat
clicking
at
her
machine
most
of
the
day
behind
a
glass
screen
and
when
she
lifted
her
head
she
could
see
those
who
came
to
the
desk
beyond
she
could
hear
their
voices
and
if
she
listened
very
carefully
she
could
distinguish
the
words
they
said
in
the
three
years
in
which
she
had
earned
thirty
shillings
a
week
sitting
there
she
had
become
quite
a
connoisseur
in
male
voices
and
had
made
numerous
deductions
therefrom
liv
and
dev
as
percival
livingstone
and
benjamin
devereux
were
called
with
undue
familiarity
by
their
subordinates
often
wondered
how
katherine
bush
seemed
to
know
exactly
the
suitable
sort
of
letter
to
write
to
each
client
without
being
told
she
was
certainly
a
most
valuable
young
woman
and
worth
the
rise
the
firm
meant
to
offer
her
shortly
she
hardly
ever
spoke
and
when
she
did
raise
her
sullen
eyes
with
a
question
in
them
you
were
wiser
to
answer
it
without
too
much
palaver
the
eyes
were
darkly
heavily
lashed
and
were
compelling
and
disconcertingly
steady
and
set
like
greek
eyes
under
broad
brows
her
cheeks
were
flat
and
her
nose
straight
and
her
mouth
was
full
and
large
and
red
for
the
rest
she
was
a
colourless
creature
with
a
mop
of
hair
which
gleamed
with
silvery
lights
she
was
tall
and
slight
and
she
could
at
any
moment
have
been
turned
by
a
clever
dressmaker
and
hairdresser
into
a
great
beauty
but
as
it
was
she
gave
no
thought
to
her
appearance
and
looked
unremarkable
and
ordinary
and
lower
she
had
wonderful
hands
where
they
came
from
the
good
god
alone
knew
with
their
whiteness
and
their
shape
they
were
strong
too
and
perhaps
appeared
boyish
rather
than
feminine
she
did
not
inherit
them
from
that
excellent
mother
retired
to
a
better
world
some
ten
years
before
nor
from
that
astute
auctioneer
father
who
dying
suddenly
had
left
that
comfortable
villa
at
bindon
green
brixton
as
a
permanent
home
for
his
large
family
but
from
whence
come
souls
and
bodies
and
hands
and
eyes
and
whither
do
they
go
katherine
bush
often
asked
herself
questions
like
these
and
plodded
on
until
she
could
give
herself
some
kind
of
answer
not
one
single
moment
of
her
conscious
hours
had
ever
been
wasted
she
was
always
learning
something
and
before
she
had
reached
sixteen
she
had
realised
that
power
to
rule
will
eventually
be
in
the
grasp
of
the
man
or
woman
who
can
reap
the
benefit
of
lessons
she
had
enjoyed
her
work
at
the
night
schools
and
the
wet
sundays
curled
up
with
a
book
in
the
armchair
in
the
tiny
attic
which
she
preferred
to
a
larger
bedroom
because
she
could
have
it
alone
unshared
with
a
sister
her
mind
had
become
a
storehouse
of
miscellaneous
english
literature
a
good
deal
mispronounced
in
the
words
because
she
had
never
heard
it
read
aloud
by
a
cultivated
voice
she
knew
french
grammatically
but
her
accent
would
have
made
a
delicate
ear
wince
her
own
voice
was
singularly
refined
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
she
had
diligently
listened
to
the
voices
of
impecunious
aristocrats
for
over
three
years
for
the
moment
katherine
bush
was
in
love
lord
algy
had
happened
to
glance
over
the
glass
screen
upon
his
first
visit
to
liv
and
dev
to
be
accommodated
with
a
thousand
pounds
and
his
attractive
blue
eyes
had
met
the
ones
he
had
spoken
to
her
when
she
came
out
to
luncheon
but
he
had
done
it
really
intelligently
and
katherine
was
not
insulted
indeed
accustomed
as
she
was
to
weigh
everything
in
life
she
accorded
him
a
mead
of
praise
for
the
manner
in
which
he
had
carried
out
his
intention
to
make
her
acquaintance
she
had
flouted
him
and
turned
him
more
or
less
inside
out
for
over
a
month
but
she
had
let
him
give
her
lunch
and
now
she
had
decided
to
spend
the
saturday
to
monday
with
him
for
the
scheme
of
existence
which
she
had
planned
out
for
herself
she
decided
her
experience
must
be
more
complete
one
must
see
life
she
argued
and
it
was
better
to
make
a
first
plunge
with
a
person
of
refinement
who
knew
the
whole
game
than
with
one
of
her
own
class
who
would
be
but
a
very
sorry
instructor
heavens
to
spend
a
saturday
to
monday
with
the
counterpart
of
her
brothers
fred
and
bert
the
idea
made
her
shudder
she
disliked
them
and
their
friends
enough
as
it
was
and
the
idea
of
marriage
in
that
circle
never
entered
her
level
head
of
what
use
would
be
all
her
studies
and
the
lessons
she
had
mastered
if
she
buried
herself
forever
at
brixton
with
charlie
prodgers
or
at
clapham
with
percy
watson
at
this
stage
no
moral
questions
troubled
her
at
all
nor
had
she
begun
really
to
apply
the
laws
of
cause
and
effect
in
their
full
measure
although
she
was
quite
aware
that
what
she
proposed
to
do
was
the
last
thing
she
would
have
considered
wise
or
safe
for
another
woman
to
attempt
rules
of
conduct
were
wisely
made
for
communities
she
felt
and
must
be
kept
or
disaster
must
inevitably
follow
but
in
her
own
case
she
was
willing
to
take
risks
thoroughly
believing
in
her
own
cool
discrimination
the
outlook
for
her
should
always
be
vast
lord
algy
was
passionately
devoted
and
it
was
wiser
early
in
life
to
know
the
nature
of
men
thus
she
argued
to
herself
being
totally
unaware
that
her
point
of
view
was
altogether
affected
because
her
heart
and
her
senses
pleaded
hard
being
touched
for
the
first
time
in
her
years
she
was
quite
untroubled
by
what
the
world
calls
morality
and
she
had
no
scruples
these
were
for
a
later
date
in
her
career
the
path
looked
clear
and
full
of
roses
she
had
not
been
in
the
habit
of
consulting
her
family
as
to
her
movements
and
had
many
times
gone
by
herself
for
holidays
to
the
seaside
no
questions
would
be
asked
her
when
she
returned
on
the
monday
if
the
matter
could
have
created
scandal
she
would
not
have
gone
to
create
scandal
was
not
at
all
part
of
her
game
lord
algy
had
arranged
to
take
her
to
paris
by
that
friday
train
they
would
have
all
saturday
and
sunday
and
then
return
on
monday
night
liv
and
dev
had
granted
her
a
holiday
until
the
tuesday
she
had
put
on
her
best
blue
serge
suit
that
morning
and
had
taken
a
small
valise
with
what
she
considered
necessary
things
and
now
her
heart
beat
rather
fast
as
she
turned
into
oxford
street
in
the
gathering
october
dusk
for
a
few
moments
she
wondered
what
it
would
have
been
like
if
she
had
been
going
to
marry
lord
algy
before
all
the
world
quite
a
great
pleasure
no
doubt
for
a
month
or
two
but
then
he
was
the
fourth
son
of
a
stingy
welsh
marquis
and
nothing
would
ever
induce
his
family
to
pardon
such
a
m√©salliance
of
this
she
was
well
aware
it
was
the
business
of
liv
and
dev
to
make
themselves
acquainted
with
a
good
deal
about
the
peerage
and
whatever
her
employers
knew
katherine
bush
knew
life
for
her
held
no
illusions
her
studies
had
convinced
her
that
to
be
strong
and
perfectly
honest
were
the
only
two
things
of
any
avail
and
to
acquire
a
thorough
knowledge
of
human
beings
so
as
then
to
be
able
to
manipulate
these
pawns
lord
algy
she
believed
was
only
a
most
agreeable
part
of
her
education
but
of
no
vital
importance
she
would
have
been
horrified
if
anyone
had
told
her
that
she
was
mixing
up
sentiment
in
the
affair
to
get
everything
down
to
its
bedrock
meaning
had
been
her
endeavour
ever
since
she
had
first
read
darwin
and
herbert
spencer
i
shall
have
the
experience
of
a
widow
she
said
to
herself
and
can
then
decide
what
is
next
to
be
done
lord
algy
was
a
guardsman
and
knew
among
other
things
exactly
how
to
spend
an
agreeable
saturday
to
monday
he
was
piqued
by
katherine
bush
and
almost
in
love
he
looked
forward
to
his
brief
honeymoon
with
delight
he
was
waiting
for
her
in
a
taxicab
at
the
corner
of
oxford
circus
and
when
she
got
in
with
her
little
valise
he
caught
and
kissed
her
hand
we
will
go
and
dine
at
the
great
terminus
he
told
her
in
his
charming
voice
and
do
you
think
it
would
be
much
nicer
if
we
stayed
there
and
went
on
by
the
morning
train
it
is
such
a
miserable
hour
to
arrive
in
paris
otherwise
you
would
be
knocked
up
for
the
day
he
was
holding
her
hand
and
the
nearness
of
him
thrilled
her
in
some
new
and
delicious
way
she
hesitated
though
for
a
moment
she
never
acted
on
impulse
she
crushed
down
a
strange
sensation
of
gasp
which
came
in
her
throat
after
all
of
what
matter
if
she
stayed
or
started
since
she
had
already
cast
the
die
and
did
not
mean
to
shirk
the
payment
of
the
stakes
very
well
she
said
quite
low
i
hoped
you
would
agree
pet
he
whispered
encircling
her
with
his
arm
i
meant
to
persuade
you
and
i
am
going
to
make
you
so
awfully
happy
i
sent
my
servant
this
afternoon
to
take
the
rooms
for
us
and
everything
will
be
ready
this
sounded
agreeable
enough
and
katherine
bush
permitted
herself
to
smile
which
was
a
rare
occurrence
she
would
spend
hours
and
days
without
the
flicker
of
one
coming
near
her
red
lips
in
the
uncertain
light
lord
algy
felt
it
more
than
he
actually
saw
it
and
it
warmed
him
she
was
as
he
had
confessed
to
his
best
friend
in
the
battalion
an
enigma
to
him
hence
her
charm
she
treats
me
as
though
i
were
the
ground
under
her
feet
at
times
he
recounted
to
jack
kilcourcy
i
do
think
she
cares
two
damned
straws
for
me
really
but
by
jove
she
is
worth
while
she
has
no
nonsense
about
her
and
she
is
so
awfully
game
he
had
taken
good
care
never
to
let
jack
see
her
though
or
tell
him
her
name
it
was
not
long
before
they
reached
the
hotel
and
katherine
bush
was
a
little
angry
with
herself
because
she
felt
a
quiver
of
nervousness
when
they
were
in
the
big
hall
lord
algy
knew
all
the
ropes
and
his
air
of
complete
insouciance
reassured
her
a
discreet
valet
stepped
forward
and
spoke
to
his
master
and
they
were
soon
in
the
lift
and
so
to
a
and
warmed
suite
these
colours
and
this
imitation
chippendale
are
rather
awful
they
lord
algy
said
looking
round
but
we
must
not
mind
as
it
is
only
for
one
night
the
palatial
in
paris
will
be
different
i
am
glad
hanson
saw
to
the
flowers
huge
bunches
of
roses
stood
upon
the
table
and
mantelpiece
katherine
bush
thought
it
a
splendid
place
but
if
it
appeared
rather
awful
to
him
she
must
not
show
her
admiration
tea
will
come
in
a
moment
i
mean
chocolate
pet
and
i
think
we
shall
be
as
jolly
as
can
be
in
there
is
your
room
they
will
have
brought
up
your
valise
by
now
i
expect
katherine
bush
moved
forward
and
went
through
the
door
a
cheery
fire
was
burning
and
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
on
a
chair
there
was
a
big
cardboard
box
she
looked
at
it
it
was
addressed
mrs
rufus
who
is
that
and
what
is
it
for
she
asked
in
a
voice
deep
as
a
well
it
is
just
a
coat
darling
lord
algy
answered
as
he
pulled
undone
the
string
and
a
little
wrap
i
thought
you
would
be
so
awfully
cold
on
the
boat
and
probably
would
not
have
been
able
to
bring
much
luggage
a
slight
flush
came
into
the
young
woman
white
cheeks
something
in
her
loathed
taking
presents
thanks
awfully
i
be
glad
to
have
you
lend
them
to
me
for
this
trip
but
why
is
it
addressed
rufus
mr
devereux
has
got
a
sister
of
that
name
lord
algy
laughed
well
you
see
i
could
not
have
it
because
every
one
knows
that
is
the
merioneth
name
given
us
poor
devils
by
the
normans
because
we
were
such
a
lot
and
i
bet
they
found
our
own
too
difficult
to
pronounce
he
began
pulling
out
the
coat
and
a
soft
pink
silk
from
the
box
i
always
am
just
when
i
come
out
like
this
he
laughed
again
a
little
constrainedly
it
had
just
struck
him
that
the
latter
part
of
his
sentence
was
perhaps
not
very
felicitously
expressed
since
he
knew
katherine
bush
was
no
chorus
lady
accustomed
to
temporary
wedded
appellations
she
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
with
her
strange
disconcertingly
steady
ones
and
then
she
smiled
again
as
the
sphinx
might
have
done
before
being
set
in
eternal
immobility
of
stone
lord
algy
felt
stupidly
uncomfortable
so
he
folded
her
in
his
arms
with
a
fond
caress
a
far
better
plan
he
had
always
found
than
any
argument
or
explanation
with
women
katherine
bush
realised
the
joy
of
it
she
was
ready
for
every
grade
of
pleasure
as
well
as
experience
this
was
how
things
were
done
in
lord
algy
world
then
so
be
it
together
they
looked
at
the
coat
and
wrap
and
he
helped
her
to
take
off
her
hat
and
jacket
and
try
them
on
they
were
very
friendly
and
lord
algy
suggested
that
as
the
was
almost
a
teagown
and
was
fairly
pretty
she
might
wear
it
for
dinner
which
they
would
have
in
the
you
look
sweet
in
pink
darling
he
lisped
as
he
kissed
her
ear
and
it
will
be
so
soft
and
cosy
then
the
waiter
knocked
at
the
door
and
said
the
chocolate
was
ready
so
they
went
back
to
the
sitting
room
he
was
quite
adorable
as
he
assisted
her
to
pour
in
the
cream
but
katherine
bush
now
decided
she
would
keep
him
at
arm
length
for
a
while
the
game
was
really
so
entertaining
and
its
moves
must
be
made
to
last
as
long
as
possible
lord
algy
enjoyed
fencing
too
so
they
talked
in
a
more
way
for
an
hour
or
more
and
then
she
told
him
she
would
go
and
change
for
dinner
as
it
would
be
ready
in
twenty
minutes
i
have
to
be
your
maid
darling
i
make
an
awfully
good
maid
i
never
bungle
with
the
beastly
hooks
and
i
should
love
to
brush
your
hair
his
eyes
shone
with
passion
and
his
face
was
close
to
her
own
you
shall
perhaps
katherine
bush
retorted
and
slipping
into
the
room
beyond
she
shut
the
door
lord
algy
flung
himself
into
an
armchair
lit
a
cigarette
and
laughed
softly
he
had
never
had
such
an
experience
as
this
she
is
a
wonder
he
said
to
himself
astonishing
for
her
class
for
any
class
she
reminds
me
of
some
french
heroine
what
her
name
fellow
wrote
jolly
nice
stuff
oh
er
de
of
course
by
jove
i
believe
i
am
going
to
have
a
time
like
that
chap
had
only
she
wo
go
off
into
limbo
on
monday
night
confound
it
i
believe
i
in
love
then
he
threw
away
his
cigarette
end
and
went
round
through
the
outer
passage
to
his
room
beyond
hers
where
he
found
his
servant
turning
on
his
bath
in
the
bathroom
which
divided
their
apartments
madame
did
not
seem
to
require
it
yet
hanson
said
respectfully
so
i
have
turned
on
your
lordship
first
and
in
a
few
minutes
lord
algy
was
splashing
in
the
lubin
scented
water
while
he
gaily
whistled
a
tune
and
katherine
bush
heard
him
as
she
was
sponging
her
white
face
and
stopped
and
listened
surprisedly
whatever
can
he
be
having
a
bath
for
at
this
time
of
day
she
said
to
herself
and
it
is
not
saturday
then
the
thought
came
it
might
be
the
custom
of
his
class
to
bathe
before
dinner
a
scarlet
spot
grew
in
each
cheek
she
must
never
forget
to
learn
and
profit
by
her
lessons
so
she
deliberately
went
and
knocked
on
the
communicating
door
and
called
out
algy
you
are
mean
to
take
the
first
when
you
have
finished
turn
on
mine
and
then
she
stood
and
trembled
for
a
minute
while
she
piled
up
her
great
mass
of
ashen
hair
all
right
darling
he
called
back
only
i
must
have
my
reward
when
please
the
young
woman
said
to
herself
and
not
until
at
dinner
she
looked
quite
pretty
the
pink
suited
her
pale
skin
and
the
unusual
feminine
fluffiness
of
the
garment
altered
her
rather
stern
appearance
she
had
not
yet
begun
to
employ
any
art
whatever
or
to
alter
the
rough
bundling
up
of
her
hair
but
now
out
to
enjoy
herself
under
the
most
propitious
and
circumstances
her
strange
sullen
eyes
shone
with
a
subtle
fascination
and
her
deep
voice
had
tones
in
it
which
seduced
the
ear
she
had
never
dined
with
him
before
only
lunched
and
now
it
behooved
her
to
observe
the
ways
of
things
as
she
was
quite
ignorant
of
the
art
of
dining
out
benjamin
devereux
had
made
advances
to
her
in
her
first
year
at
liv
and
dev
but
she
had
annihilated
him
and
withered
his
proposals
for
unlimited
dinners
and
a
generous
settlement
with
scorn
there
had
never
been
a
moment
when
she
had
contemplated
her
charms
being
wasted
upon
anything
but
an
aristocrat
from
whom
she
could
acquire
tone
no
denizen
of
bindon
green
no
friend
of
the
family
no
companion
in
the
morning
train
had
ever
had
so
much
as
a
kind
word
much
less
the
tip
of
one
of
her
strong
white
fingers
she
was
as
a
bunch
of
grapes
with
perfect
bloom
retained
she
was
taking
in
every
line
of
lord
algy
as
she
sat
there
sipping
her
soup
she
had
refused
oysters
and
had
watched
him
as
he
devoured
his
with
the
joy
of
an
epicure
she
had
not
been
quite
certain
as
to
which
was
the
right
implement
to
employ
she
supposed
it
was
that
little
fork
with
the
three
prongs
but
she
determined
to
make
no
mistakes
it
was
easy
enough
to
gobble
oysters
soused
in
vinegar
and
red
pepper
with
huge
slices
of
bread
and
butter
and
a
bottle
of
stout
as
her
brother
fred
was
wont
to
enjoy
them
at
supper
on
saturday
nights
or
they
could
be
pulled
about
in
the
mincing
fashion
in
which
his
fianc√©e
that
genteel
mabel
cawber
treated
them
with
little
finger
daintily
curved
and
the
first
and
the
thumb
only
in
use
but
before
she
katherine
bush
swallowed
one
she
would
ascertain
exactly
how
they
were
eaten
in
lord
algy
world
no
good
out
of
this
trip
should
be
wasted
as
dinner
advanced
he
began
to
make
more
ardent
love
to
her
and
the
champagne
elevated
both
their
spirits
he
reproached
her
for
her
hardness
in
not
having
allowed
him
to
play
the
part
of
maid
after
all
she
was
a
capricious
little
darling
but
surely
did
not
mean
to
go
on
being
unkind
no
she
did
not
but
she
had
suddenly
realised
while
dressing
that
some
of
her
garments
were
not
fine
enough
for
the
situation
and
must
be
kept
out
of
sight
she
did
not
tell
him
this
however
but
continued
to
enact
the
r√¥le
of
condescending
queen
while
quietly
she
watched
him
as
a
cat
watches
a
mouse
she
loved
the
way
his
hair
was
brushed
how
different
from
charlie
prodgers
she
loved
the
finely
cut
back
of
his
head
she
was
perfectly
aware
that
he
showed
outwardly
every
mark
of
breeding
in
his
weak
handsome
face
and
lean
figure
these
things
pleased
her
especially
the
breeding
it
was
so
very
far
from
what
she
ever
saw
at
bindon
green
lord
algy
had
the
easy
pleasant
manner
of
his
kind
with
a
strong
personal
attraction
amply
balancing
absence
of
brain
for
general
purposes
and
he
was
versed
in
every
art
for
the
cajoling
of
women
the
dinner
grew
more
and
more
agreeable
until
when
coffee
and
liqueurs
came
katherine
bush
felt
exalted
into
a
strange
heaven
she
had
analysed
almost
all
emotions
in
the
abstract
but
not
their
possible
effects
upon
herself
she
found
the
ones
she
was
experiencing
now
peculiarly
delightful
to
be
and
in
love
for
the
first
time
in
life
with
an
extremely
delectable
specimen
of
manhood
to
be
free
as
air
answerable
to
no
one
untroubled
by
backward
or
forward
thoughts
unworried
by
tormenting
speculations
as
to
whether
the
affair
was
right
or
wrong
wise
or
unwise
this
was
a
state
of
things
which
made
the
cup
worth
drinking
and
katherine
bush
knew
it
no
possibility
of
bitter
dregs
to
follow
the
last
sip
entered
her
calculations
the
imp
gods
laughed
no
doubt
and
lord
algy
blue
eyes
were
full
of
passionate
delight
thus
with
all
things
de
katherine
bush
began
her
brief
honeymoon
chapter
ii
and
i
shall
not
see
you
for
a
whole
month
my
precious
pet
lord
algy
whispered
as
the
train
was
approaching
charing
cross
at
about
eleven
on
the
monday
night
of
the
return
journey
i
do
know
how
i
shall
bear
it
but
you
will
write
every
day
wo
you
promise
me
darling
i
wish
now
that
i
had
not
taken
first
leave
and
arranged
to
shoot
with
my
next
week
his
arm
still
encircled
her
and
her
head
leaned
against
his
shoulder
so
that
he
could
not
see
the
expression
in
her
sombre
eyes
it
was
that
of
an
animal
in
pain
no
i
shall
not
write
algy
and
you
must
not
either
we
have
had
a
divine
time
and
i
shall
never
forget
it
but
it
is
stupid
to
write
what
good
would
it
be
to
either
of
us
he
pleaded
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
live
without
a
word
after
the
three
days
of
perfect
bliss
they
had
enjoyed
and
of
course
they
would
enjoy
many
more
when
he
returned
from
wales
katherine
bush
did
not
argue
with
him
of
what
use
since
her
own
mind
was
entirely
made
up
she
just
let
him
kiss
her
as
much
as
he
desired
without
speaking
a
word
and
then
she
arranged
her
hat
and
veil
and
was
demurely
ready
to
get
out
when
the
train
should
draw
up
at
the
platform
lord
algy
could
not
have
been
more
loverlike
he
was
really
feeling
full
of
emotion
and
awfully
sorry
to
part
she
had
been
so
wonderful
he
told
himself
she
had
enjoyed
the
whole
thing
so
simply
and
was
such
a
delightful
companion
she
had
not
asked
any
silly
questions
or
plagued
him
with
sentimental
kinds
of
suggestions
as
lots
of
girls
might
have
done
with
her
limited
experience
of
these
transitory
affairs
she
had
accepted
the
situation
as
frankly
as
a
savage
who
had
never
heard
that
there
could
be
any
more
binding
unions
he
really
did
not
know
how
he
was
going
to
stand
a
whole
month
of
separation
but
perhaps
it
was
just
as
well
as
he
was
on
the
verge
of
being
ridiculously
in
love
and
to
plunge
in
he
knew
would
be
a
hopeless
mistake
she
was
a
thousand
times
nicer
and
more
interesting
than
any
girl
he
had
ever
met
in
his
life
if
she
had
only
been
a
lady
and
there
would
not
be
any
row
about
it
he
could
imagine
any
fellow
being
glad
to
marry
her
she
was
not
at
all
cold
either
indeed
far
from
it
and
seemed
instinctively
to
understand
the
most
enchanting
passion
he
thought
of
de
again
and
felt
he
had
been
as
equally
blessed
as
she
would
make
the
sweetest
friend
for
months
and
months
and
he
would
rush
back
from
wales
the
moment
he
could
break
from
his
family
and
seek
solace
in
her
arms
he
would
have
got
himself
in
hand
again
by
then
so
as
not
to
do
anything
stupid
he
always
meant
to
be
very
very
good
to
her
though
thus
he
dreamed
and
grew
more
demonstrative
clasping
her
once
again
in
a
fond
farewell
embrace
during
the
last
available
moment
and
his
charming
blue
eyes
with
their
brown
curly
lashes
looked
half
full
of
tears
say
you
love
me
darling
he
commanded
wishing
like
all
lovers
to
hear
the
spoken
words
katherine
bush
was
very
pale
and
there
was
concentrated
feeling
in
her
face
which
startled
him
then
she
answered
her
voice
deeper
than
usual
yes
i
love
you
algy
perhaps
you
will
never
know
how
much
i
do
not
suppose
i
will
ever
really
love
anyone
else
in
the
same
way
in
my
life
then
the
train
drew
up
at
the
station
the
people
all
looked
unreal
in
the
foggy
october
air
under
the
glaring
lights
and
the
whole
thing
appeared
as
a
dream
indeed
when
half
an
hour
later
katherine
sped
through
the
suburban
roads
to
bindon
green
alone
in
the
taxi
lord
algy
had
put
her
in
and
paid
the
man
liberally
and
with
many
last
love
words
had
bidden
her
and
so
this
chapter
was
finished
she
realised
that
and
it
had
been
really
worth
while
an
outlook
had
opened
for
her
into
a
whole
new
world
where
realities
lived
where
new
beings
moved
where
new
standpoints
could
be
reached
she
saw
that
her
former
life
had
been
swept
from
her
and
now
to
look
back
upon
appeared
an
impossible
tedium
she
had
mastered
all
the
shades
of
what
three
days
of
most
intimate
companionship
with
could
mean
and
the
memory
contained
no
flaw
algy
chivalry
and
courtesy
had
never
faltered
she
might
have
been
a
princess
or
his
bride
from
the
homage
he
had
paid
her
dear
algy
her
passion
for
him
was
tinged
with
almost
a
mother
love
there
was
something
so
tender
and
about
him
but
now
she
must
take
stern
hold
of
herself
and
must
have
pluck
enough
to
profit
by
what
she
had
learned
of
life
though
she
was
too
tired
to
do
more
than
retrospect
oh
the
wonder
of
it
all
the
wonder
of
love
and
the
wonder
of
emotion
she
clenched
her
cold
hands
round
the
handle
of
her
little
valise
she
was
trembling
she
had
insisted
upon
his
keeping
the
coat
for
the
present
how
could
she
account
for
it
to
her
family
she
had
argued
but
she
never
meant
to
take
it
again
no
one
was
awake
at
laburnum
villa
when
she
opened
the
door
with
her
latchkey
and
she
crept
up
to
her
little
icy
chamber
under
the
roof
numb
in
mind
and
body
and
soul
and
was
soon
shivering
between
the
cotton
sheets
oh
the
contrast
to
the
warm
bedroom
at
the
palatial
and
once
she
had
not
known
the
difference
between
linen
and
cotton
she
said
this
over
to
herself
while
she
felt
the
nap
and
then
the
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
one
by
one
and
she
sobbed
uncontrollably
for
a
while
alas
to
have
to
renounce
all
joy
forever
more
she
fell
asleep
towards
morning
and
woke
with
a
start
as
her
alarm
clock
thundered
but
her
face
was
set
like
marble
and
there
was
not
a
trace
of
weakness
upon
it
when
she
appeared
at
the
family
scramble
which
did
duty
for
breakfast
there
had
been
a
row
between
fred
and
gladys
the
sister
a
year
older
than
herself
who
was
a
saleswoman
at
a
fashionable
establishment
matilda
the
eldest
of
the
family
was
trying
to
smooth
matters
while
she
sewed
up
a
rent
in
the
skirt
which
ethel
the
youngest
would
presently
wear
to
the
school
for
young
ladies
which
she
daily
attended
this
the
most
youthful
miss
bush
meanwhile
sat
in
a
very
soiled
japanese
quilted
dressing
gown
devouring
sausages
there
were
bloaters
on
the
table
too
and
treacle
and
the
little
general
servant
was
just
bringing
in
the
unsavory
coffee
in
the
tin
coffeepot
tea
had
been
good
enough
for
them
always
in
the
father
time
and
matilda
for
her
part
could
not
see
why
fred
had
insisted
upon
having
coffee
on
the
strength
of
a
trip
to
boulogne
on
bank
holiday
but
there
it
was
when
fred
insisted
things
had
to
be
done
even
if
one
hated
coffee
katherine
bush
loathed
most
of
her
family
she
had
not
an
expansive
nature
and
was
quite
ruthless
why
should
she
love
them
just
because
they
were
her
brothers
and
sisters
she
had
not
asked
to
be
born
among
them
they
were
completely
uncongenial
to
her
and
always
had
been
it
was
obviously
ridiculous
and
illogical
then
to
expect
her
to
feel
affection
for
them
just
because
of
this
accident
of
birth
so
she
argued
matilda
the
eldest
who
had
always
been
a
mother
to
the
rest
did
hold
one
small
corner
of
her
heart
poor
old
tild
as
she
called
her
the
greatest
old
fool
living
and
matilda
adored
her
difficult
sister
how
doubly
impossible
they
all
appeared
now
to
the
unveiled
eyes
of
katherine
this
is
simply
disgusting
stuff
this
coffee
she
said
putting
her
cup
down
with
a
grimace
it
is
no
more
like
french
coffee
than
ett
looks
like
a
japanese
because
she
has
got
on
that
dirty
what
do
you
know
of
french
coffee
i
like
to
ask
what
ho
bert
the
brother
just
younger
than
herself
demanded
with
one
of
his
bright
flashes
have
you
been
to
for
a
bit
of
a
song
like
the
i
wish
you
give
over
calling
me
the
bert
frederick
bush
interposed
stopping
for
a
moment
his
bicker
with
gladys
mabel
strongly
objects
to
it
she
says
it
is
elderly
and
she
dislikes
slang
anyway
but
albert
bush
waved
half
a
sausage
on
his
fork
and
subsided
into
a
chuckle
of
laughter
he
was
the
recognised
wit
of
the
family
and
ethel
giggled
in
chorus
katherine
never
replied
to
any
of
their
remarks
unless
she
wished
to
there
was
no
use
in
throwing
down
the
gauntlet
to
her
it
remained
lying
there
she
did
not
even
answer
matilda
tentative
suggestion
that
she
had
always
drunk
the
coffee
before
without
abusing
it
if
they
only
knew
how
significant
the
word
before
sounded
to
her
that
morning
she
finished
her
bit
of
burnt
toast
and
began
putting
on
her
hat
at
a
side
mirror
preparatory
to
starting
she
did
not
tell
gladys
that
she
would
be
late
if
she
did
not
leave
also
that
was
her
sister
own
affair
she
never
interfered
with
people
as
she
left
the
she
said
to
matilda
i
want
a
fire
in
my
room
when
i
come
back
this
evening
please
have
one
every
day
make
out
how
much
it
will
be
and
extra
work
and
i
pay
for
it
whatever
do
you
want
that
for
kitten
the
astonished
matilda
demanded
why
it
is
only
october
yet
no
one
ever
has
a
fire
until
november
even
in
the
let
alone
a
bedroom
it
is
ridiculous
dearie
that
aspect
does
not
matter
at
all
to
me
katherine
retorted
i
want
it
and
so
i
shall
have
it
i
have
some
work
to
do
and
i
am
not
going
to
freeze
matilda
knew
better
than
to
continue
arguing
she
had
not
lived
with
katherine
for
years
for
nothing
she
takes
after
father
in
a
way
she
sighed
to
herself
as
she
began
helping
the
little
servant
to
clear
away
the
breakfast
things
when
they
had
all
departed
to
the
west
end
where
it
was
their
boast
to
announce
that
they
were
all
employed
they
looked
down
upon
the
city
yes
it
father
not
mother
or
her
family
father
would
have
his
way
and
fred
has
got
this
idea
too
but
nothing
like
kitten
how
i
wish
she
look
at
charlie
prodgers
and
get
married
and
settled
then
she
sighed
again
and
sat
down
by
the
window
to
enjoy
her
one
great
pleasure
of
the
day
the
perusal
of
the
in
the
in
these
brief
moments
she
forgot
all
family
worries
all
sordid
cares
and
revelled
in
the
adventures
of
aristocratic
villains
and
persecuted
innocent
governesses
and
actresses
and
felt
she
too
had
a
link
with
the
great
world
she
was
a
good
sound
radical
in
what
represented
politics
to
her
so
she
knew
all
aristocrats
must
be
bad
and
ought
to
be
exterminated
but
she
loved
to
read
about
them
and
hear
descriptions
of
the
female
members
from
gladys
who
saw
many
in
the
showrooms
of
madame
ermantine
glad
she
often
said
to
herself
with
pride
meanwhile
katherine
bush
having
snubbed
prodgers
into
silence
in
the
train
where
he
manoeuvred
to
meet
her
every
morning
reached
her
employers
establishment
and
began
her
usual
typing
there
was
work
to
be
done
by
twelve
in
connection
with
the
renewal
of
the
loan
to
lord
algernon
the
old
marquis
would
be
obliged
to
pay
before
christmas
time
percival
livingstone
said
miss
bush
to
his
intense
astonishment
gave
a
sudden
short
laugh
it
was
quite
mirthless
and
stopped
abruptly
but
it
was
undoubtedly
a
laugh
what
is
amusing
you
he
asked
with
a
full
lisp
too
taken
off
his
guard
to
be
as
refined
and
careful
in
tone
as
usual
the
old
marquis
having
to
pay
of
course
katherine
responded
never
once
during
the
whole
day
did
she
allow
her
thoughts
to
wander
from
her
work
which
she
accomplished
with
her
usual
precision
even
during
her
luncheon
hour
she
deliberately
read
the
papers
she
had
trained
herself
to
do
one
thing
at
a
time
and
the
moment
for
reflection
would
not
come
until
she
could
be
undisturbed
she
would
go
back
as
soon
as
she
was
free
to
her
own
attic
and
there
think
everything
out
and
decide
upon
the
next
step
to
be
taken
in
her
game
of
life
a
few
burnt
sticks
and
a
lump
of
coal
in
the
tiny
grate
were
all
she
discovered
on
her
return
that
evening
to
her
sanctuary
the
was
not
a
talented
and
objected
to
criticism
katherine
level
brows
met
with
annoyance
and
she
proceeded
to
correct
matters
herself
while
she
muttered
inefficient
creature
and
they
say
that
we
are
all
equal
why
ca
she
do
her
work
then
as
well
as
i
can
mine
her
firm
touch
and
common
sense
arrangement
of
paper
and
kindling
soon
produced
a
bright
blaze
and
when
she
had
removed
her
outdoor
things
she
sat
down
to
think
determinedly
she
loved
lord
algy
that
was
the
first
and
most
dominant
thing
to
face
she
loved
him
so
much
that
it
would
never
be
safe
to
see
him
again
since
she
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
ever
drifting
into
the
position
of
being
a
man
mistress
she
had
tasted
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
with
her
eyes
open
and
the
fruit
that
she
had
eaten
was
too
dangerously
sweet
for
continuous
food
love
would
obtain
a
mastery
over
her
if
things
went
on
she
knew
that
she
might
grow
not
to
care
about
anything
else
in
the
world
but
only
algy
thus
obviously
all
connection
with
him
must
be
broken
off
at
once
or
her
career
would
be
at
an
end
and
her
years
of
study
wasted
even
if
he
offered
to
marry
her
she
could
never
take
the
position
with
a
high
hand
there
would
always
be
this
delicious
memory
of
illicit
joys
between
them
which
would
unconsciously
bias
algy
valuation
of
her
she
had
learned
things
of
consequence
which
she
could
not
have
acquired
in
any
other
way
and
now
she
must
have
strength
to
profit
by
them
she
utterly
despised
weaklings
and
had
no
pity
for
lovesick
maidens
for
a
woman
to
throw
over
her
future
for
a
man
was
to
her
completely
contemptible
she
probed
the
possible
consequences
of
her
course
of
action
unflinchingly
she
believed
so
in
her
own
luck
that
she
felt
sure
that
no
awkward
accident
could
happen
to
her
but
even
if
this
should
occur
there
were
ways
which
could
be
discovered
to
help
her
and
since
the
moment
had
not
yet
come
she
would
defer
contemplating
it
but
would
map
out
her
plans
regardless
of
this
contingency
so
she
argued
to
herself
she
could
not
endure
living
under
the
family
roof
of
laburnum
villa
any
longer
that
was
incontestable
she
must
go
out
and
learn
exactly
how
the
ladies
of
lord
algy
world
conducted
themselves
not
that
she
wished
to
dawn
once
more
upon
his
horizon
as
a
polished
vere
de
vere
but
that
for
her
own
satisfaction
she
must
make
herself
his
equal
in
all
respects
there
had
been
so
many
trifles
about
which
she
had
felt
she
had
been
ignorant
almost
every
moment
of
the
three
days
had
given
her
new
visions
and
had
shown
her
her
own
shortcomings
there
are
no
bars
to
anything
in
life
but
stupidity
and
vanity
she
told
herself
and
they
at
least
shall
not
stand
in
my
way
the
temptation
to
have
one
more
farewell
interview
with
him
was
great
but
there
was
nothing
the
least
dramatic
about
her
so
that
aspect
did
not
appeal
to
her
as
it
would
have
done
to
an
ordinary
woman
who
is
ruled
by
emotional
love
for
dramatic
situations
she
was
merely
drawn
by
the
desire
for
her
mate
once
more
and
this
she
knew
and
crushed
it
would
mean
greater
pain
than
pleasure
to
her
afterwards
and
would
certainly
spoil
all
chance
of
a
career
she
gloried
in
the
fact
that
she
had
had
the
courage
to
taste
of
life
joys
for
experience
but
she
would
have
burned
with
shame
to
feel
that
she
was
being
drawn
into
an
equivocal
position
through
her
own
weakness
katherine
bush
was
as
proud
as
lucifer
she
fully
understood
apart
from
moral
questions
which
did
not
trouble
her
that
what
she
had
done
would
have
been
fatal
to
a
fool
like
gladys
or
to
any
girl
except
one
with
her
exceptional
deliberation
and
iron
will
she
truly
believed
that
such
experiments
were
extremely
dangerous
and
on
no
account
to
be
adopted
as
a
principle
of
action
in
general
the
straight
and
narrow
path
of
orthodox
virtue
was
the
only
one
for
most
women
to
follow
and
the
only
one
she
would
have
advocated
for
her
sisters
or
friends
the
proof
being
that
as
a
rule
when
women
erred
they
invariably
suffered
because
they
had
not
the
pluck
or
the
strength
to
know
when
to
stop
katherine
bush
was
absolutely
determined
that
she
should
never
be
hampered
in
her
game
by
her
own
emotions
or
weakness
before
lord
algy
would
return
from
wales
she
would
have
left
liv
and
dev
she
had
never
given
him
her
home
address
and
there
would
be
no
trace
of
her
she
would
look
in
the
for
information
and
then
endeavour
to
secure
some
post
as
companion
or
secretary
to
some
great
lady
there
she
would
pick
up
the
rest
of
the
necessary
equipment
to
make
herself
into
a
person
in
whom
no
flaws
could
be
found
and
when
she
had
accomplished
this
then
fate
would
have
opened
up
some
path
worth
following
some
day
i
shall
be
one
of
the
greatest
women
in
england
she
told
herself
as
she
looked
unblinking
into
the
glowing
coals
then
having
settled
her
plans
she
allowed
herself
to
go
over
the
whole
of
her
little
holiday
incident
by
incident
how
utterly
adorable
algy
had
been
she
found
herself
thrilling
again
at
each
remembrance
how
refined
and
how
considerate
how
easy
were
his
manners
he
was
too
sure
of
himself
and
his
welcome
in
life
ever
to
show
the
deplorable
which
marked
the
friends
who
came
on
sundays
or
the
bumptious
of
her
brothers
fred
and
bert
if
only
she
had
been
born
in
his
world
and
had
by
right
of
birth
those
prerogatives
which
she
meant
to
obtain
by
might
of
intelligence
how
good
it
would
have
been
to
marry
him
for
a
few
years
but
even
now
in
her
moment
of
fierce
passionate
first
love
which
in
her
case
was
so
largely
made
up
of
the
physical
her
brain
was
too
level
and
speculative
not
to
balance
the
pros
and
cons
of
such
a
situation
and
while
she
felt
she
loved
him
with
all
her
being
she
knew
that
he
was
no
match
for
her
intellectually
and
that
when
the
glamour
faded
he
would
weary
her
but
the
wrench
of
present
renunciation
was
none
the
less
bitter
never
any
more
to
feel
his
fond
arms
clasping
her
never
again
to
hear
his
caressing
words
of
love
if
a
coronet
for
her
brow
shone
at
the
end
of
the
climb
her
heart
at
all
events
must
turn
to
ice
by
the
way
or
so
she
felt
at
the
moment
he
had
talked
so
tenderly
about
their
future
meetings
how
they
would
go
again
to
paris
when
he
returned
from
wales
how
she
must
let
him
give
her
pretty
clothes
and
a
diamond
ring
and
how
she
was
his
darling
pet
and
his
own
girl
she
knew
that
he
was
growing
really
to
love
her
katherine
bush
never
deceived
herself
or
attempted
to
throw
dust
in
her
own
eyes
she
had
eaten
her
cake
and
could
not
have
it
if
she
had
held
out
and
drawn
him
on
no
doubt
she
could
have
been
his
wife
but
it
was
only
for
one
second
that
this
thought
agitated
her
yes
she
could
have
been
his
wife
but
to
what
end
only
one
of
humiliation
she
was
not
yet
ready
to
carry
off
such
a
position
with
a
certainty
of
success
she
knew
she
was
ignorant
and
that
the
knowledge
of
such
ignorance
would
destroy
her
and
leave
her
at
the
mercy
of
circumstance
so
all
was
for
the
best
she
had
not
guessed
that
it
would
be
so
very
painful
to
part
from
him
dear
attractive
algy
she
could
not
sit
still
any
longer
a
convulsion
of
anguish
and
longing
shook
her
and
she
got
up
and
stamped
across
the
room
then
she
put
on
her
outdoor
things
again
and
stalked
down
into
the
gathering
night
passionate
emotion
filling
her
soul
but
when
she
came
back
an
hour
later
after
tramping
the
wet
roads
round
the
common
the
battle
was
won
and
this
night
she
fell
asleep
without
any
tears
chapter
iii
it
was
about
a
fortnight
later
that
katherine
got
matilda
to
meet
her
at
a
lyons
popular
caf√©
for
tea
on
a
wednesday
afternoon
livingstone
and
devereux
had
given
her
a
half
holiday
being
on
country
business
bent
and
having
matured
her
plans
and
having
set
fresh
schemes
in
train
she
thought
she
might
as
well
communicate
them
to
the
one
sister
who
mattered
to
her
matilda
loved
an
excuse
to
get
up
to
town
and
had
come
in
her
best
hat
with
smiling
face
katherine
was
always
very
generous
to
her
though
she
was
no
more
careless
about
money
than
she
was
about
other
things
it
is
all
very
well
tild
she
said
in
her
deep
voice
after
they
had
spoken
upon
indifferent
subjects
for
a
while
but
i
am
tired
of
it
i
am
absolutely
tired
of
it
so
there
i
am
tired
of
liv
and
dev
tired
of
the
hateful
old
click
of
the
machine
with
no
change
of
work
i
am
tired
of
seeing
the
people
of
another
class
through
the
glass
screen
and
i
mean
to
get
out
of
it
whatever
are
you
talking
of
kitten
the
elder
miss
bush
exclaimed
as
she
stirred
her
cocoa
why
liv
and
dev
as
good
a
berth
as
get
thirty
bob
a
week
and
a
whole
holiday
on
saturday
to
say
nothing
of
off
times
like
this
you
must
be
mad
dearie
then
something
further
in
her
sister
remark
aroused
comment
and
what
do
you
mean
by
people
of
class
why
are
we
as
good
as
anyone
if
we
had
their
money
katherine
bush
put
down
her
empty
cup
before
she
replied
no
we
not
and
if
you
were
as
ignorant
as
you
are
dear
old
tild
you
know
it
there
are
lots
and
lots
of
classes
above
us
they
may
be
any
cleverer
indeed
they
are
often
fools
and
many
any
richer
but
they
ladies
and
gentlemen
matilda
felt
personally
insulted
upon
my
word
kitten
if
you
are
such
a
poor
thing
that
you
consider
yourself
a
young
lady
i
am
not
i
always
did
say
that
you
would
pick
up
rubbishly
ideas
bothering
after
those
evening
lectures
and
french
classes
instead
of
coming
with
glad
and
bert
and
me
to
the
cinema
like
a
decent
christian
it
was
a
low
sort
of
thing
to
do
i
think
and
looked
as
if
we
none
of
us
had
a
proper
education
and
all
they
have
done
for
you
is
to
unsettle
your
mind
my
dear
so
i
tell
you
katherine
bush
smiled
complacently
and
looked
at
her
sister
straight
in
the
eyes
in
her
disconcerting
way
which
insured
attention
matilda
knew
that
she
would
now
have
to
listen
probably
to
some
home
truths
she
could
manage
gladys
very
well
in
spite
of
her
giggles
and
irresponsibility
but
she
had
never
been
able
to
have
the
slightest
influence
upon
katherine
from
the
moment
of
their
mother
death
years
before
when
she
had
taken
her
place
as
head
of
the
orphaned
household
katherine
had
always
been
odd
she
had
a
vile
temper
as
a
child
and
was
silent
and
morose
and
at
constant
war
with
that
bright
boy
bert
loved
of
the
other
sisters
matilda
remembered
very
well
many
scenes
when
katherine
had
puzzled
her
she
was
so
often
scornful
and
disapproving
and
used
to
sit
there
with
a
book
scowling
at
them
on
sundays
when
a
rowdy
friend
or
two
came
in
to
tea
and
never
once
joined
in
the
chorus
of
the
comic
songs
they
sang
while
she
simply
loathed
the
gramophone
records
you
say
awfully
silly
things
sometimes
tild
katherine
announced
calmly
there
would
not
be
any
good
in
my
considering
myself
a
young
lady
because
at
my
present
stage
anyone
who
really
knew
would
know
that
i
am
not
but
i
mean
to
become
one
some
day
you
can
do
anything
with
will
matilda
bridled
i
do
know
what
more
of
a
lady
you
could
be
than
we
all
are
why
mabel
cawber
always
says
that
we
are
the
most
refined
family
of
the
whole
lot
at
bindon
green
and
mabel
ought
to
know
surely
because
her
father
was
a
solicitor
and
she
has
never
done
a
stroke
of
work
in
her
life
katherine
smiled
again
it
made
matilda
feel
uncomfortable
mabel
is
a
perfect
lady
she
affirmed
indignantly
i
will
be
able
to
tell
you
about
that
in
a
year
time
i
expect
katherine
said
reflectively
at
present
i
am
not
experienced
enough
to
say
but
i
strongly
feel
that
she
is
not
you
see
tild
you
get
your
ideas
of
things
from
the
trash
you
read
and
from
the
ridiculous
nonsense
fred
and
albert
talk
after
they
come
home
from
those
meetings
at
the
national
brotherhood
club
fool
stuff
about
the
equality
of
all
men
of
course
we
are
all
equal
broke
in
matilda
still
ruffled
katherine
bush
smiled
again
well
i
wish
you
could
see
the
difference
between
fred
and
bert
and
those
gentlemen
i
see
through
the
glass
screen
they
have
all
got
eyes
and
noses
and
legs
and
arms
in
common
but
everything
else
is
different
and
if
you
knew
anything
about
evolution
you
understand
why
should
i
indignantly
yes
it
is
the
something
inside
the
head
something
in
the
ideas
produced
by
hundreds
of
years
of
different
environment
and
a
wider
point
of
view
and
it
is
immensely
in
the
little
customs
and
manners
of
speech
and
action
if
you
had
ever
seen
and
spoken
to
a
real
gentleman
tild
you
would
grasp
it
matilda
was
quite
unmollified
and
on
the
defensive
you
ca
have
two
more
honourable
straightforward
young
fellows
than
our
brothers
in
no
family
in
england
and
i
expect
lots
of
your
gents
borrowing
money
are
as
crooked
as
can
be
katherine
became
contemplative
probably
the
thing
i
mean
does
not
lie
in
moral
qualities
i
suppose
it
ought
to
but
it
does
we
had
a
real
sharp
last
week
and
to
look
at
and
to
hear
him
talk
he
was
a
perfect
gentleman
with
refined
and
easy
manners
he
would
never
have
done
anything
in
bad
taste
like
fred
and
bert
often
do
bad
taste
snorted
matilda
yes
we
all
do
no
gentleman
ever
tells
people
in
words
that
he
is
one
fred
and
bert
say
it
once
a
week
at
least
they
lay
the
greatest
stress
on
it
no
real
gentlemen
get
huffy
and
touchy
they
are
too
sure
of
themselves
and
do
not
pretend
anything
they
are
quite
natural
and
you
take
them
as
they
are
they
do
do
one
thing
at
home
at
ease
and
another
when
they
are
dressed
up
and
they
are
a
bit
ashamed
of
knowing
anyone
fred
does
not
speak
to
ernie
gibbs
when
he
is
out
with
mabel
although
they
were
at
school
together
ernie
gibbs
why
kitten
he
is
only
a
foreman
in
the
bindon
gas
works
of
course
not
mabel
take
on
matilda
thought
her
sister
was
being
too
stupid
yes
i
am
sure
she
would
that
is
just
it
and
quite
right
too
katherine
shrugged
her
shoulders
there
was
not
much
use
in
arguing
with
matilda
she
felt
matilda
who
had
never
thought
out
any
problem
for
herself
in
her
life
matilda
who
had
not
the
privilege
of
knowing
any
attractive
lord
algys
and
who
therefore
could
not
have
grasped
the
immeasurable
gulf
that
she
katherine
had
found
lay
between
his
class
and
hers
they
say
fred
is
a
capable
auctioneer
because
father
and
grandfather
were
you
hear
people
saying
is
in
the
blood
well
why
is
it
tild
because
heredity
counts
just
as
it
does
in
animals
of
course
so
why
if
a
man
father
and
grandfather
and
much
further
back
still
have
been
gentlemen
commanding
their
inferiors
and
fulfilling
the
duties
of
their
station
should
not
the
traits
which
mean
that
show
as
plainly
as
the
auctioneer
traits
show
in
fred
matilda
had
no
answer
ready
she
felt
resentful
but
words
did
not
come
so
katherine
went
on
you
ca
jump
straight
to
things
they
either
have
to
come
by
instinct
through
a
long
line
of
forebears
or
you
have
to
have
intelligence
enough
to
make
yourself
acquire
the
outward
signs
of
them
through
watching
and
learning
from
those
who
you
can
see
for
yourself
have
what
you
want
matilda
called
for
another
cup
of
cocoa
she
disliked
these
views
of
katherine
you
see
that
young
woman
went
on
no
one
who
is
a
real
thing
ever
has
to
tell
people
so
in
words
liv
and
dev
do
have
to
say
they
are
two
of
the
sharpest
business
men
in
london
anyone
can
realise
it
who
knows
them
you
and
all
of
us
do
have
to
tell
people
we
belong
to
the
lower
middle
class
because
it
is
plain
to
be
seen
but
we
would
have
to
tell
them
we
were
ladies
and
gentlemen
because
we
are
not
lord
al
oh
any
lord
who
comes
to
our
office
does
not
have
to
say
he
is
an
aristocrat
you
can
see
it
for
yourself
in
a
minute
by
his
ways
it
is
the
shams
that
always
keep
shouting
mabel
cawber
insists
upon
it
that
she
is
a
swell
fred
thinks
he
is
deceiving
everyone
by
telling
them
what
a
gentleman
he
is
and
by
not
speaking
to
ernie
gibbs
who
is
an
awfully
good
fellow
emily
says
she
is
a
splendid
general
and
even
light
a
fire
and
wo
learn
how
to
george
berker
in
our
office
says
he
is
a
clerk
and
muddles
his
accounts
everything
true
speaks
for
itself
i
always
mean
to
be
perfectly
true
and
win
out
by
learning
matilda
though
somewhat
crushed
was
still
antagonistic
i
sure
i
hope
you
succeed
then
my
dear
she
snapped
yes
i
shall
katherine
fired
her
bomb
it
may
take
me
some
time
but
that
does
not
matter
and
the
first
step
i
have
already
taken
is
that
i
am
leaving
liv
and
dev
on
friday
and
i
hope
going
to
be
secretary
to
sarah
lady
garribardine
at
a
hundred
and
ten
berkeley
square
and
blissington
court
blankshire
well
there
you
could
have
knocked
me
over
with
a
feather
as
matilda
told
gladys
later
in
the
evening
and
was
it
like
katherine
never
telling
us
a
thing
about
it
until
everything
was
almost
settled
but
at
the
moment
she
merely
breathed
a
strangled
oh
my
if
i
get
it
i
go
to
my
new
situation
next
week
i
had
a
tremendous
piece
of
luck
coming
across
it
well
however
did
you
do
it
kitten
matilda
demanded
i
saw
an
advertisement
in
the
it
was
quite
a
strange
one
and
seemed
to
be
advertising
for
a
kind
of
someone
who
could
take
down
shorthand
at
lightning
speed
and
typewrite
and
speak
french
and
read
aloud
and
who
had
a
good
knowledge
of
english
literature
and
thoroughly
knew
the
duties
of
a
secretary
oh
my
said
matilda
again
but
you
ca
do
half
of
those
things
kitten
we
none
of
us
know
french
do
we
katherine
smiled
how
little
her
family
understood
her
in
any
way
i
wrote
first
and
said
they
seemed
to
want
a
great
deal
but
as
i
had
been
with
livingstone
and
devereux
for
three
years
and
accustomed
to
composing
every
sort
of
letter
that
a
moneylender
business
required
i
thought
i
could
soon
become
proficient
in
the
other
things
well
i
never
what
cheek
then
i
got
an
answer
saying
lady
garribardine
liked
my
communication
and
if
i
proved
satisfactory
in
appearance
and
had
some
credentials
she
would
engage
me
immediately
because
her
secretary
who
had
been
with
her
for
years
had
gone
to
be
married
the
salary
would
be
ninety
pounds
a
year
with
a
rise
so
it
a
slight
move
up
anyway
as
i
am
to
be
kept
and
live
in
the
house
you
are
cocksure
of
getting
it
katherine
yes
i
mean
to
i
am
going
to
see
her
on
saturday
and
what
are
your
references
besides
liv
and
dev
some
folks
do
like
moneylenders
i
wrote
and
said
i
had
no
others
but
they
would
testify
to
my
capacity
liv
nearly
had
a
fit
when
i
gave
my
notice
he
almost
cried
to
get
me
to
stay
on
i
like
the
old
boy
he
is
a
good
sort
and
will
tell
the
truth
about
me
and
did
they
answer
yes
just
to
say
i
was
to
come
for
the
interview
on
saturday
they
want
to
see
you
anyway
what
is
the
family
i
wonder
here
katherine
recited
the
details
from
debrett
in
which
volume
she
was
very
proficient
an
old
lady
then
matilda
commented
and
with
no
children
except
a
married
daughter
that
will
be
easier
for
you
but
why
is
she
called
i
often
have
wondered
about
that
when
i
read
names
in
the
why
lady
something
and
not
plain
lady
something
it
when
the
man
in
possession
is
married
and
you
are
not
his
mother
katherine
told
her
and
if
you
are
and
still
have
your
christian
name
tacked
on
it
is
to
make
you
sound
younger
dev
says
dowagers
are
quite
out
of
fashion
every
widow
is
or
now
in
the
high
society
and
when
he
first
went
to
business
there
were
only
two
or
three
queen
victoria
never
stood
any
nonsense
matilda
was
very
interested
whatever
will
you
do
about
your
clothes
kitten
you
have
nothing
nobby
and
smart
like
gladys
she
could
lend
you
her
purple
taffeta
if
you
were
so
tall
oh
i
manage
all
right
i
have
a
talk
with
gladys
she
sees
the
right
sort
of
people
at
ermantine
and
can
tell
me
what
to
get
and
i
buy
it
in
my
lunch
hour
well
i
am
just
rattled
matilda
admitted
then
you
be
leaving
home
quite
dearie
yes
tild
and
i
sha
be
sorry
except
to
be
parted
from
you
but
i
daresay
i
shall
be
able
to
come
and
see
you
now
and
then
matilda
looked
tearful
you
never
were
one
of
us
katherine
no
i
know
i
never
was
i
often
have
wondered
what
accident
pitchforked
me
in
among
you
always
the
discordant
note
and
the
wet
blanket
i
hark
back
to
someone
i
suppose
i
always
determined
to
get
out
when
i
was
ready
you
never
did
care
for
us
never
kitten
katherine
bush
remained
quite
unmoved
no
never
for
the
others
but
always
for
you
tild
and
i
never
forget
you
dear
there
do
be
a
donkey
and
cry
the
people
at
the
next
table
are
looking
at
you
this
argument
she
knew
would
calm
her
sister
who
was
intensely
sensitive
to
everyone
opinion
and
supposing
they
do
take
you
matilda
suggested
in
a
still
quavering
voice
and
you
given
notice
to
liv
and
dev
i
call
it
awfully
risky
then
i
will
look
out
for
something
else
i
am
determined
to
make
a
change
and
see
a
new
world
whatever
happens
after
supper
that
evening
gladys
was
invited
up
to
the
warmed
attic
with
matilda
an
honour
she
duly
appreciated
they
all
stood
in
irritated
awe
of
katherine
i
want
to
talk
about
clothes
glad
she
said
when
they
neared
the
tiny
fireplace
i
have
told
tild
i
am
going
about
a
new
berth
on
saturday
this
caused
the
same
astonishment
and
exclamations
as
matilda
had
already
indulged
in
and
when
calm
was
restored
gladys
was
only
too
pleased
to
show
her
superior
knowledge
i
do
want
to
hear
about
any
of
those
actresses
you
dress
or
those
ladies
who
look
like
them
i
want
to
know
what
a
real
quiet
countess
say
would
have
glad
miss
gladys
bush
smiled
contemptuously
oh
a
regular
frump
you
mean
like
the
ones
we
ca
persuade
to
have
tight
skirts
when
they
are
first
the
fashion
or
loose
ones
when
it
changes
that
is
easy
enough
it
is
to
get
look
that
is
difficult
they
probably
would
not
engage
me
if
i
had
look
katherine
remarked
cynically
you
better
have
something
like
we
made
for
lady
beatrice
strobridge
last
week
then
gladys
suggested
one
of
our
hands
can
copy
it
at
home
but
there
wo
be
time
by
saturday
you
better
wear
your
best
blue
serge
and
get
a
new
hat
for
the
first
meeting
lady
beatrice
strobridge
must
be
the
hon
gerard
strobridge
wife
my
new
employer
late
husband
nephew
strobridge
is
the
garribardine
name
katherine
had
looked
up
diligently
the
whole
family
and
knew
the
details
of
each
unit
by
heart
she
only
got
married
two
years
ago
gladys
continued
she
was
thorvil
before
lady
beatrice
thorvil
wife
of
the
present
man
younger
brother
quoted
katherine
remembering
debrett
he
is
about
the
present
man
is
forty
she
is
a
regular
dowdy
anyway
gladys
remarked
one
of
those
we
have
a
bunch
of
them
that
wants
the
things
and
yet
with
their
own
touch
on
them
spoiling
the
style
they
come
together
generally
and
do
make
a
lot
of
fuss
over
each
other
calling
and
all
the
time
fit
to
make
me
and
the
girls
die
laughing
with
their
nonsense
what
is
she
like
katherine
asked
she
only
questioned
when
she
wanted
specific
information
never
idly
and
it
was
as
well
to
know
everything
about
her
possible
new
employer
family
she
would
not
be
bad
if
she
did
not
stoop
so
she
has
got
neither
no
more
than
the
sometimes
she
all
right
at
least
the
things
are
all
right
when
they
go
home
but
she
adds
bits
herself
afterwards
and
spoils
them
here
matilda
interrupted
anyway
she
is
one
of
the
ladies
you
see
in
your
new
place
kitten
i
certainly
have
that
same
dress
it
will
just
show
them
you
are
as
good
as
they
if
you
have
an
ermantine
model
but
katherine
thought
differently
she
agreed
she
would
have
something
in
the
same
subdued
style
as
lady
beatrice
would
have
chosen
but
not
the
actual
copy
and
after
settling
details
the
other
two
sisters
left
her
for
bed
when
they
had
gone
she
sat
by
the
fire
and
looked
deeply
into
it
while
she
thought
for
a
few
moments
then
she
drew
a
letter
from
her
blouse
and
reread
it
it
was
from
lord
algy
a
sweet
little
love
epistle
just
to
tell
her
he
could
not
possibly
wait
for
the
whole
month
before
seeing
her
and
was
coming
up
to
town
the
following
week
and
would
not
she
lunch
with
him
at
the
old
place
and
perhaps
stay
with
him
again
at
the
great
terminus
it
ended
with
protestations
of
passionate
devotion
no
never
again
she
had
tasted
of
the
cup
of
bliss
and
fate
was
asking
her
to
pay
no
price
she
must
have
courage
now
to
renounce
all
further
pleasure
once
was
an
experience
twice
would
be
weakness
which
could
grow
into
a
habit
and
thence
lead
to
an
abyss
which
she
shuddered
to
think
of
katherine
bush
had
never
read
th√©ophile
gautier
masterpiece
but
there
was
something
in
her
character
as
lord
algy
had
remarked
which
resembled
de
she
went
to
her
little
and
got
out
a
sheet
of
paper
and
then
in
her
firm
round
hand
which
looked
like
a
man
she
wrote
him
these
few
lines
i
want
you
to
forget
all
about
me
i
loved
our
little
trip
but
i
am
never
going
on
another
i
shall
have
left
liv
and
dev
before
you
get
back
and
you
wo
see
me
again
with
best
love
always
b
she
folded
it
put
it
in
the
envelope
addressed
it
and
stamped
it
then
she
put
it
ready
to
post
in
the
morning
her
face
was
white
and
set
it
takes
a
strong
will
to
renounce
tangible
present
happiness
however
profound
the
beliefs
in
the
future
may
be
chapter
iv
sarah
lady
garribardine
said
to
her
nephew
gerard
strobridge
who
had
been
lunching
with
her
on
that
saturday

am
expecting

new
secretary

she
was
irreplaceable
so
she
is
i
am
interviewing
quite
a
new
type
she
has
been
a
moneylender
shorthand
typist
strobridge
raised
his
eyebrows
and
smiled
his
whimsical
smile
his
aunt
sarah
always
was
original
then
i
leave
you
beatrice
has
at
last
made
up
her
mind
not
to
chuck
the
arberrys
so
we
motor
down
at
three
has
beatrice
been
unusually
tiresome
she
has
been
writing
odes
all
the
morning
you
ought
never
to
have
married
you
would
not
have
if
alice
southerwood
had
not
become
a
widow
a
man

always
face
his
obvious
obligations
gerard
strobridge
laughed
then
i
shall
kiss
your
hand
and
say
farewell
until
next
week
wisest
of
aunts
he
suited
the
action
to
the
word
and
left
the
room
just
as
the
butler
was
about
to
open
the
door
and
announce
miss
bush
your
ladyship
he
glanced
quickly
at
katherine
this
was
the
young
person
who
would
take
the
estimable
miss
arnott
place
he
supposed
she
was
quite
ordinary
he
went
on
down
the
stairs
come
and
sit
here
in
the
light
please
lady
garribardine
said
as
katherine
bush
came
towards
her
it
was
a
very
katherine
in
the
best
blue
serge
and
a
new
hat
not
of
gladys
choosing
the
mop
of
hair
was
twisted
tight
without
the
least
pretension
to
express
the
look
some
grey
suede
gloves
bought
in
paris
by
lord
algy
were
on
the
wonderful
hands
which
remained
perfectly
still
in
their
owner
lap
how
old
are
you
asked
lady
garribardine
by
way
of
a
beginning
i
was
last
september
there
was
not
a
trace
of
nervousness
in
katherine
bush
deep
voice
indeed
she
felt
none
and
what
does
your
family
consist
of
what
is
your
status
in
life
lady
garribardine
felt
perhaps
she
ought
to
ascertain
this
before
going
further
we
are
just
middle
class
my
father
was
an
auctioneer
at
bindon
green
where
we
live
he
and
my
mother
are
both
dead
i
have
a
sister
who
is
a
saleswoman
at
madame
ermantine
the
others
are
at
home
my
eldest
brother
has
taken
father
place
the
younger
one
is
in
a
bank
and
how
long
have
you
been
at
this
business
since
i
was
nineteen
before
that
i
kept
the
accounts
at
a
pork
butcher
indeed
and
what
makes
you
think
you
would
be
capable
of
filling
my
situation
it
is
not
very
easy
to
be
a
competent
moneylender
secretary
and
a
shorthand
writer
no
perhaps
not
livingston
and
devereux
will
tell
you
that
i
did
not
make
a
failure
of
it
really
katherine
was
silent
lady
garribardine
repeated
again
you
mean
that
you
think
you
can
pick
up
things
quickly
yes
it
is
certainly
an
advantage
i
hoped
to
find
something
exceptional
when
i
advertised
yes
i
noticed
that
and
it
was
because
your
advertisement
was
unusual
that
i
applied
for
the
post
she
rather
wondered
if
she
ought
to
have
put
in
any
ladyships
she
remembered
hanson
lord
algy
valet
was
very
prodigal
of
such
marks
of
respect
that
is
what
had
deterred
her
liv
and
dev
often
used
them
too
to
new
and
prosperously
connected
clients
but
she
did
not
wish
to
be
subservient
more
than
was
necessary
she
would
watch
and
listen
as
she
had
watched
about
the
oysters
can
you
read
aloud
lady
garribardine
was
fixing
her
with
her
flashing
brown
eyes
which
contrasted
so
unfavourably
with
the
wig
she
wore
so
bravely
i
have
never
tried
if
i
did
it
wrong
the
first
time
and
you
corrected
me
i
expect
i
would
do
it
twice
that
is
something
and
your
voice
is
refined
you
did
not
acquire
that
at
the
er
pork
butcher
no
i
acquired
it
by
listening
to
members
of
the
upper
classes
who
came
to
borrow
money
i
had
a
cockney
twang
like
my
sisters
i
daresay
in
the
beginning
that
shows
you
can
learn
things
yes
it
is
only
stupid
people
who
ca
you
are
not
stupid
then
no
but
livingston
or
devereux
can
tell
you
either
will
speak
for
me
lady
garribardine
was
amused
she
digressed
a
little
from
her
you
found
jews
agreeable
to
work
with
very
you
know
where
you
are
with
them
they
do
not
pretend
and
they
are
very
generous
yes
people
have
a
preconceived
notion
of
jews
i
find
quite
faulty
as
a
rule
they
know
what
to
pay
for
they
are
far
less
fools
than
other
races
i
respect
them
that
is
most
interesting
katherine
was
silent
again
why
did
you
leave
them
after
a
pause
in
which
lady
garribardine
was
pitilessly
scrutinising
her
possible
secretary
because
i
had
learned
all
that
i
could
there
and
i
wanted
a
new
vista
and
you
think
you
would
find
it
with
me
with
any
lady
in
your
world
you
can
learn
things
wherever
you
go
if
you
wish
to
very
true
and
how
about
french
you
speak
that
katherine
bush
reddened
a
little
a
memory
came
to
her
of
the
profound
shock
that
the
french
of
paris
had
been
to
her
ear
i
can
write
it
quite
correctly
but
i
have
discovered
that
my
pronunciation
is
ridiculous
she
confessed
it
quite
frankly
how
did
that
happen
i
taught
it
to
myself
mostly
and
then
i
heard
it
spoken
and
i
knew
mine
would
sound
wrong
do
you
think
you
could
overcome
that
yes
if
i
were
in
france
long
enough
have
you
travelled
no
not
really
i
have
been
to
paris
for
a
holiday
once
i
have
only
learnt
about
places
and
english
literature
it
is
the
thing
i
care
most
for
i
have
read
a
great
many
books
i
read
usually
until
about
one
in
the
morning
have
you
a
good
temper
you
are
not
uppish
eh
i
suppose
it
depends
i
know
that
when
you
take
money
to
do
a
thing
you
have
got
to
do
it
and
put
up
with
orders
and
manners
that
you
would
not
stand
for
one
second
if
you
were
the
person
paying
that
is
quite
a
good
definition
of
respectful
service
it
is
common
sense
you
appear
to
have
some
of
that
again
silence
i
have
not
a
good
temper
lady
garribardine
laughed
she
was
greatly
diverted
i
guessed
not
how
i
had
to
read
characters
quickly
at
livingston
and
devereux
you
are
observant
i
think
so
can
you
play
the
piano
i
could
once
and
i
had
a
queer
gift
for
reading
the
notes
but
i
have
never
practised
since
we
had
a
gramophone
i
grew
to
loathe
music
that
is
hopeful
then
her
ladyship
got
up
and
went
to
her
terribly
littered
with
all
sorts
of
papers
she
dived
among
a
conglomerate
mass
and
picked
up
two
letters
would
you
oblige
me
by
answering
these
miss
er
bush
i
could
then
better
judge
of
your
capabilities
katherine
took
them
on
one
envelope
was
written
in
a
spidery
hand
in
pencil
refuse
gracefully
upon
the
other
get
out
as
best
can
she
looked
for
a
portion
of
the
blotting
pad
which
was
clear
enough
to
use
then
she
sat
down
and
selected
a
pen
while
she
glanced
up
with
her
steady
wise
eyes
has
your
ladyship
any
particular
paper
for
this
sort
of
thing
here
was
a
suitable
moment
for
the
use
of
the
honorific
she
felt
yes
that
white
paper
with
the
coronet
in
plain
black
and
the
address
lady
garribardine
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
stared
into
it
she
had
not
been
so
interested
in
a
specimen
of
humanity
for
years
katherine
bush
read
the
letters
through
carefully
and
the
first
one
a
second
time
then
she
began
to
write
to
the
secretary
of
the
league
for
discouraging
polygamy
among
the
mohammedans
of
india
i
am
asked
by
sarah
lady
garribardine
to
tell
you
that
while
sympathising
deeply
with
the
admirable
object
of
your
league
she
thinks
the
field
over
which
it
must
obviously
be
spread
is
too
vast
for
a
small
contribution
to
be
of
much
avail
and
therefore
while
thanking
you
for
your
interesting
papers
upon
the
subject
she
is
sorry
that
she
is
unable
to
forward
you
any
more
substantial
help
i
am
dear
sir
yours
faithfully
katherine
bush
secretary
the
other
letter
ran
to
the
matron
of
the
nonconformist
detention
and
penitential
hostel
for
lost
women
i
beg
to
inform
you
that
sarah
lady
garribardine
is
leaving
town
shortly
and
therefore
can
not
avail
herself
of
the
pleasure
and
honour
of
visiting
your
useful
institution
she
desires
me
to
express
to
you
her
thanks
for
your
invitation
i
remain
madame
yours
faithfully
bush
she
looked
carefully
to
see
what
style
of
address
was
necessary
and
wrote
out
the
envelope
and
when
all
was
ready
she
rose
and
took
them
to
the
lady
by
the
fire
she
stood
quite
still
while
they
were
perused
and
then
smiled
inwardly
when
lady
garribardine
gave
a
cynical
chuckle
i
think
you
will
do
very
well
miss
bush
please
find
some
stamps
and
put
them
in
that
basket
to
be
posted
and
er
you
can
ring
the
bell
i
shall
expect
you
bag
and
baggage
on
wednesday
next
this
was
abrupt
but
katherine
bush
felt
it
was
what
it
should
be
you
do
not
require
the
testimony
of
livingston
or
mr
devereux
no
i
can
judge
for
myself
er
good
morning
the
bell
had
been
answered
almost
instantly
and
so
bowing
katherine
bush
followed
the
servant
down
the
stairs
and
soon
found
herself
in
the
street
a
strange
sense
of
content
in
her
heart
she
knew
the
west
end
very
well
and
walked
briskly
along
hill
street
and
so
on
past
dorchester
house
into
the
park
all
the
leaves
were
off
the
trees
the
november
day
was
beautifully
fine
and
bright
and
movement
was
a
pleasure
so
the
first
part
of
her
new
game
was
won
at
all
events
she
reviewed
the
whole
set
of
impressions
she
had
taken
firstly
that
the
house
was
a
fine
one
it
had
the
look
if
houses
could
be
said
to
show
this
quality
that
is
it
was
beautifully
kept
and
filled
with
what
she
guessed
from
study
at
the
wallace
collection
must
be
rare
and
costly
furniture
there
were
some
things
she
thought
ugly
but
the
look
was
often
ugly
she
knew
by
experience
from
gladys
verbose
descriptions
to
ethel
and
matilda
apart
from
the
look
it
had
an
air
of
distinction
it
was
the
abode
of
denizens
of
lord
algy
world
that
was
evident
the
man
she
had
met
on
the
threshold
of
the
morning
room
door
was
certainly
of
his
class
and
rather
as
for
her
future
employer
she
was
a
new
specimen
to
her
katherine
meant
what
the
french
call
a
but
she
did
not
know
this
expression
she
is
certainly
over
sixty
she
said
to
herself
she
is
a
dark
woman
naturally
and
her
hair
ought
to
be
grey
the
whole
thing
is
spoilt
by
that
silly
golden
wig
curled
tight
like
royalty
she
would
have
quite
a
nice
figure
for
her
age
if
she
were
not
all
pushed
up
by
those
corsets
why
had
she
such
big
ears
and
such
red
hands
for
so
great
a
lady
her
rings
were
buried
in
fat
the
circulation
was
evidently
wrong
somewhere
as
for
her
voice
it
was
one
of
voices
the
female
counterpart
of
the
echoes
from
over
the
glass
screen
and
the
manner
was
quite
as
casual
just
as
insolent
as
i
shall
be
when
i
hold
the
same
sort
of
place
she
was
born
to
it
i
shall
have
acquired
it
we
both
when
we
are
dead
will
be
said
to
have
well
filled
our
situations
thus
mused
katherine
bush
on
a
november
day
in
hyde
park
and
turning
out
of
albert
gate
suddenly
she
almost
walked
into
the
arms
of
lord
algy
chapter
v
darling
pet
what
a
delightful
surprise
algy
where
did
you
spring
from
then
they
both
drew
quick
breaths
come
back
towards
the
serpentine
i
must
talk
to
you
your
horrid
little
note
made
me
feel
quite
wretched
and
i
have
been
to
liv
and
dev
and
they
refused
to
give
me
your
address
why
were
you
such
a
little
cat
darling
i
was
not
a
cat
algy
they
had
turned
and
were
walking
towards
the
row
i
meant
what
i
wrote
i
want
you
to
forget
all
about
me
joys
ca
go
on
i
have
other
things
to
do
dear
but
it
is
perfectly
brutal
of
you
katherine
when
i
love
you
so
and
you
love
me
at
least
you
told
me
that
you
did
katherine
bush
heart
was
beating
very
fast
would
she
have
courage
to
keep
to
her
determination
now
that
she
saw
him
face
to
face
he
looked
so
extremely
delectable
here
in
the
lowering
sunshine
he
was
everything
that
a
woman
could
desire
in
the
way
of
a
lover
i
am
in
the
hell
of
a
mess
too
he
sighed
my
father
has
cut
up
awfully
rough
about
my
transactions
with
liv
and
dev
and
i
had
a
bad
week
at
doncaster
i
am
in
for
a
regular
facer
and
am
obliged
to
agree
to
be
transferred
to
the
egyptian
army
for
three
years
everything
even
you
are
against
me
no
i
am
not
algy
there
was
quick
sympathy
and
distress
in
her
deep
voice
i
hate
to
think
that
you
are
unhappy
and
you
know
that
i
would
help
you
in
any
way
i
could
then
be
kind
to
me
darling
and
do
say
you
never
want
to
see
me
again
katherine
bush
felt
this
was
a
supreme
occasion
and
that
she
must
not
waver
she
so
longed
to
comfort
him
to
let
him
kiss
her
and
forget
all
his
cares
the
cynical
side
of
her
character
even
at
this
moving
moment
whispered
that
it
was
fortunate
that
they
were
out
of
doors
when
do
you
start
for
egypt
as
soon
as
i
can
get
ready
my
mother
and
sisters
are
going
to
winter
out
there
but
probably
i
shall
be
sent
to
the
soudan
katherine
had
heard
that
they
killed
lions
or
something
in
that
part
of
the
world
she
knew
that
sport
meant
a
great
deal
in
lord
algy
life
you
will
get
some
kind
of
shooting
wo
you
she
suggested
by
way
of
consolation
but
lord
algy
looked
full
of
misery
they
had
walked
on
taking
a
side
path
and
were
now
in
sight
of
two
chairs
let
us
go
and
sit
down
he
pleaded
i
want
to
look
at
you
i
ca
i
wo
believe
that
you
do
mean
ever
to
be
my
own
girl
any
more
algy
i
do
mean
it
just
as
much
for
you
as
for
myself
they
had
reached
the
chairs
and
sat
down
lord
algy
pushed
his
hat
to
the
back
of
his
head
his
immaculately
brushed
hair
glistened
bronze
in
the
setting
sun
and
his
forehead
was
puckered
with
distress
his
attractive
eyes
sought
hers
with
a
fond
persistence
katherine
bush
was
obliged
to
clench
her
hands
tight
in
the
pockets
of
her
coat
why
what
in
heaven
name
for
why
must
we
part
he
demanded
fiercely
katherine
i
have
missed
you
awfully
i
have
not
known
what
to
do
with
myself
and
before
this
bother
fell
upon
me
i
had
determined
to
come
up
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
we
be
awfully
happy
married
darling
like
we
were
in
paris
i
have
never
loved
anything
half
so
much
as
our
time
together
it
is
dear
of
you
to
say
that
but
i
would
not
marry
you
for
anything
in
the
world
it
would
spoil
everything
destroy
a
memory
that
has
not
got
any
flaw
in
listen
to
me
algy
i
went
with
you
because
i
wanted
to
i
wanted
to
understand
life
and
find
out
what
is
worth
while
and
what
men
are
like
i
am
only
at
the
beginning
of
existence
and
i
intend
to
learn
most
of
its
meaning
before
i
die
i
thought
that
whatever
cold
tiresome
path
i
might
have
to
follow
afterwards
to
carry
out
my
scheme
of
things
i
would
at
least
have
some
good
hours
to
remember
with
you
so
i
went
deliberately
but
i
never
meant
to
do
it
again
let
both
be
grateful
for
what
we
have
had
and
part
friends
i
simply
ca
protested
lord
algy
growing
more
and
more
full
of
emotion
as
he
felt
the
attainment
of
his
desires
receding
from
him
i
call
it
awfully
of
you
katherine
and
i
ca
and
consent
to
it
i
want
you
i
want
you
now
and
he
stretched
out
his
arms
i
am
sick
with
longing
for
you
i
mean
it
darling
i
have
been
away
with
other
girls
often
before
jack
kilcourcy
and
i
stayed
down
the
river
with
laure
de
laine
and
mary
green
this
june
laure
was
my
friend
and
she
simply
was
a
patch
on
you
pet
in
any
way
and
i
did
care
a
straw
when
it
was
over
although
they
are
such
celebrities
and
it
did
make
berty
aberhams
so
mad
and
was
such
a
score
off
the
bounder
i
have
never
felt
anything
like
i
feel
for
you
darling
i
want
you
to
be
my
wife
as
he
spoke
something
withered
a
little
in
katherine
bush
his
unconscious
placing
of
the
affair
galled
her
although
she
knew
that
it
was
perfectly
just
she
had
gone
with
him
under
no
other
pretence
than
had
gone
those
ladies
of
the
frivolity
theatre
she
analysed
his
simple
directness
and
appreciated
the
triumph
conveyed
to
her
in
the
final
expression
of
his
feelings
but
it
made
her
task
rather
easier
she
saw
so
plainly
what
a
renewal
of
their
relations
would
mean
she
looked
and
looked
at
him
seated
dejectedly
there
beside
her
and
then
she
spoke
and
her
voice
was
full
of
quiet
determination
and
very
deep
you
must
be
a
man
algy
dear
and
go
on
and
make
something
of
your
life
as
i
mean
to
do
you
must
be
a
great
soldier
you
come
of
such
a
grand
old
family
you
ought
to
remember
what
all
your
ancestors
have
done
and
try
to
be
as
fine
as
they
were
it
so
paltry
to
drift
you
can
remember
me
if
you
want
to
as
someone
who
was
weak
even
though
i
am
only
a
common
girl
and
much
beneath
you
in
class
if
i
was
of
your
class
i
should
now
be
tempted
to
marry
you
and
then
i
expect
with
my
sort
of
nature
i
just
shove
you
on
into
doing
something
great
but
i
could
as
it
is
all
my
time
would
be
taken
up
with
trying
to
educate
myself
to
keep
my
own
head
above
water
and
trying
to
suppress
my
humiliation
at
the
contempt
of
your
friends
you
are
only
a
younger
son
and
they
would
never
forgive
you
and
we
would
just
lead
a
hole
and
corner
sort
of
existence
in
wretched
poverty
and
grow
to
have
quarrels
and
not
love
at
all
illustration
must
go
on
and
make
something
of
your
life
as
i
mean
to
do
he
was
going
to
interrupt
her
but
she
put
her
grey
gloved
hand
across
his
lips
no
dear
do
say
anything
i
want
to
go
away
from
you
with
the
memory
that
you
have
asked
me
to
be
your
wife
i
can
not
be
that
for
both
our
sakes
and
it
would
cut
me
to
the
heart
to
hear
you
say
words
now
that
you
know
this
which
would
mean
that
you
want
me
failing
that
to
go
on
with
the
other
relation
she
paused
for
a
second
and
leaning
forward
looked
straight
into
his
face
algy
i
want
to
remember
you
as
a
really
perfect
gentleman
she
had
gained
her
point
with
this
last
appeal
she
saw
that
in
an
instant
he
straightened
himself
and
raised
his
handsome
head
while
the
pride
of
race
looked
forth
from
his
eyes
for
a
moment
and
then
was
quenched
by
the
mist
of
tears
you
are
a
splendid
girl
katherine
he
said
in
a
choking
voice
a
far
greater
lady
than
the
rotters
i
have
to
dance
with
at
balls
and
see
as
my
sisters
friends
you
by
jove
you
have
taught
me
to
respect
women
i
should
be
honoured
if
you
would
marry
me
and
my
family
ought
to
be
jolly
glad
to
get
such
a
good
sort
among
them
thank
you
algy
her
voice
now
trembled
too
then
you
understand
dear
and
i
want
you
to
do
just
as
well
as
you
can
in
egypt
and
and
algy
do
try
not
to
spend
so
much
money
and
when
they
have
paid
up
for
you
do
go
and
get
back
into
any
moneylender
hands
they
are
not
all
so
honest
as
liv
and
dev
and
now
i
want
to
say
i
do
want
to
be
silly
and
cry
oh
it
too
cruel
he
exclaimed
clasping
his
hands
katherine
you
are
like
only
i
think
you
mean
to
be
kinder
than
she
was
de
she
stiffened
and
her
eyes
which
were
growing
very
misty
became
hard
and
bright
she
thought
he
was
referring
to
another
lady
of
the
of
paris
perhaps
this
time
he
saw
that
she
had
misunderstood
him
and
he
added
quickly
darling
she
is
in
a
book
by
a
fellow
called
th√©ophile
gautier
she
was
a
wonder
and
so
are
you
i
always
thought
you
were
like
her
but
oh
why
do
we
talk
such
bosh
about
books
in
our
few
moments
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
love
you
oh
katherine
if
you
knew
how
much
the
hardness
all
melted
from
the
young
woman
eyes
and
was
replaced
by
a
divine
sweetness
algy
she
whispered
it
is
good
to
hear
that
and
you
know
that
i
love
you
too
and
now
my
dear
i
ca
bear
any
more
she
rose
quickly
and
drew
her
hand
away
she
passionately
longed
for
him
to
take
her
in
his
arms
he
got
up
also
he
was
extremely
pale
and
more
than
a
suspicion
of
mist
hung
upon
his
eyelashes
as
a
young
splendid
lover
he
could
not
have
looked
more
desirable
but
katherine
bush
never
lost
her
head
algy
and
god
bless
you
dear
two
people
were
approaching
or
he
certainly
would
have
kissed
her
as
it
was
they
only
wrung
each
other
hands
and
katherine
bush
turned
and
walked
into
the
gathering
twilight
he
watched
her
until
she
had
disappeared
and
then
sat
down
again
he
felt
quite
wretched
she
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
wonderful
character
what
an
impotent
wretch
i
am
beside
her
he
said
to
himself
but
i
should
never
be
able
to
make
the
family
see
it
my
mother
would
rather
i
married
elaine
percival
with
her
five
thousand
a
year
then
he
laughed
contemptuously
elaine
percival
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
began
to
reason
about
things
katherine
bush
was
of
course
perfectly
right
marriage
would
have
been
madness
as
he
had
always
known
before
he
became
too
much
in
love
to
think
and
he
knew
he
had
been
lately
only
entirely
influenced
by
selfish
desire
and
had
never
so
much
as
faced
what
the
consequences
would
be
either
to
himself
or
to
her
he
had
been
quite
ready
to
make
a
hash
of
both
their
lives
just
because
he
wanted
her
so
badly
for
the
moment
what
an
incredible
fool
and
she
this
fine
girl
had
pulled
them
both
on
to
firm
land
he
was
not
of
the
type
who
could
contemplate
asking
a
woman
to
wait
for
him
while
he
worked
to
obtain
a
home
for
her
such
an
idea
of
course
never
entered
his
head
he
had
no
romantic
illusions
of
this
sort
and
once
having
realised
the
hopelessness
of
the
case
he
had
stoicism
enough
to
accept
it
but
the
things
she
had
said
affected
him
deeply
he
would
try
not
to
he
would
pull
himself
together
and
do
his
best
to
become
a
fine
soldier
they
should
not
say
he
had
grumbled
over
going
to
egypt
oh
if
there
could
only
be
a
war
that
he
might
go
out
and
fight
but
wars
would
never
happen
again
at
this
time
of
the
world
day
the
present
pleasant
easy
stage
of
his
life
had
come
to
an
end
and
unpleasant
realities
must
be
dealt
with
but
he
would
keep
ever
the
memory
of
this
splendid
girl
in
his
heart
the
memory
that
she
had
not
been
weak
or
permitted
him
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
or
of
her
and
as
he
walked
on
out
of
the
park
he
felt
a
new
and
determination
meanwhile
katherine
bush
had
got
into
an
omnibus
and
was
on
the
way
to
victoria
and
once
arrived
at
laburnum
villa
and
her
attic
she
carefully
wrote
down
on
the
little
book
which
she
kept
for
jottings
de
in
a
book
by
th√©ophile
gautier
while
her
thoughts
ran
he
did
not
say
what
was
the
name
of
the
story
but
i
can
read
the
whole
lot
this
man
wrote
i
go
to
a
french
library
on
monday
then
she
sat
down
in
her
armchair
by
the
fire
and
reviewed
the
entire
chain
of
events
she
was
embarked
upon
a
new
current
which
would
help
to
carry
her
to
some
definite
goal
she
was
out
of
the
backwater
it
was
not
a
voyage
to
cythera
but
youth
was
at
the
prow
and
ambition
not
pleasure
at
the
helm
and
there
live
philosophers
who
say
these
two
things
bring
more
lasting
good
than
all
the
bliss
that
is
to
be
snatched
from
the
other
who
knows
they
may
be
right
matilda
was
nervous
with
excitement
when
after
supper
she
was
told
of
the
definite
settlement
of
her
sister
affairs
so
you
are
really
engaged
kitten
she
exclaimed
now
do
tell
me
all
about
it
there
a
dear
and
what
was
she
like
and
is
it
a
grand
house
and
are
you
going
to
be
properly
treated
as
a
real
lady
yes
i
am
engaged
i
am
to
go
in
on
wednesday
and
baggage
as
lady
garribardine
said
my
what
a
vulgar
expression
for
a
lady
to
use
kitten
are
you
sure
she
all
right
matilda
hated
what
was
not
genteel
oh
yes
tild
she
all
right
and
the
house
is
beautiful
and
yes
what
you
call
grand
and
you
may
be
sure
they
will
treat
me
exactly
in
the
way
i
deserve
to
be
treated
if
you
are
respected
it
your
own
fault
people
do
make
a
mistake
as
to
whom
they
are
with
a
second
time
even
if
they
do
the
first
if
anyone
gets
put
upon
continually
or
gets
snubbed
it
her
own
fault
matilda
totally
disagreed
there
you
are
quite
wrong
why
look
at
gladys
bob
treats
her
anyhow
sometimes
of
a
sunday
and
her
as
good
as
gold
well
she
has
made
him
think
that
he
can
by
not
stopping
it
in
the
beginning
it
is
never
a
question
of
goodness
as
i
often
tell
you
about
things
it
is
a
question
of
force
goodness
does
not
count
unless
it
is
so
perfect
that
it
is
a
force
too
like
christ
oh
my
what
awful
things
you
do
say
katherine
matilda
felt
so
uncomfortable
when
her
sister
spoke
of
what
she
thought
ought
only
to
be
mentioned
in
church
no
i
merely
tell
the
truth
it
is
the
weaklings
who
do
all
the
harm
in
the
world
never
the
bad
or
good
well
what
was
lady
garribardine
like
matilda
was
tired
of
abstract
speculations
she
was
tall
and
rather
stout
and
had
a
golden
wig
and
black
eyes
and
she
understood
things
she
knows
how
to
order
her
house
because
the
servants
had
the
same
awe
for
her
as
the
has
for
liv
her
was
awfully
untidy
though
i
expect
she
has
not
much
method
and
it
is
just
personality
and
temper
which
causes
her
to
be
obeyed
you
wo
stand
being
ordered
about
ever
kitten
it
will
depend
on
how
much
good
i
feel
i
am
getting
out
of
it
if
the
place
and
people
in
it
are
being
lessons
for
me
i
sha
mind
what
she
says
i
shall
stick
it
out
and
try
never
really
to
deserve
a
scolding
was
there
anyone
else
there
matilda
was
still
curious
yes
a
man
left
when
i
was
going
in
he
had
a
clever
face
i
shall
like
him
i
believe
if
he
comes
there
often
you
wo
go
falling
in
love
with
any
of
them
gentlemen
kitten
matilda
pleaded
affectionately
she
felt
that
things
might
develop
as
they
did
in
the
cases
of
the
innocent
actresses
and
governesses
and
the
villains
in
her
serials
have
i
ever
been
given
to
falling
in
love
katherine
asked
with
a
humorous
flash
in
her
you
have
not
seen
me
tumble
into
the
arms
of
charlie
prodgers
or
percy
watson
have
you
no
dearie
but
these
gentlemen
in
your
new
biz
might
be
different
and
might
not
mean
so
honest
by
you
i
do
wish
i
could
hope
to
see
you
settled
with
charlie
some
day
he
is
such
a
dear
fellow
and
very
rising
he
be
head
clerk
at
the
estate
agent
he
is
in
very
soon
and
could
give
you
a
comfortable
home
like
this
is
for
your
own
and
no
need
to
be
hanging
on
for
years
like
glad
and
bob
can
you
picture
me
settled
in
a
comfortable
home
with
charlie
prodgers
tild
katherine
laughed
out
at
the
idea
it
seemed
so
comic
to
her
he
is
as
great
a
snob
as
fred
and
even
more
ignorant
i
would
not
let
him
button
my
boots
much
less
call
himself
my
husband
i
as
soon
be
dead
as
tied
to
that
at
brixton
too
with
the
prospect
of
being
the
mother
of
numbers
of
little
prodgers
what
an
outlook
matilda
was
hurt
they
had
never
spoken
in
words
upon
this
secret
hope
of
hers
but
she
had
often
hinted
at
it
and
katherine
had
been
silent
and
seemingly
preoccupied
but
not
actually
scornful
and
to
have
the
scheme
denounced
with
derision
and
the
happy
picture
scoffed
at
was
a
blow
to
her
which
she
could
not
bear
in
silence
she
felt
indignant
charlie
prodgers
is
good
enough
for
any
young
lady
mabel
herself
thinks
highly
of
him
he
is
one
of
the
few
of
fred
gentlemen
friends
that
she
thinks
worthy
to
be
asked
into
her
mother
house
and
i
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
you
married
into
her
set
safely
before
she
becomes
our
and
can
patronise
you
then
i
am
afraid
i
must
disappoint
you
dear
katherine
now
tried
to
hide
her
smile
i
have
quite
another
game
to
play
in
life
but
why
do
you
keep
him
for
ethel
she
is
nearly
sixteen
and
will
soon
be
looking
out
for
a
young
man
or
take
him
yourself
this
was
a
new
idea
for
matilda
she
had
always
been
too
loyal
to
dream
of
turning
her
eye
in
the
direction
of
one
whom
she
regarded
as
exclusively
her
sister
property
she
bridled
a
little
the
picture
was
so
glorious
if
it
only
could
be
hers
charlie
prodgers
who
scorned
to
be
seen
in
anything
but
a
frock
coat
unless
of
course
he
went
golfing
charlie
prodgers
who
each
sunday
attended
the
church
parade
in
hyde
park
as
a
matter
of
course
but
would
he
ever
look
at
her
proud
haughty
fellow
and
she
not
so
pretty
as
katherine
and
not
half
so
nobby
as
gladys
but
stranger
things
than
that
happened
in
her
serials
and
she
need
not
feel
that
it
was
quite
hopeless
but
how
could
kitten
willingly
relinquish
such
triumph
there
must
be
something
of
a
suffragette
in
her
after
all
since
no
girl
in
her
senses
could
ask
more
of
fortune
the
sunday
was
spent
by
katherine
in
packing
up
all
her
belongings
and
in
selecting
the
books
she
meant
to
take
with
her
a
volume
or
two
of
voltaire
bacon
essays
kant
and
bergson
and
a
new
acquisition
otto
weininger
sex
and
character
this
latter
had
interested
her
deeply
there
was
a
great
deal
of
biting
truth
in
his
analysis
of
women
and
it
was
probably
also
true
that
they
did
not
possess
souls
but
she
totally
disagreed
with
his
ending
of
the
matter
that
the
solution
of
the
problem
lay
in
a
voluntary
annihilation
of
the
human
species
through
abstinence
from
procreation
she
for
her
part
thought
that
it
was
taking
things
out
of
the
hand
of
god
or
the
divine
essence
or
whatever
the
great
principle
should
be
called
and
her
eminently
practical
mind
failed
to
see
the
use
of
such
speculations
the
poor
man
was
mad
of
course
she
said
as
she
closed
the
book
again
before
packing
it
but
i
will
try
to
watch
the
feminine
traits
in
myself
and
crush
them
he
has
taught
me
that
amount
in
any
case
and
if
i
have
no
soul
i
have
a
brain
and
a
will
and
so
i
am
going
to
obtain
as
much
as
a
woman
can
get
with
those
two
things
as
for
the
infinite
men
are
welcome
to
that
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
she
looked
forward
with
deep
interest
to
perusing
the
story
with
de
in
it
what
could
it
be
about
she
had
hardly
thought
that
lord
algy
had
read
at
all
he
never
spoke
of
books
but
it
was
perhaps
not
surprising
they
had
been
always
too
occupied
in
more
agreeable
converse
how
good
it
was
to
remember
all
that
even
though
never
in
her
life
she
should
have
such
foolish
sweetness
again
she
had
not
the
slightest
sentiment
about
leaving
home
she
would
have
found
such
a
thing
quite
ridiculous
on
the
contrary
a
sense
of
exaltation
filled
her
she
was
going
forever
from
this
cramped
small
attic
and
the
uncongenial
environment
of
the
house
and
she
must
hold
herself
in
stern
command
and
never
waste
an
opportunity
to
improve
herself
in
manner
and
mind
of
course
she
might
be
liable
to
make
a
few
mistakes
at
first
and
the
work
might
be
hard
but
if
will
was
strong
and
emotions
were
checked
the
road
to
success
and
development
of
her
personality
could
not
be
a
long
one
and
when
she
had
gained
freedom
how
splendidly
would
she
use
it
there
should
be
no
false
values
for
her
her
new
dress
the
one
in
the
style
of
lady
beatrice
strobridge
would
be
home
by
the
tuesday
night
and
she
had
got
a
dressy
blouse
from
oxford
street
in
case
she
should
ever
have
to
appear
in
the
evenings
she
would
do
very
well
she
felt
the
family
with
the
exception
of
matilda
were
not
sorry
that
she
was
departing
the
father
had
left
laburnum
villa
and
a
certain
sum
to
keep
it
up
for
the
benefit
of
the
whole
bunch
of
them
and
when
frederick
bush
would
move
into
a
house
of
his
own
with
the
refined
mabel
cawber
gladys
and
bert
and
ethel
looked
forward
to
an
uninterrupted
time
of
jollity
unclouded
by
katherine
aloofness
and
contempt
matilda
alone
grieved
in
secret
she
thought
katherine
was
superior
to
them
all
in
spite
of
her
reserve
and
the
last
evening
while
she
sat
with
her
by
the
attic
fire
she
told
her
so
no
i
am
not
tild
i
am
not
superior
i
am
just
different
all
our
aims
are
as
wide
apart
as
the
poles
glad
and
ethel
and
the
boys
never
want
to
learn
anything
they
resent
the
thought
that
there
could
be
anything
that
they
do
not
know
their
whole
attitude
is
resentful
towards
any
knowledge
they
like
to
browse
on
deceiving
themselves
over
every
question
and
aspect
of
life
so
they
will
all
just
stay
where
they
are
fred
an
auctioneer
henpecked
by
mabel
bert
a
clerk
poor
glad
the
downtrodden
drudge
of
bob
hartley
and
ethel
probably
something
of
the
same
you
dear
old
tild
will
be
a
sentimental
old
maid
looking
after
the
others
children
because
you
are
entirely
a
woman
unless
you
take
charlie
prodgers
as
i
said
the
other
day
and
have
heaps
of
little
prodgers
oh
it
is
all
just
respectable
comfortable
squalor
and
words
wo
express
how
glad
i
am
to
get
out
of
it
matilda
was
quite
incensed
i
rather
be
a
lady
however
poor
in
my
own
circle
and
treated
as
such
there
than
a
servant
in
a
grand
house
as
you
going
to
be
kitten
i
let
them
see
i
be
above
taking
their
orders
she
hoped
this
taunt
would
tell
but
katherine
only
smiled
poor
dear
old
tild
she
said
you
do
not
know
perhaps
that
it
is
a
wise
man
who
understands
how
to
obey
those
placed
over
him
and
to
exact
the
same
obedience
from
those
beneath
when
i
have
learned
my
lessons
and
have
obtained
a
place
of
command
then
i
shall
not
only
enforce
obedience
but
i
shall
remove
from
my
path
anyone
who
crosses
my
will
oh
my
gasped
matilda
do
you
suppose
i
argued
with
liv
and
dev
and
showed
them
that
i
would
not
take
their
orders
no
of
course
not
they
valued
me
and
raised
my
salary
because
i
did
what
i
was
told
to
do
they
were
paying
me
money
and
were
in
a
position
to
command
no
one
forced
me
to
take
their
money
i
went
there
of
my
own
free
will
and
was
to
do
specified
things
for
a
specified
remuneration
i
did
them
to
the
best
of
my
ability
and
so
i
am
going
on
to
something
better
lady
garribardine
is
paying
me
ninety
pounds
a
year
with
a
rise
and
i
am
to
be
hers
to
command
for
certain
things
when
i
have
learned
all
that
that
situation
can
teach
me
i
shall
get
a
larger
and
higher
position
and
so
on
until
i
reach
my
goal
when
i
shall
rule
do
not
fear
tild
shall
i
daresay
you
will
matilda
admitted
awed
katherine
face
had
a
strange
compelling
force
when
she
spoke
thus
but
we
are
all
the
same
kitten
glad
for
instance
has
more
pride
look
how
she
left
brown
and
melbury
where
she
was
getting
more
than
at
ermantine
because
she
would
not
take
orders
from
the
new
manager
they
put
over
her
department
that
sort
of
pride
was
entirely
worthy
of
gladys
intelligence
and
it
had
landed
her
with
a
less
salary
no
one
added
respect
and
not
much
to
look
forward
to
in
the
future
and
then
with
a
burst
of
feeling
oh
tild
if
i
only
could
make
laws
i
would
enforce
education
to
such
an
extent
that
there
could
not
be
left
any
fools
like
gladys
then
she
said
to
matilda
and
gently
pushed
her
from
the
room
where
she
looked
as
though
she
meant
to
stay
for
another
and
returning
to
her
armchair
she
began
to
read
that
book
of
th√©ophile
gautier
which
she
had
bought
on
the
monday
morning
and
discovered
that
its
title
was
simply
mademoiselle
de
maupin
chapter
vi
lady
garribardine
was
having
a
with
some
good
music
when
katherine
bush
arrived
she
realised
immediately
that
it
was
stupid
of
her
to
have
chosen
the
afternoon
for
her
entrance
into
her
new
post
and
bronson
the
dignified
butler
left
her
in
no
doubt
as
to
his
view
of
the
matter
as
he
directed
the
hurried
transport
of
her
luggage
through
the
hall
her
ladyship
expected
you
this
morning
miss
he
said
severely
then
she
should
have
told
me
at
what
hour
i
was
to
come
katherine
answered
quietly
she
mentioned
none
bronson
stared
miss
arnott
clergyman
daughter
though
she
was
would
never
have
said
a
thing
like
that
she
would
have
been
nervous
and
apologetic
in
a
minute
poor
thing
but
this
young
woman
whom
bronson
had
very
good
reason
to
believe
from
what
he
had
been
able
to
gather
belonged
merely
to
the
lower
middle
class
had
yet
the
audacity
to
give
herself
all
the
airs
and
calm
assurance
appertaining
to
a
lady
of
the
world
here
the
entrance
of
two
guests
took
up
his
attention
a
man
and
a
woman
katherine
stood
back
and
waited
for
directions
while
she
watched
closely
the
man
was
the
same
that
she
had
seen
on
the
former
occasion
the
woman
interested
her
she
was
tall
and
droopy
with
wide
vague
eyes
and
a
wisp
of
buffish
chiffon
about
her
neck
inside
her
furs
which
bronson
assisted
her
to
remove
then
katherine
saw
that
she
wore
the
dress
which
gladys
had
described
and
which
in
its
general
features
had
been
taken
more
or
less
as
the
model
for
her
own
this
must
be
lady
beatrice
strobridge
gerard
the
lady
said
rather
querulously
i
do
mean
to
stay
for
more
than
ten
minutes
so
do
get
away
into
some
difficult
corner
with
l√§o
if
you
mean
to
leave
with
me
the
man
answered
with
polite
indifference
bronson
will
see
you
safely
to
the
motor
i
promised
my
aunt
to
stay
to
hear
venzoni
he
is
sure
to
be
late
then
they
went
on
up
the
marble
stairs
and
a
young
footman
was
sent
with
katherine
bush
in
the
lift
at
the
back
of
the
hall
it
is
a
nice
name
and
he
looks
a
nice
man
she
mused
while
they
were
carried
aloft
and
he
is
bored
with
his
wife
gladys
was
quite
right
why
did
she
have
that
rag
of
chiffon
it
spoilt
the
whole
dress
the
housekeeper
met
her
when
they
arrived
in
the
top
passage
and
took
her
under
her
wing
some
tea
will
be
sent
to
your
room
miss
she
informed
her
and
her
ladyship
said
she
would
not
have
time
to
see
you
this
evening
but
you
would
doubtless
have
things
to
unpack
and
arrangements
to
make
for
yourself
your
trunks
will
be
up
in
a
minute
and
then
she
opened
the
door
into
a
back
room
which
faced
west
so
the
afterglow
of
the
setting
sun
made
it
not
quite
dark
there
was
a
fire
burning
and
it
all
appeared
gay
when
the
housekeeper
turned
on
the
lights
with
its
chintz
on
a
bright
ground
there
was
a
scent
of
lavender
too
and
katherine
bush
was
pleasantly
impressed
nothing
looked
cheap
and
gimcrack
like
the
bedrooms
in
laburnum
villa
she
thought
or
still
more
those
at
the
house
of
mabel
cawber
which
were
the
envy
of
matilda
soul
the
furniture
here
was
solid
mahogany
of
early
victorian
make
and
the
armchair
gave
the
impression
that
it
would
be
a
pleasant
place
to
rest
in
when
she
was
alone
katherine
bush
made
herself
take
in
every
detail
lady
garribardine
had
suggested
that
she
was
observant
she
must
remember
that
and
always
cultivate
this
faculty
for
she
realised
that
every
trifling
thing
would
be
different
from
anything
she
had
ever
known
she
liked
the
space
of
the
place
she
would
not
feel
that
she
was
tumbling
over
things
there
was
an
empty
bookcase
awaiting
her
books
no
doubt
and
a
big
sensible
there
in
the
window
where
there
would
be
plenty
of
light
the
wardrobe
was
a
monster
ample
room
in
it
for
any
amount
of
clothes
how
pleasant
not
to
have
to
put
most
things
away
in
cardboard
boxes
under
one
bed
often
to
find
them
discoloured
by
dust
when
taking
them
out
again
and
how
pretty
and
quaint
was
the
china
on
the
washstand
matching
the
chintz
and
the
towels
of
finer
quality
and
nearly
as
many
as
there
had
been
at
the
palatial
in
paris
which
she
had
supposed
was
a
case
of
french
hotel
extravagance
and
not
what
would
be
the
custom
in
private
life
she
fingered
them
softly
they
were
arranged
peculiarly
too
with
the
top
fold
turned
back
so
that
one
could
pick
them
up
in
a
second
katherine
bush
smiled
cynically
when
she
remembered
her
two
coarse
huckabacks
changed
only
every
saturday
at
laburnum
villa
everything
gave
the
impression
of
spotless
cleanliness
and
order
the
brass
can
and
the
fender
and
the
all
shone
with
superlative
polishing
presently
her
tea
was
brought
up
by
a
housemaid
in
neatest
black
with
a
cap
and
apron
which
would
have
made
snort
with
indignation
had
she
been
asked
to
wear
them
so
unmodish
was
their
style
it
was
a
joy
to
have
a
perfectly
arranged
with
shining
silver
and
pretty
porcelain
a
tray
all
to
herself
too
instead
of
a
breakfast
cup
already
poured
out
and
mixed
with
milk
and
sugar
and
probably
a
little
of
the
contents
upset
into
the
saucer
which
also
contained
a
thick
slice
of
bread
and
butter
and
a
piece
of
cake
this
is
what
she
had
always
been
accustomed
to
at
the
office
or
on
saturday
afternoons
at
home
while
she
read
her
books
and
a
sister
brought
her
tea
up
to
her
attic
and
with
the
exceptions
of
a
lyons
or
an
a
restaurant
and
the
brief
time
of
glory
in
paris
when
chocolate
was
the
order
of
the
day
this
one
unappetizing
cup
had
represented
to
her
what
many
women
look
forward
to
as
the
most
delightful
meal
of
all
the
housemaid
manner
had
been
quiet
and
respectful
as
she
drew
the
curtains
and
shut
out
the
dying
light
the
muffin
was
done
to
a
turn
and
above
all
the
tea
tasted
as
tea
had
never
tasted
before
she
was
too
ignorant
as
yet
to
know
that
it
was
china
not
the
rankest
ceylon
which
she
was
accustomed
to
but
she
found
it
particularly
nice
though
rather
weak
the
whole
room
and
the
service
and
the
atmosphere
spoke
of
inhabitants
who
somehow
she
knew
belonged
to
the
same
class
as
those
whose
voices
she
had
always
admired
from
beyond
the
glass
screen
she
sat
and
dreamed
for
a
while
before
beginning
her
unpacking
her
heart
ached
underneath
for
lord
algy
but
aches
are
possible
to
bear
when
there
is
an
element
of
triumph
and
about
them
she
was
quite
aware
that
she
had
behaved
remarkably
well
and
in
a
manner
which
lord
algy
could
never
look
back
upon
but
with
respect
and
to
renounce
happiness
and
union
when
the
other
person
is
clamouring
for
a
continuance
of
relations
brings
a
great
measure
of
consolation
because
there
is
no
wound
to
the
no
disastrous
feeling
that
but
for
personal
stupidity
the
ache
need
not
be
there
is
even
a
melancholy
pleasure
in
it
giving
a
pensive
sadness
not
all
pain
after
a
while
she
began
to
arrange
her
clothes
and
books
and
it
had
struck
seven
before
all
was
complete
and
she
had
sat
down
again
to
finish
mademoiselle
de
maupin
which
had
so
thrilled
her
far
into
the
night
she
read
french
quite
easily
but
she
was
not
accustomed
to
judge
of
its
style
and
as
yet
hardly
appreciated
but
the
story
the
cynical
enchanting
wonderful
story
seized
hold
of
her
imagination
as
she
read
the
last
words
the
book
dropped
into
her
lap
and
she
stared
in
front
of
her
she
saw
what
lord
algy
had
meant
and
it
flattered
her
greatly
she
understood
entirely
feelings
how
wise
she
had
been
to
go
how
she
had
grasped
the
salient
points
of
life
and
she
katherine
bush
no
great
lady
but
a
daughter
of
the
lower
middle
class
had
evolved
some
such
instincts
herself
had
played
her
game
with
equal
coolness
and
had
lived
through
some
such
joys
she
thrilled
and
thrilled
the
subtle
whimsical
polished
wit
of
the
book
seemed
to
open
some
new
vista
of
comprehension
to
her
she
did
not
perceive
its
immorality
she
would
read
it
over
again
and
again
and
everything
else
this
man
had
written
it
seemed
that
she
was
newly
awakened
to
a
sense
of
power
that
she
had
not
known
she
possessed
if
only
she
could
have
read
this
before
she
had
gone
to
paris
what
a
help
it
would
have
been
so
algy
was
not
so
ignorant
after
all
she
mused
of
course
he
must
have
thought
i
was
and
so
did
not
let
me
see
that
he
himself
was
more
than
a
fool
darling
algy
but
at
all
events
he
had
thought
she
was
like
only
kinder
that
was
good
enough
well
she
would
make
that
true
some
day
and
meanwhile
she
was
away
from
stultifying
squalor
away
from
minds
only
interested
in
petty
local
affairs
away
from
sham
gentility
away
from
gramophones
and
cinemas
away
from
pretence
away
among
the
real
things
where
she
could
learn
to
understand
every
shade
of
the
meaning
of
life
step
by
step
and
at
this
stage
of
her
musings
after
a
gentle
knock
the
same
housemaid
opened
the
door
with
a
can
of
hot
water
your
dinner
will
be
served
in
the
secretary
room
at
eight
miss
it
is
seven
now
when
would
you
like
me
to
return
to
fasten
you
up
the
two
red
spots
appeared
in
katherine
bush
cheeks
so
she
had
been
expected
to
change
her
dress
and
she
had
not
thought
of
doing
so
she
had
not
even
imagined
that
she
would
go
again
downstairs
or
have
any
dinner
after
that
wonderful
tea
a
little
supper
probably
on
a
tray
later
on
or
something
like
that
but
here
was
dinner
perhaps
the
same
kind
of
meal
as
she
had
had
with
lord
algy
of
course
she
ought
to
have
known
that
she
must
change
her
dress
she
felt
very
angry
with
herself
and
after
the
exaltation
over
her
own
instincts
this
was
a
fall
but
she
would
never
err
again
and
fortunately
the
housemaid
would
not
know
that
she
had
been
ignorant
my
things
fasten
in
the
front
thank
you
so
that
i
need
not
trouble
you
she
answered
graciously
but
will
you
tell
me
please
where
i
shall
find
the
secretary
room
the
housemaid
gave
directions
but
one
of
the
footmen
would
be
certain
to
be
in
the
hall
and
would
show
her
thomas
the
one
who
had
brought
her
up
would
wait
on
her
when
you
are
ready
miss
will
you
please
ring
and
i
will
whistle
down
to
say
you
are
coming
we
always
did
for
miss
arnott
and
then
they
serve
the
dinner
at
once
this
bell
rings
up
and
this
one
down
it
is
the
upstairs
one
for
me
i
am
martha
the
second
housemaid
miss
and
will
be
pleased
to
do
anything
i
can
for
you
katherine
bush
thanked
the
girl
again
and
quickly
began
to
dress
and
at
a
minute
or
two
to
eight
was
on
her
way
this
upper
staircase
she
found
descended
to
the
ground
floor
independently
of
the
stately
shallow
marble
one
she
had
walked
up
on
to
the
on
her
former
visit
and
which
went
no
farther
than
the
first
floor
thomas
was
waiting
for
her
and
conducted
her
to
a
room
down
the
corridor
whose
windows
she
discovered
later
looked
out
on
a
dull
blank
wall
it
had
comfortable
solid
furniture
the
relic
possibly
of
some
country
and
faded
crimson
silk
brocade
curtains
the
discarded
splendour
of
a
salon
perhaps
these
were
cosily
drawn
and
there
was
plenty
of
electric
light
and
she
saw
that
there
would
be
space
to
do
her
typing
on
the
solid
large
table
and
to
keep
all
records
in
those
capacious
cupboards
which
lined
the
walls
the
feeling
that
she
was
in
space
again
gave
her
satisfaction
she
had
so
often
longed
to
break
down
the
partition
of
her
attic
or
stretch
out
and
push
away
the
glass
screen
at
liv
and
dev
the
room
was
very
high
too
another
advantage
i
shall
always
have
large
high
rooms
when
i
have
won
my
game
she
said
to
herself
a
small
table
by
the
fire
was
laid
for
one
she
made
herself
notice
the
silver
and
the
glass
and
the
cloth
and
almost
immediately
thomas
brought
in
a
large
tray
with
her
dinner
there
was
soup
in
a
quaint
covered
cup
with
two
handles
and
some
hot
silver
dishes
he
placed
them
all
with
regularity
within
her
reach
and
then
asked
respectfully
if
she
would
please
to
ring
when
she
was
ready
for
her
sweet
miss
arnott
was
wont
to
take
claret
he
informed
her
but
what
would
she
miss
bush
desire
to
drink
a
cup
of
tea
almost
escaped
from
the
tip
of
katherine
tongue
but
she
stopped
herself
probably
one
did
not
take
tea
with
one
dinner
even
alone
like
this
and
if
she
had
it
thomas
would
know
that
she
was
not
accustomed
to
the
regulation
things
water
would
be
safest
so
she
indicated
her
wishes
and
thomas
left
the
room
a
sense
of
strangeness
almost
of
awe
stole
over
her
a
sensation
she
had
not
felt
even
when
with
lord
algy
in
the
gilded
luxury
of
the
paris
hotel
she
had
known
then
that
those
surroundings
were
just
part
of
any
life
and
could
be
had
by
the
lowest
for
money
but
these
were
quite
different
these
were
rather
shabby
but
were
the
expression
of
people
who
had
had
them
for
countless
years
and
were
of
course
ordinary
and
everyday
in
their
existences
the
whole
atmosphere
affected
her
she
was
glad
that
thomas
had
gone
out
of
the
room
she
knew
that
at
the
present
stage
she
should
hate
to
be
watched
while
she
ate
by
a
silent
servant
but
i
must
accustom
myself
to
that
she
told
herself
for
algy
she
remembered
had
never
seemed
to
remark
servants
at
all
and
would
go
on
talking
to
her
while
his
coat
was
being
handed
or
his
boots
put
on
as
though
hanson
did
not
exist
she
was
hungry
and
began
to
break
her
bread
she
wished
she
felt
quite
sure
whether
or
no
she
was
expected
to
turn
the
soup
out
into
the
soup
plate
or
drink
it
as
it
was
she
decided
to
try
the
former
course
since
of
what
use
was
the
soup
plate
if
it
had
not
been
brought
for
that
purpose
the
food
proved
to
be
excellent
and
the
sweet
and
fruit
just
to
her
taste
and
when
all
was
finished
thomas
removed
everything
and
folded
up
the
small
table
and
put
it
back
into
its
evidently
accustomed
corner
and
bringing
her
the
evening
papers
he
made
up
the
fire
and
left
her
alone
this
she
supposed
would
be
the
time
she
would
have
to
herself
she
hardly
noticed
the
headlines
as
she
glanced
at
the
news
her
mind
was
too
full
of
herself
and
her
new
life
to
take
interest
in
outside
things
where
did
that
door
lead
to
she
wondered
a
heavy
mahogany
door
but
she
was
soon
to
know
for
it
opened
suddenly
and
the
man
she
had
already
twice
seen
came
in
leaving
it
open
after
him
so
that
she
could
perceive
that
the
room
he
had
left
was
a
dim
vast
library
it
was
lined
with
books
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
i
have
come
for
some
paper
my
aunt
used
to
have
it
kept
in
this
drawer
i
think
katherine
bush
rose
while
he
went
to
get
it
out
for
himself
he
was
not
her
employer
and
she
did
not
yet
know
where
things
were
kept
so
she
did
not
offer
to
help
him
he
was
in
evening
dress
and
his
hair
was
as
well
groomed
as
lord
algy
but
not
cut
quite
so
short
and
it
was
brushed
straight
back
from
his
forehead
and
was
brown
and
thick
his
face
was
tired
and
humorous
and
very
distinguished
but
for
the
moment
he
looked
cross
and
impatient
the
paper
was
evidently
not
where
he
had
thought
that
it
would
be
confound
it
he
muttered
almost
inaudibly
and
then
aloud
i
am
in
a
great
hurry
will
you
please
look
in
those
cupboards
while
i
look
in
these
katherine
bush
did
as
she
was
asked
and
chanced
upon
the
paper
immediately
she
handed
it
to
him
without
a
word
she
noticed
that
he
hardly
looked
at
her
and
did
not
take
in
her
personality
at
all
she
was
just
his
aunt
new
secretary
and
typist
and
more
important
matters
pressed
thanks
awfully
then
he
glanced
at
the
table
where
the
typing
machine
used
by
miss
arnott
stood
oh
er
i
was
wondering
if
you
would
be
so
awfully
kind
as
to
type
this
when
i
have
written
it
it
is
a
letter
i
must
send
to
the
and
i
shall
have
to
go
in
to
dinner
in
a
minute
i
have
not
seen
how
this
machine
works
yet
katherine
bush
answered
but
if
you
care
to
dictate
i
can
take
it
down
in
shorthand
and
then
write
it
out
very
quickly
afterwards
that
is
most
kind
of
you
will
you
come
into
the
library
then
my
notes
are
there
she
followed
him
silently
and
when
he
had
found
some
scribbled
words
written
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
he
went
to
the
and
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
began
to
speak
katherine
had
taken
up
a
block
and
pencil
and
was
waiting
ready
he
was
not
coherent
at
first
he
had
neither
livingstone
precise
oily
slowness
nor
devereux
crisp
fluency
she
took
down
exactly
what
he
had
said
then
he
asked
her
to
read
it
aloud
that
is
frightful
english
he
exclaimed
impatiently
i
never
can
dictate
properly
i
must
always
write
myself
or
my
ideas
do
not
flow
if
the
substance
is
all
right
and
it
is
just
the
english
you
want
regulated
i
can
do
that
when
i
copy
it
out
he
looked
at
her
in
doubt
and
katherine
smiled
to
herself
this
flattered
her
it
would
be
awfully
kind
of
you
if
you
would
though
he
went
on
hesitatingly
i
have
kept
them
waiting
a
quarter
of
an
hour
as
it
is
could
you
do
it
immediately
and
send
it
in
to
the
by
one
of
the
footmen
i
have
my
with
me
i
will
sign
it
there
it
is
to
be
addressed
to
the
editor
of
the
yes
i
will
strobridge
thanked
his
aunt
new
secretary
courteously
as
he
went
towards
the
door
and
then
he
left
the
room
at
the
moment
of
his
exit
katherine
bush
heard
the
sound
of
voices
male
and
female
they
were
evidently
going
in
to
dinner
without
waiting
for
him
she
looked
up
at
the
clock
it
was
ten
minutes
to
nine
then
she
smiled
again
and
going
to
the
she
began
her
task
a
very
simple
one
to
her
who
was
accustomed
to
frame
euphonious
sentences
and
when
she
had
completed
it
she
went
back
into
the
secretary
room
and
rang
the
bell
this
is
to
be
taken
to
is
his
name
strobridge
lady
garribardine
nephew
she
told
the
astonished
thomas
yes
miss
nephew
is
gerard
strobridge
if
you
mean
him
yes
i
do
he
is
dining
here
and
wants
it
at
once
she
made
no
further
explanation
but
took
up
the
paper
and
reseated
herself
in
her
chair
by
the
fire
and
thomas
could
but
obey
orders
a
cool
card
he
whistled
to
himself
as
he
disappeared
meanwhile
gerard
strobridge
was
saying
to
the
lady
at
his
side
i
had
to
repudiate
warrington
insolence
in
the
i
have
written
to
the
that
is
what
made
me
keep
even
you
waiting
dearest
lady
my
aunt
new
shorthand
typist
took
it
down
and
i
shall
send
it
off
in
a
few
minutes
i
hope
it
will
not
be
too
late
you
look
quite
serious
the
lady
laughed
it
is
too
attractive
to
see
you
in
earnest
over
something
i
am
always
in
earnest
especially
when
i
tell
you
that
i
love
you
why
did
you
not
come
this
afternoon
l√§o
i
stayed
late
on
purpose
and
you
never
turned
up
i
knew
i
should
meet
you
and
i
do
not
want
soon
to
grow
bored
strobridge
looked
at
her
reproachfully
she
was
extremely
pleasant
to
the
eye
with
her
marvellous
skin
and
dark
hair
and
her
curly
affected
mouth
he
was
a
cynic
and
an
epicurean
he
was
not
in
the
least
disenchanted
by
his
knowledge
that
the
whole
woman
was
a
mass
of
affectation
from
the
conscious
pouting
of
her
red
lips
to
the
way
she
held
her
soup
spoon
he
rather
admired
the
skill
she
showed
in
it
all
she
pleased
his
senses
had
just
enough
wit
to
chirp
like
a
parrot
good
things
others
had
said
and
was
full
of
small
talk
while
she
knew
the
game
to
her
he
did
not
want
the
repetition
of
a
serious
affair
since
he
had
so
happily
escaped
by
the
skin
of
his
teeth
from
alice
southerwood
l√§o
delemar
widowed
and
rich
and
circumspect
promised
an
agreeable
winter
to
him
with
few
complications
women
were
more
or
less
necessities
to
gerard
strobridge
life
they
were
his
choruses
his
solaces
his
inspirations
in
a
few
minutes
a
footman
brought
the
large
envelope
and
amidst
general
chaff
he
read
aloud
the
letter
his
astonishment
momentarily
growing
at
the
apt
rearrangement
of
his
words
she
is
no
fool
your
new
secretary
seraphim
he
called
down
the
table
to
his
aunt
i
do
thank
you
for
her
services
sarah
lady
garribardine
laughed
complacently
i
told
you
i
had
found
a
treasure
in
miss
katherine
bush
chapter
vii
over
a
week
had
gone
by
and
katherine
bush
had
completely
fallen
into
her
duties
they
were
not
difficult
and
she
continued
to
keep
her
eyes
and
her
intelligence
on
the
alert
and
by
the
second
sunday
when
she
was
to
have
the
afternoon
to
meet
matilda
she
had
begun
to
feel
that
a
whole
ocean
had
rolled
between
the
present
katherine
and
the
creature
of
the
days
before
the
outing
in
paris
with
lord
algy
she
had
made
one
or
two
annoying
mistakes
and
had
had
one
or
two
surprises
some
pleasant
ones
it
was
agreeable
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
when
one
woke
and
one
curtains
drawn
back
by
an
attentive
housemaid
every
morning
and
a
deep
hot
bath
instead
of
a
scramble
in
a
small
tin
tub
on
saturday
nights
there
was
a
bathroom
in
laburnum
villa
but
during
the
week
matilda
used
it
for
keeping
all
sorts
of
things
in
and
there
were
such
a
number
of
them
to
have
the
bath
in
turns
on
saturday
and
sunday
that
katherine
had
preferred
the
indifferent
comfort
of
a
makeshift
in
her
own
attic
it
seemed
on
looking
back
after
ten
days
of
modest
luxury
that
it
never
could
have
been
possible
that
she
had
gone
on
month
after
month
and
year
after
year
in
the
family
circle
her
heart
swelled
with
gratitude
to
lord
algy
but
for
him
she
might
never
have
known
that
there
was
anything
different
at
these
moments
she
knew
that
she
could
easily
slip
into
sentiment
about
him
again
and
so
she
invariably
crushed
her
emotion
and
began
some
active
work
at
nine
in
the
morning
it
was
her
duty
to
go
to
lady
garribardine
in
her
bedroom
where
she
would
find
her
propped
up
upon
lacy
pink
silk
pillows
a
saucy
cap
and
ribbons
covering
the
greater
part
of
a
more
coquettish
and
rather
lighter
golden
wig
than
the
one
she
wore
in
the
day
her
face
had
not
yet
been
arranged
and
presented
a
sad
contrast
to
these
youthful
allurements
her
temper
was
often
very
precarious
katherine
stood
by
the
bed
block
in
hand
and
took
down
all
instructions
lady
garribardine
voluminous
correspondence
was
only
attended
to
in
the
morning
the
accumulations
of
the
later
part
of
the
day
before
were
heaped
up
in
one
basket
tray
and
the
early
posts
in
another
while
a
third
empty
one
awaited
those
communications
which
were
to
be
answered
either
in
type
or
in
handwriting
now
after
ten
days
of
service
katherine
had
mastered
most
of
lady
garribardine
affairs
she
knew
the
wages
of
her
servants
the
expenditure
of
the
house
the
phrasing
of
her
friends
letters
their
points
of
views
little
hatreds
and
little
loves
their
want
or
possession
of
good
english
and
powers
of
expressing
themselves
she
fancied
she
could
almost
picture
the
faces
so
vivid
were
these
pen
portraits
of
the
writers
that
the
notes
showed
lady
garribardine
seldom
answered
even
the
most
private
with
her
own
hand
and
katherine
had
grown
quite
accustomed
to
signing
sarah
garribardine
as
yours
affectionately
or
yours
sincerely
she
even
derived
a
cynical
amusement
from
the
fictions
she
was
instructed
to
invent
to
one
and
another
the
life
of
a
great
lady
she
saw
would
be
a
very
complicated
affair
to
a
novice
and
each
day
she
felt
glad
she
was
having
the
opportunity
of
learning
its
intricacies
she
meant
to
make
no
mistakes
when
her
own
turn
should
come
lady
garribardine
had
not
continued
to
exploit
her
for
her
personal
diversion
as
she
had
done
on
the
occasion
of
their
initial
meeting
she
had
been
too
occupied
perhaps
on
the
contrary
she
kept
strictly
to
her
r√¥le
of
employer
and
hardly
spoke
except
on
business
katherine
realised
that
she
looked
upon
her
much
as
lord
algy
had
looked
upon
hanson
and
far
from
its
arousing
the
rageful
resentment
which
it
would
have
done
in
matilda
feminine
breast
she
saw
the
justice
of
it
and
considered
it
a
proper
arrangement
some
people
have
the
luck
to
be
born
to
high
station
she
reasoned
to
herself
and
those
who
would
attain
it
for
themselves
must
make
themselves
fitted
for
it
first
besides
there
would
be
no
good
in
it
to
me
if
after
i
had
obtained
it
i
should
have
to
hobnob
with
my
own
secretary
it
is
the
distinctions
and
barriers
that
make
the
thing
worth
having
as
yet
she
had
only
rarely
come
across
other
members
of
the
world
beyond
her
employer
on
such
occasions
as
for
instance
if
she
were
sent
for
suddenly
to
the
to
take
down
some
instruction
or
bring
some
charity
list
but
whenever
she
had
the
chance
she
observed
them
carefully
some
of
them
were
far
from
what
had
been
her
ideal
of
what
high
birth
and
breeding
would
certainly
show
but
they
all
had
that
ease
of
manner
which
polished
their
casualnesses
and
once
she
was
still
receiving
instructions
by
the
bedside
when
stirling
the
maid
came
to
know
if
lady
beatrice
strobridge
might
come
up
confound
the
woman
her
ladyship
exclaimed
in
her
angelic
voice
its
refinement
of
pronunciation
always
a
joy
to
katherine
ear
whatever
the
bluntness
of
the
words
might
be
no
certainly
not
my
face
is
not
done
but
stay
stirling
it
may
be
something
to
do
with
give
me
the
rouge
and
powder
and
a
do
go
miss
bush
it
is
nothing
private
and
she
wo
stay
for
more
than
a
minute
katherine
discreetly
turned
her
eyes
from
the
bed
to
the
window
and
when
she
looked
round
again
two
blooming
cheeks
balanced
the
girlish
curls
and
lady
garribardine
was
reposing
languidly
upon
her
pillows
dearest
aunt
sarah
i
had
to
come
cried
lady
beatrice
in
her
plaintive
discontented
voice
gerard
has
been
perfectly
impossible
actually
has
refused
to
let
me
go
to
the
artist
model
ball
as
ganymede
and
i
have
got
the
most
ducky
dress
a
pendant
to
hebe
vermont
iris
a
few
rags
of
chiffon
a
cup
and
bare
legs
i
suppose
lady
garribardine
retorted
not
unkindly
as
her
niece
sat
upon
the
bed
you
may
describe
it
like
that
if
you
want
to
aunt
sarah
i
assure
you
though
it
is
most
becoming
and
it
is
too
ridiculous
when
everyone
we
know
is
going
and
all
the
thorvils
have
such
tiny
ankles
too
the
more
reason
for
you
not
to
expose
them
to
the
common
herd
go
naked
if
you
so
desire
to
a
ball
in
a
private
house
among
your
own
class
you
lay
yourself
open
only
to
criticisms
of
your
charms
there
but
to
let
hoi
polloi
gaze
at
you
undressed
is
to
lower
your
order
i
am
with
gerard
about
that
lady
beatrice
pouted
i
really
thought
you
were
so
up
to
date
aunt
seraphim
darling
that
you
would
be
sure
to
side
with
me
of
course
i
shall
go
all
the
same
i
should
not
think
of
paying
any
attention
to
gerard
only
it
would
be
so
much
nicer
if
you
had
consented
to
scold
him
for
me
i
am
up
to
date
i
hope
in
so
far
as
i
try
to
move
with
the
times
lady
garribardine
face
was
contemptuous
only
i
consider
that
all
of
you
who
throw
your
bonnets
over
the
windmills
are
cutting
your
own
throats
you
are
destroying
values
cheapening
pleasures
breaking
down
hedges
and
letting
in
the
swine
to
feed
upon
your
grapes
you
are
often
very
vulgar
you
modern
people
lady
beatrice
got
off
the
bed
then
there
is
no
use
talking
aunt
sarah
i
dare
say
we
are
but
what
matter
i
wish
i
knew
what
matter
i
am
bored
all
the
time
i
get
some
momentary
pleasure
out
of
my
poetry
and
some
out
of
my
dear
precious
friends
but
the
rest
of
the
day
is
one
long
yawn
you
ought
not
to
grudge
my
being
ganymede
every
sort
of
quaint
creature
is
at
this
ball
and
i
get
quite
amused
each
year
when
i
go
why
do
you
take
a
box
then
and
watch
them
i
could
quite
understand
that
and
intend
to
do
so
myself
miss
bush
by
the
way
did
you
write
to
say
i
would
have
number
five
katherine
replied
in
the
affirmative
and
lady
beatrice
suddenly
became
aware
of
her
presence
as
she
resumed
her
place
on
the
bed
oh
this
is
your
new
secretary
aunt
sarah
i
am
sure
you
have
a
frightfully
difficult
time
er
miss
bush
and
she
laughed
her
ladyship
expects
perfection
her
ladyship
has
quite
a
right
to
as
good
as
can
be
got
since
she
pays
for
it
katherine
voice
was
deep
and
level
and
contained
no
impertinence
only
a
grave
statement
of
fact
lady
garribardine
chuckled
among
her
pillows
miss
bush
is
much
nearer
the
truth
of
things
than
any
of
you
psychological
philosophers
bee
analysing
matters
with
little
dilettante
methods
all
day
to
the
laughter
of
the
gods
miss
bush
realises
her
obligations
as
a
secretary
but
you
very
often
perceive
yours
as
a
duke
daughter
and
a
rising
foreign
office
official
wife
lady
beatrice
was
not
the
least
crushed
she
laughed
frankly
dear
sweet
aunty
there
never
has
been
a
scandel
about
me
in
my
life
i
am
a
model
of
circumspectness
demureness
and
virtuous
wifeliness
why
i
never
interfere
with
gerard
we
hardly
meet
in
the
whole
week
and
i
merely
like
my
own
simple
friends
my
own
simple
clothes
and
my
own
simple
pleasures
artless
creature
and
the
youthful
curls
shook
well
what
did
you
come
for
in
so
many
words
to
try
to
get
me
to
influence
gerard
not
to
play
for
once
the
ineffectual
part
of
husband
in
authority
and
so
let
you
disgrace
the
name
of
thorvil
and
strobridge
in
peace
lady
beatrice
seized
and
stroked
the
fat
hand
lying
upon
the
pink
silk
coverlet
you
darling
ducky
aunt
seraphim
just
that
i
want
to
wear
my
enchanting
boy
dress
i
must
be
ganymede
the
cupbearer
well
i
be
no
party
to
it
be
off
with
you
i
have
serious
affairs
to
settle
with
miss
bush
and
have
no
further
time
to
waste
lady
beatrice
saluted
her
obediently
and
got
off
the
bed
once
more
she
was
laughing
softly
gerard
is
coming
to
lunch
lady
garribardine
called
to
her
and
l√§o
delemar
and
they
are
going
to
see
a
winter
exhibition
afterwards
i
ca
stand
l√§o
lady
beatrice
cooed
from
the
doorway
she
pretends
to
be
so
full
of
sex
and
other
dreadful
natural
things
she
makes
my
innocent
aesthetic
flesh
creep
gerard
always
had
fruity
tastes
dear
aunt
sarah
and
kissing
her
she
was
at
last
gone
leaving
katherine
wondering
they
had
said
very
severe
things
to
each
other
and
neither
was
the
least
angry
really
gladys
and
fred
were
not
wont
to
bicker
so
call
up
strobridge
miss
bush
he
will
not
have
left
home
yet
you
know
his
number
ask
him
to
speak
to
me
at
once
katherine
obeyed
she
was
an
expert
with
the
telephone
and
never
raised
her
voice
strobridge
was
soon
at
the
other
end
of
it
and
she
was
about
to
hand
the
receiver
to
her
employer
when
that
lady
frowned
and
told
her
to
give
the
message
herself
my
right
ear
is
troublesome
she
said
you
must
do
the
business
for
me
miss
bush
hello
her
ladyship
wishes
me
to
give
you
a
message
will
you
wait
a
moment
until
i
take
it
hello
yes
say
he
is
to
come
half
an
hour
earlier
to
lunch
i
have
things
to
talk
over
with
him
about
he
is
to
go
to
this
ridiculous
ball
in
my
box
tell
him
so
katherine
repeated
the
exact
message
tell
her
i
am
very
much
annoyed
about
the
whole
thing
strobridge
returned
and
have
decided
not
to
be
present
myself
stuff
and
nonsense
cried
lady
garribardine
when
she
was
told
and
seizing
the
receiver
from
katherine
hand
she
roared
do
be
a
fool
it
is
too
late
in
the
day
to
stand
upon
your
dignity
i
tell
you
the
rest
when
you
come
to
lunch
upon
which
she
closed
the
communication
and
called
for
stirling
take
all
this
rubbish
of
letters
away
miss
bush
i
must
get
up
and
cope
with
the
humiliating
defects
of
old
age
you
may
go
katherine
had
a
very
busy
morning
in
front
of
her
she
sat
steadily
typing
and
writing
in
the
secretary
room
until
her
lunch
was
brought
and
even
then
she
hardly
stopped
to
eat
it
but
on
her
own
way
to
the
lady
garribardine
came
in
she
looked
at
the
hardly
tasted
food
and
blinked
her
black
eyes
tut
tut
you
must
eat
child
trop
de
finish
your
pudding
and
then
bring
me
those
two
letters
upon
the
report
of
the
wineberger
charity
into
the
you
can
have
your
coffee
with
us
strobridge
and
i
are
alone
delemar
is
not
coming
after
all
by
the
way
do
you
have
everything
you
want
the
coffee
they
give
you
is
good
eh
servants
always
skimp
the
beans
when
left
to
themselves
i
have
everything
i
want
thank
you
but
i
have
not
been
offered
coffee
katherine
replied
lady
garribardine
face
assumed
an
indignant
expression
and
she
sharply
rang
the
bell
these
are
the
things
that
happen
when
one
does
not
know
of
them
you
ought
to
have
complained
to
me
before
miss
bush
thomas
answered
the
bell
and
whitened
perceptibly
when
he
saw
his
mistress
face
he
was
asked
why
miss
bush
had
not
been
served
with
coffee
in
a
voice
which
froze
his
tongue
and
the
only
excuse
he
could
give
was
a
stammering
statement
that
miss
arnott
had
not
taken
any
which
aroused
further
wrath
pampered
wretches
lady
garribardine
exclaimed
anything
to
save
themselves
trouble
i
will
speak
to
bronson
about
this
but
see
that
it
never
happens
again
thomas
and
the
trembling
footman
was
allowed
to
leave
the
room
i
am
glad
you
did
not
try
to
defend
them
as
the
foolish
arnott
would
have
done
her
ladyship
flashed
she
was
always
standing
between
my
just
wrath
and
the
servant
delinquencies
always
shielding
them
one
would
have
thought
she
was
of
their
class
the
result
was
no
one
in
the
house
respected
her
good
creature
though
she
was
see
that
you
are
respected
young
woman
and
obeyed
when
obedience
is
your
due
i
will
try
to
be
and
an
inscrutable
expression
played
round
katherine
full
red
mouth
i
would
never
shield
anyone
from
what
he
deserved
it
seems
to
me
you
understand
a
good
deal
girl
well
come
into
the
in
half
an
hour
and
smiling
her
comprehending
smile
lady
garribardine
left
the
room
that
is
a
wonderful
creature
that
new
secretary
of
mine
have
you
noticed
her
yet
she
said
later
on
to
her
nephew
when
they
had
finished
the
serious
part
of
their
luncheon
and
she
had
rung
her
enamelled
bell
for
the
automatic
entrance
of
the
servants
from
behind
the
screen
they
were
only
allowed
in
the
room
to
change
the
courses
at
this
meal
numbers
of
politicians
and
diplomats
frequently
dropped
in
and
preferred
to
discuss
affairs
with
their
hostess
alone
no
not
much
strobridge
admitted
when
they
were
again
by
themselves
and
coffee
had
come
i
thought
she
did
my
letter
to
the
remarkably
well
though
she
has
not
done
anything
badly
yet
when
she
makes
a
mistake
in
social
trifles
she
always
realises
it
and
corrects
herself
her
reading
aloud
was
grotesque
at
first
but
i
have
never
had
to
tell
her
how
to
pronounce
a
word
twice
i
lay
traps
for
her
she
is
as
smart
as
paint
and
as
deep
as
a
well
a
treasure
indeed
but
strobridge
voice
was
absent
he
was
uninterested
and
was
still
smarting
under
the
annoyance
of
the
situation
created
by
his
wife
of
course
he
could
not
make
her
stay
at
home
by
force
and
he
hated
the
idea
of
ganymede
and
the
bare
legs
he
reverted
to
the
topic
once
more
i
would
really
rather
not
go
to
see
the
freakish
crew
he
said
beatrice
is
doing
it
merely
from
obstinacy
she
is
not
like
hebe
vermont
a
ridiculous
crazy
for
notoriety
she
is
a
refined
creature
generally
though
wearying
this
is
just
to
defy
me
as
i
have
always
told
you
you
should
never
have
married
you
are
made
for
an
ardent
and
devoted
lover
with
a
suitable
change
of
inamorata
every
six
months
in
the
r√¥le
of
husband
you
are
frankly
a
little
ridiculous
you
have
no
authority
as
miss
bush
put
it
just
now
about
something
else
you
usually
act
from
good
nature
not
from
a
sense
of
justice
and
beatrice
snaps
her
fingers
at
you
and
goes
her
own
way
i
do
mind
as
a
rule
indeed
i
am
grateful
to
her
for
doing
so
can
there
be
anything
more
tedious
and
bourgeois
than
the
recognised
relation
of
husband
and
wife
the
only
things
which
make
intimacy
with
a
woman
agreeable
are
difficulty
and
intermittency
bee
fortunately
expects
nothing
from
me
and
i
expect
nothing
from
her
beyond
acting
in
a
manner
suitable
to
her
race
and
station
and
i
do
think
ganymede
in
his
original
costume
at
an
artist
models
ball
a
harmonious
part
for
my
wife
or
a
thorvil
to
adopt
you
do
know
how
to
manage
her
and
you
are
too
indifferent
to
try
so
you
had
better
swallow
your
outraged
dignity
and
come
with
me
in
my
box
after
all
l√§o
will
be
there
and
you
can
sit
and
whisper
in
the
back
of
it
and
lady
garribardine
lit
her
cigarette
but
strobridge
protested
in
whimsical
distress
heaven
forbid
would
you
kill
this
dawning
romance
seraphim
if
l√§o
and
i
are
to
be
drafted
off
like
a
pair
of
fianc√©s
the
whole
charm
is
gone
i
wish
to
my
emotions
so
that
they
may
last
over
the
easter
recess
after
that
i
shall
be
too
busy
for
them
to
matter
be
ruthless
sweet
aunt
lady
garribardine
laughed
and
at
that
moment
katherine
bush
came
in
the
finished
letters
in
her
hand
give
miss
bush
some
coffee
while
i
look
over
them
and
her
ladyship
indicated
the
tray
which
had
been
placed
by
an
attentive
bronson
close
to
her
hand
strobridge
did
as
he
was
asked
his
thoughts
were
far
away
and
beyond
displaying
the
courtesy
he
used
to
all
women
he
never
noticed
katherine
at
all
she
was
quite
ordinary
looking
still
with
the
screwed
up
mop
of
hair
and
her
plain
dark
blouse
unless
you
chanced
to
meet
her
strange
and
beautiful
eyes
for
some
reason
she
felt
a
little
piqued
the
man
manner
and
phrasing
attracted
her
his
voice
was
superlatively
cultivated
and
his
words
chosen
with
polished
grace
here
was
a
person
from
whom
something
could
be
learned
she
would
have
wished
to
have
talked
with
him
unrestrainedly
and
alone
she
remained
silent
and
listened
when
aunt
and
nephew
again
took
up
the
ball
of
conversation
together
how
she
would
love
to
be
able
to
converse
like
that
they
were
so
sparkling
never
in
earnest
seemingly
all
was
light
as
air
while
strobridge
made
allusions
and
quotations
which
showed
his
brilliant
erudition
and
katherine
hearkened
with
all
her
ears
some
of
them
she
recognized
and
others
she
determined
to
look
up
but
his
whole
pronunciation
of
the
sentences
sounded
different
from
what
she
had
imagined
they
would
be
when
she
had
read
them
to
herself
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
heard
a
continued
conversation
between
two
people
who
she
had
already
decided
were
worthy
of
note
and
this
stood
out
as
the
first
milestone
in
her
progress
presently
they
all
rose
and
she
went
back
to
her
work
with
the
sense
of
the
magnitude
of
her
task
in
climbing
to
the
pinnacle
of
a
great
lady
and
cultivated
woman
of
the
world
for
a
few
moments
she
felt
a
little
depressed
then
a
thought
came
to
her
he
could
help
me
to
knowledge
of
literature
and
art
he
could
teach
me
true
culture
and
since
he
is
married
there
can
be
no
stupid
but
for
this
he
must
first
realise
that
i
exist
and
for
that
when
my
chance
comes
i
must
arrest
his
attention
through
the
ears
and
the
eyes
he
must
for
once
look
at
me
and
see
not
only
his
secretary
and
then
i
can
learn
from
him
all
that
i
desire
to
know
that
this
course
of
action
could
possibly
cause
the
proposed
teacher
pain
in
the
future
never
entered
her
head
chapter
viii
matilda
had
been
told
to
meet
her
sister
if
it
should
be
fine
on
this
sunday
in
the
park
by
the
serpentine
they
would
walk
about
and
then
go
and
have
an
early
tea
at
victoria
station
whence
matilda
could
take
a
train
back
to
bindon
green
they
met
punctually
at
the
time
appointed
on
the
bridge
and
the
elder
miss
bush
was
filled
with
joy
she
had
missed
katherine
dreadfully
as
browbeating
husbands
are
often
missed
by
meek
wives
and
she
was
full
of
curiosity
to
hear
her
news
you
look
changed
somehow
kitten
she
exclaimed
when
they
had
greeted
each
other
it
is
because
you
done
your
hair
differently
you
had
it
that
way
on
the
last
day
it
is
a
bit
look
but
it
suits
you
no
it
not
that
but
you
are
changed
somehow
now
tell
me
everything
dearie
i
am
dying
to
hear
i
like
it
began
katherine
and
i
am
learning
lots
of
things
this
information
did
not
thrill
matilda
katherine
desire
to
be
always
learning
was
very
fatiguing
she
thought
and
quite
unnecessary
she
wanted
to
hear
facts
of
food
and
lodging
and
people
and
treatment
not
unimportant
moral
developments
oh
well
she
said
are
they
kind
to
you
yes
i
am
waited
on
like
a
lady
and
generally
the
work
is
half
so
heavy
as
at
liv
and
dev
tell
me
right
from
the
beginning
what
you
do
when
you
get
up
in
the
morning
until
you
go
to
bed
katherine
complied
i
am
waked
at
seven
and
given
a
cup
of
tea
real
tea
tild
not
the
stuff
we
called
tea
at
home
a
slight
toss
of
the
head
from
matilda
the
second
housemaid
waits
on
me
and
pulls
up
my
blind
and
then
i
have
my
bath
in
the
bathroom
across
the
passage
a
nice
deep
hot
bath
whatever
for
every
day
interrupted
matilda
what
waste
of
soap
and
towels
and
things
do
you
like
it
kitten
of
course
i
do
we
all
seem
to
be
very
dirty
people
to
me
now
tild
with
our
one
tub
a
week
you
soon
grow
to
find
things
a
necessity
i
could
not
bear
not
to
have
a
bath
every
day
now
matilda
snorted
well
and
then
then
i
go
down
and
have
my
breakfast
in
the
secretary
room
my
in
fact
it
is
a
lovely
breakfast
with
beautiful
china
and
silver
and
and
when
i
have
finished
that
i
take
my
block
and
pencil
and
go
up
to
lady
garribardine
bedroom
to
take
down
my
instructions
for
the
day
in
shorthand
oh
kitten
do
tell
me
what
her
room
like
at
last
something
interesting
might
be
coming
it
is
all
pink
silk
and
lace
and
a
gilt
bed
and
numbers
of
photographs
and
a
big
sofa
and
comfortable
chairs
and
when
she
has
rheumatism
she
stays
there
and
has
people
up
to
tea
what
folks
to
tea
in
her
bedroom
ladies
of
course
oh
dear
no
men
too
she
has
heaps
of
men
friends
they
are
devoted
to
her
gentlemen
in
her
bedroom
i
do
call
that
fast
matilda
was
frankly
shocked
why
asked
katherine
why
my
dear
just
fancy
gentlemen
where
you
sleep
and
dress
mabel
would
not
dream
of
doing
such
a
thing
and
i
do
hope
she
never
hear
you
are
in
that
kind
of
a
house
she
be
sure
to
pass
remarks
lady
garribardine
is
over
sixty
years
old
tild
do
you
think
you
are
being
rather
funny
and
katherine
wondered
why
she
had
never
noticed
before
that
matilda
was
totally
devoid
of
all
sense
of
humour
and
then
she
realised
that
the
conception
was
new
even
to
herself
and
must
have
come
from
her
book
reading
though
she
was
conscious
that
it
was
a
gift
that
she
had
always
enjoyed
no
one
had
spoken
of
the
senses
of
humour
in
their
home
circle
and
matilda
would
not
have
understood
what
it
meant
or
whether
she
did
or
did
not
possess
it
things
were
things
to
matilda
and
had
not
different
aspects
and
for
a
lady
to
receive
gentlemen
in
her
bedroom
if
she
were
even
over
sixty
years
old
and
suffering
from
rheumatism
was
not
proper
conduct
and
would
earn
the
disapproval
of
mabel
cawber
and
indeed
of
refined
and
select
bindon
green
in
general
i
do
see
that
age
makes
a
difference
it
the
idea
of
tea
in
a
bedroom
dearie
with
gentlemen
but
what
do
you
think
they
would
do
to
her
tild
katherine
with
difficulty
hid
her
smile
oh
my
what
dreadful
things
you
do
say
katherine
matilda
blushed
why
it
the
awkwardness
of
it
for
them
i
wondering
whatever
fred
and
bert
and
charlie
prodgers
would
feel
if
mabel
had
them
up
to
hers
of
a
sunday
supposing
she
had
a
cold
and
what
anyone
say
yes
i
am
sure
bindon
green
would
talk
its
head
off
and
fred
and
bert
and
charlie
prodgers
would
be
awfully
uncomfortable
and
get
every
sort
of
extraordinary
idea
into
their
heads
and
if
a
person
like
mabel
did
do
such
a
thing
as
to
have
them
up
there
she
would
be
fidgety
herself
or
she
would
be
really
fast
and
intend
them
to
go
ahead
but
lady
garribardine
is
always
quite
sure
of
herself
and
her
friends
are
too
and
they
do
have
to
consider
convention
they
are
really
gentlemen
you
see
and
not
worried
at
all
as
to
what
others
think
or
say
and
it
seems
quite
natural
to
them
to
come
up
and
see
an
old
rheumatic
lady
anywhere
they
want
to
see
her
that
is
just
the
difference
in
the
class
tild
the
upper
are
perfectly
real
and
pretend
anything
and
are
uncomfortable
in
doing
natural
things
matilda
was
still
disapproving
and
at
once
became
antagonistic
when
her
sister
made
reflections
upon
class
i
call
it
very
queer
anyway
she
sniffed
and
wherever
do
they
find
room
to
sit
in
a
bedroom
dearie
katherine
laughed
she
wondered
if
she
had
never
had
a
glimpse
of
life
and
space
and
comfort
with
lord
algy
should
she
too
have
been
as
ignorant
and
surprised
at
everything
in
her
new
sphere
as
matilda
was
at
the
description
of
it
she
supposed
she
would
have
been
equally
surprised
but
would
certainly
have
viewed
it
with
an
open
mind
after
ten
days
of
peeps
at
a
world
where
everything
new
and
old
was
looked
at
and
discussed
with
the
broadest
toleration
the
incredible
narrowness
of
the
bindon
green
outlook
appalled
her
the
forces
of
ignorance
and
prejudice
and
ridiculous
hypocrisy
which
ruled
such
hundreds
of
worthy
people
lives
she
came
back
from
these
speculations
to
the
reality
of
her
voice
reiterating
her
question
as
to
where
the
visitors
found
place
and
she
answered
still
smiling
it
is
a
great
big
room
tild
twice
as
big
as
the
at
home
no
bigger
still
and
twenty
people
could
sit
in
it
without
crowding
goodness
gracious
ejaculated
matilda
it
must
be
grand
you
see
you
are
such
an
old
goose
matilda
you
think
the
whole
world
must
be
like
bindon
green
although
i
have
told
you
over
and
over
again
that
other
places
and
other
grades
of
life
are
different
but
you
and
mabel
and
fred
and
bert
and
the
whole
crew
of
you
measure
everything
with
your
own
tiny
measure
you
make
me
gasp
at
your
outlook
sometimes
matilda
bridled
and
katherine
went
on
lady
garribardine
house
does
not
seem
to
be
a
bit
grand
to
her
nor
to
any
of
the
people
who
come
there
they
are
not
conscious
of
it
it
is
just
everyday
to
them
although
some
of
them
live
in
quite
small
houses
themselves
and
are
at
all
rich
she
has
two
cousins
elderly
ladies
who
live
in
a
tiny
flat
but
oh
the
difference
in
it
to
mabel
villa
i
had
to
take
them
a
message
last
week
and
waited
in
their
mite
of
a
it
was
exquisitely
clean
and
simple
and
they
are
probably
poorer
than
we
are
matilda
felt
too
ruffled
to
continue
this
conversation
she
always
hated
the
way
katherine
argued
with
her
she
wanted
to
get
back
to
the
far
more
interesting
subject
of
carpets
and
curtains
and
arrangements
in
the
rooms
of
lady
garribardine
house
numbers
of
the
people
in
her
serials
of
course
were
supposed
to
own
such
places
and
she
had
often
seen
bits
of
them
on
the
stage
but
until
she
found
katherine
really
lived
now
in
one
somehow
she
had
never
believed
in
them
as
living
actualities
or
rather
their
reality
had
not
been
brought
home
to
her
so
she
questioned
katherine
and
soon
had
an
accurate
description
of
her
ladyship
bedroom
and
the
rest
of
the
house
then
she
got
back
to
the
happenings
of
her
sister
day
well
when
you
have
got
up
there
you
take
down
orders
and
then
i
sort
everything
that
has
come
by
the
post
and
mark
on
the
envelopes
how
i
am
to
answer
them
and
i
sometimes
read
her
the
papers
aloud
if
her
eyes
are
tired
yes
and
then
i
go
down
and
write
the
letters
she
hardly
ever
answers
any
herself
and
i
have
to
write
them
as
if
i
were
she
her
friends
must
wonder
how
her
hand
and
style
have
changed
since
miss
arnott
left
here
was
something
thrilling
again
for
matilda
oh
my
what
a
lot
you
must
get
to
know
about
the
smart
set
kitten
is
it
interesting
yes
as
i
told
you
i
am
learning
lessons
oh
bother
that
well
what
do
they
write
about
do
tell
me
all
sorts
of
things
their
movements
their
charities
invitations
little
witticisms
about
each
other
politics
the
last
good
story
and
some
of
them
books
and
you
have
to
answer
as
if
you
were
her
however
do
you
do
it
kitten
she
gives
me
the
general
idea
she
showed
me
the
first
time
for
the
private
letters
and
now
i
know
but
sometimes
perhaps
i
write
as
if
it
were
me
and
do
they
know
it
is
not
her
hand
of
course
but
they
do
care
she
is
a
great
lady
and
a
character
and
she
is
very
powerful
in
their
circle
of
society
and
it
is
worth
everyone
while
to
be
civil
to
her
it
is
all
funny
well
what
else
do
you
do
sometimes
i
have
to
do
errands
shopping
and
so
on
and
then
my
luncheon
comes
the
food
is
lovely
and
i
am
waited
on
by
a
footman
called
thomas
he
is
the
third
and
on
wednesday
lady
garribardine
took
his
and
the
butler
heads
off
because
i
had
not
been
given
coffee
she
means
me
to
be
perfectly
treated
i
can
tell
you
coffee
after
your
lunch
how
genteel
and
my
what
a
lot
of
servants
whatever
do
they
all
do
their
work
i
suppose
you
forget
it
is
a
big
house
and
everything
is
splendidly
done
and
beautifully
clean
and
regular
and
orderly
here
matilda
insisted
upon
a
full
list
of
all
the
retainers
and
an
account
of
their
separate
duties
her
domestic
soul
revelled
in
these
details
and
at
the
end
of
the
recital
her
awe
knew
no
bounds
katherine
was
able
to
give
her
a
very
circumstantial
set
of
statements
as
all
accounts
passed
through
her
hands
well
your
old
lady
must
spend
pints
of
money
matilda
said
with
a
sigh
but
we
not
got
to
your
afternoons
yet
dearie
do
you
work
all
them
too
when
i
am
very
busy
it
depends
how
much
i
have
to
do
if
i
am
not
very
occupied
and
i
have
not
been
out
in
the
morning
i
go
for
a
walk
before
tea
i
have
to
take
her
ladyship
two
jack
and
joe
they
are
jolly
little
fellows
and
i
love
them
we
scamper
in
the
square
or
go
as
far
as
the
park
and
your
tea
they
bring
you
up
a
cup
i
suppose
every
day
regular
not
a
cup
a
whole
tray
to
myself
and
lovely
muffins
and
cream
tild
lady
garribardine
has
a
jersey
herd
of
cows
at
her
place
in
blankshire
and
the
cream
comes
up
each
day
from
there
my
how
nice
matilda
sighed
again
her
imagination
could
hardly
take
in
such
luxury
it
seemed
to
her
that
katherine
must
be
living
in
almost
gilded
vice
then
after
tea
if
i
am
not
sent
for
to
do
any
special
thing
i
read
to
myself
i
look
up
anything
that
i
do
know
about
that
i
have
chanced
to
hear
spoken
of
by
the
people
who
come
i
am
allowed
to
take
books
from
the
library
then
you
do
see
people
sometimes
matilda
interest
revived
again
what
are
they
like
kitten
sometimes
i
do
but
not
often
only
when
i
chance
to
be
sent
for
but
next
week
her
ladyship
has
got
a
big
charity
tableaux
entertainment
on
hand
that
she
is
arranger
and
patroness
of
and
i
shall
come
across
lots
of
people
of
society
some
of
the
ones
you
know
the
names
of
so
well
in
the
the
duchess
of
dashington
and
the
countess
of
blanktown
really
kitten
this
was
fashion
indeed
probably
but
i
do
know
about
the
duchess
of
dashington
i
think
lady
garribardine
approves
of
her
not
approve
of
the
duchess
of
dashington
matilda
exclaimed
indignantly
her
that
has
gentlemen
to
tea
in
her
bedroom
to
give
herself
airs
like
that
well
i
never
this
particular
duchess
photographs
were
the
joy
of
the
halfpenny
illustrated
papers
and
matilda
was
accustomed
to
see
her
in
skating
costume
waltzing
with
her
instructor
and
in
golf
costume
and
in
private
theatrical
costumes
almost
every
other
week
no
she
speaks
of
her
very
cheaply
but
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
on
sunday
fortnight
i
have
heard
everything
by
then
because
the
tableaux
will
be
over
matilda
returned
to
her
muttons
then
you
have
supper
i
suppose
no
i
go
up
and
dress
myself
and
put
on
my
best
blouse
and
have
my
dinner
at
eight
after
that
i
generally
read
the
paper
or
french
books
and
at
ten
i
go
to
bed
gracious
what
the
good
of
dressing
if
you
do
see
anyone
how
you
use
up
your
blouse
matilda
was
aghast
at
such
folly
i
am
supposed
to
be
a
lady
tild
and
a
lady
is
expected
to
dress
in
the
evening
if
she
is
alone
on
a
desert
island
what
stuff
whatever
for
fiddlesticks
presently
katherine
grew
reflective
her
catechism
over
i
wish
you
could
see
it
all
tild
it
would
enlarge
your
brain
it
is
all
so
different
from
bindon
green
if
you
could
only
hear
their
point
of
view
i
assure
you
dear
it
might
be
two
different
nations
those
barefoot
urchins
climbing
on
the
rails
are
much
nearer
their
level
than
we
are
but
matilda
could
not
stand
this
her
wrath
rose
those
dirty
boys
nearer
your
new
people
than
a
real
lady
like
mabel
cawber
and
your
own
brothers
and
sisters
katherine
how
dare
you
horrid
little
guttersnipes
with
no
pride
of
themselves
why
they
even
ashamed
to
be
here
of
a
sunday
among
decent
people
they
do
anything
that
is
just
it
tild
so
would
the
aristocrats
if
they
wanted
to
and
would
be
a
bit
ashamed
or
even
think
of
it
and
they
have
pride
of
themselves
either
but
you
never
understand
tild
not
if
you
live
to
be
a
hundred
years
old
and
i
do
want
to
there
then
it
is
perfectly
useless
my
talking
i
see
that
we
had
better
go
and
have
some
tea
and
so
they
turned
out
of
albert
gate
and
walked
to
victoria
matilda
when
she
had
smoothed
her
ruffled
feelings
began
now
to
relate
the
home
news
gladys
and
her
fianc√©
were
not
happy
together
they
had
not
been
so
since
that
visit
which
katherine
would
remember
they
had
taken
to
brighton
to
stay
with
his
aunt
it
was
nearly
six
weeks
ago
now
and
both
grew
more
and
more
gloomy
and
so
uppy
as
glad
is
with
fred
too
and
never
a
bit
back
on
bob
hartley
matilda
felt
things
would
be
better
for
her
sister
if
a
little
more
spirit
were
shown
mabel
and
her
betrothed
had
been
up
for
church
parade
as
usual
in
the
park
that
morning
and
this
lady
had
also
supped
with
them
at
laburnum
villa
the
night
before
and
they
had
had
oysters
and
a
jolly
time
katherine
felt
a
strange
emotion
when
she
heard
of
this
she
seemed
to
see
a
picture
of
lord
algy
enjoying
oysters
and
all
the
reflections
this
action
had
called
up
oh
how
long
ago
it
all
appeared
and
have
you
met
that
gentlemen
you
spoke
of
matilda
asked
before
they
parted
at
the
station
strobridge
you
mean
lady
garribardine
nephew
yes
he
is
husband
of
the
lady
glad
dresses
the
one
who
had
the
model
she
wanted
me
to
have
he
is
a
clever
man
we
have
not
really
spoken
yet
but
i
mean
to
know
him
very
well
some
day
oh
kitten
do
be
careful
and
him
a
married
man
too
for
what
i
want
of
him
it
does
not
matter
whether
he
is
married
or
single
katherine
reassured
her
and
soon
the
train
moved
off
how
good
matilda
was
katherine
thought
as
she
walked
briskly
back
to
berkeley
square
an
unselfish
worthy
honest
hopelessly
stupid
creature
whom
somehow
she
was
fond
of
but
what
could
it
be
that
made
her
herself
so
utterly
different
from
them
all
nothing
could
be
chance
everything
had
its
reason
only
we
were
generally
too
blind
to
perceive
it
so
was
there
some
truth
in
that
vague
story
of
the
having
been
someone
of
high
family
fallen
low
in
the
world
and
married
to
the
auctioneer
whom
her
own
father
remembered
very
well
could
it
be
that
some
drop
of
gentle
blood
flowed
in
her
veins
transmitted
from
this
source
and
concentrated
in
her
having
escaped
the
others
or
was
it
simply
from
the
years
of
her
reading
that
her
mind
had
developed
but
it
could
not
be
altogether
that
because
she
remembered
instincts
and
tastes
in
uneducated
early
childhood
completely
aloof
from
the
family
father
gave
me
this
business
capacity
she
mused
but
something
beyond
must
have
given
me
this
will
to
achieve
and
i
achieve
all
i
desire
in
time
only
i
must
be
ruthless
and
have
no
emotions
i
must
follow
what
bacon
asserts
about
great
spirits
and
she
quoted
softly
is
not
one
that
hath
been
transported
to
the
mad
degree
of
love
which
shows
that
great
spirits
and
great
business
do
keep
out
this
weak
passion
yes
she
would
keep
out
this
weak
passion
she
had
tasted
its
joys
and
that
memory
must
last
her
a
lifetime
on
the
doorstep
she
encountered
gerard
strobridge
just
coming
out
he
raised
his
hat
and
said
politely
that
it
was
an
abominably
cold
day
then
he
passed
on
down
the
steps
and
so
towards
hill
street
and
katherine
bush
went
up
to
her
room
chapter
ix
the
week
of
the
tableaux
had
come
and
gone
and
had
opened
yet
another
window
for
katherine
bush
to
peep
at
the
world
from
she
already
knew
many
of
the
people
who
came
to
the
luncheons
and
rehearsals
from
their
letters
and
now
she
judged
of
them
face
to
face
she
had
been
in
great
request
to
take
down
innumerable
orders
and
arrange
business
details
and
had
listened
and
inwardly
digested
what
she
heard
her
contempt
for
some
of
the
company
was
as
great
as
for
miss
mabel
cawber
she
discovered
a
few
with
titles
and
positions
who
were
what
she
disdainfully
dubbed
middle
class
underneath
only
that
they
have
been
more
used
to
things
they
are
as
paltry
as
mabel
she
said
to
herself
and
set
about
as
was
her
custom
to
find
out
why
and
from
what
families
they
had
sprung
and
obtained
some
satisfaction
in
the
confirmation
of
her
theory
of
heredity
in
discovering
that
most
of
these
could
lay
small
claim
to
blueness
of
blood
the
insolence
of
others
she
approved
of
many
of
the
american
peeresses
who
were
posing
as
queens
and
nuns
and
greek
goddesses
she
truly
admired
they
must
have
been
at
one
time
like
herself
out
to
learn
and
now
were
conscious
that
they
had
made
good
but
i
mean
to
have
more
repose
of
manner
when
i
am
there
she
told
herself
of
sarah
lady
garribardine
sayings
and
views
she
kept
a
great
store
in
her
mind
this
was
a
real
aristocrat
she
felt
a
human
faulty
strong
woman
incapable
of
meanness
or
anything
which
could
lower
the
flag
of
her
order
she
was
supremely
insolent
too
but
then
she
never
did
anything
which
could
impair
people
respect
she
was
hard
and
generous
and
acted
up
to
the
doctrine
that
and
entirely
believed
in
the
divine
right
of
kings
and
of
sarah
lady
garribardine
she
had
not
been
a
thirteenth
century
daughter
for
nothing
katherine
bush
shared
every
one
of
her
views
and
moulded
all
her
ideals
upon
them
each
day
she
was
enlarging
her
vocabulary
of
words
to
use
adapting
sentences
which
she
had
read
of
fine
english
to
modern
requirements
pruning
colloquialisms
cultivating
pronunciation
polishing
her
critical
faculties
she
was
perfectly
conscious
that
she
had
often
employed
homely
phrases
in
the
past
and
had
not
always
paid
enough
attention
to
grammar
in
speaking
though
for
some
time
she
had
not
used
whatever
for
or
of
a
sunday
as
poor
matilda
always
did
she
learned
as
much
comparatively
of
the
general
world
of
society
in
that
one
week
as
she
had
learned
of
the
nature
of
man
in
her
three
days
with
lord
algy
he
was
her
first
step
these
women
were
her
second
lady
garribardine
was
her
head
master
and
gerard
strobridge
should
be
her
tutor
when
the
moment
she
was
ready
for
him
came
her
suspicions
as
to
her
employer
disapproval
of
the
duchess
of
dashington
were
realised
fully
one
day
in
the
beginning
of
the
week
the
poor
lady
rheumatism
was
very
painful
and
she
remained
in
her
room
having
her
favourite
nephew
and
delemar
up
with
her
there
to
lunch
on
a
little
table
close
to
her
gilt
bed
katherine
was
writing
at
an
escritoire
near
having
finished
her
own
meal
downstairs
you
need
not
go
miss
bush
if
you
can
continue
those
invitations
with
our
chatter
so
katherine
stayed
the
three
talked
of
many
things
at
first
and
katherine
hardly
noticed
them
but
presently
her
attention
was
caught
by
a
name
strobridge
was
saying
seraphim
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
refuse
dulcie
dashington
she
has
written
to
beatrice
this
morning
she
is
quite
determined
to
play
the
part
of
nell
gwyn
as
the
then
she
can
play
it
in
some
other
but
not
in
these
that
i
am
arranging
her
ladyship
voice
was
acid
but
why
dearest
sarah
are
you
so
down
on
poor
dulcie
delemar
protested
she
is
really
a
very
good
sort
and
looks
so
splendid
in
these
rather
common
clothes
i
am
not
hard
on
her
l√§o
i
am
sure
had
she
been
the
wife
of
a
jolly
young
stockbroker
addicted
to
low
practical
jokes
and
rowdy
sport
she
would
have
been
a
most
admirable
creature
it
is
not
the
woman
i
am
down
on
there
is
just
such
another
at
blissington
she
helps
me
with
the
bazaars
and
the
school
treats
her
husband
is
a
local
brewer
and
we
are
capital
friends
it
is
the
duchess
of
dashington
i
ostracise
as
i
consider
she
has
done
more
to
degrade
her
order
in
these
socialistic
days
than
any
other
member
of
our
sadly
humbled
peerage
the
other
two
laughed
amusedly
but
lady
garribardine
went
on
raising
her
voice
a
little
it
was
a
subject
upon
which
she
felt
so
deeply
that
it
overcame
for
the
moment
her
usual
dryly
humorous
handling
of
any
matter
let
her
have
her
lovers
we
have
all
had
lovers
no
one
in
the
least
objects
to
them
arranged
suitably
and
of
one
own
class
i
am
not
concerned
with
her
or
any
other
woman
physical
such
morality
is
a
question
of
temperament
and
geography
and
custom
but
i
am
profoundly
concerned
to
endeavour
to
keep
up
some
semblance
of
dignity
in
the
aristocracy
and
dulcie
dashington
has
lowered
the
whole
prestige
of
duchesses
because
she
is
of
gentle
birth
though
heaven
knows
what
her
father
was
with
poor
dear
susan
irresponsible
ways
gerard
strobridge
smiled
as
he
lit
a
cigarette
there
is
a
great
deal
in
what
you
say
seraphim
she
has
certainly
dragged
the
title
down
a
good
deal
with
her
fancies
for
professional
gamesters
of
all
sorts
for
friends
and
her
total
disregard
of
tradition
at
dashington
but
you
forget
that
she
has
had
a
good
deal
to
put
up
with
from
toni
who
is
an
impossible
husband
no
man
is
an
impossible
husband
if
he
is
a
duke
at
least
no
duchess
ought
to
find
him
so
and
if
he
were
that
is
not
the
slightest
excuse
when
a
woman
undertakes
a
great
position
she
should
realise
that
personal
feelings
have
ceased
to
count
she
has
so
to
speak
accepted
the
responsibility
of
guarding
the
safety
of
an
order
just
as
a
sentry
is
responsible
when
he
is
on
duty
he
would
be
shot
in
war
time
if
he
fell
asleep
on
duty
however
pitiful
his
case
might
be
from
hardship
and
want
of
rest
he
would
be
shot
as
an
example
to
the
others
not
to
allow
even
nature
to
overcome
them
and
endanger
the
post
illustration
man
is
an
impossible
husband
if
he
is
a
duke
it
seems
very
cruel
piped
delemar
not
at
all
lady
garribardine
flashed
while
her
voice
vibrated
with
scorn
we
are
at
war
now
with
the
radical
masses
and
can
not
afford
to
jeopardise
positions
either
keep
up
prestige
or
throw
up
the
game
and
let
the
whole
thing
go
by
the
board
but
while
we
pretend
there
is
still
an
aristocracy
in
england
we
the
members
of
it
should
defend
it
dulcie
dashington
and
her
ways
and
her
photographs
in
the
papers
and
her
vulgarity
and
the
flaunting
of
her
unsavoury
domestic
affairs
are
a
byword
and
as
long
as
i
have
a
voice
in
society
and
can
lay
some
claim
to
power
i
shall
let
it
be
known
what
my
opinion
is
and
why
i
will
not
receive
her
to
me
there
is
no
sin
like
betraying
an
order
i
suppose
you
are
quite
right
delemar
now
agreed
meekly
but
there
are
such
lots
of
odd
people
in
society
who
do
things
it
is
these
boys
marrying
these
wretched
actresses
or
americans
which
has
changed
everything
not
at
all
contradicted
her
ladyship
boys
have
always
married
actresses
from
time
to
time
and
some
of
them
have
proved
very
decent
creatures
and
if
they
do
err
what
does
it
matter
no
one
expects
better
from
them
they
are
making
no
real
breach
in
the
and
as
for
americans
they
are
often
very
pretty
and
so
clever
that
they
seldom
disgrace
their
new
station
they
are
like
converts
to
rome
more
zealous
than
the
born
papists
the
only
evil
which
can
lie
at
their
door
is
that
they
have
too
much
money
and
have
given
false
values
to
entertaining
and
perhaps
have
encouraged
eccentric
no
my
dear
child
it
is
the
themselves
who
have
lost
and
have
lowered
the
flag
and
when
one
of
really
high
birth
does
it
like
dulcie
dashington
she
should
be
made
to
pay
the
price
this
was
unanswerable
katherine
bush
thought
as
she
listened
and
she
wondered
why
the
other
two
should
chaff
lightly
as
though
it
were
just
one
of
lady
garribardine
notions
that
is
what
generally
astonished
her
a
good
deal
no
one
appeared
to
have
any
convictions
or
enthusiasm
they
seemed
to
her
to
be
a
company
of
drifters
so
little
energy
appeared
to
be
shown
by
any
of
them
they
were
unpunctual
and
unpractical
but
they
were
amusing
and
deliciously
if
they
had
any
real
feelings
none
appeared
upon
the
surface
even
lady
beatrice
and
her
coterie
of
highly
evolved
poetesses
and
other
artistic
worldings
flew
from
theme
to
theme
turning
intent
faces
upon
new
fads
each
week
most
people
manners
were
casual
and
their
attitudes
too
would
often
have
shocked
mabel
cawber
so
far
were
they
from
being
genteel
the
few
who
truly
fulfilled
katherine
bush
ideas
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
lady
stood
out
like
stars
but
with
all
these
flaws
as
a
collection
of
people
there
was
that
ease
of
manner
that
total
absence
of
about
them
which
never
could
be
known
at
green
i
suppose
times
are
changed
katherine
told
herself
and
the
laxity
is
producing
a
new
type
i
do
wonder
how
they
would
all
behave
if
some
cataclysm
happened
again
like
the
french
revolution
but
when
my
day
comes
i
mean
to
uphold
the
order
which
i
shall
join
as
her
ladyship
does
at
the
last
moment
lady
beatrice
did
not
go
as
ganymede
to
the
artist
models
ball
the
history
of
her
alteration
of
character
was
a
rather
bitterly
humorous
story
for
gerard
strobridge
ears
she
had
been
trying
on
the
dress
when
a
note
had
arrived
with
a
parcel
for
her
from
her
husband
aunt
which
contained
a
very
beautiful
greek
mantle
with
these
few
words
i
send
you
this
mantle
which
i
hope
you
will
wear
it
will
not
really
spoil
the
character
of
your
ganymede
dress
and
from
the
back
it
will
hide
the
fact
that
your
legs
are
very
slightly
bowed
your
charming
face
will
help
to
distract
eyes
from
the
front
view
and
this
very
small
flaw
in
your
anatomy
will
pass
unnoticed
affectionately
yours
sarah
garribardine
she
had
written
it
with
her
own
hand
lady
beatrice
stamped
with
rage
and
then
flew
to
her
she
stood
this
way
and
that
and
finally
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
might
be
the
faintest
substratum
of
truth
in
the
accusation
the
rest
of
the
limbs
were
not
so
perfect
as
her
tiny
ankles
it
would
not
be
safe
to
risk
criticism
so
the
costume
was
altered
and
became
a
flora
with
garlands
of
roses
and
long
diaphanous
draperies
and
gerard
and
lady
garribardine
watched
her
entry
with
the
vermont
party
with
relieved
eyes
and
the
wily
aunt
said
you
can
achieve
the
impossible
with
women
if
you
only
appeal
to
or
wound
their
vanity
you
must
never
give
orders
to
one
unless
she
is
in
love
with
you
then
she
glories
in
obedience
but
a
modern
wife
can
only
be
controlled
either
on
the
principle
of
the
pig
being
driven
towards
dublin
when
it
was
intended
for
cork
or
by
a
machiavellian
manipulation
of
her
and
then
the
game
is
not
worth
the
candle
strobridge
sighed
with
a
little
discouragement
i
wonder
seraphim
what
is
worth
while
striving
for
the
infinite
i
suppose
certainly
the
finite
things
are
but
dead
sea
fruit
gerard
my
poor
boy
you
make
me
fear
when
you
talk
like
that
that
one
day
you
will
be
profoundly
in
love
heaven
forbid
it
would
upset
my
digestion
i
was
last
month
and
have
to
be
careful
and
in
her
comfortable
bed
in
berkeley
square

read
the
letters
of
lady
mary
wortley
montagu
far
into
the
night
society
had
not
altered
in
many
respects
since
these
hundred
and
sixty
odd
years
ago
she
thought
the
tableaux
were
the
greatest
success
and
a
large
sum
of
money
was
secured
for
one
of
lady
garribardine
pet
charities
time
went
on
christmas
was
approaching
it
was
to
be
spent
at
blissington
court
the
place
lady
garribardine
had
inherited
with
the
barony
of
from
her
father
garribardine
was
a
scotch
title
while
her
ladyship
was
rabidly
english
they
would
go
down
to
blissington
and
have
a
family
party
her
three
grandchildren
her
daughter
lady
mereton
was
far
away
the
bored
wife
of
a
colonial
governor
gerard
strobridge
and
perhaps
lady
beatrice
and
the
two
old
cousins
with
a
young
niece
of
theirs
and
a
stray
man
or
two
and
delemar
but
no
one
could
be
sure
who
would
turn
up
at
the
end
katherine
was
not
to
have
any
holiday
she
had
come
too
recently
her
employer
explained
to
her
and
the
christmas
accumulations
were
quite
beyond
her
power
to
tackle
alone
katherine
was
grateful
she
looked
forward
to
seeing
this
country
home
with
pleasure
she
had
been
kept
unusually
busy
and
so
had
very
rarely
seen
any
one
except
her
ladyship
but
one
morning
about
ten
days
before
they
were
to
go
down
into
blankshire
lady
garribardine
informed
her
secretary
she
was
to
be
given
for
the
whole
afternoon
to
strobridge
to
type
a
quantity
of
letters
about
a
new
charity
he
was
arranging
for
her
my
nephew
dictates
abominably
but
he
said
that
you
had
understood
him
so
well
that
first
evening
when
you
arrived
a
month
ago
that
he
has
asked
me
to
lend
you
to
him
for
this
business
and
i
have
consented
he
will
lunch
here
so
have
plenty
of
paper
ready
for
the
afternoon
then
as
katherine
was
leaving
the
room
she
handed
her
a
note
here
is
a
little
present
for
you
miss
bush
for
christmas
i
want
you
to
buy
yourself
an
evening
frock
you
must
dine
with
us
on
christmas
day
and
perhaps
you
had
not
provided
for
this
possibility
i
am
very
pleased
with
you
girl
you
work
splendidly
katherine
coloured
to
the
roots
of
her
glistening
hair
she
could
not
analyse
her
emotions
she
hated
presents
and
yet
she
was
gratified
at
the
kindliness
and
appreciation
which
lay
in
the
manner
of
the
gift
your
ladyship
is
too
good
she
said
very
low
i
have
simply
done
my
duty
but
i
will
endeavour
to
buy
something
suitable
with
the
money
which
is
far
more
than
enough
the
old
lady
looked
at
her
critically
with
her
head
a
little
on
one
side
she
understood
what
the
blush
had
arisen
from
and
she
appreciated
the
pride
in
the
girl
the
creature
must
have
some
breeding
in
her
somewhere
in
spite
of
the
auctioneer
parentage
i
must
talk
to
her
when
we
get
to
blissington
she
may
prove
a
great
interest
for
my
old
age
but
she
said
aloud
well
get
what
you
like
with
it
i
leave
it
to
you
your
taste
is
excellent
and
while
you
are
out
pay
these
two
bills
for
me
and
take
a
little
walk
you
have
been
looking
rather
pale
i
fear
you
have
not
taken
enough
outdoor
exercise
lately
katherine
thanked
her
and
went
rapidly
to
her
room
a
sense
of
excitement
and
anticipation
in
her
heart
this
might
prove
an
interesting
afternoon
there
she
reviewed
her
wardrobe
her
dressy
blouse
from
oxford
street
was
too
ornate
for
the
daytime
and
she
thought
now
in
rather
bad
taste
and
her
morning
ones
were
too
dowdy
this
was
a
great
occasion
and
one
which
she
had
been
waiting
for
she
was
to
go
home
late
on
this
friday
to
stay
the
night
at
bindon
green
matilda
had
insisted
upon
it
because
it
was
her
birthday
she
would
be
thirty
years
old
she
had
been
quite
tearful
about
it
on
the
second
occasion
on
which
she
had
met
her
sister
in
the
park
you
need
not
cast
us
all
off
like
this
kitten
she
pleaded
and
we
shall
have
mabel
and
a
few
other
friends
on
friday
night
and
fred
has
given
us
a
lot
of
lovely
new
nigger
song
records
for
the
gramophone
and
it
will
all
be
so
awfully
jolly
so
katherine
had
promised
to
go
and
this
fell
in
admirably
with
her
plans
there
would
be
a
real
excuse
for
her
to
have
her
hair
waved
she
had
been
given
the
evening
off
and
it
was
known
that
she
was
going
home
she
would
consult
gladys
again
for
the
frock
for
christmas
night
and
buy
what
was
necessary
on
her
way
back
to
berkeley
square
on
the
morrow
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
a
hairdresser
had
ever
touched
her
thick
mop
of
hair
and
she
had
no
idea
of
the
difference
to
her
appearance
that
it
would
make
but
so
critical
and
observant
of
all
things
had
become
her
eye
that
she
realised
with
her
first
peep
in
the
mirror
when
the
ondulation
was
complete
that
it
had
turned
her
into
almost
a
beauty
the
broad
waves
fell
back
from
the
parting
and
showed
the
admirable
planting
of
her
brow
and
the
greek
setting
of
her
magnetic
eyes
she
allowed
no
elaboration
of
fashion
but
had
her
ample
tresses
bound
tightly
to
her
head
the
effect
was
distinguished
and
gave
her
satisfaction
then
from
the
hairdresser
she
went
and
bought
another
blouse
something
pale
grey
and
becoming
and
with
the
parcel
she
got
back
to
berkeley
square
in
good
time
for
luncheon
and
began
to
dress
herself
she
was
glad
her
hands
were
so
white
she
had
lately
taken
to
giving
great
care
to
the
polish
of
her
nails
she
wished
her
feet
were
smaller
but
they
were
well
shaped
and
no
one
feet
were
really
small
nowadays
lady
garribardine
had
said
she
was
quite
content
with
the
picture
she
saw
in
her
before
she
went
downstairs
it
was
of
a
tall
slim
girl
with
a
very
white
smooth
face
extraordinary
eyes
under
level
dark
brows
and
a
big
red
mouth
and
hair
of
silvery
fairness
that
glistened
grey
not
gold
in
its
lights
she
knew
very
well
that
she
was
attractive
and
gave
one
of
her
rare
soft
laughs
a
month
and
more
of
mental
discipline
and
acute
observation
of
those
in
that
status
of
refinement
to
which
she
wished
to
attain
had
given
her
numerous
subtle
distinctions
of
manner
which
she
had
not
possessed
before
she
looked
like
a
lady
and
felt
that
she
was
approaching
the
time
when
she
herself
most
severe
of
all
critics
might
consider
herself
to
be
one
she
was
nearly
as
excited
as
on
that
afternoon
when
she
had
left
livingstone
and
devereux
to
go
on
a
three
days
honeymoon
with
lord
algy
she
made
herself
eat
her
luncheon
as
calmly
as
usual
and
then
when
the
tray
had
been
taken
away
she
opened
the
window
wide
and
poured
a
packet
of
cedarwood
dust
on
the
fire
and
she
was
sitting
demurely
at
the
table
when
from
the
library
lady
garribardine
and
strobridge
came
in
gerard
strobridge
carried
a
bag
full
of
papers
and
looked
cross
and
harassed
now
you
may
have
the
services
of
miss
bush
until
five
that
will
give
you
two
hours
and
a
half
you
must
not
keep
her
as
she
is
going
home
then
come
up
to
my
to
tea
and
lady
garribardine
went
out
of
the
other
door
which
her
nephew
held
open
for
her
katherine
had
risen
and
gone
immediately
to
a
cupboard
ostensibly
to
get
something
out
for
her
work
so
she
hoped
her
ladyship
had
not
remarked
her
hair
which
indeed
had
happily
been
the
case
strobridge
had
not
even
glanced
in
her
direction
but
her
moment
came
when
she
sat
down
at
the
typing
machine
and
looked
straight
up
into
his
eyes
as
she
asked
in
her
deep
alluring
voice
what
do
you
wish
me
to
begin
upon
please
then
he
took
in
the
whole
effect
and
a
wave
of
intense
astonishment
swept
over
him
what
had
happened
was
he
dreaming
was
this
beautiful
creature
the
ordinary
silent
admirable
typist
katherine
bush
chapter
x
he
pulled
himself
together
and
took
some
papers
from
his
bag
without
speaking
and
when
he
had
selected
two
or
three
he
drew
a
chair
up
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
and
began
to
dictate
stopping
every
now
and
then
to
explain
the
purport
of
his
arguments
they
worked
so
for
perhaps
an
hour
one
has
to
do
these
things
he
said
at
last
as
katherine
had
not
uttered
a
word
one
wonders
sometimes
if
there
is
any
good
in
them
i
suppose
all
effort
has
some
merit
she
responded
without
looking
up
he
began
to
long
to
make
her
raise
her
eyes
again
you
think
so
on
what
grounds
it
exercises
a
useful
faculty
what
faculty
will
of
course
to
use
effort
is
an
exercise
of
will
because
if
there
was
no
effort
needed
no
will
would
be
required
either
he
smiled
whimsically
this
was
obvious
then
i
must
look
upon
the
organisation
of
this
very
intricate
charity
of
doubtful
use
to
mankind
as
profitable
to
me
because
of
the
effort
entailed
it
is
as
good
a
way
as
any
other
of
looking
at
did
you
say
quarterly
or
monthly
returns
upon
the
capital
oh
er
glancing
at
his
papers
the
confounded
thing
where
is
it
yes
quarterly
the
machine
clicked
uninterruptedly
katherine
never
looked
up
he
began
to
allow
himself
to
take
in
details
why
had
he
not
remarked
before
that
she
had
an
extraordinarily
head
and
what
wonderful
hands
in
these
days
of
athletic
paws
she
would
be
very
stately
too
when
she
filled
out
a
little
the
whole
thing
was
agreeably
symmetrical
throat
and
shoulders
and
bust
and
hips
why
in
the
name
of
all
the
gods
have
i
never
noticed
this
young
woman
before
she
thinks
too
that
was
a
curious
reflection
about
will
like
to
talk
to
her
the
devil
takes
this
d
d
charity
so
his
thoughts
ran
and
his
eyes
eagerly
devoured
katherine
face
she
was
perfectly
conscious
of
the
fact
she
knew
with
unerring
instinct
that
the
spark
which
she
had
dispatched
by
that
first
steady
gaze
of
her
eyes
had
struck
tinder
the
flame
of
interest
was
ignited
and
the
more
difficult
she
made
things
now
the
more
complete
would
be
her
triumph
presently
she
resolutely
kept
her
attention
upon
her
work
never
raising
her
head
to
be
so
meritoriously
industrious
are
you
using
effort
he
asked
in
a
moment
or
two
you
look
as
though
you
had
a
most
formidable
will
very
little
effort
it
is
second
nature
to
me
now
even
if
the
subject
is
as
uninteresting
as
this
that
is
all
the
better
one
can
let
one
mechanical
brain
tackle
it
and
one
real
thoughts
can
wander
where
to
she
put
in
a
fresh
sheet
of
paper
and
now
glanced
at
him
again
for
one
second
into
dreamland
yes
that
is
a
ridiculously
pleasant
place
devoid
of
draughts
and
of
chilling
surprises
it
would
be
very
impertinent
i
suppose
if
i
asked
you
where
is
your
dreamland
perhaps
not
impertinent
out
of
place
you
are
dictating
a
letter
to
the
lord
mayor
of
london
at
the
moment
to
be
sure
i
am
you
made
me
forget
it
he
is
an
infernal
bore
the
lord
mayor
of
london
compelling
me
to
branch
off
from
this
very
interesting
conversation
to
his
confounded
letter
i
beg
your
pardon
katherine
read
aloud
the
last
coherent
sentence
he
had
given
her
and
she
permitted
one
of
her
faint
sphinxlike
smiles
to
play
about
her
mouth
while
her
eyes
sought
the
typing
gerard
strobridge
moved
a
little
nearer
he
felt
a
sudden
strong
thrill
i
shall
not
give
you
another
word
to
type
until
you
tell
me
about
your
dreamland
is
it
in
sea
or
sky
or
air
it
is
three
and
you
are
only
to
stay
until
five
had
you
not
better
attend
to
your
work
first
sir
she
was
waiting
in
an
attitude
of
respectful
attention
infinitely
provoking
certainly
not
i
shall
ask
my
aunt
to
lend
you
to
me
for
another
day
if
we
do
not
finish
this
afternoon
indeed
on
second
thoughts
i
do
not
think
i
shall
try
to
finish
we
can
complete
the
matter
at
blissington
and
then
he
stopped
abruptly
l√§o
delemar
would
be
there
he
had
melted
her
into
a
mood
from
which
everything
could
be
hoped
during
this
week
of
uneventful
family
party
beatrice
would
only
stay
for
christmas
day
and
was
indeed
no
great
obstacle
in
any
case
but
he
feared
he
would
probably
not
be
able
to
have
interesting
business
interviews
during
the
holidays
with
his
aunt
typist
he
laughed
shortly
to
himself
and
dictated
a
long
sentence
concluding
the
letter
to
the
lord
mayor
he
had
better
control
the
interest
he
was
feeling
that
was
evident
katherine
made
no
remark
while
she
wondered
what
had
stopped
his
questioning
so
suddenly
she
smiled
again
a
little
it
had
the
desired
effect
strobridge
jumped
up
from
his
chair
and
went
to
the
fireplace
well
what
are
you
thinking
about
he
demanded
from
there
my
work
of
course
what
else
should
i
be
thinking
about
her
eyes
at
last
met
his
in
innocent
surprise
i
do
believe
you
are
quite
truthful
one
does
not
smile
in
that
enigmatic
fashion
over
work
dull
tedious
work
like
this
statistics
of
bodies
who
are
to
benefit
by
this
absurd
charity
oh
no
fair
scribe
i
feel
there
lies
a
world
of
malice
in
that
smile
even
a
scribe
is
permitted
sometimes
to
make
reflections
not
without
confessing
what
they
are
we
are
not
in
the
days
of
the
spanish
inquisition
taking
up
a
paper
on
the
first
list
there
is
a
letter
for
the
mayor
of
manchester
confound
the
mayor
of
manchester
poor
gentleman
i
must
know
all
about
dreamland
and
cryptic
reflections
first
he
drew
the
armchair
now
over
towards
her
and
flung
himself
into
it
he
was
a
graceful
creature
not
so
tall
or
so
ideally
perfect
of
form
as
lord
algy
but
a
very
presentable
englishman
with
a
wonderful
distinction
of
manner
and
voice
katherine
bush
was
experiencing
intense
pleasure
there
was
something
feline
if
not
altogether
feminine
in
her
brain
it
was
peculiarly
gratifying
to
find
that
her
plans
were
being
justified
how
glad
she
was
that
he
had
not
remarked
her
in
her
raw
days
how
wise
she
had
been
to
have
made
ready
and
then
waited
the
whole
thing
was
the
more
effective
because
of
the
complete
absence
of
all
dramatic
emotion
in
her
she
was
like
a
quiet
capable
foreign
minister
playing
his
game
of
statecraft
with
the
representative
of
another
country
his
face
permitted
to
express
or
conceal
only
what
he
desired
at
this
moment
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
very
slightly
as
though
to
say
i
am
only
an
employe
i
can
not
force
you
to
work
if
you
will
not
but
she
did
not
speak
so
he
was
obliged
to
demand
again
wo
you
tell
me
what
made
you
smile
we
can
drift
to
dreamland
afterwards
no
i
will
not
tell
you
what
made
me
smile
because
i
do
not
know
exactly
the
aspect
of
life
generally
perhaps
and
you
sit
and
work
in
this
gloomy
back
room
all
day
what
do
you
know
about
life
i
am
observing
i
know
that
one
must
pretend
interest
in
what
one
is
bored
by
and
one
must
show
attention
to
those
one
despises
and
keep
from
laughing
at
things
what
a
dangerous
young
woman
watching
and
coming
to
cynical
conclusions
but
you
say
truly
one
must
keep
from
laughing
at
things
a
very
difficult
matter
generally
he
lay
back
against
the
brown
leather
cushion
and
proved
the
truth
of
this
by
laughing
softly
while
he
looked
at
her
quaintly
katherine
bush
suddenly
felt
that
a
human
being
understood
it
was
a
delightful
sensation
practically
the
whole
of
life
is
a
ridiculous
sham
and
must
arouse
the
sardonic
mirth
of
the
gods
here
are
you
and
i
spending
an
afternoon
arranging
a
charity
in
which
neither
of
us
takes
the
least
interest
i
am
dictating
fulsome
letters
to
lord
mayors
to
induce
them
to
influence
others
to
open
their
purses
i
do
care
a
jot
whether
they
do
or
they
do
not
you
are
mechanically
transcribing
my
asinine
words
and
we
could
be
so
much
better
employed
exchanging
views
on
each
other
taste
say
or
each
other
dreamlands
katherine
bush
looked
down
and
allowed
her
hands
to
fall
idly
in
her
lap
he
should
do
most
of
the
speaking
the
only
good
that
i
have
been
getting
out
of
it
as
far
as
i
can
see
he
went
on
is
the
contemplation
of
your
really
beautiful
hands
at
work
where
did
you
get
such
perfect
things
in
these
days
she
lifted
one
and
regarded
it
critically
yes
i
have
often
wondered
myself
my
father
was
an
auctioneer
you
know
and
my
mother
father
was
a
butcher
gerard
strobridge
was
extremely
entertained
she
was
certainly
a
very
wonderful
product
of
such
parentage
may
i
look
at
them
closely
he
asked
she
showed
not
the
least
embarrassment
if
he
had
been
asking
to
see
a
piece
of
enamel
or
a
china
vase
she
could
not
have
been
more
detached
about
it
she
held
them
out
quite
naturally
and
he
rose
and
took
them
in
his
own
their
touch
was
cool
and
firm
and
every
inch
of
his
being
tingled
with
pleasure
he
examined
them
minutely
finger
by
finger
stroking
the
rosy
filbert
nails
in
admiration
while
an
insane
desire
to
clasp
and
kiss
their
owner
grew
in
him
katherine
bush
was
perfectly
aware
of
this
and
when
she
thought
he
had
felt
emotion
enough
for
the
occasion
she
drew
them
back
as
naturally
as
she
had
given
them
i
am
always
asking
myself
questions
about
such
things
she
remarked
in
a
tone
of
speculative
i
am
so
often
seeing
contradictions
since
i
have
been
here
my
former
conclusions
are
a
little
upset
what
were
they
he
had
returned
to
his
chair
he
was
no
novice
to
be
carried
away
by
his
sensations
and
he
knew
very
well
that
to
indulge
them
further
at
present
would
be
very
unwise
and
perhaps
check
a
most
promising
amusement
i
believed
that
birth
and
breeding
gave
fine
ears
and
fine
ankles
and
fine
hands
as
well
as
moral
qualities
and
you
have
been
disappointed
yes
very
have
not
you
no
because
i
have
had
no
illusions
one
never
can
tell
where
a
side
cross
comes
in
or
what
will
be
the
effect
of
overbreeding
that
runs
to
enormities
sometimes
i
suppose
so
and
have
the
moral
qualities
surprised
you
also
oh
yes
more
than
the
physical
i
have
seen
and
heard
what
i
would
have
thought
were
common
things
even
at
bindon
green
he
laughed
again
if
the
crew
who
had
attended
the
tableaux
rehearsals
could
have
heard
her
you
are
perfectly
right
looked
at
in
the
abstract
i
suppose
we
are
rather
a
shoddy
company
nowadays
there
are
individuals
who
come
up
to
the
measure
of
course
but
not
all
of
them
as
i
had
imagined
you
must
have
opened
the
doors
to
quite
ordinary
people
to
have
made
such
a
mixture
we
have
grown
indifferent
we
no
longer
care
about
a
standard
i
fear
that
is
why
you
let
all
these
radicals
be
in
power
perhaps
you
have
become
effete
like
the
nobles
before
the
revolution
in
france
who
could
only
die
like
gentlemen
but
not
live
like
men
gerard
strobridge
was
startled
this
from
the
granddaughter
of
a
butcher
of
bindon
green
she
picks
it
all
up
from
seraphim
of
course
he
reflected
presently
and
yet
look
at
her
strange
face
it
is
a
woman
of
parts
from
wherever
it
has
come
that
is
an
apt
phrase
where
did
you
find
it
like
gentleman
but
not
live
like
men
i
do
know
it
just
came
from
thinking
and
reading
about
them
so
much
was
fine
and
so
much
foolish
yes
and
you
think
we
are
growing
also
to
that
stage
in
england
perhaps
you
are
right
we
want
some
great
national
danger
to
pull
us
together
you
will
rust
out
otherwise
and
it
will
be
such
a
pity
you
think
we
are
good
enough
to
keep
in
your
highest
development
like
her
ladyship
you
are
i
should
think
the
best
things
for
a
country
in
the
world
she
knew
he
was
drawing
her
out
and
was
very
pleased
to
be
so
drawn
tell
me
about
us
what
have
we
that
is
good
you
have
a
sense
of
values
you
know
what
is
worth
having
you
have
had
hundreds
of
years
to
acquire
the
quality
of
looking
ahead
no
person
of
the
classes
from
which
the
radical
statesmen
are
drawn
has
naturally
the
quality
of
looking
ahead
he
has
to
be
told
about
it
and
then
get
it
if
he
can
it
is
not
in
his
blood
because
his
forebears
only
had
to
snatch
what
they
could
for
themselves
and
their
families
day
by
day
and
were
not
required
to
observe
any
broad
horizon
how
very
true
you
are
a
student
of
heredity
then
miss
bush
yes
it
explains
everything
i
examine
it
in
myself
i
am
always
combating
ordinary
and
cramping
instincts
which
i
find
i
have
got
how
interesting
no
common
radical
could
be
a
successful
foreign
minister
for
instance
unless
perhaps
he
were
a
jew
like
disraeli
but
they
have
sense
enough
to
know
that
themselves
and
always
choose
a
gentleman
do
they
you
wonderful
girl
do
you
ever
air
these
views
to
my
aunt
they
would
please
her
of
course
not
her
ladyship
is
my
employer
and
she
knows
my
place
i
speak
to
her
when
i
am
spoken
to
you
think
we
on
our
side
are
too
casual
then
that
we
are
letting
our
birthright
slip
from
us
i
believe
you
are
right
yes
you
are
too
sure
of
yourselves
you
think
it
does
not
matter
really
and
so
you
let
the
others
creep
in
with
lies
and
promises
you
let
them
alter
all
the
standards
of
public
honour
without
a
protest
and
so
you
will
gradually
sink
to
the
new
level
too
i
feel
very
sorry
for
england
sometimes
so
do
i
his
face
altered
he
looked
sad
and
in
earnest
and
older
for
the
moment
he
forgot
that
he
was
wasting
valuable
time
in
the
most
agreeable
task
of
exploiting
the
ideas
of
a
new
species
of
female
her
words
had
touched
a
matter
very
near
his
weary
heart
what
can
we
do
he
cried
in
a
tone
of
deep
interest
that
is
the
question
what
can
we
do
you
should
all
wake
up
to
begin
with
like
people
do
when
they
find
that
their
houses
have
caught
fire
at
least
those
whom
the
smoke
has
not
suffocated
first
you
ought
to
make
a
concentrated
determined
effort
to
save
what
you
can
to
build
a
new
shelter
with
admitted
but
how
have
common
sense
taught
from
the
beginning
in
the
schools
the
reasons
of
things
explained
to
the
children
if
you
knew
the
frightful
ignorance
upon
all
the
subjects
that
matter
which
prevails
among
my
class
for
instance
they
have
false
perspectives
about
everything
not
because
they
are
bad
in
the
mass
they
are
much
better
than
you
but
because
they
are
so
frightfully
ignorant
of
the
meaning
of
even
the
little
they
have
learnt
everything
has
a
false
value
for
them
there
is
hardly
a
subject
that
they
can
see
straightly
about
they
are
muffled
and
blighted
with
shams
and
hypocrisies
you
should
address
meetings
among
them
they
would
not
listen
to
me
for
a
moment
the
truths
i
would
tell
them
would
wound
their
vanity
it
would
only
be
in
the
schools
among
the
children
that
anything
effectual
could
be
done
you
think
so
oh
yes
i
know
my
own
sisters
and
brothers
are
examples
i
could
never
teach
them
anything
and
there
are
millions
in
england
just
like
them
good
as
gold
and
stupid
as
owls
it
does
not
sound
hopeful
then
no
the
rust
has
gone
too
far
there
should
have
been
no
education
at
all
or
a
better
one
but
the
present
system
looks
as
if
it
would
swamp
england
if
the
children
are
not
taught
things
soon
you
are
a
tory
it
would
seem
no
i
do
think
i
am
i
think
everyone
has
an
equal
right
but
only
according
to
his
capacity
and
i
certainly
do
think
the
scum
of
the
earth
of
idiots
and
wastrels
have
equal
rights
with
hardworking
sensible
artisans
indeed
no
go
on
i
think
aristocrats
are
things
apart
from
the
opportunities
they
have
had
and
should
know
it
and
keep
up
the
prestige
and
make
their
order
a
great
goal
to
strive
for
you
see
if
they
were
stamped
out
it
would
be
like
cutting
down
all
the
old
trees
in
kensington
gardens
they
could
not
be
produced
again
for
hundreds
of
years
and
all
the
beauty
and
dignity
of
the
gardens
would
be
gone
but
aristocrats
ought
to
act
as
such
and
never
slip
into
the
gutter
there
you
are
certainly
right
i
am
more
than
with
you
but
what
can
one
do
you
should
have
the
courage
of
your
opinions
as
her
ladyship
has
you
only
laugh
when
she
is
saying
splendid
things
sometimes
so
few
of
you
seem
to
have
any
backbone
that
i
have
seen
you
shame
me
her
face
became
filled
with
a
humorous
expression
they
had
been
serious
long
enough
she
thought
his
caught
the
light
of
her
eyes
he
was
intensely
fascinated
you
did
not
of
course
come
from
bindon
green
is
it
you
came
down
from
parnassus
to
teach
us
poor
devils
of
aristocrats
to
stick
to
our
guns
i
will
be
your
first
disciple
priestess
of
wisdom
it
is
five
minutes
to
four
sir
it
will
be
quite
impossible
to
finish
that
pile
of
papers
and
i
come
from
bindon
green
and
i
am
going
back
there
by
the
six
train
from
victoria
to
a
supper
party
at
my
home
that
is
why
my
hair
is
crimped
and
i
have
on
this
new
blouse
he
got
up
and
stood
quite
near
her
and
what
will
you
do
at
the
party
i
ca
see
you
there
i
shall
look
disagreeable
as
i
generally
do
we
shall
have
supper
of
cold
pressed
beef
and
cold
and
and
figs
and
custard
and
some
light
dinner
ale
or
stout
and
cups
of
tea
and
then
when
we
have
finished
that
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
new
nigger
song
records
for
the
gramophone
and
my
brother
bert
will
recite
imitations
of
harry
lauder
and
my
future
miss
mabel
cawber
will
sing
chocolate
soldier
out
of
tune
we
shall
make
a
great
deal
of
noise
and
then
we
shall
push
the
furniture
back
and
dance
the
turkey
trot
and
the
bunny
hug
and
some
of
the
elder
ones
like
my
sister
matilda
will
make
up
a
and
at
about
one
i
can
get
to
bed
it
sounds
perfectly
ideal
but
you
return
from
this
yes
by
an
early
train
i
am
not
a
favourite
at
home
now
will
you
please
begin
again
to
dictate
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
for
a
minute
he
was
not
a
boy
accustomed
only
to
acting
from
inclination
he
knew
very
well
that
it
would
be
much
wiser
now
to
resume
attention
to
business
so
he
took
up
his
memoranda
and
started
once
more
and
for
over
half
an
hour
nothing
but
dictation
passed
between
them
the
pile
of
papers
grew
considerably
less
if
you
care
to
give
me
directions
for
the
rest
quickly
i
will
take
them
down
in
shorthand
and
then
i
could
finish
all
this
some
time
her
ladyship
i
am
sure
would
be
better
pleased
if
her
whole
scheme
is
complete
he
agreed
he
truly
admired
her
perfect
composure
and
common
sense
she
was
so
capable
and
practical
a
person
to
be
relied
upon
he
would
do
as
she
suggested
though
he
had
not
heard
about
dreamland
yet
he
set
his
mind
to
the
affair
on
hand
and
before
the
clock
struck
five
all
was
done
and
ready
for
this
admirable
young
woman
to
type
when
she
had
leisure
and
now
he
took
her
hand
again
a
thousand
thanks
egeria
he
said
you
ought
to
discover
a
likely
lad
and
turn
him
into
the
prime
minister
you
would
make
an
ideal
prime
minister
wife
but
er
do
look
for
him
at
bindon
green
no
i
wo
strobridge
thank
you
for
your
wishes
but
i
have
other
views
i
shall
not
turn
my
into
anything
he
shall
turn
me
into
what
that
is
still
in
the
lap
of
the
gods
and
she
made
him
the
slightest
curtsey
and
went
with
a
bundle
of
receipts
to
the
cupboard
in
the
wall
while
her
eyes
laughed
at
him
over
her
shoulder
as
gerard
strobridge
walked
up
the
shallow
marble
steps
to
his
he
felt
like
a
man
in
a
dream
chapter
xi
what
are
you
thinking
of
lady
garribardine
said
noticing
after
a
little
while
his
preoccupation
that
wretched
charity
has
tired
you
out
dear
boy
i
hope
miss
bush
was
efficient
quite
and
he
lay
back
in
his
very
comfortable
chair
and
devoured
a
bit
of
brown
bread
and
butter
the
whole
thing
is
practically
finished
your
secretary
very
kindly
said
she
would
complete
alone
the
last
directions
which
she
took
down
in
shorthand
then
it
will
be
done
she
is
a
young
person
of
her
word
strobridge
did
not
become
expansive
it
was
fortunate
he
thought
that
he
had
never
yet
shown
any
interest
in
katherine
bush
because
very
little
escaped
his
aunt
perceptions
she
was
already
wondering
what
caused
his
absence
of
mind
he
surely
was
not
being
so
foolish
as
to
have
allowed
himself
to
become
seriously
enamoured
of
l√§o
delemar
her
precious
gerard
this
must
be
ascertained
at
once
l√§o
telephoned
just
now
that
she
would
not
come
to
the
play
really
the
caprices
of
these
pretty
women
are
quite
intolerable
throwing
one
over
at
a
moment
notice
masses
of
selfishness
and
conceit
yes
are
they
languidly
this
did
not
sound
a
lover
disappointment
but
perhaps
he
was
prepared
for
her
news
and
l√§o
proposed
absence
was
what
caused
his
depression
what
excuse
has
she
given
you
he
looked
surprised
none
i
did
not
know
that
she
had
chucked
did
she
give
any
reason
some
nonsense
about
a
friend
of
her
mother
having
turned
up
i
was
so
annoyed
that
i
put
the
receiver
down
you
must
console
me
and
he
leaned
forward
and
took
his
aunt
fat
hand
l√§o
would
never
be
missed
if
a
man
might
count
upon
you
for
his
partner
flatterer
but
she
smiled
complacently
the
colvins
can
both
talk
to
tom
hawthorne
then
i
had
intended
henry
colvin
to
be
my
portion
he
is
a
bright
creature
and
distracted
me
at
dinner
last
week
but
i
am
tired
and
i
always
prefer
you
ah
if
you
had
only
been
my
son
it
would
have
destroyed
the
happiest
of
relationships
in
the
world
and
you
know
it
a
son
you
could
overscold
a
mother
i
could
overrespect
let
us
thank
heaven
for
the
charming
courtesy
tie
that
we
enjoy
i
wish
you
would
have
a
son
though
you
know
i
am
perfectly
indifferent
to
emmeline
boy
i
shall
never
have
any
strobridge
children
seraphim
beatrice
would
faint
at
the
idea
we
only
touched
upon
domestic
pretences
and
got
them
all
over
with
the
very
lightest
effort
in
the
first
week
besides
one
would
not
want
a
thorvil
child
there
is
a
mad
streak
in
the
whole
family
i
have
often
thought
i
am
much
interested
in
heredity
he
did
not
add
how
greatly
the
afternoon
had
augmented
this
interest
yes
did
you
chance
to
notice
my
secretary
hands
the
mother
must
have
had
a
lover
of
course
i
do
think
so
they
seldom
do
in
that
class
they
become
so
intolerably
unattractive
at
once
nothing
human
could
come
up
to
the
scratch
it
is
just
a
freak
or
a
harking
back
many
of
the
exquisitely
aristocratic
features
one
finds
in
old
villagers
for
instance
date
from
the
de
the
whole
question
of
heredity
is
a
frightfully
serious
one
of
course
and
we
are
in
a
stupendous
muddle
at
the
present
time
with
the
inroads
of
the
lord
knows
who
to
muddy
the
stream
do
you
suppose
that
is
the
cause
of
the
dry
rot
which
has
got
into
us
or
is
it
that
we
are
really
rusting
out
it
is
luxury
and
humanitarianism
and
absence
of
national
foes
which
have
sent
us
to
sleep
and
forgetfulness
of
dignity
and
duty
we
eat
the
food
of
those
whose
fathers
fed
in
our
fathers
kitchens
and
not
because
they
are
worthy
and
nice
that
would
be
quite
justifiable
if
so
but
just
because
they
are
rich
and
have
a
superb
chef
or
because
they
are
giving
our
younger
sons
a
lift
in
the
city
i
loathe
all
and
trade
i
am
thankful
that
i
at
least
can
stand
on
my
own
feet
though
i
see
the
sad
decadence
in
all
around
me
but
i
must
not
talk
like
this
it
depresses
and
ages
me
by
the
way
sterling
had
the
impertinence
to
tell
me
that
she
thought
my
new
toup√©es
from
paris
are
too
light
what
do
you
say
he
looked
at
her
critically
at
the
clever
shrewd
painted
old
face
and
the
ridiculous
girlish
wig
and
then
he
kissed
her
hand
again
and
told
her
the
truth
something
about
her
words
touched
him
infinitely
i
adore
very
dark
hair
when
it
is
going
grey
seraphim
i
have
often
thought
how
beautiful
you
would
be
if
you
burnt
all
those
things
your
sense
of
humour
is
so
supreme
they
always
seem
incongruous
i
will
then
this
very
new
year
while
we
are
at
blissington
it
will
be
the
sensation
when
we
return
to
town
sarah
lady
garribardine
with
hair
no
iron
grey
it
will
make
your
eyes
brighter
it
shall
be
done
then
she
laughed
softly
how
goes
it
with
l√§o
you
are
not
in
love
strobridge
shook
his
head
regretfully
alas
not
an
atom
i
fear
it
wo
last
until
the
easter
recess
she
is
artificial
extremely
and
hopelessly
vague
yes
but
quite
charming
beatrice
says
she
pretends
to
be
full
of
sex
and
other
dreadful
natural
things
you
always
had
fruity
tastes
beatrice
avers
my
tastes
fruity
but
are
never
gratified
in
these
modern
days
alas
she
is
quite
wrong
about
l√§o
though
she
is
as
cold
as
ice
she
smiles
with
equal
sweetness
upon
the
waiters
when
we
are
lunching
at
restaurants
she
is
merely
a
lovely
woman
demanding
incense
from
all
things
male
beatrice
said
remember
beatrice
is
not
at
all
dense
no
quite
a
subtle
companion
when
not
composing
odes
or
discussing
the
intensity
of
blue
with
hebe
vermont
are
you
glad
l√§o
is
coming
for
christmas
y
es
i
shall
want
some
of
your
very
best
champagne
you
shall
have
it
and
i
will
try
to
make
things
difficult
for
you
as
a
sort
of
appetiser
i
have
some
kind
of
feeling
that
you
are
depressed
dear
boy
i
am
putting
l√§o
in
the
parrot
suite
it
will
suit
her
admirably
then
they
both
laughed
but
you
are
depressed
a
shadow
of
coming
events
perhaps
not
exactly
disaster
or
i
should
be
what
the
scotch
call
and
he
sighed
he
felt
very
fatigued
and
disturbed
and
he
hardly
knew
what
lady
garribardine
did
not
press
the
matter
she
had
enormous
tact
delemar
at
that
moment
was
lying
upon
her
sofa
in
a
ravishing
saffron
gauze
teagown
smoking
scented
cigarettes
while
she
discussed
her
heart
secrets
with
a
dearest
friend
gerard
is
madly
in
love
with
me
agnes
i
hardly
know
what
to
do
about
it
i
have
chucked
for
on
purpose
to
give
him
a
setback
it
will
be
most
cosy
dining
here
alone
with
bobbie
moreland
and
jimmy
and
me
you
were
quite
right
darling
poor
bobbie
back
from
that
horrible
india
where
he
has
been
for
a
year
of
course
i
could
not
refuse
him
but
lady
garribardine
is
wild
it
would
not
do
to
offend
her
really
l√§o
sweet
you
must
be
penitent
and
send
her
some
flowers
if
katherine
bush
had
been
there
she
would
have
seen
a
strong
likeness
in
delemar
to
her
future
mabel
cawber
her
cigarette
ash
was
knocked
off
in
almost
as
dainty
a
fashion
as
that
lady
employed
in
using
her
spoon
delemar
ceased
remembering
that
she
was
a
beautiful
woman
and
must
act
accordingly
the
only
difference
between
them
was
that
mabel
cawber
forgot
that
she
was
a
perfect
lady
and
was
determined
that
no
one
should
miss
this
fact
if
she
could
help
it
their
souls
were
on
a
par
or
whatever
animating
principle
did
duty
as
a
soul
in
each
delemar
returned
to
the
subject
of
gerard
with
a
sigh
telling
her
friend
agnes
the
most
intimate
things
he
had
said
to
her
and
giving
her
pleasing
descriptions
of
her
own
emotions
too
gerard
was
a
feather
for
any
woman
cap
and
agnes
should
know
how
crazily
in
love
he
was
with
her
i
think
he
do
something
desperate
darling
if
i
do
give
way
soon
i
wish
men
were
like
us
do
you
one
must
please
the
creatures
or
they
would
not
stay
yes
but
oh
is
it
a
shocking
bore
that
part
if
they
only
knew
katherine
bush
meanwhile
was
arriving
at
laburnum
villa
where
a
crowd
of
sisters
and
friends
welcomed
her
home
fresh
from
the
entrancing
fencing
match
with
gerard
strobridge
their
chaff
and
badinage
sounded
extremely
bald
but
among
them
poor
gladys
was
silent
and
sat
with
flushed
cheeks
and
overbright
eyes
looking
at
katherine
i
want
to
talk
to
you
glad
this
latter
said
kindly
lady
garribardine
has
given
me
ten
pounds
to
get
a
real
evening
frock
with
i
must
have
it
to
take
down
to
blissington
for
christmas
we
go
week
but
can
i
get
it
in
the
time
gladys
was
all
interest
at
once
clothes
were
a
real
passion
for
her
she
devised
something
pretty
but
five
pounds
would
be
quite
enough
katherine
had
better
have
two
dresses
a
black
and
that
lovely
new
shade
of
mauve
i
have
the
black
the
very
simplest
that
there
can
be
if
you
know
of
one
of
your
hands
who
could
make
it
for
me
i
leave
it
entirely
to
you
gladys
was
delighted
and
then
her
large
prominent
eyes
grew
haunted
and
wistful
i
like
awfully
to
talk
to
you
kitten
she
said
may
i
come
to
your
room
permission
was
given
and
they
all
went
to
supper
it
was
exactly
as
katherine
had
described
it
that
afternoon
and
prodgers
was
there
in
his
best
frock
coat
more
full
of
what
miss
ethel
bush
called
swank
mixed
with
discomfort
than
katherine
had
ever
known
him
if
she
had
not
felt
so
deeply
that
these
people
were
her
own
flesh
and
blood
she
could
have
been
amused
by
the
whole
thing
nothing
could
equal
the
condescension
of
miss
cawber
lady
garribardine
name
was
not
entirely
unknown
to
her
although
to
be
sure
it
was
not
in
the
same
class
as
that
of
the
duchess
of
dashington
lady
hebe
vermont
or
any
of
the
smart
set
but
still
it
had
chanced
once
now
and
then
to
have
appeared
in
the
society
column
of
the
she
rather
thought
as
the
patroness
of
some
dull
old
political
thing
and
yes
more
recently
in
connection
with
those
which
miss
cawber
was
dying
to
hear
the
details
of
perhaps
katherine
could
gratify
his
need
did
hebe
vermont
look
a
dream
as
sicchy
and
lord
aldens
as
cupid
my
they
must
have
been
a
pair
i
always
do
say
to
fred
when
we
meet
them
at
church
parade
of
a
sunday
that
they
are
the
real
thing
katherine
for
once
took
up
the
gauntlet
while
one
of
her
sphinxlike
smiles
hovered
about
her
mouth
hebe
vermont
played
psyche
if
that
is
who
you
mean
by
but
who
is
lord
aldens
mabel
john
aldens
who
acted
cupid
is
an
he
is
a
baron
son
his
father
is
lord
hexam
mabel
reddened
while
maintaining
for
the
most
part
a
rather
chilling
silence
with
her
katherine
had
never
before
deliberately
crossed
swords
she
felt
indignant
a
paid
companion
to
try
to
make
her
look
foolish
before
the
others
she
who
had
never
done
a
stroke
of
work
even
in
a
business
house
in
her
life
she
would
have
to
put
this
future
in
her
place
and
no
mistake
her
manner
plainly
showed
that
katherine
was
in
disgrace
as
she
answered
loftily
really
i
ought
to
know
my
father
was
a
great
friend
of
his
father
and
often
went
to
their
place
in
what
capacity
mabel
katherine
smiled
we
none
of
us
remember
your
father
but
liv
and
dev
told
me
once
when
i
asked
them
that
he
had
been
an
at
canford
and
crin
the
alden
solicitors
and
then
passed
the
examinations
from
what
i
learned
about
his
sort
of
people
by
living
among
them
for
a
month
i
do
expect
lord
hexam
was
very
intimate
with
cawber
but
we
are
all
acquainted
in
the
same
way
are
we
tild
you
remember
hearing
of
this
family
from
father
who
was
their
butcher
for
the
river
house
at
maidenhead
mabel
glared
this
was
sheer
impertinence
her
queenship
of
this
circle
was
not
being
treated
with
proper
respect
how
vulgar
of
katherine
she
thought
mabel
refinement
was
almost
of
the
degree
of
the
boston
lady
who
insisted
upon
the
piano
limbs
being
put
into
pantaloons
with
frills
she
would
hardly
have
spoken
of
a
butcher
she
felt
particularly
annoyed
now
also
because
the
clerk
episode
was
a
fact
which
she
thought
was
quite
unknown
the
solicitorship
at
bindon
green
having
gloriously
advanced
the
family
fortunes
poor
matilda
was
quite
upset
and
reproached
katherine
when
she
succeeded
in
getting
her
into
a
corner
alone
whatever
did
you
speak
to
mabel
like
that
for
kitten
and
i
am
sure
we
need
not
tell
everyone
about
grandpa
since
he
did
not
live
here
her
nonsense
makes
me
feel
quite
sick
tild
she
is
always
pretending
some
ridiculous
knowledge
and
acquaintanceship
with
the
aristocracy
she
gets
all
the
names
wrong
and
gives
herself
away
all
the
time
it
does
her
good
to
be
found
out
once
in
a
way
matilda
could
bear
this
side
of
the
affair
but
resented
the
allusion
to
the
butcher
with
undiminished
fervour
oh
what
awful
snobs
you
all
are
katherine
exclaimed
exasperated
out
of
her
amused
tolerance
at
last
i
am
not
the
least
ashamed
of
him
i
am
proud
on
the
contrary
he
was
honest
and
made
money
why
are
you
and
mabel
and
all
your
friends
such
absurd
shams
tild
there
is
nothing
disgraceful
in
being
lower
middle
class
it
is
honourable
and
worthy
why
on
earth
pretend
to
belong
to
another
when
anyone
who
knows
can
see
it
is
untrue
or
if
you
hate
your
real
station
then
do
as
i
am
doing
educate
yourself
out
of
it
educate
myself
out
of
it
matilda
was
incensed
why
i
sure
we
are
all
as
fairly
educated
as
any
ladies
need
be
this
point
of
view
naturally
ended
the
argument
for
katherine
she
could
only
smile
again
all
right
it
is
your
birthday
dear
old
tild
so
i
wo
quarrel
with
you
by
the
way
where
is
bob
hartley
i
do
see
him
here
the
fianc√©
of
gladys
was
prevented
from
coming
by
a
severe
cold
she
was
informed
and
so
the
evening
passed
with
the
bunny
hug
and
games
and
the
gramophone
shouted
forth
its
nigger
songs
in
which
they
all
joined
has
it
been
too
lovely
kitten
matilda
said
affectionately
her
whilom
indignation
fled
as
they
walked
up
the
narrow
stairs
i
never
had
such
a
perfect
birthday
party
and
i
am
sure
you
could
not
have
had
a
more
refined
enjoyable
evening
not
in
any
home
katherine
kissed
her
as
she
turned
into
her
room
you
dear
old
tild
she
said
and
then
presently
gladys
came
in
katherine
was
seated
in
a
shrunk
which
she
had
left
behind
and
had
lighted
a
fire
in
the
attic
grate
the
two
girls
looked
at
one
another
and
then
gladys
was
asked
to
sit
down
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
and
katherine
voice
was
deep
and
level
you
would
not
have
to
say
it
if
you
had
not
always
been
such
a
fool
my
poor
glad
you
have
got
into
trouble
of
course
and
bob
hartley
is
not
playing
the
game
gladys
burst
into
passionate
sobs
however
did
you
guess
kitten
why
tild
does
know
a
thing
most
likely
not
well
what
do
you
want
him
to
do
marry
you
why
of
course
katherine
that
is
what
he
promised
most
solemnly
beforehand
at
brighton
you
know
it
is
his
mother
who
has
kept
him
back
his
aunt
eliza
with
whom
we
stayed
is
quite
willing
for
me
i
am
sure
i
as
good
as
him
anyway
further
sobs
oh
that
part
does
not
matter
a
bit
as
good
or
not
as
good
these
awful
men
like
bob
hartley
always
seduce
women
with
promises
solemn
promises
of
matrimony
and
that
sort
of
stuff
if
they
meant
them
they
would
not
forestall
matters
vile
brutes
there
is
no
good
in
abusing
bob
kitten
he
has
always
meant
kind
it
is
his
mother
i
tell
you
has
got
at
him
does
she
know
oh
my
i
hope
not
no
one
knows
but
you
and
bob
have
you
told
him
he
must
marry
you
at
once
yes
i
implored
him
to
on
my
bended
knees
and
he
has
refused
yes
he
ca
break
his
mother
heart
he
says
and
speaks
of
going
to
australia
very
well
go
to
bed
now
dear
i
will
see
him
and
see
what
i
can
do
i
think
he
will
marry
you
next
week
perhaps
after
all
you
must
undertake
the
inventing
of
a
reason
for
the
suddenness
to
the
family
if
i
accomplish
the
fact
go
now
dear
i
want
to
think
gladys
sobbed
her
gratitude
and
you
do
believe
i
am
really
bad
kitten
do
you
indeed
i
never
wanted
anything
but
bob
we
went
to
the
theatre
one
night
and
had
a
bit
of
supper
and
afterwards
i
was
so
afraid
he
would
be
off
to
carry
green
if
i
did
not
do
as
he
wished
two
great
tears
grew
in
katherine
beautiful
eyes
and
rolled
slowly
down
her
white
cheeks
i
think
most
men
are
devils
glad
but
of
the
women
are
fools
and
fools
always
have
to
pay
the
price
of
everything
in
life
a
woman
always
loses
a
man
if
she
gives
way
to
him
against
her
conscience
you
felt
you
were
sinning
all
the
time
i
suppose
why
of
course
kitten
i
really
a
good
girl
then
what
else
could
you
expect
if
you
feel
you
are
doing
wrong
you
must
know
you
will
be
punished
that
attitude
of
yours
was
bound
to
have
drawn
this
i
tell
you
glad
no
one
of
your
sort
can
afford
to
step
one
foot
aside
out
of
the
narrow
path
you
as
you
call
it
for
love
it
gave
you
no
pleasure
and
you
have
practically
lost
bob
remember
this
and
never
give
way
to
him
in
anything
again
why
did
you
have
the
tears
in
your
eyes
katherine
you
so
cold
it
was
stupid
of
me
but
the
incredible
pitifulness
of
some
parts
of
life
touched
me
for
a
moment
now
go
to
bed
dear
and
keep
your
courage
up
do
let
tild
know
it
would
break
her
heart
and
think
of
mabel
oh
my
wailed
gladys
and
went
towards
the
door
katherine
jumped
up
suddenly
and
gave
her
the
note
which
had
been
lying
under
a
box
of
matches
on
the
imitation
oak
here
gladys
get
the
little
black
frock
for
me
just
as
cheaply
as
ever
you
can
lady
garribardine
will
never
know
what
it
cost
she
is
accustomed
to
pay
forty
or
fifty
pounds
for
her
evening
dresses
and
you
keep
all
the
rest
if
if
bob
should
not
be
reasonable
it
might
be
useful
for
you
to
have
some
money
that
you
need
not
account
to
tild
for
i
know
she
looks
after
everything
that
you
have
got
but
you
will
make
him
katherine
oh
you
will
if
you
can
you
are
so
clever
and
he
be
in
the
train
if
you
go
by
the
early
one
have
him
alone
very
well
bring
me
up
a
slice
of
bread
or
anything
you
can
find
when
you
first
go
down
i
ca
stand
the
family
breakfast
and
i
will
just
rush
off
by
the
what
she
said
to
bob
hartley
she
never
told
anyone
but
it
was
extraordinarily
effectual
it
contained
biting
scorn
and
heavy
threats
among
them
his
chief
should
know
of
his
conduct
that
very
day
before
he
could
possibly
sneak
off
to
australia
unless
he
went
and
got
a
special
license
the
registry
office
would
do
very
well
but
by
the
following
wednesday
gladys
must
be
his
wife
or
katherine
scorpion
whip
would
fall
he
should
be
thrashed
by
fred
and
bert
and
charlie
prodgers
too
she
would
have
no
mercy
upon
him
none
at
all
you
poor
mean
sanctimonious
miserable
cur
were
some
of
her
parting
words
to
him
come
into
this
telegraph
office
with
me
and
send
this
wire
to
gladys
this
minute
you
honour
me
by
marrying
me
on
tuesday
if
so
get
ready
you
can
pretend
you
had
a
secret
wedding
to
save
expense
and
tell
them
at
home
on
christmas
day
hartley
was
a
thorough
coward
his
plans
were
not
matured
enough
yet
to
go
to
australia
and
his
present
berth
was
a
good
one
so
he
felt
it
was
wiser
to
give
in
and
do
what
he
was
bid
and
presently
katherine
got
into
a
taxi
and
was
whirled
back
to
berkeley
square
where
later
in
the
day
her
sister
telegram
of
rapturous
thanks
came
to
her
but
when
she
was
alone
that
night
by
her
comfortable
fire
she
let
a
volume
of
flaubert
drop
on
her
knees
and
looked
into
the
coals
her
thoughts
going
back
to
the
painful
incident
here
was
a
plain
indication
of
the
working
of
laws
shown
in
her
own
case
and
the
difference
between
it
and
that
of
gladys
alas
the
piteous
fate
of
weaklings
and
then
she
set
herself
to
analyse
things
whether
the
accepted
idea
of
morality
is
right
or
is
wrong
of
god
or
of
man
those
who
break
its
laws
are
certainly
drawing
to
themselves
the
frightfully
strong
current
of
millions
of
people
disapproval
and
so
must
run
great
risk
of
punishment
thus
she
mused
and
then
her
eyes
grew
wide
as
she
gazed
into
the
glowing
coals
if
some
day
she
should
have
to
pay
some
price
for
her
own
deviation
from
recognized
standards
chapter
xii
christmas
day
fell
upon
a
tuesday
in
and
on
the
saturday
before
katherine
bush
accompanied
her
employer
and
the
two
dogs
down
to
blissington
in
the
motor
she
had
only
been
in
one
for
short
drives
in
the
bois
with
lord
algy
so
to
tear
through
the
frozen
country
was
a
great
joy
to
her
although
not
possessing
proper
wraps
she
was
rather
cold
you
must
have
a
fur
coat
miss
bush
i
am
greatly
annoyed
that
i
did
not
remark
that
you
were
insufficiently
clad
before
we
started
here
crouch
down
under
this
rug
and
there
is
an
extra
one
at
my
feet
you
must
wrap
round
you
katherine
was
grateful
stirling
must
find
you
some
warm
garment
of
mine
while
we
are
at
blissington
i
have
no
patience
with
idiots
who
deliberately
take
cold
katherine
agreed
with
her
do
you
know
the
english
country
or
are
you
quite
a
cockney
girl
she
was
then
asked
no
i
hardly
know
it
at
all
i
know
brighton
and
a
lot
of
seaside
places
but
we
never
chanced
to
go
to
the
country
for
our
holidays
it
is
a
wonderful
place
the
english
country
the
most
beautiful
in
the
world
i
think
it
will
interest
me
immensely
to
hear
your
impressions
of
it
after
a
week
you
must
tell
me
i
shall
be
very
pleased
to
do
so
we
pass
windsor
you
must
go
over
it
some
day
it
is
only
twenty
miles
from
blissington
are
you
interested
in
historical
associations
extremely
any
places
which
are
saturated
with
the
evolution
of
man
and
nations
are
interesting
i
think
i
am
afraid
i
would
not
care
to
go
to
australia
or
a
new
country
lady
garribardine
turned
and
looked
at
her
secretary
the
creature
evidently
had
a
brain
and
this
would
be
a
good
opportunity
to
draw
her
out
you
feel
the
force
of
tradition
then
oh
yes
in
everything
it
acts
for
generations
in
the
blood
it
makes
people
do
all
sorts
of
things
good
and
bad
quite
without
reason
lady
garribardine
chuckled
she
loved
discussions
how
does
it
act
in
yourself
for
instance
i
have
tried
to
stop
its
action
in
myself
because
i
saw
the
effects
of
the
traditions
of
my
class
in
my
brothers
and
sisters
and
how
stultifying
it
was
you
certainly
seem
to
have
emerged
from
them
in
an
extraordinary
manner
how
did
you
set
about
it
katherine
thought
a
little
and
then
answered
deliberately
i
always
wanted
to
know
the
reason
why
of
everything
and
i
soon
felt
sure
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
chance
but
that
everything
which
happened
was
part
of
some
scheme
and
i
always
desired
to
be
able
to
distinguish
between
appearance
and
reality
and
i
got
to
understand
that
personal
emotion
distorts
all
reality
and
creates
appearance
and
so
i
began
to
try
to
dissociate
things
from
personal
emotion
in
my
judgments
of
them
yes
but
how
about
tradition
tradition
suggested
certain
views
and
actions
to
me
but
looked
at
without
emotion
i
saw
that
they
were
foolish
i
analysed
my
and
sisters
ideas
and
instincts
because
i
wanted
to
see
if
what
i
did
not
like
in
them
was
inevitable
in
myself
too
from
the
force
of
tradition
or
if
there
was
any
way
to
get
rid
of
stupidities
and
you
found
of
course
that
everything
even
instincts
can
be
eradicated
if
only
their
origins
can
be
traced
and
the
will
is
strong
enough
to
overcome
them
yes
everything
depends
upon
will
and
you
found
time
for
all
this
reasoning
while
you
kept
the
accounts
at
the
lady
garribardine
eyebrows
ran
quizzically
up
into
her
forehead
and
there
was
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
she
was
greatly
amused
yes
in
the
evenings
no
wonder
you
have
emerged
you
do
not
allow
yourself
to
have
any
emotions
then
katherine
looked
away
demurely
i
try
not
to
indulge
in
them
it
is
more
prudent
to
watch
their
action
in
others
have
you
ever
been
in
love
child
it
depends
upon
what
one
calls
love
the
tone
was
dignified
katherine
did
not
think
this
quite
a
fair
question
lady
garribardine
laughed
appreciatively
you
are
quite
right
i
should
not
have
asked
you
that
since
we
were
up
upon
a
plane
of
discussion
in
which
even
women
do
not
lie
to
one
another
if
your
ladyship
will
permit
me
to
say
so
women
have
very
little
notion
of
truth
i
think
oh
that
is
too
bad
you
must
always
stand
up
for
your
sex
forgive
me
for
differing
but
i
should
be
acting
from
good
nature
in
that
case
not
from
justice
lady
garribardine
was
delighted
so
you
think
we
are
not
truthful
as
a
company
oh
no
we
have
no
love
of
abstract
truth
truth
for
itself
when
we
are
truthful
in
our
general
dealings
with
people
it
is
either
because
we
have
decent
characters
or
religious
views
or
for
our
own
ends
not
from
a
detached
love
of
truth
what
a
cynic
and
how
about
men
a
man
is
truthful
because
he
likes
truth
and
to
tell
lies
he
feels
would
degrade
himself
and
yet
men
always
lie
to
women
have
you
remarked
that
girl
yes
that
seems
to
be
the
one
exception
in
their
standard
of
truth
how
do
you
account
for
this
have
you
found
the
why
of
this
peculiarity
it
seems
presumptuous
of
me
to
give
my
views
to
your
ladyship
i
think
i
am
the
best
judge
of
that
matter
and
lady
garribardine
frowned
a
little
i
asked
a
question
katherine
answered
then
immediately
she
was
not
quite
pleased
with
herself
for
her
last
remark
it
had
laid
her
open
to
a
snub
original
man
had
no
regard
for
women
they
were
as
the
animals
to
him
he
would
not
have
felt
degraded
in
lying
to
animals
because
such
a
thing
could
not
occur
he
would
not
consult
animals
he
simply
ordered
them
well
then
as
soon
as
he
had
to
consider
women
at
all
he
found
it
easier
to
lie
to
them
because
of
their
want
of
understanding
and
chattering
tongues
and
as
he
did
not
consider
that
they
were
his
equals
in
anything
no
degradation
was
entailed
in
making
things
easy
for
himself
with
them
by
lying
to
them
how
ingenuous
that
is
how
it
seems
to
me
and
so
things
have
gone
on
tradition
and
instinct
again
until
even
now
when
man
is
forced
to
consider
women
the
original
instinct
is
still
there
making
him
feel
that
it
does
not
matter
lying
to
them
i
believe
you
are
right
you
are
not
a
suffragette
oh
no
i
like
women
to
advance
in
everything
but
unless
you
could
destroy
their
dramatic
instinct
and
hysteria
i
think
it
would
be
a
pity
for
a
country
if
they
had
votes
you
despise
women
and
respect
men
then
not
at
all
it
would
be
like
despising
bread
and
respecting
water
i
only
despise
weakness
in
either
sex
well
miss
bush
i
think
you
have
a
mind
i
feel
that
ninety
pounds
a
year
and
drudgery
is
the
right
thing
for
you
what
is
to
be
done
katherine
gave
one
of
her
rare
soft
laughs
believe
me
madam
the
lessons
i
am
learning
in
your
ladyship
service
are
worth
more
to
me
than
my
salary
i
am
quite
contented
and
enjoy
my
drudgery
so
you
are
learning
lessons
are
you
lady
garribardine
chuckled
again
of
the
world
the
flesh
or
the
devil
a
little
of
all
three
perhaps
katherine
answered
with
shy
demureness
look
here
young
woman
i
have
remarked
more
than
once
that
you
possess
a
quality
almost
unknown
in
females
out
of
a
hundred
and
in
the
middle
classes
a
fine
sense
of
humour
it
is
quite
out
of
place
and
like
the
royal
rose
imprinted
upon
the
real
left
shoulder
i
expect
we
shall
discover
presently
that
the
butcher
and
baker
forebears
are
all
moonshine
and
that
you
are
a
princess
in
see
that
is
windsor
is
it
fine
ah
yes
cried
katherine
it
makes
one
think
they
were
rushing
along
the
road
from
staines
where
they
could
see
the
splendid
pile
standing
out
against
the
sky
all
those
old
grey
stones
put
together
by
brutes
and
fools
and
brains
and
force
i
will
take
you
there
myself
some
day
i
shall
love
to
go
then
her
ladyship
became
quite
silent
as
was
her
custom
when
she
felt
inclined
so
to
be
the
obligation
to
make
conversation
never
weighed
upon
her
this
made
her
a
delightful
companion
they
arrived
at
the
park
gates
of
blissington
court
about
one
and
katherine
bush
felt
again
a
delightful
excitement
she
had
never
seen
a
big
english
country
home
except
in
pictures
the
came
out
he
was
an
old
man
in
a
quaint
livery
i
can
not
stand
the
untidy
females
escaping
from
the
washtub
who
attend
to
most
people
gates
this
family
of
peterson
have
opened
those
of
blissington
for
two
hundred
years
and
have
always
worn
the
same
sort
of
livery
from
father
to
son
their
intelligence
is
at
the
lowest
ebb
and
they
make
capital
there
is
generally
a
boy
or
two
to
carry
on
the
business
the
women
folk
keep
out
of
sight
it
is
a
tradition
in
the
family
they
take
a
pride
in
it
i
give
them
unusually
high
wages
and
whatever
else
grows
more
and
more
idiotic
the
instinct
survives
in
full
force
there
are
three
lodges
all
kept
by
petersons
how
wonderful
said
katherine
good
day
jacob
the
family
well
jane
quite
recovered
from
the
eh
quite
well
your
ladyship
and
the
old
man
wandering
eyes
were
fixed
in
adoration
upon
his
mistress
face
and
your
ladyship
godchild
sarah
is
growing
that
knowing
my
daughter
can
hardly
keep
her
from
the
front
garden
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
i
shall
be
stopping
in
to
see
you
tell
peterson
this
is
my
new
secretary
miss
bush
jacob
you
will
know
her
again
wo
you
i
try
to
your
ladyship
a
little
doubtfully
and
he
bowed
deeply
as
the
motor
rolled
on
along
a
beautiful
drive
through
the
vast
park
with
its
groups
of
graceful
deer
peering
at
them
from
under
the
giant
trees
katherine
was
taking
in
the
whole
scene
the
winter
day
and
the
brown
earth
and
the
blue
sky
and
the
beauty
of
it
all
yes
this
sort
of
thing
was
what
must
be
hers
some
day
when
she
had
fitted
herself
to
possess
it
they
came
to
another
gate
and
yet
another
iron
ones
with
no
lodges
and
then
they
swept
through
a
wide
avenue
with
sprucely
kept
edges
and
so
on
up
to
the
front
door
it
was
a
long
irregular
building
which
katherine
saw
principally
built
in
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
added
to
from
time
to
time
it
was
very
picturesque
and
when
they
were
inside
the
hall
proved
to
be
very
fine
it
was
huge
and
square
and
panelled
with
some
good
grinling
gibbons
carving
and
quantities
of
indifferently
painted
ancestors
for
the
most
part
in
stiff
peers
they
had
been
a
distinguished
crew
not
of
the
type
these
are
my
people
miss
bush
not
garribardines
her
ladyship
said
pointing
to
the
portraits
they
were
not
handsome
as
you
see
and
evidently
did
not
encourage
the
best
artists
the
few
who
did
are
in
the
other
rooms
and
the
picture
gallery
come
we
will
go
straight
in
to
lunch
i
am
as
hungry
as
a
schoolboy
you
will
lunch
with
me
bronson
had
gone
down
much
earlier
and
was
awaiting
them
with
two
footmen
as
dignified
as
usual
the
was
in
a
panelled
passage
to
the
right
and
was
a
long
low
room
of
much
earlier
date
a
relic
incorporated
later
in
the
present
structure
katherine
was
told
it
was
perfectly
beautiful
she
thought
with
its
deep
brown
oak
wax
polished
to
the
highest
lustre
and
its
curtains
of
splendid
venetian
velvet
in
faded
crimson
and
green
on
a
white
satin
ground
all
harmonious
with
age
and
mellowing
i
had
a
terrible
struggle
to
oust
the
victorian
horrors
i
had
been
brought
up
with
and
which
had
insinuated
themselves
as
all
vulgar
things
do
into
almost
every
room
among
their
betters
taste
was
quite
dead
sixty
years
ago
in
my
father
day
i
had
to
combat
sentiment
in
myself
and
ruthlessly
condemn
the
whole
lot
it
is
most
beautiful
katherine
admiration
was
indeed
sincere
yes
it
has
been
a
great
pleasure
to
me
getting
it
perfect
you
shall
see
the
whole
house
presently
but
now
food
is
the
only
important
bronson
i
distrust
the
look
of
that
ham
souffl√©
are
you
sure
it
has
not
been
kept
waiting
a
second
or
two
alters
its
consistency
take
it
away
at
once
man
with
an
indignant

never

so
precarious
a

again
for
arrivals
by

very
good
your
ladyship
one
can
eat
bread
and
cheese
but
one
can
not
stomach
an
indifferent
souffl√©
it
is
like
an
emotional
woman
its
charm
is
just
as
capricious
and
just
as
ephemeral
the
rest
of
the
lunch
was
to
her
taste
and
no
further
disapproval
was
expressed
it
was
the
first
time
katherine
had
broken
bread
with
her
mistress
or
indeed
had
even
assisted
at
a
whole
luncheon
coffee
was
the
extent
of
her
knowledge
hitherto
it
interested
her
to
see
the
varied
dishes
to
watch
the
perfect
service
the
style
of
the
placing
and
removing
of
the
plates
the
rapidity
and
noiselessness
of
it
all
she
thought
of
the
pressed
beef
and
the
stout
and
the
and
the
frightful
untidiness
of
everything
at
laburnum
villa
that
was
the
strange
difference
the
utter
want
of
method
and
order
which
always
rendered
the
home
table
a
mass
of
litter
and
miscellaneous
implements
towards
the
end
of
a
repast
plates
and
cups
pushed
here
and
there
and
everywhere
how
very
good
to
be
out
of
it
all
to
her
great
surprise
her
ladyship
drank
beer
clear
golden
stuff
poured
from
a
lovely
crystal
and
silver
jug
into
a
chased
silver
tankard
the
best
beverage
in
christendom
that
epicure
said
as
she
quaffed
it
have
some
miss
bush
you
are
young
enough
to
have
no
dread
of
gout
it
is
a
vice
with
me
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
for
my
rheumatism
and
yet
i
can
not
resist
the
temptation
the
day
i
return
home
i
must
fall
to
my
tankard
bronson
removes
the
accursed
thing
to
the
sideboard
out
of
sight
and
i
keep
up
my
courage
on
ridiculously
thin
zeltinger
katherine
tasted
it
it
was
delicious
and
as
different
from
what
she
knew
as
beer
as
the
tea
had
been
from
her
original
idea
of
tea
is
it
a
heavenly
drink
girl
i
am
glad
to
see
you
like
it
then
lady
garribardine
chatted
on
giving
crisp
witty
descriptions
of
the
village
and
the
inhabitants
in
language
which
would
often
have
shocked
the
genteel
sensibilities
of
mabel
cawber
but
the
tones
of
her
voice
whether
loud
or
soft
were
the
dulcet
tones
of
angels
she
had
indeed
that
excellent
thing
in
woman
katherine
workroom
was
the
old
schoolroom
up
in
a
wing
which
contained
rooms
as
ancient
as
the
and
her
bedroom
adjoined
it
and
from
this
a
little
passage
led
to
a
narrow
staircase
going
down
to
a
door
which
opened
into
the
small
enclosed
rose
garden
up
another
set
of
steps
from
her
corridor
you
were
brought
into
the
splendid
gallery
which
ran
round
two
sides
of
the
hall
and
into
which
her
ladyship
own
rooms
gave
but
in
katherine
corner
she
was
isolated
and
could
come
and
go
abroad
without
ever
passing
the
general
living
rooms
what
an
advantage
she
felt
and
when
later
in
the
afternoon
her
things
were
unpacked
and
she
was
sitting
before
a
glorious
wood
fire
in
the
old
chimney
sniffing
the
scent
of
the
burning
logs
and
taking
in
the
whole
picture
of
quaint
chintz
and
shining
oak
she
felt
a
sense
of
contentment
and
satisfaction
fate
was
indeed
treating
her
handsomely
chapter
xiii
katherine
saw
nothing
more
of
her
employer
on
the
saturday
but
on
the
sunday
morning
a
message
came
to
say
she
would
expect
her
to
go
to
church
with
her
as
no
mention
of
church
had
ever
been
made
in
london
katherine
was
quite
unprepared
for
this
and
was
obliged
to
scurry
to
be
ready
in
the
country
and
at
one
home
one
must
always
go
to
church
miss
bush
she
was
informed
when
they
were
in
the
motor
it
is
tradition
again
then
there
was
silence
until
they
were
almost
at
the
door
it
is
rather
a
fine
little
church
with
some
good
tombs
of
my
ancestors
in
it
prolific
people
who
seemed
to
have
married
either
widows
with
like
proclivities
or
to
have
commemorated
their
own
marital
there
are
two
very
curious
monuments
one
of
a
marriage
with
about
seven
or
eight
children
behind
both
the
man
and
the
woman
proofs
of
their
former
activities
and
another
of
a
second
pair
with
numerous
olive
branches
owned
mutually
they
were
of
an
enchanting
ingenuousness
in
those
days
you
will
face
these
figures
during
the
sermon
you
can
examine
them
a
not
unpleasing
pastime
i
used
to
find
it
in
my
youth
lady
garribardine
walk
from
the
church
was
a
kind
of
triumphal
progress
all
the
faces
of
the
clustering
local
groups
beamed
with
joy
and
welcome
for
her
she
had
a
word
and
a
nod
for
everyone
and
to
katherine
amusement
stopped
threateningly
in
front
of
a
biggish
boy
who
was
handling
a
bandanna
handkerchief
if
i
hear
one
sniffle
thomas
knoughton
out
you
go
it
is
a
habit
you
have
got
into
flaunting
these
colds
every
time
i
get
home
i
wo
put
up
with
it
very
good
yer
leddyship
the
boy
returned
stolidly
pulling
his
forelock
it
was
evident
to
be
seen
that
their
lady
bountiful
was
held
in
deep
respect
by
her
tenants
the
service
was
quite
cheerful
and
merry
with
christmas
music
from
a
fine
organ
one
of
the
patroness
gifts
and
the
monuments
were
certainly
diverting
henry
vii
and
edward
vi
costumes
carved
in
stone
adorning
women
and
grave
men
when
they
came
out
a
number
of
the
local
farmers
and
their
wives
had
to
be
greeted
lady
garribardine
seemed
to
know
all
their
domestic
affairs
and
to
wield
an
absolute
dominion
over
them
she
was
kindly
and
autocratic
and
not
in
the
least
condescending
they
evidently
loved
her
dearly
katherine
stood
by
respectfully
and
once
or
twice
her
mistress
said
this
is
my
new
secretary
miss
bush
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
apparently
the
bounties
and
teas
and
christmas
feasting
being
prepared
for
everyone
knew
no
bounds
by
what
katherine
heard
discussed
as
they
motored
back
her
ladyship
said
now
before
lunch
i
want
you
for
an
hour
to
explain
the
country
duties
to
you
as
i
explained
the
london
ones
and
this
afternoon
you
must
see
over
the
house
illingworth
will
show
you
round
and
i
have
to
start
very
early
to
see
my
poor
people
you
have
those
lists
copied
out
have
you
not
katherine
lunched
alone
in
her
and
before
her
inspection
of
the
house
began
she
went
for
a
little
walk
the
old
park
delighted
her
the
sense
that
it
was
not
public
property
gave
her
pleasure
she
could
go
for
miles
it
seemed
upon
the
soft
turf
or
along
the
smooth
avenues
without
meeting
a
soul
there
was
something
in
her
nature
which
enjoyed
this
isolation
from
the
common
herd
i
believe
if
it
were
mine
i
should
dislike
even
a
right
of
way
she
said
to
herself
she
stopped
close
to
some
deer
they
were
so
tame
they
hardly
started
from
her
the
whole
place
when
she
came
to
a
rising
ground
and
could
look
back
at
the
house
exalted
her
in
some
strange
way
the
atmosphere
of
it
was
so
different
from
anything
which
she
had
been
accustomed
to
it
was
no
wonder
that
people
living
in
such
houses
should
have
wider
scopes
of
imagination
than
the
inhabitants
of
bindon
green
with
every
little
villa
watching
the
habits
of
its
neighbour
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
study
lady
garribardine
methods
with
her
people
for
her
own
future
guidance
the
perfect
certainty
with
which
she
looked
forward
to
obtaining
the
same
sort
of
situation
was
almost
sublime
when
her
inspection
of
the
house
came
her
feelings
were
further
stirred
there
was
a
great
bump
of
veneration
in
her
for
ancient
things
her
artistic
sensibilities
which
had
not
yet
been
as
awakened
as
her
practical
ones
now
began
to
assert
themselves
she
felt
she
must
read
books
upon
architecture
and
learn
the
dates
and
styles
of
furniture
she
admired
but
she
was
conscious
that
she
had
not
yet
sufficiently
cultivated
critical
faculties
to
appreciate
fully
her
tour
opened
a
new
field
of
study
for
her
a
new
consciousness
of
her
own
ignorance
and
a
new
determination
to
acquire
the
necessary
knowledge
on
these
points
ever
since
her
outing
with
lord
algy
she
had
been
aware
that
mere
is
not
enough
there
were
many
things
of
interest
in
life
that
she
would
never
have
heard
of
or
realised
the
existence
of
but
for
that
first
opening
to
her
imagination
strobridge
would
be
an
invaluable
teacher
but
she
must
get
up
a
few
technical
points
first
she
would
at
once
ask
her
mistress
if
she
might
take
some
books
from
the
library
up
to
her
for
the
evening
she
would
immediately
look
up
the
bald
facts
in
the
encyclopedia
to
begin
with
and
then
study
individual
volumes
then
there
were
the
painters
and
the
sculptors
to
learn
about
more
fully
although
she
had
often
gone
to
the
galleries
and
museums
in
london
but
not
with
what
she
now
knew
after
her
inspection
of
this
home
where
for
hundreds
of
years
the
owners
had
been
cultivated
collectors
was
a
critical
eye
she
felt
as
if
the
key
to
understanding
had
only
just
been
given
to
her
even
the
housekeeper
not
pepperdon
of
berkeley
square
but
this
elderly
portly
illingworth
knew
more
about
the
beauties
that
she
was
showing
off
than
she
did
this
state
of
ignorance
must
not
continue
for
even
a
week
permission
was
accorded
about
the
books
when
lady
garribardine
looked
into
the
secretary
room
before
her
tea
and
until
three
in
the
morning
this
indefatigable
young
woman
kept
her
lights
on
cramming
facts
into
her
head
and
then
when
her
work
was
over
before
lunch
next
day
she
walked
again
through
the
picture
gallery
and
the
big
to
see
if
she
had
mastered
anything
the
picture
gallery
was
filled
with
early
and
late
italian
works
and
some
fine
specimens
of
spanish
renaissance
as
well
as
english
portraits
she
found
that
with
even
this
much
knowledge
gained
she
had
already
grown
more
appreciative
but
she
realised
that
it
was
a
question
of
training
her
eye
as
well
as
her
brain
the
guests
were
all
to
arrive
on
christmas
eve
and
a
message
came
for
katherine
that
she
was
to
come
down
and
pour
out
the
tea
for
them
because
her
ladyship
hand
was
very
rheumatic
she
had
been
extremely
occupied
with
the
dispatching
of
parcels
of
presents
and
various
matters
all
the
afternoon
this
would
be
an
occasion
to
wear
the
grey
blouse
again
and
she
had
discovered
that
the
becoming
waves
upon
her
brow
could
be
achieved
also
by
water
and
combing
so
she
would
not
be
at
the
mercy
of
a
hairdresser
in
the
future
for
her
improved
looks
she
was
seated
behind
the
in
the
library
when
the
first
batch
of
the
visitors
arrived
by
train
strobridge
and
lady
beatrice
were
motoring
the
three
grandchildren
and
their
attendants
had
come
early
in
the
afternoon
the
party
consisted
of
the
two
old
maiden
cousins
the
misses
by
name
and
a
young
niece
of
theirs
and
two
or
three
stray
men
and
delemar
katherine
attended
to
their
wants
and
watched
the
whole
scene
no
one
had
greeted
her
but
whoever
chanced
to
be
near
her
exchanged
a
friendly
word
delemar
was
even
gracious
it
was
her
way
always
to
be
polite
to
everyone
how
easy
they
all
were
no
stiffness
no
and
one
of
the
men
was
quite
witty
and
the
young
miss
a
most
lively
modern
girl
katherine
enjoyed
herself
although
she
never
spoke
unless
spoken
to
and
then
returned
monosyllabic
answers
when
they
had
all
been
chaffing
and
eating
quantities
of
muffins
and
buns
and
blackberry
jam
and
cream
for
half
an
hour
gerard
strobridge
and
his
wife
came
in
we
have
had
the
most
deplorable
journey
aunt
sarah
lady
beatrice
announced
plaintively
a
judgment
upon
one
for
travelling
with
husband
gerard
would
drive
and
of
course
collided
with
a
milestone
and
injured
one
of
the
wheels
so
that
the
tire
which
broke
took
hours
to
put
on
again
and
i
was
frozen
with
cold
everyone
sympathised
with
her
while
strobridge
only
smiled
complacently
and
asked
katherine
for
some
tea
as
you
can
guess
i
shall
require
it
very
hot
and
very
strong
to
keep
my
courage
up
after
these
reproaches
and
he
smiled
as
though
to
say
i
am
sure
you
understand
katherine
attended
to
him
gravely
she
was
purposely
the
stiff
secretary
aloof
and
uninterested
in
what
was
going
on
strobridge
rather
wondered
at
it
and
it
piqued
him
a
little
but
the
lady
who
had
been
asked
for
his
special
delectation
had
no
intention
of
allowing
him
any
leisure
to
converse
with
anyone
else
she
gave
him
one
of
her
ravishing
smiles
moved
her
dress
a
little
to
make
room
for
him
on
her
sofa
and
then
whispered
to
him
softly
for
a
long
time
amidst
the
general
merry
din
nothing
escaped
the
eyes
and
intelligence
of
miss
bush
she
was
observing
behaviour
character
and
capability
in
each
one
of
the
guests
and
was
making
up
her
mind
what
she
would
do
next
for
the
furtherance
of
her
plan
that
gerard
strobridge
should
be
a
friend
for
one
moment
he
looked
up
and
met
her
eyes
and
she
allowed
hers
to
show
that
sphinxlike
smile
before
she
lowered
the
lids
gerard
strobridge
experienced
an
emotion
l√§o
was
perhaps
making
him
look
a
little
ridiculous
she
was
overdoing
her
pleasure
at
seeing
him
however
he
was
too
old
a
hand
at
dalliance
with
women
to
allow
himself
to
stay
beside
her
for
a
moment
after
he
felt
this
so
he
made
some
forcible
excuse
about
the
post
going
and
got
up
and
left
the
room
he
was
completely
at
home
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
at
blissington
court
katherine
smiled
again
to
herself
after
dinner
there
was
to
be
a
cinematograph
show
for
lady
garribardine
grandchildren
a
schoolboy
and
girls
of
ten
and
seven
and
they
were
dining
punctually
at
eight
katherine
was
to
bring
them
into
the
hall
when
the
entertainment
began
having
had
them
with
her
for
dinner
in
the
old
schoolroom
she
was
not
particularly
fond
of
children
but
she
did
her
best
to
make
them
enjoy
their
meal
they
were
stupid
unattractive
creatures
with
none
of
their
grandmother
wit
they
were
to
go
on
to
their
paternal
relations
for
the
new
year
and
then
with
their
governess
and
tutor
were
to
sail
to
join
their
parents
in
the
antipodes
the
dressy
blouse
had
to
do
duty
as
evening
attire
on
this
night
the
creation
of
gladys
arranging
must
be
kept
for
the
grand
occasion
of
the
christmas
dinner
in
the
but
katherine
had
altered
it
a
little
the
wretched
thing
and
cut
down
the
neck
to
make
it
more
becoming
it
looked
quite
suitable
to
her
station
in
any
case
she
thought
as
she
caught
sight
of
herself
in
the
long
glass
in
her
room
she
was
beginning
to
take
an
interest
in
dress
which
surprised
herself
she
took
a
chair
in
the
background
close
to
the
staircase
from
which
the
servants
were
to
be
allowed
to
witness
the
show
her
whole
demeanour
was
quiet
and
unremarkable
and
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
her
at
all
until
the
lights
were
turned
up
in
the
interval
between
one
set
of
pictures
and
another
when
lady
garribardine
called
out
to
her
can
you
see
from
where
you
are
miss
bush
the
next
thing
ought
to
be
very
funny
katherine
had
the
kind
of
voice
which
people
listen
to
and
one
or
two
of
the
men
glanced
round
at
her
when
she
answered
with
thanks
that
she
had
a
capital
view
and
old
colonel
hawthorne
said
to
a
young
guardsman
friend
of
miss
betty
that
by
jove
her
ladyship
secretary
or
the
children
governess
or
whoever
she
was
had
a
pair
of
eyes
worth
looking
at
gerard
strobridge
had
found
l√§o
charming
again
he
had
dined
well
and
partaken
of
his
aunt
promised
very
best
champagne
and
he
had
indulged
in
some
obviously
subtle
insinuations
as
to
his
further
intentions
in
regard
to
their
enjoyable
friendship
whispered
in
her
ear
while
the
lights
were
low
oh
gerard
i
wo
allow
you
to
wait
not
yet
delemar
had
gasped
prettily
expecting
him
to
press
the
matter
further
but
unfortunately
it
was
just
then
that
the
lights
had
blazed
up
and
gerard
had
turned
round
and
caught
sight
of
the
provoking
face
of
katherine
bush
as
his
aunt
spoke
how
attractive
that
confounded
girl
looks
he
thought
what
a
nuisance
she
is
not
married
and
a
guest
instead
of
the
typist
it
is
undignified
and
difficult
but
the
brief
glance
had
disturbed
him
and
rearoused
his
interest
he
found
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
up
to
the
desired
level
of
enthusiasm
again
with
l√§o
and
contented
himself
by
talking
enigmatically
about
the
parrot
rooms
that
she
was
in
their
situation
and
their
comfort
while
he
looked
unutterable
things
with
his
deep
grey
eyes
then
presently
when
they
all
moved
and
the
show
was
over
he
allowed
himself
to
be
supplanted
in
her
favours
by
a
promising
youth
of
three
and
twenty
a
distant
cousin
of
the
house
who
would
not
have
been
permitted
the
ghost
of
a
chance
at
another
time
but
gerard
emotions
did
not
show
on
the
surface
and
katherine
bush
slipped
up
to
bed
presently
in
rather
a
depressed
frame
of
mind
she
realised
fully
that
the
goal
was
yet
a
long
long
way
from
attainment
and
that
it
would
require
all
her
intelligence
to
walk
warily
through
this
coming
week
no
one
had
been
in
the
least
slighting
or
unkind
to
her
but
naturally
no
one
had
troubled
to
converse
with
her
she
was
just
the
secretary
and
was
treated
exactly
as
she
would
treat
her
own
when
she
had
one
she
felt
it
would
not
be
safe
to
attract
any
of
the
party
her
good
will
and
contentment
with
her
mattered
far
more
than
the
gratification
of
her
vanity
strobridge
however
was
one
of
the
chief
pieces
in
her
game
and
him
she
would
see
often
as
long
as
she
remained
in
lady
service
so
there
was
no
hurry
she
could
afford
to
wait
but
all
the
same
she
settled
down
to
read
the
seven
lamps
of
architecture
without
the
buoyant
feeling
of
which
usually
gave
her
such
a
proud
carriage
of
head
chapter
xiv
a
message
came
up
to
katherine
next
morning
the
morning
of
christmas
day
from
lady
garribardine
to
say
that
she
could
walk
across
the
park
to
church
with
the
two
elder
children
and
that
she
was
to
take
them
into
the
front
pew
that
faced
the
large
carved
family
one
behind
the
choir
at
right
angles
and
from
this
outlook
miss
bush
later
on
observed
the
house
party
enter
by
a
door
in
the
chancel
they
filled
the
whole
long
seat
and
overflowed
into
the
pew
where
she
and
the
children
sat
and
it
happened
that
gerard
strobridge
was
next
her
and
knelt
to
say
his
prayers
propinquity
is
a
very
curious
thing
and
when
all
possibility
of
conversation
is
nil
propinquity
has
sometimes
been
known
to
exert
a
very
powerful
influence
gerard
strobridge
was
conscious
with
every
throb
of
his
pulse
of
the
nearness
of
katherine
bush
there
was
a
magnetic
disturbing
emanation
he
felt
coming
from
her
which
excited
him
unaccountably
he
kept
glancing
at
her
regular
profile
from
time
to
time
her
very
pale
skin
and
large
red
mouth
attracted
him
immensely
she
never
once
looked
at
him
and
maintained
an
air
of
absolute
unconsciousness
what
is
she
thinking
about
i
wonder
he
mused
i
have
never
seen
a
face
more
sphinxlike
she
could
be
good
or
devilishly
bad
she
could
love
passionately
and
hate
coldly
she
could
be
cruel
as
the
grave
and
hard
as
adamant
she
is
a
woman
that
a
man
were
wiser
not
to
know
too
well
for
his
own
safety
but
reflections
of
this
sort
never
yet
made
son
of
adam
avoid
the
object
of
them
so
when
they
came
out
and
katherine
was
waiting
for
instructions
from
her
employer
as
to
the
disposal
of
the
children
strobridge
came
up
to
her
a
happy
christmas
miss
bush
he
said
are
you
going
to
walk
back
through
the
park
here
teddy
i
will
come
with
you
we
are
going
in
the
motor
with
grandmamma
both
children
cried
at
once
as
katherine
returned
his
greeting
and
they
ran
off
to
lady
garribardine
so
katherine
started
to
walk
on
alone
while
the
rest
of
the
party
lingered
about
the
porch
and
made
up
their
minds
as
to
whether
or
no
they
would
drive
she
had
gone
some
way
and
was
on
a
path
by
a
copse
in
the
park
when
strobridge
caught
her
up
why
did
you
race
ahead
miss
bush
he
asked
did
you
not
want
any
companion
in
your
solitude
i
never
thought
about
it
she
returned
quite
simply
i
did
i
wanted
to
walk
with
you
i
have
been
watching
you
all
the
time
in
church
i
believe
that
you
were
in
dreamland
again
now
will
be
the
very
moment
to
finish
our
discussion
upon
it
i
do
think
we
had
begun
it
well
we
will
how
are
we
to
start
you
are
going
to
tell
me
where
yours
is
in
the
heart
or
in
the
head
such
a
conversation
would
be
altogether
unprofitable
there
was
mischief
lurking
in
the
corner
of
her
eye
and
trembling
in
the
curves
of
her
full
mouth
i
must
judge
of
that
how
so
do
i
not
count
enormously
that
is
why
i
want
to
hear
of
your
dreamland
it
is
a
place
where
only
i
can
go
how
unsociable
but
you
look
disobliging
i
am
very
well
i
give
up
the
task
of
trying
to
make
you
tell
me
about
it
by
the
way
i
have
not
had
the
chance
to
thank
you
for
so
kindly
finishing
those
papers
for
that
confounded
charity
my
aunt
said
they
were
in
perfect
order
i
am
glad
of
that
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
away
in
front
of
them
down
into
a
dell
and
so
up
again
to
the
house
is
this
a
beautiful
view
i
always
think
of
stately
homes
of
england
when
i
walk
back
from
church
katherine
eyes
followed
his
to
the
gabled
irregular
red
brick
house
with
its
wreath
of
blue
smoke
going
straight
up
into
the
winter
sky
i
have
never
seen
one
before
she
told
him
you
can
imagine
how
wonderful
this
appears
to
me
after
the
place
where
i
have
lived
i
had
only
seen
hampton
court
but
somehow
all
the
people
there
and
its
being
a
museum
did
not
make
it
have
the
impression
of
a
house
that
is
inhabited
this
pleases
you
does
it
naturally
i
love
everything
about
it
the
space
and
people
not
being
allowed
in
it
is
her
ladyship
own
she
can
shut
the
gates
if
she
wants
to
and
have
it
all
to
herself
that
must
be
good
what
a
strange
girl
you
would
not
like
to
share
anything
then
i
have
already
remarked
this
deplorably
selfish
instinct
in
you
in
reference
to
your
dreamland
and
you
would
keep
poor
devils
out
of
your
park
too
if
you
could
generally
yes
well
i
want
to
be
the
exception
to
this
exclusiveness
if
i
come
up
one
afternoon
to
the
old
schoolroom
for
instance
and
ask
you
to
talk
to
me
will
you
turn
me
out
it
depends
what
you
want
me
to
talk
to
you
about
if
it
is
upon
a
subject
only
to
please
you
yes
if
to
please
me
then
i
may
let
you
stay
for
a
little
what
subjects
would
please
you
i
would
like
to
hear
all
about
the
pictures
in
the
house
for
instance
you
see
before
i
came
to
lady
garribardine
i
had
never
conversed
with
anyone
educated
in
art
so
i
have
only
a
very
little
book
knowledge
to
go
upon
we
will
talk
about
art
then
the
house
is
full
of
interesting
things
part
of
it
is
so
old
for
the
rest
of
the
way
he
did
his
best
to
entertain
his
insignificant
secretary
and
they
both
knew
that
the
walk
had
been
very
charming
when
they
got
into
the
shrubbery
katherine
took
the
path
which
led
to
the
small
courtyard
on
which
the
schoolroom
staircase
opened
of
course
i
had
forgotten
you
have
a
front
door
all
to
yourself
yes
our
roads
divide
here
good
morning
mr
strobridge
are
you
going
to
shake
hands
with
me
no
it
is
quite
unnecessary
then
i
shall
dance
with
you
i
have
not
danced
for
ten
years
then
probably
you
will
not
do
it
well
recollect
i
come
from
green
where
we
learn
the
very
newest
steps
i
never
have
put
up
with
a
bad
partner
i
ca
trot
if
that
is
what
you
mean
then
i
am
afraid
you
are
too
old
and
too
for
my
taste
and
smiling
demurely
she
walked
off
to
the
quaint
gate
which
opened
into
the
rose
garden
gerard
strobridge
laughed
as
he
went
on
his
way
why
was
he
attracted
to
this
girl
he
was
a
person
of
the
highest
fastidiousness
and
had
never
had
a
with
any
woman
beneath
him
in
class
in
his
life
even
in
his
oxford
days
it
was
against
his
idea
of
the
fitness
of
things
to
flirt
with
his
aunt
secretary
but
the
creature
was
so
sensible
and
so
intelligent
it
made
matters
appear
in
a
different
light
there
surely
could
not
be
much
harm
in
discussing
pictures
and
sculpture
with
her
or
a
poet
or
two
but
at
this
stage
he
did
put
some
restraint
upon
himself
and
made
no
further
attempts
to
see
her
until
she
came
down
to
pour
out
the
tea
again
he
bravely
made
love
to
l√§o
and
exercised
as
much
skill
to
keep
matters
from
approaching
a
climax
as
he
was
wont
to
use
in
bringing
on
that
happy
occurrence
it
caused
him
a
cynical
amusement
katherine
had
on
the
dress
which
rather
resembled
his
wife
and
looked
almost
as
distinguished
and
a
good
deal
more
healthy
and
attractive
her
demeanour
was
so
admirable
too
she
had
none
of
either
that
overhumble
obsequiousness
or
touchy
assertion
which
so
often
distinguished
these
he
thought
she
might
have
been
a
lady
clara
vere
de
vere
in
her
quiet
dignity
and
utter
freedom
from
all
it
was
evident
that
she
was
not
thinking
of
herself
at
all
or
wondering
whether
or
no
she
was
being
noticed
or
slighted
or
properly
or
improperly
treated
she
was
just
gravely
pouring
out
the
tea
and
attending
to
people
wants
as
quietly
sure
of
herself
as
his
aunt
would
have
been
indeed
it
almost
seemed
to
gerard
watching
her
that
she
stood
out
if
he
could
have
selected
one
from
the
whole
party
as
the
most
perfect
specimen
of
womanhood
was
it
her
supreme
will
her
force
of
character
which
had
overcome
all
class
traditions
he
remembered
what
she
had
said
about
no
ordinary
radical
ever
being
able
to
be
a
foreign
minister
how
she
must
have
thought
out
matters
her
brain
was
that
of
a
woman
in
a
thousand
the
christmas
tea
grew
very
merry
and
old
colonel
hawthorne
friend
of
the
family
for
countless
years
found
it
his
pleasant
duty
to
be
genial
with
the
secretary
gerard
continued
to
watch
she
answered
the
pleasantries
with
so
much
wit
and
never
the
least
presumption
after
a
while
he
drifted
up
to
his
aunt
own
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
dressing
time
l√§o
had
been
cajoled
into
thinking
all
was
well
between
them
and
had
gone
off
to
make
herself
especially
beautiful
for
dinner
she
had
been
through
one
or
two
disquieting
moments
gerard
had
appeared
all
that
an
eager
lover
should
be
and
she
felt
she
must
have
been
stupid
in
some
way
to
have
given
him
the
impression
that
she
was
serious
in
her
protestation
of
not
yet
she
had
no
rival
that
was
plain
to
be
seen
he
never
spoke
to
betty
who
was
the
only
other
young
woman
of
the
party
perhaps
it
was
because
of
beatrice
gerard
was
such
a
perfect
gentleman
perhaps
in
some
corner
of
a
foolishly
overpunctilious
heart
he
was
deterred
by
beatrice
but
fortunately
beatrice
was
leaving
the
day
after
boxing
day
in
any
case
her
usual
method
of
rigid
circumspection
until
the
very
last
moment
had
not
been
quite
successful
with
this
lover
he
had
been
deceived
by
it
and
slightly
rebuffed
it
was
merciful
as
far
as
her
own
emotions
were
concerned
but
she
knew
men
well
enough
to
know
that
unless
she
herself
had
damped
his
ardour
this
state
of
things
was
not
altogether
natural
and
therefore
it
might
imply
some
lack
in
her
own
charm
which
was
not
an
agreeable
thought
however
she
need
not
feel
really
disquieted
while
his
attentions
were
still
so
seraphim
i
walked
back
from
church
with
miss
bush
gerard
said
stretching
himself
out
in
a
huge
chair
by
his
aunt
fire
while
he
lighted
a
cigarette
you
are
quite
right
she
is
a
most
intelligent
young
woman
how
do
you
account
for
that
something
about
her
which
is
not
at
all
of
her
class
i
do
know
it
has
puzzled
me
i
was
watching
her
pouring
out
the
tea
she
is
the
first
secretary
i
have
ever
had
not
excepting
poor
arnott
who
on
such
occasions
did
not
feel
that
one
or
other
of
the
guests
was
trying
to
snub
her
katherine
bush
is
never
on
the
defensive
it
is
quite
unique
in
a
person
of
her
station
i
watched
her
too
and
was
struck
with
the
same
thing
and
she
talked
so
well
she
wanted
to
hear
about
the
pictures
she
is
absolutely
frank
and
tells
one
in
the
na√Øvest
manner
about
what
things
she
is
ignorant
of
but
one
finds
that
she
must
have
read
considerably
she
is
full
of
theories
about
tradition
and
evolution
i
let
her
tell
me
them
motoring
down
she
seems
to
have
dissected
herself
and
her
family
in
an
endeavour
to
eradicate
what
she
disapproves
of
in
the
way
of
instincts
it
is
astonishing
is
it
seraphim
very
she
made
one
or
two
rather
dreadful
gaffes
when
she
first
came
especially
during
the
tableaux
week
it
was
quite
interesting
to
see
her
face
when
she
realised
this
she
did
not
once
try
to
explain
them
away
she
drew
in
her
lips
and
i
could
see
she
was
registering
a
vow
never
to
make
the
same
mistake
again
that
kind
of
nature
always
wins
any
game
it
is
playing
i
wonder
what
hers
is
do
you
the
immediate
one
obviously
is
to
turn
herself
into
a
lady
she
means
to
do
in
a
few
years
consciously
what
nature
takes
many
generations
to
accomplish
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
her
progress
is
quite
remarkable
even
in
these
six
weeks
what
shall
you
do
with
her
seraphim
keep
her
as
long
as
she
will
stay
with
me
and
perhaps
take
her
education
in
hand
myself
when
you
all
leave
and
then
lady
garribardine
laughed
softly
l√§o
is
a
huge
joke
dear
boy
i
think
the
parrot
rooms
suit
her
do
you
are
you
pleased
with
my
arrangements
for
my
guests
there
was
something
exquisitely
whimsical
in
her
ladyship
old
black
eyes
his
met
them
delightedly
aunt
and
nephew
understood
each
other
so
well
these
two
perfect
citizens
of
the
world
l√§o
is
charming
and
i
am
sure
she
is
deriving
all
sorts
of
inspirations
from
the
blue
macaw
amourettes
with
the
cockatoo
which
she
looks
at
from
her
downy
couch
seraphim
i
am
going
to
persuade
beatrice
to
stay
on
beatrice
is
an
excellent
creature
in
spite
of
her
contempt
for
my
powers
as
a
chauffeur
she
is
quite
amused
with
victor
thistlethwaite
i
paved
the
way
by
suggesting
to
her
this
morning
that
she
should
take
the
early
train
on
thursday
and
she
said
at
once
that
she
rather
thought
she
was
not
leaving
until
saturday
with
the
rest
lady
garribardine
chuckled
delightedly
the
noise
was
as
of
cream
bubbling
if
cream
can
bubble
was
all
she
said
and
then
went
on
to
speak
of
other
things
betty
is
going
to
catch
young
allonby
i
believe
they
will
settle
it
for
one
of
my
blood
she
has
a
number
of
overmodern
faults
and
gwendoline
and
arabella
will
be
glad
to
get
her
off
their
hands
she
is
a
promising
young
person
even
blood
ca
stand
against
the
total
want
of
discipline
which
prevails
among
the
present
generation
when
these
impossible
children
have
grown
up
there
wo
be
any
ladies
left
i
do
think
they
will
have
many
children
we
are
breeding
a
neuter
race
seraphim
all
the
games
are
making
their
bones
too
rigid
and
all
the
want
of
discipline
is
weakening
their
nerves
very
few
of
the
future
ones
will
be
able
to
stand
the
agonies
of
you
are
not
in
a
position
to
criticise
with
no
offspring
of
your
own
i
am
not
an
eldest
son
there
is
no
obligation
entailed
upon
me
dick
has
three
boys
fortunately
and
alec
two
i
consider
that
the
poorest
excuse
strobridge
sighed
perhaps
it
is
the
whole
thing
is
rather
played
out
with
us
all
it
seraphim
when
i
talked
with
that
balanced
healthy
young
woman
i
felt
we
want
an
admixture
of
new
blood
in
a
number
of
our
families
if
only
to
bring
back
our
enthusiasm
dick
children
are
fine
enough
fellows
physically
but
there
is
not
half
a
peck
o
wits
among
them
and
as
you
know
alec
little
yankee
chaps
are
what
their
mother
calls
to
a
degree
but
masses
of
overstrung
nerves
as
well
lady
garribardine
leaned
forward
from
among
her
sofa
cushions
and
looked
at
her
nephew
with
a
quizzical
eye
if
you
were
free
and
my
heir
i
marry
you
off
to
katherine
bush
just
for
the
pleasure
of
the
experiment
then
the
little
s√®vres
clock
chimed
why
it
is
striking
the
quarter
rush
off
at
once
dear
boy
and
do
forget
to
put
on
your
hunt
coat
the
scarlet
pleases
the
children
in
another
part
of
the
house
her
ladyship
secretary
quite
unaware
that
she
was
under
discussion
was
joyously
dressing
in
her
pretty
room
with
a
delicious
sense
of
excitement
martha
was
coming
in
to
help
her
presently
for
this
wonderful
first
occasion
in
her
life
when
she
should
put
on
a
real
evening
dress
showing
pearl
white
neck
and
arms
gladys
had
given
her
every
instruction
as
to
its
fastenings
and
had
supervised
the
making
of
it
with
a
zeal
which
she
would
only
have
bestowed
upon
an
order
from
the
richest
customer
the
frock
fitted
to
perfection
and
was
astonishingly
becoming
in
its
black
simplicity
martha
had
brought
her
in
some
beautiful
lilies
of
the
valley
when
she
came
with
her
hot
water
accompanied
by
the
information
that
strobridge
valet
had
handed
them
to
her
for
miss
bush
from
his
master
gerard
had
been
robbing
the
hothouses
evidently
the
head
gardener
was
a
particular
friend
of
his
they
were
just
the
touch
wanted
to
complete
the
picture
their
snowy
whiteness
and
brilliant
forced
green
gave
the
note
of
freshness
which
went
so
well
with
katherine
skin
of
an
astonishing
purity
by
as
clear
as
ivory
and
as
pale
in
tone
she
gazed
into
her
and
felt
satisfied
with
what
she
saw
and
presently
she
held
her
shoulders
back
and
her
head
up
and
walked
down
the
corridor
with
the
grace
of
a
com√©die
fran√ßaise
queen
so
greatly
does
the
consciousness
of
fine
raiment
affect
the
morale
of
young
women
lady
beatrice
came
out
of
her
room
in
the
great
gallery
and
they
went
down
together
you
do
look
so
pretty
miss
bush
she
said
what
a
duck
of
a
frock
it
looks
like
an
ermantine
yes
my
sister
is
a
saleswoman
there
and
she
had
it
made
for
me
katherine
told
i
am
glad
you
think
it
looks
well
i
have
never
had
on
a
real
evening
dress
before
you
know
how
to
wear
it
so
that
is
all
right
ah
children
come
along
as
three
joyous
calls
came
from
over
the
banisters
and
katherine
slipped
on
alone
lady
garribardine
had
told
her
before
she
went
to
dress
to
go
to
bronson
to
see
that
a
special
order
about
the
presents
was
carried
out
all
the
party
were
assembled
in
the
great
when
this
duty
was
done
and
so
her
entrance
did
not
pass
unremarked
by
jove
was
the
significant
exclamation
of
old
colonel
hawthorne
and
i
am
to
have
the
pleasure
of
taking
you
in
to
dinner
said
the
charming
young
man
who
had
so
far
succeeded
in
diverting
lady
beatrice
gerard
strobridge
felt
a
strange
sensation
as
he
looked
at
katherine
presently
between
the
great
bowls
of
camellias
there
was
no
comparison
with
anyone
at
the
table
her
ladyship
secretary
had
blossomed
forth
into
the
beauty
of
the
night
how
clothes
can
alter
a
person
delemar
said
without
conscious
spite
dependents
even
pretty
ones
were
not
things
which
look
dear
sarah
typist
appears
quite
pretty
and
how
kind
she
is
to
her
servants
see
she
has
let
the
girl
have
those
beautiful
lilies
of
the
valley
which
hawke
told
me
when
you
were
making
him
give
me
the
orchids
it
just
breaks
his
heart
to
have
to
cut
chapter
xv
the
sudden
accession
to
beauty
in
lady
garribardine
secretary
had
a
double
nay
treble
result
it
caused
victor
thistlethwaite
plainly
to
show
that
he
perceived
it
at
dinner
and
thereby
considerably
to
annoy
both
the
lady
beatrice
and
gerard
strobridge
during
that
meal
lady
beatrice
considered
it
impertinence
on
the
part
of
miss
bush
and
strobridge
found
it
ridiculous
cheek
of
that
insufferable
puppy
thistlethwaite
katherine
for
her
part
enjoyed
herself
she
had
got
over
the
awe
of
servants
and
the
strangeness
of
companions
she
was
now
sure
of
the
methods
of
eating
too
and
so
had
leisure
to
enjoy
conversation
and
she
was
filled
with
that
delicious
sovereign
complacency
which
only
a
woman
discovering
that
she
is
undeniably
a
success
can
know
while
remaining
exceedingly
demure
she
managed
to
arrest
the
exclusive
attention
of
her
partner
for
the
feast
and
lady
garribardine
watched
the
whole
thing
with
a
whimsical
eye
gerard
strobridge
was
too
good
a
diplomat
to
allow
the
vaguest
trace
of
his
disturbed
equilibrium
to
show
in
his
face
and
talked
to
l√§o
with
renewed
passion
so
that
before
they
began
to
pull
crackers
she
was
feeling
perfectly
contented
in
the
certain
conviction
that
it
was
beatrice
presence
alone
which
kept
him
within
bounds
he
had
not
made
love
to
women
ever
since
he
left
eton
or
served
his
country
at
the
foreign
office
until
the
age
of
without
acquiring
a
certain
experience
in
feminine
psychology
and
a
knowledge
as
to
the
best
manipulation
of
diplomatic
situations
and
even
though
he
had
been
irritated
by
thistlethwaite
evident
admiration
he
saw
that
it
would
certainly
cause
beatrice
to
stay
until
the
saturday
and
so
in
it
there
lay
good
there
were
quantities
of
silver
charms
in
the
blazing
and
some
received
omens
of
wealth
and
some
of
princely
mates
or
lengthy
journeys
but
gerard
strobridge
could
only
secure
the
emblem
of
an
old
maid
a
thimble
was
his
portion
and
he
turned
the
unhappy
augury
to
much
good
account
in
a
suitable
reproach
to
l√§o
when
the
caps
from
the
crackers
were
put
on
an
early
english
gold
paper
crown
fell
to
katherine
share
and
became
her
mightily
why
miss
bush
looks
just
like
queen
victoria
when
she
came
to
the
throne
grandmamma
called
out
the
elder
girl
grandchild
we
have
her
picture
on
the
nursery
screen
and
i
wonder
what
her
end
will
be
gerard
strobridge
thought
she
looks
remarkably
well
in
a
crown
the
hall
had
been
cleared
for
dancing
and
when
the
excitement
in
opening
the
wonderful
little
presents
which
lay
hidden
in
a
rose
by
each
person
plate
was
over
the
company
poured
in
there
while
three
local
musicians
struck
up
a
merry
tune
it
was
a
and
miss
betty
must
try
it
with
some
new
variations
which
were
just
coming
in
from
america
at
that
date
it
was
before
tango
days
katherine
was
an
adept
in
them
for
was
not
bindon
green
always
in
the
forefront
of
modernity
and
any
kind
of
dancing
she
really
loved
it
was
the
one
pastime
of
her
sisters
which
she
had
shared
with
delight
and
often
practised
with
ethel
in
their
tiny
before
going
to
bed
thistlethwaite
asked
her
for
a
turn
with
him
and
they
started
off
it
is
much
better
than
a
stupid
old
valse
is
it
he
said
to
her
while
they
careered
smoothly
ahead
and
by
jove
how
well
you
dance
the
blood
was
rushing
in
katherine
veins
it
was
so
good
to
be
young
and
admired
and
forgetful
of
relative
positions
for
once
in
a
way
she
knew
very
well
that
she
was
a
far
finer
performer
than
the
other
young
girl
and
all
that
was
sensuous
in
her
nature
came
uppermost
and
quivered
through
the
rhythmic
movements
of
her
supple
body
gerard
strobridge
watched
her
silently
he
was
conscious
of
profound
and
increasing
emotion
it
was
as
if
some
primitive
strong
vital
thing
was
there
before
him
dwarfing
the
puny
at
passion
which
were
so
well
assumed
by
l√§o
delemar
she
was
standing
beside
him
looking
as
beautiful
and
as
artificial
as
the
orchids
in
her
dress
how
that
girl
could
love
he
breathed
to
himself
as
he
watched
the
dancers
and
l√§o
seemed
as
utterly
meaningless
as
a
wax
doll
once
was
enough
of
this
sort
of
thing
katherine
bush
thought
she
was
keenly
alive
to
atmospheres
and
she
felt
that
for
a
secretary
to
do
more
than
show
that
she
was
proficient
in
these
steps
would
be
a
breach
of
taste
so
no
persuasions
of
her
partner
would
move
her
after
the
first
few
rounds
and
she
left
him
and
went
off
with
the
youngest
grandchild
in
a
polka
step
thus
the
lady
beatrice
recovered
her
whilom
admirer
and
when
another
tune
had
begun
and
l√§o
had
been
safely
lured
into
the
arms
of
the
distant
cousin
gerard
strobridge
came
over
casually
to
where
katherine
stood
am
i
to
be
allowed
a
turn
of
this
valse
miss
bush
he
asked
but
katherine
was
not
to
be
beguiled
so
easily
she
must
parley
first
i
do
not
know
if
her
ladyship
expects
me
to
dance
any
more
she
answered
if
you
think
she
will
not
mind
my
accepting
this
honour
i
shall
be
very
pleased
foolish
thing
is
it
not
christmas
night
and
are
you
not
the
belle
of
the
ball
and
he
held
out
his
arm
and
they
whirled
off
it
gave
him
immense
pleasure
to
hold
her
in
his
embrace
but
something
in
the
scent
of
the
violets
in
his
scarlet
hunt
coat
brought
back
to
katherine
with
a
sickening
thrill
of
anguish
and
longing
the
remembrance
of
lord
algy
and
the
saturday
night
in
paris
when
they
had
danced
in
masks
and
dominoes
at
a
bal
tabarin
oh
the
pain
of
it
suddenly
the
whole
present
melted
away
from
her
the
dreams
of
the
future
the
pride
in
her
conquest
of
the
past
the
passionate
woman
in
her
cried
aloud
in
wild
longing
for
him
algy
her
darling
her
mate
how
plain
were
these
other
young
men
how
tired
and
old
gerard
strobridge
looked
at
that
moment
she
would
have
thrown
her
whole
ambitions
away
into
nothingness
to
be
clasped
once
more
to
algy
heart
her
cheeks
became
ashen
white
and
her
strange
eyes
grew
shadowed
and
fierce
and
gerard
strobridge
was
brought
up
sharply
out
of
his
intoxication
of
emotion
by
the
look
in
her
face
what
is
it
child
he
asked
anxiously
holding
her
close
let
me
go
let
me
go
she
cried
wildly
breaking
from
him
near
the
staircase
recess
i
i
can
not
bear
it
i
would
like
to
get
out
of
all
this
he
was
intensely
astonished
but
he
saw
that
she
was
trembling
and
well
as
he
knew
women
he
could
not
fathom
the
reason
of
this
strange
outburst
katherine
recovered
her
composure
almost
immediately
and
gave
a
short
mirthless
laugh
i
am
awfully
stupid
she
faltered
i
can
not
think
what
came
over
me
i
believe
it
must
be
because
i
am
unaccustomed
to
parties
and
it
is
getting
late
it
is
not
yet
eleven
but
come
and
have
something
to
drink
i
see
a
tray
down
there
in
the
long
hall
and
she
let
him
lead
her
to
it
and
pour
out
some
champagne
and
seltzer
for
her
and
then
they
sat
down
he
saw
very
well
that
something
had
deeply
moved
her
and
his
perfect
tact
would
not
permit
him
to
refer
to
the
occurrence
but
caused
him
rather
to
talk
soothingly
of
ordinary
things
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
saw
that
the
normal
whiteness
had
come
back
to
her
face
but
nothing
would
induce
her
to
dance
any
more
and
although
she
continued
doing
whatever
was
expected
of
her
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
and
snatched
flaming
raisins
in
the
snapdragon
with
dashing
indifference
to
pain
he
knew
that
she
was
doing
it
all
as
an
automaton
and
that
the
living
vital
magnetic
katherine
was
no
longer
there
and
that
this
pale
quiet
girl
whose
hand
he
held
presently
in
the
deserted
corridor
was
only
too
glad
to
say
dear
child
he
whispered
as
he
kissed
it
with
homage
i
do
know
what
it
was
that
caused
it
but
you
have
evidently
seen
a
ghost
and
now
go
to
bed
and
forget
everything
but
that
we
have
all
had
an
awfully
happy
christmas
and
i
want
to
tell
you
how
pleased
i
am
that
you
have
worn
my
flowers
your
flowers
oh
yes
i
ought
to
have
thanked
you
for
them
before
they
were
lovely
but
now
they
are
dead
and
she
unpinned
them
carelessly
almost
as
if
she
did
not
like
them
any
longer
to
touch
her
and
threw
them
in
the
big
open
grate
and
thank
you
for
your
kindness
and
she
was
off
down
the
passage
and
up
the
side
stairs
and
when
gerard
strobridge
joined
the
rest
of
the
party
in
the
he
had
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
as
though
he
had
been
having
a
smoke
and
it
required
all
his
polished
skill
to
bring
himself
back
to
talking
gaily
and
to
looking
what
he
did
not
feel
into
delemar
sparkling
eyes
before
they
all
parted
for
the
night
meanwhile
katherine
bush
had
reached
her
room
and
had
flung
herself
into
the
armchair
this
would
not
do
she
must
steel
herself
against
giving
way
to
weakness
like
this
why
had
the
scent
of
the
violets
in
another
man
coat
had
power
to
affect
her
so
that
every
part
of
her
being
cried
out
for
algy
as
though
the
suppressed
emotions
of
her
heart
would
no
longer
obey
her
will
and
must
proclaim
themselves
her
master
it
was
shameful
feebleness
and
she
indignantly
resented
the
dominion
that
love
still
held
over
her
she
sat
there
reasoning
with
herself
but
nature
reigned
stronger
than
any
other
thing
at
the
moment
and
the
memory
of
her
lover
obsessed
her
she
seemed
to
hear
his
voice
and
feel
his
kisses
until
the
agony
of
longing
for
reality
grew
unbearable
and
she
fell
forward
and
lay
there
on
the
rug
before
the
fire
beating
the
floor
with
her
hands
it
was
as
the
despair
of
some
fierce
savage
caged
animal
crying
out
for
its
mate
her
whole
face
altered
the
most
intense
passion
blazed
from
her
eyes
and
whitened
her
cheeks
could
gerard
strobridge
have
seen
her
he
would
indeed
have
been
moved
algy
algy
my
darling
my
love
come
back
to
me
i
want
you
my
dear
my
dear
she
sobbed
with
agony
and
then
worn
out
at
last
oh
god
she
wailed
can
whatever
comes
be
worth
it
after
all
but
by
the
morning
she
had
crushed
emotion
and
came
down
ready
to
assist
with
the
huge
christmas
tree
for
the
tenants
children
with
her
usually
composed
face
but
that
passion
denied
should
have
exacted
this
anguish
frightened
her
a
little
all
her
will
should
be
used
to
prevent
such
madness
ever
holding
sway
again
chapter
xvi
lady
beatrice
remained
until
the
saturday
greatly
to
her
satisfaction
and
relief
he
had
manoeuvred
this
arrangement
with
much
skill
and
l√§o
vanity
felt
satisfied
and
indeed
gratified
by
the
belief
that
the
presence
of
his
wife
was
causing
gerard
untold
suffering
and
disappointment
the
preliminaries
of
the
game
were
so
very
agreeable
and
when
they
could
be
prolonged
by
fate
so
that
there
was
no
fear
of
losing
the
other
participant
in
them
nothing
could
be
more
to
her
taste
passion
like
that
which
katherine
bush
knew
would
have
appeared
as
something
absolutely
shocking
and
horrible
to
her
indeed
she
would
have
agreed
with
mabel
cawber
in
considering
it
as
most
unladylike
the
circumstance
of
the
christmas
night
dance
had
left
a
feeling
of
mystery
with
gerard
strobridge
which
did
not
detract
from
his
interest
in
katherine
bush
that
some
strong
upheaval
had
taken
place
in
this
strange
young
woman
soul
he
did
not
doubt
but
what
in
heaven
name
had
caused
it
did
it
concern
him
or
was
he
only
the
medium
connecting
some
memory
he
wished
he
could
feel
sure
then
there
was
the
incident
of
his
flowers
why
had
she
worn
them
and
then
thrown
them
from
her
as
if
they
had
burnt
her
his
rather
tormenting
thoughts
kept
him
too
frequent
company
especially
as
the
provoking
girl
seemed
to
have
retired
from
sight
and
except
on
rare
occasions
before
everyone
he
never
had
the
chance
of
even
a
word
lady
garribardine
rheumatism
was
better
so
miss
bush
had
not
even
been
required
to
pour
out
the
tea
it
was
with
a
sigh
of
intense
relief
that
he
returned
into
the
hall
after
tucking
l√§o
and
his
wife
into
the
motor
en
route
for
london
town
on
saturday
morning
an
hour
or
two
before
lunch
the
hostess
was
not
down
to
speed
her
parting
guests
she
was
very
much
occupied
in
her
boudoir
and
they
had
gone
thither
to
bid
her
farewell
as
strobridge
mounted
the
stairs
he
met
katherine
coming
out
of
the
room
with
her
arms
full
of
papers
and
small
parcels
and
a
couple
of
big
books
which
she
had
some
ado
to
carry
let
me
help
you
he
said
eagerly
and
she
gave
him
the
heavy
volumes
without
a
word
a
sense
of
exasperation
arose
in
him
he
would
not
be
flouted
like
this
he
followed
her
to
the
old
schoolroom
merely
remarking
on
the
way
that
now
all
the
guests
except
colonel
hawthorne
had
departed
he
felt
there
was
breathing
space
katherine
seemed
quite
unconcerned
and
indifferent
as
to
whether
he
did
or
did
not
and
she
took
his
burden
from
him
and
thanked
him
absently
with
a
look
towards
the
door
evidently
expecting
him
to
go
back
again
whence
he
came
but
he
showed
no
signs
of
moving
am
i
to
be
offered
a
chair
on
this
my
first
call
upon
miss
bush
it
is
a
call
you
helped
me
to
carry
the
books
i
am
very
busy
i
do
care
i
am
here
now
and
i
am
going
to
stay
i
shall
tell
my
aunt
how
inhospitable
and
ungracious
you
are
sneak
and
she
began
sorting
the
little
parcels
into
a
row
her
sullen
eyes
smiling
i
always
hated
at
school
so
did
i
but
i
could
commit
any
crime
to
be
with
you
i
have
been
tantalized
all
the
week
miss
bush
not
even
seen
at
tea
and
only
glimpses
of
her
scurrying
along
passages
and
up
stairs
what
then
do
you
want
with
miss
bush
have
you
some
more
charity
business
to
do
no
the
charity
will
be
quite
on
the
side
of
the
fair
katherine
if
she
will
allow
a
weary
wayfarer
to
bask
in
the
sunshine
of
her
presence
for
a
little
while
strobridge
you
are
talking
nonsense
and
i
have
not
a
time
to
waste
on
you
i
love
to
talk
nonsense
it
annoys
you
and
i
want
to
see
your
eyes
flash
i
have
seen
them
laughing
and
full
of
pain
and
snakily
cold
now
i
want
them
to
flash
and
then
i
would
like
them
to
grow
they
would
be
divine
like
that
katherine
sat
down
and
took
up
a
pen
with
a
glance
of
withering
indifference
then
she
began
to
address
the
labels
of
the
packets
from
a
list
he
came
quite
close
to
her
he
was
feeling
a
number
of
things
what
a
temptress
you
are
are
you
teasing
me
like
this
katherine
now
opened
her
eyes
wide
and
stared
at
him
but
she
did
not
move
away
an
inch
the
whole
thing
is
only
in
your
imagination
she
said
calmly
you
are
a
proof
of
my
theory
that
personal
emotion
creates
appearance
and
hides
reality
you
understand
then
that
i
do
feel
emotion
why
of
course
a
man
of
your
brains
and
cultivation
could
not
behave
in
so
foolish
a
way
otherwise
he
drew
back
and
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
while
he
laughed
shortly
katherine
continued
to
work
i
am
merely
waiting
until
you
have
finished
directing
those
confounded
parcels
which
i
presume
are
for
this
post
and
then
i
am
going
to
coax
you
to
talk
to
me
may
i
smoke
yes
if
you
like
still
with
lowered
head
wo
you
have
a
cigarette
thanks
he
handed
her
one
from
his
case
she
pulled
a
box
of
matches
near
and
lit
it
casually
going
on
with
her
work
as
a
boy
might
have
done
there
was
no
knocking
off
of
ash
or
graceful
movement
of
the
hand
in
the
fashion
of
l√§o
who
loved
her
white
jewelled
fingers
to
be
seen
to
advantage
neither
of
them
spoke
he
might
not
have
been
in
the
room
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
he
on
the
contrary
was
profoundly
aware
of
her
presence
emotion
such
as
he
had
not
felt
for
years
was
surging
through
him
she
was
the
most
damnably
attractive
creature
he
thought
he
had
ever
met
she
awoke
primitive
passions
and
stirred
his
blood
there
was
that
intense
note
of
reality
and
strength
about
her
she
was
like
some
dangerous
lazy
lioness
she
made
him
feel
that
civilisation
was
slipping
from
him
and
that
he
could
willingly
seize
her
for
a
jungle
mate
she
however
continued
to
smoke
and
to
write
for
quite
ten
minutes
until
all
the
parcels
were
addressed
and
several
papers
examined
and
annotated
and
filed
then
she
looked
up
his
eyes
had
never
left
her
face
i
ca
think
how
you
can
stare
like
that
she
said
with
abominable
it
would
make
me
blink
i
can
enjoy
looking
at
the
sun
now
are
those
infernal
things
finished
i
have
been
waiting
with
the
patience
of
job
but
i
ca
think
what
for
to
talk
to
you
well
talk
then
i
must
do
some
typing
and
she
got
up
and
went
to
her
machine
which
was
on
another
table
by
the
window
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
she
was
driving
him
mad
it
gave
her
a
savage
pleasure
and
seemed
a
sort
of
balance
to
her
own
emotions
on
christmas
night
about
algy
he
came
and
leant
against
the
mantelpiece
and
looked
down
at
her
and
quoted
dryden
she
knows
her
man
and
when
you
rant
and
swear
can
draw
you
to
her
with
a
single
hair
and
stretching
out
his
hand
he
touched
for
an
instant
the
faint
broad
waves
on
her
forehead
and
now
he
saw
her
eyes
flash
brilliantly
enough
if
you
are
going
to
be
impertinent
strobridge
the
staircase
into
the
garden
is
quite
close
and
the
sooner
you
find
your
way
to
it
the
better
i
shall
be
pleased
i
would
not
be
impertinent
for
the
world
the
temptation
was
overwhelming
it
is
so
lovely
your
hair
his
voice
was
quite
sincere
and
it
was
not
in
her
plan
to
quarrel
with
him
very
well
i
want
to
hear
so
many
things
about
you
child
tell
me
what
made
you
come
to
my
aunt
i
somehow
can
not
ever
feel
that
you
should
be
in
any
dependent
position
i
came
to
educate
myself
i
do
not
mean
to
be
dependent
always
what
do
you
do
in
the
foreign
office
he
gave
her
a
brief
sketch
of
his
days
well
then
she
said
you
have
to
do
what
you
are
told
to
also
nothing
matters
as
long
as
the
spirit
is
not
dependent
you
will
be
a
chief
some
day
i
suppose
perhaps
and
are
you
learning
here
yes
and
you
could
teach
me
if
you
liked
i
should
quite
adore
it
what
wages
should
i
have
none
then
that
means
by
the
rules
of
all
games
that
i
should
be
working
for
love
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
put
in
another
piece
of
paper
in
the
typing
machine
she
had
no
intention
of
talking
about
love
you
are
the
queerest
creature
you
make
me
feel
i
do
not
know
what
well
if
you
wo
discuss
wages
tell
me
what
i
am
to
teach
you
literature
do
you
remember
a
day
when
i
came
in
and
had
coffee
in
the
it
was
before
you
knew
i
existed
you
and
her
ladyship
talked
of
the
things
then
which
i
would
like
you
to
talk
to
me
about
yes
was
it
not
strange
i
must
have
been
blind
all
those
weeks
the
sphinxlike
smile
hovered
round
katherine
mouth
it
was
enigmatic
and
horribly
tantalizing
gerard
strobridge
felt
a
rush
of
wild
emotion
again
the
temptation
to
seize
her
in
his
arms
and
passionately
kiss
those
mocking
lips
almost
overcame
him
it
is
quite
doubtful
what
might
have
eventuated
if
at
that
moment
he
had
not
caught
sight
of
old
colonel
hawthorne
in
the
rose
garden
he
had
come
out
through
the
same
little
door
which
katherine
used
the
passage
from
which
on
the
ground
floor
led
to
the
he
waved
his
hand
and
beckoned
to
gerard
it
broke
the
spell
and
drove
some
sense
into
the
latter
head
colonel
hawthorne
is
calling
you
had
not
you
better
go
and
get
some
air
miss
bush
suggested
graciously
it
would
be
most
beneficial
i
am
sure
to
you
on
this
fine
morning
i
daresay
you
are
right
well
i
will
go
only
some
day
perhaps
you
will
pay
me
some
wages
after
all
is
that
a
threat
not
in
the
least
he
went
towards
the
door
do
be
cross
and
when
you
have
time
will
you
come
and
see
the
pictures
in
the
gallery
yes
i
would
love
that
and
her
face
brightened
but
you
had
better
ask
lady
garribardine
if
i
may
all
right
leave
it
to
me
revoir
and
he
was
gone
as
he
went
down
the
stairs
he
thought
that
it
was
a
good
idea
of
his
aunt
to
have
had
the
removed
to
this
wing
of
the
house
it
had
only
been
done
that
autumn
so
that
the
shooters
could
go
straight
in
if
they
pleased
by
the
side
door
katherine
did
not
continue
her
typing
for
a
moment
after
she
was
left
alone
her
brows
were
contracted
she
was
thinking
deeply
strobridge
might
not
be
quite
so
easy
to
rule
as
charlie
prodgers
she
had
heard
that
thoroughbred
racers
required
the
lightest
hand
and
also
that
there
were
moments
when
nothing
would
control
them
neither
bridle
nor
whip
nor
spur
she
must
think
out
her
plan
of
action
coolly
it
was
necessary
for
what
she
required
of
him
that
his
desire
to
please
her
should
surmount
all
other
things
at
the
present
stage
it
would
be
difficult
to
get
him
to
talk
sense
but
she
would
do
her
best
to
make
him
do
so
this
point
settled
she
went
on
with
her
work
again
undisturbed
gerard
strobridge
found
old
tom
hawthorne
a
tiresome
companion
on
their
prowl
round
the
stables
and
soon
escaped
to
his
aunt
he
must
somehow
arrange
for
katherine
to
see
the
pictures
with
him
after
lunch
lady
garribardine
was
reading
the
when
he
came
in
and
looked
up
delightedly
she
enjoyed
converse
with
her
favourite
at
any
hour
they
talked
of
many
things
politics
in
chief
her
ladyship
views
were
tory
to
the
backbone
but
she
had
a
speculative
cynical
lightness
which
leavened
any
retrogressive
tendencies
gerard
often
disagreed
with
her
just
to
draw
out
her
views
she
loathed
the
radical
government
it
aroused
her
fiercest
sarcasms
and
contempt
how
could
such
a
class
of
people
she
argued
from
their
heredity
no
matter
what
clever
brains
they
had
have
the
right
qualities
in
them
to
enable
them
to
govern
england
how
could
they
with
personal
and
financial
axes
to
grind
possibly
concentrate
honestly
upon
the
welfare
of
the
country
above
their
own
necessities
it
was
quite
ridiculous
in
logic
whether
their
views
were
radical
or
tory
the
supreme
voice
in
the
government
of
a
country
should
only
be
in
the
hands
of
those
raised
by
their
position
above
all
temptation
for
merely
personal
aggrandisement
so
that
the
glory
of
the
country
could
be
their
legitimate
and
undivided
aim
it
could
not
be
that
the
little
browns
and
greens
with
their
parochial
lawyer
instincts
and
bitter
class
hatreds
greedy
for
their
salaries
and
own
advancement
could
rise
to
the
necessary
heights
of
sublime
prevision
to
enable
them
to
see
far
enough
ahead
to
have
the
final
decision
on
any
great
question
she
was
all
in
favour
of
the
most
advanced
views
for
the
advantage
and
raising
of
the
lower
classes
in
freedom
and
education
no
matter
from
which
side
they
emanated
but
she
resented
the
pushing
up
of
individuals
totally
unfit
in
integrity
of
character
for
the
positions
of
authority
they
occupied
and
who
year
after
year
were
exposed
as
having
in
some
way
lowered
the
standard
of
honour
in
their
office
she
would
receive
none
such
in
her
house
i
eat
with
no
one
who
lowers
the
prestige
of
my
country
in
the
eyes
of
other
nations
she
declared
making
us
a
in
europe
where
we
were
once
great
and
for
her
that
settled
matters
strobridge
coasted
warily
among
the
shoals
of
her
opinions
and
gradually
got
the
conversation
on
the
topic
of
the
pictures
in
the
gallery
some
of
which
she
really
thought
ought
to
be
sent
to
london
to
be
cleaned
had
gerard
noticed
lately
particularly
two
early
italians
this
was
a
most
fortunate
suggestion
strobridge
had
noticed
and
had
meant
to
speak
about
them
we
must
have
a
critical
examination
after
luncheon
while
the
light
is
good
one
ought
not
to
delay
over
such
matters
he
knew
incidently
that
his
aunt
was
going
to
drive
tom
hawthorne
into
the
town
in
her
phaeton
to
try
a
new
pair
of
cobs
which
she
had
bought
just
before
christmas
and
would
be
starting
the
moment
that
meal
was
finished
but
he
showed
just
the
right
amount
of
regret
and
surprise
when
she
informed
him
of
this
fact
never
mind
i
will
go
round
alone
or
better
still
if
you
could
spare
miss
bush
for
an
hour
i
will
get
her
to
make
shorthand
notes
of
what
i
think
should
be
done
to
each
picture
lady
garribardine
looked
at
her
nephew
shrewdly
his
face
was
innocent
as
a
babe
i
believe
miss
bush
would
make
quite
an
agreeable
companion
in
a
picture
gallery
she
remarked
i
am
sure
you
are
perfectly
right
then
they
both
laughed
you
wo
flirt
with
the
girl
will
you
and
turn
her
head
the
sad
part
of
the
affair
is
that
it
is
the
girl
who
is
more
likely
to
turn
my
head
her
own
is
far
too
well
screwed
on
upon
my
word
i
believe
you
well
then
innocent
of
do
be
beguiled
into
idiocy
by
this
competent
of
if
you
were
there
would
be
no
hope
for
you
but
a
glimmer
of
sanity
may
remain
in
the
thirties
she
attractive
seraphim
and
will
love
to
see
the
pictures
she
says
she
wants
to
learn
about
art
and
literature
and
kindred
things
and
you
have
offered
to
teach
her
strobridge
put
on
a
modest
air
while
his
humorous
grey
eyes
met
his
aunt
merrily
i
have
applied
for
the
post
of
tutor
with
no
salary
attached
she
wo
put
up
with
inefficiency
you
will
have
to
keep
your
wits
at
mark
then
i
feel
that
well
perhaps
you
deserve
a
treat
the
christmas
entertainment
i
had
provided
for
you
in
the
way
of
l√§o
fell
rather
flat
did
it
not
one
grows
tired
of
souffl√©
yes
but
do
not
forget
that
more
substantial
food
can
cause
shocking
indigestion
unless
partaken
of
with
moderation
heavens
seraphim
i
am
no
gourmand
gerard
my
dear
boy
you
are
at
a
stage
of
hunger
i
fear
when
intelligence
may
not
guide
discretion
you
see
nature
is
apt
to
break
out
after
years
of
artificial
repression
we
are
overcivilised
i
admit
at
that
moment
the
sounded
and
they
both
rose
from
their
chairs
lady
garribardine
slipped
her
fat
hand
into
her
nephew
arm
as
they
went
down
the
stairs
i
leave
the
afternoon
to
you
only
do
burn
your
fingers
irretrievably
this
young
woman
is
no
fool
like
poor
l√§o
i
look
upon
her
as
a
rather
marvellous
product
of
the
twentieth
century
chapter
xvii
after
lunch
the
two
in
the
picture
gallery
passed
a
perfectly
delightful
strobridge
had
sagacity
enough
to
know
that
he
must
stick
loyally
to
art
and
indeed
after
the
first
few
minutes
he
found
he
was
carried
away
himself
his
listener
was
so
interested
and
gave
such
intelligent
response
he
almost
began
to
believe
that
she
had
really
come
there
to
learn
something
and
not
to
flirt
with
himself
her
taste
also
surprised
him
and
her
want
of
all
pose
she
wrote
systematically
the
reflections
he
made
as
to
the
condition
of
the
canvases
it
is
a
great
thing
to
learn
how
to
look
at
pictures
she
said
when
they
halted
before
a
particularly
primitive
madonna
of
course
i
could
not
have
seen
anything
to
admire
in
this
if
i
had
come
by
myself
and
i
do
not
suppose
that
i
shall
ever
be
able
really
to
appreciate
it
except
the
colour
because
there
is
something
in
me
which
likes
the
real
so
much
better
than
the
ideal
i
like
prose
far
more
than
poetry
for
instance
will
you
let
me
come
up
again
to
the
schoolroom
and
read
to
you
some
day
i
should
like
that
very
much
i
would
try
to
make
you
love
poetry
you
are
endeavouring
to
convince
me
that
you
are
a
very
material
young
woman
you
know
well
i
suppose
i
am
material
i
like
facts
and
solid
things
and
yet
you
spoke
of
dreamland
once
not
so
very
long
ago
do
you
remember
yes
but
you
do
not
know
that
this
dreamland
of
mine
may
not
be
a
place
where
facts
and
solid
things
appear
realities
not
fancies
you
would
not
tell
me
if
i
asked
you
i
recollect
how
you
eluded
me
before
and
said
it
was
a
place
which
only
admitted
yourself
even
materialists
must
have
some
corner
where
they
can
be
alone
then
he
questioned
how
had
she
learned
all
that
she
knew
and
his
interest
did
not
diminish
when
she
gave
him
a
brief
outline
of
the
manner
of
her
education
it
was
very
difficult
sometimes
because
i
never
had
anyone
with
whom
to
talk
and
one
grows
one
has
only
oneself
to
argue
with
and
i
do
really
know
how
to
pronounce
numbers
of
words
i
should
be
grateful
if
you
would
tell
me
every
time
i
make
a
mistake
it
is
quite
evident
that
we
must
ratify
this
compact
that
i
shall
be
your
tutor
though
i
am
to
get
no
wages
even
love
who
would
be
supposed
to
give
the
love
her
strange
eyes
glanced
at
him
provokingly
for
a
second
and
then
resumed
their
steady
look
he
was
quite
uncertain
as
to
whether
in
this
there
lay
a
he
proceeded
to
act
as
if
there
did
when
i
come
up
to
give
my
first
lesson
i
will
tell
you
all
about
the
giving
and
taking
of
love
that
would
be
of
no
advantage
to
either
of
us
love
is
a
thing
which
can
cause
only
pain
you
are
quite
mistaken
it
is
the
only
divine
joy
in
this
unsatisfactory
world
her
face
changed
she
felt
this
was
cruelly
true
and
she
did
not
wish
to
be
reminded
of
the
fact
you
shall
only
come
to
the
schoolroom
if
you
talk
sense
i
will
not
listen
to
a
word
of
speculation
about
love
it
is
pure
waste
of
time
but
in
any
case
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
come
there
at
all
i
would
not
receive
you
without
her
ladyship
permission
it
was
very
kind
of
her
to
let
me
have
this
afternoon
what
a
circumspect
darling
miss
bush
looked
at
him
with
scorn
i
am
not
a
darlings
i
am
a
lower
middle
class
young
woman
trying
to
learn
how
to
be
a
lady
and
whatever
you
think
if
you
want
to
be
with
me
you
will
have
to
treat
me
as
if
i
had
arrived
at
my
goal
already
i
think
you
have
but
the
greatest
ladies
are
often
darlings
yes
but
married
men
do
not
tell
them
so
on
very
short
acquaintance
mr
strobridge
in
his
case
he
felt
this
was
rather
true
since
he
never
spoke
to
girls
at
all
if
he
could
help
it
he
suddenly
wondered
in
what
light
he
really
did
consider
her
as
an
abstract
and
quite
adorably
provoking
woman
he
supposed
is
there
anything
else
to
be
written
down
she
asked
she
had
become
the
conventional
secretary
because
if
not
i
must
go
back
to
my
work
my
aunt
gave
me
full
permission
to
keep
you
for
two
hours
i
told
her
all
we
had
to
do
would
take
quite
that
time
well
you
see
it
has
not
we
have
come
to
the
end
of
the
gallery
then
there
is
a
very
comfortable
sofa
not
too
far
from
the
fire
where
we
could
sit
down
and
discuss
what
we
have
learned
they
walked
to
it
as
long
as
he
was
being
of
some
use
to
her
katherine
bush
desired
his
company
so
they
talked
uninterruptedly
until
dusk
fell
and
the
footmen
would
soon
be
coming
to
close
shutters
and
draw
curtains
they
flitted
from
subject
to
subject
gerard
strobridge
exerting
his
brain
to
interest
and
amuse
her
in
a
way
that
he
had
seldom
done
with
englishwomen
even
of
his
own
class
her
receptive
power
was
exceptional
and
she
was
completely
frank
she
was
honestly
and
deeply
interested
in
all
he
had
to
say
and
the
subtle
flattery
of
this
was
eminently
soothing
he
began
to
take
pride
in
his
pupil
they
touched
upon
the
spirit
of
the
renaissance
and
its
origin
and
upon
all
the
glorious
flood
of
light
which
it
brought
to
art
and
learning
he
was
astonished
to
find
her
so
advanced
in
certain
branches
of
literature
and
absolutely
ignorant
of
the
names
even
of
others
showing
that
it
had
merely
been
chance
and
no
helping
hand
which
had
guided
her
i
must
send
you
some
books
upon
the
renaissance
he
said
if
you
will
let
me
that
will
be
very
kind
if
i
had
had
some
master
to
give
me
an
idea
what
to
read
as
a
kind
of
basis
to
go
upon
it
would
have
been
much
better
but
i
had
no
guide
only
if
i
saw
one
subject
that
i
did
not
know
about
mentioned
in
what
i
was
reading
i
looked
it
up
but
of
course
with
really
educated
people
there
must
be
some
plan
well
shall
we
begin
upon
the
renaissance
that
is
rather
a
favourite
period
of
mine
yes
do
you
not
wonder
if
we
shall
ever
have
another
what
a
lot
of
good
it
would
do
us
would
it
not
probably
some
learned
professors
think
that
we
must
go
through
a
second
series
of
dark
ages
first
when
we
shall
get
back
to
primitive
ideas
and
primitive
passions
it
may
be
nearly
everything
natural
is
distorted
now
the
world
seems
so
tired
to
me
just
looking
on
he
stretched
himself
and
threw
out
his
arms
as
it
were
to
break
some
imaginary
bonds
yes
we
have
been
coerced
into
false
morals
and
manners
and
we
have
suppressed
most
things
which
make
life
worth
having
sometimes
i
envy
the
beasts
i
never
do
that
it
is
only
weaklings
who
are
coerced
the
strong
do
what
they
please
even
in
these
days
but
however
strong
a
beast
may
be
he
always
finds
as
jack
london
shows
with
his
wonderful
in
call
of
the
wild
that
there
is
invariably
man
with
the
club
you
mean
to
conquer
fate
then
i
shall
do
my
very
best
to
obtain
my
desires
and
of
course
shall
have
to
pay
for
all
my
mistakes
he
looked
at
her
curiously
had
she
made
any
mistakes
not
many
he
thought
her
regard
was
so
serene
and
her
clever
strong
face
showed
no
vacillation
he
suddenly
faced
the
fact
that
he
was
falling
in
love
with
her
not
as
he
had
tried
to
do
with
l√§o
not
even
as
he
had
once
succeeded
in
doing
with
alice
southerwood
long
ago
there
was
a
quality
in
his
present
feeling
which
almost
frightened
him
it
was
so
lawless
she
felt
his
eyes
searching
hers
burningly
and
rose
from
the
sofa
now
i
am
going
to
have
my
tea
so
for
i
have
really
enjoyed
the
pictures
may
not
i
come
and
have
tea
with
you
i
am
all
alone
certainly
not
martha
would
be
scandalised
it
does
seem
so
extraordinary
that
i
should
have
to
tell
you
such
things
it
shows
either
great
disrespect
to
me
or
else
what
eagerly
he
had
risen
too
and
was
following
her
as
she
walked
down
the
long
that
you
can
not
help
yourself
yes
that
is
it
you
have
bewitched
me
in
some
way
i
can
not
help
myself
do
you
want
all
i
have
taken
down
typewritten
i
can
do
it
after
tea
if
so
and
you
will
sit
up
there
all
by
yourself
from
now
until
you
go
to
bed
of
course
you
must
feel
awfully
solitary
not
in
the
least
i
have
books
which
are
the
most
agreeable
companions
they
have
no
independent
moods
you
can
be
sure
of
them
and
pick
up
those
which
suit
yourself
and
she
turned
at
the
bend
of
the
great
staircase
from
which
the
gallery
opened
and
rapidly
walked
on
to
the
entrance
to
her
passage
he
looked
after
her
with
a
rapt
face
and
then
he
went
discontentedly
down
into
the
library
and
waited
for
his
aunt
return
he
was
extremely
disturbed
it
was
horribly
tantalizing
to
feel
that
this
girl
whom
he
was
so
passionately
drawn
to
was
there
in
the
house
with
him
and
that
he
might
not
talk
with
her
further
or
be
in
her
presence
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
and
those
who
knew
the
casual
gerard
strobridge
cultivated
polished
and
would
have
been
greatly
surprised
could
they
have
seen
his
agitated
pacings
lady
garribardine
had
a
quizzical
eye
when
she
finally
came
in
how
had
the
afternoon
progressed
her
opinion
of
the
mental
balance
of
her
secretary
was
exceedingly
high
she
felt
convinced
that
she
would
know
exactly
how
to
tackle
her
nephew
and
if
gerard
desired
to
amuse
himself
he
would
certainly
do
so
whether
she
smiled
upon
the
affair
or
not
it
did
strike
her
that
he
was
rather
a
dangerous
creature
to
be
left
a
free
hand
with
any
young
woman
and
that
after
she
would
see
that
katherine
ran
no
more
risks
from
too
much
of
his
company
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
were
rather
dilated
she
noticed
otherwise
he
seemed
his
usual
self
at
tea
and
when
colonel
hawthorne
left
them
alone
she
got
him
to
read
to
her
and
did
not
mention
her
secretary
at
all
the
afternoon
had
been
most
instructive
katherine
thought
as
she
ate
her
muffin
and
looked
at
the
papers
before
the
old
schoolroom
fire
she
had
learned
a
quantity
of
things
strobridge
was
undoubtedly
a
charming
man
and
she
wondered
what
effect
he
would
have
had
upon
her
if
she
had
never
met
algy
as
it
was
he
mattered
no
more
than
a
chair
or
a
table
he
was
just
part
of
her
game
and
he
was
rapidly
approaching
the
state
when
she
could
obtain
complete
dominion
over
him
he
knows
quite
well
that
he
is
married
and
that
i
can
never
honestly
be
anything
to
him
he
is
only
coming
after
me
because
he
is
attracted
and
is
not
master
of
his
passions
or
his
will
if
he
is
a
weakling
he
must
pay
the
price
i
shall
not
care
he
is
not
thinking
in
the
least
as
to
whether
or
no
it
will
hurt
me
he
is
only
thinking
of
himself
just
like
bob
hartley
only
he
is
a
gentleman
and
therefore
does
not
make
any
hypocritical
promises
to
try
to
lure
me
and
then
she
laughed
softly
well
whatever
comes
is
on
his
own
head
i
need
have
no
mercy
upon
him
so
she
calmly
finished
her
tea
and
wrote
to
matilda
whose
excited
letter
with
the
family
news
of
gladys
secret
marriage
she
had
not
yet
replied
to
gladys
had
written
her
a
little
missive
also
full
of
thanks
for
her
part
in
the
affair
bob
was
being
rather
rude
and
unkind
to
her
about
it
she
said
but
it
was
not
altogether
his
fault
because
on
christmas
night
he
had
had
rather
too
much
to
drink
and
had
been
quarrelsome
for
two
days
since
she
was
going
to
keep
the
expected
event
from
being
known
as
long
as
possible
and
then
she
supposed
they
would
go
and
live
somewhere
together
it
would
be
wretched
poverty
and
struggle
and
she
was
miserable
but
at
least
she
felt
an
honest
woman
and
could
not
be
grateful
enough
to
her
sister
for
bringing
this
state
of
things
about
katherine
stared
into
the
fire
while
she
thought
over
it
all
it
seemed
to
her
too
astonishing
that
a
woman
should
prefer
a
life
tied
to
a
man
who
was
reluctant
to
keep
her
his
drudge
and
the
object
of
his
scorn
to
one
of
her
own
arranging
in
america
perhaps
along
with
the
child
but
free
gladys
had
sufficient
talent
in
her
trade
to
have
earned
good
wages
anywhere
and
must
have
enough
money
saved
could
she
have
got
it
from
matilda
fond
guardian
clutches
to
have
tided
over
the
time
but
weaklings
must
always
suffer
and
be
other
people
slaves
and
tools
poor
gladys
then
she
fell
to
thinking
of
algy
why
was
he
haunting
her
for
the
first
month
the
complacent
satisfaction
from
the
conquest
of
self
had
upheld
her
splendidly
but
now
the
pain
felt
as
keen
as
on
the
first
day
of
separation
would
crush
except
on
the
path
coming
out
of
church
she
had
no
words
with
strobridge
on
the
morrow
and
then
it
was
only
a
few
sentences
of
ordinary
greeting
lady
garribardine
claimed
his
entire
attention
she
did
see
him
from
the
window
smoking
a
cigar
in
the
rose
garden
in
the
afternoon
whither
he
had
come
from
the
she
deliberately
let
him
catch
sight
of
her
as
she
stood
there
and
she
marked
the
look
of
eager
joy
on
his
face
and
then
she
moved
away
and
did
not
appear
again
so
the
monday
arrived
the
last
day
of
the
old
year
lady
garribardine
was
having
no
party
for
it
as
was
her
usual
custom
her
rheumatism
was
rather
troublesome
and
she
stayed
in
the
house
all
the
day
up
in
her
boudoir
where
katherine
was
in
constant
attendance
gerard
and
colonel
hawthorne
were
out
rabbiting
with
the
keepers
in
the
park
and
only
came
in
to
tea
katherine
found
her
mistress
rather
exacting
and
difficult
to
please
and
she
felt
tired
and
cross
so
it
gave
her
some
kind
of
satisfaction
to
be
as
provoking
as
possible
when
she
was
ordered
to
pour
out
the
tea
for
the
shooters
in
the
she
remained
perfectly
silent
but
every
now
and
then
allowed
her
magnetic
eyes
to
meet
with
the
sphinxlike
smile
in
them
on
his
side
gerard
had
found
the
hours
he
knew
he
was
now
madly
in
love
with
this
exasperating
girl
and
that
she
was
exercising
the
most
powerful
attraction
upon
him
he
gazed
at
her
as
she
sat
there
white
and
her
red
lips
pouting
and
her
eyes
full
of
some
unconscious
challenge
and
gradually
wild
excitement
grew
in
his
blood
as
soon
as
her
actual
duties
were
over
katherine
said
respectfully
if
your
ladyship
has
no
more
need
of
me
i
must
get
some
letters
finished
before
the
post
goes
and
when
a
nod
of
assent
was
given
she
quietly
left
the
room
so
gerard
strobridge
knew
he
would
see
her
no
more
that
night
and
there
would
be
a
boring
dinner
with
the
parson
and
his
wife
and
daughter
to
be
got
through
and
on
the
morrow
he
was
returning
to
town
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
he
felt
resentful
towards
his
aunt
that
seraphim
should
not
have
been
more
sympathetic
and
have
made
some
opportunity
for
him
to
talk
again
to
katherine
was
quite
too
bad
she
who
usually
understood
all
his
moods
and
wants
her
silence
upon
the
subject
of
her
secretary
ever
since
her
return
from
that
drive
was
ominous
now
that
he
thought
about
it
evidently
he
need
hope
for
no
further
co√∂peration
from
her
and
because
he
was
feeling
so
deeply
he
could
not
act
in
the
casual
and
intelligent
way
to
secure
his
ends
which
he
would
have
used
on
other
occasions
so
the
incredibly
wearisome
evening
passed
the
guests
left
early
and
lady
garribardine
went
gladly
to
bed
leaving
her
nephew
and
colonel
hawthorne
to
drink
in
the
new
year
together
the
new
year
of
but
the
old
gentleman
was
fatigued
with
his
day
shooting
and
when
eleven
came
he
was
glad
to
slink
off
to
his
friendly
couch
thus
gerard
was
alone
he
lit
a
cigar
and
stretched
himself
in
a
huge
leather
armchair
an
untouched
drink
close
at
hand
the
house
was
quite
silent
he
had
told
bronson
that
he
would
put
out
the
lights
in
the
when
they
left
no
one
was
about
and
not
a
breath
of
wind
stirred
a
tree
outside
he
sat
there
for
some
minutes
and
then
his
heart
began
to
beat
violently
whose
was
that
soft
footfall
directly
overhead
with
the
departure
of
the
grandchildren
from
the
old
nurseries
there
was
no
one
left
in
the
wing
but
katherine
bush
all
sorts
of
visions
came
to
him
she
had
not
yet
gone
to
bed
perhaps
she
too
was
waiting
for
the
new
year
he
got
up
and
listened
his
pulses
bounding
so
that
he
seemed
to
hear
his
heart
thumping
against
his
side
there
was
the
sound
again
it
was
not
to
be
endured
fierce
emotion
shook
him
and
at
last
all
restraint
fell
from
him
and
passion
became
lord
then
he
extinguished
the
lights
and
softly
crept
up
the
stairs
chapter
xviii
katherine
had
that
instant
removed
her
after
the
brushing
of
her
hair
which
now
hung
in
two
long
plaits
she
was
in
the
act
of
slipping
into
bed
the
carpet
in
the
passage
was
thick
and
she
heard
no
sounds
so
that
the
first
thing
which
startled
her
was
the
actual
opening
of
the
door
of
her
room
which
it
had
not
been
her
custom
to
lock
for
one
second
a
blind
terror
shook
her
and
then
all
her
nerve
and
resource
returned
she
stood
there
magnificent
in
her
anger
and
resentment
she
had
no
female
instinct
instantly
to
seize
the
to
cover
herself
she
stood
straight
up
in
her
cheap
nainsook
nightgown
all
the
beautiful
lines
of
her
tall
slender
figure
showing
in
the
soft
shaded
light
gerard
strobridge
was
like
a
man
drunk
with
wine
his
eye
flamed
and
he
trembled
with
excitement
the
bed
a
small
old
wooden
one
was
between
them
with
a
at
the
foot
so
that
to
reach
her
he
must
go
round
by
the
fire
this
he
did
while
he
whispered
hoarsely
katherine
i
love
you
madly
i
had
to
come
to
you
darling
girl
then
he
stopped
within
a
few
feet
of
her
literally
sobered
by
the
expression
of
her
face
it
showed
not
an
atom
of
fear
rather
the
proud
contempt
of
an
empress
ordering
the
death
of
a
presuming
slave
she
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
she
seemed
to
draw
up
to
her
full
height
and
even
to
grow
taller
she
was
only
an
inch
or
two
less
than
himself
and
if
the
scorn
of
eyes
could
kill
he
would
have
lain
there
dead
darling
he
cried
and
went
forward
to
take
her
in
his
arms
she
stepped
back
only
one
step
and
spoke
at
last
her
deep
tones
low
if
you
dare
to
touch
me
i
will
kill
you
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
you
know
you
are
only
a
beast
after
all
and
i
am
the
man
with
the
club
beautiful
fiend
but
he
hesitated
he
was
no
coward
and
cared
not
a
jot
for
her
threats
only
his
fastidiousness
was
assailed
by
the
thought
of
a
struggling
fighting
woman
in
his
embrace
when
he
had
come
there
for
love
it
would
be
wiser
perhaps
to
cajole
her
he
was
too
intoxicated
with
passion
to
realise
that
it
would
also
seem
more
dignified
katherine
do
not
be
so
horribly
unkind
darling
girl
i
love
you
wildly
i
tell
you
and
i
want
you
to
be
mine
what
for
she
was
perfectly
calm
still
and
never
moved
from
her
place
that
we
may
be
happy
you
sweet
thing
i
want
to
hold
you
in
my
arms
and
caress
you
and
make
us
both
forget
that
there
is
anything
else
in
the
whole
wide
world
but
our
own
two
selves
and
exalted
by
this
enchanting
picture
he
drew
a
little
closer
and
held
out
his
hands
i
tell
you
plainly
if
you
come
one
step
nearer
to
me
you
do
so
at
your
own
risk
i
will
tear
the
flesh
from
your
face
with
my
nails
and
strangle
you
her
voice
was
absolutely
deadly
in
its
icy
intentness
i
am
not
weak
and
i
despise
your
mean
action
in
coming
here
too
greatly
to
have
any
fear
the
breeding
in
him
responded
to
this
sting
my
mean
action
but
his
voice
faltered
a
little
and
she
interrupted
him
before
he
could
argue
further
yes
i
am
a
dependent
in
your
aunt
house
here
earning
my
living
and
you
chance
my
being
disgraced
and
sent
away
for
your
own
shamefully
selfish
ends
indeed
you
are
teaching
me
the
lesson
of
the
depth
to
which
an
aristocrat
can
sink
he
drew
back
and
some
of
the
fire
died
out
of
him
her
words
cut
him
like
a
knife
but
he
was
too
overwrought
with
emotion
yet
to
give
in
and
leave
her
katherine
my
darlings
forgive
me
he
cried
brokenly
i
admit
i
am
mad
with
love
but
you
shall
never
suffer
for
it
give
yourself
to
me
and
i
will
take
you
away
from
all
drudgery
you
shall
have
a
house
where
you
like
i
will
protect
you
and
teach
you
all
you
desire
to
know
you
shall
lead
an
intellectual
life
worthy
of
your
brain
we
can
travel
in
italy
and
france
and
i
shall
worship
and
adore
you
katherine
my
sweet
the
tones
of
his
cultivated
voice
vibrated
with
deep
feeling
and
he
looked
all
that
was
attractive
as
he
stood
there
in
his
faultless
evening
clothes
pleading
to
her
as
though
he
were
but
a
humble
suppliant
for
grace
and
she
a
queen
but
katherine
was
not
in
the
least
touched
although
her
awakened
critical
faculties
realised
fully
the
agreeable
companion
he
would
probably
make
as
a
lover
with
his
knowledge
of
the
world
and
his
polished
homage
to
women
there
was
something
fierce
and
savagely
primitive
at
this
moment
in
her
faithfulness
to
algy
for
all
the
strongly
sensuous
side
of
her
nature
any
other
man
caresses
appeared
revolting
to
her
it
was
not
who
could
arouse
her
passionate
sensibility
you
ask
me
to
be
your
mistress
then
is
that
it
her
voice
was
coldly
level
like
one
discussing
a
business
proposition
his
whole
face
lit
up
again
there
was
hope
perhaps
after
all
of
course
darling
what
else
it
is
an
insult
but
i
am
not
concerned
with
that
point
my
views
are
perhaps
not
orthodox
i
am
merely
interested
in
my
side
of
the
affair
which
is
that
i
have
not
the
slightest
wish
for
the
post
i
will
be
no
man
mistress
do
you
hear
katherine
can
i
not
make
you
love
me
sweet
she
laughed
softly
it
was
a
dangerous
sound
ominous
as
that
which
a
lioness
might
make
when
she
purrs
not
if
you
stayed
on
your
knees
for
a
thousand
years
i
have
loved
one
man
in
my
life
with
the
kind
of
love
which
you
desire
i
know
exactly
what
it
means
and
probably
i
shall
never
love
another
in
that
way
i
sacrificed
him
for
my
idea
i
had
will
enough
to
leave
him
feeling
for
him
what
perhaps
you
feel
for
me
so
do
you
think
then
that
you
could
move
me
in
the
least
you
whom
i
do
not
love
but
despise
all
this
time
she
stood
there
utterly
desirable
in
her
thin
raiment
which
she
had
never
sought
to
cover
indeed
now
that
she
saw
that
she
was
going
to
win
the
game
she
took
joy
that
he
should
understand
what
he
had
lost
so
that
his
punishment
should
be
the
more
complete
there
was
nothing
pitiful
or
tender
about
katherine
bush
her
strange
strong
character
had
no
mercy
for
a
man
who
had
shown
her
that
he
was
not
master
of
himself
above
all
things
she
admired
gerard
strobridge
suffered
as
she
spoke
as
perhaps
he
had
never
done
in
his
life
before
if
he
had
been
one
whit
less
of
a
gentleman
he
would
not
now
have
conquered
himself
he
would
have
seized
her
in
his
arms
and
made
her
pay
for
her
scalding
words
the
effect
of
tradition
for
centuries
however
held
him
even
beyond
the
mad
longing
which
again
thrilled
through
his
blood
as
he
looked
at
her
he
flung
himself
into
the
armchair
and
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
my
god
he
cried
hoarsely
how
you
can
torture
can
you
not
i
knew
when
i
watched
you
in
church
that
you
could
be
cruel
as
the
grave
but
i
thought
when
you
looked
at
me
there
in
my
aunt
that
to
me
perhaps
you
meant
to
be
kind
your
face
is
the
essence
of
passion
it
would
deceive
any
man
then
it
is
well
that
you
should
be
undeceived
and
that
we
should
understand
one
another
what
did
you
think
you
would
gain
by
coming
here
my
seduction
and
some
pleasure
for
yourself
she
was
horribly
scornful
again
you
never
thought
of
me
it
does
not
matter
what
my
personal
views
are
about
such
relations
you
do
not
know
them
and
i
do
not
believe
that
i
have
given
you
reason
to
think
that
you
might
treat
me
with
want
of
respect
but
your
action
shows
that
you
do
not
respect
me
i
can
only
presume
because
of
my
dependent
position
and
because
you
despise
my
class
since
you
would
certainly
not
have
behaved
so
to
any
of
your
aunt
guests
he
writhed
a
little
at
her
taunt
and
his
face
was
haggard
now
as
he
looked
up
at
her
there
is
no
use
in
my
asking
you
to
forgive
me
but
it
is
not
true
that
i
do
not
respect
you
or
that
i
have
acted
as
i
have
for
the
reason
that
i
despise
your
class
that
is
a
hateful
thought
i
came
here
because
i
am
a
man
and
was
simply
mad
with
longing
for
you
after
the
tantalization
of
the
last
two
days
and
never
being
able
to
speak
a
word
to
you
his
breath
came
rather
fast
and
he
locked
together
his
hands
i
love
you
i
would
have
come
had
you
been
the
highest
lady
in
the
land
my
action
was
not
premeditated
it
was
yielding
to
a
sudden
strong
temptation
because
i
was
sitting
there
in
the
thinking
of
you
and
i
heard
the
noise
of
your
soft
footfall
overhead
and
suddenly
all
the
furious
passion
in
me
would
no
longer
be
denied
and
cried
out
for
you
he
rose
and
came
over
to
her
and
sitting
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
he
held
out
his
arms
to
her
in
supplication
it
swept
away
all
the
civilisation
in
me
nature
breaks
asunder
all
barriers
in
the
best
of
us
at
times
and
you
are
so
adorably
dear
katherine
darling
i
have
done
this
thing
and
now
it
is
too
late
for
me
to
plead
for
your
pardon
but
i
love
you
more
wildly
than
i
have
ever
loved
a
woman
in
my
you
could
make
me
your
slave
katherine
if
you
would
only
give
yourself
to
me
i
would
chase
away
the
memory
of
that
other
and
teach
you
all
the
divine
things
of
love
there
are
to
learn
in
life
she
moved
and
stood
by
the
fireplace
she
was
shivering
a
little
half
from
cold
i
forbid
you
to
say
another
word
on
this
subject
she
said
gravely
but
with
less
of
her
former
scorn
neither
you
nor
any
other
man
could
rob
me
of
the
memory
of
my
once
dear
lover
but
i
would
rather
not
hate
you
so
i
appeal
to
that
part
of
you
that
i
still
think
is
a
gentleman
to
go
at
once
out
of
my
room
he
followed
her
to
the
fire
almost
overcome
again
by
the
picture
she
presented
in
her
straight
thin
garment
virgin
white
and
plain
he
wildly
desired
to
unplait
that
thick
soft
hair
and
bury
his
face
in
it
he
longed
to
hold
her
to
his
heart
but
he
restrained
himself
there
was
complete
silence
for
a
second
or
two
and
then
across
the
park
in
the
church
tower
midnight
pealed
tolling
the
dying
year
they
both
lifted
their
heads
to
listen
unconsciously
counting
the
strokes
and
then
when
the
last
one
struck
and
the
joyous
bells
rang
out
something
in
their
sound
melted
the
anger
and
contempt
in
katherine
soul
she
looked
at
him
his
refined
distinguished
face
very
pale
and
utterly
dejected
now
and
the
judgment
which
she
brought
to
bear
on
all
matters
told
her
that
she
had
no
right
to
great
anger
and
made
her
realise
for
the
first
time
that
she
was
actually
to
blame
perhaps
for
this
situation
having
developed
since
she
had
not
sufficiently
considered
what
might
be
the
possible
result
of
arresting
a
man
attention
through
the
eyes
and
ears
listen
she
said
gently
holding
out
her
beautiful
hand
here
is
the
new
year
i
do
not
want
to
begin
it
with
any
hard
thoughts
after
all
i
understand
you
and
i
forgive
you
i
believe
i
have
been
in
some
measure
to
blame
i
can
not
ever
be
your
love
but
i
am
very
lonely
wo
you
be
my
true
knight
and
friend
she
had
touched
the
deepest
chord
of
his
being
the
tears
sprang
to
his
fine
grey
eyes
he
knelt
down
upon
the
rug
and
bent
and
kissed
her
knees
indeed
i
will
i
swear
it
darling
and
whatever
suffering
it
brings
to
me
i
will
never
make
you
regret
your
sweet
forgiveness
of
me
and
your
resumed
trust
in
me
she
leaned
forward
and
for
an
instant
smoothed
his
thick
brown
hair
in
blessing
he
took
her
hands
and
kissed
the
palms
and
then
without
another
word
he
rose
and
went
towards
the
door
there
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
standing
in
the
firelight
the
dark
room
only
lit
by
the
one
small
lamp
by
the
bed
he
looked
and
looked
as
though
his
famished
eyes
must
surfeit
themselves
with
the
vision
it
was
fair
enough
to
see
and
then
he
noiselessly
quitted
the
room
and
went
on
down
the
stairs
to
the
as
silently
as
he
had
come
chapter
xix
the
months
went
by
it
was
easter
time
before
katherine
bush
again
saw
gerard
strobridge
he
went
off
to
egypt
about
the
middle
of
january
and
lady
garribardine
was
up
in
london
for
a
few
days
alone
before
he
left
seeing
her
grandchildren
off
katherine
missed
him
and
unconsciously
his
influence
directed
her
studies
she
remembered
isolated
sentences
that
he
had
used
in
their
talk
that
day
in
the
picture
gallery
he
had
certainly
shown
a
delightfully
cultivated
mind
and
she
wished
that
things
had
not
reached
a
climax
so
soon
between
them
she
regretted
deeply
that
she
had
caused
him
any
pain
and
determined
never
to
deviate
from
loyal
friendship
so
that
he
should
have
no
cause
to
suffer
further
he
had
not
forgotten
about
the
books
and
she
was
now
the
proud
possessor
of
several
volumes
on
the
renaissance
including
of
course
symonds
and
pater
they
opened
yet
another
door
in
her
imagination
and
on
days
when
she
was
not
very
busy
she
would
wander
in
the
picture
gallery
and
go
over
all
the
examples
of
the
italian
masters
again
and
again
and
try
to
get
the
atmosphere
of
the
books
lady
garribardine
watched
her
silently
for
the
first
few
weeks
after
her
nephew
went
without
increasing
their
intimacy
her
shrewd
mind
was
studying
katherine
to
make
sure
that
she
had
made
no
mistake
about
her
such
a
very
deep
creature
might
have
sides
which
would
make
her
regret
having
dropped
the
reserve
which
accompanied
by
a
kindliness
she
showed
to
all
her
dependents
the
great
event
of
new
year
day
had
been
the
advent
of
the
grey
wig
so
beautifully
arranged
with
her
ladyship
own
hair
that
the
whole
thing
seemed
growing
together
with
her
dark
sparkling
eyes
and
jet
brows
she
now
looked
an
extremely
handsome
old
lady
and
katherine
who
did
not
see
her
until
the
afternoon
when
they
were
alone
was
unable
to
keep
a
faint
almost
inaudible
ah
of
admiration
from
escaping
when
she
first
saw
her
she
was
furious
with
herself
and
bit
her
lip
but
lady
garribardine
smiled
you
would
say
something
miss
bush
pray
speak
katherine
coloured
a
little
she
felt
this
was
one
of
those
slips
which
she
very
seldom
made
but
frankness
being
always
her
method
she
answered
quietly
i
only
thought
how
beautiful
your
ladyship
looked
just
like
the
nattier
in
the
gallery
you
find
my
grey
locks
an
improvement
then
oh
yes
the
nattier
was
an
ancestress
of
a
french
entanglement
of
a
great
which
ended
as
these
affairs
are
seldom
fortunate
enough
to
do
in
a
marriage
all
correct
with
the
blessing
the
husband
being
most
conveniently
killed
in
a
duel
with
another
man
so
the
then
brought
her
here
to
blissington
where
she
was
shockingly
bored
poor
thing
and
died
a
year
or
two
after
producing
an
heir
for
him
when
i
was
young
i
always
went
to
fancy
balls
as
the
charming
creature
it
is
amusing
that
you
see
the
likeness
even
now
it
is
very
striking
i
always
felt
a
great
pity
for
her
transplanted
from
versailles
and
all
the
joys
of
the
court
to
this
quiet
english
home
have
you
ever
read
lord
chesterfield
letters
to
his
son
girl
katherine
had
not
well
then
you
had
better
read
them
there
is
a
good
edition
in
the
library
they
are
you
will
find
the
most
instructive
things
in
english
literature
if
i
had
had
a
son
i
would
have
brought
him
up
upon
them
i
was
reminded
of
them
now
by
thinking
of
my
twice
chesterfield
always
quotes
the
french
nobles
of
that
date
as
the
plus
of
good
breeding
and
rather
suggests
that
the
englishmen
were
often
boors
or
blockheads
so
although
may
have
satisfied
her
the
general
company
could
not
have
done
so
one
feels
i
would
like
to
see
versailles
katherine
ventured
to
remark
you
will
some
day
i
may
go
to
paris
after
easter
one
must
have
clothes
katherine
realised
this
necessity
her
own
wardrobe
would
require
replenishing
by
the
springtime
but
she
had
not
dreamed
of
paris
her
immediate
action
after
this
was
to
get
from
the
library
the
chesterfield
letters
the
reading
of
which
she
always
afterwards
looked
back
upon
as
being
the
second
milestone
in
her
career
she
devoured
them
and
learned
countless
advantageous
lessons
of
the
world
therefrom
the
first
and
chief
being
the
value
of
graciousness
and
good
manners
she
now
began
to
realise
that
her
own
were
too
sullen
and
abrupt
and
a
marked
change
in
them
was
soon
perceivable
to
anyone
who
would
have
cared
to
notice
this
was
during
the
time
when
she
was
still
only
on
probation
in
her
employer
favour
but
it
was
not
lost
upon
that
astute
lady
nothing
ever
escaped
her
eagle
eye
and
she
often
smiled
to
herself
quietly
when
she
watched
the
girl
now
and
then
they
would
go
up
to
the
london
house
for
a
few
days
and
picnic
as
her
ladyship
called
it
which
meant
taking
only
her
personal
footman
to
wait
on
her
and
a
maid
or
two
for
the
house
katherine
went
with
her
nearly
always
and
was
sent
shopping
and
allowed
to
go
and
see
her
family
if
she
wished
but
she
did
not
wish
and
always
met
matilda
at
some
place
for
tea
the
gulf
between
them
was
growing
wider
and
wider
and
while
katherine
was
far
more
agreeable
than
of
old
matilda
stood
in
much
greater
awe
of
her
she
felt
although
she
would
not
have
owned
it
for
the
world
that
her
sister
had
really
gone
into
another
class
and
she
was
not
quite
comfortable
with
her
katherine
seemed
to
look
more
stately
and
refined
each
time
and
matilda
gloried
and
grieved
in
secret
over
it
gladys
accompanied
her
on
one
occasion
i
suppose
kitten
will
be
marrying
one
of
them
gentlemen
some
day
matilda
said
on
the
way
home
to
laburnum
villa
you
never
know
she
was
someone
now
would
you
glad
no
she
is
quite
like
any
of
our
thing
lot
who
came
into
ermantine
they
dowdy
but
you
know
they
were
it
well
i
hope
she
be
happy
matilda
sighed
doubtfully
yes
she
will
gladys
returned
a
little
bitterly
katherine
would
never
do
anything
to
get
herself
into
a
mess
she
is
quite
just
and
she
can
be
awfully
kind
but
she
looks
to
the
end
of
things
and
does
care
a
rush
for
anyone
but
sticks
to
what
she
wants
herself
i
tell
you
what
tild
i
used
to
hate
her
but
i
do
now
i
respect
katherine
she
is
so
perfectly
true
she
seems
to
talk
different
do
you
notice
glad
she
always
did
but
now
more
than
ever
she
is
like
our
best
lot
i
suppose
she
did
learn
something
extra
at
those
evening
classes
she
was
so
fond
of
matilda
shook
her
head
regretfully
i
never
did
hold
to
them
she
have
been
happy
at
home
now
and
engaged
to
charlie
prodgers
all
comfortable
but
for
that
nonsense
oh
but
tild
i
expect
what
she
has
got
is
better
even
than
that
what
to
be
a
grand
lady
servant
glad
my
i
far
rather
be
prodgers
junior
a
lady
myself
and
keep
my
own
general
forever
saying
katherine
ca
be
anything
but
a
slave
and
mabel
knows
her
cousin
aunt
daughter
who
married
that
gentleman
with
the
large
city
business
was
presented
at
court
but
bob
hartley
only
sighed
life
was
growing
particularly
grim
for
her
just
now
she
felt
horribly
ill
and
had
to
stand
about
all
day
and
conceal
every
sensation
to
keep
up
the
appearances
that
all
was
fair
katherine
reflected
deeply
upon
the
moral
of
the
situation
after
her
sisters
had
left
her
what
martyrs
many
women
were
in
life
and
what
hideous
injustice
it
all
seemed
and
more
than
ever
she
saw
how
merciless
nature
is
to
weaklings
about
three
weeks
before
easter
lady
garribardine
was
alone
down
at
blissington
she
had
lately
taken
to
having
her
secretary
with
her
sometimes
on
her
frequent
visits
to
her
cottagers
she
would
start
in
a
rough
short
suit
and
a
pair
of
thick
boots
with
a
serviceable
and
would
tramp
for
miles
carrying
a
basket
in
which
were
sweets
and
medicines
she
was
worshipped
by
her
people
arrogant
commanding
kindly
great
lady
on
one
of
these
occasions
they
had
the
motor
to
meet
them
at
the
end
of
the
home
village
and
drove
six
or
seven
miles
to
another
in
her
outlying
property
she
was
very
gracious
as
they
went
along
what
books
have
you
been
reading
lately
girl
if
they
are
the
chesterfield
letters
i
think
i
may
tell
you
that
you
have
profited
by
them
your
manners
generally
are
greatly
improved
katherine
reddened
with
pleasure
i
have
read
them
over
and
over
again
i
have
found
them
more
instructive
to
me
than
any
other
book
in
my
young
days
they
were
considered
highly
immoral
and
pernicious
by
most
of
the
canting
victorian
hypocrites
when
of
course
everyone
of
the
world
knew
that
chesterfield
advice
on
all
points
was
the
most
sensible
and
sagacious
that
could
be
given
but
hypocrisy
had
risen
to
a
colossal
height
in
the
sixties
and
seventies
i
suppose
so
nowadays
not
one
person
in
ten
thousand
reads
them
more
the
pity
if
the
young
men
with
their
great
personal
beauty
which
sport
and
suitable
feeding
have
produced
could
have
been
brought
up
to
understand
the
advantage
of
cultivating
graces
what
godlike
creatures
they
would
be
katherine
thought
of
lord
algy
he
must
have
done
so
unconsciously
she
felt
people
are
so
apt
to
judge
such
a
book
upon
the
letter
not
the
spirit
naturally
one
must
make
allowances
for
the
different
customs
and
habits
of
the
times
but
the
spirit
of
the
advice
adapted
to
modern
requirements
would
make
any
man
or
woman
into
an
eminent
person
if
it
was
faithfully
followed
i
recommend
it
to
you
strongly
since
i
believe
you
are
steadily
trying
to
educate
yourself
miss
bush
i
am
indeed
i
hope
i
am
not
overconfident
in
believing
that
if
one
probes
the
meaning
of
everything
and
can
see
the
faults
in
oneself
including
those
of
instinct
it
is
possible
to
do
by
will
what
only
the
evolution
of
centuries
accomplishes
by
natural
process
the
chesterfield
letters
have
encouraged
me
in
my
belief
of
course
it
is
possible
but
people
will
hardly
ever
face
the
truth
and
would
not
dream
of
examining
their
own
instincts
it
would
wound
their
they
would
rather
be
mediocre
and
blinded
to
their
stupidities
than
teach
themselves
any
useful
lesson
your
determined
effort
interests
me
deeply
child
katherine
turned
a
radiant
face
of
gratitude
this
was
praise
indeed
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
merit
your
ladyship
goodness
to
me
no
i
am
not
good
i
have
no
altruistic
or
humanitarian
proclivities
i
would
not
bother
with
you
for
five
minutes
if
you
were
not
so
intelligent
that
i
have
grown
to
take
a
kind
of
pride
in
you
i
ca
say
how
i
appreciate
your
ladyship
kindness
lady
garribardine
turned
and
looked
at
her
for
a
second
and
then
she
said
slowly
i
am
going
to
ask
you
a
question
not
strictly
justifiable
and
you
need
not
answer
it
if
you
would
rather
not
but
you
may
have
formed
some
opinion
of
my
integrity
in
these
months
which
will
perhaps
allow
you
to
be
frank
with
me
did
my
nephew
gerard
strobridge
make
violent
love
to
you
when
he
spent
christmas
with
us
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
and
afterwards
that
he
grew
considerably
depressed
katherine
felt
a
twinge
of
distress
strobridge
showed
some
interest
in
me
which
i
felt
it
wiser
to
discourage
he
was
very
kind
to
me
though
and
agreed
to
be
my
friend
and
sent
me
some
books
for
a
second
lady
garribardine
felt
irritated
her
precious
gerard
to
have
been
a
suppliant
to
this
dependent
in
her
house
and
then
the
broad
justice
of
her
nature
regained
its
mastery
the
girl
was
worthy
of
the
homage
of
a
king
i
think
he
must
have
been
extremely
hard
hit
i
am
quite
devoted
to
him
as
you
know
i
rely
upon
you
not
to
hurt
him
more
than
you
can
help
when
he
comes
back
i
never
wished
to
hurt
him
at
all
i
did
wish
to
talk
to
him
though
because
he
is
so
clever
so
at
first
i
was
glad
to
attract
his
attention
i
know
now
that
that
was
wrong
lady
garribardine
looked
at
her
secretary
critically
she
was
astonished
at
this
frank
avowal
which
she
realised
not
another
woman
in
a
million
in
katherine
situation
would
have
made
you
deliberately
attracted
him
then
girl
eh
her
voice
was
stern
yes
on
the
afternoon
he
first
spoke
to
me
when
we
typed
the
charity
papers
i
was
so
anxious
to
learn
about
books
and
art
and
before
that
he
had
not
noticed
me
at
all
you
did
not
calculate
that
it
might
hurt
him
lady
garribardine
wondered
at
herself
that
she
did
not
feel
angry
no
i
never
thought
about
that
he
seemed
older
and
of
the
world
and
able
to
take
care
of
himself
and
he
was
married
none
of
which
things
ever
saved
a
man
when
eve
offered
the
apple
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
very
annoyed
with
you
child
but
i
believe
it
has
done
him
good
he
wanted
rousing
he
is
as
you
say
so
clever
he
could
have
done
brilliantly
but
he
is
lacking
in
perseverance
if
he
had
married
a
woman
like
you
he
would
have
risen
to
great
things
the
finest
gift
of
god
is
an
indomitable
purpose
my
nephew
drifted
i
fear
then
their
talk
branched
off
to
other
things
and
this
proud
old
aristocrat
having
made
up
her
mind
now
once
for
all
that
katherine
possessed
a
character
and
qualities
after
her
own
heart
she
from
this
day
treated
her
as
an
equal
and
a
valued
companion
whenever
they
were
not
in
actual
relation
of
employer
and
secretary
when
in
that
she
would
always
resume
her
original
aloof
manner
of
one
in
command
katherine
delighted
in
this
and
appreciated
the
subtle
tribute
to
her
own
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
and
never
once
took
the
ell
when
she
was
given
the
inch
showing
in
this
the
immeasurable
distance
she
had
risen
above
her
class
and
so
easter
came
and
with
it
a
large
party
and
gerard
strobridge
at
first
sight
he
did
not
appear
at
all
changed
katherine
saw
him
from
the
window
of
the
schoolroom
just
at
sunset
on
the
thursday
afternoon
when
the
guests
arrived
he
was
walking
in
the
rose
garden
with
a
tall
beautiful
woman
the
lowering
globe
of
fire
was
making
a
blaze
of
reflected
light
from
striking
the
row
of
mullioned
windows
of
the
picture
gallery
on
the
opposite
side
and
the
were
a
mass
of
daffodils
and
hyacinths
it
was
a
nice
background
he
looked
up
so
katherine
saw
his
face
plainly
then
she
stepped
behind
the
curtain
and
the
pair
went
on
she
felt
very
glad
to
see
him
and
wondered
when
they
would
meet
at
these
huge
parties
she
never
came
down
even
to
pour
out
the
tea
if
her
ladyship
hand
ached
as
at
the
smaller
family
christmas
one
so
unless
he
made
the
chance
deliberately
it
was
quite
possible
no
words
would
be
exchanged
this
uncertainty
added
to
the
interest
and
made
her
decide
when
sunday
should
come
to
take
especial
pains
with
her
appearance
for
church
under
gladys
direction
she
would
be
most
simply
and
charmingly
garbed
in
a
new
blue
serge
suit
and
becoming
black
hat
before
saturday
when
they
actually
met
however
she
had
seen
gerard
twice
once
from
the
gallery
as
she
was
leaving
lady
garribardine
and
he
was
talking
to
the
same
beautiful
lady
in
the
hall
and
once
from
her
window
when
he
paced
the
rose
garden
alone
katherine
was
familiar
with
the
names
and
characteristics
of
all
the
guests
for
had
she
not
written
their
invitations
and
read
their
answers
did
she
not
type
the
cards
which
slipped
into
the
little
plates
on
their
doors
and
those
for
their
places
at
dinner
and
on
saturday
night
a
message
came
for
her
that
she
was
to
print
two
more
and
go
immediately
to
bronson
with
a
fresh
arrangement
of
the
table
as
two
extra
men
were
going
to
turn
up
by
motor
at
the
last
moment
guardsmen
quartered
at
windsor
she
was
coming
from
the
down
the
passage
which
led
to
her
staircase
and
also
the
when
gerard
emerged
from
there
and
met
her
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
put
out
his
hand
with
cordial
friendliness
while
he
cried
gaily
at
last
i
can
greet
you
i
would
not
go
to
dress
on
purpose
because
i
saw
you
rush
down
the
passage
and
i
knew
you
would
have
to
come
back
it
is
good
to
see
you
again
she
answered
suitably
and
would
have
passed
on
only
he
barred
the
way
i
thought
you
were
going
to
let
me
be
a
friend
he
said
reproachfully
and
here
you
snub
me
at
once
and
want
to
run
away
no
but
you
will
be
late
i
care
not
a
jot
when
can
i
possibly
see
you
his
eyes
began
to
grow
hungry
he
was
taking
in
the
subtle
improvement
in
her
which
had
happened
even
in
these
few
months
his
interest
in
her
had
not
diminished
he
discovered
much
as
he
had
hoped
that
he
had
crushed
it
to
within
bounds
i
can
not
say
in
church
i
suppose
that
is
small
comfort
may
i
not
come
up
the
stairs
just
for
half
an
hour
before
lunch
yes
if
you
find
it
possible
remember
i
trust
you
not
to
do
anything
unwise
i
promise
if
you
prefer
it
i
will
ask
my
aunt
permission
do
as
you
think
best
but
now
i
must
go
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
his
lips
were
burning
then
he
watched
her
as
she
went
up
the
stairs
never
looking
back
and
a
sudden
anguish
came
over
him
how
hopeless
the
whole
thing
was
he
had
better
not
have
relied
upon
his
and
have
stayed
away
he
did
not
go
to
church
on
the
sunday
katherine
rather
wondered
at
this
as
she
walked
back
alone
across
the
park
in
the
country
lady
garribardine
expected
the
inmates
of
her
house
to
be
very
orthodox
the
fine
spring
wind
had
blown
two
faint
pink
roses
into
her
cheeks
by
the
time
she
reached
the
schoolroom
and
there
found
strobridge
seated
in
her
favourite
armchair
reading
a
book
he
rose
eagerly
as
she
entered
but
he
did
not
shake
hands
i
thought
possession
would
be
nine
points
of
the
law
so
i
ensconced
myself
here
and
awaited
you
and
i
am
going
to
stay
until
you
turn
me
out
very
well
that
will
be
at
ten
minutes
to
one
at
five
minutes
to
thomas
comes
to
lay
the
table
for
my
lunch
that
gives
us
just
under
half
an
hour
katherine
you
beautiful
thing
let
me
look
at
you
and
now
he
took
both
her
hands
and
pulled
her
to
the
light
you
have
grown
much
prettier
you
know
and
are
more
attractive
than
ever
alas
if
you
are
going
to
talk
like
that
although
you
may
stay
i
shall
leave
you
alone
no
i
am
going
to
be
reasonable
tell
me
everything
what
you
have
been
doing
and
reading
and
thinking
since
i
went
away
i
have
been
doing
my
work
and
reading
all
the
books
you
gave
me
and
many
others
and
thinking
about
life
never
once
of
me
i
suppose
yes
you
are
part
of
my
life
my
one
friend
he
started
forward
darl
but
he
checked
himself
before
the
word
came
quite
out
and
said
instead
ah
that
is
joy
to
hear
and
now
i
want
to
know
what
you
thought
of
symonds
and
pater
and
the
rest
you
will
have
quantities
of
things
to
discuss
with
me
i
am
sure
katherine
began
taking
off
her
hat
and
coat
and
then
put
them
neatly
on
the
long
hard
sofa
she
never
glanced
in
the
glass
or
patted
her
hair
she
was
boyish
in
her
unconsciousness
gerard
strobridge
watched
her
and
then
suddenly
looked
away
the
insane
desire
was
rising
in
him
again
to
take
her
in
his
arms
so
he
exerted
extra
control
over
himself
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
time
in
truly
friendly
converse
in
which
he
assumed
the
character
of
stern
tutor
examining
a
promising
pupil
upon
a
holiday
task
performed
in
his
absence
katherine
was
enchanted
and
when
ten
minutes
to
one
came
she
wished
he
had
not
to
go
it
has
given
me
so
much
pleasure
to
talk
to
you
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
back
but
she
held
her
hands
behind
her
when
he
would
have
taken
them
again
in
gladness
at
her
words
so
much
touching
is
undesirable
if
we
are
going
to
remain
friends
she
told
him
when
may
i
come
again
you
must
arrange
that
after
tea
just
until
it
is
getting
dark
enough
for
martha
to
be
coming
to
draw
the
curtains
yes
perhaps
and
with
this
he
left
comforted
but
when
he
had
gone
katherine
bush
went
and
looked
out
of
the
window
and
very
slowly
shook
her
head
in
perplexity
it
will
certainly
hurt
him
and
what
will
her
ladyship
say
she
may
think
i
am
not
playing
the
game
and
then
she
remembered
lord
chesterfield
advice
in
one
of
his
maxims
when
a
man
of
sense
happens
to
be
in
that
disagreeable
situation
in
which
he
is
obliged
to
ask
himself
more
than
once
what
shall
i
do
he
will
answer
himself
nothing
when
his
reason
points
out
to
him
no
good
way
or
at
least
no
one
way
less
bad
than
another
he
will
stop
short
and
wait
for
light
chapter
xx
katherine
bush
always
looked
back
upon
that
easter
party
as
being
the
third
milestone
in
her
career
it
happened
that
a
certain
guest
wished
to
try
some
new
songs
she
was
going
to
sing
on
sunday
night
and
instead
of
the
agreeable
gloaming
gerard
strobridge
had
been
looking
forward
to
enjoying
with
katherine
alone
he
was
forced
by
his
aunt
to
take
this
lady
up
to
the
schoolroom
after
tea
and
request
miss
bush
services
as
accompanist
katherine
had
been
practising
her
old
gift
of
reading
music
almost
every
evening
when
alone
and
was
now
very
proficient
lady
garribardine
knew
this
because
she
had
sent
for
her
secretary
to
play
to
her
several
times
in
her
when
she
was
there
without
visitors
and
was
suffering
from
rheumatism
strobridge
introduced
katherine
to
the
visitor
who
turned
out
to
be
the
beautiful
lady
he
had
walked
with
in
the
rose
garden
and
they
got
on
extremely
well
it
was
the
first
time
katherine
had
ever
chatted
as
practically
an
equal
alone
with
a
member
of
society
except
her
employer
the
stranger
was
charming
and
insisted
that
she
should
come
down
to
play
again
in
the
after
dinner
another
occasion
for
the
black
frock
to
be
worn
and
a
chance
not
to
be
wasted
for
observation
as
to
behaviour
katherine
when
evening
came
made
herself
look
her
very
best
and
was
waiting
demurely
by
the
piano
as
the
ladies
entered
the
room
from
this
position
she
attracted
no
attention
until
some
of
them
wanted
to
play
the
guest
she
had
accompanied
was
again
graciously
sweet
to
her
and
some
of
the
others
joined
in
the
conversation
while
they
strummed
and
pulled
about
the
songs
there
was
something
arresting
in
katherine
type
which
called
for
notice
when
people
were
near
enough
to
observe
details
of
her
mousy
fair
hair
that
had
no
touch
of
gold
in
it
but
always
glistened
grey
and
her
wonderfully
pale
skin
and
dark
brows
giving
her
strange
eyes
that
intense
shadowed
mystery
which
aroused
interest
gerard
who
joined
the
party
by
the
piano
when
the
men
came
in
watched
her
silently
she
had
studied
to
obtain
an
air
of
distinction
and
gerard
whose
love
did
not
blind
his
fastidious
critical
faculties
remarked
that
there
was
a
real
advance
in
this
direction
since
the
christmas
night
when
he
had
last
seen
her
in
evening
dress
she
did
not
look
so
sullen
either
and
answered
with
fluency
and
ease
when
she
was
addressed
and
not
in
the
monosyllabic
fashion
of
former
days
an
elderly
politician
spoke
to
her
he
seemed
delighted
with
her
conversation
and
indicated
by
a
gesture
that
she
should
sit
down
beside
him
when
the
songs
were
over
and
she
was
about
to
slip
away
out
of
the
room
katherine
was
not
at
all
certain
whether
she
ought
to
stay
or
not
but
lady
garribardine
at
that
moment
came
up
and
said
casually
you
must
not
go
to
bed
yet
miss
bush
perhaps
they
will
sing
again
wait
here
and
talk
to
sir
john
and
so
bidden
katherine
was
delighted
to
obey
and
used
her
intelligence
to
be
agreeable
and
sympathetic
gerard
continued
to
watch
her
and
felt
pride
in
her
your
secretary
is
having
a
great
success
is
she
seraphim
he
said
to
his
aunt
yes
and
it
is
deserved
the
girl
is
one
in
a
thousand
i
think
i
shall
encourage
sir
john
for
her
he
is
longing
for
a
wife
and
has
a
tidy
seven
thousand
a
year
and
only
rare
attacks
of
gout
she
could
manage
him
capitally
and
be
of
real
use
to
the
party
she
will
never
let
her
heart
interfere
with
her
ambitions
he
would
make
an
ideal
husband
strobridge
tone
was
sardonic
a
lover
in
that
case
would
be
an
immediate
necessity
by
all
means
seraphim
press
the
match
her
ladyship
gave
him
one
of
her
shrewd
glances
and
then
she
said
come
and
breakfast
with
me
in
my
morning
we
can
talk
it
over
and
she
chuckled
softly
when
katherine
sat
by
her
fire
an
hour
later
she
set
herself
to
look
carefully
over
the
last
five
months
of
her
life
and
to
mark
what
they
had
brought
her
the
gain
was
immense
she
had
emerged
from
being
an
ordinary
shorthand
typist
at
liv
and
dev
to
be
an
inmate
of
the
house
in
berkeley
square
and
from
that
to
be
the
passion
of
gerard
strobridge
and
the
valued
companion
of
lady
garribardine
at
blissington
and
now
she
had
spent
the
evening
almost
as
their
equal
and
had
heard
twenty
eminent
people
all
talking
the
shibboleth
of
the
great
world
of
politics
and
fashion
and
had
not
felt
totally
out
of
place
in
their
company
which
she
knew
was
not
composed
of
the
agreeable
fools
of
the
christmas
party
but
contained
several
politicians
of
distinction
a
diplomat
or
two
and
a
foreign
ambassador
the
contrast
was
delightful
to
think
about
it
even
gave
her
pleasure
to
recall
bindon
green
as
a
foil
she
laughed
without
any
bitterness
to
herself
when
she
remembered
the
bath
and
the
oyster
incidents
and
several
others
of
the
lord
algy
period
and
how
she
had
secretly
admired
the
rather
awful
rooms
at
the
great
terminus
hotel
her
eye
and
her
taste
then
so
totally
uneducated
that
in
spite
of
many
walks
in
museums
she
had
not
been
able
to
distinguish
her
deplorable
deficiencies
in
both
respects
oh
what
an
immeasurable
gulf
now
separated
her
from
those
days
it
was
a
praiseworthy
achievement
for
only
five
months
but
she
realised
more
than
ever
from
the
conversations
she
had
heard
that
she
was
still
very
ignorant
and
that
constant
mixing
with
this
society
would
be
the
only
way
to
give
her
that
polish
and
confidence
which
could
enable
her
to
display
the
really
cultivated
thoughts
of
her
mind
the
quickness
and
lightness
with
which
subtle
and
clever
sallies
were
answered
the
perfect
ease
of
everyone
she
knew
that
she
was
able
to
control
her
own
face
and
manner
to
appear
at
ease
but
she
could
not
pretend
that
she
felt
so
altogether
as
yet
except
with
gerard
strobridge
but
then
gerard
while
her
literary
master
was
her
worshipping
servant
so
that
was
different
to
please
companies
of
women
must
now
be
her
aim
and
to
avoid
talking
to
any
attractive
men
at
all
until
she
had
obtained
such
a
sure
place
that
the
jealousy
of
her
own
sex
would
be
immaterial
to
her
she
had
observed
that
lady
elton
whose
songs
she
had
accompanied
had
a
distinct
penchant
for
strobridge
unreturned
she
knew
but
it
behooved
her
to
be
more
particularly
careful
another
woman
who
had
also
spoken
to
her
a
bosanquet
was
really
interesting
about
fifty
and
highly
intelligent
katherine
had
carefully
watched
how
she
led
the
conversation
in
the
group
where
she
stood
as
a
company
all
these
ladies
were
much
gentler
and
more
refined
in
manner
than
some
of
those
who
had
assisted
at
the
tableaux
she
gathered
from
their
remarks
that
they
rather
held
themselves
apart
from
these
others
and
indeed
laughed
at
them
there
were
sets
within
sets
evidently
and
this
was
the
very
inner
de
la
katherine
wondered
how
long
it
would
be
before
some
distinct
goal
presented
itself
that
would
be
for
fate
to
decide
and
only
those
who
had
made
themselves
fit
to
profit
by
fate
chances
could
hope
to
succeed
in
such
a
difficult
game
as
she
was
playing
with
every
prejudice
of
class
and
sex
against
her
there
was
no
time
to
be
wasted
in
any
foolish
relaxations
she
wondered
if
lady
garribardine
had
approved
of
her
behaviour
the
old
gentleman
she
had
talked
to
had
been
intelligent
if
pompous
and
she
had
enjoyed
their
discussion
she
thought
of
the
chesterfield
letters
of
what
great
use
they
had
been
to
her
she
saw
the
pitfalls
they
had
enabled
her
to
avoid
now
her
next
immediate
aim
must
be
to
come
down
into
the
as
frequently
as
she
was
allowed
she
determined
to
make
herself
of
great
use
and
if
she
had
the
chance
to
tackle
any
bore
so
that
her
mistress
should
feel
that
she
was
of
real
service
at
last
she
retired
to
bed
well
pleased
with
her
evening
when
strobridge
came
into
his
aunt
next
morning
he
found
her
in
a
charming
neglig√©e
and
cap
pouring
out
the
coffee
i
could
not
wait
for
you
she
told
him
sit
down
quickly
there
are
only
two
dishes
besides
bacon
and
eggs
chicken
curry
and
devilled
sole
they
are
all
on
the
table
at
your
elbow
they
chatted
of
several
things
the
party
principally
now
i
have
time
to
hear
how
it
fares
with
l√§o
how
did
you
escape
with
dignity
or
rather
in
disgrace
she
believes
she
threw
me
over
it
is
extremely
fortunate
beatrice
was
an
invaluable
help
strobridge
put
some
chutney
in
his
curry
l√§o
and
i
are
the
greatest
friends
she
feels
that
i
fought
hard
with
my
inclinations
and
made
a
noble
conquest
by
absenting
myself
in
egypt
now
she
is
greatly
amused
with
a
hussar
boy
at
home
on
leave
from
india
she
must
be
older
than
one
thought
his
aunt
laughed
delightedly
it
is
a
bad
sign
certainly
l√§o
is
ageless
though
anything
between
and
we
stay
like
that
for
years
and
then
suddenly
grow
ridiculous
i
believe
you
have
extricated
me
from
the
appearance
of
that
at
all
events
my
new
toup√©e
has
given
me
a
new
perspective
you
are
quite
beautiful
now
seraphim
my
golden
ones
were
a
habit
it
has
been
a
source
of
great
gratification
to
me
to
watch
how
my
friends
have
taken
the
alteration
even
miss
bush
made
a
faint
exclamation
when
she
first
saw
it
she
is
usually
very
that
girl
is
a
wonder
have
you
anything
to
tell
me
about
her
nothing
except
that
i
agree
with
you
that
she
is
the
most
naturally
intelligent
creature
i
have
ever
met
are
you
in
love
with
her
dear
boy
yes
extremely
to
the
point
of
unhappiness
i
have
not
analysed
the
point
but
it
is
bound
to
be
unhappiness
since
she
does
not
care
one
atom
for
me
you
burnt
your
fingers
that
day
in
the
picture
gallery
then
it
was
a
pity
i
let
you
the
fire
was
lit
before
that
i
think
it
was
better
that
it
flared
up
now
i
am
trying
to
settle
down
into
being
friends
seraphim
i
want
to
help
her
i
do
so
admire
her
courage
and
her
profound
common
sense
she
frankly
desires
to
cultivate
her
mind
and
improve
in
every
way
the
change
in
her
even
since
christmas
is
remarkable
do
be
kind
to
her
and
let
her
come
down
sometimes
as
you
did
last
night
i
intend
to
lady
garribardine
helped
herself
to
honey
i
am
going
to
take
her
to
paris
with
me
next
week
and
then
we
shall
be
in
london
there
it
will
be
more
difficult
seraphim
have
i
your
permission
really
to
teach
her
things
her
ladyship
laughed
her
bubbling
laugh
it
quite
depends
what
things
to
love
you
a
married
man
certainly
not
to
improve
her
own
intellect
perhaps
it
is
alas
to
do
the
latter
dearest
of
aunts
but
and
here
his
voice
vibrated
with
unwonted
feeling
i
tell
you
frankly
that
if
i
did
not
know
that
the
case
is
perfectly
hopeless
and
that
i
could
never
succeed
in
making
her
care
for
me
i
believe
i
would
brave
even
your
wrath
and
attempt
to
win
her
as
what
your
mistress
rather
tartly
strobridge
shrugged
his
shoulders
slightly
i
would
marry
her
willingly
if
beatrice
would
divorce
me
such
things
can
be
arranged
yes
beatrice
is
an
excellent
creature
as
you
often
say
but
since
miss
bush
will
have
none
of
you
you
had
better
stick
to
beatrice
she
has
done
you
so
many
good
turns
think
of
l√§o
then
as
she
saw
the
look
of
pain
and
weariness
upon
his
face
she
got
up
and
did
what
she
had
perhaps
not
done
for
quite
ten
years
she
put
her
kind
arm
round
his
neck
and
pulled
his
head
back
against
her
ample
bosom
dearest
boy
she
whispered
softly
i
can
not
bear
that
anything
should
really
hurt
you
what
course
is
the
right
one
to
pursue
so
that
you
shall
not
have
more
pain
we
must
think
it
out
he
was
deeply
touched
and
rested
there
comforted
by
her
fond
affection
let
me
see
her
now
and
then
in
peace
without
subterfuge
so
that
i
may
help
her
with
her
education
and
then
in
the
autumn
i
think
i
will
take
that
chance
of
being
sent
to
teheran
seraphim
do
you
remember
the
afternoon
she
typed
the
charity
things
when
i
came
up
to
tea
with
you
you
said
i
was
depressed
and
i
said
it
was
the
shadow
of
coming
events
well
how
true
it
has
proved
that
is
the
first
time
i
ever
noticed
her
and
once
before
you
had
remarked
that
you
feared
i
should
one
day
be
profoundly
in
love
lady
garribardine
stooped
and
kissed
his
forehead
alas
she
said
but
you
were
too
fine
dear
to
go
on
drifting
forever
from
the
alice
southerwoods
to
the
l√§os
it
was
bound
to
come
with
your
temperament
i
really
wish
you
could
marry
this
girl
and
have
some
splendid
little
sons
for
me
to
adopt
and
leave
some
of
my
money
to
i
would
ask
nothing
better
of
fate
and
his
eyes
became
suffused
with
light
at
the
thought
his
aunt
sat
down
again
and
began
peeling
an
apple
you
would
have
no
objection
to
that
despised
domestic
relationship
then
it
would
not
even
appear
bourgeois
eh
not
in
the
least
how
the
whole
world
is
full
of
shams
this
ridiculous
thing
called
marriage
what
a
problem
and
no
light
on
the
subject
a
suitable
marriage
is
perfect
happiness
the
obligations
are
joys
and
pleasures
and
it
does
not
seem
to
be
allowed
to
occur
more
than
once
in
a
hundred
years
all
the
rest
are
in
gradations
of
unsuitableness
and
fret
and
boredom
it
makes
me
shudder
now
when
i
see
people
standing
at
the
altar
swearing
to
love
forever
of
them
not
even
taking
in
the
meaning
of
the
vows
they
are
making
and
a
large
percentage
going
through
them
for
some
ultimate
end
entirely
disconnected
with
love
or
desire
for
the
partner
they
are
being
bound
to
it
is
tragic
strobridge
agreed
i
am
convinced
her
ladyship
went
on
now
warmed
to
her
subject
that
much
unhappiness
would
be
avoided
if
no
vows
were
made
at
all
but
the
parson
merely
joined
the
hands
and
said
a
prayer
over
them
to
ask
that
they
might
go
on
desiring
each
other
and
that
ended
the
business
i
believe
truly
that
the
actual
breaking
of
the
vow
acts
in
some
mysterious
occult
fashion
and
draws
penalties
of
misery
upon
the
breakers
what
a
disturbing
thought
yes
because
it
is
not
really
the
infidelities
which
can
be
sins
they
are
merely
human
nature
it
is
the
breaking
of
the
given
word
which
draws
the
current
of
disaster
i
expect
you
are
quite
right
the
whole
thing
is
infernal
and
yet
we
must
have
some
sort
of
union
recognised
by
the
state
or
chaos
would
ensue
obviously
and
as
marriage
now
stands
there
seem
to
be
only
three
ways
of
supporting
it
one
and
she
ticked
them
off
on
her
fat
fingers
to
grow
to
that
abstract
state
of
good
when
to
keep
a
vow
against
inclination
in
itself
brings
happiness
two
to
behave
decently
to
the
legal
partner
and
with
propriety
before
the
world
and
then
if
necessary
to
have
mistresses
or
lovers
as
the
case
may
be
or
three
for
the
state
to
allow
a
man
to
have
several
wives
and
the
woman
if
she
desires
it
a
change
of
husbands
strobridge
handed
his
cup
for
more
coffee
most
of
us
are
quite
out
of
the
running
for
the
first
the
third
would
be
unworkable
seraphim
so
i
see
no
help
for
it
the
second
course
is
the
only
possible
one
for
half
the
poor
devils
in
the
world
probably
then
the
greatest
pains
ought
to
be
taken
to
keep
up
appearances
so
that
those
who
live
up
to
the
first
may
not
have
their
feelings
outraged
no
one
should
show
a
bad
public
example
the
facts
of
straying
fancy
can
not
be
altered
until
human
nature
changes
an
unlikely
event
so
the
best
we
can
do
is
to
hide
irregularities
under
a
cloak
of
virtuous
hypocrisy
it
helps
many
good
and
weak
people
to
keep
up
a
general
standard
but
there
must
be
something
wrong
in
the
original
scheme
if
we
are
obliged
to
do
this
undoubtedly
it
is
the
one
however
which
has
kept
all
sensible
societies
going
since
the
beginning
of
civilisation
and
will
continue
to
do
so
while
there
are
two
sexes
in
the
world
but
all
this
does
not
help
me
in
my
present
case
of
being
madly
in
love
with
a
woman
whom
i
may
not
have
as
either
wife
or
mistress
friendship
is
the
only
cold
comfort
left
to
me
tut
tut
half
a
loaf
is
better
than
no
bread
you
think
she
might
marry
sir
john
there
was
hope
in
his
tone
why
not
only
i
do
feel
sure
that
he
deserves
such
a
prize
for
me
she
is
quite
a
marvellous
character
and
we
could
perhaps
find
her
something
young
and
handsome
strobridge
jumped
up
with
a
start
this
idea
was
altogether
unpalatable
to
him
how
shocking
seraphim
that
might
be
a
creature
a
woman
would
adore
well
well
concentrate
upon
friendship
my
dear
boy
if
she
has
once
said
you
nay
the
r√¥le
of
lover
is
not
for
you
no
matter
whom
she
marries
chapter
xxi
time
passed
a
year
went
by
after
this
with
a
gradual
but
unmistakable
upward
advance
on
the
part
of
katherine
bush
moments
of
depression
and
discouragement
came
of
course
but
her
iron
will
carried
her
beyond
them
all
would
go
well
for
a
while
and
then
would
come
a
barrier
as
it
were
which
was
difficult
to
climb
and
which
would
baffle
her
intentions
for
a
week
or
two
and
then
she
would
surmount
it
and
race
onward
her
manipulation
of
gerard
strobridge
was
masterly
she
never
permitted
him
to
go
beyond
the
bounds
of
friendship
and
he
gradually
grew
to
entertain
the
deepest
worship
and
respect
for
her
which
influenced
his
whole
life
she
spurred
him
on
in
his
career
while
obtaining
from
him
all
the
polish
his
cultivated
mind
could
bestow
lady
garribardine
watched
the
passage
of
events
with
her
wise
old
eyes
assisting
them
moreover
when
she
deemed
it
necessary
if
katherine
dominion
over
her
beloved
nephew
was
for
his
good
she
must
not
let
class
prejudice
stand
in
the
way
of
her
sympathy
the
world
for
sarah
garribardine
was
full
of
incredible
fools
who
however
strong
their
desire
might
be
for
a
given
end
were
yet
too
stupid
to
see
that
their
actions
and
methods
nearly
always
inspired
by
personal
vanity
militated
against
the
attainment
of
that
end
and
so
they
went
on
their
blundering
way
continually
surprised
at
their
own
want
of
success
it
was
the
quality
of
reasoning
and
of
analysis
in
her
secretary
which
grew
to
interest
her
most
deeply
katherine
was
her
perpetual
study
inasmuch
as
she
stood
so
far
apart
from
the
world
of
fools
their
visit
to
paris
had
been
a
great
experience
for
katherine
she
took
the
place
historically
not
as
she
had
taken
it
before
as
the
setting
for
a
love
dream
she
had
had
a
recurrence
of
the
violent
longing
for
lord
algy
when
they
arrived
at
the
gare
du
nord
that
strangely
sudden
seizure
of
passion
to
which
she
seemed
periodically
subject
when
she
knew
that
if
at
the
moment
fate
were
to
offer
him
to
her
again
she
would
find
the
temptation
of
acceptance
too
strong
to
resist
she
was
afterwards
always
extremely
thankful
that
this
did
not
occur
and
that
she
was
given
time
to
resume
her
when
first
she
drove
down
the
champs
elys√©es
a
strange
sense
of
fear
came
over
her
what
if
after
all
that
palatial
hotel
episode
in
her
life
should
have
power
one
day
to
raise
up
its
ghost
and
destroy
the
fabric
of
her
ambitions
the
more
she
saw
of
the
great
world
the
more
she
realised
that
such
a
breach
of
convention
such
a
frank
laying
aside
of
all
recognised
standards
of
morality
would
never
be
forgiven
if
discovered
incidents
of
the
kind
occurred
every
day
but
must
always
be
rigorously
kept
out
of
sight
she
grew
to
understand
that
it
is
a
much
more
punishable
offence
to
hold
unorthodox
views
and
act
honestly
by
them
than
to
profess
orthodox
stringent
virtue
and
continually
blink
at
the
acting
against
conscience
by
secret
indulgences
one
day
it
chanced
that
she
could
discuss
the
point
with
her
mistress
you
must
remember
the
good
of
the
community
always
first
girl
lady
garribardine
had
said
if
you
want
to
benefit
humanity
you
must
not
be
too
much
occupied
with
the
individual
for
the
good
of
the
community
certain
standards
must
be
kept
up
and
sensible
people
should
put
on
blinkers
when
examining
the
frailties
of
human
nature
nature
says
one
thing
and
civilisation
and
orthodox
morality
another
there
must
logically
be
an
eternal
conflict
going
on
between
the
two
and
the
only
chance
for
souls
to
achieve
orthodox
morality
is
for
hypocrisy
to
assist
them
by
hiding
bad
examples
given
when
nature
has
had
an
outburst
and
won
the
game
if
you
wo
conform
to
these
practical
rules
it
is
wiser
and
less
harmful
to
your
neighbours
for
you
to
go
and
live
in
the
wilds
i
am
all
for
i
am
all
for
the
uplifting
of
the
soul
where
it
is
possible
and
decency
and
good
taste
where
it
is
not
i
see
responded
katherine
one
must
in
this
as
in
all
other
things
look
to
the
end
you
have
indeed
said
it
her
ladyship
cried
that
faculty
is
the
quintessence
of
statesmanship
as
it
is
of
wisdom
and
one
we
never
see
displayed
by
a
radical
government
as
the
season
went
on
in
london
various
peeps
at
society
were
afforded
katherine
and
as
her
eyes
opened
and
the
keenness
of
her
understanding
developed
she
learned
many
useful
lessons
on
rare
saturday
afternoons
she
visited
the
museums
again
with
gerard
strobridge
to
her
intense
delight
and
with
much
pain
as
well
as
pleasure
to
him
and
when
the
big
saturday
to
monday
parties
came
down
to
blissington
lady
garribardine
often
found
her
secretary
invaluable
for
the
entertainment
of
unavoidable
bores
thus
by
the
autumn
when
gerard
aching
soul
and
denied
passions
thought
to
take
solace
in
flight
on
that
mission
to
teheran
katherine
bush
was
an
established
institution
at
tea
time
and
had
acquired
the
art
of
conversation
in
a
degree
which
would
have
pleased
chesterfield
himself
to
make
herself
liked
by
women
was
the
immediate
objective
she
had
laid
down
for
herself
of
what
use
to
gain
the
little
pleasure
by
the
way
of
the
gratification
of
her
vanity
from
the
incense
of
men
she
must
wait
until
some
one
man
appeared
upon
the
scene
the
securing
of
whom
would
be
her
definite
goal
then
she
could
pursue
her
aims
without
the
of
female
antagonism
she
learned
many
things
from
her
employer
tolerance
kindness
of
heart
supreme
contempt
for
all
shams
apart
from
that
of
necessary
moral
hypocrisy
which
seeming
paradox
she
grew
to
realise
was
a
sensible
assistance
to
the
attainment
of
a
general
moral
ideal
her
wits
sharpened
her
brain
expanded
her
cultivation
increased
and
her
manners
assumed
an
exquisite
refinement
and
graciousness
and
when
the
second
christmas
came
and
the
new
year
of
no
one
could
possibly
have
discovered
the
faintest
trace
of
bindon
green
or
of
the
lower
middle
class
from
which
she
had
sprung
lady
garribardine
had
materially
augmented
her
salary
and
substantial
cheques
found
their
way
to
poor
gladys
whose
baby
was
born
dead
much
to
matilda
disappointment
but
it
is
often
like
that
she
told
katherine
as
they
walked
in
the
park
one
sunday
with
a
seven
months
child
and
glad
do
take
on
about
it
as
i
should
robert
hartley
was
firmly
determined
to
go
to
america
we
had
enough
hell
in
these
few
months
bob
she
informed
her
husband
as
she
was
getting
better
and
i
am
going
to
be
like
katherine
and
make
a
career
for
myself
i
tired
of
your
grumbling
and
your
rudeness
to
me
and
every
bit
of
love
i
had
for
you
is
gone
we
no
baby
there
nothing
to
keep
us
chained
up
together
like
a
pair
of
animals
and
i
off
to
make
my
fortune
so
i
tell
you
flat
robert
hartley
asserted
the
rights
of
an
english
husband
but
to
no
avail
gladys
had
the
money
from
her
sister
in
her
hand
to
start
herself
with
and
a
warm
recommendation
from
madame
ermantine
and
so
in
the
early
autumn
sailed
for
new
york
and
almost
immediately
obtained
lucrative
employment
thus
the
family
at
bindon
green
was
reduced
to
matilda
ethel
and
the
two
young
men
and
still
further
diminished
in
the
new
year
by
the
marriage
and
retirement
to
a
villa
of
his
own
of
frederick
bush
with
the
genteel
mabel
cawber
the
wedding
of
the
pair
was
a
day
of
unalloyed
pleasure
to
matilda
katherine
had
manoeuvred
so
that
she
could
not
possibly
be
spared
to
attend
it
thus
the
festivities
were
unclouded
by
the
restraint
which
her
presence
quite
undesired
by
herself
always
imposed
upon
her
relations
they
were
all
admittedly
uncomfortable
with
her
not
she
with
them
they
felt
in
some
vague
way
that
they
were
of
less
account
in
their
own
eyes
when
in
her
company
and
that
an
impassable
gulf
now
separated
them
they
had
nothing
to
complain
of
katherine
gave
herself
no
airs
she
neither
patronised
them
nor
talked
over
their
heads
but
a
subtle
something
divided
them
and
all
were
glad
of
her
seemingly
enforced
absence
all
except
the
bride
who
was
sorry
the
poor
secretary
should
not
be
chastened
by
witnessing
her
triumph
for
was
she
not
having
four
bridesmaids
dressed
in
pink
pongee
silk
with
blue
sashes
and
two
pages
to
carry
her
court
train
pages
in
renaissance
costume
the
lady
agatha
tollington
were
so
described
in
the
and
why
should
not
hers
be
also
renaissance
she
did
not
know
what
the
word
meant
but
it
had
such
a
nice
sound
and
seemed
so
well
to
fit
the
picturesque
suits
advertised
as
copied
from
immortal
bubbles
which
had
been
secured
at
the
local
emporium
to
adorn
the
two
infants
who
would
carry
very
shamefacedly
it
must
be
admitted
the
confection
of
cheap
satin
and
imitation
lace
which
would
depend
from
miss
cawber
angular
shoulders
if
katherine
could
have
seen
all
that
miss
cawber
felt
that
a
humbler
mien
in
this
obstreperous
creature
might
have
resulted
but
katherine
never
saw
it
and
when
matilda
recounted
all
the
glories
to
her
she
had
the
awkwardness
to
ask
why
mabel
had
indulged
in
a
court
train
bridesmaids
were
natural
enough
she
said
if
you
all
wanted
to
have
some
gaiety
and
a
jolly
party
but
fred
wife
will
never
go
to
court
so
why
pages
and
a
train
oh
well
matilda
returned
in
annoyance
who
to
know
that
at
bindon
green
and
it
has
given
her
ever
such
a
position
to
begin
her
home
upon
the
perkins
girls
and
bob
hartley
mother
and
cousins
were
just
mad
with
envy
and
fred
as
pleased
as
punch
to
have
such
a
stunning
at
his
side
to
down
the
aisle
with
i
am
so
glad
you
are
all
happy
then
katherine
said
kindly
how
merciful
she
reflected
when
she
had
left
her
sister
at
stanhope
gate
that
their
ambitions
were
so
easily
satisfied
how
merciful
also
that
only
matilda
affection
for
her
need
count
in
her
future
connection
with
the
family
and
matilda
might
at
no
distant
date
be
a
bride
too
the
bride
of
katherine
old
devoted
admirer
charlie
prodgers
while
ethel
announced
her
intention
of
following
example
and
migrating
to
america
the
moment
she
was
seventeen
in
the
spring
thus
visits
to
bindon
green
were
no
longer
desired
by
the
inhabitants
of
laburnum
villa
nor
of
talbot
lodge
where
and
frederick
bush
were
installed
and
katherine
felt
she
could
drift
from
them
all
without
hurting
their
feelings
indeed
with
mutual
satisfaction
so
the
winter
of
drew
to
a
close
and
the
spring
of
came
and
with
it
gerard
strobridge
he
was
well
and
sunburnt
and
seemed
more
resigned
on
his
first
visit
after
he
returned
to
blissington
accompanied
by
lady
beatrice
katherine
was
pouring
out
the
tea
now
her
daily
task
when
he
came
in
and
a
glad
thrill
ran
through
her
would
he
see
any
change
in
her
would
he
be
pleased
with
her
advancement
he
was
her
friend
and
her
helpmate
in
literature
and
never
by
word
or
look
did
she
recognise
that
he
could
feel
any
other
emotion
but
a
platonic
one
for
her
her
attractions
always
struck
gerard
afresh
after
his
absences
and
made
him
remark
upon
them
each
time
he
returned
how
beautiful
you
have
grown
katherine
he
said
when
presently
they
had
a
chance
of
talking
a
little
apart
you
are
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
the
world
i
came
back
hoping
to
find
you
less
attractive
and
you
are
just
as
fascinating
as
ever
more
so
oh
shall
i
never
make
you
care
the
least
for
me
never
it
is
a
wonder
that
i
should
love
you
so
madly
when
you
are
as
cold
as
ice
to
me
and
never
melt
i
believe
you
could
see
me
on
the
rack
without
turning
a
hair
if
it
suited
your
purpose
probably
but
she
smiled
softly
so
he
asked
eagerly
is
it
so
katherine
will
you
never
understand
even
after
the
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
talks
we
have
had
i
have
marked
out
a
settled
determined
path
in
life
which
i
intend
to
follow
so
that
even
if
i
loved
you
i
would
crush
all
emotion
out
of
myself
since
indulging
in
it
would
ruin
my
aims
and
drag
us
both
to
social
perdition
meanwhile
it
is
extremely
fatiguing
to
have
to
recommence
explaining
our
positions
every
time
you
come
back
from
abroad
as
a
friend
i
delight
in
you
i
love
our
talks
our
discussions
and
controversies
i
have
tried
in
every
way
to
improve
under
your
tuition
but
if
you
will
be
weak
and
give
way
to
other
feelings
it
is
you
who
put
yourself
on
the
rack
and
if
you
do
it
i
can
not
help
it
it
can
not
change
my
determination
even
if
i
see
you
suffering
how
can
a
man
worship
anything
so
logical
i
do
know
what
i
do
know
is
that
i
never
mean
to
admit
that
you
have
any
feelings
for
me
but
those
i
have
for
you
of
warm
friendship
i
shall
always
act
as
if
you
were
only
my
friend
and
only
consider
any
of
my
actions
as
affecting
you
from
that
point
of
view
if
you
are
hurt
it
is
your
own
fault
i
can
not
be
responsible
for
the
pain
he
clenched
his
hands
with
sudden
violence
and
if
i
refused
to
bear
it
if
i
broke
all
friendship
and
never
spoke
to
you
again
what
then
you
would
be
quite
right
to
do
so
if
it
gave
you
any
satisfaction
i
should
miss
you
but
i
should
understand
he
gave
a
faint
groan
well
i
have
not
the
strength
to
throw
off
your
influence
i
always
think
i
have
done
it
when
i
go
to
foreign
climes
and
i
dwell
upon
the
pleasure
that
your
intellect
gives
me
i
come
back
quite
resigned
but
the
first
sight
of
you
the
sight
of
those
red
wicked
lips
and
that
white
skin
drives
me
mad
once
more
and
i
feel
i
do
not
care
whether
you
have
any
brain
or
no
in
the
overwhelming
desire
to
hold
you
in
my
arms
katherine
gave
an
exclamation
of
weariness
oh
it
is
tiresome
that
you
must
always
have
these
scenes
when
you
return
they
spoil
everything
you
force
me
to
seem
cruel
why
ca
you
accept
the
situation
because
i
am
a
man
and
you
are
a
woman
and
his
eyes
sought
hers
with
passion
and
all
the
rest
of
emotion
is
but
the
only
real
part
is
the
tangible
to
have
and
to
hold
to
clasp
and
to
kiss
to
strain
the
loved
one
next
the
heart
katherine
you
make
me
suffer
the
tortures
of
the
damned
no
you
permit
yourself
to
suffer
them
that
makes
all
the
difference
if
i
made
you
then
i
should
feel
as
wicked
as
you
say
my
lips
look
here
lady
beatrice
interrupted
them
in
her
plaintive
drawling
voice
gerard
can
you
imagine
it
aunt
sarah
has
just
had
a
letter
from
tom
hawthorne
by
the
evening
post
announcing
that
l√§o
has
quietly
married
that
boy
in
paris
and
they
are
going
to
monte
carlo
for
their
honeymoon
is
it
quite
too
tragic
for
them
poor
things
lady
garribardine
joined
the
group
with
the
epistle
in
her
hand
l√§o
was
always
a
fool
but
i
believed
even
the
sense
of
a
rabbit
would
have
kept
her
from
this
they
are
madly
in
love
dear
sarah
old
gwendoline
said
sentimentally
her
ladyship
snorted
tut
tut
l√§o
is
years
old
and
the
boy
not
more
than
six
and
twenty
sixteen
years
between
them
quite
an
immaterial
discrepancy
while
he
remained
a
lover
but
a
menace
which
even
the
strongest
brain
can
not
combat
when
the
creature
turns
into
a
husband
the
situation
is
ridiculous
at
once
it
means
that
the
woman
has
to
spend
her
time
not
only
fighting
old
age
as
we
all
have
to
do
but
watching
for
every
sign
of
weariness
in
the
youth
trembling
at
every
fresh
wrinkle
in
herself
and
always
on
the
tiptoe
of
anxiety
so
that
she
loses
whatever
charm
lured
the
poor
child
into
her
net
but
really
l√§o
had
made
it
so
evident
the
affair
perhaps
she
thought
that
a
second
wedding
ring
was
essential
ridiculous
nonsense
gwendoline
we
are
not
of
the
there
is
an
epidemic
of
these
rich
widows
rushing
these
penniless
young
men
into
matrimony
no
one
objects
to
their
amusing
themselves
but
these
respectable
unions
offend
the
sensibilities
at
once
from
their
obvious
unsuitableness
the
woman
loses
prestige
almost
caste
i
was
going
to
say
the
man
grows
either
sheepish
or
intolerably
insolent
and
if
you
notice
the
pair
eventually
drop
out
of
all
agreeable
society
how
awful
to
contemplate
and
lady
beatrice
sighed
sadly
to
think
that
after
one
had
for
years
that
one
was
full
of
emotions
and
sex
and
horrible
things
one
should
succumb
to
them
really
it
is
a
cruel
retribution
gerard
are
you
interested
for
strobridge
had
raised
a
whimsical
eyebrow
perfectly
thrilled
i
am
amply
revenged
for
her
indifference
to
me
is
it
not
possible
for
them
to
be
happy
then
katherine
whispered
to
him
in
the
din
of
a
chorus
of
remarks
the
news
had
provoked
they
have
about
a
hundred
to
one
chance
for
a
few
months
then
either
will
suffer
probably
both
oh
the
intolerable
bond
of
matrimony
unless
of
course
katherine
shrugged
her
shoulders
yes
i
suppose
so
if
one
was
not
quite
sure
what
the
reason
was
that
one
was
marrying
for
and
had
not
weighed
it
and
found
out
if
it
would
be
worth
while
or
no
what
will
you
marry
for
contentment
i
expect
and
what
is
contentment
only
the
obtaining
of
one
heart
desire
i
shall
not
marry
unless
it
is
to
obtain
my
heart
desire
and
that
sphinxlike
smile
grew
round
her
mouth
which
always
roused
gerard
strobridge
curiosity
after
all
this
time
he
could
never
quite
fathom
what
was
going
on
inside
that
clever
brain
i
refuse
to
think
about
it
let
us
talk
about
something
else
books
you
have
been
reading
something
i
can
do
for
you
there
is
one
thing
i
would
like
you
to
do
very
much
only
i
do
not
know
if
it
could
be
managed
last
week
her
ladyship
allowed
me
to
go
with
miss
arabella
to
see
the
house
of
commons
i
would
so
much
like
to
see
the
house
of
lords
and
hear
a
debate
there
before
the
easter
recess
i
am
trying
to
study
politics
that
will
not
be
very
difficult
i
can
get
an
order
from
blackrod
there
will
be
something
to
listen
to
next
week
when
i
believe
my
aunt
will
be
in
town
i
shall
love
to
gratify
your
wish
katherine
we
must
ask
lady
garribardine
first
if
i
may
model
of
circumspection
of
course
then
the
company
drifted
from
the
tea
table
and
miss
bush
returned
to
her
sanctum
while
gerard
strobridge
went
up
to
his
aunt
they
talked
of
numbers
of
things
and
at
last
that
lady
said
more
than
ever
i
understand
your
passion
for
my
secretary
i
do
not
even
find
your
fidelity
ridiculous
she
is
one
of
the
most
fascinating
creatures
i
have
ever
met
a
masterpiece
of
balance
and
common
sense
she
will
rise
to
the
highest
position
one
day
mark
my
words
boy
i
daresay
i
can
not
feel
interested
in
that
i
am
still
horribly
in
love
i
thought
teheran
had
dulled
the
ache
for
her
but
it
has
not
lady
garribardine
sighed
as
she
arranged
a
cushion
i
live
in
terror
that
one
day
she
will
come
and
tell
me
quite
honestly
that
she
has
learned
all
that
my
situation
can
teach
her
and
that
she
is
going
on
to
something
new
she
could
not
be
so
ungrateful
it
would
not
be
ingratitude
she
works
for
money
not
for
love
it
would
be
part
of
her
plan
of
life
sentimental
emotion
does
not
enter
into
it
that
is
what
makes
her
so
interesting
and
so
invaluable
but
i
know
seraphim
that
she
has
a
deep
affection
for
you
she
has
expressed
it
to
me
many
times
you
are
her
model
for
all
fine
conduct
and
point
of
view
yes
the
girl
is
devoted
to
me
i
think
well
we
must
hope
that
she
is
content
here
for
i
do
not
know
how
i
could
quite
get
on
without
her
i
have
had
her
down
for
a
little
at
each
party
during
the
winter
she
literally
devours
bores
for
me
and
gets
all
the
cranks
into
good
tempers
and
all
the
women
like
her
that
shows
triumphant
astuteness
on
her
part
triumphant
you
did
not
after
all
marry
her
to
sir
john
while
i
was
away
i
almost
hoped
that
you
would
do
so
when
i
left
in
october
sir
john
was
willing
he
wanted
but
a
hint
from
me
to
have
shown
all
the
ardour
of
a
young
lover
one
even
pictured
verses
it
is
in
this
way
that
it
takes
aged
politicians
one
imagined
a
discreet
wedding
and
almost
by
now
the
inevitable
preparatory
layette
but
miss
bush
would
have
none
of
it
when
i
approached
her
upon
the
subject
she
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
and
said
quite
respectfully
but
with
a
hauteur
befitting
a
that
she
had
other
views
and
while
sensible
of
my
kindness
she
must
decline
the
honour
i
was
immensely
diverted
danger
is
still
ahead
then
she
has
told
me
just
now
that
she
means
only
to
marry
when
she
can
gain
her
heart
desire
but
what
that
is
god
or
the
devil
alone
knows
lady
garribardine
looked
at
him
shrewdly
for
a
second
she
did
not
speak
so
strobridge
went
on
by
the
way
she
wants
me
to
take
her
and
arabella
to
hear
a
debate
in
the
house
of
lords
may
i
of
course
if
he
had
not
been
so
preoccupied
with
his
own
thoughts
he
would
have
remarked
his
aunt
tone
but
he
was
absently
staring
out
of
the
window
and
did
not
even
see
her
face
with
its
sagacious
querying
expression
she
is
greatly
interested
in
politics
i
believe
she
is
well
up
in
them
already
she
is
well
up
in
everything
i
daresay
she
could
open
a
bazaar
or
give
an
address
better
than
i
could
myself
i
can
spare
her
next
wednesday
afternoon
when
the
debate
on
the
land
bill
will
be
in
full
swing
you
can
arrange
it
i
seraphim
is
it
pitiful
about
poor
l√§o
younger
or
older
it
would
not
have
mattered
quite
so
much
but
at
heavens
the
only
thing
the
poor
darling
had
her
beauty
wo
be
worth
looking
at
in
a
year
or
so
the
mentality
of
women
is
beyond
me
so
utterly
unaccountable
their
actions
are
not
at
all
my
precious
they
are
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
only
any
man
can
be
bamboozled
by
the
silliest
of
them
they
all
answer
to
type
and
sex
l√§o
has
the
brains
of
her
type
the
female
guinea
pig
raised
under
artificial
conditions
which
have
altered
but
not
stifled
the
guinea
pig
strongest
instinct
prolific
reproduction
it
came
out
in
l√§o
not
in
the
desire
to
have
a
numerous
family
but
in
an
intense
desire
to
attract
the
male
pour
le
bon
motif
bien
entendu
but
for

not

they

yes
a

the

she
i
have
always
found
my
greatest
success
with
her
lay
in

distortion
of
every
fact
to
suit
her
personal
view
katherine

and
yourself
sweet
aunt
are
the
only
two
of
your
sex
that
i
have
ever
met
whom
a
man
need
not
humour
and
can
speak
his
real
mind
out
to
and
with
this
he
kissed
her
fat
hand
and
took
his
way
from
her
presence
down
the
gallery
to
his
room
to
dress
for
dinner
but
all
the
while
stirling
was
coaxing
the
real
silver
and
auxiliary
iron
grey
waves
into
a
superbly
simple
triumph
of
hairdressing
her
ladyship
wore
a
slight
frown
of
concentrated
thought
what
did
it
mean
this
desire
on
the
part
of
her
secretary
to
see
the
house
of
lords
vermondsay
hankhurst
upper
harringway
she
counted
over
a
long
list
of
the
names
of
peers
who
frequented
blissington
and
berkeley
square
but
at
the
end
she
shook
her
head
no
none
of
these
who
then
and
what
for
katherine
bush
was
no
guinea
pig
answering
to
type
what
type
was
she
by
the
way
a
complicated
conglomerated
mixture
not
easy
to
dissect
at
any
time
was
this
new
move
a
manifestation
of
sex
or
type
time
alone
would
show
until
then
the
solution
must
remain
in
the
lap
of
the
gods

dinner
should
not
wait

chapter
xxii
the
outside
of
the
houses
of
parliament
had
always
affected
katherine
they
looked
stately
and
english
and
when
they
herself
and
old
arabella
and
gerard
walked
through
the
corridors
of
the
house
of
lords
and
came
at
last
to
the
huge
vaulted
chamber
itself
and
so
to
the
pen
where
they
might
stand
to
hear
the
debate
her
heart
began
to
beat
with
some
strange
excitement
they
went
into
the
left
side
enclosure
and
so
could
have
a
facing
view
of
the
opposition
benches
some
member
of
the
government
had
just
begun
a
speech
as
they
entered
and
katherine
had
time
to
look
about
her
what
types
to
study
and
what
an
atmosphere
of
calm
after
the
scene
in
the
house
of
commons
she
had
witnessed
on
her
visit
there
a
din
of
angry
voices
and
uncontrolled
emotion
here
if
people
felt
anything
it
did
not
appear
on
the
surface
katherine
leaned
upon
the
second
carved
griffin
which
helps
to
adorn
the
partition
which
separates
the
pen
from
the
sacred
floor
of
the
house
itself
from
there
her
eyes
travelled
from
face
to
face
opposite
her
she
recognised
several
indeed
many
whom
she
had
seen
either
in
london
or
at
blissington
but
who
were
those
others
some
with
features
far
from
aristocratic
she
now
examined
the
ministerial
benches
and
made
many
reflections
while
she
only
half
listened
to
the
rather
lame
string
of
sentences
which
were
falling
from
a
very
carefully
preserved
gentleman
who
seemed
little
interested
in
his
subject
and
almost
ashamed
to
be
speaking
from
that
side
of
the
house
then
from
the
end
by
the
throne
two
newcomers
entered
and
took
their
seats
one
on
the
front
opposition
bench
for
the
moment
katherine
eye
had
followed
the
younger
of
the
two
who
went
towards
the
back
so
that
she
did
not
become
conscious
of
the
personality
of
the
other
until
at
the
conclusion
of
the
speech
he
rose
and
laid
some
papers
down
upon
the
table
in
front
of
him
amidst
a
sudden
thrill
of
interest
which
noticeably
ran
through
the
assembly
he
was
a
very
tall
and
person
rather
thin
and
upright
and
in
everything
about
him
there
was
a
strange
suggestion
which
characterised
even
the
cutting
and
brushing
of
his
hair
and
the
shape
of
his
coat
the
brow
was
lofty
and
broad
and
the
thin
locks
were
combed
straight
back
from
it
and
seemed
to
be
perhaps
rather
longer
than
those
of
the
young
men
he
had
very
large
eyes
deeply
set
probably
dark
blue
katherine
thought
and
his
nose
was
prominently
aquiline
he
was
all
but
a
small
pair
of
whiskers
and
this
with
some
peculiarity
about
the
shirt
and
the
frockcoat
he
wore
as
well
as
a
black
satin
stock
stamped
him
as
someone
of
an
altogether
different
generation
century
katherine
had
almost
said
to
herself
who
could
he
be
there
was
some
picture
she
had
seen
which
he
reminded
her
of
she
thought
for
a
minute
yes
it
was
a
certain
print
which
hung
in
a
passage
at
blissington
of
the
duke
of
wellington
in
evening
dress
a
profile
with
the
ribbon
of
the
garter
across
his
breast
this
man
had
something
of
the
same
personality
his
whole
appearance
was
so
unusual
so
almost
startling
that
had
anyone
else
attempted
to
achieve
the
same
result
he
would
have
looked
either
vulgarly
dramatic
or
quite
grotesque
but
with
this
man
even
the
clothes
with
their
suspicion
of
a
dandyism
seemed
to
add
to
his
immense
distinction
katherine
thought
that
if
she
could
have
drawn
a
picture
of
a
typical
aristocrat
of
the
tory
persuasion
of
perhaps
a
hundred
years
ago
this
man
would
have
made
a
perfect
model
and
now
he
began
to
speak
and
of
all
the
voices
she
had
ever
heard
or
admired
from
beyond
the
glass
screen
at
liv
and
dev
or
listened
to
in
her
present
situation
none
had
ever
struck
her
as
so
ultra
refined
as
the
perfectly
modulated
tones
now
vibrating
through
the
house
his
words
were
selected
with
judgment
and
grace
and
showed
the
command
of
an
uncommon
vocabulary
she
had
thought
gerard
strobridge
sentences
were
and
cultivated
but
they
would
sound
quite
modern
and
almost
colloquial
she
felt
compared
with
the
flow
of
language
which
poured
forth
from
this
mouth
the
whole
mien
of
the
man
expressed
intense
pride
and
dignity
and
a
perfect
he
gesticulated
very
little
and
kept
one
hand
with
the
thumb
resting
above
a
button
of
his
fastened
coat
so
that
she
could
see
his
hand
plainly
and
its
shape
which
was
in
keeping
with
the
rest
of
his
appearance
and
on
his
little
finger
was
a
great
graven
emerald
or
some
green
stone
in
a
ring
which
caught
a
ray
of
light
and
sparkled
for
a
second
how
was
it
that
so
noticeable
a
personage
had
never
been
to
berkeley
square
or
blissington
he
was
of
her
ladyship
political
convictions
too
and
must
be
of
importance
to
occupy
so
prominent
a
place
and
presently
she
began
to
take
in
the
words
he
was
saying
and
gathered
from
a
sentence
which
remarked
upon
his
long
absence
from
your
ladyship
house
that
he
must
have
been
for
some
time
out
of
england
then
she
grew
fascinated
with
the
speech
itself
it
was
so
witty
and
filled
with
an
exquisite
sarcasm
such
must
have
been
the
speeches
of
chesterfield
she
thought
in
this
same
house
of
lords
more
than
a
century
and
a
half
ago
how
old
could
he
be
fifty
forty
it
was
impossible
to
say
suddenly
she
was
conscious
of
a
deep
enthralled
interest
affecting
her
and
she
turned
and
whispered
to
strobridge
at
her
side
who
is
that
man
speaking
now
i
would
so
much
like
to
know
the
duke
of
mordryn
is
he
not
a
type
the
last
real
tory
left
in
this
age
and
then
katherine
remembered
that
letters
addressed
to
this
name
and
written
in
lady
garribardine
own
hand
had
often
gone
with
the
rest
to
be
posted
always
to
addresses
abroad
ever
since
she
had
been
in
her
service
and
often
too
she
recalled
the
duke
had
been
spoken
of
as
being
here
or
there
and
gradually
on
his
way
home
but
nothing
about
him
had
particularly
interested
or
struck
her
except
the
name
mordryn
it
was
a
perfect
name
she
began
piecing
together
what
she
knew
about
him
at
liv
and
dev
she
had
been
obliged
to
know
a
good
deal
about
all
dukes
their
son
courtesy
titles
and
family
names
this
string
came
back
to
her
mechanically
duke
of
mordryn
marquis
of
valfreyne
earl
of
rievaulx
and
a
number
of
baronies
while
the
family
appellation
was
monluce
and
the
chief
place
of
several
residences
valfreyne
in
dorsetshire
she
remembered
too
that
the
duchess
had
died
less
than
two
years
ago
after
this
her
absorbed
interest
concentrated
upon
the
man
himself
and
she
almost
felt
a
little
breathless
when
he
sat
down
and
a
moment
or
two
after
when
he
seemed
to
have
leisure
to
look
about
him
she
met
his
eyes
and
she
could
see
that
they
were
indeed
a
very
dark
blue
and
that
his
gaze
consciously
rested
upon
her
she
did
not
turn
hers
away
she
was
fascinated
and
slowly
there
came
a
thought
to
her
this
is
what
fate
means
for
me
and
for
a
few
seconds
she
felt
faint
and
icy
cold
so
great
was
her
emotion
the
unknown
goal
of
all
her
striving
was
revealed
at
last
the
position
of
this
man
wife
would
be
the
greatest
to
be
achieved
in
england
for
prestige
and
influence
it
should
be
she
heard
and
saw
and
knew
nothing
which
happened
after
this
only
what
was
spoken
and
done
by
the
duke
and
presently
miss
arabella
growing
tired
they
went
out
their
exit
accelerated
by
katherine
who
saw
that
his
grace
had
risen
and
was
coming
their
way
they
stopped
for
a
second
just
at
the
place
where
the
hats
are
left
and
he
caught
them
up
and
shook
hands
with
strobridge
and
miss
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
gerard
he
said
it
is
good
to
be
at
home
again
and
then
he
gave
some
gallant
greeting
to
miss
and
paused
absently
looking
at
katherine
who
stood
by
demurely
presenting
an
attractive
picture
in
her
grey
suit
and
hat
all
care
was
now
taken
of
her
ample
tresses
which
were
arranged
to
show
the
smallness
of
her
head
and
every
article
of
her
garments
was
chosen
to
express
unobtrusive
distinction
for
many
months
her
astute
intelligence
had
been
turned
upon
the
enhancing
of
her
attractions
with
wonderful
result
miss
bush
the
duke
of
mordryn
strobridge
was
obliged
to
murmur
and
katherine
bowed
and
waited
to
see
if
the
duke
would
speak
he
did
with
that
aloof
but
gracious
courtesy
which
he
showed
to
all
women
you
have
come
to
hear
our
highly
futile
debate
in
this
mutilated
chamber
i
hope
you
were
not
too
bored
i
was
very
much
interested
and
she
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
in
the
way
she
did
when
she
intended
to
compel
attention
as
gerard
strobridge
watched
her
he
suddenly
felt
a
twinge
of
fear
he
refused
to
acknowledge
the
thought
which
presented
itself
but
indicated
that
they
should
go
on
the
duke
meanwhile
had
not
been
unaffected
by
katherine
magnetic
eyes
he
felt
a
spark
of
interest
and
so
continued
the
conversation
for
a
minute
but
finally
had
to
give
way
to
gerard
evident
desire
to
move
forward
tell
her
ladyship
that
i
am
coming
to
lunch
i
only
crossed
last
night
and
have
had
no
time
to
answer
her
note
awaiting
me
i
hope
she
is
well
and
has
not
allowed
this
modern
rush
and
turmoil
to
spoil
her
enchanting
wit
when
they
got
out
into
the
open
air
katherine
noticed
that
strobridge
had
a
fierce
and
rather
hunted
expression
on
his
face
he
got
into
the
taxi
after
the
two
ladies
without
a
word
and
said
very
little
as
they
drove
to
miss
tiny
flat
in
knightsbridge
perhaps
as
it
is
so
fine
you
will
let
me
dismiss
the
cab
and
we
might
walk
across
the
park
he
suggested
as
he
rejoined
katherine
after
seeing
miss
arabella
in
at
the
door
and
she
consented
the
air
was
crisp
and
fresh
and
the
dusk
was
gathering
it
was
a
quarter
to
six
they
turned
towards
stanhope
gate
and
walked
in
silence
then
strobridge
stopped
suddenly
and
drew
katherine
to
a
chair
katherine
he
said
and
his
voice
was
husky
is
it
so
is
what
so
she
questioned
to
be
quite
certain
what
he
meant
is
the
duke
to
be
your
objective
she
did
not
answer
she
was
weighing
things
gerard
assistance
would
be
necessary
for
the
pursuance
of
a
plan
which
had
been
forming
in
her
head
since
she
had
left
the
houses
of
parliament
she
was
swift
to
decide
and
swift
to
act
at
critical
moments
in
her
life
do
you
think
you
have
any
right
to
ask
me
such
a
question
yes
what
right
i
love
you
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
no
i
will
never
admit
it
it
is
true
enough
oh
katherine
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
do
for
you
and
you
know
it
only
i
can
not
help
wanting
to
be
certain
if
i
am
to
expect
the
worst
i
feared
it
at
once
when
you
looked
into
his
eyes
has
my
doom
come
at
last
then
you
are
paying
me
a
great
compliment
you
seem
to
think
that
the
matter
lies
only
in
my
hands
you
will
accomplish
anything
you
desire
she
did
not
speak
katherine
he
pleaded
and
there
was
anguish
in
his
voice
tell
me
the
truth
whether
i
have
the
right
to
ask
it
or
no
the
idea
has
come
to
you
that
this
would
be
worth
winning
this
position
has
it
not
yes
he
is
years
old
mordryn
but
a
which
women
adore
you
would
probably
fall
in
love
with
him
also
it
is
possible
can
you
expect
me
to
be
anything
but
pained
then
i
have
always
told
you
that
i
consider
you
only
as
a
friend
and
that
i
only
view
your
emotions
for
me
as
those
of
friendship
therefore
there
should
be
no
pain
even
in
such
an
idea
according
to
my
view
there
is
i
am
sorry
but
it
does
not
change
your
determination
no
i
understand
a
man
killing
a
woman
sometimes
and
he
clenched
his
hands
passionately
so
do
i
when
she
deceives
him
never
because
she
is
honest
and
unvarying
i
have
never
deceived
you
or
led
you
to
hope
for
anything
but
friendship
that
you
have
in
full
and
you
have
hundreds
of
times
promised
me
yours
if
you
meant
it
i
now
ask
you
to
give
me
a
proof
of
it
what
proof
i
wish
to
meet
the
duke
not
as
lady
garribardine
secretary
that
would
prejudice
him
too
much
naturally
i
want
to
meet
him
in
the
evening
at
dinner
as
a
guest
i
want
to
talk
to
him
and
see
for
myself
what
he
is
like
and
if
he
is
as
wonderful
as
he
looks
only
you
could
arrange
this
if
you
asked
him
to
dinner
and
asked
me
and
miss
arabella
or
miss
gwendoline
it
would
be
possible
would
it
not
he
was
staring
at
her
now
overcome
by
her
masterly
frankness
no
she
would
never
deceive
him
he
realised
that
and
also
that
nothing
of
his
will
could
ever
impose
upon
hers
he
knew
he
was
impotent
as
a
factor
in
the
determining
of
her
plans
all
he
could
do
to
keep
her
favour
was
to
fall
in
with
them
her
face
white
as
a
lily
in
the
growing
dusk
was
calm
and
cold
and
beautiful
he
had
never
desired
her
more
but
that
fastidiousness
in
him
that
power
of
detachment
which
could
appreciate
skill
even
when
exercised
against
his
own
interests
asserted
itself
and
helped
him
she
was
so
wonderful
a
character
he
must
assist
her
even
to
his
own
pain
i
suppose
it
would
be
possible
beatrice
goes
down
to
allerton
until
after
easter
i
expect
i
could
arrange
it
for
friday
night
if
i
can
only
get
the
duke
he
will
be
awfully
busy
these
days
but
perhaps
if
i
ask
him
at
once
i
might
catch
him
then
he
thought
a
moment
yes
i
got
a
new
case
of
miniatures
i
bought
last
week
at
an
odd
sale
i
could
beguile
him
on
the
pretext
of
giving
me
his
opinion
as
to
whether
or
no
two
of
them
are
really
cosways
you
see
to
what
a
state
of
abject
slavery
you
have
reduced
me
no
i
have
not
you
are
being
merely
a
loyal
friend
at
dinner
i
will
ask
my
aunt
if
you
may
dine
i
have
some
boring
country
friends
coming
in
any
case
that
night
and
she
will
let
me
have
you
to
help
to
entertain
them
i
expect
you
are
supposed
to
be
extraordinarily
talented
as
an
entertainer
of
bores
he
could
not
keep
some
of
the
bitterness
he
was
feeling
out
of
his
voice
katherine
looked
at
him
reproachfully
i
thought
you
would
perhaps
have
understood
and
been
kind
he
responded
at
once
to
her
tone
darling
i
will
you
know
it
i
will
show
you
that
i
am
indeed
your
devoted
friend
will
that
please
you
she
inwardly
appreciated
his
sacrifice
and
her
eyes
shone
softly
upon
him
his
face
was
haggard
and
looked
hungry
its
expression
would
have
surprised
the
many
women
who
had
loved
him
and
on
whom
he
had
turned
a
transient
smile
yes
that
will
please
me
and
her
voice
was
sweet
now
tell
me
about
him
i
remember
to
have
read
in
the
papers
some
time
ago
that
the
duchess
had
died
he
has
had
an
awful
life
the
duchess
was
mad
she
was
a
thorval
a
cousin
of
my
wife
and
went
more
or
less
off
her
head
soon
after
they
were
married
about
years
ago
then
for
more
than
fifteen
years
she
was
extremely
peculiar
but
not
quite
bad
enough
to
be
entirely
shut
up
only
of
course
it
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
have
friends
or
to
entertain
and
enjoy
his
great
position
then
she
became
quite
mad
and
had
to
be
isolated
and
by
this
time
adeliza
the
only
child
began
to
show
signs
of
derangement
too
and
so
he
had
the
horror
of
seeing
the
same
thing
occurring
over
again
about
two
years
ago
the
duchess
died
and
fortunately
soon
after
adeliza
caught
scarlet
fever
and
died
also
just
before
you
came
to
my
aunt
and
then
mordryn
started
on
a
long
voyage
round
the
world
to
try
and
make
a
break
and
forget
and
he
has
been
abroad
ever
since
and
only
returned
last
night
poor
man
then
he
did
not
obtain
much
pleasure
from
his
great
position
not
in
england
but
one
must
suppose
that
he
has
had
some
kind
of
consolations
in
all
these
years
he
was
often
in
paris
and
has
always
been
extremely
attractive
but
he
is
a
great
gentleman
and
there
have
never
been
any
scandals
about
him
and
now
all
those
ugly
shadows
have
been
removed
from
his
life
and
he
is
free
katherine
drew
in
her
breath
a
little
yes
he
is
free
gerard
concurred
gloomily
he
is
a
most
intimate
friend
of
my
aunt
you
will
see
him
constantly
at
blissington
where
i
am
the
secretary
yes
ah
if
you
knew
how
i
long
sometimes
to
be
myself
and
not
to
have
to
act
meekness
ah
you
would
know
then
how
grateful
i
shall
be
if
you
can
give
me
this
one
evening
of
happiness
he
was
touched
she
so
seldom
showed
any
emotion
he
felt
rewarded
for
some
of
his
sufferings
you
shall
have
as
perfect
a
time
as
i
can
secure
for
you
katherine
dear
girl
and
he
bent
forward
and
took
her
hand
you
would
adorn
any
position
in
the
world
but
if
mordryn
were
not
a
most
splendid
character
i
would
not
help
you
to
meet
him
he
is
one
of
the
finest
in
the
world
and
i
will
try
i
promise
you
i
will
try
not
to
let
any
jealous
envy
stand
in
your
way
you
are
a
dear
after
all
and
she
returned
the
pressure
of
his
fingers
before
she
drew
hers
away
there
was
a
strange
light
in
her
eyes
as
she
walked
up
the
stairs
to
her
room
in
berkeley
square
a
wonderful
vista
had
suddenly
opened
itself
before
her
with
a
mountain
in
the
distance
all
of
shining
gold
it
seemed
that
it
must
always
have
been
there
but
that
some
mist
had
hidden
it
which
was
now
rolled
away
what
if
she
should
be
able
to
reach
this
splendid
gilded
mountain
top
some
day
a
glorious
end
to
aim
at
in
any
case
and
she
shut
her
white
teeth
firmly
and
sitting
down
by
her
open
window
began
steadily
to
think
that
night
fate
held
a
surprise
in
store
for
her
she
was
going
to
the
theatre
with
matilda
a
periodical
treat
which
that
sister
greatly
enjoyed
they
went
in
the
dress
circle
and
saw
the
show
two
unobserved
units
in
the
crowd
as
it
was
for
matilda
pleasure
she
was
left
to
choose
what
she
would
see
it
was
always
either
a
lyceum
melodrama
or
a
musical
comedy
and
this
night
it
chanced
to
be
the
latter
and
one
newly
put
on
so
the
audience
was
less
remarkably
homely
than
usual
who
and
what
were
the
audiences
at
theatres
this
katherine
often
asked
herself
and
while
matilda
enjoyed
what
was
happening
on
the
stage
she
studied
the
types
around
her
who
invented
such
hairdressing
who
designed
such
clothes
whence
came
they
and
whither
did
they
go
this
particular
night
katherine
and
matilda
were
rather
at
the
side
of
the
dress
circle
a
row
or
two
back
so
that
they
could
see
a
good
deal
of
the
stalls
and
towards
the
end
of
the
first
act
katherine
languid
attention
suddenly
became
riveted
upon
two
particularly
well
brushed
male
heads
in
the
front
row
their
owners
must
have
come
in
while
she
had
been
looking
at
the
stage
there
was
something
quite
uniquely
spruce
about
young
englishmen
heads
she
knew
and
they
were
all
very
much
alike
of
a
certain
class
but
the
fairer
of
these
two
was
painfully
familiar
it
belonged
to
lord
algy
and
to
no
one
else
he
had
returned
from
egypt
then
he
was
there
within
a
few
yards
of
her
oh
why
was
it
such
pain
to
see
him
again
her
heart
beat
to
suffocation
she
felt
every
pulse
in
her
body
tingle
with
excitement
and
then
she
felt
a
little
sick
and
for
a
few
minutes
she
could
not
have
risen
from
her
seat
matilda
turned
for
a
moment
and
exclaimed
oh
my
goodness
gracious
kitten
whatever
is
the
matter
dear
then
katherine
recollected
herself
and
answered
a
little
shakily
i
do
know
the
heat
i
suppose
i
am
all
right
now
though
and
this
a
funny
scene
do
let
us
talk
and
spoil
it
and
matilda
reassured
gladly
again
turned
to
the
stage
so
katherine
sat
on
fighting
her
battle
alone
she
forced
herself
to
look
at
her
whilom
lover
with
calm
and
watch
every
movement
of
his
attractive
head
he
appeared
well
and
bronzed
and
handsomer
than
ever
she
could
see
as
he
turned
to
speak
to
his
companion
and
she
almost
fancied
she
could
hear
the
tones
of
his
voice
then
she
made
herself
analyse
things
did
she
really
love
him
still
then
gradually
she
became
more
controlled
as
she
realised
that
if
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
upon
him
like
this
the
magnetic
power
of
her
gaze
would
certainly
cause
him
to
look
round
presently
and
see
her
and
that
above
everything
she
did
not
want
this
to
occur
so
she
turned
her
attention
to
the
stage
and
forced
herself
to
listen
to
what
was
being
sung
the
act
was
soon
over
and
then
she
saw
lord
algy
perfect
figure
rise
to
go
out
that
was
jack
kilcourcy
she
thought
probably
with
him
about
whom
she
had
so
often
heard
and
perhaps
they
had
come
to
see
some
special
beauty
in
the
chorus
and
would
go
on
to
supper
later
at
the
savoy
or
elsewhere
oh
no
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
feel
any
more
she
had
surely
passed
beyond
such
things
the
second
act
came
and
went
and
the
third
and
when
it
was
over
she
hurried
matilda
out
in
a
desire
to
escape
before
the
stall
crowd
could
mingle
with
theirs
in
the
doorway
it
was
raining
a
little
when
they
came
to
the
door
and
there
stood
lord
algy
talking
with
his
caressing
devoted
air
to
a
lovely
woman
in
black
whom
katherine
had
noticed
in
one
of
the
boxes
he
did
not
see
her
as
clutching
matilda
arm
she
shrank
away
among
the
bedraggled
people
beyond
the
lights
and
there
she
paused
and
turned
for
a
last
look
at
him
and
saw
him
follow
the
lady
into
a
smart
car
the
door
of
which
was
being
held
open
by
a
motor
groom
it
had
just
driven
up
we
will
have
a
taxi
tild
she
said
let
us
walk
on
and
find
one
i
ca
stand
an
omnibus
she
drove
matilda
to
victoria
first
and
then
went
back
to
berkeley
square
a
rather
damp
creature
in
body
and
soul
and
when
she
was
in
bed
the
tears
would
trickle
down
her
cheeks
it
was
all
hateful
the
dress
circle
the
rain
the
cab
the
dependence
and
last
of
all
lord
algy
and
the
lovely
woman
in
black
then
her
sense
of
the
value
of
things
came
back
again
her
indomitable
spirit
revived
and
before
she
fell
asleep
she
knew
that
once
for
all
she
had
banished
any
lingering
regrets
and
that
she
would
play
for
the
great
stakes
in
the
game
of
her
ambition
with
a
zest
as
strong
as
the
desire
for
love
that
love
which
she
now
realized
had
been
mainly
an
affair
of
the
senses
and
which
was
over
and
dead
chapter
xxiii
that
night
after
dinner
when
the
guests
had
left
the
house
in
berkeley
square
strobridge
asked
his
aunt
if
she
would
lend
him
miss
bush
for
friday
night
to
help
him
to
entertain
some
bores
beatrice
would
be
away
and
he
really
felt
he
could
not
face
them
alone
gwendoline
or
arabella
would
come
too
katherine
had
dined
at
the
strobridges
house
in
brook
street
once
or
twice
before
for
similar
reasons
and
the
request
therefore
did
not
seem
unusual
but
gerard
knew
his
seraphim
too
well
not
to
be
aware
that
when
she
heard
that
mordryn
had
dined
also
she
might
suspect
some
plot
and
would
then
very
possibly
be
mildly
annoyed
with
him
and
really
angry
with
katherine
every
scrap
of
his
diplomatic
gift
would
have
to
be
employed
over
this
he
was
going
to
be
at
the
luncheon
next
day
which
the
duke
had
announced
his
intention
of
attending
he
must
so
manage
the
conversation
that
miniatures
were
discussed
and
then
in
aunt
hearing
mordryn
could
be
asked
to
come
and
inspect
them
as
a
mere
afterthought
if
this
failed
to
allay
all
suspicion
of
underlying
intention
in
the
affair
he
would
have
boldly
to
tell
his
aunt
the
truth
only
taking
the
whole
credit
or
blame
of
the
idea
upon
his
own
shoulders
no
reflection
must
fall
upon
katherine
her
ladyship
announced
casually
that
yes
he
might
take
the
secretary
and
welcome
if
he
returned
her
not
too
late
at
night
she
had
to
be
up
early
in
the
morning
as
she
was
starting
on
a
holiday
of
a
few
duration
the
dutiful
nephew
thanked
his
aunt
and
requested
her
to
let
miss
bush
know
that
she
would
be
wanted
on
friday
if
she
would
be
kind
enough
to
come
but
lady
garribardine
was
preoccupied
with
a
subject
much
nearer
her
heart
and
turned
to
it
at
once
i
am
dying
to
see
mordryn
i
wish
i
had
known
he
was
going
to
speak
and
i
would
have
gone
to
the
house
he
felt
it
his
duty
i
suppose
this
wretched
land
bill
how
did
he
look
and
did
you
get
a
word
with
him
i
shall
see
him
of
course
strobridge
gave
the
message
that
he
had
been
asked
to
give
and
vouchsafed
the
information
that
the
duke
had
appeared
as
usual
and
was
altogether
charming
as
ever
it
is
to
be
hoped
he
will
get
some
good
out
of
life
now
that
he
is
free
at
last
from
those
mad
women
her
ladyship
face
assumed
a
strange
expression
she
sat
down
in
her
usual
armchair
with
an
air
of
fatigue
your
words
strike
home
for
you
know
i
made
his
marriage
in
those
far
back
ignorant
days
when
no
one
thought
of
heredity
or
such
things
i
literally
married
him
off
to
laura
almost
against
his
will
because
he
was
utterly
devoted
to
me
and
i
to
him
and
the
situation
was
becoming
impossible
over
ten
years
between
our
ages
his
immense
position
and
mine
and
garribardine
jealous
there
was
nothing
else
for
it
laura
was
a
sweet
foolish
creature
then
beautiful
and
of
no
account
i
felt
she
would
never
replace
me
in
his
affection
and
in
those
days
nearly
thirty
years
ago
it
would
have
been
considered
almost
indecent
to
talk
of
what
future
children
might
turn
out
they
were
supposed
to
come
from
the
cabbage
beds
and
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
their
parents
of
course
one
had
always
heard
he
was
devoted
to
you
seraphim
he
is
still
dear
mordryn
laura
gave
him
trouble
on
the
honeymoon
and
once
made
him
look
ridiculous
he
never
pardoned
that
by
the
time
she
was
shut
up
i
was
fifty
and
had
mercifully
a
strong
sense
of
humour
so
mordryn
and
i
had
no
lapses
and
have
remained
firm
friends
as
you
know
one
has
often
wondered
what
his
inner
life
could
have
been
during
all
those
years
of
horror
at
home
he
was
a
model
of
circumspection
outwardly
but
the
adoration
of
women
must
have
affected
him
now
and
then
not
greatly
i
think
naturally
he
has
had
some
consolation
but
when
one
thinks
of
it
it
is
perfectly
marvellous
that
no
woman
in
england
has
ever
been
able
to
flatter
herself
that
she
possessed
an
influence
over
him
and
of
course
in
these
last
years
he
has
not
even
seen
any
i
suppose
he
will
marry
again
now
having
no
heir
there
was
a
very
interested
note
in
strobridge
voice
he
must
and
he
must
find
a
sane
and
strong
woman
the
family
is
on
the
verge
of
being
overbred
i
must
look
out
a
suitable
bunch
for
him
to
select
from
i
should
leave
it
to
fate
this
time
seraphim
if
i
do
that
some
totally
unsuitable
creature
with
a
clever
mother
will
grab
him
strobridge
laughed
has
not
the
man
a
will
of
his
own
no
man
has
a
will
of
his
own
while
the
vanity
of
his
sex
is
still
in
him
he
is
as
defenceless
as
a
baby
and
at
the
mercy
of
any
cunning
female
i
could
not
bear
to
see
mordryn
suffering
a
second
time
and
lady
garribardine
sighed
after
luncheon
next
day
when
the
rest
of
the
company
had
departed
the
duke
stayed
on
and
accompanied
his
friend
up
to
her
own
where
they
could
talk
undisturbed
they
understood
each
other
completely
they
spoke
for
a
long
time
of
his
travels
and
of
his
release
at
last
from
bondage
and
strain
and
of
how
he
was
going
to
open
valfreyne
once
more
and
see
the
world
of
his
fellows
and
take
up
the
thread
of
his
life
you
must
not
keep
a
grain
of
mawkish
sentiment
mordryn
her
ladyship
said
at
last
you
must
banish
all
remembrance
of
laura
and
adeliza
and
begin
life
afresh
at
it
is
a
little
late
i
fear
for
the
game
to
have
much
zest
tut
tut
you
have
never
found
the
youngest
and
most
beautiful
woman
recalcitrant
i
wager
one
had
heard
not
so
many
years
ago
that
a
certain
fine
creature
in
paris
almost
died
of
love
for
you
the
duke
smiled
and
when
he
did
this
it
was
an
illumination
his
face
in
repose
was
so
stern
not
of
love
of
chagrin
because
the
ruby
in
the
bangle
she
received
was
reported
to
her
by
her
masseuse
to
be
of
less
pure
pigeon
blood
than
the
duplicate
which
i
gave
to
the
spaniard
it
is
impossible
to
gauge
the
love
of
a
mistress
it
is
equally
kindled
by
rubies
and
the
charms
of
a
youthful
apollo
but
you
need
not
now
confine
your
attentions
to
any
longer
mordryn
there
are
numbers
of
our
world
who
would
console
you
the
duke
smiled
again
none
of
them
ever
mattered
to
me
very
much
as
you
know
dear
friend
from
the
days
when
my
whole
soul
was
yours
since
then
women
have
been
rare
relaxations
ephemeral
diversions
leaving
no
mark
we
are
going
to
change
all
that
then
their
talk
drifted
to
other
things
and
before
his
grace
left
he
had
promised
to
spend
easter
at
blissington
while
luncheon
had
yet
been
in
full
swing
and
a
propitious
moment
had
come
gerard
had
carried
out
his
plan
the
subject
of
miniatures
was
introduced
and
a
heated
argument
ensued
about
the
likelihood
of
the
new
acquisitions
being
by
cosway
and
then
the
suggestion
that
the
duke
should
come
in
and
dine
the
next
night
and
decide
the
matter
came
out
quite
naturally
lady
garribardine
made
no
remark
at
the
time
and
indeed
hardly
thought
about
it
but
that
night
when
she
sat
by
her
bedroom
fire
she
suddenly
remembered
that
her
secretary
would
meet
the
duke
and
for
a
long
time
she
stared
into
the
glowing
embers
in
deep
thought
no
it
was
not
possible
that
the
girl
had
known
that
he
would
speak
that
was
not
her
reason
for
wishing
to
go
to
the
house
of
lords
but
she
had
seen
him
there
and
now
she
would
meet
him
at
dinner
a
number
of
expressions
chased
themselves
over
her
countenance
while
her
eyes
never
left
the
one
point
in
the
coals
the
frown
of
cogitation
deepened
on
her
forehead
and
then
cleared
away
she
had
come
to
a
decision
when
mordryn
had
retired
with
his
hostess
after
luncheon
gerard
strobridge
had
sought
miss
bush
in
the
secretary
room
the
deed
is
done
katherine
he
announced
with
an
attempt
at
gaiety
while
his
heart
was
heavy
within
him
the
duke
is
coming
to
dinner
on
friday
night
and
gwendoline
not
arabella
and
a
couple
of
bores
from
the
country
so
all
my
duties
and
sacrifices
are
completed
now
are
you
going
to
give
me
a
reward
it
depends
upon
its
nature
yes
i
know
that
it
is
quite
a
reasonable
one
it
is
to
come
down
in
my
motor
with
me
this
afternoon
and
see
the
spring
borders
at
hampton
court
katherine
hesitated
she
would
love
to
go
but
she
had
work
to
do
before
and
unless
she
sat
up
late
at
night
it
could
not
be
accomplished
he
came
over
and
spoke
earnestly
i
feel
that
this
will
be
the
last
time
that
we
can
be
pupil
and
teacher
katherine
fate
is
going
to
change
for
us
both
i
want
to
keep
a
memory
of
you
dearest
when
you
were
my
friend
alone
without
the
shadow
of
any
other
interest
between
wo
you
try
to
give
me
this
one
last
great
pleasure
katherine
was
touched
yes
i
will
she
agreed
i
can
not
go
up
and
ask
her
ladyship
now
but
i
believe
she
would
let
me
go
i
have
no
business
with
her
until
morning
do
you
want
me
to
come
at
once
yes
i
will
walk
on
round
to
the
garage
and
get
the
motor
and
you
can
meet
me
at
stanhope
gate
it
turned
out
to
be
an
afternoon
which
neither
of
them
would
ever
forget
and
katherine
bush
had
never
been
so
near
to
emotion
for
her
friend
as
when
at
last
they
sat
down
upon
a
bench
and
looked
away
to
the
broad
green
avenue
between
the
giant
trees
gerard
strobridge
had
exerted
every
power
he
possessed
to
please
her
he
had
enchanted
her
fancy
and
had
drawn
out
all
that
was
finest
in
herself
they
had
studied
the
flowers
and
talked
of
their
favourite
books
and
katherine
was
conscious
that
she
herself
was
being
brilliant
and
that
now
his
flights
were
not
beyond
her
but
that
she
could
fully
hold
her
own
if
i
had
been
unwed
katherine
would
you
have
married
me
he
asked
her
at
last
divine
as
has
been
think
what
it
would
have
meant
with
love
between
us
and
further
joys
to
come
katherine
i
would
have
done
my
utmost
to
make
you
happy
will
you
answer
me
this
question
i
think
it
may
be
the
last
one
i
shall
ever
ask
you
she
let
her
hands
fall
into
her
lap
and
she
looked
at
him
critically
for
a
while
before
she
spoke
and
her
voice
was
reflective
when
she
did
reply
i
think
if
you
had
been
free
at
that
first
christmas
yes
i
would
have
married
you
i
would
have
let
you
take
me
away
and
teach
me
all
that
i
now
know
and
then
i
would
have
made
you
use
all
your
gifts
and
rise
rise
to
the
top
of
your
tree
i
would
never
have
rested
until
you
had
reached
the
summit
and
i
with
you
he
gave
a
little
groan
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
i
forged
all
the
barriers
to
joy
by
weakness
long
ago
katherine
i
drifted
idly
down
life
stream
and
now
am
caught
in
the
rushes
and
can
not
get
free
the
thought
is
bitter
sweet
dear
love
this
picture
of
what
might
have
been
and
i
would
have
taught
you
to
love
me
at
last
ah
god
the
pain
but
now
i
do
not
want
to
finish
this
day
with
sorrowful
repinings
i
will
keep
this
memory
of
your
words
and
go
my
way
and
when
you
come
into
your
kingdom
remember
me
and
let
us
renew
our
friendship
on
calmer
shores
he
took
her
hand
and
pulling
her
glove
off
backwards
kissed
each
white
finger
and
then
his
eyes
grew
misty
and
he
said
farewell
and
in
katherine
heart
there
was
a
strange
sadness
and
they
hardly
spoke
at
all
as
they
sped
homewards
chapter
xxiv
when
friday
night
came
and
katherine
was
ready
to
get
into
the
taxi
with
miss
gwendoline
she
felt
exalted
as
she
had
never
done
in
her
life
this
evening
would
be
the
test
of
her
powers
if
she
failed
then
she
would
know
that
such
high
goals
were
not
for
her
and
so
she
must
curtail
her
aspirations
she
would
not
it
might
be
that
the
duke
would
not
be
drawn
to
her
it
was
impossible
to
tell
from
that
one
afternoon
what
his
temperament
could
be
but
at
all
costs
she
must
not
fail
in
being
a
cultivated
lady
a
guest
among
equals
and
so
to
take
at
least
that
place
in
his
regard
there
was
something
almost
diabolically
whimsical
in
the
fact
that
one
passionate
lover
was
deliberately
arranging
that
his
lady
should
meet
a
possible
rival
gerard
strobridge
appreciated
this
point
as
he
stood
before
the
cheerful
wood
fire
in
the
in
brook
street
awaiting
his
guests
the
bores
of
course
came
first
and
then
katherine
and
old
miss
gwendoline
and
last
of
all
not
more
than
five
minutes
late
his
grace
he
was
quite
abnormally
distinguished
looking
in
evening
dress
which
when
dissected
did
not
prove
to
be
remarkably
different
from
that
of
the
others
but
which
yet
possessed
some
subtle
quality
entirely
apart
from
theirs
in
its
bygone
suggestion
his
manners
were
most
courtly
he
recognised
katherine
at
once
and
shook
hands
with
her
and
then
dinner
was
announced
gerard
sent
the
lady
bore
in
with
the
duke
himself
taking
old
gwendoline
and
leaving
katherine
to
the
husband
so
that
katherine
sat
next
his
grace
at
a
little
round
table
she
was
looking
quite
beautiful
in
a
new
black
frock
as
simple
as
the
old
one
and
with
some
of
her
favourite
lilies
of
the
valley
tucked
into
the
belt
mordryn
felt
constrained
to
talk
to
his
partner
until
after
the
fish
the
host
by
a
tactful
interruption
drew
away
her
attention
and
left
him
free
and
then
without
hesitation
he
turned
to
katherine
her
heart
was
beating
fast
and
the
excitement
made
her
eyes
dark
and
her
cheeks
pale
but
she
did
not
lose
her
head
and
indeed
felt
an
extra
stimulant
to
her
brain
power
he
began
about
the
debate
on
wednesday
the
whole
thing
was
rather
a
mockery
since
they
were
robbed
of
all
power
now
in
the
house
of
lords
and
could
only
make
mild
protests
but
not
enforce
their
opinions
was
miss
bush
interested
in
politics
katherine
said
that
she
was
but
thought
it
rather
a
degrading
profession
now
with
paid
members
making
their
living
out
of
their
seats
and
so
they
spoke
for
a
little
upon
this
theme
and
the
duke
found
himself
agreeably
entertained
he
liked
her
deep
voice
and
above
all
her
extraordinarily
good
hands
bush
he
said
to
himself
i
do
not
remember
to
have
heard
the
name
before
the
mother
perhaps
had
the
breeding
those
hands
do
not
come
from
the
shrubbery
or
the
common
now
katherine
began
to
talk
of
travels
she
knew
that
all
people
enjoyed
discussing
theirs
on
their
return
she
would
much
like
to
visit
the
east
she
had
always
been
thrilled
with
kinglake
description
of
damascus
in
eothen
was
it
really
a
city
of
hidden
palaces
of
copses
and
gardens
and
fountains
and
bubbling
streams
his
grace
eyes
expressed
real
interest
now
not
so
much
that
they
should
discuss
damascus
but
that
a
modern
girl
should
have
read
kinglake
and
deeply
enough
to
quote
him
correctly
he
also
knew
his
kinglake
and
had
that
potent
gift
of
memory
which
never
stumbles
in
its
manifestations
he
continued
the
subject
with
enthusiasm
and
found
that
this
charming
young
woman
was
familiar
with
all
the
subtlest
shades
they
had
touched
upon
passages
of
peculiar
beauty
concerning
the
dead
sea
and
the
girls
of
bethlehem
and
the
wonderful
desert
sun
and
were
in
the
middle
of
those
dedicated
to
the
sphinx
when
the
duke
became
aware
that
a
sweet
was
being
handed
and
that
dinner
was
more
than
half
over
with
infinite
discretion
the
host
had
never
allowed
the
flow
of
conversation
to
flag
so
that
no
pause
among
so
small
a
company
should
bring
this
promising
to
a
close
katherine
should
have
a
fair
field
if
he
could
procure
it
for
her
but
his
grace
good
manners
reproached
him
for
his
negligence
to
the
lady
he
had
taken
in
and
he
turned
from
the
contemplation
of
katherine
regular
profile
with
reluctant
dutifulness
inwardly
determining
to
continue
kinglake
and
other
things
when
they
should
all
be
safely
in
the
these
people
would
surely
play
bridge
what
a
capital
thing
cards
were
if
one
had
strength
of
mind
enough
to
enforce
one
own
selfishness
in
not
playing
them
katherine
now
used
her
best
endeavours
to
be
agreeable
to
the
bore
husband
and
spoke
of
subjects
which
were
in
his
ken
and
gerard
watching
her
admired
the
progress
of
his
pupil
no
one
of
his
world
or
any
world
could
have
been
a
more
polished
or
enchanting
guest
and
his
pride
in
her
numbed
the
pain
he
had
felt
all
the
day
then
the
conversation
became
general
and
gave
fresh
opportunity
for
katherine
to
show
her
powers
of
repartee
yes
the
quartette
played
bridge
and
began
it
almost
immediately
the
men
joined
the
ladies
upstairs
strobridge
had
carefully
not
allowed
the
talk
to
stray
to
any
personal
subject
while
they
were
alone
in
the
in
case
the
duke
should
question
him
about
katherine
if
so
he
would
have
been
forced
to
say
who
she
was
and
that
would
spoil
her
plans
perhaps
how
she
meant
to
get
out
of
the
dilemma
afterwards
he
did
not
speculate
all
pretence
was
so
foreign
to
her
nature
but
that
was
her
affair
his
only
concern
was
that
this
evening
should
be
without
flaw
the
duke
found
a
place
on
the
sofa
beside
katherine
as
soon
as
the
rest
began
their
rubber
and
here
he
could
look
at
her
undisturbed
and
without
craning
his
neck
he
admired
her
extremely
she
was
the
exact
type
which
pleased
him
distinguished
and
looking
he
liked
the
way
she
spoke
with
no
distressingly
modern
slang
in
her
phrases
she
must
evidently
have
been
most
carefully
brought
up
in
a
really
refined
home
could
she
be
a
relation
of
the
but
to
ask
questions
of
this
sort
was
not
his
method
and
he
turned
the
conversation
back
to
eothen
again
and
kindred
things
katherine
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
she
was
blooming
like
a
glowing
plant
and
seemed
to
radiate
sweetness
and
serenity
every
now
and
then
she
let
her
eyes
meet
his
ones
with
that
strange
magnetic
look
in
hers
which
she
knew
would
compel
his
interest
they
spoke
of
music
and
poetry
and
then
of
pictures
pictures
in
general
and
lastly
those
of
blissington
did
she
know
blissington
well
yes
she
knew
it
very
well
and
that
enigmatic
smile
hovered
for
a
moment
round
her
lips
mordryn
was
surprised
at
it
it
contains
some
recollections
for
you
which
are
humorous
then
yes
very
humorous
wo
you
tell
me
what
they
are
his
most
attractive
face
came
a
little
nearer
to
her
in
his
interest
some
day
you
will
know
how
fraught
with
meaning
day
i
shall
know
not
then
no
for
we
are
guests
at
a
and
are
talking
about
literature
and
music
and
art
but
i
want
to
talk
about
you
may
i
not
i
do
not
see
why
you
should
i
am
just
a
person
whom
you
will
never
really
see
again
i
mean
never
really
talk
to
again
so
why
waste
time
in
unprofitable
investigations
how
do
you
know
that
they
would
be
unprofitable
katherine
looked
down
at
her
own
white
hands
folded
quietly
in
her
lap
then
up
again
and
straight
into
his
eyes
this
night
week
if
you
chance
to
think
of
this
evening
you
will
realise
how
right
i
am
as
to
their
complete
unprofitableness
illustration
are
ready
for
the
great
adventure
you
speak
in
riddles
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
slightly
and
smiled
his
grace
found
himself
distinctly
curious
why
should
you
be
so
sure
that
i
shall
never
really
see
or
was
it
speak
to
you
again
do
you
then
live
on
some
desert
island
off
the
north
of
scotland
by
chance
in
a
much
more
inaccessible
place
than
that
her
eyes
sparkled
with
some
unfathomable
expression
iceland
there
is
an
ice
barrier
surrounding
it
i
shall
have
to
give
it
up
and
you
will
tell
me
yourself
out
of
gratitude
for
ceasing
to
tease
you
katherine
leaned
back
on
the
soft
green
silk
cushions
of
the
sofa
she
was
looking
most
alluring
in
her
new
r√¥le
of
honoured
guest
it
was
so
delightful
to
be
perfectly
at
ease
and
able
to
lean
there
and
not
sit
bolt
upright
in
a
chair
in
an
attitude
of
respect
the
duke
found
the
sight
of
her
extremely
soothing
you
come
to
london
sometimes
i
expect
yes
for
a
part
of
the
year
ah
i
thought
so
i
did
not
believe
that
iceland
produced
such
a
polished
creature
you
know
you
are
quite
unusual
miss
bush
you
have
consented
without
apparent
reluctance
to
talk
upon
interesting
subjects
to
a
wearied
and
man
and
you
have
not
spoken
of
golf
or
dancing
and
you
have
not
smoked
i
do
smoke
sometimes
but
only
when
i
am
doing
some
tiresome
mechanical
work
like
typing
typing
i
suppose
it
is
useful
but
what
can
you
have
to
type
are
you
writing
a
book
katherine
gave
a
sudden
soft
laugh
infinitely
provoking
it
made
the
blood
run
in
gerard
strobridge
veins
and
he
viciously
played
a
knave
while
quivering
with
a
sense
of
rebellion
he
knew
what
it
meant
when
she
laughed
like
that
when
would
this
ghastly
evening
end
and
katherine
half
whispered
no
not
writing
one
but
trying
to
learn
out
of
that
greatest
volume
of
all
time
the
book
of
life
what
can
you
know
of
life
the
duke
asked
the
question
as
gerard
strobridge
had
asked
it
long
ago
protected
and
pampered
and
kept
from
all
but
its
pleasant
sides
what
can
girls
of
our
class
know
of
life
tell
me
then
what
it
is
since
i
could
not
be
supposed
to
know
and
her
mouth
still
looked
mischievous
as
well
as
her
eyes
the
duke
thrilled
a
little
life
is
either
a
muddle
through
or
an
achievement
and
it
contains
good
things
and
bad
things
and
passions
and
it
is
forever
trying
to
express
itself
and
proclaim
its
meaning
quite
regardless
of
laws
is
not
to
stalk
about
and
draw
fresh
air
from
time
to
time
or
gaze
upon
the
sun
oh
it
is
a
splendid
thing
katherine
cried
and
her
voice
vibrated
and
unlike
the
i
shall
not
weary
of
the
bewildering
masquerade
strangers
walk
as
friends
and
friends
as
strangers
and
even
if
they
did
the
unexpectedness
of
it
would
be
delightful
mordryn
looked
at
her
at
the
fresh
young
firm
smooth
cheeks
the
living
red
voluptuous
mouth
the
hair
every
strand
of
which
seemed
to
be
specially
alive
and
to
hold
its
own
silvery
glitter
and
then
at
her
strange
compelling
eyes
and
he
sighed
a
little
she
seemed
such
an
embodiment
of
vital
things
you
are
ready
for
the
great
adventure
quite
and
i
mean
to
know
everything
before
i
grow
old
and
indifferent
he
sighed
again
age
does
not
always
produce
indifference
it
would
be
merciful
if
it
did
there
can
be
no
need
really
to
grow
old
age
comes
because
people
lose
their
grip
on
things
probably
but
responsibilities
and
sorrows
and
disappointments
age
you
have
no
doubt
a
very
sheltered
life
and
so
it
seems
to
you
that
all
is
easy
katherine
laughed
again
softly
it
was
so
delicious
to
think
of
the
reality
in
contrast
to
his
supposition
my
life
is
indeed
sheltered
by
a
very
strong
shield
but
not
by
the
one
your
words
would
suggest
no
what
then
it
is
not
at
all
interesting
to
talk
of
me
i
have
already
told
you
so
why
do
you
persist
i
would
much
rather
hear
of
foreign
countries
italy
for
instance
i
have
never
been
there
there
was
not
the
least
subjective
deference
in
her
manner
to
him
it
was
as
if
an
equal
were
talking
to
one
of
her
own
brain
calibre
and
that
equal
a
woman
who
had
a
right
to
be
humoured
women
especially
girls
were
not
wont
so
to
treat
him
but
were
always
more
or
less
impressed
by
his
great
position
or
his
aloofness
or
his
satirical
but
courteous
wit
he
had
sometimes
an
expression
of
contemptuous
amiable
tolerance
which
was
eighteenth
century
and
disconcerting
it
made
all
but
the
most
simple
or
most
highly
cultivated
among
them
slightly
uneasy
was
he
laughing
at
them
they
were
never
quite
sure
he
found
himself
piqued
now
and
in
no
mood
to
be
balked
so
he
contradicted
katherine
you
may
not
find
yourself
interesting
to
talk
about
it
chances
that
i
do
i
wish
to
know
what
it
is
that
shields
you
so
effectively
a
clear
idea
of
what
i
want
i
expect
and
a
strong
enough
will
not
to
be
much
buffeted
about
by
any
wind
of
opinion
what
a
and
you
look
so
young
i
am
that
is
fully
grown
and
what
is
it
you
want
to
be
free
to
soar
to
see
the
world
to
feel
its
throb
to
demonstrate
some
of
my
ideas
on
what
subjects
the
meanings
of
things
and
why
they
are
and
the
common
sense
aspect
of
them
then
one
could
help
humanity
lady
garribardine
is
my
ideal
of
what
a
woman
should
be
there
is
nothing
small
about
her
she
is
as
big
as
a
great
man
and
far
more
sagacious
there
i
am
with
you
and
his
voice
became
eager
her
ladyship
has
always
been
the
perfection
of
things
feminine
in
my
opinion
you
know
her
well
extremely
well
she
is
not
afraid
of
her
views
and
principles
she
is
really
an
aristocrat
she
believes
in
herself
so
everyone
believes
in
her
too
most
of
us
are
shaky
about
ourselves
you
are
not
i
shall
turn
the
tables
now
and
say
i
want
to
talk
about
you
what
does
it
feel
like
to
be
a
duke
a
real
duke
not
a
or
one
who
makes
a
laughing
stock
of
his
order
he
smiled
she
was
a
most
engaging
and
audacious
young
person
because
she
did
not
speak
with
childish
artlessness
but
with
deliberation
it
feels
a
great
responsibility
sometimes
and
a
thing
of
very
little
consequence
at
others
it
enforces
perhaps
a
standard
of
behaviour
which
it
is
difficult
always
to
follow
if
the
circumstances
of
my
life
had
been
different
when
i
was
younger
i
should
have
endeavoured
not
to
let
our
order
slip
into
impotency
now
the
whole
modern
political
outlook
disgusts
me
so
that
i
seldom
speak
in
the
house
that
is
very
wrong
of
you
and
cowardly
she
was
quite
fearless
you
should
never
give
up
a
fight
or
remain
passive
when
what
really
belongs
to
you
is
being
filched
from
you
if
you
do
as
a
band
you
deserve
to
be
put
aside
you
should
fight
with
the
same
fierceness
with
which
those
radicals
do
who
know
they
are
shams
but
are
indeed
in
earnest
to
obtain
their
own
ends
you
are
quite
right
there
are
some
women
who
stimulate
in
all
ways
who
are
as
it
were
sent
into
the
world
as
electric
dynamos
they
get
the
best
out
of
everyone
they
make
men
work
better
and
play
better
and
love
better
he
looked
at
her
now
with
his
fine
eyes
sparkling
but
flirtation
was
far
beneath
his
feet
to
his
mistresses
he
was
a
master
a
generous
tolerant
contemptuous
master
to
his
friends
like
lady
garribardine
the
essence
of
courtly
consideration
to
the
general
company
politely
aloof
but
to
the
woman
who
could
arouse
his
love
what
might
he
not
be
katherine
thought
this
and
a
quiver
ran
through
her
of
a
kind
she
had
never
experienced
before
so
that
her
composure
was
not
so
perfect
as
usual
when
she
answered
if
one
really
knew
exactly
what
is
love
you
have
no
dim
guess
at
it
then
he
was
quite
surprised
that
it
should
interest
him
to
know
what
her
reply
would
be
yes
i
have
more
than
that
i
know
that
some
phases
of
it
make
one
feel
mad
agitated
unbalanced
animal
even
motherly
and
protective
but
what
it
could
be
if
it
touched
the
soul
i
can
not
fathom
the
duke
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
he
was
filled
with
wonder
and
a
growing
admiration
admiration
which
extended
even
beyond
the
very
real
appreciation
of
her
beauty
her
mentality
was
so
far
above
the
average
her
directness
so
interesting
there
was
not
the
slightest
trace
of
pose
in
anything
she
said
and
that
last
speech
what
possibilities
it
opened
up
she
knew
something
of
one
side
of
love
then
evidently
do
you
realise
what
your
words
imply
yes
that
you
have
loved
someone
in
that
way
once
yes
i
have
it
is
a
way
that
frightens
one
and
makes
one
more
than
ever
sure
that
there
must
be
something
else
do
you
know
that
there
is
you
who
have
lived
your
life
her
face
was
pale
and
cool
as
moonbeams
she
seemed
to
be
talking
in
the
abstract
for
all
the
personal
question
the
duke
found
himself
quite
unaccountably
moved
and
was
just
about
to
answer
eagerly
when
at
that
moment
the
host
joined
them
from
the
other
the
rubber
was
over
and
he
felt
he
must
do
his
duty
and
not
make
too
obvious
a
point
of
leaving
the
pair
alone
come
and
see
the
miniatures
mordryn
he
said
we
must
not
forget
that
it
was
their
lure
which
brought
you
here
his
tone
katherine
well
understood
it
contained
for
all
its
surface
graciousness
some
bitterness
underneath
there
was
general
movement
after
this
and
no
more
private
confidences
could
be
exchanged
so
that
miss
and
katherine
left
with
his
grace
answer
to
the
latter
question
still
unspoken
and
gerard
strobridge
as
he
pressed
katherine
hand
in
whispered
have
i
done
well
and
are
you
satisfied
the
firm
clasp
of
her
cool
fingers
was
his
answer
chapter
xxv
lady
garribardine
was
unable
to
spare
her
secretary
from
the
easter
party
so
it
had
been
arranged
that
she
was
to
have
a
few
days
holiday
from
the
saturday
following
the
but
she
must
catch
the
three
train
from
paddington
on
the
thursday
before
easter
and
return
then
katherine
did
not
go
home
to
bindon
green
she
went
off
alone
to
a
little
place
by
the
sea
on
the
east
coast
and
there
she
set
herself
to
review
events
and
think
out
her
plans
while
she
lay
upon
the
sands
unheeding
the
east
wind
gerard
strobridge
had
served
her
loyally
the
interest
which
she
had
meant
to
kindle
was
kindled
the
duke
now
had
made
a
mental
picture
of
her
unmarred
by
possible
qualifications
which
if
he
had
known
she
was
his
friend
humble
secretary
and
typist
he
would
have
been
bound
to
have
made
not
that
he
was
in
the
least
a
snob
but
that
he
would
have
naturally
considered
it
unbefitting
his
situation
to
go
about
looking
for
interesting
companions
among
his
friend
dependents
he
would
simply
not
have
observed
her
at
all
when
he
came
to
blissington
any
more
than
she
herself
had
observed
either
of
the
footmen
at
gerard
strobridge
dinner
not
that
she
despised
footmen
as
footmen
or
the
duke
secretaries
as
secretaries
they
were
worthy
and
necessary
servants
but
guests
did
not
remark
them
except
in
their
professional
capacities
people
who
were
there
to
serve
at
table
or
write
letters
and
attend
to
business
not
the
slightest
irritation
or
resentment
mingled
with
these
reflections
of
katherine
she
was
much
too
wise
and
just
and
never
under
the
influence
of
hurt
vanity
or
dramatic
instinct
so
this
point
of
view
that
she
knew
the
duke
would
naturally
take
seemed
to
her
perfectly
right
and
instead
of
resenting
it
she
had
used
her
brain
to
nullify
it
knowing
full
well
that
if
she
played
her
part
at
the
dinner
effectually
interest
would
be
aroused
which
no
barrier
of
different
statuses
could
entirely
obliterate
afterwards
now
on
this
last
afternoon
at
bayview
she
must
think
out
what
she
would
do
next
for
the
duke
would
be
arriving
at
blissington
by
a
train
from
the
west
which
got
in
a
few
minutes
after
her
own
from
paddington
she
had
known
before
the
that
he
was
coming
for
easter
and
that
morning
had
received
a
command
from
her
mistress
that
she
was
to
look
out
for
him
and
tell
him
he
was
to
take
the
small
coup√©
and
not
get
into
the
other
motor
which
would
await
her
and
be
loaded
up
with
fragile
which
were
coming
by
katherine
train
there
would
be
the
luggage
car
for
his
servant
and
his
trunks
as
well
all
the
rest
of
the
guests
were
arriving
by
motors
or
by
the
express
an
hour
later
thus
the
plunge
from
equal
to
humble
secretary
would
have
to
be
made
at
once
and
she
must
see
to
it
that
it
was
done
with
tact
and
skill
so
as
not
to
mar
the
effect
already
produced
but
rather
enhance
it
there
was
only
one
drop
in
her
cup
she
did
not
feel
altogether
happy
in
keeping
this
secret
from
her
beloved
mistress
a
secret
too
which
concerned
her
perhaps
most
valued
guest
but
it
was
absolutely
impossible
that
she
could
frankly
avow
her
intentions
to
lady
garribardine
as
she
had
done
to
gerard
so
much
she
would
keep
to
herself
but
she
would
speak
of
her
enjoyment
at
meeting
the
duke
if
her
ladyship
did
not
herself
begin
the
subject
and
she
had
not
reason
to
believe
strobridge
had
told
his
aunt
of
the
encounter
she
had
not
seen
lady
garribardine
since
the
dinner
having
left
for
her
holiday
very
early
on
the
saturday
morning
all
the
way
down
in
the
train
to
blissington
she
was
conscious
of
suppressed
excitement
she
had
been
most
careful
about
her
appearance
and
looked
as
charming
and
yet
unobtrusive
as
it
was
possible
to
look
she
waited
when
once
arrived
at
the
entrance
where
the
subway
from
the
departure
platform
emerged
and
she
felt
a
quiver
when
she
saw
the
top
of
the
duke
hat
and
then
his
face
how
attractive
he
looked
and
how
unlike
other
people
among
a
crowd
he
was
a
magnificent
personality
one
to
whom
porters
and
officials
and
strangers
naturally
showed
deference
peers
could
look
like
very
humble
and
sometimes
even
vulgar
people
she
knew
but
no
man
woman
or
child
could
mistake
his
grace
of
mordryn
for
anything
but
a
great
noble
when
he
caught
sight
of
katherine
standing
just
at
the
inside
of
the
stream
of
passengers
his
whole
stern
face
changed
and
an
illuminating
smile
came
over
it
while
he
stretched
out
his
hand
cordially
miss
bush
are
we
to
be
fellow
guests
you
are
coming
to
blissington
how
delightful
katherine
made
as
though
she
did
not
see
the
hand
and
with
deference
and
lowered
lids
she
said
yes
i
am
going
to
blissington
but
your
grace
is
under
a
misapprehension
which
i
must
correct
i
am
her
ladyship
typist
and
secretary
and
i
am
here
now
to
give
you
a
message
that
you
are
to
take
her
ladyship
own
small
coup√©
and
not
the
motor
which
is
waiting
for
the
bandboxes
and
me
but
with
all
her
demureness
she
could
not
prevent
an
irresistible
and
humorous
quiver
from
dimpling
round
her
lips
and
then
she
raised
her
steady
eyes
and
looked
at
him
suddenly
as
she
bowed
and
moved
off
quickly
leaving
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
completely
nonplussed
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
comedy
he
felt
rather
angry
what
business
had
gerard
strobridge
to
trick
him
so
but
had
he
tricked
him
he
recollected
now
that
miss
bush
had
not
been
mentioned
by
gerard
at
all
one
way
or
another
she
was
simply
treated
as
any
other
guest
and
had
come
apparently
with
gwendoline
that
she
was
a
lady
his
own
senses
had
told
him
whether
she
were
a
typist
or
no
highly
bred
and
educated
and
exceptionally
cultivated
and
refined
she
must
certainly
be
the
daughter
of
some
friend
of
sarah
who
had
met
with
financial
misfortune
poor
charming
girl
and
he
hurried
after
her
but
only
got
outside
the
station
to
see
her
disappear
in
a
motor
already
piled
up
inside
with
milliner
boxes
so
baffled
and
still
deeply
interested
he
entered
the
coup√©
awaiting
him
and
was
whirled
off
seraphim
would
of
course
tell
him
all
about
it
and
so
he
dismissed
the
matter
from
his
mind
but
his
first
thought
when
he
got
into
the
hall
was
to
wonder
if
katherine
would
be
at
tea
she
was
not
tea
was
a
affair
in
his
old
friend
boudoir
where
a
hundred
thousand
things
of
interest
had
to
be
discussed
between
them
and
no
time
or
chance
was
given
for
reference
to
obscure
secretaries
after
tea
on
her
way
down
to
receive
the
guests
who
would
continue
to
arrive
in
relays
until
dressing
time
lady
garribardine
went
into
the
schoolroom
to
see
katherine
they
spoke
of
business
and
katherine
received
orders
and
took
down
notes
and
then
she
said
your
ladyship
will
be
amused
to
hear
that
i
met
the
duke
at
dinner
at
strobridge
he
did
not
know
my
position
and
i
am
afraid
at
the
time
i
did
not
undeceive
him
it
was
such
a
very
great
pleasure
to
me
to
be
taken
for
a
lady
and
a
guest
just
for
once
of
course
i
told
him
at
the
station
my
real
position
and
he
appeared
much
surprised
lady
garribardine
walked
to
the
window
and
pretended
to
be
looking
out
at
something
she
wanted
to
hide
all
the
expression
which
might
come
into
her
eyes
the
simple
words
it
was
such
a
very
great
pleasure
to
be
taken
for
a
lady
and
a
guest
just
for
once
had
deeply
touched
her
she
seemed
to
realise
what
such
a
spirit
as
katherine
must
feel
always
in
a
subordinate
position
of
no
particular
status
and
with
what
dignity
she
carried
it
off
child
she
answered
without
looking
round
no
one
who
knows
you
would
ever
take
you
for
anything
else
the
theory
of
blood
being
absolutely
necessary
for
this
you
have
proved
to
be
nonsense
the
duke
is
one
of
my
oldest
friends
and
a
very
fine
gentleman
i
am
glad
you
had
a
chance
of
talking
freely
to
him
after
she
had
left
the
room
katherine
folded
and
unfolded
a
bit
of
paper
a
very
unusual
agitation
moving
her
oh
i
wish
i
could
tell
her
outright
my
dear
lady
she
cried
to
herself
i
almost
believe
she
would
sympathise
with
me
but
if
i
see
that
she
would
not
and
that
it
would
hurt
and
anger
her
i
will
give
up
even
this
my
ambition
gerard
strobridge
was
not
of
this
party
he
had
been
obliged
to
go
to
his
brother
so
katherine
would
have
no
collaborator
and
would
be
forced
to
act
alone
she
did
not
dine
downstairs
but
was
required
in
the
afterwards
and
until
ten
she
stayed
alone
in
her
wondering
what
the
duke
had
thought
and
if
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
have
stayed
for
a
minute
after
firing
her
bomb
had
she
known
it
nothing
to
chain
his
interest
could
have
been
better
than
her
swift
disappearance
for
he
was
now
thinking
of
her
and
at
the
first
opportunity
between
the
soup
and
fish
he
said
to
his
hostess
seraphim
i
met
your
secretary
it
seems
the
other
night
at
gerard
a
very
intelligent
girl
i
had
no
idea
at
the
time
that
she
was
in
any
dependent
position
and
was
greatly
surprised
when
she
addressed
me
at
the
station
as
grace
she
is
some
misfortunate
friend
daughter
i
suppose
anyone
i
knew
lady
garribardine
eyes
beamed
with
a
momentary
twinkle
which
she
suppressed
she
thought
of
the
auctioneer
father
and
the
butcher
grandfather
and
then
she
said
casually
no
she
came
from
an
advertisement
but
she
is
a
splendid
creature
with
more
sense
in
her
little
finger
than
most
of
us
have
in
our
entire
bodies
what
do
you
think
of
my
grey
locks
mordryn
the
duke
assured
her
he
found
them
bewitching
he
saw
that
she
did
not
mean
to
speak
of
her
secretary
they
cause
you
to
look
ten
years
younger
dear
friend
i
could
find
it
in
my
heart
to
make
love
to
you
once
more
and
be
repulsed
with
unabated
violence
i
fear
love
was
good
when
we
were
young
mordryn
ten
or
twelve
years
do
not
matter
when
a
man
is
and
a
woman
to
that
is
if
they
are
not
married
the
discrepancy
in
age
only
becomes
grotesque
later
we
loved
and
laughed
and
lived
then
and
should
be
grateful
i
am
as
for
you
you
will
love
again
for
a
man
is
nothing
you
are
abominably
attractive
you
know
mordryn
with
your
weary
aloof
air
and
your
dukedom
and
now
that
you
are
altogether
free
from
anxieties
you
should
take
the
cup
of
joy
in
both
hands
and
quaff
it
look
round
the
table
have
i
not
provided
some
sweet
creatures
for
you
you
have
indeed
which
one
in
particular
have
you
destined
for
the
any
one
of
the
three
on
that
side
towards
the
top
you
ca
have
brains
and
beauty
lily
trevelyan
has
beauty
and
enough
tact
to
hide
her
absence
of
brain
blanche
montague
has
no
beauty
but
a
certain
chic
and
i
am
told
wonderful
variety
of
talent
she
does
not
satiate
her
admirers
with
sameness
while
julia
scarrisbrooke
is
all
passion
so
well
assumed
as
to
be
better
than
the
real
article
and
always
handy
these
credentials
i
have
collected
from
a
cohort
of
past
admirers
and
they
can
be
vouched
for
you
have
only
to
choose
any
one
of
them
will
be
enchanted
they
are
only
waiting
to
spring
into
your
arms
i
believe
that
would
bore
me
i
want
someone
who
is
not
enchanted
someone
who
leaves
the
whole
initiative
to
me
her
ladyship
cast
up
her
eyes
my
dear
mordryn
your
unsophistication
pains
me
who
ever
heard
of
a
duke
of
well
preserved
unmarried
and
distinguished
known
to
be
generous
as
a
lover
and
full
of
charm
being
allowed
to
take
the
initiative
with
women
fie
the
duke
laughed
and
by
some
curious
turn
of
fancy
he
seemed
to
see
the
white
perfectly
composed
face
of
the
stately
slender
secretary
who
had
treated
him
as
naught
that
night
at
gerard
and
then
looked
almost
mockingly
respectful
when
she
called
him
your
grace
in
the
station
would
she
be
in
the
after
dinner
perhaps
yes
she
was
over
by
the
piano
at
the
far
end
but
lily
trevelyan
and
blanche
montague
and
julia
scarrisbrooke
had
surrounded
him
before
he
could
get
down
the
long
room
and
escape
was
out
of
the
question
no
manoeuvring
enabled
him
to
break
free
of
them
so
he
had
to
sit
and
be
purred
at
and
see
with
the
tail
of
his
eye
a
graceful
creature
in
black
talking
quietly
and
intelligently
he
felt
sure
to
some
less
important
guest
and
then
playing
accompaniments
and
then
slipping
away
through
a
door
at
that
end
presumably
to
bed
he
cursed
civilisation
he
profoundly
cursed
beautiful
ladies
and
he
became
sarcastic
and
caused
julia
and
lily
who
were
for
the
moment
bosom
friends
to
confide
to
each
other
over
the
latter
bedroom
fire
that
mordryn
was
too
darling
for
words
but
spiteful
as
her
ladyship
black
cat
i
do
hate
men
to
be
so
clever
do
you
lil
one
never
knows
where
one
is
with
them
oh
but
ju
dearest
he
is
deformed
or
deadly
dull
or
diseased
or
tipsy
he
is
awfully
good
looking
and
very
rich
and
really
you
ca
have
everything
i
thought
blanche
montague
was
shockingly
open
in
her
desire
to
secure
him
did
not
you
i
wonder
why
sarah
asked
her
here
with
us
meanwhile
katherine
bush
did
not
permit
herself
to
wonder
at
his
possible
feelings
or
his
future
actions
at
all
she
had
seen
the
eager
look
in
his
dark
blue
eyes
once
or
twice
across
the
room
and
being
a
wise
woman
left
things
to
fate
i
wish
were
here
the
hostess
said
to
herself
as
she
too
stood
by
a
bedroom
fire
her
own
i
have
no
one
to
exchange
unspoken
confidence
with
he
would
have
understood
and
appreciated
the
enchanting
comedy
of
female
purpose
male
instinct
to
flee
and
one
young
woman
supreme
intelligence
the
next
day
the
duke
who
knew
the
house
well
and
in
what
wing
miss
arnott
had
worked
took
it
into
his
head
to
walk
before
breakfast
in
the
rose
garden
miss
bush
saw
him
from
the
window
and
allowed
herself
to
bow
gravely
when
he
deliberately
looked
up
then
she
moved
away
he
felt
a
distinct
sensation
of
tantalization
after
breakfast
everyone
would
play
tennis
he
played
an
extraordinarily
good
game
himself
and
was
in
flannels
ready
katherine
thought
he
had
a
very
fine
figure
and
looked
much
younger
in
those
clothes
she
wanted
to
ask
him
about
the
emerald
ring
she
wanted
to
ask
him
about
a
number
of
things
she
had
work
to
do
all
the
morning
but
came
out
to
the
tennis
lawn
with
a
message
to
her
mistress
just
before
luncheon
during
an
exciting
single
match
between
the
duke
and
an
agile
young
man
the
last
game
was
at
all
and
katherine
paused
to
watch
the
strokes
and
then
mordryn
won
amidst
shouts
of
applause
katherine
had
remarked
that
he
ran
about
very
little
and
won
by
sheer
style
and
skill
and
hard
hitting
she
did
not
loiter
a
second
when
he
was
free
to
move
but
flitted
back
to
the
house
before
he
could
get
near
her
she
lunched
alone
in
her
schoolroom
by
the
afternoon
when
she
did
appear
at
tea
the
duke
was
thoroughly
he
knew
not
why
or
for
what
reason
merely
that
his
mood
was
so
katherine
busy
with
the
teapot
only
raised
her
head
to
give
a
polite
respectful
bow
in
answer
to
his
greeting
he
was
infinitely
too
much
a
man
of
the
world
to
single
out
the
humble
secretary
and
draw
upon
her
the
wrath
of
these
lovely
guests
so
he
contented
himself
by
watching
her
and
noting
her
unconcerned
air
and
easy
grace
some
of
the
people
seemed
to
know
her
well
and
be
very
friendly
with
her
she
showed
not
the
slightest
sign
of
a
desire
to
speak
to
him
could
it
be
possible
that
this
was
the
girl
who
only
that
night
week
had
talked
with
him
upon
the
enthralling
subject
of
love
those
utterances
of
hers
which
had
sounded
so
cryptic
at
the
time
were
intelligible
now
how
subtle
had
been
her
comprehension
of
the
situation
he
remembered
her
face
when
he
had
asked
her
if
she
knew
blissington
and
again
when
she
had
told
him
that
that
night
week
he
would
know
how
altogether
unprofitable
any
investigations
regarding
her
would
be
and
now
in
the
character
of
humble
secretary
she
was
just
as
complete
as
she
had
been
when
apparently
a
fellow
guest
and
social
equal
it
was
all
annoyingly
disturbing
it
placed
him
in
a
false
position
and
her
in
one
in
which
she
held
all
the
advantages
and
there
she
sat
serene
and
dignified
hedged
round
with
that
barrier
of
ice
of
which
she
had
spoken
he
had
not
experienced
such
perplexing
emotions
for
many
years
he
wanted
to
talk
to
her
he
wanted
to
ask
her
what
it
all
meant
he
would
like
to
know
her
history
and
whence
she
had
come
gwendoline
had
treated
her
he
had
noticed
not
as
a
dependent
but
as
a
friend
he
felt
himself
rather
awkward
he
a
man
of
the
world
accustomed
to
homage
from
women
he
did
manage
to
say
that
it
was
a
bore
that
the
rain
had
come
on
and
it
looked
as
though
would
be
wet
and
he
felt
humiliated
at
the
fine
instantly
suppressed
smile
which
flickered
round
her
mouth
at
this
brilliant
remark
from
an
acknowledged
wit
then
he
became
angry
with
himself
what
matter
to
him
whether
she
smiled
or
did
not
smile
it
was
obvious
that
he
could
not
be
on
terms
of
familiar
friendship
with
seraphim
secretary
at
his
age
and
with
his
position
so
he
had
strength
of
mind
to
move
away
from
the
table
and
to
allow
himself
to
be
purred
over
by
one
of
the
trio
of
charmers
who
had
been
asked
for
his
benefit
but
rage
mounted
in
his
breast
he
was
not
enjoying
himself
at
all
and
if
he
did
not
see
more
of
his
old
friend
herself
he
really
would
not
stay
over
monday
as
he
had
intended
but
would
go
back
to
town
on
sunday
night
lady
garribardine
knew
the
signs
of
the
times
and
took
him
off
to
her
after
tea
when
most
of
the
others
began
to
play
bridge
i
think
modern
women
have
less
charm
than
they
had
seraphim
the
duke
said
from
the
depths
of
an
armchair
rather
acidly
they
are
almost
as
illiterate
as
ladies
of
the
ballet
used
to
be
when
i
was
young
they
are
quite
as
slangy
and
noisy
and
they
are
full
of
affectations
if
one
does
not
know
the
last
word
of
their
fashionable
jargon
and
can
not
keep
up
a
constant
flow
of
talk
which
incidentally
it
would
require
the
wit
of
the
james
street
cabmen
of
twenty
years
ago
to
be
able
to
do
one
is
asphyxiated
by
them
i
shall
have
to
become
acclimated
i
feel
i
have
been
too
long
away
and
have
lost
touch
with
the
movement
i
sigh
for
repose
and
peace
nonsense
mordryn
it
will
do
you
a
great
deal
of
good
to
be
shaken
up
you
must
move
with
the
times
but
i
entirely
decline
to
do
so
to
what
end
you
must
certainly
marry
again
now
that
you
are
at
last
free
undoubtedly
it
is
my
obvious
duty
as
otherwise
the
title
will
die
out
but
surely
you
do
not
suggest
that
i
should
convert
any
of
these
charming
creatures
who
were
good
enough
to
try
to
lighten
my
mood
last
night
and
into
my
wife
i
had
hoped
they
were
at
least
safely
married
and
now
you
make
me
tremble
in
case
you
are
going
to
announce
to
me
that
some
are
widows
blanche
montague
is
i
merely
asked
the
others
to
accustom
you
to
the
modern
type
they
are
to
break
in
your
sensibilities
so
to
speak
and
next
time
you
come
if
you
do
fancy
blanche
i
will
have
a
selection
of
suitable
prospective
duchesses
will
they
make
as
much
noise
as
these
more
nothing
modern
can
be
dignified
or
quiet
so
get
the
idea
out
of
your
head
they
are
all
so
out
of
door
and
so
hearty
such
delightful
fresh
knowing
supremely
uninnocent
jolly
good
fellows
they
ca
be
silent
or
keep
still
there
are
too
many
new
to
be
talked
about
and
too
much
golf
to
be
played
and
new
american
nigger
dances
to
be
come
come
mordryn
you
do
not
want
to
be
ridiculously
and
really
blanche
montague
is
most
suitable
montague
left
her
well
provided
for
and
she
was
only
last
birthday
but
i
do
like
her
voice
and
what
should
we
converse
about
in
the
blanche
is
famous
for
her
small
talk
she
will
start
upon
any
subject
under
the
sun
you
please
and
change
it
before
you
can
answer
the
first
question
no
fear
of
stagnation
there
even
the
description
tires
me
i
prefer
the
lady
who
you
assured
me
was
all
simulated
passion
i
adore
passion
though
i
confess
i
prefer
it
to
be
real
how
captious
of
you
the
thing
is
unknown
in
these
days
it
has
to
be
reconstructed
like
the
modern
rubies
lots
of
little
fragments
pressed
into
a
whole
by
scientific
a
good
imitation
is
all
you
will
get
mordryn
i
loathe
imitations
and
his
grace
shuddered
i
think
you
had
better
give
me
an
exact
description
of
what
you
do
want
for
my
poor
old
friend
you
seem
to
be
out
to
court
disappointment
i
earnestly
desire
to
help
you
into
a
second
noose
more
satisfactory
than
the
one
i
originally
placed
around
your
neck
so
out
with
it
a
full
description
the
duke
deliberately
lit
a
cigarette
and
a
gleam
of
firelight
caught
his
emerald
ring
your
famous
talisman
is
flashing
mordryn
the
lyre
shows
that
it
approves
of
your
thoughts
the
woman
i
should
like
to
marry
must
be
and
look
supremely
but
healthy
and
normal
not
overbred
like
poor
laura
and
gerard
wife
she
must
be
able
to
talk
upon
the
subjects
which
interest
one
a
person
of
cultivation
in
short
she
must
have
a
sense
of
humour
and
fine
ideals
and
a
strong
feeling
about
the
responsibilities
of
the
position
and
be
above
all
things
dignified
and
quiet
and
and
i
should
like
and
here
a
faint
deprecatory
smile
flickered
about
his
mouth
for
a
moment
i
should
like
her
to
love
me
and
take
a
little
interest
in
the
human
tangible
side
of
the
affair
if
you
do
not
think
i
am
asking
too
much
of
fate
at
my
age
it
is
a
large
order
i
only
know
of
one
woman
who
answers
to
your
requirements
and
she
of
course
is
entirely
out
of
the
question
who
is
she
and
why
is
she
out
of
the
question
useless
to
answer
either
query
since
as
i
say
she
is
altogether
out
of
the
running
it
was
only
an
idea
of
mine
but
i
will
diligently
seek
for
your
paragon
for
mordryn
i
shall
never
feel
my
conscience
clear
until
i
see
you
happily
told
off
and
the
father
of
at
least
six
sturdy
boys
the
duke
raised
his
hands
in
deprecation
heavens
seraphim
you
would
overwhelm
me
with
a
litter
then
my
wants
in
that
direction
are
modest
the
full
has
never
appealed
to
me
i
want
my
wife
to
be
my
loved
companion
my
darling
if
you
will
but
not
not
a
rabbit
when
he
was
dressing
for
dinner
he
thought
over
his
friend
words
he
had
not
insisted
upon
knowing
who
the
one
woman
could
be
he
himself
had
lately
seen
a
creature
who
seemingly
as
far
as
he
could
judge
from
one
evening
acquaintance
possessed
quite
a
number
of
the
necessary
qualifications
but
as
in
the
case
of
seraphim
specimen
his
was
also
completely
out
of
the
running
and
not
to
be
thought
of
in
any
capacity
alas
it
was
strange
with
this
resolution
so
firmly
fixed
in
his
mind
that
after
dinner
he
should
have
broken
loose
from
the
bevy
of
ladies
waiting
to
entrap
him
and
have
deliberately
gone
to
the
piano
to
talk
to
that
dull
little
lady
flamborough
who
was
leaning
upon
the
lid
chatting
with
miss
bush
katherine
kept
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
keyboard
with
that
meek
deferential
demureness
suitable
to
her
station
when
amidst
such
exalted
company
but
her
red
mouth
had
an
indefinable
expression
about
it
which
was
exasperating
mordryn
seized
the
first
second
in
which
lady
flamborough
attention
was
diverted
by
a
remark
from
someone
else
to
bend
down
a
little
and
say
softly
are
you
not
even
going
to
say
good
evening
to
me
miss
bush
it
is
night
week
she
looked
up
with
perfect
composure
good
evening
your
grace
he
frowned
is
that
all
as
your
grace
very
truly
remarked
it
is
night
week
and
you
think
that
has
answered
all
the
riddles
of
course
he
frowned
again
he
knew
julia
scarrisbrooke
was
swooping
down
upon
him
there
was
not
a
moment
time
to
be
lost
i
do
not
i
will
make
an
opportunity
in
which
you
will
have
to
answer
them
all
categorically
do
you
hear
katherine
thrilled
she
liked
his
haughty
bearing
the
tone
of
command
in
his
perfect
voice
she
remembered
once
when
she
and
matilda
had
been
eating
lunch
at
a
lyons
popular
caf√©
matilda
had
said
my
kitten
there
such
a
young
man
sitting
behind
you
whatever
makes
him
look
quite
different
to
everyone
else
and
she
had
turned
and
perceived
that
a
pure
greek
hermes
in
rather
shabby
modern
american
clothes
was
manipulating
a
toothpick
within
a
few
feet
of
her
and
her
eye
trained
from
museum
study
had
instantly
seen
that
it
was
the
balance
of
proportion
the
set
and
size
of
the
head
and
the
angle
of
placing
of
eyes
which
differentiated
him
so
startlingly
from
the
mass
of
humanity
surrounding
them
she
had
said
to
matilda
you
had
better
look
at
him
well
tild
you
will
never
see
such
another
in
the
whole
of
your
life
he
is
a
freak
a
perfect
survival
of
the
ancient
greek
type
he
is
exactly
right
and
not
really
it
is
all
the
other
people
who
are
wrong
and
clumsy
or
grotesque
she
thought
of
this
now
the
duke
stood
out
from
everyone
else
in
the
same
way
although
he
was
not
of
pure
greek
type
but
much
more
roman
but
there
was
that
astonishing
proportion
of
bone
and
length
of
limb
about
him
the
acknowledged
yet
indescribable
shape
of
a
thoroughbred
which
middle
age
had
not
diminished
but
rather
accentuated
she
again
noticed
his
hands
and
his
great
emerald
ring
but
she
did
not
reply
at
all
to
his
announcement
of
his
intentions
for
the
morrow
she
bent
down
and
picked
up
a
piece
of
music
which
had
fallen
to
the
floor
and
julia
scarrisbrooke
swooped
and
caught
her
prey
and
carried
it
off
into
safety
on
a
big
sofa
but
as
katherine
gazed
from
her
window
on
that
good
friday
night
up
into
the
deep
blue
sky
a
feeling
of
awe
came
over
her
at
the
magnitude
of
the
vista
fate
was
opening
in
front
of
her
eyes
chapter
xxvi
the
duke
found
great
difficulty
in
carrying
out
his
intention
on
that
saturday
for
a
duke
to
escape
from
a
brought
there
especially
to
hunt
him
is
no
easy
task
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
his
hostess
would
not
aid
him
either
and
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
appeal
to
her
sympathy
because
he
was
quite
aware
that
he
would
withhold
his
own
had
he
to
look
at
the
matter
dispassionately
as
concerning
someone
else
it
was
a
fool
errand
he
was
bent
upon
in
all
senses
of
the
phrase
but
as
this
conviction
forced
itself
upon
him
the
desire
to
see
and
talk
with
katherine
grew
stronger
it
happened
that
she
lunched
downstairs
at
such
a
large
party
as
this
that
meal
was
consumed
at
several
small
tables
of
six
each
and
of
course
the
secretary
was
not
placed
at
his
grace
indeed
she
sat
at
one
directly
at
his
back
so
that
he
could
not
see
her
though
once
in
a
pause
he
heard
her
deep
fascinating
voice
when
later
in
the
hall
coffee
and
cigarettes
had
come
katherine
passed
near
him
to
put
down
a
cup
and
he
seized
the
moment
to
address
her
in
twenty
minutes
i
am
coming
from
the
to
the
schoolroom
please
be
there
miss
bush
gave
no
sign
as
to
whether
or
no
she
heard
this
remark
which
was
made
in
a
low
voice
with
a
note
of
pleading
in
it
if
he
chose
to
do
this
she
would
make
it
quite
clear
that
she
would
have
no
clandestine
acquaintance
with
him
but
at
the
same
time
she
experienced
a
delicious
sense
of
excitement
she
was
seated
before
her
typewriter
busily
typing
innumerable
letters
when
she
heard
his
footsteps
outside
and
then
a
gentle
tap
at
the
door
come
in
she
called
and
he
appeared
his
face
looked
stern
and
not
particularly
may
i
stay
for
a
moment
in
this
haven
of
rest
miss
bush
and
he
shut
the
door
in
so
large
a
party
every
seems
to
be
overflowing
and
there
is
not
a
corner
where
one
may
talk
in
peace
katherine
had
risen
with
her
almost
overrespectful
air
which
never
concealed
the
mischievous
twinkle
in
her
eyes
when
she
raised
them
but
now
they
were
fixed
upon
the
sheets
of
paper
your
grace
is
welcome
to
that
armchair
for
a
little
but
i
am
very
occupied
lady
garribardine
wishes
these
letters
to
go
by
this
post
i
wish
you
would
not
call
me
grace
he
said
a
little
impatiently
i
can
not
realise
that
you
can
be
the
same
person
whom
i
met
at
gerard
strobridge
i
am
not
she
looked
up
at
him
why
it
is
obvious
i
was
me
myself
that
night
a
guest
and
now
your
grace
is
not
observant
i
fear
i
am
her
ladyship
secretary
of
course
but
still
he
came
over
quite
close
to
her
if
i
had
been
the
same
person
as
the
one
you
met
at
strobridge
you
would
not
now
have
been
obliged
to
contrive
to
come
to
the
schoolroom
to
speak
to
me
a
dark
flush
mounted
to
his
brow
she
had
touched
a
number
of
his
refined
sensibilities
her
words
were
so
true
and
so
simple
and
her
tone
was
quite
calm
showing
no
personal
emotion
but
merely
as
though
she
were
announcing
a
fact
that
is
unfortunately
true
but
these
are
only
ridiculous
conventions
which
please
let
us
brush
aside
may
i
really
sit
down
for
a
minute
katherine
glanced
at
the
clock
it
was
three
until
a
quarter
to
four
if
you
wish
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
spare
more
time
than
that
she
pointed
to
the
armchair
which
he
took
and
she
reseated
herself
at
the
table
folding
her
hands
there
was
a
moment
silence
the
duke
was
feeling
uncomfortably
disturbed
there
had
been
a
subtle
rebuke
conveyed
in
her
late
speech
which
he
knew
he
merited
he
had
no
right
to
have
come
there
are
you
not
going
to
talk
to
me
at
all
then
he
almost
blurted
out
i
will
answer
of
course
when
your
grace
speaks
it
is
not
for
me
to
begin
very
well
i
not
only
speak
i
implore
i
even
order
you
to
discontinue
this
ridiculous
humility
this
ridiculous
continuance
of
grace
resume
the
character
of
guest
and
let
us
enjoy
these
miserable
fifteen
minutes
but
first
i
want
to
know
what
is
the
necessity
for
your
total
change
of
manner
here
gerard
and
gwendoline
knew
that
you
were
lady
garribardine
secretary
that
night
but
they
did
not
consider
it
imperative
to
make
a
startling
difference
in
their
relations
towards
you
because
of
that
as
it
seems
that
you
would
wish
me
to
make
now
katherine
looked
down
and
then
up
again
straight
into
his
eyes
a
slight
smile
quivered
round
her
mouth
that
is
quite
different
they
know
me
very
well
and
dear
miss
gwendoline
is
not
very
intelligent
i
have
been
there
before
to
help
to
entertain
bores
for
strobridge
and
lady
beatrice
but
that
night
i
was
there
because
i
wanted
to
see
your
grace
here
she
looked
down
again
suddenly
the
duke
leaned
forward
eagerly
this
was
a
strange
confession
i
wanted
once
to
talk
to
a
man
as
an
equal
to
feel
what
it
was
like
to
be
a
lady
and
not
to
have
to
remember
to
be
respectful
so
i
deliberately
asked
strobridge
to
arrange
it
after
i
had
heard
you
speak
the
duke
was
much
astonished
and
gratified
how
frank
and
delicious
of
you
to
tell
me
this
i
thought
the
evening
was
enchanting
but
why
do
you
say
such
a
silly
thing
as
that
you
wanted
to
feel
what
it
was
like
to
be
a
lady
you
could
never
have
felt
anything
else
indeed
i
could
i
am
not
a
lady
by
birth
anything
but
only
i
have
tried
to
educate
myself
into
being
one
and
it
was
so
nice
to
have
a
chance
of
deciding
if
i
had
succeeded
or
no
and
your
verdict
was
he
raised
amused
eyebrows
she
looked
demure
by
your
grace
words
just
now
i
conclude
that
i
have
succeeded
only
by
my
words
just
now
i
thought
we
had
had
a
rather
pleasant
and
interesting
hour
of
conversation
as
yes
you
are
not
shocked
then
when
i
tell
you
that
i
am
not
really
a
lady
no
the
counterfeit
presentment
is
so
very
perfect
one
would
like
to
hear
the
details
of
the
passage
to
its
achievement
then
she
told
him
in
as
few
and
as
simple
words
as
she
could
just
the
truth
of
her
parentage
of
her
home
at
bindon
green
of
liv
and
dev
of
her
ideals
and
her
and
of
her
coming
to
lady
garribardine
mordryn
listened
with
rapt
attention
his
gaze
fixed
upon
her
face
he
made
brief
ejaculations
at
times
but
did
not
otherwise
interrupt
her
you
can
understand
now
how
entertained
i
was
at
the
things
which
you
said
to
me
that
night
can
you
not
thus
she
ended
her
story
and
the
duke
rose
and
sat
down
upon
the
edge
of
the
table
quite
close
to
her
he
was
visibly
moved
you
extraordinary
girl
you
have
upset
every
theory
i
ever
held
i
shall
go
away
now
and
think
over
all
you
have
said
meanwhile
i
feel
that
this
is
the
only
way
in
which
i
can
show
my
homage
and
he
took
her
hand
with
infinite
respect
and
kissed
it
then
he
removed
his
tall
form
from
the
table
and
quietly
left
the
room
and
when
she
was
alone
katherine
gently
touched
the
spot
where
his
lips
had
pressed
there
was
a
quite
unknown
emotion
running
through
her
she
found
it
very
difficult
to
go
on
with
her
work
after
this
and
made
a
couple
of
mistakes
to
her
great
annoyance
nearly
an
hour
passed
she
got
up
from
her
typing
and
after
changing
her
blouse
went
down
to
tea
her
thoughts
not
nearly
so
calm
as
usual
was
her
friendship
with
this
man
finished
had
her
frankness
overreached
itself
just
what
did
that
kiss
mean
here
was
a
character
not
so
easy
to
read
as
gerard
strobridge
here
was
a
will
perhaps
as
strong
as
her
own
her
face
was
very
pale
and
those
concentrated
eyes
looked
stormy
and
resentful
the
duke
reached
the
and
was
seated
at
the
only
one
moment
before
the
room
was
invaded
by
lady
garribardine
poor
mordryn
you
had
to
take
refuge
here
i
fear
those
charming
creatures
i
have
invited
for
you
are
proving
a
little
fatiguing
frankly
seraphim
they
bore
me
to
death
two
others
are
coming
of
a
different
type
presently
but
you
are
safe
in
this
corner
most
of
them
do
not
know
i
have
moved
the
to
this
wing
i
think
it
is
a
great
improvement
her
ladyship
looked
at
him
out
of
the
tail
of
her
eye
but
she
said
quite
innocently
yes
gerard
always
says
so
then
she
left
him
to
his
letters
with
a
word
as
to
tea
and
a
cosy
talk
in
her
boudoir
after
it
so
gerard
liked
this
room
too
miss
bush
was
with
him
at
the
house
she
dined
at
brook
street
then
mordryn
frowned
and
looked
the
very
image
of
the
iron
duke
and
did
not
even
begin
to
write
an
order
which
he
had
intended
to
send
his
agent
his
mind
was
disturbed
every
word
katherine
had
said
had
made
a
deep
impression
upon
him
the
father
an
auctioneer
the
grandfather
a
butcher
and
this
girl
a
peerless
creature
fit
for
a
throne
but
if
she
were
fit
for
heaven
there
were
still
quite
insurmountable
barriers
between
even
ordinary
acquaintance
with
her
he
rather
thought
he
would
leave
blissington
on
sunday
night
then
he
frowned
again
gerard
strobridge
was
a
charming
fellow
seraphim
adored
him
he
was
often
here
he
liked
the
somehow
the
conversation
must
be
turned
when
he
was
alone
with
his
friend
presently
to
the
subject
of
gerard
then
he
found
himself
going
over
every
minute
sentence
that
had
fallen
from
katherine
what
a
wonderful
wonderful
girl
how
quite
ridiculous
class
prejudices
were
how
totally
faulty
the
reasoning
of
the
world
at
tea
he
did
not
converse
with
miss
bush
but
he
never
lost
the
consciousness
of
her
presence
and
was
almost
annoyedly
aware
of
a
youngish
man
evident
appreciation
of
her
conversation
so
that
his
temper
when
he
found
himself
in
lady
garribardine
was
even
more
peevish
than
it
had
been
on
the
evening
before
katherine
had
preceded
him
there
but
had
left
ere
he
arrived
she
had
brought
some
letters
for
her
mistress
inspection
when
this
business
was
finished
she
said
quite
simply
his
grace
came
up
into
the
schoolroom
after
luncheon
he
appears
to
have
been
confused
over
my
two
identities
i
explained
to
him
and
told
him
who
my
father
was
and
my
mother
father
and
how
i
have
only
tried
to
make
myself
into
a
lady
it
did
not
seem
fair
that
he
should
think
that
i
was
really
one
born
lady
garribardine
looked
disagreeable
for
an
instant
she
too
had
to
conquer
instinct
at
times
which
asserted
itself
in
opposition
even
to
her
heart
desire
and
her
deliberate
intentions
one
of
her
ancestors
had
put
a
retainer
in
chains
for
presumption
but
her
intelligence
crushed
out
the
folly
almost
as
quickly
as
it
arose
and
she
smiled
and
of
course
the
duke
at
once
said
he
could
not
know
common
people
and
bounced
from
the
room
katherine
bush
you
are
a
minx
my
child
katherine
laughed
softly
he
did
not
say
that
exactly
but
he
did
go
away
very
soon
that
fights
and
runs
away
quoth
her
ladyship
but
i
do
think
you
had
better
let
him
come
to
the
schoolroom
again
martha
will
be
having
her
say
about
the
matter
katherine
reddened
that
her
dear
mistress
should
think
her
so
stupid
i
did
not
intend
to
it
is
very
difficult
even
the
greatest
gentlemen
do
not
seem
to
know
their
places
always
a
man
finds
his
place
near
the
woman
he
wants
to
talk
to
you
must
not
forget
that
girl
it
is
a
little
mean
and
puts
the
woman
in
a
false
position
often
she
prefers
that
to
indifference
there
is
one
very
curious
thing
about
women
the
greatest
prude
is
not
altogether
inwardly
displeased
at
the
knowledge
that
she
exercises
a
physical
attraction
for
men
just
as
the
greatest
intellectual
among
men
feels
more
flattered
if
exceptional
virility
is
imputed
to
him
than
all
the
spiritual
gifts
virility
a
quality
which
he
shares
with
the
lower
animals
spirituality
a
gift
which
he
inherits
from
god
oh
we
are
a
mass
of
incongruities
we
humans
and
brutal
nature
eventually
wins
the
game
animal
savagery
is
always
the
outcome
of
too
much
civilisation
and
unless
the
dark
ages
of
ignorance
fall
upon
us
once
more
so
that
we
can
again
be
sufficiently
simple
to
believe
in
a
god
i
feel
our
cycle
is
over
and
that
we
shall
be
burnt
out
of
time
then
presently
as
her
secretary
was
moving
towards
the
door
her
ladyship
remarked
irrelevantly
look
here
girl
do
you
think
it
is
in
your
nature
ever
to
love
really
or
are
you
going
to
let
brain
conquer
always
i
do
not
know
faltered
katherine
love
is
the
only
thing
on
earth
which
is
sublime
this
evening
until
you
come
down
after
dinner
i
recommend
you
to
read
the
of
abelard
and
heloise
the
duke
talked
of
politics
for
a
while
when
he
came
into
his
old
and
then
of
books
and
ideas
and
lastly
of
gerard
was
he
happy
with
beatrice
after
all
yes
they
do
very
well
together
beatrice
is
bred
out
of
all
natural
emotions
she
is
sexless
and
and
unconsciously
humorous
they
go
their
own
ways
but
gerard
was
always
an
ardent
lover
has
he
had
no
emotions
since
the
alice
southerwood
days
a
transient
passion
for
l√§o
delemar
and
since
then
a
deep
devotion
elsewhere
quite
unreturned
though
it
has
rather
improved
him
the
duke
unconsciously
felt
relief
unreturned
that
must
be
a
new
experience
for
him
gerard
has
every
quality
to
attract
a
woman
this
one
is
infinitely
too
proud
and
too
intelligent
to
waste
a
thought
upon
a
married
man
it
is
a
girl
then
how
unlike
gerard
usual
taste
yes
mordryn
shall
you
open
valfreyne
quite
soon
immediately
i
shall
have
a
party
for
whitsuntide
if
you
will
honour
me
by
acting
hostess
all
right
if
i
may
bring
my
with
me
a
large
order
i
ca
stand
the
racket
without
stirling
and
james
and
harmon
my
chauffeur
and
miss
bush
all
are
perfectly
welcome
especially
miss
bush
she
appeared
an
extremely
clever
girl
when
i
had
the
pleasure
of
talking
to
her
yes
she
is
a
wonderful
creature
i
am
thinking
of
marrying
her
off
to
sir
john
townly
the
duke
leaned
forward
his
voice
was
quite
shocked
how
inhuman
seraphim
john
townly
must
be
sixty
at
least
my
dear
mordryn
that
is
only
seven
years
older
than
you
are
and
i
look
upon
you
as
hardly
yet
at
the
prime
of
life
and
beggars
can
not
be
choosers
the
girl
is
of
no
family
neither
for
that
matter
is
sir
john
it
will
be
suitable
in
every
way
i
suppose
you
will
let
me
have
a
say
as
to
the
guests
for
the
whitsuntide
outbreak
eh
naturally
but
spare
me
any
too
overmodern
widows
or
any
further
breakers
in
of
my
sensibilities
seraphim
laughed
and
they
set
about
making
the
list
but
when
the
duke
had
gone
to
dress
she
looked
long
into
the
fire
something
a
little
sentimental
and
yet
satisfied
in
her
gaze
dear
mordryn
gerard
and
the
caused
him
uneasiness
it
would
not
have
done
for
that
to
continue
because
of
the
unpleasant
reflection
that
is
a
married
man
sir
john
was
splendid
but
mordryn
is
no
fool
i
must
now
really
oppose
him
in
every
possible
way
i
am
not
sure
if
after
all
i
shall
take
her
to
valfreyne
and
the
duke
as
he
dressed
said
to
himself
that
he
did
not
understand
women
here
was
seraphim
a
creature
with
the
kindest
heart
yet
so
full
of
that
distressingly
feminine
matchmaking
instinct
which
was
the
curse
of
her
sex
that
she
was
ready
to
pitchfork
this
charming
living
fascinating
young
person
into
the
mouldering
arms
of
old
john
townly
the
idea
was
simply
revolting
to
contemplate
even
if
beggars
could
not
be
choosers
and
then
suddenly
he
seemed
to
see
the
auctioneer
father
and
the
butcher
grandfather
and
the
home
at
bindon
green
he
walked
down
to
dinner
in
a
subdued
mood
chapter
xxvii
on
easter
sunday
in
church
katherine
sat
in
the
overflow
pew
and
so
could
be
looked
at
by
those
highly
placed
in
the
chancel
seat
of
honour
without
the
least
turning
of
their
heads
it
was
not
surprising
then
that
the
duke
found
the
sermon
a
very
good
and
a
very
short
one
as
his
thoughts
ran
on
just
as
gerard
strobridge
had
done
in
that
same
church
once
before
what
a
charming
oval
face
the
girl
had
and
how
purely
white
was
her
skin
what
was
she
thinking
about
with
that
inscrutable
expression
the
mouth
was
so
firm
and
so
was
the
chin
full
red
lips
which
were
yet
firm
were
dangerous
things
her
air
was
very
distinguished
and
her
garments
showed
great
taste
the
whole
thing
was
incredible
of
course
there
must
be
some
harking
back
to
gentle
blood
not
one
of
the
party
looked
so
like
his
ideal
of
a
lady
as
she
and
she
had
spoken
too
of
love
she
had
admitted
that
she
knew
of
one
side
of
it
what
were
her
words
it
makes
one
feel
mad
agitated
unbalanced
animal
even
motherly
and
protective
but
what
it
could
be
if
it
touched
the
soul
she
could
not
fathom
well
the
phase
which
she
did
know
was
not
without
its
charm
what
extraordinary
alluring
eyes
she
had
who
could
the
fellow
have
been
not
a
person
from
er
green
of
course
she
must
always
have
been
too
refined
for
that
and
not
gerard
a
woman
who
had
once
felt
those
emotions
for
a
man
did
not
look
at
him
with
that
serene
calm
with
which
miss
bush
had
looked
at
gerard
what
a
most
damnably
exasperating
circumstance
it
was
that
she
was
not
a
guest
and
that
he
could
not
spend
the
afternoon
discussing
love
and
its
aspects
while
pacing
that
sunny
walk
in
the
walled
garden
safe
from
the
east
wind
how
beautifully
her
hair
grew
the
brow
was
queenly
how
well
it
would
look
with
an
crown
of
diamonds
surmounting
it
sir
john
would
probably
give
her
something
of
the
sort
these
rich
parvenus
people
with
but
a
grandfather
perhaps
would
buy
some
flashy
modern
thing
that
kind
of
head
would
do
justice
to
family
jewels
he
knew
of
one
particular
crown
which
had
belonged
to
a
certain
duchess
of
early
regency
days
which
was
reposing
now
at
garrards
and
which
would
be
specially
becoming
italy
she
had
spoken
of
italy
she
had
never
been
there
what
a
companion
to
take
to
italy
she
grasped
the
spirit
of
countries
how
she
had
understood
eothen
but
the
people
were
rising
the
sermon
was
over
capital
fellow
woolman
his
sermons
were
much
shorter
though
than
they
used
to
be
would
she
walk
back
across
the
park
yes
of
course
and
he
would
have
to
motor
what
contemptible
slaves
civilisation
made
of
people
as
everyone
was
assembled
in
the
hall
on
the
way
to
luncheon
the
exasperated
duke
came
over
to
katherine
can
i
find
shelter
in
the
peaceful
backwater
again
this
afternoon
miss
bush
it
is
a
vile
day
you
see
and
no
tennis
is
possible
no
i
am
afraid
not
does
that
mean
no
tennis
or
no
backwater
both
why
the
schoolroom
is
not
intended
for
visitors
and
sunday
afternoon
is
the
only
time
in
which
i
can
sit
in
the
armchair
myself
and
read
i
would
not
take
more
than
the
edge
of
the
table
if
you
would
let
me
come
eagerly
and
we
could
talk
over
what
you
are
reading
katherine
looked
at
him
and
there
was
reproach
in
her
eyes
your
grace
must
know
that
it
is
altogether
impossible
for
you
to
come
to
the
schoolroom
it
could
but
bring
censure
upon
me
is
it
quite
kind
he
was
contrite
in
a
moment
forgive
me
i
see
my
suggestion
was
not
chivalrous
forgive
me
a
thousand
times
she
moved
on
with
the
general
company
without
answering
and
it
chanced
at
luncheon
that
the
duke
could
see
her
face
and
it
looked
to
him
rather
sad
he
felt
a
number
of
things
and
even
though
it
rained
he
went
for
a
walk
in
the
early
afternoon
alone
there
was
obviously
only
one
post
which
a
woman
in
her
position
in
life
could
fill
in
regard
to
a
man
in
his
but
every
fine
sentiment
in
him
revolted
at
the
picture
of
it
that
proud
head
could
never
bow
to
the
status
of
mistress
he
must
dismiss
such
vagrant
thoughts
he
must
dismiss
all
thoughts
of
her
except
that
she
was
a
pleasant
companion
when
chance
allowed
him
to
be
naturally
in
her
society
for
a
minute
now
and
then
there
were
so
many
other
interests
in
his
homecoming
which
he
must
think
of
his
public
duties
which
the
tragic
circumstances
of
his
life
had
forced
him
to
waive
for
so
long
there
were
politics
too
the
renovation
of
the
london
house
the
plans
for
the
season
the
reopening
of
valfreyne
by
the
way
which
rooms
should
he
give
to
seraphim
and
her
secretary
for
whitsuntide
the
venetian
suite
on
the
ground
floor
in
the
west
wing
seraphim
should
have
the
bedroom
and
and
which
looked
on
to
the
park
and
miss
bush
the
smaller
bedroom
hung
with
green
damask
adjoining
and
how
would
things
be
she
would
be
his
guest
then
and
should
be
treated
with
all
honour
there
should
be
no
more
coming
into
the
after
dinner
and
lunching
if
the
numbers
had
to
be
made
up
but
to
what
end
this
was
ridiculous
weakness
this
allowing
his
thoughts
to
dwell
upon
her
so
much
he
had
better
go
back
to
the
house
and
talk
to
one
of
the
newcomers
quite
a
nice
woman
who
was
not
intent
upon
falling
into
his
arms
and
katherine
sat
in
the
schoolroom
for
a
little
but
she
did
not
read
she
had
seen
the
duke
from
the
window
for
an
instant
passing
the
end
of
the
rose
garden
the
sight
of
him
had
made
her
sit
down
in
her
armchair
and
begin
to
think
could
the
barrier
of
the
enormous
difference
in
their
positions
ever
be
surmounted
after
all
dukes
had
married
even
actresses
in
the
past
but
she
would
never
accept
such
a
position
as
had
been
the
lot
of
such
duchesses
she
must
only
wear
the
strawberry
leaves
if
they
could
be
given
her
in
all
honour
and
with
the
sympathy
and
the
approval
of
her
own
immediate
world
it
almost
looked
as
though
her
acquiescence
would
be
forthcoming
but
there
was
yet
another
side
of
the
question
there
was
the
recollection
of
the
three
days
with
lord
algy
no
faintest
uneasiness
or
regret
about
that
episode
had
ever
entered
her
brain
during
all
her
friendship
with
gerard
except
on
that
one
evening
after
hearing
of
the
misfortune
of
gladys
and
upon
that
one
occasion
when
first
she
had
again
seen
the
hotel
in
paris
now
she
was
faced
with
the
thought
what
would
the
duke
say
if
he
knew
of
this
circumstance
in
her
life
with
his
lofty
point
of
view
his
pride
and
his
present
great
respect
for
her
the
knowledge
would
inevitably
part
them
and
if
he
should
remain
in
ignorance
and
marry
her
the
secret
fear
of
his
ever
discovering
the
truth
afterwards
would
hang
like
damocles
sword
over
her
head
it
would
insidiously
and
inevitably
destroy
the
harmony
and
perfect
balance
of
her
mind
necessary
for
her
to
carry
through
the
great
task
of
playing
successfully
the
part
of
duchess
and
it
would
eventually
spoil
her
whole
life
she
more
than
ever
realised
the
certain
reaction
of
every
single
action
committed
and
of
every
thought
thought
therefore
the
tremendous
necessity
of
forethought
unless
the
mind
is
perfectly
at
peace
with
itself
she
knew
it
could
never
have
magnetic
force
to
propel
its
desires
and
must
lose
confidence
and
so
fail
to
reach
its
goal
this
she
realised
fully
her
particular
type
and
logical
brain
weighing
all
matters
without
sentiment
totally
uninfluenced
by
orthodox
ideas
as
to
morality
if
such
orthodox
ideas
did
not
seem
to
be
supported
by
common
sense
caused
her
to
feel
no
guilt
nor
any
conscience
prickings
on
having
taken
lord
algy
as
a
lover
they
had
both
been
free
and
were
injuring
none
to
her
it
appeared
no
sin
merely
that
such
actions
not
being
sanctioned
by
custom
would
inevitably
draw
upon
those
who
committed
them
the
penalty
attached
to
breaking
any
laws
even
should
they
be
only
those
of
conventionality
but
beyond
all
this
there
was
another
and
quite
newly
experienced
emotion
troubling
her
it
had
arisen
sharply
and
suddenly
in
her
breast
born
of
that
strange
thrill
she
had
felt
when
the
duke
had
kissed
her
hand
what
if
he
the
man
himself
should
grow
to
matter
to
her
matter
as
algy
had
done
quite
apart
from
his
dukedom
and
his
being
the
medium
through
which
she
could
gratify
her
ambitions
what
a
unique
subtle
extraordinary
emotion
she
had
experienced
she
must
keep
her
head
she
must
not
give
way
to
such
things
how
hateful
how
unbearable
it
would
be
if
one
day
she
should
see
disgust
and
contempt
in
those
eyes
instead
of
the
look
of
homage
which
had
preceded
the
kiss
then
she
scolded
herself
to
fear
was
to
draw
inevitably
the
thing
feared
she
must
have
no
fears
and
no
regrets
she
must
pursue
her
plan
with
intelligence
and
if
the
feeling
that
she
was
using
deception
grew
to
be
insupportable
then
she
must
have
courage
to
face
the
result
of
her
own
past
action
and
she
must
admit
herself
beaten
and
retire
from
the
game
she
went
over
the
chances
of
discovery
lord
algy
would
never
give
her
away
she
had
calculated
upon
that
fact
when
she
had
chosen
an
aristocrat
for
her
partner
in
initiation
there
remained
only
the
valet
hanson
who
had
seen
her
often
enough
possibly
to
recognise
her
again
but
he
did
not
know
her
real
name
and
had
shown
no
interest
in
her
too
accustomed
probably
to
the
changes
in
his
master
fancies
to
remark
upon
individuals
also
she
was
so
completely
altered
since
those
days
no
casual
remembrance
hanson
might
have
kept
of
her
would
be
likely
to
revive
if
he
chanced
to
see
her
now
the
odds
were
ten
thousand
to
one
that
neither
the
duke
nor
anyone
else
would
ever
know
of
her
adventure
it
thus
resolved
itself
only
into
a
question
for
her
own
honest
soul
to
decide
the
common
sense
way
to
look
at
everything
was
that
the
time
for
these
was
not
yet
and
that
her
energies
must
be
concentrated
upon
continuing
to
profit
by
the
results
of
her
first
sensible
action
in
making
the
impression
upon
the
duke
imagination
unbiased
by
class
prejudices
so
presently
she
grew
quieter
and
at
last
fell
asleep
over
the
wood
fire
the
volume
of
the
letters
of
abelard
and
h√©loise
still
in
her
hand
she
was
awakened
after
a
while
by
the
entrance
of
lady
garribardine
and
quickly
rose
from
her
seat
i
am
sorry
to
disturb
your
sunday
peace
miss
bush
but
some
of
the
guests
are
growing
restive
with
the
wet
go
and
take
charge
of
those
in
the
and
accompany
their
songs
i
do
think
this
party
has
been
well
chosen
the
elements
do
not
assimilate
katherine
was
laboriously
doing
her
duty
when
the
duke
came
in
he
did
not
attempt
to
come
near
her
but
stayed
by
the
great
centre
fireplace
talking
to
one
of
the
newcomers
without
his
usual
air
of
making
a
virtue
of
necessity
which
his
attitude
towards
the
three
charmers
had
hitherto
suggested
to
katherine
she
could
get
a
good
view
of
him
from
the
piano
and
found
her
eye
greatly
pleased
he
was
certainly
very
attractive
he
had
that
same
humorous
and
rather
cynical
expression
which
so
often
distinguished
her
mistress
his
figure
was
so
perfect
and
his
clothes
with
their
air
of
a
bygone
day
for
a
second
katherine
hand
seemed
to
tingle
again
in
the
place
which
he
had
kissed
and
she
experienced
that
nameless
thrill
which
is
half
quiver
and
half
shock
she
felt
that
she
hated
having
to
play
the
accompaniments
and
resented
her
position
it
gave
her
some
relief
to
crash
loud
chords
none
of
the
younger
men
could
approach
the
duke
in
charm
what
was
he
talking
to
that
woman
about
interesting
books
some
of
their
mutual
friends
perhaps
she
wished
she
could
hear
but
she
could
not
his
voice
was
lazy
again
she
caught
its
tones
now
and
then
but
not
the
words
and
the
firelight
made
his
emerald
ring
sparkle
she
wondered
if
there
was
some
history
connected
with
it
it
was
so
large
and
so
unusual
a
signet
for
a
man
to
wear
how
exquisite
it
would
have
been
to
have
been
able
to
have
let
him
come
up
to
the
schoolroom
then
she
could
have
asked
him
about
it
perhaps
she
sighed
unconsciously
and
presently
they
all
went
in
to
tea
there
was
some
inscrutable
expression
in
her
eyes
as
they
met
his
in
handing
him
his
cup
they
were
a
little
shadowed
and
sorrowful
they
drew
him
like
a
magnet
so
that
desire
made
him
at
last
use
sophistry
in
his
arguments
with
himself
what
harm
could
there
be
in
a
little
casual
conversation
and
he
took
a
seat
near
had
you
profitable
repose
this
afternoon
in
your
armchair
miss
bush
yes
i
hope
so
i
was
sorting
things
and
getting
them
into
their
niches
in
my
mind
i
hope
you
had
not
too
wet
a
walk
i
saw
you
from
the
window
passing
the
end
of
the
rose
garden
i
wish
you
had
come
out
the
air
was
fresh
and
it
is
rather
nice
to
have
the
wet
in
one
face
at
times
so
you
put
everything
into
niches
in
your
mind
was
it
in
chaos
before
then
yes
partly
what
has
caused
this
upset
that
and
there
was
a
peculiar
tone
in
her
voice
i
should
much
like
to
know
we
seem
to
come
to
new
vistas
in
life
do
we
not
when
everything
must
be
looked
at
in
a
fresh
perspective
that
is
very
true
and
then
we
must
call
up
all
our
sense
of
balance
to
grasp
the
new
outlines
accurately
and
not
to
be
led
away
into
false
conceptions
through
emotion
the
duke
was
greatly
interested
how
exactly
she
was
describing
his
own
state
of
mind
but
what
had
caused
such
thoughts
to
arise
in
hers
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
see
things
as
they
are
when
emotion
enters
into
the
question
he
said
and
how
dull
everything
appears
when
it
does
not
she
looked
at
him
and
there
were
rebellion
and
suppressed
passion
in
her
compelling
eyes
and
the
duke
pulses
suddenly
began
to
bound
but
this
was
the
sole
exchange
of
sentences
they
were
vouchsafed
for
blanche
montague
subsided
into
a
sofa
close
to
his
side
and
beamed
at
him
with
a
whispered
challenge
so
katherine
turned
and
devoted
herself
to
some
other
guests
beyond
she
did
not
come
into
the
again
that
night
she
asked
her
mistress
if
she
might
be
excused
for
if
not
really
wanted
there
were
numbers
of
letters
to
write
and
mordryn
looked
for
her
in
vain
and
eventually
manoeuvred
the
conversation
round
to
the
reason
for
her
absence
when
speaking
to
old
gwendoline
who
he
had
perceived
was
devoted
to
the
girl
i
think
she
must
be
tired
having
asked
sarah
to
excuse
her
i
do
remember
her
ever
to
have
done
such
a
thing
before
she
is
such
a
dear
child
i
do
know
what
sarah
would
do
without
her
we
are
all
very
fond
of
her
a
perfect
lady
wherever
she
came
from
but
i
really
do
not
care
from
where
of
course
not
cordially
responded
the
duke
and
he
wondered
what
had
made
her
tired
and
why
her
eyes
had
been
rebellious
and
sad
was
she
wounded
because
he
had
suggested
coming
to
the
schoolroom
with
the
risk
of
drawing
down
censure
upon
her
head
she
needed
some
explanation
certainly
from
him
he
felt
upon
this
matter
it
had
been
thoughtless
on
his
part
and
not
really
kind
he
would
not
leave
after
all
why
should
not
gwendoline
who
was
stupid
and
be
used
to
further
his
plans
if
the
chance
to
see
miss
bush
looked
too
impossibly
difficult
of
attainment
but
he
went
to
bed
with
no
sense
of
happiness
or
satisfaction
in
his
heart
he
liked
rising
early
and
escaped
to
the
rose
garden
alone
about
nine
on
easter
monday
morning
no
windows
but
those
of
the
wing
and
those
of
the
picture
gallery
and
the
main
hall
looked
out
upon
this
secluded
spot
he
had
walked
to
the
end
when
he
saw
in
the
distance
at
a
turn
in
the
shrubbery
the
figure
of
katherine
disappearing
towards
the
park
this
was
luck
indeed
he
hurried
after
her
and
overtook
her
as
she
opened
the
shrubbery
gate
she
carried
a
basket
of
fresh
eggs
and
a
black
bottle
whither
away
mistress
he
asked
as
he
raised
his
cap
and
walked
by
her
side
i
am
going
to
take
these
to
old
peterson
at
the
far
lodge
she
has
not
been
well
these
last
days
jacob
wife
yes
then
may
i
come
too
i
must
have
some
exercise
look
upon
it
like
that
since
i
strongly
suspect
if
i
told
you
that
it
was
simply
for
the
pleasure
of
being
with
you
you
would
send
me
back
i
should
not
want
to
but
i
suppose
i
should
have
to
say
that
she
was
looking
very
pretty
in
her
rough
homespun
suit
and
green
felt
hat
the
wind
had
blown
no
colour
as
yet
into
her
cheeks
but
had
made
her
little
ears
almost
a
scarlet
pink
she
seemed
the
embodiment
of
sensuous
youth
and
health
and
life
her
type
was
so
far
from
being
ascetic
what
ever
the
mental
gifts
might
be
nature
would
have
a
strong
say
in
everything
concerning
her
the
duke
admired
her
supple
slender
limbs
and
he
reflected
just
as
gerard
had
done
long
before
how
very
stately
she
would
become
presently
if
she
married
and
had
children
sir
john
but
he
banished
sir
john
shall
we
forget
all
those
stupid
conventions
on
this
wild
march
morning
and
return
to
the
stage
in
our
acquaintance
at
which
we
were
when
we
said
at
gerard
strobridge
that
would
be
nice
is
it
a
bargain
then
yes
i
am
not
to
be
grace
and
you
are
not
to
remind
me
every
two
minutes
that
you
are
lady
garribardine
secretary
very
well
if
you
remember
the
last
words
we
had
together
then
were
finished
by
a
question
from
you
to
me
as
to
whether
there
was
not
something
else
in
love
beyond
that
passionate
side
which
you
intimated
that
you
already
knew
yes
i
remember
i
think
there
is
a
great
deal
more
but
it
would
not
be
complete
alone
love
to
be
lasting
must
be
a
mixture
of
both
passion
and
idealism
but
where
can
one
find
such
a
combination
in
these
days
the
emotion
which
most
people
call
love
is
composed
of
and
a
little
transitory
exaltation
of
the
senses
but
such
and
divine
qualities
as
devotion
and
tenderness
and
are
almost
unknown
katherine
did
not
speak
the
letters
of
abelard
and
h√©loise
were
very
fresh
in
her
memory
one
passage
in
first
letter
had
struck
her
forcibly
if
there
is
anything
that
may
properly
be
called
happiness
here
below
i
am
persuaded
it
is
in
the
union
of
two
persons
who
love
each
other
with
perfect
liberty
who
are
united
by
a
secret
inclination
and
satisfied
with
each
other
merits
their
hearts
are
full
of
love
and
leave
no
vacancy
for
any
other
passion
they
enjoy
perpetual
tranquillity
because
they
enjoy
content
and
now
with
sudden
illumination
of
the
spirit
the
conviction
came
to
her
that
this
was
the
truth
and
that
this
man
walking
by
her
side
talking
in
his
exquisite
voice
to
her
looking
at
her
with
his
deep
blue
eyes
could
inspire
in
her
all
the
passion
and
all
the
devotion
and
all
the
tenderness
which
had
felt
of
old
and
the
magnitude
of
the
discovery
kept
her
silent
with
lowered
lids
he
waited
for
her
to
speak
but
when
no
words
came
he
bent
forward
and
looked
into
her
face
the
eyes
which
at
last
met
his
were
troubled
and
sweet
and
not
in
their
proud
serenity
as
usual
do
not
let
us
talk
about
love
she
said
at
last
it
is
a
moving
theme
and
better
left
alone
yesterday
i
was
reading
the
of
abelard
and
h√©loise
and
it
is
wiser
to
remember
the
wisdom
in
this
phrase
of
than
to
talk
of
love
great
advantages
would
philosophy
give
us
over
other
men
if
by
studying
it
we
could
learn
to
govern
our
passions
mordryn
smiled
finish
the
quotation
he
commanded
or
shall
i
efforts
what
relapses
what
agitations
do
we
undergo
and
how
long
are
we
tossed
in
this
confusion
unable
to
exert
our
reason
to
possess
our
souls
or
to
rule
our
affections
what
a
troublesome
employment
is
love
philosophers
remember
as
a
great
scholar
and
ethical
teacher
but
he
lives
not
by
his
learning
or
his
philosophy
but
by
the
memory
of
his
profound
and
passionate
love
katherine
sighed
i
suppose
it
is
indeed
divine
but
please
do
not
let
us
talk
of
it
it
makes
everyday
life
grey
and
commonplace
by
contrast
the
duke
was
sufficiently
master
of
himself
to
realise
that
it
was
wiser
to
take
her
advice
to
discuss
love
on
a
march
morning
with
this
most
attractive
and
forbidden
young
woman
was
not
wisdom
so
he
changed
the
subject
by
expressing
his
contrition
at
having
come
to
the
schoolroom
he
hated
to
think
that
his
chivalry
had
been
at
fault
then
they
talked
of
many
things
all
in
the
abstract
evolution
and
ethics
and
aspirations
and
theories
and
at
last
katherine
said
how
glorious
to
be
you
to
have
all
that
is
noble
your
own
by
right
and
so
to
have
leisure
to
let
your
soul
expand
to
the
highest
without
wasting
it
in
the
struggle
to
emerge
from
clay
her
deep
voice
had
a
passion
in
it
and
her
eyes
flashed
you
and
all
aristocrats
should
be
grateful
to
god
later
in
the
day
mordryn
felt
that
it
was
fortunate
that
at
this
particular
moment
they
had
reached
the
gate
of
the
far
lodge
the
opening
of
which
broke
the
spell
of
what
he
might
have
answered
he
did
not
feel
altogether
sure
so
deeply
had
she
affected
him
peterson
was
a
good
deal
better
it
seemed
and
katherine
proposed
to
stay
with
her
for
half
an
hour
so
she
came
out
of
the
door
and
asked
the
duke
not
to
wait
for
her
go
back
without
me
i
have
been
so
happy
and
please
do
not
talk
to
me
any
more
and
oh
please
remember
who
you
are
and
who
i
am
and
leave
me
alone
and
to
his
intense
surprise
and
sudden
unhinging
her
fearless
glance
was
softened
by
a
mist
which
might
have
presaged
tears
chapter
xxviii
mordryn
spent
a
most
unrestful
day
he
found
it
very
difficult
to
settle
to
anything
he
felt
it
wiser
whenever
his
thoughts
turned
to
katherine
bush
immediately
to
picture
bindon
green
and
the
auctioneer
father
and
butcher
grandfather
they
acted
as
a
kind
of
antidote
to
the
very
powerful
intoxicant
which
was
flooding
his
veins
and
katherine
sat
typing
mechanically
her
morning
work
but
some
third
sense
beyond
eye
and
hand
was
busy
with
agitating
thoughts
no
she
could
play
no
further
game
with
the
duke
fate
had
beaten
her
it
would
be
no
acting
she
knew
that
she
was
just
a
woman
after
all
and
he
was
a
man
and
the
dukedom
had
gone
into
shadowland
he
possessed
everything
that
algy
had
lacked
there
would
be
no
blank
when
passion
was
lulled
with
him
his
perfectly
cultivated
intellect
could
enchant
her
always
she
adored
his
point
of
view
as
unconsciously
arrogant
as
lady
garribardine
and
yet
as
free
and
expanded
how
she
could
soar
with
him
to
guide
her
what
happiness
to
take
refuge
from
everything
in
his
arms
he
did
not
seem
old
to
her
indeed
except
for
his
thick
hair
and
the
expression
of
having
greatly
suffered
which
now
and
then
showed
in
his
proud
eyes
there
were
no
unlovely
signs
of
age
about
him
he
could
still
call
forth
for
many
years
the
passionate
love
of
women
and
what
was
age
a
ridiculous
phantasy
the
soul
was
the
thing
katherine
was
beginning
to
believe
that
she
herself
had
a
soul
and
that
otto
weininger
was
altogether
wrong
about
individuals
even
if
his
deductions
were
correct
concerning
the
majority
of
women
several
guardsmen
from
windsor
came
over
to
luncheon
which
was
so
crowded
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
katherine
to
go
down
and
tea
came
before
she
again
saw
the
duke
he
deliberately
allowed
himself
to
be
entrapped
by
one
of
the
trio
of
graces
and
did
not
come
near
her
and
when
katherine
got
into
the
after
dinner
he
was
nowhere
in
sight
a
cabinet
minister
one
of
the
few
her
ladyship
considered
sufficiently
worthy
to
be
allowed
to
visit
blissington
had
arrived
in
the
afternoon
and
the
duke
and
the
hostess
and
another
man
and
woman
made
a
group
in
the
small
red
in
earnest
converse
while
most
of
the
rest
of
the
company
danced
in
the
hall
and
katherine
went
among
these
and
presently
she
slipped
up
to
her
old
schoolroom
his
grace
was
carrying
out
her
request
it
appeared
but
therein
she
found
no
joy
and
later
mordryn
drank
his
final
hock
and
seltzer
in
his
old
boudoir
where
they
had
a
little
talk
together
alone
it
has
been
dear
of
you
to
stay
so
long
mordryn
she
told
him
especially
as
the
diversions
which
i
hoped
i
had
provided
for
you
turned
out
of
no
more
use
than
a
plague
of
gnats
i
hope
you
have
not
been
too
bored
i
am
never
bored
with
you
dear
friend
no
i
know
that
but
in
a
big
party
i
can
not
give
you
as
much
time
as
i
should
like
you
will
come
again
when
we
are
quiet
though
just
as
you
always
used
to
and
i
will
really
find
you
a
suitable
bride
the
duke
was
in
a
cynical
mood
it
seemed
for
he
treated
this
proposal
not
at
all
in
the
light
fashion
he
had
done
at
the
beginning
of
the
visit
he
replied
gloomily
that
he
had
decided
to
select
something
steady
and
plain
if
he
must
marry
he
knew
he
could
never
care
for
a
woman
again
and
a
healthy
quiet
creature
with
tact
who
would
leave
him
alone
was
all
he
asked
life
was
a
hideous
disappointment
and
very
difficult
to
understand
and
to
try
to
do
one
duty
to
one
state
and
get
through
with
it
was
all
that
anyone
could
hope
to
accomplish
but
to
this
her
ladyship
said
a
vigorous
tut
tut
you
speak
like
a
boy
crossed
in
love
mordryn
if
you
were
you
could
not
have
a
more
delightful
vista
opening
out
in
front
of
you
jeunesse
savait
si
vieillesse
that
was
cried
from
a
wise
and
envious
heart
well
you
both
and
so
what
more
could
a
man
ask
of
fate
i
have
no
patience
with
you
i
do
want
you
now
only
to
do
your
duty
to
fulfil
the
obligations
of
your
station
you
have
always
done
so
your
life
has
been
one
long
carrying
out
of
i
want
you
to
kick
over
the
traces
and
be
happy
mordryn
ridiculously
boyishly
happy
do
you
hear
conscientious
martyr
mordryn
heard
but
his
smile
was
still
bitter
as
he
answered
we
are
not
so
made
seraphim
neither
you
nor
i
we
could
not
do
as
you
say
even
when
we
were
young
and
tradition
and
obligation
to
our
order
will
still
dominate
us
to
the
end
of
time
dear
friend
then
he
said
and
for
he
was
leaving
at
for
a
place
of
his
in
the
north
when
lady
garribardine
was
alone
she
did
not
look
at
all
disturbed
at
the
passage
of
events
as
she
reviewed
her
easter
party
she
smiled
happily
in
fact
and
decided
that
she
would
take
her
secretary
to
valfreyne
for
whitsuntide
after
all
man
proposed
but
she
reflected
sagely
god
often
disposed
in
favour
of
intelligent
women
in
the
following
week
the
establishment
from
blissington
moved
up
to
berkeley
square
for
the
season
and
katherine
duties
became
heavy
again
her
first
meeting
with
gerard
strobridge
happened
quite
soon
he
came
into
the
secretary
room
from
the
library
after
luncheon
now
tell
me
all
about
everything
he
said
i
have
gathered
from
gwendoline
that
you
came
down
every
night
and
had
your
usual
success
at
the
easter
party
and
that
mordryn
evidently
liked
you
for
he
told
gwen
that
you
were
the
most
intelligent
girl
that
he
had
ever
met
katherine
half
smiled
a
little
sadly
yes
he
may
have
thought
so
but
eventually
the
secretary
swallowed
up
the
guest
i
do
not
know
if
he
will
ever
speak
to
me
again
he
felt
as
badly
as
that
did
he
poor
mordryn
no
doubt
you
tormented
him
but
mordryn
is
no
weak
creature
like
me
if
he
feels
very
much
about
you
he
will
either
defy
convention
or
break
away
from
all
temptation
then
his
voice
changed
and
he
asked
a
little
anxiously
katherine
do
you
begin
to
care
for
him
yes
how
much
i
do
not
know
i
could
care
a
great
deal
he
pleases
me
in
every
way
i
love
his
looks
and
his
mind
and
he
he
makes
me
feel
something
which
i
have
never
felt
before
is
it
the
capability
for
devotion
i
do
not
know
for
the
first
time
in
their
acquaintance
strobridge
saw
her
undecided
gentle
a
little
helpless
even
it
touched
him
deeply
he
loved
her
so
very
dearly
he
would
rather
see
her
happy
if
he
could
aid
her
to
become
so
he
came
over
to
her
and
leaned
upon
the
table
dearest
girl
everything
is
a
sickening
jumble
in
this
world
it
seems
i
have
a
kind
of
premonition
though
that
you
will
emerge
triumphant
however
it
goes
but
after
katherine
i
shall
not
see
you
until
late
in
the
autumn
i
am
going
away
to
russia
this
time
and
i
am
going
to
try
once
more
not
to
care
so
even
her
one
friend
would
be
far
from
her
well
she
must
not
lose
her
nerve
she
gave
him
her
blessing
for
his
journey
and
they
said
and
the
days
went
on
apace
matilda
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
charlie
prodgers
and
was
full
of
importance
and
glee
and
had
drifted
further
and
further
away
from
her
sister
ever
since
the
engagement
was
announced
some
instinctive
feminine
jealousy
made
her
feel
that
she
would
prefer
katherine
to
be
as
far
as
possible
from
her
fianc√©
after
all
kitten
she
said
when
they
met
in
the
park
to
discuss
the
news
you
are
one
of
us
and
we
are
one
of
you
i
shall
be
moving
up
now
into
mabel
set
and
there
is
no
use
in
hiding
it
mabel
seem
to
dote
on
you
yes
i
feel
that
agreed
katherine
meekly
lowering
her
eyes
so
that
her
sister
might
not
see
their
twinkle
i
expect
we
shall
not
meet
often
in
the
future
tild
well
of
course
kitten
i
always
be
very
pleased
to
have
tea
with
you
up
here
now
and
then
and
matilda
gave
an
uncomfortable
laugh
but
it
is
always
best
to
avoid
awkwardness
is
it
dearie
and
you
are
only
a
paid
servant
are
you
living
in
not
like
you
were
at
liv
and
dev
out
on
your
own
and
everyone
starts
better
in
considering
her
husband
position
do
they
and
charlie
is
manager
in
his
department
now
and
very
particular
as
to
who
i
know
you
are
perfectly
right
tild
katherine
voice
was
ominously
soft
and
so
is
charlie
you
go
ahead
and
very
soon
you
will
have
got
above
mabel
and
of
course
i
would
not
be
a
drag
on
you
for
the
world
i
think
after
we
will
just
write
to
one
another
now
and
then
and
you
must
not
bother
to
come
up
to
see
me
we
do
not
think
alike
on
any
point
but
i
shall
always
remember
how
good
you
were
to
me
when
i
was
a
tiresome
little
girl
oh
kitten
and
matilda
felt
almost
tearful
for
apart
from
her
fear
of
reawakening
her
fianc√©
interest
in
her
sister
she
still
had
a
secret
affection
for
her
yes
you
were
very
good
to
me
then
tild
but
now
we
have
come
to
a
final
parting
of
the
ways
and
we
are
all
satisfied
i
shall
fulfil
my
ideas
and
you
will
fulfil
yours
and
afterwards
when
she
walked
back
to
berkeley
square
she
pondered
deeply
there
was
no
such
thing
as
family
affection
really
in
the
abstract
it
only
held
when
the
individuals
were
in
sympathy
and
had
a
community
of
interests
they
her
family
were
as
glad
at
the
thought
that
they
had
risen
above
her
and
need
not
communicate
in
the
future
as
she
was
that
she
would
not
have
to
bring
her
mind
down
to
their
point
of
view
matilda
was
the
last
link
and
matilda
had
shown
that
she
desired
also
to
break
away
katherine
felt
that
but
for
lady
garribardine
real
affection
for
her
she
was
virtually
alone
in
the
world
if
only
there
were
no
backward
thoughts
in
her
mind
she
would
have
looked
upon
her
fair
future
as
a
certainty
sooner
or
later
with
the
visit
to
valfreyne
in
front
of
her
and
the
frequent
occasions
upon
which
she
must
see
the
duke
at
her
mistress
house
she
knew
she
could
continue
to
attract
him
if
she
so
desired
and
make
him
love
her
with
a
great
love
there
was
that
subtle
indescribable
sympathy
of
ideas
between
them
and
as
algy
had
called
forth
physical
passion
and
gerard
the
awakening
of
the
spirit
this
man
seemed
to
arouse
the
essence
of
all
three
things
the
body
the
spirit
and
the
soul
but
there
lay
this
ugly
shadow
between
them
and
she
began
to
realise
the
meaning
of
the
old
saw
from
horace
black
care
sits
behind
the
horseman
and
she
had
not
yet
made
up
her
mind
to
dislodge
him
and
defy
fate
the
three
days
in
paris
began
to
haunt
her
until
she
severely
took
herself
to
task
and
analysed
everything
she
must
not
look
back
upon
them
in
that
fashion
she
must
remember
them
gratefully
she
told
herself
since
they
had
opened
her
eyes
for
the
first
time
in
a
way
that
nothing
else
could
have
done
and
she
indeed
felt
that
it
was
very
doubtful
if
she
could
ever
have
obtained
lady
garribardine
situation
and
so
her
education
from
gerard
strobridge
without
the
experience
that
that
episode
in
her
life
had
given
her
to
start
upon
it
was
contrary
to
all
her
principles
to
allow
any
past
action
to
influence
with
its
shadow
present
events
she
would
banish
the
whole
subject
from
her
mind
and
leave
the
future
in
the
hand
of
destiny
neither
assisting
fate
by
personal
initiative
nor
resisting
its
march
by
deliberate
renunciation
but
she
seemed
very
quiet
her
ladyship
thought
and
wondered
to
herself
at
the
cause
the
duke
was
in
the
north
paying
other
visits
for
some
weeks
and
when
he
did
come
to
berkeley
square
in
between
times
he
did
not
see
katherine
so
april
passed
and
may
came
and
with
it
the
prospect
of
whitsuntide
early
that
year
whitsunday
fell
upon
the
eleventh
of
may
you
must
have
some
decent
clothes
lady
garribardine
had
said
a
week
or
two
beforehand
another
evening
dress
and
an
afternoon
frock
i
think
i
should
like
the
first
to
be
white
and
the
other
black
and
in
your
own
excellent
taste
you
will
dine
down
every
night
as
a
guest
and
we
shall
stay
from
saturday
until
tuesday
it
is
extremely
exciting
for
me
katherine
admitted
i
wonder
so
much
what
the
house
will
be
like
it
is
a
huge
palladian
monument
very
splendid
and
ducal
everything
is
on
an
immense
scale
and
the
duke
keeps
it
up
with
great
state
it
is
more
like
some
royal
residence
than
a
house
but
there
are
some
cosy
rooms
to
be
found
in
odd
corners
it
will
interest
and
educate
you
child
you
had
better
read
up
all
about
it
in
one
of
the
old
volumes
of
some
three
years
ago
i
think
it
was
described
katherine
lost
no
time
in
doing
this
and
read
of
its
building
in
and
of
its
wonderful
gardens
in
the
french
style
and
of
its
superb
collections
of
pictures
and
art
treasures
and
of
its
avenues
and
lake
and
waterways
and
fountains
yes
it
must
be
a
very
noble
place
they
were
to
arrive
early
in
time
for
luncheon
since
her
ladyship
was
to
act
hostess
to
the
party
who
would
come
in
the
afternoon
and
when
they
approached
the
gates
katherine
felt
that
one
of
the
supreme
moments
in
her
life
had
come
the
park
was
vast
larger
even
than
blissington
and
with
more
open
spaces
and
the
house
could
be
viewed
from
a
distance
a
symmetrical
magnificent
pile
and
it
seemed
that
they
walked
through
an
endless
succession
of
halls
and
great
salons
until
they
were
ushered
into
the
duke
presence
in
his
own
particular
panelled
room
it
was
very
lofty
and
partly
filled
with
bookcases
arranged
in
rather
an
unusual
way
sunk
into
the
wall
itself
with
very
beautiful
decorations
by
grinling
gibbons
surrounding
them
and
also
the
intervening
panels
wherein
fine
pictures
hung
the
curtains
and
chair
coverings
were
of
the
most
superb
old
blue
silk
faded
now
to
a
wonderful
greenish
tone
and
harmonizing
with
the
beautiful
savonnerie
carpet
with
its
soft
tints
of
citron
and
puce
and
green
katherine
was
frankly
awed
blissington
was
a
very
fine
house
but
this
was
a
palace
and
suddenly
the
duke
seemed
a
million
miles
away
from
her
and
she
wondered
how
she
had
ever
dared
to
be
familiar
with
him
and
rebuke
him
for
coming
to
her
schoolroom
to
talk
she
was
meek
as
a
mouse
and
never
opened
her
lips
after
the
first
words
of
greeting
the
host
had
come
forward
with
cordial
graciousness
and
bidden
them
welcome
and
he
had
looked
a
very
magnificent
person
somehow
in
his
morning
country
riding
clothes
and
all
the
glamour
of
high
rank
and
power
and
fastidiousness
enhanced
his
natural
charms
so
that
katherine
felt
a
little
cold
and
sick
with
the
emotion
which
she
was
experiencing
he
was
courtly
and
aloof
in
his
manner
with
all
his
kindness
and
in
a
moment
or
two
he
accompanied
them
along
to
the
venetian
suite
himself
i
must
come
dear
friend
he
had
said
to
lady
garribardine
to
be
sure
that
you
have
everything
you
can
possibly
want
the
venetian
suite
was
on
a
par
in
splendour
with
the
rest
of
the
house
it
was
on
the
same
floor
as
his
grace
own
which
they
had
left
and
it
was
reached
by
a
passage
place
which
led
to
the
same
terrace
which
the
windows
looked
upon
this
was
marble
paved
with
a
splendid
balustrade
the
had
been
arranged
with
a
writing
table
near
the
great
window
and
every
convenience
for
miss
bush
to
do
any
writing
her
mistress
might
require
for
the
rest
the
venetian
suite
was
always
reserved
for
the
most
honoured
guest
here
were
a
a
great
bedroom
and
for
her
ladyship
all
with
the
same
lofty
ceilings
and
fine
windows
as
the
room
they
had
left
and
behind
it
came
that
charming
green
chamber
designed
for
miss
bush
here
in
this
apartment
you
will
find
yourselves
completely
quiet
and
shut
off
from
the
world
the
duke
said
once
you
have
passed
the
great
door
as
you
know
seraphim
your
suite
makes
the
end
of
this
wing
and
only
i
can
approach
you
from
my
lady
garribardine
who
knew
every
nook
in
the
house
smiled
as
she
expressed
herself
as
content
and
he
left
them
alone
katherine
examined
her
room
it
would
have
struck
her
as
very
large
if
it
had
been
in
any
other
house
it
looked
on
to
an
inner
courtyard
with
a
fountain
playing
and
statuary
and
lilac
bushes
in
huge
tubs
the
room
was
hung
with
pale
green
silk
and
had
beautiful
painted
italian
eighteenth
century
furniture
and
on
the
were
bowls
of
lilies
of
the
valley
she
thrilled
a
little
was
this
accidental
or
deliberate
she
was
very
well
acquainted
with
the
workings
of
a
great
house
and
the
duties
of
the
housekeeper
and
groom
of
the
chambers
she
saw
from
a
technical
point
of
view
that
these
retainers
of
valfreyne
must
be
of
a
very
high
order
of
merit
because
of
the
result
of
their
work
but
even
their
intelligence
could
hardly
have
selected
the
volumes
of
her
favourite
authors
which
she
had
discussed
with
the
duke
and
which
were
placed
in
bookstands
with
the
letters
of
abelard
and
h√©loise
and
a
beautiful
edition
of
eothen
out
on
the
top
these
silent
testimonies
of
someone
personal
thought
gave
her
unbounded
pleasure
they
restored
her
submerged
and
made
her
eyes
glow
it
was
divine
to
feel
that
he
cared
enough
to
have
troubled
to
do
this
the
subtle
flattery
was
exquisite
a
burning
wave
of
colour
overspread
katherine
face
and
her
nostrils
quivered
if
the
duke
could
have
seen
her
he
would
have
known
that
that
quality
he
appreciated
the
quality
of
real
natural
passion
was
abundantly
present
in
her
nature
strong
passion
controlled
by
an
iron
will
a
mixture
which
he
thought
quite
ideal
in
the
woman
whom
a
man
would
choose
to
be
the
companion
of
his
life
it
was
this
particular
suggestion
about
katherine
which
had
alike
intoxicated
the
imaginations
of
these
three
far
different
men
lord
algy
gerard
strobridge
and
the
duke
the
human
adorable
warmth
of
emotion
of
which
her
white
face
and
red
full
mouth
looked
capable
lady
garribardine
had
told
her
secretary
to
take
off
her
hat
as
she
might
be
required
to
do
a
little
work
after
lunch
i
shall
settle
with
his
grace
how
i
think
the
party
had
better
sit
and
then
you
can
type
anything
we
want
so
katherine
was
particularly
careful
to
arrange
her
silvery
hair
becomingly
and
looked
the
perfection
of
refined
neatness
as
she
followed
her
mistress
back
into
the
duke
and
then
on
in
to
luncheon
in
a
smaller
in
another
wing
they
were
only
three
at
the
meal
and
the
host
talked
of
politics
and
the
party
who
were
coming
and
was
gracious
he
did
not
treat
katherine
with
the
slightest
condescension
nor
with
any
special
solicitude
if
she
had
been
an
unknown
niece
of
lady
garribardine
his
manner
would
have
been
the
same
katherine
felt
chilled
again
for
the
moment
and
had
never
appeared
more
subdued
she
slipped
off
back
to
her
room
when
they
went
to
have
coffee
in
a
small
known
as
the
gamester
parlour
for
in
it
was
hung
a
picture
of
the
famous
thoroughbred
of
that
name
the
riding
of
whom
in
a
match
against
his
grace
of
chandos
colt
starlight
had
been
the
cause
of
the
third
duke
breaking
his
neck
there
was
no
immediate
work
to
be
done
so
katherine
stood
and
looked
from
the
window
of
her
green
chamber
and
took
in
the
view
surely
she
thought
if
people
even
with
the
intelligence
of
matilda
could
see
such
men
as
the
duke
and
such
splendid
homes
as
this
with
every
evidence
in
it
of
fine
tastes
and
fine
living
and
fine
achievement
stamped
upon
it
by
hundreds
of
years
of
noble
owners
they
could
not
go
on
being
so
blind
to
the
force
of
heredity
and
environment
as
factors
in
determining
the
actions
of
the
human
race
she
stood
for
a
long
time
quite
still
with
trouble
in
her
heart
which
every
fresh
realisation
of
the
beauties
around
her
augmented
no
the
duke
could
never
overlook
the
three
days
even
if
he
could
forget
that
she
had
come
from
bindon
green
and
she
could
not
banish
their
memory
either
and
so
would
never
be
able
to
rely
upon
her
own
power
to
carry
on
the
great
undertaking
untrammelled
by
inward
apprehension
and
at
the
deception
of
so
great
a
man
her
serenity
would
be
gone
and
with
it
her
power
lady
garribardine
opened
the
door
presently
and
saw
her
still
standing
there
run
out
for
a
little
walk
child
she
said
kindly
you
can
reach
the
terrace
from
the
passage
which
has
been
arranged
for
you
to
write
in
and
there
are
steps
at
the
side
into
the
garden
i
shall
not
want
you
until
just
before
tea
the
duke
has
the
menus
and
cards
and
door
names
printed
by
his
own
private
press
then
come
back
with
your
eyes
bright
and
put
on
your
new
black
frock
katherine
thanked
her
there
never
could
be
anyone
kinder
or
more
thoughtful
for
others
than
was
this
arrogant
great
lady
the
girl
walked
in
the
fresh
may
sunshine
but
nothing
lifted
the
weight
which
had
fallen
upon
her
heart
and
her
cheeks
were
paler
than
usual
and
her
air
had
an
added
delicacy
and
refinement
when
she
followed
her
mistress
into
the
great
tapestry
salon
wherein
tea
was
laid
and
which
was
adjacent
to
the
hall
where
guests
were
already
beginning
to
arrive
she
was
not
introduced
to
anyone
else
but
several
she
already
knew
they
were
selected
from
the
de
la
of
her
ladyship
set
of
the
rather
less
modern
sort
mordryn
looked
at
her
constantly
unobserved
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
new
expression
in
her
face
why
would
she
never
meet
his
eyes
and
hers
when
he
did
see
them
turned
upon
ordinary
things
had
a
haunting
melancholy
in
them
very
different
from
the
sphinxlike
smile
of
old
he
found
himself
more
disturbed
than
he
cared
to
own
he
wished
seraphim
had
not
brought
her
after
all
he
wished
but
he
did
not
even
in
his
thoughts
form
words
had
her
changed
air
anything
to
do
with
that
last
abrupt
request
on
the
march
morning
walk
that
he
should
remember
who
she
was
and
who
he
was
and
leave
her
alone
was
it
possible
that
she
felt
something
for
him
how
wrong
he
had
been
in
that
case
to
put
the
eothen
and
the
abelard
and
h√©loise
and
the
lilies
of
the
valley
in
her
room
cruel
and
wrong
he
knew
now
that
he
saw
her
again
that
he
had
thought
of
her
very
constantly
ever
since
easter
time
and
had
chafed
at
getting
no
sight
of
her
when
he
had
twice
been
in
london
and
had
gone
to
berkeley
square
though
his
determination
had
held
at
that
time
and
he
had
made
no
attempt
to
see
her
or
even
to
mention
her
name
but
he
knew
that
he
had
looked
forward
more
eagerly
each
day
to
whitsuntide
and
that
he
had
taken
peculiar
delight
in
the
surreptitious
supervision
of
the
details
of
her
lodgment
and
the
choice
of
volumes
wherewith
to
refresh
her
mind
but
was
this
chivalrous
on
his
part
was
he
not
playing
upon
the
feelings
of
one
defenceless
and
in
a
dependent
position
one
who
could
not
even
flee
he
grew
uncomfortable
he
was
painfully
conscious
of
her
presence
and
a
sudden
mad
longing
came
to
him
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
kiss
away
the
trouble
from
her
eyes
and
then
the
cynical
and
humorous
side
of
his
character
made
him
smile
at
the
idea
of
such
feelings
in
a
room
full
of
guests
guests
of
his
own
world
and
for
the
humble
secretary
of
his
old
love
he
fretted
under
the
restraint
of
his
unease
and
she
was
here
in
his
house
and
he
must
suffer
the
temptation
of
her
presence
for
three
more
days
he
must
not
look
at
her
must
not
talk
to
her
he
must
not
have
any
subtle
understanding
with
her
about
the
books
must
not
in
short
do
anything
he
desired
lady
garribardine
watched
the
passage
of
events
with
an
understanding
eye
something
further
must
be
done
she
felt
so
just
before
dressing
time
when
the
company
had
dispersed
she
went
with
her
host
into
his
own
the
evening
post
had
come
in
mordryn
i
wanted
to
ask
you
can
i
send
a
wire
over
to
hornwell
i
have
just
heard
sir
john
townly
is
staying
there
and
i
want
to
suggest
that
he
motor
over
to
tea
it
will
be
a
splendid
chance
for
him
to
have
a
quiet
hour
with
my
katherine
bush
i
would
like
him
to
see
her
here
as
a
guest
he
is
very
much
in
love
with
her
in
his
heavy
way
and
i
believe
i
could
get
the
matter
settled
all
right
if
you
would
only
help
me
like
a
dear
the
duke
experienced
a
most
unpleasant
twinge
this
was
rather
more
than
he
had
bargained
for
why
should
sir
john
townly
be
given
this
opportunity
in
his
house
the
match
is
quite
unsuitable
seraphim
i
ca
think
how
you
can
countenance
it
her
ladyship
appeared
deliberately
to
misunderstand
him
but
i
assure
you
mordryn
sir
john
is
not
in
the
least
upset
by
her
origin
or
her
suburban
relations
he
realises
the
magnificent
qualities
of
the
creature
herself
and
he
knows
very
well
that
she
will
make
the
finest
hostess
and
the
most
dignified
figurehead
for
dullinglea
that
he
could
find
besides
with
her
health
and
youth
he
can
look
forward
to
a
strong
little
son
by
this
time
next
year
mordryn
found
himself
absolutely
revolted
katherine
so
her
name
was
katherine
katherine
this
delicious
creature
to
be
the
mother
of
that
shocking
bore
john
townly
son
the
red
flush
mounted
to
his
broad
forehead
it
is
not
their
relative
worldly
positions
i
alluded
to
seraphim
but
their
ages
and
appearances
and
oh
tastes
i
think
it
is
perfectly
inhuman
of
you
and
i
can
not
countenance
such
a
thing
mordryn
i
am
really
surprised
how
can
it
possibly
matter
to
you
you
must
have
seen
for
yourself
that
night
at
gerard
what
a
charming
companion
she
can
make
and
how
utterly
she
is
wasted
in
the
position
of
secretary
and
yet
you
wo
help
me
to
do
the
poor
child
this
good
turn
if
you
put
it
in
that
way
ask
whom
you
like
but
i
can
not
think
how
any
woman
to
escape
any
position
could
sell
herself
to
such
a
man
as
john
townly
his
tone
was
heated
and
his
blue
eyes
flashed
that
is
just
the
tiresome
part
of
it
and
her
ladyship
looked
concerned
i
believe
she
has
your
same
foolish
and
romantic
ideas
and
so
i
thought
if
she
could
see
him
here
among
this
fine
company
perhaps
the
desire
to
remain
in
it
and
the
glamour
of
the
thing
might
bring
her
up
to
the
scratch
mordryn
do
help
me
like
a
kind
friend
just
think
if
she
were
to
leave
me
whom
else
would
she
ever
see
she
has
quite
separated
from
her
own
family
she
has
nothing
but
a
life
of
drudgery
in
front
of
her
and
she
is
fitted
in
every
way
to
be
a
queen
she
is
so
extremely
she
would
never
make
any
slips
afterwards
and
her
ambitions
could
be
gratified
and
make
up
for
lack
of
love
i
think
the
idea
is
disgusting
his
grace
snapped
impatiently
but
send
your
wire
by
all
means
then
he
abruptly
turned
the
conversation
and
presently
her
ladyship
left
him
alone
very
well
pleased
with
her
work
and
the
groom
of
the
chambers
was
handed
a
warmly
worded
invitation
to
telegraph
to
hornwell
as
she
passed
to
her
room
chapter
xxix
when
he
was
left
alone
the
duke
swore
sharply
to
himself
he
was
not
a
man
accustomed
to
the
use
of
strong
language
but
occasions
arose
in
life
sometimes
when
a
good
sound
oath
seemed
to
relieve
tension
then
he
paced
up
and
down
his
long
room
his
imagination
was
on
fire
he
could
see
katherine
he
dwelt
on
the
name
katherine
in
the
baboon
embrace
of
old
john
townly
loathsome
picture
yes
of
course
she
would
adorn
any
position
and
dullinglea
was
only
a
very
moderate
house
he
could
see
her
tall
slender
graceful
figure
sweeping
in
rich
velvets
through
much
larger
rooms
than
it
contained
such
rooms
for
example
as
these
his
own
at
valfreyne
she
would
sit
between
young
westonborough
and
old
barchester
but
in
a
place
where
a
gap
in
the
flowers
would
give
him
the
host
a
continuous
view
of
her
then
he
went
off
to
dress
in
a
fiery
mood
katherine
meanwhile
had
been
looking
over
eothen
and
noting
the
marked
passages
which
she
found
to
be
the
same
mutual
favourites
they
had
discovered
that
night
at
gerard
had
her
host
underlined
them
since
then
or
were
they
marked
before
then
she
peeped
at
abelard
and
h√©loise
and
turned
over
all
the
leaves
none
of
them
had
any
pencillings
but
her
eye
caught
this
sensible
paragraph
and
it
stiffened
her
jaded
spirit
and
made
her
feel
more
calm
void
of
reason
are
men
said
seneca
make
distant
evils
present
by
reflection
and
to
take
pains
before
death
to
lose
all
the
comfort
of
life
she
was
here
at
a
splendid
party
as
a
guest
like
everyone
else
and
she
must
enjoy
it
and
forget
anything
but
the
pleasure
of
the
moment
but
oh
if
the
duke
would
only
talk
to
her
she
wore
the
new
white
frock
and
looked
quite
beautiful
and
some
of
the
lilies
of
the
valley
shone
in
her
belt
lady
garribardine
was
extremely
pleased
with
her
appearance
and
patted
her
arm
sir
john
townly
is
coming
over
from
hornwell
child
and
i
want
you
to
be
agreeable
to
him
for
me
as
i
shall
be
very
busy
you
must
take
him
for
a
little
walk
her
ladyship
knew
that
however
irksome
it
would
appear
to
katherine
her
command
would
be
obeyed
the
duke
eyes
were
full
of
suppressed
passion
at
dinner
and
his
wit
was
caustic
katherine
could
not
hear
it
but
could
see
his
face
and
the
puzzled
expression
which
now
and
then
came
over
the
two
ladies
on
either
side
of
him
and
once
she
met
his
gaze
and
there
was
pain
and
a
challenge
in
it
excitement
rose
in
her
before
dessert
came
she
knew
she
felt
he
was
conscious
of
her
presence
and
that
it
was
not
indifference
which
kept
him
from
her
side
what
was
it
all
leading
to
it
was
very
evident
that
he
was
determined
not
to
succumb
to
whatever
it
might
be
it
was
also
evident
that
he
certainly
did
experience
emotion
katherine
felt
unhappy
but
this
must
not
prevent
her
from
talking
politely
and
sympathetically
to
the
ladies
she
happened
to
be
sitting
next
to
in
the
great
until
the
men
came
in
she
remarked
how
protective
and
gracious
her
own
dear
ladyship
was
being
to
her
saying
a
word
in
passing
and
making
her
feel
at
home
and
an
equal
and
a
guest
she
must
be
very
grateful
for
these
things
and
not
look
ahead
why
had
this
new
and
sudden
sense
of
values
come
over
her
this
realisation
of
the
frightful
obstacle
created
by
the
blemish
of
the
three
days
at
the
dinner
at
gerard
she
had
not
so
much
as
remembered
them
their
meaning
had
come
in
a
flash
with
the
thrill
of
the
kiss
of
homage
upon
her
hand
had
she
been
contemplating
union
with
sir
john
she
would
have
looked
upon
them
as
a
fortunate
experience
to
guide
her
in
her
knowledge
of
men
so
this
was
some
psychological
witness
to
the
demands
of
the
spirit
of
love
of
love
that
desires
to
give
only
the
pure
gold
untarnished
to
the
lover
she
felt
like
a
caged
bird
and
her
triumphant
evening
of
pleasing
women
and
earning
the
admiration
of
all
who
spoke
to
her
tasted
only
as
dead
sea
fruit
now
the
duke
when
the
men
left
the
walked
straight
to
his
own
he
was
a
man
of
rapid
action
and
supreme
he
opened
the
inner
door
softly
and
listened
there
was
no
sound
he
could
move
with
impunity
there
was
no
one
in
the
passage
room
but
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
the
housemaids
he
knew
would
be
coming
round
almost
immediately
with
the
cans
of
hot
water
for
the
night
he
crossed
the
space
and
deliberately
entered
the
green
room
turning
on
the
light
as
he
did
so
he
hastily
looked
about
at
the
books
yes
she
had
put
the
two
special
ones
by
her
bed
and
abelard
and
h√©loise
was
underneath
he
pulled
it
out
and
quickly
found
a
passage
he
wanted
and
with
his
gold
pencil
he
scored
it
deeply
underneath
and
putting
the
volume
on
the
top
he
swiftly
left
the
room
and
was
again
in
his
own
and
on
his
way
to
the
white
the
whole
affair
had
not
taken
two
minutes
and
with
the
knowledge
of
this
fact
accomplished
he
looked
almost
serene
as
he
sat
down
by
a
great
lady
side
and
determinedly
avoided
looking
at
katherine
so
the
evening
passed
without
speech
between
them
beyond
and
miss
bush
retired
sorrowfully
to
bed
but
she
could
not
sleep
and
kept
on
the
light
to
read
there
were
eothen
and
abelard
and
h√©loise
close
to
her
side
their
order
of
placing
reversed
since
she
had
left
them
this
change
effected
by
the
housemaids
no
doubt
and
the
love
letters
being
on
the
top
she
opened
them
first
she
read
many
exquisite
thoughts
and
was
just
thinking
of
sleep
when
she
turned
a
page
and
suddenly
sat
bolt
upright
in
bed
for
this
is
what
she
read
i
wish
to
heaven
you
had
not
such
a
power
over
me
and
the
passage
was
deeply
underlined
her
heart
beat
to
suffocation
there
had
been
no
such
mark
in
this
place
when
she
had
read
this
very
page
before
dinner
how
had
it
come
there
who
who
but
there
was
only
one
person
who
could
have
done
such
a
thing
the
duke
she
bent
nearer
the
lamp
and
devoured
the
lines
again
and
then
she
passionately
kissed
the
words
and
turned
out
the
light
next
day
sunday
a
number
of
the
party
went
to
church
their
host
among
them
but
katherine
and
lady
garribardine
did
not
accompany
them
they
were
seated
on
the
tennis
lawn
watching
a
game
when
the
joined
the
group
three
magnificent
cedars
of
lebanon
made
a
great
patch
of
shade
and
here
the
chairs
were
placed
the
duke
took
one
and
stretched
himself
on
it
as
though
fatigued
his
grey
felt
hat
was
tilted
over
his
eyes
he
made
a
pleasing
picture
of
length
of
limb
and
grace
and
distinction
the
same
curious
emotion
crept
over
katherine
again
as
she
had
already
experienced
half
quiver
half
shock
a
strong
desire
to
be
very
close
to
him
to
touch
him
to
feel
herself
caressing
and
caressed
his
hands
were
clasped
idly
upon
his
knee
and
his
voice
as
he
spoke
softly
to
a
lady
was
lazy
and
complacent
oh
how
extremely
bitter
the
whole
situation
was
proving
to
be
the
emerald
ring
seemed
to
flash
green
fire
as
a
tiny
glint
of
sunlight
struck
it
it
caught
the
attention
of
the
sprightly
dame
to
whom
his
grace
was
talking
what
a
very
wonderful
ring
that
is
you
wear
duke
has
it
a
history
yes
a
very
remarkable
one
katherine
listened
deeply
interested
she
had
so
often
wondered
about
this
ring
too
it
has
been
in
the
family
since
the
last
crusade
it
came
back
with
the
tradition
attached
that
it
was
the
famous
graven
emerald
seal
which
theodoras
made
for
polycrates
tyrant
of
samos
about
and
which
was
in
vain
thrown
into
the
sea
to
be
lost
it
was
brought
back
to
polycrates
in
the
body
of
a
fish
next
day
such
exampled
luck
was
considered
to
be
ominous
by
his
ally
amasis
who
broke
off
all
alliance
with
him
in
consequence
and
truly
enough
he
was
not
long
after
murdered
from
jealousy
of
his
good
fortune
the
ring
then
disappeared
and
was
supposed
later
to
have
been
found
by
a
roman
who
handed
it
down
for
generations
until
it
somehow
got
back
into
greece
and
when
wrecked
there
on
his
way
home
from
palestine
the
rievaulx
of
the
day
obtained
it
from
its
owner
how
history
does
not
say
and
it
has
always
been
with
us
ever
since
a
strange
belief
attaching
to
it
that
if
life
is
happy
it
must
not
be
worn
but
that
if
things
have
gone
ill
then
it
is
safe
to
wear
it
for
the
rest
of
time
he
put
out
his
hand
for
the
lady
to
look
at
the
stone
and
a
knot
of
interested
people
drew
near
you
see
his
grace
continued
it
is
deeply
graven
with
a
lyre
and
sometimes
it
seems
to
be
dull
and
sometimes
it
flashes
angrily
are
you
not
afraid
to
wear
it
some
tactless
person
said
the
duke
replied
gravely
why
should
i
be
i
have
amply
fulfilled
all
the
conditions
attached
and
then
the
company
remembering
the
dark
and
ugly
shadow
of
the
mad
duchess
which
had
hung
over
his
life
for
so
many
years
all
seemed
to
talk
at
once
and
so
the
slightly
awkward
moment
passed
but
katherine
thought
deeply
upon
the
subject
as
she
sat
in
a
wicker
chair
yes
how
ill
his
life
had
gone
and
he
was
now
years
old
and
if
it
were
true
that
he
felt
enough
to
have
taken
the
trouble
to
score
that
sentence
in
her
book
his
present
frame
of
mind
could
not
be
altogether
happy
either
and
she
sighed
why
was
happiness
so
often
a
forbidden
fruit
for
a
second
before
lunch
she
happened
to
be
standing
near
him
and
so
some
kind
of
words
were
necessary
for
politeness
sake
i
hope
you
find
your
room
comfortable
miss
bush
and
that
you
have
all
that
you
want
she
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
and
there
was
a
world
of
meaning
in
hers
as
she
answered
everything
thank
you
and
i
am
especially
interested
in
the
books
the
last
guest
who
slept
there
must
have
taken
liberties
with
your
volumes
and
put
strange
pencillings
under
some
of
the
paragraphs
which
i
only
discovered
last
night
it
was
a
man
who
occupied
the
room
lately
what
presumption
he
showed
yes
i
wondered
if
you
knew
about
it
the
most
significant
marking
is
in
the
letters
of
and
h√©loise
the
scribbler
had
a
turn
for
sentiment
it
would
seem
and
probably
was
suffering
from
hallucinations
as
to
his
own
state
which
he
imagined
to
be
one
of
subjection
no
he
was
a
fellow
who
was
not
particularly
happy
though
i
remember
and
no
doubt
he
found
solace
in
reading
about
the
despairing
passion
of
those
two
and
in
underlining
that
passage
which
records
rebellion
against
pain
so
like
his
own
katherine
sighed
happiness
alas
lies
in
the
hand
only
of
the
very
strong
and
she
passed
on
to
another
group
and
the
duke
frowned
a
little
as
they
went
in
to
lunch
sir
john
townly
came
over
in
the
afternoon
as
he
had
been
invited
to
do
and
lady
garribardine
intimated
to
her
secretary
that
now
she
must
take
this
incubus
off
her
hands
so
katherine
obediently
proposed
a
stroll
round
the
wonderful
tulip
beds
which
were
in
full
bloom
and
mordryn
saw
them
go
off
together
from
the
window
where
he
stood
i
really
do
not
think
it
looks
so
ridiculous
after
all
lady
garribardine
remarked
to
him
reflectively
complacence
in
her
tone
he
is
quite
a
fine
figure
of
a
man
except
for
his
perfectly
bald
head
and
that
does
not
show
now
in
his
hat
the
duke
made
an
exclamation
of
disgust
poor
miss
bush
i
do
hope
she
wo
be
foolish
but
she
has
been
so
odd
lately
i
can
not
understand
these
girls
odd
yes
and
quiet
of
course
i
would
not
force
her
into
anything
she
did
not
like
but
still
sir
john
would
be
better
than
some
attractive
and
penniless
young
guardsman
with
nothing
to
offer
but
love
young
there
are
one
or
two
who
come
over
from
windsor
who
rather
hang
about
oh
yes
certainly
emphatically
agreed
the
duke
and
then
he
thought
of
another
sentence
in
that
book
which
seemed
such
a
bond
between
them
one
where
wrote
what
a
comfort
i
felt
in
seeing
you
shut
up
yes
to
marry
old
sir
john
would
almost
be
the
equivalent
of
a
convent
but
not
quite
there
was
always
the
thought
that
however
old
he
would
still
be
the
undisputed
possessor
of
this
most
desirable
piece
of
womanhood
his
would
be
the
right
to
clothe
and
feed
her
and
give
her
jewels
his
to
hold
her
in
his
arms
the
realisation
of
all
this
was
maddening
to
mordryn
for
he
no
longer
disguised
from
himself
that
he
profoundly
desired
to
exercise
these
rights
himself
and
she
had
said
that
happiness
only
lay
in
the
hands
of
the
very
yes
but
how
could
one
define
strong
strong
in
fidelity
to
tradition
and
family
and
race
and
class
or
strong
to
break
all
barriers
and
seize
that
thing
a
man
heart
cries
out
for
passionately
his
mate
his
soul
and
his
body
mate
these
were
problems
which
were
distressingly
agitating
to
think
over
and
distracted
his
mind
from
the
duties
towards
guests
what
a
time
she
spent
in
pointing
out
those
tulips
to
that
old
fool
what
pompous
gallantry
his
attitude
expressed
of
course
the
girl
must
be
bored
to
death
why
had
she
been
odd
lately
quiet
and
sad
oh
how
divine
it
would
be
to
go
off
to
the
belvedere
presently
and
see
the
sunset
from
over
there
by
the
lake
and
ask
her
many
things
and
then
as
they
looked
on
the
water
from
the
marble
terrace
if
the
falcon
eye
grew
sweet
again
and
soft
to
read
dear
messages
there
and
fold
her
to
his
heart
she
was
so
subtle
she
understood
every
shade
in
anything
he
said
they
had
the
same
tastes
and
the
same
likings
in
books
and
art
she
did
not
know
italy
and
france
what
supreme
pleasure
to
wander
there
and
discover
their
manifold
beauties
to
her
and
above
all
she
was
young
and
fresh
and
passionate
who
could
doubt
it
who
looked
into
her
fair
face
or
knew
anything
about
type
if
she
loved
him
she
would
never
be
cold
but
would
amply
repay
him
for
his
long
starvation
and
abstinence
from
joy
the
lonely
splendour
of
valfreyne
would
then
become
a
happy
home
filled
with
interest
and
affection
how
was
he
going
to
get
through
another
twenty
years
of
dull
duty
after
his
of
anguish
and
grief
he
supposed
he
might
live
to
be
eighty
even
the
monluces
were
a
tenacious
race
here
lady
garribardine
deemed
it
prudent
to
divert
his
thoughts
she
realised
that
the
moment
for
the
final
good
which
would
draw
him
over
the
brink
into
happiness
had
not
yet
come
so
she
spoke
of
soothing
things
and
then
amused
him
and
coaxed
him
into
a
more
peaceful
state
only
again
to
see
him
restive
when
the
pair
eventually
came
in
from
the
tulip
beds
katherine
looked
tired
and
depressed
but
sir
john
had
an
air
of
gratification
about
him
which
made
mordryn
feel
that
he
could
willingly
have
punched
his
head
his
good
manners
alone
enabled
him
to
bid
a
cordial
farewell
to
the
poor
man
when
presently
he
left
the
sun
was
declining
and
the
colours
were
opal
over
the
lake
the
duties
of
host
to
so
many
charming
ladies
restrained
the
duke
and
he
had
the
mortification
of
seeing
katherine
and
another
girl
go
off
with
two
of
the
young
men
in
two
canoes
on
the
topaz
waters
and
by
the
time
he
went
to
dress
he
was
almost
desperate
katherine
was
in
black
and
a
red
rose
was
in
her
belt
where
had
she
got
it
from
had
that
insupportable
young
westonborough
whom
she
had
been
in
the
canoe
with
given
it
to
her
surely
bilton
had
not
been
so
remiss
as
not
to
have
seen
that
fresh
lilies
were
put
in
the
green
room
but
perhaps
she
preferred
the
red
rose
women
were
incredibly
fickle
and
capricious
lady
garribardine
perceived
the
expression
of
fierceness
in
his
eyes
and
so
contrived
that
even
a
single
sentence
with
katherine
was
impossible
and
thus
the
evening
passed
and
were
said
and
there
remained
only
the
one
more
day
chapter
xxx
katherine
read
abelard
and
h√©loise
far
into
the
night
her
emotions
were
complex
she
knew
now
that
she
was
very
unhappy
and
in
a
corner
and
that
she
could
not
see
clearly
any
way
of
escape
if
she
attracted
the
duke
further
it
would
only
increase
the
complications
there
was
something
in
her
nature
which
she
feared
was
not
strong
enough
to
carry
through
deceit
her
great
power
had
always
lain
in
her
absolute
honesty
which
gave
her
that
inward
serenity
which
engenders
the
most
supreme
and
so
inevitably
draws
the
thing
desired
her
mind
was
too
balanced
and
too
analytical
to
give
way
to
impulse
regardless
of
cost
which
in
such
a
situation
would
have
made
nine
hundred
and
women
out
of
a
thousand
grab
at
the
chance
of
securing
mordryn
upon
any
terms
of
what
good
to
obtain
the
position
of
duchess
if
it
only
brought
a
haunting
unease
of
what
good
to
obtain
the
love
of
this
true
and
splendid
gentleman
upon
false
pretences
she
could
then
enjoy
nothing
of
the
results
for
above
all
worldly
gains
she
was
well
aware
that
to
keep
her
own
rigid
mattered
to
her
most
if
his
character
had
been
less
worthy
of
reverence
if
she
had
not
grown
so
near
to
passionately
loving
him
if
she
had
not
become
aware
of
the
importance
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
of
the
barrier
between
them
and
so
of
the
magnitude
of
the
offence
involved
in
the
deceit
she
would
have
played
her
game
to
a
finish
without
a
backward
thought
but
as
it
was
it
were
better
frankly
to
give
it
up
and
perhaps
marry
sir
john
for
none
of
these
considerations
she
felt
came
into
the
question
of
marrying
sir
john
he
was
old
and
pompous
and
of
no
great
family
she
would
be
giving
more
than
she
received
in
bestowing
her
youth
and
her
talents
and
her
company
upon
him
she
did
not
love
him
therefore
whether
he
should
ever
look
upon
her
with
scorn
or
no
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
her
and
she
would
not
for
a
moment
have
dreamed
of
any
obligation
to
reveal
that
episode
in
her
past
to
him
since
the
probabilities
were
so
very
remote
that
discovery
could
ever
happen
and
therefore
her
silence
would
in
no
way
injure
him
it
would
be
merely
a
bargain
in
which
an
old
man
bought
a
young
woman
as
she
stood
so
to
speak
for
the
pleasure
of
his
eye
but
the
duke
of
mordryn
was
different
between
them
there
could
be
no
deceptions
no
secrets
there
must
be
none
but
the
highest
things
since
marriage
with
him
would
mean
the
union
of
their
souls
katherine
was
far
from
being
altruistic
or
sentimental
it
was
only
the
strictly
common
sense
and
baldly
honest
aspect
of
any
case
that
ever
influenced
her
the
temptation
was
overpowering
of
course
to
brush
aside
moral
to
think
of
reigning
in
this
splendid
place
and
she
let
her
imagination
run
on
to
think
of
being
with
the
duke
always
his
loved
companion
the
joy
to
make
him
very
happy
and
do
everything
he
wished
what
pains
she
would
take
to
fulfil
his
highest
ideal
of
her
to
show
to
his
world
that
whatever
she
had
sprung
from
at
least
she
carried
off
the
situation
of
duchess
in
a
manner
in
which
they
could
find
no
flaw
she
would
be
gracious
and
sweet
and
dignified
and
capable
she
would
bring
all
her
reasoning
to
bear
upon
all
problems
she
would
let
him
guide
and
direct
her
and
she
would
carry
out
his
least
behest
it
could
not
she
had
made
an
initial
mistake
and
miscalculation
in
her
career
through
ignorance
of
possible
results
and
she
could
never
shuffle
out
of
it
was
of
all
mental
attitudes
the
one
she
despised
the
most
she
must
face
the
consequence
of
her
mistake
now
with
courage
and
take
the
second
best
having
once
made
up
her
mind
in
the
early
dawn
it
was
not
in
her
nature
to
indulge
in
further
repining
she
as
resolutely
shut
out
the
image
of
the
duke
and
the
picture
of
happiness
with
him
as
she
had
shut
out
lord
algy
only
this
time
the
pain
was
infinitely
more
bitter
because
she
knew
that
she
was
obliged
to
refrain
from
sipping
this
glorious
cup
of
her
own
whereas
when
she
parted
from
lord
algy
she
had
had
the
moral
elation
of
knowing
that
she
was
doing
rather
a
fine
thing
extreme
pallor
showed
in
her
face
in
the
morning
and
her
great
eyes
were
shadowed
and
sad
she
remained
in
the
at
the
which
had
been
prepared
for
her
after
she
had
breakfasted
with
lady
garribardine
in
her
numbers
of
letters
had
come
by
the
sunday
post
and
she
made
it
seem
necessary
to
answer
them
at
once
her
mistress
allowed
her
to
have
her
way
she
felt
some
strong
underneath
currents
were
affecting
the
girl
and
further
tantalization
would
not
be
bad
for
the
duke
so
she
left
her
at
the
and
joined
the
rest
of
the
party
under
the
cedar
trees
on
the
tennis
lawn
and
did
not
mention
katherine
or
her
whereabouts
if
mordryn
wanted
to
know
why
she
had
not
come
out
or
where
she
was
he
must
pluck
up
courage
to
ask
himself
the
duke
glanced
at
her
enquiringly
but
he
said
nothing
perhaps
katherine
would
follow
presently
but
could
she
have
gone
again
on
the
lake
with
lady
alethea
and
those
young
men
he
would
not
ask
he
would
go
himself
and
see
so
when
he
had
disposed
of
his
important
guests
he
went
to
his
own
from
which
there
was
a
complete
view
of
the
waterways
and
then
he
took
the
trouble
to
get
out
his
glasses
and
scan
the
occupants
of
the
boats
no
she
was
not
among
them
she
must
then
either
be
still
in
her
bedroom
or
writing
perhaps
in
front
of
the
window
of
the
passage
place
which
was
next
this
very
room
he
would
go
out
on
the
terrace
from
one
of
the
windows
and
look
in
yes
she
was
there
seated
at
the
table
very
busy
it
appeared
he
came
forward
and
stepping
across
the
threshold
he
stood
beside
her
good
morning
miss
bush
it
is
quite
wrong
for
you
to
be
working
on
this
glorious
day
you
must
come
out
into
the
sunshine
with
the
rest
of
us
katherine
did
not
rise
or
appear
to
be
going
to
follow
his
suggestion
so
he
added
authoritatively
now
be
a
good
girl
and
go
and
get
your
hat
i
am
very
sorry
i
can
not
before
lunch
i
have
much
work
to
do
and
it
becomes
disorganised
if
i
leave
it
unfinished
nonsense
you
did
not
come
to
valfreyne
to
work
there
are
such
a
number
of
things
i
want
to
show
you
everyone
is
out
in
the
garden
wo
you
at
least
come
round
the
state
rooms
with
me
how
could
she
refuse
him
he
was
her
host
and
the
pleasure
would
be
so
intense
she
rose
but
without
alacrity
and
answered
a
little
stiffly
i
should
much
like
to
see
them
if
it
will
not
take
very
long
her
manner
was
distinctly
different
he
noticed
it
at
once
a
curtain
seemed
to
have
fallen
between
them
ever
since
the
conversation
about
the
pencillings
in
the
book
it
chilled
him
and
made
him
determined
to
remove
it
he
held
the
door
into
his
open
for
her
and
took
pains
to
keep
the
conversation
upon
the
ostensible
reason
for
their
voyage
of
inspection
he
spoke
of
carving
and
dates
and
told
her
anecdotes
of
the
building
of
valfreyne
and
so
they
passed
on
through
all
the
splendid
rooms
the
king
chamber
and
the
queen
closet
and
the
salons
and
so
to
the
great
state
suite
of
her
who
should
be
reigning
duchess
and
katherine
saw
priceless
gems
of
art
and
splendour
of
gilding
and
tapestry
and
hangings
and
great
ghostly
beds
surmounted
with
nodding
ostrich
plumes
and
stuffs
from
venice
and
lyons
and
even
spitalfields
how
wonderful
she
said
at
last
and
there
are
many
other
places
such
as
this
in
england
how
great
and
rich
a
country
it
is
we
the
middle
class
population
shut
in
with
our
narrow
parochial
views
do
not
realise
it
at
all
or
we
would
be
very
proud
of
our
race
owning
such
glorious
things
and
would
not
want
to
encourage
stupid
paltry
politicians
to
destroy
and
dissipate
them
all
and
scatter
them
to
the
winds
it
may
seem
hard
in
their
view
that
one
man
should
possess
we
will
say
valfreyne
but
how
stupid
how
could
it
all
have
been
accumulated
but
for
individual
wealth
and
taste
and
tradition
who
really
cares
for
museums
except
to
study
examples
in
do
you
know
for
instance
such
people
as
my
sisters
would
a
thousand
times
rather
walk
through
these
rooms
on
a
day
when
the
public
is
let
in
feeling
it
was
a
house
owned
by
people
who
really
lived
there
than
go
to
any
place
given
to
the
nation
like
hampton
court
or
the
wallace
collection
that
is
the
human
interest
in
the
thing
yes
but
the
human
and
the
personal
are
the
strongest
and
most
binding
of
all
interests
mordryn
looked
at
her
appreciatively
he
delighted
in
hearing
her
views
then
you
have
no
feeling
that
you
wish
all
this
to
be
divided
up
among
the
people
of
lulworth
say
the
large
town
near
oh
no
no
so
strongly
do
i
feel
for
the
law
by
which
all
goes
to
the
eldest
son
that
were
i
a
younger
one
i
would
willingly
give
up
my
share
to
ensure
the
family
continuing
great
who
that
can
see
clearly
would
not
rather
be
a
younger
son
of
a
splendid
house
than
a
little
ridiculous
nobody
on
his
own
account
if
everything
were
to
be
divided
up
it
is
so
very
strange
that
you
should
have
this
spirit
miss
bush
if
you
had
not
told
me
of
your
parentage
i
should
have
said
you
were
of
the
same
root
and
branch
as
lady
garribardine
are
you
sure
you
are
not
a
changeling
quite
sure
how
proud
it
must
make
you
feel
to
own
valfreyne
and
what
obligations
it
must
entail
yes
and
he
sighed
it
must
make
you
weigh
every
action
to
see
if
it
is
worthy
of
one
who
must
be
an
example
for
so
many
people
that
is
how
you
look
upon
great
position
it
is
a
noble
way
why
of
course
it
could
not
be
right
to
hold
all
this
in
trust
for
your
descendants
and
for
the
glory
of
england
and
then
to
think
yourself
free
to
squander
it
and
degrade
the
standard
all
feeling
would
have
to
give
way
to
worthily
fulfilling
your
trust
the
duke
felt
his
heart
sink
a
strange
feeling
of
depression
came
over
him
i
suppose
you
are
right
and
he
sighed
again
i
was
so
much
interested
in
the
story
of
your
ring
she
said
presently
to
lift
the
silence
which
had
fallen
upon
them
both
it
is
such
a
strange
idea
that
great
good
fortune
is
unlucky
since
we
always
draw
what
we
deserve
if
we
are
foolish
and
draw
misfortune
at
the
beginning
of
our
lives
we
must
of
course
pay
the
price
but
if
brains
are
properly
balanced
they
should
not
fear
good
fortune
in
itself
you
think
then
that
a
whole
life
need
not
be
shadowed
with
misery
but
that
if
the
price
of
folly
is
paid
in
youth
there
may
still
be
a
chance
of
a
happy
old
age
of
course
one
must
be
quite
true
that
is
all
and
never
deceive
anyone
who
trusts
one
that
would
mean
living
in
a
palace
of
truth
and
would
be
impracticable
not
at
all
there
are
some
things
people
have
no
right
to
ask
or
to
be
told
some
things
one
must
keep
to
oneself
for
the
carrying
on
of
life
but
if
a
person
has
a
right
to
know
and
trusts
you
and
you
deceive
him
then
you
must
take
the
consequences
of
unhappiness
which
is
the
reflex
action
of
untruth
how
wise
you
are
child
that
is
the
whole
meaning
of
honour
thine
own
self
be
true
and
it
must
follow
as
the
night
the
day
thou
canst
not
then
be
false
to
any
man
she
looked
straight
up
into
his
eyes
hers
were
pure
and
deep
and
sorrowful
now
i
have
seen
your
beautiful
home
i
must
go
back
to
my
work
i
shall
always
remember
this
visit
and
this
happy
morning
all
my
life
mordryn
was
deeply
moved
passionate
emotion
was
coursing
through
him
with
great
difficulty
he
restrained
the
words
which
rose
to
his
lips
he
did
not
seek
to
detain
her
and
they
retraced
their
steps
speaking
little
by
the
way
until
they
came
to
his
when
you
go
will
you
take
with
you
the
and
the
and
h√©loise
i
would
like
to
know
that
you
read
them
sometimes
and
there
is
one
passage
in
first
letter
which
i
know
i
shall
have
to
quote
to
myself
it
is
on
the
page
the
bottom
paragraph
you
must
look
at
it
some
time
then
his
voice
broke
a
little
and
now
let
us
say
here
in
my
room
said
katherine
and
held
out
her
hand
the
duke
took
it
and
with
it
drew
her
near
to
him
beloved
he
whispered
and
his
tones
were
hoarse
and
then
he
dropped
her
hand
and
katherine
gave
a
little
sob
and
turning
ran
from
the
room
leaving
him
with
his
proud
head
bent
and
tears
in
his
dark
blue
eyes
and
she
made
herself
return
to
her
work
nor
would
she
permit
her
thoughts
to
dwell
for
an
instant
upon
the
events
of
the
morning
or
the
words
of
the
duke
for
she
knew
that
if
she
did
so
she
would
lose
control
of
herself
and
foolishly
burst
into
tears
and
there
was
lunch
to
be
endured
and
the
afternoon
and
evening
so
this
was
the
end
he
loved
her
but
his
ideas
of
principle
and
if
she
was
only
a
common
girl
and
so
debarred
from
being
a
duchess
the
duke
should
see
that
no
aristocrat
of
his
own
class
could
be
more
game
lady
garribardine
found
her
still
writing
diligently
when
she
came
in
just
before
luncheon
would
be
announced
and
she
wondered
what
made
the
girl
look
so
pale
it
is
quite
too
bad
that
you
have
sat
here
all
this
time
she
exclaimed
i
wo
have
you
bother
with
another
word
this
was
to
be
your
holiday
and
your
amusement
this
visit
to
valfreyne
and
you
have
been
cooped
up
in
the
house
working
as
if
at
home
the
duke
looked
extremely
stern
at
luncheon
and
was
punctiliously
polite
to
everyone
but
those
in
his
immediate
vicinity
were
conscious
that
a
stiffness
had
fallen
upon
the
atmosphere
which
asphyxiated
conversation
lady
garribardine
was
well
acquainted
with
the
signs
of
all
his
moods
this
one
she
knew
resulted
from
pain
of
some
sort
and
mental
perturbation
what
had
occurred
between
him
and
katherine
could
they
have
quarrelled
this
must
be
ascertained
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
after
luncheon
they
were
all
to
motor
to
an
old
castle
for
a
picnic
tea
a
beautiful
ruin
of
a
former
habitation
of
the
monluces
about
five
miles
away
katherine
should
go
with
the
younger
people
and
she
should
have
the
duke
to
herself
his
manner
was
certainly
preoccupied
and
he
spoke
only
of
ordinary
things
as
they
went
through
the
park
the
party
has
been
the
greatest
success
mordryn
are
you
pleased
everyone
has
enjoyed
it
yes
i
suppose
it
has
been
all
right
thanks
to
your
admirable
qualities
as
hostess
dear
friend
but
how
irksome
i
find
all
parties
i
have
been
too
long
away
from
the
world
i
thought
you
seemed
so
cheery
mordryn
yesterday
but
you
look
as
glum
as
a
church
you
must
shake
yourself
up
nothing
is
so
foolish
as
giving
way
to
these
acquired
habits
of
solitude
and
separation
from
your
kind
i
am
growing
old
seraphim
stuff
and
nonsense
her
ladyship
cried
you
have
never
looked
more
vigorous
or
more
attractive
and
you
are
not
subject
to
liver
attacks
or
the
gout
so
you
have
no
excuse
in
the
world
for
this
doleful
point
of
view
perhaps
not
it
is
stupid
to
want
the
moon
there
are
no
such
things
as
moons
for
dukes
they
are
always
lamps
which
can
be
secured
in
the
hand
not
without
fear
of
combustion
or
fusing
as
the
case
might
be
nothing
venture
nothing
have
no
man
ought
to
sit
down
and
abandon
his
moon
chase
if
he
wants
it
badly
enough
he
will
get
it
in
spite
of
his
conscience
her
ladyship
looked
at
him
shrewdly
now
was
a
moment
for
indicating
her
sentiments
she
felt
he
might
understand
her
as
he
so
pleased
no
never
in
spite
of
his
conscience
but
in
spite
of
custom
or
tradition
or
any
other
barrier
but
although
the
duke
found
much
comfort
in
her
words
he
was
not
easily
influenced
by
anyone
and
the
torrent
of
his
passion
had
not
yet
reached
the
floodgates
and
was
restrained
by
his
will
so
he
turned
the
conversation
and
endeavoured
to
be
cheerful
and
seraphim
saw
that
for
the
moment
she
must
leave
things
to
fate
katherine
looked
quite
lovely
at
tea
her
new
air
of
rather
pensive
gentleness
suited
her
well
she
showed
perfect
composure
there
was
no
trace
of
nervousness
or
in
her
manner
only
her
eyes
were
sad
what
dignity
the
duke
thought
as
he
watched
her
conduct
and
attitude
during
the
whole
visit
had
shown
he
knew
it
must
have
been
a
moment
of
exceptional
excitement
to
her
to
come
there
among
his
and
lady
garribardine
friends
as
one
of
them
and
yet
not
for
a
second
had
she
shown
anything
but
composure
and
ease
talking
with
quiet
politeness
to
whoever
addressed
her
neither
with
subservience
nor
with
expansiveness
but
with
exactly
the
consideration
which
so
becomes
a
great
lady
even
if
she
is
but
a
girl
he
looked
at
her
again
and
again
and
could
find
only
something
further
to
respect
and
admire
he
wondered
how
much
she
was
feeling
what
had
that
little
sob
meant
pain
as
well
as
understanding
assuredly
was
she
too
longing
secretly
to
be
taken
into
his
arms
as
with
every
fibre
of
his
being
he
was
burning
with
desire
to
hold
her
or
did
she
not
really
care
and
was
the
attention
of
young
westonborough
enough
to
divert
her
and
would
she
eventually
marry
sir
john
this
last
thought
was
disgusting
but
his
grace
of
mordryn
had
not
the
type
of
mind
like
that
of
gerard
strobridge
to
take
comfort
in
the
thought
that
if
she
did
so
his
own
chance
of
future
joy
would
be
the
greater
no
touch
of
anything
but
reverence
was
in
his
heart
towards
katherine
and
so
the
afternoon
passed
with
much
suffering
in
two
souls
and
the
rainbow
tints
of
the
evening
came
over
the
sky
the
chestnut
trees
were
the
softest
fresh
green
and
the
oaks
only
just
out
copper
beeches
and
limes
and
firs
all
added
to
the
beauty
of
tint
and
young
birds
were
twittering
their
the
whole
world
was
full
of
love
and
springtime
promise
of
joy
and
mordryn
battled
with
himself
and
banished
temptation
and
had
his
blinds
drawn
immediately
to
hide
all
these
sweet
things
of
nature
when
they
returned
and
stayed
alone
there
until
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
saying
he
had
important
letters
to
write
but
all
the
while
he
was
conscious
that
just
beyond
that
door
and
that
passage
there
was
a
woman
who
seemed
to
matter
to
him
more
than
anything
else
in
life
the
whole
afternoon
had
been
such
a
wretched
tantalization
a
long
duty
when
he
had
spoken
as
an
automaton
to
boring
guests
he
had
not
sought
to
talk
to
katherine
that
in
the
morning
had
been
final
there
could
be
no
anticlimax
that
would
make
it
all
futile
and
she
had
she
had
realised
his
motive
this
he
knew
and
felt
but
took
no
comfort
from
the
thought
and
katherine
with
half
an
hour
to
herself
looked
for
and
found
that
passage
on
page
of
abelard
and
h√©loise
and
she
read
i
remove
to
a
distance
from
your
person
with
an
intention
of
avoiding
you
as
an
enemy
and
yet
i
incessantly
seek
for
you
in
my
mind
i
recall
your
image
in
my
memory
and
in
such
different
disquietudes
i
betray
and
contradict
i
hate
you
i
love
you
shame
presses
me
on
all
sides
i
am
at
this
moment
afraid
i
should
seem
more
indifferent
than
you
are
and
yet
i
am
ashamed
to
discover
my
trouble
well
if
he
felt
like
that
what
could
be
the
end
chapter
xxxi
london
seemed
very
noisy
and
tumultuous
to
katherine
when
they
returned
to
berkeley
square
and
the
routine
of
her
work
came
almost
as
a
relief
what
would
be
the
outcome
of
this
visit
to
valfreyne
she
could
not
guess
that
the
duke
loved
her
she
knew
but
with
what
kind
of
love
with
an
almighty
passion
which
one
day
would
break
all
barriers
and
seek
for
fulfilment
or
with
a
restrained
emotion
which
when
the
temptation
of
her
presence
was
removed
would
settle
down
but
of
what
matter
really
whether
he
loved
her
with
the
one
or
the
other
since
both
were
equally
forbidden
and
useless
and
she
what
were
her
feelings
she
knew
in
her
heart
that
if
she
were
to
permit
herself
to
indulge
in
natural
emotion
she
could
shower
upon
him
a
love
that
in
its
white
heat
of
devotion
and
passion
would
make
that
which
she
had
formerly
given
to
lord
algy
appear
but
a
puny
schoolgirl
thing
she
must
not
give
way
to
any
such
feelings
though
the
pain
was
quite
bitter
enough
as
it
was
and
nothing
but
stern
discipline
of
mind
and
an
iron
could
make
it
bearable
at
all
she
felt
restless
during
that
week
on
tenterhooks
to
know
if
she
should
see
the
duke
hot
and
cold
as
she
went
into
a
room
but
he
did
not
come
and
she
heard
casually
that
he
was
still
at
valfreyne
and
on
saturday
morning
they
went
down
to
blissington
until
the
monday
afternoon
as
was
their
custom
at
each
lady
garribardine
watched
katherine
critically
and
knew
that
she
was
suffering
and
so
she
was
unusually
kind
and
witty
and
sarcastic
and
acted
as
a
tonic
she
had
a
shrewd
way
of
looking
at
men
and
things
which
always
delighted
katherine
and
they
seemed
to
grow
closer
friends
than
ever
you
are
a
great
comfort
to
me
girl
she
said
i
can
talk
to
you
and
air
all
my
notions
as
i
could
to
a
man
and
you
do
not
answer
upon
another
subject
for
you
know
my
dear
that
if
the
basis
of
your
argument
with
nine
women
out
of
ten
happens
to
be
that
the
sea
is
salt
they
will
reply
that
on
the
contrary
the
moon
is
made
of
green
cheese
you
mildly
protest
that
it
is
the
taste
of
the
sea
not
the
composition
of
the
moon
which
is
in
question
and
then
they
say
they
totally
disagree
with
you
and
that
the
sun
is
warm
you
are
done
there
is
nothing
left
for
you
but
to
smile
and
talk
of
clothes
katherine
laughed
delightedly
how
well
she
knew
this
style
of
argument
matilda
had
always
practised
it
i
believe
i
owe
to
my
dear
lady
the
faculty
of
seeing
a
little
differently
not
at
all
you
always
were
as
sharp
as
a
needle
i
may
merely
have
encouraged
you
perhaps
it
is
through
your
kindness
and
sympathy
that
i
have
emerged
and
broken
away
from
the
stultifying
bonds
of
my
class
oh
if
you
only
knew
how
deep
is
my
gratitude
she
was
very
seldom
moved
like
this
and
lady
garribardine
looked
at
her
closely
tut
tut
child
you
were
made
for
great
things
and
it
is
because
i
realised
this
at
once
almost
that
i
have
sympathised
with
you
i
could
not
have
kept
you
back
any
more
than
i
could
have
created
qualities
in
you
i
could
merely
have
delayed
your
upward
progress
or
as
i
hope
i
have
done
advanced
it
the
spirit
in
you
is
and
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
katherine
eyes
softened
with
love
and
reverence
her
dear
dear
friend
and
benefactress
when
she
was
alone
lady
garribardine
thought
deeply
over
everything
their
respect
and
affection
were
mutual
it
troubled
her
a
little
to
see
the
girl
so
quiet
mordryn
had
played
quite
fairly
she
hoped
but
yes
he
could
never
do
otherwise
she
guessed
what
was
the
reason
of
the
estrangement
if
estrangement
there
was
on
his
side
and
it
caused
her
no
permanent
concern
when
a
man
feels
as
mordryn
feels
no
class
prejudice
in
the
world
will
keep
him
from
the
woman
in
the
end
only
let
him
suffer
enough
and
then
give
them
an
opportunity
to
meet
and
all
will
be
well
thus
she
mused
and
what
a
weight
off
her
mind
it
would
be
to
see
them
happily
married
so
that
her
conscience
might
be
at
rest
and
she
could
feel
that
she
had
more
than
made
up
for
her
action
of
long
ago
yes
katherine
bush
was
a
peerless
creature
and
would
be
the
brightest
jewel
in
any
crown
not
a
trace
of
the
jealousy
or
antagonism
which
once
or
twice
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
had
sprung
up
from
natural
hereditary
instinct
and
class
prejudice
remained
in
her
heart
her
clear
and
wise
judgment
had
sifted
and
weighed
all
the
pros
and
cons
no
two
human
beings
on
earth
were
more
suited
to
one
another
than
her
humble
secretary
from
bindon
green
and
this
great
nobleman
and
she
could
launch
katherine
successfully
and
make
her
accepted
without
question
and
after
the
marriage
she
could
safely
leave
to
the
own
superb
tact
and
common
sense
the
task
of
maintaining
the
position
of
duchess
with
illustrious
distinction
so
that
the
only
barrier
left
to
be
overcome
was
mordryn
tiresome
prejudice
about
class
that
most
annoyingly
obstinate
sense
of
duty
and
duty
to
his
rank
and
to
his
race
but
his
mind
was
not
narrow
and
once
he
could
have
time
freely
to
think
out
what
real
nobility
meant
he
would
realise
that
highness
of
birth
was
not
essential
at
all
lady
garribardine
knew
the
duke
nature
so
well
she
was
aware
that
if
she
spoke
to
him
upon
this
subject
and
sought
to
influence
him
more
than
her
speech
at
the
picnic
had
already
done
his
desire
being
so
forcibly
upon
her
side
he
would
then
still
more
determinedly
make
up
his
mind
not
to
be
convinced
from
the
fear
that
he
was
allowing
inclination
to
weaken
his
sense
of
duty
to
leave
fate
to
manage
matters
was
the
best
plan
and
to
be
ready
to
give
a
helping
hand
at
the
critical
moment
mordryn
was
certainly
suffering
deeply
or
he
would
have
returned
to
london
instead
of
staying
on
at
valfreyne
not
by
word
or
insinuation
did
she
ever
indicate
to
katherine
that
she
had
remarked
the
duke
interest
in
her
or
the
apparent
cooling
of
it
indeed
since
that
day
at
the
easter
party
when
she
had
lightly
spoken
of
his
coming
to
the
schoolroom
she
had
never
mentioned
him
to
her
secretary
in
connection
with
herself
at
all
so
on
the
surface
everything
was
calm
and
peaceful
and
life
flowed
in
its
accustomed
stream
mordryn
must
be
made
to
come
to
berkeley
square
again
as
of
old
and
he
must
not
be
allowed
to
see
katherine
for
some
time
he
must
get
into
the
way
of
dropping
in
as
usual
without
fear
and
in
the
third
week
after
whitsuntide
the
duke
returned
to
town
and
did
dine
there
and
miss
bush
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
he
had
spent
very
miserable
days
down
in
his
beautiful
home
he
had
not
reached
the
stage
of
reason
yet
he
was
merely
fighting
desire
with
all
his
might
while
daily
it
grew
stronger
how
cold
her
hand
had
been
when
they
had
said
a
polite
on
the
tuesday
morning
he
could
feel
it
through
the
glove
how
pale
her
face
had
looked
too
he
hoped
to
god
she
was
not
suffering
that
would
be
too
cruel
and
he
could
not
feel
guiltless
if
it
were
so
he
had
certainly
played
upon
her
feelings
although
in
the
most
subtle
manner
which
made
his
conduct
the
more
cowardly
and
inexcusable
this
thought
brought
extreme
discomfort
and
plunged
him
into
frantic
work
he
filled
all
his
hours
with
the
business
of
his
estate
in
order
to
banish
memory
but
with
no
great
success
so
at
last
he
came
up
to
london
determined
to
crush
out
every
weakness
but
when
he
went
to
berkeley
square
to
dine
he
felt
agitated
and
he
knew
that
he
was
fearing
and
yet
hoping
to
see
katherine
but
he
caught
no
glimpse
of
her
nor
was
she
even
mentioned
it
was
as
though
she
had
never
been
he
grew
anxious
had
she
left
service
this
must
be
ascertained
immediately
before
he
left
the
house
miss
bush
is
not
dining
seraphim
he
said
after
dinner
when
he
had
a
moment
with
his
hostess
i
hope
she
is
well
yes
thanks
and
her
ladyship
turned
the
conversation
at
once
so
that
he
was
left
with
this
meagre
information
as
he
drove
away
to
james
he
found
himself
thinking
incessantly
of
the
girl
she
had
understood
she
was
so
fine
she
had
grasped
the
situation
completely
had
she
not
herself
explained
to
him
the
duty
he
owed
to
his
race
but
a
woman
who
could
take
such
an
abstract
view
must
surely
have
a
very
wonderful
soul
every
one
of
her
ideas
had
shown
the
highest
sense
of
duty
the
most
profound
grasp
of
what
was
meant
by
he
remembered
even
her
remark
about
his
attending
the
house
of
lords
how
she
had
said
it
was
cowardly
of
him
to
shirk
his
work
there
just
because
he
so
despised
modern
views
in
what
high
esteem
too
she
was
held
by
seraphim
a
woman
not
to
be
imposed
upon
by
any
mere
charm
and
one
who
would
bring
the
most
critical
judgment
to
bear
upon
every
question
before
she
would
accord
her
and
that
katherine
had
lady
garribardine
friendship
in
full
he
knew
he
went
into
his
library
which
looked
out
on
the
green
park
and
he
opened
the
window
side
and
walked
on
to
the
terrace
in
the
distance
the
roar
of
piccadilly
thundered
by
but
his
immediate
neighbourhood
was
quiet
and
he
could
think
he
reviewed
every
minute
incident
from
the
beginning
of
his
acquaintance
with
katherine
that
night
not
so
very
long
ago
at
the
house
of
gerard
strobridge
she
had
admitted
that
it
was
she
herself
who
had
desired
this
meeting
after
she
had
heard
him
speak
that
proved
that
she
had
been
drawn
to
him
even
then
and
how
attractive
she
had
appeared
how
cultivated
and
polished
how
clever
and
refined
and
to
think
that
such
achievement
was
the
result
of
steadfastness
of
purpose
a
will
to
compass
an
ideal
against
extraordinary
odds
an
intelligence
great
enough
to
realise
that
facts
alone
count
and
that
no
assumption
of
the
rights
of
ladyhood
or
demonstration
in
words
would
convince
anyone
but
only
the
inward
reality
of
fineness
of
soul
directing
outward
action
how
much
more
meritorious
and
to
be
respected
was
her
achievement
then
than
if
these
things
had
been
her
natural
heritage
she
had
obtained
a
state
of
perfection
through
deliberate
intention
in
a
far
greater
degree
than
anyone
he
knew
but
seraphim
her
every
idea
thought
expression
and
point
of
view
accorded
exactly
with
his
own
her
sense
of
duty
was
paramount
her
and
her
common
sense
and
her
balance
were
such
as
he
had
never
before
seen
in
woman
and
she
was
young
and
beautiful
and
in
perfect
health
no
nervous
fancies
beset
that
evenly
poised
brain
suddenly
as
he
stared
up
into
the
deep
blue
starlit
sky
it
seemed
that
the
scales
fell
from
his
eyes
and
fog
was
lifted
from
his
inner
vision
of
the
soul
this
beloved
creature
daughter
of
an
auctioneer
and
granddaughter
of
a
butcher
was
truly
and
really
an
aristocrat
in
the
purest
and
truest
sense
of
the
term
and
just
because
he
could
trace
his
pedigree
back
for
countless
generations
who
was
he
to
stand
aside
and
not
give
her
her
due
when
her
spirit
and
character
were
so
infinitely
above
him
thus
love
engenders
humility
in
noble
hearts
where
in
the
whole
world
could
he
find
one
so
worthy
to
share
his
great
name
and
great
estate
he
laughed
aloud
in
glee
it
would
not
be
giving
way
to
temptation
for
personal
joy
to
think
of
her
as
his
duchess
but
it
would
be
conferring
the
greatest
honour
upon
his
house
that
it
had
ever
known
he
marvelled
at
his
blindness
marvelled
at
his
pitifully
conventional
point
of
view
how
had
it
ever
weighed
with
him
a
second
how
had
he
not
realised
at
once
the
utter
paltriness
of
the
designation
of
aristocrat
unless
the
inner
being
carries
out
what
that
word
is
intended
to
convey
he
thought
of
his
wife
laura
with
her
stupid
mean
little
brain
developing
into
madness
he
thought
of
gerard
wife
beatrice
of
what
use
was
she
to
any
man
he
thought
of
his
own
cousin
dulcie
dashington
with
her
vulgar
barmaid
instincts
and
her
degradation
of
her
great
state
and
he
thought
of
all
the
crew
of
frivolous
soulless
mindless
worldlings
who
had
flung
themselves
at
his
head
at
blissington
any
one
of
whom
society
would
call
a
lady
suitable
for
him
to
marry
and
take
to
his
home
and
then
he
thought
of
katherine
simple
dignity
she
had
not
tried
to
entrap
him
she
had
not
been
insulted
at
his
holding
back
she
had
understood
in
her
humility
of
greatness
she
had
what
would
be
likely
to
be
his
view
or
rather
the
view
of
his
class
but
now
he
saw
the
truth
and
the
truth
was
that
she
stood
out
a
star
among
womankind
and
none
other
was
worthy
to
tie
the
latchet
of
her
shoe
he
would
not
hesitate
another
second
he
would
telephone
in
the
morning
to
seraphim
and
propose
himself
for
saturday
and
then
he
should
see
her
this
sweet
katherine
and
talk
to
her
and
tell
her
the
truth
and
if
she
would
so
honour
him
then
she
should
be
his
own
the
vision
exalted
him
he
let
his
imagination
curbed
and
denied
expression
for
so
long
have
full
rein
she
was
not
cold
by
nature
she
would
not
have
to
simulate
passion
like
julia
scarrisbrooke
hers
if
she
felt
it
at
all
would
be
real
she
had
experienced
that
part
of
love
before
he
even
thought
of
this
without
a
pang
for
that
was
past
and
something
told
him
that
she
was
not
indifferent
to
him
now
how
enchanting
to
make
her
really
love
him
how
divine
to
teach
her
all
the
shades
of
that
something
beyond
which
she
had
asked
him
about
and
then
their
life
together
there
at
valfreyne
yes
this
was
the
true
kind
of
strength
which
she
had
spoken
of
the
strength
which
breaks
down
all
shams
and
to
think
how
near
he
had
been
to
allowing
the
stupid
blind
hypocritical
ideas
of
his
world
to
part
them
forever
he
must
have
been
mad
since
he
had
known
her
worth
always
from
the
first
day
seraphim
would
help
him
after
all
had
she
not
told
him
not
to
go
against
his
conscience
but
only
against
custom
and
tradition
and
any
other
barrier
and
now
conscience
was
with
him
and
he
would
break
every
bar
which
divided
him
from
his
heart
delight
lady
garribardine
surprise
was
great
on
receiving
the
telephone
message
in
the
morning
might
his
grace
speak
to
her
ladyship
personally
katherine
repeated
the
message
of
the
servant
certainly
his
grace
might
katherine
handed
the
receiver
and
was
preparing
to
leave
the
room
but
lady
garribardine
made
a
sign
for
her
to
stay
while
she
sat
up
in
bed
is
that
you
mordryn
oh
why
of
course
you
may
come
down
yes
london
is
hot
it
will
only
be
a
dull
party
gwendoline
and
the
colvins
and
old
tom
hawthorne
i
was
merely
going
for
rest
myself
you
do
mind
you
would
like
that
oh
very
well
come
either
by
motor
or
the
three
train
all
right
then
she
looked
at
katherine
who
met
her
eyes
with
a
perfectly
unmoved
face
the
duke
proposes
himself
to
come
to
us
at
blissington
he
is
bored
with
london
and
out
of
sorts
but
no
joy
appeared
on
the
secretary
countenance
in
fact
she
turned
a
shade
paler
as
she
asked
if
she
should
transmit
any
orders
to
the
housekeeper
about
his
room
she
feels
things
like
the
devil
her
ladyship
thought
but
mordryn
has
evidently
come
to
his
senses
so
they
will
presently
settle
the
matter
all
right
katherine
was
glad
that
her
duties
now
took
her
out
shopping
she
felt
she
must
be
in
the
open
air
and
free
to
think
what
did
this
mean
why
was
he
coming
to
blissington
so
suddenly
would
it
produce
a
climax
in
her
fate
and
as
mordryn
had
done
the
night
before
on
his
terrace
overlooking
the
green
park
so
she
too
reviewed
all
their
acquaintance
and
what
it
had
grown
to
mean
to
her
something
very
bitter
sweet
should
she
allow
herself
a
fool
paradise
for
just
a
day
should
she
let
him
make
love
to
her
if
that
was
his
intention
in
coming
to
blissington
but
no
she
must
be
firm
with
herself
and
act
always
as
she
thought
right
but
her
mind
was
in
a
turmoil
and
she
felt
tired
and
excited
the
picture
held
out
nothing
but
pain
if
he
came
and
made
love
to
her
she
would
have
to
cut
his
protestations
short
and
if
he
ignored
her
that
would
hurt
still
more
she
devoutly
wished
she
might
run
away
at
luncheon
the
next
day
after
their
arrival
at
blissington
her
ladyship
said
rather
irrelevantly
you
look
thoroughly
tired
out
girl
i
advise
you
to
take
a
rug
and
a
book
and
go
out
under
the
chestnut
trees
in
the
beautiful
air
and
have
a
nap
and
do
come
in
for
tea
if
you
do
not
want
to
there
are
so
few
of
us
i
can
manage
by
myself
and
katherine
glad
to
escape

as
she
was
bid
chapter
xxxii
when
the
duke
arrived
by
motor
tea
had
just
been
brought
out
on
the
terrace
at
the
eastern
side
of
the
house
his
glance
travelled
rapidly
over
the
group
miss
bush
was
not
present
his
impatience
had
been
growing
and
growing
ever
since
the
thursday
night
when
his
resolution
had
been
taken
and
now
he
almost
felt
like
a
boy
in
his
great
disappointment
at
noting
katherine
absence
how
was
he
going
to
talk
to
the
colvins
and
tom
hawthorne
and
old
gwendoline
however
he
did
manage
to
be
almost
his
usual
self
though
lady
garribardine
was
quite
aware
that
his
nerves
were
strung
to
a
high
tension
she
got
through
tea
as
quickly
as
possible
and
then
walked
him
off
to
see
a
new
set
of
herbaceous
borders
the
very
second
that
they
were
alone
mordryn
began
to
talk
openly
to
her
he
had
determined
to
have
no
further
cross
purposes
of
any
kind
do
you
guess
seraphim
what
has
brought
me
here
he
asked
i
have
some
shrewd
idea
you
have
decided
to
appreciate
reality
and
discard
appearance
as
my
katherine
bush
would
say
that
is
it
have
i
your
sympathy
dear
friend
my
warmest
sympathy
mordryn
your
happiness
means
a
very
great
deal
to
me
i
have
had
some
horrible
moments
in
those
past
years
of
remorse
for
my
part
in
your
sorrows
but
if
you
secure
this
girl
i
can
feel
that
you
will
be
amply
compensated
i
am
deeply
in
love
seraphim
and
you
i
know
will
not
laugh
at
me
or
think
it
absurd
she
gave
him
a
frank
smile
full
of
affection
indeed
no
and
what
is
more
important
the
girl
will
not
laugh
either
she
is
full
of
passion
mordryn
have
you
ever
watched
her
little
nostrils
quiver
you
will
have
no
colourless
time
with
her
she
is
not
of
the
type
of
poor
l√§o
delemar
gerard
friend
or
julia
scarrisbrooke
the
fierce
red
blood
rushes
through
her
veins
but
she
is
too
entirely
to
let
even
me
see
what
her
real
feelings
are
though
i
shrewdly
suspect
she
is
in
love
with
you
you
the
man
mordryn
and
not
strange
to
say
the
dukedom
at
all
his
grace
thrilled
with
delight
as
why
not
indeed
of
all
beautiful
and
maligned
things
he
knew
real
passion
was
the
rarest
if
it
had
been
the
dukedom
she
could
have
tantalized
me
into
committing
any
madness
weeks
ago
but
she
has
done
nothing
of
the
sort
she
has
simply
that
is
the
wonderful
part
she
is
an
amazing
creature
a
wonderful
character
old
friend
perfectly
honest
and
intensely
proud
not
with
the
pride
which
sticks
its
chin
in
the
air
but
that
which
carries
the
head
high
there
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
the
two
upstarts
nearly
always
have
their
chins
in
the
air
but
are
unacquainted
with
the
other
attitude
she
will
make
the
most
perfect
duchess
your
house
has
ever
known
and
think
of
your
children
the
duke
drew
in
his
breath
sharply
a
new
joy
permeated
him
at
her
words
just
think
of
your
children
why
my
dream
of
the
six
sturdy
boys
may
yet
come
true
seraphim
really
her
ladyship
chuckled
happily
now
we
must
use
common
sense
there
must
not
be
a
flaw
in
the
whole
affair
if
she
agrees
to
marry
you
i
will
begin
to
arrange
the
situation
at
once
i
will
bring
her
out
more
and
present
her
to
people
and
we
will
not
announce
the
engagement
for
a
few
weeks
no
one
will
dare
to
question
who
she
is
or
where
she
came
from
if
i
choose
to
do
that
some
of
them
may
even
suggest
that
she
is
the
result
of
some
past
indiscretion
of
one
of
the
family
that
i
have
adopted
they
may
think
what
they
like
she
is
so
absolutely
honest
she
would
tell
anyone
the
truth
herself
without
a
care
but
i
think
i
shall
advise
her
to
be
silent
and
let
people
make
up
what
they
please
no
one
can
dispute
her
perfect
refinement
or
suitability
to
take
any
position
in
the
world
seraphim
you
are
an
angel
no
i
am
not
i
am
merely
a
capable
craftsman
i
like
to
do
everything
i
undertake
well
your
duchess
shall
start
unhandicapped
how
deep
is
my
gratitude
dear
friend
tut
tut
but
her
dark
eyes
beamed
mistily
when
i
see
you
safely
off
with
the
knot
tied
on
your
way
to
valfreyne
for
the
honeymoon
i
shall
feel
content
where
is
she
i
told
her
to
go
and
rest
under
the
chestnuts
this
afternoon
she
looked
as
pale
as
a
ghost
may
i
find
her
there
then
now
yes
be
off
and
bless
you
they
wrung
hands
and
the
duke
strode
away
looking
as
her
ladyship
admitted
with
a
fond
still
the
hero
of
any
woman
dream
his
years
sat
so
lightly
upon
him
but
he
searched
under
the
chestnuts
and
beyond
and
katherine
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
a
rug
was
folded
beneath
one
great
trunk
she
had
evidently
been
there
and
had
now
wandered
on
and
perhaps
was
not
far
off
he
continued
his
search
for
some
time
without
success
and
when
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
near
woods
with
their
beautiful
paths
some
of
which
ran
down
to
a
bit
of
ornamental
water
just
big
enough
to
be
called
a
lake
he
stopped
puzzled
as
to
which
one
to
follow
his
heart
was
beating
as
it
had
not
beat
for
years
he
decided
to
go
straight
to
the
water
edge
to
a
chinese
which
was
there
and
when
he
came
at
length
in
sight
of
this
he
perceived
the
flutter
of
a
grey
linen
skirt
disappearing
round
the
corner
of
it
on
the
verandah
which
overhung
the
water
there
were
great
white
water
lilies
growing
in
masses
just
beneath
while
two
stately
swans
swam
about
in
the
distance
the
sun
was
sinking
it
was
past
six
and
the
lights
were
very
lovely
and
all
was
serene
and
still
his
footfalls
did
not
sound
on
the
soft
turf
and
katherine
did
not
know
of
his
approach
until
he
actually
stood
before
her
on
the
broad
verandah
step
she
was
leaning
against
the
balustrade
gazing
out
over
the
lake
and
she
turned
and
caught
sight
of
him
he
came
forward
with
outstretched
hands
his
face
aglow
so
i
have
found
you
at
last
he
cried
gladly
what
made
you
hide
away
here
all
alone
katherine
controlled
herself
sternly
she
shook
hands
calmly
saying
it
was
cool
by
the
water
and
a
pleasant
place
to
be
solitude
is
good
sometimes
she
had
felt
too
restless
to
stay
beneath
the
trees
even
her
will
could
not
keep
her
disturbed
thoughts
from
speculation
as
to
what
the
day
might
bring
and
now
the
duke
was
here
beside
her
and
the
situation
must
be
faced
he
came
close
and
leaned
upon
the
quaint
wooden
rails
trying
to
look
down
into
her
averted
face
while
he
whispered
i
had
rather
enjoy
a
√†
he
saw
that
she
was
pale
and
that
her
manner
was
restrained
did
she
possibly
misunderstand
the
purpose
of
his
coming
look
and
she
pointed
over
to
the
swans
they
perhaps
agree
with
you
they
swim
lazily
about
together
dignified
and
composed
far
from
turmoil
and
agitating
currents
one
envies
the
birds
and
beasts
and
fishes
sometimes
and
she
sighed
you
must
not
sigh
look
at
me
katherine
i
want
to
see
your
eyes
but
she
disobeyed
him
and
turned
the
broad
lids
down
he
leaned
closer
still
and
this
caused
a
wave
of
emotion
to
sweep
over
her
producing
the
same
feeling
which
she
had
once
thought
only
lord
algy
in
all
the
world
could
evoke
in
her
so
that
the
duke
saw
those
little
nostrils
quiver
which
his
friend
seraphim
had
spoken
to
him
about
and
the
sight
gave
him
great
joy
look
at
me
katherine
and
now
his
voice
was
full
of
command
then
she
slowly
raised
her
eyes
and
he
saw
that
they
were
troubled
in
spite
of
the
passion
that
lay
in
their
depths
why
do
you
come
here
and
speak
to
me
like
this
and
in
her
voice
there
was
reproach
we
said
farewell
at
valfreyne
that
was
the
end
i
understood
why
do
you
come
again
to
trouble
me
now
because
i
could
not
keep
away
because
i
love
you
darling
child
she
drew
back
shivering
with
the
pain
of
the
struggle
which
was
developing
in
her
soul
hush
you
must
not
say
that
to
me
i
ask
you
not
to
please
but
since
coldness
and
repulsion
were
not
what
he
read
in
her
glance
her
words
did
not
discourage
him
i
was
very
foolish
at
valfreyne
katherine
ever
to
have
said
farewell
but
now
i
have
come
here
to
blissington
to
tell
you
that
i
love
you
passionately
my
darling
and
your
dear
sympathy
and
understanding
saw
into
my
mind
and
grasped
the
prejudices
therein
but
now
the
blindness
has
fallen
from
my
eyes
i
adore
you
my
beloved
one
katherine
i
want
you
to
be
my
wife
his
voice
had
never
been
more
beautiful
his
splendid
presence
had
never
appeared
more
impressive
nor
the
fascination
of
the
man
more
supreme
and
he
was
there
a
suppliant
before
her
asking
her
to
be
his
wife
for
a
few
seconds
her
brain
reeled
the
summit
of
her
ambition
was
reached
and
not
ambition
alone
but
what
now
seemed
to
matter
more
the
realisation
of
true
love
both
were
there
for
her
to
take
and
to
enjoy
the
fateful
moment
had
come
she
was
face
to
face
with
the
great
problem
of
her
life
how
could
she
relinquish
all
this
glory
just
to
keep
faith
with
her
ideal
of
right
she
looked
up
into
his
proud
face
and
saw
it
transfigured
with
worship
and
she
gave
a
little
cry
no
she
could
never
deceive
him
he
was
far
too
fine
for
that
whatever
came
between
them
there
should
be
only
truth
but
even
so
a
flood
of
passionate
emotion
burst
all
bonds
the
whole
deep
currents
of
her
nature
were
stirred
and
must
find
vent
before
the
final
renunciation
ah
she
cried
and
let
herself
be
clasped
in
his
embrace
then
i
love
you
i
love
you
she
went
on
kiss
me
hold
me
let
me
feel
what
it
is
like
to
be
there
next
your
heart
what
it
would
mean
what
it
mean
if
it
might
only
oh
you
do
not
know
what
it
costs
really
to
say
do
you
remember
once
when
i
told
you
that
i
knew
one
side
of
love
and
asked
you
if
there
was
not
something
beyond
well
i
know
now
that
there
is
you
have
taught
me
to
feel
it
it
is
the
soul
victory
i
love
you
with
everything
in
me
with
my
body
and
my
spirit
and
my
life
but
she
could
articulate
no
further
for
the
duke
intoxicated
with
emotion
strained
her
to
his
heart
bruising
her
lips
with
kisses
which
seemed
to
transport
them
both
to
paradise
here
was
no
timid
lover
but
one
with
a
nature
as
fiercely
passionate
as
her
own
ah
god
how
divine
and
he
sighed
when
at
last
after
long
blissful
seconds
his
lips
left
hers
katherine
how
dare
you
talk
such
folly
to
me
of
bidding
me
you
shall
never
leave
me
again
you
are
absolutely
mine
hush
and
she
put
her
hand
over
his
mouth
tenderly
while
she
drew
herself
out
of
his
arms
as
far
as
love
goes
i
am
indeed
all
yours
the
mightiness
of
this
passion
has
swept
away
all
other
thoughts
but
now
you
will
have
to
listen
to
me
and
you
must
not
speak
until
the
see
let
us
sit
here
for
the
story
is
long
just
to
humour
her
he
allowed
her
to
draw
him
to
the
seat
and
with
eyes
devouring
her
with
fond
impatience
he
waited
for
her
to
begin
promise
that
you
will
not
interrupt
me
until
i
have
finished
no
matter
what
you
may
feel
or
think
he
gave
his
word
quite
gaily
and
took
and
held
her
hand
katherine
controlled
her
every
nerve
now
and
told
the
story
in
a
deep
quiet
voice
with
no
dramatic
gestures
drawing
a
graphic
picture
of
her
home
and
of
the
office
at
liv
and
dev
and
the
effect
upon
her
of
the
voices
of
the
gentlemen
who
came
to
borrow
money
and
then
she
told
of
the
coming
of
lord
algy
and
of
their
acquaintance
and
then
she
paused
for
a
second
and
glanced
at
mordryn
face
it
had
grown
a
little
strained
but
he
grasped
more
tightly
her
hand
now
you
must
listen
very
carefully
and
try
to
understand
i
suppose
i
must
have
been
in
love
with
him
in
a
passionate
kind
of
way
he
was
so
very
handsome
and
gay
and
full
of
charm
well
i
decided
to
go
away
with
him
for
three
days
i
decided
deliberately
not
so
much
from
love
as
because
i
wanted
to
understand
life
and
to
know
the
nature
of
men
and
the
point
of
view
of
an
aristocrat
the
duke
face
became
ashen
white
and
his
hand
turned
icy
cold
but
he
did
not
speak
so
with
a
little
break
in
her
voice
katherine
went
on
well
we
went
to
paris
on
the
saturday
and
came
back
on
the
monday
night
by
that
time
i
knew
all
the
passionate
side
of
love
he
aroused
all
those
instincts
in
me
which
i
once
told
you
about
but
he
never
touched
my
soul
that
slept
until
you
i
never
meant
to
stay
with
him
or
remain
his
mistress
it
was
for
experience
and
that
was
all
and
we
parted
at
charing
cross
station
and
he
went
to
wales
to
his
family
to
shoot
and
i
went
home
i
wrote
to
him
and
told
him
that
i
would
not
see
him
again
then
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
leave
livingstone
devereux
and
begin
my
next
rise
in
the
world
oh
you
do
not
know
how
ignorant
i
was
then
but
i
never
lost
sight
of
the
goal
i
meant
to
win
to
win
by
knowing
how
to
fill
the
position
desired
i
had
vast
dreams
even
in
those
early
days
i
was
fortunate
to
obtain
the
situation
of
lady
garribardine
secretary
and
on
leaving
the
house
after
being
engaged
i
met
lord
algy
by
chance
in
the
park
he
was
very
much
upset
and
unhappy
at
my
determination
never
to
see
him
again
and
he
asked
me
to
marry
him
i
refused
of
course
because
i
knew
even
then
that
he
only
attracted
one
side
of
me
and
also
i
was
not
educated
enough
at
that
time
to
have
been
able
to
carry
off
the
position
with
success
i
explained
everything
to
him
and
made
him
promise
to
try
and
be
a
fine
soldier
he
was
being
sent
to
egypt
for
his
extravagance
and
so
we
parted
and
i
have
never
spoken
to
him
since
my
goal
now
was
definitely
fixed
i
meant
to
educate
myself
to
be
able
to
take
the
highest
position
to
be
obtained
in
england
some
day
i
used
to
long
for
algy
sometimes
but
only
every
now
and
then
when
some
scent
or
sound
brought
him
back
to
me
that
is
why
i
said
such
love
is
unbalanced
and
animal
the
memory
of
it
is
always
aroused
by
something
of
the
senses
then
after
i
went
to
lady
garribardine
strobridge
came
upon
the
scene
and
his
great
cultivation
inspired
me
and
presently
we
became
friends
i
deliberately
encouraged
his
friendship
so
as
to
polish
my
own
brain
i
knew
he
was
in
love
with
me
so
this
may
have
been
wrong
but
since
he
was
weak
enough
to
allow
himself
to
feel
in
that
way
for
me
knowing
he
was
married
he
must
pay
the
price
in
pain
not
i
he
has
always
been
a
loyal
friend
after
the
beginning
when
he
lost
his
head
one
night
and
made
a
great
scene
my
determination
never
wavered
it
was
in
every
way
to
improve
myself
always
to
be
perfectly
true
and
finally
to
obtain
the
height
of
my
ambition
things
went
on
in
this
way
for
a
year
and
a
half
lady
garribardine
always
helping
me
and
encouraging
my
education
until
we
became
deep
and
intimate
friends
but
the
goal
never
seemed
to
come
in
view
until
i
went
to
the
house
of
lords
that
day
and
saw
you
and
heard
you
speak
in
a
lightning
flash
the
object
of
all
my
striving
seemed
revealed
to
me
and
i
began
to
lay
my
plans
but
with
some
unusual
excitement
because
something
in
you
had
aroused
an
emotion
in
my
heart
the
meaning
of
which
i
could
not
then
determine
that
night
i
went
to
the
theatre
with
my
sister
and
there
saw
in
the
stalls
lord
algy
returned
from
egypt
i
suppose
on
leave
the
sight
of
him
moved
me
i
felt
cold
and
sick
but
i
realised
once
for
all
that
my
feeling
for
him
had
been
only
physical
and
was
passing
away
i
had
arranged
with
strobridge
to
have
the
dinner
and
to
let
me
meet
you
not
as
the
secretary
because
i
knew
that
your
unconscious
prejudice
would
be
insurmountable
then
and
i
thought
that
if
you
liked
me
that
night
afterwards
the
prejudice
might
not
be
so
deep
when
you
did
know
my
real
you
will
remember
what
followed
but
the
second
part
of
the
story
begins
with
the
afternoon
you
came
into
the
schoolroom
until
then
i
had
never
had
a
backward
thought
or
regret
or
worry
about
lord
algy
i
was
only
glad
to
have
had
the
experience
that
was
all
but
after
i
had
told
you
of
my
life
and
parentage
you
bent
down
and
kissed
my
hand
and
from
that
moment
doubts
began
to
trouble
me
you
had
started
the
awakening
of
my
soul
and
as
love
grew
and
grew
so
the
blackness
of
the
shadow
increased
i
knew
that
if
i
deceived
you
i
should
only
draw
unhappiness
and
never
respect
myself
where
love
is
there
can
be
no
deceit
and
so
at
last
even
before
i
went
to
valfreyne
i
put
all
thoughts
of
you
from
me
although
each
day
you
seemed
to
grow
more
dear
until
i
knew
that
you
meant
everything
to
me
and
were
my
wild
and
passionate
desire
i
saw
that
my
position
in
life
held
you
back
and
i
was
almost
glad
that
it
should
be
so
because
i
knew
that
if
you
should
really
love
me
and
conquer
your
prejudice
against
my
class
it
would
come
to
this
that
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
and
that
it
would
part
us
forever
and
i
have
tried
to
prevent
you
from
telling
me
of
your
love
i
have
tried
to
restrain
my
own
for
you
but
now
i
am
left
defenceless
i
love
you
but
i
realise
that
what
i
did
in
the
past
the
world
could
never
forgive
and
so
i
must
pay
the
price
of
my
own
action
and
say
an
eternal
farewell
her
voice
died
away
in
a
sob
and
she
did
not
then
look
at
the
face
his
hand
had
grown
nerveless
in
its
clasp
and
she
drew
hers
away
from
him
and
rose
slowly
to
her
feet
the
awful
moment
was
over
the
story
was
done
she
had
been
true
to
herself
and
had
lost
her
love
and
now
she
must
have
courage
to
behave
with
dignity
and
go
back
to
the
house
but
she
must
just
look
at
him
once
more
her
dearly
loved
one
he
sat
there
in
an
attitude
of
utter
dejection
his
face
buried
in
his
for
long
aching
moments
katherine
watched
him
but
she
did
not
speak
and
life
and
hope
and
purpose
died
out
of
her
drowned
in
overwhelming
grief
then
after
this
horrible
silence
the
blood
seemed
to
creep
back
to
the
duke
heart
and
reaction
set
in
he
began
gradually
to
think
his
level
judgment
his
faculty
for
analyzing
things
reasserted
themselves
and
enabled
him
to
view
the
whole
subject
in
right
perspective
and
a
to
happiness
slowly
filled
him
he
looked
up
to
katherine
at
last
as
she
stood
there
leaning
against
a
pillar
of
the
balustrade
and
he
read
no
humiliation
or
shame
or
contrition
in
her
great
eyes
but
only
a
deep
sorrow
and
tenderness
and
love
and
suddenly
he
realised
the
splendour
of
her
courage
the
glorious
force
of
character
which
had
enabled
her
to
jeopardize
nay
indeed
relinquish
love
and
high
estate
and
ambition
rather
than
be
false
to
herself
she
need
not
have
told
him
anything
of
her
that
fact
was
the
great
proof
of
her
truth
he
had
asked
no
questions
about
her
past
she
had
made
no
dramatic
virtue
of
necessity
she
had
done
this
thing
that
she
might
not
soil
her
own
soul
with
deceit
of
what
matter
was
a
paltry
venial
sin
if
sin
it
were
the
shame
of
which
lay
wholly
in
a
too
rigid
convention
of
what
matter
to
him
were
three
days
in
the
past
long
before
they
had
met
that
she
was
altogether
his
now
in
body
and
soul
he
had
no
faintest
doubt
was
there
any
man
living
such
a
fool
or
puritan
that
he
would
renounce
life
joy
for
such
a
foolish
thing
the
very
qualities
of
courage
and
justice
which
her
action
in
telling
him
had
shown
would
wipe
out
any
sin
and
give
him
ample
guaranties
for
future
security
and
peace
such
a
woman
was
worth
all
the
world
and
ridiculous
puny
conventions
were
of
no
account
did
he
dream
of
looking
upon
seraphim
as
degraded
because
she
had
been
his
love
long
ago
and
not
his
wife
of
course
not
then
why
should
he
feel
scorn
for
katherine
who
had
not
even
betrayed
a
husband
but
had
been
free
scorn
was
for
such
women
as
julia
scarrisbrooke
creatures
who
simulated
passion
for
one
man
after
another
merely
as
a
game
people
who
held
love
cheaply
and
who
knew
not
even
the
glimmerings
of
obligation
to
their
own
souls
away
with
all
shams
of
the
world
none
of
them
should
influence
him
he
had
found
a
spirit
strong
and
free
and
honest
reality
had
won
forever
and
appearance
had
vanished
away
so
he
rose
and
came
to
her
again
and
once
more
took
her
into
his
arms
and
bending
kissed
her
white
forehead
as
if
in
blessing
oh
my
beloved
and
you
deemed
that
this
would
part
us
this
ugly
thing
foolish
one
you
do
not
know
how
much
i
love
you
far
beyond
any
of
the
earthly
things
darling
i
honour
your
brave
courage
i
worship
your
truth
you
shall
come
to
me
and
be
my
adored
wife
and
the
mistress
of
my
home
katherine
heart
of
me
whisper
that
all
sorrows
are
over
and
let
us
enter
heaven
together
and
forget
all
else
but
katherine
overwrought
with
emotion
lay
there
against
his
breast
limp
and
white
she
was
beyond
speech
only
her
spirit
cried
out
in
thankfulness
to
god
for
having
given
her
the
strength
to
tell
the
truth
joys
kills
not
and
soon
under
her
lover
fond
caresses
warm
life
rushed
back
to
her
and
thus
in
the
evening
glory
of
sunset
they
found
content
for
the
one
sublime
thing
in
this
sad
mad
world
is
love
chapter
xxxiii
it
was
more
than
a
month
since
in
the
late
july
of
the
joy
bells
had
rung
out
on
all
the
duke
estates
for
the
birth
of
the
heir
the
infant
marquis
of
valfreyne
and
it
was
just
a
year
since
katherine
had
become
his
duchess
and
what
a
year
in
a
woman
life
days
and
weeks
and
months
of
happiness
of
understanding
and
companionship
with
one
whose
every
action
and
thought
inspired
respect
and
love
the
bond
between
the
two
had
grown
always
more
deep
more
sacred
as
the
days
went
on
and
as
katherine
said
one
morning
fondly
mordryn
we
are
just
like
and
not
modern
people
because
we
never
want
to
be
away
from
one
another
for
a
minute
only
thank
god
you
are
not
blind
theirs
was
a
real
marriage
and
lady
garribardine
was
fully
content
she
took
personal
pride
in
the
manner
in
which
her
prot√©g√©
fulfilled
the
r√¥le
of
duchess
and
she
rejoiced
to
see
her
old
love
in
the
midst
of
such
bliss
for
their
union
was
divine
and
complete
and
the
coming
of
the
baby
valfreyne
had
been
the
crowning
joy
it
was
a
continual
source
of
delight
to
the
duke
to
watch
katherine
and
to
know
how
absolutely
his
belief
in
her
had
been
justified
to
watch
and
to
note
with
what
supreme
dignity
she
carried
out
the
duties
of
his
great
state
and
as
each
occasion
came
when
some
special
effort
was
required
after
it
was
over
she
would
rush
into
his
arms
and
caress
him
and
ask
to
be
petted
and
told
that
he
was
satisfied
and
that
his
beggar
duchess
had
pleased
him
and
done
all
that
he
would
wish
the
year
of
perfect
happiness
and
gratified
ambition
had
moulded
katherine
into
a
new
and
noble
being
in
whom
graciousness
and
sweetness
and
gentleness
enhanced
all
her
old
charms
she
continued
to
make
lady
garribardine
her
model
for
everything
the
world
had
experienced
a
nine
days
wonder
when
the
engagement
was
announced
but
as
her
ladyship
said
there
was
no
use
in
having
kept
her
iron
heel
upon
the
neck
of
society
for
all
these
years
if
she
could
not
now
impose
upon
it
unquestioned
what
she
wished
so
katherine
had
had
a
triumphant
entry
and
very
little
antagonism
to
surmount
she
paid
visits
to
all
the
duke
relatives
under
lady
garribardine
wing
and
her
own
tact
and
serene
dignity
had
conquered
them
all
and
turned
them
into
friends
she
is
of
no
particular
birth
her
ladyship
was
wont
to
say
but
who
she
is
so
you
need
none
of
you
trouble
yourselves
about
it
i
will
be
answerable
for
her
fitness
for
the
post
thus
the
most
romantic
and
fantastic
rumours
got
about
and
lady
garribardine
wrote
amusedly
to
gerard
in
russia
after
the
wedding
in
september
giving
a
description
of
events
i
issued
stern
commands
to
bronson
that
there
should
be
no
talk
below
stairs
no
gratifying
of
anybody
curiosity
and
i
think
i
can
count
upon
their
devotion
to
me
and
their
great
liking
for
the
girl
herself
to
feel
that
they
will
co√∂perate
her
family
were
the
entertaining
thing
the
sisters
from
america
wrote
sensible
letters
realising
that
the
great
divide
had
come
and
fortunately
the
bindon
green
remainder
had
themselves
cut
her
off
from
their
intimacy
because
she
was
what
they
called
a
paid
servant
living
in
apparently
a
degraded
status
in
that
incredible
class
mordryn
received
a
letter
from
her
a
few
days
after
the
news
was
in
the
papers
a
most
remarkable
bit
of
feminine
spite
which
caused
us
all
glee
informing
him
that
as
he
had
no
doubt
been
sadly
deceived
by
katherine
bush
she
felt
it
her
duty
to
enlighten
him
as
to
who
she
really
was
great
stress
was
laid
upon
the
butcher
grandfather
and
regrets
that
she
herself
had
contracted
an
alliance
so
far
beneath
her
station
but
having
experienced
the
unpleasantness
of
it
she
felt
it
was
only
right
to
warn
the
duke
i
myself
wrote
the
reply
as
though
i
had
been
his
secretary
announcing
that
his
grace
was
in
possession
of
all
these
facts
and
more
from
miss
bush
herself
and
with
due
appreciation
for
the
motive
which
had
caused
the
letter
to
be
written
the
duke
thanked
her
for
it
and
would
not
require
to
hear
from
her
again
so
all
that
part
is
disposed
of
fortunately
and
katherine
can
go
ahead
mordryn
is
frantically
in
love
and
so
is
she
mordryn
is
like
a
boy
and
looks
ten
years
younger
he
showers
gifts
upon
her
and
on
the
day
of
the
wedding
when
he
walked
down
the
aisle
with
his
beautiful
new
duchess
on
his
arm
i
never
have
seen
a
man
so
proud
and
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
he
has
every
right
to
be
for
i
must
say
the
creature
carries
out
the
whole
thing
with
a
perfection
which
justifies
my
greatest
expectations
of
her
and
i
think
they
stand
a
very
fair
chance
of
happiness
because
the
girl
has
a
logical
brain
she
is
not
one
of
those
fools
who
only
like
the
excitement
of
a
thing
being
out
of
reach
she
has
the
supreme
wisdom
of
a
sense
of
intrinsic
values
she
realises
that
she
has
secured
a
great
position
which
will
give
ample
scope
for
her
vastest
schemes
all
high
and
fine
ones
we
shall
hear
of
her
in
the
future
boy
not
only
as
a
beautiful
duchess
but
as
a
great
englishwoman
and
when
one
reflects
that
she
has
accomplished
all
this
won
her
game
so
to
speak
through
sheer
force
of
character
sheer
knowledge
of
cause
and
effect
sheer
calculation
of
action
and
no
low
scheming
one
can
not
but
deeply
respect
her
force
will
always
win
but
it
will
bring
its
own
retribution
if
it
has
been
used
katherine
has
had
the
great
cleverness
to
use
it
always
well
weak
virtue
may
draw
some
kind
of
heavenly
halo
but
perfect
honesty
and
strong
common
sense
secure
power
and
a
substantial
reward
on
earth
it
will
be
very
interesting
to
watch
her
career
as
it
goes
on
she
is
grateful
for
her
happiness
and
knows
that
it
is
only
weaklings
who
once
having
secured
this
joy
then
let
it
be
taken
from
them
by
their
own
foolishness
and
discontent
her
whole
mind
is
disciplined
and
ruled
by
an
astonishingly
sound
judgment
impulse
is
her
servant
not
her
master
every
view
is
broad
she
sees
all
things
as
they
really
are
without
the
illusion
which
nearly
every
woman
invests
them
with
and
above
all
she
understands
mordryn
and
with
all
her
balance
and
she
is
as
passionate
and
vital
and
living
as
a
woman
can
be
and
that
is
the
one
kind
of
being
who
keeps
a
man
with
his
temperament
forever
content
after
his
life
of
restraint
and
abstinence
and
solitary
grief
to
have
such
a
creature
for
a
companion
must
be
no
mean
delight
so
altogether
my
dear
boy
i
am
satisfied
as
for
his
age
he
does
not
look
a
day
more
than
forty
they
probably
will
have
a
glorious
fifteen
years
and
you
can
not
have
everything
in
life
he
suits
her
far
better
than
some
younger
man
they
are
made
for
one
another
mordryn
has
perfect
health
and
strength
and
no
human
being
could
be
more
attractive
you
have
not
a
notion
of
his
ways
as
a
lover
he
would
be
a
lesson
to
any
of
these
uncouth
drinking
modern
young
men
our
duchess
is
a
fortunate
creature
i
assure
you
in
more
ways
than
one
so
we
need
not
trouble
about
that
or
make
unto
ourselves
a
picture
of
a
young
woman
and
an
elderly
man
they
are
like
a
pair
of
love
birds
and
they
will
probably
have
that
sturdy
heir
at
once
that
i
have
always
longed
for
and
then
i
can
rest
in
peace
and
when
gerard
read
this
at
moscow
where
he
happened
to
be
he
was
glad
and
yet
sad
the
wedded
lovers
wandered
for
several
months
in
france
and
italy
returning
to
england
only
in
the
new
year
and
all
this
interesting
foreign
travel
expanded
still
further
katherine
mental
gifts
then
after
some
triumphant
weeks
in
london
there
were
long
months
of
joy
at
valfreyne
awaiting
the
coming
of
the
son
and
heir
and
now
in
the
early
days
of
september
they
were
all
again
assembled
there
with
lady
garribardine
for
the
christening
a
great
and
important
event
but
war
and
strain
and
sorrow
lay
with
that
black
shadow
over
england
fallen
with
a
suddenness
which
no
one
could
realise
as
yet
rumours
of
reverses
had
come
miscalculation
of
somebody
plans
and
anxiety
was
tense
katherine
was
resting
on
the
sofa
in
her
boudoir
which
looked
out
south
over
the
exquisite
gardens
in
the
state
suite
at
valfreyne
the
suite
of
her
who
should
be
reigning
duchess
in
which
she
had
wandered
with
the
duke
on
that
monday
in
whitsuntide
when
they
had
said
their
futile
farewell
and
now
it
was
her
own
and
in
an
hour
they
would
go
into
the
chapel
and
the
splendid
chubby
baby
heir
would
receive
his
many
names
katherine
felt
very
well
and
in
herself
supremely
happy
in
spite
of
the
clouds
over
england
how
good
providence
had
been
to
her
how
grateful
her
spirit
felt
she
lay
there
in
a
peaceful
dream
her
half
closed
eyes
taking
in
the
wonderful
beauty
of
the
room
with
its
late
seventeenth
century
magnificence
and
yet
subtle
touches
of
home
then
the
door
opened
and
the
duke
came
in
with
letters
for
her
from
the
second
post
and
the
opened
he
had
been
reading
in
his
hand
he
put
them
down
upon
a
table
near
and
took
a
low
chair
close
to
his
lady
side
and
she
moved
a
little
from
the
sofa
so
that
she
lay
half
in
his
arms
my
worshipped
one
he
murmured
fondly
kissing
her
hair
and
smoothing
it
with
infinite
tenderness
oh
mordryn
i
am
so
happy
are
not
you
what
a
sublime
day
for
us
dear
love
just
to
think
that
we
have
that
darling
little
son
the
very
essence
of
us
both
tell
me
that
he
and
i
mean
everything
to
you
tell
me
that
i
have
given
you
all
you
want
he
reassured
her
with
passionate
insistence
as
though
he
could
not
say
enough
and
then
he
asked
her
again
and
again
if
she
loved
him
it
was
as
if
he
must
have
confirmation
of
her
passion
for
him
and
her
consent
and
katherine
played
with
him
fondly
as
was
her
wont
being
altogether
fascinating
and
full
of
foolish
tender
love
tricks
which
never
failed
to
intoxicate
his
senses
but
soon
he
held
her
closely
to
him
some
shadow
in
his
eyes
and
with
his
free
arm
he
reached
over
to
the
table
and
picked
up
the
then
he
spoke
and
his
wonderful
voice
sounded
a
little
strained
my
darling
there
is
some
news
in
the
paper
this
morning
which
may
cause
you
some
concern
so
i
have
brought
it
to
you
here
while
we
are
alone
it
is
about
the
retreat
from
mons
katherine
raised
herself
and
looked
at
him
enquiringly
and
he
found
the
column
and
began
to
read
the
glorious
story
and
of
one
supremely
splendid
stand
made
by
a
certain
guards
regiment
which
is
now
then
he
paused
and
hesitated
for
a
moment
for
the
name
of
the
bravest
who
would
gain
the
was
lord
algernon
who
had
performed
an
act
of
daring
courage
resourcefulness
and
which
had
saved
his
men
but
who
had
paid
with
his
life
for
his
last
supreme
effort
being
shot
through
the
heart
as
he
had
returned
to
a
wounded
comrade
lieutenant
jack
kilcourcy
to
bring
him
in
to
safety
from
that
bloody
wood
what
is
it
mordryn
please
go
on
so
the
duke
read
to
the
end
and
then
put
the
paper
down
and
suddenly
katherine
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
and
a
mist
darkened
the
room
and
when
it
lifted
she
saw
only
the
young
d√©bonnaire
face
of
her
once
dear
lover
gazing
at
her
again
her
gay
blue
eyes
alight
with
laughter
and
love
and
with
a
stifled
cry
she
buried
her
head
on
the
duke
shoulder
and
burst
into
tears
thus
algy
had
fulfilled
her
hopes
for
him
and
become
a
fine
soldier
and
had
died
gallantly
to
save
a
comrade
a
hero
