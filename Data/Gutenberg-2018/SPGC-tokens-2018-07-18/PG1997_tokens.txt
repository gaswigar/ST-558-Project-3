who
moves
everything
penetrates
through
the
universe
and
shines
in
one
part
more
and
in
another
less
in
the
heaven
that
receives
most
of
its
light
i
have
been
and
have
seen
things
which
he
who
descends
from
thereabove
neither
knows
how
nor
is
able
to
recount
because
drawing
near
to
its
own
desire
our
understanding
enters
so
deep
that
the
memory
can
not
follow
truly
whatever
of
the
holy
realm
i
could
treasure
up
in
my
mind
shall
now
be
the
theme
of
my
song
the
innate
desire
of
the
soul
is
to
attain
the
vision
of
god
o
good
apollo
for
this
last
labor
make
me
such
a
vessel
of
thy
power
as
thou
demandest
for
the
gift
of
the
loved
laurel
thus
far
one
summit
of
parnassus
has
been
enough
for
me
but
now
with
both
i
need
to
enter
the
remaining
arena
enter
into
my
breast
and
breathe
thou
in
such
wise
as
when
thou
drewest
marsyas
from
out
the
sheath
of
his
limbs
o
divine
power
if
thou
lend
thyself
to
me
so
that
i
may
make
manifest
the
image
of
the
blessed
realm
imprinted
within
my
head
thou
shalt
see
me
come
to
thy
chosen
tree
and
crown
myself
then
with
those
leaves
of
which
the
theme
and
thou
will
make
me
worthy
so
rarely
father
are
they
gathered
for
triumph
or
of
caesar
or
of
poet
fault
and
shame
of
the
human
wills
that
the
peneian
leaf
should
bring
forth
joy
unto
the
joyous
delphic
deity
whenever
it
makes
any
one
to
long
for
it
great
flame
follows
a
little
spark
perhaps
after
me
prayer
shall
be
made
with
better
voices
whereto
cyrrha
may
respond
so
inspire
me
in
this
labor
that
i
may
deserve
the
gift
of
the
laurel
the
muses
were
fabled
to
dwell
on
one
peak
of
parnassus
apollo
on
the
other
at
the
opening
of
the
preceding
parts
of
his
poem
dante
has
invoked
the
muses
only
daphne
who
was
changed
to
the
laurel
was
the
daughter
of
peneus
cyrrha
a
city
sacred
to
apollo
not
far
from
the
foot
of
parnassus
and
here
used
for
the
name
of
the
god
himself
the
lamp
of
the
world
rises
to
mortals
through
different
passages
but
from
that
which
joins
four
circles
with
three
crosses
it
issues
with
better
course
and
conjoined
with
a
better
star
and
it
tempers
and
seals
the
mundane
wax
more
after
its
own
fashion
almost
such
a
passage
had
made
morning
there
and
evening
here
and
there
all
that
hemisphere
was
white
and
the
other
part
black
when
i
saw
beatrice
turned
upon
the
left
side
and
looking
into
the
sun
never
did
eagle
so
fix
himself
upon
it
and
even
as
a
second
ray
is
wont
to
issue
from
the
first
and
mount
upward
again
like
a
pilgrim
who
wishes
to
return
thus
of
her
action
infused
through
the
eyes
into
my
imagination
mine
was
made
and
i
fixed
my
eyes
upon
the
sun
beyond
our
use
much
is
allowed
there
which
here
is
not
allowed
to
our
faculties
thanks
to
the
place
made
for
the
human
race
as
its
proper
abode
not
long
did
i
endure
it
nor
so
little
that
i
did
not
see
it
sparkling
round
about
like
iron
that
issues
boiling
from
the
fire
and
on
a
sudden
day
seemed
to
be
added
to
day
as
if
he
who
is
able
had
adorned
the
heaven
with
another
sun
in
the
spring
the
sun
rises
from
a
point
on
the
horizon
where
the
four
great
circles
namely
the
horizon
the
zodiac
theequator
and
the
equinoctial
colure
meet
and
cutting
each
other
form
three
crosses
the
sun
is
in
the
sign
of
aries
a
better
star
because
the
influence
of
this
constellation
was
supposed
to
be
benignant
and
under
it
the
earth
reclothes
itself
it
was
the
season
assigned
to
the
creation
and
to
the
annunciation
there
in
the
earthly
paradise
here
on
earth
it
is
the
morning
of
thursday
april
the
hours
from
the
preceding
to
this
dawn
are
undescribed
the
earthly
paradise
made
for
man
in
his
original
excellence
so
rapid
was
his
ascent
to
the
sphere
of
fire
drawn
upward
by
the
eyes
of
beatrice
beatrice
was
standing
with
her
eyes
wholly
fixed
on
the
eternal
wheels
and
on
her
i
fixed
my
eyes
from
thereabove
removed
looking
at
her
i
inwardly
became
such
as
glaucus
became
on
tasting
of
the
herb
which
made
him
consort
in
the
sea
of
the
other
gods
transhumanizing
can
not
be
signified
in
words
therefore
let
the
example
suffice
for
him
to
whom
grace
reserves
experience
if
i
was
only
what
of
me
thou
didst
the
last
create
o
love
that
governest
the
heavens
thou
knowest
who
with
thy
light
didst
lift
me
when
the
revolution
which
thou
being
desired
makest
eternal
made
me
attent
unto
itself
with
the
harmony
which
thou
attunest
and
modulatest
so
much
of
the
heaven
then
seemed
to
me
enkindled
by
the
flame
of
the
sun
that
rain
or
river
never
made
so
broad
a
lake
a
fisherman
changed
to
a
the
story
is
in
ovid
metamorphoses
just
cited
of
glauens
in
the
canto
of
purgatory
dante
has
said
that
when
the
articulation
of
the
brain
is
perfect
god
breathes
into
it
a
new
spirit
the
living
soul
and
he
means
here
that
like
paul
caught
up
into
paradise
he
can
not
tell
whether
in
the
body
or
out
of
the
body
corinthians
xii
the
desire
to
be
united
with
god
is
the
source
of
the
eternal
revolution
of
the
heavens
the
empyrean
is
the
cause
of
the
most
swift
motion
of
the
primum
mobile
because
of
the
most
ardent
desire
of
every
part
of
the
latter
to
be
conjoined
with
every
part
of
that
most
divine
quiet
heaven
convito
the
novelty
of
the
sound
and
the
great
light
kindled
in
me
a
desire
concerning
their
cause
never
before
felt
with
such
acuteness
whereupon
she
who
saw
me
as
i
see
myself
to
quiet
my
perturbed
mind
opened
her
mouth
ere
i
mine
to
ask
and
began
thou
thyself
makest
thyself
dull
with
false
imagining
so
that
thou
seest
not
what
thou
wouldst
see
if
thou
hadst
shaken
it
off
thou
art
not
on
earth
as
thou
believest
but
lightning
flying
from
its
proper
site
never
ran
as
thou
who
thereunto
returnest
to
thine
own
proper
site
heaven
the
true
home
of
the
soul
if
i
was
divested
of
my
first
doubt
by
these
brief
little
out
words
within
a
new
one
was
i
the
more
enmeshed
and
i
said
already
i
rested
content
concerning
a
great
wonder
but
now
i
wonder
how
i
can
transcend
these
light
bodies
whereupon
she
after
a
pitying
sigh
directed
her
eyes
toward
me
with
that
look
which
a
mother
turns
on
her
delirious
son
and
she
began
all
things
whatsoever
have
order
among
themselves
and
this
is
the
form
which
makes
the
universe
like
to
god
here
the
high
creatures
see
the
imprint
of
the
eternal
goodness
which
is
the
end
for
which
the
aforesaid
rule
is
made
in
the
order
of
which
i
speak
all
natures
are
arranged
by
diverse
lots
more
or
less
near
to
their
source
wherefore
they
are
moved
to
diverse
ports
through
the
great
sea
of
being
and
each
one
with
an
instinct
given
to
it
which
may
bear
it
on
this
bears
the
fire
upward
toward
the
moon
this
is
the
motive
force
in
mortal
hearts
this
binds
together
and
unites
the
earth
nor
does
this
bow
shoot
forth
only
the
created
things
which
are
outside
intelligence
but
also
those
which
have
understanding
and
love
the
providence
that
adjusts
all
this
with
its
own
light
makes
forever
quiet
the
heaven
within
which
that
revolves
which
hath
the
greatest
speed
and
thither
now
as
to
a
site
decreed
the
virtue
of
that
cord
bears
us
on
which
directs
to
a
joyful
mark
whatever
it
shoots
true
is
it
that
as
the
form
often
accords
not
to
the
intention
of
the
art
because
the
material
is
deaf
to
respond
so
the
creature
sometimes
deviates
from
this
course
for
it
has
power
though
thus
impelled
to
incline
in
another
direction
even
as
the
fire
of
a
cloud
may
be
seen
to
fall
if
the
first
impetus
bent
aside
by
false
pleasure
turn
it
earthwards
thou
shouldst
not
if
i
deem
aright
wonder
more
at
thy
ascent
than
at
a
stream
if
from
a
high
mountain
it
descends
to
the
base
a
marvel
it
would
be
in
thee
if
deprived
of
hindrance
thou
hadst
sat
below
even
as
quiet
in
living
fire
on
earth
would
be
in
this
order
of
the
universe
the
created
beings
endowed
with
souls
angels
and
men
the
source
of
their
being
god
this
instinct
directs
to
their
proper
end
animate
as
well
as
inanimate
things
as
the
bow
shoots
the
arrow
to
its
mark
the
empyrean
within
which
the
primum
mobile
the
first
moving
heaven
revolves
contrary
to
its
true
nature
thereon
she
turned
again

they
saw
jason
become
a
ploughman
the
concreate
and
perpetual
thirst
for
the
deiform
realm
was
bearing
us
on
swift
almost
as
ye
see
the
heavens
beatrice
was
looking
upward
and
i
upon
her
and
perhaps
in
such
time
as
a
quarrel
rests
and
flies
and
from
the
notch
is
unlocked
i
saw
myself
arrived
where
a
wonderful
thing
drew
my
sight
to
itself
and
therefore
she
from
whom
the
working
of
my
mind
could
not
be

turned

as

conjoined

the
inverse
order

the
instantaneousness
of
the
act

moon
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
cloud
had
covered
us
lucid
dense
solid
and
polished
like
a
diamond
which
the
sun
had
struck
within
itself
the
eternal
pearl
had
received
us
even
as
water
receives
a
ray
of
light
remaining
unbroken
if

and
here
it
is
not
conceivable
how
one
dimension
brooked

must
be

desire
ought
the
more
to
kindle
us
to
see
that
essence
in
which
is
seen
how
our
nature
and
god
were
united
there
will
be
seen
that
which
we
hold
by
faith
not
demonstrated
but
it
will
be
known
of
itself
like
the
first
truth
which
man
believes
on
earth
by
mortal
faculties
not
demonstrated
by
argument
but

by
direct
cognition

i
can
do
i
thank
him
who
from
the
mortal
world
has
removed
me
but
tell
me
what
are
the
dusky
marks
of
this
body
which
there
below
on
earth
make
people
fable
about
cain
fancying
the
dark
spaces
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
to
represent
cain
carrying
a
for
the
fire
of
his
sacrifice
she
smiled
somewhat
and
then
she
said
if
the
opinion
of
mortals
errs
where
the
key
of
sense
unlocks
not
surely
the
shafts
of
wonder
ought
not
now
to
pierce
thee
since
thou
seest
that
the
reason
following
the
senses
has
short
wings
but
tell
me
what
thou
thyself
thinkest
of
it
and
i
that
which
here
above
appears
to
us
diverse
i
believe
is
caused
by
rare
and
dense
bodies
and
she
surely
enough
thou
shalt
see
that
thy
belief
is
submerged
in
error
if
then
listenest
well
to
the
argument
that
i
shall
make
against
it
the
eighth
sphere
displays
to
you
many
lights
which
may
be
noted
of
different
aspects
in
quality
and
quantity
if
rare
and
dense
effected
all
this
one
single
virtue
more
or
less
or
equally
distributed
would
be
in
all
different
virtues
must
needs
be
fruits
of
formal
principles
and
by
thy
reckoning
these
all
but
one
would
be
destroyed
further
if
rarity
were
the
cause
of
that
darkness
of
which
you
ask
either
this
planet
would
be
thus
deficient
of
its
matter
through
and
through
or
else
as
a
body
distributes
the
fat
and
the
loan
so
this
would
interchange
the
leaves
in
its
volume
if
the
first
were
the
case
it
would
be
manifest
in
the
eclipses
of
the
sun
by
the
shining
through
of
the
light
as
when
it
is
poured
out
upon
any
other
rare
body
this
is
not
so
therefore
we
must
look
at
the
other
and
if
it
happen
that
i
quash
this
other
thy
opinion
will
be
falsified
if
it
be
that
this
rare
passes
not
through
there
needs
must
be
a
limit
beyond
which
its
contrary
allows
it
not
to
pass
further
and
thence
the
ray
from
another
body
is
poured
back
just
as
color
returns
through
a
glass
which
hides
lead
behind
itself
now
thou
wilt
say
that
the
ray
shows
itself
dimmer
there
than
in
the
other
parts
by
being
there
reflected
from
further
back
from
this
objection
experiment
which
is
wont
to
be
the
fountain
to
the
streams
of
your
arts
may
deliver
thee
if
ever
thou
try
it
thou
shalt
take
three
mirrors
and
set
two
of
them
at
an
equal
distance
from
thee
and
let
the
other
further
removed
meet
thine
eyes
between
the
first
two
turning
toward
them
cause
a
light
to
be
placed
behind
thy
back
which
may
illumine
the
three
mirrors
and
return
to
thee
thrown
back
front
all
although
the
more
distant
image
reach
thee
not
so
great
in
quantity
thou
wilt
then
see
how
it
can
not
but
be
of
equal
brightness
the
heaven
of
the
fixed
stars
if
all
this
difference
were
caused
merely
by
difference
in
rarity
and
density
the
stars
exert
various
influences
hence
their
differences
from
which
the
variety
of
their
influence
proceeds
must
be
caused
by
different
formal
principles
or
intrinsic
causes
extends
not
through
the
whole
substance
of
the
moon
now
as
beneath
the
blows
of
the
warm
rays
that
which
lies
under
the
snow
remains
bare
both
of
the
former
color
and
the
cold
thee
thus
remaining
in
thy
intellect
will
i
inform
with
light
so
living
that
it
shall
tremble
in
its
aspect
to
thee
the
color
of
the
snow
my
argument
has
removed
the
error
which
covered
thy
mind
and
nov
i
will
tell
thee
the
true
cause
of
the
variety
in
the
surface
of
the
moon
within
the
heaven
of
the
divine
peace
revolves
a
body
in
whose
virtue
lies
the
being
of
all
that
it
contains
the
following
heaven
which
has
so
many
sights
distributes
that
being
through
divers
essences
from
it
distinct
and
by
it
contained
the
other
spheres
by
various
differences
dispose
the
distinctions
which
they
have
within
themselves
unto
their
ends
and
their
seeds

organs

thus
proceed
as
thou
now
seest
from
grade
to

they
receivefrom
above
and
operate
below
observe
me
well
how
i
advance
through
this
place
to
the
truth
which
thou
desirest
so
that
hereafter
thou
mayest
know
to
keep
the
ford
alone
the
motion
and
the
virtue
of
the
holy
spheres
must
needs
be
inspired
by
blessed
motors
as
the
work
of
the
hammer
by
the
smith
and
the
heaven
which
so
many
lights
make
beautiful
takes
its
image
from
the
deep
mind
which
revolves
it
and
makes
thereof
a
seal
and
as
the
soul
within
your
dust
is
diffused
through
different
members
and
conformed
to
divers
potencies
so
the
intelligence
displays
its
own
goodness
multiplied
through
the
stars
itself
circling
upon
its
own
unity
divers
virtue
makes
divers
alloy
with
the
precious
body
that
it
quickens
in
which
even
as
life
in
you
it
is
bound
because
of
the
glad
nature
whence
it
flows
the
virtue
mingled
through
the
body
shines
as
gladness
through
the
living
pupil
from
this

whatso
seems
different
between

their

first
had
heated
my
breast
with
love
proving

refuting
had
uncovered
to
me
the
sweet
aspect
of
fair
truth
and
i
in
order
to
confess
myself
corrected
and
assured
so
far
as
was
needful
raised
my
head
more
erect
to
speak
but
a
vision
appeared
which
held
me
to
itself
so
close
in
order
to
be
seen
that
of
my
confession
i
remembered
not
as
through
transparent
and
polished
glasses
or
through
clear
and
tranquil
waters
not
so
deep
that
their
bed
be
lost
the
lineaments
of
our
faces
return
so
feebly
that
a
pearl
on
a
white
brow
comes
not
less
readily
to
our
eyes
so
i
saw
many
faces
eager
to
speak
wherefore
i
ran
into
the
error
contrary
to
that
which
kindled
love
between
the
man
and
the
fountain
suddenly
even
as
i
became
aware
of
them
supposing
them
mirrored
semblances
i
turned
my
eyes
to
see
of
whom
they
were
and
i
saw
nothing
and
i
turned
them
forward
again
straight
into
the
light
of
the
sweet
guide
who
smiling
was
glowing
in
her
holy
eyes
wonder
not
because
i
smile
she
said
to
me
at
thy
puerile
thought
since
thy
foot
trusts
itself
not
yet
upon
the
truth
but
turns
thee
as
it
is
wont
to
emptiness
true
substances
are
these
which
thou
seest
here
relegated
through
failure
in
their
vows
therefore
speak
with
them
and
hear
and
believe
for
the
veracious
light
which
satisfies
them
allows
them
not
to
turn
their
feet
from

conceived

i
directed
me
to
the
shade
that
seemed
most
eager
to
speak
and
i
began
even
like
a
man
whom
too
strong
wish
confuses
o
spirit
who
in
the
rays
of
life
eternal
tastest
the
sweetness
which
untasted
never
is
understood
it
will
be
gracious
to
me
if
thou
contentest
me
with
thy
name
and
with
your
destiny
whereon
she
promptly
and
with
smiling
eyes
our
charity
locks
not
its
door
to
a
just
wish
more
than
that
which
wills
that
all
its
court
be
like
itself
i
was
in
the
world
a
virgin
sister
and
if
thy
mind
well
regards
my
being
more
beautiful
will
not
conceal
me
from
thee
but
thou
wilt
recognize
that
i
am
piccarda
who
placed
here
with
these
other
blessed
ones
am
blessed
in
the
slowest
sphere
our
affections
which
are
inflamed
only
in
the
pleasure
of
the
holy
spirit
rejoice
in
being
formed
according
to
his
order
and
this
allotment
which
appears
so
low
is
forsooth
given
to
us
because
our
vows
were
neglected
or
void
in
some
part
whereon
i
to
her
in
your
marvellous
aspects
there
shines
i
know
not
what
divine
which
transmutes
you
from
our
first
conceptions
therefore
i
was
not
swift
in
remembering
but
now
that
which
you
say
to
me
assists
me
so
that
refiguring
is
plainer
to
me
but
tell
me
ye
who
are
happy
here
do
ye
desire
a
highher
place
in
order
to
see
more
or
to
make
yourselves
more
friends
with
those
other
shades
she
first
smiled
a
little
then
answered
me
so
glad
that
she
seemed
to
burn
in
the
first
fire

us
not

should
we
desire
to

would
be
discordant
with
the

who
assigns
us
to
this
place
which
thou
wilt
see
is
not
possible
in
these
circles
if
to
be
in
charity
is
here
necesse
and
if
its
nature
thou
dost
well
consider
nay
it
is
essential
to
this

hold
ourselves
within

so
that
as

is
pleasing
as
to
the

it
may

clear
was
it
then
to
me
how
everywhere
in

is
paradise
although
the
grace
of
the
supreme
good
rains
not
there
in
one
measure
but
even
as
it
happen
if
one
food
sates
and
for
another
the
appetite
still
remains
that
this
is
asked
for
and
that
declined
with
thanks
so
did
i
with
gesture
and
with
speech
to
learn
from
her
what
was
the
web
whereof
she
did
not
draw
the
shuttle
to
the
head
perfect
life
and
high
merit
a
lady
higher
up
she
said
to
me
according
to
whose
rule
in
your
world
below
there
are
who
vest
and
veil
themselves
so
that
till
death
they
may
wake
and
sleep
with
that
spouse
who
accepts
every
vow
which
love
conforms
unto
his
pleasure
a
young
girl
i
fled
from
the
world
to
follow
her
and
in
her
garb
i
shut
myself
and
pledged
me
to
the
pathway
of
her
order
afterward
men
more
used
to
ill
than
good
dragged
me
forth
from
the
sweet
cloister
and
god
knows
what
then
my
life
became
and
this
other
splendor
which
shows
itself
to
thee
at
my
right
side
and
which
glows
with
all
the
light
of
our
sphere
that
which
i
say
of
me
understands
of
herself
a
sister
was
she
and
in
like
manner
from
her
head
the
shadow
of
the
sacred
veils
was
taken
but
after
she
too
was
returned
unto
the
world
against
her
liking
and
against
good
usage
from
the
veil
of
the
heart
she
was
never
unbound
this
is
the
light
of
the
great
constance
who
from
the
second
wind
of
swabia
produced
the
third
and
the
last
power
to
learn
from
her
what
was
the
vow
which
she
did
not
fulfil
according
to
the
old
commentators
her
brother
corso
forced
piccarda
by
violence
to
leave
the
convent
in
order
to
make
a
marriage
which
he
desired
for
her
her
experience
was
similar
to
that
of
piccarda
she
remained
a
nun
at
heart
constance
daughter
of
the
king
of
sicily
roger
married
in
to
the
emperor
henry
the
son
of
frederick
barbarossa
and
father
of
frederick
ii
who
died
in
the
last
emperor
of
his
line
thus
she
spoke
to
me
and
then
began
singing
ave
maria
and
singing
vanished
like
a
heavy
thing
through
deep
water
my
sight
that
followed
her
so
far
as
was
possible
after
it
lost
her
turned
to
the
mark
of
greater
desire
and
wholly
rendered
itself
to
beatrice
but
she
so
flashed
upon
my
gaze
that
at
first
the
sight
endured
it
not
and
this
made
me
more
slow
in
questioning
canto
iv
doubts
of
dante
respecting
the
justice
of
heaven
and
the
abode
of
the
blessed
solved
by
question
of
dante
as
to
the
possibility
of
reparation
for
broken
vows
between
two
viands
distant
and
attractive
in
like
measure
a
free
man
would
die
of
hunger
before
he
would
bring
one
of
them
to
his
teeth
thus
a
lamb
would
stand
between
two
ravenings
of
fierce
wolves
fearing
equally
thus
would
stand
a
dog
between
two
does
hence
if
urged
by
my
doubts
in
like
measure
i
was
silent
i
blame
not
myself
nor
since
it
was
necessary
do
i
commend
i
was
silent
but
my
desire
was
depicted
on
my
face
and
the
questioning
with
that
far
more
fervent
than
by
distinct
speech
beatrice
did
what
daniel
did
delivering
nebuchadnezzar
from
anger
which
had
made
him
unjustly
cruel
and
said
i
see
clearly
how
one
and
the
other
desire
draws
thee
so
that
thy
care
so
binds
itself
that
it
breathes
not
forth
thou
reasonest
the
good
will
endure
by
what
reckoning
doth
the
violence
of
others
lessen
for
me
the
measure
of
desert
further
it
gives
thee
occasion
for
doubt
that
the
souls
appear
to
return
to
the
stars
in
accordance
with
the
opinion
of
plato
these
are
the
questions
that
thrust
equally
upon
thy
wish
and
therefore
i
will
treat
first
of
that
which
hath
the
most
venom
plato
in
his
timaeus
says
that
the
creator
of
the
universe
assigned
each
soul
to
a
star
whence
they
were
to
be
sown
in
the
vessels
of
he
who
lived
well
during
his
appointed
time
was
to
return
to
the
star
which
was
his
habitation
and
there
he
would
have
a
blessed
and
suitable
existence
dante
doubt
has
arisen
from
the
words
of
piccarda
which
implied
that
her
station
was
in
the
sphere
of
the
moon
the
conception
that
the
souls
after
death
had
their
abode
in
the
stars
would
be
a
definite
heresy
and
hence
far
more
dangerous
than
a
question
concerning
the
justice
of
heaven
for
such
a
question
might
be
consistent
with
entire
faith
in
that
justice
of
the
seraphim
he
who
is
most
in
god
moses
samuel
and
whichever
john
thou
wilt
take
i
say
and
even
mary
have
not
their
seats
in
another
heaven
than
those
spirits
who
just
now
appeared
to
thee
nor
have
they
more
or
fewer
years
for
their
existence
but
all
make
beautiful
the
first
circle
and
have
sweet
life
in
different
measure
through
feeling
more
or
less
the
eternal
breath
they
showed
themselves
here
not
because
this
sphere
is
allotted
to
them
but
to
afford
sign
of
the
celestial
condition
which
is
least
exalted
to
speak
thus
is
befitting
to
your
mind
since
only
by
objects
of
the
sense
doth
it
apprehend
that
which
it
then
makes
worthy
of
the
understanding
for
this
reason
the
scripture
condescends
to
your
capacity
and
attributes
feet
and
hands
to
god
while
meaning
otherwise
and
holy
church
represents
to
you
with
human
aspect
gabriel
and
michael
and
the
other
who
made
tobias
whole
again
that
which
timaeus
reasons
of
the
souls
is
not
like
this
which
is
seen
here
since
it
seems
that
he
thinks
as
he
says
he
says
that
the
soul
returns
to
its
own
star
believing
it
to
have
been
severed
thence
when
nature
gave
it
as
the
form
and
perchance
his
opinion
is
of
other
guise
than
his
words
sound
and
may
be
of
a
meaning
not
to
be
derided
if
he
means
that
the
honor
of
their
influence
and
the
blame
returns
to
these
wheels
perhaps
his
bow
hits
on
some
truth
this
principle
ill
understood
formerly
turned
awry
almost
the
whole
world
so
that
it
ran
astray
in
naming
jove
mercury
and
mars
the
abode
of
all
the
blessed
is
the
empyrean
the
first
circle
counting
from
above
but
there
are
degrees
in
blessedness
each
spirit
enjoying
according
to
its
capacity
no
one
is
conscious
of
any
lack
the
archangel
raphael
the
intellectual
soul
is
united
with
the
body
as
its
substantial
form
that
by
means
of
which
anything
performs
its
functions
operatur
is
its
form
the
soul
is
that
by
which
the
body
lives
and
hence
is
its
summa
lxxvi
the
belief
in
the
influence
of
the
stars
led
men
to
assign
to
them
divine
powers
and
to
name
their
gods
after
them
the
other
dubitation
which
disturbs
thee
has
less
venom
for
its
malice
could
not
lead
thee
from
me
elsewhere
that
our
justice
seems
unjust
in
the
eyes
of
mortals
is
argument
of
faith
and
not
of
heretical
iniquity
but
in
order
that
your
perception
may
surely
penetrate
unto
this
truth
i
will
make
thee
content
as
thou
desirest
though
there
be
violence
when
he
who
suffers
nowise
consents
to
him
who
compels
these
souls
were
not
by
reason
of
that
excused
for
will
unless
it
wills
is
not
quenched
but
does
as
nature
does
in
fire
though
violence
a
thousand
times
may
wrest
it
wherefore
if
it
bend
much
or
little
it
follows
the
force
and
thus
these
did
having
power
to
return
to
the
holy
place
if
their
will
had
been
entire
such
as
held
lawrence
on
the
gridiron
and
made
mucius
severe
unto
his
hand
it
would
have
urged
them
back
so
soon
as
they
were
loosed
along
the
road
on
which
they
had
been
dragged
but
will
so
firm
is
too
rare
and
by
these
words
if
thou
hast
gathered
them
up
as
thou
shouldst
is
the
argument
quashed
that
would
have
given
thee
annoy
yet
many
times
mortals
would
not
trouble
themselves
concerning
the
justice
of
god
unless
they
had
faith
in
it
these
perplexities
are
then
arguments
or
proofs
of
faith
as
thomas
aquinas
says
the
merit
of
faith
consists
in
believing
what
one
does
not
see
but
in
this
case
as
beatrice
goes
on
to
show
mere
human
intelligence
if
sufficient
to
see
that
the
injustice
is
only
apparent
violence
has
no
power
over
the
will
the
original
will
may
however
by
act
of
will
be
changed
but
now
another
path
runs
traverse
before
thine
eyes
such
that
by
thyself
thou
wouldst
not
issue
forth
therefrom
ere
thou
wert
weary
i
have
put
it
in
thy
mind
for
certain
that
a
soul
in
bliss
can
not
lie
since
it
is
always
near
to
the
primal
truth
and
then
thou
hast
heard
from
piccarda
that
constance
retained
affection
for
the
veil
so
that
she
seems
in
this
to
contradict
me
often
ere
now
brother
has
it
happened
that
in
order
to
escape
peril
that
which
it
was
not
meet
to
do
has
been
done
against
one
liking
even
as
alcmaeon
who
thereto
entreated
by
his
father
slew
his
own
mother
not
to
lose
piety
pitiless
became
on
this
point
i
wish
thee
to
think
that
the
violence
is
mingled
with
the
will
and
they
so
act
that
the
offences
can
not
be
excused
absolute
will
consents
not
to
the
wrong
but
the
will
in
so
far
consents
thereto
as
it
fears
if
it
draw
back
to
fall
into
greater
trouble
therefore
when
piccarda
says
that
she
means
it
of
the
absolute
will
and
i
of
the
other
so
that
we
both
speak
truth
alike
such
was
the
current
of
the
holy
stream
which
issued
from
the
fount
whence
every
truth
flows
forth
and
such
it
set
at
rest
one
and
the
other
desire
o
beloved
of
the
first
lover
o
divine
one
said
i
then
whose
speech
inundates
me
and
warms
me
so
that
more
and
more
it
quickens
me
my
affection
is
not
so
profound
that
it
can
suffice
to
render
to
you
grace
for
grace
but
may
he
who
sees
and
can
respond
for
this
i
clearly
see
that
our
intellect
is
never
satisfied
unless
the
truth
illume
it
outside
of
which
no
truth
extends
in
that
it
reposes
as
a
wild
beast
in
his
lair
soon
as
it
has
reached
it
and
it
can
reach
it
otherwise
every
desire
would
be
in
vain
because
of
this
the
doubt
in
likeness
of
a
shoot
springs
up
at
the
foot
of
the
truth
and
it
is
nature
which
urges
us
to
the
summit
from
height
to
height
this
invites
me
this
gives
me
assurance
lady
with
reverence
to
ask
you
of
another
truth
which
is
obscure
to
me
i
wish
to
know
if
man
can
make
satisfaction
to
you
for
defective
vows
with
other
goods
so
that
in
your
scales
they
may
not
be
light
looked
at
we
with
such
divine
eyes
full
of
the
sparks
of
love
that
my
power
vanquished
turned
its
back
and
almost
i
lost
myself
with
eyes
cast
down
of
this
constant
desire
for
truth
this
natural
impulse
to
you
that
is
to
the
court
of
heaven
canto
the
sanctity
of
vows
and
the
seriousness
with
which
they
are
to
be
made
or
ascent
to
the
heaven
of
the
shade
of
justinian
if
i
flame
upon
thee
in
the
heat
of
love
beyond
the
fashion
that
on
earth
is
seen
go
that
i
vanquish
the
valor
of
thine
eyes
marvel
not
for
it
proceeds
from
perfect
vision
which
according
as
it
apprehends
so
moves
its
feet
to
the
apprehended
good
i
see
clearly
how
already
shines
in
thy
intellect
the
eternal
light
which
being
seen
alone
ever
enkindles
love
and
if
any
other
thing
seduce
your
love
it
is
naught
but
some
vestige
of
that
illrecognized
which
therein
shines
through
thou
wishest
to
know
if
for
a
defective
vow
so
much
can
be
rendered
with
other
service
as
may
secure
the
soul
from
suit
from
the
brightness
of
my
eyes
illuminated
by
the
divine
light
thus
beatrice
began
this
canto
and
even
as
one
who
breaks
not
off
his
speech
she
thus
continued
her
holy
discourse
the
greatest
gift
which
god
in
his
largess
bestowed
in
creating
and
the
most
conformed
unto
his
goodness
and
that
which
he
esteems
the
most
was
the
freedom
of
the
will
with
which
all
the
creatures
of
intelligence
and
they
alone
were
and
are
endowed
now
will
appear
to
thee
if
from
this
thou
reasonest
the
high
worth
of
the
vow
if
it
be
such
that
god
consent
when
thou
consentest
for
in
closing
the
compact
between
god
and
man
sacrifice
is
made
of
this
treasure
which
is
such
as
i
say
and
it
is
made
by
its
own
act
what
then
can
be
rendered
in
compensation
if
thou
thinkest
to
make
good
use
of
that
which
thou
hast
offered
with
illgotten
gain
thou
wouldst
do
good
work
if
the
vow
be
valid
through
its
acceptance
by
god
the
intent
to
put
what
had
been
vowed
to
another
though
good
use
affords
no
excuse
for
breaking
a
vow
thou
art
now
assured
of
the
greater
point
but
since
holy
church
in
this
gives
dispensation
which
seems
contrary
to
the
truth
which
i
have
disclosed
to
thee
it
behoves
thee
still
to
sit
a
little
at
table
because
the
tough
food
which
thou
hast
taken
requires
still
some
aid
for
thy
digestion
open
thy
mind
to
that
which
i
reveal
to
thee
and
enclose
it
therewithin
for
to
have
heard
without
retaining
doth
not
make
knowledge
two
things
combine
in
the
essence
of
this
sacrifice
the
one
is
that
of
which
it
consists
the
other
is
the
covenant
this
last
is
never
cancelled
if
it
be
not
kept
and
concerning
this
has
my
preceding
speech
been
so
precise
on
this
account
it
was
necessary
for
the
hebrews
still
to
make
offering
although
some
part
of
the
offering
might
be
changed
as
thou
shouldst
know
the
other
which
as
the
matter
is
known
to
thee
may
truly
be
such
that
one
errs
not
if
for
some
other
matter
it
be
changed
but
let
not
any
one
shift
the
load
upon
his
shoulder
at
his
own
will
without
the
turning
both
of
the
white
and
of
the
yellow
key
and
let
him
deem
every
permutation
foolish
if
the
thing
laid
down
be
not
included
in
the
thing
taken
up
as
four
in
six
therefore
whatever
thing
is
through
its
own
worth
of
such
great
weight
that
it
can
draw
down
every
balance
can
not
be
made
good
with
other
spending
see
leviticus
in
respect
to
commutation
allowed
that
is
as
the
subject
matter
of
the
vow
the
thing
of
which
sacrifice
is
made
without
the
turning
of
the
keys
of
peter
that
is
without
clerical
dispensation
the
key
of
gold
signifying
authority
that
of
silver
knowledge
cf
purgatory
canto
ix
the
matter
substituted
must
exceed
in
worth
that
of
the
original
vow
but
not
necessarily
in
a
definite
proportion
let
not
mortals
take
a
vow
in
jest
be
faithful
and
not
in
doing
this
as
jephthah
was
in
his
first
offering
to
whom
it
better
behoved
to
say
have
done
ill
than
by
keeping
his
vow
to
do
worse
and
thou
mayest
find
the
great
leader
of
the
greeks
in
like
manner
foolish
wherefore
iphigenia
wept
for
her
fair
face
and
made
weep
for
her
both
the
simple
and
the
wise
who
heard
speak
of
such
like
observance
be
ye
christians
more
grave
in
moving
be
not
like
a
feather
on
every
wind
and
think
not
that
every
water
can
wash
you
ye
have
the
old
and
the
new
testament
and
the
shepherd
of
the
church
who
guides
you
let
this
suffice
you
for
your
salvation
if
evil
covetousness
cry
aught
else
to
you
be
ye
men
and
not
silly
sheep
so
that
the
jew
among
you
may
not
laugh
at
you
act
not
like
the
lamb
that
leaves
the
milk
of
his
mother
and
simple
and
wanton
at
its
own
pleasure
combats
with
itself
see
judges
xi
thus
beatrice
to
me
even
as
i
write
then
all
desireful
turned
herself
again
to
that
region
where
the
world
is
most
alive
her
silence
and
her
transmuted
countenance
imposed
silence
on
my
eager
mind
which
already
had
new
questions
in
advance
and
even
as
an
arrow
that
hits
the
mark
before
the
bowstring
is
quiet
so
we
ran
into
the
second
realm
here
i
saw
my
lady
so
joyous
as
she
entered
into
the
light
of
that
heaven
that
thereby
the
planet
became
more
lucent
and
if
the
star
war
changed
and
smiled
what
did
i
become
who
even
by
my
nature
am
transmutable
in
every
wise
looking
upward
toward
the
empyrean
the
heaven
of
mercury
where
blessed
spirits
who
have
been
active
in
the
pursuit
of
honor
and
fame
show
themselves
as
in
a
fishpond
which
is
tranquil
and
pure
the
fish
draw
to
that
which
comes
from
without
in
such
manner
that
they
deem
it
their
food
so
indeed
i
saw
more
than
a
thousand
splendors
drawing
toward
us
and
in
each
one
was
heard
lo
one
who
shall
increase
our
loves
and
as
each
came
to
us
the
shade
was
seen
full
of
joy
in
the
bright
effulgence
that
issued
from
it
by
giving
us
occasion
to
manifest
our
love
think
reader
if
that
which
is
here
begun
should
not
proceed
how
thou
wouldst
have
distressful
want
of
knowing
more
and
by
thyself
thou
wilt
see
how
desirous
i
was
to
hear
from
these
of
their
conditions
as
they
became
manifest
to
mine
eyes
o
to
whom
grace
concedes
to
see
the
thrones
of
the
eternal
triumph
ere
the
warfare
is
abandoned
with
the
light
which
spreads
through
the
whole
heaven
we
are
enkindled
and
therefore
if
thou
desirest
to
make
thyself
clear
concerning
us
at
thine
own
pleasure
sate
thyself
thus
was
said
to
me
by
one
of
those
pious
spirits
and
by
beatrice
speak
speak
securely
and
trust
even
as
to
gods
i
see
clearly
how
thou
dost
nest
thyself
in
thine
ownlight
and
that
by
thine
eyes
thou
drawest
it
because
they
sparkle
when
thou
smilest
but
i
know
not
who
thou
art
nor
why
thou
hast
o
worthy
soul
thy
station
in
the
sphere
which
is
veiled
to
mortals
by
another
rays
this
i
said
addressed
unto
the
light
which
first
had
spoken
to
me
whereon
it
became
more
lucent
far
than
it
had
been
even
as
the
sun
which
when
the
heat
has
consumed
the
tempering
of
dense
vapors
conceals
itself
by
excess
of
light
so
through
greater
joy
the
holy
shape
bid
itself
from
me
within
its
own
radiance
and
thus
close
enclosed
it
answered
me
in
the
fashion
that
the
following
canto
sings
that
is
born
to
good
to
attain
blessedness
ere
thy
life
on
earth
as
a
member
of
the
church

itself

which
it
first
came
forth
and
there
governed
the
world
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
sacred
wings
from
hand
to
hand
and
thus
changing
unto
mine
own
arrived
caesar
i
was
and
am
justinian
who
through
will
of
the
primal
love
which
i
feel
drew
out
from
among
the
laws
what
was
superfluous
and
vain
and
before
i
was
intent
on
this
work
i
believed
one
nature
to
be
in
christ
not
more
and
with
such
faith
was
content
but
the
blessed
agapetus
who
was
the
supreme
pastor
directed
me
to
the
pure
faith
with
his
words
i
believed
him
and
that
which
was
in
his
faith
i
now
see
clearly
even
as
thou
seest
every
contradiction
to
be
both
false
and
true
soon
as
with
the
church
i
moved
my
feet
it
pleased
god
through
grace
to
inspire
me
with
the
high
labor
and
i
gave
myself
wholly
to
it
and
i
entrusted
my
armies
to
my
belisarius
to
whom
the
right
hand
of
heaven
was
so
joined
that
it
was
a
sign
that
i
should
take
repose
constantine

and
he
began
from
the

when

died
to
give
it
a

it
made
in

for

to
the

of

in

conquering
the

round

what
it
did
when
borne
by
the

against

against

against

chiefs
and
allies
whereby
torquatus
and

who
was
named
from

the

acquired
the

that
neither

it
wheeled
its

then
toward

and
smote
pharsalia
so
that
to

the

was
felt
it
saw
again
antandros

simois
whence
it
set
forth
and
there
where
hector
lies
and
ill
for
ptolemy
then
it
shook
itself
thence
it
swooped
flashing
down
on
juba
then
wheeled
again
unto
your
west
where
it
heard
the

trumpet
of

it
did

what

done
before

after
was
to
do
through
the
mortal
realm
that
is
subject

in

little

obscure

in

because
although

inasmuch
as
on
this
mark
there
is
much
gazing
and
little
is

i
will
tell
why
such
mode
was
most
worthy
the
divine
goodness

from
itself
spurns
all

sparkles

that
which
from
it
immediately
rains
down
is
wholly
free
because
it
is
not
subject
unto
the
power
of
the
new
things
it
is
the
most
conformed
to
it
and
therefore
pleases
it
the
most
for
the
holy
ardor
which
irradiates
every
thing
is
most
living
in
what
is
most
resemblance
to
itself
with
all
these
things
the
human
creature
is
advantaged
and
if
one
fail
he
needs
must
fall
from
his
nobility
sin
alone
is
that
which
disfranchises
him
and
makes
him
unlike
the
supreme
good
so
that
by
its
light
he
is
little
illumined
and
to
his
dignity
he
never
returns
unless
where
sin
makes
void
he
fill
up
for
evil
pleasures
with
just
penalties
your
nature
when
it
sinned
totally
in
its
seed
was
removed
from
these
dignities
even
as
from
paradise
nor
could
they
be
recovered
if
thou
considerest
full
subtly
by
any
way
without
passing
by
one
of
these
fords
either
that
god
alone
by
his
courtesy
should
forgive
or
that
man
by
himself
should
make
satisfaction
for
his
folly
fix
now
thine
eye
within
the
abyss
of
the
eternal
counsel
fixed
as
closely
on
my
speech
as
thou
art
able
man
within
his
own
limits
could
never
make
satisfaction
through
not
being
able
to
descend
so
far
with
humility
in
subsequent
obedience
as
disobeying
he
intended
to
ascend
and
this
is
the
reason
why
man
was
excluded
from
power
to
make
satisfaction
by
himself
therefore
it
behoved
god
by
his
own
paths
to
restore
man
to
his
entire
life
i
mean
by
one
or
else
by
both
but
because
the
work
of
the
workman
is
so
much

a
procedure
either
by
one
or
by

for
god
was
more
liberal
in
giving
himself
to
make
man
sufficient
to
lift
himself
up
again
than
if
only
of
himself
he
had
pardoned
him
and
all
the
other
modes
were
scanty
in
respect
to
justice

in

would
not

these
divine
lights
coming

the
circling

first
among
the
high
seraphim

within
those
who
appeared
most
in

was
sounding
hosanna
so
that
never
since
have
i
been
without
desire
of
hearing
it
again
then
one
came
nearer
to
us
and
alone
began

all
are
ready
to
thy
pleasure
that
thou
mayest
joy
in
us
with
one
circle
with
one
circling

with
one
thirst
we
revolve
with
the
celestial
princes
to
whom
thou
in

world
once
said
who
intelligent
move

we
are
so
full
of

to

thee
a

will
not

themselves

to

had
of
herself
made
them
contented

assured
they
turned
again
to
the
light
which
had
promised
so
much
and
tell
who
ye
are

my
utterance
stamped
with
great
affection
and
how
much
greater
alike
in
quantity
and
quality
did
i
see
it
become
through
the
new
gladness
which
was
added
to
its
gladnesses
when
i
spoke

thus
it
said
to
me
the
world
had
me
below
short
while
and
had
it
been
longer
much
evil
had
not
been
which
will
be
my
joy
which
rays
around
me
and
hides
me
like
a
creature
swathed
in
its
own
silk
holds
me
concealed
from
thee
much
didst
thou
love
me
and
thou
hadst
good
reason
for
had
i
stayed
below
i
had
showed
thee
of
my

he
would
already
put
to
flight
the

of

that
it

him
by

the
words
of

are
prophetic
of
the
evils
wrought
by
their
greed
officials
who
would
not
by
oppression
of
the
subjects
seek
their
private
gain
because
i
believe
that
the
deep
joy
which
thy
speech
my
lord
infuses
in
me
is
seen
by
thee
there
where
every
good
ends
and
begins
even
as
i
see
it
in
myself
it
is
the
more
grateful
to
me
and
this
also
i
hold
dear
that
thou
discernest
it
gazing
upon
god
thou
hast
made
me
glad
and
in
like
wise
do
thou
make
clear
to
me
since
in
speaking
thou
bast
moved
me
to
doubt
how
bitter
can
issue
from
sweet
seed
this
i
to
him
and
he
to
me
if
i
am
able
to
show
to
thee
a
truth
thou
wilt
hold
thy
face
to
that
which
thou
askest
as
thou
dost
hold
thy
back
the
good
which
turns
and
contents
all
the
realm
which
thou
ascendest
makes
its
providence
to
be
a
power
in
these
great
bodies
and
not
the
natures
only
are
foreseen
in
the
mind
which
by
itself
is
perfect
but
they
together
with
their
salvation
for
whatsoever
this
bow
shoots
falls
disposed
to
its
foreseen
end
even
as
a
thing
directed
to
its
aim
were
this
not
so
the
heavens
through
which
thou
journeyest
would
produce
their
effects
in
such
wise
that
they
would
not
be
works
of
art
but
ruins
and
that
can
not
be
if
the
intelligences
which
move
these
stars
are
not
defective
and
defective
also
the
prime
intelligence
which
has
not
made
them
perfect
dost
thou
wish
that
this
truth
be
made
still
clearer
to
thee
and
i
no
truly
because
i
see
it
to
be
impossible
that
nature
should
weary
in
that
which
is
needful
whereupon
he
again
now
say
would
it
be
worse
for
man
on
earth
if
he
were
not
a
citizen
yes
answered
i
and
here
i
ask
not
the
reason
and
can
he
be
so
unless
he
live
there
below
in
divers
manner
through
divers
offices
no
if
your
master
writes
well
of
this
so
he
went
on
deducing
far
as
here
then
he
concluded
hence
it
behoves
that
the
roots
of
your
works
must
be
diverse
wherefore
one
is
born
solon
and
another
xerxes
another
melchisedech
and
another
he
who
flying
through
the
air
lost
his
son
the
revolving
nature
which
is
the
seal
of
the
mortal
wax
performs
its
art
well
but
does
not
distinguish
one
inn
from
another
hence
it
happens
that
esau
differs
in
seed
from
jacob
and
quirinus
comes
from
so
mean
a
father
that
he
is
ascribed
to
mars
the
generated
nature
would
always
make
its
path
like
its
progenitors
if
the
divine
foresight
did
not
conquer
now
that
which
was
behind
thee
is
before
thee
but
that
thou
mayest
know
that
i
have
joy
in
thee
i
wish
that
thou
cloak
thee
with
a
corollary
nature
if
she
find
fortune
discordant
with
herself
like
every
other
seed
out
of
its
region
always
makes
bad
result
and
if
the
world
down
there
would
fix
attention
on
the
foundation
which
nature
lays
following
that
it
would
have
its
people
good
but
ye
wrest
to
religion
one
who
shall
be
born
to
gird
on
the
sword
and
ye
make
a
king
of
one
who
is
for
preaching
wherefore
your
track
is
out
of
the
road
is
seen
in
the
mind
of
god
my
own
joy
is
the
dearer
in
that
thou
seest
that
it
is
more
grateful
to
me
because
known
by
thee
the
providence
of
god
is
fulfilled
through
the
influences
of
the
heavens
acting
upon
the
natures
subject
to
them
that
is
together
with
the
good
ends
for
which
they
are
created
and
ordained
defect
in
the
subordinate
intelligences
would
imply
defect
in
god
which
is
impossible
it
is
impossible
that
the
order
of
nature
should
fail
that
order
being
the
design
of
god
in
creation
that
is
united
with
other
men
in
society
because
man
is
by
nature
a
social
animal
and
can
not
attain
his
true
end
except
as
a
member
of
a
community
society
can
not
exist
without
diversity
in
the
functions
of
its
members
aristotle
the
master
of
human
reason
who
treats
of
this
in
many
places
for
instance
in
his
ethics
i
where
he
speaks
of
man
as
by
nature
social
so
that
his
end
is
accomplished
only
in
society
human
dispositions
the
roots
of
human
works
must
be
diverse
in
order
to
produce
diverse
effects
the
spheres
pour
down
their
various
influences
without
discrimination
in
the
choice
of
the
individual
upon
whom
they
fall
hence
sons
may
differ
in
their
dispositions
from
their
fathers
this
additional
statement
completes
the

completes
the
clothing
of

with

told
to
me
of
the
treasons
which
his

must
suffer

he
said
be
silent
and
let
the

revolve
so
that
i

nothing

that
just
lament
shall
follow
on
your
wrongs
the

those
who
have
done
the
wrong
shall
justly
lament
therefor
and
now
the

from
such
good
turn
away
your
hearts
directing
your

another
of

in
brightening
outwardly

were
fixed

pray
thee
give
swift
quittance

the

pardon
to
myself
the

ere

this

on

darkens
outwardly

sees
everything

is

why

saw

may
fly

even
as
i
am
resplendent
with
its
radiance
so
looking
into
the
eternal
light
i
apprehend
whence
thou
drawest
the
occasion
of
thy
thoughts
thou
art
perplexed
and
hast
the
wish
that
my
speech
be
bolted
again
in
language
so
open
and
so
plain
that
it
may
be
level
to
thy
sense
where
just
now
i
said
well
one
fattens
and
there
where
i
said
second
has
not
been
born
and
here
is
need
that
one
distinguish
well
each
of
the
lights
which
had
encircled
beatrice
and
dante
the
providence
which
governs
the
world
with
that
counsel
in
which
every
created
vision
is
vanquished
ere
it
reach
the
depth
in
order
that
the
bride
of
him
who
with
loud
cries
espoused
her
with
his
blessed
blood
might
go
toward
her
beloved
secure
in
herself
and
also
more
faithful
to
him
ordained
two
princes
in
her
favor
who
on
this
side
and
that
should
be
to
her
for
guides
the
one
was
all
seraphic
in
ardor
the
other
through
wisdom
was
a
splendor
of
cherubic
light
on
earth
of
the
one
i
will
speak
because
both
are
spoken
of
in
praising
one
whichever
be
taken
for
unto
one
end
were
their
works
the
church
francis
of
assisi
dominic
between
the
tupino
and
the
water
which
descends
from
the
hill
chosen
by
the
blessed
ubaldo
hangs
the
fertile
slope
of
a
high
mountain
wherefrom
perugia
at
porta
sole
feeleth
cold
and
heat
while
behind
it
nocera
and
gualdo
weep
because
of
their
heavy
yoke
on
that
slope
where
it
most
breaks
its
steepness
rose
a
sun
upon
the
world
as
this
one
sometimes
does
from
the
ganges
therefore
let
him
who
talks
of
that
place
not
say
ascesi
for
he
would
speak
short
but
orient
if
be
would
speak
properly
he
was
not
yet
very
far
from
his
rising
when
he
began
to
make
the
earth
feel
some
comfort
from
his
great
virtue
for
still
a
youth
he
ran
to
strife
with
his
father
for
a
lady
such
as
unto
whom
even
as
unto
death
no
one
unlocks
the
gate
of
pleasure
and
before
his
spiritual
court
et
coram
patre
to
her
he
had
himself
united
thereafter
from
day
to
day
he
loved
her
more
ardently
she
deprived
of
her
first
husband
for
one
thousand
and
one
hundred
years
and
more
despised
and
obscure
had
stood
without
wooing
till
he
came
nor
had
it
availed
to
hear
that
he
who
caused
fear
to
all
the
world
found
her
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
secure
with
amyclas
nor
had
it
availed
to
have
been
constant
and
bold
so
that
where
mary
remained
below
she
wept
with
christ
upon
the
cross
but
that
i
may
not
proceed
too
obscurely
take
henceforth
in
my
diffuse
speech
francis
and
poverty
for
these
lovers
their
concord
and
their
glad
semblances
made
love
and
wonder
and
sweet
regard
to
be
the
cause
of
holy
thoughts
so
that
the
venerable
bernard
first
bared
his
feet
and
ran
following
such
great
peace
and
running
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
slow
oh
unknown
riches
oh
fertile
good
egidius
bares
his
feet
and
sylvester
bares
his
feet
following
the
bridegroom
so
pleasing
is
the
bride
then
that
father
and
that
master
goes
on
his
way
with
his
lady
and
with
that
family
which
the
humble
cord
was
now
girding
nor
did
baseness
of
heart
weigh
down
his
brow
at
being
son
of
pietro
bernardone
nor
at
appearing
marvellously
despised
but
royally
he
opened
his
bard
intention
to
innocent
and
received
from
bim
the
first
seal
for
his
order
after
the
poor
people
had
increased
behind
him
whose
marvellous
life
would
be
better
sung
in
glory
of
the
heavens
the
holy
purpose
of
this
archimandrite
was
adorned
with
a
second
crown
by
the
eternal
spirit
through
honorius
and
when
through
thirst
for
martyrdom
he
had
preached
christ
and
the
rest
who
followed
him
in
the
proud
presence
of
the
sultan
and
because
he
found
the
people
too
unripe
for
conversion
and
in
order
not
to
stay
in
vain
had
returned
to
the
fruit
of
the
italian
grass
on
the
rude
rock
between
the
tiber
and
the
arno
he
took
from
christ
the
last
seal
which
his
limbs
bore
for
two
years
when
it
pleased
him
who
had
allotted
him
to
such
great
good
to
draw
him
up
to
the
reward
which
he
had
gained
in
making
himself
abject
he
commended
his
most
dear
lady
to
his
brethren
as
to
rightful
heirs
and
commanded
them
to
love
her
faithfully
and
from
her
lap
his
illustrious
soul
willed
to
depart
returning
to
its
realm
and
for
his
body
he
willed
no
other
bier
the
chiassi
which
flows
from
the
hill
chosen
for
his
hermitage
by
ubaldo
the
gate
of
perugia
which
fronts
monte
subasio
on
which
assisi
lies
some
fifteen
miles
to
the
south
towns
southeast
of
assisi
oppressed
by
their
rulers
so
the
name

was
sometimes
spelled

the

be

himself
to

in

of
his

worldly
possessions

born
in
to
procure
suitors
for
her
when
caesar
knocked
at
the
door
of

no

because
poverty
made
the

the
hearts
of
those
who
behold
them
the
followers
of
francis
imitated
him
in
going
barefoot

their
only

because
his

was
neither

the
stigmata
francis
died
in
think
now
of
what
sort
was
he
who
was
a
worthy
colleague
to
keep
the
bark
of
peter
on
the
deep
sea
to
its
right
aim
and
this
was
our
patriarch
wherefore
thou
canst
see
that
whoever
follows
him
as
he
commands
loads
good
merchandise
but
his
flock
has
become
so
greedy
of
strange
food
that
it
can
not
but
be
scattered
over
diverse
meadows
and
as
his
sheep
remote
and
vagabond
go
farther
from
him
the
emptier
of
milk
they
return
to
the
fold
truly
there
are
some
of
them
who
fear
the
harm
and
keep
close
to
the
shepherd
but
they
are
so
few
that
little
cloth
suffices
for
their
cowls
now
if
my
words
are
not
obscure
if
thy
hearing
has
been
attentive
if
thou
recallest
to
mind
that
which
i
have
said
thy
wish
will
be
content
in
part
because
thou
wilt
see
the
plant
wherefrom
they
are
hewn
and
thou
wilt
see
how
the
wearer
of
the
thong
reasons
well
one
fattens
if
one
does
not
stray
how
holy
he
must
have
been
dominic
the
plant
of
which
the
words
are
splinters
or
chips
in
other
terms
thou
wilt
understand
the
whole
ground
of
my
assertion
and
thou
wilt
see
what
a
dominican
wearer
of
the
leather
thong
of
the
order
means
when
he
says
that
the
flock
of
dominic
fatten
if
they
stray
not
from
the
road
on
which
he
leads
them
canto
xii
second
circle
of
the
spirits
of
wise
religious
men
doctors
of
the
church
and
st
bonaventura
narrates
the
life
of
dominic
and
tells
the
names
of
those
who
form
the
circle
with
him
soon
as
the
blessed
flame
uttered
the
last
word
of
its
speech
the
holy
began
to
rotate
and
had
not
wholly
turned
in
its
gyration
before
another
enclosed
it
with
a
circle
and
matched
motion
with
motion
song
with
song
song
which
in
those
sweet
pipes
so
surpasses
our
muses
our
sirens
as
a
primal
splendor
that
which
it
reflects
as
two
bows
parallel
and
of
like
colors
are
turned
across
a
thin
cloud
when
juno
gives
the
order
to
her
handmaid
the
outer
one
born
of
that
within
after
the
manner
of
the
speech
of
that
wandering
one
whom
love
consumed
as
the
sun
does
vapors
and
make
the
people
here
presageful
because
of
the
covenant
which
god
established
with
noah
concerning
the
world
that
it
is
nevermore
to
be
flooded
so
the
two
garlands
of
those
sempiternal
roses
turned
around
us
and
so
the
outer
responded
to
the
inner
after
the
dance
and
the
other
great
festivity
alike
of
the
singing
and
of
the
flaming
light
with
light
joyous
and
courteous
had
become
quiet
together
at
an
instant
and
with
one
will
just
as
the
eyes
which
must
needs
together
close
and
open
to
the
pleasure
that
moves
them
from
the
heart
of
one
of
the
new
lights
a
voice
proceeded
which
made
me
seem
as
the
needle
to
the
star
in
turning
me
to
its
place
and
it
began
the
love
which
makes
me
beautiful
draws
me
to
speak
of
the
other
leader
by
whom
so
well
has
been
spoken
here
of
mine
it
is
fit
that
where
one
is
the
other
be
led
in
so
that
as
they
served
in
war
with
one
another
together
likewise
may
their
glory
shine
the
garland
of
spirits
encircling
beatrice
and
dante
as
an
original
ray
is
brighter
than
one
reflected
iris
echo
it
is
bonaventura
the
biographer
of
francis
who
speaks
he
became
general
of
the
order
in
and
died
in
by
whom
through
one
of
his
brethren
the
army
of
christ
which
it
had
cost
so
dear
to
arm
afresh
was
moving
slow
mistrustful
and
scattered
behind
the
standard
when
the
emperor
who
forever
reigns
provided
for
the
soldiery
that
was
in
peril
through
grace
alone
not
because
it
was
worthy
and
as
has
been
said
succored
his
bride
with
two
champions
by
whose
deed
by
whose
word
the
people
gone
astray
were
rallied
the
elect
who
had
lost
grace
through
adam
sin
were
armed
afresh
by
the
costly
sacirifice
of
the
son
of
god
the
cross
in
that
region
where
the
sweet
west
wind
rises
to
open
the
new
leaves
wherewith
europe
is
seen
to
reclothe
herself

very
far
from

over

the

bides
himself

born
the
amorous
lover
of
the
christian
faith
the
holy
athlete
benignant
to
his
own
and
to
his
enemies
harsh
and
when
it
was
created
his
mind
was
so
replete
with
living
virtue
that
in
his
mother
it
made
her
a
prophetess
after
the
espousals
between
him
and
the
faith
were
completed
at
the
sacred
font
where
they
dowered
each
other
with
mutual
safety
the
lady
who
gave
the
assent
for
him
saw
in
a
dream
the
marvellous
fruit
which
was
to
proceed
from
him
and
from
his
heirs
and
in
order
that
he
might
be
spoken
of
as
he
was
a
spirit
went
forth
from
here
to
name
him
with
the
possessive
of
him
whose
he
wholly
was
dominic
he
was
called
and
i
speak
of
him
as
of
the
husbandman
whom
christ
elected
to
his
garden
to
assist
him
truly
he
seemed
the
messenger
and
familiar
of
christ
for
the
first
love
that
was
manifest
in
him
was
for
the
first
counsel
that
christ
gave
oftentimes
was
he
found
by
his
nurse

awake

said

born
in

dreamed
that
she
gave
birth
to
a

in
color

a
lighted

its
mouth

set

of
the
black

of

for
the
love

the
true

became
in
short
time
a
great
teacher
such
that
he
set
himself
to
go
about
the
vineyard

quickly
fades
if
the
vinedresser
is
bad
and
of
the
seat
which
was
formerly
more
benign
unto
the
righteous
poor
not
through
itself
but
through
him
who
sits
there
and
degenerates
he
asked
not

with

went
forth

a
lofty

out

on

onset
smote
with
most
vigor

that

is
due
not
to
the
fault
of

strife
surely
the
excellence
of

should
be
very
plain
to
thee
concerning
which
thomas
before
my
coming
was
so
courteous

the

the

canto
xiii
thomas
aquinas
speaks
again
and
explains
the
relation
of
the
wisdom
of
solomon
to
that
of
adam
and
of
christ
and
declares
the
vanity
of
human
judgment
let
him
imagine
who
desires
to
understand
well
that
which
i
now
saw
and
let
him
retain
the
image
like
a
firm
rock
while
i
am
speaking
fifteen
stars
which
in
different
regions
vivify
the
heaven
with
brightness
so
great
that
it
overcomes
all
thickness
of
the
air
let
him
imagine
that
wain
for
which
the
bosom
of
our
heaven
suffices
both
night
and
day
so
that
in
the
turning
of
its
pole
it
disappears
not
let
him
imagine
the
mouth
of
that
horn
which
begins
at
the
point
of
the
axle
on
which
the
primal
wheel
goes
round
to
have
made
of
themselves
two
signs
in
the
heavens
like
that
which
the
daughter
of
minos
made
when
she
felt
the
frost
of
death
and
one
to
have
its
rays
within
the
other
and
both
to
revolve
in
such
manner
that
one
should
go
first
and
the
other
after
and
he
will
have
as
it
were
the
shadow
of
the
true
constellation
and
of
the
double
dance
which
was
circling
the
point
where
i
was
because
it
is
as
much
beyond
our
wont
as
the
motion
of
the
heaven
which
outspeeds
all
the
rest
is
swifter
than
the
movement
of
the
chiana
there
was
sung
riot
bacchus
not
paean
but
three
persons
in
a
divine
nature
and
it
and
the
human
in
one
person
the
singing
and
the
revolving
completed
each
its
measure
and
those
holy
lights
gave
attention
to
us
making
themselves
happy
from
care
to
care
to
form
an
idea
of
the
brightness
of
the
two
circles
of
spirits
let
the
reader
imagine
fifteen
of
the
brightest
separate
stars
joined
with
the
seven
stars
of
the
great
bear
and
with
the
two
brightest
of
the
lesser
bear
to
form
two
constellations
like
ariadne
crown
and
to
revolve
one
within
the
other
one
following
the
movement
of
the
other
charles
wain
the
great
bear
which
never
sets
the
lesser
bear
may
be
imagined
as
having
the
shape
of
a
horn
of
which
the
small
end
is
near
the
pole
of
the
heavens
around
which
the
primum
mobile
revolves
when
ariadne
died
of
grief
because
of
her
desertion
by
theseus
her
garland
was
changed
into
the
constellation
known
as
ariadne
crown
the
chiana
is
one
of
the
most
sluggish
of
the
streams
of
tuscany
rejoicing
in
the
change
from
dance
and
song
to
tranquillity
for
the
sake
of
giving
satisfaction
to
dante
then
the
light
in
which
the
marvellous
life
of
the
poor
man
of
god
had
been
narrated
to
me
broke
the
silence
among
those
concordant
deities
and
said
since
one
straw
is
threshed
since
its
seed
is
now
garnered
sweet
love
invites
me
to
beat
out
the
other
thou
believest
that
in
the
breast
wherefrom
the
rib
was
drawn
to
form
the
beautiful
cheek
whose
taste
costs
dear
to
all
the
world
and
in
that
which
pierced
by
the
lance
both
after
and
before
made
such
satisfaction
that
it
overcomes
the
balance
of
all
sin
whatever
of
light
it
is
allowed
to
human
nature
to
have
was
all
infused
by
that
power
which
made
one
and
the
other
and
therefore
thou
wonderest
at
that
which
i
said
above
when
i
told
that
the
good
which
in
the
fifth
light
is
inclosed
had
no
second
now
open
thine
eyes
to
that
which
i
answer
to
thee
and
thou
wilt
see
thy
belief
and
my
speech
become
in
the
truth
as
the
centre
in
a
circle
that
which
dies
not
and
that
which
can
die
are
naught
but
the
splendor
of
that
idea
which
in
his
love
our
lord
god
brings
to
birth
for
that
living
light
which
so
proceeds
from
its
lucent
source
that
it
is
not
disunited
from
it
nor
from
the
love
which
with
them
is
intrined
through
its
own
bounty
collects
its
radiance
as
it
were
mirrored
in
nine
subsistences
itself
eternally
remaining
one
thence
it
descends
to
the
ultimate
potentialities
downward
from
act
to
act
becoming
such
that
finally
it
makes
naught
save
brief
contingencies
and
these
contingencies
i
understand
to
be
the
generated
things
which
the
heavens
in
their
motion
produce
with
seed
and
without
the
wax
of
these
and
that
which
moulds
it
are
not
of
one
mode
and
therefore
under
the
ideal
stamp
it
shines
now
more
now
less
whence
it
comes
to
pass
that
one
same
plant
in
respect
to
species
bears
better
or
worse
fruit
and
that
ye
are
born
with
diverse
dispositions
if
the
wax
were
exactly
worked
and
the
heavens
were
supreme
in
their
power
the
whole
light
of
the
seal
would
be
apparent
but
nature
always
gives
it
defective
working
like
the
artist
who
has
the
practice
of
his
art
and
a
hand
that
trembles
nevertheless
if
the
fervent
love
disposes
and
imprints
the
clear
light
of
the
primal
power
complete
perfection
is
acquired
here
thus
of
old
the
earth
was
made
worthy
of
the
complete
perfection
of
the
living
being
thus
was
the
virgin
made
impregnate
so
that
i
commend
thy
opinion
that
human
nature
never
was
nor
will
be
what
it
was
in
those
two
persons
the
creation
of
things
eternal
and
things
temporal
alike
is
the
splendid
manifestation
of
the
idea
which
the
triune
god
in
his
love
generated
the
living
light
in
the
son
emanating
from
its
lucent
source
in
the
father
in
union
with
the
love
of
the
holy
spirit
the
three
remaining
always
one
pours
out
its
radiance
through
the
nine
orders
of
the
angelic
hierarchy
who
distribute
it
by
means
of
the
heavens
of
which
they
axe
the
intelligences
through
the
various
movements
and
conjunctions
of
the
heavens
the
creative
light
descends
to
the
lowest
elements
producing
all
the
varieties
of
contingent
things
the
material
of
contingent
or
temporal
things
and
the
influences
which
shape
them
are
of
various
sort
so
that
the
splendor
of
the
divine
idea
is
visible
in
them
in
different
degree
if
the
material
were
always
fit
to
receive
the
impression
nature
the
second
cause
never
transmits
the
whole
of
the
creative
light
if
however
the
first
cause
acts
directly
the
fervent
love
imprinting
the
clear
light
of
the
primal
power
there
can
be
no
imperfection
in
the
created
thing
it
answers
to
the
divine
idea
thus
by
the
immediate
operation
of
the
creator
the
earth
of
which
adam
was
formed
was
made
the
perfect
material
for
the
f
ormation
of
the
creature
with
a
living
soul
in
like
manner
by
the
direct
act
of
the
creator
now
if
i
should
not
proceed
further
how
was
this
man
without
peer
would
thy
words
begin
but
in
order
that
that
which
is
not
apparent
may
clearly
appear
consider
who
he
was
and
the
occasion
which
moved
him
to
request
when
it
was
said
to
him
i
have
not
so
spoken
that
thou
canst
not
clearly
see
that
he
was
a
king
who
asked
for
wisdom
in
order
that
he
might
be
a
worthy
king
not
to
know
the
number
of
the
motors
here
on
high
or
if
necesse
with
a
contingent
ever
made
necesse
non
si
est
dare
primum
motum
esse
or
if
in
the
semicircle
a
triangle
can
be
made
so
that
it
should
not
have
one
right
angle
wherefore
if
thou
notest
this
and
what
i
said
a
kingly
prudence
is
that
peerless
seeing
on
which
the
arrow
of
ray
intention
strikes
and
if
thou
directest
clear
eyes
to
the
arisen
thou
wilt
see
it
has
respect
only
to
kings
who
are
many
and
the
good
are
few
with
this
distinction
take
thou
my
saying
and
thus
it
can
stand
with
that
which
thou
believest
of
the
first
father
and
of
our
delight
and
let
this
be
ever
as
lead
to
thy
feet
to
make
thee
move
slow
as
a
weary
man
both
to
the
yes
and
to
the
no
which
thou
seest
not
for
he
is
very
low
among
the
fools
who
affirms
or
denies
without
distinction
alike
in
the
one
and
in
the
other
case
because
it
happens
that
oftentimes
the
current
opinion
bends
in
false
direction
and
then
the
inclination
binds
the
understanding
far
more
than
vainly
does
he
leave
the
bank
since
he
returns
not
such
as
be
sets
out
who
fishes
for
the
truth
and
has
not
the
art
and
of
this
are
manifest
proofs
to
the
world
parmenides
melissus
bryson
and
many
others
who
went
on
and
knew
not
whither
so
did
sabellius
and
arius
and
those
fools
who
were
as
swords
unto
the
scriptures
in
making
their
straight
faces
crooked
let
not
the
people
still
be
too
secure
in
judgment
like
him
who
reckons
up
the
blades
in
the
field
ere
they
are
ripe
for
i
have
seen
the
briar
first
show
itself
stiff
and
wild
all
winter
long
then
bear
the
rose
upon
its
top
and
i
have
seen
a
bark
ere
now
ran
straight
and
swift
across
the
sea
through
all
its
course
to
perish
at
last
at
entrance
of
the
harbor
let
not
dame
bertha
and
master
martin
seeing
one
rob
and
another
make
offering
believe
to
see
them
within
the
divine
counsel
for
the
one
may
rise
and
the
other
may
fall
if
from
two
premises
one
necessary
and
one
contingent
a
necessary
conclusion
is
to
be
deduced
if
a
prime
motion
is
to
be
assumed
that
is
a
motion
not
the
effect
of
another
he
did
not
ask
through
idle
curiosity
to
know
the
number
of
the
angels
nor
for
the
solution
of
a
logical
puzzle
nor
for
that
of
a
question
in
metaphysics
or
of
a
problem
in
geometry
if
thou
understandest
this
comment
on
my
former
words
to
see
so
much
no
second
has
arisen
my
meaning
will
be
clear
that
his
vision
was
unmatched
in
respect
to
the
wisdom
which
it
behoves
a
king
to
possess
thus
distinguishing
it
is
apparent
that
solomon
is
not
brought
into
comparison
in
respect
to
perfection
of
wisdom
with
adam
or
with
christ
christ
because
he
returns
not
only
but
with
his
mind
perverted
heathen
philosophers
who
went
astray
in
seeking
for
the
truth
sabellius
denied
the
trinity
arius
denied
the
consubstantiality
of
the
word
to
understand
the
mystery
of
predestination
canto
xiv
at
the
prayer
of
beatrice
solomon
tells
of
the
glorified
body
of
the
blessed
after
the
last
ascent
to
the
heaven
of
souls
of
the
soldiery
of
christ
in
the
form
of
a
cross
with
the
figure
of

hymn
of
the
spirits
from

to

rim
and
so
from
the
rim
to
the
centre
the
water
in
a
round
vessel
moves
according
as
it
is
struck
from
without
or
within
this
which
i
say
fell
suddenly
into
my
mind
when
the
glorious
life
of
thomas
became
silent
because
of
the
similitude
which
was
born
of
his
speech
and
that
of
beatrice
whom
after
him
it
pleased
thus
to
begin
this
man
has
need
and
he
tells
it
not
to
you
neither
with
his
voice
nor
as
yet
in
thought
of
going
to
the
root
of
another
truth
tell
him
if
the
light
wherewith
your
substance
blossoms
will
remain
with
you
eternally
even
as
it
is
now
and
if
it
remain
tell
how
after
you
shall
be
again
made
visible
it
will
be
possible
that
it
hurt
not
your
sight
thomas
had
spoken
from
his
place
in
the
ring
which
formed
a
circle
around
beatrice
and
dante
beatrice
now
was
speaking
from
the
centre
where
she
stood
the
souls
of
the
blessed
are
hidden
in
the
light
which
emanates
from
them
after
the
resurrection
of
the
body
they
will
become
visible
but
then
how
will
the
bodily
eyes
endure
such
brightness
as
when
urged
and
drawn
by
greater
pleasure
those
who
are
dancing
in
a
ring
with
one
accord
lift
their
voice
and
gladden
their
motions
so
at
that
prompt
and
devout
petition
the
holy
circles
showed
new
joy
in
their
turning
and
in
their
marvellous
melody
whoso
laments
because
man
dies
here
in
order
to
live
thereabove
has
not
seen
here
the
refreshment
of
the
eternal
rain
that
one
and
two
and
three
which
ever
lives
and
ever
reigns
in
three
and
two
and
one
uncircumscribed
and
circumscribing
everything
was
thrice
sung
by
each
of
those
spirits
with
such
a
melody
that
for
every
merit
it
would
be
a
just
reward
and
i
heard
in
the
divinest
light
of
the
small
circle
a
modest
voice
perhaps
such
as
was
that
of
the
angel
to
mary
make
answer
as
long
as
the
festival
of
paradise
shall
be
so
long
will
our
love
radiate
around
us
such
a
garment
its
brightness
follows
our
ardor
the
ardor
our
vision
and
that
is
great
in
proportion
as
it
receives
of
grace
above
its
own
worth
when
the
glorious
and
sanctified
flesh
shall
be
put
on
us
again
our
persons
will
be
more
pleasing
through
being
all
complete
wherefore
whatever
of
gratuitous
light
the
supreme
good
gives
us
will
be
increased
light
which
enables
us
to
see
him
so
that
our
vision
needs
must
increase
our
ardor
increase
which
by
that
is
kindled
our
radiance
increase
which
comes
from
this
but
even
as
a
coal
which
gives
forth
flame
and
by
a
vivid
glow
surpasses
it
so
that
it
defends
its
own
aspect
thus
this
effulgence
which
already
encircles
us
will
be
vanquished
in
appearance
by
the
flesh
which
all
this
while
the
earth
covers
nor
will
so
great

for
everything
which
shall
have
power
to
delight
us
so
sudden
and
ready
both
one
and
the
other
choir
seemed
to
me
in
saying
amen
that
truly
they
showed
desire
for
their
dead
bodies
perhaps
not
only
for
themselves
but
also
for
their
mothers
for
their
fathers
and
for
the
others
who
were
dear
before
they
became
sempiternal
flames
probably
that
of
solomon
who
in
the
tenth
canto
is
said
to
be
the
light
which
is
the
most
beautiful
among
us
the
coal
is
seen
glowing
through
the
flame
and
lo
round
about
of
a
uniform
brightness
arose
a
lustre
outside
that
which
was
there
like
an
horizon
which
is
growing
bright
and
even
as
at
rise
of
early
evening
new
appearances
begin
in
the
heavens
so
that
the
sight
seems
and
seems
not
true
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
i
began
to
see
new
subsistences
and
a
circle
forming
outside
the
other
two
circumferences
o
true
sparkling
of
the
holy
spirit
how
sudden
and
glowing
it
became
to
mine
eyes
which
vanquished
endured
it
not
but
beatrice
showed
herself
to
me
so
beautiful
and
smiling
that
she
must
be
left
among
those
sights
which
have
not
followed
my
memory
thence
my
eyes
regained
power
to
raise
themselves
again
and
i
saw
myself
alone
with
my
lady
transferred
to
higher
salvation
that
i
was
more
uplifted
i
perceived
clearly
by
the
fiery
smile
of
the
star
which
seemed
to
me
ruddier
than
its
wont
with
all
my
heart
and
with
that
speech
which
is
one
in
all
men
i
made
to
god
a
holocaust
such
as
was
befitting
to
the
new
grace
and
the
ardor
of
the
sacrifice
was
not
yet
exhausted
in
my
breast
when
i
knew
that
offering
had
been
accepted
and
propitious
for
with
such
great
glow
and
such
great
ruddiness
splendors
appeared
to
me
within
two
rays
that
i
said
o
helios
who
dost
so
array
them
to
a
higher
grade
of
blessedness
that
of
the
fifth
heaven
the
unuttered
voice
of
the
soul
whether
dante
forms
this
word
from
the
hebrew
eli
my
god
or
adopts
the
greek

even
as

out
by

greater

the

so
whitens
between
the
poles
of
the
world
that
it
indeed
makes
the
wise
to
doubt
thus
constellated
in
the
depth
of

those
rays
made
the
venerable
sign
which
joinings
of
quadrants
in

circle
make
here
my
memory
overcomes
my
genius
for
that

flashing
forth

so
that
i
know
not
to
find
worthy
comparison
but
be
who
takes
his

and
follows

will
yet
excuse
me
for
that

between

lights
were
moving
brightly
scintillating
as
they
met

in

passing
by
thus
here
are
seen
straight
and
athwart
swift
and
slow
changing
appearance
the
atoms
of
bodies
long
and
short
moving
through
the
sunbeam
wherewith
sometimes
the
shade
is
striped
which
people
contrive
with
skill
and
art
for
their
protection
and
as
a
viol
or
harp
strung
in
harmony
of
many
strings
makes
a
sweet
tinkling
to
one
by
whom
the
tune
is
not
caught
thus
from
the
lights
which
there
appeared
to
me
a
melody
was
gathered
through
the
cross
which
rapt
me
without
understanding
of
the
hymn
truly
was
i
aware
that
it
was
of
holy
praise
because
there
came
to
me
arise
and
conquer
as
unto
one
who
understands
not
and
yet
bears
i
was
so
enamoured
therewith
that
until
then
had
not
been
anything
which
had
fettered
me
with
such
sweet
bonds
perchance
my
word
appears
too
daring
in
setting
lower
the
pleasure
from
the
beautiful
eyes
gazing
into
which
my
desire
has
repose
but
he
who
considers
that
the
living
seals
of
every
beauty
have
more
effect
the
higher
they
are
and
that
i
there
had
not
turned
round
to

eyes
can
excuse
me
for
that
whereof
i
accuse
myself
in
order
to
excuse
myself
and
see
that
i
speak
truth
for
the
holy
pleasure
is
not
here
excluded
because
it
becomes
the
purer
as
it

had
felt
no
joy
equal
to
that
afforded
him
by
this
song
but
a
still
greater
joy
awaited
him
in
the
eyes
of
beatrice
to
which
since
he
entered
the
fifth
heaven
he
had
not
turned
but
which
there
as

were
to
afford

dante
is
welcomed
by
his
ancestor
cacciaguida
tells
of
his
family
and
of
the
simple
life
of
florence
in
the
old
days
a
benign
will
wherein
the
love
which
righteously
inspires
always
manifests
itself
as
cupidity
does
in
the
evil
will
imposed
silence
on
that
sweet
lyre
and
quieted
the
holy
strings
which
the
right
hand
of
heaven
slackens
and
draws
tight
how
unto
just
petitions
shall
those
substances
be
deaf
who
in
order
to
give
me
wish
to
pray
unto
them
were
concordant
in
silence
well
is
it
that
be
endlessly
should
grieve
who
for
the
love
of
thing
which
endures
not
eternally
despoils
him
of
that
love
as
through
the
tranquil
and
pure
evening
skies
a
sudden
fire
shoots
from
time
to
time
moving
the
eyes
which
were
at
rest
and
seems
to
be
a
star
which
changes
place
except
that
from
the
region
where
it
is
kindled
nothing
is
lost
and
it
lasts
short
while
so
from
the
arm
which
extends
on
the
right
to
the
foot
of
that
cross
ran
a
star
of
the
constellation
which
is
resplendent
there
nor
from
its
ribbon
did
the
gem
depart
but
through
the
radial
strip
it
ran
along
and
seemed
like
fire
behind
alabaster
thus
did
the
pious
shade
of
anchises
advance
if
our
greatest
muse
merits
belief
when
in
elysium
he
perceived
his
son
and
he
anchises
when
he
saw
aeneas
advancing
to
meet
him
over
the
grass
stretched
forth
both
hands
eagerly
and
the
tears
poured
down
his
cheeks
and
he
cried
out
thou
come
at
length
aeneid
vi
o
sanguis
meus
o
superinfusa
gratia
dei
sicut
tibi
cui
bis
unquam
coeli
janua
reclusa
thus
that
light
whereat
i
gave
heed
to
it
then
i
turned
my
sight
to
my
lady
and
on
this
side
and
that
i
was
wonderstruck
for
within
her
eyes
was
glowing
such
a
smile
that
with
my
own
i
thought
to
touch
the
depth
of
my
grace
and
of
my
paradise
o
blood
of
mine
o
grace
of
god
poured
from
above
to
whom
as
to
thee
was
ever
the
gate
of
heaven
twice
opened
then
gladsome
to
hear
and
to
see
the
spirit
joined
to
his
beginning
things
which
i
understood
not
he
spoke
so
profoundly
nor
did
he
hide
himself
to
me
by
choice
but
by
necessity
for
his
conception
was
set
above
the
mark
of
mortals
and
when
the
bow
of
his
ardent
affection
was
so
relaxed
that
his
speech
descended
towards
the
mark
of
our
understanding
the
first
thing
that
was
understood
by
me
was
blessed
be
thou
trinal
and
one
who
in
my
offspring
art
so
courteous
and
he
went
on
grateful
and
long
hunger
derived
from
reading
in
the
great
vouime
where
white
or
dark
is
never
changed
thou
hast
relieved
my
son
within
this
light
in
which
i
speak
to
thee
thanks
to
her
who
clothed
thee
with
plumes
for
the
lofty
flight
thou
believest
that
thy
thought
flows
to
me
from
that
which
is
first
even
as
from
the
unit
if
that
be
known
ray
out
the
five
and
six
and
therefore
who
i
am
and
why
i
appear
to
thee
more
joyous
than
any
other
in
this
glad
crowd
thou
askest
me
not
thou
believest
the
truth
for
the
less
and
the
great
of
this
life
gaze
upon
the
mirror
in
which
before
thou
thinkest
thou
dost
display
thy
thought
but
in
order
that
the
sacred
love
in
which
i
watch
with
perpetual
sight
and
which
makes
me
thirst
with
sweet
desire
may
be
fulfilled
the
better
let
thy
voice
secure
bold
and
glad
utter
the
wish
utter
the
desire
to
which
my
answer
is
already
decreed
in
the
mind
of
god
in
which
there
is
no
change
i
turned
me
to
beatrice
and
she
heard
before
i
spoke
and
smiled
to
me
a
sign
which
made
the
wings
to
my
desire
grow
and
i
began
thus
when
the
first
equality
appeared
to
you
the
affection
and
the
intelligence
became
of
one
weight
for
each
of
you
because
the
sun
which
illumined
and
warmed
you
is
of
such
equality
in
its
heat
and
in
its
light
that
all
similitudes
are
defective
but
will
and
discourse
in
mortals
for
the
reason
which
is
manifest
to
you
are
diversely
feathered
in
their
wings
wherefore
i
who
am
mortal
feel
myself
in
this
inequality
and
therefore
i
give
not
thanks
save
with
my
heart
for
thy
paternal
welcome
truly
i
beseech
thee
living
topaz
that
dost
ingem
this
precious
jewel
that
thou
make
me
content
with
thy
name
o
leaf
of
mine
in
whom
while
only
awaiting
i
took
pleasure
i
was
thy
root
such
a
beginning
he
answering
made
to
me
then
he
said
to
me

years
and
more

not
told
in
any
of
the
printed
versions
of
the
romance
of
lancelot
but
it
has
been
found
by
paget
toynbee
in
several
of
the
manuscripts
rejoices
that
it
has
capacity
to
endure
such
great
joy
florence
whose
patron
saint
was
john
the
baptist
as
a
coal
quickens
to
flame
at
the
blowing
of
the
winds
so
i
saw
that
light
become
resplendent
at
my
blandishments
and
as
it
became
more
beautiful
to
my
eyes
so
with
voice
more
dulcet
and
soft
but
not
with
this
modern
speech
it
said
to
me
from
that
clay
on
which
ave
was
said
unto
the
birth
in
which
my
mother
who
now
is
sainted
was
lightened
of
me
with
whom
she
was
burdened
this
fire
had
come
to
its
lion
five
hundred
fifty
and
thirty
times
to
reinflame
itself
beneath
his
paw
my
ancestors
and
i
were
born
in
the
place
where
the
last
ward
is
first
found
by
him
who
runs
in
your
annual
game
let
it
suffice
to
hear
this
of
my
elders
who
they
were
and
whence
they
came
thither
it
is
more
becoming
to
leave
untold
than
to
recount
mars
as
he
glow
like
a
ruddy
shield
on
the
lion
maud
part
iii
the
lion
is
the
sign
leo
in
the
zodiac
appropriate
to
mars
by
supposed
conformity
of
disposition
five
hundred
and
eighty
revolutions
of
mars
are
accomplished
in
a
little
more
than
ten
hundred
and
ninety
years
the
place
designated
was
the
boundary
of
the
division
of
the
city
called
that
of
the
gate
of
peter
where
the
corso
passes
by
the
mercato
vecchio
or
old
market
the
races
were
run
along
the
corso
on
the
june
the
festival
of
john
the
baptist
all
those
able
to
bear
arms
who
at
that
time
were
there
between
mars
and
the
baptist
were
the
fifth
of
them
who
are
living
but
the
citizenship
which
is
now
mixed
with
campi
and
with
certaldo
and
with
figghine
was
to
be
seen
pure
in
the
lowest
artisan
oh
how
much
better
it
would
be
that
those
folk
of
whom
i
speak
were
neighbors
and
to
have
your
confine
at
galluzzo
and
at
trespiano
than
to
have
them
within
and
to
endure
the
stench
of
the
churl
of
aguglione
and
of
him
of
signa
who
already
has
his
eye
sharp
for
barratry
between
the
ponte
vecchio
at
the
head
of
which
stood
the
statue
of
mars
and
the
baptistery
two
points
marking
the
circuit
of
the
ancient
walls
small
towns
not
far
from
florence
from
which
as
from
many
others
there
had
been
emigration
to
the
thriving
city
to
the
harm
of
its
own
people
it
would
have
been
better
to
keep
these
people
at
a
distance
as
neighbors
and
to
have
narrow
bounds
for
the
territory
of
the
city
the
churl
of
aguglione
was
according
to
benvenuto
da
imola
a
lawyer
named
baldo
qui
fuit
magnus
canis
he
became
one
of
the
priors
of
florence
in
he
of
signa
is
supposed
to
have
been
one
bonifazio
who
says
buti
sold
his
favors
and
offices
if
the
people
which
most
degenerates
in
the
world
had
not
been
as
a
stepdame
unto
caesar
but
like
a
mother
benignant
to
her
son
there
is
one
now
a
florentine
who
changes
money
and
traffics
who
would
have
returned
to
simifonti
there
where
his
grandsire
used
to
go
begging
montemurlo
would
still
belong
to
its
counts
the
cerchi
would
be
in
the
parish
of
acone
and
perhaps
the
buondelmonti
in
valdigreve
the
confusion
of
persons
has
always
been
the
beginning
of
the
harm
of
the
city
as
in
the
body
the
food
which
is
added
and
a
blind
bull
falls
more
headlong
than
the
blind
lamb
and
oftentimes
one
sword
cuts
more
and
better
than
five
if
thou
regardest
luni
and
urbisaglia
how
they
have
gone
and
how
chiusi
and
sinigaglia
are
going
their
way
after
them
to
hear
how
families
are
undone
will
not
appear
to
thee
a
strange
thing
or
a
bard
since
cities
have
their
term
your
things
all
have
their
death
even
as
ye
but
it
is
concealed
in
some
that
last
long
while
lives
are
short
and
as
the
revolution
of
the
heaven
of
the
moon
covers
and
uncovers
the
shores
without
a
pause
so
fortune
does
with
florence
wherefore
what
i
shall
tell
of
the
high
florentines
whose
fame
is
hidden
by
time
should
not
appear
to
thee
a
marvellous
thing
i
saw
the
ughi
and
i
saw
the
catellini
filippi
greci
ormanni
and
alberichi
even
in
their
decline
illustrious
citizens
and
i
saw
as
great
as
they
were
old
with
those
of
the
sannella
those
of
the
area
and
soldanieri
and
ardinghi
and
bostiebi
over
the
gate
which
at
present
is
laden
with
new
felony
of
such
weight
that
soon
there
will
be
jettison
from
the
bark
were
the
ravignani
from
whom
the
count
guido
is
descended
and
whosoever
since
has
taken
the
name
of
the
high
bellincione
he
of
the
pressa
knew
already
bow
one
needs
to
rule
and
galigaio
already
had
in
his
house
the
gilded
hilt
and
pummel
great
were
already
the
column
of
the
vair
the
sacchetti
giuochi
fifanti
and
barucci
and
galli
and
they
who
blush
for
the
bushel
the
stock
from
which
the
calfucci
sprang
was
already
great
and
already
the
sizii
and
arrigucci
had
been
drawn
to
curule
chairs
oh
how
great
did
i
see
those
who
have
been
undone
by
their
pride
and
the
balls
of
gold
made
florence
flourish
with
all
their
great
deeds
so
did
the
fathers
of
those
who
always
when
your
church
is
vacant
become
fat
staying
in
consistory
the
overweening
race
which
is
as
a
dragon
behind
him
who
flies
and
to
him
who
shows
tooth
or
purse
is
gentle
as
a
lamb
already
was
coming
up
but
from
small
folk
so
that
it
pleased
not
ubertin
donato
that
his
should
afterwards
make
him
their
relation
already
had
caponsacco
descended
into
the
market
place
down
from
fiesole
and
already
was
giuda
a
good
citizen
and
infangato
i
will
tell
a
thing
incredible
and
true
into
the
little
circle
one
entered
by
a
gate
which
was
named
for
those
of
the
pear
every
one
who
bears
the
beautiful
ensign
of
the
great
baron
whose
name
and
whose
praise
the
feast
of
thomas
revives
from
him
had
knighthood
and
privilege
although
he
who
binds
it
with
a
border
unites
himself
with
the
populace
already
there
were
gualterotti
and
importuni
and
borgo
would
now
be
more
quiet
if
they
had
gone
hung
for
new
neighbors
the
house
of
which
was
born
your
weeping
through
its
just
indignation
which
has
slain
you
and
put
an
end
to
your
glad
living
was
honored
both
itself
and
its
consorts
o
buondelmonte
how
ill
didst
thou
flee
its
nuptials
through
the
persuasions
of
another
many
would
be
glad
who
now
are
sorrowful
if
god
had
conceded
thee
to
the
ema
the
first
time
that
thou
camest
to
the
city
but
it
behoved
that
florence
in
her
last
peace
should
offer
a
victim
to
that
broken
stone
which
guards
the
bridge
if
the
clergy
had
not
quarrelled
with
the
emperor
bringing
about
factions
and
disturbances
in
the

i
have
not
discovered

this
is

they

been

by

florentine
commune
to
give
up

and
to
take
up
their

in
the

where
they
became
powerful

by

the
downward
current
thence
even
as
sweet
harmony
comes
to
the
ear
from
an
organ
comes
to
my
sight
the
time
that
is
preparing
for
thee
as
hippolytus
departed
from
athens
by
reason
of
his
pitiless
and
perfidious
stepmother
so
out
from
florence
thou
must
needs
depart
this
is
willed
this
is
already
sought
for
and
soon
it
shall
be
brought
to
pass
by
him
i
who
designs
it
there
where
every
day
christ
is
bought
and
sold
the
blame
will
follow
the
injured
party
in
outcry
as
it
is
wont
but
the
vengeance
will
be
testimony
to
the
truth
which
dispenses
it
thou
shalt
leave
everything
beloved
most
dearly
and
this
is
the
arrow
which
the
bow
of
exile
first
shoots
thou
shalt
prove
how
the
bread
of
others
savors
of
salt
and
how
the
descending
and
the
mounting
of
another
stairs
is
a
hard
path
and
that
which
will
heaviest
weigh
upon
thy
shoulders
will
be
the
evil
and
foolish
company
with
which
into
this
valley
thou
shalt
fall
which
all
ungrateful
all
senseless
and
impious
will
turn
against
thee
but
short
while
after
it
not
thou
shall
have
the
forehead
red
therefor
of
its
bestiality
its
own
procedure
will
give
the
proof
so
that
it
will
be
seemly
for
thee
to
have
made
thyself
a
party
by
thyself
not
with
riddles
such
as
the
oracles
gave
out
before
they
fell
silent
at
the
coming
of
christ
boniface
viii
the
other
florentine
exiles
of
the
party
of
the
whites
thy
first
refuge
and
first
inn
shall
be
the
courtesy
of
the
great
lombard
who
upon
the
ladder
bears
the
holy
bird
who
will
turn
such
benign

by
its
silence
that
holy
soul
showed
it
had
finished
putting
the
woof
into
that
web
which
i
had
given
it
warped
i
began
as
he
who
in
doubt
longs
for
counsel
from
a
person
who
sees
and
uprightly
wills
and
loves
i
see
well
my

how
the
time
spurs
on
toward
me
to
give
me
such
a
blow
as
is
heaviest
to
him
who
most
deserts
himself
wherefore
it
is
good
that
i
arm
me
with
foresight
so
that
if
the
place
most
dear
be
taken
from
me
i
should
not
lose
the
others
by
my
songs
down
through
the
world
of
endless
bitterness
and
over
the
mountain
from
whose
fair
summit
the
eyes
of
my
lady
have
lifted
me
and
afterward
through
the
heavens
from
light
to
light
i
have
learned
that
which
if
i
repeat
it
shall
be
to
many
a
savor
keenly
sour
and
if
i
am
a
timid
friend
to
the
truth
i
fear
to
lose
life
among
those
who
will
call
this
time
the
olden
the
light
in
which
my
treasure
which
i
had
found
there
was
smiling
first
became
flashing
as
a
mirror
of
gold
in
the
sunbeam
then
it
replied
a
conscience
dark
either
with
its
own
or
with
another
shame
will
indeed
feel
thy
speech
as
harsh
but
nevertheless
all
falsehood
laid
aside
make
thy
whole
vision
manifest
and
let
the
scratching
be
even
where
the
itch
is
for
if
at
the
first
taste
thy
voice
shall
be
molestful
afterwards
when
it
shall
be
digested
it
will
leave
vital
nourishment
this
cry
of
thine
shall
do
as
the
wind
which
heaviest
strikes
the
loftiest
summits
and
that
will
be
no
little
argument
of
honor
therefore
to
thee
have
been
shown
within
these
wheels
upon
the
mountain
and
in
the
woeful
valley
only
the
souls
which
are
known
of
fame
for
the
mind
of
him
who
bears
rests
not
nor
confirms
its
faith
through
an
example

root
unknown
and
hidden

to
the

of

shaped
in
light
upon
the
planet
by
the
denunciation
of
the
avarice
of
the
popes
now
was
that
blessed
mirror
enjoying
alone
its
own
word
and
i
was
tasting
mine
tempering
the
bitter
with
the
sweet
and
that
lady
who
to
god
was
leading
me
said
change
thy
thought
think
that
i
am
near
to
him
who
lifts
the
burden
of
every
wrong
i
turned
me
round
at
the
loving
sound
of
my
comfort
and
what
love
i
then
saw
in
the
holy
eyes
i
here
leave
it
not
only
because
i
distrust
my
own
speech
but
because
of
the
memory
which
can
not
return
so
far
above
itself
unless
another
guide
it
thus
much
of
that
moment
can
i
recount
that
again
beholding
her
my
affection
was
free
from
every
other
desire
its
own
thoughts
in
contemplation
while
the
eternal
pleasure
which
was
raying
directly
upon
beatrice
from
her
fair
face
was
contenting
me
with
its
second
aspect
vanquishing
me
with
the
light
of
a
smile
she
said
to
me
turn
thee
and
listen
for
not
only
in
my
eyes
is
paradise
its
aspect
reflected
from
the
eyes
of
beatrice
as
sometimes
here
one
sees
the
affection
in
the
countenance
if
it
be
so
great
that
by
it
the
whole
soul
is
occupied
so
in
the
flaming
of
the
holy
effulgence
to
which
i
turned
me
i
recognized
the
will
in
it
still
to
speak
somewhat
with
me
it
began
in
this
fifth
threshold
of
the
tree
which
lives
from
its
top
and
always
bears
fruit
and
never
loses
leaf
are
blessed
spirits
who
below
before
they
came
to
heaven
were
of
great
renown
so
that
every
muse
would
be
rich
with
them
therefore
gaze
upon
the
arms
of
the
cross
he
whom
i
shall
name
will
there
do
that
which
within
a
cloud
its
own
swift
fire
does
at
the
naming
of
joshua
even
as
he
did
it
i
saw
a
light
drawn
over
the
cross
nor
was
the
word
noted
by
me
before
the
act
and
at
the
name
of
the
lofty
maccabeus
i
saw
another
move
revolving
and
gladness
was
the
whip
of
the
top
thus
for
charlemagne
and
for
roland
my
attentive
gaze
followed
two
of
them
as
the
eye
follows
its
falcon
as
be
flies
afterward
william
and
renouard
and
the

godfrey
and

drew
my
sight
over
that
cross
then
moving
and
mingling
among
the
other
lights
the
soul
which
had
spoken
with
me
showed
me
how
great
an
artist
it
was
among

turned
me
round
to
my
right
side
to
see
my
duty
signified
in
beatrice
either
by
speech
or
by
act
and
i
saw
her
eyes
so
clear
so
joyous
that
her
semblance
surpassed
her
other
and
her
latest
wont
and
even
as
through
feeling
more
delight
in
doing
good
a
man
from
day
to
day
becomes
aware
that
his
virtue
is
advancing
so
i
became
aware
that
my
circling
round
together
with
the
heaven
had
increased
its
are
seeing
that
miracle
more
adorned
and
such
as
is
the
change
in
brief
passage
of
time
in
a
pale
lady
when
her
countenance
is
unlading
the
load
of
bashfulness
such
was
there
in
my
eyes
when
i
had
turned
because
of
the
whiteness
of
the
temperate
sixth
star
which
had
received
me
within
itself
i
saw
within
that
torch
of
jove
the
sparkling
of
the
love
which
was
there
shape
out
our
speech
to
my
eyes
and
as
birds
risen
from
the
as
if
rejoicing
together
over
their
food
make
of
themselves
a
troop
now
round
now
of
some
other
shape
so
within
the
lights
holy
creatures
were
singing
as
they
flew
and
made
of
themselves
now
d
now
i
now
l
in
their
proper
shapes
first
singing
they
moved
to
their
melody
then
becoming
one
of
these
characters
they
stopped
a
little
and
were
silent
the
change
is
from
the
red
light
of
mars
to
the
white
light
of
jupiter
a
planet
called
by
astrologers
the
temperate
star
as
lying
between
the
heat
of
mars
and
the
coldness
of
saturn
the
sparkles
of
the
love
which
was
there
the

o

makest
the

of
men

and

them
as
they
through
thee
the
cities
and
the
kingdoms
illume
me
with
thyself
that
i
may
set
in
relief
their
shapes
as
i
have
conceived
them
i
let
thy
power
appear
in
these
brief
verses
an
appellation
appropriate
to
any
one
of
the
muses
whose
fountain
hippocrene
sprang
at
the
stamp
of
pegasus
here
probably
applied
to
urania
already
once
invoked
by
the
poet

they
showed
themselves
then
in
five
times
seven
vowels
and
consonants
and
i
noted
the
parts
as
they
seemed
spoken
to
me
diligite
justitiam
were
first

and
noun
of
all
the

qui

the
last
then
in
the
m
of
the
fifth
word
they
remained
arranged
so
that
jove
seemed
silver
patterned
there
with
gold
and
i
saw
other
lights
descending
where
the
top
of
the
m
was
and
become
quiet
there
singing
i
believe
the
good
which
moves
them
to
itself
then
as
on
the
striking
of
burnt
logs
rise
innumerable
sparks
wherefrom
the
foolish

to
draw
auguries
there
seemed
to
rise
again
thence
more
than
a
thousand
lights
and
mount
one
much
and
one
little
according
as
the
sun
which
kindles
them
allotted
them
and
each
having
become
quiet
in
its
place
i
saw
the
head
and
the
neck
of
an
eagle
represented
by
that
patterned
fire
he
who
paints
there
has
none
who
may
guide
him
but
himself
guides
and
by
him
is
inspired
that
virtue
which
is

for
the
nests

rest
of
the
blessed

at
first
seemed

be
enlilied

the
words
are

they
may
mean
that
a
virtue
or
instinct
similar
to
that
which
teaches
the
bird
to
build
its
nest
directed
the
shaping
of
these
letters
ingigliare
a
word
invented
by
dante
and
used
only
by
him
the
meaning
is
that
these
spirits
seemed
first
to
form
a
lily
on
the
o
sweet
star
how
great
gems
and
how
many
showed
to
me
that
our
justice
is
the
effect
of
that
heaven
which
thou
ingemmest
wherefore
i
pray
the
mind
in
which
thy
motion
and
thy
virtue
have
their
source
that
it
regard
whence
issues
the
smoke
which
spoils
thy
radiance
so
that
now
a
second
time
it
may
be
wroth
at
the
buying
and
selling
within
the
temple
which
was
walled
with
signs
and
martyrdoms
o
soldiery
of
the
heaven
on

i
gaze

ye

those
who
are
on

gone
astray

the
bad

was
the
wont
to
make
war
with

now
it
is
made
by
taking
now
here

bread
which
the
piteous
father
locks
up
from
none

it
speaks
of
the
mysteries
of

of
the
necessity

for
salvation
of
the

of
certain
kings
the
beautiful
image
which
in
its
sweet
fruition
was
making
joyful
the
interwoven
souls
appeared
before
me
with
outspread
wings
each
soul
appeared
a
little
ruby
on
which
a
ray
of
the
sun
glowed
so
enkindled
that
it
reflected
him
into
my
eyes
and
that
which
it
now
behoves
me
to
describe
no
voice
ever
reported
nor
ink
wrote
nor
was
it
ever
conceived
by
the
fancy
for
i
saw
and
also
heard
the
beak
speaking
and
uttering
with
the
voice
both
i
and
my
when
in
conception
it
was
we
and
our
an
image
of
the
concordant
will
of
the
just
and
of
the
unity
of
justice
under
the
empire
and
it
began
through
being
just
and
pious
am
i
here
exalted
to
that
glory
which
lets
not
itself
be
conquered
by
desire
and
on
earth
i
left
my
memory
such
that
the
evil
people
there
commend
it
but
continue
not
its
story
thus
a
single
heat
makes
itself
felt
from
many
embers
even
as
from
many
loves
a
single
sound
issued
from
that
image
wherefore
i
thereon
o
perpetual
flowers
of
the
eternal
gladness
which
make
all
your
odors
seem
to
me
as
only
one
deliver
me
by
your
breath
from
the
great
fast
which
has
held
me
long
in
hunger
not
finding
for
it
any
food
on
earth
well
i
know
that
if
the
divine
justice
makes
any
realm
in
heaven
its
mirror
yours
does
not
apprehend
it
through
a
veil
ye
know
how
intently
i
address
myself
to
listen
ye
know
what
is
that
doubt
which
is
so
old
a
fast
to
me
here
if
anywhere
the
divine
justice
is
reflected
concerning
the
divine
justice
as
a
falcon
which
issuing
from
his
hood
moves
his
head
and
claps
his
wings
showing
desire
and
making
himself
fine
so
i
saw
this
ensign
which
was
woven
of
praise
of
the
divine
grace
become
with
songs
such
as
he
knows
who
thereabove
rejoices
then
it
began
he
who
turned
the
compasses
at
the
verge
of
the
world
and
distributed
within
it
so
much
occult
and
manifest
could
not
so
imprint
his
power
on
all
the
universe
that
his
word
should
not
remain
in
infinite
excess
and
this
makes
certain
that
the
first
proud
one
who
was
the
top
of
every
creature
through
not
awaiting
light
fell
immature
and
hence
it
appears
that
every
lesser
nature
is
a
scant
receptacle
for
that
good
which
has
no
end
and
measures
itself
by
itself
wherefore
our
vision
which
needs
must
be
some
ray
of
the
mind
with
which
all
things
are
full
can
not
in
its
own
nature
be
so
potent
that
it
may
not
discern
its
origin
to
be
far
beyond
that
which
is
apparent
to
it
therefore
the
sight
which
your
world
receives
penetrates
into
the
eternal
justice
as
the
eye
into
the
sea
which
though
from
the
shore
it
can
see
the
bottom
on
the
ocean
sees
it
not
and
nevertheless
it
is
there
but
the
depth
conceals
it
there
is
no
light
but
that
which
comes
from
the
serene
which
is
never
clouded
nay
there
is
darkness
either
shadow
of
the
flesh
or
its
poison
the
hiding
place
is
now
open
enough
to
thee
which
concealed
from
thee
the
living
justice
concerning
which
thou
madest
such
frequent
question
for
thou
saidest
man
is
born
on
the
bank
of
the
indus
and
no
one
is
there
who
may
speak
of
christ
nor
who
may
read
nor
who
may
write
and
all
his
wishes
and
acts
are
good
so
far
as
human
reason
sees
without
sin
in
life
or
in
speech
he
dies
unbaptized
and
without
faith
where
is
this
justice
which
condemns
him
where
is
his
sin
if
he
does
not
believe
now
who
art
thou
that
wouldst
sit
upon
a
bench
to
judge
a
thousand
miles
away
with
the
short
vision
of
a
single
span
assuredly
for
him
who
subtilizes
with
me
if
the
scripture
were
not
above
you
there
would
be
occasion
for
doubting
to
a
marvel
oh
earthly
animals
oh
gross
minds
the
word
that
is
the
thought
or
wisdom
of
god
infinitely
exceeds
the
expression
of
it
in

lucifer

through
pride
fancying
himself
though

equal
to

creator

he
awaited

color
of
gold
through
which
a
sunbeam
is
shining
a
stairway
rising
up
so
high
that
my
eye
followed
it
not
i
saw
moreover
so
many
splendors
descending
along
the
steps
that
i
thought
every
light
which
appears
in
heaven
was
there
diffused
saturn
in
the
golden
age
as
in
a
painted
window
and
as
according
to
their
natural
custom
the
rooks
at
the
beginning
of
the
day
move
about
together
in
order
to
warm
their
cold
feathers
then
some
go
away
without
return
others
wheel
round
to
whence
they
had
set
forth
and
others
circling
make
a
stay
such
fashion
it
seemed
to
me
was
here
in
that
sparkling
which
came
together
so
soon
as
it
struck
on
a
certain
step
and
that
which
stopped
nearest
to
us
became
so
bright
that
i
said
in
my
thought
i
clearly
see
the
love
which
thou
signifiest
to
me
but
she
from
whom
i
await
the
how
and
the
when
of
speech
and
of
silence
stays
still
wherefore
i
contrary
to
desire
do
well
that
i
ask
not
whereupon
she
who
saw
my
silence
in
the
sight
of
him
who
sees
everything
said
to
me
let
loose
thy
warm
desire
and
i
began
my
own
merit
makes
me
not
worthy
of
thy
answer
but
for
her
sake
who
concedes
to
me
the
asking
o
blessed
life
that
keepest
thyself
hidden
within
thine
own
joy
make
known
to
me
the
cause
which
has
placed
thee
so
near
me
and
tell
why
in
this
wheel
the
sweet
symphony
of
paradise
is
silent
which
below
through
the
others
so
devoutly
sounds
thou
hast
thy
hearing
mortal
as
thy
sight
it
replied
to
me
therefore
no
song
is
here
for
the
same
reason
that
beatrice
has
no
smile
down
along
the
steps
of
the
holy
stairway
i
have
thus
far
descended
only
to
give
thee
glad
welcome
with
my
speech
and
with
the
light
that
mantles
me
nor
has
more
love
made
me
to
be
more
ready
for
as
much
and
more
love
is
burning
here
above
even
as
the
flaming
manifests
to
thee
but
the
high
charity
which
makes
us
ready
servants
to
the
counsel
that
governs
the
world
allots
here
even
as
thou
observest
i
see
well
said
i
o
sacred
lamp
how
the
free
will
of
love
suffices
in
this
court
for
following
the
eternal
providence
but
this
is
what
seems
to
me
hard
to
discern
why
thou
alone
wert
predestined
to
this
office
among
thy
consorts
i
had
not
come
to
the
last
word
before
the
light
made
a
centre
of
its
middle
whirling
like
a
swift
milestone
then
the
love
that
was
within
it
answered
a
divine
light
strikes
upon
me
penetrating
through
this
wherein
i
embosom
me
the
virtue
of
which
conjoined
with
my
vision
lifts
me
above
myself
so
far
that
i
see
the
supreme
essence
from
which
it
emanates
thence
comes
the
joy
wherewith
i
flame
because
to
my
vision
in
proportion
as
it
is
clear
i
match
the
clearness
of
my
flame
but
that
soul
in
heaven
which
is
most
enlightened
that
seraph
who
has
his
eye
most
fixed
on
god
could
not
satisfy
thy
demand
because
that
which
thou
askest
lies
so
deep
within
the
abyss
of
the
eternal
statute
that
from
every
created
sight
it
is
cut
off
and
when
thou
retumest
to
the
mortal
world
carry
this
back
so
that
it
may
no
more
presume
to
move
its
feet
toward
such
a
goal
the
mind
which
shines
here
on
earth
is
smoky
wherefore
consider
how
there
below
it
can
do
that
which
it
can
not
do
though
heaven
assume
it
assigns
its
part
to
each
spirit
with
the
divine
light
so
did
its
words
prescribe
to
me
that
i
left
the
question
and
drew
me
back
to
ask
it
humbly
who
it
was
between
the
two
shores
of
italy
and
not
very
distant
from
thy
native
land
rise
rocks
so
lofty
that
the
thunders
sound
far
lower
down
and
they
make
a
height
which
is
called
catria
beneath
which
a
hermitage
is
consecrated
which
is
wont
to
be
devoted
to
worship
only
thus
it
began
again
to
me
with
its
third
speech
and
then
continuing
it
said
here
in
the
service
of
god
i
became
so
steadfast
that
with
food
of
olive
juice
alone
lightly
i
used
to
pass
the
heats
and
frosts
content
in
contemplative
thoughts
that
cloister
was
wont
to
render
in
abundance
to
these
heavens
and
now
it
is
become
so
empty
as
needs
must
soon
be
revealed
in
that
place
i
was
peter
damian
and
peter
a
sinner
had
i
been
in
the
house
of
our
lady
on
the
adriatic
shore
little
of
mortal
life
was
remaining
for
me
when
i
was
sought
for
and
dragged
to
that
hat
which
ever
is
passed
down
from
bad
to
worse
cephas
came
and
the
great
vessel
of
the
holy
spirit
came
lean
and
barefoot
taking
the
food
of
whatsoever
inn
now
the
modern
pastors
require
one
to
hold
them
up
on
this
side
and
that
and
one
to
lead
them
so
heavy
are
they
and
one
to
support
them
behind
they
cover
their
palfreys
with
their
mantles
so
that
two
beasts
go
under
one
skin
o
patience
that
endurest
so
much
at
this
voice
i
saw
more
flamelets
from
step
to
step
descending
and
revolving
and
each
revolution
made
them
more
beautiful
round
about
this
one
they
came
and
stopped
and
uttered
a
cry
of
such
deep
sound
that
here
could
be
none
like
it
nor
did
i
understand
it
the
thunder
so
overcame
me
catria
is
a
high
offshoot
to
the
east
from
the
chain
of
the
apennines
between
urbino
and
gubbio
far
up
on
its
side
lies
the
monastery
of
santa
croce
di
fouts
avellana
belonging
to
the
order
of
the
camaldulensians
a
famous
doctor
of
the
church
in

eleventh
century
he
was
for
many
years
abbot
of
the
monastery
of

avellana
these
last
words
are
obscure
and
have
given
occasion
to
much
discussion
after
which
they
remain
no
clearer
than
before
the
house
of
our
lady
on
the
adriatic
shore
is
supposed
to
be
the
monastery
of

beatrice

ascend
to

the
constellation
of
the
sight
of
the

oppressed
with
amazement
i
turned
me
to
my
guide
like
a
little
child
who
runs
back
always
thither
where
he
most
confides
and
she
like
a
mother
who
quickly
succors
her
pale
and
breathless
son
with
her
voice
which
is
wont
to
reassure
him
said
to
me
knowest
thou
not
that
thou
art
in
heaven
and
knowest
thou
not
that
heaven
is
all
holy
and
whatever
is
done
here
comes
from
good
zeal
how
the
song
would
have
transformed
thee
and
i
by
smiling
thou
canst
now
conceive
since
the
cry
has
moved
thee
so
much
in
which
if
thou
hadst
understood
its
prayers
already
would
be
known
to
thee
the
vengeance
which
thou
shalt
see
before
thou
diest
the
sword
of
here
on
high
cuts
not
in
haste
nor
slow
save
to
the
seeming
of
him
who
desiring
or
fearing
awaits
it
but
turn
thee
round
now
toward
the
others
for
many
illustrious
spirits
thou
shalt
see
if
as
i
say
thou
dost
lead
back
thy
look
as
it
pleased
her
i
directed
my
eyes
and
saw
a
hundred
little
spheres
which
together
were
becoming
more
beautiful
with
mutual
rays
i
was
standing
as
one
who
within
himself
represses
the
point
of
his
desire
and
attempts
not
to
ask
he
so
fears
the
and
the
largest
and
the
most
luculent
of
those
pearls
came
forward
to
make
of
its
own
accord
my
wish
content
then
within
it
i
heard
if
thou
couldst
see
as
i
do
the
charity
which
burns
among
us
thy
thoughts
would
be
expressed
but
that
thou
through
waiting
mayst
not
delay
thy
high
end
i
will
make
answer
to
thee
even
to
the
thought
concerning
which
thou
art
so
regardful
that
mountain
on
whose
slope
cassino
is
was
of
old
frequented
on
its
summit
by
the
deluded
and
illdisposed
people
and
i
am
be
who
first
carried
up
thither
the
name
of
him
who
brought
to
earth
the
truth
which
so
high
exalts
us
and
such
grace
shone
upon
me
that
i
drew
away
the
surrounding
villages
from
the
impious
worship
which
seduced
the
world
these
other
fires
were
all
contemplative
men
kindled
by
that
heat
which
brings
to
birth
holy
flowers
and
fruits
here
is
macarius
here
is
romuald
here
are
my
brothers
who
within
the
cloisters
fixed
their
feet
and
held
a
steadfast
heart
and
i
to
him
the
affection
which
thou
displayest
in
speaking
with
me
and
the
good
semblance
which
i
see
and
note
in
all
your
ardors
have
so
expanded
my
confidence
as
the
sun
does
the
rose
when
she
becomes
open
so
much
as
she
has
power
to
be
therefore
i
pray
thee
and
do
thou
father
assure
me
if
i
have
power
to
receive
so
much
grace
that
i
may
see
thee
with
uncovered
shape
whereon
he
brother
thy
high
desire
shall
be
fulfilled
in
the
last
sphere
where
are
fulfilled
all
others
and
my
own
there
perfect
mature
and
whole
is
every
desire
in
that
alone
is
every
part
there
where
it
always
was
for
it
is
not
in
space
and
hath
not
poles
and
our
stairway
reaches
up
to
it
wherefore
thus
from
thy
sight
it
conceals
itself
far
up
as
there
the
patriarch
jacob
saw
it
stretch
its
topmost
part
when
it
appeared
to
him
so
laden
with
angels
but
now
no
one
lifts
his
feet
from
earth
to
ascend
it
and
my
rule
is
remaining
as
waste
of
paper
the
walls
which
used
to
be
an
abbey
have
become
caves
and
the
cowls
are
sacks
full
of
bad
meal
but
heavy
usury
is
not
gathered
in
so
greatly
against
the
pleasure
of
god
as
that
fruit
which
makes
the
heart
of
monks
so
foolish
for
whatsoever
the
church
guards
is
all
for
the
folk
that
ask
it
in
god
name
not
for
one
kindred
or
for
another
more
vile
the
flesh
of
mortals
is
so
soft
that
a
good
beginning
suffices
not
below
from
the
springing
of
the
oak
to
the
forming
of
the
acorn
peter
began
without
gold
and
without
silver
and
i
with
prayers
and
with
fasting
and
francis
in
humility
his
convent
and
if
thou
lookest
at
the
source
of
each
and
then
lookest
again
whither
it
has
run
thou
wilt
see
dark
made
of
the
white
truly
jordan
turned
back
and
the
sea
fleeing
when
god
willed
were
more
marvellous
to
behold
than
succor
here
monte
cassino
in
the
kingdom
of
naples
on
which
a
temple
of
apollo
had
stood
was
chosen
by
benedict
as
his
abode
and
became
the
site
of
the
most
famous
monastery
of
his
order
the
egyptian
anchorite
of
the
fourth
century
the
founder
of
the
order
of
camaldoli
he
died
in
were
god
now
to
interpose
to
correct
the
evils
of
the
church
the
marvel
would
be
less
than
that
of
the
miracles
of
old
and
therefore
his
interposition
may
be
hoped
for
thus
he
said
to
me
and
then
drew
back
to
his
company
and
the
company
closed
up
then
like
a
whirlwind
all
gathered
itself
upward
the
sweet
lady
urged
me
behind
them
with
only
a
sign
up
over
that
stairway
so
did
her
virtue
overcome
my
nature
but
never
here
below
where
one
mounts
and
descends
naturally
was
there
motion
so
rapid
that
it
could
be
compared
unto
my
wing
so
may
i
return
reader
to
that
devout
triumph
for
the
sake
of
which
i
often
bewail
my
sins
and
beat
my
breast
thou
hadst
not
so
quickly
drawn
out
and
put
thy
finger
in
the
fire
as
i
saw
the
sign
which
follows
the
bull
and
was
within
it
the
sign
of
the
gemini
or
twins
in
the
heaven
of
the
fixed
stars
o
glorious
stars
o
light
impregnate
with
great
virtue
from
which
i
acknowledge
all
my
genius
whatever
it
may
be
with
you
was
born
and
with
you
was
hiding
himself
he
who
is
father
of
every
mortal
life
when
i
first
felt
the
tuscan
air
and
then
when
the
grace
was
bestowed
on
me
of
entrance
within
the
lofty
wheel
which
turns
you
your
region
was
allotted
to
me
to
you
my
soul
now
devoutly
sighs
to
acquire
virtue
for
the
difficult
pass
which
draws
her
to
itself
at
the
time
of
dante
birth
the
sun
was
in
the
sign
of
the
twins
thou
art
so
near
the
ultimate
salvation
began
beatrice
that
thou
oughtest
to
have
thine
eyes
clear
and
sharp
and
therefore
ere
thou
further
enterest
it
look
back
downward
and
see
how
great
a
world
i
have
already
set
beneath
thy
feet
in
order
that
thy
heart
so
far
as
it
is
able
may
present
itself
joyous
to
the
triumphant
crowd
which
comes
glad
through
this
round
aether
with
my
sight
i
returned
through
each
and
all
the
seven
spheres
and
saw
this
globe
such
that
i
smiled
at
its
mean
semblance
and
that
counsel
i
approve
as
best
which
holds
it
of
least
account
and
he
who
thinks
of
other
things
may
be
called
truly
worthy
i
saw
the
daughter
of
latona
enkindled
without
that
shadow
which
had
been
the
cause
why
i
once
believed
her
rare
and
dense
the
aspect
of
thy
son
hyperion
here
i
endured
and
i
saw
how
maia
and
dione
move
around
and
near
him
then
appeared
to
me
the
temperateness
of
jove
between
his
father
and
his
son
and
then
was
clear
to
me
the
variation
which
they
make
in
their
places
and
all
the
seven
were
displayed
to
me
how
great
they
are
and
how
swift
they
are
and
how
they
are
in
distant
houses
while
i
was
revolving
with
the
eternal
twins
the
little
which
makes
us
so
fierce
all
appeared
to
me
from
its
hills
to
its
harbors
the
mothers
of
venus
and
mercury
by
whose
names
these
planets
are
designated
saturn
and
mars
the
inhabited
earth
then
i
turned
back
my
eyes
to
the
beautiful
eyes
canto

the
triumph
of
christ
as
the
bird
among
the
beloved
leaves
reposing
on
the
nest
of
her
sweet
brood
through
the
night
which
hides
things
from
us
who
in
order
to
see
their
looks
and
to
find
the
food
wherewith
she
may
feed
them
in
which
heavy
toils
are
pleasing
to
her
anticipates
the
time
upon
the
open
twig
and
with
ardent
affection
awaits
the
sun
fixedly
looking
till
the
dawn
may
break
thus
my
lady
was
standing
erect
and
attentive
turned
toward
the
region
beneath
which
the
sun
shows
least
haste
so
that
i
seeing
her
rapt
and
eager
became
such
as
he
who
in
desire
should
wish
for
something
and
in
hope
is
satisfied
but
short
while
was
there
between
one
and
the
other
when
that
of
my
awaiting
i
mean
and
of
my
seeing
the
heavens
become
brighter
and
brighter
and
beatrice
said
behold
the
hosts
of
the
triumph
of
christ
and
all
the
fruit
harvested
by
the
revolution
of
these
spheres
it
seemed
to
me
her
face
was
all
aflame
and
her
eyes
were
so
full
of
joy
that
i
must
needs
pass
it
over
without
description
the
meridian
by
the
beneficent
influences
of
the
planets
as
in
the
clear
skies
at
the
full
moon
trivia
smiles
among
the
eternal
nymphs
who
paint
the
heaven
through
all
its
depths
i
saw
above
myriads
of
lights
a
sun
that
was
enkindling
each
and
all
of
them
as
ours
kindles
the
supernal
shows
and
through
its
living
light
the
lucent
substance
shone
so
bright
upon
my
face
that
i
sustained
it
not
an
appellation
of
diana
and
hence
of
the
moon
according
to
the
belief
referred
to
at
the
opening
of
the
twentieth
canto
that
the
sun
was
the
source
of
the
light
of
the
stars
christ
in
his
glorified
body
o
beatrice
sweet
guide
and
dear
she
said
to
me
that
which
overcomes
thee
is
a
power
from
which
naught
defends
itself
here
is
the
wisdom
and
the
power
that
opened
the
roads
between
heaven
and
earth
for
which
there
had
already
been
such
long
desire
as
fire
from
a
cloud
unlocks
itself
by
dilating
so
that
it
is
not
contained
therein
and
against
its
own
nature
falls
down
to
earth
so
my
mind
becoming
greater
amid
those
feasts
issued
from
itself
and
what
it
became
can
not
remember
open
thine
eyes
and
look
at
what
i
am
thou
hast
seen
things
such
that
thou
art
become
able
to
sustain
my
smile
i
was
as
one
who
awakes
from
a
forgotten
dream
and
endeavors
in
vain
to
bring
it
back
again
to
memory
when
i
heard
this
invitation
worthy
of
such
gratitude
that
it
is
never
effaced
from
the
book
which
records
the
past
if
now
all
those
tongues
which
polyhymnia
and
her
sisters
made
most
fat
with
their
sweetest
milk
should
sound
to
aid
me
one
would
not
come
to
a
thousandth
of
the
truth
in
singing
the
holy
smile
and
how
it
made
the
holy
face
resplendent
and
thus
in
depicting
paradise
the
consecrated
poem
needs
must
make
a
leap
even
as
one
who
finds
his
way
cut
off
but
whoso
should
consider
the
ponderous
theme
and
the
mortal
shoulder
which
therewith
is
laden
would
not
blame
it
if
under
this
it
tremble
it
is
no
coasting
voyage
for
a
little
barque
this
which
the
intrepid
prow
goes
cleaving
nor
for
a
pilot
who
would
spare
himself
why
doth
my
face
so
enamour
thee
that
thou
turnest
not
to
the
fair
garden
which
beneath
the
rays
of
christ
is
blossoming
here
is
the
rose
in
which
the
divine
word
became
flesh
here
are
the
lilies
by
whose
odor
the
good
way
was
taken
thus
beatrice
and
i
who
to
her
counsel
was
wholly
prompt
again
betook
me
unto
the
battle
of
the
feeble
brows
the
virgin
the
apostles
and
saints
the
image
is
derived
from
paul
corinthians
ii
now
thanks
be
unto
god
which
always
causeth
us
to
triumph
in
christ
and
maketh
manifest
the
savour
of
his
knowledge
by
us
in
every
place
in
the
vulgate
the
words
are
odorem
notitiae
suae
manifestat
per
nos
as
my
eyes
covered
with
a
shadow
have
ere
now
seen
a
meadow
of
flowers
in
a
sunbeam
which
streamed
bright
through
a
rifted
cloud
so
saw
i
many
throngs
of
splendors
from
above
with
burning
rays
without
seeing
the
source
of
the
gleams
o
benignant
power
which
so
dost
impress
them
upwards
didst
thou
exalt
thyself
to
bestow
space
there
for
my
eyes
which
were
powerless
the
eyes
of
dante
powerless
to
endure
the
sight
of
the
glorified
body
of
christ
when
that
is
withdrawn
on
high
are
able
to
look
upon
those
whom
the
light
of
christ
illumines
the
name
of
the
fair
flower
which
i
ever
invoke
both
morning
and
evening
wholly
constrained
my
mind
to
gaze
upon
the
greater
fire
and
when
the
form
and
the
glory
of
the
living
star
which
up
there
surpasses
as
here
below
it
surpassed
were
depicted
in
both
my
eyes
through
the
mid
heavens
a
torch
formed
in
a
circle
in
fashion
of
a
crown
descended
and
engirt
it
and
revolved
around
it
whatever
melody
sounds
sweetest
here
below
and
to
itself
most
draws
the
soul
would
seem
a
cloud
which
rent
apart
thunders
compared
with
the
sound
of
that
lyre
wherewith
was
crowned
the
beauteous
sapphire
by
which
the
brightest
heaven
is
ensapphired
i
am
angelic
love
and
i
circle
round
the
lofty
joy
which
breathes
from
the
bosom
which
was
the
hostelry
of
our
desire
and
i
shall
circle
lady
of
heaven
while
thou
shalt
follow
thy
son
and
make
the
supreme
sphere
more
divine
because
thou
enterest
it
thus
the
circling
melody
sealed
itself
up
and
all
the
other
lights
made
resound
the
name
of
mary
the
virgin
rosa
mistica
the
brightest
of
all
the
host
that
remained
the
royal
mantle
of
all
the
volumes
of
the
world
which
is
most
fervid
and
most
quickened
in
the
breath
of
god
and
in
his
ways
had
its
inner
shore
so
distant
above
us
that
sight
of
it
there
where
i
was
did
not
yet
appear
to
me
therefore
my
eyes
had
not
the
power
to
follow
the
incoronate
flame
which
mounted
upward
following
her
own
seed
and
as
a
little
child
which
when
it
has
taken
the
milk
stretches
its
arms
toward
its
mother
through
the
spirit
that
flames
up
outwardly
each
of
these
white
splendors
stretched
upward
with
its
summit
so
that
the
deep
aflection
which
they
had
for
mary
was
manifest
to
me
then
they
remained
there
in
ray
sight
singing
regina
coeli
so
sweetly
that
never
has
the
delight
departed
from
me
oh
how
great
is
the
plenty
that
is
heaped
up
in
those
most
rich
chests
which
were
good
laborers
in
sowing
here
below
here
they
live
and
enjoy
the
treasure
that
was
acquired
while
weeping
in
the
exile
of
babylon
where
the
gold
was
left
aside
here
triumphs
under
the
high
son
of
god
and
of
mary
in
his
victory
both
with
the
ancient
and
with
the
new
council
he
who
holds
the
keys
of
such
glory
l
the
primum
mobile
the
ninth
heaven
which
revolves
around
all
the
others
the
revolving
spheres
despising
the
treasures
of
the
world
in
the
babylonish
exile
of
this
life
they
laid
up
for

peter
canto
xxiv
peter
examines
dante
concerning
faith
and
approves
his
answer
o
company
elect
to
the
great
supper
of
the
blessed
lamb
who
feeds
you
so
that
your
desire
is
always
full
since
by
grace
of
god
this
man
foretastes
of
that
which
falls
from
your
table
before
death
prescribes
the
time
for
him
give
heed
to
his
immense
longing
and
bedew
him
a
little
ye
drink
ever
of
the
fount
whence
comes
that
which
he
ponders
thus
beatrice
and
those
glad
souls
made
themselves
spheres
upon
fixed
poles
flaming
brightly
in
manner
of
comets
and
as
wheels
within
the
fittings
of
clocks
revolve
so
that
to
him
who
gives
heed
the
first
seems
quiet
and
the
last
to
fly
so
these
carols
differently
dancing
swift
and
slow
enabled
me
to
estimate
their
riches
a
carol
was
a
dance
with
song
here
used
for
the
souls
who
composed
the
carols
the
difference
in
whose
speed
gave
to
dante
the
gauge
of
their
respective
blessedness
from
that
which
i
noted
of
greatest
beauty
i
saw
issue
a
fire
so
happy
that
it
left
there
none
of
greater
brightness
and
three
times
it
revolved
round
beatrice
with
a
song
so
divine
that
my
fancy
repeats
it
not
to
me
therefore
the
pen
makes
a
leap
and
i
write
it
not
for
our
imagination
much
more
our
speech
is
of
too
vivid
color
for
such
folds
o
holy
sister
mine
who
so
devoutly
prayest
to
us
by
thy
ardent
affection
thou
unbindest
me
from
that
beautiful
sphere
after
it
had
stopped
the
blessed
fire
directed
to
my
lady
its
breath
which
spoke
thus
as
i
have
said
and
she
o
light
eternal
of
the
great
man
to
whom
our
lord
left
the
keys
which
he
bore
below
of
this
marvellous
joy
test
this
man
on
points
light
and
grave
as
pleases
thee
concerning
the
faith
through
which
thou
didst
walk
upon
the
sea
if
he
loves
rightly
and
hopes
rightly
and
believes
it
is
hidden
not
from
thee
for
thou
hast
thy
sight
there
where
everything
is
seen
depicted
but
since
this
realm
has
made
citizens
by
the
true
faith
it
is
well
that
to
glorify
it
speech
of
it
should
fall
to
him
the
figure
is
a
little
obscure
pieghe
folds
is
a
the
meaning
seems
to
be
that
as
folds
can
not
be
painted
properly
with
bright
hues
so
our
imagination
and
our
speech
are
not
delicate
enough
for
conceiving
and
depicting
such
exquisite
delights
the
meaning
seems
to
be
thou
knowest
that
he
has
true
faith
but
because
by
its
means
one
becomes
a
citizen
of
this
realm
it
is
well
that
he
should
celebrate
it
even
as
until
the
master
propounds
the
question
the
bachelor
speaks
not
and
arms
himself
in
order
to
adduce
the
proof
not
to
decide
it
so
while
she
was
speaking
i
was
arming
me
with
every
reason
in
order
to
be
ready
for
such
a
questioner
and
for
such
a
profession
say
thou
good
christian
declare
thyself
faith
what
is
it
whereon
i
raised
my
brow
to
that
light
whence
this
was
breathed
out
then
i
turned
to
beatrice
and
she
made
prompt
signals
to
me
that
i
should
pour
the
water
forth
from
my
internal
fount
may
the
grace
began
i
which
grants
to
me
that
i
confess
myself
to
the
high
captain
cause
my
conceptions
to
be
expressed
and
i
went
on
as
the
veracious
pen
father
of
thy
dear
brother
who
with
thee
set
rome
on
the
good
track
wrote
of
it
faith
is
the
substance
of
things
hoped
for
and
evidence
of
things
not
seen
and
this
appears
to
me
its
essence
then
i
heard
rightly
dost
thou
think
if
thou
understandest
well
why
he
placed
it
among
the
substances
and
then
among
the
evidences
and
i
thereon
the
deep
things
which
grant
unto
me
here
the
sight
of
themselves
are
so
hidden
to
eyes
below
that
there
their
existence
is
in
belief
alone
upon
which
the
high
hope
is
founded
and
therefore
it
takes
the
designation
of
substance
and
from
this
belief
we
needs
must
syllogize
without
having
other
sight
wherefore
it
receives
the
designation
of
evidence
then
i
heard
if
whatever
is
acquired
below
for
doctrine
were
so
understood
the
wit
of
sophist
would
have
no
place
there
thus
was
breathed
forth
from
that
enkindled
love
then
it
added
very
well
have
the
alloy
and
the
weight
of
this
coin
been
now
run
through
but
tell
me
if
thou
hast
it
in
thy
purse
and
i
yes
i
have
it
so
shining
and
so
round
that
in
its
stamp
nothing
is
uncertain
to
me
then
issued
from
the
deep
light
which
was
shining
there
this
precious
jewel
whereon
every
virtue
is
founded
whence
came
it
to
thee
and
i
the
abundant
rain
of
the
heavenly
spirit
which
is
diffused
over
the
old
and
over
the
new
parchments
is
a
syllogism
which
has
proved
it
to
me
so
acutely
that
in
comparison
with
it
every
demonstration
seems
to
me
obtuse
i
heard
then
the
old
and
the
new
proposition
which
are
so
conclusive
to
thee
why
dost
thou
hold
them
for
divine
speech
and
i
the
proofs
which
disclose
the
truth
to
me
are
the
works
that
followed
for
which
nature
never
heated
iron
nor
beat
anvil
it
was
replied
to
me
say
what
assures
thee
that
these
works
were
the
very
thing
itself
which
requires
to
be
proved
naught
else
affirms
it
to
thee
if
the
world
were
converted
to
christianity
said
i
without
miracles
this
alone
is
such
that
the
others
are
not
the
hundredth
part
for
thou
didst
enter
poor
and
fasting
into
the
field
to
sow
the
good
plant
which
once
was
a
vine
and
now
has
become
a
thornbush
may
it
enable
me
to
express
clearly
my
conceptions
hebrews
xi
the
argument
is
as
follows
the
things
of
the
spiritual
world
having
no
visible
existence
upon
earth
the
hope
of
blessedness
rests
only
on
belief
unsupported
by
material
proof
this
belief
is
faith
and
since
on
it
alone
are
the
high
hopes
founded
it
is
properly
called
their
substance
that
is
their
essential
quality
and
since
all
our
reasoning
concerning
spiritual
things
must
be
drawn
not
from
visible
things
but
from
the
convictions
of
faith
our
faith
is
also
properly
called
evidence
the
evidence
afforded
by
the
old
and
the
new
testament
that
they
are
inspired
by
the
holy
spirit
makes
their
teachings
in
regard
to
matters
of
faith
conclusive
the
two
premises
of
the
syllogism
the
miracles
this
ended
the
high
holy
court
resounded
through
the
spheres
a
we
praise
god
in
the
melody
which
thereabove
is
sung
and
that
baron
who
thus
from
branch
to
branch
examining
had
now
drawn
me
on
so
that
to
the
last
leaves
we
were
approaching
began
again
the
grace
that
dallies
with
thy
mind
has
opened
thy
mouth
up
to
this
point
as
it
should
be
opened
so
that
i
approve
that
which
has
issued
forth
but
now
there
is
need
to
express
what
thou
believest
and
wbence
it
has
been
offered
to
thy
belief
o
holy
father
spirit
who
seest
that
which
thou
so
believedst
that
thou
toward
the
sepulchre
didst
outdo
younger
feet
began
i
thou
wishest
that
i
should
declare
here
the
form
of
my
ready
belief
and
also
thou
inquirest
the
cause
of
it
and
i
answer
i
believe
in
one
god
sole
and
eternal
who
unmoved
moves
all
the
heavens
with
love
and
with
desire
and
for
such
belief
have
i
not
only
proofs
physical
and
metaphysical
but
that
truth
also
gives
it
to
me
which
hence
rains
down
through
moses
through
prophets
and
through
psalms
through
the
gospel
and
through
you
who
wrote
after
the
fiery
spirit
made
you
holy
and
i
believe
in
three
eternal
persons
and
these
i
believe
one
essence
so
one
and
so
threefold
that
it
will
admit
to
be
conjoined
with
are
and
is
of
the
profound
divine
condition
on
which
i
touch
the
evangelic
doctrine
ofttimes
sets
the
seal
upon
my
mind
this
is
the
beginning
this
is
the
spark
which
afterwards
dilates
to
vivid
flame
and
like
a
star
in
heaven
scintillates
within
me
the

encircled

then
a
light
moved
toward
us
from

sphere
whence
the
which
christ
left
of
his

had
issued
and
my
lady
full
of
gladness
said
to
me
look
look
behold

for
whose
sake
galicia
is
visited
there
below
it
was
believed
that
james
the
brother
of
john
was
buried
at
compostella
in
the
spanish
province
of
galicia
his
shrine
was
one
of
the
chief
objects
of
pilgrimage
during
the
middle
ages
even
as
when
the

alights
near

and

and
cooing
displays
its
affection
to
the
other
so
by

one
great
prince

saw
the

greeted
praising
the
food
which
feasts
them
thereabove
but
after
their
gratulation
was
completed
silent
coram
me
each
stopped
so
ignited
that
it
overcame
my

smiling
then

do
thou

up
thy

and
make
thyself
assured
for
that
which
comes
up
here
from
the
mortal
world

must
be
ripened
in
our
rays
this
comfort
from
the
second
fire
came
to
me
whereon
i
lifted
up
my
eyes
unto
the
mountains
which
bent
them
down
before
with
too
great
weight
before
me
here
as
sometimes
elsewhere
it
is
not
evident
why
dante
uses
latin
words
the
reference
is
to
the
epistle
of
james
which
dante
falling
into
a
common
error
attributes
to
james
the
greater
the
special

had
in

may
have
been
god
that
giveth
to
all
men
liberally
i
and
every
good
gift
and
every
perfect
gift
is
from
above
and
cometh
down
from
the
father
of

i
by

is
meant
the
court
or
church
of

peter
james
and
john
were
chosen
by
their
master
to
be
present
at
the
raising
of
the
daughter
of
jairus
and
to
witness
his
transfiguration
peter
personifying
faith
john
personifying
love
it
was
natural
to
take
james
as
the
personification
of
hope
since
through
grace
our
emperor
wills
that
thou
before
thy
death
come
face
to
face
with
his
counts
in
the
most
secret
hall
so
that
having
seen
the
truth
of
this
court
thou
mayest
therewith
confirm
in
thyself
and
others
the
hope
which
there
below
rightly
enamours
say
what
it
is
and
how
thy
mind
is
flowering
with
it
and
say
whence
it
came
to
thee
thus
further
did
the
second
light
proceed
and
that
compassionate
one
who
guided
the
feathers
of
my
wings
to
such
high
flight
thus
in
the
reply
anticipated
me
the
church
militant
has
not
any
son
with
more
hope
as
is
written
in
the
sun
which
irradiates
all
our
band
therefore
it
is
conceded
to
him
that
from
egypt
be
should
come
to
jerusalem
to
see
ere
the
warfare
be
at
end
for
him
the
other
two
points
which
are
asked
not
for
sake
of
knowing
but
that
he
may
report
how
greatly
this
virtue
is
pleasing
to
thee
to
him
i
leave
for
they
will
not
be
difficult
to
him
nor
of
vainglory
and
let
him
answer
to
this
and
may
the
grace
of
god
accord
this
to
him
beatrice
answers
the
question
to
which
the
reply
had
it
been
left
to
dante
might
seem
to
involve
as
a
disciple
who
follows
his
teacher
prompt
and
willing
in
that
wherein
he
is
expert
so
that
his
worth
may
be
disclosed
hope
said
i
is
a
sure
expectation
of
future
glory
which
divine
grace
produces
and

into
my

who
was
the
supreme
singer
of
the
supreme

sperent
in

know
thy
name
he
says
in
his
theody
and
who
knows
it
not
if
he
has
my
faith
thou
afterwards
didst
instil
it
into
me
with
his
instillation
in
thy
epistle
so
that
i
am

upon

psalm
ix
divine
song
while
i
was
speaking
within
the
living
bosom
of
that
burning
a
flash
was
trembling
sudden
and
intense
in
the
manner
of
lightning
then
it
breathed
the
love
wherewith
i
still
glow
toward
the
virtue
which
followed
me
far
as
the
palm
and
to
the
issue
of
the
field
wills
that
breathe
anew
to
thee
that
thou
delight
in
it
and
it
is
my
pleasure
that
thou
tell
that
which
hope
promises
to
thee
and
i
the
new
and
the
old
scriptures
set
up
the
sign
and
it
points
this
out
to
me
of
the
souls
whom
god
hath
made
his
friends
isaiah
says
that
each
shall
be
clothed
in
his
own
land
with
a
double
garment
and
his
own
land
is
this
sweet
life
and
thy
brother
far
more
explicitly
there
where
he
treats
of
the
white
robes
makes
manifest
to
us
this
revelation
therefore
in
their
land
they
shall
possess
the
double
isaiah
the
double
vesture
of
the
glorified
natural
body
and
of
the
spiritual
body

vii
and
first
close
on
the
end
of
these
words
sperent
in
te
was
heard
from
above
us
to
which
all
the
carols
made
answer
then
among
them
a
light
became
so
bright
that
if
the
crab
had
one
such
crystal
winter
would
have
a
month
of
one
sole
day
and
as
a
glad
maiden
rises
and
goes
and
enters
in
the
dance
only
to
do
honor
to
the
new
bride
and
not
for
any
fault
so
saw
i
the
brightened
splendor
come
to
the
two
who
were
turning
in
a
wheel
such
as
was
befitting
to
their
ardent
love
it
set
itself
there
into
the
song
and
into
the
measure
and
my
lady
kept
her
gaze
upon
them
even
as
a
bride
silent
and
motionless
this
is
he
who
lay
upon
the
breast
of
our
pelican
and
from
upon
the
cross
this
one
was
chosen
to
the
great
office
thus
my
lady
nor
yet
moved
she
her
look
from
its
fixed
attention
after
than
before
these
words
of
hers
as
is
he
who
gazes
and
endeavors
to
see
the
sun
eclipsed
a
little
who
through
seeing
becomes
sightless
so
did
i
become
in
respect
to
that
last
fire
till
it
was
said
why
dost
thou
dazzle
thyself
in
order
to
see
a
thing
which
has
no
place
here
on
earth
my
body
is
earth
and
it
will
be
there
with
the
others
until
our
number
corresponds
with
the
eternal
purpose
with
their
two
garments
in
the
blessed
cloister
are
those
two
lights
alone
which
ascended
and
this
thou
shalt
carry
back
unto
your

would
be

as

not
for
vanity
or
love
of
display
a
common
type
of
christ
during
the
middle
ages
because
of
the
popular
belief
that
the
pelican
killed
its
brood
and
then
revived
them
with
its

was
apprehensive
because
of

a
breath
which
made
me
attentive
issued
from
the
effulgent
flame
that
quenched
it
saying
while
thou
art
regaining
the
sense
of
sight
which
thou
hast
consumed
on
me
it
is
well
that
thou
make
up
for
it
by
discourse
begin
then
and
tell
whereto
thy
soul
is
aimed
and
make
thy
reckoning
that
sight
is
in
thee
bewildered
and
not
dead
because
the
lady
who
conducts
thee
through
this
divine
region
has
in
her
look
the
virtue
which
the
band
of
ananias
had
i
said
according
to
her
pleasure
or
soon
or
late
let
the
cure
come
to
the
eyes
which
were
gates
when
she
entered
with
the
fire
wherewith
i
ever
burn
the
good
which
makes
this
court
content
is
alpha
and
omega
of
whatsoever
writing
love
reads
to
me
either
low
or
loud
that

voice
which
had
taken
from
me
fear
of
the
sudden
dazzling
laid
on
me
the
charge
to
speak
further
and
said
surely
with
a
finer
sieve
it
behoves
thee
to
clarify
it
behoves
thee
to
tell
who
directed
thy
bow
to
such
a
target
and
i
by
philosophic
arguments
and
by
authority
that
hence
descends
such
love
must
needs
be
impressed
on
me
for
the
good
so
far
as
it
is
good
in
proportion
as
it
is
understood
kindles
love
and
so
much
the
greater
as
the
more
of
goodness
it
includes
within
itself
therefore
to
the
essence
wherein
is
such
supremacy
that
every
good
which
is
found
outside
of
it
is
naught
else
than
a
beam
of
its
own
radiance
more
than
to
any
other
the
mind
of
every
one
who
discerns
the
truth
on
which
this
argument
is
founded
must
needs
be
moved
in

such
truth
to
my
intelligence
he
makes
plain

demonstrates
to
me
the
first
love
of
all
the
sempiternal
substances
the

it
plain

himself

to
moses
will
make
thee

thou
too
makest
it
plain
to
me

the
lofty
proclamation
which
there
below

all
other

declares
the
secret
of
this
place
on
high
and
i
heard
by
human
understanding
and
by
authorities
concordant
with
it
thy
sovran

looks
unto
god

say
further
if
thou
feelest

cords
draw
thee
towards
him
so
that
thou
mayest
declare
with
how
many
teeth
this

the

iv
the
holy
intention
of
the
eagle
of
christ
was
not
latent
to
me
nay
rather
i
perceived
whither
he
wished
to
lead
my
profession
therefore
i
began
again
all
those
bitings
which
can
make
the
heart
turn
to
god
have
been
concurrent
unto
my
charity
for
the
existence
of
the
world
and
my
own
existence
the
death
that
he
endured
that
i
may
live
and
that
which
all
the
faithful
hope
even
as
i
do
together
with
the
aforesaid
living
knowledge
have
drawn
me
from
the
sea
of
perverted
love
and
have
set
me
on
the
shore
of
the
right
the
leaves
wherewith
all
the
garden
of
the
eternal
gardener
is
enleaved
i
love
in
proportion
as
good
is
borne
unto
them
from
him
have
concurred
to
inspire
me
with
love
of
god
soon
as
i
was
silent
a
most
sweet
song
resounded
through
the
heavens
and
my
lady
said
with
the
rest
holy
holy
holy
and
as
at
a
keen
light
sleep
is
broken
by
the
spirit
of
sight
which
runs
to
the
splendor
that
goes
from
coat
to
coat
and
he
who
awakes
shrinks
from
what
he
sees
so
confused
is
his
sudden
wakening
until
his
judgment
comes
to
his
aid
thus
beatrice
chased
away
every
mote
from
my
eyes
with
the
radiance
of
her
own
which
were
resplendent
more
than
a
thousand
miles
so
that
i
then
saw
better
than
before
and
as
it
were
amazed
i
asked
about
a
fourth
light
which
i
saw
with
us
and
my
lady
within
those
rays
the
first
soul
which
the
first
power
ever
created
gazes
with
joy
upon
its
creator
the
spirit
of
the
sight
runs
to
meet
the
light
which
flashes
through
the
successive
coats
of
the
eye
as
the
bough
that
bends
its
top
at
passing
of
the
wind
and
then
lifts
itself
by
its
own
virtue
which
raises
it
so
did
i
in
amazement
the
while
she
was
speaking
and
then
a
desire
to
speak
wherewith
i
was
burning
gave
me
again
assurance
and
i
began
o
apple
that
alone
wast
produced
mature
o
ancient
father
to
whom
every
bride
is
daughter
and
devoutly
as
i
can
i
supplicate
thee
that
thou
speak
to
me
thou
seest
my
wish
and
in
order
to
hear
thee
quickly
i
do
not
tell
it
sometimes
an
animal
which
is
covered
up
so
stirs
that
his
desire
must
needs
become
apparent
through
the
corresponding
movement
which
that
which
wraps
him
makes
and
in
like
manner
the
first
soul
made
evident
to
me
through
its
covering
how
gladly
it
came
to
do
me
pleasure
then
it
breathed
without
its
being
uttered
to
me
by
thee
i
better
discern
thy
wish
than
thou
whatever
thing
is
most
certain
to
thee
because
i
see
it
in
the
truthful
mirror
which
makes
of
itself
a
likeness
of
other
tbings
while
nothing
makes
for
it
a
likeness
of
itself
thou
wouldst
hear
how
long
it
is
since
god
placed
me
in
the
lofty
garden
where
this
lady
disposed
thee
for
so
long
a
stairway
and
how
long
it
was
a
delight
to
my
eyes
and
the
proper
cause
of
the
great
wrath
and
the
idiom
which
i
used
and
which
i
made
now
my
son
the
tasting
of
the
tree
was
not
by
itself
the
cause
of
so
long
an
exile
but
only
the
overpassing
of
the
bound
there
whence
thy
lady
moved
virgil
i
longed
for
this
assembly
during
four
thousand
three
hundred
and
two
revolutions
of
the
sun
and
while
i
was
on
earth
i
saw
him
return
to
all
the
lights
of
his
path
nine
hundred
and
thirty
times
the
tongue
which
i
spoke
was
all
extinct
long
before
the
people
of
nimrod
attempted
their
unaccomplishable
work

never

for

inebriation
was
entering
through
the

and
through
the
sight
o
joy
o
ineffable
gladness
o
life
entire
of
love

of
peace
o
riches
secure
without
longing
which
leave
nothing
for

before
my
eyes
the

were
standing
enkindled
and
that
which
had
come

began
to
make
itself
more
vivid
and
in
its
semblance
be
came
such
as

the

my

my
place
my

is
vacant
in

of
the

made

a

is

by

paints
the

i

saw
the

and
at

even
thus
did

change

such
eclipse
i

there
was
in

when

suffered
then
his

proceeded
in

that

his

a

the
passage
is
one
of
those
which
shows
that
this
portion
of
the
poem
was
in
hand
during
the
last
years
of
dante
life
in
midwinter
when
the
sun
is
in
capricorn
even
as
our
air
snows
down
flakes
of
frozen
vapors
when
the
horn
of
the
goat
of
heaven
touches
the
sun
so
upward
i
saw
the
aether
become
adorned
and
flaked
with
the
triumphant
vapors
that
had
made
sojourn
there
with
us
my
sight
was
following
their
semblances
and
followed
till
the
intermediate
space
by
its
greatness
pre
vented
it
from
passing
further
onward
whereon
my
lady
who
saw
me
disengaged
from
upward
heeding
said
to
me
cast
down
thy
sight
and
look
how
thou
hast
revolved
the
spirits
since
the
hour
when
i
had
first
looked
i
saw
that
i
had
moved
through
the
whole
are
which
the
first
climate
makes
from
its
middle
to
its
end
so
that
i
saw
beyond
cadiz
the
mad
track
of
ulysses
and
near
on
this
side
the
shore
on
which
europa
became
a
sweet
burden
and
more
of
the
site
of
this
little
would
have
been
discovered
to
me
but
the
sun
was
proceeding
beneath
my
feet
a
sign
and
more
removed
from
dante
first
look
downward
from
the
heavens
at
the
end
of
canto
xxii
to
the
present
moment
he
had
moved
over
the
arc
which
the
first
climate
describes
from
its
middle
to
its
end
the
old
geographers
divided
the
earth
into
seven
zones
called
climates
by
circles
parallel
to
the
equator
the
first
climate
extended
twenty
degrees
to
the
north
of
the
equator
the
sign
of
the
gemini
in
which
dante
was
revolving
in
the
heaven
of
the
fixed
stars
is
in
the
zone
of
the
heavens
corresponding
to
the
first
climate
as
each
climate
extended
on
the
habitable
hemisphere
for
one
hundred
and
eighty
degrees
the
arc
from
its
middle
to
its
end
would
be
of
ninety
degrees
comprised
between
jerusalem
and
cadiz
and
the
time
required
for
passing
through
it
would
be
six
hours
one
fourth
of
the
diurnal
revolution
of
the
heavens
the
shore
of
phoenicia
whence
europa
was
carried
off
by
jupiter
the
sun
in
aries
was
separated
by
taurus
from
gemini
hence
not
all
of
the
hemisphere
of
the
earth
seen
from
gemini
was
illuminated
by
the
sun
which
was
some
three
hours
in
advance
my
enamoured
mind
that
ever
dallies
with
my
lady
was
more
than
ever
burning
to
bring
back
my
eyes
to
her
and
if
nature
has
made
bait
in
human
flesh
or
art
in
its
paintings
to
catch
the
eyes
in
order
to
possess
the
mind
all
united
would
seem
naught
compared
to
the
divine
pleasure
which
shone
upon
me
when
i
turned
me
to
her
smiling
face
and
the
virtue
with
which
the
look
indulged
me
tore
me
from
the
fair
nest
of
leda
and
impelled
me
to
the
swiftest
heaven
from
gemini
the
constellation
of
castor
and
pollux
the
twin
sons
of
leda
the
primum
mobile
or
crystalline
heaven
its
parts
most
living
and
lofty
are
so
uniform
that
i
can
not
tell
which
of
them
beatrice
chose
for
a
place
for
me
but
she
who
saw
my
desire
began
smiling
so
glad
that
god
seemed
to
rejoice
in
her
countenance
the
nature
of
the
world
which
quiets
the
centre
and
moves
all
the
rest
around
it
begins
here
as
from
its
and
this
heaven
has
no
other
where
than
the
divine
mind
in
which
the
love
that
revolves
it
is
kindled
and
the
virtue
which
it
rains
down
light
and
love
enclose
it
with
one
circle
even
as
this
does
the
others
and
of
that
cincture
he
who
girds
it
is
the
sole
intelligence
the
motion
of
this
heaven
is
not
marked
out
by
another
but
the
others
are
measured
by
this
even
as
ten
by
a
half
and
by
a
fifth
and
how
time
can
hold
its
roots
in
such
a
and
in
the
others
its
leaves
may
now
be
manifest
to
thee
the
world
of
the
revolving
heavens
the
angelic
intelligences
move
the
lower
heavens
but
of
the
empyrean
god
himself
is
the
immediate
governor
the
reversal
of
magnitudes
makes
this
image
obscure
the
motion
of
the
crystalline
heaven
the
swiftest
of
all
determines
the
slower
motions
of
the
heavens
below
it
and
divides
them
as
five
and
two
divide
ten
the
fixed
unit
of
time
is
the
day
which
is
established
by
the
revolution
of
the
primum
mobile
o
covetousness
which
whelms
mortals
beneath
thee
so
that
no
one
has
power
to
withdraw
his
eyes
from
out
thy
waves
well
blossoms
the
will
in
men
but
the
continual
rain
converts
the
true
plums
into
wildings
faith
and
innocence
are
found
only
in
children
then
both
fly
away
ere

the
cheeks
are
covered

so
long
as

stammers
fasts
who
afterward
when
his
tongue
is
loosed
devours
whatever
food
under
whatever
moon
and
one
while
stammering
loves
his
mother
and
listens
to
her
who
when
speech
is
perfect
desires
then
to
see
her
buried
so
the
skin
of
the
fair
daughter
of
him
who
brings
morning
and
leaves
evening
white
in
its
first
aspect
becomes
black
do
thou
in
order
that
thou
make
not
marvel
reflect
that
on
earth
there
is
no
one
who
governs
wherefore
the
human
family
is
gone
astray
but
ere
january
be
all
by
that
hundredth
part
which
is
down
there
neglected
these
supernal
circles
shall
so
roar
that
the
storm
which
is
so
long
awaited
shall
turn
the
sterns
round
to
where
the
prows
are
so
that
the
fleet
shall
run
straight
and
true
fruit
shall
come
after
the
flower
the
connection
of
the
ideas
presented
in
what
precedes
with
this
denunciation
of
covetousness
or
selfishness
is
not
at
first
apparent
but
the
transition
is
not
unnatural
from
the
consideration
of
the
heaven
which
pours
down
divine
influence
to
the
thought
of
the
engrossment
of
men
in
the
pursuit
of
their
selfish
and
transitory
ends
in
which
they
are
blinded
to
heavenly
and
eternal
good
both
the
order
of
the
words
and
the
meaning
of
this
sentence
axe
obscure
before
january
falls
in
spring
owing
to
the
lack
of
correctness
in
the
calendar
by
which
the
year
is
lengthened
by
about
a
day
in
each
century
it
is
as
if
the
poet
said
before
a
thousand
years
shall
pass
meaning
within
short
while
canto
xxviii
the
heavenly
hierarchy
after
she
who
imparadises
my
mind
had
disclosed
the
truth
counter
to
the
present
life
of
wretched
mortals
as
he
who
is
lighted
by
a
candle
from
behind
sees
its
flame
in
a
mirror
before
he
has
it
in
sight
or
in
thought
and
turns
round
to
see
if
the
glass
tell
him
the
truth
and
sees
that
it
accords
with
it
as
the
note
with
its
measure
i
thus
my
memory
recollects
that
i
did
looking
into
the
beautiful
eyes
wherewith
love
made
the
cord
to
ensnare
me
and
when
i
turned
and
mine
were
touched
by
that
which
is
apparent
in
that
revolving
sphere
whenever
one
gazes
fixedly
on
its
gyration
i
saw
a
point
which
was
raying
out
light
so
keen
that
the
sight
on
which
it
blazes
must
needs
close
because
of
its
intense
keenness
and
whatso
star
seems
smallest
here
would
seem
a
moon
if
placed
beside
it
as
star
with
star
is
placed
perhaps
as
near
as
a
halo
seems
to
girdle
the
light
which
paints
it
when
the
vapor
that
bears
it
is
most
dense
at
such
distance
round
the
point
a
circle
of
fire
was
whirling
so
swiftly
that
it
would
have
surpassed
that
motion
which
with
most
speed
girds
the
world
and
this
was
by
another
circumcinct
and
that
by
the
third
and
the
third
then
by
the
fourth
by
the
fifth
the
fourth
and
then
by
the
sixth
the
fifth
thereon
the
seventh
followed
so
spread
now
in
compass
that
the
messenger
of
juno
entire
would
be
narrow
to
contain
it
so
the
eighth
and
the
ninth
and
each
was
moving
more
slowly
according
as
it
was
in
number
more
distant
from
the
first
and
that
one
had
the
clearest
flame
from
which
the
pure
spark
was
least
distant
i
believe
because
it
partakes
more
of
it
my
lady
who
saw
me
deeply
suspense
in
doubt
said
on
that
point
heaven
and
all
nature
are
dependent
gaze
on
that
circle
which
is
most
conjoined
to
it
and
know
that
its
motion
is
so
swift
because
of
the
burning
love
whereby
it
is
spurred
and
i
to
her
if
the
world
were
set
in
the
order
which
i
see
in
those
wheels
that
which
is
propounded
to
me
would
have
satisfied
me
but
in
the
world
of
sense
the
revolutions
may
be
seen
so
much
the
more
divine
as
they
are
more
remote
from
the
centre
wherefore
if
my
desire
is
to
have
end
in
this
marvellous
and
angelic
temple
which
has
for
confine
only
love
and
light
i
need
yet
to
hear
why
the
example
and
the
exemplar
go
not
in
one
fashion
because
i
by
myself
contemplate
this
in
vain
if
thy
fingers
are
insufficient
for
such
a
knot
it
is
no
wonder
so
hard
has
it
become
through
not
being
tried
thus
my
lady
then
she
said
take
that
which
i
shall
tell
thee
if
thou
wouldest
be
satisfied
and
make
subtle
thy
wit
about
it
the
corporeal
circles
are
wide
and
narrow
according
to
the
more
or
less
of
virtue
which
is
spread
through
all
their
parts
greater
goodness
must
make
greater
welfare
the
greater
body
if
it
has
its
parts
equally
complete
contains
greater
welfare
hence
this
one
which
sweeps
along
with
itself
all
the
rest
of
the
universe
corresponds
to
the
circle
which
loves
most
and
knows
most
therefore
if
thou
compassest
thy
measure
round
the
virtue
not
round
the
seeming
of
the
substances
which
appear
circular
to
thee
thou
wilt
see
in
each
heaven
a
marvellous
agreement
with
its
intelligence
of
greater
to
more
and
of
smaller
to
less
as
the
note
of
the
song
with
the
measure
of
the
verse
the
eyes
of
beatrice
reflected
as
a
mirror
the
light
which
shone
from
god
the
full
circle
of
iris
or
the
rainbow
these
circles
of
fire
are
the
nine
orders
of
angels
the
planetary
spheres
partake
more
of
the
divine
nature
and
move
more
swiftly
in
proportion
to
their
distance
from
the
earth
their
centre
the
planetary
spheres
the
ninth
sphere
of
the
angelic
hierarchy
the
greater
heaven
corresponds
to
the
angelic
circle
of
the
intelligences
which
love
god
most
and
know
most
of
him
the
smaller
to
that
of
those
which
love
and
know
least
as
the
hemisphere
of
the
air
remains
splendid
and
serene
when
boreas
blows
from
that
cheek
wherewith
he
is
mildest
whereby
the
mist
which
first
troubled
it
is
cleared
and
dissolved
so
that
the
heaven
smiles
to
us
with
the
beauties
of
all
its
flock
so
i
became
after
my
lady
had
provided
me
with
her
clear
answer
and
like
a
star
in
heaven
the
truth
was
seen
when
boreas
blows
the
north
wind
more
from
the
west
than
from
the
east
and
after
her
words
had
stopped
not
otherwise
does
molten
iron
throw
out
sparks
than
the
circles
sparkled
every
scintillation
followed
its
flame
and
they
were
so
many
that
their
number
was
of
more
thousands
than
the
doubling
of
the
chess
i
heard
hosaimah
sung
from
choir
to
choir
to
the
fixed
point
that
holds
them
and
will
forever
hold
them
at
the
ubi
in
which
they
have
ever
been
and
she
who
saw
the
dubious
thoughts
within
my
mind
said
the
first
circles
have
shown
to
thee
the
seraphim
and
the
cherubim
thus
swiftly
they
follow
their
own
bonds
in
order
to
liken
themselves
to
the
point
so
far
as
they
can
and
they
can
so
far
as
they
are
exalted
to
see
those
other
loves
which
go
round
about
them
are
called
thrones
of
the
divine
aspect
because
they
terminated
the
first
triad
and
thou
shouldst
know
that
all
have
delight
in
proportion
as
their
vision
penetrates
into
the
true
in
which
every
understanding
is
at
rest
hence
may
be
seen
how
beatitude
is
founded
on
the
act
which
sees
not
on
that
which
loves
which
follows
after
and
merit
which
grace
and
good
will
bring
forth
is
the
measure
of
this
seeing
thus
is
the
progress
from
grade
to
grade
the
innumerable
sparks
each
moved
in
accord
with
the
gyration
of
its
flaming
circle
the
doubling
of
the
chess
alludes
to
the
story
that
the
inventor
of
the
game
asked
as
his
reward
from
the
king
of
persia
a
grain
of
wheat
for
the
first
square
of
the
board
two
for
the
second
and
so
on
to
the
last
or
square
the
number
reached
by
this
process
of
duplication
extends
to
twenty
figures

where

written
to
you
of
the
angels
created
a
long
tract
of
centuries
before
the
rest
of
the

was
made
but
this
truth
is
written
on
many
pages
by
the
writers
of
the
that
holy
spirit
and
thou
wilt
thyself
discover
it
if
thou
watchest
well
for
it
and
even
the
reason
sees
it
somewhat
for
it
would
not
admit
that
the

could
be
so

without

thou

where

were

so
that
three

of
thy

quenched

at

hangs

there

the

in
which
potency
and

are
united
are
the
creatures
endowed
with
bodies
and
souls
the
truth
here
set
forth
contrary
to
jerome
assertion
the
creation
of
the
angels
was
contemporaneous
with
that
of
the
creation
of
the
rest
of
the
universe
of
which
they
were
the
intelligences
without
scope
for
their
action
as
movers
of
the
spheres
one
would
not
reach
to
twenty
in
counting
so
quickly
as
a
part
of
the
angels
disturbed
the
subject
of
your
elements
the
rest
remained
and
began
this
art
which
thou
beboldest
with
such
great
delight
that
they
never
cease
from
circling
the
origin
of
the
fall
was
the
accursed
pride
of
him
whom
thou
hast
seen
opprest
by
all
the
weights
of
the
world
those
whom
thou
seest
here
were
modest
in
grateful
recognition
of
the
goodness
which
had
made
them
ready
for
intelligence
so
great
wherefore
their
vision
was
exalted
with
illuminant
grace
and
with
their
merit
so
that
they
have
full
and
steadfast
will
and
i
wish
that
thou
doubt
not
but
be
certain
that
to
receive
grace
is
meritorious
in
proportion
as
the
affection
is
open
to
it
the
earth
henceforth
if
my
words
have
been
harvested
thou
canst
contemplate
sufficiently
round
about
this
consistory
without
other
assistance
but
because
on
earth
it
is
taught
in
your
schools
that
the
angelic
nature
is
such
that
it
understands
and
remembers
and
wills
i
will
speak
further
in
order
that
thou
mayest
see
the
truth
pure
which
there
below
is
mixed
through
the
equivocation
in
such
like
teaching
these
substances
from
the
time
that
they
were
glad
in
the
face
of
god
have
not
turned
their
sight
from
it
from
which
nothing
is
concealed
therefore
they
have
not
their
vision
interrupted
by
a
new
object
and
therefore
do
not
need
because
of
divided
thought
to
recollect
so
that
there
below
men
dream
when
not
asleep
believing
and
not
believing
to
speak
truth
but
in
the
one
is
more
fault
and
more
shame
ye
below
go
not
along
one
path
in
philosophizing
so
much
do
the
love
of
appearance
and
the
thought
of
it
transport
you
and
yet
this
is
endured
hereabove
with
less
indignation
than
when
the
divine
scripture
is
set
aside
or
when
it
is
perverted
men
think
not
there
how
much
blood
it
costs
to
sow
it
in
the
world
and
how
much
he
pleases
who
humbly
keeps
close
to
its
side
every
one
strives
for
appearance
and
makes
his
own
inventions
and
those
are
discoursed
of
by
the
preachers
and
the
gospel
is
silent
one
says
that
the
moon
turned
back
at
the
passion
of
christ
and
interposed
herself
so
that
the
light
of
the
sun
reached
not
down
and
others
that
the
light
hid
itself
of
its
own
accord

that
this

answered
for
the
spaniards

for

who
have
no
knowledge
return
from
the
pasture
fed
with
wind
and
not
seeing
the
harm
does
not
excuse
them
christ
did
not
say
to
his
first
company
and
preach
idle
stories
to
the
world
but
he
gave
to
them
the
true
foundation
and
that
alone
sounded
in
their
cheeks
so
that
in
the
battle
for
kindling
of
the
faith
they
made
shield
and
lance
of
the
gospel
now
men
go
forth
to
preach
with

and
with

and
provided
only
there
is
a

such

if

they
would
see
the

in
which
they
confide
through

such
great
folly
has
grown

most
even

remembrance

smile
deprives
my

that
i
saw
her
face
in

even

this

the
following
with
my

has

further

her
beauty
in
my
verse
as
at
his
utmost
every
artist
such
as
i
leave
her
to
a
greater
heralding
than
that
of
my
trumpet
which
is
bringing
its
arduous
theme
to
a
close
with
act
and
voice
of
a
trusty

she
began
again
we
have
issued

greatest
body

light
intellectual
full

love

true
good
full

joy
joy
which

and
the
other
host
of

and
the
one
in
those
aspects
which
thou
shalt
see
at
the
last
judgment
the
primum
mobile
the
greatest
of
the
material
spheres
of
the
universe
the
empyrean
the
spirits
of
the
redeemed
who
fought
against
the
temptations
of
the
world
and
the
good
angels
who
fought
against
the
rebellious
and
here
the
souls
in

will
be
seen
in
their

shapes

sudden
flash
which
scatters
the
spirits
of
the
sight
so
that
it
deprives
the
eye
of
the
action
of
the
strongest
objects
thus
a
vivid
light
shone
round
about
me
and
left
me
swathed
with
such
a
veil
of
its
own
effulgence
that
nothing
was
visible
to
me
so
that
the
clearest
objects
produce
no
effect
upon
the
eye
the
love
which
quieteth
this
heaven
always
welcomes
to
itself
with
such
a
salutation
in
order
to
make
the
candle
ready
for
its
flame
no
sooner
had
these
brief
words
come
within
me
than
i
comprehended
that
i
was
surmounting
above
my
own
power
and
i
rekindled
me
with
a
new
vision
such
that
no
light
is
so
pure
that
my
eyes
had
not
sustained
it
and
i
saw
light
in
form
of
a
river
bright
with
effulgence
between
two
banks
painted
with
a
marvellous
spring
out
of
this
stream
were
issuing
living
sparks
and
on
every
side
were
setting
themselves
in
the
flowers
like
rubies
which
gold
encompasses
then
as
if
inebriated
by
the
odors
they
plunged
again
into
the
wonderful
flood
and
as
one
was
entering
another
was
issuing
forth
the
high
desire
which
now
inflames
and
urges
thee
to
have
knowledge
concerning
that
which
thou
seest
pleases
me
the
more
the
more
it
swells
but
thou
must
needs
drink
of
this
water
before
so
great
a
thirst
in
thee
be
slaked
thus
the
sun
of
my
eyes
said
to
me
thereon
she
added
the
stream
and
the
topazes
which
enter
and
issue
and
the
smiling
of
the
herbage
are
foreshadowing
prefaces
of
their
truth
not
that
these
things
are
in
themselves
immature
but
there
is
defect
on
thy
part
who
hast
not
yet
vision
so
lofty
the
stream
the
sparks
the
flowers
are
not
such
in
reality
as
they
seem
to
be
they
are
but
images
foreshadowing
the
truth
the
things
show
themselves
as
they
are
but
the
eyes
can
not
yet
see
them
correctly
there
is
no
babe
who
so
hastily
springs
with
face
toward
the
milk
if
he
awake
much
later
than
his
wont
as
i
did
to
make
better
mirrors
yet
of
my
eyes
stooping
to
the
wave
which
flows
in
order
that
one
may
be
bettered
in
it
and
even
as
the
eaves
of
my
eyelids
drank
of
it
so
it
seemed
to
me
from
its
length
to
become
round
then
as
folk
who
have
been
under
masks
who
seem
other
than
before
if
they
divest
themselves
of
the
semblance
not
their
own
in
which
they
disappeared
thus
for
me
the
flowers
and
the
sparks
were
changed
into
greater
festival
so
that
i
saw
both
the
courts
of
heaven
manifest
o
splendor
of
god
by
means
of
which
i
saw
the
high
triumph
of
the
true
kingdom
give
me
power
to
tell
how
i
saw
it
light
is
thereabove
which
makes
the
creator
visible
to
that
creature
which
has
its
peace
only
in
seeing
him
and
it
is
extended
in
a
circular
figure
so
far
that
its
circumference
would
be
too
wide
a
girdle
for
the
sun
its
whole
appearance
is
made
of
a
ray
reflected
from
the
summit
of
the
first
moving
heaven
which
therefrom
takes

that
naught

had
all

in

scintillating
on

so

look
down

coming

such
that
every

it
is
covered
by
helice
revolving
with
her
son
of
whom
she
is
fond
when
they
beheld
rome
and

work
were
wonderstruck
what
time
lateran
rose
above
mortal
things
i
who
to
the
divine
from
the
human
to
the
eternal
from
the
temporal
had
come
and
from
florence
to
a
people
just
and
sane
with
what
amazement
must
i
have
been
full
surely
what
with
it
and
the
joy
i
was
well
pleased
not
to
hear
and
to
stand
mute
and
as
a
pilgrim
who
is
refreshed
in
the
temple
of
his
vow
in
looking
round
and
hopes
now
to
report
how
it
was
so
journeying
through
the
living
light
i
carried
my
eyes
over
the
ranks
now
up
now
down
and
now
circling
about
i
saw
faces
persuasive
to
love
beautified
by
the
light
of
another
and
by
their
own
smile
and
actions
ornate
with
every
dignity
the
nymph
callisto
or

bore
to

a

she
was
metamorphosed
by
hera
into

and
then
transferred
to

as
the

of
the
great
bear
while
her
son
was
changed
into
the
constellation
of
aretophylax
or
bootes
in
the
far
north
these
constellations
remain
always
above
the
horizon
when
rome
was
mistress
of
the
world
and
the
lateran
the
seat
of
imperial
or
papal
power
my
look
had
now
comprehended
the
general
form
of
paradise
as
a
whole
and
on
no
part
yet
my
sight
was
fixed
and
i
turned
me
with
wish
to
ask
my
lady
about
things
concerning
which
my
mind
was
in
suspense
one
thing
i
was
meaning
and
another
answered
me
i
was
thinking
to
see
beatrice
and
i
saw
an
old
man
robed
like
the
people
in
glory
his
eyes
and
his
cheeks
were
overspread
with
benignant
joy
in
pious
mien
such
as
befits
a
tender
father
and
where
is
she
on
a
sudden
said
whereon
he
to
terminate
thy
desire
beatrice
urged
me
from
my
place
and
if
thou
lookest
up
to
the
third
circle
from
the
highest
step
thou
wilt
again
see
her
upon
the
throne
which
her
merits
have
allotted
to
her
without
answering
i
lifted
up
my
eyes
and
saw
her
as
she
made
for
herself
a
crown
reflecting
from
herself
the
eternal
rays
from
that
region
which
thunders
highest
up
no
mortal
eye
is
so
far
distant
in
whatsoever
sea
it
loses
itself
the
lowest
as
there
from
beatrice
was
my
sight
but
this
was
naught
to
me
for
her
image
did
not
descend
to
me
blurred
by
aught
between
from
the
highest
region
of
the
air
to
the
lowest
depth
of
the
sea
o
lady
in
whom
my
hope
is
strong
and
who
for
my
salvation
didst
endure
to
leave
thy
footprints
in
hell
of
all
those
things
which
i
have
seen
i
recognize
by
thy
power
and
by
thy
goodness
the
grace
and
the
virtue
thou
hast
drawn
me
from
servitude
to
liberty
by
all
those
ways
by
all
the
modes
whereby
thou
hadst
the
power
to
do
this
guard
thou
in
me
thine
own
magnificence
so
that
my
soul
which
thou
hast
made
whole
may
pleasing
to
thee
be
unloosed
from
the
body
thus
i
prayed
and
she
so
distant
smiled
as
it
seemed
and
looked
at
me
then
turned
to
the
eternal
fountain
and
the
holy
old
man
in
order
that
thou
mayest
complete
perfectly
he
said
thy
journey
whereto
prayer
and
holy
love
sent
me
fly
with
thy
eyes
through
this
garden
for
seeing
it
will
prepare
thy
look
to
mount
further
through
the
divine
radiance
and
the
queen
of
heaven
for
whom
i
burn
wholly
with
love
will
grant
us
every
grace
because
i
am
her
faithful
bernard
bernard
to
whom
because
of
his
fervent
devotion
to
her
the
blessed
virgin
had
deigned
to
show
herself
during
his
life
as
is
he
who
comes
perchance
from
croatia
to
see
our
veronica
who
is
not
satisfied
by
its
ancient
fame
but
says
in
thought
while
it
is
shown
my
lord
jesus
christ
true
god
now
was
your
semblance
like
to
this
such
was
i
gazing
on
the
living
charity
of
him
who
in
this
world
in
contemplation
tasted
of
that
peace
the
likeness
of
the
saviour
miraculously
impressed
upon
the
kerchief
presented
to
him
by
a
holy
woman
on
his
way
to
calvary
wherewith
to
wipe
the
sweat
and
dust
from
his
face
and
now
religiously
preserved
at
rome
and
shown
at
peter
on
certain
holydays
son
of
grace
this
glad
existence
began
he
will
not
be
known
to
thee
holding
thine
eyes
only
below
here
at
the
bottom
but
look
on
the
circles
even
to
the
most
remote
until
thou
seest
upon
her
seat
the
queen
to
whom
this
realm
is
subject
and
devoted
i
lifted
up
my
eyes
and
as
at
morning
the
eastern
parts
of
the
horizon
surpass
that
where
the
sun
declines
thus
as
if
going
with
my
eyes
from
valley
to
mountain
i
saw
a
part
on
the
extreme
verge
vanquishing
in
light
all
the
other
front
and
even
as
there
where
the
pole
which
phaeton
guided
ill
is
awaited
the
flame
is
brighter
and
on
this
side
and
that
the
light
grows
less
so
that
pacific
oriflamme
was
vivid
at
the
middle
and
on
each
side
in
equal
measure
the
flame
slackened
and
at
that
mid
part
i
saw
more
than
a
thousand
jubilant
angels
with
wings
outspread
each
distinct
both
in
brightness
and
in
act
i
saw
there
smiling
at
their
sports
and
at
their
songs
a
beauty
which
was
joy
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
other
saints
and
if
i
had
such
wealth
in
speech
as
in
imagining
i
should
not
dare
to
attempt
the
least
of
its
delightfulness
bernard
when
he
saw
my
eyes
fixed
and
intent
upon
its
warm
glow
turned
his
own
with
such
affection
to
it
that
he
made
mine
more
ardent
to
gaze
anew
where
the
chariot
of
the
sun
is
about
to
rise
the
virgin
canto

bernard
describes
the
order
of
the
rose
and
points
out
many
of
the
the
children
in

angelic
the
patricians
of
the
court
of
heaven
fixed
in
affection
upon
his
delight
that
contemplator
freely
assumed
the
office
of
a
teacher
and
began
these
holy
words
the
wound
which
mary
closed
up
and
anointed
she
who
is
so
beautiful
at
her
feet
is
she
who
opened
it
and
who
pierced
it

her

who
through
sorrow
for
his
sin
said
miserere
mei
thou
mayest
see
thus
from
step
to
step
in
gradation
downward
as
with
the
name
of
each
i
go
downward
through
the
rose
from
leaf
to
leaf
and
from
the
seventh
row
downwards
even
as
down
to
it
hebrew
women
follow
in
succession
dividing
all
the
tresses
of
the
flower
because
these
are
the
wall
by
which
the
sacred
stairways
are
separated
according
to
the
look
which
faith
turned
on
christ
on
this
side
where
the
flower
is
mature
with
all
its
leaves
are
seated
those
who
believed
in
christ
about
to
come
on
the
other
side
where
the
semicircles
are
broken
by
empty
spaces
are
those
who
turned
their
faces
on
christ
already
come
and
as
on
this
side
the
glorious
seat
of
the
lady
of
heaven
and
the
other
seats
below
it
make
so
great
a
division
thus
opposite
does
that
of
the
great
john
who
ever
holy
endured
the
desert
and
martyrdom
and
then
hell
for
two
years
and
beneath
him
francis
and
benedict
and
augustine
and
others
are
allotted
thfis
to
divide
far
down
as
here
from
circle
to
circle
now
behold
the
high
divine
foresight
for
one
and
the
other
aspect
of
the
faith
will
fill
this
garden
equally
and
know
that
downwards
from
the
row
which
midway
cleaves
the
two
divisions
they
are
seated
for
no
merit
of
their
own
but
for
that
of
others
under
certain
conditions
for
all
these
are
spirits
absolved
ere
they
had
true
election
well
canst
thou
perceive
it
by
their
looks
and
also
by
their
childish
voices
if
thou
lookest
well
upon
them
and
if
thou
listenest
to
them
now
thou
art
perplexed
and
in
perplexity
art
silent
but
i
will
loose
for
thee
the
strong
bond
in
which
thy
subtile
thoughts
fetter
thee
within
the
amplitude
of
this
realm
a
casual
point
can
have
no
place
any
more
than
sadness
or
thirst
or
hunger
for
whatever
thou
seest
is
established
by
eternal
law
so
that
here
the
ring
answers
exactly
to
the
finger
and
therefore
this
folk
hastened
to
true
life
is
not
sine
causa
more
and
less
excellent
here
among
itself
the
king
through
whom
this
realm
reposes
in
such
great
love
and
in
such
great
delight
that
no
will
is
venturesome
for
more
creating
all
the
minds
in
his
own
glad
aspect
diversely
endows
with
grace
according
to
his
own
pleasure
and
here
let
the
fact
suffice
and
this
is
expressly
and
clearly
noted
for
you
in
the
holy
scripture
in
those
twins
who
while
within
their
mother
had
their
anger
roused
therefore
according
to
the
color
of
the
hair
of
such
grace
it
behoves
the
highest
light
befittingly
to
crown
them
without
then
merit
from
their
modes
of
efe
they
are
placed
in
different
grades
differing
only
in
their
primary
keenness
of
vision
thus
in
the
fresh
centuries
the
faith
of
parents
alone
sufficed
together
with
innocence
to
secure
salvation
after
the
first
ages
were
complete
it
was
needful
for
males
with
their
innocent
plumage
to
acquire
virtue
through
circumcision
but
after
the
time
of
grace
had
come
without
perfect

sittest
through
eternal
allotment
who
is
that
angel
who
with
such
jubilee
looks
into
the
eyes
of
our
queen
so
enamoured
that
he
seems
of
fire
thus
i
again
had
recourse
to
the
teaching
of
him
who
was
made
beautiful
by
mary
as
the
morning
star
by
the
sun
and
he
to
me
confidence
and
grace
as
much
as
there
can
be
in
angel
and
in
soul
axe
all
in
him
and
so
we
would
have
it
be
for
he
it
is
who
bore
the
palm
down
to
mary
when
the
son
of
god
willed
to
load
himself
with
our
burden
but
come
now
with
thine
eyes
as
i
shall
go
on
speaking
and
note
the
great
patricians
of
this
most
just
and
pious
empire
those
two
who
sit
there
above
most
happy
through
being
nearest
to
the
empress
are
as
it
were
the
two
roots
of
this
rose
he
who
on
the
left
is
close
to
her
is
the
father
through
whose
rash
taste
the
human
race
tastes
so
much
bitterness
on
the
right
thou
seest
that
ancient
father
of
holy
church
to
whom
christ
entrusted
the
keys
of
this
lovely
flower
and
he
who
saw
before
his
death
all
the
heavy
times
of
the
beautiful
bride
who
was
won
with
the
lance
and
with
the
nails
sits
at
his
side
and
alongside
the
other
rests
that
leader
under
whom
the
ingrate
fickle
and
stubborn
people
lived
on
manna
opposite
peter
thou
seest
anna
sitting
so
content
to
gaze
upon
her
daughter
that
she
moves
not
her
eyes
while
singing
hosannah
and
opposite
the
eldest
father
of
a
family
sits
lucia
who
moved
thy
lady
when
thou
didst
bend
thy
brow
to
rush
downward
but
because
the
time
flies
which
holds
thee
slumbering
here
will
we
make
a
stop
like
a
good
tailor
who
makes
the
gown
according
as
he
has
cloth
and
we
will
direct
our
eyes
to
the
first
love
so
that
looking
towards
him
thou
mayst
penetrate
so
far
as
is
possible
through
his
effulgence
truly
lest
perchance
moving
thy
wings
thou
go
backward
believing
to
advance
it
is
needful
that
grace
be
obtained
by
prayer
grace
from
her
who
has
the
power
to
aid
thee
and
do
thou
follow
me
with
thy
affection
so
that
thy
heart
depart
not
from
my
speech
this
is
the
single
passage
in
which
dante
implies
that
his
vision
is
of
the
nature
of
a
dream
and
he
began
this
holy
supplication
canto
xxxiii
prayer
to
the
the
beatific
the
ultimate
salvation
virgin
mother
daughter
of
thine
own
son
humble
and
exalted
more
than
any
creature
fixed
term
of
the
eternal
counsel
thou
art
she
who
didst
so
ennoble
human
nature
that
its
own
maker
disdained
not
to
become
his
own
making
within
thy
womb
was
rekindled
the
love
through
whose
warmth
this
flower
has
thus
blossomed
in
the
eternal
peace
here
thou
art
to
us
the
noonday
torch
of
charity
and
below
among
mortals
thou
art
the
living
fount
of
hope
lady
thou
art
so
great
and
so
availest
that
whoso
wishes
grace
and
has
not
recourse
to
thee
wishes
his
desire
to
fly
without
wings
thy
benignity
not
only
succors
him
who
asks
but
oftentimes
freely
foreruns
the
asking
in
thee
mercy
in
thee
pity
in
thee
magnificence
in
thee
whatever
of
goodness
is
in
any
creature
are
united
now
doth
this
man
who
from
the
lowest
abyss
of
the
universe
far
even
as
here
has
seen
one
by
one
the
lives
of
spirits
supplicate
thee
through
grace
for
virtue
such
that
he
may
be
able
with
his
eyes
to
uplift
himself
higher
toward
the
ultimate
salvation
and
i
who
never
for
my
own
vision
burned
more
than
i
do
for
his
proffer
to
thee
all
my
prayers
and
pray
that
they
be
not
scant
that
with
thy
prayers
thou
wouldest
dissipate
for
him
every
cloud
of
his
mortality
so
that
the
supreme
pleasure
may
be
displayed
to
him
further
i
pray
thee
queen
who
canst
whatso
thou
wilt
that
after
so
great
a
vision
thou
wouldest
preserve
his
affections
sound
may
thy
guardianship
vanquish
human
impulses
behold
beatrice
with
all
the
blessed
for
my
prayers
clasp
their
hands
to
thee
in
the
second
nun
tale
chaucer
has
rendered
with
great
beauty
the
larger
part
of
this
prayer
the
eyes
beloved
and
revered
by
god
fixed
on
the
speaker
showed
to
us
how
pleasing
unto
her
are
devout
prayers
then
to
the
eternal
light
were
they
directed
on
which
it
is
not
to
be
believed
that
eye
so
clear
is
turned
by
any
creature
and
i
who
to
the
end
of
all
desires
was
approaching
even
as
i
ought
ended
within
myself
the
ardor
of
my
longing
bernard
was
beckoning
to
me
and
was
smiling
that
i
should
look
upward
but
i
was
already
of
my
own
accord
such
as
he
wished
for
my
sight
becoming
pure
was
entering
more
and
more
through
the
radiance
of
the
lofty
light
which
of
itself
is
true
the
ardor
of
longing
ceased
as
was
natural
in
the
consummation
and
enjoyment
of
desire
thenceforward
my
vision
was
greater
than
our
speech
which
yields
to
such
a
sight
and
the
memory
yields
to
such
excess
vague
words
but
ah
how
hard
to
frame
in
forms
of
speech
or
for
intellect
to
reach
thro
memory
that
which
i
became
in
memoriam
xcv
as
is
he
who
dreaming
sees
and
after
the
dream
the
passion
remains
imprinted
and
the
rest
returns
not
to
the
mind
such
am
i
for
my
vision
almost
wholly
fails
while
the
sweetness
that
was
born
of
it
yet
distils
within
my
heart
thus
the
snow
is
by
the
sun
unsealed
thus
on
the
wind
in
the
light
leaves
was
lost
the
saying
of
the
sibyl
o
supreme
light
that
so
high
upliftest
thyself
from
mortal
conceptions
a
little
to
my
mind
of
what
thou
didst
appear
and
make
my
tongue
so
powerful
that
it
may
be
able
to
leave
one
single
spark
of
thy
glory
for
the
future
people
for
by
returning
somewhat
to
my
memory
and
by
sounding
a
little
in
these
verses
more
of
thy
victory
shall
be
conceived
i
think
that
by
the
keenness
of
the
living
ray
which
i
endured
i
should
have
been
bewildered
if
my
eyes
had
been
averted
from
it
and
it
comes
to
my
mind
that
for
this
reason
i
was
the
more
hardy
to
sustain
so
much
that
i
joined
my
look
unto
the
infinite
goodness
o
abundant
grace
whereby
i
presumed
to
fix
my
eyes
through
the
eternal
light
so
far
that
there
i
consumed
my
sight
in
its
depth
i
saw
that
whatsoever
is
dispersed
through
the
universe
is
there
included
bound
with
love
in
one
volume
substance
and
accidents
and
their
modes
fused
together
as
it
were
in
such
wise
that
that
of
which
i
speak
is
one
simple
light
the
universal
form
of
this
knot
i
believe
that
i
saw
because
in
saying
this
i
feel
that
i
more
at
large
rejoice
one
instant
only
is
greater
oblivion
for
me
than
five
and
twenty
centuries
to
the
emprise
which
made
neptune
wonder
at
the
shadow
of
argo
this
union
of
substance
and
accident
and
their
modes
the
unity
of
creation
in
the
creator
the
mysteries
of
god
vanish
in
an
instant
from
memory
but
the
larger
joy
felt
in
recording
them
is
proof
that
they
were
seen
thus
my
mind
wholly
rapt
was
gazing
fixed
motionless
and
intent
and
ever
with
gazing
grew
enkindled
in
that
light
one
becomes
such
that
it
is
impossible
he
should
ever
consent
to
turn
himself
from
it
for
other
sight
because
the
good
which
is
the
object
of
the
will
is
all
collected
in
it
and
outside
of
it
that
is
defective
which
is
perfect
there
now
will
my
speech
be
shorter
even
in
respect
to
that
which
i
remember
than
an
infant
who
still
bathes
his
tongue
at
the
breast
not
because
more
than
one
simple
semblance
was
in
the
living
light
wherein
i
was
gazing
which
is
always
such
as
it
was
before
but
through
my
sight
which
was
growing
strong
in
me
as
i
looked
one
sole
appearance
as
i
myself
changed
was
altering
itself
to
me
within
the
profound
and
clear
subsistence
of
the
lofty
light
appeared
to
me
three
circles
of
three
colors
and
of
one
dimension
and
one
appeared
reflected
by
the
other
as
iris
by
iris
and
the
third
appeared
fire
which
from
the
one
and
from
the
other
is
equally
breathed
forth
as
one
arch
of
the
rainbow
by
the
other
o
how
short
is
the
telling
and
how
feeble
toward
my
conception
and
this
toward
what
i
saw
is
such
that
it
suffices
not
to
call
it
little
o
light
eternal
that
sole
dwellest
in
thyself
sole
understandest
thyself
and
by
thyself
understood
and
understanding
lovest
and
smilest
on
thyself
that
circle
which
thus
conceived
appeared
in
thee
as
a
reflected
light
being
somewhile
regarded
by
my
eyes
seemed
to
me
depicted
within
itself
of
its
own
very
color
by
our
effigy
wherefore
my
sight
was
wholly
set
upon
it
as
is
the
geometer
who
wholly
applies
himself
to
measure
the
circle
and
finds
not
by
thinking
that
principle
of
which
he
is
in
need
such
was
i
at
that
new
sight
i
wished
to
see
how
the
image
accorded
with
the
circle
and
how
it
has
its
place
therein
but
my
own
wings
were
not
for
this
had
it
not
been
that
my
mind
was
smitten
by
a
flash
in
which
its
wish
came
to
my
high
fantasy
here
power
failed
but
now
my
desire
and
my
will
like
a
wheel
which
evenly
is
moved
the
lovee
was
turning
which
moves
the
sun
and
the
other
stars
