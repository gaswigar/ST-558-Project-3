the
three
sisters
i
north
of
east
in
the
bottom
where
the
road
drops
from
the
high
moor
is
the
village
of
garth
in
garthdale
it
crouches
there
with
a
crook
of
the
dale
behind
and
before
it
between
doors
of
the
west
and
south
under
the
mystery
and
terror
of
its
solitude
it
crouches
like
a
beaten
thing
cowering
from
its
topmost
roof
to
the
bowed
back
of
its
stone
bridge
it
is
the
last
village
up
garthdale
a
handful
of
gray
houses
old
and
small
and
humble
the
high
road
casts
them
off
and
they
turn
their
backs
to
it
in
their
fear
and
huddle
together
humbly
down
by
the
beck
their
stone
roofs
and
walls
are
naked
and
blackened
by
wind
and
rain
as
if
fire
had
passed
over
them
they
have
the
silence
the
darkness
and
the
secrecy
of
all
ultimate
habitations
north
where
the
high
road
begins
to
rise
again
the
vicarage
stands
all
alone
it
turns
its
face
toward
the
village
old
and
gray
and
humble
as
any
house
there
and
looks
on
the
road
sideways
through
the
small
shy
window
of
its
gable
end
it
has
a
strip
of
garden
in
front
and
on
its
farther
side
and
a
strip
of
orchard
at
the
back
the
garden
slopes
down
to
the
churchyard
and
a
lane
leading
to
the
pastures
runs
between
and
all
these
things
of
stone
the
village
the
vicarage
the
church
the
churchyard
and
the
gravestones
of
the
dead
are
alike
naked
and
black
blackened
as
if
fire
had
passed
over
them
and
in
their
grayness
and
their
desolation
they
are
one
with
each
other
and
with
the
network
of
low
walls
that
links
them
to
the
last
solitary
farm
on
the
high
moor
and
on
the
breast
of
the
earth
they
show
one
moment
solid
as
if
hewn
out
of
her
heart
and
another
slender
and
as
a
tangle
of
gray
thread
on
her
green
gown
ii
through
four
of
its
five
front
windows
the
house
gave
back
darkness
to
the
dark
one
on
the
ground
floor
showed
a
golden
oblong
skirted
with
watery
gray
where
the
thinned
the
solid
blackness
of
the
wall
the
three
sisters
mary
gwendolen
and
alice
daughters
of
james
cartaret
the
vicar
of
garth
were
sitting
there
in
the
behind
the
yellow
blind
doing
nothing
in
their
supine
motionless
attitudes
they
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
something
to
happen
to
happen
so
soon
that
if
there
had
been
anything
to
do
it
was
not
worth
their
while
doing
it
all
three
were
alike
in
the
small
broad
faces
that
brooded
half
sullen
and
half
sad
in
the
wide
eyes
that
watched
vaguely
in
the
little
tender
noses
and
in
the
mouths
tender
and
sullen
too
in
the
arch
and
sweep
of
the
upper
lips
the
delicate
fulness
of
the
lower
in
the
way
of
the
thick
hair
parted
and
turned
back
over
the
brows
in
two
wide
and
shallow
waves
mary
the
eldest
sat
in
a
low
chair
by
the
fireside
her
hands
were
clasped
loosely
on
the
black
woolen
socks
she
had
ceased
to
darn
she
was
staring
into
the
fire
with
her
gray
eyes
the
thick
gray
eyes
that
never
let
you
know
what
she
was
thinking
the
firelight
woke
the
flame
in
her
hair
the
red
of
her
lips
was
turned
back
and
crushed
against
the
white
mary
was
shorter
than
her
sisters
but
she
was
the
one
that
had
the
color
and
with
it
she
had
a
stillness
that
was
not
theirs
mary
face
brooded
more
deeply
than
their
faces
but
it
was
untroubled
in
its
brooding
she
had
learned
to
darn
socks
for
her
own
amusement
on
her
eleventh
birthday
and
she
was
now
alice
the
youngest
girl
she
was
lay
stretched
out
on
the
sofa
she
departed
in
no
way
from
her
sister
type
but
that
her
body
was
slender
and
small
boned
that
her
face
was
lightly
finished
that
her
gray
eyes
were
clear
and
her
lips
pale
against
the
of
her
face
and
that
her
hair
was
colorless
as
dust
except
where
the
edge
of
the
wave
showed
a
dull
gold
alice
had
spent
the
whole
evening
lying
on
the
sofa
and
now
she
raised
her
arms
and
bent
them
pressing
the
backs
of
her
hands
against
her
eyes
and
now
she
lowered
them
and
lifted
one
sleeve
of
her
thin
blouse
and
turned
up
the
under
surface
of
her
arm
and
lay
staring
at
it
and
feeling
its
smooth
texture
with
her
fingers
gwendolen
the
second
sister
sat
leaning
over
the
table
with
her
arms
flung
out
on
it
as
they
had
tossed
from
her
the
book
she
had
been
reading
she
was
the
tallest
and
the
darkest
of
the
three
her
face
followed
the
type
obscurely
and
vividly
and
emphatically
it
left
it
there
was
dusk
in
her
and
dark
blue
in
the
gray
of
her
eyes
the
bridge
of
her
nose
and
the
arch
of
her
upper
lip
were
higher
lifted
as
it
were
in
a
decided
and
defiant
manner
of
their
own
about
gwenda
there
was
something
alert
and
impatient
her
very
supineness
was
alive
it
had
distinction
the
savage
grace
of
a
creature
utterly
abandoned
to
a
sane
fatigue
gwenda
had
gone
fifteen
miles
over
the
moors
that
evening
she
had
run
and
walked
and
run
again
in
the
riotous
energy
of
her
youth
now
she
was
too
tired
to
read
gwenda
was
the
first
to
speak
is
it
ten
yet
no
mary
smiled
but
the
word
shuddered
in
her
throat
like
a
weary
moan
how
long
minutes
oh
lord
gwenda
laughed
the
laugh
of
brave
nerves
tortured
from
her
sofa
beyond
the
table
alice
sighed
at
ten
essy
gale
the
would
come
in
from
the
kitchen
and
the
vicar
from
the
inner
room
and
essy
would
put
the
bible
and
on
the
table
and
the
vicar
would
read
prayers
that
was
all
they
were
waiting
for
it
was
all
that
could
happen
it
happened
every
night
at
ten
iii
alice
spoke
next
what
day
of
the
month
is
it
the
thirtieth
mary
answered
then
we
been
here
exactly
five
months
that
nothing
said
mary
to
the
months
and
years
we
shall
be
here
i
ca
think
what
possessed
papa
to
come
and
bury
us
all
in
this
rotten
place
ca
you
mary
eyes
turned
from
their
brooding
her
voice
was
very
quiet
barely
perceptible
the
significant
stress
oh
if
you
mean
it
he
wants
to
bury
you
need
rub
that
in
i
not
rubbing
it
in
you
are
you
rubbing
it
in
every
time
you
look
like
that
the
beastly
part
of
it
supposing
he
does
want
to
get
back
on
me
why
should
he
go
and
punish
you
two
if
he
thinks
he
punishing
me
he
sold
said
gwenda
he
could
have
stuck
you
in
a
rottener
hole
gwenda
raised
her
head
a
hole
why
there
no
end
to
it
you
can
go
for
miles
and
miles
without
meeting
anybody
unless
some
darling
mountain
sheep
gets
up
and
looks
at
you
it
it
a
divine
place
ally
wait
till
you
been
another
five
months
in
it
you
be
as
sick
as
i
am
i
do
think
so
you
have
seen
the
moon
get
up
over
greffington
edge
if
you
had
if
you
knew
what
this
place
was
like
you
lie
there
grizzling
you
would
talk
about
punishing
you
wonder
what
you
done
to
be
allowed
to
look
at
it
to
live
in
it
a
day
of
course
i
not
going
to
let
on
to
papa
that
i
in
love
with
it
mary
smiled
again
it
all
very
well
for
you
she
said
as
long
as
you
got
a
moor
to
walk
on
all
right
yes
i
all
right
gwenda
said
her
head
had
sunk
again
and
rested
in
the
hollow
of
her
arms
her
voice
muffled
in
her
sleeve
came
soft
and
thick
it
died
for
drowsiness
in
the
extreme
immobility
and
stillness
of
the
three
the
still
house
stirred
and
became
audible
to
them
as
if
it
breathed
they
heard
the
delicate
fall
of
the
ashes
on
the
hearth
and
the
flame
of
the
lamp
jerking
as
the
oil
sputtered
in
the
burnt
wick
their
nerves
shook
to
the
creeping
crackling
sounds
that
came
from
the
wainscot
infinitely
minute
a
tongue
of
fire
shot
hissing
from
the
coal
it
seemed
to
them
a
violent
and
terrifying
thing
the
breath
of
the
house
passed
over
them
in
thick
smells
of
earth
and
must
as
the
fire
heat
sucked
at
its
damp
the
church
clock
struck
the
half
hour
once
twice
two
dolorous
notes
that
beat
on
the
still
house
and
died
somewhere
out
at
the
back
a
door
opened
and
shut
and
it
was
as
if
the
house
drew
in
its
breath
at
the
shock
of
the
sound
presently
a
tremor
crept
through
gwenda
young
body
as
her
heart
shook
it
she
rose
and
went
to
the
window
iv
she
was
slow
and
rapt
in
her
going
like
one
walking
in
her
sleep
moved
by
some
impulse
profounder
than
her
sleep
she
pulled
up
the
blind
the
darkness
was
up
against
the
house
thick
and
close
to
the
pane
she
threw
open
the
window
and
the
night
entered
palpably
like
slow
water
black
and
sweet
and
cool
from
the
unseen
road
came
the
noise
of
wheels
and
of
a
horse
that
in
trotting
clanked
forever
one
shoe
against
another
it
was
young
rowcliffe
the
new
doctor
driving
over
from
morthe
to
upthorne
on
the
moor
where
john
greatorex
lay
dying
the
pale
light
of
his
lamps
swept
over
the
low
garden
wall
suddenly
the
four
hoofs
screamed
grinding
together
in
the
slide
of
their
halt
the
doctor
had
jerked
his
horse
up
by
the
vicarage
gate
the
door
at
the
back
opened
and
shut
again
suddenly
sharply
as
if
in
fear
a
voice
swung
out
like
a
mournful
bell
into
the
night
a
voice
such
a
voice
as
the
lonely
land
fashions
sometimes
for
its
own
delight
drawling
and
tender
hushed
by
the
hills
and
charged
with
the
infinite
mysterious
sadness
of
their
beauty
it
belonged
to
young
greatorex
and
it
came
from
the
doorway
of
the
vicarage
yard
that
yo
rawcliffe
i
wuss
joost
gawn
oop
t
see
ef
yo
wuss
coomin
of
course
i
was
coming
the
new
doctor
was
short
and
stern
with
young
greatorex
the
two
voices
the
soft
and
the
stern
spoke
together
for
a
moment
low
inaudible
then
young
greatorex
voice
was
heard
again
and
in
its
softness
there
was
the
furtive
note
of
shame
i
joost
looked
in
to
vicarage
to
leave
woord
with
paason
the
noise
of
the
wheels
and
hoofs
began
again
the
iron
shoes
clanked
together
and
struck
out
the
rhythm
that
the
sisters
knew
and
with
the
first
beat
of
it
and
with
the
sound
of
the
two
voices
in
the
road
life
secret
and
silent
stirred
in
their
blood
and
nerves
it
quivered
like
a
hunting
thing
held
on
the
leash
v
their
stillness
their
immobility
were
now
intense
and
not
one
spoke
a
word
to
the
other
all
three
of
them
were
thinking
mary
thought
wednesday
is
his
day
on
wednesday
i
will
go
into
the
village
and
see
all
my
sick
people
then
i
shall
see
him
and
he
will
see
me
he
will
see
that
i
am
kind
and
sweet
and
womanly
she
thought
that
is
the
sort
of
woman
that
a
man
wants
but
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
thinking
gwenda
thought
i
will
go
out
on
to
the
moor
again
i
do
care
if
i
late
for
prayers
he
will
see
me
when
he
drives
back
and
he
will
wonder
who
is
that
wild
strong
girl
who
walks
by
herself
on
the
moor
at
night
and
is
afraid
he
has
seen
me
three
times
and
every
time
he
has
looked
at
me
as
if
he
wondered
in
five
minutes
i
shall
go
she
thought
for
she
knew
what
she
was
thinking
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
i
do
care
whether
he
sees
me
or
not
i
do
care
if
i
never
see
him
again
i
do
care
alice
thought
i
will
make
myself
ill
so
ill
that
they
to
send
for
him
i
shall
see
him
that
way
vi
alice
sat
up
she
was
thinking
another
thought
if
greatorex
is
dead
rowcliffe
wo
stay
long
at
upthorne
he
will
come
back
soon
and
he
will
have
to
call
and
leave
word
he
will
come
in
and
i
shall
see
him
but
if
greatorex
was
dead
if
greatorex
were
a
long
time
over
his
dying
then
he
might
be
kept
at
upthorne
perhaps
till
midnight
perhaps
till
morning
then
even
if
he
called
to
leave
word
she
would
not
see
him
when
she
looked
deep
she
found
herself
wondering
how
long
greatorex
would
be
over
his
dying
if
she
had
looked
a
little
deeper
she
would
have
found
herself
hoping
that
greatorex
was
already
dead
if
greatorex
was
dead
before
he
got
to
upthorne
he
would
come
very
soon
perhaps
before
and
he
would
be
shown
into
the
would
he
would
essy
have
the
sense
no
not
unless
the
lamp
was
lit
there
essy
would
show
him
into
a
dark
room
and
essy
was
stupid
she
might
have
sense
she
might
take
him
straight
into
the
study
and
papa
would
keep
him
there
trust
papa
alice
got
up
from
her
sofa
and
left
the
room
moving
with
her
weary
grace
and
a
little
air
of
boredom
and
of
unconcern
she
was
always
most
unconcerned
when
she
was
most
intent
outside
in
the
passage
she
stood
a
moment
listening
all
the
ways
of
the
house
gave
upon
the
passage
in
a
space
so
narrow
that
by
stretching
out
one
arm
she
could
have
touched
both
walls
with
a
door
open
anywhere
the
passage
became
a
gully
for
the
north
wind
now
with
all
doors
shut
it
was
as
if
the
breath
of
the
house
was
being
squeezed
out
there
between
closing
walls
the
passage
instead
of
dividing
the
house
drew
it
together
tight
and
this
tightness
was
intolerable
to
alice
she
hated
it
she
hated
the
whole
house
it
was
so
built
that
there
was
a
corner
in
it
where
you
could
get
away
from
papa
his
study
had
one
door
opening
into
the
passage
and
one
into
the
the
window
where
he
sat
raked
the
garden
on
the
far
side
the
window
of
his
bedroom
raked
the
front
its
door
commanded
the
stairhead
he
was
aware
of
everything
you
did
of
everything
you
did
do
he
could
hear
you
in
the
he
could
hear
you
overhead
he
could
hear
you
going
up
and
downstairs
he
could
positively
hear
you
breathe
and
he
always
knew
whether
you
were
in
bed
or
not
she
drew
in
her
breath
lest
he
should
hear
it
now
at
the
far
end
of
the
passage
on
the
between
the
staircase
and
the
kitchen
door
raised
on
a
small
bracket
a
small
tin
lamp
showed
a
thrifty
flame
under
it
on
a
mahogany
was
a
row
of
bedroom
candlesticks
with
their
her
progress
to
the
was
stealthy
she
exalted
this
business
of
lighting
the
lamp
to
a
desperate
perilous
adventure
the
stone
floor
deadened
her
footsteps
as
she
went
her
pale
eyes
half
sullen
half
afraid
slewed
round
to
the
door
of
the
study
on
her
right
with
a
noiseless
hand
she
secured
her
matches
and
her
candle
with
noiseless
feet
she
slid
into
the
darkness
of
the
she
dared
not
light
her
candle
out
there
in
the
passage
for
the
vicar
was
full
of
gloom
and
of
suspicion
in
the
half
hour
before
and
at
the
spurt
of
the
match
he
might
come
out
blustering
and
insist
on
knowing
what
she
was
doing
and
where
she
was
going
whereas
presently
he
would
know
and
he
might
be
quiet
as
long
as
he
was
satisfied
that
she
was
shirking
prayers
stealthily
with
her
air
of
desperate
adventure
she
lit
the
lamp
she
shook
out
the
puffs
and
frills
of
its
yellow
paper
shade
under
its
gaudy
skirts
the
light
was
cruel
to
the
cramped
and
shabby
room
to
the
huddled
furniture
to
the
tarnished
gilt
the
perishing
tones
of
gray
and
amber
alice
set
the
lamp
on
the
top
of
the
cottage
piano
that
stood
slantwise
in
a
side
window
beyond
the
fireplace
she
had
pulled
back
the
muslin
curtains
and
opened
both
windows
wide
so
that
the
room
was
now
bared
to
the
south
and
west
then
with
the
abrupt
and
passionate
gesture
of
desire
deferred
she
sat
down
at
the
little
erard
and
began
to
play
sitting
there
with
the
open
window
behind
her
she
could
be
seen
and
she
knew
that
she
could
be
seen
from
over
the
wall
by
anybody
driving
past
in
a
high
and
she
played
she
played
the
chopin
grande
polonaise
or
as
much
of
it
as
her
fingers
tempestuous
and
inexpert
could
clutch
and
reach
she
played
neither
with
her
hands
nor
with
her
brain
but
with
her
temperament
febrile
and
frustrate
seeking
its
outlet
in
exultant
and
violent
sound
she
fell
upon
the
erard
like
some
fierce
and
hungry
thing
tearing
from
the
forlorn
humble
instrument
a
strange
and
savage
food
she
played
with
incredible
omissions
discords
and
distortions
but
she
played
she
flung
out
her
music
through
the
windows
into
the
night
as
a
signal
and
an
appeal
she
played
on
the
little
erard
in
ecstasy
and
expectation
as
if
something
momentous
hung
upon
her
playing
there
was
joy
and
triumph
and
splendor
in
the
grande
polonaise
she
felt
them
in
her
heart
and
nerves
as
a
delicate
dangerous
tremor
the
almost
intolerable
on
coming
of
splendor
of
triumph
and
of
joy
and
as
she
played
the
excitement
gathered
it
swung
in
more
and
more
vehement
vibrations
it
went
warm
and
flooding
through
her
brain
like
wine
all
the
life
of
her
bloodless
body
swam
there
poised
and
thinned
but
urgent
aspiring
to
some
great
climax
of
the
soul
vii
the
whole
house
was
full
of
the
chopin
grande
polonaise
it
raged
there
like
a
demon
tortured
out
of
all
knowledge
the
grande
polonaise
screamed
and
writhed
in
its
agony
it
writhed
through
the
windows
seeking
its
natural
attenuation
in
the
open
air
it
writhed
through
the
shut
house
and
was
beaten
back
pitilessly
by
the
roof
and
walls
to
let
it
loose
thus
was
alice
defiance
of
the
house
and
her
revenge
mary
and
gwenda
heard
it
in
the
and
set
their
mouths
and
braced
themselves
to
bear
it
the
vicar
in
his
study
behind
the
heard
it
and
scowled
essy
the
heard
it
she
heard
it
worse
than
anybody
in
her
kitchen
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
now
and
then
when
the
polonaise
screamed
louder
mary
drew
a
hissing
breath
of
pain
through
her
locked
teeth
and
gwenda
grinned
not
that
to
gwenda
there
was
anything
funny
in
the
writhing
and
screaming
of
the
grande
polonaise
it
was
that
she
alone
appreciated
its
vindictive
quality
she
admired
the
completeness
the
audacity
of
alice
revenge
but
essy
in
her
kitchen
made
no
effort
to
stand
up
to
the
grande
polonaise
when
it
began
she
sat
down
and
laid
her
arms
on
the
kitchen
table
and
her
head
muffled
in
her
apron
on
her
arms
and
cried
she
could
have
told
you
what
the
polonaise
was
like
or
what
it
did
to
her
all
that
she
could
have
said
was
that
it
went
through
and
through
her
she
did
know
essy
did
what
had
come
over
her
for
whatever
noise
miss
alice
made
she
had
taken
any
notice
not
at
first
it
was
in
the
last
three
weeks
that
the
polonaise
had
found
her
out
and
had
begun
to
go
through
and
through
her
till
it
was
more
than
she
could
bear
but
essy
crying
into
her
apron
would
have
lifted
a
finger
to
stop
miss
alice
poor
laass
essy
said
to
herself
she
looves
to
plaay
and
vicar
he
not
hold
out
mooch
longer
he
put
foot
down
fore
she
gets
trow
through
the
screaming
of
the
polonaise
essy
listened
for
the
opening
of
the
study
door
viii
the
study
door
did
not
open
all
at
once
wisdom
and
patience
wisdom
and
patience
the
vicar
kept
on
muttering
as
he
scowled
those
were
his
watchwords
in
his
dealings
with
his
womenkind
the
vicar
was
making
a
prodigious
effort
to
maintain
what
seemed
to
him
his
serenity
he
was
unaware
that
he
was
trying
to
control
at
one
and
the
same
time
his
temper
and
his
temperament
he
was
a
man
of
middle
height
and
squarish
build
dark
and
like
his
daughter
gwendolen
the
vicar
body
stretched
tight
the
seams
of
his
black
coat
and
kept
up
at
a
false
show
of
muscular
energy
the
vicar
face
had
a
subtle
quality
of
deception
the
austere
nose
the
lean
the
moustache
and
pointed
beard
black
slightly
grizzled
made
it
appear
at
a
little
distance
the
face
of
an
ascetic
it
approached
and
the
blue
of
the
eyes
and
the
black
of
their
dilated
pupils
the
stare
of
the
nostrils
and
the
half
hidden
lines
of
the
red
mouth
revealed
its
profound
and
secret
sensuality
the
interior
that
contained
him
was
no
less
deceptive
its
walls
advertised
him
as
the
scholarly
recluse
that
he
was
not
he
had
had
an
eye
to
this
effect
he
had
placed
in
prominent
positions
the
books
that
he
had
inherited
from
his
father
who
had
been
a
schoolmaster
you
were
caught
at
the
very
door
by
the
thick
red
line
of
the
tudor
classics
by
the
eleven
volumes
of
the
bekker
plato
with
notes
bound
in
russia
leather
side
by
side
with
translations
in
cloth
by
sophocles
and
dean
plumptre
the
odyssey
and
butcher
and
lang
by
æschylus
and
robert
browning
the
vicar
had
carried
the
illusion
of
scholarship
so
far
as
to
hide
his
aristophanes
behind
a
little
curtain
as
if
it
contained
for
him
an
iniquitous
temptation
of
his
own
accord
and
with
a
deliberate
intention
to
deceive
he
had
added
the
early
fathers
tillotsen
and
farrar
of
on
another
shelf
rather
less
conspicuous
were
some
bound
volumes
of
with
the
novels
of
henry
wood
and
miss
marie
corelli
on
the
ledge
of
his
bureau
uncut
lay
ready
to
his
hand
the
in
process
of
skimming
was
on
his
knees
the
fairly
gutted
was
on
the
floor
there
was
no
room
for
it
anywhere
else
for
the
vicar
study
was
much
too
small
for
him
sitting
there
in
an
and
with
his
legs
in
the
fender
he
looked
as
if
he
had
taken
flight
before
the
awful
invasion
of
his
furniture
his
bookcases
hemmed
him
in
on
three
sides
his
desk
advancing
on
him
from
the
window
had
driven
and
squeezed
him
into
the
his
bureau
armed
to
the
teeth
leaning
from
its
ambush
in
the
recess
of
the
fireplace
threatened
both
the
retreat
and
the
left
flank
movement
of
the
chair
the
vicar
was
neither
tall
nor
powerful
but
his
study
made
him
look
like
a
giant
imprisoned
in
a
cell
the
room
was
full
of
the
smell
of
tobacco
of
a
smoldering
coal
fire
of
old
warm
leather
and
damp
walls
and
of
the
heavy
virile
odor
of
the
vicar
a
brown
felt
carpet
and
thick
serge
curtains
shut
out
the
draft
of
the
northeast
window
on
a
september
evening
the
vicar
was
snug
enough
in
his
cell
and
before
the
grande
polonaise
had
burst
in
upon
him
he
had
been
at
peace
with
god
and
man
but
when
he
heard
those
first
exultant
challenging
bars
he
scowled
inimically
not
that
he
acknowledged
them
as
a
challenge
he
was
inclined
rather
to
the
manly
course
of
ignoring
the
grande
polonaise
altogether
and
not
for
a
moment
would
he
have
admitted
that
there
had
been
anything
in
his
behavior
that
could
be
challenged
or
defied
least
of
all
by
his
daughter
alice
to
himself
in
his
study
cartaret
appeared
as
the
image
of
righteousness
established
in
an
impregnable
place
whereas
his
daughter
alice
was
not
at
all
in
a
position
to
challenge
and
defy
she
had
made
a
fool
of
herself
she
knew
it
he
knew
it
everybody
knew
it
in
the
parish
they
had
left
five
months
ago
it
had
been
the
talk
of
the
little
southern
seaside
town
he
thanked
god
that
nobody
knew
it
or
was
ever
likely
to
know
it
here
for
alice
folly
was
not
any
ordinary
folly
it
was
the
kind
that
made
the
parish
which
was
so
aware
of
it
uninhabitable
to
a
sensitive
vicar
he
reflected
that
she
would
be
clever
if
she
made
a
fool
of
herself
here
by
his
decisive
action
in
removing
her
from
that
southern
seaside
town
he
had
saved
her
from
continuing
her
work
in
order
to
do
it
he
had
ruined
his
prospects
he
had
thrown
up
a
good
living
for
a
poor
one
a
living
that
might
but
for
alice
it
certainly
would
have
led
to
preferment
for
a
living
that
could
lead
to
nothing
at
all
a
living
where
he
could
make
himself
felt
for
a
living
where
there
was
nobody
to
feel
him
and
having
done
it
he
was
profoundly
sorry
for
himself
so
far
as
cartaret
could
see
there
had
been
nothing
else
to
do
if
it
had
all
to
be
done
over
again
he
told
himself
that
he
would
do
it
but
there
cartaret
was
wrong
he
could
have
done
it
or
anything
like
it
twice
it
was
one
of
those
deeds
supremeful
sacrificial
that
strain
a
man
moral
energies
to
breaking
point
and
render
him
incapable
of
further
sacrifice
if
indeed
it
did
not
render
further
sacrifice
superfluous
cartaret
honestly
felt
that
even
an
exacting
deity
could
require
no
more
of
him
and
it
was
the
first
time
either
nor
his
daughter
alice
the
first
woman
who
had
come
between
the
vicar
and
his
prospects
looking
back
he
saw
himself
driven
from
pillar
to
post
from
parish
to
parish
by
the
folly
or
incompetence
of
his
womankind
strictly
speaking
it
was
his
first
wife
mary
gwendolen
the
one
the
children
called
mother
who
had
begun
it
she
had
made
his
first
parish
unendurable
to
him
by
dying
in
it
this
she
had
done
when
alice
was
born
thereby
making
alice
unendurable
to
him
too
poor
mamie
he
always
thought
of
her
as
having
inscrutably
failed
him
all
three
of
them
had
failed
him
his
second
wife
frances
the
one
the
children
called
mamma
the
vicar
had
made
himself
believe
that
he
had
married
her
solely
on
their
account
had
turned
into
a
nervous
invalid
on
his
hands
before
she
died
of
that
obscure
internal
trouble
which
he
had
so
wisely
and
patiently
ignored
his
third
wife
robina
the
one
they
called
mummy
had
run
away
from
him
in
the
fifth
year
of
their
marriage
when
she
implored
him
to
divorce
her
he
said
that
whatever
her
conduct
had
been
that
course
was
impossible
to
him
as
a
churchman
as
she
well
knew
but
that
he
forgave
her
he
had
made
himself
believe
it
and
all
the
time
he
was
aware
without
admitting
it
that
if
the
thing
came
into
court
robina
evidence
might
be
a
little
damaging
to
the
appearances
of
wisdom
and
patience
of
austerity
and
dignity
which
he
had
preserved
so
well
he
had
had
an
unacknowledged
vision
of
robina
standing
in
the
witness
box
very
small
and
shy
with
her
eyes
fluttering
while
she
explained
to
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
that
she
ran
away
from
her
husband
because
she
was
afraid
of
him
he
could
hear
the
question
why
were
you
afraid
and
robina
answer
but
at
that
point
he
always
reminded
himself
that
it
was
as
a
churchman
that
he
objected
to
divorce
for
his
profession
had
committed
him
to
a
pose
he
had
posed
for
more
than
thirty
years
to
his
parish
to
his
three
wives
to
his
three
children
and
to
himself
till
he
had
become
unconscious
of
his
real
thoughts
his
real
motives
his
real
likings
and
dislikings
so
that
when
he
told
himself
that
it
would
have
been
better
if
his
third
wife
had
died
he
thought
he
meant
that
it
would
have
been
better
for
her
and
for
his
opinion
of
her
whereas
what
he
really
did
mean
was
that
it
would
have
been
better
for
himself
for
if
robina
had
died
he
could
have
married
again
as
it
was
her
infidelity
condemned
him
to
a
celibacy
for
which
as
she
knew
he
was
utterly
unsuited
therefore
he
thought
of
her
as
a
cruel
and
unscrupulous
woman
and
when
he
thought
of
her
he
became
more
sorry
for
himself
than
ever
now
oddly
enough
the
grande
polonaise
had
set
cartaret
thinking
of
robina
it
was
not
that
robina
had
ever
played
it
robina
did
not
play
it
was
not
the
discords
introduced
into
it
by
alice
though
robina
had
been
a
thing
of
discords
it
was
that
something
in
him
obscurely
but
intimately
associated
with
robina
responded
to
that
sensual
and
infernal
tremor
that
alice
was
wringing
out
of
the
polonaise
so
that
without
clearly
knowing
why
it
was
abominable
cartaret
said
to
himself
that
the
tune
alice
was
playing
was
an
abominable
tune
and
must
be
stopped
at
once
he
went
into
the
to
stop
it
and
essy
in
the
kitchen
raised
her
head
and
dried
her
eyes
on
her
apron
if
you
must
make
a
noise
said
cartaret
be
good
enough
to
make
one
that
is
less
disturbing
he
stood
in
the
doorway
staring
at
his
daughter
alice
her
excitement
had
missed
by
a
hairsbreadth
the
spiritual
climax
it
had
held
itself
in
for
one
unspeakable
moment
then
surged
crowding
the
courses
of
her
nerves
beaten
back
by
the
frenzy
of
the
polonaise
it
made
a
violent
return
it
rose
quivering
at
her
eyelids
and
her
mouth
it
broke
and
with
a
shudder
of
all
her
body
split
itself
and
fell
the
vicar
stared
he
opened
his
mouth
to
say
something
and
said
nothing
finally
he
went
out
muttering
wisdom
and
patience
wisdom
and
patience
it
was
a
prayer
alice
trailed
to
the
window
and
leaned
out
listening
for
the
sound
of
hoofs
and
wheels
nothing
there
but
the
darkness
and
stillness
of
the
moors
she
trailed
back
to
the
erard
and
began
to
play
again
this
time
it
was
beethoven
the
pathetic
sonata
ix
cartaret
sat
in
his
study
manfully
enduring
the
pathetic
sonata
he
was
no
musician
and
he
did
not
certainly
know
when
alice
went
wrong
therefore
except
that
it
had
some
nasty
loud
moments
he
could
not
honestly
say
that
the
first
movement
was
disturbing
besides
he
had
scored
he
had
made
alice
change
her
tune
wisdom
and
patience
required
that
he
should
be
satisfied
so
far
and
being
satisfied
in
the
sense
that
he
no
longer
had
a
grievance
meant
that
he
was
very
badly
bored
he
began
to
fidget
he
took
his
legs
out
of
the
fender
and
put
them
back
again
he
shifted
his
weight
from
one
leg
to
the
other
but
without
relief
he
turned
over
his
to
see
what
it
had
to
say
about
the
deceased
wife
sister
bill
and
found
that
he
was
not
interested
in
what
it
had
to
say
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
compared
it
with
the
clock
in
the
faint
hope
that
the
clock
might
be
behindhand
the
watch
and
clock
both
agreed
that
it
was
not
a
minute
later
than
fifteen
minutes
to
ten
a
whole
quarter
of
an
hour
before
there
was
nothing
but
to
look
forward
to
he
began
to
fidget
again
he
filled
his
pipe
and
thought
better
about
smoking
it
then
he
rang
the
bell
for
his
glass
of
water
after
more
delay
than
was
at
all
necessary
essy
appeared
bringing
the
glass
of
water
on
a
plate
she
came
in
almost
furtive
she
who
used
to
enter
so
suddenly
and
unabashed
she
put
the
plate
down
on
the
desk
and
turned
softly
furtively
away
the
vicar
looked
up
his
eyes
were
large
and
blue
as
suspicion
drew
in
the
black
of
their
pupils
put
it
down
here
he
said
and
he
indicated
the
ledge
of
the
bureau
essy
stood
still
and
stared
like
a
creature
in
doubt
as
to
its
way
she
decided
to
make
for
the
bureau
by
rounding
the
desk
on
the
far
side
thus
approaching
her
master
from
behind
what
are
you
doing
said
the
vicar
i
said
put
it
down
here
essy
turned
again
and
came
forward
tilting
the
plate
a
little
in
her
nervousness
the
large
blue
eyes
the
stern
voice
fascinated
her
frightened
her
the
vicar
looked
at
her
steadily
remorselessly
as
she
came
essy
lowered
eyelids
had
kept
the
stain
of
her
tears
her
thick
brown
hair
was
loose
and
rumpled
under
her
white
cap
but
she
had
put
on
a
clean
starched
apron
it
stood
out
stiffly
billowing
from
her
waist
essy
had
not
always
been
so
careless
about
her
hair
or
so
fastidious
as
to
her
aprons
there
was
a
little
strained
droop
at
the
corners
of
her
tender
mouth
as
if
they
had
been
tied
with
string
her
dark
eyes
still
kept
their
young
largeness
and
their
light
but
they
looked
as
if
they
had
been
drawn
tight
with
string
at
their
corners
too
all
these
signs
the
vicar
noted
as
he
stared
and
he
hated
essy
he
hated
her
for
what
he
saw
in
her
and
for
her
buxom
comeliness
and
for
the
softness
of
her
youth
did
i
hear
young
greatorex
round
at
the
back
door
this
evening
he
said
essy
started
slanting
her
plate
a
little
more
i
doan

knaw
sir
either
you
know
or
you

know
said
the
vicar
i
doan
know
i
sure
sir
said
essy
the
vicar
was
holding
out
his
hand
for
his
glass
of
water
and
essy
pushed
the
plate
toward
him
so
blindly
and
at
such
a
perilous
slant
that
the
glass
slid
and
toppled
over
and
broke
itself
against
the
vicar
chair
essy
gave
a
little
frightened
cry
clever
girl
she
did
that
on
purpose
said
the
vicar
to
himself
essy
was
on
her
knees
beside
him
picking
up
the
bits
of
glass
and
gathering
them
in
her
apron
she
was
murmuring
i
mop
it
oop
mop
it
oop
that
do
he
said
roughly
that
do
i
tell
you
you
can
go
essy
tried
to
go
but
it
was
as
if
her
knees
had
weights
on
them
that
fixed
her
to
the
floor
holding
up
her
apron
with
one
hand
she
clutched
the
arm
of
her
master
chair
with
the
other
and
dragged
herself
to
her
feet
i
mop
it
oop
she
repeated
shamefast
i
told
you
to
go
said
the
vicar
i
fetch
yo
anoother
glass
she
whispered
her
voice
was
hoarse
with
the
spasm
in
her
throat
no
said
the
vicar
essy
slunk
back
into
her
kitchen
with
terror
in
her
heart
x
attacca
subito
alice
had
fallen
on
it
suddenly
i
suppose
said
mary
it
a
relief
to
her
to
make
that
row
it
is
said
gwenda
it
torture
that
how
she
works
herself
up
she
playing
on
her
own
nerves
all
the
time
if
she
really
play
if
she
cared
about
the
music
if
she
cared
about
anything
on
earth
except
she
paused
molly
it
must
be
awful
to
be
made
like
that
nothing
could
be
worse
for
her
than
being
shut
up
here
i
know
papa
been
a
frightful
fool
about
her
after
all
molly
what
did
she
do
she
did
what
you
and
i
would
have
done
how
do
you
know
what
you
would
have
done
how
do
i
know
if
been
in
her
place
if
been
in
her
place
i
have
died
rather
how
do
you
know
ally
would
have
rather
died
if
she
could
have
chosen
she
did
want
to
fall
in
love
with
that
young
ass
rickards
and
i
do
see
what
she
did
that
was
so
very
awful
she
managed
to
let
everybody
else
see
anyhow
what
if
she
did
at
least
she
was
honest
she
went
straight
for
what
she
wanted
she
did
sneak
and
scheme
to
get
him
from
any
other
girl
and
she
had
a
mother
to
sneak
and
scheme
her
fifty
times
worse
yet
it
done
every
day
and
nobody
thinks
anything
of
it
she
went
on
nobody
would
have
thought
anything
as
it
was
if
papa
had
been
such
a
frantic
fool
about
it
it
he
had
the
pluck
to
stand
by
her
if
he
kept
his
head
and
laughed
in
their
silly
faces
instead
of
grizzling
and
growling
and
stampeding
out
of
the
parish
as
if
poor
ally
had
disgraced
him
well
it
is
a
very
pleasant
thing
for
the
vicar
of
the
parish
it
was
a
very
pleasant
thing
for
any
of
us
but
it
was
beastly
of
him
to
go
back
on
her
like
that
and
the
silliness
of
it
caring
so
frightfully
about
what
people
think
and
then
going
on
so
as
to
make
them
think
it
think
what
that
she
really
done
something
do
you
suppose
they
did
yes
you
ca
blame
them
he
could
have
piled
it
on
more
if
she
it
enough
to
make
her
oh
gwenda
it
would
be
his
own
fault
just
as
it
his
own
fault
that
he
hates
her
he
does
hate
her
he
fond
of
all
of
us
in
his
way
wot
of
ally
do
you
know
why
he
ca
look
at
her
without
thinking
of
how
awful
is
and
if
he
a
little
you
forget
what
he
had
to
go
through
you
mean
mummy
running
away
from
him
yes
and
mamma
dying
and
before
that
there
was
mother
gwenda
raised
her
head
he
killed
mother
what
do
you
mean
he
did
he
was
told
that
mother
would
die
or
go
mad
if
she
had
another
baby
and
he
let
her
have
ally
no
wonder
mummy
ran
away
from
him
who
told
you
that
story
mummy
it
was
horrid
of
her
everything
poor
mummy
did
was
horrid
it
was
horrid
of
her
to
run
away
from
him
i
suppose
why
did
you
tell
me
that
i
did
know
it
i
rather
not
have
known
well
now
you
do
know
perhaps
you
be
sorrier
for
ally
i
am
sorry
for
ally
but
i
sorry
for
papa
too
you
not
i
be
sorry
for
him
right
enough
if
he
was
so
sorry
for
himself
gwenda
awful
because
i
wo
waste
my
pity
ally
got
nothing
he
got
everything
not
what
he
cares
most
for
he
cares
most
for
what
people
think
of
him
everybody
thought
him
a
good
kind
husband
everybody
thinks
him
a
good
kind
father
the
music
suddenly
ceased
a
sound
of
voices
came
instead
of
it
there
said
gwenda
he
gone
in
and
stopped
her
he
had
that
time
and
in
the
sudden
ceasing
of
the
pathetic
sonata
the
three
sisters
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
and
the
clank
of
horseshoes
striking
together
greatorex
was
not
yet
dead
of
his
pneumonia
the
doctor
had
passed
the
vicarage
gate
and
as
he
passed
he
had
said
to
himself
how
execrably
she
plays
the
three
sisters
waited
without
a
word
for
the
striking
of
the
church
clock
xi
the
church
clock
struck
ten
at
the
sound
of
the
study
bell
essy
came
into
the
essy
was
the
acolyte
of
family
prayers
though
a
wesleyan
she
could
not
shirk
the
appointed
ceremonial
it
was
essy
who
took
the
bible
and
prayerbook
from
their
place
on
the
sideboard
under
the
and
put
them
on
the
table
opening
them
where
the
vicar
had
left
a
marker
the
night
before
it
was
essy
who
drew
back
the
vicar
chair
from
the
table
and
set
it
ready
for
him
it
was
essy
whom
he
relied
on
for
responses
that
responses
and
not
mere
mumblings
and
mutterings
she
was
wesleyan
the
one
faithful
the
one
devout
person
in
his
household
there
was
nothing
but
a
mumbling
and
a
muttering
and
that
was
mary
she
was
the
only
one
who
was
joining
in
the
lord
prayer
essy
had
failed
him
prayers
over
there
was
nothing
to
sit
up
for
all
the
same
it
was
cartaret
rule
to
go
back
into
the
study
and
to
bore
himself
again
for
a
whole
hour
till
it
was
he
liked
to
be
sure
that
the
doors
were
all
bolted
and
that
everybody
else
was
in
bed
before
he
went
himself
but
he
had
bored
himself
so
badly
that
the
thought
of
his
study
was
distasteful
to
him
so
he
stayed
where
he
was
with
his
family
he
believed
that
he
was
doing
this
solely
on
his
account
he
told
himself
that
it
was
not
right
that
he
should
leave
the
three
girls
too
much
to
themselves
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
as
long
as
he
had
had
a
wife
to
sit
with
he
had
cared
how
much
he
had
left
them
he
knew
that
he
had
rather
liked
mary
and
gwendolen
when
they
were
little
and
though
he
had
found
himself
liking
them
less
and
less
as
they
grew
into
their
teens
he
had
never
troubled
to
enquire
whose
fault
that
was
so
certain
was
he
that
it
could
be
his
still
less
was
it
his
fault
if
they
were
savage
and
inaccessible
in
their
twenties
of
course
he
did
mean
that
mary
was
savage
and
inaccessible
it
was
gwendolen
that
he
meant
so
since
he
could
sit
there
much
longer
without
saying
something
he
presently
addressed
himself
to
mary
any
news
of
greatorex
today
i
have
heard
shall
i
ask
essy
no
said
cartaret
so
abruptly
that

stopped
herself
essy
gale
was
in
the
room
three
months
ago
essy
had
been
a
servant
at
the
farm
where
her
mother
worked
once
a
fortnight
she
had
come
in
so
quietly
that
none
of
them
had
noticed
her
she
brought
a
tray
with
a
fresh
glass
of
water
for
the
vicar
and
a
glass
of
milk
for
alice
she
put
it
down
quietly
and
slipped
out
of
the
room
without
her
customary
anything
more
miss
and
what
the
matter
with
essy
gwenda
said
nobody
spoke
but
alice
who
was
saying
that
she
did
want
her
milk
more
than
a
year

had
been
ordered
milk
for
her
anæmia
she
had
milk
at
eleven
milk
at
her
midday
dinner
milk
for
supper
and
milk
last
thing
at
night
she
did
not
like
milk
but
she
liked
being
ordered
it
generally
she
would
sit
and
drink
it
in
the
face
of
her
family
pathetically
with
little
struggling
gulps
she
took
a
pleasure
in
her
anæmia
she
knew
that
it
made
her
sisters
sorry
for
her
and
that
it
annoyed
her
father
now
she
declared
that
she
was
feeling
well
and
that
she
want
her
milk
in
that
case
said
cartaret
you
had
better
go
to
bed
alice
went
raising
her
white
arms
and
rubbing
her
eyes
along
the
backs
of
her
hands
like
a
child
dropping
with
sleep
one
after
another
they
rose
and
followed
her
at
the
five
steep
steps
in
a
recess
of
the
wall
led
aside
to
the
door
of
essy
bedroom
there
gwenda
stopped
and
listened
a
sound
of
stifled
crying

from
the
room
gwenda
went
up
to
the
door
and
knocked

on
passing
her
father
door
at
the
stair
head
it
was
shut
she
could
hear
him
moving
heavily
within
the
room
on
the
other
side
of
the
landing
was
the
room
over
the
study
that
she
shared
with
alice
the
door
stood
wide
alice
in
her
thin
nightgown
could
be
seen
sitting
by
the
open
window
the
nightgown
the
small
slender
body
showing
through
the
hair
platted
for
the
night
in
two
that
hung
forward
one
over
each
small
breast
the
tired
face
between
the
parted
hair
made
alice
look
childlike
and
pathetic
gwendolen
had
a
pang
of
compassion
dear
lamb
she
said
is
any
good
fresh
air

alice

pneumonia

alice

tired
and
sullen
you

but
ally
had
set
her
small
face
hard

gwenda

be
sorry

all

she
had
sorrow

but
none
to
waste
on
essy
essy
way
was
easy
essy
had
only
to
slink
out
to
the
back
door
and
she
could
have
her
will
did
have
to
get
pneumonia
xii
john
greatorex
did
not
die
that
night
he
had
no
mind
to
die
he
was
a
man
of
stubborn
pugnacity
and
he
fought
his
pneumonia
the
long
gray
house
at
upthorne
looks
over
the
marshes
of
the
high
land
above
garth
it
stands
alone
cut
off
by
the
marshes
from
the
network
of
gray
walls
that
links
the
village
to
the
hill
farms
the
light
in
its
upper
window
burned
till
dawn
a
sign
to
the
brooding
and
solitary
land
up
there
in
the
low
room
with
its
sunken
ceiling
john
greatorex
lay
in
the
big
bed
and
rallied
a
little
as
the
clean
air
from
the
moors
lapped
him
like
water
for
the
doctor
had
thrown
open
all
the
windows
of
the
house
before
he
left
presently
gale
the
untrained
village
nurse
would
come
and
shut
them
in
terror
and
john
greatorex
pneumonia
would
get
the
upper
hand
that
was
how
the
fight
went
on
with
steven
rowcliffe
on
john
greatorex
side
and
gale
for
the
pneumonia
it
was
ten
to
one
against
john
greatorex
and
the
doctor
for
john
greatorex
was
most
of
the
time
unconscious
and
the
doctor
called
but
once
or
twice
a
day
while
gale
was
always
there
to
shut
the
windows
as
fast
as
he
opened
them
in
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
dale
there
was
another
woman
who
would
not
have
done
the
same
she
was
secure
from
criticism
if
she
did
know
how
to
nurse
pneumonia
who
did
seeing
that
her
own
husband
had
died
of
it
young
rowcliffe
was
a
dalesman
and
he
knew
his
people
in
six
months
his
face
had
grown
stiff
in
the
struggle
with
them
it
was
making
his
voice
stern
and
his
eyes
hard
so
that
they
could
see
nothing
round
him
but
stupidity
and
distrust
and
an
obstinacy
even
greater
than
his
own
nothing
in
his
previous
experience
had
prepared
him
for
it
in
his
big
provincial
hospital
he
had
had
it
practically
his
own
way
he
had
faced
a
thousand
horrible
and
intractable
diseases
with
a
thousand
appliances
and
with
an
army
of
assistants
and
trained
nurses
under
him
and
if
in
his
five
years
private
practice
in
leeds
he
had
come
to
grips
with
human
nature
it
had
been
at
any
rate
a
fair
fight
if
his
work
was
harder
his
responsibility
was
less
he
still
had
trained
nurses
under
him
and
if
a
case
was
beyond
him
there
were
specialists
with
whom
he
could
consult
here
he
was
he
was
physician
and
surgeon
and
specialist
and
nurse
in
one
he
had
few
appliances
and
no
assistant
beside
naked
and
primeval
nature
the
vast
high
spaces
the
clean
waters
and
clean
air
of
the
moors
yet
it
was
precisely
these
things
that
his
romantic
youth
had
cried
for
that
solitary
combat
and
communion
that
holy
and
solitary
aid
at
thirty
rowcliffe
was
still
in
his
romantic
youth
he
had
all
its
appearances
about
him
a
life
of
continual
labor
and
discomfort
had
kept
his
body
slender
and
all
the
edges
of
his
face
except
for
its
little
dark
moustache
were
incomparably
firm
and
clear
his
skin
was
bronzed
and
reddened
by
sun
and
wind
the
fine
hard
mouth
under
the
little
dark
moustache
was
not
so
hard
that
it
could
not
sometimes
be
tender
his
irreproachable
nose
escaped
the
too
high
curve
that
would
have
made
it
arrogant
and
his
eyes
keen
and
hard
in
movement
by
simply
keeping
quiet
under
lowered
brows
became
charged
with
a
curious
and
engaging
pathos
their
pathos
had
appealed
to
the
little
nurse
who
had
worked
under
him
in
leeds
she
was
clever
and
kind
much
too
kind
it
was
supposed
to
rowcliffe
there
had
been
one
or
two
others
before
the
little
nurse
so
that
though
he
was
growing
hard
he
had
not
grown
bitter
he
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
growing
bitter
for
he
knew
that
his
eyes
as
long
as
he
could
keep
them
quiet
would
preserve
him
from
all
necessity
for
bitterness
rowcliffe
had
always
trusted
a
great
deal
to
his
eyes
because
of
them
he
had
left
several
young
ladies
his
patients
quite
in
leeds
the
young
ladies
knew
nothing
about
the
little
nurse
and
had
never
ceased
to
wonder
why
rowcliffe
did
not
want
to
marry
them
and
steven
rowcliffe
eyes
so
disastrous
to
the
young
ladies
in
leeds
saw
nobody
in
morfe
whom
he
could
possibly
want
to
marry
the
village
of
morfe
is
built
in
a
square
round
its
green
the
house
stands
on
a
plot
of
rising
ground
on
the
north
side
of
the
square
and
from
its
front
windows
young
rowcliffe
could
see
the
inhabitants
of
morfe
coming
and
going
before
him
as
on
a
stage
and
he
kept
count
of
them
all
there
were
the
three
maiden
ladies
in
the
long
house
on
the
west
side
of
whom
all
he
knew
was
that
they
ate
far
too
many
pikelets
and
griddle
cakes
for
tea
there
were
the
two
old
ladies
in
the
white
house
next
door
who
were
always
worrying
him
to
sound
their
chests
one
for
her
lungs
and
the
other
for
her
arteries
in
spite
of
lungs
and
arteries
they
were
very
gay
old
ladies
the
tubes
of
rowcliffe
queer
stethescope
appearing
out
of
his
coat
pocket
sent
them
into
ecstacies
of
mirth
they
always
made
the
same
little
joke
about
it
they
called
the
stethescope
his
telephone
but
of
course
he
did
want
to
marry
them
there
was
the
very
old
lady
on
the
east
side
who
had
had
one
stroke
and
was
expecting
another
every
day
there
were
the
two
unmarried
daughters
of
a
retired
manufacturer
on
the
far
side
of
the
green
they
were
plump
and
had
red
cheeks
if
he
had
cared
for
plumpness
and
red
cheeks
but
they
had
no
conversation
the
only
pretty
girl
whose
prettiness
appealed
to
rowcliffe
had
an
adenoid
mouth
which
he
held
to
be
a
drawback
there
was
the
daughter
of
his
predecessor
but
she
again
was
well
over
forty
rigid
and
melancholy
and
dry
all
these
people
became
visibly
excited
when
they
saw
young
rowcliffe
starting
off
in
his
trap
and
returning
but
young
rowcliffe
was
never
excited
never
even
interested
when
he
saw
them
there
was
nothing
about
them
that
appealed
to
his
romantic
youth
as
for
morfe
manor
and
garth
manor
and
greffington
hall
they
were
nearly
always
empty
so
that
he
had
not
very
much
chance
of
improving
his
acquaintance
there
and
he
had
nothing
to
hope
for
from
the
summer
visitors
girls
with
queer
clothes
and
queer
manners
and
queer
accents
bouncing
convivial
girls
who
spread
themselves
four
abreast
on
the
high
roads
fat
lazy
girls
who
sat
about
on
the
green
blowsed
slouching
girls
who
tramped
the
dales
with
knapsacks
and
no
hats
the
hard
eyes
of
young
rowcliffe
never
softened
as
he
looked
at
the
summer
visitors
their
behavior
irritated
him
it
reminded
him
that
there
were
women
in
the
world
and
that
he
missed
quite
unbearably
at
moments
the
little
nurse
who
had
been
so
clever
and
so
kind
moreover
it
offended
his
romantic
youth
the
little
publicans
and
of
morfe
did
not
offend
it
neither
did
the
peasants
and
the
farmers
they
were
part
of
the
place
generations
of
them
had
been
born
in
those
gray
houses
built
from
the
gaunt
ribs
of
the
hills
whereas
the
presence
of
the
summer
visitors
was
an
outrage
to
the
silent
and
solitary
country
that
his
instincts
inscrutably
adored
no
wonder
that
he
did
care
to
look
at
them
but
one
night
in
september
when
the
moon
was
high
in
the
south
as
he
was
driving
toward
garth
on
his
way
to
upthorne
the
eyes
of
young
rowcliffe
were
startled
out
of
their
aversion
by
the
sudden
and
incredible
appearance
of
a
girl
it
was
at
the
bend
of
the
road
where
karva
lowers
its
head
and
sinks
back
on
the
moor
and
she
came
swinging
up
the
hill
as
horse
scraped
his
way
slowly
down
it
she
was
in
white
he
have
missed
her
and
she
carried
herself
like
a
huntress
slender
and
quick
with
high
breasts
she
looked
at
him
as
she
passed
and
her
face
was
and
luminous
under
the
moon
her
lips
were
parted
with
her
speed
so
that
instinctively
his
hands
tightened
on
the
reins
as
if
he
had
thought
that
she
was
going
to
speak
to
him
but
of
course
she
did
not
speak
he
looked
back
and
saw
her
swing
off
the
high
road
and
go
up
karva
a
flock
of
mountain
sheep
started
from
their
couches
on
the
heather
and
looked
at
her
and
she
went
driving
them
before
her
they
trailed
up
karva
slowly
in
a
long
line
gray
in
the
moonlight
their
mournful
musical
voices
came
to
him
from
the
hill
he
saw
her
again
late
incredibly
late
that
night
as
the
moon
swept
from
the
south
toward
karva
she
was
a
long
way
off
coming
down
from
her
hill
a
white
speck
on
the
gray
moor
he
pulled
up
his
horse
and
waited
below
the
point
where
the
track
she
followed
struck
the
high
road
he
even
got
out
of
his
trap
and
examined
deliberately
his
horse
hoofs
in
turn
spinning
out
the
time
when
he
heard
her
he
drew
himself
upright
and
looked
straight
at
her
as
she
passed
him
she
flashed
by
like
a
huntress
like
artemis
carrying
the
young
moon
on
her
forehead
from
the
turn
of
her
head
and
the
even
falling
of
her
feet
he
felt
her
unconscious
of
his
existence
and
her
unconsciousness
was
hateful
to
him
it
wiped
him
clean
out
of
the
universe
of
noticeable
things
the
apparition
fairly
cried
to
his
romantic
youth
and
he
said
to
himself
who
is
the
strange
girl
who
walks
on
the
moor
by
herself
at
night
and
is
afraid
he
saw
her
three
times
after
that
once
in
the
broad
daylight
on
the
high
road
near
morfe
when
she
passed
him
with
a
still
more
perfect
and
inimical
unconsciousness
once
in
the
distance
on
the
moor
when
he
caught
her
and
wild
jumping
the
wide
water
courses
as
they
came
evidently
under
the
impression
that
she
was
unobserved
and
he
smiled
and
said
to
himself
she
doing
it
for
fun
pure
fun
the
third
time
he
came
upon
her
at
dawn
with
the
dew
on
her
skirts
and
on
her
hair
she
darted
away
at
the
clank
of
his
horse
hoofs
divinely
shy
and
he
said
to
himself
that
time
getting
on
she
aware
of
me
all
right
she
had
come
down
from
karva
and
he
was
on
his
way
to
morfe
from
upthorne
he
had
sat
up
all
night
with
john
greatorex
who
had
died
at
dawn
the
smell
of
the
sick
man
and
of
the
bed
and
of
the
low
close
room
was
still
in
his
nostrils
and
in
his
ears
the
sounds
of
dying
and
of
mourning
and
at
his
heart
the
oppression
he
was
still
young
enough
to
feel
it
of
the
secret
and
abominable
things
he
knew
and
in
his
eyes
the
unknown
girl
and
her
behavior
became
suddenly
adorable
she
was
the
darting
joy
and
the
poignant
sweetness
and
the
sheer
extravagant
ardor
and
energy
of
life
his
tempestuously
romantic
youth
rose
up
and
was
troubled
at
the
sight
of
her
and
his
eyes
that
had
stared
at
her
in
wonder
and
amusement
and
inquisitive
interest
followed
her
now
with
that
queer
pathos
that
they
had
it
was
the
look
that
he
relied
on
to
move
desire
in
women
eyes
and
now
it
traveled
forlorn
and
ineffectual
abject
almost
in
its
futility
over
the
gray
moorgrass
where
she
went
that
was
on
wednesday
the
fourteenth
on
friday
the
sixteenth
he
saw
her
again
at
nightfall
in
the
doorway
of
john
greatorex
house
he
had
overtaken
the
cart
that
was
carrying
john
greatorex
coffin
to
upthorne
low
lighted
the
long
gray
house
brooded
over
the
marshes
waiting
to
be
disencumbered
of
its
dead
in
the
east
the
broken
shoulders
of
the
hills
receded
winding
with
the
dale
like
a
coast
line
of
gray
cliffs
above
the
mist
that
was
their
sea
tortured
mutilated
by
the
jagged
cloud
that
held
her
the
moon
struggled
and
tore
her
way
she
lifted
and
freed
herself
high
and
struck
the
marshes
white
defaced
and
sinister
above
her
battlements
she
looked
at
the
house
and
made
it
terrible
its
door
low
lighted
stood
open
to
the
night
rowcliffe
drew
back
from
the
threshold
to
let
a
woman
pass
out
looking
up
he
was
aware
that
he
had
seen
her
again
he
supposed
it
was
the
light
of
that
detestable
moon
that
gave
her
face
its
queer
morbid
whiteness
she
went
by
without
seeing
him
clenching
her
hands
and
carrying
her
young
head
high
and
he
saw
that
her
eyes
still
held
the
tears
that
she
was
afraid
to
spill
gale
stood
behind
her
with
a
lamp
lighting
her
passage
who
is
that
young
lady
he
asked
t
vicar
laass
gwanda
the
woman
leaned
to
him
and
whispered
she
seen
t
body
and
in
the
girl
fear
and
blindness
and
defiance
he
saw
the
pride
of
her
youth
beaten
and
offended
by
that
which
it
had
seen
out
there
in
the
bridle
path
leading
from
the
high
road
to
the
farm
the
cart
had
stopped
the
men
were
lifting
the
coffin
out
shouldering
it
carrying
it
along
he
saw
gwenda
cartaret
swerve
out
of
their
way
presently
he
heard
her
running
down
the
road
then
he
remembered
what
he
had
been
sent
for
he
turned
his
attention
to
gale
she
was
a
woman
of
or
so
who
had
once
been
comely
like
her
daughter
essy
now
her
soft
chin
had
sagged
in
her
cheeks
the
stagnant
blood
crawled
through
a
network
of
little
veins
and
the
gloss
had
gone
from
her
dark
hair
her
brown
eyes
showed
a
dull
defiance
and
deprecation
of
the
human
destiny
where
is

said

rowcliffe
went
up
xiii
in
the
low
lighted
room
the
thing
that
gwenda
cartaret
had
seen
lay
stretched
in
the
middle
of
the
great
bed
covered
with
a
sheet
the
bed
with
its
white
mound
was
so
much
too
big
for
the
four
walls
that
held
it
the
white
plaster
of
the
ceiling
bulging
above
it
stooped
so
low
that
the
body
of
john
greatorex
lay
as
if
already
closed
up
in
its
tomb
jim
greatorex
his
son
sat
on
a
wooden
chair
at
the
head
of
the
bed
his
young
handsome
face
was
loose
and
flushed
as
if
he
had
been
drinking
his
eyes
the
queer
blue
eyes
that
had
hitherto
looked
out
at
you
from
their
lodging
in
that
ruddy
sensuous
face
incongruously
spiritual
high
and
above
your
head
like
the
eyes
of
a
dreamer
and
a
mystic
jim
eyes
were
sunken
now
and
darkened
in
their
red
and
swollen
lids
they
stared
at
the
rug
laid
down
beside
the
bed
while
jim
mind
set
itself
to
count
stupidly
and
obstinately
the
snippets
of
gray
and
scarlet
cloth
that
made
the
pattern
on
the
black
every
now
and
then
he
would
recognise
a
snippet
as
belonging
to
some
suit
his
father
had
worn
years
ago
and
then
jim
brain
would
receive
a
shock
and
would
stagger
and
have
to
begin
its
counting
all
over
again
the
door
opened
to
let
rowcliffe
in
and
at
the
sound
of
the
door
as
if
a
spring
had
been
suddenly
released
in
his
spine
jim
greatorex
shot
up
and
started
to
his
feet
well
greatorex
good
evening
dr
rawcliffe
he
came
forward
awkwardly
hanging
his
head
as
if
detected
in
an
act
of
shame
there
was
a
silence
while
the
two
men
turned
their
backs
upon
the
bed
determined
to
ignore
what
was
on
it
they
stood
together
by
the
window
pretending
to
stare
at
things
out
there
in
the
night
and
so
they
became
aware
of
the
men
carrying
the
coffin
they
could
no
longer
ignore
it
wull
yo
look
at
doctor
better
not
rowcliffe
would
have
laid
his
hand
on
the
young
man
arm
muttering
a
refusal
but
greatorex
had
moved
to
the
bed
and
drawn
back
the
sheet
what
gwenda
cartaret
had
seen
was
revealed
the
dead
man
face
upturned
with
a
slight
tilt
to
the
ceiling
that
bulged
so
brutally
above
it
the
stiff
dark
beard
accentuating
the
tilt
the
eyes
also
upturned
white
under
their
unclosing
lids
the
nostrils
the
mouth
preserved
their
wonder
and
their
terror
before
a
thing
so
incredible
that
the
walls
and
roof
of
a
man
room
should
close
round
him
and
suffocate
him
on
this
horrified
face
there
were
the
marks
of
dissolution
and
at
the
corners
of
the
grim
beard
and
moustache
a
stain
it
left
nothing
to
be
said
it
was
the
face
of
the
man
who
had
drunk
hard
and
had
told
his
son
that
he
had
never
been
the
worse
for
drink
jim
greatorex
stood
and
looked
at
it
as
if
he
knew
what
rowcliffe
was
thinking
of
it
and
defied
him
to
think
rowcliffe
drew
up
the
sheet
and
covered
it
you
better
come
out
of
this
it
is
good
for
you
he
said
i
knaw
what
good
for
me
dr
rawcliffe
jim
stuck
his
hands
in
his
breeches
and
gazed
stubbornly
at
the
sheeted
mound
come
rowcliffe
said
do

way
like
this
buck

and
be
a
man
a

paused
listening
they
coom
he
said

down

out
into
the

followed
into
the
darkness
where
his
horse
and

the
sodden
straw
of
her
stall

the
mare
lay
heaving
and
snorting
after
her
agony
from
time
to
time
she
turned
her
head
toward
her
tense
and
swollen
flank
seeking
with
eyes
of
anguish
the
mysterious
source
of
pain

he
turned
to
the
window
ledge
by
the
stable
door
where
among
a
confusion
of
cobwebs
and
dusty
bottles
and
tin
cans
the
drench
of
turpentine
and
linseed
oil
the
little
phial
of
chlorodyne
and
the
clean
tin
pannikin
with
its
wide
protruding
mouth
stood

gleaming
in
the
lantern

gently
owd

rowcliffe
took
off
his
coat
and
shook
up
the
drench
and
poured
it
into
the
pannikin
while
greatorex
got
the
struggling
mare
on
to
her
feet
together
with
gentleness
and
dexterity
they
cajoled
her
then
jim
laid
his
hands
upon
her
mouth
and
opened
it
drawing
up
her
head
against
his
breast
willie
suddenly
competent
held
the
lantern
while
rowcliffe
poured
the
drench
down
her
throat
daisy
coughing
and
dribbling
stood
and
gazed
at
them
with
sad
and
terrified
eyes
and
while
the
undertaker
men
screwed
down
the
lid
upon
john
greatorex
in
his
coffin
jim
greatorex
his
son
watched
with
daisy
in
her
stall
and
steven
rowcliffe
watched
with
him
nursing
the
sick
mare
making
up
a
fresh
clean
bed
for
her
rubbing
and
fomenting
her
swollen
and
tortured
belly
when
daisy
rolled
in
another
agony
rowcliffe
gave
her
chlorodyne
and
waited
till
suddenly
she
lay
still
in
jim
face
as
he
looked
down
at
her
there
was
an
infinite
tenderness
and
pity
and
compunction
rowcliffe
wriggling
into
his
coat
regarded
him
with
curiosity
and
wonder
till
jim
drew
himself
up
and
fixed
him
with
his
queer
unhappy
eyes
shall
i
save
her
doctor
i
ca
tell
you
yet
i
better
send
the
vet
up
tomorrow
had
i
ay
jim
voice
was
strangled
in
the
spasm
of
his
throat
but
he
took
rowcliffe
hand
and
wrung
it
discharging
many
emotions
in
that
one
excruciating
grip
rowcliffe
pointed
to
the
little
phial
of
chlorodyne
lying
in
the
straw
if
i
were
you
he
said
i
should
leave
that
lying
about
through
his
long
last
night
in
the
gray
house
haunted
by
the
moon
john
greatorex
lay
alone
screwed
down
under
a
coffin
lid
and
his
son
jim
wrapped
in
a
and
with
his
head
on
a
hay
sack
lay
in
the
straw
of
the
stable
beside
daisy
his
mare
from
time
to
time
as
his
mood
took
him
he
turned
and
laid
his
hand
on
her
in
a
poignant
caress
as
if
she
had
been
his
or
his
bride
he
spoke
to
her
in
the
thick
soft
voice
of
passion
with
pitiful
broken
words
and
mutterings
what
is
it
daasy
what
is
it
there
did
they
then
did
they
my
beauty
my
lil
laass
i
i
wuss
a
domned
brute
to
forget
tha
a
domned
brute
all
that
night
and
the
next
night
he
lay
beside
her
the
funeral
passed
like
a
fantastic
interlude
between
the
long
acts
of
his
passion
his
great
sorrow
made
him
humble
to
gale
so
that
he
allowed
her
to
sustain
him
with
food
and
drink
and
on
the
third
day
it
was
known
throughout
garthdale
that
young
greatorex
who
had
lost
his
father
had
saved
his
mare
only
steven
rowcliffe
knew
that
the
mare
had
saved
young
greatorex
and
the
little
phial
of
chlorodyne
was
put
back
among
the
cobwebs
and
forgotten
xiv
down
at
the
vicarage
the
vicar
was
wrangling
with
his
youngest
daughter
for
the
third
time
alice
declared
that
she
was
not
well
and
that
she
did
want
her
milk
whether
you
want
it
or
not
you
got
to
drink
it
said
the
vicar
alice
took
the
glass
in
her
lap
and
looked
at
it
am
i
to
stand
over
you
till
you
drink
it
alice
put
the
rim
of
the
glass
to
her
mouth
and
shuddered
i
ca
she
said
it
make
me
sick
leave
the
poor
child
alone
papa
said
gwenda
but
the
vicar
ignored
gwenda
you
drink
it
if
i
stand
here
all
night
he
said
alice
struggled
with
a
spasm
in
her
throat
he
held
the
glass
for
her
while
she
groped
piteously
oh
where
my
hanky
with
superhuman
clemency
he
produced
his
own
it
serve
you
right
if
i
ill
said
alice
come
said
the
vicar
in
his
wisdom
and
his
patience
come
he
proffered
the
disgusting
cup
again
i
drink
it
and
have
done
with
it
if
i
were
you
said
mary
in
her
soft
voice
mary
soft
voice
was
too
much
for
alice
why
you
leave
me
alone
you
you
beast
mary
she
sobbed
and
cartaret
began
again
am
i
to
stand
here
alice
got
up
she
broke
loose
from
them
and
left
the
room
you
might
have
known
she
was
going
to
drink
it
gwenda
said
but
the
vicar
never
knew
when
he
was
beaten
she
would
have
drunk
it
he
said
if
mary
had
interfered
alice
had
not
got
the
pneumonia
that
had
killed
john
greatorex
such
happiness
she
reflected
was
not
for
her
she
had
desired
it
too
much
but
she
was
doing
very
well
with
her
anæmia
bloodless
and
slender
and
inert
she
dragged
herself
about
the
village
she
could
not
get
away
from
it
because
of
the
steep
hills
she
would
have
had
to
climb
a
small
unhappy
ghost
she
haunted
the
fields
in
the
bottom
and
the
path
along
the
beck
that
led
past
gale
cottage
the
sight
of
alice
was
more
than
ever
annoying
to
the
vicar
only
you
would
have
known
it
as
she
grew
whiter
and
weaker
he
braced
himself
and
became
more
hearty
and
robust
when
he
caught
her
lying
on
the
sofa
he
spoke
to
her
in
a
robust
and
hearty
tone
do
lie
there
all
day
my
girl
get
up
and
go
out
what
you
want
is
a
good
blow
on
the
moor
yes
if
i
did
die
before
i
got
there
alice
would
say
while
she
thought
serve
him
right
too
if
i
did
and
the
vicar
would
turn
from
her
in
disgust
he
knew
what
was
the
matter
with
his
daughter
alice
at
dinner
time
he
would
pull
himself
together
again
for
after
all
he
was
her
father
he
was
robust
and
hearty
over
the
sirloin
and
the
leg
of
mutton
he
would
call
for
a
glass
and
press
into
it
the
red
juice
of
the
meat
do
peak
and
pine
girl
drink
that
it
put
some
blood
into
you
and
alice
would
refuse
to
drink
it
next
she
refused
to
drink
her
milk
at
eleven
she
carried
it
out
to
essy
in
the
scullery
i
wish
you
drink
my
milk
for
me
essy
it
makes
me
sick
she
said
i
do
want
your
milk
said
essy
please
she
implored
her
but
essy
was
angry
her
face
flamed
and
she
banged
down
the
dishes
she
was
drying
i
sail
not
drink
it
what
should
i
want
your
milk
for
you
can
pour
it
in
t
pig
bucket
and
the
milk
would
be
left
by
the
scullery
window
till
it
turned
sour
and
essy
poured
it
into
the
pig
bucket
that
stood
under
the
sink
three
weeks
passed
and
with
every
week
alice
grew
more
bloodless
more
slender
and
more
inert
and
more
and
more
like
an
unhappy
ghost
her
small
face
was
smaller
there
was
a
tinge
of
green
in
its
and
of
mauve
in
the
dull
rose
of
her
mouth
and
under
her
shallow
breast
her
heart
seemed
to
rise
up
and
grow
large
while
the
rest
of
alice
shrank
and
grew
small
it
was
as
if
her
fragile
little
body
carried
an
enormous
engine
an
engine
of
infernal
and
terrifying
power
when
she
lay
down
and
when
she
got
up
and
with
every
sudden
movement
its
throbbing
shook
her
savagely
night
and
morning
she
called
to
her
sister
oh
gwenda
come
and
feel
my
heart
i
do
believe
it
growing
it
getting
too
big
for
my
body
it
frightens
me
when
it
jumps
about
like
that
it
frightened
gwenda
but
it
did
not
really
frighten
alice
she
rejoiced
in
it
rather
and
exulted
after
all
it
was
a
good
thing
that
she
had
not
got
pneumonia
which
might
have
killed
her
as
it
had
killed
john
greatorex
she
had
got
what
served
her
purpose
better
it
served
all
her
purposes
if
she
had
tried
she
could
not
have
hit
on
anything
that
would
have
annoyed
her
father
more
or
put
him
more
conspicuously
in
the
wrong
to
begin
with
it
was
his
doing
he
had
worried
her
into
it
and
he
had
brought
her
to
a
place
which
was
the
worst
place
conceivable
for
anybody
with
a
diseased
heart
since
you
could
stir
out
of
doors
without
going
up
hill
night
and
morning
alice
stood
before
the
and
turned
out
the
lining
of
her
lips
and
eyelids
and
saw
with
pleasure
the
pale
rose
growing
paler
every
other
hour
she
laid
her
hand
on
her
heart
and
took
again
the
full
thrill
of
its
dangerous
throbbing
or
felt
her
pulse
to
assure
herself
of
the
halt
the
jerk
the
hurrying
of
the
beat
night
and
morning
and
every
other
hour
she
thought
of
rowcliffe
if
it
goes
on
like
this
they
to
send
for
him
she
said
but
it
had
gone
on
the
three
weeks
had
passed
and
yet
they
had
not
sent
the
vicar
had
put
his
foot
down
he
would
have
the
doctor
he
knew
better
than
a
dozen
doctors
what
was
the
matter
with
his
daughter
alice
alice
said
nothing
she
simply
waited
as
if
some
profound
and
instinct
had
sustained
her
she
waited
sickening
and
on
the
last
night
of
the
third
week
she
fainted
she
had
dragged
herself
upstairs
to
bed
staggered
across
the
little
landing
and
fallen
on
the
threshold
of
her
room
they
kept
her
in
bed
next
day
at
one
she
refused
her
she
would
neither
eat
nor
drink
and
a
little
before
three
gwenda
went
for
the
doctor
she
had
not
told
alice
she
was
going
she
had
not
told
anybody
xv
she
had
to
walk
for
mary
had
taken
her
bicycle
nobody
knew
where
mary
had
gone
or
when
she
had
started
or
when
she
would
be
back
but
the
four
miles
between
garth
and
morfe
were
nothing
to
gwenda
who
would
walk
twenty
for
her
own
amusement
she
would
have
stretched
the
way
out
indefinitely
if
she
could
she
would
have
piled
garthdale
moor
on
greffington
edge
and
karva
on
the
top
of
them
and
put
them
between
garth
and
morfe
so
violent
was
her
fear
of
steven
rowcliffe
she
had
no
longer
any
desire
to
see
him
or
to
be
seen
by
him
he
had
seen
her
twice
too
often
and
too
early
and
too
late
after
being
caught
on
the
moor
at
dawn
it
was
preposterous
that
she
should
show
herself
in
the
doorway
of
upthorne
at
night
how
was
he
to
know
that
she
had
done
it
on
purpose
girls
did
these
things
poor
little
ally
had
done
them
and
it
was
because
ally
had
done
them
that
she
had
been
taken
and
hidden
away
here
where
she
could
do
them
any
more
but
could
she
gwenda
stood
still
staring
in
her
horror
as
the
frightful
thought
struck
her
that
ally
could
and
that
she
would
the
very
minute
she
realised
young
rowcliffe
and
he
would
think
not
that
it
mattered
in
the
least
what
he
thought
he
would
think
that
there
were
two
of
them
if
only
she
said
to
herself
if
only
young
rowcliffe
were
a
married
man
then
even
ally
could
not
that
she
blamed
poor
little
ally
she
looked
on
little
ally
as
the
victim
of
a
malign
and
tragic
tendency
the
fragile
vehicle
of
an
alien
and
overpowering
impulse
little
ally
was
doomed
it
was
her
fault
if
she
was
made
like
that
and
this
time
it
would
be
her
fault
at
all
their
father
would
have
driven
her
gwenda
hated
him
for
his
persecution
and
exposure
of
the
helpless
creature
she
walked
on
thinking
it
would
end
with
ally
they
were
all
three
exposed
and
persecuted
for
supposing
it
was
likely
but
supposing
that
this
rowcliffe
man
was
the
sort
of
man
she
liked
supposing
what
was
still
more
unlikely
that
he
was
the
sort
of
man
who
would
like
her
where
would
be
the
good
of
it
her
father
would
spoil
it
all
he
spoiled
everything
well
no
to
be
perfectly
accurate
not
everything
there
was
one
thing
he
had
not
spoiled
because
he
had
never
suspected
its
existence
her
singular
passion
for
the
place
of
course
if
he
had
suspected
it
he
would
have
stamped
on
it
it
was
his
business
to
stamp
on
other
people
passions
luckily
it
was
in
him
to
conceive
a
passion
for
a
place
it
had
come
upon
her
at
first
sight
as
they
drove
between
twilight
and
night
from
reyburn
through
rathdale
into
garthdale
it
was
when
they
had
left
the
wooded
land
behind
them
and
the
moors
lifted
up
their
naked
shoulders
one
after
another
darker
than
dark
into
a
sky
already
whitening
above
the
hidden
moon
and
she
saw
morfe
gray
as
iron
on
its
hill
bearing
the
square
crown
and
the
triple
pendants
of
its
lights
she
saw
the
long
straight
line
of
greffington
edge
hiding
the
secret
moon
and
karva
with
the
ashen
west
behind
it
there
was
something
in
their
form
and
in
their
gesture
that
called
to
her
as
if
they
knew
her
as
if
they
waited
for
her
they
struck
her
with
the
shock
of
recognition
as
if
she
had
known
them
and
had
waited
too
and
close
beside
her
own
wonder
and
excitement
she
had
felt
the
deep
and
sullen
repulsion
of
her
companions
the
vicar
sat
huddled
in
his
overcoat
his
nostrils
pinched
with
repugnance
sniffed
as
they
drank
in
the
cold
clean
air
from
time
to
time
he
shuddered
and
a
hoarse
muttering
came
from
under
the
gray
woolen
scarf
he
had
wound
round
his
mouth
and
beard
he
was
the
righteous
man
sent
into
uttermost
abominable
exile
for
his
daughter
sin
behind
him
on
the
back
seat
of
the
trap
alice
and
mary
cowed
under
their
capes
and
rugs
they
had
turned
their
shoulders
to
each
other
hostile
in
their
misery
gwenda
was
sorry
for
them
the
gray
road
dipped
and
turned
and
plunged
them
to
the
bottom
of
garthdale
the
small
scattering
lights
of
the
village
waited
for
her
in
the
hollow
with
something
humble
and
sad
and
familiar
in
their
setting
they
too
stung
her
with
that
poignant
and
secret
sense
of
recognition
this
is
the
place
the
vicar
had
said
he
had
addressed
himself
to
alice
and
it
had
been
as
if
he
had
said
this
the
place
the
infernal
the
damnable
place
you
brought
us
to
with
your
behavior
their
hatred
of
it
had
made
gwenda
love
it
you
can
have
your
old
garthdale
all
to
yourself
alice
had
said
nobody
else
wants
it
that
to
gwenda
was
the
charm
of
it
the
adorable
place
was
her
own
nobody
else
wanted
it
she
loved
it
for
itself
it
had
nothing
but
itself
to
offer
her
and
that
was
enough
it
was
almost
as
she
had
said
too
much
her
questing
youth
conceived
no
more
rapturous
adventure
than
to
follow
the
sheep
over
karva
to
set
out
at
twilight
and
see
the
immense
night
come
down
on
the
high
moors
above
upthorne
to
get
up
when
alice
was
asleep
and
slip
out
and
watch
the
dawn
turning
from
gray
to
rose
and
from
rose
to
gold
above
greffington
edge
as
it
happened
you
saw
sunrise
and
moonrise
best
from
the
platform
of
morfe
green
there
greffington
edge
breaks
and
falls
away
and
lets
slip
the
dawn
like
a
rosy
scarf
from
its
shoulder
and
sets
the
moon
free
of
her
earth
and
gives
her
to
the
open
sky
but
just
as
the
vicar
had
spoiled
rowcliffe
so
rowcliffe
had
spoiled
morfe
for
gwenda
therefore
her
fear
of
him
was
mingled
with
resentment
it
was
as
if
he
had
had
no
business
to
be
living
there
in
that
house
of
his
looking
over
the
green
incredible
that
she
should
have
wanted
to
see
and
to
know
this
person
but
now
that
she
did
want
to
of
course
she
was
going
to
see
him
at
the
bend
of
the
road
within
a
mile
of
morfe
mary
came
riding
on
gwenda
bicycle
large
parcels
were
slung
from
her
handle
bars
she
had
been
shopping
in
the
village
mary
bowed
forward
as
she
struggled
with
an
upward
slope
was
not
aware
of
gwenda
but
gwenda
was
aware
of
mary
and
not
being
in
the
mood
for
her
she
struck
off
the
road
on
to
the
moor
and
descended
upon
morfe
by
the
steep
lane
that
leads
from
karva
into
rathdale
it
never
occurred
to
her
to
wonder
what
mary
had
been
doing
in
morfe
so
evident
was
it
that
she
had
been
shopping
xvi
the
doctor
was
at
home
but
he
was
engaged
at
the
moment
in
the
surgery
the
asked
if
she
would
wait
she
waited
in
the
little
cold
and
formal
that
looked
through
two
windows
on
to
the
green
so
formal
and
so
cold
so
utterly
impersonal
was
the
air
of
the
doctor
mahogany
furniture
that
her
fear
left
her
it
was
as
if
the
furniture
assured
her
that
she
would
not
really
rowcliffe
as
for
knowing
him
she
need
worry
she
had
sent
in
her
card
printed
for
convenience
with
the
names
of
the
three
sisters
miss
cartaret
miss
gwendolen
cartaret
miss
alice
cartaret
she
felt
somehow
that
it
protected
her
she
said
to
herself
he
know
which
of
us
it
is
rowcliffe
was
washing
his
hands
in
the
surgery
when
the
card
was
brought
to
him
he
frowned
at
the
card
but
you
brought
this
before
he
said
i
seen
the
lady
no
sir
it
another
lady
another
are
you
certain
yes
sir
quite
certain
did
she
come
on
a
bicycle
no
sir
that
was
the
lady
you
seen
i
think
this
be
her
sister
rowcliffe
was
still
frowning
as
he
dried
his
hands
with
fastidious
care
she
different
sir
taller
like
taller
yes
sir
rowcliffe
turned
to
the
table
and
picked
up
a
probe
and
a
lancet
and
dropped
them
into
a
sterilising
solution
the
maid
waited
rowcliffe
absorption
was
complete
shall
i
ask
her
to
call
again
sir
no
i
see
her
where
is
she
in
the
sir
show
her
into
the
study
nothing
could
have
been
more
distant
and
reserved
than
but
to
a
young
woman
who
had
made
up
her
mind
that
she
did
want
to
know
anything
about
him
rowcliffe
study
said
too
much
it
told
her
that
he
was
a
ferocious
and
solitary
reader
for
in
the
long
rows
of
book
shelves
the
books
leaned
slantwise
across
the
gaps
where
his
hands
had
rummaged
and
ransacked
it
told
her
that
his
gods
were
masculine
and
many
darwin
and
spencer
and
haeckel
pasteur
curie
and
lord
lister
thomas
hardy
walt
whitman
and
bernard
shaw
their
photogravure
portraits
hung
above
the
bookcase
he
was
indifferent
to
mere
visible
luxury
or
how
could
he
have
endured
the
shabby
drugget
the
cheap
country
with
its
design
of
dreadful
roses
on
a
white
watered
ground
but
the
fire
in
the
grate
and
the
deep
drawn
close
to
it
showed
that
he
loved
warmth
and
comfort
that
his
tastes
made
him
solitary
she
gathered
from
the
chair
comparatively
unused
and
unworn
companion
lurking
and
sulking
in
the
corner
where
it
had
been
thrust
aside
the
one
window
of
this
room
looked
to
the
west
upon
a
little
orchard
gray
trunks
of
apple
trees
and
plum
trees
against
green
grass
green
branches
against
gray
stone
gray
that
was
softened
in
the
liquid
autumn
air
green
that
was
subtle
exquisite
charmingly
austere
he
could
see
his
little
orchard
as
he
sat
by
his
fire
she
thought
she
rather
liked
him
for
keeping
his
window
so
wide
open
she
was
standing
by
it
looking
at
the
orchard
as
he
came
in
he
was
so
quiet
in
his
coming
that
she
did
not
see
or
hear
him
till
he
stood
before
her
and
in
his
eyes
intensely
quiet
there
was
a
look
of
wonder
and
of
incredulity
almost
of
concern
greetings
and
introductions
over
the
unused
was
brought
out
from
its
lair
in
the
corner
rowcliffe
in
his
own
sat
in
shadow
facing
her
what
light
there
was
fell
full
on
her
i
sorry
you
should
have
had
to
come
to
me
he
said
your
sister
was
here
a
minute
or
two
ago
my
sister
i
think
it
have
been
your
sister
she
said
it
was
sister
i
was
to
go
and
see
i
did
know
she
was
coming
she
never
told
me
pity
i
was
coming
out
to
see
you
first
thing
tomorrow
morning
then
you
know
she
told
you
she
told
me
something
he
smiled
she
must
have
been
a
little
overanxious
you
do
look
as
if
there
was
very
much
the
matter
with
you
but
there
is
it
is
me
who
is
it
then
my
other
sister
oh
i
seem
to
have
got
a
little
mixed
you
see
there
are
three
of
us
he
laughed
three
let
me
get
it
right
i
seen
miss
cartaret
you
are
miss
gwendolen
cartaret
and
the
lady
i
am
to
see
is
my
youngest
sister
alice
now
i
understand
i
wondered
how
you
managed
those
four
miles
tell
me
about
her
she
began
she
was
vivid
and
terse
he
saw
that
she
made
short
cuts
to
the
root
of
the
matter
he
showed
himself
keen
and
shrewd
once
or
twice
he
said
i
know
i
know
and
she
checked
herself
my
sister
has
told
you
all
that
no
she
has
nothing
like
it
please
go
on
she
went
on
till
he
interrupted
her
how
old
is
she
just
i
see
yes
he
looked
so
keen
now
that
she
was
frightened
does
that
make
it
more
dangerous
she
said
he
laughed
no
it
makes
it
less
so
i
do
suppose
it
dangerous
at
all
but
i
ca
tell
till
i
seen
her
i
say
you
must
be
tired
after
that
long
walk
i
never
tired
that
good
he
rang
the
bell
the
maid
appeared
tell
acroyd
i
want
the
trap
and
bring
tea
at
once
for
two
sir
for
two
gwenda
rose
thanks
very
much
i
must
be
going
please
stay
it
wo
take
five
minutes
then
i
can
drive
you
back
i
can
walk
i
know
you
can
but
you
see
his
keenness
and
shrewdness
went
from
him
he
was
almost
embarrassed
i
going
round
to
see
your
sister
in
the
morning
but
i
think
i
rather
see
her
and
he
was
improvising
freely
now
i
ought
perhaps
to
see
you
after
as
you
understand
the
case
so
if
you
do
coming
back
with
me
she
did
mind
why
should
she
she
stayed
she
sat
in
rowcliffe
chair
before
his
fire
and
drank
his
tea
and
ate
his
hot
she
had
a
healthy
appetite
being
young
and
strong
she
talked
to
him
as
if
she
had
known
him
a
long
time
all
these
things
he
made
her
do
and
when
he
talked
to
her
he
made
her
forget
what
had
brought
her
there
he
made
her
forget
alice
and
mary
and
her
father
when
he
left
her
for
a
moment
she
got
up
restless
and
eager
to
be
gone
and
when
he
came
back
to
her
she
was
standing
by
the
open
window
again
looking
at
the
orchard
rowcliffe
looked
at
taking
in
her
tallness
her
slenderness
the
lithe
and
beautiful
line
of
her
body
curved
slightly
backward
as
she
leaned
against
the
window
wall
never
before
and
never
again
afterwards
never
that
was
to
say
for
any
other
woman
did
rowcliffe
feel
what
he
felt
then
looking
back
on
it
afterward
he
could
only
describe
it
as
a
sense
of
certainty
it
lacked
surprisingly
the
element
of
surprise
you
like
my
orchard
he
was
certain
that
she
did
she
turned
smiling
i
like
it
very
much
they
had
been
a
long
time
over
tea
it
was
five
before
they
started
he
brought
an
overcoat
and
put
it
on
her
he
wrapped
a
rug
round
her
knees
and
feet
and
tucked
it
well
in
you
do
like
rugs
he
said
he
knew
she
did
but
you
got
to
have
it
she
did
like
it
she
liked
his
rug
and
his
overcoat
and
his
little
brown
horse
with
the
clanking
hoofs
and
she
liked
him
most
decidedly
she
liked
him
too
he
was
the
sort
of
man
you
could
like
they
were
soon
out
on
the
moor
rowcliffe
youth
rose
in
him
and
put
words
into
his
mouth
ripping
country
this
she
said
it
was
ripping
for
the
life
of
them
they
could
have
said
more
about
it
there
were
no
words
for
the
inscrutable
ecstasy
it
gave
them
as
they
passed
karva
rowcliffe
smiled
it
all
right
he
said
my
driving
you
of
course
you
remember
but
we
met
several
times
before
where
i
show
you
where
anyhow
that
your
hill
is
it
how
did
you
know
it
was
because
i
seen
you
there
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
you
no
was
a
bit
farther
on
at
the
bend
of
the
road
we
coming
to
it
they
came
just
here
he
said
and
now
they
were
in
sight
of
garthdale
funny
i
should
have
thought
it
was
you
who
were
i
never
you
wo
be
as
long
as
you
can
walk
like
that
and
run
and
jump
a
horrid
pause
you
did
it
very
nicely
another
pause
not
quite
so
horrid
and
then
do
you
walk
after
dark
and
before
sunrise
and
it
was
as
if
he
had
said
why
am
i
always
meeting
you
what
do
you
do
it
for
it
queer
is
it
but
he
had
given
her
her
chance
she
rose
to
it
i
done
it
ever
since
we
came
here
it
was
as
if
she
had
said
long
before
came
i
do
it
because
i
like
it
that
the
best
of
this
place
you
can
do
what
you
like
in
it
there
nobody
to
see
you
counting
me
he
thought
as
nobody
i
should
like
to
do
it
too
he
said
to
go
out
before
sunrise
if
i
had
got
to
if
i
did
it
for
fun
like
you
he
knew
he
would
not
really
have
liked
it
but
his
romantic
youth
persuaded
him
in
that
moment
that

xvii
mary
was
up
in
the
attic
the
west
attic
that
looked
on
to
the
road
through
its
shy
gable
window
she
moved
quietly
there
her
whole
being
suffused
exquisitely
with
a
sense
of
peace
of
profound
indwelling
goodness
every
act
of
hers
for
the
last
three
days
had
been
incomparably
good
had
been
indeed
perfect
she
had
waited
on
alice
hand
and
foot
she
had
made
the
chicken
broth
refused
by
alice
there
was
nothing
that
she
would
not
do
for
poor
little
ally
when
little
ally
was
petulant
and
sullen
mary
was
gentle
and
serene
she
felt
toward
little
ally
lying
there
so
little
and
so
white
a
poignant
yearning
tenderness
today
she
had
visited
all
the
sick
people
in
the
village
though
it
was
not
wednesday
rowcliffe
day
only
by
visiting
them
on
other
days
could
mary
justify
and
make
blameless
her
habit
of
visiting
them
on
wednesdays
she
had
put
the
house
in
order
she
had
done
her
shopping
in
morfe
to
such
good
purpose
that
she
had
concealed
even
from
herself
the
fact
that
she
had
gone
into
morfe
surreptitiously
to
fetch
the
doctor
of
course
mary
was
aware
that
she
had
fetched
him
she
had
been
driven
to
that
step
by
sheer
terror
all
the
way
home
she
kept
on
saying
to
herself
i
saved
ally
i
saved
ally
that
thought
splendid
and
exciting
rushed
to
the
lighted
front
of
mary
mind
if
the
thought
of
rowcliffe
followed
its
shining
trail
it
thrust
him
back
it
spread
its
luminous
wings
to
hide
him
it
substituted
its
heavenly
form
for
his
so
effectually
did
it
cover
him
that
mary
herself
never
dreamed
that
he
was
there
neither
did
the
vicar
when
he
saw
her
arrive
laden
with
parcels
wholesomely
cheerful
and
reddened
by
her
ride
he
had
said
to
her
you
a
good
girl
mary
and
the
sadness
of
his
tone
implied
that
he
wished
her
sister
gwendolen
and
her
sister
alice
were
more
like
her
and
he
had
smiled
at
her
under
his
austere
moustache
and
carried
in
the
biggest
parcels
for
her
the
vicar
was
pleased
with
his
daughter
mary
mary
had
never
given
him
an
hour
anxiety
mary
had
never
put
him
in
the
wrong
never
made
him
feel
uncomfortable
he
honestly
believed
that
he
was
fond
of
her
she
was
like
her
poor
mother
goodness
he
said
to
himself
was
in
her
face
there
had
been
goodness
in
mary
face
when
she
went
into
alice
room
to
see
what
she
could
do
for
her
there
was
goodness
in
it
now
up
in
the
attic
where
there
was
nobody
but
god
to
see
it
goodness
at
peace
with
itself
and
utterly
content
she
had
been
back
more
than
an
hour
and
ever
since
teatime
she
had
been
up
in
the
attic
putting
away
her
summer
gowns
she
shook
them
and
held
them
out
and
looked
at
them
the
poor
pretty
things
that
she
had
hardly
ever
worn
they
hung
all
limp
all
abashed
and
broken
in
her
hands
as
if
aware
of
their
futility
she
said
to
herself
they
were
no
good
no
good
at
all
and
next
year
they
all
be
i
shall
be
ashamed
to
be
seen
in
them
and
she
folded
them
and
laid
them
by
for
their
winter
rest
in
the
black
trunk
and
when
she
saw
them
lying
there
she
had
a
moment
of
remorse
after
all
they
had
been
part
of
herself
part
of
her
throbbing
sensuous
womanhood
warmed
once
by
her
body
it
was
their
fault
poor
things
any
more
than
hers
if
they
had
been
futile
and
unfit
she
shut
the
lid
down
on
them
gently
and
it
was
as
if
she
buried
them
gently
out
of
her
sight
she
could
afford
to
forgive
them
for
she
knew
that
there
was
no
futility
nor
unfitness
in
her
deep
down
in
her
heart
she
knew
it
she
sat
on
the
trunk
in
the
attitude
of
one
waiting
waiting
in
the
utter
stillness
of
assurance
she
could
afford
to
wait
all
her
being
was
still
all
its
secret
impulses
appeased
by
the
slow
and
orderly
movements
of
her
hands
suddenly
she
started
up
and
listened
she
heard
out
on
the
road
the
sound
of
wheels
and
of
hoofs
that
struck
together
and
she
frowned
she
thought
he
might
as
well
have
called
today
if
he
passing
the
clanking
ceased
the
wheels
slowed
down
and
mary
peaceful
heart
moved
violently
in
her
breast
the
trap
drew
up
at
the
vicarage
gate
she
went
over
to
the
window
the
small
shy
gable
window
that
looked
on
to
the
road
she
saw
her
sister
standing
in
the
trap
and
rowcliffe
beneath
her
standing
in
the
road
and
holding
out
his
hand
she
saw
the
two
faces
the
man
face
looking
up
the
woman
face
looking
down
both
smiling
and
mary
heart
drew
itself
together
in
her
breast
through
her
shut
lips
her
sister
name
forced
itself
almost
audibly
suddenly
she
shivered
a
cold
wind
blew
through
the
open
window
yet
she
did
not
move
to
shut
it
out
to
have
interfered
with
the
attic
window
would
have
been
a
breach
of
compact
an
unholy
invasion
of
her
sister
rights
for
the
attic
the
smallest
the
coldest
the
darkest
and
most
thoroughly
uncomfortable
room
in
the
whole
house
was
gwenda
made
over
to
her
in
the
vicar
magnanimity
by
way
of
compensation
for
the
necessity
that
forced
her
to
share
her
room
with
alice
as
the
attic
was
used
for
storing
trunks
and
lumber
only
two
square
yards
of
floor
could
be
spared
for
gwenda
but
the
two
square
yards
cleared
and
covered
with
a
strip
of
old
carpet
and
furnished
with
a
little
table
and
one
chair
the
by
the
window
with
its
hanging
bookcase
the
window
itself
and
the
corner
fireplace
near
it
were
hers
beyond
division
and
dispute
nobody
wanted
them
and
as
mary
from
among
the
boxes
looked
toward
her
sister
territory
her
small
brooding
face
took
on
such
sadness
as
good
women
feel
in
contemplating
a
character
inscrutable
and
unlike
their
own
mary
was
sorry
for
gwenda
because
of
her
inscrutability
and
unlikeness
then
thinking
of
gwenda
mary
smiled
the
smile
began
in
pity
for
her
sister
and
ended
in
a
nameless
secret
satisfaction
not
for
a
moment
did
mary
suspect
its
source
it
seemed
to
her
one
with
her
sense
of
her
own
goodness
when
she
smiled
it
was
as
if
the
spirit
of
her
small
brooding
face
took
wings
and
fluttered
lifting
delicately
the
rather
heavy
corners
of
her
mouth
and
eyes
then
quietly
and
with
no
indecorous
haste
she
went
down
into
the
to
receive
rowcliffe
she
was
the
eldest
and
it
was
her
duty
by
the
mercy
of
heaven
the
vicar
had
gone
out
gwenda
left
rowcliffe
with
mary
and
went
upstairs
to
prepare
alice
for
his
visit
she
had
brushed
out
her
sister
long
pale
hair
and
platted
it
and
had
arranged
the
plats
tied
with
knots
of
white
ribbon
one
over
each
low
breast
and
she
had
helped
her
to
put
on
a
little
white
flannel
jacket
with
a
broad
lace
collar
thus
arrayed
and
decorated
alice
sat
up
in
her
bed
her
small
slender
body
supported
by
huge
pillows
white
against
white
with
no
color
about
her
but
the
dull
gold
of
her
hair
gwenda
was
still
in
the
room
tidying
it
when
mary
brought
rowcliffe
there
it
was
a
rowcliffe
whom
she
had
not
yet
seen
she
had
her
back
to
him
as
he
paused
in
the
doorway
to
let
mary
pass
through
ally
bed
faced
the
door
and
the
look
in
ally
eyes
made
her
aware
of
the
change
in
him
all
of
a
sudden
he
had
become
taller
much
taller
than
he
really
was
and
rigid
and
austere
his
youth
and
its
charm
dropped
clean
away
from
him
he
looked
ten
years
older
than
he
had
been
ten
minutes
ago
compared
with
him
as
he
stood
beside
her
bed
ally
looked
more
than
ever
like
a
small
child
a
child
vibrating
with
shyness
and
fear
a
child
that
implacable
adult
authority
has
found
out
in
foolishness
and
naughtiness
so
evident
was
it
to
ally
that
to
rowcliffe
nothing
was
hidden
nothing
veiled
it
was
as
a
child
that
he
treated
her
a
child
who
can
conceal
nothing
from
whom
most
things
all
the
serious
and
important
things
must
be
concealed
and
ally
knew
the
terrible
advantage
that
he
took
of
her
it
was
bad
enough
when
he
asked
her
questions
and
took
no
more
notice
of
her
answers
than
if
she
had
been
a
born
fool
that
might
have
been
his
manners
and
probably
he
could
help
them
but
there
was
no
necessity
that
ally
could
see
for
his
brutal
abruptness
and
the
callous
and
repellent
look
he
had
when
she
bared
her
breast
to
the
stethescope
that
sent
all
her
poor
secrets
flying
through
the
long
tubes
that
attached
her
heart
to
his
abominable
ears
neither
when
he
had
disentangled
himself
from
the
stethescope
could
she
understand
why
he
should
scowl
appallingly
as
he
took
hold
of
her
poor
wrist
to
feel
her
pulse
she
said
to
herself
he
knows
everything
about
me
and
he
thinks
awful
it
was
anguish
to
ally
that
he
should
think
her
awful
and
to
make
it
worse
if
anything
could
make
it
there
was
mary
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
staring
at
her
mary
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
was
thinking
how
awful
she
was
it
was
what
mary
thought
herself
if
only
gwenda
had
stayed
with
her
but
gwenda
had
left
the
room
when
she
saw
rowcliffe
take
out
his
stethescope
and
as
it
flashed
on
ally
what
rowcliffe
was
thinking
of
her
her
heart
stopped
as
if
it
was
never
going
on
again
then
staggered
then
gave
a
terrifying
jump
rowcliffe
had
done
with
ally
little
wrist
he
laid
it
down
on
the
counterpane
not
brutally
at
all
but
gently
almost
tenderly
as
if
it
had
been
a
thing
exquisitely
fragile
and
precious
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
looked
at
her
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
as
he
looked
rowcliffe
became
young
again
charmingly
young
almost
boyish
and
as
if
faintly
amused
at
her
youth
faintly
touched
by
her
fragility
he
smiled
with
a
mouth
and
with
eyes
from
which
all
austerity
had
departed
he
smiled
at
alice
it
was
all
over
he
had
done
with
her
he
could
afford
to
be
kind
to
her
as
he
would
have
been
kind
to
a
little
frightened
child
and
alice
smiled
back
at
him
with
her
white
face
between
the
pale
gold
serious
bands
of
platted
hair
she
was
no
longer
frightened
she
forgot
his
austerity
as
if
it
had
never
been
she
saw
that
he
had
thought
her
awful
in
the
least
he
could
have
looked
at
her
like
that
if
he
had
a
sense
of
warmth
of
stillness
of
soft
happiness
flooded
her
body
and
her
brain
as
if
the
stream
of
life
had
ceased
troubling
and
ran
with
an
even
rhythm
as
she
lay
back
her
tormented
heart
seemed
suddenly
to
sink
into
it
and
rest
to
be
part
of
it
poised
on
the
stream
then
still
looking
down
at
her
he
spoke
it
pretty
evident
he
said
what
the
matter
with
you
it
her
eyes
were
all
wide
he
had
frightened
her
again
it
is
he
said
you
been
starved
oh
said
little
ally
is
all
and
rowcliffe
smiled
again
a
little
differently
mary
said
nothing
she
had
found
out
long
ago
that
silence
was
her
strength
her
small
face
brooded
impossible
to
tell
what
she
was
thinking
what
has
become
of
the
other
one
i
wonder
he
said
to
himself
he
wanted
to
see
her
she
was
the
intelligent
one
of
the
three
sisters
and
she
was
honest
he
had
said
to
her
quite
plainly
that
he
would
want
her
why
on
earth
he
wondered
had
she
gone
away
and
left
him
with
this
sweet
and
good
this
quite
exasperatingly
sweet
and
good
woman
who
had
told
him
nothing
but
lies
he
was
aware
that
mary
cartaret
was
sweet
and
good
but
he
had
found
that
sweet
and
good
women
were
not
invariably
intelligent
as
for
honesty
if
they
were
always
honest
they
would
not
always
be
sweet
and
good
through
the
door
he
opened
for
the
eldest
sister
to
pass
out
the
other
slipped
in
she
had
been
waiting
on
the
landing
he
stopped
her
he
made
a
sign
to
her
to
come
out
with
him
he
closed
the
door
behind
them
can
i
see
you
for
two
minutes
yes
they
whispered
rapidly
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
mary
waited
he
turned
his
smile
acknowledged
and
paid
deference
to
her
sweetness
and
goodness
for
rowcliffe
was
sufficiently
accomplished
but
not
more
so
than
mary
cartaret
her
face
wide
and
candid
quivered
with
subdued
interrogation
her
lips
parted
as
if
they
said
i
am
only
waiting
to
know
what
i
am
to
do
i
will
do
what
you
like
only
tell
me
rowcliffe
stood
by
the
bedroom
door
which
he
had
opened
for
her
to
pass
through
again
his
eyes
summoning
their
powerful
pathos
implored
forgiveness
mary
utterly
submissive
passed
through
he
followed
gwendolen
cartaret
downstairs
to
the
he
knew
what
he
was
going
to
say
but
what
he
did
say
was
unexpected
for
as
she
stood
there
in
the
small
and
old
and
shabby
room
what
struck
him
was
her
youth
is
your
father
in
he
said
he
surprised
her
as
he
had
surprised
himself
no
she
said
why
do
you
want
to
see
him
he
hesitated
i
almost
think
i
better
he
wo
be
a
bit
of
good
you
know
he
never
is
he
does
even
know
we
sent
for
you
well
then
you
better
tell
me
straight
out
you
have
to
in
the
end
is
it
serious
no
but
it
will
be
if
we
do
stop
it
how
long
has
it
been
going
on
ever
since
we
came
to
this
place
six
months
you
said
and
she
been
worse
than
this
last
month
much
worse
if
it
was
only
the
anæmia
is
it
yes
among
other
things
not
her
heart
no
her
heart
all
right
he
corrected
himself
i
mean
no
disease
in
it
you
see
she
ought
to
have
got
well
up
here
in
this
air
it
the
sort
of
place
you
send
anæmic
people
to
to
cure
them
the
dreadful
thing
is
that
she
does
like
the
place
ah
that
what
i
want
to
get
at
she
is
happy
in
it
no
she
is
happy
he
meditated
your
sister
did
tell
me
that
she
could
i
mean
your
other
sister
miss
cartaret
would
she
think
it
rather
awful
he
laughed
heaps
of
people
think
it
awful
to
tell
the
truth
do
you
happen
to
know
she
does
like
the
place
she
was
silent
evidently
there
was
some
awfulness
she
shrank
from
too
lonely
for
her
i
suppose
much
too
lonely
where
were
you
before
you
came
here
she
told
him
why
did
you
leave
it
she
hesitated
again
we
could
help
it
well
it
seems
a
pity
but
i
suppose
clergymen
ca
choose
where
they
live
she
looked
away
from
him
then
as
if
she
were
trying
to
divert
her
from
the
trail
he
followed
you
forget
she
been
starving
herself
is
that
enough
not
in
her
case
you
see
she
is
ill
because
she
been
starving
herself
she
been
starving
herself
because
she
ill
it
a
symptom
the
trouble
is
not
that
she
starves
herself
but
that
been
starved
i
know
i
know
if
you
could
get
her
back
to
that
place
where
she
was
happy
i
ca
she
can
never
go
back
there
besides
it
would
be
any
good
if
she
did
he
smiled
are
you
quite
sure
certain
does
she
know
it
no
she
never
knew
it
but
she
know
it
if
she
went
back
that
why
you
took
her
away
she
hesitated
again
yes
rowcliffe
looked
grave
i
see
that
rather
unfortunate
he
said
to
himself
she
does
take
it
in
i
do
see
how
to
tell
her
to
her
he
said
well
i
send
the
medicine
along
as
the
door
closed
behind
rowcliffe
mary
appeared
on
the
stairs
gwenda
she
said
ally
wants
you
she
wants
to
know
what
he
said
he
said
nothing
you
look
as
if
he
said
a
great
deal
he
said
nothing
that
she
does
know
he
told
her
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
her
except
that
been
starving
herself
he
told
me
she
been
starved
i
do
see
the
difference
well
said
gwenda
did
that
night
the
vicar
scowled
over
his
supper
and
before
it
was
ended
he
broke
loose
which
of
you
two
sent
for
dr
rowcliffe
i
did
said
gwenda
mary
said
nothing
and
what
do
you
mean
by
doing
such
a
thing
without
consulting
me
i
mean
said
gwenda
quietly
that
he
should
see
alice
and
meant
most
particularly
that
he
should
see
her
if
wanted
him
to
see
her
i
have
gone
for
him
myself
when
it
was
a
bit
too
late
said
gwenda
his
blue
eyes
dilated
as
he
looked
at
her
do
you
suppose
i
do
know
what
the
matter
with
her
as
well
as
he
does
as
he
spoke
the
stiff
straight
moustache
that
guarded
his
mouth
lifted
showing
the
sensual
redness
and
fulness
of
the
lips
and
of
this
expression
on
her
father
face
gwenda
understood
nothing
divined
nothing
knew
nothing
but
that
she
loathed
it
you
may
know
what
the
matter
with
her
she
said
but
can
you
cure
it
can
he
said
the
vicar
xviii
the
next
day
which
was
a
tuesday
alice
was
up
and
about
again
rowcliffe
saw
her
on
wednesday
and
on
saturday
when
he
declared
himself
satisfied
with
her
progress
and
a
little
surprised
so
surprised
was
he
that
he
said
he
would
not
come
again
unless
he
was
sent
for
and
then
in
three
days
alice
slid
back
but
they
were
not
to
worry
about
her
she
said
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
her
except
that
she
was
tired
she
was
so
tired
that
she
lay
all
tuesday
on
the
sofa
and
on
wednesday
morning
she
was
too
tired
to
get
up
and
dress
and
on
wednesday
afternoon
rowcliffe
found
a
note
waiting
at
the
blacksmith
cottage
in
garth
village
where
he
had
a
room
with
a
brown
gauze
blind
in
the
window
and
the
legend
in
gilt
letters
surgery
rowcliffe
hours
of
attendance
wednesday
the
note
ran
dear
rowcliffe
can
you
come
and
see
me
this
afternoon
i
think
i
rather
worse
but
i
do
want
to
frighten
my
people
so
perhaps
if
you
just
looked
in
about
teatime
as
if
you
called
yours
truly
alice
cartaret
essy
gale
had
left
the
note
that
morning
rowcliffe
looked
at
it
dubiously
he
was
honest
and
he
had
the
large
views
of
a
man
used
to
a
large
practice
his
patients
complain
that
he
lengthened
his
bills
by
paying
unnecessary
visits
if
he
wanted
to
add
to
his
income
in
that
way
he
was
going
to
begin
with
a
poor
parson
hysterical
daughter
but
as
the
vicar
of
garth
had
called
on
him
and
left
his
card
on
monday
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
look
in
on
wednesday
about
teatime
especially
as
he
knew
that
the
vicar
was
in
the
habit
of
visiting
upthorne
and
the
outlying
portions
of
his
parish
on
wednesday
afternoons
all
day
alice
lay
in
her
little
bed
like
a
happy
child
and
waited
propped
on
her
pillows
with
her
slender
arms
stretched
out
before
her
on
the
counterpane
she
waited
her
sullenness
was
gone
she
had
nothing
but
sweetness
for
mary
and
for
essy
even
to
her
father
she
was
sweet
she
could
afford
it
her
instinct
was
now
sure
from
time
to
time
a
smile
flickered
on
her
small
face
like
a
light
almost
of
triumph
the
vicar
and
miss
cartaret
were
out
when
rowcliffe
called
at
the
vicarage
but
miss
gwendolen
was
in
if
he
would
like
to
see
her
he
waited
in
the
crowded
shabby
gray
and
amber
with
the
erard
in
the
corner
and
it
was
there
that
she
came
to
him
he
said
he
had
only
called
to
ask
after
her
sister
as
he
had
heard
in
the
village
that
she
was
not
so
well
i
afraid
she
is
may
i
see
her
i
do
mean
professionally
just
for
a
talk
the
formula
came
easily
he
had
used
it
hundreds
of
times
in
the
houses
of
parsons
and
of
clerks
and
of
little
shopkeepers
to
whom
bills
were
nightmares
she
took
him
upstairs
on
the
landing
she
turned
to
him
she
does
worse
she
looks
better
all
right
she
wo
deceive
me
she
did
look
better
better
than
he
could
have
believed
there
was
a
faint
opaline
dawn
of
color
in
her
face
heaven
only
knew
what
he
talked
about
but
he
talked
for
over
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
kept
it
up
and
when
he
rose
to
go
he
said
you
not
worse
you
better
you
be
perfectly
well
if
you
only
get
up
and
go
out
why
waste
all
this
glorious
air
if
i
could
live
on
air
said
alice
you
can
you
do
to
a
very
large
extent
you
certainly
ca
live
without
it
downstairs
he
lingered
but
he
refused
the
tea
that
gwenda
offered
him
he
said
he
had
time
patients
were
waiting
for
him
but
i
look
in
next
wednesday
if
i
may
at
teatime
very
well
at
teatime
how
alice
said
the
vicar
when
he
returned
from
upthorne
she
better
has
that
fellow
rowcliffe
been
here
again
he
called
on
you
i
think
rowcliffe
cards
lay
on
the
table
flap
in
the
passage
proving
plainly
that
his
visit
was
not
professional
and
you
made
him
see
her
he
insisted
he
saw
her
well
he
says
she
all
right
she
be
well
if
only
she
go
out
in
the
open
air
it
what
i
been
dinning
into
her
for
the
last
three
months
she
does
want
a
doctor
to
tell
her
that
he
drew
her
into
the
study
and
closed
the
door
he
was
not
angry
he
had
more
than
ever
his
air
of
wisdom
and
of
patience
look
here
gwenda
he
said
gravely
i
know
what
i
doing
nothing
in
the
world
the
matter
with
her
but
she
never
be
well
as
long
as
you
keep
on
sending
for
young
rowcliffe
but
his
daughter
gwendolen
was
not
impressed
she
knew
what
it
meant
that
air
of
wisdom
and
of
patience
her
unsubmissive
silence
roused
his
temper
i
wo
have
him
sent
for
do
you
hear
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
go
over
to
morfe
again
and
give
young
rowcliffe
a
hint
it
was
to
give
him
a
hint
that
he
had
called
on
monday
but
the
vicar
did
not
call
again
in
morfe
for
before
he
could
brace
himself
to
the
effort
alice
was
well
again
though
the
vicar
did
not
know
it
rowcliffe
had
looked
in
at
teatime
the
next
wednesday
and
the
next
after
that
alice
was
no
longer
compelled
to
be
ill
in
order
to
see
him

well
but
it
a
wonderful
voice
said
gwenda
cartaret
i
never
heard
another
like
it
and
i
know
something
about
voices
alice
said
they
had
gone
up
to
upthorne
to
ask
gale
to
look
in
at
the
vicarage
on
her
way
home
for
essy
was
very
well
but
gale
had
shied
off
from
the
subject
of
essy
she
had
done
it
with
the
laughter
of
deep
wisdom
and
a
shake
of
her
head
you
teach
gale
anything
about
illness
nor
about
essy
i
knaw
assy
she
had
said
there
nowt
amiss
with
her
doa
you
woorry
and
then
jim
greatorex
though
unseen
had
burst
out
at
them
with
his
big
voice
it
came
booming
from
the
mistal
at
the
back
alice
told
the
truth
when
she
said
she
had
never
heard
anything
like
it
and
even
in
the
dale
so
critical
of
strangers
it
was
admitted
that
she
knew
the
village
had
a
new
schoolmaster
who
was
no
musician
and
hopeless
with
the
choir
alice
as
the
musical
one
of
the
family
had
been
trained
to
play
the
organ
and
she
played
it
not
with
passion
for
it
was
her
duty
but
with
mechanical
and
perfunctory
correctness
as
she
had
been
taught
she
was
also
fairly
successful
with
the
village
choir
mebbe
yo
anoother
said
gale
it
rackoned
there

barytone
voice

you
think

alice
said
it
for
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
asking
she
knew
nothing
of
the
story
of
jim
greatorex
and
his
big
voice
it
had
been
carefully
kept
from
her
i
doan

why

he
leave
it
gale
looked
dark
and
tightened
up
her
face
she
knew
perfectly
well
why
jim
greatorex
had
left
it
was
because
he
was
going
to
have
that
little
lass
learning
to
sing
his
pride
would
stomach
it
but
not
for
worlds
would
gale
have
been
the
one
to
let
miss
alice
know
that
her
eyes
sought
for
inspiration
in
a
crack
on
the
stone
floor

ripping
for

concert
xx
but
the
concert
was
not
till
the
first
week
in
december
and
it
was
in
november
that
rowcliffe
began
to
form
the
habit
that
made
him
remarkable
in
garth
of
looking
in
at
the
vicarage
toward
teatime
every
wednesday
afternoon
gale
informed
by
essy
was
the
first
to
condole
with
blenkiron
the
blacksmith
wife
who
had
arranged
to
provide
tea
for
rowcliffe
every

in
the

blenkiron

gale
for

who

her
was
not
subtle
but
of
ally
happiness
there
could
be
no
doubt
it
lapped
her
soaked
into
her
like
water
and
air
her
small
head
flowered
under
it
and
put
out
its
secret
colors
the
dull
gold
of
her
hair
began
to
shine
again
her
face
showed
a
shallow
flush
under
its
pallor
her
gray
eyes
were
clear
as
if
they
had
been
dipped
in
water
two
slender
golden
arches
shone
above
them
they
had
been
seen
there
for
five
years
who
would
have
believed
said
mary
that
ally
could
have
looked
so
pretty
ally
prettiness
when
she
gazed
at
it
in
the
glass
was
delicious
intoxicating
joy
to
ally
she
was
never
tired
of
looking
at
it
of
turning
round
and
round
to
get
new
views
of
it
of
dressing
her
hair
in
new
ways
to
set
it
off
whatever
have
you
done
your
hair
like
that
for
said
mary
on
a
wednesday
when
ally
came
down
in
the
afternoon
with
her
gold
spread
out
above
her
ears
and
twisted
in
a
shining
coil
on
the
top
of
her
head
to
make
it
grow
better
said
ally
do
let
papa
catch
you
at
it
said
gwenda
if
you
want
it
to
grow
any
more
gwenda
was
going
out
she
had
her
hat
on
and
was
taking
her
from
the
stand
ally
stared
you
going
out
i
am
said
gwenda
and
she
laughed
as
she
went
she
was
going
to
stay
at
home
for
rowcliffe
every
wednesday
as
for
ally
the
vicar
did
catch
her
at
it
he
caught
her
the
very
next
wednesday
afternoon
she
thought
he
had
started
for
upthorne
when
he
had
he
was
bound
to
catch
her
for
the
best
in
the
house
was
in
the
vicar
bedroom
it
went
the
whole
length
and
width
of
the
wardrobe
door
and
ally
could
see
herself
in
it
from
head
to
foot
and
on
the
vicar
there
lay
a
large
and
perfect
that
had
belonged
to
mother
only
by
opening
the
wardrobe
door
and
with
the
aid
of
the
could
ally
obtain
a
satisfactory
view
of
her
face
and
figure
now
by
the
vicar
magnanimity
his
daughters
were
allowed
to
use
his
bedroom
twice
in
every
two
years
in
the
spring
and
in
the
autumn
for
the
purpose
of
trying
on
their
new
gowns
but
this
year
they
were
wearing
out
last
winter
gowns
and
ally
had
no
business
in
the
vicar
bedroom
at
four
in
the
afternoon
she
was
turning
slowly
round
and
round
with
her
head
tilted
back
over
her
left
shoulder
she
had
just
caught
sight
of
her
little
white
nose
as
it
appeared
in
a
vanishing
profile
and
was
adjusting
her
head
at
another
and
still
more
interesting
angle
when
the
vicar
caught
her
he
was
well
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
staring
at
her
before
she
was
aware
of
him
the
wardrobe
door
flung
wide
open
had
concealed
his
entrance
but
if
ally
had
not
been
blinded
and
intoxicated
with
her
own
beauty
she
would
have
seen
him
before
she
began
smiling
first
then
then
sideways
a
little
tilted
then
she
shut
to
the
door
of
the
wardrobe
for
the
back
view
that
was
to
reassure
her
as
to
the
utter
prettiness
of
her
shoulders
and
the
nape
of
her
neck
and
it
was
at
that
moment
that
she
saw
him
reflected
behind
her
in
the
long
she
screamed
and
dropped
the
she
heard
it
break
itself
at
her
feet
papa
she
cried
how
you
frightened
me
it
was
not
so
much
that
he
had
caught
her
smiling
at
her
own
face
it
was
that
face
seen
in
the
was
awful
and
besides
being
awful
it
was
evil
even
to
ally
innocence
it
was
evil
if
it
had
been
any
other
man
ally
instinct
would
have
said
that
he
looked
horrid
without
ally
knowing
or
caring
to
know
what
her
instinct
meant
but
the
look
on
her
father
face
was
awful
because
it
was
mysterious
neither
she
nor
her
instinct
had
a
word
for
it
there
was
cruelty
in
it
and
besides
cruelty
some
quality
nameless
and
unrecognisable
subtle
and
secret
and
yet
crude
somehow
and
vivid
the
horror
of
it
made
her
forget
that
he
had
caught
her
in
one
of
the
most
deplorably
humiliating
situations
in
which
a
young
girl
can
be
caught
deliberately
manufacturing
smiles
for
her
own
amusement
you
no
business
to
be
here
said
the
vicar
he
picked
up
the
broken
and
as
he
looked
at
it
the
cruelty
and
the
nameless
quality
passed
out
of
his
face
as
if
a
hand
had
smoothed
it
and
it
became
suddenly
weak
and
pathetic
the
face
of
a
child
whose
precious
magic
thing
another
child
has
played
with
and
broken
then
alice
remembered
that
the
had
been
her
mother
i
sorry
i
broken
it
papa
if
you
liked
it
her
voice
recalled
him
to
himself
ally
he
said
what
am
i
to
think
of
you
are
you
a
fool
or
what
the
sting
of
it
lashed
ally
brain
to
a
retort
all
that
she
had
needed
hitherto
to
be
effective
was
a
little
red
blood
in
her
veins
and
she
had
got
it
now
i
be
a
fool
she
said
if
i
cared
two
straws
what
you
think
of
me
since
you
ca
see
what
i
am
i
sorry
if
i
broken
your
old
though
i
did
break
it
you
broke
it
yourself
carrying
her
golden
like
a
crown
she
left
the
room
the
vicar
took
the
broken
and
hid
it
in
a
drawer
he
was
sorry
for
himself
the
only
impression
left
on
his
mind
was
that
his
daughter
ally
had
been
cruel
to
him
but
ally
did
care
a
rap
what
he
thought
of
her
or
what
impression
she
had
left
on
his
mind
she
was
much
too
happy
besides
if
you
once
began
caring
what
papa
thought
there
would
be
no
peace
for
anybody
he
was
so
impossible
that
he
did
count
he
was
even
an
effective
serpent
in
her
paradise
he
might
crawl
all
over
it
as
indeed
he
did
crawl
but
he
left
no
trail
the
thought
of
how
he
had
caught
her
at
the
might
be
disagreeable
but
it
could
slime
those
holy
lawns
neither
could
it
break
the
ecstasy
of
wednesday
that
heavenly
day
nothing
could
break
it
as
long
as
rowcliffe
continued
to
look
in
at
and
her
father
to
explore
the
furthest
borders
of
his
parish
the
peace
of
paradise
came
down
on
the
vicarage
every
wednesday
the
very
minute
the
garden
gate
had
swung
back
behind
the
vicar
he
started
so
early
and
he
was
back
so
late
that
there
was
never
any
chance
of
his
encountering
young
rowcliffe
to
be
sure
young
rowcliffe
hardly
ever
said
a
word
to
her
he
always
talked
to
mary
or
to
gwenda
but
there
was
nothing
in
his
reticence
to
disturb
ally
ecstasy
it
was
bliss
to
sit
and
look
at
rowcliffe
and
to
hear
him
talk
when
she
tried
to
talk
to
him
herself
her
brain
swam
and
she
became
unhappy
and
confused
intellectual
effort
was
destructive
to
the
blessed
state
which
was
pure
passivity
untroubled
contemplation
in
its
early
stages
before
the
oncoming
of
rapture
the
fact
that
mary
and
gwenda
could
talk
to
him
and
talk
intelligently
showed
how
little
they
cared
for
him
or
were
likely
to
care
and
how
immeasurably
far
they
were
from
the
supreme
act
of
adoration
similarly
the
fact
that
rowcliffe
could
talk
to
mary
and
to
gwenda
showed
how
little
cared
if
he
had
cared
if
he
were
ever
going
to
care
as
ally
understood
caring
his
brain
would
have
swum
like
hers
and
his
intellect
would
have
abandoned
him
whereas
it
was
when
he
turned
to
ally
that
he
had
a
word
to
say
any
more
than
she
had
and
that
he
became
entangled
in
his
talk
and
that
the
intellect
he
tried
to
summon
to
him
tottered
and
vanished
at
his
call
another
thing
when
he
caught
her
looking
at
him
and
though
ally
was
careful
he
did
catch
her
now
and
then
he
always
either
lowered
his
eyelids
or
looked
away
he
was
afraid
to
look
at
her
and
as
everybody
knew
was
an
infallible
sign
why
ally
was
afraid
to
look
at
only
she
could
help
it
her
eyes
were
dragged
to
the
terror
and
the
danger
so
ally
reasoned
in
her
paradise
for
when
rowcliffe
was
once
gone
her
brain
was
frantically
busy
it
never
gave
her
any
rest
from
the
one
stuff
of
its
dreams
it
span
an
endless
shining
thread
from
the
one
thread
it
wove
an
endless
web
of
visions
from
nothing
at
all
it
built
up
drama
after
drama
it
was
all
beautiful
what
ally
brain
did
all
noble
all
marvelously
pure
the
vicar
would
have
been
astonished
if
he
had
known
how
pure
there
was
no
sullen
and
selfish
ally
in
ally
dreams
they
were
all
of
sacrifice
of
of
beautiful
and
noble
things
done
for
rowcliffe
of
suffering
for
rowcliffe
of
dying
for
him
all
without
rowcliffe
being
very
palpably
and
positively
there
it
was
only
at
night
when
ally
brain
slept
among
its
dreams
that
rowcliffe
face
leaned
near
to
hers
without
ever
touching
it
and
his
arms
made
as
if
they
clasped
her
and
never
met
even
then
always
at
the
first
intangible
approach
of
him
she
woke
terrified
because
dreams
go
by
contraries
is
your
sister
always
so
silent
rowcliffe
asked
that
wednesday
the
wednesday
when
ally
had
been
caught
he
was
alone
with
mary
who
ally
no
she
is
silent
at
all
what
do
you
think
of
her
i
think
said
rowcliffe
she
looks
extraordinarily
well
that
owing
to
you
said
mary
i
never
saw
her
pull
round
so
fast
before
no
i
assure
you
said
rowcliffe
i
have
anything
to
do
with
it
he
was
very
stiff
and
cold
and
stern
rowcliffe
was
annoyed
because
it
was
two
wednesdays
running
that
he
had
found
himself
alone
with
the
eldest
and
the
youngest
miss
cartaret
the
second
one
had
gone
off
heaven
knew
where
xxi
the
vicar
of
garth
considered
himself
unhappy
to
say
the
least
of
it
in
his
three
children
but
he
had
never
asked
himself
what
after
all
would
he
have
done
without
them
after
all
as
they
had
frequently
reminded
themselves
without
them
he
could
never
have
lived
comfortably
on
his
income
they
did
the
work
and
saved
him
the
expenses
of
a
second
servant
a
housekeeper
an
an
organist
and
two
curates
the
three
divided
the
work
of
the
vicarage
and
parish
according
to
the
tastes
and
abilities
of
each
at
home
mary
kept
the
house
and
did
the
sewing
gwenda
looked
after
the
gray
and
barren
garden
she
trimmed
the
narrow
paths
and
the
one
and
mowed
the
small
square
of
grass
between
alice
trailed
through
the
lower
rooms
dusting
furniture
feebly
she
gathered
and
arranged
the
flowers
when
there
were
any
in
the
bed
outside
mary
being
sweet
and
good
taught
in
the
boys
alice
because
she
was
fond
of
children
had
the
infants
for
the
rest
mary
who
was
lazy
had
taken
over
that
small
portion
of
the
village
that
was
not
baptist
or
wesleyan
or
congregational
gwenda
for
her
own
amusement
and
regardless
of
sect
and
creed
the
hopelessly
distant
hamlets
and
the
farms
scattered
on
the
long
raking
hillsides
and
the
moors
alice
declared
herself
satisfied
with
her
dominion
over
the
organ
and
the
village
choir
alice
was
behaving
like
an
angel
in
her
paradise
no
longer
listless
and
sullen
she
swept
through
the
house
with
an
angel
energy
a
benign
untiring
angel
sat
at
the
organ
and
controlled
the
violent
voices
of
the
choir
the
choir
looked
upon
ally
innocent
art
with
pride
and
admiration
and
amusement
it
tickled
them
to
see
those
little
hands
grappling
with
organ
pieces
that
had
beaten
the
old
schoolmaster
ally
enjoyed
the
pride
and
admiration
of
the
choir
and
was
unaware
of
its
amusement
she
enjoyed
the
importance
of
her
office
she
enjoyed
the
massive
voluptuous
vibrations
that
made
her
body
a
vehicle
for
the
organ
surging
and
tremendous
soul
ally
body
had
become
a
more
and
more
tremulous
a
more
sensitive
and
perfect
medium
for
vibrations
she
would
not
have
missed
one
choir
practice
or
one
service
and
she
said
to
herself
i
may
be
a
fool
but
papa
or
the
parish
would
have
to
pay
an
organist
at
least
forty
pounds
a
year
it
costs
less
to
keep
me
so
he
need
talk
then
in
november
came
the
preparations
for
the
village
concert
they
were
stupendous
all
morning
the
little
erad
piano
shook
with
the
grande
valse
and
the
grande
polonaise
of
chopin
the
diabolic
thing
raged
through
the
shut
house
knowing
that
it
went
unchallenged
that
its
utmost
violence
was
licensed
until
the
day
after
the
concert
rowcliffe
heard
it
whenever
he
drove
past
the
vicarage
on
his
way
over
the
moors
xxii
rowcliffe
was
now
beginning
to
form
that
other
habit
which
was
to
make
him
even
more
remarkable
than
he
was
already
the
hunting
down
of
gwendolen
cartaret
in
the
open
he
was
annoyed
with
gwendolen
cartaret
when
she
had
all
the
rest
of
the
week
to
walk
in
she
would
set
out
on
wednesdays
before
teatime
and
continue
until
long
after
dark
he
had
missed
her
twice
now
and
on
the
third
wednesday
he
saw
her
swinging
up
the
hill
toward
upthorne
as
he
leaving
his
surgery
came
round
the
corner
of
the
village
by
the
bridge
i
believe
he
thought
she
doing
it
on
purpose
to
avoid
me
he
was
determined
not
to
be
avoided
the
doctor
very
late
this
afternoon
said
mary
i
suppose
been
sent
for
somewhere
alice
said
nothing
she
could
trust
herself
to
speak
she
lived
in
sickening
fear
that
on
some
wednesday
afternoon
he
would
be
sent
for
it
had
never
happened
yet
but
that
made
it
all
the
more
likely
that
it
had
happened
now
they
waited
till
five
till
a
i
really
ca
wait
any
longer
said
mary
for
a
man
who
come
by
that
time
rowcliffe
and
gwenda
were
far
on
the
road
to
upthorne
he
had
overtaken
her
about
a
hundred
yards
above
the
schoolhouse
before
the
road
turned
to
upthorne
moor
i
say
how
you
do
sprint
up
these
hills
she
turned
is
that
you
dr
rowcliffe
of
course
it
me
where
are
you
off
to
upthorne
anywhere
may
i
come
too
if
you
want
to
of
course
i
want
to
have
you
had
any
tea
no
were
they
in
i
did
stop
to
ask
why
not
because
i
saw
you
stampeding
on
in
front
of
me
and
i
swore
overtake
you
before
you
got
round
that
corner
and
i
have
overtaken
you
shall
we
go
back
we
time
he
frowned
no
i
never
turn
back
let
get
on
get
on
they
went
on
at
a
terrific
pace
and
as
she
persisted
in
walking
about
half
a
foot
in
front
of
him
he
saw
the
movement
of
her
fine
long
limbs
and
the
little
ripple
of
her
shoulders
under
the
gray
tweed
presently
he
spoke
it
was
you
i
heard
playing
the
other
night
no
it
must
have
been
my
youngest
sister
i
knew
it
was
you
it
might
have
been
for
all
you
knew
it
could
possibly
if
you
played
you
would
play
that
way
what
way
your
sister
way
whatever
you
wanted
to
do
you
do
it
beautifully
or
not
at
all
she
made
no
response
she
did
not
even
seem
to
have
heard
him
i
do
mean
to
say
he
said
that
your
sister
does
play
beautifully
she
turned
malignly
he
liked
her
when
she
turned
you
mean
that
she
plays
abominably
i
did
mean
to
it
why
should
you
say
it
because
you
do
say
those
things
it
is
polite
but
i
know
alice
does
play
well
not
those
big
things
the
wonder
is
she
can
play
them
at
all
why
does
she
attempt
the
big
things
why
does
anybody
because
she
loves
them
she
never
heard
them
properly
played
so
she
does
know
she
just
trusts
to
her
feeling
is
there
anything
else
after
all
you
trust
i
do
know
you
see
alice
feeling
tells
her
it
all
right
to
play
like
that
and
feeling
tells
me
it
all
wrong
you
can
trust
feelings
why
mine
more
than
hers
because
feelings
are
the
feelings
of
a
beautifully
sane
and
perfectly
balanced
person
how
can
you
possibly
tell
you
do
know
me
i
know
your
type
my
type
is
me
you
ca
tell
by
that
you
can
if
you
a
physiologist
being
a
physiologist
wo
tell
you
anything
about
oh
wo
it
it
ca
why
not
how
can
it
you
think
it
ca
tell
me
anything
about
your
soul
oh
my
soul
her
shoulders
expressed
disdain
for
it
do
you
dislike
my
mentioning
it
would
you
rather
we
did
talk
about
it
perhaps
you
tired
of
having
it
talked
about
no
my
poor
soul
has
never
done
anything
to
get
itself
talked
about
i
only
thought
that
as
your
father
perhaps
specialises
in
souls
he
does
specialise
in
mine
he
knows
nothing
about
it
the
specialist
never
does
to
know
anything
the
least
little
thing
about
the
soul
you
must
know
everything
everything
you
know
about
the
body
so
that
you
wrong
even
about
your
soul
being
a
physiologist
tells
me
that
your
sort
of
body
a
transparently
clean
and
strong
and
utterly
unconscious
body
goes
with
a
transparently
clean
and
strong
and
utterly
unconscious
soul
utterly
unconscious
he
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
answered
utterly
unconscious
they
walked
on
in
silence
till
they
came
in
sight
of
the
marshes
and
the
long
gray
line
of
upthorne
farm
that
where
i
met
you
once
he
said
do
you
remember
you
were
coming
out
of
the
door
as
i
went
in
you
seem
to
have
been
always
meeting
me
always
meeting
you
and
then
missing
you
just
when
i
expected
most
to
find
you
if
we
go
much
farther
in
this
direction
said
gwenda
we
shall
meet
papa
well
i
suppose
some
day
i
shall
have
to
meet
him
do
you
realise
that
i
never
met
him
yet
have
you
no
always
i
been
on
the
point
of
meeting
him
and
always
some
malignant
fate
has
interfered
she
smiled
he
loved
her
smile
why
are
you
smiling
i
was
only
wondering
whether
the
fate
was
really
so
malignant
you
mean
that
if
he
met
me
he
dislike
me
he
always
disliked
anybody
we
like
you
see
he
a
very
funny
father
all
fathers
said
rowcliffe
are
more
or
less
funny
she
laughed
her
laughter
enchanted
him
yes
but
father
does
mean
to
be
as
funny
as
he
is
i
see
he
would
really
mean
to
dislike
me
then
perhaps
if
i
regularly
laid
myself
out
for
it
by
years
of
tender
and
untiring
devotion
i
might
win
him
over
she
laughed
again
she
laughed
as
youth
laughs
for
the
pure
joy
of
laughter
she
looked
on
her
father
as
a
persistent
delightful
jest
he
adored
her
laughter
it
proved
how
strong
and
sane
she
was
if
she
could
take
him
like
that
rowcliffe
had
seen
women
made
bitter
made
morbid
driven
into
lunatic
asylums
by
fathers
who
were
as
funny
as
cartaret
you
would
you
would
she
said
he
funnier
than
you
any
idea
of
is
he
ever
ill
never
that
of
course
makes
it
difficult
except
colds
in
his
head
but
he
would
have
you
for
a
cold
in
his
head
he
would
have
you
for
anything
if
he
could
help
it
well
perhaps
if
he
as
funny
as
all
that
we
better
turn
they
turned
they
were
walking
so
fast
now
that
they
could
talk
presently
they
slackened
and
he
spoke
i
say
shall
you
ever
get
away
from
this
place
never
i
think
do
you
never
want
to
get
away
no
never
you
see
i
love
it
i
know
you
do
he
said
it
savagely
as
if
he
were
jealous
of
the
place
so
do
you
she
answered
if
i
did
i
suppose
i
should
have
to
yes
it
better
if
you
got
to
live
in
it
that
was
what
i
meant
after
that
they
were
silent
for
a
long
time
she
was
wondering
what
he
did
mean
when
they
reached
the
vicarage
gate
he
sheered
off
the
path
and
held
out
his
hand
oh
are
you
coming
in
for
tea
she
said
thanks
no
it
a
little
late
i
do
think
i
want
any
he
paused
i
got
what
i
wanted
he
stepped
backward
facing
her
raising
his
cap
then
he
turned
and
hurried
down
the
hill
gwenda
walked
slowly
up
the
flagged
path
to
the
house
door
she
stood
there
thinking
he
got
what
he
wanted
he
only
wanted
to
see
what
i
was
like
xxiii
rowcliffe
had
ten
minutes
on
his
hands
while
they
were
bringing
his
trap
round
from
the
red
lion
he
was
warming
his
hands
at
the
surgery
fire
when
he
heard
voices
in
the
parlor
on
the
other
side
of
the
narrow
passage
one
voice
pleaded
the
other
reserved
judgment
do
you
think
he
do
it
if
i
were
to
go
up
and
ask
him
it
was
alice
cartaret
voice
i
caan
say
miss
cartaret
i
sure
could
you
persuade
him
yourself
mrs
blenkiron
it
would
be
a
bit
of
good
me
persuadin
him
jim
greatorex
boodge
mooch
for
me
a
pause
alice
was
wavering
aware
no
doubt
of
the
folly
of
her
errand
rowcliffe
had
only
to
lie
low
and
she
would
go
could
mr
blenkiron
no
rowcliffe
in
the
surgery
smiled
all
to
himself
as
he
warmed
his
hands
alice
was
holding
her
ground
she
was
spinning
out
the
time
not
he
blenkiron
got
soomat
alse
to
do
without
trapseing
after
jim
greatorex
oh
alice
voice
was
distant
and
defensive
he
was
sorry
for
alice
she
was
not
yet
broken
in
to
the
north
country
manner
and
her
softness
winced
under
these
blows
there
was
nobody
to
tell
her
that
blenkiron
manner
was
a
criticism
of
her
young
kinsman
jim
greatorex
blenkiron
presently
made
this
apparent
jim
sat
oop
enoof
as
it

and
all
another
pause
rowcliffe
was
interested
alice
was
really
displaying
considerable
intelligence
almost
she
persuaded
him
that
her
errand
was
genuine
do
you
think
essy
gale
could
get
him
to
come
in
the
surgery
rowcliffe
whistled
inaudibly
was
indeed
a
desperate
shift
rowcliffe
had
turned
and
was
now
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
he
was
intensely
interested
assy
gaale
he
would
n
coom
for
assy
asskin
a
man
like
greatorex
blenkiron
blood
the
blood
of
the

up

said
jim
greatorex
kinswoman
if

greatorex
to
sing
for
you
as
bad
as
all
that
miss
cartaret

the
doctor
rowcliffe
became
suddenly
grave
he
watched
the
door
he
mebbe
do
it
for
him
he
sats
soom
store
by
dr
rawcliffe
but
ally
voice
sounded
nearer

minx
the
little
little
minx
naw
but
he
joost
goin

catch
him
you
might
blenkiron
caught
him
on
the
threshold
of
the
surgery
will
you
speak
to
miss
cartaret
a
minute
dr
rawcliffe
certainly
blenkiron
withdrew
the
kitchen
door
closed
on
her
flight
for
the
first
time
in
their
acquaintance
rowcliffe
was
alone
with
alice
cartaret
and
though
he
was
interested
he
did
like
it
i
thought
i
heard
your
voice
said
he
with
reckless
geniality
they
stood
on
their
thresholds
looking
at
each
other
across
the
narrow
passage
it
was
as
if
alice
cartaret
feet
were
fixed
there
by
an
invisible
force
that
held
her
fascinated
and
yet
frightened
rowcliffe
had
paused
too
as
at
a
post
of
vantage
the
better
to
observe
her
a
moment
ago
warming
his
hands
in
the
surgery
he
could
have
sworn
that
she
the
little
maneuvering
minx
had
laid
a
trap
for
him
she
had
come
on
her
fool
errand
knowing
that
it
was
a
fool
errand
for
nothing
on
earth
but
that
she
might
catch
him
alone
and
defenseless
in
the
surgery
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
she
did
the
sort
of
thing
she
always
would
do
she
did
want
to
know
not
she
whether
jim
greatorex
would
sing
or
not
she
wanted
to
know
and
she
meant
to
know
why
he
steven
rowcliffe
had
turned
up
that
afternoon
and
where
he
had
gone
and
what
he
had
been
doing
and
the
rest
of
it
there
were
windows
at
the
back
of
the
vicarage
possibly
she
had
seen
him
charging
up
the
hill
in
pursuit
of
her
sister
and
she
was
desperate
all
this
he
had
believed
and
did
still
believe
but
as
he
looked
across
at
the
little
hesitating
figure
and
the
scared
face
framed
in
the
doorway
he
had
compassion
on
her
poor
little
trapper
so
pitifully
trapped
so
ignorant
of
the
first
rules
and
principles
of
trapping
that
she
had
run
after
her
prey
when
she
should
have
lain
low
and
lured
it
silently
into
her
snare
she
was
no
more
than
a
poor
little
frightened
minx
caught
in
his
trap
peering
at
him
from
it
in
terror
god
knew
he
had
meant
to
set
it
for
her
and
god
only
knew
how
he
was
going
to
get
her
out
of
it
poor
things
he
thought
if
they
only
knew
how
horribly
they
embarrass
me
for
of
course
she
was
the
first
the
situation
had
repeated
itself
monotonously
scores
of
times
in
his
experience
it
would
have
been
a
nuisance
even
if
alice
cartaret
had
not
been
gwendolen
sister
that
made
it
intolerable
all
this
complex
pity
and
repugnance
was
latent
in
his
one
sense
of
horrible
embarrassment
then
their
hands
met
you
want
to
see
me
i
she
was
writhing
piteously
in
the
trap
you
better
come
into
the
surgery
there
a
fire
there
he
was
going
to
keep
her
out
there
in
the
cold
and
he
was
going
to
walk
back
with
her
to
the
vicarage
he
did
want
to
meet
the
vicar
and
have
the
door
shut
in
his
face
rowcliffe
informed
by
blenkiron
was
aware
long
before
gwenda
had
warned
him
that
he
ran
this
risk
the
vicar
funniness
was
a
byword
in
the
parish
but
he
left
the
door
ajar
well
he
said
gently
what
is
it
shall
you
be
seeing
jim
greatorex
soon
i
might
why
she
told
her
tale
again
she
told
it
in
little
bursts
of
excitement
punctuated
with
shy
hesitations
she
told
it
with
all
sorts
of
twists
and
turns
winding
and
entangling
herself
in
it
and
coming
out
again
breathless
and
frightened
like
a
lost
creature
that
has
been
dragged
through
the
brake
and
there
were
long
pauses
when
alice
put
her
head
on
one
side
considering
as
if
she
held
her
tale
in
her
hands
and
were
looking
at
it
and
wondering
whether
she
really
could
go
on
and
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
do
said
rowcliffe
finally
to
ask
him
had
you
better
ask
him
yourself
would
he
do
it
for
me
of
course
he
would
i
wonder
perhaps
if
i
asked
him
prettily
oh
then
he
could
help
himself
there
was
a
pause
rowcliffe
a
little
ashamed
of
himself
looked
at
the
floor
and
alice
looked
at
rowcliffe
and
tried
to
fathom
the
full
depth
of
his
meaning
from
his
face
that
there
was
a
depth
and
that
there
was
a
meaning
she
never
doubted
this
time
rowcliffe
missed
the
pathos
of
her
gray
eyes
an
idea
had
come
to
him
look
here
miss
cartaret
if
you
can
get
jim
greatorex
to
sing
for
you
if
you
can
get
him
to
take
an
interest
in
the
concert
or
in
any
mortal
thing
besides
beer
and
whisky
you
be
doing
the
best
work
you
ever
did
in
your
life
do
you
think
i
she
said
i
think
you
could
probably
do
anything
with
him
if
you
gave
your
mind
to
it
he
meant
it
he
meant
it
that
was
really
his
opinion
of
her
her
lifted
face
was
radiant
as
she
drank
bliss
at
one
draught
from
the
cup
he
held
to
her
but
she
was
not
yet
satisfied
you
me
to
do
it
i
should
very
much
his
voice
was
firm
but
his
eyes
looked
uneasy
and
ashamed
would
you
like
me
to
get
him
back
in
the
choir
i
like
you
to
get
him
back
into
anything
that
keep
him
out
of
mischief
she
raised
her
chin
there
was
a
more
determined
look
on
her
small
her
rather
insignificant
face
than
he
would
have
thought
to
see
there
she
rose
very
well
she
said
superbly
i
do
it
he
held
out
his
hand
i
do
say
miss
cartaret
that
you
reclaim
him
nor
i
but
if
you
want
me
to
i
try
they
parted
on
it
rowcliffe
smiled
as
he
closed
the
surgery
door
behind
him
that
give
her
something
else
to
think
about
he
said
to
himself
and
it
take
her
all
her
time
xxiv
the
next
sunday
early
in
the
afternoon
alice
went
all
by
herself
to
upthorne
hitherto
she
had
disliked
going
to
upthorne
by
herself
she
had
no
very
subtle
feeling
for
the
aspects
of
things
but
there
was
something
about
the
road
to
upthorne
that
repelled
her
a
hundred
yards
or
so
above
the
schoolhouse
it
turned
leaving
behind
it
the
wide
green
bottom
and
winding
up
toward
the
naked
moor
to
the
north
on
her
right
it
narrowed
and
twisted
the
bed
of
the
beck
lay
hidden
a
thin
scrub
of
low
thorn
trees
covered
the
lower
slopes
of
the
further
hillside
here
and
there
was
a
clearing
and
a
cottage
or
a
farm
on
her
left
she
had
to
pass
the
dead
mining
station
the
roofless
walls
the
black
window
gaps
the
melancholy
haunted
colonnades
the
three
chimneys
of
the
dead
furnaces
square
cornered
shooting
straight
and
high
as
the
of
some
hill
city
of
the
south
beautiful
and
sinister
guarding
that
place
of
ashes
and
of
ruin
then
the
sallow
winter
marshes
south
of
the
marshes
were
the
high
moors
their
flanks
showed
black
where
they
have
been
flayed
by
the
cuttings
of
old
mines
at
intervals
along
the
line
of
the
hillside
masses
of
rubble
rose
in
hummocks
or
hung
like
avalanches
black
as
if
they
had
been
discharged
by
blasting
beyond
in
the
turn
of
the
dale
the
village
of
upthorne
lay
unseen
and
hitherto
in
all
that
immense
and
inhuman
desolation
nothing
to
alice
had
been
more
melancholy
more
sinister
more
haunted
than
the
house
where
john
greatorex
had
died
with
its
gray
unsleeping
face
its
lidless
eyes
staring
out
over
the
marshes
it
had
lost
for
alice
all
likeness
to
a
human
habitation
it
repudiated
the
living
it
remembered
it
kept
a
grim
watch
with
its
dead
but
alice
mind
acutely
sensitive
in
one
direction
had
become
callous
in
every
other
greatorex
was
in
the
kitchen
smoking
his
sunday
afternoon
pipe
in
the
chimney
corner
screened
from
the
open
doorway
by
the
thickness
of
the
house
wall
maggie
his
servant
planted
firmly
on
the
threshold
jerked
her
head
over
her
shoulder
to
call
to
him
there
a
yoong
laady
wants
to
see
yo
mr
greatorex
there
was
no
response
but
a
sharp
tapping
on
the
hob
as
greatorex
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
maggie
stood
looking
at
alice
a
little
mournfully
with
her
blue
pathetic
eyes
maggie
had
once
been
pretty
in
spite
of
her
drab
hair
and
flat
features
but
where
her
high
color
remained
it
had
hardened
with
her
years
well
yo
coom
maggie
called
again
and
waited
courageous
in
her
bright
blue
sunday
gown
she
waited
while
her
master
rose
then
as
if
driven
by
some
sharp
sign
from
him
she
slunk
into
the
scullery
jim
greatorex
appeared
on
his
threshold
on
his
threshold
utterly
sober
carrying
himself
with
the
assurance
of
the
master
in
his
own
house
he
would
not
have
suffered
by
comparison
with
any
man
instead
of
the
black
broadcloth
that
alice
had
expected
he
wore
a
loose
brown
shooting
jacket
drab
corduroy
breeches
a
drab
cloth
waistcoat
and
brown
leather
leggings
and
he
wore
them
with
a
distinction
that
rowcliffe
might
have
envied
his
face
his
whole
body
alert
and
upright
had
the
charm
of
some
shy
animal
when
he
stood
at
ease
his
whole
face
with
all
its
features
sensed
you
and
took
you
in
the
quivering
eyebrows
were
aware
of
you
the
nose
with
its
short
high
bridge
its
fine
wide
nostrils
repeated
the
sensitive
stare
of
the
wide
eyes
his
mouth
under
its
golden
brown
moustache
was
somber
with
a
sort
of
sullen
apprehension
till
in
a
sudden
childlike
confidence
it
smiled
his
whole
face
and
all
its
features
smiled
he
was
smiling
at
alice
now
as
if
struck
all
of
a
sudden
by
her
smallness
i
come
to
ask
a
favor
greatorex
said
alice
ay
said
greatorex
he
said
it
as
if
ladies
called
every
day
to
ask
him
favors
will
you
coom
in
miss
cartaret
it
was
the
mournful
and
musical
voice
that
she
had
heard
sometimes
last
summer
on
the
road
outside
the
back
door
of
the
vicarage
she
came
in
pausing
on
the
threshold
and
looking
about
her
as
if
she
stood
poised
on
the
edge
of
an
adventure
her
smallness
and
the
delicious
exploring
air
of
her
melted
jim
heart
and
made
him
smile
at
her
it
a
roough
plaace
fer
a
laady
he
said
it
a
beautiful
place
greatorex
said
alice
and
she
did
actually
think
it
was
beautiful
with
its
stone
floor
its
walls
its
black
oak
dresser
and
chest
and
settle
not
because
of
these
things
but
because
it
was
on
the
border
of
her
paradise
rowcliffe
had
sent
her
there
jim
greatorex
had
glamour
for
her
less
on
his
own
account
than
as
a
man
in
whom
rowcliffe
was
interested
you
think
it
a
bit
loansoom
wouldn
yo
ef
yo
staayed
in
it
yeear
in
and
yeear
out
i
do
know
said
alice
doubtfully
perhaps
a
little
she
ventured
encouraged
by
greatorex
indulgent
smile
an
loansoom
it
is
said
greatorex
dismally
alice
explored
penetrating

coomfortable
for
you
she
rose
and
followed
him
she
had
been
long
enough
in
garth
to
know
that
if
you
are
asked
to
go
into
the
parlor
you
must
go
otherwise
you
risk
offending
the
kind
gods
of
the
hearth
and
threshold
the
parlor
was
a
long
low
room
that
continued
the
line
of
the
house
to
its
southern
end
one
wide
mullioned
window
looked
east
over
the
marsh
the
other
south
to
the
hillside
across
a
little
orchard
of
dwarfed
and
twisted
trees
to
alice
they
were
the
trees
of
her
paradise
and
the
hillside
was
its
boundary
greatorex
drew
close
to
the
hearth
the
horsehair
and
mahogany
armchair
with
the
white
antimacassar
sit

and
i

on
his
knees
before
her
lighting
the
fire
you
wet
feet
coomin
over
t
moor
cauld
too
yo

she
sat
and
watched
him
he
was
deft
with
his
great
hands
like
a
woman
over
his
there
she
burning
fine
he
rose
turning
triumphantly
on
his
hearth
as
the
flame
leaped
in
the
grate
yo
let
me
mak
yo
a
coop
of
tae
miss
cartaret
there
was
an
interrogative
lilt
at
the
end
of
all
his
sentences
even
when
as
now
he
was
making
statements
that
admitted
of
no
denial
but
his
guest
missed
the
incontrovertible
and
final
quality
of
what
was
said
please
do
trouble
it
naw
trooble
naw
trooble
at
all
maaggie

kitchen
maaggie
maaggie

t
parlor
alice
looked
about
her
while
she
waited
though
she
did
know
it
jim
greatorex
parlor
was
a
more
tolerable
place
than
the
vicarage
brown
cocoanut
matting
covered
its
stone
floor
in
front
of
the
wide
hearth
on
the
inner
wall
was
a
rug
of
dyed
sheepskin
bordered
with
a
strip
of
scarlet
snippets
the
wooden
the
the
black
hobs
the
straight
barred
grate
with
its
frame
of
fine
fluted
iron
belonged
to
a
period
of
simplicity
the
oblong
mahogany
table
in
the
center
of
the
room
the
sofa
and
chairs
upholstered
in
horsehair
were
of
a
style
austere
enough
to
be
almost
beautiful
down
the
white
ground
of
the
an
endless
succession
of
pink
nosegays
ascended
and
descended
between
parallel
stripes
of
blue
there
were
no
ornaments
to
speak
of
in
greatorex
parlor
but
the
grocer
on
the
mantelshelf
and
the
little
china
figures
the
spotted
cows
the
curly
dogs
the
boy
in
blue
the
girl
in
pink
and
the
lustre
ware
and
the
the
white
and
gold
the
blue
and
white
crowded
behind
the
diamond
panes
of
the
two
black
oak
cupboards
of
these
one
was
set
in
the
most
conspicuous
corner
the
other
in
the
middle
of
the
long
wall
facing
the
east
window
bare
save
for
the
framed
photographs
of
greatorex
family
the
groups
the
portraits
of
father
and
mother
and
of
grandparents
enlarged
from
vignettes
taken
in
the
seventies
and
eighties
faces
defiant
stolid
and
pathetic
yearning
mournful
tender
faces
slightly
blurred
all
these
objects
impressed
themselves
on
ally
brain
adhering
to
its
obsession
and
receiving
from
it
an
immense
significance
and
importance
she
heard
maggie
running
feet
and
the
great
leisurely
steps
of
greatorex
and
his
voice
soft
and
kind
encouraging
maggie
theer
that

maggie
whispered
awestruck
by
these
preparations
which
coops
will
yo
mr
greatorex
t
best
coops
maaggie
maggie
had
to
fetch
them
from
the
corner
cupboard
they
were
the
white
and
gold
at
greatorex
command
she
brought
the
little
round
oak
table
from
its
place
in
the
front
window
and
set
it
by
the
hearth
before
the
visitor
humbly
under
her
master
eye
yet
with
a
sort
of
happy
pride
about
her
she
set
out
the
and
the
glass
dishes
of
jam
and
honey
and
greatorex
waited
silent
and
awkward
till
his
servant
had
left
the
room
then
he
came
forward
theer
caake
he
said
maaggie
baaked
un
yesterda
an
hooney
he
made
no
servile
apologies
for
what
he
set
before
her
he
was
giving
her
nothing
that
was
not
good
and
he
knew
it
and
he
sat
down
facing
her
and
watched
her
pour
out
her
tea
and
help
herself
with
her
little
delicate
hands
if
he
had
been
a
common
man
a
peasant
his
idea
of
courtesy
would
have
been
to
leave
her
to
herself
to
turn
away
his
eyes
from
her
in
that
intimate
and
sacred
act
of
eating
and
drinking
but
greatorex
was
a
farmer
the
descendant
of
yeomen
and
by
courtesy
a
yeoman
still
and
courtesy
bade
him
watch
and
see
that
his
guest
wanted
for
nothing
that
he
did
not
sit
down
at
the
little
table
and
drink
tea
with
her
himself
showed
that
his
courtesy
knew
where
to
draw
the
dividing
line
but
why
are
you
having
anything
yourself
said
alice
she
really
wondered
he
smiled
it
a
bit
too
early
for
me
thank
yo
maaggie
mak
me
a
coop
by
and
bye
and
she
said
to
herself
how
beautifully
he
did
it
he
was
indeed
doing
it
beautifully
all
through
he
watched
her
little
fingers
and
the
very
instant
they
had
disposed
of
a
morsel
he
offered
her
another
it
was
a
deep
and
exquisite
pleasure
to
him
to
observe
her
in
that
act
of
eating
and
drinking
he
had
never
seen
anything
like
the
prettiness
the
dainty
precision
that
she
brought
to
it
he
had
never
seen
anything
so
pretty
as
ally
herself
in
the
rough
gray
tweed
that
exaggerated
her
fineness
and
fragility
never
anything
so
distracting
and
at
the
same
time
so
heartrending
as
the
gray
muff
and
collar
of
squirrel
fur
and
the
little
gray
fur
hat
with
the
bit
of
blue
peacock
breast
laid
on
one
side
of
it
like
a
folded
wing
as
he
watched
her
he
thought
if
i
was
to
touch
her
i
should
break
her
then
the
conversation
began
i
was
sorry
he
said
to
hear
yo
was
so
poorly
miss
cartaret
i
all
right
now
you
can
see
i
all
right
he
shook
his
head
i
saw
yo
a
moonth
ago
and
i
did
think
then
i
sud
aver
see
yo
at
oopthorne
again
he
paused
a
woonderful
maan
dr
rawcliffe
he
is
said
alice
her
voice
was
very
soft
inaudible
as
a
breath
all
the
blood
in
her
body
seemed
to
rush
into
her
face
and
flood
it
and
spread
up
her
forehead
to
the
roots
of
the
gold
hair
that
the
east
wind
had
crisped
round
the
edges
of
her
hat
she
thought
it
be
awful
if
he
guesses
and
if
he
talks
but
when
she
looked
at
greatorex
his
face
reassured
her
it
was
so
utterly
innocent
of
divination
and
the
next
moment
he
went
straight
to
the
matter
in
hand
an
what
this
thing
you
coom
to
aassk
me
miss
cartaret
well
she
looked
at
him
and
her
gray
eyes
were
soft
and
charmingly
candid
it
if
you
be
kind
enough
to
sing
at
our
concert
you
heard
about
it
ay
i
heard
about
it
right
enoof
well
you
you
sung
you
know
yes
i
soong
but
thot
was
in
t
owd
schoolmaaster
time
would
care
to
hear
my
singin
now
i
got
out
of
the
way
of
it
like
you
have
greatorex
i
heard
you
you
got
a
magnificent
voice
there
is
one
like
it
in
the
choir
ay
there
not
mooch
wrong
with
my
voice
i
rackon
but
it
like
this
look
yo
i
joost
soong
fer
t
schoolmaaster
he
was
a
friend
a
personal
friend
of
mine
and
he
gone
and
i
sure
i
doan
knaw
i
know
greatorex
i
know
exactly
how
you
feel
about
it
you
sang
to
please
your
friend
he
gone
and
you
do
like
the
idea
of
singing
for
anybody
else
for
a
set
of
people
you
do
know
she
had
said
it
it
was
the
naked
truth
and
he
was
going
to
deny
it
she
went
on
we
strangers
and
perhaps
you
do
like
us
very
much
and
you
feel
that
singing
for
us
would
be
like
singing
the
lord
song
in
a
strange
country
you
feel
as
if
it
would
be
profanation
a
kind
of
disloyalty
thot
it
thot
it
never
had
he
been
so
well
interpreted
it
that
and
it
because
you
miss
him
so
awfully
wall
he
seemed
inclined
in
sheer
honesty
to
deprecate
the
extreme
and
passionate
emotion
she
suggested
i
would
n
saay
course
i
sort
o
miss
him
i
caan
afford
to
lose
a
friend
i
so
many
of
i
know
it
the
waters
of
babylon
and
you
hanging
up
your
voice
in
the
willow
tree
she
could
be
gay
and
fluent
enough
with
greatorex
who
was
nothing
to
her
but
it
an
awful
pity
a
willow
tree
ca
do
anything
with
a
big
barytone
voice
hung
up
in
it
he
laughed
then
and
afterward
whenever
he
thought
of
it
he
laughed
she
saw
that
he
had
adopted
his
attitude
first
of
all
in
resentment
that
he
had
continued
it
as
a
passionate
melancholy
pose
and
that
he
was
only
keeping
it
up
through
sheer
obstinacy
he
would
be
glad
of
a
decent
excuse
to
abandon
it
if
he
could
find
one
and
your
friend
must
have
been
proud
of
your
voice
was
he
he
sat
more
store
by
it
than
what
i
do
it
was
he
look
yo
who
trained
me
so
as
i
could
sing
proper
well
then
he
must
have
taken
some
trouble
over
it
do
you
think
he
like
you
to
go
and
hang
it
up
in
a
willow
tree
greatorex
looked
up
showing
a
shamefaced
smile
the
little
lass
had
beaten
him
coom
to
think
of
it
i
doan
knaw
as
he
would
like
it
mooch
of
course
he
would
like
it
it
would
be
wasting
what
he
done
so
would
i
naver
thought
of
it
like
thot
she
rose
she
knew
the
moment
of
surrender
and
she
knew
that
it
must
not
be
overpassed
she
stood
before
him
drawing
on
her
gloves
fastening
her
squirrel
collar
and
settling
her
chin
in
the
warm
fur
with
the
movement
of
a
small
burrowing
animal
a
movement
that
captivated
greatorex
then
deliberately
and
finally
she
held
out
her
hand
greatorex
it
all
right
is
it
you
coming
to
sing
for
you
know
not
for
i
coomin
said
greatorex
she
settled
her
chin
again
tucked
her
hands
away
in
the
squirrel
muff
and
went
quickly
toward
the
door
he
followed
let
me
putt
daasy
in
t
trap
miss
cartaret
and
drive
yo
home
i
would
think
of
it
thank
you
all
the
same
she
was
in
the
kitchen
now
on
the
outer
threshold
he
followed
her
there
miss
cartaret
she
turned
well
his
face
was
flushed
to
the
eyes
he
struggled
visibly
for
expression
yo
moosn
saay
i
doan
like
yo
fer
it
nat
the
truth
i
glad
it
is
she
said
he
walked
with
her
down
the
bridle
path
to
the
gate
he
was
dumb
after
his
apocalypse
they
parted
at
the
gate
with
long
slow
thoughtful
strides
greatorex
returned
along
the
bridle
path
to
his
house
alice
went
gaily
down
the
hill
to
garth
it
was
the
hill
of
paradise
and
if
she
thought
of
greatorex
and
of
how
she
had
cajoled
him
into
singing
and
of
how
through
singing
she
would
reclaim
him
it
was
because
greatorex
and
his
song
and
his
redemption
were
a
small
hardly
significant
part
of
the
immense
thought
of
rowcliffe
how
pleased
he
be
when
he
knows
what
i
done
and
her
pure
joy
had
a
strain
in
it
that
was
not
so
pure
it
pleased
her
to
please
rowcliffe
but
it
pleased
her
also
that
he
should
realise
her
as
a
woman
who
could
cajole
men
into
doing
for
her
what
they
did
want
to
do
i
got
him
i
got
him
she
cried
as
she
came
triumphant
into
the
where
her
father
and
her
sisters
still
sat
round
the
table
no
thanks
i
had
tea
where
did
you
get
it
the
vicar
asked
with
his
customary
suspicion
at
upthorne
jim
greatorex
gave
it
me
the
vicar
was
appeased
he
thought
nothing
of
it
that
greatorex
should
have
given
his
daughter
tea
greatorex
was
part
of
the
parish
xxv
rowcliffe
was
coming
to
the
concert
neither
floods
nor
tempests
he
declared
would
keep
him
away
from
it
for
hours
night
after
night
of
the
week
before
the
concert
jim
greatorex
had
been
down
at
garth
in
the
schoolhouse
practicing
with
alice
cartaret
until
she
assured
him
he
was
perfect
night
after
night
the
schoolhouse
gray
in
its
still
yard
had
a
door
kept
open
for
them
and
a
light
in
the
solemn
lancet
windows
the
tall
gray
ash
tree
that
stood
back
in
the
angle
of
the
porch
knew
of
their
coming
and
their
going
the
ash
tree
was
friendly
when
the
north
wind
tossed
its
branches
it
beckoned
to
the
two
it
summoned
them
from
up
and
down
the
hill
and
now
the
tables
and
blackboards
had
been
cleared
out
of
the
big
schoolroom
the
matchboarding
of
white
pine
that
lined
the
lower
half
of
its
walls
had
been
hung
with
red
twill
with
garlands
of
ivy
and
bunches
of
holly
oil
lamps
swung
from
the
pine
rafters
of
the
ceiling
and
were
set
on
brackets
at
intervals
along
the
walls
a
few
boards
raised
on
joists
made
an
admirable
platform
one
broad
strip
of
red
felt
was
laid
along
the
platform
another
hid
the
wooden
steps
that
led
to
it
on
the
right
a
cottage
piano
was
set
slantwise
in
the
front
were
chairs
for
the
principal
performers
on
the
left
already
in
their
places
were
the
chosen
from
the
village
choir
behind
on
benches
the
rest
of
the
choir
over
the
whole
scene
on
the
chalk
white
of
the
dado
the
blond
yellow
of
varnished
pinewood
the
blazing
scarlet
of
the
hangings
the
dark
glitter
of
the
ivy
and
the
holly
on
the
faces
ruddy
and
sallow
polished
with
cleanliness
on
the
sleek
hair
on
the
pale
frocks
of
the
girls
the
bright
neckties
of
the
men
the
lamplight
rioted
and
exulted
it
rippled
and
flowed
it
darted
it
lay
suave
and
smooth
as
still
water
it
flaunted
it
veiled
itself
stately
and
tall
and
in
a
measured
order
the
lancet
windows
shot
up
out
of
the
gray
walls
the
leaded
framework
of
their
lozenges
gray
on
the
black
and
solemn
night
behind
them
a
smell
of
dust
of
pine
wood
of
pomade
of
burning
oil
of
an
iron
stove
fiercely
heated
a
thin
bitter
smell
of
ivy
and
holly
that
wonderful
that
overpowering
inspiring
and
revolting
smell
of
elements
strangely
fused
of
flying
vapors
of
breathing
burning
palpitating
things
greatorex
conspicuous
in
his
front
seat
on
the
platform
drew
it
in
with
great
heavings
of
his
chest
he
loved
that
smell
it
fairly
intoxicated
him
every
time
it
soared
singing
through
his
nostrils
into
his
brain
like
gin
there
could
be
no
more
violent
and
voluptuous
contrast
of
sensations
than
to
come
straight
from
the
cold
biting
air
of
upthorne
and
to
step
into
that
perfect
smell
it
was
a
thick
a
sweet
a
fiery
and
sustaining
smell
it
helped
him
to
face
without
too
intolerable
an
agony
the
line
of
alien
he
deemed
them
alien
faces
in
the
front
row
of
the
audience
cartaret
and
miss
cartaret
utter
strangers
he
had
never
got
he
never
would
get
used
to
them
and
rowcliffe
not
altogether
a
stranger
after
what
he
had
done
one
night
for
greatorex
mare
daisy
then
miss
gwendolen
not
a
stranger
either
after
what
she
had
done
and
yet
formidably
strange
the
strangest
when
he
came
to
think
of
it
and
the
queerest
of
them
all
rowcliffe
he
observed
sat
between
her
and
her
sister
divided
from
them
by
a
gap
more
strangers
three
girls
whom
rowcliffe
had
driven
over
from
morfe
and
afterward
greatorex
observed
that
also
for
he
kept
his
eye
on
him
had
shamelessly
abandoned
if
greatorex
had
his
eye
on
rowcliffe
rowcliffe
had
his
eye
though
less
continuously
on
him
he
did
not
know
very
much
about
greatorex
after
all
and
he
could
not
be
sure
that
his
man
would
turn
up
entirely
sober
he
was
unaware
of
greatorex
capacity
for
substituting
one
intoxication
for
another
he
had
no
conception
of
what
the
smell
of
that
lighted
and
decorated
room
meant
for
this
man
who
lived
so
simply
and
profoundly
by
his
senses
and
his
soul
it
was
interfused
and
tangled
with
greatorex
sublimest
feelings
it
was
the
of
submerged
memories
of
secret
unsuspected
passions
it
held
in
its
impalpable
web
his
dreams
the
divine
and
delicate
things
that
his
grosser
self
let
slip
he
would
forget
forget
for
ages
until
in
the
schoolroom
at
concert
time
at
the
first
caress
of
the
magical
smell
those
delicate
and
divine
those
secret
submerged
and
forgotten
things
arose
and
with
the
undying
poignancy
and
subtlety
of
odors
they
entered
into
him
again
and
besides
these
qualities
which
were
indefinable
the
smell
was
vividly
symbolic
it
was
entwined
with
and
it
stood
for
his
experience
of
art
and
ambition
and
the
power
to
move
men
and
women
for
song
and
for
the
sensuous
thrill
and
spiritual
ecstasy
of
singing
and
for
the
subsequent
applause
it
was
the
only
form
of
intoxication
known
to
him
that
did
not
end
in
headache
and
in
shame
suddenly
the
charm
that
had
sustained
him
ceased
to
work
under
it
he
had
been
sitting
in
suspense
waiting
for
something
knowing
and
not
daring
to
own
to
himself
what
it
was
he
waited
for
the
suspense
and
the
waiting
seemed
all
part
of
the
original
excitement
then
alice
cartaret
came
up
the
room
her
passage
had
been
obscured
and
obstructed
by
the
crowd
of
villagers
at
the
door
but
they
had
cleared
a
way
for
her
and
she
came
she
carried
herself
like
a
crowned
princess
the
cords
of
her
cloak
it
was
of
dove
color
lined
with
blue
had
loosened
in
her
passage
and
the
cloak
had
slipped
showing
her
naked
shoulders
she
wore
a
little
gown
with
some
blue
about
it
and
a
necklace
of
pale
amber
her
white
arms
hung
slender
as
a
child
from
the
immense
puffs
of
the
sleeves
her
fair
hair
was
piled
in
front
of
a
high
amber
comb
as
she
appeared
before
the
platform
rowcliffe
rose
and
took
her
cloak
from
her
greatorex
saw
him
take
it
but
he
did
care
he
knew
more
about
the
doctor
than
the
doctor
knew
himself
he
handed
her
up
the
steps
on
to
the
platform
and
then
turned
like
a
man
who
has
done
all
that
chivalry
requires
of
him
to
his
place
between
her
sisters
the
hand
that
rowcliffe
had
let
go
went
suddenly
to
her
throat
seizing
her
necklace
and
loosening
it
as
if
it
choked
her
rowcliffe
was
not
looking
at
her
still
with
her
hand
at
her
throat
she
smiled
and
bowed
to
the
audience
to
the
choir
to
greatorex
to
the
schoolmaster
who
came
forward
greatorex
cursed
him
and
led
her
to
the
piano
she
sat
down
wiped
her
hands
on
her
handkerchief
and
waited
enduring
like
an
angel
the
voices
of
the
villagers
and
the
shuffling
of
their
feet
then
somebody
it
was
the
vicar
said
hush
and
she
began
to
play
in
her
passion
for
the
unattainable
she
had
selected
chopin
grande
valse
in
a
flat
beginning
with
the
long
shake
of
eight
bars
greatorex
did
not
know
whether
she
played
well
or
badly
he
only
knew
it
looked
and
sounded
wonderful
he
could
have
watched
forever
her
little
hands
that
were
like
white
birds
he
had
never
seen
anything
more
delicious
and
more
amusing
than
their
fluttering
in
the
long
shake
and
their
flying
with
spread
wings
all
over
the
piano
then
the
jumping
and
the
thumping
began
and
queer
noises
the
like
of
which
greatorex
had
never
heard
came
out
of
the
piano
it
jarred
him
but
it
made
him
smile
the
little
hands
were
marvelous
the
way
they
flew
the
way
they
leaped
across
great
spaces
of
piano
alice
herself
was
satisfied
she
had
brought
out
the
air
she
had
made
it
sing
above
the
confusion
of
the
bass
and
treble
that
evidently
had
had
no
clear
understanding
when
they
started
as
for
the
bad
bits
the
tremendous
crescendo
chords
that
your
hands
must
take
at
a
flying
leap
or
miss
altogether
rowcliffe
had
already
assured
her
that
they
were
impracticable
anyhow
and
rowcliffe
knew
flushed
and
softened
with
the
applause
rowcliffe
had
joined
in
it
she
took
her
place
between
greatorex
and
the
schoolmaster
the
two
men
and
two
women
came
forward
and
sang
their
glees
turning
and
bowing
to
each
other
like
mummers
the
schoolmaster
recited
the
pied
piper
of
hamelin
a
young
lady
who
had
come
over
from
morfe
expressly
for
that
purpose
sang
the
everlasting
song
about
the
miller
leaning
stiffly
forward
her
thin
neck
outstretched
her
brows
bent
toward
rowcliffe
summoning
all
that
she
knew
of
archness
to
her
eyes
she
sang
oh
miller
miller
miller
miller
miller
let
me
go
sang
the
young
lady
from
morfe
alice
could
see
that
she
sang
for
rowcliffe
and
at
rowcliffe
she
sang
into
his
face
until
he
turned
it
away
and
then
utterly
unabashed
she
sang
into
his
left
ear
the
presence
and
the
song
of
the
young
lady
from
morfe
would
have
been
torture
to
alice
but
that
her
eyelids
and
her
face
were
red
as
if
perpetually
smitten
by
the
east
wind
and
scarified
with
weeping
to
alice
at
the
piano
it
was
terrible
to
be
associated
with
the
song
of
the
young
lady
from
morfe
she
felt
that
rowcliffe
was
looking
at
her
he
was
and
she
strove
by
look
and
manner
to
detach
herself
as
the
young
lady
flung
herself
into
it
and
became
more
and
more
intolerably
arch
alice
became
more
and
more
severe
she
purified
the
accompaniment
from
all
taint
of
the
young
lady
intentions
it
grew
graver
and
graver
it
was
a
hymn
a
solemn
chant
a
dirge
the
dirge
of
the
last
hope
of
the
young
lady
from
morfe
when
it
ceased
there
rose
from
the
piano
that
was
its
grave
the
grande
polonaise
of
chopin
it
rose
in
splendor
and
defiance
defiance
of
the
young
lady
from
morfe
it
brought
down
the
schoolhouse
in
a
storm
of
clapping
and
thumping
of
bravos
and
encores
even
rowcliffe
said
bravo
but
alice
still
seated
at
the
piano
smiled
and
signaled
and
jim
greatorex
stood
up
to
sing
he
stood
facing
the
room
but
beside
her
so
that
she
could
sign
to
him
if
anything
went
wrong
that
we
were
down
the
stream
of
the
spring
breeze
like
children
with
greatorex
voice
was
a
voice
of
awful
volume
and
it
ranged
somewhere
from
fairly
deep
barytone
almost
to
tenor
it
was
at
moments
unmanageable
being
untrained
yet
he
seemed
to
do
as
much
with
it
as
if
it
had
been
bass
and
barytone
and
tenor
all
in
one
it
had
grown
a
little
thick
in
the
last
year
but
he
brought
out
of
its
very
thickness
a
brooding
yearning
passion
and
an
intolerable
pathos
the
song
overladen
with
emotion
appealed
to
him
it
expressed
as
nothing
else
could
have
expressed
the
passions
that
were
within
him
at
that
moment
it
swept
the
whole
range
of
his
experiences
there
were
sheep
in
it
and
a
churchyard
and
children
his
lady
could
never
be
anything
more
to
him
than
a
child
that
we
were
in
our
nest
in
the
sod
with
our
limbs
at
rest
on
the
quiet
earth
breast
and
our
souls
at
home
with
god
that
finished
it
there
was
no
other
end
and
as
he
sang
it
looking
nobly
if
a
little
heavily
over
the
heads
of
his
audience
he
saw
essy
gale
hidden
away
and
trying
to
hide
herself
more
beside
her
mother
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
room
he
had
forgotten
essy
and
at
the
sight
of
her
his
nobility
went
from
him
and
only
his
heaviness
remained
it
did
matter
that
they
shouted
for
him
to
sing
again
that
they
stamped
and
bellowed
and
that
he
did
sing
again
and
again
taking
the
roof
off
at
the
last
with
john
peel
nothing
mattered
nothing
mattered
nothing
could
matter
now
and
then
something
bigger
than
his
heart
bigger
than
his
voice
something
immense
and
brutal
and
defiant
asserted
itself
and
said
that
come
to
that
essy
did
matter
she
had
put
herself
in
his
way
and
maggie
had
been
before
and
after
her
and
maggie
did
matter
either
for
the
magical
smell
had
wrapped
itself
round
alice
cartaret
and
her
gown
and
eyes
and
round
the
thought
of
her
it
twined
and
tangled
her
in
the
subtle
mesh
she
was
held
and
embalmed
in
it
forever
xxvi
it
was
wednesday
the
day
after
the
concert
cartaret
was
standing
before
the
fire
in
his
study
he
had
just
rung
the
bell
and
now
he
waited
in
an
attitude
of
wisdom
and
of
patience
it
was
only
ten
in
the
morning
and
wisdom
and
patience
should
not
be
required
of
any
man
at
such
an
hour
but
the
vicar
had
a
disagreeable
duty
to
perform
whenever
the
vicar
had
a
disagreeable
duty
to
perform
he
performed
it
as
early
as
possible
in
the
morning
so
that
none
of
its
disagreeableness
was
lost
the
whole
day
was
poisoned
by
it
he
waited
a
little
longer
and
as
he
waited
his
patience
began
to
suffer
imperceptibly
though
his
wisdom
remained
intact
he
rang
again
the
bell
sounded
through
the
quiet
house
angry
and
terrifying
in
another
moment
essy
came
in
she
had
on
a
clean
apron
she
stood
by
the
desk
it
offered
her
a
certain
cover
and
support
her
brown
eyes
liquid
and
gentle
gazed
at
him
but
for
all
her
gentleness
there
was
a
touch
of
defiance
in
her
bearing
did
you
not
hear
me
ring
said
the
vicar
naw
sir
nothing
more
clear
and
pure
than
the
candor
of
essy
eyes
they
disconcerted
him
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
essy
you

why

sent

she
started
and
the
red
blood
rose
in
her
face
i
not

and
see
him
mr
cartaret
she
was
very
quiet
very
good
then
i
shall
pay
you
a
month
wages
and
you
will
go
on

it
was
then
that
her
mouth
trembled
so
that
her
eyes
shone
large
through
her
tears
i
was
gawn
to
staay
sir
to
be
a
trooble
i
sud
a
gien
nawtice
in
anoother
moonth
she
paused
there
was
a
spasm
in
her
throat
as
if
she
swallowed
with
difficulty
her
bitter
pride
her
voice
came
thick
and
hoarse
woa
yo
kape
me
till
th
and
o
t
moonth
sir
her
voice
cleared
suddenly
than
i
can
see
yo
trow
christmas
the
vicar
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
but
instead
of
speaking
he
stared
his
open
mouth
stared
with
a
supreme
astonishment
up
till
now
in
his
wisdom
and
his
patience
he
had
borne
with
essy
the
essy
who
had
come
before
him
one
evening
in
september
dejected
and
afraid
he
hated
essy
and
he
hated
her
sin
but
he
had
borne
with
her
then
because
of
her
sorrow
and
her
shame
and
here
was
essy
with
not
a
sign
of
sorrow
or
of
shame
about
her
offering
in
the
teeth
of
her
deserved
dismissal
actually
offering
as
a
favor
to
stay
over
christmas
and
to
see
them
through
the
naked
impudence
of
it
was
what
staggered
him
i
have
no
intention
of
keeping
you
over
christmas
you
will
take
your
notice
and
your
wages
from
and
you

no
i
should
think
of
taking
you
back
the
vicar
hid
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
leaned
forward
thrusting
his
face
toward
essy
as
he
spoke
i
afraid
my
girl
it
never
will
be
all
over
as
long
as
you
regard
your
sin
as
lightly
as
you
do
essy
did
not
see
the
vicar
face
thrust
toward
her
she
was
sidling
to
the
door
she
had
her
hand
on
the
doorknob
come
back
said
the
vicar
i

something

to
say
to
you
essy
came
no
nearer
she
remained
standing
by
the
door
who
is
the
man
essy
at
that
essy
face
began
to
shake
piteously
standing
by
the
door
she
cried
quietly
with
soft
sobs
neither
hiding
her
face
nor
drying
her
tears
as
they
came
you
had
better

said
the
vicar
i

she
shook
her
head
in
utter
helplessness
come
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
then
the
storm
burst
she
turned
her
tormented
face
to
him
a
clane
breast

then
said
the
vicar
i

my
hands
of

but
he
said
it
to
an
empty
room
essy
had
left
him
in
the
outer
room
the
three
sisters
sat
silent
and
motionless
their
faces
were
turned
toward
the
closed
door
of
the
study
they
were
listening
to
the
sounds
that
went
on
behind
it
the
burden
of
essy
hung
heavy
over
them
the
study
door
opened
and
shut
then
the
kitchen
door
poor
essy
said
gwenda
poor
essy
said
alice
she
was
sorry
for
essy
now
she
could
afford
to
be
sorry
for
her
mary
said
nothing
and
from
her
silence
you
could
not
tell
what
she
was
thinking
the
long
day
dragged
on
to
prayer
time
the
burden
of
essy
hung
heavy
over
the
whole
house
that
night
at
a
quarter
to
ten
fifteen
minutes
before
prayer
time
gwenda
came
to
her
father
in
his
study
papa
she
said
is
it
true
that
you
sacked
essy
at
three
notice
i
have
dismissed
essy
said
the
vicar
for
a
sufficient
reason
there
no
reason
to
turn
her
out
before
christmas
there
is
said
the
vicar
a
very
grave
reason
we
need
go
into
it
he
knew
that
his
daughter
knew
his
reason
but
he
ignored
her
knowledge
as
he
ignored
all
things
that
were
unpleasant
to
him
we
must
go
into
it
said
gwenda
it
a
sin
to
turn
her
out
at
three
days
notice
i
know
what
i
doing
gwenda
and
why
i
doing
it
so
do
i
we
all
do
none
of
us
want
her
to
go
yet
you
could
easily
have
kept
her
another
two
months
she
have
given
notice
herself
i
am
not
going
to
discuss
it
with
you
the
vicar
put
his
head
under
the
roll
top
of
his
desk
and
pretended
to
be
looking
for
papers
gwenda
seated
herself
familiarly
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
he
had
left
you
have
to
i
afraid
she
said
please
take
your
head
out
of
the
desk
papa
there
no
use
behaving
like
an
ostrich
i
can
see
you
all
the
time
the
trouble
is
you
know
that
you
wo
and
you
think
how
essy
going
to
do
without
those
two
wages
she
might
have
had
she
want
every
shilling
she
can
lay
her
hands
on
for
the
baby
she
should
have
thought
of
that
before
the
vicar
was
answering
himself
he
did
not
acknowledge
his
right
to
discuss
essy
she
think
of
it
presently
said
gwenda
in
her
unblushing
calm
look
here
papa
while
you
trying
how
you
can
make
this
awful
thing
more
awful
for
her
what
do
you
think
poor
essy
bothering
about
she
not
bothering
about
her
sin
nor
about
her
baby
bothering
about
how
she
landed
the
vicar
closed
his
eyes
his
patience
was
exhausted
so
was
his
wisdom
i
am
not
arguing
with
you
gwenda
you
ca
you
know
perfectly
well
what
a
beastly
shame
it
is
that
roused
him
you
seem
to
think
no
more
of
essy
sin
than
essy
does
how
do
you
know
what
essy
thinks
how
do
i
know
it
is
any
business
of
ours
what
essy
thinks
it
what
we
do
i
rather
do
what
essy
done
any
day
than
do
mean
or
cruel
things
would
you
the
vicar
raised
his
eyebrows
and
his
shoulders
it
was
the
gesture
of
a
man
helpless
before
the
unspeakable
he
took
refuge
in
his
pathos
i
am
very
tired
gwenda
and
it
ten
minutes
to
ten
it
may
have
been
because
the
vicar
was
tired
that
his
mind
wandered
somewhat
that
night
during
family
prayers
foremost
among
the
many
things
that
the
vicar
mind
refused
to
consider
was
the
question
of
the
status
of
the
very
existence
of
family
prayers
in
his
household
but
for
essy
though
the
vicar
did
not
know
it
it
was
doubtful
whether
family
prayers
would
have
survived
what
he
called
his
daughters
godlessness
mary
to
be
sure
conformed
outwardly
she
was
not
easily
irritated
and
as
she
put
it
she
did
not
really
prayers
but
to
alice
and
gwendolen
prayers
were
a
weariness
and
an
exasperation
alice
would
evade
them
under
any
pretext
by
her
father
action
in
transporting
her
to
gardale
she
considered
that
she
was
absolved
from
her
filial
allegiance
but
gwendolen
was
loyal
in
the
matter
of
prayers
which
she
made
it
perfectly
clear
to
alice
and
mary
could
not
possibly
annoy
them
more
than
they
did
her
she
was
going
to
see
papa
through
it
would
be
beastly
she
said
not
to
they
could
give
him
away
before
essy
but
of
the
clemency
and
generosity
of
gwendolen
attitude
cartaret
was
not
aware
he
believed
that
the
custom
of
prayers
was
maintained
in
his
household
by
his
inflexible
authority
and
will
he
gloried
in
them
as
an
expression
of
his
power
they
were
a
form
of
coercion
which
it
seemed
he
could
apply
quite
successfully
to
his
womenkind
those
creatures
of
his
flesh
and
blood
yet
so
alien
and
intractable
family
prayers
gave
him
a
keener
spiritual
satisfaction
than
the
church
services
in
which
outwardly
he
cut
a
far
more
imposing
figure
in
a
countryside
peopled
mainly
by
abominable
wesleyans
and
impure
baptists
cartaret
spoke
and
thought
of
wesleyans
and
baptists
as
if
they
were
abominable
and
impure
pure
he
had
some
difficulty
in
procuring
a
congregation
the
few
who
came
to
the
parish
church
came
because
it
was
respectable
and
therefore
profitable
or
because
they
had
got
into
the
habit
and
could
well
get
out
of
it
or
because
they
liked
it
not
at
all
because
his
will
and
his
authority
compelled
them
but
to
emerge
from
his
study
inevitably
at
ten
an
hour
when
the
souls
of
mary
and
gwendolen
and
alice
were
most
reluctant
and
most
hostile
to
the
thought
of
prayers
and
by
sheer
worrying
to
round
up
the
fugitives
whatever
they
happened
to
be
doing
and
wherever
they
happened
to
be
this
though
he
said
it
was
no
pleasure
to
him
was
more
agreeable
to
cartaret
than
he
knew
the
very
fact
that
essy
was
a
wesleyan
and
so
far
an
unwilling
conformist
gave
a
peculiar
zest
to
the
performance
it
was
always
the
same
it
started
with
a
look
through
his
glasses
leveled
at
each
member
of
his
household
in
turn
as
if
he
desired
to
satisfy
himself
as
to
the
expression
of
their
faces
while
at
the
same
time
he
defied
them
to
protest
for
the
rest
his
rule
was
that
of
his
father
the
schoolmaster
before
him
first
a
chapter
from
the
bible
the
old
testament
in
the
morning
the
new
testament
in
the
evening
working
straight
through
from
genesis
to
revelation
omitting
leviticus
as
somewhat
unsuitable
for
family
reading
then
prayers
proper
beginning
with
what
his
daughter
gwendolen
seventeen
years
ago
had
called
fancy
prayers
otherwise
prayers
not
lifted
from
the
liturgy
but
compiled
and
composed
in
accordance
with
the
freer
evangelical
taste
in
prayers
then
for
both
cartaret
and
the
schoolmaster
his
father
held
that
the
church
must
not
be
ignored
there
followed
last
sunday
collect
the
collect
for
grace
the
benediction
and
the
lord
prayer
now
as
his
rule
would
have
it
that
evening
of
the
fifth
of
december
brought
him
to
the
eighth
chapter
of
john
in
the
one
concerning
the
woman
taken
in
adultery
which
was
the
very
last
chapter
which
cartaret
that
evening
could
have
desired
to
read
he
had
always
considered
that
to
some
minds
it
might
be
open
to
misinterpretation
as
a
defense
of
laxity
where
are
those
thine
accusers
hath
no
man
condemned
thee
she
said
man
lord
and
jesus
said
unto
her
do
i
condemn
thee
cartaret
lowered
his
voice
and
his
eyes
as
he
read
for
he
felt
gwendolen
eyes
upon
him
but
he
recovered
himself
on
the
final
charge
now
he
came
to
think
of
it
that
was
what
he
had
said
to
essy
sin
no
more
after
all
he
was
supported
casting
another
and
more
decidedly
uneasy
glance
at
his
family
he
knelt
down
he
felt
better
when
they
were
all
kneeling
for
now
he
had
their
backs
toward
him
instead
of
their
faces
he
then
prayed
on
behalf
of
himself
and
essy
and
his
family
he
prayed
to
a
god
who
so
he
assumed
his
godhead
was
ever
more
ready
to
hear
than
they
to
pray
a
god
whom
he
congratulated
on
his
ability
to
perform
for
them
far
more
than
they
either
desired
or
deserved
he
thanked
him
for
having
mercifully
preserved
them
to
the
close
of
another
blessed
day
as
in
the
morning
he
would
thank
him
for
having
spared
them
to
see
the
light
of
another
blessed
day
he
besought
him
to
pardon
anything
which
that
day
they
had
done
amiss
to
deliver
them
from
disobedience
and
from
pride
and
waywardness
he
had
inserted
this
clause
ten
years
ago
for
gwendolen
benefit
as
well
as
from
the
sins
that
did
most
easily
beset
them
for
the
temptations
to
which
they
were
especially
prone
this
clause
covered
all
the
things
he
could
mention
it
covered
his
wife
robina
case
it
covered
essy
he
had
dragged
alice
case
as
it
were
from
under
it
he
had
a
secret
fear
that
one
day
it
might
cover
gwendolen
gwendolen
was
the
child
who
he
declared
and
believed
had
always
given
him
most
trouble
he
recalled
perversely
a
certain
thing
that
at
thirteen
she
had
said
about
this
prayer
it
ought
to
be
prayed
she
had
said
you
do
really
think
you
can
fool
god
that
way
papa
if
i
had
a
servant
who
groveled
to
me
like
that
i
tell
him
he
must
learn
to
keep
his
chin
up
or
go
she
had
said
it
before
robina
who
had
laughed
and
answer
to
it
had
been
to
turn
his
back
on
both
of
them
and
leave
the
room
at
least
he
thought
it
was
his
answer
gwendolen
had
thought
that
in
a
flash
of
intellectual
honesty
he
agreed
with
her
only
that
he
had
quite
enough
honesty
to
say
so
before
mummy
all
this
he
recalled
and
the
question
she
had
pursued
him
with
about
that
time
are
the
sins
that
do
most
easily
beset
us
are
the
temptations
to
which
we
are
especially
prone
and
his
own
evasive
answer
ask
yourself
my
child
another
year
and
she
had
left
off
asking
him
questions
she
drew
back
into
herself
and
became
every
day
more
more
solitary
more
inaccessible
and
now
if
he
could
have
seen
things
as
they
really
were
cartaret
would
have
perceived
that
he
was
afraid
of
gwenda
as
it
was
he
thought
he
was
only
afraid
of
what
gwenda
might
do
alice
was
capable
of
some
things
but
gwenda
was
capable
of
anything
suddenly
to
gwenda
surprise
her
father
sighed
a
dislocating
sigh
it
came
between
the
benediction
and
the
lord
prayer
for
even
as
he
invoked
the
blessing
cartaret
suddenly
felt
sorry
for
himself
again
his
children
were
no
good
to
him
by
which
he
meant
that
his
third
wife
robina
was
no
good
but
he
did
not
know
that
he
visited
his
wife
shortcomings
on
their
heads
any
more
than
he
knew
that
he
hated
essy
and
her
sin
because
he
himself
was
an
enforced
reluctant
celibate
xxvii
the
next
day
at
dusk
essy
gale
slipped
out
to
her
mother
cottage
down
by
the
beck
gale
had
just
cleared
the
table
after
her
tea
had
washed
up

and
was
putting

away
in
the
cupboard
when
essy
entered
she
looked

sharply
inimically
essy

doorway
shamefaced
moother

struck
an
attitude
of
astonishment
and
fear
although
she
had
expected
essy
to
come

such
an
hour
and
with
such
a
look

only

last
possible
moment
and
up
to
the
last
possible
moment
even
to
her

snatched

she
returned
stamping
and
set
it
with
violence
upon

fire
she
tore
out
of
the
cupboard
a
teapot
a
cup
and
a
saucer
a
loaf
on
a
plate
and
a
jar
of
dripping
still
with
violence
slightly
modulated
to

with

and
the

on

revolted
by
the
sight
of
her

she
turned
from
her
and
left
the
kitchen
by
the
staircase
door
her
ponderous
stamping
could
be
heard
going
up
the
staircase
and
on
the
floor
overhead
there
was
a
sound
as
of
drawers
opening
and
shutting
and
of
a
heavy
box
being
dragged
from
under
the
bed
essy
poured
herself
out
a
cup
of
tea
tried
to
drink
it
choked
and
pushed
it
from

she
was
still
weeping
when
her
mother
came
to
her
gale
came
softly
all
alone
in
the
room
overhead
she
had
evidently
been
doing
something
that
had
pleased
her
the
ghost
of
a
smile
still
haunted
her
bleak
face
she
carried
on
her
arm
tenderly
a
pile
of
little
garments
these
she
began
to
spread
out
on
the
table

removed

profoundly
disturbed

resentful

and
shut

up
with

in
the
scullery
essy
staggering
rose
and
dried
her
eyes
for
a
moment
or
so
she
stared
idly
at

square
window
with
the
night
behind
it
then
she
looked
down
she
smiled
faintly
one
by
one
she
took
the
little
garments
spread
out
in

of
her
she
folded
them
in
a
pile
her

was
still
and
dreamy
she
opened

and
looked
in

assy
it
was
striking
seven
as
she
passed
the
church
above
the
strokes
of
the
hour
she
heard
through
the
door
a
sound
of
organ
playing
and
of
a
big
voice
singing
and
she
began
to
weep
again
she
knew
the
singer
and
the
player

xxviii
christmas
was
over
and
gone
it
was
the
last
week
in
january
all
through
december
rowcliffe
visits
to
the
vicarage
had
continued
but
in
january
they
ceased
that
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
even
ally
could
wonder
there
was
influenza
in
every
other
house
in
the
dale
then
one
day
gwenda
walking
past
upthorne
heard
wheels
behind
her
and
the
clanking
hoofs
of
the
doctor
horse
she
knew
what
would
happen
rowcliffe
would
pull
up
a
yard
or
two
in
front
of
her
he
would
ask
her
where
she
was
going
and
he
would
make
her
drive
with
him
over
the
moor
and
she
knew
that
she
would
go
with
him
she
would
not
be
able
to
refuse
him
but
the
clanking
hoofs
went
by
and
never
stopped
there
were
two
men
in
the
trap
acroyd
rowcliffe
groom
sat
in
rowcliffe
place
driving
he
touched
his
hat
to
her
as
he
passed
her
beside
him
there
was
a
strange
man
she
said
to
herself
he
away
then
i
think
he
might
have
told
me
and
ally
passing
through
the
village
had
seen
the
strange
man
too
rowcliffe
must
be
away
she
said
at
i
wonder
if
be
back
by
wednesday
wednesday

last

the
strange
man

his
place
in
the
surgery

the
news
into
the
vicarage
at
four
she
had
taken
her
daughter
place
for
the
time

she
was
a
just
woman
and
she
bore
no
grudge
against
the
vicar
on
essy
account
he
had
done
no
more
than
he
was
obliged
to
do
essy

a
month

had
worked

working
double
to
make
up
for
it

the
innocence
of
her

she
ceased
she
gazed
upon
both
the
sisters
now
alice
her
face
white
and
averted
shrank
back
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
gwenda
face
was
still
neither
of
them
had
spoken
mary
had
tea
alone
that
afternoon
alice
had
dragged
herself
upstairs
to
her
bedroom
and
locked
herself
in
she
had
flung
herself
face
downward
on
her
bed
she
lay
there
while
the
room
grew
gray
and
darkened
suddenly
she
passed
from
a
violent
fit
of
writhing
and
of
weeping
into
blank
and
motionless
collapses
from
time
to
time
she
hiccoughed
helplessly
but
in
the
moment
before
mary
came
downstairs
gwenda
had
slipped
on
the
rough
coat
that
hung
on
its
peg
in
the
passage
her
hat
was
lying
about
somewhere
in
the
room
where
alice
had
locked
herself
in
she
went
out
bareheaded
there
was
a
movement
in
the
little
group
of
villagers
gathered
on
the
bridge
before
the
surgery
door
they
slunk
together
and
turned
their
backs
on
her
as
she
passed
they
knew
where
she
was
going
as
well
as
she
did
and
she
did
care
she
was
doing
the
sort
of
thing
that
alice
had
done
and
had
suffered
for
doing
she
knew
it
and
she
did
care
it
did
matter
what
alice
had
done
or
ever
would
do
it
did
matter
what
she
did
herself
it
was
quite
simple
nothing
mattered
to
her
so
long
as
rowcliffe
lived
and
if
he
died
nothing
would
ever
matter
to
her
again
for
she
knew
now
what
it
was
that
had
happened
to
her
she
could
no
longer
humbug
herself
into
insisting
that
it
had
happened
the
thing
had
been
secret
and
treacherous
with
her
and
she
had
been
secret
and
treacherous
with
it
she
had
refused
to
acknowledge
it
not
because
she
had
been
ashamed
of
it
but
because
with
the
dreadful
instance
of
alice
before
her
eyes
she
had
been
afraid
she
had
been
afraid
of
how
it
would
appear
to
rowcliffe
he
might
see
in
it
something
morbid
and
perverted
something
horribly
like
ally
she
went
in
terror
of
the
taint
where
it
should
have
held
its
head
up
defiantly
and
beautifully
it
had
been
beaten
back
it
cowered
and
skulked
in
the
dark
places
and
waited
for
its
hour
and
now
that
it
showed
itself
naked
unveiled
unarmed
superbly
defenseless
her
terror
of
it
ceased
it
had
received
a
sanction
that
had
been
withheld
from
it
before
until
half
an
hour
ago
she
was
aware
of
it
there
had
been
something
lacking
in
her
feeling
mary
and
ally
this
she
was
not
aware
of
got
more
out
of
rowcliffe
so
to
speak
than
she
did
gwenda
had
known
nothing
approaching
to
mary
serene
and
brooding
satisfaction
or
ally
ecstasy
she
dreaded
the
secret
gates
the
dreamy
labyrinths
the
poisonous
air
of
the
paradise
of
fools
in
rowcliffe
presence
she
had
not
felt
altogether
safe
or
altogether
happy
but
if
she
stood
on
the
edge
of
an
abyss
at
least
she
there
firm
on
the
solid
earth
she
could
balance
herself
she
could
even
lean
forward
a
little
and
look
over
without
losing
her
head
thrilled
with
the
uncertainty
and
peril
of
the
adventure
and
of
course
it
was
as
if
rowcliffe
had
left
her
standing
he
had
he
had
held
out
his
hand
to
her
as
it
were
and
said
let
get
on
get
on
which
was
as
good
as
saying
that
as
long
as
it
lasted
it
was
adventure
not
hers
he
had
drawn
her
after
him
at
an
exciting
pace
along
the
edge
of
the
abyss
never
losing
head
for
a
minute
so
that
she
ought
to
have
felt
safe
with
him
only
she
had
she
had
said
to
herself
if
i
knew
him
better
if
i
saw
what
was
in
him
perhaps
i
should
feel
safe
there
was
something
she
wanted
to
see
in
him
something
that
her
innermost
secret
self
fastidious
and
exacting
demanded
from
him
before
it
would
loosen
the
grip
that
held
her
back
and
now
she
knew
that
it
there
it
had
been
told
her
in
four
words
he
never
saved
himself
she
might
have
known
it
for
she
remembered
things
now
how
he
had
nursed
old
greatorex
like
a
woman
how
he
had
sat
up
half
the
night
with
jim
greatorex
mare
daisy
how
he
kept
jim
greatorex
from
drinking
and
how
he
had
been
kind
to
poor
essy
when
she
had
the
face
ache
and
gentle
to
little
ally
and
now
ned
alderson
ridiculous
baby
would
live
and
rowcliffe
would
die
was
what
she
had
required
of
him
she
felt
as
if
somehow
had
done
it
as
if
her
innermost
secret
self
iniquitously
exacting
had
thrown
down
the
gage
into
the
arena
and
that
he
had
picked
it
up
he
saved
others
himself
he
never
saved
he
had
become
to
her
and
the
passion
she
had
trampled
on
lifted
itself
and
passed
into
the
phase
of
adoration
it
had
received
the
dangerous
sanction
of
the
soul
she
turned
off
the
high
road
at
the
point
where
three
months
ago
she
had
seen
mary
cycling
up
the
hill
from
morfe
now
as
then
she
descended
upon
morfe
by
the
stony
lane
from
the
moor
below
karva
it
came
over
her
that
she
was
too
late
that
she
would
see
rows
of
yellow
blinds
drawn
down
in
the
long
front
of
rowcliffe
house
the
blinds
were
up
the
windows
looked
upon
the
green
she
noticed
that
one
of
them
on
the
first
floor
was
half
open
and
she
said
to
herself
he
is
up
there
in
that
room
dying
of
diphtheria
the
sound
of
the
bell
muffled
funereally
at
the
back
of
the
house
fulfilled
her
premonition
the
door
opened
wide
the
maid
stood
back
from
it
to
let
her
pass
in
how
is
dr
rowcliffe
her
voice
sounded
abrupt
and
brutal
as
it
tore
its
way
from
her
tense
throat
the
maid
raised
her
eyebrows
she
held
the
door
wider
would
you
like
to
see
him
miss
yes
her
throat
closed
on
the
word
and
choked
it
down
at
the
end
of
the
passage
where
it
was
dark
a
door
opened
the
door
of
the
surgery
and
a
man
came
out
went
in
as
if
to
look
for
something
and
came
out
again
as
he
moved
there
in
the
darkness
she
thought
it
was
the
strange
doctor
and
that
he
had
come
out
to
forbid
her
seeing
rowcliffe
he
would
say
that
she
must
risk
the
infection
as
if
she
cared
about
the
risk
perhaps
he
would
see
her
he
too
might
say
she
must
risk
it
while
the
surgery
door
opened
and
shut
opened
and
shut
again
she
saw
that
her
seems
him
was
of
all
things
the
most
unlikely
she
remembered
the
house
at
upthorne
and
she
knew
that
rowcliffe
was
lying
dead
in
the
room
upstairs
and
the
man
there
was
coming
out
to
stop
her
only
in
that
case
why
had
they
drawn
the
blinds
down
xxix
she
was
still
thinking
of
the
blinds
when
she
saw
that
the
man
who
came
towards
her
was
rowcliffe
he
was
wearing
his
rough
tweed
suit
and
his
thick
boots
and
he
had
the
look
of
the
open
air
about
him
is
that
you
miss
cartaret
good
he
grasped
her
hand
he
behaved
exactly
as
if
he
had
expected
her
he
never
even
wondered
what
she
had
come
for
she
might
have
come
to
say
that
her
father
or
one
of
her
sisters
was
dying
and
would
he
go
at
once
but
none
of
these
possibilities
occurred
to
him
he
did
want
to
account
for
her
coming
to
him
it
was
natural
and
beautiful
that
she
should
come
then
as
she
stepped
into
the
lighted
passage
he
saw
that
she
was
bareheaded
and
that
her
eyelashes
were
parted
and
gathered
into
little
wet
points
he
took
her
arm
gently
and
led
her
into
his
study
and
shut
the
door
they
faced
each
other
there
i
say
is
anything
wrong
i
thought
you
were
she
had
grasped
the
absurdity
of
it
yet
she
was
still
under
the
spell
of
the
illusion
i
ill
good
heavens
no
they
told
me
in
the
village
you
got
diphtheria
and
i
came
to
know
if
it
was
true
it
true
he
smiled
an
odd
little
embarrassed
smile
almost
as
if
he
were
owning
that
it
was
or
had
been
true
it
she
persisted
as
he
went
on
smiling
of
course
it
is
she
frowned
as
if
she
were
annoyed
with
him
for
not
being
then
what
was
that
other
man
here
for
harker
oh
he
just
took
my
place
for
a
day
or
two
while
i
had
a
sore
throat
you
a
throat
then
thus
she
accused
him
and
you
sit
up
for
three
nights
with
ned
alderson
baby
she
defied
him
to
deny
it
that
nothing
anybody
would
i
had
to
and
you
saved
the
baby
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
do
know
some
thing
or
other
pulled
the
little
beggar
through
and
you
might
have
got
it
i
might
but
i
did
you
get
a
throat
and
it
have
been
diphtheria
thus
by
accusing
him
she
endeavored
to
justify
herself
it
might
he
said
but
it
was
i
had
to
knock
off
work
till
i
was
sure
and
you
sure
now
i
can
tell
you
would
be
here
if
i
was
and
they
told
me
you
were
dying
she
was
utterly
disgusted
at
that
he
laughed
aloud
an
irresistible
extravagantly
delighted
laugh
when
he
stopped
he
choked
and
began
all
over
again
the
idea
of
his
dying
was
so
funny
so
was
her
disgust
that
she
said
was
why
i
came
then
i
glad
they
told
you
i
not
said
she
he
laughed
again
at
her
sudden
funny
dignity
then
as
suddenly
he
was
grave
i
say
it
nice
of
you
she
held
out
her
hand
and
now
as
you
not
dead
i
off
oh
no
you
not
you
going
to
stay
and
have
tea
and
i
going
to
walk
back
with
you
she
stayed
they
walked
over
the
moor
by
karva
and
as
they
went
he
talked
to
her
as
he
had
talked
before
it
was
all
about
himself
and
his
tone
was
very
serious
he
talked
about
his
work
and
with
considerable
reservations
and
omissions
about
his
life
in
leeds
and
about
his
ambition
he
told
her
what
he
had
done
and
why
he
had
done
it
and
what
he
was
going
to
do
he
was
going
to
stay
in
garthdale
all
his
life
not
he
presently
he
would
want
to
get
to
the
center
of
things
he
forgot
to
mention
that
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
thought
of
it
nothing
would
satisfy
him
but
a
big
london
practice
and
a
name
he
might
ultimately
specialise
if
he
did
he
rather
thought
it
would
be
gynæcology
he
was
interested
in
women
cases
or
it
might
be
nervous
diseases
he
was
sure
anyhow
it
must
be
something
big
for
under
gwenda
cartaret
eyes
his
romantic
youth
became
fiery
and
turbulent
inside
him
it
not
only
urged
him
to
tremendous
heights
it
made
him
actually
feel
that
he
would
reach
them
for
a
solid
of
an
hour
walking
over
the
moor
by
karva
he
had
ceased
to
be
one
of
the
obscurest
of
obscure
little
country
doctors
he
was
sir
steven
rowcliffe
the
great
gynæcologist
or
the
great
neurologist
as
the
case
might
be
with
a
row
of
letters
after
his
name
and
a
whole
column
under
it
in
the
medical
directory
and
gwenda
cartaret
eyes
never
for
a
moment
contradicted
him
they
agreed
with
every
one
of
his
preposterous
statements
she
did
know
that
it
was
only
his
romantic
youth
and
that
he
never
had
been
and
never
would
be
more
youthful
than
he
was
for
that
of
an
hour
on
the
contrary
to
youth
he
seemed
to
have
left
youth
behind
him
and
to
have
grown
suddenly
serious
and
and
mature
and
then
he
stopped
right
on
the
moor
as
if
he
were
suddenly
aware
of
his
absurdity
i
say
he
said
what
must
you
think
of
me
gassing
about
myself
like
that
i
think
she
said
it
awfully
nice
of
you
i
do
suppose
i
shall
do
anything
really
big
do
you
she
was
silent
honestly
now
do
you
think
i
shall
i
think
the
things
you
done
already
the
things
that
never
be
heard
of
are
really
big
his
silence
said
they
are
not
enough
for
me
and
hers
for
me
they
are
enough
but
the
other
things
he
insisted
the
things
i
want
to
do
do
you
think
i
do
them
i
think
she
said
slowly
in
fact
i
certain
that
you
do
them
if
you
really
mean
to
that
what
you
think
of
me
that
what
i
think
of
you
then
it
all
right
he
said
for
what
i
think
of
is
that
you
never
say
a
thing
you
did
really
mean
they
parted
at
the
turn
of
the
road
where
as
he
again
reminded
her
he
had
seen
her
first
going
home
by
himself
over
the
moor
rowcliffe
wondered
whether
he
had
missed
his
opportunity
he
might
have
told
her
that
he
cared
for
her
he
might
have
asked
her
if
she
cared
if
he
had
it
was
only
because
there
was
no
need
to
be
precipitate
he
felt
rather
than
knew
that
she
was
sure
of
him
plenty
of
time
plenty
of
time
he
was
so
sure
of
xxx
plenty
of
time
the
last
week
of
january
passed
through
the
first
weeks
of
february
rowcliffe
was
kept
busy
for
sickness
was
still
in
the
dale
whether
he
required
it
or
not
rowcliffe
had
a
respite
from
decision
no
opportunity
arose
if
he
looked
in
at
the
vicarage
on
wednesdays
it
was
to
drink
a
cup
of
tea
in
a
hurry
while
his
man
put
his
horse
in
the
trap
he
took
his
man
with
him
now
on
his
longer
rounds
to
save
time
and
trouble
once
in
a
while
he
would
meet
gwenda
cartaret
or
overtake
her
on
some
road
miles
from
garth
and
he
would
make
her
get
up
and
drive
on
with
him
or
he
would
give
her
a
lift
home
it
pleased
her
to
be
taken
up
and
driven
she
liked
the
rapid
motion
and
the
ways
of
the
little
brown
horse
she
even
loved
the
noise
he
made
with
his
clanking
hoofs
rowcliffe
said
it
was
a
beastly
trick
he
made
up
his
mind
about
once
a
week
that
he
get
rid
of
him
but
somehow
he
could
he
was
fond
of
the
little
brown
horse
he
had
him
so
long
and
she
said
to
herself
he
faithful
then
of
course
he
would
be
it
was
almost
as
if
he
had
wanted
her
to
know
it
then
april
came
and
the
long
spring
twilights
the
sick
people
had
got
well
rowcliffe
had
whole
hours
on
his
hands
that
he
could
have
spent
with
gwenda
now
if
he
had
known
and
as
yet
he
did
not
altogether
know
there
was
something
about
gwenda
cartaret
for
which
rowcliffe
with
all
his
sureness
and
all
his
experience
was
unprepared
their
whole
communion
rested
and
proceeded
on
undeclared
unacknowledged
unrealised
assumptions
and
it
was
somehow
its
very
secrecy
that
made
it
so
secure
rather
than
put
it
to
the
test
he
was
content
to
leave
their
meetings
to
luck
and
his
own
imperfect
ingenuity
he
knew
where
and
at
what
times
he
would
have
the
best
chance
of
finding
her
sometimes
returning
from
his
northerly
rounds
he
would
send
the
trap
on
and
walk
back
to
morfe
by
karva
on
the
chance
once
when
the
moon
was
up
he
sighted
her
on
the
farther
moors
beyond
upthorne
when
he
got
down
and
walked
with
her
for
miles
while
his
man
and
the
trap
waited
for
him
in
garth
once
and
only
once
driving
by
himself
on
the
rathdale
moors
beyond
morfe
he
overtook
her
picked
her
up
and
drove
her
through
morfe
to
the
consternation
of
its
inhabitants
all
the
way
to
garth
and
to
the
very
gate
of
the
vicarage
but
that
was
reckless
and
in
all
those
hours
for
his
opportunities
counted
by
hours
now
he
had
never
found
his
moment
there
was
plenty
of
time
and
their
isolation
his
and
hers
in
garthdale
left
him
dangerously
secure
all
the
same
by
april
rowcliffe
was
definitely
looking
for
the
moment
the
one
shining
moment
that
must
sooner
or
later
come
it
was
indeed
always
coming
over
and
over
again
he
had
caught
sight
of
it
it
signaled
shining
he
had
been
ready
to
seize
it
when
something
happened
something
obscured
it
something
put
him
off
he
never
knew
what
it
was
at
the
time
but
when
he
looked
back
on
these
happenings
he
discovered
that
it
was
always
something
that
gwenda
cartaret
did
you
would
have
said
that
no
scene
on
earth
could
have
been
more
favorable
to
a
lover
enterprise
than
these
long
deserted
roads
and
the
vast
twilit
moors
and
that
a
young
woman
could
have
found
nothing
to
distract
her
from
her
lover
there
but
it
was
not
so
on
the
open
moors
as
often
as
not
they
had
to
go
single
file
through
the
heather
along
a
narrow
sheep
track
rowcliffe
leading
and
it
is
difficult
not
to
say
impossible
to
command
the
attention
of
a
young
woman
walking
in
your
rear
and
a
thousand
things
distracted
gwenda
the
cry
of
a
mountain
sheep
the
sound
and
sight
of
a
stream
the
whirr
of
dark
wings
and
the
sudden
of
the
grouse
shooting
up
from
the
heather
and
on
the
high
roads
where
they
went
abreast
she
was
apt
to
be
carried
away
by
the
pageant
of
earth
and
sky
the
solid
darkness
that
came
up
from
the
moor
the
gray
aerial
abysses
of
the
dale
the
awful
blank
withdrawal
of
greffington
edge
into
the
night
she
was
off
heaven
knew
where
at
the
lighting
of
a
star
in
the
thin
blue
the
movement
of
a
cloud
excited
her
or
she
was
held
enchanted
by
the
pale
aura
of
moonrise
along
the
rampart
of
greffington
edge
she
shared
the
earth
silence
and
the
throbbing
passion
of
the
earth
as
the
orbed
moon
swung
free
and
in
her
absorption
her
estranging
ecstasy
rowcliffe
at
last
found
something
inimical
he
told
himself
that
it
was
an
affectation
in
her
or
a
lure
to
draw
him
after
her
as
it
would
have
been
in
any
other
woman
the
little
nurse
would
have
known
how
to
turn
the
earth
and
the
moon
to
her
own
purposes
and
his
but
all
the
time
he
knew
that
it
was
not
so
there
was
no
purpose
in
it
at
all
and
it
was
unaware
of
him
and
of
his
purposes
gwenda
joy
was
pure
and
profound
and
sufficient
to
itself
he
gathered
that
it
had
been
with
her
before
he
came
and
that
it
would
remain
with
her
after
he
had
gone
he
hated
to
think
that
she
should
know
any
joy
that
had
not
its
beginning
and
its
end
in
him
it
took
her
from
him
as
long
as
it
lasted
he
was
faced
with
an
incomprehensible
and
monstrous
rivalry
and
as
a
man
might
leave
a
woman
to
his
uninteresting
rival
in
the
certainty
that
she
will
be
bored
and
presently
return
to
him
rowcliffe
left
gwenda
to
the
earth
and
moon
he
sulked
and
was
silent
then
suddenly
he
made
up
his
mind
xxxi
it
was
one
night
in
april
he
had
met
her
at
the
crossroads
on
morfe
green
and
walked
home
with
her
by
the
edge
of
the
moor
it
had
blown
hard
all
day
and
now
the
wind
had
dropped
but
it
had
left
darkness
and
commotion
in
the
sky
the
west
was
a
solid
mass
of
cloud
that
drifted
slowly
in
the
wake
of
the
departing
storm
its
hindmost
part
shredded
to
mist
before
the
path
of
the
hidden
moon
for
mercifully
the
moon
was
hidden
rowcliffe
knew
his
moment
he
meditated
the
fraction
of
a
second
too
long
i
wonder
he
began
just
then
the
rear
of
the
cloud
opened
and
cast
out
the
moon
sheeted
in
the
white
mist
that
she
had
torn
from
it
and
then
before
he
knew
where
he
was
he
was
quarreling
with
gwenda
oh
look
at
the
moon
she
cried
all
bowed
forward
with
the
cloud
wrapped
round
her
head
something
calling
her
across
the
sky
but
the
mist
holds
her
and
the
wind
beats
her
back
look
how
she
staggers
and
charges
she
fighting
the
wind
and
she
goes
she
goes
she
does
go
said
rowcliffe
at
least
you
ca
see
her
going
and
the
cloud
is
wrapped
round
her
head
it
nowhere
near
her
and
the
wind
is
driving
her
it
driving
the
cloud
on
it
the
cloud
that
going
why
ca
you
see
things
as
they
are
she
was
detestable
to
him
in
that
moment
because
nobody
sees
them
as
they
are
and
you
spoiling
the
idea
the
idea
being
so
much
more
valuable
than
the
truth
he
longed
to
say
cruel
and
biting
things
to
her
it
is
valuable
to
anybody
but
me
so
you
might
have
left
it
to
me
oh
i
leave
it
to
you
if
you
in
love
with
it
i
not
in
love
with
it
because
it
mine
anyhow
if
i
in
love
i
in
love
with
the
moon
and
not
with
my
idea
of
the
moon
you
do
know
how
to
be
in
love
with
anything
even
the
moon
but
i
suppose
it
all
right
as
long
as
you
happy
of
course
i
happy
why
should
i
be
because
you
have
got
anything
to
make
you
happy
oh
have
i
you
might
have
but
you
have
you
too
obstinate
to
be
happy
but
i
just
told
you
that
i
happy
what
have
you
he
persisted
i
got
heaps
of
things
i
got
my
two
hands
and
my
two
feet
got
my
brain
so
have
i
and
yet
it
absurd
to
say
i
these
things
they
me
happiness
is
in
the
things
you
got
it
either
in
you
or
it
is
it
generally
is
go
on
what
else
you
got
the
moon
and
your
idea
of
the
moon
i
do
see
that
you
got
much
more
anyhow
i
got
my
liberty
your
liberty
if
that
all
you
want
it
pretty
nearly
all
it
covers
most
things
it
does
if
you
an
incurable
egoist
you
think
i
an
egoist
and
incurable
it
does
matter
what
i
think
not
much
if
you
think
that
silence
and
then
rowcliffe
burst
out
again
there
are
two
things
that
i
ca
stand
a
woman
nursing
a
dog
and
a
woman
in
love
with
the
moon
they
mean
the
same
thing
and
horrible
why
because
if
it
humbug
she
a
hypocrite
and
if
it
genuine
she
a
monster
and
if
i
in
love
with
the
moon
and
you
said
i
was
i
did
you
said
it
yourself
not
at
all
i
said
i
was
in
love
with
the
moon
i
be
in
love
with
and
not
with
my
idea
of
it
i
want
reality
so
do
i
we
not
likely
to
get
it
if
we
ca
see
it
no
if
you
only
in
love
with
what
you
see
oh
you
too
clever
too
clever
for
me
am
i
too
clever
for
myself
probably
he
laughed
abominably
i
do
see
the
joke
if
you
do
see
it
this
minute
you
see
it
in
another
ten
years
now
she
said
you
too
clever
for
they
walked
on
in
silence
again
the
mist
gathered
and
dripped
about
them
abruptly
she
spoke
has
anything
happened
no
it
has
i
mean
anything
horrid
her
voice
sounded
such
genuine
distress
that
he
dropped
his
hostile
and
contemptuous
tone
no
he
said
why
should
it
because
i
noticed
that
when
people
are
unusually
horrid
it
always
means
that
something
horrid
happened
to
them
really
papa
for
instance
is
only
horrid
to
us
because
mummy
my
stepmother
you
know
was
horrid
to
him
what
did
mummy
do
to
him
she
ran
away
from
him
it
always
that
way
people
are
horrid
on
purpose
at
least
i
sure
would
be
i
horrid
well
for
the
last
you
see
i
find
you
a
little
exasperating
at
times
not
always
no
not
by
any
means
always
can
i
tell
when
i
am
or
when
i
going
to
be
he
laughed
not
at
all
abominably
no
i
do
think
you
can
rather
what
i
resent
in
you
i
wish
i
could
tell
then
perhaps
i
might
avoid
it
you
might
just
give
me
warning
when
you
think
i
going
to
be
it
i
did
give
you
warning
when
when
it
began
there
you
are
i
do
know
when
it
did
begin
what
were
we
talking
about
i
was
talking
about
anything
you
were
talking
about
the
moon
it
was
the
moon
that
did
it
i
suppose
it
was
the
moon
i
see
i
bored
you
how
awful
i
did
say
you
bored
me
you
never
have
bored
me
you
could
bore
me
no
i
just
irritate
you
and
drive
you
mad
you
just
irritate
me
and
drive
me
mad
the
words
were
brutal
but
the
voice
caressed
her
he
took
her
by
the
arm
and
steered
her
amicably
round
a
hidden
boulder
do
you
know
many
women
she
asked
the
question
was
startling
by
reason
of
its
context
the
better
to
consider
it
rowcliffe
withdrew
his
protecting
arm
no
he
said
not
very
many
but
those
you
do
know
you
get
on
with
you
get
on
all
right
with
mary
yes
i
get
on
all
right
with
you
be
horrid
if
you
did
mary
a
dear
well
i
know
where
i
am
with
and
you
get
on
all
right
really
with
papa
as
long
as
i
not
there
as
long
as
you
not
there
yes
so
that
she
pursued
the
horrid
thing
that
happened
to
you
it
looks
like
it
it
feels
like
it
let
say
you
the
horrid
thing
that
happened
to
me
and
leave
it
at
that
they
left
it
rowcliffe
had
a
sort
of
impression
that
he
had
said
all
that
he
had
had
to
say
xxxii
the
vicar
had
called
gwenda
into
his
study
one
day
what
this
i
hear
he
said
of
you
and
young
rowcliffe
scampering
about
all
over
the
country
the
vicar
had
drawn
a
bow
at
a
venture
he
had
not
really
heard
anything
but
he
had
seen
something
two
forms
scrambling
hand
in
hand
up
karva
not
too
distant
to
be
recognisable
as
young
rowcliffe
and
his
daughter
gwenda
yet
too
distant
to
be
pleasing
to
the
vicar
it
was
their
distance
that
made
them
so
improper
i
do
know
papa
said
gwenda
perhaps
you
know
what
was
said
about
your
sister
alice
do
you
want
the
same
thing
to
be
said
about
you
it
wo
be
papa
unless
you
say
it
yourself
she
had
him
there
for
what
was
said
about
alice

been
said
first
of
all
by
him
what
do
you
mean
gwenda
i
mean
that
i
a
little
different
from
alice
are
you
you
when
you
doing
the
same
thing
let
me
see
what
the
dreadful
thing
that
ally
did
she
ran
after
young
rickards
did
she
well
if
you
really
seen
us
scampering
you
know
that
i
generally
running
away
from
young
rowcliffe
and
that
young
rowcliffe
is
generally
running
after
me
he
says
it
as
much
as
he
can
do
to
keep
up
with
me
gwenda
said
the
vicar
solemnly
i
wo
have
it
how
do
you
propose
to
stop
it
papa
you
see
how
it
was
thus
that
his
god
lured
the
vicar
to
destruction
for
he
had
no
plan
he
knew
that
he
could
move
into
another
parish
it
no
good
locking
me
up
in
my
room
said
gwenda
for
i
can
get
out
at
the
window
and
you
ca
very
well
lock
young
rowcliffe
up
in
his
surgery
i
can
forbid
him
the
house
that
no
good
either
so
long
as
he
does
forbid
me
his
you
ca
go
to
him
there
my
girl
i
can
do
anything
when
i
driven
the
vicar
groaned
you

he
said
you
different
from
alice
you
worse
than
she
is
ten
times
worse
stick
at
nothing
i
always
known
it
so
have
i
the
vicar
leaned
against
the
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
to
shut
out
the
shame
of
her
and
then
gwenda
had
pity
on
him
it
all
right
papa
i
not
going
to
rowcliffe
because
no
need
you
not
going
to
lock
him
up
in
his
surgery
and
you
not
going
to
forbid
him
the
house
you
not
going
to
do
anything
going
to
listen
to
me
it
not
a
bit
of
good
trying
to
bully
me
you
be
beaten
every
time
you
can
bully
alice
as
much
as
you
like
you
can
bully
her
till
she
you
can
shut
her
up
in
her
bedroom
and
lock
the
door
and
i
daresay
she
wo
get
out
at
the
window
but
even
alice
will
beat
you
in
the
end
of
course
there
mary
but
i
should
try
it
on
with
mary
either
she
really
more
dangerous
than
i
am
because
she
looks
so
meek
and
mild
but
she
beat
you
too
if
you
begin
bullying
her
the
vicar
raised
his
stricken
head
gwenda
he
said
you
terrible
no
papa
i
not
terrible
i
really
awfully
kind
i
telling
you
these
things
for
your
good
do
you
worry
i
sha
run
very
far
after
young
rowcliffe
xxxiii
left
to
himself
the
vicar
fairly
wallowed
in
his
gloom
he
pressed
his
hands
tightly
to
his
face
crushing
into
darkness
the
image
of
his
daughter
gwenda
that
remained
with
him
after
the
door
had
shut
between
them
it
came
over
him
with
the
very
shutting
of
the
door
not
only
that
there
never
was
a
man
so
cursed
in
his
children
that
thought
had
occurred
to
him
before
but
that
of
the
three
gwenda
was
the
one
in
whom
the
curse
was
so
to
speak
most
active
through
whom
it
was
most
likely
to
fall
on
him
at
any
moment
in
alice
it
could
be
averted
he
knew
he
had
always
known
how
to
deal
with
alice
and
it
would
be
hard
to
say
exactly
where
it
lurked
in
mary
therefore
in
his
times
of
profoundest
the
vicar
overlooked
the
existence
of
his
daughter
mary
he
was
an
artist
in
gloom
and
mary
sweetness
and
goodness
spoiled
the
picture
but
in
gwenda
the
curse
was
imminent
and
at
the
same
time
incalculable
alice
behavior
could
be
fairly
predicted
and
provided
for
there
was
no
knowing
what
gwenda
would
do
next
the
fear
of
what
she
might
do
hung
forever
over
his
head
and
it
made
him
jumpy
and
yet
in
this
sense
of
cursedness
the
vicar
had
found
shelter
for
his
and
now
his
fear
his
noble
and
righteous
fear
of
what
gwenda
might
do
his
conviction
that
she
would
do
something
disguised
more
than
ever
his
humiliating
fear
of
gwenda
she
was
as
he
had
said
terrible
there
was
no
dealing
with
gwenda
there
never
had
been
patience
failed
before
her
will
and
wisdom
before
the
deadly
thrust
of
her
intelligence
she
had
stabbed
him
in
several
places
before
she
had
left
the
room
the
outcome
of
his
brooding
it
would
have
shocked
the
vicar
if
he
could
have
traced
its
genesis
was
an
extraordinary
revulsion
in
rowcliffe
favor
so
far
from
shutting
the
vicarage
door
in
the
young
man
face
the
vicar
was
positively
he
was
inclined
to
open
it
he
could
stand
the
idea
of
other
people
marrying
since
he
really
married
himself
and
could
be
as
long
as
robina
persisted
in
being
alive
thus
cruelly
was
he
held
up
by
that
unscrupulous
and
pitiless
woman
and
the
idea
of
any
of
his
daughters
marrying
was
peculiarly
disagreeable
to
him
he
did
know
why
it
was
disagreeable
and
it
would
have
shocked
him
unspeakably
if
you
had
told
him
why
and
if
you
had
asked
him
he
would
have
had
half
a
dozen
noble
and
righteous
reasons
ready
for
you
at
his
but
the
vicar
with
his
eyes
shut
could
see
clearly
that
if
gwenda
married
rowcliffe
the
unpleasant
event
would
have
its
compensation
he
would
be
rid
of
an
everlasting
source
of
unpleasantness
at
home
he
say
to
himself
that
his
egoism
would
be
rid
of
an
everlasting
fear
he
said
that
if
rowcliffe
married
gwenda
he
would
keep
her
straight
and
then
another
consoling
thought
struck
him
he
could
deal
with
alice
more
effectually
than
ever
neither
mary
nor
alice
knew
what
he
knew
they
had
dreamed
that
it
was
gwenda
that
young
rowcliffe
wanted
he
would
use
his
knowledge
to
bring
alice
to
her
senses
it
was
on
a
wednesday
that
he
dealt
with
her
he
was
coming
in
some
hours
earlier
than
usual
from
his
rounds
when
she
delivered
herself
into
his
hands
by
appearing
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
with
her
hair
extravagantly
dressed
and
wearing
what
he
took
rightly
to
be
a
new
blue
gown
he
opened
the
study
door
and
with
a
treacherous
smile
invited
her
to
enter
then
he
looked
at
her
is
that
another
new
dress
you
got
on
he
inquired
still
with
his
bland
treachery
yes
papa
said
alice
do
you
like
it
the
vicar
drew
himself
up
squared
his
shoulders
and
smiled
again
not
quite
so
blandly
his
attitude
gave
him
a
sensation
of
exquisite
and
powerful
virility
do
i
like
it
i
should
perhaps
if
i
were
a
millionaire
it
did
cost
so
much
as
all
that
said
alice
i
not
asking
you
what
it
cost
but
i
think
you
must
have
anticipated
your
next
allowance
alice
stared
with
wide
eyes
of
innocence
what
if
i
did
it
wo
make
any
difference
in
the
long
run
the
vicar
with
his
hands
plunged
in
his
trousers
pockets
jerked
forward
at
her
from
the
waist
it
was
his
gesture
when
he
thrust
for
all
the
difference
it
make
to
my
dear
child
you
might
have
spared
yourself
the
trouble
and
expense
he
paused
has
young
rowcliffe
been
here
no
said
alice
defiantly
he
has
you
expected
him
i
daresay
mary
did
i
not
asking
what
mary
did
did
you
expect
him
or
did
you
not
he
he
might
turn
up
he
said
he
might
turn
up
you
expected
him
and
he
has
turned
up
and
you
ca
think
why
is
that
so
i
do
know
what
you
mean
papa
i
mean
my
child
that
you
living
in
a
fool
paradise
i
have
a
notion
what
you
mean
by
perhaps
gwenda
can
enlighten
you
the
color
died
in
ally
scared
face
i
ca
see
she
said
what
gwenda
got
to
do
with
it
she
got
something
to
do
with
young
rowcliffe
not
turning
up
i
think
i
met
the
two
of
them
half
way
between
upthorne
and
bar
hill
at
half
past
four
he
took
out
his
watch
and
it
ten
past
six
now
he
sat
down
turning
his
chair
so
as
not
to
see
her
face
he
did
not
at
the
moment
care
to
look
at
her
you
might
go
and
ask
gale
to
send
me
in
a
cup
of
tea
alice
went
out
xxxiv
it
a
quarter
past
six
now
she
said
to
herself
they
must
come
back
from
bar
hill
by
upthorne
i
shall
meet
them
at
upthorne
if
i
start
now
she
slipped
her
rough
coat
over
the
new
gown
and
started
her
fear
drove
her
and
she
went
up
the
hill
at
an
impossible
pace
she
trembled
staggered
stood
still
and
went
on
again
the
twilight
of
the
unborn
moon
was
like
the
horrible
twilight
of
dreams
she
walked
as
she
had
walked
in
nightmares
with
knees
weak
as
water
that
sank
under
her
at
every
step
she
passed
the
schoolhouse
with
its
beckoning
the
schoolhouse
stirred
the
pain
under
her
heart
she
remembered
the
shining
night
when
she
had
shown
herself
there
and
triumphed
the
pain
then
was
so
intolerable
that
her
mind
revolted
from
it
as
from
a
thing
that
simply
could
not
be
the
idea
by
which
she
lived
asserted
itself
against
the
menace
of
destruction
it
was
not
so
much
an
idea
as
an
instinct
blind
obstinate
immovable
it
had
behind
it
the
wisdom
and
the
persistence
of
life
it
refused
to
believe
where
belief
meant
death
to
it
she
said
to
herself
he
lying
he
lying
he
made
it
all
up
he
never
met
them
she
had
passed
the
turn
of
the
hill
she
had
come
to
the
high
towers
sinister
and
indistinct
to
the
hollow
walls
and
haunted
arcades
of
the
dead
mining
station
upthorne
was
hidden
by
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
she
stopped
suddenly
there
where
the
road
skirted
the
arcades
she
was
struck
by
a
shock
of
premonition
an
instinct
older
and
profounder
than
that
wisdom
of
the
blood
she
had
the
sense
that
what
was
happening
now
her
coming
like
this
to
the
towers
and
the
arcades
had
happened
before
and
was
so
related
to
what
was
about
to
happen
that
she
knew
this
also
and
with
the
same
shock
of
recognition
it
would
happen
when
she
had
come
to
the
last
arch
of
the
colonnade
it
was
happening
now
she
had
come
to
the
last
arch
that
instant
she
was
aware
of
rowcliffe
and
gwenda
coming
toward
her
down
the
hill
their
figures
were
almost
indiscernible
in
the
twilight
it
was
by
their
voices
that
she
knew
them
before
they
could
see
her
she
had
slipped
out
of
their
path
behind
the
shelter
of
the
arch
she
knew
them
by
their
voices
yet
their
voices
had
something
in
them
that
she
did
not
know
something
that
told
her
that
they
had
been
with
each
other
many
times
before
that
they
understood
each
other
that
they
were
happy
in
each
other
and
absorbed
the
pain
was
no
longer
inside
her
heart
but
under
it
it
was
dull
rather
than
sharp
yet
it
moved
there
like
a
sharp
sickle
a
sickle
that
gathered
and
ground
the
live
flesh
it
turned
in
and
twisted
a
sensation
of
deadly
sickness
made
her
draw
farther
yet
into
the
corner
of
the
arcade
feeling
her
way
in
the
darkness
with
her
hand
on
the
wall
she
stumbled
on
a
block
of
stone
sank
on
it
and
cowered
there
sobbing
and
shivering
down
in
garth
village
the
church
clock
struck
the
half
hour
and
the
quarter
and
the
hour
at
the
half
hour
blenkiron
the
blacksmith
put
rowcliffe
horse
into
the
trap
the
sound
of
the
clanking
hoofs
came
up
the
hill
rowcliffe
heard
them
first
there
something
wrong
down
there
he
said
they
coming
for
me
in
his
heart
he
cursed
them
for
it
was
there
at
the
turn
of
the
road
below
the
arches
that
he
had
meant
to
say
what
he
had
not
said
the
other
night
there
was
no
moon
the
moment
was
propitious
and
there
just
like
his
cursed
luck
was
blenkiron
with
the
trap
they
met
above
the
schoolhouse
as
the
clock
struck
the
quarter
you
wanted
sir
said
the
blacksmith
at
mrs
gale
is
it
essy
ay
it
assy
in
the
cottage
down
by
the
beck
essy
groaned
and
cried
in
her
agony
and
on
the
road
to
upthorne
under
the
arches
by
the
sinister
towers
alice
cartaret
crouching
on
her
stone
sobbed
and
shivered
not
long
after
seven
essy
child
was
born
just
before
ten
the
three
sisters
sat
waiting
as
they
had
always
waited
bored
and
motionless
for
the
imminent
catastrophe
of
prayers
i
wonder
how
essy
getting
on
said
gwenda
poor
little
essy
mary
said
she
as
pleased
as
punch
said
gwenda
it
a
boy
ally
did
you
know
that
essy
had
a
baby
i
do
care
if
she
has
said
ally
violently
it
got
nothing
to
do
with
me
i
wish
you
would
talk
about
her
beastly
baby
as
the
vicar
came
out
of
his
study
into
the
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
his
youngest
daughter
what
the
matter
with
you
he
said
nothing
the
matter
said
alice
defiantly
why
you
look
he
said
as
if
somebody
was
murdering
you
xxxv
ally
was
ill
so
ill
this
time
that
even
the
vicar
softened
to
her
he
led
her
upstairs
himself
and
made
her
go
to
bed
and
stay
there
he
would
have
sent
for
rowcliffe
but
that
ally
refused
to
see
him
her
mortal
apathy
passed
for
submission
she
took
her
milk
from
her
father
hand
without
a
murmur
there
a
good
girl
he
said
as
she
drank
it
down
but
it
did
do
her
any
good
nothing
did
the
illness
itself
was
no
good
to
her
considering
that
she
did
want
to
be
ill
this
time
she
wanted
to
die
and
of
course
she
could
die
it
would
have
been
too
much
happiness
and
they
would
let
her
have
it
at
first
she
resented
what
she
called
their
interference
she
declared
as
she
had
declared
before
that
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
her
she
was
only
tired
could
they
see
that
she
was
tired
that
tired
her
why
ca
you
leave
me
alone
if
only
you
go
away
she
moaned
all
of
you
and
leave
me
alone
but
very
soon
she
was
too
tired
even
to
be
irritable
she
lay
quiet
sunk
in
the
hollow
of
her
bed
and
kept
her
eyes
shut
so
that
she
never
knew
she
said
whether
they
were
there
or
not
and
it
matter
nothing
mattered
so
long
as
she
could
just
lie
there
it
was
only
when
they
talked
of
sending
for
rowcliffe
that
they
roused
her
then
she
sat
up
and
became
first
vehement
then
violent
you
sha
send
for
him
she
cried
i
wo
see
him
if
he
comes
into
the
house
i
crawl
out
of
it
one
day
it
was
the
last
wednesday
in
april
gwenda
came
to
her
and
told
her
that
rowcliffe
was
there
and
had
asked
to
see
her
ally
pale
eyes
lightened
and
grew
large
they
were
transparent
as
glass
in
her
white
face
did
send
for
him
no
who
did
then
papa
she
closed
her
eyes
the
old
sense
of
ecstasy
came
over
her
of
triumph
too
of
solemn
triumph
as
if
she
whom
they
thought
so
insignificant
had
vindicated
her
tragic
dignity
at
last
for
if
her
father
had
sent
for
rowcliffe
it
could
only
mean
that
she
was
really
dying
nothing
else
nothing
short
of
that
would
have
made
him
send
and
of
course
that
was
what
she
wanted
that
rowcliffe
should
see
her
die
he
would
forget
her
then
he
would
be
compelled
to
think
of
her
you
see
him
wo
you
ally
ally
smiled
her
little
triumphant
and
mysterious
smile
oh
yes
i
see
him
the
vicar
did
not
go
on
his
rounds
that
afternoon
he
stayed
at
home
to
talk
to
rowcliffe
the
two
were
shut
up
together
in
his
study
for
more
than
half
an
hour
as
they
entered
the
at
it
could
be
seen
from
their
manner
and
their
faces
that
something
had
gone
wrong
the
vicar
bore
himself
like
a
man
profoundly
aggrieved
not
to
say
outraged
in
his
own
house
who
nevertheless
was
observing
a
punctilious
courtesy
towards
the
offending
guest
rowcliffe
shoulders
and
his
jaw
were
still
squared
in
the
antagonism
that
had
closed
their
interview
he
too
observed
the
most
perfect
courtesy
only
by
the
consummate
restraint
of
his
manner
did
he
show
how
impossible
he
had
found
the
vicar
while
his
face
betrayed
a
grave
preoccupation
in
which
the
vicar
counted
not
at
all
mary
began
to
talk
to
him
about
the
weather
neither
she
nor
gwenda
dared
ask
him
what
he
thought
of
alice
and
in
ten
minutes
he
was
gone
the
vicar
went
with
him
to
the
gate
still
standing
as
they
had
stood
to
take
leave
of
rowcliffe
the
sisters
looked
at
each
other
mary
spoke
first
whatever
papa
have
said
to
him
this
time
gwenda
knew
what
mary
was
thinking
it
is
that
she
said
it
something
he
said
to
papa
xxxvi
that
night
about
nine
gwenda
came
for
the
third
time
to
rowcliffe
at
his
house
she
was
shown
into
his
study
where
rowcliffe
was
reading
though
the
servant
had
prepared
him
for
her
he
showed
signs
of
agitation
gwenda
eyes
were
ominously
somber
and
she
had
the
white
face
of
a
ghost
a
face
that
to
rowcliffe
as
he
looked
at
it
recalled
the
white
face
of
alice
he
disliked
alice
face
he
always
had
disliked
it
he
disliked
it
more
than
ever
at
that
moment
yet
the
sight
of
this
face
that
was
so
like
it
carried
him
away
in
an
ecstasy
of
tenderness
he
adored
it
because
of
that
likeness
because
of
all
that
the
likeness
revealed
to
him
and
signified
and
it
increased
quite
unendurably
his
agitation
gwenda
was
supernaturally
calm
in
another
instant
the
illusion
that
her
presence
had
given
him
passed
he
saw
what
she
had
come
for
has
anything
gone
wrong
he
asked
she
drew
in
her
breath
sharply
it
alice
yes
i
know
it
alice
anything
wrong
he
said
what
is
it
i
do
know
i
want
you
to
tell
me
that
what
i
come
for
frightened
mean
is
she
worse
she
did
not
answer
him
she
looked
at
him
as
if
she
were
trying
to
read
in
his
eyes
something
that
he
was
trying
not
to
tell
her
yes
he
said
she
worse
i
know
that
she
said
impatiently
i
can
see
it
you
got
to
tell
me
more
but
i
told
you
you
i
have
he
pleaded
i
know
you
tried
to
tell
me
did
i
succeed
you
told
me
why
she
was
ill
i
know
all
that
do
sit
down
he
turned
from
her
and
dragged
the
armchair
forward
there
he
put
a
cushion
at
her
back
that
better
as
she
obeyed
him
she
kept
her
eyes
on
him
the
book
he
had
been
reading
lay
where
he
had
put
it
down
on
the
hearthrug
at
her
feet
its
title
mental
des
janet
stared
at
him
he
picked
it
up
and
flung
it
out
of
sight
as
if
it
had
offended
him
with
all
his
movements
her
head
lifted
and
turned
so
that
her
eyes
followed
him
he
sat
down
and
gazed
at
her
quietly
well
he
said
and
what
did
i
tell
you
you
did
tell
me
how
it
would
end
he
was
silent
is
that
what
you
told
father
has
he
said
anything
he
has
said
a
word
and
you
went
away
without
saying
anything
there
is
much
to
say
that
you
do
know
i
know
why
she
was
you
told
me
but
i
do
know
why
worse
she
better
she
was
quite
well
she
was
running
about
doing
things
and
looking
so
pretty
only
the
other
day
and
look
at
her
now
it
like
that
said
rowcliffe
it
comes
and
goes
he
said
it
quietly
but
the
blood
rose
into
his
face
and
forehead
in
a
painful
flush
but
why
why
she
persisted
it
so
horribly
sudden
it
like
that
too
said
rowcliffe
if
it
like
that
now
what
is
it
going
to
be
how
is
it
going
to
end
that
what
you
tell
me
it
difficult
he
began
i
do
care
how
difficult
it
is
or
how
you
hate
it
you
got
to
all
he
said
to
that
was
you
very
fond
of
her
her
upper
lip
trembled
yes
but
i
do
think
i
knew
it
until
now
that
what
makes
it
difficult
my
not
knowing
it
no
your
being
so
fond
of
her
is
that
just
the
reason
why
i
ought
to
know
yes
i
think
it
is
only
she
held
him
to
it
is
she
going
to
die
i
do
say
she
to
die
but
in
the
state
she
in
she
get
anything
and
die
of
it
if
something
is
done
to
make
her
happy
happy
i
mean
of
course
to
get
her
married
after
all
you
know
you
got
to
face
the
facts
you
think
she
dying
now
and
you
afraid
to
tell
me
no
i
afraid
i
think
she
not
so
likely
to
die
as
to
go
out
of
her
mind
did
you
tell
my
father
that
yes
what
did
he
say
he
said
she
was
out
of
her
mind
already
she
is
of
course
she
is
no
more
than
you
and
i
he
talks
about
putting
the
poor
child
under
restraint
oh
it
preposterous
but
he
make
it
necessary
if
he
continues
his
present
system
what
i
tried
to
impress
on
him
is
that
she
go
out
of
her
mind
if
she
kept
shut
up
in
that
old
vicarage
much
longer
and
that
she
be
all
right
perfectly
all
right
if
she
was
married
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
he
seems
to
be
doing
his
best
to
prevent
it
well
in
her
case
that
simply
criminal
the
worse
of
it
is
i
ca
make
him
see
it
he
annoyed
with
me
he
never
will
see
anything
he
does
like
there
no
reason
why
he
should
dislike
it
so
much
i
mean
her
illness
there
nothing
awful
about
it
there
nothing
awful
about
ally
she
as
good
as
gold
i
know
she
as
good
as
gold
and
she
be
as
strong
as
iron
if
she
was
married
and
had
children
i
seen
no
end
of
women
like
that
and
i
not
sure
they
do
make
the
best
wives
and
mothers
i
told
your
father
that
but
it
no
good
trying
to
tell
him
the
truth
no
it
the
one
thing
he
ca
stand
he
seems
said
rowcliffe
to
have
such
an
extraordinary
distaste
for
the
subject
he
approaches
it
from
an
impossible
point
of
view
as
if
it
was
sin
or
crime
or
something
he
talks
about
her
controlling
herself
as
if
she
could
help
it
why
she
no
more
responsible
for
being
like
that
than
i
am
for
the
shape
of
my
nose
i
afraid
i
told
him
that
if
anybody
was
responsible
was
for
bringing
her
to
the
worst
place
imaginable
he
did
that
on
purpose
i
know
and
i
told
him
he
might
as
well
have
put
her
in
a
lunatic
asylum
at
once
he
meditated
it
not
as
if
he
had
anybody
but
himself
to
think
of
that
no
good
he
never
does
think
of
anybody
but
himself
and
yet
he
be
awfully
sorry
you
know
if
ally
died
they
sat
silent
not
looking
at
each
other
until
gwenda
spoke
again
rowcliffe
he
smiled
as
if
it
amused
him
to
be
addressed
so
formally
do
you
mean
it
or
are
you
frightening
us
will
ally
really
die
or
go
mad
if
she
is
happy
he
was
grave
again
i
really
mean
it
it
a
rather
serious
case
but
it
only
as
i
told
you
there
are
scores
of
women
but
she
waived
them
all
away
i
only
wanted
to
know
her
voice
stopped
suddenly
and
he
thought
that
she
was
going
to
break
down
you
must
take
it
so
hard
he
said
it
not
as
if
it
absolutely
curable
you
must
take
her
away
suddenly
he
remembered
that
he
did
particularly
want
gwenda
to
go
away
he
could
in
fact
bear
the
thought
of
it
better
still
he
said
send
her
away
is
there
anybody
you
could
send
her
to
only
mummy
my
stepmother
she
smiled
through
her
tears
papa
would
never
let
ally
go
to
why
not
because
she
ran
away
from
him
he
tried
not
to
laugh
she
really
quite
decent
though
you
might
think
it
rowcliffe
smiled
and
she
fond
of
ally
she
fond
of
all
of
us
except
papa
and
she
added
she
knows
a
lot
of
people
he
smiled
again
he
pictured
the
third
cartaret
as
a
woman
of
affectionate
gaiety
and
a
pleasing
worldliness
so
well
surrounded
by
adorers
of
his
own
sex
that
she
could
probably
furnish
forth
her
three
stepdaughters
from
the
numbers
of
those
she
had
no
use
for
he
was
more
than
ever
disgusted
with
the
vicar
who
had
driven
from
him
a
woman
so
admirably
fitted
to
play
a
mother
part
she
sounds
he
said
as
if
she
be
the
very
one
she
would
be
it
an
awful
pity
well
he
said
we
wo
talk
any
more
about
it
now
we
think
of
something
we
simply
get
her
away
he
was
thinking
that
he
knew
of
somebody
a
doctor
widow
who
also
would
be
fitted
if
they
could
afford
to
pay
her
and
if
they
could
he
would
very
soon
have
the
right
that
was
what
his
we
meant
presently
he
excused
himself
and
went
out
to
see
he
said
about
getting
her
some
tea
he
judged
that
if
she
were
left
alone
for
a
moment
she
would
pull
herself
together
and
be
as
ready
as
ever
for
their
walk
back
to
garthdale
it
was
in
that
moment
when
he
left
her
that
she
made
her
choice
not
that
when
her
idea
had
come
to
her
she
had
known
a
hesitation
she
did
know
when
it
had
come
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
had
been
with
her
all
through
their
awful
interview
it
was
she
and
not
ally
who
would
have
to
go
away
she
could
see
it
now
it
had
been
approaching
her
her
idea
from
the
very
instant
that
she
had
come
into
the
room
and
had
begun
to
speak
to
him
and
with
every
word
that
had
said
it
had
come
closer
but
not
until
her
final
appeal
to
him
had
she
really
faced
it
then
it
became
clear
it
crystallised
there
was
no
escaping
from
the
facts
ally
would
die
or
go
mad
if
she
did
marry
ally
though
rowcliffe
did
know
it
was
in
love
with
him
and
even
if
she
had
been
as
long
as
they
stayed
in
garthdale
there
was
nobody
but
rowcliffe
whom
she
could
marry
it
was
her
one
chance
and
there
were
three
of
them
there
three
women
to
one
man
and
since
was
the
one
she
knew
it
who
stood
between
him
and
ally
it
was
she
who
would
have
to
go
away
it
seemed
to
her
that
long
ago
all
the
time
in
fact
ever
since
she
had
known
rowcliffe
she
had
known
that
this
was
what
she
would
have
to
face
she
faced
it
now
with
a
strange
courage
and
a
sort
of
spiritual
exaltation
as
she
would
have
faced
any
terrible
truth
that
rowcliffe
had
told
her
if
for
instance
he
had
told
her
that
she
was
going
to
die
that
of
course
was
what
it
felt
like
she
had
known
that
it
would
feel
like
that
and
as
sometimes
happens
to
people
who
are
going
to
die
and
know
it
there
came
to
her
a
peculiar
vivid
and
poignant
sense
of
her
surroundings
of
rowcliffe
room
and
the
things
in
it
the
chair
he
had
sat
in
the
pipe
he
had
laid
aside
the
book
he
had
been
reading
and
that
he
had
flung
away
outside
the
open
window
the
trees
of
the
little
orchard
whitened
by
the
moonlight
stood
as
if
fixed
in
a
tender
pure
and
supernatural
beauty
she
could
see
the
flags
on
the
path
and
the
stones
in
the
gray
walls
they
stood
out
with
a
strange
significance
and
importance
as
if
near
and
yet
horribly
far
away
she
could
hear
rowcliffe
footsteps
in
the
passage
it
came
over
her
that
she
was
sitting
in
rowcliffe
room
like
this
for
the
last
time
then
her
heart
dragged
and
tore
at
her
as
if
it
fought
against
her
will
to
die
but
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
this
dying
of
hers
was
willed
by
her
it
seemed
foredoomed
inevitable
and
now
she
was
looking
up
in
rowcliffe
face
and
smiling
at
him
as
he
brought
her
her
tea
that
right
he
said
he
was
entirely
reassured
by
her
appearance
look
here
shall
i
drive
you
back
or
do
you
feel
like
another
walk
she
hesitated
it
late
he
said
but
no
matter
let
be
reckless
there
no
need
i
got
my
bicycle
then
i
get
mine
she
rose
do
i
going
back
alone
you
not
i
coming
with
you
i
want
to
come
if
you
do
mind
i
rather
you
did
i
drive
you
then
i
ca
let
you
go
alone
but
i
she
said
to
be
alone
he
stood
looking
at
her
with
a
sort
of
sullen
tenderness
you
not
going
to
worry
about
what
i
told
you
you
did
tell
me
i
knew
then
but
she
persisted
no
i
shall
be
all
right
she
said
there
a
moon
in
the
end
he
let
her
have
her
way
moon
or
no
moon
he
saw
that
it
was
not
his
moment
xxxvii
what
gwenda
had
to
do
she
did
quickly
she
wrote
to
the
third
cartaret
that
night
she
told
her
nothing
except
that
she
wanted
to
get
something
to
do
in
london
and
to
get
it
as
soon
as
possible
and
she
asked
her
stepmother
if
she
could
put
her
up
for
a
week
or
two
until
she
got
it
and
would
mummy
mind
wiring
yes
or
no
on
saturday
morning
it
was
then
thursday
night
she
slipped
out
into
the
village
about
midnight
to
post
the
letter
though
she
knew
that
it
could
go
one
minute
before
three
on
friday
afternoon
she
had
no
conscious
fear
that
her
will
would
fail
her
but
her
instinct
was
appeased
by
action
on
saturday
morning
cartaret
wired
delighted
expect
you
friday
mummy
five
intolerable
days
they
were
not
more
intolerable
than
the
days
that
would
come
after
when
the
thing
she
was
doing
would
be
every
bit
as
hard
only
her
instinct
was
afraid
of
something
happening
within
those
five
days
that
would
make
the
hard
thing
harder
on
sunday
cartaret
letter
came
her
house
she
said
was
crammed
with
fiends
till
friday
there
was
a
beast
of
a
woman
in
gwenda
room
who
simply
would
go
but
on
friday
gwenda
room
would
be
ready
it
had
been
waiting
for
her
all
the
time
had
they
settled
it
that
gwenda
was
to
come
and
live
with
her
if
things
became
impossible
at
home
robina
supposed
they
impossible
she
sent
her
love
to
alice
and
mary
and
she
was
always
gwenda
loving
mummy
and
she
enclosed
a
note
for
she
was
a
generous
soul
on
monday
gwenda
told
peacock
the
carrier
to
bring
her
a
bradshaw
from
reyburn
she
then
considered
how
she
was
to
account
to
her
family
for
her
departure
she
decided
that
she
would
tell
mary
first
and
she
might
as
well
tell
her
the
truth
while
she
was
about
it
since
if
she
did
mary
would
be
sure
to
find
it
out
she
was
sweet
and
good
not
so
sweet
and
good
that
she
could
hold
her
own
against
papa
if
she
was
driven
to
it
but
sweet
enough
and
good
enough
to
stand
by
ally
and
to
see
her
through
it
would
be
easy
for
mary
it
was
as
if
she
had
ever
even
begun
to
care
for
rowcliffe
it
was
as
if
rowcliffe
had
ever
cared
for
her
and
she
could
be
trusted
a
secret
was
always
safe
with
mary
she
was
positively
uncanny
in
her
silence
and
quite
superhumanly
discreet
mary
then
should
be
told
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
her
father
should
be
told
as
much
of
it
as
he
was
likely
to
believe
ally
of
course
must
have
an
inkling
mary
herself
had
an
inkling
already
when
she
appeared
that
evening
in
the
attic
where
gwenda
was
packing
a
trunk
she
had
a
new
bradshaw
in
her
hand
peacock
gave
me
this
said
mary
he
said
you
ordered
it
so
i
did
said
gwenda
what
on
earth
for
to
look
up
trains
in
why
is
anybody
coming
does
anybody
come
mary
face
admitted
her
absurdity
then
she
made
it
out
almost
with
difficulty
somebody
must
be
going
away
how
clever
you
are
somebody
going
away
mary
twisted
her
brows
in
her
perplexity
she
was
evidently
thinking
things
do
you
mean
steven
rowcliffe
no
dear
lamb
what
on
earth
had
put
steven
rowcliffe
into
head
it
not
as
bad
as
all
that
it
only
a
woman
in
fact
only
me
mary
face
emptied
itself
of
all
expression
it
became
a
blank
screen
suddenly
put
up
before
the
disarray
of
hurrying
eager
things
unclothed
and
unexpressed
i
going
to
stay
with
mummy
gwenda
closed
the
lid
of
the
trunk
and
sat
on
it
perturbation
was
now
in
mary
face
you
ca
gwenda
papa
never
let
you
go
he
ca
stop
me
what
on
earth
are
you
going
for
not
for
my
own
amusement
though
it
sounds
amusing
does
mummy
want
you
whether
she
wants
me
or
not
she
got
to
have
me
for
how
long
mary
face
was
heavy
with
thought
now
i
do
know
i
going
to
get
something
to
do
to
mary
said
to
herself
then
certainly
it
was
not
amusing
she
pondered
it
is
it
she
brought
out
because
of
steven
rowcliffe
no
it
because
of
ally
ally
yes
did
papa
tell
you
about
her
not
he
did
he
tell
you
no
it
was
steven
rowcliffe
and
she
told
mary
what
rowcliffe
had
said
to
her
she
had
made
room
for
her
on
her
trunk
and
they
sat
there
their
bodies
touching
their
heads
drawn
back
each
sister
staring
with
eyes
that
gave
and
took
the
other
horror
do
molly
do
mary
was
crying
now
does
papa
know
that
she
die
or
go
mad
yes
but
mary
lifted
her
stained
face
that
what
they
said
about
mother
if
she
had
children
it
if
ally
has
any
and
papa
knew
it
and
he
knows
it
now
how
awful
it
is
as
awful
as
steven
rowcliffe
thinks
he
does
really
know
what
wrong
with
her
he
does
know
she
in
love
with
poor
ally
what
the
good
he
is
in
love
with
her
he
is
now
said
gwenda
but
he
will
be
not
he
it
you
he
cares
for
if
he
cares
for
anybody
i
know
that
why
i
going
oh
gwenda
mary
face
was
somber
as
she
took
it
in
that
wo
do
ally
any
good
if
you
he
cares
i
do
absolutely
know
it
and
if
i
did
it
would
make
any
difference
and
if
you
care
for
him
that
does
make
any
difference
either
i
got
to
clear
out
her
one
chance
molly
i
got
to
give
it
her
how
i
let
her
die
poor
darling
or
go
mad
she
be
all
right
if
he
marries
her
and
if
he
does
he
may
molly
he
may
if
i
clear
out
in
time
anyhow
there
anybody
else
if
only
mary
said
papa
had
kept
a
curate
but
he
has
kept
a
curate
he
never
will
keep
a
curate
and
if
he
does
he
choose
a
man
with
a
wife
and
seven
children
no
choose
no
children
the
wife
must
have
a
chance
of
dying
gwenda
do
you
think
anybody
they
did
you
know
before
and
it
was
awful
nobody
knows
this
time
except
papa
and
steven
rowcliffe
and
you
and
me
i
wish
i
did
i
wish
you
had
told
me
you
to
know
or
i
would
have
told
you
do
you
think
steven
rowcliffe
would
have
told
how
could
he
it
was
awful
of
him
he
could
because
he
is
a
coward
or
a
fool
and
he
knew
that
i
not
a
coward
or
a
fool
either
he
thought
ally
had
nobody
but
me
have
nobody
but
you
when
i
gone
you
must
let
her
see
you
think
her
awful
you
must
it
she
is
she
as
good
as
gold
steven
rowcliffe
said
so
if
she
was
molly
i
would
ask
you
to
help
her
with
him
gwenda
you
must
put
it
all
on
me
i
do
anything
for
poor
ally
but
i
make
him
marry
her
if
he
does
want
to
i
think
ally
can
make
him
want
to
if
she
gets
a
chance
you
only
got
to
stick
to
her
and
see
her
through
you
have
to
ask
him
here
you
know
ca
and
you
have
to
keep
papa
off
her
if
not
very
careful
he
go
and
put
her
under
restraint
or
something
oh
would
it
come
to
that
yes
papa
do
it
like
a
shot
i
believe
he
do
it
just
to
stop
her
marrying
him
you
must
tell
papa
what
i
told
you
you
tell
ally
and
you
must
tell
him
do
you
hear
molly
you
must
never
tell
him
of
course
i
wo
tell
him
but
it
no
use
thinking
we
can
do
things
gwenda
stood
up
we
have
got
to
things
that
his
business
we
only
got
to
sit
tight
and
play
the
game
gwenda
went
on
with
her
packing
it
will
be
time
enough
she
thought
to
tell
ally
tomorrow
ally
was
in
her
room
she
never
came
downstairs
now
and
this
week
she
was
worse
and
had
stayed
all
day
in
bed
they
could
rouse
her
but
something
had
roused
her
this
evening
a
sort
of
scratching
on
the
door
made
gwenda
look
up
from
her
packing
ally
stood
on
the
threshold
she
had
dressed
herself
completely
in
her
tweed
skirt
white
blouse
and
knitted
tie
her
strength
had
failed
her
only
in
the
struggle
with
her
hair
the
coil
had
fallen
and
hung
in
a
loose
pigtail
down
her
back
slowly
in
the
weakness
of
her
apathy
she
trailed
across
the
floor
ally
what
is
it
why
did
you
send
for
me
it
all
right
i
wanted
to
get
up
i
coming
down
to
supper
you
can
leave
off
packing
that
old
trunk
you
have
got
to
go
who
told
you
i
was
going
nobody
i
knew
it
she
answered
gwenda
eyes
i
do
know
how
i
knew
it
but
i
did
and
i
know
why
you
going
and
it
all
rot
you
going
because
you
know
that
if
you
stay
steven
marry
you
and
you
think
that
if
you
go
he
marry
me
whatever
put
that
idea
into
your
head
nothing
put
it
it
came
it
shows
how
awful
you
must
think
me
if
you
think
i
go
and
do
a
beastly
thing
like
that
like
what
why
sneaking
him
away
from
you
behind
your
back
when
i
know
you
like
him
you
need
lie
about
it
you
like
him
i
may
be
awful
she
went
on
in
fact
i
know
i
awful
but
decent
i
could
do
a
caddish
thing
like
that
i
could
really
and
if
i
could
there
no
need
for
you
to
go
she
was
sitting
on
the
trunk
where
mary
had
sat
and
when
she
began
to
speak
she
had
looked
down
at
her
small
hands
that
grasped
the
edge
of
the
lid
their
fingers
picking
nervously
at
the
ragged
flap
they
ceased
and
she
looked
up
and
in
her
look
a
look
that
for
the
moment
was
divinely
lucid
gwenda
saw
ally
secret
and
hidden
kinship
with
herself
she
saw
it
as
if
through
some
medium
once
troubled
and
now
made
suddenly
transparent
it
was
because
of
that
queer
kinship
that
ally
had
divined
her
however
awful
she
was
however
tragically
foredoomed
and
driven
ally
was
decent
she
knew
what
gwenda
was
doing
because
it
was
what
if
any
sustained
lucidity
were
ever
given
her
she
might
have
done
herself
but
in
ally
no
idea
but
the
one
idea
was
very
deeply
rooted
sustained
lucidity
never
had
been
hers
it
would
be
easy
to
delude
her
i
going
gwenda
said
because
i
want
to
if
i
stayed
i
marry
steven
rowcliffe
and
steven
rowcliffe
would
marry
me
but
i
thought
i
thought
what
did
you
think
that
there
was
something
between
you
papa
said
so
if
papa
said
so
you
might
have
known
there
was
nothing
in
it
and
is
there
of
course
there
is
you
can
put
that
idea
out
of
your
head
forever
all
the
same
i
believe
that
why
you
going
i
going
because
i
ca
stand
this
place
any
longer
you
said
be
sick
of
it
in
three
months
you
not
sick
of
it
you
love
it
it
me
you
ca
stand
no
ally
no
she
plunged
for
another
argument
and
found
it
what
i
ca
stand
is
living
with
papa
ally
agreed
that
this
was
rather
more
than
plausible
xxxviii
the
next
person
to
be
told
was
rowcliffe
it
was
known
in
the
village
through
the
telegrams
that
gwenda
was
going
away
the
postmistress
told
gale
who
told
blenkiron
these
two
persons
and
four
or
five
others
had
known
ever
since
sunday
that
the
vicar
daughter
was
going
away
and
the
vicar
did
not
know
it
yet
and
blenkiron
told
rowcliffe
on
the
wednesday
before
alice
told
him
for
it
was
alice
who
told
him
and
not
gwenda
gwenda
was
not
at
home
when
he
called
at
the
vicarage
at
three
but
he
heard
from
alice
that
she
would
be
back
at
four
and
it
was
alice
who
told
gale
that
when
the
doctor
called
again
he
was
to
be
shown
into
the
study
he
had
waited
there
thirteen
minutes
before
gwenda
came
to
him
he
looked
at
her
and
was
struck
by
a
difference
he
found
in
her
a
difference
that
recalled
some
look
in
her
face
that
he
had
seen
before
it
was
dead
white
and
in
its
whiteness
her
blue
eyes
dark
and
dilated
quivered
with
defiance
and
a
sort
of
fear
she
looked
older
and
at
the
same
time
younger
as
young
as
alice
and
as
helpless
in
her
fear
then
he
remembered
that
she
had
looked
like
that
the
night
she
had
passed
him
in
the
doorway
of
the
house
at
upthorne
how
cold
your
hands
are
he
said
she
hid
them
behind
her
back
as
if
they
had
betrayed
her
do
you
want
to
see
me
about
ally
no
i
do
want
to
see
you
about
ally
i
want
to
see
you
about
yourself
her
eyes
quivered
again
wo
you
come
into
the
then
i
rather
stay
here
if
you
do
mind
i
say
how
much
time
have
i
till
when
well
till
your
father
comes
back
he
wo
be
back
for
another
hour
but
i
hear
you
going
away
on
friday
and
that
you
going
for
good
did
mary
tell
you
no
it
was
alice
she
said
i
was
to
try
and
stop
you
you
ca
stop
me
if
i
want
to
go
i
do
my
best
they
stood
as
they
talked
in
rigid
attitudes
that
suggested
that
neither
was
going
to
yield
an
inch
why
did
you
tell
me
yourself
gwenda
she
closed
her
eyes
it
was
as
if
she
had
forgotten
why
was
it
because
you
knew
i
would
let
you
did
you
want
to
go
as
much
as
all
that
it
looks
like
it
does
it
yes
but
you
do
want
to
go
a
bit
would
i
go
if
i
did
yes
it
just
the
sort
of
thing
you
would
do
if
you
thought
it
would
annoy
me
it
only
what
you
been
doing
for
the
last
three
months
getting
away
from
me
three
months
oh
i
cared
for
you
before
that
it
only
the
last
three
months
been
trying
to
tell
you
you
never
told
me
anything
because
you
never
gave
me
a
chance
you
kept
on
putting
me
off
and
if
i
did
did
that
show
that
i
did
want
you
to
tell
me
i
do
want
you
to
tell
me
now
he
made
an
impatient
movement
but
you
knew
without
telling
you
knew
then
i
did
i
did
well
then
you
know
now
will
you
marry
me
or
will
you
not
i
want
it
straight
no
no
and
why
not
he
was
horribly
cool
and
calm
because
i
do
want
to
marry
you
i
do
want
to
marry
anybody
good
god
what
you
want
then
i
want
to
go
away
and
earn
my
own
living
as
other
women
do
the
absurdity
of
it
melted
him
he
could
have
gone
down
on
his
knees
at
her
feet
and
kissed
her
cold
hands
he
wondered
afterward
why
on
earth
he
had
then
he
remembered
that
all
the
time
she
had
kept
her
hands
locked
behind
her
you
poor
child
you
do
want
to
earn
your
own
living
i
tell
you
what
you
want
you
want
to
get
away
from
home
and
what
if
i
do
you
seen
what
it
like
would
stay
in
it
a
day
longer
than
you
could
help
if
you
were
me
of
course
i
would
of
course
i
seen
what
it
like
i
saw
it
the
first
time
i
saw
you
here
in
this
detestable
house
i
want
to
take
you
away
out
of
it
i
think
i
wanted
to
take
you
away
then
oh
no
not
then
not
so
long
ago
as
that
it
was
as
if
she
had
said
not
that
that
makes
it
too
hard
any
cruelty
you
like
but
that
or
i
ca
go
through
with
it
yes
he
said
as
long
ago
as
that
you
ca
take
me
away
ca
i
i
can
take
you
anywhere
and
i
will
anywhere
you
like
you
only
got
to
say
i
i
can
make
you
happy
how
do
you
know
because
i
know
you
that
what
you
always
saying
and
you
know
nothing
about
me
nothing
nothing
she
said
to
herself
he
does
he
does
even
know
why
i
going
i
know
a
lot
more
than
you
think
and
a
lot
more
than
you
know
yourself
i
know
that
you
not
happy
as
you
are
and
i
know
that
you
ca
without
happiness
if
you
not
happy
you
be
ill
more
horribly
ill
perhaps
than
alice
look
at
alice
i
not
like
alice
not
now
not
next
year
not
for
ten
years
perhaps
or
twenty
but
you
do
know
what
you
may
be
she
raised
her
head
i
shall
never
be
like
that
never
rowcliffe
laughed
it
struck
her
then
that
that
was
what
she
ought
never
to
have
said
if
she
wanted
to
carry
out
her
purpose
when
i
say
i
not
like
ally
i
mean
that
i
not
so
dependent
on
people
i
not
gentle
like
ally
i
not
as
loving
and
i
not
as
womanly
in
fact
i
not
womanly
at
all
my
dear
child
do
you
suppose
it
matters
to
me
what
you
not
as
long
as
i
love
you
as
you
are
no
she
said
you
do
love
me
really
you
only
think
you
do
she
clung
to
that
why
do
you
say
that
gwenda
because
if
you
did
i
should
have
known
it
before
now
well
considering
that
you
know
it
now
i
mean
you
have
said
so
before
i
say
i
like
that
i
have
said
so
about
five
times
if
you
ever
given
me
a
chance
oh
no
you
had
your
chance
when
did
i
have
it
when
the
other
day
up
at
bar
hill
you
thought
so
then
i
did
say
i
thought
so
then
i
think
so
now
that
rather
clever
of
you
because
you
see
if
you
thought
so
then
that
shows
what
does
it
show
why
that
you
knew
all
the
time
and
that
you
were
thinking
of
me
you
know
you
think
no
no
it
only
that
i
got
to
that
you
me
think
of
you
now
but
i
not
thinking
of
you
the
way
you
want
if
you
not
if
you
have
thought
of
me
way
i
then
i
ca
make
you
out
you
beyond
me
they
sat
down
tired
out
with
the
struggle
as
if
they
had
reached
the
same
point
of
exhaustion
at
the
same
instant
why
not
leave
it
at
that
she
said
he
rallied
because
i
ca
leave
it
at
that
you
knew
i
cared
you
must
have
seen
i
could
have
sworn
you
saw
i
could
have
sworn
she
knew
what
he
was
going
to
swear
and
she
stopped
him
i
see
that
you
thought
you
cared
for
me
if
you
been
quite
sure
you
have
told
me
you
would
have
waited
you
not
quite
sure
now
you
only
telling
me
now
because
i
going
away
if
i
had
said
i
was
going
away
you
never
have
told
me
you
just
have
gone
on
waiting
till
you
were
quite
sure
she
had
irritated
him
now
beyond
endurance
gwenda
he
said
savagely
you
enough
to
drive
a
man
mad
you
told
me
before
anyhow
do
you
see
that
i
should
go
on
driving
you
mad
do
you
see
how
unhappy
you
be
with
me
how
impossible
it
all
is
she
laughed
it
was
marvelous
to
her
how
she
achieved
that
laugh
it
was
as
if
she
had
just
thought
of
it
and
it
came
i
can
see
he
said
that
do
care
for
me
he
had
given
himself
into
her
hands
hands
that
seemed
to
him
diabolic
in
their
play
did
i
ever
i
cared
well
of
all
the
women
you
no
you
did
it
did
i
ever
show
it
good
god
how
do
know
what
you
showed
if
it
had
been
any
other
woman
yes
i
could
have
sworn
you
ca
swear
to
any
woman
i
afraid
till
you
married
her
perhaps
not
then
you
should
say
things
like
that
they
sound
how
do
they
sound
as
if
you
knew
too
much
she
smiled
well
then
there
another
reason
he
softened
suddenly
i
did
mean
that
gwenda
you
do
know
what
you
saying
you
do
know
anything
it
only
that
you
so
beastly
clever
that
a
better
reason
still
you
do
want
to
marry
a
beastly
clever
woman
you
really
do
i
risk
it
that
sort
of
cleverness
does
last
long
it
would
last
your
time
she
said
she
rose
it
was
as
much
as
giving
him
his
dismissal
he
stood
a
moment
watching
her
she
and
all
her
movements
still
seemed
to
him
incredible
do
you
mind
telling
me
where
you
going
to
i
going
to
mummy
she
explained
to
his
blankness
my
stepmother
he
remembered
mummy
was
the
lady
who
was
the
very
one
the
lady
of
remarkable
resources
it
seemed
to
him
then
that
he
saw
it
all
he
knew
what
she
was
going
for
i
see
instead
of
your
sister
he
sneered
papa
would
let
ally
go
to
her
but
he
ca
stop
oh
no
nobody
could
stop
she
smiled
softly
she
had
missed
the
brutality
of
his
emphasis
he
said
to
himself
that
gwenda
was
impossible
she
was
obstinate
and
conceited
and
she
was
utterly
selfish
a
cold
mass
of
egoism
cold
he
was
not
so
sure
she
might
be
but
she
was
capable
he
suspected
of
adventures
instead
of
taking
her
sister
away
to
have
her
chance
she
was
rushing
off
to
secure
it
herself
and
the
irony
of
the
thing
was
that
it
was
he
who
had
put
it
into
her
head
well
she
was
no
worse
and
no
better
than
the
rest
of
them
only
unlike
them
in
the
queerness
of
her
fascination
he
wondered
how
long
it
would
have
lasted
you
could
go
on
caring
for
a
woman
like
that
who
had
never
cared
a
rap
about
you
and
yet
he
could
have
sworn
oh
was
nothing
she
had
only
thought
of
him
because
he
had
been
her
only
chance
he
made
himself
think
these
things
of
her
because
they
gave
him
unspeakable
consolation
all
the
way
back
to
morfe
he
thought
them
while
on
his
right
hand
karva
rose
and
receded
and
rose
again
and
changed
at
every
turn
its
aspect
and
its
form
he
thought
them
to
an
accompaniment
of
an
interior
persistent
voice
the
voice
of
his
romantic
youth
that
said
to
him
that
is
her
hill
her
hill
do
you
remember
that
where
you
met
her
first
that
where
you
saw
her
jumping
that
her
hill
her
hill
her
hill
xxxix
the
vicar
had
been
fidgeting
in
his
study
getting
up
and
sitting
down
and
looking
at
the
clock
every
two
minutes
gwenda
had
told
him
that
she
wanted
to
speak
to
him
and
he
had
stipulated
that
the
interview
should
be
after
prayer
time
for
he
knew
that
he
was
going
to
be
upset
he
never
allowed
family
disturbances
if
he
could
help
it
to
interfere
with
the
attitude
he
kept
up
before
his
maker
he
knew
perfectly
well
she
was
going
to
tell
him
of
her
engagement
to
young
rowcliffe
and
though
he
had
been
prepared
for
the
news
any
time
for
the
last
three
months
he
had
to
pull
himself
together
to
receive
it
he
would
have
to
pretend
that
he
was
pleased
about
it
when
he
was
pleased
at
all
he
was
in
fact
intensely
sorry
for
himself
it
had
dawned
on
him
that
with
alice
left
a
permanent
invalid
on
his
hands
he
could
really
afford
to
part
with
gwenda
she
might
be
terrible
in
the
house
but
in
her
way
a
way
he
did
altogether
approve
of
she
was
useful
in
the
parish
she
would
cover
more
of
it
in
an
afternoon
than
mary
could
in
a
month
of
sundays
but
though
the
idea
of
gwenda
marrying
was
disagreeable
to
him
for
so
many
reasons
he
was
not
going
to
forbid
it
absolutely
he
was
only
going
to
insist
that
she
should
wait
it
was
only
reasonable
and
decent
that
she
should
wait
until
alice
got
either
better
or
bad
enough
to
be
put
under
restraint
the
vicar
pity
for
himself
reached
its
climax
when
he
considered
that
awful
alternative
he
had
been
considering
it
ever
since
rowcliffe
had
spoken
to
him
about
alice
it
was
just
like
gwenda
to
go
and
get
engaged
at
such
a
moment
when
he
was
beside
himself
but
he
smoothed
his
face
into
a
smile
when
she
appeared
well
what
is
it
what
is
this
great
thing
you
come
to
tell
me
it
struck
him
that
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
gwenda
looked
embarrassed
as
well
she
might
be
oh
it
is
very
great
papa
it
only
that
i
going
away
going
i
do
mean
out
of
the
country
only
to
london
ha
going
to
london
he
rolled
it
ruminatingly
on
his
tongue
well
if
that
all
you
come
to
say
it
very
simple
you
go
he
bent
his
knees
with
the
little
gesture
that
he
had
when
he
put
his
foot
down
but
said
gwenda
i
going
he
raised
his
eyebrows
and
why
is
this
the
first
time
i
heard
of
it
because
i
want
to
go
without
any
bother
since
i
going
to
go
oh
consideration
for
me
i
suppose
for
both
of
us
i
do
want
you
to
worry
that
why
you
chosen
a
time
when
i
worried
out
of
my
wits
already
i
know
papa
that
why
i
going
he
was
arrested
both
by
the
astounding
statement
and
by
something
unusually
placable
in
her
tone
he
stared
at
her
as
his
way
was
then
suddenly
he
had
a
light
on
it
gwenda
there
must
be
something
behind
all
this
you
better
tell
me
straight
out
what
happened
nothing
has
happened
you
know
what
i
mean
we
spoken
about
this
before
is
there
anything
between
you
and
young
rowcliffe
nothing
nothing
whatever
of
the
sort
you
mean
you
sure
there
has
been
he
paused
discreetly
for
his
word
some
misunderstanding
quite
sure
there
is
anything
to
misunderstand
i
going
because
i
want
to
go
there
are
too
many
of
us
at
home
too
many
of
you
in
the
state
your
sister
in
that
exactly
why
i
going
i
trying
to
tell
you
ally
go
on
being
ill
as
long
as
there
are
three
of
us
knocking
about
the
house
you
find
she
buck
up
like
anything
when
i
gone
nothing
the
matter
with
her
really
that
may
be
your
opinion
it
is
rowcliffe
i
know
it
is
but
it
soon
will
be
it
was
your
own
idea
a
little
while
ago
ye
es
before
this
last
attack
perhaps
know
what
rowcliffe
thinks
of
her
yes
but
i
know
a
lot
more
about
ally
than
he
does
so
do
you
well
they
were
sitting
down
to
it
now
but
i
ca
afford
to
keep
you
if
you
go
away
of
course
you
ca
you
wo
have
to
keep
me
i
going
to
keep
myself
again
he
stared
this
was
preposterous
it
all
right
papa
it
all
settled
by
whom
by
me
you
found
something
to
do
in
london
not
yet
i
going
to
look
and
what
inquired
the
vicar
with
an
even
suaver
irony
you
do
i
can
be
somebody
secretary
whose
oh
said
gwenda
airily
anybody
and
if
i
may
ask
what
will
you
do
and
where
do
you
propose
to
stay
while
you
looking
for
him
he
felt
that
he
expressed
himself
with
perspicacity
that
all
arranged
i
going
to
mummy
the
vicar
was
silent
with
the
shock
of
it
i
sorry
papa
said
gwenda
but
there
nowhere
else
to
go
to
if
you
go
there
said
cartaret
you
will
certainly
not
come
back
here
all
that
had
passed
till
now
had
been
mere
skirmishing
the
real
battle
had
begun
gwenda
set
her
face
to
it
i
shall
not
be
coming
back
in
any
case
she
said
that
question
can
stand
over
till
you
gone
i
shall
be
gone
on
friday
by
the
three
train
i
shall
not
allow
you
to
go
by
any
train
how
are
you
going
to
stop
me
he
had
not
considered
it
you
do
suppose
i
going
to
give
you
any
money
to
go
with
you
need
i
got
heaps
and
how
are
you
going
to
get
your
luggage
to
the
station
oh
the
usual
way
there
be
no
way
if
i
forbid
peacock
to
carry
it
or
you
can
you
forbid
jim
greatorex
take
me
like
a
shot
i
can
put
your
luggage
under
lock
and
key
he
was
still
stern
though
he
was
aware
that
the
discussion
was
descending
to
sheer
foolishness
i
go
without
it
i
can
carry
a
toothbrush
and
a
comb
and
mummy
will
have
heaps
of
nightgowns
the
vicar
leaned
forward
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
before
that
poignant
evocation
of
robina
gwenda
saw
that
she
had
gone
too
far
she
had
a
queer
longing
to
go
down
on
her
knees
before
him
and
drag
his
hands
from
his
poor
face
and
ask
him
to
forgive
her
she
struggled
with
and
overcame
the
morbid
impulse
the
vicar
lifted
his
face
and
for
a
moment
they
looked
at
each
other
while
he
measured
visibly
his
forces
against
hers
she
shook
her
head
at
him
almost
tenderly
he
was
purely
pathetic
to
her
now
it
no
use
papa
you
far
better
give
it
up
you
know
you
do
it
you
ca
stop
me
you
ca
stop
jim
greatorex
you
ca
even
stop
peacock
you
do
want
scandal
in
the
parish
he
did
oh
go
your
own
way
he
said
and
take
the
consequences
i
taken
them
said
gwenda
she
thought
i
wonder
what
he
have
said
if
i
told
him
the
truth
but
if
i
had
he
never
have
believed
it
the
truth
indeed
was
far
beyond
the
vicar
power
of
belief
he
only
supposed
after
some
reflection
that
gwenda
was
going
off
in
a
huff
because
young
rowcliffe
had
failed
to
come
to
the
scratch
he
knew
what
this
running
up
to
london
and
earning
her
own
living
meant
she
he
would
have
trusted
ally
sooner
gwenda
was
capable
of
anything
and
as
he
thought
of
what
she
might
be
capable
of
in
london
he
sighed
god
help
her
xl
it
was
may
five
weeks
since
gwenda
had
left
garthdale
five
wednesdays
came
and
went
and
rowcliffe
had
not
been
seen
or
heard
of
at
the
vicarage
it
struck
even
the
vicar
that
considerably
more
had
passed
between
his
daughter
and
the
doctor
than
gwenda
had
been
willing
to
admit
whatever
had
passed
it
had
been
something
that
had
made
rowcliffe
desire
not
to
be
seen
or
heard
of
all
the
same
the
vicar
and
his
daughter
alice
were
both
so
profoundly
aware
of
rowcliffe
that
for
five
weeks
they
had
not
mentioned
his
name
to
each
other
when
mary
mentioned
it
on
friday
in
the
evening
of
that
disgraceful
day
he
said
that
he
had
had
enough
of
rowcliffe
and
he
did
want
to
hear
any
more
about
the
fellow
cartaret
had
signified
that
his
second
daughter
name
was
not
to
be
mentioned
either
but
becoming
as
his
attitude
was
he
had
not
been
able
to
keep
it
up
in
the
sixth
week
after
gwenda
departure
he
was
obliged
to
hear
it
was
alice
amazed
out
of
all
reticence
who
told
him
that
gwenda
had
got
a
berth
as
companion
secretary
to
lady
frances
gilbey
at
a
salary
of
a
hundred
a
year
mummy
had
got
it
for
her
you
may
well
stare
molly
but
it
what
she
says
the
vicar
as
if
he
had
believed
ally
capable
of
fabricating
this
intelligence
observed
that
he
would
like
to
see
that
letter
his
face
darkened
as
he
read
it
he
handed
it
back
without
a
word
the
thing
was
not
so
incredible
to
the
vicar
as
it
was
to
mary
he
had
always
known
that
robina
could
pull
wires
it
was
in
fact
through
her
ability
to
pull
wires
that
robina
had
so
successfully
held
him
up
she
had
her
hands
on
the
connections
of
an
entire
social
system
her
superior
ramifications
were
among
those
whom
cartaret
habitually
spoke
and
thought
of
as
the
best
people
and
when
it
came
to
connections
robina
were
of
the
very
best
lady
frances
was
her
second
cousin
in
the
days
when
he
was
trying
to
find
excuses
for
marrying
robina
it
was
in
considering
her
connections
that
he
found
his
finest
the
vicar
had
informed
his
conscience
that
he
was
marrying
robina
because
of
what
she
could
do
for
his
three
motherless
daughters
and
himself
preferment
even
lay
through
the
gilbeys
within
robina
scope
but
to
have
planted
gwenda
on
lady
frances
robina
must
have
pulled
all
the
wires
she
knew
lady
frances
was
a
distinguished
philanthropist
and
a
rigid
evangelical
so
rigid
and
so
distinguished
that
in
the
eyes
of
poor
parsons
waiting
for
preferment
she
constituted
a
pillar
of
the
church
to
the
vicar
as
he
brooded
over
it
robina
act
was
more
than
mere
protection
of
his
daughter
gwenda
not
only
was
it
carrying
the
war
into
the
enemy
camp
with
a
vengeance
it
was
an
act
of
hostility
subtler
and
more
malignant
than
overt
defiance
ever
since
she
left
him
robina
had
been
trying
to
get
hold
of
the
girls
regarding
them
as
the
finest
instruments
in
her
relentless
game
for
it
never
occurred
to
cartaret
that
his
third
movements
could
by
any
possibility
refer
to
anybody
but
himself
robina
according
to
cartaret
was
perpetually
thinking
of
him
and
of
how
she
could
annoy
him
she
had
shown
a
fiendish
cleverness
in
placing
gwenda
with
lady
frances
she
could
have
done
anything
that
could
have
annoyed
him
more
more
than
anything
that
robina
had
yet
done
it
put
him
in
the
wrong
it
put
him
in
the
wrong
not
only
with
lady
frances
and
the
best
people
but
it
put
him
in
the
wrong
with
gwenda
and
kept
him
there
against
gwenda
with
lady
frances
and
a
salary
of
a
hundred
a
year
at
her
back
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
leg
to
stand
on
the
thing
had
the
air
of
justifying
gwenda
behavior
by
its
consequences
that
was
what
robina
had
been
reckoning
on
for
if
it
had
been
gwenda
she
had
been
thinking
of
she
would
have
kept
her
instead
of
handing
her
over
to
lady
frances
the
companion
secretaries
of
that
distinguished
philanthropist
had
no
sinecure
even
at
a
hundred
a
year
as
for
gwenda
accepting
such
a
post
that
proved
nothing
as
against
his
view
of
her
it
only
proved
what
he
had
always
known
that
you
could
never
tell
what
gwenda
would
do
next
and
because
nothing
could
be
said
with
any
dignity
the
vicar
had
said
nothing
as
he
rose
and
went
into
his
study
it
was
there
hidden
from
his
daughters
scrutiny
that
he
pondered
these
things
they
waited
till
the
door
had
closed
on
him
before
they
spoke
well
after
all
that
be
very
jolly
for
her
said
mary
it
is
half
as
jolly
as
it
looks
said
ally
it
means
that
have
to
live
at
tunbridge
wells
oh
said
mary
it
wo
be
all
tunbridge
wells
she
could
bear
to
think
that
it
would
be
all
tunbridge
wells
not
that
she
did
think
it
for
a
moment
it
could
be
all
tunbridge
wells
for
a
girl
like
gwenda
mummy
could
never
have
contemplated
that
gwenda
have
contemplated
it
and
mary
refused
to
contemplate
it
either
she
persuaded
herself
that
what
had
happened
to
her
sister
was
simply
a
piece
of
the
most
amazing
luck
she
even
judged
it
probable
that
gwenda
had
known
very
well
what
she
was
doing
when
she
went
away
besides
she
had
always
wanted
to
do
something
she
had
learned
shorthand
and
typewriting
at
westbourne
as
if
long
ago
she
had
decided
that
if
home
became
insupportable
she
would
leave
it
and
there
had
always
been
that
agreement
between
her
and
mummy
when
mary
put
these
things
together
she
saw
that
nothing
could
be
more
certain
than
that
sooner
or
later
ally
or
no
ally
gwenda
would
have
gone
away
but
this
was
after
it
had
occurred
to
her
that
rowcliffe
ought
to
know
what
had
happened
and
that
she
had
got
to
tell
him
and
that
was
on
the
day
after
gwenda
letter
came
when
gale
having
brought
in
the
paused
in
her
going
to
say
yo
seen
rawcliffe
miss
mary
ey
but
lookin
baad
everybody
said
mary
is
looking
bad
this
muggy
weather
that
reminds
me
how
the
baby
woorse
again
miss
i
tall
assy
she
navver
rear
has
the
doctor
seen
him
naw
naw
nat
yat
but
look
in
saays
afore
goas
mary
looked
at
the
clock
rowcliffe
left
the
surgery
at
it
was
now
five
minutes
past
she
wondered
did
he
know
then
or
did
he
not
know
would
gwenda
have
written
to
him
was
it
because
she
had
not
written
that
he
was
looking
bad
or
was
it
because
she
had
written
and
he
knew
she
thought
and
thought
it
over
and
under
all
her
thinking
there
lurked
the
desire
to
know
whether
rowcliffe
knew
and
how
he
was
taking
it
and
under
her
desire
the
longing
imperious
and
irresistible
to
see
him
she
would
have
to
ask
him
to
the
house
she
had
not
forgotten
that
she
had
to
ask
him
that
she
was
pledged
to
ask
him
on
ally
account
if
as
gwenda
had
put
it
she
was
to
play
the
game
but
she
had
had
more
than
one
motive
for
her
delay
it
would
look
better
if
she
were
not
in
too
great
a
hurry
she
said
to
herself
it
would
look
better
on
ally
account
the
longer
he
was
kept
away
she
said
to
herself
that
he
was
kept
away
from
ally
the
more
he
would
be
likely
to
want
to
come
sufficient
time
must
elapse
to
allow
of
his
forgetting
gwenda
it
was
not
well
that
he
should
be
thinking
all
the
time
of
gwenda
when
he
came
she
said
to
herself
it
was
not
well
on
ally
account
and
it
was
well
that
their
father
should
have
forgotten
rowcliffe
this
on
ally
account
too
for
of
course
it
was
only
on
ally
account
that
she
was
asking
rowcliffe
really
not
that
there
seemed
to
be
any
such
awful
need
for
ally
in
those
five
weeks
had
got
gradually
better
and
now
in
the
first
week
of
may
which
had
always
been
one
of
her
bad
months
she
was
marvelously
well
it
looked
as
if
gwenda
had
known
what
she
was
talking
about
when
she
said
ally
would
be
all
right
when
she
was
gone
and
of
course
it
was
just
as
well
on
ally
account
that
rowcliffe
should
not
have
seen
her
until
she
was
absolutely
well
nobody
could
say
that
she
mary
was
not
doing
it
beautifully
nobody
could
say
she
was
not
discreet
since
she
had
let
five
weeks
pass
before
she
asked
him
and
in
order
that
her
asking
him
should
have
the
air
of
happy
chance
she
must
somehow
contrive
to
see
him
first
her
seeing
him
could
be
managed
any
wednesday
in
the
village
it
was
bound
in
fact
to
occur
the
wonder
was
that
it
had
not
occurred
before
well
that
showed
how
hard
all
these
weeks
she
had
been
trying
not
to
see
him
if
she
had
had
an
uneasy
conscience
in
the
matter
and
she
said
to
herself
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
one
it
would
have
acquitted
her
nobody
could
say
she
was
playing
the
game
and
then
it
struck
her
that
she
had
better
go
down
at
once
and
see
essy
baby
it
was
only
five
and
twenty
past
four
xli
the
vicar
was
right
rowcliffe
did
not
want
to
be
seen
or
heard
of
at
the
vicarage
he
did
not
want
to
see
or
hear
of
the
vicarage
or
of
gwenda
cartaret
again
twice
a
week
or
more
in
those
five
weeks
he
had
to
pass
the
little
gray
house
above
the
churchyard
twice
a
week
or
more
the
small
shy
window
in
its
gable
end
looked
sidelong
at
him
as
he
went
by
but
he
always
pretended
not
to
see
it
and
if
anybody
in
the
village
spoke
to
him
of
gwenda
cartaret
he
pretended
not
to
hear
so
that
presently
they
left
off
speaking
he
had
sighted
mary
cartaret
two
or
three
times
in
the
village
and
once
on
the
moor
below
upthorne
a
figure
that
he
recognised
as
alice
he
had
also
overtaken
mary
on
her
bicycle
and
once
he
had
seen
her
at
a
shop
door
on
morfe
green
and
each
time
mary
absorbed
in
what
she
was
doing
had
made
it
possible
for
him
not
to
see
her
he
was
grateful
to
her
for
her
absorption
while
he
saw
through
it
he
had
always
known
that
mary
was
a
person
of
tact
he
also
knew
that
this
preposterous
avoidance
could
not
go
on
forever
it
was
only
that
mary
gave
him
a
blessed
respite
week
by
week
presently
one
or
other
of
the
two
would
have
to
end
it
and
he
yet
know
which
of
them
it
would
be
he
rather
thought
it
would
be
mary
and
it
mary
he
met
her
that
first
wednesday
in
may
as
he
was
leaving
cottage
she
was
coming
along
the
narrow
path
by
the
beck
and
there
was
no
avoiding
her
she
came
toward
him
smiling
he
had
always
rather
liked
her
smile
it
was
quiet
it
never
broke
up
as
it
were
her
brooding
face
he
had
noticed
that
it
did
even
part
her
lips
or
make
them
thinner
if
anything
it
made
them
thicker
it
curved
still
more
the
crushed
bow
of
the
upper
lip
and
the
pensive
sweep
of
the
lower
but
it
opened
doors
it
lit
lights
it
broadened
quite
curiously
the
rather
too
broad
nostrils
it
set
the
wide
eyes
wider
it
brought
a
sudden
blue
into
their
thick
gray
in
her
cheeks
it
caused
a
sudden
leaping
and
spreading
of
their
flame
her
rather
high
and
rather
prominent
gave
character
and
a
curious
charm
to
mary
face
they
had
the
effect
of
lifting
her
bloom
directly
under
the
pure
and
candid
gray
of
her
eyes
leaving
her
red
mouth
alone
in
its
dominion
that
mouth
with
its
rather
too
long
upper
lip
and
its
almost
perpetual
brooding
was
saved
from
immobility
by
its
alliance
with
her
nostrils
such
was
mary
face
rowcliffe
had
often
watched
it
acknowledging
its
charm
while
he
said
to
himself
that
for
him
it
could
never
have
any
meaning
or
fascination
any
more
than
mary
could
there
much
in
mary
face
and
there
was
much
in
mary
she
was
too
ruminant
too
tranquil
he
sometimes
wondered
how
much
it
would
take
to
trouble
her
and
yet
there
were
times
when
that
tranquillity
was
soothing
she
had
always
even
when
ally
was
at
her
worst
smiled
at
him
as
if
nothing
had
happened
or
could
happen
and
she
smiled
at
him
as
if
nothing
had
happened
now
and
it
struck
rowcliffe
as
it
had
frequently
struck
him
before
how
good
her
face
was
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
and
looked
at
him
and
as
if
only
then
she
had
seen
in
his
face
the
signs
of
a
suffering
she
had
been
unaware
of
her
eyes
rounded
in
a
sudden
wonder
of
distress
they
said
in
their
goodness
and
their
candor
oh
i
see
how
horribly
you
suffered
i
did
know
and
i
so
sorry
then
they
looked
away
and
it
was
like
the
quiet
withdrawal
of
a
hand
that
feared
lest
in
touching
it
should
hurt
him
mary
began
to
talk
of
the
weather
and
of
essy
and
of
essy
baby
as
if
her
eyes
had
never
seen
anything
at
all
then
just
as
they
parted
she
said
when
are
you
coming
to
see
us
again
as
if
he
had
been
to
see
them
only
the
other
day
he
said
he
come
as
soon
as
he
was
asked
and
mary
reflected
as
one
arranging
a
multitude
of
engagements
well
then
let
me
see
can
you
come
to
tea
on
friday
or
monday
father
be
at
home
both
days
and
rowcliffe
said
thanks
he
come
on
friday
mary
went
on
to
the
cottage
and
rowcliffe
to
his
surgery
he
wondered
why
she
had
said
a
word
about
gwenda
he
supposed
it
was
because
she
knew
that
there
was
nothing
she
could
say
that
would
not
hurt
him
and
he
said
to
himself
what
a
nice
girl
she
is
what
a
thoroughly
nice
girl
but
what
he
wanted
though
he
dreaded
it
was
news
of
gwenda
he
did
know
whether
he
could
bring
himself
to
ask
for
it
but
he
rather
thought
that
mary
would
know
what
he
wanted
and
give
it
him
without
his
asking
that
was
precisely
what
mary
knew
and
did
she
was
ready
for
him
alone
in
the
gray
and
amber
and
she
did
it
almost
at
once
before
alice
or
her
father
could
come
in
alice
was
out
walking
she
said
and
her
father
was
in
the
study
they
would
be
in
soon
she
thus
made
rowcliffe
realise
that
if
she
was
going
to
be
abrupt
it
was
because
she
had
to
be
they
had
both
of
them
such
a
short
time
with
admirable
tact
she
assumed
rowcliffe
interest
in
ally
and
the
vicar
it
made
it
easier
to
begin
about
gwenda
and
before
she
began
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
better
first
find
out
if
he
knew
so
she
asked
him
if
he
had
heard
from
gwenda
no
he
said
at
her
name
he
had
winced
visibly
but
there
was
hope
even
in
his
hurt
eyes
it
sprang
from
mary
taking
it
for
granted
that
he
would
be
likely
to
hear
from
her
sister
we
only
heard
really
said
mary
the
other
day
is
that
so
of
course
she
wrote
but
she
did
say
much
because
at
first
afraid
there
was
very
much
to
say
and
is
there
rowcliffe
hands
were
trembling
slightly
mary
looked
down
at
them
and
away
well
yes
and
she
told
him
that
gwenda
had
got
a
secretaryship
to
lady
frances
gilbey
it
would
have
been
too
gross
to
have
told
him
about
gwenda
salary
but
it
might
have
been
the
salary
she
was
thinking
of
when
she
added
that
it
was
of
course
an
awfully
good
thing
for
gwenda
and
who
said
rowcliffe
is
lady
frances
gilbey
she
a
cousin
of
my
stepmother
he
considered
it
and
er
cartaret
lives
in
london
does
she
oh
yes
mary
tone
implied
that
you
could
expect
that
brilliant
lady
to
live
anywhere
else
there
was
a
moment
in
which
rowcliffe
again
evoked
the
image
of
the
third
cartaret
who
was
the
very
one
if
anything
could
have
depressed
him
more
that
did
but
he
pulled
himself
together
there
were
things
he
had
to
know
and
does
your
sister
like
living
in
london
mary
smiled
i
imagine
she
does
very
much
indeed
somehow
said
rowcliffe
i
ca
see
her
there
i
thought
she
liked
the
country
oh
you
never
can
tell
whether
gwenda
really
likes
anything
she
may
have
liked
it
she
may
have
liked
it
awfully
but
she
could
go
on
liking
it
forever
and
to
rowcliffe
it
was
as
if
mary
had
said
that
was
gwenda
way
there
no
doubt
she
done
the
best
thing
for
herself
i
mean
rowcliffe
assented
perhaps
she
has
and
mary
as
if
doubt
had
only
just
occurred
to
her
made
a
sudden
little
tremulous
appeal
you
do
really
think
garth
was
the
place
for
her
i
do
really
think
anything
about
it
rowcliffe
said
mary
was
pensive
her
brooding
look
said
that
she
laid
a
secret
fear
to
rest
garth
could
satisfy
a
girl
like
gwenda
rowcliffe
said
no
he
supposed
it
could
satisfy
her
his
dejection
was
by
this
time
terrible
it
cast
a
visible
a
palpable
gloom
she
a
restless
creature
said
mary
smiling
she
threw
it
out
as
if
by
way
of
lightening
his
oppression
almost
as
if
she
put
it
to
him
that
if
gwenda
was
restless
by
which
rowcliffe
might
understand
if
he
liked
capricious
she
could
help
it
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
be
so
horribly
hurt
it
was
not
as
if
there
was
anything
personal
in
gwenda
changing
attitudes
and
rowcliffe
did
indeed
say
to
himself
restless
restless
yes
that
was
the
word
for
her
and
he
supposed
she
could
help
it
the
study
door
opened
and
shut
mary
eyes
made
a
sign
to
him
that
said
we
ca
talk
about
this
before
my
father
he
wo
like
it
but
cartaret
had
gone
upstairs
they
could
hear
him
moving
in
the
room
overhead
how
is
your
other
sister
getting
on
said
rowcliffe
abruptly
alice
she
all
right
you
would
know
her
she
can
walk
for
miles
you
do
say
so
he
was
really
astonished
she
off
now
somewhere
goodness
knows
where
ha
rowcliffe
laughed
softly
it
really
wonderful
said
mary
she
generally
so
tired
in
the
spring
it
wonderful
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
wonderful
it
was
oh
well
he
said
she
must
overdo
it
it
was
mary
he
suspected
of
overdoing
it
on
ally
account
of
course
it
was
likely
that
she
would
give
the
poor
child
away
at
that
point
gale
came
in
with
the
and
presently
the
vicar
came
down
to
tea
he
was
more
than
courteous
this
time
he
was
affable
he
too
greeted
rowcliffe
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
he
abstained
from
any
reference
to
gwenda
but
he
showed
a
certain
serenity
in
his
restraint
leaning
back
in
his
armchair
his
legs
crossed
his
hands
joined
lightly
at
the
his
forehead
smoothed
conversing
affably
cartaret
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
might
indeed
have
suffered
through
his
outrageous
family
but
for
whom
suffering
was
passed
a
man
without
any
trouble
or
anxiety
and
serenity
without
the
memory
of
suffering
was
in
mary
good
and
happy
face
the
house
was
very
still
it
seemed
the
stillness
of
life
that
ran
evenly
and
with
no
sound
and
it
was
borne
in
upon
rowcliffe
as
he
sat
there
and
talked
to
them
that
this
quiet
and
tranquillity
had
come
to
them
with
gwenda
going
she
was
a
restless
creature
and
she
had
infected
them
with
her
unrest
they
had
peace
from
her
now
only
for
him
there
could
be
no
peace
from
gwenda
he
could
feel
her
in
the
room
through
the
open
door
she
came
and
went
restless
restless
he
put
the
thought
of
her
from
him
after
tea
the
vicar
took
him
into
his
study
if
rowcliffe
had
a
moment
to
spare
he
would
like
he
said
to
talk
to
him
rowcliffe
looked
at
his
watch
the
idea
of
being
talked
to
frightened
him
the
vicar
observed
his
nervousness
it
about
my
daughter
alice
he
said
and
it
was
the
vicar
wanted
him
to
know
and
he
had
brought
him
into
his
study
in
order
to
tell
him
that
alice
had
completely
recovered
he
went
into
it
the
girl
was
fit
she
was
happy
she
ate
well
she
slept
well
he
had
kept
her
under
very
careful
supervision
and
she
could
walk
for
miles
she
was
in
fact
leading
the
healthy
natural
life
he
had
hoped
she
would
lead
when
he
brought
her
into
a
more
bracing
climate
rowcliffe
expressed
his
wonder
it
was
he
said
wonderful
but
the
vicar
would
not
admit
that
it
was
wonderful
at
all
it
was
exactly
what
he
had
expected
he
had
never
thought
for
a
moment
that
there
was
anything
seriously
wrong
with
alice
anything
indeed
in
the
least
the
matter
with
her
rowcliffe
was
silent
but
he
looked
at
the
vicar
and
the
vicar
did
not
even
pretend
not
to
understand
his
look
i
know
he
said
the
very
serious
view
you
took
of
her
but
i
think
my
dear
fellow
when
you
seen
her
you
admit
that
you
were
mistaken
rowcliffe
said
there
was
nothing
he
desired
more
than
to
have
been
mistaken
but
he
was
afraid
he
could
admit
it
miss
state
when
he
last
saw
her
had
been
distinctly
serious
you
will
perhaps
admit
that
whatever
danger
there
may
have
been
then
is
over
i
have
seen
her
yet
said
rowcliffe
but
he
looked
at
him
i
told
you
the
thing
was
curable
that
my
point
what
is
there
what
can
there
have
been
to
cure
her
rowcliffe
ignored
the
vicar
point
can
you
date
it
this
recovery
i
date
it
said
the
vicar
from
the
time
her
sister
left
she
seemed
to
pull
herself
together
after
that
rowcliffe
said
nothing
he
was
reviewing
all
his
knowledge
of
the
case
he
considered
ally
disastrous
infatuation
for
himself
in
the
light
of
his
knowledge
her
recovery
was
not
only
wonderful
it
was
incomprehensible
so
incomprehensible
that
he
was
inclined
to
suspect
her
father
of
lying
for
some
reason
of
his
own
family
pride
no
doubt
he
had
known
instances
the
vicar
went
on
he
gave
himself
a
long
innings
but
that
does
not
account
for
it
altogether
though
it
may
have
started
it
i
really
put
it
down
to
other
things
the
pure
air
the
quiet
life
the
absence
of
excitement
the
regular
that
her
of
herself
here
the
vicar
fell
into
that
solemn
rhythm
that
marked
the
periods
of
his
sermons
he
perorated
the
following
of
prescription
you
will
remember
he
became
suddenly
cheery
and
conversational
that
it
mine
it
certainly
was
mine
said
rowcliffe
he
saw
it
all
was
why
the
vicar
was
so
affable
that
was
why
he
was
so
serene
and
he
was
lying
his
state
of
mind
was
obviously
much
too
simple
he
was
serenely
certain
of
his
facts
by
courteous
movement
of
his
hand
the
vicar
condoned
rudeness
which
he
attributed
to
professional
pique
very
natural
in
the
circumstances
with
admirable
tact
he
changed
the
subject
i
also
wished
to
consult
you
about
another
matter
nothing
he
again
reassured
the
doctor
nervousness
to
do
with
my
family
rowcliffe
was
all
attention
it
about
it
about
that
poor
girl
essy
gale
essy
said
rowcliffe
is
very
well
and
very
happy
the
vicar
sudden
rigidity
implied
that
essy
had
no
business
to
be
happy
if
she
is
it
is
your
friend
greatorex
fault
i
not
so
sure
of
that
said
rowcliffe
i
suppose
you
know
he
has
refused
to
marry
her
i
understood
as
much
but
who
asked
him
to
i
did
my
dear
sir
if
you
do
mind
my
saying
so
i
think
you
made
a
mistake
if
you
him
to
marry
her
you
know
what
he
is
i
do
indeed
but
a
certain
responsibility
rests
with
the
parson
of
the
parish
you
ca
be
responsible
for
everything
that
goes
on
perhaps
not
when
the
place
is
packed
with
nonconformists
greatorex
comes
of
bad
dissenting
stock
i
ca
hope
to
have
any
influence
with
him
he
paused
but
i
told
that
have
influence
not
i
a
sneaking
regard
for
greatorex
he
is
half
a
bad
fellow
if
you
take
him
the
right
way
well
then
ca
you
take
him
ca
you
say
a
judicious
word
if
it
to
ask
him
to
marry
essy
that
would
be
very
judicious
i
afraid
he
marry
her
if
he
wants
to
and
if
he
does
he
wo
but
my
dear
rowcliffe
think
of
the
gross
injustice
to
that
poor
girl
it
might
be
a
worse
injustice
if
he
married
her
why
he
marry
her
if
he
does
want
to
and
if
she
does
want
it
there
she
is
perfectly
content
and
happy
with
her
baby
it
been
a
little
seedy
lately
but
it
absolutely
sound
a
very
fine
baby
indeed
and
essy
knows
it
there
nothing
wrong
with
the
baby
rowcliffe
continued
regardless
of
the
vicar
stare
better
off
as
she
is
than
tied
to
a
chap
who
is
a
bit
too
sober
especially
if
he
does
care
for
her
the
vicar
rose
and
took
up
his
usual
defensive
position
on
the
hearth
well
rowcliffe
if
those
are
your
ideas
of
morality
they
are
not
my
ideas
of
morality
only
my
judgment
of
the
individual
case
well
if
that
your
judgment
after
all
i
think
that
the
less
you
meddle
with
it
the
better
i
never
meddle
said
rowcliffe
but
the
vicar
did
not
leave
him
he
had
caught
the
sound
of
the
opening
and
shutting
of
the
gate
he
listened
his
manner
changed
again
to
a
complete
affability
i
think
that
alice
i
should
like
you
to
see
her
if
you
rowcliffe
gathered
that
the
entrance
of
alice
had
better
coincide
with
his
departure
he
followed
the
vicar
as
he
went
to
open
the
front
door
alice
stood
on
the
doorstep
she
was
not
at
first
aware
of
him
where
he
lingered
in
the
at
the
end
of
the
passage
alice
said
the
vicar
rowcliffe
is
here
you
just
in
time
to
say
to
him
it
a
pity
if
it
said
alice
her
voice
might
have
been
the
voice
of
a
young
woman
who
is
sanely
and
innocently
gay
but
to
rowcliffe
ear
there
was
a
sound
of
exaltation
in
it
he
could
see
her
now
clearly
in
the
light
of
the
open
door
the
vicar
had
not
lied
alice
had
all
the
appearances
of
health
something
had
almost
cured
her
but
not
quite
as
she
stood
there
with
him
in
the
doorway
chattering
rowcliffe
was
struck
again
with
the
excitement
of
her
voice
and
manner
imperfectly
restrained
and
with
the
quivering
glitter
of
her
eyes
by
these
signs
he
gathered
that
if
alice
was
happy
her
happiness
was
not
complete
it
was
not
happiness
in
his
sense
of
the
word
but
alice
face
was
unmistakably
the
face
of
hope
whatever
it
was
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
he
saw
that
eyes
faced
him
now
with
the
light
unseeing
look
of
indifference
and
that
they
turned
every
second
toward
the
wall
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
she
was
listening
to
something
he
was
then
aware
of
footsteps
on
the
road
they
came
down
the
hill
passing
close
under
the
vicarage
wall
and
turning
where
it
turned
to
skirt
the
little
lane
at
the
bottom
between
the
garden
and
the
churchyard
the
lane
led
to
the
pastures
and
the
pastures
to
the
manor
and
from
the
manor
grounds
a
field
track
trailed
to
a
small
wicket
gate
on
the
north
side
of
the
churchyard
wall
a
flagged
path
went
from
the
wicket
to
the
door
of
the
north
transept
it
was
a
short
cut
for
the
lord
of
the
manor
to
his
seat
in
the
chancel
but
it
was
not
the
nearest
way
for
anybody
approaching
the
church
from
the
high
road
now
the
slope
of
the
vicarage
garden
followed
the
slope
of
the
road
in
such
wise
that
a
person
entering
the
churchyard
from
the
high
road
could
be
seen
from
the
windows
of
the
vicarage
if
that
person
desired
to
remain
unseen
his
only
chance
was
to
go
round
by
the
lane
to
the
wicket
gate
keeping
close
under
the
garden
wall
rowcliffe
heard
the
wicket
gate
click
softly
as
it
was
softly
opened
and
shut
and
he
could
have
sworn
that
alice
heard
it
too
he
waited
twenty
minutes
or
so
in
his
surgery
then
instead
of
sending
at
once
to
the
red
lion
for
his
trap
he
walked
back
to
the
church
standing
in
the
churchyard
he
could
hear
the
sound
of
the
organ
and
of
a
man
voice
singing
he
opened
the
big
west
door
softly
and
went
softly
in
xlii
there
is
no
in
garth
church
the
one
aisle
down
the
middle
of
the
nave
goes
straight
from
the
west
door
to
the
standing
by
the
west
door
behind
the
font
rowcliffe
had
an
uninterrupted
view
of
the
chancel
the
organ
was
behind
the
choir
stalls
on
the
north
side
alice
was
seated
at
the
organ
jim
greatorex
stood
behind
her
and
so
that
his
face
was
turned
slantwise
toward
rowcliffe
alice
face
was
in
pure
profile
her
head
was
tilted
slightly
backward
as
if
the
music
lifted
it
rowcliffe
moved
softly
to
the
sexton
bench
in
the
left
hand
corner
sitting
there
he
could
see
her
better
and
ran
less
risk
of
being
seen
the
dull
stained
glass
of
the
east
window
dimmed
the
light
at
that
end
of
the
church
the
organ
candles
were
lit
their
jointed
brackets
brought
forward
on
each
side
threw
light
on
the
music
book
and
the
keys
also
on
the
faces
of
alice
and
greatorex
he
stood
so
close
to
her
as
almost
to
touch
her
she
had
taken
off
her
hat
and
her
hair
showed
gold
against
the
drab
of
his
on
both
faces
there
was
a
look
of
ecstasy
it
was
essentially
the
same
ecstasy
only
on
alice
face
it
was
more
luminous
more
conscious
and
at
the
same
time
more
abandoned
as
if
all
subterfuge
had
ceased
in
her
and
she
gave
herself
up
willing
and
exulting
to
the
unspiritual
sense
that
flooded
her
on
the
man
face
this
look
was
more
confused
it
was
also
more
tender
and
more
poignant
as
if
in
soaring
jim
rapture
gave
him
pain
you
would
have
said
that
he
had
not
given
himself
to
it
but
that
he
was
driven
by
it
and
that
yet
with
all
its
sensuous
trouble
there
ran
through
it
secret
and
profoundly
pure
some
strain
of
spiritual
longing
and
in
his
thick
his
poignant
and
tender
greatorex
sang
the
soon
was
set
the
sick
oh
thee
laay
oh
with
what
divers
pains
they
met
and
with
what
joy
they
went
but
alice
stopped
playing
and
rowcliffe
heard
her
say
do
have
that
one
jim
i
do
like
it
it
might
have
passed
even
the
name
but
that
rowcliffe
saw
greatorex
put
his
hand
on
alice
head
and
stroke
her
hair
then
he
heard
him
say
let
mine
and
he
saw
that
his
hand
was
on
alice
shoulders
as
he
leaned
over
her
to
find
the
hymn
good
god
said
rowcliffe
to
himself
that
explains
it
he
got
up
softly
now
that
he
knew
he
felt
that
it
was
horrible
to
spy
on
her
but
greatorex
had
begun
singing
again
and
the
sheer
beauty
of
the
voice
held
rowcliffe
there
to
listen
kindly
light
amidst
th
encircling
lead
thou
me
keep
thou
my
feet
i
do
not
ther
scene
woon
step
for
greatorex
was
singing
like
an
angel
and
as
he
sang
it
was
as
if
two
passions
two
longings
the
earthly
and
the
heavenly
met
and
mingled
in
him
so
that
through
all
its
emotion
his
face
remained
incongruously
mystic
queerly
visionary
moor
and
fen
crag
and
torrent
the
evocation
was
intolerable
to
rowcliffe
he
turned
away
and
greatorex
voice
went
after
him
with
the
morn
angel
smile
which
looved
long
since
and
again
rowcliffe
turned
but
not
before
he
had
seen
that
greatorex
had
his
hand
on
alice
shoulder
a
second
time
and
that
alice
hand
had
gone
up
and
found
it
there
the
latch
of
the
west
door
jerked
under
rowcliffe
hand
with
a
loud
clashing
alice
and
greatorex
looked
round
and
saw
him
as
he
went
out
alice
got
up
in
terror
the
two
stood
apart
on
either
side
of
the
organ
bench
staring
into
each
other
faces
then
alice
went
round
to
the
back
of
the
organ
and
addressed
the
small
go
she
said
and
tell
the
choir
we
waiting
for
them
it
five
minutes
past
time
johnny
ran
alice
went
back
to
the
chancel
where
greatorex
stood
turning
over
the
hymn
books
of
the
choir
jim
she
said
that
was
rowcliffe
do
you
think
he
saw
us
it
does
matter
if
he
did
said
greatorex
he
not
tell
he
might
tell
father
jim
turned
to
her
and
if
he
doos
ally
yo
knaw
what
to
saay
that
no
good
jim
i
told
you
so
you
must
think
of
it
i
shall
think
of
it
i
shall
think
of
noothing
else
said
greatorex
the
choir
came
in
aggrieved
and
explaining
that
it
was
six
yet
not
by
the
church
clock
xliii
as
rowcliffe
went
back
to
his
surgery
he
recalled
two
things
he
had
forgotten
one
was
a
little
gray
figure
he
had
seen
once
or
twice
lately
wandering
through
the
fields
about
upthorne
farm
the
other
was
a
certain
interview
he
had
had
with
alice
when
she
had
come
to
ask
him
to
get
greatorex
to
sing
that
was
in
november
not
long
before
the
concert
he
remembered
the
suggestion
he
had
then
made
that
alice
should
turn
her
attention
to
reclaiming
greatorex
and
though
he
had
no
morbid
sense
of
responsibility
in
the
matter
it
struck
him
with
something
like
compunction
that
he
had
put
greatorex
into
alice
head
chiefly
to
distract
her
from
throwing
herself
at
his
and
then
he
had
gone
and
forgotten
all
about
it
he
told
himself
now
that
he
had
been
a
fool
not
to
think
of
it
and
if
he
was
a
fool
what
was
to
be
said
of
the
vicar
under
whose
nose
this
singular
form
of
choir
practice
had
been
going
on
for
goodness
knew
how
long
it
did
not
occur
to
the
doctor
that
if
his
surgery
day
had
been
a
friday
which
was
choir
practice
day
he
would
have
been
certain
to
have
thought
of
it
neither
was
he
aware
that
what
he
had
observed
this
evening
was
only
the
unforeseen
result
of
a
perfectly
innocent
parochial
arrangement
it
had
begun
at
christmas
and
again
at
easter
when
it
was
understood
that
greatorex
who
was
nervous
about
his
voice
should
turn
up
for
practice
ten
minutes
before
the
rest
of
the
choir
to
try
over
his
part
in
an
anthem
or
cantata
so
that
as
alice
said
he
might
do
himself
justice
since
easter
the
ten
minutes
had
grown
to
fifteen
or
even
twenty
and
twice
in
the
last
three
weeks
greatorex
by
collusion
with
alice
had
arrived
a
whole
hour
before
his
time
still
there
was
nothing
in
this
circumstance
itself
to
alarm
the
vicar
choir
practice
was
choir
practice
a
mysterious
thing
he
never
interfered
with
knowing
himself
to
be
unmusical
rowcliffe
had
had
good
reason
for
refusing
to
urge
greatorex
to
marry
essy
gale
but
what
he
had
seen
in
garth
church
made
him
determined
to
say
something
to
greatorex
after
all
he
went
on
his
northerly
round
the
very
next
sunday
and
timed
it
so
that
he
overtook
his
man
on
his
way
home
from
church
he
gave
greatorex
a
lift
with
the
result
which
he
had
calculated
that
greatorex
gave
him
dinner
as
he
had
done
once
or
twice
before
the
pipe
made
jim
peculiarly
approachable
and
rowcliffe
approached
him
suddenly
and
directly
i
say
greatorex
why
do
you
marry
not
a
bad
thing
for
you
you
know
ay
saw
they
tall
me
said
greatorex
amicably
rowcliffe
went
on
to
advise
his
marrying
essy
not
on
the
grounds
of
morality
or
of
justice
to
the
girl
he
was
a
tactful
person
but
on
greatorex
account
as
the
best
thing
greatorex
could
do
for
himself
yo
mane
said
greatorex
i
ought
to
marry
her
rowcliffe
said
no
he
was
going
into
that
greatorex
was
profoundly
thoughtful
presently
he
said
that
he
would
speak
to
essy
he
spoke
to
her
that
afternoon
in
the
cottage
down
by
the
beck
essy
sat
by
the
hearth
nursing
her
baby
he
had
recovered
from
his
ailment
and
lay
in
her
lap
gurgling
and
squinting
at
the
fire
he
wore
the
robe
that
gale
had
brought
to
essy
five
months
ago
essy
had
turned
it
up
above
his
knees
and
smiling
softly
she
watched
his
little
pink
feet
curling
and
uncurling
as
she
held
them
to
the
fire
essy
back
and
the
back
of
the
head
were
toward
the
door
which
stood
open
the
day
being
still
warm
greatorex
stood
there
a
moment
looking
at
them
before
he
tapped
on
the
door
he
felt
no
tenderness
for
either
of
them
only
a
sullen
pity
that
was
half
resentment
as
if
she
had
heard
his
footsteps
and
known
them
essy
spoke
without
looking
round
yo

he
smiled
mournfully
poor
essy
he
said
she
gave
him
a
queer
look
yo
needn
pity
she
said
he
went
away
considerably
relieved
in
his
mind
but
still
suffering
that
sullen
uneasiness
in
his
soul
xliv
it
was
the
last
week
in
june
mary
cartaret
sat
in
the
door
of
the
cottage
by
the
beck
and
in
her
lap
she
held
essy
baby
essy
had
run
in
to
the
last
cottage
in
the
row
to
look
after
her
great
aunt
the
widow
gale
who
had
fallen
out
of
bed
in
the
night
the
widow
gale
in
her
solitude
had
formed
the
habit
of
falling
out
of
bed
but
this
time
she
had
hurt
her
head
and
essy
had
gone
for
the
doctor
and
had
met
miss
mary
in
the
village
and
mary
had
come
with
her
to
help
for
by
good
luck
better
luck
than
the
widow
gale
deserved
it
was
a
wednesday
rowcliffe
had
sent
word
that
he
would
come
at
three
it
was
three
now
and
as
he
passed
along
the
narrow
path
he
saw
mary
cartaret
in
the
doorway
with
the
baby
in
her
lap
she
smiled
at
him
as
he
went
by
i
making
myself
useful
she
said
oh
more
than
that
his
impression
was
that
mary
had
made
herself
beautiful
he
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
and
laughed
as
he
hurried
on
up
till
now
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
mary
could
be
beautiful
but
it
did
puzzle
him
he
knew
how
she
had
achieved
that
momentary
effect
he
knew
and
he
was
to
remember
for
the
effect
repeated
itself
as
he
came
back
mary
was
standing
in
the
path
holding
the
baby
in
her
arms
she
was
looking
she
said
for
essy
would
essy
be
coming
soon
rowcliffe
did
not
answer
all
at
once
he
stood
contemplating
the
picture
it
was
all
mary
the
baby
did
his
part
he
had
been
that
month
and
his
thighs
crushed
and
delicately
creased
showed
rose
red
against
the
white
rose
of
mary
arm
she
leaned
her
head
brooding
tenderly
to
his
and
his
head
he
was
a
dark
baby
was
dusk
to
her
flame
rowcliffe
smiled
why
he
said
do
you
want
to
get
rid
of
him
as
if
unconsciously
she
pressed
the
child
closer
to
her
as
if
unconsciously
she
held
his
head
against
her
breast
and
when
his
fingers
worked
there
in
their
way
she
covered
them
with
her
hand
no
she
said
he
a
nice
baby
are
you
a
nice
baby
there
essy
unhappy
because
he
going
to
have
blue
eyes
and
dark
hair
but
i
think
they
the
prettiest
do
you
yes
said
rowcliffe
he
was
grave
and
curt
and
mary
remembered
that
that
was
what
gwenda
had
blue
eyes
and
dark
hair
it
was
what
gwenda
children
might
have
had
too
she
felt
that
she
had
made
him
think
of
gwenda
then
essy
came
and
took
the
baby
from
her
too
fer
yo
miss
she
said
she
laughed
as
she
took
him
she
gazed
at
him
with
pride
and
affection
unabashed
his
one
fault
for
essy
was
that
though
he
had
got
greatorex
eyes
he
had
not
got
greatorex
hair
mary
and
rowcliffe
went
back
together
you
coming
in
to
tea
are
you
she
said
rather
he
had
got
into
the
habit
again
of
looking
in
at
the
vicarage
for
tea
every
wednesday
they
were
having
tea
in
the
orchard
now
and
in
june
the
vicarage
orchard
was
a
pleasanter
place
than
the
surgery
it
was
in
fact
a
very
pleasant
place
pleasanter
than
the
gray
and
amber
when
rowcliffe
came
to
think
of
it
he
owed
the
cartarets
many
pleasant
things
so
he
had
formed
another
habit
of
asking
them
back
to
tea
in
his
orchard
he
had
had
no
idea
what
a
pleasant
place
his
orchard
could
be
too
now
though
rowcliffe
nearly
always
had
tea
alone
with
mary
at
the
vicarage
mary
never
came
to
tea
at
rowcliffe
house
alone
she
always
brought
alice
with
her
and
rowcliffe
found
that
a
nuisance
for
one
thing
alice
had
the
air
of
being
dragged
there
against
her
will
so
completely
had
she
recovered
from
him
for
another
he
could
talk
to
mary
quite
so
well
he
did
know
that
he
wanted
to
talk
to
mary
he
did
know
that
he
particularly
wanted
to
be
alone
with
her
but
somehow
alice
being
there
made
him
want
it
he
was
to
be
alone
with
mary
in
the
orchard
the
window
of
the
vicar
study
raked
the
orchard
but
that
matter
for
the
vicar
was
not
at
home
this
wednesday
the
orchard
waited
for
them
two
armchairs
and
the
little
round
were
set
out
under
the
trees
mary
knitting
lay
in
one
of
the
chairs
she
had
the
habit
of
knitting
while
she
talked
or
while
rowcliffe
talked
and
she
listened
the
act
of
knitting
disposed
her
to
long
silences
it
also
occupied
her
so
that
rowcliffe
when
he
liked
could
be
silent
too
but
generally
he
talked
and
mary
listened
they
had
many
subjects
but
mary
made
the
most
of
what
they
had
and
she
always
knew
the
precise
moment
when
rowcliffe
had
ceased
to
be
interested
in
any
one
of
them
she
knew
as
if
by
instinct
all
his
moments
they
were
talking
now
at
about
the
widow
gale
mary
wanted
to
know
how
the
poor
thing
was
getting
on
the
widow
gale
had
been
rather
badly
shaken
and
she
had
bruised
her
poor
old
head
and
one
hip
but
she
would
fall
out
of
bed
again
rowcliffe
had
barricaded
the
bed
with
a
chest
of
drawers
afterward
there
must
be
a
rail
or
something
mary
was
interested
in
the
widow
gale
as
long
as
rowcliffe
liked
to
talk
about
her
but
the
widow
gale
did
carry
them
very
far
what
would
have
carried
them
far
was
rowcliffe
himself
but
rowcliffe
never
wanted
to
talk
about
himself
to
mary
when
mary
tried
to
lead
gently
up
to
him
rowcliffe
shied
he
would
talk
about
himself
any
more
than
he
would
talk
about
gwenda
but
mary
did
want
to
talk
about
gwenda
either
now
so
that
her
face
showed
the
faintest
flicker
of
dismay
when
rowcliffe
suddenly
began
to
talk
about
her
have
you
any
idea
he
said
when
your
sister
coming
back
she
wo
be
long
said
mary
she
only
gone
to
upthorne
village
i
meant
your
other
sister
oh
gwenda
mary
brooded
and
the
impression
her
brooding
made
on
rowcliffe
was
that
mary
knew
something
about
gwenda
she
did
not
want
to
tell
i
do
think
said
mary
gravely
that
gwenda
ever
will
come
back
again
at
least
not
if
she
can
help
it
i
thought
you
knew
that
i
suppose
i
must
have
known
he
left
it
there
mary
took
up
her
knitting
she
was
making
a
little
vest
for
baby
rowcliffe
watched
it
growing
under
her
hands
as
i
ca
knit
do
you
mind
my
smoking
she
did
if
more
women
knitted
he
said
it
would
be
a
good
thing
they
would
be
bothered
so
much
with
nerves
i
do
do
it
for
nerves
i
have
any
said
mary
he
laughed
no
i
do
think
you
have
she
fell
into
one
of
her
gentle
silences
a
silence
not
of
her
own
brooding
he
judged
it
had
no
dreams
behind
it
and
no
imagination
that
carried
her
away
a
silence
rather
that
brought
her
nearer
to
him
that
waited
on
his
mood
his
eyes
watched
under
lids
the
movements
of
her
hands
and
the
pretty
droop
of
her
head
and
he
said
to
himself
how
sweet
she
is
and
how
innocent
and
good
their
chairs
were
set
near
together
in
the
small
plot
of
grass
the
little
trees
of
the
orchard
shut
them
in
he
began
to
notice
things
about
her
that
he
had
not
noticed
before
the
shape
and
color
of
her
finger
nails
the
modeling
of
her
supple
wrists
the
way
her
ears
were
curved
and
laid
close
to
her
rather
broad
head
he
saw
that
her
skin
was
at
the
throat
and
at
her
ears
and
the
white
of
an
elder
flower
at
the
roots
of
her
red
hair
and
as
she
unwound
her
ball
of
wool
it
rolled
out
of
her
lap
and
fell
between
her
feet
she
stooped
suddenly
bringing
under
rowcliffe
eyes
the
nape
of
her
neck
shining
with
golden
down
and
her
shoulders
and
rosy
under
the
thin
muslin
of
her
blouse
they
dived
at
the
same
moment
and
as
their
heads
came
up
again
their
faces
would
have
touched
but
that
rowcliffe
suddenly
drew
back
his
own
i
say
i
beg
your
pardon
it
was
odd
but
in
the
moment
of
his
recoil
from
that
imminent
contact
rowcliffe
remembered
the
little
nurse
not
that
there
was
much
resemblance
for
though
the
little
nurse
was
sweet
she
was
not
altogether
innocent
neither
was
she
what
good
people
like
mary
cartaret
would
call
good
and
mary
leaning
back
in
her
chair
with
the
recovered
ball
in
her
lap
was
smiling
at
his
confusion
with
an
innocence
and
goodness
of
which
he
could
have
no
doubt
when
he
tried
to
account
to
himself
for
the
remembrance
he
supposed
it
must
have
been
the
red
hair
that
did
it
and
up
to
the
end
and
to
the
end
of
the
end
rowcliffe
never
knew
that
though
he
had
been
made
subject
to
a
sequence
of
relentless
inhibitions
and
of
suggestions
overpowering
in
their
nature
and
persistently
sustained
it
was
ultimately
by
aid
of
that
one
incongruous
and
irresistible
association
that
mary
cartaret
had
cast
her
spell
he
had
never
really
come
under
it
until
that
moment
july
passed
it
was
the
end
of
august
to
the
west
karva
and
morfe
high
moor
were
purple
to
the
east
the
bare
hillsides
with
their
limestone
ramparts
smouldered
in
mist
and
sun
or
shimmered
burning
like
any
hillside
of
the
south
the
light
even
soaked
into
the
gray
walls
of
garth
in
its
pastures
the
little
in
the
vicarage
orchard
might
have
been
olive
trees
twinkling
in
the
sun
mary
was
in
the
vicar
bedroom
looking
now
at
the
door
and
now
at
her
own
image
in
the
wardrobe
glass
it
was
seven
in
the
evening
and
she
had
chosen
a
perilous
moment
for
the
glass
she
wore
a
childlike
frock
of
rough
green
silk
it
had
no
collar
but
was
cut
square
at
the
neck
showing
her
white
throat
the
square
was
bordered
with
an
embroidered
design
of
peacock
eyes
the
parted
waves
of
her
red
hair
were
burnished
with
hard
brushing
its
coils
lay
close
and
smooth
as
a
thick
round
cap
it
needed
neither
comb
nor
any
ornament
mary
had
dressed
for
rowcliffe
was
coming
to
dinner
such
a
thing
had
never
been
heard
of
at
the
vicarage
but
it
had
come
to
pass
and
as
mary
thought
of
how
she
had
accomplished
it
she
wondered
what
alice
could
possibly
have
meant
when
she
said
to
her
there
are
moments
when
i
hate
you
as
she
hooked
her
up
the
back
for
it
never
could
have
happened
if
she
had
not
persuaded
the
vicar
and
herself
as
well
that
she
was
asking
rowcliffe
on
account
the
vicar
had
come
gradually
to
see
that
if
alice
must
be
married
she
had
better
marry
rowcliffe
and
have
done
with
it
he
had
got
used
to
rowcliffe
and
he
rather
liked
him
so
he
had
only
held
out
against
the
idea
for
a
fortnight
or
so
he
had
even
found
a
certain
austere
satisfaction
in
the
thought
that
he
the
doctor
who
had
tried
to
terrify
him
about
ally
insanity
having
thrown
that
bomb
into
the
peaceful
vicarage
should
be
blown
up
as
it
were
with
his
own
explosion
the
vicar
never
doubted
that
it
was
ally
that
rowcliffe
wanted
for
the
idea
of
his
wanting
gwenda
was
so
unpleasant
to
him
that
he
had
dismissed
it
as
preposterous
as
for
mary
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
mary
would
never
dream
of
marrying
and
leaving
him
and
that
if
she
did
he
would
put
his
foot
down
there
had
been
changes
in
the
vicarage
in
the
last
two
months
the
shabby
gray
and
amber
was
not
all
shabbiness
and
not
all
gray
and
amber
now
there
were
new
cretonne
covers
on
the
chairs
and
sofa
and
pure
white
muslin
curtains
at
the
windows
and
the
lamp
had
a
new
frilled
petticoat
every
afternoon
gale
was
arrayed
in
a
tight
black
gown
and
irreproachable
cap
and
apron
all
day
long
mary
and
gale
had
worked
like
galley
slaves
over
the
preparations
for
dinner
and
between
them
they
had
achieved
perfection
what
was
more
they
had
produced
an
effect
of
achieving
it
every
day
clear
soup
mayonnaise
salad
and
cheese
straws
and
all
and
the
black
coffee
made
by
mary
and
served
in
the
orchard
afterward
was
perfection
too
and
the
impression
made
on
rowcliffe
by
the
vicarage
was
that
of
a
house
and
a
household
rehabilitated
after
a
long
period
of
devastation
by
the
untiring
selfless
labor
of
a
woman
who
was
good
and
sweet
after
they
had
drunk
mary
coffee
the
vicar
strolled
away
to
his
study
so
as
to
leave
rowcliffe
alone
with
mary
and
alice
strolled
away
heaven
knew
where
so
as
to
leave
mary
alone
with
rowcliffe
and
the
vicar
said
to
himself
mary
is
really
doing
it
very
well
ally
ought
to
be
grateful
to
her
but
ally
was
a
bit
grateful
she
said
to
herself
i
half
a
mind
to
tell
him
only
gwenda
would
hate
me
and
she
called
over
her
shoulder
as
she
strolled
away
you
better
not
stay
out
too
long
you
two
it
going
to
rain
morfe
high
moor
hangs
over
garth
and
a
hot
and
swollen
cloud
was
hanging
over
morfe
high
moor
above
the
gray
ramparts
the
very
east
was
sultry
in
the
orchard
under
the
low
it
was
as
airless
as
in
a
tent
rowcliffe
did
want
to
stay
out
too
long
in
the
orchard
he
knew
that
the
window
of
the
vicar
study
raked
it
so
he
asked
mary
if
she
would
come
with
him
for
a
stroll
his
only
criticism
of
mary
was
that
she
did
walk
enough
mary
thought
my
nice
frock
will
be
ruined
if
the
rain
comes
but
she
went
shall
it
be
the
moor
or
the
fields
he
said
mary
thought
again
and
said
the
fields
he
was
glad
she
had
said
the
moor
they
strolled
past
the
village
and
turned
into
the
pasture
that
lay
between
the
high
road
and
the
beck
the
narrow
paths
led
up
a
slope
from
field
to
field
through
the
gaps
in
the
stone
walls
the
fields
turned
with
the
turning
of
the
dale
and
with
that
turning
of
the
road
that
rowcliffe
knew
under
karva
instinctively
with
a
hand
on
her
arm
he
steered
her
away
from
the
high
road
and
its
turning
toward
the
beck
so
that
they
had
their
backs
to
the
thunder
storm
as
it
came
up
over
karva
and
the
high
moor
it
was
when
they
were
down
in
the
bottom
that
it
burst
there
was
shelter
on
the
further
side
of
the
last
field
they
ran
to
it
climbed
and
crouched
together
under
the
stone
wall
rowcliffe
took
off
the
light
overcoat
he
wore
and
tried
to
put
it
on
her
but
mary
would
let
him
she
looked
at
his
clothes
at
the
round
dinner
jacket
with
its
silk
collar
and
at
the
beautiful
evening
trousers
with
their
braided
seams
he
insisted
she
refused
he
insisted
still
and
compromised
by
laying
the
overcoat
round
both
of
them
and
they
crouched
together
under
the
wall
sitting
closer
so
that
the
coat
might
cover
them
it
thundered
and
lightened
the
rain
pelted
them
from
the
high
batteries
of
karva
and
rowcliffe
drew
mary
closer
she
laughed
like
a
happy
child
rowcliffe
sighed
it
was
after
he
had
sighed
that
he
kissed
her
under
the
cover
of
the
coat
they
sat
there
for
half
an
hour
till
the
storm
ceased
with
the
rising
of
the
moon
i
afraid
the
pretty
frock
spoiled
he
said
that
does
matter
your
poor
suit
ruined
he
laughed
whatever
been
ruined
he
said
it
was
worth
it
hand
in
hand
they
went
back
together
through
the
drenched
fields
at
the
first
gap
he
stopped
it
settled
he
said
you
wo
go
back
on
it
you
care
for
me
and
you
marry
me
yes
soon
yes
soon
at
the
last
gap
he
stopped
again
mary
he
said
i
suppose
you
knew
about
gwenda
i
knew
there
was
something
what
was
it
he
had
said
to
himself
i
shall
have
to
tell
her
i
shall
have
to
say
i
cared
for
her
what
he
did
say
was
there
was
nothing
in
it
it
all
over
it
was
all
over
long
ago
i
knew
she
said
it
was
all
over
and
the
solemn
white
moon
came
up
the
moon
that
gwenda
loved
it
came
up
over
greffington
edge
and
looked
at
them
xlv
it
was
sunday
afternoon
the
last
sunday
of
august
the
first
since
that
evening
it
was
a
thursday
when
steven
rowcliffe
had
dined
at
the
vicarage
mary
had
announced
her
engagement
the
next
day
the
news
had
an
extraordinary
effect
on
alice
and
the
vicar
mary
had
come
to
her
father
in
his
study
on
friday
evening
after
prayers
she
informed
him
of
the
bare
fact
in
the
curtest
manner
without
preface
or
apology
or
explanation
a
terrible
scene
had
followed
at
least
the
vicar
part
in
it
had
been
terrible
nothing
he
had
ever
said
to
gwenda
could
compare
with
what
he
then
said
to
mary
alice
behavior
he
had
been
prepared
for
he
had
expected
anything
from
gwenda
but
from
mary
he
had
not
expected
this
it
was
her
treachery
he
resented
the
treachery
of
a
creature
he
had
depended
on
and
trusted
he
absolutely
forbade
the
engagement
he
said
it
was
unheard
of
he
spoke
of
her
conduct
as
if
it
had
been
disgraceful
or
improper
he
declared
that
that
fellow
rowcliffe
should
never
come
inside
his
house
again
he
bullied
and
threatened
and
bullied
again
and
through
it
all
mary
sat
calm
and
quiet
and
submissive
the
expression
of
the
qualities
he
had
relied
on
her
sweetness
and
goodness
never
left
her
face
she
replied
to
his
violence
yes
papa
very
well
papa
i
see
but
as
gwenda
had
warned
him
bully
as
he
would
mary
beat
him
in
the
end
she
looked
meekly
down
at
the
and
said
i
know
how
you
feel
about
it
papa
dear
i
understand
all
you
got
to
say
and
sorry
but
it
is
any
good
you
know
it
is
just
as
well
as
i
do
it
might
have
been
gwenda
who
spoke
to
him
only
that
gwenda
could
never
have
looked
meek
the
vicar
had
not
recovered
from
the
shock
he
was
convinced
that
he
never
would
recover
from
it
but
on
that
sunday
he
had
found
a
temporary
oblivion
dozing
in
his
study
between
two
services
there
had
been
no
scene
like
that
with
alice
but
what
had
passed
between
the
sisters
had
been
even
worse
mary
had
gone
straight
from
the
study
to
ally
room
ally
was
undressing
ally
received
the
news
in
a
cruel
silence
she
looked
coldly
sternly
almost
and
steadily
at
mary
you
need
have
told
me
that
she
said
at
last
i
could
see
what
you
were
doing
the
other
night
what
was
doing
yes
you
i
do
imagine
steven
rowcliffe
did
it
really
ally
what
do
you
suppose
i
did
i
do
know
what
it
was
but
i
know
you
did
something
and
i
know
that
whatever
it
was
would
have
done
it
and
mary
answered
quietly
if
i
were
you
ally
i
would
show
my
feelings
quite
so
plainly
and
ally
looked
at
her
again
it
not
feelings
she
said
mary
reddened
i
do
know
what
you
mean
you
know
some
day
ally
said
and
turned
her
back
on
her
mary
went
out
closing
the
door
softly
as
if
she
spared
her
sick
sister
unreasonably
irritated
nerves
she
felt
rather
miserable
as
she
undressed
alone
in
her
bedroom
she
was
wounded
in
her
sweetness
and
her
goodness
and
she
was
also
a
little
afraid
of
what
ally
might
take
it
into
her
head
to
say
or
do
she
did
try
to
think
what
ally
had
meant
her
sweetness
and
goodness
with
their
instinct
of
told
her
that
it
might
be
better
not
the
august
night
was
warm
and
tender
and
when
mary
had
got
into
bed
and
lay
stretched
out
in
contentment
under
the
white
sheet
she
began
to
think
of
rowcliffe
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
interests
and
presently
between
a
dream
and
a
dream
she
fell
asleep
but
ally
could
not
sleep
she
lay
till
dawn
thinking
and
thinking
and
turning
from
side
to
side
between
her
thoughts
they
were
not
concerned
with
gwenda
or
with
rowcliffe
after
her
little
spurt
of
indignation
she
had
ceased
to
think
about
gwenda
or
rowcliffe
either
mary
news
had
made
her
think
about
herself
and
her
thoughts
were
miserable
ally
was
so
far
like
her
father
the
vicar
that
the
idea
of
mary
marrying
was
intolerable
to
her
and
for
precisely
the
same
reason
because
she
saw
no
prospect
of
marrying
herself
her
father
had
begun
by
forbidding
engagement
but
he
would
end
by
sanctioning
it
he
would
never
sanction
marriage
to
jim
greatorex
even
if
she
defied
her
father
and
married
jim
greatorex
in
spite
of
him
there
would
be
almost
as
much
shame
in
it
as
if
like
essy
she
had
never
married
him
at
all
and
she
could
live
without
him
ally
had
suffered
profoundly
from
the
shock
that
had
struck
her
down
under
the
arcades
on
the
road
to
upthorne
it
had
left
her
more
than
ever
helpless
more
than
ever
subject
to
infatuation
more
than
ever
morally
inert
ally
social
self
had
grown
rigid
in
the
traditions
of
her
class
and
she
was
still
aware
of
the
unsuitability
of
her
intimacy
with
jim
greatorex
but
disaster
had
numbed
her
once
poignant
sense
of
it
she
had
yielded
to
his
fascination
partly
through
weakness
partly
in
defiance
partly
in
the
sheer
healthy
of
her
suffering
will
and
her
frustrated
senses
but
she
had
not
will
enough
to
defy
her
father
she
credited
him
with
an
infinite
capacity
to
crush
and
wound
and
for
a
day
and
a
half
the
sight
of
mary
happiness
a
spectacle
which
mary
did
not
spare
her
made
ally
restless
under
the
incessant
sting
of
it
her
longing
for
greatorex
became
insupportable
on
sunday
the
vicar
was
still
too
deeply
afflicted
by
the
same
circumstance
to
notice
ally
movements
and
ally
took
advantage
of
his
apathy
to
excuse
herself
from
sunday
school
that
afternoon
and
about
three
she
was
at
upthorne
farm
she
and
greatorex
had
found
a
moment
after
morning
service
to
arrange
the
hour
and
now
they
were
standing
together
in
the
doorway
of
the
farmhouse
in
the
house
behind
them
in
the
mistal
and
the
orchard
in
the
long
marshes
of
the
uplands
and
on
the
brooding
hills
there
was
stillness
and
solitude
maggie
had
gone
up
to
her
aunt
at
bar
hill
the
farm
servants
were
scattered
in
their
villages
alice
had
just
told
greatorex
of

the
opposition

his
voice
pleaded
and
persuaded
in
spite
of
its
accent
ally
loved
his
voice
it
sounded
musical
and
mournful
like
the
voices
of
the
mountain
sheep
coming
from
far
across
the
moor
and
purified
by
distance
he
took
her
through
the
kitchen
and
the
little
parlor
at
the
end
of
the
house
as
he
looked
round
it
trying
to
see
it
with
her
eyes
doubt
came
to
him
but
ally
standing
there
looked
toward
the
kitchen
will
maggie

she
said
ay

horror
of

that
held

his
senses
swam
he
grasped
her
as
if
he
would
have
lifted
her
bodily
from
the
floor
she
was
light
in
his
arms
as
a
child
he
had
turned
her
from

window
he
looked
fiercely
round
the
room
that
shut
them
in
his
eyes
lowered
they
fixed
themselves
on
the
bed
with
its
white
counterpane
they
saw
under
the
white
counterpane
the
dead
body
of
his
father
stretched
there
and
the
stain
on
the
grim
beard
tilted
to
the
ceiling

with

hand
on

shoulder
and
made
her
go
before
him
down
the
stairs
he
went
back
into
the
room
to
pick
up
her
hat
he
found
her
waiting
for
him
looking
back
at
the
turn
of
the
stair
where
john
greatorex
coffin
had
stuck
in
the
corner
of

a
narrow

from

the

ruined

purple

utterly

uncaught

slowly
up

neither

going

quivering
air
was
like
a
sheet
of
glass
let
down
between
plain
and
hill
slowly
with
mournful
cries
a
flock
of
mountain
sheep
came
down

solitary
figure
topped

sat
there
on

floor
of

silent
in
the
attitude
of
children
who
crouch
hiding
in
their
play

strewn
for

soft

on

his
hands
clutching
his

and
in
his
thick
mournful
voice
he
spoke

he
was
lying
flat
on
his
back
now
with
his
arms
stretched
out
above
his

stared
up
at
the
rafters
as
he
went

that
brought
her
to
his
side
with
her
soft
cry
for
a
moment
he
lay
rigid
and
still
then
he
turned
and
put
his
arm
round
her
the
light
streamed
on
them
where
they
lay
through
the
open
doorway
of
the
loft
they
heard
the
cry
of
the
sheep
coming
down
into
the
pasture
greatorex
got
up
and
slid
the
door
softly
to
xlvi
morfe
fair
was
over
and
the
farmers
were
going
home
a
broken
straggling
traffic
was
on
the
roads
from
dale
to
dale
there
were
men
who
went
gaily
in
spring
carts
and
in
wagons
there
were
men
on
horseback
and
on
foot
who
drove
their
sheep
and
their
cattle
before
them
a
train
of
three
were
going
slowly
up
garthdale
with
much
lingering
to
gather
together
and
rally
the
weary
and
bewildered
flocks
into
this
train
there
burst
rocking
at
full
gallop
a
trap
drawn
by
greatorex
terrified
and
indignant
mare
daisy
was
not
driven
by
greatorex
for
the
reins
were
slack
in
his
dropped
hands
she
was
urged
whipped
up
and
maddened
to
her
relentless
speed
her
open
nostrils
drank
the
wind
of
her
going
greatorex
face
flamed
and
his
eyes
were
brilliant
they
declared
a
furious
ecstasy
ever
and
again
he
rose
and
struggled
to
stand
upright
and
recover
his
grip
of
the
reins
ever
and
again
he
was
pitched
backward
on
to
the
seat
where
he
swayed
perilously
with
the
swaying
of
the
trap
behind
him
in
the
bottom
of
the
trap
two
young
calves
netted
in
pushed
up
their
melancholy
eyes
and
innocent
noses
through
the
mesh
hurled
against
each
other
flung
rhythmically
from
side
to
side
they
shared
the
blind
trouble
of
the
man
and
the
torment
of
the
mare
for
the
first
two
miles
out
of
morfe
the
trap
charged
scattering
men
and
beasts
before
it
and
taking
the
curves
of
the
road
at
a
tangent
with
the
third
mile
the
pace
slackened
the
mare
had
slaked
her
thirst
for
the
wind
of
her
going
and
greatorex
fury
was
appeased
at
the
risk
of
pitching
forward
over
the
step
he
succeeded
in
gathering
up
the
reins
as
they
neared
the
dangerous
descent
to
garthdale
he
had
now
dropped
from
the
violence
of
his
ecstasy
into
a
state
in
which
he
was
borne
swaying
on
a
vague
interminable
road
that
overhung
giddily
the
bottomless
pit
and
was
flanked
by
hills
that
loomed
and
reeled
that
oppressed
him
with
their
horrible
immensity
he
passed
the
bridge
the
church
the
vicarage
the
schoolhouse
with
its
beckoning
tree
and
by
the
mercy
of
heaven
he
was
unaware
of
them
at
the
turn
of
the
road
on
upthorne
hill
the
mare
utterly
sobered
by
the
gradient
bowed
her
head
and
went
with
slow
wise
feet
taking
care
of
the
trap
and
of
her
master
as
for
greatorex
he
had
ceased
to
struggle
and
at
the
door
of
his
house
his
servant
maggie
received
him
in
her
arms
he
stayed
in
bed
the
whole
of
the
next
day
bearing
his
sickness
while
maggie
waited
on
him
and
in
the
evening
when
he
lay
under
her
hand
weak
but
she
delivered
herself
of
what
was
in

jim
greatorex
with
that
she
left
him
for
the
next
three
months
greatorex
was
more
than
ever
uneasy
in
his
soul
the
sunday
after
maggie
outburst
he
had
sat
all
morning
and
afternoon
in
his
parlor
with
his
father
bible
he
had
not
even
tried
to
see
alice
cartaret
for
three
months
off
and
on
in
the
intervals
of
seeing
alice
he
longed
with
an
intense
and
painful
longing
for
his
god
he
longed
for
him
just
because
he
felt
that
he
was
utterly
separated
from
him
by
his
sin
he
wanted
the
thing
he
could
have
and
was
fit
to
have
he
wanted
it
just
as
he
wanted
alice
cartaret
and
by
his
sin
he
did
not
mean
his
getting
drunk
greatorex
did
not
think
of
god
as
likely
to
take
his
getting
drunk
very
seriously
any
more
than
he
had
seemed
to
take
maggie
and
essy
seriously
for
greatorex
measured
god
reprobation
by
his
own
repentance
his
real
offense
against
god
was
his
offense
against
alice
cartaret
he
had
got
drunk
in
order
to
forget
it
but
that
resource
would
henceforth
be
denied
him
he
was
not
going
to
get
drunk
any
more
because
he
knew
that
if
he
did
alice
cartaret
would
marry
him
meanwhile
he
nourished
his
soul
on
its
own
longing
on
the
psalms
of
david
and
on
the
book
of
job
greatorex
would
have
made
a
happy
saint
but
he
was
a
most
lugubrious
sinner
xlvii
the
train
from
durlingham
rolled
slowly
into
reyburn
station
gwenda
cartaret
leaned
from
the
window
of
a
third
class
carriage
and
looked
up
and
down
the
platform
she
got
out
handing
her
to
a
friendly
porter
nobody
had
come
to
meet
her
they
were
much
too
busy
up
at
the
vicarage
from
the
next
compartment
there
alighted
a
group
of
six
persons
a
lady
in
widow
weeds
an
elderly
lady
and
gentleman
who
addressed
her
affectionately
as
fanny
dear
and
obviously
belonging
to
the
pair
a
very
young
man
and
a
still
younger
woman
there
was
also
a
much
older
man
closely
attached
to
them
but
not
quite
so
obviously
related
these
six
people
also
looked
up
and
down
the
platform
expecting
to
be
met
they
were
interested
in
gwenda
cartaret
they
gazed
at
her
as
they
had
already
glanced
surreptitiously
and
kindly
on
the
platform
at
durlingham
now
they
seemed
to
be
saying
to
themselves
that
they
were
sure
it
must
be
she
gwenda
walked
quickly
away
from
them
and
disappeared
through
the
into
the
station
yard
and
then
rowcliffe
who
had
apparently
been
hiding
in
the
general
came
out
on
to
the
platform
the
six
fell
upon
him
with
cries
of
joy
and
affection
they
were
his
mother
his
paternal
uncle
and
aunt
his
two
youngest
cousins
and
harker
his
best
friend
and
colleague
who
had
taken
his
place
in
january
when
he
had
been
ill
they
had
all
come
down
from
leeds
for
rowcliffe
wedding
rowcliffe
trap
and
peacock
from
garthdale
stood
side
by
side
in
the
gwenda
in
peacock
trap
had
left
the
town
before
she
heard
behind
her
the
clanking
hoofs
of
rowcliffe
little
brown
horse
she
thought
he
will
pass
in
another
minute
i
shall
see
him
but
she
did
not
see
him
all
the
way
up
rathdale
to
morfe
the
sound
of
the
wheels
and
of
the
clanking
hoofs
pursued
her
and
rowcliffe
still
hung
back
he
did
not
want
to
pass
her
well
said
peacock
thot
beats
mae
i
sud
navver

thot

maare
could
a
got

from
t

horse
nat
ef
e
a
mind
t
paass
no
said
gwenda
she
was
thinking
it
mary
it
mary
how
could
she
when
she
when
she
was
on
her
honor
not
to
think
of
him
and
she
remembered
a
conversation
she
had
had
with
her
stepmother
two
months
ago
when
the
news
came
robina
had
seized
the
situation
at
a
glance
and
she
had
probed
it
to
its
core
you
wanted
him
to
marry
ally
did
you
it
was
much
good
going
away
if
you
left
him
with
mary
but
she
had
said
mary
knew
and
robina
had
answered
marvelously
you
should
never
have
let
her
it
was
her
knowing
that
did
it
you
were
three
women
to
one
man
and
mary
was
the
one
without
a
scruple
do
you
suppose
she
think
of
ally
or
of
you
either
and
she
had
tried
to
be
loyal
to
mary
and
to
rowcliffe
she
had
said
if
we
three
we
all
had
our
innings
and
he
made
his
choice
and
robina
it
was
mary
did
the
choosing
she
had
added
that
gwenda
was
a
little
fool
and
that
she
ought
to
have
known
that
though
mary
was
as
meek
as
moses
she
was
that
sort
she
went
on
thinking
to
the
steady
clanking
of
the
hoofs
i
suppose
she
said
to
herself
she
could
help
it
the
lights
of
morfe
shone
through
the
november
darkness
the
little
slow
mare
crawled
up
the
winding
hill
to
the
top
of
the
green
rowcliffe
horse
was
slower
but
no
sooner
had
peacock
trap
passed
the
doctor
house
on
its
way
out
of
the
village
square
than
the
clanking
hoofs
went
fast
rowcliffe
was
free
to
go
his
own
pace
now
which
of
you
two
is
going
to
hook
me
up
said
mary
she
was
in
the
vicar
room
putting
on
her
before
the
wardrobe
glass
her
two
sisters
were
dressing
her
i
will
said
gwenda
you
better
let
me
said
alice
i
know
where
the
eyes
are
gwenda
lifted
up
the
and
held
it
ready
and
while
alice
pulled
and
fumbled
mary
gazed
at
her
own
reflection
and
at
alice
you
should
have
done
as
mummy
said
and
had
your
frock
made
in
london
like
gwenda
they
have
given
you
a
decent
cut
you
look
as
if
you
could
breathe
my
frock
all
right
said
alice
her
fingers
trembled
as
she
strained
at
the
hooks
and
eyes
and
in
the
end
it
was
gwenda
who
hooked
mary
up
while
alice
held
the
veil
she
held
it
in
front
of
her
the
long
streaming
net
shivered
with
the
trembling
of
her
hands
the
wedding
was
at
two
the
church
was
crowded
so
were
the
churchyard
and
the
road
beside
the
vicarage
and
the
bridge
over
the
beck
morfe
and
greffington
had
emptied
themselves
into
garthdale
greffington
had
lent
its
organist
it
was
only
when
it
was
all
over
that
somebody
noticed
that
jim
greatorex
was
not
there
with
the
village
choir
celebrating
a
bit
too
early
somebody
said
and
it
was
only
when
it
was
all
over
that
rowcliffe
found
gwenda
he
found
her
in
the
long
flat
pause
the
of
profoundest
realisation
that
comes
when
the
bride
disappears
to
put
off
her
for
the
gown
she
will
go
away
in
she
had
come
out
to
the
gathered
at
the
door
to
tell
them
that
the
bride
would
soon
be
ready
rowcliffe
and
harker
were
standing
apart
at
the
end
of
the
path
by
the
door
that
led
from
the
garden
to
the
orchard
he
came
toward
her
harker
drew
back
into
the
orchard
they
followed
him
and
found
themselves
alone
for
ten
minutes
they
paced
the
narrow
flagged
path
under
the
orchard
wall
and
they
talked
quickly
like
two
who
have
but
a
short
time
well
so

back
at
last
at
last

she
stared
at
him
for
a
second
and
then
looked
away

of
it

they
turned

gwenda

so
oh

the
candles

burn
it
is
such
awfully
hard
work
you
know
what
is
what
i
doing
he
stopped
straight
in
the
narrow
path
and
looked
at
her
i
say
what
you
doing
she
told
him
his
face
expressed
surprise
and
resentment
and
a
curious
wonder
and
bewilderment
but
i
thought
i
thought
they
told
me
you
were
having
no
end
of
a
time
tunbridge
wells

very
amusing

he
stopped
dead
and
stared
at
her
but
they
told
me
i

thought
you
were
in
london
with
cartaret
all
the
time
she
laughed
did
papa
tell
you
that
no
i
do
know
who
told
me
i
i
got
the
impression
he
almost
stammered
i
must
have
misunderstood
she
meditated
it
sounds
awfully
like
papa
he
simply
ca
believe
poor
thing
that
i
stick
to
anything
so
respectable
hah
he
laughed
out
his
contempt
for
the
vicar
he
had
forgotten
that
he
too
had
wondered
chuck
it
gwenda
he
said
chuck
it
i
ca
she
said
not
yet
it
too
lucrative
but
if
it
makes
you
seedy
it
does
it
wo
it
is
hard
work
only
she
broke
off
it
time
for
you
to
go
steve
steve
rowcliffe
youngest
cousin
was
calling
from
the
study
window
come
along
mary
ready
all
right
he
shouted
i
coming
but
he
stood
still
there
at
the
end
of
the
orchard
under
the
gray
wall
steven
gwenda
put
out
her
hand
he
held
her
with
his
troubled
eyes
he
did
not
see
her
hand
he
saw
her
eyes
only
that
troubled
his
i
say
is
it
very
beastly
no
not
a
bit
you
must
go
steven
you
must
go
if
i
only

he
persisted
they
were
going
down
the
path
now
toward
the
house
i
would
have
let
you
you
could
have
stopped
me
it
was
what
she
had
always
said
to
all
of
them
she
smiled
you
did
stop
me
going
you
know
if
you
only
told
me
she
smiled
again
a
smile
as
of
infinite
wisdom
dear
steven
there
was
nothing
to
tell
they
had
come
to
the
door
in
the
wall
it
led
into
the
garden
he
opened
to
let
her
pass
through
the
was
gathered
together
on
the
flagged
path
before
the
house
it
greeted
them
with
laughter
and
cries
cheerfully
ironic
the
bride
in
her
traveling
dress
stood
on
the
threshold
outside
the
carriage
waited
at
the
open
gate
rowcliffe
took
mary
hand
in
his
and
they
ran
down
the
path
he
can
sprint
fast
enough
now
said
rowcliffe
uncle
but
his
youngest
cousin
and
harker
his
best
friend
had
gone
faster
they
were
waiting
together
on
the
bridge
and
the
girl
had
a
slipper
in
her
hand
were
you
ever
she
said
at
such
an
awful
wedding
harker
saw
nothing
wrong
about
the
wedding
but
he
admitted
that
his
experience
was
small
the
youngest
cousin
was
not
appeased
by
his
confession
she
went
on
why
on
earth
did
steven
to
marry
gwenda
not
much
good
trying
said
the
doctor
if
she
would
have
him
you
believe
that
silly
story
i
do
did
you
see
her
face
harker
admitted
that
he
had
seen
her
face
and
then
as
the
carriage
passed
rowcliffe
youngest
cousin
did
an
odd
thing
she
tossed
the
slipper
over
the
bridge
into
the
beck
harker
had
not
time
to
comment
on
her
action
they
were
coming
for
him
from
the
house
rowcliffe
youngest
had
fainted
away
on
the
top
landing
everybody
remembered
then
that
it
was
she
who
had
been
in
love
with
him
xlviii
alice
had
sent
for
gwenda
three
months
had
gone
by
since
her
sister
wedding
and
all
her
fears
were
gathered
together
in
the
fear
of
her
father
and
of
what
was
about
to
happen
to
her
and
before
gwenda
could
come
to
her
rowcliffe
and
mary
had
come
to
the
vicar
in
his
study
they
had
been
a
long
time
with
him
and
then
rowcliffe
had
gone

they
had
her
before

there
it
was
early
in
a
dull
evening
in
february
the
lamps
were
lit
and
in
their
yellow
light
ally
face
showed
a
pale
and
quivering
exaltation
it
was
the
face
of
a
hunted
and
terrified
thing
that
has
gathered
courage
in
desperation
to
turn
and
stand
she
defended
herself
with
sullen
defiance
and
denial
it
had
come
to
that
for
ned
the
shepherd
at
upthorne
had
told
what
he
had
seen

at

as
a
sign
to
her
not
to
mind
what
alice
said

the
words
were
almost
inaudible
in
the
shuddering
groan
he
advanced
on
her
to
turn
her
from
the
room
ally
sank
on
her
sofa
as
she
saw
him
come
rowcliffe
stepped
between
them
for
god
sake
sir
ally
was
struggling
in
hysterics
now
choking
between
her
piteous
and
savage
cries
rowcliffe
laid
her
on
the
sofa
and
put
a
cushion
under
her
head
when
he
tried
to
loosen
her
gown
at
her
throat
she
screamed
it
all
right
ally
it
all
right
it
it
the
vicar
hissed
at
him
it
wo
be
unless

leave
her
to
me
if
you
go
on
bullying
her
much
longer
i
wo

for
the
consequences

surely
want
it
all
right
ally
lie
quiet
there
like
that
that
a
good
girl
nobody
going
to
worry
you
any
more
he
was
kneeling
by
the
sofa
pressing
his
hand
to
her
forehead
ally
still
sobbed
convulsively
but
she
lay
quiet
she
closed
her
eyes
under
rowcliffe
soothing
hand
you
might
go
and
see
if
you
can
find
some
salvolatile
mary
he
said
mary
went
the
vicar
who
had
turned
his
back
on
this
scene
went
also
into
his
study
ally
still
kept
her
eyes
shut
has
mary
gone
yes
and
papa
yes
lie
still
she
lay
still
there
was
the
sound
of
wheels
on
the
road
it
brought
mary
and
the
vicar
back
into
the
room
the
wheels
stopped
the
gate
clanged
rowcliffe
rose
that
greatorex
i
go
to
him
ally
lay
very
still
now
still
as
a
corpse
with
closed
eyes
the
house
door
opened
rowcliffe
drew
back
into
the
room
it
is
greatorex
he
said
it
gwenda
who
sent
for
her
said
the
vicar
i
did
said
ally
she
had
opened
her
eyes
thank
god
for
that
anyhow
said
rowcliffe
mary
and
her
father
looked
at
each
other
neither
of
them
seemed
to
want
to
go
out
to
gwenda
it
struck
rowcliffe
that
the
vicar
was
afraid
they
waited
while
gwenda
paid
her
driver
and
dismissed
him
they
could
hear
her
speaking
out
there
in
the
passage
the
house
door
shut
and
she
came
to
them
she
paused
in
the
doorway
looking
at
the
three
who
stood
facing
her
embarrassed
and
expectant
she
seemed
to
be
thinking
that
it
was
odd
that
they
should
stand
there
the
door
thrown
back
hid
alice
who
lay
behind
it
on
her
sofa
come
in
gwenda
said
the
vicar
with
exaggerated
suavity
she
came
in
and
closed
the
door
then
she
saw
alice
she
took
the
hand
that
rowcliffe
held
out
to
her
without
looking
at
him
she
was
looking
at
alice
alice
gave
a
low
cry
and
struggled
to
her
feet
i
thought
you
were
never
coming
she
said
gwenda
held
her
in
her
arms
she
faced
them
what
have
you
been
doing
to
her
all
of
you
rowcliffe
answered
though
he
was
the
innocent
one
of
the
three
he
looked
the
guiltiest
he
looked
utterly
ashamed
we
had
rather
a
scene
and
it
been
a
bit
too
much
for
her
he
said
so
i
see
said
gwenda
she
had
not
greeted
mary
or
her
father
if
you
could
persuade
her
to
go
upstairs
to
bed
i
told
you
i
wo
go
till
he
comes
said
ally
she
sat
down
on
the
sofa
as
a
sign
that
she
was
going
to
wait
till
who
comes
gwenda
asked
she
stared
at
the
three
with
a
fierce
amazement
and
they
were
abashed
she
does
know
steve
said
mary

gwenda
she
sat
down
beside
ally

as

she
does
deny
it
he
drove
it
home
has
she
confessed
she
told
me

true
what
you
think
in
the
silence
that
fell
on
the
four
rowcliffe
stayed
where
he
stood
downcast
and
averted
it
was
as
if
he
felt
that
gwenda
could
have
charged
him
with
betrayal
of
a
trust
the
vicar
looked
at
his
watch
he
turned
to
rowcliffe
is
that
fellow
coming
or
is
he
not
he
wo
funk

said
rowcliffe

jim
greatorex
she
said
yes
what
is
it
that
he
wo
funk
she
looked
from
one
to
the
other
nobody
answered
her
it
was
as
if
they
were
all
three
afraid
of
her
i
see
she
said
if
you
ask
me
i
think
he
much
better
not
come
my
dear
gwenda
the
vicar
was
deferent
to
the
power
that
had
dragged
ally
confession
from
her
we
get
through
with
this
the
sooner
the
better
it
what
we
all
here
for
i
know
still
i
think
you
have
to
leave
it
leave
it
yes
papa
we
ca
leave
it
said
rowcliffe
something
got
to
be
done
the
vicar
groaned
and
rowcliffe
had
pity
on
him
if
you
like
me
to
do
it
i
can
interview
him
i
wish
you
would
very
well
he
moved
uneasily
i
better
see
him
here
had
i
you
better
not
see
him
anywhere
said
gwenda
he
ca
marry
her
she
held
them
all
three
by
the
sheer
shock
of
it
the
vicar
spoke
first
what
do
you
mean
ca
he
he
must
not
ally
does
want
to
marry
him
he
asked
her
long
ago
and
she
would
have
him
do
you
mean
said
rowcliffe
surprised
out
of
his
reticence
before
this
happened
yes
and
she
would
have
him
no
she
was
afraid
of
him
she
was
afraid
of
him
and
yet
it
was
mary
who
spoke
now
yes
mary
and
yet
she
cared
for
him
the
vicar
turned
on
her
you
as
bad
as
she
is
how
can
you
bring
yourself
to
speak
of
it
if
you
a
modest
girl
you
just
told
us
that
your
shameless
are
we
to
suppose
that
you
defending
her
i
am
defending
her
there
nobody
else
to
do
it
you
all
set
on
her
and
tortured
her
not
all
gwenda
said
rowcliffe
but
she
did
not
heed
him
she
have
told
you
everything
if
you
had
frightened
her
you
have
had
an
atom
of
pity
for
her
you
never
thought
of
for
a
minute
you
been
thinking
of
yourselves
you
might
have
killed
her
and
you
did
care
the
vicar
looked
at
her
it
you
gwenda
who
do
care
about
what
she
done
you
mean
i
do
you
ought
to
be
gentle
with
her
papa
you
drove
her
to
it
rowcliffe
answered
we
not
say
what
drove
her
gwenda
she
was
driven
she
said
no
man
say
he
is
tempted
of
god
when
he
is
driven
by
his
own
lusts
and
enticed
said
the
vicar
he
had
risen
and
the
movement
brought
him
face
to
face
with
gwenda
and
as
she
looked
at
him
it
was
as
if
she
saw
vividly
and
for
the
first
time
the
profound
unspirituality
of
her
father
face
she
knew
from
what
source
his
eyes
drew
their
darkness
she
understood
the
meaning
of
the
gross
red
mouth
that
showed
itself
in
the
fierce
lifting
of
the
ascetic
grim
moustache
and
she
conceived
a
horror
of
his
fatherhood
no
man
ought
to
say
that
of
his
own
daughter
how
does
he
know
her
own
and
what
his
she
said
rowcliffe
stared
at
her
in
a
sort
of
awful
admiration
she
was
terrible
she
was
fierce
she
was
mad
but
it
was
the
fierceness
and
the
madness
of
pity
and
of
compassion
she
went
on
you
no
business
to
be
hard
on
her
you
must
have
known
i
knew
nothing
said
the
vicar
he
appealed
to
her
with
a
helpless
gesture
of
his
hands
you
did
know
you
were
warned
you
were
told
not
to
shut
her
up
and
you
did
shut
her
up
you
ca
blame
her
if
she
got
away
you
flung
her
to
jim
greatorex
there
was
anybody
who
cared
for
her
but
him
cared
for
her
he
snarled
his
disgust
yes
cared
for
her
you
think
that
horrible
of
her
that
she
should
have
gone
to
him
and
yet
you
want
to
tie
her
to
him
when
she
afraid
of
him
and
i
think
it
horrible
of
you
she
must
marry
him

again

brought
it
on
herself
gwenda

it
i
work

her
i
take
care
of
the
child
oh

the
vicar
waved
her
away
with
a
frantic
flapping
of
his
hands
he
turned
to
his
rowcliffe
i
beg
you
will
you
use
your
influence
i
have
none
that
drew
her
steven
help
me
ca
you
see
how
terrible
it
is
if
she
afraid
of
him
but
she
he
looked
at
her
with
his
miserable
eyes
then
turned
them
from
her
considering
gravely
what
she
had
said
it
was
then
while
rowcliffe
was
considering
it
that
the
garden
gate
opened
violently
and
fell
to
they
waited
for
the
sound
of
the
front
door

instead

they
heard
two
doors
open
and
ally
voice
calling
to
greatorex
in
the
hall
as
the
vicar
flung
himself
from
his
study
into
the
other
room
he
saw
alice
standing
close
to
greatorex
by
the
shut

greatorex
said
rowcliffe
ay
it
do
said
greatorex
with
a
grin
of
satisfaction
he
turned
to
alice
the
triumph
still
flaming
in
his
face
afraaid
of
mae
no
she
said
gently
not
now
yo
navver
were
said
greatorex
and
he
laughed
that
laugh
was
more
than
cartaret
could
bear
he
thrust
out
his
face
toward
greatorex
rowcliffe
watching
them
saw
that
he
trembled
and
that
the
furious
face
was
flushed
deeply
on
the
left
side
the
vicar
boomed
you
will
leave
my
house
this
instant
greatorex
and
you
will
never
come
into
it
again
but
greatorex
was
already
looking
for
his
cap
i
navver
coom
into
et
again
he
assented
placably
there
were
no
prayers
at
the
vicarage
that
night
it
was
nearly
eleven
greatorex
was
gone
gwenda
was
upstairs
helping
alice
to
undress
mary
sat
alone
in
the
crying
steadily
the
vicar
and
rowcliffe
were
in
the
study
in
all
this
terrible
business
of
alice
the
vicar
felt
that
his
had
been
a
comfort
to
him
rowcliffe
he
said
suddenly
i
feel
very
queer
i
do
wonder
sir
i
should
go
to
bed
if
i
were
you
i
shall
presently
the
flush
deepened
and
darkened
as
he
brooded
it
fascinated
rowcliffe
i
think
it
would
be
better
said
the
vicar
slowly
if
i
left
the
parish
it
the
only
solution
i
can
see
he
meant
to
the
problem
of
his
respectability
rowcliffe
said
yes
perhaps
it
would
be
better
he
was
thinking
that
it
would
solve
his
problem
too
for
he
knew
that
there
would
be
a
problem
if
gwenda
came
back
to
her
father
the
vicar
rose
heavily
and
went
to
his
desk
he
opened
it
and
began
fumbling
about
in
it
looking
for
things
he
was
doing
this
it
seemed
to
his
for
quite
a
long
time
but
it
was
only
eleven
when
mary
heard
sounds
in
the
study
that
terrified
her
of
a
chair
overturned
and
of
a
heavy
body
falling
to
the
floor
and
then
steven
called
to
her
she
found
him
kneeling
on
the
floor
beside
her
father
loosening
his
clothes
the
vicar
face
which
she
discerned
half
hidden
between
the
bending
head
of
rowcliffe
and
his
arms
was
purple
and
horribly
distorted
rowcliffe
did
not
look
at
her
he
in
a
fit
he
said
go
upstairs
and
fetch
gwenda
and
for
sake
do
let
ally
see
him
xlix
the
village
knew
all
about
jim
greatorex
and
alice
cartaret
now
where
their
names
had
been
whispered
by
two
or
three
in
the
bar
of
the
red
lion
over
the
post
office
counter
in
the
schoolhouse
in
the
smithy
and
on
the
open
road
the
loud
scandal
of
them
burst
with
horror
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
jim
greatorex
was
made
aware
that
public
opinion
was
against
him
wherever
he
showed
himself
the
men
slunk
from
him
and
the
women
stared
he
set
his
teeth
and
held
his
chin
up
and
passed
them
as
if
he
had
not
seen
them
he
was
determined
to
defy
public
opinion
standing
in
the
door
of
his
kinsman
smithy
he
defied
it
it
was
the
day
before
his
wedding
he
had
been
riding
home
from
morfe
market
and
his
mare
daisy
had
cast
a
shoe
coming
down
the
hill
he
rode
her
up
to
the
smithy
and
called
for
blenkiron
shouting
his
need
blenkiron
came
out
and
looked
at
him
sulkily
i

maare
he
said
but
yo

for

dismounted

he
had
said
and
maggie
with
a
sullen
look
and
hitching
her
coarse
apron
had
replied
remarkably

maggie

turned

from

ay
i
waait

she
said
and
maggie
had
stayed
to
bake
and
clean
rough
and
sullen
without
a
smile
she
had
waited
on
young
greatorex
but
alice
was
not
afraid
of
maggie
she
was
not
going
to
admit
for
a
moment
that
she
was
afraid
of
her
she
was
not
going
to
admit
that
she
was
afraid
of
anything
but
one
thing
that
her
father
would
die
if
he
died
she
would
have
killed
him
or
rather
she
and
greatorex
would
have
killed
him
between
them
this
statement
ally
held
to
and
reiterated
and
refused
to
qualify
for
alice
at
upthorne
had
become
a
creature
matchless
in
cunning
and
of
subtle
and
marvelous
resource
she
had
been
terrified
and
tortured
shamed
and
cowed
she
had
been
hounded
to
her
marriage
and
conveyed
with
an
appalling
suddenness
to
upthorne
that
place
of
sinister
and
terrible
suggestion
and
the
bed
in
which
john
greatorex
had
died
had
been
her
marriage
bed
her
mind
like
a
thing
pursued
and
in
deadly
peril
took
instantaneously
a
line
it
doubled
and
dodged
it
hid
itself
its
instinct
was
expert
in
disguises
in
subterfuges
and
shifts
in
her
soul
she
knew
that
she
was
done
for
if
she
once
admitted
and
gave
in
to
her
fear
of
upthorne
and
of
her
husband
house
or
if
she
were
ever
to
feel
again
her
fear
of
greatorex
which
was
the
most
intolerable
of
all
her
fears
it
was
as
if
nature
itself
were
aware
that
if
ally
were
not
dispossessed
of
that
terror
before
child
was
born
her
own
purpose
would
be
insecure
as
if
the
unborn
child
the
flesh
and
blood
of
the
greatorexes
that
had
entered
into
her
protested
against
her
disastrous
cowardice
so
without
ally
being
in
the
least
aware
of
it
ally
mind
struggling
toward
sanity
fabricated
one
enormous
fear
the
fear
of
her
father
death
a
fear
that
she
could
own
and
face
and
set
it
up
in
place
of
that
secret
and
dangerous
thing
which
was
the
fear
of
life
itself
ally
insisting
a
dozen
times
a
day
that
she
had
killed
poor
papa
was
completely
taken
in
by
this
play
of
her
surreptitiously
soul
even
rowcliffe
was
taken
in
by
it
he
called
it
a
morbid
obsession
and
he
began
to
wonder
whether
he
had
not
been
mistaken
about
ally
after
all
whether
her
nature
was
not
more
subtle
and
sensitive
than
he
had
guessed
more
intricately
and
dangerously
mixed
for
the
sadness
of
the
desolate
land
of
the
naked
hillsides
of
the
moor
marshes
with
their
ghostly
mists
the
brooding
of
the
watchful
solitary
house
the
horror
of
haunted
twilights
of
nightfall
and
of
midnights
now
and
then
when
greatorex
was
abroad
looking
after
his
cattle
and
she
lay
alone
under
the
white
ceiling
that
sagged
above
her
bed
and
heard
the
weak
wind
picking
at
the
pane
her
fear
of
maggie
and
of
what
maggie
had
been
to
greatorex
and
might
be
again
her
fear
of
the
savage
violent
and
repulsive
elements
in
the
man
who
was
her
god
her
fear
of
her
own
repulsion
the
tremor
of
her
recoiling
nerves
premonitions
of
her
alien
blood
the
vague
melancholy
of
her
secret
motherhood
they
were
all
mingled
together
and
hidden
from
her
in
the
vast
gloom
of
her
one
fear
and
once
the
dominant
terror
was
set
up
her
instinct
found
a
thousand
ways
of
strengthening
it
through
her
adoration
of
her
lover
her
mind
had
become
saturated
with
his
mournful
consciousness
of
sin
in
their
moments
of
contrition
they
were
both
convinced
that
they
would
be
punished
but
ally
had
borne
her
sin
superbly
she
had
declared
that
it
was
hers
and
hers
only
and
that
she
and
not
greatorex
would
be
punished
and
now
the
punishment
had
come
she
persuaded
herself
that
her
father
death
was
the
retribution
heaven
required
and
all
the
time
through
the
perilous
months
nature
mindful
of
her
own
tightened
her
hold
on
ally
through
ally
fear
ally
was
afraid
to
be
left
alone
with
it
therefore
she
never
let
greatorex
out
of
her
sight
if
she
could
help
it
she
followed
him
from
room
to
room
of
the
sad
house
where
he
was
painting
and
papering
and
whitewashing
to
make
it
fine
for
her
where
he
was
she
had
to
be
stowed
away
in
some
swept
corner
she
would
sit
with
her
sweet
and
sorrowful
eyes
fixed
on
him
as
he
labored
she
trotted
after
him
through
the
house
and
out
into
the
mistal
and
up
the
three
fields
she
would
crouch
on
a
heap
of
wrapped
in
a
fur
coat
and
watch
him
at
his
work
in
the
stable
and
the
in
her
need
to
immortalise
this
passion
she
could
not
have
done
better
her
utter
dependence
on
him
flattered
and
softened
the
distrustful
violent
and
headstrong
man
her
one
chance
and
ally
knew
it
was
to
cling
if
she
had
once
shamed
him
by
her
fastidious
shrinking
she
would
have
lost
him
for
as
gale
had
told
her
long
ago
you
could
do
nothing
with
jimmy
when
he
was
shamed
maggie
for
all
her
coarseness
had
contrived
to
shame
him
so
had
essy
in
her
freedom
and
her
pride
ally
clinging
so
far
from
irritating
or
obstructing
him
drew
out
the
infinite
pity
and
tenderness
he
had
for
all
sick
and
helpless
things
he
could
no
more
have
pushed
little
ally
from
him
than
he
could
have
kicked
a
mothering
ewe
or
stamped
on
a
new
dropped
lamb
he
would
call
to
her
if
she
failed
to
come
he
would
hold
out
his
big
hand
to
her
as
he
would
have
held
it
to
a
child
her
smallness
her
fineness
and
fragility
enchanted
him
the
palms
of
her
hands
had
the
smoothness
and
softness
of
silk
and
they
made
a
sound
like
silk
as
they
withdrew
themselves
with
a
lingering
stroking
touch
from
his
he
still
felt
with
a
fearful
and
admiring
wonder
the
difference
of
her
flesh
from
his
to
be
sure
jim
tenderness
was
partly
penitential
only
it
was
ally
alone
who
had
moved
him
to
a
perfect
and
unbearable
contrition
for
the
two
women
whom
he
had
loved
and
left
greatorex
had
felt
nothing
but
a
passing
pang
for
the
woman
he
had
made
his
wife
he
would
go
always
with
a
wound
in
his
soul
and
with
ally
too
the
supernatural
came
to
nature
aid
her
fear
had
a
profound
strain
of
the
uncanny
in
it
and
jim
bodily
presence
was
her
shelter
from
her
fear
and
as
it
bound
them
flesh
to
flesh
closer
and
closer
it
wedded
them
in
one
memory
one
consolation
and
one
soul
one
day
she
had
followed
him
into
the
stable
and
on
the
among
all
the
cobwebs
where
it
had
been
put
away
and
forgotten
she
found
the
little
bottle
of
chlorodyne
she
took
it
up
and
jim
scolded
her
gently
as
if
she
had
been
a
child

on
the
among

cobwebs
he
made
a
nest
for
her
of
clean
hay
where
she
sat
and
watched
him
as
he
gave
daisy
her
feed
of
corn
she
watched
every
movement
of
him
every
gesture

and
intent

and
every

rowcliffe
said
wait

before
long
and
jim
waited
he
waited
till
one
afternoon
in
february
when
they
were
again
in
the
stable
together
he
had
turned
his
back
on
her
for
a
moment
when
he
looked
round
she
was
gone
from
her
seat
on
the
cornsacks
she
was
standing
by
the
with
the
bottle
of
chlorodyne
in
her
hand
and
at
her
lips
he
thought
she
was
smelling
it
she
tilted
her
head
back
her
eyes
slewed
sidelong
toward
him
they
quivered
as
he
leaped
to
her
she
had
not
drunk
a
drop
and
he
knew
it
but
she
clutched
her
bottle
with
a
febrile
obstinacy
he
had
to
loosen
her
little
fingers
one
by
one
he
poured
the
liquid
into
the
stable
gutter
and
flung
the
bottle
on
to
the
dung
heap
in
the
mistal
what
were
you
doing
wi
thot
stoof
he
said
i
do
know
i
was
thinking
of
papa
after
that
he
never
left
her
until
rowcliffe
came
rowcliffe
said
she
got
it
into
her
head
he
going
to
die
and
she
thinks
she
killed
him
you
better
let
me
take
her
to
see
him
l
the
vicar
had
solved
his
problem
by
his
stroke
but
not
quite
as
he
had
anticipated
nothing
had
ever
turned
out
as
he
had
planned
or
thought
or
willed
he
had
planned
to
leave
the
parish
he
had
thought
that
in
his
wisdom
he
had
saved
alice
by
shutting
her
up
in
garthdale
he
had
thought
that
she
was
safe
at
with
jim
greatorex
he
had
thought
that
mary
was
devoted
to
him
and
that
gwenda
was
capable
of
all
disobedience
and
all
iniquity
she
had
gone
away
and
he
had
forbidden
her
to
come
back
again
he
had
also
forbidden
greatorex
to
enter
his
house
and
greatorex
was
entering
it
every
day
for
news
of
him
to
take
to
alice
at
upthorne
gwenda
had
come
back
and
would
never
go
again
and
it
was
she
and
not
mary
who
had
proved
herself
devoted
and
it
was
not
his
wisdom
but
greatorex
scandalous
passion
for
her
that
had
saved
alice
as
for
leaving
the
parish
because
of
the
scandal
the
vicar
would
never
leave
it
now
he
was
tied
there
in
his
vicarage
by
his
stroke
it
left
him
with
a
paralysis
of
the
right
side
and
an
utter
confusion
and
enfeeblement
of
intellect
in
three
months
he
recovered
partially
from
the
paralysis
but
the
flooding
of
his
brain
had
submerged
or
carried
away
whole
tracts
of
recent
memory
and
the
last
vivid
violent
impression
affair
was
wiped
out
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
stay
on
what
was
left
of
his
memory
told
him
that
alice
was
at
the
vicarage
and
he
was
worried
because
he
never
saw
her
about
he
did
not
know
that
the
small
gray
house
above
the
churchyard
had
become
a
place
of
sinister
and
scandalous
tragedy
that
his
name
and
his
youngest
daughter
name
were
bywords
in
three
parishes
and
that
alice
had
been
married
in
conspicuous
haste
by
the
horrified
vicar
of
greffington
to
a
man
whom
only
charitable
people
regarded
as
her
seducer
and
the
order
of
time
had
ceased
for
him
with
this
breach
in
the
sequence
of
events
he
had
a
dim
but
enduring
impression
that
it
was
always
prayer
time
no
hours
marked
the
long
stretches
of
blank
darkness
and
of
confused
and
crowded
twilight
only
now
and
then
a
little
light
pulsed
feebly
in
his
brain
a
flash
that
renewed
itself
day
by
day
and
day
by
day
in
a
fresh
experience
he
was
aware
that
he
was
ill
it
was
as
if
the
world
stood
still
and
his
mind
moved
it
wandered
as
they
said
and
in
its
wanderings
it
came
upon
strange
gaps
and
hollows
and
fantastic
dislocations
landslips
where
a
whole
foreground
had
given
way
it
looked
at
these
things
with
a
serene
and
dreamlike
wonder
and
passed
on
and
in
the
background
on
some
isolated
tract
of
memory
raised
above
ruin
and
infinitely
remote
he
saw
the
figure
of
his
youngest
daughter
it
was
a
girlish
innocent
figure
and
though
because
of
the
whiteness
of
its
face
he
confused
it
now
and
then
with
the
figure
of
alice
dead
mother
his
first
wife
he
was
aware
that
it
was
really
alice
this
figure
of
alice
moved
him
with
a
vague
and
tender
yearning
what
puzzled
and
worried
him
was
that
in
his
flashes
of
luminous
experience
he
did
see
her
there
and
it
was
then
that
the
vicar
would
make
himself
wonderful
and
piteous
by
asking
a
dozen
times
a
day
where
ally
for
by
the
stroke
that
made
him
wonderful
and
piteous
the
character
and
his
temperament
were
changed
nothing
was
left
of
tyrant
and
robina
victim
the
celibate
filled
with
the
fury
of
frustration
and
profoundly
sorry
for
himself
his
place
was
taken
by
a
gentle
old
man
an
old
man
of
an
appealing
and
childlike
innocence
pure
from
all
lust
from
all
enjoying
actually
enjoying
the
consideration
that
his
stroke
had
brought
him
he
was
changed
no
less
remarkably
in
his
affections
he
was
utterly
indifferent
to
mary
whom
he
had
been
fond
of
he
yearned
for
alice
whom
he
had
hated
and
he
clung
incessantly
to
gwenda
whom
he
had
feared
when
he
looked
round
in
his
strange
and
awful
gentleness
and
said
where
ally
his
voice
was
the
voice
of
a
mother
calling
for
her
child
and
when
he
said
where
gwenda
it
was
the
voice
of
a
child
calling
for
its
mother
and
as
he
continually
thought
that
alice
was
at
the
vicarage
when
she
was
at
upthorne
so
he
was
convinced
that
gwenda
had
left
him
when
she
was
there
rowcliffe
judged
that
this
confusion
of
the
vicar
would
be
favorable
to
his
experiment
and
it
was
when
cartaret
saw
his
youngest
daughter
for
the
first
time
since
their
violent
rupture
he
gazed
at
her
tranquilly
and
said
and
where
have
been
all
this
time
not
very
far
papa
he
smiled
sweetly
i
thought
you
run
away
from
your
poor
old
father
let
me
see
was
it
ally
my
memory
going
no
it
was
gwenda
who
ran
away
was
it
gwenda
yes
papa
well
she
must
come
back
again
i
ca
do
without
gwenda
she
has
come
back
papa
she
always
coming
hack
but
she
go
away
again
where
is
she
i
here
papa
dear
here
one
minute
said
the
vicar
and
gone
the
next
no
no
i
not
going
i
shall
never
go
away
and
leave
you
so
you
say
said
the
vicar
so
you
say
he
looked
round
uneasily
it
time
for
ally
to
go
to
bed
has
essy
brought
her
milk
his
head
bowed
to
his
breast
he
fell
into
a
doze
ally
watched
and
in
the
outer
room
gwenda
and
steven
rowcliffe
talked
together
steven
he
always
going
on
like
that
it
breaks
my
heart
i
know
dear
i
know
do
you
think
he
ever
remember
i
do
know
i
do
think
so
then
they
sat
together
without
speaking
she
was
thinking
how
good
he
is
surely
i
may
love
him
for
his
goodness
and
he
that
the
old
man
in
there
had
solved
problem
but
that
his
own
had
been
taken
out
of
his
hands
and
he
saw
no
solution
if
the
vicar
had
gone
away
and
taken
gwenda
with
him
that
would
have
solved
it
god
knew
he
had
been
willing
enough
to
solve
it
that
way
but
here
they
were
flung
together
thrust
toward
each
other
when
they
should
have
torn
themselves
apart
tied
both
of
them
to
a
place
they
could
not
leave
week
in
week
out
he
would
be
obliged
to
see
her
whether
he
would
or
no
and
when
her
tired
face
rebuked
his
senses
she
drew
him
by
her
tenderness
she
held
him
by
her
goodness
there
was
only
one
thing
for
him
to
do
to
clear
out
it
was
his
plain
and
simple
duty
if
it
had
been
for
alice
and
for
that
old
man
he
would
have
done
it
but
because
of
them
it
was
his
still
plainer
and
simpler
duty
to
stay
where
he
was
to
stick
to
her
and
see
her
through
he
could
help
it
if
his
problem
was
taken
out
of
his
hands
they
started
they
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
their
strained
and
tragic
smile
in
the
inner
room
the
vicar
was
calling
for
gwenda
it
was
prayer
time
he
said
rowcliffe
had
to
drive
alice
back
that
night
to
upthorne
well
he
said
as
they
left
the
vicarage
behind
them
you
see
he
is
going
to
die
no
said
alice
but
he
out
of
his
mind
i
have
killed
him
i
done
worse
i
driven
him
mad
and
she
stuck
to
it
she
could
afford
to
part
with
her
fear
yet
rowcliffe
was
distressed
at
the
failure
of
his
experiment
he
told
greatorex
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
wait
patiently
till
june
then
perhaps
they
would
see
in
his
own
mind
he
had
very
little
hope
he
said
to
himself
that
he
did
like
the
turn
ally
obsession
had
taken
it
was
morbid
but
when
may
came
alice
lay
in
the
big
bed
under
the
sagging
ceiling
with
a
lamentably
small
baby
in
her
arms
and
greatorex
sat
beside
her
by
the
hour
together
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
white
face
rowcliffe
had
told
him
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
some
new
thing
or
for
some
more
violent
sign
of
the
old
obsession
but
nine
days
had
passed
and
he
had
seen
no
sign
her
eyes
looked
at
him
and
at
her
child
with
the
same
lucid
drowsy
ecstasy
and
in
nine
days
she
had
only
asked
him
once
if
he
knew
how
poor
papa
was
her
fear
had
left
her
it
had
served
its
purpose
li
there
was
no
prayer
time
at
the
vicarage
any
more
there
was
no
more
time
at
all
there
as
the
world
counts
time
the
hours
no
longer
passed
in
a
procession
marked
by
distinguishable
days
they
rolled
round
and
round
in
an
interminable
circle
monotonously
renewed
monotonously
returning
upon
itself
the
vicar
was
the
center
of
the
circle
the
hours
were
sounded
and
measured
by
his
monotonously
recurring
needs
but
the
days
were
neither
measured
nor
marked
they
were
all
of
one
shade
there
was
no
difference
between
sunday
and
monday
in
the
vicarage
now
they
talked
of
the
vicar
good
days
and
his
bad
days
that
was
all
for
in
this
house
where
time
had
ceased
they
talked
incessantly
of
time
but
it
was
always
time
the
time
for
his
early
morning
cup
of
tea
the
time
for
his
medicine
the
time
for
his
breakfast
the
time
for
reading
his
chapter
to
him
while
he
dozed
the
time
for
washing
him
for
dressing
him
for
taking
him
out
he
went
out
now
in
a
drawn
by
peacock
pony
the
time
for
his
medicine
again
his
dinner
time
the
time
for
his
afternoon
sleep
his
the
time
for
his
last
dose
of
medicine
his
supper
time
and
his
time
for
being
undressed
and
put
to
bed
and
there
were
several
times
during
the
night
which
were
his
times
also
the
vicar
had
desired
supremacy
in
his
vicarage
and
he
was
at
last
supreme
he
was
supreme
over
his
daughter
gwenda
the
stubborn
intractable
creature
was
at
his
feet
she
was
his
to
bend
or
break
or
utterly
destroy
she
who
was
capable
of
anything
was
capable
of
an
indestructible
devotion
his
times
the
relentless
the
monotonously
recurring
were
her
times
too
if
it
had
not
been
for
steven
rowcliffe
she
would
have
had
none
to
call
her
own
except
night
time
when
the
vicar
slept
but
rowcliffe
had
kept
to
his
days
for
visiting
the
vicarage
he
came
twice
or
thrice
a
week
not
counting
wednesdays
only
though
mary
did
not
know
it
he
came
as
often
as
not
in
the
evenings
at
dusk
just
after
the
vicar
had
been
put
to
bed
when
it
was
wet
he
sat
in
the
with
gwenda
when
it
was
fine
he
took
her
out
on
to
the
moor
under
karva
they
always
went
the
same
way
up
the
green
that
they
knew
they
always
turned
back
at
the
same
place
where
the
stream
he
had
seen
her
jumping
ran
from
the
hill
and
they
always
took
the
same
time
to
go
and
turn
they
never
stopped
and
never
lingered
but
went
always
at
the
same
sharp
pace
and
kept
the
same
distance
from
each
other
it
was
as
if
by
saying
to
themselves
never
any
further
than
the
stream
never
any
longer
than
minutes
never
any
nearer
than
we
are
now
they
defined
the
limits
of
their
whole
relation
sometimes
they
hardly
spoke
as
they
walked
they
parted
with
casual
words
and
with
no
touching
of
their
hands
and
with
the
same
thought
unspoken
till
the
next
time
but
these
times
which
were
theirs
only
did
not
count
as
time
they
belonged
to
another
scale
of
feeling
and
another
order
of
reality
their
moments
had
another
pulse
another
rhythm
and
vibration
they
burned
as
they
beat
while
they
lasted
gwenda
life
was
lived
with
an
intensity
that
left
time
outside
its
measure
through
this
intensity
she
drew
the
strength
to
go
on
to
endure
the
unendurable
with
joy
but
rowcliffe
could
not
endure
the
unendurable
at
all
he
was
savage
when
he
thought
of
it
that
was
her
life
and
she
would
never
get
away
from
it
she
who
was
born
for
the
wild
open
air
and
for
youth
and
strength
and
freedom
would
be
shut
up
in
that
house
and
tied
to
that
old
man
forever
it
was
damnable
and
he
rowcliffe
could
have
prevented
it
if
he
had
only
known
and
if
mary
had
not
lied
to
him
and
when
his
common
sense
warned
him
of
their
danger
and
his
conscience
reproached
him
with
leading
her
into
it
he
said
to
himself
i
ca
help
it
if
it
is
dangerous
it
been
taken
out
of
my
hands
if
somebody
does
drag
her
out
of
doors
she
get
ill
if
somebody
does
talk
to
her
she
grow
morbid
and
there
nobody
but
me
he
sheltered
himself
in
the
immensity
of
her
tragedy
its
darkness
covered
them
her
sadness
and
her
isolation
sanctified
them
alice
had
her
husband
and
her
child
mary
had
all
she
wanted
gwenda
had
nobody
but
him
she
had
never
had
anybody
but
him
for
in
the
beginning
the
vicar
and
his
daughters
had
failed
to
make
friends
among
their
own
sort
up
in
the
dale
there
had
been
few
to
make
and
those
few
cartaret
had
contrived
to
alienate
one
after
another
by
his
deplorable
legend
and
by
the
austere
unpleasantness
of
his
personality
people
had
not
been
prepared
for
intimacy
with
a
vicar
separated
so
outrageously
from
his
third
wife
nobody
knew
whether
it
was
he
or
his
third
wife
who
had
been
outrageous
but
the
vicar
manner
was
not
such
as
to
procure
for
him
the
benefit
of
any
doubt
the
fact
remained
that
the
poor
man
was
handicapped
by
an
outrageous
daughter
and
alice
behavior
was
obviously
as
much
the
vicar
fault
as
his
misfortune
and
it
had
been
felt
that
gwenda
had
not
done
anything
to
redeem
her
father
and
her
sister
eccentricities
and
that
mary
though
she
was
a
nice
girl
had
hardly
done
enough
for
the
last
eighteen
months
visits
at
the
vicarage
had
been
perfunctory
and
very
brief
month
by
month
they
had
diminished
and
before
mary
marriage
they
had
almost
ceased
still
mary
marriage
had
appeased
the
parish
steven
rowcliffe
had
atoned
for
the
third
cartaret
suspicious
absence
and
for
gwenda
cartaret
flight
lady
frances
gilbey
large
wing
had
further
protected
gwenda
then
suddenly
the
tale
of
alice
cartaret
and
greatorex
went
round
and
it
was
as
if
the
vicarage
had
opened
and
given
up
its
secret
at
first
the
sheer
extremity
of
his
disaster
had
sheltered
the
vicar
from
his
own
scandal
through
all
garthdale
and
rathdale
in
the
manors
and
the
lodges
and
the
granges
in
the
farmhouses
and
the
cottages
in
the
inns
and
little
shops
there
was
a
stir
of
pity
and
compassion
the
people
who
had
left
off
calling
at
the
vicarage
called
again
with
sympathy
and
kind
inquiries
they
were
inclined
to
forget
how
impossible
the
cartarets
had
been
they
were
sorry
for
gwenda
but
they
had
been
checked
in
their
advances
by
gwenda
palpable
recoil
she
had
no
time
to
give
to
callers
her
father
had
taken
all
her
time
the
callers
considered
themselves
absolved
from
calling
slowly
month
by
month
the
vicarage
was
drawn
back
into
its
silence
and
its
loneliness
it
assumed
more
and
more
its
aspect
of
tragedy
the
vicar
calamity
no
longer
sheltered
him
it
took
its
place
in
the
order
of
accepted
and
irremediable
events
only
the
village
preserved
its
sympathy
alive
the
village
that
obscure
congregated
soul
to
calamity
welded
together
by
saner
instincts
and
profound
in
memory
the
soul
that
inhabited
the
small
huddled
humble
houses
divided
from
the
vicarage
by
no
more
than
the
graveyard
of
its
dead
the
village
remembered
and
it
knew
it
remembered
how
the
vicar
had
come
and
gone
over
its
thresholds
how
no
rain
nor
snow
nor
storm
had
stayed
him
in
his
obstinate
and
punctual
visiting
and
whereas
it
had
once
looked
grimly
on
its
vicar
it
looked
kindly
on
him
now
it
endured
him
for
his
daughter
sake
in
spite
of
what
it
knew
for
it
knew
why
the
vicar
third
wife
had
left
him
it
knew
why
alice
cartaret
had
gone
wrong
with
greatorex
it
knew
what
gwenda
cartaret
had
gone
for
when
she
went
away
it
knew
why
and
how
rowcliffe
had
married
mary
cartaret
and
it
knew
why
night
after
night
he
was
to
be
seen
coming
and
going
on
the
garthdale
road
the
village
knew
more
about
rowcliffe
and
gwenda
cartaret
than
rowcliffe
wife
knew
for
rowcliffe
wife
mind
was
closed
to
this
knowledge
by
a
certain
sensual
assurance
when
all
was
said
and
done
it
was
she
and
not
gwenda
who
was
rowcliffe
wife
and
she
had
other
grounds
for
complacency
her
sister
a
solitary
miss
cartaret
stowed
away
in
garth
vicarage
was
of
no
account
she
did
matter
and
as
mary
cartaret
mary
would
have
mattered
even
less
but
steven
professional
reputation
served
him
well
he
counted
people
who
had
begun
by
trusting
him
had
ended
by
liking
him
and
in
two
years
time
his
social
value
had
become
apparent
and
as
steven
rowcliffe
mary
had
a
social
value
too
but
while
steven
who
had
always
had
it
took
it
for
granted
and
never
thought
about
it
mary
could
think
of
nothing
else
her
social
value
obscured
by
the
terrible
two
years
in
garthdale
had
come
to
her
as
a
discovery
and
an
acquisition
for
all
her
complacency
she
could
not
regard
it
as
a
secure
thing
she
was
sensitive
to
every
breath
that
threatened
it
she
was
unable
to
forget
that
if
she
was
steven
rowcliffe
wife
she
was
alice
greatorex
sister
even
as
mary
cartaret
she
had
been
sensitive
to
alice
but
in
those
days
of
obscurity
and
isolation
it
was
not
in
her
to
cast
alice
off
she
had
felt
bound
to
alice
not
as
gwenda
was
bound
but
pitiably
irrevocably
for
better
for
worse
the
solidarity
of
the
family
had
held
she
had
not
had
anything
to
lose
by
sticking
to
her
sister
now
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
everything
to
lose
the
thought
of
alice
was
a
perpetual
annoyance
to
her
for
the
neighborhood
that
had
received
steven
rowcliffe
had
barred
her
sister
as
long
as
alice
greatorex
lived
at
upthorne
mary
went
in
fear
this
fear
was
so
intolerable
to
her
that
at
last
she
spoke
of
it
to
rowcliffe
they
were
sitting
together
in
his
study
after
dinner
the
two
armchairs
were
always
facing
now
one
on
each
side
of
the
hearth
i
wish
i
knew
what
to
do
about
alice
she
said
what
to
about
her
yes
am
i
to
have
her
at
the
house
or
not
he
stared
of
course
you
to
have
her
at
the
house
i
mean
when
we
got
people
here
i
ca
ask
her
to
meet
them
you
must
ask
her
it
the
very
least
you
can
do
for
her
people
are
going
to
like
it
steven
people
have
got
to
stick
a
great
many
things
they
are
going
to
like
i
continually
meeting
people
i
rather
not
meet
are
you
i
afraid
poor
alice
is
is
what
well
dear
a
little
impossible
to
say
the
least
of
it
is
she
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
do
see
anything
impossible
about
alice
i
never
did
it
nice
of
you
to
say
so
he
maintained
himself
in
silence
under
her
long
gaze
steven
she
said
you
are
awfully
good
to
my
people
she
saw
that
she
could
hardly
have
said
anything
that
would
have
annoyed
him
more
he
positively
writhed
with
irritation
i
not
in
the
least
good
to
your
people
the
words
stung
her
like
a
blow
she
flushed
and
he
softened
ca
you
see
molly
that
i
hate
the
infernal
humbug
and
the
cruelty
of
it
all
that
poor
child
had
a
dog
life
before
she
married
she
did
the
only
sane
thing
that
was
open
to
her
you
only
got
to
look
at
her
now
to
see
that
she
could
have
done
much
better
for
herself
even
if
she
had
been
driven
to
it
what
more
she
done
the
best
thing
for
greatorex
there
is
another
woman
in
the
world
who
could
have
made
that
chap
chuck
drinking
you
may
like
the
connection
i
do
suppose
any
of
us
like
it
my
dear
steven
it
is
only
the
connection
i
could
get
over
that
it
the
other
thing
his
blank
stare
compelled
her
to
precision
i
mean
what
happened
well
if
gwenda
can
get
over
other
thing
i
should
think
might
she
has
to
see
more
of
her
it
different
for
gwenda
how
is
it
different
for
gwenda
she
hesitated
she
had
meant
that
gwenda
had
anything
to
lose
what
she
said
was
gwenda
has
anybody
but
herself
to
think
of
she
has
let
you
in
for
alice
no
more
have
you
he
smiled
mary
did
not
understand
either
his
answer
or
his
smile
he
was
saying
to
himself
oh
has
she
it
was
gwenda
all
the
time
who
let
me
in
mary
had
a
little
rush
of
affection
my
dear
i
think
i
let
you
in
for
everything
i
would
mind
i
would
really
if
it
was
for
you
you
need
bother
about
me
he
said
i
rather
you
bothered
about
your
sister
which
sister
for
the
life
of
her
she
could
not
tell
what
had
made
her
say
that
the
words
seemed
to
leap
out
suddenly
from
her
mind
to
her
tongue
alice
he
said
was
it
alice
we
were
talking
about
it
was
alice
i
was
thinking
about
was
it
again
her
mind
took
its
insane
possession
of
her
tongue
the
evening
dragged
on
the
two
chairs
still
faced
each
other
pushed
forward
in
their
attitude
of
polite
attention
and
expectancy
but
the
persons
in
the
chairs
leaned
back
as
if
each
withdrew
as
far
as
possible
from
the
other
they
made
themselves
stiff
and
upright
as
if
they
braced
themselves
each
against
the
other
in
the
unconscious
tension
of
hostility
and
they
were
silent
each
thinking
an
intolerable
thought
rowcliffe
had
taken
up
a
book
and
was
pretending
to
read
it
hands
were
busy
with
her
knitting
her
needles
went
with
a
rapid
jerk
driven
by
the
vibration
of
her
irritated
nerves
from
time
to
time
she
glanced
at
rowcliffe
under
her
bent
brows
she
saw
the
same
blocks
of
print
a
deep
block
at
the
top
a
short
line
under
it
then
a
narrower
block
she
saw
them
as
vague
meaningless
blurs
of
gray
stippled
on
white
she
saw
that
rowcliffe
eyes
never
moved
from
the
deep
top
paragraph
on
the
page
she
noted
the
light
pressure
of
his
thumbs
on
the
margins
he
was
reading
at
all
he
was
only
pretending
to
read
he
had
set
up
his
book
as
a
barrier
between
them
and
he
was
holding
on
to
it
for
dear
life
rowcliffe
moved
irritably
under
mary
eyes
she
lowered
them
and
waited
for
the
silken
sound
that
should
have
told
her
that
he
had
turned
a
page
and
all
the
time
she
kept
on
saying
to
herself
he
thinking
about
gwenda
he
sorry
for
alice
because
of
gwenda
not
because
of
me
it
is
people
that
he
good
to
the
thought
went
round
and
round
in
mary
mind
troubling
its
tranquillity
she
knew
that
something
followed
from
it
but
she
refused
to
see
it
her
mind
thrust
from
it
the
conclusion
then
it
gwenda
that
he
cares
for
she
said
to
herself
after
all
i
married
to
him
and
as
she
said
it
she
thrust
up
her
chin
in
a
gesture
of
assurance
and
defiance
in
the
chair
that
faced
her
rowcliffe
shifted
his
position
he
crossed
his
legs
and
the
tilted
foot
kicked
out
urged
by
a
hidden
savagery
the
clicking
of
mary
needles
maddened
him
he
glanced
at
her
she
was
knitting
a
silk
tie
for
his
birthday
she
saw
the
glance
the
fierceness
of
the
small
fingers
slackened
they
knitted
off
a
row
or
two
then
ceased
her
hands
lay
quiet
in
her
lap
she
leaned
her
head
against
the
back
of
the
chair
her
grieved
eyes
let
down
their
lids
before
the
smouldering
hostility
in
his
her
stillness
and
her
shut
eyes
moved
him
to
compunction
they
appeased
him
with
reminiscence
with
suggestion
of
her
smooth
and
innocent
sleep
he
had
been
thinking
of
what
she
had
done
to
him
of
how
she
had
lied
to
him
about
gwenda
of
the
abominable
thing
that
alice
had
cried
out
to
him
in
her
agony
the
thought
of
mary
turpitude
had
consoled
him
mysteriously
instead
of
putting
it
from
him
he
had
dwelt
on
it
he
had
wallowed
in
it
he
had
let
it
soak
into
him
till
he
was
poisoned
with
it
for
the
sting
of
it
and
the
violence
of
his
own
resentment
were
more
tolerable
to
rowcliffe
than
the
stale
dull
realisation
of
the
fact
that
mary
bored
him
it
had
come
to
that
he
had
nothing
to
say
to
mary
now
that
he
had
married
her
his
romantic
youth
still
moved
uneasily
within
him
it
found
no
peace
in
an
armchair
facing
mary
he
dreaded
these
evenings
that
he
was
compelled
to
spend
with
her
he
dreaded
her
speech
he
dreaded
her
silences
ten
times
more
they
no
longer
soothed
him
they
were
pervading
menacing
significant
he
thought
that
mary
turpitude
accounted
for
and
justified
the
exasperation
of
his
nerves
now
as
he
looked
at
her
lying
back
in
the
limp
pose
reminiscent
of
her
sleep
he
thought
poor
thing
poor
molly
he
put
down
his
book
he
stood
over
her
a
moment
sighed
a
long
sigh
like
a
yawn
turned
from
her
and
went
to
bed
mary
opened
her
eyes
sighed
stretched
herself
put
out
the
light
and
followed
him
lii
not
long
after
that
night
it
struck
mary
that
steven
was
run
down
he
worked
too
hard
that
was
how
she
accounted
to
herself
for
his
fits
of
exhaustion
of
irritability
and
depression
but
secretly
for
all
her
complacence
she
had
divined
the
cause
she
watched
him
now
she
inquired
into
his
goings
out
and
comings
in
sometimes
she
knew
that
he
had
been
to
garthdale
and
though
he
went
there
many
more
times
than
she
knew
she
had
noticed
that
these
moods
of
his
followed
invariably
on
his
going
it
was
as
if
gwenda
left
her
mark
on
him
so
much
was
certain
and
by
that
certainty
she
went
on
to
infer
his
going
from
his
mood
one
day
she
taxed
him
with
it
rowcliffe
had
tried
to
excuse
his
early
morning
temper
on
the
plea
that
he
was
beastly
tired
tired
she
had
said
of
course
you
tired
if
you
went
up
to
garthdale
last
night
she
added
it
is
necessary
he
was
silent
and
she
knew
that
she
was
on
his
trail
two
evenings
later
she
caught
him
as
he
was
leaving
the
house
where
are
you
going
she
said
i
going
up
to
garthdale
to
see
your
father
her
eyes
flinched
you
saw
him
yesterday
i
did
is
he
worse
he
hesitated
lying
had
not
as
yet
come
lightly
to
him
i
not
easy
about
him
he
said
she
was
not
satisfied
she
had
caught
the
hesitation
ca
you
tell
me
she
persisted
if
he
worse
he
looked
at
her
calmly
i
ca
tell
you
till
i
seen
him
that
roused
her
she
bit
her
lip
she
knew
that
whatever
she
did
she
must
not
show
temper
did
gwenda
send
for
you
her
voice
was
quiet
she
did
not
he
strode
out
of
the
house
after
that
he
never
told
her
when
he
was
going
up
to
garthdale
toward
nightfall
he
was
sometimes
driven
to
lie
it
was
up
rathdale
he
was
going
or
to
greffington
or
to
smoke
a
pipe
with
ned
alderson
or
to
turn
in
for
a
game
of
billiards
at
the
village
club
and
whenever
he
lied
to
her
she
saw
through
him
she
was
prepared
for
the
lie
she
said
to
herself
he
is
going
to
see
gwenda
he
keep
away
from
her
and
then
she
remembered
what
alice
had
said
to
her
you
know
some
day
she
knew
liii
and
with
her
knowledge
there
came
a
curious
calm
she
no
longer
watched
and
worried
rowcliffe
she
knew
that
no
wife
ever
kept
her
husband
by
watching
and
worrying
him
she
was
aware
of
danger
and
she
faced
it
with
restored
complacency
for
mary
was
a
fount
of
sensual
wisdom
rowcliffe
was
and
from
his
illness
she
inferred
his
misery
and
from
his
misery
his
innocence
she
told
herself
that
nothing
had
happened
that
she
knew
nothing
that
she
had
not
known
before
she
saw
that
her
mistake
had
been
in
showing
that
she
knew
it
that
was
to
admit
it
and
to
admit
it
was
to
give
it
a
substance
a
shape
and
color
it
had
never
had
and
was
not
likely
to
have
and
mary
having
perceived
her
blunder
set
herself
to
repair
it
she
knew
how
under
all
his
energy
she
had
discerned
in
her
husband
a
love
of
bodily
ease
and
a
capacity
for
laziness
undeveloped
because
perpetually
frustrated
insidiously
she
had
set
herself
to
undermine
his
energy
while
she
devised
continual
opportunities
for
ease
rowcliffe
remained
incurably
energetic
his
profession
demanded
energy
still
there
were
ways
by
which
he
could
be
captured
he
was
not
so
deeply
absorbed
in
his
profession
as
to
be
indifferent
to
the
arrangements
of
his
home
he
liked
and
he
showed
very
plainly
that
he
liked
good
food
and
silent
service
the
shining
of
glass
and
silver
white
table
linen
and
fragrant
sheets
for
his
bed
with
all
these
things
mary
had
provided
him
and
she
had
her
own
magic
and
her
way
her
way
the
way
she
had
caught
him
was
the
way
she
would
keep
him
she
had
always
known
her
power
even
unpracticed
she
had
always
known
by
instinct
how
she
could
enthrall
him
when
her
moment
came
gwenda
had
put
back
the
hour
but
she
had
done
and
mary
argued
that
therefore
she
could
do
no
more
here
mary
complacency
betrayed
her
she
had
fallen
into
the
error
of
all
innocent
and
tranquil
sensualists
she
trusted
to
the
present
she
had
reckoned
without
rowcliffe
future
or
his
past
and
she
had
done
even
worse
by
habituating
rowcliffe
senses
to
her
way
she
had
produced
in
him
through
sheer
satisfaction
that
sense
of
security
which
is
the
most
dangerous
sense
of
all
liv
one
week
in
june
rowcliffe
went
up
to
garthdale
two
nights
running
he
had
never
done
this
before
and
he
had
had
to
lie
badly
about
it
both
to
himself
and
mary
he
had
told
himself
that
the
first
evening
did
count
for
he
had
quarreled
with
gwenda
the
first
evening
neither
of
them
knew
how
it
had
happened
or
what
it
was
about
but
he
had
hardly
come
before
he
had
left
her
in
his
anger
the
actual
outburst
moved
her
only
to
laughter
but
the
memory
of
it
was
violent
in
her
nerves
it
shook
and
shattered
her
she
had
not
slept
all
night
and
in
the
morning
she
woke
tired
and
and
as
if
he
had
known
what
he
had
done
to
her
he
came
to
see
her
the
next
evening
to
make
up
that
night
they
stayed
out
later
than
they
had
meant
as
they
touched
the
moor
the
lambs
stirred
at
their
mothers
sides
and
the
pewits
rose
and
followed
the
white
road
to
lure
them
from
their
secret
places
they
wheeled
and
wheeled
round
them
sending
out
their
bored
and
weary
cry
in
june
the
young
broods
kept
the
moor
and
the
two
were
forced
to
the
white
road
and
at
the
turn
they
came
in
sight
of
greffington
edge
she
stood
still
oh
steven
look
she
said
he
stood
with
her
and
looked
the
moon
was
hidden
in
the
haze
where
the
gray
day
and
the
white
night
were
mixed
across
the
bottom
on
the
dim
watery
green
of
the
eastern
slope
the
thorn
trees
were
in
flower
the
hot
air
held
them
like
still
water
it
quivered
invisibly
loosening
their
scent
and
scattering
it
and
of
a
sudden
she
saw
them
as
if
thrown
back
to
a
distance
where
they
stood
enchanted
in
a
great
stillness
and
clearness
and
a
piercing
beauty
there
went
through
her
a
sudden
deep
excitement
a
subtle
and
mysterious
joy
this
passion
was
as
distant
and
as
pure
as
ecstasy
it
swept
her
while
the
white
glamour
lasted
into
the
stillness
where
the
flowering
thorn
trees
stood
she
wondered
whether
steven
had
seen
the
vision
of
the
flowering
thorn
trees
she
longed
for
him
to
see
it
they
stood
a
little
apart
and
her
hand
moved
toward
him
without
touching
him
as
if
she
would
draw
him
to
the
magic
steven
she
said
he
came
to
her
her
hand
hung
limply
by
her
side
again
she
felt
his
hand
close
on
it
and
press
it
she
knew
that
he
had
seen
the
vision
and
felt
the
subtle
and
mysterious
joy
she
wanted
nothing
more
say
now
she
said
not
yet
i
going
to
walk
back
with
you
they
walked
back
in
a
silence
that
guarded
the
memory
of
the
mystic
thing
they
lingered
a
moment
by
the
door
she
on
the
threshold
he
on
the
garden
path
the
width
of
a
flagstone
separated
them
in
another
minute
she
thought
he
will
be
gone
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
wanted
to
be
gone
and
that
it
was
she
who
held
him
there
against
his
will
and
her
own
she
drew
the
door
to
do
shut
it
gwenda
it
was
as
if
he
said
do
let
stand
together
out
here
like
this
any
longer
she
opened
the
door
again
leaning
a
little
toward
it
across
the
threshold
with
her
hand
on
the
latch
she
smiled
raising
her
chin
in
the
distant
gesture
that
was
their
signal
of
withdrawal
but
steven
did
not
go
may
i
come
in
he
said
something
in
her
said
do
let
him
come
in
but
she
did
not
heed
it
the
voice
was
thin
and
small
and
utterly
insignificant
as
if
one
little
brain
cell
had
waked
up
and
started
speaking
on
its
own
account
and
something
seized
on
her
tongue
and
made
it
say
yes
and
the
full
tide
of
her
blood
surged
into
her
throat
and
choked
it
and
neither
the
one
voice
nor
the
other
seemed
to
be
her
own
he
followed
her
into
the
little
where
the
lamp
was
the
vicar
was
in
bed
the
whole
house
was
still
rowcliffe
looked
at
her
in
the
lamplight
we
walked
a
bit
too
far
he
said
he
made
her
lean
back
on
the
couch
he
put
a
pillow
at
her
head
and
a
footstool
at
her
feet
just
rest
he
said
and
she
rested
but
rowcliffe
did
not
rest
he
moved
uneasily
about
the
room
a
sudden
tiredness
came
over
her
she
thought
yes
we
walked
too
far
she
leaned
her
head
back
on
the
cushion
her
thin
arms
lay
stretched
out
on
either
side
of
her
supported
by
the
couch
rowcliffe
ceased
to
wander
he
drew
up
with
his
back
against
the
where
he
faced
her
close
your
eyes
he
said
she
did
not
close
them
but
the
tired
lids
drooped
the
lifted
bow
of
her
mouth
drooped
the
small
breasts
drooped
and
as
he
watched
her
he
remembered
how
he
had
quarreled
with
her
in
that
room
last
night
and
the
thought
of
his
brutality
was
intolerable
to
him
his
heart
ached
with
tenderness
and
his
tenderness
was
intolerable
too
the
small
white
face
with
its
suffering
eyes
and
drooping
eyelids
the
drooping
breasts
the
thin
white
arms
slackened
along
the
couch
the
childlike
helplessness
of
the
tired
body
moved
him
with
a
vehement
desire
and
his
strength
that
had
withstood
her
in
her
swift
defiant
beauty
melted
away
steven
do
speak
he
said
she
was
quiet
for
a
moment
but
i
want
to
steven
i
want
to
say
something
he
sighed
well
say
it
it
something
i
want
to
ask
you
do
ask
impossibilities
i
do
think
it
impossible
at
least
it
would
be
if
you
really
knew
i
want
you
to
be
more
careful
with
me
she
paused
he
turned
from
her
abruptly
his
turning
made
it
easier
for
her
she
went
on
it
only
a
little
thing
a
silly
little
thing
i
want
you
when
you
angry
with
me
not
to
show
it
quite
so
much
he
had
turned
again
to
her
suddenly
the
look
on
his
face
stopped
her
i
never
angry
with
you
he
said
i
know
you
are
really
i
know
i
know
but
you
make
me
think
you
are
and
it
hurts
so
terribly
i
did
know
you
minded
i
do
always
mind
but
sometimes
when
i
stupid
i
simply
bear
it
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
done
something
last
night
i
got
it
into
my
head
what
did
you
get
into
your
head
tell
me
i
thought
i
made
you
hate
me
i
thought
you
thought
i
was
awful
like
poor
ally
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
sent
it
out
again
you
know
what
i
think
of
you
he
looked
at
her
threw
up
his
head
suddenly
and
went
to
her
his
words
came
fast
now
and
thick
you
know
i
love
you
that
why
i
been
such
a
brute
to
you
because
i
could
have
you
in
my
arms
and
it
made
me
mad
and
you
know
it
that
what
you
mean
when
you
say
it
hurts
you
you
sha
be
hurt
any
more
i
going
to
end
it
he
stooped
over
her
suddenly
steadying
himself
by
his
two
hands
laid
on
the
back
of
her
chair
she
put
out
her
arms
and
pushed
with
her
hands
against
his
shoulders
as
if
she
would
have
beaten
him
off
he
sank
to
her
knees
and
there
caught
her
hands
in
his
and
kissed
them
he
held
them
together
helpless
with
his
left
arm
and
his
right
arm
gathered
her
to
him
violently
and
close
his
mouth
came
crushing
upon
her
parted
lips
and
her
shut
eyes
her
small
thin
hands
struggled
piteously
in
his
and
for
pity
he
released
them
he
felt
them
pushing
with
their
palms
against
his
face
their
struggle
and
their
resistance
were
pain
to
him
and
exquisite
pleasure
not
that
steven
not
that
oh
i
did
think
i
did
think
you
would
do
send
me
away
gwenda
it
all
right
we
suffered
enough
we
got
to
end
it
this
way
no
not
this
way
yes
yes
it
all
right
darling
we
struggled
till
we
struggle
any
more
you
must
why
not
when
you
love
me
he
pressed
her
closer
in
his
arms
she
lay
quiet
there
when
she
was
quiet
he
let
her
speak
i
ca
she
said
it
molly
poor
little
molly
do
talk
to
me
of
molly
she
lied
about
you
whatever
she
did
she
could
help
it
whatever
we
do
now
we
ca
help
it
we
can
we
different
oh
do
do
hold
me
like
that
i
bear
it
his
arms
tightened
his
mouth
found
hers
again
as
if
he
had
not
heard
her
she
gave
a
faint
cry
that
pierced
him
he
looked
at
her
the
lips
he
had
kissed
were
a
purplish
white
in
her
thin
bloodless
face
i
say
are
you
ill
she
saw
her
advantage
and
took
it
no
but
i
ca
stand
things
very
well
they
make
me
that
what
i
meant
when
i
asked
you
to
be
careful
her
helplessness
stilled
his
passion
as
it
had
roused
it
he
released
her
suddenly
he
took
the
thin
arm
surrendered
to
his
gentleness
turned
back
her
sleeve
and
felt
the
tense
jerking
pulse
he
saw
what
she
had
meant
do
you
mind
my
sitting
beside
you
if
i
keep
quiet
she
shook
her
head
can
you
stand
my
talking
about
it
yes
if
you
do
touch
me
i
wo
touch
you
we
got
to
face
the
thing
it
making
you
it
is
what
is
then
living
with
papa
he
smiled
through
his
agony
that
only
another
name
for
it
it
ca
go
on
why
should
we
be
happy
why
should
we
he
insisted
it
not
as
if
we
had
tried
i
ca
you
afraid
oh
no
i
not
afraid
it
simply
that
i
ca
you
think
it
a
sin
it
is
it
we
who
are
sinned
against
if
you
afraid
of
deceiving
mary
i
do
care
if
i
do
she
deceived
me
first
besides
we
ca
she
knows
and
she
does
mind
she
ca
suffer
as
you
suffer
she
ca
feel
as
you
feel
she
care
she
does
care
she
must
have
cared
horribly
or
she
would
have
done
it
she
did
anybody
would
have
done
for
her
as
well
as
me
i
tell
you
i
do
want
to
talk
about
mary
or
to
think
about
her
then
i
must
no
you
must
think
of
me
you
do
owe
anything
to
mary
it
me
you
sinning
against
you
think
a
lot
about
sinning
against
mary
but
you
think
nothing
about
sinning
against
me
when
did
i
ever
sin
against
you
last
year
when
you
went
away
that
was
the
beginning
of
it
all
why
you
go
gwenda
you
knew
we
should
have
been
all
right
if
you
had
i
went
because
of
ally
she
had
to
be
married
i
thought
perhaps
if
i
was
there
that
i
marry
her
good
god
ally
what
on
earth
made
you
think
i
do
that
i
would
have
married
her
if
there
had
been
another
woman
in
the
world
i
could
be
sure
but
after
what
you
said
about
her
i
had
to
give
her
a
chance
what
i
say
that
she
die
or
go
mad
if
somebody
did
marry
her
i
never
said
that
i
would
be
likely
to
but
you
did
dear
you
frightened
me
so
i
went
away
to
see
if
that
would
make
it
any
better
any
better
for
whom
for
ally
oh
ally
i
see
i
thought
if
it
did
if
you
did
marry
her
i
could
come
back
again
and
when
i
did
come
back
you
married
mary
and
mary
knew
that
there
no
good
bothering
about
mary
now
utterly
weary
of
their
strife
she
lay
back
and
closed
her
eyes
poor
gwenda
again
he
had
compassion
on
her
he
waited
you
see
how
it
was
she
said
it
does
help
us
much
dear
what
are
we
going
to
do
not
what
you
want
steven
i
afraid
not
now
but
some
day
you
see
it
differently
when
you
thought
of
it
never
never
any
day
i
had
all
these
months
to
think
of
it
and
i
ca
see
it
differently
yet
you
thought
of
it
not
like
that
but
you
did
think
you
knew
it
would
come
to
this
i
tried
not
to
make
it
come
do
you
know
why
i
tried
i
do
think
it
was
for
molly
it
was
for
myself
it
was
because
i
wanted
to
keep
you
that
why
i
shall
never
do
what
you
want
but
that
how
you
keep
me
there
no
other
way
she
rose
with
a
sudden
gesture
of
her
shoulders
as
if
she
shook
off
the
obsession
of
him
she
stood
leaning
against
the
in
the
attitude
he
knew
an
attitude
of
insolent
adolescent
grace
that
gave
her
the
advantage
her
eyes
disdained
their
pathos
they
looked
at
him
with
laughter
under
their
dropped
lids
how
funny
we
are
she
said
when
we
know
all
the
time
we
really
do
a
caddish
thing
like
that
he
smiled
queerly
i
suppose
we
could
he
too
rose
and
faced
her
do
you
know
what
this
means
he
said
it
means
that
i
got
to
clear
out
of
this
oh
steven
the
brave
light
in
her
face
went
out
you
would
go
away
and
leave
me
god
knows
i
do
want
to
leave
you
gwenda
but
we
ca
go
on
like
this
how
can
we
i
could
well
i
ca
that
what
it
means
to
me
that
what
it
means
to
a
man
if
we
going
to
be
straight
we
simply
must
see
each
other
do
you
mean
for
always
that
we
never
to
see
each
other
again
yes
if
it
to
be
any
good
steven
i
can
bear
anything
but
that
it
mean
that
i
tell
you
it
what
it
means
for
me
there
no
good
talking
about
it
you
seen
what
i
been
like
tonight
this
this
is
nothing
you
get
over
this
but
think
what
it
would
mean
to
me
it
would
be
hard
i
know
hard
not
half
so
hard
as
this
but
i
can
bear
this
we
been
so
happy
we
can
be
happy
still
this
is
happiness
it
happiness
it
all
i
got
it
all
i
ever
had
what
is
seeing
you
or
not
even
seeing
you
knowing
you
there
poor
child
does
that
make
you
happy
utterly
happy
always
i
did
know
he
stooped
forward
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
you
do
realise
it
you
no
idea
what
it
mean
to
be
boxed
up
in
this
place
together
all
our
lives
with
this
between
us
it
always
been
between
us
we
shall
be
no
worse
off
it
may
have
been
bad
now
and
then
but
conceive
what
it
be
like
when
you
go
i
suppose
it
would
be
pretty
beastly
for
you
if
i
did
go
would
it
be
too
awful
for
you
if
you
stayed
he
was
a
long
time
before
he
answered
not
if
it
really
made
you
happier
happier
she
smiled
her
pitiful
strained
smile
it
said
do
you
see
that
it
would
kill
me
if
you
went
and
again
it
was
by
her
difference
her
helplessness
that
she
had
him
he
too
smiled
drearily
you
do
suppose
i
really
could
have
left
you
he
saw
that
it
was
impossible
unthinkable
that
he
should
leave
her
he
rose
she
went
with
him
to
the
door
she
thought
of
something
there
steven
she
said
do
worry
about
it
was
all
my
fault
you
you
he
murmured
you
adorable
it
was
really
she
said
i
made
you
come
in
she
gave
him
her
cold
hand
he
raised
it
and
brushed
it
with
his
lips
and
put
it
from
him
your
little
conscience
was
always
too
tender
lv
two
years
passed
life
stirred
again
in
the
vicarage
feebly
and
slowly
with
the
slow
and
feeble
stirring
of
the
vicar
brain
ten
was
prayer
time
again
twice
every
sunday
the
vicar
appeared
in
his
seat
in
the
chancel
twice
he
pronounced
the
absolution
twice
he
tottered
to
the
altar
rails
turned
shifted
his
stick
from
his
left
hand
to
his
right
and
with
his
one
good
arm
raised
he
gave
the
benediction
these
were
the
supreme
moments
of
his
life
once
a
month
kneeling
at
the
same
altar
rails
he
received
the
bread
and
wine
from
the
hands
of
his
ritualistic
curate
grierson
it
was
his
uttermost
abasement
but
whether
he
was
abased
or
exalted
the
parish
was
proud
of
its
vicar
he
had
shown
grit
his
parishioners
respected
the
indestructible
instinct
that
had
made
him
hold
on
for
cartaret
was
better
incredibly
better
he
could
creep
about
the
house
and
the
village
without
any
help
but
his
stick
he
could
wash
and
feed
and
dress
himself
he
had
no
longer
any
use
for
his
once
a
week
on
a
wednesday
he
was
driven
over
his
parish
in
an
ancient
pony
carriage
of
peacock
it
was
low
enough
for
him
to
haul
himself
in
and
out
and
he
had
recovered
large
tracts
of
memory
all
apparently
but
the
one
spot
submerged
in
the
catastrophe
that
had
brought
about
his
stroke
he
was
aware
of
events
and
of
their
couplings
and
of
their
sequences
in
time
though
the
origin
of
some
things
was
not
clear
to
him
thus
he
knew
that
alice
was
married
and
living
at
upthorne
though
he
had
forgotten
why
that
she
should
have
married
greatorex
was
a
strange
thing
and
he
could
think
how
it
had
happened
he
supposed
it
must
have
happened
when
he
was
laid
aside
for
he
would
never
have
permitted
it
if
he
had
known
mary
marriage
also
puzzled
him
for
he
had
a
most
distinct
idea
that
it
was
gwenda
who
was
to
have
married
rowcliffe
and
he
said
so
but
he
would
own
humbly
that
he
might
be
mistaken
his
memory
not
being
what
it
was
he
had
settled
more
or
less
into
his
state
of
gentleness
and
submission
broken
from
time
to
time
by
fits
of
violent
irritation
and
relieved
by
pride
pride
in
his
feats
of
independence
his
comings
and
goings
his
washing
his
dressing
and
undressing
of
himself
sometimes
this
pride
was
stubborn
and
insistent
sometimes
it
was
sweet
and
joyous
as
a
child
his
mouth
relaxed
forever
by
his
stroke
had
acquired
a
smile
of
piteous
and
appealing
innocence
it
smiled
upon
the
just
and
upon
the
unjust
it
smiled
even
on
greatorex
whom
socially
he
disapproved
of
he
took
care
to
let
it
be
known
that
he
disapproved
of
greatorex
socially
though
he
tolerated
him
he
tolerated
all
persons
except
one
and
that
one
was
the
ritualistic
curate
grierson
he
had
every
reason
for
not
tolerating
him
not
only
was
grierson
a
ritualist
which
was
only
less
abominable
than
being
a
but
he
had
been
foisted
on
him
without
his
knowledge
or
will
the
vicar
had
simply
waked
up
one
day
out
of
his
confused
twilight
to
a
state
of
fearful
lucidity
and
found
the
young
man
there
worse
than
all
it
was
through
the
third
cartaret
that
he
had
got
there
for
the
vicar
of
greffington
had
applied
to
the
additional
curates
aid
society
for
a
grant
on
behalf
of
his
afflicted
brother
the
vicar
of
garthdale
and
he
had
applied
in
vain
there
was
a
prejudice
against
the
vicar
of
garthdale
but
the
vicar
of
greffington
did
not
relax
his
efforts
he
applied
to
young
rowcliffe
and
young
rowcliffe
applied
to
her
and
not
in
vain
robina
answering
by
return
of
post
offered
to
pay
half
the
curate
salary
rowcliffe
made
himself
responsible
for
the
other
half
robina
in
her
compact
little
house
in
john
wood
had
become
the
prey
of
remorse
her
conscience
had
begun
to
bother
her
by
suggesting
that
she
ought
to
go
back
to
her
husband
now
that
he
was
helpless
and
utterly
inoffensive
she
ought
not
to
leave
him
on
poor
hands
she
ought
at
any
rate
to
take
her
turn
but
robina
could
face
it
she
could
leave
her
compact
little
house
and
go
back
to
her
husband
she
could
even
take
her
turn
flesh
and
blood
shrank
from
the
awful
sacrifice
it
would
be
a
living
death
your
conscience
has
no
business
to
send
you
to
a
living
death
robina
heart
ached
for
poor
gwenda
she
wrote
and
said
so
she
said
she
knew
she
was
a
brute
for
not
going
back
to
gwenda
father
she
would
do
it
if
she
could
but
she
simply
could
she
had
got
the
nerve
and
robina
did
more
she
pulled
wires
and
found
the
curate
that
he
was
a
ritualist
was
no
drawback
in
robina
eyes
in
fact
she
declared
it
was
a
positive
advantage
grierson
practices
would
wake
them
up
in
garthdale
they
needed
waking
she
had
added
that
grierson
was
well
connected
well
behaved
and
extremely
even
charity
could
subdue
the
merry
devil
in
robina
i
ca
see
said
mary
reading
robina
letter
what
good
looks
have
got
to
do
with
it
rowcliffe
face
darkened
he
thought
he
could
see
but
grierson
did
not
wake
garthdale
up
it
opened
one
astonished
eye
on
his
practices
and
turned
over
in
its
sleep
again
grierson
was
young
and
the
village
regarded
all
he
did
as
the
folly
of
his
youth
it
saw
no
harm
in
grierson
not
even
when
he
conceived
a
platonic
passion
for
steven
rowcliffe
and
spent
all
his
spare
time
in
her
and
on
his
way
to
and
from
it
the
curate
lodged
in
the
village
at
the
blenkirons
over
surgery
and
from
that
vantage
ground
he
lay
in
wait
for
rowcliffe
he
watched
his
movements
he
was
ready
at
any
moment
to
fling
open
his
door
and
spring
upon
rowcliffe
with
ardor
and
enthusiasm
it
was
as
if
he
wanted
to
prove
to
him
how
heartily
he
forgave
him
for
being
rowcliffe
husband
there
was
a
robust
innocence
about
him
that
ignored
the
doctor
irony
mary
had
her
own
use
for
grierson
his
handsome
figure
assiduous
but
restrained
the
perfect
image
of
integrity
in
adoration
was
the
very
thing
she
wanted
for
her
she
knew
that
its
presence
there
had
the
effect
of
heightening
her
own
sensual
attraction
it
served
as
a
reminder
to
rowcliffe
that
his
wife
was
a
woman
of
charm
a
fact
which
for
some
time
he
appeared
to
have
forgotten
she
could
play
off
her
adorer
against
her
husband
while
the
candid
purity
of
young
grierson
homage
renewed
her
exquisite
sense
of
her
own
goodness
and
then
the
curate
really
was
a
cousin
of
lord
northfleet
and
rowcliffe
had
calculated
that
to
have
him
in
her
pocket
would
increase
prodigiously
her
social
value
and
it
did
and
rowcliffe
social
value
when
observed
by
grierson
increased
his
adoration
and
when
rowcliffe
told
her
that
young
grierson
platonic
friendship
was
good
for
him
she
made
wide
eyes
at
him
and
said
poor
boy
he
must
have
amusement
she
did
suppose
the
curate
could
be
much
amused
by
calling
at
the
vicarage
young
grierson
had
confided
to
her
that
he
could
make
her
sister
out
i
never
knew
anybody
who
could
she
said
and
gave
him
a
subtle
look
that
disturbed
him
horribly
i
only
meant
he
stammered
and
stopped
for
he
was
quite
sure
what
he
did
mean
his
fair
fresh
face
was
strained
with
the
effort
to
express
himself
he
meditated
you
know
she
really
rather
fascinating
you
ca
help
looking
at
her
only
she
does
seem
to
see
that
you
there
i
suppose
what
puts
you
off
i
know
it
does
dreadfully
said
mary
she
summoned
a
flash
and
let
him
have
it
but
she
magnificent
magnificent
he
echoed
with
his
robust
enthusiasm
but
what
he
thought
was
that
it
was
magnificent
of
rowcliffe
to
praise
her
sister
and
rowcliffe
smiled
grimly
at
young
grierson
and
his
platonic
passion
he
said
to
himself
if
i
only
known
if
i
only
had
the
sense
to
wait
six
months
grierson
would
have
done
just
as
well
for
molly
still
though
grierson
had
come
too
late
he
welcomed
him
and
his
platonic
passion
it
was
good
for
grierson
but
it
was
good
for
molly
at
least
he
supposed
it
was
better
for
her
than
nothing
and
for
him
it
was
infinitely
better
it
kept
grierson
off
gwenda
young
grierson
was
right
when
he
said
that
gwenda
did
see
that
he
was
there
he
had
been
two
years
in
garthdale
and
she
was
as
far
from
seeing
it
as
ever
he
did
mind
he
was
even
amused
by
her
indifference
only
he
could
help
thinking
that
it
was
rather
odd
of
her
considering
that
he
there
the
village
as
simple
in
its
thinking
as
young
grierson
shared
his
view
it
thought
that
it
was
something
more
than
odd
and
it
had
a
suspicion
that
rowcliffe
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
she
be
happy
if
she
did
get
that
young
man
away
from
her
sister
the
village
hinted
that
it
would
be
for
the
first
time
but
in
two
years
with
the
gradual
lifting
of
the
pressure
that
had
numbed
her
gwenda
had
become
aware
not
of
young
grierson
but
of
her
own
tragedy
of
the
slow
life
that
dragged
her
of
its
relentless
motion
and
its
mass
now
that
her
father
need
of
her
was
intermittent
she
was
alive
to
the
tightness
of
the
tie
it
had
been
less
intolerable
when
it
had
bound
her
tighter
when
she
had
had
a
moment
when
it
had
dragged
her
all
the
time
its
slackening
was
torture
she
pulled
then
and
was
jerked
on
her
chain
it
was
not
only
that
rowcliffe
outburst
had
waked
her
and
made
her
cruelly
aware
he
had
timed
it
badly
in
her
moment
of
revived
lucidity
the
moment
when
she
had
become
vulnerable
again
she
was
the
more
sensitive
because
of
her
previous
apathy
as
if
she
had
died
and
was
to
suffering
and
virgin
to
pain
what
hurt
her
most
was
her
father
gentleness
she
could
stand
his
fits
of
irritation
and
obstinacy
they
braced
her
they
called
forth
her
will
but
she
was
defenseless
against
his
pathos
and
he
knew
it
he
had
phrases
that
wrung
her
heart
you
a
good
girl
gwenda
i
only
an
irritable
old
man
my
dear
you
must
mind
what
i
say
she
suffered
from
the
incessant
drain
on
her
pity
for
she
wanted
all
her
will
if
she
was
to
stand
against
rowcliffe
pity
was
a
dangerous
solvent
in
which
her
will
sank
and
was
melted
away
there
were
moments
when
she
saw
herself
as
two
women
one
had
still
the
passion
and
the
memory
of
freedom
the
other
was
a
cowed
and
captive
creature
who
had
forgotten
whose
cramped
motions
guided
her
whose
instinct
of
submission
she
abhorred
her
isolation
was
now
extreme
she
had
had
nothing
to
give
to
any
friends
she
might
have
made
rowcliffe
had
taken
all
that
was
left
of
her
and
now
when
intercourse
was
possible
it
was
they
who
had
withdrawn
they
shared
grierson
inability
to
make
her
out
they
had
heard
rumors
they
imagined
things
they
remembered
also
she
was
the
girl
who
had
raced
all
over
the
country
with
rowcliffe
the
girl
whom
rowcliffe
for
all
their
racing
had
not
cared
to
marry
she
was
the
girl
who
had
run
away
from
home
to
live
with
a
dubious
and
she
was
the
sister
of
that
awful
greatorex
who
well
everybody
knew
what
greatorex
was
gwenda
cartaret
like
her
younger
sister
had
been
talked
about
not
so
much
in
the
big
houses
of
the
dale
the
queer
facts
had
been
tossed
up
and
down
a
smokeroom
for
one
season
and
then
dropped
in
the
big
houses
they
did
remember
gwenda
cartaret
they
only
remembered
to
forget
her
but
in
the
little
shops
and
in
the
little
houses
in
morfe
there
had
been
continual
whispering
they
said
that
even
after
marriage
to
that
nice
wife
of
his
who
was
her
own
sister
the
two
had
been
carrying
on
if
there
was
any
actual
harm
done
and
maybe
there
was
the
doctor
had
been
running
into
danger
he
was
up
at
garthdale
more
than
he
need
be
now
that
the
old
vicar
was
about
again
and
they
had
been
seen
together
the
head
gamekeeper
at
garthdale
had
caught
them
more
than
once
out
on
the
moor
and
after
dark
too
it
was
said
in
the
little
houses
that
it
was
the
doctor
fault
in
the
big
houses
judgment
had
been
more
impartial
but
morfe
was
loyal
to
its
doctor
it
was
hers
every
bit
you
might
depend
on
it
of
rowcliffe
it
was
said
that
maybe
he
been
tempted
but
he
was
a
good
man
was
rowcliffe
and
he
stopped
in
time
because
they
know
what
gwenda
cartaret
was
capable
of
they
believed
like
the
vicar
that
she
was
capable
of
anything
it
was
only
in
her
own
village
that
they
knew
the
head
gamekeeper
had
never
told
his
tale
in
garth
it
would
have
made
him
too
unpopular
gwenda
cartaret
remained
unaware
of
what
was
said
rumor
protected
her
by
cutting
her
off
from
its
own
sources
and
she
had
other
consolations
besides
her
ignorance
so
long
as
she
knew
that
rowcliffe
cared
for
her
and
always
had
cared
it
did
not
seem
to
matter
to
her
so
much
that
he
had
married
mary
she
actually
considered
that
of
the
two
mary
was
the
one
to
be
pitied
it
was
so
infinitely
worse
to
be
married
to
a
man
who
did
care
for
you
than
not
to
be
married
to
a
man
who
did
of
course
there
was
the
tie
her
sister
had
outward
and
visible
possession
of
him
but
she
said
to
herself
i
would
give
what
i
have
for
if
i
ca
have
both
and
of
course
there
was
steven
and
steven
misery
which
was
more
unbearable
to
her
than
her
own
at
least
she
thought
it
was
more
unbearable
she
did
ask
herself
how
bearable
it
would
have
been
if
steven
marriage
had
brought
him
a
satisfaction
that
denied
her
and
cast
her
out
for
she
was
persuaded
that
steven
also
had
his
consolation
he
knew
that
she
cared
for
him
she
conceived
this
knowledge
of
theirs
as
constituting
an
immaterial
and
immutable
possession
of
each
other
and
it
did
not
strike
her
that
this
knowledge
might
be
less
richly
compensating
to
steven
than
to
her
her
woman
passion
forced
inward
sustained
her
with
an
inward
peace
an
inward
exaltation
and
in
this
peace
this
exaltation
it
became
one
with
her
passion
for
the
place
she
was
unaware
of
what
was
happening
in
her
she
did
not
know
that
her
soul
had
joined
the
two
beyond
its
own
power
to
put
asunder
she
still
looked
on
her
joy
in
the
earth
as
a
solitary
emotion
untouched
by
any
other
she
still
said
to
herself
nothing
can
take
this
away
from
me
for
she
had
hours
now
and
again
when
she
shook
off
the
who
held
her
down
in
those
hours
her
inner
life
moved
with
the
large
rhythm
of
the
seasons
and
was
soaked
in
the
dyes
of
the
visible
world
and
the
visible
world
passing
into
her
inner
life
took
on
its
radiance
and
intensity
everything
that
happened
and
that
was
great
and
significant
in
its
happening
happened
there
outside
nothing
happened
nothing
stood
out
nothing
moved
no
procession
of
events
trod
down
or
blurred
her
perfect
impressions
of
the
earth
and
sky
they
eternalised
themselves
in
memory
they
became
her
memory
the
days
were
carved
for
her
in
the
lines
of
the
hills
and
painted
for
her
in
their
colors
days
that
were
dim
green
and
gray
when
the
dreaming
land
was
withdrawn
under
a
veil
so
fine
that
it
had
the
transparency
of
water
or
when
the
stone
walls
the
humble
houses
and
the
high
ramparts
drenched
with
mist
and
with
secret
sunlight
became
insubstantial
days
when
all
the
hills
were
hewn
out
of
one
opal
days
that
had
the
form
of
karva
under
snow
and
the
thin
blues
and
violets
of
the
snow
she
remembered
purely
without
thinking
it
was
in
april
that
i
went
away
from
steven
or
it
was
in
november
that
he
married
mary
or
it
was
in
february
that
we
knew
about
ally
and
father
had
his
stroke
her
nature
was
sound
and
sane
it
refused
to
brood
over
suffering
she
was
not
like
alice
and
in
her
unlikeness
she
lacked
some
of
resources
she
could
fling
herself
on
to
a
polonaise
of
a
sonata
any
more
than
she
could
lie
on
a
couch
all
day
and
look
at
her
own
white
hands
and
dream
her
passion
found
no
outlet
in
creating
violent
and
voluptuous
sounds
it
was
passive
rather
and
attentive
cut
off
from
all
contacts
of
the
flesh
it
turned
to
the
distant
and
the
undreamed
its
very
senses
became
infinitely
subtle
they
discerned
the
hidden
soul
of
the
land
that
had
entranced
her
there
were
no
words
for
this
experience
she
had
no
sense
of
self
in
it
and
needed
none
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
what
she
contemplated
as
if
all
her
senses
were
fused
together
in
the
sense
of
seeing
and
what
her
eyes
saw
they
heard
and
touched
and
felt
but
when
she
came
to
and
saw
herself
seeing
she
said
at
least
this
is
mine
nobody
not
even
steven
can
take
it
away
from
me
she
also
reminded
herself
that
she
had
alice
she
meant
alice
greatorex
alice
cartaret
oppressed
by
her
own
awfulness
had
loved
her
with
a
sullen
selfish
love
the
love
of
a
frustrated
and
unhappy
child
but
there
was
no
awfulness
in
alice
greatorex
in
the
fine
sanity
of
happiness
she
showed
herself
as
good
as
gold
marriage
that
had
made
mary
hard
made
alice
tender
mary
was
wrapped
up
in
her
husband
and
her
house
and
in
her
social
relations
and
young
grierson
platonic
passion
so
tightly
wrapped
that
these
things
formed
round
her
an
impenetrable
shell
they
hid
a
secret
and
inaccessible
mary
alice
was
wrapped
up
in
her
husband
and
children
in
the
boy
of
three
who
was
so
like
gwenda
and
in
the
baby
girl
who
was
so
like
greatorex
but
through
them
she
had
become
approachable
she
had
the
ways
of
some
happy
household
animal
its
quick
rushes
of
affection
and
its
gaze
the
long
spiritual
gaze
of
its
maternity
mysterious
and
appealing
she
loved
gwenda
with
a
remorseful
love
she
said
to
herself
if
i
had
been
so
awful
gwenda
might
have
married
steven
she
saw
the
appalling
extent
of
gwenda
sacrifice
she
saw
it
as
it
was
monstrous
absurd
altogether
futile
it
was
the
futility
of
it
that
troubled
alice
most
even
if
gwenda
had
been
capable
of
sacrificing
herself
for
mary
which
had
been
by
no
means
her
intention
that
would
have
been
futile
too
alice
was
of
rowcliffe
opinion
that
young
grierson
would
have
done
every
bit
as
well
for
mary
better
for
mary
had
no
children
and
how
said
alice
could
she
expect
to
have
them
she
saw
in
mary
childlessness
not
only
god
but
nature
justice
there
were
moments
when
mary
saw
it
too
but
she
left
god
out
of
it
and
called
it
nature
cruelty
if
it
was
not
really
gwenda
for
in
flashes
of
extreme
lucidity
mary
put
it
down
to
rowcliffe
coldness
and
she
had
come
to
know
that
gwenda
was
responsible
for
that
lvi
but
one
day
in
april
in
the
fourth
year
of
her
marriage
mary
sent
for
gwenda
rowcliffe
was
out
on
his
rounds
she
had
thought
of
that
she
was
fond
of
having
gwenda
with
her
in
rowcliffe
absence
when
she
could
talk
to
her
about
him
in
a
way
that
assumed
his
complete
indifference
to
gwenda
and
utter
devotion
to
herself
gwenda
was
used
to
this
habit
of
mary
and
thought
nothing
of
it
she
found
her
in
rowcliffe
study
the
room
that
she
knew
better
than
any
other
in
his
house
the
window
was
closed
the
panes
cut
up
the
colors
of
the
orchard
and
framed
them
in
small
squares
mary
received
her
with
a
gentle
voice
and
a
show
of
tenderness
she
said
very
little
they
had
tea
together
and
when
gwenda
would
have
gone
mary
kept
her
she
still
said
very
little
she
seemed
to
brood
over
some
happy
secret
presently
she
spoke
she
told
her
secret
and
when
she
had
told
it
she
turned
her
eyes
to
gwenda
with
a
look
of
subtle
penetration
and
of
triumph
at
last
she
said
after
three
years
and
she
added
i
knew
you
would
be
glad
i
glad
said
gwenda
she
glad
she
was
determined
to
be
glad
she
looked
glad
and
she
kissed
mary
and
said
again
that
she
was
very
glad
but
as
she
walked
back
the
four
miles
up
garthdale
under
karva
she
felt
an
aching
at
her
heart
which
was
odd
considering
how
glad
she
was
she
said
to
herself
i
be
glad
i
want
mary
to
be
happy
why
should
i
be
glad
it
not
as
if
it
could
make
any
difference
lvii
in
september
mary
sent
for
her
again
mary
was
very
she
lay
on
her
bed
and
rowcliffe
and
her
sister
stood
on
either
side
of
her
she
gazed
from
one
to
the
other
with
eyes
of
terror
and
entreaty
it
was
as
if
she
cried
out
to
them
the
two
who
were
so
strong
to
help
her
she
stretched
out
her
arms
on
the
counterpane
one
arm
toward
each
of
them
her
little
hands
implored
them
each
of
them
laid
a
hand
in
mary
hand
that
closed
on
it
with
a
clutch
of
agony
rowcliffe
had
sat
up
all
night
with
her
his
face
was
white
and
haggard
and
there
was
fear
and
misery
in
his
eyes
they
never
looked
at
gwenda
lest
they
should
see
the
same
fear
and
the
same
misery
there
it
was
as
if
they
had
no
love
for
each
other
only
a
profound
and
secret
pity
that
sprang
in
both
of
them
from
their
fear
only
once
they
found
each
other
outside
on
the
landing
when
they
had
left
mary
alone
with
hyslop
the
old
doctor
from
reyburn
and
the
nurse
each
spoke
once
steven
is
there
really
any
danger
yes
i
wish
to
god
i
had
harker
do
you
mind
sending
him
a
wire
i
must
go
and
see
what
that
fool
hyslop
doing
he
turned
back
again
into
the
room
gwenda
went
out
and
sent
the
wire
but
at
noon
before
harker
could
come
to
them
it
was
over
mary
lay
as
alice
had
lain
weak
and
happy
with
her
child
tucked
in
the
crook
of
her
arm
and
she
smiled
at
it
dreamily
the
old
doctor
and
the
nurse
smiled
at
rowcliffe
it
could
they
said
have
gone
off
more
easily
there
had
been
any
danger
nor
any
earthly
reason
to
have
sent
for
harker
though
of
course
if
it
had
made
rowcliffe
happier
the
old
doctor
added
that
if
it
had
been
anybody
else
wife
rowcliffe
would
have
known
that
it
was
going
all
right
and
in
the
evening
when
her
sister
stood
again
at
her
bedside
as
mary
lifted
the
edge
of
the
flannel
that
hid
her
baby
face
she
looked
at
gwenda
and
smiled
not
dreamily
but
subtly
in
a
triumph
that
was
almost
malign
that
night
gwenda
dreamed
that
she
saw
mary
lying
dead
and
with
a
dead
child
in
the
crook
of
her
arm
she
woke
in
anguish
and
terror
lviii
three
years
passed
and
six
months
the
cartarets
had
been
in
garthdale
nine
years
gwenda
cartaret
sat
in
the
at
the
vicarage
alone
with
her
father
it
was
nearly
ten
of
the
march
evening
they
waited
for
the
striking
of
the
clock
it
would
be
prayer
time
then
and
after
prayers
the
vicar
would
drag
himself
upstairs
to
bed
and
in
the
peace
that
slid
into
the
room
when
he
left
it
gwenda
would
go
on
with
her
reading
she
had
her
sewing
in
her
lap
and
her
book
bergson
propped
open
before
her
on
the
table
she
sewed
as
she
read
for
the
vicar
considered
that
sewing
was
an
occupation
and
that
reading
was
not
he
was
silent
as
long
as
his
daughter
sewed
and
when
she
read
he
talked
toward
ten
his
silence
would
be
broken
by
a
continual
sighing
and
yearning
the
vicar
longed
for
prayer
time
to
come
and
end
his
day
but
he
had
decreed
that
prayer
time
was
ten
and
he
would
not
have
permitted
it
to
come
a
minute
sooner
he
nursed
a
book
on
his
knees
but
he
made
no
pretence
of
reading
it
he
had
taken
off
his
glasses
and
sat
with
his
hands
folded
in
an
attitude
of
utter
resignation
to
his
own
will
in
the
kitchen
essy
gale
sat
by
the
dying
fire
and
waited
for
the
stroke
of
ten
and
as
she
waited
she
stitched
at
the
torn
breeches
of
her
little
son
essy
had
come
back
to
the
house
where
she
had
been
turned
away
for
her
mother
was
wanted
by
greatorex
at
upthorne
and
what
greatorex
wanted
she
got
there
were
two
more
children
now
at
the
farm
and
work
enough
for
three
women
in
the
house
and
essy
with
all
her
pride
had
not
been
too
proud
to
come
back
she
had
no
feeling
but
pity
for
the
old
man
her
master
who
had
bullied
her
and
put
her
to
shame
if
it
pleased
god
to
afflict
him
that
was
god
affair
and
even
as
a
devout
wesleyan
essy
considered
that
god
had
about
done
enough
as
essy
sat
and
stitched
she
smiled
thinking
of
greatorex
son
who
lay
in
her
bed
in
the
little
room
over
the
kitchen
miss
gwenda
let
her
have
him
with
her
on
the
nights
when
gale
slept
up
at
the
farm
it
was
quiet
in
the
vicarage
kitchen
the
door
into
the
back
yard
was
shut
the
door
that
essy
used
to
keep
open
when
she
listened
for
a
footstep
and
a
whisper
that
door
had
betrayed
her
many
a
time
when
the
wind
slammed
it
to
essy
heart
was
quiet
as
the
heart
of
her
sleeping
child
she
had
forgotten
how
madly
it
had
leaped
to
her
lover
footsteps
how
it
had
staggered
at
the
slamming
of
the
door
she
had
forgotten
the
tears
that
she
had
shed
when
alice
wild
music
had
rocked
the
house
and
what
the
vicar
had
said
to
her
that
night
when
she
spilled
the
glass
of
water
in
the
study
but
she
remembered
that
gwenda
had
given
her
son
his
first
little
sunday
suit
and
that
before
jimmy
came
when
essy
was
in
bed
crying
with
the
she
had
knocked
at
her
door
and
said
what
is
it
essy
can
i
do
anything
for
you
she
could
hear
her
saying
it
now
essy
memory
was
like
that
she
had
thought
of
gwenda
just
then
because
she
heard
the
sound
of
rowcliffe
motor
car
tearing
up
the
dale
the
woman
in
the
other
room
heard
it
too
she
had
heard
its
horn
hooting
on
the
moor
road
nearly
a
mile
away
she
raised
her
hand
and
listened
it
hooted
again
once
twice
placably
at
the
turning
of
the
road
under
karva
she
shivered
at
the
sound
it
hooted
irritably
furiously
as
the
car
tore
through
the
village
its
lamps
swung
a
shaft
of
light
over
the
low
garden
wall
at
the
garden
gate
the
car
made
a
shuddering
pause
gwenda
face
and
all
her
body
listened
a
little
unborn
undying
hope
quivered
in
her
heart
always
at
that
pausing
of
the
car
at
her
gate
it
hardly
gave
her
time
for
one
before
she
heard
the
grinding
of
the
gear
as
the
car
took
the
steep
hill
to
upthorne
but
she
was
always
taken
in
by
it
she
had
always
that
insane
hope
that
the
course
of
things
had
changed
and
that
steven
had
really
stopped
at
the
gate
and
was
coming
to
her
it
insanity
for
she
knew
that
rowcliffe
would
never
come
to
see
her
in
the
evening
now
after
his
outburst
more
than
five
years
ago
there
was
no
use
pretending
to
each
other
that
they
were
safe
he
had
told
her
plainly
that
if
she
wanted
him
to
hold
out
he
must
never
be
long
alone
with
her
at
any
time
and
he
must
give
up
coming
to
see
her
late
at
night
it
was
much
too
risky
when
i
can
come
and
see
you
way
he
had
said
it
mean
that
i
left
off
caring
but
i
look
in
every
wednesday
if
i
can
every
wednesday
as
long
as
i
live
he
come
now
and
then
not
on
a
wednesday
but
that
way
he
had
not
been
able
to
help
it
but
he
had
left
longer
and
longer
intervals
between
and
he
had
never
come
that
way
since
last
year
when
his
second
child
was
born
nothing
but
life
or
death
would
bring
rowcliffe
out
in
his
car
after
nightfall
yet
the
thing
had
her
every
time
and
it
was
as
if
her
heart
was
ground
with
the
grinding
and
torn
with
the
tearing
of
the
car
then
she
said
to
herself
i
must
end
it
somehow
it
horrible
to
go
on
caring
like
this
he
was
right
it
would
be
better
not
to
see
him
at
all
and
she
began
counting
the
days
and
the
hours
till
wednesday
when
she
would
see
him
lix
wednesday
was
still
the
vicar
day
for
visiting
his
parish
it
was
also
rowcliffe
day
for
visiting
his
daughter
but
the
vicar
was
not
going
to
change
it
on
that
account
on
wednesday
if
it
was
a
fine
afternoon
she
was
always
sure
of
having
rowcliffe
to
herself
rowcliffe
himself
had
become
the
creature
of
unalterable
habit
she
was
conscious
now
of
the
normal
pulse
of
time
a
steady
pulse
that
beat
with
a
large
rhythm
a
measure
of
seven
days
from
wednesday
to
wednesday
she
filled
the
days
between
with
reading
and
walking
and
parish
work
there
had
been
changes
in
garthdale
grierson
had
got
married
in
one
of
his
bursts
of
enthusiasm
and
had
gone
away
his
place
had
been
taken
by
macey
the
strenuous
son
of
a
durlingham
grocer
macey
had
got
into
the
church
by
sheer
strenuousness
and
had
married
strenuously
a
sharp
and
sallow
wife
between
them
they
left
very
little
parish
work
for
gwenda
she
had
become
a
furious
reader
she
liked
hard
stuff
that
her
brain
could
bite
on
it
fell
on
a
book
and
gutted
it
throwing
away
the
trash
she
read
all
the
modern
poets
and
novelists
she
cared
about
english
and
foreign
they
left
her
stimulated
but
unsatisfied
there
were
not
enough
good
ones
to
keep
her
going
she
worked
through
the
elizabethan
dramatists
and
all
the
vicar
tudor
classics
and
came
on
jowett
translations
of
the
platonic
dialogues
by
the
way
and
was
lured
on
the
quest
of
ultimate
reality
and
found
that
there
was
nothing
like
thought
to
keep
you
from
thinking
she
took
to
metaphysics
as
you
take
to
she
must
have
strong
heavy
stuff
that
drugged
her
brain
and
when
she
found
that
she
could
trust
her
intellect
she
set
it
deliberately
to
fight
her
passion
at
first
it
was
an
even
match
for
gwenda
intellect
like
her
body
was
robust
it
generally
held
its
ground
from
thursday
morning
till
tuesday
night
but
the
night
that
followed
wednesday
afternoon
would
see
its
overthrow
this
wednesday
it
fought
gallantly
till
the
very
moment
of
arrival
she
was
still
reading
bergson
and
her
brain
struggled
to
make
out
the
sense
and
rhythm
of
the
sentences
across
the
beating
of
her
heart
after
seven
years
her
heart
still
beat
at
steven
coming
it
remained
an
excitement
and
adventure
for
she
never
knew
how
he
would
be
sometimes
he
had
a
word
to
say
to
her
and
left
her
miserable
sometimes
after
a
hard
day
work
he
would
be
tired
and
heavy
she
saw
him
and
her
heart
would
ache
for
him
sometimes
he
would
be
young
almost
as
he
used
to
be
she
knew
that
he
was
only
young
for
her
he
was
young
because
he
loved
her
she
had
never
seen
him
so
with
mary
sometimes
he
would
be
formal
and
frigid
he
talked
to
her
as
a
man
talks
to
a
woman
he
is
determined
to
keep
at
a
distance
she
hated
steven
then
as
passion
hates
he
had
come
before
now
in
a
downright
bad
temper
and
was
the
old
irritable
steven
who
found
fault
with
everything
she
said
and
did
and
she
had
loved
him
for
it
as
she
had
loved
the
old
steven
it
was
his
queer
way
of
showing
that
he
loved
her
but
he
had
not
been
like
that
for
a
very
long
time
he
had
grown
gentler
as
he
had
grown
older
he
showed
her
more
than
one
of
his
familiar
moods
she
took
them
gladly
as
so
many
signs
of
his
unchanging
nature
he
still
kept
up
his
way
of
coming
in
the
careful
closing
of
the
door
the
slight
pause
there
by
the
threshold
the
look
that
sought
her
and
that
held
her
for
an
instant
before
their
hands
met
she
saw
it
still
as
the
look
that
pleaded
with
her
while
it
caressed
her
that
said
i
know
we
ought
to
be
so
pleased
to
see
each
other
but
we
ca
help
it
can
we
it
was
the
look
of
his
romantic
youth
as
long
as
she
saw
it
there
it
was
nothing
to
her
that
rowcliffe
had
changed
physically
that
he
moved
more
heavily
that
his
keenness
and
his
slenderness
were
going
that
she
saw
also
a
slight
thickening
of
his
fine
nose
a
perceptible
slackening
of
the
taut
muscles
of
his
mouth
and
a
decided
fulness
about
his
jaw
and
chin
she
saw
all
these
things
but
she
did
not
see
that
his
romantic
youth
lay
dying
in
the
pathos
of
his
eyes
and
that
if
it
pleaded
still
it
pleaded
forgiveness
for
the
sin
of
dying
his
hand
fell
slackly
from
hers
as
she
took
it
it
was
as
if
they
were
still
on
their
guard
still
afraid
of
each
other
touch
as
he
sat
in
the
chair
that
faced
hers
he
held
his
hands
clasped
loosely
in
front
of
him
and
looked
at
them
with
a
curious
attention
as
if
he
wondered
what
kind
of
hands
they
were
that
could
resist
holding
her
when
he
saw
that
she
was
looking
at
him
they
fell
apart
with
a
nervous
gesture
they
picked
up
the
book
she
had
laid
down
and
turned
it
his
eyes
examined
the
title
page
their
pathos
lightened
and
softened
it
became
compassion
they
smiled
at
her
with
a
little
pitiful
smile
half
tender
half
ironic
as
if
they
said
poor
gwenda
is
that
what
you
driven
to
he
opened
the
book
and
turned
the
pages
reading
a
little
here
and
there
he
scowled
his
look
changed
it
darkened
it
was
angry
resentful
inimical
the
dying
youth
in
it
came
a
little
nearer
to
death
rowcliffe
had
found
that
he
could
not
understand
what
he
had
read
huh
what
do
you
addle
your
brains
with
that
stuff
for
he
said
it
amuses
me
oh
so
long
as
you
amused
he
pushed
away
the
book
that
had
offended
him
they
talked
about
the
vicar
about
alice
about
rowcliffe
children
about
the
changes
in
the
dale
the
coming
of
the
maceys
and
the
going
of
young
grierson
he
was
a
bad
chap
grierson
he
softened
remembering
grierson
i
ca
think
why
you
did
care
about
him
and
at
the
thought
of
how
gwenda
might
have
cared
for
grierson
and
had
cared
his
youth
revived
it
came
back
into
his
eyes
and
lit
them
it
passed
into
his
scowling
face
and
caressed
and
smoothed
it
to
the
perfect
look
of
reminiscent
satisfaction
rowcliffe
did
not
know
neither
did
she
how
his
egoism
hung
upon
her
passion
how
it
drew
from
it
food
and
fire
he
raised
his
head
and
squared
his
shoulders
with
the
unconscious
gesture
of
his
male
pride
it
was
then
that
she
saw
for
the
first
time
that
he
wore
the
black
tie
and
had
the
black
band
of
mourning
on
his
sleeve
oh
steven
what
do
you
wear
that
for
this
my
poor
old
uncle
died
last
week
not
the
one
i
saw
when
at
mary
wedding
no
another
one
my
father
brother
he
paused
it
made
a
great
difference
to
me
and
mary
he
said
it
gravely
mournfully
almost
she
looked
at
him
with
tender
eyes
i
sorry
steven
he
smiled
faintly
sorry
are
you
yes
if
you
cared
for
him
i
afraid
i
did
very
much
it
not
as
if
i
seen
a
lot
of
him
you
said
it
made
a
difference
so
it
has
he
left
me
a
good
four
hundred
a
year
oh
sort
of
difference
my
dear
girl
four
hundred
a
year
makes
all
the
difference
it
no
use
pretending
that
it
does
i
not
pretending
you
sounded
sorry
and
i
was
sorry
for
you
that
was
all
at
that
his
egoism
winced
it
was
as
if
she
had
accused
him
of
pretending
to
be
sorry
he
looked
at
her
sharply
his
romantic
youth
died
in
that
look
silence
fell
between
them
but
she
was
used
to
that
she
even
welcomed
it
steven
silences
brought
him
nearer
to
her
than
his
speech
essy
came
in
with
the
he
lingered
uneasily
after
the
meal
glancing
now
and
then
at
the
clock
she
was
used
to
that
too
she
also
had
her
eyes
on
the
clock
measuring
the
priceless
moments
is
anything
worrying
you
steven
she
said
presently
why
do
i
look
worried
not
exactly
but
you
do
look
well
i
getting
a
bit
rusty
that
what
the
matter
with
me
i
want
some
hard
work
to
rub
me
up
and
put
a
polish
on
me
and
i
ca
get
it
here
i
never
had
enough
to
do
since
i
left
leeds
harker
was
a
wise
chap
to
stick
to
it
it
would
do
me
all
the
good
in
the
world
if
i
went
back
then
she
said
you
to
go
steven
she
did
not
know
in
her
isolation
that
rowcliffe
had
been
going
about
saying
that
sort
of
thing
for
the
last
seven
years
she
thought
it
was
the
formidable
discovery
of
time
you
ought
to
go
if
you
feel
like
that
about
it
why
do
you
i
do
know
you
know
she
did
not
look
at
him
as
she
spoke
so
she
missed
his
bewilderment
you
know
why
you
stayed
steven
he
understood
he
remembered
the
dull
red
of
his
face
flushed
with
the
shock
of
the
memory
do
i
he
said
i
made
you
his
flush
darkened
but
he
gave
no
other
sign
of
having
heard
her
i
do
know
why
i
staying
now
he
rose
and
looked
at
his
watch
i
must
be
going
home
he
said
he
turned
at
the
threshold
i
forgot
to
give
you
mary
message
she
sent
her
love
and
she
wants
to
know
when
you
coming
again
to
see
the
babies
oh
some
day
soon
you
must
make
it
very
soon
or
they
wo
be
babies
any
more
dying
to
show
them
to
you
she
showed
them
to
me
the
other
day
she
says
it
ages
since
you
been
and
if
she
says
it
is
she
thinks
it
is
gwenda
was
silent
i
coming
all
right
tell
her
well
but
what
day
we
better
fix
it
do
come
on
a
tuesday
or
a
friday
i
be
out
i
must
come
when
i
can
lx
she
went
on
a
tuesday
she
had
had
tea
with
her
father
first
had
become
sacred
to
the
vicar
and
he
hated
her
to
be
away
for
any
one
of
them
she
walked
the
four
miles
going
across
the
moor
under
karva
and
loitering
by
the
way
and
it
was
past
six
before
she
reached
morfe
she
was
shown
into
the
room
that
was
once
rowcliffe
study
it
had
been
mary
ever
since
last
year
when
the
second
child
was
born
and
they
turned
the
big
room
over
the
into
a
day
nursery
mary
had
made
it
snug
and
gay
with
cushions
and
shining
florid
chintzes
there
were
a
great
many
things
in
rosewood
and
brass
a
piano
took
the
place
of
rowcliffe
writing
table
a
bureau
and
a
cabinet
stood
against
the
wall
where
his
bookcases
had
been
and
a
tall
in
a
pot
filled
the
little
window
that
looked
on
to
the
orchard
she
had
only
to
close
her
eyes
and
shut
out
these
objects
and
she
saw
the
room
as
it
used
to
be
she
closed
them
now
and
instantly
she
opened
them
again
for
the
vision
hurt
her
she
went
restlessly
about
the
room
picking
up
things
and
looking
at
them
without
seeing
them
in
the
room
upstairs
she
heard
the
cries
of
rowcliffe
children
bumping
and
the
scampering
of
feet
she
stood
still
then
and
clenched
her
hands
the
pain
at
her
heart
was
like
no
other
pain
it
was
as
if
she
hated
rowcliffe
children
presently
she
would
have
to
go
up
and
see
them
she
waited
mary
was
taking
her
own
time
upstairs
the
doors
opened
and
shut
on
the
sharp
grief
of
little
children
carried
unwillingly
to
bed
gwenda
heart
melted
and
grew
tender
at
the
sound
but
its
tenderness
was
more
unbearable
to
her
than
its
pain
the
came
to
the
door
rowcliffe
says
will
you
please
go
upstairs
to
the
night
nursery
miss
gwenda
she
ca
leave
the
children
that
was
the
message
mary
invariably
sent
she
left
the
children
for
hours
together
when
other
visitors
were
there
she
could
never
leave
them
for
a
minute
when
her
sister
came
unless
steven
happened
to
be
in
then
mary
would
abandon
whatever
she
was
doing
and
hurry
to
the
two
in
the
last
year
gwenda
had
never
found
herself
alone
with
steven
for
ten
minutes
in
his
house
if
mary
could
come
at
once
she
sent
the
nurse
in
with
the
children
upstairs
in
the
night
nursery
mary
sat
in
the
nurse
low
chair
her
baby
sprawled
naked
in
her
lap
the
elder
infant
stood
whining
under
the
nurse
hands
mary
had
changed
a
little
in
three
and
a
half
years
she
was
broader
and
stouter
the
tender
rose
had
hardened
over
her
high
cheek
bones
her
face
still
kept
its
tranquil
brooding
but
her
slow
gray
eyes
had
a
secret
tremor
they
were
almost
alert
as
if
she
were
on
the
watch
and
mary
mouth
with
its
wide
turned
back
lips
had
lost
its
subtlety
it
had
coarsened
slightly
and
loosened
under
her
continual
content
gwenda
brushed
mary
mouth
lightly
with
the
winged
arch
of
her
upper
lip
mary
laughed
you
do
know
how
to
kiss
she
said
if
you
going
to
treat
baby
that
way
and
molly
too
gwenda
stooped
over
the
soft
red
down
of
the
baby
head
to
gwenda
it
was
as
if
her
heart
kept
her
hands
off
rowcliffe
children
as
if
her
flesh
shrank
from
their
flesh
while
her
lips
brushed
theirs
in
tenderness
and
repulsion
but
seeing
them
was
always
worse
in
anticipation
than
reality
for
there
was
no
trace
of
rowcliffe
in
his
children
the
little
things
were
all
cartaret
molly
the
elder
had
a
look
of
ally
sullen
and
sickly
as
if
some
innermost
reluctance
had
held
back
the
impulse
that
had
given
it
being
even
the
younger
child
showed
fragile
as
if
implacable
memory
had
come
between
it
and
perfect
life
gwenda
did
not
know
why
her
fierceness
was
appeased
by
this
unlikeness
nor
why
she
wanted
to
see
mary
and
nothing
but
mary
in
rowcliffe
children
nor
why
she
refused
to
think
of
them
as
his
she
only
knew
that
to
see
rowcliffe
in
mary
children
would
have
been
more
than
her
flesh
and
blood
could
bear
you
come
just
in
time
to
see
baby
in
her
bath
said
mary
i
seem
to
be
always
in
time
for
that
well
you
not
in
time
to
see
steven
he
wo
be
home
till
nine
at
least
i
did
expect
to
see
him
he
told
me
he
be
out
she
saw
the
hidden
watcher
in
mary
eyes
looking
out
at
her
when
did
he
tell
you
that
last
wednesday
the
watcher
hid
again
suddenly
appeased
mary
busied
herself
with
the
washing
of
her
babies
she
did
it
thoroughly
and
efficiently
with
no
sentimental
tendernesses
but
with
soft
sensual
pattings
and
strokings
of
the
white
skins
and
when
they
were
tucked
into
their
cots
and
disposed
of
for
the
night
mary
turned
to
gwenda
come
into
my
room
a
minute
she
said
mary
joy
was
to
take
her
sister
into
her
room
and
watch
her
to
see
if
she
would
flinch
before
the
signs
of
steven
occupation
she
drew
her
attention
to
these
if
gwenda
seemed
likely
to
miss
any
of
them
we
had
the
beds
turned
she
said
the
light
hurt
steven
eyes
i
ca
say
i
like
sleeping
with
my
head
out
in
the
middle
of
the
room
why
do
you
lie
the
other
way
then
my
dear
steven
would
like
that
oh
what
a
mess
my
hair
in
she
turned
to
the
glass
and
smoothed
her
disordered
waves
and
coils
while
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
gwenda
image
there
appraising
her
clothes
her
slenderness
and
straightness
the
set
of
her
head
on
her
shoulders
the
air
that
she
kept
up
of
almost
insolent
adolescence
she
noted
the
delicate
lines
on
her
forehead
and
at
the
corners
of
her
eyes
she
saw
that
her
small
defiant
face
was
still
white
and
firm
and
that
her
eyes
looked
violet
blue
with
the
dark
shadows
under
them
time
was
the
only
power
that
had
been
good
to
gwenda
she
ought
to
look
more
battered
mary
thought
she
carry
it
off
well
and
she
only
two
years
younger
than
i
am
it
her
figure
really
not
her
face
she
got
more
lines
than
i
have
but
if
i
wore
that
long
straight
coat
i
should
look
awful
in
it
it
all
very
well
for
you
she
said
you
have
had
two
children
no
i
have
but
what
all
very
well
the
good
looks
you
contrive
to
keep
my
dear
nobody
would
know
you
were
should
molly
if
you
did
remind
me
every
time
mary
flushed
you
say
next
that
why
you
do
come
why
i
do
come
yes
it
ages
since
you
been
here
that
was
always
mary
cry
i
have
much
time
molly
for
coming
on
the
the
off
chance
as
if
i
never
asked
you
you
can
go
to
alice
poor
ally
would
have
anybody
to
show
the
baby
to
if
i
did
you
have
seen
one
of
ally
babies
i
ca
gwenda
i
must
think
of
the
children
i
ca
let
them
grow
up
with
little
greatorexes
there
are
three
of
them
are
there
did
you
know
there
been
another
steven
tell
me
she
had
rather
a
bad
time
had
she
she
had
molly
it
would
do
you
any
harm
now
to
go
and
see
her
i
think
it
horrid
of
you
not
to
it
such
rotten
humbug
why
you
used
to
say
was
ten
times
more
awful
than
poor
little
ally
there
are
moments
gwenda
when
i
think
you
are
moments
you
always
did
think
it
you
think
it
still
and
yet
you
have
me
here
but
you
wo
have
her
just
because
she
gone
a
technical
howler
and
i
have
you
have
but
you
have
gone
a
worse
one
if
you
had
the
chance
gwenda
raised
her
head
you
know
molly
that
that
is
true
i
said
if
i
suppose
you
think
you
had
your
chance
then
i
do
think
anything
except
that
i
got
to
go
you
have
you
going
to
stay
for
dinner
now
you
here
i
ca
really
mary
but
mary
was
obstinate
whether
her
sister
stayed
or
went
she
made
it
hard
for
her
she
kept
it
up
on
the
stairs
and
at
the
door
and
at
the
garden
gate
perhaps
you
come
some
night
when
steven
here
you
know
always
glad
to
see
you
the
sting
of
it
was
in
mary
watching
eyes
for
when
you
came
to
think
of
it
there
was
nothing
else
she
could
very
well
have
said
lxi
that
year
when
spring
warmed
into
summer
gwenda
strength
went
from
her
she
was
always
tired
she
fought
with
her
fatigue
and
got
the
better
of
it
but
in
a
week
or
two
it
returned
rowcliffe
told
her
to
rest
and
she
rested
for
a
day
or
two
lying
on
the
couch
in
the
where
ally
used
to
lie
and
when
she
felt
better
she
crawled
out
on
to
the
moor
and
lay
there
one
day
she
said
to
herself
there
ally
i
go
and
see
how
getting
on
she
dragged
herself
up
the
hill
to
upthorne
it
was
a
day
of
heat
and
hidden
sunlight
the
moor
and
the
marshes
were
drenched
in
the
gray
june
mist
the
hillside
wore
soft
vapor
like
a
cloak
hiding
its
nakedness
at
the
top
of
the
three
fields
the
nave
of
the
old
barn
showed
as
if
lifted
up
and
withdrawn
into
the
distance
but
it
was
no
longer
solitary
the
beside
it
had
burst
into
white
flower
it
shimmered
under
the
mist
in
the
dim
green
field
like
a
magic
thing
and
about
to
disappear
remaining
only
for
the
hour
of
its
enchantment
it
gave
her
the
same
subtle
and
mysterious
joy
that
she
had
had
on
the
night
she
and
rowcliffe
walked
together
and
saw
the
on
greffington
edge
white
under
the
hidden
moon
the
gray
was
changed
for
jim
greatorex
had
got
on
he
had
built
himself
another
granary
on
the
north
side
of
the
mistal
he
built
it
long
and
low
of
hewn
stone
with
a
corrugated
iron
roof
and
he
had
made
himself
two
fine
new
rooms
a
and
a
nursery
one
above
the
other
within
the
blind
walls
of
the
house
where
the
old
granary
had
been
the
walls
were
blind
no
longer
for
he
had
knocked
four
large
windows
out
of
them
and
it
was
as
if
of
the
house
were
awake
and
staring
while
the
other
half
in
its
old
and
alien
beauty
dozed
and
dreamed
under
its
scowling
mullions
as
gwenda
came
to
it
she
wondered
how
the
farm
could
ever
have
seemed
sinister
and
it
had
become
so
entirely
the
place
of
happy
life
loud
noises
came
from
the
open
windows
of
the
where
the
family
were
at
tea
the
barking
of
dogs
the
competitive
laughter
of
small
children
a
gurgling
and
crowing
and
spluttering
with
now
and
then
the
sudden
delicate
laughter
of
ally
and
the
bellowing
of
jim
oh
there
gwenda
said
ally
jim
stopped
between
a
bellowing
and
a
choking
for
his
mouth
was
full
ay
it
he
washed
down
his
mouthful
coom
ally
and
open
door
t
but
ally
did
not
come
she
had
her
baby
on
her
knees
and
was
feeding

at
the
door
of
the
old
kitchen
jim
grasped
his

he
jerked
his
thumb
toward
his
and
led
the
way
there
jim
was
not
quite
so
alert
and
slender
as
he
had
been
he
had
lost
his
savage
grace
but
he
moved
with
his
old
directness
and
dignity
and
he
still
looked
at
you
with
his
pathetic
mystic
gaze
ally
was
contrite
she
raised
her
face
to
her
sister
to
be
kissed
i

and
little
steven
and
the
baby
john
they
lifted
little
sticky
faces
and
wiped
them
on
gwenda
face
and
the
happy
din
went
on
ally
did
seem
to
mind
it
she
had
grown
plump
and
pink
and
rather
like
mary
without
her
subtlety
she
sat
smiling
tranquil
among
the
cries
of
her
offspring
jim
turned
three
dogs
out
into
the
yard
by
way
of
discipline
he
and
ally
tried
to
talk
to
each
other
across
the
tumult
that
remained
now
and
then
ally
and
the
children
talked
to
gwenda
they
told
her
that
the
black
and
white
cow
had
calved
and
that
the
blue
lupins
had
come
up
in
the
garden
that
the
old
sow
had
died
that
jenny
the
chintz
cat
had
kittened
and
that
the
rabbit

ally
i
breaakin
in
t
yoong
chestnut

jim

exciting
and
wonderful
to
ally
but

gwenda
i

i

she
was
ally
knew
it
but
she
wanted
perpetual
reassurance
but
you
never
tell
us
anything
there
nothing
to
tell
nothing
happens
oh
come
said
ally
how
papa
much
the
same
except
that
he
drove
into
morfe
yesterday
to
see
molly
yes
darling
of
course
you
may
ally
was
abstracted
for
gwenny
had
slipped
from
her
chair
and
was
whispering
in
her
ear
it
never
occurred
to
ally
to
ask
what
gwenda
had
been
doing
or
what
she
had
been
thinking
of
or
what
she
felt
or
to
listen
to
anything
she
had
to
say
her
sister
might
just
as
well
not
have
existed
for
all
the
interest
ally
showed
in
her
she
had
really
forgotten
what
gwenda
had
done
for
her
but
she
could
go
on
thinking
about
it
forever
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
was
easy
or
agreeable
to
think
about
and
instinct
of
urged
her
to
turn
from
it
she
tended
to
forget
it
as
she
tended
to
forget
all
dreadful
things
such
as
her
own
terrors
and
her
father
illness
and
the
noises
greatorex
made
when
he
was
eating
gwenda
was
used
to
this
apathy
of
ally
and
it
had
never
hurt
her
till
she
wanted
something
from
ally
she
did
know
what
it
was
exactly
but
it
was
something
ally
had
got
she
only
said
have
you
seen
the
on
greffington
edge
and
ally
never
answered
she
was
heading
off
a
stream
of
jam
that
was
creeping
down
stevey
chin
to
plunge
into
his
neck
gwenda
aasskin
yo
yo
seen
t
on
greffington
edge
said
greatorex
he
spoke
to
ally
as
if
she
were
deaf
she
made
a
desperate
effort
to
detach
herself
from
stevey
the
has
anybody
set
fire
to
them
tha
silly
laass
what
about
the
gwenda
only
that
they
all
in
flower
gwenda
said
she
did
know
where
it
had
come
from
the
sudden
impulse
to
tell
ally
about
the
beauty
of
the
but
the
impulse
had
gone
she
thought
sadly
they
want
me
but
they
do
want
me
for
myself
they
do
want
to
talk
to
me
they
know
what
to
say
they
do
know
anything
about
me
they

really
jim

ally

she
went
with
him
he
was
silent
as
they
threaded
the
garden
path
together
she
thought
i
know
why
i
like
him
they
came
to
a
standstill
at
the
south
wall
where
the
tall
blue
lupins
rose
between
them
vivid
in
the
tender
air
and
very
still
greatorex
also
was
still
his
eyes
looked
away
over
the
blue
spires
of
the
lupins
to
the
naked
hillside
they
saw
neither
the
hillside
nor
anything
between
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
thick
almost
as
though
he
were
in
love
or
intoxicated

he
paused
it
coom
t
mae
sence
i
married
ally
she
was
wrong
about
jim
he
had
not
forgotten
her
he
was
not
saying
these
things
for
himself
he
was
saying
them
for
her
getting
them
out
of
himself
with
pain
and
difficulty
it
was
odd
to
think
that
nobody
but
she
understood
jim
and
that
nobody
but
jim
had
ever
really
understood
her
steven
did
understand
her
any
more
than

he
smiled
i
toald
i

my
sawl

he
said
lxii
as
she
went
home
she
tried
to
recapture
the
magic
of
the
flowering
but
it
had
gone
and
she
could
not
be
persuaded
that
it
would
come
again
she
was
still
too
young
to
draw
joy
from
the
memory
of
joy
and
what
greatorex
had
told
her
seemed
incredible
she
said
to
herself
is
it
going
to
be
taken
from
me
like
everything
else
and
a
dreadful
duologue
went
on
in
her
it
looks
like
it
but
it
mine
it
was
mine
like
nothing
else
it
never
had
anything
for
you
but
what
you
gave
it
am
i
to
go
on
giving
the
whole
blessed
time
am
i
never
to
have
anything
for
myself
there
never
is
anything
for
anybody
but
what
they
give
or
what
they
take
from
somebody
else
you
should
have
taken
you
had
your
chance
i
have
died
rather
do
you
call
this
living
i
lived
he
has
why
did
you
sacrifice
him
for
mary
it
was
for
mary
it
was
for
yourself
for
your
own
wretched
soul
for
soul
how
much
do
you
suppose
mary
cares
about
his
soul
it
would
have
had
a
chance
with
you
its
one
chance
the
unconsoling
voice
had
the
last
word
for
it
was
not
in
answer
to
it
that
a
certain
phrase
came
into
her
brooding
mind
i
could
do
a
caddish
thing
like
that
it
puzzled
her
she
had
said
it
to
steven
that
night
but
it
came
to
her
now
attached
to
an
older
memory
somebody
had
said
it
to
her
before
then
years
before
she
remembered
it
was
ally
lxiii
a
year
passed
it
was
june
again
for
more
than
a
year
there
had
been
rumors
of
changes
in
morfe
the
doctor
talked
of
going
he
was
always
talking
of
going
and
nobody
had
yet
believed
that
he
would
go
this
time
they
said
he
was
serious
it
had
been
a
whether
he
stayed
or
went
but
in
the
end
he
stayed
things
had
happened
in
rowcliffe
family
his
mother
had
died
and
his
wife
had
had
a
son
rowcliffe
son
was
the
image
of
rowcliffe
the
doctor
had
no
brothers
or
sisters
and
by
his
mother
death
he
came
into
possession
both
of
his
father
income
and
of
hers
he
had
now
more
than
a
thousand
a
year
over
and
above
what
he
earned
on
an
unearned
thousand
a
year
you
can
live
like
a
rich
man
in
rathdale
not
that
rowcliffe
had
any
idea
of
giving
up
he
was
well
under
forty
and
as
soon
as
old
hyslop
at
reyburn
died
or
retired
he
would
step
into
his
practice
he
had
half
enough
to
do
in
morfe
and
he
wanted
more
meanwhile
he
had
bought
the
house
that
joined
on
to
his
own
and
thrown
the
two
and
their
gardens
into
one
they
had
been
one
twenty
years
ago
when
the
building
with
its
long
rows
of
windows
was
the
dominating
house
in
morfe
village
rowcliffe
was
now
the
dominating
man
in
it
he
had
given
the
old
place
back
its
own
and
he
had
spent
any
amount
of
money
on
it
he
had
had
all
the
woodwork
painted
white
and
the
whole
house
repapered
and
redecorated
he
had
laid
down
parquet
flooring
in
the
big
square
hall
that
he
had
made
and
in
the
new
upstairs
and
he
had
bought
a
great
deal
of
beautiful
and
expensive
furniture
and
now
he
was
building
a
garage
and
laying
out
a
croquet
ground
and
tennis
lawns
at
the
back
he
and
mary
had
been
superintending
these
works
all
afternoon
till
a
shower
sent
them
indoors
and
now
they
were
sitting
together
in
the
in
the
that
came
between
the
hour
and
dinner
mary
had
sent
the
children
back
to
the
nursery
a
little
earlier
than
usual
rowcliffe
had
complained
of
headache
he
was
always
complaining
of
headaches
they
dated
from
his
marriage
and
more
particularly
from
one
night
in
june
eight
years
ago
but
rowcliffe
ignored
the
evidence
of
dates
he
ignored
everything
that
made
him
feel
uncomfortable
he
had
put
gwenda
from
him
he
had
said
plainly
to
mary
in
one
poignant
moment
not
long
before
the
birth
of
their
third
child
if
you
worrying
about
me
and
gwenda
you
need
she
was
never
anything
to
me
that
was
not
saying
there
had
never
been
anything
between
them
but
mary
knew
what
he
had
meant
he
said
to
himself
and
mary
said
that
he
had
got
over
it
but
he
had
got
over
it
he
might
say
to
himself
and
mary
she
was
never
anything
to
me
he
might
put
her
and
the
thought
of
her
away
from
him
but
she
had
left
her
mark
on
him
he
had
put
her
away
she
was
there
in
his
heavy
eyes
and
in
the
irritable
gestures
of
his
hands
in
his
nerves
and
in
his
wounded
memory
she
had
knitted
herself
into
his
secret
being
mary
was
unaware
of
the
cause
of
his
malady
if
it
had
been
suggested
to
her
that
he
had
got
into
this
state
because
of
gwenda
she
would
have
dismissed
the
idea
with
contempt
she
did
worry
about
rowcliffe
state
on
the
contrary
rowcliffe
state
was
a
consolation
and
a
satisfaction
to
her
for
all
that
she
had
endured
through
gwenda
she
would
have
thought
you
mad
if
you
had
told
her
so
for
she
was
sorry
for
steven
and
tender
to
him
when
he
was
nervous
or
depressed
but
to
mary
her
sorrow
and
her
tenderness
were
a
voluptuous
joy
she
even
encouraged
rowcliffe
in
his
state
she
liked
to
make
it
out
worse
than
it
really
was
so
that
he
might
be
more
dependent
on
her
and
she
had
found
that
it
could
be
induced
in
him
by
suggestion
she
had
only
to
say
to
him
steven
you
thoroughly
worn
out
and
he
thoroughly
worn
out
she
had
more
pleasure
because
she
had
more
confidence
in
this
lethargic
rowcliffe
than
in
rowcliffe
young
and
energetic
his
youth
had
attracted
him
to
gwenda
and
his
energy
had
driven
him
out
of
doors
and
mary
had
set
herself
secretly
insidiously
to
destroy
them
it
had
taken
her
seven
years
for
the
first
five
years
it
had
been
hard
work
for
mary
it
had
meant
for
her
body
an
ignominious
waiting
and
watching
for
the
moment
when
its
appeal
would
be
irresistible
for
her
soul
a
complete
subservience
to
her
husband
moods
and
for
her
mind
perpetual
attention
to
his
comfort
a
thousand
cares
that
had
seemed
to
go
unnoticed
but
in
the
sixth
year
they
had
begun
to
tell
once
rowcliffe
had
made
up
his
mind
that
gwenda
could
be
anything
to
him
he
had
let
go
and
through
sheer
exhaustion
had
fallen
more
and
more
into
his
wife
hands
and
for
the
last
two
years
her
labor
had
been
easy
and
its
end
sure
she
had
him
bound
to
her
bed
and
to
her
fireside
he
said
and
thought
that
he
was
happy
he
meant
that
he
was
extremely
comfortable
is
your
head
very
bad
steven
he
shook
his
head
it
was
very
bad
but
he
was
worried
he
was
worried
about
himself
from
time
to
time
his
old
self
rose
against
this
new
self
that
was
the
slave
of
comfort
it
made
desperate
efforts
to
shake
off
the
strangling
lethargy
when
he
went
about
saying
that
he
was
getting
rusty
that
he
ought
never
to
have
left
leeds
and
that
it
would
do
him
all
the
good
in
the
world
to
go
back
there
he
was
saying
what
he
knew
to
be
the
truth
the
life
he
was
leading
was
playing
the
devil
with
his
nerves
and
brain
his
brain
had
nothing
to
do
hard
work
might
not
be
the
cure
for
every
kind
of
nervous
trouble
but
it
was
the
one
cure
for
the
kind
that
he
had
got
he
ought
to
have
gone
away
seven
years
ago
it
was
gwenda
fault
that
he
had
gone
he
felt
a
dull
anger
against
her
as
against
a
woman
who
had
wrecked
his
chance
he
had
a
chance
of
going
now
if
he
cared
to
take
it
he
had
had
a
letter
that
morning
from
harker
asking
if
he
had
meant
what
he
had
said
a
year
ago
and
if
he
care
to
exchange
his
rathdale
practice
for
his
old
practice
in
leeds
harker
wife
was
threatened
with
lung
trouble
and
they
would
have
to
live
in
the
country
somewhere
and
harker
himself
would
be
sorry
for
the
exchange
his
present
practice
was
worth
twice
what
it
had
been
ten
years
ago
and
it
was
growing
there
were
all
sorts
of
interesting
things
to
be
done
in
leeds
by
a
man
of
rowcliffe
keenness
and
energy
do
you
know
steven
you
getting
quite
stout
i
do
know
he
said
almost
with
bitterness
i
do
mean
horridly
stout
dear
just
nicely
and
comfortably
stout
i
comfortable
he
said
i
do
do
enough
work
to
keep
me
fit
is
that
what
bothering
you
he
frowned
it
was
harker
letter
that
was
bothering
him
he
said
so
for
one
instant
mary
looked
impatient
i
thought
we
settled
that
she
said
rowcliffe
sighed
what
on
earth
makes
you
want
to
go
and
leave
this
place
when
spent
hundreds
on
it
i
should
make
pots
of
money
in
leeds
but
we
could
live
there
why
not
it
would
be
too
awful
my
dear
if
it
were
a
big
london
practice
i
should
say
no
that
might
be
worth
while
but
whatever
should
we
have
in
leeds
we
have
much
here
we
got
the
county
you
might
think
of
the
children
i
do
he
said
mournfully
i
do
i
think
of
nothing
else
but
the
children
and
you
if
you
would
like
it
there
an
end
of
it
you
might
think
of
yourself
dear
you
really
are
not
strong
enough
for
it
he
felt
that
he
really
was
not
he
changed
the
subject
i
saw
gwenda
the
other
day
looking
as
young
as
ever
i
suppose
no
not
quite
so
young
i
thought
she
was
looking
rather
he
meditated
i
wonder
why
she
never
comes
he
really
did
wonder
it
a
quarter
past
seven
steven
he
rose
and
stretched
himself
they
went
together
to
the
night
nursery
where
the
three
children
lay
in
their
cots
the
little
girls
awake
and
restless
and
the
baby
in
his
first
sleep
they
bent
over
them
together
mary
lips
touched
the
red
hair
and
the
dark
where
steven
lips
had
been
they
spent
the
evening
sitting
by
the
fire
in
rowcliffe
study
the
doctor
dozed
mary
silent
over
her
sewing
was
the
perfect
image
of
tranquillity
from
time
to
time
she
looked
at
her
husband
and
smiled
as
his
chin
dropped
to
his
breast
and
recovered
itself
with
a
start
at
the
stroke
of
ten
she
murmured
steven
are
you
ready
for
bed
he
rose
stumbling
for
drowsiness
as
they
passed
into
the
square
hall
he
paused
and
looked
round
him
before
putting
out
the
lights
yes
he
yawned
i
think
we
shall
do
very
comfortably
here
for
the
next
seven
years
he
was
thinking
of
old
hyslop
he
had
given
him
seven
years
lxiv
the
next
day
it
was
a
friday
when
mary
came
home
to
tea
after
a
round
of
ineffectual
calling
she
was
told
that
miss
gwenda
was
in
the
mary
inquired
whether
the
doctor
was
in
rowcliffe
was
in
but
he
was
engaged
in
the
surgery
mary
thought
she
knew
why
gwenda
had
come
for
the
last
two
or
three
wednesdays
rowcliffe
had
left
garthdale
without
calling
at
the
vicarage
he
had
not
meant
to
break
his
habit
but
it
happened
so
for
this
year
mary
had
decided
to
have
a
day
from
may
to
october
and
her
day
was
wednesday
her
sister
had
ignored
her
day
and
mary
was
offended
she
had
every
reason
mary
believed
in
keeping
up
appearances
and
the
appearance
she
most
desired
to
keep
up
was
that
of
behaving
beautifully
to
her
sister
this
required
her
sister
it
could
appear
if
gwenda
did
and
gwenda
had
given
it
a
chance
she
meant
to
have
it
out
with
her
she
greeted
her
therefore
with
a
certain
challenge
what
are
you
keeping
away
for
do
you
suppose
we
are
glad
to
see
you
i
not
keeping
away
said
gwenda
it
looks
uncommonly
like
it
do
you
know
it
two
months
since
been
here
is
it
i
lost
count
i
should
think
you
did
lose
count
i
sorry
molly
i
could
come
you
talk
as
if
you
had
engagements
every
day
in
garthdale
if
it
comes
to
that
it
months
since
you
been
to
us
it
different
for
me
i
engagements
and
i
my
husband
and
children
too
steven
hates
it
if
i
out
when
he
comes
home
and
papa
hates
it
if
out
it
no
use
minding
what
papa
hates
what
making
you
so
sensitive
living
with
him
then
for
goodness
sake
get
away
from
him
when
you
can
one
afternoon
here
ca
matter
to
him
gwenda
said
nothing
neither
did
she
look
at
her
but
she
answered
her
in
her
heart
it
matters
to
it
matters
to
how
stupid
you
are
if
you
do
see
how
it
matters
yet
i
die
rather
than
you
should
see
mary
went
on
exasperated
by
her
sister
silence
we
may
as
well
have
it
out
while
we
about
it
why
ca
you
look
me
straight
in
the
face
and
say
plump
out
what
i
done
you
done
nothing
well
is
it
steven
then
has
he
done
anything
of
course
he
has
what
he
do
poor
steven
goodness
knows
i
sure
i
do
no
more
does
he
unless
she
stopped
her
sister
was
looking
her
straight
in
the
face
now
unless
what
my
dear
gwenda
do
glare
at
me
like
that
i
not
saying
things
and
i
not
thinking
them
i
do
know
what
thinking
if
you
were
so
nervy
you
own
that
i
always
been
decent
to
you
sure
i
been
i
always
stood
up
for
you
i
always
wanted
to
have
you
here
and
why
should
you
mary
blinked
she
had
seen
her
blunder
i
never
said
you
were
decent
to
me
molly
you
behave
as
if
i
were
how
am
i
to
behave
i
know
it
difficult
said
mary
the
memory
of
her
blunder
rankled
are
you
offended
because
steven
has
been
to
see
you
my
molly
mary
ignored
her
look
of
weary
tolerance
because
you
ca
expect
him
to
keep
on
running
up
to
garthdale
when
papa
all
right
i
do
expect
him
well
then
said
mary
with
the
air
of
having
exhausted
all
plausible
interpretations
if
i
were
offended
said
gwenda
should
i
be
here
the
appearance
of
the
and
the
parlormaid
absolved
mary
from
the
embarrassing
compulsion
to
reply
she
addressed
herself
to
the
parlormaid
tell
rowcliffe
that
tea
is
ready
and
that
miss
gwendolen
is
here
she
really
wanted
steven
to
come
and
deliver
her
from
the
situation
she
had
created
but
rowcliffe
delayed
his
coming
is
it
true
that
steven
going
to
give
up
his
practice
gwenda
said
presently
well
no
whatever
he
does
he
wo
do
that
said
mary
she
thought
so
that
what
she
came
for
steven
has
told
her
anything
what
put
that
idea
into
your
head
she
asked
somebody
told
me
so
he
had
an
offer
of
harker
practice
in
leeds
and
some
idea
of
taking
it
he
seemed
to
think
it
might
be
a
good
thing
there
was
a
flicker
in
the
whiteness
of
gwenda
face
it
arrested
mary
it
was
not
excitement
nor
dismay
nor
eagerness
nor
even
interest
it
was
a
sort
of
illumination
the
movement
of
some
inner
light
the
shining
passage
of
some
idea
and
in
gwenda
attitude
as
it
now
presented
itself
to
mary
there
was
a
curious
still
withdrawal
and
detachment
she
seemed
hardly
to
listen
but
to
be
preoccupied
with
her
idea
he
thought
it
would
be
a
good
thing
she
said
i
think
i
convinced
him
said
mary
that
it
would
gwenda
was
stiller
and
more
withdrawn
than
ever
guarding
her
idea
can
i
see
steven
before
i
go
she
said
presently
of
course
he
be
up
in
a
second
i
ca
here
mary
stared
she
understood
you
poor
dear
you
shall
see
him
this
minute
she
rang
the
bell
lxv
five
minutes
passed
before
rowcliffe
came
to
gwenda
in
the
study
forgive
me
he
said
i
had
a
troublesome
patient
do
be
afraid
you
not
going
to
have
another
come
have
troubled
me
much
anyhow
this
is
the
first
time
is
it
yes
she
thought
it
was
the
first
time
and
it
would
be
the
last
there
had
not
been
many
ways
of
seeing
steven
but
this
way
had
always
been
open
to
her
if
she
had
cared
to
take
it
but
it
had
been
of
all
ways
the
most
repugnant
to
her
and
she
had
never
taken
it
till
now
when
she
was
driven
to
it
mary
tells
me
you
not
feeling
very
fit
he
was
utterly
gentle
as
he
was
with
all
sick
and
suffering
things
i
all
right
that
not
why
i
want
to
see
you
he
was
faintly
surprised
what
is
it
then
sit
down
and
tell
me
she
sat
down
they
had
steven
table
as
a
barrier
between
them
you
been
thinking
of
leaving
rathdale
have
you
she
said
i
been
thinking
of
leaving
it
for
the
last
seven
years
but
i
have
left
it
yet
i
do
suppose
i
shall
leave
it
now
even
when
you
got
the
chance
even
when
i
got
the
chance
you
said
you
wanted
to
go
and
you
do
do
you
well
yes
for
some
things
would
you
think
me
an
awful
brute
if
i
said
i
wanted
you
to
go
he
gave
her
a
little
queer
puzzled
look
i
would
think
you
a
brute
whatever
you
wanted
do
you
mind
my
smoking
a
cigarette
no
she
waited
steven
i
wish
i
had
made
you
stay
you
not
making
me
stay
i
mean
that
time
do
you
remember
he
smiled
a
little
smile
of
reminiscent
tenderness
yes
yes
i
remember
i
did
understand
steven
well
well
there
no
need
to
go
back
on
that
now
it
done
gwenda
yes
and
i
did
it
i
would
have
done
it
if
i
known
what
it
meant
i
did
think
it
would
have
been
like
this
like
what
rowcliffe
smile
that
had
been
reminiscent
was
now
vague
and
obscurely
speculative
i
ought
to
have
let
you
go
when
you
wanted
to
she
said
rowcliffe
looked
down
at
the
table
she
sat
leaning
sideways
against
it
one
thin
arm
was
stretched
out
on
it
the
hand
gripped
the
paper
weight
that
he
had
pushed
away
it
was
this
hand
so
tense
and
yet
so
helpless
that
he
was
looking
at
he
laid
his
own
over
it
gently
its
grip
slackened
then
it
lay
lax
under
the
sheltering
hand
do
worry
about
that
my
dear
he
said
it
been
all
right
it
has
it
has
rowcliffe
nerves
winced
before
her
fierce
intensity
he
withdrew
his
sheltering
hand
just
at
first
she
said
it
was
all
right
but
you
see
it
broken
down
you
said
it
would
you
must
keep
on
bothering
about
what
i
said
it
is
what
you
said
it
what
is
it
this
place
we
all
tied
up
together
in
it
tight
we
ca
get
away
from
each
other
it
as
if
i
could
leave
i
stuck
here
with
papa
my
dear
gwenda
did
i
ever
say
you
ought
to
leave
no
you
said
ought
it
the
same
thing
it
is
and
i
do
say
it
now
what
is
the
earthly
use
of
going
back
on
things
that
what
makes
you
ill
put
it
straight
out
of
your
mind
you
know
i
ca
help
you
if
you
go
on
like
this
you
can
my
dear
i
wish
i
knew
how
you
asked
me
to
stay
and
i
stayed
i
can
understand
if
i
asked
you
to
go
would
you
go
steven
would
you
understand
that
too
my
dear
child
what
good
would
that
do
you
i
want
you
to
go
steven
you
want
me
to
go
he
screwed
up
his
eyes
as
if
he
were
trying
to
see
the
thing
clearly
yes
she
said
he
shook
his
head
he
had
given
it
up
no
my
dear
you
do
want
me
to
go
you
only
think
you
do
you
do
know
what
you
want
i
should
say
it
if
i
did
would
you
it
exactly
what
you
would
say
do
you
suppose
i
know
you
she
had
both
her
arms
stretched
before
him
on
the
table
now
the
hands
were
clasped
the
little
thin
hands
implored
him
her
eyes
implored
him
in
the
tense
clasp
and
in
the
gaze
there
was
the
passion
of
entreaty
that
she
kept
out
of
her
voice
but
rowcliffe
did
not
see
it
he
had
shifted
his
position
sinking
a
little
lower
into
his
chair
and
his
head
was
bowed
before
her
his
eyes
somberly
reflective
looked
straight
in
front
of
him
under
their
bent
brows
he
seemed
to
be
really
considering
whether
he
would
go
or
stay
no
he
said
presently
no
i
not
going
but
he
was
dubious
and
deliberate
it
was
as
if
he
still
weighed
it
still
watched
for
the
turning
of
the
scale
the
clock
across
the
struck
eight
he
gathered
himself
together
and
it
was
then
as
if
the
strokes
falling
on
his
ear
set
free
some
blocked
movement
in
his
brain
no
he
said
i
do
see
how
i
can
go
as
things
are
besides
it
is
necessary
i
see
she
said
she
rose
she
gave
him
a
long

mortally
wounded
as
to
be
unaware
that
it
was
hurt
but
at
the
turn
of
the

road
her
heart
stirred
in

with
the
wind
that

the

of

in

her
fear

crouched

its
huddled
houses
naked
