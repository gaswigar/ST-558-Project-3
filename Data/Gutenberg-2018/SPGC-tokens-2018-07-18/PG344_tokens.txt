it
was
a
beautiful
morning
in
the
late
july
when
i
set
forth
on
foot
for
the
last
time
for
aros
a
boat
had
put
me
ashore
the
night
before
at
grisapol
i
had
such
breakfast
as
the
little
inn
afforded
and
leaving
all
my
baggage
till
i
had
an
occasion
to
come
round
for
it
by
sea
struck
right
across
the
promontory
with
a
cheerful
heart
i
was
far
from
being
a
native
of
these
parts
springing
as
i
did
from
an
unmixed
lowland
stock
but
an
uncle
of
mine
gordon
darnaway
after
a
poor
rough
youth
and
some
years
at
sea
had
married
a
young
wife
in
the
islands
mary
maclean
she
was
called
the
last
of
her
family
and
when
she
died
in
giving
birth
to
a
daughter
aros
the
farm
had
remained
in
his
possession
it
brought
him
in
nothing
but
the
means
of
life
as
i
was
well
aware
but
he
was
a
man
whom
had
pursued
he
feared
cumbered
as
he
was
with
the
young
child
to
make
a
fresh
adventure
upon
life
and
remained
in
aros
biting
his
nails
at
destiny
years
passed
over
his
head
in
that
isolation
and
brought
neither
help
nor
contentment
meantime
our
family
was
dying
out
in
the
lowlands
there
is
little
luck
for
any
of
that
race
and
perhaps
my
father
was
the
luckiest
of
all
for
not
only
was
he
one
of
the
last
to
die
but
he
left
a
son
to
his
name
and
a
little
money
to
support
it
i
was
a
student
of
edinburgh
university
living
well
enough
at
my
own
charges
but
without
kith
or
kin
when
some
news
of
me
found
its
way
to
uncle
gordon
on
the
ross
of
grisapol
and
he
as
he
was
a
man
who
held
blood
thicker
than
water
wrote
to
me
the
day
he
heard
of
my
existence
and
taught
me
to
count
aros
as
my
home
thus
it
was
that
i
came
to
spend
my
vacations
in
that
part
of
the
country
so
far
from
all
society
and
comfort
between
the
codfish
and
the
moorcocks
and
thus
it
was
that
now
when
i
had
done
with
my
classes
i
was
returning
thither
with
so
light
a
heart
that
july
day
the
ross
as
we
call
it
is
a
promontory
neither
wide
nor
high
but
as
rough
as
god
made
it
to
this
day
the
deep
sea
on
either
hand
of
it
full
of
rugged
isles
and
reefs
most
perilous
to
seamen
all
overlooked
from
the
eastward
by
some
very
high
cliffs
and
the
great
peals
of
ben
kyaw
mountain
of
the
they
say
the
words
signify
in
the
gaelic
tongue
and
it
is
well
named
for
that
which
is
more
than
three
thousand
feet
in
height
catches
all
the
clouds
that
come
blowing
from
the
seaward
and
indeed
i
used
often
to
think
that
it
must
make
them
for
itself
since
when
all
heaven
was
clear
to
the
sea
level
there
would
ever
be
a
streamer
on
ben
kyaw
it
brought
water
too
and
was
mossy
to
the
top
in
consequence
i
have
seen
us
sitting
in
broad
sunshine
on
the
ross
and
the
rain
falling
black
like
crape
upon
the
mountain
but
the
wetness
of
it
made
it
often
appear
more
beautiful
to
my
eyes
for
when
the
sun
struck
upon
the
hill
sides
there
were
many
wet
rocks
and
watercourses
that
shone
like
jewels
even
as
far
as
aros
fifteen
miles
away
the
road
that
i
followed
was
a
it
twisted
so
as
nearly
to
double
the
length
of
my
journey
it
went
over
rough
boulders
so
that
a
man
had
to
leap
from
one
to
another
and
through
soft
bottoms
where
the
moss
came
nearly
to
the
knee
there
was
no
cultivation
anywhere
and
not
one
house
in
the
ten
miles
from
grisapol
to
aros
houses
of
course
there
were
three
at
least
but
they
lay
so
far
on
the
one
side
or
the
other
that
no
stranger
could
have
found
them
from
the
track
a
large
part
of
the
ross
is
covered
with
big
granite
rocks
some
of
them
larger
than
a
house
one
beside
another
with
fern
and
deep
heather
in
between
them
where
the
vipers
breed
anyway
the
wind
was
it
was
always
sea
air
as
salt
as
on
a
ship
the
gulls
were
as
free
as
moorfowl
over
all
the
ross
and
whenever
the
way
rose
a
little
your
eye
would
kindle
with
the
brightness
of
the
sea
from
the
very
midst
of
the
land
on
a
day
of
wind
and
a
high
spring
i
have
heard
the
roost
roaring
like
a
battle
where
it
runs
by
aros
and
the
great
and
fearful
voices
of
the
breakers
that
we
call
the
merry
men
aros
itself
aros
jay
i
have
heard
the
natives
call
it
and
they
say
it
means
house
of
aros
itself
was
not
properly
a
piece
of
the
ross
nor
was
it
quite
an
islet
it
formed
the
corner
of
the
land
fitted
close
to
it
and
was
in
one
place
only
separated
from
the
coast
by
a
little
gut
of
the
sea
not
forty
feet
across
the
narrowest
when
the
tide
was
full
this
was
clear
and
still
like
a
pool
on
a
land
river
only
there
was
a
difference
in
the
weeds
and
fishes
and
the
water
itself
was
green
instead
of
brown
but
when
the
tide
went
out
in
the
bottom
of
the
ebb
there
was
a
day
or
two
in
every
month
when
you
could
pass
dryshod
from
aros
to
the
mainland
there
was
some
good
pasture
where
my
uncle
fed
the
sheep
he
lived
on
perhaps
the
feed
was
better
because
the
ground
rose
higher
on
the
islet
than
the
main
level
of
the
ross
but
this
i
am
not
skilled
enough
to
settle
the
house
was
a
good
one
for
that
country
two
storeys
high
it
looked
westward
over
a
bay
with
a
pier
hard
by
for
a
boat
and
from
the
door
you
could
watch
the
vapours
blowing
on
ben
kyaw
on
all
this
part
of
the
coast
and
especially
near
aros
these
great
granite
rocks
that
i
have
spoken
of
go
down
together
in
troops
into
the
sea
like
cattle
on
a
summer
day
there
they
stand
for
all
the
world
like
their
neighbours
ashore
only
the
salt
water
sobbing
between
them
instead
of
the
quiet
earth
and
clots
of
blooming
on
their
sides
instead
of
heather
and
the
great
sea
conger
to
wreathe
about
the
base
of
them
instead
of
the
poisonous
viper
of
the
land
on
calm
days
you
can
go
wandering
between
them
in
a
boat
for
hours
echoes
following
you
about
the
labyrinth
but
when
the
sea
is
up
heaven
help
the
man
that
hears
that
cauldron
boiling
off
the
end
of
aros
these
blocks
are
very
many
and
much
greater
in
size
indeed
they
must
grow
monstrously
bigger
out
to
sea
for
there
must
be
ten
sea
miles
of
open
water
sown
with
them
as
thick
as
a
country
place
with
houses
some
standing
thirty
feet
above
the
tides
some
covered
but
all
perilous
to
ships
so
that
on
a
clear
westerly
blowing
day
i
have
counted
from
the
top
of
aros
the
great
rollers
breaking
white
and
heavy
over
as
many
as
buried
reefs
but
it
is
nearer
in
shore
that
the
danger
is
worst
for
the
tide
here
running
like
a
mill
race
makes
a
long
belt
of
broken
water
a
we
call
it
at
the
tail
of
the
land
i
have
often
been
out
there
in
a
dead
calm
at
the
slack
of
the
tide
and
a
strange
place
it
is
with
the
sea
swirling
and
combing
up
and
boiling
like
the
cauldrons
of
a
linn
and
now
and
again
a
little
dancing
mutter
of
sound
as
though
the
were
talking
to
itself
but
when
the
tide
begins
to
run
again
and
above
all
in
heavy
weather
there
is
no
man
could
take
a
boat
within
half
a
mile
of
it
nor
a
ship
afloat
that
could
either
steer
or
live
in
such
a
place
you
can
hear
the
roaring
of
it
six
miles
away
at
the
seaward
end
there
comes
the
strongest
of
the
bubble
and
it
here
that
these
big
breakers
dance
together
the
dance
of
death
it
may
be
called
that
have
got
the
name
in
these
parts
of
the
merry
men
i
have
heard
it
said
that
they
run
fifty
feet
high
but
that
must
be
the
green
water
only
for
the
spray
runs
twice
as
high
as
that
whether
they
got
the
name
from
their
movements
which
are
swift
and
antic
or
from
the
shouting
they
make
about
the
turn
of
the
tide
so
that
all
aros
shakes
with
it
is
more
than
i
can
tell
the
truth
is
that
in
a
wind
that
part
of
our
archipelago
is
no
better
than
a
trap
if
a
ship
got
through
the
reefs
and
weathered
the
merry
men
it
would
be
to
come
ashore
on
the
south
coast
of
aros
in
sandag
bay
where
so
many
dismal
things
befell
our
family
as
i
propose
to
tell
the
thought
of
all
these
dangers
in
the
place
i
knew
so
long
makes
me
particularly
welcome
the
works
now
going
forward
to
set
lights
upon
the
headlands
and
buoys
along
the
channels
of
our
inhospitable
islands
the
country
people
had
many
a
story
about
aros
as
i
used
to
hear
from
my
uncle
man
rorie
an
old
servant
of
the
macleans
who
had
transferred
his
services
without
afterthought
on
the
occasion
of
the
marriage
there
was
some
tale
of
an
unlucky
creature
a
that
dwelt
and
did
business
in
some
fearful
manner
of
his
own
among
the
boiling
breakers
of
the
roost
a
mermaid
had
once
met
a
piper
on
sandag
beach
and
there
sang
to
him
a
long
bright
midsummer
night
so
that
in
the
morning
he
was
found
stricken
crazy
and
from
thenceforward
till
the
day
he
died
said
only
one
form
of
words
what
they
were
in
the
original
gaelic
i
can
not
tell
but
they
were
thus
translated
the
sweet
singing
out
of
the
sea
seals
that
haunted
on
that
coast
have
been
known
to
speak
to
man
in
his
own
tongue
presaging
great
disasters
it
was
here
that
a
certain
saint
first
landed
on
his
voyage
out
of
ireland
to
convert
the
hebrideans
and
indeed
i
think
he
had
some
claim
to
be
called
saint
for
with
the
boats
of
that
past
age
to
make
so
rough
a
passage
and
land
on
such
a
ticklish
coast
was
surely
not
far
short
of
the
miraculous
it
was
to
him
or
to
some
of
his
monkish
underlings
who
had
a
cell
there
that
the
islet
owes
its
holy
and
beautiful
name
the
house
of
god
among
these
old
wives
stories
there
was
one
which
i
was
inclined
to
hear
with
more
credulity
as
i
was
told
in
that
tempest
which
scattered
the
ships
of
the
invincible
armada
over
all
the
north
and
west
of
scotland
one
great
vessel
came
ashore
on
aros
and
before
the
eyes
of
some
solitary
people
on
a
went
down
in
a
moment
with
all
hands
her
colours
flying
even
as
she
sank
there
was
some
likelihood
in
this
tale
for
another
of
that
fleet
lay
sunk
on
the
north
side
twenty
miles
from
grisapol
it
was
told
i
thought
with
more
detail
and
gravity
than
its
companion
stories
and
there
was
one
particularity
which
went
far
to
convince
me
of
its
truth
the
name
that
is
of
the
ship
was
still
remembered
and
sounded
in
my
ears
spanishly
the
they
called
it
a
great
ship
of
many
decks
of
guns
laden
with
treasure
and
grandees
of
spain
and
fierce
soldadoes
that
now
lay
fathom
deep
to
all
eternity
done
with
her
wars
and
voyages
in
sandag
bay
upon
the
west
of
aros
no
more
salvos
of
ordnance
for
that
tall
ship
the
spirit
no
more
fair
winds
or
happy
ventures
only
to
rot
there
deep
in
the
and
hear
the
shoutings
of
the
merry
men
as
the
tide
ran
high
about
the
island
it
was
a
strange
thought
to
me
first
and
last
and
only
grew
stranger
as
i
learned
the
more
of
spain
from
which
she
had
set
sail
with
so
proud
a
company
and
king
philip
the
wealthy
king
that
sent
her
on
that
voyage
and
now
i
must
tell
you
as
i
walked
from
grisapol
that
day
the
was
very
much
in
my
reflections
i
had
been
favourably
remarked
by
our
then
principal
in
edinburgh
college
that
famous
writer
robertson
and
by
him
had
been
set
to
work
on
some
papers
of
an
ancient
date
to
rearrange
and
sift
of
what
was
worthless
and
in
one
of
these
to
my
great
wonder
i
found
a
note
of
this
very
ship
the
with
her
captain
name
and
how
she
carried
a
great
part
of
the
spaniard
treasure
and
had
been
lost
upon
the
ross
of
grisapol
but
in
what
particular
spot
the
wild
tribes
of
that
place
and
period
would
give
no
information
to
the
king
inquiries
putting
one
thing
with
another
and
taking
our
island
tradition
together
with
this
note
of
old
king
jamie
perquisitions
after
wealth
it
had
come
strongly
on
my
mind
that
the
spot
for
which
he
sought
in
vain
could
be
no
other
than
the
small
bay
of
sandag
on
my
uncle
land
and
being
a
fellow
of
a
mechanical
turn
i
had
ever
since
been
plotting
how
to
weigh
that
good
ship
up
again
with
all
her
ingots
ounces
and
doubloons
and
bring
back
our
house
of
darnaway
to
its
dignity
and
wealth
this
was
a
design
of
which
i
soon
had
reason
to
repent
my
mind
was
sharply
turned
on
different
reflections
and
since
i
became
the
witness
of
a
strange
judgment
of
god
the
thought
of
dead
men
treasures
has
been
intolerable
to
my
conscience
but
even
at
that
time
i
must
acquit
myself
of
sordid
greed
for
if
i
desired
riches
it
was
not
for
their
own
sake
but
for
the
sake
of
a
person
who
was
dear
to
my
heart
my
daughter
mary
ellen
she
had
been
educated
well
and
had
been
a
time
to
school
upon
the
mainland
which
poor
girl
she
would
have
been
happier
without
for
aros
was
no
place
for
her
with
old
rorie
the
servant
and
her
father
who
was
one
of
the
unhappiest
men
in
scotland
plainly
bred
up
in
a
country
place
among
cameronians
long
a
skipper
sailing
out
of
the
clyde
about
the
islands
and
now
with
infinite
discontent
managing
his
sheep
and
a
little
shore
fishing
for
the
necessary
bread
if
it
was
sometimes
weariful
to
me
who
was
there
but
a
month
or
two
you
may
fancy
what
it
was
to
her
who
dwelt
in
that
same
desert
all
the
year
round
with
the
sheep
and
flying
and
the
merry
men
singing
and
dancing
in
the
roost
chapter
ii
what
the
wreck
had
brought
to
aros
it
was
when
i
got
the
length
of
aros
and
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
stand
on
the
far
shore
and
whistle
for
rorie
with
the
boat
i
had
no
need
to
repeat
the
signal
at
the
first
sound
mary
was
at
the
door
flying
a
handkerchief
by
way
of
answer
and
the
old
was
shambling
down
the
gravel
to
the
pier
for
all
his
hurry
it
took
him
a
long
while
to
pull
across
the
bay
and
i
observed
him
several
times
to
pause
go
into
the
stern
and
look
over
curiously
into
the
wake
as
he
came
nearer
he
seemed
to
me
aged
and
haggard
and
i
thought
he
avoided
my
eye
the
coble
had
been
repaired
with
two
new
thwarts
and
several
patches
of
some
rare
and
beautiful
foreign
wood
the
name
of
it
unknown
to
me
rorie
said
i
as
we
began
the
return
voyage
is
fine
wood
how
came
you
by
that
will
be
hard
to
cheesel
rorie
opined
reluctantly
and
just
then
dropping
the
oars
he
made
another
of
those
dives
into
the
stern
which
i
had
remarked
as
he
came
across
to
fetch
me
and
leaning
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
stared
with
an
awful
look
into
the
waters
of
the
bay
is
wrong
i
asked
a
good
deal
startled
will
be
a
great
feesh
said
the
old
man
returning
to
his
oars
and
nothing
more
could
i
get
out
of
him
but
strange
glances
and
an
ominous
nodding
of
the
head
in
spite
of
myself
i
was
infected
with
a
measure
of
uneasiness
i
turned
also
and
studied
the
wake
the
water
was
still
and
transparent
but
out
here
in
the
middle
of
the
bay
exceeding
deep
for
some
time
i
could
see
naught
but
at
last
it
did
seem
to
me
as
if
something
dark
a
great
fish
or
perhaps
only
a
shadow
followed
studiously
in
the
track
of
the
moving
coble
and
then
i
remembered
one
of
rorie
superstitions
how
in
a
ferry
in
morven
in
some
great
exterminating
feud
among
the
clans
a
fish
the
like
of
it
unknown
in
all
our
waters
followed
for
some
years
the
passage
of
the
until
no
man
dared
to
make
the
crossing
will
be
waiting
for
the
right
man
said
rorie
mary
met
me
on
the
beach
and
led
me
up
the
brae
and
into
the
house
of
aros
outside
and
inside
there
were
many
changes
the
garden
was
fenced
with
the
same
wood
that
i
had
noted
in
the
boat
there
were
chairs
in
the
kitchen
covered
with
strange
brocade
curtains
of
brocade
hung
from
the
window
a
clock
stood
silent
on
the
dresser
a
lamp
of
brass
was
swinging
from
the
roof
the
table
was
set
for
dinner
with
the
finest
of
linen
and
silver
and
all
these
new
riches
were
displayed
in
the
plain
old
kitchen
that
i
knew
so
well
with
the
settle
and
the
stools
and
the
closet
bed
for
rorie
with
the
wide
chimney
the
sun
shone
into
and
the
peats
with
the
pipes
on
the
mantelshelf
and
the
cornered
spittoons
filled
with
instead
of
sand
on
the
floor
with
the
bare
stone
walls
and
the
bare
wooden
floor
and
the
three
patchwork
rugs
that
were
of
yore
its
sole
adornment
poor
patchwork
the
like
of
it
unknown
in
cities
woven
with
homespun
and
sunday
black
and
polished
on
the
bench
of
rowing
the
room
like
the
house
had
been
a
sort
of
wonder
in
that
it
was
so
neat
and
habitable
and
to
see
it
now
shamed
by
these
incongruous
additions
filled
me
with
indignation
and
a
kind
of
anger
in
view
of
the
errand
i
had
come
upon
to
aros
the
feeling
was
baseless
and
unjust
but
it
burned
high
at
the
first
moment
in
my
heart
girl
said
i
is
the
place
i
had
learned
to
call
my
home
and
i
do
not
know
it
is
my
home
by
nature
not
by
the
learning
she
replied
place
i
was
born
and
the
place
i
like
to
die
in
and
i
neither
like
these
changes
nor
the
way
they
came
nor
that
which
came
with
them
i
would
have
liked
better
under
god
pleasure
they
had
gone
down
into
the
sea
and
the
merry
men
were
dancing
on
them
now
mary
was
always
serious
it
was
perhaps
the
only
trait
that
she
shared
with
her
father
but
the
tone
with
which
she
uttered
these
words
was
even
graver
than
of
custom
said
i
feared
it
came
by
wreck
and
that
by
death
yet
when
my
father
died
i
took
his
goods
without
remorse
father
died
a
clean
strae
death
as
the
folk
say
said
mary
i
returned
a
wreck
is
like
a
judgment
what
was
she
called
ca
her
the
said
a
voice
behind
me
and
turning
round
i
saw
my
uncle
standing
in
the
doorway
he
was
a
sour
small
bilious
man
with
a
long
face
and
very
dark
eyes
years
old
sound
and
active
in
body
and
with
an
air
somewhat
between
that
of
a
shepherd
and
that
of
a
man
following
the
sea
he
never
laughed
that
i
heard
read
long
at
the
bible
prayed
much
like
the
cameronians
he
had
been
brought
up
among
and
indeed
in
many
ways
used
to
remind
me
of
one
of
the
in
the
killing
times
before
the
revolution
but
he
never
got
much
comfort
nor
even
as
i
used
to
think
much
guidance
by
his
piety
he
had
his
black
fits
when
he
was
afraid
of
hell
but
he
had
led
a
rough
life
to
which
he
would
look
back
with
envy
and
was
still
a
rough
cold
gloomy
man
as
he
came
in
at
the
door
out
of
the
sunlight
with
his
bonnet
on
his
head
and
a
pipe
hanging
in
his
he
seemed
like
rorie
to
have
grown
older
and
paler
the
lines
were
deeplier
ploughed
upon
his
face
and
the
whites
of
his
eyes
were
yellow
like
old
stained
ivory
or
the
bones
of
the
dead
he
repeated
dwelling
upon
the
first
part
of
the
word
it
an
awfu
name
i
made
him
my
salutations
and
complimented
him
upon
his
look
of
health
for
i
feared
he
had
perhaps
been
in
the
body
he
replied
ungraciously
enough
in
the
body
and
the
sins
of
the
body
like
yoursel
denner
he
said
abruptly
to
mary
and
then
ran
on
to
me
grand
braws
thir
that
we
hae
gotten
are
they
no
yon
a
bonny
knock
but
it
no
gang
and
the
by
ordnar
bonny
bairnly
braws
it
for
the
like
o
them
folk
sells
the
peace
of
god
that
passeth
understanding
it
for
the
like
o
them
an
maybe
no
even
sae
muckle
worth
folk
daunton
god
to
his
face
and
burn
in
muckle
hell
and
it
for
that
reason
the
scripture
ca
them
as
i
read
the
passage
the
accursed
thing
mary
ye
girzie
he
interrupted
himself
to
cry
with
some
asperity
for
hae
ye
no
put
out
the
twa
candlesticks
should
we
need
them
at
high
noon
she
asked
but
my
uncle
was
not
to
be
turned
from
his
idea
bruik
them
while
we
may
he
said
and
so
two
massive
candlesticks
of
wrought
silver
were
added
to
the
table
equipage
already
so
unsuited
to
that
rough
side
farm
cam
ashore
februar
about
ten
at
nicht
he
went
on
to
me
was
nae
wind
and
a
sair
run
o
sea
and
she
was
in
the
sook
the
roost
as
i
jaloose
we
had
seen
her
a
day
rorie
and
me
beating
to
the
wind
she
wasnae
a
handy
craft
i
thinking
that
for
she
would
neither
steer
nor
stey
wi
them
a
sair
day
they
had
of
it
their
hands
was
never
aff
the
sheets
and
it
perishin
cauld
ower
cauld
to
snaw
and
aye
they
would
get
a
bit
nip
o
wind
and
awa
again
to
pit
the
hope
into
them
eh
man
but
they
had
a
sair
day
for
the
last
he
would
have
had
a
prood
prood
heart
that
won
ashore
upon
the
back
o
that
were
all
lost
i
cried
held
them
he
said
sternly
shall
pray
for
the
deid
on
my
stane
i
disclaimed
a
popish
sense
for
my
ejaculation
and
he
seemed
to
accept
my
disclaimer
with
unusual
facility
and
ran
on
once
more
upon
what
had
evidently
become
a
favourite
subject
fand
her
in
sandag
bay
rorie
an
me
and
a
thae
braws
in
the
inside
of
her
there
a
kittle
bit
ye
see
about
sandag
whiles
the
sook
rins
strong
for
the
merry
men
an
whiles
again
when
the
tide
makin
hard
an
ye
can
hear
the
roost
blawin
at
the
of
aros
there
comes
a
of
current
straucht
into
sandag
bay
weel
there
the
thing
that
got
the
grip
on
the
she
but
to
have
come
in
an
stern
forrit
for
the
bows
of
her
are
aften
under
and
the
of
her
is
clear
at
o
neaps
but
man
the
dunt
that
she
cam
doon
wi
when
she
struck
lord
save
us
a
but
it
an
unco
life
to
be
a
sailor
a
cauld
wanchancy
life
mony
the
gliff
i
got
mysel
in
the
great
deep
and
why
the
lord
should
hae
made
yon
unco
water
is
mair
than
ever
i
could
win
to
understand
he
made
the
vales
and
the
pastures
the
bonny
green
yaird
the
halesome
canty
land
and
now
they
shout
and
sing
to
thee
for
thou
hast
made
them
glad
as
the
psalms
say
in
the
metrical
version
no
that
i
would
preen
my
faith
to
that
clink
neither
but
it
bonny
and
easier
to
mind
who
go
to
sea
in
ships
they
again
and
in
great
waters
trading
be
within
the
deep
these
men
god
works
and
his
great
wonders
see
weel
it
easy
sayin
sae
maybe
dauvit
wasnae
very
weel
acquant
the
sea
but
troth
if
it
wasnae
prentit
in
the
bible
i
wad
whiles
be
to
think
it
wasnae
the
lord
but
the
muckle
black
deil
that
made
the
sea
there
naething
good
comes
oot
but
the
fish
an
the
spentacle
o
god
riding
on
the
tempest
to
be
shure
whilk
would
be
what
dauvit
was
likely
ettling
at
but
man
they
were
sair
wonders
that
god
showed
to
the
wonders
do
i
ca
them
judgments
rather
judgments
in
the
mirk
nicht
among
the
draygons
o
the
deep
and
their
souls
to
think
o
that
their
souls
man
maybe
no
prepared
the
sea
a
muckle
yett
to
hell
i
observed
as
my
uncle
spoke
that
his
voice
was
unnaturally
moved
and
his
manner
unwontedly
demonstrative
he
leaned
forward
at
these
last
words
for
example
and
touched
me
on
the
knee
with
his
spread
fingers
looking
up
into
my
face
with
a
certain
pallor
and
i
could
see
that
his
eyes
shone
with
a
fire
and
that
the
lines
about
his
mouth
were
drawn
and
tremulous
even
the
entrance
of
rorie
and
the
beginning
of
our
meal
did
not
detach
him
from
his
train
of
thought
beyond
a
moment
he
condescended
indeed
to
ask
me
some
questions
as
to
my
success
at
college
but
i
thought
it
was
with
half
his
mind
and
even
in
his
extempore
grace
which
was
as
usual
long
and
wandering
i
could
find
the
trace
of
his
preoccupation
praying
as
he
did
that
god
would
in
mercy
fower
puir
feckless
fiddling
sinful
creatures
here
by
their
beside
the
great
and
dowie
waters
soon
there
came
an
interchange
of
speeches
between
him
and
rorie
it
there
asked
my
uncle
ay
said
rorie
i
observed
that
they
both
spoke
in
a
manner
of
aside
and
with
some
show
of
embarrassment
and
that
mary
herself
appeared
to
colour
and
looked
down
on
her
plate
partly
to
show
my
knowledge
and
so
relieve
the
party
from
an
awkward
strain
partly
because
i
was
curious
i
pursued
the
subject
mean
the
fish
i
asked
fish
cried
my
uncle
quo
he
fish
your
een
are
o
fatness
man
your
heid
dozened
wi
carnal
leir
fish
it
a
bogle
he
spoke
with
great
vehemence
as
though
angry
and
perhaps
i
was
not
very
willing
to
be
put
down
so
shortly
for
young
men
are
disputatious
at
least
i
remember
i
retorted
hotly
crying
out
upon
childish
superstitions
ye
come
frae
the
college
sneered
uncle
gordon
kens
what
they
learn
folk
there
it
no
muckle
service
onyway
do
ye

that
there

a
said

syne
when

callant
in

south
country
i

there
was
an
auld
bald
bogle
in

a

he
cried
horror
the
horror
o
the
sea
we
were
all
somewhat
staggered
by
this
outburst
and
the
speaker
himself
after
that
last
hoarse
apostrophe
appeared
to
sink
gloomily
into
his
own
thoughts
but
rorie
who
was
greedy
of
superstitious
lore
recalled
him
to
the
subject
by
a
question

not
ever

mermaids
and
that
had
come
ashore
upon

islands
and
attacked
the
crews
of
boats
upon
the
sea
and
my
uncle
in
spite
of
his
incredulity
listened
with
uneasy
interest
aweel
he
said
may
be
sae
i
may
be
wrang
but
i
find
nae
word
o
mermen
in
the
scriptures
you
will
find
nae
word
of
aros
roost
maybe
objected
rorie
and
his
argument
appeared
to
carry
weight
when
dinner
was
over
my
uncle
carried
me
forth
with
him
to
a
bank
behind
the
house
it
was
a
very
hot
and
quiet
afternoon
scarce
a
ripple
anywhere
upon
the
sea
nor
any
voice
but
the
familiar
voice
of
sheep
and
gulls
and
perhaps
in
consequence
of
this
repose
in
nature
my
kinsman
showed
himself
more
rational
and
tranquil
than
before
he
spoke
evenly
and
almost
cheerfully
of
my
career
with
every
now
and
then
a
reference
to
the
lost
ship
or
the
treasures
it
had
brought
to
aros
for
my
part
i
listened
to
him
in
a
sort
of
trance
gazing
with
all
my
heart
on
that
remembered
scene
and
drinking
gladly
the
and
the
smoke
of
peats
that
had
been
lit
by
mary
perhaps
an
hour
had
passed
when
my
uncle
who
had
all
the
while
been
covertly
gazing
on
the
surface
of
the
little
bay
rose
to
his
feet
and
bade
me
follow
his
example
now
i
should
say
that
the
great
run
of
tide
at
the
end
of
aros
exercises
a
perturbing
influence
round
all
the
coast
in
sandag
bay
to
the
south
a
strong
current
runs
at
certain
periods
of
the
flood
and
ebb
respectively
but
in
this
northern
bay
aros
bay
as
it
is
called
where
the
house
stands
and
on
which
my
uncle
was
now
gazing
the
only
sign
of
disturbance
is
towards
the
end
of
the
ebb
and
even
then
it
is
too
slight
to
be
remarkable
when
there
is
any
swell
nothing
can
be
seen
at
all
but
when
it
is
calm
as
it
often
is
there
appear
certain
strange
undecipherable
marks
as
we
may
name
them
on
the
glassy
surface
of
the
bay
the
like
is
common
in
a
thousand
places
on
the
coast
and
many
a
boy
must
have
amused
himself
as
i
did
seeking
to
read
in
them
some
reference
to
himself
or
those
he
loved
it
was
to
these
marks
that
my
uncle
now
directed
my
attention
struggling
as
he
did
so
with
an
evident
reluctance
ye
see
yon
scart
upo
the
water
he
inquired
ane
wast
the
gray
stane
ay
weel
it
no
be
like
a
letter
wull
it
it
is
i
replied
have
often
remarked
it
it
is
like
a
he
heaved
a
sigh
as
if
heavily
disappointed
with
my
answer
and
then
added
below
his
breath
for
the
used
to
suppose
sir
it
was
for
myself
said
i
my
name
is
charles
so
ye
afore
he
ran
on
not
heeding
my
remark
weel
but
that
unco
strange
maybe
it
been
there
waitin
as
a
man
wad
say
through
a
the
weary
ages
man
but
that
awfu
and
then
breaking
off
no
see
anither
will
ye
he
asked
said
i
see
another
very
plainly
near
the
ross
side
where
the
road
comes
down
an
m
he
repeated
very
low
and
then
again
after
another
pause
what
wad
ye
make
o
that
he
inquired
had
always
thought
it
to
mean
mary
sir
i
answered
growing
somewhat
red
convinced
as
i
was
in
my
own
mind
that
i
was
on
the
threshold
of
a
decisive
explanation
but
we
were
each
following
his
own
train
of
thought
to
the
exclusion
of
the
other
my
uncle
once
more
paid
no
attention
to
my
words
only
hung
his
head
and
held
his
peace
and
i
might
have
been
led
to
fancy
that
he
had
not
heard
me
if
his
next
speech
had
not
contained
a
kind
of
echo
from
my
own
would
say
naething
o
thae
clavers
to
mary
he
observed
and
began
to
walk
forward
there
is
a
belt
of
turf
along
the
side
of
aros
bay
where
walking
is
easy
and
it
was
along
this
that
i
silently
followed
my
silent
kinsman
i
was
perhaps
a
little
disappointed
at
having
lost
so
good
an
opportunity
to
declare
my
love
but
i
was
at
the
same
time
far
more
deeply
exercised
at
the
change
that
had
befallen
my
uncle
he
was
never
an
ordinary
never
in
the
strict
sense
an
amiable
man
but
there
was
nothing
in
even
the
worst
that
i
had
known
of
him
before
to
prepare
me
for
so
strange
a
transformation
it
was
impossible
to
close
the
eyes
against
one
fact
that
he
had
as
the
saying
goes
something
on
his
mind
and
as
i
mentally
ran
over
the
different
words
which
might
be
represented
by
the
letter
m
misery
mercy
marriage
money
and
the
like
i
was
arrested
with
a
sort
of
start
by
the
word
murder
i
was
still
considering
the
ugly
sound
and
fatal
meaning
of
the
word
when
the
direction
of
our
walk
brought
us
to
a
point
from
which
a
view
was
to
be
had
to
either
side
back
towards
aros
bay
and
homestead
and
forward
on
the
ocean
dotted
to
the
north
with
isles
and
lying
to
the
southward
blue
and
open
to
the
sky
there
my
guide
came
to
a
halt
and
stood
staring
for
awhile
on
that
expanse
then
he
turned
to
me
and
laid
a
hand
on
my
arm
think
there
naething
there
he
said
pointing
with
his
pipe
and
then
cried
out
aloud
with
a
kind
of
exultation
tell
ye
man
the
deid
are
down
there
thick
like
rattons
he
turned
at
once
and
without
another
word
we
retraced
our
steps
to
the
house
of
aros
i
was
eager
to
be
alone
with
mary
yet
it
was
not
till
after
supper
and
then
but
for
a
short
while
that
i
could
have
a
word
with
her
i
lost
no
time
beating
about
the
bush
but
spoke
out
plainly
what
was
on
my
mind
i
said
have
not
come
to
aros
without
a
hope
if
that
should
prove
well
founded
we
may
all
leave
and
go
somewhere
else
secure
of
daily
bread
and
comfort
secure
perhaps
of
something
far
beyond
that
which
it
would
seem
extravagant
in
me
to
promise
but
there
a
hope
that
lies
nearer
to
my
heart
than
money
and
at
that
i
paused
can
guess
fine
what
that
is
mary
i
said
she
looked
away
from
me
in
silence
and
that
was
small
encouragement
but
i
was
not
to
be
put
off
my
days
i
have
thought
the
world
of
you
i
continued
time
goes
on
and
i
think
always
the
more
of
you
i
could
not
think
to
be
happy
or
hearty
in
my
life
without
you
you
are
the
apple
of
my
eye
still
she
looked
away
and
said
never
a
word
but
i
thought
i
saw
that
her
hands
shook
i
cried
in
fear
ye
no
like
me
charlie
man
she
said
this
a
time
to
speak
of
it
let
me
be
a
while
let
me
be
the
way
i
am
it
not
be
you
that
loses
by
the
waiting
i
made
out
by
her
voice
that
she
was
nearly
weeping
and
this
put
me
out
of
any
thought
but
to
compose
her
ellen
i
said
no
more
i
did
not
come
to
trouble
you
your
way
shall
be
mine
and
your
time
too
and
you
have
told
me
all
i
wanted
only
just
this
one
thing
more
what
ails
you
she
owned
it
was
her
father
but
would
enter
into
no
particulars
only
shook
her
head
and
said
he
was
not
well
and
not
like
himself
and
it
was
a
great
pity
she
knew
nothing
of
the
wreck
havenae
been
near
it
said
she
for
would
i
go
near
it
charlie
lad
the
poor
souls
are
gone
to
their
account
long
syne
and
i
would
just
have
wished
they
had
their
gear
with
them
poor
souls
this
was
scarcely
any
great
encouragement
for
me
to
tell
her
of
the
yet
i
did
so
and
at
the
very
first
word
she
cried
out
in
surprise
was
a
man
at
grisapol
she
said
the
month
of
may
a
little
yellow
body
they
tell
me
with
gold
rings
upon
his
fingers
and
a
beard
and
he
was
speiring
high
and
low
for
that
same
ship
it
was
towards
the
end
of
april
that
i
had
been
given
these
papers
to
sort
out
by
robertson
and
it
came
suddenly
back
upon
my
mind
that
they
were
thus
prepared
for
a
spanish
historian
or
a
man
calling
himself
such
who
had
come
with
high
recommendations
to
the
principal
on
a
mission
of
inquiry
as
to
the
dispersion
of
the
great
armada
putting
one
thing
with
another
i
fancied
that
the
visitor
the
gold
rings
upon
his
fingers
might
be
the
same
with
robertson
historian
from
madrid
if
that
were
so
he
would
be
more
likely
after
treasure
for
himself
than
information
for
a
learned
society
i
made
up
my
mind
i
should
lose
no
time
over
my
undertaking
and
if
the
ship
lay
sunk
in
sandag
bay
as
perhaps
both
he
and
i
supposed
it
should
not
be
for
the
advantage
of
this
ringed
adventurer
but
for
mary
and
myself
and
for
the
good
old
honest
kindly
family
of
the
darnaways
chapter
iii
land
and
sea
in
sandag
bay
i
was
early
afoot
next
morning
and
as
soon
as
i
had
a
bite
to
eat
set
forth
upon
a
tour
of
exploration
something
in
my
heart
distinctly
told
me
that
i
should
find
the
ship
of
the
armada
and
although
i
did
not
give
way
entirely
to
such
hopeful
thoughts
i
was
still
very
light
in
spirits
and
walked
upon
air
aros
is
a
very
rough
islet
its
surface
strewn
with
great
rocks
and
shaggy
with
fernland
heather
and
my
way
lay
almost
north
and
south
across
the
highest
knoll
and
though
the
whole
distance
was
inside
of
two
miles
it
took
more
time
and
exertion
than
four
upon
a
level
road
upon
the
summit
i
paused
although
not
very
high
not
three
hundred
feet
as
i
think
it
yet
outtops
all
the
neighbouring
lowlands
of
the
ross
and
commands
a
great
view
of
sea
and
islands
the
sun
which
had
been
up
some
time
was
already
hot
upon
my
neck
the
air
was
listless
and
thundery
although
purely
clear
away
over
the
where
the
isles
lie
thickliest
congregated
some
small
and
ragged
clouds
hung
together
in
a
covey
and
the
head
of
ben
kyaw
wore
not
merely
a
few
streamers
but
a
solid
hood
of
vapour
there
was
a
threat
in
the
weather
the
sea
it
is
true
was
smooth
like
glass
even
the
roost
was
but
a
seam
on
that
wide
mirror
and
the
merry
men
no
more
than
caps
of
foam
but
to
my
eye
and
ear
so
long
familiar
with
these
places
the
sea
also
seemed
to
lie
uneasily
a
sound
of
it
like
a
long
sigh
mounted
to
me
where
i
stood
and
quiet
as
it
was
the
roost
itself
appeared
to
be
revolving
mischief
for
i
ought
to
say
that
all
we
dwellers
in
these
parts
attributed
if
not
prescience
at
least
a
quality
of
warning
to
that
strange
and
dangerous
creature
of
the
tides
i
hurried
on
then
with
the
greater
speed
and
had
soon
descended
the
slope
of
aros
to
the
part
that
we
call
sandag
bay
it
is
a
pretty
large
piece
of
water
compared
with
the
size
of
the
isle
well
sheltered
from
all
but
the
prevailing
wind
sandy
and
shoal
and
bounded
by
low
to
the
west
but
to
the
eastward
lying
several
fathoms
deep
along
a
ledge
of
rocks
it
is
upon
that
side
that
at
a
certain
time
each
flood
the
current
mentioned
by
my
uncle
sets
so
strong
into
the
bay
a
little
later
when
the
roost
begins
to
work
higher
an
undertow
runs
still
more
strongly
in
the
reverse
direction
and
it
is
the
action
of
this
last
as
i
suppose
that
has
scoured
that
part
so
deep
nothing
is
to
be
seen
out
of
sandag
bay
but
one
small
segment
of
the
horizon
and
in
heavy
weather
the
breakers
flying
high
over
a
deep
sea
reef
from
down
the
hill
i
had
perceived
the
wreck
of
february
last
a
brig
of
considerable
tonnage
lying
with
her
back
broken
high
and
dry
on
the
east
corner
of
the
sands
and
i
was
making
directly
towards
it
and
already
almost
on
the
margin
of
the
turf
when
my
eyes
were
suddenly
arrested
by
a
spot
cleared
of
fern
and
heather
and
marked
by
one
of
those
long
low
and
almost
mounds
that
we
see
so
commonly
in
graveyards
i
stopped
like
a
man
shot
nothing
had
been
said
to
me
of
any
dead
man
or
interment
on
the
island
rorie
mary
and
my
uncle
had
all
equally
held
their
peace
of
her
at
least
i
was
certain
that
she
must
be
ignorant
and
yet
here
before
my
eyes
was
proof
indubitable
of
the
fact
here
was
a
grave
and
i
had
to
ask
myself
with
a
chill
what
manner
of
man
lay
there
in
his
last
sleep
awaiting
the
signal
of
the
lord
in
that
solitary
my
mind
supplied
no
answer
but
what
i
feared
to
entertain
shipwrecked
at
least
he
must
have
been
perhaps
like
the
old
armada
mariners
from
some
far
and
rich
land
or
perhaps
one
of
my
own
race
perishing
within
eyesight
of
the
smoke
of
home
i
stood
awhile
uncovered
by
his
side
and
i
could
have
desired
that
it
had
lain
in
our
religion
to
put
up
some
prayer
for
that
unhappy
stranger
or
in
the
old
classic
way
outwardly
to
honour
his
misfortune
i
knew
although
his
bones
lay
there
a
part
of
aros
till
the
trumpet
sounded
his
imperishable
soul
was
forth
and
far
away
among
the
raptures
of
the
everlasting
sabbath
or
the
pangs
of
hell
and
yet
my
mind
misgave
me
even
with
a
fear
that
perhaps
he
was
near
me
where
i
stood
guarding
his
sepulchre
and
lingering
on
the
scene
of
his
unhappy
fate
certainly
it
was
with
a
spirit
somewhat
that
i
turned
away
from
the
grave
to
the
hardly
less
melancholy
spectacle
of
the
wreck
her
stem
was
above
the
first
arc
of
the
flood
she
was
broken
in
two
a
little
abaft
the
foremast
though
indeed
she
had
none
both
masts
having
broken
short
in
her
disaster
and
as
the
pitch
of
the
beach
was
very
sharp
and
sudden
and
the
bows
lay
many
feet
below
the
stern
the
fracture
gaped
widely
open
and
you
could
see
right
through
her
poor
hull
upon
the
farther
side
her
name
was
much
defaced
and
i
could
not
make
out
clearly
whether
she
was
called
after
the
norwegian
city
or
after
the
good
woman
christian
wife
in
that
old
book
the
progress
by
her
build
she
was
a
foreign
ship
but
i
was
not
certain
of
her
nationality
she
had
been
painted
green
but
the
colour
was
faded
and
weathered
and
the
paint
peeling
off
in
strips
the
wreck
of
the
mainmast
lay
alongside
half
buried
in
sand
she
was
a
forlorn
sight
indeed
and
i
could
not
look
without
emotion
at
the
bits
of
rope
that
still
hung
about
her
so
often
handled
of
yore
by
shouting
seamen
or
the
little
scuttle
where
they
had
passed
up
and
down
to
their
affairs
or
that
poor
noseless
angel
of
a
that
had
dipped
into
so
many
running
billows
i
do
not
know
whether
it
came
most
from
the
ship
or
from
the
grave
but
i
fell
into
some
melancholy
scruples
as
i
stood
there
leaning
with
one
hand
against
the
battered
timbers
the
homelessness
of
men
and
even
of
inanimate
vessels
cast
away
upon
strange
shores
came
strongly
in
upon
my
mind
to
make
a
profit
of
such
pitiful
misadventures
seemed
an
unmanly
and
a
sordid
act
and
i
began
to
think
of
my
then
quest
as
of
something
sacrilegious
in
its
nature
but
when
i
remembered
mary
i
took
heart
again
my
uncle
would
never
consent
to
an
imprudent
marriage
nor
would
she
as
i
was
persuaded
wed
without
his
full
approval
it
behoved
me
then
to
be
up
and
doing
for
my
wife
and
i
thought
with
a
laugh
how
long
it
was
since
that
great
the
had
left
her
bones
in
sandag
bay
and
how
weak
it
would
be
to
consider
rights
so
long
extinguished
and
misfortunes
so
long
forgotten
in
the
process
of
time
i
had
my
theory
of
where
to
seek
for
her
remains
the
set
of
the
current
and
the
soundings
both
pointed
to
the
east
side
of
the
bay
under
the
ledge
of
rocks
if
she
had
been
lost
in
sandag
bay
and
if
after
these
centuries
any
portion
of
her
held
together
it
was
there
that
i
should
find
it
the
water
deepens
as
i
have
said
with
great
rapidity
and
even
close
the
rocks
several
fathoms
may
be
found
as
i
walked
upon
the
edge
i
could
see
far
and
wide
over
the
sandy
bottom
of
the
bay
the
sun
shone
clear
and
green
and
steady
in
the
deeps
the
bay
seemed
rather
like
a
great
transparent
crystal
as
one
sees
them
in
a
lapidary
shop
there
was
naught
to
show
that
it
was
water
but
an
internal
trembling
a
hovering
within
of
and
netted
shadows
and
now
and
then
a
faint
lap
and
a
dying
bubble
round
the
edge
the
shadows
of
the
rocks
lay
out
for
some
distance
at
their
feet
so
that
my
own
shadow
moving
pausing
and
stooping
on
the
top
of
that
reached
sometimes
half
across
the
bay
it
was
above
all
in
this
belt
of
shadows
that
i
hunted
for
the
since
it
was
there
the
undertow
ran
strongest
whether
in
or
out
cool
as
the
whole
water
seemed
this
broiling
day
it
looked
in
that
part
yet
cooler
and
had
a
mysterious
invitation
for
the
eyes
peer
as
i
pleased
however
i
could
see
nothing
but
a
few
fishes
or
a
bush
of
and
here
and
there
a
lump
of
rock
that
had
fallen
from
above
and
now
lay
separate
on
the
sandy
floor
twice
did
i
pass
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
rocks
and
in
the
whole
distance
i
could
see
nothing
of
the
wreck
nor
any
place
but
one
where
it
was
possible
for
it
to
be
this
was
a
large
terrace
in
five
fathoms
of
water
raised
off
the
surface
of
the
sand
to
a
considerable
height
and
looking
from
above
like
a
mere
outgrowth
of
the
rocks
on
which
i
walked
it
was
one
mass
of
great
like
a
grove
which
prevented
me
judging
of
its
nature
but
in
shape
and
size
it
bore
some
likeness
to
a
vessel
hull
at
least
it
was
my
best
chance
if
the
lay
not
there
under
the
tangles
it
lay
nowhere
at
all
in
sandag
bay
and
i
prepared
to
put
the
question
to
the
proof
once
and
for
all
and
either
go
back
to
aros
a
rich
man
or
cured
for
ever
of
my
dreams
of
wealth
i
stripped
to
the
skin
and
stood
on
the
extreme
margin
with
my
hands
clasped
irresolute
the
bay
at
that
time
was
utterly
quiet
there
was
no
sound
but
from
a
school
of
porpoises
somewhere
out
of
sight
behind
the
point
yet
a
certain
fear
withheld
me
on
the
threshold
of
my
venture
sad
scraps
of
my
uncle
superstitions
thoughts
of
the
dead
of
the
grave
of
the
old
broken
ships
drifted
through
my
mind
but
the
strong
sun
upon
my
shoulders
warmed
me
to
the
heart
and
i
stooped
forward
and
plunged
into
the
sea
it
was
all
that
i
could
do
to
catch
a
trail
of
the
that
grew
so
thickly
on
the
terrace
but
once
so
far
anchored
i
secured
myself
by
grasping
a
whole
armful
of
these
thick
and
slimy
stalks
and
planting
my
feet
against
the
edge
i
looked
around
me
on
all
sides
the
clear
sand
stretched
forth
unbroken
it
came
to
the
foot
of
the
rocks
scoured
into
the
likeness
of
an
alley
in
a
garden
by
the
action
of
the
tides
and
before
me
for
as
far
as
i
could
see
nothing
was
visible
but
the
same
sand
upon
the
bottom
of
the
bay
yet
the
terrace
to
which
i
was
then
holding
was
as
thick
with
strong
as
a
tuft
of
heather
and
the
cliff
from
which
it
bulged
hung
draped
below
the
with
brown
lianas
in
this
complexity
of
forms
all
swaying
together
in
the
current
things
were
hard
to
be
distinguished
and
i
was
still
uncertain
whether
my
feet
were
pressed
upon
the
natural
rock
or
upon
the
timbers
of
the
armada
when
the
whole
tuft
of
tangle
came
away
in
my
hand
and
in
an
instant
i
was
on
the
surface
and
the
shores
of
the
bay
and
the
bright
water
swam
before
my
eyes
in
a
glory
of
crimson
i
clambered
back
upon
the
rocks
and
threw
the
plant
of
tangle
at
my
feet
something
at
the
same
moment
rang
sharply
like
a
falling
coin
i
stooped
and
there
sure
enough
crusted
with
the
red
rust
there
lay
an
iron
the
sight
of
this
poor
human
relic
thrilled
me
to
the
heart
but
not
with
hope
nor
fear
only
with
a
desolate
melancholy
i
held
it
in
my
hand
and
the
thought
of
its
owner
appeared
before
me
like
the
presence
of
an
actual
man
his
face
his
hands
his
hoarse
with
singing
at
the
capstan
the
very
foot
that
had
once
worn
that
buckle
and
trod
so
much
along
the
swerving
decks
the
whole
human
fact
of
him
as
a
creature
like
myself
with
hair
and
blood
and
seeing
eyes
haunted
me
in
that
sunny
solitary
place
not
like
a
spectre
but
like
some
friend
whom
i
had
basely
injured
was
the
great
treasure
ship
indeed
below
there
with
her
guns
and
chain
and
treasure
as
she
had
sailed
from
spain
her
decks
a
garden
for
the
seaweed
her
cabin
a
breeding
place
for
fish
soundless
but
for
the
dredging
water
motionless
but
for
the
waving
of
the
tangle
upon
her
battlements
that
old
populous
castle
now
a
reef
in
sandag
bay
or
as
i
thought
it
likelier
was
this
a
waif
from
the
disaster
of
the
foreign
brig
was
this
bought
but
the
other
day
and
worn
by
a
man
of
my
own
period
in
the
world
history
hearing
the
same
news
from
day
to
day
thinking
the
same
thoughts
praying
perhaps
in
the
same
temple
with
myself
however
it
was
i
was
assailed
with
dreary
thoughts
my
uncle
words
dead
are
down
there
echoed
in
my
ears
and
though
i
determined
to
dive
once
more
it
was
with
a
strong
repugnance
that
i
stepped
forward
to
the
margin
of
the
rocks
a
great
change
passed
at
that
moment
over
the
appearance
of
the
bay
it
was
no
more
that
clear
visible
interior
like
a
house
roofed
with
glass
where
the
green
submarine
sunshine
slept
so
stilly
a
breeze
i
suppose
had
flawed
the
surface
and
a
sort
of
trouble
and
blackness
filled
its
bosom
where
flashes
of
light
and
clouds
of
shadow
tossed
confusedly
together
even
the
terrace
below
obscurely
rocked
and
quivered
it
seemed
a
graver
thing
to
venture
on
this
place
of
ambushes
and
when
i
leaped
into
the
sea
the
second
time
it
was
with
a
quaking
in
my
soul
i
secured
myself
as
at
first
and
groped
among
the
waving
tangle
all
that
met
my
touch
was
cold
and
soft
and
gluey
the
thicket
was
alive
with
crabs
and
lobsters
trundling
to
and
fro
lopsidedly
and
i
had
to
harden
my
heart
against
the
horror
of
their
carrion
neighbourhood
on
all
sides
i
could
feel
the
grain
and
the
clefts
of
hard
living
stone
no
planks
no
iron
not
a
sign
of
any
wreck
the
was
not
there
i
remember
i
had
almost
a
sense
of
relief
in
my
disappointment
and
i
was
about
ready
to
leave
go
when
something
happened
that
sent
me
to
the
surface
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
i
had
already
stayed
somewhat
late
over
my
explorations
the
current
was
freshening
with
the
change
of
the
tide
and
sandag
bay
was
no
longer
a
safe
place
for
a
single
swimmer
well
just
at
the
last
moment
there
came
a
sudden
flush
of
current
dredging
through
the
tangles
like
a
wave
i
lost
one
hold
was
flung
sprawling
on
my
side
and
instinctively
grasping
for
a
fresh
support
my
fingers
closed
on
something
hard
and
cold
i
think
i
knew
at
that
moment
what
it
was
at
least
i
instantly
left
hold
of
the
tangle
leaped
for
the
surface
and
clambered
out
next
moment
on
the
friendly
rocks
with
the
bone
of
a
man
leg
in
my
grasp
mankind
is
a
material
creature
slow
to
think
and
dull
to
perceive
connections
the
grave
the
wreck
of
the
brig
and
the
rusty
were
surely
plain
advertisements
a
child
might
have
read
their
dismal
story
and
yet
it
was
not
until
i
touched
that
actual
piece
of
mankind
that
the
full
horror
of
the
charnel
ocean
burst
upon
my
spirit
i
laid
the
bone
beside
the
buckle
picked
up
my
clothes
and
ran
as
i
was
along
the
rocks
towards
the
human
shore
i
could
not
be
far
enough
from
the
spot
no
fortune
was
vast
enough
to
tempt
me
back
again
the
bones
of
the
drowned
dead
should
henceforth
roll
undisturbed
by
me
whether
on
tangle
or
minted
gold
but
as
soon
as
i
trod
the
good
earth
again
and
had
covered
my
nakedness
against
the
sun
i
knelt
down
over
against
the
ruins
of
the
brig
and
out
of
the
fulness
of
my
heart
prayed
long
and
passionately
for
all
poor
souls
upon
the
sea
a
generous
prayer
is
never
presented
in
vain
the
petition
may
be
refused
but
the
petitioner
is
always
i
believe
rewarded
by
some
gracious
visitation
the
horror
at
least
was
lifted
from
my
mind
i
could
look
with
calm
of
spirit
on
that
great
bright
creature
god
ocean
and
as
i
set
off
homeward
up
the
rough
sides
of
aros
nothing
remained
of
my
concern
beyond
a
deep
determination
to
meddle
no
more
with
the
spoils
of
wrecked
vessels
or
the
treasures
of
the
dead
i
was
already
some
way
up
the
hill
before
i
paused
to
breathe
and
look
behind
me
the
sight
that
met
my
eyes
was
doubly
strange
for
first
the
storm
that
i
had
foreseen
was
now
advancing
with
almost
tropical
rapidity
the
whole
surface
of
the
sea
had
been
dulled
from
its
conspicuous
brightness
to
an
ugly
hue
of
corrugated
lead
already
in
the
distance
the
white
waves
the
daughters
had
begun
to
flee
before
a
breeze
that
was
still
insensible
on
aros
and
already
along
the
curve
of
sandag
bay
there
was
a
splashing
run
of
sea
that
i
could
hear
from
where
i
stood
the
change
upon
the
sky
was
even
more
remarkable
there
had
begun
to
arise
out
of
the
a
huge
and
solid
continent
of
scowling
cloud
here
and
there
through
rents
in
its
contexture
the
sun
still
poured
a
sheaf
of
spreading
rays
and
here
and
there
from
all
its
edges
vast
inky
streamers
lay
forth
along
the
yet
unclouded
sky
the
menace
was
express
and
imminent
even
as
i
gazed
the
sun
was
blotted
out
at
any
moment
the
tempest
might
fall
upon
aros
in
its
might
the
suddenness
of
this
change
of
weather
so
fixed
my
eyes
on
heaven
that
it
was
some
seconds
before
they
alighted
on
the
bay
mapped
out
below
my
feet
and
robbed
a
moment
later
of
the
sun
the
knoll
which
i
had
just
surmounted
overflanked
a
little
amphitheatre
of
lower
hillocks
sloping
towards
the
sea
and
beyond
that
the
yellow
arc
of
beach
and
the
whole
extent
of
sandag
bay
it
was
a
scene
on
which
i
had
often
looked
down
but
where
i
had
never
before
beheld
a
human
figure
i
had
but
just
turned
my
back
upon
it
and
left
it
empty
and
my
wonder
may
be
fancied
when
i
saw
a
boat
and
several
men
in
that
deserted
spot
the
boat
was
lying
by
the
rocks
a
pair
of
fellows
bareheaded
with
their
sleeves
rolled
up
and
one
with
a
boathook
kept
her
with
difficulty
to
her
moorings
for
the
current
was
growing
brisker
every
moment
a
little
way
off
upon
the
ledge
two
men
in
black
clothes
whom
i
judged
to
be
superior
in
rank
laid
their
heads
together
over
some
task
which
at
first
i
did
not
understand
but
a
second
after
i
had
made
it
out
they
were
taking
bearings
with
the
compass
and
just
then
i
saw
one
of
them
unroll
a
sheet
of
paper
and
lay
his
finger
down
as
though
identifying
features
in
a
map
meanwhile
a
third
was
walking
to
and
fro
polling
among
the
rocks
and
peering
over
the
edge
into
the
water
while
i
was
still
watching
them
with
the
stupefaction
of
surprise
my
mind
hardly
yet
able
to
work
on
what
my
eyes
reported
this
third
person
suddenly
stooped
and
summoned
his
companions
with
a
cry
so
loud
that
it
reached
my
ears
upon
the
hill
the
others
ran
to
him
even
dropping
the
compass
in
their
hurry
and
i
could
see
the
bone
and
the
going
from
hand
to
hand
causing
the
most
unusual
gesticulations
of
surprise
and
interest
just
then
i
could
hear
the
seamen
crying
from
the
boat
and
saw
them
point
westward
to
that
cloud
continent
which
was
ever
the
more
rapidly
unfurling
its
blackness
over
heaven
the
others
seemed
to
consult
but
the
danger
was
too
pressing
to
be
braved
and
they
bundled
into
the
boat
carrying
my
relies
with
them
and
set
forth
out
of
the
bay
with
all
speed
of
oars
i
made
no
more
ado
about
the
matter
but
turned
and
ran
for
the
house
whoever
these
men
were
it
was
fit
my
uncle
should
be
instantly
informed
it
was
not
then
altogether
too
late
in
the
day
for
a
descent
of
the
jacobites
and
may
be
prince
charlie
whom
i
knew
my
uncle
to
detest
was
one
of
the
three
superiors
whom
i
had
seen
upon
the
rock
yet
as
i
ran
leaping
from
rock
to
rock
and
turned
the
matter
loosely
in
my
mind
this
theory
grew
ever
the
longer
the
less
welcome
to
my
reason
the
compass
the
map
the
interest
awakened
by
the
buckle
and
the
conduct
of
that
one
among
the
strangers
who
had
looked
so
often
below
him
in
the
water
all
seemed
to
point
to
a
different
explanation
of
their
presence
on
that
outlying
obscure
islet
of
the
western
sea
the
madrid
historian
the
search
instituted
by
robertson
the
bearded
stranger
with
the
rings
my
own
fruitless
search
that
very
morning
in
the
deep
water
of
sandag
bay
ran
together
piece
by
piece
in
my
memory
and
i
made
sure
that
these
strangers
must
be
spaniards
in
quest
of
ancient
treasure
and
the
lost
ship
of
the
armada
but
the
people
living
in
outlying
islands
such
as
aros
are
answerable
for
their
own
security
there
is
none
near
by
to
protect
or
even
to
help
them
and
the
presence
in
such
a
spot
of
a
crew
of
foreign
adventurers
poor
greedy
and
most
likely
lawless
filled
me
with
apprehensions
for
my
uncle
money
and
even
for
the
safety
of
his
daughter
i
was
still
wondering
how
we
were
to
get
rid
of
them
when
i
came
all
breathless
to
the
top
of
aros
the
whole
world
was
shadowed
over
only
in
the
extreme
east
on
a
hill
of
the
mainland
one
last
gleam
of
sunshine
lingered
like
a
jewel
rain
had
begun
to
fall
not
heavily
but
in
great
drops
the
sea
was
rising
with
each
moment
and
already
a
band
of
white
encircled
aros
and
the
nearer
coasts
of
grisapol
the
boat
was
still
pulling
seaward
but
i
now
became
aware
of
what
had
been
hidden
from
me
lower
down
a
large
heavily
sparred
handsome
schooner
lying
to
at
the
south
end
of
aros
since
i
had
not
seen
her
in
the
morning
when
i
had
looked
around
so
closely
at
the
signs
of
the
weather
and
upon
these
lone
waters
where
a
sail
was
rarely
visible
it
was
clear
she
must
have
lain
last
night
behind
the
uninhabited
eilean
gour
and
this
proved
conclusively
that
she
was
manned
by
strangers
to
our
coast
for
that
anchorage
though
good
enough
to
look
at
is
little
better
than
a
trap
for
ships
with
such
ignorant
sailors
upon
so
wild
a
coast
the
coming
gale
was
not
unlikely
to
bring
death
upon
its
wings
chapter
iv
the
gale
i
found
my
uncle
at
the
gable
end
watching
the
signs
of
the
weather
with
a
pipe
in
his
fingers
said
i
were
men
ashore
at
sandag
bay
i
had
no
time
to
go
further
indeed
i
not
only
forgot
my
words
but
even
my
weariness
so
strange
was
the
effect
on
uncle
gordon
he
dropped
his
pipe
and
fell
back
against
the
end
of
the
house
with
his
jaw
fallen
his
eyes
staring
and
his
long
face
as
white
as
paper
we
must
have
looked
at
one
another
silently
for
a
quarter
of
a
minute
before
he
made
answer
in
this
extraordinary
fashion
he
a
hair
kep
on
i
knew
as
well
as
if
i
had
been
there
that
the
man
who
now
lay
buried
at
sandag
had
worn
a
hairy
cap
and
that
he
had
come
ashore
alive
for
the
first
and
only
time
i
lost
toleration
for
the
man
who
was
my
benefactor
and
the
father
of
the
woman
i
hoped
to
call
my
wife
were
living
men
said
i
jacobites
perhaps
the
french
perhaps
pirates
perhaps
adventurers
come
here
to
seek
the
spanish
treasure
ship
but
whatever
they
may
be
dangerous
at
least
to
your
daughter
and
my
cousin
as
for
your
own
guilty
terrors
man
the
dead
sleeps
well
where
you
have
laid
him
i
stood
this
morning
by
his
grave
he
will
not
wake
before
the
trump
of
doom
my
kinsman
looked
upon
me
blinking
while
i
spoke
then
he
fixed
his
eyes
for
a
little
on
the
ground
and
pulled
his
fingers
foolishly
but
it
was
plain
that
he
was
past
the
power
of
speech
said
i
must
think
for
others
you
must
come
up
the
hill
with
me
and
see
this
ship
he
obeyed
without
a
word
or
a
look
following
slowly
after
my
impatient
strides
the
spring
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
his
body
and
he
scrambled
heavily
up
and
down
the
rocks
instead
of
leaping
as
he
was
wont
from
one
to
another
nor
could
i
for
all
my
cries
induce
him
to
make
better
haste
only
once
he
replied
to
me
complainingly
and
like
one
in
bodily
pain
ay
man
i
coming
long
before
we
had
reached
the
top
i
had
no
other
thought
for
him
but
pity
if
the
crime
had
been
monstrous
the
punishment
was
in
proportion
at
last
we
emerged
above
the
of
the
hill
and
could
see
around
us
all
was
black
and
stormy
to
the
eye
the
last
gleam
of
sun
had
vanished
a
wind
had
sprung
up
not
yet
high
but
gusty
and
unsteady
to
the
point
the
rain
on
the
other
hand
had
ceased
short
as
was
the
interval
the
sea
already
ran
vastly
higher
than
when
i
had
stood
there
last
already
it
had
begun
to
break
over
some
of
the
outward
reefs
and
already
it
moaned
aloud
in
the
of
aros
i
looked
at
first
in
vain
for
the
schooner
she
is
i
said
at
last
but
her
new
position
and
the
course
she
was
now
lying
puzzled
me
can
not
mean
to
beat
to
sea
i
cried
what
they
mean
said
my
uncle
with
something
like
joy
and
just
then
the
schooner
went
about
and
stood
upon
another
tack
which
put
the
question
beyond
the
reach
of
doubt
these
strangers
seeing
a
gale
on
hand
had
thought
first
of
with
the
wind
that
threatened
in
these
waters
and
contending
against
so
violent
a
stream
of
tide
their
course
was
certain
death
god
said
i
are
all
lost
returned
my
uncle
a
lost
they
hadnae
a
chance
but
to
rin
for
kyle
dona
the
gate
they
gaun
the
noo
they
couldnae
win
through
an
the
muckle
deil
were
there
to
pilot
them
eh
man
he
continued
touching
me
on
the
sleeve
a
braw
nicht
for
a
shipwreck
twa
in
ae
twalmonth
eh
but
the
merry
men
dance
bonny
i
looked
at
him
and
it
was
then
that
i
began
to
fancy
him
no
longer
in
his
right
mind
he
was
peering
up
to
me
as
if
for
sympathy
a
timid
joy
in
his
eyes
all
that
had
passed
between
us
was
already
forgotten
in
the
prospect
of
this
fresh
disaster
it
were
not
too
late
i
cried
with
indignation
would
take
the
coble
and
go
out
to
warn
them
na
he
protested
maunnae
interfere
ye
maunnae
meddle
wi
the
like
o
that
it
his
doffing
his
bonnet
wull
and
eh
man
but
it
a
braw
nicht
something
like
fear
began
to
creep
into
my
soul
and
reminding
him
that
i
had
not
yet
dined
i
proposed
we
should
return
to
the
house
but
no
nothing
would
tear
him
from
his
place
of
outlook
maun
see
the
hail
thing
man
cherlie
he
explained
and
then
as
the
schooner
went
about
a
second
time
but
they
her
bonny
he
cried
was
naething
to
this
already
the
men
on
board
the
schooner
must
have
begun
to
realise
some
part
but
not
yet
the
twentieth
of
the
dangers
that
environed
their
doomed
ship
at
every
lull
of
the
capricious
wind
they
must
have
seen
how
fast
the
current
swept
them
back
each
tack
was
made
shorter
as
they
saw
how
little
it
prevailed
every
moment
the
rising
swell
began
to
boom
and
foam
upon
another
sunken
reef
and
ever
and
again
a
breaker
would
fall
in
sounding
ruin
under
the
very
bows
of
her
and
the
brown
reef
and
streaming
tangle
appear
in
the
hollow
of
the
wave
i
tell
you
they
had
to
stand
to
their
tackle
there
was
no
idle
men
aboard
that
ship
god
knows
it
was
upon
the
progress
of
a
scene
so
horrible
to
any
man
that
my
misguided
uncle
now
pored
and
gloated
like
a
connoisseur
as
i
turned
to
go
down
the
hill
he
was
lying
on
his
belly
on
the
summit
with
his
hands
stretched
forth
and
clutching
in
the
heather
he
seemed
rejuvenated
mind
and
body
when
i
got
back
to
the
house
already
dismally
affected
i
was
still
more
sadly
downcast
at
the
sight
of
mary
she
had
her
sleeves
rolled
up
over
her
strong
arms
and
was
quietly
making
bread
i
got
a
bannock
from
the
dresser
and
sat
down
to
eat
it
in
silence
ye
wearied
lad
she
asked
after
a
while
am
not
so
much
wearied
mary
i
replied
getting
on
my
feet
i
am
weary
of
delay
and
perhaps
of
aros
too
you
know
me
well
enough
to
judge
me
fairly
say
what
i
like
well
mary
you
may
be
sure
of
this
you
had
better
be
anywhere
but
here
be
sure
of
one
thing
she
returned
be
where
my
duty
is
forget
you
have
a
duty
to
yourself
i
said
man
she
replied
pounding
at
the
dough
you
have
found
that
in
the
bible
now
i
said
solemnly
must
not
laugh
at
me
just
now
god
knows
i
am
in
no
heart
for
laughing
if
we
could
get
your
father
with
us
it
would
be
best
but
with
him
or
without
him
i
want
you
far
away
from
here
my
girl
for
your
own
sake
and
for
mine
ay
and
for
your
too
i
want
you
far
far
away
from
here
i
came
with
other
thoughts
i
came
here
as
a
man
comes
home
now
it
is
all
changed
and
i
have
no
desire
nor
hope
but
to
flee
for
that
the
word
flee
like
a
bird
out
of
the
fowler
snare
from
this
accursed
island
she
had
stopped
her
work
by
this
time
do
you
think
now
said
she
you
think
now
i
have
neither
eyes
nor
ears
do
ye
think
i
havenae
broken
my
heart
to
have
these
braws
as
he
calls
them
god
forgive
him
thrown
into
the
sea
do
ye
think
i
have
lived
with
him
day
in
day
out
and
not
seen
what
you
saw
in
an
hour
or
two
no
she
said
know
there
wrong
in
it
what
wrong
i
neither
know
nor
want
to
know
there
was
never
an
ill
thing
made
better
by
meddling
that
i
could
hear
of
but
my
lad
you
must
never
ask
me
to
leave
my
father
while
the
breath
is
in
his
body
i
be
with
him
and
he
not
long
for
here
either
that
i
can
tell
you
charlie
he
not
long
for
here
the
mark
is
on
his
brow
and
better
so
maybe
better
so
i
was
a
while
silent
not
knowing
what
to
say
and
when
i
roused
my
head
at
last
to
speak
she
got
before
me
she
said
right
for
me
neednae
be
right
for
you
there
sin
upon
this
house
and
trouble
you
are
a
stranger
take
your
things
upon
your
back
and
go
your
ways
to
better
places
and
to
better
folk
and
if
you
were
ever
minded
to
come
back
though
it
were
twenty
years
syne
you
would
find
me
aye
waiting
ellen
i
said
asked
you
to
be
my
wife
and
you
said
as
good
as
yes
that
done
for
good
wherever
you
are
i
am
as
i
shall
answer
to
my
god
as
i
said
the
words
the
wind
suddenly
burst
out
raving
and
then
seemed
to
stand
still
and
shudder
round
the
house
of
aros
it
was
the
first
squall
or
prologue
of
the
coming
tempest
and
as
we
started
and
looked
about
us
we
found
that
a
gloom
like
the
approach
of
evening
had
settled
round
the
house
pity
all
poor
folks
at
sea
she
said
see
no
more
of
my
father
till
the
morrow
morning
and
then
she
told
me
as
we
sat
by
the
fire
and
hearkened
to
the
rising
gusts
of
how
this
change
had
fallen
upon
my
uncle
all
last
winter
he
had
been
dark
and
fitful
in
his
mind
whenever
the
roost
ran
high
or
as
mary
said
whenever
the
merry
men
were
dancing
he
would
lie
out
for
hours
together
on
the
head
if
it
were
at
night
or
on
the
top
of
aros
by
day
watching
the
tumult
of
the
sea
and
sweeping
the
horizon
for
a
sail
after
february
the
tenth
when
the
wreck
was
cast
ashore
at
sandag
he
had
been
at
first
unnaturally
gay
and
his
excitement
had
never
fallen
in
degree
but
only
changed
in
kind
from
dark
to
darker
he
neglected
his
work
and
kept
rorie
idle
they
two
would
speak
together
by
the
hour
at
the
gable
end
in
guarded
tones
and
with
an
air
of
secrecy
and
almost
of
guilt
and
if
she
questioned
either
as
at
first
she
sometimes
did
her
inquiries
were
put
aside
with
confusion
since
rorie
had
first
remarked
the
fish
that
hung
about
the
ferry
his
master
had
never
set
foot
but
once
upon
the
mainland
of
the
ross
that
once
it
was
in
the
height
of
the
springs
he
had
passed
dryshod
while
the
tide
was
out
but
having
lingered
overlong
on
the
far
side
found
himself
cut
off
from
aros
by
the
returning
waters
it
was
with
a
shriek
of
agony
that
he
had
leaped
across
the
gut
and
he
had
reached
home
thereafter
in
a
fit
of
fear
a
fear
of
the
sea
a
constant
haunting
thought
of
the
sea
appeared
in
his
talk
and
devotions
and
even
in
his
looks
when
he
was
silent
rorie
alone
came
in
to
supper
but
a
little
later
my
uncle
appeared
took
a
bottle
under
his
arm
put
some
bread
in
his
pocket
and
set
forth
again
to
his
outlook
followed
this
time
by
rorie
i
heard
that
the
schooner
was
losing
ground
but
the
crew
were
still
fighting
every
inch
with
hopeless
ingenuity
and
course
and
the
news
filled
my
mind
with
blackness
a
little
after
sundown
the
full
fury
of
the
gale
broke
forth
such
a
gale
as
i
have
never
seen
in
summer
nor
seeing
how
swiftly
it
had
come
even
in
winter
mary
and
i
sat
in
silence
the
house
quaking
overhead
the
tempest
howling
without
the
fire
between
us
sputtering
with
raindrops
our
thoughts
were
far
away
with
the
poor
fellows
on
the
schooner
or
my
not
less
unhappy
uncle
houseless
on
the
promontory
and
yet
ever
and
again
we
were
startled
back
to
ourselves
when
the
wind
would
rise
and
strike
the
gable
like
a
solid
body
or
suddenly
fall
and
draw
away
so
that
the
fire
leaped
into
flame
and
our
hearts
bounded
in
our
sides
now
the
storm
in
its
might
would
seize
and
shake
the
four
corners
of
the
roof
roaring
like
leviathan
in
anger
anon
in
a
lull
cold
eddies
of
tempest
moved
shudderingly
in
the
room
lifting
the
hair
upon
our
heads
and
passing
between
us
as
we
sat
and
again
the
wind
would
break
forth
in
a
chorus
of
melancholy
sounds
hooting
low
in
the
chimney
wailing
with
flutelike
softness
round
the
house
it
was
perhaps
eight
when
rorie
came
in
and
pulled
me
mysteriously
to
the
door
my
uncle
it
appeared
had
frightened
even
his
constant
comrade
and
rorie
uneasy
at
his
extravagance
prayed
me
to
come
out
and
share
the
watch
i
hastened
to
do
as
i
was
asked
the
more
readily
as
what
with
fear
and
horror
and
the
electrical
tension
of
the
night
i
was
myself
restless
and
disposed
for
action
i
told
mary
to
be
under
no
alarm
for
i
should
be
a
safeguard
on
her
father
and
wrapping
myself
warmly
in
a
plaid
i
followed
rorie
into
the
open
air
the
night
though
we
were
so
little
past
midsummer
was
as
dark
as
january
intervals
of
a
groping
twilight
alternated
with
spells
of
utter
blackness
and
it
was
impossible
to
trace
the
reason
of
these
changes
in
the
flying
horror
of
the
sky
the
wind
blew
the
breath
out
of
a
nostrils
all
heaven
seemed
to
thunder
overhead
like
one
huge
sail
and
when
there
fell
a
momentary
lull
on
aros
we
could
hear
the
gusts
dismally
sweeping
in
the
distance
over
all
the
lowlands
of
the
ross
the
wind
must
have
blown
as
fierce
as
on
the
open
sea
and
god
only
knows
the
uproar
that
was
raging
around
the
head
of
ben
kyaw
sheets
of
mingled
spray
and
rain
were
driven
in
our
faces
all
round
the
isle
of
aros
the
surf
with
an
incessant
hammering
thunder
beat
upon
the
reefs
and
beaches
now
louder
in
one
place
now
lower
in
another
like
the
combinations
of
orchestral
music
the
constant
mass
of
sound
was
hardly
varied
for
a
moment
and
loud
above
all
this
i
could
hear
the
changeful
voices
of
the
roost
and
the
intermittent
roaring
of
the
merry
men
at
that
hour
there
flashed
into
my
mind
the
reason
of
the
name
that
they
were
called
for
the
noise
of
them
seemed
almost
mirthful
as
it
the
other
noises
of
the
night
or
if
not
mirthful
yet
instinct
with
a
portentous
joviality
nay
and
it
seemed
even
human
as
when
savage
men
have
drunk
away
their
reason
and
discarding
speech
bawl
together
in
their
madness
by
the
hour
so
to
my
ears
these
deadly
breakers
shouted
by
aros
in
the
night
arm
in
arm
and
staggering
against
the
wind
rorie
and
i
won
every
yard
of
ground
with
conscious
effort
we
slipped
on
the
wet
sod
we
fell
together
sprawling
on
the
rocks
bruised
drenched
beaten
and
breathless
it
must
have
taken
us
near
half
an
hour
to
get
from
the
house
down
to
the
head
that
overlooks
the
roost
there
it
seemed
was
my
uncle
favourite
observatory
right
in
the
face
of
it
where
the
cliff
is
highest
and
most
sheer
a
hump
of
earth
like
a
parapet
makes
a
place
of
shelter
from
the
common
winds
where
a
man
may
sit
in
quiet
and
see
the
tide
and
the
mad
billows
contending
at
his
feet
as
he
might
look
down
from
the
window
of
a
house
upon
some
street
disturbance
so
from
this
post
he
looks
down
upon
the
tumbling
of
the
merry
men
on
such
a
night
of
course
he
peers
upon
a
world
of
blackness
where
the
waters
wheel
and
boil
where
the
waves
joust
together
with
the
noise
of
an
explosion
and
the
foam
towers
and
vanishes
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
never
before
had
i
seen
the
merry
men
thus
violent
the
fury
height
and
transiency
of
their
spoutings
was
a
thing
to
be
seen
and
not
recounted
high
over
our
heads
on
the
cliff
rose
their
white
columns
in
the
darkness
and
the
same
instant
like
phantoms
they
were
gone
sometimes
three
at
a
time
would
thus
aspire
and
vanish
sometimes
a
gust
took
them
and
the
spray
would
fall
about
us
heavy
as
a
wave
and
yet
the
spectacle
was
rather
maddening
in
its
levity
than
impressive
by
its
force
thought
was
beaten
down
by
the
confounding
uproar
a
gleeful
vacancy
possessed
the
brains
of
men
a
state
akin
to
madness
and
i
found
myself
at
times
following
the
dance
of
the
merry
men
as
it
were
a
tune
upon
a
jigging
instrument
i
first
caught
sight
of
my
uncle
when
we
were
still
some
yards
away
in
one
of
the
flying
glimpses
of
twilight
that
chequered
the
pitch
darkness
of
the
night
he
was
standing
up
behind
the
parapet
his
head
thrown
back
and
the
bottle
to
his
mouth
as
he
put
it
down
he
saw
and
recognised
us
with
a
toss
of
one
hand
fleeringly
above
his
head
he
been
drinking
shouted
i
to
rorie
will
aye
be
drunk
when
the
wind
blaws
returned
rorie
in
the
same
high
key
and
it
was
all
that
i
could
do
to
hear
him
was
he
so
in
february
i
inquired
rorie
was
a
cause
of
joy
to
me
the
murder
then
had
not
sprung
in
cold
blood
from
calculation
it
was
an
act
of
madness
no
more
to
be
condemned
than
to
be
pardoned
my
uncle
was
a
dangerous
madman
if
you
will
but
he
was
not
cruel
and
base
as
i
had
feared
yet
what
a
scene
for
a
carouse
what
an
incredible
vice
was
this
that
the
poor
man
had
chosen
i
have
always
thought
drunkenness
a
wild
and
almost
fearful
pleasure
rather
demoniacal
than
human
but
drunkenness
out
here
in
the
roaring
blackness
on
the
edge
of
a
cliff
above
that
hell
of
waters
the
man
head
spinning
like
the
roost
his
foot
tottering
on
the
edge
of
death
his
ear
watching
for
the
signs
of
surely
that
if
it
were
credible
in
any
one
was
morally
impossible
in
a
man
like
my
uncle
whose
mind
was
set
upon
a
damnatory
creed
and
haunted
by
the
darkest
superstitions
yet
so
it
was
and
as
we
reached
the
bight
of
shelter
and
could
breathe
again
i
saw
the
man
eyes
shining
in
the
night
with
an
unholy
glimmer
charlie
man
it
grand
he
cried
to
them
he
continued
dragging
me
to
the
edge
of
the
abyss
from
whence
arose
that
deafening
clamour
and
those
clouds
of
spray
to
them
dancin
man
is
that
no
wicked
he
pronounced
the
word
with
gusto
and
i
thought
it
suited
with
the
scene
yowlin
for
thon
schooner
he
went
on
his
thin
insane
voice
clearly
audible
in
the
shelter
of
the
bank
she
comin
aye
nearer
aye
nearer
aye
nearer
an
nearer
an
nearer
an
they
ke
the
folk
kens
it
they
ken
wool
it
by
wi
them
charlie
lad
they
a
drunk
in
yon
schooner
a
dozened
wi
drink
they
were
a
drunk
in
the
at
the
hinder
end
there
nane
could
droon
at
sea
wantin
the
brandy
hoot
awa
what
do
you
ken
with
a
sudden
blast
of
anger
tell
ye
it
cannae
be
they
droon
withoot
it
holding
out
the
bottle
a
sowp
i
was
about
to
refuse
but
rorie
touched
me
as
if
in
warning
and
indeed
i
had
already
thought
better
of
the
movement
i
took
the
bottle
therefore
and
not
only
drank
freely
myself
but
contrived
to
spill
even
more
as
i
was
doing
so
it
was
pure
spirit
and
almost
strangled
me
to
swallow
my
kinsman
did
not
observe
the
loss
but
once
more
throwing
back
his
head
drained
the
remainder
to
the
dregs
then
with
a
loud
laugh
he
cast
the
bottle
forth
among
the
merry
men
who
seemed
to
leap
up
shouting
to
receive
it
bairns
he
cried
your
ye
get
bonnier
nor
that
or
morning
suddenly
out
in
the
black
night
before
us
and
not
two
hundred
yards
away
we
heard
at
a
moment
when
the
wind
was
silent
the
clear
note
of
a
human
voice
instantly
the
wind
swept
howling
down
upon
the
head
and
the
roost
bellowed
and
churned
and
danced
with
a
new
fury
but
we
had
heard
the
sound
and
we
knew
with
agony
that
this
was
the
doomed
ship
now
close
on
ruin
and
that
what
we
had
heard
was
the
voice
of
her
master
issuing
his
last
command
crouching
together
on
the
edge
we
waited
straining
every
sense
for
the
inevitable
end
it
was
long
however
and
to
us
it
seemed
like
ages
ere
the
schooner
suddenly
appeared
for
one
brief
instant
relieved
against
a
tower
of
glimmering
foam
i
still
see
her
reefed
mainsail
flapping
loose
as
the
boom
fell
heavily
across
the
deck
i
still
see
the
black
outline
of
the
hull
and
still
think
i
can
distinguish
the
figure
of
a
man
stretched
upon
the
tiller
yet
the
whole
sight
we
had
of
her
passed
swifter
than
lightning
the
very
wave
that
disclosed
her
fell
burying
her
for
ever
the
mingled
cry
of
many
voices
at
the
point
of
death
rose
and
was
quenched
in
the
roaring
of
the
merry
men
and
with
that
the
tragedy
was
at
an
end
the
strong
ship
with
all
her
gear
and
the
lamp
perhaps
still
burning
in
the
cabin
the
lives
of
so
many
men
precious
surely
to
others
dear
at
least
as
heaven
to
themselves
had
all
in
that
one
moment
gone
down
into
the
surging
waters
they
were
gone
like
a
dream
and
the
wind
still
ran
and
shouted
and
the
senseless
waters
in
the
roost
still
leaped
and
tumbled
as
before
how
long
we
lay
there
together
we
three
speechless
and
motionless
is
more
than
i
can
tell
but
it
must
have
been
for
long
at
length
one
by
one
and
almost
mechanically
we
crawled
back
into
the
shelter
of
the
bank
as
i
lay
against
the
parapet
wholly
wretched
and
not
entirely
master
of
my
mind
i
could
hear
my
kinsman
maundering
to
himself
in
an
altered
and
melancholy
mood
now
he
would
repeat
to
himself
with
maudlin
iteration
a
fecht
as
they
had
sic
a
sair
fecht
as
they
had
puir
lads
puir
lads
and
anon
he
would
bewail
that
the
gear
was
as
gude
tint
because
the
ship
had
gone
down
among
the
merry
men
instead
of
stranding
on
the
shore
and
throughout
the
name
the
would
come
and
go
in
his
divagations
pronounced
with
shuddering
awe
the
storm
all
this
time
was
rapidly
abating
in
half
an
hour
the
wind
had
fallen
to
a
breeze
and
the
change
was
accompanied
or
caused
by
a
heavy
cold
and
plumping
rain
i
must
then
have
fallen
asleep
and
when
i
came
to
myself
drenched
stiff
and
unrefreshed
day
had
already
broken
grey
wet
discomfortable
day
the
wind
blew
in
faint
and
shifting
capfuls
the
tide
was
out
the
roost
was
at
its
lowest
and
only
the
strong
beating
surf
round
all
the
coasts
of
aros
remained
to
witness
of
the
furies
of
the
night
chapter
a
man
out
of
the
sea
rorie
set
out
for
the
house
in
search
of
warmth
and
breakfast
but
my
uncle
was
bent
upon
examining
the
shores
of
aros
and
i
felt
it
a
part
of
duty
to
accompany
him
throughout
he
was
now
docile
and
quiet
but
tremulous
and
weak
in
mind
and
body
and
it
was
with
the
eagerness
of
a
child
that
he
pursued
his
exploration
he
climbed
far
down
upon
the
rocks
on
the
beaches
he
pursued
the
retreating
breakers
the
merest
broken
plank
or
rag
of
cordage
was
a
treasure
in
his
eyes
to
be
secured
at
the
peril
of
his
life
to
see
him
with
weak
and
stumbling
footsteps
expose
himself
to
the
pursuit
of
the
surf
or
the
snares
and
pitfalls
of
the
weedy
rock
kept
me
in
a
perpetual
terror
my
arm
was
ready
to
support
him
my
hand
clutched
him
by
the
skirt
i
helped
him
to
draw
his
pitiful
discoveries
beyond
the
reach
of
the
returning
wave
a
nurse
accompanying
a
child
of
seven
would
have
had
no
different
experience
yet
weakened
as
he
was
by
the
reaction
from
his
madness
of
the
night
before
the
passions
that
smouldered
in
his
nature
were
those
of
a
strong
man
his
terror
of
the
sea
although
conquered
for
the
moment
was
still
undiminished
had
the
sea
been
a
lake
of
living
flames
he
could
not
have
shrunk
more
panically
from
its
touch
and
once
when
his
foot
slipped
and
he
plunged
to
the
midleg
into
a
pool
of
water
the
shriek
that
came
up
out
of
his
soul
was
like
the
cry
of
death
he
sat
still
for
a
while
panting
like
a
dog
after
that
but
his
desire
for
the
spoils
of
shipwreck
triumphed
once
more
over
his
fears
once
more
he
tottered
among
the
curded
foam
once
more
he
crawled
upon
the
rocks
among
the
bursting
bubbles
once
more
his
whole
heart
seemed
to
be
set
on
driftwood
fit
if
it
was
fit
for
anything
to
throw
upon
the
fire
pleased
as
he
was
with
what
he
found
he
still
incessantly
grumbled
at
his
he
said
no
a
place

wrecks

and
the
best
o

said
i
for
we
were
now
on
a
stretch
of
open
sand
where
there
was
nothing
to
divert
his
mind
saw
you
last
night
as
i
never
thought
to
see
you
you
were
drunk
na
he
said
as
bad
as
that

and
to
tell
ye
the
god
truth
it
a
thing
i
cannae

ower

like

i
think
naething
o
the
puir
sailor
lads
wi
the
sea
i
just
like
ane
o
her
ain
merry
men
i
thought
i
should
touch
him
in
a
joint
of
his
harness
i
turned
me
towards
the
sea
the
surf
was
running
gaily
wave
after
wave
with
their
manes
blowing
behind
them
riding
one
after
another
up
the
beach
towering
curving
falling
one
upon
another
on
the
trampled
sand
without
the
salt
air
the
scared
gulls
the
widespread
army
of
the
chargers
neighing
to
each
other
as
they
gathered
together
to
the
assault
of
aros
and
close
before
us
that
line
on
the
flat
sands
that
with
all
their
number
and
their
fury
they
might
never
pass
far
shalt
thou
go
said
i
no
farther
and
then
i
quoted
as
solemnly
as
i
was
able
a
verse
that
i
had
often
before
fitted
to
the
chorus
of
the
breakers
but
yet
the
lord
that
is
on
high
is
more
of
might
by
far
than
noise
of
many
waters
is
as
great
sea
billows
are
said
my
kinsinan
the
hinder
end
the
lord
will
triumph
i
dinnae
misdoobt
that
but
here
on
earth
even
silly
daur
him
to
his
face
it
is
nae
wise
i
am
nae
sayin
that
it
wise
but
it
the
pride
of
the
eye
and
it
the
lust
o
life
an
it
the
wale
pleesures
i
said
no
more
for
we
had
now
begun
to
cross
a
neck
of
land
that
lay
between
us
and
sandag
and
i
withheld
my
last
appeal
to
the
man
better
reason
till
we
should
stand
upon
the
spot
associated
with
his
crime
nor
did
he
pursue
the
subject
but
he
walked
beside
me
with
a
firmer
step
the
call
that
i
had
made
upon
his
mind
acted
like
a
stimulant
and
i
could
see
that
he
had
forgotten
his
search
for
worthless
jetsam
in
a
profound
gloomy
and
yet
stirring
train
of
thought
in
three
or
four
minutes
we
had
topped
the
brae
and
begun
to
go
down
upon
sandag
the
wreck
had
been
roughly
handled
by
the
sea
the
stem
had
been
spun
round
and
dragged
a
little
lower
down
and
perhaps
the
stern
had
been
forced
a
little
higher
for
the
two
parts
now
lay
entirely
separate
on
the
beach
when
we
came
to
the
grave
i
stopped
uncovered
my
head
in
the
thick
rain
and
looking
my
kinsman
in
the
face
addressed
him
man
said
i
in
god
providence
suffered
to
escape
from
mortal
dangers
he
was
poor
he
was
naked
he
was
wet
he
was
weary
he
was
a
stranger
he
had
every
claim
upon
the
bowels
of
your
compassion
it
may
be
that
he
was
the
salt
of
the
earth
holy
helpful
and
kind
it
may
be
he
was
a
man
laden
with
iniquities
to
whom
death
was
the
beginning
of
torment
i
ask
you
in
the
sight
of
heaven
gordon
darnaway
where
is
the
man
for
whom
christ
died
he
started
visibly
at
the
last
words
but
there
came
no
answer
and
his
face
expressed
no
feeling
but
a
vague
alarm
were
my
father
brother
i
continued
have
taught
me
to
count
your
house
as
if
it
were
my
father
house
and
we
are
both
sinful
men
walking
before
the
lord
among
the
sins
and
dangers
of
this
life
it
is
by
our
evil
that
god
leads
us
into
good
we
sin
i
dare
not
say
by
his
temptation
but
i
must
say
with
his
consent
and
to
any
but
the
brutish
man
his
sins
are
the
beginning
of
wisdom
god
has
warned
you
by
this
crime
he
warns
you
still
by
the
bloody
grave
between
our
feet
and
if
there
shall
follow
no
repentance
no
improvement
no
return
to
him
what
can
we
look
for
but
the
following
of
some
memorable
judgment
even
as
i
spoke
the
words
the
eyes
of
my
uncle
wandered
from
my
face
a
change
fell
upon
his
looks
that
can
not
be
described
his
features
seemed
to
dwindle
in
size
the
colour
faded
from
his
cheeks
one
hand
rose
waveringly
and
pointed
over
my
shoulder
into
the
distance
and
the
repeated
name
fell
once
more
from
his
lips
i
turned
and
if
i
was
not
appalled
to
the
same
degree
as
i
return
thanks
to
heaven
that
i
had
not
the
cause
i
was
still
startled
by
the
sight
that
met
my
eyes
the
form
of
a
man
stood
upright
on
the
hutch
of
the
wrecked
ship
his
back
was
towards
us
he
appeared
to
be
scanning
the
offing
with
shaded
eyes
and
his
figure
was
relieved
to
its
full
height
which
was
plainly
very
great
against
the
sea
and
sky
i
have
said
a
thousand
times
that
i
am
not
superstitious
but
at
that
moment
with
my
mind
running
upon
death
and
sin
the
unexplained
appearance
of
a
stranger
on
that
solitary
island
filled
me
with
a
surprise
that
bordered
close
on
terror
it
seemed
scarce
possible
that
any
human
soul
should
have
come
ashore
alive
in
such
a
sea
as
had
rated
last
night
along
the
coasts
of
aros
and
the
only
vessel
within
miles
had
gone
down
before
our
eyes
among
the
merry
men
i
was
assailed
with
doubts
that
made
suspense
unbearable
and
to
put
the
matter
to
the
touch
at
once
stepped
forward
and
hailed
the
figure
like
a
ship
he
turned
about
and
i
thought
he
started
to
behold
us
at
this
my
courage
instantly
revived
and
i
called
and
signed
to
him
to
draw
near
and
he
on
his
part
dropped
immediately
to
the
sands
and
began
slowly
to
approach
with
many
stops
and
hesitations
at
each
repeated
mark
of
the
man
uneasiness
i
grew
the
more
confident
myself
and
i
advanced
another
step
encouraging
him
as
i
did
so
with
my
head
and
hand
it
was
plain
the
castaway
had
heard
indifferent
accounts
of
our
island
hospitality
and
indeed
about
this
time
the
people
farther
north
had
a
sorry
reputation
i
said
man
is
black
and
just
at
that
moment
in
a
voice
that
i
could
scarce
have
recognised
my
kinsman
began
swearing
and
praying
in
a
mingled
stream
i
looked
at
him
he
had
fallen
on
his
knees
his
face
was
agonised
at
each
step
of
the
castaway
the
pitch
of
his
voice
rose
the
volubility
of
his
utterance
and
the
fervour
of
his
language
redoubled
i
call
it
prayer
for
it
was
addressed
to
god
but
surely
no
such
ranting
incongruities
were
ever
before
addressed
to
the
creator
by
a
creature
surely
if
prayer
can
be
a
sin
this
mad
harangue
was
sinful
i
ran
to
my
kinsman
i
seized
him
by
the
shoulders
i
dragged
him
to
his
feet
man
said
i
your
god
in
words
if
not
in
action
here
on
the
very
scene
of
your
transgressions
he
sends
you
an
occasion
of
atonement
forward
and
embrace
it
welcome
like
a
father
yon
creature
who
comes
trembling
to
your
mercy
with
that
i
tried
to
force
him
towards
the
black
but
he
felled
me
to
the
ground
burst
from
my
grasp
leaving
the
shoulder
of
his
jacket
and
fled
up
the
hillside
towards
the
top
of
aros
like
a
deer
i
staggered
to
my
feet
again
bruised
and
somewhat
stunned
the
negro
had
paused
in
surprise
perhaps
in
terror
some
halfway
between
me
and
the
wreck
my
uncle
was
already
far
away
bounding
from
rock
to
rock
and
i
thus
found
myself
torn
for
a
time
between
two
duties
but
i
judged
and
i
pray
heaven
that
i
judged
rightly
in
favour
of
the
poor
wretch
upon
the
sands
his
misfortune
was
at
least
not
plainly
of
his
own
creation
it
was
one
besides
that
i
could
certainly
relieve
and
i
had
begun
by
that
time
to
regard
my
uncle
as
an
incurable
and
dismal
lunatic
i
advanced
accordingly
towards
the
black
who
now
awaited
my
approach
with
folded
arms
like
one
prepared
for
either
destiny
as
i
came
nearer
he
reached
forth
his
hand
with
a
great
gesture
such
as
i
had
seen
from
the
pulpit
and
spoke
to
me
in
something
of
a
pulpit
voice
but
not
a
word
was
comprehensible
i
tried
him
first
in
english
then
in
gaelic
both
in
vain
so
that
it
was
clear
we
must
rely
upon
the
tongue
of
looks
and
gestures
thereupon
i
signed
to
him
to
follow
me
which
he
did
readily
and
with
a
grave
obeisance
like
a
fallen
king
all
the
while
there
had
come
no
shade
of
alteration
in
his
face
neither
of
anxiety
while
he
was
still
waiting
nor
of
relief
now
that
he
was
reassured
if
he
were
a
slave
as
i
supposed
i
could
not
but
judge
he
must
have
fallen
from
some
high
place
in
his
own
country
and
fallen
as
he
was
i
could
not
but
admire
his
bearing
as
we
passed
the
grave
i
paused
and
raised
my
hands
and
eyes
to
heaven
in
token
of
respect
and
sorrow
for
the
dead
and
he
as
if
in
answer
bowed
low
and
spread
his
hands
abroad
it
was
a
strange
motion
but
done
like
a
thing
of
common
custom
and
i
supposed
it
was
ceremonial
in
the
land
from
which
he
came
at
the
same
time
he
pointed
to
my
uncle
whom
we
could
just
see
perched
upon
a
knoll
and
touched
his
head
to
indicate
that
he
was
mad
we
took
the
long
way
round
the
shore
for
i
feared
to
excite
my
uncle
if
we
struck
across
the
island
and
as
we
walked
i
had
time
enough
to
mature
the
little
dramatic
exhibition
by
which
i
hoped
to
satisfy
my
doubts
accordingly
pausing
on
a
rock
i
proceeded
to
imitate
before
the
negro
the
action
of
the
man
whom
i
had
seen
the
day
before
taking
bearings
with
the
compass
at
sandag
he
understood
me
at
once
and
taking
the
imitation
out
of
my
hands
showed
me
where
the
boat
was
pointed
out
seaward
as
if
to
indicate
the
position
of
the
schooner
and
then
down
along
the
edge
of
the
rock
with
the
words
santo
strangely
pronounced
but
clear
enough
for
recognition
i
had
thus
been
right
in
my
conjecture
the
pretended
historical
inquiry
had
been
but
a
cloak
for
the
man
who
had
played
on
robertson
was
the
same
as
the
foreigner
who
visited
grisapol
in
spring
and
now
with
many
others
lay
dead
under
the
roost
of
aros
there
had
their
greed
brought
them
there
should
their
bones
be
tossed
for
evermore
in
the
meantime
the
black
continued
his
imitation
of
the
scene
now
looking
up
skyward
as
though
watching
the
approach
of
the
storm
now
in
the
character
of
a
seaman
waving
the
rest
to
come
aboard
now
as
an
officer
running
along
the
rock
and
entering
the
boat
and
anon
bending
over
imaginary
oars
with
the
air
of
a
hurried
boatman
but
all
with
the
same
solemnity
of
manner
so
that
i
was
never
even
moved
to
smile
lastly
he
indicated
to
me
by
a
pantomime
not
to
be
described
in
words
how
he
himself
had
gone
up
to
examine
the
stranded
wreck
and
to
his
grief
and
indignation
had
been
deserted
by
his
comrades
and
thereupon
folded
his
arms
once
more
and
stooped
his
head
like
one
accepting
fate
the
mystery
of
his
presence
being
thus
solved
for
me
i
explained
to
him
by
means
of
a
sketch
the
fate
of
the
vessel
and
of
all
aboard
her
he
showed
no
surprise
nor
sorrow
and
with
a
sudden
lifting
of
his
open
hand
seemed
to
dismiss
his
former
friends
or
masters
whichever
they
had
been
into
god
pleasure
respect
came
upon
me
and
grew
stronger
the
more
i
observed
him
i
saw
he
had
a
powerful
mind
and
a
sober
and
severe
character
such
as
i
loved
to
commune
with
and
before
we
reached
the
house
of
aros
i
had
almost
forgotten
and
wholly
forgiven
him
his
uncanny
colour
to
mary
i
told
all
that
had
passed
without
suppression
though
i
own
my
heart
failed
me
but
i
did
wrong
to
doubt
her
sense
of
justice
did
the
right
she
said
will
be
done
and
she
set
out
meat
for
us
at
once
as
soon
as
i
was
satisfied
i
bade
rorie
keep
an
eye
upon
the
castaway
who
was
still
eating
and
set
forth
again
myself
to
find
my
uncle
i
had
not
gone
far
before
i
saw
him
sitting
in
the
same
place
upon
the
very
topmost
knoll
and
seemingly
in
the
same
attitude
as
when
i
had
last
observed
him
from
that
point
as
i
have
said
the
most
of
aros
and
the
neighbouring
ross
would
be
spread
below
him
like
a
map
and
it
was
plain
that
he
kept
a
bright
in
all
directions
for
my
head
had
scarcely
risen
above
the
summit
of
the
first
ascent
before
he
had
leaped
to
his
feet
and
turned
as
if
to
face
me
i
hailed
him
at
once
as
well
as
i
was
able
in
the
same
tones
and
words
as
i
had
often
used
before
when
i
had
come
to
summon
him
to
dinner
he
made
not
so
much
as
a
movement
in
reply
i
passed
on
a
little
farther
and
again
tried
parley
with
the
same
result
but
when
i
began
a
second
time
to
advance
his
insane
fears
blazed
up
again
and
still
in
dead
silence
but
with
incredible
speed
he
began
to
flee
from
before
me
along
the
rocky
summit
of
the
hill
an
hour
before
he
had
been
dead
weary
and
i
had
been
comparatively
active
but
now
his
strength
was
recruited
by
the
fervour
of
insanity
and
it
would
have
been
vain
for
me
to
dream
of
pursuit
nay
the
very
attempt
i
thought
might
have
inflamed
his
terrors
and
thus
increased
the
miseries
of
our
position
and
i
had
nothing
left
but
to
turn
homeward
and
make
my
sad
report
to
mary
she
heard
it
as
she
had
heard
the
first
with
a
concerned
composure
and
bidding
me
lie
down
and
take
that
rest
of
which
i
stood
so
much
in
need
set
forth
herself
in
quest
of
her
misguided
father
at
that
age
it
would
have
been
a
strange
thing
that
put
me
from
either
meat
or
sleep
i
slept
long
and
deep
and
it
was
already
long
past
noon
before
i
awoke
and
came
downstairs
into
the
kitchen
mary
rorie
and
the
black
castaway
were
seated
about
the
fire
in
silence
and
i
could
see
that
mary
had
been
weeping
there
was
cause
enough
as
i
soon
learned
for
tears
first
she
and
then
rorie
had
been
forth
to
seek
my
uncle
each
in
turn
had
found
him
perched
upon
the
and
from
each
in
turn
he
had
silently
and
swiftly
fled
rorie
had
tried
to
chase
him
but
in
vain
madness
lent
a
new
vigour
to
his
bounds
he
sprang
from
rock
to
rock
over
the
widest
gullies
he
scoured
like
the
wind
along
the
he
doubled
and
twisted
like
a
hare
before
the
dogs
and
rorie
at
length
gave
in
and
the
last
that
he
saw
my
uncle
was
seated
as
before
upon
the
crest
of
aros
even
during
the
hottest
excitement
of
the
chase
even
when
the
servant
had
come
for
a
moment
very
near
to
capture
him
the
poor
lunatic
had
uttered
not
a
sound
he
fled
and
he
was
silent
like
a
beast
and
this
silence
had
terrified
his
pursuer
there
was
something
in
the
situation
how
to
capture
the
madman
how
to
feed
him
in
the
meanwhile
and
what
to
do
with
him
when
he
was
captured
were
the
three
difficulties
that
we
had
to
solve
black
said
i
the
cause
of
this
attack
it
may
even
be
his
presence
in
the
house
that
keeps
my
uncle
on
the
hill
we
have
done
the
fair
thing
he
has
been
fed
and
warmed
under
this
roof
now
i
propose
that
rorie
put
him
across
the
bay
in
the
coble
and
take
him
through
the
ross
as
far
as
grisapol
in
this
proposal
mary
heartily
concurred
and
bidding
the
black
follow
us
we
all
three
descended
to
the
pier
certainly
heaven
will
was
declared
against
gordon
darnaway
a
thing
had
happened
never
paralleled
before
in
aros
during
the
storm
the
coble
had
broken
loose
and
striking
on
the
rough
splinters
of
the
pier
now
lay
in
four
feet
of
water
with
one
side
stove
in
three
days
of
work
at
least
would
be
required
to
make
her
float
but
i
was
not
to
be
beaten
i
led
the
whole
party
round
to
where
the
gut
was
narrowest
swam
to
the
other
side
and
called
to
the
black
to
follow
me
he
signed
with
the
same
clearness
and
quiet
as
before
that
he
knew
not
the
art
and
there
was
truth
apparent
in
his
signals
it
would
have
occurred
to
none
of
us
to
doubt
his
truth
and
that
hope
being
over
we
must
all
go
back
even
as
we
came
to
the
house
of
aros
the
negro
walking
in
our
midst
without
embarrassment
all
we
could
do
that
day
was
to
make
one
more
attempt
to
communicate
with
the
unhappy
madman
again
he
was
visible
on
his
perch
again
he
fled
in
silence
but
food
and
a
great
cloak
were
at
least
left
for
his
comfort
the
rain
besides
had
cleared
away
and
the
night
promised
to
be
even
warm
we
might
compose
ourselves
we
thought
until
the
morrow
rest
was
the
chief
requisite
that
we
might
be
strengthened
for
unusual
exertions
and
as
none
cared
to
talk
we
separated
at
an
early
hour
i
lay
long
awake
planning
a
campaign
for
the
morrow
i
was
to
place
the
black
on
the
side
of
sandag
whence
he
should
head
my
uncle
towards
the
house
rorie
in
the
west
i
on
the
east
were
to
complete
the
cordon
as
best
we
might
it
seemed
to
me
the
more
i
recalled
the
configuration
of
the
island
that
it
should
be
possible
though
hard
to
force
him
down
upon
the
low
ground
along
aros
bay
and
once
there
even
with
the
strength
of
his
madness
ultimate
escape
was
hardly
to
be
feared
it
was
on
his
terror
of
the
black
that
i
relied
for
i
made
sure
however
he
might
run
it
would
not
be
in
the
direction
of
the
man
whom
he
supposed
to
have
returned
from
the
dead
and
thus
one
point
of
the
compass
at
least
would
be
secure
when
at
length
i
fell
asleep
it
was
to
be
awakened
shortly
after
by
a
dream
of
wrecks
black
men
and
submarine
adventure
and
i
found
myself
so
shaken
and
fevered
that
i
arose
descended
the
stair
and
stepped
out
before
the
house
within
rorie
and
the
black
were
asleep
together
in
the
kitchen
outside
was
a
wonderful
clear
night
of
stars
with
here
and
there
a
cloud
still
hanging
last
stragglers
of
the
tempest
it
was
near
the
top
of
the
flood
and
the
merry
men
were
roaring
in
the
windless
quiet
of
the
night
never
not
even
in
the
height
of
the
tempest
had
i
heard
their
song
with
greater
awe
now
when
the
winds
were
gathered
home
when
the
deep
was
dandling
itself
back
into
its
summer
slumber
and
when
the
stars
rained
their
gentle
light
over
land
and
sea
the
voice
of
these
was
still
raised
for
havoc
they
seemed
indeed
to
be
a
part
of
the
world
evil
and
the
tragic
side
of
life
nor
were
their
meaningless
vociferations
the
only
sounds
that
broke
the
silence
of
the
night
for
i
could
hear
now
shrill
and
thrilling
and
now
almost
drowned
the
note
of
a
human
voice
that
accompanied
the
uproar
of
the
roost
i
knew
it
for
my
kinsman
and
a
great
fear
fell
upon
me
of
god
judgments
and
the
evil
in
the
world
i
went
back
again
into
the
darkness
of
the
house
as
into
a
place
of
shelter
and
lay
long
upon
my
bed
pondering
these
mysteries
it
was
late
when
i
again
woke
and
i
leaped
into
my
clothes
and
hurried
to
the
kitchen
no
one
was
there
rorie
and
the
black
had
both
stealthily
departed
long
before
and
my
heart
stood
still
at
the
discovery
i
could
rely
on
rorie
heart
but
i
placed
no
trust
in
his
discretion
if
he
had
thus
set
out
without
a
word
he
was
plainly
bent
upon
some
service
to
my
uncle
but
what
service
could
he
hope
to
render
even
alone
far
less
in
the
company
of
the
man
in
whom
my
uncle
found
his
fears
incarnated
even
if
i
were
not
already
too
late
to
prevent
some
deadly
mischief
it
was
plain
i
must
delay
no
longer
with
the
thought
i
was
out
of
the
house
and
often
as
i
have
run
on
the
rough
sides
of
aros
i
never
ran
as
i
did
that
fatal
morning
i
do
not
believe
i
put
twelve
minutes
to
the
whole
ascent
my
uncle
was
gone
from
his
perch
the
basket
had
indeed
been
torn
open
and
the
meat
scattered
on
the
turf
but
as
we
found
afterwards
no
mouthful
had
been
tasted
and
there
was
not
another
trace
of
human
existence
in
that
wide
field
of
view
day
had
already
filled
the
clear
heavens
the
sun
already
lighted
in
a
rosy
bloom
upon
the
crest
of
ben
kyaw
but
all
below
me
the
rude
knolls
of
aros
and
the
shield
of
sea
lay
steeped
in
the
clear
darkling
twilight
of
the
dawn
i
cried
and
again
my
voice
died
in
the
silence
but
there
came
no
answer
back
if
there
were
indeed
an
enterprise
afoot
to
catch
my
uncle
it
was
plainly
not
in
fleetness
of
foot
but
in
dexterity
of
stalking
that
the
hunters
placed
their
trust
i
ran
on
farther
keeping
the
higher
spurs
and
looking
right
and
left
nor
did
i
pause
again
till
i
was
on
the
mount
above
sandag
i
could
see
the
wreck
the
uncovered
belt
of
sand
the
waves
idly
beating
the
long
ledge
of
rocks
and
on
either
hand
the
tumbled
knolls
boulders
and
gullies
of
the
island
but
still
no
human
thing
at
a
stride
the
sunshine
fell
on
aros
and
the
shadows
and
colours
leaped
into
being
not
half
a
moment
later
below
me
to
the
west
sheep
began
to
scatter
as
in
a
panic
there
came
a
cry
i
saw
my
uncle
running
i
saw
the
black
jump
up
in
hot
pursuit
and
before
i
had
time
to
understand
rorie
also
had
appeared
calling
directions
in
gaelic
as
to
a
dog
herding
sheep
i
took
to
my
heels
to
interfere
and
perhaps
i
had
done
better
to
have
waited
where
i
was
for
i
was
the
means
of
cutting
off
the
madman
last
escape
there
was
nothing
before
him
from
that
moment
but
the
grave
the
wreck
and
the
sea
in
sandag
bay
and
yet
heaven
knows
that
what
i
did
was
for
the
best
my
uncle
gordon
saw
in
what
direction
horrible
to
him
the
chase
was
driving
him
he
doubled
darting
to
the
right
and
left
but
high
as
the
fever
ran
in
his
veins
the
black
was
still
the
swifter
turn
where
he
would
he
was
still
forestalled
still
driven
toward
the
scene
of
his
crime
suddenly
he
began
to
shriek
aloud
so
that
the
coast
and
now
both
i
and
rorie
were
calling
on
the
black
to
stop
but
all
was
vain
for
it
was
written
otherwise
the
pursuer
still
ran
the
chase
still
sped
before
him
screaming
they
avoided
the
grave
and
skimmed
close
past
the
timbers
of
the
wreck
in
a
breath
they
had
cleared
the
sand
and
still
my
kinsman
did
not
pause
but
dashed
straight
into
the
surf
and
the
black
now
almost
within
reach
still
followed
swiftly
behind
him
rorie
and
i
both
stopped
for
the
thing
was
now
beyond
the
hands
of
men
and
these
were
the
decrees
of
god
that
came
to
pass
before
our
eyes
there
was
never
a
sharper
ending
on
that
steep
beach
they
were
beyond
their
depth
at
a
bound
neither
could
swim
the
black
rose
once
for
a
moment
with
a
throttling
cry
but
the
current
had
them
racing
seaward
and
if
ever
they
came
up
again
which
god
alone
can
tell
it
would
be
ten
minutes
after
at
the
far
end
of
aros
roost
where
the
seabirds
hover
fishing
will
o
the
mill
chapter
i
the
plain
and
the
stars
the
mill
here
will
lived
with
his
adopted
parents
stood
in
a
falling
valley
between
pinewoods
and
great
mountains
above
hill
after
hill
soared
upwards
until
they
soared
out
of
the
depth
of
the
hardiest
timber
and
stood
naked
against
the
sky
some
way
up
a
long
grey
village
lay
like
a
seam
or
a
ray
of
vapour
on
a
wooded
hillside
and
when
the
wind
was
favourable
the
sound
of
the
church
bells
would
drop
down
thin
and
silvery
to
will
below
the
valley
grew
ever
steeper
and
steeper
and
at
the
same
time
widened
out
on
either
hand
and
from
an
eminence
beside
the
mill
it
was
possible
to
see
its
whole
length
and
away
beyond
it
over
a
wide
plain
where
the
river
turned
and
shone
and
moved
on
from
city
to
city
on
its
voyage
towards
the
sea
it
chanced
that
over
this
valley
there
lay
a
pass
into
a
neighbouring
kingdom
so
that
quiet
and
rural
as
it
was
the
road
that
ran
along
beside
the
river
was
a
high
thoroughfare
between
two
splendid
and
powerful
societies
all
through
the
summer
came
crawling
up
or
went
plunging
briskly
downwards
past
the
mill
and
as
it
happened
that
the
other
side
was
very
much
easier
of
ascent
the
path
was
not
much
frequented
except
by
people
going
in
one
direction
and
of
all
the
carriages
that
will
saw
go
by
were
plunging
briskly
downwards
and
only
crawling
up
much
more
was
this
the
case
with
all
the
footed
tourists
all
the
pedlars
laden
with
strange
wares
were
tending
downward
like
the
river
that
accompanied
their
path
nor
was
this
all
for
when
will
was
yet
a
child
a
disastrous
war
arose
over
a
great
part
of
the
world
the
newspapers
were
full
of
defeats
and
victories
the
earth
rang
with
cavalry
hoofs
and
often
for
days
together
and
for
miles
around
the
coil
of
battle
terrified
good
people
from
their
labours
in
the
field
of
all
this
nothing
was
heard
for
a
long
time
in
the
valley
but
at
last
one
of
the
commanders
pushed
an
army
over
the
pass
by
forced
marches
and
for
three
days
horse
and
foot
cannon
and
tumbril
drum
and
standard
kept
pouring
downward
past
the
mill
all
day
the
child
stood
and
watched
them
on
their
passage
the
rhythmical
stride
the
pale
unshaven
faces
tanned
about
the
eyes
the
discoloured
regimentals
and
the
tattered
flags
filled
him
with
a
sense
of
weariness
pity
and
wonder
and
all
night
long
after
he
was
in
bed
he
could
hear
the
cannon
pounding
and
the
feet
trampling
and
the
great
armament
sweeping
onward
and
downward
past
the
mill
no
one
in
the
valley
ever
heard
the
fate
of
the
expedition
for
they
lay
out
of
the
way
of
gossip
in
those
troublous
times
but
will
saw
one
thing
plainly
that
not
a
man
returned
whither
had
they
all
gone
whither
went
all
the
tourists
and
pedlars
with
strange
wares
whither
all
the
brisk
barouches
with
servants
in
the
dicky
whither
the
water
of
the
stream
ever
coursing
downward
and
ever
renewed
from
above
even
the
wind
blew
oftener
down
the
valley
and
carried
the
dead
leaves
along
with
it
in
the
fall
it
seemed
like
a
great
conspiracy
of
things
animate
and
inanimate
they
all
went
downward
fleetly
and
gaily
downward
and
only
he
it
seemed
remained
behind
like
a
stock
upon
the
wayside
it
sometimes
made
him
glad
when
he
noticed
how
the
fishes
kept
their
heads
up
stream
they
at
least
stood
faithfully
by
him
while
all
else
were
posting
downward
to
the
unknown
world
one
evening
he
asked
the
miller
where
the
river
went
goes
down
the
valley
answered
he
turns
a
power
of
mills
six
score
mills
they
say
from
here
to
unterdeck
and
is
none
the
wearier
after
all
and
then
it
goes
out
into
the
lowlands
and
waters
the
great
corn
country
and
runs
through
a
sight
of
fine
cities
so
they
say
where
kings
live
all
alone
in
great
palaces
with
a
sentry
walling
up
and
down
before
the
door
and
it
goes
under
bridges
with
stone
men
upon
them
looking
down
and
smiling
so
curious
it
the
water
and
living
folks
leaning
their
elbows
on
the
wall
and
looking
over
too
and
then
it
goes
on
and
on
and
down
through
marshes
and
sands
until
at
last
it
falls
into
the
sea
where
the
ships
are
that
bring
parrots
and
tobacco
from
the
indies
ay
it
has
a
long
trot
before
it
as
it
goes
singing
over
our
weir
bless
its
heart
what
is
the
sea
asked
will
sea
cried
the
miller
help
us
all
it
is
the
greatest
thing
god
made
that
is
where
all
the
water
in
the
world
runs
down
into
a
great
salt
lake
there
it
lies
as
flat
as
my
hand
and
as
as
a
child
but
they
do
say
when
the
wind
blows
it
gets
up
into
mountains
bigger
than
any
of
ours
and
swallows
down
great
ships
bigger
than
our
mill
and
makes
such
a
roaring
that
you
can
hear
it
miles
away
upon
the
land
there
are
great
fish
in
it
five
times
bigger
than
a
bull
and
one
old
serpent
as
long
as
our
river
and
as
old
as
all
the
world
with
whiskers
like
a
man
and
a
crown
of
silver
on
her
head
will
thought
he
had
never
heard
anything
like
this
and
he
kept
on
asking
question
after
question
about
the
world
that
lay
away
down
the
river
with
all
its
perils
and
marvels
until
the
old
miller
became
quite
interested
himself
and
at
last
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
to
the
hilltop
that
overlooks
the
valley
and
the
plain
the
sun
was
near
setting
and
hung
low
down
in
a
cloudless
sky
everything
was
defined
and
glorified
in
golden
light
will
had
never
seen
so
great
an
expanse
of
country
in
his
life
he
stood
and
gazed
with
all
his
eyes
he
could
see
the
cities
and
the
woods
and
fields
and
the
bright
curves
of
the
river
and
far
away
to
where
the
rim
of
the
plain
trenched
along
the
shining
heavens
an
emotion
seized
upon
the
boy
soul
and
body
his
heart
beat
so
thickly
that
he
could
not
breathe
the
scene
swam
before
his
eyes
the
sun
seemed
to
wheel
round
and
round
and
throw
off
as
it
turned
strange
shapes
which
disappeared
with
the
rapidity
of
thought
and
were
succeeded
by
others
will
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
burst
into
a
violent
fit
of
tears
and
the
poor
miller
sadly
disappointed
and
perplexed
saw
nothing
better
for
it
than
to
take
him
up
in
his
arms
and
carry
him
home
in
silence
from
that
day
forward
will
was
full
of
new
hopes
and
longings
something
kept
tugging
at
his
the
running
water
carried
his
desires
along
with
it
as
he
dreamed
over
its
fleeting
surface
the
wind
as
it
ran
over
innumerable
hailed
him
with
encouraging
words
branches
beckoned
downward
the
open
road
as
it
shouldered
round
the
angles
and
went
turning
and
vanishing
fast
and
faster
down
the
valley
tortured
him
with
its
solicitations
he
spent
long
whiles
on
the
eminence
looking
down
the
rivershed
and
abroad
on
the
fat
lowlands
and
watched
the
clouds
that
travelled
forth
upon
the
sluggish
wind
and
trailed
their
purple
shadows
on
the
plain
or
he
would
linger
by
the
wayside
and
follow
the
carriages
with
his
eyes
as
they
rattled
downward
by
the
river
it
did
not
matter
what
it
was
everything
that
went
that
way
were
it
cloud
or
carriage
bird
or
brown
water
in
the
stream
he
felt
his
heart
flow
out
after
it
in
an
ecstasy
of
longing
we
are
told
by
men
of
science
that
all
the
ventures
of
mariners
on
the
sea
all
that
of
tribes
and
races
that
confounds
old
history
with
its
dust
and
rumour
sprang
from
nothing
more
abstruse
than
the
laws
of
supply
and
demand
and
a
certain
natural
instinct
for
cheap
rations
to
any
one
thinking
deeply
this
will
seem
a
dull
and
pitiful
explanation
the
tribes
that
came
swarming
out
of
the
north
and
east
if
they
were
indeed
pressed
onward
from
behind
by
others
were
drawn
at
the
same
time
by
the
magnetic
influence
of
the
south
and
west
the
fame
of
other
lands
had
reached
them
the
name
of
the
eternal
city
rang
in
their
ears
they
were
not
colonists
but
pilgrims
they
travelled
towards
wine
and
gold
and
sunshine
but
their
hearts
were
set
on
something
higher
that
divine
unrest
that
old
stinging
trouble
of
humanity
that
makes
all
high
achievements
and
all
miserable
failure
the
same
that
spread
wings
with
icarus
the
same
that
sent
columbus
into
the
desolate
atlantic
inspired
and
supported
these
barbarians
on
their
perilous
march
there
is
one
legend
which
profoundly
represents
their
spirit
of
how
a
flying
party
of
these
wanderers
encountered
a
very
old
man
shod
with
iron
the
old
man
asked
them
whither
they
were
going
and
they
answered
with
one
voice
the
eternal
city
he
looked
upon
them
gravely
have
sought
it
he
said
the
most
part
of
the
world
three
such
pairs
as
i
now
carry
on
my
feet
have
i
worn
out
upon
this
pilgrimage
and
now
the
fourth
is
growing
slender
underneath
my
steps
and
all
this
while
i
have
not
found
the
city
and
he
turned
and
went
his
own
way
alone
leaving
them
astonished
and
yet
this
would
scarcely
parallel
the
intensity
of
will
feeling
for
the
plain
if
he
could
only
go
far
enough
out
there
he
felt
as
if
his
eyesight
would
be
purged
and
clarified
as
if
his
hearing
would
grow
more
delicate
and
his
very
breath
would
come
and
go
with
luxury
he
was
transplanted
and
withering
where
he
was
he
lay
in
a
strange
country
and
was
sick
for
home
bit
by
bit
he
pieced
together
broken
notions
of
the
world
below
of
the
river
ever
moving
and
growing
until
it
sailed
forth
into
the
majestic
ocean
of
the
cities
full
of
brisk
and
beautiful
people
playing
fountains
bands
of
music
and
marble
palaces
and
lighted
up
at
night
from
end
to
end
with
artificial
stars
of
gold
of
the
great
churches
wise
universities
brave
armies
and
untold
money
lying
stored
in
vaults
of
the
vice
that
moved
in
the
sunshine
and
the
stealth
and
swiftness
of
midnight
murder
i
have
said
he
was
sick
as
if
for
home
the
figure
halts
he
was
like
some
one
lying
in
twilit
formless
preexistence
and
stretching
out
his
hands
lovingly
towards
coloured
life
it
was
no
wonder
he
was
unhappy
he
would
go
and
tell
the
fish
they
were
made
for
their
life
wished
for
no
more
than
worms
and
running
water
and
a
hole
below
a
falling
bank
but
he
was
differently
designed
full
of
desires
and
aspirations
itching
at
the
fingers
lusting
with
the
eyes
whom
the
whole
variegated
world
could
not
satisfy
with
aspects
the
true
life
the
true
bright
sunshine
lay
far
out
upon
the
plain
and
o
to
see
this
sunlight
once
before
he
died
to
move
with
a
jocund
spirit
in
a
golden
land
to
hear
the
trained
singers
and
sweet
church
bells
and
see
the
holiday
gardens
o
fish
he
would
cry
you
would
only
turn
your
noses
down
stream
you
could
swim
so
easily
into
the
fabled
waters
and
see
the
vast
ships
passing
over
your
head
like
clouds
and
hear
the
great
making
music
over
you
all
day
long
but
the
fish
kept
looking
patiently
in
their
own
direction
until
will
hardly
knew
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
hitherto
the
traffic
on
the
road
had
passed
by
will
like
something
seen
in
a
picture
he
had
perhaps
exchanged
salutations
with
a
tourist
or
caught
sight
of
an
old
gentleman
in
a
travelling
cap
at
a
carriage
window
but
for
the
most
part
it
had
been
a
mere
symbol
which
he
contemplated
from
apart
and
with
something
of
a
superstitious
feeling
a
time
came
at
last
when
this
was
to
be
changed
the
miller
who
was
a
greedy
man
in
his
way
and
never
forewent
an
opportunity
of
honest
profit
turned
the
into
a
little
wayside
inn
and
several
pieces
of
good
fortune
falling
in
opportunely
built
stables
and
got
the
position
of
post
master
on
the
road
it
now
became
will
duty
to
wait
upon
people
as
they
sat
to
break
their
fasts
in
the
little
arbour
at
the
top
of
the
mill
garden
and
you
may
be
sure
that
he
kept
his
ears
open
and
learned
many
new
things
about
the
outside
world
as
he
brought
the
omelette
or
the
wine
nay
he
would
often
get
into
conversation
with
single
guests
and
by
adroit
questions
and
polite
attention
not
only
gratify
his
own
curiosity
but
win
the
goodwill
of
the
travellers
many
complimented
the
old
couple
on
their
and
a
professor
was
eager
to
take
him
away
with
him
and
have
him
properly
educated
in
the
plain
the
miller
and
his
wife
were
mightily
astonished
and
even
more
pleased
they
thought
it
a
very
good
thing
that
they
should
have
opened
their
inn
see
the
old
man
would
remark
has
a
kind
of
talent
for
a
publican
he
never
would
have
made
anything
else
and
so
life
wagged
on
in
the
valley
with
high
satisfaction
to
all
concerned
but
will
every
carriage
that
left
the
seemed
to
take
a
part
of
him
away
with
it
and
when
people
jestingly
offered
him
a
lift
he
could
with
difficulty
command
his
emotion
night
after
night
he
would
dream
that
he
was
awakened
by
flustered
servants
and
that
a
splendid
equipage
waited
at
the
door
to
carry
him
down
into
the
plain
night
after
night
until
the
dream
which
had
seemed
all
jollity
to
him
at
first
began
to
take
on
a
colour
of
gravity
and
the
nocturnal
summons
and
waiting
equipage
occupied
a
place
in
his
mind
as
something
to
be
both
feared
and
hoped
for
one
day
when
will
was
about
sixteen
a
fat
young
man
arrived
at
sunset
to
pass
the
night
he
was
a
fellow
with
a
jolly
eye
and
carried
a
knapsack
while
dinner
was
preparing
he
sat
in
the
arbour
to
read
a
book
but
as
soon
as
he
had
begun
to
observe
will
the
book
was
laid
aside
he
was
plainly
one
of
those
who
prefer
living
people
to
people
made
of
ink
and
paper
will
on
his
part
although
he
had
not
been
much
interested
in
the
stranger
at
first
sight
soon
began
to
take
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
in
his
talk
which
was
full
of
good
nature
and
good
sense
and
at
last
conceived
a
great
respect
for
his
character
and
wisdom
they
sat
far
into
the
night
and
about
two
in
the
morning
will
opened
his
heart
to
the
young
man
and
told
him
how
he
longed
to
leave
the
valley
and
what
bright
hopes
he
had
connected
with
the
cities
of
the
plain
the
young
man
whistled
and
then
broke
into
a
smile
young
friend
he
remarked
are
a
very
curious
little
fellow
to
be
sure
and
wish
a
great
many
things
which
you
will
never
get
why
you
would
feel
quite
ashamed
if
you
knew
how
the
little
fellows
in
these
fairy
cities
of
yours
are
all
after
the
same
sort
of
nonsense
and
keep
breaking
their
hearts
to
get
up
into
the
mountains
and
let
me
tell
you
those
who
go
down
into
the
plains
are
a
very
short
while
there
before
they
wish
themselves
heartily
back
again
the
air
is
not
so
light
nor
so
pure
nor
is
the
sun
any
brighter
as
for
the
beautiful
men
and
women
you
would
see
many
of
them
in
rags
and
many
of
them
deformed
with
horrible
disorders
and
a
city
is
so
hard
a
place
for
people
who
are
poor
and
sensitive
that
many
choose
to
die
by
their
own
hand
must
think
me
very
simple
answered
will
i
have
never
been
out
of
this
valley
believe
me
i
have
used
my
eyes
i
know
how
one
thing
lives
on
another
for
instance
how
the
fish
hangs
in
the
eddy
to
catch
his
fellows
and
the
shepherd
who
makes
so
pretty
a
picture
carrying
home
the
lamb
is
only
carrying
it
home
for
dinner
i
do
not
expect
to
find
all
things
right
in
your
cities
that
is
not
what
troubles
me
it
might
have
been
that
once
upon
a
time
but
although
i
live
here
always
i
have
asked
many
questions
and
learned
a
great
deal
in
these
last
years
and
certainly
enough
to
cure
me
of
my
old
fancies
but
you
would
not
have
me
die
like
a
dog
and
not
see
all
that
is
to
be
seen
and
do
all
that
a
man
can
do
let
it
be
good
or
evil
you
would
not
have
me
spend
all
my
days
between
this
road
here
and
the
river
and
not
so
much
as
make
a
motion
to
be
up
and
live
my
life
i
would
rather
die
out
of
hand
he
cried
linger
on
as
i
am
doing
of
people
said
the
young
man
and
die
like
you
and
are
none
the
less
happy
said
will
there
are
thousands
who
would
like
why
should
not
one
of
them
have
my
place
it
was
quite
dark
there
was
a
hanging
lamp
in
the
arbour
which
lit
up
the
table
and
the
faces
of
the
speakers
and
along
the
arch
the
leaves
upon
the
trellis
stood
out
illuminated
against
the
night
sky
a
pattern
of
transparent
green
upon
a
dusky
purple
the
fat
young
man
rose
and
taking
will
by
the
arm
led
him
out
under
the
open
heavens
you
ever
look
at
the
stars
he
asked
pointing
upwards
and
often
answered
will
do
you
know
what
they
are
have
fancied
many
things
are
worlds
like
ours
said
the
young
man
of
them
less
many
of
them
a
million
times
greater
and
some
of
the
least
sparkles
that
you
see
are
not
only
worlds
but
whole
clusters
of
worlds
turning
about
each
other
in
the
midst
of
space
we
do
not
know
what
there
may
be
in
any
of
them
perhaps
the
answer
to
all
our
difficulties
or
the
cure
of
all
our
sufferings
and
yet
we
can
never
reach
them
not
all
the
skill
of
the
craftiest
of
men
can
fit
out
a
ship
for
the
nearest
of
these
our
neighbours
nor
would
the
life
of
the
most
aged
suffice
for
such
a
journey
when
a
great
battle
has
been
lost
or
a
dear
friend
is
dead
when
we
are
hipped
or
in
high
spirits
there
they
are
unweariedly
shining
overhead
we
may
stand
down
here
a
whole
army
of
us
together
and
shout
until
we
break
our
hearts
and
not
a
whisper
reaches
them
we
may
climb
the
highest
mountain
and
we
are
no
nearer
them
all
we
can
do
is
to
stand
down
here
in
the
garden
and
take
off
our
hats
the
starshine
lights
upon
our
heads
and
where
mine
is
a
little
bald
i
dare
say
you
can
see
it
glisten
in
the
darkness
the
mountain
and
the

is
like
to
be
all
we
shall
ever
have
to
do

his

upon

not
the
same

a

usually
vastly
more
convincing

hung
his
head
a
little
and
then
raised
it
once
more
to
heaven
the
stars
seemed
to
expand
and
emit
a
sharper
brilliancy
and
as
he
kept
turning
his
eyes
higher
and
higher
they
seemed
to
increase
in
multitude
under
his
gaze

he

you

chapter
ii
the
parson
marjory
after
some
years
the
old
people
died
both
in
one
winter
very
carefully
tended
by
their
adopted
son
and
very
quietly
mourned
when
they
were
gone
people
who
had
heard
of
his
roving
fancies
supposed
he
would
hasten
to
sell
the
property
and
go
down
the
river
to
push
his
fortunes
but
there
was
never
any
sign
of
such
in
intention
on
the
part
of
will
on
the
contrary
he
had
the
inn
set
on
a
better
footing
and
hired
a
couple
of
servants
to
assist
him
in
carrying
it
on
and
there
he
settled
down
a
kind
talkative
inscrutable
young
man
six
feet
three
in
his
stockings
with
an
iron
constitution
and
a
friendly
voice
he
soon
began
to
take
rank
in
the
district
as
a
bit
of
an
oddity
it
was
not
much
to
be
wondered
at
from
the
first
for
he
was
always
full
of
notions
and
kept
calling
the
plainest
in
question
but
what
most
raised
the
report
upon
him
was
the
odd
circumstance
of
his
courtship
with
the
parson
marjory
the
parson
marjory
was
a
lass
about
nineteen
when
will
would
be
about
thirty
well
enough
looking
and
much
better
educated
than
any
other
girl
in
that
part
of
the
country
as
became
her
parentage
she
held
her
head
very
high
and
had
already
refused
several
offers
of
marriage
with
a
grand
air
which
had
got
her
hard
names
among
the
neighbours
for
all
that
she
was
a
good
girl
and
one
that
would
have
made
any
man
well
contented
will
had
never
seen
much
of
her
for
although
the
church
and
parsonage
were
only
two
miles
from
his
own
door
he
was
never
known
to
go
there
but
on
sundays
it
chanced
however
that
the
parsonage
fell
into
disrepair
and
had
to
be
dismantled
and
the
parson
and
his
daughter
took
lodgings
for
a
month
or
so
on
very
much
reduced
terms
at
will
inn
now
what
with
the
inn
and
the
mill
and
the
old
miller
savings
our
friend
was
a
man
of
substance
and
besides
that
he
had
a
name
for
good
temper
and
shrewdness
which
make
a
capital
portion
in
marriage
and
so
it
was
currently
gossiped
among
their
that
the
parson
and
his
daughter
had
not
chosen
their
temporary
lodging
with
their
eyes
shut
will
was
about
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
be
cajoled
or
frightened
into
marriage
you
had
only
to
look
into
his
eyes
limpid
and
still
like
pools
of
water
and
yet
with
a
sort
of
clear
light
that
seemed
to
come
from
within
and
you
would
understand
at
once
that
here
was
one
who
knew
his
own
mind
and
would
stand
to
it
immovably
marjory
herself
was
no
weakling
by
her
looks
with
strong
steady
eyes
and
a
resolute
and
quiet
bearing
it
might
be
a
question
whether
she
was
not
will
match
in
stedfastness
after
all
or
which
of
them
would
rule
the
roost
in
marriage
but
marjory
had
never
given
it
a
thought
and
accompanied
her
father
with
the
most
unshaken
innocence
and
unconcern
the
season
was
still
so
early
that
will
customers
were
few
and
far
between
but
the
lilacs
were
already
flowering
and
the
weather
was
so
mild
that
the
party
took
dinner
under
the
trellice
with
the
noise
of
the
river
in
their
ears
and
the
woods
ringing
about
them
with
the
songs
of
birds
will
soon
began
to
take
a
particular
pleasure
in
these
dinners
the
parson
was
rather
a
dull
companion
with
a
habit
of
dozing
at
table
but
nothing
rude
or
cruel
ever
fell
from
his
lips
and
as
for
the
parson
daughter
she
suited
her
surroundings
with
the
best
grace
imaginable
and
whatever
she
said
seemed
so
pat
and
pretty
that
will
conceived
a
great
idea
of
her
talents
he
could
see
her
face
as
she
leaned
forward
against
a
background
of
rising
pinewoods
her
eyes
shone
peaceably
the
light
lay
around
her
hair
like
a
kerchief
something
that
was
hardly
a
smile
rippled
her
pale
cheeks
and
will
could
not
contain
himself
from
gazing
on
her
in
an
agreeable
dismay
she
looked
even
in
her
quietest
moments
so
complete
in
herself
and
so
quick
with
life
down
to
her
finger
tips
and
the
very
skirts
of
her
dress
that
the
remainder
of
created
things
became
no
more
than
a
blot
by
comparison
and
if
will
glanced
away
from
her
to
her
surroundings
the
trees
looked
inanimate
and
senseless
the
clouds
hung
in
heaven
like
dead
things
and
even
the
mountain
tops
were
disenchanted
the
whole
valley
could
not
compare
in
looks
with
this
one
girl
will
was
always
observant
in
the
society
of
his
but
his
observation
became
almost
painfully
eager
in
the
case
of
marjory
he
listened
to
all
she
uttered
and
read
her
eyes
at
the
same
time
for
the
unspoken
commentary
many
kind
simple
and
sincere
speeches
found
an
echo
in
his
heart
he
became
conscious
of
a
soul
beautifully
poised
upon
itself
nothing
doubting
nothing
desiring
clothed
in
peace
it
was
not
possible
to
separate
her
thoughts
from
her
appearance
the
turn
of
her
wrist
the
still
sound
of
her
voice
the
light
in
her
eyes
the
lines
of
her
body
fell
in
tune
with
her
grave
and
gentle
words
like
the
accompaniment
that
sustains
and
harmonises
the
voice
of
the
singer
her
influence
was
one
thing
not
to
be
divided
or
discussed
only
to
be
felt
with
gratitude
and
joy
to
will
her
presence
recalled
something
of
his
childhood
and
the
thought
of
her
took
its
place
in
his
mind
beside
that
of
dawn
of
running
water
and
of
the
earliest
violets
and
lilacs
it
is
the
property
of
things
seen
for
the
first
time
or
for
the
first
time
after
long
like
the
flowers
in
spring
to
reawaken
in
us
the
sharp
edge
of
sense
and
that
impression
of
mystic
strangeness
which
otherwise
passes
out
of
life
with
the
coming
of
years
but
the
sight
of
a
loved
face
is
what
renews
a
man
character
from
the
fountain
upwards
one
day
after
dinner
will
took
a
stroll
among
the
firs
a
grave
beatitude
possessed
him
from
top
to
toe
and
he
kept
smiling
to
himself
and
the
landscape
as
he
went
the
river
ran
between
the
with
a
pretty
wimple
a
bird
sang
loudly
in
the
wood
the
looked
immeasurably
high
and
as
he
glanced
at
them
from
time
to
time
seemed
to
contemplate
his
movements
with
a
beneficent
but
awful
curiosity
his
way
took
him
to
the
eminence
which
overlooked
the
plain
and
there
he
sat
down
upon
a
stone
and
fell
into
deep
and
pleasant
thought
the
plain
lay
abroad
with
its
cities
and
silver
river
everything
was
asleep
except
a
great
eddy
of
birds
which
kept
rising
and
falling
and
going
round
and
round
in
the
blue
air
he
repeated
marjory
name
aloud
and
the
sound
of
it
gratified
his
ear
he
shut
his
eyes
and
her
image
sprang
up
before
him
quietly
luminous
and
attended
with
good
thoughts
the
river
might
run
for
ever
the
birds
fly
higher
and
higher
till
they
touched
the
stars
he
saw
it
was
empty
bustle
after
all
for
here
without
stirring
a
feet
waiting
patiently
in
his
own
narrow
valley
he
also
had
attained
the
better
sunlight
the
next
day
will
made
a
sort
of
declaration
across
the
while
the
parson
was
filling
his
pipe
marjory
he
said
never
knew
any
one
i
liked
so
well
as
you
i
am
mostly
a
cold
unkindly
sort
of
man
not
from
want
of
heart
but
out
of
strangeness
in
my
way
of
thinking
and
people
seem
far
away
from
me
is
as
if
there
were
a
circle
round
me
which
kept
every
one
out
but
you
i
can
hear
the
others
talking
and
laughing
but
you
come
quite
close
maybe
this
is
disagreeable
to
you
he
asked
marjory
made
no
answer
up
girl
said
the
parson
now
returned
will
would
press
her
parson
i
feel
tied
myself
who
am
not
used
to
it
and
she
a
woman
and
little
more
than
a
child
when
all
is
said
but
for
my
part
as
far
as
i
can
understand
what
people
mean
by
it
i
fancy
i
must
be
what
they
call
in
love
i
do
not
wish
to
be
held
as
committing
myself
for
i
may
be
wrong
but
that
is
how
i
believe
things
are
with
me
and
if
miss
marjory
should
feel
any
otherwise
on
her
part
mayhap
she
would
be
so
kind
as
shake
her
head
marjory
was
silent
and
gave
no
sign
that
she
had
heard
is
that
parson
asked
will
girl
must
speak
replied
the
parson
laying
down
his
pipe
our
neighbour
who
says
he
loves
you
madge
do
you
love
him
ay
or
no
think
i
do
said
marjory
faintly
then
that
all
that
could
be
wished
cried
will
heartily
and
he
took
her
hand
across
the
table
and
held
it
a
moment
in
both
of
his
with
great
satisfaction
must
marry
observed
the
parson
replacing
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
that
the
right
thing
to
do
think
you
demanded
will
is
indispensable
said
the
parson
well
replied
the
wooer
two
or
three
days
passed
away
with
great
delight
to
will
although
a
bystander
might
scarce
have
found
it
out
he
continued
to
take
his
meals
opposite
marjory
and
to
talk
with
her
and
gaze
upon
her
in
her
presence
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
see
her
alone
nor
in
any
other
way
changed
his
conduct
towards
her
from
what
it
had
been
since
the
beginning
perhaps
the
girl
was
a
little
disappointed
and
perhaps
not
unjustly
and
yet
if
it
had
been
enough
to
be
always
in
the
thoughts
of
another
person
and
so
pervade
and
alter
his
whole
life
she
might
have
been
thoroughly
contented
for
she
was
never
out
of
will
mind
for
an
instant
he
sat
over
the
stream
and
watched
the
dust
of
the
eddy
and
the
poised
fish
and
straining
weeds
he
wandered
out
alone
into
the
purple
even
with
all
the
blackbirds
piping
round
him
in
the
wood
he
rose
early
in
the
morning
and
saw
the
sky
turn
from
grey
to
gold
and
the
light
leap
upon
the
and
all
the
while
he
kept
wondering
if
he
had
never
seen
such
things
before
or
how
it
was
that
they
should
look
so
different
now
the
sound
of
his
own
or
of
the
wind
among
the
trees
confounded
and
charmed
his
heart
the
most
enchanting
thoughts
presented
themselves
unbidden
in
his
mind
he
was
so
happy
that
he
could
not
sleep
at
night
and
so
restless
that
he
could
hardly
sit
still
out
of
her
company
and
yet
it
seemed
as
if
he
avoided
her
rather
than
sought
her
out
one
day
as
he
was
coming
home
from
a
ramble
will
found
marjory
in
the
garden
picking
flowers
and
as
he
came
up
with
her
slackened
his
pace
and
continued
walking
by
her
side
like
flowers
he
said
i
love
them
dearly
she
replied
you
no
said
he
so
much
they
are
a
very
small
affair
when
all
is
done
i
can
fancy
people
caring
for
them
greatly
but
not
doing
as
you
are
just
now
she
asked
pausing
and
looking
up
at
him
them
said
he
are
a
deal
better
off
where
they
are
and
look
a
deal
prettier
if
you
go
to
that
wish
to
have
them
for
my
own
she
answered
carry
them
near
my
heart
and
keep
them
in
my
room
they
tempt
me
when
they
grow
here
they
seem
to
say
come
and
do
something
with
us
but
once
i
have
cut
them
and
put
them
by
the
charm
is
laid
and
i
can
look
at
them
with
quite
an
easy
heart
wish
to
possess
them
replied
will
order
to
think
no
more
about
them
it
a
bit
like
killing
the
goose
with
the
golden
eggs
a
bit
like
what
i
wished
to
do
when
i
was
a
boy
because
i
had
a
fancy
for
looking
out
over
the
plain
i
wished
to
go
down
there
where
i
could
look
out
over
it
any
longer
was
not
that
fine
reasoning
dear
dear
if
they
only
thought
of
it
all
the
world
would
do
like
me
and
you
would
let
your
flowers
alone
just
as
i
stay
up
here
in
the
mountains
suddenly
he
broke
off
sharp
the
lord
he
cried
and
when
she
asked
him
what
was
wrong
he
turned
the
question
off
and
walked
away
into
the
house
with
rather
a
humorous
expression
of
face
he
was
silent
at
table
and
after
the
night
hid
fallen
and
the
stars
had
come
out
overhead
he
walked
up
and
down
for
hours
in
the
courtyard
and
garden
with
an
uneven
pace
there
was
still
a
light
in
the
window
of
marjory
room
one
little
oblong
patch
of
orange
in
a
world
of
dark
blue
hills
and
silver
starlight
will
mind
ran
a
great
deal
on
the
window
but
his
thoughts
were
not
very
she
is
in
her
room
he
thought
there
are
the
stars
overhead
a
blessing
upon
both
both
were
good
influences
in
his
life
both
soothed
and
braced
him
in
his
profound
contentment
with
the
world
and
what
more
should
he
desire
with
either
the
fat
young
man
and
his
councils
were
so
present
to
his
mind
that
he
threw
back
his
head
and
putting
his
hands
before
his
mouth
shouted
aloud
to
the
populous
heavens
whether
from
the
position
of
his
head
or
the
sudden
strain
of
the
exertion
he
seemed
to
see
a
momentary
shock
among
the
stars
and
a
diffusion
of
frosty
light
pass
from
one
to
another
along
the
sky
at
the
same
instant
a
corner
of
the
blind
was
lifted
and
lowered
again
at
once
he
laughed
a
loud
and
another
thought
will
stars
tremble
and
the
blind
goes
up
why
before
heaven
what
a
great
magician
i
must
be
now
if
i
were
only
a
fool
should
not
i
be
in
a
pretty
way
and
he
went
off
to
bed
chuckling
to
himself
i
were
only
a
fool
the
next
morning
pretty
early
he
saw
her
once
more
in
the
garden
and
sought
her
out
have
been
thinking
about
getting
married
he
began
abruptly
after
having
turned
it
all
over
i
have
made
up
my
mind
it
not
worthwhile
she
turned
upon
him
for
a
single
moment
but
his
radiant
kindly
appearance
would
under
the
circumstances
have
disconcerted
an
angel
and
she
looked
down
again
upon
the
ground
in
silence
he
could
see
her
tremble
hope
you
do
mind
he
went
on
a
little
taken
aback
ought
not
i
have
turned
it
all
over
and
upon
my
soul
there
nothing
in
it
we
should
never
be
one
whit
nearer
than
we
are
just
now
and
if
i
am
a
wise
man
nothing
like
so
happy
is
unnecessary
to
go
round
about
with
me
she
said
very
well
remember
that
you
refused
to
commit
yourself
and
now
that
i
see
you
were
mistaken
and
in
reality
have
never
cared
for
me
i
can
only
feel
sad
that
i
have
been
so
far
misled
ask
your
pardon
said
will
stoutly
do
not
understand
my
meaning
as
to
whether
i
have
ever
loved
you
or
not
i
must
leave
that
to
others
but
for
one
thing
my
feeling
is
not
changed
and
for
another
you
may
make
it
your
boast
that
you
have
made
my
whole
life
and
character
something
different
from
what
they
were
i
mean
what
i
say
no
less
i
do
not
think
getting
married
is
worth
while
i
would
rather
you
went
on
living
with
your
father
so
that
i
could
walk
over
and
see
you
once
or
maybe
twice
a
week
as
people
go
to
church
and
then
we
should
both
be
all
the
happier
between
whiles
that
my
notion
but
marry
you
if
you
will
he
added
you
know
that
you
are
insulting
me
she
broke
out
i
marjory
said
he
there
is
anything
in
a
clear
conscience
not
i
offer
all
my
heart
best
affection
you
can
take
it
or
want
it
though
i
suspect
it
beyond
either
your
power
or
mine
to
change
what
has
once
been
done
and
set
me
i
marry
you
if
you
like
but
i
tell
you
again
and
again
it
not
worth
while
and
we
had
best
stay
friends
though
i
am
a
quiet
man
i
have
noticed
a
heap
of
things
in
my
life
trust
in
me
and
take
things
as
i
propose
or
if
you
like
that
say
the
word
and
i
marry
you
out
of
hand
there
was
a
considerable
pause
and
will
who
began
to
feel
uneasy
began
to
grow
angry
in
consequence
seems
you
are
too
proud
to
say
your
mind
he
said
me
that
a
pity
a
clean
shrift
makes
simple
living
can
a
man
be
more
downright
or
honourable
to
a
woman
than
i
have
been
i
have
said
my
say
and
given
you
your
choice
do
you
want
me
to
marry
you
or
will
you
take
my
friendship
as
i
think
best
or
have
you
had
enough
of
me
for
good
speak
out
for
the
dear
god
sake
you
know
your
father
told
you
a
girl
should
speak
her
mind
in
these
affairs
she
seemed
to
recover
herself
at
that
turned
without
a
word
walked
rapidly
through
the
garden
and
disappeared
into
the
house
leaving
will
in
some
confusion
as
to
the
result
he
walked
up
and
down
the
garden
whistling
softly
to
himself
sometimes
he
stopped
and
contemplated
the
sky
and
sometimes
he
went
down
to
the
tail
of
the
weir
and
sat
there
looking
foolishly
in
the
water
all
this
dubiety
and
perturbation
was
so
foreign
to
his
nature
and
the
life
which
he
had
resolutely
chosen
for
himself
that
he
began
to
regret
marjory
arrival
all
he
thought
was
as
happy
as
a
man
need
be
i
could
come
down
here
and
watch
my
fishes
all
day
long
if
i
wanted
i
was
as
settled
and
contented
as
my
old
mill
marjory
came
down
to
dinner
looking
very
trim
and
quiet
and
no
sooner
were
all
three
at
table
than
she
made
her
father
a
speech
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
her
plate
but
showing
no
other
sign
of
embarrassment
or
distress
she
began
will
and
i
have
been
talking
things
over
we
see
that
we
have
each
made
a
mistake
about
our
feelings
and
he
has
agreed
at
my
request
to
give
up
all
idea
of
marriage
and
be
no
more
than
my
very
good
friend
as
in
the
past
you
see
there
is
no
shadow
of
a
quarrel
and
indeed
i
hope
we
shall
see
a
great
deal
of
him
in
the
future
for
his
visits
will
always
be
welcome
in
our
house
of
course
father
you
will
know
best
but
perhaps
we
should
do
better
to
leave
will
house
for
the
present
i
believe
after
what
has
passed
we
should
hardly
be
agreeable
inmates
for
some
days
will
who
had
commanded
himself
with
difficulty
from
the
first
broke
out
upon
this
into
an
inarticulate
noise
and
raised
one
hand
with
an
appearance
of
real
dismay
as
if
he
were
about
to
interfere
and
contradict
but
she
checked
him
at
once
looking
up
at
him
with
a
swift
glance
and
an
angry
flush
upon
her
cheek
will
perhaps
have
the
good
grace
she
said
let
me
explain
these
matters
for
myself
will
was
put
entirely
out
of
countenance
by
her
expression
and
the
ring
of
her
voice
he
held
his
peace
concluding
that
there
were
some
things
about
this
girl
beyond
his
comprehension
in
which
he
was
exactly
right
the
poor
parson
was
quite
crestfallen
he
tried
to
prove
that
this
was
no
more
than
a
true
lovers
tiff
which
would
pass
off
before
night
and
when
he
was
dislodged
from
that
position
he
went
on
to
argue
that
where
there
was
no
quarrel
there
could
be
no
call
for
a
separation
for
the
good
man
liked
both
his
entertainment
and
his
host
it
was
curious
to
see
how
the
girl
managed
them
saying
little
all
the
time
and
that
very
quietly
and
yet
twisting
them
round
her
finger
and
insensibly
leading
them
wherever
she
would
by
feminine
tact
and
generalship
it
scarcely
seemed
to
have
been
her
doing
it
seemed
as
if
things
had
merely
so
fallen
out
that
she
and
her
father
took
their
departure
that
same
afternoon
in
a
and
went
farther
down
the
valley
to
wait
until
their
own
house
was
ready
for
them
in
another
hamlet
but
will
had
been
observing
closely
and
was
well
aware
of
her
dexterity
and
resolution
when
he
found
himself
alone
he
had
a
great
many
curious
matters
to
turn
over
in
his
mind
he
was
very
sad
and
solitary
to
begin
with
all
the
interest
had
gone
out
of
his
life
and
he
might
look
up
at
the
stars
as
long
as
he
pleased
he
somehow
failed
to
find
support
or
consolation
and
then
he
was
in
such
a
turmoil
of
spirit
about
marjory
he
had
been
puzzled
and
irritated
at
her
behaviour
and
yet
he
could
not
keep
himself
from
admiring
it
he
thought
he
recognised
a
fine
perverse
angel
in
that
still
soul
which
he
had
never
hitherto
suspected
and
though
he
saw
it
was
an
influence
that
would
fit
but
ill
with
his
own
life
of
artificial
calm
he
could
not
keep
himself
from
ardently
desiring
to
possess
it
like
a
man
who
has
lived
among
shadows
and
now
meets
the
sun
he
was
both
pained
and
delighted
as
the
days
went
forward
he
passed
from
one
extreme
to
another
now
pluming
himself
on
the
strength
of
his
determination
now
despising
his
timid
and
silly
caution
the
former
was
perhaps
the
true
thought
of
his
heart
and
represented
the
regular
tenor
of
the
man
reflections
but
the
latter
burst
forth
from
time
to
time
with
an
unruly
violence
and
then
he
would
forget
all
consideration
and
go
up
and
down
his
house
and
garden
or
walk
among
the
like
one
who
is
beside
himself
with
remorse
to
equable
will
this
state
of
matters
was
intolerable
and
he
determined
at
whatever
cost
to
bring
it
to
an
end
so
one
warm
summer
afternoon
he
put
on
his
best
clothes
took
a
thorn
switch
in
his
hand
and
set
out
down
the
valley
by
the
river
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
his
determination
he
had
regained
at
a
bound
his
customary
peace
of
heart
and
he
enjoyed
the
bright
weather
and
the
variety
of
the
scene
without
any
admixture
of
alarm
or
unpleasant
eagerness
it
was
nearly
the
same
to
him
how
the
matter
turned
out
if
she
accepted
him
he
would
have
to
marry
her
this
time
which
perhaps
was
all
for
the
best
if
she
refused
him
he
would
have
done
his
utmost
and
might
follow
his
own
way
in
the
future
with
an
untroubled
conscience
he
hoped
on
the
whole
she
would
refuse
him
and
then
again
as
he
saw
the
brown
roof
which
sheltered
her
peeping
through
some
willows
at
an
angle
of
the
stream
he
was
half
inclined
to
reverse
the
wish
and
more
than
half
ashamed
of
himself
for
this
infirmity
of
purpose
marjory
seemed
glad
to
see
him
and
gave
him
her
hand
without
affectation
or
delay
have
been
thinking
about
this
marriage
he
began
have
i
she
answered
i
respect
you
more
and
more
for
a
very
wise
man
you
understood
me
better
than
i
understood
myself
and
i
am
now
quite
certain
that
things
are
all
for
the
best
as
they
are
the
same
time
ventured
will
must
be
tired
she
interrupted
a
seat
and
let
me
fetch
you
a
glass
of
wine
the
afternoon
is
so
warm
and
i
wish
you
not
to
be
displeased
with
your
visit
you
must
come
quite
often
once
a
week
if
you
can
spare
the
time
i
am
always
so
glad
to
see
my
friends
very
well
thought
will
to
himself
appears
i
was
right
after
all
and
he
paid
a
very
agreeable
visit
walked
home
again
in
capital
spirits
and
gave
himself
no
further
concern
about
the
matter
for
nearly
three
years
will
and
marjory
continued
on
these
terms
seeing
each
other
once
or
twice
a
week
without
any
word
of
love
between
them
and
for
all
that
time
i
believe
will
was
nearly
as
happy
as
a
man
can
be
he
rather
stinted
himself
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
and
he
would
often
walk
over
to
the
parsonage
and
then
back
again
as
if
to
whet
his
appetite
indeed
there
was
one
corner
of
the
road
whence
he
could
see
the
wedged
into
a
crevice
of
the
valley
between
sloping
firwoods
with
a
triangular
snatch
of
plain
by
way
of
background
which
he
greatly
affected
as
a
place
to
sit
and
moralise
in
before
returning
homewards
and
the
peasants
got
so
much
into
the
habit
of
finding
him
there
in
the
twilight
that
they
gave
it
the
name
of
o
the
corner
at
the
end
of
the
three
years
marjory
played
him
a
sad
trick
by
suddenly
marrying
somebody
else
will
kept
his
countenance
bravely
and
merely
remarked
that
for
as
little
as
he
knew
of
women
he
had
acted
very
prudently
in
not
marrying
her
himself
three
years
before
she
plainly
knew
very
little
of
her
own
mind
and
in
spite
of
a
deceptive
manner
was
as
fickle
and
flighty
as
the
rest
of
them
he
had
to
congratulate
himself
on
an
escape
he
said
and
would
take
a
higher
opinion
of
his
own
wisdom
in
consequence
but
at
heart
he
was
reasonably
displeased
moped
a
good
deal
for
a
month
or
two
and
fell
away
in
flesh
to
the
astonishment
of
his
it
was
perhaps
a
year
after
this
marriage
that
will
was
awakened
late
one
night
by
the
sound
of
a
horse
galloping
on
the
road
followed
by
precipitate
knocking
at
the
he
opened
his
window
and
saw
a
farm
servant
mounted
and
holding
a
led
horse
by
the
bridle
who
told
him
to
make
what
haste
he
could
and
go
along
with
him
for
marjory
was
dying
and
had
sent
urgently
to
fetch
him
to
her
bedside
will
was
no
horseman
and
made
so
little
speed
upon
the
way
that
the
poor
young
wife
was
very
near
her
end
before
he
arrived
but
they
had
some
minutes
talk
in
private
and
he
was
present
and
wept
very
bitterly
while
she
breathed
her
last
chapter
iii
death
year
after
year
went
away
into
nothing
with
great
explosions
and
outcries
in
the
cities
on
the
plain
red
revolt
springing
up
and
being
suppressed
in
blood
battle
swaying
hither
and
thither
patient
astronomers
in
observatory
towers
picking
out
and
christening
new
stars
plays
being
performed
in
lighted
theatres
people
being
carried
into
hospital
on
stretchers
and
all
the
usual
turmoil
and
agitation
of
lives
in
crowded
centres
up
in
will
valley
only
the
winds
and
seasons
made
an
epoch
the
fish
hung
in
the
swift
stream
the
birds
circled
overhead
the
rustled
underneath
the
stars
the
tall
hills
stood
over
all
and
will
went
to
and
fro
minding
his
wayside
inn
until
the
snow
began
to
thicken
on
his
head
his
heart
was
young
and
vigorous
and
if
his
pulses
kept
a
sober
time
they
still
beat
strong
and
steady
in
his
wrists
he
carried
a
ruddy
stain
on
either
cheek
like
a
ripe
apple
he
stooped
a
little
but
his
step
was
still
firm
and
his
sinewy
hands
were
reached
out
to
all
men
with
a
friendly
pressure
his
face
was
covered
with
those
wrinkles
which
are
got
in
open
air
and
which
rightly
looked
at
are
no
more
than
a
sort
of
permanent
sunburning
such
wrinkles
heighten
the
stupidity
of
stupid
faces
but
to
a
person
like
will
with
his
clear
eyes
and
smiling
mouth
only
give
another
charm
by
testifying
to
a
simple
and
easy
life
his
talk
was
full
of
wise
sayings
he
had
a
taste
for
other
people
and
other
people
had
a
taste
for
him
when
the
valley
was
full
of
tourists
in
the
season
there
were
merry
nights
in
will
arbour
and
his
views
which
seemed
whimsical
to
his
neighbours
were
often
enough
admired
by
learned
people
out
of
towns
and
colleges
indeed
he
had
a
very
noble
old
age
and
grew
daily
better
known
so
that
his
fame
was
heard
of
in
the
cities
of
the
plain
and
young
men
who
had
been
summer
travellers
spoke
together
in
of
will
o
the
mill
and
his
rough
philosophy
many
and
many
an
invitation
you
may
be
sure
he
had
but
nothing
could
tempt
him
from
his
upland
valley
he
would
shake
his
head
and
smile
over
his
with
a
deal
of
meaning
come
too
late
he
would
answer
am
a
dead
man
now
i
have
lived
and
died
already
fifty
years
ago
you
would
have
brought
my
heart
into
my
mouth
and
now
you
do
not
even
tempt
me
but
that
is
the
object
of
long
living
that
man
should
cease
to
care
about
life
and
again
is
only
one
difference
between
a
long
life
and
a
good
dinner
that
in
the
dinner
the
sweets
come
last
or
once
more
i
was
a
boy
i
was
a
bit
puzzled
and
hardly
knew
whether
it
was
myself
or
the
world
that
was
curious
and
worth
looking
into
now
i
know
it
is
myself
and
stick
to
that
he
never
showed
any
symptom
of
frailty
but
kept
stalwart
and
firm
to
the
last
but
they
say
he
grew
less
talkative
towards
the
end
and
would
listen
to
other
people
by
the
hour
in
an
amused
and
sympathetic
silence
only
when
he
did
speak
it
was
more
to
the
point
and
more
charged
with
old
experience
he
drank
a
bottle
of
wine
gladly
above
all
at
sunset
on
the
or
quite
late
at
night
under
the
stars
in
the
arbour
the
sight
of
something
attractive
and
unatttainable
seasoned
his
enjoyment
he
would
say
and
he
professed
he
had
lived
long
enough
to
admire
a
candle
all
the
more
when
he
could
compare
it
with
a
planet
one
night
in
his
year
he
awoke
in
bed
in
such
uneasiness
of
body
and
mind
that
he
arose
and
dressed
himself
and
went
out
to
meditate
in
the
arbour
it
was
pitch
dark
without
a
star
the
river
was
swollen
and
the
wet
woods
and
meadows
loaded
the
air
with
perfume
it
had
thundered
during
the
day
and
it
promised
more
thunder
for
the
morrow
a
murky
stifling
night
for
a
man
of
whether
it
was
the
weather
or
the
wakefulness
or
some
little
touch
of
fever
in
his
old
limbs
will
mind
was
besieged
by
tumultuous
and
crying
memories
his
boyhood
the
night
with
the
fat
young
man
the
death
of
his
adopted
parents
the
summer
days
with
marjory
and
many
of
those
small
circumstances
which
seem
nothing
to
another
and
are
yet
the
very
gist
of
a
man
own
life
to
himself
things
seen
words
heard
looks
misconstrued
arose
from
their
forgotten
corners
and
usurped
his
attention
the
dead
themselves
were
with
him
not
merely
taking
part
in
this
thin
show
of
memory
that
defiled
before
his
brain
but
revisiting
his
bodily
senses
as
they
do
in
profound
and
vivid
dreams
the
fat
young
man
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
opposite
marjory
came
and
went
with
an
apronful
of
flowers
between
the
garden
and
the
arbour
he
could
hear
the
old
parson
knocking
out
his
pipe
or
blowing
his
resonant
nose
the
tide
of
his
consciousness
ebbed
and
flowed
he
was
sometimes
and
drowned
in
his
recollections
of
the
past
and
sometimes
he
was
broad
awake
wondering
at
himself
but
about
the
middle
of
the
night
he
was
startled
by
the
voice
of
the
dead
miller
calling
to
him
out
of
the
house
as
he
used
to
do
on
the
arrival
of
custom
the
hallucination
was
so
perfect
that
will
sprang
from
his
seat
and
stood
listening
for
the
summons
to
be
repeated
and
as
he
listened
he
became
conscious
of
another
noise
besides
the
brawling
of
the
river
and
the
ringing
in
his
feverish
ears
it
was
like
the
stir
of
horses
and
the
creaking
of
harness
as
though
a
carriage
with
an
impatient
team
had
been
brought
up
upon
the
road
before
the
courtyard
gate
at
such
an
hour
upon
this
rough
and
dangerous
pass
the
supposition
was
no
better
than
absurd
and
will
dismissed
it
from
his
mind
and
resumed
his
seat
upon
the
arbour
chair
and
sleep
closed
over
him
again
like
running
water
he
was
once
again
awakened
by
the
dead
miller
call
thinner
and
more
spectral
than
before
and
once
again
he
heard
the
noise
of
an
equipage
upon
the
road
and
so
thrice
and
four
times
the
same
dream
or
the
same
fancy
presented
itself
to
his
senses
until
at
length
smiling
to
himself
as
when
one
humours
a
nervous
child
he
proceeded
towards
the
gate
to
set
his
uncertainty
at
rest
from
the
arbour
to
the
gate
was
no
great
distance
and
yet
it
took
will
some
time
it
seemed
as
if
the
dead
thickened
around
him
in
the
court
and
crossed
his
path
at
every
step
for
first
he
was
suddenly
surprised
by
an
overpowering
sweetness
of
heliotropes
it
was
as
if
his
garden
had
been
planted
with
this
flower
from
end
to
end
and
the
hot
damp
night
had
drawn
forth
all
their
perfumes
in
a
breath
now
the
heliotrope
had
been
marjory
favourite
flower
and
since
her
death
not
one
of
them
had
ever
been
planted
in
will
ground
must
be
going
crazy
he
thought
marjory
and
her
heliotropes
and
with
that
he
raised
his
eyes
towards
the
window
that
had
once
been
hers
if
he
had
been
bewildered
before
he
was
now
almost
terrified
for
there
was
a
light
in
the
room
the
window
was
an
orange
oblong
as
of
yore
and
the
corner
of
the
blind
was
lifted
and
let
fall
as
on
the
night
when
he
stood
and
shouted
to
the
stars
in
his
perplexity
the
illusion
only
endured
an
instant
but
it
left
him
somewhat
unmanned
rubbing
his
eyes
and
staring
at
the
outline
of
the
house
and
the
black
night
behind
it
while
he
thus
stood
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
must
have
stood
there
quite
a
long
time
there
came
a
renewal
of
the
noises
on
the
road
and
he
turned
in
time
to
meet
a
stranger
who
was
advancing
to
meet
him
across
the
court
there
was
something
like
the
outline
of
a
great
carriage
discernible
on
the
road
behind
the
stranger
and
above
that
a
few
black
like
so
many
plumes
will
asked
the
in
brief
military
fashion
same
sir
answered
will
i
do
anything
to
serve
you
have
heard
you
much
spoken
of
master
will
returned
the
other
spoken
of
and
well
and
though
i
have
both
hands
full
of
business
i
wish
to
drink
a
bottle
of
wine
with
you
in
your
arbour
before
i
go
i
shall
introduce
myself
will
led
the
way
to
the
trellis
and
got
a
lamp
lighted
and
a
bottle
uncorked
he
was
not
altogether
unused
to
such
complimentary
interviews
and
hoped
little
enough
from
this
one
being
schooled
by
many
disappointments
a
sort
of
cloud
had
settled
on
his
wits
and
prevented
him
from
remembering
the
strangeness
of
the
hour
he
moved
like
a
person
in
his
sleep
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
lamp
caught
fire
and
the
bottle
came
uncorked
with
the
facility
of
thought
still
he
had
some
curiosity
about
the
appearance
of
his
visitor
and
tried
in
vain
to
turn
the
light
into
his
face
either
he
handled
the
lamp
clumsily
or
there
was
a
dimness
over
his
eyes
but
he
could
make
out
little
more
than
a
shadow
at
table
with
him
he
stared
and
stared
at
this
shadow
as
he
wiped
out
the
glasses
and
began
to
feel
cold
and
strange
about
the
heart
the
silence
weighed
upon
him
for
he
could
hear
nothing
now
not
even
the
river
but
the
drumming
of
his
own
arteries
in
his
ears
to
you
said
the
stranger
roughly
is
my
service
sir
replied
will
sipping
his
wine
which
somehow
tasted
oddly
understand
you
are
a
very
positive
fellow
pursued
the
stranger
will
made
answer
with
a
smile
of
some
satisfaction
and
a
little
nod
am
i
continued
the
other
it
is
the
delight
of
my
heart
to
tramp
on
people
corns
i
will
have
nobody
positive
but
myself
not
one
i
have
crossed
the
whims
in
my
time
of
kings
and
generals
and
great
artists
and
what
would
you
say
he
went
on
i
had
come
up
here
on
purpose
to
cross
yours
will
had
it
on
his
tongue
to
make
a
sharp
rejoinder
but
the
politeness
of
an
old
innkeeper
prevailed
and
he
held
his
peace
and
made
answer
with
a
civil
gesture
of
the
hand
have
said
the
stranger
if
i
did
not
hold
you
in
a
particular
esteem
i
should
make
no
words
about
the
matter
it
appears
you
pride
yourself
on
staying
where
you
are
you
mean
to
stick
by
your
inn
now
i
mean
you
shall
come
for
a
turn
with
me
in
my
barouche
and
before
this
bottle
empty
so
you
shall
would
be
an
odd
thing
to
be
sure
replied
will
with
a
chuckle
sir
i
have
grown
here
like
an
old
the
devil
himself
could
hardly
root
me
up
and
for
all
i
perceive
you
are
a
very
entertaining
old
gentleman
i
would
wager
you
another
bottle
you
lose
your
pains
with
me
the
dimness
of
will
eyesight
had
been
increasing
all
this
while
but
he
was
somehow
conscious
of
a
sharp
and
chilling
scrutiny
which
irritated
and
yet
overmastered
him
need
not
think
he
broke
out
suddenly
in
an
explosive
febrile
manner
that
startled
and
alarmed
himself
i
am
a
because
i
fear
anything
under
god
god
knows
i
am
tired
enough
of
it
all
and
when
the
time
comes
for
a
longer
journey
than
ever
you
dream
of
i
reckon
i
shall
find
myself
prepared
the
stranger
emptied
his
glass
and
pushed
it
away
from
him
he
looked
down
for
a
little
and
then
leaning
over
the
table
tapped
will
three
times
upon
the
forearm
with
a
single
finger
time
has
come
he
said
solemnly
an
ugly
thrill
spread
from
the
spot
he
touched
the
tones
of
his
voice
were
dull
and
startling
and
echoed
strangely
in
will
heart
beg
your
pardon
he
said
with
some
discomposure
do
you
mean
at
me
and
you
will
find
your
eyesight
swim
raise
your
hand
it
is
this
is
your
last
bottle
of
wine
master
will
and
your
last
night
upon
the
earth
are
a
doctor
quavered
will
best
that
ever
was
replied
the
other
i
cure
both
mind
and
body
with
the
same
prescription
i
take
away
all
pain
and
i
forgive
all
sins
and
where
my
patients
have
gone
wrong
in
life
i
smooth
out
all
complications
and
set
them
free
again
upon
their
feet
have
no
need
of
you
said
will
time
comes
for
all
men
master
will
replied
the
doctor
the
helm
is
taken
out
of
their
hands
for
you
because
you
were
prudent
and
quiet
it
has
been
long
of
coming
and
you
have
had
long
to
discipline
yourself
for
its
reception
you
have
seen
what
is
to
be
seen
about
your
mill
you
have
sat
close
all
your
days
like
a
hare
in
its
form
but
now
that
is
at
an
end
and
added
the
doctor
getting
on
his
feet
must
arise
and
come
with
me
are
a
strange
physician
said
will
looking
steadfastly
upon
his
guest
am
a
natural
law
he
replied
people
call
me
death
did
you
not
tell
me
so
at
first
cried
will
have
been
waiting
for
you
these
many
years
give
me
your
hand
and
welcome
upon
my
arm
said
the
stranger
already
your
strength
abates
lean
on
me
as
heavily
as
you
need
for
though
i
am
old
i
am
very
strong
it
is
but
three
steps
to
my
carriage
and
there
all
your
trouble
ends
why
will
he
added
have
been
yearning
for
you
as
if
you
were
my
own
son
and
of
all
the
men
that
ever
i
came
for
in
my
long
days
i
have
come
for
you
most
gladly
i
am
caustic
and
sometimes
offend
people
at
first
sight
but
i
am
a
good
friend
at
heart
to
such
as
you
marjory
was
taken
returned
will
declare
before
god
you
were
the
only
friend
i
had
to
look
for
so
the
pair
went
across
the
courtyard
one
of
the
servants
awoke
about
this
time
and
heard
the
noise
of
horses
pawing
before
he
dropped
asleep
again
all
down
the
valley
that
night
there
was
a
rushing
as
of
a
smooth
and
steady
wind
descending
towards
the
plain
and
when
the
world
rose
next
morning
sure
enough
will
o
the
mill
had
gone
at
last
upon
his
travels
markheim
said
the
dealer
windfalls
are
of
various
kinds
some
customers
are
ignorant
and
then
i
touch
a
dividend
on
my
superior
knowledge
some
are
dishonest
and
here
he
held
up
the
candle
so
that
the
light
fell
strongly
on
his
visitor
in
that
case
he
continued
profit
by
my
virtue
markheim
had
but
just
entered
from
the
daylight
streets
and
his
eyes
had
not
yet
grown
familiar
with
the
mingled
shine
and
darkness
in
the
shop
at
these
pointed
words
and
before
the
near
presence
of
the
flame
he
blinked
painfully
and
looked
aside
the
dealer
chuckled
come
to
me
on
christmas
day
he
resumed
you
know
that
i
am
alone
in
my
house
put
up
my
shutters
and
make
a
point
of
refusing
business
well
you
will
have
to
pay
for
that
you
will
have
to
pay
for
my
loss
of
time
when
i
should
be
balancing
my
books
you
will
have
to
pay
besides
for
a
kind
of
manner
that
i
remark
in
you
very
strongly
i
am
the
essence
of
discretion
and
ask
no
awkward
questions
but
when
a
customer
can
not
look
me
in
the
eye
he
has
to
pay
for
it
the
dealer
once
more
chuckled
and
then
changing
to
his
usual
business
voice
though
still
with
a
note
of
irony
can
give
as
usual
a
clear
account
of
how
you
came
into
the
possession
of
the
object
he
continued
your
uncle
cabinet
a
remarkable
collector
sir
and
the
little
pale
dealer
stood
almost
on
looking
over
the
top
of
his
gold
spectacles
and
nodding
his
head
with
every
mark
of
disbelief
markheim
returned
his
gaze
with
one
of
infinite
pity
and
a
touch
of
horror
time
said
he
are
in
error
i
have
not
come
to
sell
but
to
buy
i
have
no
curios
to
dispose
of
my
uncle
cabinet
is
bare
to
the
wainscot
even
were
it
still
intact
i
have
done
well
on
the
stock
exchange
and
should
more
likely
add
to
it
than
otherwise
and
my
errand
is
simplicity
itself
i
seek
a
christmas
present
for
a
lady
he
continued
waxing
more
fluent
as
he
struck
into
the
speech
he
had
prepared
certainly
i
owe
you
every
excuse
for
thus
disturbing
you
upon
so
small
a
matter
but
the
thing
was
neglected
yesterday
i
must
produce
my
little
compliment
at
dinner
and
as
you
very
well
know
a
rich
marriage
is
not
a
thing
to
be
neglected
there
followed
a
pause
during
which
the
dealer
seemed
to
weigh
this
statement
incredulously
the
ticking
of
many
clocks
among
the
curious
lumber
of
the
shop
and
the
faint
rushing
of
the
cabs
in
a
near
thoroughfare
filled
up
the
interval
of
silence
sir
said
the
dealer
it
so
you
are
an
old
customer
after
all
and
if
as
you
say
you
have
the
chance
of
a
good
marriage
far
be
it
from
me
to
be
an
obstacle
here
is
a
nice
thing
for
a
lady
now
he
went
on
hand
glass
fifteenth
century
warranted
comes
from
a
good
collection
too
but
i
reserve
the
name
in
the
interests
of
my
customer
who
was
just
like
yourself
my
dear
sir
the
nephew
and
sole
heir
of
a
remarkable
collector
the
dealer
while
he
thus
ran
on
in
his
dry
and
biting
voice
had
stooped
to
take
the
object
from
its
place
and
as
he
had
done
so
a
shock
had
passed
through
markheim
a
start
both
of
hand
and
foot
a
sudden
leap
of
many
tumultuous
passions
to
the
face
it
passed
as
swiftly
as
it
came
and
left
no
trace
beyond
a
certain
trembling
of
the
hand
that
now
received
the
glass
glass
he
said
hoarsely
and
then
paused
and
repeated
it
more
clearly
glass
for
christmas
surely
not
why
not
cried
the
dealer
not
a
glass
markheim
was
looking
upon
him
with
an
indefinable
expression
ask
me
why
not
he
said
look
here
look
in
it
look
at
yourself
do
you
like
to
see
it
no
nor
i
nor
any
man
the
little
man
had
jumped
back
when
markheim
had
so
suddenly
confronted
him
with
the
mirror
but
now
perceiving
there
was
nothing
worse
on
hand
he
chuckled
future
lady
sir
must
be
pretty
hard
favoured
said
he
ask
you
said
markheim
a
christmas
present
and
you
give
me
this
this
damned
reminder
of
years
and
sins
and
follies
this
did
you
mean
it
had
you
a
thought
in
your
mind
tell
me
it
will
be
better
for
you
if
you
do
come
tell
me
about
yourself
i
hazard
a
guess
now
that
you
are
in
secret
a
very
charitable
man
the
dealer
looked
closely
at
his
companion
it
was
very
odd
markheim
did
not
appear
to
be
laughing
there
was
something
in
his
face
like
an
eager
sparkle
of
hope
but
nothing
of
mirth
are
you
driving
at
the
dealer
asked
charitable
returned
the
other
gloomily
not
charitable
not
pious
not
scrupulous
unloving
unbeloved
a
hand
to
get
money
a
safe
to
keep
it
is
that
all
dear
god
man
is
that
all
will
tell
you
what
it
is
began
the
dealer
with
some
sharpness
and
then
broke
off
again
into
a
chuckle
i
see
this
is
a
love
match
of
yours
and
you
have
been
drinking
the
lady
health
cried
markheim
with
a
strange
curiosity
have
you
been
in
love
tell
me
about
that
cried
the
dealer
in
love
i
never
had
the
time
nor
have
i
the
time
for
all
this
nonsense
will
you
take
the
glass
is
the
hurry
returned
markheim
is
very
pleasant
to
stand
here
talking
and
life
is
so
short
and
insecure
that
i
would
not
hurry
away
from
any
pleasure
no
not
even
from
so
mild
a
one
as
this
we
should
rather
cling
cling
to
what
little
we
can
get
like
a
man
at
a
cliff
edge
every
second
is
a
cliff
if
you
think
upon
it
a
cliff
a
mile
high
high
enough
if
we
fall
to
dash
us
out
of
every
feature
of
humanity
hence
it
is
best
to
talk
pleasantly
let
us
talk
of
each
other
why
should
we
wear
this
mask
let
us
be
confidential
who
knows
we
might
become
friends
have
just
one
word
to
say
to
you
said
the
dealer
make
your
purchase
or
walk
out
of
my
shop
true
said
markheim
fooling
to
business
show
me
something
else
the
dealer
stooped
once
more
this
time
to
replace
the
glass
upon
the
shelf
his
thin
blond
hair
falling
over
his
eyes
as
he
did
so
markheim
moved
a
little
nearer
with
one
hand
in
the
pocket
of
his
greatcoat
he
drew
himself
up
and
filled
his
lungs
at
the
same
time
many
different
emotions
were
depicted
together
on
his
face
terror
horror
and
resolve
fascination
and
a
physical
repulsion
and
through
a
haggard
lift
of
his
upper
lip
his
teeth
looked
out
perhaps
may
suit
observed
the
dealer
and
then
as
he
began
to
markheim
bounded
from
behind
upon
his
victim
the
long
skewerlike
dagger
flashed
and
fell
the
dealer
struggled
like
a
hen
striking
his
temple
on
the
shelf
and
then
tumbled
on
the
floor
in
a
heap
time
had
some
score
of
small
voices
in
that
shop
some
stately
and
slow
as
was
becoming
to
their
great
age
others
garrulous
and
hurried
all
these
told
out
the
seconds
in
an
intricate
chorus
of
tickings
then
the
passage
of
a
lad
feet
heavily
running
on
the
pavement
broke
in
upon
these
smaller
voices
and
startled
markheim
into
the
consciousness
of
his
surroundings
he
looked
about
him
awfully
the
candle
stood
on
the
counter
its
flame
solemnly
wagging
in
a
draught
and
by
that
inconsiderable
movement
the
whole
room
was
filled
with
noiseless
bustle
and
kept
heaving
like
a
sea
the
tall
shadows
nodding
the
gross
blots
of
darkness
swelling
and
dwindling
as
with
respiration
the
faces
of
the
portraits
and
the
china
gods
changing
and
wavering
like
images
in
water
the
inner
door
stood
ajar
and
peered
into
that
leaguer
of
shadows
with
a
long
slit
of
daylight
like
a
pointing
finger
from
these
rovings
markheim
eyes
returned
to
the
body
of
his
victim
where
it
lay
both
humped
and
sprawling
incredibly
small
and
strangely
meaner
than
in
life
in
these
poor
miserly
clothes
in
that
ungainly
attitude
the
dealer
lay
like
so
much
sawdust
markheim
had
feared
to
see
it
and
lo
it
was
nothing
and
yet
as
he
gazed
this
bundle
of
old
clothes
and
pool
of
blood
began
to
find
eloquent
voices
there
it
must
lie
there
was
none
to
work
the
cunning
hinges
or
direct
the
miracle
of
locomotion
there
it
must
lie
till
it
was
found
found
ay
and
then
then
would
this
dead
flesh
lift
up
a
cry
that
would
ring
over
england
and
fill
the
world
with
the
echoes
of
pursuit
ay
dead
or
not
this
was
still
the
enemy
was
that
when
the
brains
were
out
he
thought
and
the
first
word
struck
into
his
mind
time
now
that
the
deed
was
accomplished
time
which
had
closed
for
the
victim
had
become
instant
and
momentous
for
the
slayer
the
thought
was
yet
in
his
mind
when
first
one
and
then
another
with
every
variety
of
pace
and
voice
one
deep
as
the
bell
from
a
cathedral
turret
another
ringing
on
its
treble
notes
the
prelude
of
a
clocks
began
to
strike
the
hour
of
three
in
the
afternoon
the
sudden
outbreak
of
so
many
tongues
in
that
dumb
chamber
staggered
him
he
began
to
bestir
himself
going
to
and
fro
with
the
candle
beleaguered
by
moving
shadows
and
startled
to
the
soul
by
chance
reflections
in
many
rich
mirrors
some
of
home
design
some
from
venice
or
amsterdam
he
saw
his
face
repeated
and
repeated
as
it
were
an
army
of
spies
his
own
eyes
met
and
detected
him
and
the
sound
of
his
own
steps
lightly
as
they
fell
vexed
the
surrounding
quiet
and
still
as
he
continued
to
fill
his
pockets
his
mind
accused
him
with
a
sickening
iteration
of
the
thousand
faults
of
his
design
he
should
have
chosen
a
more
quiet
hour
he
should
have
prepared
an
alibi
he
should
not
have
used
a
knife
he
should
have
been
more
cautious
and
only
bound
and
gagged
the
dealer
and
not
killed
him
he
should
have
been
more
bold
and
killed
the
servant
also
he
should
have
done
all
things
otherwise
poignant
regrets
weary
incessant
toiling
of
the
mind
to
change
what
was
unchangeable
to
plan
what
was
now
useless
to
be
the
architect
of
the
irrevocable
past
meanwhile
and
behind
all
this
activity
brute
terrors
like
the
scurrying
of
rats
in
a
deserted
attic
filled
the
more
remote
chambers
of
his
brain
with
riot
the
hand
of
the
constable
would
fall
heavy
on
his
shoulder
and
his
nerves
would
jerk
like
a
hooked
fish
or
he
beheld
in
galloping
defile
the
dock
the
prison
the
gallows
and
the
black
coffin
terror
of
the
people
in
the
street
sat
down
before
his
mind
like
a
besieging
army
it
was
impossible
he
thought
but
that
some
rumour
of
the
struggle
must
have
reached
their
ears
and
set
on
edge
their
curiosity
and
now
in
all
the
neighbouring
houses
he
divined
them
sitting
motionless
and
with
uplifted
ear
solitary
people
condemned
to
spend
christmas
dwelling
alone
on
memories
of
the
past
and
now
startingly
recalled
from
that
tender
exercise
happy
family
parties
struck
into
silence
round
the
table
the
mother
still
with
raised
finger
every
degree
and
age
and
humour
but
all
by
their
own
hearths
prying
and
hearkening
and
weaving
the
rope
that
was
to
hang
him
sometimes
it
seemed
to
him
he
could
not
move
too
softly
the
clink
of
the
tall
bohemian
goblets
rang
out
loudly
like
a
bell
and
alarmed
by
the
bigness
of
the
ticking
he
was
tempted
to
stop
the
clocks
and
then
again
with
a
swift
transition
of
his
terrors
the
very
silence
of
the
place
appeared
a
source
of
peril
and
a
thing
to
strike
and
freeze
the
and
he
would
step
more
boldly
and
bustle
aloud
among
the
contents
of
the
shop
and
imitate
with
elaborate
bravado
the
movements
of
a
busy
man
at
ease
in
his
own
house
but
he
was
now
so
pulled
about
by
different
alarms
that
while
one
portion
of
his
mind
was
still
alert
and
cunning
another
trembled
on
the
brink
of
lunacy
one
hallucination
in
particular
took
a
strong
hold
on
his
credulity
the
neighbour
hearkening
with
white
face
beside
his
window
the
arrested
by
a
horrible
surmise
on
the
pavement
these
could
at
worst
suspect
they
could
not
know
through
the
brick
walls
and
shuttered
windows
only
sounds
could
penetrate
but
here
within
the
house
was
he
alone
he
knew
he
was
he
had
watched
the
servant
set
forth
in
her
poor
best
for
the
written
in
every
ribbon
and
smile
yes
he
was
alone
of
course
and
yet
in
the
bulk
of
empty
house
above
him
he
could
surely
hear
a
stir
of
delicate
footing
he
was
surely
conscious
inexplicably
conscious
of
some
presence
ay
surely
to
every
room
and
corner
of
the
house
his
imagination
followed
it
and
now
it
was
a
faceless
thing
and
yet
had
eyes
to
see
with
and
again
it
was
a
shadow
of
himself
and
yet
again
behold
the
image
of
the
dead
dealer
reinspired
with
cunning
and
hatred
at
times
with
a
strong
effort
he
would
glance
at
the
open
door
which
still
seemed
to
repel
his
eyes
the
house
was
tall
the
skylight
small
and
dirty
the
day
blind
with
fog
and
the
light
that
filtered
down
to
the
ground
story
was
exceedingly
faint
and
showed
dimly
on
the
threshold
of
the
shop
and
yet
in
that
strip
of
doubtful
brightness
did
there
not
hang
wavering
a
shadow
suddenly
from
the
street
outside
a
very
jovial
gentleman
began
to
beat
with
a
staff
on
the
accompanying
his
blows
with
shouts
and
railleries
in
which
the
dealer
was
continually
called
upon
by
name
markheim
smitten
into
ice
glanced
at
the
dead
man
but
no
he
lay
quite
still
he
was
fled
away
far
beyond
earshot
of
these
blows
and
shoutings
he
was
sunk
beneath
seas
of
silence
and
his
name
which
would
once
have
caught
his
notice
above
the
howling
of
a
storm
had
become
an
empty
sound
and
presently
the
jovial
gentleman
desisted
from
his
knocking
and
departed
here
was
a
broad
hint
to
hurry
what
remained
to
be
done
to
get
forth
from
this
accusing
neighbourhood
to
plunge
into
a
bath
of
london
multitudes
and
to
reach
on
the
other
side
of
day
that
haven
of
safety
and
apparent
innocence
his
bed
one
visitor
had
come
at
any
moment
another
might
follow
and
be
more
obstinate
to
have
done
the
deed
and
yet
not
to
reap
the
profit
would
be
too
abhorrent
a
failure
the
money
that
was
now
markheim
concern
and
as
a
means
to
that
the
keys
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
the
open
door
where
the
shadow
was
still
lingering
and
shivering
and
with
no
conscious
repugnance
of
the
mind
yet
with
a
tremor
of
the
belly
he
drew
near
the
body
of
his
victim
the
human
character
had
quite
departed
like
a
suit
with
bran
the
limbs
lay
scattered
the
trunk
doubled
on
the
floor
and
yet
the
thing
repelled
him
although
so
dingy
and
inconsiderable
to
the
eye
he
feared
it
might
have
more
significance
to
the
touch
he
took
the
body
by
the
shoulders
and
turned
it
on
its
back
it
was
strangely
light
and
supple
and
the
limbs
as
if
they
had
been
broken
fell
into
the
oddest
postures
the
face
was
robbed
of
all
expression
but
it
was
as
pale
as
wax
and
shockingly
smeared
with
blood
about
one
temple
that
was
for
markheim
the
one
displeasing
circumstance
it
carried
him
back
upon
the
instant
to
a
certain
in
a
fishers
village
a
gray
day
a
piping
wind
a
crowd
upon
the
street
the
blare
of
brasses
the
booming
of
drums
the
nasal
voice
of
a
ballad
singer
and
a
boy
going
to
and
fro
buried
over
head
in
the
crowd
and
divided
between
interest
and
fear
until
coming
out
upon
the
chief
place
of
concourse
he
beheld
a
booth
and
a
great
screen
with
pictures
dismally
designed
garishly
coloured
with
her
apprentice
the
mannings
with
their
murdered
guest
weare
in
the
of
thurtell
and
a
score
besides
of
famous
crimes
the
thing
was
as
clear
as
an
illusion
he
was
once
again
that
little
boy
he
was
looking
once
again
and
with
the
same
sense
of
physical
revolt
at
these
vile
pictures
he
was
still
stunned
by
the
thumping
of
the
drums
a
bar
of
that
day
music
returned
upon
his
memory
and
at
that
for
the
first
time
a
qualm
came
over
him
a
breath
of
nausea
a
sudden
weakness
of
the
joints
which
he
must
instantly
resist
and
conquer
he
judged
it
more
prudent
to
confront
than
to
flee
from
these
considerations
looking
the
more
hardily
in
the
dead
face
bending
his
mind
to
realise
the
nature
and
greatness
of
his
crime
so
little
a
while
ago
that
face
had
moved
with
every
change
of
sentiment
that
pale
mouth
had
spoken
that
body
had
been
all
on
fire
with
governable
energies
and
now
and
by
his
act
that
piece
of
life
had
been
arrested
as
the
horologist
with
interjected
finger
arrests
the
beating
of
the
clock
so
he
reasoned
in
vain
he
could
rise
to
no
more
remorseful
consciousness
the
same
heart
which
had
shuddered
before
the
painted
effigies
of
crime
looked
on
its
reality
unmoved
at
best
he
felt
a
gleam
of
pity
for
one
who
had
been
endowed
in
vain
with
all
those
faculties
that
can
make
the
world
a
garden
of
enchantment
one
who
had
never
lived
and
who
was
now
dead
but
of
penitence
no
not
a
tremor
with
that
shaking
himself
clear
of
these
considerations
he
found
the
keys
and
advanced
towards
the
open
door
of
the
shop
outside
it
had
begun
to
rain
smartly
and
the
sound
of
the
shower
upon
the
roof
had
banished
silence
like
some
dripping
cavern
the
chambers
of
the
house
were
haunted
by
an
incessant
echoing
which
filled
the
ear
and
mingled
with
the
ticking
of
the
clocks
and
as
markheim
approached
the
door
he
seemed
to
hear
in
answer
to
his
own
cautious
tread
the
steps
of
another
foot
withdrawing
up
the
stair
the
shadow
still
palpitated
loosely
on
the
threshold
he
threw
a
ton
weight
of
resolve
upon
his
muscles
and
drew
back
the
door
the
faint
foggy
daylight
glimmered
dimly
on
the
bare
floor
and
stairs
on
the
bright
suit
of
armour
posted
halbert
in
hand
upon
the
landing
and
on
the
dark
and
framed
pictures
that
hung
against
the
yellow
panels
of
the
wainscot
so
loud
was
the
beating
of
the
rain
through
all
the
house
that
in
markheim
ears
it
began
to
be
distinguished
into
many
different
sounds
footsteps
and
sighs
the
tread
of
regiments
marching
in
the
distance
the
chink
of
money
in
the
counting
and
the
creaking
of
doors
held
stealthily
ajar
appeared
to
mingle
with
the
patter
of
the
drops
upon
the
cupola
and
the
gushing
of
the
water
in
the
pipes
the
sense
that
he
was
not
alone
grew
upon
him
to
the
verge
of
madness
on
every
side
he
was
haunted
and
begirt
by
presences
he
heard
them
moving
in
the
upper
chambers
from
the
shop
he
heard
the
dead
man
getting
to
his
legs
and
as
he
began
with
a
great
effort
to
mount
the
stairs
feet
fled
quietly
before
him
and
followed
stealthily
behind
if
he
were
but
deaf
he
thought
how
tranquilly
he
would
possess
his
soul
and
then
again
and
hearkening
with
ever
fresh
attention
he
blessed
himself
for
that
unresting
sense
which
held
the
outposts
and
stood
a
trusty
sentinel
upon
his
life
his
head
turned
continually
on
his
neck
his
eyes
which
seemed
starting
from
their
orbits
scouted
on
every
side
and
on
every
side
were
as
with
the
tail
of
something
nameless
vanishing
the
steps
to
the
first
floor
were
agonies
on
that
first
storey
the
doors
stood
ajar
three
of
them
like
three
ambushes
shaking
his
nerves
like
the
throats
of
cannon
he
could
never
again
he
felt
be
sufficiently
immured
and
fortified
from
observing
eyes
he
longed
to
be
home
girt
in
by
walls
buried
among
bedclothes
and
invisible
to
all
but
god
and
at
that
thought
he
wondered
a
little
recollecting
tales
of
other
murderers
and
the
fear
they
were
said
to
entertain
of
heavenly
avengers
it
was
not
so
at
least
with
him
he
feared
the
laws
of
nature
lest
in
their
callous
and
immutable
procedure
they
should
preserve
some
damning
evidence
of
his
crime
he
feared
tenfold
more
with
a
slavish
superstitions
terror
some
scission
in
the
continuity
of
man
experience
some
wilful
illegality
of
nature
he
played
a
game
of
skill
depending
on
the
rules
calculating
consequence
from
cause
and
what
if
nature
as
the
defeated
tyrant
overthrew
the
should
break
the
mould
of
their
succession
the
like
had
befallen
napoleon
so
writers
said
when
the
winter
changed
the
time
of
its
appearance
the
like
might
befall
markheim
the
solid
walls
might
become
transparent
and
reveal
his
doings
like
those
of
bees
in
a
glass
hive
the
stout
planks
might
yield
under
his
foot
like
quicksands
and
detain
him
in
their
clutch
ay
and
there
were
soberer
accidents
that
might
destroy
him
if
for
instance
the
house
should
fall
and
imprison
him
beside
the
body
of
his
victim
or
the
house
next
door
should
fly
on
fire
and
the
firemen
invade
him
from
all
sides
these
things
he
feared
and
in
a
sense
these
things
might
be
called
the
hands
of
god
reached
forth
against
sin
but
about
god
himself
he
was
at
ease
his
act
was
doubtless
exceptional
but
so
were
his
excuses
which
god
knew
it
was
there
and
not
among
men
that
he
felt
sure
of
justice
when
he
had
got
safe
into
the
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
he
was
aware
of
a
respite
from
alarms
the
room
was
quite
dismantled
uncarpeted
besides
and
strewn
with
packing
cases
and
incongruous
furniture
several
great
in
which
he
beheld
himself
at
various
angles
like
an
actor
on
a
stage
many
pictures
framed
and
unframed
standing
with
their
faces
to
the
wall
a
fine
sheraton
sideboard
a
cabinet
of
marquetry
and
a
great
old
bed
with
tapestry
hangings
the
windows
opened
to
the
floor
but
by
great
good
fortune
the
lower
part
of
the
shutters
had
been
closed
and
this
concealed
him
from
the
neighbours
here
then
markheim
drew
in
a
packing
case
before
the
cabinet
and
began
to
search
among
the
keys
it
was
a
long
business
for
there
were
many
and
it
was
irksome
besides
for
after
all
there
might
be
nothing
in
the
cabinet
and
time
was
on
the
wing
but
the
closeness
of
the
occupation
sobered
him
with
the
tail
of
his
eye
he
saw
the
door
even
glanced
at
it
from
time
to
time
directly
like
a
besieged
commander
pleased
to
verify
the
good
estate
of
his
defences
but
in
truth
he
was
at
peace
the
rain
falling
in
the
street
sounded
natural
and
pleasant
presently
on
the
other
side
the
notes
of
a
piano
were
wakened
to
the
music
of
a
hymn
and
the
voices
of
many
children
took
up
the
air
and
words
how
stately
how
comfortable
was
the
melody
how
fresh
the
youthful
voices
markheim
gave
ear
to
it
smilingly
as
he
sorted
out
the
keys
and
his
mind
was
thronged
with
answerable
ideas
and
images
children
and
the
pealing
of
the
high
organ
children
afield
bathers
by
the
brookside
ramblers
on
the
brambly
common
flyers
in
the
windy
and
sky
and
then
at
another
cadence
of
the
hymn
back
again
to
church
and
the
somnolence
of
summer
sundays
and
the
high
genteel
voice
of
the
parson
which
he
smiled
a
little
to
recall
and
the
painted
jacobean
tombs
and
the
dim
lettering
of
the
ten
commandments
in
the
chancel
and
as
he
sat
thus
at
once
busy
and
absent
he
was
startled
to
his
feet
a
flash
of
ice
a
flash
of
fire
a
bursting
gush
of
blood
went
over
him
and
then
he
stood
transfixed
and
thrilling
a
step
mounted
the
stair
slowly
and
steadily
and
presently
a
hand
was
laid
upon
the
knob
and
the
lock
clicked
and
the
door
opened
fear
held
markheim
in
a
vice
what
to
expect
he
knew
not
whether
the
dead
man
walking
or
the
official
ministers
of
human
justice
or
some
chance
witness
blindly
stumbling
in
to
consign
him
to
the
gallows
but
when
a
face
was
thrust
into
the
aperture
glanced
round
the
room
looked
at
him
nodded
and
smiled
as
if
in
friendly
recognition
and
then
withdrew
again
and
the
door
closed
behind
it
his
fear
broke
loose
from
his
control
in
a
hoarse
cry
at
the
sound
of
this
the
visitant
returned
you
call
me
he
asked
pleasantly
and
with
that
he
entered
the
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
markheim
stood
and
gazed
at
him
with
all
his
eyes
perhaps
there
was
a
film
upon
his
sight
but
the
outlines
of
the
new
comer
seemed
to
change
and
waver
like
those
of
the
idols
in
the
wavering
of
the
shop
and
at
times
he
thought
he
knew
him
and
at
times
he
thought
he
bore
a
likeness
to
himself
and
always
like
a
lump
of
living
terror
there
lay
in
his
bosom
the
conviction
that
this
thing
was
not
of
the
earth
and
not
of
god
and
yet
the
creature
had
a
strange
air
of
the
commonplace
as
he
stood
looking
on
markheim
with
a
smile
and
when
he
added
are
looking
for
the
money
i
believe
it
was
in
the
tones
of
everyday
politeness
markheim
made
no
answer
should
warn
you
resumed
the
other
the
maid
has
left
her
sweetheart
earlier
than
usual
and
will
soon
be
here
if
markheim
be
found
in
this
house
i
need
not
describe
to
him
the
consequences
know
me
cried
the
murderer
the
visitor
smiled
have
long
been
a
favourite
of
mine
he
said
i
have
long
observed
and
often
sought
to
help
you
are
you
cried
markheim
devil
i
may
be
returned
the
other
can
not
affect
the
service
i
propose
to
render
you
can
cried
markheim
does
be
helped
by
you
no
never
not
by
you
you
do
not
know
me
yet
thank
god
you
do
not
know
me
know
you
replied
the
visitant
with
a
sort
of
kind
severity
or
rather
firmness
know
you
to
the
soul
me
cried
markheim
can
do
so
my
life
is
but
a
travesty
and
slander
on
myself
i
have
lived
to
belie
my
nature
all
men
do
all
men
are
better
than
this
disguise
that
grows
about
and
stifles
them
you
see
each
dragged
away
by
life
like
one
whom
bravos
have
seized
and
muffled
in
a
cloak
if
they
had
their
own
control
if
you
could
see
their
faces
they
would
be
altogether
different
they
would
shine
out
for
heroes
and
saints
i
am
worse
than
most
myself
is
more
overlaid
my
excuse
is
known
to
me
and
god
but
had
i
the
time
i
could
disclose
myself
me
inquired
the
visitant
you
before
all
returned
the
murderer
supposed
you
were
intelligent
i
thought
since
you
exist
you
would
prove
a
reader
of
the
heart
and
yet
you
would
propose
to
judge
me
by
my
acts
think
of
it
my
acts
i
was
born
and
i
have
lived
in
a
land
of
giants
giants
have
dragged
me
by
the
wrists
since
i
was
born
out
of
my
mother
the
giants
of
circumstance
and
you
would
judge
me
by
my
acts
but
can
you
not
look
within
can
you
not
understand
that
evil
is
hateful
to
me
can
you
not
see
within
me
the
clear
writing
of
conscience
never
blurred
by
any
wilful
sophistry
although
too
often
disregarded
can
you
not
read
me
for
a
thing
that
surely
must
be
common
as
humanity
the
unwilling
sinner
this
is
very
feelingly
expressed
was
the
reply
it
regards
me
not
these
points
of
consistency
are
beyond
my
province
and
i
care
not
in
the
least
by
what
compulsion
you
may
have
been
dragged
away
so
as
you
are
but
carried
in
the
right
direction
but
time
flies
the
servant
delays
looking
in
the
faces
of
the
crowd
and
at
the
pictures
on
the
hoardings
but
still
she
keeps
moving
nearer
and
remember
it
is
as
if
the
gallows
itself
was
striding
towards
you
through
the
christmas
streets
shall
i
help
you
i
who
know
all
shall
i
tell
you
where
to
find
the
money
what
price
asked
markheim
offer
you
the
service
for
a
christmas
gift
returned
the
other
markheim
could
not
refrain
from
smiling
with
a
kind
of
bitter
triumph
said
he
will
take
nothing
at
your
hands
if
i
were
dying
of
thirst
and
it
was
your
hand
that
put
the
pitcher
to
my
lips
i
should
find
the
courage
to
refuse
it
may
be
credulous
but
i
will
do
nothing
to
commit
myself
to
evil
have
no
objection
to
a
repentance
observed
the
visitant
you
disbelieve
their
efficacy
markheim
cried
do
not
say
so
returned
the
other
i
look
on
these
things
from
a
different
side
and
when
the
life
is
done
my
interest
falls
the
man
has
lived
to
serve
me
to
spread
black
looks
under
colour
of
religion
or
to
sow
tares
in
the
as
you
do
in
a
course
of
weak
compliance
with
desire
now
that
he
draws
so
near
to
his
deliverance
he
can
add
but
one
act
of
service
to
repent
to
die
smiling
and
thus
to
build
up
in
confidence
and
hope
the
more
timorous
of
my
surviving
followers
i
am
not
so
hard
a
master
try
me
accept
my
help
please
yourself
in
life
as
you
have
done
hitherto
please
yourself
more
amply
spread
your
elbows
at
the
board
and
when
the
night
begins
to
fall
and
the
curtains
to
be
drawn
i
tell
you
for
your
greater
comfort
that
you
will
find
it
even
easy
to
compound
your
quarrel
with
your
conscience
and
to
make
a
truckling
peace
with
god
i
came
but
now
from
such
a
deathbed
and
the
room
was
full
of
sincere
mourners
listening
to
the
man
last
words
and
when
i
looked
into
that
face
which
had
been
set
as
a
flint
against
mercy
i
found
it
smiling
with
hope
do
you
then
suppose
me
such
a
creature
asked
markheim
you
think
i
have
no
more
generous
aspirations
than
to
sin
and
sin
and
sin
and
at
the
last
sneak
into
heaven
my
heart
rises
at
the
thought
is
this
then
your
experience
of
mankind
or
is
it
because
you
find
me
with
red
hands
that
you
presume
such
baseness
and
is
this
crime
of
murder
indeed
so
impious
as
to
dry
up
the
very
springs
of
good
is
to
me
no
special
category
replied
the
other
sins
are
murder
even
as
all
life
is
war
i
behold
your
race
like
starving
mariners
on
a
raft
plucking
crusts
out
of
the
hands
of
famine
and
feeding
on
each
other
lives
i
follow
sins
beyond
the
moment
of
their
acting
i
find
in
all
that
the
last
consequence
is
death
and
to
my
eyes
the
pretty
maid
who
thwarts
her
mother
with
such
taking
graces
on
a
question
of
a
ball
drips
no
less
visibly
with
human
gore
than
such
a
murderer
as
yourself
do
i
say
that
i
follow
sins
i
follow
virtues
also
they
differ
not
by
the
thickness
of
a
nail
they
are
both
scythes
for
the
reaping
angel
of
death
evil
for
which
i
live
consists
not
in
action
but
in
character
the
bad
man
is
dear
to
me
not
the
bad
act
whose
fruits
if
we
could
follow
them
far
enough
down
the
hurtling
cataract
of
the
ages
might
yet
be
found
more
blessed
than
those
of
the
rarest
virtues
and
it
is
not
because
you
have
killed
a
dealer
but
because
you
are
markheim
that
i
offer
to
forward
your
escape
will
lay
my
heart
open
to
you
answered
markheim
crime
on
which
you
find
me
is
my
last
on
my
way
to
it
i
have
learned
many
lessons
itself
is
a
lesson
a
momentous
lesson
hitherto
i
have
been
driven
with
revolt
to
what
i
would
not
i
was
a
to
poverty
driven
and
scourged
there
are
robust
virtues
that
can
stand
in
these
temptations
mine
was
not
so
i
had
a
thirst
of
pleasure
but
and
out
of
this
deed
i
pluck
both
warning
and
riches
both
the
power
and
a
fresh
resolve
to
be
myself
i
become
in
all
things
a
free
actor
in
the
world
i
begin
to
see
myself
all
changed
these
hands
the
agents
of
good
this
heart
at
peace
something
comes
over
me
out
of
the
past
something
of
what
i
have
dreamed
on
sabbath
evenings
to
the
sound
of
the
church
organ
of
what
i
forecast
when
i
shed
tears
over
noble
books
or
talked
an
innocent
child
with
my
mother
there
lies
my
life
i
have
wandered
a
few
years
but
now
i
see
once
more
my
city
of
destination
are
to
use
this
money
on
the
stock
exchange
i
think
remarked
the
visitor
there
if
i
mistake
not
you
have
already
lost
some
thousands
said
markheim
this
time
i
have
a
sure
thing
time
again
you
will
lose
replied
the
visitor
quietly
but
i
keep
back
the
half
cried
markheim
also
you
will
lose
said
the
other
the
sweat
started
upon
markheim
brow
then
what
matter
he
exclaimed
it
be
lost
say
i
am
plunged
again
in
poverty
shall
one
part
of
me
and
that
the
worse
continue
until
the
end
to
override
the
better
evil
and
good
run
strong
in
me
haling
me
both
ways
i
do
not
love
the
one
thing
i
love
all
i
can
conceive
great
deeds
renunciations
martyrdoms
and
though
i
be
fallen
to
such
a
crime
as
murder
pity
is
no
stranger
to
my
thoughts
i
pity
the
poor
who
knows
their
trials
better
than
myself
i
pity
and
help
them
i
prize
love
i
love
honest
laughter
there
is
no
good
thing
nor
true
thing
on
earth
but
i
love
it
from
my
heart
and
are
my
vices
only
to
direct
my
life
and
my
virtues
to
lie
without
effect
like
some
passive
lumber
of
the
mind
not
so
good
also
is
a
spring
of
acts
but
the
visitant
raised
his
finger
years
that
you
have
been
in
this
world
said
be
many
changes
of
fortune
and
varieties
of
humour
i
have
watched
you
steadily
fall
fifteen
years
ago
you
would
have
started
at
a
theft
three
years
back
you
would
have
blenched
at
the
name
of
murder
is
there
any
crime
is
there
any
cruelty
or
meanness
from
which
you
still
recoil
five
years
from
now
i
shall
detect
you
in
the
fact
downward
downward
lies
your
way
nor
can
anything
but
death
avail
to
stop
you
is
true
markheim
said
huskily
have
in
some
degree
complied
with
evil
but
it
is
so
with
all
the
very
saints
in
the
mere
exercise
of
living
grow
less
dainty
and
take
on
the
tone
of
their
surroundings
will
propound
to
you
one
simple
question
said
the
other
as
you
answer
i
shall
read
to
you
your
moral
horoscope
you
have
grown
in
many
things
more
lax
possibly
you
do
right
to
be
so
and
at
any
account
it
is
the
same
with
all
men
but
granting
that
are
you
in
any
one
particular
however
trifling
more
difficult
to
please
with
your
own
conduct
or
do
you
go
in
all
things
with
a
looser
rein
any
one
repeated
markheim
with
an
anguish
of
consideration
he
added
with
despair
none
i
have
gone
down
in
all
said
the
visitor
yourself
with
what
you
are
for
you
will
never
change
and
the
words
of
your
part
on
this
stage
are
irrevocably
written
down
markheim
stood
for
a
long
while
silent
and
indeed
it
was
the
visitor
who
first
broke
the
silence
being
so
he
said
i
show
you
the
money
grace
cried
markheim
you
not
tried
it
returned
the
other
or
three
years
ago
did
i
not
see
you
on
the
platform
of
revival
meetings
and
was
not
your
voice
the
loudest
in
the
hymn
is
true
said
markheim
i
see
clearly
what
remains
for
me
by
way
of
duty
i
thank
you
for
these
lessons
from
my
soul
my
eyes
are
opened
and
i
behold
myself
at
last
for
what
i
am
at
this
moment
the
sharp
note
of
the
rang
through
the
house
and
the
visitant
as
though
this
were
some
concerted
signal
for
which
he
had
been
waiting
changed
at
once
in
his
demeanour
maid
he
cried
has
returned
as
i
forewarned
you
and
there
is
now
before
you
one
more
difficult
passage
her
master
you
must
say
is
ill
you
must
let
her
in
with
an
assured
but
rather
serious
countenance
no
smiles
no
overacting
and
i
promise
you
success
once
the
girl
within
and
the
door
closed
the
same
dexterity
that
has
already
rid
you
of
the
dealer
will
relieve
you
of
this
last
danger
in
your
path
thenceforward
you
have
the
whole
evening
the
whole
night
if
needful
to
ransack
the
treasures
of
the
house
and
to
make
good
your
safety
this
is
help
that
comes
to
you
with
the
mask
of
danger
up
he
cried
friend
your
life
hangs
trembling
in
the
scales
up
and
act
markheim
steadily
regarded
his
counsellor
i
be
condemned
to
evil
acts
he
said
is
still
one
door
of
freedom
open
i
can
cease
from
action
if
my
life
be
an
ill
thing
i
can
lay
it
down
though
i
be
as
you
say
truly
at
the
beck
of
every
small
temptation
i
can
yet
by
one
decisive
gesture
place
myself
beyond
the
reach
of
all
my
love
of
good
is
damned
to
barrenness
it
may
and
let
it
be
but
i
have
still
my
hatred
of
evil
and
from
that
to
your
galling
disappointment
you
shall
see
that
i
can
draw
both
energy
and
courage
the
features
of
the
visitor
began
to
undergo
a
wonderful
and
lovely
change
they
brightened
and
softened
with
a
tender
triumph
and
even
as
they
brightened
faded
and
dislimned
but
markheim
did
not
pause
to
watch
or
understand
the
transformation
he
opened
the
door
and
went
downstairs
very
slowly
thinking
to
himself
his
past
went
soberly
before
him
he
beheld
it
as
it
was
ugly
and
strenuous
like
a
dream
random
as
a
scene
of
defeat
life
as
he
thus
reviewed
it
tempted
him
no
longer
but
on
the
further
side
he
perceived
a
quiet
haven
for
his
bark
he
paused
in
the
passage
and
looked
into
the
shop
where
the
candle
still
burned
by
the
dead
body
it
was
strangely
silent
thoughts
of
the
dealer
swarmed
into
his
mind
as
he
stood
gazing
and
then
the
bell
once
more
broke
out
into
impatient
clamour
he
confronted
the
maid
upon
the
threshold
with
something
like
a
smile
had
better
go
for
the
police
said
he
have
killed
your
master
thrawn
janet
the
reverend
murdoch
soulis
was
long
minister
of
the
moorland
parish
of
balweary
in
the
vale
of
dule
a
severe
old
man
dreadful
to
his
hearers
he
dwelt
in
the
last
years
of
his
life
without
relative
or
servant
or
any
human
company
in
the
small
and
lonely
manse
under
the
hanging
shaw
in
spite
of
the
iron
composure
of
his
features
his
eye
was
wild
scared
and
uncertain
and
when
he
dwelt
in
private
admonitions
on
the
future
of
the
impenitent
it
seemed
as
if
his
eye
pierced
through
the
storms
of
time
to
the
terrors
of
eternity
many
young
persons
coming
to
prepare
themselves
against
the
season
of
the
holy
communion
were
dreadfully
affected
by
his
talk
he
had
a
sermon
on
lst
peter
and
devil
as
a
roaring
lion
on
the
sunday
after
every
seventeenth
of
august
and
he
was
accustomed
to
surpass
himself
upon
that
text
both
by
the
appalling
nature
of
the
matter
and
the
terror
of
his
bearing
in
the
pulpit
the
children
were
frightened
into
fits
and
the
old
looked
more
than
usually
oracular
and
were
all
that
day
full
of
those
hints
that
hamlet
deprecated
the
manse
itself
where
it
stood
by
the
water
of
dule
among
some
thick
trees
with
the
shaw
overhanging
it
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
many
cold
moorish
hilltops
rising
towards
the
sky
had
begun
at
a
very
early
period
of
soulis
ministry
to
be
avoided
in
the
dusk
hours
by
all
who
valued
themselves
upon
their
prudence
and
guidmen
sitting
at
the
clachan
alehouse
shook
their
heads
together
at
the
thought
of
passing
late
by
that
uncanny
neighbourhood
there
was
one
spot
to
be
more
particular
which
was
regarded
with
especial
awe
the
manse
stood
between
the
high
road
and
the
water
of
dule
with
a
gable
to
each
its
back
was
towards
the
of
balweary
nearly
half
a
mile
away
in
front
of
it
a
bare
garden
hedged
with
thorn
occupied
the
land
between
the
river
and
the
road
the
house
was
two
stories
high
with
two
large
rooms
on
each
it
opened
not
directly
on
the
garden
but
on
a
causewayed
path
or
passage
giving
on
the
road
on
the
one
hand
and
closed
on
the
other
by
the
tall
willows
and
elders
that
bordered
on
the
stream
and
it
was
this
strip
of
causeway
that
enjoyed
among
the
young
parishioners
of
balweary
so
infamous
a
reputation
the
minister
walked
there
often
after
dark
sometimes
groaning
aloud
in
the
instancy
of
his
unspoken
prayers
and
when
he
was
from
home
and
the
manse
door
was
locked
the
more
daring
schoolboys
ventured
with
beating
hearts
to
my
leader
across
that
legendary
spot
this
atmosphere
of
terror
surrounding
as
it
did
a
man
of
god
of
spotless
character
and
orthodoxy
was
a
common
cause
of
wonder
and
subject
of
inquiry
among
the
few
strangers
who
were
led
by
chance
or
business
into
that
unknown
outlying
country
but
many
even
of
the
people
of
the
parish
were
ignorant
of
the
strange
events
which
had
marked
the
first
year
of
soulis
ministrations
and
among
those
who
were
better
informed
some
were
naturally
reticent
and
others
shy
of
that
particular
topic
now
and
again
only
one
of
the
older
folk
would
warm
into
courage
over
his
third
tumbler
and
recount
the
cause
of
the
minister
strange
looks
and
solitary
life
fifty
years
syne
when
soulis
cam
first
into
he
was
still
a
young
man
a
callant
the
folk
said
fu
o
book
learnin
and
grand
at
the
exposition
but
as
was
natural
in
sae
young
a
man
wi
nae
experience
in
religion
the
younger
sort
were
greatly
taken
wi
his
gifts
and
his
gab
but
auld
concerned
serious
men
and
women
were
moved
even
to
prayer
for
the
young
man
whom
they
took
to
be
a
and
the
parish
that
was
like
to
be
sae
it
was
before
the
days
o
the
moderates
weary
fa
them
but
ill
things
are
like
guid
they
baith
come
bit
by
bit
a
pickle
at
a
time
and
there
were
folk
even
then
that
said
the
lord
had
left
the
college
professors
to
their
ain
devices
an
the
lads
that
went
to
study
wi
them
wad
hae
done
mair
and
better
sittin
in
a
like
their
forbears
of
the
persecution
wi
a
bible
under
their
oxter
and
a
speerit
o
prayer
in
their
heart
there
was
nae
doubt
onyway
but
that
soulis
had
been
ower
lang
at
the
college
he
was
careful
and
troubled
for
mony
things
besides
the
ae
thing
needful
he
had
a
feck
o
books
wi
him
mair
than
had
ever
been
seen
before
in
a
that
presbytery
and
a
sair
wark
the
carrier
had
them
for
they
were
a
like
to
have
smoored
in
the
deil
hag
between
this
and
kilmackerlie
they
were
books
o
divinity
to
be
sure
or
so
they
ca
them
but
the
serious
were
o
opinion
there
was
little
service
for
sae
mony
when
the
hail
o
god
word
would
gang
in
the
neuk
of
a
plaid
then
he
wad
sit
half
the
day
and
half
the
nicht
forbye
which
was
scant
decent
writin
nae
less
and
first
they
were
feared
he
wad
read
his
sermons
and
syne
it
proved
he
was
writin
a
book
himsel
which
was
surely
no
fittin
for
ane
of
his
years
an
sma
experience
onyway
it
behoved
him
to
get
an
auld
decent
wife
to
keep
the
manse
for
him
an
see
to
his
bit
denners
and
he
was
recommended
to
an
auld
limmer
janet
they
ca
her
and
sae
far
left
to
himsel
as
to
be
ower
persuaded
there
was
mony
advised
him
to
the
contrar
for
janet

mair
than
suspeckit
by
the
best
folk
in
lang
or
that
she
had
had
a
wean
to
a
dragoon
she
hadnae
come

for
maybe
thretty

and
bairns
had
seen

it
was
the
laird
himsel
that
had
first
tauld
the
minister
o
janet
and
in
thae
days
he
wad
have
gane
a
far
gate
to
pleesure
the
laird
when
folk
tauld
him
that
janet
was
sib
to
the
deil
it
was
a
superstition
by
his
way
of
it
an
when
they
cast
up
the
bible
to
him
an
the
witch
of
endor
he
wad
threep
it
doun
their
thrapples
that
thir
days
were
a
gane

and
the
deil
was
mercifully
restrained

when
it
got
about

the
folk
were

just
in

a
grand
voice

she
was

prayed

and
before

his
unworthy
minister
renounce
the
devil
and
his
works
weel
it
wad
appear
that
when
he
askit
that
she
gave
a
girn
that
fairly
frichtit
them
that
saw
her
an
they
could
hear
her
teeth
play
dirl
thegether
in
her
chafts
but
there
was
naething
for
it
but
the
ae
way
or
the
ither
an
janet
lifted
up
her
hand
and
renounced
the
deil
before
them
a
now
says
soulis
to
the
guidwives
with
ye
one
and
all
and
pray
to
god
for
his
forgiveness
and
he
gied
janet
his
arm
though
she
had
little
on
her
but
a
sark
and
took
her
up
the
clachan
to
her
ain
door
like
a
leddy
of
the
land
an
her
scrieghin
and
laughin
as
was
a
scandal
to
be
heard
there
were
mony
grave
folk
lang
ower
their
prayers
that
nicht
but
when
the
morn
cam
there
was
sic
a
fear
fell
upon
a
that
the
bairns
hid
theirsels
and
even
the
men
folk
stood
and
keekit
frae
their
doors
for
there
was
janet
comin
doun
the
clachan
her
or
her
likeness
nane
could
tell
wi
her
neck
thrawn
and
her
heid
on
ae
side
like
a
body
that
has
been
hangit
and
a
girn
on
her
face
like
an
unstreakit
by
an
by
they
got
used
wi
it
and
even
speered
at
her
to
ken
what
was
wrang
but
frae
that
day
forth
she
couldnae
speak
like
a
christian
woman
but
slavered
and
played
click
wi
her
teeth
like
a
pair
o
shears
and
frae
that
day
forth
the
name
o
god
cam
never
on
her
lips
whiles
she
wad
try
to
say
it
but
it
michtnae
be
them
that
kenned
best
said
least
but
they
never
gied
that
thing
the
name
o
janet
for
the
auld
janet
by
their
way
was
in
muckle
hell
that
day
but
the
minister
was
neither
to
haud
nor
to
bind
he
preached
about
naething
but
the
folk
cruelty
that
had
her
a
stroke
of
the
palsy
he
skelpt
the
bairns
that
meddled
her
and
he
had
her
up
to
the
manse
that
same
nicht
and
dwalled
there
a
his
lane
wi
her
under
the
hangin
shaw
weel
time
gaed
by
and
the
idler
sort
commenced
to
think
mair
lichtly
that
black
business
the
minister
was
weel
thocht
o
he
was
aye
late
at
the
writing
folk
wad
see
his
doon
by
the
dule
water
after
at
and
he
seemed
pleased
wi
himsel
and
upsitten
as
at
first
though
a
body
could
see
that
he
was
dwining
as
for
janet
she
cam
she
gaed
if
she
didnae
speak
muckle
afore
it
was
reason
she
should
speak
less
then
she
meddled
naebody
but
she
was
an
eldritch
thing
to
see
an
nane
wad
hae
mistrysted
wi
her
for
glebe
about
the
end
o
july
there
cam
a
spell
o
weather
the
like
never
was
in
that
country
side
it
was
lown
an
het
an
heartless
the
herds
couldnae
win
up
the
black
hill
the
bairns
were
ower
weariet
to
play
yet
it
was
gousty
too
wi
claps
o
het
wund
that
in
the
glens
and
bits
o
shouers
that
slockened
naething
we
aye
thocht
it
but
to
on
the
morn
but
the
morn
cam
an
the
morn
morning
and
it
was
aye
the
same
uncanny
weather
sair
on
folks
and
bestial
of
a
that
were
the
waur
nane
suffered
like
soulis
he
could
neither
sleep
nor
eat
he
tauld
his
elders
an
when
he
wasnae
writin
at
his
weary
book
he
wad
be
stravaguin
ower
a
the
countryside
like
a
man
possessed
when
a
body
else
was
blythe
to
keep
caller
ben

abune
hangin
shaw
in
the
bield
o
the
black
hill
there
a
bit
enclosed
grund
wi
an
iron
yett
and
it
seems
in
the
auld
days
that
was
the
kirkyaird
o
and
consecrated
by
the
papists
before
the
blessed
licht
shone
upon
the
kingdom
it
was
a
great
howff
o
soulis
onyway
there
he
would
sit
an
consider
his
sermons
and
indeed
it
a
bieldy
bit
weel
as
he
cam
ower
the
wast
end
o
the
black
hill
ae
day
he
saw
first
twa
an
syne
fower
an
syne
seeven
corbie
craws
fleein
round
an
round
abune
the
auld
kirkyaird
they
flew
laigh
and
heavy
an
squawked
to
ither
as
they
gaed
and
it
was
clear
to
soulis
that
something
had
put
them
frae
their
ordinar
he
wasnae
easy
fleyed
an
gaed
straucht
up
to
the
wa
an
what
suld
he
find
there
but
a
man
or
the
appearance
of
a
man
sittin
in
the
inside
upon
a
grave
he
was
of
a
great
stature
an
black
as
hell
and
his
were
singular
to
see
soulis
had
heard
tell
o
black
men
mony
the
time
but
there
was
something
unco
about
this
black
man
that
daunted
him
het
as
he
was
he
took
a
kind
o
cauld
grue
in
the
marrow
o
his
banes
but
up
he
spak
for
a
that
an
says
he
friend
are
you
a
stranger
in
this
place
the
black
man
answered
never
a
word
he
got
upon
his
feet
an
begude
to
hirsle
to
the
wa
on
the
far
side
but
he
aye
lookit
at
the
minister
the
minister
stood
an
lookit
back
till
a
in
a
meenute
the
black
man
was
ower
the
wa
an
rinnin
for
the
bield
o
the
trees
soulis
he
hardly
kenned
why
ran
after
him
but
he
was
sair
forjaskit
wi
his
walk
an
the
het
unhalesome
weather
and
rin
as
he
likit
he
got
nae
mair
than
a
glisk
o
the
black
man
amang
the
birks
till
he
won
doun
to
the
foot
o
the
an
there
he
saw
him
ance
mair
gaun
hap
step
an
lowp
ower

to
the
manse
soulis
wasnae
weel
pleased
that
this
fearsome
gangrel
suld
mak
sae
free
wi

an
he
ran
the
harder
an
wet
shoon
ower
the
burn
an
up
the
walk
but
the
deil
a
black
man
was
there
to
see
he
stepped
out
upon
the
road
but
there
was
naebody
there
he
gaed
a
ower
the
gairden
but
na
nae
black
man
at
the
hinder
end
and
a
bit
feared
as
was
but
natural
he
lifted
the
hasp
and
into
the
manse
and
there
was
janet
before
his
een
wi
her
thrawn
craig
and
nane
sae
pleased
to
see
him
and
he
aye
minded
sinsyne
when
first
he
set
his

says
he
if
there
was
nae
black
man
i
have
spoken
with
the
accuser
of
the
brethren
and
he
sat
down
like
ane
wi
a

an
his
teeth
chittered
in
his
heid
says
she

to
yoursel

an
no

dry
even
in

tap
o
the
simmer
for
the
manse
stands
near
the

sae
doun
he
sat
and
thocht
of
a
that
had
come
an
gane
since
he
was
in
an
his
hame
an
the
days
when
he
was
a
bairn
an
ran
daffin
on
the
braes
and
that
black
man
aye
ran
in
his
heid
like
the
of
a
sang
aye
the
mair
he
thocht
the
mair
he
thocht
o
the
black

he
tried
the
prayer
an
the
words
wouldnae
come

him
an
he
tried
they
say
to
write
at
his
book
but
he
could
nae
mak
nae
mair
o
that
there
was
whiles
he
thocht
the
black
man
was
at
his
oxter
an
the
swat
stood
upon
him
cauld
as
and
there
was
other
whiles
when
he
cam
to
himsel
like
a
christened
bairn
and
minded
naething
the
upshot
was
that
he
gaed
to
the
window
an
stood
glowrin
at
dule
water
the
trees
are
unco
thick
an
the
water
lies
deep
an
black
under
the
manse
an
there
was
janct
washin
the

her
coats
kilted
she
had
her
back
to
the

an
he
for
his
pairt
hardly
kenned
what
he
was
lookin
at
syne
she
turned
round
an
shawed
her
face
soulis
had
the
same
cauld
grue
as
twice
that
day
afore
an
it
was
borne
in
upon
him
what
folk
said
that
janet
was
deid
lang
syne
an
this
was
a
bogle
in
her
flesh
he
drew
back
a
pickle
and
he
scanned
her
narrowly
she
was
in
the
croonin
to
hersel
and
eh
gude
guide
us
but
it
was
a
fearsome
face
whiles
she
sang
louder
but
there
was
nae
man
born
o
woman
that
could
tell
the
words
o
her
sang
an
whiles
she
lookit
doun
but
there
was
naething
there
for
her
to
look
at
there
gaed
a
scunner
through
the
flesh
upon
his
banes
and
that
was
heeven
advertisement
but
soulis
just
blamed
himsel
he
said
to
think
sae
ill
of
a
puir
auld
afflicted
wife
that
hadnae
a
freend
forbye
himsel
an
he
put
up
a
bit
prayer
for
him
and
her
an
drank
a
little
caller
water
for
his
heart
rose
again
the
meat
an
gaed
up
to
his
naked
bed
in
the
gloaming
that
was
a
nicht
that
has
never
been
forgotten
in
the
nicht
the
seeventeenth
of
august
seventeen
an
twal
it
had
been
het
afore
as
i
hae
said
but
that
nicht
it
was
hetter
than
ever
the
sun
gaed
doun
amang
clouds
it
fell
as
mirk
as
the
pit
no
a
star
no
a
breath
o
wund
ye
couldnae
see
your
han
afore
your
face
and
even
the
auld
folk
cuist
the
covers
frae
their
beds
and
lay
pechin
for
their
breath
wi
a
that
he
had
upon
his
mind
it
was
gey
and
unlikely
soulis
wad
get
muckle
sleep
he
lay
an
he
tummled
the
gude
caller
bed
that
he
got
into
brunt
his
very
banes
whiles
he
slept
and
whiles
he
waukened
whiles
he
heard
the
time
o
nicht
and
whiles
a
tyke
yowlin
up
the
muir
as
if
somebody
was
deid
whiles
he
thocht
he
heard
bogles
claverin
in
his
lug
an
whiles
he
saw
spunkies
in
the
room
he
behoved
he
judged
to
be
sick
an
sick
he
was
little
he
jaloosed
the
sickness
at
the
hinder
end
he
got
a
clearness
in
his
mind
sat
up
in
his
sark
on
the
and
fell
thinkin
ance
mair
o
the
black
man
an
janet
he
couldnae
weel
tell
how
maybe
it
was
the
cauld
to
his
feet
but
it
in
upon
him
wi
a
spate
that
there
was
some
connection
between
thir
twa
an
that
either
or
baith
o
them
were
bogles
and
just
at
that
moment
in
janet
room
which
was
neist
to
his
there
cam
a
stramp
o
feet
as
if
men
were
an
then
a
loud
bang
an
then
a
wund
gaed
reishling
round
the
fower
quarters
of
the
house
an
then
a
was
aince
mair
as
seelent
as
the
grave
soulis
was
feared
for
neither
man
nor
deevil
he
got
his
an
lit
a
an
made
three
steps
ower
to
janet
door
it
was
on
the
hasp
an
he
pushed
it
open
an
keeked
bauldly
in
it
was
a
big
room
as
big
as
the
minister
ain
an
plenished
wi
grand
auld
solid
gear
for
he
had
naething
else
there
was
a
bed
wi
auld
tapestry
and
a
braw
cabinet
of
aik
that
was
fu
o
the
divinity
books
an
put
there
to
be
out
o
the

an
a
wheen
duds
janet
lying
here
and
there
about
the

but
nae
janet
could
soulis
see
nor
ony
sign
of
a
contention
in
he
gaed
an
there
few
that
wad
followed
him
an
lookit
a
round
an
listened
but
there
was
naethin
to
be
heard
neither
inside
the
manse
nor
in
a
parish
an
naethin
to
be
seen
but
the
muckle
shadows
turnin
round
the
an
then
a
at
aince
the
minister
heart
played
dunt
an
stood
an
a
cauld
wund
blew
amang
the
hairs
o
his

whaten
a
weary
sicht
was
that
for
the

for
there
was

clear
abune

forgive
us
all
thocht
soulis
janet
dead
he
cam
a
step
nearer
to
the
corp
an
then
his
heart
fair
whammled
in
his
inside
for
by
what
cantrip
it
wad
a

to
judge
she
was
hingin
frae
a

it
an
awfu
thing
to
be
your

at
nicht
wi
siccan
prodigies
darkness
but
soulis
was
strong
in
the
lord
he
turned
an
gaed
his

oot
o
that
room
and
lockit
the
door
ahint
him
and
step
by
step
doon
the
stairs
as
heavy
as
leed
and
set
doon
the
on
the
table
at
the
stairfoot
he
couldnae
pray
he
couldnae
think
he
was

an
naething
could
he
hear
but
the
his
ain
heart
he
micht
maybe
have
stood
there
an
hour
or
maybe
twa
he
minded
sae
little
when
a
o
a
sudden
he
heard
a
laigh
uncanny
steer
upstairs
a
foot
gaed
to
an
fro
in
the
whaur
the
corp
was
hingin
syne
the
door
was
opened
though
he
minded
weel
that
he
had
lockit
it
an
syne
there
was
a
step
upon
the
landin
an
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
corp
was
lookin
ower
the
rail
and
doun
upon
him
whaur
he
stood
he
took
up
the

for
he
couldnae

and
as
saftly
as
ever
he
could
gaed
straucht
out
o
the
manse
an
to
the
far
end
o
the
causeway
it
was
aye
the
flame
o
the
when
he

there
little

it
was
him
that
dwalled

lang
in

body
but
he
was
awa
at
last
and
sinsyne
the
deil
has
never
fashed
us
in
but
it
was
a
sair
dispensation
for
the
minister
lang
lang
he
lay
in
his
bed
and
frae
that
hour
to
this
he
was
the
man
ye
ken
the
day
olalla
said
the
doctor
part
is
done
and
i
may
say
with
some
vanity
well
done
it
remains
only
to
get
you
out
of
this
cold
and
poisonous
city
and
to
give
you
two
months
of
a
pure
air
and
an
easy
conscience
the
last
is
your
affair
to
the
first
i
think
i
can
help
you
it
fells
indeed
rather
oddly
it
was
but
the
other
day
the
padre
came
in
from
the
country
and
as
he
and
i
are
old
friends
although
of
contrary
professions
he
applied
to
me
in
a
matter
of
distress
among
some
of
his
parishioners
this
was
a
family
but
you
are
ignorant
of
spain
and
even
the
names
of
our
grandees
are
hardly
known
to
you
suffice
it
then
that
they
were
once
great
people
and
are
now
fallen
to
the
brink
of
destitution
nothing
now
belongs
to
them
but
the
residencia
and
certain
leagues
of
desert
mountain
in
the
greater
part
of
which
not
even
a
goat
could
support
life
but
the
house
is
a
fine
old
place
and
stands
at
a
great
height
among
the
hills
and
most
salubriously
and
i
had
no
sooner
heard
my
friend
tale
than
i
remembered
you
i
told
him
i
had
a
wounded
officer
wounded
in
the
good
cause
who
was
now
able
to
make
a
change
and
i
proposed
that
his
friends
should
take
you
for
a
lodger
instantly
the
padre
face
grew
dark
as
i
had
maliciously
foreseen
it
would
it
was
out
of
the
question
he
said
then
let
them
starve
said
i
for
i
have
no
sympathy
with
tatterdemalion
pride
we
separated
not
very
content
with
one
another
but
yesterday
to
my
wonder
the
padre
returned
and
made
a
submission
the
difficulty
he
said
he
had
found
upon
enquiry
to
be
less
than
he
had
feared
or
in
other
words
these
proud
people
had
put
their
pride
in
their
pocket
i
closed
with
the
offer
and
subject
to
your
approval
i
have
taken
rooms
for
you
in
the
residencia
the
air
of
these
mountains
will
renew
your
blood
and
the
quiet
in
which
you
will
there
live
is
worth
all
the
medicines
in
the
world
said
i
have
been
throughout
my
good
angel
and
your
advice
is
a
command
but
tell
me
if
you
please
something
of
the
family
with
which
i
am
to
reside
am
coming
to
that
replied
my
friend
indeed
there
is
a
difficulty
in
the
way
these
beggars
are
as
i
have
said
of
very
high
descent
and
swollen
with
the
most
baseless
vanity
they
have
lived
for
some
generations
in
a
growing
isolation
drawing
away
on
either
hand
from
the
rich
who
had
now
become
too
high
for
them
and
from
the
poor
whom
they
still
regarded
as
too
low
and
even
when
poverty
forces
them
to
unfasten
their
door
to
a
guest
they
can
not
do
so
without
a
most
ungracious
stipulation
you
are
to
remain
they
say
a
stranger
they
will
give
you
attendance
but
they
refuse
from
the
first
the
idea
of
the
smallest
intimacy
i
will
not
deny
that
i
was
piqued
and
perhaps
the
feeling
strengthened
my
desire
to
go
for
i
was
confident
that
i
could
break
down
that
barrier
if
i
desired
is
nothing
offensive
in
such
a
stipulation
said
i
i
even
sympathise
with
the
feeling
that
inspired
it
is
true
they
have
never
seen
you
returned
the
doctor
politely
if
they
knew
you
were
the
handsomest
and
the
most
pleasant
man
that
ever
came
from
england
where
i
am
told
that
handsome
men
are
common
but
pleasant
ones
not
so
much
so
they
would
doubtless
make
you
welcome
with
a
better
grace
but
since
you
take
the
thing
so
well
it
matters
not
to
me
indeed
it
seems
discourteous
but
you
will
find
yourself
the
gainer
the
family
will
not
much
tempt
you
a
mother
a
son
and
a
daughter
an
old
woman
said
to
be
halfwitted
a
country
lout
and
a
country
girl
who
stands
very
high
with
her
confessor
and
is
therefore
chuckled
the
physician
likely
plain
there
is
not
much
in
that
to
attract
the
fancy
of
a
dashing
officer
yet
you
say
they
are
i
objected
as
to
that
i
should
distinguish
returned
the
doctor
mother
is
not
so
the
children
the
mother
was
the
last
representative
of
a
princely
stock
degenerate
both
in
parts
and
fortune
her
father
was
not
only
poor
he
was
mad
and
the
girl
ran
wild
about
the
residencia
till
his
death
then
much
of
the
fortune
having
died
with
him
and
the
family
being
quite
extinct
the
girl
ran
wilder
than
ever
until
at
last
she
married
heaven
knows
whom
a
muleteer
some
say
others
a
smuggler
while
there
are
some
who
uphold
there
was
no
marriage
at
all
and
that
felipe
and
olalla
are
bastards
the
union
such
as
it
was
was
tragically
dissolved
some
years
ago
but
they
live
in
such
seclusion
and
the
country
at
that
time
was
in
so
much
disorder
that
the
precise
manner
of
the
man
end
is
known
only
to
the
priest
if
even
to
him
begin
to
think
i
shall
have
strange
experiences
said
i
would
not
romance
if
i
were
you
replied
the
doctor
will
find
i
fear
a
very
grovelling
and
commonplace
reality
felipe
for
instance
i
have
seen
and
what
am
i
to
say
he
is
very
rustic
very
cunning
very
loutish
and
i
should
say
an
innocent
the
others
are
probably
to
match
no
no
senor
commandante
you
must
seek
congenial
society
among
the
great
sights
of
our
mountains
and
in
these
at
least
if
you
are
at
all
a
lover
of
the
works
of
nature
i
promise
you
will
not
be
disappointed
the
next
day
felipe
came
for
me
in
a
rough
country
cart
drawn
by
a
mule
and
a
little
before
the
stroke
of
noon
after
i
had
said
farewell
to
the
doctor
the
innkeeper
and
different
good
souls
who
had
befriended
me
during
my
sickness
we
set
forth
out
of
the
city
by
the
eastern
gate
and
began
to
ascend
into
the
sierra
i
had
been
so
long
a
prisoner
since
i
was
left
behind
for
dying
after
the
loss
of
the
convoy
that
the
mere
smell
of
the
earth
set
me
smiling
the
country
through
which
we
went
was
wild
and
rocky
partially
covered
with
rough
woods
now
of
the
and
now
of
the
great
spanish
chestnut
and
frequently
intersected
by
the
beds
of
mountain
torrents
the
sun
shone
the
wind
rustled
joyously
and
we
had
advanced
some
miles
and
the
city
had
already
shrunk
into
an
inconsiderable
knoll
upon
the
plain
behind
us
before
my
attention
began
to
be
diverted
to
the
companion
of
my
drive
to
the
eye
he
seemed
but
a
diminutive
loutish
country
lad
such
as
the
doctor
had
described
mighty
quick
and
active
but
devoid
of
any
culture
and
this
first
impression
was
with
most
observers
final
what
began
to
strike
me
was
his
familiar
chattering
talk
so
strangely
inconsistent
with
the
terms
on
which
i
was
to
be
received
and
partly
from
his
imperfect
enunciation
partly
from
the
sprightly
incoherence
of
the
matter
so
very
difficult
to
follow
clearly
without
an
effort
of
the
mind
it
is
true
i
had
before
talked
with
persons
of
a
similar
mental
constitution
persons
who
seemed
to
live
as
he
did
by
the
senses
taken
and
possessed
by
the
visual
object
of
the
moment
and
unable
to
discharge
their
minds
of
that
impression
his
seemed
to
me
as
i
sat
distantly
giving
ear
a
kind
of
conversation
proper
to
drivers
who
pass
much
of
their
time
in
a
great
vacancy
of
the
intellect
and
threading
the
sights
of
a
familiar
country
but
this
was
not
the
case
of
felipe
by
his
own
account
he
was
a
keeper
wish
i
was
there
now
he
said
and
then
spying
a
tree
by
the
wayside
he
broke
off
to
tell
me
that
he
had
once
seen
a
crow
among
its
branches
crow
i
repeated
struck
by
the
ineptitude
of
the
remark
and
thinking
i
had
heard
imperfectly
but
by
this
time
he
was
already
filled
with
a
new
idea
hearkening
with
a
rapt
intentness
his
head
on
one
side
his
face
puckered
and
he
struck
me
rudely
to
make
me
hold
my
peace
then
he
smiled
and
shook
his
head
did
you
hear
i
asked
it
is
all
right
he
said
and
began
encouraging
his
mule
with
cries
that
echoed
unhumanly
up
the
mountain
walls
i
looked
at
him
more
closely
he
was
superlatively
light
and
lithe
and
strong
he
was
his
yellow
eyes
were
very
large
though
perhaps
not
very
expressive
take
him
altogether
he
was
a
lad
and
i
had
no
fault
to
find
with
him
beyond
that
he
was
of
a
dusky
hue
and
inclined
to
hairyness
two
characteristics
that
i
disliked
it
was
his
mind
that
puzzled
and
yet
attracted
me
the
doctor
phrase
an
innocent
came
back
to
me
and
i
was
wondering
if
that
were
after
all
the
true
description
when
the
road
began
to
go
down
into
the
narrow
and
naked
chasm
of
a
torrent
the
waters
thundered
tumultuously
in
the
bottom
and
the
ravine
was
filled
full
of
the
sound
the
thin
spray
and
the
claps
of
wind
that
accompanied
their
descent
the
scene
was
certainly
impressive
but
the
road
was
in
that
part
very
securely
walled
in
the
mule
went
steadily
forward
and
i
was
astonished
to
perceive
the
paleness
of
terror
in
the
face
of
my
companion
the
voice
of
that
wild
river
was
inconstant
now
sinking
lower
as
if
in
weariness
now
doubling
its
hoarse
tones
momentary
freshets
seemed
to
swell
its
volume
sweeping
down
the
gorge
raving
and
booming
against
the
barrier
walls
and
i
observed
it
was
at
each
of
these
accessions
to
the
clamour
that
my
driver
more
particularly
winced
and
blanched
some
thoughts
of
scottish
superstition
and
the
river
kelpie
passed
across
my
mind
i
wondered
if
perchance
the
like
were
prevalent
in
that
part
of
spain
and
turning
to
felipe
sought
to
draw
him
out
is
the
matter
i
asked
i
am
afraid
he
replied
what
are
you
afraid
i
returned
seems
one
of
the
safest
places
on
this
very
dangerous
road
makes
a
noise
he
said
with
a
simplicity
of
awe
that
set
my
doubts
at
rest
the
lad
was
but
a
child
in
intellect
his
mind
was
like
his
body
active
and
swift
but
stunted
in
development
and
i
began
from
that
time
forth
to
regard
him
with
a
measure
of
pity
and
to
listen
at
first
with
indulgence
and
at
last
even
with
pleasure
to
his
disjointed
babble
by
about
four
in
the
afternoon
we
had
crossed
the
summit
of
the
mountain
line
said
farewell
to
the
western
sunshine
and
began
to
go
down
upon
the
other
side
skirting
the
edge
of
many
ravines
and
moving
through
the
shadow
of
dusky
woods
there
rose
upon
all
sides
the
voice
of
falling
water
not
condensed
and
formidable
as
in
the
gorge
of
the
river
but
scattered
and
sounding
gaily
and
musically
from
glen
to
glen
here
too
the
spirits
of
my
driver
mended
and
he
began
to
sing
aloud
in
a
falsetto
voice
and
with
a
singular
bluntness
of
musical
perception
never
true
either
to
melody
or
key
but
wandering
at
will
and
yet
somehow
with
an
effect
that
was
natural
and
pleasing
like
that
of
the
of
birds
as
the
dusk
increased
i
fell
more
and
more
under
the
spell
of
this
artless
warbling
listening
and
waiting
for
some
articulate
air
and
still
disappointed
and
when
at
last
i
asked
him
what
it
was
he
sang
cried
he
am
just
singing
above
all
i
was
taken
with
a
trick
he
had
of
unweariedly
repeating
the
same
note
at
little
intervals
it
was
not
so
monotonous
as
you
would
think
or
at
least
not
disagreeable
and
it
seemed
to
breathe
a
wonderful
contentment
with
what
is
such
as
we
love
to
fancy
in
the
attitude
of
trees
or
the
quiescence
of
a
pool
night
had
fallen
dark
before
we
came
out
upon
a
plateau
and
drew
up
a
little
after
before
a
certain
lump
of
superior
blackness
which
i
could
only
conjecture
to
be
the
residencia
here
my
guide
getting
down
from
the
cart
hooted
and
whistled
for
a
long
time
in
vain
until
at
last
an
old
peasant
man
came
towards
us
from
somewhere
in
the
surrounding
dark
carrying
a
candle
in
his
hand
by
the
light
of
this
i
was
able
to
perceive
a
great
arched
doorway
of
a
moorish
character
it
was
closed
by
gates
in
one
of
the
leaves
of
which
felipe
opened
a
wicket
the
peasant
carried
off
the
cart
to
some
but
my
guide
and
i
passed
through
the
wicket
which
was
closed
again
behind
us
and
by
the
glimmer
of
the
candle
passed
through
a
court
up
a
stone
stair
along
a
section
of
an
open
gallery
and
up
more
stairs
again
until
we
came
at
last
to
the
door
of
a
great
and
somewhat
bare
apartment
this
room
which
i
understood
was
to
be
mine
was
pierced
by
three
windows
lined
with
some
lustrous
wood
disposed
in
panels
and
carpeted
with
the
skins
of
many
savage
animals
a
bright
fire
burned
in
the
chimney
and
shed
abroad
a
changeful
flicker
close
up
to
the
blaze
there
was
drawn
a
table
laid
for
supper
and
in
the
far
end
a
bed
stood
ready
i
was
pleased
by
these
preparations
and
said
so
to
felipe
and
he
with
the
same
simplicity
of
disposition
that
i
held
already
remarked
in
him
warmly
my
praises
fine
room
he
said
very
fine
room
and
fire
too
fire
is
good
it
melts
out
the
pleasure
in
your
bones
and
the
bed
he
continued
carrying
over
the
candle
in
that
direction
what
fine
sheets
how
soft
how
smooth
smooth
and
he
passed
his
hand
again
and
again
over
their
texture
and
then
laid
down
his
head
and
rubbed
his
cheeks
among
them
with
a
grossness
of
content
that
somehow
offended
me
i
took
the
candle
from
his
hand
for
i
feared
he
would
set
the
bed
on
fire
and
walked
back
to
the
where
perceiving
a
measure
of
wine
i
poured
out
a
cup
and
called
to
him
to
come
and
drink
of
it
he
started
to
his
feet
at
once
and
ran
to
me
with
a
strong
expression
of
hope
but
when
he
saw
the
wine
he
visibly
shuddered
no
he
said
that
that
is
for
you
i
hate
it
well
senor
said
i
i
will
drink
to
your
good
health
and
to
the
prosperity
of
your
house
and
family
speaking
of
which
i
added
after
i
had
drunk
i
not
have
the
pleasure
of
laying
my
salutations
in
person
at
the
feet
of
the
senora
your
mother
but
at
these
words
all
the
childishness
passed
out
of
his
face
and
was
succeeded
by
a
look
of
indescribable
cunning
and
secrecy
he
backed
away
from
me
at
the
same
time
as
though
i
were
an
animal
about
to
leap
or
some
dangerous
fellow
with
a
weapon
and
when
he
had
got
near
the
door
glowered
at
me
sullenly
with
contracted
pupils
he
said
at
last
and
the
next
moment
was
gone
noiselessly
out
of
the
room
and
i
heard
his
footing
die
away
downstairs
as
light
as
rainfall
and
silence
closed
over
the
house
after
i
had
supped
i
drew
up
the
table
nearer
to
the
bed
and
began
to
prepare
for
rest
but
in
the
new
position
of
the
light
i
was
struck
by
a
picture
on
the
wall
it
represented
a
woman
still
young
to
judge
by
her
costume
and
the
mellow
unity
which
reigned
over
the
canvas
she
had
long
been
dead
to
judge
by
the
vivacity
of
the
attitude
the
eyes
and
the
features
i
might
have
been
beholding
in
a
mirror
the
image
of
life
her
figure
was
very
slim
and
strong
and
of
a
just
proportion
red
tresses
lay
like
a
crown
over
her
brow
her
eyes
of
a
very
golden
brown
held
mine
with
a
look
and
her
face
which
was
perfectly
shaped
was
yet
marred
by
a
cruel
sullen
and
sensual
expression
something
in
both
face
and
figure
something
exquisitely
intangible
like
the
echo
of
an
echo
suggested
the
features
and
bearing
of
my
guide
and
i
stood
awhile
unpleasantly
attracted
and
wondering
at
the
oddity
of
the
resemblance
the
common
carnal
stock
of
that
race
which
had
been
originally
designed
for
such
high
dames
as
the
one
now
looking
on
me
from
the
canvas
had
fallen
to
baser
uses
wearing
country
clothes
sitting
on
the
shaft
and
holding
the
reins
of
a
mule
cart
to
bring
home
a
lodger
perhaps
an
actual
link
subsisted
perhaps
some
scruple
of
the
delicate
flesh
that
was
once
clothed
upon
with
the
satin
and
brocade
of
the
dead
lady
now
winced
at
the
rude
contact
of
felipe
frieze
the
first
light
of
the
morning
shone
full
upon
the
portrait
and
as
i
lay
awake
my
eyes
continued
to
dwell
upon
it
with
growing
complacency
its
beauty
crept
about
my
heart
insidiously
silencing
my
scruples
one
after
another
and
while
i
knew
that
to
love
such
a
woman
were
to
sign
and
seal
one
own
sentence
of
degeneration
i
still
knew
that
if
she
were
alive
i
should
love
her
day
after
day
the
double
knowledge
of
her
wickedness
and
of
my
weakness
grew
clearer
she
came
to
be
the
heroine
of
many
in
which
her
eyes
led
on
to
and
sufficiently
rewarded
crimes
she
cast
a
dark
shadow
on
my
fancy
and
when
i
was
out
in
the
free
air
of
heaven
taking
vigorous
exercise
and
healthily
renewing
the
current
of
my
blood
it
was
often
a
glad
thought
to
me
that
my
enchantress
was
safe
in
the
grave
her
wand
of
beauty
broken
her
lips
closed
in
silence
her
philtre
spilt
and
yet
i
had
a
terror
that
she
might
not
be
dead
after
all
but
in
the
body
of
some
descendant
felipe
served
my
meals
in
my
own
apartment
and
his
resemblance
to
the
portrait
haunted
me
at
times
it
was
not
at
times
upon
some
change
of
attitude
or
flash
of
expression
it
would
leap
out
upon
me
like
a
ghost
it
was
above
all
in
his
ill
tempers
that
the
likeness
triumphed
he
certainly
liked
me
he
was
proud
of
my
notice
which
he
sought
to
engage
by
many
simple
and
childlike
devices
he
loved
to
sit
close
before
my
fire
talking
his
broken
talk
or
singing
his
odd
endless
wordless
songs
and
sometimes
drawing
his
hand
over
my
clothes
with
an
affectionate
manner
of
caressing
that
never
failed
to
cause
in
me
an
embarrassment
of
which
i
was
ashamed
but
for
all
that
he
was
capable
of
flashes
of
causeless
anger
and
fits
of
sturdy
sullenness
at
a
word
of
reproof
i
have
seen
him
upset
the
dish
of
which
i
was
about
to
eat
and
this
not
surreptitiously
but
with
defiance
and
similarly
at
a
hint
of
inquisition
i
was
not
unnaturally
curious
being
in
a
strange
place
and
surrounded
by
staring
people
but
at
the
shadow
of
a
question
he
shrank
back
lowering
and
dangerous
then
it
was
that
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
this
rough
lad
might
have
been
the
brother
of
the
lady
in
the
frame
but
these
humours
were
swift
to
pass
and
the
resemblance
died
along
with
them
in
these
first
days
i
saw
nothing
of
any
one
but
felipe
unless
the
portrait
is
to
be
counted
and
since
the
lad
was
plainly
of
weak
mind
and
had
moments
of
passion
it
may
be
wondered
that
i
bore
his
dangerous
neighbourhood
with
equanimity
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
for
some
time
irksome
but
it
happened
before
long
that
i
obtained
over
him
so
complete
a
mastery
as
set
my
disquietude
at
rest
it
fell
in
this
way
he
was
by
nature
slothful
and
much
of
a
vagabond
and
yet
he
kept
by
the
house
and
not
only
waited
upon
my
wants
but
laboured
every
day
in
the
garden
or
small
farm
to
the
south
of
the
residencia
here
he
would
be
joined
by
the
peasant
whom
i
had
seen
on
the
night
of
my
arrival
and
who
dwelt
at
the
far
end
of
the
enclosure
about
half
a
mile
away
in
a
rude
but
it
was
plain
to
me
that
of
these
two
it
was
felipe
who
did
most
and
though
i
would
sometimes
see
him
throw
down
his
spade
and
go
to
sleep
among
the
very
plants
he
had
been
digging
his
constancy
and
energy
were
admirable
in
themselves
and
still
more
so
since
i
was
well
assured
they
were
foreign
to
his
disposition
and
the
fruit
of
an
ungrateful
effort
but
while
i
admired
i
wondered
what
had
called
forth
in
a
lad
so
this
enduring
sense
of
duty
how
was
it
sustained
i
asked
myself
and
to
what
length
did
it
prevail
over
his
instincts
the
priest
was
possibly
his
inspirer
but
the
priest
came
one
day
to
the
residencia
i
saw
him
both
come
and
go
after
an
interval
of
close
upon
an
hour
from
a
knoll
where
i
was
sketching
and
all
that
time
felipe
continued
to
labour
undisturbed
in
the
garden
at
last
in
a
very
unworthy
spirit
i
determined
to
debauch
the
lad
from
his
good
resolutions
and
him
at
the
gate
easily
pursuaded
him
to
join
me
in
a
ramble
it
was
a
fine
day
and
the
woods
to
which
i
led
him
were
green
and
pleasant
and
and
alive
with
the
hum
of
insects
here
he
discovered
himself
in
a
fresh
character
mounting
up
to
heights
of
gaiety
that
abashed
me
and
displaying
an
energy
and
grace
of
movement
that
delighted
the
eye
he
leaped
he
ran
round
me
in
mere
glee
he
would
stop
and
look
and
listen
and
seem
to
drink
in
the
world
like
a
cordial
and
then
he
would
suddenly
spring
into
a
tree
with
one
bound
and
hang
and
gambol
there
like
one
at
home
little
as
he
said
to
me
and
that
of
not
much
import
i
have
rarely
enjoyed
more
stirring
company
the
sight
of
his
delight
was
a
continual
feast
the
speed
and
accuracy
of
his
movements
pleased
me
to
the
heart
and
i
might
have
been
so
thoughtlessly
unkind
as
to
make
a
habit
of
these
wants
had
not
chance
prepared
a
very
rude
conclusion
to
my
pleasure
by
some
swiftness
or
dexterity
the
lad
captured
a
squirrel
in
a
tree
top
he
was
then
some
way
ahead
of
me
but
i
saw
him
drop
to
the
ground
and
crouch
there
crying
aloud
for
pleasure
like
a
child
the
sound
stirred
my
sympathies
it
was
so
fresh
and
innocent
but
as
i
bettered
my
pace
to
draw
near
the
cry
of
the
squirrel
knocked
upon
my
heart
i
have
heard
and
seen
much
of
the
cruelty
of
lads
and
above
all
of
peasants
but
what
i
now
beheld
struck
me
into
a
passion
of
anger
i
thrust
the
fellow
aside
plucked
the
poor
brute
out
of
his
hands
and
with
swift
mercy
killed
it
then
i
turned
upon
the
torturer
spoke
to
him
long
out
of
the
heat
of
my
indignation
calling
him
names
at
which
he
seemed
to
wither
and
at
length
pointing
toward
the
residencia
bade
him
begone
and
leave
me
for
i
chose
to
walk
with
men
not
with
vermin
he
fell
upon
his
knees
and
the
words
coming
to
him
with
more
cleanness
than
usual
poured
out
a
stream
of
the
most
touching
supplications
begging
me
in
mercy
to
forgive
him
to
forget
what
he
had
done
to
look
to
the
future
i
try
so
hard
he
said
commandante
bear
with
felipe
this
once
he
will
never
be
a
brute
again
thereupon
much
more
affected
than
i
cared
to
show
i
suffered
myself
to
be
persuaded
and
at
last
shook
hands
with
him
and
made
it
up
but
the
squirrel
by
way
of
penance
i
made
him
bury
speaking
of
the
poor
thing
beauty
telling
him
what
pains
it
had
suffered
and
how
base
a
thing
was
the
abuse
of
strength
felipe
said
i
are
strong
indeed
but
in
my
hands
you
are
as
helpless
as
that
poor
thing
of
the
trees
give
me
your
hand
in
mine
you
can
not
remove
it
now
suppose
that
i
were
cruel
like
you
and
took
a
pleasure
in
pain
i
only
tighten
my
hold
and
see
how
you
suffer
he
screamed
aloud
his
face
stricken
ashy
and
dotted
with
needle
points
of
sweat
and
when
i
set
him
free
he
fell
to
the
earth
and
nursed
his
hand
and
moaned
over
it
like
a
baby
but
he
took
the
lesson
in
good
part
and
whether
from
that
or
from
what
i
had
said
to
him
or
the
higher
notion
he
now
had
of
my
bodily
strength
his
original
affection
was
changed
into
a
like
adoring
fidelity
meanwhile
i
gained
rapidly
in
health
the
residencia
stood
on
the
crown
of
a
stony
plateau
on
every
side
the
mountains
hemmed
it
about
only
from
the
roof
where
was
a
bartizan
there
might
be
seen
between
two
peaks
a
small
segment
of
plain
blue
with
extreme
distance
the
air
in
these
altitudes
moved
freely
and
largely
great
clouds
congregated
there
and
were
broken
up
by
the
wind
and
left
in
tatters
on
the
hilltops
a
hoarse
and
yet
faint
rumbling
of
torrents
rose
from
all
round
and
one
could
there
study
all
the
ruder
and
more
ancient
characters
of
nature
in
something
of
their
pristine
force
i
delighted
from
the
first
in
the
vigorous
scenery
and
changeful
weather
nor
less
in
the
antique
and
dilapidated
mansion
where
i
dwelt
this
was
a
large
oblong
flanked
at
two
opposite
corners
by
projections
one
of
which
commanded
the
door
while
both
were
loopholed
for
musketry
the
lower
storey
was
besides
naked
of
windows
so
that
the
building
if
garrisoned
could
not
be
carried
without
artillery
it
enclosed
an
open
court
planted
with
pomegranate
trees
from
this
a
broad
flight
of
marble
stairs
ascended
to
an
open
gallery
running
all
round
and
resting
towards
the
court
on
slender
pillars
thence
again
several
enclosed
stairs
led
to
the
upper
storeys
of
the
house
which
were
thus
broken
up
into
distinct
divisions
the
windows
both
within
and
without
were
closely
shuttered
some
of
the
in
the
upper
parts
had
fallen
the
roof
in
one
place
had
been
wrecked
in
one
of
the
flurries
of
wind
which
were
common
in
these
mountains
and
the
whole
house
in
the
strong
beating
sunlight
and
standing
out
above
a
grove
of
stunted
thickly
laden
and
discoloured
with
dust
looked
like
the
sleeping
palace
of
the
legend
the
court
in
particular
seemed
the
very
home
of
slumber
a
hoarse
cooing
of
doves
haunted
about
the
eaves
the
winds
were
excluded
but
when
they
blew
outside
the
mountain
dust
fell
here
as
thick
as
rain
and
veiled
the
red
bloom
of
the
pomegranates
shuttered
windows
and
the
closed
doors
of
numerous
cellars
and
the
vacant
arches
of
the
gallery
enclosed
it
and
all
day
long
the
sun
made
broken
profiles
on
the
four
sides
and
paraded
the
shadow
of
the
pillars
on
the
gallery
floor
at
the
ground
level
there
was
however
a
certain
pillared
recess
which
bore
the
marks
of
human
habitation
though
it
was
open
in
front
upon
the
court
it
was
yet
provided
with
a
chimney
where
a
wood
fire
would
he
always
prettily
blazing
and
the
tile
floor
was
littered
with
the
skins
of
animals
it
was
in
this
place
that
i
first
saw
my
hostess
she
had
drawn
one
of
the
skins
forward
and
sat
in
the
sun
leaning
against
a
pillar
it
was
her
dress
that
struck
me
first
of
all
for
it
was
rich
and
brightly
coloured
and
shone
out
in
that
dusty
courtyard
with
something
of
the
same
relief
as
the
flowers
of
the
pomegranates
at
a
second
look
it
was
her
beauty
of
person
that
took
hold
of
me
as
she
sat
back
watching
me
i
thought
though
with
invisible
eyes
and
wearing
at
the
same
time
an
expression
of
almost
imbecile
and
contentment
she
showed
a
perfectness
of
feature
and
a
quiet
nobility
of
attitude
that
were
beyond
a
statue
i
took
off
my
hat
to
her
in
passing
and
her
face
puckered
with
suspicion
as
swiftly
and
lightly
as
a
pool
ruffles
in
the
breeze
but
she
paid
no
heed
to
my
courtesy
i
went
forth
on
my
customary
walk
a
trifle
daunted
her
impassivity
haunting
me
and
when
i
returned
although
she
was
still
in
much
the
same
posture
i
was
half
surprised
to
see
that
she
had
moved
as
far
as
the
next
pillar
following
the
sunshine
this
time
however
she
addressed
me
with
some
trivial
salutation
civilly
enough
conceived
and
uttered
in
the
same
and
yet
indistinct
and
lisping
tones
that
had
already
baffled
the
utmost
niceness
of
my
hearing
from
her
son
i
answered
rather
at
a
venture
for
not
only
did
i
fail
to
take
her
meaning
with
precision
but
the
sudden
disclosure
of
her
eyes
disturbed
me
they
were
unusually
large
the
iris
golden
like
felipe
but
the
pupil
at
that
moment
so
distended
that
they
seemed
almost
black
and
what
affected
me
was
not
so
much
their
size
as
what
was
perhaps
its
consequence
the
singular
insignificance
of
their
regard
a
look
more
blankly
stupid
i
have
never
met
my
eyes
dropped
before
it
even
as
i
spoke
and
i
went
on
my
way
upstairs
to
my
own
room
at
once
baffled
and
embarrassed
yet
when
i
came
there
and
saw
the
face
of
the
portrait
i
was
again
reminded
of
the
miracle
of
family
descent
my
hostess
was
indeed
both
older
and
fuller
in
person
her
eyes
were
of
a
different
colour
her
face
besides
was
not
only
free
from
the
that
offended
and
attracted
me
in
the
painting
it
was
devoid
of
either
good
or
bad
a
moral
blank
expressing
literally
naught
and
yet
there
was
a
likeness
not
so
much
speaking
as
immanent
not
so
much
in
any
particular
feature
as
upon
the
whole
it
should
seem
i
thought
as
if
when
the
master
set
his
signature
to
that
grave
canvas
he
had
not
only
caught
the
image
of
one
smiling
and
woman
but
stamped
the
essential
quality
of
a
race
from
that
day
forth
whether
i
came
or
went
i
was
sure
to
find
the
senora
seated
in
the
sun
against
a
pillar
or
stretched
on
a
rug
before
the
fire
only
at
times
she
would
shift
her
station
to
the
top
round
of
the
stone
staircase
where
she
lay
with
the
same
nonchalance
right
across
my
path
in
all
these
days
i
never
knew
her
to
display
the
least
spark
of
energy
beyond
what
she
expended
in
brushing
and
her
copious
hair
or
in
lisping
out
in
the
rich
and
broken
hoarseness
of
her
voice
her
customary
idle
salutations
to
myself
these
i
think
were
her
two
chief
pleasures
beyond
that
of
mere
quiescence
she
seemed
always
proud
of
her
remarks
as
though
they
had
been
witticisms
and
indeed
though
they
were
empty
enough
like
the
conversation
of
many
respectable
persons
and
turned
on
a
very
narrow
range
of
subjects
they
were
never
meaningless
or
incoherent
nay
they
had
a
certain
beauty
of
their
own
breathing
as
they
did
of
her
entire
contentment
now
she
would
speak
of
the
warmth
in
which
like
her
son
she
greatly
delighted
now
of
the
flowers
of
the
pomegranate
trees
and
now
of
the
white
doves
and
swallows
that
fanned
the
air
of
the
court
the
birds
excited
her
as
they
raked
the
eaves
in
their
swift
flight
or
skimmed
sidelong
past
her
with
a
rush
of
wind
she
would
sometimes
stir
and
sit
a
little
up
and
seem
to
awaken
from
her
doze
of
satisfaction
but
for
the
rest
of
her
days
she
lay
luxuriously
folded
on
herself
and
sunk
in
sloth
and
pleasure
her
invincible
content
at
first
annoyed
me
but
i
came
gradually
to
find
repose
in
the
spectacle
until
at
last
it
grew
to
be
my
habit
to
sit
down
beside
her
four
times
in
the
day
both
coming
and
going
and
to
talk
with
her
sleepily
i
scarce
knew
of
what
i
had
come
to
like
her
dull
almost
animal
neighbourhood
her
beauty
and
her
stupidity
soothed
and
amused
me
i
began
to
find
a
kind
of
transcendental
good
sense
in
her
remarks
and
her
unfathomable
good
nature
moved
me
to
admiration
and
envy
the
liking
was
returned
she
enjoyed
my
presence
as
a
man
in
deep
meditation
may
enjoy
the
babbling
of
a
brook
i
can
scarce
say
she
brightened
when
i
came
for
satisfaction
was
written
on
her
face
eternally
as
on
some
foolish
statue
but
i
was
made
conscious
of
her
pleasure
by
some
more
intimate
communication
than
the
sight
and
one
day
as
i
set
within
reach
of
her
on
the
marble
step
she
suddenly
shot
forth
one
of
her
hands
and
patted
mine
the
thing
was
done
and
she
was
back
in
her
accustomed
attitude
before
my
mind
had
received
intelligence
of
the
caress
and
when
i
turned
to
look
her
in
the
face
i
could
perceive
no
answerable
sentiment
it
was
plain
she
attached
no
moment
to
the
act
and
i
blamed
myself
for
my
own
more
uneasy
consciousness
the
sight
and
if
i
may
so
call
it
the
acquaintance
of
the
mother
confirmed
the
view
i
had
already
taken
of
the
son
the
family
blood
had
been
impoverished
perhaps
by
long
inbreeding
which
i
knew
to
be
a
common
error
among
the
proud
and
the
exclusive
no
decline
indeed
was
to
be
traced
in
the
body
which
had
been
handed
down
unimpaired
in
shapeliness
and
strength
and
the
faces
of
were
struck
as
sharply
from
the
mint
as
the
face
of
two
centuries
ago
that
smiled
upon
me
from
the
portrait
but
the
intelligence
that
more
precious
heirloom
was
degenerate
the
treasure
of
ancestral
memory
ran
low
and
it
had
required
the
potent
plebeian
crossing
of
a
muleteer
or
mountain
contrabandista
to
raise
what
approached
hebetude
in
the
mother
into
the
active
oddity
of
the
son
yet
of
the
two
it
was
the
mother
i
preferred
of
felipe
vengeful
and
placable
full
of
starts
and
shyings
inconstant
as
a
hare
i
could
even
conceive
as
a
creature
possibly
noxious
of
the
mother
i
had
no
thoughts
but
those
of
kindness
and
indeed
as
spectators
are
apt
ignorantly
to
take
sides
i
grew
something
of
a
partisan
in
the
enmity
which
i
perceived
to
smoulder
between
them
true
it
seemed
mostly
on
the
mother
part
she
would
sometimes
draw
in
her
breath
as
he
came
near
and
the
pupils
of
her
vacant
eyes
would
contract
as
if
with
horror
or
fear
her
emotions
such
as
they
were
were
much
upon
the
surface
and
readily
shared
and
this
latent
repulsion
occupied
my
mind
and
kept
me
wondering
on
what
grounds
it
rested
and
whether
the
son
was
certainly
in
fault
i
had
been
about
ten
days
in
the
residencia
when
there
sprang
up
a
high
and
harsh
wind
carrying
clouds
of
dust
it
came
out
of
malarious
lowlands
and
over
several
snowy
sierras
the
nerves
of
those
on
whom
it
blew
were
strung
and
jangled
their
eyes
smarted
with
the
dust
their
legs
ached
under
the
burthen
of
their
body
and
the
touch
of
one
hand
upon
another
grew
to
be
odious
the
wind
besides
came
down
the
gullies
of
the
hills
and
stormed
about
the
house
with
a
great
hollow
buzzing
and
whistling
that
was
wearisome
to
the
ear
and
dismally
depressing
to
the
mind
it
did
not
so
much
blow
in
gusts
as
with
the
steady
sweep
of
a
waterfall
so
that
there
was
no
remission
of
discomfort
while
it
blew
but
higher
upon
the
mountain
it
was
probably
of
a
more
variable
strength
with
accesses
of
fury
for
there
came
down
at
times
a
wailing
infinitely
grievous
to
hear
and
at
times
on
one
of
the
high
shelves
or
terraces
there
would
start
up
and
then
disperse
a
tower
of
dust
like
the
smoke
of
in
explosion
i
no
sooner
awoke
in
bed
than
i
was
conscious
of
the
nervous
tension
and
depression
of
the
weather
and
the
effect
grew
stronger
as
the
day
proceeded
it
was
in
vain
that
i
resisted
in
vain
that
i
set
forth
upon
my
customary
morning
walk
the
irrational
unchanging
fury
of
the
storm
had
soon
beat
down
my
strength
and
wrecked
my
temper
and
i
returned
to
the
residencia
glowing
with
dry
heat
and
foul
and
gritty
with
dust
the
court
had
a
forlorn
appearance
now
and
then
a
glimmer
of
sun
fled
over
it
now
and
then
the
wind
swooped
down
upon
the
pomegranates
and
scattered
the
blossoms
and
set
the
window
shutters
clapping
on
the
wall
in
the
recess
the
senora
was
pacing
to
and
fro
with
a
flushed
countenance
and
bright
eyes
i
thought
too
she
was
speaking
to
herself
like
one
in
anger
but
when
i
addressed
her
with
my
customary
salutation
she
only
replied
by
a
sharp
gesture
and
continued
her
walk
the
weather
had
distempered
even
this
impassive
creature
and
as
i
went
on
upstairs
i
was
the
less
ashamed
of
my
own
discomposure
all
day
the
wind
continued
and
i
sat
in
my
room
and
made
a
feint
of
reading
or
walked
up
and
down
and
listened
to
the
riot
overhead
night
fell
and
i
had
not
so
much
as
a
candle
i
began
to
long
for
some
society
and
stole
down
to
the
court
it
was
now
plunged
in
the
blue
of
the
first
darkness
but
the
recess
was
redly
lighted
by
the
fire
the
wood
had
been
piled
high
and
was
crowned
by
a
shock
of
flames
which
the
draught
of
the
chimney
brandished
to
and
fro
in
this
strong
and
shaken
brightness
the
senora
continued
pacing
from
wall
to
wall
with
disconnected
gestures
clasping
her
hands
stretching
forth
her
arms
throwing
back
her
head
as
in
appeal
to
heaven
in
these
disordered
movements
the
beauty
and
grace
of
the
woman
showed
more
clearly
but
there
was
a
light
in
her
eye
that
struck
on
me
unpleasantly
and
when
i
had
looked
on
awhile
in
silence
and
seemingly
unobserved
i
turned
tail
as
i
had
come
and
groped
my
way
back
again
to
my
own
chamber
by
the
time
felipe
brought
my
supper
and
lights
my
nerve
was
utterly
gone
and
had
the
lad
been
such
as
i
was
used
to
seeing
him
i
should
have
kept
him
even
by
force
had
that
been
necessary
to
take
off
the
edge
from
my
distasteful
solitude
but
on
felipe
also
the
wind
had
exercised
its
influence
he
had
been
feverish
all
day
now
that
the
night
had
come
he
was
fallen
into
a
low
and
tremulous
humour
that
reacted
on
my
own
the
sight
of
his
scared
face
his
starts
and
pallors
and
sudden
harkenings
unstrung
me
and
when
he
dropped
and
broke
a
dish
i
fairly
leaped
out
of
my
seat
think
we
are
all
mad
said
i
affecting
to
laugh
is
the
black
wind
he
replied
dolefully
feel
as
if
you
must
do
something
and
you
do
know
what
it
is
i
noted
the
aptness
of
the
description
but
indeed
felipe
had
sometimes
a
strange
felicity
in
rendering
into
words
the
sensations
of
the
body
your
mother
too
said
i
seems
to
feel
this
weather
much
do
you
not
fear
she
may
be
unwell
he
stared
at
me
a
little
and
then
said
almost
defiantly
and
the
next
moment
carrying
his
hand
to
his
brow
cried
out
lamentably
on
the
wind
and
the
noise
that
made
his
head
go
round
like
a
millwheel
can
be
well
he
cried
and
indeed
i
could
only
echo
his
question
for
i
was
disturbed
enough
myself
i
went
to
bed
early
wearied
with
restlessness
but
the
poisonous
nature
of
the
wind
and
its
ungodly
and
unintermittent
uproar
would
not
suffer
me
to
sleep
i
lay
there
and
tossed
my
nerves
and
senses
on
the
stretch
at
times
i
would
doze
dream
horribly
and
wake
again
and
these
snatches
of
oblivion
confused
me
as
to
time
but
it
must
have
been
late
on
in
the
night
when
i
was
suddenly
startled
by
an
outbreak
of
pitiable
and
hateful
cries
i
leaped
from
my
bed
supposing
i
had
dreamed
but
the
cries
still
continued
to
fill
the
house
cries
of
pain
i
thought
but
certainly
of
rage
also
and
so
savage
and
discordant
that
they
shocked
the
heart
it
was
no
illusion
some
living
thing
some
lunatic
or
some
wild
animal
was
being
foully
tortured
the
thought
of
felipe
and
the
squirrel
flashed
into
my
mind
and
i
ran
to
the
door
but
it
had
been
locked
from
the
outside
and
i
might
shake
it
as
i
pleased
i
was
a
fast
prisoner
still
the
cries
continued
now
they
would
dwindle
down
into
a
moaning
that
seemed
to
be
articulate
and
at
these
times
i
made
sure
they
must
be
human
and
again
they
would
break
forth
and
fill
the
house
with
ravings
worthy
of
hell
i
stood
at
the
door
and
gave
ear
to
them
till
at
last
they
died
away
long
after
that
i
still
lingered
and
still
continued
to
hear
them
mingle
in
fancy
with
the
storming
of
the
wind
and
when
at
last
i
crept
to
my
bed
it
was
with
a
deadly
sickness
and
a
blackness
of
horror
on
my
heart
it
was
little
wonder
if
i
slept
no
more
why
had
i
been
locked
in
what
had
passed
who
was
the
author
of
these
indescribable
and
shocking
cries
a
human
being
it
was
inconceivable
a
beast
the
cries
were
scarce
quite
bestial
and
what
animal
short
of
a
lion
or
a
tiger
could
thus
shake
the
solid
walls
of
the
residencia
and
while
i
was
thus
turning
over
the
elements
of
the
mystery
it
came
into
my
mind
that
i
had
not
yet
set
eyes
upon
the
daughter
of
the
house
what
was
more
probable
than
that
the
daughter
of
the
senora
and
the
sister
of
felipe
should
be
herself
insane
or
what
more
likely
than
that
these
ignorant
and
witted
people
should
seek
to
manage
an
afflicted
kinswoman
by
violence
here
was
a
solution
and
yet
when
i
called
to
mind
the
cries
which
i
never
did
without
a
shuddering
chill
it
seemed
altogether
insufficient
not
even
cruelty
could
wring
such
cries
from
madness
but
of
one
thing
i
was
sure
i
could
not
live
in
a
house
where
such
a
thing
was
half
conceivable
and
not
probe
the
matter
home
and
if
necessary
interfere
the
next
day
came
the
wind
had
blown
itself
out
and
there
was
nothing
to
remind
me
of
the
business
of
the
night
felipe
came
to
my
bedside
with
obvious
cheerfulness
as
i
passed
through
the
court
the
senora
was
sunning
herself
with
her
accustomed
immobility
and
when
i
issued
from
the
gateway
i
found
the
whole
face
of
nature
austerely
smiling
the
heavens
of
a
cold
blue
and
sown
with
great
cloud
islands
and
the
mapped
forth
into
provinces
of
light
and
shadow
a
short
walk
restored
me
to
myself
and
renewed
within
me
the
resolve
to
plumb
this
mystery
and
when
from
the
vantage
of
my
knoll
i
had
seen
felipe
pass
forth
to
his
labours
in
the
garden
i
returned
at
once
to
the
residencia
to
put
my
design
in
practice
the
senora
appeared
plunged
in
slumber
i
stood
awhile
and
marked
her
but
she
did
not
stir
even
if
my
design
were
indiscreet
i
had
little
to
fear
from
such
a
guardian
and
turning
away
i
mounted
to
the
gallery
and
began
my
exploration
of
the
house
all
morning
i
went
from
one
door
to
another
and
entered
spacious
and
faded
chambers
some
rudely
shuttered
some
receiving
their
full
charge
of
daylight
all
empty
and
unhomely
it
was
a
rich
house
on
which
time
had
breathed
his
tarnish
and
dust
had
scattered
disillusion
the
spider
swung
there
the
bloated
tarantula
scampered
on
the
cornices
ants
had
their
crowded
highways
on
the
floor
of
halls
of
audience
the
big
and
foul
fly
that
lives
on
carrion
and
is
often
the
messenger
of
death
had
set
up
his
nest
in
the
rotten
woodwork
and
buzzed
heavily
about
the
rooms
here
and
there
a
stool
or
two
a
couch
a
bed
or
a
great
carved
chair
remained
behind
like
islets
on
the
bare
floors
to
testify
of
man
bygone
habitation
and
everywhere
the
walls
were
set
with
the
portraits
of
the
dead
i
could
judge
by
these
decaying
effigies
in
the
house
of
what
a
great
and
what
a
handsome
race
i
was
then
wandering
many
of
the
men
wore
orders
on
their
breasts
and
had
the
port
of
noble
offices
the
women
were
all
richly
attired
the
canvases
most
of
them
by
famous
hands
but
it
was
not
so
much
these
evidences
of
greatness
that
took
hold
upon
my
mind
even
contrasted
as
they
were
with
the
present
depopulation
and
decay
of
that
great
house
it
was
rather
the
parable
of
family
life
that
i
read
in
this
succession
of
fair
faces
and
shapely
bodies
never
before
had
i
so
realised
the
miracle
of
the
continued
race
the
creation
and
recreation
the
weaving
and
changing
and
handing
down
of
fleshly
elements
that
a
child
should
be
born
of
its
mother
that
it
should
grow
and
clothe
itself
we
know
not
how
with
humanity
and
put
on
inherited
looks
and
turn
its
head
with
the
manner
of
one
ascendant
and
offer
its
hand
with
the
gesture
of
another
are
wonders
dulled
for
us
by
repetition
but
in
the
singular
unity
of
look
in
the
common
features
and
common
bearing
of
all
these
painted
generations
on
the
walls
of
the
residencia
the
miracle
started
out
and
looked
me
in
the
face
and
an
ancient
mirror
falling
opportunely
in
my
way
i
stood
and
read
my
own
features
a
long
while
tracing
out
on
either
hand
the
filaments
of
descent
and
the
bonds
that
knit
me
with
my
family
at
last
in
the
course
of
these
investigations
i
opened
the
door
of
a
chamber
that
bore
the
marks
of
habitation
it
was
of
large
proportions
and
faced
to
the
north
where
the
mountains
were
most
wildly
figured
the
embers
of
a
fire
smouldered
and
smoked
upon
the
hearth
to
which
a
chair
had
been
drawn
close
and
yet
the
aspect
of
the
chamber
was
ascetic
to
the
degree
of
sternness
the
chair
was
uncushioned
the
floor
and
walls
were
naked
and
beyond
the
books
which
lay
here
and
there
in
some
confusion
there
was
no
instrument
of
either
work
or
pleasure
the
sight
of
books
in
the
house
of
such
a
family
exceedingly
amazed
me
and
i
began
with
a
great
hurry
and
in
momentary
fear
of
interruption
to
go
from
one
to
another
and
hastily
inspect
their
character
they
were
of
all
sorts
devotional
historical
and
scientific
but
mostly
of
a
great
age
and
in
the
latin
tongue
some
i
could
see
to
bear
the
marks
of
constant
study
others
had
been
torn
across
and
tossed
aside
as
if
in
petulance
or
disapproval
lastly
as
i
cruised
about
that
empty
chamber
i
espied
some
papers
written
upon
with
pencil
on
a
table
near
the
window
an
unthinking
curiosity
led
me
to
take
one
up
it
bore
a
copy
of
verses
very
roughly
metred
in
the
original
spanish
and
which
i
may
render
somewhat
thus
pleasure
approached
with
pain
and
shame
grief
with
a
wreath
of
lilies
came
pleasure
showed
the
lovely
sun
jesu
dear
how
sweet
it
shone
grief
with
her
worn
hand
pointed
on
jesu
dear
to
thee
shame
and
confusion
at
once
fell
on
me
and
laying
down
the
paper
i
beat
an
immediate
retreat
from
the
apartment
neither
felipe
nor
his
mother
could
have
read
the
books
nor
written
these
rough
but
feeling
verses
it
was
plain
i
had
stumbled
with
sacrilegious
feet
into
the
room
of
the
daughter
of
the
house
god
knows
my
own
heart
most
sharply
punished
me
for
my
indiscretion
the
thought
that
i
had
thus
secretly
pushed
my
way
into
the
confidence
of
a
girl
so
strangely
situated
and
the
fear
that
she
might
somehow
come
to
hear
of
it
oppressed
me
like
guilt
i
blamed
myself
besides
for
my
suspicions
of
the
night
before
wondered
that
i
should
ever
have
attributed
those
shocking
cries
to
one
of
whom
i
now
conceived
as
of
a
saint
spectral
of
mien
wasted
with
maceration
bound
up
in
the
practices
of
a
mechanical
devotion
and
dwelling
in
a
great
isolation
of
soul
with
her
incongruous
relatives
and
as
i
leaned
on
the
balustrade
of
the
gallery
and
looked
down
into
the
bright
close
of
pomegranates
and
at
the
gaily
dressed
and
somnolent
woman
who
just
then
stretched
herself
and
delicately
licked
her
lips
as
in
the
very
sensuality
of
sloth
my
mind
swiftly
compared
the
scene
with
the
cold
chamber
looking
northward
on
the
mountains
where
the
daughter
dwelt
that
same
afternoon
as
i
sat
upon
my
knoll
i
saw
the
padre
enter
the
gates
of
the
residencia
the
revelation
of
the
daughter
character
had
struck
home
to
my
fancy
and
almost
blotted
out
the
horrors
of
the
night
before
but
at
sight
of
this
worthy
man
the
memory
revived
i
descended
then
from
the
knoll
and
making
a
circuit
among
the
woods
posted
myself
by
the
wayside
to
await
his
passage
as
soon
as
he
appeared
i
stepped
forth
and
introduced
myself
as
the
lodger
of
the
residencia
he
had
a
very
strong
honest
countenance
on
which
it
was
easy
to
read
the
mingled
emotions
with
which
he
regarded
me
as
a
foreigner
a
heretic
and
yet
one
who
had
been
wounded
for
the
good
cause
of
the
family
at
the
residencia
he
spoke
with
reserve
and
yet
with
respect
i
mentioned
that
i
had
not
yet
seen
the
daughter
whereupon
he
remarked
that
that
was
as
it
should
be
and
looked
at
me
a
little
askance
lastly
i
plucked
up
courage
to
refer
to
the
cries
that
had
disturbed
me
in
the
night
he
heard
me
out
in
silence
and
then
stopped
and
partly
turned
about
as
though
to
mark
beyond
doubt
that
he
was
dismissing
me
you
take
tobacco
powder
said
he
offering
his
and
then
when
i
had
refused
am
an
old
man
he
added
i
may
be
allowed
to
remind
you
that
you
are
a
guest
have
then
your
authority
i
returned
firmly
enough
although
i
flushed
at
the
implied
reproof
let
things
take
their
course
and
not
to
interfere
he
said
and
with
a
somewhat
uneasy
salute
turned
and
left
me
where
i
was
but
he
had
done
two
things
he
had
set
my
conscience
at
rest
and
he
had
awakened
my
delicacy
i
made
a
great
effort
once
more
dismissed
the
recollections
of
the
night
and
fell
once
more
to
brooding
on
my
saintly
poetess
at
the
same
time
i
could
not
quite
forget
that
i
had
been
locked
in
and
that
night
when
felipe
brought
me
my
supper
i
attacked
him
warily
on
both
points
of
interest
never
see
your
sister
said
i
casually
no
said
he
is
a
good
good
girl
and
his
mind
instantly
veered
to
something
else
sister
is
pious
i
suppose
i
asked
in
the
next
pause
he
cried
joining
his
hands
with
extreme
fervour
saint
it
is
she
that
keeps
me
up
are
very
fortunate
said
i
the
most
of
us
i
am
afraid
and
myself
among
the
number
are
better
at
going
down
said
felipe
earnestly
would
not
say
that
you
should
not
tempt
your
angel
if
one
goes
down
where
is
he
to
stop
felipe
said
i
had
no
guess
you
were
a
preacher
and
i
may
say
a
good
one
but
i
suppose
that
is
your
sister
doing
he
nodded
at
me
with
round
eyes
then
i
continued
has
doubtless
reproved
you
for
your
sin
of
cruelty
times
he
cried
for
this
was
the
phrase
by
which
the
odd
creature
expressed
the
sense
of
frequency
i
told
her
you
had
done
so
i
remembered
that
he
added
proudly
she
was
pleased
felipe
said
i
were
those
cries
that
i
heard
last
night
for
surely
they
were
cries
of
some
creature
in
suffering
wind
returned
felipe
looking
in
the
fire
i
took
his
hand
in
mine
at
which
thinking
it
to
be
a
caress
he
smiled
with
a
brightness
of
pleasure
that
came
near
disarming
my
resolve
but
i
trod
the
weakness
down
wind
i
repeated
yet
i
think
it
was
this
hand
holding
it
up
had
first
locked
me
in
the
lad
shook
visibly
but
answered
never
a
word
said
i
am
a
stranger
and
a
guest
it
is
not
my
part
either
to
meddle
or
to
judge
in
your
affairs
in
these
you
shall
take
your
sister
counsel
which
i
can
not
doubt
to
be
excellent
but
in
so
far
as
concerns
my
own
i
will
be
no
man
prisoner
and
i
demand
that
key
half
an
hour
later
my
door
was
suddenly
thrown
open
and
the
key
tossed
ringing
on
the
floor
a
day
or
two
after
i
came
in
from
a
walk
a
little
before
the
point
of
noon
the
senora
was
lying
lapped
in
slumber
on
the
threshold
of
the
recess
the
pigeons
dozed
below
the
eaves
like
snowdrifts
the
house
was
under
a
deep
spell
of
noontide
quiet
and
only
a
wandering
and
gentle
wind
from
the
mountain
stole
round
the
galleries
rustled
among
the
pomegranates
and
pleasantly
stirred
the
shadows
something
in
the
stillness
moved
me
to
imitation
and
i
went
very
lightly
across
the
court
and
up
the
marble
staircase
my
foot
was
on
the
topmost
round
when
a
door
opened
and
i
found
myself
face
to
face
with
olalla
surprise
transfixed
me
her
loveliness
struck
to
my
heart
she
glowed
in
the
deep
shadow
of
the
gallery
a
gem
of
colour
her
eyes
took
hold
upon
mine
and
clung
there
and
bound
us
together
like
the
joining
of
hands
and
the
moments
we
thus
stood
face
to
face
drinking
each
other
in
were
sacramental
and
the
wedding
of
souls
i
know
not
how
long
it
was
before
i
awoke
out
of
a
deep
trance
and
hastily
bowing
passed
on
into
the
upper
stair
she
did
not
move
but
followed
me
with
her
great
thirsting
eyes
and
as
i
passed
out
of
sight
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
she
paled
and
faded
in
my
own
room
i
opened
the
window
and
looked
out
and
could
not
think
what
change
had
come
upon
that
austere
field
of
mountains
that
it
should
thus
sing
and
shine
under
the
lofty
heaven
i
had
seen
her
olalla
and
the
stone
crags
answered
olalla
and
the
dumb
unfathomable
azure
answered
olalla
the
pale
saint
of
my
dreams
had
vanished
for
ever
and
in
her
place
i
beheld
this
maiden
on
whom
god
had
lavished
the
richest
colours
and
the
most
exuberant
energies
of
life
whom
he
had
made
active
as
a
deer
slender
as
a
reed
and
in
whose
great
eyes
he
had
lighted
the
torches
of
the
soul
the
thrill
of
her
young
life
strung
like
a
wild
animal
had
entered
into
me
the
force
of
soul
that
had
looked
out
from
her
eyes
and
conquered
mine
mantled
about
my
heart
and
sprang
to
my
lips
in
singing
she
passed
through
my
veins
she
was
one
with
me
i
will
not
say
that
this
enthusiasm
declined
rather
my
soul
held
out
in
its
ecstasy
as
in
a
strong
castle
and
was
there
besieged
by
cold
and
sorrowful
considerations
i
could
not
doubt
but
that
i
loved
her
at
first
sight
and
already
with
a
quivering
ardour
that
was
strange
to
my
experience
what
then
was
to
follow
she
was
the
child
of
an
afflicted
house
the
senora
daughter
the
sister
of
felipe
she
bore
it
even
in
her
beauty
she
had
the
lightness
and
swiftness
of
the
one
swift
as
an
arrow
light
as
dew
like
the
other
she
shone
on
the
pale
background
of
the
world
with
the
brilliancy
of
flowers
i
could
not
call
by
the
name
of
brother
that
lad
nor
by
the
name
of
mother
that
immovable
and
lovely
thing
of
flesh
whose
silly
eyes
and
perpetual
simper
now
recurred
to
my
mind
like
something
hateful
and
if
i
could
not
marry
what
then
she
was
helplessly
unprotected
her
eyes
in
that
single
and
long
glance
which
had
been
all
our
intercourse
had
confessed
a
weakness
equal
to
my
own
but
in
my
heart
i
knew
her
for
the
student
of
the
cold
northern
chamber
and
the
writer
of
the
sorrowful
lines
and
this
was
a
knowledge
to
disarm
a
brute
to
flee
was
more
than
i
could
find
courage
for
but
i
registered
a
vow
of
unsleeping
circumspection
as
i
turned
from
the
window
my
eyes
alighted
on
the
portrait
it
had
fallen
dead
like
a
candle
after
sunrise
it
followed
me
with
eyes
of
paint
i
knew
it
to
be
like
and
marvelled
at
the
tenacity
of
type
in
that
declining
race
but
the
likeness
was
swallowed
up
in
difference
i
remembered
how
it
had
seemed
to
me
a
thing
unapproachable
in
the
life
a
creature
rather
of
the
painter
craft
than
of
the
modesty
of
nature
and
i
marvelled
at
the
thought
and
exulted
in
the
image
of
olalla
beauty
i
had
seen
before
and
not
been
charmed
and
i
had
been
often
drawn
to
women
who
were
not
beautiful
except
to
me
but
in
olalla
all
that
i
desired
and
had
not
dared
to
imagine
was
united
i
did
not
see
her
the
next
day
and
my
heart
ached
and
my
eyes
longed
for
her
as
men
long
for
morning
but
the
day
after
when
i
returned
about
my
usual
hour
she
was
once
more
on
the
gallery
and
our
looks
once
more
met
and
embraced
i
would
have
spoken
i
would
have
drawn
near
to
her
but
strongly
as
she
plucked
at
my
heart
drawing
me
like
a
magnet
something
yet
more
imperious
withheld
me
and
i
could
only
bow
and
pass
by
and
she
leaving
my
salutation
unanswered
only
followed
me
with
her
noble
eyes
i
had
now
her
image
by
rote
and
as
i
conned
the
traits
in
memory
it
seemed
as
if
i
read
her
very
heart
she
was
dressed
with
something
of
her
mother
coquetry
and
love
of
positive
colour
her
robe
which
i
know
she
must
have
made
with
her
own
hands
clung
about
her
with
a
cunning
grace
after
the
fashion
of
that
country
besides
her
bodice
stood
open
in
the
middle
in
a
long
slit
and
here
in
spite
of
the
poverty
of
the
house
a
gold
coin
hanging
by
a
ribbon
lay
on
her
brown
bosom
these
were
proofs
had
any
been
needed
of
her
inborn
delight
in
life
and
her
own
loveliness
on
the
other
hand
in
her
eyes
that
hung
upon
mine
i
could
read
depth
beyond
depth
of
passion
and
sadness
lights
of
poetry
and
hope
blacknesses
of
despair
and
thoughts
that
were
above
the
earth
it
was
a
lovely
body
but
the
inmate
the
soul
was
more
than
worthy
of
that
lodging
should
i
leave
this
incomparable
flower
to
wither
unseen
on
these
rough
mountains
should
i
despise
the
great
gift
offered
me
in
the
eloquent
silence
of
her
eyes
here
was
a
soul
immured
should
i
not
burst
its
prison
all
side
considerations
fell
off
from
me
were
she
the
child
of
herod
i
swore
i
should
make
her
mine
and
that
very
evening
i
set
myself
with
a
mingled
sense
of
treachery
and
disgrace
to
captivate
the
brother
perhaps
i
read
him
with
more
favourable
eyes
perhaps
the
thought
of
his
sister
always
summoned
up
the
better
qualities
of
that
imperfect
soul
but
he
had
never
seemed
to
me
so
amiable
and
his
very
likeness
to
olalla
while
it
annoyed
yet
softened
me
a
third
day
passed
in
vain
an
empty
desert
of
hours
i
would
not
lose
a
chance
and
loitered
all
afternoon
in
the
court
where
to
give
myself
a
countenance
i
spoke
more
than
usual
with
the
senora
god
knows
it
was
with
a
most
tender
and
sincere
interest
that
i
now
studied
her
and
even
as
for
felipe
so
now
for
the
mother
i
was
conscious
of
a
growing
warmth
of
toleration
and
yet
i
wondered
even
while
i
spoke
with
her
she
would
doze
off
into
a
little
sleep
and
presently
awake
again
without
embarrassment
and
this
composure
staggered
me
and
again
as
i
marked
her
make
infinitesimal
changes
in
her
posture
savouring
and
lingering
on
the
bodily
pleasure
of
the
movement
i
was
driven
to
wonder
at
this
depth
of
passive
sensuality
she
lived
in
her
body
and
her
consciousness
was
all
sunk
into
and
disseminated
through
her
members
where
it
luxuriously
dwelt
lastly
i
could
not
grow
accustomed
to
her
eyes
each
time
she
turned
on
me
these
great
beautiful
and
meaningless
orbs
wide
open
to
the
day
but
closed
against
human
inquiry
each
time
i
had
occasion
to
observe
the
lively
changes
of
her
pupils
which
expanded
and
contracted
in
a
breath
i
know
not
what
it
was
came
over
me
i
can
find
no
name
for
the
mingled
feeling
of
disappointment
annoyance
and
distaste
that
jarred
along
my
nerves
i
tried
her
on
a
variety
of
subjects
equally
in
vain
and
at
last
led
the
talk
to
her
daughter
but
even
there
she
proved
indifferent
said
she
was
pretty
which
as
with
children
was
her
highest
word
of
commendation
but
was
plainly
incapable
of
any
higher
thought
and
when
i
remarked
that
olalla
seemed
silent
merely
yawned
in
my
face
and
replied
that
speech
was
of
no
great
use
when
you
had
nothing
to
say
speak
much
very
much
she
added
looking
at
me
with
expanded
pupils
and
then
again
yawned
and
again
showed
me
a
mouth
that
was
as
dainty
as
a
toy
this
time
i
took
the
hint
and
leaving
her
to
her
repose
went
up
into
my
own
chamber
to
sit
by
the
open
window
looking
on
the
hills
and
not
beholding
them
sunk
in
lustrous
and
deep
dreams
and
hearkening
in
fancy
to
the
note
of
a
voice
that
i
had
never
heard
i
awoke
on
the
fifth
morning
with
a
brightness
of
anticipation
that
seemed
to
challenge
fate
i
was
sure
of
myself
light
of
heart
and
foot
and
resolved
to
put
my
love
incontinently
to
the
touch
of
knowledge
it
should
lie
no
longer
under
the
bonds
of
silence
a
dumb
thing
living
by
the
eye
only
like
the
love
of
beasts
but
should
now
put
on
the
spirit
and
enter
upon
the
joys
of
the
complete
human
intimacy
i
thought
of
it
with
wild
hopes
like
a
voyager
to
el
dorado
into
that
unknown
and
lovely
country
of
her
soul
i
no
longer
trembled
to
adventure
yet
when
i
did
indeed
encounter
her
the
same
force
of
passion
descended
on
me
and
at
once
submerged
my
mind
speech
seemed
to
drop
away
from
me
like
a
childish
habit
and
i
but
drew
near
to
her
as
the
giddy
man
draws
near
to
the
margin
of
a
gulf
she
drew
back
from
me
a
little
as
i
came
but
her
eyes
did
not
waver
from
mine
and
these
lured
me
forward
at
last
when
i
was
already
within
reach
of
her
i
stopped
words
were
denied
me
if
i
advanced
i
could
but
clasp
her
to
my
heart
in
silence
and
all
that
was
sane
in
me
all
that
was
still
unconquered
revolted
against
the
thought
of
such
an
accost
so
we
stood
for
a
second
all
our
life
in
our
eyes
exchanging
salvos
of
attraction
and
yet
each
resisting
and
then
with
a
great
effort
of
the
will
and
conscious
at
the
same
time
of
a
sudden
bitterness
of
disappointment
i
turned
and
went
away
in
the
same
silence
what
power
lay
upon
me
that
i
could
not
speak
and
she
why
was
she
also
silent
why
did
she
draw
away
before
me
dumbly
with
fascinated
eyes
was
this
love
or
was
it
a
mere
brute
attraction
mindless
and
inevitable
like
that
of
the
magnet
for
the
steel
we
had
never
spoken
we
were
wholly
strangers
and
yet
an
influence
strong
as
the
grasp
of
a
giant
swept
us
silently
together
on
my
side
it
filled
me
with
impatience
and
yet
i
was
sure
that
she
was
worthy
i
had
seen
her
books
read
her
verses
and
thus
in
a
sense
divined
the
soul
of
my
mistress
but
on
her
side
it
struck
me
almost
cold
of
me
she
knew
nothing
but
my
bodily
favour
she
was
drawn
to
me
as
stones
fall
to
the
earth
the
laws
that
rule
the
earth
conducted
her
unconsenting
to
my
arms
and
i
drew
back
at
the
thought
of
such
a
bridal
and
began
to
be
jealous
for
myself
it
was
not
thus
that
i
desired
to
be
loved
and
then
i
began
to
fall
into
a
great
pity
for
the
girl
herself
i
thought
how
sharp
must
be
her
mortification
that
she
the
student
the
recluse
felipe
saintly
monitress
should
have
thus
confessed
an
overweening
weakness
for
a
man
with
whom
she
had
never
exchanged
a
word
and
at
the
coming
of
pity
all
other
thoughts
were
swallowed
up
and
i
longed
only
to
find
and
console
and
reassure
her
to
tell
her
how
wholly
her
love
was
returned
on
my
side
and
how
her
choice
even
if
blindly
made
was
not
unworthy
the
next
day
it
was
glorious
weather
depth
upon
depth
of
blue
the
mountains
the
sun
shone
wide
and
the
wind
in
the
trees
and
the
many
falling
torrents
in
the
mountains
filled
the
air
with
delicate
and
haunting
music
yet
i
was
prostrated
with
sadness
my
heart
wept
for
the
sight
of
olalla
as
a
child
weeps
for
its
mother
i
sat
down
on
a
boulder
on
the
verge
of
the
low
cliffs
that
bound
the
plateau
to
the
north
thence
i
looked
down
into
the
wooded
valley
of
a
stream
where
no
foot
came
in
the
mood
i
was
in
it
was
even
touching
to
behold
the
place
untenanted
it
lacked
olalla
and
i
thought
of
the
delight
and
glory
of
a
life
passed
wholly
with
her
in
that
strong
air
and
among
these
rugged
and
lovely
surroundings
at
first
with
a
whimpering
sentiment
and
then
again
with
such
a
fiery
joy
that
i
seemed
to
grow
in
strength
and
stature
like
a
samson
and
then
suddenly
i
was
aware
of
olalla
drawing
near
she
appeared
out
of
a
grove
of
and
came
straight
towards
me
and
i
stood
up
and
waited
she
seemed
in
her
walking
a
creature
of
such
life
and
fire
and
lightness
as
amazed
me
yet
she
came
quietly
and
slowly
her
energy
was
in
the
slowness
but
for
inimitable
strength
i
felt
she
would
have
run
she
would
have
flown
to
me
still
as
she
approached
she
kept
her
eyes
lowered
to
the
ground
and
when
she
had
drawn
quite
near
it
was
without
one
glance
that
she
addressed
me
at
the
first
note
of
her
voice
i
started
it
was
for
this
i
had
been
waiting
this
was
the
last
test
of
my
love
and
lo
her
enunciation
was
precise
and
clear
not
lisping
and
incomplete
like
that
of
her
family
and
the
voice
though
deeper
than
usual
with
women
was
still
both
youthful
and
womanly
she
spoke
in
a
rich
chord
golden
contralto
strains
mingled
with
hoarseness
as
the
red
threads
were
mingled
with
the
brown
among
her
tresses
it
was
not
only
a
voice
that
spoke
to
my
heart
directly
but
it
spoke
to
me
of
her
and
yet
her
words
immediately
plunged
me
back
upon
despair
will
go
away
she
said
her
example
broke
the
bonds
of
my
speech
i
felt
as
lightened
of
a
weight
or
as
if
a
spell
had
been
dissolved
i
know
not
in
what
words
i
answered
but
standing
before
her
on
the
cliffs
i
poured
out
the
whole
ardour
of
my
love
telling
her
that
i
lived
upon
the
thought
of
her
slept
only
to
dream
of
her
loveliness
and
would
gladly
forswear
my
country
my
language
and
my
friends
to
live
for
ever
by
her
side
and
then
strongly
commanding
myself
i
changed
the
note
i
reassured
i
comforted
her
i
told
her
i
had
divined
in
her
a
pious
and
heroic
spirit
with
which
i
was
worthy
to
sympathise
and
which
i
longed
to
share
and
lighten
i
told
her
the
voice
of
god
which
men
disobey
at
peril
and
if
we
were
thus
humbly
drawn
together
ay
even
as
by
a
miracle
of
love
it
must
imply
a
divine
fitness
in
our
souls
we
must
be
made
i
said
for
one
another
we
should
be
mad
rebels
i
cried
out
rebels
against
god
not
to
obey
this
instinct
she
shook
her
head
will
go
she
repeated
and
then
with
a
gesture
and
in
a
sudden
sharp
note
not
she
cried
morrow
but
at
this
sign
of
relenting
power
came
in
upon
me
in
a
tide
i
stretched
out
my
arms
and
called
upon
her
name
and
she
leaped
to
me
and
clung
to
me
the
hills
rocked
about
us
the
earth
quailed
a
shock
as
of
a
blow
went
through
me
and
left
me
blind
and
dizzy
and
the
next
moment
she
had
thrust
me
back
broken
rudely
from
my
arms
and
fled
with
the
speed
of
a
deer
among
the
i
stood
and
shouted
to
the
mountains
i
turned
and
went
back
towards
the
residencia
waltzing
upon
air
she
sent
me
away
and
yet
i
had
but
to
call
upon
her
name
and
she
came
to
me
these
were
but
the
weaknesses
of
girls
from
which
even
she
the
strangest
of
her
sex
was
not
exempted
go
not
i
olalla
o
not
i
olalla
my
olalla
a
bird
sang
near
by
and
in
that
season
birds
were
rare
it
bade
me
be
of
good
cheer
and
once
more
the
whole
countenance
of
nature
from
the
ponderous
and
stable
mountains
down
to
the
lightest
leaf
and
the
smallest
darting
fly
in
the
shadow
of
the
groves
began
to
stir
before
me
and
to
put
on
the
lineaments
of
life
and
wear
a
face
of
awful
joy
the
sunshine
struck
upon
the
hills
strong
as
a
hammer
on
the
anvil
and
the
hills
shook
the
earth
under
that
vigorous
insulation
yielded
up
heady
scents
the
woods
smouldered
in
the
blaze
i
felt
the
thrill
of
travail
and
delight
run
through
the
earth
something
elemental
something
rude
violent
and
savage
in
the
love
that
sang
in
my
heart
was
like
a
key
to
secrets
and
the
very
stones
that
rattled
under
my
feet
appeared
alive
and
friendly
olalla
her
touch
had
quickened
and
renewed
and
strung
me
up
to
the
old
pitch
of
concert
with
the
rugged
earth
to
a
swelling
of
the
soul
that
men
learn
to
forget
in
their
polite
assemblies
love
burned
in
me
like
rage
tenderness
waxed
fierce
i
hated
i
adored
i
pitied
i
revered
her
with
ecstasy
she
seemed
the
link
that
bound
me
in
with
dead
things
on
the
one
hand
and
with
our
pure
and
pitying
god
upon
the
other
a
thing
brutal
and
divine
and
akin
at
once
to
the
innocence
and
to
the
unbridled
forces
of
the
earth
my
head
thus
reeling
i
came
into
the
courtyard
of
the
residencia
and
the
sight
of
the
mother
struck
me
like
a
revelation
she
sat
there
all
sloth
and
contentment
blinking
under
the
strong
sunshine
branded
with
a
passive
enjoyment
a
creature
set
quite
apart
before
whom
my
ardour
fell
away
like
a
thing
ashamed
i
stopped
a
moment
and
commanding
such
shaken
tones
as
i
was
able
said
a
word
or
two
she
looked
at
me
with
her
unfathomable
kindness
her
voice
in
reply
sounded
vaguely
out
of
the
realm
of
peace
in
which
she
slumbered
and
there
fell
on
my
mind
for
the
first
time
a
sense
of
respect
for
one
so
uniformly
innocent
and
happy
and
i
passed
on
in
a
kind
of
wonder
at
myself
that
i
should
be
so
much
disquieted
on
my
table
there
lay
a
piece
of
the
same
yellow
paper
i
had
seen
in
the
north
room
it
was
written
on
with
pencil
in
the
same
hand
hand
and
i
picked
it
up
with
a
sudden
sinking
of
alarm
and
read
you
have
any
kindness
for
olalla
if
you
have
any
chivalry
for
a
creature
sorely
wrought
go
from
here
in
pity
in
honour
for
the
sake
of
him
who
died
i
supplicate
that
you
shall
go
i
looked
at
this
awhile
in
mere
stupidity
then
i
began
to
awaken
to
a
weariness
and
horror
of
life
the
sunshine
darkened
outside
on
the
bare
hills
and
i
began
to
shake
like
a
man
in
terror
the
vacancy
thus
suddenly
opened
in
my
life
unmanned
me
like
a
physical
void
it
was
not
my
heart
it
was
not
my
happiness
it
was
life
itself
that
was
involved
i
could
not
lose
her
i
said
so
and
stood
repeating
it
and
then
like
one
in
a
dream
i
moved
to
the
window
put
forth
my
hand
to
open
the
casement
and
thrust
it
through
the
pane
the
blood
spurted
from
my
wrist
and
with
an
instantaneous
quietude
and
command
of
myself
i
pressed
my
thumb
on
the
little
leaping
fountain
and
reflected
what
to
do
in
that
empty
room
there
was
nothing
to
my
purpose
i
felt
besides
that
i
required
assistance
there
shot
into
my
mind
a
hope
that
olalla
herself
might
be
my
helper
and
i
turned
and
went
down
stairs
still
keeping
my
thumb
upon
the
wound
there
was
no
sign
of
either
olalla
or
felipe
and
i
addressed
myself
to
the
recess
whither
the
senora
had
now
drawn
quite
back
and
sat
dozing
close
before
the
fire
for
no
degree
of
heat
appeared
too
much
for
her
me
said
i
i
disturb
you
but
i
must
apply
to
you
for
help
she
looked
up
sleepily
and
asked
me
what
it
was
and
with
the
very
words
i
thought
she
drew
in
her
breath
with
a
widening
of
the
nostrils
and
seemed
to
come
suddenly
and
fully
alive
have
cut
myself
i
said
rather
badly
see
and
i
held
out
my
two
hands
from
which
the
blood
was
oozing
and
dripping
her
great
eyes
opened
wide
the
pupils
shrank
into
points
a
veil
seemed
to
fall
from
her
face
and
leave
it
sharply
expressive
and
yet
inscrutable
and
as
i
still
stood
marvelling
a
little
at
her
disturbance
she
came
swiftly
up
to
me
and
stooped
and
caught
me
by
the
hand
and
the
next
moment
my
hand
was
at
her
mouth
and
she
had
bitten
me
to
the
bone
the
pang
of
the
bite
the
sudden
spurting
of
blood
and
the
monstrous
horror
of
the
act
flashed
through
me
all
in
one
and
i
beat
her
back
and
she
sprang
at
me
again
and
again
with
bestial
cries
cries
that
i
recognised
such
cries
as
had
awakened
me
on
the
night
of
the
high
wind
her
strength
was
like
that
of
madness
mine
was
rapidly
ebbing
with
the
loss
of
blood
my
mind
besides
was
whirling
with
the
abhorrent
strangeness
of
the
onslaught
and
i
was
already
forced
against
the
wall
when
olalla
ran
betwixt
us
and
felipe
following
at
a
bound
pinned
down
his
mother
on
the
floor
a
weakness
fell
upon
me
i
saw
heard
and
felt
but
i
was
incapable
of
movement
i
heard
the
struggle
roll
to
and
fro
upon
the
floor
the
yells
of
that
catamount
ringing
up
to
heaven
as
she
strove
to
reach
me
i
felt
olalla
clasp
me
in
her
arms
her
hair
falling
on
my
face
and
with
the
strength
of
a
man
raise
and
half
drag
half
carry
me
upstairs
into
my
own
room
where
she
cast
me
down
upon
the
bed
then
i
saw
her
hasten
to
the
door
and
lock
it
and
stand
an
instant
listening
to
the
savage
cries
that
shook
the
residencia
and
then
swift
and
light
as
a
thought
she
was
again
beside
me
binding
up
my
hand
laying
it
in
her
bosom
moaning
and
mourning
over
it
with
sounds
they
were
not
words
that
came
to
her
they
were
sounds
more
beautiful
than
speech
infinitely
touching
infinitely
tender
and
yet
as
i
lay
there
a
thought
stung
to
my
heart
a
thought
wounded
me
like
a
sword
a
thought
like
a
worm
in
a
flower
profaned
the
holiness
of
my
love
yes
they
were
beautiful
sounds
and
they
were
inspired
by
human
tenderness
but
was
their
beauty
human
all
day
i
lay
there
for
a
long
time
the
cries
of
that
nameless
female
thing
as
she
struggled
with
her
whelp
resounded
through
the
house
and
pierced
me
with
despairing
sorrow
and
disgust
they
were
the
of
my
love
my
love
was
murdered
was
not
only
dead
but
an
offence
to
me
and
yet
think
as
i
pleased
feel
as
i
must
it
still
swelled
within
me
like
a
storm
of
sweetness
and
my
heart
melted
at
her
looks
and
touch
this
horror
that
had
sprung
out
this
doubt
upon
olalla
this
savage
and
bestial
strain
that
ran
not
only
through
the
whole
behaviour
of
her
family
but
found
a
place
in
the
very
foundations
and
story
of
our
love
though
it
appalled
though
it
shocked
and
sickened
me
was
yet
not
of
power
to
break
the
knot
of
my
infatuation
when
the
cries
had
ceased
there
came
a
scraping
at
the
door
by
which
i
knew
felipe
was
without
and
olalla
went
and
spoke
to
him
i
know
not
what
with
that
exception
she
stayed
close
beside
me
now
kneeling
by
my
bed
and
fervently
praying
now
sitting
with
her
eyes
upon
mine
so
then
for
these
six
hours
i
drank
in
her
beauty
and
silently
perused
the
story
in
her
face
i
saw
the
golden
coin
hover
on
her
breaths
i
saw
her
eyes
darken
and
brighter
and
still
speak
no
language
but
that
of
an
unfathomable
kindness
i
saw
the
faultless
face
and
through
the
robe
the
lines
of
the
faultless
body
night
came
at
last
and
in
the
growing
darkness
of
the
chamber
the
sight
of
her
slowly
melted
but
even
then
the
touch
of
her
smooth
hand
lingered
in
mine
and
talked
with
me
to
lie
thus
in
deadly
weakness
and
drink
in
the
traits
of
the
beloved
is
to
reawake
to
love
from
whatever
shock
of
disillusion
i
reasoned
with
myself
and
i
shut
my
eyes
on
horrors
and
again
i
was
very
bold
to
accept
the
worst
what
mattered
it
if
that
imperious
sentiment
survived
if
her
eyes
still
beckoned
and
attached
me
if
now
even
as
before
every
fibre
of
my
dull
body
yearned
and
turned
to
her
late
on
in
the
night
some
strength
revived
in
me
and
i
spoke
i
said
matters
i
ask
nothing
i
am
content
i
love
you
she
knelt
down
awhile
and
prayed
and
i
devoutly
respected
her
devotions
the
moon
had
begun
to
shine
in
upon
one
side
of
each
of
the
three
windows
and
make
a
misty
clearness
in
the
room
by
which
i
saw
her
indistinctly
when
she
rearose
she
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
is
for
me
to
speak
she
said
for
you
to
listen
i
know
you
can
but
guess
i
prayed
how
i
prayed
for
you
to
leave
this
place
i
begged
it
of
you
and
i
know
you
would
have
granted
me
even
this
or
if
not
o
let
me
think
so
love
you
i
said
yet
you
have
lived
in
the
world
she
said
after
a
pause
are
a
man
and
wise
and
i
am
but
a
child
forgive
me
if
i
seem
to
teach
who
am
as
ignorant
as
the
trees
of
the
mountain
but
those
who
learn
much
do
but
skim
the
face
of
knowledge
they
seize
the
laws
they
conceive
the
dignity
of
the
design
the
horror
of
the
living
fact
fades
from
their
memory
it
is
we
who
sit
at
home
with
evil
who
remember
i
think
and
are
warned
and
pity
go
rather
go
now
and
keep
me
in
mind
so
i
shall
have
a
life
in
the
cherished
places
of
your
memory
a
life
as
much
my
own
as
that
which
i
lead
in
this
body
love
you
i
said
once
more
and
reaching
out
my
weak
hand
took
hers
and
carried
it
to
my
lips
and
kissed
it
nor
did
she
resist
but
winced
a
little
and
i
could
see
her
look
upon
me
with
a
frown
that
was
not
unkindly
only
sad
and
baffled
and
then
it
seemed
she
made
a
call
upon
her
resolution
plucked
my
hand
towards
her
herself
at
the
same
time
leaning
somewhat
forward
and
laid
it
on
the
beating
of
her
heart
she
cried
feel
the
very
footfall
of
my
life
it
only
moves
for
you
it
is
yours
but
is
it
even
mine
it
is
mine
indeed
to
offer
you
as
i
might
take
the
coin
from
my
neck
as
i
might
break
a
live
branch
from
a
tree
and
give
it
you
and
yet
not
mine
i
dwell
or
i
think
i
dwell
if
i
exist
at
all
somewhere
apart
an
impotent
prisoner
and
carried
about
and
deafened
by
a
mob
that
i
disown
this
capsule
such
as
throbs
against
the
sides
of
animals
knows
you
at
a
touch
for
its
master
ay
it
loves
you
but
my
soul
does
my
soul
i
think
not
i
know
not
fearing
to
ask
yet
when
you
spoke
to
me
your
words
were
of
the
soul
it
is
of
the
soul
that
you
ask
it
is
only
from
the
soul
that
you
would
take
me
i
said
soul
and
the
body
are
one
and
mostly
so
in
love
what
the
body
chooses
the
soul
loves
where
the
body
clings
the
soul
cleaves
body
for
body
soul
to
soul
they
come
together
at
god
signal
and
the
lower
part
if
we
can
call
aught
low
is
only
the
footstool
and
foundation
of
the
highest
you
she
said
the
portraits
in
the
house
of
my
fathers
have
you
looked
at
my
mother
or
at
felipe
have
your
eyes
never
rested
on
that
picture
that
hangs
by
your
bed
she
who
sat
for
it
died
ages
ago
and
she
did
evil
in
her
life
but
there
is
my
hand
to
the
least
line
there
are
my
eyes
and
my
hair
what
is
mine
then
and
what
am
i
if
not
a
curve
in
this
poor
body
of
mine
which
you
love
and
for
the
sake
of
which
you
dotingly
dream
that
you
love
me
not
a
gesture
that
i
can
frame
not
a
tone
of
my
voice
not
any
look
from
my
eyes
no
not
even
now
when
i
speak
to
him
i
love
but
has
belonged
to
others
others
ages
dead
have
wooed
other
men
with
my
eyes
other
men
have
heard
the
pleading
of
the
same
voice
that
now
sounds
in
your
ears
the
hands
of
the
dead
are
in
my
bosom
they
move
me
they
pluck
me
they
guide
me
i
am
a
puppet
at
their
command
and
i
but
reinform
features
and
attributes
that
have
long
been
laid
aside
from
evil
in
the
quiet
of
the
grave
is
it
me
you
love
friend
or
the
race
that
made
me
the
girl
who
does
not
know
and
can
not
answer
for
the
least
portion
of
herself
or
the
stream
of
which
she
is
a
transitory
eddy
the
tree
of
which
she
is
the
passing
fruit
the
race
exists
it
is
old
it
is
ever
young
it
carries
its
eternal
destiny
in
its
bosom
upon
it
like
waves
upon
the
sea
individual
succeeds
to
individual
mocked
with
a
semblance
of
control
but
they
are
nothing
we
speak
of
the
soul
but
the
soul
is
in
the
race
fret
against
the
common
law
i
said
rebel
against
the
voice
of
god
which
he
has
made
so
winning
to
convince
so
imperious
to
command
hear
it
and
how
it
speaks
between
us
your
hand
clings
to
mine
your
heart
leaps
at
my
touch
the
unknown
elements
of
which
we
are
compounded
awake
and
run
together
at
a
look
the
clay
of
the
earth
remembers
its
independent
life
and
yearns
to
join
us
we
are
drawn
together
as
the
stars
are
turned
about
in
space
or
as
the
tides
ebb
and
flow
by
things
older
and
greater
than
we
ourselves
she
said
can
i
say
to
you
my
fathers
eight
hundred
years
ago
ruled
all
this
province
they
were
wise
great
cunning
and
cruel
they
were
a
picked
race
of
the
spanish
their
flags
led
in
war
the
king
called
them
his
cousin
the
people
when
the
rope
was
slung
for
them
or
when
they
returned
and
found
their
hovels
smoking
blasphemed
their
name
presently
a
change
began
man
has
risen
if
he
has
sprung
from
the
brutes
he
can
descend
again
to
the
same
level
the
breath
of
weariness
blew
on
their
humanity
and
the
cords
relaxed
they
began
to
go
down
their
minds
fell
on
sleep
their
passions
awoke
in
gusts
heady
and
senseless
like
the
wind
in
the
gutters
of
the
mountains
beauty
was
still
handed
down
but
no
longer
the
guiding
wit
nor
the
human
heart
the
seed
passed
on
it
was
wrapped
in
flesh
the
flesh
covered
the
bones
but
they
were
the
bones
and
the
flesh
of
brutes
and
their
mind
was
as
the
mind
of
flies
i
speak
to
you
as
i
dare
but
you
have
seen
for
yourself
how
the
wheel
has
gone
backward
with
my
doomed
race
i
stand
as
it
were
upon
a
little
rising
ground
in
this
desperate
descent
and
see
both
before
and
behind
both
what
we
have
lost
and
to
what
we
are
condemned
to
go
farther
downward
and
shall
i
i
that
dwell
apart
in
the
house
of
the
dead
my
body
loathing
its
ways
shall
i
repeat
the
spell
shall
i
bind
another
spirit
reluctant
as
my
own
into
this
bewitched
and
tenement
that
i
now
suffer
in
shall
i
hand
down
this
cursed
vessel
of
humanity
charge
it
with
fresh
life
as
with
fresh
poison
and
dash
it
like
a
fire
in
the
faces
of
posterity
but
my
vow
has
been
given
the
race
shall
cease
from
off
the
earth
at
this
hour
my
brother
is
making
ready
his
foot
will
soon
be
on
the
stair
and
you
will
go
with
him
and
pass
out
of
my
sight
for
ever
think
of
me
sometimes
as
one
to
whom
the
lesson
of
life
was
very
harshly
told
but
who
heard
it
with
courage
as
one
who
loved
you
indeed
but
who
hated
herself
so
deeply
that
her
love
was
hateful
to
her
as
one
who
sent
you
away
and
yet
would
have
longed
to
keep
you
for
ever
who
had
no
dearer
hope
than
to
forget
you
and
no
greater
fear
than
to
be
forgotten
she
had
drawn
towards
the
door
as
she
spoke
her
rich
voice
sounding
softer
and
farther
away
and
with
the
last
word
she
was
gone
and
i
lay
alone
in
the
moonlit
chamber
what
i
might
have
done
had
not
i
lain
bound
by
my
extreme
weakness
i
know
not
but
as
it
was
there
fell
upon
me
a
great
and
blank
despair
it
was
not
long
before
there
shone
in
at
the
door
the
ruddy
glimmer
of
a
lantern
and
felipe
coming
charged
me
without
a
word
upon
his
shoulders
and
carried
me
down
to
the
great
gate
where
the
cart
was
waiting
in
the
moonlight
the
hills
stood
out
sharply
as
if
they
were
of
cardboard
on
the
glimmering
surface
of
the
plateau
and
from
among
the
low
trees
which
swung
together
and
sparkled
in
the
wind
the
great
black
cube
of
the
residencia
stood
out
bulkily
its
mass
only
broken
by
three
dimly
lighted
windows
in
the
northern
front
above
the
gate
they
were
olalla
windows
and
as
the
cart
jolted
onwards
i
kept
my
eyes
fixed
upon
them
till
where
the
road
dipped
into
a
valley
they
were
lost
to
my
view
forever
felipe
walked
in
silence
beside
the
shafts
but
from
time
to
time
he
would
cheek
the
mule
and
seem
to
look
back
upon
me
and
at
length
drew
quite
near
and
laid
his
hand
upon
my
head
there
was
such
kindness
in
the
touch
and
such
a
simplicity
as
of
the
brutes
that
tears
broke
from
me
like
the
bursting
of
an
artery
i
said
me
where
they
will
ask
no
questions
he
said
never
a
word
but
he
turned
his
mule
about
end
for
end
retraced
some
part
of
the
way
we
had
gone
and
striking
into
another
path
led
me
to
the
mountain
village
which
was
as
we
say
in
scotland
the
kirkton
of
that
thinly
peopled
district
some
broken
memories
dwell
in
my
mind
of
the
day
breaking
over
the
plain
of
the
cart
stopping
of
arms
that
helped
me
down
of
a
bare
room
into
which
i
was
carried
and
of
a
swoon
that
fell
upon
me
like
sleep
the
next
day
and
the
days
following
the
old
priest
was
often
at
my
side
with
his
and
prayer
book
and
after
a
while
when
i
began
to
pick
up
strength
he
told
me
that
i
was
now
on
a
fair
way
to
recovery
and
must
as
soon
as
possible
hurry
my
departure
whereupon
without
naming
any
reason
he
took
snuff
and
looked
at
me
sideways
i
did
not
affect
ignorance
i
knew
he
must
have
seen
olalla
said
i
know
that
i
do
not
ask
in
wantonness
what
of
that
family
he
said
they
were
very
unfortunate
that
it
seemed
a
declining
race
and
that
they
were
very
poor
and
had
been
much
neglected
she
has
not
i
said
doubtless
to
yourself
she
is
instructed
and
wise
beyond
the
use
of
women
he
said
senorita
is
but
the
family
has
been
neglected
mother
i
queried
the
mother
too
said
the
padre
taking
snuff
felipe
is
a
lad
mother
is
odd
i
asked
odd
replied
the
priest
think
sir
we
beat
about
the
bush
said
i
must
know
more
of
my
affairs
than
you
allow
you
must
know
my
curiosity
to
be
justified
on
many
grounds
will
you
not
be
frank
with
me
son
said
the
old
gentleman
will
be
very
frank
with
you
on
matters
within
my
competence
on
those
of
which
i
know
nothing
it
does
not
require
much
discretion
to
be
silent
i
will
not
fence
with
you
i
take
your
meaning
perfectly
and
what
can
i
say
but
that
we
are
all
in
god
hands
and
that
his
ways
are
not
as
our
ways
i
have
even
advised
with
my
superiors
in
the
church
but
they
too
were
dumb
it
is
a
great
mystery
she
mad
i
asked
will
answer
you
according
to
my
belief
she
is
not
returned
the
padre
she
was
not
when
she
was
young
god
help
me
i
fear
i
neglected
that
wild
lamb
she
was
surely
sane
and
yet
although
it
did
not
run
to
such
heights
the
same
strain
was
already
notable
it
had
been
so
before
her
in
her
father
ay
and
before
him
and
this
inclined
me
perhaps
to
think
too
lightly
of
it
but
these
things
go
on
growing
not
only
in
the
individual
but
in
the
race
she
was
young
i
began
and
my
voice
failed
me
for
a
moment
and
it
was
only
with
a
great
effort
that
i
was
able
to
add
she
like
olalla
god
forbid
exclaimed
the
padre
forbid
that
any
man
should
think
so
slightingly
of
my
favourite
penitent
no
no
the
senorita
but
for
her
beauty
which
i
wish
most
honestly
she
had
less
of
has
not
a
hair
resemblance
to
what
her
mother
was
at
the
same
age
i
could
not
bear
to
have
you
think
so
though
heaven
knows
it
were
perhaps
better
that
you
should
at
this
i
raised
myself
in
bed
and
opened
my
heart
to
the
old
man
telling
him
of
our
love
and
of
her
decision
owning
my
own
horrors
my
own
passing
fancies
but
telling
him
that
these
were
at
an
end
and
with
something
more
than
a
purely
formal
submission
appealing
to
his
judgment
he
heard
me
very
patiently
and
without
surprise
and
when
i
had
done
he
sat
for
some
time
silent
then
he
began
church
and
instantly
broke
off
again
to
apologise
had
forgotten
my
child
that
you
were
not
a
christian
said
he
indeed
upon
a
point
so
highly
unusual
even
the
church
can
scarce
be
said
to
have
decided
but
would
you
have
my
opinion
the
senorita
is
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
the
best
judge
i
would
accept
her
judgment
on
the
back
of
that
he
went
away
nor
was
he
thenceforward
so
assiduous
in
his
visits
indeed
even
when
i
began
to
get
about
again
he
plainly
feared
and
deprecated
my
society
not
as
in
distaste
but
much
as
a
man
might
be
disposed
to
flee
from
the
riddling
sphynx
the
villagers
too
avoided
me
they
were
unwilling
to
be
my
guides
upon
the
mountain
i
thought
they
looked
at
me
askance
and
i
made
sure
that
the
more
superstitious
crossed
themselves
on
my
approach
at
first
i
set
this
down
to
my
heretical
opinions
but
it
began
at
length
to
dawn
upon
me
that
if
i
was
thus
redoubted
it
was
because
i
had
stayed
at
the
residencia
all
men
despise
the
savage
notions
of
such
peasantry
and
yet
i
was
conscious
of
a
chill
shadow
that
seemed
to
fall
and
dwell
upon
my
love
it
did
not
conquer
but
i
may
not
deify
that
it
restrained
my
ardour
some
miles
westward
of
the
village
there
was
a
gap
in
the
sierra
from
which
the
eye
plunged
direct
upon
the
residencia
and
thither
it
became
my
daily
habit
to
repair
a
wood
crowned
the
summit
and
just
where
the
pathway
issued
from
its
fringes
it
was
overhung
by
a
considerable
shelf
of
rock
and
that
in
its
turn
was
surmounted
by
a
crucifix
of
the
size
of
life
and
more
than
usually
painful
in
design
this
was
my
perch
thence
day
after
day
i
looked
down
upon
the
plateau
and
the
great
old
house
and
could
see
felipe
no
bigger
than
a
fly
going
to
and
fro
about
the
garden
sometimes
mists
would
draw
across
the
view
and
be
broken
up
again
by
mountain
winds
sometimes
the
plain
slumbered
below
me
in
unbroken
sunshine
it
would
sometimes
be
all
blotted
out
by
rain
this
distant
post
these
interrupted
sights
of
the
place
where
my
life
had
been
so
strangely
changed
suited
the
indecision
of
my
humour
i
passed
whole
days
there
debating
with
myself
the
various
elements
of
our
position
now
leaning
to
the
suggestions
of
love
now
giving
an
ear
to
prudence
and
in
the
end
halting
irresolute
between
the
two
one
day
as
i
was
sitting
on
my
rock
there
came
by
that
way
a
somewhat
gaunt
peasant
wrapped
in
a
mantle
he
was
a
stranger
and
plainly
did
not
know
me
even
by
repute
for
instead
of
keeping
the
other
side
he
drew
near
and
sat
down
beside
me
and
we
had
soon
fallen
in
talk
among
other
things
he
told
me
he
had
been
a
muleteer
and
in
former
years
had
much
frequented
these
mountains
later
on
he
had
followed
the
army
with
his
mules
had
realised
a
competence
and
was
now
living
retired
with
his
family
you
know
that
house
i
inquired
at
last
pointing
to
the
residencia
for
i
readily
wearied
of
any
talk
that
kept
me
from
the
thought
of
olalla
he
looked
at
me
darkly
and
crossed
himself
well
he
said
was
there
that
one
of
my
comrades
sold
himself
to
satan
the
virgin
shield
us
from
temptations
he
has
paid
the
price
he
is
now
burning
in
the
reddest
place
in
hell
a
fear
came
upon
me
i
could
answer
nothing
and
presently
the
man
resumed
as
if
to
himself
he
said
yes
i
know
it
i
have
passed
its
doors
there
was
snow
upon
the
pass
the
wind
was
driving
it
sure
enough
there
was
death
that
night
upon
the
mountains
but
there
was
worse
beside
the
hearth
i
took
him
by
the
arm
senor
and
dragged
him
to
the
gate
i
conjured
him
by
all
he
loved
and
respected
to
go
forth
with
me
i
went
on
my
knees
before
him
in
the
snow
and
i
could
see
he
was
moved
by
my
entreaty
and
just
then
she
came
out
on
the
gallery
and
called
him
by
his
name
and
he
turned
and
there
was
she
standing
with
a
lamp
in
her
hand
and
smiling
on
him
to
come
back
i
cried
out
aloud
to
god
and
threw
my
arms
about
him
but
he
put
me
by
and
left
me
alone
he
had
made
his
choice
god
help
us
i
would
pray
for
him
but
to
what
end
there
are
sins
that
not
even
the
pope
can
loose
your
friend
i
asked
became
of
him
god
knows
said
the
muleteer
all
be
true
that
we
hear
his
end
was
like
his
sin
a
thing
to
raise
the
hair
you
mean
that
he
was
killed
i
asked
enough
he
was
killed
returned
the
man
how
ay
how
but
these
are
things
that
it
is
sin
to
speak
of
people
of
that
house
i
began
but
he
interrupted
me
with
a
savage
outburst
people
he
cried
people
there
are
neither
men
nor
women
in
that
house
of
satan
what
have
you
lived
here
so
long
and
never
heard
and
here
he
put
his
mouth
to
my
ear
and
whispered
as
if
even
the
fowls
of
the
mountain
might
have
and
been
stricken
with
horror
what
he
told
me
was
not
true
nor
was
it
even
original
being
indeed
but
a
new
edition
vamped
up
again
by
village
ignorance
and
superstition
of
stories
nearly
as
ancient
as
the
race
of
man
it
was
rather
the
application
that
appalled
me
in
the
old
days
he
said
the
church
would
have
burned
out
that
nest
of
basilisks
but
the
arm
of
the
church
was
now
shortened
his
friend
miguel
had
been
unpunished
by
the
hands
of
men
and
left
to
the
more
awful
judgment
of
an
offended
god
this
was
wrong
but
it
should
be
so
no
more
the
padre
was
sunk
in
age
he
was
even
bewitched
himself
but
the
eyes
of
his
flock
were
now
awake
to
their
own
danger
and
some
day
ay
and
before
long
the
smoke
of
that
house
should
go
up
to
heaven
he
left
me
filled
with
horror
and
fear
which
way
to
turn
i
knew
not
whether
first
to
warn
the
padre
or
to
carry
my
direct
to
the
threatened
inhabitants
of
the
residencia
fate
was
to
decide
for
me
for
while
i
was
still
hesitating
i
beheld
the
veiled
figure
of
a
woman
drawing
near
to
me
up
the
pathway
no
veil
could
deceive
my
penetration
by
every
line
and
every
movement
i
recognised
olalla
and
keeping
hidden
behind
a
corner
of
the
rock
i
suffered
her
to
gain
the
summit
then
i
came
forward
she
knew
me
and
paused
but
did
not
speak
i
too
remained
silent
and
we
continued
for
some
time
to
gaze
upon
each
other
with
a
passionate
sadness
thought
you
had
gone
she
said
at
length
is
all
that
you
can
do
for
me
to
go
it
is
all
i
ever
asked
of
you
and
you
still
stay
but
do
you
know
that
every
day
heaps
up
the
peril
of
death
not
only
on
your
head
but
on
ours
a
report
has
gone
about
the
mountain
it
is
thought
you
love
me
and
the
people
will
not
suffer
it
i
saw
she
was
already
informed
of
her
danger
and
i
rejoiced
at
it
i
said
am
ready
to
go
this
day
this
very
hour
but
not
alone
she
stepped
aside
and
knelt
down
before
the
crucifix
to
pray
and
i
stood
by
and
looked
now
at
her
and
now
at
the
object
of
her
adoration
now
at
the
living
figure
of
the
penitent
and
now
at
the
ghastly
daubed
countenance
the
painted
wounds
and
the
projected
ribs
of
the
image
the
silence
was
only
broken
by
the
wailing
of
some
large
birds
that
circled
sidelong
as
if
in
surprise
or
alarm
about
the
summit
of
the
hills
presently
olalla
rose
again
turned
towards
me
raised
her
veil
and
still
leaning
with
one
hand
on
the
shaft
of
the
crucifix
looked
upon
me
with
a
pale
and
sorrowful
countenance
have
laid
my
hand
upon
the
cross
she
said
padre
says
you
are
no
christian
but
look
up
for
a
moment
with
my
eyes
and
behold
the
face
of
the
man
of
sorrows
we
are
all
such
as
he
was
the
inheritors
of
sin
we
must
all
bear
and
expiate
a
past
which
was
not
ours
there
is
in
all
of
us
ay
even
in
me
a
sparkle
of
the
divine
like
him
we
must
endure
for
a
little
while
until
morning
returns
bringing
peace
suffer
me
to
pass
on
upon
my
way
alone
it
is
thus
that
i
shall
be
least
lonely
counting
for
my
friend
him
who
is
the
friend
of
all
the
distressed
it
is
thus
that
i
shall
be
the
most
happy
having
taken
my
farewell
of
earthly
happiness
and
willingly
accepted
sorrow
for
my
portion
i
looked
at
the
face
of
the
crucifix
and
though
i
was
no
friend
to
images
and
despised
that
imitative
and
grimacing
art
of
which
it
was
a
rude
example
some
sense
of
what
the
thing
implied
was
carried
home
to
my
intelligence
the
face
looked
down
upon
me
with
a
painful
and
deadly
contraction
but
the
rays
of
a
glory
encircled
it
and
reminded
me
that
the
sacrifice
was
voluntary
it
stood
there
crowning
the
rock
as
it
still
stands
on
so
many
highway
sides
vainly
preaching
to
an
emblem
of
sad
and
noble
truths
that
pleasure
is
not
an
end
but
an
accident
that
pain
is
the
choice
of
the
magnanimous
that
it
is
best
to
suffer
all
things
and
do
well
i
turned
and
went
down
the
mountain
in
silence
and
when
i
looked
back
for
the
last
time
before
the
wood
closed
about
my
path
i
saw
olalla
still
leaning
on
the
crucifix
the
treasure
of
franchard
chapter
i
by
the
dying
mountebank
they
had
sent
for
the
doctor
from
bourron
before
six
about
eight
some
villagers
came
round
for
the
performance
and
were
told
how
matters
stood
it
seemed
a
liberty
for
a
mountebank
to
fall
ill
like
real
people
and
they
made
off
again
in
dudgeon
by
ten
madame
tentaillon
was
gravely
alarmed
and
had
sent
down
the
street
for
doctor
desprez
the
doctor
was
at
work
over
his
manuscripts
in
one
corner
of
the
little
and
his
wife
was
asleep
over
the
fire
in
another
when
the
messenger
arrived
said
the
doctor
should
have
sent
for
me
before
it
was
a
case
for
hurry
and
he
followed
the
messenger
as
he
was
in
his
slippers
and
the
inn
was
not
thirty
yards
away
but
the
messenger
did
not
stop
there
he
went
in
at
one
door
and
out
by
another
into
the
court
and
then
led
the
way
by
a
flight
of
steps
beside
the
stable
to
the
loft
where
the
mountebank
lay
sick
if
doctor
desprez
were
to
live
a
thousand
years
he
would
never
forget
his
arrival
in
that
room
for
not
only
was
the
scene
picturesque
but
the
moment
made
a
date
in
his
existence
we
reckon
our
lives
i
hardly
know
why
from
the
date
of
our
first
sorry
appearance
in
society
as
if
from
a
first
humiliation
for
no
actor
can
come
upon
the
stage
with
a
worse
grace
not
to
go
further
back
which
would
be
judged
too
curious
there
are
subsequently
many
moving
and
decisive
accidents
in
the
lives
of
all
which
would
make
as
logical
a
period
as
this
of
birth
and
here
for
instance
doctor
desprez
a
man
past
forty
who
had
made
what
is
called
a
failure
in
life
and
was
moreover
married
found
himself
at
a
new
point
of
departure
when
he
opened
the
door
of
the
loft
above
tentaillon
stable
it
was
a
large
place
lighted
only
by
a
single
candle
set
upon
the
floor
the
mountebank
lay
on
his
back
upon
a
pallet
a
large
man
with
a
quixotic
nose
inflamed
with
drinking
madame
tentaillon
stooped
over
him
applying
a
hot
water
and
mustard
embrocation
to
his
feet
and
on
a
chair
close
by
sat
a
little
fellow
of
eleven
or
twelve
with
his
feet
dangling
these
three
were
the
only
occupants
except
the
shadows
but
the
shadows
were
a
company
in
themselves
the
extent
of
the
room
exaggerated
them
to
a
gigantic
size
and
from
the
low
position
of
the
candle
the
light
struck
upwards
and
produced
deformed
foreshortenings
the
mountebank
profile
was
enlarged
upon
the
wall
in
caricature
and
it
was
strange
to
see
his
nose
shorten
and
lengthen
as
the
flame
was
blown
about
by
draughts
as
for
madame
tentaillon
her
shadow
was
no
more
than
a
gross
hump
of
shoulders
with
now
and
again
a
hemisphere
of
head
the
chair
legs
were
spindled
out
as
long
as
stilts
and
the
boy
set
perched
atop
of
them
like
a
cloud
in
the
corner
of
the
roof
it
was
the
boy
who
took
the
doctor
fancy
he
had
a
great
arched
skull
the
forehead
and
the
hands
of
a
musician
and
a
pair
of
haunting
eyes
it
was
not
merely
that
these
eyes
were
large
or
steady
or
the
softest
ruddy
brown
there
was
a
look
in
them
besides
which
thrilled
the
doctor
and
made
him
half
uneasy
he
was
sure
he
had
seen
such
a
look
before
and
yet
he
could
not
remember
how
or
where
it
was
as
if
this
boy
who
was
quite
a
stranger
to
him
had
the
eyes
of
an
old
friend
or
an
old
enemy
and
the
boy
would
give
him
no
peace
he
seemed
profoundly
indifferent
to
what
was
going
on
or
rather
abstracted
from
it
in
a
superior
contemplation
beating
gently
with
his
feet
against
the
bars
of
the
chair
and
holding
his
hands
folded
on
his
lap
but
for
all
that
his
eyes
kept
following
the
doctor
about
the
room
with
a
thoughtful
fixity
of
gaze
desprez
could
not
tell
whether
he
was
fascinating
the
boy
or
the
boy
was
fascinating
him
he
busied
himself
over
the
sick
man
he
put
questions
he
felt
the
pulse
he
jested
he
grew
a
little
hot
and
swore
and
still
whenever
he
looked
round
there
were
the
brown
eyes
waiting
for
his
with
the
same
inquiring
melancholy
gaze
at
last
the
doctor
hit
on
the
solution
at
a
leap
he
remembered
the
look
now
the
little
fellow
although
he
was
as
straight
as
a
dart
had
the
eyes
that
go
usually
with
a
crooked
back
he
was
not
at
all
deformed
and
yet
a
deformed
person
seemed
to
be
looking
at
you
from
below
his
brows
the
doctor
drew
a
long
breath
he
was
so
much
relieved
to
find
a
theory
for
he
loved
theories
and
to
explain
away
his
interest
for
all
that
he
despatched
the
invalid
with
unusual
haste
and
still
kneeling
with
one
knee
on
the
floor
turned
a
little
round
and
looked
the
boy
over
at
his
leisure
the
boy
was
not
in
the
least
put
out
but
looked
placidly
back
at
the
doctor
this
your
father
asked
desprez
no
returned
the
boy
master
you
fond
of
him
continued
the
doctor
sir
said
the
boy
madame
tentaillon
and
desprez
exchanged
expressive
glances
is
bad
my
man
resumed
the
latter
with
a
shade
of
sternness
one
should
be
fond
of
the
dying
or
conceal
their
sentiments
and
your
master
here
is
dying
if
i
have
watched
a
bird
a
little
while
stealing
my
cherries
i
have
a
thought
of
disappointment
when
he
flies
away
over
my
garden
wall
and
i
see
him
steer
for
the
forest
and
vanish
how
much
more
a
creature
such
as
this
so
strong
so
astute
so
richly
endowed
with
faculties
when
i
think
that
in
a
few
hours
the
speech
will
be
silenced
the
breath
extinct
and
even
the
shadow
vanished
from
the
wall
i
who
never
saw
him
this
lady
who
knew
him
only
as
a
guest
are
touched
with
some
affection
the
boy
was
silent
for
a
little
and
appeared
to
be
reflecting
did
not
know
him
he
replied
at
last
was
a
bad
man
is
a
little
pagan
said
the
landlady
that
matter
they
are
all
the
same
these
mountebanks
tumblers
artists
and
what
not
they
have
no
interior
but
the
doctor
was
still
scrutinising
the
little
pagan
his
eyebrows
knotted
and
uplifted
is
your
name
he
asked
said
the
lad
desprez
leaped
upon
him
with
one
of
his
sudden
flashes
of
excitement
and
felt
his
head
all
over
from
an
ethnological
point
of
view
celtic
he
said
cried
madame
tentaillon
who
had
perhaps
confounded
the
word
with
hydrocephalous
lad
is
it
dangerous
depends
returned
the
doctor
grimly
and
then
once
more
addressing
the
boy
what
do
you
do
for
your
living
he
inquired
tumble
was
the
answer
tumble
repeated
desprez
healthful
i
hazard
the
guess
madame
tentaillon
that
tumbling
is
a
healthful
way
of
life
and
have
you
never
done
anything
else
but
tumble
i
learned
that
i
used
to
steal
answered
gravely
my
word
cried
the
doctor
are
a
nice
little
man
for
your
age
madame
when
my
comes
from
bourron
you
will
communicate
my
unfavourable
opinion
i
leave
the
case
in
his
hands
but
of
course
on
any
alarming
symptom
above
all
if
there
should
be
a
sign
of
rally
do
not
hesitate
to
knock
me
up
i
am
a
doctor
no
longer
i
thank
god
but
i
have
been
one
good
night
madame
good
sleep
to
you
chapter
ii
morning
talk
doctor
desprez
always
rose
early
before
the
smoke
arose
before
the
first
cart
rattled
over
the
bridge
to
the
day
labour
in
the
fields
he
was
to
be
found
wandering
in
his
garden
now
he
would
pick
a
bunch
of
grapes
now
he
would
eat
a
big
pear
under
the
trellice
now
he
would
draw
all
sorts
of
fancies
on
the
path
with
the
end
of
his
cane
now
he
would
go
down
and
watch
the
river
running
endlessly
past
the
timber
place
at
which
he
moored
his
boat
there
was
no
time
he
used
to
say
for
making
theories
like
the
early
morning
rise
earlier
than
any
one
else
in
the
village
he
once
boasted
is
a
fair
consequence
that
i
know
more
and
wish
to
do
less
with
my
knowledge
the
doctor
was
a
connoisseur
of
sunrises
and
loved
a
good
theatrical
effect
to
usher
in
the
day
he
had
a
theory
of
dew
by
which
he
could
predict
the
weather
indeed
most
things
served
him
to
that
end
the
sound
of
the
bells
from
all
the
neighbouring
villages
the
smell
of
the
forest
the
visits
and
the
behaviour
of
both
birds
and
fishes
the
look
of
the
plants
in
his
garden
the
disposition
of
cloud
the
colour
of
the
light
and
last
although
not
least
the
arsenal
of
meteorological
instruments
in
a
hutch
upon
the
lawn
ever
since
he
had
settled
at
gretz
he
had
been
growing
more
and
more
into
the
local
meteorologist
the
unpaid
champion
of
the
local
climate
he
thought
at
first
there
was
no
place
so
healthful
in
the
arrondissement
by
the
end
of
the
second
year
he
protested
there
was
none
so
wholesome
in
the
whole
department
and
for
some
time
before
he
met
he
had
been
prepared
to
challenge
all
france
and
the
better
part
of
europe
for
a
rival
to
his
chosen
spot
he
would
say
is
a
foul
word
it
should
not
be
used
to
ladies
it
implies
disease
i
remark
it
as
a
flaw
in
our
civilisation
that
we
have
not
the
proper
horror
of
disease
now
i
for
my
part
have
washed
my
hands
of
it
i
have
renounced
my
laureation
i
am
no
doctor
i
am
only
a
worshipper
of
the
true
goddess
hygieia
ah
believe
me
it
is
she
who
has
the
cestus
and
here
in
this
exiguous
hamlet
has
she
placed
her
shrine
here
she
dwells
and
lavishes
her
gifts
here
i
walk
with
her
in
the
early
morning
and
she
shows
me
how
strong
she
has
made
the
peasants
how
fruitful
she
has
made
the
fields
how
the
trees
grow
up
tall
and
comely
under
her
eyes
and
the
fishes
in
the
river
become
clean
and
agile
at
her
rheumatism
he
would
cry
on
some
malapert
interruption
yes
i
believe
we
do
have
a
little
rheumatism
that
could
hardly
be
avoided
you
know
on
a
river
and
of
course
the
place
stands
a
little
low
and
the
meadows
are
marshy
there
no
doubt
but
my
dear
sir
look
at
bourron
bourron
stands
high
bourron
is
close
to
the
forest
plenty
of
ozone
there
you
would
say
well
compared
with
gretz
bourron
is
a
perfect
shambles
the
morning
after
he
had
been
summoned
to
the
dying
mountebank
the
doctor
visited
the
wharf
at
the
tail
of
his
garden
and
had
a
long
look
at
the
running
water
this
he
called
prayer
but
whether
his
adorations
were
addressed
to
the
goddess
hygieia
or
some
more
orthodox
deity
never
plainly
appeared
for
he
had
uttered
doubtful
oracles
sometimes
declaring
that
a
river
was
the
type
of
bodily
health
sometimes
extolling
it
as
the
great
moral
preacher
continually
preaching
peace
continuity
and
diligence
to
man
tormented
spirits
after
he
had
watched
a
mile
or
so
of
the
clear
water
running
by
before
his
eyes
seen
a
fish
or
two
come
to
the
surface
with
a
gleam
of
silver
and
sufficiently
admired
the
long
shadows
of
the
trees
falling
half
across
the
river
from
the
opposite
bank
with
patches
of
moving
sunlight
in
between
he
strolled
once
more
up
the
garden
and
through
his
house
into
the
street
feeling
cool
and
renovated
the
sound
of
his
feet
upon
the
causeway
began
the
business
of
the
day
for
the
village
was
still
sound
asleep
the
church
tower
looked
very
airy
in
the
sunlight
a
few
birds
that
turned
about
it
seemed
to
swim
in
an
atmosphere
of
more
than
usual
rarity
and
the
doctor
walking
in
long
transparent
shadows
filled
his
lungs
amply
and
proclaimed
himself
well
contented
with
the
morning
on
one
of
the
posts
before
tentaillon
carriage
entry
he
espied
a
little
dark
figure
perched
in
a
meditative
attitude
and
immediately
recognised
he
said
stopping
before
him
humorously
with
a
hand
on
either
knee
we
rise
early
in
the
morning
do
we
it
appears
to
me
that
we
have
all
the
vices
of
a
philosopher
the
boy
got
to
his
feet
and
made
a
grave
salutation
how
is
our
patient
asked
desprez
it
appeared
the
patient
was
about
the
same
why
do
you
rise
early
in
the
morning
he
pursued
after
a
long
silence
professed
that
he
hardly
knew
hardly
know
repeated
desprez
hardly
know
anything
my
man
until
we
try
to
learn
interrogate
your
consciousness
come
push
me
this
inquiry
home
do
you
like
it
said
the
boy
slowly
i
like
it
why
do
you
like
it
continued
the
doctor
we
are
now
pursuing
the
socratic
method
why
do
you
like
it
is
quiet
answered
i
have
nothing
to
do
and
then
i
feel
as
if
i
were
good
doctor
desprez
took
a
seat
on
the
post
at
the
opposite
side
he
was
beginning
to
take
an
interest
in
the
talk
for
the
boy
plainly
thought
before
he
spoke
and
tried
to
answer
truly
appears
you
have
a
taste
for
feeling
good
said
the
doctor
there
you
puzzle
me
extremely
for
i
thought
you
said
you
were
a
thief
and
the
two
are
incompatible
it
very
bad
to
steal
asked
is
the
general
opinion
little
boy
replied
the
doctor
but
i
mean
as
i
stole
explained
the
other
i
had
no
choice
i
think
it
is
surely
right
to
have
bread
it
must
be
right
to
have
bread
there
comes
so
plain
a
want
of
it
and
then
they
beat
me
cruelly
if
i
returned
with
nothing
he
added
was
not
ignorant
of
right
and
wrong
for
before
that
i
had
been
well
taught
by
a
priest
who
was
very
kind
to
me
the
doctor
made
a
horrible
grimace
at
the
word
it
seemed
to
me
when
one
had
nothing
to
eat
and
was
beaten
it
was
a
different
affair
i
would
not
have
stolen
for
tartlets
i
believe
but
any
one
would
steal
for
baker
bread
so
i
suppose
said
the
doctor
with
a
rising
sneer
prayed
god
to
forgive
you
and
explained
the
case
to
him
at
length
sir
asked
do
not
see
priest
would
see
however
retorted
desprez
he
asked
the
boy
troubled
for
the
first
time
should
have
thought
god
would
have
known
snarled
the
doctor
should
have
thought
god
would
have
understood
me
replied
the
other
do
not
i
see
but
then
it
was
god
that
made
me
think
so
was
it
not
boy
little
boy
said
desprez
told
you
already
you
had
the
vices
of
philosophy
if
you
display
the
virtues
also
i
must
go
i
am
a
student
of
the
blessed
laws
of
health
an
observer
of
plain
and
temperate
nature
in
her
common
walks
and
i
can
not
preserve
my
equanimity
in
presence
of
a
monster
do
you
understand
sir
said
the
boy
will
make
my
meaning
clear
to
you
replied
the
doctor
there
at
the
sky
behind
the
belfry
first
where
it
is
so
light
and
then
up
and
up
turning
your
chin
back
right
to
the
top
of
the
dome
where
it
is
already
as
blue
as
at
noon
is
not
that
a
beautiful
colour
does
it
not
please
the
heart
we
have
seen
it
all
our
lives
until
it
has
grown
in
with
our
familiar
thoughts
now
changing
his
tone
that
sky
to
become
suddenly
of
a
live
and
fiery
amber
like
the
colour
of
clear
coals
and
growing
scarlet
towards
the
top
i
do
not
say
it
would
be
any
the
less
beautiful
but
would
you
like
it
as
well
suppose
not
answered
do
i
like
you
returned
the
doctor
roughly
hate
all
odd
people
and
you
are
the
most
curious
little
boy
in
all
the
world
seemed
to
ponder
for
a
while
and
then
he
raised
his
head
again
and
looked
over
at
the
doctor
with
an
air
of
candid
inquiry
are
not
you
a
very
curious
gentleman
he
asked
the
doctor
threw
away
his
stick
bounded
on
the
boy
clasped
him
to
his
bosom
and
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
admirable
imp
he
cried
a
morning
what
an
hour
for
a
theorist
of
no
he
continued
apostrophising
heaven
did
not
know
such
boys
existed
i
was
ignorant
they
made
them
so
i
had
doubted
of
my
race
and
now
it
is
like
he
added
picking
up
his
stick
a
lovers
meeting
i
have
bruised
my
favourite
staff
in
that
moment
of
enthusiasm
the
injury
however
is
not
grave
he
caught
the
boy
looking
at
him
in
obvious
wonder
embarrassment
and
alarm
said
he
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
egad
i
believe
the
boy
despises
me
do
you
despise
me
boy
no
replied
seriously
i
do
not
understand
must
excuse
me
sir
returned
the
doctor
with
gravity
am
still
so
young
o
hang
him
he
added
to
himself
and
he
took
his
seat
again
and
observed
the
boy
sardonically
has
spoiled
the
quiet
of
my
morning
thought
he
shall
be
nervous
all
day
and
have
a
febricule
when
i
digest
let
me
compose
myself
and
so
he
dismissed
his
by
an
effort
of
the
will
which
he
had
long
practised
and
let
his
soul
roam
abroad
in
the
contemplation
of
the
morning
he
inhaled
the
air
tasting
it
critically
as
a
connoisseur
tastes
a
vintage
and
prolonging
the
expiration
with
hygienic
gusto
he
counted
the
little
flecks
of
cloud
along
the
sky
he
followed
the
movements
of
the
birds
round
the
church
tower
making
long
sweeps
hanging
poised
or
turning
airy
somersaults
in
fancy
and
beating
the
wind
with
imaginary
pinions
and
in
this
way
he
regained
peace
of
mind
and
animal
composure
conscious
of
his
limbs
conscious
of
the
sight
of
his
eyes
conscious
that
the
air
had
a
cool
taste
like
a
fruit
at
the
top
of
his
throat
and
at
last
in
complete
abstraction
he
began
to
sing
the
doctor
had
but
one
air
guerre
even
with
that
he
was
on
terms
of
mere
politeness
and
his
musical
exploits
were
always
reserved
for
moments
when
he
was
alone
and
entirely
happy
he
was
recalled
to
earth
rudely
by
a
pained
expression
on
the
boy
face
do
you
think
of
my
singing
he
inquired
stopping
in
the
middle
of
a
note
and
then
after
he
had
waited
some
little
while
and
received
no
answer
do
you
think
of
my
singing
he
repeated
imperiously
do
not
like
it
faltered
come
cried
the
doctor
you
are
a
performer
yourself
sing
better
than
that
replied
the
boy
the
doctor
eyed
him
for
some
seconds
in
stupefaction
he
was
aware
that
he
was
angry
and
blushed
for
himself
in
consequence
which
made
him
angrier
this
is
how
you
address
your
master
he
said
at
last
with
a
shrug
and
a
flourish
of
his
arms
do
not
speak
to
him
at
all
returned
the
boy
do
not
like
him
you
like
me
snapped
doctor
desprez
with
unusual
eagerness
do
not
know
answered
the
doctor
rose
shall
wish
you
a
good
morning
he
said
are
too
much
for
me
perhaps
you
have
blood
in
your
veins
perhaps
celestial
ichor
or
perhaps
you
circulate
nothing
more
gross
than
respirable
air
but
of
one
thing
i
am
inexpugnably
assured
that
you
are
no
human
being
no
boy
shaking
his
stick
at
him
are
not
a
human
being
write
write
it
in
your
memory
i
am
not
a
human
being
i
have
no
pretension
to
be
a
human
being
i
am
a
dive
a
dream
an
angel
an
acrostic
an
illusion
what
you
please
but
not
a
human
being
and
so
accept
my
humble
salutations
and
farewell
and
with
that
the
doctor
made
off
along
the
street
in
some
emotion
and
the
boy
stood
mentally
gaping
where
he
left
him
chapter
iii
the
adoption
madame
desprez
who
answered
to
the
christian
name
of
anastasie
presented
an
agreeable
type
of
her
sex
exceedingly
wholesome
to
look
upon
a
stout
with
cool
smooth
cheeks
steady
dark
eyes
and
hands
that
neither
art
nor
nature
could
improve
she
was
the
sort
of
person
over
whom
adversity
passes
like
a
summer
cloud
she
might
in
the
worst
of
conjunctions
knit
her
brows
into
one
vertical
furrow
for
a
moment
but
the
next
it
would
be
gone
she
had
much
of
the
placidity
of
a
contented
nun
with
little
of
her
piety
however
for
anastasie
was
of
a
very
mundane
nature
fond
of
oysters
and
old
wine
and
somewhat
bold
pleasantries
and
devoted
to
her
husband
for
her
own
sake
rather
than
for
his
she
was
imperturbably
but
had
no
idea
of
to
live
in
that
pleasant
old
house
with
a
green
garden
behind
and
bright
flowers
about
the
window
to
eat
and
drink
of
the
best
to
gossip
with
a
neighbour
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
never
to
wear
stays
or
a
dress
except
when
she
went
to
fontainebleau
shopping
to
be
kept
in
a
continual
supply
of
racy
novels
and
to
be
married
to
doctor
desprez
and
have
no
ground
of
jealousy
filled
the
cup
of
her
nature
to
the
brim
those
who
had
known
the
doctor
in
bachelor
days
when
he
had
aired
quite
as
many
theories
but
of
a
different
order
attributed
his
present
philosophy
to
the
study
of
anastasie
it
was
her
brute
enjoyment
that
he
rationalised
and
perhaps
vainly
imitated
madame
desprez
was
an
artist
in
the
kitchen
and
made
coffee
to
a
nicety
she
had
a
knack
of
tidiness
with
which
she
had
infected
the
doctor
everything
was
in
its
place
everything
capable
of
polish
shone
gloriously
and
dust
was
a
thing
banished
from
her
empire
aline
their
single
servant
had
no
other
business
in
the
world
but
to
scour
and
burnish
so
doctor
desprez
lived
in
his
house
like
a
fatted
calf
warmed
and
cosseted
to
his
heart
content
the
midday
meal
was
excellent
there
was
a
ripe
melon
a
fish
from
the
river
in
a
memorable
bearnaise
sauce
a
fat
fowl
in
a
fricassee
and
a
dish
of
asparagus
followed
by
some
fruit
the
doctor
drank
half
a
bottle
one
glass
the
wife
half
a
bottle
the
same
quantity
which
was
a
marital
privilege
of
an
excellent
seven
years
old
then
the
coffee
was
brought
and
a
flask
of
chartreuse
for
madame
for
the
doctor
despised
and
distrusted
such
decoctions
and
then
aline
left
the
wedded
pair
to
the
pleasures
of
memory
and
digestion
is
a
very
fortunate
circumstance
my
cherished
one
observed
the
doctor
coffee
is
adorable
a
very
fortunate
circumstance
upon
the
whole
anastasie
i
beseech
you
go
without
that
poison
for
only
one
day
and
you
will
feel
the
benefit
i
pledge
my
reputation
is
this
fortunate
circumstance
my
friend
inquired
anastasie
not
heeding
his
protest
which
was
of
daily
recurrence
we
have
no
children
my
beautiful
replied
the
doctor
think
of
it
more
and
more
as
the
years
go
on
and
with
more
and
more
gratitude
towards
the
power
that
dispenses
such
afflictions
your
health
my
darling
my
studious
quiet
our
little
kitchen
delicacies
how
they
would
all
have
suffered
how
they
would
all
have
been
sacrificed
and
for
what
children
are
the
last
word
of
human
imperfection
health
flees
before
their
face
they
cry
my
dear
they
put
vexatious
questions
they
demand
to
be
fed
to
be
washed
to
be
educated
to
have
their
noses
blown
and
then
when
the
time
comes
they
break
our
hearts
as
i
break
this
piece
of
sugar
a
pair
of
professed
egoists
like
you
and
me
should
avoid
offspring
like
an
infidelity
said
she
and
she
laughed
that
is
like
you
to
take
credit
for
the
thing
you
could
not
help
dear
returned
the
doctor
solemnly
might
have
adopted
cried
madame
doctor
with
my
consent
if
the
child
were
my
own
flesh
and
blood
i
would
not
say
no
but
to
take
another
person
indiscretion
on
my
shoulders
my
dear
friend
i
have
too
much
sense
replied
the
doctor
both
had
and
i
am
all
the
better
pleased
with
our
wisdom
because
because
he
looked
at
her
sharply
what
she
asked
with
a
faint
premonition
of
danger
i
have
found
the
right
person
said
the
doctor
firmly
shall
adopt
him
this
afternoon
anastasie
looked
at
him
out
of
a
mist
have
lost
your
reason
she
said
and
there
was
a
clang
in
her
voice
that
seemed
to
threaten
trouble
so
my
dear
he
replied
retain
its
complete
exercise
to
the
proof
instead
of
attempting
to
cloak
my
inconsistency
i
have
by
way
of
preparing
you
thrown
it
into
strong
relief
you
will
there
i
think
recognise
the
philosopher
who
has
the
ecstasy
to
call
you
wife
the
fact
is
i
have
been
reckoning
all
this
while
without
an
accident
i
never
thought
to
find
a
son
of
my
own
now
last
night
i
found
one
do
not
unnecessarily
alarm
yourself
my
dear
he
is
not
a
drop
of
blood
to
me
that
i
know
it
is
his
mind
darling
his
mind
that
calls
me
father
mind
she
repeated
with
a
titter
between
scorn
and
hysterics
mind
indeed
henri
is
this
an
idiotic
pleasantry
or
are
you
mad
his
mind
and
what
of
my
mind
replied
the
doctor
with
a
shrug
have
your
finger
on
the
hitch
he
will
be
strikingly
antipathetic
to
my
ever
beautiful
anastasie
she
will
never
understand
him
he
will
never
understand
her
you
married
the
animal
side
of
my
nature
dear
and
it
is
on
the
spiritual
side
that
i
find
my
affinity
for
so
much
so
that
to
be
perfectly
frank
i
stand
in
some
awe
of
him
myself
you
will
easily
perceive
that
i
am
announcing
a
calamity
for
you
do
not
he
broke
out
in
tones
of
real
solicitude
not
give
way
to
tears
after
a
meal
anastasie
you
will
certainly
give
yourself
a
false
digestion
anastasie
controlled
herself
know
how
willing
i
am
to
humour
you
she
said
all
reasonable
matters
but
on
this
point
dear
love
interrupted
the
doctor
eager
to
prevent
a
refusal
wished
to
leave
paris
who
made
me
give
up
cards
and
the
opera
and
the
boulevard
and
my
social
relations
and
all
that
was
my
life
before
i
knew
you
have
i
been
faithful
have
i
been
obedient
have
i
not
borne
my
doom
with
cheerfulness
in
all
honesty
anastasie
have
i
not
a
right
to
a
stipulation
on
my
side
i
have
and
you
know
it
i
stipulate
my
son
anastasie
was
aware
of
defeat
she
struck
her
colours
instantly
will
break
my
heart
she
sighed
in
the
least
said
he
will
feel
a
trifling
inconvenience
for
a
month
just
as
i
did
when
i
was
first
brought
to
this
vile
hamlet
then
your
admirable
sense
and
temper
will
prevail
and
i
see
you
already
as
content
as
ever
and
making
your
husband
the
happiest
of
men
know
i
can
refuse
you
nothing
she
said
with
a
last
flicker
of
resistance
that
will
make
you
truly
happier
but
will
this
are
you
sure
my
husband
last
night
you
say
you
found
him
he
may
be
the
worst
of
humbugs
think
not
replied
the
doctor
do
not
suppose
me
so
unwary
as
to
adopt
him
out
of
hand
i
am
i
flatter
myself
a
finished
man
of
the
world
i
have
had
all
possibilities
in
view
my
plan
is
contrived
to
meet
them
all
i
take
the
lad
as
stable
boy
if
he
pilfer
if
he
grumble
if
he
desire
to
change
i
shall
see
i
was
mistaken
i
shall
recognise
him
for
no
son
of
mine
and
send
him
tramping
will
never
do
so
when
the
time
comes
said
his
wife
know
your
good
heart
she
reached
out
her
hand
to
him
with
a
sigh
the
doctor
smiled
as
he
took
it
and
carried
it
to
his
lips
he
had
gained
his
point
with
greater
ease
than
he
had
dared
to
hope
for
perhaps
the
twentieth
time
he
had
proved
the
efficacy
of
his
trusty
argument
his
excalibur
the
hint
of
a
return
to
paris
six
months
in
the
capital
for
a
man
of
the
antecedents
and
relations
implied
no
less
a
calamity
than
total
ruin
anastasie
had
saved
the
remainder
of
his
fortune
by
keeping
him
strictly
in
the
country
the
very
name
of
paris
put
her
in
a
blue
fear
and
she
would
have
allowed
her
husband
to
keep
a
menagerie
in
the
back
garden
let
alone
adopting
a
rather
than
permit
the
question
of
return
to
be
discussed
about
four
of
the
afternoon
the
mountebank
rendered
up
his
ghost
he
had
never
been
conscious
since
his
seizure
doctor
desprez
was
present
at
his
last
passage
and
declared
the
farce
over
then
he
took
by
the
shoulder
and
led
him
out
into
the
inn
garden
where
there
was
a
convenient
bench
beside
the
river
here
he
sat
him
down
and
made
the
boy
place
himself
on
his
left
he
said
very
gravely
world
is
exceedingly
vast
and
even
france
which
is
only
a
small
corner
of
it
is
a
great
place
for
a
little
lad
like
you
unfortunately
it
is
full
of
eager
shouldering
people
moving
on
and
there
are
very
few
bakers
shops
for
so
many
eaters
your
master
is
dead
you
are
not
fit
to
gain
a
living
by
yourself
you
do
not
wish
to
steal
no
your
situation
then
is
undesirable
it
is
for
the
moment
critical
on
the
other
hand
you
behold
in
me
a
man
not
old
though
elderly
still
enjoying
the
youth
of
the
heart
and
the
intelligence
a
man
of
instruction
easily
situated
in
this
world
affairs
keeping
a
good
table
a
man
neither
as
friend
nor
host
to
be
despised
i
offer
you
your
food
and
clothes
and
to
teach
you
lessons
in
the
evening
which
will
be
infinitely
more
to
the
purpose
for
a
lad
of
your
stamp
than
those
of
all
the
priests
in
europe
i
propose
no
wages
but
if
ever
you
take
a
thought
to
leave
me
the
door
shall
be
open
and
i
will
give
you
a
hundred
francs
to
start
the
world
upon
in
return
i
have
an
old
horse
and
chaise
which
you
would
very
speedily
learn
to
clean
and
keep
in
order
do
not
hurry
yourself
to
answer
and
take
it
or
leave
it
as
you
judge
aright
only
remember
this
that
i
am
no
sentimentalist
or
charitable
person
but
a
man
who
lives
rigorously
to
himself
and
that
if
i
make
the
proposal
it
is
for
my
own
ends
it
is
because
i
perceive
clearly
an
advantage
to
myself
and
now
reflect
shall
be
very
glad
i
do
not
see
what
else
i
can
do
i
thank
you
sir
most
kindly
and
i
will
try
to
be
useful
said
the
boy
you
said
the
doctor
warmly
rising
at
the
same
time
and
wiping
his
brow
for
he
had
suffered
agonies
while
the
thing
hung
in
the
wind
a
refusal
after
the
scene
at
noon
would
have
placed
him
in
a
ridiculous
light
before
anastasie
hot
and
heavy
is
the
evening
to
be
sure
i
have
always
had
a
fancy
to
be
a
fish
in
summer
here
in
the
loing
beside
gretz
i
should
lie
under
a
and
listen
to
the
bells
which
must
sound
most
delicately
down
below
that
would
be
a
life
do
you
not
think
so
too
said
god
you
have
imagination
cried
the
doctor
embracing
the
boy
with
his
usual
effusive
warmth
though
it
was
a
proceeding
that
seemed
to
disconcert
the
sufferer
almost
as
much
as
if
he
had
been
an
english
schoolboy
of
the
same
age
now
he
added
will
take
you
to
my
wife
madame
desprez
sat
in
the
in
a
cool
wrapper
all
the
blinds
were
down
and
the
tile
floor
had
been
recently
sprinkled
with
water
her
eyes
were
half
shut
but
she
affected
to
be
reading
a
novel
as
the
they
entered
though
she
was
a
bustling
woman
she
enjoyed
repose
between
whiles
and
had
a
remarkable
appetite
for
sleep
the
doctor
went
through
a
solemn
form
of
introduction
adding
for
the
benefit
of
both
parties
must
try
to
like
each
other
for
my
sake
is
very
pretty
said
anastasie
you
kiss
me
my
pretty
little
fellow
the
doctor
was
furious
and
dragged
her
into
the
passage
you
a
fool
anastasie
he
said
is
all
this
i
hear
about
the
tact
of
women
heaven
knows
i
have
not
met
with
it
in
my
experience
you
address
my
little
philosopher
as
if
he
were
an
infant
he
must
be
spoken
to
with
more
respect
i
tell
you
he
must
not
be
kissed
and
like
an
ordinary
child
only
did
it
to
please
you
i
am
sure
replied
anastasie
i
will
try
to
do
better
the
doctor
apologised
for
his
warmth
i
do
wish
him
he
continued
feel
at
home
among
us
and
really
your
conduct
was
so
idiotic
my
cherished
one
and
so
utterly
and
distantly
out
of
place
that
a
saint
might
have
been
pardoned
a
little
vehemence
in
disapproval
do
do
try
if
it
is
possible
for
a
woman
to
understand
young
people
but
of
course
it
is
not
and
i
waste
my
breath
hold
your
tongue
as
much
as
possible
at
least
and
observe
my
conduct
narrowly
it
will
serve
you
for
a
model
anastasie
did
as
she
was
bidden
and
considered
the
doctor
behaviour
she
observed
that
he
embraced
the
boy
three
times
in
the
course
of
the
evening
and
managed
generally
to
confound
and
abash
the
little
fellow
out
of
speech
and
appetite
but
she
had
the
true
womanly
heroism
in
little
affairs
not
only
did
she
refrain
from
the
cheap
revenge
of
exposing
the
doctor
errors
to
himself
but
she
did
her
best
to
remove
their
on
when
desprez
went
out
for
his
last
breath
of
air
before
retiring
for
the
night
she
came
over
to
the
side
and
took
his
hand
must
not
be
surprised
nor
frightened
by
my
husband
manners
she
said
is
the
kindest
of
men
but
so
clever
that
he
is
sometimes
difficult
to
understand
you
will
soon
grow
used
to
him
and
then
you
will
love
him
for
that
nobody
can
help
as
for
me
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
try
to
make
you
happy
and
will
not
bother
you
at
all
i
think
we
should
be
excellent
friends
you
and
i
am
not
clever
but
i
am
very
will
you
give
me
a
kiss
he
held
up
his
face
and
she
took
him
in
her
arms
and
then
began
to
cry
the
woman
had
spoken
in
complaisance
but
she
had
warmed
to
her
own
words
and
tenderness
followed
the
doctor
entering
found
them
enlaced
he
concluded
that
his
wife
was
in
fault
and
he
was
just
beginning
in
an
awful
voice
when
she
looked
up
at
him
smiling
with
an
upraised
finger
and
he
held
his
peace
wondering
while
she
led
the
boy
to
his
attic
chapter
iv
the
education
of
a
philosopher
the
installation
of
the
adopted
was
thus
happily
effected
and
the
wheels
of
life
continued
to
run
smoothly
in
the
doctor
house
marie
did
his
horse
and
carriage
duty
in
the
morning
sometimes
helped
in
the
housework
sometimes
walked
abroad
with
the
doctor
to
drink
wisdom
from
the
and
was
introduced
at
night
to
the
sciences
and
the
dead
tongues
he
retained
his
singular
placidity
of
mind
and
manner
he
was
rarely
in
fault
but
he
made
only
a
very
partial
progress
in
his
studies
and
remained
much
of
a
stranger
in
the
family
the
doctor
was
a
pattern
of
regularity
all
forenoon
he
worked
on
his
great
book
the
pharmacopoeia
or
historical
dictionary
of
all
medicines
which
as
yet
consisted
principally
of
slips
of
paper
and
pins
when
finished
it
was
to
fill
many
personable
volumes
and
to
combine
antiquarian
interest
with
professional
utility
but
the
doctor
was
studious
of
literary
graces
and
the
picturesque
an
anecdote
a
touch
of
manners
a
moral
qualification
or
a
sounding
epithet
was
sure
to
be
preferred
before
a
piece
of
science
a
little
more
and
he
would
have
written
the
pharmacopoeia
in
verse
the
article
for
instance
was
already
complete
though
the
remainder
of
the
work
had
not
progressed
beyond
the
letter
a
it
was
exceedingly
copious
and
entertaining
written
with
quaintness
and
colour
exact
erudite
a
literary
article
but
it
would
hardly
have
afforded
guidance
to
a
practising
physician
of
the
feminine
good
sense
of
his
wife
had
led
her
to
point
this
out
with
uncompromising
sincerity
for
the
dictionary
was
duly
read
aloud
to
her
betwixt
sleep
and
waning
as
it
proceeded
towards
an
infinitely
distant
completion
and
the
doctor
was
a
little
sore
on
the
subject
of
mummies
and
sometimes
resented
an
allusion
with
asperity
after
the
midday
meal
and
a
proper
period
of
digestion
he
walked
sometimes
alone
sometimes
accompanied
by
for
madame
would
have
preferred
any
hardship
rather
than
walk
she
was
as
i
have
said
a
very
busy
person
continually
occupied
about
material
comforts
and
ready
to
drop
asleep
over
a
novel
the
instant
she
was
disengaged
this
was
the
less
objectionable
as
she
never
snored
or
grew
distempered
in
complexion
when
she
slept
on
the
contrary
she
looked
the
very
picture
of
luxurious
and
appetising
ease
and
woke
without
a
start
to
the
perfect
possession
of
her
faculties
i
am
afraid
she
was
greatly
an
animal
but
she
was
a
very
nice
animal
to
have
about
in
this
way
she
had
little
to
do
with
but
the
sympathy
which
had
been
established
between
them
on
the
first
night
remained
unbroken
they
held
occasional
conversations
mostly
on
household
matters
to
the
extreme
disappointment
of
the
doctor
they
occasionally
sallied
off
together
to
that
temple
of
debasing
superstition
the
village
church
madame
and
he
both
in
their
sunday
best
drove
twice
a
month
to
fontainebleau
and
returned
laden
with
purchases
and
in
short
although
the
doctor
still
continued
to
regard
them
as
irreconcilably
their
relation
was
as
intimate
friendly
and
confidential
as
their
natures
suffered
i
fear
however
that
in
her
heart
of
hearts
madame
kindly
despised
and
pitied
the
boy
she
had
no
admiration
for
his
class
of
virtues
she
liked
a
smart
polite
forward
roguish
sort
of
boy
cap
in
hand
light
of
foot
meeting
the
eye
she
liked
volubility
charm
a
little
vice
the
promise
of
a
second
doctor
desprez
and
it
was
her
indefeasible
belief
that
was
dull
dear
boy
she
had
said
once
sad
it
is
that
he
should
be
so
stupid
she
had
never
repeated
that
remark
for
the
doctor
had
raged
like
a
wild
bull
denouncing
the
brutal
bluntness
of
her
mind
bemoaning
his
own
fate
to
be
so
unequally
mated
with
an
ass
and
what
touched
anastasie
more
nearly
menacing
the
table
china
by
the
fury
of
his
gesticulations
but
she
adhered
silently
to
her
opinion
and
when
was
sitting
stolid
blank
but
not
unhappy
over
his
unfinished
tasks
she
would
snatch
her
opportunity
in
the
doctor
absence
go
over
to
him
put
her
arms
about
his
neck
lay
her
cheek
to
his
and
communicate
her
sympathy
with
his
distress
not
mind
she
would
say
too
am
not
at
all
clever
and
i
can
assure
you
that
it
makes
no
difference
in
life
the
doctor
view
was
naturally
different
that
gentleman
never
wearied
of
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
which
was
to
say
the
truth
agreeable
enough
to
hear
he
now
had
a
listener
who
was
not
so
cynically
indifferent
as
anastasie
and
who
sometimes
put
him
on
his
mettle
by
the
most
relevant
objections
besides
was
he
not
educating
the
boy
and
education
philosophers
are
agreed
is
the
most
philosophical
of
duties
what
can
be
more
heavenly
to
poor
mankind
than
to
have
one
hobby
grow
into
a
duty
to
the
state
then
indeed
do
the
ways
of
life
become
ways
of
pleasantness
never
had
the
doctor
seen
reason
to
be
more
content
with
his
endowments
philosophy
flowed
smoothly
from
his
lips
he
was
so
agile
a
dialectician
that
he
could
trace
his
nonsense
when
challenged
back
to
some
root
in
sense
and
prove
it
to
be
a
sort
of
flower
upon
his
system
he
slipped
out
of
antinomies
like
a
fish
and
left
his
disciple
marvelling
at
the
rabbi
depth
moreover
deep
down
in
his
heart
the
doctor
was
disappointed
with
the
success
of
his
more
formal
education
a
boy
chosen
by
so
acute
an
observer
for
his
aptitude
and
guided
along
the
path
of
learning
by
so
philosophic
an
instructor
was
bound
by
the
nature
of
the
universe
to
make
a
more
obvious
and
lasting
advance
now
was
slow
in
all
things
impenetrable
in
others
and
his
power
of
forgetting
was
fully
on
a
level
with
his
power
to
learn
therefore
the
doctor
cherished
his
peripatetic
lectures
to
which
the
boy
attended
which
he
generally
appeared
to
enjoy
and
by
which
he
often
profited
many
and
many
were
the
talks
they
had
together
and
health
and
moderation
proved
the
subject
of
the
doctor
divagations
to
these
he
lovingly
returned
lead
you
he
would
say
the
green
pastures
my
system
my
beliefs
my
medicines
are
resumed
in
one
phrase
to
avoid
excess
blessed
nature
healthy
temperate
nature
abhors
and
exterminates
excess
human
law
in
this
matter
imitates
at
a
great
distance
her
provisions
and
we
must
strive
to
supplement
the
efforts
of
the
law
yes
boy
we
must
be
a
law
to
ourselves
and
for
ourselves
and
for
our
neighbours
lex
armata
armed
emphatic
tyrannous
law
if
you
see
a
crapulous
human
ruin
snuffing
dash
from
him
his
box
the
judge
though
in
a
way
an
admission
of
disease
is
less
offensive
to
me
than
either
the
doctor
or
the
priest
above
all
the
doctor
the
doctor
and
the
purulent
trash
and
garbage
of
his
pharmacopoeia
pure
air
from
the
neighbourhood
of
a
pinetum
for
the
sake
of
the
turpentine
unadulterated
wine
and
the
reflections
of
an
unsophisticated
spirit
in
the
presence
of
the
works
of
nature
these
my
boy
are
the
best
medical
appliances
and
the
best
religious
comforts
devote
yourself
to
these
hark
there
are
the
bells
of
bourron
the
wind
is
in
the
north
it
will
be
fair
how
clear
and
airy
is
the
sound
the
nerves
are
harmonised
and
quieted
the
mind
attuned
to
silence
and
observe
how
easily
and
regularly
beats
the
heart
your
unenlightened
doctor
would
see
nothing
in
these
sensations
and
yet
you
yourself
perceive
they
are
a
part
of
did
you
remember
your
cinchona
this
morning
good
cinchona
also
is
a
work
of
nature
it
is
after
all
only
the
bark
of
a
tree
which
we
might
gather
for
ourselves
if
we
lived
in
the
what
a
world
is
this
though
a
professed
atheist
i
delight
to
bear
my
testimony
to
the

look
at
the
gratuitous
remedies
and
pleasures
that
surround
our
path
the

our

our

our

system
of
drainage
there
is
a

the
court
which
sends
up
sparkling
water
from
the
earth
very

clean
cool
and
with
a
little
wine
most
wholesome
the
district
is
notorious
for
its
salubrity
rheumatism
is
the
only
prevalent
complaint
and
i
myself
have
never
had
a
touch
of
it
i
tell
you
and
my
opinion
is
based
upon
the
coldest
clearest
processes
of
reason
if
i
if
you
desired
to
leave
this
home
of
pleasures
it
would
be
the
duty
it
would
be
the
privilege
of
our
best
friend
to
prevent
us
with
a
pistol
bullet
one
beautiful
june
day
they
sat
upon
the
hill
outside
the
village
the
river
as
blue
as
heaven
shone
here
and
there
among
the
foliage
the
indefatigable
birds
turned
and
flickered
about
gretz
church
tower
a
healthy
wind
blew
from
over
the
forest
and
the
sound
of
innumerable
thousands
of
and
innumerable
millions
on
millions
of
green
leaves
was
abroad
in
the
air
and
filled
the
ear
with
something
between
whispered
speech
and
singing
it
seemed
as
if
every
blade
of
grass
must
hide
a
cigale
and
the
fields
rang
merrily
with
their
music
jingling
far
and
near
as
with
the
of
the
fairy
queen
from
their
station
on
the
slope
the
eye
embraced
a
large
space
of
poplar
plain
upon
the
one
hand
the
waving
of
the
forest
on
the
other
and
gretz
itself
in
the
middle
a
handful
of
roofs
under
the
bestriding
arch
of
the
blue
heavens
the
place
seemed
dwindled
to
a
toy
it
seemed
incredible
that
people
dwelt
and
could
find
room
to
turn
or
air
to
breathe
in
such
a
corner
of
the
world
the
thought
came
home
to
the
boy
perhaps
for
the
first
time
and
he
gave
it
words
small
it
looks
he
sighed
replied
the
doctor
enough
now
yet
it
was
once
a
walled
city
thriving
full
of
furred
burgesses
and
men
in
armour
humming
with
affairs
with
tall
spires
for
aught
that
i
know
and
portly
towers
along
the
battlements
a
thousand
chimneys
ceased
smoking
at
the
curfew
bell
there
were
gibbets
at
the
gate
as
thick
as
scarecrows
in
time
of
war
the
assault
swarmed
against
it
with
ladders
the
arrows
fell
like
leaves
the
defenders
sallied
hotly
over
the
drawbridge
each
side
uttered
its
cry
as
they
plied
their
weapons
do
you
know
that
the
walls
extended
as
far
as
the
commanderie
tradition
so
reports
alas
what
a
long
way
off
is
all
this
confusion
nothing
left
of
it
but
my
quiet
words
spoken
in
your
ear
and
the
town
itself
shrunk
to
the
hamlet
underneath
us
came
the
english
wars
you
shall
hear
more
of
the
english
a
stupid
people
who
sometimes
blundered
into
good
and
gretz
was
taken
sacked
and
burned
it
is
the
history
of
many
towns
but
gretz
never
rose
again
it
was
never
rebuilt
its
ruins
were
a
quarry
to
serve
the
growth
of
rivals
and
the
stones
of
gretz
are
now
erect
along
the
streets
of
nemours
it
gratifies
me
that
our
old
house
was
the
first
to
rise
after
the
calamity
when
the
town
had
come
to
an
end
it
inaugurated
the
hamlet
too
am
glad
of
that
said
should
be
the
temple
of
the
humbler
virtues
responded
the
doctor
with
a
savoury
gusto
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
love
my
little
hamlet
as
i
do
is
that
we
have
a
similar
history
she
and
i
have
i
told
you
that
i
was
once
rich
do
not
think
so
answered
do
not
think
i
should
have
forgotten
i
am
sorry
you
should
have
lost
your
fortune
cried
the
doctor
i
find
i
have
scarce
begun
your
education
after
all
listen
to
me
would
you
rather
live
in
the
old
gretz
or
in
the
new
free
from
the
alarms
of
war
with
the
green
country
at
the
door
without
noise
passports
the
exactions
of
the
soldiery
or
the
jangle
of
the
to
send
us
off
to
bed
by
sundown
suppose
i
should
prefer
the
new
replied
the
boy
returned
the
doctor
do
i
and
in
the
same
way
i
prefer
my
present
moderate
fortune
to
my
former
wealth
golden
mediocrity
cried
the
adorable
ancients
and
i
subscribe
to
their
enthusiasm
have
i
not
good
wine
good
food
good
air
the
fields
and
the
forest
for
my
walk
a
house
an
admirable
wife
a
boy
whom
i
protest
i
cherish
like
a
son
now
if
i
were
still
rich
i
should
indubitably
make
my
residence
in
paris
you
know
paris
paris
and
paradise
are
not
convertible
terms
this
pleasant
noise
of
the
wind
streaming
among
leaves
changed
into
the
grinding
babel
of
the
street
the
stupid
glare
of
plaster
substituted
for
this
quiet
pattern
of
greens
and
greys
the
nerves
shattered
the
digestion
falsified
picture
the
fall
already
you
perceive
the
consequences
the
mind
is
stimulated
the
heart
steps
to
a
different
measure
and
the
man
is
himself
no
longer
i
have
passionately
studied
myself
the
true
business
of
philosophy
i
know
my
character
as
the
musician
knows
the
ventages
of
his
flute
should
i
return
to
paris
i
should
ruin
myself
gambling
nay
i
go
further
i
should
break
the
heart
of
my
anastasie
with
infidelities
this
was
too
much
for
that
a
place
should
so
transform
the
most
excellent
of
men
transcended
his
belief
paris
he
protested
was
even
an
agreeable
place
of
residence
when
i
lived
in
that
city
did
i
feel
much
difference
he
pleaded
cried
the
doctor
you
not
steal
when
you
were
there
but
the
boy
could
never
be
brought
to
see
that
he
had
done
anything
wrong
when
he
stole
nor
indeed
did
the
doctor
think
he
had
but
that
gentleman
was
never
very
scrupulous
when
in
want
of
a
retort
now
he
concluded
you
begin
to
understand
my
only
friends
were
those
who
ruined
me
gretz
has
been
my
academy
my
sanatorium
my
heaven
of
innocent
pleasures
if
millions
are
offered
me
i
wave
them
back
evil
one
begone
fix
your
mind
on
my
example
despise
riches
avoid
the
debasing
influence
of
cities
hygiene
hygiene
and
mediocrity
of
fortune
these
be
your
watchwords
during
life
the
doctor
system
of
hygiene
strikingly
coincided
with
his
tastes
and
his
picture
of
the
perfect
life
was
a
faithful
description
of
the
one
he
was
leading
at
the
time
but
it
is
easy
to
convince
a
boy
whom
you
supply
with
all
the
facts
for
the
discussion
and
besides
there
was
one
thing
admirable
in
the
philosophy
and
that
was
the
enthusiasm
of
the
philosopher
there
was
never
any
one
more
vigorously
determined
to
be
pleased
and
if
he
was
not
a
great
logician
and
so
had
no
right
to
convince
the
intellect
he
was
certainly
something
of
a
poet
and
had
a
fascination
to
seduce
the
heart
what
he
could
not
achieve
in
his
customary
humour
of
a
radiant
admiration
of
himself
and
his
circumstances
he
sometimes
effected
in
his
fits
of
gloom
he
would
say
me
if
i
were
superstitious
i
should
even
beg
for
an
interest
in
your
prayers
i
am
in
the
black
fit
the
evil
spirit
of
king
saul
the
hag
of
the

the
personal

of
the
mediaeval

breast

of
my
nature
are
now
uppermost
innocent
pleasures
woo
me
in
vain
i
long
for
paris
for
my
wallowing
in
the
mire
see
he
would
continue
producing
a
handful
of
silver
denude
myself
i
am
not
to
be

the

of

disown

not

wreck
the
train
i
speak
of

by
a
parable
any
extremity
were
better
than
for
me
to
reach
paris
alive
doubtless
the
doctor
enjoyed
these
little
scenes
as
a
variation
in
his
part
they
represented
the
byronic
element
in
the
somewhat
artificial
poetry
of
his
existence
but
to
the
boy
though
he
was
dimly
aware
of
their
theatricality
they
represented
more
the
doctor
made
perhaps
too
little
the
boy
possibly
too
much
of
the
reality
and
gravity
of
these
temptations
one
day
a
great
light
shone
for
not
riches
be
used
well
he
asked
theory
yes
replied
the
doctor
it
is
found
in
experience
that
no
one
does
so
all
the
world
imagine
they
will
be
exceptional
when
they
grow
wealthy
but
possession
is
debasing
new
desires
spring
up
and
the
silly
taste
for
ostentation
eats
out
the
heart
of
pleasure
you
might
be
better
if
you
had
less
said
the
boy
not
replied
the
doctor
but
his
voice
quavered
as
he
spoke
demanded
pitiless
innocence
doctor
desprez
saw
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
in
a
moment
the
stable
universe
appeared
to
be
about
capsizing
with
him
said
he
affecting
deliberation
after
an
obvious
pause
i
have
formed
my
life
for
my
present
income
it
is
not
good
for
men
of
my
years
to
be
violently
dissevered
from
their
habits
that
was
a
sharp
brush
the
doctor
breathed
hard
and
fell
into
taciturnity
for
the
afternoon
as
for
the
boy
he
was
delighted
with
the
resolution
of
his
doubts
even
wondered
that
he
had
not
foreseen
the
obvious
and
conclusive
answer
his
faith
in
the
doctor
was
a
stout
piece
of
goods
desprez
was
inclined
to
be
a
sheet
in
the
wind
eye
after
dinner
especially
after
rhone
wine
his
favourite
weakness
he
would
then
remark
on
the
warmth
of
his
feeling
for
anastasie
and
with
inflamed
cheeks
and
a
loose
flustered
smile
debate
upon
all
sorts
of
topics
and
be
feebly
and
indiscreetly
witty
but
the
adopted
would
not
permit
himself
to
entertain
a
doubt
that
savoured
of
ingratitude
it
is
quite
true
that
a
man
may
be
a
second
father
to
you
and
yet
take
too
much
to
drink
but
the
best
natures
are
ever
slow
to
accept
such
truths
the
doctor
thoroughly
possessed
his
heart
but
perhaps
he
exaggerated
his
influence
over
his
mind
certainly
adopted
some
of
his
master
opinions
but
i
have
yet
to
learn
that
he
ever
surrendered
one
of
his
own
convictions
existed
in
him
by
divine
right
they
were
virgin
unwrought
the
brute
metal
of
decision
he
could
add
others
indeed
but
he
could
not
put
away
neither
did
he
care
if
they
were
perfectly
agreed
among
themselves
and
his
spiritual
pleasures
had
nothing
to
do
with
turning
them
over
or
justifying
them
in
words
words
were
with
him
a
mere
accomplishment
like
dancing
when
he
was
by
himself
his
pleasures
were
almost
vegetable
he
would
slip
into
the
woods
towards
acheres
and
sit
in
the
mouth
of
a
cave
among
grey
birches
his
soul
stared
straight
out
of
his
eyes
he
did
not
move
or
think
sunlight
thin
shadows
moving
in
the
wind
the
edge
of
firs
against
the
sky
occupied
and
bound
his
faculties
he
was
pure
unity
a
spirit
wholly
abstracted
a
single
mood
filled
him
to
which
all
the
objects
of
sense
contributed
as
the
colours
of
the
spectrum
merge
and
disappear
in
white
light
so
while
the
doctor
made
himself
drunk
with
words
the
adopted
bemused
himself
with
silence
chapter
treasure
trove
the
doctor
carriage
was
a
gig
with
a
hood
a
kind
of
vehicle
in
much
favour
among
country
doctors
on
how
many
roads
has
one
not
seen
it
a
great
way
off
between
the
poplars
in
how
many
village
streets
tied
to
a
this
sort
of
chariot
is
affected
particularly
at
the
trot
by
a
kind
of
pitching
movement
to
and
fro
across
the
axle
which
well
entitles
it
to
the
style
of
a
noddy
the
hood
describes
a
considerable
arc
against
the
landscape
with
a
solemnly
absurd
effect
on
the
contemplative
pedestrian
to
ride
in
such
a
carriage
can
not
be
numbered
among
the
things
that
appertain
to
glory
but
i
have
no
doubt
it
may
be
useful
in
liver
complaint
thence
perhaps
its
wide
popularity
among
physicians
one
morning
early
led
forth
the
doctor
noddy
opened
the
gate
and
mounted
to
the
the
doctor
followed
arrayed
from
top
to
toe
in
spotless
linen
armed
with
an
immense
umbrella
and
girt
with
a
botanical
case
on
a
baldric
and
the
equipage
drove
off
smartly
in
a
breeze
of
its
own
provocation
they
were
bound
for
franchard
to
collect
plants
with
an
eye
to
the
pharmacopoeia
a
little
rattling
on
the
open
roads
and
they
came
to
the
borders
of
the
forest
and
struck
into
an
unfrequented
track
the
noddy
yawed
softly
over
the
sand
with
an
accompaniment
of
snapping
twigs
there
was
a
great
green
softly
murmuring
cloud
of
congregated
foliage
overhead
in
the
arcades
of
the
forest
the
air
retained
the
freshness
of
the
night
the
athletic
bearing
of
the
trees
each
carrying
its
leafy
mountain
pleased
the
mind
like
so
many
statues
and
the
lines
of
the
trunk
led
the
eye
admiringly
upward
to
where
the
extreme
leaves
sparkled
in
a
patch
of
azure
squirrels
leaped
in
mid
air
it
was
a
proper
spot
for
a
devotee
of
the
goddess
hygieia
you
been
to
franchard
inquired
the
doctor
fancy
not
replied
the
boy
is

a
gorge
continued
desprez
adopting
his
expository
voice
ruin
of
a
hermitage
and
chapel
history
tells
us
much
of
franchard
how
the
recluse
was
often
slain
by
robbers
how
he
lived
on
a
most
insufficient
diet
how
he
was
expected
to
pass
his
days
in
prayer
a
letter
is
preserved
addressed
to
one
of
these
solitaries
by
the
superior
of
his
order
full
of
admirable
hygienic
advice
bidding
him
go
from
his
book
to
praying
and
so
back
again
for
variety
sake
and
when
he
was
weary
of
both
to
stroll
about
his
garden
and
observe
the
honey
bees
it
is
to
this
day
my
own
system
you
must
often
have
remarked
me
leaving
the
pharmacopoeia
often
even
in
the
middle
of
a
phrase
to
come
forth
into
the
sun
and
air
i
admire
the
writer
of
that
letter
from
my
heart
he
was
a
man
of
thought
on
the
most
important
subjects
but
indeed
had
i
lived
in
the
middle
ages
i
am
heartily
glad
that
i
did
not
i
should
have
been
an
eremite
myself
if
i
had
not
been
a
professed
buffoon
that
is
these
were
the
only
philosophical
lives
yet
open
laughter
or
prayer
sneers
we
might
say
and
tears
until
the
sun
of
the
positive
arose
the
wise
man
had
to
make
his
choice
between
these
two
have
been
a
buffoon
of
course
observed
can
not
imagine
you
to
have
excelled
in
your
profession
said
the
doctor
admiring
the
boy
gravity
you
ever
laugh
yes
replied
the
other
laugh
often
i
am
very
fond
of
jokes
being
said
desprez
i
divagate
i
perceive
in
a
thousand
ways
that
i
grow
old
franchard
was
at
length
destroyed
in
the
english
wars
the
same
that
levelled
gretz
but
here
is
the
point
the
hermits
for
there
were
already
more
than
one
had
foreseen
the
danger
and
carefully
concealed
the
sacrificial
vessels
these
vessels
were
of
monstrous
value
monstrous
value
priceless
we
may
say
exquisitely
worked
of
exquisite
material
and
now
mark
me
they
have
never
been
found
in
the
reign
of
louis
quatorze
some
fellows
were
digging
hard
by
the
ruins
suddenly
tock
the
spade
hit
upon
an
obstacle
imagine
the
men
fooling
one
to
another
imagine
how
their
hearts
bounded
how
their
colour
came
and
went
it
was
a
coffer
and
in
franchard
the
place
of
buried
treasure
they
tore
it
open
like
famished
beasts
alas
it
was
not
the
treasure
only
some
priestly
robes
which
at
the
touch
of
the
eating
air
fell
upon
themselves
and
instantly
wasted
into
dust
the
perspiration
of
these
good
fellows
turned
cold
upon
them
i
will
pledge
my
reputation
if
there
was
anything
like
a
cutting
wind
one
or
other
had
a
pneumonia
for
his
trouble
should
like
to
have
seen
them
turning
into
dust
said
i
should
not
have
cared
so
greatly
have
no
imagination
cried
the
doctor
to
yourself
the
scene
dwell
on
the
idea
a
great
treasure
lying
in
the
earth
for
centuries
the
material
for
a
giddy
copious
opulent
existence
not
employed
dresses
and
exquisite
pictures
unseen
the
swiftest
galloping
horses
not
stirring
a
hoof
arrested
by
a
spell
women
with
the
beautiful
faculty
of
smiles
not
smiling
cards
dice
opera
singing
orchestras
castles
beautiful
parks
and
gardens
big
ships
with
a
tower
of
sailcloth
all
lying
unborn
in
a
coffin
and
the
stupid
trees
growing
overhead
in
the
sunlight
year
after
year
the
thought
drives
one
frantic
is
only
money
replied
would
do
harm
come
cried
desprez
is
philosophy
it
is
all
very
fine
but
not
to
the
point
just
now
and
besides
it
is
not
only
money
as
you
call
it
there
are
works
of
art
in
the
question
the
vessels
were
carved
you
speak
like
a
child
you
weary
me
exceedingly
quoting
my
words
out
of
all
logical
connection
like
a
parroquet
at
any
rate
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
returned
the
boy
submissively
they
struck
the
route
ronde
at
that
moment
and
the
sudden
change
to
the
rattling
causeway
combined
with
the
doctor
irritation
to
keep
him
silent
the
noddy
jigged
along
the
trees
went
by
looking
on
silently
as
if
they
had
something
on
their
minds
the
quadrilateral
was
passed
then
came
franchard
they
put
up
the
horse
at
the
little
solitary
inn
and
went
forth
strolling
the
gorge
was
dyed
deeply
with
heather
the
rocks
and
birches
standing
luminous
in
the
sun
a
great
humming
of
bees
about
the
flowers
disposed
to
sleep
and
he
sat
down
against
a
clump
of
heather
while
the
doctor
went
briskly
to
and
fro
with
quick
turns
culling
his
simples
the
boy
head
had
fallen
a
little
forward
his
eyes
were
closed
his
fingers
had
fallen
lax
about
his
knees
when
a
sudden
cry
called
him
to
his
feet
it
was
a
strange
sound
thin
and
brief
it
fell
dead
and
silence
returned
as
though
it
had
never
been
interrupted
he
had
not
recognised
the
doctor
voice
but
as
there
was
no
one
else
in
all
the
valley
it
was
plainly
the
doctor
who
had
given
utterance
to
the
sound
he
looked
right
and
left
and
there
was
desprez
standing
in
a
niche
between
two
boulders
and
looking
round
on
his
adopted
son
with
a
countenance
as
white
as
paper
viper
cried
running
towards
him
viper
you
are
bitten
the
doctor
came
down
heavily
out
of
the
cleft
and
advanced
in
silence
to
meet
the
boy
whom
he
took
roughly
by
the
shoulder
have
found
it
he
said
with
a
gasp
plant
asked
desprez
had
a
fit
of
unnatural
gaiety
which
the
rocks
took
up
and
mimicked
plant
he
repeated
scornfully
yes
a
plant
and
here
he
added
suddenly
showing
his
right
hand
which
he
had
hitherto
concealed
behind
his
back
is
one
of
the
bulbs
saw
a
dirty
platter
coated
with
earth
said
he
is
a
plate
is
a
coach
and
horses
cried
the
doctor
he
continued
growing
warmer
plucked
away
a
great
pad
of
moss
from
between
these
boulders
and
disclosed
a
crevice
and
when
i
looked
in
what
do
you
suppose
i
saw
i
saw
a
house
in
paris
with
a
court
and
garden
i
saw
my
wife
shining
with
diamonds
i
saw
myself
a
deputy
i
saw
you
well
i
i
saw
your
future
he
concluded
rather
feebly
have
just
discovered
america
he
added
what
is
it
asked
the
boy
treasure
of
franchard
cried
the
doctor
and
throwing
his
brown
straw
hat
upon
the
ground
he
whooped
like
an
indian
and
sprang
upon
marie
whom
he
suffocated
with
embraces
and
bedewed
with
tears
then
he
flung
himself
down
among
the
heather
and
once
more
laughed
until
the
valley
rang
but
the
boy
had
now
an
interest
of
his
own
a
boy
interest
no
sooner
was
he
released
from
the
doctor
accolade
than
he
ran
to
the
boulders
sprang
into
the
niche
and
thrusting
his
hand
into
the
crevice
drew
forth
one
after
another
encrusted
with
the
earth
of
ages
the
flagons
candlesticks
and
patens
of
the
hermitage
of
franchard
a
casket
came
last
tightly
shut
and
very
heavy
what
fun
he
cried
but
when
he
looked
back
at
the
doctor
who
had
followed
close
behind
and
was
silently
observing
the
words
died
from
his
lips
desprez
was
once
more
the
colour
of
ashes
his
lip
worked
and
trembled
a
sort
of
bestial
greed
possessed
him
is
childish
he
said
lose
precious
time
back
to
the
inn
harness
the
trap
and
bring
it
to
yon
bank
run
for
your
life
and
remember
not
one
whisper
i
stay
here
to
watch
did
as
he
was
bid
though
not
without
surprise
the
noddy
was
brought
round
to
the
spot
indicated
and
the
two
gradually
transported
the
treasure
from
its
place
of
concealment
to
the
boot
below
the
driving
seat
once
it
was
all
stored
the
doctor
recovered
his
gaiety
pay
my
grateful
duties
to
the
genius
of
this
dell
he
said
for
a
live
coal
a
heifer
and
a
jar
of
country
wine
i
am
in
the
vein
for
sacrifice
for
a
superb
libation
well
and
why
not
we
are
at
franchard
english
pale
ale
is
to
be
had
not
classical
indeed
but
excellent
boy
we
shall
drink
ale
i
thought
it
was
so
unwholesome
said
very
dear
besides
exclaimed
the
doctor
gaily
the
inn
and
he
stepped
into
the
noddy
tossing
his
head
with
an
elastic
youthful
air
the
horse
was
turned
and
in
a
few
seconds
they
drew
up
beside
the
palings
of
the
inn
garden
said
desprez
near
the
table
so
that
we
may
keep
an
eye
upon
things
they
tied
the
horse
and
entered
the
garden
the
doctor
singing
now
in
fantastic
high
notes
now
producing
deep
reverberations
from
his
chest
he
took
a
seat
rapped
loudly
on
the
table
assailed
the
waiter
with
witticisms
and
when
the
bottle
of
bass
was
at
length
produced
far
more
charged
with
gas
than
the
most
delirious
champagne
he
filled
out
a
long
glassful
of
froth
and
pushed
it
over
to
he
said
deep
would
rather
not
faltered
the
boy
true
to
his
training
thundered
desprez
am
afraid
of
it
said
stomach
it
or
leave
it
interrupted
desprez
fiercely
understand
it
once
for
all
there
is
nothing
so
contemptible
as
a
precisian
here
was
a
new
lesson
the
boy
sat
bemused
looking
at
the
glass
but
not
tasting
it
while
the
doctor
emptied
and
refilled
his
own
at
first
with
clouded
brow
but
gradually
yielding
to
the
sun
the
heady
prickling
beverage
and
his
own
predisposition
to
be
happy
in
a
way
he
said
at
last
by
way
of
a
concession
to
the
more
rigorous
attitude
in
a
way
and
at
so
critical
a
moment
this
ale
is
a
nectar
for
the
gods
the
habit
indeed
is
debasing
wine
the
juice
of
the
grape
is
the
true
drink
of
the
frenchman
as
i
have
often
had
occasion
to
point
out
and
i
do
not
know
that
i
can
blame
you
for
refusing
this
outlandish
stimulant
you
can
have
some
wine
and
cakes
is
the
bottle
empty
well
we
will
not
be
proud
we
will
have
pity
on
your
glass
the
beer
being
done
the
doctor
chafed
bitterly
while
finished
his
cakes
burn
to
be
gone
he
said
looking
at
his
watch
god
how
slow
you
eat
and
yet
to
eat
slowly
was
his
own
particular
prescription
the
main
secret
of
longevity
his
martyrdom
however
reached
an
end
at
last
the
pair
resumed
their
places
in
the
buggy
and
desprez
leaning
luxuriously
back
announced
his
intention
of
proceeding
to
fontainebleau
fontainebleau
repeated
words
are
always
measured
said
the
doctor
the
doctor
was
driven
through
the
glades
of
paradise
the
air
the
light
the
shining
leaves
the
very
movements
of
the
vehicle
seemed
to
fall
in
tune
with
his
golden
meditations
with
his
head
thrown
back
he
dreamed
a
series
of
sunny
visions
ale
and
pleasure
dancing
in
his
veins
at
last
he
spoke
shall
telegraph
for
casimir
he
said
casimir
a
fellow
of
the
lower
order
of
intelligence
distinctly
not
creative
not
poetic
and
yet
he
will
repay
your
study
his
fortune
is
vast
and
is
entirely
due
to
his
own
exertions
he
is
the
very
fellow
to
help
us
to
dispose
of
our
trinkets
find
us
a
suitable
house
in
paris
and
manage
the
details
of
our
installation
admirable
casimir
one
of
my
oldest
comrades
it
was
on
his
advice
i
may
add
that
i
invested
my
little
fortune
in
turkish
bonds
when
we
have
added
these
spoils
of
the
mediaeval
church
to
our
stake
in
the
mahometan
empire
little
boy
we
shall
positively
roll
among
doubloons
positively
roll
beautiful
forest
he
cried
though
called
to
other
scenes
i
will
not
forget
thee
thy
name
is
graven
in
my
heart
under
the
influence
of
prosperity
i
become
dithyrambic
such
is
the
impulse
of
the
natural
soul
such
was
the
constitution
of
primaeval
man
and
i
well
i
will
not
refuse
the
credit
i
have
preserved
my
youth
like
a
virginity
another
who
should
have
led
the
same
snoozing
countryfied
existence
for
these
years
another
had
become
rusted
become
stereotype
but
i
i
praise
my
happy
constitution
retain
the
spring
unbroken
fresh
opulence
and
a
new
sphere
of
duties
find
me
unabated
in
ardour
and
only
more
mature
by
knowledge
for
this
prospective
change
it
may
probably
have
shocked
you
tell
me
now
did
it
not
strike
you
as
an
inconsistency
confess
it
is
useless
to
dissemble
it
pained
you
said
the
boy
see
returned
the
doctor
with
sublime
fatuity
read
your
thoughts
nor
am
i
surprised
your
education
is
not
yet
complete
the
higher
duties
of
men
have
not
been
yet
presented
to
you
fully
a
hint
till
we
have
leisure
must
suffice
now
that
i
am
once
more
in
possession
of
a
modest
competence
now
that
i
have
so
long
prepared
myself
in
silent
meditation
it
becomes
my
superior
duty
to
proceed
to
paris
my
scientific
training
my
undoubted
command
of
language
mark
me
out
for
the
service
of
my
country
modesty
in
such
a
case
would
be
a
snare
if
sin
were
a
philosophical
expression
i
should
call
it
sinful
a
man
must
not
deny
his
manifest
abilities
for
that
is
to
evade
his
obligations
i
must
be
up
and
doing
i
must
be
no
skulker
in
battle
so
he
rattled
on
copiously
greasing
the
joint
of
his
inconsistency
with
words
while
the
boy
listened
silently
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
horse
his
mind
seething
it
was
all
lost
eloquence
no
array
of
words
could
unsettle
a
belief
of
and
he
drove
into
fontainebleau
filled
with
pity
horror
indignation
and
despair
in
the
town
was
kept
a
fixture
on
the
to
guard
the
treasure
while
the
doctor
with
a
singular
slightly
tipsy
airiness
of
manner
fluttered
in
and
out
of
cafes
where
he
shook
hands
with
garrison
officers
and
mixed
an
absinthe
with
the
nicety
of
old
experience
in
and
out
of
shops
from
which
he
returned
laden
with
costly
fruits
real
turtle
a
magnificent
piece
of
silk
for
his
wife
a
preposterous
cane
for
himself
and
a
kepi
of
the
newest
fashion
for
the
boy
in
and
out
of
the
telegraph
office
whence
he
despatched
his
telegram
and
where
three
hours
later
he
received
an
answer
promising
a
visit
on
the
morrow
and
generally
pervaded
fontainebleau
with
the
first
fine
aroma
of
his
divine
good
humour
the
sun
was
very
low
when
they
set
forth
again
the
shadows
of
the
forest
trees
extended
across
the
broad
white
road
that
led
them
home
the
penetrating
odour
of
the
evening
wood
had
already
arisen
like
a
cloud
of
incense
from
that
broad
field
of
and
even
in
the
streets
of
the
town
where
the
air
had
been
baked
all
day
between
white
walls
it
came
in
whiffs
and
pulses
like
a
distant
music
home
the
last
gold
flicker
vanished
from
a
great
oak
upon
the
left
and
when
they
came
forth
beyond
the
borders
of
the
wood
the
plain
was
already
sunken
in
pearly
greyness
and
a
great
pale
moon
came
swinging
skyward
through
the
filmy
poplars
the
doctor
sang
the
doctor
whistled
the
doctor
talked
he
spoke
of
the
woods
and
the
wars
and
the
deposition
of
dew
he
brightened
and
babbled
of
paris
he
soared
into
cloudy
bombast
on
the
glories
of
the
political
arena
all
was
to
be
changed
as
the
day
departed
it
took
with
it
the
vestiges
of
an
outworn
existence
and
sun
was
to
inaugurate
the
new
he
cried
this
life
of
maceration
his
wife
still
beautiful
or
he
was
sadly
partial
was
to
be
no
longer
buried
she
should
now
shine
before
society
would
find
the
world
at
his
feet
the
roads
open
to
success
wealth
honour
and
renown
o
by
the
way
said
he
god
sake
keep
your
tongue
quiet
you
are
of
course
a
very
silent
fellow
it
is
a
quality
i
gladly
recognise
in
you
silence
golden
silence
but
this
is
a
matter
of
gravity
no
word
must
get
abroad
none
but
the
good
casimir
is
to
be
trusted
we
shall
probably
dispose
of
the
vessels
in
england
are
they
not
even
ours
the
boy
said
almost
with
a
sob
it
was
the
only
time
he
had
spoken
in
this
sense
that
they
are
nobody
else
replied
the
doctor
the
state
would
have
some
claim
if
they
were
stolen
for
instance
we
should
be
unable
to
demand
their
restitution
we
should
have
no
title
we
should
be
unable
even
to
communicate
with
the
police
such
is
the
monstrous
condition
of
the
law
it
is
a
mere
instance
of
what
remains
to
be
done
of
the
injustices
that
may
yet
be
righted
by
an
ardent
active
and
philosophical
deputy
put
his
faith
in
madame
desprez
and
as
they
drove
forward
down
the
road
from
bourron
between
the
rustling
poplars
he
prayed
in
his
teeth
and
whipped
up
the
horse
to
an
unusual
speed
surely
as
soon
as
they
arrived
madame
would
assert
her
character
and
bring
this
waking
nightmare
to
an
end
their
entrance
into
gretz
was
heralded
and
accompanied
by
a
most
furious
barking
all
the
dogs
in
the
village
seemed
to
smell
the
treasure
in
the
noddy
but
there
was
no
one
in
the
street
save
three
lounging
landscape
painters
at
tentaillon
door
opened
the
green
gate
and
led
in
the
horse
and
carriage
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
madame
desprez
came
to
the
kitchen
threshold
with
a
lighted
lantern
for
the
moon
was
not
yet
high
enough
to
clear
the
garden
walls
the
gates
cried
the
doctor
somewhat
unsteadily
alighting
where
is
aline
has
gone
to
montereau
to
see
her
parents
said
madame
is
for
the
best
exclaimed
the
doctor
fervently
quick
come
near
to
me
i
do
not
wish
to
speak
too
loud
he
continued
we
are
wealthy
repeated
the
wife
have
found
the
treasure
of
franchard
replied
her
husband
here
are
the
first
fruits
a
pineapple
a
dress
for
my
it
will
suit
her
trust
a
husband
trust
a
lover
taste
embrace
me
darling
this
grimy
episode
is
over
the
butterfly
unfolds
its
painted
wings
casimir
will
come
in
a
week
we
may
be
in
paris
happy
at
last
you
shall
have
diamonds
take
it
out
of
the
boot
with
religious
care
and
bring
it
piece
by
piece
into
the
we
shall
have
plate
at
table
darling
hasten
and
prepare
this
turtle
it
will
be
a
whet
it
will
be
an
addition
to
our
meagre
ordinary
i
myself
will
proceed
to
the
cellar
we
shall
have
a
bottle
of
that
little
beaujolais
you
like
and
finish
with
the
hermitage
there
are
still
three
bottles
left
worthy
wine
for
a
worthy
occasion
my
husband
you
put
me
in
a
whirl
she
cried
do
not
comprehend
turtle
my
adored
the
turtle
cried
the
doctor
and
he
pushed
her
towards
the
kitchen
lantern
and
all
stood
dumfounded
he
had
pictured
to
himself
a
different
scene
a
more
immediate
protest
and
his
hope
began
to
dwindle
on
the
spot
the
doctor
was
everywhere
a
little
doubtful
on
his
legs
perhaps
and
now
and
then
taking
the
wall
with
his
shoulder
for
it
was
long
since
he
had
tasted
absinthe
and
he
was
even
then
reflecting
that
the
absinthe
had
been
a
misconception
not
that
he
regretted
excess
on
such
a
glorious
day
but
he
made
a
mental
memorandum
to
beware
he
must
not
a
second
time
become
the
victim
of
a
deleterious
habit
he
had
his
wine
out
of
the
cellar
in
a
twinkling
he
arranged
the
sacrificial
vessels
some
on
the
white
some
on
the
sideboard
still
crusted
with
historic
earth
he
was
in
and
out
of
the
kitchen
plying
anastasie
with
vermouth
heating
her
with
glimpses
of
the
future
estimating
their
new
wealth
at
ever
larger
figures
and
before
they
sat
down
to
supper
the
lady
virtue
had
melted
in
the
fire
of
his
enthusiasm
her
timidity
had
disappeared
she
too
had
begun
to
speak
disparagingly
of
the
life
at
gretz
and
as
she
took
her
place
and
helped
the
soup
her
eyes
shone
with
the
glitter
of
prospective
diamonds
all
through
the
meal
she
and
the
doctor
made
and
unmade
fairy
plans
they
bobbed
and
bowed
and
pledged
each
other
their
faces
ran
over
with
smiles
their
eyes
scattered
sparkles
as
they
projected
the
political
honours
and
the
lady
ovations
you
will
not
be
a
red
cried
anastasie
am
left
centre
to
the
core
replied
the
doctor
gastein
will
present
us
we
shall
find
ourselves
forgotten
said
the
lady
protested
the
doctor
and
talent
leave
a
mark
have
positively
forgotten
how
to
dress
she
sighed
you
make
me
blush
cried
he
has
been
a
tragic
marriage
your
success
to
see
you
appreciated
honoured
your
name
in
all
the
papers
that
will
be
more
than
pleasure
it
will
be
heaven
she
cried
once
a
week
said
the
doctor
archly
scanning
the
syllables
a
week
one
good
little
game
of
baccarat
once
a
week
she
questioned
threatening
him
with
a
finger
swear
it
by
my
political
honour
cried
he
spoil
you
she
said
and
gave
him
her
hand
he
covered
it
with
kisses
escaped
into
the
night
the
moon
swung
high
over
gretz
he
went
down
to
the
garden
end
and
sat
on
the
jetty
the
river
ran
by
with
eddies
of
oily
silver
and
a
low
monotonous
song
faint
veils
of
mist
moved
among
the
poplars
on
the
farther
side
the
reeds
were
quietly
nodding
a
hundred
times
already
had
the
boy
sat
on
such
a
night
and
watched
the
streaming
river
with
untroubled
fancy
and
this
perhaps
was
to
be
the
last
he
was
to
leave
this
familiar
hamlet
this
green
rustling
country
this
bright
and
quiet
stream
he
was
to
pass
into
the
great
city
his
dear
lady
mistress
was
to
move
bedizened
in
saloons
his
good
garrulous
master
to
become
a
brawling
deputy
and
both
be
lost
for
ever
to
and
their
better
selves
he
knew
his
own
defects
he
knew
he
must
sink
into
less
and
less
consideration
in
the
turmoil
of
a
city
life
sink
more
and
more
from
the
child
into
the
servant
and
he
began
dimly
to
believe
the
doctor
prophecies
of
evil
he
could
see
a
change
in
both
his
generous
incredulity
failed
him
for
this
once
a
child
must
have
perceived
that
the
hermitage
had
completed
what
the
absinthe
had
begun
if
this
were
the
first
day
what
would
be
the
last
necessary
wreck
the
train
thought
he
remembering
the
doctor
parable
he
looked
round
on
the
delightful
scene
he
drank
deep
of
the
charmed
night
air
laden
with
the
scent
of
hay
necessary
wreck
the
train
he
repeated
and
he
rose
and
returned
to
the
house
chapter
vi
a
criminal
investigation
in
two
parts
the
next
morning
there
was
a
most
unusual
outcry
in
the
doctor
house
the
last
thing
before
going
to
bed
the
doctor
had
locked
up
some
valuables
in
the
cupboard
and
behold
when
he
rose
again
as
he
did
about
four
the
cupboard
had
been
broken
open
and
the
valuables
in
question
had
disappeared
madame
and
were
summoned
from
their
rooms
and
appeared
in
hasty
toilets
they
found
the
doctor
raving
calling
the
heavens
to
witness
and
avenge
his
injury
pacing
the
room
with
the
tails
of
his
flirting
as
he
turned
he
said
things
are
gone
the
fortune
gone
we
are
paupers
once
more
boy
what
do
you
know
of
this
speak
up
sir
speak
up
do
you
know
of
it
where
are
they
he
had
him
by
the
arm
shaking
him
like
a
bag
and
the
boy
words
if
he
had
any
were
jolted
forth
in
inarticulate
murmurs
the
doctor
with
a
revulsion
from
his
own
violence
set
him
down
again
he
observed
anastasie
in
tears
he
said
in
quite
an
altered
voice
yourself
command
your
feelings
i
would
not
have
you
give
way
to
passion
like
the
vulgar
this
this
trifling
accident
must
be
lived
down
bring
me
my
smaller
medicine
chest
a
gentle
laxative
is
indicated
and
he
dosed
the
family
all
round
leading
the
way
himself
with
a
double
quantity
the
wretched
anastasie
who
had
never
been
ill
in
the
whole
course
of
her
existence
and
whose
soul
recoiled
from
remedies
wept
floods
of
tears
as
she
sipped
and
shuddered
and
protested
and
then
was
bullied
and
shouted
at
until
she
sipped
again
as
for
he
took
his
portion
down
with
stoicism
have
given
him
a
less
amount
observed
the
doctor
youth
protecting
him
against
emotion
and
now
that
we
have
thus
parried
any
morbid
consequences
let
us
reason
am
so
cold
wailed
anastasie
cried
the
doctor
give
thanks
to
god
that
i
am
made
of
fierier
material
why
madam
a
blow
like
this
would
set
a
frog
into
a
transpiration
if
you
are
cold
you
can
retire
and
by
the
way
you
might
throw
me
down
my
trousers
it
is
chilly
for
the
legs
no
protested
anastasie
will
stay
with
you
madam
you
shall
not
suffer
for
your
devotion
said
the
doctor
will
myself
fetch
you
a
shawl
and
he
went
upstairs
and
returned
more
fully
clad
and
with
an
armful
of
wraps
for
the
shivering
anastasie
now
he
resumed
investigate
this
crime
let
us
proceed
by
induction
anastasie
do
you
know
anything
that
can
help
us
anastasie
knew
nothing
you
i
replied
the
boy
steadily
returned
the
doctor
shall
now
turn
our
attention
to
the
material
evidences
i
was
born
to
be
a
detective
i
have
the
eye
and
the
systematic
spirit
first
violence
has
been
employed
the
door
was
broken
open
and
it
may
be
observed
in
passing
that
the
lock
was
dear
indeed
at
what
i
paid
for
it
a
crow
to
pluck
with
master
goguelat
second
here
is
the
instrument
employed
one
of
our
own
one
of
our
best
my
dear
which
seems
to
indicate
no
preparation
on
the
part
of
the
gang
if
gang
it
was
thirdly
i
observe
that
nothing
has
been
removed
except
the
franchard
dishes
and
the
casket
our
own
silver
has
been
minutely
respected
this
is
wily
it
shows
intelligence
a
knowledge
of
the
code
a
desire
to
avoid
legal
consequences
i
argue
from
this
fact
that
the
gang
numbers
persons
of
respectability
outward
of
course
and
merely
outward
as
the
robbery
proves
but
i
argue
second
that
we
must
have
been
observed
at
franchard
itself
by
some
occult
observer
and
dogged
throughout
the
day
with
a
skill
and
patience
that
i
venture
to
qualify
as
consummate
no
ordinary
man
no
occasional
criminal
would
have
shown
himself
capable
of
this
combination
we
have
in
our
neighbourhood
it
is
far
from
improbable
a
retired
bandit
of
the
highest
order
of
intelligence
heaven
cried
the
horrified
anastasie
how
can
you
cherished
one
this
is
a
process
of
induction
said
the
doctor
any
of
my
steps
are
unsound
correct
me
you
are
silent
then
do
not
i
beseech
you
be
so
vulgarly
illogical
as
to
revolt
from
my
conclusion
we
have
now
arrived
he
resumed
some
idea
of
the
composition
of
the
gang
for
i
incline
to
the
hypothesis
of
more
than
one
and
we
now
leave
this
room
which
can
disclose
no
more
and
turn
our
attention
to
the
court
and
garden
i
trust
you
are
observantly
following
my
various
steps
this
is
an
excellent
piece
of
education
for
you
come
with
me
to
the
door
no
steps
on
the
court
it
is
unfortunate
our
court
should
be
paved
on
what
small
matters
hang
the
destiny
of
these
delicate
investigations
hey
what
have
we
here
i
have
led
on
to
the
very
spot
he
said
standing
grandly
backward
and
indicating
the
green
gate
escalade
as
you
can
now
see
for
yourselves
has
taken
place
sure
enough
the
green
paint
was
in
several
places
scratched
and
broken
and
one
of
the
panels
preserved
the
print
of
a
nailed
shoe
the
foot
had
slipped
however
and
it
was
difficult
to
estimate
the
size
of
the
shoe
and
impossible
to
distinguish
the
pattern
of
the
nails
whole
robbery
concluded
the
doctor
by
step
has
been
reconstituted
inductive
science
can
no
further
go
is
wonderful
said
his
wife
should
indeed
have
been
a
detective
henri
i
had
no
idea
of
your
talents
dear
replied
desprez
condescendingly
man
of
scientific
imagination
combines
the
lesser
faculties
he
is
a
detective
just
as
he
is
a
publicist
or
a
general
these
are
but
local
applications
of
his
special
talent
but
now
he
continued
you
have
me
go
further
would
you
have
me
lay
my
finger
on
the
culprits
or
rather
for
i
can
not
promise
quite
so
much
point
out
to
you
the
very
house
where
they
consort
it
may
be
a
satisfaction
at
least
it
is
all
we
are
likely
to
get
since
we
are
denied
the
remedy
of
law
i
reach
the
further
stage
in
this
way
in
order
to
fill
my
outline
of
the
robbery
i
require
a
man
likely
to
be
in
the
forest
idling
i
require
a
man
of
education
i
require
a
man
superior
to
considerations
of
morality
the
three
requisites
all
centre
in
tentaillon
boarders
they
are
painters
therefore
they
are
continually
lounging
in
the
forest
they
are
painters
therefore
they
are
not
unlikely
to
have
some
smattering
of
education
lastly
because
they
are
painters
they
are
probably
immoral
and
this
i
prove
in
two
ways
first
painting
is
an
art
which
merely
addresses
the
eye
it
does
not
in
any
particular
exercise
the
moral
sense
and
second
painting
in
common
with
all
the
other
arts
implies
the
dangerous
quality
of
imagination
a
man
of
imagination
is
never
moral
he
outsoars
literal
demarcations
and
reviews
life
under
too
many
shifting
lights
to
rest
content
with
the
invidious
distinctions
of
the
law
you
always
say
at
least
so
i
understood
you
said
madame
these
lads
display
no
imagination
whatever
dear
they
displayed
imagination
and
of
a
very
fantastic
order
too
returned
the
doctor
they
embraced
their
beggarly
profession
besides
and
this
is
an
argument
exactly
suited
to
your
intellectual
level
many
of
them
are
english
and
american
where
else
should
we
expect
to
find
a
thief
and
now
you
had
better
get
your
coffee
because
we
have
lost
a
treasure
there
is
no
reason
for
starving
for
my
part
i
shall
break
my
fast
with
white
wine
i
feel
unaccountably
heated
and
thirsty
i
can
only
attribute
it
to
the
shock
of
the
discovery
and
yet
you
will
bear
me
out
i
supported
the
emotion
nobly
the
doctor
had
now
talked
himself
back
into
an
admirable
humour
and
as
he
sat
in
the
arbour
and
slowly
imbibed
a
large
allowance
of
white
wine
and
picked
a
little
bread
and
cheese
with
no
very
impetuous
appetite
if
a
third
of
his
meditations
ran
upon
the
missing
treasure
the
other
thirds
were
more
pleasingly
busied
in
the
retrospect
of
his
detective
skill
about
eleven
casimir
arrived
he
had
caught
an
early
train
to
fontainebleau
and
driven
over
to
save
time
and
now
his
cab
was
stabled
at
tentaillon
and
he
remarked
studying
his
watch
that
he
could
spare
an
hour
and
a
half
he
was
much
the
man
of
business
decisively
spoken
given
to
frowning
in
an
intellectual
manner
anastasie
born
brother
he
did
not
waste
much
sentiment
on
the
lady
gave
her
an
english
family
kiss
and
demanded
a
meal
without
delay
can
tell
me
your
story
while
we
eat
he
observed
good
stasie
he
was
promised
something
good
the
trio
sat
down
to
table
in
the
arbour
waiting
as
well
as
eating
and
the
doctor
recounted
what
had
happened
in
his
richest
narrative
manner
casimir
heard
it
with
explosions
of
laughter
a
streak
of
luck
for
you
my
good
brother
he
observed
when
the
tale
was
over
you
had
gone
to
paris
you
would
have
played
with
the
whole
consignment
in
three
months
your
own
would
have
followed
and
you
would
have
come
to
me
in
a
procession
like
the
last
time
but
i
give
you
warning
stasie
may
weep
and
henri
ratiocinate
it
will
not
serve
you
twice
your
next
collapse
will
be
fatal
i
thought
i
had
told
you
so
stasie
hey
no
sense
the
doctor
winced
and
looked
furtively
at
but
the
boy
seemed
apathetic
then
again
broke
out
casimir
children
you
are
vicious
children
my
faith
how
could
you
tell
the
value
of
this
trash
it
might
have
been
worth
nothing
or
next
door
me
said
the
doctor
have
your
usual
flow
of
spirits
i
perceive
but
even
less
than
your
usual
deliberation
i
am
not
entirely
ignorant
of
these
matters
entirely
ignorant
of
anything
ever
i
heard
of
interrupted
casimir
bowing
and
raising
his
glass
with
a
sort
of
pert
politeness
least
resumed
the
doctor
gave
my
mind
to
the
subject
that
you
may
be
willing
to
believe
and
i
estimated
that
our
capital
would
be
doubled
and
he
described
the
nature
of
the
find
word
of
honour
said
casimir
half
believe
you
but
much
would
depend
on
the
quality
of
the
gold
quality
my
dear
casimir
was
and
the
doctor
in
default
of
language
kissed
his
would
not
take
your
word
for
it
my
good
friend
retorted
the
man
of
business
are
a
man
of
very
rosy
views
but
this
robbery
he
continued
robbery
is
an
odd
thing
of
course
i
pass
over
your
nonsense
about
gangs
and
for
me
that
is
a
dream
who
was
in
the
house
last
night
but
ourselves
replied
the
doctor
this
young
gentleman
asked
casimir
jerking
a
nod
in
the
direction
of
too
the
doctor
bowed
and
if
it
is
a
fair
question
who
is
he
pursued
the
law
answered
the
doctor
the
functions
of
a
son
and
he
began
as
the
latter
but
he
rose
rapidly
to
the
more
honourable
rank
in
our
affections
he
is
i
may
say
the
greatest
comfort
in
our
lives
said
casimir
previous
to
becoming
one
of
you
has
lived
a
remarkable
existence
his
experience
his
been
eminently
formative
replied
desprez
i
had
had
to
choose
an
education
for
my
son
i
should
have
chosen
such
another
beginning
life
with
mountebanks
and
thieves
passing
onward
to
the
society
and
friendship
of
philosophers
he
may
be
said
to
have
skimmed
the
volume
of
human
life
repeated
the
with
a
meditative
air
the
doctor
could
have
bitten
his
tongue
out
he
foresaw
what
was
coming
and
prepared
his
mind
for
a
vigorous
defence
you
ever
steal
yourself
asked
casimir
turning
suddenly
on
marie
and
for
the
first
time
employing
a
single
eyeglass
which
hung
round
his
neck
sir
replied
the
boy
with
a
deep
blush
casimir
turned
to
the
others
with
pursed
lips
and
nodded
to
them
meaningly
said
he
is
that
is
a
teller
of
the
truth
returned
the
doctor
throwing
out
his
bust
has
never
told
a
lie
added
madame
is
the
best
of
boys
told
a
lie
has
he
not
reflected
casimir
very
strange
give
me
your
attention
my
young
friend
he
continued
knew
about
this
treasure
helped
to
bring
it
home
interposed
the
doctor
i
ask
you
nothing
but
to
hold
your
tongue
returned
casimir
mean
to
question
this
of
yours
and
if
you
are
so
certain
of
his
innocence
you
can
afford
to
let
him
answer
for
himself
now
sir
he
resumed
pointing
his
eyeglass
straight
at
knew
it
could
be
stolen
with
impunity
you
knew
you
could
not
be
prosecuted
come
did
you
or
did
you
not
did
answered
in
a
miserable
whisper
he
sat
there
changing
colour
like
a
revolving
pharos
twisting
his
fingers
hysterically
swallowing
air
the
picture
of
guilt
knew
where
it
was
put
resumed
the
inquisitor
from
say
you
have
been
a
thief
before
continued
casimir
how
am
i
to
know
that
you
are
not
one
still
i
suppose
you
could
climb
the
green
gate
still
lower
from
the
culprit
then
it
was
you
who
stole
these
things
you
know
it
and
you
dare
not
deny
it
look
me
in
the
face
raise
your
sneak
eyes
and
answer
but
in
place
of
anything
of
that
sort
broke
into
a
dismal
howl
and
fled
from
the
arbour
anastasie
as
she
pursued
to
capture
and
reassure
the
victim
found
time
to
send
one
parthian
arrow
you
are
a
brute
brother
said
desprez
with
the
greatest
dignity
take
upon
yourself
a
licence
interrupted
casimir
heaven
sake
be
a
man
of
the
world
you
telegraph
me
to
leave
my
business
and
come
down
here
on
yours
i
come
i
ask
the
business
you
say
find
me
this
thief
well
i
find
him
i
say
there
he
is
you
need
not
like
it
but
you
have
no
manner
of
right
to
take
offence
returned
the
doctor
grant
that
i
will
even
thank
you
for
your
mistaken
zeal
but
your
hypothesis
was
so
extravagantly
monstrous
here
interrupted
casimir
it
you
or
stasie
not
answered
the
doctor
well
then
it
was
the
boy
say
no
more
about
it
said
the
and
he
produced
his
will
say
this
much
more
returned
desprez
that
boy
came
and
told
me
so
himself
i
should
not
believe
him
and
if
i
did
believe
him
so
implicit
is
my
trust
i
should
conclude
that
he
had
acted
for
the
best
well
said
casimir
indulgently
you
a
light
i
must
be
going
and
by
the
way
i
wish
you
would
let
me
sell
your
turks
for
you
i
always
told
you
it
meant
smash
i
tell
you
so
again
indeed
it
was
partly
that
that
brought
me
down
you
never
acknowledge
my
letters
a
most
unpardonable
habit
good
brother
replied
the
doctor
blandly
have
never
denied
your
ability
in
business
but
i
can
perceive
your
limitations
my
friend
i
can
return
the
compliment
observed
the
man
of
business
limitation
is
to
be
downright
irrational
the
relative
position
returned
the
doctor
with
a
smile
is
your
attitude
to
believe
through
thick
and
thin
in
one
judgment
your
own
i
follow
the
same
opinion
but
critically
and
with
open
eyes
which
is
the
more
irrational
i
leave
it
to
yourself
my
dear
fellow
cried
casimir
to
your
turks
stick
to
your
go
to
the
devil
in
general
in
your
own
way
and
be
done
with
it
but
do
ratiocinate
with
me
i
can
not
bear
it
and
so
i
might
as
well
have
stayed
away
for
any
good
i
done
say
from
me
to
stasie
and
to
the
sullen
of
a
if
you
insist
on
it
i
off
and
casimir
departed
the
doctor
that
night
dissected
his
character
before
anastasie
thing
my
beautiful
he
said
has
learned
one
thing
from
his
lifelong
acquaintance
with
your
husband
the
word
it
shines
in
his
vocabulary
like
a
jewel
in
a
and
even
so
he
continually
misapplies
it
for
you
must
have
observed
he
uses
it
as
a
sort
of
taunt
in
the
sense
of
to
implying
as
it
were
the
poor
dear
fellow
a
vein
of
sophistry
as
for
his
cruelty
to
it
must
be
forgiven
him
it
is
not
his
nature
it
is
the
nature
of
his
life
a
man
who
deals
with
money
my
dear
is
a
man
lost
with
the
process
of
reconciliation
had
been
somewhat
slow
at
first
he
was
inconsolable
insisted
on
leaving
the
family
went
from
paroxysm
to
paroxysm
of
tears
and
it
was
only
after
anastasie
had
been
closeted
for
an
hour
with
him
alone
that
she
came
forth
sought
out
the
doctor
and
with
tears
in
her
eyes
acquainted
that
gentleman
with
what
had
passed
first
my
husband
he
would
hear
of
nothing
she
said
if
he
had
left
us
what
would
the
treasure
be
to
that
horrible
treasure
it
has
brought
all
this
about
at
last
after
he
has
sobbed
his
very
heart
out
he
agrees
to
stay
on
a
condition
we
are
not
to
mention
this
matter
this
infamous
suspicion
not
even
to
mention
the
robbery
on
that
agreement
only
the
poor
cruel
boy
will
consent
to
remain
among
his
friends
this
inhibition
said
the
doctor
embargo
it
can
not
possibly
apply
to
me
all
of
us
anastasie
assured
him
cherished
one
desprez
protested
must
have
misunderstood
it
can
not
apply
to
me
he
would
naturally
come
to
me
she
said
does
i
swear
to
you
it
does
is
a
painful
a
very
painful
circumstance
the
doctor
said
looking
a
little
black
can
not
affect
anastasie
to
be
anything
but
justly
wounded
i
feel
this
i
feel
it
my
wife
acutely
knew
you
would
she
said
if
you
had
seen
his
distress
we
must
make
allowances
we
must
sacrifice
our
feelings
trust
my
dear
you
have
never
found
me
averse
to
sacrifices
returned
the
doctor
very
stiffly
you
will
let
me
go
and
tell
him
that
you
have
agreed
it
will
be
like
your
noble
nature
she
cried
so
it
would
he
perceived
it
would
be
like
his
noble
nature
up
jumped
his
spirits
triumphant
at
the
thought
darling
he
said
nobly
him
the
subject
is
buried
more
i
make
an
effort
i
have
accustomed
my
will
to
these
exertions
and
it
is
forgotten
a
little
after
but
still
with
swollen
eyes
and
looking
mortally
sheepish
reappeared
and
went
ostentatiously
about
his
business
he
was
the
only
unhappy
member
of
the
party
that
sat
down
that
night
to
supper
as
for
the
doctor
he
was
radiant
he
thus
sang
the
requiem
of
the
treasure
has
been
on
the
whole
a
most
amusing
episode
he
said
are
not
a
penny
the
worse
nay
we
are
immensely
gainers
our
philosophy
has
been
exercised
some
of
the
turtle
is
still
left
the
most
wholesome
of
delicacies
i
have
my
staff
anastasie
has
her
new
dress
is
the
proud
possessor
of
a
fashionable
kepi
besides
we
had
a
glass
of
hermitage
last
night
the
glow
still
suffuses
my
memory
i
was
growing
positively
niggardly
with
that
hermitage
positively
niggardly
let
me
take
the
hint
we
had
one
bottle
to
celebrate
the
appearance
of
our
visionary
fortune
let
us
have
a
second
to
console
us
for
its
occultation
the
third

hereby
dedicate
to
wedding
breakfast
chapter
vii
the
fall
of
the
house
of
desprez
the
doctor
house
has
not
yet
received
the
compliment
of
a
description
and
it
is
now
high
time
that
the
omission
were
supplied
for
the
house
is
itself
an
actor
in
the
story
and
one
whose
part
is
nearly
at
an
end
two
stories
in
height
walls
of
a
warm
yellow
tiles
of
an
ancient
ruddy
brown
diversified
with
moss
and
lichen
it
stood
with
one
wall
to
the
street
in
the
angle
of
the
doctor
property
it
was
roomy
draughty
and
inconvenient
the
large
rafters
were
here
and
there
engraven
with
rude
marks
and
patterns
the
handrail
of
the
stair
was
carved
in
countrified
arabesque
a
stout
timber
pillar
which
did
duty
to
support
the
roof
bore
mysterious
characters
on
its
darker
side
runes
according
to
the
doctor
nor
did
he
fail
when
he
ran
over
the
legendary
history
of
the
house
and
its
possessors
to
dwell
upon
the
scandinavian
scholar
who
had
left
them
floors
doors
and
rafters
made
a
great
variety
of
angles
every
room
had
a
particular
inclination
the
gable
had
tilted
towards
the
garden
after
the
manner
of
a
leaning
tower
and
one
of
the
former
proprietors
had
buttressed
the
building
from
that
side
with
a
great
strut
of
wood
like
the
derrick
of
a
crane
altogether
it
had
many
marks
of
ruin
it
was
a
house
for
the
rats
to
desert
and
nothing
but
its
excellent
brightness
the
polished
and
shining
the
paint
well
scoured
the
brasses
radiant
the
very
prop
all
wreathed
about
with
climbing
flowers
nothing
but
its
air
of
a
smiling
veteran
sitting
crutch
and
all
in
the
sunny
corner
of
a
garden
marked
it
as
a
house
for
comfortable
people
to
inhabit
in
poor
or
idle
management
it
would
soon
have
hurried
into
the
blackguard
stages
of
decay
as
it
was
the
whole
family
loved
it
and
the
doctor
was
never
better
inspired
than
when
he
narrated
its
imaginary
story
and
drew
the
character
of
its
successive
masters
from
the
hebrew
merchant
who
had
its
walls
after
the
sack
of
the
town
and
past
the
mysterious
engraver
of
the
runes
down
to
the
handed
boor
from
whom
he
had
himself
acquired
it
at
a
ruinous
expense
as
for
any
alarm
about
its
security
the
idea
had
never
presented
itself
what
had
stood
four
centuries
might
well
endure
a
little
longer
indeed
in
this
particular
winter
after
the
finding
and
losing
of
the
treasure
the
desprez
had
an
anxiety
of
a
very
different
order
and
one
which
lay
nearer
their
hearts
was
plainly
not
himself
he
had
fits
of
hectic
activity
when
he
made
unusual
exertions
to
please
spoke
more
and
faster
and
redoubled
in
attention
to
his
lessons
but
these
were
interrupted
by
spells
of
melancholia
and
brooding
silence
when
the
boy
was
little
better
than
unbearable
the
doctor
moralised
see
anastasie
what
comes
of
silence
had
the
boy
properly
unbosomed
himself
the
little
disappointment
about
the
treasure
the
little
annoyance
about
incivility
would
long
ago
have
been
forgotten
as
it
is
they
prey
upon
him
like
a
disease
he
loses
flesh
his
appetite
is
variable
and
on
the
whole
impaired
i
keep
him
on
the
strictest
regimen
i
exhibit
the
most
powerful
tonics
both
in
vain
you
think
you
drug
him
too
much
asked
madame
with
an
irrepressible
shudder
cried
the
doctor
drug
anastasie
you
are
mad
time
went
on
and
the
boy
health
still
slowly
declined
the
doctor
blamed
the
weather
which
was
cold
and
boisterous
he
called
in
his
from
bourron
took
a
fancy
for
him
magnified
his
capacity
and
was
pretty
soon
under
treatment
himself
it
scarcely
appeared
for
what
complaint
he
and
had
each
medicine
to
take
at
different
periods
of
the
day
the
doctor
used
to
lie
in
wait
for
the
exact
moment
watch
in
hand
is
nothing
like
regularity
he
would
say
fill
out
the
doses
and
dilate
on
the
virtues
of
the
draught
and
if
the
boy
seemed
none
the
better
the
doctor
was
not
at
all
the
worse
gunpowder
day
the
boy
was
particularly
low
it
was
scowling
squally
weather
huge
broken
companies
of
cloud
sailed
swiftly
overhead
raking
gleams
of
sunlight
swept
the
village
and
were
followed
by
intervals
of
darkness
and
white
flying
rain
at
times
the
wind
lifted
up
its
voice
and
bellowed
the
trees
were
all
scourging
themselves
along
the
meadows
the
last
leaves
flying
like
dust
the
doctor
between
the
boy
and
the
weather
was
in
his
element
he
had
a
theory
to
prove
he
sat
with
his
watch
out
and
a
barometer
in
front
of
him
waiting
for
the
squalls
and
noting
their
effect
upon
the
human
pulse
the
true
philosopher
he
remarked
delightedly
fact
in
nature
is
a
toy
a
letter
came
to
him
but
as
its
arrival
coincided
with
the
approach
of
another
gust
he
merely
crammed
it
into
his
pocket
gave
the
time
to
and
the
next
moment
they
were
both
counting
their
pulses
as
if
for
a
wager
at
nightfall
the
wind
rose
into
a
tempest
it
besieged
the
hamlet
apparently
from
every
side
as
if
with
batteries
of
cannon
the
houses
shook
and
groaned
live
coals
were
blown
upon
the
floor
the
uproar
and
terror
of
the
night
kept
people
long
awake
sitting
with
pallid
faces
giving
ear
it
was
twelve
before
the
desprez
family
retired
by
one
when
the
storm
was
already
somewhat
past
its
height
the
doctor
was
awakened
from
a
troubled
slumber
and
sat
up
a
noise
still
rang
in
his
ears
but
whether
of
this
world
or
the
world
of
dreams
he
was
not
certain
another
clap
of
wind
followed
it
was
accompanied
by
a
sickening
movement
of
the
whole
house
and
in
the
subsequent
lull
desprez
could
hear
the
tiles
pouring
like
a
cataract
into
the
loft
above
his
head
he
plucked
anastasie
bodily
out
of
bed
he
cried
thrusting
some
wearing
apparel
into
her
hands
house
is
falling
to
the
garden
she
did
not
pause
to
be
twice
bidden
she
was
down
the
stair
in
an
instant
she
had
never
before
suspected
herself
of
such
activity
the
doctor
meanwhile
with
the
speed
of
a
piece
of
pantomime
business
and
undeterred
by
broken
shins
proceeded
to
rout
out
tore
aline
from
her
virgin
slumbers
seized
her
by
the
hand
and
tumbled
downstairs
and
into
the
garden
with
the
girl
tumbling
behind
him
still
not
half
awake
the
fugitives
rendezvous
in
the
arbour
by
some
common
instinct
then
came
a
flash
of
struggling
moonshine
which
disclosed
their
four
figures
standing
huddled
from
the
wind
in
a
raffle
of
flying
drapery
and
not
without
a
considerable
need
for
more
at
the
humiliating
spectacle
anastasie
clutched
her
nightdress
desperately
about
her
and
burst
loudly
into
tears
the
doctor
flew
to
console
her
but
she
elbowed
him
away
she
suspected
everybody
of
being
the
general
public
and
thought
the
darkness
was
alive
with
eyes
another
gleam
and
another
violent
gust
arrived
together
the
house
was
seen
to
rock
on
its
foundation
and
just
as
the
light
was
once
more
eclipsed
a
crash
which
triumphed
over
the
shouting
of
the
wind
announced
its
fall
and
for
a
moment
the
whole
garden
was
alive
with
skipping
tiles
and
brickbats
one
such
missile
grazed
the
doctor
ear
another
descended
on
the
bare
foot
of
aline
who
instantly
made
night
hideous
with
her
shrieks
by
this
time
the
hamlet
was
alarmed
lights
flashed
from
the
windows
hails
reached
the
party
and
the
doctor
answered
nobly
contending
against
aline
and
the
tempest
but
this
prospect
of
help
only
awakened
anastasie
to
a
more
active
stage
of
terror
people
will
be
coming
she
screamed
in
her
husband
ear
trust
so
he
replied
can
not
i
would
rather
die
she
wailed
dear
said
the
doctor
reprovingly
are
excited
i
gave
you
some
clothes
what
have
you
done
with
them
i
do
know
i
must
have
thrown
them
away
where
are
they
she
sobbed
desprez
groped
about
in
the
darkness
he
remarked
grey
velveteen
trousers
this
will
exactly
meet
your
necessities
them
to
me
she
cried
fiercely
but
as
soon
as
she
had
them
in
her
hands
her
mood
appeared
to
alter
she
stood
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
pressed
the
garment
back
upon
the
doctor
it
to
aline
she
said
girl
said
the
doctor
does
not
know
what
she
is
about
aline
is
beside
herself
with
terror
and
at
any
rate
she
is
a
peasant
now
i
am
really
concerned
at
this
exposure
for
a
person
of
your
housekeeping
habits
my
solicitude
and
your
fantastic
modesty
both
point
to
the
same
remedy
the
pantaloons
he
held
them
ready
is
impossible
you
do
not
understand
she
said
with
dignity
by
this
time
rescue
was
at
hand
it
had
been
found
impracticable
to
enter
by
the
street
for
the
gate
was
blocked
with
masonry
and
the
nodding
ruin
still
threatened
further
avalanches
but
between
the
doctor
garden
and
the
one
on
the
right
hand
there
was
that
very
picturesque
contrivance
a
common
well
the
door
on
the
desprez
side
had
chanced
to
be
unbolted
and
now
through
the
arched
aperture
a
bearded
face
and
an
arm
supporting
a
lantern
were
introduced
into
the
world
of
windy
darkness
where
anastasie
concealed
her
woes
the
light
struck
here
and
there
among
the
tossing
apple
boughs
it
glinted
on
the
grass
but
the
lantern
and
the
glowing
face
became
the
centre
of
the
world
anastasie
crouched
back
from
the
intrusion
way
shouted
the
man
you
all
safe
aline
still
screaming
ran
to
the
new
comer
and
was
presently
hauled
through
the
wall
anastasie
come
on
it
is
your
turn
said
the
husband
can
not
she
replied
we
all
to
die
of
exposure
madame
thundered
doctor
desprez
can
go
she
cried
go
go
away
i
can
stay
here
i
am
quite
warm
the
doctor
took
her
by
the
shoulders
with
an
oath
she
screamed
will
put
them
on
she
took
the
detested
lendings
in
her
hand
once
more
but
her
repulsion
was
stronger
than
shame
she
cried
shuddering
and
flung
them
far
away
into
the
night
next
moment
the
doctor
had
whirled
her
to
the
well
the
man
was
there
and
the
lantern
anastasie
closed
her
eyes
and
appeared
to
herself
to
be
about
to
die
how
she
was
transported
through
the
arch
she
knew
not
but
once
on
the
other
side
she
was
received
by
the
neighbour
wife
and
enveloped
in
a
friendly
blanket
beds
were
made
ready
for
the
two
women
clothes
of
very
various
sizes
for
the
doctor
and
and
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
while
madame
dozed
in
and
out
on
the
borderland
of
hysterics
her
husband
sat
beside
the
fire
and
held
forth
to
the
admiring
neighbours
he
showed
them
at
length
the
causes
of
the
accident
for
years
he
explained
the
fall
had
been
impending
one
sign
had
followed
another
the
joints
had
opened
the
plaster
had
cracked
the
old
walls
bowed
inward
last
not
three
weeks
ago
the
cellar
door
had
begun
to
work
with
difficulty
in
its
grooves
cellar
he
said
gravely
shaking
his
head
over
a
glass
of
mulled
wine
reminds
me
of
my
poor
vintages
by
a
manifest
providence
the
hermitage
was
nearly
at
an
end
one
bottle
i
lose
but
one
bottle
of
that
incomparable
wine
it
had
been
set
apart
against
marie
wedding
well
i
must
lay
down
some
more
it
will
be
an
interest
in
life
i
am
however
a
man
somewhat
advanced
in
years
my
great
work
is
now
buried
in
the
fall
of
my
humble
roof
it
will
never
be
completed
my
name
will
have
been
writ
in
water
and
yet
you
find
me
calm
i
would
say
cheerful
can
your
priest
do
more
by
the
first
glimpse
of
day
the
party
sallied
forth
from
the
fireside
into
the
street
the
wind
had
fallen
but
still
charioted
a
world
of
troubled
clouds
the
air
bit
like
frost
and
the
party
as
they
stood
about
the
ruins
in
the
rainy
twilight
of
the
morning
beat
upon
their
breasts
and
blew
into
their
hands
for
warmth
the
house
had
entirely
fallen
the
walls
outward
the
roof
in
it
was
a
mere
heap
of
rubbish
with
here
and
there
a
forlorn
spear
of
broken
rafter
a
sentinel
was
placed
over
the
ruins
to
protect
the
property
and
the
party
adjourned
to
tentaillon
to
break
their
fast
at
the
doctor
expense
the
bottle
circulated
somewhat
freely
and
before
they
left
the
table
it
had
begun
to
snow
for
three
days
the
snow
continued
to
fall
and
the
ruins
covered
with
tarpaulin
and
watched
by
sentries
were
left
undisturbed
the
meanwhile
had
taken
up
their
abode
at
tentaillon
madame
spent
her
time
in
the
kitchen
concocting
little
delicacies
with
the
admiring
aid
of
madame
tentaillon
or
sitting
by
the
fire
in
thoughtful
abstraction
the
fall
of
the
house
affected
her
wonderfully
little
that
blow
had
been
parried
by
another
and
in
her
mind
she
was
continually
fighting
over
again
the
battle
of
the
trousers
had
she
done
right
had
she
done
wrong
and
now
she
would
applaud
her
determination
and
anon
with
a
horrid
flush
of
unavailing
penitence
she
would
regret
the
trousers
no
juncture
in
her
life
had
so
much
exercised
her
judgment
in
the
meantime
the
doctor
had
become
vastly
pleased
with
his
situation
two
of
the
summer
boarders
still
lingered
behind
the
rest
prisoners
for
lack
of
a
remittance
they
were
both
english
but
one
of
them
spoke
french
pretty
fluently
and
was
besides
a
humorous
fellow
with
whom
the
doctor
could
reason
by
the
hour
secure
of
comprehension
many
were
the
glasses
they
emptied
many
the
topics
they
discussed
the
doctor
said
on
the
third
morning
an
example
from
your
husband
from
the
excitement
has
done
more
for
the
boy
than
all
my
tonics
he
takes
his
turn
as
sentry
with
positive
gusto
as
for
me
you
behold
me
i
have
made
friends
with
the
egyptians
and
my
pharaoh
is
i
swear
it
a
most
agreeable
companion
you
alone
are
hipped
about
a
house
a
few
dresses
what
are
they
in
comparison
to
the
pharmacopoeia
the
labour
of
years
lying
buried
below
stones
and
sticks
in
this
depressing
hamlet
the
snow
falls
i
shake
it
from
my
cloak
imitate
me
our
income
will
be
impaired
i
grant
it
since
we
must
rebuild
but
moderation
patience
and
philosophy
will
gather
about
the
hearth
in
the
meanwhile
the
tentaillons
are
obliging
the
table
with
your
additions
will
pass
only
the
wine
is
execrable
well
i
shall
send
for
some
my
pharaoh
will
be
gratified
to
drink
a
decent
glass
aha
and
i
shall
see
if
he
possesses
that
acme
of
organisation
a
palate
if
he
has
a
palate
he
is
perfect
she
said
shaking
her
head
are
a
man
you
can
not
understand
my
feelings
no
woman
could
shake
off
the
memory
of
so
public
a
humiliation
the
doctor
could
not
restrain
a
titter
me
darling
he
said
really
to
the
philosophical
intelligence
the
incident
appears
so
small
a
trifle
you
looked
extremely
well
she
cried
well
i
will
say
no
more
he
replied
to
be
sure
if
you
had
consented
to
indue
he
broke
off
my
trousers
they
are
lying
in
the
snow
my
favourite
trousers
and
he
dashed
in
quest
of
two
hours
afterwards
the
boy
returned
to
the
inn
with
a
spade
under
one
arm
and
a
curious
sop
of
clothing
under
the
other
the
doctor
ruefully
took
it
in
his
hands
have
been
he
said
tense
is
past
excellent
pantaloons
you
are
no
more
stay
something
in
the
pocket
and
he
produced
a
piece
of
paper
letter
ay
now
i
mind
me
it
was
received
on
the
morning
of
the
gale
when
i
was
absorbed
in
delicate
investigations
it
is
still
legible
from
poor
dear
casimir
it
is
as
well
he
chuckled
i
have
educated
him
to
patience
poor
casimir
and
his
correspondence
his
infinitesimal
timorous
idiotic
correspondence
he
had
by
this
time
cautiously
unfolded
the
wet
letter
but
as
he
bent
himself
to
decipher
the
writing
a
cloud
descended
on
his
brow
he
cried
with
a
galvanic
start
and
then
the
letter
was
whipped
into
the
fire
and
the
doctor
cap
was
on
his
head
in
the
turn
of
a
hand
minutes
i
can
catch
it
if
i
run
he
cried
is
always
late
i
go
to
paris
i
shall
telegraph
what
is
wrong
cried
his
wife
bonds
came
from
the
disappearing
doctor
and
anastasie
and
were
left
face
to
face
with
the
wet
trousers
desprez
had
gone
to
paris
for
the
second
time
in
seven
years
he
had
gone
to
paris
with
a
pair
of
wooden
shoes
a
knitted
spencer
a
black
blouse
a
country
nightcap
and
twenty
francs
in
his
pocket
the
fall
of
the
house
was
but
a
secondary
marvel
the
whole
world
might
have
fallen
and
scarce
left
his
family
more
petrified
chapter
viii
the
wages
of
philosophy
on
the
morning
of
the
next
day
the
doctor
a
mere
spectre
of
himself
was
brought
back
in
the
custody
of
casimir
they
found
anastasie
and
the
boy
sitting
together
by
the
fire
and
desprez
who
had
exchanged
his
toilette
for
a
of
poor
materials
waved
his
hand
as
he
entered
and
sank
speechless
on
the
nearest
chair
madame
turned
direct
to
casimir
is
wrong
she
cried
replied
casimir
have
i
told
you
all
along
it
has
come
it
is
a
clean
shave
this
time
so
you
may
as
well
bear
up
and
make
the
best
of
it
house
down
too
eh
bad
luck
upon
my
soul
we
are
we
ruined
she
gasped
the
doctor
stretched
out
his
arms
to
her
he
replied
are
ruined
by
your
sinister
husband
casimir
observed
the
consequent
embrace
through
his
eyeglass
then
he
turned
to
hear
he
said
are
ruined
no
more
pickings
no
more
house
no
more
fat
cutlets
it
strikes
me
my
friend
that
you
had
best
be
packing
the
present
speculation
is
about
worked
out
and
he
nodded
to
him
meaningly
cried
desprez
springing
up
if
you
prefer
to
leave
me
now
that
i
am
poor
you
can
go
you
shall
receive
your
hundred
francs
if
so
much
remains
to
me
but
if
you
will
consent
to
stay
the
doctor
wept
a
little
offers
me
a
place
as
clerk
he
resumed
emoluments
are
slender
but
they
will
be
enough
for
three
it
is
too
much
already
to
have
lost
my
fortune
must
i
lose
my
son
sobbed
bitterly
but
without
a
word
do
like
boys
who
cry
observed
casimir
one
is
always
crying
here
you
clear
out
of
this
for
a
little
i
have
business
with
your
master
and
mistress
and
these
domestic
feelings
may
be
settled
after
i
am
gone
march
and
he
held
the
door
open
slunk
out
like
a
detected
thief
by
twelve
they
were
all
at
table
but
said
casimir
you
see
took
the
hint
at
once
do
not
i
confess
said
desprez
do
not
seek
to
excuse
his
absence
it
speaks
a
want
of
heart
that
disappoints
me
sorely
of
manners
corrected
casimir
he
never
had
why
desprez
for
a
clever
fellow
you
are
the
most
gullible
mortal
in
creation
your
ignorance
of
human
nature
and
human
business
is
beyond
belief
you
are
swindled
by
heathen
turks
swindled
by
vagabond
children
swindled
right
and
left
upstairs
and
downstairs
i
think
it
must
be
your
imagination
i
thank
my
stars
i
have
none
me
replied
desprez
still
humbly
but
with
a
return
of
spirit
at
sight
of
a
distinction
to
be
drawn
me
casimir
you
possess
even
to
an
eminent
degree
the
commercial
imagination
it
was
the
lack
of
that
in
me
it
appears
it
is
my
weak
point
that
has
led
to
these
repeated
shocks
by
the
commercial
imagination
the
financier
forecasts
the
destiny
of
his
investments
marks
the
falling
house
interrupted
casimir
friend
the
appears
to
have
his
share
of
it
the
doctor
was
silenced
and
the
meal
was
continued
and
finished
principally
to
the
tune
of
the
not
very
consolatory
conversation
he
entirely
ignored
the
two
young
english
painters
turning
a
blind
eyeglass
to
their
salutations
and
continuing
his
remarks
as
if
he
were
alone
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
and
with
every
second
word
he
ripped
another
stitch
out
of
the
air
balloon
of
desprez
vanity
by
the
time
coffee
was
over
the
poor
doctor
was
as
limp
as
a
napkin
us
go
and
see
the
ruins
said
casimir
they
strolled
forth
into
the
street
the
fall
of
the
house
like
the
loss
of
a
front
tooth
had
quite
transformed
the
village
through
the
gap
the
eye
commanded
a
great
stretch
of
open
snowy
country
and
the
place
shrank
in
comparison
it
was
like
a
room
with
an
open
door
the
sentinel
stood
by
the
green
gate
looking
very
red
and
cold
but
he
had
a
pleasant
word
for
the
doctor
and
his
wealthy
kinsman
casimir
looked
at
the
mound
of
ruins
he
tried
the
quality
of
the
tarpaulin
he
said
hope
the
cellar
arch
has
stood
if
it
has
my
good
brother
i
will
give
you
a
good
price
for
the
wines
shall
start
digging
said
the
sentry
is
no
more
fear
of
snow
friend
returned
casimir
sententiously
had
better
wait
till
you
get
paid
the
doctor
winced
and
began
dragging
his
offensive
towards
tentaillon
in
the
house
there
would
be
fewer
auditors
and
these
already
in
the
secret
of
his
fall
cried
casimir
goes
the
with
his
luggage
no
egad
he
is
taking
it
into
the
inn
and
sure
enough
was
seen
to
cross
the
snowy
street
and
enter
tentaillon
staggering
under
a
large
hamper
the
doctor
stopped
with
a
sudden
wild
hope
can
he
have
he
said
us
go
and
see
and
he
hurried
on
luggage
to
be
sure
answered
casimir
is
on
the
move
thanks
to
the
commercial
imagination
have
not
seen
that
hamper
for
for
ever
so
long
remarked
the
doctor
will
you
see
it
much
longer
chuckled
casimir
indeed
we
interfere
and
by
the
way
i
insist
on
an
examination
will
not
require
said
desprez
positively
with
a
sob
and
casting
a
moist
triumphant
glance
at
casimir
he
began
to
run
the
devil
is
up
with
him
i
wonder
casimir
reflected
and
then
curiosity
taking
the
upper
hand
he
followed
the
doctor
example
and
took
to
his
heels
the
hamper
was
so
heavy
and
large
and
himself
so
little
and
so
weary
that
it
had
taken
him
a
great
while
to
bundle
it
upstairs
to
the
desprez
private
room
and
he
had
just
set
it
down
on
the
floor
in
front
of
anastasie
when
the
doctor
arrived
and
was
closely
followed
by
the
man
of
business
boy
and
hamper
were
both
in
a
most
sorry
plight
for
the
one
had
passed
four
months
underground
in
a
certain
cave
on
the
way
to
acheres
and
the
other
had
run
about
five
miles
as
hard
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
half
that
distance
under
a
staggering
weight
cried
the
doctor
in
a
voice
that
was
only
too
seraphic
to
be
called
hysterical
it
it
is
he
cried
my
son
my
son
and
he
sat
down
upon
the
hamper
and
sobbed
like
a
little
child
will
not
go
to
paris
now
said
sheepishly
said
desprez
raising
his
wet
face
you
see
that
boy
that
angel
boy
he
is
the
thief
he
took
the
treasure
from
a
man
unfit
to
be
entrusted
with
its
use
he
brings
it
back
to
me
when
i
am
sobered
and
humbled
these
casimir
are
the
fruits
of
my
teaching
and
this
moment
is
the
reward
of
my
life

oneself
as

it
was

belief
in
