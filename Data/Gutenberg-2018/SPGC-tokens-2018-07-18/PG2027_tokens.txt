introductory
note
jean
baptiste
poquelin
better
known
by
his
stage
name
of
moliere
stands
without
a
rival
at
the
head
of
french
comedy
born
at
paris
in
january
where
his
father
held
a
position
in
the
royal
household
he
was
educated
at
the
jesuit
college
de
clermont
and
for
some
time
studied
law
which
he
soon
abandoned
for
the
stage
his
life
was
spent
in
paris
and
in
the
provinces
acting
directing
performances
managing
theaters
and
writing
plays
he
had
his
share
of
applause
from
the
king
and
from
the
public
but
the
satire
in
his
comedies
made
him
many
enemies
and
he
was
the
object
of
the
most
venomous
attacks
and
the
most
impossible
slanders
nor
did
he
find
much
solace
at
home
for
he
married
unfortunately
and
the
unhappiness
that
followed
increased
the
bitterness
that
public
hostility
had
brought
into
his
life
on
february
while
acting
in
la
malade
imaginaire
the
last
of
his
masterpieces
he
was
seized
with
illness
and
died
a
few
hours
later
the
first
of
the
greater
works
of
moliere
was
les
precieuses
ridicules
produced
in
in
this
brilliant
piece
moliere
lifted
french
comedy
to
a
new
level
and
gave
it
a
new
purpose
the
satirizing
of
contemporary
manners
and
affectations
by
frank
portrayal
and
criticism
in
the
great
plays
that
followed
the
school
for
husbands
and
the
school
for
wives
the
misanthrope
and
the
hypocrite
tartuffe
the
miser
and
the
hypochondriac
the
learned
ladies
the
doctor
in
spite
of
himself
the
citizen
turned
gentleman
and
many
others
he
exposed
mercilessly
one
after
another
the
vices
and
foibles
of
the
day
his
characteristic
qualities
are
nowhere
better
exhibited
than
in
tartuffe
compared
with
such
characterization
as
shakespeare
moliere
method
of
portraying
life
may
seem
to
be
lacking
in
complexity
but
it
is
precisely
the
simplicity
with
which
creations
like
tartuffe
embody
the
weakness
or
vice
they
represent
that
has
given
them
their
place
as
universally
recognized
types
of
human

mother

extravagant

it
offends
me
to
see

please
her
husband

sir
as
for
you
the
lady
brother
i
esteem
you
highly
love
and
respect
you
but
sir
all
the
same
if
i
were
in
my
son
her
husband
place
i
urgently
entreat
you
not
to
come
within
our
doors
you
preach
a
way
of
living
that
decent
people
can
not
tolerate
i
rather
frank
with
you
but
that
my
way
i
do
mince
matters
when
i
mean
a
thing
damis
tartuffe
your
friend
is
mighty
lucky
madame
pernelle
he
is
a
holy
man
and
must
be
heeded
i
ca
endure
with
any
show
of
patience
to
hear
a
scatterbrains
like
you
attack
him
damis
what
shall
i
let
a
bigot
criticaster
come
and
usurp
a
tyrant
power
here
and
shall
we
never
dare
amuse
ourselves
till
this
fine
gentleman
deigns
to
consent
dorine
if
we
must
hark
to
him
and
heed
his
maxims
there
not
a
thing
we
do
but
what
a
crime
he
censures
everything
this
zealous
carper
madame
pernelle
and
all
he
censures
is
well
censured
too
he
wants
to
guide
you
on
the
way
to
heaven
my
son
should
train
you
all
to
love
him
well
damis
no
madam
look
you
nothing
not
my
father
nor
anything
can
make
me
tolerate
him
i
should
belie
my
feelings
not
to
say
so
his
actions
rouse
my
wrath
at
every
turn
and
i
foresee
that
there
must
come
of
it
an
open
rupture
with
this
sneaking
scoundrel
dorine
besides
is
downright
scandalous
to
see
this
unknown
upstart
master
of
the
house
this
vagabond
who
had
when
he
came
shoes
to
his
feet
or
clothing
worth
six
farthings
and
who
so
far
forgets
his
place
as
now
to
censure
everything
and
rule
the
roost
madame
pernelle
eh
mercy
sakes
alive
things
would
go
better
if
all
were
governed
by
his
pious
orders
dorine
he
passes
for
a
saint
in
your
opinion
in
fact
he
nothing
but
a
hypocrite
madame
pernelle
just
listen
to
her
tongue
dorine
i
would
trust
him
nor
yet
his
lawrence
without
bonds
and
surety
madame
pernelle
i
do
know
what
the
servant
character
may
be
but
i
can
guarantee
the
master
a
holy
man
you
hate
him
and
reject
him
because
he
tells
home
truths
to
all
of
you
is
sin
alone
that
moves
his
heart
to
anger
and
heaven
interest
is
his
only
motive
dorine
of
course
but
why
especially
of
late
can
he
let
nobody
come
near
the
house
is
heaven
offended
at
a
civil
call
that
he
should
make
so
great
a
fuss
about
it
i
tell
you
if
you
like
just
what
i
think
pointing
to
elmire
upon
my
word
he
jealous
of
our
mistress
madame
pernelle
you
hold
your
tongue
and
think
what
you
are
saying
he
not
alone
in
censuring
these
visits
the
turmoil
that
attends
your
sort
of
people
their
carriages
forever
at
the
door
and
all
their
noisy
footmen
flocked
together
annoy
the
neighbourhood
and
raise
a
scandal
i
gladly
think
there
nothing
really
wrong
but
it
makes
talk
and
that
not
as
it
should
be
cleante
eh
madam
can
you
hope
to
keep
folk
tongues
from
wagging
it
would
be
a
grievous
thing
if
for
the
fear
of
idle
talk
about
us
we
had
to
sacrifice
our
friends
no
no
even
if
we
could
bring
ourselves
to
do
it
think
you
that
everyone
would
then
be
silenced
against
backbiting
there
is
no
defence
so
let
us
try
to
live
in
innocence
to
silly
tattle
pay
no
heed
at
all
and
leave
the
gossips
free
to
vent
their
gall
dorine
our
neighbour
daphne
and
her
little
husband
must
be
the
ones
who
slander
us
i
thinking
those
whose
own
conduct
most
ridiculous
are
always
quickest
to
speak
ill
of
others
they
never
fail
to
seize
at
once
upon
the
slightest
hint
of
any
love
affair
and
spread
the
news
of
it
with
glee
and
give
it
the
character
they
have
the
world
believe
in
by
others
actions
painted
in
their
colours
they
hope
to
justify
their
own
they
think
in
the
false
hope
of
some
resemblance
either
to
make
their
own
intrigues
seem
innocent
or
else
to
make
their
neighbours
share
the
blame
which
they
are
loaded
with
by
everybody
madame
pernelle
these
arguments
are
nothing
to
the
purpose
orante
we
all
know
lives
a
perfect
life
her
thoughts
are
all
of
heaven
and
i
have
heard
that
she
condemns
the
company
you
keep
dorine
o
admirable
pattern
virtuous
dame
she
lives
the
model
of
austerity
but
age
has
brought
this
piety
upon
her
and
she
a
prude
now
she
ca
help
herself
as
long
as
she
could
capture
men
attentions
she
made
the
most
of
her
advantages
but
now
she
sees
her
beauty
vanishing
she
wants
to
leave
the
world
that
leaving
her
and
in
the
specious
veil
of
haughty
virtue
she
hide
the
weakness
of
her
charms
that
is
the
way
with
all
your
old
coquettes
they
find
it
hard
to
see
their
lovers
leave
and
thus
abandoned
their
forlorn
estate
can
find
no
occupation
but
a
prude
these
pious
dames
in
their
austerity
must
carp
at
everything
and
pardon
nothing
they
loudly
blame
their
neighbours
way
of
living
not
for
religion
sake
but
out
of
envy
because
they
ca
endure
to
see
another
enjoy
the
pleasures
age
has
weaned
them
from
madame
pernelle
to
elmire
there
that
the
kind
of
rigmarole
to
please
you
one
never
has
a
chance
to
get
a
word
in
edgewise
at
your
house
because
this
lady
holds
the
floor
all
day
but
none
the
less
i
mean
to
have
my
say
too
i
tell
you
that
my
son
did
nothing
wiser
in
all
his
life
than
take
this
godly
man
into
his
household
heaven
sent
him
here
in
your
great
need
to
make
you
all
repent
for
your
salvation
you
must
hearken
to
him
he
censures
nothing
but
deserves
his
censure
these
visits
these
assemblies
and
these
balls
are
all
inventions
of
the
evil
spirit
you
never
hear
a
word
of
godliness
at
them
but
idle
cackle
nonsense
flimflam
our
neighbour
often
comes
in
for
a
share
the
talk
flies
fast
and
scandal
fills
the
air
it
makes
a
sober
person
head
go
round
at
these
assemblies
just
to
hear
the
sound
of
so
much
gab
with
not
a
word
to
say
and
as
a
learned
man
remarked
one
day
most
aptly
is
the
tower
of
babylon
where
all
beyond
all
limit
babble
on
and
just
to
tell
you
how
this
point
came
in
to
cleante
so
now
the
gentlemen
must
snicker
must
he
go
find
fools
like
yourself
to
make
you
laugh
and
do
to
elmire
daughter
not
one
word
more
as
for
this
house
i
leave

a

surely
tell
you
you
too
good
by

that
she
not
so
old

how
she
got
angry
with
us
all
for
nothing
and
how
she
seems
possessed
with
her
tartuffe
dorine
her
case
is
nothing
though
beside
her
son
to
see
him
you
would
say
he
ten
times
worse
his
conduct
in
our
late
unpleasantness
had
won
him
much
esteem
and
proved
his
courage
in
service
of
his
king
but
now
he
like
a
man
besotted
since
he
been
so
taken
with
this
tartuffe
he
calls
him
brother
loves
him
a
hundred
times
as
much
as
mother
son
daughter
and
wife
he
tells
him
all
his
secrets
and
lets
him
guide
his
acts
and
rule
his
conscience
he
fondles
and
embraces
him
a
sweetheart
could
not
i
think
be
loved
more
tenderly
at
table
he
must
have
the
seat
of
honour
while
with
delight
our
master
sees
him
eat
as
much
as
six
men
could
we
must

his

he
lost
in
constant
admiration
quotes
him
on
all
occasions
takes
his
trifling
acts
for
wonders
and
his
words
for
oracles
the
fellow
knows
his
dupe
and
makes
the
most
o
he
fools
him
with
a
hundred
masks
of
virtue
gets
money
from
him
all
the
time
by
canting
and
takes
upon
himself
to
carp
at
us
even
his
silly
coxcomb
of
a
lackey
makes
it
his
business
to
instruct
us
too
he
comes
with
rolling
eyes
to
preach
at
us
and
throws
away
our
ribbons
rouge
and
patches
the
wretch
the
other
day
tore
up
a
kerchief
that
he
had
found
pressed
in

calling
it
a
horrid
crime
for
us

note
inserted
in

of

it
is
a
curious
illustration
of
the
desire
for
uniformity
and
dignity
of
style
in
dramatic
verse
of
the
seventeenth
century

blood
that
she
had
lost
he
drank
at
breakfast
four
huge
draughts
of
wine
orgon
poor
man
dorine
so
now
they
both
are
doing
well
and
i
go
straightway
and
inform
my
mistress
how
pleased
you
are
at
her
recovery
scene
vi
orgon
cleante
cleante
brother
she
ridicules
you
to
your
face
and
i
though
i
do
want
to
make
you
angry
must
tell
you
candidly
that
she
quite
right
was
such
infatuation
ever
heard
of
and
can
a
man
have
charms
to
make
you
forget
all
else
relieve
his
poverty
give
him
a
home
and
then
orgon
stop
there
good
brother
you
do
not
know
the
man
you
speaking
of
cleante
since
you
will
have
it
so
i
do
not
know
him
but
after
all
to
tell
what
sort
of
man
he
is
orgon
dear
brother
you
be
charmed
to
know
him
your
raptures
over
him
would
have
no
end
he
is
a
man
who
ah
in
fact
a
man
whoever
does
his
will
knows
perfect
peace
and
counts
the
whole
world
else
as
so
much
dung
his
converse
has
transformed
me
quite
he
weans
my
heart
from
every
friendship
teaches
me
to
have
no
love
for
anything
on
earth
and
i
could
see
my
brother
children
mother
and
wife
all
die
and
never
care
a
snap
cleante
your
feelings
are
humane
i
must
say
brother
orgon
ah
if
you
seen
him
as
i
saw
him
first
you
would
have
loved
him
just
as
much
as
i
he
came
to
church
each
day
with
contrite
mien
kneeled
on
both
knees
right
opposite
my
place
and
drew
the
eyes
of
all
the
congregation
to
watch
the
fervour
of
his
prayers
to
heaven
with
sighs
and
great
ejaculations
he
humbly
kissed
the
earth
at
every
moment
and
when
i
left
the
church
he
ran
before
me
to
give
me
holy
water
at
the
door
i
learned
his
poverty
and
who
he
was
by
questioning
his
servant
who
is
like
him
and
gave
him
gifts
but
in
his
modesty
he
always
wanted
to
return
a
part
it
is
too
much
he
say
too
much
by
half
i
am
not
worthy
of
your
pity
then
when
i
refused
to
take
it
back
he
go
before
my
eyes
and
give
it
to
the
poor
at
length
heaven
bade
me
take
him
to
my
home
and
since
that
day
all
seems
to
prosper
here
he
censures
everything
and
for
my
sake
he
even
takes
great
interest
in
my
wife
he
lets
me
know
who
ogles
her
and
seems
six
times
as
jealous
as
i
am
myself
you
not
believe
how
far
his
zeal
can
go
he
calls
himself
a
sinner
just
for
trifles
the
merest
nothing
is
enough
to
shock
him
so
much
so
that
the
other
day
i
heard
him
accuse
himself
for
having
while
at
prayer
in
too
much
anger
caught
and
killed
a
flea
cleante
zounds
brother
you
are
mad
i
think
or
else
you
making
sport
of
me
with
such
a
speech
what
are
you
driving
at
with
all
this
nonsense
orgon
brother
your
language
smacks
of
atheism
and
i
suspect
your
soul
a
little
tainted
therewith
i
preached
to
you
a
score
of
times
that
you
draw
down
some
judgment
on
your
head
cleante
that
is
the
usual
strain
of
all
your
kind
they
must
have
every
one
as
blind
as
they
they
call
you
atheist
if
you
have
good
eyes
and
if
you
do
adore
their
vain
grimaces
you
neither
faith
nor
care
for
sacred
things
no
no
such
talk
ca
frighten
me
i
know
what
i
am
saying
heaven
sees
my
heart
we
not
the
dupes
of
all
your
canting
mummers
there
are
false
heroes
and
false
devotees
and
as
true
heroes
never
are
the
ones
who
make
much
noise
about
their
deeds
of
honour
just
so
true
devotees
whom
we
should
follow
are
not
the
ones
who
make
so
much
vain
show
what
will
you
find
no
difference
between
hypocrisy
and
genuine
devoutness
and
will
you
treat
them
both
alike
and
pay
the
honour
both
to
masks
and
faces
set
artifice
beside
sincerity
confuse
the
semblance
with
reality
esteem
a
phantom
like
a
living
person
and
counterfeit
as
good
as
honest
coin
men
for
the
most
part
are
strange
creatures
truly
you
never
find
them
keep
the
golden
mean
the
limits
of
good
sense
too
narrow
for
them
must
always
be
passed
by
in
each
direction
they
often
spoil
the
noblest
things
because
they
go
too
far
and
push
them
to
extremes
i
merely
say
this
by
the
way
good
brother
orgon
you
are
the
sole
expounder
of
the
doctrine
wisdom
shall
die
with
you
no
doubt
good
brother
you
are
the
only
wise
the
sole
enlightened
the
oracle
the
cato
of
our
age
all
men
compared
to
you
are
downright
fools
cleante
i
not
the
sole
expounder
of
the
doctrine
and
wisdom
shall
not
die
with
me
good
brother
but
this
i
know
though
it
be
all
my
knowledge
that
there
a
difference
false
and
true
and
as
i
find
no
kind
of
hero
more
to
be
admired
than
men
of
true
religion
nothing
more
noble
or
more
beautiful
than
is
the
holy
zeal
of
true
devoutness
just
so
i
think
there
naught
more
odious
than
whited
sepulchres
of
outward
unction
those
barefaced
charlatans
those
hireling
zealots
whose
sacrilegious
treacherous
pretence
deceives
at
will
and
with
impunity
makes
mockery
of
all
that
men
hold
sacred
men
who
enslaved
to
selfish
interests
make
trade
and
merchandise
of
godliness
and
try
to
purchase
influence
and
office
with
false
and
affected
raptures
those
men
i
say
who
with
uncommon
zeal
seek
their
own
fortunes
on
the
road
to
heaven
who
skilled
in
prayer
have
always
much
to
ask
and
live
at
court
to
preach
retirement
who
reconcile
religion
with
their
vices
are
quick
to
anger
vengeful
faithless
tricky
and
to
destroy
a
man
will
have
the
boldness
to
call
their
private
grudge
the
cause
of
heaven
all
the
more
dangerous
since
in
their
anger
they
use
against
us
weapons
men
revere
and
since
they
make
the
world
applaud
their
passion
and
seek
to
stab
us
with
a
sacred
sword
there
are
too
many
of
this
canting
kind
still
the
sincere
are
easy
to
distinguish
and
many
splendid
patterns
may
be
found
in
our
own
time
before
our
very
eyes
look
at
ariston
periandre
oronte
alcidamas
clitandre
and
polydore
no
one
denies
their
claim
to
true
religion
yet
they
no
braggadocios
of
virtue
they
do
not
make
insufferable
display
and
their
religion
human
tractable
they
are
not
always
judging
all
our
actions
they
think
such
judgment
savoured
of
presumption
and
leaving
pride
of
words
to
other
men
is
by
their
deeds
alone
they
censure
ours
evil
appearances
find
little
credit
with
them
they
even
incline
to
think
the
best
of
others
no
caballers
no
intriguers
they
mind
the
business
of
their
own
right
living
they
do
attack
a
sinner
tooth
and
nail
for
sin
the
only
object
of
their
hatred
nor
are
they
to
attempt
far
more
in
heaven
behalf
than
heaven
would
have
that
is
my
kind
of
man
that
is
true
living
that
is
the
pattern
we
should
set
ourselves
your
fellow
was
not
fashioned
on
this
model
you
quite
sincere
in
boasting
of
his
zeal

on
us
so
dorine
upon
my
word
i
do
know
how
the
rumour
got
started
if
was
or
mere
chance
but
i
had
heard
already
of
this
match
and
treated
it
as
utter
stuff
and
nonsense
orgon
what
is
the
thing
incredible
dorine
so
much
so
i
do
believe
it
even
from
yourself
sir
orgon
i
know
a
way
to
make
you
credit
it
dorine
no
no
you
telling
us
a
fairly
tale
orgon
i
telling
you
just
what
will
happen
shortly
dorine
stuff
orgon
daughter
what
i
say
is
in
good
earnest
dorine
there
there
do
take
your
father
seriously
he
fooling
orgon
but
i
tell
you
dorine
no
no
use
they
wo
believe
you
orgon
if
i
let
my
anger
dorine
well
then
we
do
believe
you
and
the
worse
for
you
it
is
what
can
a
man
with
that
expanse
of
beard
across
his
face
be
mad
enough
to
want
orgon
you
hark
me
you
taken
on
yourself
here
in
this
house
a
sort
of
free
familiarity
that
i
do
like
i
tell
you
frankly
girl
dorine
there
there
let
not
get
angry
sir
i
beg
you
but
are
you
making
game
of
everybody
your
daughter
not
cut
out
for
bigot
meat
and
he
has
more
important
things
to
think
of
besides
what
can
you
gain
by
such
a
match
how
can
a
man
of
wealth
like
you
go
choose
a
wretched
vagabond
for
orgon
you
hold
your
tongue
and
know
the
less
he
has
the
better
cause
have
we
to
honour
him
his
poverty
is
honest
poverty
it
should
exalt
him
more
than
worldly
grandeur
for
he
has
let
himself
be
robbed
of
all
through
careless
disregard
of
temporal
things
and
fixed
attachment
to
the
things
eternal
my
help
may
set
him
on
his
feet
again
win
back
his
property
a
fair
estate
he
has
at
home
so
i
informed
and
prove
him
for
what
he
is
a
gentleman
dorine
yes
so
he
says
himself
such
vanity
but
ill
accords
with
pious
living
sir
the
man
who
cares
for
holiness
alone
should
not
so
loudly
boast
his
name
and
birth
the
humble
ways
of
genuine
devoutness
brook
not
so
much
display
of
earthly
pride
why
should
he
be
so
vain
but
i
offend
you
let
leave
his
rank
then
take
the
man
himself
can
you
without
compunction
give
a
man
like
him
possession
of
a
girl
like
her
think
what
a
scandal
sure
to
come
of
it
virtue
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
fates
when
a
girl
married
to
a
man
she
hates
the
best
intent
to
live
an
honest
woman
depends
upon
the
husband
being
human
and
men
whose
brows
are
pointed
at
afar
may
thank
themselves
their
wives
are
what
they
are
for
to
be
true
is
more
than
woman
can
with
husbands
built
upon
a
certain
plan
and
he
who
weds
his
child
against
her
will
owes
heaven
account
for
it
if
she
do
ill
think
then
what
perils
wait
on
your
design
orgon
to
mariane
so
i
must
learn
what
what
from
her
you
see
dorine
you
might
do
worse
than
follow
my
advice
orgon
daughter
we
ca
waste
time
upon
this
nonsense
i
know
what
good
for
you
and
i
your
father
true
i
had
promised
you
to
young
valere
but
first
they
tell
me

inclined
to
gamble
and
then
i
fear
his
faith
is
not
quite
sound
i
have
noticed
that
he
regular
at
church
dorine
you
have
him
run
there
just
when
you
do
like
those
who
go
on
purpose
to
be
seen
orgon
i
do
ask
your
opinion
on
the
matter
in
short
the
other
is
in
heaven

graces
and
that
is
riches
quite
beyond
compare
this
match

you
every
joy

in
sweetness
and
delight

phiz
orgon
so
that
although
you
may
not
care
at
all
for
his
best
qualities
dorine
a
handsome
dowry
orgon
turns
and
stands
in
front
of
her
with
arms
folded
eyeing
her
were
i
in
her
place
any
man
should
rue
it
who
married
me
by
force
that
mighty
certain
i
let
him
know
and
that
within
a
week
a
woman
vengeance
is
far
to
seek
orgon
to
dorine
so
nothing
that
i
say
has
any
weight
dorine
eh
what
wrong
now
i
did
speak
to
you
orgon
what
were
you
doing
dorine
talking
to
myself
orgon
oh
very
well
aside
her
monstrous
impudence
must
be
chastised
with
one
good
slap
in
the
face
he
stands
ready
to
strike
her
and
each
time
he
speaks
to
his
daughter
he
glances
toward
her
but
she
stands
still
and
says
not
a
word
footnote
as
given
at
the
comedie
francaise
the
action
is
as
follows
while
orgon
says
you
must
approve
of
my
design
dorine
is
making
signs
to
mariane
to
resist
his
orders
orgon
turns
around
suddenly
but
dorine
quickly
changes
her
gesture
and
with
the
hand
which
she
had
lifted
calmly
arranges
her
hair
and
her
cap
orgon
goes
on
think
of
the
husband
and
stops
before
the
middle
of
his
sentence
to
turn
and
catch
the
beginning
of
dorine
gesture
but
he
is
too
quick
this
time
and
dorine
stands
looking
at
his
furious
countenance
with
a
sweet
and
gentle
expression
he
turns
and
goes
on
and
the
obstinate
dorine
again
lifts
her
hand
behind
his
shoulder
to
urge
mariane
to
resistance
this
time
he
catches
her
but
just
as
he
swings
his
shoulder
to
give
her
the
promised
blow
she
stops
him
by
changing
the
intent
of
her
gesture
and
carefully
picking
from
the
top
of
his
sleeve
a
bit
of
fluff
which
she
holds
carefully
between
her
fingers
then
blows
into
the
air
and
watches
intently
as
it
floats
away
orgon
is
paralysed
by
her
innocence
of
expression
and
compelled
to
hide
his
regnier
tartuffe
des
orgon
daughter
you
must
approve
of
my
design
think
of
this
husband
i
have
chosen
for
you
to
dorine
why
do
you
talk
to
yourself
dorine
nothing
to
say
orgon
one
little
word
more
dorine
oh
no
thanks
not
now
orgon
sure
i
have
caught
you
dorine
faith
i
no
such
fool
orgon
so
daughter
now
obedience
is
the
word
you
must
accept
my
choice
with
reverence
dorine
running
away
you
never
catch
me
marrying
such
a
creature
orgon
swinging
his
hand
at
her
and
missing
her
daughter
you
such
a
pestilent
hussy
there
i
ca
live
with
her
longer
without
sin
i
ca
discuss
things
in
the
state
i
in
my
mind
so
flustered
by
her
insolent
talk
to
calm
myself
i
must
go
take
a
walk
scene
iii
mariane
dorine
dorine
say
have
you
lost
the
tongue
from
out
your
head
and
must
i
speak
your
role
from
a
to
zed
you
let
them
broach
a
project
that
absurd
and
do
oppose
it
with
a
single
word
mariane
what
can
i
do
my
father
is
the
master
dorine
do
everything
to
ward
off
such
disaster
mariane
but
what
dorine
tell
him
one
does
love
by
proxy
tell
him
you
marry
for
yourself
not
him
since
you
the
one
for
whom
the
thing
is
done
you
are
the
one
not
he
the
man
must
please
if
his
tartuffe
has
charmed
him
so
why
let
him
just
marry
him
himself
no
one
will
hinder
mariane
a
father
rights
are
such
it
seems
to
me
that
i
could
never
dare
to
say
a
word
dorine
came
talk
it
out
valere
has
asked
your
hand
now
do
you
love
him
pray
or
do
you
not
mariane
dorine
how
can
you
wrong
my
love
so
much
and
ask
me
such
a
question
have
i
not
a
hundred
times
laid
bare
my
heart
to
you
do
you
know
how
ardently
i
love
him
dorine
how
do
i
know
if
heart
and
words
agree
and
if
in
honest
truth
you
really
love
him
mariane
dorine
you
wrong
me
greatly
if
you
doubt
it
i
shown
my
inmost
feelings
all
too
plainly
dorine
so
then
you
love
him
mariane
yes
devotedly
dorine
and
he
returns
your
love
apparently
mariane
i
think
so
dorine
and
you
both
alike
are
eager
to
be
well
married
to
each
other
mariane
surely
dorine
then
what
your
plan
about
this
other
match
mariane
to
kill
myself
if
it
is
forced
upon
me
dorine
good
that
a
remedy
i
had
thought
of
just
die
and
everything
will
be
all
right
this
medicine
is
marvellous
indeed
it
drives
me
mad
to
hear
folk
talk
such
nonsense
mariane
oh
dear
dorine
you
get
in
such
a
temper
you
have
no
sympathy
for
people
troubles
dorine
i
have
no
sympathy
when
folk
talk
nonsense
and
flatten
out
as
you
do
at
a
pinch
mariane
but
what
can
you
expect
if
one
is
timid
dorine
but
what
is
love
worth
if
it
has
no
courage
mariane
am
i
not
constant
in
my
love
for
him
not
his
place
to
win
me
from
my
father
dorine
but
if
your
father
is
a
crazy
fool
and
quite
bewitched
with
his
tartuffe
and
breaks
his
bounden
word
is
that
your
lover
fault
mariane
but
shall
i
publicly
refuse
and
scorn
this
match
and
make
it
plain
that
i
in
love
shall
i
cast
off
for
him
he
be
womanly
modesty
and
filial
duty
you
ask
me
to
display
my
love
in
public
dorine
no
no
i
ask
you
nothing
you
shall
be
mister
tartuffe
why
now
i
think
of
it
i
should
be
wrong
to
turn
you
from
this
marriage
what
cause
can
i
have
to
oppose
your
wishes
so
fine
a
match

excellent
good

of
news

valere
i
gave
it
truly
to
oblige
you
madam
mariane
and
i
shall
take
it
to
oblige
you
sir
dorine
withdrawing
to
the
back
of
the
stage
let
see
what
this
affair
will
come
to
valere
so
that
is
your
love
and
it
was
all
deceit
when
you
mariane
i
beg
you
say
no
more
of
that
you
told
me
squarely
sir
i
should
accept
the
husband
that
is
offered
me
and
i
will
tell
you
squarely
that
i
mean
to
do
so
since
you
have
given
me
this
good
advice
valere
do
shield
yourself
with
talk
of
my
advice
you
had
your
mind
made
up
that
evident
and
now
you
snatching
at
a
trifling
pretext
to
justify
the
breaking
of
your
word
mariane
exactly
so
valere
of
course
it
is
your
heart
has
never
known
true
love
for
me
mariane
alas
you
free
to
think
so
if
you
please
valere
yes
yes
i
free
to
think
so
and
my
outraged
love
may
yet
forestall
you
in
your
perfidy
and
offer
elsewhere
both
my
heart
and
hand
mariane
no
doubt
of
it
the
love
your
high
deserts
may
win
valere
good
lord
have
done
with
my
deserts
i
know
i
have
but
few
and
you
have
proved
it
but
i
may
find
more
kindness
in
another
i
know
of
someone
who
not
be
ashamed
to
take
your
leavings
and
make
up
my
loss
mariane
the
loss
is
not
so
great
you
easily
console
yourself
completely
for
this
change
valere
i
try
my
best
that
you
may
well
believe
when
we
forgotten
by
a
woman
heart
our
pride
is
challenged
we
too
must
forget
or
if
we
can
not
must
at
least
pretend
to
no
other
way
can
man
such
baseness
prove
as
be
a
lover
scorned
and
still
in
love
mariane
in
faith
a
high
and
noble
sentiment
valere
yes
and
it
one
that
all
men
must
approve
what
would
you
have
me
keep
my
love
alive
and
see
you
fly
into
another
arms
before
my
very
eyes
and
never
offer
to
someone
else
the
heart
that
you
had
scorned
mariane
oh
no
indeed
for
my
part
i
could
wish
that
it
were
done
already
valere
what
you
wish
it
mariane
yes
valere
this
is
insult
heaped
on
injury
i
go
at
once
and
do
as
you
desire
he
takes
a
step
or
two
as
if
to
go
away
mariane
oh
very
well
then
valere
turning
back
but
remember
this
was
you
that
drove
me
to
this
desperate
pass
mariane
of
course
valere
turning
back
again
and
in
the
plan
that
i
have
formed
i
only
follow
your
example
mariane
yes
valere
at
the
door
enough
you
shall
be
punctually
obeyed
mariane
so
much
the
better
valere
coming
back
again
this
is
once
for
all
mariane
so
be
it
then
valere

goes
toward
the
door

as
he
reaches
it

mister
valere
she
goes

of
you
to

each
other
hands
some
time
without
looking
at
each
other
valere
at
last
turning
toward
mariane
come
do
be
so
ungracious
now
about
it
look
at
a
man
as
if
you
did
hate
him
mariane
looks
sideways
toward
valere
with
just
a
bit
of
a
smile
dorine
my
faith
and
troth
what
fools
these
lovers
be
valere
to
mariane
but
come
now

i
not
a
just
complaint
and
truly
are
you
not
a
wicked
creature
to
take
delight
in
saying
what
would
pain
me
mariane
and
are
you
not
yourself
the
most
ungrateful
dorine
leave
this
discussion
till
another
time
now
think
how
you
stave
off
this
plaguy
marriage
mariane
then

to
go
about
it
dorine
well
we
try
all
sorts
of
ways
to
mariane
your
father
daft
to
valere
this
plan
is
nonsense
to
mariane
you
had
better
humour
his
notions
by
a
semblance
of
consent
so
that
in
case
of
danger
you
can
still
find
means
to
block
the
marriage
by
delay
if
you
gain
time
the
rest
is
easy
trust
me
one
day
you
fool
them
with
a
sudden
illness
causing
delay
another
day
ill
omens
you
met
a
funeral
or
broke
a
mirror
or
dreamed
of
muddy
water
best
of
all
they
can
not
marry
you
to
anyone
without
your
saying
yes

makes
a
point
of
heeding
all

i
suspect
that
he
is
fond
of

only
one
thing
to
say

begs
the

my
prayers
i
fear
have
not
sufficient
merit
to
have
drawn
down
this
favour
from
on
high
but
each
entreaty
that
i
made
to
heaven
had
for
its
object
your
recovery
elmire
you
too
solicitous
on
my
behalf
tartuffe
we
could
not
cherish
your
dear
health
too
much
i
would
have
given
mine
to
help
restore
it
elmire
that
pushing
christian
charity
too
far
i
owe
you
many
thanks
for
so
much
kindness
tartuffe
i
do
far
less
for
you
than
you
deserve
elmire
there
is
a
matter
that
i
wished
to
speak
of
in
private
i
am
glad
there
no
one
here
to
listen
tartuffe
madam
i
am
overjoyed
is
sweet
to
find
myself
alone
with
you
this
is
an
opportunity
i
asked
of
heaven
many
a
time
till
now
in
vain
elmire
all
that
i
wish
is
just
a
word
from
you
quite
frank
and
open
hiding
nothing
from
me
damis
without
their
seeing
him
opens
the
closet
door
halfway
tartuffe
i
too
could
wish
as
heaven
especial
favour
to
lay
my
soul
quite
open
to
your
eyes
and
swear
to
you
the
trouble
that
i
made
about
those
visits
which
your
charms
attract
does
not
result
from
any
hatred
toward
you
but
rather
from
a
passionate
devotion
and
purest
motives
elmire
that
is
how
i
take
it
i
think
is
my
salvation
that
concerns
you
tartuffe
pressing
her
finger
tips
madam
is
so
and
such
is
my
devotion
elmire
ouch
but
you
squeeze
too
hard
tartuffe
excess
of
zeal
in
no
way
could
i
ever
mean
to
hurt
you
and
i
as
soon
he
puts
his
hand
on
her
knee
elmire
what
your
hand
doing
there
tartuffe
feeling
your
gown
the
stuff
is
very
soft
elmire
let
be
i
beg
you
i
am
very
ticklish
she
moves
her
chair
away
and
tartuffe
brings
his
nearer
tartuffe
handling
the
lace
yoke
of
elmire
dress
dear
me
how
wonderful
in
workmanship
this
lace
is
they
do
marvels
nowadays
things
of
all
kinds
were
never
better
made
elmire
yes
very
true
but
let
us
come
to
business
they
say
my
husband
means
to
break
his
word
and
marry
mariane
to
you
so
tartuffe
he
did
hint
some
such
thing
but
truly
madam
that
not
the
happiness
i
yearning
after
i
see
elsewhere
the
sweet
compelling
charms
of
such
a
joy
as
fills
my
every
wish
elmire
you
mean
you
can
not
love
terrestrial
things
tartuffe
the
heart
within
my
bosom
is
not
stone
elmire
i
well
believe
your
sighs
all
tend
to
heaven
and
nothing
here
below
can
stay
your
thoughts
tartuffe
love
for
the
beauty
of
eternal
things
can
not
destroy
our
love
for
earthly
beauty
our
mortal
senses
well
may
be
entranced
by
perfect
works
that
heaven
has
fashioned
here
its
charms
reflected
shine
in
such
as
you
and
in
yourself
its
rarest
miracles
it
has
displayed
such
marvels
in
your
face
that
eyes
are
dazed
and
hearts
are
rapt
away
i
could
not
look
on
you
the
perfect
creature
without
admiring
nature
great
creator
and
feeling
all
my
heart
inflamed
with
love
for
you
his
fairest
image
of
himself
at
first
i
trembled
lest
this
secret
love
might
be
the
evil
spirit
artful
snare
i
even
schooled
my
heart
to
flee
your
beauty
thinking
it
was
a
bar
to
my
salvation
but
soon
enlightened
o
all
lovely
one
i
saw
how
this
my
passion
may
be
blameless
how
i
may
make
it
fit
with
modesty
and
thus
completely
yield
my
heart
to
it
is
i
must
own
a
great
presumption
in
me
to
dare
make
you
the
offer
of
my
heart
my
love
hopes
all
things
from
your
perfect
goodness
and
nothing
from
my
own
poor
weak
endeavour
you
are
my
hope
my
stay
my
peace
of
heart
on
you
depends
my
torment
or
my
bliss
and
by
your
doom
of
judgment
i
shall
be
blest
if
you
will
or
damned
by
your
decree
elmire
your
declaration
turned
most
gallantly
but
truly
it
is
just
a
bit
surprising
you
should
have
better
armed
your
heart
methinks
and
taken
thought
somewhat
on
such
a
matter
a
pious
man
like
you
known
everywhere
tartuffe
though
pious
i
am
none
the
less
a
man
and
when
a
man
beholds
your
heavenly
charms
the
heart
surrenders
and
can
think
no
more
i
know
such
words
seem
strange
coming
from
me
but
madam
i
no
angel
after
all
if
you
condemn
my
frankly
made
avowal
you
only
have
your
charming
self
to
blame
soon
as
i
saw
your
more
than
human
beauty
you
were
thenceforth
the
sovereign
of
my
soul
sweetness
ineffable
was
in
your
eyes
that
took
by
storm
my
still
resisting
heart
and
conquered
everything
fasts
prayers
and
tears
and
turned
my
worship
wholly
to
yourself
my
looks
my
sighs
have
spoke
a
thousand
times
now
to
express
it
all
my
voice
must
speak
if
but
you
will
look
down
with
gracious
favour
upon
the
sorrows
of
your
worthless
slave
if
in
your
goodness
you
will
give
me
comfort
and
condescend
unto
my
nothingness
i
ever
pay
you
o
sweet
miracle
an
unexampled
worship
and
devotion
then
too
with
me
your
honour
runs
no
risk
with
me
you
need
not
fear
a
public
scandal
these
court
gallants
that
women
are
so
fond
of
are
boastful
of
their
acts
and
vain
in
speech
they
always
brag
in
public
of
their
progress
soon
as
a
favour
granted
they
divulge
it
their
tattling
tongues
if
you
but
trust
to
them
will
foul
the
altar
where
their
hearts
have
worshipped
but
men
like
me
are
so
discreet
in
love
that
you
may
trust
their
lasting
secrecy
the
care
we
take
to
guard
our
own
good
name
may
fully
guarantee
the
one
we
love
so
you
may
find
with
hearts
like
ours
sincere
love
without
scandal
pleasure
without
fear
elmire
i
heard
you
through
your
speech
is
clear
at
least
but
do
you
fear
that
i
may
take
a
fancy
to
tell
my
husband
of
your
gallant
passion
and
that
a
prompt
report
of
this
affair
may
somewhat
change
the
friendship
which
he
bears
you
tartuffe
i
know
that
you
too
good
and
generous
that
you
will
pardon
my
temerity
excuse
upon
the
score
of
human
frailty
the
violence
of
passion
that
offends
you
and
not
forget
when
you
consult
your
mirror
that
i
not
blind
and
man
is
made
of
flesh
elmire
some
women
might
do
otherwise
perhaps
but
i
am
willing
to
employ
discretion
and
not
repeat
the
matter
to
my
husband
but
in
return
i
ask
one
thing
of
you
that
you
urge
forward
frankly
and
sincerely
the
marriage
of
valere
to
mariane
that
you
give
up
the
unjust
influence
by
which
you
hope
to
win
another
rights
and
scene
iv
elmire
damis
tartuffe
damis
coming
out
of
the
where
he
had
been
hiding
no
i
say
this
thing
must
be
made
public
i
was
just
there
and
overheard
it
all
and
heaven
goodness
must
have
brought
me
there
on
purpose
to
confound
this
scoundrel
pride
and
grant
me
means
to
take
a
signal
vengeance
on
his
hypocrisy
and
arrogance
and
undeceive
my
father
showing
up
the
rascal
caught
at
making
love
to
you
elmire
no
no
it
is
enough
if
he
reforms
endeavouring
to
deserve
the
favour
shown
him
and
since
i
promised
do
not
you
belie
me
is
not
my
way
to
make
a
public
scandal
an
honest
wife
will
scorn
to
heed
such
follies
and
never
fret
her
husband
ears
with
them
damis
you
reasons
of
your
own
for
acting
thus
and
i
have
mine
for
doing
otherwise
to
spare
him
now
would
be
a
mockery
his
bigot
pride
has
triumphed
all
too
long
over
my
righteous
anger
and
has
caused
far
too
much
trouble
in
our
family
the
rascal
all
too
long
has
ruled
my
father
and
crossed
my
sister
love
and
mine
as
well
the
traitor
now
must
be
unmasked
before
him
and
providence
has
given
me
means
to
do
it
to
heaven
i
owe
the
opportunity
and
if
i
did
not
use
it
now
i
have
it
i
should
deserve
to
lose
it
once
for
all

no
by
your
leave
i
not
be
counselled
i
overjoyed
you
need
try
to
tell
me
i
must
give
up
the
pleasure
of
revenge
i
make
an
end
of
this
affair
at
once
and
to
content

tartuffe
damis
father
we
news
to
welcome
your
arrival
that
altogether
novel
and
surprising
you
are
well
paid
for
your
caressing
care
and
this
fine
gentleman
rewards
your
love
most
handsomely
with
zeal
that
seeks
no
less
than
your
dishonour
as
has
now
been
proven
i
just
surprised
him
making
to
your
wife
the
shameful
offer
of
a
guilty
love
she
somewhat
over
gentle
and
discreet
insisted
that
the
thing
should
be
concealed
but
i
will
not
condone
such
shamelessness
nor
so
far
wrong
you
as
to
keep
it
secret
elmire
yes
i
believe
a
wife
should
never
trouble
her
husband
peace
of
mind
with
such
vain
gossip
a
woman
honour
does
not
hang
on
telling
it
is
enough
if
she
defend
herself
or
so
i
think
damis
you
not
have
spoken
if
you
would
but
have
heeded
my
advice

it
plainly
would
mortify
me
now
whatever
wrong
they
find
to
charge
me
with
i
not
deny
it
but
guard
against
the
pride
of
believe
their
stories
arm
your
wrath
against
me
and
drive
me
like
a
villain
from
your
house
i
can
not
have

great
a

of

what
i
have
deserved

some

whichever
was
the
original

it
appears
in
none
of

and
moliere
probably
felt
forced
to
change
it
on
account
of
its
too
close
resemblance
to
the
biblical
phrase

could
you
but
know
with
what
distress
i
see
them
try
to
vilify
me
to

i
must
mortify

and
avoid
your

no
you
shall
haunt
her
just
to
spite

my
delight
to
set
them
in
a
rage

be
seen
together
at
all
hours
and
what
is
more
the
better
to

straightway
i
go
and
make
a
deed
of
gift
to
you
drawn
in
due
form
of
all
my
property
a
good
true

my
to

accept
my
offer
will
you
not
tartuffe
heaven
will
be
done
in
everything
orgon
poor

go
make

draw
the
deed
aright

burst
itself

tartuffe
cleante
yes
it
become
the
talk
of
all
the
town
and
make
a
stir
that
scarcely
to
your
credit
and
i
have
met
you
sir
most
opportunely
to
tell
you
in
a
word
my
frank
opinion
not
to
sift
out
this
scandal
to
the
bottom
suppose
the
worst
for
us
suppose
damis
acted
the
traitor
and
accused
you
falsely
should
not
a
christian
pardon
this
offence
and
stifle
in
his
heart
all
wish
for
vengeance
should
you
permit
that
for
your
petty
quarrel
a
son
be
driven
from
his
father
house
i
tell
you
yet
again
and
tell
you
frankly
everyone
high
or
low
is
scandalised
if
you
take
my
advice
you
make
it
up
and
not
push
matters
to
extremities
make
sacrifice
to
god
of
your
resentment
restore
the
son
to
favour
with
his
father
tartuffe
alas
so
far
as
i
concerned
how
gladly
would
i
do
so
i
bear
him
no
ill
will
i
pardon
all
lay
nothing
to
his
charge
and
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
i
might
serve
him
but
heaven
interests
can
not
allow
it
if
he
returns
then
i
must
leave
the
house
after
his
conduct
quite
unparalleled
all
intercourse
between
us
would
bring
scandal
god
knows
what
everyone
first
thought
would
be
they
would
attribute
it
to
merest
scheming
on
my
part
say
that
conscious
of
my
guilt
i
feigned
a
christian
love
for
my
accuser
but
feared
him
in
my
heart
and
hoped
to
win
him
and
underhandedly
secure
his
silence
cleante
you
try
to
put
us
off
with
specious
phrases
but
all
your
arguments
are
too
why
take
upon
yourself
the
cause
of
heaven
does
heaven
need
our
help
to
punish
sinners
leave
to
itself
the
care
of
its
own
vengeance
and
keep
in
mind
the
pardon
it
commands
us
besides
think
somewhat
less
of
men
opinions
when
you
are
following
the
will
of
heaven
shall
petty
fear
of
what
the
world
may
think
prevent
the
doing
of
a
noble
deed
no
let
us
always
do
as
heaven
commands
and
not
perplex
our
brains
with
further
questions
tartuffe
already
i
have
told
you
i
forgive
him
and
that
is
doing
sir
as
heaven
commands
but
after
this
day
scandal
and
affront
heaven
does
not
order
me
to
live
with
him
cleante
and
does
it
order
you
to
lend
your
ear
to
what
mere
whim
suggested
to
his
father
and
to
accept
gift
of
his
estates
on
which
in
justice
you
can
make
no
claim
tartuffe
no
one
who
knows
me
sir
can
have
the
thought
that
i
am
acting
from
a
selfish
motive
the
goods
of
this
world
have
no
charms
for
me
i
am
not
dazzled
by
their
treacherous
glamour
and
if
i
bring
myself
to
take
the
gift
which
he
insists
on
giving
me
i
do
so
to
tell
the
truth
only
because
i
fear
this
whole
estate
may
fall
into
bad
hands
and
those
to
whom
it
comes
may
use
it
ill
and
not
employ
it
as
is
my
design
for
heaven
glory
and
my
neighbours
good
cleante
eh
sir
give
up
these
conscientious
scruples
that
well
may
cause
a
rightful
heir
complaints
do
take
so
much
upon
yourself
but
let
him
possess
what
his
at
his
own
risk
and
peril
consider
it
were
better
he
misused
it
than
you
should
be
accused
of
robbing
him
i
am
astounded
that
unblushingly
you
could
allow
such
offers
to
be
made
tell
me
has
true
religion
any
maxim
that
teaches
us
to
rob
the
lawful
heir
if
heaven
has
made
it
quite
impossible
damis
and
you
should
live
together
here
were
it
not
better
you
should
quietly
and
honourably
withdraw
than
let
the
son
be
driven
out
for
your
sake
dead
against
all
reason
be
giving

will
let

answer

advise
orgon
brother
i
value
your

most
highly
is
well
thought
out
no
better
can
be
had
but
you
allow
me
not
to
follow
it
elmire
to
her
husband
i
ca
find
words
to
cope
with
such
a
case
your
blindness
makes
me
quite
astounded
at
you
you
are
bewitched
with
him
to
disbelieve
the
things
we
tell
you
happened
here
orgon
i
am
your
humble
servant
and
can
see
things
when
they
plain
as
noses
on
folks
faces
i
know
you
partial
to
my
rascal
son
and
did
dare
to
disavow
the
trick
he
tried
to
play
on
this
poor
man
besides
you
were
too
calm
to
be
believed
if
that
had
happened
you
have
been
far
more
disturbed
elmire
and
must
our
honour
always
rush
to
arms
at
the
mere
mention
of
illicit
love
or
can
we
answer
no
attack
upon
it
except
with
blazing
eyes
and
lips
of
scorn
for
my
part
i
just
laugh
away
such
nonsense
i
no
desire
to
make
a
loud
our
virtue
should
i
think
be

can
i
quite
approve

arms
itself
with
teeth

claws
to
tear
men
eyes
out
at
the
slightest
word
heaven
preserve
me
from
that
kind
of
honour
i
like
my
virtue
not
to
be
a
vixen
and
i
believe
a
quiet
cold
rebuff
no
less
effective
to
repulse
a
lover

i
know
and
you
ca
throw
me
off
the
scent
elmire
once
more
i
am
astounded
at
your
weakness

wonder
what
your
unbelief
would
answer

see

orgon
see

all
rubbish

what
a
man
but
answer

i
not
proposing
now
that
you
believe

but
let
suppose
that
here
from
proper
hiding
you
should
be
made
to
see
and
hear
all
plainly
what
would
you
say
then
to
your

orgon
why
then
i
say
say
nothing
it
ca
be
elmire
your
error
has
endured
too
long
already
and
quite
too
long
you
branded
me
a
liar
i
must
at
once
for
my
own
satisfaction
make
you
a
witness
of
the
things
we
told
you
orgon
amen
i
take
you
at
your
word
we
see
what
tricks
you
have
and
how
you
keep
your

perhaps
you

leads
straight

him
come

you
withdraw

oh

either
sees

hears

i
going
a
long
way
to
humour
you
i
must
say
but
i
see
you
through
your

elmire
and
then
you
have
i
think
no
more
to
say
to
her
husband
who
is
now
under
the
table
but
mind
i
going
to
meddle
with
strange
matters
prepare
yourself
to
be
in
no
wise
shocked
whatever
i
may
say
must
pass
because
is
only
to
convince
you
as
i
promised
by
wheedling
speeches
since
i
forced
to
do
it
i
make
this
hypocrite
put
off
his
mask
flatter
the
longings
of
his
shameless
passion
and
give
free
play
to
all
his
impudence
but
since
is
for
your
sake
to
prove
to
you
his
guilt
that
i
shall
feign
to
share
his
love
i
can
leave
off
as
soon
as
you
convinced
and
things
shall
go
no
farther
than
you
choose
so
when
you
think
they
gone
quite
far
enough
it
is
for
you
to
stop
his
mad
pursuit
to
spare
your
wife
and
not
expose
me
farther
than
you
shall
need
yourself
to
undeceive
you
it
is
your
own
affair
and
you
must
end
it
when
here
he
comes
keep
still
do
show
yourself

they
told
me
that
you
wished
to
see
me
here

yes
i
have
secrets
for
your
ear
alone

shut
the

first
and
look
everywhere
for
fear
of
spies
tartuffe
goes
and
closes
the

and
comes

we
surely
ca
afford
another
scene
like
that
we
had
just
now
was
ever
anyone
so
caught
before
damis
did
frighten
me
most
terribly
on
your
account
you
saw
i
did
my
best
to
baffle
his
design
and
calm
his
anger
but
i
was
so
confused
i
never
thought
to
contradict
his
story
still
thank
heaven
things
turned
out
all
the
better
as
it
happened
and
now
we
on
an
even
safer
footing
the
high
esteem
you
held
in
laid
the
storm
my
husband
can
have
no
suspicion
of
you
and
even
insists
to
spite
the
that
we
shall
be
together
constantly
so
that
is
how
without
the
risk
of
blame
i
can
be
here
locked
up
with
you
alone
and
can
reveal
to
you
my
heart
perhaps
only
too
ready
to
allow
your
passion
tartuffe
your
words
are
somewhat
hard
to
understand
madam
just
now
you
used
a
different
style
elmire
if
that
refusal
has
offended
you
how
little
do
you
know
a
woman
heart
how
ill
you
guess
what
it
would
have
you
know
when
it
presents
so
feeble
a
defence
always
at
first
our
modesty
resists
the
tender
feelings
you
inspire
us
with
whatever
cause
we
find
to
justify
the
love
that
masters
us
we
still
must
feel
some
little
shame
in
owning
it
and
strive
to
make
as
though
we
would
not
when
we
would
but
from
the
very
way
we
go
about
it
we
let
a
lover
know
our
heart
surrenders
the
while
our
lips
for
honour
sake
oppose
our
heart
desire
and
in
refusing
promise
i
telling
you
my
secret
all
too
freely
and
with
too
little
heed
to
modesty
but
now
that
i
made
bold
to
speak
pray
tell
me
should
i
have
tried
to
keep
damis
from
speaking
should
i
have
heard
the
offer
of
your
heart
so
quietly
and
suffered
all
your
pleading
and
taken
it
just
as
i
did
remember
if
such
a
declaration
had
not
pleased
me
and
when
i
tried
my
utmost
to
persuade
you
not
to
accept
the
marriage
that
was
talked
of
what
should
my
earnestness
have
hinted
to
you
if
not
the
interest
that
you
inspired
and
my
chagrin
should
such
a
match
compel
me
to
share
a
heart
i
want
all
to
myself
tartuffe
is
past
a
doubt
the
height
of
happiness
to
hear
such
words
from
lips
we
dote
upon
their
honeyed
sweetness
pours
through
all
my
senses
long
draughts
of
suavity
ineffable
my
heart
employs
its
utmost
zeal
to
please
you
and
counts
your
love
its
one
beatitude
and
yet
that
heart
must
beg
that
you
allow
it
to
doubt
a
little
its
felicity
i
well
might
think
these
words
an
honest
trick
to
make
me
break
off
this
approaching
marriage
and
if
i
may
express
myself
quite
plainly
i
can
not
trust
these
too
enchanting
words
until
the
granting
of
some
little
favour
i
sigh
for
shall
assure
me
of
their
truth
and
build
within
my
soul
on
firm
foundations
a
lasting
faith
in
your
sweet
charity

draw
her
husband
attention
what
must
you
go
so
fast
and
all
at

exhaust
the
whole
love
of
a
woman
heart
she
does
herself
the
violence
to
make
this
dear
confession
of
her
love
and
you
are
not

satisfied

will
not

utmost

tartuffe
the
less
a
blessing
is
deserved
the
less
we
dare
to
hope
for
it
and
words
alone
can
ill
assuage
our
love
desires
a
fate
too
full
of
happiness
seems
doubtful
still
we
must
enjoy
it
ere
we
can
believe
it
and
i
who
know
how
little
i
deserve
your
goodness
doubt
the
fortunes
of
my
daring
so
i
shall
trust
to
nothing
madam
till
you
have
convinced
my
love
by
something
real
elmire
ah
how
your
love
enacts
the
tyrant
role
and
throws
my
mind
into
a
strange
confusion
with
what
fierce
sway
it
rules
a
conquered
heart
and
violently
will
have
its
wishes
granted
what
is
there
no
escape
from
your
pursuit
no
respite
even
not
a
breathing
space
nay
is
it
decent
to
be
so
exacting
and
so
abuse
by
urgency
the
weakness
you
may
discover
in
a
woman
heart
tartuffe
but
if
my
worship
wins
your
gracious
favour
then
why
refuse
me
some
sure
proof
thereof
elmire
but
how
can
i
consent
to
what
you
wish
without
offending
heaven
you
talk
so
much
of
tartuffe
if
heaven
is
all
that
stands
now
in
my

i
easily
remove
that
little
hindrance
your
heart
need
not
hold
back
for
such
a
trifle

but
they
affright
us
so
with
heaven

tartuffe
i
can
dispel
these
foolish
fears
dear
madam
i
know
the
art
of
pacifying
scruples
heaven
forbids
is
true
some
satisfactions
but
we
find
means
to
make
things
right
with

scoundrel

according

our
various
occasions
and
rectify
the
evil
of
the

according

our

i
duly
teach
you
all
these

madam
you
only
need
to
let

be
guided
content
my

have
no

at

your

is
very
bad

yes
i
in

tartuffe
would
you
accept
this
bit
of
licorice
elmire
the
case
is
obstinate
i
find
and
all
the
licorice
in
the
world
will
do
no

tartuffe
is
very
trying
elmire
more
than
words
can
say
tartuffe
in
any

your
scruple
easily
removed
with
me
you
sure
of
secrecy
and
there
no
harm
unless
a
thing
is
known
the
public
scandal
is
what
brings
offence
and
secret
sinning
is
not
sin
at
all
elmire
after
coughing
again
so
then
i
see
i
must
resolve
to
yield
i
must
consent
to
grant
you
everything
and
can
not
hope
to
give
full
satisfaction
or
win
full
confidence
at
lesser
cost
no
doubt
is
very
hard
to
come
to
this
is
quite
against
my
will
i
go
so
far
but
since
i
must
be
forced
to
it
since
nothing
that
can
be
said
suffices
for
belief
since
more
convincing
proof
is
still
demanded
i
must
make
up
my
mind
to
humour
people
if
my
consent
give
reason
for
offence
so
much
the
worse
for
him
who
forced
me
to

the

can
surely
not

can

done
to
meet

orgon
i
all
worked
up
about
that
wretched
box
more
than

else
it
drives
me
to

cleante
that
box
must
hide
some
mighty
mystery
orgon
argas
my
friend
who
is
in
trouble
brought
it
himself
most
secretly
and
left
it
with
me
he
chose
me
in
his
exile
for
this
trust
and
on
these
documents
from
what
he
said
i
judge
his
life
and
property
depend
cleante
how
could
you
trust
them
to
another
hands
orgon
by
reason
of
a
conscientious
scruple
i
went
straight
to
my
traitor
to
confide
in
him
his
sophistry
made
me
believe
that
i
must
give
the
box
to
him
to
keep
so
that
in
case
of
search
i
might
deny
my
having
it
at
all
and
still
by
favour
of
this
evasion
keep
my
conscience
clear
even
in
taking
oath
against
the
truth
cleante
your
case
is
bad
so
far
as
i
can
see
this
deed
of
gift
this
trusting
of
the
secret
to
him
were
both
to
state
my
frank
opinion
steps
that
you
took
too
lightly
he
can
lead
you
to
any
length
with
these
for
hostages
and
since
he
holds
you
at
such
disadvantage
you
be
still
more
imprudent
to
provoke
him
so
you
must
go
some
gentler
way
about
orgon
what
can
a
soul
so
base
a
heart
so
false
hide
neath
the
semblance

such

fervour

more
pious
folk
for
me
i
shall
abhor
them
utterly
forever
and
henceforth
treat
them
worse
than
any

there
you
go
again
quite
off
the
handle
in
nothing
do
you
keep
an
even
temper
you
never
know
what
reason
is
but
always
jump
first
to
one
extreme
and
then
the
other
you
see
your
error
and
you
recognise
that
you
been
cozened
by
a
feigned
zeal
but
to
make
up
in
the
name
of

why
should
you
plunge
into
a
worse
mistake
and
find
no
difference
in
character
between
a
worthless
scamp
and
all
good
people
what
just
because
a

boldly
duped
you

must
you

everybody

no

nowadays
leave

try
to
keep
in

yes
i
too
long
delayed
its
execution
is
very
fitting
you

therefore
you

our

is
not

to

dealing
his
eyes
can
read
men
inmost
hearts
and
all
the
art
of
hypocrites
can
not
deceive
him
his
sharp
discernment
sees

clear

true
his
mind
can
not
too
easily
be
swayed
for
reason
always
holds
the
balance
even
he
honours
and
exalts
true
piety
but
knows
the
false
and
views
it
with
disgust
this
fellow
was
by
no

apt
to
fool
him
far
subtler
snares
have
failed
against
his
wisdom
and
his
quick
insight
pierced
immediately
the
hidden
baseness
of
this
tortuous
heart
accusing
you
the
knave
betrayed
himself
and
by
true
recompense
of
heaven
justice
he
stood
revealed
before
our

eyes
a
scoundrel
known
before
by
other

whose
horrid
crimes
detailed
at

might
fill
a

of
many
volumes
our
monarch
to
resolve
you
in
a
word
detesting
his
ingratitude
and
baseness
added
this
horror
to
his
other
crimes
and
sent
me
hither
under
his
direction
to
see
his
insolence
itself
and
force
him
then
to
give
you
satisfaction
your

which
the

says

i
am
to
take

transferring

our

sovereign
will
makes

for
the

your

involved
you

pardons
you
thus
he
rewards
your
recent
zeal
displayed
in
helping

maintain
his

and
shows
how
well
his

when
