chapter
i
some
opinions
and
a
wedding
i
bertram
take
thee
billy
chanted
the
clergyman
bertram
take
thee
billy
echoed
the
tall
young
bridegroom
his
eyes
gravely
tender
to
my
wedded
my
wedded
wife
the
bridegroom
voice
shook
a
little
to
have
and
to
hold
from
this
day
have
and
to
hold
from
this
day
forward
now
the
young
voice
rang
with
triumph
it
had
grown
strong
and
steady
for
better
for
better
for
worse
for
richer
for
poorer
droned
the
clergyman
with
the
weariness
of
uncounted
repetitions
richer
for
poorer
avowed
the
bridegroom
with
the
decisive
emphasis
of
one
to
whom
the
words
are
new
and
significant
in
sickness
and
in
sickness
and
in
health
to
love
and
to
love
and
to
cherish
the
younger
voice
carried
infinite
tenderness
now
till
death
us
do
death
us
do
part
repeated
the
bridegroom
lips
but
everybody
knew
that
what
his
heart
said
was
now
and
through
all
according
to
god
holy
to
god
holy
ordinance
and
thereto
i
plight
thee
my
thereto
i
plight
thee
my
troth
there
was
a
faint
stir
in
the
room
in
one
corner
a
woman
blinked
eyes
and
pulled
a
fleecy
white
shawl
more
closely
about
her
shoulders
then
the
minister
voice
sounded
again
i
billy
take
thee
billy
take
thee
bertram
this
time
the
echoing
voice
was
a
feminine
one
low
and
sweet
but
clearly
distinct
and
vibrant
with
joyous
confidence
on
through
one
after
another
of
the
ever
familiar
but
ever
impressive
phrases
of
the
service
that
gives
into
the
hands
of
one
man
and
of
one
woman
the
future
happiness
each
of
the
other
the
wedding
was
at
noon
that
evening
kate
hartwell
sister
of
the
bridegroom
wrote
the
following
letter
boston
july
my
dear
husband
well
it
all
over
with
and
they
married
i
could
do
one
thing
to
prevent
it
much
as
ever
as
they
would
even
listen
to
what
i
had
to
say
and
when
they
knew
how
i
had
hurried
east
to
say
it
too
with
only
two
hours
notice
but
then
what
can
you
expect
from
time
immemorial
lovers
never
did
have
any
sense
and
when
those
lovers
are
such
irresponsible
flutterbudgets
as
billy
and
bertram
and
such
a
wedding
i
could
do
anything
with
either
though
i
tried
hard
they
had
it
in
billy
at
noon
with
nothing
but
the
sun
for
light
there
was
no
maid
of
honor
no
bridesmaids
no
wedding
cake
no
wedding
veil
no
presents
except
from
the
family
and
from
that
ridiculous
chinese
cook
of
brother
william
ding
dong
or
whatever
his
name
is
he
tore
in
just
before
the
wedding
ceremony
and
insisted
upon
seeing
billy
to
give
her
a
wretched
little
green
stone
idol
which
he
declared
would
bring
her
plenty
velly
good
if
she
received
it
before
she
married
i
would
have
the
hideous
grinning
thing
around
but
william
says
it
real
jade
and
very
valuable
and
of
course
billy
was
crazy
over
it
or
pretended
to
be
there
was
no
trousseau
either
and
no
reception
there
was
no
anything
but
the
bridegroom
and
when
i
tell
you
that
billy
actually
declared
that
was
all
she
wanted
you
will
understand
how
absurdly
in
love
she
is
in
spite
of
all
those
weeks
and
weeks
of
broken
engagement
when
i
at
least
supposed
she
had
come
to
her
senses
until
i
got
that
crazy
note
from
bertram
a
week
ago
saying
they
were
to
be
married
today
i
ca
say
that
i
got
any
really
satisfactory
explanation
of
the
matter
everything
has
been
in
such
a
hubbub
and
those
two
ridiculous
children
have
been
so
afraid
they
would
be
together
every
minute
possible
that
any
really
rational
conversation
with
either
of
them
was
out
of
the
question
when
billy
broke
the
engagement
last
spring
none
of
us
knew
why
she
had
done
it
as
you
know
and
i
fancy
we
shall
be
almost
as
much
in
the
dark
as
to
why
she
has
er
mended
it
now
as
you
might
say
as
near
as
i
can
make
out
however
she
thought
he
did
want
her
and
he
thought
she
did
want
him
i
believe
matters
were
still
further
complicated
by
a
girl
bertram
was
painting
and
a
young
fellow
that
used
to
sing
with
billy
a
arkwright
anyhow
things
came
to
a
head
last
spring
billy
broke
the
engagement
and
fled
to
parts
unknown
with
aunt
hannah
leaving
bertram
here
in
boston
to
alternate
between
stony
despair
and
reckless
gayety
according
to
william
and
it
was
while
he
was
in
the
latter
mood
that
he
had
that
awful
automobile
accident
and
broke
his
arm
and
almost
his
neck
he
was
wildly
delirious
and
called
continually
for
billy
well
it
seems
billy
did
know
all
this
but
a
week
ago
she
came
home
and
in
some
way
found
out
about
it
i
think
through
pete
william
old
butler
you
know
just
exactly
what
happened
i
ca
say
but
i
do
know
that
she
dragged
poor
old
aunt
hannah
down
to
bertram
at
some
unearthly
hour
and
in
the
rain
and
aunt
hannah
could
do
a
thing
with
her
all
billy
would
say
was
wants
me
and
aunt
hannah
told
me
that
if
i
could
have
seen
billy
face
have
known
that
she
have
gone
to
bertram
then
if
he
been
at
the
top
of
the
himalaya
mountains
or
at
the
bottom
of
the
china
sea
so
perhaps
it
just
as
well
for
aunt
hannah
sake
at
least
that
he
was
in
no
worse
place
than
on
his
own
couch
at
home
anyhow
she
went
and
in
half
an
hour
they
blandly
informed
aunt
hannah
that
they
were
going
to
be
married
aunt
hannah
said
she
tried
to
stop
that
and
get
them
to
put
it
off
till
october
the
original
date
you
know
but
bertram
was
obdurate
and
when
he
declared
he
marry
her
the
next
day
if
it
was
for
the
new
license
law
aunt
hannah
said
she
gave
up
for
fear
he
get
a
special
dispensation
or
go
to
the
governor
or
the
president
or
do
some
other
dreadful
thing
what
a
funny
old
soul
aunt
hannah
is
bertram
told
that
he
should
never
feel
safe
till
billy
was
really
his
that
she
read
something
or
hear
something
or
think
something
or
get
a
letter
from
me
as
if
anything
could
say
would
do
any
harm
and
so
break
the
engagement
again
well
she
his
now
so
i
suppose
he
satisfied
though
for
my
part
i
have
changed
my
mind
at
all
i
still
say
that
they
are
not
one
bit
suited
to
each
other
and
that
matrimony
will
simply
ruin
his
career
bertram
never
has
loved
and
never
will
love
any
girl
long
except
to
paint
but
if
he
simply
get
married
why
could
he
have
taken
a
nice
sensible
domestic
girl
that
would
have
kept
him
fed
and
mended
not
but
that
i
very
fond
of
billy
as
you
know
dear
but
imagine
billy
as
a
wife
worse
yet
a
mother
billy
a
dear
girl
but
she
knows
about
as
much
of
real
life
and
its
problems
as
as
our
little
kate
a
more
impulsive
irresponsible
young
woman
i
never
saw
she
can
play
divinely
and
write
delightful
songs
acknowledge
but
what
is
that
when
a
man
is
hungry
or
has
lost
a
button
billy
has
had
her
own
way
and
had
everything
she
wanted
for
years
now
a
rather
dangerous
preparation
for
marriage
especially
marriage
to
a
fellow
like
bertram
who
has
had
own
way
and
everything
wanted
for
years
pray
what
going
to
happen
when
those
ways
conflict
and
neither
one
gets
the
thing
wanted
and
think
of
her
ignorance
of
cooking
but
there
what
the
use
they
married
now
and
it
ca
be
helped
mercy
what
a
letter
i
written
but
i
had
to
talk
to
some
one
besides
i
promised
i
to
let
you
know
how
matters
stood
as
soon
as
i
could
as
you
see
though
my
trip
east
has
been
practically
useless
i
saw
the
wedding
to
be
sure
but
i
did
prevent
it
or
even
postpone
it
though
i
meant
to
do
one
or
the
other
else
i
should
never
have
made
that
tiresome
journey
half
across
the
continent
at
two
hours
notice
however
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
as
for
me
i
dead
tired
good
night
affectionately
yours
quite
naturally
kate
hartwell
was
not
the
only
one
who
was
thinking
that
evening
of
the
wedding
in
the
home
of
bertram
brother
cyril
cyril
himself
was
at
the
piano
but
where
his
thoughts
were
was
plain
to
be
seen
or
rather
heard
for
from
under
his
fingers
there
came
the
lohengrin
wedding
march
until
all
the
room
seemed
filled
with
the
scent
of
orange
blossoms
the
mistiness
of
floating
veils
and
the
echoing
peals
of
organs
heralding
the
fair
bride
and
over
by
the
table
in
the
glowing
circle
of
the
shaded
lamp
sat
marie
cyril
wife
a
dainty
by
her
side
her
hands
however
lay
idly
across
the
stocking
in
her
lap
as
the
music
ceased
she
drew
a
long
sigh
what
a
perfectly
beautiful
wedding
that
was
she
breathed
cyril
whirled
about
on
the
piano
stool
it
was
a
very
sensible
wedding
he
said
with
emphasis
they
looked
so
happy
both
of
them
went
on
marie
dreamily
so
so
sort
of
above
and
beyond
everything
about
them
as
if
nothing
ever
ever
could
trouble
them
cyril
lifted
his
eyebrows
humph
well
as
i
said
before
it
was
a
very
wedding
he
declared
this
time
marie
noticed
the
emphasis
she
laughed
though
her
eyes
looked
a
little
troubled
i
know
dear
of
course
what
you
mean
thought
our
wedding
was
beautiful
but
i
would
have
made
it
simpler
if
i
realized
in
time
how
you
you
how
i
abhorred
pink
teas
and
purple
pageants
he
finished
for
her
with
a
frowning
smile
oh
well
i
stood
it
for
the
sake
of
what
it
brought
his
face
showed
now
only
the
smile
the
frown
had
vanished
for
a
man
known
for
years
to
his
friends
as
a
hater
of
women
and
all
other
confusion
cyril
henshaw
was
looking
remarkably
with
himself
his
wife
of
less
than
a
year
colored
as
she
met
his
gaze
hurriedly
she
picked
up
her
needle
the
man
laughed
happily
at
her
confusion
what
are
you
doing
is
that
my
stocking
he
demanded
a
look
half
pain
half
reproach
crossed
her
face
why
cyril
of
course
not
you
you
told
me
not
to
long
ago
you
said
my
darns
made
bunches
ho
i
meant
i
did
want
to
them
retorted
the
man
upon
whom
the
tragic
wretchedness
of
that
bunches
had
been
quite
lost
i
love
to
see
you
them
he
finished
with
an
approving
glance
at
the
pretty
little
picture
of
domesticity
before
him
a
peculiar
expression
came
to
marie
eyes
why
cyril
you
mean
you
to
have
me
mend
them
just
for
for
the
sake
of
seeing
me
do
it
when
you
you
wo
ever
wear
them
sure
nodded
the
man
imperturbably
then
with
a
sudden
laugh
he
asked
i
wonder
now
does
billy
love
to
mend
socks
marie
smiled
but
she
sighed
too
and
shook
her
head
i
afraid
not
nor
cook
marie
laughed
outright
this
time
the
vaguely
troubled
look
had
fled
from
her
eyes
oh
billy
helped
me
beat
eggs
and
butter
sometimes
but
i
never
knew
her
to
cook
a
thing
or
want
to
cook
a
thing
but
once
then
she
spent
nearly
two
weeks
trying
to
learn
to
make
puddings
for
for
marie
puckered
her
lips
queerly
well
i
supposed
they
were
for
you
at
the
time
at
all
events
she
was
trying
to
make
them
for
some
one
of
you
boys
probably
it
was
really
for
bertram
humph
grunted
cyril
then
after
a
minute
he
observed
i
judge
kate
thinks
billy
never
make
them
for
anybody
i
afraid
sister
kate
is
oh
but
hartwell
was
was
disappointed
in
the
wedding
apologized
marie
quickly
you
know
she
wanted
it
put
off
anyway
and
she
like
such
a
simple
one
as
usual
sister
kate
forgot
it
was
her
funeral
i
mean
her
wedding
retorted
cyril
dryly
kate
is
never
happy
you
know
unless
she
managing
yes
i
know
nodded
marie
with
a
frowning
smile
of
recollection
at
certain
features
of
her
own
wedding
she
does
approve
of
billy
taste
in
guests
either
remarked
cyril
after
a
moment
silence
i
thought
her
guests
were
lovely
spoke
up
marie
in
quick
defense
of
course
most
of
her
social
friends
are
away
in
july
but
billy
is
never
a
society
girl
you
know
in
spite
of
the
way
society
is
always
trying
to
lionize
her
and
oh
of
course
kate
knows
that
but
she
says
it
seems
as
if
billy
need
have
gone
out
and
gathered
in
the
lame
and
the
halt
and
the
nonsense
cried
marie
with
unusual
sharpness
for
her
i
suppose
she
said
that
just
because
of
greggory
and
tommy
dunn
well
they
did
make
a
real
wedding
party
you
must
admit
laughed
cyril
what
with
the
bridegroom
own
arm
in
a
sling
too
but
who
were
they
all
anyway
why
you
knew
greggory
and
alice
of
course
and
pete
smiled
marie
and
was
pete
happy
billy
says
she
have
had
pete
if
she
had
no
one
else
that
there
would
have
been
any
wedding
anyway
if
it
had
been
for
his
telephoning
aunt
hannah
that
yes
will
told
as
for
tommy
and
the
others
most
of
them
were
those
people
that
billy
had
at
her
home
last
summer
for
a
two
weeks
vacation
people
you
know
too
poor
to
give
themselves
one
and
too
proud
to
accept
one
from
ordinary
charity
billy
been
following
them
up
and
doing
little
things
for
them
ever
since
sugarplums
and
frosting
on
their
cake
she
calls
it
and
they
adore
her
of
course
i
think
it
was
lovely
of
her
to
have
them
and
they
did
have
such
a
good
time
you
should
have
seen
tommy
when
you
played
that
wedding
march
for
billy
to
enter
the
room
his
poor
little
face
was
so
transfigured
with
joy
that
i
almost
cried
just
to
look
at
him
billy
says
he
loves
music
poor
little
fellow
well
i
hope
they
be
happy
in
spite
of
kate
doleful
prophecies
certainly
they
looked
happy
enough
declared
cyril
patting
a
yawn
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
i
fancy
will
and
aunt
hannah
are
lonesome
though
about
now
he
added
yes
smiled
marie
mistily
as
she
gathered
up
her
work
i
know
what
aunt
hannah
doing
she
helping
rosa
put
the
house
to
rights
and
she
stopping
to
cry
over
every
slipper
and
handkerchief
of
billy
she
finds
and
she
do
that
until
that
funny
clock
of
hers
strikes
twelve
then
she
say
my
grief
and
conscience
midnight
but
the
next
minute
she
remember
that
it
only
eleven
after
all
and
she
send
rosa
to
bed
and
sit
patting
billy
slipper
in
her
lap
till
it
really
is
midnight
by
all
the
other
cyril
laughed
appreciatively
well
i
know
what
will
is
doing
he
declared
will
is
in
bertram
den
dozing
before
the
fireplace
with
spunkie
curled
up
in
his
as
it
happened
both
these
surmises
were
not
far
from
right
in
the
strata
the
henshaws
old
beacon
street
home
william
was
sitting
before
the
fireplace
with
the
cat
in
his
lap
but
he
was
not
dozing
he
was
talking
spunkie
he
was
saying
your
master
bertram
got
married
and
to
miss
billy
he
be
bringing
her
home
one
of
these
days
your
new
mistress
and
such
a
mistress
never
did
cat
or
house
have
a
better
just
think
for
the
first
time
in
years
this
old
place
is
to
know
the
touch
of
a
woman
hand
and
that
what
it
has
known
for
almost
twenty
years
except
for
those
few
short
months
six
years
ago
when
a
girl
and
a
little
gray
kitten
that
was
spunk
your
predecessor
you
know
blew
in
and
blew
out
again
before
we
scarcely
knew
they
were
here
that
girl
was
miss
billy
and
she
was
a
dear
then
just
as
she
is
now
only
now
she
coming
here
to
stay
she
coming
home
spunkie
and
she
make
it
a
home
for
you
for
me
and
for
all
of
us
up
to
now
you
know
it
has
really
been
a
home
for
years
just
us
men
so
it
be
very
different
spunkie
as
you
soon
find
out
now
mind
madam
we
must
show
that
we
appreciate
all
this
no
tempers
no
tantrums
no
showing
of
claws
no
leaving
our
coats
either
yours
or
mine
on
the
chairs
no
tracking
in
of
mud
on
clean
rugs
and
floors
for
we
going
to
have
a
home
spunkie
a
home
at
hillside
aunt
hannah
was
indeed
helping
rosa
to
put
the
house
to
rights
as
marie
had
said
she
was
crying
too
over
a
glove
she
had
found
on
billy
piano
but
she
was
crying
over
something
else
also
not
only
had
she
lost
billy
but
she
had
lost
her
home
to
be
sure
nothing
had
been
said
during
that
nightmare
of
a
week
of
hurry
and
confusion
about
aunt
hannah
future
but
aunt
hannah
knew
very
well
how
it
must
be
this
dear
little
house
on
the
side
of
corey
hill
was
billy
home
and
billy
would
not
need
it
any
longer
it
would
be
sold
of
course
and
she
aunt
hannah
would
go
back
to
a
front
and
loneliness
in
some
back
bay
and
a
second
story
front
and
loneliness
would
not
be
easy
now
after
these
years
of
home
and
billy
no
wonder
indeed
that
aunt
hannah
sat
crying
and
patting
the
little
white
glove
in
her
hand
no
wonder
too
that
being
aunt
hannah
she
reached
for
the
shawl
near
by
and
put
it
on
shiveringly
even
july
was
cold
to
aunt
hannah
in
yet
another
home
that
evening
was
the
wedding
of
billy
neilson
and
bertram
henshaw
uppermost
in
thought
and
speech
in
a
certain
little
flat
where
in
two
rented
rooms
lived
alice
greggory
and
her
crippled
mother
alice
was
talking
to
arkwright
commonly
known
to
his
friends
as
mary
jane
owing
to
the
mystery
in
which
he
had
for
so
long
shrouded
his
name
arkwright
was
plainly
moody
and
ill
at
ease
you
not
listening
you
not
listening
at
all
complained
alice
greggory
at
last
reproachfully
with
a
visible
effort
the
man
roused
himself
indeed
i
am
he
maintained
i
thought
you
be
interested
in
the
wedding
you
used
to
be
friends
you
and
the
girl
voice
still
vibrated
with
reproach
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
a
little
harshly
the
man
said
perhaps
because
i
wanted
to
be
more
than
a
friend
is
why
you
not
satisfied
with
my
interest
a
look
that
was
almost
terror
came
to
alice
greggory
eyes
she
flushed
painfully
then
grew
very
white
you
mean
yes
he
nodded
dully
without
looking
up
i
cared
too
much
for
her
i
supposed
henshaw
was
just
a
friend
till
too
there
was
a
breathless
hush
before
a
little
unsteadily
the
girl
stammered
oh
i
so
sorry
so
very
sorry
i
i
did
no
of
course
you
did
i
almost
told
you
though
lots
of
times
you
been
so
good
to
me
all
these
he
raised
his
head
now
and
looked
at
her
frank
comradeship
in
his
eyes
the
girl
stirred
restlessly
her
eyes
swerved
a
little
under
his
level
gaze
oh
but
i
done
nothing
she
stammered
then
at
the
light
tap
of
crutches
on
a
bare
floor
she
turned
in
obvious
relief
oh
here
mother
she
been
in
visiting
with
delano
our
landlady
mother
arkwright
is
meanwhile
speeding
north
as
fast
as
steam
could
carry
them
were
the
bride
and
groom
the
wondrousness
of
the
first
hour
of
their
journey
side
by
side
had
become
a
joyous
certitude
that
always
it
was
to
be
like
this
now
bertram
began
the
bride
after
a
long
minute
of
eloquent
silence
yes
you
know
our
wedding
was
very
different
from
most
of
course
it
was
yes
but
it
was
now
the
bride
voice
grew
tenderly
earnest
i
think
our
marriage
is
going
to
be
different
different
billy
tone
was
emphatic
there
are
so
many
common
everyday
marriages
where
where
why
bertram
as
if
you
could
ever
be
to
me
like
like
carleton
is
for
instance
like
carleton
is
to
you
bertram
voice
was
frankly
puzzled
no
no
as
carleton
is
to
carleton
i
oh
bertram
subsided
in
relief
and
the
grahams
and
whartons
and
the
freddie
agnews
and
and
a
lot
of
others
why
bertram
i
seen
the
grahams
and
the
whartons
not
even
speak
to
each
other
a
whole
evening
when
they
been
at
a
dinner
or
something
and
i
seen
carleton
not
even
seem
to
know
her
husband
came
into
the
room
i
do
mean
quarrel
dear
of
course
we
never
but
i
mean
i
sure
we
shall
never
get
used
to
to
you
being
you
and
i
being
indeed
we
agreed
bertram
rapturously
ours
is
going
to
be
such
a
beautiful
marriage
of
course
it
will
and
we
be
so
happy
i
shall
be
and
i
shall
try
to
make
you
as
if
i
could
be
anything
else
sighed
billy
blissfully
and
now
we
have
any
misunderstandings
you
of
course
not
er
what
that
why
i
mean
that
that
we
ca
ever
repeat
hose
miserable
weeks
of
misunderstanding
everything
is
all
explained
up
i
now
that
you
do
love
miss
winthrop
or
just
girls
any
girl
to
paint
you
love
me
not
the
tilt
of
my
chin
nor
the
turn
of
my
head
but
i
do
just
bertram
eyes
gave
the
caress
his
lips
would
have
given
had
it
not
been
for
the
presence
of
the
man
in
the
seat
across
the
aisle
of
the
and
you
you
know
now
that
i
love
you
just
you
not
even
arkwright
not
even
arkwright
smiled
billy
there
was
the
briefest
of
hesitations
then
a
little
constrainedly
bertram
asked
and
you
said
you
you
never
cared
for
arkwright
did
you
for
the
second
time
in
her
life
billy
was
thankful
that
question
had
turned
upon
love
for
arkwright
not
arkwright
love
for
her
in
billy
opinion
a
man
unrequited
love
for
a
girl
was
his
secret
not
hers
and
was
certainly
one
that
the
girl
had
no
right
to
tell
once
before
bertram
had
asked
her
if
she
had
ever
cared
for
arkwright
and
then
she
had
answered
emphatically
as
she
did
now
never
i
thought
you
said
so
murmured
bertram
relaxing
a
little
i
did
besides
did
i
tell
you
she
went
on
airily
i
think
marry
alice
greggory
alice
wrote
me
all
the
time
i
was
away
and
oh
she
did
say
anything
definite
i
admit
confessed
billy
with
an
arch
smile
but
she
spoke
of
his
being
there
lots
and
they
used
to
know
each
other
years
ago
you
see
there
was
almost
a
romance
there
i
think
before
the
greggorys
lost
their
money
and
moved
away
from
all
their
well
he
may
have
her
she
a
nice
girl
a
mighty
nice
girl
answered
bertram
with
the
unmistakably
satisfied
air
of
the
man
who
knows
he
himself
possesses
the
nicest
girl
of
them
all
billy
reading
unerringly
the
triumph
in
his
voice
grew
suddenly
grave
she
regarded
her
husband
with
a
thoughtful
frown
then
she
drew
a
profound
sigh
whew
laughed
bertram
whimsically
so
soon
as
this
bertram
billy
voice
was
tragic
yes
my
the
bridegroom
pulled
his
face
into
sobriety
then
billy
spoke
with
solemn
impressiveness
bertram
i
do
know
a
thing
about
cooking
except
what
i
been
learning
in
rosa
this
last
bertram
laughed
so
loud
that
the
man
across
the
aisle
glanced
over
the
top
of
his
paper
surreptitiously
rosa
is
that
what
you
were
doing
all
this
week
yes
that
is
i
tried
so
hard
to
learn
something
stammered
billy
but
i
afraid
i
did
much
there
were
so
many
things
for
me
to
think
of
you
know
with
only
a
week
i
believe
i
make
peach
fritters
though
they
were
the
last
thing
i
bertram
laughed
again
uproariously
but
at
billy
unchangingly
tragic
face
he
grew
suddenly
very
grave
and
tender
billy
dear
i
did
marry
you
to
to
get
a
cook
he
said
gently
billy
shook
her
head
i
know
but
aunt
hannah
said
that
even
if
i
never
expected
to
cook
myself
i
ought
to
know
how
it
was
done
so
to
properly
oversee
it
she
said
that
that
no
woman
who
did
know
how
to
cook
and
keep
house
properly
had
any
business
to
be
a
wife
and
bertram
i
did
try
honestly
all
this
week
i
tried
so
hard
to
remember
when
you
sponged
bread
and
when
you
kneaded
i
do
ever
need
cut
in
bertram
shamelessly
but
he
got
only
a
deservedly
stern
glance
in
return
and
i
repeated
over
and
over
again
how
many
cupfuls
of
flour
and
pinches
of
salt
and
spoonfuls
of
went
into
things
but
bertram
i
simply
could
not
keep
my
mind
on
it
everything
everywhere
was
singing
to
me
and
how
do
you
suppose
i
could
remember
how
many
pinches
of
flour
and
spoonfuls
of
salt
and
cupfuls
of
went
into
a
loaf
of
cake
when
all
the
while
the
very
teakettle
on
the
stove
was
singing
all
right
bertram
loves
me
i
going
to
marry
bertram
you
darling
in
spite
of
the
man
across
the
aisle
bertram
did
almost
kiss
her
this
time
as
if
anybody
cared
how
many
cupfuls
of
went
anywhere
with
that
in
your
heart
aunt
hannah
says
you
will
when
you
hungry
and
kate
said
bertram
uttered
a
sharp
word
behind
his
teeth
billy
for
heaven
sake
do
tell
me
what
kate
said
if
you
want
me
to
stay
sane
and
not
attempt
to
fight
somebody
broken
arm
and
all
kate
she
kind
and
i
suppose
she
means
well
but
well
made
trouble
enough
between
us
already
i
got
you
now
sweetheart
you
mine
all
mine
his
voice
shook
and
dropped
to
a
tender
whisper
death
us
do
part
yes
death
us
do
part
breathed
billy
and
then
for
a
time
they
fell
silent
bertram
take
thee
billy
sang
the
whirring
wheels
beneath
them
to
one
billy
take
thee
bertram
sang
the
whirring
wheels
beneath
them
to
the
other
while
straight
ahead
before
them
both
stretched
fair
and
beautiful
in
their
eyes
the
wondrous
path
of
life
which
they
were
to
tread
together
chapter
ii
for
william
a
home
on
the
first
sunday
after
the
wedding
pete
came
to
tell
his
master
william
that
stetson
wanted
to
see
him
in
the
william
went
down
at
once
well
aunt
hannah
he
began
reaching
out
a
cordial
hand
why
the
matter
he
broke
off
concernedly
as
he
caught
a
clearer
view
of
the
little
old
lady
drawn
face
and
troubled
eyes
william
it
silly
of
course
cried
aunt
hannah
tremulously
but
i
simply
had
to
go
to
some
one
i
i
feel
so
nervous
and
unsettled
did
did
billy
say
anything
to
you
what
she
was
going
to
do
what
she
was
going
to
do
about
what
what
do
you
mean
about
the
house
selling
it
faltered
aunt
hannah
sinking
wearily
back
into
her
chair
william
frowned
thoughtfully
why
no
he
answered
it
was
all
so
hurried
at
the
last
you
know
there
was
really
very
little
chance
to
make
plans
for
anything
except
the
wedding
he
finished
with
a
smile
yes
i
know
sighed
aunt
hannah
everything
was
in
such
confusion
still
i
did
know
but
she
might
have
said
something
to
no
she
did
but
i
imagine
it
wo
be
hard
to
guess
what
she
do
when
they
get
back
from
their
trip
i
fancy
she
wo
lose
much
time
in
having
what
things
she
wants
brought
down
here
then
she
sell
the
rest
and
put
the
house
on
the
yes
of
of
course
stammered
aunt
hannah
pulling
herself
hastily
to
a
more
erect
position
that
what
i
thought
too
then
do
you
think
we
better
dismiss
rosa
and
close
the
house
at
once
why
yes
perhaps
so
why
not
then
you
be
all
settled
here
when
she
comes
home
i
sure
the
sooner
you
come
the
better
i
be
pleased
he
smiled
aunt
hannah
turned
sharply
here
she
ejaculated
william
henshaw
you
did
suppose
i
was
coming
to
live
did
you
it
was
william
turn
to
look
amazed
why
of
course
you
coming
here
where
else
should
you
go
pray
where
i
was
before
before
billy
came
to
you
returned
aunt
hannah
a
little
tremulously
but
with
a
certain
dignity
i
shall
take
a
room
in
some
quiet
of
nonsense
aunt
hannah
as
if
billy
would
listen
to
that
you
came
before
why
not
come
now
aunt
hannah
lifted
her
chin
the
fraction
of
an
inch
you
forget
i
was
needed
before
billy
is
a
married
woman
now
she
needs
no
nonsense
scowled
william
again
billy
will
always
need
aunt
hannah
shook
her
head
mournfully
i
like
to
think
she
wants
me
william
but
i
know
in
my
heart
it
is
why
not
there
was
a
moment
pause
then
decisively
came
the
answer
because
i
think
young
married
folks
should
not
have
outsiders
in
the
william
laughed
relievedly
oh
so
that
it
well
aunt
hannah
you
no
outsider
come
run
right
along
home
and
pack
your
aunt
hannah
was
plainly
almost
crying
but
she
held
her
ground
william
i
ca
she
reiterated
but
billy
is
such
a
child
and
for
once
in
her
circumspect
life
aunt
hannah
was
guilty
of
an
interruption
pardon
me
william
she
is
not
a
child
she
is
a
woman
now
and
she
has
a
woman
problems
to
well
then
why
do
you
help
her
meet
them
retorted
william
still
with
a
whimsical
smile
but
aunt
hannah
did
not
smile
for
a
minute
she
did
not
speak
then
with
her
eyes
studiously
averted
she
said
william
the
first
four
years
of
my
married
life
were
were
spoiled
by
an
outsider
in
our
home
i
do
mean
to
spoil
william
relaxed
visibly
the
smile
fled
from
his
face
why
aunt
hannah
he
exclaimed
the
little
old
lady
turned
with
a
weary
sigh
yes
i
know
you
are
shocked
of
course
i
should
have
told
you
still
it
is
all
past
long
ago
and
i
wanted
to
make
you
understand
why
i
ca
come
he
was
my
husband
eldest
brother
a
bachelor
he
was
good
and
kind
and
meant
well
i
suppose
but
he
interfered
with
everything
i
was
young
and
probably
headstrong
at
all
events
there
was
constant
friction
he
went
away
once
and
stayed
two
whole
months
i
shall
never
forget
the
utter
freedom
and
happiness
of
those
months
for
us
with
the
whole
house
to
ourselves
no
william
i
ca
she
rose
abruptly
and
turned
toward
the
door
her
eyes
were
wistful
and
her
face
was
still
drawn
with
suffering
but
her
whole
frail
little
self
quivered
plainly
with
high
resolve
john
has
peggy
outside
i
must
but
but
aunt
hannah
began
william
helplessly
she
lifted
a
protesting
hand
no
do
urge
me
please
i
ca
come
here
but
i
believe
i
close
the
house
till
billy
gets
home
after
all
she
declared
the
next
moment
she
was
gone
and
william
dazedly
from
the
doorway
was
watching
john
help
her
into
billy
automobile
called
by
billy
and
half
her
friends
peggy
short
for
still
dazedly
william
turned
back
into
the
house
and
dropped
himself
into
the
nearest
chair
what
a
curious
call
it
had
been
aunt
hannah
had
not
acted
like
herself
at
all
not
once
had
she
said
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
while
the
things
she
said
someway
he
had
never
thought
of
aunt
hannah
as
being
young
and
a
bride
still
of
course
she
must
have
been
once
and
the
reason
she
gave
for
not
coming
there
to
live
the
pitiful
story
of
that
outsider
in
her
home
but
she
was
no
outsider
she
was
no
interfering
brother
of
billy
william
caught
his
breath
suddenly
and
held
it
suspended
then
he
gave
a
low
ejaculation
and
half
sprang
from
his
chair
spunkie
disturbed
from
her
doze
by
the
fire
uttered
a
purring
and
looked
up
inquiringly
for
a
long
minute
william
gazed
dumbly
into
the
cat
yellow
sleepily
contented
eyes
then
he
said
with
tragic
distinctness
spunkie
it
true
aunt
hannah
is
billy
husband
brother
but
i
am
do
you
hear
i
commented
spunkie
and
curled
herself
for
another
nap
there
was
no
peace
for
william
after
that
in
vain
he
told
himself
that
he
was
no
interfering
brother
and
that
this
was
his
home
and
had
been
all
his
life
in
vain
did
he
declare
emphatically
that
he
could
not
go
he
would
not
go
that
billy
would
not
wish
him
to
go
always
before
his
eyes
was
the
vision
of
that
little
bride
of
years
long
gone
always
in
his
ears
was
the
echo
of
aunt
hannah
i
shall
never
forget
the
utter
freedom
and
happiness
of
those
months
for
us
with
the
whole
house
to
nor
turn
which
way
he
would
could
he
find
anything
to
comfort
him
simply
because
he
was
so
fearfully
looking
for
it
he
found
it
the
thing
that
had
for
its
theme
the
wretchedness
that
might
be
expected
from
the
presence
of
a
third
person
in
the
new
home
poor
william
everywhere
he
met
it
the
hint
the
word
the
story
the
song
even
and
always
it
added
its
mite
to
the
woeful
whole
even
the
hoariest
of
jokes
had
its
sting
for
him
and
to
make
his
cup
quite
full
he
chanced
to
remember
one
day
what
marie
had
said
when
he
had
suggested
that
she
and
cyril
come
to
the
strata
to
live
no
i
think
young
folks
should
begin
by
unhappy
indeed
were
these
days
for
william
like
a
lost
spirit
he
wandered
from
room
to
room
touching
this
fingering
that
for
long
minutes
he
would
stand
before
some
picture
or
some
treasured
bit
of
old
mahogany
as
if
to
stamp
indelibly
upon
his
mind
a
thing
that
was
soon
to
be
no
more
at
other
times
like
a
man
without
a
home
he
would
go
out
into
the
common
or
the
public
garden
and
sit
for
hours
on
some
bench
thinking
all
this
could
have
but
one
ending
of
course
before
the
middle
of
august
william
summoned
pete
to
his
rooms
oh
pete
i
going
to
move
next
week
he
began
nonchalantly
his
voice
sounded
as
if
moving
were
a
pleasurable
circumstance
that
occurred
in
his
life
regularly
once
a
month
i
like
you
to
begin
to
pack
up
these
things
please
the
old
servant
mouth
fell
open
you
goin
to
to
what
sir
he
stammered
move
i
william
spoke
with
unusual
harshness
pete
wet
his
lips
you
mean
you
sold
the
old
place
sir
that
we
we
ai
goin
to
live
here
no
longer
sold
of
course
not
going
to
move
away
not
if
pete
could
have
known
what
caused
the
sharpness
in
his
voice
he
would
not
have
been
so
grieved
or
rather
he
would
have
been
grieved
for
a
different
reason
as
it
was
he
could
only
falter
miserably
are
goin
to
move
away
from
here
yes
yes
man
why
pete
what
ails
you
one
would
think
a
body
never
moved
they
did
not
you
william
turned
abruptly
so
that
his
face
could
not
be
seen
with
stern
deliberation
he
picked
up
an
elaborately
decorated
teapot
but
the
valuable
bit
of
lowestoft
shook
so
in
his
hand
that
he
set
it
down
at
once
it
clicked
sharply
against
its
neighbor
betraying
his
nervous
hand
pete
stirred
but
william
he
stammered
thickly
how
are
you
what
you
do
without
there
does
nobody
but
me
know
so
well
about
your
tea
and
the
two
lumps
in
your
coffee
and
there
your
flannels
that
you
never
put
on
till
i
get
out
and
the
woolen
socks
that
you
wear
all
summer
if
i
did
hide
and
and
who
goin
to
take
care
of
these
he
finished
with
a
glance
that
encompassed
the
overflowing
cabinets
and
shelves
of
curios
all
about
him
his
master
smiled
sadly
an
affection
that
had
its
inception
in
his
boyhood
days
shone
in
his
eyes
the
hand
in
which
the
lowestoft
had
shaken
rested
now
heavily
on
an
old
man
bent
shoulder
a
shoulder
that
straightened
itself
in
unconscious
loyalty
under
the
touch
pete
you
have
spoiled
me
and
no
mistake
i
do
expect
to
find
another
like
you
but
maybe
if
i
wear
the
woolen
socks
too
late
come
and
hunt
up
the
others
for
me
eh
and
with
a
smile
that
was
meant
to
be
quizzical
william
turned
and
began
to
shift
the
teapots
about
again
but
william
why
that
is
what
will
bertram
and
miss
billy
do
without
you
ventured
the
old
man
there
was
a
sudden
tinkling
crash
on
the
floor
lay
the
fragments
of
a
teapot
the
servant
exclaimed
aloud
in
dismay
but
his
master
did
not
even
glance
toward
his
once
treasured
possession
on
the
floor
nonsense
pete
he
was
saying
in
a
particularly
cheery
voice
have
you
lived
all
these
years
and
not
found
out
that
folks
do
any
one
else
around
come
do
you
suppose
we
could
begin
to
pack
these
teapots
he
added
a
little
feverishly
there
some
boxes
down
cellar
i
see
sir
said
pete
respectfully
but
the
expression
on
his
face
as
he
turned
away
showed
that
he
was
not
thinking
of
teapots
nor
of
boxes
in
which
to
pack
them
chapter
iii
billy
speaks
her
mind
and
bertram
henshaw
were
expected
home
the
first
of
september
by
the
of
august
the
old
beacon
street
homestead
facing
the
public
garden
was
in
order
with
dong
ling
in
the
basement
hovering
over
a
larder
and
pete
searching
the
rest
of
the
house
for
a
chair
awry
or
a
bit
of
dust
undiscovered
twice
before
had
the
strata
as
bertram
long
ago
dubbed
the
home
of
his
boyhood
been
prepared
for
the
coming
of
billy
william
namesake
once
when
it
had
been
decorated
with
guns
and
to
welcome
the
boy
who
turned
out
to
be
a
girl
and
again
when
with
pink
roses
and
the
three
brothers
got
joyously
ready
for
a
feminine
billy
who
did
not
even
come
at
all
the
house
had
been
very
different
then
it
had
been
indeed
a
strata
with
its
distinctive
layers
of
fads
and
pursuits
as
represented
by
bertram
and
his
painting
on
one
floor
william
and
his
curios
on
another
and
cyril
with
his
music
on
a
third
cyril
was
gone
now
only
pete
and
his
humble
belongings
occupied
the
top
floor
the
floor
below
too
was
silent
now
and
almost
empty
save
for
a
rug
or
two
and
a
few
pieces
of
heavy
furniture
that
william
had
not
cared
to
take
with
him
to
his
new
quarters
on
top
of
beacon
hill
below
this
however
came
billy
old
rooms
and
on
these
pete
had
lavished
all
his
skill
and
devotion
freshly
laundered
curtains
were
at
the
windows
dustless
rugs
were
on
the
floor
the
old
had
been
brought
down
from
the
storeroom
and
the
piano
stood
invitingly
open
in
a
conspicuous
place
also
sat
the
little
green
god
upon
whose
exquisitely
carved
shoulders
was
supposed
to
rest
the
heap
plenty
velly
good
luckee
of
dong
ling
prophecy
on
the
first
floor
bertram
old
rooms
and
the
came
in
for
their
share
of
the
general
overhauling
even
spunkie
did
not
escape
but
had
to
submit
to
the
ignominy
of
a
bath
and
then
dawned
fair
and
clear
the
first
day
of
september
bringing
at
five
the
bride
and
groom
respectfully
lined
up
in
the
hall
to
meet
them
were
pete
and
dong
ling
pete
with
his
wrinkled
old
face
alight
with
joy
and
excitement
dong

grinning
and
kotowing
and
chanting
in
a
treble
miss
billee
miss
billee
plenty
much
welcome
miss
billee
yes

bowed
bertram
turning
at
the
door
with
an
elaborate
flourish
that
did
not
in
the
least
hide
his
tender
pride
in
his
new
wife
billy
laughed
and
colored
a
pretty
pink
thank
you
all
of
you
she
cried
a
little
unsteadily
and
how
good
good
everything
does
look
to
me
why
where
uncle
william
she
broke
off
casting
hurriedly
anxious
eyes
about

echoed
bertram
where
is
he
pete
he
sick

a
quick
change

the
old
servant

shook
his
head
dumbly
billy
gave
a
gleeful
laugh
i

asleep
she
caroled
skipping
to
the
bottom
of
the
stairway
and
looking
up
ho

cleared
his
throat

he
corrected
miserably
billy
smiled
but
she
frowned
too
not
here
well
i
like
that
she
pouted
and
when
i
brought
him
the
most
beautiful
pair
of
mirror
knobs
he
ever
saw
and
all
the
way
in
my
bag
too
so
i
could
give
them
to

very
first
thing

over
to
the
small
bag
she
had
brought
in
with
her
glad
i

continued
laughingly
still
if

here
to
receive

beautiful
she
cried
carefully
taking
from
their
wrappings
two
exquisitely
decorated
porcelain
discs
mounted
on
two
long
spikes
they
batterseas
the
real
article
i
know
enough
for
that
and
they
finer
than

stammered
the
old
man
these
new
titles
come

they
pete
laughed
bertram
pete
smiled
faintly
never
mind
pete
soothed
his
new
mistress
you

call
me
billy
all
your
life
if
you
want
to
bertram
she
added
turning
to
her
husband
i
going
to
just
run
and
put
these
in
uncle
william
rooms
so
they
be
there
when
he
comes
in
we
see
how
soon
he
discovers
them
before
pete
could
stop
her
she
was
up
the
first
flight
of
stairs
even
then
he
tried
to
speak
to
his
young
master
to
explain
that
william
was
not
living
there
but
the
words
refused
to
come
he
could
only
stand
dumbly
waiting
in
a
minute
it
came
billy
sharp
startled
cry
bertram
bertram
bertram
sprang
for
the
stairway
but
he
had
not
reached
the
top
when
he
met
his
wife
coming
down
she
was
and
trembling
bertram
those
rooms
there
not
so
much
as
a
teapot
there
uncle
william
gone
gone
bertram
wheeled
sharply
pete
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
where
is
my
brother
to
hear
him
one
would
think
he
suspected
the
old
servant
of
having
hidden
his
master
pete
lifted
a
shaking
hand
and
fumbled
with
his
collar
he
moved
moved
oh
you
mean
to
other
rooms
to
bertram
relaxed
visibly
he
upstairs
pete
shook
his
head
no
sir
he
moved
away
out
of
the
house
for
a
brief
moment
bertram
stared
as
if
he
could
not
believe
what
his
ears
had
heard
then
step
by
step
he
began
to
descend
the
stairs
do
you
mean
to
say
that
my
brother
has
away
his
he
demanded
yes
billy
gave
a
low
cry
but
why
why
she
choked
almost
stumbling
headlong
down
the
stairway
in
her
effort
to
reach
the
two
men
at
the
bottom
pete
why
did
he
go
there
was
no
answer
pete
bertram
voice
was
very
sharp
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
do
you
know
why
my
brother
left
his
home
the
old
man
wet
his
lips
and
swallowed
chokingly
but
he
did
not
speak
i
waiting
billy
laid
one
hand
on
the
old
servant
arm
in
the
other
hand
she
still
tightly
clutched
the
mirror
knobs
pete
if
you
do
know
wo
you
tell
us
please
she
begged
pete
looked
down
at
the
hand
then
up
at
the
troubled
young
face
with
the
beseeching
eyes
his
own
features
worked
convulsively
with
a
visible
effort
he
cleared
his
throat
i
know
what
he
said
he
stammered
his
eyes
averted
what
was
it
there
was
no
answer
look
here
pete
you
have
to
tell
us
you
know
cut
in
bertram
decisively
so
you
might
as
well
do
it
now
as
once
more
pete
cleared
his
throat
this
time
the
words
came
in
a
burst
of
desperation
yes
sir
i
understand
sir
it
was
only
that
he
said
he
said
as
how
young
folks
did
any
one
else
around
so
he
was
did
any
one
else
exclaimed
bertram
plainly
not
comprehending
yes
sir
you
two
bein
married
so
pete
eyes
were
still
averted
billy
gave
a
low
cry
you
mean
because
came
she
demanded
why
yes
miss
no
that
is
pete
stopped
with
an
appealing
glance
at
bertram
then
it
was
it
on
account
of
choked
billy
pete
looked
still
more
distressed
no
no
he
faltered
it
was
only
that
he
thought
you
would
want
him
here
want
him
here
ejaculated
bertram
want
him
here
echoed
billy
with
a
sob
pete
where
is
he
as
she
asked
the
question
she
dropped
the
mirror
knobs
into
her
open
bag
and
reached
for
her
coat
and
gloves
she
had
not
removed
her
hat
pete
gave
the
address
it
just
down
the
street
a
bit
and
up
the
hill
he
added
excitedly
divining
her
purpose
it
a
sort
of
a
i
a
for
uncle
william
scorned
billy
her
eyes
ablaze
come
bertram
we
see
about
bertram
reached
out
a
detaining
hand
but
dearest
you
so
tired
he
demurred
had
we
better
wait
till
after
dinner
or
till
after
dinner
billy
eyes
blazed
anew
why
bertram
henshaw
do
you
think
i
leave
that
dear
man
even
one
minute
longer
if
i
could
help
it
with
a
notion
in
his
blessed
old
head
that
we
him
but
you
said
a
little
while
ago
you
had
a
headache
dear
still
objected
bertram
if
you
just
eat
your
dinner

billy
i
wonder
if
you
think
i
could
eat
any
dinner
with
uncle
william
turned
out
of
his
home
i
going
to
find
uncle
and
she
stumbled
blindly
toward
the
door
bertram
reached
for
his
hat
he
threw
a
despairing
glance
into
eyes
we
be
back
when
we
can
he
said
with
a
frown
yes
sir
answered
pete
respectfully
then
as
if
impelled
by
some
hidden
force
he
touched
his
master
arm
it
was
that
way
she
looked
sir
when
she
came
to
that
night
last
july
with
her
eyes
all
shining
he
whispered
a
tender
smile
curved
bertram
lips
the
frown
vanished
from
his
face
bless
you
pete
and
bless
her
too
he
whispered
back
the
next
moment
he
had
hurried
after
his
wife
the
house
that
bore
the
number
pete
had
given
proved
to
have
a
pretentious
doorway
and
a
landlady
who
in
response
to
the
summons
of
the
neat
maid
appeared
with
a
most
impressive
rustle
of
black
silk
and
jet
bugles
no
william
henshaw
was
not
in
his
rooms
in
fact
he
was
very
seldom
there
his
business
she
believed
called
him
to
state
street
through
the
day
outside
of
that
she
had
been
told
he
spent
much
time
sitting
on
a
bench
in
the
common
doubtless
if
they
cared
to
search
they
could
find
him
there
now
a
bench
in
the
common
indeed
stormed
billy
as
she
and
bertram
hurried
down
the
wide
stone
steps
uncle
william
on
a
bench
but
surely
now
dear
ventured
her
husband
you
come
home
and
get
your
dinner
billy
turned
indignantly
and
leave
uncle
william
on
a
bench
in
the
common
indeed
no
why
bertram
you
would
either
she
cried
as
she
turned
resolutely
toward
one
of
the
entrances
to
the
common
and
bertram
with
the
eyes
all
shining
still
before
him
could
only
murmur
no
of
course
not
dear
and
follow
obediently
where
she
led
under
ordinary
circumstances
it
would
have
been
a
delightful
hour
for
a
walk
the
sun
had
almost
set
and
the
shadows
lay
long
across
the
grass
the
air
was
cool
and
unusually
bracing
for
a
day
so
early
in
september
but
all
this
was
lost
on
bertram
bertram
did
not
wish
to
take
a
walk
he
was
hungry
he
wanted
his
dinner
and
he
wanted
too
his
old
home
with
his
new
wife
flitting
about
the
rooms
as
he
had
pictured
this
first
evening
together
he
wanted
william
of
course
certainly
he
wanted
william
but
if
william
would
insist
on
running
away
and
sitting
on
park
benches
in
this
ridiculous
fashion
he
ought
to
take
the
consequences
until
five
ten
fifteen
minutes
passed
up
one
path
and
down
another
trudged
the
billy
and
her
increasingly
impatient
husband
then
when
the
fifteen
weary
minutes
had
become
a
still
more
weary
the
bonds
bertram
had
set
on
his
temper
snapped
billy
he
remonstrated
despairingly
do
please
come
home
do
you
see
how
highly
improbable
it
is
that
we
should
happen
on
william
if
we
walked
like
this
all
night
he
might
move
change
his
seat
go
home
even
he
probably
has
gone
home
and
surely
never
before
did
a
bride
insist
on
spending
the
first
evening
after
her
return
tramping
up
and
down
a
public
park
for
hour
after
hour
like
this
looking
for
any
man
you
come
home
but
billy
had
not
even
heard
with
a
glad
little
cry
she
had
darted
to
the
side
of
the
figure
of
a
man
alone
on
a
park
bench
just
ahead
of
them
uncle
william
oh
uncle
william
how
could
you
she
cried
dropping
herself
on
to
one
end
of
the
seat
and
catching
the
man
arm
in
both
her
hands
yes
how
could
you
demanded
bertram
with
just
a
touch
of
irritation
dropping
himself
on
to
the
other
end
of
the
seat
and
catching
the
other
arm
in
his
one
usable
hand
the
bent
shoulders
and
bowed
head
straightened
up
with
a
jerk
well
well
bless
my
soul
if
it
is
our
little
bride
cried
uncle
william
fondly
and
the
happy
bridegroom
too
when
did
you
get
home
we
have
got
home
retorted
bertram
promptly
before
his
wife
could
speak
oh
we
looked
in
at
the
door
an
hour
or
so
back
but
we
stay
we
been
hunting
for
you
ever
nonsense
children
uncle
william
spoke
with
gay
cheeriness
but
he
refused
to
meet
either
billy
or
bertram
eyes
uncle
william
how
could
you
do
it
reproached
billy
again
do
what
uncle
william
was
plainly
fencing
for
time
leave
the
house
like
that
ho
i
wanted
a
as
if
we
believe
that
scoffed
billy
all
right
let
call
it
you
had
the
change
then
laughed
bertram
and
we
send
over
for
your
things
come
now
let
go
home
to
william
shook
his
head
he
essayed
a
gay
smile
why
i
only
just
begun
i
going
to
stay
oh
i
do
know
how
long
i
going
to
stay
he
finished
blithely
billy
lifted
her
chin
a
little
uncle
william
you
are
playing
square
pete
told
us
what
you
said
when
you
eh
what
william
looked
up
with
startled
eyes
about
about
our
not
you
so
we
know
now
why
you
left
and
we
pete
that
oh
that
that
nonsense
i
i
settle
with
billy
laughed
softly
poor
pete
do
we
simply
dragged
it
out
of
him
and
now
we
here
to
tell
you
that
we
want
you
and
that
you
come
again
william
shook
his
head
a
swift
shadow
crossed
his
face
thank
you
no
children
he
said
dully
you
very
kind
but
you
do
need
me
i
should
be
just
an
interfering
elder
brother
i
should
spoil
your
young
married
william
voice
now
sounded
as
if
he
were
reciting
a
lesson
if
i
went
away
and
stayed
two
months
you
never
forget
the
utter
freedom
and
joy
of
those
two
whole
months
with
the
house
all
to
uncle
william
gasped
billy
what
you
talking
about
about
about
my
not
going
back
of
but
you
are
coming
back
cut
in
bertram
almost
angrily
oh
come
will
this
is
utter
nonsense
and
you
know
it
come
let
go
home
to
a
stern
look
came
to
the
corners
of
william
mouth
a
look
that
bertram
understood
well
all
right
i
go
to
dinner
of
course
but
i
stay
said
william
firmly
i
thought
it
all
out
i
know
i
right
come
go
to
dinner
now
and
say
no
more
about
it
he
finished
with
a
cheery
smile
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
then
to
the
bride
he
added
did
you
have
a
nice
trip
little
girl
billy
too
had
risen
now
but
she
did
not
seem
to
have
heard
his
question
in
the
fast
falling
twilight
her
face
looked
a
little
white
uncle
william
she
began
very
quietly
do
you
think
for
a
minute
that
just
because
i
married
your
brother
i
am
going
to
live
in
that
house
and
turn
you
out
of
the
home
you
lived
in
all
your
life
nonsense
dear
i
not
turned
out
i
just
go
corrected
uncle
william
gayly
with
superb
disdain
billy
brushed
this
aside
oh
no
you
wo
she
declared
but
billy
gasped
bertram
my
my
dear
expostulated
william
faintly
uncle
william
bertram
listen
panted
billy
i
never
told
you
much
before
but
i
going
to
now
long
ago
when
i
went
away
with
aunt
hannah
your
sister
kate
showed
me
how
dear
the
old
home
was
to
you
how
much
you
thought
of
it
and
she
said
she
said
that
i
had
upset
bertram
interjected
a
sharp
word
but
billy
paid
no
attention
that
why
i
went
and
shall
go
if
you
do
come
home
to
stay
uncle
william
come
now
let
go
to
dinner
please
bertram
hungry
she
finished
with
a
bright
smile
there
was
a
tense
moment
of
silence
william
glanced
at
bertram
bertram
returned
the
glance
with
interest
er
ah
yes
well
we
might
go
to
dinner
stammered
william
after
a
minute
er
yes
agreed
bertram
and
the
three
fell
into
step
together
chapter
iv
just
like
billy
billy
did
not
leave
the
strata
this
time
before
hours
had
passed
the
last
cherished
fragment
of
william
henshaw
possessions
had
been
carefully
carried
down
the
imposing
steps
of
the
beacon
hill
under
the
disapproving
eyes
of
its
mistress
who
found
herself
now
with
a
month
advance
rent
and
two
vacant
parlors
on
her
hands
before
another
hours
had
passed
her
quondam
boarder
with
a
tired
sigh
sank
into
his
favorite
morris
chair
in
his
old
familiar
rooms
and
looked
about
him
with
contented
eyes
every
treasure
was
in
place
from
the
traditional
four
small
stones
of
his
babyhood
days
to
the
batterseas
billy
had
just
brought
him
pete
as
of
yore
was
hovering
near
with
a
bertram
gay
whistle
sounded
from
the
floor
below
william
henshaw
was
at
home
again
this
much
accomplished
billy
went
to
see
aunt
hannah
aunt
hannah
greeted
her
affectionately
though
with
tearfully
troubled
eyes
she
was
wearing
a
gray
shawl
topped
with
a
black
one
sure
sign
of
unrest
either
physical
or
mental
as
all
her
friends
knew
i
begun
to
think
you
forgotten
me
she
faltered
with
a
poor
attempt
at
gayety
you
been
home
three
whole
i
know
dearie
smiled
billy
and
was
a
shame
but
i
have
been
so
busy
my
trunks
came
at
last
and
i
been
helping
uncle
william
get
settled
aunt
hannah
looked
puzzled
uncle
william
get
settled
you
mean
he
changed
his
room
billy
laughed
oddly
and
threw
a
swift
glance
into
aunt
hannah
face
well
yes
he
did
change
she
murmured
but
he
moved
back
now
into
the
old
quarters
er
you
have
heard
from
uncle
william
then
lately
i
take
aunt
hannah
shook
her
head
abstractedly
i
did
see
him
once
several
weeks
ago
but
i
have
since
we
had
quite
a
talk
then
and
billy
i
been
wanting
to
speak
to
you
she
hurried
on
a
little
feverishly
i
did
like
to
leave
of
course
till
you
did
come
home
as
long
as
you
said
nothing
about
your
plans
but
leave
interposed
billy
dazedly
leave
where
what
do
you
mean
why
leave
here
of
course
dear
i
mean
i
did
like
to
get
my
room
while
you
were
away
but
i
shall
now
of
course
at
nonsense
aunt
hannah
as
if
i
let
you
do
that
laughed
billy
aunt
hannah
stiffened
perceptibly
her
lips
looked
suddenly
thin
and
determined
even
the
soft
little
curls
above
her
ears
seemed
actually
to
bristle
with
resolution
billy
she
began
firmly
we
might
as
well
understand
each
other
at
once
i
know
your
good
heart
and
i
appreciate
your
kindness
but
i
can
not
come
to
live
with
you
i
shall
not
it
would
be
best
i
should
be
like
an
interfering
elder
brother
in
your
home
i
should
spoil
your
young
married
life
and
if
i
went
away
for
two
months
you
never
forget
the
utter
joy
and
freedom
of
those
two
months
with
the
whole
house
ali
to
at
the
beginning
of
this
speech
billy
eyes
had
still
carried
their
dancing
smile
but
as
the
peroration
progressed
on
to
the
end
a
dawning
surprise
which
soon
became
a
puzzled
questioning
drove
the
smile
away
then
billy
sat
suddenly
erect
why
aunt
hannah
that
exactly
what
uncle
william
billy
stopped
and
regarded
aunt
hannah
with
quick
suspicion
the
next
moment
she
burst
into
gleeful
laughter
aunt
hannah
looked
grieved
and
not
a
little
surprised
but
billy
did
not
seem
to
notice
this
oh
oh
aunt
hannah
you
too
how
perfectly
funny
she
gurgled
to
think
you
two
old
blesseds
should
get
your
heads
together
like
this
aunt
hannah
stirred
restively
and
pulled
the
black
shawl
more
closely
about
her
indeed
billy
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
that
she
sighed
with
a
visible
effort
at
but
i
do
know
that
i
can
not
go
to
live
with
bless
your
heart
dear
i
do
want
you
to
soothed
billy
with
gay
promptness
oh
stammered
aunt
hannah
surprise
mortification
dismay
and
a
grieved
hurt
bringing
a
flood
of
color
to
her
face
it
is
one
thing
to
refuse
a
home
and
quite
another
to
have
a
home
refused
you
oh
aunt
hannah
cried
billy
turning
very
red
in
her
turn
please
do
look
like
that
i
did
mean
it
that
way
i
do
want
you
dear
only
i
want
you
somewhere
else
more
i
want
you
here
aunt
hannah
looked
relieved
but
unconvinced
yes
do
you
like
it
here
like
it
why
i
love
it
dear
you
know
i
do
but
you
do
need
this
house
now
oh
yes
i
do
retorted
billy
airily
i
going
to
keep
it
up
and
i
want
you
here
fiddlededee
billy
as
if
i
let
you
keep
up
this
house
just
for
me
scorned
aunt
hannah
is
just
for
you
it
for
for
lots
of
my
grief
and
conscience
billy
what
are
you
talking
about
billy
laughed
and
settled
herself
more
comfortably
on
the
hassock
at
aunt
hannah
feet
well
i
tell
you
just
now
i
want
it
for
tommy
dunn
and
the
greggorys
if
i
can
get
them
and
maybe
one
or
two
others
always
be
somebody
you
see
i
had
thought
i
have
them
at
the
tommy
dunn
at
the
strata
billy
laughed
again
ruefully
o
dear
you
sound
just
like
bertram
she
pouted
he
did
want
tommy
either
nor
any
of
the
rest
of
the
rest
of
them
well
i
could
have
had
a
lot
more
you
know
the
strata
is
so
big
especially
now
that
cyril
has
gone
and
left
all
those
empty
rooms
got
real
enthusiastic
but
bertram
did
he
just
laughed
and
said
until
he
found
i
was
really
in
earnest
then
he
well
he
said
then
too
only
he
did
laugh
finished
billy
with
a
sigh
aunt
hannah
regarded
her
with
fond
though
slightly
exasperated
eyes
billy
you
are
indeed
a
most
extraordinary
young
woman
at
times
surely
with
you
a
body
never
knows
what
to
expect
except
the
why
aunt
hannah
and
from
you
too
reproached
billy
mischievously
but
aunt
hannah
had
yet
more
to
say
of
course
bertram
thought
it
was
nonsense
the
idea
of
you
a
bride
filling
up
your
house
with
with
people
like
that
tommy
dunn
indeed
oh
bertram
said
he
liked
tommy
all
right
sighed
billy
but
he
said
that
that
did
mean
he
wanted
him
for
three
meals
a
day
one
would
think
poor
tommy
was
a
breakfast
food
so
that
is
when
i
thought
of
keeping
up
this
house
you
see
and
that
why
i
want
you
here
to
take
charge
of
it
and
you
do
that
for
me
wo
you
aunt
hannah
fell
back
in
her
chair
why
billy
of
course
if
if
you
want
it
but
what
an
extraordinary
idea
child
billy
shook
her
head
a
deeper
color
came
to
her
cheeks
and
a
softer
glow
to
her
eyes
i
do
think
so
aunt
hannah
it
only
that
i
so
happy
that
some
of
it
has
just
got
to
overflow
somewhere
and
this
is
going
to
be
the
overflow
house
a
sort
of
safety
valve
for
me
you
see
i
going
to
call
it
the
annex
it
will
be
an
annex
to
our
home
and
i
want
to
keep
it
full
always
of
people
who
who
can
make
the
best
use
of
all
that
extra
happiness
that
i
ca
possibly
use
myself
she
finished
a
little
tremulously
do
you
see
oh
yes
i
replied
aunt
hannah
with
a
fond
shake
of
the
head
but
really
listen
it
sensible
urged
billy
first
tommy
his
mother
died
last
month
he
at
a
neighbor
now
but
going
to
send
him
to
a
home
for
crippled
children
and
he
grieving
his
heart
out
over
it
i
going
to
bring
him
here
to
a
real
home
the
kind
that
does
begin
with
a
capital
letter
he
adores
music
and
he
got
real
talent
i
think
then
there
the
aunt
hannah
looked
dubious
you
ca
get
the
greggorys
to
to
use
any
of
that
happiness
billy
they
too
billy
smiled
radiantly
i
know
i
ca
get
them
to
it
aunt
hannah
but
i
believe
i
can
get
them
to
it
she
declared
triumphantly
i
shall
ask
alice
greggory
to
teach
tommy
music
and
i
shall
ask
greggory
to
teach
him
books
and
i
shall
tell
them
both
that
i
positively
need
them
to
keep
you
oh
but
billy
bridled
aunt
hannah
with
prompt
objection
tut
tut
i
know
you
be
willing
to
be
thrown
as
a
little
bit
of
a
sop
to
the
greggorys
pride
coaxed
billy
you
just
wait
till
i
get
the
overflow
annex
in
running
order
why
aunt
hannah
you
do
know
how
busy
you
going
to
be
handing
out
all
that
extra
happiness
that
i
ca
use
you
dear
child
aunt
hannah
smiled
mistily
the
black
shawl
had
fallen
unheeded
to
the
floor
now
as
if
anybody
ever
had
any
more
happiness
than
one
self
could
use
i
have
avowed
billy
promptly
and
it
going
to
keep
growing
and
growing
i
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
billy
do
exclaimed
aunt
hannah
lifting
shocked
hands
of
remonstrance
rap
on
wood
do
how
can
you
boast
like
that
billy
dimpled
roguishly
and
sprang
to
her
feet
why
aunt
hannah
i
ashamed
of
you
to
be
superstitious
like
that
you
a
good
presbyterian
aunt
hannah
subsided
shamefacedly
yes
i
know
billy
it
is
silly
but
i
just
ca
help
oh
but
it
worse
than
silly
aunt
hannah
teased
billy
with
a
remorseless
chuckle
it
really
bertram
told
me
once
that
it
dates
back
to
the
time
of
the
druids
appealing
to
the
god
of
trees
or
something
like
that
when
you
rap
on
wood
you
ugh
shuddered
aunt
hannah
as
if
i
would
billy
how
is
bertram
by
the
by
a
swift
shadow
crossed
billy
bright
face
he
lovely
only
his
his
arm
but
i
thought
that
was
oh
it
is
drooped
billy
but
it
gets
along
so
slowly
and
it
frets
him
dreadfully
you
know
he
never
can
do
anything
with
his
left
hand
he
says
and
he
just
hates
to
have
things
done
for
him
though
pete
and
dong
ling
are
quarreling
with
each
other
all
the
time
to
do
things
for
him
and
i
quarreling
with
both
of
them
to
do
them
for
him
myself
by
the
way
dong
ling
is
going
to
leave
us
next
week
did
you
know
it
dong
ling
leave
yes
oh
he
told
bertram
long
ago
he
should
go
when
we
were
married
that
he
had
plenty
much
money
and
was
going
back
to
china
and
not
be
melican
man
any
longer
but
i
do
think
bertram
thought
he
do
it
william
says
dong
ling
went
to
pete
however
after
we
left
and
told
him
he
wanted
to
go
that
he
liked
the
little
missee
plenty
well
but
that
there
be
too
much
when
she
got
back
and
why
the
impudent
creature
billy
laughed
merrily
yes
pete
was
furious
william
says
but
dong
ling
did
mean
any
disrespect
i
sure
he
just
was
used
to
having
petticoats
around
and
did
want
to
take
orders
from
them
that
but
billy
what
will
you
do
oh
pete
fixed
all
that
lovely
returned
billy
nonchalantly
you
know
his
niece
lives
over
in
south
boston
and
it
seems
she
got
a
daughter
who
a
fine
cook
and
will
be
glad
to
come
mercy
look
at
the
time
she
broke
off
glancing
at
the
clock
i
shall
be
late
to
dinner
and
dong
ling
loathes
anybody
who
late
to
his
meals
as
i
found
out
to
my
sorrow
the
night
we
got
home
dear
i
be
out
soon
again
and
fix
it
all
up
about
the
annex
you
and
with
a
bright
smile
she
was
gone
dear
me
sighed
aunt
hannah
stooping
to
pick
up
the
black
shawl
dear
me
of
course
everything
will
be
all
right
there
a
girl
coming
even
if
dong
ling
is
going
but
but
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
what
an
extraordinary
child
billy
is
to
be
sure
but
what
a
dear
one
she
added
wiping
a
quick
tear
from
her
eye
an
overflow
annex
indeed
for
her
happiness
now
is
that
just
like
billy
chapter
tiger
skins
september
passed
and
october
came
bringing
with
it
cool
days
and
clear
crisp
evenings
royally
ruled
over
by
a
gorgeous
harvest
moon
according
to
billy
everything
was
just
perfect
except
of
course
poor
arm
and
even
the
fact
that
that
gained
so
slowly
was
not
without
its
advantage
again
according
to
billy
for
it
gave
bertram
more
time
to
be
with
her
you
see
dear
as
long
as
you
paint
she
told
him
earnestly
one
day
why
i
not
really
hindering
you
by
keeping
you
with
me
so
you
certainly
are
not
he
retorted
with
a
smile
then
i
may
be
just
as
happy
as
i
like
over
it
settled
billy
comfortably
as
if
you
ever
could
hinder
me
he
ridiculed
oh
yes
i
could
nodded
billy
emphatically
you
forget
sir
that
was
what
worried
me
so
everybody
even
the
newspapers
and
magazines
said
i
do
it
too
they
said
i
slay
your
art
stifle
your
ambition
destroy
your
inspiration
and
be
a
nuisance
generally
and
kate
said
yes
well
never
mind
what
kate
said
interrupted
the
man
savagely
billy
laughed
and
gave
his
ear
a
playful
tweak
all
right
but
i
not
going
to
do
it
you
know
spoil
your
career
sir
you
just
wait
she
continued
dramatically
the
minute
your
arm
gets
so
you
can
paint
i
myself
shall
conduct
you
to
your
studio
thrust
the
brushes
into
your
hand
fill
your
palette
with
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
and
order
you
to
paint
my
lord
paint
but
until
then
going
to
have
you
all
i
like
she
finished
with
a
complete
change
of
manner
nestling
into
the
ready
curve
of
his
good
left
arm
you
witch
laughed
the
man
fondly
why
billy
you
could
hinder
me
you
my
inspiration
dear
instead
of
slaying
it
you
see
time
marguerite
winthrop
portrait
is
going
to
be
a
billy
turned
quickly
then
you
are
that
is
you
have
i
mean
you
going
to
paint
it
i
just
am
avowed
the
artist
and
this
time
it
be
a
success
too
with
you
to
billy
drew
in
her
breath
tremulously
i
did
know
but
you
already
started
it
she
faltered
he
shook
his
head
no
after
the
other
one
failed
and
winthrop
asked
me
to
try
again
i
could
i
was
so
troubled
over
you
that
the
time
you
did
hinder
me
he
smiled
then
came
your
note
breaking
the
engagement
of
course
i
knew
too
much
to
attempt
a
thing
like
that
portrait
then
but
now
the
pause
and
the
emphasis
were
eloquent
of
course
nodded
billy
brightly
but
a
little
feverishly
and
when
do
you
begin
not
till
january
miss
winthrop
wo
be
back
till
then
i
saw
last
week
and
i
told
him
i
accept
his
offer
to
try
what
did
he
say
he
gave
my
left
hand
a
big
grip
and
said
and
you
win
out
this
time
of
course
you
will
nodded
billy
again
though
still
a
little
feverishly
and
this
time
i
mind
a
bit
if
you
do
stay
to
luncheon
and
break
engagements
with
me
sir
she
went
on
tilting
her
chin
archly
for
i
shall
know
it
the
portrait
and
not
the
sitter
that
really
keeping
you
oh
you
see
what
a
fine
artist
wife
make
the
very
best
declared
bertram
so
ardently
that
billy
blushed
and
shook
her
head
in
reproof
nonsense
i
was
fishing
i
did
mean
it
that
way
she
protested
then
as
he
tried
to
catch
her
she
laughed
and
danced
teasingly
out
of
his
reach
because
bertram
could
not
paint
therefore
billy
had
him
quite
to
herself
these
october
days
nor
did
she
hesitate
to
appropriate
him
neither
on
his
part
was
bertram
loath
to
be
appropriated
like
two
lovers
they
read
and
walked
and
talked
together
and
like
two
children
sometimes
they
romped
through
the
stately
old
rooms
with
spunkie
or
with
tommy
dunn
who
was
a
frequent
guest
spunkie
be
it
known
was
renewing
her
kittenhood
so
potent
was
the
influence
of
the
dangling
strings
and
rolling
balls
that
she
encountered
everywhere
and
tommy
dunn
with
billy
help
was
learning
that
not
even
a
pair
of
crutches
need
keep
a
lonely
little
lad
from
a
frolic
even
william
roused
from
his
doze
by
peals
of
laughter
was
sometimes
inveigled
into
activities
that
left
him
breathless
but
curiously
aglow
while
pete
polishing
silver
in
the
smiled
indulgently
at
the
merry
clatter
above
and
forgot
the
teasing
pain
in
his
side
but
it
was
not
all
nonsense
with
billy
nor
gay
laughter
more
often
it
was
a
tender
glow
in
the
eyes
a
softness
in
the
voice
a
radiant
something
like
an
aura
of
joy
all
about
her
that
told
how
happy
indeed
were
these
days
for
her
there
was
proof
by
word
of
mouth
too
long
talks
with
bertram
in
the
dancing
firelight
when
they
laid
dear
plans
for
the
future
and
when
she
tried
so
hard
to
make
her
husband
understand
what
a
good
good
wife
she
intended
to
be
and
how
she
meant
never
to
let
anything
come
between
them
it
was
so
earnest
and
serious
a
billy
by
this
time
that
bertram
would
turn
startled
dismayed
eyes
on
his
young
wife
whereupon
with
a
very
change
of
mood
she
would
give
him
one
of
her
rare
caresses
and
perhaps
sigh
goosey
it
only
because
i
so
happy
happy
happy
why
bertram
if
it
were
for
that
overflow
annex
i
believe
i
i
just
could
live
it
was
bertram
who
sighed
then
and
who
prayed
fervently
in
his
heart
that
never
might
he
see
a
real
shadow
cloud
that
dear
face
thus
far
certainly
the
cares
of
matrimony
had
rested
anything
but
heavily
upon
the
shapely
young
shoulders
of
the
new
wife
domestic
affairs
at
the
strata
moved
like
a
piece
of
machinery
dong
ling
to
be
sure
was
not
there
but
in
his
place
reigned
grandniece
a
capable
young
woman
who
bertram
declared
cooked
like
an
angel
and
minded
her
own
business
like
a
man
pete
as
of
yore
had
full
charge
of
the
house
and
a
casual
eye
would
see
few
changes
even
the
brothers
themselves
saw
few
for
that
matter
true
at
the
very
first
billy
had
donned
a
ruffled
apron
and
a
bewitching
and
had
traversed
the
house
from
cellar
to
garret
with
a
prettily
important
air
of
managing
things
as
she
suggested
changes
right
and
left
she
had
summoned
pete
too
for
three
mornings
in
succession
and
with
great
dignity
had
ordered
the
meals
for
the
day
but
when
bertram
was
discovered
one
evening
tugging
back
his
favorite
chair
and
when
william
had
asked
if
billy
were
through
using
his
the
young
wife
had
concluded
to
let
things
remain
about
as
they
were
and
when
william
ate
no
breakfast
one
morning
and
bertram
aggrievedly
refused
dessert
that
night
at
dinner
billy
learning
through
an
apologetic
pete
that
master
william
always
had
to
have
eggs
for
breakfast
no
matter
what
else
there
was
and
that
master
bertram
never
ate
boiled
rice
gave
up
planning
the
meals
true
for
three
more
mornings
she
summoned
pete
for
orders
but
the
orders
were
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
blithe
well
pete
what
are
we
going
to
have
for
dinner
by
the
end
of
a
week
even
this
ceremony
was
given
up
and
before
a
month
had
passed
billy
was
little
more
than
a
guest
in
her
own
home
so
far
as
responsibility
was
concerned
billy
was
not
idle
however
far
from
it
first
there
were
the
delightful
hours
with
bertram
then
there
was
her
music
billy
was
writing
a
new
song
the
best
she
had
ever
written
billy
declared
why
bertram
it
ca
help
being
that
she
said
to
her
husband
one
day
the
words
just
sang
themselves
to
me
right
out
of
my
heart
and
the
melody
just
dropped
down
from
the
sky
and
now
everywhere
hearing
the
most
wonderful
harmonies
the
whole
universe
is
singing
to
me
if
only
now
i
can
put
it
on
paper
what
i
hear
then
i
can
make
the
whole
universe
sing
to
some
one
else
even
music
however
had
to
step
one
side
for
the
wedding
calls
which
were
beginning
to
be
received
and
which
must
be
returned
in
spite
of
the
occasional
rebellion
of
the
young
husband
there
were
the
more
intimate
friends
to
be
seen
also
and
cyril
and
marie
to
be
visited
and
always
there
was
the
annex
the
annex
was
in
fine
running
order
now
and
was
a
source
of
infinite
satisfaction
to
its
founder
and
great
happiness
to
its
beneficiaries
tommy
dunn
was
there
learning
wonderful
things
from
books
and
still
more
wonderful
things
from
the
piano
in
the
alice
greggory
and
her
mother
were
there
too
the
result
of
much
persuasion
indeed
according
to
bertram
billy
had
been
able
to
fill
the
annex
only
by
telling
each
prospective
resident
that
he
or
she
was
absolutely
necessary
to
the
welfare
and
happiness
of
every
other
resident
not
that
the
house
was
full
either
there
were
still
two
unoccupied
rooms
but
then
i
glad
there
are
billy
had
declared
for
there
sure
to
be
some
one
that
i
want
to
send
some
did
you
say
bertram
had
retorted
meaningly
but
his
wife
had
disdained
to
answer
this
billy
herself
was
frequently
at
the
annex
she
told
aunt
hannah
that
she
had
to
come
often
to
bring
the
happiness
it
accumulated
so
fast
certainly
she
always
found
plenty
to
do
there
whenever
she
came
there
was
aunt
hannah
to
be
read
to
greggory
to
be
sung
to
and
tommy
dunn
to
be
listened
to
for
tommy
dunn
was
always
quivering
with
eagerness
to
play
her
his
latest
billy
knew
that
some
day
at
the
annex
she
would
meet
arkwright
and
she
told
herself
that
she
hoped
she
should
billy
had
not
seen
arkwright
except
on
the
stage
of
the
boston
opera
house
since
the
day
he
had
left
her
presence
in
misery
after
declaring
his
love
for
her
and
learning
of
her
engagement
to
bertram
since
then
she
knew
he
had
been
much
with
his
old
friend
alice
greggory
she
did
not
believe
should
she
see
him
now
that
he
would
be
either
or
his
heart
she
was
sure
had
gone
where
it
ought
to
have
gone
in
the
first
place
to
alice
such
being
in
her
opinion
the
case
she
longed
to
get
the
embarrassment
of
a
first
meeting
between
themselves
over
with
for
after
that
she
was
sure
their
old
friendship
could
be
renewed
and
she
would
be
in
a
position
to
further
this
pretty
love
affair
between
him
and
alice
very
decidedly
therefore
billy
wished
to
meet
arkwright
very
pleased
consequently
was
she
when
one
day
coming
into
the
at
the
annex
she
found
the
man
sitting
by
the
fire
arkwright
was
on
his
feet
at
once
miss
h
henshaw
he
stammered
oh
arkwright
she
cried
with
just
a
shade
of
nervousness
in
her
voice
as
she
advanced
her
hand
outstretched
i
glad
to
see
thank
you
i
wanted
to
see
miss
greggory
he
murmured
then
as
the
unconscious
rudeness
of
his
reply
dawned
on
him
he
made
matters
infinitely
worse
by
an
attempted
apology
that
is
i
mean
i
mean
he
began
to
stammer
miserably
some
girls
might
have
tossed
the
floundering
man
a
straw
in
the
shape
of
a
light
laugh
intended
to
turn
aside
all
embarrassment
but
not
billy
billy
held
out
a
frankly
helping
hand
that
was
meant
to
set
the
man
squarely
on
his
feet
at
her
side
mr
arkwright
do
please
she
begged
earnestly
you
and
i
need
to
beat
about
the
bush
i
glad
to
see
you
and
i
hope
glad
to
see
me
we
going
to
be
the
best
of
friends
from
now
on
sure
and
some
day
soon
you
going
to
bring
alice
to
see
me
and
we
have
some
music
i
left
her
she
be
down
at
once
i
dare
say
i
met
rosa
going
up
with
your
card
she
finished
with
a
bright
smile
as
she
turned
and
walked
rapidly
from
the
room
outside
on
the
steps
billy
drew
a
long
breath
there
she
whispered
that
over
and
well
over
the
next
minute
she
frowned
vexedly
she
had
missed
her
glove
never
mind
i
go
back
in
there
for
it
now
anyway
she
decided
in
the
five
minutes
later
alice
greggory
found
only
a
hastily
scrawled
note
waiting
for
her
if
you
forgive
the
unforgivable
she
read
you
forgive
me
for
not
being
here
when
you
come
down
over
which
i
have
no
control
have
called
me
away
may
we
let
it
go
at
that
m
as
alice
greggory
amazed
questioning
eyes
left
the
note
they
fell
upon
the
long
white
glove
on
the
floor
by
the
door
half
mechanically
she
crossed
the
room
and
picked
it
up
but
almost
at
once
she
dropped
it
with
a
low
cry
billy
he
saw
billy
then
a
flood
of
understanding
dyed
her
face
scarlet
as
she
turned
and
fled
to
the
blessedly
unseeing
walls
of
her
own
room
not
ten
minutes
later
rosa
tapped
at
her
door
with
a
note
it
from
arkwright
miss
he
rosa
eyes
were
puzzled
and
a
bit
startled
mr
arkwright
yes
miss
he
come
again
that
is
i
did
know
he
went
but
he
must
have
for
he
come
again
now
he
wrote
something
in
a
little
book
then
he
tore
it
out
and
gave
it
to
me
he
said
he
wait
please
for
an
oh
very
well
miss
greggory
took
the
note
and
spoke
with
an
elaborate
air
of
indifference
that
was
meant
to
express
a
calm
ignoring
of
the
puzzled
questioning
in
the
other
eyes
the
next
moment
she
read
this
in
arkwright
peculiar
scrawl
if
you
already
forgiven
the
unforgivable
you
do
it
again
i
know
and
come
wo
you
please
i
want
to
see
miss
greggory
lifted
her
head
with
a
jerk
her
face
was
a
painful
red
tell
arkwright
i
ca
possibly
she
came
to
an
abrupt
pause
her
eyes
had
encountered
rosa
and
in
rosa
eyes
the
puzzled
questioning
was
plainly
fast
becoming
a
shrewd
suspicion
there
was
the
briefest
of
hesitations
then
lightly
miss
greggory
tossed
the
note
aside
tell
arkwright
i
be
down
at
once
please
she
directed
carelessly
as
she
turned
back
into
the
room
but
she
was
not
down
at
once
she
was
not
down
until
she
had
taken
time
to
bathe
her
red
eyes
powder
her
telltale
nose
smoothe
her
ruffled
hair
and
whip
herself
into
the
calm
young
woman
that
arkwright
finally
rose
to
meet
when
she
came
into
the
room
i
thought
it
was
only
women
who
were
privileged
to
change
their
mind
she
began
brightly
but
arkwright
ignored
her
attempt
to
conventionalize
the
situation
thank
you
for
coming
down
he
said
with
a
weariness
that
instantly
drove
the
forced
smile
from
the
girl
lips
i
i
wanted
to
to
talk
to
yes
she
seated
herself
and
motioned
him
to
a
chair
near
her
he
took
the
seat
and
then
fell
silent
his
eyes
out
the
window
i
thought
you
said
you
you
wanted
to
talk
she
reminded
him
nervously
after
a
minute
i
he
turned
with
disconcerting
abruptness
alice
i
going
to
tell
you
a
i
shall
be
glad
to
listen
people
always
like
stories
do
they
do
they
the
somber
pain
in
arkwright
eyes
deepened
alice
greggory
did
not
know
it
but
he
was
thinking
of
another
story
he
had
once
told
in
that
same
room
billy
was
his
listener
then
while
now
a
little
precipitately
he
began
to
speak
when
i
was
a
very
small
boy
i
went
to
visit
my
uncle
who
in
his
young
days
had
been
quite
a
hunter
before
the
fireplace
in
his
library
was
a
huge
tiger
skin
with
a
particularly
lifelike
head
the
first
time
i
saw
it
i
screamed
and
ran
and
hid
i
refused
then
even
to
go
into
the
room
again
my
cousins
urged
scolded
pleaded
and
laughed
at
me
by
turns
but
i
was
obdurate
i
would
not
go
where
i
could
see
the
fearsome
thing
again
even
though
it
was
as
they
said
but
a
dead
old
rug
finally
one
day
my
uncle
took
a
hand
in
the
matter
by
sheer
he
forced
me
to
go
with
him
straight
up
to
the
dreaded
creature
and
stand
by
its
side
he
laid
one
of
my
shrinking
hands
on
the
beast
smooth
head
and
thrust
the
other
one
quite
into
the
open
red
mouth
with
its
gleaming
teeth
see
he
said
absolutely
nothing
to
fear
he
possibly
hurt
you
just
as
if
you
were
bigger
and
finer
and
stronger
in
every
way
than
that
dead
thing
on
the
floor
then
when
he
had
got
me
to
the
point
where
of
my
own
free
will
i
would
walk
up
and
touch
the
thing
he
drew
a
lesson
for
me
remember
he
charged
me
run
and
hide
again
only
cowards
do
that
walk
straight
up
and
face
the
thing
ten
to
one
you
find
it
nothing
but
a
dead
skin
masquerading
as
the
real
thing
even
if
it
is
if
it
alive
face
it
find
a
weapon
and
fight
it
know
that
you
are
going
to
conquer
it
and
you
conquer
never
run
be
a
man
men
do
run
my
boy
arkwright
paused
and
drew
a
long
breath
he
did
not
look
at
the
girl
in
the
opposite
chair
if
he
had
looked
he
would
have
seen
a
face
transfigured
well
he
resumed
i
never
forgot
that
tiger
skin
nor
what
it
stood
for
after
that
day
when
uncle
ben
thrust
my
hand
into
its
hideous
but
harmless
red
mouth
even
as
a
kid
i
began
then
to
try
not
to
run
i
tried
ever
since
but
i
did
arkwright
voice
had
been
getting
lower
and
lower
the
last
three
words
would
have
been
almost
inaudible
to
ears
less
sensitively
alert
than
were
alice
greggory
for
a
moment
after
the
words
were
uttered
only
the
clock
ticking
broke
the
silence
then
with
an
obvious
effort
the
man
roused
himself
as
if
breaking
away
from
some
benumbing
force
that
held
him
alice
i
do
need
to
tell
you
after
what
i
said
the
other
night
that
i
loved
billy
neilson
that
was
bad
enough
for
i
found
she
was
pledged
to
another
man
but
i
discovered
something
worse
i
discovered
that
i
loved
billy
another
man
wife
and
i
ran
but
i
come
back
i
going
to
face
the
thing
oh
i
not
deceiving
myself
this
love
of
mine
is
no
dead
tiger
skin
it
a
beast
alive
and
alert
god
pity
me
to
destroy
my
very
soul
but
i
going
to
fight
it
and
i
want
you
to
help
the
girl
gave
a
cry
the
man
turned
but
he
could
not
see
her
face
distinctly
twilight
had
come
and
the
room
was
full
of
shadows
he
hesitated
then
went
on
a
little
more
quietly
that
why
i
told
you
all
this
so
you
would
help
me
and
you
will
wo
you
there
was
no
answer
once
again
he
tried
to
see
her
face
but
it
was
turned
now
quite
away
from
him
you
been
a
big
help
already
little
girl
your
friendship
your
comradeship
they
been
everything
to
me
you
not
going
to
make
me
do
without
them
now
no
oh
no
the
answer
was
low
and
a
little
breathless
but
he
heard
it
thank
you
i
knew
you
he
paused
then
rose
to
his
feet
when
he
spoke
again
his
voice
carried
a
note
of
whimsical
lightness
that
was
a
little
forced
but
i
must
go
else
you
take
them
from
me
and
with
good
reason
and
please
do
let
your
kind
heart
grieve
too
much
over
me
i
no
villain
in
a
melodrama
nor
wicked
lover
in
a
novel
you
know
i
just
an
everyday
man
in
real
life
and
we
going
to
fight
this
thing
out
in
everyday
living
that
where
your
help
is
coming
in
we
go
together
to
see
bertram
henshaw
she
asked
us
to
and
you
do
it
i
know
we
have
music
and
everyday
talk
we
see
bertram
henshaw
in
her
own
home
with
her
husband
where
she
belongs
and
i
not
going
to
run
again
but
counting
on
your
help
you
know
he
smiled
a
little
wistfully
as
he
held
out
his
hand
in
one
minute
later
alice
greggory
alone
was
hurrying
i
ca
i
ca
i
know
i
ca
she
was
whispering
wildly
then
in
her
own
room
she
faced
herself
in
the
mirror
yes
you
can
alice
greggory
she
asserted
with
swift
change
of
voice
and
manner
this
is
tiger
skin
and
you
going
to
fight
it
do
you
understand
fight
it
and
you
going
to
win
too
do
you
want
that
man
to
know
you
chapter
vi
the
painting
look
it
was
toward
the
last
of
october
that
billy
began
to
notice
her
husband
growing
restlessness
twice
when
she
had
been
playing
to
him
she
turned
to
find
him
testing
the
suppleness
of
his
injured
arm
several
times
failing
to
receive
an
answer
to
her
questions
she
had
looked
up
to
discover
him
gazing
abstractedly
at
nothing
in
particular
they
read
and
walked
and
talked
together
to
be
sure
and
devotion
to
her
lightest
wish
was
beyond
question
but
more
and
more
frequently
these
days
billy
found
him
hovering
over
his
sketches
in
his
studio
and
once
when
he
failed
to
respond
to
the
search
revealed
him
buried
in
a
profound
treatise
on
the
art
of
then
came
the
day
when
billy
after
an
hour
vain
effort
to
imprison
within
notes
a
tantalizing
melody
captured
the
truant
and
rain
down
to
the
studio
to
tell
bertram
of
her
victory
but
bertram
did
not
seem
even
to
hear
her
true
he
leaped
to
his
feet
and
hurried
to
meet
her
his
face
radiantly
aglow
but
she
had
not
ceased
to
speak
before
he
himself
was
talking
billy
billy
i
been
sketching
he
cried
my
hand
is
almost
steady
see
some
of
those
lines
are
all
right
i
just
picked
up
a
crayon
and
he
stopped
abruptly
his
eyes
on
billy
face
a
vaguely
troubled
shadow
crossed
his
own
did
did
you
were
you
saying
anything
in
in
particular
when
you
came
in
he
stammered
for
a
short
billy
looked
at
her
husband
without
speaking
then
a
little
queerly
she
laughed
oh
no
nothing
at
all
in
she
retorted
airily
the
next
moment
with
one
of
her
unexpected
changes
of
manner
she
darted
across
the
room
picked
up
a
palette
and
a
handful
of
brushes
from
the
long
box
near
it
advancing
toward
her
husband
she
held
them
out
dramatically
and
now
paint
my
lord
paint
she
commanded
him
with
stern
insistence
as
she
thrust
them
into
his
hands
bertram
laughed
shamefacedly
oh
i
say
billy
he
began
but
billy
had
gone
out
in
the
hall
billy
was
speeding
talking
fiercely
to
herself
we
billy
neilson
henshaw
it
come
now
behave
yourself
was
the
painting
look
you
know
what
that
means
remember
he
belongs
to
his
art
before
he
does
to
you
kate
and
everybody
says
so
and
you
you
expected
him
to
tend
to
you
and
your
silly
little
songs
do
you
want
to
ruin
his
career
as
if
now
he
could
spend
all
his
time
and
give
all
his
thoughts
to
you
but
i
i
just
hate
that
art
what
did
you
say
billy
asked
william
in
mild
surprise
coming
around
the
turn
of
the
balustrade
in
the
hall
above
were
you
speaking
to
me
my
dear
billy
looked
up
her
face
cleared
suddenly
and
she
laughed
though
a
little
ruefully
no
uncle
william
i
was
talking
to
you
she
sighed
i
was
just
just
administering
first
aid
to
the
injured
she
finished
as
she
whisked
into
her
own
room
well
well
bless
the
child
what
can
she
mean
by
that
puzzled
uncle
william
turning
to
go
down
the
stairway
bertram
began
to
paint
a
very
little
the
next
day
he
painted
still
more
the
next
and
yet
more
again
the
day
following
he
was
like
a
bird
let
out
of
a
cage
so
joyously
alive
was
he
the
old
sparkle
came
back
to
his
eye
the
old
gay
smile
to
his
lips
now
that
they
had
come
back
billy
realized
what
she
had
not
been
conscious
of
before
that
for
several
weeks
past
they
had
not
been
there
and
she
wondered
which
hurt
the
more
that
they
had
not
been
there
before
or
that
they
were
there
now
then
she
scolded
herself
roundly
for
asking
the
question
at
all
they
were
not
easy
those
days
for
billy
though
always
to
bertram
she
managed
to
show
a
cheerfully
serene
face
to
uncle
william
also
and
to
aunt
hannah
she
showed
a
smiling
countenance
and
because
she
could
not
talk
to
anybody
else
of
her
feelings
she
talked
to
herself
this
however
was
no
new
thing
for
billy
to
do
from
earliest
childhood
she
had
fought
things
out
in
like
manner
but
it
so
absurd
of
you
billy
henshaw
she
berated
herself
one
day
when
bertram
had
become
so
absorbed
in
his
work
that
he
had
forgotten
to
keep
his
appointment
with
her
for
a
walk
just
because
you
have
had
his
constant
attention
almost
every
hour
since
you
were
married
is
no
reason
why
you
should
have
it
every
hour
now
when
his
arm
is
better
besides
it
exactly
what
you
said
you
would
do
object
to
his
giving
proper
time
to
his
but
i
not
objecting
stormed
the
other
half
of
herself
him
to
do
it
it
only
that
he
so
so
to
do
it
he
does
seem
to
mind
a
bit
being
away
from
me
he
actually
happy
well
do
you
want
him
to
be
happy
in
his
work
fie
for
shame
a
fine
artist
wife
you
are
it
seems
kate
was
right
then
you
going
to
spoil
his
career
ho
quoth
billy
and
tossed
her
head
forthwith
she
crossed
the
room
to
her
piano
and
plumped
herself
down
hard
on
to
the
stool
then
from
under
her
fingers
there
fell
a
rollicking
melody
that
seemed
to
fill
the
room
with
little
dancing
feet
faster
and
faster
sped
billy
fingers
swifter
and
swifter
twinkled
the
little
dancing
feet
then
a
door
was
jerked
open
and
bertram
voice
called
billy
the
music
stopped
instantly
billy
sprang
from
her
seat
her
eyes
eagerly
seeking
the
direction
from
which
had
come
the
voice
perhaps
bertram
wanted
her
perhaps
he
was
not
going
to
paint
any
longer
that
morning
after
all
billy
called
the
voice
again
please
do
you
mind
stopping
that
playing
just
for
a
little
while
a
brute
i
know
dear
but
my
brush
try
to
keep
time
with
that
crazy
little
tune
of
yours
and
you
know
my
hand
is
none
too
steady
anyhow
and
when
it
tries
to
keep
up
with
that
jiggety
jig
jig
jiggety
jig
jig
you
mind
darling
just
just
sewing
or
doing
something
still
for
a
while
all
the
light
fled
from
billy
face
but
her
voice
when
she
spoke
was
the
quintessence
of
cheery
indifference
why
no
of
course
not
thank
you
i
knew
you
would
sighed
bertram
then
the
door
shut
for
a
long
minute
billy
stood
motionless
before
she
glanced
at
her
watch
and
sped
to
the
telephone
is
miss
greggory
there
rosa
she
called
when
the
operator
ring
was
answered
mis
greggory
the
lame
one
no
greggory
miss
oh
then
wo
you
ask
her
to
come
to
the
telephone
there
was
a
moment
wait
during
which
billy
small
foot
beat
a
nervous
tattoo
on
the
floor
oh
is
that
you
alice
she
called
then
are
you
going
to
be
home
for
an
hour
or
two
why

arkwright

then
i
wo
yes
i
will
billy
spoke
with
renewed
firmness
i
be
there
right
away
and
she
hung
up
the
receiver
and
went
to
tell
pete
to
order
john
and
peggy
at
once
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
left
alice
and
arkwright
alone
together
muttered
the
young
wife
feverishly
as
she
hurriedly
prepared
for
departure
but
i
make
it
up
to
them
later
i
going
to
give
them
lots
of
chances
but
i
just
had
to
go
somewhere
at
the
annex
with
alice
greggory
and
arkwright
billy
sang
duets
and
trios
and
reveled
in
a
sonorous
wilderness
of
new
music
to
her
content
then
rested
refreshed
and
at
peace
with
all
the
world
she
hurried
home
to
dinner
and
to
bertram
there
i
feel
better
she
sighed
as
she
took
off
her
hat
in
her
own
room
and
now
i
go
find
bertram
bless
his
heart
of
course
he
did
want
me
to
play
when
he
was
so
busy
billy
went
straight
to
the
studio
but
bertram
was
not
there
neither
was
he
in
william
room
nor
anywhere
in
the
house
in
the
pete
was
found
looking
rather
white
leaning
back
in
a
chair
he
struggled
at
once
to
his
feet
however
as
his
mistress
entered
the
room
billy
hurried
forward
with
a
startled
exclamation
why
pete
what
is
it
are

sick
she
cried
her
glance
encompassing
the
table
no
oh

the
old
man
stumbled
forward
and
began
to
arrange
the
knives
and
forks
it
just
a
pesky
pain
beggin
yer
pardon
in
my
side
but

billy
frowned
and
shook
her
head
her
eyes
were
on
pete
palpably
trembling
hands
but
pete
you
are
sick
she
protested
let
eliza

pete
drew
himself
stiffly
erect
the
color
had
begun
to
come
back
to
his
face
there
hai
no
one
set
this
table
much
but
me
for
fifty
years

i

sort
of
notion

backbone

out
o
my
knees

double
up
so
i

there

i
pert
as
a
sparrer
now
and
with
stiff
celerity
pete
resumed
his
task
his
mistress
still
frowned
that
is
right
pete
she
demurred
with
a
slow
shake
of
her
head
you
should
see
a
the
old
man
paled
a
little
he
had
seen
a
doctor
and
he
had
not
liked
what
the
doctor
had
told
him
in
fact
he
stubbornly
refused
to
believe
what
the
doctor
had
said
he
straightened
himself
now
a
little
aggressively
humph
beggin
yer
pardon
miss
but
i
do
think
much
o
them
doctor
billy
shook
her
head
again
as
she
smiled
and
turned
away
then
as
if
casually
she
asked
oh
did
bertram
go
out
pete
yes
miss
about
five
he
said
he
be
back
to
oh
all
from
the
hall
the
telephone
jangled
sharply
i
go
said
pete
mistress
as
she
turned
and
hurried
it
was
bertram
voice
that
answered
her
opening
oh
billy
is
that
you
dear
well
you
just
the
one
i
wanted
i
wanted
to
say
that
is
i
wanted
to
ask
you
the
speaker
cleared
his
throat
a
little
nervously
and
began
all
over
again
the
fact
is
billy
i
run
across
a
couple
of
old
classmates
on
from
new
york
and
they
are
very
anxious
i
should
stay
down
to
dinner
with
them
would
you
mind
very
much
if
i
did
a
cold
hand
seemed
to
clutch
billy
heart
she
caught
her
breath
with
a
little
gasp
and
tried
to
speak
but
she
had
to
try
twice
before
the
words
came
why
no
no
of
course
not
billy
voice
was
very
and
a
little
shaky
but
it
was
surpassingly
cheerful
you
sure
you
wo
be
lonesome
bertram
voice
was
vaguely
troubled
of
course
not
you
only
to
say
the
word
little
girl
came
bertram
anxious
tones
again
and
i
wo
billy
swallowed
convulsively
if
only
only
he
would
and
leave
her
to
herself
as
if
she
were
going
to
own
up
that
was
lonesome
for
if
was
not
lonesome
for
nonsense
of
course
you
stay
called
billy
still
in
that
shaky
treble
then
before
bertram
could
answer
she
uttered
a
gay
and
hung
up
the
receiver
billy
had
ten
whole
minutes
in
which
to
cry
before
pete
gong
sounded
for
dinner
but
she
had
only
one
minute
in
which
to
try
to
efface
the
woefully
visible
effects
of
those
ten
minutes
before
william
tapped
at
her
door
and
called
gone
to
sleep
my
dear
dinner
ready
did
you
hear
the
gong
yes
i
coming
uncle
billy
spoke
with
breezy
gayety
and
threw
open
the
door
but
she
did
not
meet
uncle
william
eyes
her
head
was
turned
away
her
hands
were
fussing
with
the
hang
of
her
skirt
bertram
dining
out
pete
tells
me
observed
william
with
cheerful
nonchalance
as
they
went
together
billy
bit
her
lip
and
looked
up
sharply
she
had
been
bracing
herself
to
meet
with
disdainful
indifference
this
man
pity
the
pity
due
a
poor
neglected
wife
whose
husband
to
dine
with
old
classmates
rather
than
with
herself
now
she
found
in
william
face
not
pity
but
a
calm
even
jovial
acceptance
of
the
situation
as
a
matter
of
course
she
had
known
she
was
going
to
hate
that
pity
but
now
curiously
enough
she
was
conscious
only
of
anger
that
the
pity
was
not
there
that
she
might
hate
it
she
tossed
her
head
a
little
so
even
william
uncle
william
regarded
this
monstrous
thing
as
an
insignificant
matter
of
everyday
experience
maybe
he
expected
it
to
occur
frequently
every
night
or
so
doubtless
he
did
expect
it
to
occur
every
night
or
so
indeed
very
well
as
if
she
were
going
to
show
that
she
cared
whether
bertram
were
there
or
not
they
should
see
so
with
head
held
high
and
eyes
asparkle
billy
marched
into
the
and
took
her
accustomed
place
chapter
vii
the
big
bad
quarrel
it
was
a
brilliant
dinner
because
billy
made
it
so
at
first
william
met
her
sallies
of
wit
with
mild
surprise
but
it
was
not
long
before
he
rose
gallantly
to
the
occasion
and
gave
back
full
measure
of
retort
even
pete
twice
had
to
turn
his
back
to
hide
a
smile
and
once
his
hand
shook
so
that
the
tea
he
was
carrying
almost
spilled
this
threatened
catastrophe
however
seemed
to
frighten
him
so
much
that
his
face
was
very
grave
throughout
the
rest
of
the
dinner
still
laughing
and
talking
gayly
billy
and
uncle
william
after
the
meal
was
over
ascended
to
the
there
however
the
man
in
spite
of
the
young
woman
gay
badinage
fell
to
dozing
in
the
big
chair
before
the
fire
leaving
billy
with
only
spunkie
for
company
spunkie
who
disdaining
every
effort
to
entice
her
into
a
romp
only
winked
and
blinked
stupid
eyes
and
finally
curled
herself
on
the
rug
for
a
nap
billy
left
to
her
own
devices
glanced
at
her
watch
seven
time
almost
for
bertram
to
be
coming
he
had
said
dinner
and
of
course
after
dinner
was
over
he
would
be
coming
home
to
her
very
well
she
would
show
him
that
she
had
at
least
got
along
without
him
as
well
as
he
had
without
her
at
all
events
he
would
not
find
her
forlornly
sitting
with
her
nose
pressed
against
the
and
forthwith
billy
established
herself
in
a
big
chair
with
its
back
carefully
turned
toward
the
door
by
which
bertram
would
enter
and
opened
a
book
five
ten
fifteen
minutes
passed
billy
fidgeted
in
her
chair
twisted
her
neck
to
look
out
into
the
hall
and
dropped
her
book
with
a
bang
uncle
william
jerked
himself
awake
and
spunkie
opened
sleepy
eyes
then
both
settled
themselves
for
another
nap
billy
sighed
picked
up
her
book
and
flounced
back
into
her
chair
but
she
did
not
read
disconsolately
she
sat
staring
straight
ahead
until
a
quick
step
on
the
sidewalk
outside
stirred
her
into
instant
action
assuming
a
look
of
absorbed
interest
she
twitched
the
book
open
and
held
it
before
her
face
but
the
step
passed
by
the
door
and
billy
saw
then
that
her
book
was
upside
down
five
ten
fifteen
more
minutes
passed
billy
still
sat
apparently
reading
though
she
had
not
turned
a
page
the
book
now
however
was
right
side
up
one
by
one
other
minutes
passed
till
the
great
clock
in
the
hall
struck
nine
long
strokes
well
well
bless
my
soul
mumbled
uncle
william
resolutely
forcing
himself
to
wake
up
what
time
was
that
nine
billy
spoke
with
tragic
distinctness
yet
very
cheerfully
eh
only
nine
blinked
uncle
william
i
thought
it
must
be
ten
well
anyhow
i
believe
i
go
i
seem
to
be
unusually
billy
said
nothing
nine
indeed
she
was
thinking
wrathfully
at
the
door
uncle
william
turned
you
not
going
to
sit
up
my
dear
of
course
he
remarked
for
the
second
time
that
evening
a
cold
hand
seemed
to
clutch
heart
up
had
it
come
already
to
that
was
she
even
now
a
wife
who
had
need
to
for
her
husband
i
really
would
my
dear
advised
uncle
william
again
good
oh
but
i
not
sleepy
at
all
yet
billy
managed
to
declare
brightly
good
then
uncle
william
went
billy
turned
to
her
book
which
happened
to
be
one
of
william
on
fake
collect
anything
these
days
requires
expert
knowledge
and
the
utmost
care
and
discrimination
read
billy
eyes
so
uncle
william
bertram
was
going
to
spend
the
whole
evening
as
well
as
stay
to
dinner
ran
billy
thoughts
enormous
quantity
of
bijouterie
dresden
and
battersea
enamel
ware
that
is
now
flooding
the
market
is
made
on
the
continent
and
made
chiefly
for
the
american
trade
continued
the
book
well
who
cares
if
it
is
snapped
billy
springing
to
her
feet
and
tossing
the
volume
aside
spunkie
come
here
you
simply
got
to
play
with
me
do
you
hear
i
want
to
be
gay
gay
he
gay

those
men
where

want
him
to
come

and

over

old
book

to
have
him
find
me
gay
too
now
come
spunkie
hurry
wake
up
he

here
right
away
i
and
billy
shook
a
pair
of
worsted
reins
hung
with
little
soft
balls
full
in
spunkie
face
but
spunkie
would
not
wake
up
and
spunkie
would
not
play
she
pretended
to
she
bit
at
the
reins
and
sank
her
sharp
claws
into
the
dangling
balls
for
a
fleeting
instant
even
something
like
mischief
gleamed
in
her
big
yellow
eyes
then
the
jaws
relaxed
the
paws
turned
to
velvet
and
spunkie
sleek
gray
head
settled
slowly
back
into
lazy
comfort
spunkie
was
asleep
billy
gazed
at
the
cat
with
reproachful
eyes
and
you
too
spunkie
she
murmured
then
she
got
to
her
feet
and
went
back
to
her
chair
this
time
she
picked
up
a
magazine
and
began
to
turn
the
leaves
very
fast
one
after
another
nine
came
then
ten
pete
appeared
at
the
door
to
get
spunkie
and
to
see
that
everything
was
all
right
for
the
night
mr
bertram
is
not
in
yet
he
began
doubtfully
billy
shook
her
head
with
a
bright
smile
no
pete
go
to
bed
i
expect
him
every
minute
good
thank
you
good
the
old
man
picked
up
the
sleepy
cat
and
went
a
little
later
billy
heard
his
quiet
steps
coming
back
through
the
hall
and
ascending
the
stairs
she
listened
until
from
away
at
the
top
of
the
house
she
heard
his
door
close
then
she
drew
a
long
breath
ten
after
ten
and
bertram
not
there
yet
and
was
this
what
he
called
dinner
did
one
eat
then
till
ten
when
one
dined
with
one
friends
billy
was
angry
now
very
angry
she
was
too
angry
to
be
reasonable
this
thing
that
her
husband
had
done
seemed
monstrous
to
her
smarting
as
she
was
under
the
sting
of
hurt
pride
and
grieved
loneliness
the
state
of
mind
into
which
she
had
worked
herself
no
longer
now
did
she
wish
to
be
gay
when
her
husband
came
no
longer
did
she
even
pretend
to
assume
indifference
bertram
had
done
wrong
he
had
been
unkind
cruel
thoughtless
inconsiderate
of
her
comfort
and
happiness
furthermore
he
love
her
as
well
as
she
did
him
or
he
never
never
could
have
done
it
she
would
let
him
see
when
he
came
just
how
hurt
and
grieved
she
was
and
how
disappointed
too
billy
was
walking
the
floor
now
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
ten
came
then
eleven
as
the
eleven
long
strokes
reverberated
through
the
silent
house
billy
drew
in
her
breath
and
held
it
suspended
a
new
look
came
to
her
eyes
a
growing
terror
crept
into
them
and
culminated
in
a
frightened
stare
at
the
clock
billy
ran
then
to
the
great
outer
door
and
pulled
it
open
a
cold
wind
stung
her
face
and
caused
her
to
shut
the
door
quickly
back
and
forth
she
began
to
pace
the
floor
again
but
in
five
minutes
she
had
run
to
the
door
once
more
this
time
she
wore
a
heavy
coat
of
bertram
which
she
caught
up
as
she
passed
the
out
on
to
the
broad
top
step
billy
hurried
and
peered
down
the
street
as
far
as
she
could
see
not
a
person
was
in
sight
across
the
street
in
the
public
garden
the
wind
stirred
the
gray
and
set
them
to
casting
weird
shadows
on
the
bare
frozen
ground
a
warning
something
behind
her
sent
billy
scurrying
into
the
house
just
in
time
to
prevent
the
heavy
door
closing
and
shutting
her
out
keyless
in
the
cold
eleven
came
and
again
billy
ran
to
the
door
this
time
she
put
the
against
the
casing
so
that
the
door
could
not
close
once
more
she
peered
wildly
up
and
down
the
street
and
across
into
the
deserted
garden
there
was
only
terror
now
in
billy
face
the
anger
was
all
gone
in
billy
mind
there
was
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
something
had
happened
to
bertram
bertram
was
ill
hurt
dead
and
he
was
so
good
so
kind
so
noble
such
a
dear
dear
husband
if
only
she
could
see
him
once
if
only
she
could
ask
his
forgiveness
for
those
wicked
unkind
accusing
thoughts
if
only
she
could
tell
him
again
that
she
did
love
him
if
only
far
down
the
street
a
step
rang
sharply
on
the
frosty
air
a
masculine
figure
was
hurrying
toward
the
house
retreating
well
into
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
billy
watched
it
her
heart
pounding
against
her
side
in
great
suffocating
throbs
nearer
and
nearer
strode
the
approaching
figure
until
billy
had
almost
sprung
to
meet
it
with
a
glad
cry
almost
but
not
quite
for
the
figure
neither
turned
nor
paused
but
marched
straight
on
and
billy
saw
then
under
the
arc
light
a
man
who
was
not
bertram
at
all
three
times
during
the
next
few
minutes
did
the
waiting
little
bride
on
the
doorstep
watch
with
palpitating
yearning
a
shadowy
form
appear
approach
and
pass
by
at
the
third
disappointment
billy
wrung
her
hands
helplessly
i
do
see
how
there
can
be
so
many
utterly
people
in
the
world
she
choked
then
thoroughly
chilled
and
sick
at
heart
she
went
into
the
house
and
closed
the
door
once
again
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
billy
took
up
her
weary
vigil
she
still
wore
the
heavy
coat
she
had
forgotten
to
take
it
off
her
face
was
pitifully
white
and
drawn
her
eyes
were
wild
one
of
her
hands
was
nervously
caressing
the
rough
sleeve
of
the
coat
as
it
hung
from
her
shoulder
one
two
three
billy
gave
a
sharp
cry
and
ran
into
the
hall
yes
it
was
twelve
and
now
always
all
the
rest
of
the
dreary
useless
hours
that
that
clock
would
tick
away
through
an
endless
existence
she
would
have
to
live
without
bertram
if
only
she
could
see
him
once
more
but
she
could
not
he
was
dead
he
must
be
dead
now
here
it
was
twelve
and
there
came
a
quick
step
the
click
of
a
key
in
the
lock
then
the
door
swung
back
and
bertram
big
strong
and
stood
before
her
well
well
hullo
he
called
jovially
why
billy
what
the
matter
he
broke
off
in
quite
a
different
tone
of
voice
and
then
a
curious
thing
happened
billy
who
a
minute
before
had
been
seeing
only
a
dear
noble
adorable
bertram
saw
now
suddenly
only
the
man
that
had
stayed
till
midnight
with
two
friends
while
she
she
matter
matter
exclaimed
billy
sharply
then
is
this
what
you
call
staying
to
dinner
bertram
henshaw
bertram
stared
a
slow
red
stole
to
his
forehead
it
was
his
first
experience
of
coming
home
to
meet
angry
eyes
that
questioned
his
behavior
and
he
did
not
like
it
he
had
been
perhaps
a
little
when
he
saw
how
late
he
had
stayed
and
he
had
intended
to
say
he
was
sorry
of
course
but
to
be
thus
sharply
called
to
account
for
a
perfectly
innocent
good
time
with
a
couple
of
friends
to
come
home
and
find
billy
making
a
ridiculous
scene
like
this
he
he
would
not
stand
for
it
he
bertram
lips
snapped
open
the
angry
retort
was
almost
spoken
when
something
in
the
piteously
quivering
chin
and
white
drawn
face
opposite
stopped
it
just
in
time
why
billy
darling
he
murmured
instead
it
was
billy
turn
to
change
all
the
anger
melted
away
before
the
dismayed
tenderness
in
those
dear
eyes
and
the
grieved
hurt
in
that
dear
voice
well
you
you
i
billy
began
to
cry
it
was
all
right
then
of
course
for
the
next
minute
she
was
crying
on
bertram
big
broad
shoulder
and
in
the
midst
of
broken
words
kisses
gentle
pats
and
inarticulate
croonings
the
big
bad
quarrel
that
had
been
all
ready
to
materialize
faded
quite
away
into
nothingness
i
did
have
such
an
awfully
good
time
anyhow
avowed
bertram
when
speech
became
rational
i
rather
have
been
home
with
nonsense
blinked
billy
valiantly
of
course
you
had
a
good
time
and
it
was
perfectly
right
you
should
have
it
too
and
i
i
hope
have
it
i
emphasized
bertram
promptly
not
and
leave
you
billy
regarded
him
with
adoring
eyes
i
tell
you
we
have
come
here
she
proposed
gayly
sure
we
will
agreed
bertram
yes
sure
we
will
echoed
billy
with
a
contented
sigh
then
a
little
breathlessly
she
added
anyhow
i
know
where
you
are
i
think
you
dead
you
blessed
scolded
bertram
punctuating
each
word
with
a
kiss
billy
drew
a
long
sigh
if
this
is
a
quarrel
i
going
to
have
them
often
she
announced
placidly
billy
the
young
husband
was
plainly
aghast
well
i
am
because
i
like
the
dimpled
billy
with
a
mischievous
twinkle
as
she
broke
from
his
clasp
and
skipped
ahead
up
the
stairway
chapter
viii
billy
cultivates
a
comfortable
indifference
the
next
morning
under
the
uncompromising
challenge
of
a
bright
sun
billy
began
to
be
uneasily
suspicious
that
she
had
been
just
a
bit
unreasonable
and
exacting
the
night
before
to
make
matters
worse
she
chanced
to
run
across
a
newspaper
criticism
of
a
new
book
bearing
the
ominous
title
when
the
honeymoon
wanes
a
talk
to
young
such
a
title
of
course
attracted
her
supersensitive
attention
at
once
and
with
a
curiously
faint
feeling
she
picked
up
the
paper
and
began
to
read
as
the
most
of
the
criticism
was
taken
up
with
quotations
from
the
book
it
was
such
sentences
as
these
that
met
her
startled
eyes
perhaps
the
first
test
comes
when
the
young
wife
awakes
to
the
realization
that
while
her
husband
loves
her
very
much
he
can
still
make
plans
with
his
old
friends
which
do
not
include
herself
then
is
when
the
foolish
wife
lets
her
husband
see
how
hurt
she
is
that
he
can
want
to
be
with
any
one
but
herself
then
is
when
the
husband
used
all
his
life
to
independence
perhaps
begins
to
chafe
under
these
new
bonds
that
hold
him
so
fast
no
man
likes
to
be
held
up
at
the
end
of
a
threatened
scene
and
made
to
give
an
account
of
himself
before
a
woman
has
learned
to
cultivate
a
comfortable
indifference
to
her
husband
comings
and
goings
she
is
apt
to
be
tyrannical
and
indifference
indeed
stormed
billy
to
herself
as
if
i
ever
could
be
comfortably
indifferent
to
anything
bertram
did
she
dropped
the
paper
but
there
were
still
other
quotations
from
the
book
there
she
knew
and
in
a
moment
she
was
back
at
the
table
reading
them
no
man
however
fondly
he
loves
his
wife
likes
to
feel
that
she
is
everlastingly
peering
into
the
recesses
of
his
mind
and
weighing
his
every
act
to
find
out
if
he
does
or
does
not
love
her
as
well
as
he
did
yesterday
at
this
time
then
when
spontaneity
is
dead
she
is
the
chief
mourner
at
its
funeral
a
few
couples
never
leave
the
garden
of
eden
they
grow
old
hand
in
hand
they
are
the
ones
who
bear
and
forbear
who
have
learned
to
adjust
themselves
to
the
intimate
relationship
of
living
together
a
certain
amount
of
liberty
both
of
action
and
thought
must
be
allowed
on
each
side
the
family
shut
in
upon
itself
grows
so
narrow
that
all
interest
in
the
outside
world
is
lost
no
two
people
are
ever
fitted
to
fill
each
other
lives
entirely
they
ought
not
to
try
to
do
it
if
they
do
try
the
process
is
belittling
to
each
and
the
result
if
it
is
successful
is
nothing
less
than
a
tragedy
for
it
could
not
mean
the
highest
ideals
nor
the
truest
devotion
brushing
up
against
other
interests
and
other
personalities
is
good
for
both
husband
and
wife
then
to
each
other
they
bring
the
best
of
what
they
have
found
and
each
to
the
other
continues
to
be
new
and
interesting
the
young
wife
however
is
apt
to
be
jealous
of
everything
that
turns
her
husband
attention
for
one
moment
away
from
herself
she
is
jealous
of
his
thoughts
his
words
his
friends
even
his
business
but
the
wife
who
has
learned
to
be
the
clinging
vine
when
her
husband
wishes
her
to
cling
and
to
be
the
sturdy
oak
when
clinging
vines
would
be
tiresome
has
solved
a
tremendous
at
this
point
billy
dropped
the
paper
she
flung
it
down
indeed
a
bit
angrily
there
were
still
a
few
more
words
in
the
criticism
mostly
the
critic
own
opinion
of
the
book
but
billy
did
not
care
for
this
she
had
read
quite
enough
boo
much
in
fact
all
that
sort
of
talk
might
be
very
well
even
necessary
perhaps
she
told
herself
for
ordinary
husbands
and
wives
but
for
her
and
bertram
then
vividly
before
her
rose
those
initial
quoted
words
perhaps
the
first
test
comes
when
the
young
wife
awakes
to
the
realization
that
while
her
husband
loves
her
very
much
he
can
still
make
plans
with
his
old
friends
which
do
not
include
billy
frowned
and
put
her
finger
to
her
lips
was
that
then
last
night
a
test
had
she
been
tyrannical
and
exacting
was
she
everlastingly
peering
into
the
recesses
of
bertram
mind
and
weighing
his
every
act
was
bertram
already
beginning
to
chafe
under
these
new
bonds
that
held
him
no
no
never
that
she
could
not
believe
that
but
what
if
he
should
sometime
begin
to
chafe
what
if
they
two
should
in
days
to
come
degenerate
into
just
the
ordinary
everyday
married
folk
whom
she
saw
about
her
everywhere
and
for
whom
just
such
horrid
books
as
this
must
be
written
it
was
unbelievable
unthinkable
and
yet
that
man
had
said
with
a
despairing
sigh
billy
picked
up
the
paper
once
more
and
read
carefully
every
word
again
when
she
had
finished
she
stood
soberly
thoughtful
her
eyes
out
of
the
window
after
all
it
was
nothing
but
the
same
old
story
she
was
exacting
she
did
want
her
husband
every
thought
she
in
peering
into
every
last
recess
of
his
mind
if
she
had
half
a
chance
she
was
jealous
of
his
work
she
had
almost
hated
his
painting
at
times
she
had
held
him
up
with
a
threatened
scene
only
the
night
before
and
demanded
that
he
should
give
an
account
of
himself
she
had
very
likely
been
the
clinging
vine
when
she
should
have
been
the
sturdy
oak
very
well
then
billy
lifted
her
head
and
threw
back
her
shoulders
he
should
have
no
further
cause
for
complaint
she
would
be
an
oak
she
would
cultivate
that
comfortable
indifference
to
his
comings
and
goings
she
would
brush
up
against
other
interests
and
personalities
so
as
to
be
new
and
interesting
to
her
husband
she
would
not
be
tyrannical
exacting
or
jealous
she
would
not
threaten
scenes
nor
peer
into
recesses
whatever
happened
she
would
not
let
bertram
begin
to
chafe
against
those
bonds
having
arrived
at
this
heroic
and
to
her
eminently
satisfactory
state
of
mind
billy
turned
from
the
window
and
fell
to
work
on
a
piece
of
manuscript
music
up
against
other
interests
she
admonished
herself
sternly
as
she
reached
for
her
pen
theoretically
it
was
beautiful
but
practically
billy
began
at
once
to
be
that
oak
not
an
hour
after
she
had
first
seen
the
fateful
notice
of
when
the
honeymoon
wanes
bertram
ring
sounded
at
the
door
bertram
always
let
himself
in
with
his
latchkey
but
from
the
first
of
billy
being
there
he
had
given
a
peculiar
ring
at
the
bell
which
would
bring
his
wife
flying
to
welcome
him
if
she
were
anywhere
in
the
house
when
the
bell
sounded
billy
sprang
as
usual
to
her
feet
with
a
joyous
there
bertram
but
the
next
moment
she
fell
back
tut
tut
billy
neilson
henshaw
learn
to
cultivate
a
comfortable
indifference
to
your
husband
comings
and
goings
she
whispered
fiercely
then
she
sat
down
and
fell
to
work
again
a
moment
later
she
heard
her
husband
voice
talking
to
some
one
pete
she
surmised
here
you
say
she
here
then
she
heard
bertram
quick
step
on
the
stairs
the
next
minute
very
quietly
he
came
to
her
door
ho
he
ejaculated
gayly
as
she
rose
to
receive
his
kiss
i
thought
i
find
you
asleep
when
you
did
hear
my
billy
reddened
a
little
oh
no
i
was
but
you
did
hear
bertram
stopped
abruptly
an
odd
look
in
his
eyes
maybe
you
did
hear
it
though
he
corrected
billy
colored
more
confusedly
the
fact
that
she
looked
so
distressed
did
not
tend
to
clear
bertram
face
why
of
course
billy
i
did
mean
to
insist
on
your
coming
to
meet
me
he
began
a
little
stiffly
but
billy
interrupted
him
why
bertram
i
just
love
to
go
to
meet
you
she
maintained
indignantly
then
remembering
just
in
time
she
amended
that
is
i
did
love
to
meet
you
until
with
a
sudden
realization
that
she
certainly
had
not
helped
matters
any
she
came
to
an
embarrassed
pause
a
puzzled
frown
showed
on
bertram
face
you
did
love
to
meet
me
until
he
repeated
after
her
then
his
face
changed
billy
you
are
you
be
laying
up
last
night
against
me
he
reproached
her
a
little
irritably
last
night
why
of
course
not
retorted
billy
in
a
panic
at
the
bare
mention
of
the
test
which
according
to
when
the
honeymoon
wanes
was
at
the
root
of
all
her
misery
already
she
thought
she
detected
in
bertram
voice
signs
that
he
was
beginning
to
chafe
against
those
it
is
a
matter
of
of
the
utmost
indifference
to
me
what
time
you
come
home
at
night
my
dear
she
finished
airily
as
she
sat
down
to
her
work
again
bertram
stared
then
he
frowned
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
the
room
bertram
who
knew
nothing
of
the
talk
to
young
wives
in
the
newspaper
at
billy
feet
was
surprised
puzzled
and
just
a
bit
angry
billy
left
alone
jabbed
her
pen
with
such
force
against
her
paper
that
the
note
she
was
making
became
an
unsightly
blot
well
if
this
is
what
that
man
calls
being
indifferent
i
hate
to
try
the
kind
she
muttered
with
emphasis
chapter
ix
the
dinner
billy
tried
to
get
notwithstanding
what
billy
was
disposed
to
regard
as
the
of
her
first
attempt
to
profit
by
the
talk
to
young
wives
she
still
frantically
tried
to
avert
the
waning
of
her
honeymoon
assiduously
she
cultivated
the
prescribed
indifference
and
with
at
least
apparent
enthusiasm
she
sought
the
outside
that
is
she
did
all
this
when
she
thought
of
it
when
something
reminded
her
of
the
sword
of
destruction
hanging
over
her
happiness
at
other
times
when
she
was
just
being
happy
without
question
she
was
her
old
self
impulsive
affectionate
and
altogether
adorable
naturally
under
these
circumstances
her
conduct
was
somewhat
erratic
for
three
days
perhaps
she
would
fly
to
the
door
at
her
ring
and
hang
upon
his
every
movement
then
for
the
next
three
she
would
be
a
veritable
for
elusiveness
caring
apparently
not
one
whit
whether
her
husband
came
or
went
until
poor
bertram
at
his
wit
end
scourged
himself
with
a
merciless
catechism
as
to
what
he
had
done
to
vex
her
then
perhaps
just
when
he
had
nerved
himself
almost
to
the
point
of
asking
her
what
was
the
trouble
there
would
come
another
change
bringing
back
to
him
the
old
billy
joyous
winsome
and
devoted
plainly
caring
nothing
for
anybody
or
anything
but
himself
scarcely
however
would
he
become
sure
that
it
was
his
billy
back
again
before
she
was
off
once
more
quite
beyond
his
reach
singing
with
arkwright
and
alice
greggory
playing
with
tommy
dunn
plunging
into
some
club
or
church
work
anything
but
being
with
him
that
all
this
was
puzzling
and
disquieting
to
bertram
billy
not
once
suspected
billy
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
was
but
cultivating
a
comfortable
indifference
brushing
up
against
outside
interests
and
being
an
oak
december
passed
and
january
came
bringing
miss
marguerite
winthrop
to
her
boston
home
bertram
arm
was
as
good
as
ever
now
according
to
its
owner
and
the
sittings
for
the
new
portrait
began
at
once
this
left
billy
even
more
to
her
own
devices
for
bertram
entered
into
his
new
work
with
an
enthusiasm
born
of
a
glad
relief
from
forced
idleness
and
a
consuming
eagerness
to
prove
that
even
though
he
had
failed
the
first
time
he
could
paint
a
portrait
of
marguerite
winthrop
that
would
be
a
credit
to
himself
a
conclusive
retort
to
his
critics
and
a
source
of
pride
to
his
once
mortified
friends
with
his
whole
heart
therefore
he
threw
himself
into
the
work
before
him
staying
sometimes
well
into
the
afternoon
on
the
days
miss
winthrop
could
find
time
between
her
social
engagements
to
give
him
a
sitting
it
was
on
such
a
day
toward
the
middle
of
the
month
that
billy
was
called
to
the
telephone
at
twelve
to
speak
to
her
husband
billy
dear
began
bertram
at
once
if
you
do
mind
i
staying
to
luncheon
at
miss
winthrop
kind
request
we
changed
the
pose
neither
of
us
was
satisfied
you
know
but
we
have
quite
settled
on
the
new
one
miss
winthrop
has
two
whole
hours
this
afternoon
that
she
can
give
me
if
i
stay
and
of
course
under
the
circumstances
i
want
to
do
of
course
echoed
billy
billy
voice
was
indomitably
cheerful
thank
you
dear
i
knew
you
understand
sighed
bertram
contentedly
you
see
really
two
whole
hours
so
it
a
chance
i
ca
afford
to
of
course
you
ca
echoed
billy
again
all
right
then
till
called
the
man
answered
billy
still
cheerfully
as
she
turned
away
however
she
tossed
her
head
a
new
pose
indeed
she
muttered
with
some
asperity
just
as
if
there
could
be
a
pose
after
all
those
she
tried
last
year
immediately
after
luncheon
pete
and
eliza
started
for
south
boston
to
pay
a
visit
to
eliza
mother
and
it
was
soon
after
they
left
the
house
that
bertram
called
his
wife
up
again
say
dearie
i
forgot
to
tell
you
he
began
but
i
met
an
old
friend
in
the
subway
this
morning
and
i
well
i
remembered
what
you
said
about
bringing
home
to
dinner
next
time
so
i
asked
him
for
do
you
mind
it
mind
of
course
not
i
glad
you
did
plunged
in
billy
with
feverish
eagerness
even
now
just
the
bare
mention
of
anything
connected
with
that
awful
test
night
was
enough
to
set
billy
nerves
to
tingling
i
want
you
to
always
bring
them
home
all
right
dear
we
be
there
at
six
then
it
calderwell
this
time
you
remember
calderwell
of
not
calderwell
billy
question
was
a
little
faint
sure
bertram
laughed
oddly
and
lowered
his
voice
i
suspect
i
would
have
brought
him
home
to
you
i
was
too
jealous
but
now
well
now
maybe
i
want
him
to
see
what
he
but
bertram
only
laughed
mischievously
and
called
a
gay
till
then
billy
at
her
end
of
the
wires
hung
up
the
receiver
and
backed
against
the
wall
a
little
palpitatingly
calderwell
to
dinner
calderwell
did
she
remember
calderwell
did
she
indeed
as
if
one
could
easily
forget
the
man
that
for
a
year
or
two
had
proposed
marriage
as
regularly
and
almost
as
lightly
as
he
had
torn
a
monthly
leaf
from
his
calendar
besides
was
it
not
he
too
who
had
said
that
bertram
would
never
love
any
girl
that
it
would
be
only
the
tilt
of
her
chin
or
the
turn
of
her
head
that
he
loved
to
paint
and
now
he
was
coming
to
dinner
and
with
bertram
very
well
he
should
see
he
should
see
that
bertram
love
her
not
the
tilt
of
her
chin
nor
the
turn
of
her
head
he
should
see
how
happy
they
were
what
a
good
wife
she
made
and
how
devoted
and
bertram
was
in
his
home
he
should
see
and
forthwith
billy
picked
up
her
skirts
and
tripped
to
select
her
very
prettiest
to
do
honor
to
the
occasion
however
one
thing
and
another
delayed
her
so
that
it
was
four
when
she
turned
her
attention
to
her
toilet
and
it
was
while
she
was
hesitating
whether
to
be
stately
and
impressive
in
royally
sumptuous
blue
velvet
and
ermine
or
cozy
and
tantalizingly
homy
sic
in
crêpe
de
chine
and
that
the
telephone
bell
rang
again
eliza
and
pete
had
not
yet
returned
so
as
before
billy
answered
it
this
time
eliza
shaking
voice
came
to
her
is
that

eliza

a
trembling
little
laugh

then

some
time
this

sighed
eliza
from
the
telephone
billy
turned
away
with
a
troubled
face
pete
ill
she
was
saying
to
herself
i
do
like
the
looks
of
it
and
he
so
faithful
he
come
if
with
a
little
cry
billy
stopped
short
then
tremblingly
she
sank
into
the
nearest
chair
calderwell
and
he
coming
to
she
moaned
for
two
benumbed
minutes
billy
sat
staring
at
nothing
then
she
ran
to
the
telephone
and
called
the
annex
aunt
hannah
answered
aunt
hannah
for
heaven
sake
if
you
love
me
pleaded
billy

rosa
down

and
bertram
is

if
it
was
for

as
if
i
let
you
there
is
anybody
here
only
tommy
even
alice
is
gone
oh
billy
billy
this
only
goes
to
prove
what
i
always
said
that
woman
to
be
a
wife
until
she
an
efficient
housekeeper
and
yes
yes
aunt
hannah
i
know
moaned
billy
frenziedly
but
i
am
a
wife
and
i
not
an
efficient
housekeeper
and
hugh
calderwell
wait
for
me
to
learn
he
coming
and
i
got
to
do
something
never
mind
i
fix
it
some
way
but
billy
billy
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
fluttered
aunt
hannah
voice
across
the
wires
as
billy
snapped
the
receiver
into
place
for
the
second
time
that
day
billy
backed
palpitatingly
against
the
wall
her
eyes
sought
the
clock
fearfully
fifteen
minutes
past
four
she
had
an
hour
and
three
quarters
she
could
of
course
telephone
bertram
to
dine
calderwell
at
a
club
or
some
hotel
but
to
do
this
now
the
very
first
time
when
it
had
been
her
own
suggestion
that
he
bring
them
home
no
no
she
could
not
do
that
anything
but
that
besides
very
likely
she
could
not
reach
bertram
anyway
doubtless
he
had
left
the
winthrops
by
this
time
there
was
marie
she
could
telephone
marie
but
marie
could
not
very
well
come
just
now
she
knew
and
then
too
there
was
cyril
to
be
taken
into
consideration
how
cyril
would
gibe
at
the
wife
who
had
to
call
in
all
the
neighbors
just
because
her
husband
was
bringing
home
a
friend
to
dinner
how
he
would
well
he
should
he
should
not
have
the
chance
so
there
with
a
jerk
bertram
henshaw
pulled
herself
away
from
the
wall
and
stood
erect
her
eyes
snapped
and
the
very
poise
of
her
chin
spelled
determination
very
well
she
would
show
them
was
not
bertram
bringing
this
man
home
because
he
was
proud
of
her
mighty
proud
he
would
be
if
she
had
to
call
in
half
of
boston
to
get
his
dinner
for
him
nonsense
she
would
get
it
herself
was
not
this
the
time
if
ever
to
be
an
oak
a
vine
doubtless
would
lean
and
cling
and
telephone
and
whine
i
ca
but
not
an
oak
an
oak
would
hold
up
its
head
and
say
i
can
an
oak
would
go
ahead
and
get
that
dinner
she
would
be
an
oak
she
would
get
that
dinner
what
if
she
did
know
how
to
cook
bread
and
cake
and
pies
and
things
one
did
not
have
to
cook
bread
and
cake
and
pies
just
to
get
a
dinner
meat
and
potatoes
and
vegetables
besides
she
make
peach
fritters
she
knew
she
could
she
would
show
them
and
with
actually
a
bit
of
song
on
her
lips
billy
skipped
for
her
ruffled
apron
and
two
necessary
accompaniments
to
this
in
her
opinion
billy
found
the
apron
and
with
no
difficulty
but
it
took
fully
ten
of
her
precious
minutes
to
unearth
from
its
obscure
the
bride
helper
cookbook
one
of
aunt
hannah
wedding
gifts
on
the
way
to
the
kitchen
billy
planned
her
dinner
as
was
natural
perhaps
she
chose
the
things
she
herself
would
like
to
eat
i
wo
attempt
anything
very
elaborate
she
said
to
herself
it
would
be
wiser
to
have
something
simple
like
chicken
pie
perhaps
i
love
chicken
pie
and
i
have
oyster
stew
first
that
is
after
the
grapefruit
just
oysters
boiled
in
milk
must
be
easier
than
soup
to
make
i
begin
with
grapefruit
with
a
cherry
in
it
like
pete
fixes
it
those
do
have
to
be
cooked
anyhow
i
have
fish
bertram
loves
the
fish
course
let
me
see
halibut
i
guess
with
egg
sauce
i
have
any
roast
nothing
but
the
chicken
pie
and
i
have
squash
and
onions
i
can
have
a
salad
easy
just
lettuce
and
stuff
that
have
to
be
cooked
oh
and
the
peach
fritters
if
i
get
time
to
make
them
for
dessert
well
maybe
i
can
find
a
new
pie
or
pudding
in
the
cookbook
i
want
to
use
that
cookbook
for
something
after
hunting
all
this
time
for
it
in
the
kitchen
billy
found
exquisite
neatness
and
silence
the
first
brought
an
approving
light
to
her
eyes
but
the
second
for
some
unapparent
reason
filled
her
heart
with
vague
misgiving
this
feeling
however
billy
resolutely
cast
from
her
as
she
crossed
the
room
dropped
her
book
on
to
the
table
and
turned
toward
the
shining
black
stove
there
was
an
excellent
fire
glowing
points
of
light
showed
that
only
a
good
draft
was
needed
to
make
the
whole
mass
of
coal
billy
however
did
not
know
this
her
experience
of
fires
was
confined
to
burning
wood
in
open
grates
and
wood
in
open
grates
had
to
be
poked
to
make
it
red
and
glowing
with
confident
alacrity
now
therefore
billy
caught
up
the
poker
thrust
it
into
the
mass
of
coals
and
gave
them
a
fine
stirring
up
then
she
set
back
the
lid
of
the
stove
and
went
to
hunt
up
the
ingredients
for
her
dinner
by
the
time
billy
had
searched
five
minutes
and
found
no
chicken
no
oysters
and
no
halibut
it
occurred
to
her
that
her
larder
was
not
after
all
an
open
market
and
that
one
provisions
must
be
especially
ordered
to
fit
one
needs
as
to
ordering
them
now
billy
glanced
at
the
clock
and
shook
her
head
it
almost
five
already
and
they
never
get
here
in
time
she
sighed
regretfully
i
have
to
have
something
billy
looked
now
not
for
what
she
wanted
but
for
what
she
could
find
and
she
found
some
cold
roast
lamb
at
which
she
turned
up
her
nose
an
uncooked
beefsteak
which
she
appropriated
doubtfully
a
raw
turnip
and
a
head
of
lettuce
which
she
hailed
with
glee
and
some
beets
potatoes
onions
and
grapefruit
from
all
of
which
she
took
a
generous
supply
thus
laden
she
went
back
to
the
kitchen
spread
upon
the
table
they
made
a
brave
show
oh
well
i
have
quite
a
dinner
after
all
she
triumphed
cocking
her
head
happily
and
now
for
the
dessert
she
finished
pouncing
on
the
cookbook
it
was
while
she
was
turning
the
leaves
to
find
the
pies
and
puddings
that
she
ran
across
the
vegetables
and
found
the
word
beets
staring
her
in
the
face
mechanically
she
read
the
line
below
winter
beets
will
require
three
hours
to
cook
use
hot
billy
startled
eyes
sought
the
clock
three
hours
and
it
was
five
now
frenziedly
then
she
ran
her
finger
down
the
page
onions
one
and
hours
use
hot
water
turnips
require
a
long
time
but
if
cut
thin
they
will
cook
in
an
hour
and
a
an
hour
and
a
quarter
indeed
she
moaned
is
there
anything
anywhere
that
does
take
forever
to
cook
early
peas
green
corn
summer
squash
mumbled
billy
dry
lips
but
what
do
folks
eat
in
january
it
was
the
apparently
inoffensive
sentence
new
potatoes
will
boil
in
thirty
minutes
that
brought
fresh
terror
to
billy
soul
and
set
her
to
fluttering
the
cookbook
leaves
with
renewed
haste
if
it
took
potatoes
thirty
minutes
to
cook
how
long
did
it
take
old
ones
in
vain
she
searched
for
the
answer
there
were
plenty
of
potatoes
they
were
mashed
whipped
scalloped
creamed
fried
and
broiled
they
were
made
into
puffs
croquettes
potato
border
and
potato
snow
for
many
of
these
they
were
boiled
first
until
tender
one
rule
said
but
that
does
tell
me
how
long
it
takes
to
get
tender
fumed
billy
despairingly
i
suppose
they
think
anybody
ought
to
know
that
but
i
do
suddenly
her
eyes
fell
once
more
on
the
instructions
for
boiling
turnips
and
her
face
cleared
if
it
helps
to
cut
turnips
thin
why
not
potatoes
she
cried
i
do
that
anyhow
and
i
will
she
finished
with
a
sigh
of
relief
as
she
caught
up
half
a
dozen
potatoes
and
hurried
into
the
pantry
for
a
knife
a
few
minutes
later
the
potatoes
peeled
and
cut
almost
to
wafer
thinness
were
dumped
into
a
basin
of
cold
water
there
now
i
guess
you
cook
nodded
billy
to
the
dish
in
her
hand
as
she
hurried
to
the
stove
chilled
by
an
ominous
unresponsiveness
billy
lifted
the
stove
lid
and
peered
inside
only
a
mass
of
black
and
graying
coals
greeted
her
the
fire
was
out
to
think
that
even
you
had
to
go
back
on
me
like
this
upbraided
billy
eyeing
the
dismal
mass
with
reproachful
gaze
this
disaster
however
as
billy
knew
was
not
so
great
as
it
seemed
for
there
was
still
the
gas
stove
in
the
old
days
under
dong
rule
there
had
been
no
gas
stove
dong
ling
disapproved
of
devil
stoves
that
had
no
coalee
no
woodee
but
burned
like
eliza
however
did
approve
of
them
and
not
long
after
her
arrival
a
fine
one
had
been
put
in
for
her
use
so
now
billy
soon
had
her
potatoes
with
a
brisk
blaze
under
them
in
frantic
earnest
then
billy
went
to
work
brushing
the
discarded
onions
turnip
and
beets
into
a
pail
under
the
table
she
was
still
confronted
with
the
beefsteak
lettuce
and
grapefruit
all
but
the
beefsteak
she
pushed
to
one
side
with
gentle
pats
you
all
right
she
nodded
to
them
i
can
use
you
you
do
have
to
be
cooked
bless
your
hearts
but
billy
scowled
at
the
beefsteak
and
ran
her
finger
down
the
index
of
the
helper
billy
knew
how
to
handle
that
book
now
no
you
do
not
for
me
she
muttered
after
a
minute
shaking
her
finger
at
the
tenderloin
on
the
table
i
have
got
any
coals
and
i
thought
a
was
where
they
played
football
though
it
seems
it
some
sort
of
a
dish
to
cook
you
in
here
but
i
know
it
from
a
teaspoon
probably
if
i
should
see
it
no
sir
back
to
the
refrigerator
for
you
and
a
nice
cold
sensible
roast
leg
of
lamb
for
me
that
does
have
to
be
cooked
understand
she
finished
as
she
carried
the
beefsteak
away
and
took
possession
of
the
hitherto
despised
cold
lamb
once
more
billy
made
a
mad
search
through
cupboards
and
shelves
this
time
she
bore
back
in
triumph
a
can
of
corn
another
of
tomatoes
and
a
glass
jar
of
preserved
peaches
in
the
kitchen
a
cheery
bubbling
from
the
potatoes
on
the
stove
greeted
her
billy
spirits
rose
with
the
steam
there
spunkie
she
said
gayly
to
the
cat
who
had
just
uncurled
from
a
nap
behind
the
stove
tell
me
i
ca
get
up
a
dinner
and
maybe
we
have
the
peach
fritters
too
she
chirped
i
got
the
but
billy
did
not
have
the
peach
fritters
after
all
she
got
out
the
sugar
and
the
flour
to
be
sure
and
she
made
a
great
ado
looking
up
the
rule
but
a
hurried
glance
at
the
clock
sent
her
into
the
to
set
the
table
and
all
thought
of
the
peach
fritters
was
given
up
chapter
x
the
dinner
billy
got
at
five
minutes
of
six
bertram
and
calderwell
came
bertram
gave
his
peculiar
ring
and
let
himself
in
with
his
latchkey
but
billy
did
not
meet
him
in
the
hall
nor
in
the
excusing
himself
bertram
hurried
billy
was
not
in
her
room
nor
anywhere
on
that
floor
she
was
not
in
william
room
coming
to
the
hall
again
bertram
confronted
william
who
had
just
come
in
where
billy
demanded
the
young
husband
with
just
a
touch
of
irritation
as
if
he
suspected
william
of
having
billy
in
his
pocket
william
stared
slightly
why
i
do
know
is
she
here
i
ask
pete
frowned
bertram
in
the
bertram
found
no
one
though
the
table
was
prettily
set
and
showed
half
a
grapefruit
at
each
place
in
the
kitchen
in
the
kitchen
bertram
found
a
din
of
rattling
tin
an
odor
of
burned
food
a
confusion
of
scattered
pots
and
pans
a
frightened
cat
who
peered
at
him
from
under
a
littered
stove
and
a
flushed
disheveled
young
woman
in
a
blue
and
ruffled
apron
whom
he
finally
recognized
as
his
wife
why
billy
he
gasped
billy
who
was
struggling
with
something
at
the
sink
turned
sharply
bertram
henshaw
she
panted
i
used
to
think
you
were
wonderful
because
you
could
paint
a
picture
i
even
used
to
think
i
was
a
little
wonderful
because
i
could
write
a
song
well
i
do
any
more
but
tell
you
who
wonderful
it
eliza
and
rosa
and
all
the
rest
of
those
women
who
can
get
a
meal
on
to
the
table
all
at
once
so
it
fit
to
eat
why
billy
gasped
bertram
again
falling
back
to
the
door
he
had
closed
behind
him
what
in
the
world
does
this
mean
mean
it
means
i
getting
dinner
choked
billy
ca
you
see
but
pete
eliza
they
sick
i
mean
he
sick
and
i
said
i
do
it
i
be
an
oak
but
how
did
i
know
there
was
anything
in
the
house
except
stuff
that
took
hours
to
cook
only
potatoes
and
how
did
i
know
that
cooked
in
no
time
and
then
got
all
smushy
and
wet
staying
in
the
water
and
how
did
i
know
that
everything
else
would
stick
on
and
burn
on
till
you
used
every
dish
there
was
in
the
house
to
cook
in
why
billy
gasped
bertram
for
the
third
time
and
then
because
he
had
been
married
only
six
months
instead
of
six
years
he
made
the
mistake
of
trying
to
argue
with
a
woman
whose
nerves
were
already
at
the
snapping
point
but
dear
it
was
so
foolish
of
you
to
do
all
this
why
did
you
telephone
why
did
you
get
somebody
like
an
irate
little
tigress
billy
turned
at
bay
bertram
henshaw
she
flamed
angrily
if
you
do
go
and
tend
to
that
man
up
there
i
shall
now
go
i
be
up
when
i
and
bertram
went
it
was
not
so
very
long
after
all
before
billy
came
in
to
greet
her
guest
she
was
not
stately
and
imposing
in
royally
sumptuous
blue
velvet
and
ermine
nor
yet
was
she
cozy
and
homy
in
crêpe
de
chine
and
she
was
just
herself
in
a
pretty
little
morning
house
gown
of
blue
gingham
she
was
minus
the
and
the
ruffled
apron
but
she
had
a
dab
of
flour
on
the
left
cheek
and
a
smutch
of
crock
on
her
forehead
she
had
too
a
cut
finger
on
her
right
hand
and
a
burned
thumb
on
her
left
but
she
was
billy
and
being
billy
she
advanced
with
a
bright
smile
and
held
out
a
cordial
hand
not
even
wincing
when
the
cut
finger
came
under
calderwell
hearty
clasp
i
glad
to
see
you
she
welcomed
him
you
excuse
my
not
appearing
sooner
i
sure
for
did
bertram
tell
you
i
playing
bridget
but
dinner
is
ready
now
and
we
go
down
please
she
smiled
as
she
laid
a
light
hand
on
her
guest
arm
behind
her
bertram
remembering
the
scene
in
the
kitchen
stared
in
sheer
amazement
bertram
it
might
be
mentioned
again
had
been
married
six
months
not
six
years
what
billy
had
intended
to
serve
for
a
simple
dinner
that
night
was
grapefruit
with
cherries
oyster
stew
boiled
halibut
with
egg
sauce
chicken
pie
squash
onions
and
potatoes
peach
fritters
a
lettuce
and
stuff
salad
and
some
new
pie
or
pudding
what
she
did
serve
was
grapefruit
without
the
cherries
cold
roast
lamb
potatoes
a
mush
of
sogginess
tomatoes
canned
and
slightly
burned
corn
canned
and
very
much
burned
lettuce
plain
and
for
dessert
preserved
peaches
and
cake
the
latter
rather
dry
and
stale
such
was
billy
dinner
the
grapefruit
everybody
ate
the
cold
lamb
too
met
with
a
hearty
reception
especially
after
the
potatoes
corn
and
tomatoes
were
served
and
tasted
outwardly
through
it
all
billy
was
gayety
itself
inwardly
she
was
burning
up
with
anger
and
mortification
and
because
she
was
all
this
there
was
apparently
no
limit
to
her
laughter
and
sparkling
repartee
as
she
talked
with
calderwell
her
guest
the
guest
who
according
to
her
original
plans
was
to
be
shown
how
happy
she
and
bertram
were
what
a
good
wife
she
made
and
how
devoted
and
bertram
was
in
his
home
william
picking
at
his
dinner
as
only
a
hungry
man
can
pick
at
a
dinner
that
is
uneatable
watched
billy
with
a
puzzled
uneasy
frown
bertram
choking
over
the
few
mouthfuls
he
ate
marked
his
animated
face
and
calderwell
absorbed
attention
and
settled
into
gloomy
silence
but
it
could
not
continue
forever
the
preserved
peaches
were
eaten
at
last
and
the
stale
cake
left
billy
had
forgotten
the
coffee
which
was
just
as
well
perhaps
then
the
four
trailed
to
the
at
nine
an
anxious
eliza
and
a
remorseful
apologetic
pete
came
home
and
descended
to
the
horror
the
once
orderly
kitchen
and
had
become
at
ten
calderwell
with
very
evident
reluctance
tore
himself
away
from
billy
gay
badinage
and
said
good
night
at
two
minutes
past
ten
an
exhausted
billy
was
trying
to
cry
on
the
shoulders
of
both
uncle
william
and
bertram
at
once
there
there
child
do
it
went
off
all
right
patted
uncle
william
billy
darling
pleaded
bertram
please
do
cry
so
as
if
i
ever
let
you
step
foot
in
that
kitchen
again
at
this
billy
raised
a
face
aflame
with
indignant
determination
as
if
i
ever
let
you
keep
me
it
bertram
henshaw
after
this
she
contested
i
not
going
to
do
another
thing
in
all
my
life
but
when
i
think
of
the
stuff
we
had
to
eat
after
all
the
time
i
took
to
get
it
i
simply
crazy
do
you
think
i
run
the
risk
of
such
a
thing
as
this
ever
happening
again
chapter
xi
calderwell
does
some
questioning
on
the
day
after
his
dinner
with
and
bertram
henshaw
hugh
calderwell
left
boston
and
did
not
return
until
more
than
a
month
had
passed
one
of
his
first
acts
when
he
did
come
was
to
look
up
arkwright
at
the
address
which
billy
had
given
him
calderwell
had
not
seen
arkwright
since
they
parted
in
paris
some
two
years
before
after
a
tramp
through
europe
together
calderwell
liked
arkwright
then
greatly
and
he
lost
no
time
now
in
renewing
the
acquaintance
the
address
as
given
by
billy
proved
to
be
an
attractive
but
modest
apartment
hotel
near
the
conservatory
of
music
and
calderwell
was
delighted
to
find
arkwright
at
home
in
his
comfortable
little
bachelor
suite
arkwright
greeted
him
most
cordially
well
well
he
cried
if
it
is
calderwell
and
how
mont
blanc
or
is
it
the
killarney
lakes
this
time
or
maybe
the
sphinx
that
i
should
inquire
for
eh
guess
again
laughed
calderwell
throwing
off
his
heavy
coat
and
settling
himself
comfortably
in
the
morris
chair
his
friend
pulled
forward
do
it
retorted
arkwright
with
a
smile
i
never
gamble
on
palpable
uncertainties
except
for
a
chance
throw
or
two
as
i
gave
a
minute
ago
your
movements
are
altogether
too
erratic
and
too
for
ordinary
mortals
to
keep
track
well
maybe
you
right
grinned
calderwell
appreciatively
anyhow
you
would
have
lost
this
time
sure
thing
for
i
been
seen
the
doctor
yet
queried
arkwright
coolly
pushing
the
cigars
across
the
table
thanks
for
both
sniffed
calderwell
with
a
reproachful
glance
helping
himself
your
good
judgment
in
some
matters
is
still
unimpaired
i
see
he
observed
tapping
the
little
gilded
band
which
had
told
him
the
cigar
was
an
old
favorite
as
to
other
matters
however
you
wrong
again
my
friend
in
your
surmise
i
am
not
sick
and
i
have
been
so
well
i
told
they
have
very
good
specialists
here
some
one
of
them
ought
to
hit
your
case
still
how
long
has
it
been
running
arkwright
face
showed
only
grave
concern
oh
come
let
up
arkwright
snapped
calderwell
striking
his
match
alight
with
a
vigorous
jerk
i
admit
i
have
ever
given
any
indication
of
an
absorbing
passion
for
work
but
what
can
you
expect
of
a
fellow
born
with
a
whole
dozen
silver
spoons
in
his
mouth
and
that
what
i
was
according
to
bertram
henshaw
according
to
him
again
it
a
wonder
i
ever
tried
to
feed
myself
and
perhaps
right
with
my
mouth
already
so
i
should
say
so
laughed
arkwright
well
be
that
as
it
may
i
going
to
feed
myself
and
i
going
to
earn
my
feed
too
i
have
climbed
a
mountain
or
paddled
a
canoe
for
a
year
i
been
in
chicago
cultivating
the
acquaintance
of
john
doe
and
richard
you
mean
law
sure
i
studied
it
here
for
a
while
before
that
bout
of
ours
a
couple
of
years
ago
billy
drove
me
away
billy
er
mrs
henshaw
yes
i
thought
i
told
you
she
turned
down
my
proposal
so
emphatically
that
i
lost
all
interest
in
boston
and
took
to
the
tall
timber
again
but
i
come
back
a
friend
of
my
father
wrote
me
to
come
on
and
consider
a
good
opening
there
was
in
his
law
office
i
came
on
a
month
ago
and
considered
then
i
went
back
to
pack
up
now
come
for
good
and
here
i
am
you
have
my
history
to
date
now
tell
me
of
yourself
you
looking
as
fit
as
a
penny
from
the
mint
even
though
you
have
discarded
that
brown
beard
was
that
a
concession
to
er
arkwright
lifted
a
quick
hand
of
protest
jeremiah
please
there
is
no
jane
now
he
said
a
bit
stiffly
the
other
stared
a
little
then
he
gave
a
low
chuckle
jeremiah
he
repeated
musingly
eyeing
the
glowing
tip
of
his
cigar
and
to
think
how
that
mysterious
j
used
to
tantalize
me
do
you
mean
he
added
turning
slowly
that
no
one
calls
you
jane
now
not
if
they
know
what
is
best
for
oh
calderwell
noted
the
smouldering
fire
in
the
other
eyes
a
little
curiously
very
well
i
take
the
hint
michael
arkwright
relaxed
a
little
to
tell
the
truth
i
had
quite
enough
now
of
mary
very
good
so
be
it
nodded
the
other
still
regarding
his
friend
thoughtfully
but
tell
me
what
of
yourself
arkwright
shrugged
his
shoulders
there
nothing
to
tell
you
seen
i
humph
very
pretty
scoffed
calderwell
then
if
wo
tell
i
i
saw
billy
a
month
ago
you
see
it
seems
you
hit
the
trail
for
grand
opera
as
you
threatened
to
that
night
in
paris
but
you
brought
up
in
vaudeville
as
you
prophesied
you
would
do
though
for
that
matter
judging
from
the
plums
some
of
the
stars
are
picking
on
the
vaudeville
stage
nowadays
that
is
to
be
sneezed
at
but
billy
says
you
made
two
or
three
appearances
already
on
the
sacred
boards
themselves
one
of
them
a
subscription
performance
and
that
you
created
no
end
of
a
nonsense
i
merely
a
student
at
the
opera
school
here
scowled
arkwright
oh
yes
billy
said
you
were
that
but
she
also
said
you
be
long
that
you
already
had
one
good
offer
i
not
speaking
of
marriage
and
that
you
were
going
abroad
next
summer
and
that
they
were
all
insufferably
proud
of
nonsense
scowled
arkwright
again
coloring
like
a
girl
that
is
only
some
of
of
henshaw
kind
calderwell
jerked
the
cigar
from
between
his
lips
and
sat
suddenly
forward
in
his
chair
arkwright
tell
me
about
them
how
are
they
making
it
go
arkwright
frowned
who
make
what
go
he
asked
the
henshaws
is
she
happy
is
he
on
the
square
arkwright
face
darkened
well
really
he
began
but
calderwell
interrupted
oh
come
do
be
squeamish
you
think
i
butting
into
what
concern
me
but
i
not
what
concerns
billy
does
concern
me
and
if
he
does
make
her
happy
i
i
kill
in
spite
of
himself
arkwright
laughed
the
vehemence
of
the
words
and
the
fierceness
with
which
he
puffed
at
his
cigar
as
he
fell
back
in
his
chair
were
most
expressive
well
i
do
think
you
need
to
load
revolvers
nor
sharpen
daggers
just
yet
he
observed
grimly
calderwell
laughed
this
time
though
without
much
mirth
oh
i
not
in
love
with
billy
now
he
explained
please
do
think
i
am
i
should
see
her
if
i
was
of
arkwright
changed
his
position
suddenly
bringing
his
face
into
the
shadow
calderwell
talked
on
without
pausing
no
i
not
in
love
with
billy
but
billy
a
trump
you
know
i
the
words
were
low
but
steadily
spoken
of
course
you
do
we
all
do
and
we
want
her
happy
but
as
for
her
marrying
bertram
you
could
have
bowled
me
over
with
a
soap
bubble
when
i
heard
she
done
it
now
understand
bertram
is
a
good
fellow
and
i
like
him
i
known
him
all
his
life
and
he
all
right
oh
six
or
eight
years
ago
to
be
sure
he
got
in
with
a
set
of
fellows
bob
seaver
and
his
clique
that
were
no
good
went
in
for
bohemianism
and
all
that
rot
it
was
good
for
bertram
he
got
the
confounded
temperament
that
goes
with
his
talent
i
suppose
though
why
a
man
ca
paint
a
picture
or
sing
a
song
and
keep
his
temper
and
a
level
head
i
see
he
can
cut
in
arkwright
with
curt
emphasis
humph
well
that
what
i
think
but
about
this
marriage
business
bertram
admires
a
pretty
face
wherever
he
sees
it
and
always
has
not
but
that
he
straight
as
a
string
with
women
i
mean
that
but
girls
are
always
just
so
many
pictures
to
be
picked
up
on
his
brushes
and
transferred
to
his
canvases
and
as
for
his
settling
down
and
marrying
anybody
for
keeps
right
along
great
scott
imagine
bertram
henshaw
as
a
man
arkwright
stirred
restlessly
as
he
spoke
up
in
quick
defense
oh
but
he
is
i
assure
you
i
i
seen
them
in
their
home
together
many
times
i
think
they
are
very
arkwright
spoke
with
decision
though
still
a
little
diffidently
calderwell
was
silent
he
had
picked
up
the
little
gilt
band
he
had
torn
from
his
cigar
and
was
fingering
it
musingly
yes
i
seen
them
once
he
said
after
a
minute
i
took
dinner
with
them
when
i
was
on
a
month
i
heard
you
at
something
in
arkwright
voice
calderwell
turned
quickly
what
do
you
mean
why
do
you
say
it
like
that
arkwright
laughed
the
constraint
fled
from
his
manner
well
i
may
as
well
tell
you
you
hear
of
it
it
no
secret
henshaw
herself
tells
of
it
everywhere
it
was
her
friend
alice
greggory
who
told
me
of
it
first
however
it
seems
the
cook
was
gone
and
the
mistress
had
to
get
the
dinner
yes
i
know
but
you
should
hear
henshaw
tell
the
story
now
or
bertram
it
seems
she
knew
nothing
whatever
about
cooking
and
her
trials
and
tribulations
in
getting
that
dinner
on
to
the
table
were
only
one
degree
worse
than
the
dinner
itself
according
to
her
story
you
er
notice
anything
notice
anything
exploded
calderwell
i
noticed
that
billy
was
so
brilliant
she
fairly
radiated
sparks
and
i
noticed
that
bertram
was
so
glum
he
he
almost
radiated
thunderclaps
then
i
saw
that
billy
high
spirits
were
all
assumed
to
cover
a
threatened
burst
of
tears
and
i
laid
it
all
to
him
i
thought
he
said
something
to
hurt
her
and
i
could
have
punched
him
great
scott
was
what
ailed
them
i
reckon
it
was
alice
says
that
since
then
henshaw
has
fairly
haunted
the
kitchen
begging
eliza
to
teach
her
everything
single
she
knows
calderwell
chuckled
if
that
is
just
like
billy
she
never
does
anything
by
halves
by
george
but
she
was
game
over
that
dinner
i
can
see
it
all
alice
says
she
really
learning
to
cook
in
spite
of
old
horror
and
eliza
pleadings
not
to
spoil
her
pretty
then
pete
is
back
all
right
what
a
faithful
old
soul
he
is
arkwright
frowned
slightly
yes
he
faithful
but
he
is
all
right
by
any
means
i
think
a
sick
man
what
makes
billy
let
him
work
then
let
him
sniffed
arkwright
i
like
to
see
you
try
to
stop
him
henshaw
begs
and
pleads
with
him
to
stop
but
he
scouts
the
idea
pete
is
thoroughly
and
unalterably
convinced
that
the
family
would
starve
to
death
if
it
were
for
him
and
henshaw
says
that
she
admit
he
has
some
grounds
for
his
opinion
when
one
remembers
the
condition
of
the
kitchen
and
the
night
she
presided
over
poor
billy
chuckled
calderwell
i
have
gone
down
into
the
kitchen
myself
if
i
suspected
what
was
going
arkwright
raised
his
eyebrows
perhaps
it
well
you
did
if
bertram
picture
of
what
he
found
there
when
he
went
down
is
a
true
one
henshaw
acknowledges
that
even
the
cat
sought
refuge
under
the
as
if
the
veriest
worm
that
crawls
ever
needed
to
seek
refuge
from
billy
scoffed
calderwell
by
the
way
what
this
annex
i
hear
of
bertram
mentioned
it
but
i
could
get
either
of
them
to
tell
what
it
was
billy
would
and
bertram
said
he
could
not
with
billy
shaking
her
head
at
him
like
that
so
i
had
my
suspicions
one
of
billy
pet
charities
she
does
call
it
arkwright
face
and
voice
softened
it
is
hillside
she
still
keeps
it
open
she
calls
it
the
annex
to
her
home
she
filled
it
with
a
crippled
woman
a
poor
little
music
teacher
a
lame
boy
and
aunt
but
how
extraordinary
she
does
think
so
she
says
it
just
an
overflow
house
for
the
extra
happiness
she
ca
there
was
a
moment
silence
calderwell
laid
down
his
cigar
pulled
out
his
handkerchief
and
blew
his
nose
furiously
then
he
got
to
his
feet
and
walked
to
the
fireplace
after
a
minute
he
turned
well
if
she
is
the
beat
he
spluttered
and
i
had
the
gall
to
ask
you
if
henshaw
made
her
happy
overflow
house
indeed
the
best
of
it
is
the
way
she
does
it
smiled
arkwright
they
all
the
sort
of
people
ordinary
charity
could
never
reach
and
the
only
way
she
got
them
there
at
all
was
to
make
each
one
think
that
he
or
she
was
absolutely
necessary
to
the
rest
of
them
even
as
it
is
they
all
pay
a
little
something
toward
the
running
expenses
of
the
house
they
insisted
on
that
and
henshaw
had
to
let
them
i
believe
her
chief
difficulty
now
is
that
she
has
not
less
than
six
people
whom
she
wishes
to
put
into
the
two
extra
rooms
still
unoccupied
and
she
ca
make
up
her
mind
which
to
take
her
husband
says
he
expects
to
hear
any
day
of
an
annexette
to
the
humph
grunted
calderwell
as
he
turned
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
bertram
is
still
painting
i
oh
what
he
doing
now
several
things
he
up
to
his
eyes
in
work
as
you
probably
have
heard
he
met
with
a
severe
accident
last
summer
and
lost
the
use
of
his
right
arm
for
many
months
i
believe
they
thought
at
one
time
he
had
lost
it
forever
but
it
all
right
now
and
he
has
several
commissions
for
portraits
alice
says
he
doing
ideal
heads
again
same
old
of
a
girl
i
suppose
so
though
alice
did
say
of
course
his
special
work
just
now
is
painting
the
portrait
of
miss
marguerite
winthrop
you
may
have
heard
that
he
tried
it
last
year
and
and
did
make
quite
a
success
of
yes
my
sister
belle
told
me
she
hears
from
billy
once
in
a
while
will
it
be
a
go
this
time
we
hope
so
for
everybody
sake
i
imagine
no
one
has
seen
it
yet
it
not
finished
but
alice
says
calderwell
turned
abruptly
a
quizzical
smile
on
his
face
see
here
my
son
he
interposed
it
strikes
me
that
this
alice
is
saying
a
good
deal
to
you
who
is
she
arkwright
gave
a
light
laugh
why
i
told
you
she
is
miss
alice
greggory
henshaw
friend
and
mine
i
have
known
her
for
what
is
she
like
like
why
she
like
like
herself
of
course
you
have
to
know
alice
she
the
salt
of
the
earth
alice
is
smiled
arkwright
rising
to
his
feet
with
a
remonstrative
gesture
as
he
saw
calderwell
pick
up
his
coat
what
your
hurry
commented
calderwell
again
ignoring
the
question
and
when
may
i
ask
do
you
intend
to
appropriate
this
er
salt
to
er
ah
season
your
own
life
with
as
i
might
say
eh
arkwright
laughed
there
was
not
the
slightest
trace
of
embarrassment
in
his
face
never
on
the
wrong
track
this
time
alice
and
i
are
good
friends
always
have
been
and
always
will
be
i
nothing
more
nothing
more
i
see
her
frequently
she
is
musical
and
the
henshaws
are
good
enough
to
ask
us
there
often
together
you
will
meet
her
doubtless
now
yourself
she
is
frequently
at
the
henshaw
calderwell
still
eyed
his
host
shrewdly
then
you
give
me
a
clear
field
eh
arkwright
eyes
met
his
friend
gaze
without
swerving
all
right
however
i
suppose
you
tell
me
as
i
did
you
once
that
a
right
of
way
in
such
a
case
does
mean
a
thoroughfare
for
the
party
interested
if
my
memory
serves
me
i
gave
you
right
of
way
in
paris
to
win
the
affections
of
a
certain
elusive
miss
billy
here
in
boston
if
you
could
but
i
see
you
did
seem
to
improve
your
opportunities
he
finished
teasingly
arkwright
stooped
of
a
sudden
to
pick
up
a
bit
of
paper
from
the
floor
no
he
said
quietly
i
did
seem
to
improve
my
this
time
he
did
not
meet
calderwell
eyes
the
had
been
said
when
calderwell
turned
abruptly
at
the
door
oh
i
say
i
suppose
you
going
to
that
devil
carnival
at
jordan
hall
devil
carnival
you
do
mean
cyril
henshaw
piano
recital
sure
i
do
grinned
calderwell
unabashed
and
i
warrant
it
be
a
devil
carnival
too
is
cyril
henshaw
going
to
play
his
own
music
oh
i
know
i
hopeless
from
your
standpoint
but
i
ca
help
it
i
like
mine
with
some
go
in
it
and
a
tune
that
you
can
find
without
hunting
for
it
and
i
do
like
lost
spirits
gone
mad
that
wail
and
shriek
through
ten
perfectly
good
minutes
and
then
die
with
a
gasping
moan
whose
home
is
the
tombs
however
you
going
i
take
of
course
i
am
laughed
the
other
you
could
hire
alice
to
miss
one
shriek
of
those
spirits
besides
i
rather
like
them
myself
you
yes
i
suppose
you
do
you
brought
up
on
it
in
your
business
but
me
for
the
widow
and
even
the
hoary
bells
every
time
however
i
going
to
be
there
out
of
respect
to
the
poor
family
and
by
the
way
that
another
thing
that
bowled
me
over
cyril
marriage
why
cyril
hates
women
not
all
women
we
hope
smiled
arkwright
do
you
know
his
wife
not
much
i
used
to
see
her
a
little
at
billy
music
teacher
she
then
she
the
same
sort
i
but
she
is
laughed
arkwright
oh
she
taught
music
but
that
was
only
because
of
necessity
i
take
it
she
domestic
through
and
through
with
an
overwhelming
passion
for
making
puddings
and
darning
socks
i
hear
alice
says
she
believes
cyril
knows
every
dish
and
spoon
by
its
christian
name
and
that
there
never
so
much
as
a
spool
of
thread
out
of
order
in
the
but
how
does
cyril
stand
it
the
trials
and
tribulations
of
domestic
life
bertram
used
to
declare
that
the
whole
strata
was
aquiver
with
fear
when
cyril
was
composing
and
i
remember
him
as
a
perfect
bear
if
anybody
so
much
as
whispered
when
he
was
in
one
of
his
moods
i
never
forgot
the
night
bertram
and
i
were
up
in
william
room
trying
to
sing
johnnie
comes
marching
home
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
banjo
in
bertram
hands
and
a
guitar
in
mine
gorry
it
was
hugh
that
went
marching
home
that
oh
well
from
reports
i
reckon
cyril
does
play
either
a
banjo
or
a
guitar
smiled
arkwright
alice
says
she
wears
rubber
heels
on
her
shoes
and
has
put
hushers
on
all
the
and
between
all
the
plates
and
saucers
anyhow
cyril
is
building
a
new
house
and
he
looks
as
if
he
were
in
a
pretty
healthy
condition
as
you
see
humph
i
wish
he
make
his
music
healthy
then
grumbled
calderwell
as
he
opened
the
door
chapter
xii
for
billy
some
advice
february
brought
busy
days
the
public
opening
of
the
bohemian
ten
club
exhibition
was
to
take
place
the
sixth
of
march
with
a
private
view
for
invited
guests
the
night
before
and
it
was
at
this
exhibition
that
bertram
planned
to
show
his
portrait
of
marguerite
winthrop
he
also
if
possible
wished
to
enter
two
or
three
other
canvases
upon
which
he
was
spending
all
the
time
he
could
get
bertram
felt
that
he
was
doing
very
good
work
now
the
portrait
of
marguerite
winthrop
was
coming
on
finely
the
spoiled
idol
of
society
had
at
last
found
a
pose
and
a
costume
that
suited
her
and
she
was
graciously
pleased
to
give
the
artist
almost
as
many
sittings
as
he
wanted
the
elusive
something
in
her
face
which
had
previously
been
so
baffling
was
now
already
caught
and
held
bewitchingly
on
his
canvas
he
was
confident
that
the
portrait
would
be
a
success
he
was
also
much
interested
in
another
piece
of
work
which
he
intended
to
show
called
the
the
model
for
this
was
a
beautiful
young
girl
he
had
found
selling
flowers
with
her
father
in
a
street
booth
at
the
north
end
on
the
whole
bertram
was
very
happy
these
days
he
could
not
to
be
sure
spend
quite
so
much
time
with
billy
as
he
wished
but
she
understood
of
course
as
did
he
that
his
work
must
come
first
he
knew
that
she
tried
to
show
him
that
she
understood
it
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
help
thinking
occasionally
that
billy
did
sometimes
mind
his
necessary
absorption
in
his
painting
to
himself
bertram
owned
that
billy
was
in
some
ways
a
puzzle
to
him
her
conduct
was
still
erratic
at
times
one
day
he
would
seem
to
be
everything
to
her
the
next
almost
nothing
judging
by
the
ease
with
which
she
relinquished
his
society
and
substituted
that
of
some
one
else
arkwright
or
calderwell
for
instance
and
that
was
another
thing
bertram
was
ashamed
to
hint
even
to
himself
that
he
was
jealous
of
either
of
those
men
surely
after
what
had
happened
after
billy
emphatic
assertion
that
she
had
never
loved
any
one
but
himself
it
would
seem
not
only
absurd
but
disloyal
that
he
should
doubt
for
an
instant
billy
entire
devotion
to
him
and
yet
there
were
times
when
he
wished
he
come
home
and
not
always
find
alice
greggory
calderwell
arkwright
or
all
three
of
them
strumming
the
piano
in
the
at
such
times
always
though
if
he
did
feel
impatient
he
immediately
demanded
of
himself
are
you
then
the
kind
of
husband
that
begrudges
your
wife
young
companions
of
her
own
age
and
tastes
to
help
her
while
away
the
hours
that
you
can
not
possibly
spend
with
her
yourself
this
question
and
the
answer
that
his
better
self
always
gave
to
it
were
usually
sufficient
to
send
him
into
some
florists
for
a
bunch
of
violets
for
billy
or
into
a
candy
shop
on
a
like
atoning
errand
as
to
billy
billy
too
was
busy
these
days
chief
of
her
concerns
being
perhaps
attention
to
that
honeymoon
of
hers
to
see
that
it
did
not
wane
at
least
the
most
of
her
thoughts
and
many
of
her
actions
centered
about
that
object
billy
had
the
book
now
the
talk
to
young
for
a
time
she
had
worked
with
only
the
newspaper
criticism
to
guide
her
but
coming
at
last
to
the
conclusion
that
if
a
little
was
good
more
must
be
better
she
had
shyly
gone
into
a
bookstore
one
day
and
with
a
pink
blush
had
asked
for
the
book
since
bringing
it
home
she
had
studied
assiduously
though
never
if
bertram
was
near
keeping
it
when
not
in
use
in
a
remote
corner
of
her
desk
there
was
a
good
deal
in
the
book
that
billy
did
not
like
and
there
were
some
statements
that
worried
her
but
yet
there
was
much
that
she
tried
earnestly
to
follow
she
was
still
striving
to
be
the
oak
and
she
was
still
eagerly
endeavoring
to
brush
up
against
those
necessary
outside
interests
she
was
so
thankful
in
this
connection
for
alice
greggory
and
for
arkwright
and
hugh
calderwell
it
was
such
a
help
that
she
had
them
they
were
not
only
very
pleasant
and
entertaining
outside
interests
but
one
or
another
of
them
was
almost
always
conveniently
within
reach
then
too
it
pleased
her
to
think
that
she
was
furthering
the
pretty
love
story
between
alice
and
arkwright
and
she
furthering
it
she
was
sure
of
that
already
she
could
see
how
dependent
the
man
was
on
alice
how
he
looked
to
her
for
approbation
and
appealed
to
her
on
all
occasions
exactly
as
if
there
was
not
a
move
that
he
wanted
to
make
without
her
presence
near
him
billy
was
very
sure
now
of
arkwright
she
only
wished
she
were
as
much
so
of
alice
but
alice
troubled
her
not
but
that
alice
was
kindness
itself
to
the
man
either
it
was
only
a
peculiar
something
almost
like
fear
or
constraint
that
billy
thought
she
saw
in
alice
eyes
sometimes
when
arkwright
made
a
particularly
intimate
appeal
there
was
calderwell
too
he
also
worried
billy
she
feared
he
was
going
to
complicate
matters
still
more
by
falling
in
love
with
alice
himself
and
this
certainly
billy
did
not
want
at
all
as
this
phase
of
the
matter
presented
itself
indeed
billy
determined
to
appropriate
calderwell
a
little
more
exclusively
to
herself
when
the
four
were
together
thus
leaving
alice
for
arkwright
after
all
it
was
rather
entertaining
this
playing
at
cupid
assistant
if
she
not
have
bertram
all
the
time
it
was
fortunate
that
these
outside
interests
were
so
pleasurable
most
of
the
mornings
billy
spent
in
the
kitchen
despite
the
remonstrances
of
both
pete
and
eliza
almost
every
meal
now
was
graced
with
a
palatable
cake
pudding
or
muffin
that
billy
would
proudly
claim
as
her
handiwork
pete
still
served
at
table
and
made
strenuous
efforts
to
keep
up
all
his
old
duties
but
he
was
obviously
growing
weaker
and
really
serious
blunders
were
beginning
to
be
noticeable
bertram
even
hinted
once
or
twice
that
perhaps
it
would
be
just
as
well
to
insist
on
his
going
but
to
this
billy
would
not
give
her
consent
even
when
one
night
his
poor
old
trembling
hands
spilled
half
the
contents
of
a
soup
plate
over
a
new
and
costly
evening
gown
of
billy
own
she
still
refused
to
have
him
dismissed
why
bertram
i
would
do
it
she
declared
hotly
and
you
would
either
he
been
here
more
than
fifty
years
it
would
break
his
heart
he
really
too
ill
to
work
and
i
wish
he
would
go
of
his
own
accord
of
course
but
i
ever
tell
him
to
go
not
if
he
spills
soup
on
every
dress
i
got
i
buy
more
and
more
if
it
necessary
bless
his
dear
old
heart
he
thinks
he
really
serving
us
and
he
is
oh
yes
you
right
he
sighed
bertram
with
meaning
emphasis
as
he
abandoned
the
argument
in
addition
to
her
talk
to
young
wives
billy
found
herself
encountering
advice
and
comment
on
the
marriage
question
from
still
other
quarters
from
her
acquaintances
mostly
the
feminine
ones
right
and
left
continually
she
was
hearing
such
words
as
these
oh
well
what
can
you
expect
billy
you
an
old
married
woman
never
mind
you
find
he
like
all
the
rest
of
the
husbands
you
just
wait
and
see
better
begin
with
a
high
hand
billy
do
let
him
fool
you
mercy
if
i
had
a
husband
whose
business
it
was
to
look
at
beautiful
eyes
peachy
cheeks
and
luxurious
tresses
i
should
go
crazy
it
hard
enough
to
keep
a
man
eyes
on
yourself
when
his
daily
interests
are
supposed
to
be
just
lumps
of
coal
and
chunks
of
ice
without
flinging
him
into
the
very
jaws
of
temptation
like
asking
him
to
paint
a
pretty
girl
picture
in
response
to
all
this
of
course
billy
could
but
laugh
and
blush
and
toss
back
some
gay
reply
with
a
careless
unconcern
but
in
her
heart
she
did
not
like
it
sometimes
she
told
herself
that
if
there
were
not
any
advice
or
comment
from
anybody
either
book
or
woman
if
there
were
not
anybody
but
just
bertram
and
herself
life
would
be
just
one
long
honeymoon
forever
and
forever
once
or
twice
billy
was
tempted
to
go
to
marie
with
this
honeymoon
question
but
marie
was
very
busy
these
days
and
very
preoccupied
the
new
house
that
cyril
was
building
on
corey
hill
not
far
from
the
annex
was
almost
finished
and
marie
was
immersed
in
the
subject
of
and
interior
decoration
she
was
too
still
more
deeply
engrossed
in
the
fashioning
of
tiny
garments
of
the
softest
linen
lace
and
woolen
and
there
was
on
her
face
such
a
look
of
beatific
wonder
and
joy
that
billy
did
not
like
to
so
much
as
hint
that
there
was
in
the
world
such
a
book
as
when
the
honeymoon
wanes
a
talk
to
young
billy
tried
valiantly
these
days
not
to
mind
that
bertram
work
was
so
absorbing
she
tried
not
to
mind
that
his
business
dealt
not
with
lumps
of
coal
and
chunks
of
ice
but
with
beautiful
women
like
marguerite
winthrop
who
asked
him
to
luncheon
and
lovely
girls
like
his
model
for
the
rose
who
came
freely
to
his
studio
and
spent
hours
in
the
beloved
presence
being
studied
for
what
bertram
declared
was
absolutely
the
most
wonderful
poise
of
head
and
shoulders
that
he
had
ever
seen
billy
tried
also
these
days
to
so
conduct
herself
that
not
by
any
chance
could
calderwell
suspect
that
sometimes
she
was
jealous
of
bertram
art
not
for
worlds
would
she
have
had
calderwell
begin
to
get
the
notion
into
his
head
that
his
prophecy
concerning
caring
only
for
the
turn
of
a
girl
head
or
the
tilt
of
her
chin
to
paint
was
being
fulfilled
hence
particularly
gay
and
cheerful
was
billy
when
calderwell
was
near
nor
could
it
be
said
that
billy
was
really
unhappy
at
any
time
it
was
only
that
on
occasion
the
very
depth
of
her
happiness
in
bertram
love
frightened
her
lest
it
bring
disaster
to
herself
or
bertram
billy
still
went
frequently
to
the
annex
there
were
yet
two
unfilled
rooms
in
the
house
billy
was
hesitating
which
two
of
six
new
friends
of
hers
to
choose
as
occupants
and
it
was
one
day
early
in
march
after
she
had
been
talking
the
matter
over
with
aunt
hannah
that
aunt
hannah
said
dear
me
billy
if
you
had
your
way
i
believe
you
open
another
whole
house
do
you
know
that
just
what
i
thinking
of
retorted
billy
gravely
then
she
laughed
at
aunt
hannah
shocked
gesture
of
protest
oh
well
i
do
expect
to
she
added
i
have
lived
very
long
but
i
lived
long
enough
to
know
that
you
ca
always
do
what
you
want
just
as
if
there
were
anything
wanted
to
do
that
you
do
do
my
dear
reproved
aunt
hannah
mildly
yes
i
billy
drew
in
her
breath
with
a
little
catch
i
have
so
much
that
is
lovely
and
that
why
i
need
this
house
you
know
for
the
overflow
she
nodded
brightly
then
with
a
characteristic
change
of
subject
she
added
my
but
you
should
have
tasted
of
the
popovers
i
made
for
breakfast
this
morning
i
should
like
to
smiled
aunt
hannah
william
says
you
getting
to
be
quite
a
well
maybe
conceded
billy
doubtfully
oh
i
can
do
some
things
all
right
but
just
wait
till
pete
and
eliza
go
away
again
and
bertram
brings
home
a
friend
to
dinner
that
tell
the
tale
i
think
now
i
could
have
something
besides
and
burned
corn
but
maybe
i
would
when
the
time
came
if
only
i
could
buy
everything
i
needed
to
cook
with
i
be
all
right
but
i
ca
i
ca
buy
what
you
need
what
do
you
mean
billy
laughed
ruefully
well
every
other
question
i
ask
eliza
she
says
i
do
know
you
have
to
use
your
judgment
just
as
if
i
had
any
judgment
about
how
much
salt
to
use
or
what
dish
to
take
dear
me
aunt
hannah
the
man
that
will
grow
judgment
and
can
it
as
you
would
a
mess
of
peas
has
got
his
fortune
made
what
an
absurd
child
you
are
billy
laughed
aunt
hannah
i
used
to
tell
marie
by
the
way
how
is
marie
have
you
seen
her
lately
oh
yes
i
saw
her
yesterday
twinkled
billy
she
had
a
book
of
samples
spread
over
the
back
of
a
chair
two
bunches
of
samples
of
different
colored
damasks
on
the
table
before
her
a
mother
guide
propped
open
in
another
chair
and
a
pair
of
socks
in
her
lap
with
a
roll
each
of
pink
and
white
and
blue
ribbon
she
spent
most
of
the
time
after
i
had
helped
her
choose
the
ribbon
in
asking
me
if
i
thought
she
ought
to
let
the
baby
cry
and
bother
cyril
or
stop
its
crying
and
hurt
the
baby
because
her
guide
says
a
certain
amount
of
crying
is
needed
to
develop
a
baby
aunt
hannah
laughed
but
she
frowned
too
the
idea
i
guess
cyril
can
stand
proper
crying
and
laughing
too
from
his
own
child
she
said
then
crisply
oh
but
marie
is
afraid
he
ca
smiled
billy
and
that
the
trouble
she
says
that
the
only
thing
that
worries
her
nonsense
ejaculated
aunt
hannah
oh
but
it
is
nonsense
to
marie
retorted
billy
you
should
see
the
preparations
she
made
and
the
precautions
she
taken
actually
when
i
saw
those
baby
socks
in
her
lap
i
did
know
but
she
was
going
to
put
rubber
heels
on
them
they
built
the
new
house
with
deadening
felt
in
all
the
walls
and
marie
planned
the
nursery
and
cyril
den
at
opposite
ends
of
the
house
and
she
says
she
shall
keep
the
baby
there
the
time
the
nursery
i
mean
not
the
den
she
says
she
going
to
teach
it
to
be
a
quiet
baby
and
hate
noise
she
says
she
thinks
she
can
do
it
humph
sniffed
aunt
hannah
scornfully
you
should
have
seen
marie
disgust
the
other
day
went
on
billy
a
bit
mischievously
her
cousin
jane
sent
on
a
rattle
she
made
herself
all
soft
worsted
with
bells
inside
it
was
a
dear
but
marie
was
baby
have
a
rattle
she
cried
what
would
cyril
say
as
if
he
could
stand
a
rattle
in
the
house
and
if
she
did
give
that
rattle
to
the
janitor
wife
that
very
day
while
i
was
there
humph
sniffed
aunt
hannah
again
as
billy
rose
to
go
well
thinking
marie
has
still
some
things
to
learn
in
this
world
and
cyril
too
for
that
i
would
wonder
laughed
billy
giving
aunt
hannah
a
kiss
chapter
xiii
pete
bertram
henshaw
had
no
disquieting
forebodings
this
time
concerning
his
portrait
of
marguerite
winthrop
when
the
doors
of
the
bohemian
ten
club
exhibition
were
thrown
open
to
members
and
invited
guests
just
how
great
a
popular
success
it
was
destined
to
be
he
could
not
know
of
course
though
he
might
have
suspected
it
when
he
began
to
receive
the
admiring
and
hearty
congratulations
of
his
friends
and
on
that
first
evening
nor
was
the
winthrop
portrait
the
only
jewel
in
his
crown
on
that
occasion
his
marvelously
exquisite
the
rose
and
his
smaller
ideal
picture
expectation
came
in
for
scarcely
less
commendation
there
was
no
doubt
now
the
originator
of
the
famous
face
of
a
girl
had
come
into
his
own
again
on
all
sides
this
was
the
verdict
one
critic
of
international
fame
even
claiming
openly
that
henshaw
had
not
only
equaled
his
former
best
work
but
had
gone
beyond
it
in
both
artistry
and
technique
it
was
a
brilliant
gathering
society
as
usual
in
costly
evening
gowns
and
correct
rubbed
elbows
with
names
famous
in
the
world
of
art
and
letters
everywhere
were
gay
laughter
and
sparkling
repartee
even
the
winthrop
unbent
to
the
extent
of
grim
smiles
in
response
to
the
laudatory
comments
bestowed
upon
the
pictured
image
of
his
idol
his
beautiful
daughter
as
to
the
great
financier
own
opinion
of
the
work
no
one
heard
him
express
it
except
perhaps
the
artist
and
all
that
he
got
was
a
grip
of
the
hand
and
a
good
i
knew
you
fetch
it
this
time
my
boy
but
that
was
enough
and
indeed
no
one
who
knew
the
stern
old
man
needed
to
more
than
look
into
his
face
that
evening
to
know
of
his
entire
satisfaction
in
this
portrait
soon
to
be
the
most
recent
and
the
most
cherished
addition
to
his
art
collection
as
to
bertram
bertram
was
pleased
and
happy
and
gratified
of
course
as
was
natural
but
he
was
not
one
whit
more
so
than
was
bertram
wife
billy
fairly
radiated
happiness
and
proud
joy
she
told
bertram
indeed
that
if
he
did
anything
to
make
her
any
prouder
it
would
take
an
annex
the
size
of
the
boston
opera
house
to
hold
her
extra
happiness
billy
some
one
will
hear
you
protested
bertram
tragically
but
in
spite
of
his
horrified
voice
he
did
not
look
displeased
for
the
first
time
billy
met
marguerite
winthrop
that
evening
at
the
outset
there
was
just
a
bit
of
shyness
and
constraint
in
the
young
wife
manner
billy
could
not
forget
her
old
insane
jealousy
of
this
beautiful
girl
with
the
envied
name
of
marguerite
but
it
was
for
only
a
moment
and
soon
she
was
her
natural
charming
self
miss
winthrop
was
fascinated
and
she
made
no
pretense
of
hiding
it
she
even
turned
to
bertram
at
last
and
cried
surely
now
henshaw
you
need
never
go
far
for
a
model
why
you
paint
your
wife
billy
colored
bertram
smiled
i
have
he
said
i
have
painted
her
many
times
in
fact
i
have
painted
her
so
often
that
she
once
declared
it
was
only
the
tilt
of
her
chin
and
the
turn
of
her
head
that
i
loved
to
paint
he
said
merrily
enjoying
billy
pretty
confusion
and
not
realizing
that
his
words
really
distressed
her
i
have
a
whole
studio
full
of
at
oh
have
you
really
questioned
miss
winthrop
eagerly
then
i
see
them
may
i
please
henshaw
i
so
love
to
why
of
course
you
may
murmured
both
the
artist
and
his
wife
thank
you
then
i
coming
right
away
may
i
i
going
to
washington
next
week
you
see
will
you
let
me
come
at
at
three
then
will
it
be
quite
convenient
for
you
henshaw
quite
convenient
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
smiled
billy
and
bertram
echoed
his
wife
cordial
permission
thank
you
then
i
be
there
at
three
nodded
miss
winthrop
with
a
smile
as
she
turned
to
give
place
to
an
admiring
group
who
were
waiting
to
pay
their
respects
to
the
artist
and
his
wife
there
was
after
all
that
evening
one
fly
in
billy
ointment
it
fluttered
in
at
the
behest
of
an
old
acquaintance
one
of
the
advice
women
as
billy
termed
some
of
her
too
interested
friends
well
they
lovely
perfectly
lovely
of
course
henshaw
said
this
lady
coming
up
to
say
but
all
the
same
glad
my
husband
is
just
a
plain
lawyer
look
out
my
dear
that
while
henshaw
is
stealing
all
those
pretty
faces
for
his
canvases
just
look
out
that
the
fair
ladies
do
turn
around
and
steal
his
heart
before
you
know
it
dear
me
but
you
must
be
so
proud
of
him
i
am
smiled
billy
serenely
and
only
the
jagged
split
that
rent
the
glove
on
her
hand
at
that
moment
told
of
the
fierce
anger
behind
that
smile
as
if
i
could
trust
bertram
raged
billy
passionately
to
herself
stealing
a
surreptitious
glance
at
her
ruined
glove
and
as
if
there
were
ever
any
perfectly
happy
marriages
even
if
you
do
ever
hear
of
them
or
read
of
them
bertram
was
not
home
to
luncheon
on
the
day
following
the
opening
night
of
the
bohemian
ten
club
a
matter
of
business
called
him
away
from
the
house
early
in
the
morning
but
he
told
his
wife
that
he
surely
would
be
on
hand
for
miss
winthrop
call
at
three
that
afternoon
yes
do
billy
had
urged
i
think
she
lovely
but
you
know
her
so
much
better
than
i
do
that
i
want
you
here
besides
you
need
think
going
to
show
her
all
those
billys
of
yours
i
may
be
vain
but
i
not
quite
vain
enough
for
that
sir
do
worry
her
husband
had
laughed
i
be
as
it
chanced
however
something
occurred
an
hour
before
three
that
drove
every
thought
of
miss
winthrop
call
from
billy
head
for
three
days
now
pete
had
been
at
the
home
of
his
niece
in
south
boston
he
had
been
forced
finally
to
give
up
and
go
away
news
from
him
the
day
before
had
been
anything
but
reassuring
and
bertram
being
gone
billy
had
suggested
that
eliza
serve
a
simple
luncheon
and
go
immediately
afterward
to
south
boston
to
see
how
her
uncle
was
this
suggestion
eliza
had
followed
leaving
the
house
at
one
shortly
after
two
calderwell
had
dropped
in
to
bring
bertram
as
he
expressed
it
a
bunch
of
bouquets
he
had
gathered
at
the
picture
show
the
night
before
he
was
still
in
the
chatting
with
billy
when
the
telephone
bell
rang
if
that
bertram
tell
him
to
come
home
he
got
company
laughed
calderwell
as
billy
passed
into
the
hall
a
moment
later
he
heard
billy
give
a
startled
cry
followed
by
a
few
broken
words
at
short
intervals
then
before
he
could
surmise
what
had
happened
she
was
back
in
the
again
her
eyes
full
of
tears
it
pete
she
choked
eliza
says
he

few
minutes

he
finished

sobbed
billy
stumbling
blindly
toward
the
stairway
i
be
ready
in
two
and
she
was
but
neither
then
nor
a
little
later
when
she
and
calderwell
drove
hurriedly
away
from
the
house
did
billy
once
remember
that
miss
marguerite
winthrop
was
coming
to
call
that
afternoon
to
see
bertram
henshaw
and
a
roomful
of
billy
pictures
pete
was
still
alive
when
calderwell
left
billy
at
the
door
of
the
modest
little
home
where
eliza
mother
lived
yes
you
in
time
sobbed
eliza
and
oh
i
so
glad
come
he
been
askin
and
askin
for
from
eliza
billy
learned
then
that
william
was
there
but
not
bertram
they
had
not
been
able
to
reach
bertram
or
cyril
billy
never
forgot
the
look
of
reverent
adoration
that
came
into
eyes
as
she
entered
the
room
where
he
lay
miss
billy
my
miss
billy
you
were
so
come
he
whispered
faintly
billy
choked
back
a
sob
of
course
i
come
pete
she
said
gently
taking
one
of
the
thin
worn
hands
into
both
her
soft
ones
it
was
more
than
a
few
minutes
that
pete
lived
four
came
and
five
and
he
was
still
with
them
often
he
opened
his
eyes
and
smiled
sometimes
he
spoke
a
low
word
to
william
or
billy
or
to
one
of
the
weeping
women
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
that
the
presence
of
his
beloved
master
and
mistress
meant
much
to
him
was
plain
to
be
seen
i
so
sorry
he
faltered
once
about
that
pretty
dress
i
spoiled
miss
billy
but
you
know
my
hands
i
know
i
know
soothed
billy
but
do
worry
it
was
spoiled
pete
it
all
fixed
oh
i
so
glad
sighed
the
sick
man
after
another
long
interval
of
silence
he
turned
to
william
them
socks
the
medium
thin
ones
you
oughter
be
puttin
on
soon
sir
now
they
in
the
corner
of
the
bottom
drawer
you
yes
pete
i
attend
to
it
william
managed
to
stammer
after
he
had
cleared
his
throat
eliza
turn
came
next
remember
about
the
coffee
pete
said
to
her
the
way
william
likes
it
and
always
eggs
you
know
for
for
his
voice
trailed
into
an
indistinct
murmur
and
his
eyelids
drooped
wearily
one
by
one
the
minutes
passed
the
doctor
came
and
went
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
at
five
the
thin
old
face
became
again
alight
with
consciousness
there
was
a
message
for
bertram
and
one
for
cyril
aunt
hannah
was
remembered
and
even
little
tommy
dunn
then
gradually
a
gray
shadow
crept
over
the
wasted
features
the
words
came
more
brokenly
the
mind
plainly
was
wandering
for
old
pete
was
young
again
and
around
him
were
the
lads
he
loved
william
cyril
and
bertram
and
then
very
quietly
soon
after
the
clock
struck
six
pete
fell
into
the
beginning
of
his
long
sleep
chapter
xiv
when
bertram
came
home
it
was
a
little
after
three
that
afternoon
when
bertram
henshaw
hurried
up
beacon
street
toward
his
home
he
had
been
delayed
and
he
feared
that
miss
winthrop
would
already
have
reached
the
house
mindful
of
what
billy
had
said
that
morning
he
knew
how
his
wife
would
fret
if
he
were
not
there
when
the
guest
arrived
the
sight
of
what
he
surmised
to
be
miss
winthrop
limousine
before
his
door
hastened
his
steps
still
more
but
as
he
reached
the
house
he
was
surprised
to
find
miss
winthrop
herself
turning
away
from
the
door
why
miss
winthrop
he
cried
you
not
going
you
ca
have
been
here
any
yet
well
no
i
i
have
retorted
the
lady
with
heightened
color
and
a
somewhat
peculiar
emphasis
my
ring
was
was
answered
bertram
reddened
angrily
why
what
can
that
mean
where
the
maid
where
my
wife
henshaw
must
be
here
she
was
expecting
bertram
in
his
annoyed
amazement
spoke
loudly
vehemently
hence
he
was
quite
plainly
heard
by
the
group
of
small
boys
and
girls
who
had
been
improving
the
mild
weather
for
a
frolic
on
the
sidewalk
and
who
had
been
attracted
to
his
door
a
moment
before
by
the
shining
magnet
of
the
winthrop
limousine
with
its
resplendently
liveried
chauffeur
as
bertram
spoke
one
of
the
small
girls
bessie
bailey
stepped
forward
and
piped
up
a
shrill
reply
she
ai
henshaw
she
ai
here
i
saw
her
go
away
just
a
little
while
bertram
turned
sharply
you
saw
her
go
away
what
do
you
mean
small
bessie
swelled
with
importance
bessie
was
thirteen
in
spite
of
her
diminutive
height
bessie
mother
was
dead
and
bessie
caretakers
were
gossiping
nurses
and
servants
who
frequently
left
in
her
way
books
that
were
much
too
old
for
bessie
to
read
but
she
read
them
i
mean
she
ai
here
your
wife
henshaw
she
went
away
i
saw
her
i
guess
likely
she
eloped
eloped
bessie
swelled
still
more
importantly
to
her
experienced
eyes
the
situation
contained
all
the
necessary
elements
for
the
customary
flight
of
the
heroine
in
her
as
here
now
was
the
irate
deserted
husband
sure
and
was
just
before
you
came
quite
a
while
before
a
big
shiny
black
automobile
like
this
drove
up
only
it
was
quite
such
a
nice
one
an
henshaw
an
a
man
came
out
of
your
house
an
got
in
drove
right
away
they
just
ran
to
get
into
it
too
they
she
appealed
to
her
young
mates
grouped
about
her
a
chorus
of
shrill
exclamations
brought
bertram
henshaw
suddenly
to
his
senses
by
a
desperate
effort
he
hid
his
angry
annoyance
as
he
turned
to
the
manifestly
embarrassed
young
woman
who
was
already
descending
the
steps
my
dear
miss
winthrop
he
apologized
contritely
i
sure
you
forgive
this
seeming
great
rudeness
on
the
part
of
my
wife
notwithstanding
the
lurid
tales
of
our
young
friends
here
i
suspect
nothing
more
serious
has
happened
than
that
my
wife
has
been
hastily
summoned
to
aunt
hannah
perhaps
or
of
course
she
may
not
have
understood
that
you
were
coming
at
three
though
i
thought
she
did
but
i
so
sorry
when
you
were
so
kind
as
to
come
miss
winthrop
interrupted
with
a
quick
gesture
say
no
more
i
beg
of
you
she
entreated
mrs
henshaw
is
quite
excusable
i
sure
please
do
give
it
another
thought
she
finished
as
with
a
hurried
direction
to
the
man
who
was
holding
open
the
door
of
her
car
she
stepped
inside
and
bowed
her
bertram
with
stern
forced
himself
to
walk
nonchalantly
up
his
steps
leisurely
take
out
his
key
and
open
his
door
under
the
interested
eyes
of
bessie
bailey
and
her
friends
but
once
beyond
their
hateful
stare
his
demeanor
underwent
a
complete
change
throwing
aside
his
hat
and
coat
he
strode
to
the
telephone
oh
is
that
you
aunt
hannah
he
called
crisply
a
moment
later
well
if
billy
there
will
you
tell
her
i
want
to
speak
to
her
please
billy
answered
aunt
hannah
slow
gentle
tones
why
my
dear
boy
billy
is
here
she
is
well
when
did
she
leave
she
been
there
has
she
why
i
do
think
so
but
i
see
if
you
like
greggory
and
i
have
just
this
minute
come
in
from
an
automobile
ride
we
would
have
stayed
longer
but
it
began
to
get
chilly
and
i
forgot
to
take
one
of
the
shawls
that
i
laid
yes
well
if
you
will
see
please
if
billy
has
been
there
and
when
she
left
said
bertram
with
grim
all
right
i
see
murmured
aunt
hannah
in
a
few
moments
her
voice
again
sounded
across
the
wires
why
no
bertram
rosa
says
she
been
here
since
yesterday
is
she
there
somewhere
about
the
house
did
you
know
where
she
was
going
well
no
i
did
else
i
should
have
been
asking
you
snapped
the
irate
bertram
and
hung
up
the
receiver
with
most
rude
haste
thereby
cutting
off
an
astounded
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
in
the
middle
of
it
the
next
ten
minutes
bertram
spent
in
going
through
the
whole
house
from
garret
to
basement
needless
to
say
he
found
nothing
to
enlighten
him
or
to
soothe
his
temper
four
came
then
and
five
at
five
bertram
began
to
look
for
eliza
but
in
vain
at
five
he
watched
for
william
but
william
too
did
not
come
bertram
was
pacing
the
floor
now
nervously
he
was
a
little
frightened
but
more
mortified
and
angry
that
billy
should
have
allowed
miss
winthrop
to
call
by
appointment
only
to
find
no
hostess
no
message
no
maid
even
to
answer
her
ring
it
was
inexcusable
impulsiveness
unconventionality
and
girlish
irresponsibility
were
all
very
delightful
of
course
at
times
but
not
now
certainly
billy
was
not
a
girl
any
longer
she
was
a
married
woman
was
due
to
him
her
husband
a
pretty
picture
he
must
have
made
on
those
steps
trying
to
apologize
for
a
truant
wife
and
to
laugh
off
that
absurd
bessie
bailey
preposterous
assertion
at
the
same
time
what
would
miss
winthrop
think
what
could
she
think
bertram
fairly
ground
his
teeth
with
chagrin
at
the
situation
in
which
he
found
himself
nor
were
matters
helped
any
by
the
fact
that
bertram
was
hungry
bertram
luncheon
had
been
meager
and
unsatisfying
that
the
kitchen
still
remained
in
silent
spotless
order
instead
of
being
astir
with
the
sounds
and
smells
of
a
good
dinner
as
it
should
have
been
did
not
improve
his
temper
where
billy
was
he
could
not
imagine
he
thought
once
or
twice
of
calling
up
some
of
her
friends
but
something
held
him
back
from
that
though
he
did
try
to
get
marie
knowing
very
well
that
she
was
probably
over
to
the
new
house
and
would
not
answer
he
was
not
surprised
therefore
when
he
received
no
reply
to
his
ring
that
there
was
the
slightest
truth
in
bessie
bailey
absurd
elopement
idea
bertram
did
not
of
course
for
an
instant
believe
the
only
thing
that
rankled
about
that
was
the
fact
that
she
had
suggested
such
a
thing
and
that
miss
winthrop
and
those
silly
children
had
heard
her
he
recognized
half
of
bessie
friends
as
neighborhood
youngsters
and
he
knew
very
well
that
there
would
be
many
a
quiet
laugh
at
his
expense
around
various
beacon
street
that
night
at
the
thought
of
those
he
scowled
again
had
no
at
least
he
had
no
dinner
on
it
who
the
man
might
be
bertram
thought
he
could
easily
guess
it
was
either
arkwright
or
calderwell
of
course
and
probably
that
tiresome
alice
greggory
was
mixed
up
in
it
somehow
he
did
wish
billy
six
came
then
bertram
was
indeed
frightened
now
but
he
was
more
angry
and
still
more
hungry
he
had
in
fact
reached
that
state
of
blind
unreasonableness
said
to
be
peculiar
to
hungry
males
from
time
immemorial
at
ten
minutes
of
seven
a
key
clicked
in
the
lock
of
the
outer
door
and
william
and
billy
entered
the
hall
it
was
almost
dark
bertram
could
not
see
their
faces
he
had
not
lighted
the
hall
at
all
well
he
began
sharply
is
this
the
way
you
receive
your
callers
billy
i
came
home
and
found
miss
winthrop
just
leaving
no
one
here
to
receive
her
where
you
been
where
eliza
where
my
dinner
of
course
i
do
mean
to
scold
billy
but
there
is
a
limit
to
even
my
patience
and
it
reached
now
i
ca
help
suggesting
that
if
you
would
tend
to
your
husband
and
your
home
a
little
more
and
go
gallivanting
off
with
calderwell
and
arkwright
and
alice
greggory
a
little
less
that
where
is
eliza
anyway
he
finished
irritably
switching
on
the
lights
with
a
snap
there
was
a
moment
of
dead
silence
at
bertram
first
words
billy
and
william
had
stopped
short
neither
had
moved
since
now
william
turned
and
began
to
speak
but
billy
interrupted
she
met
her
husband
gaze
steadily
i
will
be
down
at
once
to
get
your
dinner
she
said
quietly
eliza
will
not
come
pete
is
bertram
started
forward
with
a
quick
cry
dead
oh
billy
then
you
were
billy
but
his
wife
did
not
apparently
hear
him
she
passed
him
without
turning
her
head
and
went
on
up
the
stairs
leaving
him
to
meet
the
sorrowful
accusing
eyes
of
william
chapter
xv
after
the
storm
the
young
husband
apologies
were
profuse
and
abject
bertram
was
heartily
ashamed
of
himself
and
was
man
enough
to
acknowledge
it
almost
on
his
knees
he
begged
billy
to
forgive
him
and
in
a
frenzy
of
he
followed
her
down
into
the
kitchen
that
night
piteously
beseeching
her
to
speak
to
him
to
just
at
him
even
so
that
he
might
know
he
was
not
utterly
despised
though
he
did
indeed
deserve
to
be
more
than
despised
he
moaned
at
first
billy
did
not
speak
or
even
vouchsafe
a
glance
in
his
direction
very
quietly
she
went
about
her
preparations
for
a
simple
meal
paying
apparently
no
more
attention
to
bertram
than
as
if
he
were
not
there
but
that
her
ears
were
only
seemingly
and
not
really
deaf
was
shown
very
clearly
a
little
later
when
at
a
particularly
abject
wail
on
the
part
of
the
babbling
shadow
at
her
heels
billy
choked
into
a
little
gasp
half
laughter
half
sob
it
was
all
over
then
bertram
had
her
in
his
arms
in
a
twinkling
while
to
the
floor
clattered
and
rolled
a
knife
and
a
baked
potato
naturally
after
that
there
could
be
no
more
dignified
silences
on
the
part
of
the
injured
wife
there
were
instead
tears
sobs
a
tremulous
telling
of
pete
going
and
his
messages
followed
by
a
tearful
listening
to
bertram
story
of
the
torture
he
had
endured
at
the
hands
of
miss
winthrop
bessie
bailey
and
an
empty
dinnerless
house
and
thus
in
one
corner
of
the
kitchen
some
time
later
a
hungry
desperate
william
found
them
the
cold
baked
potato
still
at
their
feet
torn
between
his
craving
for
food
and
his
desire
not
to
interfere
with
any
possible
william
was
obviously
hesitating
what
to
do
when
billy
glanced
up
and
saw
him
she
saw
too
at
the
same
time
the
empty
blazing
burner
and
the
pile
of
potatoes
to
warm
which
the
burner
had
long
since
been
lighted
with
a
little
cry
she
broke
away
from
her
husband
arms
mercy
and
here
poor
uncle
william
bless
his
heart
with
not
a
thing
to
eat
yet
they
all
got
dinner
then
together
with
many
a
sigh
and
tear
as
everywhere
they
met
some
sad
reminder
of
the
gentle
old
hands
that
would
never
again
minister
to
their
comfort
it
was
a
silent
meal
and
little
after
all
was
eaten
though
brave
attempts
at
cheerfulness
and
naturalness
were
made
by
all
three
bertram
especially
talked
and
tried
to
make
sure
that
the
shadow
on
billy
face
was
at
least
not
the
one
his
own
conduct
had
brought
there
for
you
do
you
surely
do
forgive
me
do
you
he
begged
as
he
followed
her
into
the
kitchen
after
the
sorry
meal
was
over
why
yes
dear
yes
sighed
billy
trying
to
smile
and
you
forget
there
was
no
answer
billy
and
you
forget
bertram
voice
was
insistent
reproachful
billy
changed
color
and
bit
her
lip
she
looked
plainly
distressed
billy
cried
the
man
still
more
reproachfully
but
bertram
i
ca
forget
quite
yet
faltered
billy
bertram
frowned
for
a
minute
he
looked
as
if
he
were
about
to
take
up
the
matter
seriously
and
argue
it
with
her
but
the
next
moment
he
smiled
and
tossed
his
head
with
jaunty
playfulness
bertram
to
tell
the
truth
had
now
had
quite
enough
of
what
he
privately
termed
scenes
and
heroics
and
manlike
he
was
very
ardently
longing
for
the
old
friendliness
with
all
unpleasantness
banished
to
oblivion
oh
but
you
have
to
forget
he
claimed
with
cheery
insistence
for
you
promised
to
forgive
me
and
one
ca
forgive
without
forgetting
so
there
he
finished
with
a
smilingly
determined
air
billy
made
no
response
she
turned
hurriedly
and
began
to
busy
herself
with
the
dishes
at
the
sink
in
her
heart
she
was
wondering
could
she
ever
forget
what
bertram
had
said
would
anything
ever
blot
out
those
awful
words
if
you
would
tend
to
your
husband
and
your
home
a
little
more
and
go
gallivanting
off
with
calderwell
and
arkwright
and
alice
greggory
a
little
less
it
seemed
now
that
always
for
evermore
they
would
ring
in
her
ears
always
for
evermore
they
would
burn
deeper
and
deeper
into
her
soul
and
not
once
in
all
bertram
apologies
had
he
referred
to
them
those
words
he
had
uttered
he
had
not
said
he
did
not
mean
them
he
had
not
said
he
was
sorry
he
spoke
them
he
had
ignored
them
and
he
expected
that
now
she
too
would
ignore
them
as
if
she
could
if
you
would
tend
to
your
husband
and
your
home
a
little
more
and
go
gallivanting
off
with
calderwell
and
arkwright
and
alice
greggory
a
little
less
oh
if
only
she
could
indeed
forget
when
billy
went
that
night
she
ran
across
her
talk
to
young
wives
in
her
desk
with
a
cry
she
thrust
it
far
back
out
of
sight
i
hate
you
i
hate
you
with
all
your
old
talk
about
up
against
outside
interests
she
whispered
fiercely
well
and
now
see
what
i
got
for
it
later
however
after
bertram
was
asleep
billy
crept
out
of
bed
and
got
the
book
under
the
carefully
shaded
lamp
in
the
adjoining
room
she
turned
the
pages
softly
till
she
came
to
the
sentence
perhaps
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
more
utterly
unreasonable
irritable
irresponsible
creature
than
a
hungry
with
a
long
sigh
she
began
to
read
and
not
until
some
minutes
later
did
she
close
the
book
turn
off
the
light
and
steal
back
to
bed
during
the
next
three
days
until
after
the
funeral
at
the
shabby
little
south
boston
house
eliza
spent
only
about
half
of
each
day
at
the
strata
this
much
to
her
distress
left
many
of
the
household
tasks
for
her
young
mistress
to
perform
billy
however
attacked
each
new
duty
with
a
feverish
eagerness
that
seemed
to
make
the
performance
of
it
very
like
some
glad
penance
done
for
past
misdeeds
and
when
on
the
day
after
they
had
laid
the
old
servant
in
his
last
resting
place
a
despairing
message
came
from
eliza
to
the
effect
that
now
her
mother
was
very
ill
and
would
need
her
care
billy
promptly
told
eliza
to
stay
as
long
as
was
necessary
that
they
could
get
along
all
right
without
her
but
billy
what
we
going
to
do
bertram
demanded
when
he
heard
the
news
we
must
have
somebody
going
to
do
nonsense
as
if
you
could
scoffed
bertram
billy
lifted
her
chin
could
i
indeed
she
retorted
do
you
realize
young
man
how
much
i
done
the
last
three
days
how
about
those
muffins
you
had
this
morning
for
breakfast
and
that
cake
last
night
and
did
you
yourself
say
that
you
never
ate
a
better
pudding
than
that
date
puff
yesterday
noon
bertram
laughed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
my
dear
love
i
not
questioning
your
to
do
it
he
soothed
quickly
still
he
added
with
a
whimsical
smile
i
must
remind
you
that
eliza
has
been
here
half
the
time
and
that
muffins
and
date
puffs
however
delicious
are
all
there
is
to
running
a
big
house
like
this
besides
just
be
sensible
billy
he
went
on
more
seriously
as
he
noted
the
rebellious
gleam
coming
into
his
young
wife
eyes
know
you
could
do
it
if
you
just
stop
to
think
there
the
carletons
coming
to
dinner
monday
and
my
studio
tea
to
say
nothing
of
the
symphony
and
the
opera
and
the
concerts
you
lose
because
you
were
too
dead
tired
to
go
to
them
you
know
how
it
was
with
that
concert
yesterday
afternoon
which
alice
greggory
wanted
you
to
go
to
with
i
did
want
to
go
choked
billy
under
her
breath
and
there
your
music
you
have
done
a
thing
with
that
for
days
yet
only
last
week
you
told
me
the
publishers
were
hurrying
you
for
that
last
song
to
complete
the
i
have
felt
like
writing
stammered
billy
still
half
under
her
breath
of
course
you
have
triumphed
bertram
you
been
too
dead
tired
and
that
just
what
i
say
billy
you
do
it
all
yourself
but
i
want
to
i
want
to
to
tend
to
things
faltered
billy
with
a
glance
into
her
husband
face
billy
was
hearing
very
loudly
now
that
accusing
if
you
tend
to
your
husband
and
your
home
a
little
more
bertram
however
was
not
hearing
it
evidently
indeed
he
seemed
never
to
have
heard
it
much
less
to
have
spoken
it
to
things
he
laughed
lightly
well
you
have
enough
to
do
to
tend
to
the
maid
i
fancy
anyhow
we
going
to
have
one
i
just
step
into
one
of
those
what
do
you
call
intelligence
offices
on
my
way
down
and
send
one
up
he
finished
as
he
gave
his
wife
a
kiss
an
hour
later
billy
struggling
with
the
broom
and
the
carpet
was
called
to
the
telephone
it
was
her
husband
voice
that
came
to
her
billy
for
heaven
sake
take
pity
on
me
wo
you
put
on
your
duds
and
come
and
engage
your
maid
yourself
why
bertram
what
the
matter
matter
holy
smoke
well
i
been
to
three
of
those
intelligence
offices
though
why
they
call
them
that
i
ca
imagine
if
ever
there
was
a
place
utterly
devoid
of
never
mind
interviewed
four
fat
ladies
two
thin
ones
and
one
medium
with
a
wart
i
cheerfully
divulged
all
our
family
secrets
promised
every
other
out
and
taken
oath
that
our
household
numbers
three
adult
members
and
no
more
but
i
simply
remember
how
many
handkerchiefs
we
have
in
the
wash
each
week
billy
will
you
come
maybe
you
can
do
something
with
them
i
sure
you
can
why
of
course
i
come
chirped
billy
where
shall
i
meet
you
bertram
gave
the
street
and
number
good
i
be
there
promised
billy
as
she
hung
up
the
receiver
quite
forgetting
the
broom
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
billy
tripped
to
change
her
dress
on
her
lips
was
a
gay
little
song
in
her
heart
was
joy
i
rather
guess
i
tending
to
my
husband
and
my
home
she
was
crowing
to
herself
just
as
billy
was
about
to
leave
the
house
the
telephone
bell
jangled
again
it
was
alice
greggory
billy
dear
she
called
ca
you
come
out
arkwright
and
calderwell
are
here
and
they
brought
some
new
music
we
want
you
will
you
come
i
ca
dear
bertram
wants
me
he
sent
for
me
i
got
some
duties
to
perform
returned
billy
in
a
voice
so
curiously
triumphant
that
alice
at
her
end
of
the
wires
frowned
in
puzzled
wonder
as
she
turned
away
from
the
telephone
chapter
xvi
into
training
for
mary
ellen
bertram
told
a
friend
afterwards
that
he
never
knew
the
meaning
of
the
word
chaos
until
he
had
seen
the
strata
during
the
weeks
immediately
following
the
laying
away
of
his
old
servant
every
stratum
was
aquiver
with
apprehension
he
declared
and
there
was
never
any
telling
when
the
next
grand
upheaval
would
rock
the
whole
structure
to
its
nor
was
bertram
so
far
from
being
right
it
was
indeed
a
chaos
as
none
knew
better
than
did
bertram
wife
poor
billy
sorry
indeed
were
these
days
for
billy
and
as
if
to
make
her
cup
of
woe
full
to
overflowing
there
were
sister
kate
epistolary
i
told
you
so
and
aunt
hannah
ever
recurring
lament
if
only
billy
you
were
a
practical
housekeeper
yourself
they
would
impose
on
you
so
aunt
hannah
to
be
sure
offered
rosa
and
kate
by
letter
offered
advice
plenty
of
it
but
billy
stung
beyond
all
endurance
and
fairly
radiating
hurt
pride
and
dogged
determination
disdained
all
assistance
and
with
head
held
high
declared
she
was
getting
along
very
well
very
well
indeed
and
this
was
the
way
she
got
first
came
nora
nora
was
a
irish
girl
the
sixth
that
the
despairing
billy
had
interviewed
on
that
fateful
morning
when
bertram
had
summoned
her
to
his
aid
nora
stayed
two
days
during
her
reign
the
entire
strata
echoed
to
banged
doors
dropped
china
and
slammed
furniture
at
her
departure
the
henshaws
possessions
were
less
by
four
cups
two
saucers
one
plate
one
salad
bowl
two
cut
glass
tumblers
and
a
teapot
the
latter
william
choicest
bit
of
lowestoft
olga
came
next
olga
was
a
treasure
she
was
and
a
good
cook
she
stayed
a
week
by
that
time
the
growing
frequency
of
the
disappearance
of
sundry
small
articles
of
value
and
convenience
led
to
billy
making
a
reluctant
search
of
olga
room
and
to
departure
for
the
room
was
indeed
a
treasure
house
the
treasure
having
gathered
unto
itself
other
treasures
following
olga
came
a
period
of
what
bertram
called
one
night
stands
so
frequently
were
the
dramatis
personæ
below
stairs
changed
gretchen
drank
christine
knew
only
four
words
of
english
salt
no
and
yes
and
billy
found
need
occasionally
of
using
other
words
mary
was
impertinent
and
lazy
jennie
could
not
even
boil
a
potato
properly
much
less
cook
a
dinner
sarah
colored
was
willing
and
pleasant
but
insufferably
untidy
bridget
was
neatness
itself
but
she
had
no
conception
of
the
value
of
time
her
meals
were
always
from
thirty
to
sixty
minutes
late
and
at
that
vera
sang
when
she
was
whistling
and
as
she
was
generally
off
the
key
and
always
off
the
tune
her
almost
frantic
mistress
dismissed
her
before
hours
had
passed
then
came
mary
ellen
mary
ellen
began
well
she
was
neat
capable
and
obliging
but
it
did
not
take
her
long
to
discover
just
how
much
and
how
little
her
mistress
really
knew
of
practical
housekeeping
matters
and
things
were
very
different
then
mary
ellen
became
argumentative
impertinent
and
domineering
she
openly
shirked
her
work
when
it
pleased
her
so
to
do
and
demanded
perquisites
and
privileges
so
insolently
that
even
william
asked
billy
one
day
whether
mary
ellen
or
billy
herself
were
the
mistress
of
the
strata
and
bertram
with
mock
humility
inquired
how
mary
ellen
would
be
wanting
the
house
billy
in
weary
despair
submitted
to
this
bullying
for
almost
a
week
then
in
a
sudden
accession
of
outraged
dignity
that
left
mary
ellen
gasping
with
surprise
she
told
the
girl
to
go
and
thus
the
days
passed
the
maids
came
and
the
maids
went
and
to
billy
each
one
seemed
a
little
worse
than
the
one
before
nowhere
was
there
comfort
rest
or
peacefulness
the
nights
were
a
torture
of
apprehension
and
the
days
an
even
greater
torture
of
fulfilment
noise
confusion
meals
poorly
cooked
and
worse
served
dust
disorder
and
uncertainty
and
this
was
billy
told
herself
bitterly
no
wonder
that
bertram
telephoned
more
and
more
frequently
that
he
had
met
a
friend
and
was
dining
in
town
no
wonder
that
william
pushed
back
his
plate
almost
every
meal
with
his
food
scarcely
touched
and
then
wandered
about
the
house
with
that
hungry
homesick
homeless
look
that
nearly
broke
her
heart
no
wonder
indeed
and
so
it
had
come
it
was
true
aunt
hannah
and
kate
and
the
talk
to
young
wives
were
right
she
had
not
been
fit
to
marry
bertram
she
had
not
been
fit
to
marry
anybody
her
honeymoon
was
not
only
waning
but
going
into
a
total
eclipse
had
not
bertram
already
declared
that
if
she
would
tend
to
her
husband
and
her
home
a
little
more
billy
clenched
her
small
hands
and
set
her
round
chin
squarely
very
well
she
would
show
them
she
would
tend
to
her
husband
and
her
home
she
fancied
she
could
to
run
that
house
and
run
it
well
and
forthwith
she
descended
to
the
kitchen
and
told
the
then
reigning
tormentor
that
her
wages
would
be
paid
until
the
end
of
the
week
but
that
her
services
would
be
immediately
dispensed
with
billy
was
well
aware
now
that
housekeeping
was
a
matter
of
more
than
muffins
and
date
puffs
she
could
gauge
in
a
measure
the
magnitude
of
the
task
to
which
she
had
set
herself
but
she
did
not
falter
and
very
systematically
she
set
about
making
her
plans
with
a
good
stout
woman
to
come
in
twice
a
week
for
the
heavier
work
she
believed
she
could
manage
by
herself
very
well
until
eliza
could
come
back
at
least
she
could
serve
more
palatable
meals
than
the
most
of
those
that
had
appeared
lately
and
at
least
she
could
try
to
make
a
home
that
would
not
drive
bertram
to
club
dinners
and
uncle
william
to
hungry
wanderings
from
room
to
room
meanwhile
all
the
time
she
could
be
learning
and
in
due
course
she
would
reach
that
shining
goal
of
housekeeping
efficiency
short
of
which
according
to
aunt
hannah
and
the
talk
to
young
wives
no
woman
need
hope
for
a
waneless
honeymoon
so
chaotic
and
erratic
had
been
the
household
service
and
so
quietly
did
billy
slip
into
her
new
role
that
it
was
not
until
the
second
meal
after
the
maid
departure
that
the
master
of
the
house
discovered
what
had
happened
then
as
his
wife
rose
to
get
some
forgotten
article
he
questioned
with
uplifted
eyebrows
too
good
to
wait
upon
us
is
my
lady
now
eh
my
lady
is
waiting
on
you
smiled
billy
yes
i
see
lady
is
retorted
bertram
grimly
but
i
mean
our
real
lady
in
the
kitchen
great
scott
billy
how
long
are
you
going
to
stand
this
billy
tossed
her
head
airily
though
she
shook
in
her
shoes
billy
had
been
dreading
this
moment
i
not
standing
it
she
gone
responded
billy
cheerfully
resuming
her
seat
uncle
william
i
give
you
some
more
pudding
gone
so
soon
groaned
bertram
as
william
passed
his
plate
with
a
smiling
nod
oh
well
went
on
bertram
resignedly
she
stayed
longer
than
the
last
one
when
is
the
next
one
coming
she
already
bertram
frowned
here
but
you
served
the
dessert
and
at
something
in
face
a
quick
suspicion
came
into
his
own
billy
you
do
mean
that
you
yes
she
nodded
brightly
that
just
what
i
mean
i
the
next
nonsense
exploded
bertram
wrathfully
oh
come
billy
we
been
all
over
this
before
you
know
i
ca
have
yes
you
can
you
got
to
have
it
retorted
billy
still
with
that
disarming
airy
cheerfulness
besides
be
half
so
bad
as
you
think
was
that
a
good
pudding
did
you
both
come
back
for
more
well
i
made
puddings
ejaculated
bertram
with
an
impatient
gesture
billy
as
i
said
before
it
takes
something
besides
puddings
to
run
this
yes
i
know
it
does
dimpled
billy
and
i
got
durgin
for
that
part
she
coming
twice
a
week
and
more
if
i
need
her
why
dearie
you
do
know
anything
about
how
comfortable
you
going
to
be
leave
it
to
uncle
william
if
but
uncle
william
had
gone
silently
he
had
slipped
from
his
chair
and
disappeared
uncle
william
it
might
be
mentioned
in
passing
had
never
quite
forgotten
aunt
hannah
fateful
call
with
its
dire
revelations
concerning
a
certain
unwanted
superfluous
brother
remembering
this
there
were
times
when
he
thought
absence
was
both
safest
and
best
this
was
one
of
the
times
but
billy
dear
still
argued
bertram
irritably
how
can
you
you
do
know
how
you
had
no
billy
threw
back
her
shoulders
an
ominous
light
came
to
her
eyes
she
was
no
longer
airily
playful
that
exactly
it
bertram
i
do
know
how
but
i
going
to
learn
i
have
had
experience
but
i
going
to
get
it
i
make
a
worse
mess
of
it
than
we
had
ever
since
eliza
went
anyway
but
if
you
get
a
maid
a
good
maid
persisted
bertram
feebly
i
had
mary
ellen
she
was
a
good
maid
until
she
found
out
how
little
her
mistress
knew
then
well
you
know
what
it
was
then
do
you
think
i
let
that
thing
happen
to
me
again
no
sir
i
going
into
training
for
my
next
mary
ellen
and
with
a
very
majestic
air
billy
rose
from
the
table
and
began
to
clear
away
the
dishes
chapter
xvii
the
efficiency
star
and
billy
billy
was
not
a
young
woman
that
did
things
by
halves
long
ago
in
the
days
of
her
childhood
her
aunt
ella
had
once
said
of
her
if
only
billy
did
go
into
things
all
over
so
but
whether
it
measles
or
mud
pies
i
always
know
that
she
be
the
measliest
or
the
muddiest
of
any
child
in
town
it
could
not
be
expected
therefore
that
billy
would
begin
to
play
her
new
rôle
now
with
any
lack
of
enthusiasm
but
even
had
she
needed
any
incentive
there
was
still
ever
ringing
in
her
ears
bertram
accusing
if
you
tend
to
your
husband
and
your
home
a
little
more
billy
still
declared
very
emphatically
that
she
had
forgiven
bertram
but
she
knew
in
her
heart
that
she
had
not
forgotten
certainly
as
the
days
passed
it
could
not
be
said
that
billy
was
not
tending
to
her
husband
and
her
home
from
morning
till
night
now
she
tended
to
nothing
else
she
seldom
touched
her
piano
save
to
dust
it
and
she
never
touched
her
long
since
banished
to
the
oblivion
of
the
music
cabinet
she
made
no
calls
except
occasional
flying
visits
to
the
annex
or
to
the
pretty
new
home
where
marie
and
cyril
were
now
delightfully
settled
the
opera
and
the
symphony
were
over
for
the
season
but
even
had
they
not
been
billy
could
not
have
attended
them
she
had
no
time
surely
she
was
not
doing
any
gallivanting
now
she
told
herself
sometimes
a
little
aggrievedly
there
was
indeed
no
time
from
morning
until
night
billy
was
busy
flying
from
one
task
to
another
her
ambition
to
have
everything
just
right
was
equalled
only
by
her
dogged
determination
to
just
show
them
that
she
could
do
this
thing
at
first
of
course
hampered
as
she
was
by
ignorance
and
inexperience
each
task
consumed
about
twice
as
much
time
as
was
necessary
yet
afterwards
when
accustomedness
had
brought
its
reward
of
speed
there
was
still
for
billy
no
time
for
increased
knowledge
had
only
opened
the
way
to
other
paths
untrodden
and
alluring
study
of
cookbooks
had
led
to
the
study
of
food
values
billy
discovered
suddenly
that
potatoes
beef
onions
oranges
and
puddings
were
something
besides
vegetables
meat
fruit
and
dessert
they
possessed
attributes
known
as
proteids
fats
and
carbohydrates
faint
memories
of
long
forgotten
school
days
hinted
that
these
terms
had
been
heard
before
but
never
billy
was
sure
had
she
fully
realized
what
they
meant
it
was
at
this
juncture
that
billy
ran
across
a
book
entitled
correct
eating
for
she
bought
it
at
once
and
carried
it
home
in
triumph
it
proved
to
be
a
marvelous
book
billy
had
not
read
two
chapters
before
she
began
to
wonder
how
the
family
had
managed
to
live
thus
far
with
any
sort
of
success
in
the
face
of
their
dense
ignorance
and
her
own
criminal
carelessness
concerning
their
daily
bill
of
fare
at
dinner
that
night
billy
told
bertram
and
william
of
her
discovery
and
with
growing
excitement
dilated
on
the
wonderful
good
that
it
was
to
bring
to
them
why
you
do
know
you
ca
imagine
what
a
treasure
it
is
she
exclaimed
it
gives
a
complete
table
for
the
exact
balancing
of
for
what
demanded
bertram
glancing
up
the
exact
balancing
of
food
and
this
book
says
that
the
biggest
problem
that
modern
scientists
have
to
humph
shrugged
bertram
well
you
just
balance
my
food
to
my
hunger
and
i
agree
not
to
oh
but
bertram
it
serious
really
urged
billy
looking
genuinely
distressed
why
it
says
that
what
you
eat
goes
to
make
up
what
you
are
it
makes
your
vital
energies
your
brain
power
and
your
body
power
come
from
what
you
eat
do
you
see
if
you
going
to
paint
a
picture
you
need
something
different
from
what
you
would
if
you
were
going
to
to
saw
wood
and
what
this
book
tells
is
is
what
i
ought
to
give
you
to
make
you
do
each
one
i
should
think
from
what
i
read
so
far
now
do
you
see
how
important
it
is
what
if
i
should
give
you
the
kind
of
a
breakfast
when
you
were
just
going
to
paint
all
day
and
what
if
i
should
give
uncle
william
a
a
breakfast
when
all
he
is
going
to
do
is
to
go
down
on
state
street
and
sit
still
all
day
but
but
my
dear
began
uncle
william
looking
slightly
worried
there
my
eggs
that
i
have
you
for
heaven
sake
billy
what
you
got
hold
of
now
demanded
bertram
with
just
a
touch
of
irritation
billy
laughed
merrily
well
i
suppose
i
did
sound
very
logical
she
admitted
but
the
book
you
just
wait
it
in
the
kitchen
i
going
to
get
and
with
laughing
eagerness
she
ran
from
the
room
in
a
moment
she
had
returned
book
in
hand
now
listen
is
the
real
thing
not
my
garbled
inaccuracies
food
which
we
eat
serves
three
purposes
it
builds
the
body
substance
bone
muscle
it
produces
heat
in
the
body
and
it
generates
vital
energy
nitrogen
in
different
chemical
combinations
contributes
largely
to
the
manufacture
of
body
substances
the
fats
produce
heat
and
the
starches
and
sugars
go
to
make
the
vital
energy
the
nitrogenous
food
elements
we
call
proteins
the
fats
and
oils
fats
and
the
starches
and
sugars
because
of
the
predominance
of
carbon
we
call
carbohydrates
now
in
selecting
the
diet
for
the
day
you
should
take
care
to
choose
those
foods
which
give
the
proteins
fats
and
carbohydrates
in
just
the
right
proportion
oh
billy
groaned
bertram
but
it
so
bertram
maintained
billy
anxiously
and
it
every
bit
here
i
do
have
to
guess
at
it
at
all
they
even
give
the
quantities
of
calories
of
energy
required
for
different
sized
men
i
going
to
measure
you
both
and
you
must
be
weighed
too
she
continued
ignoring
the
sniffs
of
remonstrance
from
her
two
listeners
then
i
know
just
how
many
calories
to
give
each
of
you
they
say
a
man
of
average
size
and
weight
and
sedentary
occupation
should
have
at
least
calories
and
some
authorities
say
in
this
proportion
proteins
calories
fats
calories
carbohydrates
calories
but
you
both
are
taller
than
five
feet
five
inches
and
i
should
think
you
weighed
more
than
pounds
so
i
ca
tell
just
yet
how
many
calories
you
will
how
many
we
will
need
indeed
ejaculated
bertram
but
my
dear
you
know
i
have
to
have
my
eggs
began
uncle
william
again
in
a
worried
voice
of
course
you
do
dear
and
you
shall
have
them
soothed
billy
brightly
it
only
that
i
have
to
be
careful
and
balance
up
the
other
things
for
the
day
accordingly
do
you
see
now
listen
see
what
eggs
she
turned
the
leaves
rapidly
here
the
food
table
it
lovely
it
tells
everything
i
never
saw
anything
so
wonderful
a
b
c
d
e
here
we
are
scrambled
or
boiled
fats
and
proteins
one
egg
if
it
poached
it
only
but
you
like
yours
boiled
so
we
have
to
reckon
on
the
and
you
always
have
two
so
that
means
calories
in
fats
and
proteins
now
do
you
see
if
you
ca
have
but
proteins
and
fats
all
day
and
already
eaten
in
your
two
eggs
that
leave
just
er
for
all
the
rest
of
the
day
of
fats
and
proteins
you
understand
and
no
idea
how
fast
that
count
up
why
just
one
serving
of
butter
is
of
fats
and
eight
almonds
is
another
while
a
serving
of
lentils
is
of
proteins
so
you
see
how
it
yes
i
see
murmured
uncle
william
casting
a
mournful
glance
about
the
generously
laden
table
much
as
if
he
were
bidding
farewell
to
a
departing
friend
but
if
i
should
want
more
to
eat
he
stopped
helplessly
and
bertram
aggrieved
voice
filled
the
pause
look
here
billy
if
you
think
i
going
to
be
measured
for
an
egg
and
weighed
for
an
almond
you
much
mistaken
because
i
not
i
want
to
eat
what
i
like
and
as
much
as
i
like
whether
it
six
calories
or
six
thousand
billy
chuckled
but
she
raised
her
hands
in
pretended
shocked
protest
six
thousand
mercy
bertram
i
do
know
what
would
happen
if
you
ate
that
quantity
but
i
sure
you
could
paint
you
just
have
to
saw
wood
and
dig
ditches
to
use
up
all
that
vital
humph
scoffed
bertram
besides
this
is
for
went
on
billy
with
an
earnest
air
this
man
owns
up
that
some
may
think
a
calory
ration
is
altogether
too
small
and
he
advises
such
to
begin
with
or
even
graded
of
course
according
to
a
man
size
weight
and
occupation
but
he
says
one
famous
man
does
splendid
work
on
only
calories
and
another
on
even
but
that
is
just
a
matter
of
chewing
why
bertram
you
have
no
idea
what
perfectly
wonderful
things
chewing
yes
i
heard
of
that
grunted
bertram
ten
chews
to
a
cherry
and
sixty
to
a
spoonful
of
soup
there
an
old
metronome
that
cyril
left
you
might
bring
it
down
and
set
it
going
on
the
table
so
many
ticks
to
a
mouthful
i
suppose
i
reckon
with
an
incentive
like
that
to
eat
just
about
two
calories
would
do
me
eh
william
bertram
now
you
only
making
fun
chided
billy
and
when
really
serious
too
now
listen
she
admonished
picking
up
the
book
again
a
man
consumes
a
large
amount
of
meat
and
very
few
vegetables
his
diet
will
be
too
rich
in
protein
and
too
lacking
in
carbohydrates
on
the
other
hand
if
he
consumes
great
quantities
of
pastry
bread
butter
and
tea
his
meals
will
furnish
too
much
energy
and
not
enough
building
material
there
bertram
do
you
see
oh
yes
i
see
teased
bertram
william
better
eat
what
you
can
i
foresee
it
the
last
meal
of
just
we
get
for
some
time
hereafter
we
have
proteins
fats
and
carbohydrates
made
into
calory
croquettes
and
bertram
scolded
billy
but
bertram
would
not
be
silenced
here
just
let
me
take
that
book
he
insisted
dragging
the
volume
from
billy
reluctant
fingers
now
william
listen
here
your
breakfast
morning
strawberries
calories
bread
calories
butter
calories
no
second
helping
mind
you
or
you
ruin
the
balance
and
something
would
topple
boiled
eggs
calories
cocoa
calories
which
all
comes
to
calories
sounds
like
an
english
bill
of
fare
with
a
new
kind
of
foreign
money
but
really
you
know
now
for
luncheon
you
can
have
tomato
soup
calories
potato
salad
that
cheap
only
calories
and
but
billy
pulled
the
book
away
then
and
in
righteous
indignation
carried
it
to
the
kitchen
you
do
deserve
anything
to
eat
she
declared
with
dignity
as
she
returned
to
the
no
queried
bertram
his
eyebrows
uplifted
well
as
near
as
i
can
make
out
we
are
going
to
get
but
billy
did
not
deign
to
answer
this
in
spite
of
bertram
tormenting
gibes
billy
did
for
some
days
arrange
her
meals
in
accordance
with
the
wonderful
table
of
food
given
in
correct
eating
for
to
be
sure
bertram
whatever
he
found
before
him
during
those
days
anxiously
asked
whether
he
were
eating
fats
proteins
or
carbohydrates
and
he
worried
openly
as
to
the
possibility
of
his
meal
producing
one
calory
too
much
or
too
little
thus
endangering
his
billy
alternately
laughed
and
scolded
to
the
unvarying
good
nature
of
her
husband
as
it
happened
however
even
this
was
not
for
long
for
billy
ran
across
a
magazine
article
on
food
adulteration
and
this
so
filled
her
with
terror
lest
in
the
food
served
she
were
killing
her
family
by
slow
poison
that
she
forgot
all
about
the
proteins
fats
and
carbohydrates
her
talk
these
days
was
of
formaldehyde
benzoate
of
soda
and
salicylic
acid
very
soon
too
billy
discovered
an
exclusive
back
bay
school
for
instruction
in
household
economics
and
domestic
hygiene
billy
investigated
it
at
once
and
was
immediately
aflame
with
enthusiasm
she
told
bertram
that
it
taught
everything
she
wanted
to
know
and
forthwith
she
enrolled
herself
as
one
of
its
most
devoted
pupils
in
spite
of
her
husband
protests
that
she
knew
enough
more
than
enough
already
this
school
attendance
to
her
consternation
billy
discovered
took
added
time
but
in
some
way
she
contrived
to
find
it
to
take
and
so
the
days
passed
eliza
mother
though
better
was
still
too
ill
for
her
daughter
to
leave
her
billy
as
the
warm
weather
approached
began
to
look
pale
and
thin
billy
to
tell
the
truth
was
working
altogether
too
hard
but
she
would
not
admit
it
even
to
herself
at
first
the
novelty
of
the
work
and
her
determination
to
conquer
at
all
costs
had
given
a
fictitious
strength
to
her
endurance
now
that
the
novelty
had
become
accustomedness
and
the
conquering
a
surety
billy
discovered
that
she
had
a
back
that
could
ache
and
limbs
that
at
times
could
almost
refuse
to
move
from
weariness
there
was
still
however
one
spur
that
never
failed
to
urge
her
to
fresh
endeavor
and
to
make
her
at
least
temporarily
forget
both
ache
and
weariness
and
that
was
the
comforting
thought
that
now
certainly
even
bertram
himself
must
admit
that
she
was
tending
to
her
home
and
her
husband
as
to
bertram
bertram
it
is
true
had
at
first
uttered
frequent
and
vehement
protests
against
his
wife
absorption
of
both
mind
and
body
in
that
plaguy
housework
as
he
termed
it
but
as
the
days
passed
and
blessed
order
superseded
chaos
peace
followed
discord
and
delicious
meals
took
the
place
of
the
horrors
that
had
been
called
meals
in
the
past
he
gradually
accepted
the
change
with
tranquil
satisfaction
and
forgot
to
question
how
it
was
brought
about
though
he
did
still
sometimes
rebel
because
billy
was
always
too
tired
or
too
busy
to
go
out
with
him
of
late
however
he
had
not
done
even
this
so
frequently
for
a
new
face
of
a
girl
had
possessed
his
soul
and
all
his
thoughts
and
most
of
his
time
had
gone
to
putting
on
canvas
the
vision
of
loveliness
that
his
mind
eye
saw
by
june
fifteenth
the
picture
was
finished
bertram
awoke
then
to
his
surroundings
he
found
summer
was
upon
him
with
no
plans
made
for
its
enjoyment
he
found
william
had
started
west
for
a
two
weeks
business
trip
but
what
he
did
not
find
one
day
at
least
at
first
was
his
wife
when
he
came
home
unexpectedly
at
four
and
bertram
especially
wanted
to
find
his
wife
that
day
for
he
had
met
three
people
whose
words
had
disquieted
him
not
a
little
first
aunt
hannah
she
had
said
bertram
where
is
billy
she
has
been
out
to
the
annex
for
a
week
and
the
last
time
she
was
there
she
looked
sick
i
was
real
worried
about
cyril
had
been
next
where
billy
he
had
asked
abruptly
marie
says
she
has
seen
her
for
two
weeks
marie
afraid
she
sick
she
says
billy
did
look
well
a
bit
when
she
did
see
calderwell
had
capped
the
climax
he
had
said
great
scott
henshaw
where
have
you
been
keeping
yourself
and
your
wife
not
one
of
us
has
caught
more
than
a
glimpse
of
her
for
weeks
she
has
sung
with
us
nor
played
for
us
nor
let
us
take
her
anywhere
for
a
month
of
sundays
even
miss
greggory
says
seen
much
of
her
and
that
billy
always
says
she
too
busy
to
go
anywhere
but
miss
greggory
says
she
looks
pale
and
thin
and
that
thinks
she
worrying
too
much
over
running
the
house
i
hope
she
sick
why
no
billy
is
sick
billy
all
right
bertram
had
answered
he
had
spoken
lightly
nonchalantly
with
an
elaborate
air
of
carelessness
but
after
he
had
left
calderwell
he
had
turned
his
steps
abruptly
and
a
little
hastily
toward
home
and
he
had
not
found
billy
at
least
not
at
once
he
had
gone
first
down
into
the
kitchen
and
he
remembered
then
uneasily
that
he
had
always
looked
for
billy
in
the
kitchen
and
of
late
however
she
was
not
there
on
the
kitchen
table
bertram
did
see
a
book
wide
open
and
mechanically
he
picked
it
up
it
was
a
cookbook
and
it
was
open
where
two
pages
bore
his
wife
handwriting
on
the
first
page
under
the
printed
heading
things
to
remember
he
read
these
sentences
that
rice
swells
till
every
dish
in
the
house
is
full
and
that
spinach
shrinks
till
you
ca
find
it
that
beets
boil
dry
if
you
look
out
the
window
that
biscuits
which
look
as
if
they
been
mixed
up
with
a
rusty
stove
poker
have
really
been
so
but
have
only
got
too
much
undissolved
soda
in
there
were
other
sentences
but
bertram
eyes
chanced
to
fall
on
the
opposite
page
where
the
things
to
remember
had
been
changed
to
things
to
forget
and
here
billy
had
written
just
four
words
burns
cuts
and
yesterday
bertram
dropped
the
book
then
with
a
spasmodic
clearing
of
his
throat
and
hurriedly
resumed
his
search
when
he
did
find
his
wife
at
last
he
gave
a
cry
of
dismay
she
was
on
her
own
bed
huddled
in
a
little
heap
and
shaking
with
sobs
billy
why
billy
he
gasped
striding
to
the
bedside
billy
sat
up
at
once
and
hastily
wiped
her
eyes
oh
is
it
you
i
did
hear
you
come
in
you
you
you
were
coming
till
six
she
choked
billy
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
i
i
guess
i
just
what
have
you
been
doing
bertram
spoke
sternly
almost
sharply
he
was
wondering
why
he
had
not
noticed
before
the
little
hollows
in
his
wife
cheeks
billy
what
have
you
been
doing
why
extra
only
some
sweeping
and
cleaning
out
the
sweeping
cleaning
i
thought
durgin
did
she
does
i
mean
she
did
but
she
could
come
she
broke
her
leg
fell
off
the
stepladder
where
she
was
three
days
ago
so
i
to
do
it
and
someway
everything
went
wrong
i
burned
me
and
i
cut
me
and
i
used
two
sodas
with
not
any
cream
of
tartar
and
i
should
think
i
did
know
anything
not
anything
and
down
went
billy
head
into
the
pillows
again
in
another
burst
of
sobs
with
gentle
yet
uncompromising
determination
bertram
gathered
his
wife
into
his
arms
and
carried
her
to
the
big
chair
there
for
a
few
minutes
he
soothed
and
petted
her
as
if
she
were
a
tired
child
which
indeed
she
was
billy
this
thing
has
got
to
stop
he
said
then
there
was
a
very
inexorable
ring
of
decision
in
his
voice
what
thing
this
housework
billy
sat
up
with
a
jerk
but
bertram
it
is
fair
you
ca
you
must
just
because
of
i
do
it
i
have
done
it
i
done
it
days
and
days
and
it
gone
beautifully
even
if
they
did
say
i
could
could
what
be
an
who
said
you
could
aunt
hannah
and
bertram
said
a
savage
word
under
his
breath
holy
smoke
billy
i
did
marry
you
for
a
cook
or
a
if
you
to
do
it
that
would
be
another
matter
of
course
and
if
we
did
have
to
do
it
we
would
have
a
big
house
like
this
for
you
to
do
it
in
but
i
did
marry
for
a
cook
and
i
knew
i
was
getting
one
when
i
married
billy
bridled
into
instant
wrath
well
i
like
that
bertram
henshaw
ca
i
cook
have
i
proved
that
i
can
cook
bertram
laughed
and
kissed
the
indignant
lips
till
they
quivered
into
an
unwilling
smile
bless
your
spunky
little
heart
of
course
you
have
but
that
mean
that
i
want
you
to
do
it
you
see
it
so
happens
that
you
can
do
other
things
too
and
i
rather
you
did
those
billy
you
played
to
me
for
a
week
nor
sung
to
me
for
a
month
you
too
tired
every
night
to
talk
or
read
together
or
go
anywhere
with
me
i
married
for
companionship
not
cooking
and
sweeping
billy
shook
her
head
stubbornly
her
mouth
settled
into
determined
lines
that
all
very
well
to
say
you
are
hungry
now
bertram
but
different
when
you
are
and
they
said
humph
are
aunt
hannah
and
kate
i
yes
and
the
to
young
wives
the
billy
choked
a
little
she
had
forgotten
that
bertram
did
not
know
about
the
talk
to
young
she
wished
that
she
had
not
mentioned
the
book
but
now
that
she
had
she
would
make
the
best
of
it
she
drew
herself
up
with
dignity
it
a
book
a
very
nice
book
it
says
lots
of
things
that
have
come
where
is
that
book
let
me
see
it
with
visible
reluctance
billy
got
down
from
her
perch
on
bertram
knee
went
to
her
desk
and
brought
back
the
book
bertram
regarded
it
frowningly
so
frowningly
that
billy
hastened
to
its
defense
and
it
true
what
it
says
in
there
and
what
aunt
hannah
and
kate
said
it
different
when
they
hungry
you
said
yourself
if
tend
to
my
husband
and
my
home
a
little
more
and
bertram
looked
up
with
unfeigned
amazement
i
said
what
he
demanded
in
a
voice
shaken
with
emotion
billy
repeated
the
fateful
words
i
never
when
did
i
say
that
the
night
uncle
william
and
i
came
home
from
for
a
moment
bertram
stared
dumbly
then
a
shamed
red
swept
to
his
forehead
billy
i
say
that
i
ought
to
be
shot
if
i
did
but
billy
you
said
you
forgiven
me
i
did
dear
truly
i
did
but
do
you
see
it
was
true
i
tended
to
things
so
i
been
doing
it
a
sudden
comprehension
illuminated
bertram
face
heavens
billy
and
is
that
why
you
have
been
anywhere
or
done
anything
is
that
why
calderwell
said
that
you
had
been
with
them
anywhere
and
that
great
scott
billy
did
you
think
i
was
such
a
selfish
brute
as
that
oh
but
when
i
was
going
with
them
i
following
the
book
i
thought
quavered
billy
and
hurriedly
she
turned
the
leaves
to
a
carefully
marked
passage
it
there
about
the
outside
interests
see
i
trying
to
brush
up
against
them
so
that
i
would
interfere
with
your
art
then
when
you
accused
me
of
gallivanting
off
with
but
bertram
swept
her
back
into
his
arms
and
not
for
some
minutes
could
billy
make
a
coherent
speech
again
then
bertram
spoke
see
here
billy
he
exploded
a
little
shakily
if
i
could
get
you
off
somewhere
on
a
desert
island
where
there
were
any
aunt
hannahs
or
kates
or
talks
to
young
wives
i
think
there
be
a
chance
to
make
you
happy
but
oh
but
there
was
truth
in
it
interrupted
billy
sitting
erect
again
i
know
how
to
run
a
house
and
it
was
perfectly
awful
while
we
were
having
all
those
dreadful
maids
one
after
the
other
and
no
woman
should
be
a
wife
who
does
know
all
right
all
right
dear
interrupted
bertram
in
his
turn
concede
that
point
if
you
like
but
you
know
now
you
got
the
efficient
housewife
racket
down
pat
even
to
the
last
calory
your
husband
should
be
fed
and
i
warrant
there
is
a
mary
ellen
in
christendom
who
can
find
a
spot
of
ignorance
on
you
as
big
as
a
pinhead
so
call
that
settled
what
you
need
now
is
a
good
rest
and
you
going
to
have
it
too
i
going
to
have
six
mary
ellens
here
morning
six
do
you
hear
and
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
get
your
gladdest
rags
together
for
a
trip
to
europe
with
me
next
month
because
we
going
i
shall
get
the
tickets
i
send
the
six
mary
ellens
packing
up
here
now
come
put
on
your
bonnet
we
going
down
town
to
chapter
xviii
billy
tries
her
hand
at
managing
bertram
did
not
engage
six
mary
ellens
the
next
morning
nor
even
one
as
it
happened
for
that
evening
eliza
who
had
not
been
unaware
of
conditions
at
the
strata
telephoned
to
say
that
her
mother
was
so
much
better
now
she
believed
she
could
be
spared
to
come
to
the
strata
for
several
hours
each
day
if
henshaw
would
like
to
have
her
begin
in
that
way
billy
agreed
promptly
and
declared
herself
as
more
than
willing
to
put
up
with
such
an
arrangement
bertram
it
is
true
when
he
heard
of
the
plan
rebelled
and
asserted
that
what
billy
needed
was
a
rest
an
entire
rest
from
care
and
labor
in
fact
what
he
wanted
her
to
do
he
said
was
to
gallivant
to
gallivant
all
day
long
nonsense
billy
had
laughed
coloring
to
the
tips
of
her
ears
besides
as
for
the
work
bertram
with
just
you
and
me
here
and
with
all
my
vast
experience
now
and
eliza
here
for
several
hours
every
day
it
be
nothing
but
play
for
this
little
time
before
we
go
away
see
all
right
i
then
bertram
had
nodded
meaningly
but
just
make
sure
that
it
play
for
you
i
will
laughed
billy
and
there
the
matter
had
ended
eliza
began
work
the
next
day
and
billy
did
indeed
soon
find
herself
playing
under
bertram
watchful
insistence
she
resumed
her
music
and
brought
out
of
exile
the
unfinished
song
with
bertram
she
took
drives
and
walks
and
every
two
or
three
days
she
went
to
see
aunt
hannah
and
marie
she
was
pleasantly
busy
too
with
plans
for
her
coming
trip
and
it
was
not
long
before
even
the
remorseful
bertram
had
to
admit
that
billy
was
looking
and
appearing
quite
like
her
old
self
at
the
annex
billy
found
calderwell
and
arkwright
one
day
they
greeted
her
as
if
she
had
just
returned
from
a
far
country
well
if
you
are
the
stranger
lady
began
calderwell
looking
frankly
pleased
to
see
her
we
thought
of
advertising
in
the
daily
press
somewhat
after
this
fashion
strayed
or
stolen
one
billy
comrade
good
friend
and
kind
of
lonely
hearts
any
information
thankfully
received
by
her
bereft
sorrowing
friends
billy
joined
in
the
laugh
that
greeted
this
sally
but
arkwright
noticed
that
she
tried
to
change
the
subject
from
her
own
affairs
to
a
discussion
of
the
new
song
on
alice
greggory
piano
calderwell
however
was
not
to
be
silenced
the
last
i
heard
of
this
elusive
billy
he
resumed
with
teasing
cheerfulness
she
was
running
down
a
certain
lost
calory
that
had
slipped
away
from
her
husband
breakfast
and
billy
wheeled
sharply
where
did
you
get
hold
of
that
she
demanded
oh
i
did
returned
the
man
defensively
i
never
got
hold
of
it
at
all
i
never
even
saw
the
calory
though
for
that
matter
i
think
i
should
know
one
if
i
did
see
it
what
we
feared
was
that
in
hunting
the
lost
calory
you
had
lost
yourself
and
but
billy
would
hear
no
more
with
her
disdainful
nose
in
the
air
she
walked
to
the
piano
come
arkwright
she
said
with
dignity
let
try
this
arkwright
rose
at
once
and
accompanied
her
to
the
piano
they
had
sung
the
song
through
twice
when
billy
became
uneasily
aware
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
calderwell
and
alice
greggory
were
softly
chuckling
over
something
they
had
found
in
a
magazine
billy
frowned
and
twitched
the
corners
of
a
pile
of
music
with
restless
fingers
i
wonder
if
alice
has
got
some
quartets
here
somewhere
she
murmured
her
disapproving
eyes
still
bent
on
the
absorbed
couple
across
the
room
arkwright
was
silent
billy
throwing
a
hurried
glance
into
his
face
thought
she
detected
a
somber
shadow
in
his
eyes
she
thought
too
she
knew
why
it
was
there
so
possessed
had
billy
been
during
the
early
winter
of
the
idea
that
her
special
mission
in
life
was
to
inaugurate
and
foster
a
love
affair
between
disappointed
arkwright
and
lonely
alice
greggory
that
now
she
forgot
for
a
moment
that
arkwright
himself
was
quite
unaware
of
her
efforts
she
thought
only
that
the
present
shadow
on
his
face
must
be
caused
by
the
same
thing
that
brought
worry
to
her
own
heart
the
manifest
devotion
of
calderwell
to
alice
greggory
just
now
across
the
room
instinctively
therefore
as
to
a
coworker
in
a
common
cause
she
turned
a
disturbed
face
to
the
man
at
her
side
it
is
indeed
high
time
that
i
looked
after
something
besides
lost
calories
she
said
significantly
then
at
the
evident
uncomprehension
in
arkwright
face
she
added
has
it
been
going
on
like
this
very
long
arkwright
still
apparently
did
not
understand
has
what
been
going
on
he
questioned
that
over
there
answered
billy
impatiently
scarcely
knowing
whether
to
be
more
irritated
at
the
threatened
miscarriage
of
her
cherished
plans
or
at
arkwright
to
her
wilfully
blind
insistence
on
her
making
her
meaning
more
plain
has
it
been
going
on
long
such
utter
devotion
as
she
asked
the
question
billy
turned
and
looked
squarely
into
arkwright
face
she
saw
therefore
the
great
change
that
came
to
it
as
her
meaning
became
clear
to
him
her
first
feeling
was
one
of
shocked
realization
that
arkwright
had
indeed
been
really
blind
her
second
she
turned
away
her
eyes
hurriedly
from
what
she
thought
she
saw
in
the
man
countenance
with
an
assumedly
gay
little
cry
she
sprang
to
her
feet
come
come
what
are
you
two
children
chuckling
over
she
demanded
crossing
the
room
abruptly
did
you
hear
me
say
i
wanted
you
to
come
and
sing
a
quartet
billy
blamed
herself
very
much
for
what
she
called
her
stupidity
in
so
baldly
summoning
arkwright
attention
to
calderwell
devotion
to
alice
greggory
she
declared
that
she
ought
to
have
known
better
and
she
asked
herself
if
this
were
the
way
she
was
furthering
matters
between
alice
greggory
and
arkwright
billy
was
really
seriously
disturbed
she
had
never
quite
forgiven
herself
for
being
so
blind
to
arkwright
feeling
for
herself
during
those
days
when
he
had
not
known
of
her
engagement
to
bertram
she
had
never
forgotten
either
the
painful
scene
when
he
had
hopefully
told
of
his
love
only
to
be
met
with
her
own
shocked
repudiation
for
long
weeks
after
that
his
face
had
haunted
her
she
had
wished
oh
so
ardently
that
she
could
do
something
in
some
way
to
bring
him
happiness
when
therefore
it
had
come
to
her
knowledge
afterward
that
he
was
frequently
with
his
old
friend
alice
greggory
she
had
been
so
glad
it
was
very
easy
then
to
fan
hope
into
conviction
that
here
in
this
old
friend
he
had
found
sweet
balm
for
his
wounded
heart
and
she
determined
at
once
to
do
all
that
she
could
do
to
help
so
very
glowing
indeed
was
her
eagerness
in
the
matter
that
it
looked
suspiciously
as
if
she
thought
could
she
but
bring
this
thing
about
that
old
scores
against
herself
would
be
erased
billy
told
herself
virtuously
however
that
not
only
for
arkwright
did
she
desire
this
marriage
to
take
place
but
for
alice
greggory
in
the
very
nature
of
things
alice
would
one
day
be
left
alone
she
was
poor
and
not
very
strong
she
sorely
needed
the
shielding
love
and
care
of
a
good
husband
what
more
natural
than
that
her
friend
and
arkwright
should
be
that
good
husband
that
really
it
was
more
arkwright
and
less
alice
that
was
being
considered
however
was
proved
when
the
devotion
of
calderwell
began
to
be
first
suspected
then
known
for
a
fact
billy
distress
at
this
turn
of
affairs
indicated
very
plainly
that
it
was
not
just
a
husband
but
a
certain
one
particular
husband
that
she
desired
for
alice
greggory
all
the
more
disturbed
was
she
therefore
when
seeing
her
three
friends
together
again
for
the
first
time
for
some
weeks
she
discovered
increased
evidence
that
her
worst
fears
were
to
be
realized
it
was
to
be
alice
and
calderwell
not
alice
and
arkwright
arkwright
was
again
to
be
disappointed
in
his
dearest
hopes
telling
herself
indignantly
that
it
could
not
be
it
not
be
billy
determined
to
remain
after
the
men
had
gone
and
speak
to
alice
just
what
she
would
say
she
did
not
know
even
what
she
could
say
she
was
not
sure
but
certainly
there
must
be
something
some
little
thing
that
she
could
say
which
would
open
alice
eyes
to
what
she
was
doing
and
what
she
ought
to
do
it
was
in
this
frame
of
mind
therefore
that
billy
after
arkwright
and
calderwell
had
gone
spoke
to
alice
she
began
warily
with
assumed
nonchalance
i
believe
arkwright
sings
better
every
time
i
hear
there
was
no
answer
alice
was
sorting
music
at
the
piano
do
you
think
so
billy
raised
her
voice
a
little
alice
turned
almost
with
a
start
what
that
oh
yes
well
i
do
know
maybe
i
you
would
if
you
did
hear
him
any
oftener
than
i
do
laughed
billy
but
then
of
course
you
do
hear
him
i
oh
no
indeed
not
so
very
much
alice
had
turned
back
to
her
music
there
was
a
slight
embarrassment
in
her
manner
i
wonder
where
that
new
song
is
she
murmured
billy
who
knew
very
well
where
the
song
lay
was
not
to
be
diverted
nonsense
as
if
arkwright
was
always
telling
how
alice
liked
this
song
and
did
like
that
one
and
thought
the
other
the
best
yet
i
do
believe
he
sings
a
thing
that
he
does
first
sing
to
you
for
that
matter
i
fancy
he
asks
your
opinion
of
everything
why
billy
he
does
exclaimed
alice
a
deep
red
flaming
into
her
cheeks
you
know
he
billy
laughed
gleefully
she
had
not
been
slow
to
note
the
color
in
her
friend
face
or
to
ascribe
to
it
the
one
meaning
she
wished
to
ascribe
to
it
so
sure
indeed
was
she
now
that
her
fears
had
been
groundless
that
she
flung
caution
to
the
winds
ho
my
dear
alice
you
ca
expect
us
all
to
be
blind
she
teased
besides
we
all
think
it
such
a
lovely
arrangement
that
we
just
glad
to
see
it
he
such
a
fine
fellow
and
we
like
him
so
much
we
could
ask
for
a
better
husband
for
you
than
arkwright
and
from
sheer
amazement
at
the
sudden
white
horror
in
alice
face
billy
stopped
short
why
alice
she
faltered
then
with
a
visible
effort
alice
forced
her
trembling
lips
to
speak
my
husband
arkwright
why
billy
you
could
have
seen
you
have
seen
there
nothing
you
see
he
is
he
was
he
ca
be
we
we
nothing
but
friends
billy
just
good
friends
billy
though
dismayed
was
still
not
quite
convinced
friends
nonsense
when
but
alice
interrupted
feverishly
alice
in
an
agony
of
fear
lest
the
true
state
of
affairs
should
be
suspected
was
hiding
behind
a
bulwark
of
pride
now
billy
please
say
no
more
you
quite
wrong
entirely
never
never
hear
of
my
marrying
arkwright
as
i
said
before
friends
the
best
of
friends
that
is
all
we
could
be
anything
else
possibly
billy
plainly
discomfited
fell
back
but
she
threw
a
sharp
glance
into
her
friend
flushed
countenance
you
mean
because
of
hugh
calderwell
she
demanded
then
for
the
second
time
that
afternoon
throwing
discretion
to
the
winds
she
went
on
plaintively
you
wo
listen
of
course
girls
in
love
never
do
hugh
is
all
right
and
i
like
him
but
there
more
real
solid
worth
in
arkwright
little
finger
than
there
is
in
hugh
whole
self
and
but
a
merry
peal
of
laughter
from
alice
greggory
interrupted
and
pray
do
you
think
i
in
love
with
hugh
calderwell
she
demanded
there
was
a
curious
note
of
something
very
like
relief
in
her
voice
well
i
did
know
began
billy
uncertainly
then
i
tell
you
now
smiled
alice
i
not
furthermore
perhaps
it
just
as
well
that
you
should
know
right
now
that
i
do
intend
to
marry
oh
alice
there
was
determination
and
there
was
still
that
curious
note
of
relief
in
the
girl
voice
it
was
as
if
somewhere
a
great
danger
had
been
avoided
i
have
my
music
that
is
enough
i
not
intending
to
oh
but
alice
while
i
will
own
up
i
glad
it
is
hugh
calderwell
there
arkwright
and
i
did
hope
but
alice
shook
her
head
and
turned
resolutely
away
at
that
moment
too
aunt
hannah
came
in
from
the
street
so
billy
could
say
no
more
aunt
hannah
dropped
herself
a
little
wearily
into
a
chair
i
just
come
from
marie
she
said
how
is
she
asked
billy
aunt
hannah
smiled
and
raised
her
eyebrows
well
just
now
she
quite
exercised
over
another
rattle
from
her
cousin
out
west
this
time
there
were
four
little
silver
bells
on
it
and
she
has
got
any
janitor
wife
now
to
give
it
billy
laughed
softly
but
aunt
hannah
had
more
to
say
you
know
she
is
going
to
allow
any
toys
but
teddy
bears
and
woolly
lambs
of
which
i
believe
she
has
already
bought
quite
an
assortment
she
says
they
do
rattle
or
squeak
i
declare
when
i
see
the
woolen
pads
and
rubber
hushers
that
that
child
has
put
everywhere
all
over
the
house
i
do
know
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
and
she
so
worried
it
seems
cyril
must
needs
take
just
this
time
to
start
composing
a
new
opera
or
symphony
or
something
and
never
before
has
she
allowed
him
to
be
interrupted
by
anything
on
such
an
occasion
but
what
he
do
when
the
baby
comes
she
says
she
does
know
for
she
says
she
ca
she
just
ca
keep
it
from
bothering
him
some
she
afraid
as
if
any
opera
or
symphony
that
ever
lived
was
of
more
consequence
than
a
own
child
finished
aunt
hannah
with
an
indignant
sniff
as
she
reached
for
her
shawl
chapter
xix
a
tough
nut
to
crack
for
cyril
it
was
early
in
the
forenoon
of
the
first
day
of
july
that
eliza
told
her
mistress
that
stetson
was
asking
for
her
at
the
telephone
eliza
face
was
not
a
little
troubled
i
afraid
maybe
it
is
good
news
she
stammered
as
her
mistress
hurriedly
arose
she
at
cyril
henshaw
stetson
is
and
she
seemed
so
terribly
upset
about
something
that
there
was
no
making
real
sense
out
of
what
she
said
but
she
asked
for
you
and
said
to
have
you
come
billy
her
own
face
paling
was
already
at
the
telephone
yes
aunt
hannah
what
is
it
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
billy
if
you
come
up
here
please
you
must
come
you
come
why
yes
of
course
but
but
the
the
a
faint
groan
came
across
the
wires
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
billy
it
is
baby
it
it
twins
boys
cyril
has
them
now
the
nurse
has
got
here
twins
has
them
broke
in
billy
hysterically
yes
and
they
crying
something
terrible
we
sent
for
a
second
nurse
to
come
too
of
course
but
she
has
got
here
yet
either
and
those
babies
if
you
could
hear
them
that
what
we
want
you
for
to
but
billy
was
almost
laughing
now
all
right
i
come
out
and
hear
them
she
called
a
bit
wildly
as
she
hung
up
the
receiver
some
little
time
later
a
palpably
nervous
maid
admitted
billy
to
the
home
of
and
cyril
henshaw
even
as
the
door
was
opened
billy
heard
faintly
but
unmistakably
the
moaning
wails
of
two
infants
mrs
stetson
says
if
you
will
please
to
help
henshaw
with
the
babies
stammered
the
maid
after
the
preliminary
questions
and
answers
i
been
in
when
i
could
and
they
all
right
only
they
crying
they
in
his
den
we
had
to
put
them
as
far
away
as
possible
their
crying
worried
henshaw
yes
i
see
murmured
billy
i
go
to
them
at
once
no
trouble
to
come
i
know
the
way
just
tell
stetson
i
here
please
she
finished
as
she
tossed
her
hat
and
gloves
on
to
the
hall
table
and
turned
to
go
upstairs
billy
feet
made
no
sound
on
the
soft
rugs
the
crying
however
grew
louder
and
louder
as
she
approached
the
den
softly
she
turned
the
knob
and
pushed
open
the
door
she
stopped
short
then
at
what
she
saw
cyril
had
not
heard
her
nor
seen
her
his
back
was
partly
toward
the
door
his
coat
was
off
and
his
hair
stood
fiercely
on
end
as
if
a
nervous
hand
had
ruffled
it
his
usually
pale
face
was
very
red
and
his
forehead
showed
great
drops
of
perspiration
he
was
on
his
feet
hovering
over
the
couch
at
each
end
of
which
lay
a
rumpled
roll
of
linen
lace
and
flannel
from
which
emerged
a
prodigiously
puckered
little
face
two
uncertainly
waving
fists
and
a
wail
of
protesting
rage
that
was
not
uncertain
in
the
least
in
one
hand
cyril
held
a
teddy
bear
in
the
other
his
watch
dangling
from
its
fob
chain
both
of
these
he
shook
feebly
one
after
the
other
above
the
tiny
faces
oh
come
come
pretty
baby
good
baby
hush
hush
he
begged
agitatedly
in
the
doorway
billy
clapped
her
hands
to
her
lips
and
stifled
a
laugh
billy
knew
of
course
that
what
she
should
do
was
to
go
forward
at
once
and
help
this
poor
distracted
man
but
billy
just
then
was
not
doing
what
she
knew
she
ought
to
do
with
a
muttered
ejaculation
which
billy
to
her
sorrow
could
not
catch
cyril
laid
down
the
watch
and
flung
the
teddy
bear
aside
then
in
very
evident
despair
he
gingerly
picked
up
one
of
the
rumpled
rolls
of
flannel
lace
and
linen
and
held
it
straight
out
before
him
after
a
moment
indecision
he
began
awkwardly
to
jounce
it
teeter
it
rock
it
back
and
forth
and
to
pat
it
jerkily
oh
come
come
pretty
baby
good
baby
hush
hush
he
begged
again
frantically
perhaps
it
was
the
change
of
position
perhaps
it
was
the
novelty
of
the
motion
perhaps
it
was
only
utter
weariness
or
lack
of
breath
whatever
the
cause
the
wailing
sobs
from
the
bundle
in
his
arms
dwindled
suddenly
to
a
gentle
whisper
then
ceased
altogether
with
a
ray
of
hope
illuminating
his
drawn
countenance
cyril
carefully
laid
the
baby
down
and
picked
up
the
other
almost
confidently
now
he
began
the
jouncing
and
teetering
and
rocking
as
before
there
there
oh
come
come
pretty
baby
good
baby
hush
hush
he
chanted
again
this
time
he
was
not
so
successful
perhaps
he
had
lost
his
skill
perhaps
it
was
merely
the
difference
in
babies
at
all
events
this
infant
did
not
care
for
jerks
and
jounces
and
showed
it
plainly
by
emitting
loud
and
yet
louder
wails
of
rage
wails
in
which
his
brother
on
the
couch
speedily
joined
oh
come
come
pretty
baby
good
baby
hush
hush
hush
i
say
exploded
the
frightened
weary
baffled
distracted
man
picking
up
the
other
baby
and
trying
to
hold
both
his
sons
at
once
billy
hurried
forward
then
tearfully
remorsefully
her
face
all
sympathy
her
arms
all
tenderness
here
cyril
let
me
help
you
she
cried
cyril
turned
abruptly
thank
god
one
come
he
groaned
holding
out
both
the
babies
with
an
exuberance
of
generosity
billy
you
saved
my
life
billy
laughed
tremulously
yes
i
come
cyril
and
i
help
every
bit
i
can
but
i
do
know
a
thing
not
a
single
thing
about
them
myself
dear
me
are
they
cunning
but
cyril
do
they
always
cry
so
the
drew
himself
stiffly
erect
cry
what
do
you
mean
why
should
they
cry
he
demanded
indignantly
i
want
you
to
understand
that
doctor
brown
said
those
were
a
number
i
fine
boys
anyhow
i
guess
there
no
doubt
they
got
lungs
all
right
he
added
with
a
grim
smile
as
he
pulled
out
his
handkerchief
and
drew
it
across
his
perspiring
brow
billy
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
show
cyril
how
much
or
how
little
she
knew
about
babies
for
in
another
minute
the
maid
had
appeared
with
the
extra
nurse
and
that
young
woman
with
trained
celerity
and
easy
confidence
assumed
instant
command
and
speedily
had
peace
and
order
restored
cyril
freed
from
responsibility
cast
longing
eyes
for
a
moment
upon
his
work
but
the
next
minute
with
a
despairing
glance
about
him
he
turned
and
fled
precipitately
billy
following
the
direction
of
his
eyes
suppressed
a
smile
on
the
top
of
cyril
manuscript
music
on
the
table
lay
a
bottle
draped
over
the
back
of
his
favorite
chair
was
a
baby
blanket
on
the
rested
a
beribboned
and
beruffled
toilet
basket
from
behind
the
sofa
pillow
leered
ridiculously
the
teddy
bear
just
as
it
had
left
cyril
desperate
hand
no
wonder
indeed
that
billy
smiled
billy
was
thinking
of
what
marie
had
said
not
a
week
before
i
shall
keep
the
baby
of
course
in
the
nursery
i
been
in
homes
where
they
had
baby
things
strewn
from
one
end
of
the
house
to
the
other
but
it
wo
be
that
way
here
in
the
first
place
i
believe
in
it
but
even
if
i
did
i
have
to
be
careful
on
account
of
cyril
imagine
cyril
trying
to
write
his
music
with
a
baby
in
the
room
no
i
shall
keep
the
baby
in
the
nursery
if
possible
but
wherever
it
is
it
wo
be
anywhere
near
cyril
den
billy
suppressed
many
a
smile
during
the
days
that
immediately
followed
the
coming
of
the
twins
some
of
the
smiles
however
refused
to
be
suppressed
they
became
indeed
shamelessly
audible
chuckles
billy
was
to
sail
the
tenth
and
naturally
during
those
early
july
days
her
time
was
pretty
much
occupied
with
her
preparations
for
departure
but
nothing
could
keep
her
from
frequent
though
short
visits
to
the
home
of
her
the
twins
were
proving
themselves
to
be
fine
healthy
boys
two
trained
maids
and
two
trained
nurses
ruled
the
household
with
a
rod
of
iron
as
to
cyril
billy
declared
that
cyril
was
learning
something
every
day
of
his
life
now
oh
yes
he
learning
things
she
said
to
aunt
hannah
one
morning
lots
of
things
for
instance
he
has
his
breakfast
now
not
when
he
wants
it
but
when
the
maid
wants
to
give
it
to
him
which
is
precisely
at
eight
every
morning
so
he
learning
punctuality
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
has
discovered
the
astounding
fact
that
there
are
several
things
more
important
in
the
world
than
is
the
special
piece
of
music
he
happens
to
be
composing
chiefly
the
twins
bath
the
twins
nap
the
twins
airing
and
the
twins
aunt
hannah
laughed
though
she
frowned
too
but
surely
billy
with
two
nurses
and
the
maids
cyril
does
have
to
to
she
came
to
a
helpless
pause
oh
no
laughed
billy
cyril
does
have
to
really
attend
to
any
of
those
things
though
i
have
seen
each
of
the
nurses
at
different
times
unhesitatingly
thrust
a
twin
into
his
arms
and
bid
him
hold
the
child
till
she
comes
back
but
it
this
way
you
see
marie
must
be
kept
quiet
and
the
nursery
is
very
near
her
room
it
worries
her
terribly
when
either
of
the
children
cries
besides
the
little
rascals
have
apparently
fixed
up
some
sort
of
compact
with
each
other
so
that
if
one
cries
for
something
or
nothing
the
other
promptly
joins
in
and
helps
so
the
nurses
have
got
into
the
habit
of
picking
up
the
first
disturber
of
the
peace
and
hurrying
him
to
quarters
remote
and
den
being
the
most
remote
of
all
they
usually
fetch
up
you
mean
they
take
those
babies
into
cyril
den
even
aunt
hannah
was
plainly
aghast
yes
twinkled
billy
i
fancy
their
hygienic
immaculacies
approved
of
cyril
bare
floors
undraped
windows
and
generally
condition
anyhow
they
made
his
den
a
sort
of
of
annex
to
the
but
but
cyril
what
does
he
say
stammered
the
dumfounded
aunt
hannah
think
of
cyril
standing
a
thing
like
that
does
he
do
anything
or
say
anything
billy
smiled
and
lifted
her
brows
quizzically
my
dear
aunt
hannah
did
you
ever
know
people
to
have
the
courage
to
things
to
one
of
those
becapped
beaproned
bespotless
creatures
of
loftily
superb
superiority
known
as
trained
nurses
besides
you
would
recognize
cyril
now
nobody
would
he
as
meek
as
moses
and
has
been
ever
since
his
two
young
sons
were
laid
in
his
reluctant
trembling
arms
he
breaks
into
a
cold
sweat
at
nothing
and
moves
about
his
own
home
as
if
he
were
a
stranger
and
an
interloper
endured
merely
on
sufferance
in
this
abode
of
strange
women
and
strange
nonsense
scoffed
aunt
hannah
but
it
so
maintained
billy
merrily
now
for
instance
you
know
cyril
always
has
been
in
the
habit
of
venting
his
moods
on
the
piano
just
as
i
do
only
more
so
by
playing
exactly
as
he
feels
well
as
near
as
i
can
gather
he
was
at
his
usual
trick
the
next
day
after
the
twins
arrived
and
you
can
imagine
about
what
sort
of
music
it
would
be
after
what
he
had
been
through
the
preceding
hours
of
course
i
do
know
exactly
what
happened
but
julia
marie
second
maid
you
know
tells
the
story
she
been
with
them
long
enough
to
know
something
of
the
way
the
whole
household
always
turns
on
the
pivot
of
the
master
whims
so
she
fully
appreciated
the
situation
she
says
she
heard
him
begin
to
play
and
that
she
never
heard
such
queer
creepy
shivery
music
in
her
life
but
that
he
had
been
playing
five
minutes
before
one
of
the
nurses
came
into
the
where
julia
was
dusting
and
told
her
to
tell
whoever
was
playing
to
stop
that
dreadful
noise
as
they
wanted
to
take
the
twins
in
there
for
their
nap
i
did
do
it
julia
says
lookin
for
my
place
an
i
let
the
young
woman
do
the
job
herself
an
she
done
it
pert
as
you
please
an
jest
as
i
was
seekin
a
for
the
explosion
if
henshaw
did
come
out
lookin
a
little
wild
but
as
meek
as
a
lamb
an
when
he
sees
me
he
asked
would
i
please
get
him
a
cup
of
coffee
good
an
strong
an
i
got
it
so
you
see
finished
billy
cyril
is
learning
things
lots
of
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
i
should
say
he
was
aunt
hannah
looking
meek
as
a
lamb
indeed
billy
laughed
merrily
well
it
must
be
a
new
experience
for
cyril
for
a
man
whose
daily
existence
for
years
has
been
and
and
whose
family
from
boyhood
has
stood
at
attention
and
saluted
if
he
so
much
as
looked
at
them
it
must
be
quite
a
change
as
things
are
now
however
it
be
different
of
course
when
marie
is
on
her
feet
does
she
know
at
all
how
things
are
going
not
very
much
as
yet
though
i
believe
she
has
begun
to
worry
some
she
confided
to
me
one
day
that
she
was
glad
of
course
that
she
had
two
darling
babies
instead
of
one
but
that
she
was
afraid
it
might
be
hard
just
at
first
to
teach
them
both
at
once
to
be
quiet
for
she
was
afraid
that
while
she
was
teaching
one
the
other
would
be
sure
to
cry
or
do
something
do
something
noisy
indeed
ejaculated
aunt
hannah
as
for
the
real
state
of
affairs
marie
does
dream
that
sacred
den
is
given
over
to
teddy
bears
and
baby
blankets
all
is
i
hope
she
be
measurably
strong
before
she
does
find
it
out

arkwright
eyes
are
opened
william
came
back
from
his
business
trip
the
eighth
of
july
and
on
the
ninth
billy
and
bertram
went
to
new
york
eliza
mother
was
so
well
now
that
eliza
had
taken
up
her
old
quarters
in
the
strata
and
the
household
affairs
were
once
more
running
like
clockwork
later
in
the
season
william
would
go
away
for
a
month
fishing
trip
and
the
house
would
be
closed
and
bertram
henshaw
were
not
expected
to
return
until
the
first
of
october
but
with
eliza
to
look
after
the
comfort
of
william
the
mistress
of
the
house
did
no
worrying
ever
since
pete
going
eliza
had
said
that
she
preferred
to
be
the
only
maid
with
a
charwoman
to
come
in
for
the
heavier
work
and
to
this
arrangement
her
mistress
had
willingly
consented
for
the
present
marie
and
the
babies
were
doing
finely
and
aunt
hannah
health
and
affairs
at
the
annex
were
all
that
could
be
desired
as
billy
indeed
saw
it
there
was
only
one
flaw
to
mar
her
perfect
content
on
this
holiday
trip
with
bertram
and
that
was
her
disappointment
over
the
very
evident
disaster
that
had
come
to
her
cherished
matrimonial
plans
for
arkwright
and
alice
greggory
she
could
not
forget
arkwright
face
that
day
at
the
annex
when
she
had
so
foolishly
called
his
attention
to
calderwell
devotion
and
she
could
not
forget
either
alice
greggory
very
obvious
perturbation
a
little
later
and
her
suspiciously
emphatic
assertion
that
she
had
no
intention
of
marrying
any
one
certainly
not
arkwright
as
billy
thought
of
all
this
now
she
could
not
but
admit
that
it
did
look
dark
for
arkwright
poor
arkwright
whom
she
more
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
perhaps
had
a
special
reason
for
wishing
to
see
happily
married
there
was
then
this
one
cloud
on
billy
horizon
as
the
big
boat
that
was
to
bear
her
across
the
water
steamed
down
the
harbor
that
beautiful
july
day
as
it
chanced
naturally
perhaps
not
only
was
billy
thinking
of
arkwright
that
morning
but
arkwright
was
thinking
of
billy
arkwright
had
thought
frequently
of
billy
during
the
last
few
days
particularly
since
that
afternoon
meeting
at
the
annex
when
the
four
had
renewed
their
old
good
times
together
up
to
that
day
arkwright
had
been
trying
not
to
think
of
billy
he
had
been
fighting
his
tiger
sternly
he
had
been
forcing
himself
to
meet
her
to
see
her
to
talk
with
her
to
sing
with
her
or
to
pass
her
by
all
with
the
indifference
properly
expected
to
be
shown
in
association
with
bertram
henshaw
another
man
wife
he
had
known
of
course
that
deep
down
in
his
heart
he
loved
her
always
had
loved
her
and
always
would
love
her
hopelessly
and
drearily
he
accepted
this
as
a
fact
even
while
with
all
his
might
fighting
that
tiger
skin
so
sure
was
he
indeed
of
this
so
implicitly
had
he
accepted
it
as
an
unalterable
certainty
that
in
time
even
his
efforts
to
fight
it
became
almost
mechanical
and
unconscious
in
their
stern
round
of
forced
indifference
then
came
that
day
at
the
annex
and
the
discovery
the
discovery
which
he
had
made
when
billy
called
his
attention
to
calderwell
and
alice
greggory
across
the
room
in
the
corner
the
discovery
which
had
come
with
so
blinding
a
force
and
which
even
now
he
was
tempted
to
question
as
to
its
reality
the
discovery
that
not
billy
neilson
nor
bertram
henshaw
nor
even
the
tender
ghost
of
a
lost
love
held
the
center
of
his
heart
but
alice
greggory
the
first
intimation
of
all
this
had
come
with
his
curious
feeling
of
unreasoning
hatred
and
blind
indignation
toward
calderwell
as
through
billy
eyes
he
had
seen
the
two
together
then
had
come
the
overwhelming
longing
to
pick
up
alice
greggory
and
run
off
with
her
somewhere
anywhere
so
that
calderwell
could
not
follow
at
once
however
he
had
pulled
himself
up
short
with
the
mental
cry
of
absurd
what
was
it
to
him
if
calderwell
did
care
for
alice
greggory
surely
he
himself
was
not
in
love
with
the
girl
he
was
in
love
with
billy
that
is
it
was
all
confusion
then
in
his
mind
and
he
was
glad
indeed
when
he
could
leave
the
house
he
wanted
to
be
alone
he
wanted
to
think
he
must
in
some
way
thrash
out
this
astounding
thing
that
had
come
to
him
arkwright
did
not
visit
the
annex
again
for
some
days
until
he
was
more
nearly
sure
of
himself
and
of
his
feelings
he
did
not
wish
to
see
alice
greggory
it
was
then
that
he
began
to
think
of
billy
deliberately
purposefully
for
it
must
be
of
course
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
he
told
himself
it
must
be
that
he
did
really
still
care
for
billy
though
of
course
he
ought
not
to
arkwright
made
another
discovery
then
he
learned
that
however
deliberately
he
started
in
to
think
of
billy
he
ended
every
time
in
thinking
of
alice
he
thought
of
how
good
she
had
been
to
him
and
of
how
faithful
she
had
been
in
helping
him
to
fight
his
love
for
billy
just
here
he
decided
for
a
moment
that
probably
after
all
his
feeling
of
anger
against
calderwell
was
merely
the
fear
of
losing
this
helpful
comradeship
that
he
so
needed
even
with
himself
however
arkwright
could
not
keep
up
this
farce
long
and
very
soon
he
admitted
miserably
that
it
was
not
the
comradeship
of
alice
greggory
that
he
wanted
or
needed
but
the
love
he
knew
it
now
no
longer
was
there
any
use
in
beating
about
the
bush
he
did
love
alice
greggory
but
so
curiously
and
unbelievably
stupid
had
he
been
that
he
had
not
found
it
out
until
now
and
now
it
was
too
late
had
not
even
billy
called
his
attention
to
the
fact
of
devotion
besides
had
not
he
himself
at
the
very
first
told
calderwell
that
he
might
have
a
clear
field
fool
that
he
had
been
to
let
another
thus
lightly
step
in
and
win
from
under
his
very
nose
what
might
have
been
his
if
he
had
but
known
his
own
mind
before
it
was
too
late
but
was
it
after
all
quite
too
late
he
and
alice
were
old
friends
away
back
in
their
young
days
in
their
native
town
they
had
been
indeed
almost
sweethearts
in
a
fashion
it
would
not
have
taken
much
in
those
days
he
believed
to
have
made
the
relationship
more
interesting
but
changes
had
come
alice
had
left
town
and
for
years
they
had
drifted
apart
then
had
come
billy
and
billy
had
found
alice
thus
bringing
about
the
odd
circumstance
of
their
renewing
of
acquaintanceship
perhaps
at
that
time
if
he
had
not
already
thought
he
cared
for
billy
there
would
have
been
something
more
than
acquaintanceship
but
he
thought
he
cared
for
billy
all
these
years
and
now
at
this
late
day
to
wake
up
and
find
that
he
cared
for
alice
a
pretty
mess
he
had
made
of
things
was
he
so
inconstant
then
so
fickle
did
he
not
know
his
own
mind
five
minutes
at
a
time
what
would
alice
greggory
think
even
if
he
found
the
courage
to
tell
her
what
could
she
think
what
could
anybody
think
arkwright
fairly
ground
his
teeth
in
impotent
wrath
and
he
did
not
know
whether
he
were
the
most
angry
that
he
did
not
love
billy
or
that
he
had
loved
billy
or
that
he
loved
somebody
else
now
it
was
while
he
was
in
this
unenviable
frame
of
mind
that
he
went
to
see
alice
not
that
he
had
planned
definitely
to
speak
to
her
of
his
discovery
nor
yet
that
he
had
planned
not
to
he
had
indeed
planned
nothing
for
a
man
usually
so
decided
as
to
purpose
and
energetic
as
to
action
he
was
in
a
most
unhappy
state
of
uncertainty
and
changeableness
one
thing
only
was
unmistakably
clear
to
him
and
that
was
that
he
must
see
alice
for
months
now
he
had
taken
to
alice
all
his
hopes
and
griefs
perplexities
and
problems
and
never
had
he
failed
to
find
comfort
in
the
shape
of
sympathetic
understanding
and
wise
counsel
to
alice
therefore
now
he
turned
as
a
matter
of
course
telling
himself
vaguely
that
perhaps
after
he
had
seen
alice
he
would
feel
better
just
how
intimately
this
particular
problem
of
his
concerned
alice
herself
he
did
not
stop
to
realize
he
did
not
indeed
think
of
it
at
all
from
alice
standpoint
until
he
came
face
to
face
with
the
girl
in
the
at
the
annex
then
suddenly
he
did
his
manner
became
at
once
consequently
full
of
embarrassment
and
quite
devoid
of
its
usual
frank
friendliness
as
it
happened
this
was
perhaps
the
most
unfortunate
thing
that
could
have
occurred
so
far
as
it
concerned
the
attitude
of
alice
greggory
for
thereby
innumerable
tiny
sparks
of
suspicion
that
had
been
tormenting
the
girl
for
days
were
instantly
fanned
into
consuming
flames
of
conviction
alice
had
not
been
slow
to
note
arkwright
prolonged
absence
from
the
annex
coming
as
it
did
so
soon
after
her
most
disconcerting
talk
with
billy
in
regard
to
her
own
relations
with
him
it
had
filled
her
with
frightened
questionings
if
billy
had
seen
things
to
make
her
think
of
linking
their
names
together
perhaps
arkwright
himself
had
heard
some
such
idea
put
forth
somewhere
and
that
was
why
he
was
staying
away
to
show
the
world
that
there
was
no
foundation
for
such
rumors
perhaps
he
was
even
doing
it
to
show
that
even
in
her
thoughts
alice
could
scarcely
bring
herself
to
finish
the
sentence
that
arkwright
should
ever
suspect
for
a
moment
that
she
cared
for
him
was
intolerable
painfully
conscious
as
she
was
that
she
did
care
for
him
it
was
easy
to
fear
that
others
must
be
conscious
of
it
too
had
she
not
already
proof
that
billy
suspected
it
why
then
might
not
it
be
quite
possible
even
probable
that
arkwright
suspected
it
also
and
because
he
did
suspect
it
had
decided
that
it
would
be
just
as
well
perhaps
if
he
did
not
call
so
often
in
spite
of
alice
angry
insistence
to
herself
that
after
all
this
could
not
be
the
case
that
the
man
she
understood
he
still
loved
billy
she
could
not
help
fearing
in
the
face
of
arkwright
unusual
absence
that
it
might
yet
be
true
when
therefore
he
finally
did
appear
only
to
become
at
once
obviously
embarrassed
in
her
presence
her
fears
instantly
became
convictions
it
was
true
then
the
man
did
believe
she
cared
for
him
and
he
had
been
trying
to
teach
her
to
save
her
to
teach
her
to
save
her
indeed
very
well
he
should
see
and
forthwith
from
that
moment
alice
greggory
chief
reason
for
living
became
to
prove
to
arkwright
that
he
needed
not
to
teach
her
to
save
her
nor
yet
to
sympathize
with
her
how
do
you
do
she
greeted
him
with
a
particularly
bright
smile
sure
i
you
are
well
such
a
beautiful
day
as
oh
yes
i
well
i
suppose
still
i
have
felt
better
in
my
life
smiled
arkwright
with
some
constraint
oh
i
sorry
murmured
the
girl
striving
so
hard
to
speak
with
impersonal
unconcern
that
she
did
not
notice
the
inaptness
of
her
reply
eh
sorry
i
felt
better
are
you
retorted
arkwright
with
nervous
humor
then
because
he
was
embarrassed
he
said
the
one
thing
he
had
meant
not
to
say
do
you
think
i
quite
a
stranger
it
been
some
time
since
i
been
alice
smarting
under
the
sting
of
what
she
judged
to
be
the
only
possible
cause
for
his
embarrassment
leaped
to
this
new
opportunity
to
show
her
lack
of
interest
oh
has
it
she
murmured
carelessly
well
i
do
know
but
it
has
now
that
i
come
to
think
of
arkwright
frowned
gloomily
a
week
ago
he
would
have
tossed
back
a
laughingly
aggrieved
remark
as
to
her
unflattering
indifference
to
his
presence
now
he
was
in
no
mood
for
such
joking
it
was
too
serious
a
matter
with
him
you
been
busy
no
doubt
with
other
matters
he
presumed
forlornly
thinking
of
calderwell
yes
i
have
been
busy
assented
the
girl
one
is
always
happier
i
think
to
be
busy
not
that
i
meant
that
i
needed
the
work
to
happy
she
added
hastily
in
a
panic
lest
he
think
she
had
a
consuming
sorrow
to
kill
no
of
course
not
he
murmured
abstractedly
rising
to
his
feet
and
crossing
the
room
to
the
piano
then
with
an
elaborate
air
of
trying
to
appear
very
natural
he
asked
jovially
anything
new
to
play
to
me
alice
arose
at
once
yes
i
have
a
little
nocturne
that
i
was
playing
to
calderwell
last
oh
to
calderwell
arkwright
had
stiffened
perceptibly
yes
did
like
it
i
play
it
to
you
and
see
what
you
say
she
smiled
seating
herself
at
the
piano
well
if
he
had
liked
it
it
safe
to
say
i
should
shrugged
arkwright
nonsense
laughed
the
girl
beginning
to
appear
more
like
her
natural
self
i
should
think
you
were
cyril
henshaw
calderwell
partial
to
ragtime
i
admit
but
there
are
some
good
things
he
there
are
indeed
good
things
he
likes
returned
arkwright
with
grim
emphasis
his
somber
eyes
fixed
on
what
he
believed
to
be
the
one
especial
object
of
calderwell
affections
at
the
moment
alice
unaware
both
of
the
melancholy
gaze
bent
upon
herself
and
of
the
cause
thereof
laughed
again
merrily
poor
calderwell
she
cried
as
she
let
her
fingers
slide
into
soft
introductory
chords
he
is
to
blame
for
not
liking
what
he
calls
our
lost
spirits
that
wail
it
just
the
way
he
arkwright
vouchsafed
no
reply
with
an
abrupt
gesture
he
turned
and
began
to
pace
the
room
moodily
at
the
piano
alice
slipped
from
the
chords
into
the
nocturne
she
played
it
straight
through
then
with
a
charm
and
skill
that
brought
arkwright
feet
to
a
pause
before
it
was
half
finished
by
george
that
great
he
breathed
when
the
last
tone
had
quivered
into
silence
yes
is
it
beautiful
she
murmured
the
room
was
very
quiet
and
in
the
last
rays
of
a
late
june
sunset
had
been
filling
the
room
with
golden
light
but
it
was
gone
now
even
at
the
piano
by
the
window
alice
had
barely
been
able
to
see
clearly
enough
to
read
the
notes
of
her
nocturne
to
arkwright
the
air
still
trembled
with
the
exquisite
melody
that
had
but
just
left
her
fingers
a
quick
fire
came
to
his
eyes
he
forgot
everything
but
that
it
was
alice
there
in
the
by
the
window
alice
whom
he
loved
with
a
low
cry
he
took
a
swift
step
toward
her
alice
instantly
the
girl
was
on
her
feet
but
it
was
not
toward
him
that
she
turned
it
was
away
resolutely
and
with
a
haste
that
was
strangely
like
terror
alice
too
had
forgotten
for
just
a
moment
she
had
let
herself
drift
into
a
dream
world
where
there
was
nothing
but
the
music
she
was
playing
and
the
man
she
loved
then
the
music
had
stopped
and
the
man
had
spoken
her
name
alice
remembered
then
she
remembered
billy
whom
this
man
loved
she
remembered
the
long
days
just
passed
when
this
man
had
stayed
away
presumably
to
teach
to
save
and
now
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
speaking
her
name
she
had
almost
bared
her
heart
to
him
no
wonder
that
alice
with
a
haste
that
looked
like
terror
crossed
the
floor
and
flooded
the
room
with
light
dear
me
she
shivered
carefully
avoiding
arkwright
eyes
if
calderwell
were
here
now
he
have
some
excuse
to
talk
about
our
lost
spirits
that
wail
that
a
creepy
piece
of
music
when
you
play
it
in
the
dark
and
for
fear
that
he
should
suspect
how
her
heart
was
aching
she
gave
a
particularly
brilliant
and
joyous
smile
once
again
at
the
mention
of
calderwell
name
arkwright
stiffened
perceptibly
the
fire
left
his
eyes
for
a
moment
he
did
not
speak
then
gravely
he
said
calderwell
yes
perhaps
he
would
and
you
ought
to
be
a
judge
i
should
think
you
see
him
quite
frequently
do
you
why
yes
of
course
he
often
comes
out
here
you
yes
i
had
heard
that
he
did
since
his
meaning
was
unmistakable
alice
looked
up
quickly
a
prompt
denial
of
his
implication
was
on
her
lips
when
the
thought
came
to
her
that
perhaps
just
here
lay
a
sure
way
to
prove
to
this
man
before
her
that
there
was
indeed
no
need
for
him
to
teach
her
to
save
her
or
yet
to
sympathize
with
her
she
could
not
affirm
of
course
but
she
need
not
deny
yet
nonsense
she
laughed
lightly
pleased
that
she
could
feel
what
she
hoped
would
pass
for
a
telltale
color
burning
her
cheeks
come
let
us
try
some
duets
she
proposed
leading
the
way
to
the
piano
and
arkwright
interpreting
the
apparently
embarrassed
change
of
subject
exactly
as
she
had
hoped
that
he
would
interpret
it
followed
her
sick
at
heart
wert
thou
in
the
cauld
blast
sang
arkwright
lips
a
few
moments
later
i
ca
tell
her
now
when
i
she
cares
for
calderwell
gloomily
ran
his
thoughts
the
while
it
would
do
no
possible
good
and
would
only
make
her
unhappy
to
grieve
wert
thou
in
the
cauld
blast
chimed
in
alice
alto
low
and
sweet
i
reckon
now
he
wo
be
staying
away
from
here
any
more
just
to
me
ran
alice
thoughts
palpitatingly
triumphant
chapter
xxi
billy
takes
her
turn
at
questioning
arkwright
did
not
call
to
see
alice
greggory
for
some
days
he
did
not
want
to
see
alice
now
he
told
himself
wearily
that
she
could
not
help
him
fight
this
tiger
skin
that
lay
across
his
path
the
very
fact
of
her
presence
by
his
side
would
indeed
incapacitate
himself
for
fighting
so
he
deliberately
stayed
away
from
the
annex
until
the
day
before
he
sailed
for
germany
then
he
went
out
to
say
chagrined
as
he
was
at
what
he
termed
his
imbecile
stupidity
in
not
knowing
his
own
heart
all
these
past
months
and
convinced
as
he
also
was
that
alice
and
calderwell
cared
for
each
other
he
could
see
no
way
for
him
but
to
play
the
part
of
a
man
of
kindliness
and
honor
leaving
a
clear
field
for
his
preferred
rival
and
bringing
no
shadow
of
regret
to
mar
the
happiness
of
the
girl
he
loved
as
for
being
his
old
easy
frank
self
on
this
last
call
however
that
was
impossible
so
alice
found
plenty
of
fuel
for
her
still
burning
fires
of
suspicion
fires
which
had
indeed
blazed
up
anew
at
this
second
long
period
of
absence
on
the
part
of
arkwright
naturally
therefore
the
call
was
anything
but
a
joy
and
comfort
to
either
one
arkwright
was
nervous
gloomy
and
abnormally
gay
by
turns
alice
was
nervous
and
abnormally
gay
all
the
time
then
they
said
and
arkwright
went
away
he
sailed
the
next
day
and
alice
settled
down
to
the
summer
of
study
and
hard
work
she
had
laid
out
for
herself
on
the
tenth
of
september
billy
came
home
she
was
brown
and
smiling
she
declared
that
she
had
had
a
perfectly
beautiful
time
and
that
there
could
be
anything
in
the
world
nicer
than
the
trip
she
and
bertram
had
taken
just
they
two
together
in
answer
to
aunt
hannah
solicitous
inquiries
she
asserted
that
she
was
all
well
and
rested
now
but
there
was
a
vaguely
troubled
questioning
in
her
eyes
that
aunt
hannah
did
not
quite
like
aunt
hannah
however
said
nothing
even
to
billy
herself
about
this
one
of
the
first
friends
billy
saw
after
her
return
was
hugh
calderwell
as
it
happened
bertram
was
out
when
he
came
so
billy
had
the
first
of
the
call
to
herself
she
was
not
sorry
for
this
as
it
gave
her
a
chance
to
question
calderwell
a
little
concerning
alice
greggory
something
she
had
long
ago
determined
to
do
at
the
first
opportunity
now
tell
me
everything
everything
about
everybody
she
began
diplomatically
settling
herself
comfortably
for
a
good
visit
thank
you
i
well
and
have
had
a
passably
agreeable
summer
barring
the
heat
sundry
persistent
mosquitoes
several
grievous
disappointments
and
a
felon
on
my
thumb
he
began
with
shameless
imperturbability
i
have
been
to
revere
once
to
the
circus
once
to
nantasket
three
times
and
to
keith
and
the
ten
times
perhaps
to
be
accurate
i
have
also
but
perhaps
there
was
some
one
else
you
desired
to
inquire
for
he
broke
off
turning
upon
his
hostess
a
bland
but
unsmiling
countenance
oh
no
how
could
there
be
twinkled
billy
really
hugh
i
always
knew
you
had
a
pretty
good
opinion
of
yourself
but
i
did
credit
you
with
thinking
you
were
go
on
i
so
interested
hugh
chuckled
softly
but
there
was
a
plaintive
tone
in
his
voice
as
he
answered
thanks
no
i
rather
lost
my
interest
now
lack
of
appreciation
always
did
discourage
me
we
talk
of
something
else
please
you
enjoyed
your
trip
very
much
it
just
could
have
been
nicer
you
were
lucky
the
heat
here
has
been
something
fierce
what
made
you
stay
reasons
too
numerous
and
one
too
to
mention
besides
you
forget
with
dignity
there
is
my
profession
i
have
joined
the
workers
of
the
world
now
you
oh
fudge
hugh
laughed
billy
you
know
very
well
you
as
likely
as
not
to
start
for
the
ends
of
the
earth
morning
hugh
drew
himself
up
i
do
seem
to
succeed
in
making
people
understand
that
i
serious
he
began
aggrievedly
i
with
an
expressive
flourish
of
his
hands
he
relaxed
suddenly
and
fell
back
in
his
chair
a
slow
smile
came
to
his
lips
well
billy
i
give
up
you
hit
it
he
confessed
i
thought
seriously
of
starting
morning
for
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
hugh
well
i
have
even
this
call
was
to
be
a
if
i
oh
hugh
but
i
really
thought
in
spite
of
my
teasing
that
you
had
settled
down
this
yes
so
did
i
sighed
the
man
a
little
soberly
but
i
guess
no
use
billy
oh
i
coming
back
of
course
and
link
arms
again
with
their
worthy
highnesses
john
doe
and
richard
roe
but
just
now
i
got
a
restless
fit
on
me
i
want
to
see
the
wheels
go
of
course
if
i
had
my
bread
and
butter
and
cigars
to
earn
be
different
but
i
have
and
i
know
i
have
and
i
suspect
that
where
the
trouble
lies
if
it
was
for
those
natal
silver
spoons
of
mine
that
bertram
is
always
talking
about
things
might
be
different
but
the
spoons
are
there
and
always
have
been
and
i
know
they
all
ready
to
dish
out
mountains
to
climb
and
lakes
to
paddle
in
any
time
i
a
mind
to
say
the
word
so
i
just
say
the
word
that
and
you
said
it
now
yes
i
think
so
for
a
and
those
reasons
that
kept
you
here
all
summer
ventured
billy
they
are
in
er
commission
any
longer
billy
hesitated
regarding
her
companion
meditatively
then
with
the
feeling
that
she
had
followed
a
blind
alley
to
its
termination
she
retreated
and
made
a
fresh
start
well
you
have
yet
told
me
everything
about
everybody
you
know
she
hinted
smilingly
you
might
begin
that
i
mean
the
less
important
everybodies
of
course
now
that
i
heard
about
meaning
oh
aunt
hannah
and
the
greggorys
and
cyril
and
marie
and
the
twins
and
arkwright
and
all
the
but
you
had
letters
yes
i
had
letters
from
some
of
them
and
i
seen
most
of
them
since
i
came
back
it
just
that
i
wanted
to
know
viewpoint
of
what
happened
through
the
very
well
aunt
hannah
is
as
dear
as
ever
wears
just
as
many
shawls
and
still
keeps
her
clock
striking
twelve
when
it
eleven
greggory
is
just
as
sweet
as
ever
and
a
little
more
frail
i
fear
bless
her
heart
arkwright
is
still
abroad
as
i
presume
you
know
i
hear
he
is
doing
great
stunts
over
there
and
will
sing
in
berlin
and
paris
this
winter
i
thinking
of
going
across
from
panama
later
if
i
do
i
shall
look
him
up
and
cyril
are
as
well
as
could
be
expected
when
you
realize
that
they
have
yet
settled
on
a
pair
of
names
for
the
i
know
it
and
the
poor
little
things
three
months
old
too
i
think
it
a
shame
you
heard
the
reason
i
suppose
cyril
declares
that
naming
babies
is
one
of
the
most
serious
and
delicate
operations
in
the
world
and
that
for
his
part
he
thinks
people
ought
to
select
their
own
names
when
they
arrived
at
years
of
discretion
he
wants
to
wait
till
the
twins
are
eighteen
and
then
make
each
of
them
a
birthday
present
of
the
name
of
their
own
well
if
that
is
the
limit
laughed
calderwell
i
heard
some
such
thing
before
but
i
had
supposed
it
was
really
well
it
is
he
says
he
knows
more
tomboys
and
enormous
fat
women
named
and
and
sweet
little
ladies
staggering
along
under
a
sonorous
theodosia
or
jane
and
that
if
he
should
name
the
boys
and
after
schubert
and
mendelssohn
as
marie
wants
to
they
as
likely
as
not
turn
out
to
be
men
who
hated
the
sound
of
music
and
doted
on
stocks
and
dry
humph
grunted
calderwell
i
saw
cyril
last
week
and
he
said
he
had
named
the
twins
yet
but
he
did
tell
me
why
i
offered
him
two
perfectly
good
names
myself
but
he
did
seem
what
were
they
eldad
and
hugh
protested
billy
well
why
not
bridled
the
man
i
sure
those
are
new
and
unique
and
really
musical
too
ahead
of
your
franz
and
but
those
are
really
names
indeed
they
where
did
you
get
them
off
our
family
tree
though
they
bible
names
belle
says
perhaps
you
did
know
but
sister
belle
has
been
making
the
dirt
fly
quite
lively
of
late
around
that
family
tree
of
ours
and
she
wrote
me
some
of
her
discoveries
it
seems
two
of
the
roots
or
branches
say
are
ancestors
roots
or
branches
were
called
eldad
and
bildad
now
i
thought
those
names
were
good
enough
to
pass
along
but
as
i
said
before
cyril
was
i
should
say
not
laughed
billy
but
honestly
hugh
it
really
serious
marie
wants
them
named
but
she
does
say
much
to
cyril
marie
would
really
breathe
you
know
if
she
thought
cyril
disapproved
of
breathing
and
in
this
case
cyril
does
not
hesitate
to
declare
that
the
boys
shall
name
what
a
situation
laughed
calderwell
is
it
but
do
you
know
i
can
sympathize
with
it
in
a
way
for
i
always
mourned
so
over
name
was
always
such
a
trial
to
me
poor
uncle
william
was
the
only
one
that
prepared
guns
and
fishing
rods
to
entertain
the
expected
boy
i
do
know
though
afraid
if
i
been
allowed
to
select
my
name
i
should
have
been
a
clarabella
all
my
days
for
that
was
the
name
i
gave
all
my
dolls
with
and
so
on
added
to
them
for
distinction
evidently
i
thought
that
clarabella
was
the
most
feminine
appellation
possible
and
the
most
foreign
to
the
despised
so
you
see
i
can
sympathize
with
cyril
to
a
certain
but
they
must
call
the
little
chaps
now
argued
hugh
billy
gave
a
sudden
merry
laugh
they
do
she
gurgled
and
that
the
funniest
part
of
it
oh
cyril
does
he
always
calls
them
impersonally
or
he
see
much
of
them
anyway
now
i
understand
marie
was
horrified
when
she
realized
how
the
nurses
had
been
using
his
den
as
a
nursery
annex
and
she
changed
all
that
instanter
when
she
took
charge
of
things
again
the
twins
stay
in
the
nursery
now
i
told
but
about
the
names
the
nurses
it
seems
have
got
into
the
way
of
calling
them
and
one
has
a
dimple
in
his
cheek
and
the
other
is
a
little
smaller
of
the
two
marie
is
no
end
distressed
particularly
as
she
finds
that
she
herself
calls
them
that
and
she
says
the
idea
of
boys
being
and
i
should
say
so
laughed
calderwell
not
i
regard
that
as
worse
than
my
and
i
know
it
and
alice
says
by
the
way
you
have
mentioned
alice
but
i
suppose
you
see
her
billy
paused
in
evident
expectation
of
a
reply
billy
was
in
fact
quite
pluming
herself
on
the
adroit
casualness
with
which
she
had
introduced
the
subject
nearest
her
heart
calderwell
raised
his
eyebrows
oh
yes
i
see
but
you
had
mentioned
there
was
the
briefest
of
pauses
then
with
a
dejection
there
came
the
remark
you
seem
to
forget
i
told
you
that
i
stayed
here
this
summer
for
reasons
too
numerous
and
one
too
to
mention
she
was
the
you
mean
yes
the
usual
thing
she
turned
me
down
oh
i
have
asked
her
yet
as
many
times
as
i
did
you
but
hugh
tossed
her
a
grim
smile
and
went
on
imperturbably
i
older
now
of
course
and
know
more
perhaps
besides
the
finality
of
her
remarks
was
not
to
be
billy
in
spite
of
her
sympathy
for
calderwell
was
conscious
of
a
throb
of
relief
that
at
least
one
was
removed
from
possible
pathway
to
alice
heart
did
she
give
any
special
reason
hazarded
billy
a
shade
too
anxiously
oh
yes
she
said
she
was
going
to
marry
anybody
only
her
nonsense
ejaculated
billy
falling
back
in
her
chair
a
little
yes
i
said
that
too
gloomed
the
man
but
it
did
do
any
good
you
see
i
had
known
another
girl
who
said
the
same
thing
he
did
not
look
up
but
a
vivid
red
flamed
suddenly
into
billy
cheeks
and
she
when
the
right
one
came
forgot
all
about
the
music
and
married
the
man
so
i
naturally
suspected
that
alice
would
do
the
same
thing
in
fact
i
said
so
to
her
i
was
bold
enough
to
even
call
the
man
by
name
i
had
been
jealous
of
arkwright
for
nothing
you
see
but
she
denied
it
and
flew
into
such
an
indignant
allegation
that
there
was
a
word
of
truth
in
it
that
i
had
to
sue
for
pardon
before
i
got
anything
like
said
billy
in
a
disappointed
voice
falling
quite
back
in
her
chair
this
time
and
so
that
why
i
wanting
especially
just
now
to
see
the
wheels
go
smiled
calderwell
a
little
wistfully
oh
i
shall
get
over
it
i
suppose
it
is
the
first
time
i
own
but
some
day
i
take
it
there
will
be
a
last
time
enough
of
this
however
you
have
told
me
a
thing
about
yourself
how
about
it
when
i
come
back
are
you
going
to
give
me
a
dinner
cooked
by
your
own
fair
hands
going
to
still
play
bridget
billy
laughed
and
shook
her
head
no
far
from
it
eliza
has
come
back
and
her
cousin
from
vermont
is
coming
as
second
girl
to
help
her
but
i
cook
a
dinner
for
you
if
i
had
to
now
sir
and
it
would
be
and
cold
lamb
she
bragged
shamelessly
as
there
sounded
bertram
peculiar
ring
and
the
click
of
his
key
in
the
lock
it
was
the
next
afternoon
that
billy
called
on
marie
from
marie
billy
went
to
the
annex
which
was
very
near
cyril
new
house
and
there
in
aunt
hannah
room
she
had
what
she
told
bertram
afterwards
was
a
perfectly
lovely
visit
aunt
hannah
too
enjoyed
the
visit
very
much
though
yet
there
was
one
thing
that
disturbed
her
the
vaguely
troubled
look
in
billy
eyes
which
was
more
apparent
than
ever
not
until
just
before
billy
went
home
did
something
occur
to
give
aunt
hannah
a
possible
clue
as
to
what
was
the
meaning
of
it
that
something
was
a
question
from
billy
aunt
hannah
why
do
i
feel
like
marie
did
why
do
i
feel
like
everybody
does
in
books
and
stories
marie
went
around
with
such
a
detached
heavenly
absorbed
look
in
her
eyes
before
the
twins
came
to
her
home
but
i
do
i
do
find
anything
like
that
in
my
face
when
i
look
in
the
glass
and
i
do
feel
detached
and
absorbed
and
heavenly
i
happy
of
course
but
i
ca
help
thinking
of
the
dear
dear
times
bertram
and
i
have
together
just
we
two
and
i
ca
seem
to
imagine
it
at
all
with
a
third
person
billy
indeed
there
i
knew
shock
you
mourned
billy
it
shocks
me
i
to
feel
detached
and
heavenly
and
but
billy
dear
think
of
it
calling
your
own
baby
a
third
person
billy
sighed
despairingly
yes
i
know
and
i
suppose
i
might
as
well
own
up
to
the
rest
of
it
too
i
i
actually
afraid
of
babies
aunt
hannah
well
i
am
she
reiterated
in
answer
to
aunt
hannah
gasp
of
disapproval
i
not
used
to
them
at
all
i
never
had
any
little
brothers
and
sisters
and
i
do
know
how
to
treat
babies
i
i
always
afraid
they
break
or
something
i
just
as
afraid
of
the
twins
as
i
can
be
how
marie
can
handle
them
and
toss
them
about
as
she
does
i
do
toss
them
about
indeed
well
it
looks
that
way
to
me
sighed
billy
anyhow
i
know
i
can
never
get
to
handle
them
like
that
and
that
no
way
to
feel
and
i
ashamed
of
myself
because
i
be
detached
and
heavenly
and
absorbed
she
added
rising
to
go
everybody
always
is
it
seems
but
just
fiddlededee
my
dear
scoffed
aunt
hannah
patting
billy
downcast
face
wait
till
a
year
from
now
and
we
see
about
that
bugaboo
you
worrying
about
not
worrying
now
so
you
better
not
chapter
xxii
a
dot
and
a
dimple
on
the
day
cyril
henshaw
twins
were
six
months
old
a
momentous
occurrence
marked
the
date
with
a
flaming
red
letter
of
remembrance
and
it
all
began
with
a
baby
smile
cyril
in
quest
of
his
wife
at
about
ten
that
morning
and
not
finding
her
pursued
his
search
even
to
the
nursery
a
room
he
very
seldom
entered
cyril
did
not
like
to
go
into
the
nursery
he
felt
ill
at
ease
and
as
if
he
were
away
from
home
and
cyril
was
known
to
abhor
being
away
from
home
since
he
was
married
now
that
marie
had
taken
over
the
reins
of
government
again
he
had
been
obliged
to
see
very
little
of
those
strange
women
and
babies
not
but
that
he
liked
the
babies
of
course
they
were
his
sons
and
he
was
proud
of
them
they
should
have
every
advantage
that
college
special
training
and
travel
could
give
them
he
quite
anticipated
what
they
would
be
to
him
when
they
really
knew
anything
but
of
course
when
they
could
do
nothing
but
cry
and
wave
their
absurd
little
fists
and
wobble
their
heads
in
so
fearsome
a
manner
as
if
they
simply
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
backbone
and
for
that
matter
of
course
they
did
why
he
could
not
be
expected
to
be
anything
but
relieved
when
he
had
his
den
to
himself
again
with
a
reasonable
chance
of
finding
his
manuscript
as
he
had
left
it
and
not
cut
up
into
a
ridiculous
string
of
paper
dolls
holding
hands
as
he
had
once
found
it
after
a
visit
from
a
woman
with
a
small
girl
since
marie
had
been
at
the
helm
however
he
had
not
been
troubled
in
such
a
way
he
had
indeed
known
almost
his
old
customary
peace
and
freedom
from
interruption
with
only
an
occasional
flitting
across
his
path
of
the
strange
women
and
babies
though
he
had
realized
of
course
that
they
were
in
the
house
especially
in
the
nursery
for
that
reason
therefore
he
always
avoided
the
nursery
when
possible
but
he
wanted
his
wife
and
his
wife
was
not
to
be
found
anywhere
else
in
the
house
so
reluctantly
he
turned
his
steps
toward
the
nursery
and
with
a
frown
knocked
and
pushed
open
the
door
is
henshaw
here
he
demanded
not
over
gently
absolute
silence
greeted
his
question
the
man
saw
then
that
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
save
a
baby
sitting
on
a
mat
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
barricaded
on
all
sides
with
pillows
with
a
deeper
frown
the
man
turned
to
go
when
a
gleeful
ah
goo
halted
his
steps
midway
he
wheeled
sharply
er
eh
he
queried
uncertainly
eyeing
his
small
son
on
the
floor
ah
goo
observed
the
infant
who
had
been
very
lonesome
with
greater
emphasis
and
this
time
he
sent
into
his
father
eyes
the
most
bewitching
of
smiles
well
by
george
murmured
the
man
weakly
a
dawning
amazement
driving
the
frown
from
his
face
spgggh
oo
wah
gurgled
the
boy
holding
out
two
tiny
fists
a
slow
smile
came
to
the
man
face
well
i
be
darned
he
muttered
wholly
delightedly
if
the
rascal
does
act
as
if
he
knew
me
ah
goo
spggghh
grinned
the
infant
toothlessly
but
entrancingly
with
almost
a
stealthy
touch
cyril
closed
the
door
back
of
him
and
advanced
a
little
dubiously
toward
his
son
his
countenance
carried
a
mixture
of
guilt
curiosity
and
dogged
determination
so
ludicrous
that
it
was
a
pity
none
but
baby
eyes
could
see
it
as
if
to
meet
more
nearly
on
a
level
this
baffling
new
acquaintance
cyril
got
to
his
knees
somewhat
stiffly
it
must
be
confessed
and
faced
his
son
goo
eee
ooo
yah
crowed
the
baby
now
thrashing
legs
and
arms
about
in
a
transport
of
joy
at
the
acquisition
of
this
new
playmate
well
well
young
man
you
you
do
say
so
stammered
the
father
thrusting
a
plainly
timid
and
unaccustomed
finger
toward
his
offspring
so
you
do
know
me
eh
well
who
am
i
da
da
gurgled
the
boy
triumphantly
clutching
the
outstretched
finger
and
holding
on
with
a
tenacity
that
brought
a
gleeful
chuckle
to
the
lips
of
the
man
jove
but
are
you
the
strong
little
beggar
though
need
tell
me
you
do
know
a
good
thing
when
you
see
it
so
i
am
i
he
went
on
unhesitatingly
accepting
as
the
pure
gold
of
knowledge
the
shameless
imitation
vocabulary
his
son
was
foisting
upon
him
well
i
expect
i
am
and
oh
cyril
the
door
had
opened
and
marie
was
in
the
room
if
she
gave
a
start
of
surprise
at
her
husband
unaccustomed
attitude
she
quickly
controlled
herself
julia
said
you
wanted
me
i
must
have
been
going
down
the
back
stairs
when
you
came
up
the
front
and
please
henshaw
is
it
dot
you
have
in
here
or
dimple
asked
a
new
voice
as
the
second
nurse
entered
by
another
door
before
henshaw
could
answer
cyril
who
had
got
to
his
feet
turned
sharply
is
it
he
demanded
oh
oh
henshaw
stammered
the
girl
i
beg
your
pardon
i
know
you
were
here
it
was
only
that
i
wanted
to
know
which
baby
it
was
we
thought
we
had
dot
with
us
until
dot
dimple
exploded
the
man
do
you
mean
to
say
you
have
given
my
the
ridiculous
names
of
and
why
no
yes
well
that
is
we
had
to
call
them
something
faltered
the
nurse
as
with
a
despairing
glance
at
her
mistress
she
plunged
through
the
doorway
cyril
turned
to
his
wife
marie
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
he
demanded
why
cyril
dear
do
do
get
so
wrought
up
she
begged
only
as
mary
said
we
to
call
them
something
and
wrought
up
indeed
interrupted
cyril
savagely
who
would
be
and
great
scott
one
would
think
those
boys
were
a
couple
of
kittens
or
puppies
that
they
did
know
anything
have
any
brains
but
they
have
if
the
other
is
anything
like
this
one
at
least
he
declared
pointing
to
his
son
on
the
floor
who
at
this
opportune
moment
joined
in
the
conversation
to
the
extent
of
an
appropriate
ah
goo
da
da
there
hear
that
will
you
triumphed
the
father
what
did
i
tell
you
that
the
way
he
been
going
on
ever
since
i
came
into
the
room
the
little
rascal
knows
me
so
soon
marie
clapped
her
fingers
to
her
lips
and
turned
her
back
suddenly
with
a
spasmodic
little
cough
but
her
husband
if
he
noticed
the
interruption
paid
no
heed
dot
and
dimple
indeed
he
went
on
wrathfully
that
settles
it
name
those
boys
marie
not
once
again
will
i
let
the
sun
go
down
on
a
dot
and
a
dimple
under
my
marie
turned
with
a
quick
little
cry
of
happiness
oh
cyril
i
so
glad
i
so
wanted
to
have
them
named
you
know
and
shall
we
call
them
franz
and
felix
as
we
talked
franz
felix
john
james
paul
charles
anything
so
it
sane
and
sensible
i
even
adopt
calderwell
absurd
bildad
and
er
tomdad
or
whatever
it
was
rather
than
have
those
poor
little
chaps
insulted
a
day
longer
with
a
and
a
great
scott
and
entirely
forgetting
what
he
had
come
to
the
nursery
for
cyril
strode
from
the
room
ah
goo
spggggh
commented
baby
from
the
middle
of
the
floor
it
was
on
a
very
windy
march
day
that
bertram
henshaw
son
bertram
arrived
at
the
strata
billy
went
so
far
into
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
for
her
baby
that
it
was
some
days
before
she
realized
in
all
its
importance
the
presence
of
the
new
member
of
her
family
even
when
the
days
had
become
weeks
and
bertram
was
a
month
and
a
half
old
the
extreme
lassitude
and
weariness
of
his
young
mother
was
a
source
of
anxiety
to
her
family
and
friends
billy
was
so
unlike
herself
they
all
said
if
something
could
only
rouse
her
suggested
the
henshaw
old
family
physician
one
day
a
certain
sort
of
mental
shock
if
not
too
severe
would
do
the
deed
i
think
and
with
no
injury
only
benefit
her
physical
condition
is
in
just
the
state
that
needs
a
stimulus
to
stir
it
into
new
life
and
as
it
happened
this
was
said
on
a
certain
monday
two
days
later
bertram
sister
kate
on
her
way
with
her
husband
to
hartwell
old
home
in
vermont
stopped
over
in
boston
for
a
two
days
visit
she
made
her
headquarters
at
cyril
home
but
very
naturally
she
went
without
much
delay
to
pay
her
respects
to
bertram
mr
hartwell
brother
is
well
she
explained
to
billy
after
the
greetings
were
over
you
know
he
the
only
one
left
there
since
mother
and
father
hartwell
came
west
we
shall
go
right
on
up
to
vermont
in
a
couple
of
days
but
we
just
had
to
stay
over
long
enough
to
see
the
baby
and
we
had
ever
seen
the
twins
either
you
know
by
the
way
how
perfectly
ridiculous
cyril
is
over
those
boys
is
he
smiled
billy
faintly
yes
one
would
think
there
were
never
any
babies
born
before
to
hear
him
talk
he
thinks
they
the
most
wonderful
things
in
the
world
and
they
are
cunning
little
fellows
i
admit
but
cyril
thinks
they
so
much
went
on
kate
laughingly
he
always
bragging
of
something
one
or
the
other
of
them
has
done
think
of
it
marie
says
it
all
started
from
the
time
last
january
when
he
discovered
the
nurses
had
been
calling
them
dot
and
yes
i
know
smiled
billy
again
faintly
lifting
a
thin
white
very
hand
to
her
head
kate
frowned
and
regarded
her
thoughtfully
mercy
how
you
look
billy
she
exclaimed
with
cheerful
tactlessness
they
said
you
did
but
i
declare
you
look
worse
than
i
billy
pale
face
reddened
perceptibly
nonsense
it
just
that
i
so
so
tired
she
insisted
i
shall
be
all
right
soon
how
did
you
leave
the
children
well
and
happy
little
kate
because
mother
was
going
away
kate
is
mistress
you
know
when
i
gone
and
she
takes
herself
very
mistress
a
little
thing
like
her
why
she
ca
be
more
than
ten
or
eleven
murmured
billy
she
is
she
was
ten
last
month
but
you
think
she
was
forty
the
airs
she
gives
herself
sometimes
oh
of
course
there
nora
and
the
cook
and
miss
winton
the
governess
there
to
really
manage
things
and
mother
hartwell
is
just
around
the
corner
but
little
kate
she
managing
so
she
billy
suppressed
a
smile
billy
was
thinking
that
little
kate
came
naturally
by
at
least
one
of
her
traits
really
that
child
is
impossible
sometimes
resumed
hartwell
with
a
sigh
you
know
the
absurd
things
she
was
always
saying
two
or
three
years
ago
when
we
came
on
to
cyril
yes
i
well
i
thought
she
would
get
over
it
but
she
does
she
worse
if
anything
and
sometimes
her
insight
or
intuition
or
whatever
you
may
call
it
is
positively
uncanny
i
never
know
what
she
going
to
remark
next
when
i
take
her
anywhere
but
it
safe
to
say
whatever
it
is
it
be
unexpected
and
embarrassing
to
somebody
and
is
that
the
baby
broke
off
hartwell
as
a
cooing
laugh
and
a
voice
came
from
the
next
room
yes
the
nurse
has
just
brought
him
in
i
think
said
billy
then
i
go
right
now
and
see
him
rejoined
kate
rising
to
her
feet
and
hurrying
into
the
next
room
left
alone
billy
lay
back
wearily
in
her
she
wondered
why
kate
always
tired
her
so
she
wished
she
had
had
on
her
blue
kimono
then
perhaps
kate
would
not
have
thought
she
looked
so
badly
blue
was
always
more
becoming
to
her
than
billy
turned
her
head
suddenly
from
the
next
room
had
come
decisive
voice
oh
no
i
do
think
he
looks
a
bit
like
his
father
that
little
snubby
nose
was
never
the
henshaw
billy
drew
in
her
breath
sharply
and
pulled
herself
half
erect
in
her
chair
from
the
next
room
came
kate
voice
again
after
a
low
murmur
from
the
nurse
oh
but
he
is
i
tell
you
he
is
one
bit
of
a
henshaw
baby
the
henshaw
babies
are
always
ones
they
have
more
hair
and
they
look
well
billy
gave
a
low
cry
and
struggled
to
her
feet
oh
no
spoke
up
kate
in
answer
to
another
indistinct
something
from
the
nurse
i
do
think
he
near
as
pretty
as
the
twins
of
course
the
twins
are
a
good
deal
older
but
they
have
such
a
look
and
they
did
have
from
the
very
first
i
saw
it
in
their
tiniest
baby
pictures
but
this
baby
baby
is
please
cut
in
a
tremulous
but
resolute
voice
and
hartwell
turned
to
confront
bertram
mother
manifestly
weak
and
trembling
but
no
less
manifestly
and
determined
why
billy
expostulated
hartwell
as
billy
stumbled
forward
and
snatched
the
child
into
her
arms
perhaps
he
does
look
like
the
henshaw
babies
perhaps
he
is
as
pretty
as
the
twins
perhaps
he
has
much
hair
and
does
have
a
snub
nose
he
my
baby
just
the
same
and
i
shall
not
stay
calmly
by
and
see
him
abused
besides
think
he
prettier
than
the
twins
ever
thought
of
being
and
he
got
all
the
hair
i
want
him
to
have
and
his
nose
is
just
exactly
what
a
baby
nose
ought
to
be
and
with
a
superb
gesture
billy
turned
and
bore
the
baby
away
chapter
xxiii
billy
and
the
enormous
responsibility
when
the
doctor
heard
from
the
nurse
of
hartwell
visit
and
what
had
come
of
it
he
only
gave
a
discreet
smile
as
befitted
himself
and
the
occasion
but
to
his
wife
privately
that
night
the
doctor
said
when
he
had
finished
telling
the
story
and
i
could
have
prescribed
a
better
pill
if
i
tried
hartwell
oh
harold
reproved
the
doctor
wife
mildly
but
the
doctor
only
chuckled
the
more
and
said
you
wait
and
if
billy
friends
were
worried
before
because
of
her
lassitude
and
lack
of
ambition
they
were
almost
as
worried
now
over
her
amazing
alertness
and
insistent
activity
day
by
day
almost
hour
by
hour
she
seemed
to
gain
in
strength
and
every
bit
she
acquired
she
promptly
tested
almost
to
the
breaking
point
so
plainly
eager
was
she
to
be
well
and
strong
and
always
from
morning
until
night
and
again
from
night
until
morning
the
pivot
of
her
existence
around
which
swung
all
thoughts
words
actions
and
plans
was
the
sturdy
little
atom
of
humanity
known
as
bertram
jr
even
aunt
hannah
remonstrated
with
her
at
last
but
billy
dear
she
exclaimed
one
would
almost
get
the
idea
that
you
thought
there
was
a
thing
in
the
world
but
that
baby
billy
laughed
well
do
you
know
sometimes
i
think
there
is
she
retorted
unblushingly
billy
protested
aunt
hannah
then
a
little
severely
she
demanded
and
who
was
it
that
just
last
september
was
calling
this
same
a
third
person
in
your
home
third
person
indeed
aunt
hannah
did
i
did
i
really
say
such
a
dreadful
thing
as
that
but
i
did
know
then
of
course
i
know
how
perfectly
wonderful
a
baby
is
especially
such
a
baby
as
bertram
is
why
aunt
hannah
that
little
thing
knows
a
whole
lot
already
he
known
me
for
weeks
i
know
he
has
and
ages
and
ages
ago
he
began
to
give
me
little
smiles
when
he
saw
me
they
were
smiles
real
smiles
oh
yes
i
know
nurse
said
they
were
smiles
at
the
first
admitted
billy
in
answer
to
aunt
hannah
doubting
expression
i
know
nurse
said
it
was
only
wind
on
his
stomach
think
of
it
wind
on
his
stomach
just
as
if
i
did
know
the
difference
between
my
own
smile
and
wind
on
his
stomach
and
you
do
know
how
soon
he
began
to
follow
my
moving
finger
with
his
eyes
yes
i
tried
that
one
day
i
remember
observed
aunt
hannah
demurely
i
moved
my
finger
he
looked
at
the
ceiling
well
probably
he
to
look
at
the
ceiling
then
defended
the
young
mother
promptly
i
sure
i
would
give
a
snap
for
a
baby
if
he
did
sometimes
have
a
mind
of
his
own
and
exercise
it
oh
billy
billy
laughed
aunt
hannah
with
a
shake
of
her
head
as
billy
turned
away
chin
uptilted
by
the
time
bertram
was
three
months
old
billy
was
unmistakably
her
old
happy
merry
self
strong
and
well
affairs
at
the
strata
once
more
were
moving
as
by
clockwork
only
this
time
it
was
a
baby
hand
that
set
the
clock
and
that
wound
it
too
billy
told
her
husband
very
earnestly
that
now
they
had
entered
upon
a
period
of
enormous
responsibility
the
life
character
and
destiny
of
a
human
soul
was
intrusted
to
their
care
and
they
must
be
wise
faithful
and
efficient
they
must
be
at
once
proud
and
humble
at
this
their
great
opportunity
they
must
observe
learn
and
practice
first
and
foremost
in
their
eyes
must
always
be
this
wonderful
important
trust
bertram
laughed
at
first
very
heartily
at
billy
instructions
which
he
declared
were
so
bristling
with
capitals
that
he
could
fairly
see
them
drop
from
her
lips
then
when
he
found
how
really
very
much
in
earnest
she
was
and
how
hurt
she
was
at
his
levity
he
managed
to
pull
his
face
into
something
like
sobriety
while
she
talked
to
him
though
he
did
persist
in
dropping
kisses
on
her
cheeks
her
chin
her
her
hair
and
the
little
pink
lobes
of
her
ears
just
by
way
of
punctuation
to
her
sentences
he
said
and
he
told
her
that
he
really
slighting
her
lips
only
that
they
moved
so
fast
he
could
not
catch
them
whereat
billy
pouted
and
told
him
severely
that
he
was
a
bad
naughty
boy
and
that
he
did
not
deserve
to
be
the
father
of
the
dearest
most
wonderful
baby
in
the
world
no
i
know
i
do
beamed
bertram
with
cheerful
unrepentance
but
i
am
just
the
same
he
finished
triumphantly
and
this
time
he
contrived
to
find
his
wife
lips
oh
bertram
sighed
billy
despairingly
you
an
old
dear
of
course
and
one
just
ca
be
cross
with
you
but
you
do
you
just
realize
your
immense
oh
yes
i
do
maintained
bertram
so
seriously
that
even
billy
herself
almost
believed
him
in
spite
of
his
assertions
however
it
must
be
confessed
that
bertram
was
much
more
inclined
to
regard
the
new
member
of
his
family
as
just
his
son
rather
than
as
an
important
trust
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
he
liked
to
toss
him
in
the
air
and
hear
his
gleeful
crows
of
delight
without
any
bother
of
observing
him
at
all
as
to
the
life
and
character
and
destiny
intrusted
to
his
care
it
is
to
be
feared
that
bertram
just
plain
gloried
in
his
son
poked
him
in
the
ribs
and
chuckled
him
under
the
chin
whenever
he
pleased
and
gave
never
so
much
as
a
thought
to
character
and
destiny
it
is
to
be
feared
too
that
he
was
proud
without
being
humble
and
that
the
only
opportunity
he
really
appreciated
was
the
chance
to
show
off
his
wife
and
baby
to
some
less
fortunate
but
not
so
billy
billy
joined
a
mothers
club
and
entered
a
class
in
child
training
with
an
elaborate
system
of
charts
rules
and
tests
she
subscribed
to
each
new
mothers
helper
and
the
like
that
she
came
across
devouring
each
and
every
one
with
an
eagerness
that
was
tempered
only
by
a
vague
uneasiness
at
finding
so
many
differences
of
opinion
among
those
who
knew
undeniably
billy
if
not
bertram
was
indeed
realizing
the
enormous
responsibility
and
was
keeping
ever
before
her
the
important
trust
in
june
bertram
took
a
cottage
at
the
south
shore
and
by
the
time
the
really
hot
weather
arrived
the
family
were
well
settled
it
was
only
an
hour
away
from
boston
and
easy
of
access
but
william
said
he
guessed
he
would
not
go
he
would
stay
in
boston
sleeping
at
the
house
and
getting
his
meals
at
the
club
until
the
middle
of
july
when
he
was
going
down
in
maine
for
his
usual
fishing
trip
which
he
had
planned
to
take
a
little
earlier
than
usual
this
year
but
you
be
so
lonesome
uncle
william
billy
demurred
in
this
great
house
all
alone
oh
no
i
rejoined
uncle
william
i
shall
only
be
sleeping
here
you
know
he
finished
with
a
slightly
peculiar
smile
it
was
well
perhaps
that
billy
did
not
exactly
realize
the
significance
of
that
smile
nor
the
unconscious
emphasis
on
the
word
sleeping
for
it
would
have
troubled
her
not
a
little
william
to
tell
the
truth
was
quite
anticipating
that
sleeping
william
nights
had
not
been
exactly
restful
since
the
baby
came
his
evenings
too
had
not
been
the
peaceful
things
they
were
wont
to
be
some
of
billy
rules
and
tests
were
strenuously
objected
to
on
the
part
of
her
small
son
and
the
young
man
did
not
hesitate
to
show
it
billy
said
that
it
was
good
for
the
baby
to
cry
that
it
developed
his
lungs
but
william
was
very
sure
that
it
was
not
good
for
certainly
when
the
baby
did
cry
william
never
could
help
hovering
near
the
center
of
disturbance
and
he
always
to
remind
billy
that
it
might
be
a
pin
you
know
or
some
cruel
thing
that
was
hurting
as
if
he
william
a
great
strong
man
could
sit
calmly
by
and
smoke
a
pipe
or
lie
in
his
comfortable
bed
and
sleep
while
that
blessed
little
baby
was
crying
his
heart
out
like
that
of
course
if
one
did
not
he
was
crying
hence
william
anticipation
of
those
quiet
restful
nights
when
he
could
not
know
it
very
soon
after
billy
arrival
at
the
cottage
aunt
hannah
and
alice
greggory
came
down
for
a
day
visit
aunt
hannah
had
been
away
from
boston
for
several
weeks
so
it
was
some
time
since
she
had
seen
the
baby
my
but
has
he
grown
she
exclaimed
picking
the
baby
up
and
stooping
to
give
him
a
snuggling
kiss
the
next
instant
she
almost
dropped
the
little
fellow
so
startling
had
been
billy
cry
no
no
wait
aunt
hannah
please
billy
was
entreating
hurrying
to
the
little
corner
cupboard
in
a
moment
she
was
back
with
a
small
bottle
and
a
bit
of
antiseptic
cotton
we
always
sterilize
our
lips
now
before
we
kiss
him
it
so
much
safer
you
aunt
hannah
sat
down
limply
the
baby
still
in
her
arms
fiddlededee
billy
what
an
absurd
idea
what
have
you
got
in
that
bottle
why
aunt
hannah
it
just
a
little
simple
listerine
bridled
billy
and
it
is
absurd
at
all
it
very
sensible
my
guide
for
mothers
says
well
i
suppose
i
may
kiss
his
hand
interposed
aunt
hannah
just
a
little
curtly
without
subjecting
myself
to
a
city
hospital
treatment
billy
laughed
shamefacedly
but
she
still
held
her
ground
no
you
ca
nor
even
his
foot
he
might
get
them
in
his
mouth
aunt
hannah
why
does
a
baby
think
that
everything
from
his
own
toes
to
his
father
watch
fob
and
the
plush
balls
on
a
caller
is
made
to
eat
as
if
i
could
sterilize
everything
and
keep
him
from
getting
hold
of
germs
somewhere
you
have
to
have
a
room
for
him
laughed
alice
greggory
playfully
snapping
her
fingers
at
the
baby
in
aunt
hannah
lap
billy
turned
eagerly
oh
did
you
read
about
that
too
she
cried
i
thought
it
was
interesting
and
i
wondered
if
i
could
do
alice
stared
frankly
you
do
mean
to
say
they
actually
such
things
she
challenged
well
i
read
about
them
in
a
magazine
asserted
billy
how
you
could
have
a
room
they
said
it
was
very
simple
too
just
pasteurize
the
air
you
know
by
heating
it
to
one
hundred
and
ten
and
degrees
fahrenheit
for
seventeen
and
minutes
i
remember
just
the
simple
indeed
it
sounds
so
scoffed
aunt
hannah
with
uplifted
eyebrows
oh
well
i
could
do
it
of
course
admitted
billy
regretfully
bertram
never
stand
for
that
in
the
world
he
always
rushing
in
to
show
the
baby
off
to
every
tom
dick
and
harry
and
his
wife
that
comes
and
of
course
if
you
opened
the
nursery
door
that
would
let
in
those
germ
things
and
you
very
well
pasteurize
your
callers
by
heating
them
to
one
hundred
and
ten
and
degrees
for
seventeen
and
minutes
i
do
see
how
you
could
manage
such
a
room
anyway
unless
you
had
a
system
of
of
rooms
like
locks
same
as
they
do
for
water
in
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
locks
indeed
almost
groaned
aunt
hannah
here
alice
will
you
please
take
this
child
that
is
if
you
have
a
certificate
about
you
to
show
to
his
mother
i
want
to
take
off
my
bonnet
and
take
him
of
course
i
take
him
laughed
alice
and
right
under
his
mother
nose
too
she
added
with
a
playful
grimace
at
billy
and
we
make
and
send
the
little
pigs
to
market
and
have
such
a
beautiful
time
that
we
forget
there
ever
was
such
a
thing
in
the
world
as
an
old
germ
eh
babykins
babykins
cooed
his
unqualified
approval
of
this
plan
but
his
mother
looked
troubled
that
all
right
alice
you
may
play
with
him
she
frowned
doubtfully
but
you
must
do
it
long
you
know
not
over
five
five
minutes
well
i
like
that
when
i
come
all
the
way
from
boston
purposely
to
see
him
pouted
alice
what
the
matter
now
time
for
his
nap
oh
no
not
for
thirteen
minutes
replied
billy
consulting
the
watch
at
her
belt
but
we
never
play
with
baby
more
than
five
minutes
at
a
time
my
care
of
infants
says
it
is
wise
that
with
some
babies
it
positively
dangerous
until
after
they
six
months
old
it
makes
them
nervous
and
forces
their
mind
you
know
she
explained
anxiously
so
of
course
we
want
to
be
careful
bertram
quite
four
why
yes
of
course
murmured
alice
politely
stopping
a
before
it
was
half
baked
the
infant
as
if
suspecting
that
he
was
being
deprived
of
his
lawful
baby
rights
began
to
fret
and
whimper
poor
itty
sing
crooned
aunt
hannah
who
having
divested
herself
of
bonnet
and
gloves
came
hurriedly
forward
with
outstretched
hands
do
they
just
come
here
to
your
old
auntie
sweetems
and
go
walkee
i
saw
a
such
a
tunnin
ickey
wickey
on
the
steps
when
i
came
in
come
we
go
see
ickey
wickey
aunt
hannah
protested
billy
both
hands
upraised
in
horror
you
say
and
leave
out
that
dreadful
wickey
of
course
he
ca
understand
things
now
really
but
we
never
know
when
he
begin
to
and
we
are
ever
going
to
let
him
hear
at
all
if
we
can
help
it
and
truly
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
it
is
absurd
to
expect
a
child
to
talk
sensibly
and
rationally
on
the
mental
diet
of
and
served
out
to
them
our
professor
of
metaphysics
and
ideology
in
our
child
study
course
says
that
nothing
is
so
receptive
and
plastic
as
the
mind
of
a
little
child
and
that
it
is
perfectly
appalling
how
we
fill
it
with
trivial
absurdities
that
even
the
virtue
of
being
accurate
so
that
why
we
trying
to
be
so
careful
with
baby
you
did
mind
my
speaking
i
know
aunt
oh
no
of
course
not
billy
retorted
aunt
hannah
a
little
tartly
and
with
a
touch
of
sarcasm
most
unlike
her
gentle
self
i
sure
i
should
wish
to
fill
this
infant
plastic
mind
with
anything
so
appalling
as
trivial
inaccuracies
may
i
be
pardoned
for
suggesting
however
she
went
on
as
the
baby
whimper
threatened
to
become
a
lusty
wail
that
this
young
gentleman
cries
as
if
he
were
sleepy
and
hungry
yes
he
is
admitted
billy
well
does
your
system
of
scientific
training
allow
him
to
be
given
such
trivial
absurdities
as
food
and
naps
inquired
the
lady
mildly
of
course
it
does
aunt
hannah
retorted
billy
laughing
in
spite
of
herself
and
it
almost
time
now
there
are
only
a
few
more
minutes
to
few
more
minutes
to
wait
indeed
scorned
aunt
hannah
i
suppose
the
poor
little
fellow
might
cry
and
cry
and
you
would
set
that
clock
ahead
by
a
teeny
weeny
minute
certainly
not
said
the
young
mother
decisively
my
guide
for
mothers
says
that
a
time
for
everything
and
everything
in
its
time
is
the
very
a
b
c
and
whole
alphabet
of
right
training
he
does
everything
by
the
clock
and
to
the
minute
declared
billy
proudly
aunt
hannah
sniffed
obviously
skeptical
and
rebellious
alice
greggory
laughed
aunt
hannah
looks
as
if
she
like
to
bring
down
her
clock
that
strikes
half
an
hour
ahead
she
said
mischievously
but
aunt
hannah
did
not
deign
to
answer
this
how
long
do
you
rock
him
she
demanded
of
billy
i
suppose
i
may
do
that
may
i
mercy
i
do
rock
him
at
all
aunt
hannah
exclaimed
billy
nor
sing
to
him
certainly
but
you
did
before
i
went
away
i
remember
that
you
yes
i
know
i
did
admitted
billy
and
i
had
an
awful
time
too
some
evenings
every
single
one
of
us
even
to
uncle
william
had
to
try
before
we
could
get
him
off
to
sleep
but
that
was
before
i
got
my
of
mother
and
child
or
my
training
and
oh
lots
of
others
you
see
i
did
know
a
thing
then
and
i
loved
to
rock
him
so
i
did
it
though
the
nurse
said
it
was
good
for
him
but
i
did
believe
i
had
an
awful
time
changing
but
i
done
it
i
just
put
him
in
his
little
crib
or
his
carriage
and
after
a
while
he
goes
to
sleep
sometimes
now
he
does
cry
hardly
any
i
afraid
though
he
will
she
worried
yes
i
afraid
he
will
almost
screamed
aunt
hannah
in
order
to
make
herself
heard
above
bertram
who
by
this
time
was
voicing
his
opinion
of
matters
and
things
in
no
uncertain
manner
it
was
not
after
all
so
very
long
before
peace
and
order
reigned
and
in
due
course
bertram
in
his
carriage
lay
fast
asleep
then
while
aunt
hannah
went
to
billy
room
for
a
short
rest
billy
and
alice
went
out
on
to
the
wide
veranda
which
faced
the
wonderful
expanse
of
sky
and
sea
now
tell
me
of
yourself
commanded
billy
almost
at
once
it
been
ages
since
i
heard
or
seen
a
thing
of
there
nothing
to
nonsense
but
there
must
be
insisted
billy
you
know
it
months
since
i
seen
anything
of
you
i
know
we
feel
quite
neglected
at
the
annex
said
alice
but
i
do
go
anywhere
defended
billy
i
ca
there
is
even
to
bring
us
the
extra
happiness
smiled
alice
a
quick
change
came
to
billy
face
her
eyes
glowed
deeply
no
though
i
had
so
much
that
ought
to
have
gone
such
loads
and
loads
of
extra
happiness
which
i
could
possibly
use
myself
sometimes
i
so
happy
alice
that
that
i
just
frightened
it
does
seem
as
if
anybody
ought
to
be
so
oh
billy
dear
demurred
alice
her
eyes
filling
suddenly
with
tears
well
i
got
the
annex
i
glad
i
got
that
for
the
overflow
anyway
resumed
billy
trying
to
steady
her
voice
i
sent
a
whole
lot
of
happiness
up
there
mentally
if
i
have
actually
carried
it
so
i
sure
you
must
have
got
it
now
tell
me
of
there
nothing
to
tell
insisted
alice
as
before
you
working
as
hard
as
ever
yes
new
pupils
yes
and
some
concert
engagements
good
ones
for
next
season
accompaniments
you
billy
nodded
yes
i
heard
of
you
already
twice
lately
in
that
line
and
very
flatteringly
have
you
well
that
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
abruptly
billy
changed
the
subject
i
had
a
letter
from
belle
calderwell
she
paused
expectantly
but
there
was
no
comment
you
do
seem
interested
she
frowned
after
a
minute
alice
laughed
pardon
me
but
i
do
know
the
lady
you
see
was
it
a
good
letter
you
know
her
very
alice
cheeks
showed
a
deeper
color
did
she
say
anything
of
him
yes
she
said
he
was
coming
back
to
boston
next
indeed
yes
she
says
that
this
time
he
declares
he
really
going
to
settle
down
to
work
murmured
billy
demurely
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
her
companion
she
says
he
engaged
to
be
married
one
of
her
friends
over
there
was
no
reply
alice
appeared
to
be
absorbed
in
watching
a
tiny
white
sail
far
out
at
sea
again
billy
was
silent
then
with
studied
carelessness
she
said
yes
and
you
know
arkwright
too
she
told
of
yes
well
what
of
him
alice
voice
was
studiedly
indifferent
oh
there
was
quite
a
lot
of
him
belle
had
just
been
to
hear
him
sing
and
then
her
brother
had
introduced
him
to
her
she
thinks
perfectly
wonderful
in
every
way
i
should
judge
in
fact
she
simply
raved
over
him
it
seems
that
while
we
been
hearing
nothing
from
him
all
winter
he
been
winning
no
end
of
laurels
for
himself
in
paris
and
berlin
he
been
studying
too
of
course
as
well
as
singing
and
now
he
got
a
chance
to
sing
somewhere
create
a
rôle
or
something
belle
said
she
was
quite
clear
on
the
matter
herself
but
it
was
a
perfectly
splendid
chance
and
one
that
was
a
fine
feather
in
his
then
he
wo
be
coming
home
that
is
to
boston
at
all
this
winter
probably
said
alice
with
a
cheerfulness
that
sounded
just
a
little
forced
not
until
february
but
he
is
coming
then
he
been
engaged
for
six
performances
with
the
boston
opera
company
as
a
star
tenor
mind
you
is
that
splendid
indeed
it
is
murmured
alice
belle
writes
that
hugh
says
he
improved
wonderfully
and
that
even
he
can
see
that
his
singing
is
marvelous
he
says
paris
is
wild
over
him
but
for
my
part
i
wish
he
come
home
and
stay
here
where
he
belongs
finished
billy
a
bit
petulantly
why
why
billy
murmured
her
friend
a
curiously
startled
look
coming
into
her
eyes
well
i
do
maintained
billy
then
recklessly
she
added
i
had
such
beautiful
plans
for
him
once
alice
oh
if
you
only
could
have
cared
for
him
you
have
made
such
a
splendid
couple
a
vivid
scarlet
flew
to
alice
face
nonsense
she
cried
getting
quickly
to
her
feet
and
bending
over
one
of
the
flower
boxes
along
the
veranda
railing
mr
arkwright
never
thought
of
marrying
me
and
i
not
going
to
marry
anybody
but
my
billy
sighed
despairingly
i
know
that
what
you
say
now
but
if
she
stopped
abruptly
around
the
turn
of
the
veranda
had
appeared
aunt
hannah
wheeling
bertram
still
asleep
in
his
carriage
i
came
out
the
other
door
she
explained
softly
and
it
was
so
lovely
i
just
had
to
go
in
and
get
the
baby
i
thought
it
would
be
so
nice
for
him
to
finish
his
nap
out
billy
arose
with
a
troubled
frown
but
aunt
hannah
he
must
he
ca
stay
out
here
i
sorry
but
we
have
to
take
him
aunt
hannah
eyes
grew
mutinous
but
i
thought
the
outdoor
air
was
just
the
thing
for
him
i
sure
your
scientific
hygienic
nonsense
says
they
do
they
did
that
is
some
of
them
do
acknowledged
billy
worriedly
but
they
differ
so
and
the
one
i
going
by
now
says
that
baby
should
always
sleep
in
an
temperature
seventy
degrees
if
possible
and
that
exactly
what
the
room
in
there
was
when
i
left
him
it
not
the
same
out
here
i
sure
in
fact
i
looked
at
the
thermometer
to
see
just
before
i
came
out
myself
so
aunt
hannah
afraid
i
have
to
take
him
but
you
used
to
have
him
sleep
out
of
doors
all
the
time
on
that
little
balcony
out
of
your
room
argued
aunt
hannah
still
plainly
unconvinced
yes
i
know
i
did
i
was
following
the
other
man
rules
then
as
i
said
if
only
they
would
differ
so
of
course
i
want
the
best
but
it
so
hard
to
always
know
the
best
and
at
this
very
inopportune
moment
master
bertram
took
occasion
to
wake
up
which
brought
even
a
deeper
wrinkle
of
worry
to
his
fond
forehead
for
she
said
that
according
to
the
clock
he
should
have
been
sleeping
exactly
ten
and
more
minutes
and
that
of
course
he
could
commence
the
next
thing
until
those
ten
and
minutes
were
up
or
else
his
entire
schedule
for
the
day
would
be
shattered
so
what
she
should
do
with
him
for
those
ten
minutes
and
a
half
she
did
not
know
all
of
which
drew
from
aunt
hannah
the
astounding
exclamation
of
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
billy
if
you
are
the
the
limit
which
indeed
she
must
have
been
to
have
brought
circumspect
aunt
hannah
to
the
point
of
actually
using
slang
chapter
xxiv
a
night
off
the
henshaw
family
did
not
return
to
the
strata
until
late
in
september
billy
said
that
the
sea
air
seemed
to
agree
so
well
with
the
baby
it
would
be
a
pity
to
change
until
the
weather
became
really
too
cool
at
the
shore
to
be
comfortable
william
came
back
from
his
fishing
trip
in
august
and
resumed
his
old
habit
of
sleeping
at
the
house
and
taking
his
meals
at
the
club
to
be
sure
for
a
week
he
went
back
and
forth
between
the
city
and
the
beach
house
but
it
happened
to
be
a
time
when
bertram
was
cutting
a
tooth
and
this
so
wore
upon
william
sympathy
william
still
could
not
help
insisting
it
be
a
pin
that
he
concluded
peace
lay
only
in
flight
so
he
went
back
to
the
strata
bertram
had
stayed
at
the
cottage
all
summer
painting
industriously
heretofore
he
had
taken
more
of
a
vacation
through
the
summer
months
but
this
year
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
to
paint
he
did
not
like
to
go
away
on
a
trip
and
leave
billy
and
she
declared
she
could
not
take
the
baby
nor
leave
him
and
that
she
did
not
need
any
trip
anyway
all
right
then
we
just
stay
at
the
beach
and
have
a
fine
vacation
together
he
had
answered
her
as
bertram
saw
it
however
he
could
detect
very
little
vacation
to
it
billy
had
no
time
for
anything
but
the
baby
when
she
was
not
actually
engaged
in
caring
for
it
she
was
studying
how
to
care
for
it
never
had
she
been
sweeter
or
dearer
and
never
had
bertram
loved
her
half
so
well
he
was
proud
too
of
her
devotion
and
of
her
triumphant
success
as
a
mother
but
he
did
wish
that
sometimes
just
once
in
a
while
she
would
remember
she
was
a
wife
and
pay
a
little
attention
to
him
her
husband
bertram
was
ashamed
to
own
it
even
to
himself
but
he
was
feeling
just
a
little
abused
that
summer
and
he
knew
that
in
his
heart
he
was
actually
getting
jealous
of
his
own
son
in
spite
of
his
adoration
of
the
little
fellow
he
told
himself
defensively
that
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
he
should
not
want
the
love
of
his
wife
the
attentions
of
his
wife
and
the
companionship
of
his
wife
a
part
of
the
time
it
was
nothing
more
than
natural
that
occasionally
he
should
like
to
see
her
show
some
interest
in
subjects
not
mentioned
in
mothers
guides
and
scientific
trainings
of
infants
and
he
did
not
believe
he
could
be
blamed
for
wanting
his
residence
to
be
a
home
for
himself
as
well
as
a
nursery
for
his
offspring
even
while
he
thus
discontentedly
argued
with
himself
however
bertram
called
himself
a
selfish
brute
just
to
think
such
things
when
he
had
so
dear
and
loving
a
wife
as
billy
and
so
fine
and
splendid
a
baby
as
bertram
jr
he
told
himself
too
that
very
likely
when
they
were
back
in
their
own
house
again
and
when
motherhood
was
not
so
new
to
her
billy
would
not
be
so
absorbed
in
the
baby
she
would
return
to
her
old
interest
in
her
husband
her
music
her
friends
and
her
own
personal
appearance
meanwhile
there
was
always
of
course
for
him
his
painting
so
he
would
paint
accepting
gladly
what
crumbs
of
attention
fell
from
the
baby
table
and
trust
to
the
future
to
make
billy
none
the
less
a
mother
perhaps
but
a
little
more
the
wife
just
how
confidently
he
was
counting
on
this
coming
change
bertram
hardly
realized
himself
but
certainly
the
family
was
scarcely
settled
at
the
strata
before
the
husband
gayly
proposed
one
evening
that
he
and
billy
should
go
to
the
theater
to
see
romeo
and
billy
was
clearly
both
surprised
and
shocked
why
bertram
i
ca
you
know
i
ca
she
exclaimed
reprovingly
bertram
heart
sank
but
he
kept
a
brave
front
why
not
what
a
question
as
if
i
leave
baby
but
billy
dear
you
be
gone
less
than
three
hours
and
you
say
delia
the
most
careful
of
billy
forehead
puckered
into
an
anxious
frown
i
ca
help
it
something
might
happen
to
him
bertram
i
could
be
happy
a
but
dearest
are
you
going
to
leave
him
demanded
the
young
husband
forlornly
why
yes
of
course
when
it
reasonable
and
necessary
i
went
out
to
the
annex
yesterday
afternoon
i
was
gone
almost
two
whole
well
did
anything
happen
but
then
i
telephoned
you
see
several
times
so
i
everything
was
all
oh
well
if
that
all
you
want
i
could
telephone
you
know
between
every
act
suggested
bertram
with
a
sarcasm
that
was
quite
lost
on
the
earnest
young
mother
you
could
do
that
could
you
conceded
billy
and
of
course
i
been
anywhere
much
indeed
i
could
agreed
bertram
with
a
promptness
that
carefully
hid
his
surprise
at
her
literal
acceptance
of
what
he
had
proposed
as
a
huge
joke
come
is
it
a
go
shall
i
telephone
to
see
if
i
can
get
seats
you
think
baby
surely
be
all
right
i
certainly
and
you
telephone
home
between
every
act
i
bertram
voice
sounded
almost
as
if
he
were
repeating
the
marriage
service
and
we
come
straight
home
afterwards
as
fast
as
john
and
peggy
can
bring
us
then
i
think
i
go
breathed
billy
tremulously
plainly
showing
what
a
momentous
concession
she
thought
she
was
making
i
do
love
and
juliet
and
i
have
seen
it
for
ages
good
then
i
find
out
about
the
tickets
cried
bertram
so
elated
at
the
prospect
of
having
an
evening
out
with
his
wife
that
even
the
telephones
did
not
seem
too
great
a
price
to
pay
when
the
time
came
they
were
a
little
late
in
starting
baby
was
fretful
and
though
billy
usually
laid
him
in
his
crib
and
unhesitatingly
left
the
room
insisting
that
he
should
go
to
sleep
by
himself
in
accordance
with
the
most
approved
rules
in
her
scientific
training
yet
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
the
point
of
leaving
the
house
until
he
was
quiet
hurried
as
they
were
when
they
did
start
billy
was
conscious
of
bertram
frowning
disapproval
of
her
frock
you
do
like
it
of
course
dear
and
i
do
blame
you
she
smiled
remorsefully
oh
i
like
it
that
is
i
did
when
it
was
new
rejoined
her
husband
with
apologetic
frankness
but
dear
did
you
have
anything
else
this
looks
almost
well
mussy
you
no
well
yes
maybe
there
were
others
admitted
billy
but
this
was
the
quickest
and
easiest
to
get
into
and
it
all
came
just
as
i
was
getting
baby
ready
for
bed
you
know
i
am
a
fright
though
acknowledge
so
far
as
clothes
go
i
have
had
time
to
get
a
thing
since
baby
came
i
must
get
something
right
away
i
yes
indeed
declared
bertram
with
emphasis
hurrying
his
wife
into
the
waiting
automobile
billy
had
to
apologize
again
at
the
theater
for
the
curtain
had
already
risen
on
the
ancient
quarrel
between
the
houses
of
capulet
and
montague
and
billy
knew
her
husband
special
abhorrence
of
tardy
arrivals
later
though
when
well
established
in
their
seats
billy
mind
was
plainly
not
with
the
players
on
the
stage
do
you
suppose
baby
all
right
she
whispered
after
a
time
of
course
he
is
dear
there
was
a
brief
silence
during
which
billy
peered
at
her
program
in
the
then
she
nudged
her
husband
arm
ecstatically
bertram
i
could
have
chosen
a
better
play
if
i
tried
there
are
acts
i
forgotten
there
were
so
many
that
means
you
can
telephone
four
times
yes
bertram
voice
was
sternly
cheerful
you
must
be
sure
they
tell
you
exactly
how
baby
all
right
dear
here
billy
subsided
she
even
clapped
a
little
in
spasmodic
enthusiasm
presently
she
peered
at
her
program
again
there
would
be
time
i
suppose
to
telephone
between
the
scenes
she
hazarded
wistfully
there
are
sixteen
of
those
well
hardly
billy
you
are
paying
one
bit
of
attention
to
the
play
why
of
course
i
am
whispered
billy
indignantly
i
think
perfectly
lovely
and
i
perfectly
contented
too
since
i
found
out
about
those
five
acts
and
as
long
as
i
have
the
sixteen
scenes
she
added
settling
back
in
her
seat
as
if
to
prove
that
she
was
interested
in
the
play
her
next
whisper
some
time
later
had
to
do
with
one
of
the
characters
on
the
stage
who
that
the
nurse
mercy
we
would
want
her
for
baby
would
we
in
spite
of
himself
bertram
chuckled
this
time
billy
too
laughed
at
herself
then
resolutely
she
settled
into
her
seat
again
the
curtain
was
not
fairly
down
on
the
first
act
before
billy
had
laid
an
urgent
hand
on
her
husband
arm
now
remember
ask
if
he
waked
up
or
anything
she
directed
and
be
sure
to
say
i
come
right
home
if
they
need
me
now
yes
bertram
rose
with
alacrity
i
be
back
right
oh
but
i
do
want
you
to
hurry
much
she
called
after
him
softly
i
want
you
to
take
plenty
of
time
to
ask
all
right
nodded
bertram
with
a
quizzical
smile
as
he
turned
away
obediently
bertram
asked
all
the
question
she
could
think
of
then
came
back
to
his
wife
there
was
nothing
in
his
report
that
even
billy
could
disapprove
of
or
worry
about
and
with
almost
a
contented
look
on
her
face
she
turned
toward
the
stage
as
the
curtain
went
up
on
the
second
act
i
love
this
balcony
scene
she
sighed
happily
romeo
however
had
not
half
finished
his
impassioned
when
billy
clutched
her
husband
arm
almost
fiercely
bertram
she
fairly
hissed
in
a
tragic
whisper
i
just
happened
to
think
wo
it
be
awful
when
baby
falls
in
love
i
know
i
shall
just
hate
that
girl
for
taking
him
away
from
me
expostulated
her
husband
choking
with
laughter
that
woman
in
front
heard
you
i
know
she
did
well
i
shall
sighed
billy
mournfully
turning
back
to
the
stage
night
good
night
parting
is
such
sweet
sorrow
that
i
shall
say
good
night
till
it
be
morrow
sighed
juliet
passionately
to
her
romeo
mercy
i
hope
not
whispered
billy
flippantly
in
bertram
ear
sure
i
do
want
to
stay
here
till
i
want
to
go
home
and
see
pleaded
bertram
so
despairingly
that
billy
really
sat
back
in
her
seat
and
remained
for
the
rest
of
the
act
very
quiet
indeed
deceived
by
her
apparent
tranquillity
bertram
turned
as
the
curtain
went
down
now
billy
surely
you
do
think
it
be
necessary
to
telephone
so
soon
as
this
again
he
ventured
billy
countenance
fell
but
bertram
you
you
would
of
course
if
you
are
willing
to
but
i
been
counting
on
hearing
all
through
this
horrid
long
act
and
goodness
me
billy
i
telephone
every
minute
for
you
of
course
if
you
want
me
to
cried
bertram
springing
to
his
feet
and
trying
not
to
show
his
impatience
he
was
back
more
promptly
this
time
everything
he
smiled
reassuringly
into
billy
anxious
eyes
delia
said
she
just
been
up
and
the
little
chap
was
sound
to
the
man
unbounded
surprise
his
wife
grew
actually
white
up
up
she
exclaimed
do
you
mean
that
delia
went
to
and
left
my
baby
up
there
alone
but
billy
she
said
he
was
all
right
murmured
bertram
softly
casting
uneasy
sidelong
glances
at
his
too
interested
neighbors
right
perhaps
he
was
but
he
may
not
be
later
delia
should
stay
in
the
next
room
all
the
time
where
she
could
hear
the
least
yes
dear
she
will
i
sure
if
you
tell
her
to
soothed
bertram
quickly
it
be
all
right
next
billy
shook
her
head
she
was
obviously
near
to
crying
but
bertram
i
ca
stand
it
to
sit
here
enjoying
myself
all
safe
and
comfortable
and
know
that
baby
is
up
there
in
that
great
big
room
please
wo
you
go
and
telephone
delia
to
go
up
and
stay
there
bertram
weary
sorely
tried
and
increasingly
aware
of
those
annoyingly
interested
neighbors
was
on
the
point
of
saying
a
very
decided
no
but
a
glance
into
billy
pleading
eyes
settled
it
without
a
word
he
went
back
to
the
telephone
the
curtain
was
up
when
he
slipped
into
his
seat
very
red
of
face
in
answer
to
billy
hurried
whisper
he
shook
his
head
but
in
the
short
pause
between
the
first
and
second
scenes
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
sorry
billy
but
i
could
get
the
house
at
could
get
them
but
you
just
been
talking
with
them
that
exactly
it
probably
i
had
just
telephoned
so
they
watching
for
the
bell
anyhow
i
could
get
then
you
did
get
delia
at
all
of
course
and
baby
is
still
all
alone
but
he
all
right
dear
delia
keeping
watch
of
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
then
with
clear
decisiveness
came
billy
voice
bertram
i
am
going
billy
i
billy
for
heaven
sake
do
be
a
silly
goose
the
play
half
over
already
we
soon
be
going
billy
lips
came
together
in
a
thin
little
determined
line
bertram
i
am
going
home
now
please
she
said
you
need
come
with
me
i
can
go
bertram
said
two
words
under
his
breath
which
it
was
just
as
well
perhaps
that
billy
and
the
neighbors
did
not
hear
then
he
gathered
up
their
wraps
and
with
billy
stalked
out
of
the
theater
at
home
everything
was
found
to
be
absolutely
as
it
should
be
bertram
was
peacefully
sleeping
and
delia
who
had
come
up
from
downstairs
was
sewing
in
the
next
room
there
you
see
observed
bertram
a
little
sourly
billy
drew
a
long
contented
sigh
yes
i
see
everything
is
all
right
but
that
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
do
bertram
you
know
to
for
she
finished
happily
and
bertram
looking
at
her
rapt
face
as
she
hovered
over
the
crib
called
himself
a
brute
and
a
beast
to
mind
that
could
make
billy
look
like
that
chapter
xxv
should
auld
acquaintance
be
forgot
bertram
did
not
ask
billy
very
soon
again
to
go
to
the
theater
for
some
days
indeed
he
did
not
ask
her
to
do
anything
then
one
evening
he
did
beg
for
some
music
billy
you
have
played
to
me
or
sung
to
me
since
i
could
remember
he
complained
i
want
some
billy
gave
a
merry
laugh
and
wriggled
her
fingers
experimentally
mercy
bertram
i
do
believe
i
could
play
a
note
you
know
i
all
out
of
but
why
you
practice
why
bertram
i
ca
in
the
first
place
i
do
seem
to
have
any
time
except
when
baby
asleep
and
i
ca
play
wake
him
bertram
sighed
irritably
rose
to
his
feet
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
he
came
to
a
pause
at
last
his
eyes
bent
a
trifle
disapprovingly
on
his
wife
billy
dear
you
wear
anything
but
those
wrapper
things
nowadays
he
asked
plaintively
again
billy
laughed
but
this
time
a
troubled
frown
followed
the
laugh
i
know
bertram
i
suppose
they
do
look
dowdy
sometimes
she
confessed
but
you
see
i
hate
to
wear
a
really
good
dress
baby
rumples
them
up
so
and
i
usually
in
a
hurry
to
get
to
him
mornings
and
these
are
so
easy
to
slip
into
and
so
much
more
comfortable
for
me
to
handle
him
in
yes
of
course
of
course
i
see
mumbled
bertram
listlessly
taking
up
his
walk
again
billy
after
a
moment
silence
began
to
talk
animatedly
baby
had
done
a
wonderfully
cunning
thing
that
morning
and
billy
had
not
had
a
chance
yet
to
tell
bertram
baby
was
growing
more
and
more
cunning
anyway
these
days
and
there
were
several
things
she
believed
she
had
not
told
him
so
she
told
them
now
bertram
listened
politely
interestedly
he
told
himself
that
he
interested
too
of
course
he
was
interested
in
the
doings
of
his
own
child
but
he
still
walked
up
and
down
the
room
a
little
restlessly
coming
to
a
halt
at
last
by
the
window
across
which
the
shade
had
not
been
drawn
billy
he
cried
suddenly
with
his
old
boyish
eagerness
a
glorious
moon
come
on
let
take
a
little
walk
a
real
walk
will
you
mercy
dear
i
could
cried
billy
springing
to
her
feet
i
love
to
though
if
i
could
she
added
hastily
as
she
saw
disappointment
cloud
her
husband
face
but
i
told
delia
she
might
go
out
it
her
regular
evening
of
course
but
i
told
her
i
did
mind
staying
with
baby
a
bit
so
i
have
to
go
right
up
now
she
be
going
soon
but
dear
you
go
and
take
your
walk
it
do
you
good
then
you
can
come
back
and
tell
me
all
about
it
only
you
must
come
in
quietly
so
not
to
wake
the
baby
she
finished
giving
her
husband
an
affectionate
kiss
as
she
left
the
room
after
a
disconsolate
five
minutes
of
solitude
bertram
got
his
hat
and
coat
and
went
out
for
his
walk
but
he
told
himself
he
did
not
expect
to
enjoy
it
bertram
henshaw
knew
that
the
old
rebellious
jealousy
of
the
summer
had
him
fast
in
its
grip
he
was
heartily
ashamed
of
himself
but
he
could
not
help
it
he
wanted
billy
and
he
wanted
her
then
he
wanted
to
talk
to
her
he
wanted
to
tell
her
about
a
new
portrait
commission
he
had
just
obtained
and
he
wanted
to
ask
her
what
she
thought
of
the
idea
of
a
face
of
a
girl
for
the
bohemian
ten
exhibition
next
march
he
wanted
but
then
what
would
be
the
use
she
would
listen
of
course
but
he
would
know
by
the
very
looks
of
her
face
that
she
would
not
be
really
thinking
of
what
he
was
saying
and
he
would
be
willing
to
wager
his
best
canvas
that
in
the
very
first
pause
she
would
tell
about
the
baby
newest
tooth
or
latest
toy
not
but
that
he
liked
to
hear
about
the
little
fellow
of
course
and
not
but
that
he
was
proud
as
punch
of
him
too
but
that
he
would
like
sometimes
to
hear
billy
talk
of
something
else
the
sweetest
melody
in
the
world
if
dinned
into
ears
day
and
night
became
something
to
be
fled
from
and
billy
ought
to
talk
of
something
else
too
bertram
wonderful
as
he
was
really
was
not
the
only
thing
in
the
world
or
even
the
only
baby
and
other
people
outsiders
their
friends
had
a
right
to
expect
that
sometimes
other
matters
might
be
considered
their
own
for
instance
but
billy
seemed
to
have
forgotten
this
no
matter
whether
the
subject
of
conversation
had
to
do
with
the
latest
novel
or
a
trip
to
europe
under
billy
guidance
it
invariably
led
straight
to
book
or
to
a
perambulator
journey
in
the
public
garden
if
it
had
not
been
so
serious
it
would
have
been
really
funny
the
way
all
roads
led
straight
to
one
goal
he
himself
when
alone
with
billy
had
started
the
most
unusual
and
foreign
subjects
sometimes
just
to
see
if
there
were
not
somewhere
a
little
bypath
that
did
not
bring
up
in
his
own
nursery
he
never
however
found
one
but
it
was
not
funny
it
was
serious
was
this
glorious
gift
on
parenthood
to
which
he
had
looked
forward
as
the
crowning
joy
of
his
existence
to
be
nothing
but
a
tragedy
that
would
finally
wreck
his
domestic
happiness
it
could
not
be
it
must
not
be
he
must
be
patient
and
wait
billy
loved
him
he
was
sure
she
did
by
and
by
this
obsession
of
motherhood
which
had
her
so
fast
in
its
grasp
would
relax
she
would
remember
that
her
husband
had
rights
as
well
as
her
child
once
again
she
would
give
him
the
companionship
love
and
sympathetic
interest
so
dear
to
him
meanwhile
there
was
his
work
he
must
bury
himself
in
that
and
fortunate
indeed
he
was
he
told
himself
that
he
had
something
so
absorbing
it
was
at
this
point
in
his
meditations
that
bertram
rounded
a
corner
and
came
face
to
face
with
a
man
who
stopped
him
short
with
a
jovial
is
it
by
george
it
is
bertie
henshaw
well
what
do
you
think
of
that
for
luck
and
me
only
two
days
home
from
paree
oh
seaver
how
are
you
you
a
stranger
bertram
voice
and
handshake
were
a
bit
more
cordial
than
they
would
have
been
had
he
not
at
the
moment
been
feeling
so
abused
and
forlorn
in
the
old
days
he
had
liked
this
bob
seaver
well
seaver
was
an
artist
like
himself
and
was
good
company
always
but
seaver
and
his
crowd
were
a
little
too
bohemian
for
william
taste
and
after
billy
came
she
too
had
objected
to
what
she
called
that
horrid
seaver
in
his
heart
bertram
knew
that
there
was
good
foundation
for
their
objections
so
he
had
avoided
seaver
for
a
time
and
for
some
years
now
the
man
had
been
abroad
somewhat
to
bertram
relief
however
seaver
genial
smile
and
hearty
friendliness
were
like
a
sudden
burst
of
sunshine
on
a
rainy
day
and
bertram
detested
rainy
days
he
was
feeling
now
too
as
if
he
had
just
had
a
whole
week
of
them
yes
i
am
something
of
a
stranger
here
nodded
seaver
but
i
tell
you
what
little
old
boston
looks
mighty
good
to
me
all
the
same
come
on
you
just
the
fellow
we
want
i
on
my
way
now
to
the
old
stamping
ground
come
right
about
face
old
chap
and
come
with
me
bertram
shook
his
head
sorry
but
i
guess
i
ca
he
sighed
both
gesture
and
words
were
unhesitating
but
the
voice
carried
the
discontent
of
a
small
boy
who
while
the
sun
is
still
shining
has
been
told
to
come
into
the
house
oh
rats
yes
you
can
too
come
on
lots
of
the
old
crowd
will
be
there
griggs
beebe
jack
jenkins
and
tully
we
need
you
to
complete
the
jack
jenkins
is
he
here
a
new
eagerness
had
come
into
voice
sure
he
came
on
from
new
york
last
night
great
boy
jenkins
just
back
from
paris
fairly
covered
with
medals
you
yes
so
i
hear
i
have
seen
him
for
four
better
come
began
bertram
with
obvious
reluctance
it
already
nine
and
nine
cut
in
seaver
with
a
broad
grin
since
when
has
your
limit
been
nine
i
seen
the
time
when
you
did
mind
nine
in
the
morning
bertie
what
got
oh
i
remember
i
met
another
friend
of
yours
in
berlin
chap
named
arkwright
and
say
some
singer
you
bet
you
going
to
hear
of
him
one
of
these
days
well
he
told
me
all
about
how
you
settled
down
now
son
and
heir
fireside
bliss
pretty
wife
and
all
the
fixings
but
i
say
bertie
does
she
let
you
out
nonsense
seaver
flared
bertram
in
annoyed
wrath
well
then
why
do
you
come
if
you
want
to
see
jenkins
you
have
to
he
going
back
to
new
york
for
only
a
brief
minute
longer
did
bertram
hesitate
then
he
turned
squarely
about
with
an
air
of
finality
is
he
well
then
perhaps
i
will
he
said
i
hate
to
miss
jenkins
good
exclaimed
his
companion
as
they
fell
into
step
have
a
cigar
thanks
do
mind
if
i
if
bertram
chin
was
a
little
higher
and
his
step
a
little
more
decided
than
usual
it
was
all
merely
by
way
of
accompaniment
to
his
thoughts
certainly
it
was
right
that
he
should
go
and
it
was
sensible
indeed
it
was
really
almost
imperative
due
to
billy
as
it
were
after
that
disagreeable
taunt
of
seaver
as
if
she
did
not
want
him
to
go
when
and
where
he
pleased
as
if
she
would
consent
for
a
moment
to
figure
in
the
eyes
of
his
friends
as
a
tyrannical
wife
who
objected
to
her
husband
passing
a
social
evening
with
his
friends
to
be
sure
in
this
particular
case
she
might
not
favor
seaver
presence
but
even
she
would
not
mind
this
once
and
anyhow
it
was
jenkins
that
was
the
attraction
not
seaver
besides
he
himself
was
no
undeveloped
boy
now
he
was
a
man
presumedly
able
to
take
care
of
himself
besides
again
had
not
billy
herself
told
him
to
go
out
and
enjoy
the
evening
without
her
as
she
had
to
stay
with
the
baby
he
would
telephone
her
of
course
that
he
had
met
some
old
friends
and
that
he
might
be
late
then
she
would
not
worry
and
forthwith
having
settled
the
matter
in
his
mind
and
to
his
complete
satisfaction
bertram
gave
his
undivided
attention
to
seaver
who
had
already
plunged
into
an
account
of
a
recent
art
exhibition
he
had
attended
in
paris
chapter
xxvi
ghosts
that
walked
for
bertram
october
proved
to
be
unusually
mild
and
about
the
middle
of
the
month
bertram
after
much
unselfish
urging
on
the
part
of
billy
went
to
a
friend
camp
in
the
adirondacks
for
a
week
stay
he
came
back
with
an
angry
lugubrious
face
and
a
broken
arm
oh
bertram
and
your
right
one
too
the
same
one
you
broke
before
mourned
billy
tearfully
of
course
retorted
bertram
trying
in
vain
to
give
an
air
of
jauntiness
to
his
reply
did
want
to
be
too
changeable
you
know
but
how
did
you
do
it
dear
fell
into
a
silly
little
hole
covered
with
underbrush
but
oh
billy
what
the
use
i
did
it
and
i
ca
undo
it
more
the
pity
of
course
you
ca
you
poor
boy
sympathized
billy
and
you
be
tormented
with
questions
we
just
be
thankful
was
no
worse
you
ca
paint
for
a
while
of
course
but
we
wo
mind
that
it
just
give
baby
and
me
a
chance
to
have
you
all
to
ourselves
for
a
time
and
we
love
that
yes
of
course
sighed
bertram
so
abstractedly
that
billy
bridled
with
pretty
resentment
well
i
like
your
enthusiasm
sir
she
frowned
i
afraid
you
appreciate
the
blessings
you
do
have
young
man
did
you
realize
what
i
said
i
remarked
that
you
could
be
with
and
she
emphasized
bertram
laughed
and
gave
his
wife
an
affectionate
kiss
indeed
i
do
appreciate
my
blessings
dear
when
those
blessings
are
such
treasures
as
you
and
baby
but
only
his
doleful
eyes
fixed
on
his
injured
arm
finished
his
sentence
i
know
dear
of
course
and
i
understand
murmured
billy
all
tenderness
at
once
they
were
not
easy
for
bertram
those
following
days
once
again
he
was
obliged
to
accept
the
little
intimate
personal
services
that
he
so
disliked
once
again
he
could
do
nothing
but
read
or
wander
disconsolately
into
his
studio
and
gaze
at
his
face
of
a
occasionally
it
is
true
driven
nearly
to
desperation
by
the
haunting
vision
in
his
mind
eye
he
picked
up
a
brush
and
attempted
to
make
his
left
hand
serve
his
will
but
a
bare
irritating
ineffectual
strokes
were
usually
enough
to
make
him
throw
down
his
brush
in
disgust
he
never
could
do
anything
with
his
left
hand
he
told
himself
dejectedly
many
of
his
hours
of
course
he
spent
with
billy
and
his
son
and
they
were
happy
hours
too
but
they
always
came
to
be
restless
ones
before
the
day
was
half
over
billy
was
always
devotion
itself
to
him
when
she
was
not
attending
to
the
baby
he
had
no
fault
to
find
with
billy
and
the
baby
was
delightful
he
could
find
no
fault
with
the
baby
but
the
baby
fretful
he
was
teething
billy
said
and
he
needed
a
great
deal
of
attention
so
naturally
bertram
drifted
out
of
the
nursery
after
a
time
and
went
down
into
his
studio
where
were
his
dear
empty
palette
his
orderly
brushes
and
his
tantalizing
face
of
a
from
the
studio
generally
bertram
went
out
on
to
the
street
sometimes
he
dropped
into
a
studio
sometimes
he
strolled
into
a
club
or
café
where
he
knew
he
would
be
likely
to
find
some
friend
who
would
help
him
while
away
a
tiresome
hour
friends
quite
vied
with
each
other
in
rendering
this
sort
of
aid
so
much
so
indeed
that
naturally
perhaps
bertram
came
to
call
on
their
services
more
and
more
frequently
particularly
was
this
the
case
when
after
the
splints
were
removed
bertram
found
as
the
days
passed
that
his
arm
was
not
improving
as
it
should
improve
this
not
only
disappointed
and
annoyed
him
but
worried
him
he
remembered
sundry
disquieting
warnings
given
by
the
physician
at
the
time
of
the
former
break
warnings
concerning
the
probable
seriousness
of
a
repetition
of
the
injury
to
billy
of
course
bertram
said
nothing
of
all
this
but
just
before
christmas
he
went
to
see
a
noted
specialist
an
hour
later
almost
in
front
of
the
learned
surgeon
door
bertram
met
bob
seaver
great
scott
bertie
what
up
ejaculated
seaver
you
look
as
if
you
seen
a
i
have
answered
bertram
with
grim
bitterness
i
seen
the
ghost
of
of
every
of
a
girl
i
ever
gorry
so
bad
as
that
no
wonder
you
look
as
if
you
been
disporting
in
graveyards
chuckled
seaver
laughing
at
his
own
joke
what
the
matter
arm
on
a
rampage
to
day
he
paused
for
reply
but
as
bertram
did
not
answer
at
once
he
resumed
with
gay
insistence
come
on
you
need
cheering
up
suppose
we
go
down
to
trentini
and
see
who
all
right
agreed
bertram
dully
suit
bertram
was
not
thinking
of
seaver
trentini
or
whom
he
might
find
there
bertram
was
thinking
of
certain
words
he
had
heard
less
than
half
an
hour
ago
he
was
wondering
too
if
ever
again
he
could
think
of
anything
but
those
words
the
truth
the
great
surgeon
had
said
well
the
truth
is
i
sorry
to
tell
you
the
truth
henshaw
but
if
you
will
have
it
painted
the
last
picture
you
ever
paint
with
your
right
hand
i
fear
it
a
bad
case
this
break
coming
as
it
did
on
top
of
the
serious
injury
of
two
or
three
years
ago
was
bad
enough
but
to
make
matters
worse
the
bone
was
imperfectly
set
and
wrongly
treated
which
could
not
be
helped
of
course
as
you
were
miles
away
from
skilled
surgeons
at
the
time
of
the
injury
we
do
the
best
we
can
of
course
but
well
you
asked
for
the
truth
you
remember
so
i
had
to
give
it
to
chapter
xxvii
the
mother
the
wife
bertram
made
up
his
mind
at
once
that
for
the
present
at
least
he
would
tell
no
one
what
the
surgeon
had
said
to
him
he
had
placed
himself
under
the
man
care
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
take
the
prescribed
treatment
and
await
results
as
patiently
as
he
could
meanwhile
there
was
no
need
to
worry
billy
or
william
or
anybody
else
with
the
matter
billy
was
so
busy
with
her
holiday
plans
that
she
was
only
vaguely
aware
of
what
seemed
to
be
an
increase
of
restlessness
on
the
part
of
her
husband
during
those
days
just
before
christmas
poor
dear
is
the
arm
feeling
horrid
she
asked
one
morning
when
the
gloom
on
her
husband
face
was
deeper
than
usual
bertram
frowned
and
did
not
answer
directly
lots
of
good
i
am
these
days
he
exclaimed
his
moody
eyes
on
the
armful
of
packages
she
carried
what
are
those
tree
yes
and
it
going
to
be
so
pretty
bertram
exulted
billy
and
do
you
know
baby
positively
acts
as
if
he
suspected
things
little
as
he
is
she
went
on
eagerly
he
as
nervous
as
a
witch
i
ca
keep
him
still
a
minute
how
about
his
mother
hinted
bertram
with
a
faint
smile
billy
laughed
well
i
afraid
she
is
exactly
calm
herself
she
confessed
as
she
hurried
out
of
the
room
with
her
parcels
bertram
looked
after
her
longingly
despondently
i
wonder
what
she
say
if
she
knew
he
muttered
but
she
know
till
she
just
has
to
he
vowed
suddenly
under
his
breath
striding
into
the
hall
for
his
hat
and
coat
never
had
the
strata
known
such
a
christmas
as
this
was
planned
to
be
cyril
marie
and
the
twins
were
to
be
there
also
kate
her
husband
and
three
children
paul
egbert
and
little
kate
from
the
west
on
christmas
day
there
was
to
be
a
big
family
dinner
with
aunt
hannah
down
from
the
annex
then
in
concession
to
the
extreme
youth
of
the
young
host
and
his
twin
cousins
there
was
to
be
an
afternoon
tree
the
shades
were
to
be
drawn
and
the
candles
lighted
however
so
that
there
might
be
no
loss
of
effect
in
the
evening
the
tree
was
to
be
once
more
loaded
with
fascinating
packages
and
and
this
time
the
greggorys
tommy
dunn
and
all
the
rest
from
the
annex
were
to
have
the
fun
all
over
again
from
garret
to
basement
the
strata
was
aflame
with
holly
and
aglitter
with
tinsel
nowhere
did
there
seem
to
be
a
spot
that
did
not
have
its
bit
of
tissue
paper
or
its
trail
of
red
ribbon
and
everything
holly
ribbon
tissue
and
tinsel
led
to
the
mysteriously
closed
doors
of
the
great
front
past
which
none
but
billy
and
her
accredited
messengers
might
venture
no
wonder
indeed
that
even
baby
scented
excitement
and
that
baby
mother
was
not
exactly
calm
no
wonder
too
that
bertram
with
his
helpless
right
arm
and
his
heavy
heart
felt
peculiarly
forlorn
and
out
of
no
wonder
also
that
he
took
himself
literally
out
of
it
with
growing
frequency
and
hartwell
and
little
kate
were
to
stay
at
the
strata
the
boys
paul
and
egbert
were
to
go
to
cyril
promptly
at
the
appointed
time
two
days
before
christmas
they
arrived
and
from
that
hour
until
two
days
after
christmas
when
the
last
bit
of
holly
ribbon
tissue
and
tinsel
disappeared
from
the
floor
billy
moved
in
a
whirl
of
anxious
responsibility
that
was
yet
filled
with
fun
frolic
and
laughter
it
was
a
great
success
the
whole
affair
everybody
seemed
pleased
and
happy
that
is
everybody
but
bertram
and
he
very
plainly
tried
to
seem
pleased
and
happy
even
cyril
unbent
to
the
extent
of
not
appearing
to
mind
the
noise
one
bit
and
sister
kate
bertram
said
found
only
the
extraordinarily
small
number
of
four
details
to
change
in
the
arrangements
baby
obligingly
let
his
go
for
the
occasion
and
he
and
the
twins
franz
and
felix
were
the
admiration
and
delight
of
all
little
kate
to
be
sure
was
a
trifle
disconcerting
once
or
twice
but
everybody
was
too
absorbed
to
pay
much
attention
to
her
billy
did
however
remember
her
opening
remarks
well
little
kate
do
you
remember
me
billy
had
greeted
her
pleasantly
oh
yes
little
kate
had
answered
with
a
winning
smile
you
my
aunt
billy
what
married
my
uncle
bertram
instead
of
uncle
william
as
you
said
you
would
everybody
laughed
and
billy
colored
of
course
but
little
kate
went
on
eagerly
and
i
been
wanting
just
awfully
to
see
you
she
announced
have
you
i
glad
i
sure
i
feel
highly
flattered
smiled
billy
well
i
have
you
see
i
wanted
to
ask
you
something
have
you
ever
wished
that
you
married
uncle
william
instead
of
uncle
bertram
or
that
you
tried
for
uncle
cyril
before
aunty
marie
got
him
kate
gasped
her
horrified
mother
i
told
you
you
see
she
broke
off
turning
to
billy
despairingly
she
been
pestering
me
with
questions
like
that
ever
since
she
knew
she
was
coming
she
never
has
forgotten
the
way
you
changed
from
one
uncle
to
the
other
you
may
remember
it
made
a
great
impression
on
her
at
the
yes
i
i
remember
stammered
billy
trying
to
laugh
off
her
embarrassment
but
you
have
told
me
yet
whether
you
did
wish
you
married
uncle
william
or
uncle
cyril
interposed
little
kate
persistently
no
no
of
course
not
exclaimed
billy
with
a
vivid
blush
casting
her
eyes
about
for
a
door
of
escape
and
rejoicing
greatly
when
she
spied
delia
with
the
baby
coming
toward
them
there
look
my
dear
here
your
new
cousin
little
bertram
she
exclaimed
do
you
want
to
see
him
little
kate
turned
dutifully
yes
aunt
billy
but
i
rather
see
the
twins
mother
says
real
pretty
and
er
they
are
murmured
billy
on
whom
the
emphasis
of
the
they
had
not
been
lost
naturally
as
may
be
supposed
therefore
billy
had
not
forgotten
little
kate
opening
remarks
immediately
after
christmas
hartwell
and
the
boys
went
back
to
their
western
home
leaving
hartwell
and
her
daughter
to
make
a
round
of
visits
to
friends
in
the
east
for
almost
a
week
after
christmas
they
remained
at
the
strata
and
it
was
on
the
last
day
of
their
stay
that
little
kate
asked
the
question
that
proved
so
momentous
in
results
billy
almost
unconsciously
had
avoided
with
her
small
guest
but
they
were
alone
together
aunt
billy
began
the
little
girl
after
a
meditative
gaze
into
the
other
face
you
married
to
uncle
bertram
are
you
i
certainly
am
my
dear
smiled
billy
trying
to
speak
unconcernedly
well
then
what
makes
you
forget
it
what
makes
me
forget
why
child
what
a
question
what
do
you
mean
i
do
forget
it
exclaimed
billy
indignantly
then
what
mother
mean
i
heard
her
tell
uncle
william
myself
she
did
know
i
heard
though
that
she
did
wish
you
remember
you
were
uncle
bertram
wife
as
well
as
cousin
bertram
billy
flushed
scarlet
then
grew
very
white
at
that
moment
hartwell
came
into
the
room
little
kate
turned
triumphantly
there
she
has
forgotten
and
i
knew
she
had
mother
i
asked
her
just
now
and
she
said
she
had
what
questioned
hartwell
looking
a
little
apprehensively
at
her
white
face
and
angry
eyes
had
forgotten
that
she
was
uncle
bertram
kate
interposed
billy
steadily
meeting
her
gaze
will
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
what
this
child
is
talking
about
hartwell
sighed
and
gave
an
impatient
gesture
kate
i
a
mind
to
take
you
home
on
the
next
train
she
said
to
her
daughter
run
away
now
your
aunt
billy
and
i
want
to
talk
come
come
hurry
i
mean
what
i
say
she
added
warningly
as
she
saw
unmistakable
signs
of
rebellion
on
the
small
young
face
i
wish
pouted
little
kate
rising
reluctantly
and
moving
toward
the
door
that
you
did
always
send
me
away
just
when
i
wanted
most
to
stay
well
kate
prompted
billy
as
the
door
closed
behind
the
little
girl
yes
i
suppose
i
have
to
say
it
now
as
long
as
that
child
has
put
her
finger
in
the
pie
but
i
had
intended
to
speak
no
matter
what
i
saw
i
promised
myself
i
would
before
i
came
i
know
of
course
how
bertram
and
cyril
and
william
too
say
that
i
always
interfering
in
affairs
that
do
concern
me
though
for
that
matter
if
my
own
brother
affairs
do
concern
me
i
do
know
whose
should
but
as
i
said
i
was
going
to
speak
this
time
no
matter
what
i
saw
and
i
have
except
to
william
and
cyril
and
aunt
hannah
but
i
suppose
somewhere
little
kate
got
hold
of
it
it
simply
this
billy
it
seems
to
me
it
high
time
you
began
to
realize
that
you
wife
as
well
as
the
baby
that
i
am
i
do
think
i
quite
understand
said
billy
unsteadily
no
i
suppose
you
do
sighed
kate
though
where
your
eyes
are
i
do
see
or
rather
i
do
see
they
on
the
baby
it
all
very
well
and
lovely
billy
to
be
a
devoted
mother
and
you
certainly
are
that
i
say
that
much
for
you
and
i
admit
i
never
thought
you
would
be
but
you
see
what
you
doing
to
bertram
to
bertram
by
being
a
devoted
mother
to
his
son
yes
doing
to
bertram
ca
you
see
what
a
change
there
is
in
the
boy
he
does
act
like
himself
at
all
he
restless
and
gloomy
and
entirely
out
of
yes
i
know
but
that
his
arm
pleaded
billy
poor
boy
he
so
tired
of
it
kate
shook
her
head
decisively
it
more
than
his
arm
billy
you
see
it
yourself
if
you
blinded
by
your
absorption
in
that
baby
where
is
bertram
every
evening
where
is
he
daytimes
do
you
realize
that
he
been
at
home
scarcely
one
evening
since
i
came
and
as
for
the
days
he
almost
never
but
kate
he
ca
paint
now
you
know
so
of
course
he
need
to
stay
so
closely
at
home
defended
billy
he
goes
out
to
find
distraction
from
yes
indeed
sniffed
kate
and
where
do
you
suppose
he
finds
it
do
you
where
he
finds
it
i
tell
you
billy
bertram
henshaw
is
not
the
sort
of
man
that
should
find
too
much
outside
his
home
his
tastes
and
his
temperament
are
altogether
too
bohemian
and
billy
interrupted
with
a
peremptorily
upraised
hand
please
remember
kate
you
are
speaking
of
my
husband
to
his
wife
and
his
wife
has
perfect
confidence
in
him
and
is
just
a
little
particular
as
to
what
you
yes
well
i
speaking
of
my
brother
too
whom
i
know
very
well
shrugged
kate
all
is
you
may
remember
sometime
that
i
warned
you
that
all
this
trusting
business
is
all
very
pretty
but
i
think
be
a
lot
prettier
and
a
vast
deal
more
sensible
if
you
give
him
a
little
attention
as
well
as
trust
and
see
if
you
ca
keep
him
at
home
a
bit
more
at
least
you
know
whom
he
with
then
cyril
says
he
saw
him
last
week
with
bob
with
bob
seaver
faltered
billy
changing
color
yes
i
see
you
remember
him
smiled
kate
not
quite
agreeably
perhaps
now
you
take
some
stock
in
what
i
said
and
remember
i
remember
it
certainly
returned
billy
a
little
proudly
said
a
good
many
things
to
me
in
the
past
hartwell
and
remembered
them
all
every
it
was
kate
turn
to
flush
and
she
did
it
yes
i
know
and
i
presume
very
likely
sometimes
there
been
much
foundation
for
what
i
said
i
think
this
time
however
find
there
is
she
finished
with
an
air
of
hurt
dignity
billy
made
no
reply
perhaps
because
delia
at
that
moment
brought
in
the
baby
hartwell
and
little
kate
left
the
strata
the
next
morning
until
then
billy
contrived
to
keep
before
them
a
countenance
serene
and
a
manner
free
from
unrest
even
when
after
dinner
that
evening
bertram
put
on
his
hat
and
coat
and
went
out
billy
refused
to
meet
her
meaning
gaze
but
in
the
morning
after
they
had
left
the
house
billy
did
not
attempt
to
deceive
herself
determinedly
then
she
set
herself
to
going
over
in
her
mind
the
past
months
since
the
baby
came
and
she
was
appalled
at
what
she
found
ever
in
her
ears
too
was
that
feared
name
bob
seaver
and
ever
before
her
eyes
was
that
night
years
ago
when
as
an
girl
she
had
followed
bertram
and
bob
seaver
into
a
glittering
café
at
eleven
at
night
because
bertram
had
been
drinking
and
was
not
himself
she
remembered
bertram
face
when
he
had
seen
her
and
what
he
had
said
when
she
begged
him
to
come
home
she
remembered
too
what
the
family
had
said
afterward
but
she
remembered
also
that
years
later
bertram
had
told
her
what
that
escapade
of
hers
had
really
done
for
him
and
that
he
believed
he
had
actually
loved
her
from
that
moment
after
that
night
at
all
events
he
had
had
little
to
do
with
bob
seaver
and
now
seaver
was
back
again
it
seemed
and
with
bertram
they
had
been
seen
together
but
if
they
had
what
could
she
do
surely
she
could
hardly
now
follow
them
into
a
public
café
and
demand
that
seaver
let
her
husband
come
home
but
she
could
keep
him
at
home
perhaps
billy
quite
brightened
at
this
thought
kate
had
said
that
she
was
so
absorbed
in
baby
that
her
husband
received
no
attention
at
all
billy
did
not
believe
this
was
true
but
if
it
were
true
she
could
at
least
rectify
that
mistake
if
it
were
attention
that
he
wanted
he
should
want
no
more
poor
bertram
no
wonder
that
he
had
sought
distraction
outside
when
one
had
a
horrid
broken
arm
that
would
not
let
one
do
anything
what
else
could
one
do
just
here
billy
suddenly
remembered
the
book
a
talk
to
young
if
she
recollected
rightly
there
was
a
chapter
that
covered
the
very
claim
kate
had
been
making
billy
had
not
thought
of
the
book
for
months
but
she
went
at
once
to
get
it
now
there
might
be
after
all
something
in
it
that
would
help
her
the
coming
of
the
first
billy
found
the
chapter
without
difficulty
and
settled
herself
to
read
her
countenance
alight
with
interest
in
a
surprisingly
short
time
however
a
new
expression
came
to
her
face
and
at
last
a
little
gasp
of
dismay
fell
from
her
lips
she
looked
up
then
with
a
startled
gaze
her
walls
possessed
eyes
and
ears
all
these
past
months
only
to
give
instructions
to
an
unseen
hand
that
it
might
write
what
the
eyes
and
ears
had
learned
for
it
was
such
sentences
as
these
that
the
billy
read
maternity
is
apt
to
work
a
miracle
in
a
woman
life
but
sometimes
it
spells
disaster
so
far
as
domestic
bliss
is
concerned
the
young
mother
wrapped
up
in
the
delights
and
duties
of
motherhood
utterly
forgets
that
she
has
a
husband
she
lives
and
moves
and
has
her
being
in
the
nursery
she
thinks
baby
talks
baby
knows
only
baby
she
refuses
to
dress
up
because
it
is
easier
to
take
care
of
baby
in
a
frowzy
wrapper
she
will
not
go
out
with
her
husband
for
fear
something
might
happen
to
the
baby
she
gives
up
her
music
because
baby
wo
let
her
practice
in
vain
her
husband
tries
to
interest
her
in
his
own
affairs
she
has
neither
eyes
nor
ears
for
him
only
for
baby
now
no
man
enjoys
having
his
nose
put
out
of
joint
even
by
his
own
child
he
loves
his
child
devotedly
and
is
proud
of
him
of
course
but
that
does
not
keep
him
from
wanting
the
society
of
his
wife
occasionally
nor
from
longing
for
her
love
and
sympathetic
interest
it
is
an
admirable
thing
certainly
for
a
woman
to
be
a
devoted
mother
but
maternal
affection
can
be
carried
too
far
husbands
have
some
rights
as
well
as
offspring
and
the
wife
who
neglects
her
husband
for
her
babies
does
so
at
her
peril
home
with
the
wife
eternally
in
the
nursery
is
apt
to
be
a
dull
and
lonely
thing
to
the
average
husband
so
he
starts
out
to
find
amusement
for
himself
and
he
finds
it
then
is
the
time
when
the
new
little
life
that
is
so
precious
and
that
should
have
bound
the
two
more
closely
together
becomes
the
wedge
that
drives
them
billy
did
not
read
any
more
with
a
little
sobbing
cry
she
flung
the
book
back
into
her
desk
and
began
to
pull
off
her
wrapper
her
fingers
shook
already
she
saw
herself
a
monster
a
wicked
destroyer
of
domestic
bliss
with
her
thoughtless
absorption
in
baby
until
he
had
become
that
awful
thing
a
and
bertram
poor
bertram
with
his
broken
arm
she
had
not
played
to
him
nor
sung
to
him
nor
gone
out
with
him
and
when
had
they
had
one
of
their
good
long
talks
about
bertram
work
and
plans
but
it
should
all
be
changed
now
she
would
play
and
sing
and
go
out
with
him
she
would
dress
up
too
he
should
see
no
more
wrappers
she
would
ask
about
his
work
and
seem
interested
she
interested
she
remembered
now
that
just
before
he
was
hurt
he
had
told
her
of
a
new
portrait
and
of
a
new
face
of
a
girl
that
he
had
planned
to
do
lately
he
had
said
nothing
about
these
he
had
seemed
discouraged
and
no
wonder
with
his
broken
arm
but
she
would
change
all
that
he
should
see
and
forthwith
billy
hurried
to
her
closet
to
pick
out
her
prettiest
house
frock
long
before
dinner
billy
was
ready
waiting
in
the
she
had
on
a
pretty
little
blue
silk
gown
that
she
knew
bertram
liked
and
she
watched
very
anxiously
for
bertram
to
come
up
the
steps
she
remembered
now
with
a
pang
that
he
had
long
since
given
up
his
peculiar
ring
but
she
meant
to
meet
him
at
the
door
just
the
same
bertram
however
did
not
come
at
a
quarter
before
six
he
telephoned
that
he
had
met
some
friends
and
would
dine
at
the
club
my
my
how
pretty
we
are
exclaimed
uncle
william
when
they
went
down
to
dinner
together
new
frock
why
no
uncle
william
laughed
billy
a
little
tremulously
seen
it
dozens
of
times
have
i
murmured
the
man
i
do
seem
to
remember
it
too
bad
bertram
is
here
to
see
you
somehow
you
look
unusually
pretty
and
billy
heart
ached
anew
billy
spent
the
evening
practicing
softly
to
be
sure
so
as
not
to
wake
baby
but
as
the
days
passed
billy
discovered
that
it
was
much
easier
to
say
she
would
change
things
than
it
was
really
to
change
them
she
changed
herself
it
is
true
her
clothes
her
habits
her
words
and
her
thoughts
but
it
was
more
difficult
to
change
bertram
in
the
first
place
he
was
there
so
little
she
was
dismayed
when
she
saw
how
very
little
indeed
he
was
at
home
and
she
did
not
like
to
ask
him
outright
to
stay
that
was
not
in
accordance
with
her
plans
besides
the
talk
to
young
wives
said
that
indirect
influence
was
much
to
be
preferred
always
to
direct
persuasion
which
last
indeed
usually
failed
to
produce
results
so
billy
dressed
up
and
practiced
and
talked
of
anything
but
the
baby
and
even
hinted
shamelessly
once
or
twice
that
she
would
like
to
go
to
the
theater
but
all
to
little
avail
true
bertram
brightened
up
for
a
minute
when
he
came
home
and
found
her
in
a
new
or
a
favorite
dress
and
he
told
her
how
pretty
she
looked
he
appeared
to
like
to
have
her
play
to
him
too
even
declaring
once
or
twice
that
it
was
quite
like
old
times
yes
it
was
but
he
never
noticed
her
hints
about
the
theater
and
he
did
not
seem
to
like
to
talk
about
his
work
even
a
little
bit
billy
laid
this
last
fact
to
his
injured
arm
she
decided
that
he
had
become
blue
and
discouraged
and
that
he
needed
cheering
up
especially
about
his
work
so
she
determinedly
and
systematically
set
herself
to
doing
it
she
talked
of
the
fine
work
he
had
done
and
of
the
still
finer
work
he
would
yet
do
when
his
arm
was
well
she
told
him
how
proud
she
was
of
him
and
she
let
him
see
how
dear
his
art
was
to
her
and
how
badly
she
would
feel
if
she
thought
he
had
really
lost
all
his
interest
in
his
work
and
would
never
paint
again
she
questioned
him
about
the
new
portrait
he
was
to
begin
as
soon
as
his
arm
would
let
him
and
she
tried
to
arouse
his
enthusiasm
in
the
picture
he
had
planned
to
show
in
the
march
exhibition
of
the
bohemian
ten
telling
him
that
she
was
sure
his
arm
would
allow
him
to
complete
at
least
one
canvas
to
hang
in
none
of
this
however
did
bertram
appear
in
the
least
interested
the
one
thing
indeed
which
he
seemed
not
to
want
to
talk
about
was
his
work
and
he
responded
to
her
overtures
on
the
subject
with
only
moody
silence
or
else
with
almost
irritable
monosyllables
all
of
which
not
only
grieved
but
surprised
billy
very
much
for
according
to
the
talk
to
young
wives
she
was
doing
exactly
what
the
ideal
sympathetic
wife
should
do
when
february
came
bringing
with
it
no
change
for
the
better
billy
was
thoroughly
frightened
bertram
arm
plainly
was
not
improving
he
was
more
gloomy
and
restless
than
ever
he
seemed
not
to
want
to
stay
at
home
at
all
and
billy
knew
now
for
a
certainty
that
he
was
spending
more
and
more
time
with
bob
seaver
and
the
poor
billy
nowhere
could
she
look
these
days
and
see
happiness
even
the
adored
baby
seemed
at
times
almost
to
give
an
added
pang
had
he
not
become
according
to
the
talk
to
young
wives
that
awful
thing
a
the
annex
too
carried
its
sting
for
where
was
the
need
of
an
overflow
house
for
happiness
now
when
there
was
no
happiness
to
overflow
even
the
little
jade
idol
on
billy
mantel
billy
could
not
bear
to
see
these
days
for
its
once
bland
smile
had
become
a
hideous
grin
demanding
where
now
is
your
heap
plenty
velly
good
luckee
but
before
bertram
billy
still
carried
a
bravely
smiling
face
and
to
him
still
she
talked
earnestly
and
enthusiastically
of
his
work
which
last
as
it
happened
was
the
worst
course
she
could
have
pursued
for
the
one
thing
poor
bertram
wished
to
forget
just
now
was
his
work
chapter
xxviii
conspirators
early
in
february
came
arkwright
appearance
at
the
boston
opera
house
the
first
since
he
had
sung
there
as
a
student
a
few
years
before
he
was
an
immediate
and
an
unquestioned
success
his
portrait
adorned
the
front
page
of
almost
every
boston
newspaper
the
next
morning
and
captious
critics
vied
with
each
other
to
do
him
honor
his
full
history
from
boyhood
up
was
featured
with
special
emphasis
on
his
recent
triumphs
in
new
york
and
foreign
capitals
he
was
interviewed
as
to
his
opinion
on
everything
from
vegetarianism
to
woman
suffrage
and
his
preferences
as
to
pies
and
pastimes
were
given
headline
prominence
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
arkwright
was
a
star
all
arkwright
old
friends
including
billy
bertram
cyril
marie
calderwell
alice
greggory
aunt
hannah
and
tommy
dunn
went
to
hear
him
sing
and
after
the
performance
he
held
a
miniature
reception
with
enough
adulation
to
turn
his
head
completely
around
he
declared
deprecatingly
not
until
the
next
evening
however
did
he
have
an
opportunity
for
what
he
called
a
real
talk
with
any
of
his
friends
then
in
calderwell
room
he
settled
back
in
his
chair
with
a
sigh
of
content
for
a
time
his
own
and
calderwell
affairs
occupied
their
attention
then
after
a
short
pause
the
tenor
asked
abruptly
is
there
anything
wrong
with
the
henshaws
calderwell
calderwell
came
suddenly
erect
in
his
chair
thank
you
i
hoped
you
introduce
that
subject
though
for
that
matter
if
you
had
i
should
yes
there
is
and
i
looking
to
you
old
man
to
get
them
out
of
i
arkwright
sat
erect
now
what
do
you
mean
in
a
way
the
expected
has
happened
though
i
know
now
that
i
really
expect
it
to
happen
in
spite
of
my
prophecies
you
may
remember
i
was
always
skeptical
on
the
subject
of
bertram
settling
down
to
a
domestic
hearthstone
i
insisted
be
the
turn
of
a
girl
head
and
the
curve
of
her
cheek
that
he
wanted
to
arkwright
looked
up
with
a
quick
frown
you
do
mean
that
henshaw
has
been
cad
enough
to
find
another
calderwell
threw
up
his
hand
no
no
not
that
we
have
that
to
deal
with
yet
thank
goodness
there
no
woman
in
it
and
really
when
you
come
right
down
to
it
if
ever
a
fellow
had
an
excuse
to
seek
diversion
bertram
henshaw
has
poor
chap
it
just
this
bertram
broke
his
arm
again
last
yes
so
i
hear
and
i
thought
he
was
looking
he
is
it
a
bad
business
was
improperly
set
in
the
first
place
and
it
not
doing
well
now
in
fact
i
told
on
pretty
good
authority
that
the
doctor
says
he
probably
will
never
use
it
oh
by
george
calderwell
yes
tough
is
it
when
you
think
of
his
work
and
know
as
i
happen
to
that
he
particularly
dependent
on
his
right
hand
for
everything
he
does
tell
this
generally
and
i
understand
billy
and
the
family
know
nothing
of
it
how
hopeless
the
case
is
i
mean
well
naturally
the
poor
fellow
has
been
pretty
thoroughly
discouraged
and
to
get
away
from
himself
he
gone
back
to
his
old
bohemian
habits
spending
much
of
his
time
with
some
of
his
old
cronies
that
are
none
too
good
for
him
seaver
for
bob
seaver
yes
i
know
arkwright
lips
snapped
together
crisply
yes
he
said
he
knew
you
that
why
i
counting
on
your
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
i
want
you
to
get
henshaw
away
from
him
and
keep
him
arkwright
face
darkened
with
an
angry
flush
great
scott
calderwell
what
are
you
talking
about
henshaw
is
no
kid
to
be
toted
home
and
i
no
nursery
governess
to
do
the
toting
calderwell
laughed
quietly
no
i
do
think
any
one
would
take
you
for
a
nursery
governess
arkwright
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
you
are
still
known
to
some
of
your
friends
as
jane
but
you
can
sing
a
song
man
which
will
promptly
give
you
a
through
ticket
to
their
innermost
sacred
circle
in
fact
to
my
certain
knowledge
seaver
is
already
planning
a
jamboree
with
you
at
the
right
hand
of
the
toastmaster
there
your
chance
once
in
stay
in
long
enough
to
get
henshaw
but
good
heavens
calderwell
it
impossible
what
can
i
do
demanded
arkwright
savagely
i
ca
walk
up
to
the
man
take
him
by
the
ear
and
say
you
sir
march
home
neither
can
i
come
the
act
and
hold
up
to
him
the
mirror
of
his
no
but
you
can
get
him
out
of
it
way
you
can
find
a
way
for
billy
there
was
no
answer
and
after
a
moment
calderwell
went
on
more
quietly
i
have
seen
billy
but
two
or
three
times
since
i
came
back
to
boston
but
i
do
need
to
to
know
that
she
breaking
her
heart
over
something
and
of
course
that
something
is
there
was
still
no
answer
arkwright
got
up
suddenly
and
walked
to
the
window
you
see
i
helpless
resumed
calderwell
i
do
paint
pictures
nor
sing
songs
nor
write
stories
nor
dance
jigs
for
a
living
and
you
have
to
do
one
or
another
to
be
in
with
that
set
and
it
got
to
be
a
with
bertram
all
is
something
will
have
to
be
done
to
get
him
out
of
the
state
of
mind
and
body
he
in
now
or
arkwright
wheeled
sharply
when
did
you
say
this
jamboree
was
going
to
be
he
demanded
next
week
some
time
the
date
is
not
settled
they
were
going
to
consult
commented
arkwright
and
though
his
next
remark
was
a
complete
change
of
subject
calderwell
gave
a
contented
sigh
if
when
the
proposition
was
first
made
to
him
arkwright
was
doubtful
of
his
ability
to
be
a
successful
he
was
even
more
doubtful
of
it
as
the
days
passed
and
he
was
attempting
to
carry
out
the
suggestion
he
had
known
that
he
was
undertaking
a
most
difficult
and
delicate
task
and
he
soon
began
to
fear
that
it
was
an
impossible
one
as
well
with
a
dogged
persistence
however
he
adhered
to
his
purpose
ever
on
the
alert
to
be
more
watchful
more
tactful
more
efficient
in
emergencies
disagreeable
as
was
the
task
in
a
way
in
another
way
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
him
he
was
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
do
anything
for
billy
and
then
too
he
was
glad
of
something
absorbing
enough
to
take
his
mind
off
his
own
affairs
he
told
himself
sometimes
that
this
helping
another
man
to
fight
his
tiger
skin
was
assisting
himself
to
fight
his
own
arkwright
was
trying
very
hard
not
to
think
of
alice
greggory
these
days
he
had
come
back
hoping
that
he
was
in
a
measure
cured
of
his
folly
as
he
termed
it
but
the
first
look
into
alice
eyes
had
taught
him
the
fallacy
of
that
idea
in
that
very
first
meeting
with
alice
he
feared
that
he
had
revealed
his
secret
for
she
was
plainly
so
nervously
distant
and
ill
at
ease
with
him
that
he
could
but
construe
her
embarrassment
and
chilly
dignity
as
pity
for
him
and
a
desire
to
show
him
that
she
had
nothing
but
friendship
for
him
since
then
he
had
seen
but
little
of
her
partly
because
he
did
not
wish
to
see
her
and
partly
because
his
time
was
so
fully
occupied
then
too
in
a
way
he
had
heard
a
rumor
that
calderwell
was
engaged
to
be
married
and
though
no
feminine
name
had
been
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
story
arkwright
had
not
hesitated
to
supply
in
his
own
mind
that
of
alice
greggory
beginning
with
the
jamboree
which
came
off
quite
in
accordance
with
calderwell
prophecies
arkwright
spent
the
most
of
such
time
as
was
not
given
to
his
professional
duties
in
deliberately
cultivating
the
society
of
bertram
and
his
friends
to
this
extent
he
met
with
no
difficulty
for
he
found
that
arkwright
the
new
star
in
the
operatic
firmament
was
obviously
a
welcome
comrade
beyond
this
it
was
not
so
easy
arkwright
wondered
indeed
sometimes
if
he
were
making
any
progress
at
all
but
still
he
persevered
he
walked
with
bertram
he
talked
with
bertram
unobtrusively
he
contrived
to
be
near
bertram
almost
always
when
they
were
together
with
the
gradually
he
won
from
him
the
story
of
what
the
surgeon
had
said
to
him
and
of
how
black
the
future
looked
in
consequence
this
established
a
new
bond
between
them
so
potent
that
arkwright
ventured
to
test
it
one
day
by
telling
bertram
the
story
of
the
tiger
skin
the
first
tiger
skin
in
his
uncle
library
years
ago
and
of
how
since
then
any
difficulty
he
had
encountered
he
had
tried
to
treat
as
a
tiger
skin
in
telling
the
story
he
was
careful
to
draw
no
moral
for
his
listener
and
to
preach
no
sermon
he
told
the
tale
too
with
all
possible
whimsical
lightness
of
touch
and
immediately
at
its
conclusion
he
changed
the
subject
but
that
he
had
not
failed
utterly
in
his
design
was
evidenced
a
few
days
later
when
bertram
grimly
declared
that
he
guessed
tiger
skin
was
a
lively
beast
all
right
the
first
time
arkwright
went
home
with
bertram
his
presence
was
almost
a
necessity
bertram
was
not
quite
himself
that
night
billy
admitted
them
she
had
plainly
been
watching
and
waiting
arkwright
never
forgot
the
look
on
her
face
as
her
eyes
met
his
there
was
a
curious
mixture
of
terror
hurt
pride
relief
and
shame
overtopped
by
a
fierce
loyalty
which
almost
seemed
to
say
aloud
the
words
do
you
dare
to
blame
him
arkwright
heart
ached
with
sympathy
and
admiration
at
the
proudly
courageous
way
in
which
billy
carried
off
the
next
few
painful
minutes
even
when
he
bade
her
good
night
a
little
later
only
her
eyes
said
thank
her
lips
were
dumb
arkwright
often
went
home
with
bertram
after
that
not
that
it
was
always
necessary
far
from
it
some
time
indeed
elapsed
before
he
had
quite
the
same
excuse
again
for
his
presence
but
he
had
found
that
occasionally
he
could
get
bertram
home
earlier
by
adroit
suggestions
of
one
kind
or
another
and
more
and
more
frequently
he
was
succeeding
in
getting
him
home
for
a
game
of
chess
bertram
liked
chess
and
was
a
fine
player
since
breaking
his
arm
he
had
turned
to
games
with
the
feverish
eagerness
of
one
who
looks
for
something
absorbing
to
fill
an
unrestful
mind
it
was
seaver
skill
in
chess
that
had
at
first
attracted
bertram
to
the
man
long
ago
but
bertram
could
beat
him
easily
too
easily
for
much
pleasure
in
it
now
so
they
did
not
play
chess
often
these
days
bertram
had
found
that
in
spite
of
his
injury
he
could
still
take
part
in
other
games
and
some
of
them
if
not
so
intricate
as
chess
were
at
least
more
apt
to
take
his
mind
off
himself
especially
if
there
were
a
bit
of
money
up
to
add
zest
and
interest
as
it
happened
however
bertram
learned
one
day
that
arkwright
could
play
chess
and
play
well
too
as
he
discovered
after
their
first
game
together
this
fact
contributed
not
a
little
to
such
success
as
arkwright
was
having
in
his
efforts
to
wean
bertram
from
his
undesirable
companions
for
bertram
soon
found
out
that
arkwright
was
more
than
a
match
for
himself
and
the
occasional
games
he
did
succeed
in
winning
only
whetted
his
appetite
for
more
many
an
evening
now
therefore
was
spent
by
the
two
men
in
bertram
den
with
billy
anxiously
hovering
near
her
eyes
longingly
watching
either
her
husband
absorbed
face
or
the
pretty
little
red
and
white
ivory
figures
which
seemed
to
possess
so
wonderful
a
power
to
hold
his
attention
in
spite
of
her
joy
at
the
chessmen
efficacy
in
keeping
bertram
at
home
however
she
was
almost
jealous
of
them
mr
arkwright
could
you
show
how
to
play
sometime
she
said
wistfully
one
evening
when
the
momentary
absence
of
bertram
had
left
the
two
alone
together
i
used
to
watch
bertram
and
marie
play
years
ago
but
i
never
knew
how
to
play
myself
not
that
i
can
see
where
the
fun
is
in
just
sitting
staring
at
a
chessboard
for
half
an
hour
at
a
time
though
but
bertram
likes
it
and
so
i
i
want
to
learn
to
stare
with
him
will
you
teach
me
i
should
be
glad
to
smiled
arkwright
then
will
you
come
maybe
sometimes
when
bertram
is
at
the
doctor
he
goes
every
tuesday
and
friday
at
three
for
treatment
rather
you
came
then
for
two
reasons
first
because
i
do
want
bertram
to
know
i
learning
till
i
can
play
and
secondly
because
because
i
do
want
to
take
you
away
from
the
last
words
were
spoken
very
low
and
were
accompanied
by
a
painful
blush
it
was
the
first
time
billy
had
ever
hinted
to
arkwright
in
words
that
she
understood
what
he
was
trying
to
do
i
come
next
tuesday
promised
arkwright
with
a
cheerfully
unobservant
air
then
bertram
came
in
bringing
the
book
of
chess
problems
for
which
he
had
gone
chapter
xxix
chess
promptly
at
three
tuesday
afternoon
arkwright
appeared
at
the
strata
and
for
the
next
hour
billy
did
her
best
to
learn
the
names
and
the
moves
of
the
pretty
little
ivory
men
but
at
the
end
of
the
hour
she
was
almost
ready
to
give
up
in
despair
if
there
were
so
many
kinds
and
if
they
did
all
insist
on
doing
something
different
it
would
be
so
bad
she
sighed
but
how
can
you
be
expected
to
remember
which
goes
diagonal
and
which
crisscross
and
which
ca
go
but
one
square
and
which
can
skip
across
the
board
when
that
little
can
go
straight
ahead
squares
sometimes
and
the
next
minute
only
one
except
when
it
takes
things
and
then
it
goes
crooked
one
square
and
when
that
tiresome
little
horse
tries
to
go
all
ways
at
once
and
can
jump
and
hurdle
over
head
even
the
king
how
can
you
expect
folks
to
remember
but
then
bertram
remembers
she
added
resolutely
so
i
guess
i
whenever
possible
after
that
arkwright
came
on
tuesdays
and
fridays
and
in
spite
of
her
doubts
billy
did
very
soon
begin
to
spurred
by
her
great
desire
to
play
with
bertram
and
surprise
him
billy
spared
no
pains
to
learn
well
her
lessons
even
among
the
baby
books
and
playthings
these
days
might
be
found
a
manual
of
chess
for
billy
pursued
her
study
at
all
hours
and
some
nights
even
her
dreams
were
of
ruined
castles
where
kings
and
queens
and
bishops
disported
themselves
with
pawns
for
servants
and
where
a
weird
knight
on
horseback
used
the
castle
highest
tower
for
a
hurdle
landing
always
a
hundred
yards
to
one
side
of
where
he
would
be
expected
to
come
down
it
was
not
long
of
course
before
billy
could
play
a
game
of
chess
after
a
fashion
but
she
knew
just
enough
to
realize
that
she
actually
knew
nothing
and
she
knew
too
that
until
she
could
play
a
really
good
game
her
moves
would
not
hold
bertram
attention
for
one
minute
not
at
present
therefore
was
she
willing
bertram
should
know
what
she
was
attempting
to
do
billy
had
not
yet
learned
what
the
great
surgeon
had
said
to
bertram
she
knew
only
that
his
arm
was
no
better
and
that
he
never
voluntarily
spoke
of
his
painting
over
her
now
seemed
to
be
hanging
a
vague
horror
something
was
the
matter
she
knew
that
but
what
it
was
she
could
not
fathom
she
realized
that
arkwright
was
trying
to
help
and
her
gratitude
though
silent
knew
no
bounds
not
even
to
aunt
hannah
or
uncle
william
could
she
speak
of
this
thing
that
was
troubling
her
that
they
too
understood
in
a
measure
she
realized
but
still
she
said
no
word
billy
was
wearing
a
proud
little
air
of
aloofness
these
days
that
was
to
those
who
saw
it
and
read
it
aright
for
what
it
was
loyalty
to
bertram
no
matter
what
happened
and
so
billy
pored
over
her
chessboard
feverishly
tirelessly
having
ever
before
her
longing
eyes
the
dear
time
when
bertram
across
the
table
from
her
should
sit
happily
staring
for
half
an
hour
at
a
move
she
had
made
whatever
billy
was
to
signify
however
in
her
own
life
it
was
destined
to
play
a
part
in
the
lives
of
two
friends
of
hers
that
was
most
unexpected
during
billy
very
first
lesson
as
it
chanced
alice
greggory
called
and
found
billy
and
arkwright
so
absorbed
in
their
game
that
they
did
not
at
first
hear
eliza
speak
her
name
the
quick
color
that
flew
to
arkwright
face
at
sight
of
herself
was
construed
at
once
by
alice
as
embarrassment
on
his
part
at
being
found
with
bertram
henshaw
wife
and
she
did
not
like
it
she
was
not
pleased
that
he
was
there
she
was
less
pleased
that
he
blushed
for
being
there
it
so
happened
that
alice
found
him
there
again
several
times
alice
gave
a
piano
lesson
at
two
every
tuesday
and
friday
afternoon
to
a
little
beacon
street
neighbor
of
billy
and
she
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
stepping
in
to
see
billy
for
a
few
minutes
afterward
which
brought
her
there
at
a
little
past
three
just
after
the
chess
lesson
was
well
started
if
the
first
time
that
alice
greggory
found
arkwright
opposite
billy
at
the
she
was
surprised
and
displeased
the
second
and
third
times
she
was
much
more
so
when
it
finally
came
to
her
one
day
with
sickening
illumination
that
always
the
were
during
bertram
hour
at
the
doctor
she
was
appalled
what
could
it
mean
had
arkwright
given
up
his
fight
was
he
playing
false
to
himself
and
to
bertram
by
trying
thus
on
the
sly
to
win
the
love
of
his
friend
wife
was
this
man
whom
she
had
so
admired
for
his
brave
stand
and
to
whom
all
unasked
she
had
given
her
heart
best
love
more
the
pity
of
it
was
this
idol
of
hers
to
show
feet
of
clay
after
all
she
could
not
believe
it
and
yet
sick
at
heart
but
imbued
with
the
determination
of
a
righteous
cause
alice
greggory
resolved
for
billy
sake
to
watch
and
wait
if
necessary
she
should
speak
to
some
one
though
to
whom
she
did
not
know
billy
happiness
should
not
be
put
in
jeopardy
if
she
could
help
it
indeed
no
as
the
weeks
passed
alice
came
to
be
more
and
more
uneasy
distressed
and
grieved
of
billy
she
could
believe
no
evil
but
of
arkwright
she
was
beginning
to
think
she
could
believe
everything
that
was
dishonorable
and
despicable
and
to
believe
that
of
the
man
she
still
loved
no
wonder
that
alice
did
not
look
nor
act
like
herself
these
days
incensed
at
herself
because
she
did
love
him
angry
at
him
because
he
seemed
to
be
proving
himself
so
unworthy
of
that
love
and
genuinely
frightened
at
what
she
thought
was
the
wreck
of
all
happiness
for
her
dear
friend
billy
alice
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
at
the
first
she
had
told
herself
confidently
that
she
would
speak
to
but
as
time
passed
she
saw
the
impracticability
of
that
idea
speak
to
somebody
indeed
to
whom
when
where
what
should
she
say
where
was
her
right
to
say
anything
she
was
not
dealing
with
a
parcel
of
naughty
children
who
had
pilfered
the
cake
jar
she
was
dealing
with
grown
men
and
women
who
presumedly
knew
their
own
affairs
and
who
certainly
would
resent
any
interference
from
her
on
the
other
hand
could
she
stand
calmly
by
and
see
bertram
lose
his
wife
arkwright
his
honor
billy
her
happiness
and
herself
her
faith
in
human
nature
all
because
to
do
otherwise
would
be
to
meddle
in
other
business
apparently
she
could
and
should
at
least
that
seemed
to
be
the
rôle
which
she
was
expected
to
play
it
was
when
alice
had
reached
this
unhappy
frame
of
mind
that
arkwright
himself
unexpectedly
opened
the
door
for
her
the
two
were
alone
together
in
bertram
henshaw
den
it
was
tuesday
afternoon
alice
had
called
to
find
billy
and
arkwright
deep
in
their
usual
game
of
chess
then
a
matter
of
domestic
affairs
had
taken
billy
from
the
room
i
afraid
i
have
to
be
gone
ten
minutes
or
more
she
had
said
as
she
rose
from
the
table
reluctantly
but
you
might
be
showing
alice
the
moves
arkwright
she
had
added
with
a
laugh
as
she
disappeared
shall
i
teach
you
the
moves
he
had
smiled
when
they
were
alone
together
alice
reply
had
been
so
indignantly
short
and
sharp
that
arkwright
after
a
moment
pause
had
said
with
a
whimsical
smile
that
yet
carried
a
touch
of
sadness
i
am
forced
to
surmise
from
your
answer
that
you
think
it
is
who
should
be
teaching
moves
at
all
events
i
seem
to
have
been
making
some
moves
lately
that
have
not
suited
you
judging
by
your
actions
have
i
offended
you
in
any
way
alice
the
girl
turned
with
a
quick
lifting
of
her
head
alice
knew
that
if
ever
she
were
to
speak
it
must
be
now
never
again
could
she
hope
for
such
an
opportunity
as
this
suddenly
throwing
circumspect
caution
quite
aside
she
determined
that
she
would
speak
springing
to
her
feet
she
crossed
the
room
and
seated
herself
in
billy
chair
at
the
me
offend
me
she
exclaimed
in
a
low
voice
as
if
i
were
the
one
you
were
offending
why
murmured
the
man
in
obvious
stupefaction
alice
raised
her
hand
palm
outward
now
do
do
pretend
you
do
know
she
begged
almost
piteously
please
do
add
that
to
all
the
rest
oh
i
understand
of
course
it
none
of
my
affairs
and
i
was
going
to
speak
she
choked
but
when
you
gave
me
this
chance
i
had
to
at
first
i
could
believe
it
she
plunged
on
plainly
hurrying
against
return
after
all
you
told
me
of
how
you
meant
to
fight
it
your
tiger
skin
and
i
thought
it
merely
that
you
were
here
alone
with
her
those
days
i
came
then
when
i
found
out
they
were
the
days
henshaw
was
away
at
the
doctor
i
had
to
she
stopped
for
breath
arkwright
who
up
to
this
moment
had
shown
that
he
was
completely
mystified
as
to
what
she
was
talking
about
suddenly
flushed
a
painful
red
he
was
obviously
about
to
speak
but
she
prevented
him
with
a
quick
gesture
there
a
little
more
i
got
to
say
please
as
if
it
were
bad
enough
to
do
what
you
doing
but
you
must
needs
take
it
at
such
a
time
as
this
when
when
her
husband
doing
just
what
he
ought
to
do
and
we
all
know
it
it
so
unfair
to
take
her
now
and
try
to
to
win
and
you
are
even
fair
with
him
she
protested
tremulously
you
pretend
to
be
his
friend
you
go
with
him
everywhere
it
just
as
if
you
were
to
to
pull
him
down
you
one
with
the
whole
the
blood
suddenly
receded
from
face
leaving
it
very
white
but
if
alice
saw
it
she
paid
no
heed
everybody
says
you
are
then
to
come
here
like
this
on
the
sly
when
you
know
he
ca
be
here
i
oh
ca
you
see
what
you
doing
there
was
a
moment
pause
then
arkwright
spoke
a
deep
pain
looked
from
his
eyes
he
was
still
very
pale
and
his
mouth
had
settled
into
sad
lines
i
think
perhaps
it
may
be
just
as
well
if
i
tell
you
what
i
doing
or
rather
trying
to
do
he
said
quietly
then
he
told
her
and
so
you
see
he
added
when
he
had
finished
the
tale
i
really
accomplished
much
after
all
and
it
seems
the
little
i
have
accomplished
has
only
led
to
my
being
misjudged
by
you
my
best
alice
gave
a
sobbing
cry
her
face
was
scarlet
horror
shame
and
relief
struggled
for
mastery
in
her
countenance
oh
but
i
did
know
i
did
know
she
moaned
twisting
her
hands
nervously
and
now
when
you
been
so
brave
so
true
for
me
to
accuse
you
of
oh
can
you
forgive
me
but
you
see
knowing
that
you
care
for
her
it
did
look
she
choked
into
silence
and
turned
away
her
head
he
glanced
at
her
tenderly
mournfully
yes
he
said
after
a
minute
in
a
low
voice
i
can
see
how
it
did
look
and
so
i
going
to
tell
you
now
something
i
had
meant
never
to
tell
you
there
really
could
have
been
anything
in
that
you
see
for
i
found
out
long
ago
that
it
was
gone
whatever
love
there
had
been
for
but
your
tiger
skin
oh
yes
i
thought
it
was
alive
smiled
arkwright
sadly
when
i
asked
you
to
help
me
fight
it
but
one
day
very
suddenly
i
discovered
that
it
was
nothing
but
a
dead
skin
of
dreams
and
memories
but
i
made
another
discovery
too
i
found
that
just
beyond
lay
another
one
and
that
was
very
much
another
one
alice
turned
to
him
in
wonder
but
you
never
asked
me
to
help
you
fight
that
one
he
shook
his
head
no
i
could
you
see
you
could
have
helped
me
you
only
have
hindered
hindered
you
yes
you
see
it
was
my
love
for
you
that
i
was
fighting
alice
gave
a
low
cry
and
flushed
vividly
but
arkwright
hurried
on
his
eyes
turned
away
oh
i
understand
i
know
i
not
asking
for
anything
i
heard
some
time
ago
of
your
engagement
to
calderwell
i
tried
many
times
to
say
the
proper
expected
pretty
speeches
but
i
could
i
will
now
though
i
do
you
have
all
my
tenderest
best
wishes
for
your
happiness
dear
if
long
ago
i
had
been
such
a
blind
fool
as
not
to
know
my
own
heart
but
but
there
some
mistake
interposed
alice
palpitatingly
with
hanging
head
i
i
not
engaged
to
arkwright
turned
and
sent
a
keen
glance
into
her
face
you
not
but
i
heard
that
calderwell
he
stopped
helplessly
you
heard
that
calderwell
was
engaged
very
likely
but
it
so
happens
he
is
engaged
to
me
murmured
alice
faintly
but
long
ago
you
said
arkwright
paused
his
eyes
still
keenly
searching
her
face
never
mind
what
i
said
long
ago
laughed
alice
trying
unsuccessfully
to
meet
his
gaze
one
says
lots
of
things
at
times
you
into
arkwright
eyes
came
a
new
light
a
light
that
plainly
needed
but
a
breath
to
fan
it
into
quick
fire
alice
he
said
softly
do
you
mean
that
maybe
now
i
need
try
to
fight
that
other
tiger
skin
there
was
no
answer
arkwright
reached
out
a
pleading
hand
alice
dear
i
loved
you
so
long
he
begged
unsteadily
you
think
that
sometime
if
i
was
very
very
patient
you
could
just
to
care
a
little
for
me
still
there
was
no
answer
then
slowly
alice
shook
her
head
her
face
was
turned
quite
away
which
was
a
pity
for
if
arkwright
could
have
seen
the
sudden
tender
mischief
in
her
eyes
his
own
would
not
have
become
so
somber
not
even
a
little
bit
i
could
ever
begin
answered
a
voice
alice
cried
the
man
alice
turned
now
and
for
a
fleeting
instant
let
him
see
her
eyes
glowing
with
the
love
so
long
kept
in
relentless
exile
i
could
because
you
began
long
ago
she
whispered
alice
it
was
the
same
single
word
but
spoken
with
a
world
of
difference
for
into
it
now
was
crowded
all
the
glory
and
the
wonder
of
a
great
love
alice
breathed
the
man
again
and
this
time
the
word
was
oh
so
tenderly
whispered
into
the
little
pink
and
white
ear
of
the
girl
in
his
arms
i
got
delayed
began
billy
in
the
doorway
she
broke
off
beating
a
hushed
but
precipitate
retreat
fully
thirty
minutes
later
billy
came
to
the
door
again
this
time
her
approach
was
heralded
by
a
snatch
of
song
i
hope
you
excuse
my
being
gone
so
long
she
smiled
as
she
entered
the
room
where
her
two
guests
sat
decorously
face
to
face
at
the
well
you
know
you
said
you
be
gone
ten
minutes
arkwright
reminded
her
politely
yes
i
know
i
and
billy
to
her
credit
did
not
even
smile
at
the
man
who
did
not
know
ten
minutes
from
fifty
chapter
xxx
by
a
baby
hand
after
all
it
was
the
baby
hand
that
did
it
as
was
proper
and
perhaps
to
be
expected
for
surely
was
it
not
bertram
place
to
show
his
parents
that
he
was
indeed
no
wedge
but
a
dear
and
precious
tie
binding
two
loving
loyal
hearts
more
and
more
closely
together
it
would
seem
indeed
that
bertram
thought
so
perhaps
and
very
bravely
he
set
about
it
though
to
carry
out
his
purpose
he
had
to
turn
his
steps
into
an
unfamiliar
way
a
way
of
pain
and
weariness
and
danger
it
was
arkwright
who
told
bertram
that
the
baby
was
very
sick
and
that
billy
wanted
him
bertram
went
home
at
once
to
find
a
distracted
billy
and
a
twisted
little
creature
who
it
was
almost
impossible
to
believe
was
the
happy
laughing
baby
boy
he
had
left
that
morning
for
the
next
two
weeks
nothing
was
thought
of
in
the
silent
old
beacon
street
house
but
the
tiny
little
life
hovering
so
near
death
door
that
twice
it
appeared
to
have
slipped
quite
across
the
threshold
all
through
those
terrible
weeks
it
seemed
as
if
billy
neither
ate
nor
slept
and
always
at
her
side
comforting
cheering
and
helping
wherever
possible
was
bertram
tender
loving
and
marvelously
thoughtful
then
came
the
turning
point
when
the
universe
itself
appeared
to
hang
upon
a
baby
breath
gradually
almost
imperceptibly
came
the
fluttering
back
of
the
tiny
spirit
into
the
longing
arms
stretched
so
far
far
out
to
meet
and
hold
it
and
the
father
and
the
mother
looking
into
each
other
sleepless
eyes
knew
that
their
son
was
once
more
theirs
to
love
and
cherish
when
two
have
gone
together
with
a
dear
one
down
into
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
and
have
come
back
either
mourning
or
rejoicing
they
find
a
different
world
from
the
one
they
had
left
things
that
were
great
before
seem
small
and
some
things
that
were
small
seem
great
at
least
bertram
and
billy
found
their
world
thus
changed
when
together
they
came
back
bringing
their
son
with
them
in
the
long
weeks
of
convalescence
when
the
healthy
rosiness
stole
bit
by
bit
into
the
baby
waxen
face
and
the
light
of
recognition
and
understanding
crept
day
by
day
into
the
baby
eyes
there
was
many
a
quiet
hour
for
talks
between
the
two
who
so
anxiously
and
joyously
hailed
every
rosy
tint
and
fleeting
sparkle
and
there
was
so
much
to
tell
so
much
to
hear
so
much
to
talk
about
and
always
running
through
everything
was
that
golden
thread
of
joy
beside
which
all
else
paled
that
they
had
baby
and
each
other
as
if
anything
else
mattered
to
be
sure
there
was
bertram
arm
very
early
in
their
talks
billy
found
out
about
that
but
billy
with
baby
getting
well
was
not
to
be
daunted
even
by
this
nonsense
darling
not
paint
again
indeed
why
bertram
of
course
you
will
she
cried
confidently
but
billy
the
doctor
said
began
bertram
but
billy
would
not
even
listen
very
well
what
if
he
did
dear
she
interrupted
what
if
he
did
say
you
could
use
your
right
arm
much
again
billy
voice
broke
a
little
then
quickly
steadied
into
something
very
much
like
triumph
you
got
your
left
one
bertram
shook
his
head
i
ca
paint
with
yes
you
can
insisted
billy
firmly
why
bertram
what
do
you
suppose
you
were
given
two
arms
for
if
not
to
fight
with
both
of
them
and
i
going
to
be
ever
so
much
prouder
of
what
you
paint
now
because
i
know
how
splendidly
you
worked
to
do
it
besides
there
baby
as
if
you
were
ever
going
to
paint
for
baby
why
bertram
i
going
to
have
you
paint
baby
one
of
these
days
think
how
pleased
he
be
to
see
it
when
he
grows
up
he
nicer
anyhow
than
any
old
of
a
girl
you
ever
did
paint
why
bertram
darling
of
course
you
going
to
paint
and
better
than
you
ever
did
before
bertram
shook
his
head
again
but
this
time
he
smiled
and
patted
billy
cheek
with
the
tip
of
his
forefinger
as
if
i
could
he
disclaimed
but
that
afternoon
he
went
into
his
studio
and
hunted
up
his
last
unfinished
picture
for
some
time
he
stood
motionless
before
it
then
with
a
quick
gesture
of
determination
he
got
out
his
palette
paints
and
brushes
this
time
not
until
he
had
painted
ten
a
dozen
a
score
of
strokes
did
he
drop
his
brush
with
a
sigh
and
carefully
erase
the
fresh
paint
on
the
canvas
the
next
day
he
worked
longer
and
this
time
he
allowed
a
little
a
very
little
of
what
he
had
done
to
remain
the
third
day
billy
herself
found
him
at
his
easel
i
wonder
do
you
suppose
i
could
he
asked
fearfully
why
dearest
of
course
you
can
have
you
noticed
ca
you
see
how
much
more
you
can
do
with
your
left
hand
now
you
to
use
it
you
see
seen
you
do
a
lot
of
things
with
it
lately
that
you
never
used
to
do
at
all
and
of
course
the
more
you
do
with
it
the
more
you
can
i
know
but
that
does
mean
that
i
can
paint
with
it
sighed
bertram
ruefully
eyeing
the
tiny
bit
of
fresh
color
his
canvas
showed
for
his
long
afternoon
work
you
wait
and
see
nodded
billy
with
so
overwhelming
a
cheery
confidence
that
bertram
looking
into
her
glowing
face
was
conscious
of
a
curious
throb
of
exultation
almost
as
if
already
the
victory
were
his
but
it
was
not
always
of
bertram
broken
arm
nor
even
of
his
work
that
they
talked
bertram
hanging
over
the
baby
crib
to
assure
himself
that
the
rosiness
and
the
sparkle
were
really
growing
more
apparent
every
day
used
to
wonder
sometimes
how
ever
in
the
world
he
could
have
been
jealous
of
his
son
he
said
as
much
one
day
to
billy
to
billy
it
was
a
most
astounding
idea
you
mean
you
were
actually
jealous
of
your
own
baby
she
gasped
why
bertram
how
could
and
was
that
why
you
you
sought
distraction
and
oh
but
bertram
that
was
all
my
she
quavered
remorsefully
i
would
play
nor
sing
nor
go
to
walk
nor
anything
and
i
wore
horrid
frowzy
wrappers
all
the
time
and
oh
come
come
billy
expostulated
the
man
i
not
going
to
have
you
talk
like
that
about
wife
but
i
did
the
book
said
i
did
wailed
billy
the
book
good
heavens
are
there
any
books
in
this
too
demanded
bertram
yes
the
same
one
the
the
to
young
wives
nodded
billy
and
then
because
some
things
had
grown
small
to
them
and
some
others
great
they
both
laughed
happily
but
even
this
was
not
quite
all
for
one
evening
very
shyly
billy
brought
out
the
chessboard
of
course
i
ca
play
well
she
faltered
and
maybe
you
do
want
to
play
with
me
at
but
bertram
when
he
found
out
why
she
had
learned
was
very
sure
he
did
want
very
much
to
play
with
her
billy
did
not
beat
of
course
but
she
did
several
times
experience
for
a
few
blissful
minutes
the
pleasure
of
seeing
bertram
sit
motionless
studying
the
board
because
of
a
move
she
had
made
and
though
in
the
end
her
king
was
ignominiously
trapped
with
not
an
unguarded
square
upon
which
to
set
his
poor
distracted
foot
the
memory
of
those
blissful
minutes
when
she
had
made
bertram
stare
more
than
paid
for
the
final
checkmate
by
the
middle
of
june
the
baby
was
well
enough
to
be
taken
to
the
beach
and
bertram
was
so
fortunate
as
to
secure
the
same
house
they
had
occupied
before
once
again
william
went
down
in
maine
for
his
fishing
trip
and
the
strata
was
closed
in
the
beach
house
bertram
was
painting
industriously
with
his
left
hand
almost
he
was
beginning
to
feel
billy
enthusiasm
almost
he
was
believing
that
he
doing
good
work
it
was
not
the
face
of
a
girl
now
it
was
the
face
of
a
baby
smiling
laughing
even
crying
sometimes
at
other
times
just
gazing
straight
into
your
eyes
with
adorable
soberness
bertram
still
went
into
boston
twice
a
week
for
treatment
though
the
treatment
itself
had
changed
the
great
surgeon
had
sent
him
to
still
another
specialist
there
a
chance
though
perhaps
a
small
one
he
had
said
i
like
you
to
try
it
as
the
summer
advanced
bertram
thought
sometimes
that
he
could
see
a
slight
improvement
in
his
injured
arm
but
he
tried
not
to
think
too
much
about
this
he
had
thought
the
same
thing
before
only
to
be
disappointed
in
the
end
besides
he
was
undeniably
interested
just
now
in
seeing
if
he
paint
with
his
left
hand
billy
was
so
sure
and
she
had
said
that
she
would
be
prouder
than
ever
of
him
if
he
could
and
he
would
like
to
make
billy
proud
then
too
there
was
the
baby
he
had
no
idea
a
baby
could
be
so
interesting
to
paint
he
was
not
sure
but
that
he
was
going
to
like
to
paint
babies
even
better
than
he
had
liked
to
paint
his
face
of
a
girl
that
had
brought
him
his
first
fame
in
september
the
family
returned
to
the
strata
the
move
was
made
a
little
earlier
this
year
on
account
of
alice
greggory
wedding
alice
was
to
be
married
in
the
pretty
at
the
annex
just
where
billy
herself
had
been
married
a
few
short
years
before
and
billy
had
great
plans
for
the
wedding
not
all
of
which
she
was
able
to
carry
out
for
alice
like
marie
before
her
had
very
strong
objections
to
being
placed
under
too
great
obligations
and
you
see
really
anyway
she
told
billy
i
owe
the
whole
thing
to
you
to
begin
with
even
my
nonsense
of
course
you
do
disputed
billy
but
i
do
if
it
had
been
for
you
i
should
never
have
found
him
again
and
of
i
should
have
had
this
dear
little
home
to
be
married
in
and
i
never
could
have
left
mother
if
she
had
had
aunt
hannah
and
the
annex
which
means
you
and
if
i
had
found
arkwright
i
might
never
have
known
how
how
i
could
go
back
to
my
old
home
as
i
am
going
on
my
honeymoon
trip
and
just
know
that
every
one
of
my
old
friends
who
shakes
hands
with
me
is
pitying
me
now
because
i
my
father
daughter
and
that
means
you
for
you
see
i
never
would
have
known
that
my
father
name
was
cleared
if
it
had
been
for
you
and
oh
alice
please
please
begged
billy
laughingly
raising
two
protesting
hands
why
do
you
say
that
it
to
me
you
owe
just
breathing
and
be
done
with
it
well
i
will
then
avowed
alice
doggedly
and
it
true
too
for
honestly
my
dear
i
do
believe
i
would
have
been
breathing
nor
mother
either
if
you
had
found
us
that
morning
and
taken
us
out
of
those
awful
i
never
you
would
let
me
take
you
out
laughed
billy
you
proud
little
thing
maybe
forgotten
how
you
turned
poor
uncle
william
and
me
out
into
the
cold
cold
world
that
morning
just
because
we
dared
to
aspire
to
your
lowestoft
teapot
but
i
have
oh
billy
please
begged
alice
the
painful
color
staining
her
face
if
you
knew
how
i
hated
myself
since
for
the
way
i
acted
that
day
and
really
you
did
take
us
away
from
there
you
no
i
did
i
merely
found
two
good
tenants
for
and
delano
corrected
billy
with
a
sober
face
oh
yes
i
know
all
about
that
smiled
alice
affectionately
and
you
got
mother
and
me
here
to
keep
aunt
hannah
company
and
teach
tommy
dunn
and
you
got
aunt
hannah
here
to
keep
us
company
and
take
care
of
tommy
dunn
and
you
got
tommy
dunn
here
so
aunt
hannah
and
we
could
have
somebody
to
teach
and
take
care
of
and
as
for
the
others
but
billy
put
her
hands
to
her
ears
and
fled
the
wedding
was
to
be
on
the
fifteenth
from
the
west
kate
wrote
that
of
course
it
was
none
of
her
affairs
particularly
as
neither
of
the
interested
parties
was
a
relation
but
still
she
should
think
that
for
a
man
in
arkwright
position
nothing
but
a
church
wedding
would
do
at
all
as
of
course
he
did
in
a
way
belong
to
the
public
alice
however
declared
that
perhaps
he
did
belong
to
the
public
when
he
was
don
in
doublet
and
hose
but
when
he
was
just
plain
michael
jeremiah
arkwright
in
a
frock
coat
he
was
hers
and
she
did
not
propose
to
make
a
grand
opera
show
of
her
wedding
and
as
arkwright
too
very
much
disapproved
of
the
idea
the
two
were
married
in
the
annex
at
noon
on
the
fifteenth
as
originally
planned
in
spite
of
kate
hartwell
letter
it
was
soon
after
the
wedding
that
bertram
told
billy
he
wished
she
would
sit
for
him
with
bertram
i
want
to
try
my
hand
at
you
both
together
he
coaxed
why
of
course
if
you
like
dear
agreed
billy
promptly
though
i
think
baby
is
just
as
nice
and
even
nicer
once
again
all
over
bertram
studio
began
to
appear
sketches
of
billy
this
time
a
glorified
tender
billy
with
the
wonderful
in
her
eyes
then
after
several
sketches
of
trial
poses
bertram
began
his
picture
of
billy
and
the
baby
together
even
now
bertram
was
not
sure
of
his
work
he
knew
that
he
could
not
yet
paint
with
his
old
freedom
and
ease
he
knew
that
his
stroke
was
not
so
sure
so
untrammeled
but
he
knew
too
that
he
had
gained
wonderfully
during
the
summer
and
that
he
was
gaining
now
every
day
to
billy
he
said
nothing
of
all
this
even
to
himself
he
scarcely
put
his
hope
into
words
but
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
what
he
was
really
painting
his
mother
and
child
picture
for
was
the
bohemian
ten
club
exhibition
in
march
if
he
could
but
put
upon
canvas
the
vision
that
was
spurring
him
on
and
so
bertram
worked
all
through
those
short
winter
days
not
always
upon
the
one
picture
of
course
but
upon
some
picture
or
sketch
that
would
help
to
give
his
still
uncertain
left
hand
the
skill
that
had
belonged
to
its
mate
and
always
cheering
encouraging
insisting
on
victory
was
billy
so
that
even
had
bertram
been
tempted
sometimes
to
give
up
he
could
not
have
done
so
and
faced
billy
grieved
disappointed
eyes
and
when
at
last
his
work
was
completed
and
the
pictured
mother
and
child
in
all
their
marvelous
life
and
beauty
seemed
ready
to
step
from
the
canvas
billy
drew
a
long
ecstatic
breath
oh
bertram
it
it
is
the
best
work
you
have
ever
billy
was
looking
at
the
baby
always
she
had
ignored
herself
as
part
of
the
picture
and
wo
it
be
fine
for
the
exhibition
bertram
hand
tightened
on
the
in
front
of
him
for
a
moment
he
could
not
speak
then
a
bit
huskily
he
asked
would
you
dare
risk
it
risk
it
why
bertram
henshaw
i
meant
that
picture
for
the
exhibition
from
the
very
first
only
i
never
dreamed
you
could
get
it
so
perfectly
lovely
what
do
you
say
about
baby
being
nicer
than
any
old
of
a
girl
that
you
ever
did
she
triumphed
and
bertram
who
even
to
himself
had
not
dared
whisper
the
word
exhibition
gave
a
tremulous
laugh
that
was
almost
a
sob
so
overwhelming
was
his
sudden
realization
of
what
faith
and
confidence
had
meant
to
billy
his
wife
if
there
was
still
a
lingering
doubt
in
bertram
mind
it
must
have
been
dispelled
in
less
than
an
hour
after
the
bohemian
ten
club
exhibition
flung
open
its
doors
on
its
opening
night
once
again
bertram
found
his
picture
the
cynosure
of
all
admiring
eyes
and
himself
the
center
of
an
enthusiastic
group
of
friends
and
who
vied
with
each
other
in
hearty
words
of
congratulation
and
when
later
the
feared
critics
whose
names
and
opinions
counted
for
so
much
in
his
world
had
their
say
in
the
daily
press
and
weekly
reviews
bertram
knew
how
surely
indeed
he
had
won
and
when
he
read
that
work
shows
now
a
peculiar
strength
a
sort
of
reserve
power
as
it
were
which
beautiful
as
was
his
former
work
it
never
showed
before
he
smiled
grimly
and
said
to
billy
i
suppose
now
that
was
the
fighting
i
did
with
my
good
left
hand
eh
dear
but
there
was
yet
one
more
drop
that
was
to
make
bertram
cup
of
joy
brim
to
overflowing
it
came
just
one
month
after
the
exhibition
in
the
shape
of
a
terse
dozen
words
from
the
doctor
bertram
fairly
flew
home
that
day
he
had
no
consciousness
of
any
means
of
locomotion
he
thought
he
was
going
to
tell
his
wife
at
once
his
great
good
news
but
when
he
saw
her
speech
suddenly
fled
and
all
that
he
could
do
was
to
draw
her
closely
to
him
with
his
left
arm
and
hide
his
face
why
bertram
dearest
what
what
is
it
stammered
the
thoroughly
frightened
billy
has
no
no
yes
yes
everything
has
happened
i
mean
it
going
to
happen
choked
the
man
billy
that
old
chap
says
that
i
going
to
have
my
arm
again
think
of
it
my
good
right
arm
that
i
lost
so
long
bertram
breathed
billy
and
she
too
fell
to
sobbing
later
when
speech
was
more
coherent
she
faltered
well
anyway
it
does
make
any
difference
many
beautiful
pictures
you
after
this
bertram
i
be
prouder
of
any
than
i
am
of
the
one
your
l
left
hand
oh
but
i
have
you
to
thank
for
all
that
no
you
have
disputed
billy
blinking
teary
eyes
but
she
paused
then
went
on
spiritedly
but
anyhow
i
i
do
believe
any
one
not
even
kate
can
say
that
that
i
been
a
hindrance
to
you
in
your
hindrance
scoffed
bertram
in
a
tone
that
left
no
room
for
doubt
and
with
a
kiss
that
left
even
less
if
possible
billy
for
still
another
minute
was
silent
then
with
a
wistfulness
that
was
half
playful
half
serious
she
sighed
bertram
i
believe
being
married
is
something
like
clocks
you
know
at
the
clocks
dear
yes
i
was
out
to
aunt
hannah
she
was
fussing
with
her
clock
the
one
that
strikes
half
an
hour
ahead
and
i
saw
all
those
quantities
of
wheels
little
and
big
that
have
to
go
just
so
with
all
the
little
cogs
fitting
into
all
the
other
little
cogs
just
exactly
right
well
that
like
marriage
see
there
such
a
lot
of
little
cogs
in
everyday
life
that
have
to
be
fitted
so
they
run
smoothly
that
have
to
be
adjusted
at
the
oh
billy
what
an
idea
but
it
so
really
bertram
anyhow
i
know
my
cogs
were
always
getting
out
of
place
at
the
first
laughed
billy
and
i
was
like
aunt
hannah
clock
too
always
going
off
half
an
hour
ahead
of
time
and
maybe
i
shall
be
so
again
sometimes
but
bertram
her
voice
shook
a
little
if
you
just
look
at
my
face
you
see
that
i
tell
the
right
time
there
just
as
aunt
hannah
clock
does
i
sure
always
tell
the
right
time
there
even
if
i
do
go
off
half
an
hour
ahead
as
if
i
did
know
that
answered
bertram
very
low
and
tenderly
besides
i
reckon
i
have
some
cogs
of
my
own
that
need
adjusting
