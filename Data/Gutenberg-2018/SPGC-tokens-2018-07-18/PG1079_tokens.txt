the
life
and
opinions
of
tristram
shandy
gentleman
by
laurence
sterne
two
lines
in
greek
to
the
right
honourable
pitt
sir
never
poor
wight
of
a
dedicator
had
less
hopes
from
his
dedication
than
i
have
from
this
of
mine
for
it
is
written
in
a
bye
corner
of
the
kingdom
and
in
a
retir
thatch
house
where
i
live
in
a
constant
endeavour
to
fence
against
the
infirmities
of
ill
health
and
other
evils
of
life
by
mirth
being
firmly
persuaded
that
every
time
a
man
smiles
but
much
more
so
when
he
laughs
it
adds
something
to
this
fragment
of
life
i
humbly
beg
sir
that
you
will
honour
this
book
by
taking
it
not
under
your
protection
it
must
protect
itself
but
into
the
country
with
you
where
if
i
am
ever
told
it
has
made
you
smile
or
can
conceive
it
has
beguiled
you
of
one
moment
pain
i
shall
think
myself
as
happy
as
a
minister
of
state
perhaps
much
happier
than
any
one
one
only
excepted
that
i
have
read
or
heard
of
i
am
great
sir
and
what
is
more
to
your
honour
i
am
good
sir
your
and
most
humble
the
author
the
life
and
opinions
of
tristram
shandy
volume
the
first
chapter
i
wish
either
my
father
or
my
mother
or
indeed
both
of
them
as
they
were
in
duty
both
equally
bound
to
it
had
minded
what
they
were
about
when
they
begot
me
had
they
duly
consider
how
much
depended
upon
what
they
were
then
doing
that
not
only
the
production
of
a
rational
being
was
concerned
in
it
but
that
possibly
the
happy
formation
and
temperature
of
his
body
perhaps
his
genius
and
the
very
cast
of
his
mind
and
for
aught
they
knew
to
the
contrary
even
the
fortunes
of
his
whole
house
might
take
their
turn
from
the
humours
and
dispositions
which
were
then
uppermost
had
they
duly
weighed
and
considered
all
this
and
proceeded
accordingly
i
am
verily
persuaded
i
should
have
made
a
quite
different
figure
in
the
world
from
that
in
which
the
reader
is
likely
to
see
believe
me
good
folks
this
is
not
so
inconsiderable
a
thing
as
many
of
you
may
think
it
you
have
all
i
dare
say
heard
of
the
animal
spirits
as
how
they
are
transfused
from
father
to
son
and
a
great
deal
to
that
purpose
well
you
may
take
my
word
that
nine
parts
in
ten
of
a
man
sense
or
his
nonsense
his
successes
and
miscarriages
in
this
world
depend
upon
their
motions
and
activity
and
the
different
tracks
and
trains
you
put
them
into
so
that
when
they
are
once
set
whether
right
or
wrong
is
not
a
matter
away
they
go
cluttering
like
mad
and
by
treading
the
same
steps
over
and
over
again
they
presently
make
a
road
of
it
as
plain
and
as
smooth
as
a
which
when
they
are
once
used
to
the
devil
himself
sometimes
shall
not
be
able
to
drive
them
off
it
pray
my
dear
quoth
my
mother
have
you
not
forgot
to
wind
up
the
clock
good
cried
my
father
making
an
exclamation
but
taking
care
to
moderate
his
voice
at
the
same
time
did
ever
woman
since
the
creation
of
the
world
interrupt
a
man
with
such
a
silly
question
pray
what
was
your
father
saying
nothing
chapter
then
positively
there
is
nothing
in
the
question
that
i
can
see
either
good
or
then
let
me
tell
you
sir
it
was
a
very
unseasonable
question
at
least
because
it
scattered
and
dispersed
the
animal
spirits
whose
business
it
was
to
have
escorted
and
gone
hand
in
hand
with
the
homunculus
and
conducted
him
safe
to
the
place
destined
for
his
reception
the
homunculus
sir
in
however
low
and
ludicrous
a
light
he
may
appear
in
this
age
of
levity
to
the
eye
of
folly
or
prejudice
to
the
eye
of
reason
in
scientific
research
he
stands
confess
a
being
guarded
and
circumscribed
with
the
minutest
philosophers
who
by
the
bye
have
the
most
enlarged
understandings
their
souls
being
inversely
as
their
enquiries
shew
us
incontestably
that
the
homunculus
is
created
by
the
same
hand
engender
in
the
same
course
of
nature
with
the
same
powers
and
faculties
with
us
that
he
consists
as
we
do
of
skin
hair
fat
flesh
veins
arteries
ligaments
nerves
cartilages
bones
marrow
brains
glands
genitals
humours
and
articulations
is
a
being
of
as
much
activity
and
in
all
senses
of
the
word
as
much
and
as
truly
our
as
my
lord
chancellor
of
he
may
be
benefitted
he
may
be
injured
he
may
obtain
redress
in
a
word
he
has
all
the
claims
and
rights
of
humanity
which
tully
puffendorf
or
the
best
ethick
writers
allow
to
arise
out
of
that
state
and
relation
now
dear
sir
what
if
any
accident
had
befallen
him
in
his
way
alone
or
that
through
terror
of
it
natural
to
so
young
a
traveller
my
little
gentleman
had
got
to
his
journey
end
miserably
spent
his
muscular
strength
and
virility
worn
down
to
a
thread
his
own
animal
spirits
ruffled
beyond
description
and
that
in
this
sad
state
of
nerves
he
had
lain
down
a
prey
to
sudden
starts
or
a
series
of
melancholy
dreams
and
fancies
for
nine
long
long
months
i
tremble
to
think
what
a
foundation
had
been
laid
for
a
thousand
weaknesses
both
of
body
and
mind
which
no
skill
of
the
physician
or
the
philosopher
could
ever
afterwards
have
set
thoroughly
to
rights
chapter
to
my
uncle
toby
shandy
do
i
stand
indebted
for
the
preceding
anecdote
to
whom
my
father
who
was
an
excellent
natural
philosopher
and
much
given
to
close
reasoning
upon
the
smallest
matters
had
oft
and
heavily
complained
of
the
injury
but
once
more
particularly
as
my
uncle
toby
well
remember
upon
his
observing
a
most
unaccountable
obliquity
as
he
call
it
in
my
manner
of
setting
up
my
top
and
justifying
the
principles
upon
which
i
had
done
it
the
old
gentleman
shook
his
head
and
in
a
tone
more
expressive
by
half
of
sorrow
than
reproach
he
said
his
heart
all
along
foreboded
and
he
saw
it
verified
in
this
and
from
a
thousand
other
observations
he
had
made
upon
me
that
i
should
neither
think
nor
act
like
any
other
man
child
but
alas
continued
he
shaking
his
head
a
second
time
and
wiping
away
a
tear
which
was
trickling
down
his
cheeks
my
tristram
misfortunes
began
nine
months
before
ever
he
came
into
the
world
my
mother
who
was
sitting
by
look
up
but
she
knew
no
more
than
her
backside
what
my
father
meant
but
my
uncle
toby
shandy
who
had
been
often
informed
of
the
affair
understood
him
very
well
chapter
i
know
there
are
readers
in
the
world
as
well
as
many
other
good
people
in
it
who
are
no
readers
at
all
who
find
themselves
ill
at
ease
unless
they
are
let
into
the
whole
secret
from
first
to
last
of
every
thing
which
concerns
you
it
is
in
pure
compliance
with
this
humour
of
theirs
and
from
a
backwardness
in
my
nature
to
disappoint
any
one
soul
living
that
i
have
been
so
very
particular
already
as
my
life
and
opinions
are
likely
to
make
some
noise
in
the
world
and
if
i
conjecture
right
will
take
in
all
ranks
professions
and
denominations
of
men
whatever
be
no
less
read
than
the
pilgrim
progress
itself
and
in
the
end
prove
the
very
thing
which
montaigne
dreaded
his
essays
should
turn
out
that
is
a
book
for
a
i
find
it
necessary
to
consult
every
one
a
little
in
his
turn
and
therefore
must
beg
pardon
for
going
on
a
little
farther
in
the
same
way
for
which
cause
right
glad
i
am
that
i
have
begun
the
history
of
myself
in
the
way
i
have
done
and
that
i
am
able
to
go
on
tracing
every
thing
in
it
as
horace
says
ab
ovo
horace
i
know
does
not
recommend
this
fashion
altogether
but
that
gentleman
is
speaking
only
of
an
epic
poem
or
a
tragedy
i
forget
which
besides
if
it
was
not
so
i
should
beg
pardon
for
in
writing
what
i
have
set
about
i
shall
confine
myself
neither
to
his
rules
nor
to
any
man
rules
that
ever
lived
to
such
however
as
do
not
choose
to
go
so
far
back
into
these
things
i
can
give
no
better
advice
than
that
they
skip
over
the
remaining
part
of
this
chapter
for
i
declare
is
wrote
only
for
the
curious
and
inquisitive
shut
the
i
was
begot
in
the
night
betwixt
the
first
sunday
and
the
first
monday
in
the
month
of
march
in
the
year
of
our
lord
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
eighteen
i
am
positive
i
but
how
i
came
to
be
so
very
particular
in
my
account
of
a
thing
which
happened
before
i
was
born
is
owing
to
another
small
anecdote
known
only
in
our
own
family
but
now
made
publick
for
the
better
clearing
up
this
point
my
father
you
must
know
who
was
originally
a
turkey
merchant
but
had
left
off
business
for
some
years
in
order
to
retire
to
and
die
upon
his
paternal
estate
in
the
county
of
was
i
believe
one
of
the
most
regular
men
in
every
thing
he
did
whether
was
matter
of
business
or
matter
of
amusement
that
ever
lived
as
a
small
specimen
of
this
extreme
exactness
of
his
to
which
he
was
in
truth
a
slave
he
had
made
it
a
rule
for
many
years
of
his
life
on
the
first
of
every
month
throughout
the
whole
year
as
certain
as
ever
the
came
to
wind
up
a
large
which
we
had
standing
on
the
head
with
his
own
hands
and
being
somewhere
between
fifty
and
sixty
years
of
age
at
the
time
i
have
been
speaking
of
he
had
likewise
gradually
brought
some
other
little
family
concernments
to
the
same
period
in
order
as
he
would
often
say
to
my
uncle
toby
to
get
them
all
out
of
the
way
at
one
time
and
be
no
more
plagued
and
pestered
with
them
the
rest
of
the
month
it
was
attended
but
with
one
misfortune
which
in
a
great
measure
fell
upon
myself
and
the
effects
of
which
i
fear
i
shall
carry
with
me
to
my
grave
namely
that
from
an
unhappy
association
of
ideas
which
have
no
connection
in
nature
it
so
fell
out
at
length
that
my
poor
mother
could
never
hear
the
said
clock
wound
up
but
the
thoughts
of
some
other
things
unavoidably
popped
into
her
head
vice
versa
which
strange
combination
of
ideas
the
sagacious
locke
who
certainly
understood
the
nature
of
these
things
better
than
most
men
affirms
to
have
produced
more
wry
actions
than
all
other
sources
of
prejudice
whatsoever
but
this
by
the
bye
now
it
appears
by
a
memorandum
in
my
father
which
now
lies
upon
the
table
on
which
was
on
the
of
the
same
month
in
which
i
date
my
geniture
my
father
set
upon
his
journey
to
london
with
my
eldest
brother
bobby
to
fix
him
at
westminster
school
and
as
it
appears
from
the
same
authority
he
did
not
get
down
to
his
wife
and
family
till
the
second
week
in
may
following
it
brings
the
thing
almost
to
a
certainty
however
what
follows
in
the
beginning
of
the
next
chapter
puts
it
beyond
all
possibility
of
a
doubt
but
pray
sir
what
was
your
father
doing
all
december
january
and
february
why
madam
he
was
all
that
time
afflicted
with
a
sciatica
chapter
on
the
fifth
day
of
november
which
to
the
aera
fixed
on
was
as
near
nine
kalendar
months
as
any
husband
could
in
reason
have
expected
was
i
tristram
shandy
gentleman
brought
forth
into
this
scurvy
and
disastrous
world
of
i
wish
i
had
been
born
in
the
moon
or
in
any
of
the
planets
except
jupiter
or
saturn
because
i
never
could
bear
cold
weather
for
it
could
not
well
have
fared
worse
with
me
in
any
of
them
though
i
will
not
answer
for
venus
than
it
has
in
this
vile
dirty
planet
of
ours
which
o
my
conscience
with
reverence
be
it
spoken
i
take
to
be
made
up
of
the
shreds
and
clippings
of
the
rest
not
but
the
planet
is
well
enough
provided
a
man
could
be
born
in
it
to
a
great
title
or
to
a
great
estate
or
could
any
how
contrive
to
be
called
up
to
public
charges
and
employments
of
dignity
or
power
but
that
is
not
my
case
and
therefore
every
man
will
speak
of
the
fair
as
his
own
market
has
gone
in
it
for
which
cause
i
affirm
it
over
again
to
be
one
of
the
vilest
worlds
that
ever
was
made
for
i
can
truly
say
that
from
the
first
hour
i
drew
my
breath
in
it
to
this
that
i
can
now
scarce
draw
it
at
all
for
an
asthma
i
got
in
scating
against
the
wind
in
flanders
i
have
been
the
continual
sport
of
what
the
world
calls
fortune
and
though
i
will
not
wrong
her
by
saying
she
has
ever
made
me
feel
the
weight
of
any
great
or
signal
evil
yet
with
all
the
good
temper
in
the
world
i
affirm
it
of
her
that
in
every
stage
of
my
life
and
at
every
turn
and
corner
where
she
could
get
fairly
at
me
the
ungracious
duchess
has
pelted
me
with
a
set
of
as
pitiful
misadventures
and
cross
accidents
as
ever
small
hero
sustained
chapter
in
the
beginning
of
the
last
chapter
i
informed
you
exactly
when
i
was
born
but
i
did
not
inform
you
how
no
that
particular
was
reserved
entirely
for
a
chapter
by
itself
besides
sir
as
you
and
i
are
in
a
manner
perfect
strangers
to
each
other
it
would
not
have
been
proper
to
have
let
you
into
too
many
circumstances
relating
to
myself
all
at
once
you
must
have
a
little
patience
i
have
undertaken
you
see
to
write
not
only
my
life
but
my
opinions
also
hoping
and
expecting
that
your
knowledge
of
my
character
and
of
what
kind
of
a
mortal
i
am
by
the
one
would
give
you
a
better
relish
for
the
other
as
you
proceed
farther
with
me
the
slight
acquaintance
which
is
now
beginning
betwixt
us
will
grow
into
familiarity
and
that
unless
one
of
us
is
in
fault
will
terminate
in
o
diem
praeclarum
then
nothing
which
has
touched
me
will
be
thought
trifling
in
its
nature
or
tedious
in
its
telling
therefore
my
dear
friend
and
companion
if
you
should
think
me
somewhat
sparing
of
my
narrative
on
my
first
setting
out
bear
with
me
and
let
me
go
on
and
tell
my
story
my
own
way
or
if
i
should
seem
now
and
then
to
trifle
upon
the
road
or
should
sometimes
put
on
a
fool
cap
with
a
bell
to
it
for
a
moment
or
two
as
we
pass
along
do
fly
off
but
rather
courteously
give
me
credit
for
a
little
more
wisdom
than
appears
upon
my
outside
and
as
we
jog
on
either
laugh
with
me
or
at
me
or
in
short
do
any
thing
only
keep
your
temper
chapter
in
the
same
village
where
my
father
and
my
mother
dwelt
dwelt
also
a
thin
upright
motherly
notable
good
old
body
of
a
midwife
who
with
the
help
of
a
little
plain
good
sense
and
some
years
full
employment
in
her
business
in
which
she
had
all
along
trusted
little
to
her
own
efforts
and
a
great
deal
to
those
of
dame
nature
had
acquired
in
her
way
no
small
degree
of
reputation
in
the
world
by
which
word
world
need
i
in
this
place
inform
your
worship
that
i
would
be
understood
to
mean
no
more
of
it
than
a
small
circle
described
upon
the
circle
of
the
great
world
of
four
english
miles
diameter
or
thereabouts
of
which
the
cottage
where
the
good
old
woman
lived
is
supposed
to
be
the
centre
she
had
been
left
it
seems
a
widow
in
great
distress
with
three
or
four
small
children
in
her
year
and
as
she
was
at
that
time
a
person
of
decent
carriage
grave
deportment
a
woman
moreover
of
few
words
and
withal
an
object
of
compassion
whose
distress
and
silence
under
it
called
out
the
louder
for
a
friendly
lift
the
wife
of
the
parson
of
the
parish
was
touched
with
pity
and
having
often
lamented
an
inconvenience
to
which
her
husband
flock
had
for
many
years
been
exposed
inasmuch
as
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
midwife
of
any
kind
or
degree
to
be
got
at
let
the
case
have
been
never
so
urgent
within
less
than
six
or
seven
long
miles
riding
which
said
seven
long
miles
in
dark
nights
and
dismal
roads
the
country
thereabouts
being
nothing
but
a
deep
clay
was
almost
equal
to
fourteen
and
that
in
effect
was
sometimes
next
to
having
no
midwife
at
all
it
came
into
her
head
that
it
would
be
doing
as
seasonable
a
kindness
to
the
whole
parish
as
to
the
poor
creature
herself
to
get
her
a
little
instructed
in
some
of
the
plain
principles
of
the
business
in
order
to
set
her
up
in
it
as
no
woman
thereabouts
was
better
qualified
to
execute
the
plan
she
had
formed
than
herself
the
gentlewoman
very
charitably
undertook
it
and
having
great
influence
over
the
female
part
of
the
parish
she
found
no
difficulty
in
effecting
it
to
the
utmost
of
her
wishes
in
truth
the
parson
join
his
interest
with
his
wife
in
the
whole
affair
and
in
order
to
do
things
as
they
should
be
and
give
the
poor
soul
as
good
a
title
by
law
to
practise
as
his
wife
had
given
by
institution
he
cheerfully
paid
the
fees
for
the
ordinary
licence
himself
amounting
in
the
whole
to
the
sum
of
eighteen
shillings
and
four
pence
so
that
betwixt
them
both
the
good
woman
was
fully
invested
in
the
real
and
corporal
possession
of
her
office
together
with
all
its
rights
members
and
appurtenances
whatsoever
these
last
words
you
must
know
were
not
according
to
the
old
form
in
which
such
licences
faculties
and
powers
usually
ran
which
in
like
cases
had
heretofore
been
granted
to
the
sisterhood
but
it
was
according
to
a
neat
formula
of
didius
his
own
devising
who
having
a
particular
turn
for
taking
to
pieces
and
new
framing
over
again
all
kind
of
instruments
in
that
way
not
only
hit
upon
this
dainty
amendment
but
coaxed
many
of
the
old
licensed
matrons
in
the
neighbourhood
to
open
their
faculties
afresh
in
order
to
have
this
of
his
inserted
i
own
i
never
could
envy
didius
in
these
kinds
of
fancies
of
his
but
every
man
to
his
own
did
not
kunastrokius
that
great
man
at
his
leisure
hours
take
the
greatest
delight
imaginable
in
combing
of
asses
tails
and
plucking
the
dead
hairs
out
with
his
teeth
though
he
had
tweezers
always
in
his
pocket
nay
if
you
come
to
that

not
the
wisest
of

and
so
long
as

and
quietly
along

and
neither
compels
you

me
to
get
up

pray
sir
what
have
either
you
or

to
do
with
it
chapter
de
gustibus
non

disputandum
that
is
there
is
no
disputing
against
and
for
my
part
i
seldom
do
nor
could
i
with
any
sort
of
grace
had
i
been
an
enemy
to
them
at
the
bottom
for
happening
at
certain
intervals
and
changes
of
the
moon
to
be
both
fidler
and
painter
according
as
the
fly
stings
be
it
known
to
you
that
i
keep
a
couple
of
pads
myself
upon
which
in
their
turns
nor
do
i
care
who
knows
it
i
frequently
ride
out
and
take
the
air
though
sometimes
to
my
shame
be
it
spoken
i
take
somewhat
longer
journies
than
what
a
wise
man
would
think
altogether
but
the
truth
is
i
am
not
a
wise
man
and
besides
am
a
mortal
of
so
little
consequence
in
the
world
it
is
not
much
matter
what
i
do
so
i
seldom
fret
or
fume
at
all
about
it
nor
does
it
much
disturb
my
rest
when
i
see
such
great
lords
and
tall
personages
as
hereafter
follow
such
for
instance
as
my
lord

and
so
on
all
of
a
row
mounted
upon
their
several
horses
some
with
large
stirrups
getting
on
in
a
more
grave
and
sober
pace
others
on
the
contrary
tucked
up
to
their
very
chins
with
whips
across
their
mouths
scouring
and
scampering
it
away
like
so
many
little
devils
astride
a
mortgage
and
as
if
some
of
them
were
resolved
to
break
their
so
much
the
better
say
i
to
myself
for
in
case
the
worst
should
happen
the
world
will
make
a
shift
to
do
excellently
well
without
them
and
for
the
rest
why
god
speed
them
let
them
ride
on
without
opposition
from
me
for
were
their
lordships
unhorsed
this
very
night

ten

but
that
many
of
them
would
be
worse
mounted
by
one
half
before
tomorrow
morning
not
one
of
these
instances
therefore
can
be
said
to
break
in
upon
my
but
there
is
an
instance
which
i
own
puts
me
off
my
guard
and
that
is
when
i
see
one
born
for
great
actions
and
what
is
still
more
for
his
honour
whose
nature
ever
inclines
him
to
good
ones
when
i
behold
such
a
one
my
lord
like
yourself
whose
principles
and
conduct
are
as
generous
and
noble
as
his
blood
and
whom
for
that
reason
a
corrupt
world
can
not
spare
one
moment
when
i
see
such
a
one
my
lord
mounted
though
it
is
but
for
a
minute
beyond
the
time
which
my
love
to
my
country
has
prescribed
to
him
and
my
zeal
for
his
glory
wishes
then
my
lord
i
cease
to
be
a
philosopher
and
in
the
first
transport
of
an
honest
impatience
i
wish
the
with
all
his
fraternity
at
the
devil
lord
i
maintain
this
to
be
a
dedication
notwithstanding
its
singularity
in
the
three
great
essentials
of
matter
form
and
place
i
beg
therefore
you
will
accept
it
as
such
and
that
you
will
permit
me
to
lay
it
with
the
most
respectful
humility
at
your
feet
when
you
are
upon
them
which
you
can
be
when
you
please
and
that
is
my
lord
whenever
there
is
occasion
for
it
and
i
will
add
to
the
best
purposes
too
i
have
the
honour
to
be
my
lord
your
lordship
most
obedient
and
most
devoted
and
most
humble
servant
tristram
shandy
chapter
i
solemnly
declare
to
all
mankind
that
the
above
dedication
was
made
for
no
one
prince
prelate
pope
or
potentate
duke
marquis
earl
viscount
or
baron
of
this
or
any
other
realm
in
christendom
nor
has
it
yet
been
hawked
about
or
offered
publicly
or
privately
directly
or
indirectly
to
any
one
person
or
personage
great
or
small
but
is
honestly
a
true
untried
on
upon
any
soul
living
i
labour
this
point
so
particularly
merely
to
remove
any
offence
or
objection
which
might
arise
against
it
from
the
manner
in
which
i
propose
to
make
the
most
of
it
which
is
the
putting
it
up
fairly
to
public
sale
which
i
now
do
every
author
has
a
way
of
his
own
in
bringing
his
points
to
bear
for
my
own
part
as
i
hate
chaffering
and
higgling
for
a
few
guineas
in
a
dark
entry
i
resolved
within
myself
from
the
very
beginning
to
deal
squarely
and
openly
with
your
great
folks
in
this
affair
and
try
whether
i
should
not
come
off
the
better
by
it
if
therefore
there
is
any
one
duke
marquis
earl
viscount
or
baron
in
these
his
majesty
dominions
who
stands
in
need
of
a
tight
genteel
dedication
and
whom
the
above
will
suit
for
by
the
bye
unless
it
suits
in
some
degree
i
will
not
part
with
it
it
is
much
at
his
service
for
fifty
guineas
which
i
am
positive
is
twenty
guineas
less
than
it
ought
to
be
afforded
for
by
any
man
of
genius
my
lord
if
you
examine
it
over
again
it
is
far
from
being
a
gross
piece
of
daubing
as
some
dedications
are
the
design
your
lordship
sees
is
good
the
colouring
transparent
the
drawing
not
amiss
or
to
speak
more
like
a
man
of
science
and
measure
my
piece
in
the
painter
scale
divided
into
i
believe
my
lord
the
outlines
will
turn
out
as
the
composition
as
the
colouring
as
the
expression
and
a
half
and
the
design
if
i
may
be
allowed
my
lord
to
understand
my
own
design
and
supposing
absolute
perfection
in
designing
to
be
as
i
think
it
can
not
well
fall
short
of
besides
all
this
there
is
keeping
in
it
and
the
dark
strokes
in
the
which
is
a
secondary
figure
and
a
kind
of
to
the
whole
give
great
force
to
the
principal
lights
in
your
own
figure
and
make
it
come
off
wonderfully
and
besides
there
is
an
air
of
originality
in
the
tout
ensemble
be
pleased
my
good
lord
to
order
the
sum
to
be
paid
into
the
hands
of
dodsley
for
the
benefit
of
the
author
and
in
the
next
edition
care
shall
be
taken
that
this
chapter
be
expunged
and
your
titles
distinctions
arms
and
good
actions
be
placed
at
the
front
of
the
preceding
chapter
all
which
from
the
words
de
gustibus
non
est
disputandum
and
whatever
else
in
this
book
relates
to
but
no
more
shall
stand
dedicated
to
your
the
rest
i
dedicate
to
the
moon
who
by
the
bye
of
all
the
patrons
or
matrons
i
can
think
of
has
most
power
to
set
my
book
and
make
the
world
run
mad
after
it
bright
goddess
if
thou
art
not
too
busy
with
candid
and
miss
affairs
take
tristram
shandy
under
thy
protection
also
chapter
whatever
degree
of
small
merit
the
act
of
benignity
in
favour
of
the
midwife
might
justly
claim
or
in
whom
that
claim
truly
rested
at
first
sight
seems
not
very
material
to
this
history
certain
however
it
was
that
the
gentlewoman
the
parson
wife
did
run
away
at
that
time
with
the
whole
of
it
and
yet
for
my
life
i
can
not
help
thinking
but
that
the
parson
himself
though
he
had
not
the
good
fortune
to
hit
upon
the
design
first
yet
as
he
heartily
concurred
in
it
the
moment
it
was
laid
before
him
and
as
heartily
parted
with
his
money
to
carry
it
into
execution
had
a
claim
to
some
share
of
it
if
not
to
a
full
half
of
whatever
honour
was
due
to
it
the
world
at
that
time
was
pleased
to
determine
the
matter
otherwise
lay
down
the
book
and
i
will
allow
you
half
a
day
to
give
a
probable
guess
at
the
grounds
of
this
procedure
be
it
known
then
that
for
about
five
years
before
the
date
of
the
midwife
licence
of
which
you
have
had
so
circumstantial
an
account
the
parson
we
have
to
do
with
had
made
himself
a
by
a
breach
of
all
decorum
which
he
had
committed
against
himself
his
station
and
his
office
and
that
was
in
never
appearing
better
or
otherwise
mounted
than
upon
a
lean
sorry
jackass
of
a
horse
value
about
one
pound
fifteen
shillings
who
to
shorten
all
description
of
him
was
full
brother
to
rosinante
as
far
as
similitude
congenial
could
make
him
for
he
answered
his
description
to
a
in
every
thing
except
that
i
do
not
remember
is
any
where
said
that
rosinante
was
and
that
moreover
rosinante
as
is
the
happiness
of
most
spanish
horses
fat
or
lean
was
undoubtedly
a
horse
at
all
points
i
know
very
well
that
the
hero
horse
was
a
horse
of
chaste
deportment
which
may
have
given
grounds
for
the
contrary
opinion
but
it
is
as
certain
at
the
same
time
that
rosinante
continency
as
may
be
demonstrated
from
the
adventure
of
the
yanguesian
carriers
proceeded
from
no
bodily
defect
or
cause
whatsoever
but
from
the
temperance
and
orderly
current
of
his
and
let
me
tell
you
madam
there
is
a
great
deal
of
very
good
chastity
in
the
world
in
behalf
of
which
you
could
not
say
more
for
your
life
let
that
be
as
it
may
as
my
purpose
is
to
do
exact
justice
to
every
creature
brought
upon
the
stage
of
this
dramatic
work
i
could
not
stifle
this
distinction
in
favour
of
don
quixote
horse
in
all
other
points
the
parson
horse
i
say
was
just
such
another
for
he
was
as
lean
and
as
lank
and
as
sorry
a
jade
as
humility
herself
could
have
bestrided
in
the
estimation
of
here
and
there
a
man
of
weak
judgment
it
was
greatly
in
the
parson
power
to
have
helped
the
figure
of
this
horse
of
his
for
he
was
master
of
a
very
handsome
saddle
quilted
on
the
seat
with
green
plush
garnished
with
a
double
row
of
studs
and
a
noble
pair
of
shining
brass
stirrups
with
a
housing
altogether
suitable
of
grey
superfine
cloth
with
an
edging
of
black
lace
terminating
in
a
deep
black
silk
fringe
poudre
all
which
he
had
purchased
in
the
pride
and
prime
of
his
life
together
with
a
grand
embossed
bridle
ornamented
at
all
points
as
it
should
but
not
caring
to
banter
his
beast
he
had
hung
all
these
up
behind
his
study
door
and
in
lieu
of
them
had
seriously
befitted
him
with
just
such
a
bridle
and
such
a
saddle
as
the
figure
and
value
of
such
a
steed
might
well
and
truly
deserve
in
the
several
sallies
about
his
parish
and
in
the
neighbouring
visits
to
the
gentry
who
lived
around
him
you
will
easily
comprehend
that
the
parson
so
appointed
would
both
hear
and
see
enough
to
keep
his
philosophy
from
rusting
to
speak
the
truth
he
never
could
enter
a
village
but
he
caught
the
attention
of
both
old
and
labour
stood
still
as
he
pass
the
bucket
hung
suspended
in
the
middle
of
the
well
the
forgot
its
round
even
and
themselves
stood
gaping
till
he
had
got
out
of
sight
and
as
his
movement
was
not
of
the
quickest
he
had
generally
time
enough
upon
his
hands
to
make
his
observations
to
hear
the
groans
of
the
serious
and
the
laughter
of
the
all
which
he
bore
with
excellent
his
character
was
he
loved
a
jest
in
his
heart
and
as
he
saw
himself
in
the
true
point
of
ridicule
he
would
say
he
could
not
be
angry
with
others
for
seeing
him
in
a
light
in
which
he
so
strongly
saw
himself
so
that
to
his
friends
who
knew
his
foible
was
not
the
love
of
money
and
who
therefore
made
the
less
scruple
in
bantering
the
extravagance
of
his
humour
instead
of
giving
the
true
cause
he
chose
rather
to
join
in
the
laugh
against
himself
and
as
he
never
carried
one
single
ounce
of
flesh
upon
his
own
bones
being
altogether
as
spare
a
figure
as
his
beast
he
would
sometimes
insist
upon
it
that
the
horse
was
as
good
as
the
rider
deserved
that
they
were
both
of
a
piece
at
other
times
and
in
other
moods
when
his
spirits
were
above
the
temptation
of
false
wit
he
would
say
he
found
himself
going
off
fast
in
a
consumption
and
with
great
gravity
would
pretend
he
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
a
fat
horse
without
a
dejection
of
heart
and
a
sensible
alteration
in
his
pulse
and
that
he
had
made
choice
of
the
lean
one
he
rode
upon
not
only
to
keep
himself
in
countenance
but
in
spirits
at
different
times
he
would
give
fifty
humorous
and
apposite
reasons
for
riding
a
jade
of
a
horse
preferably
to
one
of
mettle
for
on
such
a
one
he
could
sit
mechanically
and
meditate
as
delightfully
de
vanitate
mundi
et
fuga
saeculi
as
with
the
advantage
of
a
before
him
that
in
all
other
exercitations
he
could
spend
his
time
as
he
rode
slowly
along
to
as
much
account
as
in
his
study
that
he
could
draw
up
an
argument
in
his
sermon
or
a
hole
in
his
breeches
as
steadily
on
the
one
as
in
the
other
that
brisk
trotting
and
slow
argumentation
like
wit
and
judgment
were
two
incompatible
but
that
upon
his
steed
he
could
unite
and
reconcile
every
thing
he
could
compose
his
sermon
he
could
compose
his
cough
and
in
case
nature
gave
a
call
that
way
he
could
likewise
compose
himself
to
in
short
the
parson
upon
such
encounters
would
assign
any
cause
but
the
true
cause
and
he
withheld
the
true
one
only
out
of
a
nicety
of
temper
because
he
thought
it
did
honour
to
him
but
the
truth
of
the
story
was
as
follows
in
the
first
years
of
this
gentleman
life
and
about
the
time
when
the
superb
saddle
and
bridle
were
purchased
by
him
it
had
been
his
manner
or
vanity
or
call
it
what
you
will
to
run
into
the
opposite
in
the
language
of
the
county
where
he
dwelt
he
was
said
to
have
loved
a
good
horse
and
generally
had
one
of
the
best
in
the
whole
parish
standing
in
his
stable
always
ready
for
saddling
and
as
the
nearest
midwife
as
i
told
you
did
not
live
nearer
to
the
village
than
seven
miles
and
in
a
vile
country
it
so
fell
out
that
the
poor
gentleman
was
scarce
a
whole
week
together
without
some
piteous
application
for
his
beast
and
as
he
was
not
an
man
and
every
case
was
more
pressing
and
more
distressful
than
the
last
as
much
as
he
loved
his
beast
he
had
never
a
heart
to
refuse
him
the
upshot
of
which
was
generally
this
that
his
horse
was
either
clapp
or
spavin
or
greaz
or
he
was
or
or
something
in
short
or
other
had
befallen
him
which
would
let
him
carry
no
flesh
so
that
he
had
every
nine
or
ten
months
a
bad
horse
to
get
rid
of
and
a
good
horse
to
purchase
in
his
stead
what
the
loss
in
such
a
balance
might
amount
to
communibus
annis
i
would
leave
to
a
special
jury
of
sufferers
in
the
same
traffick
to
determine
but
let
it
be
what
it
would
the
honest
gentleman
bore
it
for
many
years
without
a
murmur
till
at
length
by
repeated
ill
accidents
of
the
kind
he
found
it
necessary
to
take
the
thing
under
consideration
and
upon
weighing
the
whole
and
summing
it
up
in
his
mind
he
found
it
not
only
disproportioned
to
his
other
expences
but
withal
so
heavy
an
article
in
itself
as
to
disable
him
from
any
other
act
of
generosity
in
his
parish
besides
this
he
considered
that
with
half
the
sum
thus
galloped
away
he
could
do
ten
times
as
much
good
and
what
still
weighed
more
with
him
than
all
other
considerations
put
together
was
this
that
it
confined
all
his
charity
into
one
particular
channel
and
where
as
he
fancied
it
was
the
least
wanted
namely
to
the
and
part
of
his
parish
reserving
nothing
for
the
impotent
nothing
for
the
aged
nothing
for
the
many
comfortless
scenes
he
was
hourly
called
forth
to
visit
where
poverty
and
sickness
and
affliction
dwelt
together
for
these
reasons
he
resolved
to
discontinue
the
expence
and
there
appeared
but
two
possible
ways
to
extricate
him
clearly
out
of
it
and
these
were
either
to
make
it
an
irrevocable
law
never
more
to
lend
his
steed
upon
any
application
whatever
or
else
be
content
to
ride
the
last
poor
devil
such
as
they
had
made
him
with
all
his
aches
and
infirmities
to
the
very
end
of
the
chapter
as
he
dreaded
his
own
constancy
in
the
first
he
very
chearfully
betook
himself
to
the
second
and
though
he
could
very
well
have
explained
it
as
i
said
to
his
honour
yet
for
that
very
reason
he
had
a
spirit
above
it
choosing
rather
to
bear
the
contempt
of
his
enemies
and
the
laughter
of
his
friends
than
undergo
the
pain
of
telling
a
story
which
might
seem
a
panegyrick
upon
himself
i
have
the
highest
idea
of
the
spiritual
and
refined
sentiments
of
this
reverend
gentleman
from
this
single
stroke
in
his
character
which
i
think
comes
up
to
any
of
the
honest
refinements
of
the
peerless
knight
of
la
mancha
whom
by
the
bye
with
all
his
follies
i
love
more
and
would
actually
have
gone
farther
to
have
paid
a
visit
to
than
the
greatest
hero
of
antiquity
but
this
is
not
the
moral
of
my
story
the
thing
i
had
in
view
was
to
shew
the
temper
of
the
world
in
the
whole
of
this
for
you
must
know
that
so
long
as
this
explanation
would
have
done
the
parson
credit
the
devil
a
soul
could
find
it
out
i
suppose
his
enemies
would
not
and
that
his
friends
could
but
no
sooner
did
he
bestir
himself
in
behalf
of
the
midwife
and
pay
the
expences
of
the
licence
to
set
her
up
but
the
whole
secret
came
out
every
horse
he
had
lost
and
two
horses
more
than
ever
he
had
lost
with
all
the
circumstances
of
their
destruction
were
known
and
distinctly
the
story
ran
like
parson
had
a
returning
fit
of
pride
which
had
just
seized
him
and
he
was
going
to
be
well
mounted
once
again
in
his
life
and
if
it
was
so
was
plain
as
the
sun
at
he
would
pocket
the
expence
of
the
licence
ten
times
told
the
very
first
year
so
that
every
body
was
left
to
judge
what
were
his
views
in
this
act
of
charity
what
were
his
views
in
this
and
in
every
other
action
of
his
life
or
rather
what
were
the
opinions
which
floated
in
the
brains
of
other
people
concerning
it
was
a
thought
which
too
much
floated
in
his
own
and
too
often
broke
in
upon
his
rest
when
he
should
have
been
sound
asleep
about
ten
years
ago
this
gentleman
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
made
entirely
easy
upon
that
score
it
being
just
so
long
since
he
left
his
parish
and
the
whole
world
at
the
same
time
behind
him
and
stands
accountable
to
a
judge
of
whom
he
will
have
no
cause
to
complain
but
there
is
a
fatality
attends
the
actions
of
some
men
order
them
as
they
will
they
pass
thro
a
certain
medium
which
so
twists
and
refracts
them
from
their
true
directions
that
with
all
the
titles
to
praise
which
a
rectitude
of
heart
can
give
the
doers
of
them
are
nevertheless
forced
to
live
and
die
without
it
of
the
truth
of
which
this
gentleman
was
a
painful
but
to
know
by
what
means
this
came
to
pass
and
to
make
that
knowledge
of
use
to
you
i
insist
upon
it
that
you
read
the
two
following
chapters
which
contain
such
a
sketch
of
his
life
and
conversation
as
will
carry
its
moral
along
with
when
this
is
done
if
nothing
stops
us
in
our
way
we
will
go
on
with
the
midwife
chapter
yorick
was
this
parson
name
and
what
is
very
remarkable
in
it
as
appears
from
a
most
ancient
account
of
the
family
wrote
upon
strong
vellum
and
now
in
perfect
preservation
it
had
been
exactly
so
spelt
for
near
i
was
within
an
ace
of
saying
nine
hundred
years
but
i
would
not
shake
my
credit
in
telling
an
improbable
truth
however
indisputable
in
itself
and
therefore
i
shall
content
myself
with
only
saying
it
had
been
exactly
so
spelt
without
the
least
variation
or
transposition
of
a
single
letter
for
i
do
not
know
how
long
which
is
more
than
i
would
venture
to
say
of
one
half
of
the
best
surnames
in
the
kingdom
which
in
a
course
of
years
have
generally
undergone
as
many
chops
and
changes
as
their
has
this
been
owing
to
the
pride
or
to
the
shame
of
the
respective
proprietors
in
honest
truth
i
think
sometimes
to
the
one
and
sometimes
to
the
other
just
as
the
temptation
has
wrought
but
a
villainous
affair
it
is
and
will
one
day
so
blend
and
confound
us
all
together
that
no
one
shall
be
able
to
stand
up
and
swear
his
own
great
grandfather
was
the
man
who
did
either
this
or
that
this
evil
had
been
sufficiently
fenced
against
by
the
prudent
care
of
the
yorick
family
and
their
religious
preservation
of
these
records
i
quote
which
do
farther
inform
us
that
the
family
was
originally
of
danish
extraction
and
had
been
transplanted
into
england
as
early
as
in
the
reign
of
horwendillus
king
of
denmark
in
whose
court
it
seems
an
ancestor
of
this
yorick
and
from
whom
he
was
lineally
descended
held
a
considerable
post
to
the
day
of
his
death
of
what
nature
this
considerable
post
was
this
record
saith
not
it
only
adds
that
for
near
two
centuries
it
had
been
totally
abolished
as
altogether
unnecessary
not
only
in
that
court
but
in
every
other
court
of
the
christian
world
it
has
often
come
into
my
head
that
this
post
could
be
no
other
than
that
of
the
king
chief
jester
and
that
hamlet
yorick
in
our
shakespeare
many
of
whose
plays
you
know
are
founded
upon
authenticated
facts
was
certainly
the
very
man
i
have
not
the
time
to
look
into
danish
history
to
know
the
certainty
of
this
but
if
you
have
leisure
and
can
easily
get
at
the
book
you
may
do
it
full
as
well
yourself
i
had
just
time
in
my
travels
through
denmark
with
noddy
eldest
son
whom
in
the
year
i
accompanied
as
governor
riding
along
with
him
at
a
prodigious
rate
thro
most
parts
of
europe
and
of
which
original
journey
performed
by
us
two
a
most
delectable
narrative
will
be
given
in
the
progress
of
this
work
i
had
just
time
i
say
and
that
was
all
to
prove
the
truth
of
an
observation
made
by
a
long
sojourner
in
that
country
namely
nature
was
neither
very
lavish
nor
was
she
very
stingy
in
her
gifts
of
genius
and
capacity
to
its
inhabitants
but
like
a
discreet
parent
was
moderately
kind
to
them
all
observing
such
an
equal
tenor
in
the
distribution
of
her
favours
as
to
bring
them
in
those
points
pretty
near
to
a
level
with
each
other
so
that
you
will
meet
with
few
instances
in
that
kingdom
of
refined
parts
but
a
great
deal
of
good
plain
houshold
understanding
amongst
all
ranks
of
people
of
which
every
body
has
a
share
which
is
i
think
very
right
with
us
you
see
the
case
is
quite
different
we
are
all
ups
and
downs
in
this
matter
you
are
a
great
genius
or
is
fifty
to
one
sir
you
are
a
great
dunce
and
a
blockhead
not
that
there
is
a
total
want
of
intermediate
steps
no
we
are
not
so
irregular
as
that
comes
to
but
the
two
extremes
are
more
common
and
in
a
greater
degree
in
this
unsettled
island
where
nature
in
her
gifts
and
dispositions
of
this
kind
is
most
whimsical
and
capricious
fortune
herself
not
being
more
so
in
the
bequest
of
her
goods
and
chattels
than
she
this
is
all
that
ever
staggered
my
faith
in
regard
to
extraction
who
by
what
i
can
remember
of
him
and
by
all
the
accounts
i
could
ever
get
of
him
seemed
not
to
have
had
one
single
drop
of
danish
blood
in
his
whole
crasis
in
nine
hundred
years
it
might
possibly
have
all
run
out
i
will
not
philosophize
one
moment
with
you
about
it
for
happen
how
it
would
the
fact
was
this
that
instead
of
that
cold
phlegm
and
exact
regularity
of
sense
and
humours
you
would
have
looked
for
in
one
so
extracted
he
was
on
the
contrary
as
mercurial
and
sublimated
a
composition
as
heteroclite
a
creature
in
all
his
declensions
with
as
much
life
and
whim
and
gaite
de
coeur
about
him
as
the
kindliest
climate
could
have
engendered
and
put
together
with
all
this
sail
poor
yorick
carried
not
one
ounce
of
ballast
he
was
utterly
unpractised
in
the
world
and
at
the
age
of
knew
just
about
as
well
how
to
steer
his
course
in
it
as
a
romping
unsuspicious
girl
of
thirteen
so
that
upon
his
first
setting
out
the
brisk
gale
of
his
spirits
as
you
will
imagine
ran
him
foul
ten
times
in
a
day
of
somebody
tackling
and
as
the
grave
and
more
were
oftenest
in
his
way
you
may
likewise
imagine
was
with
such
he
had
generally
the
ill
luck
to
get
the
most
entangled
for
aught
i
know
there
might
be
some
mixture
of
unlucky
wit
at
the
bottom
of
such
fracas
for
to
speak
the
truth
yorick
had
an
invincible
dislike
and
opposition
in
his
nature
to
gravity
not
to
gravity
as
such
for
where
gravity
was
wanted
he
would
be
the
most
grave
or
serious
of
mortal
men
for
days
and
weeks
together
but
he
was
an
enemy
to
the
affectation
of
it
and
declared
open
war
against
it
only
as
it
appeared
a
cloak
for
ignorance
or
for
folly
and
then
whenever
it
fell
in
his
way
however
sheltered
and
protected
he
seldom
gave
it
much
quarter
sometimes
in
his
wild
way
of
talking
he
would
say
that
gravity
was
an
errant
scoundrel
and
he
would
add
of
the
most
dangerous
kind
too
because
a
sly
one
and
that
he
verily
believed
more
honest
people
were
bubbled
out
of
their
goods
and
money
by
it
in
one
than
by
and
in
seven
in
the
naked
temper
which
a
merry
heart
discovered
he
would
say
there
was
no
danger
but
to
itself
whereas
the
very
essence
of
gravity
was
design
and
consequently
deceit
was
a
taught
trick
to
gain
credit
of
the
world
for
more
sense
and
knowledge
than
a
man
was
worth
and
that
with
all
its
pretensions
it
was
no
better
but
often
worse
than
what
a
french
wit
had
long
ago
defined
it
viz
mysterious
carriage
of
the
body
to
cover
the
defects
of
the
mind
which
definition
of
gravity
yorick
with
great
imprudence
would
say
deserved
to
be
wrote
in
letters
of
gold
but
in
plain
truth
he
was
a
man
unhackneyed
and
unpractised
in
the
world
and
was
altogether
as
indiscreet
and
foolish
on
every
other
subject
of
discourse
where
policy
is
wont
to
impress
restraint
yorick
had
no
impression
but
one
and
that
was
what
arose
from
the
nature
of
the
deed
spoken
of
which
impression
he
would
usually
translate
into
plain
english
without
any
periphrasis
and
too
oft
without
much
distinction
of
either
person
time
or
place
so
that
when
mention
was
made
of
a
pitiful
or
an
ungenerous
proceeding
he
never
gave
himself
a
moment
time
to
reflect
who
was
the
hero
of
the
piece
what
his
station
or
how
far
he
had
power
to
hurt
him
hereafter
but
if
it
was
a
dirty
action
without
more
ado
the
man
was
a
dirty
fellow
and
so
and
as
his
comments
had
usually
the
ill
fate
to
be
terminated
either
in
a
bon
mot
or
to
be
enlivened
throughout
with
some
drollery
or
humour
of
expression
it
gave
wings
to
yorick
indiscretion
in
a
word
tho
he
never
sought
yet
at
the
same
time
as
he
seldom
shunned
occasions
of
saying
what
came
uppermost
and
without
much
ceremony
he
had
but
too
many
temptations
in
life
of
scattering
his
wit
and
his
humour
his
gibes
and
his
jests
about
they
were
not
lost
for
want
of
gathering
what
were
the
consequences
and
what
was
yorick
catastrophe
thereupon
you
will
read
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
the
mortgager
and
mortgagee
differ
the
one
from
the
other
not
more
in
length
of
purse
than
the
jester
and
jestee
do
in
that
of
memory
but
in
this
the
comparison
between
them
runs
as
the
scholiasts
call
it
upon
which
by
the
bye
is
upon
one
or
two
legs
more
than
some
of
the
best
of
homer
can
pretend
to
namely
that
the
one
raises
a
sum
and
the
other
a
laugh
at
your
expence
and
thinks
no
more
about
it
interest
however
still
runs
on
in
both
cases
the
periodical
or
accidental
payments
of
it
just
serving
to
keep
the
memory
of
the
affair
alive
till
at
length
in
some
evil
hour
pop
comes
the
creditor
upon
each
and
by
demanding
principal
upon
the
spot
together
with
full
interest
to
the
very
day
makes
them
both
feel
the
full
extent
of
their
obligations
as
the
reader
for
i
hate
your
ifs
has
a
thorough
knowledge
of
human
nature
i
need
not
say
more
to
satisfy
him
that
my
hero
could
not
go
on
at
this
rate
without
some
slight
experience
of
these
incidental
mementos
to
speak
the
truth
he
had
wantonly
involved
himself
in
a
multitude
of
small
of
this
stamp
which
notwithstanding
eugenius
frequent
advice
he
too
much
disregarded
thinking
that
as
not
one
of
them
was
contracted
thro
any
malignancy
but
on
the
contrary
from
an
honesty
of
mind
and
a
mere
jocundity
of
humour
they
would
all
of
them
be
cross
out
in
course
eugenius
would
never
admit
this
and
would
often
tell
him
that
one
day
or
other
he
would
certainly
be
reckoned
with
and
he
would
often
add
in
an
accent
of
sorrowful
apprehension
to
the
uttermost
mite
to
which
yorick
with
his
usual
carelessness
of
heart
would
as
often
answer
with
a
pshaw
and
if
the
subject
was
started
in
the
fields
with
a
hop
skip
and
a
jump
at
the
end
of
it
but
if
close
pent
up
in
the
social
where
the
culprit
was
barricado
in
with
a
table
and
a
couple
of
and
could
not
so
readily
fly
off
in
a
tangent
eugenius
would
then
go
on
with
his
lecture
upon
discretion
in
words
to
this
purpose
though
somewhat
better
put
together
trust
me
dear
yorick
this
unwary
pleasantry
of
thine
will
sooner
or
later
bring
thee
into
scrapes
and
difficulties
which
no
can
extricate
thee
out
in
these
sallies
too
oft
i
see
it
happens
that
a
person
laughed
at
considers
himself
in
the
light
of
a
person
injured
with
all
the
rights
of
such
a
situation
belonging
to
him
and
when
thou
viewest
him
in
that
light
too
and
reckons
up
his
friends
his
family
his
kindred
and
allies
and
musters
up
with
them
the
many
recruits
which
will
list
under
him
from
a
sense
of
common
danger
is
no
extravagant
arithmetic
to
say
that
for
every
ten
jokes
thou
hast
got
an
hundred
enemies
and
till
thou
hast
gone
on
and
raised
a
swarm
of
wasps
about
thine
ears
and
art
half
stung
to
death
by
them
thou
wilt
never
be
convinced
it
is
so
i
can
not
suspect
it
in
the
man
whom
i
esteem
that
there
is
the
least
spur
from
spleen
or
malevolence
of
intent
in
these
sallies
i
believe
and
know
them
to
be
truly
honest
and
sportive
but
consider
my
dear
lad
that
fools
can
not
distinguish
this
and
that
knaves
will
not
and
thou
knowest
not
what
it
is
either
to
provoke
the
one
or
to
make
merry
with
the
other
whenever
they
associate
for
mutual
defence
depend
upon
it
they
will
carry
on
the
war
in
such
a
manner
against
thee
my
dear
friend
as
to
make
thee
heartily
sick
of
it
and
of
thy
life
too
revenge
from
some
baneful
corner
shall
level
a
tale
of
dishonour
at
thee
which
no
innocence
of
heart
or
integrity
of
conduct
shall
set
the
fortunes
of
thy
house
shall
totter
thy
character
which
led
the
way
to
them
shall
bleed
on
every
side
of
it
thy
faith
questioned
thy
works
belied
thy
wit
forgotten
thy
learning
trampled
on
to
wind
up
the
last
scene
of
thy
tragedy
cruelty
and
cowardice
twin
ruffians
hired
and
set
on
by
malice
in
the
dark
shall
strike
together
at
all
thy
infirmities
and
mistakes
the
best
of
us
my
dear
lad
lie
open
there
and
trust
me
trust
me
yorick
when
to
gratify
a
private
appetite
it
is
once
resolved
upon
that
an
innocent
and
an
helpless
creature
shall
be
sacrificed
is
an
easy
matter
to
pick
up
sticks
enough
from
any
thicket
where
it
has
strayed
to
make
a
fire
to
offer
it
up
with
yorick
scarce
ever
heard
this
sad
vaticination
of
his
destiny
read
over
to
him
but
with
a
tear
stealing
from
his
eye
and
a
promissory
look
attending
it
that
he
was
resolved
for
the
time
to
come
to
ride
his
tit
with
more
but
alas
too
late
a
grand
confederacy
with
and
at
the
head
of
it
was
formed
before
the
first
prediction
of
the
whole
plan
of
the
attack
just
as
eugenius
had
foreboded
was
put
in
execution
all
at
once
with
so
little
mercy
on
the
side
of
the
allies
and
so
little
suspicion
in
yorick
of
what
was
carrying
on
against
him
that
when
he
thought
good
easy
man
full
surely
preferment
was
they
had
smote
his
root
and
then
he
fell
as
many
a
worthy
man
had
fallen
before
him
yorick
however
fought
it
out
with
all
imaginable
gallantry
for
some
time
till
overpowered
by
numbers
and
worn
out
at
length
by
the
calamities
of
the
war
but
more
so
by
the
ungenerous
manner
in
which
it
was
carried
on
he
threw
down
the
sword
and
though
he
kept
up
his
spirits
in
appearance
to
the
last
he
died
nevertheless
as
was
generally
thought
quite
what
inclined
eugenius
to
the
same
opinion
was
as
follows
a
few
hours
before
yorick
breathed
his
last
eugenius
stept
in
with
an
intent
to
take
his
last
sight
and
last
farewell
of
him
upon
his
drawing
yorick
curtain
and
asking
how
he
felt
himself
yorick
looking
up
in
his
face
took
hold
of
his
hand
and
after
thanking
him
for
the
many
tokens
of
his
friendship
to
him
for
which
he
said
if
it
was
their
fate
to
meet
hereafter
he
would
thank
him
again
and
again
he
told
him
he
was
within
a
few
hours
of
giving
his
enemies
the
slip
for
i
hope
not
answered
eugenius
with
tears
trickling
down
his
cheeks
and
with
the
tenderest
tone
that
ever
man
i
hope
not
yorick
said
yorick
replied
with
a
look
up
and
a
gentle
squeeze
of
eugenius
hand
and
that
was
all
but
it
cut
eugenius
to
his
come
come
yorick
quoth
eugenius
wiping
his
eyes
and
summoning
up
the
man
within
him
my
dear
lad
be
comforted
let
not
all
thy
spirits
and
fortitude
forsake
thee
at
this
crisis
when
thou
most
wants
them
who
knows
what
resources
are
in
store
and
what
the
power
of
god
may
yet
do
for
thee
yorick
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart
and
gently
shook
his
head
for
my
part
continued
eugenius
crying
bitterly
as
he
uttered
the
words
i
declare
i
know
not
yorick
how
to
part
with
thee
and
would
gladly
flatter
my
hopes
added
eugenius
chearing
up
his
voice
that
there
is
still
enough
left
of
thee
to
make
a
bishop
and
that
i
may
live
to
see
i
beseech
thee
eugenius
quoth
yorick
taking
off
his
as
well
as
he
could
with
his
left
hand
his
right
being
still
grasped
close
in
that
of
eugenius
i
beseech
thee
to
take
a
view
of
my
i
see
nothing
that
ails
it
replied
eugenius
then
alas
my
friend
said
yorick
let
me
tell
you
that
is
so
bruised
and
with
the
blows
which
and
and
some
others
have
so
unhandsomely
given
me
in
the
dark
that
i
might
say
with
sancho
panca
that
should
i
recover
and
thereupon
be
suffered
to
rain
down
from
heaven
as
thick
as
hail
not
one
of
them
would
fit
it
yorick
last
breath
was
hanging
upon
his
trembling
lips
ready
to
depart
as
he
uttered
this
yet
still
it
was
uttered
with
something
of
a
cervantick
tone
and
as
he
spoke
it
eugenius
could
perceive
a
stream
of
lambent
fire
lighted
up
for
a
moment
in
his
eyes
faint
picture
of
those
flashes
of
his
spirit
which
as
shakespeare
said
of
his
ancestor
were
wont
to
set
the
table
in
a
roar
eugenius
was
convinced
from
this
that
the
heart
of
his
friend
was
broke
he
squeezed
his
hand
and
then
walked
softly
out
of
the
room
weeping
as
he
walked
yorick
followed
eugenius
with
his
eyes
to
the
door
he
then
closed
them
and
never
opened
them
more
he
lies
buried
in
the
corner
of
his
in
the
parish
of
under
a
plain
marble
slab
which
his
friend
eugenius
by
leave
of
his
executors
laid
upon
his
grave
with
no
more
than
these
three
words
of
inscription
serving
both
for
his
epitaph
and
elegy
alas
poor
yorick
ten
times
a
day
has
yorick
ghost
the
consolation
to
hear
his
monumental
inscription
read
over
with
such
a
variety
of
plaintive
tones
as
denote
a
general
pity
and
esteem
for
him
a
crossing
the
close
by
the
side
of
his
grave
not
a
passenger
goes
by
without
stopping
to
cast
a
look
upon
it
and
sighing
as
he
walks
on
alas
poor
yorick
chapter
it
is
so
long
since
the
reader
of
this
rhapsodical
work
has
been
parted
from
the
midwife
that
it
is
high
time
to
mention
her
again
to
him
merely
to
put
him
in
mind
that
there
is
such
a
body
still
in
the
world
and
whom
upon
the
best
judgment
i
can
form
upon
my
own
plan
at
present
i
am
going
to
introduce
to
him
for
good
and
all
but
as
fresh
matter
may
be
started
and
much
unexpected
business
fall
out
betwixt
the
reader
and
myself
which
may
require
immediate
dispatch
was
right
to
take
care
that
the
poor
woman
should
not
be
lost
in
the
mean
time
because
when
she
is
wanted
we
can
no
way
do
without
her
i
think
i
told
you
that
this
good
woman
was
a
person
of
no
small
note
and
consequence
throughout
our
whole
village
and
township
that
her
fame
had
spread
itself
to
the
very
and
circumference
of
that
circle
of
importance
of
which
kind
every
soul
living
whether
he
has
a
shirt
to
his
back
or
no
has
one
surrounding
him
which
said
circle
by
the
way
whenever
is
said
that
such
a
one
is
of
great
weight
and
importance
in
the
world
i
desire
may
be
enlarged
or
contracted
in
your
worship
fancy
in
a
compound
ratio
of
the
station
profession
knowledge
abilities
height
and
depth
measuring
both
ways
of
the
personage
brought
before
you
in
the
present
case
if
i
remember
i
fixed
it
about
four
or
five
miles
which
not
only
comprehended
the
whole
parish
but
extended
itself
to
two
or
three
of
the
adjacent
hamlets
in
the
skirts
of
the
next
parish
which
made
a
considerable
thing
of
it
i
must
add
that
she
was
moreover
very
well
looked
on
at
one
large
and
some
other
odd
houses
and
farms
within
two
or
three
miles
as
i
said
from
the
smoke
of
her
own
chimney
but
i
must
here
once
for
all
inform
you
that
all
this
will
be
more
exactly
delineated
and
explain
in
a
map
now
in
the
hands
of
the
engraver
which
with
many
other
pieces
and
developements
of
this
work
will
be
added
to
the
end
of
the
twentieth
volume
not
to
swell
the
work
i
detest
the
thought
of
such
a
thing
but
by
way
of
commentary
scholium
illustration
and
key
to
such
passages
incidents
or
inuendos
as
shall
be
thought
to
be
either
of
private
interpretation
or
of
dark
or
doubtful
meaning
after
my
life
and
my
opinions
shall
have
been
read
over
now
do
forget
the
meaning
of
the
word
by
all
the
world
which
betwixt
you
and
me
and
in
spite
of
all
the
in
great
britain
and
of
all
that
their
worships
shall
undertake
to
write
or
say
to
the
contrary
i
am
determined
shall
be
the
i
need
not
tell
your
worship
that
all
this
is
spoke
in
confidence
chapter
upon
looking
into
my
mother
marriage
settlement
in
order
to
satisfy
myself
and
reader
in
a
point
necessary
to
be
cleared
up
before
we
could
proceed
any
farther
in
this
history
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
pop
upon
the
very
thing
i
wanted
before
i
had
read
a
day
and
a
half
straight
forwards
it
might
have
taken
me
up
a
month
which
shews
plainly
that
when
a
man
sits
down
to
write
a
history
tho
it
be
but
the
history
of
jack
hickathrift
or
tom
thumb
he
knows
no
more
than
his
heels
what
lets
and
confounded
hindrances
he
is
to
meet
with
in
his
way
or
what
a
dance
he
may
be
led
by
one
excursion
or
another
before
all
is
over
could
a
historiographer
drive
on
his
history
as
a
muleteer
drives
on
his
mule
straight
forward
for
instance
from
rome
all
the
way
to
loretto
without
ever
once
turning
his
head
aside
either
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
he
might
venture
to
foretell
you
to
an
hour
when
he
should
get
to
his
journey
end
but
the
thing
is
morally
speaking
impossible
for
if
he
is
a
man
of
the
least
spirit
he
will
have
fifty
deviations
from
a
straight
line
to
make
with
this
or
that
party
as
he
goes
along
which
he
can
no
ways
avoid
he
will
have
views
and
prospects
to
himself
perpetually
soliciting
his
eye
which
he
can
no
more
help
standing
still
to
look
at
than
he
can
fly
he
will
moreover
have
various
accounts
to
reconcile
anecdotes
to
pick
up
inscriptions
to
make
out
stories
to
weave
in
traditions
to
sift
personages
to
call
upon
panegyricks
to
paste
up
at
this
door
pasquinades
at
that
all
which
both
the
man
and
his
mule
are
quite
exempt
from
to
sum
up
all
there
are
archives
at
every
stage
to
be
look
into
and
rolls
records
documents
and
endless
genealogies
which
justice
ever
and
anon
calls
him
back
to
stay
the
reading
of
in
short
there
is
no
end
of
it
for
my
own
part
i
declare
i
have
been
at
it
these
six
weeks
making
all
the
speed
i
possibly
could
and
am
not
yet
born
i
have
just
been
able
and
that
all
to
tell
you
when
it
happen
but
not
how
so
that
you
see
the
thing
is
yet
far
from
being
accomplished
these
unforeseen
stoppages
which
i
own
i
had
no
conception
of
when
i
first
set
out
but
which
i
am
convinced
now
will
rather
increase
than
diminish
as
i
advance
have
struck
out
a
hint
which
i
am
resolved
to
follow
and
that
is
not
to
be
in
a
hurry
but
to
go
on
leisurely
writing
and
publishing
two
volumes
of
my
life
every
year
which
if
i
am
suffered
to
go
on
quietly
and
can
make
a
tolerable
bargain
with
my
bookseller
i
shall
continue
to
do
as
long
as
i
live
chapter
the
article
in
my
mother
which
i
told
the
reader
i
was
at
the
pains
to
search
for
and
which
now
that
i
have
found
it
i
think
proper
to
lay
before
him
is
so
much
more
fully
express
in
the
deed
itself
than
ever
i
can
pretend
to
do
it
that
it
would
be
barbarity
to
take
it
out
of
the
lawyer
hand
it
is
as
follows
this
indenture

witnesseth
that
the

mother
was
to

she
chose

but
in
order
to
put
a
stop
to
the
practice
of
any
unfair
play
on
the
part
of
my
mother
which
a
of
this
nature
too
manifestly
opened
a
door
to
and
which
indeed
had
never
been
thought
of
at
all
but
for
my
uncle
toby
shandy
a
clause
was
added
in
security
of
my
father
which
was
this
in
case
my
mother
hereafter
should
at
any
time
put
my
father
to
the
trouble
and
expence
of
a
london
journey
upon
false
cries
and
tokens
that
for
every
such
instance
she
should
forfeit
all
the
right
and
title
which
the
covenant
gave
her
to
the
next
turn
but
to
no
more
and
so
on
toties
quoties
in
as
effectual
a
manner
as
if
such
a
covenant
betwixt
them
had
not
been
made
this
by
the
way
was
no
more
than
what
was
reasonable
and
yet
as
reasonable
as
it
was
i
have
ever
thought
it
hard
that
the
whole
weight
of
the
article
should
have
fallen
entirely
as
it
did
upon
myself
but
i
was
begot
and
born
to
misfortunes
for
my
poor
mother
whether
it
was
wind
or
water
or
a
compound
of
both
or
neither
or
whether
it
was
simply
the
mere
swell
of
imagination
and
fancy
in
her
or
how
far
a
strong
wish
and
desire
to
have
it
so
might
mislead
her
judgment
in
short
whether
she
was
deceived
or
deceiving
in
this
matter
it
no
way
becomes
me
to
decide
the
fact
was
this
that
in
the
latter
end
of
september
which
was
the
year
before
i
was
born
my
mother
having
carried
my
father
up
to
town
much
against
the
grain
he
peremptorily
insisted
upon
the
clause
so
that
i
was
doom
by
to
have
my
nose
squeez
as
flat
to
my
face
as
if
the
destinies
had
actually
spun
me
without
one
how
this
event
came
about
and
what
a
train
of
vexatious
disappointments
in
one
stage
or
other
of
my
life
have
pursued
me
from
the
mere
loss
or
rather
compression
of
this
one
single
member
shall
be
laid
before
the
reader
all
in
due
time
chapter
my
father
as
any
body
may
naturally
imagine
came
down
with
my
mother
into
the
country
in
but
a
pettish
kind
of
a
humour
the
first
twenty
or
miles
he
did
nothing
in
the
world
but
fret
and
teaze
himself
and
indeed
my
mother
too
about
the
cursed
expence
which
he
said
might
every
shilling
of
it
have
been
saved
then
what
vexed
him
more
than
every
thing
else
was
the
provoking
time
of
the
year
which
as
i
told
you
was
towards
the
end
of
september
when
his
and
green
gages
especially
in
which
he
was
very
curious
were
just
ready
for
pulling
he
been
whistled
up
to
london
upon
a
tom
errand
in
any
other
month
of
the
whole
year
he
should
not
have
said
three
words
about
it
for
the
next
two
whole
stages
no
subject
would
go
down
but
the
heavy
blow
he
had
sustain
from
the
loss
of
a
son
whom
it
seems
he
had
fully
reckon
upon
in
his
mind
and
register
down
in
his
as
a
second
staff
for
his
old
age
in
case
bobby
should
fail
him
disappointment
of
this
he
said
was
ten
times
more
to
a
wise
man
than
all
the
money
which
the
journey
had
cost
him
put
together
rot
the
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
he
did
not
mind
it
a
rush
from
stilton
all
the
way
to
grantham
nothing
in
the
whole
affair
provoked
him
so
much
as
the
condolences
of
his
friends
and
the
foolish
figure
they
should
both
make
at
church
the
first
sunday
of
which
in
the
satirical
vehemence
of
his
wit
now
sharpen
a
little
by
vexation
he
would
give
so
many
humorous
and
provoking
descriptions
and
place
his
rib
and
self
in
so
many
tormenting
lights
and
attitudes
in
the
face
of
the
whole
congregation
that
my
mother
declared
these
two
stages
were
so
truly
that
she
did
nothing
but
laugh
and
cry
in
a
breath
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
them
all
the
way
from
grantham
till
they
had
cross
the
trent
my
father
was
out
of
all
kind
of
patience
at
the
vile
trick
and
imposition
which
he
fancied
my
mother
had
put
upon
him
in
this
affair
he
would
say
to
himself
over
and
over
again
woman
could
not
be
deceived
herself
if
she
could
what
weakness
tormenting
word
which
led
his
imagination
a
thorny
dance
and
before
all
was
over
play
the
duce
and
all
with
him
for
sure
as
ever
the
word
weakness
was
uttered
and
struck
full
upon
his
brain
so
sure
it
set
him
upon
running
divisions
upon
how
many
kinds
of
weaknesses
there
were
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
weakness
of
the
body
as
well
as
weakness
of
the
mind
and
then
he
would
do
nothing
but
syllogize
within
himself
for
a
stage
or
two
together
how
far
the
cause
of
all
these
vexations
might
or
might
not
have
arisen
out
of
himself
in
short
he
had
so
many
little
subjects
of
disquietude
springing
out
of
this
one
affair
all
fretting
successively
in
his
mind
as
they
rose
up
in
it
that
my
mother
whatever
was
her
journey
up
had
but
an
uneasy
journey
of
it
in
a
word
as
she
complained
to
my
uncle
toby
he
would
have
tired
out
the
patience
of
any
flesh
alive
chapter
though
my
father
travelled
homewards
as
i
told
you
in
none
of
the
best
of
moods
pshawing
and
pishing
all
the
way
down
yet
he
had
the
complaisance
to
keep
the
worst
part
of
the
story
still
to
himself
which
was
the
resolution
he
had
taken
of
doing
himself
the
justice
which
my
uncle
toby
clause
in
the
empowered
him
nor
was
it
till
the
very
night
in
which
i
was
begot
which
was
thirteen
months
after
that
she
had
the
least
intimation
of
his
design
when
my
father
happening
as
you
remember
to
be
a
little
chagrin
and
out
of
temper
took
occasion
as
they
lay
chatting
gravely
in
bed
afterwards
talking
over
what
was
to
come
to
let
her
know
that
she
must
accommodate
herself
as
well
as
she
could
to
the
bargain
made
between
them
in
their
which
was
to
of
her
next
child
in
the
country
to
balance
the
last
year
journey
my
father
was
a
gentleman
of
many
virtues
but
he
had
a
strong
spice
of
that
in
his
temper
which
might
or
might
not
add
to
the
is
known
by
the
name
of
perseverance
in
a
good
cause
and
of
obstinacy
in
a
bad
one
of
this
my
mother
had
so
much
knowledge
that
she
knew
was
to
no
purpose
to
make
any
remonstrance
so
she
resolved
to
sit
down
quietly
and
make
the
most
of
it
chapter
as
the
point
was
that
night
agreed
or
rather
determined
that
my
mother
should
of
me
in
the
country
she
took
her
measures
accordingly
for
which
purpose
when
she
was
three
days
or
thereabouts
gone
with
child
she
began
to
cast
her
eyes
upon
the
midwife
whom
you
have
so
often
heard
me
mention
and
before
the
week
was
well
got
round
as
the
famous
manningham
was
not
to
be
had
she
had
come
to
a
final
determination
in
her
mind
notwithstanding
there
was
a
scientific
operator
within
so
near
a
call
as
eight
miles
of
us
and
who
moreover
had
expressly
wrote
a
five
shillings
book
upon
the
subject
of
midwifery
in
which
he
had
exposed
not
only
the
blunders
of
the
sisterhood
itself
but
had
likewise
many
curious
improvements
for
the
quicker
extraction
of
the
foetus
in
cross
births
and
some
other
cases
of
danger
which
belay
us
in
getting
into
the
world
notwithstanding
all
this
my
mother
i
say
was
absolutely
determined
to
trust
her
life
and
mine
with
it
into
no
soul
hand
but
this
old
woman
now
this
i
like
when
we
can
not
get
at
the
very
thing
we
wish
never
to
take
up
with
the
next
best
in
degree
to
it
no
that
pitiful
beyond
description
it
is
no
more
than
a
week
from
this
very
day
in
which
i
am
now
writing
this
book
for
the
edification
of
the
world
which
is
march
that
my
dear
dear
jenny
observing
i
looked
a
little
grave
as
she
stood
cheapening
a
silk
of
shillings
a
yard
told
the
mercer
she
was
sorry
she
had
given
him
so
much
trouble
and
immediately
went
and
bought
herself
a
stuff
of
a
is
the
duplication
of
one
and
the
same
greatness
of
soul
only
what
lessened
the
honour
of
it
somewhat
in
my
case
was
that
she
could
not
heroine
it
into
so
violent
and
hazardous
an
extreme
as
one
in
her
situation
might
have
wished
because
the
old
midwife
had
really
some
little
claim
to
be
depended
upon
as
much
at
least
as
success
could
give
her
having
in
the
course
of
her
practice
of
near
twenty
years
in
the
parish
brought
every
mother
son
of
them
into
the
world
without
any
one
slip
or
accident
which
could
fairly
be
laid
to
her
account
these
facts
tho
they
had
their
weight
yet
did
not
altogether
satisfy
some
few
scruples
and
uneasinesses
which
hung
upon
my
father
spirits
in
relation
to
this
to
say
nothing
of
the
natural
workings
of
humanity
and
justice
or
of
the
yearnings
of
parental
and
connubial
love
all
which
prompted
him
to
leave
as
little
to
hazard
as
possible
in
a
case
of
this
kind
he
felt
himself
concerned
in
a
particular
manner
that
all
should
go
right
in
the
present
case
from
the
accumulated
sorrow
he
lay
open
to
should
any
evil
betide
his
wife
and
child
in
at
he
knew
the
world
judged
by
events
and
would
add
to
his
afflictions
in
such
a
misfortune
by
loading
him
with
the
whole
blame
of
had
shandy
poor
gentlewoman
had
but
her
wish
in
going
up
to
town
just
to
and
come
down
again
which
they
say
she
begged
and
prayed
for
upon
her
bare
knees
and
which
in
my
opinion
considering
the
fortune
which
shandy
got
with
her
was
no
such
mighty
matter
to
have
complied
with
the
lady
and
her
babe
might
both
of
them
have
been
alive
at
this
hour
this
exclamation
my
father
knew
was
unanswerable
and
yet
it
was
not
merely
to
shelter
himself
nor
was
it
altogether
for
the
care
of
his
offspring
and
wife
that
he
seemed
so
extremely
anxious
about
this
point
my
father
had
extensive
views
of
things
and
stood
moreover
as
he
thought
deeply
concerned
in
it
for
the
publick
good
from
the
dread
he
entertained
of
the
bad
uses
an
instance
might
be
put
to
he
was
very
sensible
that
all
political
writers
upon
the
subject
had
unanimously
agreed
and
lamented
from
the
beginning
of
queen
reign
down
to
his
own
time
that
the
current
of
men
and
money
towards
the
metropolis
upon
one
frivolous
errand
or
another
set
in
so
strong
as
to
become
dangerous
to
our
civil
rights
though
by
the
bye
a
current
was
not
the
image
he
took
most
delight
in
a
distemper
was
here
his
favourite
metaphor
and
he
would
run
it
down
into
a
perfect
allegory
by
maintaining
it
was
identically
the
same
in
the
body
national
as
in
the
body
natural
where
the
blood
and
spirits
were
driven
up
into
the
head
faster
than
they
could
find
their
ways
down
a
stoppage
of
circulation
must
ensue
which
was
death
in
both
cases
there
was
little
danger
he
would
say
of
losing
our
liberties
by
french
politicks
or
french
invasions
nor
was
he
so
much
in
pain
of
a
consumption
from
the
mass
of
corrupted
matter
and
ulcerated
humours
in
our
constitution
which
he
hoped
was
not
so
bad
as
it
was
imagined
but
he
verily
feared
that
in
some
violent
push
we
should
go
off
all
at
once
in
a
and
then
he
would
say
the
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
all
my
father
was
never
able
to
give
the
history
of
this
distemper
without
the
remedy
along
with
it
i
an
absolute
prince
he
would
say
pulling
up
his
breeches
with
both
his
hands
as
he
rose
from
his
would
appoint
able
judges
at
every
avenue
of
my
metropolis
who
should
take
cognizance
of
every
fool
business
who
came
there
and
if
upon
a
fair
and
candid
hearing
it
appeared
not
of
weight
sufficient
to
leave
his
own
home
and
come
up
bag
and
baggage
with
his
wife
and
children
farmer
sons
at
his
backside
they
should
be
all
sent
back
from
constable
to
constable
like
vagrants
as
they
were
to
the
place
of
their
legal
settlements
by
this
means
i
shall
take
care
that
my
metropolis
totter
not
thro
its
own
weight
that
the
head
be
no
longer
too
big
for
the
body
that
the
extremes
now
wasted
and
pinn
in
be
restored
to
their
due
share
of
nourishment
and
regain
with
it
their
natural
strength
and
beauty
i
would
effectually
provide
that
the
meadows
and
corn
fields
of
my
dominions
should
laugh
and
sing
that
good
chear
and
hospitality
flourish
once
more
and
that
such
weight
and
influence
be
put
thereby
into
the
hands
of
the
squirality
of
my
kingdom
as
should
counterpoise
what
i
perceive
my
nobility
are
now
taking
from
them
are
there
so
few
palaces
and
gentlemen
seats
he
would
ask
with
some
emotion
as
he
walked
across
the
room
so
many
delicious
provinces
in
france
whence
is
it
that
the
few
remaining
chateaus
amongst
them
are
so
dismantled
so
unfurnished
and
in
so
ruinous
and
desolate
a
condition
because
sir
he
would
say
that
kingdom
no
man
has
any
to
support
the
little
interest
of
any
kind
which
any
man
has
any
where
in
it
is
concentrated
in
the
court
and
the
looks
of
the
grand
monarch
by
the
sunshine
of
whose
countenance
or
the
clouds
which
pass
across
it
every
french
man
lives
or
dies
another
political
reason
which
prompted
my
father
so
strongly
to
guard
against
the
least
evil
accident
in
my
mother
in
the
country
was
that
any
such
instance
would
infallibly
throw
a
balance
of
power
too
great
already
into
the
weaker
vessels
of
the
gentry
in
his
own
or
higher
stations
which
with
the
many
other
usurped
rights
which
that
part
of
the
constitution
was
hourly
establishing
would
in
the
end
prove
fatal
to
the
monarchical
system
of
domestick
government
established
in
the
first
creation
of
things
by
god
in
this
point
he
was
entirely
of
sir
robert
filmer
opinion
that
the
plans
and
institutions
of
the
greatest
monarchies
in
the
eastern
parts
of
the
world
were
originally
all
stolen
from
that
admirable
pattern
and
prototype
of
this
houshold
and
paternal
power
which
for
a
century
he
said
and
more
had
gradually
been
degenerating
away
into
a
mix
government
the
form
of
which
however
desirable
in
great
combinations
of
the
species
was
very
troublesome
in
small
ones
and
seldom
produced
any
thing
that
he
saw
but
sorrow
and
confusion
for
all
these
reasons
private
and
publick
put
together
my
father
was
for
having
the
by
all
means
my
mother
by
no
means
my
father
begg
and
intreated
she
would
for
once
recede
from
her
prerogative
in
this
matter
and
suffer
him
to
choose
for
her
my
mother
on
the
contrary
insisted
upon
her
privilege
in
this
matter
to
choose
for
herself
and
have
no
mortal
help
but
the
old
what
could
my
father
do
he
was
almost
at
his
end
talked
it
over
with
her
in
all
moods
placed
his
arguments
in
all
lights
argued
the
matter
with
her
like
a
christian
like
a
heathen
like
a
husband
like
a
father
like
a
patriot
like
a
man
my
mother
answered
every
thing
only
like
a
woman
which
was
a
little
hard
upon
her
for
as
she
could
not
assume
and
fight
it
out
behind
such
a
variety
of
characters
was
no
fair
match
was
seven
to
what
could
my
mother
do
she
had
the
advantage
otherwise
she
had
been
certainly
overpowered
of
a
small
reinforcement
of
chagrin
personal
at
the
bottom
which
bore
her
up
and
enabled
her
to
dispute
the
affair
with
my
father
with
so
equal
an
advantage
that
both
sides
sung
te
deum
in
a
word
my
mother
was
to
have
the
old
woman
and
the
operator
was
to
have
licence
to
drink
a
bottle
of
wine
with
my
father
and
my
uncle
toby
shandy
in
the
back
parlour
for
which
he
was
to
be
paid
five
guineas
i
must
beg
leave
before
i
finish
this
chapter
to
enter
a
caveat
in
the
breast
of
my
fair
reader
and
it
is
this
not
to
take
it
absolutely
for
granted
from
an
unguarded
word
or
two
which
i
have
dropp
in
it
i
am
a
married
man
i
own
the
tender
appellation
of
my
dear
dear
jenny
with
some
other
strokes
of
conjugal
knowledge
interspersed
here
and
there
might
naturally
enough
have
misled
the
most
candid
judge
in
the
world
into
such
a
determination
against
all
i
plead
for
in
this
case
madam
is
strict
justice
and
that
you
do
so
much
of
it
to
me
as
well
as
to
yourself
as
not
to
prejudge
or
receive
such
an
impression
of
me
till
you
have
better
evidence
than
i
am
positive
at
present
can
be
produced
against
not
that
i
can
be
so
vain
or
unreasonable
madam
as
to
desire
you
should
therefore
think
that
my
dear
dear
jenny
is
my
kept
mistress
no
that
would
be
flattering
my
character
in
the
other
extreme
and
giving
it
an
air
of
freedom
which
perhaps
it
has
no
kind
of
right
to
all
i
contend
for
is
the
utter
impossibility
for
some
volumes
that
you
or
the
most
penetrating
spirit
upon
earth
should
know
how
this
matter
really
it
is
not
impossible
but
that
my
dear
dear
jenny
tender
as
the
appellation
is
may
be
my
consider
i
was
born
in
the
year
nor
is
there
any
thing
unnatural
or
extravagant
in
the
supposition
that
my
dear
jenny
may
be
my
friend
my
surely
madam
a
friendship
between
the
two
sexes
may
subsist
and
be
supported
without
fy
shandy
without
any
thing
madam
but
that
tender
and
delicious
sentiment
which
ever
mixes
in
friendship
where
there
is
a
difference
of
sex
let
me
intreat
you
to
study
the
pure
and
sentimental
parts
of
the
best
french
romances
it
will
really
madam
astonish
you
to
see
with
what
a
variety
of
chaste
expressions
this
delicious
sentiment
which
i
have
the
honour
to
speak
of
is
dress
out
chapter
i
would
sooner
undertake
to
explain
the
hardest
problem
in
geometry
than
pretend
to
account
for
it
that
a
gentleman
of
my
father
great
good
sense
knowing
as
the
reader
must
have
observed
him
and
curious
too
in
philosophy
wise
also
in
political
reasoning
and
in
polemical
as
he
will
find
no
way
ignorant
could
be
capable
of
entertaining
a
notion
in
his
head
so
out
of
the
common
track
that
i
fear
the
reader
when
i
come
to
mention
it
to
him
if
he
is
the
least
of
a
cholerick
temper
will
immediately
throw
the
book
by
if
mercurial
he
will
laugh
most
heartily
at
it
and
if
he
is
of
a
grave
and
saturnine
cast
he
will
at
first
sight
absolutely
condemn
as
fanciful
and
extravagant
and
that
was
in
respect
to
the
choice
and
imposition
of
christian
names
on
which
he
thought
a
great
deal
more
depended
than
what
superficial
minds
were
capable
of
conceiving
his
opinion
in
this
matter
was
that
there
was
a
strange
kind
of
magick
bias
which
good
or
bad
names
as
he
called
them
irresistibly
impressed
upon
our
characters
and
conduct
the
hero
of
cervantes
argued
not
the
point
with
more
seriousness
nor
had
he
more
faith
or
more
to
say
on
the
powers
of
necromancy
in
dishonouring
his
deeds
or
on
dulcinea
name
in
shedding
lustre
upon
them
than
my
father
had
on
those
of
trismegistus
or
archimedes
on
the
one
hand
or
of
nyky
and
simkin
on
the
other
how
many
caesars
and
pompeys
he
would
say
by
mere
inspiration
of
the
names
have
been
rendered
worthy
of
them
and
how
many
he
would
add
are
there
who
might
have
done
exceeding
well
in
the
world
had
not
their
characters
and
spirits
been
totally
depressed
and
nicodemus
into
nothing
i
see
plainly
sir
by
your
looks
or
as
the
case
happened
my
father
would
say
that
you
do
not
heartily
subscribe
to
this
opinion
of
mine
which
to
those
he
would
add
who
have
not
carefully
sifted
it
to
the
bottom
i
own
has
an
air
more
of
fancy
than
of
solid
reasoning
in
it
and
yet
my
dear
sir
if
i
may
presume
to
know
your
character
i
am
morally
assured
i
should
hazard
little
in
stating
a
case
to
you
not
as
a
party
in
the
dispute
but
as
a
judge
and
trusting
my
appeal
upon
it
to
your
own
good
sense
and
candid
disquisition
in
this
matter
you
are
a
person
free
from
as
many
narrow
prejudices
of
education
as
most
men
and
if
i
may
presume
to
penetrate
farther
into
you
of
a
liberality
of
genius
above
bearing
down
an
opinion
merely
because
it
wants
friends
your
son
your
dear
son
from
whose
sweet
and
open
temper
you
have
so
much
to
your
billy
sir
would
you
for
the
world
have
called
him
judas
would
you
my
dear
sir
he
would
say
laying
his
hand
upon
your
breast
with
the
genteelest
address
and
in
that
soft
and
irresistible
piano
of
voice
which
the
nature
of
the
argumentum
ad
hominem
absolutely
requires
would
you
sir
if
a
jew
of
a
godfather
had
proposed
the
name
for
your
child
and
offered
you
his
purse
along
with
it
would
you
have
consented
to
such
a
desecration
of
him
o
my
god
he
would
say
looking
up
if
i
know
your
temper
right
sir
you
are
incapable
of
it
you
would
have
trampled
upon
the
offer
you
would
have
thrown
the
temptation
at
the
tempter
head
with
abhorrence
your
greatness
of
mind
in
this
action
which
i
admire
with
that
generous
contempt
of
money
which
you
shew
me
in
the
whole
transaction
is
really
noble
and
what
renders
it
more
so
is
the
principle
of
it
the
workings
of
a
parent
love
upon
the
truth
and
conviction
of
this
very
hypothesis
namely
that
was
your
son
called
judas
the
forbid
and
treacherous
idea
so
inseparable
from
the
name
would
have
accompanied
him
through
life
like
his
shadow
and
in
the
end
made
a
miser
and
a
rascal
of
him
in
spite
sir
of
your
example
i
never
knew
a
man
able
to
answer
this
but
indeed
to
speak
of
my
father
as
he
was
he
was
certainly
irresistible
both
in
his
orations
and
disputations
he
was
born
an
orator
greek
persuasion
hung
upon
his
lips
and
the
elements
of
logick
and
rhetorick
were
so
blended
up
in
him
and
withal
he
had
so
shrewd
a
guess
at
the
weaknesses
and
passions
of
his
respondent
that
nature
might
have
stood
up
and
said
man
is
eloquent
in
short
whether
he
was
on
the
weak
or
the
strong
side
of
the
question
was
hazardous
in
either
case
to
attack
and
yet
is
strange
he
had
never
read
cicero
nor
quintilian
de
oratore
nor
isocrates
nor
aristotle
nor
longinus
amongst
the
antients
nor
vossius
nor
skioppius
nor
ramus
nor
farnaby
amongst
the
moderns
and
what
is
more
astonishing
he
had
never
in
his
whole
life
the
least
light
or
spark
of
subtilty
struck
into
his
mind
by
one
single
lecture
upon
crackenthorp
or
burgersdicius
or
any
dutch
logician
or
commentator
he
knew
not
so
much
as
in
what
the
difference
of
an
argument
ad
ignorantiam
and
an
argument
ad
hominem
consisted
so
that
i
well
remember
when
he
went
up
along
with
me
to
enter
my
name
at
jesus
college
in
it
was
a
matter
of
just
wonder
with
my
worthy
tutor
and
two
or
three
fellows
of
that
learned
society
that
a
man
who
knew
not
so
much
as
the
names
of
his
tools
should
be
able
to
work
after
that
fashion
with
them
to
work
with
them
in
the
best
manner
he
could
was
what
my
father
was
however
perpetually
forced
upon
for
he
had
a
thousand
little
sceptical
notions
of
the
comick
kind
to
defend
most
of
which
notions
i
verily
believe
at
first
entered
upon
the
footing
of
mere
whims
and
of
a
vive
la
bagatelle
and
as
such
he
would
make
merry
with
them
for
half
an
hour
or
so
and
having
sharpened
his
wit
upon
them
dismiss
them
till
another
day
i
mention
this
not
only
as
matter
of
hypothesis
or
conjecture
upon
the
progress
and
establishment
of
my
father
many
odd
opinions
but
as
a
warning
to
the
learned
reader
against
the
indiscreet
reception
of
such
guests
who
after
a
free
and
undisturbed
entrance
for
some
years
into
our
brains
at
length
claim
a
kind
of
settlement
there
working
sometimes
like
yeast
but
more
generally
after
the
manner
of
the
gentle
passion
beginning
in
jest
but
ending
in
downright
earnest
whether
this
was
the
case
of
the
singularity
of
my
father
notions
or
that
his
judgment
at
length
became
the
dupe
of
his
wit
or
how
far
in
many
of
his
notions
he
might
though
odd
be
absolutely
right
the
reader
as
he
comes
at
them
shall
decide
all
that
i
maintain
here
is
that
in
this
one
of
the
influence
of
christian
names
however
it
gained
footing
he
was
serious
he
was
all
uniformity
he
was
systematical
and
like
all
systematic
reasoners
he
would
move
both
heaven
and
earth
and
twist
and
torture
every
thing
in
nature
to
support
his
hypothesis
in
a
word
i
repeat
it
over
again
he
was
serious
and
in
consequence
of
it
he
would
lose
all
kind
of
patience
whenever
he
saw
people
especially
of
condition
who
should
have
known
better
as
careless
and
as
indifferent
about
the
name
they
imposed
upon
their
child
or
more
so
than
in
the
choice
of
ponto
or
cupid
for
their
this
he
would
say
look
ill
and
had
moreover
this
particular
aggravation
in
it
viz
that
when
once
a
vile
name
was
wrongfully
or
injudiciously
given
was
not
like
the
case
of
a
man
character
which
when
wrong
might
hereafter
be
cleared
and
possibly
some
time
or
other
if
not
in
the
man
life
at
least
after
his
death
be
somehow
or
other
set
to
rights
with
the
world
but
the
injury
of
this
he
would
say
could
never
be
undone
nay
he
doubted
even
whether
an
act
of
parliament
could
reach
it
he
knew
as
well
as
you
that
the
legislature
assumed
a
power
over
surnames
but
for
very
strong
reasons
which
he
could
give
it
had
never
yet
adventured
he
would
say
to
go
a
step
farther
it
was
observable
that
tho
my
father
in
consequence
of
this
opinion
had
as
i
have
told
you
the
strongest
likings
and
dislikings
towards
certain
names
that
there
were
still
numbers
of
names
which
hung
so
equally
in
the
balance
before
him
that
they
were
absolutely
indifferent
to
him
jack
dick
and
tom
were
of
this
class
these
my
father
called
neutral
names
affirming
of
them
without
a
satire
that
there
had
been
as
many
knaves
and
fools
at
least
as
wise
and
good
men
since
the
world
began
who
had
indifferently
borne
them
so
that
like
equal
forces
acting
against
each
other
in
contrary
directions
he
thought
they
mutually
destroyed
each
other
effects
for
which
reason
he
would
often
declare
he
would
not
give
a
to
choose
amongst
them
bob
which
was
my
brother
name
was
another
of
these
neutral
kinds
of
christian
names
which
operated
very
little
either
way
and
as
my
father
happen
to
be
at
epsom
when
it
was
given
him
he
would
thank
heaven
it
was
no
worse
andrew
was
something
like
a
negative
quantity
in
algebra
with
him
was
worse
he
said
than
william
stood
pretty
high
numps
again
was
low
with
him
and
nick
he
said
was
the
devil
but
of
all
names
in
the
universe
he
had
the
most
unconquerable
aversion
for
tristram
he
had
the
lowest
and
most
contemptible
opinion
of
it
of
any
thing
in
the
world
thinking
it
could
possibly
produce
nothing
in
rerum
natura
but
what
was
extremely
mean
and
pitiful
so
that
in
the
midst
of
a
dispute
on
the
subject
in
which
by
the
bye
he
was
frequently
involved
he
would
sometimes
break
off
in
a
sudden
and
spirited
epiphonema
or
rather
erotesis
raised
a
third
and
sometimes
a
full
fifth
above
the
key
of
the
discourse
and
demand
it
categorically
of
his
antagonist
whether
he
would
take
upon
him
to
say
he
had
ever
remembered
whether
he
had
ever
read
or
even
whether
he
had
ever
heard
tell
of
a
man
called
tristram
performing
any
thing
great
or
worth
recording
no
he
would
say
tristram
the
thing
is
impossible
what
could
be
wanting
in
my
father
but
to
have
wrote
a
book
to
publish
this
notion
of
his
to
the
world
little
boots
it
to
the
subtle
speculatist
to
stand
single
in
his
opinions
unless
he
gives
them
proper
vent
it
was
the
identical
thing
which
my
father
did
for
in
the
year
sixteen
which
was
two
years
before
i
was
born
he
was
at
the
pains
of
writing
an
express
dissertation
simply
upon
the
word
tristram
shewing
the
world
with
great
candour
and
modesty
the
grounds
of
his
great
abhorrence
to
the
name
when
this
story
is
compared
with
the
will
not
the
gentle
reader
pity
my
father
from
his
soul
to
see
an
orderly
and
gentleman
who
tho
singular
yet
inoffensive
in
his
notions
so
played
upon
in
them
by
cross
purposes
to
look
down
upon
the
stage
and
see
him
baffled
and
overthrown
in
all
his
little
systems
and
wishes
to
behold
a
train
of
events
perpetually
falling
out
against
him
and
in
so
critical
and
cruel
a
way
as
if
they
had
purposedly
been
plann
and
pointed
against
him
merely
to
insult
his
in
a
word
to
behold
such
a
one
in
his
old
age
for
troubles
ten
times
in
a
day
suffering
sorrow
ten
times
in
a
day
calling
the
child
of
his
prayers
tristram
melancholy
dissyllable
of
sound
which
to
his
ears
was
unison
to
nincompoop
and
every
name
vituperative
under
by
his
ashes
i
swear
it
if
ever
malignant
spirit
took
pleasure
or
busied
itself
in
traversing
the
purposes
of
mortal
man
it
must
have
been
here
and
if
it
was
not
necessary
i
should
be
born
before
i
was
christened
i
would
this
moment
give
the
reader
an
account
of
it
chapter
how
could
you
madam
be
so
inattentive
in
reading
the
last
chapter
i
told
you
in
it
that
my
mother
was
not
a
papist
you
told
me
no
such
thing
madam
i
beg
leave
to
repeat
it
over
again
that
i
told
you
as
plain
at
least
as
words
by
direct
inference
could
tell
you
such
a
then
sir
i
must
have
miss
a
no
madam
you
have
not
miss
a
then
i
was
asleep
my
pride
madam
can
not
allow
you
that
then
i
declare
i
know
nothing
at
all
about
the
that
madam
is
the
very
fault
i
lay
to
your
charge
and
as
a
punishment
for
it
i
do
insist
upon
it
that
you
immediately
turn
back
that
is
as
soon
as
you
get
to
the
next
full
stop
and
read
the
whole
chapter
over
again
i
have
imposed
this
penance
upon
the
lady
neither
out
of
wantonness
nor
cruelty
but
from
the
best
of
motives
and
therefore
shall
make
her
no
apology
for
it
when
she
returns
back
is
to
rebuke
a
vicious
taste
which
has
crept
into
thousands
besides
herself
of
reading
straight
forwards
more
in
quest
of
the
adventures
than
of
the
deep
erudition
and
knowledge
which
a
book
of
this
cast
if
read
over
as
it
should
be
would
infallibly
impart
with
them
the
mind
should
be
accustomed
to
make
wise
reflections
and
draw
curious
conclusions
as
it
goes
along
the
habitude
of
which
made
pliny
the
younger
affirm
he
never
read
a
book
so
bad
but
he
drew
some
profit
from
it
the
stories
of
greece
and
rome
run
over
without
this
turn
and
application
do
less
service
i
affirm
it
than
the
history
of
parismus
and
parismenus
or
of
the
seven
champions
of
england
read
with
it
but
here
comes
my
fair
lady
have
you
read
over
again
the
chapter
madam
as
i
desired
you
you
have
and
did
you
not
observe
the
passage
upon
the
second
reading
which
admits
the
inference
not
a
word
like
it
then
madam
be
pleased
to
ponder
well
the
last
line
but
one
of
the
chapter
where
i
take
upon
me
to
say
was
necessary
i
should
be
born
before
i
was
christen
had
my
mother
madam
been
a
papist
that
consequence
did
not
follow
the
romish
rituals
direct
the
baptizing
of
the
child
in
cases
of
danger
before
it
is
born
but
upon
this
proviso
that
some
part
or
other
of
the
child
body
be
seen
by
the
baptizer
but
the
doctors
of
the
sorbonne
by
a
deliberation
held
amongst
them
april
have
enlarged
the
powers
of
the
midwives
by
determining
that
though
no
part
of
the
child
body
should
appear
that
baptism
shall
nevertheless
be
administered
to
it
by
injection

is
very
strange
that
thomas
aquinas
who
had
so
good
a
mechanical
head
both
for

untying

of

after
so
much

bestowed
upon

the
curiosity

the
question
upon
baptism
by
injection
as
presented
to
the
doctors
of
the
sorbonne
with
their
consultation
thereupon
it
is
as
follows
it
is
a
terrible
misfortune
for
this
same
book
of
mine
but
more
so
to
the
republick
of
letters
so
that
my
own
is
quite
swallowed
up
in
the
consideration
of
it
that
this
vile
pruriency
for
fresh
adventures
in
all
things
has
got
so
strongly
into
our
habit
and
humour
and
so
wholly
intent
are
we
upon
satisfying
the
impatience
of
our
concupiscence
that
way
that
nothing
but
the
gross
and
more
carnal
parts
of
a
composition
will
go
down
the
subtle
hints
and
sly
communications
of
science
fly
off
like
spirits
upwards
the
heavy
moral
escapes
downwards
and
both
the
one
and
the
other
are
as
much
lost
to
the

if
they
were
still
left
in

quaint

curious

it
may
have
its

that
all

i
wonder
what
all
that
noise
and
running
backwards
and
forwards
for
above
stairs
quoth
my
father
addressing
himself
after
an
hour
and
a
half
silence
to
my
uncle
toby
who
you
must
know
was
sitting
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
smoaking
his
social
pipe
all
the
time
in
mute
contemplation
of
a
new
pair
of
black
which
he
had
got
on
what
can
they
be
doing
brother
quoth
my
father
we
can
scarce
hear
ourselves
talk
i
think
replied
my
uncle
toby
taking
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
striking
the
head
of
it
two
or
three
times
upon
the
nail
of
his
left
thumb
as
he
began
his
sentence
i
think
says
he
but
to
enter
rightly
into
my
uncle
toby
sentiments
upon
this
matter
you
must
be
made
to
enter
first
a
little
into
his
character
the
of
which
i
shall
just
give
you
and
then
the
dialogue
between
him
and
my
father
will
go
on
as
well
again
pray
what
was
that
man
name
for
i
write
in
such
a
hurry
i
have
no
time
to
recollect
or
look
for
it
who
first
made
the
observation
there
was
great
inconstancy
in
our
air
and
climate
whoever
he
was
a
just
and
good
observation
in
but
the
corollary
drawn
from
it
namely
it
is
this
which
has
furnished
us
with
such
a
variety
of
odd
and
whimsical
characters
that
was
not
his
it
was
found
out
by
another
man
at
least
a
century
and
a
half
after
him
then
again
that
this
copious
of
original
materials
is
the
true
and
natural
cause
that
our
comedies
are
so
much
better
than
those
of
france
or
any
others
that
either
have
or
can
be
wrote
upon
the
continent
that
discovery
was
not
fully
made
till
about
the
middle
of
king
william
reign
when
the
great
dryden
in
writing
one
of
his
long
prefaces
if
i
mistake
not
most
fortunately
hit
upon
it
indeed
toward
the
latter
end
of
queen
anne
the
great
addison
began
to
patronize
the
notion
and
more
fully
explained
it
to
the
world
in
one
or
two
of
his
spectators
but
the
discovery
was
not
then
fourthly
and
lastly
that
this
strange
irregularity
in
our
climate
producing
so
strange
an
irregularity
in
our
characters
doth
thereby
in
some
sort
make
us
amends
by
giving
us
somewhat
to
make
us
merry
with
when
the
weather
will
not
suffer
us
to
go
out
of
doors
that
observation
is
my
own
and
was
struck
out
by
me
this
very
rainy
day
march
and
betwixt
the
hours
of
nine
and
ten
in
the
morning
thus
thus
my
and
associates
in
this
great
harvest
of
our
learning
now
ripening
before
our
eyes
thus
it
is
by
slow
steps
of
casual
increase
that
our
knowledge
physical
metaphysical
physiological
polemical
nautical
mathematical
aenigmatical
technical
biographical
romantical
chemical
and
obstetrical
with
fifty
other
branches
of
it
most
of
ending
as
these
do
in
ical
have
for
these
two
last
centuries
and
more
gradually
been
creeping
upwards
towards
that
akme
of
their
perfections
from
which
if
we
may
form
a
conjecture
from
the
advances
of
these
last
seven
years
we
can
not
possibly
be
far
off
when
that
happens
it
is
to
be
hoped
it
will
put
an
end
to
all
kind
of
writings
whatsoever
the
want
of
all
kind
of
writing
will
put
an
end
to
all
kind
of
reading
and
that
in
time
as
war
begets
poverty
poverty
peace
must
in
course
put
an
end
to
all
kind
of
knowledge
and
then
we
shall
have
all
to
begin
over
again
or
in
other
words
be
exactly
where
we
started
happy
thrice
happy
times
i
only
wish
that
the
aera
of
my
begetting
as
well
as
the
mode
and
manner
of
it
had
been
a
little
alter
or
that
it
could
have
been
put
off
with
any
convenience
to
my
father
or
mother
for
some
twenty
or
years
longer
when
a
man
in
the
literary
world
might
have
stood
some
but
i
forget
my
uncle
toby
whom
all
this
while
we
have
left
knocking
the
ashes
out
of
his
his
humour
was
of
that
particular
species
which
does
honour
to
our
atmosphere
and
i
should
have
made
no
scruple
of
ranking
him
amongst
one
of
the
productions
of
it
had
not
there
appeared
too
many
strong
lines
in
it
of
a
which
shewed
that
he
derived
the
singularity
of
his
temper
more
from
blood
than
either
wind
or
water
or
any
modifications
or
combinations
of
them
whatever
and
i
have
therefore
wondered
that
my
father
tho
i
believe
he
had
his
reasons
for
it
upon
his
observing
some
tokens
of
eccentricity
in
my
course
when
i
was
a
boy
should
never
once
endeavour
to
account
for
them
in
this
way
for
all
the
shandy
family
were
of
an
original
character
throughout
i
mean
the
males
the
females
had
no
character
at
all
except
indeed
my
great
aunt
dinah
who
about
sixty
years
ago
was
married
and
got
with
child
by
the
coachman
for
which
my
father
according
to
his
hypothesis
of
christian
names
would
often
say
she
might
thank
her
godfathers
and
godmothers
it
will
seem
strange
and
i
would
as
soon
think
of
dropping
a
riddle
in
the
reader
way
which
is
not
my
interest
to
do
as
set
him
upon
guessing
how
it
could
come
to
pass
that
an
event
of
this
kind
so
many
years
after
it
had
happened
should
be
reserved
for
the
interruption
of
the
peace
and
unity
which
otherwise
so
cordially
subsisted
between
my
father
and
my
uncle
toby
one
would
have
thought
that
the
whole
force
of
the
misfortune
should
have
spent
and
wasted
itself
in
the
family
at
first
as
is
generally
the
but
nothing
ever
wrought
with
our
family
after
the
ordinary
way
possibly
at
the
very
time
this
happened
it
might
have
something
else
to
afflict
it
and
as
afflictions
are
sent
down
for
our
good
and
that
as
this
had
never
done
the
shandy
family
any
good
at
all
it
might
lie
waiting
till
apt
times
and
circumstances
should
give
it
an
opportunity
to
discharge
its
observe
i
determine
nothing
upon
my
way
is
ever
to
point
out
to
the
curious
different
tracts
of
investigation
to
come
at
the
first
springs
of
the
events
i
tell
not
with
a
pedantic
fescue
or
in
the
decisive
manner
or
tacitus
who
outwits
himself
and
his
reader
but
with
the
officious
humility
of
a
heart
devoted
to
the
assistance
merely
of
the
inquisitive
to
them
i
write
and
by
them
i
shall
be
read
if
any
such
reading
as
this
could
be
supposed
to
hold
out
so
long
to
the
very
end
of
the
world
why
this
cause
of
sorrow
therefore
was
thus
reserved
for
my
father
and
uncle
is
undetermined
by
me
but
how
and
in
what
direction
it
exerted
itself
so
as
to
become
the
cause
of
dissatisfaction
between
them
after
it
began
to
operate
is
what
i
am
able
to
explain
with
great
exactness
and
is
as
follows
my
uncle
toby
shandy
madam
was
a
gentleman
who
with
the
virtues
which
usually
constitute
the
character
of
a
man
of
honour
and
rectitude
possessed
one
in
a
very
eminent
degree
which
is
seldom
or
never
put
into
the
catalogue
and
that
was
a
most
extreme
and
unparallel
modesty
of
nature
though
i
correct
the
word
nature
for
this
reason
that
i
may
not
prejudge
a
point
which
must
shortly
come
to
a
hearing
and
that
is
whether
this
modesty
of
his
was
natural
or
whichever
way
my
uncle
toby
came
by
it
was
nevertheless
modesty
in
the
truest
sense
of
it
and
that
is
madam
not
in
regard
to
words
for
he
was
so
unhappy
as
to
have
very
little
choice
in
them
but
to
things
and
this
kind
of
modesty
so
possessed
him
and
it
arose
to
such
a
height
in
him
as
almost
to
equal
if
such
a
thing
could
be
even
the
modesty
of
a
woman
that
female
nicety
madam
and
inward
cleanliness
of
mind
and
fancy
in
your
sex
which
makes
you
so
much
the
awe
of
ours
you
will
imagine
madam
that
my
uncle
toby
had
contracted
all
this
from
this
very
source
that
he
had
spent
a
great
part
of
his
time
in
converse
with
your
sex
and
that
from
a
thorough
knowledge
of
you
and
the
force
of
imitation
which
such
fair
examples
render
irresistible
he
had
acquired
this
amiable
turn
of
mind
i
wish
i
could
say
so
for
unless
it
was
with
his
my
father
wife
and
my
mother
my
uncle
toby
scarce
exchanged
three
words
with
the
sex
in
as
many
years
no
he
got
it
madam
by
a
a
blow
yes
madam
it
was
owing
to
a
blow
from
a
stone
broke
off
by
a
ball
from
the
parapet
of
a
at
the
siege
of
namur
which
struck
full
upon
my
uncle
toby
which
way
could
that
effect
it
the
story
of
that
madam
is
long
and
interesting
but
it
would
be
running
my
history
all
upon
heaps
to
give
it
you
is
for
an
episode
hereafter
and
every
circumstance
relating
to
it
in
its
proper
place
shall
be
faithfully
laid
before
you
then
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
give
farther
light
into
this
matter
or
say
more
than
what
i
have
said
already
that
my
uncle
toby
was
a
gentleman
of
modesty
which
happening
to
be
somewhat
subtilized
and
rarified
by
the
constant
heat
of
a
little
family
pride
they
both
so
wrought
together
within
him
that
he
could
never
bear
to
hear
the
affair
of
my
aunt
dinah
touch
upon
but
with
the
greatest
the
least
hint
of
it
was
enough
to
make
the
blood
fly
into
his
face
but
when
my
father
enlarged
upon
the
story
in
mixed
companies
which
the
illustration
of
his
hypothesis
frequently
obliged
him
to
do
the
unfortunate
blight
of
one
of
the
fairest
branches
of
the
family
would
set
my
uncle
toby
honour
and
modesty
and
he
would
often
take
my
father
aside
in
the
greatest
concern
imaginable
to
expostulate
and
tell
him
he
would
give
him
any
thing
in
the
world
only
to
let
the
story
rest
my
father
i
believe
had
the
truest
love
and
tenderness
for
my
uncle
toby
that
ever
one
brother
bore
towards
another
and
would
have
done
any
thing
in
nature
which
one
brother
in
reason
could
have
desir
of
another
to
have
made
my
uncle
toby
heart
easy
in
this
or
any
other
point
but
this
lay
out
of
his
power
my
father
as
i
told
you
was
a
philosopher
in
grain
speculative
systematical
and
my
aunt
dinah
affair
was
a
matter
of
as
much
consequence
to
him
as
the
retrogradation
of
the
planets
to
copernicus
the
backslidings
of
venus
in
her
orbit
fortified
the
copernican
system
called
so
after
his
name
and
the
backslidings
of
my
aunt
dinah
in
her
orbit
did
the
same
service
in
establishing
my
father
system
which
i
trust
will
for
ever
hereafter
be
called
the
shandean
system
after
his
in
any
other
family
dishonour
my
father
i
believe
had
as
nice
a
sense
of
shame
as
any
man
whatever
and
neither
he
nor
i
dare
say
copernicus
would
have
divulged
the
affair
in
either
case
or
have
taken
the
least
notice
of
it
to
the
world
but
for
the
obligations
they
owed
as
they
thought
to
amicus
plato
my
father
would
say
construing
the
words
to
my
uncle
toby
as
he
went
along
amicus
plato
that
is
dinah
was
my
aunt
sed
magis
amica
veritas
but
truth
is
my
sister
this
contrariety
of
humours
betwixt
my
father
and
my
uncle
was
the
source
of
many
a
fraternal
squabble
the
one
could
not
bear
to
hear
the
tale
of
family
disgrace
recorded
and
the
other
would
scarce
ever
let
a
day
pass
to
an
end
without
some
hint
at
it
for
god
sake
my
uncle
toby
would
cry
and
for
my
sake
and
for
all
our
sakes
my
dear
brother
shandy
do
let
this
story
of
our
and
her
ashes
sleep
in
peace
how
can
you
how
can
you
have
so
little
feeling
and
compassion
for
the
character
of
our
family
what
is
the
character
of
a
family
to
an
hypothesis
my
father
would
nay
if
you
come
to
that
what
is
the
life
of
a
family
the
life
of
a
family
my
uncle
toby
would
say
throwing
himself
back
in
his
arm
chair
and
lifting
up
his
hands
his
eyes
and
one
leg
yes
the
life
my
father
would
say
maintaining
his
point
how
many
thousands
of
are
there
every
year
that
come
cast
away
in
all
civilized
countries
at
least
and
considered
as
nothing
but
common
air
in
competition
of
an
hypothesis
in
my
plain
sense
of
things
my
uncle
toby
would
answer
every
such
instance
is
downright
murder
let
who
will
commit
there
lies
your
mistake
my
father
would
reply
for
in
foro
scientiae
there
is
no
such
thing
as
murder
is
only
death
brother
my
uncle
toby
would
never
offer
to
answer
this
by
any
other
kind
of
argument
than
that
of
whistling
half
a
dozen
bars
of
you
must
know
it
was
the
usual
channel
thro
which
his
passions
got
vent
when
any
thing
shocked
or
surprized
him
but
especially
when
any
thing
which
he
deem
very
absurd
was
offered
as
not
one
of
our
logical
writers
nor
any
of
the
commentators
upon
them
that
i
remember
have
thought
proper
to
give
a
name
to
this
particular
species
of
i
here
take
the
liberty
to
do
it
myself
for
two
reasons
first
that
in
order
to
prevent
all
confusion
in
disputes
it
may
stand
as
much
distinguished
for
ever
from
every
other
species
of
argument
as
the
argumentum
ad
verecundiam
ex
absurdo
ex
fortiori
or
any
other
argument
whatsoever
and
secondly
that
it
may
be
said
by
my
children
children
when
my
head
is
laid
to
rest
that
their
learn
grandfather
head
had
been
busied
to
as
much
purpose
once
as
other
people
that
he
had
invented
a
name
and
generously
thrown
it
into
the
treasury
of
the
ars
logica
for
one
of
the
most
unanswerable
arguments
in
the
whole
science
and
if
the
end
of
disputation
is
more
to
silence
than
convince
they
may
add
if
they
please
to
one
of
the
best
arguments
too
i
do
therefore
by
these
presents
strictly
order
and
command
that
it
be
known
and
distinguished
by
the
name
and
title
of
the
argumentum
fistulatorium
and
no
other
and
that
it
rank
hereafter
with
the
argumentum
baculinum
and
the
argumentum
ad
crumenam
and
for
ever
hereafter
be
treated
of
in
the
same
chapter
as
for
the
argumentum
tripodium
which
is
never
used
but
by
the
woman
against
the
man
and
the
argumentum
ad
rem
which
contrarywise
is
made
use
of
by
the
man
only
against
the
woman
as
these
two
are
enough
in
conscience
for
one
lecture
and
moreover
as
the
one
is
the
best
answer
to
the
other
let
them
likewise
be
kept
apart
and
be
treated
of
in
a
place
by
themselves
chapter
the
learned
bishop
hall
i
mean
the
famous
joseph
hall
who
was
bishop
of
exeter
in
king
james
the
first
reign
tells
us
in
one
of
decads
at
the
end
of
his
divine
art
of
meditation
imprinted
at
london
in
the
year
by
john
beal
dwelling
in
it
is
an
abominable
thing
for
a
man
to
commend
himself
and
i
really
think
it
is
so
and
yet
on
the
other
hand
when
a
thing
is
executed
in
a
masterly
kind
of
a
fashion
which
thing
is
not
likely
to
be
found
out
i
think
it
is
full
as
abominable
that
a
man
should
lose
the
honour
of
it
and
go
out
of
the
world
with
the
conceit
of
it
rotting
in
his
head
this
is
precisely
my
situation
for
in
this
long
digression
which
i
was
accidentally
led
into
as
in
all
my
digressions
one
only
excepted
there
is
a
of
digressive
skill
the
merit
of
which
has
all
along
i
fear
been
by
my
reader
not
for
want
of
penetration
in
him
but
because
is
an
excellence
seldom
looked
for
or
expected
indeed
in
a
digression
and
it
is
this
that
tho
my
digressions
are
all
fair
as
you
observe
and
that
i
fly
off
from
what
i
am
about
as
far
and
as
often
too
as
any
writer
in
great
britain
yet
i
constantly
take
care
to
order
affairs
so
that
my
main
business
does
not
stand
still
in
my
absence
i
was
just
going
for
example
to
have
given
you
the
great
of
my
uncle
toby
most
whimsical
character
when
my
aunt
dinah
and
the
coachman
came
across
us
and
led
us
a
vagary
some
millions
of
miles
into
the
very
heart
of
the
planetary
system
notwithstanding
all
this
you
perceive
that
the
drawing
of
my
uncle
toby
character
went
on
gently
all
the
time
not
the
great
contours
of
it
that
was
impossible
but
some
familiar
strokes
and
faint
designations
of
it
were
here
and
there
touch
on
as
we
went
along
so
that
you
are
much
better
acquainted
with
my
uncle
toby
now
than
you
was
before
by
this
contrivance
the
machinery
of
my
work
is
of
a
species
by
itself
two
contrary
motions
are
introduced
into
it
and
reconciled
which
were
thought
to
be
at
variance
with
each
other
in
a
word
my
work
is
digressive
and
it
is
progressive
too
and
at
the
same
time
this
sir
is
a
very
different
story
from
that
of
the
earth
moving
round
her
axis
in
her
diurnal
rotation
with
her
progress
in
her
elliptick
orbit
which
brings
about
the
year
and
constitutes
that
variety
and
vicissitude
of
seasons
we
enjoy
though
i
own
it
suggested
the
thought
as
i
believe
the
greatest
of
our
boasted
improvements
and
discoveries
have
come
from
such
trifling
hints
digressions
incontestably
are
the
sunshine
they
are
the
life
the
soul
of
reading
take
them
out
of
this
book
for
instance
you
might
as
well
take
the
book
along
with
them
one
cold
eternal
winter
would
reign
in
every
page
of
it
restore
them
to
the
writer
he
steps
forth
like
a
bridegroom
bids
brings
in
variety
and
forbids
the
appetite
to
fail
all
the
dexterity
is
in
the
good
cookery
and
management
of
them
so
as
to
be
not
only
for
the
advantage
of
the
reader
but
also
of
the
author
whose
distress
in
this
matter
is
truly
pitiable
for
if
he
begins
a
digression
from
that
moment
i
observe
his
whole
work
stands
stock
still
and
if
he
goes
on
with
his
main
work
then
there
is
an
end
of
his
digression
this
is
vile
for
which
reason
from
the
beginning
of
this
you
see
i
have
constructed
the
main
work
and
the
adventitious
parts
of
it
with
such
intersections
and
have
so
complicated
and
involved
the
digressive
and
progressive
movements
one
wheel
within
another
that
the
whole
machine
in
general
has
been
kept
and
what
more
it
shall
be
kept
these
forty
years
if
it
pleases
the
fountain
of
health
to
bless
me
so
long
with
life
and
good
spirits
chapter
i
have
a
strong
propensity
in
me
to
begin
this
chapter
very
nonsensically
and
i
will
not
balk
my
accordingly
i
set
off
thus
if
the
fixture
of
momus
glass
in
the
human
breast
according
to
the
proposed
emendation
of
that
had
taken
place
first
this
foolish
consequence
would
certainly
have
followed
that
the
very
wisest
and
very
gravest
of
us
all
in
one
coin
or
other
must
have
paid
every
day
of
our
lives
and
secondly
that
had
the
said
glass
been
there
set
up
nothing
more
would
have
been
wanting
in
order
to
have
taken
a
man
character
but
to
have
taken
a
chair
and
gone
softly
as
you
would
to
a
dioptrical
and
look
in
view
the
soul
stark
naked
observed
all
her
motions
her
machinations
traced
all
her
maggots
from
their
first
engendering
to
their
crawling
forth
watched
her
loose
in
her
frisks
her
gambols
her
capricios
and
after
some
notice
of
her
more
solemn
deportment
consequent
upon
such
frisks
then
taken
your
pen
and
ink
and
set
down
nothing
but
what
you
had
seen
and
could
have
sworn
to
but
this
is
an
advantage
not
to
be
had
by
the
biographer
in
this
planet
in
the
planet
mercury
belike
it
may
be
so
if
not
better
still
for
him
for
there
the
intense
heat
of
the
country
which
is
proved
by
computators
from
its
vicinity
to
the
sun
to
be
more
than
equal
to
that
of
iron
must
i
think
long
ago
have
vitrified
the
bodies
of
the
inhabitants
as
the
efficient
cause
to
suit
them
for
the
climate
which
is
the
final
cause
so
that
betwixt
them
both
all
the
tenements
of
their
souls
from
top
to
bottom
may
be
nothing
else
for
aught
the
soundest
philosophy
can
shew
to
the
contrary
but
one
fine
transparent
body
of
clear
glass
bating
the
umbilical
knot
so
that
till
the
inhabitants
grow
old
and
tolerably
wrinkled
whereby
the
rays
of
light
in
passing
through
them
become
so
monstrously
refracted
or
return
reflected
from
their
surfaces
in
such
transverse
lines
to
the
eye
that
a
man
can
not
be
seen
through
his
soul
might
as
well
unless
for
mere
ceremony
or
the
trifling
advantage
which
the
umbilical
point
gave
her
might
upon
all
other
accounts
i
say
as
well
play
the
fool
out
as
in
her
own
house
but
this
as
i
said
above
is
not
the
case
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
earth
our
minds
shine
not
through
the
body
but
are
wrapt
up
here
in
a
dark
covering
of
uncrystalized
flesh
and
blood
so
that
if
we
would
come
to
the
specific
characters
of
them
we
must
go
some
other
way
to
work
many
in
good
truth
are
the
ways
which
human
wit
has
been
forced
to
take
to
do
this
thing
with
exactness
some
for
instance
draw
all
their
characters
with
virgil
takes
notice
of
that
way
in
the
affair
of
dido
and
aeneas
but
it
is
as
fallacious
as
the
breath
of
fame
and
moreover
bespeaks
a
narrow
genius
i
am
not
ignorant
that
the
italians
pretend
to
a
mathematical
exactness
in
their
designations
of
one
particular
sort
of
character
among
them
from
the
forte
or
piano
of
a
certain
they
use
which
they
say
is
i
dare
not
mention
the
name
of
the
instrument
in
this
place
is
sufficient
we
have
it
amongst
us
but
never
think
of
making
a
drawing
by
it
this
is
aenigmatical
and
intended
to
be
so
at
least
ad
populum
and
therefore
i
beg
madam
when
you
come
here
that
you
read
on
as
fast
as
you
can
and
never
stop
to
make
any
inquiry
about
it
there
are
others
again
who
will
draw
a
man
character
from
no
other
helps
in
the
world
but
merely
from
his
evacuations
but
this
often
gives
a
very
incorrect
outline
unless
indeed
you
take
a
sketch
of
his
repletions
too
and
by
correcting
one
drawing
from
the
other
compound
one
good
figure
out
of
them
both
i
should
have
no
objection
to
this
method
but
that
i
think
it
must
smell
too
strong
of
the
lamp
and
be
render
still
more
operose
by
forcing
you
to
have
an
eye
to
the
rest
of
his
why
the
most
natural
actions
of
a
man
life
should
be
called
his
is
another
question
there
are
others
fourthly
who
disdain
every
one
of
these
expedients
not
from
any
fertility
of
their
own
but
from
the
various
ways
of
doing
it
which
they
have
borrowed
from
the
honourable
devices
which
the
pentagraphic
brethren
pentagraph
an
instrument
to
copy
prints
and
pictures
mechanically
and
in
any
proportion
of
the
brush
have
shewn
in
taking
these
you
must
know
are
your
great
historians
one
of
these
you
will
see
drawing
a
full
length
character
against
the
light
that
illiberal
dishonest
and
hard
upon
the
character
of
the
man
who
sits
others
to
mend
the
matter
will
make
a
drawing
of
you
in
the
camera
that
is
most
unfair
of
all
because
there
you
are
sure
to
be
represented
in
some
of
your
most
ridiculous
attitudes
to
avoid
all
and
every
one
of
these
errors
in
giving
you
my
uncle
toby
character
i
am
determined
to
draw
it
by
no
mechanical
help
whatever
nor
shall
my
pencil
be
guided
by
any
one
which
ever
was
blown
upon
either
on
this
or
on
the
other
side
of
the
alps
nor
will
i
consider
either
his
repletions
or
his
discharges
or
touch
upon
his
but
in
a
word
i
will
draw
my
uncle
character
from
his
chapter
if
i
was
not
morally
sure
that
the
reader
must
be
out
of
all
patience
for
my
uncle
toby
character
i
would
here
previously
have
convinced
him
that
there
is
no
instrument
so
fit
to
draw
such
a
thing
with
as
that
which
i
have
pitch
upon
a
man
and
his
tho
i
can
not
say
that
they
act
and
exactly
after
the
same
manner
in
which
the
soul
and
body
do
upon
each
other
yet
doubtless
there
is
a
communication
between
them
of
some
kind
and
my
opinion
rather
is
that
there
is
something
in
it
more
of
the
manner
of
electrified
bodies
and
that
by
means
of
the
heated
parts
of
the
rider
which
come
immediately
into
contact
with
the
back
of
the
by
long
journies
and
much
friction
it
so
happens
that
the
body
of
the
rider
is
at
length
fill
as
full
of
matter
as
it
can
hold
so
that
if
you
are
able
to
give
but
a
clear
description
of
the
nature
of
the
one
you
may
form
a
pretty
exact
notion
of
the
genius
and
character
of
the
other
now
the
which
my
uncle
toby
always
rode
upon
was
in
my
opinion
an
well
worth
giving
a
description
of
if
it
was
only
upon
the
score
of
his
great
singularity
for
you
might
have
travelled
from
york
to
dover
from
dover
to
penzance
in
cornwall
and
from
penzance
to
york
back
again
and
not
have
seen
such
another
upon
the
road
or
if
you
had
seen
such
a
one
whatever
haste
you
had
been
in
you
must
infallibly
have
stopp
to
have
taken
a
view
of
him
indeed
the
gait
and
figure
of
him
was
so
strange
and
so
utterly
unlike
was
he
from
his
head
to
his
tail
to
any
one
of
the
whole
species
that
it
was
now
and
then
made
a
matter
of
dispute
whether
he
was
really
a
or
no
but
as
the
philosopher
would
use
no
other
argument
to
the
sceptic
who
disputed
with
him
against
the
reality
of
motion
save
that
of
rising
up
upon
his
legs
and
walking
across
the
room
so
would
my
uncle
toby
use
no
other
argument
to
prove
his
was
a
indeed
but
by
getting
upon
his
back
and
riding
him
about
leaving
the
world
after
that
to
determine
the
point
as
it
thought
fit
in
good
truth
my
uncle
toby
mounted
him
with
so
much
pleasure
and
he
carried
my
uncle
toby
so
well
that
he
troubled
his
head
very
little
with
what
the
world
either
said
or
thought
about
it
it
is
now
high
time
however
that
i
give
you
a
description
of
him
but
to
go
on
regularly
i
only
beg
you
will
give
me
leave
to
acquaint
you
first
how
my
uncle
toby
came
by
him
chapter
the
wound
in
my
uncle
toby
groin
which
he
received
at
the
siege
of
namur
rendering
him
unfit
for
the
service
it
was
thought
expedient
he
should
return
to
england
in
order
if
possible
to
be
set
to
rights
he
was
four
years
totally
confined
part
of
it
to
his
bed
and
all
of
it
to
his
room
and
in
the
course
of
his
cure
which
was
all
that
time
in
hand
suffer
unspeakable
miseries
owing
to
a
succession
of
exfoliations
from
the
os
pubis
and
the
outward
edge
of
that
part
of
the
coxendix
called
the
os
illium
both
which
bones
were
dismally
crush
as
much
by
the
irregularity
of
the
stone
which
i
told
you
was
broke
off
the
parapet
as
by
its
size
tho
it
was
pretty
large
which
inclined
the
surgeon
all
along
to
think
that
the
great
injury
which
it
had
done
my
uncle
toby
groin
was
more
owing
to
the
gravity
of
the
stone
itself
than
to
the
projectile
force
of
it
which
he
would
often
tell
him
was
a
great
happiness
my
father
at
that
time
was
just
beginning
business
in
london
and
had
taken
a
house
and
as
the
truest
friendship
and
cordiality
subsisted
between
the
two
brothers
and
that
my
father
thought
my
uncle
toby
could
no
where
be
so
well
nursed
and
taken
care
of
as
in
his
own
house
he
assign
him
the
very
best
apartment
in
and
what
was
a
much
more
sincere
mark
of
his
affection
still
he
would
never
suffer
a
friend
or
an
acquaintance
to
step
into
the
house
on
any
occasion
but
he
would
take
him
by
the
hand
and
lead
him
up
stairs
to
see
his
brother
toby
and
chat
an
hour
by
his
the
history
of
a
soldier
wound
beguiles
the
pain
of
it
my
visitors
at
least
thought
so
and
in
their
daily
calls
upon
him
from
the
courtesy
arising
out
of
that
belief
they
would
frequently
turn
the
discourse
to
that
subject
and
from
that
subject
the
discourse
would
generally
roll
on
to
the
siege
itself
these
conversations
were
infinitely
kind
and
my
uncle
toby
received
great
relief
from
them
and
would
have
received
much
more
but
that
they
brought
him
into
some
unforeseen
perplexities
which
for
three
months
together
retarded
his
cure
greatly
and
if
he
had
not
hit
upon
an
expedient
to
extricate
himself
out
of
them
i
verily
believe
they
would
have
laid
him
in
his
grave
what
these
perplexities
of
my
uncle
toby
were
is
impossible
for
you
to
guess
if
you
could
i
should
blush
not
as
a
relation
not
as
a
man
nor
even
as
a
woman
but
i
should
blush
as
an
author
inasmuch
as
i
set
no
small
store
by
myself
upon
this
very
account
that
my
reader
has
never
yet
been
able
to
guess
at
any
thing
and
in
this
sir
i
am
of
so
nice
and
singular
a
humour
that
if
i
thought
you
was
able
to
form
the
least
judgment
or
probable
conjecture
to
yourself
of
what
was
to
come
in
the
next
page
i
would
tear
it
out
of
my
book
chapter
i
have
begun
a
new
book
on
purpose
that
i
might
have
room
enough
to
explain
the
nature
of
the
perplexities
in
which
my
uncle
toby
was
involved
from
the
many
discourses
and
interrogations
about
the
siege
of
namur
where
he
received
his
wound
i
must
remind
the
reader
in
case
he
has
read
the
history
of
king
william
wars
but
if
he
has
not
i
then
inform
him
that
one
of
the
most
memorable
attacks
in
that
siege
was
that
which
was
made
by
the
english
and
dutch
upon
the
point
of
the
advanced
counterscarp
between
the
gate
of
nicolas
which
inclosed
the
great
sluice
or
where
the
english
were
terribly
exposed
to
the
shot
of
the
and
of
roch
the
issue
of
which
hot
dispute
in
three
words
was
this
that
the
dutch
lodged
themselves
upon
the
and
that
the
english
made
themselves
masters
of
the
before
notwithstanding
the
gallantry
of
the
french
officers
who
exposed
themselves
upon
the
glacis
sword
in
hand
as
this
was
the
principal
attack
of
which
my
uncle
toby
was
an
at
namur
the
army
of
the
besiegers
being
cut
off
by
the
confluence
of
the
maes
and
sambre
from
seeing
much
of
each
operations
my
uncle
toby
was
generally
more
eloquent
and
particular
in
his
account
of
it
and
the
many
perplexities
he
was
in
arose
out
of
the
almost
insurmountable
difficulties
he
found
in
telling
his
story
intelligibly
and
giving
such
clear
ideas
of
the
differences
and
distinctions
between
the
scarp
and
counterscarp
the
glacis
and
the
and
ravelin
as
to
make
his
company
fully
comprehend
where
and
what
he
was
about
writers
themselves
are
too
apt
to
confound
these
terms
so
that
you
will
the
less
wonder
if
in
his
endeavours
to
explain
them
and
in
opposition
to
many
misconceptions
that
my
uncle
toby
did
puzzle
his
visitors
and
sometimes
himself
too
to
speak
the
truth
unless
the
company
my
father
led
up
stairs
were
tolerably
or
my
uncle
toby
was
in
one
of
his
explanatory
moods
was
a
difficult
thing
do
what
he
could
to
keep
the
discourse
free
from
obscurity
what
rendered
the
account
of
this
affair
the
more
intricate
to
my
uncle
toby
was
this
that
in
the
attack
of
the
counterscarp
before
the
gate
of
nicolas
extending
itself
from
the
bank
of
the
maes
quite
up
to
the
great
the
ground
was
cut
and
cross
cut
with
such
a
multitude
of
dykes
drains
rivulets
and
sluices
on
all
sides
and
he
would
get
so
sadly
bewildered
and
set
fast
amongst
them
that
frequently
he
could
neither
get
backwards
or
forwards
to
save
his
life
and
was
obliged
to
give
up
the
attack
upon
that
very
account
only
these
perplexing
rebuffs
gave
my
uncle
toby
shandy
more
perturbations
than
you
would
imagine
and
as
my
father
kindness
to
him
was
continually
dragging
up
fresh
friends
and
fresh
enquirers
he
had
but
a
very
uneasy
task
of
it
no
doubt
my
uncle
toby
had
great
command
of
himself
and
could
guard
appearances
i
believe
as
well
as
most
men
yet
any
one
may
imagine
that
when
he
could
not
retreat
out
of
the
ravelin
without
getting
into
the
or
get
out
of
the
without
falling
down
the
counterscarp
nor
cross
the
dyke
without
danger
of
slipping
into
the
ditch
but
that
he
must
have
fretted
and
fumed
inwardly
he
did
so
and
the
little
and
hourly
vexations
which
may
seem
trifling
and
of
no
account
to
the
man
who
has
not
read
hippocrates
yet
whoever
has
read
hippocrates
or
james
mackenzie
and
has
considered
well
the
effects
which
the
passions
and
affections
of
the
mind
have
upon
the
digestion
why
not
of
a
wound
as
well
as
of
a
dinner
may
easily
conceive
what
sharp
paroxysms
and
exacerbations
of
his
wound
my
uncle
toby
must
have
undergone
upon
that
score
only
my
uncle
toby
could
not
philosophize
upon
it
was
enough
he
felt
it
was
so
and
having
sustained
the
pain
and
sorrows
of
it
for
three
months
together
he
was
resolved
some
way
or
other
to
extricate
himself
he
was
one
morning
lying
upon
his
back
in
his
bed
the
anguish
and
nature
of
the
wound
upon
his
groin
suffering
him
to
lie
in
no
other
position
when
a
thought
came
into
his
head
that
if
he
could
purchase
such
a
thing
and
have
it
pasted
down
upon
a
board
as
a
large
map
of
the
fortification
of
the
town
and
citadel
of
namur
with
its
environs
it
might
be
a
means
of
giving
him
i
take
notice
of
his
desire
to
have
the
environs
along
with
the
town
and
citadel
for
this
reason
because
my
uncle
toby
wound
was
got
in
one
of
the
traverses
about
thirty
toises
from
the
returning
angle
of
the
trench
opposite
to
the
salient
angle
of
the
of
roch
so
that
he
was
pretty
confident
he
could
stick
a
pin
upon
the
identical
spot
of
ground
where
he
was
standing
on
when
the
stone
struck
him
all
this
succeeded
to
his
wishes
and
not
only
freed
him
from
a
world
of
sad
explanations
but
in
the
end
it
proved
the
happy
means
as
you
will
read
of
procuring
my
uncle
toby
his
chapter
there
is
nothing
so
foolish
when
you
are
at
the
expence
of
making
an
entertainment
of
this
kind
as
to
order
things
so
badly
as
to
let
your
criticks
and
gentry
of
refined
taste
run
it
down
nor
is
there
any
thing
so
likely
to
make
them
do
it
as
that
of
leaving
them
out
of
the
party
or
what
is
full
as
offensive
of
bestowing
your
attention
upon
the
rest
of
your
guests
in
so
particular
a
way
as
if
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
critick
by
occupation
at
table
i
guard
against
both
for
in
the
first
place
i
have
left
half
a
dozen
places
purposely
open
for
them
and
in
the
next
place
i
pay
them
all
gentlemen
i
kiss
your
hands
i
protest
no
company
could
give
me
half
the
pleasure
by
my
soul
i
am
glad
to
see
you
i
beg
only
you
will
make
no
strangers
of
yourselves
but
sit
down
without
any
ceremony
and
fall
on
heartily
i
said
i
had
left
six
places
and
i
was
upon
the
point
of
carrying
my
complaisance
so
far
as
to
have
left
a
seventh
open
for
them
and
in
this
very
spot
i
stand
on
but
being
told
by
a
critick
tho
not
by
occupation
but
by
nature
that
i
had
acquitted
myself
well
enough
i
shall
fill
it
up
directly
hoping
in
the
mean
time
that
i
shall
be
able
to
make
a
great
deal
of
more
room
next
year
how
in
the
name
of
wonder
could
your
uncle
toby
who
it
seems
was
a
military
man
and
whom
you
have
represented
as
no
fool
be
at
the
same
time
such
a
confused
fellow
as
go
look
so
sir
critick
i
could
have
replied
but
i
scorn
is
language
unurbane
and
only
befitting
the
man
who
can
not
give
clear
and
satisfactory
accounts
of
things
or
dive
deep
enough
into
the
first
causes
of
human
ignorance
and
confusion
it
is
moreover
the
reply
valiant
and
therefore
i
reject
it
for
tho
it
might
have
suited
my
uncle
toby
character
as
a
soldier
excellently
well
and
had
he
not
accustomed
himself
in
such
attacks
to
whistle
the
lillabullero
as
he
wanted
no
courage
is
the
very
answer
he
would
have
given
yet
it
would
by
no
means
have
done
for
me
you
see
as
plain
as
can
be
that
i
write
as
a
man
of
erudition
that
even
my
similies
my
allusions
my
illustrations
my
metaphors
are
erudite
and
that
i
must
sustain
my
character
properly
and
contrast
it
properly
too
else
what
would
become
of
me
why
sir
i
should
be
undone
at
this
very
moment
that
i
am
going
here
to
fill
up
one
place
against
a
critick
i
should
have
made
an
opening
for
a
couple
therefore
i
answer
thus
pray
sir
in
all
the
reading
which
you
have
ever
read
did
you
ever
read
such
a
book
as
locke
essay
upon
the
human
understanding
answer
me
rashly
because
many
i
know
quote
the
book
who
have
not
read
it
and
many
have
read
it
who
understand
it
not
if
either
of
these
is
your
case
as
i
write
to
instruct
i
will
tell
you
in
three
words
what
the
book
it
is
a
a
history
of
who
what
where
when
do
hurry
yourself
it
is
a
sir
which
may
possibly
recommend
it
to
the
world
of
what
passes
in
a
man
own
mind
and
if
you
will
say
so
much
of
the
book
and
no
more
believe
me
you
will
cut
no
contemptible
figure
in
a
metaphysick
circle
but
this
by
the
way
now
if
you
will
venture
to
go
along
with
me
and
look
down
into
the
bottom
of
this
matter
it
will
be
found
that
the
cause
of
obscurity
and
confusion
in
the
mind
of
a
man
is
threefold
dull
organs
dear
sir
in
the
first
place
secondly
slight
and
transient
impressions
made
by
the
objects
when
the
said
organs
are
not
dull
and
thirdly
a
memory
like
unto
a
sieve
not
able
to
retain
what
it
has
call
down
dolly
your
and
i
will
give
you
my
cap
and
bell
along
with
it
if
i
make
not
this
matter
so
plain
that
dolly
herself
should
understand
it
as
well
as
when
dolly
has
indited
her
epistle
to
robin
and
has
thrust
her
arm
into
the
bottom
of
her
pocket
hanging
by
her
right
side
take
that
opportunity
to
recollect
that
the
organs
and
faculties
of
perception
can
by
nothing
in
this
world
be
so
aptly
typified
and
explained
as
by
that
one
thing
which
dolly
hand
is
in
search
your
organs
are
not
so
dull
that
i
should
inform
you
is
an
inch
sir
of
red
when
this
is
melted
and
dropped
upon
the
letter
if
dolly
fumbles
too
long
for
her
thimble
till
the
wax
is
over
hardened
it
will
not
receive
the
mark
of
her
thimble
from
the
usual
impulse
which
was
wont
to
imprint
it
very
well
if
dolly
wax
for
want
of
better
is
or
of
a
temper
too
soft
tho
it
may
receive
it
will
not
hold
the
impression
how
hard
soever
dolly
thrusts
against
it
and
last
of
all
supposing
the
wax
good
and
eke
the
thimble
but
applied
thereto
in
careless
haste
as
her
mistress
rings
the
bell
in
any
one
of
these
three
cases
the
print
left
by
the
thimble
will
be
as
unlike
the
prototype
as
a
now
you
must
understand
that
not
one
of
these
was
the
true
cause
of
the
confusion
in
my
uncle
toby
discourse
and
it
is
for
that
very
reason
i
enlarge
upon
them
so
long
after
the
manner
of
great
physiologists
to
shew
the
world
what
it
did
not
arise
from
what
it
did
arise
from
i
have
hinted
above
and
a
fertile
source
of
obscurity
it
is
and
ever
will
be
and
that
is
the
unsteady
uses
of
words
which
have
perplexed
the
clearest
and
most
exalted
understandings
it
is
ten
to
one
at
arthur
whether
you
have
ever
read
the
literary
histories
of
past
ages
if
you
have
what
terrible
battles
logomachies
have
they
occasioned
and
perpetuated
with
so
much
gall
and
that
a
man
can
not
read
the
accounts
of
them
without
tears
in
his
eyes
gentle
critick
when
thou
hast
weighed
all
this
and
considered
within
thyself
how
much
of
thy
own
knowledge
discourse
and
conversation
has
been
pestered
and
disordered
at
one
time
or
other
by
this
and
this
only
what
a
pudder
and
racket
in
councils
about
greek
and
in
the
schools
of
the
learned
about
power
and
about
spirit
about
essences
and
about
quintessences
about
substances
and
about
what
confusion
in
greater
theatres
from
words
of
little
meaning
and
as
indeterminate
a
sense
when
thou
considerest
this
thou
wilt
not
wonder
at
my
uncle
toby
perplexities
thou
wilt
drop
a
tear
of
pity
upon
his
scarp
and
his
counterscarp
his
glacis
and
his
covered
way
his
ravelin
and
his
was
not
by
ideas
by
heaven
his
life
was
put
in
jeopardy
by
words
chapter
when
my
uncle
toby
got
his
map
of
namur
to
his
mind
he
began
immediately
to
apply
himself
and
with
the
utmost
diligence
to
the
study
of
it
for
nothing
being
of
more
importance
to
him
than
his
recovery
and
his
recovery
depending
as
you
have
read
upon
the
passions
and
affections
of
his
mind
it
behoved
him
to
take
the
nicest
care
to
make
himself
so
far
master
of
his
subject
as
to
be
able
to
talk
upon
it
without
emotion
in
a
fortnight
close
and
painful
application
which
by
the
bye
did
my
uncle
toby
wound
upon
his
groin
no
good
he
was
enabled
by
the
help
of
some
marginal
documents
at
the
feet
of
the
elephant
together
with
gobesius
military
architecture
and
pyroballogy
translated
from
the
flemish
to
form
his
discourse
with
passable
perspicuity
and
before
he
was
two
full
months
gone
he
was
right
eloquent
upon
it
and
could
make
not
only
the
attack
of
the
advanced
counterscarp
with
great
order
but
having
by
that
time
gone
much
deeper
into
the
art
than
what
his
first
motive
made
necessary
my
uncle
toby
was
able
to
cross
the
maes
and
sambre
make
diversions
as
far
as
vauban
line
the
abbey
of
salsines
and
give
his
visitors
as
distinct
a
history
of
each
of
their
attacks
as
of
that
of
the
gate
of
nicolas
where
he
had
the
honour
to
receive
his
wound
but
desire
of
knowledge
like
the
thirst
of
riches
increases
ever
with
the
acquisition
of
it
the
more
my
uncle
toby
pored
over
his
map
the
more
he
took
a
liking
to
it
by
the
same
process
and
electrical
assimilation
as
i
told
you
through
which
i
ween
the
souls
of
connoisseurs
themselves
by
long
friction
and
incumbition
have
the
happiness
at
length
to
get
all
butterflied
and
the
more
my
uncle
toby
drank
of
this
sweet
fountain
of
science
the
greater
was
the
heat
and
impatience
of
his
thirst
so
that
before
the
first
year
of
his
confinement
had
well
gone
round
there
was
scarce
a
fortified
town
in
italy
or
flanders
of
which
by
one
means
or
other
he
had
not
procured
a
plan
reading
over
as
he
got
them
and
carefully
collating
therewith
the
histories
of
their
sieges
their
demolitions
their
improvements
and
new
works
all
which
he
would
read
with
that
intense
application
and
delight
that
he
would
forget
himself
his
wound
his
confinement
his
dinner
in
the
second
year
my
uncle
toby
purchased
ramelli
and
cataneo
translated
from
the
italian
likewise
stevinus
moralis
the
chevalier
de
ville
lorini
cochorn
sheeter
the
count
de
pagan
the
marshal
vauban
mons
blondel
with
almost
as
many
more
books
of
military
architecture
as
don
quixote
was
found
to
have
of
chivalry
when
the
curate
and
barber
invaded
his
library
towards
the
beginning
of
the
third
year
which
was
in
august
my
uncle
toby
found
it
necessary
to
understand
a
little
of
projectiles
and
having
judged
it
best
to
draw
his
knowledge
from
the
he
began
with
tartaglia
who
it
seems
was
the
first
man
who
detected
the
imposition
of
a
doing
all
that
mischief
under
the
notion
of
a
right
line
this
tartaglia
proved
to
my
uncle
toby
to
be
an
impossible
thing
endless
is
the
search
of
truth
no
sooner
was
my
uncle
toby
satisfied
which
road
the
did
not
go
but
he
was
insensibly
led
on
and
resolved
in
his
mind
to
enquire
and
find
out
which
road
the
ball
did
go
for
which
purpose
he
was
obliged
to
set
off
afresh
with
old
maltus
and
studied
him
he
proceeded
next
to
galileo
and
torricellius
wherein
by
certain
geometrical
rules
infallibly
laid
down
he
found
the
precise
path
to
be
a
parabola
or
else
an
hyperbola
and
that
the
parameter
or
latus
rectum
of
the
conic
section
of
the
said
path
was
to
the
quantity
and
amplitude
in
a
direct
ratio
as
the
whole
line
to
the
sine
of
double
the
angle
of
incidence
formed
by
the
breech
upon
an
horizontal
plane
and
that
the
semiparameter
stop
my
dear
uncle
toby
stop
go
not
one
foot
farther
into
this
thorny
and
bewildered
track
intricate
are
the
steps
intricate
are
the
mazes
of
this
labyrinth
intricate
are
the
troubles
which
the
pursuit
of
this
bewitching
phantom
knowledge
will
bring
upon
o
my
uncle
fly
fly
fly
from
it
as
from
a
is
it
fit
goodnatured
man
thou
sit
up
with
the
wound
upon
thy
groin
whole
nights
baking
thy
blood
with
hectic
watchings
alas
exasperate
thy
symptoms
check
thy
perspirations
evaporate
thy
spirits
waste
thy
animal
strength
dry
up
thy
radical
moisture
bring
thee
into
a
costive
habit
of
body
impair
thy
health
and
hasten
all
the
infirmities
of
thy
old
o
my
uncle
my
uncle
toby
chapter
i
would
not
give
a
groat
for
that
man
knowledge
in
who
does
not
understand
this
that
the
best
plain
narrative
in
the
world
tacked
very
close
to
the
last
spirited
apostrophe
to
my
uncle
toby
would
have
felt
both
cold
and
vapid
upon
the
reader
palate
therefore
i
forthwith
put
an
end
to
the
chapter
though
i
was
in
the
middle
of
my
story
writers
of
my
stamp
have
one
principle
in
common
with
painters
where
an
exact
copying
makes
our
pictures
less
striking
we
choose
the
less
evil
deeming
it
even
more
pardonable
to
trespass
against
truth
than
beauty
this
is
to
be
understood
cum
grano
salis
but
be
it
as
it
will
as
the
parallel
is
made
more
for
the
sake
of
letting
the
apostrophe
cool
than
any
thing
else
is
not
very
material
whether
upon
any
other
score
the
reader
approves
of
it
or
not
in
the
latter
end
of
the
third
year
my
uncle
toby
perceiving
that
the
parameter
and
of
the
conic
section
angered
his
wound
he
left
off
the
study
of
projectiles
in
a
kind
of
a
huff
and
betook
himself
to
the
practical
part
of
fortification
only
the
pleasure
of
which
like
a
spring
held
back
returned
upon
him
with
redoubled
force
it
was
in
this
year
that
my
uncle
began
to
break
in
upon
the
daily
regularity
of
a
clean
shirt
to
dismiss
his
barber
unshaven
and
to
allow
his
surgeon
scarce
time
sufficient
to
dress
his
wound
concerning
himself
so
little
about
it
as
not
to
ask
him
once
in
seven
times
dressing
how
it
went
on
when
lo
all
of
a
sudden
for
the
change
was
quick
as
lightning
he
began
to
sigh
heavily
for
his
recovery
complained
to
my
father
grew
impatient
with
the
surgeon
and
one
morning
as
he
heard
his
foot
coming
up
stairs
he
shut
up
his
books
and
thrust
aside
his
instruments
in
order
to
expostulate
with
him
upon
the
protraction
of
the
cure
which
he
told
him
might
surely
have
been
accomplished
at
least
by
that
time
he
dwelt
long
upon
the
miseries
he
had
undergone
and
the
sorrows
of
his
four
years
melancholy
imprisonment
adding
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
kind
looks
and
fraternal
chearings
of
the
best
of
brothers
he
had
long
since
sunk
under
his
my
father
was
by
my
uncle
toby
eloquence
brought
tears
into
his
eyes
was
unexpected
my
uncle
toby
by
nature
was
not
eloquent
it
had
the
greater
effect
the
surgeon
was
confounded
not
that
there
wanted
grounds
for
such
or
greater
marks
of
impatience
but
was
unexpected
too
in
the
four
years
he
had
attended
him
he
had
never
seen
any
thing
like
it
in
my
uncle
toby
carriage
he
had
never
once
dropped
one
fretful
or
discontented
word
he
had
been
all
patience
all
submission
we
lose
the
right
of
complaining
sometimes
by
forbearing
it
but
we
often
treble
the
force
the
surgeon
was
astonished
but
much
more
so
when
he
heard
my
uncle
toby
go
on
and
peremptorily
insist
upon
his
healing
up
the
wound
directly
or
sending
for
monsieur
ronjat
the
king
to
do
it
for
him
the
desire
of
life
and
health
is
implanted
in
man
nature
the
love
of
liberty
and
enlargement
is
a
to
it
these
my
uncle
toby
had
in
common
with
his
species
and
either
of
them
had
been
sufficient
to
account
for
his
earnest
desire
to
get
well
and
out
of
doors
but
i
have
told
you
before
that
nothing
wrought
with
our
family
after
the
common
way
and
from
the
time
and
manner
in
which
this
eager
desire
shewed
itself
in
the
present
case
the
penetrating
reader
will
suspect
there
was
some
other
cause
or
crotchet
for
it
in
my
uncle
head
there
was
so
and
is
the
subject
of
the
next
chapter
to
set
forth
what
that
cause
and
crotchet
was
i
own
when
that
done
be
time
to
return
back
to
the
parlour
where
we
left
my
uncle
toby
in
the
middle
of
his
sentence
chapter
when
a
man
gives
himself
up
to
the
government
of
a
ruling
passion
or
in
other
words
when
his
grows
headstrong
farewell
cool
reason
and
fair
discretion
my
uncle
toby
wound
was
near
well
and
as
soon
as
the
surgeon
recovered
his
surprize
and
could
get
leave
to
say
as
much
he
told
him
was
just
beginning
to
incarnate
and
that
if
no
fresh
exfoliation
happened
which
there
was
no
sign
of
it
would
be
dried
up
in
five
or
six
weeks
the
sound
of
as
many
olympiads
twelve
hours
before
would
have
conveyed
an
idea
of
shorter
duration
to
my
uncle
toby
the
succession
of
his
ideas
was
now
rapid
he
broiled
with
impatience
to
put
his
design
in
execution
and
so
without
consulting
farther
with
any
soul
living
which
by
the
bye
i
think
is
right
when
you
are
predetermined
to
take
no
one
soul
advice
he
privately
ordered
trim
his
man
to
pack
up
a
bundle
of
lint
and
dressings
and
hire
a
to
be
at
the
door
exactly
by
twelve
that
day
when
he
knew
my
father
would
be
upon
so
leaving
a
upon
the
table
for
the
surgeon
care
of
him
and
a
letter
of
tender
thanks
for
his
brother
he
packed
up
his
maps
his
books
of
fortification
his
instruments
and
by
the
help
of
a
crutch
on
one
side
and
trim
on
the
other
my
uncle
toby
embarked
for
the
reason
or
rather
the
rise
of
this
sudden
demigration
was
as
follows
the
table
in
my
uncle
toby
room
and
at
which
the
night
before
this
change
happened
he
was
sitting
with
his
maps
about
him
being
somewhat
of
the
smallest
for
that
infinity
of
great
and
small
instruments
of
knowledge
which
usually
lay
crowded
upon
it
he
had
the
accident
in
reaching
over
for
his
to
throw
down
his
compasses
and
in
stooping
to
take
the
compasses
up
with
his
sleeve
he
threw
down
his
case
of
instruments
and
snuffers
and
as
the
dice
took
a
run
against
him
in
his
endeavouring
to
catch
the
snuffers
in
falling
he
thrust
monsieur
blondel
off
the
table
and
count
de
pagon
of
him
was
to
no
purpose
for
a
man
lame
as
my
uncle
toby
was
to
think
of
redressing
these
evils
by
himself
he
rung
his
bell
for
his
man
trim
trim
quoth
my
uncle
toby
prithee
see
what
confusion
i
have
here
been
making
i
must
have
some
better
contrivance
not
thou
take
my
rule
and
measure
the
length
and
breadth
of
this
table
and
then
go
and
bespeak
me
one
as
big
again
yes
an
please
your
honour
replied
trim
making
a
bow
but
i
hope
your
honour
will
be
soon
well
enough
to
get
down
to
your
where
as
your
honour
takes
so
much
pleasure
in
fortification
we
could
manage
this
matter
to
a
i
must
here
inform
you
that
this
servant
of
my
uncle
toby
who
went
by
the
name
of
trim
had
been
a
corporal
in
my
uncle
own
company
his
real
name
was
james
butler
but
having
got
the
of
trim
in
the
regiment
my
uncle
toby
unless
when
he
happened
to
be
very
angry
with
him
would
never
call
him
by
any
other
name
the
poor
fellow
had
been
disabled
for
the
service
by
a
wound
on
his
left
knee
by
a
at
the
battle
of
landen
which
was
two
years
before
the
affair
of
namur
and
as
the
fellow
was
in
the
regiment
and
a
handy
fellow
into
the
bargain
my
uncle
toby
took
him
for
his
servant
and
of
an
excellent
use
was
he
attending
my
uncle
toby
in
the
camp
and
in
his
quarters
as
a
valet
groom
barber
cook
sempster
and
nurse
and
indeed
from
first
to
last
waited
upon
him
and
served
him
with
great
fidelity
and
affection
my
uncle
toby
loved
the
man
in
return
and
what
attached
him
more
to
him
still
was
the
similitude
of
their
for
corporal
trim
for
so
for
the
future
i
shall
call
him
by
four
years
occasional
attention
to
his
master
discourse
upon
fortified
towns
and
the
advantage
of
prying
and
peeping
continually
into
his
master
plans
exclusive
and
besides
what
he
gained
as
a
non
hobby
horsical
per
se
had
become
no
mean
proficient
in
the
science
and
was
thought
by
the
cook
and
to
know
as
much
of
the
nature
of
as
my
uncle
toby
himself
i
have
but
one
more
stroke
to
give
to
finish
corporal
character
and
it
is
the
only
dark
line
in
the
fellow
loved
to
advise
or
rather
to
hear
himself
talk
his
carriage
however
was
so
perfectly
respectful
was
easy
to
keep
him
silent
when
you
had
him
so
but
set
his
tongue
you
had
no
hold
of
him
he
was
voluble
the
eternal
interlardings
of
your
honour
with
the
respectfulness
of
corporal
trim
manner
interceding
so
strong
in
behalf
of
his
elocution
that
though
you
might
have
been
incommoded
you
could
not
well
be
angry
my
uncle
toby
was
seldom
either
the
one
or
the
other
with
him
or
at
least
this
fault
in
trim
broke
no
squares
with
them
my
uncle
toby
as
i
said
loved
the
man
and
besides
as
he
ever
looked
upon
a
faithful
servant
but
as
an
humble
friend
he
could
not
bear
to
stop
his
such
was
corporal
trim
if
i
durst
presume
continued
trim
to
give
your
honour
my
advice
and
speak
my
opinion
in
this
thou
art
welcome
trim
quoth
my
uncle
toby
speak
speak
what
thou
thinkest
upon
the
subject
man
without
why
then
replied
trim
not
hanging
his
ears
and
scratching
his
head
like
a
but
stroking
his
hair
back
from
his
forehead
and
standing
erect
as
before
his
division
i
think
quoth
trim
advancing
his
left
which
was
his
lame
leg
a
little
forwards
and
pointing
with
his
right
hand
open
towards
a
map
of
dunkirk
which
was
pinned
against
the
hangings
i
think
quoth
corporal
trim
with
humble
submission
to
your
honour
better
judgment
that
these
ravelins
bastions
curtins
and
hornworks
make
but
a
poor
contemptible
piece
of
work
of
it
here
upon
paper
compared
to
what
your
honour
and
i
could
make
of
it
were
we
in
the
country
by
ourselves
and
had
but
a
rood
or
a
rood
and
a
half
of
ground
to
do
what
we
pleased
with
as
summer
is
coming
on
continued
trim
your
honour
might
sit
out
of
doors
and
give
me
the
nography
call
it
ichnography
quoth
my
uncle
of
the
town
or
citadel
your
honour
was
pleased
to
sit
down
before
and
i
will
be
shot
by
your
honour
upon
the
glacis
of
it
if
i
did
not
fortify
it
to
your
honour
i
dare
say
thou
trim
quoth
my
for
if
your
honour
continued
the
corporal
could
but
mark
me
the
polygon
with
its
exact
lines
and
angles
that
i
could
do
very
well
quoth
my
i
would
begin
with
the
fosse
and
if
your
honour
could
tell
me
the
proper
depth
and
breadth
i
can
to
a
breadth
trim
replied
my
i
would
throw
out
the
earth
upon
this
hand
towards
the
town
for
the
scarp
and
on
that
hand
towards
the
campaign
for
the
very
right
trim
quoth
my
uncle
toby
and
when
i
had
sloped
them
to
your
mind
an
please
your
honour
i
would
face
the
glacis
as
the
finest
fortifications
are
done
in
flanders
with
sods
and
as
your
honour
knows
they
should
be
and
i
would
make
the
walls
and
parapets
with
sods
the
best
engineers
call
them
gazons
trim
said
my
uncle
whether
they
are
gazons
or
sods
is
not
much
matter
replied
trim
your
honour
knows
they
are
ten
times
beyond
a
facing
either
of
brick
or
i
know
they
are
trim
in
some
respects
quoth
my
uncle
toby
nodding
his
head
for
a
enters
into
the
gazon
right
onwards
without
bringing
any
rubbish
down
with
it
which
might
fill
the
fosse
as
was
the
case
at
nicolas
gate
and
facilitate
the
passage
over
it
your
honour
understands
these
matters
replied
corporal
trim
better
than
any
officer
in
his
majesty
service
but
would
your
honour
please
to
let
the
bespeaking
of
the
table
alone
and
let
us
but
go
into
the
country
i
would
work
under
your
honour
directions
like
a
horse
and
make
fortifications
for
you
something
like
a
tansy
with
all
their
batteries
saps
ditches
and
palisadoes
that
it
should
be
worth
all
the
world
riding
twenty
miles
to
go
and
see
it
my
uncle
toby
blushed
as
red
as
scarlet
as
trim
went
on
but
it
was
not
a
blush
of
guilt
of
modesty
or
of
anger
it
was
a
blush
of
joy
he
was
fired
with
corporal
trim
project
and
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
thou
hast
said
we
might
begin
the
campaign
continued
trim
on
the
very
day
that
his
majesty
and
the
allies
take
the
field
and
demolish
them
town
by
town
as
fast
as
trim
quoth
my
uncle
toby
say
no
more
your
honour
continued
trim
might
sit
in
your
pointing
to
it
this
fine
weather
giving
me
your
orders
and
i
would
say
no
more
trim
quoth
my
uncle
toby
besides
your
honour
would
get
not
only
pleasure
and
good
pastime
but
good
air
and
good
exercise
and
good
health
and
your
honour
wound
would
be
well
in
a
month
thou
hast
said
enough
trim
quoth
my
uncle
toby
putting
his
hand
into
his
i
like
thy
project
and
if
your
honour
pleases
i
this
moment
go
and
buy
a
pioneer
spade
to
take
down
with
us
and
i
bespeak
a
shovel
and
a
and
a
couple
of
say
no
more
trim
quoth
my
uncle
toby
leaping
up
upon
one
leg
quite
overcome
with
rapture
and
thrusting
a
guinea
into
hand
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
say
no
more
but
go
down
trim
this
moment
my
lad
and
bring
up
my
supper
this
instant
trim
ran
down
and
brought
up
his
master
supper
to
no
purpose
trim
plan
of
operation
ran
so
in
my
uncle
toby
head
he
could
not
taste
trim
quoth
my
uncle
toby
get
me
to
was
all
corporal
trim
description
had
fired
his
imagination
my
uncle
toby
could
not
shut
his
the
more
he
considered
it
the
more
bewitching
the
scene
appeared
to
him
so
that
two
full
hours
before
he
had
come
to
a
final
determination
and
had
concerted
the
whole
plan
of
his
and
corporal
trim
decampment
my
uncle
toby
had
a
little
neat
of
his
own
in
the
village
where
my
father
estate
lay
at
shandy
which
had
been
left
him
by
an
old
uncle
with
a
small
estate
of
about
one
hundred
pounds
behind
this
house
and
contiguous
to
it
was
a
of
about
half
an
acre
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
and
cut
off
from
it
by
a
tall
yew
hedge
was
a
containing
just
about
as
much
ground
as
corporal
trim
wished
for
so
that
as
trim
uttered
the
words
rood
and
a
half
of
ground
to
do
what
they
would
with
this
identical
instantly
presented
itself
and
became
curiously
painted
all
at
once
upon
the
retina
of
my
uncle
toby
fancy
which
was
the
physical
cause
of
making
him
change
colour
or
at
least
of
heightening
his
blush
to
that
immoderate
degree
i
spoke
of
never
did
lover
post
down
to
a
beloved
mistress
with
more
heat
and
expectation
than
my
uncle
toby
did
to
enjoy
this
thing
in
private
i
say
in
private
for
it
was
sheltered
from
the
house
as
i
told
you
by
a
tall
yew
hedge
and
was
covered
on
the
other
three
sides
from
mortal
sight
by
rough
holly
and
flowering
shrubs
so
that
the
idea
of
not
being
seen
did
not
a
little
contribute
to
the
idea
of
pleasure
in
my
uncle
toby
vain
thought
however
thick
it
was
planted
about
or
private
soever
it
might
seem
to
think
dear
uncle
toby
of
enjoying
a
thing
which
took
up
a
whole
rood
and
a
half
of
ground
and
not
have
it
known
how
my
uncle
toby
and
corporal
trim
managed
this
matter
with
the
history
of
their
campaigns
which
were
no
way
barren
of
events
may
make
no
uninteresting
in
the
epitasis
and
of
this
at
present
the
scene
must
drop
and
change
for
the
parlour
chapter
what
can
they
be
doing
brother
said
my
i
think
replied
my
uncle
toby
taking
as
i
told
you
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
striking
the
ashes
out
of
it
as
he
began
his
sentence
i
think
replied
he
it
would
not
be
amiss
brother
if
we
rung
the
bell
pray
what
all
that
racket
over
our
heads
obadiah
quoth
my
father
my
brother
and
i
can
scarce
hear
ourselves
speak
sir
answered
obadiah
making
a
bow
towards
his
left
shoulder
my
mistress
is
taken
very
and
where
susannah
running
down
the
garden
there
as
if
they
were
going
to
ravish
her
sir
she
is
running
the
shortest
cut
into
the
town
replied
obadiah
to
fetch
the
old
then
saddle
a
horse
quoth
my
father
and
do
you
go
directly
for
slop
the
with
all
our
services
and
let
him
know
your
mistress
is
fallen
into
labour
and
that
i
desire
he
will
return
with
you
with
all
speed
it
is
very
strange
says
my
father
addressing
himself
to
my
uncle
toby
as
obadiah
shut
the
door
as
there
is
so
expert
an
operator
as
slop
so
near
that
my
wife
should
persist
to
the
very
last
in
this
obstinate
humour
of
hers
in
trusting
the
life
of
my
child
who
has
had
one
misfortune
already
to
the
ignorance
of
an
old
woman
and
not
only
the
life
of
my
child
brother
but
her
own
life
and
with
it
the
lives
of
all
the
children
i
might
peradventure
have
begot
out
of
her
hereafter
mayhap
brother
replied
my
uncle
toby
my
sister
does
it
to
save
the
expence
a
pudding
end
replied
my
father
the
doctor
must
be
paid
the
same
for
inaction
as
action
if
not
better
to
keep
him
in
temper
then
it
can
be
out
of
nothing
in
the
whole
world
quoth
my
uncle
toby
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
but
my
sister
i
dare
say
added
he
does
not
care
to
let
a
man
come
so
near
her
i
will
not
say
whether
my
uncle
toby
had
completed
the
sentence
or
not
is
for
his
advantage
to
suppose
he
had
as
i
think
he
could
have
added
no
one
word
which
would
have
improved
it
if
on
the
contrary
my
uncle
toby
had
not
fully
arrived
at
the
end
then
the
world
stands
indebted
to
the
sudden
snapping
of
my
father
for
one
of
the
neatest
examples
of
that
ornamental
figure
in
oratory
which
rhetoricians
stile
the
just
heaven
how
does
the
poco
piu
and
the
poco
meno
of
the
italian
artists
the
insensible
more
or
less
determine
the
precise
line
of
beauty
in
the

sister
mayhap
quoth
my
uncle
toby
not
choose
to
let
a
man
come
so
near

dash

aposiopesis
take
the

away

scratch
backside
out
and
put
cover

in
is
a
metaphor
and
i
dare
say
as
fortification
ran
so
much
in
my
uncle
toby
head
that
if
he
had
been
left
to
have
added
one
word
to
the
sentence
that
word
was
it
but
whether
that
was
the
case
or
not
the
case
or
whether
the
snapping
of
my
father
so
critically
happened
through
accident
or
anger
will
be
seen
in
due
time
chapter
tho
my
father
was
a
good
natural
philosopher
yet
he
was
something
of
a
moral
philosopher
too
for
which
reason
when
his
short
in
the
middle
he
had
nothing
to
do
as
such
but
to
have
taken
hold
of
the
two
pieces
and
thrown
them
gently
upon
the
back
of
the
he
did
no
such
thing
he
threw
them
with
all
the
violence
in
the
world
and
to
give
the
action
still
more
emphasis
he
started
upon
both
his
legs
to
do
it
this
looked
something
like
heat
and
the
manner
of
his
reply
to
what
my
uncle
toby
was
saying
proved
it
was
so
choose
quoth
my
father
repeating
my
uncle
toby
words
let
a
man
come
so
near
her
by
heaven
brother
toby
you
would
try
the
patience
of
job
and
i
think
i
have
the
plagues
of
one
already
without
why
where
wherein
wherefore
upon
what
account
replied
my
uncle
toby
in
the
utmost
to
think
said
my
father
of
a
man
living
to
your
age
brother
and
knowing
so
little
about
women
i
know
nothing
at
all
about
them
replied
my
uncle
toby
and
i
think
continued
he
that
the
shock
i
received
the
year
after
the
demolition
of
dunkirk
in
my
affair
with
widow
wadman
which
shock
you
know
i
should
not
have
received
but
from
my
total
ignorance
of
the
sex
has
given
me
just
cause
to
say
that
i
neither
know
nor
do
pretend
to
know
any
thing
about
or
their
concerns
methinks
brother
replied
my
father
you
might
at
least
know
so
much
as
the
right
end
of
a
woman
from
the
wrong
it
is
said
in
aristotle
master
piece
when
a
man
doth
think
of
any
thing
which
is
past
he
looketh
down
upon
the
ground
but
that
when
he
thinketh
of
something
that
is
to
come
he
looketh
up
towards
the
heavens
my
uncle
toby
i
suppose
thought
of
neither
for
he
right
end
quoth
my
uncle
toby
muttering
the
two
words
low
to
himself
and
fixing
his
two
eyes
insensibly
as
he
muttered
them
upon
a
small
crevice
formed
by
a
bad
joint
in
the
right
end
of
a
woman
i
declare
quoth
my
uncle
i
know
no
more
which
it
is
than
the
man
in
the
moon
and
if
i
was
to
think
continued
my
uncle
toby
keeping
his
eyes
still
fixed
upon
the
bad
joint
this
month
together
i
am
sure
i
should
not
be
able
to
find
it
out
then
brother
toby
replied
my
father
i
will
tell
you
every
thing
in
this
world
continued
my
father
filling
a
fresh
pipe
every
thing
in
this
world
my
dear
brother
toby
has
two
not
always
quoth
my
uncle
at
least
replied
my
father
every
one
has
two
hands
which
comes
to
the
same
now
if
a
man
was
to
sit
down
coolly
and
consider
within
himself
the
make
the
shape
the
construction
and
convenience
of
all
the
parts
which
constitute
the
whole
of
that
animal
called
woman
and
compare
them
analogically
i
never
understood
rightly
the
meaning
of
that
word
quoth
my
uncle
analogy
replied
my
father
is
the
certain
relation
and
agreement
which
different
here
a
devil
of
a
rap
at
the
door
snapped
my
definition
like
his
in
two
and
at
the
same
time
crushed
the
head
of
as
notable
and
curious
a
dissertation
as
ever
was
engendered
in
the
womb
of
speculation
it
was
some
months
before
my
father
could
get
an
opportunity
to
be
safely
delivered
of
it
and
at
this
hour
it
is
a
thing
full
as
problematical
as
the
subject
of
the
dissertation
itself
considering
the
confusion
and
distresses
of
our
domestick
misadventures
which
are
now
coming
thick
one
upon
the
back
of
another
whether
i
shall
be
able
to
find
a
place
for
it
in
the
third
volume
or
not
chapter
it
is
about
an
hour
and
a
half
tolerable
good
reading
since
my
uncle
toby
rung
the
bell
when
obadiah
was
ordered
to
saddle
a
horse
and
go
for
slop
the
so
that
no
one
can
say
with
reason
that
i
have
not
allowed
obadiah
time
enough
poetically
speaking
and
considering
the
emergency
too
both
to
go
and
come
though
morally
and
truly
speaking
the
man
perhaps
has
scarce
had
time
to
get
on
his
boots
if
the
hypercritick
will
go
upon
this
and
is
resolved
after
all
to
take
a
pendulum
and
measure
the
true
distance
betwixt
the
ringing
of
the
bell
and
the
rap
at
the
door
and
after
finding
it
to
be
no
more
than
two
minutes
thirteen
seconds
and
should
take
upon
him
to
insult
over
me
for
such
a
breach
in
the
unity
or
rather
probability
of
time
i
would
remind
him
that
the
idea
of
duration
and
of
its
simple
modes
is
got
merely
from
the
train
and
succession
of
our
ideas
and
is
the
true
scholastic
pendulum
and
by
which
as
a
scholar
i
will
be
tried
in
this
matter
abjuring
and
detesting
the
jurisdiction
of
all
other
pendulums
whatever
i
would
therefore
desire
him
to
consider
that
it
is
but
poor
eight
miles
from
to
slop
the
house
and
that
whilst
obadiah
has
been
going
those
said
miles
and
back
i
have
brought
my
uncle
toby
from
namur
quite
across
all
flanders
into
england
that
i
have
had
him
ill
upon
my
hands
near
four
years
and
have
since
travelled
him
and
corporal
trim
in
a
a
journey
of
near
two
hundred
miles
down
into
all
which
put
together
must
have
prepared
the
reader
imagination
for
the
entrance
of
slop
upon
the
stage
as
much
at
least
i
hope
as
a
dance
a
song
or
a
concerto
between
the
acts
if
my
hypercritick
is
intractable
alledging
that
two
minutes
and
thirteen
seconds
are
no
more
than
two
minutes
and
thirteen
seconds
when
i
have
said
all
i
can
about
them
and
that
this
plea
though
it
might
save
me
dramatically
will
damn
me
biographically
rendering
my
book
from
this
very
moment
a
professed
romance
which
before
was
a
book
apocryphal
if
i
am
thus
pressed
i
then
put
an
end
to
the
whole
objection
and
controversy
about
it
all
at
once
by
acquainting
him
that
obadiah
had
not
got
above
threescore
yards
from
the
before
he
met
with
slop
and
indeed
he
gave
a
dirty
proof
that
he
had
met
with
him
and
was
within
an
ace
of
giving
a
tragical
one
too
imagine
to
yourself
but
this
had
better
begin
a
new
chapter
chapter
imagine
to
yourself
a
little
squat
uncourtly
figure
of
a
doctor
slop
of
about
four
feet
and
a
half
perpendicular
height
with
a
breadth
of
back
and
a
sesquipedality
of
belly
which
might
have
done
honour
to
a
serjeant
in
the
such
were
the
of
slop
figure
which
if
you
have
read
hogarth
analysis
of
beauty
and
if
you
have
not
i
wish
you
would
you
must
know
may
as
certainly
be
caricatured
and
conveyed
to
the
mind
by
three
strokes
as
three
hundred
imagine
such
a
one
for
such
i
say
were
the
outlines
of
figure
coming
slowly
along
foot
by
foot
waddling
thro
the
dirt
upon
the
vertebrae
of
a
little
diminutive
pony
of
a
pretty
colour
but
of
strength
alack
scarce
able
to
have
made
an
amble
of
it
under
such
a
fardel
had
the
roads
been
in
an
ambling
they
were
imagine
to
yourself
obadiah
mounted
upon
a
strong
monster
of
a
pricked
into
a
full
gallop
and
making
all
practicable
speed
the
adverse
way
pray
sir
let
me
interest
you
a
moment
in
this
description
had
slop
beheld
obadiah
a
mile
off
posting
in
a
narrow
lane
directly
towards
him
at
that
monstrous
rate
splashing
and
plunging
like
a
devil
thro
thick
and
thin
as
he
approached
would
not
such
a
phaenomenon
with
such
a
vortex
of
mud
and
water
moving
along
with
it
round
its
axis
have
been
a
subject
of
juster
apprehension
to
slop
in
his
situation
than
the
worst
of
whiston
comets
to
say
nothing
of
the
nucleus
that
is
of
obadiah
and
the
in
my
idea
the
vortex
alone
of
was
enough
to
have
involved
and
carried
if
not
the
doctor
at
least
the
doctor
pony
quite
away
with
it
what
then
do
you
think
must
the
terror
and
hydrophobia
of
slop
have
been
when
you
read
which
you
are
just
going
to
do
that
he
was
advancing
thus
warily
along
towards
and
had
approached
to
within
sixty
yards
of
it
and
within
five
yards
of
a
sudden
turn
made
by
an
acute
angle
of
the
and
in
the
dirtiest
part
of
a
dirty
lane
when
obadiah
and
his
turned
the
corner
rapid
furious
pop
full
upon
him
nothing
i
think
in
nature
can
be
supposed
more
terrible
than
such
a
rencounter
so
imprompt
so
ill
prepared
to
stand
the
shock
of
it
as
slop
was
what
could
slop
do
he
crossed
himself
pugh
but
the
doctor
sir
was
a
no
matter
he
had
better
have
kept
hold
of
the
he
had
so
nay
as
it
happened
he
had
better
have
done
nothing
at
all
for
in
crossing
himself
he
let
go
his
whip
and
in
attempting
to
save
his
whip
betwixt
his
knee
and
his
saddle
skirt
as
it
slipped
he
lost
his
stirrup
in
losing
which
he
lost
his
seat
and
in
the
multitude
of
all
these
losses
which
by
the
bye
shews
what
little
advantage
there
is
in
crossing
the
unfortunate
doctor
lost
his
presence
of
mind
so
that
without
waiting
for
obadiah
onset
he
left
his
pony
to
its
destiny
tumbling
off
it
diagonally
something
in
the
stile
and
manner
of
a
pack
of
wool
and
without
any
other
consequence
from
the
fall
save
that
of
being
left
as
it
would
have
been
with
the
broadest
part
of
him
sunk
about
twelve
inches
deep
in
the
mire
obadiah
pull
off
his
cap
twice
to
slop
once
as
he
was
falling
and
then
again
when
he
saw
him
complaisance
had
not
the
fellow
better
have
stopped
his
horse
and
got
off
and
help
him
sir
he
did
all
that
his
situation
would
allow
but
the
momentum
of
the
was
so
great
that
obadiah
could
not
do
it
all
at
once
he
rode
in
a
circle
three
times
round
slop
before
he
could
fully
accomplish
it
any
how
and
at
the
last
when
he
did
stop
his
beast
was
done
with
such
an
explosion
of
mud
that
obadiah
had
better
have
been
a
league
off
in
short
never
was
a
slop
so
beluted
and
so
transubstantiated
since
that
affair
came
into
fashion
chapter
when
slop
entered
the
back
parlour
where
my
father
and
my
uncle
toby
were
discoursing
upon
the
nature
of
women
it
was
hard
to
determine
whether
slop
figure
or
slop
presence
occasioned
more
surprize
to
them
for
as
the
accident
happened
so
near
the
house
as
not
to
make
it
worth
while
for
obadiah
to
remount
him
obadiah
had
led
him
in
as
he
was
unwiped
unappointed
unannealed
with
all
his
stains
and
blotches
on
he
stood
like
hamlet
ghost
motionless
and
speechless
for
a
full
minute
and
a
half
at
the
obadiah
still
holding
his
hand
with
all
the
majesty
of
mud
his
hinder
parts
upon
which
he
had
received
his
fall
totally
besmeared
and
in
every
other
part
of
him
blotched
over
in
such
a
manner
with
explosion
that
you
would
have
sworn
without
mental
reservation
that
every
grain
of
it
had
taken
effect
here
was
a
fair
opportunity
for
my
uncle
toby
to
have
triumphed
over
my
father
in
his
turn
for
no
mortal
who
had
beheld
slop
in
that
pickle
could
have
dissented
from
so
much
at
least
of
my
uncle
opinion
mayhap
his
sister
might
not
care
to
let
such
a
slop
come
so
near
her
but
it
was
the
argumentum
ad
hominem
and
if
my
uncle
toby
was
not
very
expert
at
it
you
may
think
he
might
not
care
to
use
no
the
reason
was
was
not
his
nature
to
insult
slop
presence
at
that
time
was
no
less
problematical
than
the
mode
of
it
tho
it
is
certain
one
moment
reflexion
in
my
father
might
have
solved
it
for
he
had
apprized
slop
but
the
week
before
that
my
mother
was
at
her
full
reckoning
and
as
the
doctor
had
heard
nothing
since
was
natural
and
very
political
too
in
him
to
have
taken
a
ride
to
as
he
did
merely
to
see
how
matters
went
on
but
my
father
mind
took
unfortunately
a
wrong
turn
in
the
investigation
running
like
the
hypercritick
altogether
upon
the
ringing
of
the
bell
and
the
rap
upon
the
door
measuring
their
distance
and
keeping
his
mind
so
intent
upon
the
operation
as
to
have
power
to
think
of
nothing
else
infirmity
of
the
greatest
mathematicians
working
with
might
and
main
at
the
demonstration
and
so
wasting
all
their
strength
upon
it
that
they
have
none
left
in
them
to
draw
the
corollary
to
do
good
with
the
ringing
of
the
bell
and
the
rap
upon
the
door
struck
likewise
strong
upon
the
sensorium
of
my
uncle
toby
but
it
excited
a
very
different
train
of
thoughts
the
two
irreconcileable
pulsations
instantly
brought
stevinus
the
great
engineer
along
with
them
into
my
uncle
toby
mind
what
business
stevinus
had
in
this
affair
is
the
greatest
problem
of
all
it
shall
be
solved
but
not
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
writing
when
properly
managed
as
you
may
be
sure
i
think
mine
is
is
but
a
different
name
for
conversation
as
no
one
who
knows
what
he
is
about
in
good
company
would
venture
to
talk
all
so
no
author
who
understands
the
just
boundaries
of
decorum
and
would
presume
to
think
all
the
truest
respect
which
you
can
pay
to
the
reader
understanding
is
to
halve
this
matter
amicably
and
leave
him
something
to
imagine
in
his
turn
as
well
as
yourself
for
my
own
part
i
am
eternally
paying
him
compliments
of
this
kind
and
do
all
that
lies
in
my
power
to
keep
his
imagination
as
busy
as
my
own
is
his
turn
now
i
have
given
an
ample
description
of
sad
overthrow
and
of
his
sad
appearance
in
the
his
imagination
must
now
go
on
with
it
for
a
while
let
the
reader
imagine
then
that
slop
has
told
his
tale
and
in
what
words
and
with
what
aggravations
his
fancy
chooses
let
him
suppose
that
obadiah
has
told
his
tale
also
and
with
such
rueful
looks
of
affected
concern
as
he
thinks
best
will
contrast
the
two
figures
as
they
stand
by
each
let
him
imagine
that
my
father
has
stepped
up
stairs
to
see
my
and
to
conclude
this
work
of
imagination
let
him
imagine
the
doctor
washed
rubbed
down
and
condoled
felicitated
got
into
a
pair
of
obadiah
pumps
stepping
forwards
towards
the
door
upon
the
very
point
of
entering
upon
action
truce
truce
good
dr
slop
stay
thy
obstetrick
hand
return
it
safe
into
thy
bosom
to
keep

thou
been
entrusted
with
the
secret
articles
of
the
solemn
treaty
which
has
brought
thee
into
this
place
art
thou
aware
that
at
this
instant
a
daughter
of
lucina
is
put
obstetrically
over
thy

upon

to

with
all

make
great
haste
obadiah
quoth
my
father
and
i
give
thee
a
crown
and
quoth
my
uncle
toby
i
give
him
another
chapter
your
sudden
and
unexpected
arrival
quoth
my
uncle
toby
addressing
himself
to
slop
all
three
of
them
sitting
down
to
the
fire
together
as
my
uncle
toby
began
to
speak
instantly
brought
the
great
stevinus
into
my
head
who
you
must
know
is
a
favourite
author
with
then
added
my
father
making
use
of
the
argument
ad
crumenam
i
will
lay
twenty
guineas
to
a
single
which
will
serve
to
give
away
to
obadiah
when
he
gets
back
that
this
same
stevinus
was
some
engineer
or
other
or
has
wrote
something
or
other
either
directly
or
indirectly
upon
the
science
of
fortification
he
has
so
replied
my
uncle
i
knew
it
said
my
father
though
for
the
soul
of
me
i
can
not
see
what
kind
of
connection
there
can
be
betwixt
slop
sudden
coming
and
a
discourse
upon
fortification
yet
i
fear
talk
of
what
we
will
brother
or
let
the
occasion
be
never
so
foreign
or
unfit
for
the
subject
you
are
sure
to
bring
it
in
i
would
not
brother
toby
continued
my
father
i
declare
i
would
not
have
my
head
so
full
of
curtins
and
that
i
dare
say
you
would
not
quoth
slop
interrupting
him
and
laughing
most
immoderately
at
his
pun
dennis
the
critic
could
not
detest
and
abhor
a
pun
or
the
insinuation
of
a
pun
more
cordially
than
my
father
he
would
grow
testy
upon
it
at
any
time
but
to
be
broke
in
upon
by
one
in
a
serious
discourse
was
as
bad
he
would
say
as
a
fillip
upon
the
nose
he
saw
no
difference
sir
quoth
my
uncle
toby
addressing
himself
to
slop
the
curtins
my
brother
shandy
mentions
here
have
nothing
to
do
with
beadsteads
tho
i
know
du
cange
says
in
all
probability
have
taken
their
name
from
them
nor
have
the
he
speaks
of
any
thing
in
the
world
to
do
with
the
of
cuckoldom
but
the
curtin
sir
is
the
word
we
use
in
fortification
for
that
part
of
the
wall
or
rampart
which
lies
between
the
two
bastions
and
joins
them
besiegers
seldom
offer
to
carry
on
their
attacks
directly
against
the
curtin
for
this
reason
because
they
are
so
well
flanked
is
the
case
of
other
curtains
quoth
slop
laughing
however
continued
my
uncle
toby
to
make
them
sure
we
generally
choose
to
place
ravelins
before
them
taking
care
only
to
extend
them
beyond
the
fosse
or
ditch
the
common
men
who
know
very
little
of
fortification
confound
the
ravelin
and
the
together
tho
they
are
very
different
things
not
in
their
figure
or
construction
for
we
make
them
exactly
alike
in
all
points
for
they
always
consist
of
two
faces
making
a
salient
angle
with
the
gorges
not
straight
but
in
form
of
a
crescent
where
then
lies
the
difference
quoth
my
father
a
little
testily
in
their
situations
answered
my
uncle
toby
for
when
a
ravelin
brother
stands
before
the
curtin
it
is
a
ravelin
and
when
a
ravelin
stands
before
a
bastion
then
the
ravelin
is
not
a
ravelin
it
is
a
a
likewise
is
a
and
no
more
so
long
as
it
stands
before
its
bastion
but
was
it
to
change
place
and
get
before
the
curtin
be
no
longer
a
a
in
that
case
is
not
a
is
no
more
than
a
i
think
quoth
my
father
that
the
noble
science
of
defence
has
its
weak
sides
as
well
as
others
as
for
the
high
ho
sigh
my
father
which
continued
my
uncle
toby
my
brother
was
speaking
of
they
are
a
very
considerable
part
of
an
outwork
they
are
called
by
the
french
engineers
ouvrage
a
corne
and
we
generally
make
them
to
cover
such
places
as
we
suspect
to
be
weaker
than
the
rest
is
formed
by
two
epaulments
or
they
are
very
pretty
and
if
you
will
take
a
walk
engage
to
shew
you
one
well
worth
your
i
own
continued
my
uncle
toby
when
we
crown
them
they
are
much
stronger
but
then
they
are
very
expensive
and
take
up
a
great
deal
of
ground
so
that
in
my
opinion
they
are
most
of
use
to
cover
or
defend
the
head
of
a
camp
otherwise
the
double
tenaille
by
the
mother
who
bore
us
brother
toby
quoth
my
father
not
able
to
hold
out
any
longer
you
would
provoke
a
saint
here
have
you
got
us
i
know
not
how
not
only
souse
into
the
middle
of
the
old
subject
again
but
so
full
is
your
head
of
these
confounded
works
that
though
my
wife
is
this
moment
in
the
pains
of
labour
and
you
hear
her
cry
out
yet
nothing
will
serve
you
but
to
carry
off
the
accoucheur
if
you
please
quoth
dr
with
all
my
heart
replied
my
father
i
do
care
what
they
call
you
but
i
wish
the
whole
science
of
fortification
with
all
its
inventors
at
the
devil
it
has
been
the
death
of
thousands
and
it
will
be
mine
in
the
i
would
not
i
would
not
brother
toby
have
my
brains
so
full
of
saps
mines
blinds
gabions
pallisadoes
ravelins
and
such
trumpery
to
be
proprietor
of
namur
and
of
all
the
towns
in
flanders
with
it
my
uncle
toby
was
a
man
patient
of
injuries
not
from
want
of
courage
i
have
told
you
in
a
former
chapter
he
was
a
man
of
courage
and
will
add
here
that
where
just
occasions
presented
or
called
it
forth
i
know
no
man
under
whose
arm
i
would
have
sooner
taken
shelter
nor
did
this
arise
from
any
insensibility
or
obtuseness
of
his
intellectual
parts
for
he
felt
this
insult
of
my
as
feelingly
as
a
man
could
do
but
he
was
of
a
peaceful
placid
nature
no
jarring
element
in
it
all
was
mixed
up
so
kindly
within
him
my
uncle
toby
had
scarce
a
heart
to
retaliate
upon
a
fly
go
says
he
one
day
at
dinner
to
an
one
which
had
buzzed
about
his
nose
and
tormented
him
cruelly
all
and
which
after
infinite
attempts
he
had
caught
at
last
as
it
flew
by
him
not
hurt
thee
says
my
uncle
toby
rising
from
his
chair
and
going
across
the
room
with
the
fly
in
his
hand
i
not
hurt
a
hair
of
thy
head
go
says
he
lifting
up
the
sash
and
opening
his
hand
as
he
spoke
to
let
it
escape
go
poor
devil
get
thee
gone
why
should
i
hurt
thee
this
world
surely
is
wide
enough
to
hold
both
thee
and
me
i
was
but
ten
years
old
when
this
happened
but
whether
it
was
that
the
action
itself
was
more
in
unison
to
my
nerves
at
that
age
of
pity
which
instantly
set
my
whole
frame
into
one
vibration
of
most
pleasurable
sensation
or
how
far
the
manner
and
expression
of
it
might
go
towards
it
or
in
what
degree
or
by
what
secret
magick
a
tone
of
voice
and
harmony
of
movement
attuned
by
mercy
might
find
a
passage
to
my
heart
i
know
not
this
i
know
that
the
lesson
of
universal
then
taught
and
imprinted
by
my
uncle
toby
has
never
since
been
worn
out
of
my
mind
and
tho
i
would
not
depreciate
what
the
study
of
the
literae
humaniores
at
the
university
have
done
for
me
in
that
respect
or
discredit
the
other
helps
of
an
expensive
education
bestowed
upon
me
both
at
home
and
abroad
since
yet
i
often
think
that
i
owe
one
half
of
my
philanthropy
to
that
one
accidental
impression
this
is
to
serve
for
parents
and
governors
instead
of
a
whole
volume
upon
the
subject
i
could
not
give
the
reader
this
stroke
in
my
uncle
toby
picture
by
the
instrument
with
which
i
drew
the
other
parts
of
it
that
taking
in
no
more
than
the
mere
likeness
this
is
a
part
of
his
moral
character
my
father
in
this
patient
endurance
of
wrongs
which
i
mention
was
very
different
as
the
reader
must
long
ago
have
noted
he
had
a
much
more
acute
and
quick
sensibility
of
nature
attended
with
a
little
soreness
of
temper
tho
this
never
transported
him
to
any
thing
which
looked
like
malignancy
yet
in
the
little
rubs
and
vexations
of
life
was
apt
to
shew
itself
in
a
drollish
and
witty
kind
of
peevishness
he
was
however
frank
and
generous
in
his
nature
at
all
times
open
to
conviction
and
in
the
little
ebullitions
of
this
subacid
humour
towards
others
but
particularly
towards
my
uncle
toby
whom
he
truly
loved
he
would
feel
more
pain
ten
times
told
except
in
the
affair
of
my
aunt
dinah
or
where
an
hypothesis
was
concerned
than
what
he
ever
gave
the
characters
of
the
two
brothers
in
this
view
of
them
reflected
light
upon
each
other
and
appeared
with
great
advantage
in
this
affair
which
arose
about
stevinus
i
need
not
tell
the
reader
if
he
keeps
a
that
a
is
as
tender
a
part
as
he
has
about
him
and
that
these
unprovoked
strokes
at
my
uncle
toby
could
not
be
unfelt
by
no
as
i
said
above
my
uncle
toby
did
feel
them
and
very
sensibly
too
pray
sir
what
said
he
how
did
he
behave
o
sir
it
was
great
for
as
soon
as
my
father
had
done
insulting
his
he
turned
his
head
without
the
least
emotion
from
slop
to
whom
he
was
addressing
his
discourse
and
looking
up
into
my
father
face
with
a
countenance
spread
over
with
so
much
so
placid
so
fraternal
so
inexpressibly
tender
towards
him
it
penetrated
my
father
to
his
heart
he
rose
up
hastily
from
his
chair
and
seizing
hold
of
both
my
uncle
toby
hands
as
he
spoke
brother
toby
said
he
i
beg
thy
pardon
forgive
i
pray
thee
this
rash
humour
which
my
mother
gave
my
dear
dear
brother
answered
my
uncle
toby
rising
up
by
my
father
help
say
no
more
about
it
you
are
heartily
welcome
had
it
been
ten
times
as
much
brother
but
is
ungenerous
replied
my
father
to
hurt
any
man
a
brother
worse
but
to
hurt
a
brother
of
such
gentle
manners
so
unprovoking
and
so
unresenting
is
base
by
heaven
you
are
heartily
welcome
brother
quoth
my
uncle
toby
had
it
been
fifty
times
as
besides
what
have
i
to
do
my
dear
toby
cried
my
father
either
with
your
amusements
or
your
pleasures
unless
it
was
in
my
power
which
it
is
not
to
increase
their
measure
brother
shandy
answered
my
uncle
toby
looking
wistfully
in
his
face
you
are
much
mistaken
in
this
point
for
you
do
increase
my
pleasure
very
much
in
begetting
children
for
the
shandy
family
at
your
time
of
but
by
that
sir
quoth
slop
shandy
increases
his
not
a
jot
quoth
my
father
chapter
my
brother
does
it
quoth
my
uncle
toby
out
of
in
a
family
way
i
suppose
quoth
dr
pshaw
said
my
father
is
not
worth
talking
of
chapter
at
the
end
of
the
last
chapter
my
father
and
my
uncle
toby
were
left
both
standing
like
brutus
and
cassius
at
the
close
of
the
scene
making
up
their
accounts
as
my
father
spoke
the
three
last
words
he
sat
down
my
uncle
toby
exactly
followed
his
example
only
that
before
he
took
his
chair
he
rung
the
bell
to
order
corporal
trim
who
was
in
waiting
to
step
home
for
stevinus
my
uncle
toby
house
being
no
farther
off
than
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
some
men
would
have
dropped
the
subject
of
stevinus
but
my
uncle
toby
had
no
resentment
in
his
heart
and
he
went
on
with
the
subject
to
shew
my
father
that
he
had
none
your
sudden
appearance
slop
quoth
my
uncle
resuming
the
discourse
instantly
brought
stevinus
into
my
head
my
father
you
may
be
sure
did
not
offer
to
lay
any
more
wagers
upon
head
because
continued
my
uncle
toby
the
celebrated
sailing
chariot
which
belonged
to
prince
maurice
and
was
of
such
wonderful
contrivance
and
velocity
as
to
carry
half
a
dozen
people
thirty
german
miles
in
i
do
know
how
few
minutes
was
invented
by
stevinus
that
great
mathematician
and
engineer
you
might
have
spared
your
servant
the
trouble
quoth
slop
as
the
fellow
is
lame
of
going
for
stevinus
account
of
it
because
in
my
return
from
leyden
thro
the
hague
i
walked
as
far
as
schevling
which
is
two
long
miles
on
purpose
to
take
a
view
of
it
that
nothing
replied
my
uncle
toby
to
what
the
learned
peireskius
did
who
walked
a
matter
of
five
hundred
miles
reckoning
from
paris
to
schevling
and
from
schevling
to
paris
back
again
in
order
to
see
it
and
nothing
else
some
men
can
not
bear
to
be
the
more
fool
peireskius
replied
slop
but
mark
was
out
of
no
contempt
of
peireskius
at
all
but
that
peireskius
indefatigable
labour
in
trudging
so
far
on
foot
out
of
love
for
the
sciences
reduced
the
exploit
of
slop
in
that
affair
to
nothing
the
more
fool
peireskius
said
he
why
so
replied
my
father
taking
his
brother
part
not
only
to
make
reparation
as
fast
as
he
could
for
the
insult
he
had
given
him
which
sat
still
upon
my
father
mind
but
partly
that
my
father
began
really
to
interest
himself
in
the
why
so
said
he
why
is
peireskius
or
any
man
else
to
be
abused
for
an
appetite
for
that
or
any
other
morsel
of
sound
knowledge
for
notwithstanding
i
know
nothing
of
the
chariot
in
question
continued
he
the
inventor
of
it
must
have
had
a
very
mechanical
head
and
i
can
not
guess
upon
what
principles
of
philosophy
he
has
atchieved
it
yet
certainly
his
machine
has
been
constructed
upon
solid
ones
be
they
what
they
will
or
it
could
not
have
answered
at
the
rate
my
brother
mentions
it
answered
replied
my
uncle
toby
as
well
if
not
better
for
as
peireskius
elegantly
expresses
it
speaking
of
the
velocity
of
its
motion
tam
citus
erat
quam
erat
ventus
which
unless
i
have
forgot
my
latin
is
that
it
was
as
swift
as
the
wind
itself
but
pray
slop
quoth
my
father
interrupting
my
uncle
tho
not
without
begging
pardon
for
it
at
the
same
time
upon
what
principles
was
this
chariot
set
upon
very
pretty
principles
to
be
sure
replied
slop
and
i
have
often
wondered
continued
he
evading
the
question
why
none
of
our
gentry
who
live
upon
large
plains
like
this
of
ours
especially
they
whose
wives
are
not
past
attempt
nothing
of
this
kind
for
it
would
not
only
be
infinitely
expeditious
upon
sudden
calls
to
which
the
sex
is
subject
if
the
wind
only
served
but
would
be
excellent
good
husbandry
to
make
use
of
the
winds
which
cost
nothing
and
which
eat
nothing
rather
than
horses
which
the
devil
take
both
cost
and
eat
a
great
deal
for
that
very
reason
replied
my
father
they
cost
nothing
and
because
they
eat
nothing
the
scheme
is
bad
it
is
the
consumption
of
our
products
as
well
as
the
manufactures
of
them
which
gives
bread
to
the
hungry
circulates
trade
brings
in
money
and
supports
the
value
of
our
lands
and
tho
i
own
if
i
was
a
prince
i
would
generously
recompense
the
scientifick
head
which
brought
forth
such
contrivances
yet
i
would
as
peremptorily
suppress
the
use
of
them
my
father
here
had
got
into
his
element
and
was
going
on
as
prosperously
with
his
dissertation
upon
trade
as
my
uncle
toby
had
before
upon
his
of
fortification
but
to
the
loss
of
much
sound
knowledge
the
destinies
in
the
morning
had
decreed
that
no
dissertation
of
any
kind
should
be
spun
by
my
father
that
day
for
as
he
opened
his
mouth
to
begin
the
next
sentence
chapter
in
popped
corporal
trim
with
stevinus
but
was
too
late
all
the
discourse
had
been
exhausted
without
him
and
was
running
into
a
new
channel
you
may
take
the
book
home
again
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
nodding
to
him
but
prithee
corporal
quoth
my
father
drolling
look
first
into
it
and
see
if
thou
canst
spy
aught
of
a
sailing
chariot
in
it
corporal
trim
by
being
in
the
service
had
learned
to
obey
and
not
to
remonstrate
so
taking
the
book
to
a
and
running
over
the
leaves
an
please
your
honour
said
trim
i
can
see
no
such
thing
however
continued
the
corporal
drolling
a
little
in
his
turn
i
make
sure
work
of
it
an
please
your
honour
so
taking
hold
of
the
two
covers
of
the
book
one
in
each
hand
and
letting
the
leaves
fall
down
as
he
bent
the
covers
back
he
gave
the
book
a
good
sound
shake
there
is
something
falling
out
however
said
trim
an
please
your
honour
but
it
is
not
a
chariot
or
any
thing
like
one
prithee
corporal
said
my
father
smiling
what
is
it
then
i
think
answered
trim
stooping
to
take
it
up
is
more
like
a
sermon
for
it
begins
with
a
text
of
scripture
and
the
chapter
and
verse
and
then
goes
on
not
as
a
chariot
but
like
a
sermon
directly
the
company
smiled
i
can
not
conceive
how
it
is
possible
quoth
my
uncle
toby
for
such
a
thing
as
a
sermon
to
have
got
into
my
stevinus
i
think
is
a
sermon
replied
trim
but
if
it
please
your
honours
as
it
is
a
fair
hand
i
will
read
you
a
page
for
trim
you
must
know
loved
to
hear
himself
read
almost
as
well
as
talk
i
have
ever
a
strong
propensity
said
my
father
to
look
into
things
which
cross
my
way
by
such
strange
fatalities
as
these
and
as
we
have
nothing
better
to
do
at
least
till
obadiah
gets
back
i
shall
be
obliged
to
you
brother
if
slop
has
no
objection
to
it
to
order
the
corporal
to
give
us
a
page
or
two
of
it
if
he
is
as
able
to
do
it
as
he
seems
willing
an
please
your
honour
quoth
trim
i
officiated
two
whole
campaigns
in
flanders
as
clerk
to
the
chaplain
of
the
he
can
read
it
quoth
my
uncle
toby
as
well
as
i
trim
i
assure
you
was
the
best
scholar
in
my
company
and
should
have
had
the
next
halberd
but
for
the
poor
fellow
misfortune
corporal
trim
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart
and
made
an
humble
bow
to
his
master
then
laying
down
his
hat
upon
the
floor
and
taking
up
the
sermon
in
his
left
hand
in
order
to
have
his
right
at
liberty
he
advanced
nothing
doubting
into
the
middle
of
the
room
where
he
could
best
see
and
be
best
seen
by
his
audience
chapter
if
you
have
any
objection
said
my
father
addressing
himself
to
slop
not
in
the
least
replied
slop
for
it
does
not
appear
on
which
side
of
the
question
it
is
wrote
it
may
be
a
composition
of
a
divine
of
our
church
as
well
as
yours
so
that
we
run
equal
is
wrote
upon
neither
side
quoth
trim
for
is
only
upon
conscience
an
please
your
honours
trim
reason
put
his
audience
into
good
humour
all
but
slop
who
turning
his
head
about
towards
trim
looked
a
little
angry
begin
trim
and
read
distinctly
quoth
my
i
will
please
your
honour
replied
the
corporal
making
a
bow
and
bespeaking
attention
with
a
slight
movement
of
his
right
hand
chapter
but
before
the
corporal
begins
i
must
first
give
you
a
description
of
his
attitude
otherwise
he
will
naturally
stand
represented
by
your
imagination
in
an
uneasy
posture
stiff
perpendicular
dividing
the
weight
of
his
body
equally
upon
both
legs
his
eye
fixed
as
if
on
duty
his
look
determined
clenching
the
sermon
in
his
left
hand
like
his
in
a
word
you
would
be
apt
to
paint
trim
as
if
he
was
standing
in
his
platoon
ready
for
action
his
attitude
was
as
unlike
all
this
as
you
can
conceive
he
stood
before
them
with
his
body
swayed
and
bent
forwards
just
so
far
as
to
make
an
angle
of
degrees
and
a
half
upon
the
plain
of
the
horizon
which
sound
orators
to
whom
i
address
this
know
very
well
to
be
the
true
persuasive
angle
of
incidence
in
any
other
angle
you
may
talk
and
preach
is
certain
and
it
is
done
every
day
but
with
what
effect
i
leave
the
world
to
judge
the
necessity
of
this
precise
angle
of
degrees
and
a
half
to
a
mathematical
exactness
does
it
not
shew
us
by
the
way
how
the
arts
and
sciences
mutually
befriend
each
other
how
the
duce
corporal
trim
who
knew
not
so
much
as
an
acute
angle
from
an
obtuse
one
came
to
hit
it
so
exactly
or
whether
it
was
chance
or
nature
or
good
sense
or
imitation
shall
be
commented
upon
in
that
part
of
the
cyclopaedia
of
arts
and
sciences
where
the
instrumental
parts
of
the
eloquence
of
the
senate
the
pulpit
and
the
bar
the
the
and
fall
under
consideration
he
stood
for
i
repeat
it
to
take
the
picture
of
him
in
at
one
view
with
his
body
swayed
and
somewhat
bent
forwards
his
right
leg
from
under
him
sustaining
of
his
whole
weight
the
foot
of
his
left
leg
the
defect
of
which
was
no
disadvantage
to
his
attitude
advanced
a
little
not
laterally
nor
forwards
but
in
a
line
betwixt
them
his
knee
bent
but
that
not
violently
but
so
as
to
fall
within
the
limits
of
the
line
of
beauty
and
i
add
of
the
line
of
science
too
for
consider
it
had
one
eighth
part
of
his
body
to
bear
up
so
that
in
this
case
the
position
of
the
leg
is
determined
because
the
foot
could
be
no
farther
advanced
or
the
knee
more
bent
than
what
would
allow
him
mechanically
to
receive
an
eighth
part
of
his
whole
weight
under
it
and
to
carry
it
too
this
i
recommend
to
painters
need
i
add
to
orators
i
think
not
for
unless
they
practise
it
they
must
fall
upon
their
noses
so
much
for
corporal
trim
body
and
he
held
the
sermon
loosely
not
carelessly
in
his
left
hand
raised
something
above
his
stomach
and
detached
a
little
from
his
breast
his
right
arm
falling
negligently
by
his
side
as
nature
and
the
laws
of
gravity
ordered
it
but
with
the
palm
of
it
open
and
turned
towards
his
audience
ready
to
aid
the
sentiment
in
case
it
stood
in
need
corporal
trim
eyes
and
the
muscles
of
his
face
were
in
full
harmony
with
the
other
parts
of
him
he
looked
frank
unconstrained
something
assured
but
not
bordering
upon
assurance
let
not
the
critic
ask
how
corporal
trim
could
come
by
all
told
him
it
should
be
explained
but
so
he
stood
before
my
father
my
uncle
toby
and
slop
so
swayed
his
body
so
contrasted
his
limbs
and
with
such
an
oratorical
sweep
throughout
the
whole
figure
a
statuary
might
have
modelled
from
it
nay
i
doubt
whether
the
oldest
fellow
of
a
college
or
the
hebrew
professor
himself
could
have
much
mended
it
trim
made
a
bow
and
read
as
follows
the
sermon
hebrews
xiii
for
we
trust
we
have
a
good
conscience
trust
we
have
a
good
conscience
certainly
trim
quoth
my
father
interrupting
him
you
give
that
sentence
a
very
improper
accent
for
you
curl
up
your
nose
man
and
read
it
with
such
a
sneering
tone
as
if
the
parson
was
going
to
abuse
the
apostle
he
is
an
please
your
honour
replied
trim
pugh
said
my
father
smiling
sir
quoth
slop
trim
is
certainly
in
the
right
for
the
writer
who
i
perceive
is
a
protestant
by
the
snappish
manner
in
which
he
takes
up
the
apostle
is
certainly
going
to
abuse
him
if
this
treatment
of
him
has
not
done
it
already
but
from
whence
replied
my
father
have
you
concluded
so
soon
slop
that
the
writer
is
of
our
church
for
aught
i
can
see
yet
he
may
be
of
any
because
answered
slop
if
he
was
of
ours
he
durst
no
more
take
such
a
licence
than
a
bear
by
his
beard
if
in
our
communion
sir
a
man
was
to
insult
an
apostle
a
saint
or
even
the
paring
of
a
saint
nail
he
would
have
his
eyes
scratched
what
by
the
saint
quoth
my
uncle
toby
no
replied
slop
he
would
have
an
old
house
over
his
head
pray
is
the
inquisition
an
ancient
building
answered
my
uncle
toby
or
is
it
a
modern
one
i
know
nothing
of
architecture
replied
dr
please
your
honours
quoth
trim
the
inquisition
is
the
vilest
prithee
spare
thy
description
trim
i
hate
the
very
name
of
it
said
my
no
matter
for
that
answered
slop
it
has
its
uses
for
tho
i
no
great
advocate
for
it
yet
in
such
a
case
as
this
he
would
soon
be
taught
better
manners
and
i
can
tell
him
if
he
went
on
at
that
rate
would
be
flung
into
the
inquisition
for
his
pains
god
help
him
then
quoth
my
uncle
toby
amen
added
trim
for
heaven
above
knows
i
have
a
poor
brother
who
has
been
fourteen
years
a
captive
in
i
never
heard
one
word
of
it
before
said
my
uncle
toby
hastily
how
came
he
there
trim
o
sir
the
story
will
make
your
heart
bleed
as
it
has
made
mine
a
thousand
times
but
it
is
too
long
to
be
told
now
your
honour
shall
hear
it
from
first
to
last
some
day
when
i
am
working
beside
you
in
our
fortifications
but
the
short
of
the
story
is
this
that
my
brother
tom
went
over
a
servant
to
lisbon
and
then
married
a
jew
widow
who
kept
a
small
shop
and
sold
sausages
which
somehow
or
other
was
the
cause
of
his
being
taken
in
the
middle
of
the
night
out
of
his
bed
where
he
was
lying
with
his
wife
and
two
small
children
and
carried
directly
to
the
inquisition
where
god
help
him
continued
trim
fetching
a
sigh
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
the
poor
honest
lad
lies
confined
at
this
hour
he
was
as
honest
a
soul
added
trim
pulling
out
his
handkerchief
as
ever
blood
the
tears
trickled
down
trim
cheeks
faster
than
he
could
well
wipe
them
a
dead
silence
in
the
room
ensued
for
some
certain
proof
of
pity
come
trim
quoth
my
father
after
he
saw
the
poor
fellow
grief
had
got
a
little
vent
read
on
and
put
this
melancholy
story
out
of
thy
head
i
grieve
that
i
interrupted
thee
but
prithee
begin
the
sermon
again
for
if
the
first
sentence
in
it
is
matter
of
abuse
as
thou
sayest
i
have
a
great
desire
to
know
what
kind
of
provocation
the
apostle
has
given
corporal
trim
wiped
his
face
and
returned
his
handkerchief
into
his
pocket
and
making
a
bow
as
he
did
it
he
began
again
the
sermon
hebrews
xiii
for
we
trust
we
have
a
good
trust
we
have
a
good
conscience
surely
if
there
is
any
thing
in
this
life
which
a
man
may
depend
upon
and
to
the
knowledge
of
which
he
is
capable
of
arriving
upon
the
most
indisputable
evidence
it
must
be
this
very
thing
whether
he
has
a
good
conscience
or
no
i
am
positive
i
am
right
quoth
dr
slop
a
man
thinks
at
all
he
can
not
well
be
a
stranger
to
the
true
state
of
this
account
he
must
be
privy
to
his
own
thoughts
and
desires
he
must
remember
his
past
pursuits
and
know
certainly
the
true
springs
and
motives
which
in
general
have
governed
the
actions
of
his
life
i
defy
him
without
an
assistant
quoth
dr
slop
other
matters
we
may
be
deceived
by
false
appearances
and
as
the
wise
man
complains
hardly
do
we
guess
aright
at
the
things
that
are
upon
the
earth
and
with
labour
do
we
find
the
things
that
are
before
us
but
here
the
mind
has
all
the
evidence
and
facts
within
herself
is
conscious
of
the
web
she
has
wove
knows
its
texture
and
fineness
and
the
exact
share
which
every
passion
has
had
in
working
upon
the
several
designs
which
virtue
or
vice
has
planned
before
her
the
language
is
good
and
i
declare
trim
reads
very
well
quoth
my
father
as
conscience
is
nothing
else
but
the
knowledge
which
the
mind
has
within
herself
of
this
and
the
judgment
either
of
approbation
or
censure
which
it
unavoidably
makes
upon
the
successive
actions
of
our
lives
is
plain
you
will
say
from
the
very
terms
of
the
proposition
whenever
this
inward
testimony
goes
against
a
man
and
he
stands
that
he
must
necessarily
be
a
guilty
and
on
the
contrary
when
the
report
is
favourable
on
his
side
and
his
heart
condemns
him
not
that
it
is
not
a
matter
of
trust
as
the
apostle
intimates
but
a
matter
of
certainty
and
fact
that
the
conscience
is
good
and
that
the
man
must
be
good
also
then
the
apostle
is
altogether
in
the
wrong
i
suppose
quoth
slop
and
the
protestant
divine
is
in
the
right
sir
have
patience
replied
my
father
for
i
think
it
will
presently
appear
that
paul
and
the
protestant
divine
are
both
of
an
as
nearly
so
quoth
slop
as
east
is
to
west
but
this
continued
he
lifting
both
hands
comes
from
the
liberty
of
the
press
it
is
no
more
at
the
worst
replied
my
uncle
toby
than
the
liberty
of
the
pulpit
for
it
does
not
appear
that
the
sermon
is
printed
or
ever
likely
to
be
go
on
trim
quoth
my
father
first
sight
this
may
seem
to
be
a
true
state
of
the
case
and
i
make
no
doubt
but
the
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
is
so
truly
impressed
upon
the
mind
of
man
that
did
no
such
thing
ever
happen
as
that
the
conscience
of
a
man
by
long
habits
of
sin
might
as
the
scripture
assures
it
may
insensibly
become
hard
and
like
some
tender
parts
of
his
body
by
much
stress
and
continual
hard
usage
lose
by
degrees
that
nice
sense
and
perception
with
which
god
and
nature
endowed
it
did
this
never
happen
or
was
it
certain
that
could
never
hang
the
least
bias
upon
the
judgment
or
that
the
little
interests
below
could
rise
up
and
perplex
the
faculties
of
our
upper
regions
and
encompass
them
about
with
clouds
and
thick
darkness
could
no
such
thing
as
favour
and
affection
enter
this
sacred
court
did
wit
disdain
to
take
a
bribe
in
it
or
was
ashamed
to
shew
its
face
as
an
advocate
for
an
unwarrantable
enjoyment
or
lastly
were
we
assured
that
interest
stood
always
unconcerned
whilst
the
cause
was
hearing
and
that
passion
never
got
into
the
and
pronounced
sentence
in
the
stead
of
reason
which
is
supposed
always
to
preside
and
determine
upon
the
case
was
this
truly
so
as
the
objection
must
suppose
no
doubt
then
the
religious
and
moral
state
of
a
man
would
be
exactly
what
he
himself
esteemed
it
and
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
every
man
life
could
be
known
in
general
by
no
better
measure
than
the
degrees
of
his
own
approbation
and
censure
own
in
one
case
whenever
a
man
conscience
does
accuse
him
as
it
seldom
errs
on
that
side
that
he
is
guilty
and
unless
in
melancholy
and
hypocondriac
cases
we
may
safely
pronounce
upon
it
that
there
is
always
sufficient
grounds
for
the
accusation
the
converse
of
the
proposition
will
not
hold
true
namely
that
whenever
there
is
guilt
the
conscience
must
accuse
and
if
it
does
not
that
a
man
is
therefore
this
is
not
fact
so
that
the
common
consolation
which
some
good
christian
or
other
is
hourly
administering
to
himself
that
he
thanks
god
his
mind
does
not
misgive
him
and
that
consequently
he
has
a
good
conscience
because
he
hath
a
quiet
one
is
fallacious
and
as
current
as
the
inference
is
and
as
infallible
as
the
rule
appears
at
first
sight
yet
when
you
look
nearer
to
it
and
try
the
truth
of
this
rule
upon
plain
facts
you
see
it
liable
to
so
much
error
from
a
false
application
the
principle
upon
which
it
goes
so
often
perverted
the
whole
force
of
it
lost
and
sometimes
so
vilely
cast
away
that
it
is
painful
to
produce
the
common
examples
from
human
life
which
confirm
the
account
man
shall
be
vicious
and
utterly
debauched
in
his
principles
exceptionable
in
his
conduct
to
the
world
shall
live
shameless
in
the
open
commission
of
a
sin
which
no
reason
or
pretence
can
justify
a
sin
by
which
contrary
to
all
the
workings
of
humanity
he
shall
ruin
for
ever
the
deluded
partner
of
his
guilt
rob
her
of
her
best
dowry
and
not
only
cover
her
own
head
with
dishonour
but
involve
a
whole
virtuous
family
in
shame
and
sorrow
for
her
sake
surely
you
will
think
conscience
must
lead
such
a
man
a
troublesome
life
he
can
have
no
rest
night
and
day
from
its
reproaches
conscience
had
something
else
to
do
all
this
time
than
break
in
upon
him
as
elijah
reproached
the
god
baal
this
domestic
god
was
either
talking
or
pursuing
or
was
in
a
journey
or
peradventure
he
slept
and
could
not
be
awoke
he
was
gone
out
in
company
with
honour
to
fight
a
duel
to
pay
off
some
debt
at
play
or
dirty
annuity
the
bargain
of
his
lust
perhaps
conscience
all
this
time
was
engaged
at
home
talking
aloud
against
petty
larceny
and
executing
vengeance
upon
some
such
puny
crimes
as
his
fortune
and
rank
of
life
secured
him
against
all
temptation
of
committing
so
that
he
lives
as
merrily
if
he
was
of
our
church
tho
quoth
slop
he
could
not
as
soundly
in
his
bed
and
at
last
meets
death
unconcernedly
perhaps
much
more
so
than
a
much
better
man
all
this
is
impossible
with
us
quoth
slop
turning
to
my
father
the
case
could
not
happen
in
our
it
happens
in
ours
however
replied
my
father
but
too
i
own
quoth
slop
struck
a
little
with
my
father
frank
acknowledgment
that
a
man
in
the
romish
church
may
live
as
badly
but
then
he
can
not
easily
die
is
little
matter
replied
my
father
with
an
air
of
indifference
how
a
rascal
i
mean
answered
slop
he
would
be
denied
the
benefits
of
the
last
pray
how
many
have
you

my

always

answered
dr

said
my
uncle
toby
tho
not
accented
as
a
note
of
acquiescence
but
as
an
interjection
of
that
particular
species
of
surprize
when
a
man
in
looking
into
a
drawer
finds
more
of
a

my

this

said
slop
interrupting
trim
is
more
detestable
than
all
the

seems
to
have

taken
from
some
pettifogging
lawyer
amongst
you
amongst

a

not
possibly
continue
so
long
blinded
three
times
in

at

he

go

i

quoth
my

even
this

shall
break
through
all
their

of
slow
chicane

the
doubtful
workings

secret
plots
and
cautious
trains
to
bring
about
his
purpose
see
the
villain
how
he
cheats
lies
perjures
robs
murders
horrid
but
indeed
much
better
was
not
to
be
expected
in
the
present
case
the
poor
man
was
in
the
dark
his
priest
had
got
the
keeping
of
his
conscience
and
all
he
would
let
him
know
of
it
was
that
he
must
believe
in
the
pope
go
to
mass
cross
himself
tell
his
beads
be
a
good
catholic
and
that
this
in
all
conscience
was
enough
to
carry
him
to
heaven
what
if
he
perjures
why
he
had
a
mental
reservation
in
but
if
he
is
so
wicked
and
abandoned
a
wretch
as
you
represent
him
if
he
robs
if
he
stabs
will
not
conscience
on
every
such
act
receive
a
wound
itself
aye
but
the
man
has
carried
it
to
confession
the
wound
digests
there
and
will
do
well
enough
and
in
a
short
time
be
quite
healed
up
by
absolution
o

what
hast
thou
to
answer
for
when
not
content
with
the
too
many
natural
and
fatal
ways
thro
which
the
heart
of
man
is
every
day
thus
treacherous
to
itself
above
all
things
thou
hast
wilfully
set
open
the
wide
gate
of
deceit
before
the
face
of
this
unwary
traveller
too
apt
god
knows
to
go
astray
of
himself
and
confidently
speak
peace
to
himself
when
there
is
no
peace
this
the
common
instances
which
i
have
drawn
out
of
life
are
too
notorious
to
require
much
evidence
if
any
man
doubts
the
reality
of
them
or
thinks
it
impossible
for
a
man
to
be
such
a
bubble
to
himself
i
must
refer
him
a
moment
to
his
own
reflections
and
will
then
venture
to
trust
my
appeal
with
his
own
heart
him
consider
in
how
different
a
degree
of
detestation
numbers
of
wicked
actions
stand
there
tho
equally
bad
and
vicious
in
their
own
natures
he
will
soon
find
that
such
of
them
as
strong
inclination
and
custom
have
prompted
him
to
commit
are
generally
dressed
out
and
painted
with
all
the
false
beauties
which
a
soft
and
a
flattering
hand
can
give
them
and
that
the
others
to
which
he
feels
no
propensity
appear
at
once
naked
and
deformed
surrounded
with
all
the
true
circumstances
of
folly
and
dishonour

off

read
his

smote
him
for
what
he
had
done

in
the
matter
of
uriah
where
a
faithful
and
gallant
servant
whom
he
ought
to
have
loved

honoured
fell
to
make
way

his

to
take

whole
year
had
almost
passed
from
first
commission
of
that
crime
to
the
time
nathan
was
sent
to
reprove
him
and
we
read
not
once
of
the
least
sorrow
or
compunction
of
heart
which
he
testified
during
all
that
time
for
what
he
had
done

this
once
able
monitor
placed
on
high
as
a
judge

us
and
intended
by
our
maker
as
a
just
and
equitable
one
too
by
an
unhappy
train
of
causes
and
impediments
takes
often
such
imperfect
cognizance
of
what
passes
does
its
office
so
negligently
sometimes
so
corruptly
that
it
is
not
to
be
trusted
alone
and
therefore
we
find
there
is
a
necessity
an
absolute
necessity
of
joining
another
principle
with
it
to
aid
if
not
govern
its
determinations
that
if
you
would
form
a
just
judgment
of
what
is
of
infinite
importance

you

to
be

in

in
what
degree

an
useful

your

confidence
towards

the
judgment

past

the
judgment
of

an
anticipation

pronounced
upon
thee
hereafter
by
that
being
to

thou
art
finally
to
give
an
account
of

the
man
indeed
then
as
the
author
of
the
book
of
ecclesiasticus
expresses
it
who
is
not
pricked
with
the
multitude
of
his
sins
blessed
is
the

a
heart
thus
guided

at

tell
him
more
than

that

a

no

quoth
my

toby
unless

the
darkest

it
shall
conduct
him
safer
than
a
thousand
casuists
and
give
the

a
better

than
all
the
causes

restrictions
put
together
which
are
forced
to
multiply
forced
i
say
as
things
stand
human
laws
not
being
a
matter
of
original
choice
but
of
pure
necessity
brought
in
to
fence
against
the
mischievous
effects
of
those
consciences
which
are
no
law
unto
themselves
well
intending
by
the
many
provisions
made
that
in
all
such
corrupt
and
misguided
cases
where
principles
and
the
checks
of
conscience
will
not
make
us
upright
to
supply
their
force
and
by
the
terrors
of
gaols
and
halters
oblige
us
to
it
i
see
plainly
said
my
father
that
this
sermon
has
been
composed
to
be
preached
at
the
temple
or
at
some
i
like
the
reasoning
and
am
sorry
that
slop
has
fallen
asleep
before
the
time
of
his
conviction
for
it
is
now
clear
that
the
parson
as
i
thought
at
first
never
insulted
paul
in
the
least
nor
has
there
been
brother
the
least
difference
between
a
great
matter
if
they
had
differed
replied
my
uncle
toby
the
best
friends
in
the
world
may
differ
true
brother
toby
quoth
my
father
shaking
hands
with
him
we
fill
our
pipes
brother
and
then
trim
shall
go
on
well
what
dost
thou
think
of
it
said
my
father
speaking
to
corporal
trim
as
he
reached
his
i
think
answered
the
corporal
that
the
seven
upon
the
tower
who
i
suppose
are
all
centinels
there
are
more
an
please
your
honour
than
were
necessary
and
to
go
on
at
that
rate
would
harrass
a
regiment
all
to
pieces
which
a
commanding
officer
who
loves
his
men
will
never
do
if
he
can
help
it
because
two
centinels
added
the
corporal
are
as
good
as
i
have
been
a
commanding
officer
myself
in
the
corps
de
garde
a
hundred
times
continued
trim
rising
an
inch
higher
in
his
figure
as
he
spoke
and
all
the
time
i
had
the
honour
to
serve
his
majesty
king
william
in
relieving
the
most
considerable
posts
i
never
left
more
than
two
in
my
very
right
trim
quoth
my
uncle
toby
but
you
do
not
consider
trim
that
the
towers
in
solomon
days
were
not
such
things
as
our
bastions
flanked
and
defended
by
other
works
this
trim
was
an
invention
since
solomon
death
nor
had
they
or
ravelins
before
the
curtin
in
his
time
or
such
a
fosse
as
we
make
with
a
cuvette
in
the
middle
of
it
and
with
covered
ways
and
counterscarps
pallisadoed
along
it
to
guard
against
a
coup
de
main
so
that
the
seven
men
upon
the
tower
were
a
party
i
dare
say
from
the
corps
de
garde
set
there
not
only
to
look
out
but
to
defend
they
could
be
no
more
an
please
your
honour
than
a
corporal
my
father
smiled
inwardly
but
not
outwardly
the
subject
being
rather
too
serious
considering
what
had
happened
to
make
a
jest
so
putting
his
pipe
into
his
mouth
which
he
had
just
lighted
he
contented
himself
with
ordering
trim
to
read
on
he
read
on
as
follows
have
the
fear
of
god
before
our
eyes
and
in
our
mutual
dealings
with
each
other
to
govern
our
actions
by
the
eternal
measures
of
right
and
wrong
the
first
of
these
will
comprehend
the
duties
of
religion
the
second
those
of
morality
which
are
so
inseparably
connected
together
that
you
can
not
divide
these
two
tables
even
in
imagination
tho
the
attempt
is
often
made
in
practice
without
breaking
and
mutually
destroying
them
both
i
said
the
attempt
is
often
made
and
so
it
is
there
being
nothing
more
common
than
to
see
a
man
who
has
no
sense
at
all
of
religion
and
indeed
has
so
much
honesty
as
to
pretend
to
none
who
would
take
it
as
the
bitterest
affront
should
you
but
hint
at
a
suspicion
of
his
moral
character
or
imagine
he
was
not
conscientiously
just
and
scrupulous
to
the
uttermost
mite
there
is
some
appearance
that
it
is
so
tho
one
is
unwilling
even
to
suspect
the
appearance
of
so
amiable
a
virtue
as
moral
honesty
yet
were
we
to
look
into
the
grounds
of
it
in
the
present
case
i
am
persuaded
we
should
find
little
reason
to
envy
such
a
one
the
honour
of
his
motive
him
declaim
as
pompously
as
he
chooses
upon
the
subject
it
will
be
found
to
rest
upon
no
better
foundation
than
either
his
interest
his
pride
his
ease
or
some
such
little
and
changeable
passion
as
will
give
us
but
small
dependence
upon
his
actions
in
matters
of
great
distress
will
illustrate
this
by
an
example
know
the
banker
i
deal
with
or
the
physician
i
usually
call
in
there
is
no
need
cried
slop
waking
to
call
in
any
physician
in
this
case
be
neither
of
them
men
of
much
religion
i
hear
them
make
a
jest
of
it
every
day
and
treat
all
its
sanctions
with
so
much
scorn
as
to
put
the
matter
past
doubt
well
notwithstanding
this
i
put
my
fortune
into
the
hands
of
the
one
and
what
is
dearer
still
to
me
i
trust
my
life
to
the
honest
skill
of
the
other
let
me
examine
what
is
my
reason
for
this
great
confidence
why
in
the
first
place
i
believe
there
is
no
probability
that
either
of
them
will
employ
the
power
i
put
into
their
hands
to
my
disadvantage
i
consider
that
honesty
serves
the
purposes
of
this
life
i
know
their
success
in
the
world
depends
upon
the
fairness
of
their
in
a
word
i
persuaded
that
they
can
not
hurt
me
without
hurting
themselves
more
put
it
otherwise
namely
that
interest
lay
for
once
on
the
other
side
that
a
case
should
happen
wherein
the
one
without
stain
to
his
reputation
could
secrete
my
fortune
and
leave
me
naked
in
the
world
or
that
the
other
could
send
me
out
of
it
and
enjoy
an
estate
by
my
death
without
dishonour
to
himself
or
his
art
in
this
case
what
hold
have
i
of
either
of
them
religion
the
strongest
of
all
motives
is
out
of
the
question
interest
the
next
most
powerful
motive
in
the
world
is
strongly
against
me
what
have
i
left
to
cast
into
the
opposite
scale
to
balance
this
temptation
alas
i
have
nothing
nothing
but
what
is
lighter
than
a
bubble
i
must
lie
at
the
mercy
of
honour
or
some
such
capricious
principle
strait
security
for
two
of
the
most
valuable
blessings
my
property
and
myself
therefore
we
can
have
no
dependence
upon
morality
without
religion
so
on
the
other
hand
there
is
nothing
better
to
be
expected
from
religion
without
morality
nevertheless
is
no
prodigy
to
see
a
man
whose
real
moral
character
stands
very
low
who
yet
entertains
the
highest
notion
of
himself
in
the
light
of
a
religious
man
shall
not
only
be
covetous
revengeful
implacable
but
even
wanting
in
points
of
common
honesty
yet
inasmuch
as
he
talks
aloud
against
the
infidelity
of
the
age
is
zealous
for
some
points
of
religion
goes
twice
a
day
to
church
attends
the
sacraments
and
amuses
himself
with
a
few
instrumental
parts
of
religion
shall
cheat
his
conscience
into
a
judgment
that
for
this
he
is
a
religious
man
and
has
discharged
truly
his
duty
to
god
and
you
will
find
that
such
a
man
through
force
of
this
delusion
generally
looks
down
with
spiritual
pride
upon
every
other
man
who
has
less
affectation
of
piety
though
perhaps
ten
times
more
real
honesty
than
himself
likewise
is
a
sore
evil
under
the
sun
and
i
believe
there
is
no
one
mistaken
principle
which
for
its
time
has
wrought
more
serious
for
a
general
proof
of
this
examine
the
history
of
the
romish
church
well
what
can
you
make
of
that
cried
slop
what
scenes
of
cruelty
murder
rapine
bloodshed
they
may
thank
their
own
obstinacy
cried
slop
have
all
been
sanctified
by
a
religion
not
strictly
governed
by
morality
how
many
kingdoms
of
the
world
here
trim
kept
waving
his
from
the
sermon
to
the
extent
of
his
arm
returning
it
backwards
and
forwards
to
the
conclusion
of
the
paragraph
how
many
kingdoms
of
the
world
has
the
crusading
sword
of
this
misguided
spared
neither
age
or
merit
or
sex
or
condition
and
as
he
fought
under
the
banners
of
a
religion
which
set
him
loose
from
justice
and
humanity
he
shewed
none
mercilessly
trampled
upon
both
heard
neither
the
cries
of
the
unfortunate
nor
pitied
their
distresses
i
have
been
in
many
a
battle
an
please
your
honour
quoth
trim
sighing
but
never
in
so
melancholy
a
one
as
this
i
would
not
have
drawn
a
tricker
in
it
against
these
poor
souls
to
have
been
made
a
general
why
what
do
you
understand
of
the
affair
said
slop
looking
towards
trim
with
something
more
of
contempt
than
the
corporal
honest
heart
what
do
you
know
friend
about
this
battle
you
talk
of
i
know
replied
trim
that
i
never
refused
quarter
in
my
life
to
any
man
who
cried
out
for
it
but
to
a
woman
or
a
child
continued
trim
before
i
would
level
my
musket
at
them
i
would
loose
my
life
a
thousand
here
a
crown
for
thee
trim
to
drink
with
obadiah
quoth
my
uncle
toby
and
i
give
obadiah
another
god
bless
your
honour
replied
trim
i
had
rather
these
poor
women
and
children
had
thou
art
an
honest
fellow
quoth
my
uncle
my
father
nodded
his
head
as
much
as
to
say
and
so
he
but
prithee
trim
said
my
father
make
an
end
for
i
see
thou
hast
but
a
leaf
or
two
left
corporal
trim
read
on
the
testimony
of
past
centuries
in
this
matter
is
not
sufficient
consider
at
this
instant
how
the
votaries
of
that
religion
are
every
day
thinking
to
do
service
and
honour
to
god
by
actions
which
are
a
dishonour
and
scandal
to
themselves
be
convinced
of
this
go
with
me
for
a
moment
into
the
prisons
of
the
inquisition
god
help
my
poor
brother
tom
religion
with
mercy
and
justice
chained
down
under
her
feet
there
sitting
ghastly
upon
a
black
tribunal
propped
up
with
racks
and
instruments
of
torment
hark
hark
what
a
piteous
groan
here
trim
face
turned
as
pale
as
ashes
the
melancholy
wretch
who
uttered
it
here
the
tears
began
to
trickle
down
brought
forth
to
undergo
the
anguish
of
a
mock
trial
and
endure
the
utmost
pains
that
a
studied
system
of
cruelty
has
been
able
to
invent
them
all
quoth
trim
his
colour
returning
into
his
face
as
red
as
blood
this
helpless
victim
delivered
up
to
his
tormentors
his
body
so
wasted
with
sorrow
and
oh
is
my
brother
cried
poor
trim
in
a
most
passionate
exclamation
dropping
the
sermon
upon
the
ground
and
clapping
his
hands
together
i
fear
is
poor
tom
my
father
and
my
uncle
toby
heart
yearned
with
sympathy
for
the
poor
fellow
distress
even
slop
himself
acknowledged
pity
for
why
trim
said
my
father
this
is
not
a
history
is
a
sermon
thou
art
reading
prithee
begin
the
sentence
again
this
helpless
victim
delivered
up
to
his
tormentors
his
body
so
wasted
with
sorrow
and
confinement
you
will
see
every
nerve
and
muscle
as
it
suffers
the
last
movement
of
that
horrid
engine
i
would
rather
face
a
cannon
quoth
trim
stamping
what
convulsions
it
has
thrown
him
into
consider
the
nature
of
the
posture
in
which
he
how
lies
stretched
what
exquisite
tortures
he
endures
by
it
i
hope
is
not
in
portugal
all
nature
can
bear
good
god
see
how
it
keeps
his
weary
soul
hanging
upon
his
trembling
lips
i
would
not
read
another
line
of
it
quoth
trim
for
all
this
world
i
fear
an
please
your
honours
all
this
is
in
portugal
where
my
poor
brother
tom
is
i
tell
thee
trim
again
quoth
my
father
is
not
an
historical
account
is
a
is
only
a
description
honest
man
quoth
slop
there
not
a
word
of
truth
in
that
another
story
replied
my
however
as
trim
reads
it
with
so
much
concern
is
cruelty
to
force
him
to
go
on
with
give
me
hold
of
the
sermon
trim
i
finish
it
for
thee
and
thou
go
i
must
stay
and
hear
it
too
replied
trim
if
your
honour
will
allow
me
i
would
not
read
it
myself
for
a
colonel
poor
trim
quoth
my
uncle
toby
my
father
went
on
consider
the
nature
of
the
posture
in
which
he
now
lies
stretched
what
exquisite
torture
he
endures
by
it
is
all
nature
can
bear
good
god
see
how
it
keeps
his
weary
soul
hanging
upon
his
trembling
lips
willing
to
take
its
leave
but
not
suffered
to
depart
behold
the
unhappy
wretch
led
back
to
his
cell
then
thank
god
however
quoth
trim
they
have
not
killed
him
him
dragged
out
of
it
again
to
meet
the
flames
and
the
insults
in
his
last
agonies
which
this
principle
this
principle
that
there
can
be
religion
without
mercy
has
prepared
for
him
then
thank
god
he
is
dead
quoth
trim
he
is
out
of
his
pain
and
they
have
done
their
worst
at
o
sirs
hold
your
peace
trim
said
my
father
going
on
with
the
sermon
lest
trim
should
incense
slop
we
shall
never
have
done
at
this
rate
surest
way
to
try
the
merit
of
any
disputed
notion
is
to
trace
down
the
consequences
such
a
notion
has
produced
and
compare
them
with
the
spirit
of
christianity
is
the
short
and
decisive
rule
which
our
saviour
hath
left
us
for
these
and
such
like
cases
and
it
is
worth
a
thousand
arguments
by
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them
will
add
no
farther
to
the
length
of
this
sermon
than
by
two
or
three
short
and
independent
rules
deducible
from
it
whenever
a
man
talks
loudly
against
religion
always
suspect
that
it
is
not
his
reason
but
his
passions
which
have
got
the
better
of
his
creed
a
bad
life
and
a
good
belief
are
disagreeable
and
troublesome
neighbours
and
where
they
separate
depend
upon
it
is
for
no
other
cause
but
quietness
sake
when
a
man
thus
represented
tells
you
in
any
particular
instance
that
such
a
thing
goes
against
his
conscience
always
believe
he
means
exactly
the
same
thing
as
when
he
tells
you
such
a
thing
goes
against
his
stomach
a
present
want
of
appetite
being
generally
the
true
cause
of
both
a
word
trust
that
man
in
nothing
who
has
not
a
conscience
in
every
thing
in
your
own
case
remember
this
plain
distinction
a
mistake
in
which
has
ruined
thousands
that
your
conscience
is
not
a
law
no
god
and
reason
made
the
law
and
have
placed
conscience
within
you
to
determine
not
like
an
asiatic
cadi
according
to
the
ebbs
and
flows
of
his
own
passions
but
like
a
british
judge
in
this
land
of
liberty
and
good
sense
who
makes
no
new
law
but
faithfully
declares
that
law
which
he
knows
already
written
finis
thou
hast
read
the
sermon
extremely
well
trim
quoth
my
if
he
had
spared
his
comments
replied
slop
he
would
have
read
it
much
better
i
should
have
read
it
ten
times
better
sir
answered
trim
but
that
my
heart
was
so
that
was
the
very
reason
trim
replied
my
father
which
has
made
thee
read
the
sermon
as
well
as
thou
hast
done
and
if
the
clergy
of
our
church
continued
my
father
addressing
himself
to
slop
would
take
part
in
what
they
deliver
as
deeply
as
this
poor
fellow
has
done
as
their
compositions
are
fine
i
deny
it
quoth
slop
i
maintain
it
that
the
eloquence
of
our
pulpits
with
such
subjects
to
enflame
it
would
be
a
model
for
the
whole
world
but
alas
continued
my
father
and
i
own
it
sir
with
sorrow
that
like
french
politicians
in
this
respect
what
they
gain
in
the
cabinet
they
lose
in
the
a
pity
quoth
my
uncle
that
this
should
be
lost
i
like
the
sermon
well
replied
my
father
is
dramatick
and
there
is
something
in
that
way
of
writing
when
skilfully
managed
which
catches
the
we
preach
much
in
that
way
with
us
said
dr
i
know
that
very
well
said
my
father
but
in
a
tone
and
manner
which
disgusted
slop
full
as
much
as
his
assent
simply
could
have
pleased
but
in
this
added
slop
a
little
piqued
our
sermons
have
greatly
the
advantage
that
we
never
introduce
any
character
into
them
below
a
patriarch
or
a
patriarch
wife
or
a
martyr
or
a
there
are
some
very
bad
characters
in
this
however
said
my
father
and
i
do
not
think
the
sermon
a
jot
the
worse
for
but
pray
quoth
my
uncle
toby
who
can
this
be
how
could
it
get
into
my
stevinus
a
man
must
be
as
great
a
conjurer
as
stevinus
said
my
father
to
resolve
the
second
question
the
first
i
think
is
not
so
difficult
for
unless
my
judgment
greatly
deceives
me
i
know
the
author
for
is
wrote
certainly
by
the
parson
of
the
parish
the
similitude
of
the
stile
and
manner
of
it
with
those
my
father
constantly
had
heard
preached
in
his
was
the
ground
of
his
conjecture
proving
it
as
strongly
as
an
argument
a
priori
could
prove
such
a
thing
to
a
philosophic
mind
that
it
was
yorick
and
no
one
else
it
was
proved
to
be
so
a
posteriori
the
day
after
when
yorick
sent
a
servant
to
my
uncle
toby
house
to
enquire
after
it
it
seems
that
yorick
who
was
inquisitive
after
all
kinds
of
knowledge
had
borrowed
stevinus
of
my
uncle
toby
and
had
carelesly
popped
his
sermon
as
soon
as
he
had
made
it
into
the
middle
of
stevinus
and
by
an
act
of
forgetfulness
to
which
he
was
ever
subject
he
had
sent
stevinus
home
and
his
sermon
to
keep
him
company
sermon
thou
wast
lost
after
this
recovery
of
thee
a
second
time
dropped
thru
an
unsuspected
fissure
in
thy
master
pocket
down
into
a
treacherous
and
a
tattered
lining
trod
deep
into
the
dirt
by
the
left
of
his
rosinante
inhumanly
stepping
upon
thee
as
thou
falledst
buried
ten
days
in
the
mire
raised
up
out
of
it
by
a
beggar
sold
for
a
halfpenny
to
a
transferred
to
his
parson
lost
for
ever
to
thy
own
the
remainder
of
his
days
nor
restored
to
his
restless
manes
till
this
very
moment
that
i
tell
the
world
the
story
can
the
reader
believe
that
this
sermon
of
yorick
was
preached
at
an
assize
in
the
cathedral
of
york
before
a
thousand
witnesses
ready
to
give
oath
of
it
by
a
certain
prebendary
of
that
church
and
actually
printed
by
him
when
he
had
done
and
within
so
short
a
space
as
two
years
and
three
months
after
yorick
death
yorick
indeed
was
never
better
served
in
his
life
but
it
was
a
little
hard
to
maltreat
him
after
and
plunder
him
after
he
was
laid
in
his
grave
however
as
the
gentleman
who
did
it
was
in
perfect
charity
with
yorick
and
in
conscious
justice
printed
but
a
few
copies
to
give
away
and
that
i
am
told
he
could
moreover
have
made
as
good
a
one
himself
had
he
thought
fit
i
declare
i
would
not
have
published
this
anecdote
to
the
world
nor
do
i
publish
it
with
an
intent
to
hurt
his
character
and
advancement
in
the
church
i
leave
that
to
others
but
i
find
myself
impelled
by
two
reasons
which
i
can
not
withstand
the
first
is
that
in
doing
justice
i
may
give
rest
to
ghost
which
as
the
and
some
others
believe
still
walks
the
second
reason
is
that
by
laying
open
this
story
to
the
world
i
gain
an
opportunity
of
informing
it
that
in
case
the
character
of
parson
yorick
and
this
sample
of
his
sermons
is
liked
there
are
now
in
the
possession
of
the
shandy
family
as
many
as
will
make
a
handsome
volume
at
the
world
service
and
much
good
may
they
do
it
chapter
obadiah
gained
the
two
crowns
without
dispute
for
he
came
in
jingling
with
all
the
instruments
in
the
green
baize
bag
we
spoke
of
flung
across
his
body
just
as
corporal
trim
went
out
of
the
room
it
is
now
proper
i
think
quoth
slop
clearing
up
his
looks
as
we
are
in
a
condition
to
be
of
some
service
to
shandy
to
send
up
stairs
to
know
how
she
goes
on
i
have
ordered
answered
my
father
the
old
midwife
to
come
down
to
us
upon
the
least
difficulty
for
you
must
know
slop
continued
my
father
with
a
perplexed
kind
of
a
smile
upon
his
countenance
that
by
express
treaty
solemnly
ratified
between
me
and
my
wife
you
are
no
more
than
an
auxiliary
in
this
affair
and
not
so
much
as
that
unless
the
lean
old
mother
of
a
midwife
above
stairs
can
not
do
without
women
have
their
particular
fancies
and
in
points
of
this
nature
continued
my
father
where
they
bear
the
whole
burden
and
suffer
so
much
acute
pain
for
the
advantage
of
our
families
and
the
good
of
the
species
they
claim
a
right
of
deciding
en
souveraines
in
whose
hands
and
in
what
fashion
they
choose
to
undergo
it
they
are
in
the
right
of
it
quoth
my
uncle
toby
but
sir
replied
slop
not
taking
notice
of
my
uncle
toby
opinion
but
turning
to
my
father
they
had
better
govern
in
other
points
and
a
father
of
a
family
who
wishes
its
perpetuity
in
my
opinion
had
better
exchange
this
prerogative
with
them
and
give
up
some
other
rights
in
lieu
of
i
know
not
quoth
my
father
answering
a
letter
too
testily
to
be
quite
dispassionate
in
what
he
said
i
know
not
quoth
he
what
we
have
left
to
give
up
in
lieu
of
who
shall
bring
our
children
into
the
world
unless
that
of
who
shall
beget
one
would
almost
give
up
any
thing
replied
dr
i
beg
your
pardon
answered
my
uncle
sir
replied
slop
it
would
astonish
you
to
know
what
improvements
we
have
made
of
late
years
in
all
branches
of
obstetrical
knowledge
but
particularly
in
that
one
single
point
of
the
safe
and
expeditious
extraction
of
the
foetus
which
has
received
such
lights
that
for
my
part
holding
up
his
hand
i
declare
i
wonder
how
the
world
has
i
wish
quoth
my
uncle
toby
you
had
seen
what
prodigious
armies
we
had
in
flanders
chapter
i
have
dropped
the
curtain
over
this
scene
for
a
minute
to
remind
you
of
one
thing
and
to
inform
you
of
another
what
i
have
to
inform
you
comes
i
own
a
little
out
of
its
due
course
for
it
should
have
been
told
a
hundred
and
fifty
pages
ago
but
that
i
foresaw
then
come
in
pat
hereafter
and
be
of
more
advantage
here
than
writers
had
need
look
before
them
to
keep
up
the
spirit
and
connection
of
what
they
have
in
hand
when
these
two
things
are
done
the
curtain
shall
be
drawn
up
again
and
my
uncle
toby
my
father
and
slop
shall
go
on
with
their
discourse
without
any
more
interruption
first
then
the
matter
which
i
have
to
remind
you
of
is
this
that
from
the
specimens
of
singularity
in
my
father
notions
in
the
point
of
and
that
other
previous
point
thereto
you
was
led
i
think
into
an
opinion
and
i
am
sure
i
said
as
much
that
my
father
was
a
gentleman
altogether
as
odd
and
whimsical
in
fifty
other
opinions
in
truth
there
was
not
a
stage
in
the
life
of
man
from
the
very
first
act
of
his
begetting
down
to
the
lean
and
slippered
pantaloon
in
his
second
childishness
but
he
had
some
favourite
notion
to
himself
springing
out
of
it
as
sceptical
and
as
far
out
of
the
of
thinking
as
these
two
which
have
been
explained
shandy
my
father
sir
would
see
nothing
in
the
light
in
which
others
placed
it
he
placed
things
in
his
own
light
he
would
weigh
nothing
in
common
scales
no
he
was
too
refined
a
researcher
to
lie
open
to
so
gross
an
to
come
at
the
exact
weight
of
things
in
the
scientific
the
fulcrum
he
would
say
should
be
almost
invisible
to
avoid
all
friction
from
popular
tenets
without
this
the
minutiae
of
philosophy
which
would
always
turn
the
balance
will
have
no
weight
at
all
knowledge
like
matter
he
would
affirm
was
divisible
in
infinitum
that
the
grains
and
scruples
were
as
much
a
part
of
it
as
the
gravitation
of
the
whole
in
a
word
he
would
say
error
was
error
no
matter
where
it
fell
whether
in
a
fraction
or
a
pound
was
alike
fatal
to
truth
and
she
was
kept
down
at
the
bottom
of
her
well
as
inevitably
by
a
mistake
in
the
dust
of
a
butterfly
wing
as
in
the
disk
of
the
sun
the
moon
and
all
the
stars
of
heaven
put
together
he
would
often
lament
that
it
was
for
want
of
considering
this
properly
and
of
applying
it
skilfully
to
civil
matters
as
well
as
to
speculative
truths
that
so
many
things
in
this
world
were
out
of
joint
that
the
political
arch
was
giving
way
and
that
the
very
foundations
of
our
excellent
constitution
in
church
and
state
were
so
sapped
as
estimators
had
reported
you
cry
out
he
would
say
we
are
a
ruined
undone
people
why
he
would
ask
making
use
of
the
sorites
or
syllogism
of
zeno
and
chrysippus
without
knowing
it
belonged
to
why
why
are
we
a
ruined
people
because
we
are
whence
is
it
dear
sir
that
we
are
corrupted
because
we
are
needy
our
poverty
and
not
our
wills
and
wherefore
he
would
add
are
we
needy
from
the
neglect
he
would
answer
of
our
pence
and
our
halfpence
our
bank
notes
sir
our
guineas
nay
our
shillings
take
care
of
themselves
is
the
same
he
would
say
throughout
the
whole
circle
of
the
sciences
the
great
the
established
points
of
them
are
not
to
be
broke
in
the
laws
of
nature
will
defend
themselves
but
error
he
would
add
looking
earnestly
at
my
mother
error
sir
creeps
in
thro
the
minute
holes
and
small
crevices
which
human
nature
leaves
unguarded
this
turn
of
thinking
in
my
father
is
what
i
had
to
remind
you
of
the
point
you
are
to
be
informed
of
and
which
i
have
reserved
for
this
place
is
as
follows
amongst
the
many
and
excellent
reasons
with
which
my
father
had
urged
my
mother
to
accept
of
slop
assistance
preferably
to
that
of
the
old
woman
there
was
one
of
a
very
singular
nature
which
when
he
had
done
arguing
the
matter
with
her
as
a
christian
and
came
to
argue
it
over
again
with
her
as
a
philosopher
he
had
put
his
whole
strength
to
depending
indeed
upon
it
as
his
it
failed
him
tho
from
no
defect
in
the
argument
itself
but
that
do
what
he
could
he
was
not
able
for
his
soul
to
make
her
comprehend
the
drift
of
cursed
luck
said
he
to
himself
one
afternoon
as
he
walked
out
of
the
room
after
he
had
been
stating
it
for
an
hour
and
a
half
to
her
to
no
manner
of
purpose
cursed
luck
said
he
biting
his
lip
as
he
shut
the
door
for
a
man
to
be
master
of
one
of
the
finest
chains
of
reasoning
in
nature
and
have
a
wife
at
the
same
time
with
such
a
that
he
can
not
hang
up
a
single
inference
within
side
of
it
to
save
his
soul
from
destruction
this
argument
though
it
was
entirely
lost
upon
my
mother
had
more
weight
with
him
than
all
his
other
arguments
joined
together
i
will
therefore
endeavour
to
do
it
justice
and
set
it
forth
with
all
the
perspicuity
i
am
master
of
my
father
set
out
upon
the
strength
of
these
two
following
axioms
first
that
an
ounce
of
a
man
own
wit
was
worth
a
ton
of
other
people
and
secondly
which
by
the
bye
was
the
of
the
first
axiom
tho
it
comes
last
that
every
man
wit
must
come
from
every
man
own
soul
and
no
other
body
now
as
it
was
plain
to
my
father
that
all
souls
were
by
nature
equal
and
that
the
great
difference
between
the
most
acute
and
the
most
obtuse
understanding
was
from
no
original
sharpness
or
bluntness
of
one
thinking
substance
above
or
below
another
but
arose
merely
from
the
lucky
or
unlucky
organization
of
the
body
in
that
part
where
the
soul
principally
took
up
her
residence
he
had
made
it
the
subject
of
his
enquiry
to
find
out
the
identical
place
now
from
the
best
accounts
he
had
been
able
to
get
of
this
matter
he
was
satisfied
it
could
not
be
where
des
cartes
had
fixed
it
upon
the
top
of
the
pineal
gland
of
the
brain
which
as
he
philosophized
formed
a
cushion
for
her
about
the
size
of
a
marrow
pea
tho
to
speak
the
truth
as
so
many
nerves
did
terminate
all
in
that
one
place
was
no
bad
conjecture
and
my
father
had
certainly
fallen
with
that
great
philosopher
plumb
into
the
centre
of
the
mistake
had
it
not
been
for
my
uncle
toby
who
rescued
him
out
of
it
by
a
story
he
told
him
of
a
walloon
officer
at
the
battle
of
landen
who
had
one
part
of
his
brain
shot
away
by
a
and
another
part
of
it
taken
out
after
by
a
french
surgeon
and
after
all
recovered
and
did
his
duty
very
well
without
it
if
death
said
my
father
reasoning
with
himself
is
nothing
but
the
separation
of
the
soul
from
the
body
and
if
it
is
true
that
people
can
walk
about
and
do
their
business
without
brains
then
certes
the
soul
does
not
inhabit
there
as
for
that
certain
very
thin
subtle
and
very
fragrant
juice
which
coglionissimo
borri
the
great
milaneze
physician
affirms
in
a
letter
to
bartholine
to
have
discovered
in
the
cellulae
of
the
occipital
parts
of
the
cerebellum
and
which
he
likewise
affirms
to
be
the
principal
seat
of
the
reasonable
soul
for
you
must
know
in
these
latter
and
more
enlightened
ages
there
are
two
souls
in
every
man
living
the
one
according
to
the
great
metheglingius
being
called
the
animus
the
other
the
anima
as
for
the
opinion
i
say
of
borri
my
father
could
never
subscribe
to
it
by
any
means
the
very
idea
of
so
noble
so
refined
so
immaterial
and
so
exalted
a
being
as
the
anima
or
even
the
animus
taking
up
her
residence
and
sitting
dabbling
like
a
all
day
long
both
summer
and
winter
in
a
puddle
or
in
a
liquid
of
any
kind
how
thick
or
thin
soever
he
would
say
shocked
his
imagination
he
would
scarce
give
the
doctrine
a
hearing
what
therefore
seemed
the
least
liable
to
objections
of
any
was
that
the
chief
sensorium
or
of
the
soul
and
to
which
place
all
intelligences
were
referred
and
from
whence
all
her
mandates
were
issued
was
in
or
near
the
cerebellum
or
rather
somewhere
about
the
medulla
oblongata
wherein
it
was
generally
agreed
by
dutch
anatomists
that
all
the
minute
nerves
from
all
the
organs
of
the
seven
senses
concentered
like
streets
and
winding
alleys
into
a
square
so
far
there
was
nothing
singular
in
my
father
opinion
he
had
the
best
of
philosophers
of
all
ages
and
climates
to
go
along
with
but
here
he
took
a
road
of
his
own
setting
up
another
shandean
hypothesis
upon
these
they
had
laid
for
him
and
which
said
hypothesis
equally
stood
its
ground
whether
the
subtilty
and
fineness
of
the
soul
depended
upon
the
temperature
and
clearness
of
the
said
liquor
or
of
the
finer
and
texture
in
the
cerebellum
itself
which
opinion
he
favoured
he
maintained
that
next
to
the
due
care
to
be
taken
in
the
act
of
propagation
of
each
individual
which
required
all
the
thought
in
the
world
as
it
laid
the
foundation
of
this
incomprehensible
contexture
in
which
wit
memory
fancy
eloquence
and
what
is
usually
meant
by
the
name
of
good
natural
parts
do
consist
that
next
to
this
and
his
which
were
the
two
original
and
most
efficacious
causes
of
all
that
the
third
cause
or
rather
what
logicians
call
the
causa
sina
qua
non
and
without
which
all
that
was
done
was
of
no
manner
of
significance
was
the
preservation
of
this
delicate
and
web
from
the
havock
which
was
generally
made
in
it
by
the
violent
compression
and
crush
which
the
head
was
made
to
undergo
by
the
nonsensical
method
of
bringing
us
into
the
world
by
that
foremost
this
requires
explanation
my
father
who
dipped
into
all
kinds
of
books
upon
looking
into
lithopaedus
senonesis
de
portu
difficili
the
author
is
here
twice
mistaken
for
lithopaedus
should
be
wrote
thus
lithopaedii
senonensis
icon
the
second
mistake
is
that
this
lithopaedus
is
not
an
author
but
a
drawing
of
a
petrified
child
the
account
of
this
published
by
athosius
may
be
seen
at
the
end
of
cordaeus
works
in
spachius
tristram
shandy
has
been
led
into
this
error
either
from
seeing
lithopaedus
name
of
late
in
a
catalogue
of
learned
writers
in
dr
or
by
mistaking
lithopaedus
for
trinecavellius
from
the
too
great
similitude
of
the
names
published
by
adrianus
smelvgot
had
found
out
that
the
lax
and
pliable
state
of
a
child
head
in
parturition
the
bones
of
the
cranium
having
no
sutures
at
that
time
was
such
that
by
force
of
the
woman
efforts
which
in
strong
was
equal
upon
an
average
to
the
weight
of
pounds
avoirdupois
acting
perpendicularly
upon
it
it
so
happened
that
in
instances
out
of
the
said
head
was
compressed
and
moulded
into
the
shape
of
an
oblong
conical
piece
of
dough
such
as
a
generally
rolls
up
in
order
to
make
a
pye
good
god
cried
my
father
what
havock
and
destruction
must
this
make
in
the
infinitely
fine
and
tender
texture
of
the
cerebellum
or
if
there
is
such
a
juice
as
borri
pretends
is
it
not
enough
to
make
the
clearest
liquid
in
the
world
both
seculent
and
mothery
but
how
great
was
his
apprehension
when
he
farther
understood
that
this
force
acting
upon
the
very
vertex
of
the
head
not
only
injured
the
brain
itself
or
cerebrum
but
that
it
necessarily
squeezed
and
propelled
the
cerebrum
towards
the
cerebellum
which
was
the
immediate
seat
of
the
understanding
angels
and
ministers
of
grace
defend
us
cried
my
father
can
any
soul
withstand
this
shock
no
wonder
the
intellectual
web
is
so
rent
and
tattered
as
we
see
it
and
that
so
many
of
our
best
heads
are
no
better
than
a
puzzled
skein
of
silk
all
perplexity
all
confusion
but
when
my
father
read
on
and
was
let
into
the
secret
that
when
a
child
was
turned
which
was
easy
for
an
operator
to
do
and
was
extracted
by
the
feet
that
instead
of
the
cerebrum
being
propelled
towards
the
cerebellum
the
cerebellum
on
the
contrary
was
propelled
simply
towards
the
cerebrum
where
it
could
do
no
manner
of
hurt
by
heavens
cried
he
the
world
is
in
conspiracy
to
drive
out
what
little
wit
god
has
given
us
and
the
professors
of
the
obstetric
art
are
listed
into
the
same
what
is
it
to
me
which
end
of
my
son
comes
foremost
into
the
world
provided
all
goes
right
after
and
his
cerebellum
escapes
uncrushed
it
is
the
nature
of
an
hypothesis
when
once
a
man
has
conceived
it
that
it
assimilates
every
thing
to
itself
as
proper
nourishment
and
from
the
first
moment
of
your
begetting
it
it
generally
grows
the
stronger
by
every
thing
you
see
hear
read
or
understand
this
is
of
great
use
when
my
father
was
gone
with
this
about
a
month
there
was
scarce
a
phaenomenon
of
stupidity
or
of
genius
which
he
could
not
readily
solve
by
it
it
accounted
for
the
eldest
son
being
the
greatest
blockhead
in
the
poor
devil
he
would
say
he
made
way
for
the
capacity
of
his
younger
it
unriddled
the
observations
of
drivellers
and
monstrous
heads
shewing
a
priori
it
could
not
be
otherwise
unless
i
do
know
what
it
wonderfully
explained
and
accounted
for
the
acumen
of
the
asiatic
genius
and
that
sprightlier
turn
and
a
more
penetrating
intuition
of
minds
in
warmer
climates
not
from
the
loose
and
solution
of
a
clearer
sky
and
a
more
perpetual
sunshine
which
for
aught
he
knew
might
as
well
rarefy
and
dilute
the
faculties
of
the
soul
into
nothing
by
one
extreme
as
they
are
condensed
in
colder
climates
by
the
other
but
he
traced
the
affair
up
to
its
shewed
that
in
warmer
climates
nature
had
laid
a
lighter
tax
upon
the
fairest
parts
of
the
creation
their
pleasures
more
the
necessity
of
their
pains
less
insomuch
that
the
pressure
and
resistance
upon
the
vertex
was
so
slight
that
the
whole
organization
of
the
cerebellum
was
preserved
nay
he
did
not
believe
in
natural
births
that
so
much
as
a
single
thread
of
the
was
broke
or
displaced
so
that
the
soul
might
just
act
as
she
liked
when
my
father
had
got
so
far
what
a
blaze
of
light
did
the
accounts
of
the
caesarian
section
and
of
the
towering
geniuses
who
had
come
safe
into
the
world
by
it
cast
upon
this
hypothesis
here
you
see
he
would
say
there
was
no
injury
done
to
the
sensorium
no
pressure
of
the
head
against
the
pelvis
no
propulsion
of
the
cerebrum
towards
the
cerebellum
either
by
the
os
pubis
on
this
side
or
os
coxygis
on
that
and
pray
what
were
the
happy
consequences
why
sir
your
julius
caesar
who
gave
the
operation
a
name
and
your
hermes
trismegistus
who
was
born
so
before
ever
the
operation
had
a
name
your
scipio
africanus
your
manlius
torquatus
our
edward
the
sixth
who
had
he
lived
would
have
done
the
same
honour
to
the
hypothesis
these
and
many
more
who
figured
high
in
the
annals
of
fame
all
came
sir
into
the
world
the
incision
of
the
abdomen
and
uterus
ran
for
six
weeks
together
in
my
father
head
he
had
read
and
was
satisfied
that
wounds
in
the
epigastrium
and
those
in
the
matrix
were
not
mortal
so
that
the
belly
of
the
mother
might
be
opened
extremely
well
to
give
a
passage
to
the
he
mentioned
the
thing
one
afternoon
to
my
mother
merely
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
seeing
her
turn
as
pale
as
ashes
at
the
very
mention
of
it
as
much
as
the
operation
flattered
his
hopes
he
thought
it
as
well
to
say
no
more
of
it
contenting
himself
with
admiring
what
he
thought
was
to
no
purpose
to
propose
this
was
my
father
shandy
hypothesis
concerning
which
i
have
only
to
add
that
my
brother
bobby
did
as
great
honour
to
it
whatever
he
did
to
the
family
as
any
one
of
the
great
heroes
we
spoke
of
for
happening
not
only
to
be
christened
as
i
told
you
but
to
be
born
too
when
my
father
was
at
epsom
being
moreover
my
mother
first
child
coming
into
the
world
with
his
head
foremost
and
turning
out
afterwards
a
lad
of
wonderful
slow
parts
my
father
spelt
all
these
together
into
his
opinion
and
as
he
had
failed
at
one
end
he
was
determined
to
try
the
other
this
was
not
to
be
expected
from
one
of
the
sisterhood
who
are
not
easily
to
be
put
out
of
their
way
and
was
therefore
one
of
my
great
reasons
in
favour
of
a
man
of
science
whom
he
could
better
deal
with
of
all
men
in
the
world
slop
was
the
fittest
for
my
purpose
for
though
this
forceps
was
the
armour
he
had
proved
and
what
he
maintained
to
be
the
safest
instrument
of
deliverance
yet
it
seems
he
had
scattered
a
word
or
two
in
his
book
in
favour
of
the
very
thing
which
ran
in
my
father
fancy
tho
not
with
a
view
to
the
soul
good
in
extracting
by
the
feet
as
was
my
father
system
but
for
reasons
merely
obstetrical
this
will
account
for
the
coalition
betwixt
my
father
and
slop
in
the
ensuing
discourse
which
went
a
little
hard
against
my
uncle
in
what
manner
a
plain
man
with
nothing
but
common
sense
could
bear
up
against
two
such
allies
in
science
is
hard
to
you
may
conjecture
upon
it
if
you
please
and
whilst
your
imagination
is
in
motion
you
may
encourage
it
to
go
on
and
discover
by
what
causes
and
effects
in
nature
it
could
come
to
pass
that
my
uncle
toby
got
his
modesty
by
the
wound
he
received
upon
his
you
may
raise
a
system
to
account
for
the
loss
of
my
nose
by
and
shew
the
world
how
it
could
happen
that
i
should
have
the
misfortune
to
be
called
tristram
in
opposition
to
my
father
hypothesis
and
the
wish
of
the
whole
family
godfathers
and
godmothers
not
these
with
fifty
other
points
left
yet
unravelled
you
may
endeavour
to
solve
if
you
have
time
but
i
tell
you
beforehand
it
will
be
in
vain
for
not
the
sage
alquise
the
magician
in
don
belianis
of
greece
nor
the
no
less
famous
urganda
the
sorceress
his
wife
were
they
alive
could
pretend
to
come
within
a
league
of
the
truth
the
reader
will
be
content
to
wait
for
a
full
explanation
of
these
matters
till
the
next
year
when
a
series
of
things
will
be
laid
open
which
he
little
expects
chapter
wish
slop
quoth
my
uncle
toby
repeating
his
wish
for
slop
a
second
time
and
with
a
degree
of
more
zeal
and
earnestness
in
his
manner
of
wishing
than
he
had
wished
at
first
vide
wish
slop
quoth
my
uncle
toby
had
seen
what
prodigious
armies
we
had
in
flanders
my
uncle
toby
wish
did
slop
a
disservice
which
his
heart
never
intended
any
man
sir
it
confounded
him
and
thereby
putting
his
ideas
first
into
confusion
and
then
to
flight
he
could
not
rally
them
again
for
the
soul
of
him
in
all
disputes
male
or
female
whether
for
honour
for
profit
or
for
love
it
makes
no
difference
in
the
case
nothing
is
more
dangerous
madam
than
a
wish
coming
sideways
in
this
unexpected
manner
upon
a
man
the
safest
way
in
general
to
take
off
the
force
of
the
wish
is
for
the
party
wish
at
instantly
to
get
upon
his
legs
and
wish
the
wisher
something
in
return
of
pretty
near
the
same
value
so
balancing
the
account
upon
the
spot
you
stand
as
you
were
nay
sometimes
gain
the
advantage
of
the
attack
by
it
this
will
be
fully
illustrated
to
the
world
in
my
chapter
of
slop
did
not
understand
the
nature
of
this
defence
he
was
puzzled
with
it
and
it
put
an
entire
stop
to
the
dispute
for
four
minutes
and
a
half
five
had
been
fatal
to
it
my
father
saw
the
danger
the
dispute
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
disputes
in
the
world
the
child
of
his
prayers
and
endeavours
should
be
born
without
a
head
or
with
one
he
waited
to
the
last
moment
to
allow
slop
in
whose
behalf
the
wish
was
made
his
right
of
returning
it
but
perceiving
i
say
that
he
was
confounded
and
continued
looking
with
that
perplexed
vacuity
of
eye
which
puzzled
souls
generally
stare
with
first
in
my
uncle
toby
face
then
in
his
then
up
then
down
then
east
east
and
by
east
and
so
on
coasting
it
along
by
the
plinth
of
the
wainscot
till
he
had
got
to
the
opposite
point
of
the
compass
and
that
he
had
actually
begun
to
count
the
brass
nails
upon
the
arm
of
his
chair
my
father
thought
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
with
my
uncle
toby
so
took
up
the
discourse
as
follows
chapter
what
prodigious
armies
you
had
in
flanders
brother
toby
replied
my
father
taking
his
wig
from
off
his
head
with
his
right
hand
and
with
his
left
pulling
out
a
striped
india
handkerchief
from
his
right
coat
pocket
in
order
to
rub
his
head
as
he
argued
the
point
with
my
uncle
now
in
this
i
think
my
father
was
much
to
blame
and
i
will
give
you
my
reasons
for
it
matters
of
no
more
seeming
consequence
in
themselves
than
my
father
should
have
taken
off
his
wig
with
his
right
hand
or
with
his
left
have
divided
the
greatest
kingdoms
and
made
the
crowns
of
the
monarchs
who
governed
them
to
totter
upon
their
but
need
i
tell
you
sir
that
the
circumstances
with
which
every
thing
in
this
world
is
begirt
give
every
thing
in
this
world
its
size
and
shape
and
by
tightening
it
or
relaxing
it
this
way
or
that
make
the
thing
to
be
what
it
is
great
little
good
bad
indifferent
or
not
indifferent
just
as
the
case
happens
as
my
father
india
handkerchief
was
in
his
right
coat
pocket
he
should
by
no
means
have
suffered
his
right
hand
to
have
got
engaged
on
the
contrary
instead
of
taking
off
his
wig
with
it
as
he
did
he
ought
to
have
committed
that
entirely
to
the
left
and
then
when
the
natural
exigency
my
father
was
under
of
rubbing
his
head
called
out
for
his
handkerchief
he
would
have
had
nothing
in
the
world
to
have
done
but
to
have
put
his
right
hand
into
his
right
coat
pocket
and
taken
it
out
which
he
might
have
done
without
any
violence
or
the
least
ungraceful
twist
in
any
one
tendon
or
muscle
of
his
whole
body
in
this
case
unless
indeed
my
father
had
been
resolved
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
by
holding
the
wig
stiff
in
his
left
hand
or
by
making
some
nonsensical
angle
or
other
at
his
or
armpit
his
whole
attitude
had
been
easy
natural
unforced
reynolds
himself
as
great
and
gracefully
as
he
paints
might
have
painted
him
as
he
sat
now
as
my
father
managed
this
matter
consider
what
a
devil
of
a
figure
my
father
made
of
himself
in
the
latter
end
of
queen
anne
reign
and
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
king
george
the
first
pockets
were
cut
very
low
down
in
the
skirt
i
need
say
no
more
the
father
of
mischief
had
he
been
hammering
at
it
a
month
could
not
have
contrived
a
worse
fashion
for
one
in
my
father
situation
chapter
it
was
not
an
easy
matter
in
any
king
reign
unless
you
were
as
lean
a
subject
as
myself
to
have
forced
your
hand
diagonally
quite
across
your
whole
body
so
as
to
gain
the
bottom
of
your
opposite
coat
in
the
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
eighteen
when
this
happened
it
was
extremely
difficult
so
that
when
my
uncle
toby
discovered
the
transverse
of
my
father
approaches
towards
it
it
instantly
brought
into
his
mind
those
he
had
done
duty
in
before
the
gate
of
nicolas
the
idea
of
which
drew
off
his
attention
so
intirely
from
the
subject
in
debate
that
he
had
got
his
right
hand
to
the
bell
to
ring
up
trim
to
go
and
fetch
his
map
of
namur
and
his
compasses
and
sector
along
with
it
to
measure
the
returning
angles
of
the
traverses
of
that
attack
but
particularly
of
that
one
where
he
received
his
wound
upon
his
groin
my
father
knit
his
brows
and
as
he
knit
them
all
the
blood
in
his
body
seemed
to
rush
up
into
his
face
my
uncle
toby
dismounted
immediately
i
did
not
apprehend
your
uncle
toby
was
chapter
a
man
body
and
his
mind
with
the
utmost
reverence
to
both
i
speak
it
are
exactly
like
a
jerkin
and
a
jerkin
lining
rumple
the
one
you
rumple
the
other
there
is
one
certain
exception
however
in
this
case
and
that
is
when
you
are
so
fortunate
a
fellow
as
to
have
had
your
jerkin
made
of
and
the
to
it
of
a
sarcenet
or
thin
persian
zeno
cleanthes
diogenes
babylonius
dionysius

amongst

alexandrinus
and
montaigne
amongst
the

and
a
score
and
a
half
of
good
honest
unthinking
shandean
people
as
ever
lived
whose
names
i
recollect
all
pretended
that
their
jerkins
were
made
after
this
fashion
you
might
have
rumpled
and
crumpled
and
doubled
and
creased
and
fretted
and
fridged
the
outside
of
them
all
to
pieces
in
short
you
might
have
played
the
very
devil
with
them
and
at
the
same
time
not
one
of
the
insides
of
them
would
have
been
one
button
the
worse
for
all
you
had
done
to
them
i
believe
in
my
conscience
that
mine
is
made
up
somewhat
after
this
sort
for
never
poor
jerkin
has
been
tickled
off
at
such
a
rate
as
it
has
been
these
last
nine
months
together
and
yet
i
declare
the
lining
to
it
as
far
as
i
am
a
judge
of
the
matter
is
not
a
piece
the
worse
cut
and
thrust
back
stroke
and
fore
stroke
side
way
and
have
they
been
trimming
it
for
me
had
there
been
the
least
gumminess
in
my
lining
by
heaven
it
had
all
of
it
long
ago
been
frayed
and
fretted
to
a
thread
you
the
monthly
reviewers
how
could
you
cut
and
slash
my
jerkin
as
you
did
how
did
you
know
but
you
would
cut
my
lining
too
heartily
and
from
my
soul
to
the
protection
of
that
being
who
will
injure
none
of
us
do
i
recommend
you
and
your
affairs
so
god
bless
you
only
next
month
if
any
one
of
you
should
gnash
his
teeth
and
storm
and
rage
at
me
as
some
of
you
did
last
may
in
which
i
remember
the
weather
was
very
hot
do
be
exasperated
if
i
pass
it
by
again
with
good
temper
being
determined
as
long
as
i
live
or
write
which
in
my
case
means
the
same
thing
never
to
give
the
honest
gentleman
a
worse
word
or
a
worse
wish
than
my
uncle
toby
gave
the
fly
which
buzz
about
his
nose
all
go
poor
devil
quoth
he
thee
gone
why
should
i
hurt
thee
this
world
is
surely
wide
enough
to
hold
both
thee
and
me
chapter
any
man
madam
reasoning
upwards
and
observing
the
prodigious
suffusion
of
blood
in
my
father
countenance
by
means
of
which
as
all
the
blood
in
his
body
seemed
to
rush
into
his
face
as
i
told
you
he
must
have
reddened
pictorically
and
scientifically
speaking
six
whole
tints
and
a
half
if
not
a
full
octave
above
his
natural
colour
any
man
madam
but
my
uncle
toby
who
had
observed
this
together
with
the
violent
knitting
of
my
father
brows
and
the
extravagant
contortion
of
his
body
during
the
whole
affair
would
have
concluded
my
father
in
a
rage
and
taking
that
for
granted
had
he
been
a
lover
of
such
kind
of
concord
as
arises
from
two
such
instruments
being
put
in
exact
tune
he
would
instantly
have
skrew
up
his
to
the
same
pitch
and

my

the

whose
heart
interpreted
every
motion
of
the
body
in
the
kindest
sense
the
motion
would
admit
of
would
have
concluded
my
father
angry
and
blamed
him
too
my
uncle
toby
blamed
nothing
but
the
taylor
who
cut
the
so
sitting
still
till
my
father
had
got
his
handkerchief
out
of
it
and
looking
all
the
time
up
in
his
face
with
inexpressible
my
father
at
length
went
on
as
follows
chapter
prodigious
armies
you
had
in
flanders
brother
toby
quoth
my
father
i
do
believe
thee
to
be
as
honest
a
man
and
with
as
good
and
as
upright
a
heart
as
ever
god
created
nor
is
it
thy
fault
if
all
the
children
which
have
been
may
can
shall
will
or
ought
to
be
begotten
come
with
their
heads
foremost
into
the
world
but
believe
me
dear
toby
the
accidents
which
unavoidably
them
not
only
in
the
article
of
our
begetting
though
these
in
my
opinion
are
well
worth
considering
but
the
dangers
and
difficulties
our
children
are
beset
with
after
they
are
got
forth
into
the
world
are
enow
little
need
is
there
to
expose
them
to
unnecessary
ones
in
their
passage
to
are
these
dangers
quoth
my
uncle
toby
laying
his
hand
upon
my
father
knee
and
looking
up
seriously
in
his
face
for
an
answer
are
these
dangers
greater
now
brother
than
in
times
past
brother
toby
answered
my
father
if
a
child
was
but
fairly
begot
and
born
alive
and
healthy
and
the
mother
did
well
after
it
our
forefathers
never
looked
my
uncle
toby
instantly
withdrew
his
hand
from
off
my
father
knee
reclined
his
body
gently
back
in
his
chair
raised
his
head
till
he
could
just
see
the
cornice
of
the
room
and
then
directing
the
buccinatory
muscles
along
his
cheeks
and
the
orbicular
muscles
around
his
lips
to
do
their
duty
he
whistled
lillabullero
chapter
whilst
my
uncle
toby
was
whistling
lillabullero
to
my
father
slop
was
stamping
and
cursing
and
damning
at
obadiah
at
a
most
dreadful
rate
it
would
have
done
your
heart
good
and
cured
you
sir
for
ever
of
the
vile
sin
of
swearing
to
have
heard
him
i
am
determined
therefore
to
relate
the
whole
affair
to
you
when
slop
maid
delivered
the
green
baize
bag
with
her
instruments
in
it
to
obadiah
she
very
sensibly
exhorted
him
to
put
his
head
and
one
arm
through
the
strings
and
ride
with
it
slung
across
his
body
so
undoing
the
to
lengthen
the
strings
for
him
without
any
more
ado
she
helped
him
on
with
it
however
as
this
in
some
measure
unguarded
the
mouth
of
the
bag
lest
any
thing
should
bolt
out
in
galloping
back
at
the
speed
obadiah
threatened
they
consulted
to
take
it
off
again
and
in
the
great
care
and
caution
of
their
hearts
they
had
taken
the
two
strings
and
tied
them
close
pursing
up
the
mouth
of
the
bag
first
with
half
a
dozen
hard
knots
each
of
which
obadiah
to
make
all
safe
had
twitched
and
drawn
together
with
all
the
strength
of
his
body
this
answered
all
that
obadiah
and
the
maid
intended
but
was
no
remedy
against
some
evils
which
neither
he
or
she
foresaw
the
instruments
it
seems
as
tight
as
the
bag
was
tied
above
had
so
much
room
to
play
in
it
towards
the
bottom
the
shape
of
the
bag
being
conical
that
obadiah
could
not
make
a
trot
of
it
but
with
such
a
terrible
jingle
what
with
the
tire
tete
forceps
and
squirt
as
would
have
been
enough
had
hymen
been
taking
a
jaunt
that
way
to
have
frightened
him
out
of
the
country
but
when
obadiah
accelerated
his
motion
and
from
a
plain
trot
assayed
to
prick
his
into
a
full
gallop
by
heaven
sir
the
jingle
was
incredible
as
obadiah
had
a
wife
and
three
children
the
turpitude
of
fornication
and
the
many
other
political
ill
consequences
of
this
jingling
never
once
entered
his
brain
he
had
however
his
objection
which
came
home
to
himself
and
weighed
with
him
as
it
has
done
with
the
greatest
poor
fellow
sir
was
not
able
to
hear
himself
whistle
chapter
as
obadiah
loved
preferably
to
all
the
instrumental
music
he
carried
with
him
he
very
considerately
set
his
imagination
to
work
to
contrive
and
to
invent
by
what
means
he
should
put
himself
in
a
condition
of
enjoying
it
in
all
distresses
except
musical
where
small
cords
are
wanted
nothing
is
so
apt
to
enter
a
man
head
as
his
the
philosophy
of
this
is
so
near
the
surface
i
scorn
to
enter
into
it
as
obadiah
was
a
mixed
case
mark
sirs
i
say
a
mixed
case
for
it
was
obstetrical
squirtical
papistical
and
as
far
as
the
was
concerned
in
it
caballistical
and
only
partly
musical
obadiah
made
no
scruple
of
availing
himself
of
the
first
expedient
which
offered
so
taking
hold
of
the
bag
and
instruments
and
griping
them
hard
together
with
one
hand
and
with
the
finger
and
thumb
of
the
other
putting
the
end
of
the
betwixt
his
teeth
and
then
slipping
his
hand
down
to
the
middle
of
it
he
tied
and
them
all
fast
together
from
one
end
to
the
other
as
you
would
cord
a
trunk
with
such
a
multiplicity
of
and
intricate
cross
turns
with
a
hard
knot
at
every
intersection
or
point
where
the
strings
met
that
slop
must
have
had
three
fifths
of
job
patience
at
least
to
have
unloosed
i
think
in
my
conscience
that
had
nature
been
in
one
of
her
nimble
moods
and
in
humour
for
such
a
contest
and
she
and
slop
both
fairly
started
together
there
is
no
man
living
which
had
seen
the
bag
with
all
that
obadiah
had
done
to
it
and
known
likewise
the
great
speed
the
goddess
can
make
when
she
thinks
proper
who
would
have
had
the
least
doubt
remaining
in
his
mind
which
of
the
two
would
have
carried
off
the
prize

great

for
the
moment
slop
cast
his
eyes
upon
his
bag
which
he
had
not
done
till
the
dispute
with
my
uncle
toby
about
put
him
in
mind
of
it
the
very
same
thought
is
god
mercy
quoth
he
to
himself
that
shandy
has
had
so
bad
a
time
of
it
else
she
might
have
been
brought
to
bed
seven
times
told
before
one
half
of
these
knots
could
have
got
but
here
you
must
distinguish
the
thought
floated
only
in
slop
mind
without
sail
or
ballast
to
it
as
a
simple
proposition
millions
of
which
as
your
worship
knows
are
every
day
swimming
quietly
in
the
middle
of
the
thin
juice
of
a
man
understanding
without
being
carried
backwards
or
forwards
till
some
little
gusts
of
passion
or
interest
drive
them
to
one
side
a
sudden
trampling
in
the
room
above
near
my
mother
bed
did
the
proposition
the
very
service
i
am
speaking
of
by
all
unfortunate
quoth
slop
unless
i
make
haste
the
thing
will
actually
befall
me
as
it
is
chapter
in
the
case
of
knots
by
which
in
the
first
place
i
would
not
be
understood
to
mean
because
in
the
course
of
my
life
and
opinions
my
opinions
concerning
them
will
come
in
more
properly
when
i
mention
the
catastrophe
of
my
great
uncle
hammond
shandy
a
little
man
but
of
high
fancy
he
rushed
into
the
duke
of
affair
nor
secondly
in
this
place
do
i
mean
that
particular
species
of
knots
called
there
is
so
little
address
or
skill
or
patience
required
in
the
unloosing
them
that
they
are
below
my
giving
any
opinion
at
all
about
but
by
the
knots
i
am
speaking
of
may
it
please
your
reverences
to
believe
that
i
mean
good
honest
devilish
tight
hard
knots
made
bona
fide
as
obadiah
made
his
in
which
there
is
no
quibbling
provision
made
by
the
duplication
and
return
of
the
two
ends
of
the
strings
thro
the
annulus
or
noose
made
by
the
second
implication
of
them
to
get
them
slipp
and
undone
i
hope
you
apprehend
me
in
the
case
of
these
knots
then
and
of
the
several
obstructions
which
may
it
please
your
reverences
such
knots
cast
in
our
way
in
getting
through
life
every
hasty
man
can
whip
out
his
and
cut
through
is
wrong
believe
me
sirs
the
most
virtuous
way
and
which
both
reason
and
conscience
dictate
is
to
take
our
teeth
or
our
fingers
to
dr
slop
had
lost
his
teeth
his
favourite
instrument
by
extracting
in
a
wrong
direction
or
by
some
misapplication
of
it
unfortunately
slipping
he
had
formerly
in
a
hard
labour
out
three
of
the
best
of
them
with
the
handle
of
it
he
tried
his
fingers
alas
the
nails
of
his
fingers
and
thumbs
were
cut
the
duce
take
it
i
can
make
nothing
of
it
either
way
cried
dr
the
trampling
over

near
my
mother
pox
take
the
fellow
i
shall
never
get
the
knots
untied
as
long
as
i
my
mother
gave
a
lend
me
your
penknife
i
must
cut
the
knots
at
last
pugh
psha
lord
i
have
cut
my
thumb
quite
across
to
the
very
bone
curse
the
fellow
if
there
was
not
another
within
fifty
miles
i
am
undone
for
this
bout
i
wish
the
scoundrel
hang
i
wish
he
was
shot
i
wish
all
the
devils
in
hell
had
him
for
a
blockhead
my
father
had
a
great
respect
for
obadiah
and
could
not
bear
to
hear
him
disposed
of
in
such
a
manner
he
had
moreover
some
little
respect
for
himself
and
could
as
ill
bear
with
the
indignity
offered
to
himself
in
it
had
slop
cut
any
part
about
him
but
his
thumb
my
father
had
it
by
his
prudence
had
triumphed
as
it
was
he
was
determined
to
have
his
revenge
small
curses
slop
upon
great
occasions
quoth
my
father
condoling
with
him
first
upon
the
accident
are
but
so
much
waste
of
our
strength
and
soul
health
to
no
manner
of
i
own
it
replied
dr
they
are
like
quoth
my
uncle
toby
suspending
his
whistling
fired
against
a
they
serve
continued
my
father
to
stir
the
humours
but
carry
off
none
of
their
acrimony
for
my
own
part
i
seldom
swear
or
curse
at
all
i
hold
it
bad
but
if
i
fall
into
it
by
surprize
i
generally
retain
so
much
presence
of
mind
right
quoth
my
uncle
toby
as
to
make
it
answer
my
purpose
that
is
i
swear
on
till
i
find
myself
easy
a
wife
and
a
just
man
however
would
always
endeavour
to
proportion
the
vent
given
to
these
humours
not
only
to
the
degree
of
them
stirring
within
himself
but
to
the
size
and
ill
intent
of
the
offence
upon
which
they
are
to
come
only
from
the
heart
quoth
my
uncle
toby
for
this
reason
continued
my
father
with
the
most
cervantick
gravity
i
have
the
greatest
veneration
in
the
world
for
that
gentleman
who
in
distrust
of
his
own
discretion
in
this
point
sat
down
and
composed
that
is
at
his
leisure
fit
forms
of
swearing
suitable
to
all
cases
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
provocation
which
could
possibly
happen
to
him
which
forms
being
well
considered
by
him
and
such
moreover
as
he
could
stand
to
he
kept
them
ever
by
him
on
the
within
his
reach
ready
for
i
never
apprehended
replied
slop
that
such
a
thing
was
ever
thought
of
much
less
executed
i
beg
your
pardon
answered
my
father
i
was
reading
though
not
using
one
of
them
to
my
brother
toby
this
morning
whilst
he
pour
out
the
tea
is
here
upon
the
shelf
over
my
head
but
if
i
remember
right
is
too
violent
for
a
cut
of
the
not
at
all
quoth
slop
the
devil
take
the
then
answered
my
father
is
much
at
your
service
slop
on
condition
you
will
read
it
aloud
so
rising
up
and
reaching
down
a
form
of
excommunication
of
the
church
of
rome
a
copy
of
which
my
father
who
was
curious
in
his
collections
had
procured
out
of
the
of
the
church
of
rochester
writ
by
ernulphus
the
bishop
with
a
most
affected
seriousness
of
look
and
voice
which
might
have
cajoled
ernulphus
himself
he
put
it
into
slop
dr
slop
wrapt
his
thumb
up
in
the
corner
of
his
handkerchief
and
with
a
wry
face
though
without
any
suspicion
read
aloud
as
follows
my
uncle
toby
whistling
lillabullero
as
loud
as
he
could
all
the
time
as
the
geniuneness
of
the
consultation
of
the
sorbonne
upon
the
question
of
baptism
was
doubted
by
some
and
denied
by
others
was
thought

the

and

and
of

holy
canons
and
of
the
undefiled
virgin

and

of

i
think
there
is
no
necessity
quoth
slop
dropping
the
paper
down
to
his
knee
and
addressing
himself
to
my
father
as
you
have
read
it
over
sir
so
lately
to
read
it
aloud
and
as
captain
shandy
seems
to
have
no
great
inclination
to
hear
it
i
may
as
well
read
it
to
myself
that
contrary
to
treaty
replied
my
father
besides
there
is
something
so
whimsical
especially
in
the
latter
part
of
it
i
should
grieve
to
lose
the
pleasure
of
a
second
reading
slop
did
not
altogether
like
it
but
my
uncle
toby
offering
at
that
instant
to
give
over
whistling
and
read
it
himself
to
them
slop
thought
he
might
as
well
read
it
under
the
cover
of
my
uncle
toby
whistling
as
suffer
my
uncle
toby
to
read
it
alone
so
raising
up
the
paper
to
his
face
and
holding
it
quite
parallel
to
it
in
order
to
hide
his
chagrin
he
read
it
aloud
as
follows
my
uncle
toby
whistling
lillabullero
though
not
quite
so
loud
as
before
the
authority
of
god
almighty
the
father
son
and
holy
ghost
and
of
the

of
all
the
celestial
virtues
angels

cherubins
and
seraphins
and
of
all
the
holy
patriarchs

and
of
all
the
apostles
and
evangelists
and
of
the
holy
innocents
who
in
the
sight
of
the
holy
lamb
are
found
worthy
to
sing
the
new
song
of
the

and
of
the

and
of
all
the

together
with

may
he
obadiah
damn
for

excommunicate
and
anathematize
him
and
from
the
thresholds
of

we
sequester
him
that

may
be
tormented
disposed

those
who

unto
the

taking
the
advantage

bar
of
his
tune
kept
whistling
one
continued
note
to
the
end
of
the
dr

division
of

my

shook
his

in

he
be
cursed
in
all
the
joints

from
the
top
of
his

to
the

there
be

with
all

here
my
uncle
toby
throwing
back
his

gave
a
monstrous
long
loud
whew
w
w
something
betwixt
the
interjectional
whistle
of
and
the
word
itself
by
the
golden
beard
of
jupiter
and
of
juno
if
her
majesty
wore
one
and
by
the
beards
of
the
rest
of
your
heathen
worships
which
by
the
bye
was
no
small
number
since
what
with
the
beards
of
your
celestial
gods
and
gods
aerial
and
aquatick
to
say
nothing
of
the
beards
of

or
of
the
celestial
goddesses
your
wives
or
of
the
infernal
goddesses
your
whores
and
concubines
that
is
in
case
they
wore
them
all
which
beards
as
varro
tells
me
upon
his
word
and
honour
when
mustered
up
together
made
no
less
than
thirty
thousand
effective
beards
upon
the
pagan
establishment
every
beard
of
which
claimed
the
rights
and
privileges
of
being
stroken
and
sworn
by
by
all
these
beards
together
then
i
vow
and
protest
that
of
the
two
bad
cassocks
i
am
worth
in
the
world
i
would
have
given
the
better
of
them
as
freely
as
ever
cid
hamet
offered
his
to
have
stood
by
and
heard
my
uncle
accompanyment

continued

all
the
powers
which
move
therein
rise
up

repent
and
make
satisfaction
amen
so
be
it
so
be
it
amen
i
declare
quoth
my
uncle
toby
my
heart
would
not
let
me
curse
the
devil
himself
with
so
much
he
is
the
father
of
curses
replied
dr
so
am
not
i
replied
my
but
he
is
cursed
and
damn
already
to
all
eternity
replied
slop
i
am
sorry
for
it
quoth
my
uncle
toby
slop
drew
up
his
mouth
and
was
just
beginning
to
return
my
uncle
toby
the
compliment
of
his
whu
u
u
or
interjectional
whistle
when
the
door
hastily
opening
in
the
next
chapter
but
one
put
an
end
to
the
affair
chapter
now
do
let
us
give
ourselves
a
parcel
of
airs
and
pretend
that
the
oaths
we
make
free
with
in
this
land
of
liberty
of
ours
are
our
own
and
because
we
have
the
spirit
to
swear
them
imagine
that
we
have
had
the
wit
to
invent
them
too
i
undertake
this
moment
to
prove
it
to
any
man
in
the
world
except
to
a
connoisseur
though
i
declare
i
object
only
to
a
connoisseur
in
swearing
as
i
would
do
to
a
connoisseur
in
painting
the
whole
set
of
are
so
hung
round
and
befetish
with
the
bobs
and
trinkets
of
criticism
or
to
drop
my
metaphor
which
by
the
bye
is
a
pity
for
i
have
fetch
it
as
far
as
from
the
coast
of
guiney
their
heads
sir
are
stuck
so
full
of
rules
and
compasses
and
have
that
eternal
propensity
to
apply
them
upon
all
occasions
that
a
work
of
genius
had
better
go
to
the
devil
at
once
than
stand
to
be
prick
and
tortured
to
death
by
and
how
did
garrick
speak
the
soliloquy
last
night
oh
against
all
rule
my
lord
most
ungrammatically
betwixt
the
substantive
and
the
adjective
which
should
agree
together
in
number
case
and
gender
he
made
a
breach
thus
stopping
as
if
the
point
wanted
settling
and
betwixt
the
nominative
case
which
your
lordship
knows
should
govern
the
verb
he
suspended
his
voice
in
the
epilogue
a
dozen
times
three
seconds
and
three
fifths
by
a
stop
watch
my
lord
each
admirable
grammarian
but
in
suspending
his
voice
was
the
sense
suspended
likewise
did
no
expression
of
attitude
or
countenance
fill
up
the
chasm
was
the
eye
silent
did
you
narrowly
look
i
look
only
at
the
my
excellent
observer
and
what
of
this
new
book
the
whole
world
makes
such
a
rout
about
oh
is
out
of
all
plumb
my
lord
quite
an
irregular
thing
not
one
of
the
angles
at
the
four
corners
was
a
right
i
had
my
rule
and
compasses
my
lord
in
my
excellent
critick
and
for
the
epick
poem
your
lordship
bid
me
look
at
upon
taking
the
length
breadth
height
and
depth
of
it
and
trying
them
at
home
upon
an
exact
scale
of
bossu
is
out
my
lord
in
every
one
of
its
admirable
connoisseur
and
did
you
step
in
to
take
a
look
at
the
grand
picture
in
your
way
back
is
a
melancholy
daub
my
lord
not
one
principle
of
the
pyramid
in
any
one
group
and
what
a
price
for
there
is
nothing
of
the
colouring
of
titian
the
expression
of
rubens
the
grace
of
raphael
the
purity
of
dominichino
the
corregiescity
of
corregio
the
learning
of
poussin
the
airs
of
guido
the
taste
of
the
carrachis
or
the
grand
contour
of
grant
me
patience
just
heaven
of
all
the
cants
which
are
canted
in
this
canting
world
though
the
cant
of
hypocrites
may
be
the
worst
the
cant
of
criticism
is
the
most
tormenting
i
would
go
fifty
miles
on
foot
for
i
have
not
a
horse
worth
riding
on
to
kiss
the
hand
of
that
man
whose
generous
heart
will
give
up
the
reins
of
his
imagination
into
his
author
hands
be
pleased
he
knows
not
why
and
cares
not
wherefore
great
apollo
if
thou
art
in
a
giving
humour
give
me
i
ask
no
more
but
one
stroke
of
native
humour
with
a
single
spark
of
thy
own
fire
along
with
it
and
send
mercury
with
the
rules
and
compasses
if
he
can
be
spared
with
my
compliments
to
no
matter
now
to
any
one
else
i
will
undertake
to
prove
that
all
the
oaths
and
imprecations
which
we
have
been
puffing
off
upon
the
world
for
these
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
last
past
as
originals
except
thumb
god
flesh
and
god
fish
which
were
oaths
monarchical
and
considering
who
made
them
not
much
amiss
and
as
kings
oaths
is
not
much
matter
whether
they
were
fish
or
flesh
else
i
say
there
is
not
an
oath
or
at
least
a
curse
amongst
them
which
has
not
been
copied
over
and
over
again
out
of
ernulphus
a
thousand
times
but
like
all
other
copies
how
infinitely
short
of
the
force
and
spirit
of
the
original
it
is
thought
to
be
no
bad
oath
and
by
itself
passes
very
well
damn
you
set
it
beside
ernulphus
almighty
the
father
damn
you
god
the
son
damn
you
god
the
holy
ghost
damn
you
you
see
is
there
is
an
orientality
in
his
we
can
not
rise
up
to
besides
he
is
more
copious
in
his
invention
possess
more
of
the
excellencies
of
a
swearer
had
such
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
human
frame
its
membranes
nerves
ligaments
knittings
of
the
joints
and
articulations
that
when
ernulphus
cursed
no
part
escaped
is
true
there
is
something
of
a
hardness
in
his
manner
and
as
in
michael
angelo
a
want
of
grace
but
then
there
is
such
a
greatness
of
gusto
my
father
who
generally
look
upon
every
thing
in
a
light
very
different
from
all
mankind
would
after
all
never
allow
this
to
be
an
he
considered
rather
ernulphus
anathema
as
an
institute
of
swearing
in
which
as
he
suspected
upon
the
decline
of
swearing
in
some
milder
pontificate
ernulphus
by
order
of
the
succeeding
pope
had
with
great
learning
and
diligence
collected
together
all
the
laws
of
it
for
the
same
reason
that
justinian
in
the
decline
of
the
empire
had
ordered
his
chancellor
tribonian
to
collect
the
roman
or
civil
laws
all
together
into
one
code
or
digest
lest
through
the
rust
of
time
and
the
fatality
of
all
things
committed
to
oral
tradition
they
should
be
lost
to
the
world
for
ever
for
this
reason
my
father
would
affirm
there
was
not
an
oath
from
the
great
and
tremendous
oath
of
william
the
conqueror
by
the
splendour
of
god
down
to
the
lowest
oath
of
a
scavenger
damn
your
eyes
which
was
not
to
be
found
in
in
short
he
would
add
i
defy
a
man
to
swear
out
of
it
the
hypothesis
is
like
most
of
my
father
singular
and
ingenious
too
nor
have
i
any
objection
to
it
but
that
it
overturns
my
own
chapter
bless
my
soul
my
poor
mistress
is
ready
to
faint
and
her
pains
are
gone
and
the
drops
are
done
and
the
bottle
of
julap
is
broke
and
the
nurse
has
cut
her
arm
and
i
my
thumb
cried
slop
and
the
child
is
where
it
was
continued
susannah
and
the
midwife
has
fallen
backwards
upon
the
edge
of
the
fender
and
bruised
her
hip
as
black
as
your
i
look
at
it
quoth
dr
there
is
no
need
of
that
replied
susannah
you
had
better
look
at
my
mistress
but
the
midwife
would
gladly
first
give
you
an
account
how
things
are
so
desires
you
would
go
up
stairs
and
speak
to
her
this
moment
human
nature
is
the
same
in
all
professions
the
midwife
had
just
before
been
put
over
slop
head
he
had
not
digested
no
replied
slop
be
full
as
proper
if
the
midwife
came
down
to
i
like
subordination
quoth
my
uncle
toby
and
but
for
it
after
the
reduction
of
lisle
i
know
not
what
might
have
become
of
the
garrison
of
ghent
in
the
mutiny
for
bread
in
the
year
nor
replied
slop
parodying
my
uncle
reflection
though
full
as
himself
do
i
know
captain
shandy
what
might
have
become
of
the
garrison
above
stairs
in
the
mutiny
and
confusion
i
find
all
things
are
in
at
present
but
for
the
subordination
of
fingers
and
thumbs
to
the
application
of
which
sir
under
this
accident
of
mine
comes
in
so
a
propos
that
without
it
the
cut
upon
my
thumb
might
have
been
felt
by
the
shandy
family
as
long
as
the
shandy
family
had
a
name
chapter
let
us
go
back
to
the
in
the
last
chapter
it
is
a
singular
stroke
of
eloquence
at
least
it
was
so
when
eloquence
flourished
at
athens
and
rome
and
would
be
so
now
did
orators
wear
mantles
not
to
mention
the
name
of
a
thing
when
you
had
the
thing
about
you
in
petto
ready
to
produce
pop
in
the
place
you
want
it
a
scar
an
axe
a
sword
a
pink
doublet
a
rusty
helmet
a
pound
and
a
half
of
in
an
urn
or
a
pickle
pot
but
above
all
a
tender
infant
royally
tho
if
it
was
too
young
and
the
oration
as
long
as
tully
second
philippick
it
must
certainly
have
beshit
the
orator
and
then
again
if
too
old
it
must
have
been
unwieldly
and
incommodious
to
his
action
so
as
to
make
him
lose
by
his
child
almost
as
much
as
he
could
gain
by
otherwise
when
a
state
orator
has
hit
the
precise
age
to
a
minute
hid
his
bambino
in
his
mantle
so
cunningly
that
no
mortal
could
smell
it
and
produced
it
so
critically
that
no
soul
could
say
it
came
in
by
head
and
shoulders
oh
sirs
it
has
done
wonders
it
has
open
the
sluices
and
turn
the
brains
and
shook
the
principles
and
unhinged
the
politicks
of
half
a
nation
these
feats
however
are
not
to
be
done
except
in
those
states
and
times
i
say
where
orators
wore
mantles
and
pretty
large
ones
too
my
brethren
with
some
twenty
or
yards
of
good
purple
superfine
marketable
cloth
in
them
with
large
flowing
folds
and
doubles
and
in
a
great
style
of
all
which
plainly
shews
may
it
please
your
worships
that
the
decay
of
eloquence
and
the
little
good
service
it
does
at
present
both
within
and
without
doors
is
owing
to
nothing
else
in
the
world
but
short
coats
and
the
disuse
of
we
can
conceal
nothing
under
ours
madam
worth
shewing
chapter
slop
was
within
an
ace
of
being
an
exception
to
all
this
argumentation
for
happening
to
have
his
green
baize
bag
upon
his
knees
when
he
began
to
parody
my
uncle
toby
was
as
good
as
the
best
mantle
in
the
world
to
him
for
which
purpose
when
he
foresaw
the
sentence
would
end
in
his
forceps
he
thrust
his
hand
into
the
bag
in
order
to
have
them
ready
to
clap
in
when
your
reverences
took
so
much
notice
of
the
which
had
he
managed
my
uncle
toby
had
certainly
been
overthrown
the
sentence
and
the
argument
in
that
case
jumping
closely
in
one
point
so
like
the
two
lines
which
form
the
salient
angle
of
a
ravelin
slop
would
never
have
given
them
up
and
my
uncle
toby
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
flying
as
taking
them
by
force
but
slop
fumbled
so
vilely
in
pulling
them
out
it
took
off
the
whole
effect
and
what
was
a
ten
times
worse
evil
for
they
seldom
come
alone
in
this
life
in
pulling
out
his
forceps
his
forceps
unfortunately
drew
out
the
squirt
along
with
it
when
a
proposition
can
be
taken
in
two
senses
is
a
law
in
disputation
that
the
respondent
may
reply
to
which
of
the
two
he
pleases
or
finds
most
convenient
for
this
threw
the
advantage
of
the
argument
quite
on
my
uncle
toby
god
cried
my
uncle
toby
children
brought
into
the
world
with
a
squirt
chapter
upon
my
honour
sir
you
have
tore
every
bit
of
skin
quite
off
the
back
of
both
my
hands
with
your
forceps
cried
my
uncle
toby
and
you
have
crush
all
my
knuckles
into
the
bargain
with
them
to
a
jelly
is
your
own
fault
said
slop
you
should
have
clinch
your
two
fists
together
into
the
form
of
a
child
head
as
i
told
you
and
sat
i
did
so
answered
my
uncle
then
the
points
of
my
forceps
have
not
been
sufficiently
arm
or
the
rivet
wants
closing
or
else
the
cut
on
my
thumb
has
made
me
a
little
aukward
or
possibly
is
well
quoth
my
father
interrupting
the
detail
of
possibilities
that
the
experiment
was
not
first
made
upon
my
child
it
would
not
have
been
a
the
worse
answered
dr
i
maintain
it
said
my
uncle
toby
it
would
have
broke
the
cerebellum
unless
indeed
the
skull
had
been
as
hard
as
a
granado
and
turn
it
all
into
a
perfect
pshaw
replied
slop
a
child
head
is
naturally
as
soft
as
the
pap
of
an
apple
the
sutures
give
way
and
besides
i
could
have
extracted
by
the
feet
not
you
said
i
rather
wish
you
would
begin
that
way
quoth
my
father
pray
do
added
my
uncle
toby
chapter
and
pray
good
woman
after
all
will
you
take
upon
you
to
say
it
may
not
be
the
child
hip
as
well
as
the
child
head
is
most
certainly
the
head
replied
the
midwife
because
continued
slop
turning
to
my
father
as
positive
as
these
old
ladies
generally
are
is
a
point
very
difficult
to
know
and
yet
of
the
greatest
consequence
to
be
known
because
sir
if
the
hip
is
mistaken
for
the
head
there
is
a
possibility
if
it
is
a
boy
that
the
forceps
what
the
possibility
was
slop
whispered
very
low
to
my
father
and
then
to
my
uncle
there
is
no
such
danger
continued
he
with
the
no
in
truth
quoth
my
father
but
when
your
possibility
has
taken
place
at
the
hip
you
may
as
well
take
off
the
head
too
it
is
morally
impossible
the
reader
should
understand
this
is
enough
slop
understood
it
so
taking
the
green
baize
bag
in
his
hand
with
the
help
of
obadiah
pumps
he
tripp
pretty
nimbly
for
a
man
of
his
size
across
the
room
to
the
door
and
from
the
door
was
shewn
the
way
by
the
good
old
midwife
to
my
mother
apartments
chapter
it
is
two
hours
and
ten
minutes
and
no
more
cried
my
father
looking
at
his
watch
since
slop
and
obadiah
arrived
and
i
know
not
how
it
happens
brother
toby
but
to
my
imagination
it
seems
almost
an
age
here
pray
sir
take
hold
of
my
cap
nay
take
the
bell
along
with
it
and
my
pantoufles
too
now
sir
they
are
all
at
your
service
and
i
freely
make
you
a
present
of
on
condition
you
give
me
all
your
attention
to
this
chapter
though
my
father
said
knew
not
how
it
happen
yet
he
knew
very
well
how
it
happen
and
at
the
instant
he
spoke
it
was
in
his
mind
to
give
my
uncle
toby
a
clear
account
of
the
matter
by
a
metaphysical
dissertation
upon
the
subject
of
duration
and
its
simple
modes
in
order
to
shew
my
uncle
toby
by
what
mechanism
and
mensurations
in
the
brain
it
came
to
pass
that
the
rapid
succession
of
their
ideas
and
the
eternal
scampering
of
the
discourse
from
one
thing
to
another
since
slop
had
come
into
the
room
had
lengthened
out
so
short
a
period
to
so
inconceivable
an
know
not
how
it
happens
cried
my
father
but
it
seems
an
age
is
owing
entirely
quoth
my
uncle
toby
to
the
succession
of
our
ideas
my
father
who
had
an
itch
in
common
with
all
philosophers
of
reasoning
upon
every
thing
which
happened
and
accounting
for
it
too
proposed
infinite
pleasure
to
himself
in
this
of
the
succession
of
ideas
and
had
not
the
least
apprehension
of
having
it
snatch
out
of
his
hands
by
my
uncle
toby
who
honest
man
generally
took
every
thing
as
it
happened
and
who
of
all
things
in
the
world
troubled
his
brain
the
least
with
abstruse
thinking
the
ideas
of
time
and
space
or
how
we
came
by
those
ideas
or
of
what
stuff
they
were
made
or
whether
they
were
born
with
us
or
we
picked
them
up
afterwards
as
we
went
along
or
whether
we
did
it
in
frocks
or
not
till
we
had
got
into
breeches
with
a
thousand
other
inquiries
and
disputes
about
infinity
prescience
liberty
necessity
and
so
forth
upon
whose
desperate
and
unconquerable
theories
so
many
fine
heads
have
been
turned
and
cracked
never
did
my
uncle
toby
the
least
injury
at
all
my
father
knew
it
and
was
no
less
surprized
than
he
was
disappointed
with
my
uncle
fortuitous
solution
do
you
understand
the
theory
of
that
affair
replied
my
father
not
i
quoth
my
uncle
but
you
have
some
ideas
said
my
father
of
what
you
talk
about
no
more
than
my
horse
replied
my
uncle
toby
gracious
heaven
cried
my
father
looking
upwards
and
clasping
his
two
hands
together
there
is
a
worth
in
thy
honest
ignorance
brother
toby
almost
a
pity
to
exchange
it
for
a
but
tell
to
understand
what
time
is
aright
without
which
we
never
can
comprehend
infinity
insomuch
as
one
is
a
portion
of
the
other
we
ought
seriously
to
sit
down
and
consider
what
idea
it
is
we
have
of
duration
so
as
to
give
a
satisfactory
account
how
we
came
by
what
is
that
to
any
body
quoth
my
uncle
toby
vide
locke
for
if
you
will
turn
your
eyes
inwards
upon
your
mind
continued
my
father
and
observe
attentively
you
will
perceive
brother
that
whilst
you
and
i
are
talking
together
and
thinking
and
smoking
our
pipes
or
whilst
we
receive
successively
ideas
in
our
minds
we
know
that
we
do
exist
and
so
we
estimate
the
existence
or
the
continuation
of
the
existence
of
ourselves
or
any
thing
else
commensurate
to
the
succession
of
any
ideas
in
our
minds
the
duration
of
ourselves
or
any
such
other
thing
with
our
thinking
and
so
according
to
that
preconceived
you
puzzle
me
to
death
cried
my
uncle
toby
is
owing
to
this
replied
my
father
that
in
our
computations
of
time
we
are
so
used
to
minutes
hours
weeks
and
months
and
of
clocks
i
wish
there
was
not
a
clock
in
the
kingdom
to
measure
out
their
several
portions
to
us
and
to
those
who
belong
to
us
that
be
well
if
in
time
to
come
the
succession
of
our
ideas
be
of
any
use
or
service
to
us
at
all
now
whether
we
observe
it
or
no
continued
my
father
in
every
sound
man
head
there
is
a
regular
succession
of
ideas
of
one
sort
or
other
which
follow
each
other
in
train
just
like
a
train
of
artillery
said
my
uncle
toby
a
train
of
a
quoth
my
father
which
follow
and
succeed
one
another
in
our
minds
at
certain
distances
just
like
the
images
in
the
inside
of
a
lanthorn
turned
round
by
the
heat
of
a
i
declare
quoth
my
uncle
toby
mine
are
more
like
a
then
brother
toby
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
you
upon
that
subject
said
my
father
chapter
what
a
conjuncture
was
here
lost
my
father
in
one
of
his
best
explanatory
moods
in
eager
pursuit
of
a
metaphysical
point
into
the
very
regions
where
clouds
and
thick
darkness
would
soon
have
encompassed
it
about
my
uncle
toby
in
one
of
the
finest
dispositions
for
it
in
the
world
his
head
like
a
the
funnel
unswept
and
the
ideas
whirling
round
and
round
about
in
it
all
obfuscated
and
darkened
over
with
fuliginous
matter
by
the
of
lucian
if
it
is
in
being
if
not
why
then
by
his
ashes
by
the
ashes
of
my
dear
rabelais
and
dearer
cervantes
my
father
and
my
uncle
toby
discourse
upon
time
and
eternity
was
a
discourse
devoutly
to
be
wished
for
and
the
petulancy
of
my
father
humour
in
putting
a
stop
to
it
as
he
did
was
a
robbery
of
the
ontologic
treasury
of
such
a
jewel
as
no
coalition
of
great
occasions
and
great
men
are
ever
likely
to
restore
to
it
again
chapter
tho
my
father
persisted
in
not
going
on
with
the
discourse
yet
he
could
not
get
my
uncle
toby
out
of
his
head
piqued
as
he
was
at
first
with
it
there
was
something
in
the
comparison
at
the
bottom
which
hit
his
fancy
for
which
purpose
resting
his
elbow
upon
the
table
and
reclining
the
right
side
of
his
head
upon
the
palm
of
his
hand
but
looking
first
stedfastly
in
the
fire
he
began
to
commune
with
himself
and
philosophize
about
it
but
his
spirits
being
wore
out
with
the
fatigues
of
investigating
new
tracts
and
the
constant
exertion
of
his
faculties
upon
that
variety
of
subjects
which
had
taken
their
turn
in
the
discourse
the
idea
of
the
smoke
jack
soon
turned
all
his
ideas
upside
down
so
that
he
fell
asleep
almost
before
he
knew
what
he
was
about
as
for
my
uncle
toby
his
had
not
made
a
dozen
revolutions
before
he
fell
asleep
peace
be
with
them
both
dr
slop
is
engaged
with
the
midwife
and
my
mother
above
trim
is
busy
in
turning
an
old
pair
of
into
a
couple
of
mortars
to
be
employed
in
the
siege
of
messina
next
summer
and
is
this
instant
boring
the
with
the
point
of
a
hot
all
my
heroes
are
off
my
hands
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
a
moment
to
spare
and
i
make
use
of
it
and
write
my
preface
the
author
preface
no
i
not
say
a
word
about
it
here
it
is
in
publishing
it
i
have
appealed
to
the
world
and
to
the
world
i
leave
it
it
must
speak
for
itself
all
i
know
of
the
matter
is
when
i
sat
down
my
intent
was
to
write
a
good
book
and
as
far
as
the
tenuity
of
my
understanding
would
hold
out
a
wise
aye
and
a
discreet
taking
care
only
as
i
went
along
to
put
into
it
all
the
wit
and
the
judgment
be
it
more
or
less
which
the
great
author
and
bestower
of
them
had
thought
fit
originally
to
give
me
so
that
as
your
worships
see
is
just
as
god
pleases
now
agalastes
speaking
dispraisingly
sayeth
that
there
may
be
some
wit
in
it
for
aught
he
knows
but
no
judgment
at
all
and
triptolemus
and
phutatorius
agreeing
thereto
ask
how
is
it
possible
there
should
for
that
wit
and
judgment
in
this
world
never
go
together
inasmuch
as
they
are
two
operations
differing
from
each
other
as
wide
as
east
from
west
so
says
locke
so
are
farting
and
hickuping
say
i
but
in
answer
to
this
didius
the
great
church
lawyer
in
his
code
de
fartendi
et
illustrandi
fallaciis
doth
maintain
and
make
fully
appear
that
an
illustration
is
no
argument
nor
do
i
maintain
the
wiping
of
a
clean
to
be
a
syllogism
but
you
all
may
it
please
your
worships
see
the
better
for
it
so
that
the
main
good
these
things
do
is
only
to
clarify
the
understanding
previous
to
the
application
of
the
argument
itself
in
order
to
free
it
from
any
little
motes
or
specks
of
opacular
matter
which
if
left
swimming
therein
might
hinder
a
conception
and
spoil
all
now
my
dear
and
thrice
able
criticks
and
for
to
you
i
write
this
preface
and
to
you
most
subtle
statesmen
and
discreet
doctors
do
pull
off
your
beards
renowned
for
gravity
and
wisdom
monopolus
my
politician
didius
my
counsel
kysarcius
my
friend
phutatorius
my
guide
gastripheres
the
preserver
of
my
life
somnolentius
the
balm
and
repose
of
it
not
forgetting
all
others
as
well
sleeping
as
waking
ecclesiastical
as
civil
whom
for
brevity
but
out
of
no
resentment
to
you
i
lump
all
believe
me
right
worthy
my
most
zealous
wish
and
fervent
prayer
in
your
behalf
and
in
my
own
too
in
case
the
thing
is
not
done
already
for
us
is
that
the
great
gifts
and
endowments
both
of
wit
and
judgment
with
every
thing
which
usually
goes
along
with
them
such
as
memory
fancy
genius
eloquence
quick
parts
and
what
not
may
this
precious
moment
without
stint
or
measure
let
or
hindrance
be
poured
down
warm
as
each
of
us
could
bear
it
scum
and
sediment
and
all
for
i
would
not
have
a
drop
lost
into
the
several
receptacles
cells
cellules
domiciles
dormitories
refectories
and
spare
places
of
our
brains
in
such
sort
that
they
might
continue
to
be
injected
and
tunn
into
according
to
the
true
intent
and
meaning
of
my
wish
until
every
vessel
of
them
both
great
and
small
be
so
replenish
saturated
and
filled
up
therewith
that
no
more
would
it
save
a
man
life
could
possibly
be
got
either
in
or
out
bless
us
what
noble
work
we
should
make
how
should
i
tickle
it
off
and
what
spirits
should
i
find
myself
in
to
be
writing
away
for
such
readers
and
you
just
heaven
with
what
raptures
would
you
sit
and
read
but
oh
is
too
much
i
am
sick
i
faint
away
deliciously
at
the
thoughts
of
it
is
more
than
nature
can
bear
lay
hold
of
me
i
am
giddy
i
am
stone
blind
i
dying
i
am
help
help
help
but
hold
i
grow
something
better
again
for
i
am
beginning
to
foresee
when
this
is
over
that
as
we
shall
all
of
us
continue
to
be
great
wits
we
should
never
agree
amongst
ourselves
one
day
to
an
end
there
would
be
so
much
satire
and
sarcasm
scoffing
and
flouting
with
raillying
and
reparteeing
of
it
thrusting
and
parrying
in
one
corner
or
another
there
would
be
nothing
but
mischief
among
us
chaste
stars
what
biting
and
scratching
and
what
a
racket
and
a
clatter
we
should
make
what
with
breaking
of
heads
rapping
of
knuckles
and
hitting
of
sore
places
there
would
be
no
such
thing
as
living
for
us
but
then
again
as
we
should
all
of
us
be
men
of
great
judgment
we
should
make
up
matters
as
fast
as
ever
they
went
wrong
and
though
we
should
abominate
each
other
ten
times
worse
than
so
many
devils
or
devilesses
we
should
nevertheless
my
dear
creatures
be
all
courtesy
and
kindness
milk
and
honey
be
a
second
land
of
promise
a
paradise
upon
earth
if
there
was
such
a
thing
to
be
had
so
that
upon
the
whole
we
should
have
done
well
enough
all
i
fret
and
fume
at
and
what
most
distresses
my
invention
at
present
is
how
to
bring
the
point
itself
to
bear
for
as
your
worships
well
know
that
of
these
heavenly
emanations
of
wit
and
judgment
which
i
have
so
bountifully
wished
both
for
your
worships
and
myself
there
is
but
a
certain
quantum
stored
up
for
us
all
for
the
use
and
behoof
of
the
whole
race
of
mankind
and
such
small
modicums
of
are
only
sent
forth
into
this
wide
world
circulating
here
and
there
in
one
bye
corner
or
another
and
in
such
narrow
streams
and
at
such
prodigious
intervals
from
each
other
that
one
would
wonder
how
it
holds
out
or
could
be
sufficient
for
the
wants
and
emergencies
of
so
many
great
estates
and
populous
empires
indeed
there
is
one
thing
to
be
considered
that
in
nova
zembla
north
lapland
and
in
all
those
cold
and
dreary
tracks
of
the
globe
which
lie
more
directly
under
the
arctick
and
antartick
circles
where
the
whole
province
of
a
man
concernments
lies
for
near
nine
months
together
within
the
narrow
compass
of
his
cave
where
the
spirits
are
compressed
almost
to
nothing
and
where
the
passions
of
a
man
with
every
thing
which
belongs
to
them
are
as
frigid
as
the
zone
itself
there
the
least
quantity
of
judgment
imaginable
does
the
business
and
of
wit
there
is
a
total
and
an
absolute
saving
for
as
not
one
spark
is
wanted
so
not
one
spark
is
given
angels
and
ministers
of
grace
defend
us
what
a
dismal
thing
would
it
have
been
to
have
governed
a
kingdom
to
have
fought
a
battle
or
made
a
treaty
or
run
a
match
or
wrote
a
book
or
got
a
child
or
held
a
provincial
chapter
there
with
so
plentiful
a
lack
of
wit
and
judgment
about
us
for
mercy
sake
let
us
think
no
more
about
it
but
travel
on
as
fast
as
we
can
southwards
into
norway
crossing
over
swedeland
if
you
please
through
the
small
triangular
province
of
angermania
to
the
lake
of
bothmia
coasting
along
it
through
east
and
west
bothnia
down
to
carelia
and
so
on
through
all
those
states
and
provinces
which
border
upon
the
far
side
of
the
gulf
of
finland
and
the
of
the
baltick
up
to
petersbourg
and
just
stepping
into
ingria
then
stretching
over
directly
from
thence
through
the
north
parts
of
the
russian
empire
leaving
siberia
a
little
upon
the
left
hand
till
we
got
into
the
very
heart
of
russian
and
asiatick
tartary
now
through
this
long
tour
which
i
have
led
you
you
observe
the
good
people
are
better
off
by
far
than
in
the
polar
countries
which
we
have
just
left
for
if
you
hold
your
hand
over
your
eyes
and
look
very
attentively
you
may
perceive
some
small
glimmerings
as
it
were
of
wit
with
a
comfortable
provision
of
good
plain
houshold
judgment
which
taking
the
quality
and
quantity
of
it
together
they
make
a
very
good
shift
with
and
had
they
more
of
either
the
one
or
the
other
it
would
destroy
the
proper
balance
betwixt
them
and
i
am
satisfied
moreover
they
would
want
occasions
to
put
them
to
use
now
sir
if
i
conduct
you
home
again
into
this
warmer
and
more
luxuriant
island
where
you
perceive
the
of
our
blood
and
humours
runs
high
where
we
have
more
ambition
and
pride
and
envy
and
lechery
and
other
whoreson
passions
upon
our
hands
to
govern
and
subject
to
reason
the
height
of
our
wit
and
the
depth
of
our
judgment
you
see
are
exactly
proportioned
to
the
length
and
breadth
of
our
necessities
and
accordingly
we
have
them
sent
down
amongst
us
in
such
a
flowing
kind
of
decent
and
creditable
plenty
that
no
one
thinks
he
has
any
cause
to
complain
it
must
however
be
confessed
on
this
head
that
as
our
air
blows
hot
and
cold
wet
and
dry
ten
times
in
a
day
we
have
them
in
no
regular
and
settled
way
so
that
sometimes
for
near
half
a
century
together
there
shall
be
very
little
wit
or
judgment
either
to
be
seen
or
heard
of
amongst
us
the
small
channels
of
them
shall
seem
quite
dried
up
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
sluices
shall
break
out
and
take
a
fit
of
running
again
like
fury
you
would
think
they
would
never
stop
and
then
it
is
that
in
writing
and
fighting
and
twenty
other
gallant
things
we
drive
all
the
world
before
us
it
is
by
these
observations
and
a
wary
reasoning
by
analogy
in
that
kind
of
argumentative
process
which
suidas
calls
dialectick
induction
that
i
draw
and
set
up
this
position
as
most
true
and
veritable
that
of
these
two
luminaries
so
much
of
their
irradiations
are
suffered
from
time
to
time
to
shine
down
upon
us
as
he
whose
infinite
wisdom
which
dispenses
every
thing
in
exact
weight
and
measure
knows
will
just
serve
to
light
us
on
our
way
in
this
night
of
our
obscurity
so
that
your
reverences
and
worships
now
find
out
nor
is
it
a
moment
longer
in
my
power
to
conceal
it
from
you
that
the
fervent
wish
in
your
behalf
with
which
i
set
out
was
no
more
than
the
first
insinuating
how
d
of
a
caressing
prefacer
stifling
his
reader
as
a
lover
sometimes
does
a
coy
mistress
into
silence
for
alas
could
this
effusion
of
light
have
been
as
easily
procured
as
the
exordium
wished
it
i
tremble
to
think
how
many
thousands
for
it
of
benighted
travellers
in
the
learned
sciences
at
least
must
have
groped
and
blundered
on
in
the
dark
all
the
nights
of
their
lives
running
their
heads
against
posts
and
knocking
out
their
brains
without
ever
getting
to
their
journies
end
some
falling
with
their
noses
perpendicularly
into
sinks
others
horizontally
with
their
tails
into
kennels
here
one
half
of
a
learned
profession
tilting
full
but
against
the
other
half
of
it
and
then
tumbling
and
rolling
one
over
the
other
in
the
dirt
like
here
the
brethren
of
another
profession
who
should
have
run
in
opposition
to
each
other
flying
on
the
contrary
like
a
flock
of
wild
geese
all
in
a
row
the
same
what
confusion
what
mistakes
fiddlers
and
painters
judging
by
their
eyes
and
ears
admirable
trusting
to
the
passions
excited
in
an
air
sung
or
a
story
painted
to
the
heart
instead
of
measuring
them
by
a
quadrant
in
the
of
this
picture
a
statesman
turning
the
political
wheel
like
a
brute
the
wrong
way
round
against
the
stream
of
corruption
by
heaven
instead
of
with
it
in
this
corner
a
son
of
the
divine
esculapius
writing
a
book
against
predestination
perhaps
worse
feeling
his
patient
pulse
instead
of
his
apothecary
a
brother
of
the
faculty
in
the
upon
his
knees
in
tears
drawing
the
curtains
of
a
mangled
victim
to
beg
his
forgiveness
offering
a
fee
instead
of
taking
one
in
that
spacious
hall
a
coalition
of
the
gown
from
all
the
bars
of
it
driving
a
damn
dirty
vexatious
cause
before
them
with
all
their
might
and
main
the
wrong
way
kicking
it
out
of
the
great
doors
instead
of
in
and
with
such
fury
in
their
looks
and
such
a
degree
of
inveteracy
in
their
manner
of
kicking
it
as
if
the
laws
had
been
originally
made
for
the
peace
and
preservation
of
mankind
perhaps
a
more
enormous
mistake
committed
by
them
still
a
litigated
point
fairly
hung
up
for
instance
whether
john
his
nose
could
stand
in
tom
his
face
without
a
trespass
or
not
rashly
determined
by
them
in
minutes
which
with
the
cautious
pros
and
cons
required
in
so
intricate
a
proceeding
might
have
taken
up
as
many
months
and
if
carried
on
upon
a
military
plan
as
your
honours
know
an
action
should
be
with
all
the
stratagems
practicable
therein
such
as
feints
forced
marches
surprizes
ambuscades
and
a
thousand
other
strokes
of
generalship
which
consist
in
catching
at
all
advantages
on
both
sides
might
reasonably
have
lasted
them
as
many
years
finding
food
and
raiment
all
that
term
for
a
centumvirate
of
the
profession
as
for
the
clergy
no
if
i
say
a
word
against
them
i
be
i
have
no
desire
and
besides
if
i
had
i
durst
not
for
my
soul
touch
upon
the
subject
with
such
weak
nerves
and
spirits
and
in
the
condition
i
am
in
at
present
be
as
much
as
my
life
was
worth
to
deject
and
contrist
myself
with
so
bad
and
melancholy
an
account
and
therefore
is
safer
to
draw
a
curtain
across
and
hasten
from
it
as
fast
as
i
can
to
the
main
and
principal
point
i
have
undertaken
to
clear
up
and
that
is
how
it
comes
to
pass
that
your
men
of
least
wit
are
reported
to
be
men
of
most
but
mark
i
say
reported
to
be
for
it
is
no
more
my
dear
sirs
than
a
report
and
which
like
twenty
others
taken
up
every
day
upon
trust
i
maintain
to
be
a
vile
and
a
malicious
report
into
the
bargain
this
by
the
help
of
the
observation
already
premised
and
i
hope
already
weighed
and
perpended
by
your
reverences
and
worships
i
shall
forthwith
make
appear
i
hate
set
dissertations
and
above
all
things
in
the
world
is
one
of
the
silliest
things
in
one
of
them
to
darken
your
hypothesis
by
placing
a
number
of
tall
opake
words
one
before
another
in
a
right
line
betwixt
your
own
and
your
reader
conception
when
in
all
likelihood
if
you
had
looked
about
you
might
have
seen
something
standing
or
hanging
up
which
would
have
cleared
the
point
at
once
what
hindrance
hurt
or
harm
doth
the
laudable
desire
of
knowledge
bring
to
any
man
if
even
from
a
sot
a
pot
a
fool
a
stool
a
a
truckle
for
a
pully
the
lid
of
a
goldsmith
crucible
an
oil
bottle
an
old
slipper
or
a
cane
chair
i
am
this
moment
sitting
upon
one
will
you
give
me
leave
to
illustrate
this
affair
of
wit
and
judgment
by
the
two
knobs
on
the
top
of
the
back
of
it
they
are
fastened
on
you
see
with
two
pegs
stuck
slightly
into
two
and
will
place
what
i
have
to
say
in
so
clear
a
light
as
to
let
you
see
through
the
drift
and
meaning
of
my
whole
preface
as
plainly
as
if
every
point
and
particle
of
it
was
made
up
of
i
enter
now
directly
upon
the
point
here
stands
wit
and
there
stands
judgment
close
beside
it
just
like
the
two
knobs
i
speaking
of
upon
the
back
of
this
chair
on
which
i
am
sitting
you
see
they
are
the
highest
and
most
ornamental
parts
of
its
frame
as
wit
and
judgment
are
of
ours
and
like
them
too
indubitably
both
made
and
fitted
to
go
together
in
order
as
we
say
in
all
such
cases
of
duplicated
embellishments
to
answer
one
another
now
for
the
sake
of
an
experiment
and
for
the
clearer
illustrating
this
matter
let
us
for
a
moment
take
off
one
of
these
two
curious
ornaments
i
care
not
which
from
the
point
or
pinnacle
of
the
chair
it
now
stands
on
nay
do
laugh
at
it
but
did
you
ever
see
in
the
whole
course
of
your
lives
such
a
ridiculous
business
as
this
has
made
of
it
why
as
miserable
a
sight
as
a
sow
with
one
ear
and
there
is
just
as
much
sense
and
symmetry
in
the
one
as
in
the
other
do
pray
get
off
your
seats
only
to
take
a
view
of
it
now
would
any
man
who
valued
his
character
a
straw
have
turned
a
piece
of
work
out
of
his
hand
in
such
a
condition
nay
lay
your
hands
upon
your
hearts
and
answer
this
plain
question
whether
this
one
single
knob
which
now
stands
here
like
a
blockhead
by
itself
can
serve
any
purpose
upon
earth
but
to
put
one
in
mind
of
the
want
of
the
other
and
let
me
farther
ask
in
case
the
chair
was
your
own
if
you
would
not
in
your
consciences
think
rather
than
be
as
it
is
that
it
would
be
ten
times
better
without
any
knob
at
all
now
these
two
knobs
or
top
ornaments
of
the
mind
of
man
which
crown
the
whole
entablature
being
as
i
said
wit
and
judgment
which
of
all
others
as
i
have
proved
it
are
the
most
needful
the
most
priz
the
most
calamitous
to
be
without
and
consequently
the
hardest
to
come
at
for
all
these
reasons
put
together
there
is
not
a
mortal
among
us
so
destitute
of
a
love
of
good
fame
or
feeding
or
so
ignorant
of
what
will
do
him
good
therein
who
does
not
wish
and
stedfastly
resolve
in
his
own
mind
to
be
or
to
be
thought
at
least
master
of
the
one
or
the
other
and
indeed
of
both
of
them
if
the
thing
seems
any
way
feasible
or
likely
to
be
brought
to
pass
now
your
graver
gentry
having
little
or
no
kind
of
chance
in
aiming
at
the
one
unless
they
laid
hold
of
the
other
pray
what
do
you
think
would
become
of
them
why
sirs
in
spite
of
all
their
gravities
they
must
have
been
contented
to
have
gone
with
their
insides
naked
this
was
not
to
be
borne
but
by
an
effort
of
philosophy
not
to
be
supposed
in
the
case
we
are
upon
so
that
no
one
could
well
have
been
angry
with
them
had
they
been
satisfied
with
what
little
they
could
have
snatched
up
and
secreted
under
their
cloaks
and
great
perriwigs
had
they
not
raised
a
hue
and
cry
at
the
same
time
against
the
lawful
owners
i
need
not
tell
your
worships
that
this
was
done
with
so
much
cunning
and
artifice
that
the
great
locke
who
was
seldom
outwitted
by
false
sounds
was
nevertheless
bubbled
here
the
cry
it
seems
was
so
deep
and
solemn
a
one
and
what
with
the
help
of
great
wigs
grave
faces
and
other
implements
of
deceit
was
rendered
so
general
a
one
against
the
poor
wits
in
this
matter
that
the
philosopher
himself
was
deceived
by
it
it
was
his
glory
to
free
the
world
from
the
lumber
of
a
thousand
vulgar
errors
but
this
was
not
of
the
number
so
that
instead
of
sitting
down
coolly
as
such
a
philosopher
should
have
done
to
have
examined
the
matter
of
fact
before
he
philosophised
upon
it
on
the
contrary
he
took
the
fact
for
granted
and
so
joined
in
with
the
cry
and
halloo
it
as
boisterously
as
the
rest
this
has
been
made
the
magna
charta
of
stupidity
ever
since
but
your
reverences
plainly
see
it
has
been
obtained
in
such
a
manner
that
the
title
to
it
is
not
worth
a
groat
which
is
one
of
the
many
and
vile
impositions
which
gravity
and
grave
folks
have
to
answer
for
hereafter
as
for
great
wigs
upon
which
i
may
be
thought
to
have
spoken
my
mind
too
freely
i
beg
leave
to
qualify
whatever
has
been
unguardedly
said
to
their
dispraise
or
prejudice
by
one
general
declaration
that
i
have
no
abhorrence
whatever
nor
do
i
detest
and
abjure
either
great
wigs
or
long
beards
any
farther
than
when
i
see
they
are
bespoke
and
let
grow
on
purpose
to
carry
on
this
imposture
for
any
purpose
peace
be
with
them
mark
only
i
write
not
for
them
chapter
every
day
for
at
least
ten
years
together
did
my
father
resolve
to
have
it
mended
is
not
mended
yet
no
family
but
ours
would
have
borne
with
it
an
hour
and
what
is
most
astonishing
there
was
not
a
subject
in
the
world
upon
which
my
father
was
so
eloquent
as
upon
that
of
and
yet
at
the
same
time
he
was
certainly
one
of
the
greatest
bubbles
to
them
i
think
that
history
can
produce
his
rhetorick
and
conduct
were
at
perpetual
never
did
the
open
but
his
philosophy
or
his
principles
fell
a
victim
to
it
three
drops
of
oil
with
a
feather
and
a
smart
stroke
of
a
hammer
had
saved
his
honour
for
ever
inconsistent
soul
that
man
is
languishing
under
wounds
which
he
has
the
power
to
heal
his
whole
life
a
contradiction
to
his
knowledge
his
reason
that
precious
gift
of
god
to
him
instead
of
pouring
in
oil
serving
but
to
sharpen
his
sensibilities
to
multiply
his
pains
and
render
him
more
melancholy
and
uneasy
under
them
poor
unhappy
creature
that
he
should
do
so
are
not
the
necessary
causes
of
misery
in
this
life
enow
but
he
must
add
voluntary
ones
to
his
stock
of
sorrow
struggle
against
evils
which
can
not
be
avoided
and
submit
to
others
which
a
tenth
part
of
the
trouble
they
create
him
would
remove
from
his
heart
for
ever
by
all
that
is
good
and
virtuous
if
there
are
three
drops
of
oil
to
be
got
and
a
hammer
to
be
found
within
ten
miles
of
shandy
hall
the
parlour
door
hinge
shall
be
mended
this
reign
chapter
when
corporal
trim
had
brought
his
two
mortars
to
bear
he
was
delighted
with
his
above
measure
and
knowing
what
a
pleasure
it
would
be
to
his
master
to
see
them
he
was
not
able
to
resist
the
desire
he
had
of
carrying
them
directly
into
his
parlour
now
next
to
the
moral
lesson
i
had
in
view
in
mentioning
the
affair
of
hinges
i
had
a
speculative
consideration
arising
out
of
it
and
it
is
this
had
the
parlour
door
opened
and
turn
upon
its
hinges
as
a
door
should
do
or
for
example
as
cleverly
as
our
government
has
been
turning
upon
its
hinges
that
is
in
case
things
have
all
along
gone
well
with
your
worship
otherwise
i
give
up
my
simile
in
this
case
i
say
there
had
been
no
danger
either
to
master
or
man
in
corporal
trim
peeping
in
the
moment
he
had
beheld
my
father
and
my
uncle
toby
fast
asleep
the
respectfulness
of
his
carriage
was
such
he
would
have
retired
as
silent
as
death
and
left
them
both
in
their
dreaming
as
happy
as
he
had
found
them
but
the
thing
was
morally
speaking
so
very
impracticable
that
for
the
many
years
in
which
this
hinge
was
suffered
to
be
out
of
order
and
amongst
the
hourly
grievances
my
father
submitted
to
upon
its
account
this
was
one
that
he
never
folded
his
arms
to
take
his
nap
after
dinner
but
the
thoughts
of
being
unavoidably
awakened
by
the
first
person
who
should
open
the
door
was
always
uppermost
in
his
imagination
and
so
incessantly
stepp
in
betwixt
him
and
the
first
balmy
presage
of
his
repose
as
to
rob
him
as
he
often
declared
of
the
whole
sweets
of
it
things
move
upon
bad
hinges
an
please
your
lordships
how
can
it
be
otherwise
pray
what
the
matter
who
is
there
cried
my
father
waking
the
moment
the
door
began
to
i
wish
the
smith
would
give
a
peep
at
that
confounded
is
nothing
an
please
your
honour
said
trim
but
two
mortars
i
am
bringing
they
sha
make
a
clatter
with
them
here
cried
my
father
if
slop
has
any
drugs
to
pound
let
him
do
it
in
the
may
it
please
your
honour
cried
trim
they
are
two
for
a
siege
next
summer
which
i
have
been
making
out
of
a
pair
of
which
obadiah
told
me
your
honour
had
left
off
by
heaven
cried
my
father
springing
out
of
his
chair
as
he
swore
i
have
not
one
appointment
belonging
to
me
which
i
set
so
much
store
by
as
i
do
by
these
they
were
our
great
grandfather
brother
toby
they
were
hereditary
then
i
fear
quoth
my
uncle
toby
trim
has
cut
off
the
i
have
only
cut
off
the
tops
an
please
your
honour
cried
trim
i
hate
perpetuities
as
much
as
any
man
alive
cried
my
father
but
these
continued
he
smiling
though
very
angry
at
the
same
time
have
been
in
the
family
brother
ever
since
the
civil
wars
sir
roger
shandy
wore
them
at
the
battle
of
i
declare
i
would
not
have
taken
ten
pounds
for
i
pay
you
the
money
brother
shandy
quoth
my
uncle
toby
looking
at
the
two
mortars
with
infinite
pleasure
and
putting
his
hand
into
his
breeches
pocket
as
he
viewed
them
i
pay
you
the
ten
pounds
this
moment
with
all
my
heart
and
brother
toby
replied
my
father
altering
his
tone
you
care
not
what
money
you
dissipate
and
throw
away
provided
continued
he
is
but
upon
a
have
i
not
one
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
a
year
besides
my
half
pay
cried
my
uncle
what
is
that
replied
my
father
hastily
to
ten
pounds
for
a
pair
of
twelve
guineas
for
your
pontoons
half
as
much
for
your
dutch
to
say
nothing
of
the
train
of
little
brass
artillery
you
bespoke
last
week
with
twenty
other
preparations
for
the
siege
of
messina
believe
me
dear
brother
toby
continued
my
father
taking
him
kindly
by
the
hand
these
military
operations
of
yours
are
above
your
strength
you
mean
well
brother
but
they
carry
you
into
greater
expences
than
you
were
first
aware
of
and
take
my
word
dear
toby
they
will
in
the
end
quite
ruin
your
fortune
and
make
a
beggar
of
what
signifies
it
if
they
do
brother
replied
my
uncle
toby
so
long
as
we
know
is
for
the
good
of
the
nation
my
father
could
not
help
smiling
for
his
soul
his
anger
at
the
worst
was
never
more
than
a
spark
and
the
zeal
and
simplicity
of
trim
and
the
generous
though
gallantry
of
my
uncle
toby
brought
him
into
perfect
good
humour
with
them
in
an
instant
generous
souls
god
prosper
you
both
and
your
too
quoth
my
father
to
himself
chapter
all
is
quiet
and
hush
cried
my
father
at
least
above
stairs
i
hear
not
one
foot
prithee
trim
who
in
the
kitchen
there
is
no
one
soul
in
the
kitchen
answered
trim
making
a
low
bow
as
he
spoke
except
dr
confusion
cried
my
father
getting
upon
his
legs
a
second
time
not
one
single
thing
has
gone
right
this
day
had
i
faith
in
astrology
brother
which
by
the
bye
my
father
had
i
would
have
sworn
some
retrograde
planet
was
hanging
over
this
unfortunate
house
of
mine
and
turning
every
individual
thing
in
it
out
of
its
why
i
thought
slop
had
been
above
stairs
with
my
wife
and
so
said
what
can
the
fellow
be
puzzling
about
in
the
kitchen
he
is
busy
an
please
your
honour
replied
trim
in
making
a
is
very
obliging
in
him
quoth
my
uncle
toby
pray
give
my
humble
service
to
slop
trim
and
tell
him
i
thank
him
heartily
you
must
know
my
uncle
toby
mistook
the
bridge
as
widely
as
my
father
mistook
the
mortars
but
to
understand
how
my
uncle
toby
could
mistake
the
bridge
i
fear
i
must
give
you
an
exact
account
of
the
road
which
led
to
it
or
to
drop
my
metaphor
for
there
is
nothing
more
dishonest
in
an
historian
than
the
use
of
one
in
order
to
conceive
the
probability
of
this
error
in
my
uncle
toby
aright
i
must
give
you
some
account
of
an
adventure
of
trim
though
much
against
my
will
i
say
much
against
my
will
only
because
the
story
in
one
sense
is
certainly
out
of
its
place
here
for
by
right
it
should
come
in
either
amongst
the
anecdotes
of
my
uncle
toby
amours
with
widow
wadman
in
which
corporal
trim
was
no
mean
actor
or
else
in
the
middle
of
his
and
my
uncle
toby
campaigns
on
the
for
it
will
do
very
well
in
either
place
but
then
if
i
reserve
it
for
either
of
those
parts
of
my
story
i
ruin
the
story
i
upon
and
if
i
tell
it
here
i
anticipate
matters
and
ruin
it
there
what
would
your
worship
have
me
to
do
in
this
case
tell
it
shandy
by
all
you
are
a
fool
tristram
if
you
do
o
ye
powers
for
powers
ye
are
and
great
ones
too
which
enable
mortal
man
to
tell
a
story
worth
the
hearing
that
kindly
shew
him
where
he
is
to
begin
it
and
where
he
is
to
end
it
what
he
is
to
put
into
it
and
what
he
is
to
leave
out
how
much
of
it
he
is
to
cast
into
a
shade
and
whereabouts
he
is
to
throw
his
light
ye
who
preside
over
this
vast
empire
of
biographical
freebooters
and
see
how
many
scrapes
and
plunges
your
subjects
hourly
fall
into
will
you
do
one
thing
i
beg
and
beseech
you
in
case
you
will
do
nothing
better
for
us
that
wherever
in
any
part
of
your
dominions
it
so
falls
out
that
three
several
roads
meet
in
one
point
as
they
have
done
just
here
that
at
least
you
set
up
a
in
the
centre
of
them
in
mere
charity
to
direct
an
uncertain
devil
which
of
the
three
he
is
to
take
chapter
tho
the
shock
my
uncle
toby
received
the
year
after
the
demolition
of
dunkirk
in
his
affair
with
widow
wadman
had
fixed
him
in
a
resolution
never
more
to
think
of
the
sex
or
of
aught
which
belonged
to
it
yet
corporal
trim
had
made
no
such
bargain
with
himself
indeed
in
my
uncle
toby
case
there
was
a
strange
and
unaccountable
concurrence
of
circumstances
which
insensibly
drew
him
in
to
lay
siege
to
that
fair
and
strong
in
trim
case
there
was
a
concurrence
of
nothing
in
the
world
but
of
him
and
bridget
in
the
kitchen
though
in
truth
the
love
and
veneration
he
bore
his
master
was
such
and
so
fond
was
he
of
imitating
him
in
all
he
did
that
had
my
uncle
toby
employed
his
time
and
genius
in
tagging
of
points
i
am
persuaded
the
honest
corporal
would
have
laid
down
his
arms
and
followed
his
example
with
pleasure
when
therefore
my
uncle
toby
sat
down
before
the
mistress
corporal
trim
incontinently
took
ground
before
the
maid
now
my
dear
friend
garrick
whom
i
have
so
much
cause
to
esteem
and
honour
why
or
wherefore
is
no
matter
can
it
escape
your
penetration
i
defy
it
that
so
many
and
opificers
of
have
ever
since
been
working
upon
trim
and
my
uncle
i
care
not
what
aristotle
or
pacuvius
or
bossu
or
ricaboni
say
though
i
never
read
one
of
them
there
is
not
a
greater
difference
between
a
chair
and
madam
pompadour
than
betwixt
a
single
amour
and
an
amour
thus
nobly
doubled
and
going
upon
all
four
prancing
throughout
a
grand
drama
sir
a
simple
single
silly
affair
of
that
kind
is
quite
lost
in
five
acts
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
after
a
series
of
attacks
and
repulses
in
a
course
of
nine
months
on
my
uncle
toby
quarter
a
most
minute
account
of
every
particular
of
which
shall
be
given
in
its
proper
place
my
uncle
toby
honest
man
found
it
necessary
to
draw
off
his
forces
and
raise
the
siege
somewhat
indignantly
corporal
trim
as
i
said
had
made
no
such
bargain
either
with
himself
or
with
any
one
else
the
fidelity
however
of
his
heart
not
suffering
him
to
go
into
a
house
which
his
master
had
forsaken
with
disgust
he
contented
himself
with
turning
his
part
of
the
siege
into
a
blockade
that
is
he
kept
others
off
for
though
he
never
after
went
to
the
house
yet
he
never
met
bridget
in
the
village
but
he
would
either
nod
or
wink
or
smile
or
look
kindly
at
her
or
as
circumstances
directed
he
would
shake
her
by
the
hand
or
ask
her
lovingly
how
she
did
or
would
give
her
a
ribbon
and
though
never
but
when
it
could
be
done
with
decorum
would
give
bridget
a
precisely
in
this
situation
did
these
things
stand
for
five
years
that
is
from
the
demolition
of
dunkirk
in
the
year
to
the
latter
end
of
my
uncle
toby
campaign
in
the
year
which
was
about
six
or
seven
weeks
before
the
time
i
speaking
when
trim
as
his
custom
was
after
he
had
put
my
uncle
toby
to
bed
going
down
one
night
to
see
that
every
thing
was
right
at
his
fortifications
in
the
lane
separated
from
the
with
flowering
shrubs
and
holly
he
espied
his
bridget
as
the
corporal
thought
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
so
well
worth
shewing
as
the
glorious
works
which
he
and
my
uncle
toby
had
made
trim
courteously
and
gallantly
took
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
in
this
was
not
done
so
privately
but
that
the
trumpet
of
fame
carried
it
from
ear
to
ear
till
at
length
it
reach
my
father
with
this
untoward
circumstance
along
with
it
that
my
uncle
toby
curious
constructed
and
painted
after
the
dutch
fashion
and
which
went
quite
across
the
ditch
was
broke
down
and
somehow
or
other
crushed
all
to
pieces
that
very
night
my
father
as
you
have
observed
had
no
great
esteem
for
my
uncle
he
thought
it
the
most
ridiculous
horse
that
ever
gentleman
mounted
and
indeed
unless
my
uncle
toby
vexed
him
about
it
could
never
think
of
it
once
without
smiling
at
it
so
that
it
could
never
get
lame
or
happen
any
mischance
but
it
tickled
my
father
imagination
beyond
measure
but
this
being
an
accident
much
more
to
his
humour
than
any
one
which
had
yet
it
it
proved
an
inexhaustible
fund
of
entertainment
to
him
well
but
dear
toby
my
father
would
say
do
tell
me
seriously
how
this
affair
of
the
bridge
how
can
you
teaze
me
so
much
about
it
my
uncle
toby
would
reply
i
have
told
it
you
twenty
times
word
for
word
as
trim
told
it
prithee
how
was
it
then
corporal
my
father
would
cry
turning
to
it
was
a
mere
misfortune
an
please
your
honour
i
was
shewing
bridget
our
fortifications
and
in
going
too
near
the
edge
of
the
fosse
i
unfortunately
slipp
in
very
well
trim
my
father
would
cry
smiling
mysteriously
and
giving
a
nod
but
without
interrupting
him
and
being
link
fast
an
please
your
honour
arm
in
arm
with
bridget
i
dragg
her
after
me
by
means
of
which
she
fell
backwards
soss
against
the
bridge
and
trim
foot
my
uncle
toby
would
cry
taking
the
story
out
of
his
mouth
getting
into
the
cuvette
he
tumbled
full
against
the
bridge
it
was
a
thousand
to
one
my
uncle
toby
would
add
that
the
poor
fellow
did
not
break
his
ay
truly
my
father
would
say
a
limb
is
soon
broke
brother
toby
in
such
and
so
please
your
honour
the
bridge
which
your
honour
knows
was
a
very
slight
one
was
broke
down
betwixt
us
and
splintered
all
to
pieces
at
other
times
but
especially
when
my
uncle
toby
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
say
a
syllable
about
cannons
bombs
or
petards
my
father
would
exhaust
all
the
stores
of
his
eloquence
which
indeed
were
very
great
in
a
panegyric
upon
the
of
the
ancients
the
vinea
which
alexander
made
use
of
at
the
siege
of
he
would
tell
my
uncle
toby
of
the
catapultae
of
the
syrians
which
threw
such
monstrous
stones
so
many
hundred
feet
and
shook
the
strongest
bulwarks
from
their
very
foundation
he
would
go
on
and
describe
the
wonderful
mechanism
of
the
ballista
which
marcellinus
makes
so
much
rout
about
the
terrible
effects
of
the
pyraboli
which
cast
fire
the
danger
of
the
terebra
and
scorpio
which
cast
but
what
are
these
would
he
say
to
the
destructive
machinery
of
corporal
trim
believe
me
brother
toby
no
bridge
or
bastion
or
that
ever
was
constructed
in
this
world
can
hold
out
against
such
artillery
my
uncle
toby
would
never
attempt
any
defence
against
the
force
of
this
ridicule
but
that
of
redoubling
the
vehemence
of
smoaking
his
pipe
in
doing
which
he
raised
so
dense
a
vapour
one
night
after
supper
that
it
set
my
father
who
was
a
little
phthisical
into
a
suffocating
fit
of
violent
coughing
my
uncle
toby
leap
up
without
feeling
the
pain
upon
his
groin
and
with
infinite
pity
stood
beside
his
brother
chair
tapping
his
back
with
one
hand
and
holding
his
head
with
the
other
and
from
time
to
time
wiping
his
eyes
with
a
clean
cambrick
handkerchief
which
he
pulled
out
of
his
the
affectionate
and
endearing
manner
in
which
my
uncle
toby
did
these
little
offices
cut
my
father
thro
his
reins
for
the
pain
he
had
just
been
giving
may
my
brains
be
knock
out
with
a
or
a
catapulta
i
care
not
which
quoth
my
father
to
himself
if
ever
i
insult
this
worthy
soul
more
chapter
the
being
held
irreparable
trim
was
ordered
directly
to
set
about
another
but
not
upon
the
same
model
for
cardinal
intrigues
at
that
time
being
discovered
and
my
uncle
toby
rightly
foreseeing
that
a
flame
would
inevitably
break
out
betwixt
spain
and
the
empire
and
that
the
operations
of
the
ensuing
campaign
must
in
all
likelihood
be
either
in
naples
or
sicily
he
determined
upon
an
italian
bridge
my
uncle
toby
was
not
far
out
of
his
conjectures
but
my
father
who
was
infinitely
the
better
politician
and
took
the
lead
as
far
of
my
uncle
toby
in
the
cabinet
as
my
uncle
toby
took
it
of
him
in
the
field
convinced
him
that
if
the
king
of
spain
and
the
emperor
went
together
by
the
ears
england
and
france
and
holland
must
by
force
of
their
all
enter
the
lists
too
and
if
so
he
would
say
the
combatants
brother
toby
as
sure
as
we
are
alive
will
fall
to
it
again
upon
the
old
stage
of
flanders
then
what
will
you
do
with
your
italian
bridge
we
will
go
on
with
it
then
upon
the
old
model
cried
my
uncle
toby
when
corporal
trim
had
about
half
finished
it
in
that
style
my
uncle
toby
found
out
a
capital
defect
in
it
which
he
had
never
thoroughly
considered
before
it
turned
it
seems
upon
hinges
at
both
ends
of
it
opening
in
the
middle
one
half
of
which
turning
to
one
side
of
the
fosse
and
the
other
to
the
other
the
advantage
of
which
was
this
that
by
dividing
the
weight
of
the
bridge
into
two
equal
portions
it
impowered
my
uncle
toby
to
raise
it
up
or
let
it
down
with
the
end
of
his
crutch
and
with
one
hand
which
as
his
garrison
was
weak
was
as
much
as
he
could
well
spare
but
the
disadvantages
of
such
a
construction
were
insurmountable
for
by
this
means
he
would
say
i
leave
one
half
of
my
bridge
in
my
enemy
possession
and
pray
of
what
use
is
the
other
the
natural
remedy
for
this
was
no
doubt
to
have
his
bridge
fast
only
at
one
end
with
hinges
so
that
the
whole
might
be
lifted
up
together
and
stand
bolt
upright
but
that
was
rejected
for
the
reason
given
above
for
a
whole
week
after
he
was
determined
in
his
mind
to
have
one
of
that
particular
construction
which
is
made
to
draw
back
horizontally
to
hinder
a
passage
and
to
thrust
forwards
again
to
gain
a
passage
of
which
sorts
your
worship
might
have
seen
three
famous
ones
at
spires
before
its
destruction
and
one
now
at
brisac
if
i
mistake
not
but
my
father
advising
my
uncle
toby
with
great
earnestness
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
thrusting
bridges
and
my
uncle
foreseeing
moreover
that
it
would
but
perpetuate
the
memory
of
the
corporal
misfortune
he
changed
his
mind
for
that
of
the
marquis
invention
which
the
younger
bernouilli
has
so
well
and
learnedly
described
as
your
worships
may
see
act
erud
lips
an
to
these
a
lead
weight
is
an
eternal
balance
and
keeps
watch
as
well
as
a
couple
of
centinels
inasmuch
as
the
construction
of
them
was
a
curve
line
approximating
to
a
cycloid
if
not
a
cycloid
itself
my
uncle
toby
understood
the
nature
of
a
parabola
as
well
as
any
man
in
england
but
was
not
quite
such
a
master
of
the
cycloid
he
talked
however
about
it
every
day
the
bridge
went
not
we
ask
somebody
about
it
cried
my
uncle
toby
to
trim
chapter
when
trim
came
in
and
told
my
father
that
slop
was
in
the
kitchen
and
busy
in
making
a
bridge
my
uncle
toby
the
affair
of
the
having
just
then
raised
a
train
of
military
ideas
in
his
brain
took
it
instantly
for
granted
that
slop
was
making
a
model
of
the
marquis
is
very
obliging
in
him
quoth
my
uncle
toby
pray
give
my
humble
service
to
slop
trim
and
tell
him
i
thank
him
heartily
had
my
uncle
toby
head
been
a
savoyard
box
and
my
father
peeping
in
all
the
time
at
one
end
of
it
it
could
not
have
given
him
a
more
distinct
conception
of
the
operations
of
my
uncle
toby
imagination
than
what
he
had
so
notwithstanding
the
catapulta
and
and
his
bitter
imprecation
about
them
he
was
just
beginning
to
triumph
when
trim
answer
in
an
instant
tore
the
laurel
from
his
brows
and
twisted
it
to
pieces
chapter
this
unfortunate
of
yours
quoth
my
father

bless
your
honour
cried

a
bridge
for
master
in
bringing
him
into
the
world
with
his
vile
instruments
he
has
crushed
his
nose
susannah
says
as
flat
as
a
pancake
to
his
face
and
he
is
making
a
false
bridge
with
a
piece
of
cotton
and
a
thin
piece
of
whalebone
out
of

to

up
lead
me
brother
toby
cried
my
father
to
my
room
this
instant
chapter
from
the
first
moment
i
sat
down
to
write
my
life
for
the
amusement
of
the
world
and
my
opinions
for
its
instruction
has
a
cloud
insensibly
been
gathering
over
my
a
tide
of
little
evils
and
distresses
has
been
setting
in
against
not
one
thing
as
he
observed
himself
has
gone
right
and
now
is
the
storm
thicken
and
going
to
break
and
pour
down
full
upon
his
head
i
enter
upon
this
part
of
my
story
in
the
most
pensive
and
melancholy
frame
of
mind
that
ever
sympathetic
breast
was
touched
my
nerves
relax
as
i
tell
every
line
i
write
i
feel
an
abatement
of
the
quickness
of
my
pulse
and
of
that
careless
alacrity
with
it
which
every
day
of
my
life
prompts
me
to
say
and
write
a
thousand
things
i
should
not
and
this
moment
that
i
last
dipp
my
pen
into
my
ink
i
could
not
help
taking
notice
what
a
cautious
air
of
sad
composure
and
solemnity
there
appear
in
my
manner
of
doing
lord
how
different
from
the
rash
jerks
and
squirts
thou
art
wont
tristram
to
transact
it
with
in
other
humours
dropping
thy
pen
spurting
thy
ink
about
thy
table
and
thy
books
as
if
thy
pen
and
thy
ink
thy
books
and
furniture
cost
thee
nothing
chapter
i
wo
go
about
to
argue
the
point
with
you
is
so
and
i
am
persuaded
of
it
madam
as
much
as
can
be
both
man
and
woman
bear
pain
or
sorrow
and
for
aught
i
know
pleasure
too
best
in
a
horizontal
position
the
moment
my
father
got
up
into
his
chamber
he
threw
himself
prostrate
across
his
bed
in
the
wildest
disorder
imaginable
but
at
the
same
time
in
the
most
lamentable
attitude
of
a
man
borne
down
with
sorrows
that
ever
the
eye
of
pity
dropp
a
tear
the
palm
of
his
right
hand
as
he
fell
upon
the
bed
receiving
his
forehead
and
covering
the
greatest
part
of
both
his
eyes
gently
sunk
down
with
his
head
his
elbow
giving
way
backwards
till
his
nose
touch
the
quilt
his
left
arm
hung
insensible
over
the
side
of
the
bed
his
knuckles
reclining
upon
the
handle
of
the
which
peep
out
beyond
the
valance
his
right
leg
his
left
being
drawn
up
towards
his
body
hung
half
over
the
side
of
the
bed
the
edge
of
it
pressing
upon
his
shin
bone
he
felt
it
not
a
fix
inflexible
sorrow
took
possession
of
every
line
of
his
he
sigh
once
heaved
his
breast
often
but
uttered
not
a
word
an
old
chair
valanced
and
fringed
around
with
party
coloured
worsted
bobs
stood
at
the
bed
head
opposite
to
the
side
where
my
father
head
my
uncle
toby
sat
him
down
in
it
before
an
affliction
is
digested
consolation
ever
comes
too
soon
and
after
it
is
digested
it
comes
too
late
so
that
you
see
madam
there
is
but
a
mark
between
these
two
as
fine
almost
as
a
hair
for
a
comforter
to
take
aim
at
my
uncle
toby
was
always
either
on
this
side
or
on
that
of
it
and
would
often
say
he
believed
in
his
heart
he
could
as
soon
hit
the
longitude
for
this
reason
when
he
sat
down
in
the
chair
he
drew
the
curtain
a
little
forwards
and
having
a
tear
at
every
one
service
he
pull
out
a
cambrick
handkerchief
gave
a
low
sigh
but
held
his
peace
chapter
is
not
gain
that
is
got
into
the
purse
so
that
notwithstanding
my
father
had
the
happiness
of
reading
the
oddest
books
in
the
universe
and
had
moreover
in
himself
the
oddest
way
of
thinking
that
ever
man
in
it
was
bless
with
yet
it
had
this
drawback
upon
him
after
all
that
it
laid
him
open
to
some
of
the
oddest
and
most
whimsical
distresses
of
which
this
particular
one
which
he
sunk
under
at
present
is
as
strong
an
example
as
can
be
given
no
doubt
the
breaking
down
of
the
bridge
of
a
child
nose
by
the
edge
of
a
pair
of
forceps
however
scientifically
applied
would
vex
any
man
in
the
world
who
was
at
so
much
pains
in
begetting
a
child
as
my
father
was
yet
it
will
not
account
for
the
extravagance
of
his
affliction
nor
will
it
justify
the
manner
he
abandoned
and
surrendered
himself
up
to
to
explain
this
i
must
leave
him
upon
the
bed
for
half
an
hour
and
my
uncle
toby
in
his
old
fringed
chair
sitting
beside
him
chapter
i
think
it
a
very
unreasonable
demand
cried
my
twisting
up
the
paper
and
throwing
it
upon
the
by
this
account
madam
you
have
but
two
thousand
pounds
fortune
and
not
a
shilling
more
and
you
insist
upon
having
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
jointure
for
replied
my
have
little
or
no
nose
sir
now
before
i
venture
to
make
use
of
the
word
nose
a
second
time
to
avoid
all
confusion
in
what
will
be
said
upon
it
in
this
interesting
part
of
my
story
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
explain
my
own
meaning
and
define
with
all
possible
exactness
and
precision
what
i
would
willingly
be
understood
to
mean
by
the
term
being
of
opinion
that
is
owing
to
the
negligence
and
perverseness
of
writers
in
despising
this
precaution
and
to
nothing
else
that
all
the
polemical
writings
in
divinity
are
not
as
clear
and
demonstrative
as
those
upon
a
will
o
the
wisp
or
any
other
sound
part
of
philosophy
and
natural
pursuit
in
order
to
which
what
have
you
to
do
before
you
set
out
unless
you
intend
to
go
puzzling
on
to
the
day
of
judgment
but
to
give
the
world
a
good
definition
and
stand
to
it
of
the
main
word
you
have
most
occasion
for
changing
it
sir
as
you
would
a
guinea
into
small
coin
which
done
let
the
father
of
confusion
puzzle
you
if
he
can
or
put
a
different
idea
either
into
your
head
or
your
reader
head
if
he
knows
how
in
books
of
strict
morality
and
close
reasoning
such
as
i
am
engaged
in
the
neglect
is
inexcusable
and
heaven
is
witness
how
the
world
has
revenged
itself
upon
me
for
leaving

stepping

laying

i
triumph
over
him
as
i
always
do
like

is
my
comfort
however
i
am
not
an
obstinate
one
therefore
i
define
a
nose
as
follows
intreating
only
beforehand
and
beseeching
my
readers
both
male
and
female
of
what
age
complexion
and
condition
soever
for
the
love
of
god
and
their
own
souls
to
guard
against
the
temptations

suggestions
of
the
devil
and
suffer
him
by
no
art
or
wile
to
put
any
other
ideas
into
their
minds
than
what
i
put
into
my
definition
for
by
the
word
nose
throughout
all
this
long
chapter
of
noses
and
in
every
other
part
of
my
work
where
the
word
nose
occurs
i
declare
by
that
word
i
mean
a
nose
and
nothing
more
or
less
chapter
quoth
my
great
grandmother
repeating
the
words
again
have
little
or
no
nose
sir
cried
my
clapping
his
hand
upon
his
nose
is
not
so
small
as
that
comes
to
is
a
full
inch
longer
than
my
now
my
nose
was
for
all
the
world
like
unto
the
noses
of
all
the
men
women
and
children
whom
pantagruel
found
dwelling
upon
the
island
of
by
the
way
if
you
would
know
the
strange
way
of
getting
amongst
so
a
people
you
must
read
the
book
find
it
out
yourself
you
never
was
shaped
sir
like
an
ace
of
clubs
is
a
full
inch
continued
my
grandfather
pressing
up
the
ridge
of
his
nose
with
his
finger
and
thumb
and
repeating
his
assertion
is
a
full
inch
longer
madam
than
my
father
you
must
mean
your
uncle
replied
my
my

he
untwisted
the
paper
and
signed
the
article
chapter
what
an
unconscionable
jointure
my
dear
do
we
pay
out
of
this
small
estate
of
ours
quoth
my
grandmother
to
my
grandfather
my
father
replied
my
grandfather
had
no
more
nose
my
dear
saving
the
mark
than
there
is
upon
the
back
of
my
hand
now
you
must
know
that
my
outlived
my
grandfather
twelve
years
so
that
my
father
had
the
jointure
to
pay
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
on
michaelmas
and
during
all
that
time
no
man
discharged
pecuniary
obligations
with
a
better
grace
than
my
and
as
far
as
a
hundred
pounds
went
he
would
fling
it
upon
the
table
guinea
by
guinea
with
that
spirited
jerk
of
an
honest
welcome
which
generous
souls
and
generous
souls
only
are
able
to
fling
down
money
but
as
soon
as
ever
he
enter
upon
the
odd
fifty
he
generally
gave
a
loud
hem
rubb
the
side
of
his
nose
leisurely
with
the
flat
part
of
his
fore
finger
inserted
his
hand
cautiously
betwixt
his
head
and
the
cawl
of
his
wig
look
at
both
sides
of
every
guinea
as
he
parted
with
it
and
seldom
could
get
to
the
end
of
the
fifty
pounds
without
pulling
out
his
handkerchief
and
wiping
his
temples
defend
me
gracious
heaven
from
those
persecuting
spirits
who
make
no
allowances
for
these
workings
within
never
o
never
may
i
lay
down
in
their
tents
who
can
not
relax
the
engine
and
feel
pity
for
the
force
of
education
and
the
prevalence
of
opinions
long
derived
from
ancestors
for
three
generations
at
least
this
tenet
in
favour
of
long
noses
had
gradually
been
taking
root
in
our
tradition
was
all
along
on
its
side
and
interest
was
every
stepping
in
to
strengthen
it
so
that
the
whimsicality
of
my
father
brain
was
far
from
having
the
whole
honour
of
this
as
it
had
of
almost
all
his
other
strange
for
in
a
great
measure
he
might
be
said
to
have
suck
this
in
with
his
mother
milk
he
did
his
part
if
education
planted
the
mistake
in
case
it
was
one
my
father
watered
it
and
ripened
it
to
perfection
he
would
often
declare
in
speaking
his
thoughts
upon
the
subject
that
he
did
not
conceive
how
the
greatest
family
in
england
could
stand
it
out
against
an
uninterrupted
succession
of
six
or
seven
short
and
for
the
contrary
reason
he
would
generally
add
that
it
must
be
one
of
the
greatest
problems
in
civil
life
where
the
same
number
of
long
and
jolly
noses
following
one
another
in
a
direct
line
did
not
raise
and
hoist
it
up
into
the
best
vacancies
in
the
he
would
often
boast
that
the
shandy
family
rank
very
high
in
king
harry
the
viiith
time
but
owed
its
rise
to
no
state
engine
he
would
say
but
to
that
only
but
that
like
other
families
he
would
add
it
had
felt
the
turn
of
the
wheel
and
had
never
recovered
the
blow
of
my
it
was
an
ace
of
clubs
indeed
he
would
cry
shaking
his
head
and
as
vile
a
one
for
an
unfortunate
family
as
ever
turn
up
trumps
fair
and
softly
gentle
reader
where
is
thy
fancy
carrying
thee
if
there
is
truth
in
man
by
my
nose
i
mean
the
external
organ
of
smelling
or
that
part
of
man
which
stands
prominent
in
his
face
and
which
painters
say
in
good
jolly
noses
and
faces
should
comprehend
a
full
third
that
is
measured
downwards
from
the
setting
on
of
the
hair
what
a
life
of
it
has
an
author
at
this
pass
chapter
it
is
a
singular
blessing
that
nature
has
form
the
mind
of
man
with
the
same
happy
backwardness
and
renitency
against
conviction
which
is
observed
in
old
dogs
not
learning
new
tricks
what
a
shuttlecock
of
a
fellow
would
the
greatest
philosopher
that
ever
existed
be
whisk
into
at
once
did
he
read
such
books
and
observe
such
facts
and
think
such
thoughts
as
would
eternally
be
making
him
change
sides
now
my
father
as
i
told
you
last
year
detested
all
this
he
up
an
opinion
sir
as
a
man
in
a
state
of
nature
picks
up
an
it
becomes
his
own
and
if
he
is
a
man
of
spirit
he
would
lose
his
life
rather
than
give
it
up
i
am
aware
that
didius
the
great
civilian
will
contest
this
point
and
cry
out
against
me
whence
comes
this
man
right
to
this
apple
ex
confesso
he
will
say
things
were
in
a
state
of
nature
the
apple
is
as
much
frank
apple
as
john
pray
shandy
what
patent
has
he
to
shew
for
it
and
how
did
it
begin
to
be
his
was
it
when
he
set
his
heart
upon
it
or
when
he
gathered
it
or
when
he
chew
it
or
when
he
roasted
it
or
when
he
peel
or
when
he
brought
it
home
or
when
he
digested
or
when
he
for
is
plain
sir
if
the
first
picking
up
of
the
apple
made
it
not
his
that
no
subsequent
act
could
brother
didius
tribonius
will
answer
now
tribonius
the
civilian
and
church
lawyer
beard
being
three
inches
and
a
half
and
three
eighths
longer
than
didius
his
beard
i
glad
he
takes
up
the
cudgels
for
me
so
i
give
myself
no
farther
trouble
about
the
answer
brother
didius
tribonius
will
say
it
is
a
decreed
case
as
you
may
find
it
in
the
fragments
of
gregorius
and
hermogines
codes
and
in
all
the
codes
from
justinian
down
to
the
codes
of
louis
and
des
eaux
that
the
sweat
of
a
man
brows
and
the
exsudations
of
a
man
brains
are
as
much
a
own
property
as
the
breeches
upon
his
backside
which
said
exsudations
being
dropp
upon
the
said
apple
by
the
labour
of
finding
it
and
picking
it
up
and
being
moreover
indissolubly
wasted
and
as
indissolubly
annex
by
the
picker
up
to
the
thing
pick
up
carried
home
roasted
peel
eaten
digested
and
so
on
is
evident
that
the
gatherer
of
the
apple
in
so
doing
has
mix
up
something
which
was
his
own
with
the
apple
which
was
not
his
own
by
which
means
he
has
acquired
a
property
or
in
other
words
the
apple
is
john
apple
by
the
same
learned
chain
of
reasoning
my
father
stood
up
for
all
his
opinions
he
had
spared
no
pains
in
picking
them
up
and
the
more
they
lay
out
of
the
common
way
the
better
still
was
his
no
mortal
claimed
them
they
had
cost
him
moreover
as
much
labour
in
cooking
and
digesting
as
in
the
case
above
so
that
they
might
well
and
truly
be
said
to
be
of
his
own
goods
and
accordingly
he
held
fast
by
both
by
teeth
and
claws
would
fly
to
whatever
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
and
in
a
word
would
intrench
and
fortify
them
round
with
as
many
circumvallations
and
as
my
uncle
toby
would
a
citadel

was
one
plaguy

the
way
of
this
the
scarcity
of
materials
to
make
any
thing
of
a
defence
with
in
case
of
a
smart
attack
inasmuch
as
few
men
of
great
genius
had
exercised
their
parts
in
writing
books
upon
the
subject
of
great
noses
by
the
trotting
of
my
lean
horse
the
thing
is
incredible
and
i
am
quite
lost
in
my
understanding
when
i
am
considering
what
a
treasure
of
precious
time
and
talents
together
has
been
wasted
upon
worse
subjects
and
how
many
millions
of
books
in
all
languages
and
in
all
possible
types
and
bindings
have
been
fabricated
upon
points
not
half
so
much
tending
to
the
unity
and
of
the
world

was
to
be

however

set
the
greater

though
my
father
would
sport
with

uncle

was
ridiculous
enough
yet
at
the
very
same
time
he
did
it
he
collected
every
book

which
had
been
systematically
wrote
upon
noses
with
as
much
care
as
my
honest
uncle

had
done

rather

it

my

collection
was
not
great
but
to
make
amends
it
was
curious
and
consequently
he
was
some
time
in
making
it
he
had
the
great
good
fortune
hewever
to
set
off
well
in
getting
prologue
upon
long
noses
almost
for
nothing
for
he
gave
no
more
for
bruscambille
than
three

strong
fancy

bruscambille
is

might
easily
be
done

no
objection
against
the
simile
to
say

that

is

so
that

should

slawkenbergius
has
been
dead
and
laid
in
his
grave
above
fourscore
and
ten
years
we
can
only
raise
conjectures
slawkenbergius
was
play
upon
for
aught
i
know
like
one
of
whitefield
disciples
that
is
with
such
a
distinct
intelligence
sir
of
which
of
the
two
masters
it
was
that
had
been
practising
upon
his
instrument
as
to
make
all
reasoning
upon
it
needless
for
in
the
account
which
hafen
slawkenbergius
gives
the
world
of
his
motives
and
occasions
for
writing
and
spending
so
many
years
of
his
life
upon
this
one
work
towards
the
end
of
his
prolegomena
which
should
have
come
first
but
the
bookbinder
has
most
injudiciously
placed
it
betwixt
the
analytical
contents
of
the
book
and
the
book
itself
he
informs
his
reader
that
ever
since
he
had
arrived
at
the
age
of
discernment
and
was
able
to
sit
down
cooly
and
consider
within
himself
the
true
state
and
condition
of
man
and
distinguish
the
main
end
and
design
of
his
being
or
to
shorten
my
translation
for
slawkenbergius
book
is
in
latin
and
not
a
little
prolix
in
this
passage
ever
since
i
understood
quoth
slawkenbergius
any
thing
or
rather
what
was
what
and
could
perceive
that
the
point
of
long
noses
had
been
too
loosely
handled
by
all
who
had
gone
before
have
i
slawkenbergius
felt
a
strong
impulse
with
a
mighty
and
unresistible
call
within
me
to
gird
up
myself
to
this
undertaking
and
to
do
justice
to
slawkenbergius
he
has
entered
the
list
with
a
stronger
lance
and
taken
a
much
larger
career
in
it
than
any
one
man
who
had
ever
entered
it
before
him
and
indeed
in
many
respects
deserves
to
be
as
a
prototype
for
all
writers
of
voluminous
works
at
least
to
model
their
books
by
for
he
has
taken
in
sir
the
whole
subject
examined
every
part
of
it
dialectically
then
brought
it
into
full
day
dilucidating
it
with
all
the
light
which
either
the
collision
of
his
own
natural
parts
could
strike
or
the
profoundest
knowledge
of
the
sciences
had
impowered
him
to
cast
upon
it
collating
collecting
and
compiling
begging
borrowing
and
stealing
as
he
went
along
all
that
had
been
wrote
or
wrangled
thereupon
in
the
schools
and
porticos
of
the
learned
so
that
slawkenbergius
his
book
may
properly
be
considered
not
only
as
a
model
but
as
a
digest
and
regular
institute
of
noses
comprehending
in
it
all
that
is
or
can
be
needful
to
be
known
about
them
for
this
cause
it
is
that
i
forbear
to
speak
of
so
many
otherwise
valuable
books
and
treatises
of
my
father
collecting
wrote
either
plump
upon
noses
or
collaterally
touching
them
such
for
instance
as
prignitz
now
lying
upon
the
table
before
me
who
with
infinite
learning
and
from
the
most
candid
and
examination
of
above
four
thousand
different
skulls
in
upwards
of
twenty
in
silesia
which
he
had
rummaged
has
informed
us
that
the
mensuration
and
configuration
of
the
osseous
or
bony
parts
of
human
noses
in
any
given
tract
of
country
except
crim
tartary
where
they
are
all
down
by
the
thumb
so
that
no
judgment
can
be
formed
upon
them
are
much
nearer
alike
than
the
world
imagines
the
difference
amongst
them
being
he
says
a
mere
trifle
not
worth
taking
notice
of
but
that
the
size
and
jollity
of
every
individual
nose
and
by
which
one
nose
ranks
above
another
and
bears
a
higher
price
is
owing
to
the
cartilaginous
and
muscular
parts
of
it
into
whose
ducts
and
sinuses
the
blood
and
animal
spirits
being
impell
and
driven
by
the
warmth
and
force
of
the
imagination
which
is
but
a
step
from
it
bating
the
case
of
idiots
whom
prignitz
who
had
lived
many
years
in
turky
supposes
under
the
more
immediate
tutelage
of
heaven
it
so
happens
and
ever
must
says
prignitz
that
the
excellency
of
the
nose
is
in
a
direct
arithmetical
proportion
to
the
excellency
of
the
wearer
fancy
it
is
for
the
same
reason
that
is
because
is
all
comprehended
in
slawkenbergius
that
i
say
nothing
likewise
of
scroderus
andrea
who
all
the
world
knows
set
himself
to
oppugn
prignitz
with
great
violence
proving
it
in
his
own
way
first
logically
and
then
by
a
series
of
stubborn
facts
so
far
was
prignitz
from
the
truth
in
affirming
that
the
fancy
begat
the
nose
that
on
the
contrary
the
nose
begat
the
fancy
the
learned
suspected
scroderus
of
an
indecent
sophism
in
this
and
prignitz
cried
out
aloud
in
the
dispute
that
scroderus
had
shifted
the
idea
upon
him
but
scroderus
went
on
maintaining
his
thesis
my
father
was
just
balancing
within
himself
which
of
the
two
sides
he
should
take
in
this
affair
when
ambrose
paraeus
decided
it
in
a
moment
and
by
overthrowing
the
systems
both
of
prignitz
and
scroderus
drove
my
father
out
of
both
sides
of
the
controversy
at
once
be
witness
i
do
acquaint
the
learned
reader
in
saying
it
i
mention
it
only
to
shew
the
learned
i
know
the
fact
myself
that
this
ambrose
paraeus
was
chief
surgeon
and
to
francis
the
ninth
of
france
and
in
high
credit
with
him
and
the
two
preceding
or
succeeding
kings
i
know
not
which
and
that
except
in
the
slip
he
made
in
his
story
of
taliacotius
noses
and
his
manner
of
setting
them
on
he
was
esteemed
by
the
whole
college
of
physicians
at
that
time
as
more
knowing
in
matters
of
noses
than
any
one
who
had
ever
taken
them
in
hand
now
ambrose
paraeus
convinced
my
father
that
the
true
and
efficient
cause
of
what
had
engaged
so
much
the
attention
of
the
world
and
upon
which
prignitz
and
scroderus
had
wasted
so
much
learning
and
fine
parts
was
neither
this
nor
that
but
that
the
length
and
goodness
of
the
nose
was
owing
simply
to
the
softness
and
flaccidity
in
the
breast
as
the
flatness
and
shortness
of
puisne
noses
was
to
the
firmness
and
elastic
repulsion
of
the
same
organ
of
nutrition
in
the
hale
and
lively
which
tho
happy
for
the
woman
was
the
undoing
of
the
child
inasmuch
as
his
nose
was
so
snubb
so
rebuff
so
rebated
and
so
refrigerated
thereby
as
never
to
arrive
ad
mensuram
suam
legitimam
but
that
in
case
of
the
flaccidity
and
softness
of
the
nurse
or
mother
breast
by
sinking
into
it
quoth
paraeus
as
into
so
much
butter
the
nose
was
comforted
nourish
plump
up
refresh
refocillated
and
set
a
growing
for
ever
i
have
but
two
things
to
observe
of
paraeus
first
that
he
proves
and
explains
all
this
with
the
utmost
chastity
and
decorum
of
expression
for
which
may
his
soul
for
ever
rest
in
peace
and
secondly
that
besides
the
systems
of
prignitz
and
scroderus
which
ambrose
paraeus
his
hypothesis
effectually
overthrew
it
overthrew
at
the
same
time
the
system
of
peace
and
harmony
of
our
family
and
for
three
days
together
not
only
embroiled
matters
between
my
father
and
my
mother
but
turn
likewise
the
whole
house
and
every
thing
in
it
except
my
uncle
toby
quite
upside
down
such
a
ridiculous
tale
of
a
dispute
between
a
man
and
his
wife
never
surely
in
any
age
or
country
got
vent
through
the
of
a
my
mother
you
must
know
but
i
have
fifty
things
more
necessary
to
let
you
know
first
i
have
a
hundred
difficulties
which
i
have
promised
to
clear
up
and
a
thousand
distresses
and
domestick
misadventures
crowding
in
upon
me
thick
and
threefold
one
upon
the
neck
of
another
a
cow
broke
in
tomorrow
morning
to
my
uncle
toby
fortifications
and
eat
up
two
rations
and
a
half
of
dried
grass
tearing
up
the
sods
with
it
which
faced
his
and
covered
trim
insists
upon
being
tried
by
a
the
cow
to
be
shot
slop
to
be
crucifix
myself
to
be
tristram
and
at
my
very
baptism
made
a
martyr
of
poor
unhappy
devils
that
we
all
are
i
want
swaddling
but
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
in
exclamations
i
have
left
my
father
lying
across
his
bed
and
my
uncle
toby
in
his
old
fringed
chair
sitting
beside
him
and
promised
i
would
go
back
to
them
in
half
an
hour
and
minutes
are
laps
of
all
the
perplexities
a
mortal
author
was
ever
seen
in
this
certainly
is
the
greatest
for
i
have
hafen
slawkenbergius
folio
sir
to
finish
a
dialogue
between
my
father
and
my
uncle
toby
upon
the
solution
of
prignitz
scroderus
ambrose
paraeus
panocrates
and
grangousier
to
relate
a
tale
out
of
slawkenbergius
to
translate
and
all
this
in
five
minutes
less
than
no
time
at
all
such
a
head
would
to
heaven
my
enemies
only
saw
the
inside
of
it
chapter
there
was
not
any
one
scene
more
entertaining
in
our
family
and
to
do
it
justice
in
this
point
and
i
here
put
off
my
cap
and
lay
it
upon
the
table
close
beside
my
on
purpose
to
make
my
declaration
to
the
world
concerning
this
one
article
the
more
solemn
that
i
believe
in
my
soul
unless
my
love
and
partiality
to
my
understanding
blinds
me
the
hand
of
the
supreme
maker
and
first
designer
of
all
things
never
made
or
put
a
family
together
in
that
period
at
least
of
it
which
i
have
sat
down
to
write
the
story
of
where
the
characters
of
it
were
cast
or
contrasted
with
so
dramatick
a
felicity
as
ours
was
for
this
end
or
in
which
the
capacities
of
affording
such
exquisite
scenes
and
the
powers
of
shifting
them
perpetually
from
morning
to
night
were
lodged
and
intrusted
with
so
unlimited
a
confidence
as
in
the
shandy
family
not
any
one
of
these
was
more
diverting
i
say
in
this
whimsical
theatre
of
ours
than
what
frequently
arose
out
of
this
chapter
of
long
noses
especially
when
my
father
imagination
was
heated
with
the
enquiry
and
nothing
would
serve
him
but
to
heat
my
uncle
toby
too
my
uncle
toby
would
give
my
father
all
possible
fair
play
in
this
attempt
and
with
infinite
patience
would
sit
smoking
his
pipe
for
whole
hours
together
whilst
my
father
was
practising
upon
his
head
and
trying
every
accessible
avenue
to
drive
prignitz
and
solutions
into
it
whether
they
were
above
my
uncle
toby
reason
or
contrary
to
it
or
that
his
brain
was
like
damp
timber
and
no
spark
could
possibly
take
hold
or
that
it
was
so
full
of
saps
mines
blinds
curtins
and
such
military
disqualifications
to
his
seeing
clearly
into
prignitz
and
scroderus
doctrines
i
say
not
let
schoolmen
scullions
anatomists
and
engineers
fight
for
it
among
themselves
some
misfortune
i
make
no
doubt
in
this
affair
that
my
father
had
every
word
of
it
to
translate
for
the
benefit
of
my
uncle
toby
and
render
out
of
slawkenbergius
latin
of
which
as
he
was
no
great
master
his
translation
was
not
always
of
the
purest
and
generally
least
so
where
was
most
this
naturally
open
a
door
to
a
second
misfortune
that
in
the
warmer
paroxysms
of
his
zeal
to
open
my
uncle
toby
eyes
my
father
ideas
ran
on
as
much
faster
than
the
translation
as
the
translation
outmoved
my
uncle
toby
neither
the
one
or
the
other
added
much
to
the
perspicuity
of
my
father
lecture
chapter
the
gift
of
ratiocination
and
making
syllogisms
i
mean
in
man
for
in
superior
classes
of
being
such
as
angels
and
spirits
is
all
done
may
it
please
your
worships
as
they
tell
me
by
intuition
and
beings
inferior
as
your
worships
all
know
syllogize
by
their
noses
though
there
is
an
island
swimming
in
the
sea
though
not
altogether
at
its
ease
whose
inhabitants
if
my
intelligence
deceives
me
not
are
so
wonderfully
gifted
as
to
syllogize
after
the
same
fashion
and
to
make
very
well
out
too
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
the
gift
of
doing
it
as
it
should
be
amongst
us
or
the
great
and
principal
act
of
ratiocination
in
man
as
logicians
tell
us
is
the
finding
out
the
agreement
or
disagreement
of
two
ideas
one
with
another
by
the
intervention
of
a
third
called
the
medius
terminus
just
as
a
man
as
locke
well
observes
by
a
yard
finds
two
mens
to
be
of
the
same
length
which
could
not
be
brought
together
to
measure
their
equality
by
had
the
same
great
reasoner
looked
on
as
my
father
illustrated
his
systems
of
noses
and
observed
my
uncle
toby
deportment
what
great
attention
he
gave
to
every
word
and
as
oft
as
he
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
with
what
wonderful
seriousness
he
contemplated
the
length
of
it
surveying
it
transversely
as
he
held
it
betwixt
his
finger
and
his
thumb
then
then
this
way
and
then
that
in
all
its
possible
directions
and
he
would
have
concluded
my
uncle
toby
had
got
hold
of
the
medius
terminus
and
was
syllogizing
and
measuring
with
it
the
truth
of
each
hypothesis
of
long
noses
in
order
as
my
father
laid
them
before
him
this
was
more
than
my
father
wanted
his
aim
in
all
the
pains
he
was
at
in
these
philosophick
lectures
was
to
enable
my
uncle
toby
not
to
discuss
but
comprehend
to
hold
the
grains
and
scruples
of
learning
not
to
weigh
my
uncle
toby
as
you
will
read
in
the
next
chapter
did
neither
the
one
or
the
other
chapter
is
a
pity
cried
my
father
one
winter
night
after
a
three
hours
painful
translation
of
slawkenbergius
is
a
pity
cried
my
father
putting
my
mother
threadpaper
into
the
book
for
a
mark
as
he
spoke
that
truth
brother
toby
should
shut
herself
up
in
such
impregnable
fastnesses
and
be
so
obstinate
as
not
to
surrender
herself
sometimes
up
upon
the
closest
now
it
happened
then
as
indeed
it
had
often
done
before
that
my
uncle
toby
fancy
during
the
time
of
my
father
explanation
of
prignitz
to
him
having
nothing
to
stay
it
there
had
taken
a
short
flight
to
the
his
body
might
as
well
have
taken
a
turn
there
too
so
that
with
all
the
semblance
of
a
deep
intent
upon
the
medius
terminus
my
uncle
toby
was
in
fact
as
ignorant
of
the
whole
lecture
and
all
its
pros
and
cons
as
if
my
father
had
been
translating
hafen
slawkenbergius
from
the
latin
tongue
into
the
cherokee
but
the
word
siege
like
a
talismanic
power
in
my
father
metaphor
wafting
back
my
uncle
toby
fancy
quick
as
a
note
could
follow
the
touch
he
his
ears
and
my
father
observing
that
he
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
shuffled
his
chair
nearer
the
table
as
with
a
desire
to
profit
my
father
with
great
pleasure
began
his
sentence
again
changing
only
the
plan
and
dropping
the
metaphor
of
the
siege
of
it
to
keep
clear
of
some
dangers
my
father
apprehended
from
it
is
a
pity
said
my
father
that
truth
can
only
be
on
one
side
brother
toby
considering
what
ingenuity
these
learned
men
have
all
shewn
in
their
solutions
of
can
noses
be
dissolved
replied
my
uncle
toby
my
father
thrust
back
his
chair
rose
up
put
on
his
hat
took
four
long
strides
to
the
door
jerked
it
open
thrust
his
head
half
way
out
shut
the
door
again
took
no
notice
of
the
bad
hinge
returned
to
the
table
pluck
my
mother
out
of
book
went
hastily
to
his
bureau
walked
slowly
back
twisted
my
mother
about
his
thumb
unbutton
his
waistcoat
threw
my
mother
into
the
fire
bit
her
sattin
in
two
fill
his
mouth
with
bran
confounded
it
but
mark
the
oath
of
confusion
was
levell
at
my
uncle
toby
brain
which
was
confused
enough
already
the
curse
came
charged
only
with
the
bran
the
bran
may
it
please
your
honours
was
no
more
than
powder
to
the
ball
was
well
my
father
passions
lasted
not
long
for
so
long
as
they
did
last
they
led
him
a
busy
life
o
and
it
is
one
of
the
most
unaccountable
problems
that
ever
i
met
with
in
my
observations
of
human
nature
that
nothing
should
prove
my
father
mettle
so
much
or
make
his
passions
go
off
so
like
as
the
unexpected
strokes
his
science
met
with
from
the
quaint
simplicity
of
my
uncle
had
ten
dozen
of
hornets
stung
him
behind
in
so
many
different
places
all
at
one
time
he
could
not
have
exerted
more
mechanical
functions
in
fewer
seconds
or
started
half
so
much
as
with
one
single
quaere
of
three
words
unseasonably
popping
in
full
upon
him
in
his
career
was
all
one
to
my
uncle
toby
he
smoked
his
pipe
on
with
unvaried
composure
his
heart
never
intended
offence
to
his
brother
and
as
his
head
could
seldom
find
out
where
the
sting
of
it
lay
he
always
gave
my
father
the
credit
of
cooling
by
he
was
five
minutes
and
seconds
about
it
in
the
present
case
by
all
that
good
said
my
father
swearing
as
he
came
to
himself
and
taking
the
oath
out
of
ernulphus
digest
of
curses
though
to
do
my
father
justice
it
was
a
fault
as
he
told
slop
in
the
affair
of
ernulphus
which
he
as
seldom
committed
as
any
man
upon
earth
by
all
that
good
and
great
brother
toby
said
my
father
if
it
was
not
for
the
aids
of
philosophy
which
befriend
one
so
much
as
they
do
you
would
put
a
man
beside
all
why
by
the
solutions
of
noses
of
which
i
was
telling
you
i
meant
as
you
might
have
known
had
you
favoured
me
with
one
grain
of
attention
the
various
accounts
which
learned
men
of
different
kinds
of
knowledge
have
given
the
world
of
the
causes
of
short
and
long
there
is
no
cause
but
one
replied
my
uncle
toby
why
one
man
nose
is
longer
than
another
but
because
that
god
pleases
to
have
it
that
is
grangousier
solution
said
my
is
he
continued
my
uncle
toby
looking
up
and
not
regarding
my
interruption
who
makes
us
all
and
frames
and
puts
us
together
in
such
forms
and
proportions
and
for
such
ends
as
is
agreeable
to
his
infinite
wisdom
is
a
pious
account
cried
my
father
but
not
philosophical
there
is
more
religion
in
it
than
sound
science
was
no
inconsistent
part
of
my
uncle
toby
character
that
he
feared
god
and
reverenced
so
the
moment
my
father
finished
his
remark
my
uncle
toby
fell
a
whistling
lillabullero
with
more
zeal
though
more
out
of
tune
than
what
is
become
of
my
wife
chapter
no
matter
as
an
appendage
to
seamstressy
the
might
be
of
some
consequence
to
my
mother
of
none
to
my
father
as
a
mark
in
slawkenbergius
slawkenbergius
in
every
page
of
him
was
a
rich
treasure
of
inexhaustible
knowledge
to
my
father
he
could
not
open
him
amiss
and
he
would
often
say
in
closing
the
book
that
if
all
the
arts
and
sciences
in
the
world
with
the
books
which
treated
of
them
were
lost
should
the
wisdom
and
policies
of
governments
he
would
say
through
disuse
ever
happen
to
be
forgot
and
all
that
statesmen
had
wrote
or
caused
to
be
written
upon
the
strong
or
the
weak
sides
of
courts
and
kingdoms
should
they
be
forgot
also
and
slawkenbergius
only
left
there
would
be
enough
in
him
in
all
conscience
he
would
say
to
set
the
world
again
a
treasure
therefore
was
he
indeed
an
institute
of
all
that
was
necessary
to
be
known
of
noses
and
every
thing
else
at
matin
noon
and
vespers
was
hafen
slawkenbergius
his
recreation
and
delight
was
for
ever
in
his
hands
you
would
have
sworn
sir
it
had
been
a
canon
so
worn
so
glazed
so
contrited
and
attrited
was
it
with
fingers
and
with
thumbs
in
all
its
parts
from
one
end
even
unto
the
other
i
am
not
such
a
bigot
to
slawkenbergius
as
my
father
there
is
a
fund
in
him
no
doubt
but
in
my
opinion
the
best
i
do
say
the
most
profitable
but
the
most
amusing
part
of
hafen
slawkenbergius
is
his
tales
and
considering
he
was
a
german
many
of
them
told
not
without
fancy
these
take
up
his
second
book
containing
nearly
one
half
of
his
folio
and
are
comprehended
in
ten
decads
each
decad
containing
ten
tales
philosophy
is
not
built
upon
tales
and
therefore
was
certainly
wrong
in
slawkenbergius
to
send
them
into
the
world
by
that
name
there
are
a
few
of
them
in
his
eighth
ninth
and
tenth
decads
which
i
own
seem
rather
playful
and
sportive
than
speculative
but
in
general
they
are
to
be
looked
upon
by
the
learned
as
a
detail
of
so
many
independent
facts
all
of
them
turning
round
somehow
or
other
upon
the
main
hinges
of
his
subject
and
added
to
his
work
as
so
many
illustrations
upon
the
doctrines
of
noses
as
we
have
leisure
enough
upon
our
hands
if
you
give
me
leave
madam
i
tell
you
the
ninth
tale
of
his
tenth
decad
slawkenbergii
fabella
as
hafen
slawkenbergius
de
nasis
is
extremely
scarce
it
may
not
be
unacceptable
to
the
learned
reader
to
see
the
specimen
of
a
few
pages
of
his
original
i
will
make
no
reflection
upon
it
but
that
his
latin
is
much
more
concise
than
his
philosophic
and
i
think
has
more
of
latinity
in
it

tale
it
was
one
cool
refreshing
evening
at
the
close
of
a
very
sultry
day
in
the
latter
end
of
the
month
of
august
when
a
stranger
mounted
upon
a
dark
mule
with
a
small
behind
him
containing
a
few
shirts
a
pair
of
shoes
and
a
pair
of
breeches
entered
the
town
of
strasburg
he
told
the
centinel
who
questioned
him
as
he
entered
the
gates
that
he
had
been
at
the
promontory
of
noses
was
going
on
to
frankfort
and
should
be
back
again
at
strasburg
that
day
month
in
his
way
to
the
borders
of
crim
tartary
the
centinel
looked
up
into
the
stranger
face
he
never
saw
such
a
nose
in
his
life
i
have
made
a
very
good
venture
of
it
quoth
the
stranger
so
slipping
his
wrist
out
of
the
loop
of
a
black
ribbon
to
which
a
short
scymetar
was
hung
he
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
with
great
courtesy
touching
the
fore
part
of
his
cap
with
his
left
hand
as
he
extended
his
right
he
put
a
florin
into
the
centinel
hand
and
passed
on
it
grieves
me
said
the
centinel
speaking
to
a
little
dwarfish
drummer
that
so
courteous
a
soul
should
have
lost
his
scabbard
he
can
not
travel
without
one
to
his
scymetar
and
will
not
be
able
to
get
a
scabbard
to
fit
it
in
all
i
never
had
one
replied
the
stranger
looking
back
to
the
centinel
and
putting
his
hand
up
to
his
cap
as
he
spoke
i
carry
it
continued
he
thus
holding
up
his
naked
scymetar
his
mule
moving
on
slowly
all
the
time
on
purpose
to
defend
my
nose
it
is
well
worth
it
gentle
stranger
replied
the
centinel
is
not
worth
a
single
stiver
said
the
drummer
is
a
nose
of
parchment
as
i
am
a
true
catholic
except
that
it
is
six
times
as
big
is
a
nose
said
the
centinel
like
my
own
i
heard
it
crackle
said
the
drummer
by
dunder
said
the
centinel
i
saw
it
bleed
what
a
pity
cried
the
drummer
we
did
not
both
touch
it
at
the
very
time
that
this
dispute
was
maintaining
by
the
centinel
and
the
drummer
was
the
same
point
debating
betwixt
a
trumpeter
and
a
trumpeter
wife
who
were
just
then
coming
up
and
had
stopped
to
see
the
stranger
pass
by
benedicity
what
a
nose
is
as
long
said
the
trumpeter
wife
as
a
trumpet
and
of
the
same
metal
said
the
trumpeter
as
you
hear
by
its
sneezing
is
as
soft
as
a
flute
said
she
is
brass
said
the
trumpeter
is
a
pudding
end
said
his
wife
i
tell
thee
again
said
the
trumpeter
is
a
brazen
nose
i
know
the
bottom
of
it
said
the
trumpeter
wife
for
i
will
touch
it
with
my
finger
before
i
sleep
the
stranger
mule
moved
on
at
so
slow
a
rate
that
he
heard
every
word
of
the
dispute
not
only
betwixt
the
centinel
and
the
drummer
but
betwixt
the
trumpeter
and
trumpeter
wife
no
said
he
dropping
his
reins
upon
his
mule
neck
and
laying
both
his
hands
upon
his
breast
the
one
over
the
other
in
a
position
his
mule
going
on
easily
all
the
time
no
said
he
looking
up
i
am
not
such
a
debtor
to
the
world
slandered
and
disappointed
as
i
have
been
as
to
give
it
that
conviction
no
said
he
my
nose
shall
never
be
touched
whilst
heaven
gives
me
strength
to
do
what
said
a
burgomaster
wife
the
stranger
took
no
notice
of
the
burgomaster
wife
he
was
making
a
vow
to
saint
nicolas
which
done
having
uncrossed
his
arms
with
the
same
solemnity
with
which
he
crossed
them
he
took
up
the
reins
of
his
bridle
with
his
and
putting
his
right
hand
into
his
bosom
with
the
scymetar
hanging
loosely
to
the
wrist
of
it
he
rode
on
as
slowly
as
one
foot
of
the
mule
could
follow
another
thro
the
principal
streets
of
strasburg
till
chance
brought
him
to
the
great
inn
in
the
the
church
the
moment
the
stranger
alighted
he
ordered
his
mule
to
be
led
into
the
stable
and
his
to
be
brought
in
then
opening
and
taking
out
of
it
his
breeches
with
a
appendage
to
them
which
i
dare
not
translate
he
put
his
breeches
with
his
fringed
on
and
with
his
short
scymetar
in
his
hand
walked
out
to
the
grand
parade
the
stranger
had
just
taken
three
turns
upon
the
parade
when
he
perceived
the
trumpeter
wife
at
the
opposite
side
of
it
so
turning
short
in
pain
lest
his
nose
should
be
attempted
he
instantly
went
back
to
his
inn
undressed
himself
packed
up
his
breeches
in
his
and
called
for
his
mule
i
am
going
forwards
said
the
stranger
for
frankfort
and
shall
be
back
at
strasburg
this
day
month
i
hope
continued
the
stranger
stroking
down
the
face
of
his
mule
with
his
left
hand
as
he
was
going
to
mount
it
that
you
have
been
kind
to
this
faithful
slave
of
mine
it
has
carried
me
and
my
continued
he
tapping
the
mule
back
above
six
hundred
leagues
is
a
long
journey
sir
replied
the
master
of
the
inn
unless
a
man
has
great
tut
tut
said
the
stranger
i
have
been
at
the
promontory
of
noses
and
have
got
me
one
of
the
goodliest
thank
heaven
that
ever
fell
to
a
single
man
lot
whilst
the
stranger
was
giving
this
odd
account
of
himself
the
master
of
the
inn
and
his
wife
kept
both
their
eyes
fixed
full
upon
the
stranger
nose
by
saint
radagunda
said
the
wife
to
herself
there
is
more
of
it
than
in
any
dozen
of
the
largest
noses
put
together
in
all
strasburg
is
it
not
said
she
whispering
her
husband
in
his
ear
is
it
not
a
noble
nose
is
an
imposture
my
dear
said
the
master
of
the
inn
is
a
false
nose
is
a
true
nose
said
his
wife
is
made
of
said
he
i
smell
the
there
a
pimple
on
it
said
she
is
a
dead
nose
replied
the
is
a
live
nose
and
if
i
am
alive
myself
said
the
wife
i
will
touch
it
i
have
made
a
vow
to
saint
nicolas
this
day
said
the
stranger
that
my
nose
shall
not
be
touched
till
here
the
stranger
suspending
his
voice
looked
till
when
said
she
hastily
it
never
shall
be
touched
said
he
clasping
his
hands
and
bringing
them
close
to
his
breast
till
that
hour
what
hour
cried
the
inn
never
never
said
the
stranger
never
till
i
am
got
for
heaven
sake
into
what
place
said
she
the
stranger
rode
away
without
saying
a
word
the
stranger
had
not
got
half
a
league
on
his
way
towards
frankfort
before
all
the
city
of
strasburg
was
in
an
uproar
about
his
nose
the
compline
bells
were
just
ringing
to
call
the
strasburgers
to
their
devotions
and
shut
up
the
duties
of
the
day
in
prayer
no
soul
in
all
strasburg
heard
the
city
was
like
a
swarm
of
bees
men
women
and
children
the
compline
bells
tinkling
all
the
time
flying
here
and
there
in
at
one
door
out
at
another
this
way
and
that
way
long
ways
and
cross
ways
up
one
street
down
another
street
in
at
this
alley
out
of
that
did
you
see
it
did
you
see
it
did
you
see
it
o
did
you
see
it
who
saw
it
who
did
see
it
for
mercy
sake
who
saw
it
alack
i
was
at
vespers
i
was
washing
i
was
starching
i
was
scouring
i
was
quilting
god
help
me
i
never
saw
it
i
never
it
would
i
had
been
a
centinel
a
drummer
a
trumpeter
a
trumpeter
wife
was
the
general
cry
and
lamentation
in
every
street
and
corner
of
strasburg
whilst
all
this
confusion
and
disorder
triumphed
throughout
the
great
city
of
strasburg
was
the
courteous
stranger
going
on
as
gently
upon
his
mule
in
his
way
to
frankfort
as
if
he
had
no
concern
at
all
in
the
affair
talking
all
the
way
he
rode
in
broken
sentences
sometimes
to
his
mule
sometimes
to
himself
sometimes
to
his
julia
o
julia
my
lovely
julia
nay
i
can
not
stop
to
let
thee
bite
that
thistle
that
ever
the
suspected
tongue
of
a
rival
should
have
robbed
me
of
enjoyment
when
i
was
upon
the
point
of
tasting
pugh
is
nothing
but
a
thistle
never
mind
it
thou
shalt
have
a
better
supper
at
night
banish
from
my
country
my
friends
from
poor
devil
sadly
tired
with
thy
journey
come
get
on
a
little
faster
there
nothing
in
my
but
two
shirts
a
pair
of
breeches
and
a
fringed
dear
julia
but
why
to
frankfort
is
it
that
there
is
a
hand
unfelt
which
secretly
is
conducting
me
through
these
meanders
and
unsuspected
tracts
stumbling
by
saint
nicolas
every
step
why
at
this
rate
we
shall
be
all
night
in
getting
in
to
happiness
or
am
i
to
be
the
sport
of
fortune
and
slander
destined
to
be
driven
forth
unconvicted
unheard
untouch
if
so
why
did
i
not
stay
at
strasburg
where
justice
but
i
had
sworn
come
thou
shalt
drink
to
nicolas
o
julia
what
dost
thou
prick
up
thy
ears
at
is
nothing
but
a
man
the
stranger
rode
on
communing
in
this
manner
with
his
mule
and
julia
till
he
arrived
at
his
inn
where
as
soon
as
he
arrived
he
alighted
saw
his
mule
as
he
had
promised
it
taken
good
care
of
took
off
his
with
his
breeches
in
it
called
for
an
omelet
to
his
supper
went
to
his
bed
about
twelve
and
in
five
minutes
fell
fast
asleep
it
was
about
the
same
hour
when
the
tumult
in
strasburg
being
abated
for
that
night
the
strasburgers
had
all
got
quietly
into
their
beds
but
not
like
the
stranger
for
the
rest
either
of
their
minds
or
bodies
queen
mab
like
an
elf
as
she
was
had
taken
the
stranger
nose
and
without
reduction
of
its
bulk
had
that
night
been
at
the
pains
of
slitting
and
dividing
it
into
as
many
noses
of
different
cuts
and
fashions
as
there
were
heads
in
strasburg
to
hold
them
the
abbess
of
quedlingberg
who
with
the
four
great
dignitaries
of
her
chapter
the
prioress
the
deaness
the
and
senior
canonness
had
that
week
come
to
strasburg
to
consult
the
university
upon
a
case
of
conscience
relating
to
their
was
ill
all
the
night
the
courteous
stranger
nose
had
got
perched
upon
the
top
of
the
pineal
gland
of
her
brain
and
made
such
rousing
work
in
the
fancies
of
the
four
great
dignitaries
of
her
chapter
they
could
not
get
a
wink
of
sleep
the
whole
night
thro
for
it
there
was
no
keeping
a
limb
still
amongst
them
in
short
they
got
up
like
so
many
ghosts
the
penitentiaries
of
the
third
order
of
saint
francis
the
nuns
of
mount
calvary
the
praemonstratenses
the
clunienses
hafen
slawkenbergius
means
the
benedictine
nuns
of
cluny
founded
in
the
year
by
odo
abbe
de
cluny
the
carthusians
and
all
the
severer
orders
of
nuns
who
lay
that
night
in
blankets
or
were
still
in
a
worse
condition
than
the
abbess
of
quedlingberg
by
tumbling
and
tossing
and
tossing
and
tumbling
from
one
side
of
their
beds
to
the
other
the
whole
night
long
the
several
sisterhoods
had
scratch
and
maul
themselves
all
to
death
they
got
out
of
their
beds
almost
alive
every
body
thought
saint
antony
had
visited
them
for
probation
with
his
fire
they
had
never
once
in
short
shut
their
eyes
the
whole
night
long
from
vespers
to
matins
the
nuns
of
saint
ursula
acted
the
wisest
they
never
attempted
to
go
to
bed
at
all
the
dean
of
strasburg
the
prebendaries
the
capitulars
and
domiciliars
capitularly
assembled
in
the
morning
to
consider
the
case
of
buns
all
wished
they
had
followed
the
nuns
of
saint
ursula
in
the
hurry
and
confusion
every
thing
had
been
in
the
night
before
the
bakers
had
all
forgot
to
lay
their
leaven
there
were
no
buns
to
be
had
for
breakfast
in
all
strasburg
the
whole
close
of
the
cathedral
was
in
one
eternal
commotion
such
a
cause
of
restlessness
and
disquietude
and
such
a
zealous
inquiry
into
that
cause
of
the
restlessness
had
never
happened
in
strasburg
since
martin
luther
with
his
doctrines
had
turned
the
city
upside
down
if
the
stranger
nose
took
this
liberty
of
thrusting
himself
thus
into
the
dishes
shandy
compliments
to
orators
is
very
sensible
that
slawkenbergius
has
here
changed
his
metaphor
which
he
is
very
guilty
of
that
as
a
translator
shandy
has
all
along
done
what
he
could
to
make
him
stick
to
it
but
that
here
was
impossible
of
religious
orders
what
a
carnival
did
his
nose
make
of
it
in
those
of
the
laity
is
more
than
my
pen
worn
to
the
stump
as
it
is
has
power
to
describe
tho
i
acknowledge
cries
slawkenbergius
with
more
gaiety
of
thought
than
i
could
have
expected
from
him
that
there
is
many
a
good
simile
now
subsisting
in
the
world
which
might
give
my
countrymen
some
idea
of
it
but
at
the
close
of
such
a
folio
as
this
wrote
for
their
sakes
and
in
which
i
have
spent
the
greatest
part
of
my
life
tho
i
own
to
them
the
simile
is
in
being
yet
would
it
not
be
unreasonable
in
them
to
expect
i
should
have
either
time
or
inclination
to
search
for
it
let
it
suffice
to
say
that
the
riot
and
disorder
it
occasioned
in
the
strasburgers
fantasies
was
so
general
such
an
overpowering
mastership
had
it
got
of
all
the
faculties
of
the
strasburgers
minds
so
many
strange
things
with
equal
confidence
on
all
sides
and
with
equal
eloquence
in
all
places
were
spoken
and
sworn
to
concerning
it
that
turned
the
whole
stream
of
all
discourse
and
wonder
towards
it
every
soul
good
and
bad
rich
and
poor
learned
and
unlearned
doctor
and
student
mistress
and
maid
gentle
and
simple
nun
flesh
and
flesh
in
strasburg
spent
their
time
in
hearing
tidings
about
it
every
eye
in
strasburg
languished
to
see
it
every
finger
every
thumb
in
strasburg
burned
to
touch
it
now
what
might
add
if
any
thing
may
be
thought
necessary
to
add
to
so
vehement
a
desire
was
this
that
the
centinel
the
drummer
the
trumpeter
the
trumpeter
wife
the
burgomaster
widow
the
master
of
the
inn
and
the
master
of
the
inn
wife
how
widely
soever
they
all
differed
every
one
from
another
in
their
testimonies
and
description
of
the
stranger
nose
they
all
agreed
together
in
two
points
namely
that
he
was
gone
to
frankfort
and
would
not
return
to
strasburg
till
that
day
month
and
secondly
whether
his
nose
was
true
or
false
that
the
stranger
himself
was
one
of
the
most
perfect
paragons
of
beauty
the
man
the
most
genteel
the
most
generous
of
his
purse
the
most
courteous
in
his
carriage
that
had
ever
entered
the
gates
of
strasburg
that
as
he
rode
with
scymetar
slung
loosely
to
his
wrist
thro
the
streets
and
walked
with
his
breeches
across
the
parade
was
with
so
sweet
an
air
of
careless
modesty
and
so
manly
withal
as
would
have
put
the
heart
in
jeopardy
had
his
nose
not
stood
in
his
way
of
every
virgin
who
had
cast
her
eyes
upon
him
i
call
not
upon
that
heart
which
is
a
stranger
to
the
throbs
and
yearnings
of
curiosity
so
excited
to
justify
the
abbess
of
quedlingberg
the
prioress
the
deaness
and
for
sending
at
for
the
trumpeter
wife
she
went
through
the
streets
of
strasburg
with
her
husband
trumpet
in
her
hand
the
best
apparatus
the
straitness
of
the
time
would
allow
her
for
the
illustration
of
her
theory
she
staid
no
longer
than
three
days
the
centinel
and
drummer
nothing
on
this
side
of
old
athens
could
equal
them
they
read
their
lectures
under
the
to
comers
and
goers
with
all
the
pomp
of
a
chrysippus
and
a
crantor
in
their
porticos
the
master
of
the
inn
with
his
ostler
on
his
read
his
also
in
the
same
stile
under
the
portico
or
gateway
of
his
his
wife
hers
more
privately
in
a
back
room
all
flocked
to
their
lectures
not
promiscuously
but
to
this
or
that
as
is
ever
the
way
as
faith
and
credulity
marshal
them
in
a
word
each
strasburger
came
crouding
for
intelligence
and
every
strasburger
had
the
intelligence
he
wanted
is
worth
remarking
for
the
benefit
of
all
demonstrators
in
natural
philosophy
that
as
soon
as
the
trumpeter
wife
had
finished
the
abbess
of
quedlingberg
private
lecture
and
had
begun
to
read
in
public
which
she
did
upon
a
stool
in
the
middle
of
the
great
parade
she
incommoded
the
other
demonstrators
mainly
by
gaining
incontinently
the
most
fashionable
part
of
the
city
of
strasburg
for
her
auditory
but
when
a
demonstrator
in
philosophy
cries
slawkenbergius
has
a
trumpet
for
an
apparatus
pray
what
rival
in
science
can
pretend
to
be
heard
besides
him
whilst
the
unlearned
thro
these
conduits
of
intelligence
were
all
busied
in
getting
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
well
where
truth
keeps
her
little
court
were
the
learned
in
their
way
as
busy
in
pumping
her
up
thro
the
conduits
of
dialect
induction
they
concerned
themselves
not
with
facts
they
reasoned
not
one
profession
had
thrown
more
light
upon
this
subject
than
the
faculty
had
not
all
their
disputes
about
it
run
into
the
affair
of
wens
and
oedematous
swellings
they
could
not
keep
clear
of
them
for
their
bloods
and
souls
the
stranger
nose
had
nothing
to
do
either
with
wens
or
oedematous
swellings
it
was
demonstrated
however
very
satisfactorily
that
such
a
ponderous
mass
of
heterogenous
matter
could
not
be
congested
and
conglomerated
to
the
nose
whilst
the
infant
was
in
utera
without
destroying
the
statical
balance
of
the
foetus
and
throwing
it
plump
upon
its
head
nine
months
before
the
the
opponents
granted
the
theory
they
denied
the
consequences
and
if
a
suitable
provision
of
veins
arteries
said
they
was
not
laid
in
for
the
due
nourishment
of
such
a
nose
in
the
very
first
stamina
and
rudiments
of
its
formation
before
it
came
into
the
world
bating
the
case
of
wens
it
could
not
regularly
grow
and
be
sustained
afterwards
this
was
all
answered
by
a
dissertation
upon
nutriment
and
the
effect
which
nutriment
had
in
extending
the
vessels
and
in
the
increase
and
prolongation
of
the
muscular
parts
to
the
greatest
growth
and
expansion
imaginable
in
the
triumph
of
which
theory
they
went
so
far
as
to
affirm
that
there
was
no
cause
in
nature
why
a
nose
might
not
grow
to
the
size
of
the
man
himself
the
respondents
satisfied
the
world
this
event
could
never
happen
to
them
so
long
as
a
man
had
but
one
stomach
and
one
pair
of
lungs
for
the
stomach
said
they
being
the
only
organ
destined
for
the
reception
of
food
and
turning
it
into
chyle
and
the
lungs
the
only
engine
of
sanguification
it
could
possibly
work
off
no
more
than
what
the
appetite
brought
it
or
admitting
the
possibility
of
a
man
overloading
his
stomach
nature
had
set
bounds
however
to
his
lungs
the
engine
was
of
a
determined
size
and
strength
and
could
elaborate
but
a
certain
quantity
in
a
given
time
that
is
it
could
produce
just
as
much
blood
as
was
sufficient
for
one
single
man
and
no
more
so
that
if
there
was
as
much
nose
as
man
they
proved
a
mortification
must
necessarily
ensue
and
forasmuch
as
there
could
not
be
a
support
for
both
that
the
nose
must
either
fall
off
from
the
man
or
the
man
inevitably
fall
off
from
his
nose
nature
accommodates
herself
to
these
emergencies
cried
the
opponents
else
what
do
you
say
to
the
case
of
a
whole
stomach
a
whole
pair
of
lungs
and
but
half
a
man
when
both
his
legs
have
been
unfortunately
shot
off
he
dies
of
a
plethora
said
they
or
must
spit
blood
and
in
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
go
off
in
a
it
happens
otherwise
replied
the
it
ought
not
said
they
the
more
curious
and
intimate
inquirers
after
nature
and
her
doings
though
they
went
hand
in
hand
a
good
way
together
yet
they
all
divided
about
the
nose
at
last
almost
as
much
as
the
faculty
itself
they
amicably
laid
it
down
that
there
was
a
just
and
geometrical
arrangement
and
proportion
of
the
several
parts
of
the
human
frame
to
its
several
destinations
offices
and
functions
which
could
not
be
transgressed
but
within
certain
limits
that
nature
though
she
sported
she
sported
within
a
certain
circle
and
they
could
not
agree
about
the
diameter
of
it
the
logicians
stuck
much
closer
to
the
point
before
them
than
any
of
the
classes
of
the
literati
they
began
and
ended
with
the
word
nose
and
had
it
not
been
for
a
petitio
principii
which
one
of
the
ablest
of
them
ran
his
head
against
in
the
beginning
of
the
combat
the
whole
controversy
had
been
settled
at
once
a
nose
argued
the
logician
can
not
bleed
without
blood
and
not
only
blood
but
blood
circulating
in
it
to
supply
the
phaenomenon
with
a
succession
of
drops
a
stream
being
but
a
quicker
succession
of
drops
that
is
included
said
he
now
death
continued
the
logician
being
nothing
but
the
stagnation
of
the
blood
i
deny
the
definition
death
is
the
separation
of
the
soul
from
the
body
said
his
antagonist
then
we
do
agree
about
our
weapons
said
the
logician
then
there
is
an
end
of
the
dispute
replied
the
antagonist
the
civilians
were
still
more
concise
what
they
offered
being
more
in
the
nature
of
a
decree
than
a
dispute
such
a
monstrous
nose
said
they
had
it
been
a
true
nose
could
not
possibly
have
been
suffered
in
civil
society
and
if
false
to
impose
upon
society
with
such
false
signs
and
tokens
was
a
still
greater
violation
of
its
rights
and
must
have
had
still
less
mercy
shewn
it
the
only
objection
to
this
was
that
if
it
proved
any
thing
it
proved
the
stranger
nose
was
neither
true
nor
false
this
left
room
for
the
controversy
to
go
on
it
was
maintained
by
the
advocates
of
the
ecclesiastic
court
that
there
was
nothing
to
inhibit
a
decree
since
the
stranger
ex
mero
motu
had
confessed
he
had
been
at
the
promontory
of
noses
and
had
got
one
of
the
goodliest
to
this
it
was
answered
it
was
impossible
there
should
be
such
a
place
as
the
promontory
of
noses
and
the
learned
be
ignorant
where
it
lay
the
commissary
of
the
bishop
of
strasburg
undertook
the
advocates
explained
this
matter
in
a
treatise
upon
proverbial
phrases
shewing
them
that
the
promontory
of
noses
was
a
mere
allegorick
expression
importing
no
more
than
that
nature
had
given
him
a
long
nose
in
proof
of
which
with
great
learning
he
cited
the
underwritten
authorities

nineteen

i
must
say
unluckily

they
were

the

just

in

in
reading
this
my
father
would
always
shake
his
head
in
the
ninth
house
with
the
arabians
allotted
to
religion
it
appeared
that
martin
luther
did
not
care
one
stiver
about
the
matter
and
that
from
the
horoscope
directed
to
the
conjunction
of
mars
they
made
it
plain
likewise
he
must
die
cursing
and
blaspheming
with
the
blast
of
which
his
soul
being
steep
in
guilt
sailed
before
the
wind
in
the
lake
of
the
little
objection
of
the
lutheran
doctors
to
this
was
that
it
must
certainly
be
the
soul
of
another
man
born
which
was
forced
to
sail
down
before
the
wind
in
that
manner
inasmuch
as
it
appeared
from
the
register
of
islaben
in
the
county
of
mansfelt
that
luther
was
not
born
in
the
year
but
in
and
not
on
the
day
of
october
but
on
the
of
november
the
eve
of
martinmas
day
from
whence
he
had
the
name
of
martin
i
must
break
off
my
translation
for
a
moment
for
if
i
did
not
i
know
i
should
no
more
be
able
to
shut
my
eyes
in
bed
than
the
abbess
of
quedlingberg
it
is
to
tell
the
reader
that
my
father
never
read
this
passage
of
slawkenbergius
to
my
uncle
toby
but
with
triumph
not
over
my
uncle
toby
for
he
never
opposed
him
in
it
but
over
the
whole
world
now
you
see
brother
toby
he
would
say
looking
up
christian
names
are
not
such
indifferent
things
had
luther
here
been
called
by
any
other
name
but
martin
he
would
have
been
damn
to
all
eternity
not
that
i
look
upon
martin
he
would
add
as
a
good
name
far
from
it
is
something
better
than
a
neutral
and
but
a
little
yet
little
as
it
is
you
see
it
was
of
some
service
to
him
my
father
knew
the
weakness
of
this
prop
to
his
hypothesis
as
well
as
the
best
logician
could
shew
him
yet
so
strange
is
the
weakness
of
man
at
the
same
time
as
it
fell
in
his
way
he
could
not
for
his
life
but
make
use
of
it
and
it
was
certainly
for
this
reason
that
though
there
are
many
stories
in
hafen
slawkenbergius
decades
full
as
entertaining
as
this
i
am
translating
yet
there
is
not
one
amongst
them
which
my
father
read
over
with
half
the
delight
it
flattered
two
of
his
strangest
hypotheses
together
his
names
and
his
i
will
be
bold
to
say
he
might
have
read
all
the
books
in
the
alexandrian
library
had
not
fate
taken
other
care
of
them
and
not
have
met
with
a
book
or
passage
in
one
which
hit
two
such
nails
as
these
upon
the
head
at
one
stroke
the
two
universities
of
strasburg
were
hard
tugging
at
this
affair
of
luther
navigation
the
protestant
doctors
had
demonstrated
that
he
had
not
sailed
right
before
the
wind
as
the
popish
doctors
had
pretended
and
as
every
one
knew
there
was
no
sailing
full
in
the
teeth
of
it
they
were
going
to
settle
in
case
he
had
sailed
how
many
points
he
was
off
whether
martin
had
doubled
the
cape
or
had
fallen
upon
a
and
no
doubt
as
it
was
an
enquiry
of
much
edification
at
least
to
those
who
understood
this
sort
of
navigation
they
had
gone
on
with
it
in
spite
of
the
size
of
the
stranger
nose
had
not
the
size
of
the
stranger
nose
drawn
off
the
attention
of
the
world
from
what
they
were
about
it
was
their
business
to
follow
the
abbess
of
quedlingberg
and
her
four
dignitaries
was
no
stop
for
the
enormity
of
the
stranger
nose
running
full
as
much
in
their
fancies
as
their
case
of
conscience
the
affair
of
their
kept
cold
in
a
word
the
printers
were
ordered
to

their
types

with
a
silver
tassel
upon

it

a
to
have
guessed
on

side
of
the
nose
the
two
universities
would
split

the
doctors

the

the
doctors
who
maintained
the
reality
of
the
it
extends
only
to
all
possible
things
replied
the
lutherans
by
god
in
heaven
cried
the
popish
doctors
he
can
make
a
nose
if
he
thinks
fit
as
big
as
the
steeple
of
strasburg
now
the
steeple
of
strasburg
being
the
biggest
and
the
tallest
to
be
seen
in
the
whole
world
the
denied
that
a
nose
of
geometrical
feet
in
length
could
be
worn
at
least
by
a
man
the
popish
doctors
swore
it
could
the
lutheran
doctors
said
no
it
could
not
this
at
once
started
a
new
dispute
which
they
pursued
a
great
way
upon
the
extent
and
limitation
of
the
moral
and
natural
attributes
of
god
that
controversy
led
them
naturally
into
thomas
aquinas
and
thomas
aquinas
to
the
devil
the
stranger
nose
was
no
more
heard
of
in
the
dispute
it
just
served
as
a
frigate
to
launch
them
into
the
gulph
of
and
then
they
all
sailed
before
the
wind
heat
is
in
proportion
to
the
want
of
true
knowledge
the
controversy
about
the
attributes
instead
of
cooling
on
the
contrary
had
inflamed
the
strasburgers
imaginations
to
a
most
inordinate
degree
the
less
they
understood
of
the
matter
the
greater
was
their
wonder
about
it
they
were
left
in
all
the
distresses
of
desire
unsatisfied
saw
their
doctors
the
parchmentarians
the
brassarians
the
turpentarians

we
now
towards
the
catastrophe
of

i

catastrophe
cries
slawkenbergius
inasmuch
as
a
tale
with
parts
rightly
disposed
not
only
rejoiceth
gaudet
in
the
catastrophe
and
peripeitia
of
a
drama
but
rejoiceth
moreover
in
all
the
essential
and
integrant
parts
of
it
it
has
its
protasis
epitasis
catastasis
its
catastrophe
or
peripeitia
growing
one
out
of
the
other
in
it
in
the
order
aristotle
first
planted
them
without
which
a
tale
had
better
never
be
told
at
all
says
slawkenbergius
but
be
kept
to
a
man
self
in
all
my
ten
tales
in
all
my
ten
decades
have
i
slawkenbergius
tied
down
every
tale
of
them
as
tightly
to
this
rule
as
i
have
done
this
of
the
stranger
and
his
nose
from
his
first
parley
with
the
centinel
to
his
leaving

after
pulling
off

of
breeches

the
protasis
or

entrance
where
the
characters
of
the
personae
dramatis
are
just
touched
in
and
the
subject
slightly
begun
the
epitasis
wherein
the
action
is
more
fully
entered
upon
and
heightened
till
it
arrives
at
its
state
or
height
called
the
catastasis
and
which
usually
takes
up
the
and
act

included
within
that
busy
period
of
my
tale
betwixt
the
first
night
uproar
about
the
nose
to
the
conclusion
of
the
trumpeter
wife
lectures
upon
it
in
the
middle
of
the
grand
parade
and
from
the
first
embarking
of
the
learned
in
the
dispute
to
the
doctors
finally
sailing
away
and
leaving
the
strasburgers
upon
the
beach
in
distress
is
the
catastasis
or
the
ripening
of
the
incidents
and
passions
for
their
bursting
forth
in
the
fifth
act
this
commences
with
the
setting
out
of
the
strasburgers
in
the
frankfort
road
and
terminates
in
unwinding
the
labyrinth
and
bringing
the
hero
out
of
a
state
of
agitation
as
aristotle
calls
it
to
a
state
of
rest
and
quietness
this
says
hafen
slawkenbergius
constitutes
the
catastrophe
or
peripeitia
of
my
tale
and
that
is
the
part
of
it
i
am
going
to
relate
we
left
the
stranger
behind
the
curtain
asleep
he
enters
now
upon
the
stage
what
dost
thou
prick
up
thy
ears
at
is
nothing
but
a
man
upon
a
horse
was
the
last
word
the
stranger
uttered
to
his
mule
it
was
not
proper
then
to
tell
the
reader
that
the
mule
took
his
master
word
for
it
and
without
any
more
ifs
or
ands
let
the
traveller
and
his
horse
pass
by
the
traveller
was
hastening
with
all
diligence
to
get
to
strasburg
that
night
what
a
fool
am
i
said
the
traveller
to
himself
when
he
had
rode
about
a
league
farther
to
think
of
getting
into
strasburg
this
strasburg
the
great
strasburg
strasburg
the
capital
of
all
alsatia
strasburg
an
imperial
city
strasburg
a
sovereign
state
strasburg
garrisoned
with
five
thousand
of
the
best
troops
in
all
the
world
alas
if
i
was
at
the
gates
of
strasburg
this
moment
i
could
not
gain
admittance
into
it
for
a
ducat
nay
a
ducat
and
half
is
too
much
better
go
back
to
the
last
inn
i
have
passed
than
lie
i
know
not
where
or
give
i
know
not
what
the
traveller
as
he
made
these
reflections
in
his
mind
turned
his
horse
head
about
and
three
minutes
after
the
stranger
had
been
conducted
into
his
chamber
he
arrived
at
the
same
inn
we
have
bacon
in
the
house
said
the
host
and
bread
and
till
eleven
this
night
had
three
eggs
in
it
but
a
stranger
who
arrived
an
hour
ago
has
had
them
dressed
into
an
omelet
and
we
have
alas
said
the
traveller
harassed
as
i
am
i
want
nothing
but
a
i
have
one
as
soft
as
is
in
alsatia
said
the
host
the
stranger
continued
he
should
have
slept
in
it
for
is
my
best
bed
but
upon
the
score
of
his
he
has
got
a
defluxion
said
the
not
that
i
know
cried
the
but
is
a
and
jacinta
said
he
looking
towards
the
maid
imagined
there
was
not
room
in
it
to
turn
his
nose
why
so
cried
the
traveller
starting
it
is
so
long
a
nose
replied
the
the
traveller
fixed
his
eyes
upon
jacinta
then
upon
the
ground
kneeled
upon
his
right
knee
had
just
got
his
hand
laid
upon
his
breast
trifle
not
with
my
anxiety
said
he
rising
up
is
no
trifle
said
jacinta
is
the
most
glorious
nose
the
traveller
fell
upon
his
knee
again
laid
his
hand
upon
his
breast
then
said
he
looking
up
to
heaven
thou
hast
conducted
me
to
the
end
of
my
pilgrimage
is
diego
the
traveller
was
the
brother
of
the
julia
so
often
invoked
that
night
by
the
stranger
as
he
rode
from
strasburg
upon
his
mule
and
was
come
on
her
part
in
quest
of
him
he
had
accompanied
his
sister
from
valadolid
across
the
pyrenean
mountains
through
france
and
had
many
an
entangled
skein
to
wind
off
in
pursuit
of
him
through
the
many
meanders
and
abrupt
turnings
of
a
lover
thorny
tracks
julia
had
sunk
under
it
and
had
not
been
able
to
go
a
step
farther
than
to
lyons
where
with
the
many
disquietudes
of
a
tender
heart
which
all
talk
of
but
few
feel
she
sicken
but
had
just
strength
to
write
a
letter
to
diego
and
having
conjured
her
brother
never
to
see
her
face
till
he
had
found
him
out
and
put
the
letter
into
his
hands
julia
took
to
her
bed
fernandez
for
that
was
her
brother
name
tho
the
was
as
soft
as
any
one
in
alsace
yet
he
could
not
shut
his
eyes
in
as
soon
as
it
was
day
he
rose
and
hearing
diego
was
risen
too
he
entered
his
chamber
and
discharged
his
sister
commission
the
letter
was
as
follows
diego
my
suspicions
of
your
nose
were
justly
excited
or
not
is
not
now
to
inquire
it
is
enough
i
have
not
had
firmness
to
put
them
to
farther
tryal
could
i
know
so
little
of
myself
when
i
sent
my
duenna
to
forbid
your
coming
more
under
my
lattice
or
how
could
i
know
so
little
of
you
diego
as
to
imagine
you
would
not
have
staid
one
day
in
valadolid
to
have
given
ease
to
my
doubts
was
i
to
be
abandoned
diego
because
i
was
deceived
or
was
it
kind
to
take
me
at
my
word
whether
my
suspicions
were
just
or
no
and
leave
me
as
you
did
a
prey
to
much
uncertainty
and
sorrow
what
manner
julia
has
resented
this
my
brother
when
he
puts
this
letter
into
your
hands
will
tell
you
he
will
tell
you
in
how
few
moments
she
repented
of
the
rash
message
she
had
sent
you
in
what
frantic
haste
she
flew
to
her
lattice
and
how
many
days
and
nights
together
she
leaned
immoveably
upon
her
elbow
looking
through
it
towards
the
way
which
diego
was
wont
to
come
will
tell
you
when
she
heard
of
your
departure
how
her
spirits
deserted
her
how
her
heart
sicken
how
piteously
she
mourned
how
low
she
hung
her
head
o
diego
how
many
weary
steps
has
my
brother
pity
led
me
by
the
hand
languishing
to
trace
out
yours
how
far
has
desire
carried
me
beyond
strength
and
how
oft
have
i
fainted
by
the
way
and
sunk
into
his
arms
with
only
power
to
cry
out
o
my
diego
the
gentleness
of
your
carriage
has
not
belied
your
heart
you
will
fly
to
me
almost
as
fast
as
you
fled
from
me
haste
as
you
will
you
will
arrive
but
to
see
me
is
a
bitter
draught
diego
but
oh
is
embittered
still
more
by
dying
un
she
could
proceed
no
farther
slawkenbergius
supposes
the
word
intended
was
unconvinced
but
her
strength
would
not
enable
her
to
finish
her
letter
the
heart
of
the
courteous
diego
as
he
read
the
letter
he
ordered
his
mule
forthwith
and
fernandez
horse
to
be
saddled
and
as
no
vent
in
prose
is
equal
to
that
of
poetry
in
such
conflicts
chance
which
as
often
directs
us
to
remedies
as
to
diseases
having
thrown
a
piece
of
charcoal
into
the
window
diego
availed
himself
of
it
and
whilst
the
hostler
was
getting
ready
his
mule
he
eased
his
mind
against
the
wall
as
follows
ode
harsh
and
untuneful
are
the
notes
of
love
unless
my
julia
strikes
the
key
her
hand
alone
can
touch
the
part
whose
dulcet
movement
charms
the
heart
and
governs
all
the
man
with
sympathetick
sway
o
julia
the
lines
were
very
natural
for
they
were
nothing
at
all
to
the
purpose
says
slawkenbergius
and
is
a
pity
there
were
no
more
of
them
but
whether
it
was
that
seig
diego
was
slow
in
composing
verses
or
the
hostler
quick
in
saddling
mules
is
not
averred
certain
it
was
that
diego
mule
and
fernandez
horse
were
ready
at
the
door
of
the
inn
before
diego
was
ready
for
his
second
stanza
so
without
staying
to
finish
his
ode
they
both
mounted
sallied
forth
passed
the
rhine
traversed
alsace
shaped
their
course
towards
lyons
and
before
the
strasburgers
and
the
abbess
of
quedlingberg
had
set
out
on
their
cavalcade
had
fernandez
diego
and
his
julia
crossed
the
pyrenean
mountains
and
got
safe
to
valadolid
is
needless
to
inform
the
geographical
reader
that
when
diego
was
in
spain
it
was
not
possible
to
meet
the
courteous
stranger
in
the
frankfort
road
it
is
enough
to
say
that
of
all
restless
desires
curiosity
being
the
strongest
the
strasburgers
felt
the
full
force
of
it
and
that
for
three
days
and
nights
they
were
tossed
to
and
fro
in
the
frankfort
road
with
the
tempestuous
fury
of
this
passion
before
they
could
submit
to
return
when
alas
an
event
was
prepared
for
them
of
all
other
the
most
grievous
that
could
befal
a
free
people
as
this
revolution
of
the
strasburgers
affairs
is
often
spoken
of
and
little
understood
i
will
in
ten
words
says
slawkenbergius
give
the
world
an
explanation
of
it
and
with
it
put
an
end
to
my
tale
every
body
knows
of
the
grand
system
of
universal
monarchy
wrote
by
order
of
mons
colbert
and
put
in
manuscript
into
the
hands
of
lewis
the
fourteenth
in
the
year
is
as
well
known
that
one
branch
out
of
many
of
that
system
was
the
getting
possession
of
strasburg
to
favour
an
entrance
at
all
times
into
suabia
in
order
to
disturb
the
quiet
of
germany
and
that
in
consequence
of
this
plan
strasburg
unhappily
fell
at
length
into
their
hands
it
is
the
lot
of
a
few
to
trace
out
the
true
springs
of
this
and
such
like
revolutions
the
vulgar
look
too
high
for
them
statesmen
look
too
low
truth
for
once
lies
in
the
middle
what
a
fatal
thing
is
the
popular
pride
of
a
free
city
cries
one
historian
the
strasburgers
deemed
it
a
diminution
of
their
freedom
to
receive
an
imperial
garrison
so
fell
a
prey
to
a
french
one
the
fate
says
another
of
the
strasburgers
may
be
a
warning
to
all
free
people
to
save
their
they
anticipated
their
revenues
brought
themselves
under
taxes
exhausted
their
strength
and
in
the
end
became
so
weak
a
people
they
had
not
strength
to
keep
their
gates
shut
and
so
the
french
pushed
them
open
alas
alas
cries
slawkenbergius
was
not
the
french
was
curiosity
pushed
them
open
the
french
indeed
who
are
ever
upon
the
catch
when
they
saw
the
strasburgers
men
women
and
children
all
marched
out
to
follow
the
stranger
nose
each
man
followed
his
own
and
marched
in
trade
and
manufactures
have
decayed
and
gradually
grown
down
ever
since
but
not
from
any
cause
which
commercial
heads
have
assigned
for
it
is
owing
to
this
only
that
noses
have
ever
so
run
in
their
heads
that
the
strasburgers
could
not
follow
their
business
alas
alas
cries
slawkenbergius
making
an
exclamation
it
is
not
the
first
and
i
fear
will
not
be
the
last
fortress
that
has
been
either
won
or
lost
by
noses
the
end
of
slawkenbergius
tale
chapter
with
all
this
learning
upon
noses
running
perpetually
in
my
fancy
with
so
many
family
prejudices
and
ten
decades
of
such
tales
running
on
for
ever
along
with
them
how
was
it
possible
with
such
exquisite
was
it
a
true
nose
that
a
man
with
such
exquisite
feelings
as
my
father
had
could
bear
the
shock
at
all
below
stairs
or
indeed
above
stairs
in
any
other
posture
but
the
very
posture
i
have
described
throw
yourself
down
upon
the
bed
a
dozen
times
taking
care
only
to
place
a
first
in
a
chair
on
one
side
of
it
before
you
do
it
but
was
the
stranger
nose
a
true
nose
or
was
it
a
false
one
to
tell
that
madam
would
be
to
do
injury
to
one
of
the
best
tales
in
the
and
that
is
the
tenth
of
the
tenth
decade
which
immediately
follows
this
this
tale
cried
slawkenbergius
somewhat
exultingly
has
been
reserved
by
me
for
the
concluding
tale
of
my
whole
work
knowing
right
well
that
when
i
shall
have
told
it
and
my
reader
shall
have
read
it
thro
be
even
high
time
for
both
of
us
to
shut
up
the
book
inasmuch
continues
slawkenbergius
as
i
know
of
no
tale
which
could
possibly
ever
go
down
after
it
is
a
tale
indeed
this
sets
out
with
the
first
interview
in
the
inn
at
lyons
when
fernandez
left
the
courteous
stranger
and
his
sister
julia
alone
in
her
chamber
and
is
the
intricacies
of
diego
and
julia
heavens
thou
art
a
strange
creature
slawkenbergius
what
a
whimsical
view
of
the
involutions
of
the
heart
of
woman
hast
thou
opened
how
this
can
ever
be
translated
and
yet
if
this
specimen
of
tales
and
the
exquisitiveness
of
his
moral
should
please
the
world
translated
shall
a
couple
of
volumes
else
how
this
can
ever
be
translated
into
good
english
i
have
no
sort
of
conception
there
seems
in
some
passages
to
want
a
sixth
sense
to
do
it
what
can
he
mean
by
the
lambent
pupilability
of
slow
low
dry
chat
five
notes
below
the
natural
tone
which
you
know
madam
is
little
more
than
a
whisper
the
moment
i
pronounced
the
words
i
could
perceive
an
attempt
towards
a
vibration
in
the
strings
about
the
region
of
the
the
brain
made
no
there
often
no
good
understanding
betwixt
i
felt
as
if
i
understood
i
had
no
the
movement
could
not
be
without
i
lost
i
can
make
nothing
of
it
unless
may
it
please
your
worships
the
voice
in
that
case
being
little
more
than
a
whisper
unavoidably
forces
the
eyes
to
approach
not
only
within
six
inches
of
each
other
but
to
look
into
the
pupils
is
not
that
dangerous
but
it
ca
be
avoided
for
to
look
up
to
the
cieling
in
that
case
the
two
chins
unavoidably
meet
and
to
look
down
into
each
other
lap
the
foreheads
come
to
immediate
contact
which
at
once
puts
an
end
to
the
conference
i
mean
to
the
sentimental
part
of
what
is
left
madam
is
not
worth
stooping
for
chapter
my
father
lay
stretched
across
the
bed
as
still
as
if
the
hand
of
death
had
pushed
him
down
for
a
full
hour
and
a
half
before
he
began
to
play
upon
the
floor
with
the
toe
of
that
foot
which
hung
over
the
my
uncle
toby
heart
was
a
pound
lighter
for
in
a
few
moments
his
the
knuckles
of
which
had
all
the
time
reclined
upon
the
handle
of
the
came
to
its
feeling
he
thrust
it
a
little
more
within
the
valance
drew
up
his
hand
when
he
had
done
into
his
bosom
gave
a
hem
my
good
uncle
toby
with
infinite
pleasure
answered
it
and
full
gladly
would
have
ingrafted
a
sentence
of
consolation
upon
the
opening
it
afforded
but
having
no
talents
as
i
said
that
way
and
fearing
moreover
that
he
might
set
out
with
something
which
might
make
a
bad
matter
worse
he
contented
himself
with
resting
his
chin
placidly
upon
the
cross
of
his
crutch
now
whether
the
compression
shortened
my
uncle
toby
face
into
a
more
pleasurable
oval
or
that
the
philanthropy
of
his
heart
in
seeing
his
brother
beginning
to
emerge
out
of
the
sea
of
his
afflictions
had
braced
up
his
muscles
so
that
the
compression
upon
his
chin
only
doubled
the
benignity
which
was
there
before
is
not
hard
to
my
father
in
turning
his
eyes
was
struck
with
such
a
gleam
of
in
his
face
as
melted
down
the
sullenness
of
his
grief
in
a
moment
he
broke
silence
as
follows
chapter
did
ever
man
brother
toby
cried
my
father
raising
himself
upon
his
elbow
and
turning
himself
round
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
bed
where
my
uncle
toby
was
sitting
in
his
old
fringed
chair
with
his
chin
resting
upon
his
crutch
did
ever
a
poor
unfortunate
man
brother
toby
cried
my
father
receive
so
many
lashes
the
most
i
ever
saw
given
quoth
my
uncle
toby
ringing
the
bell
at
the
bed
head
for
trim
was
to
a
grenadier
i
think
in
mackay
regiment
had
my
uncle
toby
shot
a
bullet
through
my
father
heart
he
could
not
have
fallen
down
with
his
nose
upon
the
quilt
more
suddenly
bless
me
said
my
uncle
toby
chapter
was
it
mackay

quoth
my
uncle
toby
where
the
poor
grenadier
was
so
unmercifully
whipp
at

about

was
innocent
cried
trim
with
a
deep
and
he
was
whipp
may
it
please
your
honour
almost
to
death
they
had
better
have
shot
him
outright
as
he
begg
and
he
had
gone
directly
to
heaven
for
he
was
as
innocent
as
your
i
thank
thee
trim
quoth
my
uncle
i
never
think
of
his
continued
trim
and
my
poor
brother
misfortunes
for
we
were
all
three
but
i
cry
like
a
tears
are
no
proof
of
cowardice
i
drop
them
myself
cried
my
uncle
i
know
your
honour
does
replied
trim
and
so
am
not
ashamed
of
it
but
to
think
may
it
please
your
honour
continued
trim
a
tear
stealing
into
the
corner
of
his
eye
as
he
spoke
to
think
of
two
virtuous
lads
with
hearts
as
warm
in
their
bodies
and
as
honest
as
god
could
make
them
the
children
of
honest
people
going
forth
with
gallant
spirits
to
seek
their
fortunes
in
the
world
and
fall
into
such
evils
poor
tom
to
be
tortured
upon
a
rack
for
nothing
but
marrying
a
jew
widow
who
sold
sausages
honest
dick
johnson
soul
to
be
scourged
out
of
his
body
for
the
ducats
another
man
put
into
his
knapsack
o
these
are
misfortunes
cried
trim
pulling
out
his
handkerchief
these
are
misfortunes
may
it
please
your
honour
worth
lying
down
and
crying
over
my
father
could
not
help
blushing
be
a
pity
trim
quoth
my
uncle
toby
thou
shouldst
ever
feel
sorrow
of
thy
own
thou
feelest
it
so
tenderly
for
replied
the
corporal
brightening
up
his
face
your
honour
knows
i
have
neither
wife
or
child
i
can
have
no
sorrows
in
this
my
father
could
not
help
as
few
as
any
man
trim
replied
my
uncle
toby
nor
can
i
see
how
a
fellow
of
thy
light
heart
can
suffer
but
from
the
distress
of
poverty
in
thy
old
age
when
thou
art
passed
all
services
trim
and
hast
outlived
thy
an
please
your
honour
never
fear
replied
trim
but
i
would
have
thee
never
fear
trim
replied
my
uncle
toby
and
therefore
continued
my
uncle
toby
throwing
down
his
crutch
and
getting
up
upon
his
legs
as
he
uttered
the
word
therefore
in
recompence
trim
of
thy
long
fidelity
to
me
and
that
goodness
of
thy
heart
i
have
had
such
proofs
of
whilst
thy
master
is
worth
a
shilling
thou
shalt
never
ask
elsewhere
trim
for
a
penny
trim
attempted
to
thank
my
uncle
toby
but
had
not
power
tears
trickled
down
his
cheeks
faster
than
he
could
wipe
them
off
he
laid
his
hands
upon
his
breast
made
a
bow
to
the
ground
and
shut
the
door
i
have
left
trim
my
cried
my
uncle
toby
my
father
i
have
left
him
moreover
a
pension
continued
my
uncle
my
father
looked
grave
chapter
is
this
a
fit
time
said
my
father
to
himself
to
talk
of
pensions
and
grenadiers
chapter
when
my
uncle
toby
first
mentioned
the
grenadier
my
father
i
said
fell
down
with
his
nose
flat
to
the
quilt
and
as
suddenly
as
if
my
uncle
toby
had
shot
him
but
it
was
not
added
that
every
other
limb
and
member
of
my
father
instantly
relapsed
with
his
nose
into
the
same
precise
attitude
in
which
he
lay
first
described
so
that
when
corporal
trim
left
the
room
and
my
father
found
himself
disposed
to
rise
off
the
bed
he
had
all
the
little
preparatory
movements
to
run
over
again
before
he
could
do
it
attitudes
are
nothing
madam
is
the
transition
from
one
attitude
to
another
like
the
preparation
and
resolution
of
the
discord
into
harmony
which
is
all
in
all
for
which
reason
my
father
played
the
same
jig
over
again
with
his
toe
upon
the
floor
pushed
the
still
a
little
farther
within
the
valance
gave
a
hem
raised
himself
up
upon
his
elbow
and
was
just
beginning
to
address
himself
to
my
uncle
toby
when
recollecting
the
unsuccessfulness
of
his
first
effort
in
that
attitude
he
got
upon
his
legs
and
in
making
the
third
turn
across
the
room
he
stopped
short
before
my
uncle
toby
and
laying
the
three
first
fingers
of
his
in
the
palm
of
his
left
and
stooping
a
little
he
addressed
himself
to
my
uncle
toby
as
follows
chapter
when
i
reflect
brother
toby
upon
man
and
take
a
view
of
that
dark
side
of
him
which
represents
his
life
as
open
to
so
many
causes
of
trouble
when
i
consider
brother
toby
how
oft
we
eat
the
bread
of
affliction
and
that
we
are
born
to
it
as
to
the
portion
of
our
inheritance
i
was
born
to
nothing
quoth
my
uncle
toby
interrupting
my
father
but
my
commission
zooks
said
my
father
did
not
my
uncle
leave
you
a
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
a
year
what
could
i
have
done
without
it
replied
my
uncle
toby
that
another
concern
said
my
father
testily
but
i
say
toby
when
one
runs
over
the
catalogue
of
all
the
and
sorrowful
items
with
which
the
heart
of
man
is
overcharged
is
wonderful
by
what
hidden
resources
the
mind
is
enabled
to
stand
out
and
bear
itself
up
as
it
does
against
the
impositions
laid
upon
our
is
by
the
assistance
of
almighty
god
cried
my
uncle
toby
looking
up
and
pressing
the
palms
of
his
hands
close
together
is
not
from
our
own
strength
brother
shandy
a
centinel
in
a
wooden
might
as
well
pretend
to
stand
it
out
against
a
detachment
of
fifty
we
are
upheld
by
the
grace
and
the
assistance
of
the
best
of
beings
that
is
cutting
the
knot
said
my
father
instead
of
untying
it
but
give
me
leave
to
lead
you
brother
toby
a
little
deeper
into
the
mystery
with
all
my
heart
replied
my
uncle
toby
my
father
instantly
exchanged
the
attitude
he
was
in
for
that
in
which
socrates
is
so
finely
painted
by
raffael
in
his
school
of
athens
which
your
connoisseurship
knows
is
so
exquisitely
imagined
that
even
the
particular
manner
of
the
reasoning
of
socrates
is
expressed
by
it
for
he
holds
the
of
his
between
the
and
the
thumb
of
his
right
and
seems
as
if
he
was
saying
to
the
libertine
he
is
reclaiming
grant
me
this
and
this
and
this
and
this
i
do
ask
of
you
they
follow
of
themselves
in
course
so
stood
my
father
holding
fast
his
betwixt
his
finger
and
his
thumb
and
reasoning
with
my
uncle
toby
as
he
sat
in
his
old
fringed
chair
valanced
around
with
worsted
bobs
o
garrick
what
a
rich
scene
of
this
would
thy
exquisite
powers
make
and
how
gladly
would
i
write
such
another
to
avail
myself
of
thy
immortality
and
secure
my
own
behind
it
chapter
though
man
is
of
all
others
the
most
curious
vehicle
said
my
father
yet
at
the
same
time
is
of
so
slight
a
frame
and
so
totteringly
put
together
that
the
sudden
jerks
and
hard
jostlings
it
unavoidably
meets
with
in
this
rugged
journey
would
overset
and
tear
it
to
pieces
a
dozen
times
a
day
was
it
not
brother
toby
that
there
is
a
secret
spring
within
which
spring
said
my
uncle
toby
i
take
to
be
will
that
set
my
child
nose
on
cried
my
father
letting
go
his
finger
and
striking
one
hand
against
the
it
makes
every
thing
straight
for
us
answered
my
uncle
figuratively
speaking
dear
toby
it
may
for
aught
i
know
said
my
father
but
the
spring
i
am
speaking
of
is
that
great
and
elastic
power
within
us
of
counterbalancing
evil
which
like
a
secret
spring
in
a
machine
though
it
ca
prevent
the
shock
at
least
it
imposes
upon
our
sense
of
it
now
my
dear
brother
said
my
father
replacing
his
as
he
was
coming
closer
to
the
point
had
my
child
arrived
safe
into
the
world
unmartyr
in
that
precious
part
of
him
fanciful
and
extravagant
as
i
may
appear
to
the
world
in
my
opinion
of
christian
names
and
of
that
magic
bias
which
good
or
bad
names
irresistibly
impress
upon
our
characters
and
conducts
heaven
is
witness
that
in
the
warmest
transports
of
my
wishes
for
the
prosperity
of
my
child
i
never
once
wished
to
crown
his
head
with
more
glory
and
honour
than
what
george
or
edward
would
have
spread
around
it
but
alas
continued
my
father
as
the
greatest
evil
has
befallen
him
i
must
counteract
and
undo
it
with
the
greatest
good
he
shall
be
christened
trismegistus
brother
i
wish
it
may
answer
replied
my
uncle
toby
rising
up
chapter
what
a
chapter
of
chances
said
my
father
turning
himself
about
upon
the
first
landing
as
he
and
my
uncle
toby
were
going
down
stairs
what
a
long
chapter
of
chances
do
the
events
of
this
world
lay
open
to
us
take
pen
and
ink
in
hand
brother
toby
and
calculate
it
fairly
i
know
no
more
of
calculation
than
this
balluster
said
my
uncle
toby
striking
short
of
it
with
his
crutch
and
hitting
my
father
a
desperate
blow
souse
upon
his
was
a
hundred
to
my
uncle
toby
i
thought
quoth
my
father
rubbing
his
shin
you
had
known
nothing
of
calculations
brother
toby
a
mere
chance
said
my
uncle
then
it
adds
one
to
the
chapter
replied
my
father
the
double
success
of
my
father
repartees
tickled
off
the
pain
of
his
shin
at
once
it
was
well
it
so
fell
out
chance
again
or
the
world
to
this
day
had
never
known
the
subject
of
my
father
calculation
to
guess
it
there
was
no
chance
what
a
lucky
chapter
of
chances
has
this
turned
out
for
it
has
saved
me
the
trouble
of
writing
one
express
and
in
truth
i
have
enough
already
upon
my
hands
without
have
not
i
promised
the
world
a
chapter
of
knots
two
chapters
upon
the
right
and
the
wrong
end
of
a
woman
a
chapter
upon
whiskers
a
chapter
upon
wishes
a
chapter
of
noses
no
i
have
done
that
a
chapter
upon
my
uncle
toby
modesty
to
say
nothing
of
a
chapter
upon
chapters
which
i
will
finish
before
i
sleep
by
my
great
grandfather
whiskers
i
shall
never
get
half
of
through
this
year
take
pen
and
ink
in
hand
and
calculate
it
fairly
brother
toby
said
my
father
and
it
will
turn
out
a
million
to
one
that
of
all
the
parts
of
the
body
the
edge
of
the
forceps
should
have
the
ill
luck
just
to
fall
upon
and
break
down
that
one
part
which
should
break
down
the
fortunes
of
our
house
with
it
it
might
have
been
worse
replied
my
uncle
i
do
comprehend
said
my
suppose
the
hip
had
presented
replied
my
uncle
toby
as
slop
foreboded
my
father
reflected
half
a
minute
looked
down
touched
the
middle
of
his
forehead
slightly
with
his
finger
true
said
he
chapter
is
it
not
a
shame
to
make
two
chapters
of
what
passed
in
going
down
one
pair
of
stairs
for
we
are
got
no
farther
yet
than
to
the
first
landing
and
there
are
fifteen
more
steps
down
to
the
bottom
and
for
aught
i
know
as
my
father
and
my
uncle
toby
are
in
a
talking
humour
there
may
be
as
many
chapters
as
steps
let
that
be
as
it
will
sir
i
can
no
more
help
it
than
my
destiny
a
sudden
impulse
comes
across
me
drop
the
curtain
shandy
i
drop
it
strike
a
line
here
across
the
paper
tristram
i
strike
it
and
hey
for
a
new
chapter
the
deuce
of
any
other
rule
have
i
to
govern
myself
by
in
this
affair
and
if
i
had
one
as
i
do
all
things
out
of
all
rule
i
would
twist
it
and
tear
it
to
pieces
and
throw
it
into
the
fire
when
i
had
done
am
i
warm
i
am
and
the
cause
demands
it
a
pretty
story
is
a
man
to
follow
rules
or
rules
to
follow
him
now
this
you
must
know
being
my
chapter
upon
chapters
which
i
promised
to
write
before
i
went
to
sleep
i
thought
it
meet
to
ease
my
conscience
entirely
before
i
laid
down
by
telling
the
world
all
i
knew
about
the
matter
at
once
is
not
this
ten
times
better
than
to
set
out
dogmatically
with
a
sententious
parade
of
wisdom
and
telling
the
world
a
story
of
a
roasted
horse
that
chapters
relieve
the
mind
that
they
assist
or
impose
upon
the
imagination
and
that
in
a
work
of
this
dramatic
cast
they
are
as
necessary
as
the
shifting
of
scenes
with
fifty
other
cold
conceits
enough
to
extinguish
the
fire
which
roasted
him
o
but
to
understand
this
which
is
a
puff
at
the
fire
of
temple
you
must
read
longinus
read
away
if
you
are
not
a
jot
the
wiser
by
reading
him
the
first
time
over
never
fear
read
him
again
avicenna
and
licetus
read
aristotle
metaphysicks
forty
times
through
and
never
understood
a
single
but
mark
the
consequence
avicenna
turned
out
a
desperate
writer
at
all
kinds
of
writing
for
he
wrote
books
de
omni
scribili
and
for
licetus
fortunio
though
all
the

he
grew
to

to

upon

soul
so
much
for
my
chapter
upon
chapters
which
i
hold
to
be
the
best
chapter
in
my
whole
work
and
take
my
word
whoever
reads
it
is
full
as
well
employed

said
my
father
setting
his
foot
upon
the
first
step
from
the
this
trismegistus
continued
my
father
drawing
his
leg
back
and
turning
to
my
uncle
toby
was
the
greatest
toby
of
all
earthly
beings
he
was
the
greatest
king
the
greatest
lawgiver
the
greatest
philosopher
and
the
greatest
priest
and
engineer
said
my
uncle
toby
in
course
said
my
father
chapter
and
how
does
your
mistress
cried
my
father
taking
the
same
step
over
again
from
the
landing
and
calling
to
susannah
whom
he
saw
passing
by
the
foot
of
the
stairs
with
a
huge
in
her
hand
how
does
your
mistress
as
well
said
susannah
tripping
by
but
without
looking
up
as
can
be
what
a
fool
am
i
said
my
father
drawing
his
leg
back
again
let
things
be
as
they
will
brother
toby
is
ever
the
precise
answer
and
how
is
the
child
pray
no
answer
and
where
is
slop
added
my
father
raising
his
voice
aloud
and
looking
over
the
ballusters
susannah
was
out
of
hearing
of
all
the
riddles
of
a
married
life
said
my
father
crossing
the
landing
in
order
to
set
his
back
against
the
wall
whilst
he
propounded
it
to
my
uncle
toby
of
all
the
puzzling
riddles
said
he
in
a
marriage
state
of
which
you
may
trust
me
brother
toby
there
are
more
asses
loads
than
all
job
stock
of
asses
could
have
carried
there
is
not
one
that
has
more
intricacies
in
it
than
this
that
from
the
very
moment
the
mistress
of
the
house
is
brought
to
bed
every
female
in
it
from
my
lady
gentlewoman
down
to
the
becomes
an
inch
taller
for
it
and
give
themselves
more
airs
upon
that
single
inch
than
all
their
other
inches
put
together
i
think
rather
replied
my
uncle
toby
that
is
we
who
sink
an
inch
if
i
meet
but
a
woman
with
child
i
do
is
a
heavy
tax
upon
that
half
of
our
brother
shandy
said
my
uncle
toby
is
a
piteous
burden
upon
continued
he
shaking
his
head
yes
yes
is
a
painful
thing
said
my
father
shaking
his
head
too
but
certainly
since
shaking
of
heads
came
into
fashion
never
did
two
heads
shake
together
in
concert
from
two
such
different
springs
god
bless
deuce
take
all
said
my
uncle
toby
and
my
father
each
to
himself
chapter
holla
you
chairman
here
sixpence
do
step
into
that
shop
and
call
me
a
critick
i
am
very
willing
to
give
any
one
of
a
crown
to
help
me
with
his
tackling
to
get
my
father
and
my
uncle
toby
off
the
stairs
and
to
put
them
to
bed
is
even
high
time
for
except
a
short
nap
which
they
both
got
whilst
trim
was
boring
the
and
which
did
my
father
no
sort
of
good
upon
the
score
of
the
bad
hinge
they
have
not
else
shut
their
eyes
since
nine
hours
before
the
time
that
doctor
slop
was
led
into
the
back
parlour
in
that
dirty
pickle
by
obadiah
was
every
day
of
my
life
to
be
as
busy
a
day
as
this
and
to
take
up
truce
i
will
not
finish
that
sentence
till
i
have
made
an
observation
upon
the
strange
state
of
affairs
between
the
reader
and
myself
just
as
things
stand
at
present
an
observation
never
applicable
before
to
any
one
biographical
writer
since
the
creation
of
the
world
but
to
myself
and
i
believe
will
never
hold
good
to
any
other
until
its
final
destruction
and
therefore
for
the
very
novelty
of
it
alone
it
must
be
worth
your
worships
attending
to
i
am
this
month
one
whole
year
older
than
i
was
this
time
and
having
got
as
you
perceive
almost
into
the
middle
of
my
third
volume
according
to
the
preceding
editions
and
no
farther
than
to
my
first
day
life
is
demonstrative
that
i
have
three
hundred
and
days
more
life
to
write
just
now
than
when
i
first
set
out
so
that
instead
of
advancing
as
a
common
writer
in
my
work
with
what
i
have
been
doing
at
it
on
the
contrary
i
am
just
thrown
so
many
volumes
back
was
every
day
of
my
life
to
be
as
busy
a
day
as
this
and
why
not
and
the
transactions
and
opinions
of
it
to
take
up
as
much
description
and
for
what
reason
should
they
be
cut
short
as
at
this
rate
i
should
just
live
times
faster
than
i
should
write
it
must
follow
an
please
your
worships
that
the
more
i
write
the
more
i
shall
have
to
write
and
consequently
the
more
your
worships
read
the
more
your
worships
will
have
to
read
will
this
be
good
for
your
worships
eyes
it
will
do
well
for
mine
and
was
it
not
that
my
opinions
will
be
the
death
of
me
i
perceive
i
shall
lead
a
fine
life
of
it
out
of
this
life
of
mine
or
in
other
words
shall
lead
a
couple
of
fine
lives
together
as
for
the
proposal
of
twelve
volumes
a
year
or
a
volume
a
month
it
no
way
alters
my
prospect
write
as
i
will
and
rush
as
i
may
into
the
middle
of
things
as
horace
advises
i
shall
never
overtake
myself
whipp
and
driven
to
the
last
pinch
at
the
worst
i
shall
have
one
day
the
start
of
my
pen
and
one
day
is
enough
for
two
volumes
and
two
volumes
will
be
enough
for
one
heaven
prosper
the
manufacturers
of
paper
under
this
propitious
reign
which
is
now
opened
to
us
as
i
trust
its
providence
will
prosper
every
thing
else
in
it
that
is
taken
in
hand
as
for
the
propagation
of
geese
i
give
myself
no
concern
nature
is
i
shall
never
want
tools
to
work
with
so
then
friend
you
have
got
my
father
and
my
uncle
toby
off
the
stairs
and
seen
them
to
bed
and
how
did
you
manage
it
you
dropp
a
curtain
at
the
i
thought
you
had
no
other
way
for
it
a
crown
for
your
trouble
chapter
then
reach
me
my
breeches
off
the
chair
said
my
father
to
there
is
not
a
moment
time
to
dress
you
sir
cried
susannah
the
child
is
as
black
in
the
face
as
my
as
your
what
said
my
father
for
like
all
orators
he
was
a
dear
searcher
into
bless
me
sir
said
susannah
the
child
in
a
and
where
mr
yorick
never
where
he
should
be
said
susannah
but
his
curate
in
the
with
the
child
upon
his
arm
waiting
for
the
name
and
my
mistress
bid
me
run
as
fast
as
i
could
to
know
as
captain
shandy
is
the
godfather
whether
it
should
not
be
called
after
him
were
one
sure
said
my
father
to
himself
scratching
his
that
the
child
was
expiring
one
might
as
well
compliment
my
brother
toby
as
not
and
it
would
be
a
pity
in
such
a
case
to
throw
away
so
great
a
name
as
trismegistus
upon
him
but
he
may
recover
no
no
said
my
father
to
susannah
i
get
up
there
is
no
time
cried
susannah
the
child
as
black
as
my
shoe
trismegistus
said
my
father
but
stay
thou
art
a
leaky
vessel
susannah
added
my
father
canst
thou
carry
trismegistus
in
thy
head
the
length
of
the
gallery
without
scattering
can
i
cried
susannah
shutting
the
door
in
a
if
she
can
i
be
shot
said
my
father
bouncing
out
of
bed
in
the
dark
and
groping
for
his
breeches
susannah
ran
with
all
speed
along
the
gallery
my
father
made
all
possible
speed
to
find
his
breeches
susannah
got
the
start
and
kept
it
is
tris
something
cried
susannah
there
is
no
in
the
world
said
the
curate
beginning
with
tris
but
tristram
then
is
quoth
susannah
there
is
no
gistus
to
it
noodle
is
my
own
name
replied
the
curate
dipping
his
hand
as
he
spoke
into
the
bason
tristram
said
he
so
tristram
was
i
called
and
tristram
shall
i
be
to
the
day
of
my
death
my
father
followed
susannah
with
his
across
his
arm
with
nothing
more
than
his
breeches
on
fastened
through
haste
with
but
a
single
button
and
that
button
through
haste
thrust
only
half
into
the
she
has
not
forgot
the
name
cried
my
father
half
opening
the
door
no
no
said
the
curate
with
a
tone
of
and
the
child
is
better
cried
and
how
does
your
mistress
as
well
said
susannah
as
can
be
pish
said
my
father
the
button
of
his
breeches
slipping
out
of
the
so
that
whether
the
interjection
was
levelled
at
susannah
or
the
whether
pish
was
an
interjection
of
contempt
or
an
interjection
of
modesty
is
a
doubt
and
must
be
a
doubt
till
i
shall
have
time
to
write
the
three
following
favourite
chapters
that
is
my
chapter
of
my
chapter
of
pishes
and
my
chapter
of
all
the
light
i
am
able
to
give
the
reader
at
present
is
this
that
the
moment
my
father
cried
pish
he
whisk
himself
about
and
with
his
breeches
held
up
by
one
hand
and
his
thrown
across
the
arm
of
the
other
he
turned
along
the
gallery
to
bed
something
slower
than
he
came
chapter
i
wish
i
could
write
a
chapter
upon
sleep
a
fitter
occasion
could
never
have
presented
itself
than
what
this
moment
offers
when
all
the
curtains
of
the
family
are
drawn
the
candles
put
out
and
no
creature
eyes
are
open
but
a
single
one
for
the
other
has
been
shut
these
twenty
years
of
my
mother
nurse
it
is
a
fine
subject
and
yet
as
fine
as
it
is
i
would
undertake
to
write
a
dozen
chapters
upon
both
quicker
and
with
more
fame
than
a
single
chapter
upon
this
there
is
something
lively
in
the
very
idea
of
and
trust
me
when
i
get
amongst
you
gentry
with
great
beards
look
as
grave
as
you
will
i
make
merry
work
with
my
i
shall
have
all
to
myself
is
a
maiden
subject
i
shall
run
foul
of
no
man
wisdom
or
fine
sayings
in
it
but
for
sleep
i
know
i
shall
make
nothing
of
it
before
i
begin
i
am
no
dab
at
your
fine
sayings
in
the
first
place
and
in
the
next
i
can
not
for
my
soul
set
a
grave
face
upon
a
bad
matter
and
tell
the
world
is
the
refuge
of
the
unfortunate
the
enfranchisement
of
the
prisoner
the
downy
lap
of
the
hopeless
the
weary
and
the
nor
could
i
set
out
with
a
lye
in
my
mouth
by
affirming
that
of
all
the
soft
and
delicious
functions
of
our
nature
by
which
the
great
author
of
it
in
his
bounty
has
been
pleased
to
recompence
the
sufferings
wherewith
his
justice
and
his
good
pleasure
has
wearied
us
that
this
is
the
chiefest
i
know
pleasures
worth
ten
of
it
or
what
a
happiness
it
is
to
man
when
the
anxieties
and
passions
of
the
day
are
over
and
he
lies
down
upon
his
back
that
his
soul
shall
be
so
seated
within
him
that
whichever
way
she
turns
her
eyes
the
heavens
shall
look
calm
and
sweet
above
her
no
desire
or
fear
or
doubt
that
troubles
the
air
nor
any
difficulty
past
present
or
to
come
that
the
imagination
may
not
pass
over
without
offence
in
that
sweet
secession
blessing
said
sancho
panca
upon
the
man
who
first
invented
this
thing
called
sleep
it
covers
a
man
all
over
like
a
cloak
now
there
is
more
to
me
in
this
and
it
speaks
warmer
to
my
heart
and
affections
than
all
the
dissertations
squeez
out
of
the
heads
of
the
learned
together
upon
the
subject
not
that
i
altogether
disapprove
of
what
montaigne
advances
upon
it
is
admirable
in
its
way
i
quote
by
memory
the
world
enjoys
other
pleasures
says
he
as
they
do
that
of
sleep
without
tasting
or
feeling
it
as
it
slips
and
passes
we
should
study
and
ruminate
upon
it
in
order
to
render
proper
thanks
to
him
who
grants
it
to
for
this
end
i
cause
myself
to
be
disturbed
in
my
sleep
that
i
may
the
better
and
more
sensibly
relish
and
yet
i
see
few
says
he
again
who
live
with
less
sleep
when
need
requires
my
body
is
capable
of
a
firm
but
not
of
a
violent
and
sudden
agitation
i
evade
of
late
all
violent
exercises
i
am
never
weary
with
walking
but
from
my
youth
i
never
looked
to
ride
upon
pavements
i
love
to
lie
hard
and
alone
and
even
without
my
wife
this
last
word
may
stagger
the
faith
of
the
world
but
remember
vraisemblance
as
bayle
says
in
the
affair
of
liceti
pas
toujours
du
cote
de
la
verite
and
so
much
for
sleep
chapter
if
my
wife
will
but
venture
him
brother
toby
trismegistus
shall
be
dress
and
brought
down
to
us
whilst
you
and
i
are
getting
our
breakfasts
go
tell
susannah
obadiah
to
step
here
she
is
run
up
stairs
answered
obadiah
this
very
instant
sobbing
and
crying
and
wringing
her
hands
as
if
her
heart
would
break
we
shall
have
a
rare
month
of
it
said
my
father
turning
his
head
from
obadiah
and
looking
wistfully
in
my
uncle
toby
face
for
some
time
we
shall
have
a
devilish
month
of
it
brother
toby
said
my
father
setting
his
arms
and
shaking
his
head
fire
water
women
wind
brother
toby
is
some
misfortune
quoth
my
uncle
that
it
is
cried
my
father
to
have
so
many
jarring
elements
breaking
loose
and
riding
triumph
in
every
corner
of
a
gentleman
house
little
boots
it
to
the
peace
of
a
family
brother
toby
that
you
and
i
possess
ourselves
and
sit
here
silent
and
unmoved
whilst
such
a
storm
is
whistling
over
our
and
what
the
matter
susannah
they
have
called
the
child
tristram
and
my
mistress
is
just
got
out
of
an
hysterick
fit
about
it
no
is
not
my
fault
said
susannah
i
told
him
it
was
make
tea
for
yourself
brother
toby
said
my
father
taking
down
his
hat
but
how
different
from
the
sallies
and
agitations
of
voice
and
members
which
a
common
reader
would
imagine
for
he
spake
in
the
sweetest
modulation
and
took
down
his
hat
with
the
genteelest
movement
of
limbs
that
ever
affliction
harmonized
and
attuned
together
go
to
the
for
corporal
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
speaking
to
obadiah
as
soon
as
my
father
left
the
room
chapter
when
the
misfortune
of
my
nose
fell
so
heavily
upon
my
head
the
reader
remembers
that
he
walked
instantly
up
stairs
and
cast
himself
down
upon
his
bed
and
from
hence
unless
he
has
a
great
insight
into
human
nature
he
will
be
apt
to
expect
a
rotation
of
the
same
ascending
and
descending
movements
from
him
upon
this
misfortune
of
my
name
no
the
different
weight
dear
sir
nay
even
the
different
package
of
two
vexations
of
the
same
weight
makes
a
very
wide
difference
in
our
manner
of
bearing
and
getting
through
with
it
is
not
half
an
hour
ago
when
in
the
great
hurry
and
precipitation
of
a
poor
devil
writing
for
daily
bread
i
threw
a
fair
sheet
which
i
had
just
finished
and
carefully
wrote
out
slap
into
the
fire
instead
of
the
foul
one
instantly
i
snatch
off
my
wig
and
threw
it
perpendicularly
with
all
imaginable
violence
up
to
the
top
of
the
room
indeed
i
caught
it
as
it
fell
but
there
was
an
end
of
the
matter
nor
do
i
think
any
think
else
in
nature
would
have
given
such
immediate
ease
she
dear
goddess
by
an
instantaneous
impulse
in
all
provoking
cases
determines
us
to
a
sally
of
this
or
that
member
or
else
she
thrusts
us
into
this
or
that
place
or
posture
of
body
we
know
not
why
but
mark
madam
we
live
amongst
riddles
and
mysteries
the
most
obvious
things
which
come
in
our
way
have
dark
sides
which
the
quickest
sight
can
not
penetrate
into
and
even
the
clearest
and
most
exalted
understandings
amongst
us
find
ourselves
puzzled
and
at
a
loss
in
almost
every
cranny
of
works
so
that
this
like
a
thousand
other
things
falls
out
for
us
in
a
way
which
tho
we
can
not
reason
upon
it
yet
we
find
the
good
of
it
may
it
please
your
reverences
and
your
worships
and
that
enough
for
us
now
my
father
could
not
lie
down
with
this
affliction
for
his
life
nor
could
he
carry
it
up
stairs
like
the
other
he
walked
composedly
out
with
it
to
the
had
my
father
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
reasoned
an
hour
which
way
to
have
gone
reason
with
all
her
force
could
not
have
directed
him
to
any
think
like
it
there
is
something
sir
in
but
what
it
is
i
leave
to
and
betwixt
to
find
out
but
there
is
something
under
the
first
disorderly
transport
of
the
humours
so
unaccountably
becalming
in
an
orderly
and
a
sober
walk
towards
one
of
them
that
i
have
often
wondered
that
neither
pythagoras
nor
plato
nor
solon
nor
lycurgus
nor
mahomet
nor
any
one
of
your
noted
lawgivers
ever
gave
order
about
them
chapter
your
honour
said
trim
shutting
the
before
he
began
to
speak
has
heard
i
imagine
of
this
unlucky
accident
o
yes
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
and
it
gives
me
great
i
am
heartily
concerned
too
but
i
hope
your
honour
replied
trim
will
do
me
the
justice
to
believe
that
it
was
not
in
the
least
owing
to
to
thee
trim
cried
my
uncle
toby
looking
kindly
in
his
face
was
susannah
and
the
curate
folly
betwixt
what
business
could
they
have
together
an
please
your
honour
in
the
garden
in
the
gallery
thou
meanest
replied
my
uncle
toby
trim
found
he
was
upon
a
wrong
scent
and
stopped
short
with
a
low
bow
two
misfortunes
quoth
the
corporal
to
himself
are
twice
as
many
at
least
as
are
needful
to
be
talked
over
at
one
time
the
mischief
the
cow
has
done
in
breaking
into
the
fortifications
may
be
told
his
honour
trim
casuistry
and
address
under
the
cover
of
his
low
bow
prevented
all
suspicion
in
my
uncle
toby
so
he
went
on
with
what
he
had
to
say
to
trim
as
follows
for
my
own
part
trim
though
i
can
see
little
or
no
difference
betwixt
my
nephew
being
called
tristram
or
trismegistus
yet
as
the
thing
sits
so
near
my
brother
heart
trim
i
would
freely
have
given
a
hundred
pounds
rather
than
it
should
have
a
hundred
pounds
an
please
your
honour
replied
trim
i
would
not
give
a
to
nor
would
i
trim
upon
my
own
account
quoth
my
uncle
toby
but
my
brother
whom
there
is
no
arguing
with
in
this
case
maintains
that
a
great
deal
more
depends
trim
upon
than
what
ignorant
people
imagine
for
he
says
there
never
was
a
great
or
heroic
action
performed
since
the
world
began
by
one
called
tristram
nay
he
will
have
it
trim
that
a
man
can
neither
be
learned
or
wise
or
is
all
fancy
an
please
your
honour
i
fought
just
as
well
replied
the
corporal
when
the
regiment
called
me
trim
as
when
they
called
me
james
and
for
my
own
part
said
my
uncle
toby
though
i
should
blush
to
boast
of
myself
trim
yet
had
my
name
been
alexander
i
could
have
done
no
more
at
namur
than
my
bless
your
honour
cried
trim
advancing
three
steps
as
he
spoke
does
a
man
think
of
his
when
he
goes
upon
the
attack
or
when
he
stands
in
the
trench
trim
cried
my
uncle
toby
looking
or
when
he
enters
a
breach
said
trim
pushing
in
between
two
or
forces
the
lines
cried
my
uncle
rising
up
and
pushing
his
crutch
like
a
or
facing
a
platoon
cried
trim
presenting
his
stick
like
a
or
when
he
marches
up
the
glacis
cried
my
uncle
toby
looking
warm
and
setting
his
foot
upon
his
chapter
my
father
was
returned
from
his
walk
to
the
and
opened
the
in
the
very
height
of
the
attack
just
as
my
uncle
toby
was
marching
up
the
glacis
trim
recovered
his
arms
never
was
my
uncle
toby
caught
in
riding
at
such
a
desperate
rate
in
his
life
alas
my
uncle
toby
had
not
a
weightier
matter
called
forth
all
the
ready
eloquence
of
my
father
how
hadst
thou
then
and
thy
poor
too
been
insulted
my
father
hung
up
his
hat
with
the
same
air
he
took
it
down
and
after
giving
a
slight
look
at
the
disorder
of
the
room
he
took
hold
of
one
of
the
chairs
which
had
formed
the
corporal
breach
and
placing
it
my
uncle
toby
he
sat
down
in
it
and
as
soon
as
the
were
taken
away
and
the
door
shut
he
broke
out
in
a
lamentation
as
follows
my
father
lamentation
it
is
in
vain
longer
said
my
father
addressing
himself
as
much
to
ernulphus
curse
which
was
laid
upon
the
corner
of
the
as
to
my
uncle
toby
who
sat
under
it
it
is
in
vain
longer
said
my
father
in
the
most
querulous
monotony
imaginable
to
struggle
as
i
have
done
against
this
most
uncomfortable
of
human
persuasions
i
see
it
plainly
that
either
for
my
own
sins
brother
toby
or
the
sins
and
follies
of
the
shandy
family
heaven
has
thought
fit
to
draw
forth
the
heaviest
of
its
artillery
against
me
and
that
the
prosperity
of
my
child
is
the
point
upon
which
the
whole
force
of
it
is
directed
to
such
a
thing
would
batter
the
whole
universe
about
our
ears
brother
shandy
said
my
uncle
toby
if
it
was
tristram
child
of
wrath
child
of
decrepitude
interruption
mistake
and
discontent
what
one
misfortune
or
disaster
in
the
book
of
embryotic
evils
that
could
unmechanize
thy
frame
or
entangle
thy
filaments
which
has
not
fallen
upon
thy
head
or
ever
thou
camest
into
the
world
what
evils
in
thy
passage
into
it
what
evils
since
produced
into
being
in
the
decline
of
thy
father
days
when
the
powers
of
his
imagination
and
of
his
body
were
waxing
feeble
when
radical
heat
and
radical
moisture
the
elements
which
should
have
temper
thine
were
drying
up
and
nothing
left
to
found
thy
stamina
in
but
negations
is
pitiful
brother
toby
at
the
best
and
called
out
for
all
the
little
helps
that
care
and
attention
on
both
sides
could
give
it
but
how
were
we
defeated
you
know
the
event
brother
toby
is
too
melancholy
a
one
to
be
repeated
now
when
the
few
animal
spirits
i
was
worth
in
the
world
and
with
which
memory
fancy
and
quick
parts
should
have
been
convey
were
all
dispersed
confused
confounded
scattered
and
sent
to
the
here
then
was
the
time
to
have
put
a
stop
to
this
persecution
against
him
and
tried
an
experiment
at
least
whether
calmness
and
serenity
of
mind
in
your
sister
with
a
due
attention
brother
toby
to
her
evacuations
and
repletions
and
the
rest
of
her
might
not
in
a
course
of
nine
months
gestation
have
set
all
things
to
my
child
was
bereft
of
these
what
a
teazing
life
did
she
lead
herself
and
consequently
her
foetus
too
with
that
nonsensical
anxiety
of
hers
about
in
town
i
thought
my
sister
submitted
with
the
greatest
patience
replied
my
uncle
toby
i
never
heard
her
utter
one
fretful
word
about
she
fumed
inwardly
cried
my
father
and
that
let
me
tell
you
brother
was
ten
times
worse
for
the
child
and
then
what
battles
did
she
fight
with
me
and
what
perpetual
storms
about
the
there
she
gave
vent
said
my
uncle
vent
cried
my
father
looking
up
but
what
was
all
this
my
dear
toby
to
the
injuries
done
us
by
my
child
coming
head
foremost
into
the
world
when
all
i
wished
in
this
general
wreck
of
his
frame
was
to
have
saved
this
little
casket
unbroke
with
all
my
precautions
how
was
my
system
turned
in
the
womb
with
my
child
his
head
exposed
to
the
hand
of
violence
and
a
pressure
of
pounds
avoirdupois
weight
acting
so
perpendicularly
upon
its
apex
that
at
this
hour
is
ninety
per

insurance
that
the
fine
of
the
intellectual
web
be
not

torn

a

at

striking

down

according

standing
with

with

in

to
tell

and
what
in
it
you
shall
hear
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
as
francis
the
first
of
france
was
one
winterly
night
warming
himself
over
the
embers
of
a
wood
fire
and
talking
with
his
first
minister
of
sundry
things
for
the
good
of
the
state
vide
menagiana
vol
i
it
would
not
be
amiss
said
the
king
stirring
up
the
embers
with
his
cane
if
this
good
understanding
betwixt
ourselves
and
switzerland
was
a
little
there
is
no
end
sire
replied
the
minister
in
giving
money
to
these
people
they
would
swallow
up
the
treasury
of
poo
poo
answered
the
king
there
are
more
ways
mons
le
premier
of
bribing
states
besides
that
of
giving
money
i
pay
switzerland
the
honour
of
standing
godfather
for
my
next
your
majesty
said
the
minister
in
so
doing
would
have
all
the
grammarians
in
europe
upon
your
back
switzerland
as
a
republic
being
a
female
can
in
no
construction
be
she
may
be
godmother
replied
francis
hastily
so
announce
my
intentions
by
a
courier
morning
i
am
astonished
said
francis
the
first
that
day
fortnight
speaking
to
his
minister
as
he
entered
the
closet
that
we
have
had
no
answer
from
sire
i
wait
upon
you
this
moment
said
mons
le
premier
to
lay
before
you
my
dispatches
upon
that
they
take
it
kindly
said
the
they
do
sire
replied
the
minister
and
have
the
highest
sense
of
the
honour
your
majesty
has
done
them
but
the
republick
as
godmother
claims
her
right
in
this
case
of
naming
the
child
in
all
reason
quoth
the
king
she
will
christen
him
francis
or
henry
or
lewis
or
some
name
that
she
knows
will
be
agreeable
to
us
your
majesty
is
deceived
replied
the
minister
i
have
this
hour
received
a
dispatch
from
our
resident
with
the
determination
of
the
republic
on
that
point
and
what
name
has
the
republick
fixed
upon
for
the
dauphin
shadrach
mesech
replied
the
by
saint
peter
girdle
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
swiss
cried
francis
the
first
pulling
up
his
breeches
and
walking
hastily
across
the
floor
your
majesty
replied
the
minister
calmly
can
not
bring
yourself
off
we
pay
them
in
money
said
the
king
sire
there
are
not
sixty
thousand
crowns
in
the
treasury
answered
the
i
pawn
the
best
jewel
in
my
crown
quoth
francis
the
first
your
honour
stands
pawn
already
in
this
matter
answered
monsieur
le
premier
then
mons
le
premier
said
the
king
by
we
go
to
war
with
chapter
albeit
gentle
reader
i
have
lusted
earnestly
and
endeavoured
carefully
according
to
the
measure
of
such
a
slender
skill
as
god
has
vouchsafed
me
and
as
convenient
leisure
from
other
occasions
of
needful
profit
and
healthful
pastime
have
permitted
that
these
little
books
which
i
here
put
into
thy
hands
might
stand
instead
of
many
bigger
books
yet
have
i
carried
myself
towards
thee
in
such
fanciful
guise
of
careless
disport
that
right
sore
am
i
ashamed
now
to
intreat
thy
lenity
seriously
in
beseeching
thee
to
believe
it
of
me
that
in
the
story
of
my
father
and
his
i
have
no
thoughts
of
treading
upon
francis
the
first
nor
in
the
affair
of
the
nose
upon
francis
the
ninth
nor
in
the
character
of
my
uncle
toby
of
characterizing
the
militiating
spirits
of
my
country
the
wound
upon
his
groin
is
a
wound
to
every
comparison
of
that
kind
nor
by
trim
that
i
meant
the
duke
of
ormond
or
that
my
book
is
wrote
against
predestination
or
or
taxes
if
is
wrote
against
any
thing
is
wrote
an
please
your
worships
against
the
spleen
in
order
by
a
more
frequent
and
a
more
convulsive
elevation
and
depression
of
the
diaphragm
and
the
succussations
of
the
intercostal
and
abdominal
muscles
in
laughter
to
drive
the
gall
and
other
bitter
juices
from
the
liver
and
of
his
majesty
subjects
with
all
the
inimicitious
passions
which
belong
to
them
down
into
their
duodenums
chapter
but
can
the
thing
be
undone
yorick
said
my
father
for
in
my
opinion
continued
he
it
can
not
i
am
a
vile
canonist
replied
yorick
but
of
all
evils
holding
suspence
to
be
the
most
tormenting
we
shall
at
least
know
the
worst
of
this
matter
i
hate
these
great
dinners
said
my
father
the
size
of
the
dinner
is
not
the
point
answered
yorick
we
want
shandy
to
dive
into
the
bottom
of
this
doubt
whether
the
name
can
be
changed
or
not
and
as
the
beards
of
so
many
commissaries
officials
advocates
proctors
registers
and
of
the
most
eminent
of
our
and
others
are
all
to
meet
in
the
middle
of
one
table
and
didius
has
so
pressingly
invited
you
who
in
your
distress
would
miss
such
an
occasion
all
that
is
requisite
continued
yorick
is
to
apprize
didius
and
let
him
manage
a
conversation
after
dinner
so
as
to
introduce
the
then
my
brother
toby
cried
my
father
clapping
his
two
hands
together
shall
go
with
us
let
my
old
quoth
my
uncle

and
my
laced
regimentals
be
hung
to
the
fire
all
night
trim
page
numbering
skips
ten
pages
chapter
no
doubt
sir
there
is
a
whole
chapter
wanting
here
and
a
chasm
of
ten
pages
made
in
the
book
by
it
but
the
is
neither
a
fool
or
a
knave
or
a
puppy
nor
is
the
book
a
jot
more
imperfect
at
least
upon
that
score
but
on
the
contrary
the
book
is
more
perfect
and
complete
by
wanting
the
chapter
than
having
it
as
i
shall
demonstrate
to
your
reverences
in
this
i
question
first
whether
the
same
experiment
might
not
be
made
as
successfully
upon
sundry
other
chapters
but
there
is
no
end
an
please
your
reverences
in
trying
experiments
upon
chapters
we
have
had
enough
of
it
so
there
an
end
of
that
matter
but
before
i
begin
my
demonstration
let
me
only
tell
you
that
the
chapter
which
i
have
torn
out
and
which
otherwise
you
would
all
have
been
reading
just
now
instead
of
this
was
the
description
of
my
father
my
uncle
toby
trim
and
obadiah
setting
out
and
journeying
to
the
visitation
at
we
go
in
the
coach
said
my
father
prithee
have
the
arms
been
altered
obadiah
it
would
have
made
my
story
much
better
to
have
begun
with
telling
you
that
at
the
time
my
mother
arms
were
added
to
the
shandy
when
the
coach
was
upon
my
father
marriage
it
had
so
fallen
out
that
the
whether
by
performing
all
his
works
with
the
left
hand
like
turpilius
the
roman
or
hans
holbein
of
basil
or
whether
was
more
from
the
blunder
of
his
head
than
hand
or
whether
lastly
it
was
from
the
sinister
turn
which
every
thing
relating
to
our
family
was
apt
to
take
it
so
fell
out
however
to
our
reproach
that
instead
of
the
which
since
harry
the
eighth
reign
was
honestly
our
due
a
by
some
of
these
fatalities
had
been
drawn
quite
across
the
field
of
the
shandy
arms
is
scarce
credible
that
the
mind
of
so
wise
a
man
as
my
father
was
could
be
so
much
incommoded
with
so
small
a
matter
the
word
coach
let
it
be
whose
it
would
or
or
or
could
never
be
named
in
the
family
but
he
constantly
complained
of
carrying
this
vile
mark
of
illegitimacy
upon
the
door
of
his
own
he
never
once
was
able
to
step
into
the
coach
or
out
of
it
without
turning
round
to
take
a
view
of
the
arms
and
making
a
vow
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
the
last
time
he
would
ever
set
his
foot
in
it
again
till
the
was
taken
out
but
like
the
affair
of
the
hinge
it
was
one
of
the
many
things
which
the
destinies
had
set
down
in
their
books
ever
to
be
grumbled
at
and
in
wiser
families
than
ours
but
never
to
be
mended
has
the
been
brush
out
i
say
said
my
there
has
been
nothing
brush
out
sir
answered
obadiah
but
the
lining
we
go
said
my
father
turning
to
yorick
of
all
things
in
the
world
except
politicks
the
clergy
know
the
least
of
heraldry
said
no
matter
for
that
cried
my
father
i
should
be
sorry
to
appear
with
a
blot
in
my
escutcheon
before
never
mind
the
said
my
uncle
toby
putting
on
his
no
indeed
said
my
father
you
may
go
with
my
aunt
dinah
to
a
visitation
with
a
if
you
think
fit
my
poor
uncle
toby
blush
my
father
was
vexed
at
no
my
dear
brother
toby
said
my
father
changing
his
tone
but
the
damp
of
the
about
my
loins
may
give
me
the
sciatica
again
as
it
did
december
january
and
february
last
winter
so
if
you
please
you
shall
ride
my
wife
pad
and
as
you
are
to
preach
yorick
you
had
better
make
the
best
of
your
way
before
and
leave
me
to
take
care
of
my
brother
toby
and
to
follow
at
our
own
rates
now
the
chapter
i
was
obliged
to
tear
out
was
the
description
of
this
cavalcade
in
which
corporal
trim
and
obadiah
upon
two
led
the
way
as
slow
as
a
patrole
whilst
my
uncle
toby
in
his
laced
regimentals
and
kept
his
rank
with
my
father
in
deep
roads
and
dissertations
alternately
upon
the
advantage
of
learning
and
arms
as
each
could
get
the
start
but
the
painting
of
this
journey
upon
reviewing
it
appears
to
be
so
much
above
the
stile
and
manner
of
any
thing
else
i
have
been
able
to
paint
in
this
book
that
it
could
not
have
remained
in
it
without
depreciating
every
other
scene
and
destroying
at
the
same
time
that
necessary
equipoise
and
balance
whether
of
good
or
bad
betwixt
chapter
and
chapter
from
whence
the
just
proportions
and
harmony
of
the
whole
work
results
for
my
own
part
i
am
but
just
set
up
in
the
business
so
know
little
about
it
but
in
my
opinion
to
write
a
book
is
for
all
the
world
like
humming
a
song
be
but
in
tune
with
yourself
madam
is
no
matter
how
high
or
how
low
you
take
it
this
is
the
reason
may
it
please
your
reverences
that
some
of
the
lowest
and
flattest
compositions
pass
off
very
well
as
yorick
told
my
uncle
toby
one
night
by
my
uncle
toby
looked
brisk
at
the
sound
of
the
word
siege
but
could
make
neither
head
or
tail
of
it
i
to
preach
at
court
next
sunday
said
homenas
run
over
my
notes
so
i
humm
over
doctor
homenas
notes
the
modulation
very
well
do
homenas
if
it
holds
on
at
this
rate
so
on
i
humm
and
a
tolerable
tune
i
thought
it
was
and
to
this
hour
may
it
please
your
reverences
had
never
found
out
how
low
how
flat
how
spiritless
and
jejune
it
was
but
that
all
of
a
sudden
up
started
an
air
in
the
middle
of
it
so
fine
so
rich
so
heavenly
it
carried
my
soul
up
with
it
into
the
other
world
now
had
i
as
montaigne
complained
in
a
parallel
accident
had
i
found
the
declivity
easy
or
the
ascent
accessible
certes
i
had
been
your
notes
homenas
i
should
have
said
are
good
notes
but
it
was
so
perpendicular
a
precipice
so
wholly
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
work
that
by
the
first
note
i
humm
i
found
myself
flying
into
the
other
world
and
from
thence
discovered
the
vale
from
whence
i
came
so
deep
so
low
and
dismal
that
i
shall
never
have
the
heart
to
descend
into
it
again
a
dwarf
who
brings
a
standard
along
with
him
to
measure
his
own
size
take
my
word
is
a
dwarf
in
more
articles
than
and
so
much
for
tearing
out
of
chapters
chapter
see
if
he
is
not
cutting
it
into
slips
and
giving
them
about
him
to
light
their
pipes
is
abominable
answered
didius
it
should
not
go
unnoticed
said
doctor
kysarcius
he
was
of
the
kysarcii
of
the
low
countries
methinks
said
didius
half
rising
from
his
chair
in
order
to
remove
a
bottle
and
a
tall
decanter
which
stood
in
a
direct
line
betwixt
him
and
yorick
you
might
have
spared
this
sarcastic
stroke
and
have
hit
upon
a
more
proper
place
yorick
or
at
least
upon
a
more
proper
occasion
to
have
shewn
your
contempt
of
what
we
have
been
about
if
the
sermon
is
of
no
better
worth
than
to
light
pipes
with
was
certainly
sir
not
good
enough
to
be
preached
before
so
learned
a
body
and
if
was
good
enough
to
be
preached
before
so
learned
a
body
was
certainly
sir
too
good
to
light
their
pipes
with
afterwards
i
have
got
him
fast
hung
up
quoth
didius
to
himself
upon
one
of
the
two
horns
of
my
dilemma
let
him
get
off
as
he
can
i
have
undergone
such
unspeakable
torments
in
bringing
forth
this
sermon
quoth
yorick
upon
this
occasion
that
i
declare
didius
i
would
suffer
martyrdom
and
if
it
was
possible
my
horse
with
me
a
thousand
times
over
before
i
would
sit
down
and
make
such
another
i
was
delivered
of
it
at
the
wrong
end
of
me
it
came
from
my
head
instead
of
my
heart
and
it
is
for
the
pain
it
gave
me
both
in
the
writing
and
preaching
of
it
that
i
revenge
myself
of
it
in
this
manner
to
preach
to
shew
the
extent
of
our
reading
or
the
subtleties
of
our
wit
to
parade
in
the
eyes
of
the
vulgar
with
the
beggarly
accounts
of
a
little
learning
tinsel
over
with
a
few
words
which
glitter
but
convey
little
light
and
less
warmth
is
a
dishonest
use
of
the
poor
single
half
hour
in
a
week
which
is
put
into
our
hands
is
not
preaching
the
gospel
but
ourselves
for
my
own
part
continued
yorick
i
had
rather
direct
five
words
to
the
as
yorick
pronounced
the
word
my
uncle
toby
rose
up
to
say
something
upon
projectiles
when
a
single
word
and
no
more
uttered
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
drew
every
one
ears
towards
it
a
word
of
all
others
in
the
dictionary
the
last
in
that
place
to
be
expected
a
word
i
am
ashamed
to
write

i
tell
it
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
zounds
z
ds
cried
phutatorius
partly
to
himself
and
yet
high
enough
to
be
heard
and
what
seemed
odd
was
uttered
in
a
construction
of
look
and
in
a
tone
of
voice
somewhat
between
that
of
a
man
in
amazement
and
one
in
bodily
pain
one
or
two
who
had
very
nice
ears
and
could
distinguish
the
expression
and
mixture
of
the
two
tones
as
plainly
as
a
third
or
a
fifth
or
any
other
chord
in
musick
were
the
most
puzzled
and
perplexed
with
it
the
concord
was
good
in
itself
but
then
was
quite
out
of
the
key
and
no
way
applicable
to
the
subject
started
so
that
with
all
their
knowledge
they
could
not
tell
what
in
the
world
to
make
of
it
others
who
knew
nothing
of
musical
expression
and
merely
lent
their
ears
to
the
plain
import
of
the
word
imagined
that
phutatorius
who
was
somewhat
of
a
cholerick
spirit
was
just
going
to
snatch
the
cudgels
out
of
didius
hands
in
order
to
bemaul
yorick
to
some
purpose
and
that
the
desperate
monosyllable
z
ds
was
the
exordium
to
an
oration
which
as
they
judged
from
the
sample
presaged
but
a
rough
kind
of
handling
of
him
so
that
my
uncle
toby
felt
a
pang
for
what
yorick
was
about
to
undergo
but
seeing
phutatorius
stop
short
without
any
attempt
or
desire
to
go
on
a
third
party
began
to
suppose
that
it
was
no
more
than
an
involuntary
respiration
casually
forming
itself
into
the
shape
of
a
oath
without
the
sin
or
substance
of
one
others
and
especially
one
or
two
who
sat
next
him
looked
upon
it
on
the
contrary
as
a
real
and
substantial
oath
propensly
formed
against
yorick
to
whom
he
was
known
to
bear
no
good
liking
which
said
oath
as
my
father
philosophized
upon
it
actually
lay
fretting
and
fuming
at
that
very
time
in
the
upper
regions
of
phutatorius
purtenance
and
so
was
naturally
and
according
to
the
due
course
of
things
first
squeezed
out
by
the
sudden
influx
of
blood
which
was
driven
into
the
right
ventricle
of
phutatorius
heart
by
the
stroke
of
surprize
which
so
strange
a
theory
of
preaching
had
excited
how
finely
we
argue
upon
mistaken
facts
there
was
not
a
soul
busied
in
all
these
various
reasonings
upon
the
monosyllable
which
phutatorius
uttered
who
did
not
take
this
for
granted
proceeding
upon
it
as
from
an
axiom
namely
that
mind
was
intent
upon
the
subject
of
debate
which
was
arising
between
didius
and
yorick
and
indeed
as
he
looked
first
towards
the
one
and
then
towards
the
other
with
the
air
of
a
man
listening
to
what
was
going
forwards
who
would
not
have
thought
the
same
but
the
truth
was
that
phutatorius
knew
not
one
word
or
one
syllable
of
what
was
passing
but
his
whole
thoughts
and
attention
were
taken
up
with
a
transaction
which
was
going
forwards
at
that
very
instant
within
the
precincts
of
his
own
galligaskins
and
in
a
part
of
them
where
of
all
others
he
stood
most
interested
to
watch
accidents
so
that
notwithstanding
he
looked
with
all
the
attention
in
the
world
and
had
gradually
skrewed
up
every
nerve
and
muscle
in
his
face
to
the
utmost
pitch
the
instrument
would
bear
in
order
as
it
was
thought
to
give
a
sharp
reply
to
yorick
who
sat
him
yet
i
say
was
yorick
never
once
in
any
one
domicile
of
phutatorius
brain
but
the
true
cause
of
his
exclamation
lay
at
least
a
yard
below
this
i
will
endeavour
to
explain
to
you
with
all
imaginable
decency
you
must
be
informed
then
that
gastripheres
who
had
taken
a
turn
into
the
kitchen
a
little
before
dinner
to
see
how
things
went
on
observing
a
of
fine
chesnuts
standing
upon
the
dresser
had
ordered
that
a
hundred
or
two
of
them
might
be
roasted
and
sent
in
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
gastripheres
inforcing
his
orders
about
them
that
didius
but
phutatorius
especially
were
particularly
fond
of
about
two
minutes
before
the
time
that
my
uncle
toby
interrupted
yorick
harangue
gastripheres
chesnuts
were
brought
in
and
as
phutatorius
fondness
for
was
uppermost
in
the
waiter
head
he
laid
them
directly
before
phutatorius
wrapt
up
hot
in
a
clean
damask
napkin
now
whether
it
was
physically
impossible
with
half
a
dozen
hands
all
thrust
into
the
napkin
at
a
time
but
that
some
one
chesnut
of
more
life
and
rotundity
than
the
rest
must
be
put
in
motion
it
so
fell
out
however
that
one
was
actually
sent
rolling
off
the
table
and
as
phutatorius
sat
straddling
under
it
fell
perpendicularly
into
that
particular
aperture
of
phutatorius
breeches
for
which
to
the
shame
and
indelicacy
of
our
language
be
it
spoke
there
is
no
chaste
word
throughout
all
johnson
dictionary
let
it
suffice
to
say
it
was
that
particular
aperture
which
in
all
good
societies
the
laws
of
decorum
do
strictly
require
like
the
temple
of
janus
in
peace
at
least
to
be
universally
shut
up
the
neglect
of
this
punctilio
in
phutatorius
which
should
be
a
warning
to
all
mankind
had
opened
a
door
to
this
accident
i
call
it
in
compliance
to
a
received
mode
of
speaking
but
in
no
opposition
to
the
opinion
either
of
acrites
or
mythogeras
in
this
matter
i
know
they
were
both
prepossessed
and
fully
persuaded
of
it
and
are
so
to
this
hour
that
there
was
nothing
of
accident
in
the
whole
event
but
that
the
chesnut
taking
that
particular
course
and
in
a
manner
of
its
own
accord
and
then
falling
with
all
its
heat
directly
into
that
one
particular
place
and
no
other
was
a
real
judgment
upon
phutatorius
for
that
filthy
and
obscene
treatise
de
concubinis
retinendis
which
phutatorius
had
published
about
twenty
years
ago
and
was
that
identical
week
going
to
give
the
world
a
second
edition
of
it
is
not
my
business
to
dip
my
pen
in
this
controversy
much
undoubtedly
may
be
wrote
on
both
sides
of
the
question
all
that
concerns
me
as
an
historian
is
to
represent
the
matter
of
fact
and
render
it
credible
to
the
reader
that
the
hiatus
in
breeches
was
sufficiently
wide
to
receive
the
chesnut
and
that
the
chesnut
somehow
or
other
did
fall
perpendicularly
and
piping
hot
into
it
without
phutatorius
perceiving
it
or
any
one
else
at
that
time
the
genial
warmth
which
the
chesnut
imparted
was
not
undelectable
for
the
first
twenty
or
seconds
and
did
no
more
than
gently
solicit
phutatorius
attention
towards
the
part
but
the
heat
gradually
increasing
and
in
a
few
seconds
more
getting
beyond
the
point
of
all
sober
pleasure
and
then
advancing
with
all
speed
into
the
regions
of
pain
the
soul
of
phutatorius
together
with
all
his
ideas
his
thoughts
his
attention
his
imagination
judgment
resolution
deliberation
ratiocination
memory
fancy
with
ten
battalions
of
animal
spirits
all
tumultuously
crowded
down
through
different
defiles
and
circuits
to
the
place
of
danger
leaving
all
his
upper
regions
as
you
may
imagine
as
empty
as
my
purse
with
the
best
intelligence
which
all
these
messengers
could
bring
him
back
phutatorius
was
not
able
to
dive
into
the
secret
of
what
was
going
forwards
below
nor
could
he
make
any
kind
of
conjecture
what
the
devil
was
the
matter
with
it
however
as
he
knew
not
what
the
true
cause
might
turn
out
he
deemed
it
most
prudent
in
the
situation
he
was
in
at
present
to
bear
it
if
possible
like
a
stoick
which
with
the
help
of
some
wry
faces
and
compursions
of
the
mouth
he
had
certainly
accomplished
had
his
imagination
continued
neuter
but
the
sallies
of
the
imagination
are
ungovernable
in
things
of
this
kind
a
thought
instantly
darted
into
his
mind
that
tho
the
anguish
had
the
sensation
of
glowing
heat
it
might
notwithstanding
that
be
a
bite
as
well
as
a
burn
and
if
so
that
possibly
a
newt
or
an
asker
or
some
such
detested
reptile
had
crept
up
and
was
fastening
his
teeth
the
horrid
idea
of
which
with
a
fresh
glow
of
pain
arising
that
instant
from
the
chesnut
seized
phutatorius
with
a
sudden
panick
and
in
the
first
terrifying
disorder
of
the
passion
it
threw
him
as
it
has
done
the
best
generals
upon
earth
quite
off
his
guard
the
effect
of
which
was
this
that
he
leapt
incontinently
up
uttering
as
he
rose
that
interjection
of
surprise
so
much
descanted
upon
with
the
aposiopestic
break
after
it
marked
thus
z
ds
which
though
not
strictly
canonical
was
still
as
little
as
any
man
could
have
said
upon
the
occasion
and
which
whether
canonical
or
not
phutatorius
could
no
more
help
than
he
could
the
cause
of
it
though
this
has
taken
up
some
time
in
the
narrative
it
took
up
little
more
time
in
the
transaction
than
just
to
allow
time
for
phutatorius
to
draw
forth
the
chesnut
and
throw
it
down
with
violence
upon
the
floor
and
for
yorick
to
rise
from
his
chair
and
pick
the
chesnut
up
it
is
curious
to
observe
the
triumph
of
slight
incidents
over
the
mind
what
incredible
weight
they
have
in
forming
and
governing
our
opinions
both
of
men
and
things
that
trifles
light
as
air
shall
waft
a
belief
into
the
soul
and
plant
it
so
immoveably
within
it
that
euclid
demonstrations
could
they
be
brought
to
batter
it
in
breach
should
not
all
have
power
to
overthrow
it
yorick
i
said
picked
up
the
chesnut
which
phutatorius
wrath
had
flung
down
the
action
was
trifling
i
am
ashamed
to
account
for
it
he
did
it
for
no
reason
but
that
he
thought
the
chesnut
not
a
jot
worse
for
the
adventure
and
that
he
held
a
good
chesnut
worth
stooping
but
this
incident
trifling
as
it
was
wrought
differently
in
phutatorius
head
he
considered
this
act
of
yorick
in
getting
off
his
chair
and
picking
up
the
chesnut
as
a
plain
acknowledgment
in
him
that
the
chesnut
was
originally
his
and
in
course
that
it
must
have
been
the
owner
of
the
chesnut
and
no
one
else
who
could
have
played
him
such
a
prank
with
it
what
greatly
confirmed
him
in
this
opinion
was
this
that
the
table
being
parallelogramical
and
very
narrow
it
afforded
a
fair
opportunity
for
yorick
who
sat
directly
over
against
phutatorius
of
slipping
the
chesnut
in
and
consequently
that
he
did
it
the
look
of
something
more
than
suspicion
which
phutatorius
cast
full
upon
yorick
as
these
thoughts
arose
too
evidently
spoke
his
opinion
and
as
phutatorius
was
naturally
supposed
to
know
more
of
the
matter
than
any
person
besides
his
opinion
at
once
became
the
general
one
and
for
a
reason
very
different
from
any
which
have
been
yet
given
in
a
little
time
it
was
put
out
of
all
manner
of
dispute
when
great
or
unexpected
events
fall
out
upon
the
stage
of
this
sublunary
world
the
mind
of
man
which
is
an
inquisitive
kind
of
a
substance
naturally
takes
a
flight
behind
the
scenes
to
see
what
is
the
cause
and
first
spring
of
the
search
was
not
long
in
this
instance
it
was
well
known
that
yorick
had
never
a
good
opinion
of
the
treatise
which
phutatorius
had
wrote
de
concubinis
retinendis
as
a
thing
which
he
feared
had
done
hurt
in
the
world
and
was
easily
found
out
that
there
was
a
mystical
meaning
in
yorick
prank
and
that
his
chucking
the
chesnut
hot
into
phutatorius
was
a
sarcastical
fling
at
his
book
the
doctrines
of
which
they
said
had
enflamed
many
an
honest
man
in
the
same
place
this
conceit
awaken
somnolentus
made
agelastes
smile
and
if
you
can
recollect
the
precise
look
and
air
of
a
man
face
intent
in
finding
out
a
riddle
it
threw
gastripheres
into
that
form
and
in
short
was
thought
by
many
to
be
a
of
this
as
the
reader
has
seen
from
one
end
to
the
other
was
as
groundless
as
the
dreams
of
philosophy
yorick
no
doubt
as
shakespeare
said
of
his
ancestor
a
man
of
jest
but
it
was
temper
with
something
which
withheld
him
from
that
and
many
other
ungracious
pranks
of
which
he
as
undeservedly
bore
the
blame
but
it
was
his
misfortune
all
his
life
long
to
bear
the
imputation
of
saying
and
doing
a
thousand
things
of
which
unless
my
esteem
blinds
me
his
nature
was
incapable
all
i
blame
him
for
or
rather
all
i
blame
and
alternately
like
him
for
was
that
singularity
of
his
temper
which
would
never
suffer
him
to
take
pains
to
set
a
story
right
with
the
world
however
in
his
power
in
every
ill
usage
of
that
sort
he
acted
precisely
as
in
the
affair
of
his
lean
horse
he
could
have
explained
it
to
his
honour
but
his
spirit
was
above
it
and
besides
he
ever
looked
upon
the
inventor
the
propagator
and
believer
of
an
illiberal
report
alike
so
injurious
to
him
he
could
not
stoop
to
tell
his
story
to
them
and
so
trusted
to
time
and
truth
to
do
it
for
him
this
heroic
cast
produced
him
inconveniences
in
many
respects
in
the
present
it
was
followed
by
the
fixed
resentment
of
phutatorius
who
as
yorick
had
just
made
an
end
of
his
chesnut
rose
up
from
his
chair
a
second
time
to
let
him
know
it
which
indeed
he
did
with
a
smile
saying
only
that
he
would
endeavour
not
to
forget
the
obligation
but
you
must
mark
and
carefully
separate
and
distinguish
these
two
things
in
your
mind
the
smile
was
for
the
company
the
threat
was
for
yorick
chapter
can
you
tell
me
quoth
phutatorius
speaking
to
gastripheres
who
sat
next
to
him
for
one
would
not
apply
to
a
surgeon
in
so
foolish
an
affair
can
you
tell
me
gastripheres
what
is
best
to
take
out
the
fire
ask
eugenius
said
that
greatly
depends
said
eugenius
pretending
ignorance
of
the
adventure
upon
the
nature
of
the
part
if
it
is
a
tender
part
and
a
part
which
can
conveniently
be
wrapt
up
it
is
both
the
one
and
the
other
replied
phutatorius
laying
his
hand
as
he
spoke
with
an
emphatical
nod
of
his
head
upon
the
part
in
question
and
lifting
up
his
right
leg
at
the
same
time
to
ease
and
ventilate
if
that
is
the
case
said
eugenius
i
would
advise
you
phutatorius
not
to
tamper
with
it
by
any
means
but
if
you
will
send
to
the
next
printer
and
trust
your
cure
to
such
a
simple
thing
as
a
soft
sheet
of
paper
just
come
off
the
press
you
need
do
nothing
more
than
twist
it
the
damp
paper
quoth
yorick
who
sat
next
to
his
friend
eugenius
though
i
know
it
has
a
refreshing
coolness
in
it
yet
i
presume
is
no
more
than
the
vehicle
and
that
the
oil
and
with
which
the
paper
is
so
strongly
impregnated
does
the
right
said
eugenius
and
is
of
any
outward
application
i
would
venture
to
recommend
the
most
anodyne
and
safe
was
it
my
case
said
gastripheres
as
the
main
thing
is
the
oil
and
i
should
spread
them
thick
upon
a
rag
and
clap
it
on
that
would
make
a
very
devil
of
it
replied
and
besides
added
eugenius
it
would
not
answer
the
intention
which
is
the
extreme
neatness
and
elegance
of
the
prescription
which
the
faculty
hold
to
be
half
in
half
for
consider
if
the
type
is
a
very
small
one
which
it
should
be
the
sanative
particles
which
come
into
contact
in
this
form
have
the
advantage
of
being
spread
so
infinitely
thin
and
with
such
a
mathematical
equality
fresh
paragraphs
and
large
capitals
excepted
as
no
art
or
management
of
the
spatula
can
come
up
it
falls
out
very
luckily
replied
phutatorius
that
the
second
edition
of
my
treatise
de
concubinis
retinendis
is
at
this
instant
in
the
you
may
take
any
leaf
of
it
said
eugenius
no
matter
provided
quoth
yorick
there
is
no
bawdry
in
they
are
just
now
replied
phutatorius
printing
off
the
ninth
chapter
which
is
the
last
chapter
but
one
in
the
pray
what
is
the
title
of
that
chapter
said
yorick
making
a
respectful
bow
to
phutatorius
as
he
i
think
answered
phutatorius
is
that
de
re
concubinaria
for
heaven
sake
keep
out
of
that
chapter
quoth
yorick
by
all
means
added
eugenius
chapter
now
quoth
didius
rising
up
and
laying
his
right
hand
with
his
fingers
spread
upon
his
breast
had
such
a
blunder
about
a
happened
before
the
reformation
it
happened
the
day
before
yesterday
quoth
my
uncle
toby
to
himself
and
when
baptism
was
administer
in
latin
was
all
in
english
said
my
uncle
many
things
might
have
coincided
with
it
and
upon
the
authority
of
sundry
decreed
cases
to
have
pronounced
the
baptism
null
with
a
power
of
giving
the
child
a
new
name
had
a
priest
for
instance
which
was
no
uncommon
thing
through
ignorance
of
the
latin
tongue
baptized
a
child
of
in
nomine
patriae
filia
spiritum
sanctos
the
baptism
was
held
i
beg
your
pardon
replied
kysarcius
in
that
case
as
the
mistake
was
only
the
terminations
the
baptism
was
valid
and
to
have
rendered
it
null
the
blunder
of
the
priest
should
have
fallen
upon
the
first
syllable
of
each
noun
and
not
as
in
your
case
upon
the
last
my
father
delighted
in
subtleties
of
this
kind
and
listen
with
infinite
attention
gastripheres
for
example
continued
kysarcius
baptizes
a
child
of
john
stradling
in
gomine
gatris
instead
of
in
nomine

is
this
a
baptism
no
say
the
ablest
canonists
in
as
much
as
the
radix
of
each
word
is
hereby
torn
up
and
the
sense
and
meaning
of
them
removed
and
changed
quite
to
another
object
for
gomine
does
not
signify
a
name
nor
gatris
a
what
do
they
signify
said
my
uncle
nothing
at
all
quoth
ergo
such
a
baptism
is
null
said
in
course
answered
yorick
in
a
tone
two
parts
jest
and
one
part
but
in
the
case
cited
continued
kysarcius
where
patriae
is
put
for
patris
filia
for
filii
and
so
on
as
it
is
a
fault
only
in
the
declension
and
the
roots
of
the
words
continue
untouch
the
inflections
of
their
branches
either
this
way
or
that
does
not
in
any
sort
hinder
the
baptism
inasmuch
as
the
same
sense
continues
in
the
words
as
but
then
said
didius
the
intention
of
the
pronouncing
them
grammatically
must
have
been
proved
to
have
gone
along
with
right
answered
kysarcius
and
of
this
brother
didius
we
have
an
instance
in
a
decree
of
the
decretals
of

leo
the
but
my

said
kysarcius
interrupting
my

toby
of
those
only
who
stand
related
to

to
have

this
matter

in
my
uncle

lay
down
his

and
my
father
drew
his
chair
still
closer
to
the
table
to
hear
the
conclusion
of

after
much
dispassionate
enquiry
and
jactitation
of
the
arguments
on

instantly
clapp
his

upon
my

mouth
under
colour
of
whispering
in
his
ear
the
truth
was
he
was
alarmed
for

having
a
great
desire
to
hear
more
of
so
curious
an
argument

my

gave
a

resumed
his

and
contenting
himself
with
whistling
lillabullero
inwardly
kysarcius
didius
and
triptolemus
went
on
with
the
discourse
as
follows
this
determination
continued
kysarcius
how
contrary
soever
it
may
seem
to
run
to
the
stream
of
vulgar
ideas
yet
had
reason
strongly
on
its
side
and
has
been
put
out
of
all
manner
of
dispute
from
the
famous
case
known
commonly
by

said
kysarcius
the
case
shandy
was
this
in
the
reign
of
edward
the
sixth
charles
duke
of
suffolk
having
issue
a
son
by
one
venter
and
a
daughter
by
another
venter
made
his
last
will
wherein
he
devised
goods
to
his
son
and
died
after
whose
death
the
son
died
also
but
without
will
without
wife
and
without
child
his
mother
and
his
sister
by
the
father
side
for
she
was
born
of
the
former
venter
then
living
the
mother
took
the
administration
of
her
goods
according
to
the
statute
of
the
of
harry
the
eighth
whereby
it
is
enacted
that
in
case
any
person
die
intestate
the
administration
of
his
goods
shall
be
committed
to
the
next
of
kin
the
administration
being
thus
surreptitiously
granted
to
the
mother
the
sister
by
the
father
side
commenced
a
suit
before
the
ecclesiastical
judge
alledging
that
she
herself
was
next
of
kin
and
that
the
mother
was
not
of
kin
at
all
to
the
party
deceased
and
therefore
prayed
the
court
that
the
administration
granted
to
the
mother
might
be
revoked
and
be
committed
unto
her
as
next
of
kin
to
the
deceased
by
force
of
the
said
statute
hereupon
as
it
was
a
great
cause

much
depending
upon

issue

many
causes

property

most

in

principle
in
the
law
said
triptolemus
that
things
do
not
ascend
but
descend
in
it
and
i
make
no
doubt
is
for
this
cause
that
however
true
it
is
that
the
child
may
be
of
the
blood
and
seed
of
its
parents
that
the
parents
nevertheless
are
not
of
the
blood
and
seed
of
it
inasmuch
as
the
parents
are
not
begot
by
the
child
but
the
child
by
the
parents
for
so
they
write
liberi
sunt
de
sanguine
patris
matris
sed
pater
mater
non
sunt
de
sanguine
liberorum
but
this
triptolemus
cried
didius
proves
too
much
for
from
this
authority
cited
it
would
follow
not
only
what
indeed
is
granted
on
all
sides
that
the
mother
is
not
of
kin
to
her
child
but
the
father
it
is
held
said
triptolemus
the
better
opinion
because
the
father
the
mother
and
the
child
though
they
be
three
persons
yet
are
they
but
una
caro
vide
brook
abridg
tit
administr
one
flesh
and
consequently
no
degree
of
kindred
or
any
method
of
acquiring
one
in
there
you
push
the
argument
again
too
far
cried
didius
for
there
is
no
prohibition
in
nature
though
there
is
in
the
levitical
law
but
that
a
man
may
beget
a
child
upon
his
grandmother
in
which
case
supposing
the
issue
a
daughter
she
would
stand
in
relation
both
of
but
who
ever
thought
cried
kysarcius
of
laying
with
his
grandmother
the
young
gentleman
replied
yorick
whom
selden
speaks
of
who
not
only
thought
of
it
but
justified
his
intention
to
his
father
by
the
argument
drawn
from
the
law
of
laid
sir
with
my
mother
said
the
lad
may
not
i
lay
with
yours
is
the
argumentum
commune
added
is
as
good
replied
eugenius
taking
down
his
hat
as
they
deserve
the
company
broke
up
chapter
and
pray
said
my
uncle
toby
leaning
upon
yorick
as
he
and
my
father
were
helping
him
leisurely
down
the
stairs
do
be
terrified
madam
this
conversation
is
not
so
long
as
the
last
and
pray
yorick
said
my
uncle
toby
which
way
is
this
said
affair
of
tristram
at
length
settled
by
these
learned
men
very
satisfactorily
replied
yorick
no
mortal
sir
has
any
concern
with
it
for
shandy
the
mother
is
nothing
at
all
to
him
and
as
the
mother
is
the
surest
side
shandy
in
course
is
still
less
than
nothing
in
short
he
is
not
as
much
to
him
sir
as
i
that
may
well
be
said
my
father
shaking
his
head
let
the
learned
say
what
they
will
there
must
certainly
quoth
my
uncle
toby
have
been
some
sort
of
consanguinity
betwixt
the
duchess
of
suffolk
and
her
son
the
vulgar
are
of
the
same
opinion
quoth
yorick
to
this
hour
chapter
though
my
father
was
hugely
tickled
with
the
subtleties
of
these
learned
discourses
was
still
but
like
the
anointing
of
a
broken
bone
the
moment
he
got
home
the
weight
of
his
afflictions
returned
upon
him
but
so
much
the
heavier
as
is
ever
the
case
when
the
staff
we
lean
on
slips
from
under
he
became
pensive
walked
frequently
forth
to
the
let
down
one
loop
of
his
hat
sigh
often
forbore
to
snap
and
as
the
hasty
sparks
of
temper
which
occasion
snapping
so
much
assist
perspiration
and
digestion
as
hippocrates
tells
us
he
had
certainly
fallen
ill
with
the
extinction
of
them
had
not
his
thoughts
been
critically
drawn
off
and
his
health
rescued
by
a
fresh
train
of
disquietudes
left
him
with
a
legacy
of
a
thousand
pounds
by
my
aunt
dinah
my
father
had
scarce
read
the
letter
when
taking
the
thing
by
the
right
end
he
instantly
began
to
plague
and
puzzle
his
head
how
to
lay
it
out
mostly
to
the
honour
of
his
a
odd
projects
took
possession
of
his
brains
by
turns
he
would
do
this
and
that
and
he
would
go
to
rome
he
would
go
to
law
he
would
buy
stock
he
would
buy
john
hobson
farm
he
would
new
fore
front
his
house
and
add
a
new
wing
to
make
it
even
there
was
a
fine
on
this
side
and
he
would
build
a
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
in
full
view
to
answer
it
but
above
all
things
in
the
world
he
would
inclose
the
great
and
send
out
my
brother
bobby
immediately
upon
his
travels
but
as
the
sum
was
finite
and
consequently
could
not
do
every
thing
and
in
truth
very
few
of
these
to
any
purpose
of
all
the
projects
which
offered
themselves
upon
this
occasion
the
two
last
seemed
to
make
the
deepest
impression
and
he
would
infallibly
have
determined
upon
both
at
once
but
for
the
small
inconvenience
hinted
at
above
which
absolutely
put
him
under
a
necessity
of
deciding
in
favour
either
of
the
one
or
the
other
this
was
not
altogether
so
easy
to
be
done
for
though
is
certain
my
father
had
long
before
set
his
heart
upon
this
necessary
part
of
my
brother
education
and
like
a
prudent
man
had
actually
determined
to
carry
it
into
execution
with
the
first
money
that
returned
from
the
second
creation
of
actions
in
the
in
which
he
was
an
adventurer
yet
the
which
was
a
fine
large
whinny
undrained
unimproved
common
belonging
to
the
had
almost
as
old
a
claim
upon
him
he
had
long
and
affectionately
set
his
heart
upon
turning
it
likewise
to
some
account
but
having
never
hitherto
been
pressed
with
such
a
conjuncture
of
things
as
made
it
necessary
to
settle
either
the
priority
or
justice
of
their
claims
like
a
wise
man
he
had
refrained
entering
into
any
nice
or
critical
examination
about
them
so
that
upon
the
dismission
of
every
other
project
at
this
crisis
the
two
old
projects
the
and
my
brother
divided
him
again
and
so
equal
a
match
were
they
for
each
other
as
to
become
the
occasion
of
no
small
contest
in
the
old
gentleman
mind
which
of
the
two
should
be
set
first
people
may
laugh
as
they
will
but
the
case
was
this
it
had
ever
been
the
custom
of
the
family
and
by
length
of
time
was
almost
become
a
matter
of
common
right
that
the
eldest
son
of
it
should
have
free
ingress
egress
and
regress
into
foreign
parts
before
marriage
not
only
for
the
sake
of
bettering
his
own
private
parts
by
the
benefit
of
exercise
and
change
of
so
much
air
but
simply
for
the
mere
delectation
of
his
fancy
by
the
feather
put
into
his
cap
of
having
been
abroad
tantum
valet
my
father
would
say
quantum
sonat
now
as
this
was
a
reasonable
and
in
course
a
most
christian
indulgence
to
deprive
him
of
it
without
why
or
wherefore
and
thereby
make
an
example
of
him
as
the
first
shandy
unwhirl
about
europe
in
a
and
only
because
he
was
a
heavy
lad
would
be
using
him
ten
times
worse
than
a
turk
on
the
other
hand
the
case
of
the
was
full
as
hard
exclusive
of
the
original
which
was
eight
hundred
pounds
it
had
cost
the
family
eight
hundred
pounds
more
in
a
about
fifteen
years
before
besides
the
lord
knows
what
trouble
and
vexation
it
had
been
moreover
in
possession
of
the
ever
since
the
middle
of
the
last
century
and
though
it
lay
full
in
view
before
the
house
bounded
on
one
extremity
by
the
and
on
the
other
by
the
projected
spoken
of
above
and
for
all
these
reasons
seemed
to
have
the
fairest
title
of
any
part
of
the
estate
to
the
care
and
protection
of
the
family
yet
by
an
unaccountable
fatality
common
to
men
as
well
as
the
ground
they
tread
on
it
had
all
along
most
shamefully
been
overlook
and
to
speak
the
truth
of
it
had
suffered
so
much
by
it
that
it
would
have
made
any
man
heart
have
bled
obadiah
said
who
understood
the
value
of
the
land
to
have
rode
over
it
and
only
seen
the
condition
it
was
in
however
as
neither
the
purchasing
this
tract
of
ground
nor
indeed
the
placing
of
it
where
it
lay
were
either
of
them
properly
speaking
of
my
father
doing
he
had
never
thought
himself
any
way
concerned
in
the
affair
till
the
fifteen
years
before
when
the
breaking
out
of
that
cursed
mentioned
above
and
which
had
arose
about
its
boundaries
which
being
altogether
my
father
own
act
and
deed
it
naturally
awakened
every
other
argument
in
its
favour
and
upon
summing
them
all
up
together
he
saw
not
merely
in
interest
but
in
honour
he
was
bound
to
do
something
for
it
and
that
now
or
never
was
the
time
i
think
there
must
certainly
have
been
a
mixture
of
in
it
that
the
reasons
on
both
sides
should
happen
to
be
so
equally
balanced
by
each
other
for
though
my
father
weigh
them
in
all
humours
and
conditions
spent
many
an
anxious
hour
in
the
most
profound
and
abstracted
meditation
upon
what
was
best
to
be
done
reading
books
of
farming
one
day
books
of
travels
another
laying
aside
all
passion
whatever
viewing
the
arguments
on
both
sides
in
all
their
lights
and
circumstances
communing
every
day
with
my
uncle
toby
arguing
with
yorick
and
talking
over
the
whole
affair
of
the
with
obadiah
yet
nothing
in
all
that
time
appeared
so
strongly
in
behalf
of
the
one
which
was
not
either
strictly
applicable
to
the
other
or
at
least
so
far
counterbalanced
by
some
consideration
of
equal
weight
as
to
keep
the
scales
even
for
to
be
sure
with
proper
helps
in
the
hands
of
some
people
tho
the
would
undoubtedly
have
made
a
different
appearance
in
the
world
from
what
it
did
or
ever
could
do
in
the
condition
it
lay
yet
every
tittle
of
this
was
true
with
regard
to
my
brother
bobby
let
obadiah
say
what
he
in
point
of
interest
the
contest
i
own
at
first
sight
did
not
appear
so
undecisive
betwixt
them
for
whenever
my
father
took
pen
and
ink
in
hand
and
set
about
calculating
the
simple
expence
of
paring
and
burning
and
fencing
in
the
with
the
certain
profit
it
would
bring
him
in
return
the
latter
turned
out
so
prodigiously
in
his
way
of
working
the
account
that
you
would
have
sworn
the
would
have
carried
all
before
it
for
it
was
plain
he
should
reap
a
hundred
lasts
of
rape
at
twenty
pounds
a
last
the
very
first
year
besides
an
excellent
crop
of
wheat
the
year
following
and
the
year
after
that
to
speak
within
bounds
a
hundred
but
in
all
likelihood
a
hundred
and
fifty
if
not
two
hundred
quarters
of
pease
and
beans
besides
potatoes
without
but
then
to
think
he
was
all
this
while
breeding
up
my
brother
like
a
hog
to
eat
them
knocked
all
on
the
head
again
and
generally
left
the
old
gentleman
in
such
a
state
of
suspense
that
as
he
often
declared
to
my
uncle
toby
he
knew
no
more
than
his
heels
what
to
do
no
body
but
he
who
has
felt
it
can
conceive
what
a
plaguing
thing
it
is
to
have
a
man
mind
torn
asunder
by
two
projects
of
equal
strength
both
obstinately
pulling
in
a
contrary
direction
at
the
same
time
for
to
say
nothing
of
the
havock
which
by
a
certain
consequence
is
unavoidably
made
by
it
all
over
the
finer
system
of
the
nerves
which
you
know
convey
the
animal
spirits
and
more
subtle
juices
from
the
heart
to
the
head
and
so
on
it
is
not
to
be
told
in
what
a
degree
such
a
wayward
kind
of
friction
works
upon
the
more
gross
and
solid
parts
wasting
the
fat
and
impairing
the
strength
of
a
man
every
time
as
it
goes
backwards
and
forwards
my
father
had
certainly
sunk
under
this
evil
as
certainly
as
he
had
done
under
that
of
my
christian
name
had
he
not
been
rescued
out
of
it
as
he
was
out
of
that
by
a
fresh
evil
the
misfortune
of
my
brother
bobby
death
what
is
the
life
of
man
is
it
not
to
shift
from
side
to
side
from
sorrow
to
sorrow
to
button
up
one
cause
of
vexation
and
unbutton
another
chapter
from
this
moment
i
am
to
be
considered
as
to
the
shandy
family
and
it
is
from
this
point
properly
that
the
story
of
my
life
and
my
opinions
sets
out
with
all
my
hurry
and
precipitation
i
have
but
been
clearing
the
ground
to
raise
the
building
and
such
a
building
do
i
foresee
it
will
turn
out
as
never
was
planned
and
as
never
was
executed
since
adam
in
less
than
five
minutes
i
shall
have
thrown
my
pen
into
the
fire
and
the
little
drop
of
thick
ink
which
is
left
remaining
at
the
bottom
of
my
after
it
i
have
but
half
a
score
things
to
do
in
the
time
i
have
a
thing
to
name
a
thing
to
lament
a
thing
to
hope
a
thing
to
promise
and
a
thing
to
threaten
i
have
a
thing
to
suppose
a
thing
to
declare
a
thing
to
conceal
a
thing
to
choose
and
a
thing
to
pray
for
this
chapter
therefore
i
name
the
chapter
of
things
and
my
next
chapter
to
it
that
is
the
first
chapter
of
my
next
volume
if
i
live
shall
be
my
chapter
upon
whiskers
in
order
to
keep
up
some
sort
of
connection
in
my
works
the
thing
i
lament
is
that
things
have
crowded
in
so
thick
upon
me
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
get
into
that
part
of
my
work
towards
which
i
have
all
the
way
looked
forwards
with
so
much
earnest
desire
and
that
is
the
campaigns
but
especially
the
amours
of
my
uncle
toby
the
events
of
which
are
of
so
singular
a
nature
and
so
cervantick
a
cast
that
if
i
can
so
manage
it
as
to
convey
but
the
same
impressions
to
every
other
brain
which
the
occurrences
themselves
excite
in
my
own
i
will
answer
for
it
the
book
shall
make
its
way
in
the
world
much
better
than
its
master
has
done
before
oh
tristram
tristram
can
this
but
be
once
brought
about
the
credit
which
will
attend
thee
as
an
author
shall
counterbalance
the
many
evils
will
have
befallen
thee
as
a
man
thou
wilt
feast
upon
the
one
when
thou
hast
lost
all
sense
and
remembrance
of
the
other
no
wonder
i
itch
so
much
as
i
do
to
get
at
these
amours
they
are
the
choicest
morsel
of
my
whole
story
and
when
i
do
get
at
assure
yourselves
good
folks
nor
do
i
value
whose
squeamish
stomach
takes
offence
at
it
i
shall
not
be
at
all
nice
in
the
choice
of
my
words
and
that
the
thing
i
have
to
i
shall
never
get
all
through
in
five
minutes
that
i
fear
and
the
thing
i
hope
is
that
your
worships
and
reverences
are
not
offended
if
you
are
depend
upo
give
you
something
my
good
gentry
next
year
to
be
offended
at
my
dear
jenny
way
but
who
my
jenny
is
and
which
is
the
right
and
which
the
wrong
end
of
a
woman
is
the
thing
to
be
concealed
it
shall
be
told
you
in
the
next
chapter
but
one
to
my
chapter
of
and
not
one
chapter
before
and
now
that
you
have
just
got
to
the
end
of
these
according
to
the
preceding
editions
three
volumes
the
thing
i
have
to
ask
is
how
you
feel
your
heads
my
own
akes
dismally
as
for
your
healths
i
know
they
are
much
true
shandeism
think
what
you
will
against
it
opens
the
heart
and
lungs
and
like
all
those
affections
which
partake
of
its
nature
it
forces
the
blood
and
other
vital
fluids
of
the
body
to
run
freely
through
its
channels
makes
the
wheel
of
life
run
long
and
cheerfully
round
was
i
left
like
sancho
panca
to
choose
my
kingdom
it
should
not
be
maritime

of
no
it
should
be
a

of
hearty
laughing
subjects
and
as
the
bilious
and
more
saturnine
passions
by
creating
disorders
in
the
blood
and
humours
have
as
bad
an
influence
i
see
upon
the
body
politick
as
body
natural
and
as
nothing
but
a
habit
of
virtue
can
fully
govern
those
passions
and
subject
them
to
reason
i
should
add
to
my
prayer
that
god
would
give
my
subjects
grace
to
be
as
wise
as
they
were
merry
and
then
should
i
be

happiest
monarch

they
are

in

called
him

shekinah
of
the
divine
presence
as
chrysostom
the
image
of

as
moses
the
ray
of
divinity
as
plato
the
marvel
of
marvels
as
aristotle
to
go
sneaking
on
at
this
pitiful
pimping
pettifogging
rate
i
scorn
to
be
as
abusive
as
horace
upon
the
occasion
but
if
there
is
no
catachresis
in
the
wish
and
no
sin
in
it
i
wish
from
my
soul
that
every
imitator
in
great
britain
france
and
ireland
had
the
farcy
for
his
pains
and
that
there
was
a
good
farcical
house
large
enough
to
hold
aye
and
sublimate
them
shag
rag
and
male
and
female
all
together
and
this
leads
me
to
the
affair
of
whiskers
but
by
what
chain
of
ideas
i
leave
as
a
legacy
in
to
prudes
and
tartufs
to
enjoy
and
make
the
most
of
upon
whiskers
i
sorry
i
made
it
was
as
inconsiderate
a
promise
as
ever
entered
a
man
head
a
chapter
upon
whiskers
alas
the
world
will
not
bear
it
is
a
delicate
world
but
i
knew
not
of
what
mettle
it
was
made
nor
had
i
ever
seen
the
fragment
otherwise
as
surely
as
noses
are
noses
and
whiskers
are
whiskers
still
let
the
world
say
what
it
will
to
the
contrary
so
surely
would
i
have
steered
clear
of
this
dangerous
chapter
the
fragment
you
are
half
asleep
my
good
lady
said
the
old
gentleman
taking
hold
of
the
old
lady
hand
and
giving
it
a
gentle
squeeze
as
he
pronounced
the
word
whiskers
shall
we
change
the
subject
by
no
means
replied
the
old
lady
i
like
your
account
of
those
matters
so
throwing
a
thin
gauze
handkerchief
over
her
head
and
leaning
it
back
upon
the
chair
with
her
face
turned
towards
him
and
advancing
her
two
feet
as
she
reclined
herself
i
desire
continued
she
you
will
go
on
the
old
gentleman
went
on
as
follows
whiskers
cried
the
queen
of
navarre
dropping
her
knotting
ball
as
la
fosseuse
uttered
the
word
whiskers
madam
said
la
fosseuse
pinning
the
ball
to
the
apron
and
making
a
courtesy
as
she
repeated
it
la
fosseuse
voice
was
naturally
soft
and
low
yet
was
an
articulate
voice
and
every
letter
of
the
word
whiskers
fell
distinctly
upon
the
queen
of
navarre
ear
whiskers
cried
the
queen
laying
a
greater
stress
upon
the
word
and
as
if
she
had
still
distrusted
her
ears
whiskers
replied
la
fosseuse
repeating
the
word
a
third
time
there
is
not
a
cavalier
madam
of
his
age
in
navarre
continued
the
maid
of
honour
pressing
the
page
interest
upon
the
queen
that
has
so
gallant
a
pair
of
what
cried
margaret
smiling
of
whiskers
said
la
fosseuse
with
infinite
modesty
the
word
whiskers
still
stood
its
ground
and
continued
to
be
made
use
of
in
most
of
the
best
companies
throughout
the
little
kingdom
of
navarre
notwithstanding
the
indiscreet
use
which
la
fosseuse
had
made
of
it
the
truth
was
la
fosseuse
had
pronounced
the
word
not
only
before
the
queen
but
upon
sundry
other
occasions
at
court
with
an
accent
which
always
implied
something
of
a
mystery
and
as
the
court
of
margaret
as
all
the
world
knows
was
at
that
time
a
mixture
of
gallantry
and
devotion
and
whiskers
being
as
applicable
to
the
one
as
the
other
the
word
naturally
stood
its
ground
it
gained
full
as
much
as
it
lost
that
is
the
clergy
were
for
it
the
laity
were
against
it
and
for
the
women
they
were
divided
the
excellency
of
the
figure
and
mien
of
the
young
sieur
de
croix
was
at
that
time
beginning
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
maids
of
honour
towards
the
terrace
before
the
palace

where
the

was

the

all

it

not

for

defiles
it
made
a
faint
stand
however
for
a
few
months
by
the
expiration
of
which
the
sieur
de
croix
finding
it
high
time
to
leave
navarre
for
want
of
whiskers
the
word
in
course
became
indecent
and
after
a
few
efforts
absolutely
unfit
for
use
the
best
word
in
the
best
language
of
the
best
world
must
have
suffered
under
such
the
curate
of
wrote
a
book
against
them
setting
forth
the
dangers
of
accessory
ideas
and
warning
the
navarois
against
them
does
not
all
the
world
know
said
the
curate
at
the
conclusion
of
his
work
that
noses
ran
the
same
fate
some
centuries
ago
in
most
parts
of
europe
which
whiskers
have
now
done
in
the
kingdom
of
navarre
the
evil
indeed
spread
no
farther
then
but
have
not
beds
and
bolsters
and
and
stood
upon
the
brink
of
destruction
ever
since
are
not
trouse
and
and
and
spigots
and
faucets
in
danger
still
from
the
same
association
chastity
by
nature
the
gentlest
of
all
affections
give
it
but
its
head
is
like
a
ramping
and
a
roaring
lion
the
drift
of
the
curate
argument
was
not
they
ran
the
scent
the
wrong
the
world
bridled
his
ass
at
the
and
when
the
extremes
of
delicacy
and
the
beginnings
of
concupiscence
hold
their
next
provincial
chapter
together
they
may
decree
that
bawdy
also
chapter
when
my
father
received
the
letter
which
brought
him
the
melancholy
account
of
my
brother
bobby
death
he
was
busy
calculating
the
expence
of
his
riding
post
from
calais
to
paris
and
so
on
to
lyons
was
a
most
inauspicious
journey
my
father
having
had
every
foot
of
it
to
travel
over
again
and
his
calculation
to
begin
afresh
when
he
had
almost
got
to
the
end
of
it
by
obadiah
opening
the
door
to
acquaint
him
the
family
was
out
of
yeast
and
to
ask
whether
he
might
not
take
the
great
early
in
the
morning
and
ride
in
search
of
with
all
my
heart
obadiah
said
my
father
pursuing
his
journey
take
the
and
but
he
wants
a
shoe
poor
creature
said
poor
creature
said
my
uncle
toby
vibrating
the
note
back
again
like
a
string
in
unison
then
ride
the
scotch
horse
quoth
my
father
he
can
not
bear
a
saddle
upon
his
back
quoth
obadiah
for
the
whole
the
devil
in
that
horse
then
take
patriot
cried
my
father
and
shut
the
patriot
is
sold
said
obadiah
here
for
you
cried
my
father
making
a
pause
and
looking
in
my
uncle
toby
face
as
if
the
thing
had
not
been
a
matter
of
your
worship
ordered
me
to
sell
him
last
april
said
then
go
on
foot
for
your
pains
cried
my
father
i
had
much
rather
walk
than
ride
said
obadiah
shutting
the
door
what
plagues
cried
my
father
going
on
with
his
but
the
waters
are
out
said
obadiah
opening
the
door
again
till
that
moment
my
father
who
had
a
map
of
sanson
and
a
book
of
the
before
him
had
kept
his
hand
upon
the
head
of
his
compasses
with
one
foot
of
them
fixed
upon
nevers
the
last
stage
he
had
paid
for
purposing
to
go
on
from
that
point
with
his
journey
and
calculation
as
soon
as
obadiah
quitted
the
room
but
this
second
attack
of
obadiah
in
opening
the
door
and
laying
the
whole
country
under
water
was
too
he
let
go
his
compasses
or
rather
with
a
mixed
motion
between
accident
and
anger
he
threw
them
upon
the
table
and
then
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
to
return
back
to
calais
like
many
others
as
wise
as
he
had
set
out
when
the
letter
was
brought
into
the
parlour
which
contained
the
news
of
my
brother
death
my
father
had
got
forwards
again
upon
his
journey
to
within
a
stride
of
the
compasses
of
the
very
same
stage
of
by
your
leave
mons
sanson
cried
my
father
striking
the
point
of
his
compasses
through
nevers
into
the
table
and
nodding
to
my
uncle
toby
to
see
what
was
in
the
letter
twice
of
one
night
is
too
much
for
an
english
gentleman
and
his
son
mons
sanson
to
be
turned
back
from
so
lousy
a
town
as
nevers
what
thou
toby
added
my
father
in
a
sprightly
unless
it
be
a
garrison
town
said
my
uncle
toby
for
then
i
shall
be
a
fool
said
my
father
smiling
to
himself
as
long
as
i
so
giving
a
second
nod
and
keeping
his
compasses
still
upon
nevers
with
one
hand
and
holding
his
book
of
the
in
the
other
half
calculating
and
half
listening
he
leaned
forwards
upon
the
table
with
both
elbows
as
my
uncle
toby
hummed
over
the
letter
he
gone
said
my
uncle
toby
where
who
cried
my
my
nephew
said
my
uncle
what
without
leave
without
money
without
governor
cried
my
father
in
amazement
no
he
is
dead
my
dear
brother
quoth
my
uncle
without
being
ill
cried
my
father
i
dare
say
not
said
my
uncle
toby
in
a
low
voice
and
fetching
a
deep
sigh
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
has
been
ill
enough
poor
lad
i
answer
for
him
for
he
is
dead
when
agrippina
was
told
of
her
son
death
tacitus
informs
us
that
not
being
able
to
moderate
the
violence
of
her
passions
she
abruptly
broke
off
her
work
my
father
stuck
his
compasses
into
nevers
but
so
much
the
what
contrarieties
his
indeed
was
matter
of
calculation
agrippina
must
have
been
quite
a
different
affair
who
else
could
pretend
to
reason
from
history
how
my
father
went
on
in
my
opinion
deserves
a
chapter
to
chapter
and
a
chapter
it
shall
have
and
a
devil
of
a
one
too
so
look
to
yourselves
is
either
plato
or
plutarch
or
seneca
or
xenophon
or
epictetus
or
theophrastus
or
lucian
or
some
one
perhaps
of
later
date
either
cardan
or
budaeus
or
petrarch
or
stella
or
possibly
it
may
be
some
divine
or
father
of
the
church
austin
or
cyprian
or
barnard
who
affirms
that
it
is
an
irresistible
and
natural
passion
to
weep
for
the
loss
of
our
friends
or
children
and
seneca
i
positive
tells
us
somewhere
that
such
griefs
evacuate
themselves
best
by
that
particular
channel
and
accordingly
we
find
that
david
wept
for
his
son
absalom
adrian
for
his
antinous
niobe
for
her
children
and
that
apollodorus
and
crito
both
shed
tears
for
socrates
before
his
death
my
father
managed
his
affliction
otherwise
and
indeed
differently
from
most
men
either
ancient
or
modern
for
he
neither
wept
it
away
as
the
hebrews
and
the
romans
or
slept
it
off
as
the
laplanders
or
hanged
it
as
the
english
or
drowned
it
as
the
germans
nor
did
he
curse
it
or
damn
it
or
excommunicate
it
or
rhyme
it
or
lillabullero
he
got
rid
of
it
however
will
your
worships
give
me
leave
to
squeeze
in
a
story
between
these
two
pages
when
tully
was
bereft
of
his
dear
daughter
tullia
at
first
he
laid
it
to
his
heart
he
listened
to
the
voice
of
nature
and
modulated
his
own
unto
o
my
tullia
my
daughter
my
child
still
still
still
was
o
my
tullia
my
tullia
methinks
i
see
my
tullia
i
hear
my
tullia
i
talk
with
my
but
as
soon
as
he
began
to
look
into
the
stores
of
philosophy
and
consider
how
many
excellent
things
might
be
said
upon
the
occasion
no
body
upon
earth
can
conceive
says
the
great
orator
how
happy
how
joyful
it
made
me
my
father
was
as
proud
of
his
eloquence
as
marcus
tullius
cicero
could
be
for
his
life
and
for
aught
i
am
convinced
of
to
the
contrary
at
present
with
as
much
reason
it
was
indeed
his
strength
and
his
weakness
his
strength
for
he
was
by
nature
eloquent
and
his
weakness
for
he
was
hourly
a
dupe
to
it
and
provided
an
occasion
in
life
would
but
permit
him
to
shew
his
talents
or
say
either
a
wise
thing
a
witty
or
a
shrewd
one
bating
the
case
of
a
systematic
misfortune
he
had
all
he
a
blessing
which
tied
up
my
tongue
and
a
misfortune
which
let
it
loose
with
a
good
grace
were
pretty
equal
sometimes
indeed
the
misfortune
was
the
better
of
the
two
for
instance
where
the
pleasure
of
the
harangue
was
as
ten
and
the
pain
of
the
misfortune
but
as
five
my
father
gained
half
in
half
and
consequently
was
as
well
again
off
as
if
it
had
never
befallen
him
this
clue
will
unravel
what
otherwise
would
seem
very
inconsistent
in
my
father
domestic
character
and
it
is
this
that
in
the
provocations
arising
from
the
neglects
and
blunders
of
servants
or
other
mishaps
unavoidable
in
a
family
his
anger
or
rather
the
duration
of
it
eternally
ran
counter
to
all
conjecture
my
father
had
a
favourite
little
mare
which
he
had
consigned
over
to
a
most
beautiful
arabian
horse
in
order
to
have
a
pad
out
of
her
for
his
own
riding
he
was
sanguine
in
all
his
projects
so
talked
about
his
pad
every
day
with
as
absolute
a
security
as
if
it
had
been
reared
broke
and
bridled
and
saddled
at
his
door
ready
for
mounting
by
some
neglect
or
other
in
obadiah
it
so
fell
out
that
my
expectations
were
answered
with
nothing
better
than
a
mule
and
as
ugly
a
beast
of
the
kind
as
ever
was
produced
my
mother
and
my
uncle
toby
expected
my
father
would
be
the
death
of
obadiah
and
that
there
never
would
be
an
end
of
the
disaster
see
here
you
rascal
cried
my
father
pointing
to
the
mule
what
you
have
done
it
was
not
me
said
how
do
i
know
that
replied
my
father
triumph
swam
in
my
father
eyes
at
the
repartee
the
attic
salt
brought
water
into
them
and
so
obadiah
heard
no
more
about
it
now
let
us
go
back
to
my
brother
death
philosophy
has
a
fine
saying
for
every
for
death
it
has
an
entire
set
the
misery
was
they
all
at
once
rushed
into
my
head
that
was
difficult
to
string
them
together
so
as
to
make
any
thing
of
a
consistent
show
out
of
he
took
them
as
they
came
an
inevitable
chance
the
first
statute
in
magna
charta
it
is
an
everlasting
act
of
parliament
my
dear
brother
all
must
die
my
son
could
not
have
died
it
had
been
matter
of
wonder
not
that
he
is
dead
and
princes
dance
in
the
same
ring
with
to
die
is
the
great
debt
and
tribute
due
unto
nature
tombs
and
monuments
which
should
perpetuate
our
memories
pay
it
themselves
and
the
proudest
pyramid
of
them
all
which
wealth
and
science
have
erected
has
lost
its
apex
and
stands
obtruncated
in
the
traveller
horizon
my
father
found
he
got
great
ease
and
went
on
and
provinces
and
towns
and
cities
have
they
not
their
periods
and
when
those
principles
and
powers
which
at
first
cemented
and
put
them
together
have
performed
their
several
evolutions
they
fall
back
brother
shandy
said
my
uncle
toby
laying
down
his
pipe
at
the
word
evolutions
revolutions
i
meant
quoth
my
father
by
heaven
i
meant
revolutions
brother
toby
evolutions
is
is
not
nonsense
said
my
uncle
but
is
it
not
nonsense
to
break
the
thread
of
such
a
discourse
upon
such
an
occasion
cried
my
father
do
not
dear
toby
continued
he
taking
him
by
the
hand
do
not
do
not
i
beseech
thee
interrupt
me
at
this
my
uncle
toby
put
his
pipe
into
his
mouth
is
troy
and
mycenae
and
thebes
and
delos
and
persepolis
and
agrigentum
continued
my
father
taking
up
his
book
of
which
he
had
laid
is
become
brother
toby
of
nineveh
and
babylon
of
cizicum
and
mitylenae
the
fairest
towns
that
ever
the
sun
rose
upon
are
now
no
more
the
names
only
are
left
and
those
for
many
of
them
are
wrong
spelt
are
falling
themselves
by
to
decay
and
in
length
of
time
will
be
forgotten
and
involved
with
every
thing
in
a
perpetual
night
the
world
itself
brother
toby
must
must
come
to
an
end
out
of
asia
when
i
sailed
from
aegina
towards
megara
when
can
this
have
been
thought
my
uncle
toby
began
to
view
the
country
round
about
aegina
was
behind
me
megara
was
before
pyraeus
on
the
right
hand
corinth
on
the
what
flourishing
towns
now
prostrate
upon
the
earth
alas
alas
said
i
to
myself
that
man
should
disturb
his
soul
for
the
loss
of
a
child
when
so
much
as
this
lies
awfully
buried
in
his
presence
remember
said
i
to
myself
again
remember
thou
art
a
man
now
my
uncle
toby
knew
not
that
this
last
paragraph
was
an
extract
of
servius
sulpicius
consolatory
letter
to
he
had
as
little
skill
honest
man
in
the
fragments
as
he
had
in
the
whole
pieces
of
and
as
my
father
whilst
he
was
concerned
in
the
turkey
trade
had
been
three
or
four
different
times
in
the
levant
in
one
of
which
he
had
stayed
a
whole
year
and
an
half
at
zant
my
uncle
toby
naturally
concluded
that
in
some
one
of
these
periods
he
had
taken
a
trip
across
the
archipelago
into
asia
and
that
all
this
sailing
affair
with
aegina
behind
and
megara
before
and
pyraeus
on
the
right
hand
was
nothing
more
than
the
true
course
of
my
father
voyage
and
was
certainly
in
his
manner
and
many
an
undertaking
critic
would
have
built
two
stories
higher
upon
worse
and
pray
brother
quoth
my
uncle
toby
laying
the
end
of
his
pipe
upon
my
father
hand
in
a
kindly
way
of
interruption
but
waiting
till
he
finished
the
account
what
year
of
our
lord
was
this
was
no
year
of
our
lord
replied
my
that
impossible
cried
my
uncle
simpleton
said
my
father
was
forty
years
before
christ
was
born
my
uncle
toby
had
but
two
things
for
it
either
to
suppose
his
brother
to
be
the
wandering
jew
or
that
his
misfortunes
had
disordered
his
the
lord
god
of
heaven
and
earth
protect
him
and
restore
him
said
my
uncle
toby
praying
silently
for
my
father
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
my
father
placed
the
tears
to
a
proper
account
and
went
on
with
his
harangue
with
great
spirit
is
not
such
great
odds
brother
toby
betwixt
good
and
evil
as
the
world
imagines
this
way
of
setting
off
by
the
bye
was
not
likely
to
cure
my
uncle
toby
suspicions
sorrow
grief
sickness
want
and
woe
are
the
sauces
of
life
much
good
may
do
them
said
my
uncle
toby
to
son
is
dead
so
much
the
better
is
a
shame
in
such
a
tempest
to
have
but
one
anchor
he
is
gone
for
ever
from
us
be
it
so
he
is
got
from
under
the
hands
of
his
barber
before
he
was
bald
he
is
but
risen
from
a
feast
before
he
was
surfeited
from
a
banquet
before
he
had
got
drunken
thracians
wept
when
a
child
was
born
and
we
were
very
near
it
quoth
my
uncle
toby
feasted
and
made
merry
when
a
man
went
out
of
the
world
and
with
death
opens
the
gate
of
fame
and
shuts
the
gate
of
envy
after
it
it
unlooses
the
chain
of
the
captive
and
puts
the
bondsman
task
into
another
man
hands
me
the
man
who
knows
what
life
is
who
dreads
it
and
i
shew
thee
a
prisoner
who
dreads
his
liberty
is
it
not
better
my
dear
brother
toby
for
mark
our
appetites
are
but
diseases
is
it
not
better
not
to
hunger
at
all
than
to
eat
not
to
thirst
than
to
take
physic
to
cure
it
is
it
not
better
to
be
freed
from
cares
and
agues
from
love
and
melancholy
and
the
other
hot
and
cold
fits
of
life
than
like
a
galled
traveller
who
comes
weary
to
his
inn
to
be
bound
to
begin
his
journey
afresh
there
is
no
terrour
brother
toby
in
its
looks
but
what
it
borrows
from
groans
and
convulsions
and
the
blowing
of
noses
and
the
wiping
away
of
tears
with
the
bottoms
of
curtains
in
a
dying
strip
it
of
these
what
is
it
is
better
in
battle
than
in
bed
said
my
uncle
take
away
its
hearses
its
mutes
and
its
mourning
its
plumes
scutcheons
and
other
mechanic
aids
what
is
it
better
in
battle
continued
my
father
smiling
for
he
had
absolutely
forgot
my
brother
bobby
is
terrible
no
way
for
consider
brother
toby
when
we
are
death
is
not
and
when
death
is
we
are
not
my
uncle
toby
laid
down
his
pipe
to
consider
the
proposition
my
father
eloquence
was
too
rapid
to
stay
for
any
man
away
it
went
and
hurried
my
uncle
toby
ideas
along
with
for
this
reason
continued
my
father
is
worthy
to
recollect
how
little
alteration
in
great
men
the
approaches
of
death
have
vespasian
died
in
a
jest
upon
his
galba
with
a
sentence
septimus
severus
in
a
dispatch
tiberius
in
dissimulation
and
caesar
augustus
in
a
i
hope
was
a
sincere
one
quoth
my
uncle
toby
was
to
his
wife
said
my
father
chapter
and
lastly
for
all
the
choice
anecdotes
which
history
can
produce
of
this
matter
continued
my
father
this
like
the
gilded
dome
which
covers
in
the
fabric
crowns
of
cornelius
gallus
the
praetor
which
i
dare
say
brother
toby
you
have
i
dare
say
i
have
not
replied
my
he
died
said
my
father
as
and
if
it
was
with
his
wife
said
my
uncle
toby
there
could
be
no
hurt
in
that
more
than
i
know
replied
my
father
chapter
my
mother
was
going
very
gingerly
in
the
dark
along
the
passage
which
led
to
the
parlour
as
my
uncle
toby
pronounced
the
word
is
a
shrill
penetrating
sound
of
itself
and
obadiah
had
helped
it
by
leaving
the
door
a
little
so
that
my
mother
heard
enough
of
it
to
imagine
herself
the
subject
of
the
conversation
so
laying
the
edge
of
her
finger
across
her
two
lips
holding
in
her
breath
and
bending
her
head
a
little
downwards
with
a
twist
of
her
neck
not
towards
the
door
but
from
it
by
which
means
her
ear
was
brought
to
the
chink
she
listened
with
all
her
powers
the
listening
slave
with
the
goddess
of
silence
at
his
back
could
not
have
given
a
finer
thought
for
an
intaglio
in
this
attitude
i
am
determined
to
let
her
stand
for
five
minutes
till
i
bring
up
the
affairs
of
the
kitchen
as
rapin
does
those
of
the
church
to
the
same
period
chapter
though
in
one
sense
our
family
was
certainly
a
simple
machine
as
it
consisted
of
a
few
wheels
yet
there
was
thus
much
to
be
said
for
it
that
these
wheels
were
set
in
motion
by
so
many
different
springs
and
acted
one
upon
the
other
from
such
a
variety
of
strange
principles
and
impulses
that
though
it
was
a
simple
machine
it
had
all
the
honour
and
advantages
of
a
complex
one
and
a
number
of
as
odd
movements
within
it
as
ever
were
beheld
in
the
inside
of
a
dutch
amongst
these
there
was
one
i
am
going
to
speak
of
in
which
perhaps
it
was
not
altogether
so
singular
as
in
many
others
and
it
was
this
that
whatever
motion
debate
harangue
dialogue
project
or
dissertation
was
going
forwards
in
the
parlour
there
was
generally
another
at
the
same
time
and
upon
the
same
subject
running
parallel
along
with
it
in
the
kitchen
now
to
bring
this
about
whenever
an
extraordinary
message
or
letter
was
delivered
in
the
parlour
or
a
discourse
suspended
till
a
servant
went
out
or
the
lines
of
discontent
were
observed
to
hang
upon
the
brows
of
my
father
or
mother
or
in
short
when
any
thing
was
supposed
to
be
upon
the
tapis
worth
knowing
or
listening
to
was
the
rule
to
leave
the
door
not
absolutely
shut
but
somewhat
as
it
stands
just
now
which
under
covert
of
the
bad
hinge
and
that
possibly
might
be
one
of
the
many
reasons
why
it
was
never
mended
it
was
not
difficult
to
manage
by
which
means
in
all
these
cases
a
passage
was
generally
left
not
indeed
as
wide
as
the
dardanelles
but
wide
enough
for
all
that
to
carry
on
as
much
of
this
windward
trade
as
was
sufficient
to
save
my
father
the
trouble
of
governing
his
house
my
mother
at
this
moment
stands
profiting
by
obadiah
did
the
same
thing
as
soon
as
he
had
left
the
letter
upon
the
table
which
brought
the
news
of
my
brother
death
so
that
before
my
father
had
well
got
over
his
surprise
and
entered
upon
his
harangue
had
trim
got
upon
his
legs
to
speak
his
sentiments
upon
the
subject
a
curious
observer
of
nature
had
he
been
worth
the
inventory
of
all
job
stock
though
by
the
bye
your
curious
observers
are
seldom
worth
a
groat
would
have
given
the
half
of
it
to
have
heard
corporal
trim
and
my
father
two
orators
so
contrasted
by
nature
and
education
haranguing
over
the
same
bier
my
father
a
man
of
deep
reading
prompt
memory
with
cato
and
seneca
and
epictetus
at
his
fingers
the
corporal
with
nothing
to
remember
of
no
deeper
reading
than
his
or
greater
names
at
his
fingers
end
than
the
contents
of
it
the
one
proceeding
from
period
to
period
by
metaphor
and
allusion
and
striking
the
fancy
as
he
went
along
as
men
of
wit
and
fancy
do
with
the
entertainment
and
pleasantry
of
his
pictures
and
images
the
other
without
wit
or
antithesis
or
point
or
turn
this
way
or
that
but
leaving
the
images
on
one
side
and
the
picture
on
the
other
going
straight
forwards
as
nature
could
lead
him
to
the
heart
o
trim
would
to
heaven

a
better

a

chapter
my
young
master
in
london
is
dead
said
a
green
sattin
of
my
mother
which
had
been
twice
scoured
was
the
first
idea
which
obadiah
exclamation
brought
into
susannah
well
might
locke
write
a
chapter
upon
the
imperfections
of
then
quoth
susannah
we
must
all
go
into
but
note
a
second
time
the
word
mourning
notwithstanding
susannah
made
use
of
it
herself
failed
also
of
doing
its
office
it
excited
not
one
single
idea
tinged
either
with
grey
or
black
all
was
the
green
sattin
hung
there
still
o
be
the
death
of
my
poor
mistress
cried
my
mother
whole
wardrobe
what
a
procession
her
red
damask
her
orange
tawney
her
white
and
yellow
lutestrings
her
brown
taffata
her
caps
her
and
comfortable
not
a
rag
was
left
she
will
never
look
up
again
said
susannah
we
had
a
fat
foolish
scullion
my
father
i
think
kept
her
for
her
simplicity
she
had
been
all
autumn
struggling
with
a
he
is
dead
said
obadiah
he
is
certainly
dead
so
am
not
i
said
the
foolish
scullion
here
is
sad
news
trim
cried
susannah
wiping
her
eyes
as
trim
stepp
into
the
kitchen
master
bobby
is
dead
and
buried
the
funeral
was
an
interpolation
of
susannah
we
shall
have
all
to
go
into
mourning
said
susannah
i
hope
not
said
you
hope
not
cried
susannah
the
mourning
ran
not
in
trim
head
whatever
it
did
in
i
hope
said
trim
explaining
himself
i
hope
in
god
the
news
is
not
true
i
heard
the
letter
read
with
my
own
ears
answered
obadiah
and
we
shall
have
a
terrible
piece
of
work
of
it
in
stubbing
the
oh
dead
said
as
sure
said
the
scullion
as
i
alive
i
lament
for
him
from
my
heart
and
my
soul
said
trim
fetching
a
poor
creature
poor
boy
poor
gentleman
he
was
alive
last
whitsontide
said
the
whitsontide
alas
cried
trim
extending
his
right
arm
and
falling
instantly
into
the
same
attitude
in
which
he
read
the
sermon
what
is
whitsontide
jonathan
for
that
was
the
coachman
name
or
shrovetide
or
any
tide
or
time
past
to
this
are
we
not
here
now
continued
the
corporal
striking
the
end
of
his
stick
perpendicularly
upon
the
floor
so
as
to
give
an
idea
of
health
and
stability
and
are
we
not
dropping
his
hat
upon
the
ground
gone
in
a
moment
was
infinitely
striking
susannah
burst
into
a
flood
of
we
are
not
stocks
and
jonathan
obadiah
the
all
the
foolish
fat
scullion
herself
who
was
scouring
a
upon
her
knees
was
rous
with
the
whole
kitchen
crowded
about
the
corporal
now
as
i
perceive
plainly
that
the
preservation
of
our
constitution
in
church
and
state
and
possibly
the
preservation
of
the
whole
world
or
what
is
the
same
thing
the
distribution
and
balance
of
its
property
and
power
may
in
time
to
come
depend
greatly
upon
the
right
understanding
of
this
stroke
of
the
corporal
eloquence
i
do
demand
your
attention
your
worships
and
reverences
for
any
ten
pages
together
take
them
where
you
will
in
any
other
part
of
the
work
shall
sleep
for
it
at
your
ease
i
said
were
not
stocks
and
stones
is
very
well
i
should
have
added
nor
are
we
angels
i
wish
we
were
but
men
clothed
with
bodies
and
governed
by
our
imaginations
and
what
a
junketing
piece
of
work
of
it
there
is
betwixt
these
and
our
seven
senses
especially
some
of
them
for
my
own
part
i
own
it
i
am
ashamed
to
confess
let
it
suffice
to
affirm
that
of
all
the
senses
the
eye
for
i
absolutely
deny
the
touch
though
most
of
your
barbati
i
know
are
for
it
has
the
quickest
commerce
with
the
soul
gives
a
smarter
stroke
and
leaves
something
more
inexpressible
upon
the
fancy
than
words
can
either
convey
or
sometimes
get
rid
of
i
gone
a
little
about
no
matter
is
for
health
let
us
only
carry
it
back
in
our
mind
to
the
mortality
of
trim
hat
we
not
here
now
and
gone
in
a
moment
there
was
nothing
in
the
sentence
was
one
of
your
truths
we
have
the
advantage
of
hearing
every
day
and
if
trim
had
not
trusted
more
to
his
hat
than
his
head
he
made
nothing
at
all
of
it
we
not
here
now
continued
the
corporal
are
we
not
dropping
his
hat
plumb
upon
the
ground
and
pausing
before
he
pronounced
the
word
in
a
moment
the
descent
of
the
hat
was
as
if
a
heavy
lump
of
clay
had
been
kneaded
into
the
crown
of
nothing
could
have
expressed
the
sentiment
of
mortality
of
which
it
was
the
type
and
like
it
his
hand
seemed
to
vanish
from
under
it
it
fell
dead
the
corporal
eye
fixed
upon
it
as
upon
a
corpse
and
susannah
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
now
ten
thousand
and
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand
for
matter
and
motion
are
infinite
are
the
ways
by
which
a
hat
may
be
dropped
upon
the
ground
without
any
had
he
flung
it
or
thrown
it
or
cast
it
or
skimmed
it
or
squirted
it
or
let
it
slip
or
fall
in
any
possible
direction
under
heaven
or
in
the
best
direction
that
could
be
given
to
it
had
he
dropped
it
like
a
goose
like
a
puppy
like
an
ass
or
in
doing
it
or
even
after
he
had
done
had
he
looked
like
a
fool
like
a
ninny
like
a
nincompoop
it
had
fail
and
the
effect
upon
the
heart
had
been
lost
ye
who
govern
this
mighty
world
and
its
mighty
concerns
with
the
engines
of
eloquence
who
heat
it
and
cool
it
and
melt
it
and
mollify
it
and
then
harden
it
again
to
your
purpose
ye
who
wind
and
turn
the
passions
with
this
great
windlass
and
having
done
it
lead
the
owners
of
them
whither
ye
think
meet
ye
lastly
who
drive
and
why
not
ye
also
who
are
driven
like
turkeys
to
market
with
a
stick
and
a
red
clout
meditate
meditate
i
beseech
you
upon
trim
hat
chapter
stay
i
have
a
small
account
to
settle
with
the
reader
before
trim
can
go
on
with
his
it
shall
be
done
in
two
minutes
amongst
many
other
all
of
which
i
shall
discharge
in
due
time
i
own
myself
a
debtor
to
the
world
for
two
items
a
chapter
upon
and
which
in
the
former
part
of
my
work
i
promised
and
fully
intended
to
pay
off
this
year
but
some
of
your
worships
and
reverences
telling
me
that
the
two
subjects
especially
so
connected
together
might
endanger
the
morals
of
the
world
i
pray
the
chapter
upon
and
may
be
forgiven
me
and
that
they
will
accept
of
the
last
chapter
in
lieu
of
it
which
is
nothing
a
please
your
reverences
but
a
chapter
of
green
gowns
and
old
hats
trim
took
his
hat
off
the
ground
put
it
upon
his
head
and
then
went
on
with
his
oration
upon
death
in
manner
and
form
following
chapter
to
us
jonathan
who
know
not
what
want
or
care
is
who
live
here
in
the
service
of
two
of
the
best
of
masters
bating
in
my
own
case
his
majesty
king
william
the
third
whom
i
had
the
honour
to
serve
both
in
ireland
and
flanders
i
own
it
that
from
whitsontide
to
within
three
weeks
of
christmas
is
not
long
is
like
nothing
but
to
those
jonathan
who
know
what
death
is
and
what
havock
and
destruction
he
can
make
before
a
man
can
well
wheel
about
is
like
a
whole
o
jonathan
make
a
man
heart
bleed
to
consider
continued
the
corporal
standing
perpendicularly
how
low
many
a
brave
and
upright
fellow
has
been
laid
since
that
time
and
trust
me
susy
added
the
corporal
turning
to
susannah
whose
eyes
were
swimming
in
water
before
that
time
comes
round
again
many
a
bright
eye
will
be
susannah
placed
it
to
the
right
side
of
the
page
she
wept
but
she
are
we
not
continued
trim
looking
still
at
susannah
are
we
not
like
a
flower
of
the
field
a
tear
of
pride
stole
in
betwixt
every
two
tears
of
humiliation
else
no
tongue
could
have
described
susannah
affliction
is
not
all
flesh
grass
tis
clay
is
they
all
looked
directly
at
the
scullion
the
scullion
had
just
been
scouring
a
it
was
not
what
is
the
finest
face
that
ever
man
looked
at
i
could
hear
trim
talk
so
for
ever
cried
susannah
what
is
it
susannah
laid
her
hand
upon
trim
shoulder
but
corruption
susannah
took
it
off
now
i
love
you
for
this
and
is
this
delicious
mixture
within
you
which
makes
you
dear
creatures
what
you
are
and
he
who
hates
you
for
it
all
i
can
say
of
the
matter
is
that
he
has
either
a
pumpkin
for
his
head
or
a
pippin
for
his
heart
and
whenever
he
is
dissected
be
found
so
chapter
whether
susannah
by
taking
her
hand
too
suddenly
from
off
the
corporal
shoulder
by
the
whisking
about
of
her
passions
broke
a
little
the
chain
of
his
reflexions
or
whether
the
corporal
began
to
be
suspicious
he
had
got
into
the
doctor
quarters
and
was
talking
more
like
the
chaplain
than
himself
or
whether
or
whether
for
in
all
such
cases
a
man
of
invention
and
parts
may
with
pleasure
fill
a
couple
of
pages
with
suppositions
which
of
all
these
was
the
cause
let
the
curious
physiologist
or
the
curious
any
body
determine
is
certain
at
least
the
corporal
went
on
thus
with
his
harangue
for
my
own
part
i
declare
it
that
out
of
doors
i
value
not
death
at
all
not
this
added
the
corporal
snapping
his
fingers
but
with
an
air
which
no
one
but
the
corporal
could
have
given
to
the
in
battle
i
value
death
not
this
and
let
him
not
take
me
cowardly
like
poor
joe
gibbins
in
scouring
his
what
is
he
a
pull
of
a
trigger
a
push
of
a
bayonet
an
inch
this
way
or
that
makes
the
look
along
the
line
to
the
right
see
jack
down
well
is
worth
a
regiment
of
horse
to
no
is
dick
then
jack
no
never
mind
which
we
pass
on
in
hot
pursuit
the
wound
itself
which
brings
him
is
not
felt
the
best
way
is
to
stand
up
to
him
the
man
who
flies
is
in
ten
times
more
danger
than
the
man
who
marches
up
into
his
i
look
him
added
the
corporal
an
hundred
times
in
the
face
and
know
what
he
he
nothing
obadiah
at
all
in
the
but
he
very
frightful
in
a
house
quoth
i
never
mind
it
myself
said
jonathan
upon
a
it
must
in
my
opinion
be
most
natural
in
bed
replied
and
could
i
escape
him
by
creeping
into
the
worst
calf
skin
that
ever
was
made
into
a
knapsack
i
would
do
it
there
said
trim
but
that
is
nature
nature
is
nature
said
and
that
is
the
reason
cried
susannah
i
so
much
pity
my
she
will
never
get
the
better
of
now
i
pity
the
captain
the
most
of
any
one
in
the
family
answered
madam
will
get
ease
of
heart
in
weeping
and
the
squire
in
talking
about
it
but
my
poor
master
will
keep
it
all
in
silence
to
i
shall
hear
him
sigh
in
his
bed
for
a
whole
month
together
as
he
did
for
lieutenant
le
fever
an
please
your
honour
do
not
sigh
so
piteously
i
would
say
to
him
as
i
laid
besides
him
i
can
not
help
it
trim
my
master
would
say
is
so
melancholy
an
accident
i
can
not
get
it
off
my
your
honour
fears
not
death
i
hope
trim
i
fear
nothing
he
would
say
but
the
doing
a
wrong
well
he
would
add
whatever
betides
i
will
take
care
of
le
fever
and
with
that
like
a
quieting
draught
his
honour
would
fall
asleep
i
like
to
hear
trim
stories
about
the
captain
said
he
is
a
gentleman
said
obadiah
as
ever
aye
and
as
brave
a
one
too
said
the
corporal
as
ever
stept
before
a
there
never
was
a
better
officer
in
the
king
army
or
a
better
man
in
god
world
for
he
would
march
up
to
the
mouth
of
a
cannon
though
he
saw
the
lighted
match
at
the
very
and
yet
for
all
that
he
has
a
heart
as
soft
as
a
child
for
other
he
would
not
hurt
a
i
would
sooner
quoth
jonathan
drive
such
a
gentleman
for
seven
pounds
a
year
than
some
for
thank
thee
jonathan
for
thy
twenty
shillings
as
much
jonathan
said
the
corporal
shaking
him
by
the
hand
as
if
thou
hadst
put
the
money
into
my
own
i
would
serve
him
to
the
day
of
my
death
out
of
love
he
is
a
friend
and
a
brother
to
me
and
could
i
be
sure
my
poor
brother
tom
was
dead
continued
the
corporal
taking
out
his
handkerchief
was
i
worth
ten
thousand
pounds
i
would
leave
every
shilling
of
it
to
the
trim
could
not
refrain
from
tears
at
this
testamentary
proof
he
gave
of
his
affection
to
his
the
whole
kitchen
was
do
tell
us
the
story
of
the
poor
lieutenant
said
with
all
my
heart
answered
the
corporal
susannah
the
cook
jonathan
obadiah
and
corporal
trim
formed
a
circle
about
the
fire
and
as
soon
as
the
scullion
had
shut
the
kitchen
door
the
corporal
begun
chapter
i
am
a
turk
if
i
had
not
as
much
forgot
my
mother
as
if
nature
had
plaistered
me
up
and
set
me
down
naked
upon
the
banks
of
the
river
nile
without
your
most
obedient
servant
madam
i
cost
you
a
great
deal
of
trouble
i
wish
it
may
answer
but
you
have
left
a
crack
in
my
back
and
here
a
great
piece
fallen
off
here
before
and
what
must
i
do
with
this
foot
i
shall
never
reach
england
with
it
for
my
own
part
i
never
wonder
at
any
thing
and
so
often
has
my
judgment
deceived
me
in
my
life
that
i
always
suspect
it
right
or
wrong
at
least
i
am
seldom
hot
upon
cold
subjects
for
all
this
i
reverence
truth
as
much
as
any
body
and
when
it
has
slipped
us
if
a
man
will
but
take
me
by
the
hand
and
go
quietly
and
search
for
it
as
for
a
thing
we
have
both
lost
and
can
neither
of
us
do
well
without
i
go
to
the
world
end
with
him
but
i
hate
disputes
and
therefore
bating
religious
points
or
such
as
touch
society
i
would
almost
subscribe
to
any
thing
which
does
not
choak
me
in
the
first
passage
rather
than
be
drawn
into
one
but
i
can
not
bear
suffocation
and
bad
smells
worst
of
for
which
reasons
i
resolved
from
the
beginning
that
if
ever
the
army
of
martyrs
was
to
be
augmented
or
a
new
one
raised
i
would
have
no
hand
in
it
one
way
or
chapter
but
to
return
to
my
mother
my
uncle
toby
opinion
madam
there
could
be
no
harm
in
cornelius
gallus
the
roman
praetor
lying
with
his
wife
or
rather
the
last
word
of
that
opinion
for
it
was
all
my
mother
heard
of
it
caught
hold
of
her
by
the
weak
part
of
the
whole
sex
you
shall
not
mistake
me
i
mean
her
curiosity
she
instantly
concluded
herself
the
subject
of
the
conversation
and
with
that
prepossession
upon
her
fancy
you
will
readily
conceive
every
word
my
father
said
was
accommodated
either
to
herself
or
her
family
concerns
pray
madam
in
what
street
does
the
lady
live
who
would
not
have
done
the
same
from
the
strange
mode
of
cornelius
death
my
father
had
made
a
transition
to
that
of
socrates
and
was
giving
my
uncle
toby
an
abstract
of
his
pleading
before
his
judges
was
irresistible
not
the
oration
of
socrates
but
my
father
temptation
to
he
had
wrote
the
life
of
socrates
this
book
my
father
would
never
consent
to
publish
is
in
manuscript
with
some
other
tracts
of
his
in
the
family
all
or
most
of
which
will
be
printed
in
due
time
himself
the
year
before
he
left
off
trade
which
i
fear
was
the
means
of
hastening
him
out
of
it
so
that
no
one
was
able
to
set
out
with
so
full
a
sail
and
in
so
swelling
a
tide
of
heroic
loftiness
upon
the
occasion
as
my
father
was
not
a
period
in
socrates
oration
which
closed
with
a
shorter
word
than
transmigration
or
annihilation
or
a
worse
thought
in
the
middle
of
it
than
to
be
or
not
to
be
the
entering
upon
a
new
and
untried
state
of
things
or
upon
a
long
a
profound
and
peaceful
sleep
without
dreams
without
disturbance
that
we
and
our
children
were
born
to
die
but
neither
of
us
born
to
be
no
there
i
mistake
that
was
part
of
eleazer
oration
as
recorded
by
josephus
de
bell
judaic
eleazer
owns
he
had
it
from
the
philosophers
of
india
in
all
likelihood
alexander
the
great
in
his
irruption
into
india
after
he
had
persia
amongst
the
many
things
he
stole
stole
that
sentiment
also
by
which
means
it
was
carried
if
not
all
the
way
by
himself
for
we
all
know
he
died
at
babylon
at
least
by
some
of
his
maroders
into
greece
from
greece
it
got
to
rome
from
rome
to
france
and
from
france
to
england
so
things
come
by
land
carriage
i
can
conceive
no
other
by
water
the
sentiment
might
easily
have
come
down
the
ganges
into
the
sinus
gangeticus
or
bay
of
bengal
and
so
into
the
indian
sea
and
following
the
course
of
trade
the
way
from
india
by
the
cape
of
good
hope
being
then
unknown
might
be
carried
with
other
drugs
and
spices
up
the
red
sea
to
joddah
the
port
of
mekka
or
else
to
tor
or
sues
towns
at
the
bottom
of
the
gulf
and
from
thence
by
karrawans
to
coptos
but
three
days
journey
distant
so
down
the
nile
directly
to
alexandria
where
the
sentiment
would
be
landed
at
the
very
foot
of
the
great
of
the
alexandrian
library
and
from
that
it
would
be
bless
me
what
a
trade
was
driven
by
the
learned
in
those
days
chapter
now
my
father
had
a
way
a
little
like
that
of
job
in
case
there
ever
was
such
a
man
if
not
there
an
end
of
the
though
by
the
bye
because
your
learned
men
find
some
difficulty
in
fixing
the
precise
aera
in
which
so
great
a
man
lived
whether
for
instance
before
or
after
the
patriarchs
to
vote
therefore
that
he
never
lived
at
all
is
a
little
cruel
is
not
doing
as
they
would
be
done
by
happen
that
as
it
may
my
father
i
say
had
a
way
when
things
went
extremely
wrong
with
him
especially
upon
the
first
sally
of
his
impatience
of
wondering
why
he
was
begot
wishing
himself
dead
sometimes
worse
and
when
the
provocation
ran
high
and
grief
touched
his
lips
with
more
than
ordinary
powers
sir
you
scarce
could
have
distinguished
him
from
socrates
every
word
would
breathe
the
sentiments
of
a
soul
disdaining
life
and
careless
about
all
its
issues
for
which
reason
though
my
mother
was
a
woman
of
no
deep
reading
yet
the
abstract
of
socrates
oration
which
my
father
was
giving
my
uncle
toby
was
not
altogether
new
to
she
listened
to
it
with
composed
intelligence
and
would
have
done
so
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
had
not
my
father
plunged
which
he
had
no
occasion
to
have
done
into
that
part
of
the
pleading
where
the
great
philosopher
reckons
up
his
connections
his
alliances
and
children
but
renounces
a
security
to
be
so
won
by
working
upon
the
passions
of
his
have
friends
i
have
relations
i
have
three
desolate
children
says
then
cried
my
mother
opening
the
door
you
have
one
more
shandy
than
i
know
of
by
heaven
i
have
one
less
said
my
father
getting
up
and
walking
out
of
the
room
chapter
they
are
socrates
children
said
my
uncle
toby
he
has
been
dead
a
hundred
years
ago
replied
my
mother
my
uncle
toby
was
no
chronologer
so
not
caring
to
advance
one
step
but
upon
safe
ground
he
laid
down
his
pipe
deliberately
upon
the
table
and
rising
up
and
taking
my
mother
most
kindly
by
the
hand
without
saying
another
word
either
good
or
bad
to
her
he
led
her
out
after
my
father
that
he
might
finish
the
ecclaircissement
himself
chapter
had
this
volume
been
a
farce
which
unless
every
one
life
and
opinions
are
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
farce
as
well
as
mine
i
see
no
reason
to
suppose
the
last
chapter
sir
had
finished
the
first
act
of
it
and
then
this

chapter
the
first
thing
which
entered
my
father
head
after
affairs
were
a
little
settled
in
the
family
and
susanna
had
got
possession
of
my
mother
green
sattin
was
to
sit
down
coolly
after
the
example
of
xenophon
and
write
a
or
system
of
education
for
me
collecting
first
for
that
purpose
his
own
scattered
thoughts
counsels
and
notions
and
binding
them
together
so
as
to
form
an
institute
for
the
government
of
my
childhood
and
adolescence
i
was
my
father
last
stake
he
had
lost
my
brother
bobby
entirely
he
had
lost
by
his
own
computation
full
of
me
that
is
he
had
been
unfortunate
in
his
three
first
great
casts
for
me
my
geniture
nose
and
name
there
was
but
this
one
left
and
accordingly
my
father
gave
himself
up
to
it
with
as
much
devotion
as
ever
my
uncle
toby
had
done
to
his
doctrine
of
the
difference
between
them
was
that
my
uncle
toby
drew
his
whole
knowledge
of
projectils
from
nicholas
tartaglia
my
father
spun
his
every
thread
of
it
out
of
his
own
brain
or
reeled
and
what
all
other
spinners
and
spinsters
had
spun
before
him
that
was
pretty
near
the
same
torture
to
him
in
about
three
years
or
something
more
my
father
had
got
advanced
almost
into
the
middle
of
his
like
all
other
writers
he
met
with
he
imagined
he
should
be
able
to
bring
whatever
he
had
to
say
into
so
small
a
compass
that
when
it
was
finished
and
bound
it
might
be
rolled
up
in
my
mother
matter
grows
under
our
let
no
man
say
i
write
a
duodecimo
my
father
gave
himself
up
to
it
however
with
the
most
painful
diligence
proceeding
step
by
step
in
every
line
with
the
same
kind
of
caution
and
circumspection
though
i
can
not
say
upon
quite
so
religious
a
principle
as
was
used
by
john
de
la
casse
the
lord
archbishop
of
benevento
in
compassing
his
galatea
in
which
his
grace
of
benevento
spent
near
forty
years
of
his
life
and
when
the
thing
came
out
it
was
not
of
above
half
the
size
or
the
thickness
of
a
rider
how
the
holy
man
managed
the
affair
unless
he
spent
the
greatest
part
of
his
time
in
combing
his
whiskers
or
playing
at
primero
with
his
chaplain
would
pose
any
mortal
not
let
into
the
true
secret
and
therefore
is
worth
explaining
to
the
world
was
it
only
for
the
encouragement
of
those
few
in
it
who
write
not
so
much
to
be
fed
as
to
be
famous
i
own
had
john
de
la
casse
the
archbishop
of
benevento
for
whose
memory
notwithstanding
his
galatea
i
retain
the
highest
veneration
had
he
been
sir
a
slender
clerk
of
dull
wit
slow
parts
costive
head
and
so
forth
he
and
his
galatea
might
have
jogged
on
together
to
the
age
of
methuselah
for
me
the
phaenomenon
had
not
been
worth
a
but
the
reverse
of
this
was
the
truth
john
de
la
casse
was
a
genius
of
fine
parts
and
fertile
fancy
and
yet
with
all
these
great
advantages
of
nature
which
should
have
pricked
him
forwards
with
his
galatea
he
lay
under
an
impuissance
at
the
same
time
of
advancing
above
a
line
and
a
half
in
the
compass
of
a
whole
summer
day
this
disability
in
his
grace
arose
from
an
opinion
he
was
afflicted
with
which
opinion
was
this
viz
that
whenever
a
christian
was
writing
a
book
not
for
his
private
amusement
but
where
his
intent
and
purpose
was
bona
fide
to
print
and
publish
it
to
the
world
his
first
thoughts
were
always
the
temptations
of
the
evil
this
was
the
state
of
ordinary
writers
but
when
a
personage
of
venerable
character
and
high
station
either
in
church
or
state
once
turned
author
he
maintained
that
from
the
very
moment
he
took
pen
in
hand
all
the
devils
in
hell
broke
out
of
their
holes
to
cajole
was
with
them
every
thought
first
and
last
was
captious
how
specious
and
good
soever
was
all
one
in
whatever
form
or
colour
it
presented
itself
to
the
imagination
was
still
a
stroke
of
one
or
other
of
levell
at
him
and
was
to
be
fenced
so
that
the
life
of
a
writer
whatever
he
might
fancy
to
the
contrary
was
not
so
much
a
state
of
composition
as
a
state
of
warfare
and
his
probation
in
it
precisely
that
of
any
other
man
militant
upon
earth
both
depending
alike
not
half
so
much
upon
the
degrees
of
his
wit
as
his
resistance
my
father
was
hugely
pleased
with
this
theory
of
john
de
la
casse
archbishop
of
benevento
and
had
it
not
cramped
him
a
little
in
his
creed
i
believe
would
have
given
ten
of
the
best
acres
in
the
shandy
estate
to
have
been
the
broacher
of
how
far
my
father
actually
believed
in
the
devil
will
be
seen
when
i
come
to
speak
of
my
religious
notions
in
the
progress
of
this
work
is
enough
to
say
here
as
he
could
not
have
the
honour
of
it
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
doctrine
he
took
up
with
the
allegory
of
it
and
would
often
say
especially
when
his
pen
was
a
little
retrograde
there
was
as
much
good
meaning
truth
and
knowledge
couched
under
the
veil
of
john
de
la
casse
parabolical
representation
as
was
to
be
found
in
any
one
poetic
fiction
or
mystic
record
of
prejudice
of
education
he
would
say
is
the
devil
and
the
multitudes
of
them
which
we
suck
in
with
our
mother
milk
are
the
devil
and
we
are
haunted
with
them
brother
toby
in
all
our
lucubrations
and
researches
and
was
a
man
fool
enough
to
submit
tamely
to
what
they
obtruded
upon
him
what
would
his
book
be
nothing
he
would
add
throwing
his
pen
away
with
a
vengeance
nothing
but
a
farrago
of
the
clack
of
nurses
and
of
the
nonsense
of
the
old
women
of
both
sexes
throughout
the
kingdom
this
is
the
best
account
i
am
determined
to
give
of
the
slow
progress
my
father
made
in
his
at
which
as
i
said
he
was
three
years
and
something
more
indefatigably
at
work
and
at
last
had
scarce
completed
by
this
own
reckoning
one
half
of
his
undertaking
the
misfortune
was
that
i
was
all
that
time
totally
neglected
and
abandoned
to
my
mother
and
what
was
almost
as
bad
by
the
very
delay
the
first
part
of
the
work
upon
which
my
father
had
spent
the
most
of
his
pains
was
rendered
entirely
useless
every
day
a
page
or
two
became
of
no
certainly
it
was
ordained
as
a
scourge
upon
the
pride
of
human
wisdom
that
the
wisest
of
us
all
should
thus
outwit
ourselves
and
eternally
forego
our
purposes
in
the
intemperate
act
of
pursuing
them
in
short
my
father
was
so
long
in
all
his
acts
of
resistance
or
in
other
words
he
advanced
so
very
slow
with
his
work
and
i
began
to
live
and
get
forwards
at
such
a
rate
that
if
an
event
had
not
happened
which
when
we
get
to
it
if
it
can
be
told
with
decency
shall
not
be
concealed
a
moment
from
the
reader
i
verily
believe
i
had
put
by
my
father
and
left
him
drawing
a
sundial
for
no
better
purpose
than
to
be
buried
under
ground
chapter
was
nothing
i
did
not
lose
two
drops
of
blood
by
it
was
not
worth
calling
in
a
surgeon
had
he
lived
next
door
to
us
thousands
suffer
by
choice
what
i
did
by
doctor
slop
made
ten
times
more
of
it
than
there
was
occasion
some
men
rise
by
the
art
of
hanging
great
weights
upon
small
wires
and
i
am
this
day
august
the
paying
part
of
the
price
of
this
man
o
provoke
a
stone
to
see
how
things
are
carried
on
in
this
world
the
had
left
no
under
the
bed
can
not
you
contrive
master
quoth
susannah
lifting
up
the
sash
with
one
hand
as
she
spoke
and
helping
me
up
into
the
with
the
other
can
not
you
manage
my
dear
for
a
single
time
to
i
was
five
years
susannah
did
not
consider
that
nothing
was
well
hung
in
our
family
so
slap
came
the
sash
down
like
lightning
upon
us
nothing
is
left
cried
susannah
nothing
is
left
for
me
but
to
run
my
my
uncle
toby
house
was
a
much
kinder
sanctuary
and
so
susannah
fled
to
it
chapter
when
susannah
told
the
corporal
the
misadventure
of
the
sash
with
all
the
circumstances
which
attended
the
murder
of
me
as
she
called
it
the
blood
forsook
his
cheeks
all
accessaries
in
murder
being
principals
trim
conscience
told
him
he
was
as
much
to
blame
as
susannah
and
if
the
doctrine
had
been
true
my
uncle
toby
had
as
much
of
the
bloodshed
to
answer
for
to
heaven
as
either
of
so
that
neither
reason
or
instinct
separate
or
together
could
possibly
have
guided
susannah
steps
to
so
proper
an
asylum
it
is
in
vain
to
leave
this
to
the
reader
imagination
to
form
any
kind
of
hypothesis
that
will
render
these
propositions
feasible
he
must
cudgel
his
brains
sore
and
to
do
it
without
he
must
have
such
brains
as
no
reader
ever
had
before
why
should
i
put
them
either
to
trial
or
to
torture
is
my
own
affair
i
explain
it
myself
chapter
is
a
pity
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
resting
with
his
hand
upon
the
corporal
shoulder
as
they
both
stood
surveying
their
works
that
we
have
not
a
couple
of
to
mount
in
the
gorge
of
that
new
redoubt
secure
the
lines
all
along
there
and
make
the
attack
on
that
side
quite
complete
get
me
a
couple
cast
trim
your
honour
shall
have
them
replied
trim
before
tomorrow
morning
it
was
the
joy
of
trim
heart
nor
was
his
fertile
head
ever
at
a
loss
for
expedients
in
doing
it
to
supply
my
uncle
toby
in
his
campaigns
with
whatever
his
fancy
called
for
had
it
been
his
last
crown
he
would
have
sate
down
and
hammered
it
into
a
paderero
to
have
prevented
a
single
wish
in
his
master
the
corporal
had
already
what
with
cutting
off
the
ends
of
my
uncle
toby
spouts
hacking
and
chiseling
up
the
sides
of
his
leaden
gutters
melting
down
his
pewter
and
going
at
last
like
lewis
the
fourteenth
on
to
the
top
of
the
church
for
spare
ends
he
had
that
very
campaign
brought
no
less
than
eight
new
battering
cannons
besides
three
into
the
field
my
uncle
toby
demand
for
two
more
pieces
for
the
redoubt
had
set
the
corporal
at
work
again
and
no
better
resource
offering
he
had
taken
the
two
leaden
weights
from
the
nursery
window
and
as
the
sash
pullies
when
the
lead
was
gone
were
of
no
kind
of
use
he
had
taken
them
away
also
to
make
a
couple
of
wheels
for
one
of
their
carriages
he
had
dismantled
every
in
my
uncle
toby
house
long
before
in
the
very
same
way
though
not
always
in
the
same
order
for
sometimes
the
pullies
have
been
wanted
and
not
the
lead
so
then
he
began
with
the
pullies
and
the
pullies
being
picked
out
then
the
lead
became
useless
and
so
the
lead
went
to
pot
too
a
great
moral
might
be
picked
handsomely
out
of
this
but
i
have
not
time
is
enough
to
say
wherever
the
demolition
began
was
equally
fatal
to
the
sash
window
chapter
the
corporal
had
not
taken
his
measures
so
badly
in
this
stroke
of
artilleryship
but
that
he
might
have
kept
the
matter
entirely
to
himself
and
left
susannah
to
have
sustained
the
whole
weight
of
the
attack
as
she
could
true
courage
is
not
content
with
coming
off
the
corporal
whether
as
general
or
comptroller
of
the
train
was
no
matter
had
done
that
without
which
as
he
imagined
the
misfortune
could
never
have
happened
at
least
in
hands
how
would
your
honours
have
behaved
he
determined
at
once
not
to
take
shelter
behind
susannah
but
to
give
it
and
with
this
resolution
upon
his
mind
he
marched
upright
into
the
parlour
to
lay
the
whole
manoeuvre
before
my
uncle
toby
my
uncle
toby
had
just
then
been
giving
yorick
an
account
of
the
battle
of
steenkirk
and
of
the
strange
conduct
of
count
solmes
in
ordering
the
foot
to
halt
and
the
horse
to
march
where
it
could
not
act
which
was
directly
contrary
to
the
king
commands
and
proved
the
loss
of
the
day
there
are
incidents
in
some
families
so
pat
to
the
purpose
of
what
is
going
to
follow
they
are
scarce
exceeded
by
the
invention
of
a
dramatic
writer
i
mean
of
ancient
trim
by
the
help
of
his
laid
flat
upon
the
table
and
the
edge
of
his
hand
striking
across
it
at
right
angles
made
a
shift
to
tell
his
story
so
that
priests
and
virgins
might
have
listened
to
it
and
the
story
being
told
the
dialogue
went
on
as
follows
chapter
i
would
be
picquetted
to
death
cried
the
corporal
as
he
concluded
susannah
story
before
i
would
suffer
the
woman
to
come
to
any
harm
was
my
fault
an
please
your
honour
not
her
corporal
trim
replied
my
uncle
toby
putting
on
his
hat
which
lay
upon
the
table
if
any
thing
can
be
said
to
be
a
fault
when
the
service
absolutely
requires
it
should
be
done
is
i
certainly
who
deserve
the
blame
you
obeyed
your
orders
had
count
solmes
trim
done
the
same
at
the
battle
of
steenkirk
said
yorick
drolling
a
little
upon
the
corporal
who
had
been
run
over
by
a
dragoon
in
the
retreat
he
had
saved
thee
saved
cried
trim
interrupting
yorick
and
finishing
the
sentence
for
him
after
his
own
fashion
he
had
saved
five
battalions
an
please
your
reverence
every
soul
of
them
there
was
cutt
continued
the
corporal
clapping
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
upon
the
thumb
of
his
left
and
counting
round
his
hand
there
was
cutt
mackay
angus
graham
and
leven
all
cut
to
pieces
and
so
had
the
english
too
had
it
not
been
for
some
regiments
upon
the
right
who
marched
up
boldly
to
their
relief
and
received
the
enemy
fire
in
their
faces
before
any
one
of
their
own
platoons
discharged
a
musket
they
go
to
heaven
for
it
added
trim
is
right
said
my
uncle
toby
nodding
to
yorick
he
perfectly
right
what
signified
his
marching
the
horse
continued
the
corporal
where
the
ground
was
so
strait
that
the
french
had
such
a
nation
of
hedges
and
copses
and
ditches
and
fell
trees
laid
this
way
and
that
to
cover
them
as
they
always
have
count
solmes
should
have
sent
us
we
would
have
fired
muzzle
to
muzzle
with
them
for
their
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
the
horse
he
had
his
foot
shot
off
however
for
his
pains
continued
the
corporal
the
very
next
campaign
at
poor
trim
got
his
wound
there
quoth
my
uncle
was
owing
an
please
your
honour
entirely
to
count
solmes
had
he
drubbed
them
soundly
at
steenkirk
they
would
not
have
fought
us
at
possibly
not
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
though
if
they
have
the
advantage
of
a
wood
or
you
give
them
a
moment
time
to
intrench
themselves
they
are
a
nation
which
will
pop
and
pop
for
ever
at
there
is
no
way
but
to
march
coolly
up
to
them
receive
their
fire
and
fall
in
upon
them
ding
dong
added
horse
and
foot
said
my
uncle
helter
skelter
said
right
and
left
cried
my
uncle
blood
an
ounds
shouted
the
corporal
the
battle
raged
yorick
drew
his
chair
a
little
to
one
side
for
safety
and
after
a
moment
pause
my
uncle
toby
sinking
his
voice
a
note
resumed
the
discourse
as
follows
chapter
king
william
said
my
uncle
toby
addressing
himself
to
yorick
was
so
terribly
provoked
at
count
solmes
for
disobeying
his
orders
that
he
would
not
suffer
him
to
come
into
his
presence
for
many
months
i
fear
answered
yorick
the
squire
will
be
as
much
provoked
at
the
corporal
as
the
king
at
the
but
be
singularly
hard
in
this
case
continued
be
if
corporal
trim
who
has
behaved
so
diametrically
opposite
to
count
solmes
should
have
the
fate
to
be
rewarded
with
the
same
disgrace
too
oft
in
this
world
do
things
take
that
i
would
spring
a
mine
cried
my
uncle
toby
rising
up
and
blow
up
my
fortifications
and
my
house
with
them
and
we
would
perish
under
their
ruins
ere
i
would
stand
by
and
see
trim
directed
a
slight
but
a
grateful
bow
towards
his
master
and
so
the
chapter
ends
chapter
then
yorick
replied
my
uncle
toby
you
and
i
will
lead
the
way
abreast
and
do
you
corporal
follow
a
few
paces
behind
and
susannah
an
please
your
honour
said
trim
shall
be
put
in
the
was
an
excellent
disposition
and
in
this
order
without
either
drums
beating
or
colours
flying
they
marched
slowly
from
my
uncle
toby
house
to
i
wish
said
trim
as
they
entered
the
door
instead
of
the
sash
weights
i
had
cut
off
the
church
spout
as
i
once
thought
to
have
you
have
cut
off
spouts
enow
replied
yorick
chapter
as
many
pictures
as
have
been
given
of
my
father
how
like
him
soever
in
different
airs
and
attitudes
not
one
or
all
of
them
can
ever
help
the
reader
to
any
kind
of
preconception
of
how
my
father
would
think
speak
or
act
upon
any
untried
occasion
or
occurrence
of
there
was
that
infinitude
of
oddities
in
him
and
of
chances
along
with
it
by
which
handle
he
would
take
a
thing
it
baffled
sir
all
the
truth
was
his
road
lay
so
very
far
on
one
side
from
that
wherein
most
men
travelled
that
every
object
before
him
presented
a
face
and
section
of
itself
to
his
eye
altogether
different
from
the
plan
and
elevation
of
it
seen
by
the
rest
of
in
other
words
a
different
object
and
in
course
was
differently
considered
this
is
the
true
reason
that
my
dear
jenny
and
i
as
well
as
all
the
world
besides
us
have
such
eternal
squabbles
about
she
looks
at
her
outside
i
at
her
in
how
is
it
possible
we
should
agree
about
her
value
chapter
is
a
point
settled
and
i
mention
it
for
the
comfort
of
confucius
mr
shandy
is
supposed
to
mean
esq
member
for
and
not
the
chinese
legislator
who
is
apt
to
get
entangled
in
telling
a
plain
story
that
provided
he
keeps
along
the
line
of
his
story
he
may
go
backwards
and
forwards
as
he
will
is
still
held
to
be
no
digression
this
being
premised
i
take
the
benefit
of
the
act
of
going
backwards
myself
chapter
fifty
thousand
pannier
loads
of
devils
not
of
the
archbishop
of
benevento
i
mean
of
rabelais
devils
with
their
tails
chopped
off
by
their
rumps
could
not
have
made
so
diabolical
a
scream
of
it
as
i
did
when
the
accident
befel
me
it
summoned
up
my
mother
instantly
into
the
nursery
so
that
susannah
had
but
just
time
to
make
her
escape
down
the
back
stairs
as
my
mother
came
up
the
fore
now
though
i
was
old
enough
to
have
told
the
story
myself
and
young
enough
i
hope
to
have
done
it
without
malignity
yet
susannah
in
passing
by
the
kitchen
for
fear
of
accidents
had
left
it
in
with
the
cook
the
cook
had
told
it
with
a
commentary
to
jonathan
and
jonathan
to
obadiah
so
that
by
the
time
my
father
had
rung
the
bell
half
a
dozen
times
to
know
what
was
the
matter
above
was
obadiah
enabled
to
give
him
a
particular
account
of
it
just
as
it
had
i
thought
as
much
said
my
father
tucking
up
his
and
so
walked
up
stairs
one
would
imagine
from
this
though
for
my
own
part
i
somewhat
question
it
that
my
father
before
that
time
had
actually
wrote
that
remarkable
character
in
the
which
to
me
is
the
most
original
and
entertaining
one
in
the
whole
book
and
that
is
the
chapter
upon
with
a
bitter
philippick
at
the
end
of
it
upon
the
forgetfulness
of
i
have
but
two
reasons
for
thinking
otherwise
first
had
the
matter
been
taken
into
consideration
before
the
event
happened
my
father
certainly
would
have
nailed
up
the
sash
window
for
good
an
all
which
considering
with
what
difficulty
he
composed
books
he
might
have
done
with
ten
times
less
trouble
than
he
could
have
wrote
the
chapter
this
argument
i
foresee
holds
good
against
his
writing
a
chapter
even
after
the
event
but
is
obviated
under
the
second
reason
which
i
have
the
honour
to
offer
to
the
world
in
support
of
my
opinion
that
my
father
did
not
write
the
chapter
upon
and
at
the
time
supposed
and
it
is
this
that
in
order
to
render
the
complete
i
wrote
the
chapter
myself
chapter
my
father
put
on
his
spectacles
looked
took
them
off
put
them
into
the
case
all
in
less
than
a
statutable
minute
and
without
opening
his
lips
turned
about
and
walked
precipitately
down
stairs
my
mother
imagined
he
had
stepped
down
for
lint
and
basilicon
but
seeing
him
return
with
a
couple
of
folios
under
his
arm
and
obadiah
following
him
with
a
large
she
took
it
for
granted
was
an
herbal
and
so
drew
him
a
chair
to
the
bedside
that
he
might
consult
upon
the
case
at
his
ease
if
it
be
but
right
done
said
my
father
turning
to
the
section
de
sede
vel
subjecto
circumcisionis
for
he
had
brought
up
spenser
de
legibus
hebraeorum
ritualibus
and
maimonides
in
order
to
confront
and
examine
us
if
it
be
but
right
done
quoth
he
only
tell
us
cried
my
mother
interrupting
him
what
herbs
for
that
replied
my
father
you
must
send
for
slop
my
mother
went
down
and
my
father
went
on
reading
the
section
as
follows
very
well
said
my
father
nay
if
it
has
that
convenience
and
so
without
stopping
a
moment
to
settle
it
first
in
his
mind
whether
the
jews
had
it
from
the
egyptians
or
the
egyptians
from
the
jews
he
rose
up
and
rubbing
his
forehead
two
or
three
times
across
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
in
the
manner
we
rub
out
the
footsteps
of
care
when
evil
has
trod
lighter
upon
us
than
we
foreboded
he
shut
the
book
and
walked
down
nay
said
he
mentioning
the
name
of
a
different
great
nation
upon
every
step
as
he
set
his
foot
upon
it
if
the
egyptians
the
syrians
the
phoenicians
the
arabians

my

his
rank
with
my

toby
in
coming
through
the
narrow
entry
and
so
had
stept
first
into
the

this
tristram
of
ours

find

very
hardly

all
his

my

when
this

of
mine
was

my

my

the
better

said
yorick
you
travel
him
into

answered
my

have
the
advantage
when
he
sees
the
now
every

my

my

though
the

turning
to
yorick
are
greatly

no

my

i

not
by
what
article
of
war
he
could
justify
it
the
controvertists
answered
my
father
assign
different
reasons
for
it
others
indeed
who
have
drawn
their
pens
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
question
have
shewn
the
world
the
futility
of
the
greatest
part
of
but
then
again
our
best
polemic
divines
i
wish
there
was
not
a

yorick
quoth
my

do
tell
me
what
a
polemic

is
the
best
description
captain
shandy
i
have
ever
read
is
of
a
couple
of
replied
yorick
in
the
account
of
the
battle
fought
single
hands
betwixt
gymnast
and
captain
tripet
which
i
have
in
my
i
beg
i
may
hear
it
quoth
my
uncle
toby
you
shall
said
and
as
the
corporal
is
waiting
for
me
at
the
door
and
i
know
the
description
of
a
battle
will
do
the
poor
fellow
more
good
than
his
supper
i
beg
brother
you
give
him
leave
to
come
with
all
my
soul
said
my
trim
came
in
erect
and
happy
as
an
emperor
and
having
shut
the
door
yorick
took
a
book
from
his
and
read
or
pretended
to
read
as
follows
chapter
words
being
heard
by
all
the
soldiers
which
were
there
divers
of
them
being
inwardly
terrified
did
shrink
back
and
make
room
for
the
assailant
all
this
did
gymnast
very
well
remark
and
consider
and
therefore
making
as
if
he
would
have
alighted
from
off
his
horse
as
he
was
poising
himself
on
the
mounting
side
he
most
nimbly
with
his
short
sword
by
this
thigh
shifting
his
feet
in
the
stirrup
and
performing
the
feat
whereby
after
the
inclining
of
his
body
downwards
he
forthwith
launched
himself
aloft
into
the
air
and
placed
both
his
feet
together
upon
the
saddle
standing
upright
with
his
back
turned
towards
his
horse
head
now
said
he
my
case
goes
forward
then
suddenly
in
the
same
posture
wherein
he
was
he
fetched
a
gambol
upon
one
foot
and
turning
to
the
failed
not
to
carry
his
body
perfectly
round
just
into
his
former
position
without
missing
one
ha
said
tripet
i
will
not
do
that
at
this
time
and
not
without
cause
well
said
gymnast
i
have
failed
i
will
undo
this
leap
then
with
a
marvellous
strength
and
agility
turning
towards
the
he
fetched
another
striking
gambol
as
before
which
done
he
set
his
right
hand
thumb
upon
the
bow
of
the
saddle
raised
himself
up
and
sprung
into
the
air
poising
and
upholding
his
whole
weight
upon
the
muscle
and
nerve
of
the
said
thumb
and
so
turned
and
whirled
himself
about
three
times
at
the
fourth
reversing
his
body
and
overturning
it
upside
down
and
foreside
back
without
touching
any
thing
he
brought
himself
betwixt
the
horse
two
ears
and
then
giving
himself
a
jerking
swing
he
seated
himself
upon
the
crupper
this
ca
be
fighting
said
my
uncle
the
corporal
shook
his
head
at
have
patience
said
yorick
tripet
pass
his
right
leg
over
his
saddle
and
placed
himself
en
but
said
he
better
for
me
to
get
into
the
saddle
then
putting
the
thumbs
of
both
hands
upon
the
crupper
before
him
and
leaning
himself
as
upon
the
only
supporters
of
his
body
he
incontinently
turned
heels
over
head
in
the
air
and
strait
found
himself
betwixt
the
bow
of
the
saddle
in
a
tolerable
seat
then
springing
into
the
air
with
a
summerset
he
turned
him
about
like
a
and
made
above
a
hundred
frisks
turns
and
good
god
cried
trim
losing
all
patience
one
home
thrust
of
a
bayonet
is
worth
it
i
think
so
too
replied
i
am
of
a
contrary
opinion
quoth
my
father
chapter
no
i
think
i
have
advanced
nothing
replied
my
father
making
answer
to
a
question
which
yorick
had
taken
the
liberty
to
put
to
him
i
have
advanced
nothing
in
the
but
what
is
as
clear
as
any
one
proposition
in
reach
me
trim
that
book
from
off
the
scrutoir
it
has
been
in
my
mind
continued
my
father
to
have
read
it
over
both
to
you
yorick
and
to
my
brother
toby
and
i
think
it
a
little
unfriendly
in
myself
in
not
having
done
it
long
ago
shall
we
have
a
short
chapter
or
two
now
and
a
chapter
or
two
hereafter
as
occasions
serve
and
so
on
till
we
get
through
the
whole
my
uncle
toby
and
yorick
made
the
obeisance
which
was
proper
and
the
corporal
though
he
was
not
included
in
the
compliment
laid
his
hand
upon
his
breast
and
made
his
bow
at
the
same
the
company
smiled
trim
quoth
my
father
has
paid
the
full
price
for
staying
out
the
he
did
not
seem
to
relish
the
play
replied
was
a
an
please
your
reverence
of
captain
tripet
and
that
other
officer
making
so
many
summersets
as
they
advanced
the
french
come
on
capering
now
and
then
in
that
way
but
not
quite
so
much
my
uncle
toby
never
felt
the
consciousness
of
his
existence
with
more
complacency
than
what
the
corporal
and
his
own
reflections
made
him
do
at
that
moment
he
lighted
his
pipe
yorick
drew
his
chair
closer
to
the
table
trim
snuff
the
candle
my
father
stirr
up
the
fire
took
up
the
book
cough
twice
and
begun
chapter
the
first
thirty
pages
said
my
father
turning
over
the
leaves
are
a
little
dry
and
as
they
are
not
closely
connected
with
the
subject
for
the
present
we
pass
them
by
is
a
prefatory
introduction
continued
my
father
or
an
introductory
preface
for
i
am
not
determined
which
name
to
give
it
upon
political
or
civil
government
the
foundation
of
which
being
laid
in
the
first
conjunction
betwixt
male
and
female
for
procreation
of
the
species
i
was
insensibly
led
into
was
natural
said
yorick
the
original
of
society
continued
my
father
i
satisfied
is
what
politian
tells
us
merely
conjugal
and
nothing
more
than
the
getting
together
of
one
man
and
one
woman
to
which
according
to
hesiod
the
philosopher
adds
a
servant
but
supposing
in
the
first
beginning
there
were
no
men
servants
born
he
lays
the
foundation
of
it
in
a
man
a
woman
and
a
i
believe
is
an
ox
quoth
yorick
quoting
the
passage
greek
a
bull
must
have
given
more
trouble
than
his
head
was
but
there
is
a
better
reason
still
said
my
father
dipping
his
pen
into
his
ink
for
the
ox
being
the
most
patient
of
animals
and
the
most
useful
withal
in
tilling
the
ground
for
their
nourishment
was
the
properest
instrument
and
emblem
too
for
the
new
joined
couple
that
the
creation
could
have
associated
with
and
there
is
a
stronger
reason
added
my
uncle
toby
than
them
all
for
the
my
father
had
not
power
to
take
his
pen
out
of
his
till
he
had
heard
my
uncle
toby
for
when
the
ground
was
tilled
said
my
uncle
toby
and
made
worth
inclosing
then
they
began
to
secure
it
by
walls
and
ditches
which
was
the
origin
of
true
true
dear
toby
cried
my
father
striking
out
the
bull
and
putting
the
ox
in
his
place
my
father
gave
trim
a
nod
to
snuff
the
candle
and
resumed
his
discourse
i
enter
upon
this
speculation
said
my
father
carelessly
and
half
shutting
the
book
as
he
went
on
merely
to
shew
the
foundation
of
the
natural
relation
between
a
father
and
his
child
the
right
and
jurisdiction
over
whom
he
acquires
these
several
ways
by
marriage
by
adoption
by
legitimation
and
by
procreation
all
which
i
consider
in
their
order
i
lay
a
slight
stress
upon
one
of
them
replied
yorick
the
act
especially
where
it
ends
there
in
my
opinion
lays
as
little
obligation
upon
the
child
as
it
conveys
power
to
the
you
are
wrong
said
my
father
argutely
and
for
this
plain
reason
i
own
added
my
father
that
the
offspring
upon
this
account
is
not
so
under
the
power
and
jurisdiction
of
the
but
the
reason
replied
yorick
equally
holds
good
for
she
is
under
authority
herself
said
my
father
and
besides
continued
my
father
nodding
his
head
and
laying
his
finger
upon
the
side
of
his
nose
as
he
assigned
his
reason
she
is
not
the
principal
agent
in
what
quoth
my
uncle
toby
stopping
his
though
by
all
means
added
my
father
not
attending
to
my
uncle
toby
son
ought
to
pay
her
respect
as
you
may
read
yorick
at
large
in
the
first
book
of
the
institutes
of
justinian
at
the
eleventh
title
and
the
tenth
i
can
read
it
as
well
replied
yorick
in
the
catechism
chapter
trim
can
repeat
every
word
of
it
by
heart
quoth
my
uncle
pugh
said
my
father
not
caring
to
be
interrupted
with
trim
saying
his
catechism
he
can
upon
my
honour
replied
my
uncle
ask
him
yorick
any
question
you
the
fifth
commandment
trim
said
yorick
speaking
mildly
and
with
a
gentle
nod
as
to
a
modest
catechumen
the
corporal
stood
you
do
ask
him
right
said
my
uncle
toby
raising
his
voice
and
giving
it
rapidly
like
the
word
of
command
the
fifth
cried
my
uncle
i
must
begin
with
the
first
an
please
your
honour
said
the
yorick
could
not
forbear
your
reverence
does
not
consider
said
the
corporal
shouldering
his
stick
like
a
musket
and
marching
into
the
middle
of
the
room
to
illustrate
his
position
that
is
exactly
the
same
thing
as
doing
one
exercise
in
the
your
to
your
firelock
cried
the
corporal
giving
the
word
of
command
and
performing
the
your
firelock
cried
the
corporal
doing
the
duty
still
both
of
adjutant
and
private
man
your
firelock
one
motion
an
please
your
reverence
you
see
leads
into
if
his
honour
will
begin
but
with
the
first
the
first
cried
my
uncle
toby
setting
his
hand
upon
his
side
the
second
cried
my
uncle
toby
waving
his
as
he
would
have
done
his
sword
at
the
head
of
a
the
corporal
went
through
his
manual
with
exactness
and
having
honoured
his
father
and
mother
made
a
low
bow
and
fell
back
to
the
side
of
the
room
every
thing
in
this
world
said
my
father
is
big
with
jest
and
has
wit
in
it
and
instruction
too
if
we
can
but
find
it
out
here
is
the
scaffold
work
of
instruction
its
true
point
of
folly
without
the
building
behind
it
here
is
the
glass
for
pedagogues
preceptors
tutors
governors
and
to
view
themselves
in
in
their
true
oh
there
is
a
husk
and
shell
yorick
which
grows
up
with
learning
which
their
unskilfulness
knows
not
how
to
fling
away
sciences
may
be
learned
by
rote
but
wisdom
not
yorick
thought
my
father
i
will
enter
into
obligations
this
moment
said
my
father
to
lay
out
all
my
aunt
dinah
legacy
in
charitable
uses
of
which
by
the
bye
my
father
had
no
high
opinion
if
the
corporal
has
any
one
determinate
idea
annexed
to
any
one
word
he
has
prithee
trim
quoth
my
father
turning
round
to
him
what
dost
thou
mean
by
thy
father
and
mother
allowing
them
an
please
your
honour
three
halfpence
a
day
out
of
my
pay
when
they
grow
and
didst
thou
do
that
trim
said
he
did
indeed
replied
my
uncle
then
trim
said
yorick
springing
out
of
his
chair
and
taking
the
corporal
by
the
hand
thou
art
the
best
commentator
upon
that
part
of
the
decalogue
and
i
honour
thee
more
for
it
corporal
trim
than
if
thou
hadst
had
a
hand
in
the
talmud
itself
chapter
o
blessed
health
cried
my
father
making
an
exclamation
as
he
turned
over
the
leaves
to
the
next
chapter
thou
art
before
all
gold
and
treasure
is
thou
who
enlargest
the
soul
and
openest
all
its
powers
to
receive
instruction
and
to
relish
he
that
has
thee
has
little
more
to
wish
for
and
he
that
is
so
wretched
as
to
want
thee
wants
every
thing
with
thee
i
have
concentrated
all
that
can
be
said
upon
this
important
head
said
my
father
into
a
very
little
room
therefore
we
read
the
chapter
quite
through
my
father
read
as
follows
whole
secret
of
health
depending
upon
the
due
contention
for
mastery
betwixt
the
radical
heat
and
the
radical
moisture
you
have
proved
that
matter
of
fact
i
suppose
above
said
yorick
sufficiently
replied
my
father
in
saying
this
my
father
shut
the
book
not
as
if
he
resolved
to
read
no
more
of
it
for
he
kept
his
in
the
chapter
nor
pettishly
for
he
shut
the
book
slowly
his
thumb
resting
when
he
had
done
it
upon
the
of
the
cover
as
his
three
fingers
supported
the
lower
side
of
it
without
the
least
compressive
i
have
demonstrated
the
truth
of
that
point
quoth
my
father
nodding
to
yorick
most
sufficiently
in
the
preceding
chapter
now
could
the
man
in
the
moon
be
told
that
a
man
in
the
earth
had
wrote
a
chapter
sufficiently
demonstrating
that
the
secret
of
all
health
depended
upon
the
due
contention
for
mastery
betwixt
the
radical
heat
and
the
radical
moisture
and
that
he
had
managed
the
point
so
well
that
there
was
not
one
single
word
wet
or
dry
upon
radical
heat
or
radical
moisture
throughout
the
whole
chapter
or
a
single
syllable
in
it
pro
or
con
directly
or
indirectly
upon
the
contention
betwixt
these
two
powers
in
any
part
of
the
animal
oeconomy
thou
eternal
maker
of
all
beings
he
would
cry
striking
his
breast
with
his
right
hand
in
case
he
had
one
whose
power
and
goodness
can
enlarge
the
faculties
of
thy
creatures
to
this
infinite
degree
of
excellence
and
perfection
what
have
we
moonites
done
chapter
with
two
strokes
the
one
at
hippocrates
the
other
at
lord
verulam
did
my
father
achieve
it
the
stroke
at
the
prince
of
physicians
with
which
he
began
was
no
more
than
a
short
insult
upon
his
sorrowful
complaint
of
the
ars
longa
and
vita
life
short
cried
my
father
and
the
art
of
healing
tedious
and
who
are
we
to
thank
for
both
the
one
and
the
other
but
the
ignorance
of
quacks
themselves
and
the
of
chymical
nostrums
and
peripatetic
lumber
with
which
in
all
ages
they
have
first
flatter
the
world
and
at
last
deceived
it
o
my
lord
verulam
cried
my
father
turning
from
hippocrates
and
making
his
second
stroke
at
him
as
the
principal
of
and
the
fittest
to
be
made
an
example
of
to
the
rest
what
shall
i
say
to
thee
my
great
lord
verulam
what
shall
i
say
to
thy
internal
spirit
thy
opium
thy
thy
greasy
unctions
thy
daily
purges
thy
nightly
clysters
and
succedaneums
my
father
was
never
at
a
loss
what
to
say
to
any
man
upon
any
subject
and
had
the
least
occasion
for
the
exordium
of
any
man
breathing
how
he
dealt
with
his
lordship
opinion
you
shall
see
but
when
i
know
not
we
must
first
see
what
his
opinion
was
chapter
two
great
causes
which
conspire
with
each
other
to
shorten
life
says
lord
verulam
are
first
internal
spirit
which
like
a
gentle
flame
wastes
the
body
down
to
death
and
secondly
the
external
air
that
parches
the
body
up
to
ashes
which
two
enemies
attacking
us
on
both
sides
of
our
bodies
together
at
length
destroy
our
organs
and
render
them
unfit
to
carry
on
the
functions
of
life
this
being
the
state
of
the
case
the
road
to
longevity
was
plain
nothing
more
being
required
says
his
lordship
but
to
repair
the
waste
committed
by
the
internal
spirit
by
making
the
substance
of
it
more
thick
and
dense
by
a
regular
course
of
opiates
on
one
side
and
by
refrigerating
the
heat
of
it
on
the
other
by
three
grains
and
a
half
of
every
morning
before
you
got
still
this
frame
of
ours
was
left
exposed
to
the
inimical
assaults
of
the
air
without
but
this
was
fenced
off
again
by
a
course
of
greasy
unctions
which
so
fully
saturated
the
pores
of
the
skin
that
no
spicula
could
enter
nor
could
any
one
get
this
put
a
stop
to
all
perspiration
sensible
and
insensible
which
being
the
cause
of
so
many
scurvy
distempers
a
course
of
clysters
was
requisite
to
carry
off
redundant
humours
and
render
the
system
complete
what
my
father
had
to
say
to
my
lord
of
verulam
opiates
his
and
greasy
unctions
and
clysters
you
shall
read
but
not
or
time
presses
upon
me
my
reader
is
impatient
i
must
get
forwards
you
shall
read
the
chapter
at
your
leisure
if
you
chuse
it
as
soon
as
ever
the
is
sufficeth
it
at
present
to
say
my
father
levelled
the
hypothesis
with
the
ground
and
in
doing
that
the
learned
know
he
built
up
and
established
his
chapter
the
whole
secret
of
health
said
my
father
beginning
the
sentence
again
depending
evidently
upon
the
due
contention
betwixt
the
radical
heat
and
radical
moisture
within
us
the
least
imaginable
skill
had
been
sufficient
to
have
maintained
it
had
not
the
confounded
the
task
merely
as
van
helmont
the
famous
chymist
has
proved
by
all
along
mistaking
the
radical
moisture
for
the
tallow
and
fat
of
animal
bodies
now
the
radical
moisture
is
not
the
tallow
or
fat
of
animals
but
an
oily
and
balsamous
substance
for
the
fat
and
tallow
as
also
the
phlegm
or
watery
parts
are
cold
whereas
the
oily
and
balsamous
parts
are
of
a
lively
heat
and
spirit
which
accounts
for
the
observation
of
aristotle
omne
animal
post
coitum
est
triste
now
it
is
certain
that
the
radical
heat
lives
in
the
radical
moisture
but
whether
vice
versa
is
a
doubt
however
when
the
one
decays
the
other
decays
also
and
then
is
produced
either
an
unnatural
heat
which
causes
an
unnatural
dryness
or
an
unnatural
moisture
which
causes
so
that
if
a
child
as
he
grows
up
can
but
be
taught
to
avoid
running
into
fire
or
water
as
either
of
threaten
his
destruction
be
all
that
is
needful
to
be
done
upon
that
chapter
the
description
of
the
siege
of
jericho
itself
could
not
have
engaged
the
attention
of
my
uncle
toby
more
powerfully
than
the
last
chapter
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
my
father
throughout
it
he
never
mentioned
radical
heat
and
radical
moisture
but
my
uncle
toby
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
shook
his
head
and
as
soon
as
the
chapter
was
finished
he
beckoned
to
the
corporal
to
come
close
to
his
chair
to
ask
him
the
following
question
it
was
at
the
siege
of
limerick
an
please
your
honour
replied
the
corporal
making
a
bow
the
poor
fellow
and
i
quoth
my
uncle
toby
addressing
himself
to
my
father
were
scarce
able
to
crawl
out
of
our
tents
at
the
time
the
siege
of
limerick
was
raised
upon
the
very
account
you
now
what
can
have
got
into
that
precious
noddle
of
thine
my
dear
brother
toby
cried
my
father
by
heaven
continued
he
communing
still
with
himself
it
would
puzzle
an
oedipus
to
bring
it
in
i
believe
an
please
your
honour
quoth
the
corporal
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
quantity
of
brandy
we
set
fire
to
every
night
and
the
claret
and
cinnamon
with
which
i
plyed
your
honour
off
and
the
geneva
trim
added
my
uncle
toby
which
did
us
more
good
than
all
i
verily
believe
continued
the
corporal
we
had
both
an
please
your
honour
left
our
lives
in
the
trenches
and
been
buried
in
them
the
noblest
grave
corporal
cried
my
uncle
toby
his
eyes
sparkling
as
he
spoke
that
a
soldier
could
wish
to
lie
down
but
a
pitiful
death
for
him
an
please
your
honour
replied
the
corporal
all
this
was
as
much
arabick
to
my
father
as
the
rites
of
the
colchi
and
troglodites
had
been
before
to
my
uncle
toby
my
father
could
not
determine
whether
he
was
to
frown
or
to
smile
my
uncle
toby
turning
to
yorick
resumed
the
case
at
limerick
more
intelligibly
than
he
had
begun
it
and
so
settled
the
point
for
my
father
at
once
chapter
it
was
undoubtedly
said
my
uncle
toby
a
great
happiness
for
myself
and
the
corporal
that
we
had
all
along
a
burning
fever
attended
with
a
most
raging
thirst
during
the
whole
days
the
flux
was
upon
us
in
the
camp
otherwise
what
my
brother
calls
the
radical
moisture
must
as
i
conceive
it
inevitably
have
got
the
my
father
drew
in
his
lungs
of
air
and
looking
up
blew
it
forth
again
as
slowly
as
he
possibly
it
was
heaven
mercy
to
us
continued
my
uncle
toby
which
put
it
into
the
corporal
head
to
maintain
that
due
contention
betwixt
the
radical
heat
and
the
radical
moisture
by
reinforceing
the
fever
as
he
did
all
along
with
hot
wine
and
spices
whereby
the
corporal
kept
up
as
it
were
a
continual
firing
so
that
the
radical
heat
stood
its
ground
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
and
was
a
fair
match
for
the
moisture
terrible
as
it
upon
my
honour
added
my
uncle
toby
you
might
have
heard
the
contention
within
our
bodies
brother
shandy
twenty
if
there
was
no
firing
said
yorick
well
said
my
father
with
a
full
aspiration
and
pausing
a
while
after
the
word
was
i
a
judge
and
the
laws
of
the
country
which
made
me
one
permitted
it
i
would
condemn
some
of
the
worst
malefactors
provided
they
had
had
their
clergy
yorick
foreseeing
the
sentence
was
likely
to
end
with
no
sort
of
mercy
laid
his
hand
upon
my
father
breast
and
begged
he
would
respite
it
for
a
few
minutes
till
he
asked
the
corporal
a
prithee
trim
said
yorick
without
staying
for
my
leave
tell
us
honestly
what
is
thy
opinion
concerning
this
radical
heat
and
radical
moisture
with
humble
submission
to
his
honour
better
judgment
quoth
the
corporal
making
a
bow
to
my
uncle
toby
speak
thy
opinion
freely
corporal
said
my
uncle
the
poor
fellow
is
my
servant
not
my
slave
added
my
uncle
toby
turning
to
my
the
corporal
put
his
hat
under
his
left
arm
and
with
his
stick
hanging
upon
the
wrist
of
it
by
a
black
thong
split
into
a
tassel
about
the
knot
he
marched
up
to
the
ground
where
he
had
performed
his
catechism
then
touching
his
with
the
thumb
and
fingers
of
his
right
hand
before
he
opened
his
mouth
he
delivered
his
notion
thus
chapter
just
as
the
corporal
was
humming
to
begin
in
waddled
dr
is
not
matter
the
corporal
shall
go
on
in
the
next
chapter
let
who
will
come
well
my
good
doctor
cried
my
father
sportively
for
the
transitions
of
his
passions
were
unaccountably
sudden
and
what
has
this
whelp
of
mine
to
say
to
the
matter
had
my
father
been
asking
after
the
amputation
of
the
tail
of
a
he
could
not
have
done
it
in
a
more
careless
air
the
system
which
slop
had
laid
down
to
treat
the
accident
by
no
way
allowed
of
such
a
mode
of
he
sat
down
pray
sir
quoth
my
uncle
toby
in
a
manner
which
could
not
go
unanswered
in
what
condition
is
the
boy
end
in
a
phimosis
replied
slop
i
am
no
wiser
than
i
was
quoth
my
uncle
toby
returning
his
pipe
into
his
then
let
the
corporal
go
on
said
my
father
with
his
medical
the
corporal
made
a
bow
to
his
old
friend
slop
and
then
delivered
his
opinion
concerning
radical
heat
and
radical
moisture
in
the
following
words
chapter
the
city
of
limerick
the
siege
of
which
was
begun
under
his
majesty
king
william
himself
the
year
after
i
went
into
the
army
lies
an
please
your
honours
in
the
middle
of
a
devilish
wet
swampy
is
quite
surrounded
said
my
uncle
toby
with
the
shannon
and
is
by
its
situation
one
of
the
strongest
fortified
places
in
i
think
this
is
a
new
fashion
quoth
slop
of
beginning
a
medical
is
all
true
answered
then
i
wish
the
faculty
would
follow
the
cut
of
it
said
is
all
cut
through
an
please
your
reverence
said
the
corporal
with
drains
and
bogs
and
besides
there
was
such
a
quantity
of
rain
fell
during
the
siege
the
whole
country
was
like
a
puddle
was
that
and
nothing
else
which
brought
on
the
flux
and
which
had
like
to
have
killed
both
his
honour
and
myself
now
there
was
no
such
thing
after
the
first
ten
days
continued
the
corporal
for
a
soldier
to
lie
dry
in
his
tent
without
cutting
a
ditch
round
it
to
draw
off
the
water
nor
was
that
enough
for
those
who
could
afford
it
as
his
honour
could
without
setting
fire
every
night
to
a
pewter
dish
full
of
brandy
which
took
off
the
damp
of
the
air
and
made
the
inside
of
the
tent
as
warm
as
a
and
what
conclusion
dost
thou
draw
corporal
trim
cried
my
father
from
all
these
premises
i
infer
an
please
your
worship
replied
trim
that
the
radical
moisture
is
nothing
in
the
world
but
and
that
the
radical
heat
of
those
who
can
go
to
the
expence
of
it
is
burnt
brandy
the
radical
heat
and
moisture
of
a
private
man
an
please
your
honour
is
nothing
but
and
a
dram
of
geneva
and
give
us
but
enough
of
it
with
a
pipe
of
tobacco
to
give
us
spirits
and
drive
away
the
vapours
we
know
not
what
it
is
to
fear
death
i
am
at
a
loss
captain
shandy
quoth
doctor
slop
to
determine
in
which
branch
of
learning
your
servant
shines
most
whether
in
physiology
or
slop
had
not
forgot
trim
comment
upon
the
it
is
but
an
hour
ago
replied
yorick
since
the
corporal
was
examined
in
the
latter
and
passed
muster
with
great
the
radical
heat
and
moisture
quoth
doctor
slop
turning
to
my
father
you
must
know
is
the
basis
and
foundation
of
our
being
as
the
root
of
a
tree
is
the
source
and
principle
of
its
it
is
inherent
in
the
seeds
of
all
animals
and
may
be
preserved
sundry
ways
but
principally
in
my
opinion
by
consubstantials
impriments
and
now
this
poor
fellow
continued
slop
pointing
to
the
corporal
has
had
the
misfortune
to
have
heard
some
superficial
empiric
discourse
upon
this
nice
that
he
has
said
my
very
likely
said
my
i
sure
of
it
quoth
chapter
doctor
slop
being
called
out
to
look
at
a
cataplasm
he
had
ordered
it
gave
my
father
an
opportunity
of
going
on
with
another
chapter
in
the
come
cheer
up
my
lads
i
shew
you
land
for
when
we
have
tugged
through
that
chapter
the
book
shall
not
be
opened
again
this
huzza
chapter
five
years
with
a
bib
under
his
chin
four
years
in
travelling
from
to
malachi
a
year
and
a
half
in
learning
to
write
his
own
name
seven
long
years
and
more
greek
it
at
greek
and
latin
four
years
at
his
probations
and
his
negations
the
fine
statue
still
lying
in
the
middle
of
the
marble
block
and
nothing
done
but
his
tools
sharpened
to
hew
it
out
is
a
piteous
delay
was
not
the
great
julius
scaliger
within
an
ace
of
never
getting
his
tools
sharpened
at
all
years
old
was
he
before
he
could
manage
his
greek
and
peter
damianus
lord
bishop
of
ostia
as
all
the
world
knows
could
not
so
much
as
read
when
he
was
of
man
and
baldus
himself
as
eminent
as
he
turned
out
after
entered
upon
the
law
so
late
in
life
that
every
body
imagined
he
intended
to
be
an
advocate
in
the
other
world
no
wonder
when
eudamidas
the
son
of
archidamas
heard
xenocrates
at
disputing
about
wisdom
that
he
asked
gravely
if
the
old
man
be
yet
disputing
and
enquiring
concerning
wisdom
what
time
will
he
have
to
make
use
of
it
yorick
listened
to
my
father
with
great
attention
there
was
a
seasoning
of
wisdom
unaccountably
mixed
up
with
his
strangest
whims
and
he
had
sometimes
such
illuminations
in
the
darkest
of
his
eclipses
as
almost
atoned
for
them
be
wary
sir
when
you
imitate
him
i
am
convinced
yorick
continued
my
father
half
reading
and
half
discoursing
that
there
is
a
passage
to
the
intellectual
world
and
that
the
soul
of
man
has
shorter
ways
of
going
to
work
in
furnishing
itself
with
knowledge
and
instruction
than
we
generally
take
with
but
alack
all
fields
have
not
a
river
or
a
spring
running
besides
them
every
child
yorick
has
not
a
parent
to
point
it
out
the
whole
entirely
depends
added
my
father
in
a
low
voice
upon
the
auxiliary
verbs
yorick
had
yorick
trod
upon
virgil
snake
he
could
not
have
looked
more
i
am
surprised
too
cried
my
father
observing
it
and
i
reckon
it
as
one
of
the
greatest
calamities
which
ever
befel
the
republic
of
letters
that
those
who
have
been
entrusted
with
the
education
of
our
children
and
whose
business
it
was
to
open
their
minds
and
stock
them
early
with
ideas
in
order
to
set
the
imagination
loose
upon
them
have
made
so
little
use
of
the
auxiliary
verbs
in
doing
it
as
they
have
done
so
that
except
raymond
lullius
and
the
elder
pelegrini
the
last
of
which
arrived
to
such
perfection
in
the
use
of
with
his
topics
that
in
a
few
lessons
he
could
teach
a
young
gentleman
to
discourse
with
plausibility
upon
any
subject
pro
and
con
and
to
say
and
write
all
that
could
be
spoken
or
written
concerning
it
without
blotting
a
word
to
the
admiration
of
all
who
beheld
i
should
be
glad
said
yorick
interrupting
my
father
to
be
made
to
comprehend
this
matter
you
shall
said
my
father
the
highest
stretch
of
improvement
a
single
word
is
capable
of
is
a
high
metaphor
for
which
in
my
opinion
the
idea
is
generally
the
worse
and
not
the
better
but
be
that
as
it
may
when
the
mind
has
done
that
with
it
there
is
an
end
the
mind
and
the
idea
are
at
rest
until
a
second
idea
enters
and
so
on
now
the
use
of
the
auxiliaries
is
at
once
to
set
the
soul
by
herself
upon
the
materials
as
they
are
brought
her
and
by
the
versability
of
this
great
engine
round
which
they
are
twisted
to
open
new
tracts
of
enquiry
and
make
every
idea
engender
millions
you
excite
my
curiosity
greatly
said
yorick
for
my
own
part
quoth
my
uncle
toby
i
have
given
it
the
danes
an
please
your
honour
quoth
the
corporal
who
were
on
the
left
at
the
siege
of
limerick
were
all
and
very
good
ones
said
my
uncle
but
the
auxiliaries
trim
my
brother
is
talking
about
i
conceive
to
be
different
you
do
said
my
father
rising
up
chapter
my
father
took
a
single
turn
across
the
room
then
sat
down
and
finished
the
chapter
the
verbs
auxiliary
we
are
concerned
in
here
continued
my
father
are
am
was
have
had
do
did
make
made
suffer
shall
should
will
would
can
could
owe
ought
used
or
is
and
these
varied
with
tenses
present
past
future
and
conjugated
with
the
verb
see
or
with
these
questions
added
to
them
is
it
was
it
will
it
be
would
it
be
may
it

might
it

and
these
again
put
negatively
is
it
not
was
it
not
ought
it
not
or
affirmatively
it
is
it
was
it
ought
to
be
or
chronologically
has
it
been
always
lately
how
long
ago
or
hypothetically
if
it
was
if
it
was
not
what
would
follow
if
the
french
should
beat
the
english
if
the
sun
go
out
of
the
zodiac
now
by
the
right
use
and
application
of
these
continued
my
father
in
which
a
child
memory
should
be
exercised
there
is
no
one
idea
can
enter
his
brain
how
barren
soever
but
a
magazine
of
conceptions
and
conclusions
may
be
drawn
forth
from
didst
thou
ever
see
a
white
bear
cried
my
father
turning
his
head
round
to
trim
who
stood
at
the
back
of
his
chair
no
an
please
your
honour
replied
the
but
thou
couldst
discourse
about
one
trim
said
my
father
in
case
of
need
how
is
it
possible
brother
quoth
my
uncle
toby
if
the
corporal
never
saw
one
is
the
fact
i
want
replied
my
father
and
the
possibility
of
it
is
as
follows
a
white
bear
very
well
have
i
ever
seen
one
might
i
ever
have
seen
one
am
i
ever
to
see
one
ought
i
ever
to
have
seen
one
or
can
i
ever
see
one
would
i
had
seen
a
white
bear
for
how
can
i
imagine
it
if
i
should
see
a
white
bear
what
should
i
say
if
i
should
never
see
a
white
bear
what
then
if
i
never
have
can
must
or
shall
see
a
white
bear
alive
have
i
ever
seen
the
skin
of
one
did
i
ever
see
one
painted
described
have
i
never
dreamed
of
one
did
my
father
mother
uncle
aunt
brothers
or
sisters
ever
see
a
white
bear
what
would
they
give
how
would
they
behave
how
would
the
white
bear
have
behaved
is
he
wild
tame
terrible
rough
smooth
is
the
white
bear
worth
seeing
is
there
no
sin
in
it
is
it
better
than
a
black

chapter
we
not
stop
two
moments
my
dear
sir
only
as
we
have
got
through
these
five
volumes
in
the
first
edition
the
sixth
volume
began
with
this
chapter
do
sir
sit
down
upon
a
set
they
are
better
than
nothing
let
us
just
look
back
upon
the
country
we
have
what
a
wilderness
has
it
been
and
what
a
mercy
that
we
have
not
both
of
us
been
lost
or
devoured
by
wild
beasts
in
it
did
you
think
the
world
itself
sir
had
contained
such
a
number
of
jack
asses
how
they
view
and
review
us
as
we
passed
over
the
rivulet
at
the
bottom
of
that
little
valley
and
when
we
climbed
over
that
hill
and
were
just
getting
out
of
sight
good
god
what
a
braying
did
they
all
set
up
together
prithee
shepherd
who
keeps
all
those
jack
asses
heaven
be
their
comforter
what
are
they
never
curried
are
they
never
taken
in
in
winter
bray
bray
bray
bray
on
the
world
is
deeply
your
debtor
louder
still
that
nothing
in
good
sooth
you
are
was
i
a
jack
asse
i
solemnly
declare
i
would
bray
in
from
morning
even
unto
night
chapter
when
my
father
had
danced
his
white
bear
backwards
and
forwards
through
half
a
dozen
pages
he
closed
the
book
for
good
an
all
and
in
a
kind
of
triumph
redelivered
it
into
trim
hand
with
a
nod
to
lay
it
upon
the
where
he
found
tristram
said
he
shall
be
made
to
conjugate
every
word
in
the
dictionary
backwards
and
forwards
the
same
way
every
word
yorick
by
this
means
you
see
is
converted
into
a
thesis
or
an
hypothesis
every
thesis
and
hypothesis
have
an
of
propositions
and
each
proposition
has
its
own
consequences
and
conclusions
every
one
of
which
leads
the
mind
on
again
into
fresh
tracks
of
enquiries
and
the
force
of
this
engine
added
my
father
is
incredible
in
opening
a
child
is
enough
brother
shandy
cried
my
uncle
toby
to
burst
it
into
a
thousand
i
presume
said
yorick
smiling
it
must
be
owing
to
this
for
let
logicians
say
what
they
will
it
is
not
to
be
accounted
for
sufficiently
from
the
bare
use
of
the
ten
predicaments
that
the
famous
vincent
quirino
amongst
the
many
other
astonishing
feats
of
his
childhood
of
which
the
cardinal
bembo
has
given
the
world
so
exact
a
story
should
be
able
to
paste
up
in
the
public
schools
at
rome
so
early
as
in
the
eighth
year
of
his
age
no
less
than
four
thousand
five
hundred
and
fifty
different
theses
upon
the
most
abstruse
points
of
the
most
abstruse
theology
and
to
defend
and
maintain
them
in
such
sort
as
to
cramp
and
dumbfound
his
what
is
that
cried
my
father
to
what
is
told
us
of
alphonsus
tostatus
who
almost
in
his
nurse
arms
learned
all
the
sciences
and
liberal
arts
without
being
taught
any
one
of
them
what
shall
we
say
of
the
great
piereskius
that
the
very
man
cried
my
uncle
toby
i
once
told
you
of
brother
shandy
who
walked
a
matter
of
five
hundred
miles
reckoning
from
paris
to
shevling
and
from
shevling
back
again
merely
to
see
stevinus
flying
he
was
a
very
great
man
added
my
uncle
toby
meaning
stevinus
he
was
so
brother
toby
said
my
father
meaning
piereskius
and
had
multiplied
his
ideas
so
fast
and
increased
his
knowledge
to
such
a
prodigious
stock
that
if
we
may
give
credit
to
an
anecdote
concerning
him
which
we
can
not
withhold
here
without
shaking
the
authority
of
all
anecdotes
whatever
at
seven
years
of
age
his
father
committed
entirely
to
his
care
the
education
of
his
younger
brother
a
boy
of
five
years
old
with
the
sole
management
of
all
his
was
the
father
as
wise
as
the
son
quoth
my
uncle
toby
i
should
think
not
said
yorick
but
what
are
these
continued
my
father
breaking
out
in
a
kind
of
enthusiasm
what
are
these
to
those
prodigies
of
childhood
in
grotius
scioppius
heinsius
politian
pascal
joseph
scaliger
ferdinand
de
cordoue
and
others
some
of
which
left
off
their
substantial
forms
at
nine
years
old
or
sooner
and
went
on
reasoning
without
them
others
went
through
their
classics
at
seven
wrote
tragedies
at
eight
ferdinand
de
cordoue
was
so
wise
at
nine
was
thought
the
devil
was
in
him
and
at
venice
gave
such
proofs
of
his
knowledge
and
goodness
that
the
monks
imagined
he
was
antichrist
or
others
were
masters
of
fourteen
languages
at
ten
finished
the
course
of
their
rhetoric
poetry
logic
and
ethics
at
eleven
put
forth
their
commentaries
upon
servius
and
martianus
capella
at
twelve
and
at
thirteen
received
their
degrees
in
philosophy
laws
and
divinity
but
you
forget
the
great
lipsius
quoth
yorick
who
composed
a
work
nous
aurions
quelque
interet
says
baillet
de
montrer
rien
de
ridicule
etoit
veritable
au
moins
dans
le
sens
enigmatique
que
nicius
erythraeus
a
ta
he
de
lui
donner
cet
auteur
dit
que
pour
comprendre
comme
lipse
il
a
pu
composer
un
ouvrage
le
premier
jour
de
sa
vie
il
faut
que
ce
premier
jour
pas
celui
de
sa
naissance
charnelle
mais
celui
au
quel
il
a
commence
de
la
raison
il
veut
que
ete
a
de
neuf
ans
et
il
nous
veut
persuader
que
ce
fut
en
cet
age
que
lipse
fit
un
le
tour
est
ingenieux
the
day
he
was
born
they
should
have
wiped
it
up
said
my
uncle
toby
and
said
no
more
about
it
chapter
when
the
cataplasm
was
ready
a
scruple
of
decorum
had
unseasonably
rose
up
in
susannah
conscience
about
holding
the
candle
whilst
slop
tied
it
on
slop
had
not
treated
susannah
distemper
with
anodynes
and
so
a
quarrel
had
ensued
betwixt
them
oh
oh
said
slop
casting
a
glance
of
undue
freedom
in
face
as
she
declined
the
office
then
i
think
i
know
you
madam
you
know
me
sir
cried
susannah
fastidiously
and
with
a
toss
of
her
head
levelled
evidently
not
at
his
profession
but
at
the
doctor
himself
you
know
me
cried
susannah
doctor
slop
clapped
his
finger
and
his
thumb
instantly
upon
his
nostrils
susannah
spleen
was
ready
to
burst
at
it
is
false
said
come
come
modesty
said
slop
not
a
little
elated
with
the
success
of
his
last
thrust
if
you
wo
hold
the
candle
and
look
you
may
hold
it
and
shut
your
eyes
that
one
of
your
popish
shifts
cried
susannah
is
better
said
slop
with
a
nod
than
no
shift
at
all
young
woman
i
defy
you
sir
cried
susannah
pulling
her
shift
sleeve
below
her
elbow
it
was
almost
impossible
for
two
persons
to
assist
each
other
in
a
surgical
case
with
a
more
splenetic
cordiality
slop
snatched
up
the
cataplasm
susannah
snatched
up
the
candle
a
little
this
way
said
slop
susannah
looking
one
way
and
rowing
another
instantly
set
fire
to
slop
wig
which
being
somewhat
bushy
and
unctuous
withal
was
burnt
out
before
it
was
well
you
impudent
whore
cried
slop
for
what
is
passion
but
a
wild
beast
you
impudent
whore
cried
slop
getting
upright
with
the
cataplasm
in
his
hand
i
never
was
the
destruction
of
any
body
nose
said
susannah
which
is
more
than
you
can
say
is
it
cried
slop
throwing
the
cataplasm
in
her
face
yes
it
is
cried
susannah
returning
the
compliment
with
what
was
left
in
the
pan
chapter
doctor
slop
and
susannah
filed
against
each
other
in
the
parlour
which
done
as
the
cataplasm
had
failed
they
retired
into
the
kitchen
to
prepare
a
fomentation
for
me
and
whilst
that
was
doing
my
father
determined
the
point
as
you
will
read
chapter
you
see
is
high
time
said
my
father
addressing
himself
equally
to
my
uncle
toby
and
yorick
to
take
this
young
creature
out
of
these
hands
and
put
him
into
those
of
a
private
governor
marcus
antoninus
provided
fourteen
governors
all
at
once
to
superintend
his
son
commodus
education
and
in
six
weeks
he
cashiered
five
of
them
i
know
very
well
continued
my
father
that
commodus
mother
was
in
love
with
a
gladiator
at
the
time
of
her
conception
which
accounts
for
a
great
many
of
commodus
cruelties
when
he
became
emperor
but
still
i
am
of
opinion
that
those
five
whom
antoninus
dismissed
did
temper
in
that
short
time
more
hurt
than
the
other
nine
were
able
to
rectify
all
their
lives
long
now
as
i
consider
the
person
who
is
to
be
about
my
son
as
the
mirror
in
which
he
is
to
view
himself
from
morning
to
night
by
which
he
is
to
adjust
his
looks
his
carriage
and
perhaps
the
inmost
sentiments
of
his
heart
i
would
have
one
yorick
if
possible
polished
at
all
points
fit
for
my
child
to
look
this
is
very
good
sense
quoth
my
uncle
toby
to
himself
there
is
continued
my
father
a
certain
mien
and
motion
of
the
body
and
all
its
parts
both
in
acting
and
speaking
which
argues
a
man
well
within
and
i
am
not
at
all
surprised
that
gregory
of
nazianzum
upon
observing
the
hasty
and
untoward
gestures
of
julian
should
foretel
he
would
one
day
become
an
apostate
or
that
ambrose
should
turn
his
amanuensis
out
of
doors
because
of
an
indecent
motion
of
his
head
which
went
backwards
and
forwards
like
a
flail
or
that
democritus
should
conceive
protagoras
to
be
a
scholar
from
seeing
him
bind
up
a
faggot
and
thrusting
as
he
did
it
the
small
twigs
there
are
a
thousand
unnoticed
openings
continued
my
father
which
let
a
penetrating
eye
at
once
into
a
man
soul
and
i
maintain
it
added
he
that
a
man
of
sense
does
not
lay
down
his
hat
in
coming
into
a
room
or
take
it
up
in
going
out
of
it
but
something
escapes
which
discovers
him
it
is
for
these
reasons
continued
my
father
that
the
governor
i
make
choice
of
shall
neither
vid
pellegrina
lisp
or
squint
or
wink
or
talk
loud
or
look
fierce
or
foolish
or
bite
his
lips
or
grind
his
teeth
or
speak
through
his
nose
or
pick
it
or
blow
it
with
his
he
shall
neither
walk
fast
or
slow
or
fold
his
arms
for
that
is
laziness
or
hang
them
down
for
that
is
folly
or
hide
them
in
his
pocket
for
that
is
he
shall
neither
strike
or
pinch
or
tickle
or
bite
or
cut
his
nails
or
hawk
or
spit
or
snift
or
drum
with
his
feet
or
fingers
in
company
nor
according
to
erasmus
shall
he
speak
to
any
one
in
making
water
nor
shall
he
point
to
carrion
or
now
this
is
all
nonsense
again
quoth
my
uncle
toby
to
i
will
have
him
continued
my
father
cheerful
facete
jovial
at
the
same
time
prudent
attentive
to
business
vigilant
acute
argute
inventive
quick
in
resolving
doubts
and
speculative
questions
he
shall
be
wise
and
judicious
and
learned
and
why
not
humble
and
moderate
and
and
good
said
yorick
and
why
not
cried
my
uncle
toby
free
and
generous
and
bountiful
and
brave
he
shall
my
dear
toby
replied
my
father
getting
up
and
shaking
him
by
his
then
brother
shandy
answered
my
uncle
toby
raising
himself
off
the
chair
and
laying
down
his
pipe
to
take
hold
of
my
other
hand
i
humbly
beg
i
may
recommend
poor
le
fever
son
to
you
a
tear
of
joy
of
the
first
water
sparkled
in
my
uncle
toby
eye
and
another
the
fellow
to
it
in
the
corporal
as
the
proposition
was
made
you
will
see
why
when
you
read
le
fever
story
fool
that
i
was
nor
can
i
recollect
nor
perhaps
you
without
turning
back
to
the
place
what
it
was
that
hindered
me
from
letting
the
corporal
tell
it
in
his
own
words
but
the
occasion
is
lost
i
must
tell
it
now
in
my
own
chapter
the
story
of
le
fever
it
was
some
time
in
the
summer
of
that
year
in
which
dendermond
was
taken
by
the
allies
which
was
about
seven
years
before
my
father
came
into
the
country
and
about
as
many
after
the
time
that
my
uncle
toby
and
trim
had
privately
decamped
from
my
father
house
in
town
in
order
to
lay
some
of
the
finest
sieges
to
some
of
the
finest
fortified
cities
in
europe
when
my
uncle
toby
was
one
evening
getting
his
supper
with
trim
sitting
behind
him
at
a
small
sideboard
i
say
sitting
for
in
consideration
of
the
corporal
lame
knee
which
sometimes
gave
him
exquisite
pain
when
my
uncle
toby
dined
or
supped
alone
he
would
never
suffer
the
corporal
to
stand
and
the
poor
fellow
veneration
for
his
master
was
such
that
with
a
proper
artillery
my
uncle
toby
could
have
taken
dendermond
itself
with
less
trouble
than
he
was
able
to
gain
this
point
over
him
for
many
a
time
when
my
uncle
toby
supposed
the
corporal
leg
was
at
rest
he
would
look
back
and
detect
him
standing
behind
him
with
the
most
dutiful
respect
this
bred
more
little
squabbles
betwixt
them
than
all
other
causes
for
years
together
but
this
is
neither
here
nor
there
why
do
i
mention
it
ask
my
pen
it
governs
me
i
govern
not
it
he
was
one
evening
sitting
thus
at
his
supper
when
the
landlord
of
a
little
inn
in
the
village
came
into
the
parlour
with
an
empty
phial
in
his
hand
to
beg
a
glass
or
two
of
sack
is
for
a
poor
gentleman
i
think
of
the
army
said
the
landlord
who
has
been
taken
ill
at
my
house
four
days
ago
and
has
never
held
up
his
head
since
or
had
a
desire
to
taste
any
thing
till
just
now
that
he
has
a
fancy
for
a
glass
of
sack
and
a
thin
toast
i
think
says
he
taking
his
hand
from
his
forehead
it
would
comfort
if
i
could
neither
beg
borrow
or
buy
such
a
thing
added
the
landlord
i
would
almost
steal
it
for
the
poor
gentleman
he
is
so
i
hope
in
god
he
will
still
mend
continued
he
we
are
all
of
us
concerned
for
him
thou
art
a
soul
i
will
answer
for
thee
cried
my
uncle
toby
and
thou
shalt
drink
the
poor
gentleman
health
in
a
glass
of
sack
thyself
and
take
a
couple
of
bottles
with
my
service
and
tell
him
he
is
heartily
welcome
to
them
and
to
a
dozen
more
if
they
will
do
him
good
though
i
am
persuaded
said
my
uncle
toby
as
the
landlord
shut
the
door
he
is
a
very
compassionate
fellow
trim
yet
i
can
not
help
entertaining
a
high
opinion
of
his
guest
too
there
must
be
something
more
than
common
in
him
that
in
so
short
a
time
should
win
so
much
upon
the
affections
of
his
host
and
of
his
whole
family
added
the
corporal
for
they
are
all
concerned
for
him
step
after
him
said
my
uncle
toby
do
trim
and
ask
if
he
knows
his
name
i
have
quite
forgot
it
truly
said
the
landlord
coming
back
into
the
parlour
with
the
corporal
but
i
can
ask
his
son
again
has
he
a
son
with
him
then
said
my
uncle
a
boy
replied
the
landlord
of
about
eleven
or
twelve
years
of
age
but
the
poor
creature
has
tasted
almost
as
little
as
his
father
he
does
nothing
but
mourn
and
lament
for
him
night
and
day
he
has
not
stirred
from
the
these
two
days
my
uncle
toby
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
thrust
his
plate
from
before
him
as
the
landlord
gave
him
the
account
and
trim
without
being
ordered
took
away
without
saying
one
word
and
in
a
few
minutes
after
brought
him
his
pipe
and
tobacco
stay
in
the
room
a
little
said
my
uncle
toby
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
after
he
lighted
his
pipe
and
smoak
about
a
dozen
trim
came
in
front
of
his
master
and
made
his
bow
my
uncle
toby
smoak
on
and
said
no
corporal
said
my
uncle
toby
the
corporal
made
his
my
uncle
toby
proceeded
no
farther
but
finished
his
pipe
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
i
have
a
project
in
my
head
as
it
is
a
bad
night
of
wrapping
myself
up
warm
in
my
roquelaure
and
paying
a
visit
to
this
poor
your
honour
roquelaure
replied
the
corporal
has
not
once
been
had
on
since
the
night
before
your
honour
received
your
wound
when
we
mounted
guard
in
the
trenches
before
the
gate
of
nicholas
and
besides
it
is
so
cold
and
rainy
a
night
that
what
with
the
roquelaure
and
what
with
the
weather
be
enough
to
give
your
honour
your
death
and
bring
on
your
honour
torment
in
your
groin
i
fear
so
replied
my
uncle
toby
but
i
am
not
at
rest
in
my
mind
trim
since
the
account
the
landlord
has
given
i
wish
i
had
not
known
so
much
of
this
affair
added
my
uncle
toby
or
that
i
had
known
more
of
it
how
shall
we
manage
it
leave
it
a
please
your
honour
to
me
quoth
the
corporal
i
take
my
hat
and
stick
and
go
to
the
house
and
reconnoitre
and
act
accordingly
and
i
will
bring
your
honour
a
full
account
in
an
thou
shalt
go
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
and
a
shilling
for
thee
to
drink
with
his
i
shall
get
it
all
out
of
him
said
the
corporal
shutting
the
door
my
uncle
toby
filled
his
second
pipe
and
had
it
not
been
that
he
now
and
then
wandered
from
the
point
with
considering
whether
it
was
not
full
as
well
to
have
the
curtain
of
the
tennaile
a
straight
line
as
a
crooked
one
he
might
be
said
to
have
thought
of
nothing
else
but
poor
le
fever
and
his
boy
the
whole
time
he
smoaked
it
chapter
the
story
of
le
fever
continued
it
was
not
till
my
uncle
toby
had
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
third
pipe
that
corporal
trim
returned
from
the
inn
and
gave
him
the
following
account
i
despaired
at
first
said
the
corporal
of
being
able
to
bring
back
your
honour
any
kind
of
intelligence
concerning
the
poor
sick
lieutenant
is
he
in
the
army
then
said
my
uncle
toby
he
is
said
the
corporal
and
in
what
regiment
said
my
uncle
toby
i
tell
your
honour
replied
the
corporal
every
thing
straight
forwards
as
i
learnt
then
trim
i
fill
another
pipe
said
my
uncle
toby
and
not
interrupt
thee
till
thou
hast
done
so
sit
down
at
thy
ease
trim
in
the
and
begin
thy
story
again
the
corporal
made
his
old
bow
which
generally
spoke
as
plain
as
a
bow
could
speak
it
your
honour
is
good
and
having
done
that
he
sat
down
as
he
was
ordered
and
begun
the
story
to
my
uncle
toby
over
again
in
pretty
near
the
same
words
i
despaired
at
first
said
the
corporal
of
being
able
to
bring
back
any
intelligence
to
your
honour
about
the
lieutenant
and
his
son
for
when
i
asked
where
his
servant
was
from
whom
i
made
myself
sure
of
knowing
every
thing
which
was
proper
to
be
asked
that
a
right
distinction
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
i
was
answered
an
please
your
honour
that
he
had
no
servant
with
him
that
he
had
come
to
the
inn
with
hired
horses
which
upon
finding
himself
unable
to
proceed
to
join
i
suppose
the
regiment
he
had
dismissed
the
morning
after
he
if
i
get
better
my
dear
said
he
as
he
gave
his
purse
to
his
son
to
pay
the
man
we
can
hire
horses
from
but
alas
the
poor
gentleman
will
never
get
from
hence
said
the
landlady
to
me
for
i
heard
the
all
night
long
and
when
he
dies
the
youth
his
son
will
certainly
die
with
him
for
he
is
already
i
was
hearing
this
account
continued
the
corporal
when
the
youth
came
into
the
kitchen
to
order
the
thin
toast
the
landlord
spoke
of
but
i
will
do
it
for
my
father
myself
said
the
pray
let
my
save
you
the
trouble
young
gentleman
said
i
taking
up
a
fork
for
the
purpose
and
offering
him
my
chair
to
sit
down
upon
by
the
fire
whilst
i
did
i
believe
sir
said
he
very
modestly
i
can
please
him
best
i
am
sure
said
i
his
honour
will
not
like
the
toast
the
worse
for
being
toasted
by
an
old
the
youth
took
hold
of
my
hand
and
instantly
burst
into
poor
youth
said
my
uncle
toby
he
has
been
bred
up
from
an
infant
in
the
army
and
the
name
of
a
soldier
trim
sounded
in
his
ears
like
the
name
of
a
friend
i
wish
i
had
him
here
i
never
in
the
longest
march
said
the
corporal
had
so
great
a
mind
to
my
dinner
as
i
had
to
cry
with
him
for
company
what
could
be
the
matter
with
me
an
please
your
honour
nothing
in
the
world
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
blowing
his
nose
but
that
thou
art
a
fellow
when
i
gave
him
the
toast
continued
the
corporal
i
thought
it
was
proper
to
tell
him
i
was
captain
shandy
servant
and
that
your
honour
though
a
stranger
was
extremely
concerned
for
his
father
and
that
if
there
was
any
thing
in
your
house
or
cellar
and
thou
have
added
my
purse
too
said
my
uncle
toby
he
was
heartily
welcome
to
it
he
made
a
very
low
bow
which
was
meant
to
your
honour
but
no
answer
for
his
heart
was
full
so
he
went
up
stairs
with
the
toast
i
warrant
you
my
dear
said
i
as
i
opened
the
your
father
will
be
well
mr
yorick
curate
was
smoking
a
pipe
by
the
kitchen
fire
but
said
not
a
word
good
or
bad
to
comfort
the
i
thought
it
wrong
added
the
corporal
i
think
so
too
said
my
uncle
toby
when
the
lieutenant
had
taken
his
glass
of
sack
and
toast
he
felt
himself
a
little
revived
and
sent
down
into
the
kitchen
to
let
me
know
that
in
about
ten
minutes
he
should
be
glad
if
i
would
step
up
i
believe
said
the
landlord
he
is
going
to
say
his
prayers
for
there
was
a
book
laid
upon
the
chair
by
his
and
as
i
shut
the
door
i
saw
his
son
take
up
a
i
thought
said
the
curate
that
you
gentlemen
of
the
army
mr
trim
never
said
your
prayers
at
i
heard
the
poor
gentleman
say
his
prayers
last
night
said
the
landlady
very
devoutly
and
with
my
own
ears
or
i
could
not
have
believed
are
you
sure
of
it
replied
the
a
soldier
an
please
your
reverence
said
i
prays
as
often
of
his
own
accord
as
a
parson
and
when
he
is
fighting
for
his
king
and
for
his
own
life
and
for
his
honour
too
he
has
the
most
reason
to
pray
to
god
of
any
one
in
the
whole
world
was
well
said
of
thee
trim
said
my
uncle
but
when
a
soldier
said
i
an
please
your
reverence
has
been
standing
for
twelve
hours
together
in
the
trenches
up
to
his
knees
in
cold
water
or
engaged
said
i
for
months
together
in
long
and
dangerous
marches
harassed
perhaps
in
his
rear
harassing
others
detached
here
countermanded
there
resting
this
night
out
upon
his
arms
beat
up
in
his
shirt
the
next
benumbed
in
his
joints
perhaps
without
straw
in
his
tent
to
kneel
on
must
say
his
prayers
how
and
when
he
i
believe
said
i
for
i
was
piqued
quoth
the
corporal
for
the
reputation
of
the
army
i
believe
an
please
your
reverence
said
i
that
when
a
soldier
gets
time
to
pray
he
prays
as
heartily
as
a
parson
though
not
with
all
his
fuss
and
thou
shouldst
not
have
said
that
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
for
god
only
knows
who
is
a
hypocrite
and
who
is
not
at
the
great
and
general
review
of
us
all
corporal
at
the
day
of
judgment
and
not
till
then
it
will
be
seen
who
has
done
their
duties
in
this
world
and
who
has
not
and
we
shall
be
advanced
trim
i
hope
we
shall
said
it
is
in
the
scripture
said
my
uncle
toby
and
i
will
shew
it
thee
in
the
mean
time
we
may
depend
upon
it
trim
for
our
comfort
said
my
uncle
toby
that
god
almighty
is
so
good
and
just
a
governor
of
the
world
that
if
we
have
but
done
our
duties
in
it
it
will
never
be
enquired
into
whether
we
have
done
them
in
a
red
coat
or
a
black
one
i
hope
not
said
the
corporal
but
go
on
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
with
thy
story
when
i
went
up
continued
the
corporal
into
the
lieutenant
room
which
i
did
not
do
till
the
expiration
of
the
ten
minutes
he
was
lying
in
his
bed
with
his
head
raised
upon
his
hand
with
his
elbow
upon
the
pillow
and
a
clean
white
cambrick
handkerchief
beside
it
the
youth
was
just
stooping
down
to
take
up
the
cushion
upon
which
i
supposed
he
had
been
kneeling
the
book
was
laid
upon
the
bed
and
as
he
rose
in
taking
up
the
cushion
with
one
hand
he
reached
out
his
other
to
take
it
away
at
the
same
let
it
remain
there
my
dear
said
the
lieutenant
he
did
not
offer
to
speak
to
me
till
i
had
walked
up
close
to
his
if
you
are
captain
shandy
servant
said
he
you
must
present
my
thanks
to
your
master
with
my
little
boy

with
them
for
his
courtesy
to
me

the
i
told
him

honour
was
then
said
he
i
served
three
campaigns
with
him
in
flanders
and
remember
him
but
is
most
likely
as
i
had
not
the
honour
of
any
acquaintance
with
him
that
he
knows
nothing
of
you
will
tell
him
however
that
the
person

laid
under
obligations
to
him
is
one

a
lieutenant
in
angus
but

said
he
wiping
his
eyes
with
his
handkerchief
then
well
may
in
saying
this
he
drew
a
little
ring
out
of
his
bosom
which
seemed
tied
with
a
black
ribband
about
his
neck
and
kiss
it
twice

billy

he
the
boy
flew
across
the
room
to
the
and
falling
down
upon
his
knee
took
the
ring
in
his
hand
and
kissed
it
too

kissed
his
father

my
uncle
toby

said
my
uncle
toby
sighing
again
the
story
of
the
ensign
and
his
wife
with
a
circumstance
his
modesty
omitted
and
particularly
well
that
he
as
well
as
she
upon
some
account
or
other

forget
what

universally
pitied
by
the
whole
regiment

from
off
the
bed
and
saw
me
to
the

of

as
we
went
down
together
told
me
they
had
come
from
ireland
and

on
their
route
to

the
regiment
in

the
story
of
le
fever
continued
it
was
to
my
uncle
toby
eternal
honour
though
i
tell
it
only
for
the
sake
of
those
who
when
coop
in
betwixt
a
natural
and
a
positive
law
know
not
for
their
souls
which
way
in
the
world
to
turn
themselves
that
notwithstanding
my
uncle
toby
was
warmly
engaged
at
that
time
in
carrying
on
the
siege
of
dendermond
parallel
with
the
allies
who
pressed
theirs
on
so
vigorously
that
they
scarce
allowed
him
time
to
get
his
dinner
that
nevertheless
he
gave
up
dendermond
though
he
had
already
made
a
lodgment
upon
the
counterscarp
and
bent
his
whole
thoughts
towards
the
private
distresses
at
the
inn
and
except
that
he
ordered
the
garden
gate
to
be
bolted
up
by
which
he
might
be
said
to
have
turned
the
siege
of
dendermond
into
a
blockade
he
left
dendermond
to
itself
to
be
relieved
or
not
by
the
french
king
as
the
french
king
thought
good
and
only
considered
how
he
himself
should
relieve
the
poor
lieutenant
and
his
son
that
kind
being
who
is
a
friend
to
the
friendless
shall
recompence
thee
for
this
thou
hast
left
this
matter
short
said
my
uncle
toby
to
the
corporal
as
he
was
putting
him
to
bed
and
i
will
tell
thee
in
what
in
the
first
place
when
thou
madest
an
offer
of
my
services
to
le
fever
as
sickness
and
travelling
are
both
expensive
and
thou
knowest
he
was
but
a
poor
lieutenant
with
a
son
to
subsist
as
well
as
himself
out
of
his
pay
that
thou
didst
not
make
an
offer
to
him
of
my
purse
because
had
he
stood
in
need
thou
knowest
trim
he
had
been
as
welcome
to
it
as
your
honour
knows
said
the
corporal
i
had
no
orders
true
quoth
my
uncle
toby
thou
didst
very
right
trim
as
a
soldier
but
certainly
very
wrong
as
a
man
in
the
second
place
for
which
indeed
thou
hast
the
same
excuse
continued
my
uncle
toby
when
thou
offeredst
him
whatever
was
in
my
house
thou
shouldst
have
offered
him
my
house
too
a
sick
brother
officer
should
have
the
best
quarters
trim
and
if
we
had
him
with
us
we
could
tend
and
look
to
him
thou
art
an
excellent
nurse
thyself
trim
and
what
with
thy
care
of
him
and
the
old
woman
and
his
boy
and
mine
together
we
might
recruit
him
again
at
once
and
set
him
upon
his
in
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
added
my
uncle
toby
smiling
he
might
he
will
never
march
an
please
your
honour
in
this
world
said
the
corporal
he
will
march
said
my
uncle
toby
rising
up
from
the
side
of
the
bed
with
one
shoe
off
an
please
your
honour
said
the
corporal
he
will
never
march
but
to
his
grave
he
shall
march
cried
my
uncle
toby
marching
the
foot
which
had
a
shoe
on
though
without
advanceing
an
inch
he
shall
march
to
his
he
can
not
stand
it
said
the
corporal
he
shall
be
supported
said
my
uncle
toby
he
drop
at
last
said
the
corporal
and
what
will
become
of
his
boy
he
shall
not
drop
said
my
uncle
toby
do
what
we
can
for
him
said
trim
maintaining
his
point
the
poor
soul
will
die
he
shall
not
die
by
cried
my
uncle
toby
the
accusing
spirit
which
flew
up
to
heaven
chancery
with
the
oath
blush
as
he
gave
it
in
and
the
recording
angel
as
he
wrote
it
down
dropp
a
tear
upon
the
word
and
blotted
it
out
for
ever
chapter
my
uncle
toby
went
to
his
bureau
put
his
purse
into
his
breeches
pocket
and
having
ordered
the
corporal
to
go
early
in
the
morning
for
a
physician
he
went
to
bed
and
fell
asleep
chapter
the
story
of
le
fever
continued
the
sun
looked
bright
the
morning
after
to
every
eye
in
the
village
but
le
fever
and
his
afflicted
son
the
hand
of
death
pressed
heavy
upon
his
and
hardly
could
the
wheel
at
the
cistern
turn
round
its
circle
when
my
uncle
toby
who
had
rose
up
an
hour
before
his
wonted
time
entered
the
lieutenant
room
and
without
preface
or
apology
sat
himself
down
upon
the
chair
by
the
and
independently
of
all
modes
and
customs
opened
the
curtain
in
the
manner
an
old
friend
and
brother
officer
would
have
done
it
and
asked
him
how
he
did
how
he
had
rested
in
the
night
what
was
his
complaint
where
was
his
pain
and
what
he
could
do
to
help
him
and
without
giving
him
time
to
answer
any
one
of
the
enquiries
went
on
and
told
him
of
the
little
plan
which
he
had
been
concerting
with
the
corporal
the
night
before
for
you
shall
go
home
directly
le
fever
said
my
uncle
toby
to
my
house
and
we
send
for
a
doctor
to
see
what
the
matter
and
have
an
apothecary
and
the
corporal
shall
be
your
nurse
and
i
be
your
servant
le
fever
there
was
a
frankness
in
my
uncle
toby
not
the
effect
of
familiarity
but
the
cause
of
it
which
let
you
at
once
into
his
soul
and
shewed
you
the
goodness
of
his
nature
to
this
there
was
something
in
his
looks
and
voice
and
manner
superadded
which
eternally
beckoned
to
the
unfortunate
to
come
and
take
shelter
under
him
so
that
before
my
uncle
toby
had
half
finished
the
kind
offers
he
was
making
to
the
father
had
the
son
insensibly
pressed
up
close
to
his
knees
and
had
taken
hold
of
the
breast
of
his
coat
and
was
pulling
it
towards
the
blood
and
spirits
of
le
fever
which
were
waxing
cold
and
slow
within
him
and
were
retreating
to
their
last
citadel
the
heart
rallied
back
the
film
forsook
his
eyes
for
a
moment
he
looked
up
wishfully
in
my
uncle
toby
face
then
cast
a
look
upon
his
boy
and
that
ligament
fine
as
it
was
was
never
nature
instantly
ebb
again
the
film
returned
to
its
place
the
pulse
fluttered
stopp
went
on
throbb
again
moved
stopp
shall
i
go
on
no
chapter
i
am
so
impatient
to
return
to
my
own
story
that
what
remains
of
young
le
fever
that
is
from
this
turn
of
his
fortune
to
the
time
my
uncle
toby
recommended
him
for
my
preceptor
shall
be
told
in
a
very
few
words
in
the
next
all
that
is
necessary
to
be
added
to
this
chapter
is
as
that
my
uncle
toby
with
young
le
fever
in
his
hand
attended
the
poor
lieutenant
as
chief
mourners
to
his
grave
that
the
governor
of
dendermond
paid
his
obsequies
all
military
honours
and
that
yorick
not
to
be
paid
him
all
ecclesiastic
for
he
buried
him
in
his
chancel
and
it
appears
likewise
he
preached
a
funeral
sermon
over
him
i
say
it
appears
for
it
was
yorick
custom
which
i
suppose
a
general
one
with
those
of
his
profession
on
the
first
leaf
of
every
sermon
which
he
composed
to
chronicle
down
the
time
the
place
and
the
occasion
of
its
being
preached
to
this
he
was
ever
wont
to
add
some
short
comment
or
stricture
upon
the
sermon
itself
seldom
indeed
much
to
its
credit
for
instance
this
sermon
upon
the
jewish
dispensation
i
do
like
it
at
all
though
i
own
there
is
a
world
of
knowledge
in
it
but
is
all
tritical
and
most
tritically
put
this
is
but
a
flimsy
kind
of
a
composition
what
was
in
my
head
when
i
made
it
the
excellency
of
this
text
is
that
it
will
suit
any
sermon
and
of
this
sermon
that
it
will
suit
any
for
this
sermon
i
shall
be
hanged
for
i
have
stolen
the
greatest
part
of
it
doctor
paidagunes
found
me
out
set
a
thief
to
catch
a
on
the
back
of
half
a
dozen
i
find
written
so
so
and
no
more
and
upon
a
couple
moderato
by
which
as
far
as
one
may
gather
from
altieri
italian
dictionary
but
mostly
from
the
authority
of
a
piece
of
green
whipcord
which
seemed
to
have
been
the
unravelling
of
with
which
he
has
left
us
the
two
sermons
marked
moderato
and
the
half
dozen
of
so
so
tied
fast
together
in
one
bundle
by
themselves
one
may
safely
suppose
he
meant
pretty
near
the
same
thing
there
is
but
one
difficulty
in
the
way
of
this
conjecture
which
is
this
that
the
moderato
are
five
times
better
than
the
so
so
show
ten
times
more
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
have
seventy
times
more
wit
and
spirit
in
them
and
to
rise
properly
in
my
climax
discovered
a
thousand
times
more
genius
and
to
crown
all
are
infinitely
more
entertaining
than
those
tied
up
with
them
for
which
reason
yorick
dramatic
sermons
are
offered
to
the
world
though
i
shall
admit
but
one
out
of
the
whole
number
of
the
so
so
i
shall
nevertheless
adventure
to
print
the
two
moderato
without
any
sort
of
scruple
what
yorick
could
mean
by
the
words
lentamente
tenute
grave
and
sometimes
adagio
as
applied
to
theological
compositions
and
with
which
he
has
characterised
some
of
these
sermons
i
dare
not
venture
to
i
am
more
puzzled
still
upon
finding
a
alta
upon
one
con
strepito
upon
the
back
of
another
scicilliana
upon
a
third
alla
capella
upon
a
fourth
con
upon
this
senza
upon
all
i
know
is
that
they
are
musical
terms
and
have
a
meaning
and
as
he
was
a
musical
man
i
will
make
no
doubt
but
that
by
some
quaint
application
of
such
metaphors
to
the
compositions
in
hand
they
impressed
very
distinct
ideas
of
their
several
characters
upon
his
fancy
whatever
they
may
do
upon
that
of
others
amongst
these
there
is
that
particular
sermon
which
has
unaccountably
led
me
into
this
digression
the
funeral
sermon
upon
poor
le
fever
wrote
out
very
fairly
as
if
from
a
hasty
i
take
notice
of
it
the
more
because
it
seems
to
have
been
his
favourite
composition
it
is
upon
mortality
and
is
tied
and
with
a
yarn
thrum
and
then
rolled
up
and
twisted
round
with
a
of
dirty
blue
paper
which
seems
to
have
been
once
the
cast
cover
of
a
general
review
which
to
this
day
smells
horribly
of
horse
whether
these
marks
of
humiliation
were
designed
i
something
doubt
because
at
the
end
of
the
sermon
and
not
at
the
beginning
of
it
very
different
from
his
way
of
treating
the
rest
he
had
wrote
bravo
though
not
very
offensively
for
it
is
at
two
inches
at
least
and
a
half
distance
from
and
below
the
concluding
line
of
the
sermon
at
the
very
extremity
of
the
page
and
in
that
right
hand
corner
of
it
which
you
know
is
generally
covered
with
your
thumb
and
to
do
it
justice
it
is
wrote
besides
with
a
crow
quill
so
faintly
in
a
small
italian
hand
as
scarce
to
solicit
the
eye
towards
the
place
whether
your
thumb
is
there
or
not
so
that
from
the
manner
of
it
it
stands
half
excused
and
being
wrote
moreover
with
very
pale
ink
diluted
almost
to
nothing
is
more
like
a
ritratto
of
the
shadow
of
vanity
than
of
vanity
herself
of
the
two
resembling
rather
a
faint
thought
of
transient
applause
secretly
stirring
up
in
the
heart
of
the
composer
than
a
gross
mark
of
it
coarsely
obtruded
upon
the
world
with
all
these
extenuations
i
am
aware
that
in
publishing
this
i
do
no
service
to
yorick
character
as
a
modest
man
but
all
men
have
their
failings
and
what
lessens
this
still
farther
and
almost
wipes
it
away
is
this
that
the
word
was
struck
through
sometime
afterwards
as
appears
from
a
different
tint
of
the
ink
with
a
line
quite
across
it
in
this
manner
bravo
crossed
out
as
if
he
had
retracted
or
was
ashamed
of
the
opinion
he
had
once
entertained
of
it
these
short
characters
of
his
sermons
were
always
written
excepting
in
this
one
instance
upon
the
first
leaf
of
his
sermon
which
served
as
a
cover
to
it
and
usually
upon
the
inside
of
it
which
was
turned
towards
the
text
but
at
the
end
of
his
discourse
where
perhaps
he
had
five
or
six
pages
and
sometimes
perhaps
a
whole
score
to
turn
himself
in
he
took
a
large
circuit
and
indeed
a
much
more
mettlesome
one
as
if
he
had
snatched
the
occasion
of
unlacing
himself
with
a
few
more
frolicksome
strokes
at
vice
than
the
straitness
of
the
pulpit
these
though
they
skirmish
lightly
and
out
of
all
order
are
still
auxiliaries
on
the
side
of
virtue
tell
me
then
mynheer
vander
blonederdondergewdenstronke
why
they
should
not
be
printed
together
chapter
when
my
uncle
toby
had
turned
every
thing
into
money
and
settled
all
accounts
betwixt
the
agent
of
the
regiment
and
le
fever
and
betwixt
le
fever
and
all
mankind
there
remained
nothing
more
in
my
uncle
hands
than
an
old
regimental
coat
and
a
sword
so
that
my
uncle
toby
found
little
or
no
opposition
from
the
world
in
taking
administration
the
coat
my
uncle
toby
gave
the
corporal
wear
it
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
as
long
as
it
will
hold
together
for
the
sake
of
the
poor
lieutenant
and
this
said
my
uncle
toby
taking
up
the
sword
in
his
hand
and
drawing
it
out
of
the
scabbard
as
he
spoke
and
this
le
fever
i
save
for
thee
is
all
the
fortune
continued
my
uncle
toby
hanging
it
up
upon
a
crook
and
pointing
to
it
is
all
the
fortune
my
dear
le
fever
which
god
has
left
thee
but
if
he
has
given
thee
a
heart
to
fight
thy
way
with
it
in
the
world
and
thou
doest
it
like
a
man
of
honour
is
enough
for
us
as
soon
as
my
uncle
toby
had
laid
a
foundation
and
taught
him
to
inscribe
a
regular
polygon
in
a
circle
he
sent
him
to
a
public
school
where
excepting
whitsontide
and
christmas
at
which
times
the
corporal
was
punctually
dispatched
for
him
he
remained
to
the
spring
of
the
year
seventeen
when
the
stories
of
the
emperor
sending
his
army
into
hungary
against
the
turks
kindling
a
spark
of
fire
in
his
bosom
he
left
his
greek
and
latin
without
leave
and
throwing
himself
upon
his
knees
before
my
uncle
toby
begged
his
father
sword
and
my
uncle
toby
leave
along
with
it
to
go
and
try
his
fortune
under
twice
did
my
uncle
toby
forget
his
wound
and
cry
out
le
fever
i
will
go
with
thee
and
thou
shalt
fight
beside
me
and
twice
he
laid
his
hand
upon
his
groin
and
hung
down
his
head
in
sorrow
and
my
uncle
toby
took
down
the
sword
from
the
crook
where
it
had
hung
untouched
ever
since
the
lieutenant
death
and
delivered
it
to
the
corporal
to
brighten
up
and
having
detained
le
fever
a
single
fortnight
to
equip
him
and
contract
for
his
passage
to
leghorn
he
put
the
sword
into
his
if
thou
art
brave
le
fever
said
my
uncle
toby
this
will
not
fail
thee
but
fortune
said
he
musing
a
little
fortune
may
and
if
she
does
added
my
uncle
toby
embracing
him
come
back
again
to
me
le
fever
and
we
will
shape
thee
another
course
the
greatest
injury
could
not
have
oppressed
the
heart
of
le
fever
more
than
my
uncle
toby
paternal
kindness
he
parted
from
my
uncle
toby
as
the
best
of
sons
from
the
best
of
fathers
both
dropped
tears
and
as
my
uncle
toby
gave
him
his
last
kiss
he
slipped
sixty
guineas
tied
up
in
an
old
purse
of
his
father
in
which
was
his
mother
ring
into
his
hand
and
bid
god
bless
him
chapter
le
fever
got
up
to
the
imperial
army
just
time
enough
to
try
what
metal
his
sword
was
made
of
at
the
defeat
of
the
turks
before
belgrade
but
a
series
of
unmerited
mischances
had
pursued
him
from
that
moment
and
trod
close
upon
his
heels
for
four
years
together
after
he
had
withstood
these
buffetings
to
the
last
till
sickness
overtook
him
at
marseilles
from
whence
he
wrote
my
uncle
toby
word
he
had
lost
his
time
his
services
his
health
and
in
short
every
thing
but
his
sword
and
was
waiting
for
the
first
ship
to
return
back
to
him
as
this
letter
came
to
hand
about
six
weeks
before
susannah
accident
le
fever
was
hourly
expected
and
was
uppermost
in
my
uncle
toby
mind
all
the
time
my
father
was
giving
him
and
yorick
a
description
of
what
kind
of
a
person
he
would
chuse
for
a
preceptor
to
me
but
as
my
uncle
toby
thought
my
father
at
first
somewhat
fanciful
in
the
accomplishments
he
required
he
forbore
mentioning
le
fever
name
till
the
character
by
yorick
ending
unexpectedly
in
one
who
should
be
and
generous
and
good
it
impressed
the
image
of
le
fever
and
his
interest
upon
my
uncle
toby
so
forcibly
he
rose
instantly
off
his
chair
and
laying
down
his
pipe
in
order
to
take
hold
of
both
my
father
hands
i
beg
brother
shandy
said
my
uncle
toby
i
may
recommend
poor
le
fever
son
to
you
i
beseech
you
do
added
yorick
he
has
a
good
heart
said
my
uncle
toby
and
a
brave
one
too
an
please
your
honour
said
the
corporal
the
best
hearts
trim
are
ever
the
bravest
replied
my
uncle
and
the
greatest
cowards
an
please
your
honour
in
our
regiment
were
the
greatest
rascals
in
there
was
serjeant
kumber
and
ensign
we
talk
of
them
said
my
father
another
time
chapter
what
a
jovial
and
a
merry
world
would
this
be
may
it
please
your
worships
but
for
that
inextricable
labyrinth
of
debts
cares
woes
want
grief
discontent
melancholy
large
jointures
impositions
and
lies
doctor
slop
like
a
son
of
a
w
as
my
father
called
him
for
it
to
exalt
himself
debased
me
to
death
and
made
ten
thousand
times
more
of
susannah
accident
than
there
was
any
grounds
for
so
that
in
a
week
time
or
less
it
was
in
every
body
mouth
that
poor
master
shandy
and
fame
who
loves
to
double
every
thing
in
three
days
more
had
sworn
positively
she
saw
it
and
all
the
world
as
usual
gave
credit
to
her
evidence
the
nursery
window
had
not
only
but
also
could
the
world
have
been
sued
like
a
my
father
had
brought
an
action
upon
the
case
and
trounced
it
sufficiently
but
to
fall
foul
of
individuals
about
it
as
every
soul
who
had
mentioned
the
affair
did
it
with
the
greatest
pity
imaginable
was
like
flying
in
the
very
face
of
his
best
friends
and
yet
to
acquiesce
under
the
report
in
silence
was
to
acknowledge
it
openly
at
least
in
the
opinion
of
one
half
of
the
world
and
to
make
a
bustle
again
in
contradicting
it
was
to
confirm
it
as
strongly
in
the
opinion
of
the
other
was
ever
poor
devil
of
a
country
gentleman
so
hampered
said
my
father
i
would
shew
him
publickly
said
my
uncle
toby
at
the
market
cross
have
no
effect
said
my
father
chapter
i
put
him
however
into
breeches
said
my
father
let
the
world
say
what
it
will
chapter
there
are
a
thousand
resolutions
sir
both
in
church
and
state
as
well
as
in
matters
madam
of
a
more
private
concern
which
though
they
have
carried
all
the
appearance
in
the
world
of
being
taken
and
entered
upon
in
a
hasty
and
unadvised
manner
were
notwithstanding
this
and
could
you
or
i
have
got
into
the
cabinet
or
stood
behind
the
curtain
we
should
have
found
it
was
so
weighed
poized
and
perpended
argued
upon
canvassed
through
entered
into
and
examined
on
all
sides
with
so
much
coolness
that
the
goddess
of
coolness
herself
i
do
not
take
upon
me
to
prove
her
existence
could
neither
have
wished
it
or
done
it
better
of
the
number
of
these
was
my
father
resolution
of
putting
me
into
breeches
which
though
determined
at
once
in
a
kind
of
huff
and
a
defiance
of
all
mankind
had
nevertheless
been
pro
and
conn
and
judicially
talked
over
betwixt
him
and
my
mother
about
a
month
before
in
two
several
beds
of
justice
which
my
father
had
held
for
that
purpose
i
shall
explain
the
nature
of
these
beds
of
justice
in
my
next
chapter
and
in
the
chapter
following
that
you
shall
step
with
me
madam
behind
the
curtain
only
to
hear
in
what
kind
of
manner
my
father
and
my
mother
debated
between
themselves
this
affair
of
the
breeches
from
which
you
may
form
an
idea
how
they
debated
all
lesser
matters
chapter
the
ancient
goths
of
germany
who
the
learned
cluverius
is
positive
were
first
seated
in
the
country
between
the
vistula
and
the
oder
and
who
afterwards
incorporated
the
herculi
the
bugians
and
some
other
vandallick
clans
to
had
all
of
them
a
wise
custom
of
debating
every
thing
of
importance
to
their
state
twice
that
is
once
drunk
and
once
sober
drunk
that
their
councils
might
not
want
vigour
and
sober
that
they
might
not
want
discretion
now
my
father
being
entirely
a
was
a
long
time
gravelled
almost
to
death
in
turning
this
as
much
to
his
advantage
as
he
did
every
other
thing
which
the
ancients
did
or
said
and
it
was
not
till
the
seventh
year
of
his
marriage
after
a
thousand
fruitless
experiments
and
devices
that
he
hit
upon
an
expedient
which
answered
the
purpose
and
that
was
when
any
difficult
and
momentous
point
was
to
be
settled
in
the
family
which
required
great
sobriety
and
great
spirit
too
in
its
determination
he
fixed
and
set
apart
the
first
sunday
night
in
the
month
and
the
saturday
night
which
immediately
preceded
it
to
argue
it
over
in
bed
with
my
mother
by
which
contrivance
if
you
consider
sir
with
yourself
these
my
father
humorously
enough
called
his
beds
of
justice
for
from
the
two
different
counsels
taken
in
these
two
different
humours
a
middle
one
was
generally
found
out
which
touched
the
point
of
wisdom
as
well
as
if
he
had
got
drunk
and
sober
a
hundred
times
i
must
not
be
made
a
secret
of
to
the
world
that
this
answers
full
as
well
in
literary
discussions
as
either
in
military
or
conjugal
but
it
is
not
every
author
that
can
try
the
experiment
as
the
goths
and
vandals
did
it
or
if
he
can
may
it
be
always
for
his
body
health
and
to
do
it
as
my
father
did
it
am
i
sure
it
would
be
always
for
his
soul
my
way
is
this
in
all
nice
and
ticklish
discussions
of
which
heaven
knows
there
are
but
too
many
in
my
book
where
i
find
i
can
not
take
a
step
without
the
danger
of
having
either
their
worships
or
their
reverences
upon
my
back
i
write
full
and
fasting
or
write
it
all
full
and
correct
it
fasting
or
write
it
fasting
and
correct
it
full
for
they
all
come
to
the
same
thing
so
that
with
a
less
variation
from
my
father
plan
than
my
father
from
the
gothick
i
feel
myself
upon
a
par
with
him
in
his
first
bed
of
justice
and
no
way
inferior
to
him
in
his
these
different
and
almost
irreconcileable
effects
flow
uniformly
from
the
wise
and
wonderful
mechanism
of
nature
of
which
be
her
the
all
that
we
can
do
is
to
turn
and
work
the
machine
to
the
improvement
and
better
manufactory
of
the
arts
and
now
when
i
write
full
i
write
as
if
i
was
never
to
write
fasting
again
as
long
as
i
live
that
is
i
write
free
from
the
cares
as
well
as
the
terrors
of
the
i
count
not
the
number
of
my
scars
nor
does
my
fancy
go
forth
into
dark
entries
and
to
my
in
a
word
my
pen
takes
its
course
and
i
write
on
as
much
from
the
fulness
of
my
heart
as
my
but
when
an
please
your
honours
i
indite
fasting
is
a
different
i
pay
the
world
all
possible
attention
and
respect
and
have
as
great
a
share
whilst
it
lasts
of
that
under
strapping
virtue
of
discretion
as
the
best
of
so
that
betwixt
both
i
write
a
careless
kind
of
a
civil
nonsensical
shandean
book
which
will
do
all
your
hearts
good
and
all
your
heads
too
provided
you
understand
it
chapter
we
should
begin
said
my
father
turning
himself
half
round
in
bed
and
shifting
his
pillow
a
little
towards
my
mother
as
he
opened
the
debate
we
should
begin
to
think
shandy
of
putting
this
boy
into
we
should
so
said
my
we
defer
it
my
dear
quoth
my
father
i
think
we
do
shandy
said
my
mother
not
but
the
child
looks
extremely
well
said
my
father
in
his
vests
and
he
does
look
very
well
in
them
replied
my
and
for
that
reason
it
would
be
almost
a
sin
added
my
father
to
take
him
out
of
it
would
so
said
my
mother
but
indeed
he
is
growing
a
very
tall
lad
rejoined
my
father
he
is
very
tall
for
his
age
indeed
said
my
i
can
not
making
two
syllables
of
it
imagine
quoth
my
father
who
the
deuce
he
takes
i
can
not
conceive
for
my
life
said
my
humph
said
my
father
the
dialogue
ceased
for
a
moment
i
am
very
short
myself
continued
my
father
gravely
you
are
very
short
shandy
said
my
mother
humph
quoth
my
father
to
himself
a
second
time
in
muttering
which
he
plucked
his
pillow
a
little
further
from
my
mother
and
turning
about
again
there
was
an
end
of
the
debate
for
three
minutes
and
a
half
when
he
gets
these
breeches
made
cried
my
father
in
a
higher
tone
he
look
like
a
beast
in
he
will
be
very
awkward
in
them
at
first
replied
my
mother
and
be
lucky
if
that
the
worst
o
added
my
father
it
will
be
very
lucky
answered
my
mother
i
suppose
replied
my
father
making
some
pause
first
he
be
exactly
like
other
people
exactly
said
my
though
i
shall
be
sorry
for
that
added
my
father
and
so
the
debate
stopp
they
should
be
of
leather
said
my
father
turning
him
about
they
will
last
him
said
my
mother
the
longest
but
he
can
have
no
linings
to
replied
my
he
can
not
said
my
mother
better
to
have
them
of
fustian
quoth
my
father
nothing
can
be
better
quoth
my
except
dimity
replied
my
father
is
best
of
all
replied
my
mother
one
must
not
give
him
his
death
however
interrupted
my
father
by
no
means
said
my
mother
and
so
the
dialogue
stood
still
again
i
am
resolved
however
quoth
my
father
breaking
silence
the
fourth
time
he
shall
have
no
pockets
in
there
is
no
occasion
for
any
said
my
i
mean
in
his
coat
and
waistcoat
cried
my
father
i
mean
so
too
replied
my
mother
though
if
he
gets
a
gig
or
top
poor
souls
it
is
a
crown
and
a
sceptre
to
them
they
should
have
where
to
secure
order
it
as
you
please
shandy
replied
my
but
do
you
think
it
right
added
my
father
pressing
the
point
home
to
her
perfectly
said
my
mother
if
it
pleases
you
mr
there
for
you
cried
my
father
losing
his
temper
pleases
me
you
never
will
distinguish
shandy
nor
shall
i
ever
teach
you
to
do
it
betwixt
a
point
of
pleasure
and
a
point
of
this
was
on
the
sunday
night
and
further
this
chapter
sayeth
not
chapter
after
my
father
had
debated
the
affair
of
the
breeches
with
my
mother
he
consulted
albertus
rubenius
upon
it
and
albertus
rubenius
used
my
father
ten
times
worse
in
the
consultation
if
possible
than
even
my
father
had
used
my
mother
for
as
rubenius
had
wrote
a
quarto
express
de
re
vestiaria
veterum
it
was
rubenius
business
to
have
given
my
father
some
on
the
contrary
my
father
might
as
well
have
thought
of
extracting
the
seven
cardinal
virtues
out
of
a
long
beard
as
of
extracting
a
single
word
out
of
rubenius
upon
the
subject
upon
every
other
article
of
ancient
dress
rubenius
was
very
communicative
to
my
father
gave
him
a
full
satisfactory
account
of
the
toga
or
loose
gown
the
chlamys
the
ephod
the
tunica
or
jacket
the
synthesis
the
paenula
the
lacema
with
its
cucullus
the
paludamentum
the
praetexta
the
sagum
or
soldier
jerkin
the
trabea
of
which
according
to
suetonius
there
was
three
but
what
are
all
these
to
the
breeches
said
my
father
rubenius
threw
him
down
upon
the
counter
all
kinds
of
shoes
which
had
been
in
fashion
with
the
there
was
the
open
shoe
the
close
shoe
the
slip
shoe
the
wooden
shoe
the
soc
the
buskin
and
the
military
shoe
with
hobnails
in
it
which
juvenal
takes
notice
of
there
were
the
clogs
the
pattins
the
pantoufles
the
brogues
the
sandals
with
latchets
to
them
there
was
the
felt
shoe
the
linen
shoe
the
laced
shoe
the
braided
shoe
the
calceus
incisus
and
the
calceus
rostratus
rubenius
shewed
my
father
how
well
they
all
fitted
in
what
manner
they
laced
on
with
what
points
straps
thongs
latchets
ribbands
jaggs
and
but
i
want
to
be
informed
about
the
breeches
said
my
father
albertus
rubenius
informed
my
father
that
the
romans
manufactured
stuffs
of
various
fabrics
some
plain
some
striped
others
diapered
throughout
the
whole
contexture
of
the
wool
with
silk
and
gold
that
linen
did
not
begin
to
be
in
common
use
till
towards
the
declension
of
the
empire
when
the
egyptians
coming
to
settle
amongst
them
brought
it
into
vogue
that
persons
of
quality
and
fortune
distinguished
themselves
by
the
fineness
and
whiteness
of
their
clothes
which
colour
next
to
purple
which
was
appropriated
to
the
great
offices
they
most
affected
and
wore
on
their
and
public
that
it
appeared
from
the
best
historians
of
those
times
that
they
frequently
sent
their
clothes
to
the
fuller
to
be
clean
and
whitened
but
that
the
inferior
people
to
avoid
that
expence
generally
wore
brown
clothes
and
of
a
something
coarser
texture
till
towards
the
beginning
of
augustus
reign
when
the
slave
dressed
like
his
master
and
almost
every
distinction
of
habiliment
was
lost
but
the
latus
clavus
and
what
was
the
latus
clavus
said
my
father
rubenius
told
him
that
the
point
was
still
litigating
amongst
the
learned
that
egnatius
sigonius
bossius
ticinensis
bayfius
budaeus
salmasius
lipsius
lazius
isaac
casaubon
and
joseph
scaliger
all
differed
from
each
other
and
he
from
them
that
some
took
it
to
be
the
button
some
the
coat
itself
others
only
the
colour
of
it
that
the
great
bayfuis
in
his
wardrobe
of
the
ancients
chap
honestly
said
he
knew
not
what
it
was
whether
a
tibula
a
stud
a
button
a
loop
a
buckle
or
clasps
and
my
father
lost
the
horse
but
not
the
saddle
they
are
hooks
and
eyes
said
my
father
and
with
hooks
and
eyes
he
ordered
my
breeches
to
be
made
chapter
we
are
now
going
to
enter
upon
a
new
scene
of
leave
we
then
the
breeches
in
the
taylor
hands
with
my
father
standing
over
him
with
his
cane
reading
him
as
he
sat
at
work
a
lecture
upon
the
latus
clavus
and
pointing
to
the
precise
part
of
the
waistband
where
he
was
determined
to
have
it
sewed
leave
we
my
mother
truest
of
all
the
of
her
sex
careless
about
it
as
about
every
thing
else
in
the
world
which
concerned
her
that
is
indifferent
whether
it
was
done
this
way
or
that
provided
it
was
but
done
at
leave
we
slop
likewise
to
the
full
profits
of
all
my
leave
we
poor
le
fever
to
recover
and
get
home
from
marseilles
as
he
and
last
of
all
because
the
hardest
of
all
let
us
leave
if
possible
myself
but
is
impossible
i
must
go
along
with
you
to
the
end
of
the
work
chapter
if
the
reader
has
not
a
clear
conception
of
the
rood
and
the
half
of
ground
which
lay
at
the
bottom
of
my
uncle
toby
and
which
was
the
scene
of
so
many
of
his
delicious
hours
the
fault
is
not
in
me
but
in
his
imagination
for
i
am
sure
i
gave
him
so
minute
a
description
i
was
almost
ashamed
of
it
when
fate
was
looking
forwards
one
afternoon
into
the
great
transactions
of
future
times
and
recollected
for
what
purposes
this
little
plot
by
a
decree
fast
bound
down
in
iron
had
been
destined
she
gave
a
nod
to
nature
was
enough
nature
threw
half
a
spade
full
of
her
kindliest
compost
upon
it
with
just
so
much
clay
in
it
as
to
retain
the
forms
of
angles
and
indentings
and
so
little
of
it
too
as
not
to
cling
to
the
spade
and
render
works
of
so
much
glory
nasty
in
foul
weather
my
uncle
toby
came
down
as
the
reader
has
been
informed
with
plans
along
with
him
of
almost
every
fortified
town
in
italy
and
flanders
so
let
the
duke
of
marlborough
or
the
allies
have
set
down
before
what
town
they
pleased
my
uncle
toby
was
prepared
for
them
his
way
which
was
the
simplest
one
in
the
world
was
this
as
soon
as
ever
a
town
was
invested
but
sooner
when
the
design
was
known
to
take
the
plan
of
it
let
it
be
what
town
it
would
and
enlarge
it
upon
a
scale
to
the
exact
size
of
his
upon
the
surface
of
which
by
means
of
a
large
role
of
packthread
and
a
number
of
small
piquets
driven
into
the
ground
at
the
several
angles
and
redans
he
transferred
the
lines
from
his
paper
then
taking
the
profile
of
the
place
with
its
works
to
determine
the
depths
and
slopes
of
the
ditches
the
talus
of
the
glacis
and
the
precise
height
of
the
several
banquets
parapets
he
set
the
corporal
to
work
and
sweetly
went
it
on
the
nature
of
the
soil
the
nature
of
the
work
itself
and
above
all
the
of
my
uncle
toby
sitting
by
from
morning
to
night
and
chatting
kindly
with
the
corporal
upon
deeds
left
labour
little
else
but
the
ceremony
of
the
name
when
the
place
was
finished
in
this
manner
and
put
into
a
proper
posture
of
defence
it
was
invested
and
my
uncle
toby
and
the
corporal
began
to
run
their
first
i
beg
i
may
not
be
interrupted
in
my
story
by
being
told
that
the
first
parallel
should
be
at
least
three
hundred
toises
distant
from
the
main
body
of
the
place
and
that
i
have
not
left
a
single
inch
for
it
for
my
uncle
toby
took
the
liberty
of
incroaching
upon
his
for
the
sake
of
enlarging
his
works
on
the
and
for
that
reason
generally
ran
his
first
and
second
parallels
betwixt
two
rows
of
his
cabbages
and
his
cauliflowers
the
conveniences
and
inconveniences
of
which
will
be
considered
at
large
in
the
history
of
my
uncle
and
the
corporal
campaigns
of
which
this
i
now
writing
is
but
a
sketch
and
will
be
finished
if
i
conjecture
right
in
three
pages
but
there
is
no
guessing
the
campaigns
themselves
will
take
up
as
many
books
and
therefore
i
apprehend
it
would
be
hanging
too
great
a
weight
of
one
kind
of
matter
in
so
flimsy
a
performance
as
this
to
rhapsodize
them
as
i
once
intended
into
the
body
of
the
work
surely
they
had
better
be
printed
apart
we
consider
the
affair
so
take
the
following
sketch
of
them
in
the
mean
time
chapter
when
the
town
with
its
works
was
finished
my
uncle
toby
and
the
corporal
began
to
run
their
first
parallel
not
at
random
or
any
how
but
from
the
same
points
and
distances
the
allies
had
begun
to
run
theirs
and
regulating
their
approaches
and
attacks
by
the
accounts
my
uncle
toby
received
from
the
daily
papers
they
went
on
during
the
whole
siege
step
by
step
with
the
allies
when
the
duke
of
marlborough
made
a
lodgment
my
uncle
toby
made
a
lodgment
and
when
the
face
of
a
bastion
was
battered
down
or
a
defence
ruined
the
corporal
took
his
mattock
and
did
as
much
and
so
on
gaining
ground
and
making
themselves
masters
of
the
works
one
after
another
till
the
town
fell
into
their
hands
to
one
who
took
pleasure
in
the
happy
state
of
others
there
could
not
have
been
a
greater
sight
in
world
than
on
a
post
morning
in
which
a
practicable
breach
had
been
made
by
the
duke
of
marlborough
in
the
main
body
of
the
place
to
have
stood
behind
the
hedge
and
observed
the
spirit
with
which
my
uncle
toby
with
trim
behind
him
sallied
forth
the
one
with
the
gazette
in
his
hand
the
other
with
a
spade
on
his
shoulder
to
execute
the
what
an
honest
triumph
in
my
uncle
toby
looks
as
he
marched
up
to
the
ramparts
what
intense
pleasure
swimming
in
his
eye
as
he
stood
over
the
corporal
reading
the
paragraph
ten
times
over
to
him
as
he
was
at
work
lest
peradventure
he
should
make
the
breach
an
inch
too
wide
or
leave
it
an
inch
too
but
when
the
chamade
was
beat
and
the
corporal
helped
my
uncle
up
it
and
followed
with
the
colours
in
his
hand
to
fix
them
upon
the
ramparts
heaven
earth
sea
but
what
avails
apostrophes
with
all
your
elements
wet
or
dry
ye
never
compounded
so
intoxicating
a
draught
in
this
track
of
happiness
for
many
years
without
one
interruption
to
it
except
now
and
then
when
the
wind
continued
to
blow
due
west
for
a
week
or
ten
days
together
which
detained
the
flanders
mail
and
kept
them
so
long
in
torture
but
still
was
the
torture
of
the
happy
in
this
track
i
say
did
my
uncle
toby
and
trim
move
for
many
years
every
year
of
which
and
sometimes
every
month
from
the
invention
of
either
the
one
or
the
other
of
them
adding
some
new
conceit
or
quirk
of
improvement
to
their
operations
which
always
opened
fresh
springs
of
delight
in
carrying
them
on
the
first
year
campaign
was
carried
on
from
beginning
to
end
in
the
plain
and
simple
method
i
related
in
the
second
year
in
which
my
uncle
toby
took
liege
and
ruremond
he
thought
he
might
afford
the
expence
of
four
handsome
of
two
of
which
i
have
given
an
exact
description
in
the
former
part
of
my
work
at
the
latter
end
of
the
same
year
he
added
a
couple
of
gates
with
these
last
were
converted
afterwards
into
orgues
as
the
better
thing
and
during
the
winter
of
the
same
year
my
uncle
toby
instead
of
a
new
suit
of
clothes
which
he
always
had
at
christmas
treated
himself
with
a
handsome
to
stand
at
the
corner
of
the
betwixt
which
point
and
the
foot
of
the
glacis
there
was
left
a
little
kind
of
an
esplanade
for
him
and
the
corporal
to
confer
and
hold
councils
of
war
upon
the
was
in
case
of
rain
all
these
were
painted
white
three
times
over
the
ensuing
spring
which
enabled
my
uncle
toby
to
take
the
field
with
great
splendour
my
father
would
often
say
to
yorick
that
if
any
mortal
in
the
whole
universe
had
done
such
a
thing
except
his
brother
toby
it
would
have
been
looked
upon
by
the
world
as
one
of
the
most
refined
satires
upon
the
parade
and
prancing
manner
in
which
lewis
xiv
from
the
beginning
of
the
war
but
particularly
that
very
year
had
taken
the
field
but
is
not
my
brother
toby
nature
kind
soul
my
father
would
add
to
insult
any
one
but
let
us
go
on
chapter
i
must
observe
that
although
in
the
first
year
campaign
the
word
town
is
often
mentioned
yet
there
was
no
town
at
that
time
within
the
polygon
that
addition
was
not
made
till
the
summer
following
the
spring
in
which
the
bridges
and
were
painted
which
was
the
third
year
of
my
uncle
toby
campaigns
when
upon
his
taking
amberg
bonn
and
rhinberg
and
huy
and
limbourg
one
after
another
a
thought
came
into
the
corporal
head
that
to
talk
of
taking
so
many
towns
without
one
town
to
shew
for
it
was
a
very
nonsensical
way
of
going
to
work
and
so
proposed
to
my
uncle
toby
that
they
should
have
a
little
model
of
a
town
built
for
them
to
be
run
up
together
of
slit
deals
and
then
painted
and
clapped
within
the
interior
polygon
to
serve
for
all
my
uncle
toby
felt
the
good
of
the
project
instantly
and
instantly
agreed
to
it
but
with
the
addition
of
two
singular
improvements
of
which
he
was
almost
as
proud
as
if
he
had
been
the
original
inventor
of
the
project
itself
the
one
was
to
have
the
town
built
exactly
in
the
style
of
those
of
which
it
was
most
likely
to
be
the
representative
with
grated
windows
and
the
gable
ends
of
the
houses
facing
the
streets
as
those
in
ghent
and
bruges
and
the
rest
of
the
towns
in
brabant
and
flanders
the
other
was
not
to
have
the
houses
run
up
together
as
the
corporal
proposed
but
to
have
every
house
independent
to
hook
on
or
off
so
as
to
form
into
the
plan
of
whatever
town
they
pleased
this
was
put
directly
into
hand
and
many
and
many
a
look
of
mutual
congratulation
was
exchanged
between
my
uncle
toby
and
the
corporal
as
the
carpenter
did
the
work
it
answered
prodigiously
the
next
summer
the
town
was
a
perfect
proteus
it
was
landen
and
trerebach
and
santvliet
and
drusen
and
hagenau
and
then
it
was
ostend
and
menin
and
aeth
and
dendermond
surely
never
did
any
town
act
so
many
parts
since
sodom
and
gomorrah
as
my
uncle
toby
town
did
in
the
fourth
year
my
uncle
toby
thinking
a
town
looked
foolishly
without
a
church
added
a
very
fine
one
with
a
trim
was
for
having
bells
in
it
my
uncle
toby
said
the
metal
had
better
be
cast
into
cannon
this
led
the
way
the
next
campaign
for
half
a
dozen
brass
to
be
planted
three
and
three
on
each
side
of
my
uncle
and
in
a
short
time
these
led
the
way
for
a
train
of
somewhat
larger
and
so
on
as
must
always
be
the
case
in
affairs
from
pieces
of
half
an
inch
bore
till
it
came
at
last
to
my
father
jack
boots
the
next
year
which
was
that
in
which
lisle
was
besieged
and
at
the
close
of
which
both
ghent
and
bruges
fell
into
our
hands
my
uncle
toby
was
sadly
put
to
it
for
proper
ammunition
i
say
proper
ammunition
because
his
great
artillery
would
not
bear
powder
and
was
well
for
the
shandy
family
they
would
not
for
so
full
were
the
papers
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
siege
of
the
incessant
firings
kept
up
by
the
besiegers
and
so
heated
was
my
uncle
toby
imagination
with
the
accounts
of
them
that
he
had
infallibly
shot
away
all
his
estate
something
therefore
was
wanting
as
a
succedaneum
especially
in
one
or
two
of
the
more
violent
paroxysms
of
the
siege
to
keep
up
something
like
a
continual
firing
in
the
imagination
and
this
something
the
corporal
whose
principal
strength
lay
in
invention
supplied
by
an
entire
new
system
of
battering
of
his
own
without
which
this
had
been
objected
to
by
military
critics
to
the
end
of
the
world
as
one
of
the
great
desiderata
of
my
uncle
toby
apparatus
this
will
not
be
explained
the
worse
for
setting
off
as
i
generally
do
at
a
little
distance
from
the
subject
chapter
with
two
or
three
other
trinkets
small
in
themselves
but
of
great
regard
which
poor
tom
the
corporal
unfortunate
brother
had
sent
him
over
with
the
account
of
his
marriage
with
the
jew
widow
there
was
a
and
two
turkish
the
i
shall
describe
by
and
the
turkish
had
nothing
particular
in
them
they
were
fitted
up
and
ornamented
as
usual
with
flexible
tubes
of
morocco
leather
and
gold
wire
and
mounted
at
their
ends
the
one
of
them
with
ivory
the
other
with
black
ebony
tipp
with
silver
my
father
who
saw
all
things
in
lights
different
from
the
rest
of
the
world
would
say
to
the
corporal
that
he
ought
to
look
upon
these
two
presents
more
as
tokens
of
his
brother
nicety
than
his
tom
did
not
care
trim
he
would
say
to
put
on
the
cap
or
to
smoke
in
the
of
a
god
bless
your
honour
the
corporal
would
say
giving
a
strong
reason
to
the
contrary
how
can
that
be
the
was
scarlet
of
a
superfine
spanish
cloth
dyed
in
grain
and
mounted
all
round
with
fur
except
about
four
inches
in
the
front
which
was
faced
with
a
light
blue
slightly
embroidered
and
seemed
to
have
been
the
property
of
a
portuguese
not
of
foot
but
of
horse
as
the
word
denotes
the
corporal
was
not
a
little
proud
of
it
as
well
for
its
own
sake
as
the
sake
of
the
giver
so
seldom
or
never
put
it
on
but
upon
and
yet
never
was
a
put
to
so
many
uses
for
in
all
controverted
points
whether
military
or
culinary
provided
the
corporal
was
sure
he
was
in
the
right
it
was
either
his
oath
his
wager
or
his
gift
was
his
gift
in
the
present
case
i
be
bound
said
the
corporal
speaking
to
himself
to
give
away
my
to
the
first
beggar
who
comes
to
the
door
if
i
do
not
manage
this
matter
to
his
honour
satisfaction
the
completion
was
no
further
off
than
the
very
next
morning
which
was
that
of
the
storm
of
the
counterscarp
betwixt
the
lower
deule
to
the
right
and
the
gate
andrew
and
on
the
left
between
and
the
river
as
this
was
the
most
memorable
attack
in
the
whole
war
the
most
gallant
and
obstinate
on
both
sides
and
i
must
add
the
most
bloody
too
for
it
cost
the
allies
themselves
that
morning
above
eleven
hundred
men
my
uncle
toby
prepared
himself
for
it
with
a
more
than
ordinary
solemnity
the
eve
which
preceded
as
my
uncle
toby
went
to
bed
he
ordered
his
ramallie
wig
which
had
laid
inside
out
for
many
years
in
the
corner
of
an
old
campaigning
trunk
which
stood
by
his
bedside
to
be
taken
out
and
laid
upon
the
lid
of
it
ready
for
the
morning
and
the
very
first
thing
he
did
in
his
shirt
when
he
had
stepped
out
of
bed
my
uncle
toby
after
he
had
turned
the
rough
side
outwards
put
it
on
this
done
he
proceeded
next
to
his
breeches
and
having
buttoned
the
he
forthwith
buckled
on
his
and
had
got
his
sword
half
way
in
when
he
considered
he
should
want
shaving
and
that
it
would
be
very
inconvenient
doing
it
with
his
sword
on
so
took
it
off
in
essaying
to
put
on
his
regimental
coat
and
waistcoat
my
uncle
toby
found
the
same
objection
in
his
wig
so
that
went
off
too
so
that
what
with
one
thing
and
what
with
another
as
always
falls
out
when
a
man
is
in
the
most
haste
was
ten
which
was
half
an
hour
later
than
his
usual
time
before
my
uncle
toby
sallied
out
chapter
my
uncle
toby
had
scarce
turned
the
corner
of
his
yew
hedge
which
separated
his
from
his
when
he
perceived
the
corporal
had
begun
the
attack
without
let
me
stop
and
give
you
a
picture
of
the
corporal
apparatus
and
of
the
corporal
himself
in
the
height
of
his
attack
just
as
it
struck
my
uncle
toby
as
he
turned
towards
the
where
the
corporal
was
at
work
for
in
nature
there
is
not
such
another
nor
can
any
combination
of
all
that
is
grotesque
and
whimsical
in
her
works
produce
its
equal
the
corporal
tread
lightly
on
his
ashes
ye
men
of
genius
for
he
was
your
kinsman
weed
his
grave
clean
ye
men
of
goodness
for
he
was
your
oh
corporal
had
i
thee
but
now
now
that
i
am
able
to
give
thee
a
dinner
and
protection
how
would
i
cherish
thee
thou
wear
thy
every
hour
of
the
day
and
every
day
of
the
and
when
it
was
worn
out
i
would
purchase
thee
a
couple
like
it
but
alas
alas
alas
now
that
i
can
do
this
in
spite
of
their
reverences
the
occasion
is
lost
for
thou
art
gone
thy
genius
fled
up
to
the
stars
from
whence
it
came
and
that
warm
heart
of
thine
with
all
its
generous
and
open
vessels
compressed
into
a
clod
of
the
valley
but
what
what
is
this
to
that
future
and
dreaded
page
where
i
look
towards
the
velvet
pall
decorated
with
the
military
ensigns
of
thy
master
the
first
the
foremost
of
created
beings
where
i
shall
see
thee
faithful
servant
laying
his
sword
and
scabbard
with
a
trembling
hand
across
his
coffin
and
then
returning
pale
as
ashes
to
the
door
to
take
his
mourning
horse
by
the
bridle
to
follow
his
hearse
as
he
directed
thee
where
all
my
father
systems
shall
be
baffled
by
his
sorrows
and
in
spite
of
his
philosophy
i
shall
behold
him
as
he
inspects
the
lackered
plate
twice
taking
his
spectacles
from
off
his
nose
to
wipe
away
the
dew
which
nature
has
shed
upon
them
when
i
see
him
cast
in
the
rosemary
with
an
air
of
disconsolation
which
cries
through
my
ears
o
toby
in
what
corner
of
the
world
shall
i
seek
thy
fellow
gracious
powers
which
erst
have
opened
the
lips
of
the
dumb
in
his
distress
and
made
the
tongue
of
the
stammerer
speak
plain
when
i
shall
arrive
at
this
dreaded
page
deal
not
with
me
then
with
a
stinted
hand
chapter
the
corporal
who
the
night
before
had
resolved
in
his
mind
to
supply
the
grand
desideratum
of
keeping
up
something
like
an
incessant
firing
upon
the
enemy
during
the
heat
of
the
attack
had
no
further
idea
in
his
fancy
at
that
time
than
a
contrivance
of
smoking
tobacco
against
the
town
out
of
one
of
my
uncle
toby
six
which
were
planted
on
each
side
of
his
the
means
of
effecting
which
occurring
to
his
fancy
at
the
same
time
though
he
had
pledged
his
cap
he
thought
it
in
no
danger
from
the
miscarriage
of
his
projects
upon
turning
it
this
way
and
that
a
little
in
his
mind
he
soon
began
to
find
out
that
by
means
of
his
two
turkish
with
the
supplement
of
three
smaller
tubes
of
at
each
of
their
lower
ends
to
be
tagg
by
the
same
number
of
fitted
to
the
and
sealed
with
clay
next
the
cannon
and
then
tied
hermetically
with
waxed
silk
at
their
several
insertions
into
the
morocco
tube
he
should
be
able
to
fire
the
six
all
together
and
with
the
same
ease
as
to
fire
let
no
man
say
from
what
taggs
and
jaggs
hints
may
not
be
cut
out
for
the
advancement
of
human
knowledge
let
no
man
who
has
read
my
first
and
second
beds
of
justice
ever
rise
up
and
say
again
from
collision
of
what
kinds
of
bodies
light
may
or
may
not
be
struck
out
to
carry
the
arts
and
sciences
up
to
heaven
thou
knowest
how
i
love
them
thou
knowest
the
secrets
of
my
heart
and
that
i
would
this
moment
give
my
shirt
thou
art
a
fool
shandy
says
eugenius
for
thou
hast
but
a
dozen
in
the
world
and
break
thy
no
matter
for
that
eugenius
i
would
give
the
shirt
off
my
back
to
be
burnt
into
tinder
were
it
only
to
satisfy
one
feverish
enquirer
how
many
sparks
at
one
good
stroke
a
good
flint
and
steel
could
strike
into
the
tail
of
think
ye
not
that
in
striking
these
in
he
might
strike
something
out
as
sure
as
a
but
this
project
by
the
bye
the
corporal
sat
up
the
best
part
of
the
night
in
bringing
his
to
perfection
and
having
made
a
sufficient
proof
of
his
cannon
with
charging
them
to
the
top
with
tobacco
he
went
with
contentment
to
bed
chapter
the
corporal
had
slipped
out
about
ten
minutes
before
my
uncle
toby
in
order
to
fix
his
apparatus
and
just
give
the
enemy
a
shot
or
two
before
my
uncle
toby
came
he
had
drawn
the
six
for
this
end
all
close
up
together
in
front
of
my
uncle
toby
leaving
only
an
interval
of
about
a
yard
and
a
half
betwixt
the
three
on
the
right
and
left
for
the
convenience
of
charging
and
the
sake
possibly
of
two
batteries
which
he
might
think
double
the
honour
of
one
in
the
rear
and
facing
this
opening
with
his
back
to
the
door
of
the
for
fear
of
being
flanked
had
the
corporal
wisely
taken
his
post
he
held
the
ivory
pipe
appertaining
to
the
battery
on
the
right
betwixt
the
finger
and
thumb
of
his
right
hand
and
the
ebony
pipe
tipp
with
silver
which
appertained
to
the
battery
on
the
left
betwixt
the
finger
and
thumb
of
the
other
and
with
his
right
knee
fixed
firm
upon
the
ground
as
if
in
the
front
rank
of
his
platoon
was
the
corporal
with
his
upon
his
head
furiously
playing
off
his
two
cross
batteries
at
the
same
time
against
the
which
faced
the
counterscarp
where
the
attack
was
to
be
made
that
morning
his
first
intention
as
i
said
was
no
more
than
giving
the
enemy
a
single
puff
or
two
but
the
pleasure
of
the
puffs
as
well
as
the
puffing
had
insensibly
got
hold
of
the
corporal
and
drawn
him
on
from
puff
to
puff
into
the
very
height
of
the
attack
by
the
time
my
uncle
toby
joined
him
was
well
for
my
father
that
my
uncle
toby
had
not
his
will
to
make
that
day
chapter
my
uncle
toby
took
the
ivory
pipe
out
of
the
corporal
hand
looked
at
it
for
half
a
minute
and
returned
it
in
less
than
two
minutes
my
uncle
toby
took
the
pipe
from
the
corporal
again
and
raised
it
half
way
to
his
mouth
then
hastily
gave
it
back
a
second
time
the
corporal
redoubled
the
attack
my
uncle
toby
smiled
then
looked
grave
then
smiled
for
a
moment
then
looked
serious
for
a
long
time
give
me
hold
of
the
ivory
pipe
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
my
uncle
toby
put
it
to
his
lips
drew
it
back
directly
gave
a
peep
over
the
hedge
never
did
my
uncle
toby
mouth
water
so
much
for
a
pipe
in
his
my
uncle
toby
retired
into
the
with
the
pipe
in
his
dear
uncle
toby
do
go
into
the
with
the
pipe
no
trusting
a
man
self
with
such
a
thing
in
such
a
corner
chapter
i
beg
the
reader
will
assist
me
here
to
wheel
off
my
uncle
ordnance
behind
the
scenes
to
remove
his
and
clear
the
theatre
if
possible
of
and
half
moons
and
get
the
rest
of
his
military
apparatus
out
of
the
way
that
done
my
dear
friend
garrick
we
snuff
the
candles
bright
sweep
the
stage
with
a
new
broom
draw
up
the
curtain
and
exhibit
my
uncle
toby
dressed
in
a
new
character
throughout
which
the
world
can
have
no
idea
how
he
will
act
and
yet
if
pity
be
to
love
and
bravery
no
alien
to
it
you
have
seen
enough
of
my
uncle
toby
in
these
to
trace
these
family
likenesses
betwixt
the
two
passions
in
case
there
is
one
to
your
heart
content
vain
science
thou
assistest
us
in
no
case
of
this
kind
and
thou
puzzlest
us
in
every
one
there
was
madam
in
my
uncle
toby
a
singleness
of
heart
which
misled
him
so
far
out
of
the
little
serpentine
tracks
in
which
things
of
this
nature
usually
go
on
you
can
you
can
have
no
conception
of
it
with
this
there
was
a
plainness
and
simplicity
of
thinking
with
such
an
unmistrusting
ignorance
of
the
plies
and
foldings
of
the
heart
of
woman
and
so
naked
and
defenceless
did
he
stand
before
you
when
a
siege
was
out
of
his
head
that
you
might
have
stood
behind
any
one
of
your
serpentine
walks
and
shot
my
uncle
toby
ten
times
in
a
day
through
his
liver
if
nine
times
in
a
day
madam
had
not
served
your
purpose
with
all
this
madam
and
what
confounded
every
thing
as
much
on
the
other
hand
my
uncle
toby
had
that
unparalleled
modesty
of
nature
i
once
told
you
of
and
which
by
the
bye
stood
eternal
sentry
upon
his
feelings
that
you
might
as
soon
but
where
am
i
going
these
reflections
crowd
in
upon
me
ten
pages
at
least
too
soon
and
take
up
that
time
which
i
ought
to
bestow
upon
facts
chapter
of
the
few
legitimate
sons
of
adam
whose
breasts
never
felt
what
the
sting
of
love
was
maintaining
first
all
mysogynists
to
be
bastards
the
greatest
heroes
of
ancient
and
modern
story
have
carried
off
amongst
them
nine
parts
in
ten
of
the
honour
and
i
wish
for
their
sakes
i
had
the
key
of
my
study
out
of
my
only
for
five
minutes
to
tell
you
their
names
recollect
them
i
can
not
so
be
content
to
accept
of
these
for
the
present
in
their
stead
there
was
the
great
king
aldrovandus
and
bosphorus
and
cappadocius
and
dardanus
and
pontus
and
asius
to
say
nothing
of
the
charles

xiith
whom
the
countess
of
k
herself
could
make
nothing
there
was
babylonicus
and
mediterraneus
and
polixenes
and
persicus
and
prusicus
not
one
of
whom
except
cappadocius
and
pontus
who
were
both
a
little
suspected
ever
once
bowed
down
his
breast
to
the
goddess
the
truth
is
they
had
all
of
them
something
else
to
do
and
so
had
my
uncle
toby
till
fate
till
fate
i
say
envying
his
name
the
glory
of
being
handed
down
to
posterity
with
aldrovandus
and
the
rest
she
basely
patched
up
the
peace
of
utrecht
believe
me
sirs
was
the
worst
deed
she
did
that
year
chapter
amongst
the
many
ill
consequences
of
the
treaty
of
utrecht
it
was
within
a
point
of
giving
my
uncle
toby
a
surfeit
of
sieges
and
though
he
recovered
his
appetite
afterwards
yet
calais
itself
left
not
a
deeper
scar
in
mary
heart
than
utrecht
upon
my
uncle
toby
to
the
end
of
his
life
he
never
could
hear
utrecht
mentioned
upon
any
account
whatever
or
so
much
as
read
an
article
of
news
extracted
out
of
the
utrecht
gazette
without
fetching
a
sigh
as
if
his
heart
would
break
in
twain
my
father
who
was
a
great
and
consequently
a
very
dangerous
person
for
a
man
to
sit
by
either
laughing
or
crying
for
he
generally
knew
your
motive
for
doing
both
much
better
than
you
knew
it
yourself
would
always
console
my
uncle
toby
upon
these
occasions
in
a
way
which
shewed
plainly
he
imagined
my
uncle
toby
grieved
for
nothing
in
the
whole
affair
so
much
as
the
loss
of
his
never
mind
brother
toby
he
would
say
by
god
blessing
we
shall
have
another
war
break
out
again
some
of
these
days
and
when
it
does
the
belligerent
powers
if
they
would
hang
themselves
can
not
keep
us
out
of
i
defy
my
dear
toby
he
would
add
to
take
countries
without
taking
towns
or
towns
without
sieges
my
uncle
toby
never
took
this
of
my
father
at
his
he
thought
the
stroke
ungenerous
and
the
more
so
because
in
striking
the
horse
he
hit
the
rider
too
and
in
the
most
dishonourable
part
a
blow
could
fall
so
that
upon
these
occasions
he
always
laid
down
his
pipe
upon
the
table
with
more
fire
to
defend
himself
than
common
i
told
the
reader
this
time
two
years
that
my
uncle
toby
was
not
eloquent
and
in
the
very
same
page
gave
an
instance
to
the
contrary
i
repeat
the
observation
and
a
fact
which
contradicts
it
he
was
not
eloquent
it
was
not
easy
to
my
uncle
toby
to
make
long
harangues
and
he
hated
florid
ones
but
there
were
occasions
where
the
stream
overflowed
the
man
and
ran
so
counter
to
its
usual
course
that
in
some
parts
my
uncle
toby
for
a
time
was
at
least
equal
to
tertullus
but
in
others
in
my
own
opinion
infinitely
above
him
my
father
was
so
highly
pleased
with
one
of
these
apologetical
orations
of
my
uncle
toby
which
he
had
delivered
one
evening
before
him
and
yorick
that
he
wrote
it
down
before
he
went
to
bed
i
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
with
it
amongst
my
father
papers
with
here
and
there
an
insertion
of
his
own
betwixt
two
crooks
thus
and
is
endorsed
my
brother
toby
justification
of
his
own
principles
and
conduct
in
wishing
to
continue
the
war
i
may
safely
say
i
have
read
over
this
apologetical
oration
of
my
uncle
toby
a
hundred
times
and
think
it
so
fine
a
model
of
defence
and
shews
so
sweet
a
temperament
of
gallantry
and
good
principles
in
him
that
i
give
it
the
world
word
for
word
interlineations
and
all
as
i
find
it
chapter
my
uncle
toby
apologetical
oration
i
am
not
insensible
brother
shandy
that
when
a
man
whose
profession
is
arms
wishes
as
i
have
done
for
war
it
has
an
ill
aspect
to
the
world
and
that
how
just
and
right
soever
his
motives
the
intentions
may
be
he
stands
in
an
uneasy
posture
in
vindicating
himself
from
private
views
in
doing
it
for
this
cause
if
a
soldier
is
a
prudent
man
which
he
may
be
without
being
a
jot
the
less
brave
he
will
be
sure
not
to
utter
his
wish
in
the
hearing
of
an
enemy
for
say
what
he
will
an
enemy
will
not
believe
he
will
be
cautious
of
doing
it
even
to
a
friend
lest
he
may
suffer
in
his
esteem
but
if
his
heart
is
overcharged
and
a
secret
sigh
for
arms
must
have
its
vent
he
will
reserve
it
for
the
ear
of
a
brother
who
knows
his
character
to
the
bottom
and
what
his
true
notions
dispositions
and
principles
of
honour
are
what
i
hope
i
have
been
in
all
these
brother
shandy
would
be
unbecoming
in
me
to
say
much
worse
i
know
have
i
been
than
i
ought
and
something
worse
perhaps
than
i
think
but
such
as
i
am
you
my
dear
brother
shandy
who
have
sucked
the
same
breasts
with
me
and
with
whom
i
have
been
brought
up
from
my
cradle
and
from
whose
knowledge
from
the
first
hours
of
our
boyish
pastimes
down
to
this
i
have
concealed
no
one
action
of
my
life
and
scarce
a
thought
in
it
such
as
i
am
brother
you
must
by
this
time
know
me
with
all
my
vices
and
with
all
my
weaknesses
too
whether
of
my
age
my
temper
my
passions
or
my
understanding
tell
me
then
my
dear
brother
shandy
upon
which
of
them
it
is
that
when
i
condemned
the
peace
of
utrecht
and
grieved
the
war
was
not
carried
on
with
vigour
a
little
longer
you
should
think
your
brother
did
it
upon
unworthy
views
or
that
in
wishing
for
war
he
should
be
bad
enough
to
wish
more
of
his
slain
more
slaves
made
and
more
families
driven
from
their
peaceful
habitations
merely
for
his
own
pleasure
tell
me
brother
shandy
upon
what
one
deed
of
mine
do
you
ground
it
the
devil
a
deed
do
i
know
of
dear
toby
but
one
for
a
hundred
pounds
which
i
lent
thee
to
carry
on
these
cursed
sieges
if
when
i
was
a
i
could
not
hear
a
drum
beat
but
my
heart
beat
with
it
was
it
my
fault
did
i
plant
the
propensity
there
did
i
sound
the
alarm
within
or
nature
when
guy
earl
of
warwick
and
parismus
and
parismenus
and
valentine
and
orson
and
the
seven
champions
of
england
were
handed
around
the
school
were
they
not
all
purchased
with
my
own
was
that
selfish
brother
shandy
when
we
read
over
the
siege
of
troy
which
lasted
ten
years
and
eight
months
though
with
such
a
train
of
artillery
as
we
had
at
namur
the
town
might
have
been
carried
in
a
week
was
i
not
as
much
concerned
for
the
destruction
of
the
greeks
and
trojans
as
any
boy
of
the
whole
school
had
i
not
three
strokes
of
a
ferula
given
me
two
on
my
right
hand
and
one
on
my
left
for
calling
helena
a
bitch
for
it
did
any
one
of
you
shed
more
tears
for
hector
and
when
king
priam
came
to
the
camp
to
beg
his
body
and
returned
weeping
back
to
troy
without
it
you
know
brother
i
could
not
eat
my
did
that
bespeak
me
cruel
or
because
brother
shandy
my
blood
flew
out
into
the
camp
and
my
heart
panted
for
war
was
it
a
proof
it
could
not
ache
for
the
distresses
of
war
too
o
brother
is
one
thing
for
a
soldier
to
gather
laurels
and
is
another
to
scatter
who
told
thee
my
dear
toby
that
cypress
was
used
by
the
antients
on
mournful
occasions
is
one
thing
brother
shandy
for
a
soldier
to
hazard
his
own
life
to
leap
first
down
into
the
trench
where
he
is
sure
to
be
cut
in
pieces
is
one
thing
from
public
spirit
and
a
thirst
of
glory
to
enter
the
breach
the
first
man
to
stand
in
the
foremost
rank
and
march
bravely
on
with
drums
and
trumpets
and
colours
flying
about
his
ears
is
one
thing
i
say
brother
shandy
to
do
this
and
another
thing
to
reflect
on
the
miseries
of
war
to
view
the
desolations
of
whole
countries
and
consider
the
intolerable
fatigues
and
hardships
which
the
soldier
himself
the
instrument
who
works
them
is
forced
for
sixpence
a
day
if
he
can
get
it
to
undergo
need
i
be
told
dear
yorick
as
i
was
by
you
in
le
fever
funeral
sermon
that
so
soft
and
gentle
a
creature
born
to
love
to
mercy
and
kindness
as
man
is
was
not
shaped
for
this
but
why
did
you
not
add
yorick
if
not
by
nature
that
he
is
so
by
necessity
for
what
is
war
what
is
it
yorick
when
fought
as
ours
has
been
upon
principles
of
liberty
and
upon
principles
of
honour
what
is
it
but
the
getting
together
of
quiet
and
harmless
people
with
their
swords
in
their
hands
to
keep
the
ambitious
and
the
turbulent
within
bounds
and
heaven
is
my
witness
brother
shandy
that
the
pleasure
i
have
taken
in
these
things
and
that
infinite
delight
in
particular
which
has
attended
my
sieges
in
my
has
arose
within
me
and
i
hope
in
the
corporal
too
from
the
consciousness
we
both
had
that
in
carrying
them
on
we
were
answering
the
great
ends
of
our
creation
chapter
i
told
the
christian
reader
i
say
christian
hoping
he
is
one
and
if
he
is
not
i
am
sorry
for
it
and
only
beg
he
will
consider
the
matter
with
himself
and
not
lay
the
blame
entirely
upon
this
book
i
told
him
sir
for
in
good
truth
when
a
man
is
telling
a
story
in
the
strange
way
i
do
mine
he
is
obliged
continually
to
be
going
backwards
and
forwards
to
keep
all
tight
together
in
the
reader
fancy
which
for
my
own
part
if
i
did
not
take
heed
to
do
more
than
at
first
there
is
so
much
unfixed
and
equivocal
matter
starting
up
with
so
many
breaks
and
gaps
in
it
and
so
little
service
do
the
stars
afford
which
nevertheless
i
hang
up
in
some
of
the
darkest
passages
knowing
that
the
world
is
apt
to
lose
its
way
with
all
the
lights
the
sun
itself
at
can
give
it
and
now
you
see
i
am
lost
myself
but
is
my
father
fault
and
whenever
my
brains
come
to
be
dissected
you
will
perceive
without
spectacles
that
he
has
left
a
large
uneven
thread
as
you
sometimes
see
in
an
unsaleable
piece
of
cambrick
running
along
the
whole
length
of
the
web
and
so
untowardly
you
can
not
so
much
as
cut
out
a
here
i
hang
up
a
couple
of
lights
again
or
a
fillet
or
a
but
it
is
seen
or
quanto
id
diligentias
in
liberis
procreandis
cavendum
sayeth
cardan
all
which
being
considered
and
that
you
see
is
morally
impracticable
for
me
to
wind
this
round
to
where
i
set
out
i
begin
the
chapter
over
again
chapter
i
told
the
christian
reader
in
the
beginning
of
the
chapter
which
preceded
my
uncle
toby
apologetical
oration
though
in
a
different
trope
from
what
i
should
make
use
of
now
that
the
peace
of
utrecht
was
within
an
ace
of
creating
the
same
shyness
betwixt
my
uncle
toby
and
his
as
it
did
betwixt
the
queen
and
the
rest
of
the
confederating
powers
there
is
an
indignant
way
in
which
a
man
sometimes
dismounts
his
horse
which
as
good
as
says
to
him
go
afoot
sir
all
the
days
of
my
life
before
i
would
ride
a
single
mile
upon
your
back
again
now
my
uncle
toby
could
not
be
said
to
dismount
his
horse
in
this
manner
for
in
strictness
of
language
he
could
not
be
said
to
dismount
his
horse
at
all
his
horse
rather
flung
him
and
somewhat
viciously
which
made
my
uncle
toby
take
it
ten
times
more
unkindly
let
this
matter
be
settled
by
as
they
it
created
i
say
a
sort
of
shyness
betwixt
my
uncle
toby
and
his
he
had
no
occasion
for
him
from
the
month
of
march
to
november
which
was
the
summer
after
the
articles
were
signed
except
it
was
now
and
then
to
take
a
short
ride
out
just
to
see
that
the
fortifications
and
harbour
of
dunkirk
were
demolished
according
to
stipulation
the
french
were
so
backwards
all
that
summer
in
setting
about
that
affair
and
monsieur
tugghe
the
deputy
from
the
magistrates
of
dunkirk
presented
so
many
affecting
petitions
to
the
queen
beseeching
her
majesty
to
cause
only
her
thunderbolts
to
fall
upon
the
martial
works
which
might
have
incurred
her
displeasure
but
to
spare
to
spare
the
mole
for
the
mole
sake
which
in
its
naked
situation
could
be
no
more
than
an
object
of
pity
and
the
queen
who
was
but
a
woman
being
of
a
pitiful
disposition
and
her
ministers
also
they
not
wishing
in
their
hearts
to
have
the
town
dismantled
for
these
private
reasons
so
that
the
whole
went
heavily
on
with
my
uncle
toby
insomuch
that
it
was
not
within
three
full
months
after
he
and
the
corporal
had
constructed
the
town
and
put
it
in
a
condition
to
be
destroyed
that
the
several
commandants
commissaries
deputies
negociators
and
intendants
would
permit
him
to
set
about
fatal
interval
of
inactivity
the
corporal
was
for
beginning
the
demolition
by
making
a
breach
in
the
ramparts
or
main
fortifications
of
the
town
no
that
will
never
do
corporal
said
my
uncle
toby
for
in
going
that
way
to
work
with
the
town
the
english
garrison
will
not
be
safe
in
it
an
hour
because
if
the
french
are
treacherous
they
are
as
treacherous
as
devils
please
your
honour
said
the
corporal
it
gives
me
concern
always
when
i
hear
it
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
for
they
do
want
personal
bravery
and
if
a
breach
is
made
in
the
ramparts
they
may
enter
it
and
make
themselves
masters
of
the
place
when
they
please
let
them
enter
it
said
the
corporal
lifting
up
his
pioneer
spade
in
both
his
hands
as
if
he
was
going
to
lay
about
him
with
it
let
them
enter
an
please
your
honour
if
they
in
cases
like
this
corporal
said
my
uncle
toby
slipping
his
right
hand
down
to
the
middle
of
his
cane
and
holding
it
afterwards
with
his
extended
is
no
part
of
the
consideration
of
a
commandant
what
the
enemy
dare
or
what
they
dare
not
do
he
must
act
with
prudence
we
will
begin
with
the
outworks
both
towards
the
sea
and
the
land
and
particularly
with
fort
louis
the
most
distant
of
them
all
and
demolish
it
first
and
the
rest
one
by
one
both
on
our
right
and
left
as
we
retreat
towards
the
town
then
we
demolish
the
mole
next
fill
up
the
harbour
then
retire
into
the
citadel
and
blow
it
up
into
the
air
and
having
done
that
corporal
we
embark
for
we
are
there
quoth
the
corporal
recollecting
himself
very
true
said
my
uncle
toby
looking
at
the
church
chapter
a
delusive
delicious
consultation
or
two
of
this
kind
betwixt
my
uncle
toby
and
trim
upon
the
demolition
of
dunkirk
for
a
moment
rallied
back
the
ideas
of
those
pleasures
which
were
slipping
from
under
him
still
still
all
went
on
heavily
the
magic
left
the
mind
the
weaker
stillness
with
silence
at
her
back
entered
the
solitary
parlour
and
drew
their
gauzy
mantle
over
my
uncle
toby
head
and
listlessness
with
her
lax
fibre
and
undirected
eye
sat
quietly
down
beside
him
in
his
no
longer
amberg
and
rhinberg
and
limbourg
and
huy
and
bonn
in
one
year
and
the
prospect
of
landen
and
trerebach
and
drusen
and
dendermond
the
next
hurried
on
the
blood
no
longer
did
saps
and
mines
and
blinds
and
gabions
and
palisadoes
keep
out
this
fair
enemy
of
man
repose
no
more
could
my
uncle
toby
after
passing
the
french
lines
as
he
eat
his
egg
at
supper
from
thence
break
into
the
heart
of
france
cross
over
the
oyes
and
with
all
picardie
open
behind
him
march
up
to
the
gates
of
paris
and
fall
asleep
with
nothing
but
ideas
of
glory
no
more
was
he
to
dream
he
had
fixed
the
royal
standard
upon
the
tower
of
the
bastile
and
awake
with
it
streaming
in
his
head
softer
visions
gentler
vibrations
stole
sweetly
in
upon
his
slumbers
the
trumpet
of
war
fell
out
of
his
hands
he
took
up
the
lute
sweet
instrument
of
all
others
the
most
delicate
the
most
difficult
how
wilt
thou
touch
it
my
dear
uncle
toby
chapter
now
because
i
have
once
or
twice
said
in
my
inconsiderate
way
of
talking
that
i
was
confident
the
following
memoirs
of
my
uncle
courtship
of
widow
wadman
whenever
i
got
time
to
write
them
would
turn
out
one
of
the
most
complete
systems
both
of
the
elementary
and
practical
part
of
love
and
that
ever
was
addressed
to
the
world
are
you
to
imagine
from
thence
that
i
shall
set
out
with
a
description
of
what
love
is
whether
part
god
and
part
devil
as
plotinus
will
have
it
or
by
a
more
critical
equation
and
supposing
the
whole
of
love
to
be
as
ten
to
determine
with
ficinus
many
parts
of
it
the
one
and
how
many
the
other
or
whether
it
is
all
of
it
one
great
devil
from
head
to
tail
as
plato
has
taken
upon
him
to
pronounce
concerning
which
conceit
of
his
i
shall
not
offer
my
opinion
but
my
opinion
of
plato
is
this
that
he
appears
from
this
instance
to
have
been
a
man
of
much
the
same
temper
and
way
of
reasoning
with
doctor
baynyard
who
being
a
great
enemy
to
blisters
as
imagining
that
half
a
dozen
of
at
once
would
draw
a
man
as
surely
to
his
grave
as
a
herse
and
six
rashly
concluded
that
the
devil
himself
was
nothing
in
the
world
but
one
great
bouncing
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
people
who
allow
themselves
this
monstrous
liberty
in
arguing
but
what
nazianzen
cried
out
that
is
polemically
to
philagrius
greek
o
rare
is
fine
reasoning
sir
indeed
greek
and
most
nobly
do
you
aim
at
truth
when
you
philosophize
about
it
in
your
moods
and
passions
nor
is
it
to
be
imagined
for
the
same
reason
i
should
stop
to
inquire
whether
love
is
a
disease
or
embroil
myself
with
rhasis
and
dioscorides
whether
the
seat
of
it
is
in
the
brain
or
liver
because
this
would
lead
me
on
to
an
examination
of
the
two
very
opposite
manners
in
which
patients
have
been
treated
the
one
of
aoetius
who
always
begun
with
a
cooling
clyster
of
hempseed
and
bruised
cucumbers
and
followed
on
with
thin
potations
of
and
purslane
to
which
he
added
a
pinch
of
snuff
of
the
herb
hanea
and
where
aoetius
durst
venture
it
his
the
other
that
of
gordonius
who
in
his
cap
de
amore
directs
they
should
be
thrashed
putorem
usque
till
they
stink
again
these
are
disquisitions
which
my
father
who
had
laid
in
a
great
stock
of
knowledge
of
this
kind
will
be
very
busy
with
in
the
progress
of
my
uncle
toby
affairs
i
must
anticipate
thus
much
that
from
his
theories
of
love
with
which
by
the
way
he
contrived
to
crucify
my
uncle
toby
mind
almost
as
much
as
his
amours
themselves
he
took
a
single
step
into
practice
and
by
means
of
a
camphorated
cerecloth
which
he
found
means
to
impose
upon
the
taylor
for
buckram
whilst
he
was
making
my
uncle
toby
a
new
pair
of
breeches
he
produced
effect
upon
my
uncle
toby
without
the
disgrace
what
changes
this
produced
will
be
read
in
its
proper
place
all
that
is
needful
to
be
added
to
the
anecdote
is
this
that
whatever
effect
it
had
upon
my
uncle
toby
it
had
a
vile
effect
upon
the
house
and
if
my
uncle
toby
had
not
smoaked
it
down
as
he
did
it
might
have
had
a
vile
effect
upon
my
father
too
chapter
come
out
of
itself
by
and
all
i
contend
for
is
that
i
am
not
obliged
to
set
out
with
a
definition
of
what
love
is
and
so
long
as
i
can
go
on
with
my
story
intelligibly
with
the
help
of
the
word
itself
without
any
other
idea
to
it
than
what
i
have
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
world
why
should
i
differ
from
it
a
moment
before
the
time
when
i
can
get
on
no
further
and
find
myself
entangled
on
all
sides
of
this
mystic
labyrinth
my
opinion
will
then
come
in
in
course
and
lead
me
out
at
present
i
hope
i
shall
be
sufficiently
understood
in
telling
the
reader
my
uncle
toby
fell
in
love
not
that
the
phrase
is
at
all
to
my
liking
for
to
say
a
man
is
fallen
in
love
or
that
he
is
deeply
in
love
or
up
to
the
ears
in
love
and
sometimes
even
over
head
and
ears
in
it
carries
an
idiomatical
kind
of
implication
that
love
is
a
thing
below
a
man
this
is
recurring
again
to
plato
opinion
which
with
all
his
divinityship
i
hold
to
be
damnable
and
heretical
and
so
much
for
that
let
love
therefore
be
what
it
will
my
uncle
toby
fell
into
it
and
possibly
gentle
reader
with
such
a
temptation
so
wouldst
thou
for
never
did
thy
eyes
behold
or
thy
concupiscence
covet
any
thing
in
this

more
concupiscible

sit
down
sir
paint
her
to
your
own
mind
as
like
your
mistress
as
you
can
as
unlike
your
wife
as
your
conscience
will
let
you
is
all
one
to
me
please
but
your
own
fancy
in
it
blank
page
was
ever
any
thing
in
nature
so
sweet
so
exquisite
then
dear
sir
how
could
my
uncle
toby
resist
it
thrice
happy
book
thou
wilt
have
one
page
at
least
within
thy
covers
which
malice
will
not
blacken
and
which
ignorance
can
not
misrepresent
chapter
as
susannah
was
informed
by
an
express
from
bridget
of
my
uncle
toby
falling
in
love
with
her
mistress
fifteen
days
before
it
happened
the
contents
of
which
express
susannah
communicated
to
my
mother
the
next
day
it
has
just
given
me
an
opportunity
of
entering
upon
my
uncle
toby
amours
a
fortnight
before
their
existence
i
have
an
article
of
news
to
tell
you
shandy
quoth
my
mother
which
will
surprise
you
now
my
father
was
then
holding
one
of
his
second
beds
of
justice
and
was
musing
within
himself
about
the
hardships
of
matrimony
as
my
mother
broke
my
brother
toby
quoth
she
going
to
be
married
to
mrs
wadman
then
he
will
never
quoth
my
father
be
able
to
lie
diagonally
in
his
bed
again
as
long
as
he
lives
it
was
a
consuming
vexation
to
my
father
that
my
mother
never
asked
the
meaning
of
a
thing
she
did
not
understand
that
she
is
not
a
woman
of
science
my
father
would
say
is
her
misfortune
but
she
might
ask
a
my
mother
never
in
short
she
went
out
of
the
world
at
last
without
knowing
whether
it
turned
round
or
stood
my
father
had
officiously
told
her
above
a
thousand
times
which
way
it
was
but
she
always
forgot
for
these
reasons
a
discourse
seldom
went
on
much
further
betwixt
them
than
a
proposition
a
reply
and
a
rejoinder
at
the
end
of
which
it
generally
took
breath
for
a
few
minutes
as
in
the
affair
of
the
breeches
and
then
went
on
again
if
he
marries
be
the
worse
for
us
quoth
my
mother
not
a
said
my
father
he
may
as
well
batter
away
his
means
upon
that
as
any
thing
else
to
be
sure
said
my
mother
so
here
ended
the
proposition
the
reply
and
the
rejoinder
i
told
you
of
it
will
be
some
amusement
to
him
too
said
my
father
a
very
great
one
answered
my
mother
if
he
should
have
lord
have
mercy
upon
me
said
my
father
to
himself
chapter
i
am
now
beginning
to
get
fairly
into
my
work
and
by
the
help
of
a
vegetable
diet
with
a
few
of
the
cold
seeds
i
make
no
doubt
but
i
shall
be
able
to
go
on
with
my
uncle
toby
story
and
my
own
in
a
tolerable
straight
line
now
four
very
squiggly
lines
across
the
page
signed
and
these
were
the
four
lines
i
moved
in
through
my
first
second
third
and
fourth
volumes
alluding
to
the
first
edition
in
the
fifth
volume
i
have
been
very
good
the
precise
line
i
have
described
in
it
being
this
one
very
squiggly
line
across
the
page
with
loops
marked
a
b
c
c
c
c
c
d
by
which
it
appears
that
except
at
the
curve
marked
where
i
took
a
trip
to
navarre
and
the
indented
curve
which
is
the
short
airing
when
i
was
there
with
the
lady
baussiere
and
her
page
i
have
not
taken
the
least
frisk
of
a
digression
till
john
de
la
casse
devils
led
me
the
round
you
see
marked
for
as
for
c
c
c
c
c
they
are
nothing
but
parentheses
and
the
common
ins
and
outs
incident
to
the
lives
of
the
greatest
ministers
of
state
and
when
compared
with
what
men
have
done
or
with
my
own
transgressions
at
the
letters
abd
they
vanish
into
nothing
in
this
last
volume
i
have
done
better
still
for
from
the
end
of
le
fever
episode
to
the
beginning
of
my
uncle
toby
campaigns
i
have
scarce
stepped
a
yard
out
of
my
way
if
i
mend
at
this
rate
it
is
not
impossible
by
the
good
leave
of
his
grace
of
benevento
devils
but
i
may
arrive
hereafter
at
the
excellency
of
going
on
even
thus
straight
line
across
the
page
which
is
a
line
drawn
as
straight
as
i
could
draw
it
by
a
ruler
borrowed
for
that
purpose
turning
neither
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
this
right
line
the
for
christians
to
walk
in
say
divines
the
emblem
of
moral
rectitude
says
cicero
the
best
line
say
cabbage
planters
is
the
shortest
line
says
archimedes
which
can
be
drawn
from
one
given
point
to
i
wish
your
ladyships
would
lay
this
matter
to
heart
in
your
next
suits
what
a
journey
pray
can
you
tell
me
that
is
without
anger
before
i
write
my
chapter
upon
straight
lines
by
what
mistake
who
told
them
so
or
how
it
has
come
to
pass
that
your
men
of
wit
and
genius
have
all
along
confounded
this
line
with
the
line
of
gravitation
chapter
no
i
think
i
said
i
would
write
two
volumes
every
year
provided
the
vile
cough
which
then
tormented
me
and
which
to
this
hour
i
dread
worse
than
the
devil
would
but
give
me
leave
and
in
another
place
but
where
i
ca
recollect
now
speaking
of
my
book
as
a
machine
and
laying
my
pen
and
ruler
down
upon
the
table
in
order
to
gain
the
greater
credit
to
it
i
swore
it
should
be
kept
a
going
at
that
rate
these
forty
years
if
it
pleased
but
the
fountain
of
life
to
bless
me
so
long
with
health
and
good
spirits
now
as
for
my
spirits
little
have
i
to
lay
to
their
charge
nay
so
very
little
unless
the
mounting
me
upon
a
long
stick
and
playing
the
fool
with
me
nineteen
hours
out
of
the
be
accusations
that
on
the
contrary
i
have
much
much
to
thank
for
cheerily
have
ye
made
me
tread
the
path
of
life
with
all
the
burthens
of
it
except
its
cares
upon
my
back
in
no
one
moment
of
my
existence
that
i
remember
have
ye
once
deserted
me
or
tinged
the
objects
which
came
in
my
way
either
with
sable
or
with
a
sickly
green
in
dangers
ye
gilded
my
horizon
with
hope
and
when
death
himself
knocked
at
my
door
ye
bad
him
come
again
and
in
so
gay
a
tone
of
careless
indifference
did
ye
do
it
that
he
doubted
of
his
commission
there
must
certainly
be
some
mistake
in
this
matter
quoth
he
now
there
is
nothing
in
this
world
i
abominate
worse
than
to
be
interrupted
in
a
story
and
i
was
that
moment
telling
eugenius
a
most
tawdry
one
in
my
way
of
a
nun
who
fancied
herself
a
and
of
a
monk
damn
for
eating
a
muscle
and
was
shewing
him
the
grounds
and
justice
of
the
procedure
did
ever
so
grave
a
personage
get
into
so
vile
a
scrape
quoth
death
thou
hast
had
a
narrow
escape
tristram
said
eugenius
taking
hold
of
my
hand
as
i
finished
my
story
but
there
is
no
living
eugenius
replied
i
at
this
rate
for
as
this
son
of
a
whore
has
found
out
my
lodgings
you
call
him
rightly
said
eugenius
for
by
sin
we
are
told
he
enter
the
world
i
care
not
which
way
he
enter
quoth
i
provided
he
be
not
in
such
a
hurry
to
take
me
out
with
him
for
i
have
forty
volumes
to
write
and
forty
thousand
things
to
say
and
do
which
no
body
in
the
world
will
say
and
do
for
me
except
thyself
and
as
thou
seest
he
has
got
me
by
the
throat
for
eugenius
could
scarce
hear
me
speak
across
the
table
and
that
i
am
no
match
for
him
in
the
open
field
had
i
not
better
whilst
these
few
scatter
spirits
remain
and
these
two
spider
legs
of
mine
holding
one
of
them
up
to
him
are
able
to
support
me
had
i
not
better
eugenius
fly
for
my
life
is
my
advice
my
dear
tristram
said
eugenius
then
by
heaven
i
will
lead
him
a
dance
he
little
thinks
of
for
i
will
gallop
quoth
i
without
looking
once
behind
me
to
the
banks
of
the
garonne
and
if
i
hear
him
clattering
at
my
heels
i
scamper
away
to
mount
vesuvius
from
thence
to
joppa
and
from
joppa
to
the
world
end
where
if
he
follows
me
i
pray
god
he
may
break
his
neck
he
runs
more
risk
there
said
eugenius
than
thou
eugenius
wit
and
affection
brought
blood
into
the
cheek
from
whence
it
had
been
some
months
banish
was
a
vile
moment
to
bid
adieu
in
he
led
me
to
my
chaise
allons
said
i
the
gave
a
crack
with
his
whip
off
i
went
like
a
cannon
and
in
half
a
dozen
bounds
got
into
dover
chapter
now
hang
it
quoth
i
as
i
look
towards
the
french
coast
a
man
should
know
something
of
his
own
country
too
before
he
goes
abroad
and
i
never
gave
a
peep
into
rochester
church
or
took
notice
of
the
dock
of
chatham
or
visited
thomas
at
canterbury
though
they
all
three
laid
in
my
way
but
mine
indeed
is
a
particular
case
so
without
arguing
the
matter
further
with
thomas
or
any
one
else
i
skip
into
the
boat
and
in
five
minutes
we
got
under
sail
and
scudded
away
like
the
wind
pray
captain
quoth
i
as
i
was
going
down
into
the
cabin
is
a
man
never
overtaken
by
death
in
this
passage
why
there
is
not
time
for
a
man
to
be
sick
in
it
replied
he
what
a
cursed
lyar
for
i
am
sick
as
a
horse
quoth
i
already
what
a
brain
upside
down
the
cells
are
broke
loose
one
into
another
and
the
blood
and
the
lymph
and
the
nervous
juices
with
the
fix
and
volatile
salts
are
all
jumbled
into
one
mass
good
every
thing
turns
round
in
it
like
a
thousand
whirlpools
i
give
a
shilling
to
know
if
i
sha
write
the
clearer
for
it
sick
sick
sick
sick
when
shall
we
get
to
land
captain
they
have
hearts
like
stones
o
i
am
deadly
sick
reach
me
that
thing
boy
is
the
most
discomfiting
sickness
i
wish
i
was
at
the
bottom
madam
how
is
it
with
you
undone
undone
un
o
undone
sir
what
the
first
time
no
is
the
second
third
sixth
tenth
time
sir
what
a
trampling
over
head
hollo
cabin
boy
what
the
matter
the
wind
chopp
about
then
i
shall
meet
him
full
in
the
face
what
luck
is
chopp
about
again
master
o
the
devil
chop
it
captain
quoth
she
for
heaven
sake
let
us
get
ashore
chapter
it
is
a
great
inconvenience
to
a
man
in
a
haste
that
there
are
three
distinct
roads
between
calais
and
paris
in
behalf
of
which
there
is
so
much
to
be
said
by
the
several
deputies
from
the
towns
which
lie
along
them
that
half
a
day
is
easily
lost
in
settling
which
you
take
first
the
road
by
lisle
and
arras
which
is
the
most
about
but
most
interesting
and
instructing
the
second
that
by
amiens
which
you
may
go
if
you
would
see
chantilly
and
that
by
beauvais
which
you
may
go
if
you
will
for
this
reason
a
great
many
chuse
to
go
by
beauvais
chapter
before
i
quit
calais
a
would
say
would
not
be
amiss
to
give
some
account
of
it
now
i
think
it
very
much
amiss
that
a
man
can
not
go
quietly
through
a
town
and
let
it
alone
when
it
does
not
meddle
with
him
but
that
he
must
be
turning
about
and
drawing
his
pen
at
every
kennel
he
crosses
over
merely
o
my
conscience
for
the
sake
of
drawing
it
because
if
we
may
judge
from
what
has
been
wrote
of
these
things
by
all
who
have
wrote
and
gallop
or
who
have
and
wrote
which
is
a
different
way
still
or
who
for
more
expedition
than
the
rest
have
wrote
galloping
which
is
the
way
i
do
at
present
from
the
great
addison
who
did
it
with
his
satchel
of
school
books
hanging
at
his
a
and
galling
his
beast
crupper
at
every
stroke
there
is
not
a
gallopper
of
us
all
who
might
not
have
gone
on
ambling
quietly
in
his
own
ground
in
case
he
had
any
and
have
wrote
all
he
had
to
write
as
well
as
not
for
my
own
part
as
heaven
is
my
judge
and
to
which
i
shall
ever
make
my
last
appeal
i
know
no
more
of
calais
except
the
little
my
barber
told
me
of
it
as
he
was
whetting
his
razor
than
i
do
this
moment
of
grand
cairo
for
it
was
dusky
in
the
evening
when
i
landed
and
dark
as
pitch
in
the
morning
when
i
set
out
and
yet
by
merely
knowing
what
is
what
and
by
drawing
this
from
that
in
one
part
of
the
town
and
by
spelling
and
putting
this
and
that
together
in
another
i
would
lay
any
travelling
odds
that
i
this
moment
write
a
chapter
upon
calais
as
long
as
my
arm
and
with
so
distinct
and
satisfactory
a
detail
of
every
item
which
is
worth
a
stranger
curiosity
in
the
town
that
you
would
take
me
for
the
of
calais
itself
and
where
sir
would
be
the
wonder
was
not
democritus
who
laughed
ten
times
more
than
i
of
abdera
and
was
not
i
forget
his
name
who
had
more
discretion
than
us
both
of
ephesus
it
should
be
moreover
sir
with
so
much
knowledge
and
good
sense
and
truth
and
precision
nay
if
you
do
believe
me
you
may
read
the
chapter
for
your
pains
chapter
calais
calatium
calusium
calesium
this
town
if
we
may
trust
its
archives
the
authority
of
which
i
see
no
reason
to
call
in
question
in
this
place
was
once
no
more
than
a
small
village
belonging
to
one
of
the
first
counts
de
guignes
and
as
it
boasts
at
present
of
no
less
than
fourteen
thousand
inhabitants
exclusive
of
four
hundred
and
twenty
distinct
families
in
the
basse
ville
or
suburbs
it
must
have
grown
up
by
little
and
little
i
suppose
to
its
present
size
though
there
are
four
convents
there
is
but
one
parochial
church
in
the
whole
town
i
had
not
an
opportunity
of
taking
its
exact
dimensions
but
it
is
pretty
easy
to
make
a
tolerable
conjecture
of
for
as
there
are
fourteen
thousand
inhabitants
in
the
town
if
the
church
holds
them
all
it
must
be
considerably
large
and
if
it
will
not
is
a
very
great
pity
they
have
not
another
it
is
built
in
form
of
a
cross
and
dedicated
to
the
virgin
mary
the
steeple
which
has
a
spire
to
it
is
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
church
and
stands
upon
four
pillars
elegant
and
light
enough
but
sufficiently
strong
at
the
same
time
it
is
decorated
with
eleven
altars
most
of
which
are
rather
fine
than
beautiful
the
great
altar
is
a
in
its
kind
is
of
white
marble
and
as
i
was
told
near
sixty
feet
high
had
it
been
much
higher
it
had
been
as
high
as
mount
calvary
itself
therefore
i
suppose
it
must
be
high
enough
in
all
conscience
there
was
nothing
struck
me
more
than
the
great
square
tho
i
can
not
say
is
either
well
paved
or
well
built
but
is
in
the
heart
of
the
town
and
most
of
the
streets
especially
those
in
that
quarter
all
terminate
in
it
could
there
have
been
a
fountain
in
all
calais
which
it
seems
there
can
not
as
such
an
object
would
have
been
a
great
ornament
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
but
that
the
inhabitants
would
have
had
it
in
the
very
centre
of
this
square
not
that
it
is
properly
a
square
because
is
forty
feet
longer
from
east
to
west
than
from
north
to
south
so
that
the
french
in
general
have
more
reason
on
their
side
in
calling
them
places
than
squares
which
strictly
speaking
to
be
sure
they
are
not
the
seems
to
be
but
a
sorry
building
and
not
to
be
kept
in
the
best
repair
otherwise
it
had
been
a
second
great
ornament
to
this
place
it
answers
however
its
destination
and
serves
very
well
for
the
reception
of
the
magistrates
who
assemble
in
it
from
time
to
time
so
that
is
presumable
justice
is
regularly
distributed
i
have
heard
much
of
it
but
there
is
nothing
at
all
curious
in
the
courgain
is
a
distinct
quarter
of
the
town
inhabited
solely
by
sailors
and
fishermen
it
consists
of
a
number
of
small
streets
neatly
built
and
mostly
of
brick
is
extremely
populous
but
as
that
may
be
accounted
for
from
the
principles
of
their
diet
there
is
nothing
curious
in
that
a
traveller
may
see
it
to
satisfy
himself
he
must
not
omit
however
taking
notice
of
la
tour
de
guet
upon
any
account
is
so
called
from
its
particular
destination
because
in
war
it
serves
to
discover
and
give
notice
of
the
enemies
which
approach
the
place
either
by
sea
or
land
but
is
monstrous
high
and
catches
the
eye
so
continually
you
can
not
avoid
taking
notice
of
it
if
you
would
it
was
a
singular
disappointment
to
me
that
i
could
not
have
permission
to
take
an
exact
survey
of
the
fortifications
which
are
the
strongest
in
the
world
and
which
from
first
to
last
that
is
for
the
time
they
were
set
about
by
philip
of
france
count
of
bologne
to
the
present
war
wherein
many
reparations
were
made
have
cost
as
i
learned
afterwards
from
an
engineer
in
gascony
above
a
hundred
millions
of
livres
it
is
very
remarkable
that
at
the
tete
de
gravelenes
and
where
the
town
is
naturally
the
weakest
they
have
expended
the
most
money
so
that
the
outworks
stretch
a
great
way
into
the
campaign
and
consequently
occupy
a
large
tract
of
ground
however
after
all
that
is
said
and
done
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
calais
was
never
upon
any
account
so
considerable
from
itself
as
from
its
situation
and
that
easy
entrance
which
it
gave
our
ancestors
upon
all
occasions
into
france
it
was
not
without
its
inconveniences
also
being
no
less
troublesome
to
the
english
in
those
times
than
dunkirk
has
been
to
us
in
ours
so
that
it
was
deservedly
looked
upon
as
the
key
to
both
kingdoms
which
no
doubt
is
the
reason
that
there
have
arisen
so
many
contentions
who
should
keep
it
of
these
the
siege
of
calais
or
rather
the
blockade
for
it
was
shut
up
both
by
land
and
sea
was
the
most
memorable
as
it
the
efforts
of
edward
the
third
a
whole
year
and
was
not
terminated
at
last
but
by
famine
and
extreme
misery
the
gallantry
of
eustace
de
pierre
who
first
offered
himself
a
victim
for
his
has
rank
his
name
with
heroes
as
it
will
not
take
up
above
fifty
pages
it
would
be
injustice
to
the
reader
not
to
give
him
a
minute
account
of
that
romantic
transaction
as
well
as
of
the
siege
itself
in
rapin
own
words
chapter
but
courage
gentle
reader
i
scorn
it
is
enough
to
have
thee
in
my
power
but
to
make
use
of
the
advantage
which
the
fortune
of
the
pen
has
now
gained
over
thee
would
be
too
much
no
by
that
fire
which
warms
the
visionary
brain
and
lights
the
spirits
through
unworldly
tracts
ere
i
would
force
a
helpless
creature
upon
this
hard
service
and
make
thee
pay
poor
soul
for
fifty
pages
which
i
have
no
right
to
sell
thee
naked
as
i
am
i
would
browse
upon
the
mountains
and
smile
that
the
north
wind
brought
me
neither
my
tent
or
my
supper
so
put
on
my
brave
boy
and
make
the
best
of
thy
way
to
boulogne
chapter
boulogne
hah
so
we
are
all
got
together
debtors
and
sinners
before
heaven
a
jolly
set
of
us
but
i
ca
stay
and
quaff
it
off
with
you
i
pursued
myself
like
a
hundred
devils
and
shall
be
overtaken
before

can
well
change
horses

heaven
sake
make
haste
is
for
quoth
a
very
little
man
whispering
as
low
as
he
could
to
a
very
tall
man
that
stood
next
him
or
else
for
murder
quoth
the
tall
man
well
thrown
quoth
i
no
quoth
a
third
the
gentleman
has
been
committing
ah
ma
chere
fille
said
i
as
she
tripp
by
from
her
matins
you
look
as
rosy
as
the
morning
for
the
sun
was
rising
and
it
made
the
compliment
the
more
gracious
no
it
ca
be
that
quoth
a
fourth
she
made
a
to
me
i
kiss
my
hand
is

continued
he
is
certainly
for
debt
quoth
a
fifth
i
would
not
pay
that
gentleman

for
a
thousand
pounds
nor
would
i
quoth
size
for
six
times
the
sum
well
thrown

quoth
i
but
i
have
no
debt
but
the
debt
of
nature
and
i
want
but
patience
of
her
and
i
will
pay
her
every
farthing
i
owe
her
how
can
you
be
so
madam
to
arrest
a
poor
traveller
going
along
without
molestation
to
any
one
upon
his
lawful
occasions
do
stop
that
scoundrel
of
a
who
is
posting
after
me
he
never
would
have
followed
me
but
for
you
if
it
be
but
for
a
stage
or
two
just
to
give
me
start
of
him
i
beseech
you
madam
do
dear
lady
now
in
troth
is
a
great
pity
quoth
mine
irish
host
that
all
this
good
courtship
should
be
lost
for
the
young
gentlewoman
has
been
after
going
out
of
hearing
of
it
all
simpleton
quoth
i
so
you
have
nothing
else
in
boulogne
worth
seeing
by
jasus
there
is
the
finest
seminary
for
the
humanities
there
can
not
be
a
finer
quoth
i
chapter
when
the
precipitancy
of
a
man
wishes
hurries
on
his
ideas
ninety
times
faster
than
the
vehicle
he
rides
in
woe
be
to
truth
and
woe
be
to
the
vehicle
and
its
tackling
let
be
made
of
what
stuff
you
will
upon
which
he
breathes
forth
the
disappointment
of
his
soul
as
i
never
give
general
characters
either
of
men
or
things
in
choler
most
haste
the
worse
speed
was
all
the
reflection
i
made
upon
the
affair
the
first
time
it
happen
the
second
third
fourth
and
fifth
time
i
confined
it
respectively
to
those
times
and
accordingly
blamed
only
the
second
third
fourth
and
fifth
for
it
without
carrying
my
reflections
further
but
the
event
continuing
to
befal
me
from
the
fifth
to
the
sixth
seventh
eighth
ninth
and
tenth
time
and
without
one
exception
i
then
could
not
avoid
making
a
national
reflection
of
it
which
i
do
in
these
words
that
something
is
always
wrong
in
a
french
upon
first
setting
out
or
the
proposition
may
stand
thus
a
french
postilion
has
always
to
alight
before
he
has
got
three
hundred
yards
out
of
town
what
wrong
now
diable
a
rope
broke
a
knot
has
slipt
a
staple
drawn
a
bolt
to
whittle
a
tag
a
rag
a
jag
a
strap
a
buckle
or
a
buckle
tongue
want
altering
now
true
as
all
this
is
i
never
think
myself
impowered
to
excommunicate
thereupon
either
the
or
its
driver
nor
do
i
take
it
into
my
head
to
swear
by
the
living
i
would
rather
go
ten
thousand
times
or
that
i
will
be
damn
if
ever
i
get
into
another
but
i
take
the
matter
coolly
before
me
and
consider
that
some
tag
or
rag
or
jag
or
bolt
or
buckle
or
buckle
tongue
will
ever
be
a
wanting
or
want
altering
travel
where
i
will
so
i
never
chaff
but
take
the
good
and
the
bad
as
they
fall
in
my
road
and
get
on
do
so
my
lad
said
i
he
had
lost
five
minutes
already
in
alighting
in
order
to
get
at
a
luncheon
of
black
bread
which
he
had
cramm
into
the
and
was
remounted
and
going
leisurely
on
to
relish
it
the
get
on
my
lad
said
i
briskly
but
in
the
most
persuasive
tone
imaginable
for
i
jingled
a
sous
piece
against
the
glass
taking
care
to
hold
the
flat
side
towards
him
as
he
look
back
the
dog
grinn
intelligence
from
his
right
ear
to
his
left
and
behind
his
sooty
muzzle
discovered
such
a
pearly
row
of
teeth
that
sovereignty
would
have
pawn
her
jewels
for
them
just
heaven
what
masticators
bread
and
so
as
he
finished
the
last
mouthful
of
it
we
entered
the
town
of
montreuil
chapter
there
is
not
a
town
in
all
france
which
in
my
opinion
looks
better
in
the
map
than
montreuil
i
own
it
does
not
look
so
well
in
the
book
of
but
when
you
come
to
see
it
to
be
sure
it
looks
most
pitifully
there
is
one
thing
however
in
it
at
present
very
handsome
and
that
is
the
daughter
she
has
been
eighteen
months
at
amiens
and
six
at
paris
in
going
through
her
classes
so
knits
and
sews
and
dances
and
does
the
little
coquetries
very
a
slut
in
running
them
over
within
these
five
minutes
that
i
have
stood
looking
at
her
she
has
let
fall
at
least
a
dozen
loops
in
a
white
thread
stocking
yes
yes
i
see
you
cunning
gipsy
is
long
and
taper
you
need
not
pin
it
to
your
knee
and
that
is
your
own
and
fits
you
that
nature
should
have
told
this
creature
a
word
about
a
thumb
but
as
this
sample
is
worth
all
their
thumbs
besides
i
have
her
thumbs
and
fingers
in
at
the
bargain
if
they
can
be
any
guide
to
me
and
as
janatone
withal
for
that
is
her
name
stands
so
well
for
a
drawing
may
i
never
draw
more
or
rather
may
i
draw
like
a
by
main
strength
all
the
days
of
my
life
if
i
do
not
draw
her
in
all
her
proportions
and
with
as
determined
a
pencil
as
if
i
had
her
in
the
wettest
but
your
worships
chuse
rather
that
i
give
you
the
length
breadth
and
perpendicular
height
of
the
great
or
drawing
of
the
facade
of
the
abbey
of
saint
austreberte
which
has
been
transported
from
artois
hither
every
thing
is
just
i
suppose
as
the
masons
and
carpenters
left
them
and
if
the
belief
in
christ
continues
so
long
will
be
so
these
fifty
years
to
come
so
your
worships
and
reverences
may
all
measure
them
at
your
leisures
but
he
who
measures
thee
janatone
must
do
it
now
thou
carriest
the
principles
of
change
within
thy
frame
and
considering
the
chances
of
a
transitory
life
i
would
not
answer
for
thee
a
moment
ere
twice
twelve
months
are
passed
and
gone
thou
mayest
grow
out
like
a
pumpkin
and
lose
thy
shapes
or
thou
mayest
go
off
like
a
flower
and
lose
thy
beauty
nay
thou
mayest
go
off
like
a
hussy
and
lose
i
would
not
answer
for
my
aunt
dinah
was
she
alive
scarce
for
her
picture
were
it
but
painted
by
reynolds
but
if
i
go
on
with
my
drawing
after
naming
that
son
of
apollo
i
be
shot
so
you
must
be
content
with
the
original
which
if
the
evening
is
fine
in
passing
thro
montreuil
you
will
see
at
your
as
you
change
horses
but
unless
you
have
as
bad
a
reason
for
haste
as
i
have
you
had
better
stop
she
has
a
little
of
the
devote
but
that
sir
is
a
terce
to
a
nine
in
your
favour
help
me
i
could
not
count
a
single
point
so
had
been
piqued
and
repiqued
and
capotted
to
the
devil
chapter
all
which
being
considered
and
that
death
moreover
might
be
much
nearer
me
than
i
imagined
i
wish
i
was
at
abbeville
quoth
i
were
it
only
to
see
how
they
card
and
spin
so
off
we
set
vid
book
of

a

but
the
carders
and
spinners
were
all
gone
to
bed
chapter
what
a
vast
advantage
is
travelling
only
it
heats
one
but
there
is
a
remedy
for
that
which
you
may
pick
out
of
the
next
chapter
chapter
was
i
in
a
condition
to
stipulate
with
death
as
i
am
this
moment
with
my
apothecary
how
and
where
i
will
take
his
clyster
i
should
certainly
declare
against
submitting
to
it
before
my
friends
and
therefore
i
never
seriously
think
upon
the
mode
and
manner
of
this
great
catastrophe
which
generally
takes
up
and
torments
my
thoughts
as
much
as
the
catastrophe
itself
but
i
constantly
draw
the
curtain
across
it
with
this
wish
that
the
disposer
of
all
things
may
so
order
it
that
it
happen
not
to
me
in
my
own
house
but
rather
in
some
decent
inn
at
home
i
know
it
the
concern
of
my
friends
and
the
last
services
of
wiping
my
brows
and
smoothing
my
pillow
which
the
quivering
hand
of
pale
affection
shall
pay
me
will
so
crucify
my
soul
that
i
shall
die
of
a
distemper
which
my
physician
is
not
aware
of
but
in
an
inn
the
few
cold
offices
i
wanted
would
be
purchased
with
a
few
guineas
and
paid
me
with
an
undisturbed
but
punctual
attention
but
mark
this
inn
should
not
be
the
inn
at
abbeville
if
there
was
not
another
inn
in
the
universe
i
would
strike
that
inn
out
of
the
capitulation
so
let
the
horses
be
in
the
chaise
exactly
by
four
in
the
morning
yes
by
four
sir
or
by
genevieve
i
raise
a
clatter
in
the
house
shall
wake
the
dead
chapter
them
like
unto
a
wheel
is
a
bitter
sarcasm
as
all
the
learned
know
against
the
grand
tour
and
that
restless
spirit
for
making
it
which
david
prophetically
foresaw
would
haunt
the
children
of
men
in
the
latter
days
and
therefore
as
thinketh
the
great
bishop
hall
is
one
of
the
severest
imprecations
which
david
ever
utter
against
the
enemies
of
the
lord
and
as
if
he
had
said
wish
them
no
worse
luck
than
always
to
be
rolling
about
so
much
motion
continues
he
for
he
was
very
corpulent
is
so
much
unquietness
and
so
much
of
rest
by
the
same
analogy
is
so
much
of
heaven
now
i
being
very
thin
think
differently
and
that
so
much
of
motion
is
so
much
of
life
and
so
much
of
joy
and
that
to
stand
still
or
get
on
but
slowly
is
death
and
the
devil
hollo
ho
the
whole
world
asleep
bring
out
the
horses
grease
the
wheels
tie
on
the
mail
and
drive
a
nail
into
that
moulding
i
not
lose
a
moment
now
the
wheel
we
are
talking
of
and
whereinto
but
not
whereonto
for
that
would
make
an
ixion
wheel
of
it
he
curseth
his
enemies
according
to
the
bishop
habit
of
body
should
certainly
be
a
wheel
whether
they
were
set
up
in
palestine
at
that
time
or
not
and
my
wheel
for
the
contrary
reasons
must
as
certainly
be
a
groaning
round
its
revolution
once
in
an
age
and
of
which
sort
were
i
to
turn
commentator
i
should
make
no
scruple
to
affirm
they
had
great
store
in
that
hilly
country
i
love
the
pythagoreans
much
more
than
ever
i
dare
tell
my
dear
jenny
for
their
greek
their
out
of
the
body
in
order
to
think
well
no
man
thinks
right
whilst
he
is
in
it
blinded
as
he
must
be
with
his
congenial
humours
and
drawn
differently
aside
as
the
bishop
and
myself
have
been
with
too
lax
or
too
tense
a
fibre
reason
is
half
of
it
sense
and
the
measure
of
heaven
itself
is
but
the
measure
of
our
present
appetites
and
but
which
of
the
two
in
the
present
case
do
you
think
to
be
mostly
in
the
wrong
you
certainly
quoth
she
to
disturb
a
whole
family
so
early
chapter
but
she
did
not
know
i
was
under
a
vow
not
to
shave
my
beard
till
i
got
to
paris
yet
i
hate
to
make
mysteries
of
nothing
is
the
cold
cautiousness
of
one
of
those
little
souls
from
which
lessius
lib
de
moribus
divinis
cap
hath
made
his
estimate
wherein
he
setteth
forth
that
one
dutch
mile
cubically
multiplied
will
allow
room
enough
and
to
spare
for
eight
hundred
thousand
millions
which
he
supposes
to
be
as
great
a
number
of
souls
counting
from
the
fall
of
adam
as
can
possibly
be
damn
to
the
end
of
the
world
from
what
he
has
made
this
second
estimate
unless
from
the
parental
goodness
of
god
i
do
know
i
am
much
more
at
a
loss
what
could
be
in
franciscus
ribbera
head
who
pretends
that
no
less
a
space
than
one
of
two
hundred
italian
miles
multiplied
into
itself
will
be
sufficient
to
hold
the
like
number
he
certainly
must
have
gone
upon
some
of
the
old
roman
souls
of
which
he
had
read
without
reflecting
how
much
by
a
gradual
and
most
tabid
decline
in
the
course
of
eighteen
hundred
years
they
must
unavoidably
have
shrunk
so
as
to
have
come
when
he
wrote
almost
to
nothing
in
lessius
time
who
seems
the
cooler
man
they
were
as
little
as
can
be
imagined
we
find
them
less
now
and
next
winter
we
shall
find
them
less
again
so
that
if
we
go
on
from
little
to
less
and
from
less
to
nothing
i
hesitate
not
one
moment
to
affirm
that
in
half
a
century
at
this
rate
we
shall
have
no
souls
at
all
which
being
the
period
beyond
which
i
doubt
likewise
of
the
existence
of
the
christian
faith
be
one
advantage
that
both
of
will
be
exactly
worn
out
together
blessed
jupiter
and
blessed
every
other
heathen
god
and
goddess
for
now
ye
will
all
come
into
play
again
and
with
priapus
at
your
tails
what
jovial
times
but
where
am
i
and
into
what
a
delicious
riot
of
things
am
i
rushing
i
i
who
must
be
cut
short
in
the
midst
of
my
days
and
taste
no
more
of
than
what
i
borrow
from
my
imagination
peace
to
thee
generous
fool
and
let
me
go
on
chapter
hating
i
say
to
make
mysteries
of
nothing
i
intrusted
it
with
the
as
soon
as
ever
i
got
off
the
stones
he
gave
a
crack
with
his
whip
to
balance
the
compliment
and
with
the
trotting
and
a
sort
of
an
up
and
a
down
of
the
other
we
danced
it
along
to
ailly
au
clochers
famed
in
days
of
yore
for
the
finest
chimes
in
the
world
but
we
danced
through
it
without
music
the
chimes
being
greatly
out
of
order
as
in
truth
they
were
through
all
france
and
so
making
all
possible
speed
from
ailly
au
clochers
i
got
to
hixcourt
from
hixcourt
i
got
to
pequignay
and
from
pequignay
i
got
to
amiens
concerning
which
town
i
have
nothing
to
inform
you
but
what
i
have
informed
you
once
before
and
that
was
that
janatone
went
there
to
school
chapter
in
the
whole
catalogue
of
those
whiffling
vexations
which
come
puffing
across
a
man
canvass
there
is
not
one
of
a
more
teasing
and
tormenting
nature
than
this
particular
one
which
i
am
going
to
describe
and
for
which
unless
you
travel
with
an
which
numbers
do
in
order
to
prevent
it
there
is
no
help
and
it
is
this
that
be
you
in
never
so
kindly
a
propensity
to
sleep
though
you
are
passing
perhaps
through
the
finest
country
upon
the
best
roads
and
in
the
easiest
carriage
for
doing
it
in
the
world
nay
was
you
sure
you
could
sleep
fifty
miles
straight
forwards
without
once
opening
your
eyes
nay
what
is
more
was
you
as
demonstratively
satisfied
as
you
can
be
of
any
truth
in
euclid
that
you
should
upon
all
accounts
be
full
as
well
asleep
as
awake
nay
perhaps
better
yet
the
incessant
returns
of
paying
for
the
horses
at
every
stage
with
the
necessity
thereupon
of
putting
your
hand
into
your
pocket
and
counting
out
from
thence
three
livres
fifteen
sous
sous
by
sous
puts
an
end
to
so
much
of
the
project
that
you
can
not
execute
above
six
miles
of
it
or
supposing
it
is
a
post
and
a
half
that
is
but
nine
were
it
to
save
your
soul
from
destruction
i
be
even
with
quoth
i
for
i
put
the
precise
sum
into
a
piece
of
paper
and
hold
it
ready
in
my
hand
all
the
way
i
shall
have
nothing
to
do
said
i
composing
myself
to
rest
to
drop
this
gently
into
the
hat
and
not
say
a
word
then
there
wants
two
sous
more
to
drink
or
there
is
a
twelve
sous
piece
of
louis
xiv
which
will
not
pass
or
a
livre
and
some
odd
liards
to
be
brought
over
from
the
last
stage
which
monsieur
had
forgot
which
altercations
as
a
man
can
not
dispute
very
well
asleep
rouse
him
still
is
sweet
sleep
retrievable
and
still
might
the
flesh
weigh
down
the
spirit
and
recover
itself
of
these
blows
but
then
by
heaven
you
have
paid
but
for
a
single
post
whereas
is
a
post
and
a
half
and
this
obliges
you
to
pull
out
your
book
of
the
print
of
which
is
so
very
small
it
forces
you
to
open
your
eyes
whether
you
will
or
no
then
monsieur
le
cure
offers
you
a
pinch
of
snuff
or
a
poor
soldier
shews
you
his
leg
or
a
shaveling
his
box
or
the
priestesse
of
the
cistern
will
water
your
wheels
they
do
not
want
it
but
she
swears
by
her
priesthood
throwing
it
back
that
they
do
then
you
have
all
these
points
to
argue
or
consider
over
in
your
mind
in
doing
of
which
the
rational
powers
get
so
thoroughly
awakened
you
may
get
to
sleep
again
as
you
can
it
was
entirely
owing
to
one
of
these
misfortunes
or
i
had
pass
clean
by
the
stables
of
chantilly
but
the
postillion
first
affirming
and
then
persisting
in
it
to
my
face
that
there
was
no
mark
upon
the
two
sous
piece
i
open
my
eyes
to
be
convinced
and
seeing
the
mark
upon
it
as
plain
as
my
nose
i
leap
out
of
the
chaise
in
a
passion
and
so
saw
every
thing
at
chantilly
in
i
tried
it
but
for
three
posts
and
a
half
but
believe
is
the
best
principle
in
the
world
to
travel
speedily
upon
for
as
few
objects
look
very
inviting
in
that
mood
you
have
little
or
nothing
to
stop
you
by
which
means
it
was
that
i
passed
through
dennis
without
turning
my
head
so
much
as
on
one
side
towards
the
abby
richness
of
their
treasury
stuff
and
nonsense
bating
their
jewels
which
are
all
false
i
would
not
give
three
sous
for
any
one
thing
in
it
but
jaidas
lantern
nor
for
that
either
only
as
it
grows
dark
it
might
be
of
use
chapter
crack
crack
crack
crack
crack
crack
so
this
is
paris
quoth
i
continuing
in
the
same
mood
and
this
is
paris
humph
paris
cried
i
repeating
the
name
the
third
time
the
first
the
finest
the
most
brilliant
the
streets
however
are
nasty
but
it
looks
i
suppose
better
than
it
smells
crack
crack
crack
crack
what
a
fuss
thou
makest
as
if
it
concerned
the
good
people
to
be
informed
that
a
man
with
pale
face
and
clad
in
black
had
the
honour
to
be
driven
into
paris
at
nine
at
night
by
a
postillion
in
a
tawny
yellow
jerkin
turned
up
with
red
calamanco
crack
crack
crack
crack
crack
crack
i
wish
thy
whip
but
is
the
spirit
of
thy
nation
so
crack
crack
on
ha
and
no
one
gives
the
wall
but
in
the
school
of
urbanity
herself
if
the
walls
are
how
can
you
do
otherwise
and
prithee
when
do
they
light
the
lamps
what
never
in
the
summer
months
ho
is
the
time
of
o
rare
sallad
and
soup
soup
and
sallad
sallad
and
soup
encore
is
too
much
for
sinners
now
i
can
not
bear
the
barbarity
of
it
how
can
that
unconscionable
coachman
talk
so
much
bawdy
to
that
lean
horse
do
you
see
friend
the
streets
are
so
villanously
narrow
that
there
is
not
room
in
all
paris
to
turn
a
wheelbarrow
in
the
grandest
city
of
the
whole
world
it
would
not
have
been
amiss
if
they
had
been
left
a
thought
wider
nay
were
it
only
so
much
in
every
single
street
as
that
a
man
might
know
was
it
only
for
satisfaction
on
which
side
of
it
he
was
walking
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
nine
ten
cooks
shops
and
twice
the
number
of
barbers
and
all
within
three
minutes
driving
one
would
think
that
all
the
cooks
in
the
world
on
some
great
with
the
barbers
by
joint
consent
had
said
come
let
us
all
go
live
at
paris
the
french
love
good
eating
they
are
all
gourmands
we
shall
rank
high
if
their
god
is
their
belly
their
cooks
must
be
gentlemen
and
forasmuch
as
the
periwig
maketh
the
man
and
the
maketh
the
periwig
ergo
would
the
barbers
say
we
shall
rank
higher
still
we
shall
be
above
you
all
we
shall
be
capitouls
chief
magistrate
in
toulouse
at
least
pardi
we
shall
all
wear
swords
and
so
one
would
swear
that
is
by
but
there
is
no
depending
upon
it
they
continued
to
do
to
this
day
chapter
the
french
are
certainly
misunderstood
but
whether
the
fault
is
theirs
in
not
sufficiently
explaining
themselves
or
speaking
with
that
exact
limitation
and
precision
which
one
would
expect
on
a
point
of
such
importance
and
which
moreover
is
so
likely
to
be
contested
by
us
or
whether
the
fault
may
not
be
altogether
on
our
side
in
not
understanding
their
language
always
so
critically
as
to
know
they
would
be
at
i
shall
not
decide
but
is
evident
to
me
when
they
affirm
they
who
have
seen
paris
have
seen
every
thing
they
must
mean
to
speak
of
those
who
have
seen
it
by
as
for
i
give
it
up
i
have
said
before
there
was
no
depending
upon
it
and
i
repeat
it
again
but
not
because
the
lights
and
shades
are
too
sharp
or
the
tints
confounded
or
that
there
is
neither
beauty
or
keeping
c
that
not
truth
but
it
is
an
uncertain
light
in
this
respect
that
in
all
the
five
hundred
grand
hotels
which
they
number
up
to
you
in
paris
and
the
five
hundred
good
things
at
a
modest
computation
for
is
only
allowing
one
good
thing
to
a
hotel
which
by
are
best
to
be
seen
felt
heard
and
understood
which
by
the
bye
is
a
quotation
from
lilly
the
devil
a
one
of
us
out
of
fifty
can
get
our
heads
fairly
thrust
in
amongst
them
this
is
no
part
of
the
french
computation
is
simply
this
that
by
the
last
survey
taken
in
the
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
sixteen
since
which
time
there
have
been
considerable
augmentations
paris
doth
contain
nine
hundred
streets
viz
in
the
quarter
called
the
city
there
are
streets
in
james
of
the
shambles
streets
in

in

of

luxembourg
streets
and
in
that
of
germain
streets
into
any
of
which
you
may
walk
and
that
when
you
have
seen
them
with
all
that
belongs
to
them
fairly
by
their
gates
their
bridges
their
squares
their
statues
and
have
crusaded
it
moreover
through
all
their
by
no
means
omitting
roche
and
sulpice
and
to
crown
all
have
taken
a
walk
to
the
four
palaces
which
you
may
see
either
with
or
without
the
statues
and
pictures
just
as
you
chuse
then
you
will
have
seen
but
is
what
no
one
needeth
to
tell
you

you
will
read
of
it
yourself
upon
the

no

the
french
have
a
gay
way
of
treating
every
thing
that
is
great
and
that
is
all
can
be
said
upon
it
chapter
in
mentioning
the
word
gay
as
in
the
close
of
the
last
chapter
it
puts
one
an
author
in
mind
of
the
word
spleen
especially
if
he
has
any
thing
to
say
upon
it
not
that
by
any
analysis
or
that
from
any
table
of
interest
or
genealogy
there
appears
much
more
ground
of
alliance
betwixt
them
than
betwixt
light
and
darkness
or
any
two
of
the
most
unfriendly
opposites
in
nature
only
is
an
undercraft
of
authors
to
keep
up
a
good
understanding
amongst
words
as
politicians
do
amongst
men
not
knowing
how
near
they
may
be
under
a
necessity
of
placing
them
to
each
other
which
point
being
now
gain
and
that
i
may
place
mine
exactly
to
my
mind
i
write
it
down
here
spleen
this
upon
leaving
chantilly
i
declared
to
be
the
best
principle
in
the
world
to
travel
speedily
upon
but
i
gave
it
only
as
matter
of
opinion
i
still
continue
in
the
same
sentiments
only
i
had
not
then
experience
enough
of
its
working
to
add
this
that
though
you
do
get
on
at
a
tearing
rate
yet
you
get
on
but
uneasily
to
yourself
at
the
same
time
for
which
reason
i
here
quit
it
entirely
and
for
ever
and
is
heartily
at
any
one
service
it
has
spoiled
me
the
digestion
of
a
good
supper
and
brought
on
a
bilious
diarrhoea
which
has
brought
me
back
again
to
my
first
principle
on
which
i
set
out
and
with
which
i
shall
now
scamper
it
away
to
the
banks
of
the
garonne
no
i
can
not
stop
a
moment
to
give
you
the

of
the

their
genius
their
manners
their
customs
their
laws
their
religion
their
government
their
manufactures
their
commerce
their
finances
with
all
the
resources
and
hidden
springs
which
sustain
them
qualified
as
i
may
be
by
spending
three
days
and
two
nights
amongst
them
and
during
all
that
time
making
these
things
the
entire
subject
of
my
enquiries

in

my
opinion
of
lord
is
neither
better
nor
worse
than
it
was
of
honours
like
impressions

that
made
me
think
of
offering
up
half

amusement
to
mr

out

operates
more
forcibly
at

as
half

amusement

be
more

refreshing
after

sorrow
than
after

nothing
is
so
perfectly
amusement
as
a
total
change
of
ideas
no
ideas
are
so
totally
different
as
those
of
ministers
and
innocent
lovers
for
which
reason
when
i
come
to
talk
of
statesmen
and
patriots
and
set
such
marks
upon
them
as
will
prevent
confusion
and
mistakes
concerning
them
for
the
future
i
propose
to
dedicate
that
volume
to
some
gentle
shepherd
whose
thoughts
proud
science
never
taught
to
stray
far
as
the
statesman
walk
or
yet
simple
nature
to
his
hopes
had
given
out
of
a
head
a
humbler
heaven
some
untam
world
in
depths
of
wood
embraced
some
happier
island
in
the
and
where
admitted
to
that
equal
sky
his
faithful
dogs
should
bear
him
company
in
a
word
by
thus
introducing
an
entire
new
set
of
objects
to
his
imagination
i
shall
unavoidably
give
a
diversion
to
his
passionate
and
contemplations
in
the
mean
time
i
am
the
author
chapter
now
i
hate
to
hear
a
person
especially
if
he
be
a
traveller
complain
that
we
do
not
get
on
so
fast
in
france
as
we
do
in
england
whereas
we
get
on
much
faster
consideratis
considerandis
thereby
always
meaning
that
if
you
weigh
their
vehicles
with
the
mountains
of
baggage
which
you
lay
both
before
and
behind
upon
them
and
then
consider
their
puny
horses
with
the
very
little
they
give
them
is
a
wonder
they
get
on
at
all
their
suffering
is
most
unchristian
and
is
evident
thereupon
to
me
that
a
french
would
not
know
what
in
the
world
to
do
was
it
not
for
the
two
words
and
in
which
there
is
as
much
sustenance
as
if
you
give
him
a
peck
of
corn
now
as
these
words
cost
nothing
i
long
from
my
soul
to
tell
the
reader
what
they
are
but
here
is
the
question
they
must
be
told
him
plainly
and
with
the
most
distinct
articulation
or
it
will
answer
no
end
and
yet
to
do
it
in
that
plain
way
though
their
reverences
may
laugh
at
it
in
the
full
well
i
wot
they
will
abuse
it
in
the
parlour
for
which
cause
i
have
been
volving
and
revolving
in
my
fancy
some
time
but
to
no
purpose
by
what
clean
device
or
facette
contrivance
i
might
so
modulate
them
that
whilst
i
satisfy
that
ear
which
the
reader
chuses
to
lend
me
i
might
not
dissatisfy
the
other
which
he
keeps
to
himself
my
ink
burns
my
finger
to
try
and
when
i
have
have
a
worse
consequence
it
will
burn
i
fear
my
paper
no
i
dare
not
but
if
you
wish
to
know
how
the
abbess
of
andouillets
and
a
novice
of
her
convent
got
over
the
difficulty
only
first
wishing
myself
all
imaginable
success
i
tell
you
without
the
least
scruple
chapter
the
abbess
of
andouillets
which
if
you
look
into
the
large
set
of
provincial
maps
now
publishing
at
paris
you
will
find
situated
amongst
the
hills
which
divide
burgundy
from
savoy
being
in
danger
of
an
anchylosis
or
stiff
joint
the
sinovia
of
her
knee
becoming
hard
by
long
matins
and
having
tried
every
remedy
first
prayers
and
thanksgiving
then
invocations
to
all
the
saints
in
heaven
promiscuously
then
particularly
to
every
saint
who
had
ever
had
a
stiff
leg
before
her
then
touching
it
with
all
the
reliques
of
the
convent
principally
with
the
of
the
man
of
lystra
who
had
been
impotent
from
his
youth
then
wrapping
it
up
in
her
veil
when
she
went
to
bed
then
her
rosary
then
bringing
in
to
her
aid
the
secular
arm
and
anointing
it
with
oils
and
hot
fat
of
animals
then
treating
it
with
emollient
and
resolving
fomentations
then
with
poultices
of
mallows
bonus
henricus
white
lillies
and
fenugreek
then
taking
the
woods
i
mean
the
smoak
of
holding
her
scapulary
across
her
lap
then
decoctions
of
wild
chicory
chervil
sweet
cecily
and
cochlearia
and
nothing
all
this
while
answering
was
prevailed
on
at
last
to
try
the
of
bourbon
so
having
first
obtained
leave
of
the
to
take
care
of
her
existence
she
ordered
all
to
be
got
ready
for
her
journey
a
novice
of
the
convent
of
about
seventeen
who
had
been
troubled
with
a
whitloe
in
her
middle
finger
by
sticking
it
constantly
into
the
abbess
cast
poultices
had
gained
such
an
interest
that
overlooking
a
sciatical
old
nun
who
might
have
been
set
up
for
ever
by
the
of
bourbon
margarita
the
little
novice
was
elected
as
the
companion
of
the
journey
an
old
calesh
belonging
to
the
abbesse
lined
with
green
frize
was
ordered
to
be
drawn
out
into
the
sun
the
gardener
of
the
convent
being
chosen
muleteer
led
out
the
two
old
mules
to
clip
the
hair
from
the
of
their
tails
whilst
a
couple
of
were
busied
the
one
in
darning
the
lining
and
the
other
in
sewing
on
the
shreds
of
yellow
binding
which
the
teeth
of
time
had
unravelled
the
dress
the
muleteer
hat
in
hot
and
a
taylor
sat
musically
at
it
in
a
shed
the
convent
in
assorting
four
dozen
of
bells
for
the
harness
whistling
to
each
bell
as
he
tied
it
on
with
a
the
carpenter
and
the
smith
of
andouillets
held
a
council
of
wheels
and
by
seven
the
morning
after
all
look
spruce
and
was
ready
at
the
gate
of
the
convent
for
the
of
bourbon
two
rows
of
the
unfortunate
stood
ready
there
an
hour
before
the
abbess
of
andouillets
supported
by
margarita
the
novice
advanced
slowly
to
the
calesh
both
clad
in
white
with
their
black
rosaries
hanging
at
their
breasts
there
was
a
simple
solemnity
in
the
contrast
they
entered
the
calesh
the
nuns
in
the
same
uniform
sweet
emblem
of
innocence
each
occupied
a
window
and
as
the
abbess
and
margarita
look
up
each
the
sciatical
poor
nun
excepted
each
stream
out
the
end
of
her
veil
in
the
air
then
kiss
the
lilly
hand
which
let
it
go
the
good
abbess
and
margarita
laid
their
hands
upon
their
breasts
look
up
to
heaven
then
to
them
and
look
bless
you
dear
sisters
i
declare
i
am
interested
in
this
story
and
wish
i
had
been
there
the
gardener
whom
i
shall
now
call
the
muleteer
was
a
little
hearty
chattering
toping
kind
of
a
fellow
who
troubled
his
head
very
little
with
the
hows
and
whens
of
life
so
had
mortgaged
a
month
of
his
conventical
wages
in
a
borrachio
or
leathern
cask
of
wine
which
he
had
disposed
behind
the
calesh
with
a
large
over
it
to
guard
it
from
the
sun
and
as
the
weather
was
hot
and
he
not
a
niggard
of
his
labours
walking
ten
times
more
than
he
rode
he
found
more
occasions
than
those
of
nature
to
fall
back
to
the
rear
of
his
carriage
till
by
frequent
coming
and
going
it
had
so
happen
that
all
his
wine
had
leak
out
at
the
legal
vent
of
the
borrachio
before
one
half
of
the
journey
was
finish
man
is
a
creature
born
to
habitudes
the
day
had
been
sultry
the
evening
was
delicious
the
wine
was
generous
the
burgundian
hill
on
which
it
grew
was
steep
a
little
tempting
bush
over
the
door
of
a
cool
cottage
at
the
foot
of
it
hung
vibrating
in
full
harmony
with
the
passions
a
gentle
air
rustled
distinctly
through
the
leaves
come
thirsty
muleteer
come
in
the
muleteer
was
a
son
of
adam
i
need
not
say
a
word
more
he
gave
the
mules
each
of
a
sound
lash
and
looking
in
the
abbess
and
margarita
faces
as
he
did
it
as
much
as
to
say
i
am
he
gave
a
second
good
crack
as
much
as
to
say
to
his
mules
on
so
slinking
behind
he
enter
the
little
inn
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
muleteer
as
i
told
you
was
a
little
joyous
chirping
fellow
who
thought
not
of
nor
of
what
had
gone
before
or
what
was
to
follow
it
provided
he
got
but
his
scantling
of
burgundy
and
a
little
along
with
it
so
entering
into
a
long
conversation
as
how
he
was
chief
gardener
to
the
convent
of
andouillets
and
out
of
friendship
for
the
abbess
and
mademoiselle
margarita
who
was
only
in
her
noviciate
he
had
come
along
with
them
from
the
confines
of
savoy
and
as
how
she
had
got
a
white
swelling
by
her
devotions
and
what
a
nation
of
herbs
he
had
procured
to
mollify
her
humours
and
that
if
the
waters
of
bourbon
did
not
mend
that
leg
she
might
as
well
be
lame
of
both
he
so
contrived
his
story
as
absolutely
to
forget
the
heroine
of
it
and
with
her
the
little
novice
and
what
was
a
more
ticklish
point
to
be
forgot
than
both
the
two
mules
who
being
creatures
that
take
advantage
of
the
world
inasmuch
as
their
parents
took
it
of
them
and
they
not
being
in
a
condition
to
return
the
obligation
downwards
as
men
and
women
and
beasts
are
they
do
it
and
and
and
up
hill
and
down
hill
and
which
way
they
philosophers
with
all
their
ethicks
have
never
considered
this
rightly
how
should
the
poor
muleteer
then
in
his
cups
consider
it
at
all
he
did
not
in
the
least
is
time
we
do
let
us
leave
him
then
in
the
vortex
of
his
element
the
happiest
and
most
thoughtless
of
mortal
men
and
for
a
moment
let
us
look
after
the
mules
the
abbess
and
margarita
by
virtue
of
the
muleteer
two
last
strokes
the
mules
had
gone
quietly
on
following
their
own
consciences
up
the
hill
till
they
had
about
one
half
of
it
when
the
elder
of
them
a
shrewd
crafty
old
devil
at
the
turn
of
an
angle
giving
a
side
glance
and
no
muleteer
behind
them
by
my
fig
said
she
swearing
i
go
no
further
and
if
i
do
replied
the
other
they
shall
make
a
drum
of
my
and
so
with

consent

stopp

forgetting
the
o

by
this
wicked
stiff
joint
why
did
i

why
didst

not

to

unpolluted
to

tomb

the
novice
catching

at

any
where

chapter
my
dear
mother
quoth
the
novice
coming
a
little
to
herself
there
are
two
certain
words
which
i
have
been
told
will
force
any
horse
or
ass
or
mule
to
go
up
a
hill
whether
he
will
or
no
be
he
never
so
obstinate
or
the
moment
he
hears
them
utter
he
obeys
they
are
words
magic
cried
the
abbess
in
the
utmost
horror
no
replied
margarita
calmly
but
they
are
words
sinful
what
are
they
quoth
the
abbess
interrupting
her
they
are
sinful
in
the
first
degree
answered
margarita
they
are
mortal
and
if
we
are
ravished
and
die
unabsolved
of
them
we
shall
you
may
pronounce
them
to
me
quoth
the
abbess
of
andouillets
they
can
not
my
dear
mother
said
the
novice
be
pronounced
at
all
they
will
make
all
the
blood
in
one
body
fly
up
into
one
face
but
you
may
whisper
them
in
my
ear
quoth
the
abbess
heaven
hadst
thou
no
guardian
angel
to
delegate
to
the
inn
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
was
there
no
generous
and
friendly
spirit
unemployed
no
agent
in
nature
by
some
monitory
shivering
creeping
along
the
artery
which
led
to
his
heart
to
rouse
the
muleteer
from
his
banquet
no
sweet
minstrelsy
to
bring
back
the
fair
idea
of
the
abbess
and
margarita
with
their
black
rosaries
rouse

but
is
too
late
the
horrid
words
are
pronounced
this
moment
and
how
to
tell
them

who
can

of
every
thing
existing

quoth
the
abbess
turning
casuist
in
the
distress
they
were
under

held
by
the
confessor
of
our
convent
to
be
either
mortal
or
venial
there
is
no
further
division
now
a
venial
sin
being
the
slightest
and

of
all

being
halved
by
taking
either
only
the
half
of
it
and
leaving
the
rest
or
by
taking
it
all
and
amicably
halving
it
betwixt
yourself
and
another

diluted

no

why
is
a
strange
story
tristram
alas
madam
had
it
been
upon
some
melancholy
lecture
of
the
cross
the
peace
of
meekness
or
the
contentment
of
resignation
i
had
not
been
incommoded
or
had
i
thought
of
writing
it
upon
the
purer
abstractions
of
the
soul
and
that
food
of
wisdom
and
holiness
and
contemplation
upon
which
the
spirit
of
man
when
separated
from
the
body
is
to
subsist
for
ever
you
would
have
come
with
a
better
appetite
from
it
i
wish
i
never
had
wrote
it
but
as
i
never
blot
any
thing
out
let
us
use
some
honest
means
to
get
it
out
of
our
heads
directly
pray
reach
me
my
fool
cap
i
fear
you
sit
upon
it
madam
is
under
the
cushion
i
put
it
on
bless
me
you
have
had
it
upon
your
head
this
half
there
then
let
it
stay
with
a
diddle
di
and
a
diddle
d
and
a
fiddle
and
now
madam
we
may
venture
i
hope
a
little
to
go
on
chapter
all
you
need
say
of
fontainbleau
in
case
you
are
ask
is
that
it
stands
about
forty
miles
south
something
from
paris
in
the
middle
of
a
large
forest
that
there
is
something
great
in
it
that
the
king
goes
there
once
every
two
or
three
years
with
his
whole
court
for
the
pleasure
of
the
chace
and
that
during
that
carnival
of
sporting
any
english
gentleman
of
fashion
you
need
not
forget
yourself
may
be
accommodated
with
a
nag
or
two
to
partake
of
the
sport
taking
care
only
not
to
the
king
though
there
are
two
reasons
why
you
need
not
talk
loud
of
this
to
every
one
first
because
make
the
said
nags
the
harder
to
be
got
and
secondly
is
not
a
word
of
it
allons
as
for
sens
you
may
dispatch
in
a
word
an
archiepiscopal
see
for
joigny
the
less
i
think
one
says
of
it
the
better
but
for
auxerre
i
could
go
on
for
ever
for
in
my
grand
tour
through
europe
in
which
after
all
my
father
not
caring
to
trust
me
with
any
one
attended
me
himself
with
my
uncle
toby
and
trim
and
obadiah
and
indeed
most
of
the
family
except
my
mother
who
being
taken
up
with
a
project
of
knitting
my
father
a
pair
of
large
worsted
breeches
the
thing
is
common
sense
and
she
not
caring
to
be
put
out
of
her
way
she
staid
at
home
at
shandy
hall
to
keep
things
right
during
the
expedition
in
which
i
say
my
father
stopping
us
two
days
at
auxerre
and
his
researches
being
ever
of
such
a
nature
that
they
would
have
found
fruit
even
in
a
desert
he
has
left
me
enough
to
say
upon
auxerre
in
short
wherever
my
father
went
but
was
more
remarkably
so
in
this
journey
through
france
and
italy
than
in
any
other
stages
of
his
life
his
road
seemed
to
lie
so
much
on
one
side
of
that
wherein
all
other
travellers
have
gone
before
him
he
saw
kings
and
courts
and
silks
of
all
colours
in
such
strange
lights
and
his
remarks
and
reasonings
upon
the
characters
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
countries
we
over
were
so
opposite
to
those
of
all
other
mortal
men
particularly
those
of
my
uncle
toby
and
trim
to
say
nothing
of
myself
and
to
crown
all
the
occurrences
and
scrapes
which
we
were
perpetually
meeting
and
getting
into
in
consequence
of
his
systems
and
opiniotry
they
were
of
so
odd
so
mix
and
a
contexture
that
the
whole
put
together
it
appears
of
so
different
a
shade
and
tint
from
any
tour
of
europe
which
was
ever
executed
that
i
will
venture
to
pronounce
the
fault
must
be
mine
and
mine
only
if
it
be
not
read
by
all
travellers
and
till
travelling
is
no
more
or
which
comes
to
the
same
point
till
the
world
finally
takes
it
into
its
head
to
stand
but
this
rich
bale
is
not
to
be
open
now
except
a
small
thread
or
two
of
it
merely
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
my
father
stay
at
auxerre
as
i
have
mentioned
it
is
too
slight
to
be
kept
suspended
and
when
wove
in
there
is
an
end
of
it
we
go
brother
toby
said
my
father
whilst
dinner
is
coddling
to
the
abbey
of
saint
germain
if
it
be
only
to
see
these
bodies
of
which
monsieur
sequier
has
given
such
a
i
go
see
any
body
quoth
my
uncle
toby
for
he
was
all
compliance
through
every
step
of
the
journey
defend
me
said
my
father
they
are
all
mummies
then
one
need
not
shave
quoth
my
uncle
toby
shave
no
cried
my
father
be
more
like
relations
to
go
with
our
beards
on
so
out
we
sallied
the
corporal
lending
his
master
his
arm
and
bringing
up
the
rear
to
the
abbey
of
saint
germain
every
thing
is
very
fine
and
very
rich
and
very
superb
and
very
magnificent
said
my
father
addressing
himself
to
the
sacristan
who
was
a
younger
brother
of
the
order
of
benedictines
but
our
curiosity
has
led
us
to
see
the
bodies
of
which
monsieur
sequier
has
given
the
world
so
exact
a
the
sacristan
made
a
bow
and
lighting
a
torch
first
which
he
had
always
in
the
vestry
ready
for
the
purpose
he
led
us
into
the
tomb
of
heribald
this
said
the
sacristan
laying
his
hand
upon
the
tomb
was
a
renowned
prince
of
the
house
of
bavaria
who
under
the
successive
reigns
of
charlemagne
louis
le
debonnair
and
charles
the
bald
bore
a
great
sway
in
the
government
and
had
a
principal
hand
in
bringing
every
thing
into
order
and
discipline
then
he
has
been
as
great
said
my
uncle
in
the
field
as
in
the
cabinet
i
dare
say
he
has
been
a
gallant
soldier
he
was
a
monk
said
the
sacristan
my
uncle
toby
and
trim
sought
comfort
in
each
other
faces
but
found
it
not
my
father
clapped
both
his
hands
upon
his
which
was
a
way
he
had
when
any
thing
hugely
tickled
him
for
though
he
hated
a
monk
and
the
very
smell
of
a
monk
worse
than
all
the
devils
in
hell
yet
the
shot
hitting
my
uncle
toby
and
trim
so
much
harder
than
him
was
a
relative
triumph
and
put
him
into
the
gayest
humour
in
the
world
and
pray
what
do
you
call
this
gentleman
quoth
my
father
rather
sportingly
this
tomb
said
the
young
benedictine
looking
downwards
contains
the
bones
of
saint
maxima
who
came
from
ravenna
on
purpose
to
touch
the
body
of
saint
maximus
said
my
father
popping
in
with
his
saint
before
him
they
were
two
of
the
greatest
saints
in
the
whole
martyrology
added
my
father
excuse
me
said
the
sacristan
was
to
touch
the
bones
of
saint
germain
the
builder
of
the
abbey
and
what
did
she
get
by
it
said
my
uncle
toby
what
does
any
woman
get
by
it
said
my
father
martyrdome
replied
the
young
benedictine
making
a
bow
down
to
the
ground
and
uttering
the
word
with
so
humble
but
decisive
a
cadence
it
disarmed
my
father
for
a
moment
is
supposed
continued
the
benedictine
that
maxima
has
lain
in
this
tomb
four
hundred
years
and
two
hundred
before
her
canonization
is
but
a
slow
rise
brother
toby
quoth
my
father
in
this
army
of
a
desperate
slow
one
an
please
your
honour
said
trim
unless
one
could
purchase
i
should
rather
sell
out
entirely
quoth
my
uncle
toby
i
am
pretty
much
of
your
opinion
brother
toby
said
my
father
poor
maxima
said
my
uncle
toby
low
to
himself
as
we
turn
from
her
tomb
she
was
one
of
the
fairest
and
most
beautiful
ladies
either
of
italy
or
france
continued
the
sacristan
but
who
the
duce
has
got
lain
down
here
besides
her
quoth
my
father
pointing
with
his
cane
to
a
large
tomb
as
we
walked
on
it
is
saint
optat
sir
answered
the
sacristan
and
properly
is
saint
optat
plac
said
my
father
and
what
is
saint
optat
story
continued
he
saint
optat
replied
the
sacristan
was
a
bishop
i
thought
so
by
heaven
cried
my
father
interrupting
him
saint
optat
how
should
saint
optat
fail
so
snatching
out
his
and
the
young
benedictine
holding
him
the
torch
as
he
wrote
he
set
it
down
as
a
new
prop
to
his
system
of
christian
names
and
i
will
be
bold
to
say
so
disinterested
was
he
in
the
search
of
truth
that
had
he
found
a
treasure
in
saint
optat
tomb
it
would
not
have
made
him
half
so
rich
was
as
successful
a
short
visit
as
ever
was
paid
to
the
dead
and
so
highly
was
his
fancy
pleas
with
all
that
had
passed
in
it
that
he
determined
at
once
to
stay
another
day
in
auxerre
i
see
the
rest
of
these
good
gentry
said
my
father
as
we
cross
over
the
square
and
while
you
are
paying
that
visit
brother
shandy
quoth
my
uncle
toby
the
corporal
and
i
will
mount
the
ramparts
chapter
now
this
is
the
most
puzzled
skein
of
all
for
in
this
last
chapter
as
far
at
least
as
it
has
help
me
through
auxerre
i
have
been
getting
forwards
in
two
different
journies
together
and
with
the
same
dash
of
the
pen
for
i
have
got
entirely
out
of
auxerre
in
this
journey
which
i
am
writing
now
and
i
am
got
half
way
out
of
auxerre
in
that
which
i
shall
write
hereafter
there
is
but
a
certain
degree
of
perfection
in
every
thing
and
by
pushing
at
something
beyond
that
i
have
brought
myself
into
such
a
situation
as
no
traveller
ever
stood
before
me
for
i
am
this
moment
walking
across
the
of
auxerre
with
my
father
and
my
uncle
toby
in
our
way
back
to
dinner
and
i
am
this
moment
also
entering
lyons
with
my
broke
into
a
thousand
pieces
and
i
am
moreover
this
moment
in
a
handsome
pavillion
built
by
pringello
the
same
don
pringello
the
celebrated
spanish
architect
of
whom
my
cousin
antony
has
made
such
honourable
mention
in
a
scholium
to
the
tale
inscribed
to
his
name
vid
small
edit
upon
the
banks
of
the
garonne
which
mons
sligniac
has
lent
me
and
where
i
now
sit
rhapsodising
all
these
affairs
let
me
collect
myself
and
pursue
my
journey
chapter
i
am
glad
of
it
said
i
settling
the
account
with
myself
as
i
into
lyons
my
chaise
being
all
laid
with
my
baggage
in
a
cart
which
was
moving
slowly
before
me
i
am
heartily
glad
said
i
that
is
all
broke
to
pieces
for
now
i
can
go
directly
by
water
to
avignon
which
will
carry
me
on
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
of
my
journey
and
not
cost
me
seven
livres
and
from
thence
continued
i
bringing
forwards
the
account
i
can
hire
a
couple
of
mules
or
asses
if
i
like
for
nobody
knows
me
and
cross
the
plains
of
languedoc
for
almost
nothing
i
shall
gain
four
hundred
livres
by
the
misfortune
clear
into
my
purse
and
pleasure
worth
worth
double
the
money
by
it
with
what
velocity
continued
i
clapping
my
two
hands
together
shall
i
fly
down
the
rapid
rhone
with
the
vivares
on
my
right
hand
and
dauphiny
on
my
left
scarce
seeing
the
ancient
cities
of
vienne
valence
and
vivieres
what
a
flame
will
it
rekindle
in
the
lamp
to
snatch
a
blushing
grape
from
the
hermitage
and
cote
roti
as
i
shoot
by
the
foot
of
them
and
what
a
fresh
spring
in
the
blood
to
behold
upon
the
banks
advancing
and
retiring
the
castles
of
romance
whence
courteous
knights
have
whilome
rescued
the
distress
and
see
vertiginous
the
rocks
the
mountains
the
cataracts
and
all
the
hurry
which
nature
is
in
with
all
her
great
works
about
her
as
i
went
on
thus
methought
my
chaise
the
wreck
of
which
stately
enough
at
the
first
insensibly
grew
less
and
less
in
its
size
the
freshness
of
the
painting
was
no
more
the
gilding
lost
its
lustre
and
the
whole
affair
appeared
so
poor
in
my
eyes
so
sorry
so
contemptible
and
in
a
word
so
much
worse
than
the
abbess
of
andouillets
itself
that
i
was
just
opening
my
mouth
to
give
it
to
the
devil
when
a
pert
vamping
stepping
nimbly
across
the
street
demanded
if
monsieur
would
have
his
chaise
refitted
no
no
said
i
shaking
my
head
sideways
would
monsieur
choose
to
sell
it
rejoined
the
undertaker
with
all
my
soul
said
i
the
iron
work
is
worth
forty
livres
and
the
glasses
worth
forty
more
and
the
leather
you
may
take
to
live
on
what
a
mine
of
wealth
quoth
i
as
he
counted
me
the
money
has
this
brought
me
in
and
this
is
my
usual
method
of
at
least
with
the
disasters
of
life
making
a
penny
of
every
one
of
as
they
happen
to
me
do
my
dear
jenny
tell
the
world
for
me
how
i
behaved
under
one
the
most
oppressive
of
its
kind
which
could
befal
me
as
a
man
proud
as
he
ought
to
be
of
his
manhood
enough
saidst
thou
coming
close
up
to
me
as
i
stood
with
my
garters
in
my
hand
reflecting
upon
what
had
not
pass
is
enough
tristram
and
i
am
satisfied
saidst
thou
whispering
these
words
in
my
ear
any
other
man
would
have
sunk
down
to
the
centre
every
thing
is
good
for
something
quoth
i
i
go
into
wales
for
six
weeks
and
drink
goat
whey
and
gain
seven
years
longer
life
for
the
accident
for
which
reason
i
think
myself
inexcusable
for
blaming
fortune
so
often
as
i
have
done
for
pelting
me
all
my
life
long
like
an
ungracious
duchess
as
i
her
with
so
many
small
evils
surely
if
i
have
any
cause
to
be
angry
with
her
is
that
she
has
not
sent
me
great
ones
a
score
of
good
cursed
bouncing
losses
would
have
been
as
good
as
a
pension
to
me
one
of
a
hundred
a
year
or
so
is
all
i
wish
i
would
not
be
at
the
plague
of
paying
for
a
larger
chapter
to
those
who
call
vexations
vexations
as
knowing
what
they
are
there
could
not
be
a
greater
than
to
be
the
best
part
of
a
day
at
lyons
the
most
opulent
and
flourishing
city
in
france
enriched
with
the
most
fragments
of
antiquity
and
not
be
able
to
see
it
to
be
withheld
upon
any
account
must
be
a
vexation
but
to
be
withheld
by
a
vexation
must
certainly
be
what
philosophy
justly
calls
vexation
upon
vexation
i
had
got
my
two
dishes
of
milk
coffee
which
by
the
bye
is
excellently
good
for
a
consumption
but
you
must
boil
the
milk
and
coffee
together
otherwise
is
only
coffee
and
milk
and
as
it
was
no
more
than
eight
in
the
morning
and
the
boat
did
not
go
off
till
noon
i
had
time
to
see
enough
of
lyons
to
tire
the
patience
of
all
the
friends
i
had
in
the
world
with
it
i
will
take
a
walk
to
the
cathedral
said
i
looking
at
my
list
and
see
the
wonderful
mechanism
of
this
great
clock
of
lippius
of
basil
in
the
first
place
now
of
all
things
in
the
world
i
understand
the
least
of
mechanism
i
have
neither
genius
or
taste
or
fancy
and
have
a
brain
so
entirely
unapt
for
every
thing
of
that
kind
that
i
solemnly
declare
i
was
never
yet
able
to
comprehend
the
principles
of
motion
of
a
squirrel
cage
or
a
common
wheel
tho
i
have
many
an
hour
of
my
life
up
with
great
devotion
at
the
one
and
stood
by
with
as
much
patience
as
any
christian
ever
could
do
at
the
other
i
go
see
the
surprising
movements
of
this
great
clock
said
i
the
very
first
thing
i
do
and
then
i
will
pay
a
visit
to
the
great
library
of
the
jesuits
and
procure
if
possible
a
sight
of
the
thirty
volumes
of
the
general
history
of
china
wrote
not
in
the
tartarean
but
in
the
chinese
language
and
in
the
chinese
character
too
now
i
almost
know
as
little
of
the
chinese
language
as
i
do
of
the
mechanism
of
lippius
so
why
these
should
have
jostled
themselves
into
the
two
first
articles
of
my
list
i
leave
to
the
curious
as
a
problem
of
nature
i
own
it
looks
like
one
of
her
ladyship
obliquities
and
they
who
court
her
are
interested
in
finding
out
her
humour
as
much
as
i
when
these
curiosities
are
seen
quoth
i
half
addressing
myself
to
my
valet
de
place
who
stood
behind
me
be
no
hurt
if
we
go
to
the
church
of
irenaeus
and
see
the
pillar
to
which
christ
was
tied
and
after
that
the
house
where
pontius
pilate
lived
was
at
the
next
town
said
the
valet
de
place
at
vienne
i
am
glad
of
it
said
i
rising
briskly
from
my
chair
and
walking
across
the
room
with
strides
twice
as
long
as
my
usual
pace
so
much
the
sooner
shall
i
be
at
the
tomb
of
the
two
lovers
what
was
the
cause
of
this
movement
and
why
i
took
such
long
strides
in
uttering
this
i
might
leave
to
the
curious
too
but
as
no
principle
of
is
concerned
in
it
be
as
well
for
the
reader
if
i
explain
it
myself
chapter
o
there
is
a
sweet
aera
in
the
life
of
man
when
the
brain
being
tender
and
fibrillous
and
more
like
pap
than
any
thing
else
a
story
read
of
two
fond
lovers
separated
from
each
other
by
cruel
parents
and
by
still
more
cruel
destiny
amandus
he
amanda
she
each
ignorant
of
the
other
course
he
east
she
west
amandus
taken
captive
by
the
turks
and
carried
to
the
emperor
of
morocco
court
where
the
princess
of
morocco
falling
in
love
with
him
keeps
him
twenty
years
in
prison
for
the
love
of
his
she
amanda
all
the
time
wandering
barefoot
and
with
hair
rocks
and
mountains
enquiring
for
amandus
amandus
amandus
making
every
hill
and
valley
to
echo
back
his
name
amandus
amandus
at
every
town
and
city
sitting
down
forlorn
at
the
gate
has
amandus
has
my
amandus
enter
till
going
round
and
round
and
round
the
world
chance
unexpected
bringing
them
at
the
same
moment
of
the
night
though
by
different
ways
to
the
gate
of
lyons
their
native
city
and
each
in
accents
calling
out
aloud
is
amandus
is
my
amanda
still
alive
they
fly
into
each
other
arms
and
both
drop
down
dead
for
joy
there
is
a
soft
aera
in
every
gentle
mortal
life
where
such
a
story
affords
more
pabulum
to
the
brain
than
all
the
frusts
and
crusts
and
rusts
of
antiquity
which
travellers
can
cook
up
for
it
was
all
that
stuck
on
the
right
side
of
the
cullender
in
my
own
of
what
spon
and
others
in
their
accounts
of
lyons
had
strained
into
it
and
finding
moreover
in
some
itinerary
but
in
what
god
knows
that
sacred
to
the
fidelity
of
amandus
and
amanda
a
tomb
was
built
without
the
gates
where
to
this
hour
lovers
called
upon
them
to
attest
their
truths
i
never
could
get
into
a
scrape
of
that
kind
in
my
life
but
this
tomb
of
the
lovers
would
somehow
or
other
come
in
at
the
close
nay
such
a
kind
of
empire
had
it
establish
over
me
that
i
could
seldom
think
or
speak
of
lyons
and
sometimes
not
so
much
as
see
even
a
but
this
remnant
of
antiquity
would
present
itself
to
my
fancy
and
i
have
often
said
in
my
wild
way
of
running
on
tho
i
fear
with
some
irreverence
thought
this
shrine
neglected
as
it
was
as
valuable
as
that
of
mecca
and
so
little
short
except
in
wealth
of
the
santa
casa
itself
that
some
time
or
other
i
would
go
a
pilgrimage
though
i
had
no
other
business
at
lyons
on
purpose
to
pay
it
a
visit
in
my
list
therefore
of
videnda
at
lyons
this
tho
last
was
not
you
see
least
so
taking
a
dozen
or
two
of
longer
strides
than
usual
cross
my
room
just
whilst
it
passed
my
brain
i
walked
down
calmly
into
the
basse
cour
in
order
to
sally
forth
and
having
called
for
my
bill
as
it
was
uncertain
whether
i
should
return
to
my
inn
i
had
paid
it
had
moreover
given
the
maid
ten
sous
and
was
just
receiving
the
dernier
compliments
of
monsieur
le
blanc
for
a
pleasant
voyage
down
the
rhone
when
i
was
stopped
at
the
gate
chapter
was
by
a
poor
ass
who
had
just
turned
in
with
a
couple
of
large
panniers
upon
his
back
to
collect
eleemosynary
and
and
stood
dubious
with
his
two
on
the
inside
of
the
threshold
and
with
his
two
hinder
feet
towards
the
street
as
not
knowing
very
well
whether
he
was
to
go
in
or
no
now
is
an
animal
be
in
what
hurry
i
may
i
can
not
bear
to
strike
there
is
a
patient
endurance
of
sufferings
wrote
so
unaffectedly
in
his
looks
and
carriage
which
pleads
so
mightily
for
him
that
it
always
disarms
me
and
to
that
degree
that
i
do
not
like
to
speak
unkindly
to
him
on
the
contrary
meet
him
where
i
will
whether
in
town
or
country
in
cart
or
under
panniers
whether
in
liberty
or
bondage
i
have
ever
something
civil
to
say
to
him
on
my
part
and
as
one
word
begets
another
if
he
has
as
little
to
do
as
i
i
generally
fall
into
conversation
with
him
and
surely
never
is
my
imagination
so
busy
as
in
framing
his
responses
from
the
etchings
of
his
countenance
and
where
those
carry
me
not
deep
enough
in
flying
from
my
own
heart
into
his
and
seeing
what
is
natural
for
an
ass
to
think
as
well
as
a
man
upon
the
occasion
in
truth
it
is
the
only
creature
of
all
the
classes
of
beings
below
me
with
whom
i
can
do
this
for
parrots
jackdaws
i
never
exchange
a
word
with
them
nor
with
the
apes
for
pretty
near
the
same
reason
they
act
by
rote
as
the
others
speak
by
it
and
equally
make
me
silent
nay
my
dog
and
my
cat
though
i
value
them
both
and
for
my
dog
he
would
speak
if
he
could
yet
somehow
or
other
they
neither
of
them
possess
the
talents
for
conversation
i
can
make
nothing
of
a
discourse
with
them
beyond
the
proposition
the
reply
and
rejoinder
which
terminated
my
and
my
mother
conversations
in
his
beds
of
justice
and
those
utter
there
an
end
of
the
dialogue
but
with
an
ass
i
can
commune
for
ever
come
honesty
said
i
seeing
it
was
impracticable
to
pass
betwixt
him
and
the
gate
art
thou
for
coming
in
or
going
out
the
ass
twisted
his
head
round
to
look
up
the
street
well
replied
i
we
wait
a
minute
for
thy
driver
he
turned
his
head
thoughtful
about
and
looked
wistfully
the
opposite
way
i
understand
thee
perfectly
answered
i
if
thou
takest
a
wrong
step
in
this
affair
he
will
cudgel
thee
to
death
well
a
minute
is
but
a
minute
and
if
it
saves
a
a
drubbing
it
shall
not
be
set
down
as
he
was
eating
the
stem
of
an
artichoke
as
this
discourse
went
on
and
in
the
little
peevish
contentions
of
nature
betwixt
hunger
and
unsavouriness
had
dropt
it
out
of
his
mouth
half
a
dozen
times
and
pick
it
up
again
god
help
thee
jack
said
i
thou
hast
a
bitter
breakfast
o
and
many
a
bitter
day
labour
and
many
a
bitter
blow
i
fear
for
its
wages
is
all
all
bitterness
to
thee
whatever
life
is
to
and
now
thy
mouth
if
one
knew
the
truth
of
it
is
as
bitter
i
dare
say
as
soot
for
he
had
cast
aside
the
stem
and
thou
hast
not
a
friend
perhaps
in
all
this
world
that
will
give
thee
a
in
saying
this
i
pull
out
a
paper
of
which
i
had
just
purchased
and
gave
him
one
and
at
this
moment
that
i
am
telling
it
my
heart
smites
me
that
there
was
more
of
pleasantry
in
the
conceit
of
seeing
how
an
ass
would
eat
a
macaroon
than
of
benevolence
in
giving
him
one
which
presided
in
the
act
when
the
ass
had
eaten
his
macaroon
i
press
him
to
come
in
the
poor
beast
was
heavy
loaded
his
legs
seem
to
tremble
under
him
he
hung
rather
backwards
and
as
i
pull
at
his
halter
it
broke
short
in
my
hand
he
look
up
pensive
in
my
face
thrash
me
with
it
but
if
you
will
you
may
if
i
do
said
i
i
be
d
the
word
was
but
of
it
pronounced
like
the
abbess
of
andouillet
so
there
was
no
sin
in
it
when
a
person
coming
in
let
fall
a
thundering
bastinado
upon
the
poor
devil
crupper
which
put
an
end
to
the
ceremony
out
upon
it
cried
i
but
the
interjection
was
equivocal
and
i
think
wrong
placed
too
for
the
end
of
an
osier
which
had
started
out
from
the
contexture
of
the
ass
panier
had
caught
hold
of
my
breeches
pocket
as
he
rush
by
me
and
rent
it
in
the
most
disastrous
direction
you
can
imagine
so
that
the
out
upon
it
in
my
opinion
should
have
come
in
here
but
this
i
leave
to
be
settled
by
the
reviewers
of
my
breeches
which
i
have
brought
over
along
with
me
for
that
purpose
chapter
when
all
was
set
to
rights
i
came
down
stairs
again
into
the
basse
cour
with
my
valet
de
place
in
order
to
sally
out
towards
the
tomb
of
the
two
lovers
and
was
a
second
time
stopp
at
the
gate
not
by
the
ass
but
by
the
person
who
struck
him
and
who
by
that
time
had
taken
possession
as
is
not
uncommon
after
a
defeat
of
the
very
spot
of
ground
where
the
ass
stood
it
was
a
commissary
sent
to
me
from
the
with
a
rescript
in
his
hand
for
the
payment
of
some
six
livres
odd
sous
upon
what
account
said
is
upon
the
part
of
the
king
replied
the
commissary
heaving
up
both
his
shoulders
my
good
friend
quoth
i
as
sure
as
i
am
i
and
you
are
you
and
who
are
you
said
do
puzzle
me
said
i
chapter
but
it
is
an
indubitable
verity
continued
i
addressing
myself
to
the
commissary
changing
only
the
form
of
my
asseveration
that
i
owe
the
king
of
france
nothing
but
my
good
will
for
he
is
a
very
honest
man
and
i
wish
him
all
health
and
pastime
in
the
world
pardonnez
moi
replied
the
commissary
you
are
indebted
to
him
six
livres
four
sous
for
the
next
post
from
hence
to
fons
in
your
route
to
avignon
which
being
a
post
royal
you
pay
double
for
the
horses
and
postillion
otherwise
have
amounted
to
no
more
than
three
livres
two
sous
but
i
do
go
by
land
said
i
you
may
if
you
please
replied
the
commissary
your
most
obedient
servant
said
i
making
him
a
low
bow
the
commissary
with
all
the
sincerity
of
grave
good
breeding
made
me
one
as
low
i
never
was
more
disconcerted
with
a
bow
in
my
life
the
devil
take
the
serious
character
of
these
people
quoth
i
aside
they
understand
no
more
of
irony
than
this
the
comparison
was
standing
close
by
with
his
panniers
but
something
seal
up
my
lips
i
could
not
pronounce
the
name
sir
said
i
collecting
myself
it
is
not
my
intention
to
take
post
but
you
may
said
he
persisting
in
his
first
reply
you
may
take
post
if
you
chuse
and
i
may
take
salt
to
my
pickled
herring
said
i
if
i
chuse
but
i
do
not
chuse
but
you
must
pay
for
it
whether
you
do
or
no
aye
for
the
salt
said
i
i
know
and
for
the
post
too
added
he
defend
me
cried
i
i
travel
by
water
i
am
going
down
the
rhone
this
very
afternoon
my
baggage
is
in
the
boat
and
i
have
actually
paid
nine
livres
for
my
passage
tout
egal
is
all
one
said
he
bon
dieu
what
pay
for
the
way
i
go
and
for
the
way
i
do
not
go
tout
egal
replied
the
commissary
the
devil
it
is
said
i
but
i
will
go
to
ten
thousand
bastiles
first
o
england
england
thou
land
of
liberty
and
climate
of
good
sense
thou
tenderest
of
mothers
and
gentlest
of
nurses
cried
i
kneeling
upon
one
knee
as
i
was
beginning
my
apostrophe
when
the
director
of
madam
le
blanc
conscience
coming
in
at
that
instant
and
seeing
a
person
in
black
with
a
face
as
pale
as
ashes
at
his
devotions
looking
still
paler
by
the
contrast
and
distress
of
his
drapery
ask
if
i
stood
in
want
of
the
aids
of
the
church
i
go
by
water
said
i
and
here
another
will
be
for
making
me
pay
for
going
by
oil
chapter
as
i
perceived
the
commissary
of
the
would
have
his
six
livres
four
sous
i
had
nothing
else
for
it
but
to
say
some
smart
thing
upon
the
occasion
worth
the
money
and
so
i
set
off
thus
and
pray
commissary
by
what
law
of
courtesy
is
a
defenceless
stranger
to
be
used
just
the
reverse
from
what
you
use
a
frenchman
in
this
matter
by
no
means
said
he
excuse
me
said
i
for
you
have
begun
sir
with
first
tearing
off
my
now
you
want
my
pocket
whereas
had
you
first
taken
my
pocket
as
you
do
with
your
own
people
and
then
left
me
bare
after
i
had
been
a
beast
to
have
complain
as
it
is
is
contrary
to
the
law
of
nature
is
contrary
to
reason
is
contrary
to
the
gospel
but
not
to
this
said
he
putting
a
printed
paper
into
my
hand
par
le
roy
is
a
pithy
prolegomenon
quoth
i
and
so
read
on
by
all
which
it
appears
quoth
i
having
read
it
over
a
little
too
rapidly
that
if
a
man
sets
out
in
a
from
paris
he
must
go
on
travelling
in
one
all
the
days
of
his
life
or
pay
for
excuse
me
said
the
commissary
the
spirit
of
the
ordinance
is
this
that
if
you
set
out
with
an
intention
of
running
post
from
paris
to
avignon
you
shall
not
change
that
intention
or
mode
of
travelling
without
first
satisfying
the
fermiers
for
two
posts
further
than
the
place
you
repent
at
and
is
founded
continued
he
upon
this
that
the
revenues
are
not
to
fall
short
through
your
fickleness
o
by
heavens
cried
i
if
fickleness
is
taxable
in
france
we
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
make
the
best
peace
with
you
we
can
and
so
the
peace
was
made
and
if
it
is
a
bad
one
as
tristram
shandy
laid
the
of
it
nobody
but
tristram
shandy
ought
to
be
hanged
chapter
though
i
was
sensible
i
had
said
as
many
clever
things
to
the
commissary
as
came
to
six
livres
four
sous
yet
i
was
determined
to
note
down
the
imposition
amongst
my
remarks
before
i
retired
from
the
place
so
putting
my
hand
into
my
for
my
remarks
which
by
the
bye
may
be
a
caution
to
travellers
to
take
a
little
more
care
of
their
remarks
for
the
future
remarks
were
stolen
never
did
sorry
traveller
make
such
a
pother
and
racket
about
his
remarks
as
i
did
about
mine
upon
the

but

stolen
what
shall
i
do
mr

i
drop
any
remarks
as
i
stood
besides
you
you
dropp
a
good
many
very
singular
ones
replied
he
pugh
said
i
those
were
but
a
few
not
worth
above
six
livres
two
sous
but
these
are
a
large
parcel
he
shook
his
head
monsieur

you
see
any
papers
of
mine
you
maid
of
the
house
run
up
stairs
francois
run
up
after
her
i
must
have
my
remarks
they
were
the
best
remarks

i
that
ever
were
made
the
wisest

wittiest
what
shall
i
do
which
way
shall
i
turn

sancho

when
he
lost
his
ass
furniture
did
not
exclaim
more
bitterly
chapter
when
the
first
transport
was
over
and
the
registers
of
the
brain
were
beginning
to
get
a
little
out
of
the
confusion
into
which
this
jumble
of
cross
accidents
had
cast
them
it
then
presently
occurr
to
me
that
i
had
left
my
remarks
in
the
pocket
of
the
chaise
and
that
in
selling
my
chaise
i
had
sold
my
remarks
along
with
it
to
the
i
leave
this
void
space
that
the
reader
may
swear
into
it
any
oath
that
he
is
most
accustomed
to
for
my
own
part
if
ever
i
swore
a
whole
oath
into
a
vacancy
in
my
life
i
think
it
was
into
that
said
i
and
so
my
remarks
through
france
which
were
as
full
of
wit
as
an
egg
is
full
of
meat
and
as
well
worth
four
hundred
guineas
as
the
said
egg
is
worth
a
penny
have
i
been
selling
here
to
a
for
four
louis
and
giving
him
a
by
heaven
worth
six
into
the
bargain
had
it
been
to
dodsley
or
becket
or
any
creditable
bookseller
who
was
either
leaving
off
business
and
wanted
a
or
who
was
beginning
it
and
wanted
my
remarks
and
two
or
three
guineas
along
with
them
i
could
have
borne
it
but
to
a
shew
me
to
him
this
moment
francois
said
i
the
valet
de
place
put
on
his
hat
and
led
the
way
and
i
pull
off
mine
as
i
pass
the
commissary
and
followed
him
chapter
when
we
arrived
at
the
house
both
the
house
and
the
shop
were
shut
up
it
was
the
eighth
of
september
the
nativity
of
the
blessed
virgin
mary
mother
of
god
the
whole
world
was
gone
out
a
frisking
here
capering
there
no
body
cared
a
button
for
me
or
my
remarks
so
i
sat
me
down
upon
a
bench
by
the
door
philosophating
upon
my
condition
by
a
better
fate
than
usually
attends
me
i
had
not
waited
half
an
hour
when
the
mistress
came
in
to
take
the
papilliotes
from
off
her
hair
before
she
went
to
the
the
french
women
by
the
bye
love
a
la
folie
that
is
as
much
as
their
matins
give
but
a
whether
in
may
june
july
or
september
they
never
count
the
times
down
it
goes
is
meat
drink
washing
and
lodging
to
and
had
we
but
the
policy
please
your
worships
as
wood
is
a
little
scarce
in
france
to
send
them
but
plenty
of
the
women
would
set
them
up
and
when
they
had
done
they
would
dance
round
them
and
the
men
for
company
till
they
were
all
blind
the
wife
of
the
stepp
in
i
told
you
to
take
the
papilliotes
from
off
her
hair
the
toilet
stands
still
for
no
man
so
she
jerk
off
her
cap
to
begin
with
them
as
she
open
the
door
in
doing
which
one
of
them
fell
upon
the
ground
i
instantly
saw
it
was
my
own
writing
o
seigneur
cried
i
you
have
got
all
my
remarks
upon
your
head
madam
suis
bien
mortifiee
said
she
is
well
thinks
i
they
have
stuck
there
for
could
they
have
gone
deeper
they
would
have
made
such
confusion
in
a
french
woman
noddle
she
had
better
have
gone
with
it
unfrizled
to
the
day
of
eternity
tenez
said
she
so
without
any
idea
of
the
nature
of
my
suffering
she
took
them
from
her
curls
and
put
them
gravely
one
by
one
into
my
hat
one
was
twisted
this
way
another
twisted
that
ey
by
my
faith
and
when
they
are
published
quoth
i
they
will
be
worse
twisted
still
chapter
and
now
for
lippius
clock
said
i
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
got
thro
all
his
difficulties
nothing
can
prevent
us
seeing
that
and
the
chinese
history
except
the
time
said
francois
for
is
almost
eleven
then
we
must
speed
the
faster
said
i
striding
it
away
to
the
cathedral
i
can
not
say
in
my
heart
that
it
gave
me
any
concern
in
being
told
by
one
of
the
minor
canons
as
i
was
entering
the
west
door
that
lippius
great
clock
was
all
out
of
joints
and
had
not
gone
for
some
years
it
will
give
me
the
more
time
thought
i
to
peruse
the
chinese
history
and
besides
i
shall
be
able
to
give
the
world
a
better
account
of
the
clock
in
its
decay
than
i
could
have
done
in
its
flourishing
condition
and
so
away
i
posted
to
the
college
of
the
jesuits
now
it
is
with
the
project
of
getting
a
peep
at
the
history
of
china
in
chinese
characters
as
with
many
others
i
could
mention
which
strike
the
fancy
only
at
a
distance
for
as
i
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
point
my
blood
cool
the
freak
gradually
went
off
till
at
length
i
would
not
have
given
a
to
have
it
gratified
the
truth
was
my
time
was
short
and
my
heart
was
at
the
tomb
of
the
lovers
i
wish
to
god
said
i
as
i
got
the
rapper
in
my
hand
that
the
key
of
the
library
may
be
but
lost
it
fell
out
as
well
for
all
the
jesuits
had
got
the
cholic
and
to
that
degree
as
never
was
known
in
the
memory
of
the
oldest
practitioner
chapter
as
i
knew
the
geography
of
the
tomb
of
the
lovers
as
well
as
if
i
had
lived
twenty
years
in
lyons
namely
that
it
was
upon
the
turning
of
my
right
hand
just
without
the
gate
leading
to
the
fauxbourg
de
vaise
i
dispatched
francois
to
the
boat
that
i
might
pay
the
homage
i
so
long
ow
it
without
a
witness
of
my
weakness
i
walk
with
all
imaginable
joy
towards
the
place
when
i
saw
the
gate
which
intercepted
the
tomb
my
heart
glowed
within
me
tender
and
faithful
spirits
cried
i
addressing
myself
to
amandus
and
amanda
long
long
have
i
tarried
to
drop
this
tear
upon
your
tomb
i
come
i
come
when
i
came
there
was
no
tomb
to
drop
it
upon
what
would
i
have
given
for
my
uncle
toby
to
have
whistled
lillo
bullero
chapter
no
matter
how
or
in
what
mood
but
i
flew
from
the
tomb
of
the
lovers
or
rather
i
did
not
fly
from
it
for
there
was
no
such
thing
existing
and
just
got
time
enough
to
the
boat
to
save
my
passage
and
ere
i
had
sailed
a
hundred
yards
the
rhone
and
the
saon
met
together
and
carried
me
down
merrily
betwixt
them
but
i
have
described
this
voyage
down
the
rhone
before
i
made
it
so
now
i
am
at
avignon
and
as
there
is
nothing
to
see
but
the
old
house
in
which
the
duke
of
ormond
resided
and
nothing
to
stop
me
but
a
short
remark
upon
the
place
in
three
minutes
you
will
see
me
crossing
the
bridge
upon
a
mule
with
francois
upon
a
horse
with
my
portmanteau
behind
him
and
the
owner
of
both
striding
the
way
before
us
with
a
long
gun
upon
his
shoulder
and
a
sword
under
his
arm
lest
peradventure
we
should
run
away
with
his
cattle
had
you
seen
my
breeches
in
entering
avignon
though
you
have
seen
them
better
i
think
as
i
mounted
you
would
not
have
thought
the
precaution
amiss
or
found
in
your
heart
to
have
taken
it
in
dudgeon
for
my
own
part
i
took
it
most
kindly
and
determined
to
make
him
a
present
of
them
when
we
got
to
the
end
of
our
journey
for
the
trouble
they
had
put
him
to
of
arming
himself
at
all
points
against
them
before
i
go
further
let
me
get
rid
of
my
remark
upon
avignon
which
is
this
that
i
think
it
wrong
merely
because
a
man
hat
has
been
blown
off
his
head
by
chance
the
first
night
he
comes
to
avignon
that
he
should
therefore
say
is
more
subject
to
high
winds
than
any
town
in
all
france
for
which
reason
i
laid
no
stress
upon
the
accident
till
i
had
enquired
of
the
master
of
the
inn
about
it
who
telling
me
seriously
it
was
so
and
hearing
moreover
the
windiness
of
avignon
spoke
of
in
the
country
about
as
a
proverb
i
set
it
down
merely
to
ask
the
learned
what
can
be
the
cause
the
consequence
i
saw
for
they
are
all
dukes
marquisses
and
counts
there
the
duce
a
baron
in
all
avignon
so
that
there
is
scarce
any
talking
to
them
on
a
windy
day
prithee
friend
said
i
take
hold
of
my
mule
for
a
moment
for
i
wanted
to
pull
off
one
of
my
which
hurt
my
heel
the
man
was
standing
quite
idle
at
the
door
of
the
inn
and
as
i
had
taken
it
into
my
head
he
was
someway
concerned
about
the
house
or
stable
i
put
the
bridle
into
his
hand
so
begun
with
the
boot
when
i
had
finished
the
affair
i
turned
about
to
take
the
mule
from
the
man
and
thank
him
but
monsieur
le
marquis
had
walked
in
chapter
i
had
now
the
whole
south
of
france
from
the
banks
of
the
rhone
to
those
of
the
garonne
to
traverse
upon
my
mule
at
my
own
leisure
at
my
own
leisure
for
i
had
left
death
the
lord
knows
and
he
only
how
far
behind
me
have
followed
many
a
man
thro
france
quoth
he
but
never
at
this
mettlesome
rate
still
he
followed
and
still
i
fled
him
but
i
fled
him
cheerfully
still
he
pursued
but
like
one
who
pursued
his
prey
without
hope
as
he
lagg
every
step
he
lost
softened
his
looks
why
should
i
fly
him
at
this
rate
so
notwithstanding
all
the
commissary
of
the
had
said
i
changed
the
mode
of
my
travelling
once
more
and
after
so
precipitate
and
rattling
a
course
as
i
had
run
i
flattered
my
fancy
with
thinking
of
my
mule
and
that
i
should
traverse
the
rich
plains
of
languedoc
upon
his
back
as
slowly
as
foot
could
fall
there
is
nothing
more
pleasing
to
a
traveller
or
more
terrible
to
than
a
large
rich
plain
especially
if
it
is
without
great
rivers
or
bridges
and
presents
nothing
to
the
eye
but
one
unvaried
picture
of
plenty
for
after
they
have
once
told
you
that
delicious
or
delightful
as
the
case
happens
that
the
soil
was
grateful
and
that
nature
pours
out
all
her
abundance
c
they
have
then
a
large
plain
upon
their
hands
which
they
know
not
what
to
do
with
and
which
is
of
little
or
no
use
to
them
but
to
carry
them
to
some
town
and
that
town
perhaps
of
little
more
but
a
new
place
to
start
from
to
the
next
plain
and
so
on
this
is
most
terrible
work
judge
if
i
do
manage
my
plains
better
chapter
i
had
not
gone
above
two
leagues
and
a
half
before
the
man
with
his
gun
began
to
look
at
his
priming
i
had
three
several
times
loiter
terribly
behind
half
a
mile
at
least
every
time
once
in
deep
conference
with
a
who
was
making
drums
for
the
fairs
of
baucaira
and
tarascone
i
did
not
understand
the
principles
the
second
time
i
can
not
so
properly
say
i
stopp
for
meeting
a
couple
of
franciscans
straitened
more
for
time
than
myself
and
not
being
able
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
what
i
was
about
i
had
turn
back
with
them
the
third
was
an
affair
of
trade
with
a
gossip
for
a
of
provence
figs
for
four
sous
this
would
have
been
transacted
at
once
but
for
a
case
of
conscience
at
the
close
of
it
for
when
the
figs
were
paid
for
it
turn
out
that
there
were
two
dozen
of
eggs
covered
over
with
at
the
bottom
of
the
basket
as
i
had
no
intention
of
buying
eggs
i
made
no
sort
of
claim
of
them
as
for
the
space
they
had
occupied
what
signified
it
i
had
figs
enow
for
my
money
but
it
was
my
intention
to
have
the
basket
it
was
the
intention
to
keep
it
without
which
she
could
do
nothing
with
her
eggs
and
unless
i
had
the
basket
i
could
do
as
little
with
my
figs
which
were
too
ripe
already
and
most
of
burst
at
the
side
this
brought
on
a
short
contention
which
terminated
in
sundry
proposals
what
we
should
both
do
how
we
disposed
of
our
eggs
and
figs
i
defy
you
or
the
devil
himself
had
he
not
been
there
which
i
am
persuaded
he
was
to
form
the
least
probable
conjecture
you
will
read
the
whole
of
it
not
this
year
for
i
am
hastening
to
the
story
of
my
uncle
toby
amours
but
you
will
read
it
in
the
collection
of
those
which
have
arose
out
of
the
journey
across
this
plain
and
which
therefore
i
call
my
plain
stories
how
far
my
pen
has
been
fatigued
like
those
of
other
travellers
in
this
journey
of
it
over
so
barren
a
track
the
world
must
judge
but
the
traces
of
it
which
are
now
all
set
o
vibrating
together
this
moment
tell
me
is
the
most
fruitful
and
busy
period
of
my
life
for
as
i
had
made
no
convention
with
my
man
with
the
gun
as
to
time
by
stopping
and
talking
to
every
soul
i
met
who
was
not
in
a
full
trot
joining
all
parties
before
me
waiting
for
every
soul
behind
hailing
all
those
who
were
coming
through
arresting
all
kinds
of
beggars
pilgrims
fiddlers
friars
not
passing
by
a
woman
in
a
without
commending
her
legs
and
tempting
her
into
conversation
with
a
pinch
of
snuff
in
short
by
seizing
every
handle
of
what
size
or
shape
soever
which
chance
held
out
to
me
in
this
journey
i
turned
my
plain
into
a
city
i
was
always
in
company
and
with
great
variety
too
and
as
my
mule
loved
society
as
much
as
myself
and
had
some
proposals
always
on
his
part
to
offer
to
every
beast
he
met
i
am
confident
we
could
have
passed
through
or
for
a
month
together
with
fewer
adventures
and
seen
less
of
human
nature
o
there
is
that
sprightly
frankness
which
at
once
unpins
every
plait
of
a
languedocian
dress
that
whatever
is
beneath
it
it
looks
so
like
the
simplicity
which
poets
sing
of
in
better
days
i
will
delude
my
fancy
and
believe
it
is
so
was
in
the
road
betwixt
nismes
and
lunel
where
there
is
the
best
muscatto
wine
in
all
france
and
which
by
the
bye
belongs
to
the
honest
canons
of
montpellier
and
foul
befal
the
man
who
has
drunk
it
at
their
table
who
grudges
them
a
drop
of
it
the
sun
was
set
they
had
done
their
work
the
nymphs
had
tied
up
their
hair
afresh
and
the
swains
were
preparing
for
a
carousal
my
mule
made
a
dead
point
is
the
fife
and
tabourin
said
i
i
to
death
quoth
he
they
are
running
at
the
ring
of
pleasure
said
i
giving
him
a
prick
by
saint

making
the

resolution
with
the
abbesse
of
andouillets
i
not
go
a
step
further

very
well
sir
said
i
i
never
will
argue
a
point
with
one
of
your
family
as
long
as
i
live
so
leaping
off
his
back
and
kicking
off
one
boot
into
this
ditch
and
into
that
i
take
a
dance
said
i
so
stay
you
here
a
daughter
of
labour
rose
up
from
the
groupe
to
meet
me
as
i
advanced
towards
them
her
hair
which
was
a
dark
chesnut
approaching
rather
to
a
black
was
tied
up
in
a
knot
all
but
a
single
tress
we
want
a
cavalier
said
she
holding
out
both
her
hands
as
if
to
offer
them
and
a
cavalier
ye
shall
have
said
i
taking
hold
of
both
of
them
hadst
thou
nannette
been
array
like
a
duchesse
but
that
cursed
slit
in
thy
petticoat
nannette
cared
not
for
it
we
could
not
have
done
without
you
said
she
letting
go
one
hand
with
politeness
leading
me
up
with
the
other
a
lame
youth
whom
apollo
had
recompensed
with
a
pipe
and
to
which
he
had
added
a
tabourin
of
his
own
accord
ran
sweetly
over
the
prelude
as
he
sat
upon
the
bank
tie
me
up
this
tress
instantly
said
nannette
putting
a
piece
of
string
into
my
hand
it
taught
me
to
forget
i
was
a
stranger
the
whole
knot
fell
down
we
had
been
seven
years
acquainted
the
youth
struck
the
note
upon
the
tabourin
his
pipe
followed
and
off
we
bounded

take
that
slit

sister
of
the
youth
who
had
stolen
her
voice
from

sung
alternately
with
her

nymphs

and
their

below

would
have
given
a

to
have
it

would
not
have

was
in

eyes
a

spark

amity
shot
across
the
space
betwixt
us

why
could
i
not
live
and
end
my
days
thus
just
disposer
of
our
joys
and
sorrows
cried
i
why
could
not
a
man
sit
down
in
the
lap
of
content
here
and
dance
and
sing
and
say
his
prayers
and
go
to
heaven
with
this
maid
capriciously
did
she
bend
her
head
on
one
side
and
dance
up
insidious
then
is
time
to
dance
off
quoth
i
so
changing
only
partners
and
tunes
i
danced
it
away
from
lunel
to
montpellier
from
thence
to
pescnas
beziers
i
danced
it
along
through
narbonne
carcasson
and
castle
naudairy
till
at
last
i
danced
myself
into
perdrillo
pavillion
where
pulling
out
a
paper
of
black
lines
that
i
might
go
on
straight
forwards
without
digression
or
parenthesis
in
my
uncle
toby
amours
i
begun
thus
chapter
but
softly
for
in
these
sportive
plains
and
under
this
genial
sun
where
at
this
instant
all
flesh
is
running
out
piping
fiddling
and
dancing
to
the
vintage
and
every
step
that
taken
the
judgment
is
surprised
by
the
imagination
i
defy
notwithstanding
all
that
has
been
said
upon
straight
lines
vid
vol
iii
in
sundry
pages
of
my
book
i
defy
the
best
cabbage
planter
that
ever
existed
whether
he
plants
backwards
or
forwards
it
makes
little
difference
in
the
account
except
that
he
will
have
more
to
answer
for
in
the
one
case
than
in
the
other
i
defy
him
to
go
on
coolly
critically
and
canonically
planting
his
cabbages
one
by
one
in
straight
lines
and
stoical
distances
especially
if
slits
in
petticoats
are
unsew
up
without
ever
and
anon
straddling
out
or
sidling
into
some
bastardly
digression
in
and
some
other
lands
i
wot
of
it
may
be
done
but
in
this
clear
climate
of
fantasy
and
perspiration
where
every
idea
sensible
and
insensible
gets
vent
in
this
land
my
dear
eugenius
in
this
fertile
land
of
chivalry
and
romance
where
i
now
sit
unskrewing
my
to
write
my
uncle
toby
amours
and
with
all
the
meanders
of
julia
track
in
quest
of
her
diego
in
full
view
of
my
study
window
if
thou
comest
not
and
takest
me
by
the
hand
what
a
work
it
is
likely
to
turn
out
let
us
begin
it
chapter
it
is
with
love
as
with
cuckoldom
but
now
i
am
talking
of
beginning
a
book
and
have
long
had
a
thing
upon
my
mind
to
be
imparted
to
the
reader
which
if
not
imparted
now
can
never
be
imparted
to
him
as
long
as
i
live
whereas
the
comparison
may
be
imparted
to
him
any
hour
in
the
day
i
just
mention
it
and
begin
in
good
earnest
the
thing
is
this
that
of
all
the
several
ways
of
beginning
a
book
which
are
now
in
practice
throughout
the
known
world
i
am
confident
my
own
way
of
doing
it
is
the
best
i
sure
it
is
the
most
religious
for
i
begin
with
writing
the
first
sentence
and
trusting
to
almighty
god
for
the
second
cure
an
author
for
ever
of
the
fuss
and
folly
of
opening
his
and
calling
in
his
neighbours
and
friends
and
kinsfolk
with
the
devil
and
all
his
imps
with
their
hammers
and
engines
only
to
observe
how
one
sentence
of
mine
follows
another
and
how
the
plan
follows
the
whole
i
wish
you
saw
me
half
starting
out
of
my
chair
with
what
confidence
as
i
grasp
the
elbow
of
it
i
look
up
catching
the
idea
even
sometimes
before
it
half
way
reaches
me
i
believe
in
my
conscience
i
intercept
many
a
thought
which
heaven
intended
for
another
man
pope
and
his
portrait
vid
pope
portrait
are
fools
to
me
no
martyr
is
ever
so
full
of
faith
or
fire
i
wish
i
could
say
of
good
works
too
but
i
have
no
zeal
or
anger
or
anger
or
zeal
and
till
gods
and
men
agree
together
to
call
it
by
the
same
name
the
errantest
tartuffe
in
science
in
politics
or
in
religion
shall
never
kindle
a
spark
within
me
or
have
a
worse
word
or
a
more
unkind
greeting
than
what
he
will
read
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
bon
jour
good
morrow
so
you
have
got
your
cloak
on
betimes
but
a
cold
morning
and
you
judge
the
matter
rightly
is
better
to
be
well
mounted
than
go
o
foot
and
obstructions
in
the
glands
are
dangerous
and
how
goes
it
with
thy
concubine
thy
wife
and
thy
little
ones
o
both
sides
and
when
did
you
hear
from
the
old
gentleman
and
lady
your
sister
aunt
uncle
and
cousins
i
hope
they
have
got
better
of
their
colds
coughs
claps
fevers
stranguries
sciaticas
swellings
and
sore
eyes
what
a
devil
of
an
apothecary
to
take
so
much
blood
give
such
a
vile
purge
puke
poultice
plaister
clyster
blister
and
why
so
many
grains
of
calomel
santa
maria
and
such
a
dose
of
opium
pardi
the
whole
family
of
ye
from
head
to
tail
by
my
dinah
old
black
velvet
mask
i
think
there
is
no
occasion
for
it
now
this
being
a
little
bald
about
the
chin
by
frequently
putting
off
and
on
before
she
was
got
with
child
by
the
coachman
not
one
of
our
family
would
wear
it
after
to
cover
the
mask
afresh
was
more
than
the
mask
was
worth
and
to
wear
a
mask
which
was
bald
or
which
could
be
half
seen
through
was
as
bad
as
having
no
mask
at
all
this
is
the
reason
may
it
please
your
reverences
that
in
all
our
numerous
family
for
these
four
generations
we
count
no
more
than
one
archbishop
a
welch
judge
some
three
or
four
aldermen
and
a
single
mountebank
in
the
sixteenth
century
we
boast
of
no
less
than
a
dozen
alchymists
chapter
is
with
love
as
with
cuckoldom
the
suffering
party
is
at
least
the
third
but
generally
the
last
in
the
house
who
knows
any
thing
about
the
matter
this
comes
as
all
the
world
knows
from
having
half
a
dozen
words
for
one
thing
and
so
long
as
what
in
this
vessel
of
the
human
frame
is
love
may
be
hatred
in
that
sentiment
half
a
yard
higher
and
nonsense
no
madam
not
there
i
mean
at
the
part
i
am
now
pointing
to
with
my
forefinger
how
can
we
help
ourselves
of
all
mortal
and
immortal
men
too
if
you
please
who
ever
soliloquized
upon
this
mystic
subject
my
uncle
toby
was
the
worst
fitted
to
have
push
his
researches
thro
such
a
contention
of
feelings
and
he
had
infallibly
let
them
all
run
on
as
we
do
worse
matters
to
see
what
they
would
turn
out
had
not
of
them
to
susannah
and
susannah
repeated
manifestoes
thereupon
to
all
the
world
made
it
necessary
for
my
uncle
toby
to
look
into
the
affair
chapter
why
weavers
gardeners
and
gladiators
or
a
man
with
a
pined
leg
proceeding
from
some
ailment
in
the
foot
should
ever
have
had
some
tender
nymph
breaking
her
heart
in
secret
for
them
are
points
well
and
duly
settled
and
accounted
for
by
ancient
and
modern
physiologists
a
provided
he
is
a
profess
one
and
does
it
without
fraud
or
covin
is
precisely
in
the
same
predicament
not
that
at
first
sight
there
is
any
consequence
or
show
of
logic
in
it
a
rill
of
cold
water
dribbling
through
my
inward
parts
should
light
up
a
torch
in
my
jenny
the
proposition
does
not
strike
one
on
the
contrary
it
seems
to
run
opposite
to
the
natural
workings
of
causes
and
effects
but
it
shews
the
weakness
and
imbecility
of
human
reason
in
perfect
good
health
with
it
the
most
perfect
madam
that
friendship
herself
could
wish
me
drink
nothing
nothing
but
water
impetuous
fluid
the
moment
thou
pressest
against
the
of
the
brain
see
how
they
give
way
in
swims
curiosity
beckoning
to
her
damsels
to
follow
they
dive
into
the
center
of
the
current
fancy
sits
musing
upon
the
bank
and
with
her
eyes
following
the
stream
turns
straws
and
bulrushes
into
masts
and
and
desire
with
vest
held
up
to
the
knee
in
one
hand
snatches
at
them
as
they
swim
by
her
with
the
other
o
ye
water
drinkers
is
it
then
by
this
delusive
fountain
that
ye
have
so
often
governed
and
turn
this
world
about
like
a
grinding
the
faces
of
the
impotent
bepowdering
their
ribs
bepeppering
their
noses
and
changing
sometimes
even
the
very
frame
and
face
of
nature
if
i
was
you
quoth
yorick
i
would
drink
more
water
eugenius
and
if
i
was
you
yorick
replied
eugenius
so
would
i
which
shews
they
had
both
read
longinus
for
my
own
part
i
am
resolved
never
to
read
any
book
but
my
own
as
long
as
i
live
chapter
i
wish
my
uncle
toby
had
been
a
for
then
the
thing
had
been
accounted
for
that
the
first
moment
widow
wadman
saw
him
she
felt
something
stirring
within
her
in
his
favour
something
something
something
perhaps
more
than
friendship
less
than
love
something
no
matter
what
no
matter
where
i
would
not
give
a
single
hair
off
my
mule
tail
and
be
obliged
to
pluck
it
off
myself
indeed
the
villain
has
not
many
to
spare
and
is
not
a
little
vicious
into
the
bargain
to
be
let
by
your
worships
into
the
secret
but
the
truth
is
my
uncle
toby
was
not
a
he
drank
it
neither
pure
nor
mix
or
any
how
or
any
where
except
fortuitously
upon
some
advanced
posts
where
better
liquor
was
not
to
be
had
or
during
the
time
he
was
under
cure
when
the
surgeon
telling
him
it
would
extend
the
fibres
and
bring
them
sooner
into
contact
my
uncle
toby
drank
it
for
quietness
sake
now
as
all
the
world
knows
that
no
effect
in
nature
can
be
produced
without
a
cause
and
as
it
is
as
well
known
that
my
uncle
toby
was
neither
a
weaver
a
gardener
or
a
gladiator
unless
as
a
captain
you
will
needs
have
him
one
but
then
he
was
only
a
captain
of
foot
and
besides
the
whole
is
an
equivocation
there
is
nothing
left
for
us
to
suppose
but
that
my
uncle
toby
leg
but
that
will
avail
us
little
in
the
present
hypothesis
unless
it
had
proceeded
from
some
ailment
in
the
foot
whereas
his
leg
was
not
emaciated
from
any
disorder
in
his
foot
for
my
uncle
toby
leg
was
not
emaciated
at
all
it
was
a
little
stiff
and
awkward
from
a
total
disuse
of
it
for
the
three
years
he
lay
confined
at
my
father
house
in
town
but
it
was
plump
and
muscular
and
in
all
other
respects
as
good
and
promising
a
leg
as
the
other
i
declare
i
do
not
recollect
any
one
opinion
or
passage
of
my
life
where
my
understanding
was
more
at
a
loss
to
make
ends
meet
and
torture
the
chapter
i
had
been
writing
to
the
service
of
the
chapter
following
it
than
in
the
present
case
one
would
think
i
took
a
pleasure
in
running
into
difficulties
of
this
kind
merely
to
make
fresh
experiments
of
getting
out
of
inconsiderate
soul
that
thou
art
what
are
not
the
unavoidable
distresses
with
which
as
an
author
and
a
man
thou
art
hemm
in
on
every
side
of
thee
are
they
tristram
not
sufficient
but
thou
must
entangle
thyself
still
more
is
it
not
enough
that
thou
art
in
debt
and
that
thou
hast
ten
of
thy
fifth
and
sixth
volumes
alluding
to
the
first
edition
still
still
unsold
and
art
almost
at
thy
wit
ends
how
to
get
them
off
thy
hands
to
this
hour
art
thou
not
tormented
with
the
vile
asthma
that
thou
gattest
in
skating
against
the
wind
in
flanders
and
is
it
but
two
months
ago
that
in
a
fit
of
laughter
on
seeing
a
cardinal
make
water
like
a
quirister
with
both
hands
thou
brakest
a
vessel
in
thy
lungs
whereby
in
two
hours
thou
lost
as
many
quarts
of
blood
and
hadst
thou
lost
as
much
more
did
not
the
faculty
tell
thee
it
would
have
amounted
to
a
gallon
chapter
but
for
heaven
sake
let
us
not
talk
of
quarts
or
gallons
let
us
take
the
story
straight
before
us
it
is
so
nice
and
intricate
a
one
it
will
scarce
bear
the
transposition
of
a
single
tittle
and
somehow
or
other
you
have
got
me
thrust
almost
into
the
middle
of
it
i
beg
we
may
take
more
care
chapter
my
uncle
toby
and
the
corporal
had
posted
down
with
so
much
heat
and
precipitation
to
take
possession
of
the
spot
of
ground
we
have
so
often
spoke
of
in
order
to
open
their
campaign
as
early
as
the
rest
of
the
allies
that
they
had
forgot
one
of
the
most
necessary
articles
of
the
whole
affair
it
was
neither
a
pioneer
spade
a
pickax
or
a
shovel
it
was
a
bed
to
lie
on
so
that
as
was
at
that
time
unfurnished
and
the
little
inn
where
poor
le
fever
died
not
yet
built
my
uncle
toby
was
constrained
to
accept
of
a
bed
at
wadman
for
a
night
or
two
till
corporal
trim
who
to
the
character
of
an
excellent
valet
groom
cook
sempster
surgeon
and
engineer
that
of
an
excellent
upholsterer
too
with
the
help
of
a
carpenter
and
a
couple
of
taylors
constructed
one
in
my
uncle
toby
house
a
daughter
of
eve
for
such
was
widow
wadman
and
is
all
the
character
i
intend
to
give
of
her
she
was
a
perfect
woman
had
better
be
fifty
leagues
off
or
in
her
warm
bed
or
playing
with
a
or
any
thing
you
please
than
make
a
man
the
object
of
her
attention
when
the
house
and
all
the
furniture
is
her
own
there
is
nothing
in
it
out
of
doors
and
in
broad
where
a
woman
has
a
power
physically
speaking
of
viewing
a
man
in
more
lights
than
one
but
here
for
her
soul
she
can
see
him
in
no
light
without
mixing
something
of
her
own
goods
and
chattels
along
with
him
till
by
reiterated
acts
of
such
combination
he
gets
foisted
into
her
inventory
and
then
good
night
but
this
is
not
matter
of
system
for
i
have
delivered
that
above
nor
is
it
matter
of
breviary
for
i
make
no
man
creed
but
my
own
nor
matter
of
fact
at
least
that
i
know
of
but
is
matter
copulative
and
introductory
to
what
follows
chapter
i
do
not
speak
it
with
regard
to
the
coarseness
or
cleanness
of
them
or
the
strength
of
their
gussets
but
pray
do
not
differ
from
as
much
in
this
particular
as
in
any
thing
else
in
the
world
that
they
so
far
exceed
the
others
in
length
that
when
you
are
laid
down
in
them
they
fall
almost
as
much
below
the
feet
as
the
fall
short
of
them
widow
wadman
as
was
the
mode
i
suppose
in
king
and
queen
anne
reigns
were
cut
however
after
this
fashion
and
if
the
fashion
is
changed
for
in
italy
they
are
come
to
nothing
so
much
the
worse
for
the
public
they
were
two
flemish
ells
and
a
half
in
length
so
that
allowing
a
moderate
woman
two
ells
she
had
half
an
ell
to
spare
to
do
what
she
would
with
now
from
one
little
indulgence
gained
after
another
in
the
many
bleak
and
decemberley
nights
of
a
seven
years
things
had
insensibly
come
to
this
pass
and
for
the
two
last
years
had
got
establish
into
one
of
the
ordinances
of
the
that
as
soon
as
wadman
was
put
to
bed
and
had
got
her
legs
stretched
down
to
the
bottom
of
it
of
which
she
always
gave
bridget
notice
bridget
with
all
suitable
decorum
having
first
open
the
at
the
feet
took
hold
of
the
of
cloth
we
are
speaking
of
and
having
gently
and
with
both
her
hands
drawn
it
downwards
to
its
furthest
extension
and
then
contracted
it
again
by
four
or
five
even
plaits
she
took
a
large
out
of
her
sleeve
and
with
the
point
directed
towards
her
pinn
the
plaits
all
fast
together
a
little
above
the
hem
which
done
she
tuck
all
in
tight
at
the
feet
and
wish
her
mistress
a
good
night
this
was
constant
and
without
any
other
variation
than
this
that
on
shivering
and
tempestuous
nights
when
bridget
untuck
the
feet
of
the
bed
to
do
this
she
consulted
no
thermometer
but
that
of
her
own
passions
and
so
performed
it
standing
kneeling
or
squatting
according
to
the
different
degrees
of
faith
hope
and
charity
she
was
in
and
bore
towards
her
mistress
that
night
in
every
other
respect
the
etiquette
was
sacred
and
might
have
vied
with
the
most
mechanical
one
of
the
most
inflexible
in
christendom
the
first
night
as
soon
as
the
corporal
had
conducted
my
uncle
toby
up
stairs
which
was
about
ten
wadman
threw
herself
into
her
and
crossing
her
left
knee
with
her
right
which
formed
a
for
her
elbow
she
reclin
her
cheek
upon
the
palm
of
her
hand
and
leaning
forwards
ruminated
till
midnight
upon
both
sides
of
the
question
the
second
night
she
went
to
her
bureau
and
having
ordered
bridget
to
bring
her
up
a
couple
of
fresh
candles
and
leave
them
upon
the
table
she
took
out
her
and
read
it
over
with
great
devotion
and
the
third
night
which
was
the
last
of
my
uncle
stay
when
bridget
had
pull
down
the
and
was
assaying
to
stick
in
the
corking
pin
with
a
kick
of
both
heels
at
once
but
at
the
same
time
the
most
natural
kick
that
could
be
kick
in
her
situation
for
supposing
to
be
the
sun
in
its
meridian
it
was
a
kick
she
kick
the
pin
out
of
her
fingers
the
etiquette
which
hung
upon
it
down
down
it
fell
to
the
ground
and
was
shiver
into
a
thousand
atoms
from
all
which
it
was
plain
that
widow
wadman
was
in
love
with
my
uncle
toby
chapter
my
uncle
toby
head
at
that
time
was
full
of
other
matters
so
that
it
was
not
till
the
demolition
of
dunkirk
when
all
the
other
civilities
of
europe
were
settled
that
he
found
leisure
to
return
this
this
made
an
armistice
that
is
speaking
with
regard
to
my
uncle
toby
but
with
respect
to
wadman
a
vacancy
of
almost
eleven
years
but
in
all
cases
of
this
nature
as
it
is
the
second
blow
happen
at
what
distance
of
time
it
will
which
makes
the
fray
i
chuse
for
that
reason
to
call
these
the
amours
of
my
uncle
toby
with
wadman
rather
than
the
amours
of
wadman
with
my
uncle
toby
this
is
not
a
distinction
without
a
difference
it
is
not
like
the
affair
of
an
old
hat
cock
and
a
cock
old
hat
about
which
your
reverences
have
so
often
been
at
odds
with
one
another
but
there
is
a
difference
here
in
the
nature
of
things
and
let
me
tell
you
gentry
a
wide
one
too
chapter
now
as
widow
wadman
did
love
my
uncle
toby
and
my
uncle
toby
did
not
love
widow
wadman
there
was
nothing
for
widow
wadman
to
do
but
to
go
on
and
love
my
uncle
toby
or
let
it
alone
widow
wadman
would
do
neither
the
one
or
the
other
gracious
heaven
but
i
forget
i
am
a
little
of
her
temper
myself
for
whenever
it
so
falls
out
which
it
sometimes
does
about
the
equinoxes
that
an
earthly
goddess
is
so
much
this
and
that
and
that
i
can
not
eat
my
breakfast
for
her
and
that
she
careth
not
three
halfpence
whether
i
eat
my
breakfast
or
no
curse
on
her
and
so
i
send
her
to
tartary
and
from
tartary
to
terra
del
fuogo
and
so
on
to
the
devil
in
short
there
is
not
an
infernal
nitch
where
i
do
not
take
her
divinityship
and
stick
it
but
as
the
heart
is
tender
and
the
passions
in
these
tides
ebb
and
flow
ten
times
in
a
minute
i
instantly
bring
her
back
again
and
as
i
do
all
things
in
extremes
i
place
her
in
the
very
center
of
the
brightest
of
stars
thou
wilt
shed
thy
influence
upon
some
one
the
duce
take
her
and
her
influence
too
for
at
that
word
i
lose
all
patience
much
good
may
it
do
him
by
all
that
is
hirsute
and
gashly
i
cry
taking
off
my
furr
cap
and
twisting
it
round
my
finger
i
would
not
give
sixpence
for
a
dozen
such
but
is
an
excellent
cap
too
putting
it
upon
my
head
and
pressing
it
close
to
my
ears
and
warm
and
soft
especially
if
you
stroke
it
the
right
way
but
alas
that
will
never
be
my
luck
so
here
my
philosophy
is
shipwreck
again
no
i
shall
never
have
a
finger
in
the
pye
so
here
i
break
my
metaphor
crust
and
crumb
inside
and
out
top
and
bottom
i
detest
it
i
hate
it
i
repudiate
it
i
sick
at
the
sight
of
it
is
all
pepper
garlick
staragen
salt
and
devil
dung
by
the
great
of
cooks
who
does
nothing
i
think
from
morning
to
night
but
sit
down
by
the
and
invent
inflammatory
dishes
for
us
i
would
not
touch
it
for
the
world
o
tristram

cried
jenny
o

replied
i
and
so
went
on
with
the
chapter
chapter
touch
it
for
the
world
did
i
say
lord
how
i
have
heated
my
imagination
with
this
metaphor
chapter
which
shews
let
your
reverences
and
worships
say
what
you
will
of
it
for
as
for
thinking
all
who
do
think
think
pretty
much
alike
both
upon
it
and
other
matters
love
is
certainly
at

alphabetically

one

though
by
the
bye
the

should
have
gone
first
but
in
short
is
of
such
a
nature
as
my
father
once
told
my
uncle
toby
upon
the
close
of
a
long
dissertation
upon
the
subject
can
scarce
said
he
two
ideas
together
upon
it
brother
toby
without
an
hypallage
that
cried
my
uncle
toby
the
cart
before
the
horse
replied
my
father
and
what
is
he
to
do
there
cried
my
uncle
toby
nothing
quoth
my
father
but
to
get
in
or
let
it
alone
now
widow
wadman
as
i
told
you
before
would
do
neither
the
one
or
the
other
she
stood
however
ready
harnessed
and
caparisoned
at
all
points
to
watch
accidents
chapter
the
fates
who
certainly
all
of
these
amours
of
widow
wadman
and
my
uncle
toby
had
from
the
first
creation
of
matter
and
motion
and
with
more
courtesy
than
they
usually
do
things
of
this
kind
established
such
a
chain
of
causes
and
effects
hanging
so
fast
to
one
another
that
it
was
scarce
possible
for
my
uncle
toby
to
have
dwelt
in
any
other
house
in
the
world
or
to
have
occupied
any
other
garden
in
christendom
but
the
very
house
and
garden
which
join
and
laid
parallel
to
wadman
this
with
the
advantage
of
a
thickset
arbour
in
wadman
garden
but
planted
in
the
of
my
uncle
toby
put
all
the
occasions
into
her
hands
which
wanted
she
could
observe
my
uncle
toby
motions
and
was
mistress
likewise
of
his
councils
of
war
and
as
his
unsuspecting
heart
had
given
leave
to
the
corporal
through
the
mediation
of
bridget
to
make
her
a
of
communication
to
enlarge
her
walks
it
enabled
her
to
carry
on
her
approaches
to
the
very
door
of
the
and
sometimes
out
of
gratitude
to
make
an
attack
and
endeavour
to
blow
my
uncle
toby
up
in
the
very
itself
chapter
it
is
a
great
pity
but
is
certain
from
every
day
observation
of
man
that
he
may
be
set
on
fire
like
a
candle
at
either
end
provided
there
is
a
sufficient
wick
standing
out
if
there
is
not
there
an
end
of
the
affair
and
if
there
is
by
lighting
it
at
the
bottom
as
the
flame
in
that
case
has
the
misfortune
generally
to
put
out
itself
there
an
end
of
the
affair
again
for
my
part
could
i
always
have
the
ordering
of
it
which
way
i
would
be
burnt
myself
for
i
can
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
being
burnt
like
a
beast
i
would
oblige
a
housewife
constantly
to
light
me
at
the
top
for
then
i
should
burn
down
decently
to
the
socket
that
is
from
my
head
to
my
heart
from
my
heart
to
my
liver
from
my
liver
to
my
bowels
and
so
on
by
the
meseraick
veins
and
arteries
through
all
the
turns
and
lateral
insertions
of
the
intestines
and
their
tunicles
to
the
blind
gut
i
beseech
you
doctor
slop
quoth
my
uncle
toby
interrupting
him
as
he
mentioned
the
blind
gut
in
a
discourse
with
my
father
the
night
my
mother
was
brought
to
bed
of
me
i
beseech
you
quoth
my
uncle
toby
to
tell
me
which
is
the
blind
gut
for
old
as
i
am
i
vow
i
do
not
know
to
this
day
where
it
lies
the
blind
gut
answered
doctor
slop
lies
betwixt
the
ilion
and
colon
in
a
man
said
my
father
is
precisely
the
same
cried
doctor
slop
in
a
that
more
than
i
know
quoth
my
father
chapter
and
so
to
make
sure
of
both
systems
wadman
predetermined
to
light
my
uncle
toby
neither
at
this
end
or
that
but
like
a
candle
to
light
him
if
possible
at
both
ends
at
once
now
through
all
the
lumber
rooms
of
military
furniture
including
both
of
horse
and
foot
from
the
great
arsenal
of
venice
to
the
tower
of
london
exclusive
if
wadman
had
been
rummaging
for
seven
years
together
and
with
bridget
to
help
her
she
could
not
have
found
any
one
blind
or
mantelet
so
fit
for
her
purpose
as
that
which
the
expediency
of
my
uncle
toby
affairs
had
fix
up
ready
to
her
hands
i
believe
i
have
not
told
you
but
i
do
know
possibly
i
have
be
it
as
it
will
is
one
of
the
number
of
those
many
things
which
a
man
had
better
do
over
again
than
dispute
about
it
that
whatever
town
or
fortress
the
corporal
was
at
work
upon
during
the
course
of
their
campaign
my
uncle
toby
always
took
care
on
the
inside
of
his
which
was
towards
his
left
hand
to
have
a
plan
of
the
place
fasten
up
with
two
or
three
pins
at
the
top
but
loose
at
the
bottom
for
the
conveniency
of
holding
it
up
to
the
eye
c
as
occasions
required
so
that
when
an
attack
was
resolved
upon
wadman
had
nothing
more
to
do
when
she
had
got
advanced
to
the
door
of
the
but
to
extend
her
right
hand
and
edging
in
her
left
foot
at
the
same
movement
to
take
hold
of
the
map
or
plan
or
upright
or
whatever
it
was
and
with
neck
meeting
it
half
way
to
advance
it
towards
her
on
which
my
uncle
toby
passions
were
sure
to
catch
fire
for
he
would
instantly
take
hold
of
the
other
corner
of
the
map
in
his
left
hand
and
with
the
end
of
his
pipe
in
the
other
begin
an
explanation
when
the
attack
was
advanced
to
this
point
the
world
will
naturally
enter
into
the
reasons
of
wadman
next
stroke
of
generalship
which
was
to
take
my
uncle
toby
out
of
his
hand
as
soon
as
she
possibly
could
which
under
one
pretence
or
other
but
generally
that
of
pointing
more
distinctly
at
some
redoubt
or
breastwork
in
the
map
she
would
effect
before
my
uncle
toby
poor
soul
had
well
march
above
half
a
dozen
toises
with
it
it
obliged
my
uncle
toby
to
make
use
of
his
forefinger
the
difference
it
made
in
the
attack
was
this
that
in
going
upon
it
as
in
the
first
case
with
the
end
of
her
against
the
end
of
my
uncle
toby
she
might
have
travelled
with
it
along
the
lines
from
dan
to
beersheba
had
my
uncle
toby
lines
reach
so
far
without
any
effect
for
as
there
was
no
arterial
or
vital
heat
in
the
end
of
the
it
could
excite
no
sentiment
it
could
neither
give
fire
by
pulsation
or
receive
it
by
sympathy
was
nothing
but
smoke
whereas
in
following
my
uncle
toby
forefinger
with
hers
close
all
the
little
turns
and
indentings
of
his
works
pressing
sometimes
against
the
side
of
it
then
treading
upon
its
nail
then
tripping
it
up
then
touching
it
here
then
there
and
so
on
it
set
something
at
least
in
motion
this
tho
slight
skirmishing
and
at
a
distance
from
the
main
body
yet
drew
on
the
rest
for
here
the
map
usually
falling
with
the
back
of
it
close
to
the
side
of
the
my
uncle
toby
in
the
simplicity
of
his
soul
would
lay
his
hand
flat
upon
it
in
order
to
go
on
with
his
explanation
and
wadman
by
a
manoeuvre
as
quick
as
thought
would
as
certainly
place
her
close
beside
it
this
at
once
opened
a
communication
large
enough
for
any
sentiment
to
pass
or
which
a
person
skill
in
the
elementary
and
practical
part
of
has
occasion
for
by
bringing
up
her
forefinger
parallel
as
before
to
my
uncle
toby
it
unavoidably
brought
the
thumb
into
action
and
the
forefinger
and
thumb
being
once
engaged
as
naturally
brought
in
the
whole
hand
thine
dear
uncle
toby
was
never
now
in
right
place
wadman
had
it
ever
to
take
up
or
with
the
gentlest
pushings
protrusions
and
equivocal
compressions
that
a
hand
to
be
removed
is
capable
of
receiving
to
get
it
press
a
hair
breadth
of
one
side
out
of
her
way
whilst
this
was
doing
how
could
she
forget
to
make
him
sensible
that
it
was
her
leg
and
no
one
else
at
the
bottom
of
the
which
slightly
press
against
the
calf
of
his
so
that
my
uncle
toby
being
thus
attack
and
sore
push
on
both
his
wings
was
it
a
wonder
if
now
and
then
it
put
his
centre
into
disorder
the
duce
take
it
said
my
uncle
toby
chapter
these
attacks
of
wadman
you
will
readily
conceive
to
be
of
different
kinds
varying
from
each
other
like
the
attacks
which
history
is
full
of
and
from
the
same
reasons
a
general
would
scarce
allow
them
to
be
attacks
at
all
or
if
he
did
would
confound
them
all
together
but
i
write
not
to
them
it
will
be
time
enough
to
be
a
little
more
exact
in
my
descriptions
of
them
as
i
come
up
to
them
which
will
not
be
for
some
chapters
having
nothing
more
to
add
in
this
but
that
in
a
bundle
of
original
papers
and
drawings
which
my
father
took
care
to
roll
up
by
themselves
there
is
a
plan
of
bouchain
in
perfect
preservation
and
shall
be
kept
so
whilst
i
have
power
to
preserve
any
thing
upon
the
lower
corner
of
which
on
the
right
hand
side
there
is
still
remaining
the
marks
of
a
snuffy
finger
and
thumb
which
there
is
all
the
reason
in
the
world
to
imagine
were
wadman
for
the
opposite
side
of
the
margin
which
i
suppose
to
have
been
my
uncle
toby
is
absolutely
clean
this
seems
an
authenticated
record
of
one
of
these
attacks
for
there
are
vestigia
of
the
two
punctures
partly
grown
up
but
still
visible
on
the
opposite
corner
of
the
map
which
are
unquestionably
the
very
holes
through
which
it
has
been
pricked
up
in
the
by
all
that
is
priestly
i
value
this
precious
relick
with
its
stigmata
and
pricks
more
than
all
the
relicks
of
the
romish
church
always
excepting
when
i
am
writing
upon
these
matters
the
pricks
which
entered
the
flesh
of
radagunda
in
the
desert
which
in
your
road
from
fesse
to
cluny
the
nuns
of
that
name
will
shew
you
for
love
chapter
i
think
an
please
your
honour
quoth
trim
the
fortifications
are
quite
destroyed
and
the
bason
is
upon
a
level
with
the
mole
i
think
so
too
replied
my
uncle
toby
with
a
sigh
half
suppress
but
step
into
the
parlour
trim
for
the
stipulation
it
lies
upon
the
table
it
has
lain
there
these
six
weeks
replied
the
corporal
till
this
very
morning
that
the
old
woman
kindled
the
fire
with
it
then
said
my
uncle
toby
there
is
no
further
occasion
for
our
services
the
more
an
please
your
honour
the
pity
said
the
corporal
in
uttering
which
he
cast
his
spade
into
the
which
was
beside
him
with
an
air
the
most
expressive
of
disconsolation
that
can
be
imagined
and
was
heavily
turning
about
to
look
for
his
pickax
his
pioneer
shovel
his
picquets
and
other
little
military
stores
in
order
to
carry
them
off
the
field
when
a
from
the
which
being
made
of
thin
slit
deal
reverberated
the
sound
more
sorrowfully
to
his
ear
forbad
him
no
said
the
corporal
to
himself
i
do
it
before
his
honour
rises
morning
so
taking
his
spade
out
of
the
again
with
a
little
earth
in
it
as
if
to
level
something
at
the
foot
of
the
glacis
but
with
a
real
intent
to
approach
nearer
to
his
master
in
order
to
divert
him
he
loosen
a
sod
or
two
pared
their
edges
with
his
spade
and
having
given
them
a
gentle
blow
or
two
with
the
back
of
it
he
sat
himself
down
close
by
my
uncle
toby
feet
and
began
as
follows
chapter
it
was
a
thousand
pities
though
i
believe
an
please
your
honour
i
am
going
to
say
but
a
foolish
kind
of
a
thing
for
a
soldier
a
soldier
cried
my
uncle
toby
interrupting
the
corporal
is
no
more
exempt
from
saying
a
foolish
thing
trim
than
a
man
of
letters
but
not
so
often
an
please
your
honour
replied
the
corporal
my
uncle
toby
gave
a
nod
it
was
a
thousand
pities
then
said
the
corporal
casting
his
eye
upon
dunkirk
and
the
mole
as
servius
sulpicius
in
returning
out
of
asia
when
he
sailed
from
aegina
towards
megara
did
upon
corinth
and
pyreus
was
a
thousand
pities
an
please
your
honour
to
destroy
these
works
and
a
thousand
pities
to
have
let
them
stood
thou
art
right
trim
in
both
cases
said
my
uncle
this
continued
the
corporal
is
the
reason
that
from
the
beginning
of
their
demolition
to
the
end
i
have
never
once
whistled
or
sung
or
laugh
or
cry
or
talk
of
past
done
deeds
or
told
your
honour
one
story
good
or
bad
thou
hast
many
excellencies
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
and
i
hold
it
not
the
least
of
them
as
thou
happenest
to
be
a
that
of
the
number
thou
hast
told
me
either
to
amuse
me
in
my
painful
hours
or
divert
me
in
my
grave
ones
thou
hast
seldom
told
me
a
bad
one
because
an
please
your
honour
except
one
of
a
king
of
bohemia
and
his
seven
castles
they
are
all
true
for
they
are
about
myself
i
do
not
like
the
subject
the
worse
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
on
that
score
but
prithee
what
is
this
story
thou
hast
excited
my
curiosity
i
tell
it
your
honour
quoth
the
corporal
directly
provided
said
my
uncle
toby
looking
earnestly
towards
dunkirk
and
the
mole
again
provided
it
is
not
a
merry
one
to
such
trim
a
man
should
ever
bring
one
half
of
the
entertainment
along
with
him
and
the
disposition
i
am
in
at
present
would
wrong
both
thee
trim
and
thy
story
it
is
not
a
merry
one
by
any
means
replied
the
corporal
nor
would
i
have
it
altogether
a
grave
one
added
my
uncle
toby
it
is
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
replied
the
corporal
but
will
suit
your
honour
exactly
then
i
thank
thee
for
it
with
all
my
heart
cried
my
uncle
toby
so
prithee
begin
it
trim
the
corporal
made
his
reverence
and
though
it
is
not
so
easy
a
matter
as
the
world
imagines
to
pull
off
a
lank
with
grace
or
a
whit
less
difficult
in
my
conceptions
when
a
man
is
sitting
squat
upon
the
ground
to
make
a
bow
so
teeming
with
respect
as
the
corporal
was
wont
yet
by
suffering
the
palm
of
his
right
hand
which
was
towards
his
master
to
slip
backwards
upon
the
grass
a
little
beyond
his
body
in
order
to
allow
it
the
greater
sweep
and
by
an
unforced
compression
at
the
same
time
of
his
cap
with
the
thumb
and
the
two
forefingers
of
his
left
by
which
the
diameter
of
the
cap
became
reduced
so
that
it
might
be
said
rather
to
be
insensibly
squeez
than
pull
off
with
a
flatus
the
corporal
acquitted
himself
of
both
in
a
better
manner
than
the
posture
of
his
affairs
promised
and
having
hemmed
twice
to
find
in
what
key
his
story
would
best
go
and
best
suit
his
master
humour
he
exchanged
a
single
look
of
kindness
with
him
and
set
off
thus
the
story
of
the
king
of
bohemia
and
his
seven
castles
there
was
a
certain
king
of
bo
he
as
the
corporal
was
entering
the
confines
of
bohemia
my
uncle
toby
obliged
him
to
halt
for
a
single
moment
he
had
set
out
having
since
he
pull
off
his
in
the
latter
end
of
the
last
chapter
left
it
lying
beside
him
on
the
ground
the
eye
of
goodness
espieth
all
things
so
that
before
the
corporal
had
well
got
through
the
first
five
words
of
his
story
had
my
uncle
toby
twice
touch
his
with
the
end
of
his
cane
interrogatively
as
much
as
to
say
why
do
you
put
it
on
trim
trim
took
it
up
with
the
most
respectful
slowness
and
casting
a
glance
of
humiliation
as
he
did
it
upon
the
embroidery
of
the
which
being
dismally
tarnish
and
fray
moreover
in
some
of
the
principal
leaves
and
boldest
parts
of
the
pattern
he
lay
it
down
again
between
his
two
feet
in
order
to
moralize
upon
the
subject
is
every
word
of
it
but
too
true
cried
my
uncle
toby
that
thou
art
about
to
observe
in
this
world
trim
is
made
to
last
for
ever
but
when
tokens
dear
tom
of
thy
love
and
remembrance
wear
out
said
trim
what
shall
we
say
there
is
no
occasion
trim
quoth
my
uncle
toby
to
say
any
thing
else
and
was
a
man
to
puzzle
his
brains
till
doom
day
i
believe
trim
it
would
be
impossible
the
corporal
perceiving
my
uncle
toby
was
in
the
right
and
that
it
would
be
in
vain
for
the
wit
of
man
to
think
of
extracting
a
purer
moral
from
his
cap
without
further
attempting
it
he
put
it
on
and
passing
his
hand
across
his
forehead
to
rub
out
a
pensive
wrinkle
which
the
text
and
the
doctrine
between
them
had
engender
he
return
with
the
same
look
and
tone
of
voice
to
his
story
of
the
king
of
bohemia
and
his
seven
castles
the
story
of
the
king
of
bohemia
and
his
seven
castles
continued
there
was
a
certain
king
of
bohemia
but
in
whose
reign
except
his
own
i
am
not
able
to
inform
your
honour
i
do
not
desire
it
of
thee
trim
by
any
means
cried
my
uncle
toby
it
was
a
little
before
the
time
an
please
your
honour
when
giants
were
beginning
to
leave
off
breeding
but
in
what
year
of
our
lord
that
was
i
would
not
give
a
halfpenny
to
know
said
my
uncle
toby
only
an
please
your
honour
it
makes
a
story
look
the
better
in
the
face
is
thy
own
trim
so
ornament
it
after
thy
own
fashion
and
take
any
date
continued
my
uncle
toby
looking
pleasantly
upon
him
take
any
date
in
the
whole
world
thou
chusest
and
put
it
to
thou
art
heartily
welcome
the
corporal
bowed
for
of
every
century
and
of
every
year
of
that
century
from
the
first
creation
of
the
world
down
to
noah
flood
and
from
noah
flood
to
the
birth
of
abraham
through
all
the
pilgrimages
of
the
patriarchs
to
the
departure
of
the
israelites
out
of
egypt
and
throughout
all
the
dynasties
olympiads
urbeconditas
and
other
memorable
epochas
of
the
different
nations
of
the
world
down
to
the
coming
of
christ
and
from
thence
to
the
very
moment
in
which
the
corporal
was
telling
his
story
had
my
uncle
toby
subjected
this
vast
empire
of
time
and
all
its
abysses
at
his
feet
but
as
modesty
scarce
touches
with
a
finger
what
liberality
offers
her
with
both
hands
open
the
corporal
contented
himself
with
the
very
worst
year
of
the
whole
bunch
which
to
prevent
your
honours
of
the
majority
and
minority
from
tearing
the
very
flesh
off
your
bones
in
contestation
that
year
is
not
always
the
last
of
the
last
i
tell
you
plainly
it
was
but
from
a
different
reason
than
you
wot
of
it
was
the
year
next
him
which
being
the
year
of
our
lord
seventeen
hundred
and
twelve
when
the
duke
of
ormond
was
playing
the
devil
in
flanders
the
corporal
took
it
and
set
out
with
it
afresh
on
his
expedition
to
bohemia
the
story
of
the
king
of
bohemia
and
his
seven
castles
continued
in
the
year
of
our
lord
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
twelve
there
was
an
please
your
honour
to
tell
thee
truly
trim
quoth
my
uncle
toby
any
other
date
would
have
pleased
me
much
better
not
only
on
account
of
the
sad
stain
upon
our
history
that
year
in
marching
off
our
troops
and
refusing
to
cover
the
siege
of
quesnoi
though
fagel
was
carrying
on
the
works
with
such
incredible
vigour
but
likewise
on
the
score
trim
of
thy
own
story
because
if
there
are
and
which
from
what
thou
hast
dropt
i
partly
suspect
to
be
the
fact
if
there
are
giants
in
it
there
is
but
one
an
please
your
honour
is
as
bad
as
twenty
replied
my
uncle
toby
thou
have
carried
him
back
some
seven
or
eight
hundred
years
out
of
harm
way
both
of
critics
and
other
people
and
therefore
i
would
advise
thee
if
ever
thou
tellest
it
again
if
i
live
an
please
your
honour
but
once
to
get
through
it
i
will
never
tell
it
again
quoth
trim
either
to
man
woman
or
child
poo
poo
said
my
uncle
toby
but
with
accents
of
such
sweet
encouragement
did
he
utter
it
that
the
corporal
went
on
with
his
story
with
more
alacrity
than
ever
the
story
of
the
king
of
bohemia
and
his
seven
castles
continued
there
was
an
please
your
honour
said
the
corporal
raising
his
voice
and
rubbing
the
palms
of
his
two
hands
cheerily
together
as
he
begun
a
certain
king
of
bohemia
leave
out
the
date
entirely
trim
quoth
my
uncle
toby
leaning
forwards
and
laying
his
hand
gently
upon
the
corporal
shoulder
to
temper
the
interruption
leave
it
out
entirely
trim
a
story
passes
very
well
without
these
niceties
unless
one
is
pretty
sure
of
sure
of
said
the
corporal
shaking
his
head
right
answered
my
uncle
toby
it
is
not
easy
trim
for
one
bred
up
as
thou
and
i
have
been
to
arms
who
seldom
looks
further
forward
than
to
the
end
of
his
musket
or
backwards
beyond
his
knapsack
to
know
much
about
this
matter
god
bless
your
honour
said
the
corporal
won
by
the
manner
of
my
uncle
toby
reasoning
as
much
as
by
the
reasoning
itself
he
has
something
else
to
do
if
not
on
action
or
a
march
or
upon
duty
in
his
garrison
he
has
his
firelock
an
please
your
honour
to
furbish
his
accoutrements
to
take
care
of
his
regimentals
to
mend
himself
to
shave
and
keep
clean
so
as
to
appear
always
like
what
he
is
upon
the
parade
what
business
added
the
corporal
triumphantly
has
a
soldier
an
please
your
honour
to
know
any
thing
at
all
of
geography
thou
have
said
chronology
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
for
as
for
geography
is
of
absolute
use
to
him
he
must
be
acquainted
intimately
with
every
country
and
its
boundaries
where
his
profession
carries
him
he
should
know
every
town
and
city
and
village
and
hamlet
with
the
canals
the
roads
and
hollow
ways
which
lead
up
to
them
there
is
not
a
river
or
a
rivulet
he
passes
trim
but
he
should
be
able
at
first
sight
to
tell
thee
what
is
its
name
in
what
mountains
it
takes
its
rise
what
is
its
course
how
far
it
is
navigable
where
fordable
where
not
he
should
know
the
fertility
of
every
valley
as
well
as
the
hind
who
ploughs
it
and
be
able
to
describe
or
if
it
is
required
to
give
thee
an
exact
map
of
all
the
plains
and
defiles
the
forts
the
acclivities
the
woods
and
morasses
thro
and
by
which
his
army
is
to
march
he
should
know
their
produce
their
plants
their
minerals
their
waters
their
animals
their
seasons
their
climates
their
heats
and
cold
their
inhabitants
their
customs
their
language
their
policy
and
even
their
religion
is
it
else
to
be
conceived
corporal
continued
my
uncle

rising
up

continued
my
uncle
toby
sitting
down
again
coolly
in
his
that
of
all
others
it
seems
a
science
which
the
soldier
might
best
spare
was
it
not
for
the
lights
which
that
science
must
one
day
give
him
in
determining
the
invention
of
powder
the
furious
execution
of
which
renversing
every
thing
like
thunder
before
it
has
become
a
new
aera
to
us
of
military
improvements
changing
so
totally
the
nature
of
attacks
and
defences
both
by
sea
and
land
and
awakening
so
much
art
and
skill
in
doing
it
that
the
world
can
not
be
too
exact
in
ascertaining
the
precise
time
of
its
discovery
or
too
inquisitive
in
knowing
what
great
man
was
the
discoverer
and
what
occasions
gave
birth
to
it
i
am
far
from
controverting
continued
my
uncle
toby
what
historians
agree
in
that
in
the
year
of
our
lord
under
the
reign
of
wencelaus
son
of
charles
the
fourth
a
certain
priest
whose
name
was
schwartz
shew
the
use
of
powder
to
the
venetians
in
their
wars
against
the
genoese
but
is
certain
he
was
not
the
first
because
if
we
are
to
believe
don
pedro
the
bishop
of
leon
how
came
priests
and
bishops
an
please
your
honour
to
trouble
their
heads
so
much
about
god
knows
said
my
uncle
toby
his
providence
brings
good
out
of
every
thing
and
he
avers
in
his
chronicle
of
king
alphonsus
who
reduced
toledo
that
in
the
year
which
was
full
years
before
that
time
the
secret
of
powder
was
well
known
and
employed
with
success
both
by
moors
and
christians
not
only
in
their
at
that
period
but
in
many
of
their
most
memorable
sieges
in
spain
and
barbary
and
all
the
world
knows
that
friar
bacon
had
wrote
expressly
about
it
and
had
generously
given
the
world
a
receipt
to
make
it
by
above
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
before
even
schwartz
was
born
and
that
the
chinese
added
my
uncle
toby
embarrass
us
and
all
accounts
of
it
still
more
by
boasting
of
the
invention
some
hundreds
of
years
even
before
him
they
are
a
pack
of
liars
i
believe
cried
trim
they
are
somehow
or
other
deceived
said
my
uncle
toby
in
this
matter
as
is
plain
to
me
from
the
present
miserable
state
of
military
architecture
amongst
them
which
consists
of
nothing
more
than
a
fosse
with
a
brick
wall
without
flanks
and
for
what
they
gave
us
as
a
bastion
at
each
angle
of
it
is
so
barbarously
constructed
that
it
looks
for
all
the
world
like
one
of
my
seven
castles
an
please
your
honour
quoth
trim
my
uncle
toby
tho
in
the
utmost
distress
for
a
comparison
most
courteously
refused
trim
offer
till
trim
telling
him
he
had
half
a
dozen
more
in
bohemia
which
he
knew
not
how
to
get
off
his
hands
my
uncle
toby
was
so
touch
with
the
pleasantry
of
heart
of
the
corporal
that
he
discontinued
his
dissertation
upon
and
begged
the
corporal
forthwith
to
go
on
with
his
story
of
the
king
of
bohemia
and
his
seven
castles
the
story
of
the
king
of
bohemia
and
his
seven
castles
continued
this
unfortunate
king
of
bohemia
said
trim
was
he
unfortunate
then
cried
my
uncle
toby
for
he
had
been
so
wrapt
up
in
his
dissertation
upon
and
other
military
affairs
that
tho
he
had
desired
the
corporal
to
go
on
yet
the
many
interruptions
he
had
given
dwelt
not
so
strong
upon
his
fancy
as
to
account
for
the
epithet
was
he
unfortunate
then
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
pathetically
the
corporal
wishing
first
the
word
and
all
its
synonimas
at
the
devil
forthwith
began
to
run
back
in
his
mind
the
principal
events
in
the
king
of
bohemia
story
from
every
one
of
which
it
appearing
that
he
was
the
most
fortunate
man
that
ever
existed
in
the
world
it
put
the
corporal
to
a
stand
for
not
caring
to
retract
his
epithet
and
less
to
explain
it
and
least
of
all
to
twist
his
tale
like
men
of
lore
to
serve
a
system
he
looked
up
in
my
uncle
toby
face
for
assistance
but
seeing
it
was
the
very
thing
my
uncle
toby
sat
in
expectation
of
himself
after
a
hum
and
a
haw
he
went
on
the
king
of
bohemia
an
please
your
honour
replied
the
corporal
was
unfortunate
as
thus
that
taking
great
pleasure
and
delight
in
navigation
and
all
sort
of
sea
affairs
and
there
happening
throughout
the
whole
kingdom
of
bohemia
to
be
no
town
whatever
how
the
duce
should
there
trim
cried
my
uncle
toby
for
bohemia
being
totally
inland
it
could
have
happen
no
otherwise
it
might
said
trim
if
it
had
pleased
god
my
uncle
toby
never
spoke
of
the
being
and
natural
attributes
of
god
but
with
diffidence
and
hesitation
i
believe
not
replied
my
uncle
toby
after
some
pause
for
being
inland
as
i
said
and
having
silesia
and
moravia
to
the
east
lusatia
and
upper
saxony
to
the
north
franconia
to
the
west
and
bavaria
to
the
south
bohemia
could
not
have
been
propell
to
the
sea
without
ceasing
to
be
bohemia
nor
could
the
sea
on
the
other
hand
have
come
up
to
bohemia
without
overflowing
a
great
part
of
germany
and
destroying
millions
of
unfortunate
inhabitants
who
could
make
no
defence
against
it
scandalous
cried
trim
which
would
bespeak
added
my
uncle
toby
mildly
such
a
want
of
compassion
in
him
who
is
the
father
of
it
that
i
think
trim
the
thing
could
have
happen
no
way
the
corporal
made
the
bow
of
unfeign
conviction
and
went
on
now
the
king
of
bohemia
with
his
queen
and
courtiers
happening
one
fine
summer
evening
to
walk
out
aye
there
the
word
happening
is
right
trim
cried
my
uncle
toby
for
the
king
of
bohemia
and
his
queen
might
have
walk
out
or
let
it
alone
was
a
matter
of
contingency
which
might
happen
or
not
just
as
chance
ordered
it
king
william
was
of
an
opinion
an
please
your
honour
quoth
trim
that
every
thing
was
predestined
for
us
in
this
world
insomuch
that
he
would
often
say
to
his
soldiers
that
ball
had
its
billet
he
was
a
great
man
said
my
uncle
toby
and
i
believe
continued
trim
to
this
day
that
the
shot
which
disabled
me
at
the
battle
of
landen
was
pointed
at
my
knee
for
no
other
purpose
but
to
take
me
out
of
his
service
and
place
me
in
your
honour
where
i
should
be
taken
so
much
better
care
of
in
my
old
age
it
shall
never
trim
be
construed
otherwise
said
my
uncle
toby
the
heart
both
of
the
master
and
the
man
were
alike
subject
to
sudden
a
short
silence
ensued
besides
said
the
corporal
resuming
the
discourse
but
in
a
gayer
accent
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
single
shot
i
had
never
please
your
honour
been
in
love
so
thou
wast
once
in
love
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
smiling
souse
replied
the
corporal
over
head
and
ears
an
please
your
honour
prithee
when
where
and
how
came
it
to
pass
i
never
heard
one
word
of
it
before
quoth
my
uncle
toby
i
dare
say
answered
trim
that
every
drummer
and
serjeant
son
in
the
regiment
knew
of
it
it
high
time
i
should
said
my
uncle
toby
your
honour
remembers
with
concern
said
the
corporal
the
total
rout
and
confusion
of
our
camp
and
army
at
the
affair
of
landen
every
one
was
left
to
shift
for
himself
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
regiments
of
wyndham
lumley
and
galway
which
covered
the
retreat
over
the
bridge
neerspeeken
the
king
himself
could
scarce
have
gained
it
he
was
press
hard
as
your
honour
knows
on
every
side
of
him
gallant
mortal
cried
my
uncle
toby
caught
up
with
enthusiasm
this
moment
now
that
all
is
lost
i
see
him
galloping
across
me
corporal
to
the
left
to
bring
up
the
remains
of
the
english
horse
along
with
him
to
support
the
right
and
tear
the
laurel
from
luxembourg
brows
if
yet
is
possible
i
see
him
with
the
knot
of
his
scarfe
just
shot
off
infusing
fresh
spirits
into
poor
galway
regiment
riding
along
the
line
then
wheeling
about
and
charging
conti
at
the
head
of
it
brave
brave
by
heaven
cried
my
uncle
toby
he
deserves
a
crown
as
richly
as
a
thief
a
halter
shouted
trim
my
uncle
toby
knew
the
corporal
loyalty
otherwise
the
comparison
was
not
at
all
to
his
mind
it
did
not
altogether
strike
the
fancy
when
he
had
made
it
but
it
could
not
be
recall
so
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
proceed
as
the
number
of
wounded
was
prodigious
and
no
one
had
time
to
think
of
any
thing
but
his
own
safety
though
talmash
said
my
uncle
toby
brought
off
the
foot
with
great
prudence
but
i
was
left
upon
the
field
said
the
corporal
thou
wast
so
poor
fellow
replied
my
uncle
toby
so
that
it
was
noon
the
next
day
continued
the
corporal
before
i
was
exchanged
and
put
into
a
cart
with
thirteen
or
fourteen
more
in
order
to
be
convey
to
our
hospital
there
is
no
part
of
the
body
an
please
your
honour
where
a
wound
occasions
more
intolerable
anguish
than
upon
the
knee
except
the
groin
said
my
uncle
toby
an
please
your
honour
replied
the
corporal
the
knee
in
my
opinion
must
certainly
be
the
most
acute
there
being
so
many
tendons
and
d
all
about
it
it
is
for
that
reason
quoth
my
uncle
toby
that
the
groin
is
infinitely
more
sensible
there
being
not
only
as
many
tendons
and
d
for
i
know
their
names
as
little
as
thou
dost
about
it
but
moreover
wadman
who
had
been
all
the
time
in
her
arbour
instantly
her
breath
unpinn
her
mob
at
the
chin
and
stood
upon
one
leg
the
dispute
was
maintained
with
amicable
and
equal
force
betwixt
my
uncle
toby
and
trim
for
some
time
till
trim
at
length
recollecting
that
he
had
often
cried
at
his
master
sufferings
but
never
shed
a
tear
at
his
own
was
for
giving
up
the
point
which
my
uncle
toby
would
not
allow
is
a
proof
of
nothing
trim
said
he
but
the
generosity
of
thy
temper
so
that
whether
the
pain
of
a
wound
in
the
groin
caeteris
paribus
is
greater
than
the
pain
of
a
wound
in
the
knee
or
whether
the
pain
of
a
wound
in
the
knee
is
not
greater
than
the
pain
of
a
wound
in
the
groin
are
points
which
to
this
day
remain
unsettled
chapter
the
anguish
of
my
knee
continued
the
corporal
was
excessive
in
itself
and
the
uneasiness
of
the
cart
with
the
roughness
of
the
roads
which
were
terribly
cut
up
making
bad
still
worse
every
step
was
death
to
me
so
that
with
the
loss
of
blood
and
the
want
of
of
me
and
a
fever
i
felt
coming
on
besides
poor
soul
said
my
uncle
toby
all
together
an
please
your
honour
was
more
than
i
could
sustain
i
was
telling
my
sufferings
to
a
young
woman
at
a
peasant
house
where
our
cart
which
was
the
last
of
the
line
had
halted
they
had
me
in
and
the
young
woman
had
taken
a
cordial
out
of
her
pocket
and
dropp
it
upon
some
sugar
and
seeing
it
had
cheer
me
she
had
given
it
me
a
second
and
a
third
time
so
i
was
telling
her
an
please
your
honour
the
anguish
i
was
in
and
was
saying
it
was
so
intolerable
to
me
that
i
had
much
rather
lie
down
upon
the
bed
turning
my
face
towards
one
which
was
in
the
corner
of
the
room
and
die
than
go
on
when
upon
her
attempting
to
lead
me
to
it
i
fainted
away
in
her
arms
she
was
a
good
soul
as
your
honour
said
the
corporal
wiping
his
eyes
will
hear
i
thought
love
had
been
a
joyous
thing
quoth
my
uncle
toby
is
the
most
serious
thing
an
please
your
honour
sometimes
that
is
in
the
world
by
the
persuasion
of
the
young
woman
continued
the
corporal
the
cart
with
the
wounded
men
set
off
without
me
she
had
assured
them
i
should
expire
immediately
if
i
was
put
into
the
cart
so
when
i
came
to
myself
i
found
myself
in
a
still
quiet
cottage
with
no
one
but
the
young
woman
and
the
peasant
and
his
wife
i
was
laid
across
the
bed
in
the
corner
of
the
room
with
my
wounded
leg
upon
a
chair
and
the
young
woman
beside
me
holding
the
corner
of
her
handkerchief
dipp
in
vinegar
to
my
nose
with
one
hand
and
rubbing
my
temples
with
the
other
i
took
her
at
first
for
the
daughter
of
the
peasant
for
it
was
no
inn
so
had
offer
her
a
little
purse
with
eighteen
florins
which
my
poor
brother
tom
here
trim
wip
his
eyes
had
sent
me
as
a
token
by
a
recruit
just
before
he
set
out
for
lisbon
i
never
told
your
honour
that
piteous
story
yet
here
trim
wiped
his
eyes
a
third
time
the
young
woman
call
the
old
man
and
his
wife
into
the
room
to
shew
them
the
money
in
order
to
gain
me
credit
for
a
bed
and
what
little
necessaries
i
should
want
till
i
should
be
in
a
condition
to
be
got
to
the
hospital
come
then
said
she
tying
up
the
little
purse
i
be
your
banker
but
as
that
office
alone
will
not
keep
me
employ
i
be
your
nurse
too
i
thought
by
her
manner
of
speaking
this
as
well
as
by
her
dress
which
i
then
began
to
consider
more
attentively
that
the
young
woman
could
not
be
the
daughter
of
the
peasant
she
was
in
black
down
to
her
toes
with
her
hair
conceal
under
a
cambric
border
laid
close
to
her
forehead
she
was
one
of
those
kind
of
nuns
an
please
your
honour
of
which
your
honour
knows
there
are
a
good
many
in
flanders
which
they
let
go
loose
by
thy
description
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
i
dare
say
she
was
a
young
beguine
of
which
there
are
none
to
be
found
any
where
but
in
the
spanish
netherlands
except
at
amsterdam
they
differ
from
nuns
in
this
that
they
can
quit
their
cloister
if
they
choose
to
marry
they
visit
and
take
care
of
the
sick
by
profession
i
had
rather
for
my
own
part
they
did
it
out
of
she
often
told
me
quoth
trim
she
did
it
for
the
love
of
christ
i
did
not
like
i
believe
trim
we
are
both
wrong
said
my
uncle
toby
we
ask
yorick
about
it
at
my
brother
shandy
so
put
me
in
mind
added
my
uncle
toby
the
young
beguine
continued
the
corporal
had
scarce
given
herself
time
to
tell
me
would
be
my
nurse
when
she
hastily
turned
about
to
begin
the
office
of
one
and
prepare
something
for
me
and
in
a
short
time
though
i
thought
it
a
long
one
she
came
back
with
flannels
and
having
fomented
my
knee
soundly
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
made
me
a
thin
bason
of
gruel
for
my
supper
she
wish
me
rest
and
promised
to
be
with
me
early
in
the
she
wish
me
please
your
honour
what
was
not
to
be
had
my
fever
ran
very
high
that
night
her
figure
made
sad
disturbance
within
me
i
was
every
moment
cutting
the
world
in
two
to
give
her
half
of
it
and
every
moment
was
i
crying
that
i
had
nothing
but
a
knapsack
and
eighteen
florins
to
share
with
her
the
whole
night
long
was
the
fair
beguine
like
an
angel
close
by
my
holding
back
my
curtain
and
offering
me
cordials
and
i
was
only
awakened
from
my
dream
by
her
coming
there
at
the
hour
promised
and
giving
them
in
reality
in
truth
she
was
scarce
ever
from
me
and
so
accustomed
was
i
to
receive
life
from
her
hands
that
my
heart
sickened
and
i
lost
colour
when
she
left
the
room
and
yet
continued
the
corporal
making
one
of
the
strangest
reflections
upon
it
in
the
world
was
not
love
for
during
the
three
weeks
she
was
almost
constantly
with
me
fomenting
my
knee
with
her
hand
night
and
day
i
can
honestly
say
an
please
your
honour
that
once
that
was
very
odd
trim
quoth
my
uncle
toby
i
think
so
too
said
wadman
it
never
did
said
the
corporal
chapter
but
is
no
marvel
continued
the
corporal
seeing
my
uncle
toby
musing
upon
it
for
love
an
please
your
honour
is
exactly
like
war
in
this
that
a
soldier
though
he
has
escaped
three
weeks
complete
night
may
nevertheless
be
shot
through
his
heart
on
sunday
morning
it
happened
so
here
an
please
your
honour
with
this
difference
only
that
it
was
on
sunday
in
the
afternoon
when
i
fell
in
love
all
at
once
with
a
sisserara
it
burst
upon
me
an
please
your
honour
like
a
bomb
scarce
giving
me
time
to
say
bless
me
i
thought
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
a
man
never
fell
in
love
so
very
suddenly
yes
an
please
your
honour
if
he
is
in
the
way
of
it
replied
trim
i
prithee
quoth
my
uncle
toby
inform
me
how
this
matter
happened
with
all
pleasure
said
the
corporal
making
a
bow
chapter
i
had
escaped
continued
the
corporal
all
that
time
from
falling
in
love
and
had
gone
on
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
had
it
not
been
predestined
otherwise
there
is
no
resisting
our
fate
it
was
on
a
sunday
in
the
afternoon
as
i
told
your
honour
the
old
man
and
his
wife
had
walked
out
every
thing
was
still
and
hush
as
midnight
about
the
house
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
duck
or
a
duckling
about
the
yard
when
the
fair
beguine
came
in
to
see
me
my
wound
was
then
in
a
fair
way
of
doing
well
the
inflammation
had
been
gone
off
for
some
time
but
it
was
succeeded
with
an
itching
both
above
and
below
my
knee
so
insufferable
that
i
had
not
shut
my
eyes
the
whole
night
for
it
let
me
see
it
said
she
kneeling
down
upon
the
ground
parallel
to
my
knee
and
laying
her
hand
upon
the
part
below
it
it
only
wants
rubbing
a
little
said
the
beguine
so
covering
it
with
the
she
began
with
the
of
her
right
hand
to
rub
under
my
knee
guiding
her
backwards
and
forwards
by
the
edge
of
the
flannel
which
kept
on
the
dressing
in
five
or
six
minutes
i
felt
slightly
the
end
of
her
second
finger
and
presently
it
was
laid
flat
with
the
other
and
she
continued
rubbing
in
that
way
round
and
round
for
a
good
while
it
then
came
into
my
head
that
i
should
fall
in
love
i
blush
when
i
saw
how
white
a
hand
she
had
i
shall
never
an
please
your
honour
behold
another
hand
so
white
whilst
i
live
not
in
that
place
said
my
uncle
toby
though
it
was
the
most
serious
despair
in
nature
to
the
corporal
he
could
not
forbear
smiling
the
young
beguine
continued
the
corporal
perceiving
it
was
of
great
service
to
me
from
rubbing
for
some
time
with
two
fingers
proceeded
to
rub
at
length
with
three
till
by
little
and
little
she
brought
down
the
fourth
and
then
rubb
with
her
whole
hand
i
will
never
say
another
word
an
please
your
honour
upon
hands
again
but
it
was
softer
than
sattin
prithee
trim
commend
it
as
much
as
thou
wilt
said
my
uncle
toby
i
shall
hear
thy
story
with
the
more
delight
the
corporal
thank
his
master
most
unfeignedly
but
having
nothing
to
say
upon
the
hand
but
the
same
over
again
he
proceeded
to
the
effects
of
it
the
fair
beguine
said
the
corporal
continued
rubbing
with
her
whole
hand
under
my
knee
till
i
fear
her
zeal
would
weary
her
would
do
a
thousand
times
more
said
she
the
love
of
christ
in
saying
which
she
pass
her
hand
across
the
flannel
to
the
part
above
my
knee
which
i
had
equally
complain
of
and
rubb
it
also
i
perceiv
then
i
was
beginning
to
be
in
love
as
she
continued
i
felt
it
spread
from
under
her
hand
an
please
your
honour
to
every
part
of
my
frame
the
more
she
rubb
and
the
longer
strokes
she
took
the
more
the
fire
kindled
in
my
veins
till
at
length
by
two
or
three
strokes
longer
than
the
rest
my
passion
rose
to
the
highest
pitch
i
seiz
her
hand
and
then
thou
it
to
thy
lips
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
and
madest
a
speech
whether
the
corporal
amour
terminated
precisely
in
the
way
my
uncle
toby
described
it
is
not
material
it
is
enough
that
it
contained
in
it
the
essence
of
all
the
love
romances
which
ever
have
been
wrote
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
chapter
as
soon
as
the
corporal
had
finished
the
story
of
his
amour
or
rather
my
uncle
toby
for
him
wadman
silently
sallied
forth
from
her
arbour
replaced
the
pin
in
her
mob
pass
the
wicker
gate
and
advanced
slowly
towards
my
uncle
toby
the
disposition
which
trim
had
made
in
my
uncle
toby
mind
was
too
favourable
a
crisis
to
be
let
slipp
the
attack
was
determin
upon
it
was
facilitated
still
more
by
my
uncle
toby
having
ordered
the
corporal
to
wheel
off
the
shovel
the
spade
the
the
picquets
and
other
military
stores
which
lay
scatter
upon
the
ground
where
dunkirk
stood
the
corporal
had
march
the
field
was
clear
now
consider
sir
what
nonsense
it
is
either
in
fighting
or
writing
or
any
thing
else
whether
in
rhyme
to
it
or
not
which
a
man
has
occasion
to
do
to
act
by
plan
for
if
ever
plan
independent
of
all
circumstances
deserved
registering
in
letters
of
gold
i
mean
in
the
archives
of
gotham
it
was
certainly
the
plan
of
wadman
attack
of
my
uncle
toby
in
his
by
plan
now
the
plan
hanging
up
in
it
at
this
juncture
being
the
plan
of
dunkirk
and
the
tale
of
dunkirk
a
tale
of
relaxation
it
opposed
every
impression
she
could
make
and
besides
could
she
have
gone
upon
it
the
manoeuvre
of
fingers
and
hands
in
the
attack
of
the
was
so
outdone
by
that
of
the
fair
beguine
in
trim
story
that
just
then
that
particular
attack
however
successful
before
became
the
most
heartless
attack
that
could
be
made
o
let
woman
alone
for
this
wadman
had
scarce
open
the
when
her
genius
sported
with
the
change
of
circumstances
she
formed
a
new
attack
in
a
moment
chapter
i
am
half
distracted
captain
shandy
said
wadman
holding
up
her
cambrick
handkerchief
to
her
left
eye
as
she
approach
the
door
of
my
uncle
toby
a
mote
or
sand
or
something
i
know
not
what
has
got
into
this
eye
of
mine
do
look
into
it
it
is
not
in
the
white
in
saying
which
wadman
edged
herself
close
in
beside
my
uncle
toby
and
squeezing
herself
down
upon
the
corner
of
his
bench
she
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
doing
it
without
rising
up
do
look
into
it
said
she
honest
soul
thou
didst
look
into
it
with
as
much
innocency
of
heart
as
ever
child
look
into
a
and
as
much
a
sin
to
have
hurt
thee
if
a
man
will
be
peeping
of
his
own
accord
into
things
of
that
nature
i
nothing
to
say
to
it
my
uncle
toby
never
did
and
i
will
answer
for
him
that
he
would
have
sat
quietly
upon
a
sofa
from
june
to
january
which
you
know
takes
in
both
the
hot
and
cold
months
with
an
eye
as
fine
as
the
thracian
rodope

quin
i
know
not
who
besides
him
without
being
able
to
tell
whether
it
was
a
black
or
blue
one
the
difficulty
was
to
get
my
uncle
toby
to
look
at
one
at
all
is
surmounted
and
i
see
him
yonder
with
his
pipe
pendulous
in
his
hand
and
the
ashes
falling
out
of
it
looking
and
looking
then
rubbing
his
eyes
and
looking
again
with
twice
the
that
ever
galileo
look
for
a
spot
in
the
sun
in
vain
for
by
all
the
powers
which
animate
the
organ
widow
left
eye
shines
this
moment
as
lucid
as
her
right
there
is
neither
mote
or
sand
or
dust
or
chaff
or
speck
or
particle
of
opake
matter
floating
in
it
there
is
nothing
my
dear
paternal
uncle
but
one
lambent
delicious
fire
furtively
shooting
out
from
every
part
of
it
in
all
directions
into
thine
if
thou
lookest
uncle
toby
in
search
of
this
mote
one
moment
longer
thou
art
undone
chapter
an
eye
is
for
all
the
world
exactly
like
a
cannon
in
this
respect
that
it
is
not
so
much
the
eye
or
the
cannon
in
themselves
as
it
is
the
carriage
of
the
eye
and
the
carriage
of
the
cannon
by
which
both
the
one
and
the
other
are
enabled
to
do
so
much
execution
i
do
think
the
comparison
a
bad
one
however
as
is
made
and
placed
at
the
head
of
the
chapter
as
much
for
use
as
ornament
all
i
desire
in
return
is
that
whenever
i
speak
of
wadman
eyes
except
once
in
the
next
period
that
you
keep
it
in
your
fancy
i
protest
madam
said
my
uncle
toby
i
can
see
nothing
whatever
in
your
eye
it
is
not
in
the
white
said
wadman
my
uncle
toby
look
with
might
and
main
into
the
pupil
now
of
all
the
eyes
which
ever
were
created
from
your
own
madam
up
to
those
of
venus
herself
which
certainly
were
as
venereal
a
pair
of
eyes
as
ever
stood
in
a
head
there
never
was
an
eye
of
them
all
so
fitted
to
rob
my
uncle
toby
of
his
repose
as
the
very
eye
at
which
he
was
looking
it
was
not
madam
a
rolling
eye
a
romping
or
a
wanton
one
nor
was
it
an
eye
sparkling
petulant
or
imperious
of
high
claims
and
terrifying
exactions
which
would
have
curdled
at
once
that
milk
of
human
nature
of
which
my
uncle
toby
was
made
up
but
was
an
eye
full
of
gentle
salutations
and
soft
responses
speaking
not
like
the
trumpet
stop
of
some
organ
in
which
many
an
eye
i
talk
to
holds
coarse
converse
but
whispering
soft
like
the
last
low
accent
of
an
expiring
saint
can
you
live
comfortless
captain
shandy
and
alone
without
a
bosom
to
lean
your
head
on
or
trust
your
cares
to
it
was
an
eye
but
i
shall
be
in
love
with
it
myself
if
i
say
another
word
about
it
it
did
my
uncle
toby
business
chapter
there
is
nothing
shews
the
character
of
my
father
and
my
uncle
toby
in
a
more
entertaining
light
than
their
different
manner
of
deportment
under
the
same
accident
for
i
call
not
love
a
misfortune
from
a
persuasion
that
a
man
heart
is
ever
the
better
for
it
great
god
what
must
my
uncle
toby
have
been
when
was
all
benignity
without
it
my
father
as
appears
from
many
of
his
papers
was
very
subject
to
this
passion
before
he
married
but
from
a
little
subacid
kind
of
drollish
impatience
in
his
nature
whenever
it
befell
him
he
would
never
submit
to
it
like
a
christian
but
would
pish
and
huff
and
bounce
and
kick
and
play
the
devil
and
write
the
bitterest
philippicks
against
the
eye
that
ever
man
wrote
there
is
one
in
verse
upon
somebody
eye
or
other
that
for
two
or
three
nights
together
had
put
him
by
his
rest
which
in
his
first
transport
of
resentment
against
it
he
begins
thus
devil
is
and
mischief
such
doth
work
as
never
yet
did
pagan
jew
or
turk
this
will
be
printed
with
my
father
life
of
socrates
in
short
during
the
whole
paroxism
my
father
was
all
abuse
and
foul
language
approaching
rather
towards
malediction
only
he
did
not
do
it
with
as
much
method
as
ernulphus
he
was
too
impetuous
nor
with
ernulphus
policy
for
tho
my
father
with
the
most
intolerant
spirit
would
curse
both
this
and
that
and
every
thing
under
heaven
which
was
either
aiding
or
abetting
to
his
love
yet
never
concluded
his
chapter
of
curses
upon
it
without
cursing
himself
in
at
the
bargain
as
one
of
the
most
egregious
fools
and
he
would
say
that
ever
was
let
loose
in
the
world
my
uncle
toby
on
the
contrary
took
it
like
a
lamb
sat
still
and
let
the
poison
work
in
his
veins
without
resistance
in
the
sharpest
exacerbations
of
his
wound
like
that
on
his
groin
he
never
dropt
one
fretful
or
discontented
word
he
blamed
neither
heaven
nor
earth
or
thought
or
spoke
an
injurious
thing
of
any
body
or
any
part
of
it
he
sat
solitary
and
pensive
with
his
pipe
looking
at
his
lame
leg
then
whiffing
out
a
sentimental
heigh
ho
which
mixing
with
the
smoke
incommoded
no
one
mortal
he
took
it
like
a
lamb
i
say
in
truth
he
had
mistook
it
at
first
for
having
taken
a
ride
with
my
father
that
very
morning
to
save
if
possible
a
beautiful
wood
which
the
dean
and
chapter
were
hewing
down
to
give
to
the
poor
shandy
must
mean
the
poor
in
spirit
inasmuch
as
they
divided
the
money
amongst
themselves
which
said
wood
being
in
full
view
of
my
uncle
house
and
of
singular
service
to
him
in
his
description
of
the
battle
of
wynnendale
by
trotting
on
too
hastily
to
save
it
upon
an
uneasy
saddle
worse
horse
c
it
had
so
happened
that
the
serous
part
of
the
blood
had
got
betwixt
the
two
skins
in
the
nethermost
part
of
my
uncle
toby
the
first
shootings
of
which
as
my
uncle
toby
had
no
experience
of
love
he
had
taken
for
a
part
of
the
passion
till
the
blister
breaking
in
the
one
case
and
the
other
remaining
my
uncle
toby
was
presently
convinced
that
his
wound
was
not
a
wound
but
that
it
had
gone
to
his
heart
chapter
the
world
is
ashamed
of
being
virtuous
my
uncle
toby
knew
little
of
the
world
and
therefore
when
he
felt
he
was
in
love
with
widow
wadman
he
had
no
conception
that
the
thing
was
any
more
to
be
made
a
mystery
of
than
if
wadman
had
given
him
a
cut
with
a
gap
knife
across
his
finger
had
it
been
otherwise
yet
as
he
ever
look
upon
trim
as
a
humble
friend
and
saw
fresh
reasons
every
day
of
his
life
to
treat
him
as
such
it
would
have
made
no
variation
in
the
manner
in
which
he
informed
him
of
the
affair
am
in
love
corporal
quoth
my
uncle
toby
chapter
in
love
said
the
corporal
your
honour
was
very
well
the
day
before
yesterday
when
i
was
telling
your
honour
of
the
story
of
the
king
of
bohemia
bohemia
said
my
uncle
toby
musing
a
long
time
what
became
of
that
story
trim
we
lost
it
an
please
your
honour
somehow
betwixt
us
but
your
honour
was
as
free
from
love
then
as
i
am
was
just
whilst
thou
off
with
the
with
wadman
quoth
my
uncle
toby
she
has
left
a
ball
here
added
my
uncle
toby
pointing
to
his
breast
she
can
no
more
an
please
your
honour
stand
a
siege
than
she
can
fly
cried
the
corporal
but
as
we
are
neighbours
trim
the
best
way
i
think
is
to
let
her
know
it
civilly
first
quoth
my
uncle
toby
now
if
i
might
presume
said
the
corporal
to
differ
from
your
honour
why
else
do
i
talk
to
thee
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
mildly
then
i
would
begin
an
please
your
honour
with
making
a
good
thundering
attack
upon
her
in
return
and
telling
her
civilly
afterwards
for
if
she
knows
any
thing
of
your
honour
being
in
love
before
hand
help
her
she
knows
no
more
at
present
of
it
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
than
the
child
unborn
precious
souls
wadman
had
told
it
with
all
its
circumstances
to
bridget
hours
before
and
was
at
that
very
moment
sitting
in
council
with
her
touching
some
slight
misgivings
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
the
affairs
which
the
devil
who
never
lies
dead
in
a
ditch
had
put
into
her
head
before
he
would
allow
half
time
to
get
quietly
through
her
te
deum
i
am
terribly
afraid
said
widow
wadman
in
case
i
should
marry
him
bridget
that
the
poor
captain
will
not
enjoy
his
health
with
the
monstrous
wound
upon
his
groin
it
may
not
madam
be
so
very
large
replied
bridget
as
you
think
and
i
believe
besides
added
she
that
is
dried
up
i
could
like
to
know
merely
for
his
sake
said
wadman
we
know
and
long
and
the
broad
of
it
in
ten
days
answered
bridget
for
whilst
the
captain
is
paying
his
addresses
to
you
confident
mr
trim
will
be
for
making
love
to
me
and
i
let
him
as
much
as
he
will
added
bridget
to
get
it
all
out
of
him
the
measures
were
taken
at
once
and
my
uncle
toby
and
the
corporal
went
on
with
theirs
now
quoth
the
corporal
setting
his
left
hand
and
giving
such
a
flourish
with
his
right
as
just
promised
success
and
no
more
if
your
honour
will
give
me
leave
to
lay
down
the
plan
of
this
attack
thou
wilt
please
me
by
it
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
exceedingly
and
as
i
foresee
thou
must
act
in
it
as
my
aid
de
camp
here
a
crown
corporal
to
begin
with
to
steep
thy
commission
then
an
please
your
honour
said
the
corporal
making
a
bow
first
for
his
commission
we
will
begin
with
getting
your
honour
laced
clothes
out
of
the
great
to
be
well
air
and
have
the
blue
and
gold
taken
up
at
the
sleeves
and
i
put
your
white
fresh
into
pipes
and
send
for
a
taylor
to
have
your
honour
thin
scarlet
breeches
turn
i
had
better
take
the
red
plush
ones
quoth
my
uncle
toby
they
will
be
too
clumsy
said
the
corporal
chapter
thou
wilt
get
a
brush
and
a
little
chalk
to
my
sword
be
only
in
your
honour
way
replied
trim
chapter
but
your
honour
two
razors
shall
be
new
set
and
i
will
get
my
montero
cap
furbish
up
and
put
on
poor
lieutenant
le
regimental
coat
which
your
honour
gave
me
to
wear
for
his
sake
and
as
soon
as
your
honour
is
clean
shaved
and
has
got
your
clean
shirt
on
with
your
blue
and
gold
or
your
fine
scarlet
sometimes
one
and
sometimes
and
every
thing
is
ready
for
the
attack
we
march
up
boldly
as
if
was
to
the
face
of
a
bastion
and
whilst
your
honour
engages
wadman
in
the
parlour
to
the
right
i
attack
bridget
in
the
kitchen
to
the
left
and
having
seiz
the
pass
i
answer
for
it
said
the
corporal
snapping
his
fingers
over
his
head
that
the
day
is
our
own
i
wish
i
may
but
manage
it
right
said
my
uncle
toby
but
i
declare
corporal
i
had
rather
march
up
to
the
very
edge
of
a
trench
a
woman
is
quite
a
different
thing
said
the
corporal
i
suppose
so
quoth
my
uncle
toby
chapter
if
any
thing
in
this
world
which
my
father
said
could
have
provoked
my
uncle
toby
during
the
time
he
was
in
love
it
was
the
perverse
use
my
father
was
always
making
of
an
expression
of
hilarion
the
hermit
who
in
speaking
of
his
abstinence
his
watchings
flagellations
and
other
instrumental
parts
of
his
religion
would
say
tho
with
more
facetiousness
than
became
an
hermit
they
were
the
means
he
used
to
make
his
ass
meaning
his
body
leave
off
kicking
it
pleased
my
father
well
it
was
not
only
a
laconick
way
of
expressing
but
of
libelling
at
the
same
time
the
desires
and
appetites
of
the
lower
part
of
us
so
that
for
many
years
of
my
life
was
his
constant
mode
of
expression
he
never
used
the
word
passions
once
but
ass
always
instead
of
them
so
that
he
might
be
said
truly
to
have
been
upon
the
bones
or
the
back
of
his
own
ass
or
else
of
some
other
man
during
all
that
time
i
must
here
observe
to
you
the
difference
betwixt
my
father
ass
and
my
in
order
to
keep
characters
as
separate
as
may
be
in
our
fancies
as
we
go
along
for
my
if
you
recollect
a
little
is
no
way
a
vicious
beast
he
has
scarce
one
hair
or
lineament
of
the
ass
about
him
is
the
sporting
little
which
carries
you
out
for
the
present
hour
a
maggot
a
butterfly
a
picture
a
fiddlestick
an
uncle
siege
or
an
any
thing
which
a
man
makes
a
shift
to
get
on
to
canter
it
away
from
the
cares
and
solicitudes
of
life
is
as
useful
a
beast
as
is
in
the
whole
creation
nor
do
i
really
see
how
the
world
could
do
without
it
but
for
my
father
ass
oh
mount
him
mount
him
mount
him
three
times
is
it
not
mount
him
not
is
a
beast
concupiscent
and
foul
befal
the
man
who
does
not
hinder
him
from
kicking
chapter
well
dear
brother
toby
said
my
father
upon
his
first
seeing
him
after
he
fell
in
love
and
how
goes
it
with
your
asse
now
my
uncle
toby
thinking
more
of
the
part
where
he
had
had
the
blister
than
of
hilarion
metaphor
and
our
preconceptions
having
you
know
as
great
a
power
over
the
sounds
of
words
as
the
shapes
of
things
he
had
imagined
that
my
father
who
was
not
very
ceremonious
in
his
choice
of
words
had
enquired
after
the
part
by
its
proper
name
so
notwithstanding
my
mother
doctor
slop
and
yorick
were
sitting
in
the
parlour
he
thought
it
rather
civil
to
conform
to
the
term
my
father
had
made
use
of
than
not
when
a
man
is
hemm
in
by
two
indecorums
and
must
commit
one
of
i
always
observe
let
him
chuse
which
he
will
the
world
will
blame
him
so
i
should
not
be
astonished
if
it
blames
my
uncle
toby
my
quoth
my
uncle
toby
is
much
better
brother
shandy
my
father
had
formed
great
expectations
from
his
asse
in
this
onset
and
would
have
brought
him
on
again
but
doctor
slop
setting
up
an
intemperate
laugh
and
my
mother
crying
out
l
bless
us
it
drove
my
asse
off
the
field
and
the
laugh
then
becoming
general
there
was
no
bringing
him
back
to
the
charge
for
some
time
and
so
the
discourse
went
on
without
him
every
body
said
my
mother
says
you
are
in
love
brother
toby
and
we
hope
it
is
true
i
am
as
much
in
love
sister
i
believe
replied
my
uncle
toby
as
any
man
usually
is
humph
said
my
father
and
when
did
you
know
it
quoth
my
mother
when
the
blister
broke
replied
my
uncle
toby
my
uncle
toby
reply
put
my
father
into
good
temper
so
he
charg
foot
chapter
as
the
ancients
agree
brother
toby
said
my
father
that
there
are
two
different
and
distinct
kinds
of
love
according
to
the
different
parts
which
are
affected
by
it
the
brain
or
liver
i
think
when
a
man
is
in
love
it
behoves
him
a
little
to
consider
which
of
the
two
he
is
fallen
into
what
signifies
it
brother
shandy
replied
my
uncle
toby
which
of
the
two
it
is
provided
it
will
but
make
a
man
marry
and
love
his
wife
and
get
a
few
children
a
few
children
cried
my
father
rising
out
of
his
chair
and
looking
full
in
my
mother
face
as
he
forced
his
way
betwixt
her
and
doctor
slop
a
few
children
cried
my
father
repeating
my
uncle
toby
words
as
he
walk
to
and
fro
not
my
dear
brother
toby
cried
my
father
recovering
himself
all
at
once
and
coming
close
up
to
the
back
of
my
uncle
toby
chair
not
that
i
should
be
sorry
hadst
thou
a
score
on
the
contrary
i
should
rejoice
and
be
as
kind
toby
to
every
one
of
them
as
a
father
my
uncle
toby
stole
his
hand
unperceived
behind
his
chair
to
give
my
father
a
squeeze
nay
moreover
continued
he
keeping
hold
of
my
uncle
toby
hand
so
much
dost
thou
possess
my
dear
toby
of
the
milk
of
human
nature
and
so
little
of
its
asperities
is
piteous
the
world
is
not
peopled
by
creatures
which
resemble
thee
and
was
i
an
asiatic
monarch
added
my
father
heating
himself
with
his
new
project
i
would
oblige
thee
provided
it
would
not
impair
thy
strength
or
dry
up
thy
radical
moisture
too
fast
or
weaken
thy
memory
or
fancy
brother
toby
which
these
gymnics
inordinately
taken
are
apt
to
do
else
dear
toby
i
would
procure
thee
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
my
empire
and
i
would
oblige
thee
nolens
volens
to
beget
for
me
one
subject
every
month
as
my
father
pronounced
the
last
word
of
the
sentence
my
mother
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
now
i
would
not
quoth
my
uncle
toby
get
a
child
nolens
volens
that
is
whether
i
would
or
no
to
please
the
greatest
prince
upon
earth
and
be
cruel
in
me
brother
toby
to
compel
thee
said
my
father
but
is
a
case
put
to
shew
thee
that
it
is
not
thy
begetting
a
child
in
case
thou
be
able
but
the
system
of
love
and
marriage
thou
goest
upon
which
i
would
set
thee
right
in
there
is
at
least
said
yorick
a
great
deal
of
reason
and
plain
sense
in
captain
shandy
opinion
of
love
and
is
amongst
the
hours
of
my
life
which
i
have
to
answer
for
that
i
have
read
so
many
flourishing
poets
and
rhetoricians
in
my
time
from
whom
i
never
could
extract
so
much
i
wish
yorick
said
my
father
you
had
read
plato
for
there
you
would
have
learnt
that
there
are
two
loves
i
know
there
were
two
religions
replied
yorick
amongst
the
ancients
one
for
the
vulgar
and
another
for
the
learned
but
i
think
one
love
might
have
served
both
of
them
very
well
i
could
not
replied
my
father
and
for
the
same
reasons
for
of
these
loves
according
to
ficinus
comment
upon
velasius
the
one
is
rational
the
other
is
natural
the
first
ancient
without
mother
where
venus
had
nothing
to
do
the
second
begotten
of
jupiter
and
dione
pray
brother
quoth
my
uncle
toby
what
has
a
man
who
believes
in
god
to
do
with
this
my
father
could
not
stop
to
answer
for
fear
of
breaking
the
thread
of
his
discourse
this
latter
continued
he
partakes
wholly
of
the
nature
of
venus
the
first
which
is
the
golden
chain
let
down
from
heaven
excites
to
love
heroic
which
comprehends
in
it
and
excites
to
the
desire
of
philosophy
and
truth
the
second
excites
to
desire
simply
i
think
the
procreation
of
children
as
beneficial
to
the
world
said
yorick
as
the
finding
out
the
longitude
to
be
sure
said
my
mother
love
keeps
peace
in
the
world
in
the
house
my
dear
i
own
it
replenishes
the
earth
said
my
mother
but
it
keeps
heaven
empty
my
dear
replied
my
father
is
virginity
cried
slop
triumphantly
which
fills
paradise
well
push
nun
quoth
my
father
chapter
my
father
had
such
a
skirmishing
cutting
kind
of
a
slashing
way
with
him
in
his
disputations
thrusting
and
ripping
and
giving
every
one
a
stroke
to
remember
him
by
in
his
turn
that
if
there
were
twenty
people
in
company
in
less
than
half
an
hour
he
was
sure
to
have
every
one
of
against
him
what
did
not
a
little
contribute
to
leave
him
thus
without
an
ally
was
that
if
there
was
any
one
post
more
untenable
than
the
rest
he
would
be
sure
to
throw
himself
into
it
and
to
do
him
justice
when
he
was
once
there
he
would
defend
it
so
gallantly
that
have
been
a
concern
either
to
a
brave
man
or
a
one
to
have
seen
him
driven
out
yorick
for
this
reason
though
he
would
often
attack
him
yet
could
never
bear
to
do
it
with
all
his
force
doctor
slop
virginity
in
the
close
of
the
last
chapter
had
got
him
for
once
on
the
right
side
of
the
rampart
and
he
was
beginning
to
blow
up
all
the
convents
in
christendom
about
slop
ears
when
corporal
trim
came
into
the
parlour
to
inform
my
uncle
toby
that
his
thin
scarlet
breeches
in
which
the
attack
was
to
be
made
upon
wadman
would
not
do
for
that
the
taylor
in
ripping
them
up
in
order
to
turn
them
had
found
they
had
been
turn
before
then
turn
them
again
brother
said
my
father
rapidly
for
there
will
be
many
a
turning
of
yet
before
all
done
in
the
affair
they
are
as
rotten
as
dirt
said
the
corporal
then
by
all
means
said
my
father
bespeak
a
new
pair
brother
for
though
i
know
continued
my
father
turning
himself
to
the
company
that
widow
wadman
has
been
deeply
in
love
with
my
brother
toby
for
many
years
and
has
used
every
art
and
circumvention
of
woman
to
outwit
him
into
the
same
passion
yet
now
that
she
has
caught
him
her
fever
will
be
pass
its
height
she
has
gained
her
point
in
this
case
continued
my
father
which
plato
i
am
persuaded
never
thought
of
love
you
see
is
not
so
much
a
sentiment
as
a
situation
into
which
a
man
enters
as
my
brother
toby
would
do
into
a
corps
no
matter
whether
he
loves
the
service
or
no
being
once
in
it
he
acts
as
if
he
did
and
takes
every
step
to
shew
himself
a
man
of
prowesse
the
hypothesis
like
the
rest
of
my
father
was
plausible
enough
and
my
uncle
toby
had
but
a
single
word
to
object
to
it
in
which
trim
stood
ready
to
second
him
but
my
father
had
not
drawn
his
conclusion
for
this
reason
continued
my
father
stating
the
case
over
again
notwithstanding
all
the
world
knows
that
wadman
affects
my
brother
toby
and
my
brother
toby
contrariwise
affects
wadman
and
no
obstacle
in
nature
to
forbid
the
music
striking
up
this
very
night
yet
will
i
answer
for

interrogatively
in
trim

would
lay
my

i
once
told
you

his
constant
wager
and
having
furbish
it
up
that
very
night
in
order
to
go
upon
the
attack
it
made
the
odds
look
more
considerable
i
would
lay

your
honour

continued
trim
making
a
bow
to
offer
a
wager
before
your
honours
there
is
nothing
improper
in
it
said
my
father
is
a
mode
of
expression
for
in
saying
thou
lay
thy
to
a
shilling
all
thou
meanest
is
this
that
thou
believest
now
what
thou
believe
that
widow

whence
cried

hast
thou
all
this

of

falling
in

with
a
popish

was
a
beguine
said
my
uncle
toby
doctor
slop
was
too
much
in
wrath
to
listen
to
the
distinction
and
my
father
taking
that
very
crisis
to
fall
in
upon
the
whole
order
of
nuns
and
beguines
a
set
of
silly
fusty
baggages
slop
could
not
stand
it
and
my
uncle
toby
having
some
measures
to
take
about
his
breeches
and
yorick
about
his
fourth
general
division
in
order
for
their
several
attacks
next
day
the
company
broke
up
and
my
father
being
left
alone
and
having
half
an
hour
upon
his
hands
betwixt
that
and
he
called
for
pen
ink
and
paper
and
wrote
my
uncle
toby
the
following
letter
of
instructions
my
dear
brother
toby
what
i
am
going
to
say
to
thee
is
upon
the
nature
of
women
and
of
to
them
and
perhaps
it
is
as
well
for
thee
tho
not
so
well
for
me
that
thou
hast
occasion
for
a
letter
of
instructions
upon
that
head
and
that
i
am
able
to
write
it
to
thee
had
it
been
the
good
pleasure
of
him
who
disposes
of
our
lots
and
thou
no
sufferer
by
the
knowledge
i
had
been
well
content
that
thou
have
dipp
the
pen
this
moment
into
the
ink
instead
of
myself
but
that
not
being
the
case
shandy
being
now
close
beside
me
preparing
for
bed
i
have
thrown
together
without
order
and
just
as
they
have
come
into
my
mind
such
hints
and
documents
as
i
deem
may
be
of
use
to
thee
intending
in
this
to
give
thee
a
token
of
my
love
not
doubting
my
dear
toby
of
the
manner
in
which
it
will
be
accepted
in
the
first
place
with
regard
to
all
which
concerns
religion
in
the
affair
though
i
perceive
from
a
glow
in
my
cheek
that
i
blush
as
i
begin
to
speak
to
thee
upon
the
subject
as
well
knowing
notwithstanding
thy
unaffected
secrecy
how
few
of
its
offices
thou
neglectest
yet
i
would
remind
thee
of
one
during
the
continuance
of
thy
courtship
in
a
particular
manner
which
i
would
not
have
omitted
and
that
is
never
to
go
forth
upon
the
enterprize
whether
it
be
in
the
morning
or
the
afternoon
without
first
recommending
thyself
to
the
protection
of
almighty
god
that
he
may
defend
thee
from
the
evil
one
shave
the
whole
top
of
thy
crown
clean
once
at
least
every
four
or
five
days
but
oftner
if
convenient
lest
in
taking
off
thy
wig
before
her
thro
absence
of
mind
she
should
be
able
to
discover
how
much
has
been
cut
away
by
time
how
much
by
trim
better
to
keep
ideas
of
baldness
out
of
her
fancy
always
carry
it
in
thy
mind
and
act
upon
it
as
a
sure
maxim
toby
women
are
timid
and
is
well
they
are
else
there
would
be
no
dealing
with
them
let
not
thy
breeches
be
too
tight
or
hang
too
loose
about
thy
thighs
like
the
of
our
ancestors
a
just
medium
prevents
all
conclusions
whatever
thou
hast
to
say
be
it
more
or
less
forget
not
to
utter
it
in
a
low
soft
tone
of
voice
silence
and
whatever
approaches
it
weaves
dreams
of
midnight
secrecy
into
the
brain
for
this
cause
if
thou
canst
help
it
never
throw
down
the
tongs
and
poker
avoid
all
kinds
of
pleasantry
and
facetiousness
in
thy
discourse
with
her
and
do
whatever
lies
in
thy
power
at
the
same
time
to
keep
her
from
all
books
and
writings
which
tend
thereto
there
are
some
devotional
tracts
which
if
thou
canst
entice
her
to
read
over
it
will
be
well
but
suffer
her
not
to
look
into
rabelais
or
scarron
or
don
quixote
they
are
all
books
which
excite
laughter
and
thou
knowest
dear
toby
that
there
is
no
passion
so
serious
as
lust
stick
a
pin
in
the
bosom
of
thy
shirt
before
thou
enterest
her
parlour
and
if
thou
art
permitted
to
sit
upon
the
same
sopha
with
her
and
she
gives
thee
occasion
to
lay
thy
hand
upon
hers
beware
of
taking
it
thou
canst
not
lay
thy
hand
on
hers
but
she
will
feel
the
temper
of
thine
leave
that
and
as
many
other
things
as
thou
canst
quite
undetermined
by
so
doing
thou
wilt
have
her
curiosity
on
thy
side
and
if
she
is
not
conquered
by
that
and
thy
asse
continues
still
kicking
which
there
is
great
reason
to
suppose
thou
must
begin
with
first
losing
a
few
ounces
of
blood
below
the
ears
according
to
the
practice
of
the
ancient
scythians
who
cured
the
most
intemperate
fits
of
the
appetite
by
that
means
avicenna
after
this
is
for
having
the
part
anointed
with
the
syrup
of
hellebore
using
proper
evacuations
and
purges
and
i
believe
rightly
but
thou
must
eat
little
or
no
goat
flesh
nor
red
deer
nor
even
foal
flesh
by
any
means
and
carefully
abstain
that
is
as
much
as
thou
canst
from
peacocks
cranes
coots
didappers
and
as
for
thy
drink
i
need
not
tell
thee
it
must
be
the
infusion
of
vervain
and
the
herb
hanea
of
which
aelian
relates
such
effects
but
if
thy
stomach
palls
with
it
discontinue
it
from
time
to
time
taking
cucumbers
melons
purslane
woodbine
and
lettice
in
the
stead
of
them
there
is
nothing
further
for
thee
which
occurs
to
me
at
present
unless
the
breaking
out
of
a
fresh
war
so
wishing
every
thing

for
best

whilst
my
father
was
writing
his
letter
of
instructions
my
uncle
toby
and
the
corporal
were
busy
in
preparing
every
thing
for
the
attack
as
the
turning
of
the
thin
scarlet
breeches
was
laid
aside
at
least
for
the
present
there
was
nothing
which
should
put
it
off
beyond
the
next
morning
so
accordingly
it
was
resolv
upon
for
eleven
come
my
dear
said
my
father
to
my
mother
be
but
like
a
brother
and
sister
if
you
and
i
take
a
walk
down
to
my
brother
toby
to
countenance
him
in
this
attack
of
his
my
uncle
toby
and
the
corporal
had
been
accoutred
both
some
time
when
my
father
and
mother
enter
and
the
clock
striking
eleven
were
that
moment
in
motion
to
sally
forth
but
the
account
of
this
is
worth
more
than
to
be
wove
into
the
fag
end
of
the
eighth
alluding
to
the
first
edition
volume
of
such
a
work
as
my
father
had
no
time
but
to
put
the
letter
of
instructions
into
my
uncle
toby
and
join
with
my
mother
in
wishing
his
attack
prosperous

could
like
said
my
mother
to
look
through
the
out
of
curiosity
call
it
by
its
right

check
us
in

me
witness

i
could
never

fairly
to
my
uncle

amours
till
this
very
moment
that
my

curiosity
as
she
stated
the
affair

take
a
peep
at

but
the
fermentation
of
that
little
subacid
humour
which
i
have
often
spoken
of
in
my
father
habit
could
have
vented
such
an
insinuation
he
was
however
frank
and
generous
in
his
nature
and
at
all
times
open
to
conviction
so
that
he
had
scarce
got
to
the
last
word
of
this
ungracious
retort
when
his
conscience
smote
him
my
mother
was
then
conjugally
swinging
with
her
left
arm
twisted
under
his
right
in
such
wise
that
the
inside
of
her
hand
rested
upon
the
back
of
his

raised
her
fingers
and
let
them
fall
it
could
scarce
be

a
tap
or
if
it
was
a
tap
have
puzzled
a
casuist
to
say
whether
was
a
tap
of
remonstrance
or
a
tap
of
confession
my
father
who
was
all
sensibilities
from
head
to
foot
class
it
right
conscience
redoubled
her
blow
he
turn
his
face
suddenly
the
other
way
and
my
mother
supposing
his
body
was
about
to
turn
with
it
in
order
to
move
homewards
by
a
cross
movement
of
her
right
leg
keeping
her
left
as
its
centre
brought
herself
so
far
in
front
that
as
he
turned
his
head
he
met
her
eye
confusion
again
he
saw
a
thousand
reasons
to
wipe
out
the
reproach
and
as
many
to
reproach
himself
a
thin
blue
chill
pellucid
chrystal
with
all
its
humours
so
at
rest
the
least
mote
or
speck
of
desire
might
have
been
seen
at
the
bottom
of
it
had
it
existed
it
did
not
and
how
i
happen
to
be
so
lewd
myself
particularly
a
little
before
the
vernal
and
autumnal
equinoxes
heaven
above
knows
my
mother
madam
was
so
at
no
time
either
by
nature
by
institution
or
example
a
temperate
current
of
blood
ran
orderly
through
her
veins
in
all
months
of
the
year
and
in
all
critical
moments
both
of
the
day
and
night
alike
nor
did
she
superinduce
the
least
heat
into
her
humours
from
the
manual
effervescencies
of
devotional
tracts
which
having
little
or
no
meaning
in
them
nature
is
obliged
to
find
one
and
as
for
my
father
example
was
so
far
from
being
either
aiding
or
abetting
thereunto
that
was
the
whole
business
of
his
life
to
keep
all
fancies
of
that
kind
out
of
her
head
nature
had
done
her
part
to
have
spared
him
this
trouble
and
what
was
not
a
little
inconsistent
my
father
knew
it
and
here
am
i
sitting
this
day
of
august
in
a
purple
jerkin
and
yellow
pair
of
slippers
without
either
wig
or
cap
on
a
most
tragicomical
completion
of
his
prediction
i
should
neither
think
nor
act
like
any
other
man
child
upon
that
very
account
the
mistake
in
my
father
was
in
attacking
my
mother
motive
instead
of
the
act
itself
for
certainly
were
made
for
other
purposes
and
considering
the
act
as
an
act
which
interfered
with
a
true
proposition
and
denied
a
to
be
what
it
was
it
became
a
violation
of
nature
and
was
so
far
you
see
criminal
it
is
for
this
reason
an
please
your
reverences
that
are
the
occasions
of
more
sin
and
wickedness
than
all
other
holes
in
this
world
put
together
which
leads
me
to
my
uncle
toby
amours
chapter
though
the
corporal
had
been
as
good
as
his
word
in
putting
my
uncle
toby
great
into
pipes
yet
the
time
was
too
short
to
produce
any
great
effects
from
it
it
had
lain
many
years
squeezed
up
in
the
corner
of
his
old
campaign
trunk
and
as
bad
forms
are
not
so
easy
to
be
got
the
better
of
and
the
use
of
not
so
well
understood
it
was
not
so
pliable
a
business
as
one
would
have
wished
the
corporal
with
cheary
eye
and
both
arms
extended
had
fallen
back
perpendicular
from
it
a
score
times
to
inspire
it
if
possible
with
a
better
air
had
spleen
given
a
look
at
it
have
cost
her
ladyship
a
smile
it
curl
every
where
but
where
the
corporal
would
have
it
and
where
a
buckle
or
two
in
his
opinion
would
have
done
it
honour
he
could
as
soon
have
raised
the
dead
such
it
was
or
rather
such
would
it
have
seem
upon
any
other
brow
but
the
sweet
look
of
goodness
which
sat
upon
my
uncle
toby
assimilated
every
thing
around
it
so
sovereignly
to
itself
and
nature
had
moreover
wrote
gentleman
with
so
fair
a
hand
in
every
line
of
his
countenance
that
even
his
tarnish
hat
and
huge
cockade
of
flimsy
taffeta
became
him
and
though
not
worth
a
button
in
themselves
yet
the
moment
my
uncle
toby
put
them
on
they
became
serious
objects
and
altogether
seem
to
have
been
picked
up
by
the
hand
of
science
to
set
him
off
to
advantage
nothing
in
this
world
could
have
more
powerfully
towards
this
than
my
uncle
toby
blue
and
gold
had
not
quantity
in
some
measure
been
necessary
to
grace
in
a
period
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
since
they
had
been
made
by
a
total
inactivity
in
my
uncle
toby
life
for
he
seldom
went
further
than
the
his
blue
and
gold
had
become
so
miserably
too
straight
for
him
that
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
the
corporal
was
able
to
get
him
into
them
the
taking
them
up
at
the
sleeves
was
of
no
they
were
laced
however
down
the
back
and
at
the
seams
of
the
sides
in
the
mode
of
king
william
reign
and
to
shorten
all
description
they
shone
so
bright
against
the
sun
that
morning
and
had
so
metallick
and
doughty
an
air
with
them
that
had
my
uncle
toby
thought
of
attacking
in
armour
nothing
could
have
so
well
imposed
upon
his
imagination
as
for
the
thin
scarlet
breeches
they
had
been
unripp
by
the
taylor
between
the
legs
and
left
at
sixes
and
sevens
yes
madam
but
let
us
govern
our
fancies
it
is
enough
they
were
held
impracticable
the
night
before
and
as
there
was
no
alternative
in
my
uncle
toby
wardrobe
he
sallied
forth
in
the
red
plush
the
corporal
had
array
himself
in
poor
le
fever
regimental
coat
and
with
his
hair
tuck
up
under
his
which
he
had
furbish
up
for
the
occasion
march
three
paces
distant
from
his
master
a
whiff
of
military
pride
had
puff
out
his
shirt
at
the
wrist
and
upon
that
in
a
black
leather
thong
clipp
into
a
tassel
beyond
the
knot
hung
the
corporal
stick
my
uncle
toby
carried
his
cane
like
a
pike
it
looks
well
at
least
quoth
my
father
to
himself
chapter
my
uncle
toby
turn
his
head
more
than
once
behind
him
to
see
how
he
was
supported
by
the
corporal
and
the
corporal
as
oft
as
he
did
it
gave
a
slight
flourish
with
his
stick
but
not
vapouringly
and
with
the
sweetest
accent
of
most
respectful
encouragement
bid
his
honour
fear
now
my
uncle
toby
did
fear
and
grievously
too
he
knew
not
as
my
father
had
reproach
him
so
much
as
the
right
end
of
a
woman
from
the
wrong
and
therefore
was
never
altogether
at
his
ease
near
any
one
of
them
unless
in
sorrow
or
distress
then
infinite
was
his
pity
nor
would
the
most
courteous
knight
of
romance
have
gone
further
at
least
upon
one
leg
to
have
wiped
away
a
tear
from
a
woman
eye
and
yet
excepting
once
that
he
was
beguiled
into
it
by
wadman
he
had
never
looked
stedfastly
into
one
and
would
often
tell
my
father
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
that
it
was
almost
if
not
about
as
bad
as
taking
and
suppose
it
is
my
father
would
say
chapter
she
can
not
quoth
my

within
twenty
paces
of

door

can
not

take
it
she
will
take
it

your
honour
said
the
corporal
just
as
the
jew
widow
at
lisbon
took
it
of
my
brother
and
how
was
that
quoth
my
uncle
toby
facing
quite
about
to
the
corporal
your
honour
replied
the
corporal
knows
of
tom
misfortunes
but
this
affair
has
nothing
to
do
with
them
any
further
than
this
that
if
tom
had
not
married
the
widow
or
had
it
pleased
god
after
their
marriage
that
they
had
but
put
pork
into
their
sausages
the
honest
soul
had
never
been
taken
out
of
his
warm
bed
and
dragg
to
the
inquisition
is
a
cursed
place
added
the
corporal
shaking
his
head
when
once
a
poor
creature
is
in
he
is
in
an
please
your
honour
for
ever
is
very
true
said
my
uncle
toby
looking
gravely
at
house
as
he
spoke
nothing
continued
the
corporal
can
be
so
sad
as
confinement
for
life
or
so
sweet
an
please
your
honour
as
liberty
nothing
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
musing
whilst
a
man
is
free
cried
the
corporal
giving
a
flourish
with
his
stick
thus
squiggly
line
diagonally
across
the
page
a
thousand
of
my
father
most
subtle
syllogisms
could
not
have
said
more
for
celibacy
my
uncle
toby
look
earnestly
towards
his
cottage
and
his
the
corporal
had
unwarily
conjured
up
the
spirit
of
calculation
with
his
wand
and
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
conjure
him
down
again
with
his
story
and
in
this
form
of
exorcism
most
did
the
corporal
do
it
chapter
as
tom
place
an
please
your
honour
was
easy
and
the
weather
warm
it
put
him
upon
thinking
seriously
of
settling
himself
in
the
world
and
as
it
fell
out
about
that
time
that
a
jew
who
kept
a
sausage
shop
in
the
same
street
had
the
ill
luck
to
die
of
a
strangury
and
leave
his
widow
in
possession
of
a
rousing
trade
tom
thought
as
every
body
in
lisbon
was
doing
the
best
he
could
devise
for
himself
there
could
be
no
harm
in
offering
her
his
service
to
carry
it
on
so
without
any
introduction
to
the
widow
except
that
of
buying
a
pound
of
sausages
at
her
shop
tom
set
out
counting
the
matter
thus
within
himself
as
he
walk
along
that
let
the
worst
come
of
it
that
could
he
should
at
least
get
a
pound
of
sausages
for
their
worth
but
if
things
went
well
he
should
be
set
up
inasmuch
as
he
should
get
not
only
a
pound
of
sausages
but
a
wife
and
a
sausage
shop
an
please
your
honour
into
the
bargain
every
servant
in
the
family
from
high
to
low
wish
tom
success
and
i
can
fancy
an
please
your

i
see
him
this
moment
with
his
white
dimity
and
breeches
and
hat
a
little
o
one
side
passing
jollily
along
the
street
swinging
his
stick
with
a
smile
and
a
chearful
word
for
every
body
he
met
but
alas
tom
thou
smilest
no
more
cried
the
corporal
looking
on
one
side
of
him
upon
the
ground
as
if
he
apostrophised
him
in
his
dungeon
poor
fellow
said
my
uncle
toby
feelingly
he
was
an
honest
lad
an
please
your
honour
as
ever
blood
warm
then
he
resembled
thee
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
rapidly
the
corporal
blush
down
to
his
fingers
ends
a
tear
of
sentimental
bashfulness
another
of
gratitude
to
my
uncle
toby
and
a
tear
of
sorrow
for
his
brother
misfortunes
started
into
his
eye
and
ran
sweetly
down
his
cheek
together
my
uncle
toby
kindled
as
one
lamp
does
at
another
and
taking
hold
of
the
breast
of
trim
coat
which
had
been
that
of
le
fever
as
if
to
ease
his
lame
leg
but
in
reality
to
gratify
a
finer
feeling
he
stood
silent
for
a
minute
and
a
half
at
the
end
of
which
he
took
his
hand
away
and
the
corporal
making
a
bow
went
on
with
his
story
of
his
brother
and
the
jew
widow
chapter
when
tom
an
please
your
honour
got
to
the
shop
there
was
nobody
in
it
but
a
poor
negro
girl
with
a
bunch
of
white
feathers
slightly
tied
to
the
end
of
a
long
cane
flapping
away
flies
not
killing
is
a
pretty
picture
said
my
uncle
toby
she
had
suffered
persecution
trim
and
had
learnt
mercy
she
was
good
an
please
your
honour
from
nature
as
well
as
from
hardships
and
there
are
circumstances
in
the
story
of
that
poor
friendless
slut
that
would
melt
a
heart
of
stone
said
trim
and
some
dismal
winter
evening
when
your
honour
is
in
the
humour
they
shall
be
told
you
with
the
rest
of
tom
story
for
it
makes
a
part
of
it
then
do
not
forget
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
a
negro
has
a
soul
an
please
your
honour
said
the
corporal
doubtingly
i
am
not
much
versed
corporal
quoth
my
uncle
toby
in
things
of
that
kind
but
i
suppose
god
would
not
leave
him
without
one
any
more
than
thee
or
me
it
would
be
putting
one
sadly
over
the
head
of
another
quoth
the
corporal
it
would
so
said
my
uncle
toby
why
then
an
please
your
honour
is
a
black
wench
to
be
used
worse
than
a
white
one
i
can
give
no
reason
said
my
uncle
toby
only
cried
the
corporal
shaking
his
head
because
she
has
no
one
to
stand
up
for
her
is
that
very
thing
trim
quoth
my
uncle
toby
which
recommends
her
to
protection
and
her
brethren
with
her
is
the
fortune
of
war
which
has
put
the
whip
into
our
hands
now
where
it
may
be
hereafter
heaven
knows
but
be
it
where
it
will
the
brave
trim
will
not
use
it
unkindly
god
forbid
said
the
corporal
amen
responded
my
uncle
toby
laying
his
hand
upon
his
heart
the
corporal
returned
to
his
story
and
went
on
but
with
an
embarrassment
in
doing
it
which
here
and
there
a
reader
in
this
world
will
not
be
able
to
comprehend
for
by
the
many
sudden
transitions
all
along
from
one
kind
and
cordial
passion
to
another
in
getting
thus
far
on
his
way
he
had
lost
the
sportable
key
of
his
voice
which
gave
sense
and
spirit
to
his
tale
he
attempted
twice
to
resume
it
but
could
not
please
himself
so
giving
a
stout
hem
to
rally
back
the
retreating
spirits
and
aiding
nature
at
the
same
time
with
his
left
arm
a
kimbo
on
one
side
and
with
his
right
a
little
extended
supporting
her
on
the
other
the
corporal
got
as
near
the
note
as
he
could
and
in
that
attitude
continued
his
story
chapter
as
tom
an
please
your
honour
had
no
business
at
that
time
with
the
moorish
girl
he
passed
on
into
the
room
beyond
to
talk
to
the
widow
about
love
and
this
pound
of
sausages
and
being
as
i
have
told
your
honour
an
open
lad
with
his
character
wrote
in
his
looks
and
carriage
he
took
a
chair
and
without
much
apology
but
with
great
civility
at
the
same
time
placed
it
close
to
her
at
the
table
and
sat
down
there
is
nothing
so
awkward
as
courting
a
woman
an
please
your
honour
whilst
she
is
making
sausages
so
tom
began
a
discourse
upon
them
first
gravely
how
they
were
made
with
what
meats
herbs
and
spices
then
a
little
gayly
as
what
skins
and
if
they
never
burst
whether
the
largest
were
not
the
best
and
so
on
taking
care
only
as
he
went
along
to
season
what
he
had
to
say
upon
sausages
rather
under
than
over
that
he
might
have
room
to
act
in
it
was
owing
to
the
neglect
of
that
very
precaution
said
my
uncle
toby
laying
his
hand
upon
trim
shoulder
that
count
de
la
motte
lost
the
battle
of
wynendale
he
pressed
too
speedily
into
the
wood
which
if
he
had
not
done
lisle
had
not
fallen
into
our
hands
nor
ghent
and
bruges
which
both
followed
her
example
it
was
so
late
in
the
year
continued
my
uncle
toby
and
so
terrible
a
season
came
on
that
if
things
had
not
fallen
out
as
they
did
our
troops
must
have
perish
in
the
open
why
therefore
may
not
battles
an
please
your
honour
as
well
as
marriages
be
made
in
heaven
my
uncle
toby
mused
religion
inclined
him
to
say
one
thing
and
his
high
idea
of
military
skill
tempted
him
to
say
another
so
not
being
able
to
frame
a
reply
exactly
to
his
mind
my
uncle
toby
said
nothing
at
all
and
the
corporal
finished
his
story
as
tom
perceived
an
please
your
honour
that
he
gained
ground
and
that
all
he
had
said
upon
the
subject
of
sausages
was
kindly
taken
he
went
on
to
help
her
a
little
in
making
first
by
taking
hold
of
the
ring
of
the
sausage
whilst
she
stroked
the
forced
meat
down
with
her
hand
then
by
cutting
the
strings
into
proper
lengths
and
holding
them
in
his
hand
whilst
she
took
them
out
one
by
one
then
by
putting
them
across
her
mouth
that
she
might
take
them
out
as
she
wanted
them
and
so
on
from
little
to
more
till
at
last
he
adventured
to
tie
the
sausage
himself
whilst
she
held
the
now
a
widow
an
please
your
honour
always
chuses
a
second
husband
as
unlike
the
first
as
she
can
so
the
affair
was
more
than
half
settled
in
her
mind
before
tom
mentioned
it
she
made
a
feint
however
of
defending
herself
by
snatching
up
a
sausage
tom
instantly
laid
hold
of
another
but
seeing
tom
had
more
gristle
in
it
she
signed
the
capitulation
and
tom
sealed
it
and
there
was
an
end
of
the
matter
chapter
all
womankind
continued
trim
commenting
upon
his
story
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
an
please
your
honour
love
jokes
the
difficulty
is
to
know
how
they
chuse
to
have
them
cut
and
there
is
no
knowing
that
but
by
trying
as
we
do
with
our
artillery
in
the
field
by
raising
or
letting
down
their
breeches
till
we
hit
the
i
like
the
comparison
said
my
uncle
toby
better
than
the
thing
itself
because
your
honour
quoth
the
corporal
loves
glory
more
than
pleasure
i
hope
trim
answered
my
uncle
toby
i
love
mankind
more
than
either
and
as
the
knowledge
of
arms
tends
so
apparently
to
the
good
and
quiet
of
the
world
and
particularly
that
branch
of
it
which
we
have
practised
together
in
our

no
object
but
to
shorten
the
strides
of
ambition
and
intrench
the
lives
and
fortunes
of
the

from
the
plunderings
of
the
many
whenever
that
drum
beats
in
our
ears
i
trust
corporal
we
shall
neither
of
us
want
so
much
humanity
and
as
to
face
about
and
march
in
pronouncing
this
my
uncle
toby
faced
about
and
march
firmly
as
at
the
head
of
his
company
and
the
faithful
corporal
shouldering
his
stick
and
striking
his
hand
upon
his
as
he
took
his
first
step
march
close
behind
him
down
the
avenue
now
what
can
their
two
noddles
be
about
cried
my
father
to
my

by
all
that
strange
they
are
besieging
wadman
in
form
and
are
marching
round
her
house
to
mark
out
the
lines
of
circumvallation
i
dare
say
quoth
my
mother
but
stop
dear
sir
for
what
my
mother
dared
to
say
upon
the
occasion
and
what
my
father
did
say
upon
it
with
her
replies
and
his
rejoinders
shall
be
read
perused
paraphrased
commented
and
descanted
upon
or
to
say
it
all
in
a
word
shall
be
thumb
over
by
posterity
in
a
chapter
apart
i
say
by
posterity
and
care
not
if
i
repeat
the
word
again
for
what
has
this
book
done
more
than
the
legation
of
moses
or
the
tale
of
a
tub
that
it
may
not
swim
down
the
gutter
of
time
along
with
them
i
will
not
argue
the
matter
time
wastes
too
fast
every
letter
i
trace
tells
me
with
what
rapidity
life
follows
my
pen
the
days
and
hours
of
it
more
precious
my
dear
jenny
than
the
rubies
about
thy
neck
are
flying
over
our
heads
like
light
clouds
of
a
windy
day
never
to
return
more
every
thing
presses
on
whilst
thou
art
twisting
that
lock
see
it
grows
grey
and
every
time
i
kiss
thy
hand
to
bid
adieu
and
every
absence
which
follows
it
are
preludes
to
that
eternal
separation
which
we
are
shortly
to
heaven
have
mercy
upon
us
both
chapter
now
for
what
the
world
thinks
of
that
ejaculation
i
would
not
give
a
groat
chapter
my
mother
had
gone
with
her
left
arm
twisted
in
my
father
right
till
they
had
got
to
the
fatal
angle
of
the
old
garden
wall
where
doctor
slop
was
overthrown
by
obadiah
on
the
as
this
was
directly
opposite
to
the
front
of
wadman
house
when
my
father
came
to
it
he
gave
a
look
across
and
seeing
my
uncle
toby
and
the
corporal
within
ten
paces
of
the
door
he
turn
about
us
just
stop
a
moment
quoth
my
father
and
see
with
what
ceremonies
my
brother
toby
and
his
man
trim
make
their
first
entry
it
will
not
detain
us
added
my
father
a
single
minute
no
matter
if
it
be
ten
minutes
quoth
my
mother
it
will
not
detain
us
half
one
said
my
father
the
corporal
was
just
then
setting
in
with
the
story
of
his
brother
tom
and
the
jew
widow
the
story
went
on
and
on
it
had
episodes
in
it
it
came
back
and
went
on
and
on
again
there
was
no
end
of
it
the
reader
found
it
very
long
help
my
father
he
pish
fifty
times
at
every
new
attitude
and
gave
the
corporal
stick
with
all
its
flourishings
and
danglings
to
as
many
devils
as
chose
to
accept
of
them
when
issues
of
events
like
these
my
father
is
waiting
for
are
hanging
in
the
scales
of
fate
the
mind
has
the
advantage
of
changing
the
principle
of
expectation
three
times
without
which
it
would
not
have
power
to
see
it
out
curiosity
governs
the
first
moment
and
the
second
moment
is
all
oeconomy
to
justify
the
expence
of
the
first
and
for
the
third
fourth
fifth
and
sixth
moments
and
so
on
to
the
day
of
judgment
is
a
point
of
honour
i
need
not
be
told
that
the
ethic
writers
have
assigned
this
all
to
patience
but
that
virtue
methinks
has
extent
of
dominion
sufficient
of
her
own
and
enough
to
do
in
it
without
invading
the
few
dismantled
castles
which
honour
has
left
him
upon
the
earth
my
father
stood
it
out
as
well
as
he
could
with
these
three
auxiliaries
to
the
end
of
trim
story
and
from
thence
to
the
end
of
my
uncle
toby
panegyrick
upon
arms
in
the
chapter
following
it
when
seeing
that
instead
of
marching
up
to
wadman
door
they
both
faced
about
and
march
down
the
avenue
diametrically
opposite
to
his
expectation
he
broke
out
at
once
with
that
little
subacid
soreness
of
humour
which
in
certain
situations
distinguished
his
character
from
that
of
all
other
men
chapter
what
can
their
two
noddles
be
about
cried
my
father
c
i
dare
say
said
my
mother
they
are
making
fortifications
not
on
wadman
premises
cried
my
father
stepping
back
i
suppose
not
quoth
my
mother
i
wish
said
my
father
raising
his
voice
the
whole
science
of
fortification
at
the
devil
with
all
its
trumpery
of
saps
mines
blinds
gabions
and
cuvetts
they
are
foolish
things
said
my
mother
now
she
had
a
way
which
by
the
bye
i
would
this
moment
give
away
my
purple
jerkin
and
my
yellow
slippers
into
the
bargain
if
some
of
your
reverences
would
imitate
and
that
was
never
to
refuse
her
assent
and
consent
to
any
proposition
my
father
laid
before
her
merely
because
she
did
not
understand
it
or
had
no
ideas
of
the
principal
word
or
term
of
art
upon
which
the
tenet
or
proposition
rolled
she
contented
herself
with
doing
all
that
her
godfathers
and
godmothers
promised
for
her
but
no
more
and
so
would
go
on
using
a
hard
word
twenty
years
together
and
replying
to
it
too
if
it
was
a
verb
in
all
its
moods
and
tenses
without
giving
herself
any
trouble
to
enquire
about
it
this
was
an
eternal
source
of
misery
to
my
father
and
broke
the
neck
at
the
first
setting
out
of
more
good
dialogues
between
them
than
could
have
done
the
most
petulant
contradiction
the
few
which
survived
were
the
better
for
the
cuvetts
are
foolish
things
said
my
mother
particularly
the
cuvetts
replied
my
father
is
enough
he
tasted
the
sweet
of
triumph
and
went
on
not
that
they
are
properly
speaking
wadman
premises
said
my
father
partly
correcting
himself
because
she
is
but
tenant
for
life
that
makes
a
great
difference
said
my
mother
in
a
fool
head
replied
my
father
unless
she
should
happen
to
have
a
child
said
my
mother
but
she
must
persuade
my
brother
toby
first
to
get
her
one
to
be
sure
shandy
quoth
my
mother
though
if
it
comes
to
persuasion
said
my
father
lord
have
mercy
upon
them
amen
said
my
mother
piano
amen
cried
my
father
fortissime
amen
said
my
mother
again
but
with
such
a
sighing
cadence
of
personal
pity
at
the
end
of
it
as
discomfited
every
fibre
about
my
father
he
instantly
took
out
his
almanack
but
before
he
could
untie
it
congregation
coming
out
of
church
became
a
full
answer
to
one
half
of
his
business
with
it
and
my
mother
telling
him
it
was
a
sacrament
day
left
him
as
little
in
doubt
as
to
the
other
part
he
put
his
almanack
into
his
pocket
the
first
lord
of
the
treasury
thinking
of
ways
and
means
could
not
have
returned
home
with
a
more
embarrassed
look
chapter
upon
looking
back
from
the
end
of
the
last
chapter
and
surveying
the
texture
of
what
has
been
wrote
it
is
necessary
that
upon
this
page
and
the
three
following
a
good
quantity
of
heterogeneous
matter
be
inserted
to
keep
up
that
just
balance
betwixt
wisdom
and
folly
without
which
a
book
would
not
hold
together
a
single
year
nor
is
it
a
poor
creeping
digression
which
but
for
the
name
of
a
man
might
continue
as
well
going
on
in
the
king
highway
which
will
do
the
business
no
if
it
is
to
be
a
digression
it
must
be
a
good
frisky
one
and
upon
a
frisky
subject
too
where
neither
the
horse
or
his
rider
are
to
be
caught
but
by
rebound
the
only
difficulty
is
raising
powers
suitable
to
the
nature
of
the
service
fancy
is
capricious
wit
must
not
be
searched
for
and
pleasantry
slut
as
she
is
will
not
come
in
at
a
call
was
an
empire
to
be
laid
at
her
feet
the
best
way
for
a
man
is
to
say
his
prayers
only
if
it
puts
him
in
mind
of
his
infirmities
and
defects
as
well
ghostly
as
bodily
for
that
purpose
he
will
find
himself
rather
worse
after
he
has
said
them
than
before
for
other
purposes
better
for
my
own
part
there
is
not
a
way
either
moral
or
mechanical
under
heaven
that
i
could
think
of
which
i
have
not
taken
with
myself
in
this
case
sometimes
by
addressing
myself
directly
to
the
soul
herself
and
arguing
the
point
over
and
over
again
with
her
upon
the
extent
of
her
own
faculties
i
never
could
make
them
an
inch
the
wider
then
by
changing
my
system
and
trying
what
could
be
made
of
it
upon
the
body
by
temperance
soberness
and
chastity
these
are
good
quoth
i
in
themselves
they
are
good
absolutely
they
are
good
relatively
they
are
good
for
health
they
are
good
for
happiness
in
this
world
they
are
good
for
happiness
in
the
next
in
short
they
were
good
for
every
thing
but
the
thing
wanted
and
there
they
were
good
for
nothing
but
to
leave
the
soul
just
as
heaven
made
it
as
for
the
theological
virtues
of
faith
and
hope
they
give
it
courage
but
then
that
snivelling
virtue
of
meekness
as
my
father
would
always
call
it
takes
it
quite
away
again
so
you
are
exactly
where
you
started
now
in
all
common
and
ordinary
cases
there
is
nothing
which
i
have
found
to
answer
so
well
as
this
certainly
if
there
is
any
dependence
upon
logic
and
that
i
am
not
blinded
by
there
must
be
something
of
true
genius
about
me
merely
upon
this
symptom
of
it
that
i
do
not
know
what
envy
is
for
never
do
i
hit
upon
any
invention
or
device
which
tendeth
to
the
furtherance
of
good
writing
but
i
instantly
make
it
public
willing
that
all
mankind
should
write
as
well
as
myself
which
they
certainly
will
when
they
think
as
little
chapter
now
in
ordinary
cases
that
is
when
i
am
only
stupid
and
the
thoughts
rise
heavily
and
pass
gummous
through
my
pen
or
that
i
am
got
i
know
not
how
into
a
cold
unmetaphorical
vein
of
infamous
writing
and
can
not
take
a
out
of
it
for
my
soul
so
must
be
obliged
to
go
on
writing
like
a
dutch
commentator
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
unless
something
be
done
i
never
stand
conferring
with
pen
and
ink
one
moment
for
if
a
pinch
of
snuff
or
a
stride
or
two
across
the
room
will
not
do
the
business
for
me
i
take
a
razor
at
once
and
having
tried
the
edge
of
it
upon
the
palm
of
my
hand
without
further
ceremony
except
that
of
first
lathering
my
beard
i
shave
it
off
taking
care
only
if
i
do
leave
a
hair
that
it
be
not
a
grey
one
this
done
i
change
my
shirt
put
on
a
better
coat
send
for
my
last
wig
put
my
topaz
ring
upon
my
finger
and
in
a
word
dress
myself
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
me
after
my
best
fashion
now
the
devil
in
hell
must
be
in
it
if
this
does
not
do
for
consider
sir
as
every
man
chuses
to
be
present
at
the
shaving
of
his
own
beard
though
there
is
no
rule
without
an
exception
and
unavoidably
sits
himself
the
whole
time
it
is
doing
in
case
he
has
a
hand
in
it
the
situation
like
all
others
has
notions
of
her
own
to
put
into
the
i
maintain
it
the
conceits
of
a
man
are
seven
years
more
terse
and
juvenile
for
one
single
operation
and
if
they
did
not
run
a
risk
of
being
quite
shaved
away
might
be
carried
up
by
continual
shavings
to
the
highest
pitch
of
sublimity
how
homer
could
write
with
so
long
a
beard
i
do
know
and
as
it
makes
against
my
hypothesis
i
as
little
care
but
let
us
return
to
the
toilet
ludovicus
sorbonensis
makes
this
entirely
an
affair
of
the
body
greek
as
he
calls
it
but
he
is
deceived
the
soul
and
body
are
in
every
thing
they
get
a
man
can
not
dress
but
his
ideas
get
at
the
same
time
and
if
he
dresses
like
a
gentleman
every
one
of
them
stands
presented
to
his
imagination
genteelized
along
with
him
so
that
he
has
nothing
to
do
but
take
his
pen
and
write
like
himself
for
this
cause
when
your
honours
and
reverences
would
know
whether
i
writ
clean
and
fit
to
be
read
you
will
be
able
to
judge
full
as
well
by
looking
into
my
laundress
bill
as
my
book
there
is
one
single
month
in
which
i
can
make
it
appear
that
i
dirtied
one
and
thirty
shirts
with
clean
writing
and
after
all
was
more
abus
cursed
criticis
and
confounded
and
had
more
mystic
heads
shaken
at
me
for
what
i
had
wrote
in
that
one
month
than
in
all
the
other
months
of
that
year
put
together
but
their
honours
and
reverences
had
not
seen
my
bills
chapter
as
i
never
had
any
intention
of
beginning
the
digression
i
am
making
all
this
preparation
for
till
i
come
to
the
chapter
i
have
this
chapter
to
put
to
whatever
use
i
think
proper
i
have
twenty
this
moment
ready
for
it
i
could
write
my
chapter
of
in
it
or
my
chapter
of
pishes
which
should
follow
them
or
my
chapter
of
knots
in
case
their
reverences
have
done
with
them
they
might
lead
me
into
mischief
the
safest
way
is
to
follow
the
track
of
the
learned
and
raise
objections
against
what
i
have
been
writing
tho
i
declare
i
know
no
more
than
my
heels
how
to
answer
them
and
first
it
may
be
said
there
is
a
pelting
kind
of
thersitical
satire
as
black
as
the
very
ink
is
wrote
with
and
by
the
bye
whoever
says
so
is
indebted
to
the
general
of
the
grecian
army
for
suffering
the
name
of
so
ugly
and
a
man
as
thersites
to
continue
upon
his
roll
for
it
has
furnish
him
with
an
epithet
in
these
productions
he
will
urge
all
the
personal
washings
and
scrubbings
upon
earth
do
a
sinking
genius
no
sort
of
good
but
just
the
contrary
inasmuch
as
the
dirtier
the
fellow
is
the
better
generally
he
succeeds
in
it
to
this
i
have
no
other
answer
at
least
ready
but
that
the
archbishop
of
benevento
wrote
his
nasty
romance
of
the
galatea
as
all
the
world
knows
in
a
purple
coat
waistcoat
and
purple
pair
of
breeches
and
that
the
penance
set
him
of
writing
a
commentary
upon
the
book
of
the
revelations
as
severe
as
it
was
look
upon
by
one
part
of
the
world
was
far
from
being
deem
so
by
the
other
upon
the
single
account
of
that
investment
another
objection
to
all
this
remedy
is
its
want
of
universality
forasmuch
as
the
shaving
part
of
it
upon
which
so
much
stress
is
laid
by
an
unalterable
law
of
nature
excludes
one
half
of
the
species
entirely
from
its
use
all
i
can
say
is
that
female
writers
whether
of
england
or
of
france
must
go
without
it
as
for
the
spanish
ladies
i
am
in
no
sort
of
distress
chapter
the
chapter
is
come
at
last
and
brings
nothing
with
it
but
a
sad
signature
of
our
pleasures
slip
from
under
us
in
this
world
for
in
talking
of
my
digression
i
declare
before
heaven
i
have
made
it
what
a
strange
creature
is
mortal
man
said
she
is
very
true
said
i
but
better
to
get
all
these
things
out
of
our
heads
and
return
to
my
uncle
toby
chapter
when
my
uncle
toby
and
the
corporal
had
marched
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
avenue
they
recollected
their
business
lay
the
other
way
so
they
faced
about
and
marched
up
straight
to
wadman
door
i
warrant
your
honour
said
the
corporal
touching
his
with
his
hand
as
he
passed
him
in
order
to
give
a
knock
at
the
door
my
uncle
toby
contrary
to
his
invariable
way
of
treating
his
faithful
servant
said
nothing
good
or
bad
the
truth
was
he
had
not
altogether
marshal
his
ideas
he
wish
for
another
conference
and
as
the
corporal
was
mounting
up
the
three
steps
before
the
door
he
twice
a
portion
of
my
uncle
toby
most
modest
spirits
fled
at
each
expulsion
towards
the
corporal
he
stood
with
the
rapper
of
the
door
suspended
for
a
full
minute
in
his
hand
he
scarce
knew
why
bridget
stood
perdue
within
with
her
finger
and
her
thumb
upon
the
latch
benumb
with
expectation
and
wadman
with
an
eye
ready
to
be
deflowered
again
sat
breathless
behind
the
of
her
watching
their
approach
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
but
as
he
articulated
the
word
the
minute
expired
and
trim
let
fall
the
rapper
my
uncle
toby
perceiving
that
all
hopes
of
a
conference
were
knock
on
the
head
by
it
whistled
lillabullero
chapter
as
bridget
finger
and
thumb
were
upon
the
latch
the
corporal
did
not
knock
as
often
as
perchance
your
honour
taylor
i
might
have
taken
my
example
something
nearer
home
for
i
owe
mine
some
five
and
twenty
pounds
at
least
and
wonder
at
the
man
patience
but
this
is
nothing
at
all
to
the
world
only
is
a
cursed
thing
to
be
in
debt
and
there
seems
to
be
a
fatality
in
the
exchequers
of
some
poor
princes
particularly
those
of
our
house
which
no
economy
can
bind
down
in
irons
for
my
own
part
i
persuaded
there
is
not
any
one
prince
prelate
pope
or
potentate
great
or
small
upon
earth
more
desirous
in
his
heart
of
keeping
straight
with
the
world
than
i
am
or
who
takes
more
likely
means
for
it
i
never
give
above
half
a
guinea
or
walk
with
boots
or
cheapen
or
lay
out
a
shilling
upon
a
the
year
round
and
for
the
six
months
i
in
the
country
upon
so
small
a
scale
that
with
all
the
good
temper
in
the
world
i
outdo
rousseau
a
bar
length
for
i
keep
neither
man
or
boy
or
horse
or
cow
or
dog
or
cat
or
any
thing
that
can
eat
or
drink
except
a
thin
poor
piece
of
a
vestal
to
keep
my
fire
in
and
who
has
generally
as
bad
an
appetite
as
myself
but
if
you
think
this
makes
a
philosopher
of
me
i
would
not
my
good
people
give
a
rush
for
your
judgments
true
philosophy
but
there
is
no
treating
the
subject
whilst
my
uncle
is
whistling

us
go
into
the

you
shall
see
the
very

my
uncle
toby
wadman
blush
look
towards
the
door
turn
pale
slightly
again
recover
her
natural
colour
blush
worse
than
ever
which
for
the
sake
of
the
unlearned
reader
i
translate
thus
i
can
not
look
at
it
would
the
world
say
if
i
look
at
it
should
drop
down
if
i
look
at
it
wish
i
could
look
at
it
can
be
no
sin
in
looking
at
it
will
look
at
it
whilst
all
this
was
running
through
wadman
imagination
my
uncle
toby
had
risen
from
the
sopha
and
got
to
the
other
side
of
the
parlour
door
to
give
trim
an
order
about
it
in
the
passage
i
believe
it
is
in
the
garret
said
my
uncle
toby
i
saw
it
there
an
please
your
honour
this
morning
answered
trim
then
prithee
step
directly
for
it
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
and
bring
it
into
the
parlour
the
corporal
did
not
approve
of
the
orders
but
most
cheerfully
obeyed
them
the
first
was
not
an
act
of
his
will
the
second
was
so
he
put
on
his
and
went
as
fast
as
his
lame
knee
would
let
him
my
uncle
toby
returned
into
the
parlour
and
sat
himself
down
again
upon
the
sopha
you
shall
lay
your
finger
upon
the
place
said
my
uncle
i
will
not
touch
it
however
quoth
wadman
to
herself
this
requires
a
second
translation
it
shews
what
little
knowledge
is
got
by
mere
words
we
must
go
up
to
the
first
springs
now
in
order
to
clear
up
the
mist
which
hangs
upon
these
three
pages
i
must
endeavour
to
be
as
clear
as
possible

rub
your

thrice
across

there
are
fifty

discourse
enquiry
argumentation
and
inference
she
investigates
and
finds
out
whether
she
has
got
hold
of
the
right
one
and
if
she
has
then
by
pulling
it
gently
this
way
and
that
way
she
further
forms
a
judgment
whether
it
will
not
break
in
the
drawing
the
imagery
under
which
slawkenbergius
impresses
this
upon
the
fancy
in
the
beginning
of
his
third
decad
is
so
ludicrous
that
the
honour
i
bear
the
sex
will
not
suffer
me
to
quote
it
otherwise
it
is
not
destitute
of
humour
first
saith
slawkenbergius
stops
the
asse
and
holding
his
halter
in
her
left
hand
lest
he
should
get
away
she
thrusts
her
right
hand
into
the
very
bottom
of
his
pannier
to
search
for
it
for
what
not
know
the
sooner
quoth
slawkenbergius
for
interrupting
me
have
nothing
good
lady
but
empty
bottles
says
the
asse
loaded
with
tripes
says
the
second
and
thou
art
little
better
quoth
she
to
the
third
for
nothing
is
there
in
thy
panniers
but
and
pantofles
and
so
to
the
fourth
and
fifth
going
on
one
by
one
through
the
whole
string
till
coming
to
the
asse
which
carries
it
she
turns
the
pannier
upside
down
looks
at
it
considers
it
samples
it
measures
it
stretches
it
wets
it
dries
it
then
takes
her
teeth
both
to
the
warp
and
weft
of
it
of
what
for
the
love
of
christ
i
am
determined
answered
slawkenbergius
that
all
the
powers
upon
earth
shall
never
wring
that
secret
from
my
breast
chapter
we
live
in
a
world
beset
on
all
sides
with
mysteries
and
riddles
and
so
is
no
matter
else
it
seems
strange
that
nature
who
makes
every
thing
so
well
to
answer
its
destination
and
seldom
or
never
errs
unless
for
pastime
in
giving
such
forms
and
aptitudes
to
whatever
passes
through
her
hands
that
whether
she
designs
for
the
plough
the
caravan
the
cart
or
whatever
other
creature
she
models
be
it
but
an
asse
foal
you
are
sure
to
have
the
thing
you
wanted
and
yet
at
the
same
time
should
so
eternally
bungle
it
as
she
does
in
making
so
simple
a
thing
as
a
married
man
whether
it
is
in
the
choice
of
the
clay
or
that
it
is
frequently
spoiled
in
the
baking
by
an
excess
of
which
a
husband
may
turn
out
too
crusty
you
know
on
one
hand
or
not
enough
so
through
defect
of
heat
on
the
other
or
whether
this
great
artificer
is
not
so
attentive
to
the
little
platonic
exigences
of
that
part
of
the
species
for
whose
use
she
is
fabricating
this
or
that
her
ladyship
sometimes
scarce
knows
what
sort
of
a
husband
will
do
i
know
not
we
will
discourse
about
it
after
supper
it
is
enough
that
neither
the
observation
itself
or
the
reasoning
upon
it
are
at
all
to
the
purpose
but
rather
against
it
since
with
regard
to
my
uncle
toby
fitness
for
the
marriage
state
nothing
was
ever
better
she
had
formed
him
of
the
best
and
kindliest
clay
had
it
with
her
own
milk
and
breathed
into
it
the
sweetest
spirit
she
had
made
him
all
gentle
generous
and
humane
she
had
filled
his
heart
with
trust
and
confidence
and
disposed
every
passage
which
led
to
it
for
the
communication
of
the
tenderest
offices
she
had
moreover
considered
the
other
causes
for
which
matrimony
was
ordained
and
accordingly
the
donation
was
not
defeated
by
my
uncle
toby
wound
now
this
last
article
was
somewhat
apocryphal
and
the
devil
who
is
the
great
disturber
of
our
faiths
in
this
world
had
raised
scruples
in
wadman
brain
about
it
and
like
a
true
devil
as
he
was
had
done
his
own
work
at
the
same
time
by
turning
my
uncle
toby
virtue
thereupon
into
nothing
but
empty
bottles
tripes
and
pantofles
chapter
bridget
had
pawn
all
the
little
stock
of
honour
a
poor
was
worth
in
the
world
that
she
would
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
affair
in
ten
days
and
it
was
built
upon
one
of
the
most
concessible
postulata
in
nature
namely
that
whilst
my
uncle
toby
was
making
love
to
her
mistress
the
corporal
could
find
nothing
better
to
do
than
make
love
to
her
i
let
him
as
much
as
he
will
said
bridget
to
get
it
out
of
him
friendship
has
two
garments
an
outer
and
an
under
one
bridget
was
serving
her
mistress
interests
in
the
one
and
doing
the
thing
which
most
pleased
herself
in
the
other
so
had
as
many
stakes
depending
upon
my
uncle
toby
wound
as
the
devil
himself
wadman
had
but
one
and
as
it
possibly
might
be
her
last
without
discouraging
bridget
or
discrediting
her
talents
was
determined
to
play
her
cards
herself
she
wanted
not
encouragement
a
child
might
have
look
into
his
hand
there
was
such
a
plainness
and
simplicity
in
his
playing
out
what
trumps
he
had
with
such
an
unmistrusting
ignorance
of
the
and
so
naked
and
defenceless
did
he
sit
upon
the
same
sopha
with
widow
wadman
that
a
generous
heart
would
have
wept
to
have
won
the
game
of
him
let
us
drop
the
metaphor
chapter
and
the
story
too
if
you
please
for
though
i
have
all
along
been
hastening
towards
this
part
of
it
with
so
much
earnest
desire
as
well
knowing
it
to
be
the
choicest
morsel
of
what
i
had
to
offer
to
the
world
yet
now
that
i
am
got
to
it
any
one
is
welcome
to
take
my
pen
and
go
on
with
the
story
for
me
that
will
i
see
the
difficulties
of
the
descriptions
i
going
to
give
and
feel
my
want
of
powers
it
is
one
comfort
at
least
to
me
that
i
lost
some
fourscore
ounces
of
blood
this
week
in
a
most
uncritical
fever
which
attacked
me
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
so
that
i
have
still
some
hopes
remaining
it
may
be
more
in
the
serous
or
globular
parts
of
the
blood
than
in
the
subtile
aura
of
the
brain
be
it
which
it
will
an
invocation
can
do
no
hurt
and
i
leave
the
affair
entirely
to
the
invoked
to
inspire
or
to
inject
me
according
as
he
sees
good
the
invocation
gentle
spirit
of
sweetest
humour
who
erst
did
sit
upon
the
easy
pen
of
my
beloved
cervantes
thou
who
glidedst
daily
through
his
lattice
and
the
twilight
of
his
prison
into
brightness
by
thy
presence
his
little
urn
of
water
with
nectar
and
all
the
time
he
wrote
of
sancho
and
his
master
didst
cast
thy
mystic
mantle
his
wither
stump
he
lost
his
hand
at
the
battle
of
lepanto
and
wide
extended
it
to
all
the
evils
of
his
life
turn
in
hither
i
beseech
thee
behold
these
breeches
they
are
all
i
have
in
world
that
piteous
rent
was
given
them
at
lyons
my
shirts
see
what
a
deadly
schism
has
happen
amongst
for
the
laps
are
in
lombardy
and
the
rest
of
here
i
never
had
but
six
and
a
cunning
gypsey
of
a
laundress
at
milan
cut
me
off
the
of
five
to
do
her
justice
she
did
it
with
some
consideration
for
i
was
returning
out
of
italy
and
yet
notwithstanding
all
this
and
a
pistol
which
was
moreover
filch
from
me
at
sienna
and
twice
that
i
pay
five
pauls
for
two
hard
eggs
once
at
raddicoffini
and
a
second
time
at
capua
i
do
not
think
a
journey
through
france
and
italy
provided
a
man
keeps
his
temper
all
the
way
so
bad
a
thing
as
some
people
would
make
you
believe
there
must
be
ups
and
downs
or
how
the
duce
should
we
get
into
vallies
where
nature
spreads
so
many
tables
of
is
nonsense
to
imagine
they
will
lend
you
their
voitures
to
be
shaken
to
pieces
for
nothing
and
unless
you
pay
twelve
sous
for
greasing
your
wheels
how
should
the
poor
peasant
get
butter
to
his
bread
we
really
expect
too
much
and
for
the
livre
or
two
above
par
for
your
suppers
and
bed
at
the
most
they
are
but
one
shilling
and
ninepence
halfpenny
who
would
embroil
their
philosophy
for
it
for
heaven
and
for
your
own
sake
pay
it
pay
it
with
both
hands
open
rather
than
leave
disappointment
sitting
drooping
upon
the
eye
of
your
fair
hostess
and
her
damsels
in
the
at
your
departure
and
besides
my
dear
sir
you
get
a
sisterly
kiss
of
each
of
worth
a
pound
at
least
i
did
for
my
uncle
toby
amours
running
all
the
way
in
my
head
they
had
the
same
effect
upon
me
as
if
they
had
been
my
own
i
was
in
the
most
perfect
state
of
bounty
and
and
felt
the
kindliest
harmony
vibrating
within
me
with
every
oscillation
of
the
chaise
alike
so
that
whether
the
roads
were
rough
or
smooth
it
made
no
difference
every
thing
i
saw
or
had
to
do
with
touch
upon
some
secret
spring
either
of
sentiment
or
rapture
they
were
the
sweetest
notes
i
ever
heard
and
i
instantly
let
down
the
to
hear
them
more
distinctly
is
maria
said
the
postillion
observing
i
was
listening
poor
maria
continued
he
leaning
his
body
on
one
side
to
let
me
see
her
for
he
was
in
a
line
betwixt
us
is
sitting
upon
a
bank
playing
her
vespers
upon
her
pipe
with
her
little
goat
beside
her
the
young
fellow
utter
this
with
an
accent
and
a
look
so
perfectly
in
tune
to
a
feeling
heart
that
i
instantly
made
a
vow
i
would
give
him
a
sous
piece
when
i
got
to
moulins
and
who
is
poor
maria
said
i
the
love
and
piety
of
all
the
villages
around
us
said
the
postillion
it
is
but
three
years
ago
that
the
sun
did
not
shine
upon
so
fair
so
and
amiable
a
maid
and
better
fate
did
maria
deserve
than
to
have
her
banns
forbid
by
the
intrigues
of
the
curate
of
the
parish
who
published
them
he
was
going
on
when
maria
who
had
made
a
short
pause
put
the
pipe
to
her
mouth
and
began
the
air
again
they
were
the
same
notes
yet
were
ten
times
sweeter
it
is
the
evening
service
to
the
virgin
said
the
young
man
but
who
has
taught
her
to
play
it
or
how
she
came
by
her
pipe
no
one
knows
we
think
that
heaven
has
assisted
her
in
both
for
ever
since
she
has
been
unsettled
in
her
mind
it
seems
her
only
consolation
she
has
never
once
had
the
pipe
out
of
her
hand
but
plays
that
service
upon
it
almost
night
and
day
the
postillion
delivered
this
with
so
much
discretion
and
natural
eloquence
that
i
could
not
help
decyphering
something
in
his
face
above
his
condition
and
should
have
sifted
out
his
history
had
not
poor
maria
taken
such
full
possession
of
me
we
had
got
up
by
this
time
almost
to
the
bank
where
maria
was
sitting
she
was
in
a
thin
white
jacket
with
her
hair
all
but
two
tresses
drawn
up
into
a
with
a
few
olive
leaves
twisted
a
little
fantastically
on
one
side
she
was
beautiful
and
if
ever
i
felt
the
full
force
of
an
honest
it
was
the
moment
i
saw
her
god
help
her
poor
damsel
above
a
hundred
masses
said
the
postillion
have
been
said
in
the
several
parish
churches
and
convents
around
for
her
but
without
effect
we
have
still
hopes
as
she
is
sensible
for
short
intervals
that
the
virgin
at
last
will
restore
her
to
herself
but
her
parents
who
know
her
best
are
hopeless
upon
that
score
and
think
her
senses
are
lost
for
ever
as
the
postillion
spoke
this
maria
made
a
cadence
so
melancholy
so
tender
and
querulous
that
i
sprung
out
of
the
chaise
to
help
her
and
found
myself
sitting
betwixt
her
and
her
goat
before
i
relapsed
from
my
enthusiasm
maria
look
wistfully
for
some
time
at
me
and
then
at
her
goat
and
then
at
me
and
then
at
her
goat
again
and
so
on
alternately
well
maria
said
i
softly
what
resemblance
do
you
find
i
do
entreat
the
candid
reader
to
believe
me
that
it
was
from
the
humblest
conviction
of
what
a
beast
man
is
that
i
asked
the
question
and
that
i
would
not
have
let
fallen
an
unseasonable
pleasantry
in
the
venerable
presence
of
misery
to
be
entitled
to
all
the
wit
that
ever
rabelais
scatter
and
yet
i
own
my
heart
smote
me
and
that
i
so
smarted
at
the
very
idea
of
it
that
i
swore
i
would
set
up
for
wisdom
and
utter
grave
sentences
the
rest
of
my
days
and
never
never
attempt
again
to
commit
mirth
with
man
woman
or
child
the
longest
day
i
had
to
live
as
for
writing
nonsense
to
them
i
believe
there
was
a
reserve
but
that
i
leave
to
the
world
adieu
maria
adieu
poor
hapless
damsel
some
time
but
not
now
i
may
hear
thy
sorrows
from
thy
own
lips
but
i
was
deceived
for
that
moment
she
took
her
pipe
and
told
me
such
a
tale
of
woe
with
it
that
i
rose
up
and
with
broken
and
irregular
steps
walk
softly
to
my
chaise
what
an
excellent
inn
at
moulins
chapter
when
we
have
got
to
the
end
of
this
chapter
but
not
before
we
must
all
turn
back
to
the
two
blank
chapters
on
the
account
of
which
my
honour
has
lain
bleeding
this
half
hour
i
stop
it
by
pulling
off
one
of
my
yellow
slippers
and
throwing
it
with
all
my
violence
to
the
opposite
side
of
my
room
with
a
declaration
at
the
heel
of
it
that
whatever
resemblance
it
may
bear
to
half
the
chapters
which
are
written
in
the
world
or
for
aught
i
know
may
be
now
writing
in
it
that
it
was
as
casual
as
the
foam
of
zeuxis
his
horse
besides
i
look
upon
a
chapter
which
has
only
nothing
in
it
with
respect
and
considering
what
worse
things
there
are
in
the
world
that
it
is
no
way
a
proper
subject
for
satire
why
then
was
it
left
so
and
here
without
staying
for
my
reply
shall
i
be
called
as
many
blockheads
numsculs
doddypoles
dunderheads
goosecaps
joltheads
nincompoops
and
and
other
unsavoury
appellations
as
ever
the
of
lerne
cast
in
the
teeth
of
king
garangantan
shepherds
and
i
let
them
do
it
as
bridget
said
as
much
as
they
please
for
how
was
it
possible
they
should
foresee
the
necessity
i
was
under
of
writing
the
chapter
of
my
book
before
the
c
so
i
do
take
it
amiss
all
i
wish
is
that
it
may
be
a
lesson
to
the
world
let
people
tell
their
stories
their
own
way
the
chapter
as
bridget
opened
the
door
before
the
corporal
had
well
given
the
rap
the
interval
betwixt
that
and
my
uncle
toby
introduction
into
the
parlour
was
so
short
that
wadman
had
but
just
time
to
get
from
behind
the
curtain
lay
a
bible
upon
the
table
and
advance
a
step
or
two
towards
the
door
to
receive
him
my
uncle
toby
saluted
wadman
after
the
manner
in
which
women
were
saluted
by
men
in
the
year
of
our
lord
god
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
thirteen
then
facing
about
he
march
up
abreast
with
her
to
the
sopha
and
in
three
plain
words
though
not
before
he
was
sat
down
nor
after
he
was
sat
down
but
as
he
was
sitting
down
told
her
was
in
love
so
that
my
uncle
toby
strained
himself
more
in
the
declaration
than
he
needed
wadman
naturally
looked
down
upon
a
slit
she
had
been
darning
up
in
her
apron
in
expectation
every
moment
that
my
uncle
toby
would
go
on
but
having
no
talents
for
amplification
and
love
moreover
of
all
others
being
a
subject
of
which
he
was
the
least
a
master
when
he
had
told
wadman
once
that
he
loved
her
he
let
it
alone
and
left
the
matter
to
work
after
its
own
way
my
father
was
always
in
raptures
with
this
system
of
my
uncle
toby
as
he
falsely
called
it
and
would
often
say
that
could
his
brother
toby
to
his
processe
have
added
but
a
pipe
of
tobacco
he
had
wherewithal
to
have
found
his
way
if
there
was
faith
in
a
spanish
proverb
towards
the
hearts
of
half
the
women
upon
the
globe
my
uncle
toby
never
understood
what
my
father
meant
nor
will
i
presume
to
extract
more
from
it
than
a
condemnation
of
an
error
which
the
bulk
of
the
world
lie
under
but
the
french
every
one
of
to
a
man
who
believe
in
it
almost
as
much
as
the
real
presence
talking
of
love
is
making
it
i
would
as
soon
set
about
making
a
by
the
same
receipt
let
us
go
on
wadman
sat
in
expectation
my
uncle
toby
would
do
so
to
almost
the
first
pulsation
of
that
minute
wherein
silence
on
one
side
or
the
other
generally
becomes
indecent
so
edging
herself
a
little
more
towards
him
and
raising
up
her
eyes
sub
blushing
as
she
did
it
she
took
up
the
gauntlet
or
the
discourse
if
you
like
it
better
and
communed
with
my
uncle
toby
thus
the
cares
and
disquietudes
of
the
marriage
state
quoth
wadman
are
very
great
i
suppose
so
said
my
uncle
toby
and
therefore
when
a
person
continued
wadman
is
so
much
at
his
ease
as
you
are
so
happy
captain
shandy
in
yourself
your
friends
and
your
amusements
i
wonder
what
reasons
can
incline
you
to
the
state
they
are
written
quoth
my
uncle
toby
in
the
book
thus
far
my
uncle
toby
went
on
warily
and
kept
within
his
depth
leaving
wadman
to
sail
upon
the
gulph
as
she
pleased
as
for
children
said
wadman
though
a
principal
end
perhaps
of
the
institution
and
the
natural
wish
i
suppose
of
every
parent
yet
do
not
we
all
find
they
are
certain
sorrows
and
very
uncertain
comforts
and
what
is
there
dear
sir
to
pay
one
for
the
what
compensation
for
the
many
tender
and
disquieting
apprehensions
of
a
suffering
and
defenceless
mother
who
brings
them
into
life
i
declare
said
my
uncle
toby
smit
with
pity
i
know
of
none
unless
it
be
the
pleasure
which
it
has
pleased
god
a
fiddlestick
quoth
she
chapter
now
there
are
such
an
infinitude
of
notes
tunes
cants
chants
airs
looks
and
accents
with
which
the
word
fiddlestick
may
be
pronounced
in
all
such
causes
as
this
every
one
of
impressing
a
sense
and
meaning
as
different
from
the
other
as
dirt
from
cleanliness
that
casuists
for
it
is
an
affair
of
conscience
on
that
score
reckon
up
no
less
than
fourteen
thousand
in
which
you
may
do
either
right
or
wrong
wadman
hit
upon
the
fiddlestick
which
summoned
up
all
my
uncle
toby
modest
blood
into
his
cheeks
so
feeling
within
himself
that
he
had
somehow
or
other
got
beyond
his
depth
he
stopt
short
and
without
entering
further
either
into
the
pains
or
pleasures
of
matrimony
he
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart
and
made
an
offer
to
take
them
as
they
were
and
share
them
along
with
her
when
my
uncle
toby
had
said
this
he
did
not
care
to
say
it
again
so
casting
his
eye
upon
the
bible
which
wadman
had
laid
upon
the
table
he
took
it
up
and
popping
dear
soul
upon
a
passage
in
it
of
all
others
the
most
interesting
to
him
which
was
the
siege
of
jericho
he
set
himself
to
read
it
over
leaving
his
proposal
of
marriage
as
he
had
done
his
declaration
of
love
to
work
with
her
after
its
own
way
now
it
wrought
neither
as
an
astringent
or
a
loosener
nor
like
opium
or
bark
or
mercury
or
buckthorn
or
any
one
drug
which
nature
had
bestowed
upon
the
world
in
short
it
work
not
at
all
in
her
and
the
cause
of
that
was
that
there
was
something
working
there
before
babbler
that
i
am
i
have
anticipated
what
it
was
a
dozen
times
but
there
is
fire
still
in
the
subject
allons
chapter
it
is
natural
for
a
perfect
stranger
who
is
going
from
london
to
edinburgh
to
enquire
before
he
sets
out
how
many
miles
to
york
which
is
about
the
half
way
nor
does
any
body
wonder
if
he
goes
on
and
asks
about
the
corporation
c
it
was
just
as
natural
for
wadman
whose
first
husband
was
all
his
time
afflicted
with
a
sciatica
to
wish
to
know
how
far
from
the
hip
to
the
groin
and
how
far
she
was
likely
to
suffer
more
or
less
in
her
feelings
in
the
one
case
than
in
the
other
she
had
accordingly
read
drake
anatomy
from
one
end
to
the
other
she
had
peeped
into
wharton
upon
the
brain
and
borrowed
graaf
this
must
be
a
mistake
in
shandy
for
graaf
wrote
upon
the
pancreatick
juice
and
the
parts
of
generation
upon
the
bones
and
muscles
but
could
make
nothing
of
it
she
had
reason
likewise
from
her
own
powers
laid
down
theorems
drawn
consequences
and
come
to
no
conclusion
to
clear
up
all
she
had
twice
asked
doctor
slop
poor
captain
shandy
was
ever
likely
to
recover
of
his
wound
he
is
recovered
doctor
slop
would
say
what
quite
quite
madam
but
what
do
you
mean
by
a
recovery
wadman
would
say
doctor
slop
was
the
worst
man
alive
at
definitions
and
so
wadman
could
get
no
knowledge
in
short
there
was
no
way
to
extract
it
but
from
my
uncle
toby
himself
there
is
an
accent
of
humanity
in
an
enquiry
of
this
kind
which
lulls
suspicion
to
rest
and
i
am
half
persuaded
the
serpent
got
pretty
near
it
in
his
discourse
with
eve
for
the
propensity
in
the
sex
to
be
deceived
could
not
be
so
great
that
she
should
have
boldness
to
hold
chat
with
the
devil
without
it
but
there
is
an
accent
of
humanity
how
shall
i
describe
it
is
an
accent
which
covers
the
part
with
a
garment
and
gives
the
enquirer
a
right
to
be
as
particular
with
it
as
your
was
it
without
remission
was
it
more
tolerable
in
bed
could
he
lie
on
both
sides
alike
with
it
was
he
able
to
mount
a
horse
was
motion
bad
for
it
et
caetera
were
so
tenderly
spoke
to
and
so
directed
towards
my
uncle
toby
heart
that
every
item
of
them
sunk
ten
times
deeper
into
it
than
the
evils
themselves
but
when
wadman
went
round
about
by
namur
to
get
at
my
uncle
toby
groin
and
engaged
him
to
attack
the
point
of
the
advanced
counterscarp
and
pele
mele
with
the
dutch
to
take
the
counterguard
of
roch
sword
in
hand
and
then
with
tender
notes
playing
upon
his
ear
led
him
all
bleeding
by
the
hand
out
of
the
trench
wiping
her
eye
as
he
was
carried
to
his
tent
heaven
earth
sea
all
was
lifted
up
the
springs
of
nature
rose
above
their
levels
an
angel
of
mercy
sat
besides
him
on
the
sopha
his
heart
glow
with
fire
and
had
he
been
worth
a
thousand
he
had
lost
every
heart
of
them
to
wadman
and
whereabouts
dear
sir
quoth
wadman
a
little
categorically
did
you
receive
this
sad
blow
in
asking
this
question
wadman
gave
a
slight
glance
towards
the
waistband
of
my
uncle
toby
red
plush
breeches
expecting
naturally
as
the
shortest
reply
to
it
that
my
uncle
toby
would
lay
his
upon
the
place
it
fell
out
otherwise
for
my
uncle
toby
having
got
his
wound
before
the
gate
of
nicolas
in
one
of
the
traverses
of
the
trench
opposite
to
the
salient
angle
of
the
demibastion
of
roch
he
could
at
any
time
stick
a
pin
upon
the
identical
spot
of
ground
where
he
was
standing
when
the
stone
struck
him
this
struck
instantly
upon
my
uncle
toby
sensorium
and
with
it
struck
his
large
map
of
the
town
and
citadel
of
namur
and
its
environs
which
he
had
purchased
and
pasted
down
upon
a
board
by
the
corporal
aid
during
his
long
illness
it
had
lain
with
other
military
lumber
in
the
garret
ever
since
and
accordingly
the
corporal
was
detached
to
the
garret
to
fetch
it
my
uncle
toby
measured
off
thirty
toises
with
wadman
scissars
from
the
returning
angle
before
the
gate
of
nicolas
and
with
such
a
virgin
modesty
laid
her
finger
upon
the
place
that
the
goddess
of
decency
if
then
in
being
if
not
was
her
shade
shook
her
head
and
with
a
finger
wavering
across
her
eyes
forbid
her
to
explain
the
mistake
unhappy
wadman
for
nothing
can
make
this
chapter
go
off
with
spirit
but
an
apostrophe
to
thee
but
my
heart
tells
me
that
in
such
a
crisis
an
apostrophe
is
but
an
insult
in
disguise
and
ere
i
would
offer
one
to
a
woman
in
distress
let
the
chapter
go
to
the
devil
provided
any
damn
critic
in
keeping
will
be
but
at
the
trouble
to
take
it
with
him
chapter
my
uncle
toby
map
is
carried
down
into
the
kitchen
chapter
and
here
is
the
maes
and
this
is
the
sambre
said
the
corporal
pointing
with
his
right
hand
extended
a
little
towards
the
map
and
his
left
upon
bridget
shoulder
but
not
the
shoulder
next
him
and
this
said
he
is
the
town
of
namur
and
this
the
citadel
and
there
lay
the
french
and
here
lay
his
honour
and
myself
and
in
this
cursed
trench
bridget
quoth
the
corporal
taking
her
by
the
hand
did
he
receive
the
wound
which
crush
him
so
miserably
in
pronouncing
which
he
slightly
press
the
back
of
her
hand
towards
the
part
he
felt
for
and
let
it
fall
we
thought
mr
trim
it
had
been
more
in
the
middle
said
bridget
that
would
have
undone
us
for
ever
said
the
corporal
and
left
my
poor
mistress
undone
too
said
bridget
the
corporal
made
no
reply
to
the
repartee
but
by
giving
bridget
a
kiss
come
come
said
bridget
holding
the
palm
of
her
left
hand
parallel
to
the
plane
of
the
horizon
and
sliding
the
fingers
of
the
other
over
it
in
a
way
which
could
not
have
been
done
had
there
been
the
least
wart
or
protruberance
is
every
syllable
of
it
false
cried
the
corporal
before
she
had
half
finished
the
sentence
i
know
it
to
be
fact
said
bridget
from
credible
witnesses
upon
my
honour
said
the
corporal
laying
his
hand
upon
his
heart
and
blushing
as
he
spoke
with
honest
resentment
is
a
story
bridget
as
false
as
hell
not
said
bridget
interrupting
him
that
either
i
or
my
mistress
care
a
halfpenny
about
it
whether
is
so
or
no
only
that
when
one
is
married
one
would
chuse
to
have
such
a
thing
by
one
at
least
it
was
somewhat
unfortunate
for
bridget
that
she
had
begun
the
attack
with
her
manual
exercise
for
the
corporal
instantly
chapter
it
was
like
the
momentary
contest
in
the
moist
of
an
april
morning
bridget
should
laugh
or
cry
she
snatch
up
a
was
ten
to
one
she
had
laugh
she
laid
it
down
she
cried
and
had
one
single
tear
of
but
tasted
of
bitterness
full
sorrowful
would
the
corporal
heart
have
been
that
he
had
used
the
argument
but
the
corporal
understood
the
sex
a
quart
major
to
a
terce
at
least
better
than
my
uncle
toby
and
accordingly
he
assailed
bridget
after
this
manner
i
know
bridget
said
the
corporal
giving
her
a
most
respectful
kiss
that
thou
art
good
and
modest
by
nature
and
art
withal
so
generous
a
girl
in
thyself
that
if
i
know
thee
rightly
thou
not
wound
an
insect
much
less
the
honour
of
so
gallant
and
worthy
a
soul
as
my
master
wast
thou
sure
to
be
made
a
countess
of
but
thou
hast
been
set
on
and
deluded
dear
bridget
as
is
often
a
woman
case
please
others
more
than
themselves
bridget
eyes
poured
down
at
the
sensations
the
corporal
excited
tell
me
tell
me
then
my
dear
bridget
continued
the
corporal
taking
hold
of
her
hand
which
hung
down
dead
by
her
side
and
giving
a
second
kiss
whose
suspicion
has
misled
thee
bridget
sobb
a
sob
or
two
then
open
her
eyes
the
corporal
wiped
with
the
bottom
of
her
apron
she
then
open
her
heart
and
told
him
all
chapter
my
uncle
toby
and
the
corporal
had
gone
on
separately
with
their
operations
the
greatest
part
of
the
campaign
and
as
effectually
cut
off
from
all
communication
of
what
either
the
one
or
the
other
had
been
doing
as
if
they
had
been
separated
from
each
other
by
the
maes
or
the
sambre
my
uncle
toby
on
his
side
had
presented
himself
every
afternoon
in
his
red
and
silver
and
blue
and
gold
alternately
and
sustained
an
infinity
of
attacks
in
them
without
knowing
them
to
be
attacks
and
so
had
nothing
to
communicate
the
corporal
on
his
side
in
taking
bridget
by
it
had
considerable
advantages
and
consequently
had
much
to
communicate
but
what
were
the
advantages
as
well
as
what
was
the
manner
by
which
he
had
seiz
them
required
so
nice
an
historian
that
the
corporal
durst
not
venture
upon
it
and
as
sensible
as
he
was
of
glory
would
rather
have
been
contented
to
have
gone
bareheaded
and
without
laurels
for
ever
than
torture
his
master
modesty
for
a
single
moment
best
of
honest
and
gallant
servants
but
i
have
apostrophiz
thee
trim
once
before
and
could
i
apotheosize
thee
also
that
is
to
say
with
good
company
i
would
do
it
without
ceremony
in
the
very
next
page
chapter
now
my
uncle
toby
had
one
evening
laid
down
his
pipe
upon
the
table
and
was
counting
over
to
himself
upon
his
finger
ends
beginning
at
his
thumb
all
wadman
perfections
one
by
one
and
happening
two
or
three
times
together
either
by
omitting
some
or
counting
others
twice
over
to
puzzle
himself
sadly
before
he
could
get
beyond
his
middle
finger
prithee
trim
said
he
taking
up
his
pipe
again
bring
me
a
pen
and
ink
trim
brought
paper
also
take
a
full
sheet
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
making
a
sign
with
his
pipe
at
the
same
time
to
take
a
chair
and
sit
down
close
by
him
at
the
table
the
corporal
obeyed
placed
the
paper
directly
before
him
took
a
pen
and
dipp
it
in
the
ink
she
has
a
thousand
virtues
trim
said
my
uncle
toby
am
i
to
set
them
down
an
please
your
honour
quoth
the
corporal
but
they
must
be
taken
in
their
ranks
replied
my
uncle
toby
for
of
them
all
trim
that
which
wins
me
most
and
which
is
a
security
for
all
the
rest
is
the
compassionate
turn
and
singular
humanity
of
her
character
i
protest
added
my
uncle
toby
looking
up
as
he
protested
it
towards
the
top
of
the
ceiling
that
was
i
her
brother
trim
a
thousand
fold
she
could
not
make
more
constant
or
more
tender
enquiries
after
my
sufferings
though
now
no
more
the
corporal
made
no
reply
to
my
uncle
toby
protestation
but
by
a
short
cough
he
dipp
the
pen
a
second
time
into
the
inkhorn
and
my
uncle
toby
pointing
with
the
end
of
his
pipe
as
close
to
the
top
of
the
sheet
at
the
left
hand
corner
of
it
as
he
could
get
it
the
corporal
wrote
down
the
word
humanity
thus
prithee
corporal
said
my
uncle
toby
as
soon
as
trim
had
done
it
how
often
does
bridget
enquire
after
the
wound
on
the
cap
of
thy
knee
which
thou
at
the
battle
of
landen
she
never
an
please
your
honour
enquires
after
it
at
all
that
corporal
said
my
uncle
toby
with
all
the
triumph
the
goodness
of
his
nature
would
permit
that
shews
the
difference
in
the
character
of
the
mistress
and
maid
had
the
fortune
of
war
allotted
the
same
mischance
to
me
wadman
would
have
enquired
into
every
circumstance
relating
to
it
a
hundred
times
she
would
have
enquired
an
please
your
honour
ten
times
as
often
about
your
honour
groin
the
pain
trim
is
equally
excruciating
and
compassion
has
as
much
to
do
with
the
one
as
the
other
god
bless
your
honour
cried
the
corporal
what
has
a
compassion
to
do
with
a
wound
upon
the
cap
of
a
man
knee
had
your
honour
been
shot
into
ten
thousand
splinters
at
the
affair
of
landen
wadman
would
have
troubled
her
head
as
little
about
it
as
bridget
because
added
the
corporal
lowering
his
voice
and
speaking
very
distinctly
as
he
assigned
his
reason
knee
is
such
a
distance
from
the
main
body
whereas
the
groin
your
honour
knows
is
upon
the
very
curtain
of
the
place
my
uncle
toby
gave
a
long
whistle
but
in
a
note
which
could
scarce
be
heard
across
the
table
the
corporal
had
advanced
too
far
to
retire
in
three
words
he
told
the
rest
my
uncle
toby
laid
down
his
pipe
as
gently
upon
the
fender
as
if
it
had
been
spun
from
the
unravellings
of
a
spider
web
let
us
go
to
my
brother
shandy
said
he
chapter
there
will
be
just
time
whilst
my
uncle
toby
and
trim
are
walking
to
my
father
to
inform
you
that
wadman
had
some
moons
before
this
made
a
confident
of
my
mother
and
that
bridget
who
had
the
burden
of
her
own
as
well
as
her
mistress
secret
to
carry
had
got
happily
delivered
of
both
to
susannah
behind
the
as
for
my
mother
she
saw
nothing
at
all
in
it
to
make
the
least
bustle
about
but
susannah
was
sufficient
by
herself
for
all
the
ends
and
purposes
you
could
possibly
have
in
exporting
a
family
secret
for
she
instantly
imparted
it
by
signs
to
jonathan
and
jonathan
by
tokens
to
the
cook
as
she
was
basting
a
loin
of
mutton
the
cook
sold
it
with
some
to
the
postillion
for
a
groat
who
truck
it
with
the
dairy
maid
for
something
of
about
the
same
value
and
though
whisper
in
the
fame
caught
the
notes
with
her
brazen
trumpet
and
sounded
them
upon
the
in
a
word
not
an
old
woman
in
the
village
or
five
miles
round
who
did
not
understand
the
difficulties
of
my
uncle
toby
siege
and
what
were
the
secret
articles
which
had
delayed
the
my
father
whose
way
was
to
force
every
event
in
nature
into
an
hypothesis
by
which
means
never
man
crucified
truth
at
the
rate
he
did
had
but
just
heard
of
the
report
as
my
uncle
toby
set
out
and
catching
fire
suddenly
at
the
trespass
done
his
brother
by
it
was
demonstrating
to
yorick
notwithstanding
my
mother
was
sitting
by
not
only
the
devil
was
in
women
and
that
the
whole
of
the
affair
was
lust
but
that
every
evil
and
disorder
in
the
world
of
what
kind
or
nature
soever
from
the
first
fall
of
adam
down
to
my
uncle
inclusive
was
owing
one
way
or
other
to
the
same
unruly
appetite
yorick
was
just
bringing
my
father
hypothesis
to
some
temper
when
my
uncle
toby
entering
the
room
with
marks
of
infinite
benevolence
and
forgiveness
in
his
looks
my
father
eloquence
against
the
passion
and
as
he
was
not
very
nice
in
the
choice
of
his
words
when
he
was
wroth
as
soon
as
my
uncle
toby
was
seated
by
the
fire
and
had
filled
his
pipe
my
father
broke
out
in
this
manner
chapter
that
provision
should
be
made
for
continuing
the
race
of
so
great
so
exalted
and
godlike
a
being
as
man
i
am
far
from
denying
but
philosophy
speaks
freely
of
every
thing
and
therefore
i
still
think
and
do
maintain
it
to
be
a
pity
that
it
should
be
done
by
means
of
a
passion
which
bends
down
the
faculties
and
turns
all
the
wisdom
contemplations
and
operations
of
the
soul
backwards
a
passion
my
dear
continued
my
father
addressing
himself
to
my
mother
which
couples
and
equals
wise
men
with
fools
and
makes
us
come
out
of
our
caverns
and
more
like
satyrs
and
beasts
than
men
i
know
it
will
be
said
continued
my
father
availing
himself
of
the
prolepsis
that
in
itself
and
simply
taken
like
hunger
or
thirst
or
sleep
is
an
affair
neither
good
or
bad
or
shameful
or
why
then
did
the
delicacy
of
diogenes
and
plato
so
recalcitrate
against
it
and
wherefore
when
we
go
about
to
make
and
plant
a
man
do
we
put
out
the
candle
and
for
what
reason
is
it
that
all
the
parts
thereof
the
congredients
the
preparations
the
instruments
and
whatever
serves
thereto
are
so
held
as
to
be
conveyed
to
a
cleanly
mind
by
no
language
translation
or
periphrasis
whatever
the
act
of
killing
and
destroying
a
man
continued
my
father
raising
his
voice
and
turning
to
my
uncle
toby
you
see
is
glorious
and
the
weapons
by
which
we
do
it
are
honourable
we
march
with
them
upon
our
shoulders
we
strut
with
them
by
our
sides
we
gild
them
we
carve
them
we
them
we
enrich
them
nay
if
it
be
but
a
scoundrel
cannon
we
cast
an
ornament
upon
the
breach
of
my
uncle
toby
laid
down
his
pipe
to
intercede
for
a
better
epithet
and
yorick
was
rising
up
to
batter
the
whole
hypothesis
to
pieces
when
obadiah
broke
into
the
middle
of
the
room
with
a
complaint
which
cried
out
for
an
immediate
hearing
the
case
was
this
my
father
whether
by
ancient
custom
of
the
manor
or
as
impropriator
of
the
great
tythes
was
obliged
to
keep
a
bull
for
the
service
of
the
parish
and
obadiah
had
led
his
cow
upon
a
to
him
one
day
or
other
the
preceding
summer
i
say
one
day
or
other
because
as
chance
would
have
it
it
was
the
day
on
which
he
was
married
to
my
so
one
was
a
reckoning
to
the
other
therefore
when
obadiah
wife
was
brought
to
bed
obadiah
thanked
god
now
said
obadiah
i
shall
have
a
calf
so
obadiah
went
daily
to
visit
his
cow
she
calve
on
monday
on
tuesday
on
wednesday
at
the
farthest
the
cow
did
not
calve
no
she
not
calve
till
next
week
the
cow
put
it
off
terribly
till
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
week
obadiah
suspicions
like
a
good
man
fell
upon
the
bull
now
the
parish
being
very
large
my
father
bull
to
speak
the
truth
of
him
was
no
way
equal
to
the
department
he
had
however
got
himself
somehow
or
other
thrust
into
employment
and
as
he
went
through
the
business
with
a
grave
face
my
father
had
a
high
opinion
of
him
most
of
the
townsmen
an
please
your
worship
quoth
obadiah
believe
that
is
all
the
bull
fault
but
may
not
a
cow
be
barren
replied
my
father
turning
to
doctor
slop
it
never
happens
said
slop
but
the
man
wife
may
have
come
before
her
time
naturally
enough
prithee
has
the
child
hair
upon
his
head
added
slop
it
is
as
hairy
as
i
am
said
obadiah
had
not
been
shaved
for
three
weeks
wheu
u
u
cried
my
father
beginning
the
sentence
with
an
exclamatory
whistle
and
so
brother
toby
this
poor
bull
of
mine
who
is
as
good
a
bull
as
ever
and
might
have
done
for
europa
herself
in
purer
times
had
he
but
two
legs
less
might
have
been
driven
into
doctors
commons
and
lost
his
character
which
to
a
town
bull
brother
toby
is
the
very
same
thing
as
his
life
said
my
mother
what
is
all
this
story
about
a
cock
and
a
bull
said
yorick
and
one
of
the
best
of
its
kind
i
ever
heard

of
the
fourth
volume
