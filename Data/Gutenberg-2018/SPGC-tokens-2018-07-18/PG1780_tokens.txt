twelvemonth
old
and
bootless
is
to
tell
you
we
will
go
therefore
we
meet
not
now
then
let
me
hear
of
you
my
gentle
cousin
westmoreland
what
yesternight
our
council
did
decree
in
forwarding
this
dear
expedience
west
my
liege
this
haste
was
hot
in
question
and
many
limits
of
the
charge
set
down
but
yesternight
when
all
athwart
there
came
a
post
from
wales
loaden
with
heavy
news
whose
worst
was
that
the
noble
mortimer
leading
the
men
of
herefordshire
to
fight
against
the
irregular
and
wild
glendower
was
by
the
rude
hands
of
that
welshman
taken
a
thousand
of
his
people
butchered
upon
whose
dead
corpse
there
was
such
misuse
such
beastly
shameless
transformation
by
those
welshwomen
done
as
may
not
be
without
much
shame
retold
or
spoken
of
king
it
seems
then
that
the
tidings
of
this
broil
brake
off
our
business
for
the
holy
land
west
this
match
with
other
did
my
gracious
lord
for
more
uneven
and
unwelcome
news
came
from
the
north
and
thus
it
did
import
on
day
the
gallant
hotspur
there
young
harry
percy
and
brave
archibald
that
and
approved
scot
at
holmedon
met
where
they
did
spend
a
sad
and
bloody
hour
as
by
discharge
of
their
artillery
and
shape
of
likelihood
the
news
was
told
for
he
that
brought
them
in
the
very
heat
and
pride
of
their
contention
did
take
horse
uncertain
of
the
issue
any
way
king
here
is
a
dear
a
friend
sir
walter
blunt
new
lighted
from
his
horse
stain
with
the
variation
of
each
soil
betwixt
that
holmedon
and
this
seat
of
ours
and
he
hath
brought
us
smooth
and
welcome
news
the
earl
of
douglas
is
discomfited
ten
thousand
bold
scots
knights
balk
in
their
own
blood
did
sir
walter
see
on
holmedon
plains
of
prisoners
hotspur
took
mordake
earl
of
fife
and
eldest
son
to
beaten
douglas
and
the
earl
of
athol
of
murray
angus
and
menteith
and
is
not
this
an
honourable
spoil
a
gallant
prize
ha
cousin
is
it
not
west
in
faith
it
is
a
conquest
for
a
prince
to
boast
of
king
yea
there
thou
me
sad
and
me
sin
in
envy
that
my
lord
northumberland
should
be
the
father
to
so
blest
a
a
son
who
is
the
theme
of
honour
tongue
amongst
a
grove
the
very
straightest
plant
who
is
sweet
fortune
minion
and
her
pride
whilst
i
by
looking
on
the
praise
of
him
see
riot
and
dishonour
stain
the
brow
of
my
young
harry
o
that
it
could
be
that
some
fairy
had
in
cradle
clothes
our
children
where
they
lay
and
call
mine
percy
his
plantagenet
then
would
i
have
his
harry
and
he
mine
but
let
him
from
my
thoughts
what
think
you
coz
of
this
young
percy
pride
the
prisoners
which
he
in
this
adventure
hath
to
his
own
use
he
keeps
and
sends
me
word
i
shall
have
none
but
mordake
earl
of
fife
west
this
is
his
uncle
teaching
this
worcester
malevolent
to
you
in
all
aspects
which
makes
him
prune
himself
and
bristle
up
the
crest
of
youth
against
your
dignity
king
but
i
have
sent
for
him
to
answer
this
and
for
this
cause
awhile
we
must
neglect
our
holy
purpose
to
jerusalem
cousin
on
wednesday
next
our
council

will
hold
at

so
inform
the
lords

jest
to

that
i
can
not
manage

falstaff
bardolph
peto
and
gadshill
shall
rob
those
men
that
we
have
already
waylaid

i
will
not
be

when
they
have
the
booty
if
you
and
i
do
not
rob
them
cut
this
head
off
from
my
shoulders
prince
how
shall
we
part
with
them
in
setting
forth
poins
why
we
will
set
forth
before
or
after
them
and
appoint
them
a
place
of
meeting
wherein
it
is
at
our
pleasure
to
fail
and
then
will
they
adventure
upon
the
exploit
themselves
which
they
shall
have
no
sooner
achieved
but
we
set
upon
them
prince
yea
but
is
like
that
they
will
know
us
by
our
horses
by
our
habits
and
by
every
other
appointment
to
be
ourselves
poins
tut
our
horses
they
shall
not
i
tie
them
in
the
wood
our
wizards
we
will
change
after
we
leave
them
and
sirrah
i
have
cases
of
buckram
for
the
nonce
to
immask
our
noted
outward
garments
prince
yea
but
i
doubt
they
will
be
too
hard
for
us
poins
well
for
two
of
them
i
know
them
to
be
as
cowards
as
ever
turn
back
and
for
the
third
if
he
fight
longer
than
he
sees
reason
i
forswear
arms
the
virtue
of
this
jest
will
lie
the
incomprehensible
lies
that
this
same
fat
rogue
will
tell
us
when
we
meet
at
supper
how
thirty
at
least
he
fought
with
what
wards
what
blows
what
extremities
he
endured
and
in
the
reproof
of
this
lies
the
jest
prince
well
i
go
with
thee
provide
us
all
things
necessary
and
meet
me
in
eastcheap
there
i
sup
farewell
poins
farewell
my
lord
exit
prince
i
know
you
all
and
will
awhile
uphold
the
unyok
humour
of
your
idleness
yet
herein
will
i
imitate
the
sun
who
doth
permit
the
base
contagious
clouds
to
smother
up
his
beauty
from
the
world
that
when
he
please
again
to
lie
himself
being
wanted
he
may
be
more
at
by
breaking
through
the
foul
and
ugly
mists
of
vapours
that
did
seem
to
strangle
him
if
all
the
year
were
playing
holidays
to

they
come

when
this

i
throw
off

never
promised

my

no

sir
walter
blunt
with

king
my
blood
hath
been
too
cold
and
temperate
unapt
to
stir
at
these
indignities
and
you
have
found
me
for
accordingly
you
tread
upon
my
patience
but
be
sure
i
will
from
henceforth
rather
be
myself
mighty
and
to

fear
than
my
condition
which
hath
been
smooth
as
oil
soft
as
young
down
and
therefore
lost
that
title
of
respect
which
the
proud
soul
pays

to
the
proud
wor
our

my
sovereign

little
deserves

get
thee
gone

i
do
see
danger
and
disobedience
in
thine
eye
o
sir
your
presence
is
too
bold
and
peremptory
and
majesty
might
never

endure
the
moody

of

have
good
leave
to

shall

exit
worcester
you
were
about
to
speak
north
yea
my
good
lord
those
prisoners
in
your
highness
name
demanded
which
harry
percy
here
at
holmedon
took
were
as
he
says
not
with
such
strength
denied
as
is
delivered
to
your
majesty
either
envy
therefore
or
misprision
is
guilty
of
this
fault
and
not
my
son
hot
my
liege
i
did
deny
no
prisoners
but
i
remember
when
the
fight
was
done
when
i
was
dry
with
rage
and
extreme
toll
breathless
and
faint
leaning
upon
my
sword
came
there
a
certain
lord
neat
and
trimly
dress
fresh
as
a
bridegroom
and
his
chin
new
show
like
a
stubble
land
at
harvest
home
he
was
perfumed
like
a
milliner
and
his
finger
and
his
thumb
he
held
a
pouncet
box
which
ever
and
anon
he
gave
his
nose
and
away
again
who
therewith
angry
when
it
next
came
there
took
it
in
snuff
and
still
he
smil
and
talk
and
as
the
soldiers
bore
dead
bodies
by
he
call
them
untaught
knaves
unmannerly
to
bring
a
slovenly
unhandsome
corse
betwixt
the
wind
and
his
nobility
with
many
holiday
and
lady
terms
he
questioned
me
amongst
the
rest
demanded
my
prisoners
in
your
majesty
behalf
i
then
all
smarting
with
my
wounds
being
cold
to
be
so
with
a
popingay
out
of
my
grief
and
my
impatience
answer
neglectingly
i
know
not
he
should
or
he
should
not
for
he
made
me
mad
to
see
him
shine
so
brisk
and
smell
so
sweet
and
talk
so
like
a
waiting
gentlewoman
of
guns
and
drums
and
god
save
the
mark
and
telling
me
the
sovereignest
thing
on
earth
was
parmacity
for
an
inward
bruise
and
that
it
was
great
pity
so
it
was
this
villanous
saltpetre
should
be
out
of
the
bowels
of
the
harmless
earth
which
many
a
good
tall
fellow
had
so
cowardly
and
but
for
these
vile
he
would
himself
have
been
a
soldier
this
bald
unjointed
chat
of
his
my
lord
i
answered
indirectly
as
i
said
and
i
beseech
you
let
not
his
report
come
current
for
an
accusation
betwixt
my
love
and
your
high
majesty
blunt
the
circumstance
considered
good
my
lord
lord
harry
percy
then
had
said
to
such
a
person
and
in
such
a
place
at
such
a
time
with
all
the
rest
retold
may
reasonably
die
and
never
rise
to
do
him
wrong
or
any
way
impeach
what
then
he
said
so
he
unsay
it
now
king
why
yet
he
doth
deny
his
prisoners
but
with
proviso
and
exception
that
we
at
our
own
charge
shall
ransom
straight
his
the
foolish
mortimer
who
on
my
soul
hath
wilfully
the
lives
of
those
that
he
did
lead
to
fight
against
that
great
magician
damn
glendower
whose
daughter
as
we
hear
the
earl
of
march
hath
lately
married
shall
our
coffers
then
be
emptied
to
redeem
a
traitor
home
shall
we
buy
treason
and
indent
with
fears
when
they
have
lost
and
forfeited
themselves
no
on
the
barren
mountains
let
him
starve
for
i
shall
never
hold
that
man
my
friend
whose
tongue
shall
ask
me
for
one
penny
cost
to
ransom
home
revolted
mortimer
hot
revolted
mortimer
he
never
did
fall
off
my
sovereign
liege
but
by
the
chance
of
war
to
prove
that
true
needs
no
more
but
one
tongue
for
all
those
wounds
those
mouthed
wounds
which
valiantly
he
took
when
on
the
gentle
severn
sedgy
bank
in
single
opposition
hand
to
hand
he
did
confound
the
best
part
of
an
hour
in
changing
hardiment
with
great
glendower
three
times
they
breath
and
three
times
did
they
drink
upon
agreement
of
swift
severn
flood
who
then
affrighted
with
their
bloody
looks
ran
fearfully
among
the
trembling
reeds
and
hid
his
crisp
head
in
the
hollow
bank
bloodstained
with
these
valiant
cohabitants
never
did
base
and
rotten
policy
colour
her
working
with
such
deadly
wounds
nor
never
could
the
noble
mortimer
receive
so
many
and
all
willingly
then
let
not
him
be
slandered
with
revolt
king
thou
dost
belie
him
percy
thou
dost
belie

never
did

with

empty
all
these
veins

dust
but
i
will
lift
the
downtrod
mortimer
as
high
in

this
unthankful
king
as
this
ingrate
and
bolingbroke
north

king
hath
made
your
nephew

wor
who
struck

heat
up
after

forsooth
have
all
my
prisoners
and
when
i
urg
the
ransom
once
again
of
my
wive
brother
then
his
cheek
look
pale
and
on
my
face
he
turn
an
eye
of
death
trembling
even
at
the
name
of
mortimer
wor
i
can
not
blame
him
was
not
he
by
richard
that
dead
is
the
next
of
blood
north
he
was
i
heard
the
proclamation
and
then
it
was
when
the
unhappy
king
whose
wrongs
in
us
god
pardon
did
set
forth
upon
his
irish
expedition
from
whence
he
intercepted
did
return
to
be
depos
and
shortly
murdered
wor
and
for
whose
death
we
in
the
world
wide
mouth
live
scandaliz
and
foully
spoken
of
hot
but
soft
i
pray
you
did
king
richard
then
proclaim
my
brother
edmund
mortimer
heir
to
the
crown
north
he
did
myself
did
hear
it
hot
nay
then
i
can
not
blame
his
cousin
king
that
wish
him
on
the
barren
mountains
starve
but
shall
it
be
that
you
that
set
the
crown
upon
the
head
of
this
forgetful
man
and
for
his
sake
wear
the
detested
blot
of
murtherous
shall
it
be
that
you
a
world
of
curses
undergo
being
the
agents
or
base
second
means
the
cords
the
ladder
or
the
hangman
rather
o
pardon
me
that
i
descend
so
low
to
show
the
line
and
the
predicament
wherein
you
range
under
this
subtile
king
shall
it
for
shame
be
spoken
in
these
days
or
fill
up
chronicles
in
time
to
come
that
men
of
your
nobility
and
power
did
gage
them
both
in
an
unjust
behalf
as
both
of
you
god
pardon
it
have
done
to
put
down
richard
that
sweet
lovely
rose
and
plant
this
thorn
this
canker
bolingbroke
and
shall
it
in
more
shame
be
further
spoken
that
you
are
fool
discarded
and
shook
off
by
him
for
whom
these
shames
ye
underwent
no
yet
time
serves
wherein
you
may
redeem
your
banish
honours
and
restore
yourselves
into
the
good
thoughts
of
the
world
again
revenge
the
jeering
and
disdain
contempt
of
this
proud
king
who
studies
day
and
night
to
answer
all
the
debt
he
owes
to
you
even
with
the
bloody
payment
of
your
deaths
therefore
i
wor
peace
cousin
say
no
more
and
now
i
will
unclasp
a
secret
book
and
to
your
discontents
i
read
you
matter
deep
and
dangerous
as
full
of
peril
and
adventurous
spirit
as
to
a
current
roaring
loud
on
the
unsteadfast
footing
of
a
spear
hot
if
he
fall
in
good
night
or
sink
or
swim
send
danger
from
the
east
unto
the
west
so
honour
cross
it
from
the
north
to
south
and
let
them
grapple
o
the
blood
more
stirs
to
rouse
a
lion
than
to
start
a
hare
north
imagination
of
some
great
exploit
drives
him
beyond
the
bounds
of
patience
hot
by
heaven
methinks
it
were
an
easy
leap
to
pluck
bright
honour
from
the
moon
or
dive
into
the
bottom
of
the
deep
where
fadom
line
could
never
touch
the
ground
and
pluck
up
drowned
honour
by
the
locks
so
he
that
doth
redeem
her
thence
might
wear
without
corrival
all
her
dignities
but
out
upon
this
fellowship
wor
he
apprehends
a
world
of
figures
here
but
not
the
form
of
what
he
should
attend

me
audience
for
a
while

lend
no
ear
unto
my
purposes

would
not

will
find
him
when

lies
asleep

you

the

if
you
suppose
as
fearing
you
it
shook
glend
the
heavens
were
all
on
fire
the
earth
did
tremble
hot
o
then
the
earth
shook
to
see
the
heavens
on
fire
and
not
in
fear
of
your
nativity
diseased
nature
oftentimes
breaks
forth
in
strange
eruptions

the
teeming
earth
is
with
a
kind
of
colic
pinch
and
by
the
imprisoning
of
unruly
wind
within
her
womb
which
for
enlargement
striving
shakes
the
old
beldame
earth

topples
down
steeples
and
mossgrown
towers

the
front
of

was
full
of
fiery
shapes
the
goats
ran
from
the
mountains
and
the
herds
were
strangely
clamorous
to
the
frighted
fields
these
signs
have
mark
me
extraordinary
and
all
the
courses
of
my

had
rather

brazen
canstick

axletree
and
that
would
set
my
teeth

how
you
cross
my
father
hot
i
can
not
choose
sometimes
he
angers
me
with
telling
me
of
the
moldwarp
and
the
ant
of
the
dreamer
merlin
and
his
prophecies
and
of
a
dragon
and
a
finless
fish
a
griffin
and
a
moulten
raven
a
couching
lion
and
a
ramping
cat
and
such
a
deal
of
stuff
as
puts
me
from
my
faith
i
tell
you
he
held
me
last
night
at
least
nine
hours
in
reckoning
up
the
several
devils
names
that
were
his
lackeys
i
cried
and
go
to

mark
him
not
a
word
o
he
is
as
tedious
as
a
tired
horse
a
railing
wife
worse
than
a
smoky
house
i
had
rather
live
with
cheese
and
garlic
in
a
windmill
far
than
feed
on
cates
and
have
him
talk
to
me
in
any
summer
house
in
christendom
mort
in
faith
he
is
a
worthy
gentleman
exceedingly
well
read
and
profited
in
strange
concealments
valiant
as
a
lion
and
wondrous
affable
and
as
bountiful
as
mines
of
india
shall
i
tell
you
cousin
he
holds
your
temper
in
a
high
respect
and
curbs
himself
even
of
his
natural
scope
when
you
come
his
humour
faith
he
does
i
warrant
you
that
man
is
not
alive
might
so
have
tempted
him
as
you
have
done
without
the
taste
of
danger
and
reproof

do
not
use
it
oft
let
me
entreat
you
wor

my
lord
you
are
too

since
your
coming

must
needs
learn
lord
to
amend
this
fault
though
sometimes
it
show
greatness
courage
and
that
the
dearest
grace
it
renders
yet
oftentimes
it
doth
present
harsh
rage
defect
of
manners
want
of
government
pride
haughtiness
opinion
and
disdain
the
least
of
which
haunting
a
nobleman
loseth
men
hearts

leaves
behind
a
stain
upon

thou

your

i
could

offences
with
as
clear
excuse
as
well
as
i

doubtless
i
can
purge
myself
of

which
oft
the

of

bear

my

hath
faulty
and
irregular
and
pardon
on

true
submission
king
god
pardon
thee
yet
let
me
wonder
harry
at
thy
affections
which
do
hold
a
wing
quite
from
the
flight
of
all
thy
ancestors
thy
place
in
council
thou
hast
rudely
lost
which
by
thy
younger
brother
is
supplied
and
art
almost
an
alien
to
the
hearts
of
all
the
court
and
princes
of
my
blood
the
hope
and
expectation
of
thy
time
is
ruin
and
the
soul
of
every
man
prophetically
do
forethink
thy
fall
had
i
so
lavish
of
my
presence
been
so
in
the
eyes
of
men
so
stale
and
cheap
to
vulgar
company
opinion
that
did
help
me
to
the
crown
had
still
kept
loyal
to
possession
and
left
me
in
reputeless
banishment
a
fellow
of
no
mark
nor
likelihood
by
being
seldom
seen
i
could
not
stir
but
like
a
comet
i
was
at
that
men
would
tell
their
children
is
he
others
would
say
which
is
bolingbroke
and
then
i
stole
all
courtesy
from
heaven
and
dress
myself
in
such
humility
that
i
did
pluck
allegiance
from
men
hearts
loud
shouts
and
salutations
from
their
mouths
even
in
the
presence
of
the
crowned
king
thus
did
i
keep
my
person
fresh
and
new
my
presence
like
a
robe
pontifical
seen
but
at
and
so
my
state
seldom
but
sumptuous

won
by
rareness

ambled
up

down

shallow
jesters

rash
bavin
wits
soon
kindled
and
soon
burnt
carded
his
state
mingled
his
royalty
with
fools
had
his
great
name
profaned
with
their
scorns
and
gave
his
countenance
against
his
name
to
laugh
at
gibing
boys
and
stand
the
push
of
every
beardless
vain
comparative
grew
a
companion
to
the
common
streets
enfeoff
himself
to
popularity
that
being
dally
swallowed
by
men
eyes
they
surfeited
with
honey
and
began
to
loathe
the
taste
of
sweetness
whereof
a
little
more
than
a
little
is
by
much
too
much
so
when
he
had
occasion
to
be
seen
he
was
but
as
the
cuckoo
is
in
june
heard
not
seen
but
with
such
eyes
as
sick
and
blunted
with
community
afford
no
extraordinary
gaze
such
as
is
bent
on
unlike
majesty
when
it
shines
seldom
in
admiring
eyes
but
rather
drows
and
hung
their
eyelids
down
slept
in
his
face
and
such
aspect
as
cloudy

their

full

mine

he
did
my
lord
four
days
ere
i
set
forth
and
at
the
time
of
my
departure
thence
he
was
much
fear
by
his
physicians
wor
i
would
the
state
of
time
had
first
been
whole
ere
he
by
sickness
had
been
visited
his
health
was
never
better
worth
than
now
hot
sick
now
droop
now
this
sickness
doth
infect
the
very
lifeblood
of
our
enterprise
is
catching
hither
even
to
our
camp
he
writes
me
here
that
inward
and
that
his
friends
by
deputation
could
not
so
soon
be
drawn
no
did
he
think
it
meet
to
lay
so
dangerous
and
dear
a
trust
on
any
soul
remov
but
on
his
own
yet
doth
he
give
us
bold
advertisement
that
with
our
small
conjunction
we
should
on
to
see
how
fortune
is
dispos
to
us
for
as
he
writes
there
is
no
quailing
now
because
the
king
is
certainly
of
all
our
purposes
what
say
you
to
it
wor
your
father
sickness
is
a
maim
to
us
hot
a
perilous
gash
a
very
limb
lopp
off
and
yet
in
faith
it
is
not
his
present
want
seems
more
than
we
shall
find
it
were
it
good
to
set
the
exact
wealth
of
all
our
states
all
at
one
cast
to
set
so
rich
a
man
on
the
nice
hazard
of
one
doubtful
hour
it
were
not
good
for
therein
should
we
read
the
very
bottom
and
the
soul
of
hope
the
very
list
the
very
utmost
bound
of
all
our
fortunes
doug
faith
and
so
we
should
where
now
remains
a
sweet
reversion
we
may
boldly
spend
upon
the
hope
of
what
is
to
come
in
a
comfort
of
retirement
lives
in
this
hot
a
rendezvous
a
home
to
fly
unto
if
that
the
devil
and
mischance
look
big
upon
the
maidenhead
of
our
affairs
wor
but
yet
i
would
your
father
had
been
here
the
quality
and
hair
of
our
attempt
brooks
no
division
it
will
be
thought
by
some
that
know
not
why
he
is
away
that
wisdom
loyalty
and
mere
dislike
of
our
proceedings
kept
the
earl
from
hence
and
think
how
such
an
apprehension
may
turn
the
tide
of
fearful
faction
and
breed
a
kind
of
question
in
our
cause
for
well
you
know
we
of
the
side
must
keep
aloof
from
strict
arbitrement
and
stop
all
every
loop
from
whence
the
eye
of
reason
may
pry
in
upon
us
this
absence
of
your
father
draws
a
curtain
that
shows
the
ignorant
a
kind
of
fear
before
not
dreamt
of
hot
you
strain
too
far
i
rather
of
his
absence
make
this
use
it
lends
a
lustre
and
more
great
opinion
a
larger
dare
to
our
great
enterprise
than
if
the
earl
were
here
for
men
must
think
if
we
without
his
help
can
make
a
head
to
push
against
a
kingdom
with
his
help
we
shall
it
down
yet
all
goes
well
yet
all
our
joints
are
whole

defend

still
i
should
stand
so
so

anointed
majesty

to
my
charge
the
king
hath
sent
to
know
the
nature
of
your
griefs
and
whereupon
you
conjure
from
the
breast
of
civil
peace
such
bold
hostility
teaching
his
duteous
land
audacious
cruelty
if
that
the
king
have
any
way
your
good
deserts

which
he
confesseth
to
be
manifold
he
bids
you
name
your
griefs
and
with
all
speed
you
shall
have
your
desires
with
interest
and
pardon
absolute
for
yourself
and
these
herein
misled
by
your
suggestion
hot
the
king
is
kind
and
well
we
know
the
king
knows
at
what
time
to
promise
when
to
pay
my
father
and
my
uncle
and
myself
did
give
him
that
same
royalty
he
wears
and
when
he
was
not
strong
sick
in
the
world
regard
wretched
and
low
a
poor
unminded
outlaw
sneaking
home
my
father
gave
him
welcome
to
the
shore
and
when
he
heard
him
swear
and
vow
to
god
he
came
but
to
be
duke
of
lancaster
to
sue
his
livery
and
beg
his
peace
with
tears
of
innocency
and
terms
of
zeal
my
father
in
kind
heart
and
pity
mov
swore
him
assistance
and
performed
it
too
now
when
the
lords
and
barons
of
the
realm
perceiv
northumberland
did
lean
to
him
the
more
and
less
came
in
with
cap
and
knee

him

him
on

in

gifts
before
him
proffer
him
their
oaths
give
him
their
heirs
as
pages
followed
him
even
at
the
heels
in
golden
multitudes
he
presently
as
greatness
knows
itself
steps
me
a
little
higher
than
his
vow
made
to
my
father
while
his
blood
was
poor
upon
the
naked
shore
at
ravenspurgh
and
now
forsooth
takes
on
him
to
reform
some
certain
edicts
and
some
strait
decrees
that
lie
too
heavy
on
the
commonwealth
cries
out
upon
abuses
seems
to
weep
over
his
country
wrongs
and
by
this
face
this
seeming
brow
of
justice
did
he
win
the
hearts
of
all
that
he
did
angle
for
proceeded
cut
me
off
the
heads
of
all
the
favourites
that
the
absent
king
in
deputation
left
behind
him
here
when
he
was
personal
in
the
irish
war
but
tut
i
came
not
to
hear
this
hot
then
to
the
point
in
short
time
after
lie
depos
the
king
soon
after
that
depriv
him
of
his
life
and
in
the
neck
of
that
task
the
whole
state
to
make
that
worse
his
kinsman
march
who
is
if
every
owner
were
well
placid
indeed
his
king
to
be
engag
in
wales
there
without
ransom
to
lie
forfeited
disgrac
me
in
my
happy
victories
sought
to
entrap
me
by
intelligence
rated
mine
uncle
from
the
council
board
in
rage
dismiss
my
father
from
the
court
broke
an
oath
on
oath
committed
wrong
on
wrong
and
in
conclusion
drove
us
to
seek
out
this
head
of
safety
and
withal
to
pry
into
his
title
the
which
we
find
too
indirect
for
long
continuance
blunt
shall
i
return
this
answer
to
the
king
hot
not
so
sir
walter
we
withdraw
awhile
go
to
the
king
and
let
there
be
some
surety
for
a
safe
return
again
and
in
the
morning
early
shall
mine
uncle
bring
him
our
purposes
and
so

my
cousin
scroop
and
all
the
rest
to
whom
they
are
directed
if
you
knew
how
much
they
do
import
you
would
make
haste
sir
my
good
lord
i
guess
their
tenour
arch
like
enough
you
do
good
sir
michael
is
a
day
wherein
the
fortune
of
ten
thousand
men
must
bide
the
touch
for
sir
at
shrewsbury
as
i
am
truly
given
to
understand
the
king
with
mighty
and
power
meets
with
lord
harry
and
i
fear
sir
michael
what
with
the
sickness
of
northumberland
whose
power
was
in
the
first
proportion
and
what
with
owen
glendower
absence
thence
who
with
them
was
a
rated
sinew
too
and
comes
not
in
overrul
by
i
fear
the
power
of
percy
is
too
weak
to
wage
an
instant
trial
with
the
king
sir
why
my
good
lord
you
need
not
fear
there
is
douglas
and
lord
mortimer
arch
no
mortimer
is
not
there
sir
but
there
is
mordake
vernon
lord
harry
percy
and
there
is
my
lord
of
worcester
and
a
head
of
gallant
warriors
noble
gentlemen
arch
and
so
there
is
but
yet
the
king
hath
drawn
the
special
head
of
all
the
land
the
prince
of
wales
lord
john
of
lancaster
the
noble
westmoreland

warlike
blunt

and
dear
men
of
estimation
and
command
in
arms
sir
doubt
not
my
lord
they
shall
be
well
oppos
arch
i
hope
no
less
yet
needful
is
to
fear
and
to
prevent
the
worst
sir
michael
speed
for
if
lord
percy
thrive
not
ere
the
king
dismiss
his
power
he
means
to
visit
us
for
he
hath
heard
of
our
confederacy
and
is
but
wisdom
to
make
strong
against
him
therefore
make
haste
i
must
go
write
again
to
other
friends

bloodily
the

hill
the
day
looks
pale
at
his
prince
the
southern
wind
doth
play
the
trumpet
to
his
purposes
and
by
his
hollow
whistling
in
the
leaves
foretells
a
tempest
and
a

to
those
that

now
my
lord

not

us
doff
our

robes

my
lord

you
again
unknit
this
churlish
knot
of
war
and
move
in
that
obedient
orb
again
where
you
did
give
a
fair
and
natural
light
and
be
no
more
an
exhal

a
prodigy
of
fear
and
a
portent
of
broached
mischief
to
the
unborn
times
wor
hear
me
my
liege
for
mine
own
part
i
could
be
well
content
to
entertain
the
of
my
life
with
quiet
hours
for
i
do
protest
i
have
not
sought
the
day
of
this
dislike
king
you
have
not
sought
it
how
comes
it
then
fal
rebellion
lay
in
his
way
and
he
found
it
prince
peace
chewet
peace
wor
it
pleas
your
majesty
to
turn
your
looks
of
favour
from
myself
and
all
our
house
and
yet
i
must
remember
you
my
lord
we
were
the
first
and
dearest
of
your
friends
for
you
my
staff
of
office
did
i
break
in
richard
time
and
posted
day
and
night
to
meet
you
on
the
way
and
kiss
your
hand
when
yet
you
were
in
place
and
in
account
nothing
so
strong
and
fortunate
as
i
it
was
myself
my
brother
and
his
son
that
brought
you
home
and
boldly
did
outdare
the
dangers
of
the
time
you
swore
to
us
and
you
did
swear
that
oath
at
doncaster
that
you
did
nothing
purpose
the
state
nor
claim
no
further
than
your
right
the
seat
of
gaunt
dukedom
of
lancaster
to
this
we
swore
our
aid
but
in
short
space
it
it
rain
down
fortune
on
your
head
and
such
a
flood
of
greatness
fell
on
what
with
our
help
what
with
the
absent
king
what
with
the
injuries
of
a
wanton
time
the
seeming
sufferances
that
you
had
borne
and
the
contrarious
winds
that
held
the
king
so
long
in
his
unlucky
irish
wars
that
all
in
england
did
repute
him
and
from
this
swarm
of
fair
advantages
you
took
occasion
to
be
quickly
to
gripe
the
general
sway
into
your
hand
forgot
your
oath
to
us
at
doncaster
and
being
fed
by
us
you
us
us
so
as
that
ungentle
gull
the
cuckoo
bird
useth
the
did
oppress
our
nest
grew
by
our
feeding
to
so
great
a
bulk
that
even
our
love
thirst
not
come
near
your
sight
for
fear
of
swallowing
but
with
nimble
wing
we
were
enforc
for
safety
sake
to
fly
out
of
your
sight
and
raise
this
present
head
whereby
we
stand
opposed
by
such
means
as
you
yourself
have
forg
against
yourself
by
unkind
usage
dangerous
countenance
and
violation
of
all
faith
and
troth
sworn
to
tis
in
your
younger
enterprise
king
these
things
indeed
you
have
articulate
proclaim
at
market
crosses
read
in
churches
to
face
the
garment
of
rebellion
with
some
fine
colour
that
may
please
the
eye
of
fickle
changelings
and
poor
discontents
which
gape
and
rub
the
elbow
at
the
news
of
hurlyburly
innovation
and
never
yet

nor
moody
beggars
starving
for
a
time
of
havoc
and
confusion
prince
in
both

dearly

join
with
all
the
world
in

by
my
hopes
this
present
enterprise
set
off
his
head
i
do
not
think
a
braver
gentleman
more
or
more
more
daring
or
more
bold
is
now
alive
to
grace
this
latter
age
with
noble
deeds
for
my
part
i
may
speak
it
to
my
shame
i
have
a
truant
been
to
chivalry
and
so
i
hear
he
doth
account
me
too
yet
this
before
my
father
i
am
content
that
he
shall
take
the
odds
of
his
great
name
and
estimation
and
will
to
save
the
blood
on
either
side
try
fortune
with
him
in
a
single
fight
king
and
prince
of
wales
so
dare
we
venture
thee
albeit
considerations
infinite
do
make
against
it
no
good
worcester
no
we
love
our
people
well
even
those
we
love
that
are
misled
upon
your
cousin
part
and
will
they
take
the
offer
of
our
grace
both
he
and
they
and
you
yea
every
man
shall
be
my
friend
again
and
i
be
his
so
tell
your
cousin
and
bring
me
word
what
he
will
do
but
if
he
will
not
yield
rebuke
and
dread
correction
wait
on
us
and
they
shall
do
their
office
so
be
gone
we
will
not
now
be
troubled
with
reply
we
offer
fair
take
it
advisedly
exit
worcester
with
vernon
prince
it
will
not
be
accepted
on
my
life
the
douglas
and
the
hotspur
both
together
are
confident
against
the
world
in
arms
king
hence
therefore
every
leader
to
his
charge
for
on
their
answer
will
we
set
on
them
and
god
befriend
us
as
our
cause
is
just
exeunt
manent
prince
falstaff
fal
hal
if
thou
see

so
is
a
point
of

prince
nothing
but
a
colossus
can
do
thee
that
friendship
say
thy
prayers

farewell
fal
i

prince
why
thou
owest

a
death
exit
fal
is
not
due
yet
i
would
be
loath
to
pay
him
before
his
day
what
need
i
be
so
forward
with
him
that
calls
not
on
me
well
is
no
matter
honour
pricks
me
on
yea
but
how
if
honour
prick
me
off
when
i
come
on
how
then
can
honor
set
to
a
leg
no
or
an
arm
no
or
take
away
the
grief
of
a
wound
no
honour
hath
no
skill
in
surgery
then
no
what
is
honour
a
word
what
is
that
word
honour
air
a
trim
reckoning
who
hath
it
he
that
died
a

be
bear
it
no
is
insensible
then
yea
to
the
dead
but
will
it
not
live
with
the
living
no
why

therefore
none

suspect
us
still

find
a
time
to
punish
this
offence
in
other
faults
suspicion
all
our

be
stuck
full
of

my

a
stop
o
i
could
prophesy
but
that
the
earthy
and
cold
hand
of
death
lies
on
my
tongue
no
percy
thou
art
dust
and
food
dies
prince
for
worms
brave
percy
fare
thee
well
great
heart
ambition
how
much
art
thou
shrunk
when
that
this
body
did
contain
a
spirit
a
kingdom
for
it
was
too
small
a
bound
but
now
two
paces
of
the
vilest
earth
is
room
enough
this
earth
that
bears
thee
dead
bears
not
alive
so
stout
a
gentleman
if
thou
wert
sensible
of
courtesy
i
should
not
make
so
dear
a
show
of
zeal
but
let
my
favours
hide
thy
mangled
face
and
even
in
thy
behalf
i
thank
myself
for
doing
these
fair
rites
of
tenderness
adieu
and
take
thy
praise
with
thee
to
heaven
thy
ignominy
sleep
with
thee
in
the
grave
but
not
in
thy
epitaph
he
spieth
falstaff
on
the
ground
what
old
acquaintance
could
not
all
this
flesh
keep
in
a
little
life
poor
jack
farewell
i
could
have
better
spar
a
better
man
o
i
should
have
a
heavy
miss
of
thee
if
i
were
much
in
love
with
vanity
death
hath
not
struck
so
fat
a
deer
though
many
dearer
in
this
bloody
fray
embowell
will
i
see
thee
till
then
in
blood
by
noble
percy
lie
exit
falstaff
riseth
up
fal
embowell
if
thou
embowel
me
i
give
you
leave
to
powder
me
and
eat
me
too
was
time
to
counterfeit
or
that
hot
termagant
scot
had
paid
me
scot
and
lot
too
counterfeit
i
lie
i
am
no
counterfeit
to
die
is
to
be
a
counterfeit
for
he
is
but
the
counterfeit
of
a
man
who
hath
not
the
life
of
a
man
but
to
counterfeit
dying
when
a
man
thereby
liveth
is
to
be
no
counterfeit
but
the
true
and
perfect
image
of
life
indeed
the
better
part
of
valour
is
discretion
in
the
which
better
part
i
have
saved
my
life
zounds
i
am
afraid
of
this
gunpowder
percy
though
he
be
dead
how
if
he
should
counterfeit
too
and
rise
by
my
faith
i
am
afraid
he
would
prove
the
better
counterfeit
therefore
i
make
him
sure
yea
and
i
swear
i
kill
him
why
may
not
he
rise
as
well
as
i
nothing
confutes
me
but
eyes
and
nobody
sees
me
therefore
sirrah
stabs
him
with
a
new
wound
in
your
thigh

with
me
