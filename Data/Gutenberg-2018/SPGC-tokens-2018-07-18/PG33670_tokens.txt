the
translation
of
goethe
prose
maxims
now
offered
to
the
public
is
the
first
attempt
that
has
yet
been
made
to
present
the
greater
part
of
these
incomparable
sayings
in
english
in
the
complete
collection
they
are
over
a
thousand
in
number
and
not
more
perhaps
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
have
already
found
their
way
into
our
language
whether
as
contributions
to
magazines
here
and
in
america
or
in
volumes
of
miscellaneous
extract
from
goethe
writings
some
are
at
times
quoted
as
though
they
were
common
literary
property
to
say
that
they
are
important
as
a
whole
would
be
a
feeble
tribute
to
a
work
eloquent
for
itself
and
beyond
the
need
of
praise
but
so
deep
is
the
wisdom
of
these
maxims
so
wide
their
reach
so
compact
a
product
are
they
of
goethe
wonderful
genius
that
it
is
something
of
a
reproach
to
literature
to
find
the
most
of
them
left
untranslated
for
the
sixty
years
they
have
been
before
the
world
from
one
point
of
view
the
neglect
they
have
suffered
is
in
no
way
surprising
they
are
too
high
and
severe
to
be
popular
so
soon
and
when
they
meet
with
a
wide
acceptance
as
with
other
great
works
much
of
it
will
rest
upon
authority
but
even
for
the
deeper
side
of
his
writings
goethe
has
not
been
denied
a
fair
measure
of
popular
success
no
other
author
of
the
last
two
centuries
holds
so
high
a
place
or
as
an
inevitable
consequence
has
been
attacked
by
so
large
an
army
of
editors
and
commentators
and
it
might
well
be
supposed
by
now
that
no
corner
of
his
work
and
least
of
all
one
of
the
best
had
remained
almost
unnoticed
and
to
the
majority
unknown
many
of
these
maxims
were
early
translated
into
french
but
with
little
success
and
even
in
germany
it
was
only
so
late
as
the
year
that
they
appeared
in
a
separate
form
with
the
addition
of
some
sort
of
critical
comment
and
a
brief
explanation
of
their
origin
and
history
but
although
to
what
is
called
the
reading
public
these
maxims
are
as
yet
no
less
in
fact
than
in
metaphor
a
closed
book
its
pages
have
long
been
a
source
of
profit
and
delight
to
some
of
those
who
are
best
able
to
estimate
their
value
what
that
value
is
i
shall
presently
endeavour
to
explain
no
one
i
think
can
perceive
their
worth
without
also
discerning
how
nearly
they
touch
the
needs
of
our
own
day
and
how
greatly
they
may
help
us
in
facing
certain
problems
of
life
and
conduct
some
of
them
in
truth
as
old
as
the
world
itself
which
appear
to
us
now
with
peculiar
force
and
subtlety
it
was
in
this
respect
that
they
were
warmly
recommended
to
me
some
years
ago
by
my
excellent
friend
professor
harnack
the
historian
of
dogma
a
writer
with
a
fine
and
prudent
enthusiasm
for
all
ennobling
literature
it
is
to
him
that
i
owe
the
resolve
to
perform
for
the
maxims
as
far
as
i
could
the
office
of
translator
a
humble
office
but
not
as
i
have
good
reason
to
know
without
its
difficulty
or
as
i
venture
to
hope
without
its
use
of
many
of
them
the
language
is
hardly
lucid
even
to
a
german
and
i
have
gratefully
to
acknowledge
the
assistance
i
have
received
from
the
privilege
of
discussing
them
with
so
distinguished
a
man
of
letters
to
professor
huxley
i
am
also
deeply
indebted
i
owe
him
much
for
friendly
encouragement
and
still
more
for
help
of
an
altogether
invaluable
kind
for
in
its
measure
of
knowledge
and
skill
it
is
admittedly
beyond
the
power
of
any
other
living
englishman
the
maxims
deal
not
alone
with
life
and
character
where
most
of
them
are
admirable
but
also
with
certain
aspects
of
science
and
art
and
these
are
matters
in
which
i
could
exercise
no
judgment
myself
although
i
understood
that
while
many
of
the
maxims
on
science
and
art
were
attractive
they
were
not
all
of
great
merit
professor
huxley
not
only
did
me
the
honour
to
select
the
maxims
on
science
but
he
was
further
good
enough
to
assist
me
with
them
and
to
read
and
approve
the
translation
as
it
now
stands
the
weight
and
the
interest
of
his
authority
will
thus
give
additional
value
to
that
section
of
the
book
and
also
do
much
to
overcome
the
objections
that
exist
to
making
a
selection
at
all
for
a
selection
is
a
necessary
evil
it
is
an
evil
because
even
if
it
leaves
the
best
it
takes
away
something
of
a
man
work
if
it
shows
us
the
heights
he
has
reached
it
obliterates
the
steps
of
his
ascent
it
endangers
thoughts
that
may
be
important
but
imperfectly
understood
and
it
hinders
a
fair
and
complete
judgment
but
in
the
end
it
is
a
necessity
we
are
concerned
chiefly
with
the
best
and
clearest
results
and
it
is
only
the
few
who
care
to
follow
the
elaborate
details
of
effort
and
progress
often
painful
and
obscure
there
is
no
author
with
whom
for
most
readers
selection
is
so
necessary
as
it
is
with
goethe
and
in
no
other
kind
of
literature
is
it
so
amply
justified
or
so
clearly
desirable
as
where
the
aim
is
to
state
broad
truths
of
life
and
conduct
and
method
in
a
manner
admitting
of
no
mistake
or
uncertainty
when
a
writer
attempts
achievements
as
goethe
did
in
almost
every
field
of
thought
it
need
be
no
surprise
to
any
one
who
has
heard
of
human
fallibility
that
in
solid
results
he
is
not
equally
successful
everywhere
in
deciding
what
shall
be
omitted
there
is
no
difficulty
with
maxims
which
time
has
shown
to
be
wrong
or
defective
they
have
only
an
historical
interest
but
great
care
is
necessary
with
others
that
are
tentative
questionable
or
obscure
enough
to
need
the
light
of
a
commentary
sometimes
dubious
where
for
most
of
us
there
is
never
much
profit
and
always
occasion
for
stumbling
i
count
it
a
singular
piece
of
good
fortune
that
the
choice
of
the
scientific
maxims
should
be
undertaken
by
so
eminent
a
judge
of
their
practical
value
who
is
also
a
scholar
in
the
language
and
a
great
admirer
of
goethe
in
his
other
and
better
known
productions
for
if
a
writer
of
this
immense
versatility
can
not
always
hope
to
touch
the
highest
goal
it
is
well
that
all
his
efforts
should
be
weighed
in
a
later
day
by
the
best
and
friendliest
knowledge
the
maxims
on
art
were
at
first
a
matter
of
some
little
difficulty
it
is
plain
i
think
that
they
are
below
the
others
in
value
and
interest
and
in
any
collection
of
sayings
the
less
there
is
of
general
worth
the
more
delicate
becomes
the
task
of
choosing
the
best
if
i
omitted
them
all
the
selection
would
not
be
duly
representative
and
it
seemed
likely
that
some
at
least
were
worthy
of
being
preserved
if
only
to
illustrate
goethe
theories
i
therefore
sought
the
best
advice
and
here
again
i
have
to
tender
my
thanks
for
assistance
second
to
none
in
skill
and
authority
that
of
sir
frederick
leighton
kindly
given
under
circumstances
which
much
increase
my
obligation
for
it
is
my
duty
to
say
that
sir
frederick
leighton
had
no
desire
but
rather
reluctance
to
make
a
selection
from
maxims
on
art
which
he
was
often
not
prepared
to
endorse
or
to
regard
as
in
any
way
commensurate
with
goethe
genius
and
nevertheless
he
did
me
the
honour
to
point
out
a
few
which
i
might
insert
as
being
of
interest
partly
for
their
own
sake
partly
also
for
the
name
of
their
author
the
maxims
on
science
and
art
are
however
when
taken
together
hardly
a
fifth
of
this
volume
the
others
i
have
selected
on
the
simple
and
i
hope
blameless
principle
of
omitting
only
what
is
clearly
unimportant
antiquated
of
past
or
passing
interest
of
purely
personal
reference
or
of
a
nature
too
abstruse
to
stand
without
notes
of
explanation
which
i
should
be
sorry
to
place
at
the
foot
of
any
of
these
pages
i
have
also
omitted
eleven
maxims
drawn
from
hippocrates
fifteen
containing
an
appreciation
of
sterne
together
with
some
twenty
more
which
goethe
himself
translated
from
a
curious
work
wrongly
attributed
to
that
writer
it
will
be
convenient
if
i
state
that
i
have
thus
omitted
some
hundred
and
twenty
out
of
the
six
hundred
and
which
make
up
the
section
styled
in
the
original
which
i
translate
by
and
the
section
which
also
contains
the
maxims
on
now
collected
and
placed
in
a
separate
section
with
those
on
sir
frederick
leighton
chose
out
of
a
hundred
and
eighteen
on
art
and
professor
huxley
out
of
two
hundred
and
eighty
on
science
ii
having
thus
acknowledged
but
in
no
way
discharged
a
triple
debt
of
gratitude
it
will
be
next
in
order
if
i
briefly
state
the
history
of
the
work
which
now
appears
in
an
english
dress
before
attempting
to
speak
of
its
nature
and
value
the
publication
of
the
maxims
belongs
to
the
later
that
is
to
say
the
last
thirty
years
of
goethe
life
and
the
greater
number
of
them
appeared
only
in
the
last
ten
while
some
are
posthumous
it
is
impossible
to
say
with
certainty
at
what
period
he
began
the
observations
which
were
afterwards
to
come
before
the
world
in
this
shape
nor
is
the
question
of
any
real
interest
except
to
pedantic
students
of
such
matters
it
is
probable
that
like
most
writers
goethe
was
in
the
habit
of
noting
transient
thoughts
of
his
own
as
well
as
opinions
of
others
that
suggested
more
than
they
actually
conveyed
and
of
preserving
for
further
use
what
he
had
thus
in
his
own
words
written
himself
and
appropriated
from
elsewhere
and
the
maxims
grew
out
of
a
collection
of
this
character
it
was
a
habit
formed
probably
in
early
life
for
somewhere
in
the
a
work
of
eighteen
years
duration
but
begun
at
the
age
of
he
makes
wilhelm
meister
speak
of
the
value
of
it
but
there
are
reasons
for
thinking
that
most
of
the
maxims
as
they
now
stand
were
not
alone
published
but
also
composed
in
his
last
years
the
unity
of
meaning
which
stamps
them
with
a
common
aim
the
similarity
of
the
calm
dispassionate
language
in
which
they
are
written
the
didactic
tone
that
colours
them
throughout
combine
to
show
that
they
are
among
the
last
and
ripest
fruits
of
his
genius
some
were
certainly
composed
between
the
ages
of
fifty
and
sixty
more
still
between
that
and
seventy
while
there
is
evidence
both
internal
and
external
proving
that
many
and
perhaps
most
of
them
were
his
final
reflections
on
life
and
the
world
this
it
is
that
adds
so
much
to
their
interest
for
as
he
himself
finely
says
in
one
of
the
last
of
them
in
a
tranquil
mind
thoughts
rise
up
at
the
close
of
life
hitherto
unthinkable
like
blessed
inward
voices
alighting
in
glory
on
the
summits
of
the
past
but
whenever
all
or
any
of
them
were
written
and
whatever
revision
they
may
have
undergone
none
were
published
until
when
goethe
was
sixty
years
of
age
it
was
then
that
he
brought
out
a
few
of
the
maxims
on
life
and
character
were
there
inserted
as
forming
two
extracts
from
a
journal
often
quoted
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
story
about
this
time
writes
goethe
as
he
introduces
the
first
of
these
extracts
outward
events
are
seldomer
noted
in
ottilie
diary
whilst
maxims
and
sentences
on
life
in
general
and
drawn
from
it
become
more
frequent
but
he
adds
as
most
of
them
can
hardly
be
due
to
her
own
reflections
it
is
likely
that
some
one
had
given
her
a
book
or
paper
from
which
she
wrote
out
anything
that
pleased
her
a
few
more
maxims
appeared
eight
years
later
in
and
a
magazine
founded
by
goethe
in
and
devoted
to
the
discussion
of
artistic
questions
and
a
larger
number
first
saw
the
light
in
the
same
publication
at
various
dates
until
its
extinction
in
some
of
the
observations
on
science
had
meanwhile
been
incorporated
with
two
treatises
on
branches
of
that
subject
eckermann
tells
a
curious
story
of
the
way
in
which
goethe
then
continued
the
publication
of
the
maxims
meisters
had
appeared
in
its
first
form
in
afterwards
in
goethe
decided
to
remodel
and
lengthen
it
and
to
make
two
volumes
out
of
what
had
originally
been
only
one
his
secretary
was
employed
to
copy
it
out
in
its
revised
form
he
wrote
in
a
large
hand
which
gave
the
impression
that
the
story
might
well
fill
even
three
volumes
and
directions
to
this
effect
were
sent
to
the
publisher
but
it
was
soon
discovered
that
the
last
two
volumes
would
be
very
thin
and
the
publisher
asked
for
more
manuscript
goethe
in
some
perplexity
sent
for
eckermann
and
producing
two
large
bundles
of
unpublished
papers
containing
as
he
said
some
very
important
things
opinions
on
life
literature
science
and
art
all
mingled
together
proposed
to
him
to
lengthen
out
the
volumes
by
inserting
selections
from
them
you
might
he
suggested
fill
the
gaps
in
the
by
making
up
some
six
or
eight
sheets
from
these
detached
pieces
strictly
speaking
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
story
but
we
may
justify
the
proceeding
by
the
fact
that
i
mention
an
archive
in
makarie
house
in
which
such
miscellanies
are
preserved
in
this
way
we
shall
not
only
get
over
our
difficulty
but
find
a
good
vehicle
for
giving
much
interesting
matter
to
the
world
eckermann
approved
the
plan
and
divided
his
selection
into
two
parts
and
when
the
new
edition
of
the
appeared
one
of
them
was
styled
makariens
and
the
other
im
sinne
der
wanderer
kunst
ethisches
the
remainder
of
the
unpublished
maxims
appeared
posthumously
either
in
the
in
or
in
the
quarto
edition
of
instructions
had
been
given
to
eckermann
to
collect
all
the
maxims
arrange
them
under
different
heads
and
include
them
in
appropriate
volumes
but
he
resolved
to
deviate
from
his
instructions
to
the
extent
of
publishing
them
all
together
and
the
alteration
is
certainly
an
advantage
a
slight
was
made
by
von
loeper
who
was
deterred
from
undertaking
a
more
radical
one
although
he
thought
it
might
be
done
with
profit
by
the
consideration
that
when
a
literary
work
of
undesigned
and
fortuitous
form
has
lived
any
number
of
years
in
a
certain
shape
that
fact
alone
is
a
weighty
argument
against
any
change
in
it
in
a
translation
perhaps
where
the
work
is
presented
anew
and
to
a
fresh
public
the
change
might
be
allowable
and
i
should
have
undertaken
it
had
there
not
been
a
more
serious
reason
which
von
loeper
also
urges
against
any
attempt
at
systematic
the
further
fact
namely
that
many
of
the
maxims
have
a
mixed
character
placing
them
above
our
distinctions
of
scientific
and
ethical
and
making
it
difficult
to
decide
under
which
heading
they
ought
to
fall
i
have
therefore
generally
followed
the
traditional
order
with
this
exception
that
for
obvious
reasons
the
maxims
dealing
with
literature
are
here
placed
together
and
as
only
a
few
of
those
on
art
appear
in
these
pages
i
have
included
them
in
the
same
section
in
one
or
two
cases
i
have
united
closely
connected
maxims
which
are
separated
in
the
original
and
for
the
sake
of
a
short
title
i
have
slightly
narrowed
the
meaning
of
the
word
which
applies
to
any
kind
of
shrewd
saying
whether
it
be
strictly
a
maxim
or
an
aphorism
some
little
liberties
of
this
kind
may
i
think
be
taken
by
a
translator
anxious
to
put
the
work
before
his
own
public
in
an
orderly
and
convenient
form
the
last
section
in
this
book
requires
a
word
of
explanation
it
is
a
little
essay
on
which
is
to
be
found
with
a
variety
of
other
fragments
in
the
last
volume
of
goethe
collected
works
too
short
to
stand
by
itself
if
it
appears
at
all
it
must
be
in
company
with
kindred
matter
and
as
a
series
of
aphorisms
presenting
a
poetic
view
of
nature
unsurpassed
in
its
union
of
beauty
and
insight
it
is
no
inappropriate
appendage
to
the
maxims
on
science
it
is
little
known
and
it
deserves
to
be
widely
known
i
venture
to
think
that
even
in
germany
the
ordinary
reader
is
unaware
of
its
existence
for
us
in
england
it
was
so
to
speak
discovered
by
professor
huxley
who
many
years
ago
gave
a
translation
of
it
as
a
proem
to
a
scientific
periodical
perhaps
that
proem
may
yet
be
recovered
as
good
salvage
from
the
waters
of
oblivion
which
sooner
or
later
overwhelm
all
magazines
meanwhile
i
put
forward
this
version
for
sixty
years
this
essay
has
stood
unquestioned
in
goethe
works
but
doubt
has
recently
been
cast
on
its
authorship
the
account
hitherto
given
rests
upon
the
excellent
ground
of
goethe
own
declaration
the
essay
it
appears
was
written
about
the
year
and
offered
to
the
duchess
amalia
some
time
after
her
death
it
was
found
amongst
her
papers
and
sent
to
goethe
in
may
when
as
he
wrote
to
his
friend
the
chancellor
von
müller
he
could
not
remember
having
composed
it
although
he
recognised
the
writing
as
that
of
a
person
of
whose
services
he
used
to
avail
himself
some
forty
years
previously
that
at
so
great
a
distance
of
time
a
prolific
author
could
not
recall
the
composition
of
so
short
a
piece
is
not
indeed
improbable
but
goethe
proceeded
to
say
that
it
agreed
very
well
with
the
pantheistic
ideas
which
occupied
him
at
the
age
of
thirty
and
that
his
insight
then
might
be
called
a
comparative
which
was
thus
forced
to
express
its
strife
towards
an
as
yet
unattained
superlative
notwithstanding
this
declaration
the
essay
is
now
claimed
as
the
production
of
a
certain
swiss
friend
of
goethe
by
name
tobler
on
external
evidence
which
need
not
be
examined
here
and
on
the
internal
evidence
afforded
by
the
style
which
is
certainly
more
pointed
and
antithetic
than
is
usual
with
goethe
but
a
master
of
language
who
attempted
every
kind
of
composition
may
well
have
attempted
this
and
even
those
who
credit
an
otherwise
unknown
person
with
the
actual
writing
of
the
essay
candidly
admit
that
it
is
based
upon
conversations
with
goethe
it
is
so
clearly
inspired
with
his
genius
that
he
can
hardly
be
forced
to
yield
the
credit
of
it
to
another
iii
it
is
no
wish
or
business
of
mine
to
introduce
these
maxims
by
adding
one
more
to
the
innumerable
essays
some
of
them
admirable
which
have
been
written
on
goethe
i
have
found
the
translation
of
one
of
his
works
a
harder
and
certainly
a
more
profitable
task
than
a
general
discourse
on
them
all
and
i
profoundly
believe
that
rather
than
read
what
has
been
written
on
goethe
it
is
very
much
better
to
read
goethe
himself
it
is
in
this
belief
that
i
hope
the
present
translation
may
help
in
a
small
way
to
increase
the
direct
knowledge
of
him
in
this
country
but
there
are
some
remarks
which
i
may
be
allowed
to
make
on
the
nature
and
use
of
maxims
and
the
peculiar
value
of
those
of
goethe
so
far
at
least
as
they
deal
with
life
and
character
and
with
literature
if
professor
huxley
could
be
induced
to
publish
the
comments
which
he
made
to
me
as
i
read
him
the
scientific
maxims
besides
being
the
best
of
introductions
to
that
section
of
the
book
they
would
form
a
keen
and
clear
review
of
goethe
scientific
achievements
and
an
emphatic
testimony
to
his
wonderful
anticipations
of
later
theories
between
a
maxim
an
aphorism
and
an
apophthegm
and
in
a
more
obvious
degree
between
these
and
an
adage
and
a
proverb
the
etymologist
and
the
lexicographer
may
easily
find
a
distinction
but
they
are
one
and
all
fragments
of
the
wisdom
of
life
treasured
up
in
short
pithy
sentences
that
state
or
define
some
general
truth
of
experience
and
perhaps
with
an
adage
and
a
maxim
enjoin
its
practice
as
a
matter
of
conduct
in
the
literature
of
every
age
there
have
been
writers
who
instead
of
following
a
less
severe
method
thus
briefly
record
the
lessons
taught
them
by
a
wide
view
of
the
doings
of
men
from
the
dim
beginnings
of
ptah
hotep
the
egyptian
to
the
authors
of
the
proverbs
of
solomon
and
the
book
of
wisdom
from
theognis
and
plutarch
downwards
to
our
own
time
they
give
us
the
shrewdest
of
their
thoughts
detached
from
the
facts
which
gave
them
birth
but
the
professed
writers
of
maxims
are
not
the
only
or
always
the
best
authors
of
them
there
is
no
great
writer
who
is
not
rich
in
wise
sentences
where
we
have
the
advantage
of
seeing
for
ourselves
the
train
of
thought
that
induced
and
the
occasion
that
called
them
forth
terse
and
pregnant
sayings
are
scattered
innumerably
through
the
pages
of
the
finest
poets
the
great
orators
philosophers
and
historians
wherever
they
touch
the
highest
level
of
truth
and
insight
be
it
in
the
lofty
interpretation
of
life
the
defence
of
action
or
policy
the
analysis
of
character
and
conduct
or
the
record
of
progress
and
then
it
is
that
large
ideas
and
wide
observations
take
on
imperceptibly
the
nature
of
maxim
or
aphorism
illumining
like
points
of
light
whole
fields
of
thought
and
experience
and
the
test
of
their
value
is
that
they
lose
little
or
nothing
by
being
deprived
of
their
particular
context
and
presented
as
truths
of
general
import
a
collection
of
proverbs
shrewd
sayings
and
pointed
expressions
taken
from
the
whole
range
of
greek
and
latin
literature
was
made
by
the
industry
of
erasmus
in
his
great
folio
of
and
perhaps
some
future
student
as
diligent
as
he
may
gather
up
the
aphoristic
wisdom
in
the
writings
of
modern
times
goethe
himself
has
in
all
his
great
works
a
wealth
of
aphorism
unsurpassed
by
any
other
writer
whatever
even
though
it
be
montaigne
or
bacon
or
shakespeare
and
sayings
of
his
not
to
be
found
in
this
collection
are
some
of
the
best
that
he
uttered
the
besetting
sin
of
the
is
to
exaggerate
one
side
of
a
matter
by
neglecting
another
to
secure
point
and
emphasis
of
style
by
limiting
the
range
of
thought
and
hence
it
is
that
most
maxims
present
but
a
portion
of
truth
and
can
not
be
received
unqualified
they
must
often
be
brought
back
to
the
test
of
life
itself
and
confronted
and
compared
with
other
sides
of
the
experience
they
profess
to
embody
and
when
a
maxim
stands
this
trial
and
proves
its
worth
it
is
not
every
one
to
whom
it
is
of
value
to
some
it
may
be
a
positive
evil
it
makes
the
strongest
appeal
to
those
who
never
see
more
than
one
aspect
of
anything
hardening
their
hearts
and
blunting
their
minds
and
even
to
those
who
could
make
a
good
use
of
it
there
are
times
when
it
may
mislead
and
be
dangerous
maxims
in
their
application
seem
to
need
something
of
the
physician
art
they
must
be
handled
with
care
and
applied
with
discretion
like
powerful
drugs
they
may
act
with
beneficent
effect
on
a
hardy
constitution
they
may
brace
it
to
effort
or
calm
the
fever
of
a
misguided
activity
but
great
is
the
mischief
they
work
where
the
mind
is
weak
or
disorganised
as
a
medicine
may
save
a
man
at
one
time
that
would
kill
him
at
another
so
the
wise
counsel
of
may
easily
become
the
poisonous
suggestion
of
with
writers
who
depend
for
effect
on
mere
qualities
of
style
and
ignore
the
weightier
matters
of
depth
and
truth
of
observation
goethe
has
nothing
in
common
nor
with
those
who
vainly
imagine
that
insight
is
a
kind
of
art
with
a
method
that
may
be
learned
and
applied
by
constant
practice
a
man
of
literary
talent
may
it
is
true
attain
a
fair
mastery
of
language
terse
and
attractive
and
then
set
himself
if
he
will
to
the
deliberate
creation
of
aphoristic
wisdom
or
a
philosophy
of
proverbs
mistaking
the
dexterous
handling
of
a
commonplace
for
the
true
process
of
discovery
the
popular
literature
of
the
last
generation
supplies
a
terrible
instance
of
the
length
to
which
the
manufacture
of
maxims
can
thus
be
carried
for
a
time
with
immense
success
and
we
have
seen
how
a
few
years
suffice
to
carry
them
and
their
author
to
obscurity
how
different
is
the
true
process
the
maxim
that
increases
knowledge
and
enriches
literature
is
of
slow
and
rare
appearance
it
springs
from
a
fine
faculty
of
observation
which
is
in
no
arbitrament
and
only
less
rare
than
the
gift
of
utterance
which
adds
charm
to
a
thought
that
itself
strikes
home
with
the
power
of
impregnable
truth
no
amount
or
intensity
of
effort
will
alone
produce
it
but
to
the
mind
of
genius
it
comes
like
a
sudden
revelation
flashing
its
light
on
a
long
course
of
patient
attention
what
we
call
says
goethe
is
the
serious
exercise
and
activity
of
an
original
feeling
for
truth
it
is
a
synthesis
of
world
and
mind
giving
the
most
blessed
assurance
of
the
eternal
harmony
of
things
it
is
then
depth
and
truth
and
sanity
of
observation
which
chiefly
mark
these
sayings
of
goethe
it
is
no
concern
of
his
to
dazzle
the
mind
by
the
brilliance
of
his
wit
nor
does
he
labour
to
say
things
because
they
are
striking
but
only
because
they
are
true
he
is
always
in
contact
with
realities
always
aiming
at
truth
and
he
takes
a
kindly
and
a
generous
view
of
the
world
he
has
none
of
the
despair
that
depresses
none
of
the
malice
that
destroys
there
are
writers
who
profess
to
honour
a
lofty
ideal
by
a
cynical
disparagement
of
everything
that
falls
short
of
it
who
unveil
the
selfish
recesses
of
the
heart
as
a
mistaken
stimulus
to
its
virtues
who
pay
their
tribute
to
great
work
by
belittling
human
endeavour
goethe
shows
us
a
more
excellent
way
touched
with
a
profound
feeling
of
the
worth
of
life
the
wisdom
of
order
the
nobility
of
effort
he
gives
us
an
ideal
to
pursue
and
shows
us
the
means
of
pursuing
it
out
of
the
fulness
of
a
large
experience
unique
in
the
history
of
literature
he
unfolds
the
scheme
of
a
practicable
perfection
and
enforces
the
lessons
he
has
learned
from
the
steady
passionless
and
undaunted
observation
of
human
affairs
to
goethe
these
sayings
were
merely
or
it
is
his
literary
executors
and
his
editors
who
called
them
by
more
ambitious
titles
so
as
to
challenge
a
comparison
with
certain
other
famous
books
of
wise
thought
they
are
the
reflections
of
a
long
life
rich
in
all
the
intellectual
treasures
of
the
world
in
its
versatility
amazing
in
its
insight
fathomless
a
life
that
in
his
own
words
approached
the
infinite
by
following
the
finite
on
every
side
such
a
man
need
only
speak
to
utter
something
important
and
we
on
our
part
need
only
remember
how
wide
was
the
range
of
his
knowledge
how
full
and
complete
his
existence
to
set
the
utmost
value
on
his
reflections
at
the
end
of
it
but
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
pinch
of
poverty
and
was
spared
the
horrors
of
disease
that
he
suffered
no
great
misfortune
and
basked
in
the
bright
side
of
the
world
free
from
the
ills
that
come
to
most
men
there
was
no
page
of
the
book
of
life
that
was
not
thrown
open
to
him
the
things
of
the
mind
the
things
of
art
the
things
of
nature
in
their
theory
and
in
their
practice
he
had
worked
at
them
all
regarding
them
as
so
many
varied
manifestations
of
an
eternal
idea
in
itself
inscrutable
and
here
unattainable
there
was
no
kind
of
literature
with
which
he
was
unfamiliar
whether
it
was
ancient
or
modern
of
the
east
or
of
the
west
and
the
great
spiritual
influences
of
the
world
hebraism
hellenism
christianity
mediævalism
at
one
or
another
time
in
his
life
he
was
in
touch
with
them
all
and
found
his
account
in
them
all
in
matters
of
learning
he
was
occupied
with
nothing
but
what
was
actual
and
concrete
it
was
only
to
abstract
studies
to
logic
metaphysics
mathematics
that
he
was
indifferent
in
his
own
phrase
he
never
thought
about
thinking
there
was
hardly
any
branch
of
the
natural
science
of
his
day
that
he
did
not
cultivate
that
he
did
not
himself
practise
geology
mineralogy
botany
zoology
anatomy
meteorology
optics
and
he
made
some
remarkable
discoveries
and
the
strangest
prophecies
to
art
he
gave
a
devotion
while
still
a
youth
he
wrote
an
important
essay
on
gothic
architecture
he
engraved
drew
painted
and
for
a
time
took
up
sculpture
in
all
the
higher
forms
of
art
with
the
single
exception
of
music
he
had
so
much
practical
interest
that
he
often
doubted
whether
in
following
literature
he
had
not
mistaken
or
at
least
unduly
narrowed
the
sphere
of
his
activity
he
was
little
abroad
but
no
one
ever
profited
more
by
his
travels
than
goethe
twice
he
went
to
italy
and
what
a
change
of
mind
was
produced
by
that
change
of
sky
rome
was
to
him
a
new
birth
a
new
conception
of
life
and
besides
literature
science
and
art
he
busied
himself
with
administration
with
the
duties
of
the
court
with
the
practical
details
of
the
theatre
but
out
of
them
all
he
learned
something
himself
and
taught
something
to
others
he
lived
the
fullest
life
granted
to
man
he
had
a
youth
of
the
wildest
enthusiasm
and
romance
a
prime
of
a
classic
austerity
of
a
calm
earnestness
a
majestic
age
of
the
ripest
wisdom
when
there
came
to
him
as
it
were
a
second
youth
with
something
of
the
fire
of
the
old
romantic
feeling
lighted
up
in
him
anew
and
out
of
all
these
prodigious
efforts
in
so
many
directions
he
passed
unharmed
and
never
lost
himself
he
steadily
pursued
his
own
task
and
refused
to
be
drawn
aside
he
stood
aloof
from
the
controversies
of
his
time
the
battles
of
belief
philosophical
systems
french
revolutions
wars
of
liberation
struggles
of
democracy
and
nationality
these
things
moved
him
little
or
not
at
all
but
he
is
not
on
that
account
to
be
held
as
some
foolish
critics
have
held
him
indifferent
selfish
or
less
serious
or
less
complete
a
man
than
his
fellows
he
did
the
best
in
any
one
power
he
resolutely
kept
to
his
own
business
and
neither
heating
nor
resting
worked
at
his
own
high
aims
in
the
struggle
not
merely
to
learn
and
to
know
but
to
act
and
to
do
he
felt
profoundly
that
the
best
anyone
can
achieve
for
himself
is
often
the
best
he
can
achieve
for
others
the
whole
moral
of
is
that
a
first
and
greatest
duty
whether
to
others
or
to
himself
is
to
see
that
his
business
in
life
is
a
worthy
one
and
suited
to
his
capacities
if
he
discovers
his
vocation
and
pursues
it
steadily
he
will
make
his
outer
life
of
the
greatest
use
and
service
to
the
world
and
at
the
same
time
produce
the
utmost
harmony
within
that
was
what
goethe
tried
to
do
in
his
own
person
and
he
laboured
at
his
task
with
a
perseverance
a
real
unselfishness
and
a
determination
entirely
admirable
it
is
almost
the
last
fruit
of
this
life
of
concentrated
activity
the
final
outcome
of
this
indomitable
character
that
is
here
put
before
us
and
we
shall
find
that
to
the
complex
phenomena
of
the
world
goethe
applied
no
other
measure
but
reason
and
the
nature
and
needs
of
man
with
a
full
consciousness
of
the
mysteries
that
surround
our
existence
he
never
made
the
futile
endeavour
to
pass
beyond
the
bounds
of
present
knowledge
and
experience
or
to
resolve
contradictions
by
manipulating
the
facts
in
these
detached
reflections
he
does
indeed
propound
a
theory
and
sketch
out
a
system
of
conduct
but
they
can
not
like
the
of
pascal
for
instance
be
brought
under
a
single
and
definite
point
of
view
they
are
a
mirror
of
life
itself
and
the
inner
and
outer
facts
of
life
in
all
their
diversity
the
unity
they
possess
is
the
unity
that
is
stamped
upon
them
by
the
personality
of
their
author
always
and
unweariedly
striving
to
make
his
life
systematic
distinct
and
fruitful
and
to
judge
them
as
a
whole
a
man
must
be
able
to
fathom
so
great
a
genius
but
to
every
one
in
every
walk
of
life
goethe
has
a
word
of
wise
counsel
as
though
he
understood
every
form
of
existence
and
could
enter
into
its
needs
in
a
fine
passage
in
the
he
likens
the
thought
that
thus
in
wondrous
fashion
takes
a
thousand
particular
shapes
to
a
mass
of
quicksilver
which
as
it
falls
separates
into
innumerable
globules
spreading
out
on
all
sides
and
while
these
sayings
may
present
thoughts
in
seeming
contradiction
one
with
another
as
the
moment
that
called
them
forth
presented
this
or
that
side
of
experience
their
inmost
nature
is
a
common
tendency
to
realise
a
great
ideal
of
life
it
is
little
they
owe
to
the
form
in
which
they
are
cast
they
are
not
the
elements
of
an
artistic
whole
which
must
be
seized
before
we
can
understand
the
full
meaning
of
its
parts
they
are
a
miscellaneous
record
of
the
shrewdest
observation
and
to
read
them
as
they
should
be
read
a
few
at
a
time
is
like
the
opportunity
of
repeated
converse
with
a
man
of
extraordinary
gifts
great
insight
and
the
widest
culture
who
touches
profoundly
and
suggestively
now
on
this
now
on
that
aspect
of
life
and
the
world
and
the
progress
of
knowledge
it
is
the
fruit
of
his
own
experience
that
goethe
gives
us
and
we
shall
do
well
to
think
of
it
as
he
himself
thought
of
another
book
and
to
bear
in
mind
that
every
word
which
we
take
in
a
general
sense
and
apply
to
ourselves
had
under
certain
circumstances
of
time
and
place
a
peculiar
special
and
directly
individual
reference
goethe
is
no
exception
to
the
rest
of
mankind
in
not
being
equally
wise
at
all
times
and
in
the
maxims
there
are
degrees
of
value
they
do
not
all
shine
with
the
like
brilliance
some
of
them
are
valuable
only
for
what
they
suggest
of
some
again
it
is
easy
to
see
that
they
appear
as
matters
of
speculation
rather
than
as
certainties
they
raise
difficulties
ask
for
criticism
if
possible
correction
or
it
may
be
they
call
attention
to
the
contrary
view
and
invite
a
harmony
of
opposites
some
of
them
make
a
great
demand
upon
our
ability
to
understand
a
proverb
and
the
interpretation
the
words
of
the
wise
and
their
dark
sayings
their
value
sometimes
depends
on
the
way
they
are
viewed
the
culture
brought
to
their
understanding
the
temper
in
which
they
are
approached
we
look
at
them
and
at
first
admire
we
change
our
point
of
view
and
find
something
to
criticise
and
dispute
the
obscurity
of
maxims
as
goethe
reminds
us
is
only
relative
not
everything
can
be
explained
to
the
reader
which
was
present
to
the
mind
of
the
writer
some
of
them
seem
at
first
to
be
of
little
interest
on
one
side
they
may
even
repel
but
from
another
they
attract
again
and
win
perhaps
a
partial
approval
they
seem
to
move
as
we
change
our
position
and
to
be
without
fixed
or
certain
character
but
some
again
are
so
clear
and
unmistakable
so
immeasurably
above
criticism
or
objection
that
like
the
furthest
of
the
stars
they
have
no
parallax
whatever
position
we
take
their
light
is
steadfast
let
no
one
suppose
that
in
the
main
goethe
reflections
on
life
had
never
been
made
before
that
it
was
not
so
no
one
knew
better
than
he
as
a
preface
and
note
of
warning
to
them
all
he
reiterates
the
words
of
the
preacher
there
is
no
new
thing
under
the
sun
yes
says
goethe
there
is
nothing
worth
thinking
but
it
has
been
thought
before
must
only
try
to
think
it
it
is
only
when
we
are
faithful
he
says
elsewhere
in
arresting
and
noting
our
present
thoughts
that
we
have
any
joy
in
tradition
since
we
find
the
best
thoughts
already
uttered
the
finest
feelings
already
expressed
this
it
is
that
gives
us
the
perception
of
that
harmonious
agreement
to
which
man
is
called
and
to
which
he
must
conform
often
against
his
will
as
he
is
much
too
fond
of
fancying
that
the
world
begins
afresh
with
himself
what
goethe
means
is
that
we
shall
do
best
to
find
out
the
truth
of
all
things
for
ourselves
for
on
one
side
truth
is
individual
and
that
we
shall
be
happy
if
our
individual
truth
is
also
universal
or
accords
with
the
wisest
thought
of
the
past
it
is
in
this
practical
light
that
we
must
view
the
maxims
and
not
as
mere
academic
generalities
it
is
easy
to
read
them
in
an
hour
and
forget
them
as
soon
easy
to
view
them
with
a
tepid
interest
as
the
work
of
a
great
author
but
no
one
will
fully
understand
the
value
of
any
of
them
who
has
not
experience
enough
to
know
its
truth
well
is
it
for
us
if
with
the
experience
we
also
gain
the
truth
if
any
one
should
say
that
some
of
these
maxims
are
very
obvious
and
so
simply
true
as
almost
to
be
platitudes
i
would
bid
him
remember
that
the
best
education
is
often
to
discover
these
very
simple
truths
for
oneself
and
learn
to
see
how
much
there
is
in
commonplaces
for
those
who
have
grown
old
in
the
world
are
never
weary
of
telling
us
that
the
further
we
go
the
more
we
shall
find
in
general
that
the
same
things
will
happen
to
us
as
have
happened
to
others
and
it
will
then
be
our
advantage
if
we
have
the
same
reflections
best
of
all
if
we
come
of
ourselves
to
the
same
conclusions
as
the
wisest
of
those
who
have
gone
before
us
next
best
if
we
can
really
and
intelligently
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
their
thought
but
although
the
matter
of
goethe
sayings
is
not
original
in
the
sense
of
being
new
to
the
world
while
it
was
original
for
him
since
he
discovered
it
for
himself
and
on
his
own
path
their
manner
is
something
new
and
their
range
is
unparalleled
take
any
other
set
of
maxims
you
will
nowhere
is
there
so
wide
an
outlook
nowhere
so
just
an
estimate
of
human
difficulties
nowhere
an
aim
at
once
so
lofty
and
so
practicable
nowhere
is
there
a
larger
stronger
healthier
more
tolerant
view
of
life
and
the
world
or
an
atmosphere
clearer
of
the
mists
that
too
often
obscure
and
distort
our
vision
and
in
their
expression
nowhere
is
there
so
little
of
the
besetting
sin
to
sacrifice
truth
to
effect
goethe
has
none
of
the
shallow
malice
and
uncharitable
candour
that
with
writers
of
an
earlier
age
passed
for
the
practical
wisdom
of
every
day
and
we
need
only
contrast
his
maxims
with
the
similar
work
of
la
rochefoucauld
helvetius
and
chamfort
admirable
as
they
may
be
in
their
exposure
of
human
selfishness
to
determine
on
which
side
is
the
greater
service
to
mankind
how
different
the
views
of
the
world
taken
by
how
many
writers
the
secret
of
it
all
is
that
the
men
themselves
are
different
it
was
said
of
goethe
that
his
heart
which
few
knew
was
as
great
as
his
intellect
which
all
knew
certainly
his
writings
and
not
least
his
maxims
are
a
profound
example
of
the
truth
that
in
the
last
resort
it
is
moral
rather
than
intellectual
qualities
that
make
great
literature
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
much
may
be
done
by
a
mere
facility
of
style
a
command
of
words
a
fine
taste
a
wide
acquaintance
with
the
turns
and
resources
of
language
but
in
the
end
the
effect
is
produced
by
the
man
himself
his
character
and
his
strength
to
the
strenuous
earnest
man
like
goethe
the
world
offers
a
stirring
spectacle
and
provides
a
great
opportunity
and
he
grasps
and
uses
them
both
to
the
best
of
his
peculiar
capacity
it
is
diversity
of
temperament
dealing
with
partial
knowledge
that
makes
so
many
and
such
various
doctrines
a
man
views
of
life
are
in
short
those
which
he
deserves
to
have
and
his
writings
are
cast
in
the
mould
of
his
character
it
is
no
more
strange
that
the
authors
of
books
should
give
us
such
varied
pictures
of
the
humanity
around
us
than
that
painters
should
conceive
natural
objects
so
differently
literature
too
is
like
a
gallery
of
landscape
and
portrait
it
is
the
same
world
which
is
presented
the
same
men
and
things
but
the
way
of
looking
at
it
varies
with
the
artist
who
whatever
his
training
may
have
been
will
see
in
nature
what
he
brings
to
it
himself
est
homo
additus
if
this
be
truly
to
define
the
essence
and
method
of
art
it
is
equally
true
to
say
that
literature
is
man
added
to
life
and
here
as
there
everything
depends
on
the
character
and
capacity
of
the
man
no
one
has
as
yet
said
that
he
doubts
goethe
capacity
although
there
are
many
who
have
solemnly
pronounced
him
uninteresting
the
critic
who
can
read
goethe
works
with
real
attention
and
then
venture
to
call
them
dull
is
simply
showing
that
he
has
no
call
to
the
office
he
assumes
or
no
interest
in
literature
of
the
highest
class
what
is
true
of
course
is
that
goethe
is
profoundly
serious
and
he
is
therefore
not
always
entertaining
but
that
is
enough
to
make
him
pass
for
dull
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
take
literature
only
as
a
pastime
a
substitute
for
a
cigar
or
something
to
lull
them
to
sleep
when
they
are
tired
but
another
and
more
formidable
accusation
is
made
against
goethe
which
affects
his
character
and
would
go
far
to
destroy
the
value
of
his
writings
if
it
were
true
but
to
many
it
is
curiously
inconsistent
with
the
other
charge
of
being
dull
it
is
that
he
is
immoral
now
of
all
the
great
writers
of
the
world
goethe
is
admittedly
the
greatest
teacher
he
is
essentially
and
frankly
didactic
and
nowhere
is
there
so
large
and
worthy
a
body
of
literature
from
a
single
pen
which
is
informed
with
so
high
and
so
serious
a
purpose
roundly
to
call
its
author
immoral
is
a
charge
which
sufficiently
refutes
itself
by
its
own
ignorance
and
absurdity
the
charge
comes
as
a
rule
from
those
who
judge
life
by
the
needs
and
duties
of
a
young
girl
and
they
confound
the
whole
of
morality
character
and
conduct
in
all
relations
to
with
one
section
of
it
they
forget
that
goethe
was
a
man
of
the
old
that
his
faults
were
those
of
his
time
and
class
they
forget
that
an
extreme
repugnance
to
all
monasticism
asceticism
and
roman
catholicism
in
general
naturally
led
him
to
pay
a
diminished
regard
to
the
one
virtue
of
which
the
christian
world
is
sometimes
apt
to
exaggerate
the
importance
and
on
which
it
is
often
ready
to
hang
all
the
law
and
the
prophets
to
some
again
goethe
appears
to
be
a
supremely
selfish
wizard
dissecting
human
passion
in
the
coldest
blood
and
making
poetical
capital
out
of
the
emotional
tortures
he
caused
in
others
this
too
is
a
charge
which
the
merest
acquaintance
with
his
life
and
work
must
of
necessity
refute
it
is
too
simple
a
slander
to
be
seriously
discussed
since
these
are
charges
which
have
however
kept
many
estimable
people
from
reading
goethe
it
may
be
some
consolation
to
them
to
know
that
the
maxims
are
entirely
free
from
any
possibility
of
objection
on
this
ground
the
element
of
moral
teaching
which
runs
through
goethe
mature
works
like
a
golden
thread
in
the
maxims
free
and
detached
from
the
poetic
and
romantic
environment
which
in
such
varied
shapes
is
woven
around
it
in
tasso
above
all
in
to
do
the
next
duty
to
meet
the
claims
of
each
day
to
persist
with
a
single
mind
and
unwearied
effort
on
a
definite
positive
productive
path
cheerfully
to
renounce
what
is
denied
us
and
vigorously
to
make
the
best
of
what
we
have
to
restrain
vague
desires
and
uncertain
aims
to
cease
bewailing
the
vanity
of
all
things
and
the
fleeting
nature
of
this
our
world
and
do
what
we
can
to
make
our
stay
in
it
of
lasting
use
these
are
lessons
which
will
always
be
needed
and
all
the
more
needed
as
life
becomes
increasingly
complex
they
are
taught
in
the
maxims
with
a
great
variety
of
application
and
nowhere
so
concisely
summarised
as
in
one
of
them
the
mind
endowed
with
active
powers
so
it
runs
and
keeping
with
a
practical
object
to
the
task
that
lies
nearest
is
the
worthiest
there
is
on
earth
goethe
has
been
called
and
with
truth
the
prophet
of
culture
but
the
word
is
often
misunderstood
we
can
not
too
clearly
see
that
what
is
here
meant
is
not
a
mere
range
of
intellectual
knowledge
pursued
with
idolatrous
devotion
it
is
moral
discipline
a
practical
endeavour
forming
wise
thought
and
noble
character
and
this
is
the
product
not
of
learning
but
of
work
if
we
are
to
know
and
realise
what
there
is
in
us
and
make
the
best
of
it
our
aim
must
be
practical
and
creative
let
every
man
he
urges
ask
himself
with
which
of
his
faculties
he
can
and
will
somehow
influence
his
age
and
again
from
this
time
forward
if
a
man
does
not
apply
himself
to
some
art
or
handiwork
he
will
be
in
a
bad
way
in
the
rapid
changes
of
the
world
knowledge
is
no
longer
a
furtherance
by
the
time
a
man
has
taken
note
of
everything
he
has
lost
himself
the
culture
of
which
he
speaks
is
not
mainly
intellectual
we
use
the
word
in
a
way
that
is
apt
to
limit
and
conceal
its
meaning
and
we
often
apply
it
to
a
strange
form
of
mental
growth
at
once
stunted
and
overfed
to
which
if
we
may
judge
by
its
fruits
any
breath
of
real
culture
would
be
fatal
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
learning
in
the
general
and
narrow
sense
of
the
word
or
with
the
often
pernicious
effects
of
mere
learning
in
the
language
of
the
hour
we
are
wont
to
give
the
exclusive
name
of
culture
to
a
wide
acquaintance
with
books
and
languages
whether
or
not
it
results
as
it
has
before
now
resulted
in
a
want
of
culture
in
character
and
outward
demeanour
in
airs
of
conceit
in
foolish
arrogance
in
malice
and
acrimony
a
uniform
activity
with
a
moral
aim
that
in
goethe
view
is
the
highest
we
can
achieve
in
life
character
in
matters
great
and
small
consists
he
says
in
a
man
steadily
pursuing
the
things
of
which
he
feels
himself
capable
it
is
the
gospel
of
work
our
endeavour
must
be
to
realise
our
best
self
in
deed
and
action
to
strive
until
our
personality
attains
in
aristotle
word
its
entelechy
its
full
development
by
this
alone
can
we
resolve
all
the
doubts
and
hesitations
and
conflicts
within
that
undermine
and
destroy
the
soul
try
to
do
your
duty
and
you
will
know
at
once
what
you
are
worth
and
with
all
our
doing
what
should
be
the
goal
of
our
activity
in
no
wise
our
own
self
our
own
weal
a
man
is
happy
only
when
he
delights
in
the
of
others
and
we
must
of
a
truth
give
up
existence
in
order
to
exist
we
must
never
suppose
that
happiness
is
identical
with
personal
welfare
in
the
moral
sphere
we
need
as
kant
taught
a
categorical
imperative
but
says
goethe
that
is
not
the
end
of
the
matter
it
is
only
the
beginning
we
must
widen
our
conception
of
duty
and
recognise
a
perfect
morality
only
where
a
man
loves
what
he
commands
himself
to
do
voluntary
dependence
is
the
best
state
and
how
should
that
be
possible
without
love
and
just
in
the
same
sense
goethe
refuses
to
regard
all
as
virtuous
but
only
the
that
leads
to
some
useful
end
all
other
forms
of
it
are
immoral
since
they
stunt
and
cramp
the
free
development
of
what
is
best
in
us
the
desire
namely
to
deal
effectively
with
our
present
life
and
make
the
most
and
fairest
of
it
and
here
it
is
that
goethe
moral
code
is
fused
with
his
religious
belief
piety
he
says
is
not
an
end
but
a
means
a
means
of
attaining
the
highest
culture
by
the
purest
tranquillity
of
soul
this
is
the
piety
he
preaches
not
the
morbid
introspection
that
leads
to
no
useful
end
the
state
of
brooding
melancholy
the
timorous
the
anxious
speculation
as
to
some
other
condition
of
being
and
this
tranquillity
of
soul
goethe
taught
that
it
should
be
ours
in
spite
of
the
thousand
ills
of
life
which
give
us
pause
in
our
optimism
it
is
attained
by
the
firm
assurance
that
somewhere
and
somehow
a
power
exists
that
makes
for
moral
good
that
our
moral
endeavours
are
met
so
to
speak
by
a
moral
order
in
the
universe
which
comes
to
the
aid
of
individual
effort
and
the
sum
and
substance
of
his
teaching
whether
in
the
maxims
or
in
any
other
of
his
mature
productions
is
that
we
must
resign
ourselves
to
this
power
in
gratitude
and
reverence
towards
it
and
all
its
manifestations
in
whatever
is
good
and
beautiful
this
is
goethe
strong
faith
his
perfect
and
serene
trust
he
finely
shadows
it
forth
in
the
closing
words
of
where
eos
proclaims
that
the
work
of
the
gods
is
to
lead
our
efforts
to
the
eternal
good
and
that
we
must
give
them
free
play

lasst

and
so
too
in
it
is
the
long
struggle
to
realise
an
ideal
dimly
seen
on
life
labyrinthine
way
of
error
that
leads
at
last
to
the
perfect
redemption
wer

and
throughout
the
perplexities
of
life
and
the
world
where
all
things
are
but
signs
and
tokens
of
some
inner
and
hidden
reality
it
is
the
ideal
of
love
and
service
that
draws
us
on
but
this
assurance
can
not
be
reached
by
a
mere
theory
and
goethe
is
not
slow
to
declare
how
he
views
attempts
to
reach
it
in
that
way
deum
that
he
reminds
us
here
is
a
fine
a
worthy
thing
to
say
but
to
recognise
god
when
and
where
he
reveals
himself
is
the
only
true
bliss
on
earth
all
else
is
mystery
we
are
not
born
as
he
said
to
eckermann
to
solve
the
problems
of
the
world
but
to
find
out
where
the
problem
begins
and
then
to
keep
within
the
limits
of
what
we
can
grasp
the
problem
he
urged
is
transformed
into
a
postulate
if
we
can
not
get
a
solution
theoretically
we
can
get
it
in
the
experience
of
practical
life
we
reach
it
by
the
use
of
an
active
scepticism
of
which
he
says
that
it
continually
aims
at
overcoming
itself
and
arriving
by
means
of
regulated
experience
at
a
kind
of
conditioned
certainty
but
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
doctrinal
systems
and
like
schiller
professed
none
of
the
forms
of
religion
from
a
feeling
of
religion
itself
to
see
how
he
views
some
particular
questions
of
theology
the
reader
may
turn
with
profit
to
his
maxims
on
the
reformation
and
early
christianity
and
to
his
admirable
remarks
on
the
use
and
abuse
of
the
bible
the
basis
of
religion
was
for
him
its
own
earnestness
and
it
was
not
always
needful
he
held
for
truth
to
take
a
definite
shape
it
is
enough
if
it
hovers
about
us
like
a
spirit
and
produces
harmony
i
believe
he
said
to
eckermann
in
god
and
nature
and
the
victory
of
good
over
evil
but
i
was
also
asked
to
believe
that
three
was
one
and
one
was
three
that
jarred
upon
my
feeling
for
truth
and
i
did
not
see
how
it
could
have
helped
me
in
the
least
as
for
letting
our
minds
roam
beyond
this
present
life
he
thought
there
was
actual
danger
in
it
although
he
looked
for
a
future
existence
a
continuation
of
work
and
activity
in
which
what
is
here
incomplete
should
reach
its
full
development
and
whatever
be
the
secrets
of
the
universe
assuredly
the
best
we
can
do
is
to
do
our
best
here
and
the
worst
of
blasphemies
is
to
regard
this
life
as
altogether
vanity
for
as
these
pages
tell
us
it
would
not
be
worth
while
to
see
seventy
years
if
all
the
wisdom
of
this
world
were
foolishness
with
god
in
goethe
we
pass
as
over
a
bridge
from
the
eighteenth
century
to
the
nineteenth
but
though
he
lived
to
see
a
third
of
the
nineteenth
century
he
hardly
belongs
to
it
of
its
political
characteristics
he
had
few
or
none
he
was
no
democrat
as
the
prophet
of
inward
culture
he
took
the
french
revolution
for
a
disturbance
an
interruption
and
not
a
development
in
the
progress
of
the
world
history
and
for
all
its
horrors
and
the
pernicious
demoralisation
of
its
leaders
he
had
the
profoundest
aversion
but
afterwards
he
came
to
see
that
it
had
beneficial
results
that
a
revolution
is
ultimately
never
the
fault
of
the
people
but
of
the
injustice
and
incapacity
of
the
government
and
that
where
there
is
a
real
necessity
for
a
great
reform
the
old
leaven
must
be
rooted
out
but
he
knew
the
danger
of
such
a
process
and
he
indicates
it
here
in
an
admirable
saying
before
the
french
revolution
it
was
all
afterwards
it
all
changed
to
and
this
may
be
supplemented
by
his
opinion
on
the
nature
of
revolutionary
sentiments
men
think
they
would
be
if
they
were
not
ruled
and
fail
to
perceive
that
they
can
rule
neither
themselves
nor
others
and
if
he
had
thus
no
theoretical
sympathy
with
democratic
movements
he
had
little
feeling
for
that
other
great
political
tendency
of
our
time
nationality
convinced
as
he
was
that
interest
in
the
weal
and
woe
of
another
people
is
always
a
mark
of
the
highest
culture
but
apart
from
politics
there
is
one
characteristic
of
our
own
time
in
which
he
fully
and
especially
shares
if
only
for
the
reason
that
he
did
much
himself
to
produce
it
and
herein
he
has
influenced
us
profoundly
and
is
influencing
us
still
the
nineteenth
century
has
this
advantage
over
every
preceding
age
that
in
it
for
the
first
time
honest
doubt
instead
of
distinguishing
a
few
has
become
a
common
virtue
goethe
is
one
of
the
surest
and
safest
of
those
who
have
led
the
transition
we
praise
the
eighteenth
century
he
writes
for
concerning
itself
chiefly
with
analysis
the
task
remaining
to
the
nineteenth
is
to
discover
the
false
syntheses
which
prevail
and
to
analyse
their
contents
anew
of
the
aim
of
analysis
and
the
proper
course
of
inquiry
no
one
has
given
a
better
account
than
goethe
in
what
he
says
in
the
words
i
have
quoted
about
active
scepticism
and
in
the
sphere
of
morals
and
religion
it
will
perhaps
be
found
hereafter
that
he
has
contributed
in
some
degree
at
least
to
the
attainment
of
that
conditioned
certainty
for
which
as
we
hope
all
our
efforts
are
made
in
the
maxims
on
literature
there
is
some
excellent
criticism
on
literary
methods
and
much
that
may
well
be
taken
to
heart
by
certain
writers
of
our
own
day
goethe
had
little
but
rebuke
for
the
whole
of
the
romantic
movement
which
began
in
his
old
age
the
german
form
of
it
he
thought
unnatural
and
at
best
a
conventional
imitation
of
an
earlier
period
and
the
french
form
of
which
victor
hugo
was
then
the
rising
star
he
thought
a
perversion
of
naturalism
an
exaggeration
of
it
until
it
became
insipid
or
merely
revolting
to
byron
alone
he
gave
the
tribute
of
the
most
ungrudging
admiration
in
the
opposition
between
classicism
and
romanticism
he
declined
to
take
him
for
a
follower
of
either
but
as
the
complete
representative
of
his
own
time
the
maxim
that
the
classical
is
health
and
the
romantic
disease
may
not
altogether
commend
itself
to
us
now
but
with
wonderful
insight
goethe
foresaw
the
direction
in
which
the
romantic
movement
would
lead
the
romantic
he
says
here
is
already
fallen
into
its
own
abysm
it
is
hard
to
imagine
anything
more
degraded
than
the
worst
of
the
new
productions
if
he
could
have
said
this
two
generations
ago
what
would
he
have
said
now
how
could
he
have
spoken
without
contempt
of
those
who
make
all
that
is
common
and
unclean
in
itself
a
subject
with
which
literature
may
properly
be
occupied
these
are
the
writers
who
profess
to
be
realists
under
a
completely
mistaken
notion
of
what
realism
means
as
applied
to
art
and
to
them
the
chief
realities
seem
to
be
just
the
very
things
that
decent
people
keep
out
of
sight
they
forget
that
in
literature
as
in
all
art
the
dominating
realities
are
the
highest
ideals
as
an
antidote
to
this
poison
of
corruption
goethe
pointed
to
the
ancient
world
and
bid
us
study
there
the
types
of
the
loftiest
manhood
bodies
which
rot
while
they
are
still
alive
and
are
edified
by
the
detailed
contemplation
of
their
own
decay
dead
men
who
remain
in
the
world
for
the
ruin
of
others
and
feed
their
death
on
the
living
to
this
he
exclaimed
have
come
our
makers
of
literature
when
the
same
thing
happened
in
antiquity
it
was
only
as
a
strange
token
of
some
rare
disease
but
with
the
moderns
the
disease
has
become
endemic
and
epidemic
akin
to
these
and
coming
under
the
same
ban
are
some
of
our
modern
who
do
indeed
avoid
the
depth
of
degradation
but
try
to
move
the
feelings
by
dwelling
in
a
similar
fashion
on
matters
which
are
not
and
never
can
be
fit
subjects
of
literary
treatment
such
as
painful
deaths
by
horrible
distempers
or
the
minute
details
of
prolonged
operations
it
is
poor
skill
that
can
not
find
material
enough
in
the
moral
sufferings
of
men
and
women
and
is
driven
to
seek
effect
in
descriptions
of
disease
and
surgery
surely
in
any
literature
worthy
of
the
name
these
are
topics
which
a
richer
imagination
and
a
more
prolific
art
would
have
found
unnecessary
and
better
taste
would
have
left
undescribed
to
another
class
of
writers
those
who
handle
a
pretty
pen
without
having
anything
definite
to
present
or
anything
important
to
say
goethe
has
also
an
applicable
word
it
is
a
class
which
is
always
increasing
in
number
and
tends
to
increase
in
talent
we
may
admit
that
or
work
especially
in
poetry
was
never
before
done
so
well
as
it
is
done
now
and
still
we
may
find
some
useful
truth
in
a
distinction
which
goethe
drew
for
the
benefit
of
the
minor
poets
and
the
minor
of
his
own
age
productions
are
now
possible
he
said
which
without
being
bad
have
no
value
they
have
no
value
because
they
contain
nothing
and
they
are
not
bad
because
a
general
form
of
good
workmanship
is
present
to
the
author
mind
in
one
of
the
many
neglected
volumes
of
his
miscellaneous
writings
goethe
has
a
series
of
admirable
notes
for
a
proposed
work
on
and
there
the
reader
if
he
is
interested
in
goethe
literary
criticism
will
find
some
instructive
remarks
in
close
connection
with
this
aphorism
and
also
certain
rules
for
discriminating
between
good
and
indifferent
work
which
ought
to
receive
the
most
attentive
study
and
the
stylists
who
neglect
plain
language
for
a
mosaic
of
curious
phrase
and
overstrained
epithet
may
profitably
remember
that
as
goethe
here
says
it
is
not
language
in
itself
which
is
correct
or
forcible
or
elegant
but
the
mind
that
is
embodied
in
it
translators
he
tells
us
sing
the
praises
of
some
beauty
and
rouse
an
irresistible
longing
for
the
original
to
them
also
he
gives
a
piece
of
excellent
advice
the
translator
must
proceed
until
he
reaches
the
untranslatable
this
is
a
counsel
of
exhortation
as
well
as
of
warning
it
bids
the
translator
spare
no
effort
but
tells
him
that
at
a
certain
point
his
efforts
are
of
no
avail
but
none
the
less
goethe
might
have
added
the
faithful
translator
must
strive
as
if
this
hindrance
to
perfection
did
not
exist
for
it
is
thus
only
that
he
or
any
one
else
can
do
anything
worth
doing
on
methods
of
translation
much
may
be
said
and
it
is
sometimes
urged
in
a
given
case
that
it
is
not
literal
or
that
it
is
too
free
a
distinguished
writer
has
recently
laid
down
that
a
translation
should
reproduce
every
word
and
phrase
and
sentence
of
the
original
as
accurately
as
a
delicate
tracing
reproduces
the
lines
of
a
drawing
this
is
advice
which
may
hold
in
the
but
i
venture
to
maintain
nowhere
else
in
so
far
as
every
language
has
a
peculiar
genius
a
literal
translation
must
necessarily
be
a
bad
one
and
any
faithful
translation
will
of
its
nature
be
free
in
other
words
a
translator
will
err
if
he
slavishly
adheres
to
mere
expression
he
must
have
complete
liberty
to
give
his
author
meaning
and
style
in
the
manner
which
he
holds
to
be
truest
to
the
original
and
so
in
translating
from
a
foreign
tongue
it
will
be
well
for
him
to
have
some
knowledge
of
his
own
but
he
must
guard
against
the
abuse
of
his
position
his
liberty
may
become
license
and
his
translation
instead
of
being
faithful
may
be
phantastic
the
translator
first
and
last
duty
is
then
to
efface
himself
his
first
duty
is
to
stand
entirely
at
the
point
of
view
of
his
author
thought
his
last
to
find
the
clearest
and
nearest
expression
in
his
own
language
both
for
that
thought
and
for
whatever
is
characteristic
in
the
way
of
conveying
it
neither
adding
anything
of
his
own
nor
taking
away
anything
from
his
author
the
best
translation
is
thus
a
of
the
author
spirit
a
real
metempsychosis
nothing
can
be
done
without
ideals
and
this
is
the
ideal
at
which
the
present
translation
aims
that
it
fails
of
its
aim
and
has
many
defects
no
one
knows
better
than
the
translator
himself
and
he
can
only
cherish
the
hope
that
where
he
falls
short
he
is
sometimes
close
to
the
confines
of
what
can
not
be
translated

up
with
some
false
notion
and
doing
just
the
opposite
of
what
he
wants
to
do
and
then
because
the
whole
bent
of
his
mind
is
spoilt
bungling
miserably
over
everything
be
genuine
and
strenuous
earn
for
yourself
and
look
for
grace
from
those
in
high
places
from
the
powerful
favour
from
the
active
and
the
good
advancement
from
the
many
affection
from
the
individual
love
tell
me
with
whom
you
associate
and
i
will
tell
you
who
you
are
if
i
know
what
your
business
is
i
know
what
can
be
made
of
you
every
man
must
think
after
his
own
fashion
for
on
his
own
path
he
finds
a
truth
or
a
kind
of
truth
which
helps
him
through
life
but
he
must
not
give
himself
the
rein
he
must
control
himself
mere
naked
instinct
does
not
become
him
unqualified
activity
of
whatever
kind
leads
at
last
to
bankruptcy
in
the
works
of
mankind
as
in
those
of
nature
it
is
really
the
motive
which
is
chiefly
worth
attention
men
get
out
of
countenance
with
themselves
and
others
because
they
treat
the
means
as
the
end
and
so
from
sheer
doing
do
nothing
or
perhaps
just
what
they
would
have
avoided
our
plans
and
designs
should
be
so
perfect
in
truth
and
beauty
that
in
touching
them
the
world
could
only
mar
we
should
thus
have
the
advantage
of
setting
right
what
is
wrong
and
restoring
what
is
destroyed
it
is
a
very
hard
and
troublesome
thing
to
dispose
of
whole
and
to
sift
them
and
assign
the
portion
of
truth
to
its
proper
place
it
is
not
always
needful
for
truth
to
take
a
definite
shape
it
is
enough
if
it
hovers
about
us
like
a
spirit
and
produces
harmony
if
it
is
wafted
through
the
air
like
the
sound
of
a
bell
grave
and
kindly
general
ideas
and
great
conceit
are
always
in
a
fair
way
to
bring
about
terrible
misfortune
you
can
not
play
the
flute
by
blowing
alone
you
must
use
your
fingers
in
botany
there
is
a
species
of
plants
called
and
just
in
the
same
way
it
can
be
said
that
there
are
men
who
are
incomplete
and
imperfect
they
are
those
whose
desires
and
struggles
are
out
of
proportion
to
their
actions
and
achievements
the
most
insignificant
man
can
be
complete
if
he
works
within
the
limits
of
his
capacities
innate
or
acquired
but
even
fine
talents
can
be
obscured
neutralised
and
destroyed
by
lack
of
this
indispensable
requirement
of
symmetry
this
is
a
mischief
which
will
often
occur
in
modern
times
for
who
will
be
able
to
come
up
to
the
claims
of
an
age
so
full
and
intense
as
this
and
one
too
that
moves
so
rapidly
it
is
only
men
of
practical
ability
knowing
their
powers
and
using
them
with
moderation
and
prudence
who
will
be
successful
in
worldly
affairs
it
is
a
great
error
to
take
oneself
for
more
than
one
is
or
for
less
than
one
is
worth
from
time
to
time
i
meet
with
a
youth
in
whom
i
can
wish
for
no
alteration
or
improvement
only
i
am
sorry
to
see
how
often
his
nature
makes
him
quite
ready
to
swim
with
the
stream
of
the
time
and
it
is
on
this
that
i
would
always
insist
that
man
in
his
fragile
boat
has
the
rudder
placed
in
his
hand
just
that
he
may
not
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
waves
but
follow
the
direction
of
his
own
insight
but
how
is
a
young
man
to
come
of
himself
to
see
blame
in
things
which
every
one
is
busy
with
which
every
one
approves
and
promotes
why
should
he
not
follow
his
natural
bent
and
go
in
the
same
direction
as
they
i
must
hold
it
for
the
greatest
calamity
of
our
time
which
lets
nothing
come
to
maturity
that
one
moment
is
consumed
by
the
next
and
the
day
spent
in
the
day
so
that
a
man
is
always
living
from
hand
to
mouth
without
having
anything
to
show
for
it
have
we
not
already
newspapers
for
every
hour
of
the
day
a
good
head
could
assuredly
intercalate
one
or
other
of
them
they
publish
abroad
everything
that
every
one
does
or
is
busy
with
or
meditating
nay
his
very
designs
are
thereby
dragged
into
publicity
no
one
can
rejoice
or
be
sorry
but
as
a
pastime
for
others
and
so
it
goes
on
from
house
to
house
from
city
to
city
from
kingdom
to
kingdom
and
at
last
from
one
hemisphere
to
the
other
all
in
post
haste
as
little
as
you
can
stifle
a
so
little
can
you
do
this
in
the
moral
sphere
either
the
activity
of
commerce
the
rush
and
rustle
of
the
of
debts
to
pay
debts
all
these
are
the
monstrous
elements
to
which
in
these
days
a
young
man
is
exposed
well
is
it
for
him
if
he
is
gifted
by
nature
with
a
sober
quiet
temperament
neither
to
make
claims
on
the
world
out
of
all
proportion
to
his
position
nor
yet
let
the
world
determine
it
but
on
all
sides
he
is
threatened
by
the
spirit
of
the
day
and
nothing
is
more
needful
than
to
make
him
see
early
enough
the
direction
in
which
his
will
has
to
steer
the
significance
of
the
most
harmless
words
and
actions
grows
with
the
years
and
if
i
see
any
one
about
me
for
any
length
of
time
i
always
try
to
show
him
the
difference
there
is
between
sincerity
confidence
and
indiscretion
nay
that
in
truth
there
is
no
difference
at
all
but
a
gentle
transition
from
what
is
most
innocent
to
what
is
most
hurtful
a
transition
which
must
be
perceived
or
rather
felt
herein
we
must
exercise
our
tact
otherwise
in
the
very
way
in
which
we
have
won
the
favour
of
mankind
we
run
the
risk
of
trifling
it
away
again
unawares
this
is
a
lesson
which
a
man
learns
quite
well
for
himself
in
the
course
of
life
but
only
after
having
paid
a
dear
price
for
it
nor
can
he
unhappily
spare
his
posterity
a
like
expenditure
love
of
truth
shows
itself
in
this
that
a
man
knows
how
to
find
and
value
the
good
in
everything
character
calls
forth
character
if
i
am
to
listen
to
another
man
opinion
it
must
be
expressed
positively
of
things
problematical
i
have
enough
in
myself
superstition
is
a
part
of
the
very
being
of
humanity
and
when
we
fancy
that
we
are
banishing
it
altogether
it
takes
refuge
in
the
strangest
nooks
and
corners
and
then
suddenly
comes
forth
again
as
soon
as
it
believes
itself
at
all
safe
i
keep
silence
about
many
things
for
i
do
not
want
to
put
people
out
of
countenance
and
i
am
well
content
if
they
are
pleased
with
things
that
annoy
me
everything
that
frees
our
spirit
without
giving
us
control
of
ourselves
is
ruinous
a
man
is
really
alive
only
when
he
delights
in
the
of
others
piety
is
not
an
end
but
a
means
a
means
of
attaining
the
highest
culture
by
the
purest
tranquillity
of
soul
hence
it
may
be
observed
that
those
who
set
up
piety
as
an
end
and
object
are
mostly
hypocrites
when
a
man
is
old
he
must
do
more
than
when
he
was
young
to
fulfil
a
duty
is
still
always
to
feel
it
as
a
debt
for
it
is
never
quite
satisfying
to
oneself
defects
are
perceived
only
by
one
who
has
no
love
therefore
to
see
them
a
man
must
become
uncharitable
but
not
more
so
than
is
necessary
for
the
purpose
the
greatest
piece
of
good
fortune
is
that
which
corrects
our
deficiencies
and
redeems
our
mistakes
reading
ought
to
mean
understanding
writing
ought
to
mean
knowing
something
believing
ought
to
mean
comprehending
when
you
desire
a
thing
you
will
have
to
take
it
when
you
demand
it
you
will
not
get
it
and
when
you
are
experienced
you
ought
to
be
useful
to
others
the
stream
is
friendly
to
the
miller
whom
it
serves
it
likes
to
pour
over
the
mill
wheels
what
is
the
good
of
it
stealing
through
the
valley
in
apathy
whoso
is
content
with
pure
experience
and
acts
upon
it
has
enough
of
truth
the
growing
child
is
wise
in
this
sense
theory
is
in
itself
of
no
use
except
in
so
far
as
it
makes
us
believe
in
the
connection
of
phenomena
when
a
man
asks
too
much
and
delights
in
complication
he
is
exposed
to
perplexity
thinking
by
means
of
analogies
is
not
to
be
condemned
analogy
has
this
advantage
that
it
comes
to
no
conclusion
and
does
not
in
truth
aim
at
finality
at
all
induction
on
the
contrary
is
fatal
for
it
sets
up
an
object
and
keeps
it
in
view
and
working
on
towards
it
drags
false
and
true
with
it
in
its
train
the
absent
works
upon
us
by
tradition
the
usual
form
of
it
may
be
called
historical
a
higher
form
akin
to
the
imaginative
faculty
is
the
mythical
if
some
third
form
of
it
is
to
be
sought
behind
this
last
and
it
has
any
meaning
it
is
transformed
into
the
mystical
it
also
easily
becomes
sentimental
so
that
we
appropriate
to
our
use
only
what
suits
us
in
contemplation
as
in
action
we
must
distinguish
between
what
may
be
attained
and
what
is
unattainable
without
this
little
can
be
achieved
either
in
life
or
in
knowledge
sense
commun
est
le
génie
de
which
is
here
put
forward
as
the
genius
of
humanity
must
be
examined
first
of
all
in
the
way
it
shows
itself
if
we
inquire
the
purpose
to
which
humanity
puts
it
we
find
as
follows
humanity
is
conditioned
by
needs
if
they
are
not
satisfied
men
become
impatient
and
if
they
are
it
seems
not
to
affect
them
the
normal
man
moves
between
these
two
states
and
he
applies
his
understanding
his
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
needs
when
his
needs
are
satisfied
his
task
is
to
fill
up
the
waste
spaces
of
indifference
here
too
he
is
successful
if
his
needs
are
confined
to
what
is
nearest
and
most
necessary
but
if
they
rise
and
pass
beyond
the
sphere
of
ordinary
wants
is
no
longer
sufficient
it
is
a
genius
no
more
and
humanity
enters
on
the
region
of
error
there
is
no
piece
of
foolishness
but
it
can
be
corrected
by
intelligence
or
accident
no
piece
of
wisdom
but
it
can
miscarry
by
lack
of
intelligence
or
by
accident
every
great
idea
is
a
tyrant
when
it
first
appears
hence
the
advantages
which
it
produces
change
all
too
quickly
into
disadvantages
it
is
possible
then
to
defend
and
praise
any
institution
that
exists
if
its
beginnings
are
brought
to
remembrance
and
it
is
shown
that
everything
which
was
true
of
it
at
the
beginning
is
true
of
it
still
lessing
who
chafed
under
the
sense
of
various
limitations
makes
one
of
his
characters
say
no
one
do
anything
a
clever
pious
man
said
if
a
man
something
he
must
do
it
a
third
who
was
it
is
true
an
educated
man
added
follows
upon
the
whole
circle
of
and
was
thus
believed
to
have
been
completed
but
as
a
rule
a
man
knowledge
of
whatever
kind
it
may
be
determines
what
he
shall
do
and
what
he
shall
leave
undone
and
so
it
is
that
there
is
no
more
terrible
sight
than
ignorance
in
action
there
are
two
powers
that
make
for
peace
what
is
right
and
what
is
fitting
justice
insists
on
obligation
law
on
decorum
justice
weighs
and
decides
law
superintends
and
orders
justice
refers
to
the
individual
law
to
society
the
history
of
knowledge
is
a
great
fugue
in
which
the
voices
of
the
nations
one
after
the
other
emerge
ii
if
a
man
is
to
achieve
all
that
is
asked
of
him
he
must
take
himself
for
more
than
he
is
and
as
long
as
he
does
not
carry
it
to
an
absurd
length
we
willingly
put
up
with
it
work
makes
companionship
people
whip
curds
to
see
if
they
can
not
make
cream
of
them
it
is
much
easier
to
put
yourself
in
the
position
of
a
mind
taken
up
with
the
most
absolute
error
than
of
one
which
mirrors
to
itself
wisdom
lies
only
in
truth
when
i
err
every
one
can
see
it
but
not
when
i
lie
is
not
the
world
full
enough
of
riddles
already
without
our
making
riddles
too
out
of
the
simplest
phenomena
finest
hair
throws
a
shadow
what
i
have
tried
to
do
in
my
life
through
false
tendencies
i
have
at
last
learned
to
understand
generosity
wins
favour
for
every
one
especially
when
it
is
accompanied
by
modesty
before
the
storm
breaks
the
dust
rises
violently
for
the
last
time
the
dust
that
is
soon
to
be
laid
forever
men
do
not
come
to
know
one
another
easily
even
with
the
best
will
and
the
best
purpose
and
then
comes
in
and
distorts
everything
we
should
know
one
another
better
if
one
man
were
not
so
anxious
to
put
himself
on
an
equality
with
another
eminent
men
are
therefore
in
a
worse
plight
than
others
for
as
we
can
not
compare
ourselves
with
them
we
are
on
the
watch
for
them
in
the
world
the
point
is
not
to
know
men
but
at
any
given
moment
to
be
cleverer
than
the
man
who
stands
before
you
you
can
prove
this
at
every
fair
and
from
every
charlatan
not
everywhere
where
there
is
water
are
there
frogs
but
where
you
have
frogs
there
you
will
find
water
error
is
quite
right
as
long
as
we
are
young
but
we
must
not
carry
it
on
with
us
into
our
old
age
whims
and
eccentricities
that
grow
stale
are
all
useless
rank
nonsense
in
the
formation
of
species
nature
gets
as
it
were
into
a
she
can
not
make
her
way
through
and
is
disinclined
to
turn
back
hence
the
stubbornness
of
national
character
every
one
has
something
in
his
nature
which
if
he
were
to
express
it
openly
would
of
necessity
give
offence
if
a
man
thinks
about
his
physical
or
moral
condition
he
generally
finds
that
he
is
nature
asks
that
a
man
should
sometimes
be
stupefied
without
going
to
sleep
hence
the
pleasure
in
the
smoking
of
tobacco
the
drinking
of
brandy
the
use
of
opiates
the
man
who
is
up
and
doing
should
see
to
it
that
what
he
does
is
right
whether
or
not
right
is
done
is
a
matter
which
should
not
trouble
him
many
a
man
knocks
about
on
the
wall
with
his
hammer
and
believes
that
he
hits
the
right
nail
on
the
head
every
time
painting
and
tattooing
of
the
body
is
a
return
to
animalism
is
a
way
of
getting
rid
of
the
past
what
a
man
does
not
understand
he
does
not
possess
not
every
one
who
has
a
pregnant
thought
delivered
to
him
becomes
productive
it
probably
makes
him
think
of
something
with
which
he
is
quite
familiar

symbol
of
sovereignty

exercised
by
weak
men
every
man
has
enough
power
left
to
carry
out
that
of
which
he
is
convinced
memory
may
vanish
so
long
as
at
the
moment
judgment
does
not
fail
you
no
nation
gains
the
power
of
judgment
except
it
can
pass
judgment
on
itself
but
to
attain
this
great
privilege
takes
a
very
long
time
instead
of
contradicting
my
words
people
ought
to
act
in
my
spirit
those
who
oppose
intellectual
truths
do
but
stir
up
the
fire
and
the
cinders
fly
about
and
burn
what
they
had
else
not
touched
man
would
not
be
the
finest
creature
in
the
world
if
he
were
not
too
fine
for
it
what
a
long
time
people
were
vainly
disputing
about
the
antipodes
certain
minds
must
be
allowed
their
peculiarities
snow
is
false
purity
whoso
shrinks
from
ideas
ends
by
having
nothing
but
sensations
those
from
whom
we
are
always
learning
are
rightly
called
our
masters
but
not
every

us

it

to
what
is
in
the
end
only
salt
water
it
is
said
that
vain
stinks
in
the
nostrils
that
may
be
so
but
for
the
kind
of
smell
which
comes
from
unjust
blame
by
others
the
public
has
no
nose
at
all
there
are
problematical
natures
which
are
equal
to
no
position
in
which
they
find
themselves
and
which
no
position
satisfies
this
it
is
that
causes
that
hideous
conflict
which
wastes
life
and
deprives
it
of
all
pleasure
if
we
do
any
real
good
it
is
mostly
vi
et
dirt
glitters
as
long
as
the
sun
shines
it
is
difficult
to
be
just
to
the
passing
moment
we
are
bored
by
it
if
it
is
neither
good
nor
bad
but
the
good
moment
lays
a
task
upon
us
and
the
bad
moment
a
burden
he
is
the
happiest
man
who
can
set
the
end
of
his
life
in
connection
with
the
beginning
so
obstinately
contradictory
is
man
that
you
can
not
compel
him
to
his
advantage
yet
he
yields
before
everything
that
forces
him
to
his
hurt
forethought
is
simple
afterthought
manifold
a
state
of
things
in
which
every
day
brings
some
new
trouble
is
not
the
right
one
when
people
suffer
by
failing
to
look
before
them
nothing
is
commoner
than
trying
to
look
out
for
some
possible
remedy
the
hindoos
of
the
desert
make
a
solemn
vow
to
eat
no
fish
to
venture
an
opinion
is
like
moving
a
piece
at
chess
it
may
be
taken
but
it
forms
the
beginning
of
a
game
that
is
won
it
is
as
certain
as
it
is
strange
that
truth
and
error
come
from
one
and
the
same
source
thus
it
is
that
we
are
often
not
at
liberty
to
do
violence
to
error
because
at
the
same
time
we
do
violence
to
truth
truth
belongs
to
the
man
error
to
his
age
this
is
why
it
has
been
said
that
while
the
misfortune
of
the
age
caused
his
error
the
force
of
his
soul
made
him
emerge
from
the
error
with
glory
every
one
has
his
peculiarities
and
can
not
get
rid
of
them
and
yet
many
a
one
is
destroyed
by
his
peculiarities
and
those
too
of
the
most
innocent
kind
if
a
man
does
think
too
much
of
himself
he
is
more
than
he
believes
himself
to
be
in
art
and
knowledge
as
also
in
deed
and
action
everything
depends
on
a
pure
apprehension
of
the
object
and
a
treatment
of
it
according
to
its
nature
when
intelligent
and
sensible
people
despise
knowledge
in
their
old
age
it
is
only
because
they
have
asked
too
much
of
it
and
of
themselves
i
pity
those
who
make
much
ado
about
the
transitory
nature
of
all
things
and
are
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
earthly
vanity
are
we
not
here
to
make
the
transitory
permanent
this
we
can
do
only
if
we
know
how
to
value
both
a
rainbow
which
lasts
a
quarter
of
an
hour
is
looked
at
no
more
it
used
to
happen
and
still
happens
to
me
to
take
no
pleasure
in
a
work
of
art
at
the
first
sight
of
it
because
it
is
too
much
for
me
but
if
i
suspect
any
merit
in
it
i
try
to
get
at
it
and
then
i
never
fail
to
make
the
most
gratifying
discoveries
to
find
new
qualities
in
the
work
itself
and
new
faculties
in
myself
faith
is
private
capital
kept
in
one
own
house
there
are
public
and
which
supply
individuals
in
their
day
of
need
but
here
the
creditor
quietly
takes
his
interest
for
himself
real
obscurantism
is
not
to
hinder
the
spread
of
what
is
true
clear
and
useful
but
to
bring
into
vogue
what
is
false
during
a
prolonged
study
of
the
lives
of
various
men
both
great
and
small
i
came
upon
this
thought
in
the
web
of
the
world
the
one
may
well
be
regarded
as
the
warp
the
other
as
the
woof
it
is
the
little
men
after
all
who
give
breadth
to
the
web
and
the
great
men
firmness
and
solidity
perhaps
also
the
addition
of
some
sort
of
pattern
but
the
scissors
of
the
fates
determine
its
length
and
to
that
all
the
rest
must
join
in
submitting
itself
truth
is
a
torch
but
a
huge
one
and
so
it
is
only
with
blinking
eyes
that
we
all
of
us
try
to
get
past
it
in
actual
terror
of
being
burnt
wise
have
much
in
common
with
one
another
the
really
foolish
thing
in
men
who
are
otherwise
intelligent
is
that
they
fail
to
understand
what
another
person
says
when
he
does
not
exactly
hit
upon
the
right
way
of
saying
it
because
a
man
speaks
he
thinks
he
is
able
to
speak
about
language
one
need
only
grow
old
to
become
gentler
in
one
judgments
i
see
no
fault
committed
which
i
could
not
have
committed
myself
the
man
who
acts
never
has
any
conscience
no
one
has
any
conscience
but
the
man
who
thinks
why
should
those
who
are
happy
expect
one
who
is
miserable
to
die
before
them
in
a
graceful
attitude
like
the
gladiator
before
the
roman
mob
some
one
asked
timon
about
the
education
of
his
children
them
he
said
instructed
in
that
which
they
will
never
understand
there
are
people
whom
i
wish
well
and
would
that
i
could
wish
better
by
force
of
habit
we
look
at
a
clock
that
has
run
down
as
if
it
were
still
going
and
we
gaze
at
the
face
of
a
beauty
as
though
she
still
loved
hatred
is
active
displeasure
envy
passive
we
need
not
wonder
that
envy
turns
so
soon
to
hatred
there
is
something
magical
in
rhythm
it
even
makes
us
believe
that
we
possess
the
sublime
dilettantism
treated
seriously
and
knowledge
pursued
mechanically
end
by
becoming
pedantry
no
one
but
the
master
can
promote
the
cause
of
art
patrons
help
the
master
that
is
right
and
proper
but
that
does
not
always
mean
that
art
is
helped
the
most
foolish
of
all
errors
is
for
clever
young
men
to
believe
that
they
forfeit
their
originality
in
recognising
a
truth
which
has
already
been
recognised
by
others
scholars
are
generally
malignant
when
they
are
refuting
others
and
if
they
think
a
man
is
making
a
mistake
they
straightway
look
upon
him
as
their
mortal
enemy
beauty
can
never
really
understand
itself
iii
it
is
much
easier
to
recognise
error
than
to
find
truth
for
error
lies
on
the
surface
and
may
be
overcome
but
truth
lies
in
the
depths
and
to
search
for
it
is
not
given
to
every
one
we
all
live
on
the
past
and
through
the
past
are
destroyed
we
are
no
sooner
about
to
learn
some
great
lesson
than
we
take
refuge
in
our
own
innate
poverty
of
soul
and
yet
for
all
that
the
lesson
has
not
been
quite
in
vain
the
world
of
empirical
morality
consists
for
the
most
part
of
nothing
but
and
envy
life
seems
so
vulgar
so
easily
content
with
the
commonplace
things
of
every
day
and
yet
it
always
nurses
and
cherishes
certain
higher
claims
in
secret
and
looks
about
for
the
means
of
satisfying
them
confidences
are
strange
things
if
you
listen
only
to
one
man
it
is
possible
that
he
is
deceived
or
mistaken
if
you
listen
to
many
they
are
in
a
like
case
and
generally
you
can
not
get
at
the
truth
at
all
no
one
should
desire
to
live
in
irregular
circumstances
but
if
by
chance
a
man
falls
into
them
they
test
his
character
and
show
of
how
much
determination
he
is
capable
an
honourable
man
with
limited
ideas
often
sees
through
the
rascality
of
the
most
cunning
jobber
if
a
man
feels
no
love
he
must
learn
how
to
flatter
otherwise
he
will
not
succeed
against
criticism
a
man
can
neither
protest
nor
defend
himself
he
must
act
in
spite
of
it
and
then
criticism
will
gradually
yield
to
him
the
masses
can
not
dispense
with
men
of
ability
and
such
men
are
always
a
burden
to
them
if
a
man
spreads
my
failings
abroad
he
is
my
master
even
though
he
were
my
servant
whether
memoirs
are
written
by
masters
of
servants
or
by
servants
of
masters
the
processes
always
meet
if
you
lay
duties
upon
people
and
give
them
no
rights
you
must
pay
them
well
i
can
promise
to
be
sincere
but
not
to
be
impartial
ingratitude
is
always
a
kind
of
weakness
i
have
never
known
men
of
ability
to
be
ungrateful
we
are
all
so
limited
that
we
always
think
we
are
right
and
so
we
may
conceive
of
an
extraordinary
mind
which
not
only
errs
but
has
a
positive
delight
in
error
it
is
very
rare
to
find
pure
and
steady
activity
in
the
accomplishment
of
what
is
good
and
right
we
usually
see
pedantry
trying
to
keep
back
and
audacity
trying
to
go
on
too
fast
word
and
picture
are
correlatives
which
are
continually
in
quest
of
each
other
as
is
sufficiently
evident
in
the
case
of
metaphors
and
similes
so
from
all
time
what
was
said
or
sung
inwardly
to
the
ear
had
to
be
presented
equally
to
the
eye
and
so
in
childish
days
we
see
word
and
picture
in
continual
balance
in
the
book
of
the
law
and
in
the
way
of
salvation
in
the
bible
and
in
the
when
something
was
spoken
which
could
not
be
pictured
and
something
pictured
which
could
not
be
spoken
all
went
well
but
mistakes
were
often
made
and
a
word
was
used
instead
of
a
picture
and
thence
arose
those
monsters
of
symbolical
mysticism
which
are
doubly
an
evil
for
the
man
of
the
world
a
collection
of
anecdotes
and
maxims
is
of
the
greatest
value
if
he
knows
how
to
intersperse
the
one
in
his
conversation
at
fitting
moments
and
remember
the
other
when
a
case
arises
for
their
application
when
you
lose
interest
in
anything
you
also
lose
the
memory
for
it
the
world
is
a
bell
with
a
crack
in
it
it
rattles
but
does
not
ring
the
importunity
of
young
dilettanti
must
be
borne
with
for
as
they
grow
old
they
become
the
truest
worshippers
of
art
and
the
master
people
have
to
become
really
bad
before
they
care
for
nothing
but
mischief
and
delight
in
it
clever
people
are
the
best
encyclopædia
there
are
people
who
make
no
mistakes
because
they
never
wish
to
do
anything
worth
doing
if
i
know
my
relation
to
myself
and
the
outer
world
i
call
it
truth
every
man
can
have
his
own
peculiar
truth
and
yet
it
is
always
the
same
no
one
is
the
master
of
any
truly
productive
energy
and
all
men
must
let
it
work
on
by
itself
a
man
never
understands
how
anthropomorphic
he
is
a
difference
which
offers
nothing
to
the
understanding
is
no
difference
at
all
a
man
can
not
live
for
every
one
least
of
all
for
those
with
whom
he
would
not
care
to
live
if
a
man
sets
out
to
study
all
the
laws
he
will
have
no
time
left
to
transgress
them
things
that
are
mysterious
are
not
yet
miracles
are
not
in
my
good
books
a
frivolous
impulsive
encouragement
of
problematical
talents
was
a
mistake
of
my
early
years
and
i
have
never
been
able
to
abandon
it
altogether
i
should
like
to
be
honest
with
you
without
our
falling
out
but
it
will
not
do
you
act
wrongly
and
fall
between
two
stools
you
win
no
adherents
and
lose
your
friends
what
is
to
be
the
end
of
it
it
is
all
one
whether
you
are
of
high
or
of
humble
origin
you
will
always
have
to
pay
for
your
humanity
when
i
hear
people
speak
of
liberal
ideas
it
is
always
a
wonder
to
me
that
men
are
so
readily
put
off
with
empty
verbiage
an
idea
can
not
be
liberal
but
it
may
be
potent
vigorous
exclusive
in
order
to
fulfil
its
mission
of
being
productive
still
less
can
a
concept
be
liberal
for
a
concept
has
quite
another
mission
where
however
we
must
look
for
liberality
is
in
the
sentiments
and
the
sentiments
are
the
inner
man
as
he
lives
and
moves
a
man
sentiments
however
are
rarely
liberal
because
they
proceed
directly
from
him
personally
and
from
his
immediate
relations
and
requirements
further
we
will
not
write
and
let
us
apply
this
test
to
what
we
hear
every
day
if
a
clever
man
commits
a
folly
it
is
not
a
small
one
there
is
a
poetry
without
figures
of
speech
which
is
a
single
figure
of
speech
i
went
on
troubling
myself
about
general
ideas
until
i
learnt
to
understand
the
particular
achievements
of
the
best
men
it
is
only
when
a
man
knows
little
that
he
knows
anything
at
all
with
knowledge
grows
doubt
the
errors
of
a
man
are
what
make
him
really
lovable
there
are
men
who
love
their
like
and
seek
it
others
love
their
opposite
and
follow
after
it
if
a
man
has
always
let
himself
think
the
world
as
bad
as
the
adversary
represents
it
to
be
he
must
have
become
a
miserable
person
and
hatred
limit
the
spectator
to
the
surface
even
when
keen
perception
is
added
unto
them
but
when
keen
perception
unites
with
and
love
it
gets
at
the
heart
of
man
and
the
world
nay
it
may
hope
to
reach
the
highest
goal
of
all
raw
matter
is
seen
by
every
one
the
contents
are
found
only
by
him
who
has
his
eyes
about
him
and
the
form
is
a
secret
to
the
majority
we
may
learn
to
know
the
world
as
we
please
it
will
always
retain
a
bright
and
a
dark
side
error
is
continually
repeating
itself
in
action
and
we
must
unweariedly
repeat
the
truth
in
word
as
in
rome
there
is
apart
from
the
romans
a
population
of
statues
so
apart
from
this
real
world
there
is
a
world
of
illusion
almost
more
potent
in
which
most
men
live
mankind
is
like
the
red
sea
the
staff
has
scarcely
parted
the
waves
asunder
before
they
flow
together
again
thoughts
come
back
beliefs
persist
facts
pass
by
never
to
return
of
all
peoples
the
greeks
have
dreamt
the
dream
of
life
the
best
we
readily
bow
to
antiquity
but
not
to
posterity
it
is
only
a
father
that
does
not
grudge
talent
to
his
son
there
is
no
virtue
in
subordinating
oneself
but
there
is
virtue
in
descending
and
in
recognising
anything
as
above
us
which
is
beneath
us
the
whole
art
of
living
consists
in
giving
up
existence
in
order
to
exist
all
our
pursuits
and
actions
are
a
wearying
process
well
is
it
for
him
who
wearies
not
hope
is
the
second
soul
of
the
unhappy
love
is
a
true
renovator
mankind
is
not
without
a
wish
to
serve
hence
the
chivalry
of
the
french
is
a
servitude
in
the
theatre
the
pleasure
of
what
we
see
and
hear
restrains
our
reflections
there
is
no
limit
to
the
increase
of
experience
but
theories
can
not
become
clearer
and
more
complete
in
just
the
same
sense
the
field
of
experience
is
the
whole
universe
in
all
directions
theory
remains
shut
up
within
the
limits
of
the
human
faculties
hence
there
is
no
way
of
looking
at
the
world
but
it
recurs
and
the
curious
thing
happens
that
with
increased
experience
a
limited
theory
may
again
come
into
favour
it
is
always
the
same
world
which
stands
open
to
observation
which
is
continually
being
contemplated
or
guessed
at
and
it
is
always
the
same
men
who
live
in
the
true
or
in
the
false
more
at
their
ease
in
the
latter
than
in
the
former
truth
is
at
variance
with
our
natures
but
not
so
error
and
for
a
very
simple
reason
truth
requires
us
to
recognise
ourselves
as
limited
but
error
flatters
us
with
the
belief
that
in
one
way
or
another
we
are
subject
to
no
bounds
at
all
that
some
men
think
they
can
still
do
what
they
have
been
able
to
do
is
natural
enough
that
others
think
they
can
do
what
they
have
never
been
able
to
do
is
singular
but
not
rare
at
all
times
it
has
not
been
the
age
but
individuals
alone
who
have
worked
for
knowledge
it
was
the
age
which
put
socrates
to
death
by
poison
the
age
which
burnt
huss
the
ages
have
always
remained
alike
that
is
true
symbolism
where
the
more
particular
represents
the
more
general
not
as
a
dream
or
shade
but
as
a
vivid
instantaneous
revelation
of
the
inscrutable
everything
of
an
abstract
or
symbolic
nature
as
soon
as
it
is
challenged
by
realities
ends
by
consuming
them
and
itself
so
credit
consumes
both
money
and
itself
mastery
often
passes
for
egoism
with
protestants
as
soon
as
good
works
cease
and
their
merit
is
denied
sentimentality
takes
their
place
if
a
man
knows
where
to
get
good
advice
it
is
as
though
he
could
supply
it
himself
the
use
of
mottoes
is
to
indicate
something
we
have
not
attained
but
strive
to
attain
it
is
right
to
keep
them
always
before
our
eyes
a
man
can
not
lift
a
stone
himself
let
him
leave
it
even
though
he
has
some
one
to
help
him
despotism
promotes
general
because
from
top
to
bottom
it
makes
the
individual
responsible
and
so
produces
the
highest
degree
of
activity
a
man
must
pay
dear
for
his
errors
if
he
wishes
to
get
rid
of
them
and
even
then
he
is
lucky
enthusiasm
is
of
the
greatest
value
so
long
as
we
are
not
carried
away
by
it
school
itself
is
the
only
true
preparation
for
it
error
is
related
to
truth
as
sleep
to
waking
i
have
observed
that
on
awakening
from
error
a
man
turns
again
to
truth
as
with
new
vigour
every
one
suffers
who
does
not
work
for
himself
a
man
works
for
others
to
have
them
share
in
his
joy
men
prejudices
rest
upon
their
character
for
the
time
being
and
can
not
be
overcome
as
being
part
and
parcel
of
themselves
neither
evidence
nor
nor
reason
has
the
slightest
influence
upon
them
characters
often
make
a
law
of
their
failings
men
who
know
the
world
have
said
that
when
prudence
is
only
fear
in
disguise
its
scruples
can
not
be
conquered
the
weak
often
have
revolutionary
sentiments
they
think
they
would
be
well
off
if
they
were
not
ruled
and
fail
to
perceive
that
they
can
rule
neither
themselves
nor
others
is
born
pure
in
the
healthy
man
is
and
is
revealed
by
a
resolute
perception
and
recognition
of
what
is
necessary
and
useful
practical
men
and
women
avail
themselves
of
it
with
confidence
where
it
is
absent
both
sexes
find
anything
necessary
when
they
desire
it
and
useful
when
it
gives
them
pleasure
all
men
as
they
attain
freedom
give
play
to
their
errors
the
strong
do
too
much
and
the
weak
too
little
the
conflict
of
the
old
the
existing
the
continuing
with
development
improvement
and
reform
is
always
the
same
order
of
every
kind
turns
at
last
to
pedantry
and
to
get
rid
of
the
one
people
destroy
the
other
and
so
it
goes
on
for
a
while
until
people
perceive
that
order
must
be
established
anew
classicism
and
romanticism
close
corporations
and
freedom
of
trade
the
maintenance
of
large
estates
and
the
division
of
the
land
it
is
always
the
same
conflict
which
ends
by
producing
a
new
one
the
best
policy
of
those
in
power
would
be
so
to
moderate
this
conflict
as
to
let
it
right
itself
without
the
destruction
of
either
element
but
this
has
not
been
granted
to
men
and
it
seems
not
to
be
the
will
of
god
a
great
work
limits
us
for
the
moment
because
we
feel
it
above
our
powers
and
only
in
so
far
as
we
afterwards
incorporate
it
with
our
culture
and
make
it
part
of
our
mind
and
heart
does
it
become
a
dear
and
worthy
object
it
is
no
wonder
that
we
all
more
or
less
delight
in
the
mediocre
because
it
leaves
us
in
peace
it
gives
us
the
comfortable
feeling
of
intercourse
with
what
is
like
ourselves
there
is
no
use
in
reproving
vulgarity
for
it
never
changes
we
can
not
escape
a
contradiction
in
ourselves
we
must
try
to
resolve
it
if
the
contradiction
comes
from
others
it
does
not
affect
us
it
is
their
affair
there
are
many
things
in
the
world
that
are
at
once
good
and
excellent
but
they
do
not
come
into
contact
which
is
the
best
government
that
which
teaches
us
to
govern
ourselves
when
men
have
to
do
with
women
they
get
spun
off
like
a
distaff
it
may
well
be
that
a
man
is
at
times
horribly
threshed
by
misfortunes
public
and
private
but
the
reckless
flail
of
fate
when
it
beats
the
rich
sheaves
crushes
only
the
straw
and
the
corn
feels
nothing
of
it
and
dances
merrily
on
the
floor
careless
whether
its
way
is
to
the
mill
or
the
furrow
however
probable
it
is
that
a
desire
may
be
fulfilled
there
is
always
a
doubt
and
so
when
the
desire
is
realised
it
is
always
surprising
absurdities
presented
with
good
taste
rouse
disgust
and
admiration
of
the
best
society
it
used
to
be
said
their
speech
instructs
the
mind
and
their
silence
the
feelings
nothing
is
more
terrible
than
ignorance
in
action
beauty
and
genius
must
be
kept
afar
if
one
would
avoid
becoming
their
slave
we
treat
the
aged
with
consideration
as
we
treat
children
an
old
man
loses
one
of
the
greatest
of
human
privileges
he
is
no
more
judged
by
his
peers
in
the
matter
of
knowledge
it
has
happened
to
me
as
to
one
who
rises
early
and
in
the
dark
impatiently
awaits
the
dawn
and
then
the
sun
but
is
blinded
when
it
appears
great
primeval
powers
evolved
in
time
or
in
eternity
work
on
unceasingly
whether
to
weal
or
to
woe
is
a
matter
of
chance
iv
people
often
say
to
themselves
in
life
that
they
should
avoid
a
variety
of
occupation
and
more
particularly
be
the
less
willing
to
enter
upon
new
work
the
older
they
grow
but
it
is
easy
to
talk
easy
to
give
advice
to
oneself
and
others
to
grow
old
is
itself
to
enter
upon
a
new
business
all
the
circumstances
change
and
a
man
must
either
cease
acting
altogether
or
willingly
and
consciously
take
over
the
new
rôle
of
the
absolute
in
the
theoretical
sense
i
do
not
venture
to
speak
but
this
i
maintain
that
if
a
man
recognises
it
in
its
manifestation
and
always
keeps
his
gaze
fixed
upon
it
he
will
experience
very
great
reward
to
live
in
a
great
idea
means
to
treat
the
impossible
as
though
it
were
possible
it
is
just
the
same
with
a
strong
character
and
when
an
idea
and
a
character
meet
things
arise
which
fill
the
world
with
wonder
for
thousands
of
years
napoleon
lived
wholly
in
a
great
idea
but
he
was
unable
to
take
conscious
hold
of
it
after
utterly
disavowing
all
ideals
and
denying
them
any
reality
he
zealously
strove
to
realise
them
his
clear
incorruptible
intellect
could
not
however
tolerate
such
a
perpetual
conflict
within
and
there
is
much
value
in
the
thoughts
which
he
was
compelled
as
it
were
to
utter
and
which
are
expressed
very
peculiarly
and
with
much
charm
he
considered
the
idea
as
a
thing
of
the
mind
that
had
it
is
true
no
reality
but
still
on
passing
away
left
a
residuum
a
to
which
some
reality
could
not
be
altogether
refused
we
may
think
this
a
very
perverse
and
material
notion
but
when
he
entertained
his
friends
with
the
neverending
consequences
of
his
life
and
actions
in
full
belief
and
confidence
in
them
he
expressed
himself
quite
differently
then
indeed
he
was
ready
to
admit
that
life
produces
life
that
a
fruitful
act
has
effects
to
all
time
he
took
pleasure
in
confessing
that
he
had
given
a
great
impulse
a
new
direction
to
the
course
of
the
world
affairs
it
always
remains
a
very
remarkable
fact
that
men
whose
whole
personality
is
almost
all
idea
are
so
extremely
shy
of
all
phantasy
in
this
case
was
hamann
who
could
not
bear
the
mention
of
things
of
another
world
he
took
occasion
to
express
himself
on
this
point
in
a
certain
paragraph
which
he
wrote
in
fourteen
different
ways
and
still
apparently
he
was
never
quite
satisfied
with
it
two
of
these
attempts
have
been
preserved
to
us
a
third
we
have
ourselves
attempted
which
we
are
induced
to
print
here
by
the
preceding
observations
man
is
placed
as
a
real
being
in
the
midst
of
a
real
world
and
endowed
with
such
organs
that
he
can
perceive
and
produce
the
real
and
also
the
possible
all
healthy
men
have
the
conviction
of
their
own
existence
and
of
an
existence
around
them
however
even
the
brain
contains
a
hollow
spot
that
is
to
say
a
place
in
which
no
object
is
mirrored
just
as
in
the
eye
itself
there
is
a
little
spot
that
does
not
see
if
a
man
pays
particular
attention
to
this
spot
and
is
absorbed
in
it
he
falls
into
a
state
of
mental
sickness
has
presentiments
of
things
of
another
world
which
are
in
reality
no
things
at
all
possessing
neither
form
nor
limit
but
alarming
him
like
dark
empty
tracts
of
night
and
pursuing
him
as
something
more
than
phantoms
if
he
does
not
tear
himself
free
from
them
to
the
several
perversities
of
the
day
a
man
should
always
oppose
only
the
great
masses
of
universal
history
no
one
can
live
much
with
children
without
finding
that
they
always
react
to
any
outward
influence
upon
them
with
any
specially
childish
nature
the
reaction
is
even
passionate
while
its
action
is
energetic
that
is
why
children
lives
are
a
series
of
refined
judgments
not
to
say
prejudices
and
to
efface
a
rapid
but
partial
perception
in
order
to
make
way
for
a
more
general
one
time
is
necessary
to
bear
this
in
mind
is
one
of
the
teacher
greatest
duties
friendship
can
only
be
bred
in
practice
and
be
maintained
by
practice
affection
nay
love
itself
is
no
help
at
all
to
friendship
true
active
productive
friendship
consists
in
keeping
equal
pace
in
life
in
my
friend
approving
my
aims
while
i
approve
his
and
in
thus
moving
forwards
together
steadfastly
however
much
our
way
of
thought
and
life
may
vary
v
in
the
world
people
take
a
man
at
his
own
estimate
but
he
must
estimate
himself
at
something
disagreeableness
is
more
easily
tolerated
than
insignificance
you
can
force
anything
on
society
so
long
as
it
has
no
sequel
we
do
not
learn
to
know
men
if
they
come
to
us
we
must
go
to
them
to
find
out
what
they
are
that
we
have
many
criticisms
to
make
on
those
who
visit
us
and
that
as
soon
as
they
depart
we
pass
no
very
amiable
judgment
upon
them
seems
to
me
almost
natural
for
we
have
so
to
speak
a
right
to
measure
them
by
our
own
standard
even
intelligent
and
men
hardly
refrain
from
sharp
censure
on
such
occasions
but
if
on
the
contrary
we
have
been
in
their
homes
and
have
seen
them
in
their
surroundings
and
habits
and
the
circumstances
which
are
necessary
and
inevitable
for
them
if
we
have
seen
the
kind
of
influence
they
exert
on
those
around
them
or
how
they
behave
it
is
only
ignorance
and
that
can
find
food
for
ridicule
in
what
must
appear
to
us
in
more
than
one
sense
worthy
of
respect
what
we
call
conduct
and
good
manners
obtains
for
us
that
which
otherwise
is
to
be
obtained
only
by
force
or
not
even
by
force
women
society
is
the
element
of
good
manners
how
can
the
character
the
peculiar
nature
of
a
man
be
compatible
with
good
manners
it
is
through
his
good
manners
that
a
man
peculiar
nature
should
be
made
all
the
more
conspicuous
every
one
likes
distinction
but
it
should
not
be
disagreeable
the
most
privileged
position
in
life
as
in
society
is
that
of
an
educated
soldier
rough
warriors
at
any
rate
remain
true
to
their
character
and
as
great
strength
is
usually
the
cover
for
good
nature
we
get
on
with
them
at
need
no
one
is
more
troublesome
than
an
awkward
civilian
as
his
business
is
not
with
anything
brutal
or
coarse
he
might
be
expected
to
show
delicacy
of
feeling
when
we
live
with
people
who
have
a
delicate
sense
of
what
is
fitting
we
get
quite
anxious
about
them
if
anything
happens
to
disturb
this
sense
no
one
would
come
into
a
room
with
spectacles
on
his
nose
if
he
knew
that
women
at
once
lose
any
inclination
to
look
at
or
talk
to
him
a
familiar
in
the
place
of
a
respectful
demeanour
is
always
ridiculous
there
is
no
outward
sign
of
politeness
that
will
be
found
to
lack
some
deep
moral
foundation
the
right
kind
of
education
would
be
that
which
conveyed
the
sign
and
the
foundation
at
the
same
time
a
man
manners
are
the
mirror
in
which
he
shows
his
portrait
there
is
a
politeness
of
the
heart
and
it
is
allied
to
love
it
produces
the
most
agreeable
politeness
of
outward
demeanour
voluntary
dependence
is
the
best
state
and
how
should
that
be
possible
without
love
we
are
never
further
from
our
wishes
than
when
we
fancy
we
possess
the
object
of
them
no
one
is
more
of
a
slave
than
he
who
thinks
himself
free
without
being
so
a
man
has
only
to
declare
himself
free
to
feel
at
the
same
moment
that
he
is
limited
should
he
venture
to
declare
himself
limited
he
feels
himself
free
against
the
great
superiority
of
another
there
is
no
remedy
but
love
it
is
a
terrible
thing
for
an
eminent
man
to
be
gloried
in
by
fools
it
is
said
that
no
man
is
a
hero
to
his
valet
that
is
only
because
a
hero
can
be
recognised
only
by
a
hero
the
valet
will
probably
know
how
to
appreciate
his
like
his
there
is
no
greater
consolation
for
mediocrity
than
that
the
genius
is
not
immortal
the
greatest
men
are
linked
to
their
age
by
some
weak
point
we
generally
take
men
to
be
more
dangerous
than
they
are
fools
and
wise
folk
are
alike
harmless
it
is
the
and
the
who
are
the
most
dangerous
to
see
a
difficult
thing
lightly
handled
gives
us
the
impression
of
the
impossible
difficulties
increase
the
nearer
we
come
to
our
aim
sowing
is
not
so
painful
as
reaping
we
are
fond
of
looking
to
the
future
because
our
secret
wishes
make
us
apt
to
turn
in
our
favour
the
uncertainties
which
move
about
in
it
hither
and
thither
it
is
not
easy
to
be
in
any
great
assembly
without
thinking
that
the
chance
which
brings
so
many
people
together
will
also
make
us
meet
our
friends
a
man
may
live
never
so
retired
a
life
but
he
becomes
a
debtor
or
a
creditor
before
he
is
aware
of
it
if
anyone
meets
us
who
owes
us
a
debt
of
gratitude
it
immediately
crosses
our
mind
how
often
can
we
meet
some
one
to
whom
we
owe
gratitude
without
thinking
of
it
to
communicate
oneself
is
nature
to
receive
a
communication
as
it
is
given
is
culture
no
one
would
speak
much
in
society
if
he
were
aware
how
often
we
misunderstand
others
it
is
only
because
we
have
not
understood
a
thing
that
we
can
not
repeat
it
without
alteration
to
make
a
long
speech
in
the
presence
of
others
without
flattering
your
audience
is
to
rouse
dislike
every
word
that
we
utter
rouses
its
contrary
contradiction
and
flattery
make
both
of
them
bad
conversation
the
pleasantest
society
is
that
in
which
there
exists
a
genial
deference
amongst
the
members
one
towards
another
by
nothing
do
men
show
their
character
more
than
by
the
things
they
laugh
at
the
ridiculous
springs
from
a
moral
contrast
innocently
presented
to
the
senses
the
sensual
man
often
laughs
when
there
is
nothing
to
laugh
at
whatever
it
is
that
moves
him
he
shows
that
he
is
pleased
with
himself
an
intelligent
man
finds
almost
everything
ridiculous
a
wise
man
hardly
anything
a
man
well
on
in
years
was
reproved
for
still
troubling
himself
about
young
women
is
the
only
means
he
replied
regaining
youth
and
that
is
something
every
one
wishes
to
do
a
man
does
not
mind
being
blamed
for
his
faults
and
being
punished
for
them
and
he
patiently
suffers
much
for
the
sake
of
them
but
he
becomes
impatient
if
he
is
required
to
give
them
up
certain
faults
are
necessary
to
the
individual
if
he
is
to
exist
we
should
not
like
old
friends
to
give
up
certain
peculiarities
it
is
said
of
a
man
that
he
will
soon
die
when
he
acts
in
any
way
unlike
himself
what
kind
of
faults
in
ourselves
should
we
retain
nay
even
cultivate
those
which
rather
flatter
other
people
than
offend
them
the
passions
are
good
or
bad
qualities
only
intensified
our
passions
are
in
truth
like
the
phoenix
when
the
old
one
burns
away
the
new
one
rises
out
of
its
ashes
at
once
great
passions
are
hopeless
diseases
that
which
could
cure
them
is
the
first
thing
to
make
them
really
dangerous
passion
is
enhanced
and
tempered
by
avowal
in
nothing
perhaps
is
the
middle
course
more
desirable
than
in
confidence
and
reticence
towards
those
we
love
to
sit
in
judgment
on
the
departed
is
never
likely
to
be
equitable
we
all
suffer
from
life
who
except
god
can
call
us
to
account
let
not
their
faults
and
sufferings
but
what
they
have
accomplished
and
done
occupy
the
survivors
it
is
failings
that
show
human
nature
and
merits
that
distinguish
the
individual
faults
and
misfortunes
we
all
have
in
common
virtues
belong
to
each
one
separately
vi
the
secret
places
in
the
way
of
life
may
not
and
can
not
be
revealed
there
are
rocks
of
offence
on
which
every
traveller
must
stumble
but
the
poet
points
to
where
they
are
it
would
not
be
worth
while
to
see
seventy
years
if
all
the
wisdom
of
this
world
were
foolishness
with
god
the
true
is
godlike
we
do
not
see
it
itself
we
must
guess
at
it
through
its
manifestations
the
real
scholar
learns
how
to
evolve
the
unknown
from
the
known
and
draws
near
the
master
in
the
smithy
the
iron
is
softened
by
blowing
up
the
fire
and
taking
the
dross
from
the
bar
as
soon
as
it
is
purified
it
is
beaten
and
pressed
and
becomes
firm
again
by
the
addition
of
fresh
water
the
same
thing
happens
to
a
man
at
the
hands
of
his
teacher
what
belongs
to
a
man
he
can
not
get
rid
of
even
though
he
throws
it
away
of
true
religions
there
are
only
two
one
of
them
recognises
and
worships
the
holy
that
without
form
or
shape
dwells
in
and
around
us
and
the
other
recognises
and
worships
it
in
its
fairest
form
everything
that
lies
between
these
two
is
idolatry
it
is
undeniable
that
in
the
reformation
the
human
mind
tried
to
free
itself
and
the
renaissance
of
greek
and
roman
antiquity
brought
about
the
wish
and
longing
for
a
freer
more
seemly
and
elegant
life
the
movement
was
favoured
in
no
small
degree
by
the
fact
that
men
hearts
aimed
at
returning
to
a
certain
simple
state
of
nature
while
the
imagination
sought
to
concentrate
itself
the
saints
were
all
at
once
driven
from
heaven
and
senses
thought
and
heart
were
turned
from
a
divine
mother
with
a
tender
child
to
the
grown
man
doing
good
and
suffering
evil
who
was
later
transfigured
into
a
being
in
its
nature
and
then
recognised
and
honoured
as
god
himself
he
stood
against
a
background
where
the
creator
had
opened
out
the
universe
a
spiritual
influence
went
out
from
him
his
sufferings
were
adopted
as
an
example
and
his
transfiguration
was
the
pledge
of
everlastingness
as
a
coal
is
revived
by
incense
so
prayer
revives
the
hopes
of
the
heart
from
a
strict
point
of
view
we
must
have
a
reformation
of
ourselves
every
day
and
protest
against
others
even
though
it
be
in
no
religious
sense
it
should
be
our
earnest
endeavour
to
use
words
coinciding
as
closely
as
possible
with
what
we
feel
see
think
experience
imagine
and
reason
it
is
an
endeavour
which
we
can
not
evade
and
which
is
daily
to
be
renewed
let
every
man
examine
himself
and
he
will
find
this
a
much
harder
task
than
he
might
suppose
for
unhappily
a
man
usually
takes
words
as
mere
his
knowledge
and
his
thought
are
in
most
cases
better
than
his
method
of
expression
false
irrelevant
and
futile
ideas
may
arise
in
ourselves
and
others
or
find
their
way
into
us
from
without
let
us
persist
in
the
effort
to
remove
them
as
far
as
we
can
by
plain
and
honest
purpose
as
we
grow
older
the
ordeals
grow
greater
where
i
can
not
be
moral
my
power
is
gone
a
man
is
not
deceived
by
others
he
deceives
himself
laws
are
all
made
by
old
people
and
by
men
youths
and
women
want
the
exceptions
old
people
the
rules
it
is
not
the
intelligent
man
who
rules
but
intelligence
not
the
wise
man
but
wisdom
to
praise
a
man
is
to
put
oneself
on
his
level
it
is
not
enough
to
know
we
must
also
apply
it
is
not
enough
to
will
we
must
also
do
chinese
indian
and
egyptian
antiquities
are
never
more
than
curiosities
it
is
well
to
make
acquaintance
with
them
but
in
point
of
moral
and
æsthetic
culture
they
can
help
us
little
the
german
runs
no
greater
danger
than
to
advance
with
and
by
the
example
of
his
neighbours
there
is
perhaps
no
nation
that
is
fitter
for
the
process
of
so
that
it
has
proved
of
the
greatest
advantage
to
germany
to
have
obtained
the
notice
of
the
world
so
late
even
men
of
insight
do
not
see
that
they
try
to
explain
things
which
lie
at
the
foundation
of
our
experience
and
in
which
we
must
simply
acquiesce
yet
still
the
attempt
may
have
its
advantage
as
otherwise
we
should
break
off
our
researches
too
soon
from
this
time
forward
if
a
man
does
not
apply
himself
to
some
art
or
handiwork
he
will
be
in
a
bad
way
in
the
rapid
changes
of
the
world
knowledge
is
no
longer
a
furtherance
by
the
time
a
man
has
taken
note
of
everything
he
has
lost
himself
besides
in
these
days
the
world
forces
universal
culture
upon
us
and
so
we
need
not
trouble
ourselves
further
about
it
we
must
appropriate
some
particular
culture
the
greatest
difficulties
lie
where
we
do
not
look
for
them
our
interest
in
public
events
is
mostly
the
merest
philistinism
nothing
is
more
highly
to
be
prized
than
the
value
of
each
day
qui
ante
nos
nostra
dixerunt
this
is
so
strange
an
utterance
that
it
could
only
have
come
from
one
who
fancied
himself
autochthonous
the
man
who
looks
upon
it
as
an
honour
to
be
descended
from
wise
ancestors
will
allow
them
at
least
as
much
as
he
allows
himself
strictly
speaking
everything
depends
upon
a
man
intentions
where
these
exist
thoughts
appear
and
as
the
intentions
are
so
are
the
thoughts
if
a
man
lives
long
in
a
high
position
he
does
not
it
is
true
experience
all
that
a
man
can
experience
but
he
experiences
things
like
them
and
perhaps
some
things
that
have
no
parallel
elsewhere
vii
the
first
and
last
thing
that
is
required
of
genius
is
love
of
truth
to
be
and
remain
true
to
oneself
and
others
is
to
possess
the
noblest
attribute
of
the
greatest
talents
great
talents
are
the
best
means
of
conciliation
the
action
of
genius
is
in
a
way
ubiquitous
towards
general
truths
before
experience
and
towards
particular
truths
after
it
an
active
scepticism
is
one
which
constantly
aims
at
overcoming
itself
and
arriving
by
means
of
regulated
experience
at
a
kind
of
conditioned
certainty
the
general
nature
of
the
sceptical
mind
is
its
tendency
to
inquire
whether
any
particular
predicate
really
attaches
to
any
particular
object
and
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry
is
safely
to
apply
in
practice
what
has
thus
been
discovered
and
proved
the
mind
endowed
with
active
powers
and
keeping
with
a
practical
object
to
the
task
that
lies
nearest
is
the
worthiest
there
is
on
earth
perfection
is
the
measure
of
heaven
and
the
wish
to
be
perfect
the
measure
of
man
not
only
what
is
born
with
him
but
also
what
he
acquires
makes
the
man
a
man
is
well
equipped
for
all
the
real
necessities
of
life
if
he
trusts
his
senses
and
so
cultivates
them
that
they
remain
worthy
of
being
trusted
the
senses
do
not
deceive
it
is
the
judgment
that
deceives
the
lower
animal
is
taught
by
its
organs
man
teaches
his
organs
and
dominates
them
all
direct
invitation
to
live
up
to
ideals
is
of
doubtful
value
particularly
if
addressed
to
women
whatever
the
reason
of
it
may
be
a
man
of
any
importance
collects
round
him
a
seraglio
of
a
more
or
less
religious
moral
and
æsthetic
character
when
a
great
idea
enters
the
world
as
a
gospel
it
becomes
an
offence
to
the
multitude
which
stagnates
in
pedantry
and
to
those
who
have
much
learning
but
little
depth
it
is
folly
every
idea
appears
at
first
as
a
strange
visitor
and
when
it
begins
to
be
realised
it
is
hardly
distinguishable
from
phantasy
and
phantastery
this
it
is
that
has
been
called
in
a
good
and
in
a
bad
sense
ideology
and
this
is
why
the
ideologist
is
so
repugnant
to
the
practical
man
of
every
day
you
may
recognise
the
utility
of
an
idea
and
yet
not
quite
understand
how
to
make
a
perfect
use
of
it
deum
that
is
a
fine
a
worthy
thing
to
say
but
to
recognise
god
where
and
as
he
reveals
himself
is
the
only
true
bliss
on
earth
kepler
said
wish
is
that
i
may
perceive
the
god
whom
i
find
everywhere
in
the
external
world
in
like
manner
also
within
and
inside
me
the
good
man
was
not
aware
that
in
that
very
moment
the
divine
in
him
stood
in
the
closest
connection
with
the
divine
in
the
universe
what
is
predestination
it
is
this
god
is
mightier
and
wiser
than
we
are
and
so
he
does
with
us
as
he
pleases
toleration
should
strictly
speaking
be
only
a
passing
mood
it
ought
to
lead
to
acknowledgment
and
appreciation
to
tolerate
a
person
is
to
affront
him

love
and

once
felt
in
a
quiet
sociable
hour
a
plastic
impulse
in

nature
they
worked
together
and
created
a
lovely
image
a
pandora
in
the
higher
sense
patience
stumbled
over
the
roots
of
the
tree
which
i
planted
it
must
have
been
an
old
forester
who
said
that
a
leaf
blown
by
the
wind
often
looks
like
a
bird
does
the
sparrow
know
how
the
stork
feels
lamps
make
and
candles
want
snuffing
it
is
only
the
light
of
heaven
that
shines
pure
and
leaves
no
stain
if
you
miss
the
first
you
will
not
succeed
in
buttoning
up
your
coat
a
burnt
child
dreads
the
fire
an
old
man
who
has
often
been
singed
is
afraid
of
warming
himself
it
is
not
worth
while
to
do
anything
for
the
world
that
we
have
with
us
as
the
existing
order
may
in
a
moment
pass
away
it
is
for
the
past
and
the
future
that
we
must
work
for
the
past
to
acknowledge
its
merits
for
the
future
to
try
to
increase
its
value
let
every
man
ask
himself
with
which
of
his
faculties
he
can
and
will
somehow
influence
his
age
let
no
one
think
that
people
have
waited
for
him
as
for
the
saviour
character
in
matters
great
and
small
consists
in
a
man
steadily
pursuing
the
things
of
which
he
feels
himself
capable
the
man
who
wants
to
be
active
and
has
to
be
so
need
only
think
of
what
is
fitting
at
the
moment
and
he
will
make
his
way
without
difficulty
this
is
where
women
have
the
advantage
if
they
understand
it
the
moment
is
a
kind
of
public
a
man
must
deceive
it
into
believing
that
he
is
doing
something
then
it
leaves
us
alone
to
go
our
way
in
secret
whereat
its
grandchildren
can
not
fail
to
be
astonished
there
are
men
who
put
their
knowledge
in
the
place
of
insight
in
some
states
as
a
consequence
of
the
violent
movements
experienced
in
almost
all
directions
there
has
come
about
a
certain
overpressure
in
the
system
of
education
the
harm
of
which
will
be
more
generally
felt
hereafter
though
even
now
it
is
perfectly
well
recognised
by
capable
and
honest
authorities
capable
men
live
in
a
sort
of
despair
over
the
fact
that
they
are
bound
by
the
rules
of
their
office
to
teach
and
communicate
things
which
they
look
upon
as
useless
and
hurtful
there
is
no
sadder
sight
than
the
direct
striving
after
the
unconditioned
in
this
thoroughly
conditioned
world
before
the
revolution
it
was
all
afterwards
it
all
changed
to
can
a
nation
become
ripe
that
is
a
strange
question
i
would
answer
yes
if
all
the
men
could
be
born
thirty
years
of
age
but
as
youth
will
always
be
too
forward
and
old
age
too
backward
the
really
mature
man
is
always
hemmed
in
between
them
and
has
to
resort
to
strange
devices
to
make
his
way
through
it
does
not
look
well
for
monarchs
to
speak
through
the
press
for
power
should
act
and
not
talk
the
projects
of
the
liberal
party
always
bear
being
read
the
man
who
is
overpowered
may
at
least
express
his
views
in
speech
because
he
can
not
act
when
mazarin
was
shown
some
satirical
songs
on
a
new
tax
them
sing
said
he
long
as
they
pay
vanity
is
a
desire
of
personal
glory
the
wish
to
be
appreciated
honoured
and
run
after
not
because
of
one
personal
qualities
merits
and
achievements
but
because
of
one
individual
existence
at
best
therefore
it
is
a
frivolous
beauty
whom
it
befits
the
most
important
matters
of
feeling
as
of
reason
of
experience
as
of
reflection
should
be
treated
of
only
by
word
of
mouth
the
spoken
word
at
once
dies
if
it
is
not
kept
alive
by
some
other
word
following
on
it
and
suited
to
the
hearer
observe
what
happens
in
social
converse
if
the
word
is
not
dead
when
it
reaches
the
hearer
he
murders
it
at
once
by
a
contradiction
a
stipulation
a
condition
a
digression
an
interruption
and
all
the
thousand
tricks
of
conversation
with
the
written
word
the
case
is
still
worse
no
one
cares
to
read
anything
to
which
he
is
not
already
to
some
extent
accustomed
he
demands
the
known
and
the
familiar
under
an
altered
form
still
the
written
word
has
this
advantage
that
it
lasts
and
can
await
the
time
when
it
is
allowed
to
take
effect
both
what
is
reasonable
and
what
is
unreasonable
have
to
undergo
the
like
contradiction
dialectic
is
the
culture
of
the
spirit
of
contradiction
which
is
given
to
man
that
he
may
learn
to
perceive
the
differences
between
things
with
those
who
are
really
of
like
disposition
with
himself
a
man
can
not
long
be
at
variance
he
will
always
come
to
an
agreement
again
with
those
who
are
really
of
adverse
disposition
he
may
in
vain
try
to
preserve
harmony
he
will
always
come
to
a
separation
again
opponents
fancy
they
refute
us
when
they
repeat
their
own
opinion
and
pay
no
attention
to
ours
people
who
contradict
and
dispute
should
now
and
then
remember
that
not
every
mode
of
speech
is
intelligible
to
every
one
every
man
hears
only
what
he
understands
i
am
quite
prepared
to
find
that
many
a
reader
will
disagree
with
me
but
when
he
has
a
thing
before
him
in
black
and
white
he
must
let
it
stand
another
reader
may
perhaps
take
up
the
very
same
copy
and
agree
with
me
the
truest
liberality
is
appreciation
for
the
strenuous
man
the
difficulty
is
to
recognise
the
merits
of
elder
contemporaries
and
not
let
himself
be
hindered
by
their
defects
some
men
think
about
the
defects
of
their
friends
and
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
by
it
i
have
always
paid
attention
to
the
merits
of
my
enemies
and
found
it
an
advantage
there
are
many
men
who
fancy
they
understand
whatever
they
experience
the
public
must
be
treated
like
women
they
must
be
told
absolutely
nothing
but
what
they
like
to
hear
every
age
of
man
has
a
certain
philosophy
answering
to
it
the
child
comes
out
as
a
realist
he
finds
himself
as
convinced
that
pears
and
apples
exist
as
that
he
himself
exists
the
youth
in
a
storm
of
inner
passion
is
forced
to
turn
his
gaze
within
and
feel
in
advance
what
he
is
going
to
be
he
is
changed
into
an
idealist
but
the
man
has
every
reason
to
become
a
sceptic
he
does
well
to
doubt
whether
the
means
he
has
chosen
to
his
end
are
the
right
ones
before
and
during
action
he
has
every
reason
for
keeping
his
understanding
mobile
that
he
may
not
afterwards
have
to
grieve
over
a
false
choice
yet
when
he
grows
old
he
will
always
confess
himself
a
mystic
he
sees
that
so
much
seems
to
depend
on
chance
that
folly
succeeds
and
wisdom
fails
that
good
and
evil
fortune
are
brought
unexpectedly
to
the
same
level
so
it
is
and
so
it
has
been
and
old
age
acquiesces
in
that
which
is
and
was
and
will
be
when
a
man
grows
old
he
must
consciously
remain
at
a
certain
stage
it
does
not
become
an
old
man
to
run
after
the
fashion
either
in
thought
or
in
dress
but
he
must
know
where
he
is
and
what
the
others
are
aiming
at
what
is
called
fashion
is
the
tradition
of
the
moment
all
tradition
carries
with
it
a
certain
necessity
for
people
to
put
themselves
on
a
level
with
it
we
have
long
been
busy
with
the
critique
of
reason
i
should
like
to
see
a
critique
of
it
would
be
a
real
benefit
to
mankind
if
we
could
convincingly
prove
to
the
ordinary
intelligence
how
far
it
can
go
and
that
is
just
as
much
as
it
fully
requires
for
life
on
this
earth
the
thinker
makes
a
great
mistake
when
he
asks
after
cause
and
effect
they
both
together
make
up
the
indivisible
phenomenon
all
practical
men
try
to
bring
the
world
under
their
hands
all
thinkers
under
their
heads
how
far
each
succeeds
they
may
both
see
for
themselves
shall
we
say
that
a
man
thinks
only
when
he
can
not
think
out
that
of
which
he
is
thinking
what
is
invention
or
discovery
it
is
the
conclusion
of
what
we
were
looking
for
it
is
with
history
as
with
nature
and
with
everything
of
any
depth
it
may
be
past
present
or
future
the
further
we
seriously
pursue
it
the
more
difficult
are
the
problems
that
appear
the
man
who
is
not
afraid
of
them
but
attacks
them
bravely
has
a
feeling
of
higher
culture
and
greater
ease
the
further
he
progresses
every
phenomenon
is
within
our
reach
if
we
treat
it
as
an
inclined
plane
which
is
of
easy
ascent
though
the
thick
end
of
the
wedge
may
be
steep
and
inaccessible
if
a
man
would
enter
upon
some
course
of
knowledge
he
must
either
be
deceived
or
deceive
himself
unless
external
necessity
irresistibly
determines
him
who
would
become
a
physician
if
at
one
and
the
same
time
he
saw
before
him
all
the
horrible
sights
that
await
him
how
many
years
must
a
man
do
nothing
before
he
can
at
all
know
what
is
to
be
done
and
how
to
do
it
duty
where
a
man
loves
what
he
commands
himself
to
do
literature
and
art
when
madame
roland
was
on
the
scaffold
she
asked
for
pen
and
paper
to
note
the
peculiar
thoughts
that
hovered
about
her
on
the
last
journey
it
is
a
pity
they
were
refused
for
in
a
tranquil
mind
thoughts
rise
up
at
the
close
of
life
hitherto
unthinkable
like
blessed
inward
voices
alighting
in
glory
on
the
summits
of
the
past
literature
is
a
fragment
of
fragments
the
least
of
what
happened
and
was
spoken
has
been
written
and
of
the
things
that
have
been
written
very
few
have
been
preserved
and
yet
with
all
the
fragmentary
nature
of
literature
we
find
thousand
fold
repetition
which
shows
how
limited
is
man
mind
and
destiny
excellent
work
is
unfathomable
approach
it
as
you
will
it
is
not
language
in
itself
which
is
correct
or
forcible
or
elegant
but
the
mind
that
is
embodied
in
it
and
so
it
is
not
for
a
man
to
determine
whether
he
will
give
his
calculations
or
speeches
or
poems
the
desired
qualities
the
question
is
whether
nature
has
given
him
the
intellectual
and
moral
qualities
which
fit
him
for
the
work
the
intellectual
power
of
observation
and
insight
the
moral
power
of
repelling
the
evil
spirits
that
might
hinder
him
from
paying
respect
to
truth
the
appeal
to
posterity
springs
from
the
pure
strong
feeling
of
the
existence
of
something
imperishable
something
that
even
though
it
be
not
at
once
recognised
will
in
the
end
be
gratified
by
finding
the
minority
turn
into
a
majority
when
a
new
literature
succeeds
it
obscures
the
effect
of
an
earlier
one
and
its
own
effect
predominates
so
that
it
is
well
from
time
to
time
to
look
back
what
is
original
in
us
is
best
preserved
and
quickened
if
we
do
not
lose
sight
of
those
who
have
gone
before
us
the
most
original
authors
of
modern
times
are
so
not
because
they
produce
what
is
new
but
only
because
they
are
able
to
say
things
the
like
of
which
seem
never
to
have
been
said
before
thus
the
best
sign
of
originality
lies
in
taking
up
a
subject
and
then
developing
it
so
fully
as
to
make
every
one
confess
that
he
would
hardly
have
found
so
much
in
it
there
are
many
thoughts
that
come
only
from
general
culture
like
buds
from
green
branches
when
roses
bloom
you
see
them
blooming
everywhere
lucidity
is
a
due
distribution
of
light
and
shade
a
man
who
has
no
acquaintance
with
foreign
languages
knows
nothing
of
his
own
we
must
remember
that
there
are
many
men
who
without
being
productive
are
anxious
to
say
something
important
and
the
results
are
most
curious
deep
and
earnest
thinkers
are
in
a
difficult
position
with
regard
to
the
public
some
books
seem
to
have
been
written
not
to
teach
us
anything
but
to
let
us
know
that
the
author
has
known
something
an
author
can
show
no
greater
respect
for
his
public
than
by
never
bringing
it
what
it
expects
but
what
he
himself
thinks
right
and
proper
in
that
stage
of
his
own
and
others
culture
in
which
for
the
time
he
finds
himself
the
are
men
of
active
talent
with
a
fresh
stimulus
and
reaction
from
an
stagnant
mannered
epoch
of
art
they
can
not
avoid
commonplace
productions
are
now
possible
which
without
being
bad
have
no
value
they
have
no
value
because
they
contain
nothing
and
they
are
not
bad
because
a
general
form
of
is
present
to
the
mind
all
lyrical
work
must
as
a
whole
be
perfectly
intelligible
but
in
some
particulars
a
little
unintelligible
a
romance
is
a
subjective
epic
in
which
the
author
begs
leave
to
treat
the
world
after
his
own
ideas
the
only
question
is
whether
he
has
any
ideas
the
rest
will
follow
of
itself
subjective
or
sentimental
poetry
has
now
been
admitted
to
an
equality
with
objective
and
descriptive
this
was
inevitable
because
otherwise
the
whole
of
modern
poetry
would
have
to
be
discarded
it
is
now
obvious
that
when
men
of
truly
poetical
genius
appear
they
will
describe
more
of
the
particular
feelings
of
the
inner
life
than
of
the
general
facts
of
the
great
life
of
the
world
this
has
already
taken
place
to
such
a
degree
that
we
have
a
poetry
without
figures
of
speech
which
can
by
no
means
be
refused
all
praise
superstition
is
the
poetry
of
life
and
so
it
does
not
hurt
the
poet
to
be
superstitious
that
glorious
hymn
creator
is
really
an
appeal
to
genius
that
is
why
it
speaks
so
powerfully
to
men
of
intellect
and
power
translators
are
like
busy
they
sing
the
praises
of
some
beauty
and
extol
her
charms
and
arouse
an
irresistible
longing
for
the
original
a
spinoza
in
poetry
becomes
a
machiavelli
in
philosophy
against
the
three
unities
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
if
the
subject
is
very
simple
but
there
are
times
when
thrice
three
unities
skilfully
interwoven
produce
a
very
pleasant
effect
the
sentimentality
of
the
english
is
humorous
and
tender
of
the
french
popular
and
pathetic
of
the
germans
naïve
and
realistic
mysticism
is
the
scholastic
of
the
heart
the
dialectic
of
the
feelings
if
a
man
sets
out
to
reproach
an
author
with
obscurity
he
should
first
of
all
examine
his
own
mind
to
see
if
he
is
himself
all
clearness
within
twilight
makes
even
plain
writing
illegible
it
is
with
books
as
with
new
acquaintances
at
first
we
are
highly
delighted
if
we
find
a
general
agreement
if
we
are
pleasantly
moved
on
any
of
the
chief
sides
of
our
existence
with
a
closer
acquaintance
differences
come
to
light
and
then
reasonable
conduct
mainly
consists
in
not
shrinking
back
at
once
as
may
happen
in
youth
but
in
keeping
firm
hold
of
the
things
in
which
we
agree
and
being
quite
clear
about
the
things
in
which
we
differ
without
on
that
account
desiring
any
union
in
psychological
reflection
the
greatest
difficulty
is
this
that
inner
and
outer
must
always
be
viewed
in
parallel
lines
or
rather
interwoven
it
is
a
continual
systole
and
diastole
an
inspiration
and
an
expiration
of
the
living
soul
if
this
can
not
be
put
into
words
it
should
be
carefully
marked
and
noted
my
relations
with
schiller
rested
on
the
decided
tendency
of
both
of
us
towards
a
single
aim
and
our
common
activity
rested
on
the
diversity
of
the
means
by
which
we
endeavoured
to
attain
that
aim
once
when
a
slight
difference
was
mentioned
between
us
of
which
i
was
reminded
by
a
passage
in
a
letter
of
his
i
made
the
following
reflections
there
is
a
great
difference
between
a
poet
seeking
the
particular
for
the
universal
and
seeing
the
universal
in
the
particular
the
one
gives
rise
to
allegory
where
the
particular
serves
only
as
instance
or
example
of
the
general
but
the
other
is
the
true
nature
of
poetry
namely
the
expression
of
the
particular
without
any
thought
of
or
reference
to
the
general
if
a
man
grasps
the
particular
vividly
he
also
grasps
the
general
without
being
aware
of
it
at
the
time
or
he
may
make
the
discovery
long
afterwards
there
may
be
eclectic
philosophers
but
not
an
eclectic
philosophy
but
every
one
is
an
eclectic
who
out
of
the
things
that
surround
and
take
place
about
him
appropriates
what
is
suited
to
his
nature
and
this
is
what
is
meant
by
culture
and
progress
in
matters
of
theory
or
practice
various
maxims
of
the
ancients
which
we
are
wont
to
repeat
again
and
again
had
a
meaning
quite
different
from
that
which
is
apt
to
attach
to
them
in
later
times
the
saying
that
no
one
who
is
unacquainted
with
or
a
stranger
to
geometry
should
enter
the
philosopher
school
does
not
mean
that
a
man
must
become
a
mathematician
to
attain
the
wisdom
of
the
world
geometry
is
here
taken
in
its
primary
elements
such
as
are
contained
in
euclid
and
laid
before
every
beginner
and
then
it
is
the
most
perfect
propædeutic
and
introduction
to
philosophy
when
a
boy
begins
to
understand
that
an
invisible
point
must
always
come
before
a
visible
one
and
that
the
shortest
way
between
two
points
is
a
straight
line
before
he
can
draw
it
on
his
paper
with
a
pencil
he
experiences
a
certain
pride
and
pleasure
and
he
is
not
wrong
for
he
has
the
source
of
all
thought
opened
to
him
idea
and
reality
et
are
become
clear
the
philosopher
has
no
new
discovery
to
bring
him
as
a
mathematician
he
has
found
the
basis
of
all
thought
for
himself
and
if
we
turn
to
that
significant
utterance
we
must
not
explain
it
in
an
ascetic
sense
it
is
in
nowise
the
of
our
modern
hypochondrists
humorists
and
it
simply
means
pay
some
attention
to
yourself
take
note
of
yourself
so
that
you
may
know
how
you
come
to
stand
towards
those
like
you
and
towards
the
world
this
involves
no
psychological
torture
every
capable
man
knows
and
feels
what
it
means
it
is
a
piece
of
good
advice
which
every
one
will
find
of
the
greatest
advantage
in
practice
let
us
remember
how
great
the
ancients
were
and
especially
how
the
socratic
school
holds
up
to
us
the
source
and
standard
of
all
life
and
action
and
bids
us
not
indulge
in
empty
speculation
but
live
and
do
so
long
as
our
scholastic
education
takes
us
back
to
antiquity
and
furthers
the
study
of
the
greek
and
latin
languages
we
may
congratulate
ourselves
that
these
studies
so
necessary
for
the
higher
culture
will
never
disappear
if
we
set
our
gaze
on
antiquity
and
earnestly
study
it
in
the
desire
to
form
ourselves
thereon
we
get
the
feeling
as
if
it
were
only
then
that
we
really
became
men
the
pedagogue
in
trying
to
write
and
speak
latin
has
a
higher
and
grander
idea
of
himself
than
would
be
permissible
in
ordinary
life
in
the
presence
of
antiquity
the
mind
that
is
susceptible
to
poetry
and
art
feels
itself
placed
in
the
most
pleasing
ideal
state
of
nature
and
even
to
this
day
the
homeric
hymns
have
the
power
of
freeing
us
at
any
rate
for
moments
from
the
frightful
burden
which
the
tradition
of
several
thousand
years
has
rolled
upon
us
there
is
no
such
thing
as
patriotic
art
and
patriotic
science
both
art
and
science
belong
like
all
things
great
and
good
to
the
whole
world
and
can
be
furthered
only
by
a
free
and
general
interchange
of
ideas
among
contemporaries
with
continual
reference
to
the
heritage
of
the
past
as
it
is
known
to
us
poetical
talent
is
given
to
peasant
as
well
as
to
knight
all
that
is
required
is
that
each
shall
grasp
his
position
and
treat
it
worthily
an
historic
sense
means
a
sense
so
cultured
that
in
valuing
the
deserts
and
merits
of
its
own
time
it
takes
account
also
of
the
past
the
best
that
history
gives
us
is
the
enthusiasm
it
arouses
the
historian
duty
is
twofold
first
towards
himself
then
towards
his
readers
as
regards
himself
he
must
carefully
examine
into
the
things
that
could
have
happened
and
for
the
reader
sake
he
must
determine
what
actually
did
happen
his
action
towards
himself
is
a
matter
between
himself
and
his
colleagues
but
the
public
must
not
see
into
the
secret
that
there
is
little
in
history
which
can
be
said
to
be
positively
determined
the
historian
duty
is
to
separate
the
true
from
the
false
the
certain
from
the
uncertain
and
the
doubtful
from
that
which
can
not
be
accepted
it
is
seldom
that
any
one
of
great
age
becomes
historical
to
himself
and
finds
his
contemporaries
become
historical
to
him
so
that
he
neither
cares
nor
is
able
to
argue
with
any
one
on
a
closer
examination
of
the
matter
it
will
be
found
that
the
historian
does
not
easily
grasp
history
as
something
historical
in
whatever
age
he
may
live
the
historian
always
writes
as
though
he
himself
had
been
present
at
the
time
of
which
he
treats
instead
of
simply
narrating
the
facts
and
movements
of
that
time
even
the
mere
chronicler
only
points
more
or
less
to
his
own
limitations
or
the
peculiarities
of
his
town
or
monastery
or
age
we
really
learn
only
from
those
books
which
we
can
not
criticise
the
author
of
a
book
which
we
could
criticise
would
have
to
learn
from
us
that
is
the
reason
why
the
bible
will
never
lose
its
power
because
as
long
as
the
world
lasts
no
one
can
stand
up
and
say
i
grasp
it
as
a
whole
and
understand
all
the
parts
of
it
but
we
say
humbly
as
a
whole
it
is
worthy
of
respect
and
in
all
its
parts
it
is
applicable
there
is
and
will
be
much
discussion
as
to
the
use
and
harm
of
circulating
the
bible
one
thing
is
clear
to
me
mischief
will
result
as
heretofore
by
using
it
phantastically
as
a
system
of
dogma
benefit
as
heretofore
by
a
loving
acceptance
of
its
teachings
i
am
convinced
that
the
bible
will
always
be
more
beautiful
the
more
it
is
understood
the
more
that
is
we
see
and
observe
that
every
word
which
we
take
in
a
general
sense
and
apply
specially
to
ourselves
had
under
certain
circumstances
of
time
and
place
a
peculiar
special
and
directly
individual
reference
the
incurable
evil
of
religious
controversy
is
that
while
one
party
wants
to
connect
the
highest
interest
of
humanity
with
fables
and
phrases
the
other
tries
to
rest
it
on
things
that
satisfy
no
one
if
one
has
not
read
the
newspapers
for
some
months
and
then
reads
them
all
together
one
sees
as
one
never
saw
before
how
much
time
is
wasted
with
this
kind
of
literature
the
classical
is
health
and
the
romantic
disease
ovid
remained
classical
even
in
exile
it
is
not
in
himself
that
he
sees
misfortune
but
in
his
banishment
from
the
metropolis
of
the
world
the
romantic
is
already
fallen
into
its
own
abysm
it
is
hard
to
imagine
anything
more
degraded
than
the
worst
of
the
new
productions
bodies
which
rot
while
they
are
still
alive
and
are
edified
by
the
detailed
contemplation
of
their
own
decay
dead
men
who
remain
in
the
world
for
the
ruin
of
others
and
feed
their
death
on
the
living
to
this
have
come
our
makers
of
literature
when
the
same
thing
happened
in
antiquity
it
was
only
as
a
strange
token
of
some
rare
disease
but
with
the
moderns
the
disease
has
become
endemic
and
epidemic
literature
decays
only
as
men
become
more
and
more
corrupt
what
a
day
it
is
when
we
must
envy
the
men
in
their
graves
the
things
that
are
true
good
excellent
are
simple
and
always
alike
whatever
their
appearance
may
be
but
the
error
that
we
blame
is
extremely
manifold
and
varying
it
is
in
conflict
not
only
with
the
good
and
the
true
but
also
with
itself
it
is
thus
it
is
that
the
words
of
blame
in
our
literature
must
necessarily
outnumber
the
words
of
praise
the
greeks
whose
poetry
and
rhetoric
was
of
a
simple
and
positive
character
express
approval
more
often
than
disapproval
with
the
latin
writers
it
is
the
contrary
and
the
more
poetry
and
the
arts
of
speech
decay
the
more
will
blame
swell
and
praise
shrink
are
tragedies
but
the
versified
passions
of
people
who
make
heaven
knows
what
out
of
the
external
world
there
are
certain
empirical
enthusiasts
who
are
quite
right
in
showing
their
enthusiasm
over
new
productions
that
are
good
but
they
are
as
ecstatic
as
if
there
were
no
other
good
work
in
the
world
at
all
in
the
poet
appears
in
his
highest
function
as
the
representative
of
the
most
natural
condition
of
things
the
finest
mode
of
life
the
purest
moral
endeavour
the
worthiest
majesty
and
the
most
solemn
worship
he
ventures
on
common
and
ridiculous
contrasts
shakespeare
if
everything
were
lost
that
has
ever
been
preserved
to
us
of
this
kind
of
writing
the
arts
of
poetry
and
rhetoric
could
be
completely
restored
out
of
this
one
play
shakespeare
finest
dramas
are
wanting
here
and
there
in
facility
they
are
something
more
than
they
should
be
and
for
that
very
reason
indicate
the
great
poet
shakespeare
is
dangerous
reading
for
budding
talents
he
compels
them
to
reproduce
him
and
they
fancy
they
are
producing
themselves
yorick
sterne
was
the
finest
spirit
that
ever
worked
to
read
him
is
to
attain
a
fine
feeling
of
freedom
his
humour
is
inimitable
and
it
is
not
every
kind
of
humour
that
frees
the
soul
the
peculiar
value
of
popular
ballads
is
that
their
motives
are
drawn
direct
from
nature
this
however
is
an
advantage
of
which
the
poet
of
culture
could
also
avail
himself
if
he
knew
how
to
do
it
but
in
popular
ballads
there
is
always
this
advantage
that
in
the
art
of
saying
things
shortly
uneducated
men
are
always
better
skilled
than
those
who
are
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
educated
the
translator
must
proceed
until
he
reaches
the
untranslatable
and
then
only
will
he
have
an
idea
of
the
foreign
nation
and
the
foreign
tongue
when
we
say
of
a
landscape
that
it
has
a
romantic
character
it
is
the
secret
feeling
of
the
sublime
taking
the
form
of
the
past
or
what
is
the
same
thing
of
solitude
absence
or
seclusion
the
beautiful
is
a
manifestation
of
secret
laws
of
nature
which
without
its
presence
would
never
have
been
revealed
it
is
said
artist
study
nature
but
it
is
no
trifle
to
develop
the
noble
out
of
the
commonplace
or
beauty
out
of
uniformity
when
nature
begins
to
reveal
her
open
secret
to
a
man
he
feels
an
irresistible
longing
for
her
worthiest
interpreter
art
for
all
other
arts
we
must
make
some
allowance
but
to
greek
art
alone
we
are
always
debtors
there
is
no
surer
way
of
evading
the
world
than
by
art
and
no
surer
way
of
uniting
with
it
than
by
art
even
in
the
moments
of
highest
happiness
and
deepest
misery
we
need
the
artist
false
tendencies
of
the
senses
are
a
kind
of
desire
after
realism
always
better
than
that
false
tendency
which
expresses
itself
as
idealistic
longing
the
dignity
of
art
appears
perhaps
most
conspicuously
in
music
for
in
music
there
is
no
material
to
be
deducted
it
is
wholly
form
and
intrinsic
value
and
it
raises
and
ennobles
all
that
it
expresses
it
is
only
by
art
and
especially
by
poetry
that
the
imagination
is
regulated
nothing
is
more
frightful
than
imagination
without
taste
if
we
were
to
despise
art
on
the
ground
that
it
is
an
imitation
of
nature
it
might
be
answered
that
nature
also
imitates
much
else
further
that
art
does
not
exactly
imitate
that
which
can
be
seen
by
the
eyes
but
goes
back
to
that
element
of
reason
of
which
nature
consists
and
according
to
which
nature
acts
further
the
arts
also
produce
much
out
of
themselves
and
on
the
other
hand
add
much
where
nature
fails
in
perfection
in
that
they
possess
beauty
in
themselves
so
it
was
that
pheidias
could
sculpture
a
god
although
he
had
nothing
that
could
be
seen
by
the
eye
to
imitate
but
grasped
the
appearance
which
zeus
himself
would
have
if
he
were
to
come
before
our
eyes
art
rests
upon
a
kind
of
religious
sense
it
is
deeply
and
ineradicably
in
earnest
thus
it
is
that
art
so
willingly
goes
hand
in
hand
with
religion
a
noble
philosopher
spoke
of
architecture
as
and
it
was
inevitable
that
many
people
should
shake
their
heads
over
his
remark
we
believe
that
no
better
repetition
of
this
fine
thought
can
be
given
than
by
calling
architecture
a
art
is
essentially
noble
therefore
the
artist
has
nothing
to
fear
from
a
low
or
common
subject
nay
by
taking
it
up
he
ennobles
it
and
so
it
is
that
we
see
the
greatest
artists
boldly
exercising
their
sovereign
rights
in
every
artist
there
is
a
germ
of
daring
without
which
no
talent
is
conceivable
all
the
artists
who
are
already
known
to
me
from
so
many
sides
i
propose
to
consider
exclusively
from
the
ethical
side
to
explain
from
the
and
method
of
their
work
the
part
played
therein
by
time
and
place
nation
and
master
and
their
own
indestructible
personality
to
mould
them
to
what
they
became
and
to
preserve
them
in
what
they
were
art
is
a
medium
of
what
no
tongue
can
utter
and
thus
it
seems
a
piece
of
folly
to
try
to
convey
its
meaning
afresh
by
means
of
words
but
by
trying
to
do
so
the
understanding
gains
and
this
again
benefits
the
faculty
in
practice
an
artist
who
produces
valuable
work
is
not
always
able
to
give
an
account
of
his
own
or
others
performances
we
know
of
no
world
except
in
relation
to
mankind
and
we
wish
for
no
art
that
does
not
bear
the
mark
of
this
relation
higher
aims
are
in
themselves
more
valuable
even
if
unfulfilled
than
lower
ones
quite
attained
blunt
naïvety
stubborn
vigour
scrupulous
observance
of
rule
and
any
other
epithets
which
may
apply
to
older
german
art
are
a
part
of
every
earlier
and
simpler
artistic
method
the
older
venetians
florentines
and
others
had
it
all
too
because
albrecht
dürer
with
his
incomparable
talent
could
never
rise
to
the
idea
of
the
symmetry
of
beauty
or
even
to
the
thought
of
a
fitting
conformity
to
the
object
in
view
are
we
never
to
spurn
the
ground
albrecht
dürer
had
the
advantage
of
a
very
profound
realistic
perception
an
affectionate
human
sympathy
with
all
present
conditions
he
was
kept
back
by
a
gloomy
phantasy
devoid
both
of
form
and
foundation
it
would
be
interesting
to
show
how
martin
schön
stands
near
him
and
how
the
merits
of
german
art
were
restricted
to
these
two
and
useful
also
to
show
that
it
was
not
evening
every
day
in
every
italian
school
the
butterfly
breaks
loose
from
the
chrysalis
after
klopstock
released
us
from
rhyme
and
voss
gave
us
models
of
prose
are
we
to
make
doggerel
again
like
hans
sachs
let
us
be
turnips
are
good
but
they
are
best
mixed
with
chestnuts
and
these
two
noble
products
of
the
earth
grow
far
apart
in
every
kind
of
art
there
is
a
degree
of
excellence
which
may
be
reached
so
to
speak
by
the
mere
use
of
one
own
natural
talents
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
impossible
to
go
beyond
that
point
unless
art
comes
to
one
aid
in
the
presence
of
nature
even
moderate
talent
is
always
possessed
of
insight
hence
drawings
from
nature
that
are
at
all
carefully
done
always
give
pleasure
to
make
many
sketches
issue
at
last
in
a
complete
work
is
something
that
not
even
the
best
artists
always
achieve
in
the
sphere
of
true
art
there
is
no
preparatory
school
but
there
is
a
way
of
preparation
and
the
best
preparation
is
the
interest
of
the
most
insignificant
pupil
in
the
work
of
the
master
have
often
made
excellent
painters
if
an
artist
grasps
nature
aright
and
contrives
to
give
its
form
a
nobler
freer
grace
no
one
will
understand
the
source
of
his
inspiration
and
every
one
will
swear
that
he
has
taken
it
from
the
antique
in
studying
the
human
form
let
the
painter
reject
what
is
exaggerated
false
and
mechanical
but
let
him
learn
to
grasp
of
what
infinite
grace
the
human
body
is
capable
kant
taught
us
the
critique
of
the
reason
we
must
have
a
critique
of
the
senses
if
art
in
general
and
especially
german
art
is
ever
to
regain
its
tone
and
move
forward
on
the
path
of
life
and
happiness
science
in
the
sphere
of
natural
science
let
us
remember
that
we
have
always
to
deal
with
an
insoluble
problem
let
us
prove
keen
and
honest
in
attending
to
anything
which
is
in
any
way
brought
to
our
notice
most
of
all
when
it
does
not
fit
in
with
our
previous
ideas
for
it
is
only
thereby
that
we
perceive
the
problem
which
does
indeed
lie
in
nature
but
still
more
in
man
a
man
can
not
well
stand
by
himself
and
so
he
is
glad
to
join
a
party
because
if
he
does
not
find
rest
there
he
at
any
rate
finds
quiet
and
safety
it
is
a
misfortune
to
pass
at
once
from
observation
to
conclusion
and
to
regard
both
as
of
equal
value
but
it
befalls
many
a
student
in
the
history
of
science
and
throughout
the
whole
course
of
its
progress
we
see
certain
epochs
following
one
another
more
or
less
rapidly
some
important
view
is
expressed
it
may
be
original
or
only
revived
sooner
or
later
it
receives
recognition
fellow
workers
spring
up
the
outcome
of
it
finds
its
way
into
the
schools
it
is
taught
and
handed
down
and
we
observe
unhappily
that
it
does
not
in
the
least
matter
whether
the
view
be
true
or
false
in
either
case
its
course
is
the
same
in
either
case
it
comes
in
the
end
to
be
a
mere
phrase
a
lifeless
word
stamped
on
the
memory
first
let
a
man
teach
himself
and
then
he
will
be
taught
by
others
theories
are
usually
the
efforts
of
an
impatient
understanding
that
would
gladly
be
rid
of
phenomena
and
so
puts
in
their
place
pictures
notions
nay
often
mere
words
we
may
surmise
or
even
see
quite
well
that
such
theories
are
but
do
not
passion
and
love
a
at
all
times
and
rightly
too
because
they
stand
in
so
much
need
of
it
it
is
difficult
to
know
how
to
treat
the
errors
of
the
age
if
a
man
oppose
them
he
stands
alone
if
he
surrender
to
them
they
bring
him
neither
joy
nor
credit
there
are
some
hundred
christian
sects
every
one
of
them
acknowledging
god
and
the
lord
in
its
own
way
without
troubling
themselves
further
about
one
another
in
the
study
of
nature
nay
in
every
study
things
must
of
necessity
come
to
the
same
pass
for
what
is
the
meaning
of
every
one
speaking
of
toleration
and
trying
to
prevent
others
from
thinking
and
expressing
themselves
after
their
own
fashion
to
communicate
knowledge
by
means
of
analogy
appears
to
me
a
process
equally
useful
and
pleasant
the
analogous
case
is
not
there
to
force
itself
on
the
attention
or
prove
anything
it
offers
a
comparison
with
some
other
case
but
is
not
in
union
with
it
several
analogous
cases
do
not
join
to
form
a
seried
row
they
are
like
good
society
which
always
suggests
more
than
it
grants
to
err
is
to
be
as
though
truth
did
not
exist
to
lay
bare
the
error
to
oneself
and
others
is
retrospective
discovery
with
the
growth
of
knowledge
our
ideas
must
from
time
to
time
be
organised
afresh
the
change
takes
place
usually
in
accordance
with
new
maxims
as
they
arise
but
it
always
remains
provisional
when
we
find
facts
within
our
knowledge
exhibited
by
some
new
method
or
even
it
may
be
described
in
a
foreign
language
they
receive
a
peculiar
charm
of
novelty
and
wear
a
fresh
air
if
two
masters
of
the
same
art
differ
in
their
statement
of
it
in
all
likelihood
the
insoluble
problem
lies
midway
between
them
the
orbits
of
certainties
touch
one
another
but
in
the
interstices
there
is
room
enough
for
error
to
go
forth
and
prevail
we
more
readily
confess
to
errors
mistakes
and
shortcomings
in
our
conduct
than
in
our
thought
and
the
reason
of
it
is
that
the
conscience
is
humble
and
even
takes
a
pleasure
in
being
ashamed
but
the
intellect
is
proud
and
if
forced
to
recant
is
driven
to
despair
this
also
explains
how
it
is
that
truths
which
have
been
recognised
are
at
first
tacitly
admitted
and
then
gradually
spread
so
that
the
very
thing
which
was
obstinately
denied
appears
at
last
as
something
quite
natural
ignorant
people
raise
questions
which
were
answered
by
the
wise
thousands
of
years
ago
when
a
man
sees
a
phenomenon
before
him
his
thoughts
often
range
beyond
it
when
he
hears
it
only
talked
about
he
has
no
thoughts
at
all
authority
man
can
not
exist
without
it
and
yet
it
brings
in
its
train
just
as
much
of
error
as
of
truth
it
perpetuates
one
by
one
things
which
should
pass
away
one
by
one
it
rejects
that
which
should
be
preserved
and
allows
it
to
pass
away
and
it
is
chiefly
to
blame
for
mankind
want
of
progress
authority
the
fact
namely
that
something
has
already
happened
or
been
said
or
decided
is
of
great
value
but
it
is
only
a
pedant
who
demands
authority
for
everything
an
old
foundation
is
worthy
of
all
respect
but
it
must
not
take
from
us
the
right
to
build
afresh
wherever
we
will
our
advice
is
that
every
man
should
remain
in
the
path
he
has
struck
out
for
himself
and
refuse
to
be
overawed
by
authority
hampered
by
prevalent
opinion
or
carried
away
by
fashion
the
various
branches
of
knowledge
always
tend
as
a
whole
to
stray
away
from
life
and
return
thither
only
by
a
roundabout
way
for
they
are
in
truth
of
life
they
gather
outer
and
inner
experiences
into
a
general
and
connected
whole
an
important
fact
an
ingenious
occupies
a
very
great
number
of
men
at
first
only
to
make
acquaintance
with
it
then
to
understand
it
and
afterwards
to
work
it
out
and
carry
it
further
on
the
appearance
of
anything
new
the
mass
of
people
ask
what
is
the
use
of
it
and
they
are
not
wrong
for
it
is
only
through
the
use
of
anything
that
they
can
perceive
its
value
the
truly
wise
ask
what
the
thing
is
in
itself
and
in
relation
to
other
things
and
do
not
trouble
themselves
about
the
use
of
it
in
other
words
about
the
way
in
which
it
may
be
applied
to
the
necessities
of
existence
and
what
is
already
known
this
will
soon
be
discovered
by
minds
of
a
very
different
order
minds
that
feel
the
joy
of
living
and
are
keen
adroit
and
practical
every
investigator
must
before
all
things
look
upon
himself
as
one
who
is
summoned
to
serve
on
a
jury
he
has
only
to
consider
how
far
the
statement
of
the
case
is
complete
and
clearly
set
forth
by
the
evidence
then
he
draws
his
conclusion
and
gives
his
vote
whether
it
be
that
his
opinion
coincides
with
that
of
the
foreman
or
not
and
in
acting
thus
he
remains
equally
at
ease
whether
the
majority
agree
with
him
or
he
finds
himself
in
a
minority
for
he
has
done
what
he
could
he
has
expressed
his
convictions
and
he
is
not
master
of
the
minds
or
hearts
of
others
in
the
world
of
science
however
these
sentiments
have
never
been
of
much
account
there
everything
depends
on
making
opinion
prevail
and
dominate
few
men
are
really
independent
the
majority
draws
the
individual
after
it
the
history
of
philosophy
of
science
of
religion
all
shows
that
opinions
spread
in
masses
but
that
that
always
comes
to
the
front
which
is
more
easily
grasped
that
is
to
say
is
most
suited
and
agreeable
to
the
human
mind
in
its
ordinary
condition
nay
he
who
has
practised
in
the
higher
sense
may
always
reckon
upon
meeting
an
adverse
majority
there
is
much
that
is
true
which
does
not
admit
of
being
calculated
just
as
there
are
a
great
many
things
that
can
not
be
brought
to
the
test
of
a
decisive
experiment
it
is
just
for
this
that
man
stands
so
high
that
what
could
not
otherwise
be
brought
to
light
should
be
brought
to
light
in
him
what
is
a
musical
string
and
all
its
mechanical
division
in
comparison
with
the
musician
ear
may
we
not
also
say
what
are
the
elementary
phenomena
of
nature
itself
compared
with
man
who
must
control
and
modify
them
all
before
he
can
in
any
way
assimilate
them
to
himself
to
a
new
truth
there
is
nothing
more
hurtful
than
an
old
error
the
ultimate
origin
of
things
is
completely
beyond
our
faculties
hence
when
we
see
anything
come
into
being
we
look
upon
it
as
having
been
already
there
this
is
why
we
find
the
theory
of
intelligible
there
are
many
problems
in
natural
science
on
which
we
can
not
fittingly
speak
unless
we
call
metaphysics
to
our
aid
but
not
the
wisdom
of
the
schools
which
consists
in
mere
verbiage
it
is
that
which
was
before
physics
exists
with
it
and
will
be
after
it
since
men
are
really
interested
in
nothing
but
their
own
opinions
every
one
who
puts
forward
an
opinion
looks
about
him
right
and
left
for
means
of
strengthening
himself
and
others
in
it
a
man
avails
himself
of
the
truth
so
long
as
it
is
serviceable
but
he
seizes
on
what
is
false
with
a
passionate
eloquence
as
soon
as
he
can
make
a
momentary
use
of
it
whether
it
be
to
dazzle
others
with
it
as
a
kind
of
or
to
employ
it
as
a
stopgap
for
effecting
an
apparent
union
between
things
that
have
been
disjointed
this
experience
at
first
caused
me
annoyance
and
then
sorrow
and
now
it
is
a
source
of
mischievous
satisfaction
i
have
pledged
myself
never
again
to
expose
a
proceeding
of
this
kind
everything
that
we
call
invention
or
discovery
in
the
higher
sense
of
the
word
is
the
serious
exercise
and
activity
of
an
original
feeling
for
truth
which
after
a
long
course
of
silent
cultivation
suddenly
flashes
out
into
fruitful
knowledge
it
is
a
revelation
working
from
within
on
the
outer
world
and
lets
a
man
feel
that
he
is
made
in
the
image
of
god
it
is
a
synthesis
of
world
and
mind
giving
the
most
blessed
assurance
of
the
eternal
harmony
of
things
a
man
must
cling
to
the
belief
that
the
incomprehensible
is
comprehensible
otherwise
he
would
not
try
to
fathom
it
there
are
pedants
who
are
also
rascals
and
they
are
the
worst
of
all
a
man
does
not
need
to
have
seen
or
experienced
everything
himself
but
if
he
is
to
commit
himself
to
another
experiences
and
his
way
of
putting
them
let
him
consider
that
he
has
to
do
with
three
things
the
object
in
question
and
two
subjects
the
supreme
achievement
would
be
to
see
that
stating
a
fact
is
starting
a
theory
if
i
acquiesce
at
last
in
some
ultimate
fact
of
nature
it
is
no
doubt
only
resignation
but
it
makes
a
great
difference
whether
the
resignation
takes
place
at
the
limits
of
human
faculty
or
within
the
hypothetical
boundaries
of
my
own
narrow
individuality
if
we
look
at
the
problems
raised
by
aristotle
we
are
astonished
at
his
gift
of
observation
what
wonderful
eyes
the
greeks
had
for
many
things
only
they
committed
the
mistake
of
being
of
passing
straightway
from
the
phenomenon
to
the
explanation
of
it
and
thereby
produced
certain
theories
that
are
quite
inadequate
but
this
is
the
mistake
of
all
times
and
still
made
in
our
own
day
hypotheses
are
by
which
the
teacher
lulls
his
scholars
to
sleep
the
thoughtful
and
honest
observer
is
always
learning
more
and
more
of
his
limitations
he
sees
that
the
further
knowledge
spreads
the
more
numerous
are
the
problems
that
make
their
appearance
our
mistake
is
that
we
doubt
what
is
certain
and
want
to
establish
what
is
uncertain
my
maxim
in
the
study
of
nature
is
this
hold
fast
what
is
certain
and
keep
a
watch
on
what
is
uncertain
what
a
master
a
man
would
be
in
his
own
subject
if
he
taught
nothing
useless
the
greatest
piece
of
folly
is
that
every
man
thinks
himself
compelled
to
hand
down
what
people
think
they
have
known
if
many
a
man
did
not
feel
obliged
to
repeat
what
is
untrue
because
he
has
said
it
once
the
world
would
have
been
quite
different
every
man
looks
at
the
world
lying
ready
before
him
ordered
and
fashioned
into
a
complete
whole
as
after
all
but
an
element
out
of
which
his
endeavour
is
to
create
a
special
world
suited
to
himself
capable
men
lay
hold
of
the
world
without
hesitation
and
try
to
shape
their
course
as
best
they
can
others
dally
over
it
and
some
doubt
even
of
their
own
existence
the
man
who
felt
the
full
force
of
this
fundamental
truth
would
dispute
with
no
one
but
look
upon
another
mode
of
thought
equally
with
his
own
as
merely
a
phenomenon
for
we
find
almost
daily
that
one
man
can
think
with
ease
what
another
can
not
possibly
think
at
all
and
that
too
not
in
matters
which
might
have
some
sort
of
effect
upon
their
common
weal
or
woe
but
in
things
which
can
not
touch
them
at
all
there
is
nothing
more
odious
than
the
majority
it
consists
of
a
few
powerful
men
to
lead
the
way
of
accommodating
rascals
and
submissive
weaklings
and
of
a
mass
of
men
who
trot
after
them
without
in
the
least
knowing
their
own
mind
when
i
observe
the
luminous
progress
and
expansion
of
natural
science
in
modern
times
i
seem
to
myself
like
a
traveller
going
eastwards
at
dawn
and
gazing
at
the
growing
light
with
joy
but
also
with
impatience
looking
forward
with
longing
to
the
advent
of
the
full
and
final
light
but
nevertheless
having
to
turn
away
his
eyes
when
the
sun
appeared
unable
to
bear
the
splendour
he
had
awaited
with
so
much
desire
we
praise
the
eighteenth
century
for
concerning
itself
chiefly
with
analysis
the
task
remaining
to
the
nineteenth
is
to
discover
the
false
syntheses
which
prevail
and
to
analyse
their
contents
anew
a
school
may
be
regarded
as
a
single
individual
who
talks
to
himself
for
a
hundred
years
and
takes
an
extraordinary
pleasure
in
his
own
being
however
foolish
and
silly
it
may
be
in
science
it
is
a
service
of
the
highest
merit
to
seek
out
those
fragmentary
truths
attained
by
the
ancients
and
to
develop
them
further
if
a
man
devotes
himself
to
the
promotion
of
science
he
is
firstly
opposed
and
then
he
is
informed
that
his
ground
is
already
occupied
at
first
men
will
allow
no
value
to
what
we
tell
them
and
then
they
behave
as
if
they
knew
it
all
themselves
nature
fills
all
space
with
her
limitless
productivity
if
we
observe
merely
our
own
earth
everything
that
we
call
evil
and
unfortunate
is
so
because
nature
can
not
provide
room
for
everything
that
comes
into
existence
and
still
less
endow
it
with
permanence
everything
that
comes
into
being
seeks
room
for
itself
and
desires
duration
hence
it
drives
something
else
from
its
place
and
shortens
its
duration
there
is
so
much
of
cryptogamy
in
phanerogamy
that
centuries
will
not
decipher
it
what
a
true
saying
it
is
that
he
who
wants
to
deceive
mankind
must
before
all
things
make
absurdity
plausible
the
further
knowledge
advances
the
nearer
we
come
to
the
unfathomable
the
more
we
know
how
to
use
our
knowledge
the
better
we
see
that
the
unfathomable
is
of
no
practical
use
the
finest
achievement
for
a
man
of
thought
is
to
have
fathomed
what
may
be
fathomed
and
quietly
to
revere
the
unfathomable
the
discerning
man
who
acknowledges
his
limitations
is
not
far
off
perfection
there
are
two
things
of
which
a
man
can
not
be
careful
enough
of
obstinacy
if
he
confines
himself
to
his
own
line
of
thought
of
incompetency
if
he
goes
beyond
it
incompetency
is
a
greater
obstacle
to
perfection
than
one
would
think
the
century
advances
but
every
individual
begins
anew
what
friends
do
with
us
and
for
us
is
a
real
part
of
our
life
for
it
strengthens
and
advances
our
personality
the
assault
of
our
enemies
is
not
part
of
our
life
it
is
only
part
of
our
experience
we
throw
it
off
and
guard
ourselves
against
it
as
against
frost
storm
rain
hail
or
any
other
of
the
external
evils
which
may
be
expected
to
happen
a
man
can
not
live
with
every
one
and
therefore
he
can
not
live
for
every
one
to
see
this
truth
aright
is
to
place
a
high
value
upon
friends
and
not
to
hate
or
persecute
one
enemies
nay
there
is
hardly
any
greater
advantage
for
a
man
to
gain
than
to
find
out
if
he
can
the
merits
of
his
opponents
it
gives
him
a
decided
ascendency
over
them
every
one
knows
how
to
value
what
he
has
attained
in
life
most
of
all
the
man
who
thinks
and
reflects
in
his
old
age
he
has
a
comfortable
feeling
that
it
is
something
of
which
no
one
can
rob
him
the
best
metempsychosis
is
for
us
to
appear
again
in
others
it
is
very
seldom
that
we
satisfy
ourselves
all
the
more
consoling
is
it
to
have
satisfied
others
we
look
back
upon
our
life
only
as
on
a
thing
of
broken
pieces
because
our
misses
and
failures
are
always
the
first
to
strike
us
and
outweigh
in
our
imagination
what
we
have
done
and
attained
the
sympathetic
youth
sees
nothing
of
this
he
reads
enjoys
and
uses
the
youth
of
one
who
has
gone
before
him
and
rejoices
in
it
with
all
his
heart
as
though
he
had
once
been
what
he
now
is
science
helps
us
before
all
things
in
this
that
it
somewhat
lightens
the
feeling
of
wonder
with
which
nature
fills
us
then
however
as
life
becomes
more
and
more
complex
it
creates
new
facilities
for
the
avoidance
of
what
would
do
us
harm
and
the
promotion
of
what
will
do
us
good
it
is
always
our
eyes
alone
our
way
of
looking
at
things
nature
alone
knows
what
she
means
now
and
what
she
had
meant
in
the
past
nature
aphorisms
nature
we
are
surrounded
by
her
and
locked
in
her
clasp
powerless
to
leave
her
and
powerless
to
come
closer
to
her
unasked
and
unwarned
she
takes
us
up
into
the
whirl
of
her
dance
and
hurries
on
with
us
till
we
are
weary
and
fall
from
her
arms
she
creates
new
forms
without
end
what
exists
now
never
was
before
what
was
comes
not
again
all
is
new
and
yet
always
the
old
we
live
in
the
midst
of
her
and
are
strangers
she
speaks
to
us
unceasingly
and
betrays
not
her
secret
we
are
always
influencing
her
and
yet
can
do
her
no
violence
individuality
seems
to
be
all
her
aim
and
she
cares
nought
for
individuals
she
is
always
building
and
always
destroying
and
her
workshop
is
not
to
be
approached
nature
lives
in
her
children
only
and
the
mother
where
is
she
she
is
the
sole
artist
out
of
the
simplest
materials
the
greatest
diversity
attaining
with
no
trace
of
effort
the
finest
perfection
the
closest
precision
always
softly
veiled
each
of
her
works
has
an
essence
of
its
own
every
shape
that
she
takes
is
in
idea
utterly
isolated
and
yet
all
forms
one
she
plays
a
drama
whether
she
sees
it
herself
we
know
not
and
yet
she
plays
it
for
us
who
stand
but
a
little
way
off
there
is
constant
life
in
her
motion
and
development
and
yet
she
remains
where
she
was
she
is
eternally
changing
nor
for
a
moment
does
she
stand
still
of
rest
she
knows
nothing
and
to
all
stagnation
she
has
affixed
her
curse
she
is
steadfast
her
step
is
measured
her
exceptions
rare
her
laws
immutable
she
has
thought
and
she
ponders
unceasingly
not
as
a
man
but
as
nature
the
meaning
of
the
whole
she
keeps
to
herself
and
no
one
can
learn
it
of
her
men
are
all
in
her
and
she
in
all
men
with
all
she
plays
a
friendly
game
and
rejoices
the
more
a
man
wins
from
her
with
many
her
game
is
so
secret
that
she
brings
it
to
an
end
before
they
are
aware
of
it
even
what
is
most
unnatural
is
nature
even
the
coarsest
philistinism
has
something
of
her
genius
who
does
not
see
her
everywhere
sees
her
nowhere
aright
she
loves
herself
and
clings
eternally
to
herself
with
eyes
and
hearts
innumerable
she
has
divided
herself
that
she
may
be
her
own
delight
she
is
ever
making
new
creatures
spring
up
to
delight
in
her
and
imparts
herself
insatiably
she
rejoices
in
illusion
if
a
man
destroys
this
in
himself
and
others
she
punishes
him
like
the
hardest
tyrant
if
he
follows
her
in
confidence
she
presses
him
to
her
heart
as
it
were
her
child
her
children
are
numberless
to
no
one
of
them
is
she
altogether
niggardly
but
she
has
her
favourites
on
whom
she
lavishes
much
and
for
whom
she
makes
many
a
sacrifice
over
the
great
she
has
spread
the
shield
of
her
protection
she
spurts
forth
her
creatures
out
of
nothing
and
tells
them
not
whence
they
come
and
whither
they
go
they
have
only
to
go
their
way
she
knows
the
path
her
springs
of
action
are
few
but
they
never
wear
out
they
are
always
working
always
manifold
the
drama
she
plays
is
always
new
because
she
is
always
bringing
new
spectators
life
is
her
fairest
invention
and
death
is
her
device
for
having
life
in
abundance
she
envelops
man
in
darkness
and
urges
him
constantly
to
the
light
she
makes
him
dependent
on
the
earth
heavy
and
sluggish
and
always
rouses
him
up
afresh
she
creates
wants
because
she
loves
movement
how
marvellous
that
she
gains
it
all
so
easily
every
want
is
a
benefit
soon
satisfied
soon
growing
again
if
she
gives
more
it
is
a
new
source
of
desire
but
the
balance
quickly
rights
itself
every
moment
she
starts
on
the
longest
journeys
and
every
moment
reaches
her
goal
she
amuses
herself
with
a
vain
show
but
to
us
her
play
is
she
lets
every
child
work
at
her
every
fool
judge
of
her
and
thousands
pass
her
by
and
see
nothing
and
she
has
her
joy
in
them
all
and
in
them
all
finds
her
account
man
obeys
her
laws
even
in
opposing
them
he
works
with
her
even
when
he
wants
to
work
against
her
everything
she
gives
is
found
to
be
good
for
first
of
all
she
makes
it
indispensable
she
lingers
that
we
may
long
for
presence
she
hurries
by
that
we
may
not
grow
weary
of
her
speech
or
language
she
has
none
but
she
creates
tongues
and
hearts
through
which
she
feels
and
speaks
her
crown
is
love
only
through
love
can
we
come
near
her
she
puts
gulfs
between
all
things
and
all
things
strive
to
be
interfused
she
isolates
everything
that
she
may
draw
everything
together
with
a
few
draughts
from
the
cup
of
love
she
repays
for
a
life
full
of
trouble
she
is
all
things
she
rewards
herself
and
punishes
herself
and
in
herself
rejoices
and
is
distressed
she
is
rough
and
gentle
loving
and
terrible
powerless
and
almighty
in
her
everything
is
always
present
past
or
future
she
knows
not
the
present
is
her
eternity
she
is
kind
i
praise
her
with
all
her
works
she
is
wise
and
still
no
one
can
force
her
to
explain
herself
or
frighten
her
into
a
gift
that
she
does
not
give
willingly
she
is
crafty
but
for
a
good
end
and
it
is
best
not
to
notice
her
cunning
she
is
whole
and
yet
never
finished
as
she
works
now
so
can
she
work
for
ever
to
every
one
she
appears
in
a
form
of
his
own
she
hides
herself
in
a
thousand
names
and
terms
and
is
always
the
same
she
has
placed
me
in
this
world
she
will
also
lead
me
out
of
it
i
trust
myself
to
her
she
may
do
with
me
as
she
pleases
she
will
not
hate
her
work
i
did
not
speak
of
her
no
what
is
true
and
what
is
