western
wind
and
open
surge
tore
us
from
our
mothers
flung
us
on
a
naked
shore
twelve
bleak
houses
by
the
shore
seven
summers
by
the
shore
two
hundred
brothers
there
we
met
with
famous
men
set
in
office
us
and
they
beat
on
us
with
rods
faithfully
with
many
rods
daily
beat
us
on
with
rods
for
the
love
they
bore
us
out
of
egypt
unto
troy
over
himalaya
far
and
sure
our
bands
have
gone
or
babylon
islands
of
the
southern
run
and
cities
of
cathaia
and
we
all
praise
famous
men
ancients
of
the
college
for
they
taught
us
common
sense
tried
to
teach
us
common
sense
truth
and
god
own
common
sense
which
is
more
than
knowledge
each
degree
of
latitude
strung
about
creation
seeth
one
or
more
of
us
of
one
muster
all
of
us
of
one
master
all
of
us
keen
in
his
vocation
this
we
learned
from
famous
men
knowing
not
its
uses
when
they
showed
in
daily
work
man
must
finish
off
his
work
right
or
wrong
his
daily
work
and
without
excuses
servants
of
the
staff
and

mine
and
fuse
and
grapnel
some
before
the
face
of
kings
stand
before
the
face
of
kings
bearing
gifts
to
divers
kings
gifts
of
case
and
shrapnel
this
we
learned
from
famous
men
teaching
in
our
borders
who
declare
it
was
best
safest
easiest
and
best
expeditious
wise
and
best
to
obey
your
orders
some
beneath
the
further
stars
bear
the
greater
burden
set

serve
the
lands
they
rule
save
he
serve
no
man
may
rule
serve
and
love
the
lands
they
rule
seeking
praise
nor
guerdon
this
we
learned
from
famous
men
knowing
not
we
learned
it
only
as
the
years
went
by
lonely
as
the
years
went
by
far
from
help
as
years
went
by
plainer
we
discerned
it
wherefore
praise
we
famous
men
from
whose
bays
we
borrow
they
that
put
aside
today
all
the
joys
of
their
today
and
with

for
us

in
in
summer
all
boys
built
huts
in
the
behind
the
college
little
lairs
whittled
out
of
the
heart
of
the
prickly
bushes
full
of
stumps
odd
and
spikes
but
since
they
were
strictly
forbidden
palaces
of
delight
and
for
the
fifth
summer
in
succession
stalky
mcturk
and
beetle
this
was
before
they
reached
the
dignity
of
a
study
had
built
like
beavers
a
place
of
retreat
and
meditation
where
they
smoked
now
there
was
nothing
in
their
characters
as
known
to
prout
their
at
all
commanding
respect
nor
did
foxy
the
subtle
school
sergeant
trust
them
his
business
was
to
wear
carry
binoculars
and
swoop
hawklike
upon
evil
boys
had
he
taken
the
field
alone
that
hut
would
have
been
raided
for
foxy
knew
the
manners
of
his
quarry
but
providence
moved
prout
whose
derived
from
the
size
of
his
feet
was
hoofer
to
investigate
on
his
own
account
and
it
was
the
cautious
stalky
who
found
the
track
of
his
pugs
on
the
very
floor
of
their
lair
one
peaceful
afternoon
when
stalky
would
fain
have
forgotten
prout
and
his
works
in
a
volume
of
surtees
and
a
new
pipe
crusoe
at
sight
of
the
footprint
did
not
act
more
swiftly
than
stalky
he
removed
the
pipes
swept
up
all
loose
and
departed
to
warn
beetle
and
mcturk
but
it
was
characteristic
of
the
boy
that
he
did
not
approach
his
allies
till
he
had
met
and
conferred
with
little
hartopp
president
of
the
natural
history
society
an
institution
which
stalky
held
in
contempt
hartopp
was
more
than
surprised
when
the
boy
meekly
as
he
knew
how
begged
to
propose
himself
beetle
and
mcturk
as
candidates
confessed
to
a
interest
in
early
butterflies
and
new
arrivals
and
volunteered
if
hartopp
saw
fit
to
enter
on
the
new
life
at
once
being
a
master
hartopp
was
suspicious
but
he
was
also
an
enthusiast
and
his
gentle
little
soul
had
been
galled
by
remarks
from
the
three
and
specially
beetle
so
he
was
gracious
to
that
repentant
sinner
and
entered
the
three
names
in
his
book
then
and
not
till
then
did
stalky
seek
beetle
and
mcturk
in
their
house
they
were
stowing
away
books
for
a
quiet
afternoon
in
the
furze
which
they
called
the
all
up
said
stalky
serenely
i
spotted
heffy
fairy
feet
round
our
hut
after
dinner
they
so
did
you
hide
our
pipes
said
beetle
oh
no
left
in
the
middle
of
the
hut
of
course
what
a
blind
ass
you
are
beetle
think
nobody
thinks
but
yourself
well
we
use
the
hut
any
more
hoofer
will
be
watchin
likewise
blow
said
mcturk
thoughtfully
unpacking
the
volumes
with
which
his
chest
was
cased
the
boys
carried
their
libraries
between
their
belt
and
their
collar
nice
job
this
means
we
under
suspicion
for
the
rest
of
the
why
all
that
heffy
has
found
is
a
hut
he
and
foxy
will
watch
it
nothing
to
do
with
us
only
we
must
be
seen
that
way
for
a
yes
and
where
else
are
we
to
go
said
beetle
you
chose
that
place
too
an
an
i
wanted
to
read
this
stalky
sat
on
a
desk
drumming
his
heels
on
the
form

a
despondin
brute
beetle
sometimes
i
think
i
shall
have
to
drop
you
altogether
did
you
ever

your
uncle
stalky
forget
you
yet
rebus
after
i
seen
heffy
round
our
hut
i
found
little
hartopp
wavin
a
i
conciliated
hartopp
him
that

read
papers
to
the
if
he
let
you
join
beetle
him
you
liked
butterflies
turkey
anyhow
i
soothed
the
hartoffles
and
what
the
good
of
that
said
beetle
oh
turkey
kick
him
in
the
interests
of
science
bounds
were
largely
relaxed
for
the
members
of
the
natural
history
society
they
could
wander
if
they
kept
clear
of
all
houses
practically
where
they
chose
hartopp
holding
himself
responsible
for
their
good
conduct
beetle
began
to
see
this
as
mcturk
began
the
kicking
i
an
ass
stalky
he
said
guarding
the
afflicted
part
turkey
i
an
do

your
uncle

a
great
man
great
man

beetle
all
the
same
a
filthy
business
said
mcturk
how
the
deuce
does
one
begin
this
way
said
stalky
turning
to
some
fags
lockers
behind
him
fags
are
dabs
at
natural
history
here
young
braybrooke
he
flung
out
a
tangle
of
decayed
roots
and
adjusted
the
slide
one
no
end
of
a
professional
air
i
think
here
clay
minor
geological
hammer
beetle
can
carry
that
turkey
you
better
covet
a
from
i
blowed
if
i
do
said
mcturk
simply
with
immense
feeling
beetle
give
me
the
all
right
i
not
proud
chuck
us
down
that
net
on
top
of
the
lockers
that
all
right
it
a
collapsible
jamboree
too
beastly
luxurious
dogs
these
fags
are
built
like
a
my
sainted
sam
but
we
look
the
complete
now
listen
to
your
uncle
stalky
we
goin
along
the
cliffs
after
butterflies
very
few
chaps
come
there
we
goin
to
leg
it
too
you
better
leave
your
book
not
much
said
beetle
firmly
i
not
goin
to
be
done
out
of
my
fun
for
a
lot
of
filthy
then
you
sweat
horrid
you
better
carry
my
jorrocks
make
you
any
they
all
sweated
for
stalky
led
them
at
a
smart
trot
west
away
along
the
cliffs
under
the
crossing
combe
after
gorzy
combe
they
took
no
heed
to
flying
rabbits
or
fluttering
fritillaries
and
all
that
turkey
said
of
geology
was
utterly
unquotable
are
we
going
to
clovelly
he
puffed
at
last
and
they
flung
themselves
down
on
the
short
springy
turf
between
the
drone
of
the
sea
below
and
the
light
summer
wind
among
the
inland
trees
they
were
looking
into
a
combe
half
full
of
old
high
furze
in
gay
bloom
that
ran
up
to
a
fringe
of
brambles
and
a
dense
wood
of
mixed
timber
and
hollies
it
was
as
though
the
combe
were
filled
with
golden
fire
to
the
edge
the
side
nearest
to
them
was
open
grass
and
fairly
bristled
with
old
cove
this
said
stalky
reading
the
nearest
with
the
utmost
rigour
of
the
dabney
an
all
the
rest
of
it
seem
to
me
that
any
chap
in
his
senses
would
trespass
here
does
it
you
got
to
prove
damage
you
can
prosecute
for
anything
prosecute
for
trespass
said
mcturk
whose
father
held
many
acres
in
ireland
that
all
rot
glad
of
that
this
looks
like
what
we
wanted
not
straight
across
beetle
you
blind
lunatic
anyone
could
spot
us
half
a
mile
off
this
way
and
furl
up
your
beastly
beetle
disconnected
the
ring
thrust
the
net
into
a
pocket
shut
up
the
handle
to
a
stave
and
slid
the
round
his
waist
stalky
led
inland
to
the
wood
which
was
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
sea
and
reached
the
fringe
of
the
brambles
we
can
get
straight
down
through
the
furze
and
never
show
up
at
all
said
the
tactician
beetle
go
ahead
and
explore
snf
snf
beastly
stink
of
fox
somewhere
on
all
fours
save
when
he
clung
to
his
spectacles
beetle
wormed
into
the
gorse
and
presently
announced
between
grunts
of
pain
that
he
had
found
a
very
fair
this
was
well
for
beetle
since
stalky
pinched
him
down
that
tunnel
they
crawled
it
was
evidently
a
highway
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
combe
and
to
their
inexpressible
joy
ended
at
the
very
edge
of
the
cliff
in
a
few
square
feet
of
dry
turf
walled
and
roofed
with
impenetrable
gorse
by
gum
there
is
a
single
thing
to
do
except
lie
down
said
stalky
returning
a
knife
to
his
pocket
look
here
he
parted
the
tough
stems
before
him
and
it
was
as
a
window
opened
on
a
far
view
of
lundy
and
the
deep
sea
sluggishly
nosing
the
pebbles
a
couple
of
hundred
feet
below
they
could
hear
young
jackdaws
squawking
on
the
ledges
the
hiss
and
jabber
of
a
nest
of
hawks
somewhere
out
of
sight
and
with
great
deliberation
stalky
spat
on
to
the
back
of
a
young
rabbit
sunning
himself
far
down
where
only
a
could
have
found
great
gray
and
black
gulls
screamed
against
the
jackdaws
the
acres
of
bloom
round
them
were
alive
with
birds
singing
or
silent
as
the
shadow
of
the
wheeling
hawks
passed
and
returned
and
on
the
naked
turf
across
the
combe
rabbits
thumped
and
frolicked
whew
what
a
place
talk
of
natural
history
this
is
it
said
stalky
filling
himself
a
pipe
is
it
scrumptious
good
old
sea
he
spat
again
approvingly
and
was
silent
mcturk
and
beetle
had
taken
out
their
books
and
were
lying
on
their
stomachs
chin
in
hand
the
sea
snored
and
gurgled
the
birds
scattered
for
the
moment
by
these
new
animals
returned
to
their
businesses
and
the
boys
read
on
in
the
rich
warm
sleepy
silence
hullo
here
a
keeper
said
stalky
shutting
handley
cross
cautiously
and
peering
through
the
jungle
a
man
with
a
gun
appeared
on
the
to
the
east
confound
him
he
going
to
sit
he
swear
we
were
poachin
too
said
beetle
what
the
good
of
pheasants
eggs
they
always
addled
might
as
well
get
up
to
the
wood
i
think
said
stalky
we
do
want
dabney
to
be
bothered
about
us
so
soon
up
the
wuzzy
and
keep
quiet
he
may
have
followed
us
you
beetle
was
already
far
up
the
tunnel
they
heard
him
gasp
indescribably
there
was
the
crash
of
a
heavy
body
leaping
through
the
furze
aie
yeou
little
red
rascal
i
see
yeou
the
keeper
threw
the
gun
to
his
shoulder
and
fired
both
barrels
in
their
direction
the
pellets
dusted
the
dry
stems
round
them
as
a
big
fox
plunged
between
legs
and
ran
over
the
they
said
nothing
till
they
reached
the
wood
torn
disheveled
hot
but
unseen
narrow
squeak
said
stalky
i
swear
some
of
the
pellets
went
through
my
did
you
see
him
said
beetle
i
almost
put
my
hand
on
him
he
a
wopper
did
he
stink
hullo
turkey
what
the
matter
are
you
hit
mcturk
lean
face
had
turned
pearly
white
his
mouth
generally
half
open
was
tight
shut
and
his
eyes
blazed
they
had
never
seen
him
like
this
save
once
in
a
sad
time
of
civil
war
do
you
know
that
that
was
just
as
bad
as
murder
he
said
in
a
grating
voice
as
he
brushed
prickles
from
his
head
well
he
did
hit
us
said
stalky
i
think
it
was
rather
a
lark
here
where
are
you
going
i
going
up
to
the
house
if
there
is
one
said
mcturk
pushing
through
the
hollies
i
am
going
to
tell
this
colonel
are
you
crazy
he
swear
it
served
us
jolly
well
right
he
report
us
it
be
a
public
lickin
oh
turkey
do
be
an
ass
think
of
us
you
fool
said
mcturk
turning
savagely
suppose
i
of
it
the
he
cracked
said
beetle
miserably
as
they
followed
indeed
this
was
a
new
turkey
a
haughty
angular
turkey
whom
they
accompanied
through
a
shrubbery
on
to
a
lawn
where
a
old
gentleman
with
a
cleek
was
alternately
putting
and
blaspheming
vigorously
are
you
colonel
dabney
mcturk
began
in
this
new
creaking
voice
of
his
i
i
am
and
his
eyes
traveled
up
and
down
the
boy
who
what
the
devil
want
ye
been
disturbing
my
pheasants
do
attempt
to
deny
it
ye
need
laugh
at
mcturk
not
too
lovely
features
had
twisted
themselves
into
a
horrible
sneer
at
the
word
pheasant
been
you
need
hide
your
hat
i
can
see
that
you
belong
to
the
college
do
attempt
to
deny
it
ye
do
your
name
and
number
at
once
sir
ye
want
to
speak
to
me
eh
you
saw
my
must
have
do
attempt
to
deny
it
ye
did
damnable
oh
damnable
he
choked
with
emotion
mcturk
heel
tapped
the
lawn
and
he
stuttered
a
little
two
sure
signs
that
he
was
losing
his
temper
but
why
should
he
the
offender
be
angry
here
sir
do
do
you
shoot
foxes
because
if
you
do
your
keeper
does
we
seen
him
i
care
what
you
call
us
but
an
awful
thing
it
the
ruin
of
good
feelin
among
neighbors
a
ought
to
say
once
and
for
all
how
he
stands
about
preservin
worse
than
murder
because
there
no
legal
mcturk
was
quoting
confusedly
from
his
father
while
the
old
gentleman
made
noises
in
his
throat
do
you
know
who
i
am
he
gurgled
at
last
stalky
and
beetle
quaking
no
sorr
nor
do
i
care
if
ye
belonged
to
the
castle
itself
answer
me
now
as
one
gentleman
to
another
do
ye
shoot
foxes
or
do
ye
not
and
four
years
before
stalky
and
beetle
had
carefully
kicked
mcturk
out
of
his
irish
dialect
assuredly
he
had
gone
mad
or
taken
a
sunstroke
and
as
assuredly
he
would
be
slain
once
by
the
old
gentleman
and
once
by
the
head
a
public
licking
for
the
three
was
the
least
they
could
expect
yet
if
their
eyes
and
ears
were
to
be
trusted
the
old
gentleman
had
collapsed
it
might
be
a
lull
before
the
storm
but
i
do
he
was
still
gurgling
then
you
must
sack
your
keeper
he
not
fit
to
live
in
the
same
county
with
a
fox
an
a
vixen
too
at
this
time
o
year
did
ye
come
up
on
purpose
to
tell
me
this
of
course
i
did
ye
silly
man
with
a
stamp
of
the
foot
would
you
not
have
done
as
much
for
me
if
you
seen
that
thing
happen
on
my
land
now
forgotten
forgotten
was
the
college
and
the
decency
due
to
elders
mcturk
was
treading
again
the
barren
purple
mountains
of
the
rainy
west
coast
where
in
his
holidays
he
was
viceroy
of
four
thousand
naked
acres
only
son
of
a
house
lord
of
a
crazy
and
the
idol
of
his
father
shiftless
tenantry
it
was
the
landed
man
speaking
to
his
equal
deep
calling
to
deep
and
the
old
gentleman
acknowledged
the
cry
i
apologize
said
he
i
apologize
unreservedly
to
you
and
to
the
old
country
now
will
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
your
story
we
were
in
your
combe
mcturk
began
and
he
told
his
tale
alternately
as
a
schoolboy
and
when
the
iniquity
of
the
thing
overcame
him
as
an
indignant
squire
concluding
so
you
see
he
must
be
in
the
habit
of
it
i
we
never
wants
to
accuse
a
neighbor
man
but
i
took
the
liberty
in
this
case
i
see
quite
so
for
a
reason
ye
had
infamous
infamous
the
two
had
fallen
into
step
beside
each
other
on
the
lawn
and
colonel
dabney
was
talking
as
one
man
to
another
this
comes
of
promoting
a
fisherman
a
fisherman
from
his
it
enough
to
ruin
the
reputation
of
an
archangel
do
attempt
to
deny
it
it
is
your
father
has
brought
you
up
well
he
has
i
much
like
the
pleasure
of
his
acquaintance
very
much
indeed
and
these
young
gentlemen
english
they
are
do
attempt
to
deny
it
they
came
up
with
you
too
extraordinary
extraordinary
now
in
the
present
state
of
education
i
should
have
thought
any
three
boys
would
be
well
enough
grounded
but
out
of
the
mouths
of
no
no
not
that
by
any
odds
do
attempt
to
deny
it
ye
not
sherry
always
catches
me
under
the
liver
but
beer
now
eh
what
say
to
beer
and
something
to
eat
it
long
since
i
was
a
boy
abominable
nuisances
but
exceptions
prove
the
rule
and
a
vixen
too
they
were
fed
on
the
terrace
by
a
housekeeper
stalky
and
beetle
merely
ate
but
mcturk
with
bright
eyes
continued
a
free
and
lofty
discourse
and
ever
the
old
gentleman
treated
him
as
a
brother
my
dear
man
of
course
ye
can
come
again
did
i
not
say
exceptions
prove
the
rule
the
lower
combe
man
dear
anywhere
ye
please
so
long
as
you
do
not
disturb
my
pheasants
the
two
are
not
incompatible
attempt
to
deny
it
they
not
i
never
allow
another
gun
though
come
and
go
as
ye
please
i
not
see
you
and
ye
need
see
me
been
well
brought
up
another
glass
of
beer
now
i
tell
you
a
fisherman
he
was
and
a
fisherman
he
shall
be
again
he
shall
wish
i
could
drown
him
i
convoy
you
to
the
lodge
my
people
are
not
precisely
ah
broke
to
boy
but
they
know
you
he
dismissed
them
with
many
compliments
by
the
high
in
the
park
palings
and
they
stood
still
even
stalky
who
had
played
second
not
to
say
a
dumb
fiddle
regarding
mcturk
as
one
from
another
world
the
two
glasses
of
strong
had
brought
a
melancholy
upon
the
boy
for
slowly
strolling
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
crooned
oh
paddy
dear
and
did
ye
hear
the
news
that
goin
round
under
other
circumstances
stalky
and
beetle
would
have
fallen
upon
him
for
that
song
was
barred
utterly
anathema
the
sin
of
witchcraft
but
seeing
what
he
had
wrought
they
danced
round
him
in
silence
waiting
till
it
pleased
him
to
touch
earth
the
rang
when
they
were
still
half
a
mile
from
college
mcturk
shivered
and
came
out
of
dreams
the
glory
of
his
holiday
estate
had
left
him
he
was
a
colleger
of
the
college
speaking
english
once
more
turkey
it
was
immense
said
stalky
generously
i
did
know
you
had
it
in
you
you
got
us
a
hut
for
the
rest
of
the
term
where
we
simply
be
collared
fids
fids
oh
fids
i
gloat
hear
me
gloat
they
spun
wildly
on
their
heels
jodeling
after
the
accepted
manner
of
a
gloat
which
is
not
unremotely
allied
to
the
primitive
man
song
of
triumph
and
dropped
down
the
hill
by
the
path
from
the
gasometer
just
in
time
to
meet
their
who
had
spent
the
afternoon
watching
their
abandoned
hut
in
the
unluckily
all
prout
imagination
leaned
to
the
darker
side
of
life
and
he
looked
on
those
cherubims
most
sourly
boys
that
he
understood
attended
and
could
be
accounted
for
at
any
moment
but
he
had
heard
mcturk
openly
deride
cricket
even
beetle
views
on
the
honor
of
the
house
he
knew
were
incendiary
and
he
could
never
tell
when
the
soft
and
smiling
stalky
was
laughing
at
him
consequently
since
human
nature
is
what
it
is
those
boys
had
been
doing
wrong
somewhere
he
hoped
it
was
nothing
very
serious
but
i
gloat
hear
me
stalky
still
on
his
heels
whirled
like
a
dancing
dervish
to
the
i
gloat
hear
me
beetle
spun
behind
him
with
outstretched
arms
i
gloat
hear
me
mcturk
voice
cracked
now
was
there
or
was
there
not
a
distinct
flavor
of
beer
as
they
shot
past
prout
he
was
unlucky
in
that
his
conscience
as
a
impelled
him
to
consult
his
associates
had
he
taken
his
pipe
and
his
troubles
to
little
hartopp
rooms
he
would
perhaps
have
been
saved
confusion
for
hartopp
believed
in
boys
and
knew
something
about
them
his
fate
led
him
to
king
a
fellow
no
friend
of
his
but
a
zealous
hater
of
stalky
said
king
rubbing
his
hands
when
the
tale
was
told
curious
now
house
never
dream
of
doing
these
but
you
see
i
no
proof
proof
with
the
egregious
beetle
as
if
one
wanted
it
i
suppose
it
is
not
impossible
for
the
sergeant
to
supply
it
foxy
is
considered
at
least
a
match
for
any
evasive
boy
in
my
house
of
course
they
were
smoking
and
drinking
somewhere
that
type
of
boy
always
does
they
think
it
but
they
no
following
in
the
school
and
they
are
distinctly
er
brutal
to
their
juniors
said
prout
who
had
from
a
distance
seen
beetle
return
with
interest
his
to
a
tearful
fag
ah
they
consider
themselves
superior
to
ordinary
delights
little
animals
there
something
in
mcturk
hibernian
sneer
that
would
make
me
a
little
annoyed
and
they
are
so
careful
to
avoid
all
overt
acts
too
it
sheer
calculated
insolence
i
am
strongly
opposed
as
you
know
to
interfering
with
another
man
house
but
they
need
a
lesson
prout
they
need
a
sharp
lesson
if
only
to
bring
down
their
were
i
you
i
should
devote
myself
for
a
week
to
their
little
performances
boys
of
that
order
and
i
may
flatter
myself
but
i
think
i
know
boys
do
join
the
for
love
tell
the
sergeant
to
keep
his
eye
open
and
of
course
in
my
peregrinations
i
may
casually
keep
mine
open
i
gloat
hear
me
far
down
the
corridor
disgusting
said
king
where
do
they
pick
up
these
obscene
noises
one
sharp
lesson
is
what
they
the
boys
did
not
concern
themselves
with
lessons
for
the
next
few
days
they
had
all
colonel
dabney
estate
to
play
with
and
they
explored
it
with
the
stealth
of
red
indians
and
the
accuracy
of
burglars
they
could
enter
either
by
the
on
the
upper
road
they
were
careful
to
ingratiate
themselves
with
the
and
his
wife
drop
down
into
the
combe
and
return
along
the
cliffs
or
they
could
begin
at
the
combe
and
climb
up
into
the
road
they
were
careful
not
to
cross
the
colonel
path
he
had
served
his
turn
and
they
would
not
their
welcome
nor
did
they
show
up
on
the
when
they
could
move
in
cover
the
shelter
of
the
gorze
by
the
was
their
chosen
retreat
beetle
christened
it
the
pleasant
isle
of
aves
for
the
peace
and
the
shelter
of
it
and
here
the
pipes
and
tobacco
once
cache
in
a
convenient
ledge
an
arm
length
down
the
cliff
their
position
was
legally
unassailable
for
observe
colonel
dabney
had
not
invited
them
to
enter
his
house
therefore
they
did
not
need
to
ask
specific
leave
to
go
visiting
and
school
rules
were
strict
on
that
point
he
had
merely
thrown
open
his
grounds
to
them
and
since
they
were
lawful
their
extended
bounds
ran
up
to
his
in
the
combe
and
his
on
the
hill
they
were
amazed
at
their
own
virtue
and
even
if
it
was
said
stalky
flat
on
his
back
staring
into
the
blue
even
suppose
we
were
miles
out
of
bounds
no
one
could
get
at
us
through
this
wuzzy
unless
he
knew
the
tunnel
is
this
better
than
lyin
up
just
behind
the
in
a
blue
funk
every
time
we
had
a
smoke
is
your
uncle
stalky
no
said
beetle
he
was
stretched
at
the
edge
of
the
cliff
spitting
thoughtfully
we
got
to
thank
turkey
for
this
turkey
is
the
great
man
turkey
dear
you
distressing
gloomy
old
ass
said
mcturk
deep
in
a
book
they
got
us
under
suspicion
said
stalky
hoophats
so
suspicious
somehow
and
foxy
always
makes
every
stalk
he
does
a
sort
of
sort
of
scalp
said
beetle
foxy
a
giddy
poor
foxy
said
stalky
he
goin
to
catch
us
one
of
these
days
to
me
in
the
gym
last
night
got
my
eye
on
you
mister
corkran
i
only
warning
you

i
only
warnin

good
foxy

yes
but
it
only
fair
sport
for
foxy
said
beetle
it
hefflelinga
that
has
the
evil
mind
wonder
if
he
thought
we
got
i
never
got
squiffy
but
once
that
was
in
the
holidays
said
stalky
reflectively
an
it
made
me
horrid
sick
my
sacred
sam
though
it
enough
to
drive
a
man
to
drink
havin
an
animal
like
hoof
for
if
we
attended
the
matches
an
yelled
hit
sir
an
stood
on
one
leg
an
grinned
every
time
heffy
said
ho
my
sons
is
it
thus
an
said
sir
an
sir
an
sir
an
sir
like
a
lot
o
filthy
heffy
think
no
end
of
us
said
mcturk
with
a
sneer
too
late
to
begin
it
all
right
the
hefflelinga
means
well
he
is
an
ass
we
show
him
that
we
think
he
an
ass
an
heffy
do
love
us
me
last
night
after
prayers
that
he
was
loco
beetle
grunted
the
deuce
he
did
cried
stalky
that
means
he
maturin
something
unusual
dam
mean
last
time
he
told
me
that
he
gave
me
three
hundred
lines
for
dancin
the
cachuca
in
number
ten
dormitory
by
gum
but
what
the
odds
as
long
as
you
all
they
were
and
their
very
rightness
puzzled
prout
king
and
the
sergeant
boys
with
bad
consciences
show
it
they
slink
out
past
the
fives
court
in
haste
and
smile
nervously
when
questioned
they
return
disordered
in
bare
time
to
save
a
they
nod
and
wink
and
giggle
one
to
the
other
scattering
at
the
approach
of
a
master
but
stalky
and
his
allies
had
long
these
manifestations
of
youth
they
strolled
forth
unconcernedly
and
returned
in
excellent
shape
after
a
light
refreshment
of
strawberries
and
cream
at
the
lodge
the
had
been
promoted
to
keeper
the
murderous
fisherman
and
his
wife
made
much
of
the
boys
the
man
too
gave
them
a
squirrel
which
they
presented
to
the
natural
history
society
thereby
checkmating
little
hartopp
who
wished
to
know
what
they
were
doing
for
science
foxy
faithfully
worked
some
deep
devon
lanes
behind
a
lonely
inn
and
it
was
curious
that
prout
and
king
members
of
seldom
friendly
walked
together
in
the
same
direction
that
is
to
say
northeast
now
the
pleasant
isle
of
aves
lay
due
southwest
deep
deep
said
stalky
why
are
they
drawin
those
covers
me
said
beetle
sweetly
i
asked
foxy
if
he
had
ever
tasted
the
beer
there
that
was
enough
for
foxy
and
it
cheered
him
up
a
little
he
and
heffy
were
sniffin
round
our
old
hut
so
long
i
thought
they
like
a
well
it
ca
last
forever
said
stalky
heffy
bankin
up
like
a
an
king
goes
rubbin
his
beastly
hands
an
like
a
hyena
it
shockin
demoralizin
for
king
he
burst
some
that
day
came
a
little
sooner
than
they
expected
came
when
the
sergeant
whose
duty
it
was
to
collect
defaulters
did
not
attend
an
afternoon
tired
of
pubs
eh
he
gone
up
to
the
top
of
the
bill
with
his
binoculars
to
spot
us
said
stalky
wonder
he
did
think
of
that
before
did
you
see
old
heffy
cock
his
eye
at
us
when
we
answered
our
names
heffy
in
it
too
i
gloat
hear
me
come
on
aves
said
beetle
of
course
but
i
not
smokin
jolly
well
that
we
be
we
go
along
the
cliffs
slow
an
give
foxy
lots
of
time
to
parallel
us
up
they
strolled
towards
the
and
presently
overtook
king
oh
do
let
interrupt
you
he
said
engaged
in
scientific
pursuits
of
course
i
trust
you
will
enjoy
yourselves
my
young
you
see
said
stalky
when
they
were
out
of
earshot
he
keep
a
secret
he
followin
to
cut
off
our
line
of
retreat
he
wait
at
the
baths
till
heffy
comes
along
they
tried
every
blessed
place
except
along
the
cliffs
and
now
they
think
they
bottled
us
no
need
to
they
walked
leisurely
over
the
combes
till
they
reached
the
line
of
listen
a
shake
foxy
up
wind
comin
down
hill
like
beans
when
you
hear
him
move
in
the
bushes
go
straight
across
to
aves
they
want
to
catch
us
they
dived
into
the
gorse
at
right
angles
to
the
tunnel
openly
crossing
the
grass
and
lay
still
in
aves
what
did
i
tell
you
stalky
carefully
put
away
the
pipes
and
tobacco
the
sergeant
out
of
breath
was
leaning
against
the
fence
raking
the
furze
with
his
binoculars
but
he
might
as
well
have
tried
to
see
through
a
anon
prout
and
king
appeared
behind
him
they
conferred
aha
foxy
do
like
the
and
he
do
like
the
prickles
either
now
we
cut
up
the
tunnel
and
go
to
the
lodge
hullo
sent
foxy
into
the
sergeant
was
in
crackling
swaying
furze
his
ears
filled
with
the
noise
of
his
own
progress
the
boys
reached
the
shelter
of
the
wood
and
looked
down
through
a
belt
of
hollies
hellish
noise
said
stalky
critically
think
colonel
dabney
will
like
it
i
move
we
go
into
the
lodge
and
get
something
to
eat

might
as
well
see
the
fun
suddenly
the
keeper
passed
them
at
a
trot
who
they
to
for
lard

he
said
poachers
simly
stalky
replied
in
the
broad
devon
that
was
the
de
i
poach
to
raights
he
dropped
into
the
combe
which
presently
began
to
fill
with
noises
notably

a
scuffle
of

of

sobbed
mcturk
groping
for
the

and
kicking
the
prostrate
beetle
before
him
they
found
the
beast
in
an
box
left
two
for
payment
and
staggered
home
only
the
badger
grunted
most
marvelous
like
colonel
dabney
and
they
dropped
him
twice
or
thrice
with
shrieks
of
helpless
laughter
they
were
but
imperfectly
recovered
when
foxy
met
them
by
the
fives
court
with
word
that
they
were
to
go
up
to
their
dormitory
and
wait
till
sent
for
well
take
this
box
to

done
something
for
the
natural
history
society
at
any
rate
said
beetle
that
wo
save
you
young
foxy
answered
in
an
awful
voice
he
was
sorely
ruffled
in
his
mind
all
sereno
stalky
had
reached
the
extreme
stage
of
hiccups
we
we
never
desert
you
foxy
hounds
choppin
foxes
in
cover
is
more
a
proof
of
vice
ai
it
no
you
right
i
i
not
quite
they
gone
a
bit
too
far
this
time
foxy
thought
to
himself
very
far
gone
say
excep
there
was
no
smell
of
liquor
an
yet
it
is
like
somehow
king
and
prout
they
their
same
as
me
that
one
now
we
must
pull
up
said
stalky
rising
from
the
bed
on
which
he
had
thrown
himself
we
injured
innocence
as
usual
we
do
know
what
we
been
sent
up
here
for
do
we
no
explanation
deprived
of
tea
public
disgrace
before
the
house
said
mcturk
whose
eyes
were
running
over
it
dam
well
hold
on
till
king
loses
his
temper
said
beetle
he
a
libelous
old
rip
an
he
be
in
a
ravin
prout
too
beastly
cautious
keep
your
eye
on
king
and
if
he
gives
us
a
chance
appeal
to
the
head
that
always
makes
they
were
summoned
to
their
study
king
and
foxy
supporting
prout
and
foxy
had
three
canes
under
his
arm
king
leered
triumphantly
for
there
were
tears
undried
tears
of
mirth
on
the
cheeks
then
the
examination
began
yes
they
had
walked
along
the
cliffs
yes
they
had
entered
colonel
dabney
grounds
yes
they
had
seen
the
at
this
point
beetle
sputtered
hysterically
for
what
purpose
had
they
entered
colonel
dabney
grounds
well
sir
there
was
a
here
king
who
loathed
the
natural
history
society
because
he
did
not
like
hartopp
could
no
longer
be
restrained
he
begged
them
not
to
add
mendacity
to
open
insolence
but
the
badger
was
in
hartopp
rooms
sir
the
sergeant
had
kindly
taken
it
up
for
them
that
disposed
of
the
badger
and
the
temporary
check
brought
king
temper
to
they
could
hear
his
foot
on
the
floor
while
prout
prepared
his
lumbering
inquiries
they
had
settled
into
their
stride
now
their
eyes
ceased
to
sparkle
their
faces
were
blank
their
hands
hung
beside
them
without
a
twitch
they
were
learning
at
the
expense
of
a
the
lesson
of
their
race
which
is
to
put
away
all
emotion
and
entrap
the
alien
at
the
proper
time
so
far
good
king
was
importing
himself
more
freely
into
the
trial
being
vengeful
where
prout
was
grieved
they
knew
the
penalties
of
trespassing
with
a
fine
show
of
irresolution
stalky
admitted
that
he
had
gathered
some
information
vaguely
bearing
on
this
head
but
he
thought
the
sentence
was
dragged
out
to
the
uttermost
stalky
did
not
wish
to
play
his
trump
with
such
an
opponent
king
desired
no
buts
nor
was
he
interested
in
stalky
evasions
they
on
the
other
hand
might
be
interested
in
his
poor
views
boys
who
crept
who
sneaked
who
lurked
out
of
bounds
even
the
generous
bounds
of
the
natural
history
society
which
they
had
falsely
joined
as
a
cloak
for
their
misdeeds
their
vices
their
villainies
their
immoralities
he
break
cover
in
a
minute
said
stalky
to
himself
then
we
run
into
him
before
he
gets
such
boys
scabrous
boys
moral
lepers
the
current
of
his
words
was
carrying
king
off
his
feet
liars
yea
incipient
drunkards
he
was
merely
working
up
to
a
peroration
and
the
boys
knew
it
but
mcturk
cut
through
the
frothing
sentence
the
others
echoing
i
appeal
to
the
head
i
appeal
to
the
head
i
appeal
to
the
head
it
was
their
unquestioned
right
drunkenness
meant
expulsion
after
a
public
flogging
they
had
been
accused
of
it
the
case
was
the
head
and
the
head
alone
thou
hast
appealed
unto
caesar
unto
caesar
shalt
thou
they
had
heard
that
sentence
once
or
twice
before
in
their
careers
none
the
less
said
king
uneasily
you
would
be
better
advised
to
abide
by
our
decision
my
young
are
we
allowed
to
associate
with
the
rest
of
the
school
till
we
see
the
head
sir
said
mcturk
to
his
disregarding
king
this
at
once
lifted
the
situation
to
its
loftiest
plane
moreover
it
meant
no
work
for
moral
leprosy
was
strictly
quarantined
and
the
head
never
executed
judgment
till
cold
hours
later
well
er
if
you
persist
in
your
defiant
attitude
said
king
with
a
loving
look
at
the
canes
under
foxy
arm
there
is
no
ten
minutes
later
the
news
was
over
the
whole
school
stalky
and
had
fallen
at
last
fallen
by
drink
they
had
been
drinking
they
had
returned
from
a
hut
they
were
even
now
lying
hopelessly
intoxicated
on
the
dormitory
floor
a
few
bold
spirits
crept
up
to
look
and
received
boots
about
the
head
from
the
criminals
we
got
him
got
him
on
the
caudine
said
stalky
after
those
hints
were
taken
king
have
to
prove
his
charges
up
to
the
giddy
too
much
ticklee
him
bust
beetle
quoted
from
a
book
of
his
reading
did

o
ye

here
our
dear
friend
foxy
more
tortures
foxibus
i
brought
you
something
to
eat
young
gentlemen
said
the
sergeant
from
behind
a
crowded
tray
their
wars
had
ever
been
waged
without
malice
and
a
suspicion
floated
in
foxy
mind
that
boys
who
allowed
themselves
to
be
tracked
so
easily
might
perhaps
hold
something
in
reserve
foxy
had
served
through
the
mutiny
when
early
and
accurate
information
was
worth
much
i
i
noticed
you
anything
to
eat
an
i
spoke
to
gumbly
he
said

this

a
very
serious
business
young

i
did

perhaps
but
there
might
be
something
on
your
side
which
you
had
said
to
king
or
prout
there
is
heaps
this
from
stalky
through
a
full
mouth
then
you
see
if
that
was
the
case
it
seemed
to
me
i
might
represent
it
quiet
so
to
say
to
the
when
he
asks
me
about
it
i
got
to

or

that
effect

dismissed
with
a
reprimand
foxy
wo
tell
about
i
swear
we
wo
mcturk
concluded
bad
for
the
discipline
of
the
school
horrid
well
said
the
sergeant
gathering
up
the
knowin
what
i
know
o
the
young
dev
gentlemen
of
the
college
i
very
glad
to
it
but
what
am
i
to
tell
the
anything
you
jolly
well
please
foxy
we
are
the
to
say
that
the
head
was
annoyed
when
the
sergeant
appeared
after
dinner
with
the
day
would
be
putting
it
mildly
corkran
mcturk
and
i
see
bounds
as
usual
hullo
what
the
deuce
is
this
suspicion
of
drinking
whose
charge
mr
king
sir
i
caught
out
of
bounds
sir
at
least
that
was
it
looked
but
there
a
lot
the
sergeant
was
evidently
troubled
go
on
said
the
head
let
us
have
your
he
and
the
sergeant
had
dealt
with
one
another
for
some
seven
years
and
the
head
knew
that
king
statements
depended
very
largely
on
king
temper
i
thought
they
were
out
of
bounds
along
the
cliffs
but
it
come
out
they
was
sir
i
saw
them
go
into
colonel
dabney
woods
and
king
and
prout
come
along
and
the
fact
was
sir
we
was
mistook
for
poachers
by
colonel
dabney
people
king
and
prout
and
me
there
were
some
words
sir
on
both
sides
the
young
gentlemen
slipped
somehow
and
they
seemed
humorous
sir
king
was
mistook
by
colonel
dabney
himself
colonel
dabney
bein
strict
then
they
preferred
to
come
straight
to
you
sir
on
account
of
what
what
king
may
said
about
their
afterwards
in
prout
study
i
only
said
they
was
humorous
laughin
an
gigglin
an
a
bit
above
they
since
told
me
sir
in
a
humorous
way
that
they
was
invited
by
colonel
dabney
to
go
into
i
see
they
did
tell
their
that
of
course
they
took
up
king
on
appeal
just
as
soon
as
he
spoke
about
their
put
in
the
appeal
at
once
sir
an
asked
to
be
sent
to
the
dormitory
waitin
for
you
i
since
gathered
sir
in
their
humorous
way
sir
that
or
other
they
about
every
word
colonel
dabney
said
to
king
and
prout
when
he
mistook
for
poachers
i
i
might
ha
known
when
they
led
me
on
so
that
they
the
inner
line
of
communications
it
it
a
plain
do
sir
if
you
ask
me
an
they
gloatin
over
it
in
the
the
head
saw
saw
even
to
the
uttermost
farthing
and
his
mouth
twitched
a
little
under
his
mustache
send
them
to
me
at
once
sergeant
this
case
need
wait
good
evening
said
he
when
the
three
appeared
under
escort
i
want
your
undivided
attention
for
a
few
minutes
you
known
me
for
five
years
and
i
known
you
for
i
think
we
understand
one
another
perfectly
i
am
now
going
to
pay
you
a
tremendous
compliment
the
brown
one
please
sergeant
thanks
you
need
wait
i
going
to
execute
you
without
rhyme
beetle
or
reason
i
know
you
went
to
colonel
dabney
covers
because
you
were
invited
i
not
even
going
to
send
the
sergeant
with
a
note
to
ask
if
your
statement
is
true
because
i
am
convinced
that
on
this
occasion
you
have
adhered
strictly
to
the
truth
i
know
too
that
you
were
not
drinking
you
can
take
off
that
virtuous
expression
mcturk
or
i
shall
begin
to
fear
you
understand
me
there
is
not
a
flaw
in
any
of
your
characters
and
that
is
why
i
am
going
to
perpetrate
a
howling
injustice
your
reputations
have
been
injured
have
they
you
have
been
disgraced
before
the
house
have
you
you
have
a
peculiarly
keen
regard
for
the
honor
of
your
house
have
you
well
now
i
am
going
to
lick
six
apiece
was
their
portion
upon
that
word
and
this
i
think
the
head
replaced
the
cane
and
flung
the
written
charge
into
the
basket
covers
the
situation
when
you
find
a
variation
from
the
normal
this
will
be
useful
to
you
in
later
life
always
meet
him
in
an
abnormal
way
and
that
reminds
me
there
are
a
pile
of
on
that
shelf
you
can
borrow
them
if
you
put
them
back
i
do
think
they
take
any
harm
from
being
read
in
the
open
they
smell
of
tobacco
rather
you
will
go
to
prep
this
evening
as
usual
said
that
amazing
man
and
thank
you
i
swear
i
pray
for
the
head
said
beetle
those
last
two
cuts
were
just
flicks
on
my
collar
there
a
cristo
in
that
lower
shelf
i
saw
it
bags
i
next
time
we
go
to
aves
dearr
man
said
mcturk
no
gating
no
impots
no
beastly
questions
all
settled
hullo
what
king
goin
in
to
him
for
king
and
prout
whatever
the
nature
of
that
interview
it
did
not
improve
either
or
prout
ruffled
plumes
for
when
they
came
out
of
the
head
house
eyes
noted
that
the
one
was
red
and
blue
with
emotion
as
to
his
nose
and
that
the
other
was
sweating
profusely
that
sight
compensated
them
amply
for
the
imperial
jaw
with
which
they
were
favored
by
the
two
it
seems
and
who
so
astonished
as
they
that
they
had
held
back
material
facts
were
guilty
both
of
and
gods
against
whom
they
often
offended
further
that
they
were
malignant
in
their
dispositions
untrustworthy
in
their
characters
pernicious
and
revolutionary
in
their
influences
abandoned
to
the
devils
of
wilfulness
pride
and
a
most
intolerable
conceit
ninthly
and
lastly
they
were
to
have
a
care
and
to
be
very
careful
they
were
careful
as
only
boys
can
be
when
there
is
a
hurt
to
be
inflicted
they
waited
through
one
suffocating
week
till
prout
and
king
were
their
royal
selves
again
waited
till
there
was
a
their
own
house
too
in
which
prout
was
taking
part
waited
further
till
he
had
his
pads
in
the
pavilion
and
stood
ready
to
go
forth
king
was
scoring
at
the
window
and
the
three
sat
on
a
bench
without
said
stalky
to
beetle
i
say
beetle
custodet
ipsos

ask
me
said
beetle

these
are
all
rot
let
go
over
to
colonel
dabney
an
see
if
he
collared
any
more
that
afternoon
there
was
joy
in
aves
slaves
of
the
lamp
the
on
the
top
floor
of
number
five
was
filled
with
the
aladdin
company
at
rehearsal
dickson
quartus
commonly
known
as
dick
four
was
aladdin
half
the
orchestra
and
largely
librettist
for
the
book

been
rewritten
and
filled
with
local
allusions

pantomime
was
to
be
given
next
week
in
the
study
occupied
by
aladdin
abanazar
and
the

of
china
the
slave
of

with
the
princess
badroulbadour
and
the
widow

study
across
the
same
landing
so
that
the
company
could
be
easily
assembled
the
floor
shook
to
the
of
the
ballet
while
aladdin
in
pink
cotton
tights
a
blue
and
tinsel
jacket
and
a
plumed
hat
banged
alternately
on
the
piano
and
his
banjo
he
was
the
moving
spirit
of
the
game
as
befitted
a
senior
who
had
passed
his
army
preliminary
and
hoped
to
enter
sandhurst
next
spring
aladdin
came
to
his
own
at
last
abanazar
lay
poisoned
on
the
floor
the
widow
twankay
danced
her
dance
and
the
company
decided
it
would
come
all
right
on
the
what
about
the
last
song
though
said
the
emperor
a
tallish
boy
with
a
ghost
of
a
mustache
at
which
he
pulled
manfully

a
rousing
old
peel
puppy

suggested
abanazar
smoothing
his
baggy
lilac
pajamas
pussy
abanazar
never
looked
more
than
awake
but
he
owned
a
soft
slow
smile
which
well
suited
the
part
of
the
wicked
uncle
stale
said
aladdin

as
well
have
clock

thing

humming
at

the

on
the
top
of
the
piano
it
was
a
catchy
tune
dick
four
cocked
his
head
critically
and

large
red

slantwise
above
a
pair
of
spectacles
mended
with
an
old
represented
the

hurry
up
mcturk
in
a
violet
silk
skirt
and
a
coquettish
blue
turban
slouched
forward
as
one
thoroughly
ashamed
of
himself
the
slave
of
the
lamp
climbed
down
from
the
piano
and
dispassionately
kicked
him
play
up
turkey
he
said
this
is
but
there
fell
on
the
door
the
knock
of
authority
it
happened
to
be
king
in
gown
and
enjoying
a
saturday
evening
prowl
before
dinner
locked
doors
locked
doors
he
snapped
with
a
scowl
what
the
meaning
of
this
and
what
may
i
ask
is
the
intention
of
this
this
epicene
attire
pantomime
sir
the
head
gave
us
leave
said
abanazar
as
the
only
member
of
the
sixth
concerned
dick
four
stood
firm
in
the
confidence
born
of
tights
but
beetle
strove
to
efface
himself
behind
the
piano
a
gray
borrowed
from
a
mother
and
a
spotted
cotton
bodice
unsystematically
padded
with
make
one
ridiculous
and
in
other
regards
beetle
had
a
bad
conscience
as
usual
sneered
king
futile
foolery
just
when
your
careers
such
as
they
may
be
are
hanging
in
the
balance
i
see
ah
i
see
the
old
gang
of
criminals
allied
forces
of
disorder
corkran
the
slave
of
the
lamp
smiled
politely
mcturk
the
irishman
scowled
and
of
course
the
unspeakable
beetle
our
friend
abanazar
the
emperor
and
aladdin
had
more
or
less
of
characters
and
king
passed
them
over
come
forth
my
inky
buffoon
from
behind
yonder
instrument
of
music
you
supply
i
presume
the
doggerel
for
this
entertainment
esteem
yourself
to
be
as
it
were
a
poet
he
found
one
of
thought
beetle
noting
the
flush
on
i
have
just
had
the
pleasure
of
reading
an
effusion
of
yours
to
my
address
i
believe
an
effusion
intended
to
rhyme
so
so
you
despise
me
master
gigadibs
do
you
i
am
quite
aware
you
need
not
explain
that
it
was
ostensibly
not
intended
for
my
edification
i
read
it
with
laughter
yes
with
laughter
these
paper
pellets
of
inky
boys
still
a
boy
we
are
master
gigadibs
do
not
disturb
my
wonder
which
it
was
thought
beetle
he
had
launched
many
lampoons
on
an
appreciative
public
ever
since
he
discovered
that
it
was
possible
to
convey
reproof
in
rhyme
in
sign
of
his
unruffled
calm
king
proceeded
to
tear
beetle
whom
he
called
gigadibs
slowly
asunder
from
his
untied
shoestrings
to
his
mended
spectacles
the
life
of
a
poet
at
a
big
school
is
hard
he
held
him
up
to
the
derision
of
his
associates
with
the
usual
result
his
wild
flowers
of
speech
king
had
an
unpleasant
tongue
him
to
good
humor
at
the
last
he
drew
a
lurid
picture
of
beetle
latter
end
as
a
scurrilous
pamphleteer
dying
in
an
attic
scattered
a
few
compliments
over
mcturk
and
corkran
and
reminding
beetle
that
he
must
come
up
for
judgment
when
called
upon
went
to
where
he
triumphed
anew
over
his
victims
and
the
worst
of
it
he
explained
in
a
loud
voice
over
his
soup
is
that
i
waste
such
gems
of
sarcasm
on
their
thick
heads
it
miles
above
them
i
said
the
school
chaplain
slowly
i
do
know
what
appreciation
of
your
style
may
be
but
young
mcturk
reads
ruskin
for
his
nonsense
he
does
it
to
show
off
i
mistrust
the
dark
he
does
nothing
of
the
kind
i
went
into
their
study
the
other
night
unofficially
and
mcturk
was
gluing
up
the
back
of
four
odd
numbers
of
clavigera
i
do
know
anything
about
their
private
lives
said
a
mathematical
master
hotly
but
i
learned
by
bitter
experience
that
number
five
study
are
best
left
alone
they
are
utterly
soulless
young
he
blushed
as
the
others
laughed
but
in
the
there
were
wrath
and
bad
language
only
stalky
slave
of
the
lamp
lay
on
the
piano
unmoved
that
little
swine
manders
miner
must
have
shown
him
your
stuff
always
suckin
up
to
king
go
and
kill
him
he
drawled
which
one
was
it
beetle
dunno
said
beetle
struggling
out
of
the
skirt
there
was
one
about
his
hunting
for
popularity
with
the
small
boys
and
the
other
one
was
one
about
him
in
hell
tellin
the
devil
he
was
a
balliol
man
i
swear
both
of
rhymed
all
right
by
gum
manders
minor
showed
him
both
correct
his
caesuras
for
he
disappeared
down
two
flights
of
stairs
flushed
a
small
pink
and
white
boy
in
a
next
door
to
king
study
which
again
was
immediately
below
his
own
and
chased
him
up
the
corridor
into
a
sacred
to
the
revels
of
the
lower
third
thence
he
came
back
greatly
disordered
to
find
mcturk
stalky
and
the
others
of
the
company
in
his
study
enjoying
an
unlimited
brew
coffee
cocoa

new
bread

and
steaming

at

he
throwing
himself
upon
the
banquet
who
stumped
up
for
this
stalky
it
was
within
a
month
of
term
end
and
blank
starvation
had
reigned
in
the
studies
for
weeks
you
said
stalky
serenely
confound

you
have
been
popping
my
sunday
bags
then
keep
your
hair
on
it
only
your
watch
i
lost
it
weeks
ago
out
on
the
burrows
when
we
tried
to
shoot
the
old
ram
the
day
our
pistol
it
dropped
out
of
your
pocket
you
so
beastly
careless
beetle
and
mcturk
and
i
kept
it
for
you
i
been
wearing
it
for
a
week
and
you
never
noticed

it
into
bideford
after
dinner

sevenpence

said
abanazar
behind
a
slab
of
cream
and
jam
as
beetle
reassured
upon
the
safety
of
his
sunday
trousers
showed
not
even
surprise
much
less
resentment
indeed
it
was
mcturk
who
grew
angry
saying
you
gave
him
the
ticket
stalky
you
pawned
it
you
unmitigated
beast
why
last
month
you
and
beetle
sold
mine
got
a
sniff
of
any
ah
that
was
because
you
locked
your
trunk
and
we
wasted
half
the
afternoon
hammering
it
open
we
might
have
pawned
it
if
you
behaved
like
a
christian
my
aunt
said
abanazar
you
chaps
are
communists
vote
of
thanks
to
beetle
that
beastly
unfair
said
stalky
when
i
took
all
the
trouble
to
pawn
it
beetle
never
knew
he
had
a
watch
oh
i
say
gave
me
a
lift
into
bideford
this
was
the
local
carrier
an
outcrop
of
the
early
devonian
formation
it
was
stalky
who
had
invented
his
unlovely
name
he
was
pretty
average
drunk
or
he
would
have
done
it
is
a
little
shy
of
me
somehow
but
i
swore
it
was
between
us
and
gave
him
a
bob
he
stopped
at
two
pubs
on
the
way
in
so
he
be
howling
drunk
oh
do
begin
reading
beetle
there
a
council
of
war
on
what
the
deuce
is
the
matter
with
your
collar
manders
minor
into
the
lower
third
all
his
beastly
little
friends
on
top
of
me
said
beetle
from
behind
a
jar
of
pilchards
and
a
book
you
ass
any
fool
could
have
told
you
where
manders
would
bunk
to
said
mcturk
i
did
think
said
beetle
meekly
scooping
out
pilchards
with
a
spoon
course
you
did
you
never
mcturk
adjusted
beetle
collar
with
a
savage
tug
do
drop
oil
all
over
my
or
i
scrag
you
shut
up
you
you
irish
biddy
is
your
beastly
it
one
of
the
book
was
a
fat
volume
of
the
later
sixties
which
king
had
once
thrown
at
beetle
head
that
beetle
might
see
whence
the
name
gigadibs
came
beetle
had
quietly
annexed
the
book
and
had
seen
several
things
the
verses
lived
and
ate
with
him
as
the
bedropped
pages
showed
he
removed
himself
from
all
that
world
drifting
at
large
with
wondrous
men
and
women
till
mcturk
hammered
the
pilchard
spoon
on
his
head
and
he
snarled
beetle
you
oppressed
and
insulted
and
bullied
by
king
do
you
feel
it
let
me
alone
i
can
write
some
more
poetry
about
him
if
i
am
i
mad
quite
mad
said
stalky
to
the
visitors
as
one
exhibiting
strange
beasts
beetle
reads
an
ass
called
brownin
and
mcturk
reads
an
ass
called
ruskin
and
ruskin
is
an
ass
said
mcturk
he
almost
as
good
as
the
opium
eater
he
says
children
of
noble
races
trained
by
surrounding
art
that
means
and
the
way
i
decorated
the
study
when
you
two
badgers
would
have
stuck
up
brackets
and
christmas
cards
child
of
a
noble
race
trained
by
surrounding
art
stop
reading
or
i
shove
a
pilchard
down
your
neck
it
two
to
one
said
stalky
warningly
and
beetle
closed
the
book
in
obedience
to
the
law
under
which
he
and
his
companions
had
lived
for
six
checkered
years
the
visitors
looked
on
delighted
number
five
study
had
a
reputation
for
more
variegated
insanity
than
the
rest
of
the
school
put
together
and
so
far
as
its
code
allowed
friendship
with
outsiders
it
was
polite
and
to
its
neighbors
on
the
same
landing
what
rot
do
you
want
now
said
beetle
king
war
said
mcturk
jerking
his
head
toward
the
wall
where
hung
a
small
wooden
a
gift
to
mcturk
from
a
naval
uncle
then
we
shall
be
turned
out
of
the
study
again
said
beetle
who
loved
his
mason
turned
us
out
for
just
warbling
on
mason
was
the
mathematical
master
who
had
testified
in
warbling
o
lord
said
abanazar
we
could
hear
ourselves
speak
in
our
study
when
you
played
the
infernal
thing
what
the
good
of
getting
turned
out
of
your
study
anyhow
we
lived
in
the
for
a
week
too
said
beetle
tragically
and
it
was
beastly
but
mason
rooms
were
filled
with
rats
every
day
we
were
out
it
took
him
a
week
to
draw
the
inference
said
mcturk
he
loathes
rats
he
let
us
go
back
the
rats
stopped
mason
a
little
shy
of
us
now
but
there
was
no
jolly
well
there
was
said
stalky
when
i
got
out
on
the
roof
and
dropped
the
beastly
things
down
his
chimney
but
look
here
question
is
are
our
characters
good
enough
just
now
to
stand
a
study
row
never
mind
mine
said
beetle
king
swears
i
have
i
not
thinking
of
you
stalky
returned
scornfully
you
going
up
for
the
army
you
old
bat
i
do
want
to
be
expelled
and
the
head
getting
rather
shy
of
us
rot
said
mcturk
the
head
never
expels
except
for
beastliness
or
stealing
but
i
forgot
you
and
stalky
thieves
regular
the
visitors
gasped
but
stalky
interpreted
the
parable
with
large
grins
well
you
know
that
little
beast
manders
minor
saw
beetle
and
me
hammerin
mcturk
trunk
open
in
the
dormitory
when
we
took
his
watch
last
month
of
course
manders
sneaked
to
mason
and
mason
solemnly
took
it
up
as
a
case
of
theft
to
get
even
with
us
about
the
that
just
put
mason
into
our
giddy
hands
said
mcturk
blandly
we
were
nice
to
him
because
he
was
a
new
master
and
wanted
to
win
the
confidence
of
the
boys
he
draws
inferences
though
stalky
went
to
his
study
and
pretended
to
blub
and
told
mason
he
lead
a
new
life
if
mason
would
let
him
off
this
time
but
mason
would
it
was
his
duty
to
report
him
to
the
vindictive
swine
said
beetle
it
was
all
those
rats
then
blubbed
too
and
stalky
confessed
that
he
been
a
thief
in
regular
practice
for
six
years
ever
since
he
came
to
the
school
and
that
taught
him
fagin
mason
turned
white
with
joy
he
thought
he
had
us
on
gorgeous
gorgeous
said
dick
four
we
never
heard
of
not
mason
kept
it
jolly
quiet
he
wrote
down
all
our
statements
on
there
was
anything
he
would
believe
said
stalky
and
handed
it
all
up
to
the
head
an
extempore
prayer
it
took
about
forty
pages
said
beetle
i
helped
him
a
and
then
you
crazy
idiots
said
abanazar
oh
we
were
sent
for
and
stalky
asked
to
have
the
read
out
and
the
head
knocked
him
spinning
into
a
basket
then
he
gave
us
eight
cuts
apiece
welters
for
for
takin
liberties
with
a
new
master
i
saw
his
shoulders
shaking
when
we
went
out
do
you
know
said
beetle
pensively
that
mason
ca
look
at
us
now
in
second
lesson
without
blushing
we
three
stare
at
him
sometimes
till
he
regularly
trickles
he
an
awfully
sensitive
he
read
or
little
by
little
said
mcturk
so
we
gave
him
winifred
or
the
world
of
school
they
spent
all
their
spare
time
stealing
at
winifred
when
they
were
praying
or
getting
drunk
at
pubs
well
that
was
only
a
week
ago
and
the
head
a
little
bit
shy
of
us
he
called
it
constructive
deviltry
stalky
invented
it
not
the
least
good
having
a
row
with
a
master
unless
you
can
make
an
ass
of
him
said
stalky
extended
at
ease
on
the
if
mason
did
know
number
five
well
he
learnt
that
all
now
my
dearly
beloved
stalky
curled
his
legs
under
him
and
addressed
the
company
we
got
that
strong
perseverin
man
king
on
our
hands
he
went
miles
out
of
his
way
to
provoke
a
here
stalky
snapped
down
the
black
silk
domino
and
assumed
the
air
of
a
judge
he
has
oppressed
beetle
mcturk
and
me
et
one
by
one
as
he
could
catch
us
but
now
he
has
insulted
number
five
up
in
the
and
in
the
presence
of
these
these
ossifers
of
the
wot
look
like
hairdressers
binjimin
we
must
make
him
cry
stalky
reading
did
not
include
browning
or
ruskin
and
besides
said
mcturk
he
a
philistine
a
he
wears
a
tartan
tie
ruskin
says
that
any
man
who
wears
a
tartan
tie
will
without
doubt
be
damned
bravo
mcturk
said
tertius
i
thought
he
was
only
a
he
that
too
of
course
but
he
worse
he
has
a
china
basket
with
blue
ribbons
and
a
pink
kitten
on
it
hung
up
in
his
window
to
grow
musk
in
you
know
when
i
got
all
that
old
oak
carvin
out
of
bideford
church
when
they
were
restoring
it
ruskin
says
that
any
man
who
restore
a
church
is
an
unmitigated
sweep
and
stuck
it
up
here
with
glue
well
king
came
in
and
wanted
to
know
whether
we
done
it
with
a
yah
he
is
the
king
of
down
went
mcturk
inky
thumb
over
an
imaginary
arena
full
of
bleeding
kings
child
of
a
generous
race
he
cried
to
beetle
well
began
beetle
doubtfully
he
comes
from
balliol
but
i
going
to
give
the
beast
a
chance
you
see
i
can
always
make
him
hop
with
some
more
poetry
he
ca
report
me
to
the
head
because
it
makes
him
ridiculous
stalky
quite
right
but
he
shall
have
his
beetle
opened
the
book
on
the
table
ran
his
finger
down
a
page
and
began
at
random
or
who
in
moscow
toward
the
czar
with
the
demurest
of
footfalls
over
the
kremlin
pavement
white
with
serpentine
and
syenite
steps
with
five
other
generals
that
no
good
try
another
said
stalky
hold
on
a
shake
i
know
what
mcturk
was
reading
over
beetle
shoulder
that
simultaneously
take
snuff
for
each
to
have
pretext
enough
and
kerchiefwise
unfold
his
sash
which
softness
self
is
yet
the
stuff
gummy
what
a
sentence
to
hold
fast
where
a
steel
chain
snaps
and
leave
the
grand
white
neck
no
gash
full
stop
understand
a
word
of
it
said
stalky
more
fool
you
construe
said
mcturk
those
six
bargees
scragged
the
czar
and
left
no
evidence
with
he
gave
me
that
book
too
said
beetle
licking
his
lips
there
a
great
text
in
galatians
once
you
trip
on
it
entails
distinct
damnations
one
sure
if
another
then
irrelevantly
setebos
setebos
and
setebos
thinketh

in
the

of

said
dick
four
looking
through
the
window
manders
minor
is
with
place
for
manders
minor
just
now
said
beetle
then
you
chaps
had
better
clear
out
said
stalky
politely
to
the
visitors
is
fair
to
mix
you
up
in
a
study
row
besides
we
afford
to
have
are
you
going
to
begin
at
once
said
aladdin
immediately
if
not
sooner
said
stalky
and
turned
out
the
gas
strong
perseverin
man
king
make
him
cry
the
company
retreated
to
their
own
neat
and
spacious
study
with
expectant
souls
when
stalky
blows
out
his
nostrils
like
a
horse
said
aladdin
to
the
emperor
of
china
he
on
the
what
king
will
beans
said
the
emperor
number
five
generally
pays
in
wonder
if
i
ought
to
take
any
notice
of
it
officially
said
abanazar
who
had
just
remembered
he
was
a
prefect
it
none
of
your
business
pussy
besides
if
you
did
we
have
them
hostile
to
us
and
we
should
be
able
to
do
any
work
said
aladdin
they
begun
now
that
had
been
made
to
signal
across
estuaries
and
deltas
number
five
was
forbidden
to
wake
the
engine
within
earshot
of
the
school
but
a
deep
devastating
drone
filled
the
passages
as
mcturk
and
beetle
scientifically
rubbed
its
top
anon
it
changed
to
the
blare
of
trumpets
of
savage
pursuing
trumpets
then
as
mcturk
slapped
one
side
smooth
with
the
blood
of
ancient
sacrifice
the
roar
broke
into
short
coughing
howls
such
as
the
wounded
gorilla
throws
in
his
native
forest
these
were
followed
by
the
wrath
of
king
three
steps
at
a
time
up
the
staircase
with
a
dry
whir
of
the
gown
aladdin
and
company
listening
squeaked
with
excitement
as
the
door
crashed
open
king
stumbled
into
the
darkness
and
cursed
those
performers
by
the
gods
of
balliol
and
quiet
repose
turned
out
for
a
week
said
aladdin
holding
the
study
door
on
the
crack
key
to
be
brought
down
to
his
study
in
five
minutes
barbarians
savages
children
he
rather
agitated
patsy
mind
the
baby
he
sang
in
a
whisper
as
he
clung
to
the
dancing
a
noiseless
king
went
again
and
beetle
and
mcturk
lit
the
gas
to
confer
with
stalky
but
stalky
had
vanished
looks
like
no
end
of
a
mess
said
beetle
collecting
his
books
and
mathematical
instrument
case
a
week
in
the
is
any
advantage
to
yes
but
do
you
see
that
stalky
is
here
you
owl
said
mcturk
take
down
the
key
and
look
sorrowful
king
only
jaw
you
for
half
an
hour
i
going
to
read
in
the
lower
but
it
always
me
mourned
beetle
wait
till
we
see
said
mcturk
hopefully
i
do
know
any
more
than
you
do
what
stalky
means
but
it
something
go
down
and
draw
fire
you
used
to
no
sooner
had
the
key
turned
in
the
door
than
the
lid
of
the
which
was
also
the
lifted
cautiously
it
had
been
a
tight
fit
even
for
the
lithe
stalky
his
head
between
his
knees
and
his
stomach
under
his
right
ear
from
a
drawer
in
the
table
he
took
a
catapult
a
handful
of
buckshot
and
a
duplicate
key
of
the
study
noiselessly
he
raised
the
window
and
kneeled
by
it
his
face
turned
to
the
road
the
trees
the
dark
levels
of
the
burrows
and
the
white
line
of
breakers
falling
along
the
pebbleridge
far
down
the
devonshire
lane
he
heard
the
husky
hoot
of
the
carrier
horn
there
was
a
ghost
of
melody
in
it
as
it
might
have
been
the
wind
in
a
essaying
to
sing
it
a
way
we
have
in
the
stalky
smiled
a
smile
and
at
extreme
range
opened
fire
the
old
horse
half
wheeled
in
the
shafts
where
he
gwaine
tu
hiccoughed
another
buckshot
tore
through
the
rotten
canvas
tilt
with
a
vicious
zipp
murmured
stalky
as
swore
into
the
patient
night
protesting
that
he
saw
the
dommed
colleger
who
was
assaulting
him
and
so
king
was
saying
in
a
high
head
voice
to
beetle
whom
he
had
kept
to
play
with
before
manders
minor
well
knowing
that
it
hurts
a
boy
to
be
held
up
to
a
fag
derision
and
so
master
beetle
in
spite
of
all
our
verses
which
we
are
so
proud
of
when
we
presume
to
come
into
direct
conflict
with
even
so
humble
a
representative
of
authority
as
myself
for
instance
we
are
turned
out
of
our
studies
are
we
not
yes
sir
said
beetle
with
a
sheepish
grin
on
his
lips
and
murder
in
his
heart
hope
had
nearly
left
him
but
he
clung
to
a
faith
that
never
was
stalky
so
dangerous
as
when
he
was
invisible
you
are
required
to
criticise
thank
you
turned
out
of
our
studies
we
are
just
as
if
we
were
no
better
than
little
manders
minor
only
inky
schoolboys
we
are
and
must
be
treated
as
beetle
pricked
up
his
ears
for
was
swearing
savagely
on
the
road
and
some
of
the
language
entered
at
the
upper
sash
king
believed
in
ventilation
he
strode
to
the
window
gowned
and
majestic
very
visible
in
the
gaslight
i
zee
i
zee
roared
now
that
he
had
found
a
visible
foe
another
shot
from
the
darkness
above
yiss
yeou
yeou
beggar
yeu
tu
old
for
such
goin
on
aie
poultice
yeour
nose
i
tall
poultice
yeour
long
nose
beetle
heart
leaped
up
within
him
somewhere
somehow
he
knew
stalky
moved
behind
these
manifestations
there
were
hope
and
the
prospect
of
revenge
he
would
embody
the
suggestion
about
the
nose
in
deathless
verse
king
threw
up
the
window
and
sternly
rebuked
but
the
carrier
was
beyond
fear
or
fawning
he
had
descended
from
the
cart
and
was
stooping
by
the
roadside
it
all
fell
swiftly
as
a
dream
manders
minor
raised
his
hand
to
his
head
with
a
cry
as
a
jagged
flint
cannoned
on
to
some
rich
bindings
in
the
another
quoited
along
the
beetle
made
zealous
feint
to
stop
it
and
in
that
endeavor
overturned
a
student
lamp
which
dripped
king
papers
and
some
choice
books
greasily
on
to
a
persian
rug
there
was
much
broken
glass
on
the
the
china
basket
mcturk
aversion
cracked
to
flinders
had
dropped
her
musk
plant
and
its
earth
over
the
red
rep
cushions
manders
minor
was
bleeding
profusely
from
a
cut
on
the
and
king
using
strange
words
every
one
of
which
beetle
treasured
ran
forth
to
find
the
that
might
be
instantly
cast
into
jail
poor
chap
said
beetle
with
a
false
feigned
sympathy
let
it
bleed
a
little
that
prevent
apoplexy
and
he
held
the
blind
head
skilfully
over
the
table
and
the
papers
on
the
table
as
he
guided
the
howling
manders
to
the
door
then
did
beetle
alone
with
the
wreckage
return
good
for
evil
how
in
that
office
a
complete
set
of
gibbon
was
scarred
all
along
the
back
as
by
a
flint
how
so
much
black
and
copying
ink
came
to
be
mingled
with
manders
gore
on
the
why
the
big
unstoppered
had
rolled
semicircularly
across
the
floor
and
in
what
manner
the
white
china
grew
to
be
painted
with
yet
more
of
manders
young
blood
were
matters
which
beetle
did
not
explain
when
the
rabid
king
returned
to
find
him
standing
politely
over
the
reeking
you
never
told
me
to
go
sir
he
said
with
the
air
of
casabianca
and
king
consigned
him
to
the
outer
darkness
but
it
was
to
a
under
the
staircase
on
the
ground
floor
that
he
hastened
to
loose
the
mirth
that
was
destroying
him
he
had
not
drawn
breath
for
a
first
whoop
of
triumph
when
two
hands
choked
him
dumb
go
to
the
dormitory
and
get
me
my
things
bring
to
number
five
lavatory
i
still
in
tights
hissed
stalky
sitting
on
his
head
do
run
but
beetle
staggered
into
the
next
door
and
delegated
his
duty
to
the
yet
unenlightened
mcturk
with
an
hysterical
precis
of
the
campaign
thus
far
so
it
was
mcturk
of
the
wooden
visage
who
brought
the
clothes
from
the
dormitory
while
beetle
panted
on
a
form
then
the
three
buried
themselves
in
number
five
lavatory
turned
on
all
the
taps
filled
the
place
with
steam
and
dropped
weeping
into
the
baths
where
they
pieced
out
the
war
gasped
stalky
i
waited
till
i
could
hear
myself
think
while
you
played
the
drum
hid
in
the
and
tweaked
and
rocked
king
was
it
beautiful
did
you
hear
the
glass
why
he
he
he
shrieked
mcturk
one
trembling
finger
pointed
at
beetle
why
i
i
i
was
through
it
all
beetle
howled
in
his
study
being
oh
my
soul
said
stalky
with
a
yell
disappearing
under
water
the
the
glass
was
nothing
manders
minor
head
cut
open
la
la
lamp
upset
all
over
the
rug
blood
on
the
books
and
papers
the
gum
the
gum
the
gum
the
ink
the
ink
the
ink
oh
lord
then
stalky
leaped
out
all
pink
as
he
was
and
shook
beetle
into
some
sort
of
coherence
but
his
tale
prostrated
them
afresh
i
bunked
for
the
the
second
i
heard
king
go
beetle
tumbled
in
on
top
of
me
the
spare
key
hid
behind
the
loose
board
there
is
a
shadow
of
evidence
said
stalky
they
were
all
chanting
together
and
he
turned
us
out
himself
himself
himself
this
from
mcturk
he
ca
begin
to
suspect
us
oh
stalky
it
the
loveliest
thing
ever
gum
gum
dollops
of
gum
shouted
beetle
his
spectacles
gleaming
through
a
sea
of
lather
ink
and
blood
all
mixed
i
held
the
little
beast
head
all
over
the
latin
proses
for
monday
golly
how
the
oil
stunk
and
told
king
to
poultice
his
nose
did
you
hit
stalky
did
i
jolly
well
not
tweaked
him
all
over
did
you
hear
him
curse
oh
i
shall
be
sick
in
a
minute
if
i
do
but
dressing
was
a
slow
process
because
mcturk
was
obliged
to
dance
when
he
heard
that
the
musk
basket
was
broken
and
moreover
beetle
retailed
all
king
language
with
emendations
and
purple
insets
shockin
said
stalky
collapsing
in
a
helpless
welter
of
trousers
so
dam
bad
too
for
innocent
boys
like
us
wonder
what
they
say
at
winifred
or
the
world
of
school
by
gum
that
reminds
me
we
owe
the
lower
third
one
for
assaultin
beetle
when
he
chivied
manders
minor
come
on
it
an
alibi
samivel
and
besides
if
we
let
off
they
be
worse
next
the
lower
third
had
set
a
guard
upon
their
for
the
space
of
a
full
hour
which
to
a
boy
is
a
lifetime
now
they
were
busy
with
their
saturday
evening
businesses
cooking
sparrows
over
the
gas
with
rusty
nibs
brewing
unholy
drinks
in
gallipots
skinning
moles
with
attending
to
paper
trays
full
of
silkworms
or
discussing
the
iniquities
of
their
elders
with
a
freedom
fluency
and
point
that
would
have
amazed
their
parents
the
blow
fell
without
warning
stalky
upset
a
form
crowded
with
small
boys
among
their
own
cooking
utensils
mcturk
raided
the
untidy
lockers
as
a
terrier
digs
at
a
while
beetle
poured
ink
upon
such
heads
as
he
could
not
appeal
to
with
a
smith
classical
dictionary
three
brisk
minutes
accounted
for
many
silkworms
pet
larvae
french
exercises
school
caps
bones
and
skulls
and
a
dozen
pots
of
sloe
jam
it
was
a
great
wreckage
and
the
looked
as
though
three
conflicting
tempests
had
smitten
it
phew
said
stalky
drawing
breath
outside
the
door
amid
groans
of
oh
you
beastly
you
think
yourselves
awful
funny
and
so
forth
all
right
never
let
the
sun
go
down
upon
your
wrath
rummy
little
devils
fags
got
no

o

i
warned
what
they
get
everybody
paid
in
full
beautiful
feelin
said
mcturk
absently
as
they
strolled
along
the
corridor
do
think
we
better
say
much
about
king
though
do
you
stalky
not
our
line
is
injured
innocence
of
course
same
as
when
the
sergeant
reported
us
on
suspicion
of
smoking
in
the
bunkers
if
i
thought
of
buyin
the
pepper
and
spillin
it
all
over
our
clothes
he
have
smelt
us
king
was
facetious
about
that
us
in
form
for
a
ah

natural
history
society
because
little
hartopp
is
president

do
anything

said
mcturk
but
he
must
be
a
putrid
ass

birds
like
poor
old
king

beetle
he
unpopular
in
and
they
chaff
his
head
off
about
golly
how
lovely
how
beautiful
how
holy
but
you
should
have
seen
his
face
when
the
first
rock
came
in
the
earth
from
the
basket
so
they
were
all
stricken
helpless
for
five
minutes
they
repaired
at
last
to
abanazar
study
and
were
received
reverently
what
the
matter
said
stalky
quick
to
realize
new
atmospheres

abanazar

in
a
loud
and
cheerful
voice
as

stairs

shadow
of

wall

only
a
bit
drunk
swearin
at
his
horse
and

jawed
him
through
the
window
and

rocked

and
every

staircase
like

a
bargee

to
tie
my
the
other
study
hurried
forward
they
did
not
wish
to
be
dragged
into
stage
asides
of
this
nature
so
it
was
left
to
mcturk
to
sum
up
the
situation
beneath
the
guns
of
the
enemy
you
see
said
the
irishman
hanging
on
the
banister
he
begins
by
bullying
little
chaps
then
he
bullies
the
big
chaps
then
he
bullies
some
one
who
is
connected
with
the
college
and
then
catches
it
serves
him
jolly
well
right
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
did
see
you
were
coming
down
the
the
black
gown
tore
past
like
a
and
in
its
wake
three
abreast
arms
linked
the
aladdin
company
rolled
up
the
big
corridor
to
prayers
singing
with
most
innocent
intention
arrah

an
unsavory
interlude
it
was
a
maiden
aunt
of
stalky
who
sent
him
both
books
with
the
inscription
to
dearest
artie
on
his
sixteenth
birthday
it
was
mcturk
who
ordered
their
hypothecation
and
it
was
beetle
returned
from
bideford
who
flung
them
on
the
of
number
five
study
with
news
that
bastable
would
advance
but
ninepence
on
the
two
eric
or
little
by

being
almost
as
great
a
drug
as
st
an
i
do
think
much
of
your
aunt
we
nearly
out
of
cartridges
too
artie
whereupon
stalky
rose
up
to
grapple
with
him
but
mcturk
sat
on
head
calling
him
a
boy
till
peace
was
declared
as
they
were
grievously
in
arrears
with
a
latin
prose
as
it
was
a
blazing
july
afternoon
and
as
they
ought
to
have
been
at
a
house
they
began
to
renew
their
acquaintance
intimate
and
unholy
with
the
volumes
here
we
are
said
mcturk
punishment
produced
on
eric
the
worst
effects
he
burned
with
remorse
or
regret
make
a
note
that
beetle
but
with
shame
and
violent
indignation
he
glared
oh
naughty
eric
let
get
to
where
he
goes
in
for
hold
on
half
a
shake
here
another
sample
sixth
he
says
the
palladium
of
all
public
schools
but
this
lot
stalky
rapped
the
gilded
book
ca
prevent
fellows
drinkin
and
stealin
an
fags
out
of
window
at
night
an
an
doin
what
they
please
golly
what
we
missed
not
goin
to
st
winifred
i
sorry
to
see
any
boys
of
my
house
taking
so
little
interest
in
their
prout
could
move
very
silently
if
he
pleased
though
that
is
no
merit
in
a
boy
eyes
he
had
flung
open
the
without
knocking
another
sin
and
looked
at
them
suspiciously
very
sorry
indeed
i
am
to
see
you
frowsting
in
your
we
been
out
ever
since
dinner
sir
said
mcturk
wearily
one
is
just
like
another
and
their
ploy
of
that
week
happened
to
be
with
i
ca
see
a
ball
when
it
coming
sir
said
beetle
i
had
my
smashed
at
the
nets
till
i
got
excused
i
was
any
good
even
as
a
fag
then
tuck
is
probably
your
form
tuck
and
brewing
why
ca
you
three
take
any
interest
in
the
honor
of
your
house
they
had
heard
that
phrase
till
they
were
wearied
the
honor
of
the
house
was
prout
weak
point
and
they
knew
well
how
to
flick
him
on
the
raw
if
you
order
us
to
go
down
sir
of
course
we
go
said
stalky
with
maddening
politeness
but
prout
knew
better
than
that
he
had
tried
the
experiment
once
at
a
big
match
when
the
three
stood
to
attention
for
half
an
hour
in
full
view
of
all
the
visitors
to
whom
fags
subsidized
for
that
end
pointed
them
out
as
victims
of
tyranny
and
prout
was
a
sensitive
man
in
the
infinitely
petty
confederacies
of
the
king
and
macrea
fellow
had
borne
it
in
upon
him
that
by
games
and
games
alone
was
salvation
wrought
boys
neglected
were
boys
lost
they
must
be
disciplined
left
to
himself
prout
would
have
made
a
sympathetic
but
he
was
never
so
left
and
with
the
devilish
insight
of
youth
the
boys
knew
to
whom
they
were
indebted
for
his
zeal
must
we
go
down
sir
said
mcturk
i
do
want
to
order
you
to
do
what
a
boy
should
do
gladly
i
and
he
lurched
out
with
some
hazy
impression
that
he
had
sown
good
seed
on
poor
ground
now
what
does
he
suppose
is
the
use
of
that
said
beetle
oh
he
cracked
king
jaws
him
in
about
not
keepin
us
up
to
the
mark
an
macrea
burbles
about
an
old
heffy
sits
between
sweatin
big
drops
i
heard
oke
the
butler
talking
to
richards
prout
about
it
down
in
the
basement
the
other
day
when
i
went
down
to
bag
some
bread
said
stalky
what
did
oke
say
demanded
mcturk
throwing
eric
into
a
corner
oh
he
said
make
more
nise
nor
a
nest
full
o
jackdaws
an
half
of
it
like
we
no
ears
to
our
heads
that
waited
on
they
talks
over
old
prout
what
he
done
an
left
undone
about
his
boys
an
how
their
boys
be
fine
boys
an
be
dom
bad
well
oke
talked
like
that
you
know
and
richards
got
wrathy
he
has
a
down
on
king
for
something
or
other
wonder
why
why
king
talks
about
prout
in
makes
allusions
an
all
that
only
half
the
chaps
are
such
asses
they
ca
see
what
drivin
at
and
remember
what
he
said
about
the
last
tuesday
he
meant
us
they
say
he
says
perfectly
beastly
things
to
his
own
house
making
fun
of
prout
said
beetle
well
we
did
come
here
to
mix
up
in
their
rows
mcturk
said
wrathfully
who
bathe
after
king
takin
it
in
the
come
turkey
seized
his
straw
and
led
the
way
they
reached
the
pavilion
over
against
the
gray
pebbleridge
just
before
and
asking
no
questions
gathered
from
king
voice
and
manner
that
his
house
was
on
the
road
to
victory
ah
ha
said
he
turning
to
show
the
light
of
his
countenance
here
we
have
the
ornaments
of
the
casual
house
at
last
you
consider
cricket
beneath
you
i
believe
the
crowd
flannelled
sniggered
and
from
what
i
have
seen
this
afternoon
i
fancy
many
others
of
your
house
hold
the
same
view
and
may
i
ask
what
you
purpose
to
do
with
your
noble
selves
till
going
down
to
bathe
sir
said
stalky
and
whence
this
sudden
zeal
for
cleanliness
there
is
nothing
about
you
that
particularly
suggests
it
indeed
so
far
as
i
remember
i
may
be
at
fault
but
a
short
time
ago
five
years
sir
said
beetle
hotly
king
scowled
of
you
was
that
thing
called
a
yes
a
so
now
you
wish
to
wash
it
is
well
cleanliness
never
injured
a
boy
or
a
house
we
will
proceed
to
business
and
he
addressed
himself
to
the
board
what
the
deuce
did
you
say
anything
to
him
for
beetle
said
mcturk
angrily
as
they
strolled
towards
the
big
open
was
fair
remindin
one
of
bein
a
my
first
term
too
heaps
of
chaps
are
when
they
ca
yes
you
ass
but
he
saw
he
fetched
you
you
ought
never
to
answer
but
it
was
fair
my
hat
you
been
here
six
years
and
you
expect
fairness
well
you
are
a
dithering
a
knot
of
king
boys
also
bound
for
the
baths
hailed
them
beseeching
them
to
wash
for
the
honor
of
their
house
that
what
comes
of
king
jawin
and
messin
those
young
animals
would
have
thought
of
it
unless
he
put
it
into
their
heads
now
they
be
funny
about
it
for
weeks
said
stalky
do
take
any
the
boys
came
nearer
shouting
an
opprobrious
word
at
last
they
moved
to
windward
ostentatiously
holding
their
noses
that
pretty
said
beetle
they
be
sayin
our
house
stinks
when
they
returned
from
the
baths
languid
at
peace
with
the
world
beetle
forecast
came
only
too
true
they
were
met
in
the
corridor
by
a
fag
a
common
fag
who
at
arm
length
handed
them
a
carefully
wrapped
piece
of
soap
with
the
compliments
of
king
hold
on
said
stalky
checking
immediate
attack
who
put
you
up
to
this
nixon
rattray
and
white
those
were
two
leaders
in
house
thank
you
there
no
oh
it
too
sickening
to
have
this
kind
o
rot
shoved
on
to
a
chap
what
the
sense
of
it
what
the
fun
of
it
said
mcturk
it
will
go
on
to
the
end
of
the
term
though
beetle
wagged
his
head
sorrowfully
he
had
worn
many
jests
threadbare
on
his
own
account
in
a
few
days
it
became
an
established
legend
of
the
school
that
house
did
not
wash
and
were
therefore
noisome
king
was
pleased
to
smile
succulently
in
form
when
one
of
his
boys
drew
aside
from
beetle
with
certain
gestures
there
seems
to
be
some
disability
attaching
to
you
my
beetle
or
else
why
should
burton
major
withdraw
so
to
speak
the
hem
of
his
garments
i
confess
i
am
still
in
the
dark
will
some
one
be
good
enough
to
enlighten
me
naturally
he
was
enlightened
by
half
the
form
extraordinary
most
extraordinary
however
each
house
has
its
traditions
with
which
i
would
not
for
the
world
interfere
have
a
prejudice
in
favor
of
washing
go
on
beetle
from
and
if
you
can
avoid
the
more
flagrant
forms
of
prout
house
was
furious
because
macrea
and
hartopp
houses
joined
king
to
insult
them
they
called
a
after
dinner
an
excited
and
angry
meeting
of
all
save
the
prefects
whose
dignity
though
they
sympathized
did
not
allow
them
to
attend
they
read
ungrammatical
resolutions
and
made
speeches
beginning
gentlemen
we
have
met
on
this
occasion
and
ending
with
it
a
beastly
shame
precisely
as
houses
have
done
since
time
and
schools
began
number
five
study
attended
with
its
usual
air
of
bland
patronage
at
last
mcturk
of
the
lanthorn
jaws
delivered
himself
you
jabber
and
jaw
and
burble
and
that
about
all
you
can
do
the
good
of
it
king
house
only
gloat
because
they
drawn
you
and
king
will
gloat
too
besides
that
resolution
of
orrin
is
of
bad
grammar
and
king
gloat
over
i
thought
you
an
beetle
would
put
it
right
an
an

but
stalky
puffed
out
his
cheeks
and
squinted
down
his
nose
in
the
style
of
panurge
and
all
he
said
was
oh
you
abject
burblers
you
three
beastly
scabs
was
the
instant
retort
of
the
democracy
and
they
went

out
of
a
establishment

communicated
with
the
great
range
of
dormitories
that

practically
from

of

each

arrangements

a
replica
of

out
from

young
rabbit
they
threw
themselves
down
under
the
rank
elder

and
began
to

aloud

account

about
a
cottage

some
ferocious
tobacco

forecourt
into
the
interior

asked
many
questions

curriculum
that

with
architecture
and
none
of
them

yet
reflected
whether

and
ceilings
were
hollow
or
solid
outside
his
own
immediate
interests
the
boy

corpse
of
a

his
voice
in

for

they
went
to
their
study
in
more
or
less
of
silence
there
they
began
to
laugh
laugh
as
only
boys
can
they
laughed
with
their
foreheads
on
the
tables
or
on
the
floor
laughed
at
length
curled
over
the
backs
of
chairs
or
clinging
to
a
laughed
themselves
limp
and
in
the
middle
of
it
orrin
entered
on
behalf
of
the
house
mind

orrin
sit
down
you
do
know
how
we
respect
and
admire
you
there
something
about
your
pure
high
young
forehead
full
of
the
dreams
of
innocent
boyhood
that
no
end
fetchin
it
is
the
house
sent
me
to
give
you
he
laid
a
folded
sheet
of
paper
on
the
table
and
retired
with
an
awful
front
it
the
resolution
oh
read
it
some
one
i
too
with
laughin
to
see
said
beetle
stalky
jerked
it
open
with
a
precautionary
sniff
phew
phew
listen
house
notices
with
pain
and
contempt
the
attitude
of
how
many
f
in
indifference
beetle
two
for
only
one
here
adopted
by
the
occupants
of
number
five
study
in
relation
to
the
insults
offered
to
prout
house
at
the
recent
meeting
in
number
twelve
and
the
house
hereby
pass
a
vote
of
censure
on
the
said
study
that
and
she
bled
all
down
my
shirt
too
said
beetle
an
i
catty
all
over
said
mcturk
though
i
washed
an
i
nearly
broke
beetle
brolly
plantin
her
where
she
would
blossom
the
situation
was
beyond
speech
but
not
laughter
there
was
some
attempt
that
night
to
demonstrate
against
the
three
in
their
dormitory
so
they
came
forth
you
see
beetle
began
suavely
as
he
loosened
his
braces
the
trouble
with
you
is
that
you
a
set
of
unthinkin
asses
you
no
more
brains
than
spidgers
we
told
you
that
heaps
of
times
have
we
we
give
the
three
of
you
a
dormitory
lickin
you
always
jaw
at
us
as
if
you
were
prefects
cried
one
oh
no
you
wo
said
stalky
because
you
know
that
if
you
did
you
get
the
worst
of
it
sooner
or
later
are
in
any
hurry
we
can
afford
to
wait
for
our
little
revenges
you
made
howlin
asses
of
yourselves
and
just
as
soon
as
king
gets
hold
of
your
precious
resolutions
you
find
that
out
if
you
are
sick
an
sorry
by
night
i
i
eat
my
but
or
ever
the
rang
the
next
day
prout
were
sadly
aware
of
their
error
king
received
stray
members
of
that
house
with
an
exaggerated
attitude
of
fear
did
they
purpose
to
cause
him
to
be
dismissed
from
the
college
by
unanimous
resolution
what
were
their
views
concerning
the
government
of
the
school
that
he
might
hasten
to
give
effect
to
them
he
would
not
offend
them
for
worlds
but
he
feared
he
sadly
feared
that
his
own
house
who
did
not
pass
resolutions
but
washed
might
somewhat
deride
king
was
a
happy
man
and
his
house
basking
in
the
favor
of
his
smile
made
that
afternoon
a
long
penance
to
the
misled
prouts
and
prout
himself
with
a
dull
and
lowering
visage
tried
to
think
out
the
rights
and
wrongs
of
it
all
only
plunging
deeper
into
bewilderment
why
should
his
house
be
called
stinkers
truly
it
was
a
small
thing
but
he
had
been
trained
to
believe
that
straws
show
which
way
the
wind
blows
and
that
there
is
no
smoke
without
fire
he
approached
king
in
with
a
sense
of
injustice
but
king
was
pleased
to
be
full
of
airy
persiflage
that
tide
and
brilliantly
danced
dialectical
rings
round
prout
now
said
stalky
at
bedtime
making
pilgrimage
through
the
dormitories
before
the
prefects
came
by
what
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourselves
foster
carton
finch
longbridge
marlin
brett
i
heard
you
chaps
catchin
it
from
king
he
made
hay
of
you
an
all
you
could
do
was
to
wriggle
an
grin
an
say
sir
an
sir
an
sir
an
sir
you
an
your
resolution
urh
oh
shut
up
not
a
bit
of
it
you
a
gaudy
lot
of
resolutionists
you
are
made
a
sweet
mess
of
it
perhaps
you
have
the
decency
to
leave
us
alone
next
here
the
house
grew
angry
and
in
many
voices
pointed
out
how
this
blunder
would
never
have
come
to
pass
if
number
five
study
had
helped
them
from
the
first
but
you
chaps
are
so
beastly
conceited
an
an
you
swaggered
into
the
meetin
as
if
we
were
a
lot
of
idiots
growled
orrin
of
the
resolution
that
precisely
what
you
are
that
what
we
been
tryin
to
hammer
into
your
thick
heads
all
this
time
said
stalky
never
mind
forgive
you
cheer
up
you
ca
help
bein
asses
you
know
and
the
enemy
flank
deftly
turned
stalky
hopped
into
bed
that
night
was
the
first
of
sorrow
among
the
jubilant
king
by
some
accident
of
drafts
the
cat
did
not
vex
the
dormitory
beneath
which
she
lay
but
the
next
one
to
the
right
stealing
on
the
air
rather
as
a
sensation
than
as
any
poignant
offense
but
the
mere
adumbration
of
an
odor
is
enough
for
the
sensitive
nose
and
clean
tongue
of
youth
decency
demands
that
we
draw
several
carbolized
sheets
over
what
the
dormitory
said
to
king
and
what
king
replied
he
was
genuinely
proud
of
his
house
and
fastidious
in
all
that
concerned
their
he
came
he
sniffed
he
said
things
next
morning
a
boy
in
that
dormitory
confided
to
his
bosom
friend
a
fag
of
macrea
that
there
was
trouble
in
their
midst
which
king
would
fain
keep
secret
but
macrea
boy
had
also
a
bosom
friend
in
prout
a
fag
of
malignant
disposition
who
when
he
had
wormed
out
the
secret
told
told
it
in
a
treble
that
rang
along
the
corridor
like
a
bat
squeak
an
an
they
been
calling
us
all
this
week
why
harland
minor
says
they
simply
ca
sleep
in
his
dormitory
for
the
stink
come
on
with
one
shout
and
with
one
cry
prout
juniors
hurled
themselves
into
the
war
and
through
the
interval
between
first
and
second
lesson
some
fifty
were
embroiled
on
the
gravel
outside
windows
to
a
tune
whose
was
the
word
hark
to
the
at
sea
said
stalky
they
were
in
their
study
collecting
books
for

a
bit
cloudy
at
prayers

said
beetle
come

they
were
outside
the
door
now
it
was
within
five
minutes
of
the
bell
and
king
might
arrive
at
any
moment
turkey
elbowed
into
a
cohort
of
scuffling
fags
cut
out
thornton
tertius
he
that
had
been
harland
bosom
friend
and
bade
him
tell
his
tale
it
was
a
simple
one
interrupted
by
tears
many
of
king

had
already
battered
him
for
libel
oh

the

into

snf

both
take
it
indeed
master
beetle
king
generally
came
to
the
for
a
minute
or
two
as
the
bell
rang
we
are
vastly
indebted
to
you
for
your
diagnosis
which
seems
to
reflect
almost
as
much
credit
on
the
natural
unwholesomeness
of
your
mind
as
it
does
upon
your
pitiful
ignorance
of
the
diseases
of
which
you
discourse
so
glibly
we
will
however
test
your
knowledge
in
other
that
was
a
merry
lesson
but
in
his
haste
to
scarify
beetle
king
clean
neglected
to
give
him
an
imposition
and
since
at
the
same
time
he
supplied
him
with
many
priceless
adjectives
for
later
use
beetle
was
well
content
and
applied
himself
most
seriously
throughout
third
lesson
algebra
with
little
hartopp
to
composing
a
poem
entitled
the
after
dinner
king
took
his
house
to
bathe
in
the
sea
off
the
pebbleridge
it
was
an
old
promise
but
he
wished
he
could
have
evaded
it
for
all
prout
lined
up
by
the
fives
court
and
cheered
with
intention
in
his
absence
not
less
than
half
the
school
invaded
the
infected
dormitory
to
draw
their
own
conclusions
the
cat
had
gained
in
the
last
twelve
hours
but
a
battlefield
of
the
fifth
day
could
not
have
been
so
flamboyant
as
the
spies
reported
my
word
she
doin
herself
proud
said
stalky
did
you
ever
smell
anything
like
it
ah
an
she
is
under
white
dormitory
at
all
but
she
will
be
give
her
time
said
beetle
she
twine
like
a
giddy
honeysuckle
what
howlin
lazarites
they
are
no
house
is
justified
in
makin
itself
a
stench
in
the
nostrils
of
decent
boys
do
you
burn
with
remorse
and
regret
said
mcturk
as
they
hastened
to
meet
the
house
coming
up
from
the
sea
king
had
deserted
it
so
speech
was
unfettered
round
its
front
played
a
crowd
of
skirmishers
all
houses
mixed
flying
reforming
shrieking
insults
on
its
tortured
flanks
marched
the
hoplites
seniors
hurling
jests
one
after
another
simple
and
primitive
jests
of
the
stone
age
to
these
the
three
added
themselves
dispassionately
with
an
air
of
aloofness
almost
sadly
and
they
look
all
right
too
said
stalky
it
ca
be
rattray
can
it
rattray
no
answer
rattray
dear
he
seems
stuffy
about
something
or
other
look
here
old
man
we
do
bear
any
malice
about
your
sending
that
soap
to
us
last
week
do
we
be
cheerful
rat
you
can
live
this
down
all
right
i
dare
say
it
only
a
few
fags
your
house
is
so
beastly
slack
you
are
going
back
to
the
house
are
you
said
mcturk
the
victims
desired
nothing
better
you
simply
no
conception
of
the
reek
up
there
of
course
frowzin
as
you
do
you
would
notice
it
but
after
this
nice
wash
and
the
clean
fresh
air
even
you
be
upset
better
camp
on
the
burrows
we
get
you
some
straw
shall
we
the
house
hurried
in
to
the
tune
of
john
brown
body
sung
by
loving
schoolmates
and
barricaded
themselves
in
their
straightway
stalky
chalked
a
large
cross
with
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
on
the
door
and
left
king
to
find
it
the
wind
shifted
that
night
and
wafted
a
into
dormitories
so
that
boys
in
nightgowns
pounded
on
the
locked
door
between
the
houses
entreating
king
to
wash
number
five
study
went
to
second
lesson
with
not
more
than
half
a
pound
of
camphor
apiece
in
their
clothing
and
king
too
wary
to
ask
for
explanations
gibbered
a
while
and
hurled
them
forth
so
beetle
finished
yet
another
poem
at
peace
in
the
study
they
usin
carbolic
now
malpas
told
me
said
stalky
king
thinks
it
the
she
need
a
lot
o
carbolic
said
mcturk
no
harm
tryin
i
suppose
it
keeps
king
out
of
i
swear
i
thought
he
was
goin
to
kill
me
when
i
sniffed
just
now
he
did
mind
burton
major
sniffin
at
me
the
other
day
though
he
never
stopped
alexander
howlin
into
our
before
before
we
doctored
he
just
grinned
said
stalky
what
was
he
frothing
over
you
for
beetle
aha
that
was
my
subtle
jape
i
had
him
on
toast
you
know
he
always
jaws
about
the
learned
at
the
age
of
four
that
chap
said
mcturk
yes
whenever
he
hears
i
written
a
poem
well
just
as
i
was
down
i
whispered
is
our
learned
lepsius
to
burton
major
old
butt
grinned
like
an
owl
did
know
what
i
was
drivin
at
but
king
jolly
well
did
that
was
really
why
he
hove
us
out
ai
you
grateful
now
shut
up
i
goin
to
write
the
of
the
learned
lipsius
keep
clear
of
anything
coarse
then
said
stalky
i
should
like
to
be
coarse
on
this
happy
not
for
what
rhymes
to
someone
in
at
lunch
king
discoursed
acridly
to
prout
of
boys
with
prurient
minds
who
perverted
their
few
and
baleful
talents
to
sap
discipline
and
corrupt
their
equals
to
deal
in
foul
imagery
and
destroy
reverence
but
you
did
seem
to
consider
this
when
your
house
called
us
ah
stinkers
if
you
had
assured
me
that
you
never
interfere
with
another
man
house
i
should
almost
believe
that
it
was
a
few
casual
remarks
of
yours
that
started
all
this
prout
had
endured
much
for
king
always
took
his
temper
to
meals
you
spoke
to
beetle
yourself
did
you
something
about
not
bathing
and
being
a
the
school
chaplain
put
in
i
was
scoring
in
the
pavilion
that
i
may
have
jestingly
i
really
do
pretend
to
remember
every
remark
i
let
fall
among
small
boys
and
full
well
i
know
the
beetle
has
no
feelings
to
be
may
be
but
he
or
they
it
comes
to
to
same
thing
have
the
own
knack
of
discovering
a
man
weak
place
i
confess
i
rather
go
out
of
my
way
to
conciliate
number
five
study
it
may
be
soft
but
so
far
i
believe
i
am
the
only
man
here
whom
they
have
maddened
by
their
well
that
is
all
beside
the
point
i
flatter
myself
i
can
deal
with
them
alone
as
occasion
arises
but
if
they
feel
themselves
morally
supported
by
those
who
should
wield
an
absolute
and
justice
then
i
say
that
my
lot
is
indeed
a
hard
one
of
all
things
i
detest
i
admit
that
anything
verging
on
disloyalty
among
ourselves
is
the
the
looked
at
one
another
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
and
prout
blushed
i
deny
it
absolutely
he
said
er
in
fact
i
own
that
i
personally
object
to
all
three
of
them
it
is
not
fair
therefore
to
how
long
do
you
propose
to
allow
it
said
king
but
surely
said
macrea
deserting
his
usual
ally
the
blame
if
there
be
any
rests
with
you
king
you
ca
hold
them
responsible
for
the
you
prefer
the
good
old
i
believe
stink
in
your
house
my
boys
are
complaining
of
it
what
can
you
expect
you
know
what
boys
are
naturally
they
take
advantage
of
what
to
them
is
a
opportunity
said
little
hartopp
what
the
trouble
in
your
dormitories
king
king
explained
that
as
he
had
made
it
the
one
rule
of
his
life
never
to
interfere
with
another
man
house
so
he
expected
not
to
be
too
patently
interfered
with
they
might
be
interested
to
learn
here
the
chaplain
heaved
a
weary
sigh
that
he
had
taken
all
steps
that
in
his
poor
judgment
would
meet
the
needs
of
the
case
nay
further
he
had
himself
expended
with
no
thought
of
reimbursement
sums
the
amount
of
which
he
would
not
specify
on
disinfectants
this
he
had
done
because
he
knew
by
bitter
by
most
bitter
experience
that
the
management
of
the
college
was
slack
dilatory
and
inefficient
he
might
even
add
almost
as
slack
as
the
administration
of
certain

viciously
with
his
fork
into

i
do
pretend
to
be
a
strong
man
as
you
know
but
i
confess
i
ca
see
any
reason
why
i
should
take
steps
against
stalky
and
the
others
because
king
happens
to
be
annoyed
by
by
falling
into
the
pit
he
has
digged
said
little
hartopp
certainly
not
prout
no
one
accuses
you
of
setting
one

another

some
unlucky
child
of
thirteen

will
repeat
to
us
every
word
of
his
brilliant
repartees
and
all
will
be
but
about
those
three
are
they
so
nonsense
said
little
hartopp
if
you
thought
for
a
minute
prout
you
would
see
that
the
flow
of
fetid
imagery
that
king
complains
of
is
borrowed
wholesale
from
king

that
impelled
the
steel

he
does
not
approve

into

the

never

could
not

could
hear
almost
every
word
on
the
gravel
outside
a
light
and
wary
footstep
came
up
from
number
five
rattray
in
a
subdued
voice
rattray

anywhere
about

discreetly
left
the

in

was
no

like
the

for

stank
vehemently
and
none

what
to

of
it
save
king
and
he
washed
the

them
with

prout
pet
phrase
i
have
a
few
words
to
impart
to
you
my
young
friend
we
will
discourse
together
a
here
the
listening
prout
sputtered
beetle
in
a
strained
voice
had
chosen
a
favorite
gambit
of
king
i
repeat
master
rattray
we
will
confer
and
the
matter
of
our
discourse
shall
not
be

for
that
is
a
loathsome
and
obscene
word
we
will
with
your
good
leave
granted
i
trust
master
rattray
granted
i
trust
study
this
this
scabrous
upheaval
of
latent
demoralization
what
impresses
me
most
is
not
so
much
the
blatant
indecency
with
which
you
swagger
abroad
under
your
load
of
putrescence
you
must
imagine
this
discourse
punctuated
with
but
old
rattray
was
ever
a
bad
shot
as
the
cynical
immorality
with
which
you
revel
in
your
abhorrent
aromas
far
be
it
from
me
to
interfere
with
another
house
good
lord
said
prout
but
this
is
line

letter

listen
said
little
hartopp
but
to
say
that
you
stink
as
certain
lewd
fellows
of
the
baser
sort
aver
is
to
say
nothing
less
than
nothing
in
the
absence
of
your
beloved
for
whom
no
one
has
a
higher
regard
than
myself
i
will
if

no

changed
from
a
pecking
fluttering

to
tragic
earnestness
this
was
the
the
open
cesspit
that
dared
to
call

now
and
now

shelter

behind

unspeakably
thank

i

this
is

i
should
scarcely

to
contain
myself
before
your
mocking
in
an
undertone
beetle
had
spied
king
sailing
down
the
corridor
and
what
may
you
be
doing
here
my
little
friends
the
began
i
had
a
fleeting
notion
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
the
listeners
with
one
accord
choked
that
if
i
found
you
outside
my
house
i
should
visit
you
with
dire
pains
and
we
were
just
goin
for
a
walk
sir
said
beetle
and
you
stopped
to
speak
to
rattray
yes
sir
we
been
throwing
said
rattray
coming
out
of
the
study
old
rat
is
more
of
a
diplomat
than
i
thought
so
far
he
is
strictly
within
the
truth
said
little
hartopp
observe
the
ethics
of
it
oh
you
were
sporting
with
them
were
you
i
must
say
i
do
not
envy
you
your
choice
of
associates
i
fancied
they
might
have
been
engaged
in
some
of
the
prurient
discourse
with
which
they
have
been
so
disgustingly
free
of
late
i
should
strongly
advise
you
to
direct
your
steps
most
carefully
in
the
future
pick
up
those
he
passed
on
next
day
richards
who
had
been
a
carpenter
in
the
navy
and
to
whom
odd
jobs
were
confided
was
ordered
to
take
up
a
dormitory
floor
for
king
held
that
something
must
have
died
there
we
need
not
neglect
all
our
work
for
a
trumpery
incident
of
this
nature
though
i
am
quite
aware
that
little
things
please
little
minds
yes
i
have
decreed
the
boards
to
be
taken
up
after
lunch
under
richards
auspices
i
have
no
doubt
it
will
be
vastly
interesting
to
a
certain
type
of
intellect
but
any
boy
of
my
house
or
another
found
on
the
dormitory
stairs
will
render
himself
liable
to
three
hundred
the
boys
did
not
collect
on
the
stairs
but
most
of
them
waited
outside
king
richards
had
been
bound
to
cry
the
news
from
the
attic
window
and
if
possible
to
exhibit
the
corpse
is
a
cat
a
dead
cat
richards
face
showed
purple
at
the
window
he
had
been
in
the
chamber
of
death
and
on
his
knees
for
some
time

some
of
the
cries

followed

what
a
king
boy
cried
furiously
kill
a
poor
innocent
cat
every
time
you
want
to
get

awfully
hard
to

i

richards
spat
on
a
fresh

and
fell
to
his
work
chuckling
the
impressionists
they
had
dropped
into
the
chaplain
study
for
a
saturday
night
smoke
four
and
the
three
briars
and
the
one
cigar
reeking
in
amity
proved
the
rev
john
gillett
good
generalship
since
the
discovery
of
the
cat
king
had
been
too
ready
to
see
affront
where
none
was
meant
and
the
reverend
john
and
general
confidant
had
worked
for
a
week
to
bring
about
a
good
understanding
he
was
fat
except
for
a
big
mustache
of
an
imperturbable
good
temper
and
those
who
loved
him
least
said
a
guileful
jesuit
he
smiled
benignantly
upon
his
handiwork
four
sorely
tried
men
talking
without
very
much
malice
now
remember
he
said
when
the
conversation
turned
that
way
i
impute
nothing
but
every
time
that
any
one
has
taken
direct
steps
against
number
five
study
the
issue
has
been
more
or
less
humiliating
to
the
i
ca
admit
that
i
pulverize
the
egregious
beetle
daily
for
his
soul
good
and
the
others
with
him
said
king
well
take
your
own
case
king
and
go
back
a
couple
of
years
do
you
remember
when
prout
and
you
were
on
their
track
for
hutting
and
trespass
was
it
have
you
forgotten
colonel
dabney
the
others
laughed
king
did
not
care
to
be
reminded
of
his
career
as
a
poacher
that
was
one
instance
again
when
you
had
rooms
below
them
i
always
said
that
that
was
entering
the
lion
den
you
turned
them
for
making
disgusting
noises
surely
gillett
you
do
excuse
all
i
say
is
that
you
turned
them
out
that
same
evening
your
study
was
by
most
beastly
drunk
from
the
road
said
king
what
has
that
the
reverend
john
went
on
lastly
they
conceive
that
aspersions
are
cast
upon
their
personal
cleanliness
a
most
delicate
matter
with
all
boys
good
observe
how
in
each
case
the
punishment
fits
the
crime
a
week
after
your
house
calls
them
king
your
house
is
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
on
it
stunk
out
by
a
dead
cat
who
chooses
to
die
in
the
one
spot
where
she
can
annoy
you
most
again
the
long
arm
of
coincidence
you
accuse
them
of
trespass
through
some
absurd
chain
of
circumstances
they
may
or
may
not
be
at
the
other
end
of
it
you
and
prout
are
made
to
appear
as
trespassers
you
evict
them
for
a
time
your
study
is
made
untenable
i
have
drawn
the
parallel
in
the
last
case
well
she
was
under
the
centre
of
white
dormitory
said
king
there
are
double
there
to
deaden
noise
no
boy
even
in
my
own
house
could
possibly
have
pried
up
the
boards
without
leaving
some
trace
and
was
phenomenally
drunk
that
other
they
are
singularly
favored
by
fortune
that
is
all
i
ever
said
personally
i
like
them
immensely
and
i
believe
i
have
a
little
of
their
confidence
i
confess
i
like
being
called
they
are
at
peace
with
me
consequently
i
am
not
treated
to
bogus
confessions
of
you
mean
mason
case
said
prout
heavily
that
always
struck
me
as
peculiarly
scandalous
i
thought
the
head
should
have
taken
up
the
matter
more
thoroughly
mason
may
be
misguided
but
at
least
he
is
thoroughly
sincere
and
means
i
confess
i
can
not
agree
with
you
prout
said
the
reverend
john
he
jumped
at
some
silly
tale
of
theft
on
their
part
accepted
another
evidence
without
so
far
as
i
can
see
any
inquiry
and
frankly
i
think
he
deserved
all
he
they
deliberately
outraged
mason
best
feelings
said
prout
a
word
to
me
on
their
part
would
have
saved
the
whole
thing
but
they
preferred
to
lure
him
on
to
play
on
his
ignorance
of
their
characters
that
may
be
said
king
but
i
do
like
mason
i
dislike
him
for
the
very
reason
that
prout
advances
to
his
credit
he
means
our
criminal
tradition
is
not
theft
among
ourselves
at
least
said
little
hartopp
for
the
head
of
a
house
that
raided
seven
head
of
cattle
from
the
innocent
of
northam
is
that
rather
a
sweeping
statement
said
macrea
precisely
so
said
hartopp
unabashed
that
with
and
a
little
poaching
and
on
the
cliffs
is
our
it
does
us
far
more
harm
as
a
school
prout
began
than
any
scandal
could
quite
so
our
reputation
among
the
farmers
is
most
unsavory
but
i
would
much
sooner
deal
with
any
amount
of
ingenious
crime
of
that
nature
than
some
other
they
may
be
all
right
but
they
are
unboylike
abnormal
and
in
my
opinion
unsound
prout
insisted
the
moral
effect
of
their
performances
must
pave
the
way
for
greater
harm
it
makes
me
doubtful
how
to
deal
with
them
i
might
separate
you
might
of
course
but
they
have
gone
up
the
school
together
for
six
years
should
care
to
do
it
said
macrea
they
use
the
editorial
said
king
irrelevantly
it
annoys
me
your
prose
corkran
sir
we
have
quite
done
it
yet
bring
it
in
a
minute
and
so
on
and
the
same
with
the
there
great
virtue
in
that
said
little
hartopp
you
know
i
take
them
for
trig
mcturk
may
have
some
conception
of
the
meaning
of
it
but
beetle
is
as
the
brutes
that
perish
about
sines
and
cosines
he
copies
serenely
from
stalky
who
positively
rejoices
in
why
do
you
stop
it
said
prout
it
rights
itself
at
the
exams
then
beetle
shows
up
blank
sheets
and
trusts
to
his
to
save
him
from
a
fall
i
fancy
he
spends
most
of
his
time
with
me
in
writing
i
wish
to
heaven
he
would
transfer
a
little
of
his
energy
in
that
direction
to
king
jerked
himself
upright
he
is
with
the
single
exception
of
stalky
the
very
vilest
manufacturer
of
hexameters
that
i
have
ever
dealt
the
work
is
combined
in
that
study
said
the
chaplain
stalky
does
the
mathematics
mcturk
the
latin
and
beetle
attends
to
their
english
and
french
at
least
when
he
was
in
the
last
month
malingering
prout
interjected
quite
possibly
i
found
a
very
distinct
falling
off
in
their
jeune
homme
pauvre
i
think
it
is
profoundly
immoral
said
prout
i
always
been
opposed
to
the
study
it
would
be
hard
to
find
any
study
where
the
boys
do
help
each
other
but
in
number
five
the
thing
has
probably
been
reduced
to
a
system
said
little
hartopp
they
have
a
system
in
most
they
confess
as
much
said
the
reverend
john
i
seen
mcturk
being
hounded
up
the
stairs
to
elegise
the
in
a
churchyard
while
beetle
and
stalky
went
to
it
amounts
to
systematic
cribbing
said
prout
his
voice
growing
deeper
and
deeper
no
such
thing
little
hartopp
returned
you
ca
teach
a
cow
the
in
intention
it
is
but
we
spoke
under
the
seal
of
the
confessional
did
we
said
the
reverend
john
you
say
you
heard
them
arranging
their
work
in
this
way
gillett
prout
persisted
good
heavens
do
make
me
queen
evidence
my
dear
fellow
hartopp
is
equally
incriminated
if
they
ever
found
out
that
i
had
sneaked
our
relations
would
suffer
and
i
value
i
think
your
attitude
in
this
matter
is
weak
said
prout
looking
round
for
support
it
would
be
really
better
to
break
up
the
study
for
a
while
would
it
oh
break
it
up
by
all
means
said
macrea
we
shall
see
then
if
gillett
theory
holds
be
wise
prout
leave
them
alone
or
calamity
will
overtake
you
and
what
is
much
more
important
they
will
be
annoyed
with
me
i
am
too
fat
alas
to
be
worried
by
bad
boys
where
are
you
going
nonsense
they
would
not
dare
i
am
going
to
think
this
out
said
prout
it
needs
thought
in
intention
they
cribbed
and
i
must
think
out
my
he
perfectly
capable
of
putting
the
boys
on
their
honor
it
that
am
a
the
reverend
john
looked
round
remorsefully
never
again
will
i
forget
that
a
master
is
not
a
man
mark
my
words
said
the
reverend
john
there
will
be
but
by
the
yellow
tiber
was
tumult
and
affright
out
of
the
blue
sky
they
were
still
rejoicing
over
the
cat
war
prout
had
dropped
into
number
five
read
them
a
lecture
on
the
enormity
of
cribbing
and
bidden
them
return
to
the
on
monday
they
had
raged
solo
and
chorus
all
through
the
peaceful
sabbath
for
their
sin
was
more
or
less
the
daily
practice
of
all
the
studies
what
the
good
of
cursing
said
stalky
at
last
we
all
in
the
same
boat
we
got
to
go
back
and
consort
with
the
house
a
locker
in
the
and
a
seat
at
prep
in
number
he
looked
regretfully
round
the
cozy
study
which
mcturk
their
leader
in
matters
of
art
had
decorated
with
a
dado
a
stencil
and
cretonne
hangings
yes
heffy
lurchin
into
the
like
a
frowzy
old
retriever
to
see
if
we
are
up
to
something
you
know
he
never
leaves
his
house
alone
these
days
said
mcturk
oh

will
be
giddy
why

watchin
cricket

like
a
robust
healthy
boy

no
end
of
interest
in
the
house

had

in
the
for
a
year
we

house
received
them
on
their
fall
with
the
mixture
of
jest
and
sympathy
always
extended
to
boys
turned
out
of
their
study
the
known
aloofness
of
the
three
made
them
more
interesting
quite
like
old
times
ai
it
stalky
selected
a
locker
and
flung
in
his
books
we
come
to
sport
with
you
my
young
friends
for
a
while
because
our
beloved
has
hove
us

stalky
we
ca
maintain
our
giddy
prestige
orrin
if
you
make
these
they
wrapped
themselves
lovingly
about
the
boy
thrust
him
to
the
opened
window
and
drew
down
the
sash
to
the
nape
of
his
neck
with
an
equal
swiftness
they
tied
his
thumbs
together
behind
his
back
with
a
piece
of
twine
and
then
because
he
kicked
furiously
removed
his
shoes
there
prout
happened
to
find
him
a
few
minutes
later
guillotined
and
helpless
surrounded
by
a
convulsed
crowd
who
would
not
assist
stalky
in
an
upper
had
gathered
himself
allies
against
vengeance
orrin
presently
tore
up
at
the
head
of
a
boarding
party
and
the
grew
one
fog
of
dust
through
which
boys
wrestled
stamped
shouted
and
yelled
a
desk
was
carried
away
in
the
tumult
a
knot
of
warriors
reeled
into
and
split
a
a
window
was
broken
and
a
fell
under
cover
of
the
confusion
the
three
escaped
to
the
corridor
whence
they
called
in

and
added
themselves
to
the
embroilment
not
bad
for
the
first
evening
work
said
stalky
rearranging
his
collar
i
fancy
prout
be
somewhat
annoyed

better
establish
an
so
they
sat
on
king
railings
till
prep
you
see
quoth
stalky
as
they
strolled
up
to
prep
with
the
ignoble
herd
if
you
get
the
houses
well
mixed
up
an
scufflin
it
even
bettin

jest
with
number
where

shillin

said
beetle
suddenly
stalky
could
not
see
prout
behind
him
but
returned
the
lead
without
a
quaver
i
only
owed
you
ninepence
you
old
you
forgotten
the
interest
said
mcturk
a
halfpenny
a
week
per
bob

be
beastly
rich
well
beetle
lent
me
stalky
came
to
a
full
stop
and
made
as
to
work
it
out
on
his
fingers
sixpence
on
the
nineteenth
did
he
yes
but
you
forgotten
you
paid
no
interest
on
the
other
bob
the
one
i
lent
you
but
you
took
my
watch
as
the
game
was
developing
itself
almost
automatically
never
mind
pay
me
my
interest
or
i
charge
you
interest
on
interest
remember
i
got
your
shouted
beetle
you
are
a
jew
stalky
groaned
hush
said
mcturk
very
loudly
indeed
and
started
as
prout
came
upon
them
i
did
see
you
in
that
disgraceful
affair
in
the
just
now
said
he
what
sir
we
just
come
up
from
king
said
stalky
please
sir
what
am
i
to
do
about
they
broken
the
desk
you
told
me
to
sit
at
and
the
form
just
swimming
with
find
another
seat
find
another
seat
expect
me
to
you
i
wish
to
know
whether
you
are
in
the
habit
of
advancing
money
to
your
associates
beetle
no
sir
not
as
a
general
rule
it
is
a
most
reprehensible
habit
i
thought
that
my
house
at
least
would
be
free
from
it
even
with
my
opinion
of
you
i
hardly
thought
it
was
one
of
your
there
no
harm
in
lending
money
sir
is
there
i
am
not
going
to
bandy
words
with
you
on
your
notions
of
morality
how
much
have
you
lent
corkran
i
i
do
quite
know
said
beetle
it
is
difficult
to
improvise
a
going
concern
on
the
spur
of
the
minute
you
seemed
certain
enough
just
i
think
it
two
and
fourpence
said
mcturk
with
a
glance
of
cold
scorn
at
beetle
in
the
hopelessly
involved
finances
of
the
study
there
was
just
that
sum
to
which
both
mcturk
and
beetle
laid
claim
as
their
share
in
the
pledging
of
stalky
sunday
trousers
but
stalky
had
maintained
for
two
terms
that
the
money
was
his
commission
for
effecting
the
pawn
and
had
of
course
spent
it
on
a
study
understand
this
then
you
are
not
to
continue
your
operations
as
a
two
and
fourpence
you
said
corkran
stalky
had
said
nothing
and
continued
so
to
do
your
influence
for
evil
is
quite
strong
enough
without
buying
a
hold
over
your
he
felt
in
his
pockets
and
oh
joy
produced
a
florin
and
fourpence
bring
me
what
you
call
corkran
and
be
thankful
that
i
do
not
carry
the
matter
any
further
the
money
is
stopped
from
your
corkran
the
receipt
to
my
study
at
once
little
they
cared
two
and
fourpence
in
a
lump
is
worth
six
weekly
sixpences
any
hungry
day
of
the
week
but
what
the
dooce
is
a
said
beetle
i
only
read
about
it
in
a
now
you
jolly
well
got
to
make
one
said
stalky
yes
but
our
ink
do
turn
black
till
next
day
he
spot
that
not
him
he
too
worried
said
mcturk
sign
your
name
on
a
bit
of
stalky
and
write
o
u
two
and
fourpence
you
grateful
to
me
for
getting
that
out
of
prout
stalky
never
have
paid
why
you
ass
mechanically
beetle
had
handed
over
the
money
to
stalky
as
treasurer
of
the
study
the
custom
of
years
is
not
lightly
broken
in
return
for
the
document
prout
expounded
to
beetle
the
enormity
of
which
like
everything
except
compulsory
cricket
corrupted
houses
and
destroyed
good
feeling
among
boys
made
youth
cold
and
calculating
and
opened
the
door
to
all
evil
finally
did
beetle
know
of
any
other
cases
if
so
it
was
his
duty
as
proof
of
repentance
to
let
his
know
no
names
need
be
mentioned
beetle
did
not
know
at
least
he
was
not
quite
sure
sir
how
could
he
give
evidence
against
his
friends
the
house
might
of
course
here
he
feigned
an
anguished
delicacy
be
full
of
it
he
was
not
in
a
position
to
say
he
had
not
met
with
any
open
competition
in
his
trade
but
if
prout
considered
it
was
a
matter
that
affected
the
honor
of
the
house
prout
did
consider
it
precisely
that
perhaps
the
would
be
better
he
spun
it
out
till
through
prep
and
said
the
amateur
shylock
returning
to
the
and
dropping
at
stalky
side
if
he
do
think
the
house
is
putrid
with
it
several
that
all
i
been
to
prout
study
this
to
the
he
said
i
could
sit
where
i
liked
sir
oh
he
is
just
tricklin
with
emotion
yes
sir
i
only
askin
corkran
to
let
me
have
a
dip
in
his
after
prayers
on
the
road
to
the
dormitories
harrison
and
craye
senior
zealous
in
their
office
waylaid
them
with
great
anger
what
have
you
been
doing
to
heffy
this
time
beetle
he
been
jawing
us
all
the
what
has
his
serene
transparency
been
vexin
you
for
said
mcturk
about
beetle
lendin
money
to
stalky
began
harrison
and
then
beetle
went
and
told
him
that
there
was
any
amount
of
in
the
no
you
do
said
beetle
sitting
on
a
that
just
what
i
did
tell
him
i
spoke
the
giddy
truth
he
asked
me
if
there
was
much
of
it
in
the
house
and
i
said
i
did
he
thinks
you
a
set
of
filthy
shylocks
said
mcturk
it
just
as
well
for
you
he
do
think
you
burglars
you
know
he
never
gets
a
notion
out
of
his
conscientious
old
man
did
it
all
for
the
stalky
curled
gracefully
round
the
head
in
a
full
confession
in
the
left
boot
bad
for
the
honor
of
the
house
shut
up
said
harrison
you
chaps
always
behave
as
if
you
were
us
when
we
come
to
jaw
you
a
lot
too
cheeky
said
craye
i
do
quite
see
where
the
cheek
comes
in
except
on
your
part
in
interferin
with
a
private
matter
between
me
an
beetle
after
it
has
been
settled
by
stalky
winked
cheerfully
at
the
others
that
the
worst
of
clever
little
swots
said
mcturk
addressing
the
gas
they
get
made
prefects
before
they
have
any
tact
and
then
they
annoy
chaps
who
could
really
help
to
look
after
the
honor
of
the
we
wo
trouble
you
to
do
that
said
craye
hotly
then
what
are
you
badgerin
us
for
said
beetle
on
your
own
showing
you
been
so
beastly
slack
looking
after
the
house
that
prout
believes
it
a
nest
of
i
told
him
that
i
lent
money
to
stalky
and
no
one
else
i
do
know
whether
he
believes
me
but
that
finishes
my
case
the
rest
is
your
now
we
find
out
stalky
voice
rose
that
there
is
apparently
an
organized
conspiracy
throughout
the
house
for
aught
we
know
the
fags
may
be
lendin
and
borrowin
far
beyond
their
means
we
responsible
for
it
we
only
the
rank
and
are
you
surprised
we
do
wish
to
associate
with
the
house
said
mcturk
with
dignity
we
kept
ourselves
to
ourselves
in
our
study
till
we
were
turned
out
and
now
we
find
ourselves
let
in
for
for
this
sort
of
thing
it
simply
then
you
hector
and
bullyrag
us
on
the
stairs
said
stalky
about
matters
that
are
your
business
entirely
you
know
we
are
you
threatened
us
with
a
prefect
lickin
just
now
said
beetle
boldly
inventing
as
he
saw
the
bewilderment
in
the
faces
of
the
enemy
and
if
you
expect
you
gain
anything
from
us
by
your
way
of
approachin
us
you
jolly
well
mistaken
that
all
they
clattered
upstairs
injured
virtue
on
every
inch
of
their
backs
but
but
what
the
dickens
have
we
done
said
harrison
amazedly
to
craye
i
do
know
only
it
always
happens
that
way
when
one
has
anything
to
do
with
them
they
so
beastly
and
prout
called
the
good
boys
into
his
study
anew
and
succeeded
in
sinking
both
his
and
their
innocent
minds
ten
fathoms
deeper
in
blindfolded
bedazement
he
spoke
of
steps
and
measures
of
tone
and
loyalty
in
the
house
and
to
the
house
and
urged
them
to
take
up
the
matter
tactfully
so
they
demanded
of
beetle
whether
he
had
any
connection
with
any
other
establishment
beetle
promptly
went
to
his
and
wished
to
know
by
what
right
harrison
and
craye
had
reopened
a
matter
already
settled
between
him
and
his
in
injured
innocence
no
boy
excelled
beetle
then
it
occurred
to
prout
that
he
might
have
been
unfair
to
the
culprit
who
had
not
striven
to
deny
or
palliate
his
offense
he
sent
for
harrison
and
craye
reprehending
them
very
gently
for
the
tone
they
had
adopted
to
a
repentant
sinner
and
when
they
returned
to
their
study
they
used
the
language
of
despair
they
then
made
headlong
inquisition
through
the
house
driving
the
fags
to
the
edge
of
hysterics
and
unearthing
with
tremendous
pomp
and
parade
the
natural
and
inevitable
system
of
small
loans
that
prevails
among
small
boys
you
see
harrison
thornton
minor
lent
me
a
penny
last
saturday
because
i
was
fined
for
breaking
the
window
and
i
spent
it
at
keyte
i
did
know
there
was
any
harm
in
it
and
wray
major
borrowed
twopence
from
me
when
my
uncle
sent
me
a
order
i
cashed
it
at
keyte
for
five
bob
but
he
pay
me
back
before
the
holidays
we
did
know
there
was
anything
wrong
in
they
waded
through
hours
of
this
kind
of
thing
but
found
no
usury
or
anything
approaching
to
beetle
gorgeous
scale
of
interest
the
seniors
for
the
school
had
no
tradition
of
deference
to
prefects
outside
compulsory
games
told
them
succinctly
to
go
about
their
business
they
would
not
give
evidence
on
any
terms
harrison
was
one
idiot
and
craye
was
another
but
the
greatest
of
all
they
said
was
their
when
a
house
is
thoroughly
upset
however
good
its
conscience
it
breaks
into
knots
and
coteries
small
gatherings
in
the
twilight
committees
and
groups
in
the
corridor
and
when
from
group
to
group
with
an
immense
affectation
of
secrecy
three
wicked
boys
steal
crying
when
there
is
no
need
of
caution
and
whispering
do
tell
on
the
heels
of
trumpery
confidences
that
instant
invented
a
very
fine
air
of
plot
and
intrigue
can
be
woven
round
such
a
house
at
the
end
of
a
few
days
it
dawned
on
prout
that
he
moved
in
an
atmosphere
of
perpetual
ambush
mysteries
hedged
him
on
all
sides
warnings
ran
before
his
heavy
feet
and
countersigns
were
muttered
behind
his
attentive
back
mcturk
and
stalky
invented
many
absurd
and
idle
phrases
that
swept
through
the
house
as
fire
through
stubble
it
was
a
rare
jest
and
the
only
practical
outcome
of
the
usury
commission
that
one
boy
should
say
to
a
friend
with
awful
gravity
do
you
think
there
much
of
it
going
on
in
the
house
the
other
would
reply
well
one
ca
be
too
careful
you
the
effect
on
a
of
humane
conscience
and
good
intent
may
be
imagined
again
a
man
who
has
sincerely
devoted
himself
to
gaining
the
esteem
of
his
charges
does
not
like
to
hear
himself
described
even
at
a
distance
as
popularity
prout
by
a
dark
and
scowling
celt
with
a
fluent
tongue
a
rumor
that
stories
unusual
stories
are
told
in
the
between
the
lights
by
a
boy
who
does
not
command
his
confidence
agitates
such
a
man
and
even
elaborate
and
tender
politeness
for
the
courtesy
men
offer
to
a
bewildered
child
was
the
courtesy
that
stalky
wrapped
round
prout
restores
not
his
peace
of
mind
the
tone
of
the
house
seems
changed
changed
for
the
worse
said
prout
to
harrison
and
craye
have
you
noticed
it
i
do
for
an
instant
impute
he
never
imputed
anything
but
on
the
other
hand
he
never
did
anything
else
and
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
he
had
reduced
the
to
a
state
as
nearly
bordering
on
nervous
irritation
as
healthy
boys
can
know
worst
of
all
they
began
at
times
to
wonder
whether
stalky
had
not
some
truth
in
their
assertions
that
prout
was
a
gloomy
ass
as
you
know
i
am
not
the
kind
of
man
who
puts
himself
out
for
every
little
thing
he
hears
i
believe
in
letting
the
house
work
out
their
own
salvation
with
a
light
guiding
hand
on
the
reins
of
course
but
there
is
a
perceptible
lack
of
reverence
lower
tone
in
matters
that
touch
the
honor
of
the
house
a
sort
of
oh
prout
he
is
a
nobleman
a
nobleman
a
nobleman
our
heffy
is
a
nobleman
he
does
an
awful
lot
because
his
popularity
oh
his
giddy
popularity
would
suffer
did
he
not
the
study
door
stood
ajar
and
the
song
borne
by
twenty
clear
voices
came
faint
from
a
the
fags
rather
liked
the
tune
the
words
were
beetle
that
a
thing
no
sensible
man
objects
to
said
prout
with
a
smile
but
you
know
straws
show
which
way
the
wind
blows
can
you
trace
it
to
any
direct
influence
i
am
speaking
to
you
now
as
heads
of
the
there
is
the
least
doubt
of
it
said
harrison
angrily
i
know
what
you
mean
sir
it
all
began
when
number
five
study
came
to
the
there
no
use
blinkin
it
craye
you
know
that
they
make
things
rather
difficult
for
us
sometimes
said
craye
more
their
manner
than
anything
else
that
harrison
do
they
hamper
you
in
the
discharge
of
your
duties
then
well
no
sir
they
only
look
on
and
grin
and
turn
up
their
noses
ah
said
prout
sympathetically
i
think
sir
said
craye
plunging
into
the
business
boldly
it
would
be
a
great
deal
better
if
they
were
sent
back
to
their
study
better
for
the
house
they
are
rather
old
to
be
knocking
about
the
they
are
younger
than
orrin
or
flint
and
a
dozen
others
that
i
can
think
yes
sir
but
that
different
somehow
they
rather
influential
they
have
a
knack
of
upsettin
things
in
a
quiet
way
that
one
ca
take
hold
of
at
least
if
one
does
and
you
think
they
would
be
better
in
their
own
study
again
emphatically
harrison
and
craye
were
of
that
opinion
as
harrison
said
to
craye
afterwards
they
weakened
our
authority
they
too
big
to
lick
they
made
an
exhibition
of
us
over
this
usury
business
and
we
a
to
the
rest
of
the
school
i
going
up
for
sandhurst
understood
next
term
they
managed
to
knock
me
out
of
half
my
work
already
with
their
their
lunacy
if
they
go
back
to
their
study
we
may
have
a
little
hullo
mcturk
ambled
round
the
corner
with
a
roving
eye
on
all
possible
horizons
bearin
up
old
man
that
right
live
it
down
live
it
down
what
mean
you
look
a
little
pensive
said
mcturk
exhaustin
job
the
honor
of
the
house
ai
it
by
the
way
how
are
you
off
for
look
here
said
harrison
hoping
for
instant
reward
recommended
prout
to
let
you
go
back
to
your
the
dooce
you
have
and
who
under
the
sun
are
to
interfere
between
us
and
our
upon
my
sam
you
two
try
us
very
hard
you
do
indeed
of
course
we
do
know
how
far
you
abuse
your
position
to
prejudice
us
with
prout
but
when
you
deliberately
stop
me
to
tell
me
you
been
makin
arrangements
behind
our
back
in
secret
with
prout
i
i
do
know
really
what
we
ought
to
that
beastly
unfair
cried
craye
it
mcturk
had
adopted
a
ghastly
solemnity
that
sat
well
on
his
long
lean
face
hang
it
all
a
prefect
one
thing
and
an
another
but
you
seem
to
combine
you
recommend
this
you
recommend
that
say
how
and
when
we
go
back
to
our
study
but
but
we
thought
you
like
it
turkey
we
did
indeed
you
know
you
be
ever
so
much
more
comfortable
harrison
voice
was
almost
tearful
mcturk
turned
away
as
though
to
hide
his
emotions
they
broke
he
hunted
up
stalky
and
beetle
in
a
sick
they
been
beggin
heffy
to
let
us
go
back
to
number
five
poor
devils
poor
little
devils
it
the
olive
branch
was
stalky
comment
it
the
giddy
white
flag
by
gum
come
to
think
of
it
we
metagrobolized
just
after
tea
that
day
prout
sent
for
them
to
say
that
if
they
chose
to
ruin
their
future
by
neglecting
their
work
it
was
entirely
their
own
affair
he
wished
them
however
to
understand
that
their
presence
in
the
could
not
be
tolerated
one
hour
longer
he
personally
did
not
care
to
think
of
the
time
he
must
spend
in
eliminating
the
traces
of
their
evil
influences
how
far
beetle
had
pandered
to
the
baser
side
of
youthful
imagination
he
would
ascertain
later
and
beetle
might
be
sure
that
if
prout
came
across
any
consequences
consequences
of
what
sir
said
beetle
genuinely
bewildered
this
time
and
mcturk
quietly
kicked
him
on
the
ankle
for
being
fetched
by
prout
beetle
the
continued
knew
very
well
what
was
intended
evil
and
brief
had
been
their
careers
under
his
eye
and
as
one
standing
loco
to
their
yet
uncontaminated
associates
he
was
bound
to
take
his
precautions
the
return
of
the
study
key
closed
the
sermon
but
what
was
the
business
said
beetle
on
the
stairs
i
never
knew
such
an
ass
as
you
are
for
justifyin
yourself
said
mcturk
i
hope
i
jolly
well
skinned
your
ankle
why
do
you
let
yourself
be
drawn
by
everybody
draws
be
blowed
i
must
have
tickled
him
up
in
some
way
i
did
know
about
if
i
had
a
notion
of
that
before
of
course
i
could
have
rubbed
it
in
better
it
too
late
now
what
a
pity
side
what
he
drivin
at
never
mind
said
stalky
i
knew
we
could
make
it
a
happy
little
house
i
said
so
remember
but
i
swear
i
did
think
we
do
it
so
no
said
prout
most
firmly
in
i
maintain
that
gillett
is
wrong
true
i
let
them
return
to
their
with
your
known
views
on
cribbing
too
purred
little
hartopp
what
an
immoral
compromise
one
moment
said
the
reverend
john
i
we
all
of
us
have
exercised
an
absolutely
discretion
for
the
last
ten
days
now
we
want
to
know
confess
have
you
known
a
happy
minute
since
as
regards
my
house
i
have
not
said
prout
but
you
are
entirely
wrong
in
your
estimate
of
those
boys
in
justice
to
the
others
in
ha
i
said
it
would
come
to
that
murmured
the
reverend
john
i
was
forced
to
send
them
back
their
moral
influence
was
unspeakable
simply
and
bit
by
bit
he
told
his
tale
beginning
with
beetle
usury
and
ending
with
the
appeal
beetle
in
the
of
shylock
is
new
to
me
said
king
with
twitching
lips
i
heard
rumors
of
it
before
said
prout
no
after
you
had
dealt
with
them
but
i
was
careful
not
to
inquire
i
never
interfere
with
i
myself
said
hartopp
would
cheerfully
give
him
five
shillings
if
he
could
work
out
one
simple
sum
in
compound
interest
without
three
gross
why
why
why
mason
the
mathematical
master
stuttered
a
fierce
joy
on
his
face
you
been
had
precisely
the
same
as
me
and
so
you
held
an
inquiry
little
hartopp
voice
drowned
mason
ere
prout
caught
the
import
of
the
sentence
the
boy
himself
hinted
at
the
existence
of
a
deal
of
it
in
the
house
said
prout
he
is
past
master
in
that
line
said
the
chaplain
but
as
regards
the
honor
of
the
house
they
lowered
it
in
a
week
i
have
striven
to
build
it
up
for
years
my
own
and
boys
do
not
willingly
complain
of
each
other
besought
me
to
get
rid
of
them
you
say
you
have
their
confidence
gillett
they
may
tell
you
another
tale
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
they
may
go
to
the
devil
in
their
own
way
i
sick
and
tired
of
them
said
prout
bitterly
but
it
was
the
reverend
john
with
a
smiling
countenance
who
went
to
the
devil
just
after
number
five
had
cleared
away
a
very
pleasant
little
brew
it
cost
them
two
and
fourpence
and
was
settling
down
to
prep
come
in
padre
come
in
said
stalky
thrusting
forward
the
best
chair
we
only
met
you
these
last
ten
you
were
under
sentence
said
the
reverend
john
i
do
not
consort
with
ah
but
we
restored
again
said
mcturk
mr
prout
has
without
a
stain
on
our
characters
said
beetle
it
was
a
painful
episode
padre
most
now
consider
for
a
while
and
perpend
it
is
about
your
characters
that
i
called
in
the
language
of
the
schools
what
the
dooce
you
been
up
to
in
prout
house
it
is
anything
to
laugh
over
he
says
that
you
so
lowered
the
tone
of
the
house
he
had
to
pack
you
back
to
your
studies
is
that
true
every
word
of
it
do
be
flippant
turkey
listen
to
me
i
told
you
very
often
that
no
boys
in
the
school
have
a
greater
influence
for
good
or
evil
than
you
have
you
know
i
do
talk
about
ethics
and
moral
codes
because
i
do
believe
that
the
young
of
the
human
animal
realizes
what
they
mean
for
some
years
to
come
all
the
same
i
do
want
to
think
you
been
perverting
the
juniors
do
interrupt
beetle
listen
to
me
prout
has
a
notion
that
you
have
been
corrupting
your
associates
somehow
or
mr
prout
has
so
many
notions
padre
said
beetle
wearily
which
one
is
this
well
he
tells
me
that
he
heard
you
telling
a
story
in
the
twilight
in
the
in
a
whisper
and
orrin
said
just
as
he
opened
the
door
up
beetle
it
too
beastly
now
then
you
remember
oliphant
city
that
you
lent
me
last
term
said
beetle
the
padre
nodded
i
got
the
notion
out
of
that
only
instead
of
a
city
i
made
it
the
coll
in
a
fog
besieged
by
ghosts
of
dead
boys
who
hauled
chaps
out
of
their
beds
in
the
dormitory
all
the
names
are
quite
real
you
tell
it
in
a
whisper
you
know
with
the
names
orrin
did
like
it
one
little
bit
none
of
have
ever
let
me
finish
it
it
gets
just
awful
at
the
end
but
why
in
the
world
did
you
explain
to
prout
instead
of
leaving
him
under
the
impression
padre
sahib
said
mcturk
it
is
the
least
good
explainin
to
prout
if
he
has
one
impression
he
bound
to
have
he
do
it
with
the
best
o
motives
he
loco
purred
stalky
you
young
demons
the
reverend
john
replied
and
am
i
to
understand
that
the
usury
business
was
another
of
your
impressions
well
we
helped
a
little
in
that
said
stalky
i
did
owe
beetle
two
and
fourpence
at
least
beetle
says
i
did
but
i
never
intended
to
pay
him
then
we
started
a
bit
of
an
argument
on
the
stairs
and
and
prout
dropped
into
it
accidental
that
was
how
it
was
padre
he
paid
me
cash
down
like
a
giddy
dook
stopped
it
out
of
my
just
the
same
and
beetle
gave
him
my
all
correct
i
do
know
what
happened
after
i
was
too
truthful
said
beetle
i
always
am
you
see
he
was
under
an
impression
padre
and
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
corrected
that
impression
but
of
course
i
could
be
certain
that
his
house
was
given
over
to
could
i
i
thought
the
might
know
more
about
it
than
i
did
they
ought
to
they
giddy
palladiums
of
public
they
did
too
by
the
time
they
finished
said
mcturk
as
nice
a
pair
of
conscientious
upright
boys
as
ever
want
to
meet
padre
they
turned
the
house
upside
down
harrison
and
craye
the
best
motives
in
the
they
said
so
said
it
very
loud
and
clear
they
went
and
shouted
in
our
ear
said
stalky
my
own
private
impression
is
that
all
three
of
you
will
infallibly
be
hanged
said
the
reverend
john
why
we
did
do
anything
mcturk
replied
it
was
all
prout
did
you
ever
read
a
book
about
japanese
wrestlers
my
uncle
in
the
navy
gave
me
a
beauty
do
try
to
change
the
subject
i
not
sir
i
givin
an
illustration
same
as
a
sermon
these
have
got
sort
sort
of
trick
that
lets
the
other
chap
do
all
the
work
than
they
give
a
little
wriggle
and
he
upsets
himself
it
called
or
or
somethin
prout
a
it
is
our
did
you
suppose
we
went
round
corruptin
the
minds
of
the
fags
said
beetle
they
have
any
to
begin
with
and
if
they
had
corrupted
long
ago
i
been
a
fag
well
i
fancied
i
knew
the
normal
range
of
your
iniquities
but
if
you
take
so
much
trouble
to
pile
up
circumstantial
evidence
against
yourselves
you
ca
blame
any
one
if
we
do
blame
any
one
padre
we
have
said
a
word
against
prout
have
we
stalky
looked
at
the
others
we
love
him
he
has
a
notion
how
we
love
h
you
dissemble
your
love
very
well
have
you
ever
thought
who
got
you
turned
out
of
your
study
in
the
first
place
it
was
prout
turned
us
out
said
stalky
with
significance
well
i
was
that
man
i
did
mean
it
but
some
words
of
mine
afraid
gave
prout
the
impression
number
five
laughed
aloud
you
see
it
just
the
same
thing
with
you
padre
said
mcturk
he
is
quick
to
get
an
impression
ai
he
but
you
must
think
we
love
him
we
do
there
is
an
ounce
of
vice
about
a
double
knock
fell
on
the
door
the
head
to
see
number
five
study
in
his
study
at
once
said
the
voice
of
foxy
the
school
sergeant
whew
said
the
reverend
john
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
trouble
coming
for
some
my
word
prout
gone
and
told
the
head
said
stalky
he
a
moral
not
fair
luggin
the
head
into
a
i
should
recommend
a
on
a
h
safe
and
certain
part
said
the
reverend
john
disinterestedly
huh
he
licks
across
the
shoulders
an
it
would
slam
like
a
beastly
said
beetle
padre
we
in
for
once
more
they
stood
in
the
presence
of
the
head
belial
mammon
and
lucifer
but
they
had
to
deal
with
a
man
more
subtle
than
them
all
prout
had
talked
to
him
heavily
and
sadly
for
half
an
hour
and
the
head
had
seen
all
that
was
hidden
from
the
you
been
bothering
prout
he
said
pensively
are
here
to
be
bothered
by
boys
more
than
is
necessary
i
do
like
being
bothered
by
these
things
you
are
bothering
that
is
a
very
serious
offense
you
see
it
yes
well
now
i
purpose
to
bother
you
on
personal
and
private
grounds
because
you
have
broken
into
my
time
you
are
much
too
big
to
lick
so
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
mark
my
displeasure
in
some
other
way
say
a
thousand
lines
apiece
a
week
gating
and
a
few
things
of
that
kind
much
too
big
to
lick
are
you
oh
no
sir
said
stalky
cheerfully
for
a
week
gating
in
the
summer
term
is
serious
good
then
we
will
do
what
we
can
i
wish
you
would
bother
it
was
a
fair
sustained
equable
stroke
with
a
little
draw
to
it
but
what
they
felt
most
was
his
unfairness
in
stopping
to
talk
between
executions
thus
among
the
lower
classes
this
would
lay
me
open
to
a
charge
of
assault
you
should
be
more
grateful
for
your
privileges
than
you
are
there
is
a
limit
one
finds
it
by
experience
beetle
beyond
which
it
is
never
safe
to
pursue
private
vendettas
because
do
move
sooner
or
later
one
comes
into
collision
with
the
higher
authority
who
has
studied
the
animal
mcturk
please
arcadia
there
a
certain
flagrant
injustice
about
this
that
ought
to
appeal
to
your
temperament
and
that
all
you
will
tell
your
that
you
have
been
formally
caned
by
my
word
said
mcturk
wriggling
his
all
down
the
corridor
that
was
business
the
prooshan
bates
has
an
infernal
straight
was
it
wily
of
me
to
ask
for
the
lickin
said
stalky
instead
of
those
impots
rot
we
were
in
for
it
from
the
first
i
knew
the
look
of
his
old
eye
said
beetle
i
was
within
an
inch
of
well
i
did
exactly
smile
stalky
confessed
let
go
down
to
the
lavatory
and
have
a
look
at
the
damage
one
of
us
can
hold
the
glass
and
can
they
proceeded
on
these
lines
for
some
ten
minutes
the
wales
were
very
red
and
very
level
there
was
not
a
penny
to
choose
between
any
of
them
for
thoroughness
efficiency
and
a
certain
clarity
of
outline
that
stamps
the
work
of
the
artist
what
are
you
doing
down
there
prout
was
at
the
head
of
the
lavatory
stairs
attracted
by
the
noise
of
splashing
we
only
been
caned
by
the
head
sir
and
we
washing
off
the
blood
the
head
said
we
were
to
tell
you
we
were
coming
to
report
ourselves
in
a
minute
sir
that
a
score
for
heffy
well
he
deserves
to
score
something
poor
devil
said
mcturk
putting
on
his
shirt
we
sweated
a
stone
and
a
half
off
him
since
we
but
look
here
why
are
we
wrathy
with
the
head
he
said
it
was
a
flagrant
injustice
so
it
is
said
beetle
dear
man
said
mcturk
and
vouchsafed
no
further
answer
it
was
stalky
who
laughed
till
he
had
to
hold
on
by
the
edge
of
a
basin
you
a
funny
ass
what
that
for
said
beetle
i
i
thinking
of
the
flagrant
injustice
of
it
the
moral
reformers
there
was
no
disguising
the
defeat
the
victory
was
to
prout
but
they
grudged
it
not
if
he
had
broken
the
rules
of
the
game
by
calling
in
the
head
they
had
had
a
good
run
for
their
money
the
reverend
john
sought
the
earliest
opportunity
of
talking
things
over
members
of
a
bachelor
of
a
school
where
studies
are
designedly
dotted
among
studies
and
can
if
they
choose
see
a
great
deal
of
their
charges
number
five
had
spent
some
cautious
years
in
testing
the
reverend
john
he
was
emphatically
a
gentleman
he
knocked
at
a
study
door
before
entering
he
comported
himself
as
a
visitor
and
not
a
strayed
lictor
he
never
prosed
and
he
never
carried
over
into
official
life
the
confidences
of
idle
hours
prout
was
ever
an
unmitigated
nuisance
king
came
solely
as
an
avenger
of
blood
even
little
hartopp
talking
natural
history
seldom
forgot
his
office
but
the
reverend
john
was
a
guest
desired
and
beloved
by
number
five
behold
him
then
in
their
only
a
bent
briar
between
his
teeth
chin
down
in
three
folds
on
his
clerical
collar
and
blowing
like
an
amiable
whale
while
number
five
discoursed
of
life
as
it
appeared
to
them
and
specially
of
that
last
interview
with
the
head
in
the
matter
of
usury
one
licking
once
a
week
would
do
you
an
immense
amount
of
good
he
said
twinkling
and
shaking
all
over
and
as
you
say
you
were
entirely
in
the
padre
we
could
have
proved
it
if
he
let
us
talk
said
stalky
but
he
did
the
head
a
downy
he
understands
you
perfectly
ho
ho
well
you
worked
hard
enough
for
but
he
awfully
fair
he
does
lick
a
chap
in
the
morning
an
preach
at
him
in
the
afternoon
said
beetle
he
ca
he
ai
in
orders
thank
goodness
said
mcturk
number
five
held
the
very
strongest
views
on
clerical
and
were
ever
ready
to
meet
their
pastor
in
argument
almost
all
other
schools
have
clerical
heads
said
the
reverend
john
gently
it
is
fair
on
the
chaps
stalky
replied
makes
sulky
of
course
it
different
with
you
sir
you
belong
to
the
school
same
as
we
do
i
mean
ordinary
well
i
am
a
most
ordinary
clergyman
and
hartopp
in
orders
ye
es
but
he
took
after
he
came
to
the
coll
we
saw
him
go
up
for
his
exam
that
all
right
said
beetle
but
just
think
if
the
head
went
and
got
ordained
what
would
happen
beetle
oh
the
coll
go
to
pieces
in
a
year
sir
there
no
doubt
how
know
the
reverend
john
was
smiling
we
been
here
nearly
six
years
now
there
are
precious
few
things
about
the
coll
we
do
know
stalky
replied
why
even
you
came
the
term
after
i
did
sir
i
remember
your
asking
our
names
in
form
your
first
lesson
king
prout
and
the
head
of
course
are
the
only
masters
senior
to
us
in
that
yes
we
changed
a
good
deal
in
huh
said
beetle
with
a
grunt
they
came
here
an
they
went
away
to
get
married
jolly
good
riddance
too
does
our
beetle
hold
with
matrimony
no
padre
do
make
fun
of
me
i
met
chaps
in
the
holidays
got
married
it
perfectly
awful
they
have
babies
and
teething
and
measles
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
right
bung
the
school
and
the
masters
wives
give
padre
and
ask
the
chaps
to
that
do
matter
so
much
said
stalky
but
the
let
their
houses
alone
and
they
leave
everything
to
the
prefects
why
in
one
school
a
chap
told
me
there
were
big
baize
doors
and
a
passage
about
a
mile
long
between
the
house
and
the
master
house
they
could
do
just
what
they
satan
rebuking
sin
with
a
oh
larks
are
right
enough
but
you
know
what
we
mean
padre
after
a
bit
it
gets
worse
an
worse
then
there
a
big
and
a
row
that
gets
into
the
papers
and
a
lot
of
chaps
are
expelled
you
always
the
wrong
un
do
forget
that
have
a
cup
of
cocoa
padre
said
mcturk
with
the
kettle
no
thanks
i
smoking
always
the
wrong
my
and
then
stalky
warmed
to
the
work
everybody
says
thought
it
shockin
boys
wicked
little
kids
it
all
comes
of
married
a
daniel
come
to
but
it
does
mcturk
interrupted
i
met
chaps
in
the
holidays
they
told
me
the
same
thing
it
looks
awfully
pretty
for
one
people
to
see
a
nice
separate
house
with
a
nice
lady
in
charge
an
all
that
but
it
is
it
takes
the
off
their
work
and
it
gives
the
prefects
a
heap
too
much
power
an
an
it
rots
up
everything
you
see
it
is
as
if
we
were
just
an
ordinary
school
we
take
rejections
as
well
as
good
little
boys
like
stalky
we
got
to
do
that
to
make
our
name
of
course
and
we
get
into
sandhurst
somehow
or
other
do
we
true
o
turk
like
a
book
thou
talkest
and
so
we
want
rather
different
masters
do
you
think
so
to
other
places
we
are
like
the
rest
of
the
it
leads
to
all
sorts
of
bullyin
too
a
chap
told
me
said
beetle
well
you
need
most
of
a
single
man
time
i
must
the
reverend
john
considered
his
hosts
critically
but
do
you
never
feel
that
the
world
the
is
too
much
with
you
sometimes
not
exactly
in
summer
stalky
eye
roved
contentedly
to
the
window
our
bounds
are
pretty
big
too
and
they
leave
us
to
ourselves
a
good
for
example
here
am
i
sitting
in
your
study
very
much
in
your
way
eh
indeed
you
are
padre
sit
down
do
go
sir
you
know
we
glad
whenever
you
there
was
no
doubting
the
sincerity
of
the
voices
the
reverend
john
flushed
a
little
with
pleasure
and
refilled
his
briar
and
we
generally
know
where
the
are
said
beetle
triumphantly
did
you
come
through
our
lower
dormitories
last
night
after
ten
sir
i
went
to
smoke
a
pipe
with
your
no
i
did
give
him
any
impressions
i
took
a
short
cut
through
your
i
sniffed
a
whiff
of
this
mornin
yours
is
stronger
than
prout
knew
said
beetle
wagging
his
head
good
heavens
said
the
reverend
john
absently
it
was
some
years
before
beetle
perceived
that
this
was
rather
a
tribute
to
innocence
than
observation
the
long
light
blindless
dormitories
devoid
of
inner
doors
were
crossed
at
all
hours
of
the
night
by
masters
visiting
one
another
for
bachelors
sit
up
later
than
married
folk
beetle
had
never
dreamed
that
there
might
be
a
purpose
in
this
steady
policing
talking
about
bullying
the
reverend
john
resumed
you
all
caught
it
pretty
hot
when
you
were
fags
did
you
well
we
must
have
been
rather
awful
little
beasts
said
beetle
looking
serenely
over
the
gulf
between
eleven
and
sixteen
my
hat
what
bullies
they
were
then
fairburn
maunsell
and
all
that
gang
when
called
us
the
three
blind
mice
and
we
had
to
get
up
on
the
lockers
and
sing
while
he
buzzed
at
us
said
stalky
they
bullies
if
you
like
but
there
is
any
of
it
now
said
mcturk
soothingly
that
where
you
make
a
mistake
we
all
inclined
to
say
that
everything
is
all
right
as
long
we
are
ourselves
hurt
i
sometimes
wonder
if
it
is
extinct
fags
bully
each
other
horrid
but
the
upper
forms
are
supposed
to
be
swottin
for
exams
they
got
something
else
to
think
about
said
beetle
why
what
do
you
think
stalky
was
watching
the
chaplain
face
i
have
my
then
explosively
on
my
word
for
three
moderately
intelligent
boys
you
are
very
observant
i
suppose
you
were
too
busy
making
things
warm
for
your
to
see
what
lay
under
your
noses
when
you
were
in
the
last
week
what
sir
i
i
swear
we
did
see
anything
said
beetle
then
i
advise
you
to
look
when
a
little
chap
is
whimpering
in
a
corner
and
wears
his
clothes
like
rags
and
never
does
any
work
and
is
notoriously
the
dirtiest
little
in
the
something
wrong
that
clewer
said
mcturk
under
his
breath
yes
clewer
he
comes
to
me
for
his
french
it
his
first
term
and
he
almost
as
complete
a
wreck
as
you
were
beetle
he
not
naturally
clever
but
he
has
been
hammered
till
he
nearly
an
oh
no
they
sham
silly
to
get
off
more
tickings
said
beetle
know
i
never
actually
seen
him
knocked
about
said
the
reverend
john
the
genuine
article
do
do
that
in
public
said
beetle
fairburn
never
touched
me
when
any
one
was
looking
you
need
swagger
about
it
beetle
said
mcturk
we
all
caught
it
in
our
but
i
got
it
worse
than
any
one
said
beetle
if
you
want
an
authority
on
bullyin
padre
come
to
me
corkscrews
keys
rockin
ag
ags
and
all
the
rest
of
yes
i
do
want
you
as
an
authority
or
rather
i
want
your
authority
to
stop
it
all
of
what
about
abana
and
pharpar
padre
harrison
and
craye
they
are
prout
pets
said
mcturk
a
little
bitterly
we
are
even
i
considered
that
but
on
the
other
hand
since
most
bullying
is
mere
thoughtlessness
not
one
little
bit
of
it
padre
said
mcturk
bullies
like
bullyin
they
mean
it
they
think
it
up
in
lesson
and
practise
it
in
the
never
mind
if
the
thing
goes
up
to
the
prefects
it
may
make
another
you
had
one
already
do
laugh
listen
to
me
i
ask
you
my
own
tenth
legion
to
take
the
thing
up
quietly
i
want
little
clewer
made
to
look
fairly
clean
and
decent
blowed
if
wash
him
whispered
stalky
decent
and
as
for
the
other
boy
whoever
he
is
you
can
use
your
influence
a
purely
secular
light
flickered
in
the
chaplain
eye
in
any
way
you
please
to
to
dissuade
him
that
all
i
leave
it
to
you
well
what
are
we
goin
to
do
number
five
stared

they
drew
the
house
accounting
for
every
junior
and
senior
against
whom
they
had
suspicions
investigated
at
beetle
suggestion
the
lavatories
and
but
without
result
everybody
seemed
to
be
present
save
clewer
rum
said
stalky
pausing
outside
a
study
door
golly
a
thin
piping
mixed
with
tears
came
muffled
through
the
panels
beautiful
kitty
one
morning
was
tripping
louder
you
young
devil
or
i
buzz
a
book
at
you
a
pitcher
of
milk
oh
campbell
do
the
fair
of
a
book
crashed
on
something
soft
and
squeals
arose
well
i
never
thought
it
was
a
anyhow
that
accounts
for
our
not
spotting
him
said
beetle
sefton
and
campbell
are
rather
hefty
chaps
to
tackle
besides
one
ca
go
into
their
study
like
a
what
swine
mcturk
listened
where
the
fun
of
it
i
suppose
clewer
faggin
for
they
are
prefects
that
one
good
job
said
stalky
with
his
sefton
and
campbell
um
campbell
and
sefton
ah
one
of
a
crammer
the
two
were
precocious
hairy
youths
between
seventeen
and
eighteen
sent
to
the
school
in
despair
by
parents
who
hoped
that
six
steady
cram
might
perhaps
jockey
them
into
sandhurst
nominally
they
were
in
prout
house
actually
they
were
under
the
head
eye
and
since
he
was
very
careful
never
to
promote
strange
new
boys
to
prefectships
they
considered
they
had
a
grievance
against
the
school
sefton
had
spent
three
months
with
a
london
crammer
and
the
tale
of
his
adventures
there
lost
nothing
in
the
telling
campbell
who
had
a
fine
taste
in
clothes
and
a
fluent
vocabulary
followed
his
lead
in
looking
down
loftily
on
the
rest
of
the
world
this
was
only
their
second
term
and
the
school
used
to
what
it
profanely
called
crammers
pups
had
treated
them
with
rather
galling
reserve
but
their
whiskers
sefton
owned
a
real
razor
and
their
mustaches
were
beyond
question
impressive
shall
we
go
in
an
dissuade
mcturk
asked
i
never
had
much
to
do
with
but
i
bet

of

swiftly
and
scientifically

thrust
through
the
natural
crooks

the
wrists
tied
with
to
an
accompaniment
of
insults
from

voluble
behind

most
helpless
thing
in

in
turn
they
knew
their
work
because

echoed
at
the
twentieth
repetition
no
boy
can
stand
the
torture
of
one
unvarying
query
which
is
the
essence
of
bullying
came
confession
we
did
confound
you
then
you
be
knuckled
and
knuckled
they
were
according
to
ancient
experience

no
trifle
molly
fairburn
of
the
old
days
could
not
have
done
better
did
you
give
clewer
this
time
the
question
was
answered
sooner
and
was
dealt
out
for
the
space
of
five
minutes
by
stalky
watch
they
could
not
even
writhe
in
their
bonds
no
brush
is
employed
in
did
you
give
clewer
the
key
no
we
did
i
swear
we
did
from
campbell
rolling
in
agony
then
we
give
it
to
you
so
you
can
see
what
it
would
be
like
if
you
the
torture
of
the
key
which
has
no
key
at
all
hurts
excessively
they
endured
several
minutes
of
it
and
their
language
necessitated
the
gag
did
you
give
clewer
corkscrews
yes
oh
curse
your
silly
souls

us
alone
you
they
were
corkscrewed
and
the
torture
of
the
corkscrew
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
corkscrews
is
keener
than
the
torture
of
the
key
the
method
and
silence
of
the
attacks
was
breaking
their
nerves
between
each
new
torture
came
the
pitiless
dazing
rain
of
questions
and
when
they
did
not
answer
to
the
point
handkerchiefs
were
thrust
into
their
mouths
now
are
those
all
the
things
you

said
stalky
from
the
floor
sefton
made
unconditional
surrender
more
abjectly
even
than
campbell
he
would
never
touch
any
one
again
he
would
go
softly
all
the
days
of
his
life
we

they
dropped
into
chairs
luxuriously
campbell
and
sefton
looked
at
each
other
and
neither
taking
comfort
from
that
view
struck
up
kitty
of
vile
bad
said
stalky
as
the
miserable
wailing
ended
if
you
surrendered
it
would
have
been
our
painful
duty
to
buzz
books
at
you
for
singin
out
o
tune
now
he
freed
them
from
their
bonds
but
for
several
minutes
they
could
not
rise
campbell
was
first
on
his
feet
smiling
uneasily
sefton
staggered
to
the
table
buried
his
head
in
his
arms
and
shook
with
sobs
there
was
no
shadow
of
fight
in
either
only
amazement
distress
and
shame
ca
ca
he
shave
clean
before
tea
please
said
campbell
it
ten
minutes
to
stalky
shook
his
head
he
meant
to
escort
the
one
to
the
meal
mcturk
yawned
in
his
chair
and
beetle
mopped
his
face
they
were
all
dripping
with
excitement
and
exertion
if
i
knew
anything
about
it
i
swear
i
give
you
a
moral
lecture
said
stalky
severely
do
jaw
they
surrendered
said
mcturk
this
moral
suasion
biznai
takes
it
out
of
a
do
you
see
how
gentle
we
been
we
might
have
called
clewer
in
to
look
at
you
said
stalky
bleatin
of
the
tiger
excites
the
kid
but
we
did
we
only
got
to
tell
a
few
chaps
in
coll
about
this
and
you
be
hooted
all
over
the
shop
your
life
would
be
worth
havin
but
we
are
goin
to
do
that
either
we
strictly
moral
suasers
campbell
so
unless
you
or
seffy
split
about
this
no
one
i
swear
you
a
brick
said
campbell
i
suppose
i
was
rather
a
brute
to
it
looked
like
it
said
stalky
but
i
do
think
seffy
need
come
into
hall
with
whiskers
horrid
bad
for
the
fags
if
they
saw
him
he
can
shave
ai
you
grateful
sefton
the
head
did
not
lift
sefton
was
deeply
asleep
that
rummy
said
mcturk
as
a
snore
mixed
with
a
sob
think
or
else
he
no
is
said
beetle
fairburn
had
attended
to
me
for
an
hour
or
so
i
used
to
go
bung
off
to
sleep
on
a
form
sometimes
poor
devil
but
he
called
me
a
beastly
poet
well
come
stalky
lowered
his
voice
campbell
if
you
do
talk
nobody
there
should
have
been
a
but
that
all
three
were
so
utterly
tired
that
they
almost
went
to
sleep
above
the
in
their
study
and
slept
till
prep
a
most
extraordinary
letter
are
all
parents
incurably
mad
what
do
you
make
of
it
said
the
head
handing
a
closely
written
eight
pages
to
the
reverend
john
only
son
of
his
mother
and
she
a
widow
that
is
the
least
reasonable
the
chaplain
read
with
pursed
lips
if
half
those
charges
are
true
he
should
be
in
the
whereas
he
is
disgustingly
well
certainly
he
has
shaved
i
noticed
under
compulsion
as
his
mother
points
out
how
delicious
how
salutary
you
have
to
answer
her
it
is
often
i
do
know
what
has
happened
in
the
school
but
this
is
beyond
if
you
asked
me
i
should
say
seek
not
to
propitiate
when
one
is
forced
to
take
crammers
pups
he
was
perfectly
well
at
with
me
this
morning
said
the
head
absently
unusually
well
behaved
they
either
educate
the
school
or
the
school
as
in
this
case
educates
them
i
prefer
our
own
methods
the
chaplain
concluded
you
think
it
was
that
a
lift
of
the
head
i
sure
of
it
and
nothing
excuses
his
trying
to
give
the
college
a
bad
that
the
line
i
mean
to
take
with
him
the
head
answered
the
augurs
winked
a
few
days
later
the
reverend
john
called
on
number
five
why
we
seen
you
before
padre
said
they
i
been
watching
times
and
seasons
and
events
and
men
and
boys
he
replied
i
am
pleased
with
my
tenth
legion
i
make
them
my
compliments
clewer
was
throwing
in
form
this
morning
instead
of
doing
his
work
he
is
now
doing
fifty
lines
for
you
ca
blame
us
sir
said
beetle
you
told
us
to
remove
the

pressure
that
the
worst
of
a
i
known
boys
five
years
his
senior
throw
beetle
to
such
an
one
have
i
given
two
hundred
lines
not
so
long
ago
and
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
were
those
lines
ever
shown
up
were
they
turkey
said
beetle
unblushingly
do
you
think
clewer
looks
a
little
cleaner
padre
stalky
interrupted
we
no
end
of
moral
reformers
said
mcturk
it
was
all
stalky
but
it
was
a
lark
said
beetle
i
have
noticed
the
moral
reform
in
several
quarters
did
i
tell
you
you
had
more
influence
than
any
boys
in
the
coll
if
you
cared
to
use
it
it
a
trifle
exhaustin
to
use
frequent
our
kind
of
moral
suasion
besides
you
see
it
only
makes
clewer
i
was
thinking
of
clewer
i
was
thinking
of
the
other
people
oh
we
did
bother
much
about
the
other
people
said
mcturk
did
we
but
did
from
the
then
you
knew
sir
a
downward
puff
of
smoke
boys
educate
each
other
they
say
more
than
we
can
or
dare
if
i
had
used
one
half
of
the
moral
suasion
you
may
or
may
not
have
employed
with
the
best
motives
in
the
world
do
forget
our
pious
motives
padre
said
mcturk
i
suppose
i
should
be
now
languishing
in
bideford
jail
should
i
well
to
quote
the
head
in
a
little
business
which
we
have
agreed
to
forget
that
strikes
me
as
flagrant
injustice
what
are
you
laughing
at
you
young
sinners
is
it
true
i
will
not
stay
to
be
shouted
at
what
i
looked
into
this
den
of
iniquity
for
was
to
find
out
if
any
one
cared
to
come
down
for
a
bathe
off
the
ridge

i

easter
term
was
but
a
month
old
when
stettson
major
a
contracted
diphtheria
and
the
head
was
very
angry
he
decreed
a
new
and
narrower
set
of
bounds
the
infection
had
been
traced
to
an
farmhouse
urged
the
prefects
severely
to
lick
all
trespassers
and
promised
extra
attentions
from
his
own
hand
there
were
no
words
bad
enough
for
stettson
major
quarantined
at
his
mother
house
who
had
lowered
the
of
health
this
he
said
in
the
gymnasium
after
prayers
then
he
wrote
some
two
hundred
letters
to
as
many
anxious
parents
and
guardians
and
bade
the
school
carry
on
the
trouble
did
not
spread
but
one
night

drove
to
the

door
and
in
the
morning
the
head
had
gone
leaving
all

charge
of

often
ran
up
to
town
where
the
school
devoutly
believed
he
bribed
officials
for
early
proofs
of
the
army
examination
papers
but
this
absence
was
unusually
prolonged

jerking
his

walking
swiftly

how
it
feels
to
be
shot
and
all
that
said
stalky
as
they
splashed
down
a
lane
where
did
it
happen
beetle
oh
out
in
india
somewhere
we
always
rowin
there
but
look
here
stalky
what

your
uncle
stalky
get
you
into
a
mess
yet
like
many
other
leaders
stalky
did
not
dwell
on
past
defeats
they
pushed
through
a
dripping
hedge
landed
among
clods
and
sat
down
on
a
harrow
the
cheroot
burned
with
sputterings
of
saltpetre
they
smoked
it
gingerly
each
passing
to
the
other
between
closed
forefinger
and
thumb
good
job
we
had
one
apiece
ai
it
said
stalky
shivering
through
set
teeth
to
prove
his
words
he
immediately
laid
all
before
them
and
they
followed
his
example
i
told
you
moaned
beetle
sweating
clammy
drops
oh
stalky
you
are
a
fool
mcturk
handed
up
his
contribution
and
lay
hopelessly
on
the
cold
iron
something
wrong
with
the
beastly
thing
i
say
beetle
have
you
been
droppin
ink
on
it
but
beetle
was
in
no
case
to
answer
limp
and
empty
they
sprawled
across
the
harrow
the
rust
marking
their
ulsters
in
red
squares
and
the
abandoned
reeking
under
their
very
cold
noses
then
they
had
heard
nothing
the
head
himself
stood
before
them
the
head
who
should
have
been
in
town
bribing
examiners
the
head
fantastically
attired
in
old
tweeds
and
a
ah

said
fingering
his
mustache
very
good
i
might
have
guessed
who
it
was

go
back
to
the
college
and
give
my
compliments
to

five
hundred
lines
by
five
you
are
also
gated
for
a
week
this
is
not
exactly
the
time
for
breaking
bounds
he
disappeared
over
the
hedge
as
lightly
as
he
had
come
there
was
a
murmur
of
women
voices
in
the
deep
lane
oh
you
prooshan
brute
said
mcturk
as
the
voices
died
away
stalky
it
all
your
silly
kill
him

him
gasped
beetle
i
i
going
to
cat
again
i
do
mind
that
but
gloat
over
us
horrid
ooh
stalky
made
no
answer
not
even
a
soft
one
they
went
to
college
and
received
that
for
which
they
had
been
sent
king
enjoyed
himself
most
thoroughly
for
by
virtue
of
their
seniority
the
boys
were
exempt
from
his
hand
save
under
special
order
luckily
he
was
no
expert
in
the
gentle
art
how
desire
doth
outrun
performance
said
beetle
irreverently
quoting
from
some
shakespeare
play
that
they
were
cramming
that
term
they
regained
their
study
and
settled
down
to
the
imposition
you
quite
right
stalky
spoke
in
silky
and
propitiating
tones
now
if
the
head
had
sent
us
up
to
a
prefect
we
have
got
something
to
remember
look
here
mcturk
began
with
cold
venom
we
are
goin
to
row
you
about
this
business
because

too
bad
for

row
but
we
want

plain
how

in
those
ghastly
clothes

severely
well
it
was
all
stettson
major
fault
if
he

but
do
you
think
it
rather
rummy
the
head
droppin
on
us
that
way
shut
up
you

said
beetle
we
chopped
your
spurs
off
your
beastly
heels
we
cocked
your
shield
upside
down
and
i
think
you
ought
to
be
allowed
to
brew
for
a
oh
stop
jawin
at
me
i
want
stop
why
why
we
gated
for
a
mcturk
almost
howled
as
the
agony
of
the
situation
overcame
him
a
lickin
from
king
five
hundred
lines
a
gatin
expect
us
to
kiss
you
stalky
you
beast
drop
rottin

well
and
fit

makin
love
to
stettson
major
mother
that
was
her
in
the
lane
i
heard

and
so
we
were
ordered
a
lickin
before
a
mother
bony
old
widow
too
said
mcturk
anything

you
like
to
find

i
do
care
i
swear
i
get
even
with
him
some
day
stalky
growled
looks
like
it
said
mcturk
week
gatin
and
five
hundred
and
now
you
goin
to
row
about
it
help
scrag
him
beetle
stalky
had
thrown
his
virgil
at
them
the
head
returned
next
day
without
explanation
to
find
the
lines
waiting
for
him
and
the
school
a
little
relaxed
under
viceroyalty
king
had
been
talking
at
and
round
and
over
the
heads
in
a
lofty
and
promiscuous
style
of
spirit
and
the
traditions
of
ancient
seats
for
he
always
improved
an
occasion
beyond
waking
in
two
hundred
and
fifty
young
hearts
a
lively
hatred
of
all
other
foundations
he
accomplished
little
so
little
indeed
that
when
two
days
after
the
head
return
he
chanced
to
come
across
stalky
gated
but
ever
resourceful
playing
marbles
in
the
corridor
he
said
that
he
was
not
surprised
not
in
the
least
surprised
this
was
what
he
had
expected
from
persons
of
their
but
there
is
any
rule
against
marbles
sir
very
interestin
game
said
beetle
his
knees
white
with
chalk
and
dust
then
he
received
two
hundred
lines
for
insolence
besides
an
order
to
go
to
the
nearest
prefect
for
judgment
and
slaughter
this
is
what
happened
behind
the
closed
doors
of
flint
study
and
flint
was
then
head
of
the
games
oh
i
say
flint
king
has
sent
me
to
you
for
playin
marbles
in
the
corridor
an
shoutin
tor
an
down
what
does
he
suppose
i
have
to
do
with
that
was
the
answer
dunno
well
beetle
grinned
wickedly
what
am
i
to
tell
him
rather
wrathy
about
if
the
head
chooses
to
put
a
notice
in
the
corridor
forbiddin
marbles
i
can
do
something
but
i
ca
move
on
a
report
he
knows
that
as
well
as
i
the
sense
of
this
oracle
beetle
conveyed
all
unsweetened
to
king
who
hastened
to
interview
flint
now
flint
had
been
seven
and
a
half
years
at
the
college
counting
six
months
with
a
london
crammer
from
whose
roof
he
had
returned
homesick
to
the
head
for
the
final
army
polish
there
were
four
or
five
other
seniors
who
had
gone
through
much
the
same
mill
not
to
mention
boys
rejected
by
other
establishments
on
account
of
a
certain
overwhelmingness
whom
the
head
had
wrought
into
very
fair
shape
it
was
not
a
sixth
to
be
handled
without
gloves
as
king
found
am
i
to
understand
it
is
your
intention
to
allow
games
under
your
study
windows
flint
if
so
i
can
only
say
he
said
much
and
flint
listened
politely
well
sir
if
the
head
sees
fit
to
call
a
prefects
meeting
we
are
bound
to
take
the
matter
up
but
the
tradition
of
the
school
is
that
the
prefects
ca
move
in
any
matter
affecting
the
whole
school
without
the
head
direct
much
more
was
then
delivered
both
sides
a
little
losing
their
temper
after
tea
at
an
informal
gathering
of
prefects
in
his
study
flint
related
the
adventure
he
been
playin
for
this
for
a
week
and
now
he
got
it
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
if
he
had
been
gassing
at
us
the
way
he
has
that
young
devil
beetle
would
have
dreamed
of
we
know
that
said
perowne
but
that
is
the
question
on
flint
showin
king
has
called
the
prefects
names
enough
to
justify
a
row
crammers
rejections
was
it
now
it
impossible
for
prefects
rot
said
flint
king
the
best
classical
cram
we
got
and
fair
to
bother
the
head
with
a
row
he
up
to
his
eyes
with
and
army
work
as
it
is
besides
as
i
told
king
we
a
public
school
we
a
limited
liability
company
payin
four
per
cent
my
father
a
shareholder
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
said
venner
a
boy
of
nineteen
well
seems
to
me
that
we
should
be
interferin
with
ourselves
got
to
get
into
the
army
or
get
out
have
we
king
hired
by
the
council
to
teach
us
all
the
rest
gumdiddle
ca
you
see
it
might
have
been
because
he
felt
the
air
was
a
little
thunderous
that
the
head
took
his
cheroot
to
flint
study
but
he
so
often
began
an
evening
in
a
prefect
room
that
nobody
suspected
when
he
drifted
in
pensively
after
the
knocks
that
etiquette
demanded
prefects
meeting
a
cock
of
one
wise
not
exactly
sir
we
just
talking
things
over
wo
you
take
the
easy
chair
thanks
luxurious
infants
you
he
dropped
into
flint
big
and
puffed
for
a
while
in
silence
well
since
you
all
here
i
may
confess
that
i
the
mute
with
the
the
young
faces
grew
serious
the
phrase
meant
that
certain
of
their
number
would
be
withdrawn
from
all
further
games
for
it
might
also
mean
future
success
at
sandhurst
but
it
was
present
ruin
for
the
first
fifteen
yes
i
come
for
my
pound
of
flesh
i
ought
to
have
had
you
out
before
the
exeter
match
but
it
our
sacred
duty
to
beat
is
the
old
boys
match
sacred
too
sir
said
perowne
the
old
boys
match
was
the
event
of
the
easter
term
we
hope
they
are
in
training
now
for
the
list
first
i
want
flint
it
the
euclid
that
does
it
you
must
work
deductions
with
me
perowne
extra
mechanical
drawing
dawson
goes
to
king
for
extra
latin
and
venner
to
me
for
german
have
i
damaged
the
first
fifteen
much
he
smiled
sweetly
ruined
it
i
afraid
sir
said
flint
ca
you
let
us
off
till
the
end
of
the
term
impossible
it
will
be
a
tight
squeeze
for
sandhurst
this
and
all
to
be
cut
up
by
those
vile
afghans
too
said
dawson
would
think
there
be
so
much
competition
would
you
oh
that
reminds
me
crandall
is
coming
down
with
the
old
boys
asked
twenty
of
them
but
we
sha
get
more
than
a
weak
team
i
know
whether
he
be
much
use
though
he
was
rather
knocked
about
recovering
poor
old
duncan
crandall
major
the
gunner
perowne
asked
no
the
minor
crandall
in
a
native
infantry
regiment
he
was
almost
before
your
time
the
papers
did
say
anything
about
him
we
read
about
of
course
what
crandall
done
sir
i
brought
over
an
indian
paper
that
his
mother
sent
me
it
was
rather
a
hefty
i
think
you
say
piece
of
work
shall
i
read
it
the
head
knew
how
to
read
when
he
had
finished
the
of
close
type
everybody
thanked
him
politely
good
for
the
old
coll
said
perowne
pity
he
was
in
time
to
save
though
that
nine
to
us
is
it
in
the
last
three
years
yes
and
i
took
old
duncan
off
all
games
for
five
years
ago
this
term
said
the
head
by
the
way
who
do
you
hand
over
the
games
to
flint
have
thought
yet
who
you
recommend
sir
no
thank
you
i
heard
it
casually
hinted
behind
my
back
that
the
prooshan
bates
is
a
downy
bird
but
he
is
going
to
make
himself
responsible
for
a
new
head
of
the
games
settle
it
among
yourselves
and
that
the
man
said
flint
when
the
door
shut
that
you
want
to
bother
with
a
dame
school
i
was
only
pullin
your
fat
leg
perowne
returned
hastily
you
so
easy
to
draw
well
never
mind
that
the
head
knocked
the
first
fifteen
to
bits
and
we
got
to
pick
up
the
pieces
or
the
old
boys
will
have
a
let
promote
all
the
second
fifteen
and
make
big
side
play
up
there
heaps
of
talent
somewhere
that
we
can
polish
up
between
now
and
the
the
case
was
represented
so
urgently
to
the
school
that
even
stalky
and
mcturk
who
affected
to
despise
football
played
one
game
seriously
they
were
forthwith
promoted
ere
their
ardor
had
time
to
cool
and
the
dignity
of
their
caps
demanded
that
they
should
keep
some
show
of
virtue
the
was
worked
at
least
four
days
out
of
seven
and
the
school
saw
hope
ahead
with
the
last
week
of
the
term
the
old
boys
began
to
arrive
and
their
welcome
was
nicely
proportioned
to
their
worth
gentlemen
cadets
from
sandhurst
and
woolwich
who
had
only
left
a
year
ago
but
who
carried
enormous
side
were
greeted
with
a
cheerful
hullo
what
the
shop
like
from
those
who
had
shared
their
studies
militia
subalterns
had
more
consideration
but
it
was
understood
they
were
not
precisely
of
the
true
metal
recreants
who
failing
for
the
army
had
gone
into
business
or
banks
were
received
for
old
sake
sake
but
in
no
way
made
too
much
of
but
when
the
real
subalterns
officers
and
gentlemen
who
had
been
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
back
again
and
so
carried
no
side
came
on
the
scene
strolling
about
with
the
head
the
school
divided
right
and
left
in
admiring
silence
and
when
one
laid
hands
on
flint
even
upon
the
head
of
the
games
crying
good
heavens
what
do
you
mean
by
growing
in
this
way
you
were
a
beastly
little
fag
when
i
left
visible
haloes
encircled
flint
they
would
walk
to
and
fro
in
the
corridor
with
the
little
red
telling
news
of
old
regiments
they
would
burst
into
sniffing
the
smells
of
ink
and
whitewash
they
would
find
nephews
and
cousins
in
the
lower
forms
and
present
them
with
enormous
wealth
or
they
would
invade
the
gymnasium
and
make
foxy
show
off
the
new
stock
on
the
bars
chiefly
though
they
talked
with
the
head
who
was
and
to
them
all
for
what
they
shouted
in
their
unthinking
youth
they
proved
in
their
thoughtless
manhood
to
wit
that
the
prooshan
bates
was
a
downy
young
blood
who
had
stumbled
into
an
entanglement
with
a
daughter
at
plymouth
experience
who
had
come
into
a
small
legacy
but
mistrusted
lawyers
ambition
halting
at
anxious
to
take
the
one
that
would
lead
him
farthest
extravagance
pursued
by
the
arrogance
in
the
thick
of
a
regimental
row
each
carried
his
trouble
to
the
head
and
chiron
showed
him
in
language
quite
unfit
for
little
boys
a
quiet
and
safe
way
round
out
or
under
so
they
overflowed
his
house
smoked
his
cigars
and
drank
his
health
as
they
had
drunk
it
all
the
earth
over
when
two
or
three
of
the
old
school
had
foregathered
do
stop
smoking
for
a
minute
said
the
head
the
more
you
out
of
training
the
better
for
us
i
demoralized
the
first
fifteen
with
ah
but
we
a
scratch
lot
have
you
told
we
shall
need
a
substitute
even
if
crandall
can
play
said
a
lieutenant
of
engineers
with
a
to
his
credit
he
wrote
me
he
play
so
he
ca
have
been
much
hurt
he
coming
down
crandall
minor
that
was
and
brought
off
poor
duncan
body
the
head
nodded
where
are
you
going
to
put
him
we
turned
you
out
of
house
and
home
already
head
this
was
a
squadron
commander
of
bengal
lancers
home
on
leave
i
afraid
he
have
to
go
up
to
his
old
dormitory
you
know
old
boys
can
claim
that
privilege
yes
i
think
little
crandall
minor
must
bed
down
there
once
bates
sahib
a
gunner
flung
a
heavy
arm
round
the
neck
you
got
something
up
your
sleeve
confess
i
know
that
ca
you
see
you
cuckoo
a
submarine
miner
interrupted
crandall
goes
up
to
the
dormitory
as
an
for
moral
effect
and
so
forth
is
that
true
head
sahib
it
is
you
know
too
much
purvis
i
licked
you
for
that
in
you
did
sir
and
it
my
private
belief
you
chalked
the
but
i
a
very
straight
eye
perhaps
that
misled
that
opened
the
of
fresh
memories
and
they
all
told
tales
out
of
school
when
crandall
minor
that
was
lieutenant
crandall
of
an
ordinary
indian
regiment
arrived
from
exeter
on
the
morning
of
the
match
he
was
cheered
along
the
whole
front
of
the
college
for
the
prefects
had
repeated
the
sense
of
that
which
the
head
had
read
them
in
study
when
prout
house
understood
that
he
would
claim
his
old
right
to
a
bed
for
one
night
beetle
ran
into
king
house
next
door
and
executed
a
public
gloat
up
and
down
the
enemy
big
departing
in
a
haze
of
what
take
any
notice
of
those
rotters
for
said
stalky
playing
substitute
for
the
old
boys
magnificent
in
black
jersey
white
knickers
and
black
stockings
i
talked
to
up
in
the
dormitory
when
he
was
changin
pulled
his
sweater
down
for
him
he
cut
about
all
over
the
arms
horrid
purply
ones
he
goin
to
tell
us
about
it
i
asked
him
to
when
i
was
lacin
his
well
you
got
cheek
said
beetle
enviously
slipped
out
before
i
thought
but
he
was
a
bit
angry
he
no
end
of
a
chap
i
swear
i
goin
to
play
up
like
beans
tell
turkey
the
technique
of
that
match
belongs
to
a
bygone
age
scrimmages
were
tight
and
enduring
hacking
was
direct
and
to
the
purpose
and
around
the
scrimmage
stood
the
school
crying
put
down
your
heads
and
shove
toward
the
end
everybody
lost
all
sense
of
decency
and
mothers
of
too
close
to
the
heard
language
not
included
in
the
bills
no
one
was
actually
carried
off
the
field
but
both
sides
felt
happier
when
time
was
called
and
beetle
helped
stalky
and
mcturk
into
their
overcoats
the
two
had
met
in
the
heart
of
things
and
as
stalky
said
had
done
each
other
as
they
swaggered
woodenly
behind
the
teams
substitutes
do
not
rank
as
equals
of
hairy
men
they
passed
a
near
the
wall
and
a
husky
voice
cried
well
played
oh
played

it
was
stettson
major
and
who
had
fought
his
way
to
the
ground
under
escort

impatient
coachman

my
throat
and
the
head
sucked
out

ugh

the
doctor
said
so
he
stayed
on
at
our
house
instead

croaked
in
another
twenty
minutes
the
doctor
here

coachman

in
the
small
of
his
back

him
into
stalky

hung
and
the
head

to
get
the
said
stalky
why
he
might
have
been
dead
buried
by
now
but
he
was
but
he
did
ho

he
just
nipped
through
the
hedge
like
a
lusty
old
blackbird
five
hundred
lines
an
gated
for
a
week
all
sereno
i
read
o
somethin
like
that
in
a
book
said
beetle
gummy
what
a
chap
just
think
of
it
i
thinking
said
mcturk
and
he
delivered
a
wild
irish
yell
that
made
the
team
turn
round
shut
your
fat
mouth
said
stalky
dancing
with
impatience
leave
it
to
your
uncle
stalky
and
he
have
the
head
on
toast
if
you
say
a
word
beetle
till
i
give
you
leave
i
swear
i
slay
you
capitem
crinibus
i
got
him
by
the
short
hairs
now
look
as
if
nothing
had
there
was
no
need
of
guile
the
school
was
too
busy
cheering
the
drawn
match
it
hung
round
the
lavatories
regardless
of
muddy
boots
while
the
team
washed
it
cheered
crandall
minor
whenever
it
caught
sight
of
him
and
it
cheered
more
wildly
than
ever
after
prayers
because
the
old
boys
in
evening
dress
openly
twirling
their
mustaches
attended
and
instead
of
standing
with
the
masters
ranged
themselves
along
the
wall
immediately
before
the
prefects
and
the
head
called
them
over
too
majors
minors
and
tertiuses
after
their
old
names
yes
it
all
very
fine
he
said
to
his
guests
after
dinner
but
the
boys
are
getting
a
little
out
of
hand
there
will
be
trouble
and
sorrow
later
i
afraid
you
better
turn
in
early
crandall
the
dormitory
will
be
sitting
up
for
you
i
do
know
to
what
dizzy
heights
you
may
climb
in
your
profession
but
i
do
know
you
never
get
such
absolute
adoration
as
you
getting
confound
the
adoration
i
want
to
finish
my
cigar
it
all
pure
gold
go
where
glory
waits
crandall
the
setting
of
that
apotheosis
was
a
attic
dormitory
communicating
through
doorless
openings
with
three
others
the
gas
flickered
over
the
raw
pine
washstands
there
was
an
incessant
whistling
of
drafts
and
outside
the
naked
windows
the
sea
beat
on
the
pebbleridge
same
old
bed
same
old
mattress
i
believe
said
crandall
yawning
same
old
everything
oh
but
i
lame
i
no
notion
you
chaps
could
play
like
he
caressed
a
battered
shin
you
given
us
all
something
to
remember
you
it
needed
a
few
minutes
to
put
them
at
their
ease
and
in
some
way
they
could
not
understand
they
were
more
easy
when
crandall
turned
round
and
said
his
prayers
a
ceremony
he
had
neglected
for
some
years
oh
i
sorry
i
forgotten
to
put
out
the
please
do
bother
said
the
prefect
of
the
dormitory
worthington
does
a
nightgowned
who
had
been
waiting
to
show
off
leaped
from
his
bed
to
the
bracket
and
back
again
by
way
of
a
washstand
how
manage
when
he
asleep
said
crandall
chuckling
shove
a
cold
cleek
down
his
it
was
a
wet
sponge
when
i
was
junior
in
the
dormitory
hullo
happening
the
darkness
had
filled
with
whispers
the
sound
of
trailing
rugs
bare
feet
on
bare
boards
protests
giggles
and
threats
such
as
be
quiet
you
ass
on
the
floor
then
i
swear
you
are
going
to
sit
on
bed
mind
the
etc
sta
corkran
said
the
prefect
began
his
tone
showing
his
sense
of
stalky
insolence
that
perhaps
you
tell
us
about
that
business
with
duncan
yes
yes
yes
ran
the
keen
whispers
tell
us
there
nothing
to
tell
what
on
earth
are
you
chaps
hoppin
about
in
the
cold
for
never
mind
us
said
the
voices
tell
about
so
crandall
turned
on
his
pillow
and
spoke
to
the
generation
he
could
not
see
well
about
three
months
ago
he
was
commanding
a
a
cart
full
of
rupees
to
pay
troops
with
five
thousand
rupees
in
silver
he
was
comin
to
a
place
called
fort
pearson
near
i
was
born
there
squeaked
a
small
fag
it
was
called
after
my
shut
up
you
and
your
uncle
never
mind
him
well
mind
the
afridis
found
out
that
this
treasure
was
on
the
move
and
they
ambushed
the
whole
show
a
couple
of
miles
before
he
got
to
the
fort
and
cut
up
the
escort
duncan
was
wounded
and
the
escort
hooked
it
there
were
more
than
twenty
sepoys
all
told
and
there
were
any
amount
of
afridis
as
things
turned
out
i
was
in
charge
at
fort
pearson
fact
was
i
heard
the
firing
and
was
just
going
to
see
about
it
when
duncan
men
came
up
so
we
all
turned
back
together
they
told
me
something
about
an
officer
but
i
could
get
the
hang
of
things
till
i
saw
a
chap
under
the
wheels
of
the
cart
out
in
the
open
propped
up
on
one
arm
blazing
away
with
a
revolver
you
see
the
escort
had
abandoned
the
cart
and
the
afridis
they
an
awfully
suspicious
gang
thought
the
retreat
was
a
trap
sort
of
draw
you
know
and
the
cart
was
the
bait
so
they
had
left
poor
old
duncan
alone
they
spotted
how
few
we
were
it
was
a
race
across
the
flat
who
should
reach
old
duncan
first
we
ran
and
they
ran
and
we
won
and
after
a
little
hackin
about
they
pulled
off
i
never
knew
it
was
one
of
us
till
i
was
right
on
top
of
him
there
are
heaps
of
duncans
in
the
service
and
of
course
the
name
did
remind
me
he
was
changed
at
all
hardly
been
shot
through
the
lungs
poor
old
man
and
he
was
pretty
thirsty
i
gave
him
a
drink
and
sat
down
beside
him
and
funny
thing
too
he
said
toffee
and
i
said
hope
you
hurt
or
something
of
the
kind
but
he
died
in
a
minute
or
two
never
lifted
his
head
off
my
knees
i
say
you
chaps
out
there
will
get
your
death
of
cold
better
go
to
all
right
in
a
minute
but
your
cuts
your
cuts
how
did
you
get
wounded
that
was
when
we
were
taking
the
body
back
to
the
fort
they
came
on
again
and
there
was
a
bit
of
a
did
you
kill
any
one
yes
should
wonder
thank
you
crandall
thanks
crandall
the
unseen
crowds
withdrew
his
own
dormitory
rustled
into
bed
and
lay
silent
for
a
while
i
say
crandall
stalky
voice
was
tuned
to
a
wholly
foreign
reverence
well
what
suppose
a
chap
found
another
chap
croaking
with
diphtheria
all
bunged
up
with
it
and
they
stuck
a
tube
in
his
throat
and
the
chap
sucked
the
stuff
out
what
would
you
say
um
said
crandall
reflectively
i
only
heard
of
one
case
and
that
was
a
doctor
he
did
it
for
a
oh
this
was
a
woman
it
was
just
a
makes
it
all
the
finer
then
it
about
the
bravest
thing
a
man
can
do
why
oh
i
heard
of
a
chap
doin
it
that
then
he
a
brave
would
funk
it
anybody
would
fancy
dying
of
diphtheria
in
cold
well
ah
er
look
here
the
sentence
ended
in
a
grunt
for
stalky
had
leaped
out
of
bed
and
with
mcturk
was
sitting
on
the
head
of
beetle
who
would
have
sprung
the
mine
there
and
then
next
day
which
was
the
last
of
the
term
and
given
up
to
a
few
wholly
unimportant
examinations
began
with
wrath
and
war
king
had
discovered
that
nearly
all
his
house
it
lay
as
you
know
next
door
but
one
to
prout
in
the
long
range
of
buildings
had
unlocked
the
doors
between
the
dormitories
and
had
gone
in
to
listen
to
a
story
told
by
crandall
he
went
to
the
head
clamorous
injured
appealing
for
he
never
approved
of
allowing
young
men
of
the
world
to
contaminate
the
morals
of
boyhood
very
good
said
the
head
he
would
attend
to
it
well
i
sorry
said
crandall
guiltily
i
do
think
i
told
anything
they
ought
to
hear
do
let
them
get
into
trouble
on
my
tck
the
head
answered
with
the
ghost
of
a
wink
it
is
the
boys
that
make
trouble
it
the
masters
however
prout
and
king
approve
of
dormitory
gatherings
on
this
scale
and
one
must
back
up
the
moreover
it
hopeless
to
punish
two
houses
only
so
late
in
the
term
we
must
be
fair
and
include
everybody
let
see
they
have
a
holiday
task
for
the
easters
which
of
course
none
of
them
will
ever
look
at
we
will
give
the
whole
school
except
prefects
and
regular
prep
and
the
will
have
to
supply
a
master
to
take
it
we
must
be
fair
to
prep
on
the
last
night
of
the
term
whew
said
crandall
thinking
of
his
own
wild
youth
i
fancy
there
will
be
the
school
frolicking
among
packed
trunks
whooping
down
the
corridor
and
gloating
in
received
the
news
with
amazement
and
rage
no
school
in
the
world
did
prep
on
the
last
night
of
the
term
this
thing
was
monstrous
tyrannical
subversive
of
law
religion
and
morality
they
would
go
into
the
and
they
would
take
their
degraded
holiday
task
with
them
but
here
they
smiled
and
speculated
what
manner
of
man
the
would
send
up
against
them
the
lot
fell
on
mason
credulous
and
enthusiastic
who
loved
youth
no
other
master
was
anxious
to
take
that
for
the
school
lacked
the
steadying
influence
of
tradition
and
men
accustomed
to
the
ordered
routine
of
ancient
foundations
found
it
occasionally
insubordinate
the
four
long
in
which
all
below
the
rank
of
worked
received
him
with
thunders
of
applause
ere
he
had
coughed
twice
they
favored
him
with
a
metrical
summary
of
the
marriage
laws
of
great
britain
as
recorded
by
the
high
priest
of
the
israelites
and
commented
on
by
the
leader
of
the
host
the
lower
forms
reminded
him
that
it
was
the
last
day
and
that
therefore
he
must
take
it
all
in
when
he
dashed
off
to
rebuke
them
the
lower
fourth
and
upper
third
began
with
one
accord
to
be
sick
loudly
and
realistically
mason
tried
of
all
vain
things
under
heaven
to
argue
with
them
and
a
bold
soul
at
a
back
desk
bade
him
take
fifty
lines
for
not
up
before
as
one
who
prided
himself
upon
the
perfection
of
his
english
this
cut
mason
to
the
quick
and
while
he
was
trying
to
discover
the
offender
the
upper
and
lower
second
three
away
turned
out
the
gas
and
threw
it
was
a
pleasant
and
stimulating
the
and
prefects
heard
the
echoes
of
it
far
off
and
the
at
dessert
smiled
stalky
waited
watch
in
hand
till
eight
if
it
goes
on
much
longer
the
head
will
come
up
said
he
we
tell
the
studies
first
and
then
the
look
sharp
he
allowed
no
time
for
beetle
to
be
dramatic
or
mcturk
to
drawl
they
poured
into
study
after
study
told
their
tale
and
went
again
so
soon
as
they
saw
they
were
understood
waiting
for
no
comment
while
the
noise
of
that
unholy
grew
and
deepened
by
the
door
of
study
they
met
mason
flying
towards
the
he
gone
to
fetch
the
head
hurry
up
come
on
they
broke
into
number
twelve
abreast
and
panting
the
head
the
head
the
head
that
call
stilled
the
tumult
for
a
minute
and
stalky
leaping
to
a
desk
shouted
he
went
and
sucked
the
diphtheria
stuff
out
of
stettson
major
throat
when
we
thought
he
was
in
town
stop
rotting
you
asses
stettson
major
would
have
croaked
if
the
head
had
done
it
the
head
might
have
died
himself
crandall
says
it
the
bravest
thing
any
livin
man
can
do
and
i
his
voice
cracked
the
head
do
know
we
know
mcturk
and
beetle
jumping
from
desk
to
desk
drove
the
news
home
among
the
junior
forms
there
was
a
pause
and
then
mason
behind
him
the
head
entered
it
was
in
the
established
order
of
things
that
no
boy
should
speak
or
move
under
his
eye
he
expected
the
hush
of
awe
he
was
received
with
cheers
steady
ceaseless
cheering
being
a
wise
man
he
went
away
and
the
forms
were
silent
and
a
little
frightened
it
all
right
said
stalky
he
ca
do
much
is
as
if
pulled
the
desks
up
like
we
did
when
old
carleton
took
prep
once
keep
it
up
hear
cheering
in
the
studies
he
rocketed
out
with
a
yell
to
find
flint
and
the
prefects
lifting
the
roof
off
the
corridor
when
the
head
of
a
limited
liability
company
paying
four
per
is
cheered
on
his
saintly
way
to
prayers
not
only
by
four
of
boys
waiting
punishment
but
by
his
trusted
prefects
he
can
either
ask
for
an
explanation
or
go
his
road
with
dignity
while
the
senior
glares
like
an
excited
cat
and
points
out
to
a
white
and
trembling
mathematical
master
that
certain
methods
not
his
thank
god
produce
certain
results
out
of
delicacy
the
old
boys
did
not
attend
that
and
it
was
to
the
school
drawn
up
in
the
gymnasium
that
the
head
spoke
icily
it
is
not
often
that
i
do
not
understand
you
but
i
confess
i
do
not
some
of
you
after
your
idiotic
performances
at
seem
to
think
me
a
fit
person
to
cheer
i
am
going
to
show
you
that
i
am
crash
crash
crash
came
the
triple
cheer
that
disproved
it
and
the
head
glowered
under
the
gas
that
is
enough
you
will
gain
nothing
the
little
boys
the
lower
school
did
not
like
that
form
of
address
will
do
me
three
hundred
lines
apiece
in
the
holidays
i
shall
take
no
further
notice
of
them
the
upper
school
will
do
me
one
thousand
lines
apiece
in
the
holidays
to
be
shown
up
the
evening
of
the
day
they
come
back
and
further
gummy
what
a
glutton
stalky
whispered
for
your
behavior
towards
mason
i
intend
to
lick
the
whole
of
the
upper
school
when
i
give
you
your
this
will
include
the
three
i
found
dancing
on
the
desks
when
i
came
up
prefects
will
stay
after
the
school
filed
out
in
silence
but
gathered
in
groups
by
the
gymnasium
door
waiting
what
might
befall
and
now
flint
said
the
head
will
you
be
good
enough
to
give
me
some
explanation
of
your
conduct
well
sir
said
flint
desperately
if
you
save
a
chap
life
at
the
risk
of
your
own
when
he
dyin
of
diphtheria
and
the
coll
finds
it
out
can
you
expect
sir
um
i
see
then
that
noise
was
not
meant
for
ah
cheek
i
can
connive
at
immorality
but
i
can
not
stand
impudence
however
it
does
not
excuse
their
insolence
to
mason
i
forego
the
lines
this
once
remember
but
the
lickings
hold
when
this
news
was
made
public
the
school
lost
in
wonder
and
admiration
gasped
at
the
head
as
he
went
to
his
house
here
was
a
man
to
be
reverenced
on
the
rare
occasions
when
he
caned
he
did
it
very
scientifically
and
the
execution
of
a
hundred
boys
would
be
epic
immense
it
all
right
head
sahib
know
said
crandall
as
the
head
slipped
off
his
gown
with
a
grunt
in
his
i
found
out
just
now
from
our
substitute
he
was
gettin
my
opinion
of
your
performance
last
night
in
the
dormitory
i
did
know
then
that
it
was
you
he
was
talkin
about
crafty
young
animal
freckled
chap
with
eyes
i
think
his
name
oh
i
know
thank
you
said
the
head
and
reflectively
i
should
have
included
them
even
if
i
had
seen
if
the
old
coll
were
a
little
above
themselves
already
we
chair
you
down
the
corridor
said
the
engineer
oh

how
could
you
you

have
caught
it
yourself
and
where
would
we
have
been
then
i
always
knew
you
were
worth
twenty
of
us
any
day
now
i
sure
of
it
said
the
squadron
commander
looking
round
for
contradictions
he
is
fit
to
manage
a
school
though
promise
you
never
do
it
again
bates
sahib
we
we
ca
go
away
comfy
in
our
minds
if
you

these
risks
said
the
gunner
bates
sahib
you
are
ever
goin
to
cane
the
whole
upper
school
are
you
said
crandall
i
can
connive
at
immorality
as
i
said
but
i
ca
stand
impudence
mason
lot
is
quite
hard
enough
even
when
i
back
him
besides
the
men
at
the
heard
them
singing
and
moses
i
shall
have
complaints
about
that
from
the
parents
of
decency
must
be
we
coming
to
help
said
all
the
guests
the
upper
school
were
caned
one
after
the
other
their
overcoats
over
their
arms
the
brakes
waiting
in
the
road
below
to
take
them
to
the
station
their
on
the
table
the
head
began
with
stalky
mcturk
and
beetle
he
dealt
faithfully
by
them
and
here
your
and
pleasant
thank
you
sir
they
shook
hands
desire
do
outrun
performance
much
this
mornin
we
got
the
cream
of
it
said
stalky
now
wait
till
a
few
chaps
come
out
and
we
really
cheer
do
wait
on
our
account
please
said
crandall
speaking
for
the
old
boys
we
going
to
begin
it
was
very
well
so
long
as
the
cheering
was
confined
to
the
corridor
but
when
it
spread
to
the
gymnasium
when
the
boys
awaiting
their
turn
cheered
the
head
gave
it
up
in
despair
and
the
remnant
flung
themselves
upon
him
to
shake
hands
then
they
seriously
devoted
themselves
to
cheering
till
the
brakes
were
hustled
off
the
premises
in
did
i
say
i
get
even
with
him
said
stalky
on
the
as
they
swung
into
the
narrow
northam
street
now
all
together
time
from
your
uncle
stalky
it
a
way
we
have
in
the
army
it
a
way
we
have
in
the
navy
it
a
way
we
have
at
the
public
schools
which
nobody
can
deny
the
flag
of
their
country
it
was
winter
and
bitter
cold
of
mornings
consequently
stalky
and
beetle
mcturk
being
of
the
offensive
type
that
makes
ornate
toilet
under
all
circumstances
drowsed
till
the
last
moment
before
turning
out
to
in
the
gymnasium
it
followed
that
they
were
often
late
and
since
every
unpunctuality
earned
them
a
black
mark
and
since
three
black
marks
a
week
meant
defaulters
drill
equally
it
followed
that
they
spent
hours
under
the
sergeant
hand
foxy
drilled
the
defaulters
with
all
the
pomp
of
his
old
do
think
any
pleasure

so
easy
as

bob
i
can

as
well
as

we

to
imagine
you

defaulters
at
all
but
an
company
on
parade
me
bein
your
commandin
officer
no
call
to
laugh
if

of

me
a
little
credit
you
been
at
it
long
enough
goodness
they
were
formed
into
fours
marched
wheeled
and
countermarched
the
spell
of
ordered
motion
strong
on
them
as
foxy
said
they
had
been
at
it
a
long
time
the
gymnasium
door
opened
revealing
mcturk
in
charge
of
an
old
gentleman
the
sergeant
leading
a
wheel
did
not
see
not
so
bad
he
murmured
not
so
bad
the
of
the
wheel
marks
time
muster
swayne
now
muster
corkran
you
say
you

the
drill
oblige
me
by
takin
over
the
command
and
reversin
my
words
step
by
step
relegate
them
to
their
previous
what
this
what
this
cried
the
visitor
authoritatively
a
a
little
drill
sir
stammered
foxy
saying
nothing
of
first
causes
excellent
excellent
i
only
wish
there
were
more
of
it
he
chirruped
do
let
me
interrupt
you
were
just
going
to
hand
over
to
someone
were
you
he
sat
down
breathing
frostily
in
the
chill
air
i
shall
muck
it
i
know
i
shall
whispered
stalky
uneasily
and
his
discomfort
was
not
lightened
by
a
murmur
from
the
rear
rank
that
the
old
gentleman
was
general
collinson
a
member
of
the
college
board
of
council
eh
what
said
foxy
collinson
he
commanded
the
pompadours
my
father
old
regiment
hissed
swayne
major
take
your
time
said
the
visitor
know
how
it
feels
your
first
drill
eh
yes
he
drew
an
unhappy
breath
dress
the
echo
of
his
own
voice
restored
his
confidence
the
wheel
was
faced
about
flung
back
broken
into
fours
and
restored
to
line
without
a
falter
the
official
hour
of
punishment
was
long
passed
but
no
one
thought
of
that
they
were
backing
up
stalky
stalky
in
deadly
fear
lest
his
voice
should
crack
he
does
you
credit
sergeant
was
the
visitor
comment
a
good
drill
and
good
material
to
drill
now
it
an
extraordinary
thing
i
been
lunching
with
your
and
he
never
told
me
you
had
a
in
the
we
sir
this
is
only
a
little
drill
said
the
sergeant
but
are
they
keen
on
it
said
mcturk
speaking
for
the
first
time
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
why
are
you
in
it
though
willy
oh
i
not
punctual
enough
said
mcturk
the
sergeant
only
takes
the
pick
of
dismiss
break
off
cried
foxy
fearing
an
explosion
in
the
ranks
i
i
ought
to
have
told
you
sir
that
but
you
should
have
a
the
general
pursued
his
own
line
of
thought
you
have
a
too
if
my
recommendation
in
council
is
any
use
i
do
know
when
i
been
so
pleased
boys
animated
by
a
spirit
like
yours
should
set
an
example
to
the
whole
they
do
said
mcturk
bless
my
soul
can
it
be
so
late
i
kept
my
fly
waiting
half
an
hour
well
i
must
run
away
nothing
like
seeing
things
for
one
self
which
end
of
the
buildings
does
one
get
out
at
will
you
show
me
willy
who
was
that
boy
who
took
the
drill
corkran
i
think
his
name
you
ought
to
know
him
that
the
kind
of
boy
you
should
cultivate
evidently
an
unusual
sort
a
wonderful
sight
five
and
twenty
boys
who
i
dare
say
would
much
sooner
be
playing
cricket
it
was
the
depth
of
winter
but
grown
people
especially
those
who
have
lived
long
in
foreign
parts
make
these
little
errors
and
mcturk
did
not
correct
him
drilling
for
the
sheer
love
of
it
a
shame
to
waste
so
much
good
stuff
but
i
think
i
can
carry
my
an
who
your
friend
with
the
white
whiskers
demanded
stalky
on
mcturk
return
to
the
study
general
collinson
he
comes
over
to
shoot
with
my
father
sometimes
rather
a
decent
old
bargee
too
he
said
i
ought
to
cultivate
your
acquaintance
did
he
tip
you
mcturk
exhibited
a
blessed
whole
sovereign
ah
said
stalky
annexing
it
for
he
was
treasurer
we
have
a
hefty
brew
you
pretty
average
cool
cheek
turkey
to
jaw
about
our
keenness
an
did
the
old
boy
know
we
were
defaulters
said
beetle
not
him
he
came
down
to
lunch
with
the
head
i
found
him
pokin
about
the
place
on
his
own
hook
afterwards
an
i
thought
i
show
him
the
giddy
drill
when
i
found
he
was
so
pleased
i
was
goin
to
damp
his
giddy
ardor
he
might
ha
given
me
the
quid
if
i
was
old
foxy
pleased
did
you
see
him
get
pink
behind
the
ears
said
beetle
it
was
an
awful
score
for
him
did
we
back
him
up
beautifully
let
go
down
to
keyte
and
get
some
cocoa
and
they
overtook
foxy
speeding
down
to
retail
the
adventure
to
keyte
who
in
his
time
had
been
troop
in
a
cavalry
regiment
and
now
veteran
was
local
postmaster
and
confectioner
you
owe
us
something
said
stalky
with
meaning
i
grateful
muster
corkran
i
to
run
against
you
pretty
hard
in
the
way
o
business
now
and
then
but
i
will
say
that
outside
o
business
bounds
an
smokin
an
such
like
i
do
wish
to
have
a
more
trustworthy
young
gentleman
to
me
out
of
a
hole
the
way
you
the
drill
was
beautiful
though
i
say
it
now
if
you
come
regular
henceforward
but
he
have
to
be
late
three
times
a
week
said
beetle
you
expect
a
chap
to
do
that
just
to
please
you
ah
that
true
still
if
you
could
manage
it
and
you
muster
beetle
it
would
give
you
a
big
start
when
the
is
formed
i
expect
the
general
will
recommend
they
raided
keyte
very
much
at
their
own
sweet
will
for
the
old
man
who
knew
them
well
was
deep
in
talk
with
foxy
i
make
what
taken
seven
and
six
stalky
called
at
last
over
the
counter
but
better
count
for
no
no
i
take
your
word
any
day
muster
in
the
pompadours
was
he
sergeant
we
lay
with
them
once
at
umballa
i
think
it
i
do
know
whether
this
tin
is
eighteen
pence
or
one
an
say
one
an
fourpence
muster
corkran
of
course
sergeant
if
it
was
any
use
to
give
my
time
i
be
pleased
to
do
it
but
i
too
old
like
to
see
a
drill
oh
come
on
stalky
cried
mcturk
he
is
listenin
to
you
chuck
over
the
i
want
the
quid
changed
you
ass
keyte
private
keyte
corporal
keyte
keyte
will
you
give
me
change
for
a
quid
yes
yes
of
course
seven
an
he
stared
abstractedly
pushed
the
silver
over
and
melted
away
into
the
darkness
of
the
back
room
now
those
two
jaw
about
the
mutiny
till
said
beetle
old
keyte
was
at
sobraon
said
stalky
hear
him
talk
about
that
sometimes
beats
foxy
the
head
face
inscrutable
as
ever
was
bent
over
a
pile
of
letters
what
do
you
think
he
said
at
last
to
the
reverend
john
gillett
it
a
good
idea
there
no
denying
that
an
estimable
we
concede
that
much
well
i
have
my
doubts
about
it
that
all
the
more
i
know
of
boys
the
less
do
i
profess
myself
capable
of
following
their
moods
but
i
own
i
shall
be
very
much
surprised
if
the
scheme
takes
it
it
is
the
temper
of
the
school
we
prepare
for
the
my
business
in
matter
is
to
carry
out
the
wishes
of
the
council
they
demand
a
volunteer
a
volunteer
will
be
furnished
i
have
suggested
however
that
we
need
not
embark
upon
the
expense
of
uniforms
till
we
are
drilled
general
collinson
is
sending
us
fifty
lethal
weapons
sniders
he
calls
them
all
carefully
yes
that
is
necessary
in
a
school
that
uses
loaded
to
the
extent
we
the
reverend
john
smiled
therefore
there
will
be
no
outlay
except
the
sergeant
but
if
he
fails
you
will
be
oh
assuredly
i
shall
post
a
notice
in
the
corridor
this
afternoon
and
i
shall
watch
the
kindly
keep
your

new

the

of
those
years
and
could
be
trusted
for
general

uneasily
knowing
that
many
waited
on
their

a
pained
tone

beetle
joined
in
they
had
found
the
poem
in
an
old
volume
of
punch
and
it
seemed
to
cover
the
situation
an
both
of
led
to
adversity
which
nobody
can
deny
you
be
quiet
young
gentlemen
if
you
ca
do
eye
was
still
on
the
council
by
the
horse
carter
white
and
tyrrell
all
boys
of
influence
had
joined
it
the
rest
fingered
the
rifles
irresolutely
wait
a
shake
cried
stalky
ca
we
turn
out
those
rotters
before
we
get
to
work
certainly
said
foxy
any
one
wishful
to
join
will
stay
those
who
do
not
so
intend
will
go
out
quietly
closin
the
door
half
a
dozen
of
the
rushed
at
them
and
they
had
just
time
to
escape
into
the
corridor
well
why
do
you
join
beetle
asked
resettling
his
collar
why
did
you
what
the
good
we
are
goin
up
for
the
army
besides
i
know
the
drill
all
except
the
manual
of
course
what
they
inside
makin
a
treaty
with
foxy
did
you
hear
stalky
say
what
we
do
an
if
he
do
like
it
he
can
lump
it
they
use
foxy
for
a
cram
ca
you
see
you
idiot
they
goin
up
for
sandhurst
or
the
shop
in
less
than
a
year
they
learn
their
drill
an
then
drop
it
like
a
shot
suppose
chaps
with
their
amount
of
are
takin
up
volunteerin
for
fun
well
i
do
know
i
thought
of
doin
a
poem
about
it
rottin
you
know
ballad
of
the
dogshooters
eh
i
do
think
you
can
because
king
be
down
on
the
corps
like
a
cartload
o
bricks
he
has
been
consulted
he
sniffin
round
the
now
let
lure
they
strolled
up
carelessly
towards
the
a
most
meek
couple
how
this
said
king
with
a
start
of
feigned
surprise
methought
you
would
be
learning
to
fight
for
your
i
think
the
company
full
sir
said
mcturk
it
a
great
pity
sighed
beetle
forty
valiant
defenders
have
we
then
how
noble
what
devotion
i
presume
that
it
is
possible
that
a
desire
to
evade
their
normal
responsibilities
may
be
at
the
bottom
of
this
zeal
doubtless
they
will
be
accorded
special
privileges
like
the
choir
and
the
natural
history
society
one
must
not
say
oh
i
suppose
so
sir
said
mcturk
cheerily
the
head
has
said
anything
about
it
yet
but
he
will
of
oh
sure
it
is
just
possible
my
beetle
king
wheeled
on
the
last
speaker
that
the
a
necessary
but
somewhat
neglected
factor
in
our
humble
scheme
of
existence
may
have
a
word
to
say
on
the
matter
life
for
the
young
at
least
is
not
all
weapons
and
munitions
of
war
education
is
incidentally
one
of
our
what
a
consistent
pig
he
is
cooed
mcturk
when
they
were
out
of
earshot
one
always
knows
where
to
have
him
did
you
see
how
he
rose
to
that
draw
about
the
head
and
special
privileges
confound
him
he
might
have
had
the
decency
to
have
backed
the
scheme
i
could
do
such
a
lovely
ballad
rottin
it
and
now
i
have
to
be
a
giddy
enthusiast
it
do
bar
our
pulling
stalky
leg
in
the
study
does
it
oh
no
but
in
the
coll
we
must
be
like
anything
ca
you
make
up
a
giddy
epigram
la
about
king
objectin
to
it
beetle
was
at
this
noble
task
when
stalky
returned
all
hot
from
his
first
drill
hullo
my
began
mcturk
where
your
dead
dog
is
it
defence
or
defiance
defiance
said
stalky
and
leaped
on
him
at
that
word
look
here
turkey
you
must
rot
the
corps
we
arranged
it
beautifully
foxy
swears
he
wo
take
us
out
into
the
open
till
we
say
we
want
to
exhibition
of
immature
infants
apin
the
idiosyncrasies
of
their
elders
snff
have
you
drawn
king
beetle
stalky
asked
in
a
pause
of
the
scuffle
not
exactly
but
that
his
genial
well
listen
to
your
uncle
stalky
who
is
a
great
man
moreover
and
subsequently
foxy
goin
to
let
us
drill
the
corps
in
turn
et
so
that
we
all
know
how
to
handle
a
half
company
anyhow
an
when
we
go
to
the
shop
we
shall
be
dismissed
drill
early
thus
my
beloved
education
with
wholesome
i
knew
you
make
a
sort
of
of
it
you
brute
said
mcturk
do
you
want
to
die
for
your
giddy
country
not
if
i
can
jolly
well
avoid
it
so
you
must
rot
the
we
decided
on
that
years
ago
said
beetle
scornfully
king
do
the
then
you
got
to
rot
king
my
giddy
poet
make
up
a
good
catchy
limerick
and
let
the
fags
sing
look
here
you
stick
to
volunteerin
and
do
jog
the
he
wo
have
anything
to
take
hold
of
said
stalky
with
dark
significance
they
did
not
know
what
that
meant
till
a
few
days
later
they
proposed
to
watch
the
corps
at
drill
they
found
the
gymnasium
door
locked
and
a
fag
on
guard
this
is
sweet
cheek
said
mcturk
stooping
must
look
through
the
said
the
sentry
i
like
that
why
wake
you
little
beast
i
made
you
a
ca
help
it
my
orders
are
not
to
allow
any
one
to
we
do
said
mcturk
we
jolly
well
slay
you
my
orders
are
i
am
to
give
the
name
of
anybody
who
interfered
with
me
on
my
post
to
the
corps
an
they
deal
with
him
after
drill
accordin
to
martial
what
a
brute
stalky
is
said
beetle
they
never
doubted
for
a
moment
who
had
devised
that
scheme
you
esteem
yourself
a
giddy
centurion
do
you
said
beetle
listening
to
the
crash
and
rattle
of
grounded
arms
within
my
orders
are
not
to
talk
except
to
explain
my
orders
they
lick
me
if
i
mcturk
looked
at
beetle
the
two
shook
their
heads
and
turned
away
i
swear
stalky
a
great
man
said
beetle
after
a
long
pause
one
consolation
is
that
this
sort
of
biznai
will
drive
king
it
troubled
many
more
than
king
but
the
members
of
the
corps
were
muter
than
oysters
foxy
being
bound
by
no
vow
carried
his
woes
to
keyte
i
never
come
across
such
nonsense
in
my
life
they
tiled
the
lodge
inner
and
outer
guard
all
complete
and
then
they
get
to
work
keen
as
but
what
it
all
for
asked
the
to
learn
their
drill
you
never
saw
anything
like
it
they
begin
after
i
dismissed
practisin
tricks
but
out
into
the
open
they
will
come
not
for
ever
so
the
thing
is
if
a
say
be
a
instead
o
hidin
locked
and
what
do
the
authorities
say
about
it
that
beats
me
the
sergeant
spoke
fretfully
i
go
to
the
an
gives
me
no
help
there
times
when
i
think
he
makin
fun
me
i
never
been
a
thank
god
but
i
always
had
the
consideration
to
pity
i
glad
o
i
like
to
see
said
keyte
from
your
statements
sergeant
i
ca
get
at
what
they
do
ask
me
major
ask
that
young
corkran
he
their
one
does
not
refuse
a
warrior
of
sobraon
or
deny
the
only
within
bounds
so
keyte
came
by
invitation
leaning
upon
a
stick
tremulous
with
old
age
to
sit
in
a
corner
and
watch
they
shape
well
they
shape
uncommon
well
he
whispered
between
evolutions
oh
this
is
what
they
after
wait
till
i
dismiss
at
the
the
ranks
stood
fast
perowne
fell
out
faced
them
and
refreshing
his
memory
by
glimpses
at
a
book
drilled
them
for
ten
minutes
this
is
that
perowne
who
was
shot
in
equatorial
africa
by
his
own
men
ansell
followed
him
and
hogan
followed
ansell
all
three
were
implicitly
obeyed
then
stalky
laid
aside
his
snider
and
drawing
a
long
breath
favored
the
company
with
a
blast
of
withering
invective
muster
corkran
that
ai
in
any
drill
cried
foxy
all
right
sergeant
you
never
know
what
you
may
have
to
say
to
your
for
pity
sake
try
to
stand
up
without
leanin
against
each
other
you
it
no
pleasure
to
me
to
comb
you
out
that
ought
to
have
been
done
before
you
came
here
you
you
militia
the
old
touch
the
old
touch
know
it
said
keyte
wiping
his
rheumy
eyes
but
where
did
he
pick
it
up
from
his
father
or
his
uncle
do
ask
me
half
of
must
have
been
born
within
earshot
o
the
foxy
was
not
far
wrong
in
his
guess
i
heard
more
since
this
volunteerin
nonsense
began
than
i
heard
in
a
year
in
the
there
a
man
lookin
as
though
his
belly
were
in
the
yes
you
private
ansell
and
stalky
the
victim
for
three
minutes
in
gross
and
in
detail
hullo
he
returned
to
his
normal
tone
first
blood
to
me
you
flushed
ansell
you
could
help
flushing
was
the
answer
do
think
i
wriggled
well
it
your
turn
stalky
resumed
his
place
in
the
ranks
lord
lord
it
as
good
as
a
play
chuckled
the
attentive
keyte
ansell
too
had
been
blessed
with
relatives
in
the
service
and
slowly
in
a
lazy
drawl
his
style
was
more
reflective
than
stalky
descended
the
abysmal
depths
of
personality
blood
to
me
he
shouted
triumphantly
you
could
stand
it
stalky
was
a
rich
red
and
his
snider
shook
visibly
i
did
think
i
would
he
said
struggling
for
composure
but
after
a
bit
i
got
in
no
end
of
a
bait
curious
ai
it
good
for
the
temper
said
the
hogan
as
they
returned
arms
to
the
rack
did
you
ever
said
foxy
hopelessly
to
keyte
i
do
know
much
about
volunteers
but
it
the
rummiest
show
i
ever
saw
i
can
see
what
they
gettin
at
though
lord
how
often
been
told
off
an
dressed
down
in
my
day
they
shape
well
extremely
well
they
if
i
could
get
out
into
the
open
there
nothing
i
could
do
with
major
perhaps
when
the
uniforms
come
down
they
change
their
indeed
it
was
time
that
the
corps
made
some
concession
to
the
curiosity
of
the
school
thrice
had
the
guard
been
maltreated
and
thrice
had
the
corps
dealt
out
martial
law
to
the
offender
the
school
raged
what
was
the
use
they
asked
of
a
which
none
might
see
king
congratulated
them
on
their
invisible
defenders
and
they
could
not
parry
his
thrusts
foxy
was
growing
sullen
and
restive
a
few
of
the
corps
expressed
openly
doubts
as
to
the
wisdom
of
their
course
and
the
question
of
uniforms
loomed
on
the
near
horizon
if
these
were
issued
they
would
be
forced
to
wear
them
but
as
so
often
happens
in
this
life
the
matter
was
suddenly
settled
from
without
the
head
had
duly
informed
the
council
that
their
recommendation
had
been
acted
upon
and
that
so
far
as
he
could
learn
the
boys
were
drilling
he
said
nothing
of
the
terms
on
which
they
drilled
naturally
general
collinson
was
delighted
and
told
his
friends
one
of
his
friends
rejoiced
in
a
friend
a
member
of
parliament
a
zealous
an
intelligent
and
above
all
a
patriotic
person
anxious
to
do
the
most
good
in
the
shortest
possible
time
but
we
can
not
answer
alas
for
the
friends
of
our
friends
if
collinson
friend
had
introduced
him
to
the
general
the
latter
would
have
taken
his
measure
and
saved
much
but
the
friend
merely
spoke
of
his
friend
and
since
no
two
people
in
the
world
see
eye
to
eye
the
picture
conveyed
to
collinson
was
inaccurate
moreover
the
man
was
an
an
impeccable
conservative
and
the
general
had
the
english
soldier
lurking
respect
for
any
member
of
the
court
of
last
appeal
he
was
going
down
into
the
west
country
to
spread
light
in
somebody
benighted
constituency
would
it
be
a
good
idea
if
armed
with
the
general
recommendation
he
taking
the
admirable
and
newly
established
for
his
text
spoke
a
few
words
just
talked
to
the
boys
a
little
eh
you
know
the
kind
of
thing
that
would
be
acceptable
and
he
be
the
very
man
to
do
it
the
sort
of
talk
that
boys
understand
you
they
did
talk
to
much
in
my
time
said
the
general
suspiciously
ah
but
times
change
with
the
spread
of
education
and
so
on
the
boys
of
are
the
men
of
an
impression
in
youth
is
likely
to
be
permanent
and
in
these
times
you
know
with
the
country
going
to
the
dogs
you
quite
the
island
was
then
entering
on
five
years
of
gladstone
rule
and
the
general
did
not
like
what
he
had
seen
of
it
he
would
certainly
write
to
the
head
for
it
was
beyond
question
that
the
boys
of
made
the
men
of
that
if
he
might
say
so
was
uncommonly
well
put
in
reply
the
head
stated
that
he
should
be
delighted
to
welcome
raymond
martin
of
whom
he
had
heard
so
much
to
put
him
up
for
the
night
and
to
allow
him
to
address
the
school
on
any
subject
that
he
conceived
would
interest
them
if
martin
had
not
yet
faced
an
audience
of
this
particular
class
of
british
youth
the
head
had
no
doubt
that
he
would
find
it
an
interesting
experience
and
i
do
think
i
am
very
far
wrong
in
that
last
he
confided
to
the
reverend
john
do
you
happen
to
know
anything
of
one
raymond
martin
i
was
at
college
with
a
man
of
that
name
the
chaplain
replied
he
was
without
form
and
void
so
far
as
i
remember
but
desperately
he
will
address
the
coll
on
next
if
there
is
one
thing
our
boys
detest
more
than
another
it
is
having
their
saturday
evenings
broken
into
patriotism
has
no
chance
beside
nor
art
either
remember
our
with
shakespeare
the
head
eyes
twinkled
or
the
humorous
gentleman
with
the
magic
lantern
an
who
the
dooce
is
this
raymond
martin
demanded
beetle
when
he
read
the
notice
of
the
lecture
in
the
corridor
why
do
the
brutes
always
turn
up
on
a
saturday
ouh
reomeo
reomeo
wherefore
art
thou
reomeo
said
mcturk
over
his
shoulder
quoting
the
shakespeare
artiste
of
last
term
well
he
be
as
bad
as
i
hope
stalky
are
you
properly
patriotic
because
if
you
ai
this
chap
goin
to
make
hope
he
wo
take
up
the
whole
of
the
evening
i
suppose
we
got
to
listen
to
would
miss
him
for
the
world
said
mcturk
a
lot
of
chaps
thought
that
woman
was
a
bore
did
i
liked
her
when
she
began
to
hiccough
in
the
middle
of
it
he
hiccough
whoever
gets
into
the
gym
first
bags
seats
for
the
other
there
was
no
nervousness
but
a
brisk
and
cheery
affability
about
raymond
martin
as
he
drove
up
watched
by
many
eyes
to
the
head
house
looks
a
bit
of
a
bargee
was
mcturk
comment
should
be
surprised
if
he
was
a
radical
he
rowed
the
driver
about
the
fare
i
heard
that
was
his
giddy
patriotism
beetle
explained
after
tea
they
joined
the
rush
for
seats
secured
a
private
and
invisible
corner
and
began
to
criticise
every

lit
on
the
little
dais
at
the
far
end

the
head
official
desk
whence
martin
would
discourse
and
a
ring
of
chairs
for
the
masters
entered
then
foxy
with
official
port
and
leaned
something
like
a
cloth
rolled
round
a
stick
against
the
desk
no
one
in
authority
was
yet
present
so
the
school
applauded
crying
what
that
foxy
what
are
you
stealin
the
gentleman
brolly
for
we
do
birch
here
we
cane
take
away
that
bauble
number
off
from
the
right
and
so
forth
till
the
entry
of
the
head
and
the
masters
ended
all
demonstrations
one
good
job
the
hate
this
as
much
as
we
do
watch
king
wrigglin
to
get
out
of
the
where
the
raymondiferous
martin
punctuality
my
beloved
is
the
image
o
war
shut
up
here
the
giddy
dook
golly
what
a
dewlap
martin
in
evening
dress
was
undeniably
throaty
a
tall
generously
designed
man
still
beetle
need
not
have
been
coarse
look
at
his
back
while
he
talkin
to
the
head
vile
bad
form
to
turn
your
back
on
the
audience
he
a
philistine
a
bopper
a
jebusite
a
mcturk
leaned
back
and
sniffed
contemptuously
in
a
few
colorless
words
the
head
introduced
the
speaker
and
sat
down
amid
applause
when
martin
took
the
applause
to
himself
they
naturally
applauded
more
than
ever
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
begin
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
school
its
tradition
or
heritage
he
did
not
know
that
the
last
census
showed
that
eighty
per
cent
of
the
boys
had
been
born
abroad
in
camp
cantonment
or
upon
the
high
seas
or
that
per
cent
were
sons
of
officers
in
one
or
other
of
the
services
willoughbys
paulets
de
castros
maynes
randalls
after
their
kind
looking
to
follow
their
fathers
profession
the
head
might
have
told
him
this
and
much
more
but
after
an
dinner
in
his
company
the
head
decided
to
say
nothing
whatever
raymond
martin
seemed
to
know
so
much
already
he
plunged
into
his
speech
with
a
rasping
well
boys
that
though
they
were
not
conscious
of
it
set
every
young
nerve
ajar
he
supposed
they
knew
hey
what
he
had
come
down
for
it
was
not
often
that
he
had
an
opportunity
to
talk
to
boys
he
supposed
that
boys
were
very
much
the
same
kind
of
persons
some
people
thought
them
rather
funny
persons
as
they
had
been
in
his
youth
this
man
said
mcturk
with
conviction
is
gadarene
but
they
must
remember
that
they
would
not
always
be
boys
they
would
grow
up
into
men
because
the
boys
of
made
the
men
of
and
upon
the
men
of
the
fair
fame
of
their
glorious
native
land
depended
if
this
goes
on
my
beloved
it
will
be
my
painful
duty
to
rot
this
stalky
drew
a
long
breath
through
his
nose
ca
do
that
said
mcturk
he
ai
chargin
anything
for
his
and
so
they
ought
to
think
of
the
duties
and
responsibilities
of
the
life
that
was
opening
before
them
life
was
not
all
he
enumerated
a
few
games
and
that
nothing
might
be
lacking
to
the
sweep
and
impact
of
his
fall
added
yes
life
was
not
he
said
all
there
was
one
tense
gasp
among
the
juniors
almost
a
shriek
of
quivering
horror
he
was
a
heathen
an
outcast
the
extremest
pale
of
toleration
before
all
men
stalky
bowed
his
head
in
his
hands
mcturk
with
a
bright
and
cheerful
eye
drank
in
every
word
and
beetle
nodded
solemn
approval
some
of
them
doubtless
expected
in
a
few
years
to
have
the
honor
of
a
commission
from
the
queen
and
to
wear
a
sword
now
he
himself
had
had
some
experience
of
these
duties
as
a
major
in
a
volunteer
regiment
and
he
was
glad
to
learn
that
they
had
established
a
volunteer
corps
in
their
midst
the
establishment
of
such
an
establishment
conduced
to
a
proper
and
healthy
spirit
which
if
fostered
would
be
of
great
benefit
to
the
land
they
loved
and
were
so
proud
to
belong
to
some
of
those
now
present
expected
he
had
no
doubt
some
of
them
anxiously
looked
forward
to
leading
their
men
against
the
bullets
of
england
foes
to
confronting
the
stricken
field
in
all
the
pride
of
their
youthful
manhood
now
the
reserve
of
a
boy
is
tenfold
deeper
than
the
reserve
of
a
maid
she
being
made
for
one
end
only
by
blind
nature
but
man
for
several
with
a
large
and
healthy
hand
he
tore
down
these
veils
and
trampled
them
under
the
feet
of
eloquence
in
a
raucous
voice
he
cried
aloud
little
matters
like
the
hope
of
honor
and
the
dream
of
glory
that
boys
do
not
discuss
even
with
their
most
intimate
equals
cheerfully
assuming
that
till
he
spoke
they
had
never
considered
these
possibilities
he
pointed
them
to
shining
goals
with
fingers
which
smudged
out
all
radiance
on
all
horizons
he
profaned
the
most
secret
places
of
their
souls
with
outcries
and
gesticulations
he
bade
them
consider
the
deeds
of
their
ancestors
in
such
a
fashion
that
they
were
flushed
to
their
tingling
ears
some
of
them
the
rending
voice
cut
a
frozen
stillness
might
have
had
relatives
who
perished
in
defence
of
their
country
they
thought
not
a
few
of
them
of
an
old
sword
in
a
passage
or
above
a
table
seen
and
fingered
by
stealth
since
they
could
walk
he
adjured
them
to
emulate
those
illustrious
examples
and
they
looked
all
ways
in
their
extreme
discomfort
their
years
forbade
them
even
to
shape
their
thoughts
clearly
to
themselves
they
felt
savagely
that
they
were
being
outraged
by
a
fat
man
who
considered
marbles
a
game
and
so
he
worked
towards
his
peroration
which
by
the
way
he
used
later
with
overwhelming
success
at
a
meeting
of
electors
while
they
sat
flushed
and
uneasy
in
sour
disgust
after
many
many
words
he
reached
for
the
stick
and
thrust
one
hand
in
his
bosom
this
this
was
the
concrete
symbol
of
their
land
worthy
of
all
honor
and
reverence
let
no
boy
look
on
this
flag
who
did
not
purpose
to
worthily
add
to
its
imperishable
lustre
he
shook
it
before
them
a
large
calico
union
jack
staring
in
all
three
colors
and
waited
for
the
thunder
of
applause
that
should
crown
his
effort
they
looked
in
silence
they
had
certainly
seen
the
thing
before
down
at
the
coastguard
station
or
through
a
telescope
high
when
a
brig
went
ashore
on
braunton
sands
above
the
roof
of
the
and
in
keyte
window
where
a
certain
kind
of
striped
sweetmeat
bore
it
in
paper
on
each
box
but
the
college
never
displayed
it
it
was
no
part
of
the
scheme
of
their
lives
the
head
had
never
alluded
to
it
their
fathers
had
not
declared
it
unto
them
it
was
a
matter
shut
up
sacred
and
apart
what
in
the
name
of
everything
caddish
was
he
driving
at
who
waved
that
horror
before
their
eyes
happy
thought
perhaps
he
was
drunk
the
head
saved
the
situation
by
rising
swiftly
to
propose
a
vote
of
thanks
and
at
his
first
motion
the
school
clapped
furiously
from
a
sense
of
relief
and
i
am
sure
he
concluded
the
gaslight
full
on
his
face
that
you
will
all
join
me
in
a
very
hearty
vote
of
thanks
to
raymond
martin
for
the
most
enjoyable
address
he
has
given
to
this
day
we
shall
never
know
the
rights
of
the
case
the
head
vows
that
he
did
no
such
thing
or
that
if
he
did
it
must
have
been
something
in
his
eye
but
those
who
were
present
are
persuaded
that
he
winked
once
openly
and
solemnly
after
the
word
raymond
martin
got
his
applause
full
tale
as
he
said
without
vanity
i
think
my
few
words
went
to
their
hearts
i
never
knew
boys
could
cheer
like
he
left
as
the
rang
and
the
boys
lined
up
against
the
wall
the
flag
lay
still
unrolled
on
the
desk
foxy
regarding
it
with
pride
for
he
had
been
touched
to
the
quick
by
martin
eloquence
the
head
and
the
standing
back
on
the
dais
could
not
see
the
glaring
offence
but
a
prefect
left
the
line
rolled
it
up
swiftly
and
as
swiftly
tossed
it
into
a
glove
and
foil
locker
then
as
though
he
had
touched
a
spring
broke
out
the
low
murmur
of
content
changing
to
they
discussed
the
speech
in
the
dormitories
there
was
not
one
dissentient
voice
raymond
martin
beyond
question
was
born
in
a
gutter
and
bred
in
a
where
they
played
marbles
he
was
further
i
give
the
barest
handful
from
great
store
a
flopshus
cad
an
outrageous
stinker
a
this
was
contribution
and
several
other
things
which
it
is
not
seemly
to
put
down
the
volunteer
fell
in
next
monday
depressedly
with
a
face
of
shame
even
then
judicious
silence
might
have
turned
the
corner
said
foxy
after
a
fine
speech
like
what
you
night
before
last
you
ought
to
take
of
your
drill
with
activity
i
see
how
you
can
avoid
comin
out
an
marchin
in
the
open
ca
we
get
out
of
it
then
foxy
stalky
fine
old
silky
tone
should
have
warned
him
no
not
with
his
giving
the
flag
so
generously
he
told
me
before
he
left
this
morning
that
there
was
no
objection
to
the
corps
usin
it
as
their
own
it
a
handsome
stalky
returned
his
rifle
to
the
rack
in
dead
silence
and
fell
out
his
example
was
followed
by
hogan
and
ansell
perowne
hesitated
look
here
ought
we
he
began
i
get
it
out
of
the
locker
in
a
minute
said
the
sergeant
his
back
turned
then
we
can
come
on
shouted
stalky
what
the
devil
are
you
waiting
for
dismiss
break
why
what
the
where
the
the
rattle
of
sniders
slammed
into
the
rack
drowned
his
voice
as
boy
after
boy
fell
out
i
i
do
know
that
i
sha
have
to
report
this
to
the
head
he
stammered
report
then
and
be
damned
to
you
cried
stalky
white
to
the
lips
and
ran
out
rummy
thing
said
beetle
to
mcturk
i
was
in
the
study
doin
a
simply
lovely
poem
about
the
an
stalky
came
in
an
i
said
an
he
cursed
me
like
a
bargee
and
then
he
began
to
blub
like
anything
shoved
his
head
on
the
table
and
howled
had
we
better
do
something
mcturk
was
troubled
he
smashed
himself
up
they
found
him
with
very
bright
eyes
whistling
between
his
teeth
did
i
take
you
in
beetle
i
thought
i
would
was
it
a
good
draw
did
you
think
i
was
blubbin
did
i
do
it
well
oh
you
fat
old
ass
and
he
began
to
pull
beetle
ears
and
checks
in
the
fashion
that
was
called
i
knew
you
were
blubbin
beetle
replied
composedly
why
are
you
at
drill
drill
what
drill
do
try
to
be
a
clever
fool
drill
in
the
there
is
any
the
volunteer
is
broke
up
disbanded
dead
putrid
corrupt
an
if
you
look
at
me
like
that
beetle
i
slay
you
too
oh
yes
an
i
goin
to
be
reported
to
the
head
for
the
last
term
it
was
within
a
few
days
of
the
holidays
the
examinations
and
more
important
still
the
issue
of
the
college
paper
which
beetle
edited
he
had
been
cajoled
into
that
office
by
the
blandishments
of
stalky
and
mcturk
and
the
extreme
rigor
of
study
law
once
installed
he
discovered
as
others
have
done
before
him
that
his
duty
was
to
do
the
work
while
his
friends
criticized
stalky
christened
it
the
swillingford
patriot
in
pious
memory
of
sponge
and
mcturk
compared
the
output
unfavorably
with
ruskin
and
de
quincey
only
the
head
took
an
interest
in
the
publication
and
his
methods
were
peculiar
he
gave
beetle
the
run
of
his
library
prohibiting
nothing
recommending
nothing
there
beetle
found
a
fat
a
silver
inkstand
and
unlimited
pens
and
paper
there
were
scores
and
scores
of
ancient
dramatists
there
were
hakluyt
his
voyages
french
translations
of
muscovite
authors
called
pushkin
and
lermontoff
little
tales
of
a
heady
and
bewildering
nature
interspersed
with
unusual
songs
peacock
was
that
writer
name
there
was
borrow
lavengro
an
odd
theme
purporting
to
be
a
translation
of
something
called
a
which
the
head
said
was
a
poem
not
yet
come
to
its
own
there
were
hundreds
of
volumes
of
verse
dryden
alexander
smith
lydia
sigourney
fletcher
and
a
purple
island
donne
marlowe
faust
and
this
made
mcturk
to
whom
beetle
conveyed
it
sheer
drunk
for
three
days
ossian
the
earthly
paradise
atalanta
in
calydon
and
rossetti
to
name
only
a
few
then
the
head
drifting
in
under
pretense
of
playing
censor
to
the
paper
would
read
here
a
verse
and
here
another
of
these
poets
opening
up
avenues
and
slow
breathing
with
eyes
above
his
cigar
would
he
speak
of
great
men
living
and
journals
long
dead
founded
in
their
riotous
youth
of
years
when
all
the
planets
were
little
stars
trying
to
find
their
places
in
the
uncaring
void
and
he
the
head
knew
them
as
young
men
know
one
another
so
the
regular
work
went
to
the
dogs
beetle
being
full
of
other
matters
and
meters
hoarded
in
secret
and
only
told
to
mcturk
of
an
afternoon
on
the
sands
walking
high
and
disposedly
round
the
wreck
of
the
armada
galleons
shouting
and
declaiming
against
the
seas
thanks
in
large
part
to
their
experienced
distrust
the
three
for
three
consecutive
terms
had
been
passed
over
for
promotion
to
the
rank
of
prefect
an
office
that
went
by
merit
and
carried
with
it
the
honor
of
the
and
liberty
under
restrictions
to
use
it
said
stalky
come
to
think
of
it
we
done
more
giddy
jesting
with
the
sixth
since
we
been
passed
over
than
any
one
else
in
the
last
seven
he
touched
his
neck
proudly
it
was
encircled
by
the
stiffest
of
collars
which
custom
decreed
could
be
worn
only
by
the
sixth
and
the
sixth
saw
those
collars
and
said
no
word
pussy
abanazar
or
dick
four
of
a
year
ago
would
have
seen
them
discarded
in
five
minutes
or
but
the
sixth
of
that
term
was
made
up
mostly
of
young
but
brilliantly
clever
boys
pets
of
the
too
anxious
for
their
dignity
to
care
to
come
to
open
odds
with
the
resourceful
three
so
they
crammed
their
caps
at
the
extreme
back
of
their
heads
instead
of
a
trifle
over
one
eye
as
the
fifth
should
and
rejoiced
in
boots
on
and
marvellous
ties
on
sundays
no
man
rebuking
mcturk
was
going
up
for
cooper
hill
and
stalky
for
sandhurst
in
the
spring
and
the
head
had
told
them
both
that
unless
they
absolutely
collapsed
during
the
holidays
they
were
safe
as
a
trainer
of
colts
the
head
seldom
erred
in
an
estimate
of
form
he
had
taken
beetle
aside
that
day
and
given
him
much
good
advice
not
one
word
of
which
did
beetle
remember
when
he
dashed
up
to
the
study
white
with
excitement
and
poured
out
the
wondrous
tale
it
demanded
a
great
belief
you
begin
on
a
hundred
a
year
said
mcturk
unsympathetically
rot
and
my
passage
out
it
all
settled
the
head
says
he
been
breaking
me
in
for
this
for
ever
so
long
and
i
never
knew
i
never
knew
one
do
begin
with
writing
straight
off
begin
by
filling
in
telegrams
and
cutting
things
out
o
papers
with
oh
scissors
what
an
ungodly
mess
you
make
of
it
said
stalky
but
anyhow
this
will
be
your
last
term
too
seven
years
my
dearly
beloved
though
not
not
half
bad
years
either
said
mcturk
i
shall
be
sorry
to
leave
the
old
coll
sha
you
they
looked
out
over
the
sea
creaming
along
the
pebbleridge
in
the
clear
winter
light
wonder
where
we
shall
all
be
this
time
next
year
said
stalky
absently
this
time
five
years
said
mcturk
oh
said
beetle
my
leavin
between
ourselves
the
head

brigades
of

beetle
smiling
into

refuge
in
the
flowery
paths
of
inaccurate
fiction
but
a
day
of
reckoning
approaches
beetle

i
myself
have
prepared
a
few
trifling
foolish
questions
in
latin
prose
which
can
hardly
be
evaded
even
by
your
practised
acts
of
deception
latin
prose

wide
and
wonderful
world
a
thousand

beyond
lundy

a
snarl
he
does
know
he
go
on
correctin
exercises
an
jawin
showin
off
before
the
little
boys
next

and
beetle
hurried
after
his
companions
up
the
steep
path
of
the
hill
behind
the
college
they
were
throwing
pebbles
on
the
top
of
the
gasometer
and
the
grimy
in

they
watched

with
tulke
senior
prefect
of
king
house
a
smallish
boy
of
the
type
that
must
be
promoted
on
account
of
its
intellect
and
ever
afterwards
appeals
to
the
head
to
support
its
authority
when
zeal
has
outrun
discretion
the
three
took
no
sort
of
notice
they
were
on
lawful
pass
tulke
repeated
his
question
hotly
for
he
had
suffered
many
slights
from
number
five
study
and
fancied
that
he
had
at
last
caught
them
tripping

said
stalky
exhibiting
the
coin
was
much
to
mary
yeo
and
a
jest
was
more
but
yeu
afraid
said
mcturk
at
the
psychological
moment
aie
beetle
echoed
knowing
her
weak
point
there
not
a
maid
to
northam
think
twice
an
yeou
such
a
fine
maid
tu
mcturk
planted
one
foot
firmly
against
the
inner
door
lest
mother
yeo
should
return
inopportunely
for
mary
face
was
set
it
was
then
that
tulke
found
his
way
blocked
by
a
tall
daughter
of
devon
that
county
of
easy
kisses
the
pleasantest
under
the
sun
he
dodged
aside
politely
she
reflected
a
moment
and
laid
a
vast
hand
upon
his
shoulder
where
be
gwaine
tu
my
dearr
said
she
over
the
handkerchief
he
had
crammed
into
his
mouth
stalky
could
see
the
boy
turn
scarlet
gie
i
a
kiss
do
they
larn
manners
to
college
tulke
gasped
and
wheeled
solemnly
and
conscientiously
mary
kissed
him
twice
and
the
luckless
prefect
fled
she
stepped
into
the
shop
her
eyes
full
of
simple
wonder
kissed
said
stalky
handing
over
the
money
iss
fai
but
oh
my
little
body
he
no
colleger
to
cry
well
we
wo
yell
could
make
us
cry
that
way
said
mcturk
whereupon
mary
cuffed
them
all
round
as
they
went
out
with
tingling
ears
said
stalky
generally
do
think
there
be
much
of
a
prefects
wo
there
just
said
beetle
look
here
if
he
kissed
her
which
is
our
tack
he
is
a
cynically
immoral
hog
and
his
conduct
is
blatant
indecency
orationes
regis
when
he
collared
me
readin
juan
he
kissed
her
said
mcturk
in
the
middle
of
the
street
with
his
on
time
make
a
note
o
that
what
mean
beetle
said
stalky
well
he
a
truthful
little
beast
he
may
say
he
was
and
then
why
then
beetle
capered
at
the
mere
thought
of
it
do
you
see
the
corollary
to
the
giddy
proposition
is
that
the
sixth
ca
protect
from
outrages
an
ravishin
want
nursemaids
to
look
after
we
only
got
to
whisper
that
to
the
coll
jam
for
the
sixth
jam
for
us
either
way
it
jammy
by
gum
said
stalky
our
last
term
endin
well
now
you
cut
along
an
finish
up
your
old
rag
and
turkey
and
me
will
help
we
go
in
the
back
way
no
need
to
bother
do
play
the
giddy
then
beetle
knew
what
help
meant
though
he
was
by
no
means
averse
to
showing
his
importance
before
his
allies
the
little
loft
behind
randall
printing
office
was
his
own
territory
where
he
saw
himself
already
controlling
the
here
under
the
guidance
of
the
inky
apprentice
he
had
learned
to
find
his
way
more
or
less
circuitously
about
the
case
and
considered
himself
an
expert
compositor
the
school
paper
in
its
locked
formes
lay
on
a
table
a
proof
by
the
side
but
not
for
worlds
would
beetle
have
corrected
from
the
mere
proof
with
a
mallet
and
a
pair
of
tweezers
he
knocked
out
mysterious
wedges
of
wood
that
released
the
forme
picked
a
letter
here
and
inserted
a
letter
there
reading
as
he
went
along
and
stopping
much
to
chuckle
over
his
own
contributions
you
wo
show
off
like
that
said
mcturk
when
you
got
to
do
it
for
your
living
upside
down
and
backwards
is
it
let
see
if
i
can
read
get
out
said
beetle
go
and
read
those
formes
in
the
rack
there
if
you
think
you
know
so
formes
in
a
rack
what
that
do
be
so
beastly
mcturk
drew
off
with
stalky
to
prowl
about
the
office
they
left
little
unturned
come
here
a
shake
beetle
what
this
thing
aid
stalky
in
a
few
minutes

said
mcturk
no

said
stalky
that
would
be
wrong
and
painful
to
our
kind
teachers
you
would
crib
willie
would
you
ca
read
the
beastly
stuff
anyhow
was
the
reply
besides
leavin
at
the
end
o
the
term
so
it
makes
no
difference
to
what
the
considerate
bloomer
did
to
spraggon
account
of
the
hounds
we
must
sugar
king
milk
for
him
said
stalky
all
lighted
from
within
by
a
devilish
joy
let
see
what
beetle
can
do
with
those
forceps
he
so
proud
do
see
now
you
can
make
latin
prose
much
more
than
it
is
but
we
try
said
beetle
transposing
an
and
from
two
sentences
let
see
we
put
that
a
little
further
on
and
begin
the
sentence
with
the
next
capital
hurrah
here
three
lines
that
can
move
up
all
in
a
of
those
scientific
rests
for
which
this
eminent
huntsman
is
so
justly
celebrated
stalky
knew
the

a

said

oh

said
stalky
after
a

minutes
zealous

is
relegated
to
a

deos
flebit

my

till

a

said
beetle
as
they
slid
out
of
the
loft
window
into
a
back
alley
of
old
acquaintance
and
started
on
a
trot
to
the
college
but
the
revision
of
the
classics
had
detained
them
too
long
they
halted
blown
and
breathless
in
the
furze
at
the
back
of
the
gasometer
the
college
lights
twinkling
below
ten
minutes
at

late
for

a

is
waiting
for

under

by

it
a

too
because
the
head
gave
us
long
leave
and
one
does
like
to
break
me
now
from
the
bonded
of

where
that
thing
cokey
was
twiddlin
this
afternoon
they
heard
him
groping
in
the
wet
and
presently
beheld
a
great
miracle
the
lights
of
the
coastguard
cottages
near
the
sea
went
out
the
brilliantly
illuminated
windows
of
the
disappeared
and
were
followed
by
the
frontages
of
the
two
hotels
scattered
villas
dulled
twinkled
and
vanished
last
of
all
the

died
also
they
were
left
in
the
pitchy
darkness
of
a

night
my

dead
said
stalky
bunk
they
squattered
through
the
dripping
gorse
as
the
college
hummed
like
an
angry
hive
and
the
chorused
gas
gas
gas
till
they
came
to
the
edge
of
the
sunk
path
that
divided
them
from
their
study
dropping
that
like
bullets
and
rebounding
like
boys
they
dashed
to
their
study
in
less
than
two
minutes
had
changed
into
dry
trousers
and

and
ostentatiously
slippered
joined
the
mob
in
the
which
resembled
the
of
a
south
american
revolution
dark
and
smells
of
cheese
stalky
elbowed
his
way
into
the
press
howling
lustily
for

cokey
must
have
gone
for
a
walk
foxy
have
to

the

rude

were
flicking
across

on
the

that

with
an
unfeigned
dolor
the
fourth
and
upper
third
broke
into
the
school
song
the
vive

to
the
accompaniment
of
drumming
and
the
junior
forms
shrilled
shrieks
and
raided

two
hundred
and
fifty
boys
in

condition
seeking
for

earnest
inquirers
when
a
most
vile
smell
of
gas
told
them
that

had
been

stalky
waistcoat
unbuttoned
sat
gorgedly
over
what
might
have
been
his
fourth
cup
of
tea
and
that
all
right
he
said
hullo
pomponius
ego
it
was
carson
the
head
of
the
school
a
simple
soul
and
a
pillar
of
the
first
fifteen
who
crossed
over
from
the
table
and
in
a
husky
official
voice
invited
the
three
to
attend
in
his
study
in
half
an
hour
prefects
meetin
prefects
meetin
hissed
the
tables
and
they
imitated
barbarically
the
actions
and
effects
of
the
how
are
we
goin
to
jest
with
said
stalky
turning
to
beetle
it
your
play
this
time
look
here
was
the
answer
all
i
want
you
to
do
is
not
to
laugh
goin
to
take
charge
o
young
tulke
immorality
king
and
goin
to
be
serious
if
you
ca
help
laughin
do
look
at
me
or
i
go
i
see
all
right
said
stalky
mcturk
lank
frame
stiffened
in
every
muscle
and
his
eyelids
dropped
half
over
his
eyes
that
last
was
a
the
eight
or
nine
seniors
their
faces
very
set
and
sober
were
ranged
in
chairs
round
carson
severely
philistine
study
tulke
was
not
popular
among
them
and
a
few
who
had
had
experience
of
stalky
and
company
doubted
that
he
might
perhaps
have
made
an
ass
of
himself
but
the
dignity
of
the
sixth
was
to
be
upheld
so
carson
began
hurriedly
look
here
you
chaps
i
we
sent
for
you
to
tell
you
you
a
good
deal
too
cheeky
to
the
sixth
have
been
for
some
time
and
and
we
stood
about
as
much
as
we
goin
to
and
it
seems
you
been
cursin
and
swearin
at
tulke
on
the
bideford
road
this
afternoon
and
we
goin
to
show
you
you
ca
do
it
that
well
that
awfully
good
of
you
said
stalky
but
we
happen
to
have
a
few
rights
of
our
own
too
you
ca
just
because
you
happen
to
be
made
prefects
haul
up
seniors
and
jaw
on
like
a
we
are
fags
carson
this
kind
of
thing
may
do
for
davies
tertius
but
it
wo
do
for
it
only
old
prout
lunacy
that
we
were
prefects
long
ago
you
know
that
said
mcturk
you
have
any
hold
on
said
beetle
a
prefects
meetin
has
to
be
reported
to
the
head
i
want
to
know
if
the
head
backs
tulke
in
this
business
well
well
it
is
exactly
a
prefects
meeting
said
carson
we
only
called
you
in
to
warn
but
all
the
prefects
are
here
beetle
insisted
where
the
difference
my
gum
said
stalky
do
you
mean
to
say
you
just
called
us
in
for
a
jaw
after
comin
to
us
before
the
whole
school
at
tea
an
givin
the
impression
it
was
a
prefects
meeting
my
sam
carson
get
into
trouble
you
business
business
said
mcturk
wagging
his
head
beastly
the
sixth
looked
at
each
other
uneasily
tulke
had
called
three
prefects
meetings
in
two
terms
till
the
head
had
informed
the
sixth
that
they
were
expected
to
maintain
discipline
without
the
recurrent
menace
of
his
authority
now
it
seemed
that
they
had
made
a
blunder
at
the
outset
but
any
boy
would
have
sunk
the
legality
and
been
properly
impressed
by
the
court
beetle
protest
was
distinct
well
you
chaps
deserve
a
lickin
cried
one
naughten
incautiously
then
was
beetle
filled
with
a
noble
inspiration
for
interferin
with
tulke
amours
eh
tulke
turned
a
rich
sloe
color
oh
no
you
do
beetle
went
on
you
had
your
innings
we
been
sent
up
for
cursing
and
swearing
at
you
and
we
goin
to
be
let
off
with
a
warning
we
now
then
you
going
to
catch
i
i
i
tulke
began
do
let
that
young
devil
start
if
you
anything
to
say
you
must
say
it
decently
said
carson
decently
i
will
now
look
here
when
we
went
into
bideford
we
met
this
ornament
of
the
sixth
is
that
decent
enough
hanging
about
on
the
road
with
a
nasty
look
in
his
eye
we
did
know
why
he
was
so
anxious
to
stop
us
at
five
minutes
to
four
when
we
were
in
shop
we
saw
tulke
in
broad
daylight
with
his
on
kissin
huggin
a
woman
on
the
pavement
is
that
decent
enough
for
you
i
did
i
we
saw
you
said
beetle
and
now
i
be
decent
carson
you
sneak
back
with
her
kisses
not
for
nothing
had
beetle
perused
the
later
poets
hot
on
your
lips
and
call
prefects
meetings
which
prefects
meetings
to
uphold
the
honor
of
the
a
new
and
path
opened
before
him
that
instant
and
how
do
we
know
he
shouted
how
do
we
know
how
many
of
the
sixth
are
mixed
up
in
this
abominable
affair
yes
that
what
we
want
to
know
said
mcturk
with
simple
dignity
we
meant
to
come
to
you
about
it
quietly
carson
but
you
would
have
the
meeting
said
stalky
sympathetically
the
sixth
were
too
taken
aback
to
reply
so
carefully
modelling
his
rhetoric
on
king
beetle
followed
up
the
attack
surpassing
and
surprising
himself
it
it
is
so
much
the
cynical
immorality
of
the
biznai
as
the
blatant
indecency
of
it
that
so
awful
as
far
as
we
can
see
it
impossible
for
us
to
go
into
bideford
without
runnin
up
against
some
prefect
unwholesome
amours
there
nothing
to
snigger
over
naughten
i
do
pretend
to
know
much
about
these
things
but
it
seems
to
me
a
chap
must
be
pretty
far
dead
in
sin
that
was
a
quotation
from
the
school
chaplain
when
he
takes
to
embracing
his
paramours
that
was
hakluyt
before
all
the
city
a
reminiscence
of
milton
he
might
at
least
have
the
decency
you
authorities
on
decency
i
believe
to
wait
till
dark
but
he
did
you
did
oh
tulke
you
you
incontinent
little
animal
here
shut
up
a
minute
what
all
this
about
tulke
said
carson
i
look
here
i
awfully
sorry
i
never
thought
beetle
would
take
this
because
you
no
decency
you
thought
i
had
cried
beetle
all
in
one
breath
tried
to
cover
it
all
up
with
a
conspiracy
did
you
said
stalky
direct
insult
to
all
three
of
us
said
mcturk
a
most
filthy
mind
you
have
i
shove
you
fellows
outside
the
door
if
you
go
on
like
this
said
carson
angrily
that
proves
it
a
conspiracy
said
stalky
with
the
air
of
a
virgin
martyr
i
i
was
goin
along
the
street
i
swear
i
was
cried
tulke
and
and
i
awfully
sorry
about
it
a
woman
came
up
and
kissed
me
i
swear
i
did
kiss
there
was
a
pause
filled
by
stalky
long
liquid
whistle
of
contempt
amazement
and
derision
on
my
honor
gulped
the
persecuted
one
oh
do
stop
him
very
good
mcturk
interjected
we
are
compelled
of
course
to
accept
your
confound
it
roared
naughten
you
are
here
oh
well
returned
the
irishman
you
know
tulke
better
than
we
do
i
am
only
speaking
for
ourselves
accept
tulke
word
but
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
i
been
collared
in
a
similarly
disgustin
situation
and
had
offered
the
same
explanation
tulke
has
i
i
wonder
what
have
said
however
it
seems
on
tulke
word
of
honor
and
tulkus
beg
pardon
of
course
is
an
honorable
man
put
in
stalky
that
the
sixth
ca
protect
from
bein
kissed
when
they
go
for
a
walk
cried
beetle
taking
up
the
running
with
a
rush
sweet
business
is
it
cheerful
thing
to
tell
the
fags
ai
it
we
prefects
of
course
but
we
are
kissed
very
much
do
think
that
sort
of
thing
ever
enters
our
heads
does
it
stalky
oh
no
said
stalky
turning
aside
to
hide
his
emotions
mcturk
face
merely
expressed
lofty
contempt
and
a
little
weariness
well
you
seem
to
know
a
lot
about
it
interposed
a
prefect
ca
help
it
when
you
chaps
shove
it
under
our
beetle
dropped
into
a
drawling
parody
of
king
most
biting
colloquial
style
the
gentle
rain
after
the
well
it
all
very
sufficiently
vile
and
disgraceful
is
it
i
do
know
who
comes
out
of
it
worst
tulke
who
happens
to
have
been
caught
or
the
other
fellows
who
have
and
we
here
he
wheeled
fiercely
on
the
other
two
got
to
stand
up
and
be
jawed
by
them
because
we
disturbed
their
hang
it
i
only
wanted
to
give
you
a
word
of
warning
said
carson
thereby
handing
himself
bound
to
the
enemy
warn
you
this
with
the
air
of
one
who
finds
loathsome
gifts
in
his
locker
carson
would
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
us
what
conceivable
thing
there
is
that
you
are
entitled
to
warn
us
about
after
this
exposure
warn
oh
it
a
little
too
much
let
go
somewhere
where
it
the
door
banged
behind
their
outraged
innocence
oh
beetle
beetle
beetle
golden
beetle
sobbed
stalky
hurling
himself
on
beetle
panting
bosom
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
study
however
did
you
do
it
man
said
mcturk
embracing
beetle
head
with
both
arms
while
he
swayed
it
to
and
fro
on
the
neck
in
time
to
this
ancient
burden
pretty
lips
sweeter
than
cherry
or
plum
always
look
jolly
and
never
look
glum
seem
to
say
come
away
kissy
come
come
look
out
you
smash
my
puffed
beetle
emerging
it
glorious
did
i
splendidly
did
you
spot
my
cribs
from
king
oh
blow
his
countenance
clouded
there
one
adjective
i
did
use
obscene
do
know
how
i
forgot
that
it
one
of
pet
ones
never
mind
they
be
sendin
ambassadors
round
in
half
a
shake
to
beg
us
not
to
tell
the
school
it
a
deuced
serious
business
for
them
said
mcturk
poor
sixth
poor
old
sixth
immoral
young
rips
stalky
snorted
what
an
example
to
boys
like
you
and
me
and
the
sixth
in
carson
study
sat
aghast
glowering
at
tulke
who
was
on
the
edge
of
tears
well
said
the
acidly
you
made
a
pretty
average
ghastly
mess
of
it
why
why
did
you
lick
that
young
devil
beetle
before
he
began
jawing
tulke
wailed
i
knew
there
be
a
row
said
a
prefect
of
prout
house
but
you
would
insist
on
the
meeting
yes
and
a
fat
lot
of
good
it
done
us
said
naughten
they
come
in
here
and
jaw
our
heads
off
when
we
ought
to
be
jawin
them
beetle
talks
to
us
as
if
we
were
a
lot
of
blackguards
and
and
all
that
and
when
they
hung
us
up
to
dry
they
go
out
and
slam
the
door
like
a
all
your
fault
but
i
did
kiss
you
ass
if
you
said
you
and
stuck
to
it
it
would
have
been
ten
times
better
than
what
you
did
naughten
retorted
now
tell
the
whole
school
and
beetle
make
up
a
lot
of
beastly
rhymes
and
but
hang
it
she
kissed
me
outside
of
his
work
tulke
mind
moved
slowly
i
not
thinking
of
you
i
thinking
of
us
i
go
up
to
their
study
and
see
if
i
can
make
keep
quiet
tulke
cut
up
about
this
business
naughten
began
ingratiatingly
when
he
found
beetle
who
kissed
him
this
time
and
i
come
to
ask
you
chaps
and
especially
you
beetle
not
to
let
the
thing
be
known
all
over
the
school
of
course
fellows
as
senior
as
you
are
can
easily
see
um
said
beetle
with
the
cold
reluctance
of
one
who
foresees
an
unpleasant
public
duty
i
suppose
i
must
go
and
talk
to
the
sixth
not
the
least
need
my
dear
chap
i
assure
you
said
naughten
hastily
i
take
any
message
you
care
to
but
the
chance
of
supplying
the
missing
adjective
was
too
tempting
so
naughten
returned
to
that
still
undissolved
meeting
beetle
white
icy
and
aloof
at
his
heels
there
seems
he
began
with
laboriously
crisp
articulation
there
seems
to
be
a
certain
amount
of
uneasiness
among
you
as
to
the
steps
we
may
think
fit
to
take
in
regard
to
this
last
revelation
of
the
ah
obscene
if
it
is
any
consolation
to
you
to
know
that
we
have
decided
for
the
honor
of
the
school
you
understand
to
keep
our
mouths
shut
as
to
these
ah
obscenities
you
ah
have
he
wheeled
his
head
among
the
stars
and
strode
statelily
back
to
his
study
where
stalky
and
mcturk
lay
side
by
side
upon
the
table
wiping
their
tearful
eyes
too
weak
to
move
the
latin
prose
paper
was
a
success
beyond
their
wildest
dreams
stalky
and
mcturk
were
of
course
out
of
all
examinations
they
did
with
the
head
but
beetle
attended
with
zeal
this
i
presume
is
a
on
your
part
said
king
as
he
dealt
out
the
papers
one
final
exhibition
ere
you
are
translated
to
loftier
spheres
a
last
attack
on
the
classics
it
seems
to
confound
you
beetle
studied
the
print
with
knit
brows
i
ca
make
head
or
tail
of
it
he
murmured
what
does
it
mean
no
no
said
king
with
scholastic
coquetry
we
depend
upon
you
to
give
us
the
meaning
this
is
an
examination
beetle
mine
not
a
you
will
find
your
associates
have
no
difficulty
in
tulke
left
his
place
and
laid
the
paper
on
the
desk
king
looked
read
and
turned
a
ghastly
green
stalky
missing
a
heap
thought
beetle
wonder
how
king
get
out
of
it
there
seems
king
began
with
a
gulp
a
certain
modicum
of
truth
in
our
beetle
remark
i
am
er
inclined
to
believe
that
the
worthy
randall
must
have
dropped
this
in
ferule
if
you
know
what
that
means
beetle
you
purport
to
be
an
editor
perhaps
you
can
enlighten
the
form
as
to
what
sir
whose
form
i
do
see
that
there
any
verb
in
this
sentence
at
all
an
an
the
ode
is
all
different
i
was
about
to
say
before
you
volunteered
your
criticism
that
an
accident
must
have
befallen
the
paper
in
type
and
that
the
printer
reset
it
by
the
light
of
nature
no
he
held
the
thing
at
length
our
randall
is
not
an
authority
on
cicero
or
rather
mean
to
shove
it
off
on
randall
whispered
beetle
to
his
neighbor
king
must
ha
been
as
screwed
as
an
owl
when
he
wrote
it
but
we
can
amend
the
error
by
dictating
no
the
answer
came
pat
from
a
dozen
throats
at
once
that
cuts
the
time
for
the
exam
only
two
hours
allowed
sir
is
fair
a
exam
how
we
goin
to
be
marked
for
it
it
all
randall
fault
it
is
our
fault
anyhow
an
exam
an
etc
naturally
king
considered
this
was
an
attempt
to
undermine
his
authority
and
instead
of
beginning
dictation
at
once
delivered
a
lecture
on
the
spirit
in
which
examinations
should
be
approached
as
the
storm
subsided
beetle
fanned
it
afresh
eh
what
what
was
that
you
were
saying
to
maclagan
i
only
said
i
thought
the
papers
ought
to
have
been
looked
at
before
they
were
given
out
hear
hear
from
a
back
bench
king
wished
to
know
whether
beetle
took
it
upon
himself
personally
to
conduct
the
traditions
of
the
school
his
zeal
for
knowledge
ate
up
another
fifteen
minutes
during
which
the
prefects
showed
unmistakable
signs
of
boredom
oh
it
was
a
giddy
time
said
beetle
afterwards
in
dismantled
number
five
he
gibbered
a
bit
and
i
kept
him
on
the
gibber
and
then
he
dictated
about
a
half
of
dolabella
good
old
dolabella
friend
of
mine
yes
said
stalky
pensively
then
we
had
to
ask
him
how
every
other
word
was
spelt
of
course
and
he
gibbered
a
lot
more
he
cursed
me
and
maclagan
mac
played
up
like
a
trump
and
randall
and
the
ignorance
of
the
unscholarly
middle
classes
for
mere
marks
and
all
the
rest
it
was
what
you
might
call
a
final
exhibition
a
last
attack
a
giddy
but
o
course
he
was
blind
squiffy
when
he
wrote
the
paper

the
last
moment
till
the
had
been
paid
and
the
boys
were
filling
the
brakes

them

station

while

carson
corkran
will
now
oblige
with
the
story
of
tulke
an
mary
yeo
slaves
of
the
lamp
part
ii
that
very
infant
who
told
the
story
of
the
capture
of
boh
na
ghee
the
many
inventions
to
eustace
cleaver
novelist
inherited
an
estateful
baronetcy
with
vast
revenues
resigned
the
service
and
became
a
landholder
while
his
mother
stood
guard
over
him
to
see
that
he
married
the
right
girl
but
new
to
his
position
he
presented
the
local
volunteers
with
a
range
two
miles
long
across
the
heart
of
his
estate
and
the
surrounding
families
who
lived
in
savage
seclusion
among
woods
full
of
pheasants
regarded
him
as
an
erring
maniac
the
noise
of
the
firing
disturbed
their
poultry
and
infant
was
cast
out
from
the
society
of
and
decent
men
till
such
time
as
a
daughter
of
the
county
might
lure
him
back
to
right
thinking
he
took
his
revenge
by
filling
the
house
with
choice
selections
of
old
schoolmates
home
on
leave
affable
detrimentals
at
whom
the
maidens
of
the
surrounding
families
were
allowed
to
look
from
afar
i
knew
when
a
was
in
port
by
the
infant
invitations
sometimes
he
would
produce
old
friends
of
equal
seniority
at
others
young
and
blushing
giants
whom
i
had
left
small
fags
far
down
in
the
lower
second
and
to
these
infant
and
the
elders
expounded
the
whole
duty
of
man
in
the
army
i
had
to
cut
the
service
said
the
infant
but
that
no
reason
why
my
vast
stores
of
experience
should
be
lost
to
he
was
just
thirty
and
in
that
same
summer
an
imperious
wire
drew
me
to
his
baronial
castle
got
good
haul
ex
come
it
was
an
unusually
good
haul
arranged
with
a
single
eye
to
my
benefit
there
was
a
baldish
captain
of
native
infantry
shivering
with
ague
behind
an
indomitable
red
nose
and
they
called
him
captain
dickson
there
was
another
captain
also
of
native
infantry
with
a
fair
mustache
his
face
was
like
white
glass
and
his
hands
were
fragile
but
he
answered
joyfully
to
the
cry
of
tertius
there
was
an
enormously
big
and
man
who
had
evidently
not
campaigned
for
years
and
but
still
abanazar
for
all
that
he
adorned
the
indian
political
service
and
there
was
a
lean
irishman
his
face
tanned
with
the
suns
of
the
telegraph
department
luckily
the
baize
doors
of
the
bachelors
wing
fitted
tight
for
we
dressed
promiscuously
in
the
corridor
or
in
each
other
rooms
talking
calling
shouting
and
anon
waltzing
by
pairs
to
songs
of
dick
own
devising
there
were
sixty
years
of
mixed
work
to
be
sifted
out
between
us
and
since
we
had
met
one
another
from
time
to
time
in
the
quick
of
india
a
dinner
camp
or
a
here
a
or
railway
station
up
country
somewhere
else
we
had
never
quite
lost
touch
infant
sat
on
the
banisters
hungrily
and
enviously
drinking
it
in
he
enjoyed
his
baronetcy
but
his
heart
yearned
for
the
old
days
it
was
a
cheerful
babel
of
matters
personal
provincial
and
imperial
pieces
of
old
lists
and
new
policies
cut
short
by
the
roar
of
a
burmese
gong
and
we
went
down
not
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
stairs
to
meet
infant
mother
who
had
known
us
all
in
our
and
greeted
us
as
if
those
had
ended
a
week
ago
but
it
was
fifteen
years
since
with
tears
of
laughter
she
had
lent
me
a
gray
for
amateur
theatricals
that
was
a
dinner
from
the
arabian
nights
served
in
an
hall
full
of
ancestors
and
pots
of
flowering
roses
and
what
was
more
impressive
heated
by
steam
when
it
was
ended
and
the
little
mother
had
gone
away
you
boys
want
to
talk
so
i
shall
say
now
we
gathered
about
an
fire
in
a
gigantic
polished
steel
grate
under
a
ten
feet
high
and
the
infant
compassed
us
about
with
curious
liqueurs
and
that
kind
of
cigarette
which
serves
best
to
introduce
your
own
pipe
oh
bliss
grunted
dick
four
from
a
sofa
where
he
had
been
packed
with
a
rug
over
him
first
time
i
been
warm
since
i
came
we
were
all
nearly
on
top
of
the
fire
except
infant
who
had
been
long
enough
at
home
to
take
exercise
when
he
felt
chilled
this
is
a
grisly
diversion
but
much
affected
by
the
english
of
the
island
if
you
say
a
word
about
cold
tubs
and
brisk
walks
drawled
mcturk
i
kill
you
infant
i
got
a
liver
too
when
we
used
to
think
it
a
treat
to
turn
out
of
our
beds
on
a
sunday
morning
thermometer
degrees
if
it
was
summer
and
bathe
off
the
pebbleridge
ugh
i
do
understand
said
tertius
was
the
way
we
chaps
used
to
go
down
into
the
lavatories
boil
ourselves
pink
and
then
come
up
with
all
our
pores
open
into
a
young
or
a
black
frost
yet
none
of
our
chaps
died
that
i
can
talkin
of
baths
said
mcturk
with
a
chuckle
our
bath
in
number
five
beetle
the
night
rocked
king

give
to
see
old
stalky
now

the
great
man
of
his
century
said
dick

how

dick
four
scornfully
if
you

in
a
tight
place
with

i
have
seen
him
since
the
camp
at
pindi

the
infant

i
went
out

the
same
trooper
with
him
as
raw
as

was
only

and
stalky
what
was
the
trouble
said
mcturk
reaching
forward
absently
to
twitch
my
into
position
oh

his
colonel
trusted
him
to
take
twenty
tommies
out
to
wash
or
groom
camels
or
something
at
the
back
of
suakin
and
stalky
got
embroiled
with
fuzzies
five
miles
in
the
interior
he
conducted
a
masterly
retreat
and
wiped
up
eight
of
he
knew
jolly
well
no
right
to
go
out
so
far
so
he
took
the
initiative
and
pitched
in
a
letter
to
his
colonel
who
was
frothing
at
the
mouth
complaining
of
the
of
support
accorded
to
him
in
his
operations
gad
it
might
have
been
one
fat
brigadier
slangin
another
then
he
went
into
the
staff
that
is
entirely
stalky
said
abanazar
from
his
you
come
across
him
too
i
said
oh

he
replied
in
his
softest
tones
i
was
at
the
tail
of
that
that
epic
do
you
chaps
know
we
did
not
infant
mcturk
and
i
and
we
called
for
information
very
politely

we
got
into
a
mess
up
in
the
hills
a
couple
o
years
ago
and
stalky
pulled
us
through
that
mcturk
gazed
at
tertius
with
all
an
irishman
contempt
for

saxon
heavens
he
said

pointed
to

scornfully
over
the
rug
i
knew

a
whiskey
and
soda
been
drinking
and
ammoniated
quinine
while

my
head

like
a
he
wiped
his
ragged
mustache
above
the
drink
and
his
teeth
chattering
in
his
head
began
you
know
the
expedition
when
we
scared
the
souls
out
of
with
a
field
force
they
dare
fight
against
well
both
tribes
there
was
a
coalition
against
us
came
in
without
firing
a
shot
and
a
lot
of
hairy
villains
who
had
no
more
power
over
their
men
than
i
had
promised
and
vowed
all
sorts
of
things
on
that
very
slender
evidence
pussy

i
was
at
simla
said
abanazar
hastily
never

you
tarred
with
the
same
brush
on
the
strength
of
those
treaties
your
asses
of
politicals
reported
the
country
as
pacified
and
the
government
being
a
fool
as
usual
began
dependin
on
local
supply
for
labor
pussy
of
our
chaps
who
had
no
during
the
campaign
did
think
there
be
any
more
of
it
and
were
anxious
to
get
back
to
india
but
i
been
in
two
of
these
little
rows
before
and
i
had
my
suspicions
i
engineered
myself
into
command
of
a
no
shovellin
only
marching
up
and
down
genteelly
with
a
guard
withdrawn
all
the
troops
they
could
but
i
nucleused
about
forty
pathans
recruits
chiefly
of
my
regiment
and
sat
tight
at
the
while

to
work
as
per
political

some
rippin
in
camp
too

tertius
my
pup

a
pious
little
beast
he
did
like
the
and
so
he
went
down
with
pneumonia
i
rootled
round
the
camp
and
found
tertius
gassing
about
as
a
which
god
knows
he
is
cut
out
for
there
were
six
or
eight
of
the
old
coll
at
we
always
in
force
for
a
frontier
row
but
i
heard
of
tertius
as
a
steady
old
hack
and
i
told
him
he
had
to
shake
off
his
breeches
and
help
tertius
volunteered
like
a
shot
and
we
settled
it
with
the
authorities
and
out
we
went
forty
pathans
tertius
and
me
looking
up
the
macnamara
old
mac
the
sapper
who
played
the
fiddle
so
damnably
at
umballa
mac
party
was
the
last
but
one
the
last
was
stalky
he
was
at
the
head
of
the
road
with
some
of
his
pet
sikhs
mac
said
he
believed
he
was
all
stalky
a
sikh
said
tertius
he
takes
his
men
to
pray
at
the
durbar
sahib
at
amritzar
regularly
as
clockwork
when
he
do
interrupt
tertius
it
was
about
forty
miles
beyond
mac
before
i
found
him
and
my
men
pointed
out
gently
but
firmly
that
the
country
was
risin
what
kind
o
country
beetle
well
no
thank
goodness
but
might
call
it
a
hellish
country
when
we
were
up
to
our
necks
in
snow
we
were
rolling
down
the
khud
the
inhabitants
who
were
to
supply
labor
for
the
do
forget
that
pussy
dear
sat
behind
rocks
and
took
at
us
old
story
we
all
legged
it
in
search
of
stalky
i
had
a
feeling
that
he
be
in
good
cover
and
about
dusk
we
found
him
and
his
as
snug
as
a
bug
in
a
rug
in
an
old
malot
stone
fort
with
a
at
one
corner
it
overhung
the
road
they
had
blasted
out
of
the
cliff
fifty
feet
below
and
under
the
road
things
went
down
pretty
sheer
for
five
or
six
hundred
feet
into
a
gorge
about
half
a
mile
wide
and
two
or
three
miles
long
there
were
chaps
on
the
other
side
of
the
gorge
scientifically
gettin
our
range
so
i
hammered
on
the
gate
and
nipped
in
and
tripped
over
stalky
in
a
greasy
bloody
old
poshteen
squatting
on
the
ground
eating
with
his
men
i
only
seen
him
for
half
a
minute
about
three
months
before
but
i
might
have
met
him
yesterday
he
waved
his
hand
all
sereno
aladdin
hullo
emperor
he
said
just
in
time
for
the
performance
i
saw
his
sikhs
looked
a
bit
battered
your
command
your
subaltern
i
said
all
there
is
of
it
said
stalky
you
want
young
everett
he
dead
and
his
body
in
the
they
rushed
our
last
week
and
got
him
and
seven
men
we
been
besieged
for
five
days
i
suppose
they
let
you
through
to
make
sure
of
you
the
whole
up
me
you
walked
into
a
trap
he
grinned
but
neither
tertius
nor
i
could
see
where
the
deuce
the
fun
was
we
any
grub
for
our
men
and
stalky
had
only
four
days
whack
for
his
that
came
of
dependin
upon
your
asinine
politicals
pussy
dear
who
told
us
that
the
inhabitants
were
friendly
to
make
us
comfy
stalky
took
us
up
to
the
to
see
poor
everett
body
lyin
in
a
foot
o
drifted
snow
it
looked
like
a
girl
of
fifteen
not
a
hair
on
the
little
fellow
face
he
been
shot
through
the
temple
but
the
malots
had
left
their
mark
on
him
stalky
unbuttoned
the
tunic
and
showed
it
to
us
a
rummy
cut
on
the
chest
the
snow
all
white
on
his
eyebrows
tertius
when
stalky
moved
the
lamp
and
it
looked
as
if
he
was
alive
said
tertius
with
a
shudder
the
beastly
look
on
stalky
face
though
with
his
nostrils
all
blown
out
same
as
he
used
to
look
when
he
was
bullyin
a
fag
that
was
a
lovely
we
held
a
council
of
war
up
there
over
everett
body
stalky
said
the
malots
and
were
up
together
havin
sunk
their
blood
feuds
to
settle
us
the
chaps
we
seen
across
the
gorge
were
it
was
about
half
a
mile
from
them
to
us
as
a
bullet
flies
and
they
made
a
line
of
sungars
under
the
brow
of
the
hill
to
sleep
in
and
starve
us
out
the
malots
he
said
were
in
front
of
us
promiscuous
there
good
cover
behind
the
fort
or
they
have
been
there
too
stalky
did
mind
the
malots
half
as
much
as
he
did
the
he
said
the
malots
were
treacherous
curs
what
i
could
understand
was
why
in
the
world
the
two
gangs
did
join
in
and
rush
us
there
must
have
been
at
least
five
hundred
of
stalky
said
they
did
trust
each
other
very
well
because
they
were
ancestral
enemies
when
they
were
at
home
and
the
only
time
they
tried
a
rush
he
hove
a
couple
of
among
and
that
had
sickened
a
bit
it
was
dark
by
the
time
we
finished
and
stalky
always
serene
said
command
now
i
do
suppose
you
mind
my
taking
any
action
i
may
consider
necessary
to
reprovision
the
fort
i
said
course
not
and
then
the
lamp
blew
out
so
tertius
and
i
had
to
climb
down
the
tower
steps
we
did
want
to
stay
with
everett
and
got
back
to
our
men
stalky
had
gone
off
to
count
the
stores
i
supposed
anyhow
tertius
and
i
sat
up
in
case
of
a
rush
they
were
plugging
at
us
pretty
generally
you
know
relieving
each
other
till
the
mornin
mornin
came
no
stalky
not
a
sign
of
him
i
took
counsel
with
his
senior
native
officer
a
grand
old
chap
rutton
singh
from
he
only
grinned
and
said
it
was
all
right
stalky
had
been
out
of
the
fort
twice
before
somewhere
or
other
accordin
to
him
he
said
stalky
come
back
unchipped
and
gave
me
to
understand
that
stalky
was
an
invulnerable
of
sorts
all
the
same
i
put
the
whole
command
on
half
rations
and
set
to
pickin
out
loopholes
about
noon
there
was
no
end
of
a
and
the
enemy
stopped
firing
we
replied
gingerly
because
we
were
awfully
short
of
ammunition
do
suppose
we
fired
five
shots
an
hour
but
we
generally
got
our
man
well
while
i
was
talking
with
rutton
singh
i
saw
stalky
coming
down
from
the
rather
puffy
about
the
eyes
his
poshteen
coated
with
ice
trustin
these
he
said
out
quick
and
snaffle
what
you
can
get
there
a
certain
amount
of
friction
between
the
and
the
malots
just
now
i
turned
tertius
out
with
twenty
pathans
and
they
bucked
about
in
the
snow
for
a
bit
till
they
came
on
to
a
sort
of
camp
about
eight
hundred
yards
away
with
only
a
few
men
in
charge
and
half
a
dozen
sheep
by
the
fire
they
finished
off
the
men
and
snaffled
the
sheep
and
as
much
grain
as
they
could
carry
and
came
back
no
one
fired
a
shot
at
there
did
seem
to
be
anybody
about
but
the
snow
was
falling
pretty
thick
good
enough
said
stalky
when
we
got
dinner
ready
and
he
was
chewin
off
a
cleanin
rod
no
sense
riskin
men
they
holding
a
between
the
and
the
malots
at
the
head
of
the
gorge
i
do
think
these
coalitions
are
much
good
do
you
know
what
that
maniac
had
done
tertius
and
i
shook
it
out
of
him
by
instalments
there
was
an
underground
granary
below
the
and
in
blasting
the
road
stalky
had
blown
a
hole
into
one
side
of
it
being
no
one
else
stalky
he
kept
the
hole
open
for
his
own
ends
and
laid
poor
everett
body
slap
over
the
well
of
the
stairs
that
led
down
to
it
from
the
he
had
to
move
and
replace
the
corpse
every
time
he
used
the
passage
the
sikhs
would
go
near
the
place
of
course
well
he
got
out
of
this
hole
and
dropped
on
to
the
road
then
in
the
night
a
howling
dropped
over
the
edge
of
the
khud
made
his
way
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
forded
the
nullah
which
was
half
frozen
climbed
up
on
the
other
side
along
a
track
he
discovered
and
come
out
on
the
right
flank
of
the
he
had
then
listen
to
this
crossed
over
a
ridge
that
paralleled
their
rear
walked
half
a
mile
behind
that
and
come
out
on
the
left
of
their
line
where
the
gorge
gets
shallow
and
where
there
was
a
regular
track
between
the
malot
and
the
camps
that
was
about
two
in
the
morning
and
as
it
turned
out
a
man
spotted
him
a
so
stalky
abolished
him
quietly
and
left
him
the
malot
mark
on
his
chest
same
as
everett
had
was
just
as
economical
as
i
could
be
stalky
said
to
us
shouted
i
should
have
been
slain
i
never
had
to
do
that
kind
of
thing
but
once
before
and
that
was
the
first
time
i
tried
that
path
perfectly
practicable
for
infantry
you
know
about
your
first
man
i
said
that
was
the
night
after
they
killed
everett
and
i
went
out
lookin
for
a
line
of
retreat
for
my
men
a
man
found
me
i
abolished
him
scragged
him
but
on
thinkin
it
over
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
i
could
find
the
body
i
hove
it
down
some
rocks
i
might
decorate
it
with
the
malot
mark
and
leave
it
to
the
to
draw
inferences
so
i
went
out
again
the
next
night
and
did
the
are
shocked
at
the
malots
perpetratin
these
two
dastardly
outrages
after
they
sworn
to
sink
all
bleed
feuds
i
lay
up
behind
their
sungars
early
this
morning
and
watched
they
all
went
to
confer
about
it
at
the
head
of
the
gorge
annoyed
they
are
wonder
you
know
the
way
stalky
drops
out
his
words
one
by
my
god
said
the
infant
explosively
as
the
full
depth
of
the
strategy
dawned
on
him
man
said
mcturk
purring
rapturously
stalky
stalked
said
tertius
that
all
there
is
to
no
he
did
said
dick
four
do
you
remember
how
he
insisted
that
he
had
only
applied
his
luck
do
you
remember
how
rutton
singh
grabbed
his
boots
and
grovelled
in
the
snow
and
how
our
men
shouted
none
of
our
pathans
believed
that
was
luck
said
tertius
they
swore
stalky
ought
to
have
been
born
a
pathan
and
we
nearly
had
a
row
in
the
fort
when
rutton
singh
said
stalky
was
a
pathan
gad
how
furious
the
old
chap
was
with
my
jemadar
but
stalky
just
waggled
his
finger
and
they
shut
up
old
rutton
singh
sword
was
half
out
though
and
he
swore
cremate
every
and
malot
he
killed
that
made
the
jemadar
pretty
wild
because
he
did
mind
fighting
against
his
own
creed
but
he
was
going
to
crab
a
fellow
mussulman
chances
of
paradise
then
stalky
jabbered
pushtu
and
punjabi
in
alternate
streaks
where
the
deuce
did
he
pick
up
his
pushtu
from
beetle
never
mind
his
language
dick
said
i
give
us
the
gist
of
i
flatter
myself
i
can
address
the
wily
pathan
on
occasion
but
hang
it
all
i
ca
make
puns
in
pushtu
or
top
off
my
arguments
with
a
smutty
story
as
he
did
he
played
on
those
two
old
dogs
o
war
like
a
like
a
concertina
stalky
said
and
the
other
two
backed
up
his
knowledge
of
oriental
nature
that
the
and
the
malots
between
would
organize
a
combined
attack
on
us
that
night
as
a
proof
of
good
faith
they
would
drive
it
home
though
because
neither
side
would
trust
the
other
on
account
as
rutton
singh
put
it
of
the
little
accidents
stalky
notion
was
to
crawl
out
at
dusk
with
his
sikhs
manoeuvre
along
this
ungodly
that
he
found
to
the
back
of
the
position
and
then
lob
in
a
few
long
shots
at
the
malots
when
the
attack
was
well
on
divert
their
minds
and
help
to
agitate
he
said
you
chaps
can
come
out
and
sweep
up
the
pieces
and
we
rendezvous
at
the
head
of
the
gorge
after
that
i
move
we
get
back
to
mac
camp
and
have
something
to
were
commandin
the
infant
suggested
i
was
about
three
months
senior
to
stalky
and
two
months
senior
dick
four
replied
we
were
all
from
the
same
old
coll
i
should
say
ours
was
the
only
little
affair
on
record
where
some
one
was
jealous
of
some
one
were
tertius
broke
in
but
there
was
another
row
between
gul
sher
khan
and
rutton
singh
our
jemadar
said
he
was
quite
right
that
no
sikh
living
could
stalk
worth
a
damn
and
that
koran
sahib
had
better
take
out
the
pathans
who
understood
that
kind
of
mountain
work
rutton
singh
said
that
koran
sahib
jolly
well
knew
every
pathan
was
a
born
deserter
and
every
sikh
was
a
gentleman
even
if
he
could
crawl
on
his
belly
stalky
struck
in
with
some
woman
proverb
or
other
that
had
the
effect
of
doublin
both
men
up
with
a
grin
he
said
the
sikhs
and
the
pathans
could
settle
their
claims
on
the
and
malots
later
on
but
he
was
going
to
take
his
sikhs
along
for
this
job
because
sikhs
could
shoot
they
can
too
give
a
of
ammunition
apiece
and
they
perfectly
and
out
he
gat
said
dick
four
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
and
he
had
a
bit
of
a
snooze
him
and
thirty
sikhs
went
down
through
the
staircase
in
the
tower
every
mother
son
of
salutin
little
everett
where
it
stood
propped
up
against
the
wall
the
last
i
heard
him
say
was
tumbleinga
look
out
you
fall
and
they
tumbleingaed
over
the
black
edge
of
nothing
close
upon
the
combined
attack
developed
across
the
valley
and
malots
in
front
of
us
pluggin
at
long
range
and
yellin
to
each
other
to
come
along
and
cut
our
infidel
throats
then
they
skirmished
up
to
the
gate
and
began
the
old
game
of
calling
our
pathans
renegades
and
invitin
to
join
the
holy
war
one
of
our
men
a
young
fellow
from
dera
ismail
jumped
on
the
wall
to
slang
back
and
jumped
down
blubbing
like
a
child
been
hit
smack
in
the
middle
of
the
hand
saw
a
man
yet
who
could
stand
a
hit
in
the
hand
without
weepin
bitterly
it
tickles
up
all
the
nerves
so
tertius
took
his
rifle
and
smote
the
others
on
the
head
to
keep
them
quiet
at
the
loopholes
the
dear
children
wanted
to
open
the
gate
and
go
in
at
generally
but
that
did
suit
our
book
at
last
near
midnight
i
heard
the
wop
wop
wop
of
stalky
martinis
across
the
valley
and
some
general
cursing
among
the
malots
whose
main
body
was
hid
from
us
by
a
fold
in
the
hillside
stalky
was
at
a
great
rate
and
very
naturally
they
turned
half
right
and
began
to
blaze
at
their
faithless
allies
the
regular
volley
firin
in
less
than
ten
minutes
after
stalky
opened
the
diversion
they
were
going
it
hammer
and
tongs
both
sides
the
valley
when
we
could
see
the
valley
was
rather
a
affair
the
had
streamed
out
of
their
sungars
above
the
gorge
to
chastise
the
malots
and
stalky
i
was
watching
him
through
my
glasses
had
slipped
in
behind
very
good
the
had
to
leg
it
along
the
hillside
up
to
where
the
gorge
got
shallow
and
they
could
cross
over
to
the
malots
who
were
awfully
cheered
to
see
the
taken
in
the
rear
then
it
occurred
to
me
to
comfort
the
so
i
turned
out
the
whole
command
and
we
advanced
la
pas
de
doublin
up
what
for
the
sake
of
argument
we
call
the
malots
left
flank
even
then
if
they
sunk
their
differences
they
could
have
eaten
us
alive
but
they
been
firin
at
each
other
half
the
night
and
they
went
on
firin
queerest
thing
you
ever
saw
in
your
born
days
as
soon
as
our
men
doubled
up
to
the
malots
they
blaze
at
the
more
zealously
than
ever
to
show
they
were
on
our
side
run
up
the
valley
a
few
hundred
yards
and
halt
to
fire
again
the
moment
stalky
saw
our
game
he
duplicated
it
his
side
the
gorge
and
by
jove
the
did
just
the
same
yes
but
said
tertius
you
forgot
him
playin
patsy
mind
the
baby
on
the
bugle
to
hurry
us
did
he
roared
mcturk
somehow
we
all
began
to
sing
it
and
there
was
an
interruption
rather
said
tertius
when
we
were
quiet
no
one
of
the
aladdin
company
could
forget
that
tune
yes
he
played
go
on
finally
said
dick
four
we
drove
both
mobs
into
each
other
arms
on
a
bit
of
level
ground
at
the
head
of
the
valley
and
saw
the
whole
crew
whirl
off
fightin
and
stabbin
and
swearin
in
a
blindin
they
were
a
heavy
hairy
lot
and
we
did
follow
stalky
had
captured
one
prisoner
an
old
pensioned
sepoy
of
years
service
who
produced
his
discharge
an
sportin
old
card
he
had
been
tryin
to
make
his
men
rush
us
early
in
the
day
he
was
sulky
angry
with
his
own
side
for
their
cowardice
and
rutton
singh
wanted
to
bayonet
him
sikhs
do
understand
fightin
against
the
government
after
you
served
it
honestly
but
stalky
rescued
him
and
froze
on
to
him
tight
with
ulterior
motives
i
believe
when
we
got
back
to
the
fort
we
buried
young
everett
stalky
would
hear
of
blowin
up
the
place
and
bunked
we
only
lost
ten
men
all
only
ten
out
of
seventy
how
did
you
lose
i
asked
oh
there
was
a
rush
on
the
fort
early
in
the
night
and
a
few
malots
got
over
the
gate
it
was
rather
a
tight
thing
for
a
minute
or
two
but
the
recruits
took
it
beautifully
lucky
job
we
had
any
badly
wounded
men
to
carry
because
we
had
forty
miles
to
macnamara
camp
by
jove
how
we
legged
it
half
way
in
old
rutton
singh
collapsed
so
we
slung
him
across
four
rifles
and
stalky
overcoat
and
stalky
his
prisoner
and
a
couple
of
sikhs
were
his
bearers
after
that
i
went
to
sleep
you
can
you
know
on
the
march
when
your
legs
get
properly
numbed
mac
swears
we
all
marched
into
his
camp
snoring
and
dropped
where
we
halted
his
men
lugged
us
into
the
tents
like
i
remember
wakin
up
and
seeing
stalky
asleep
with
his
head
on
old
rutton
singh
chest
slept
hours
i
only
slept
seventeen
but
then
i
was
coming
down
with
coming
down
what
rot
he
had
it
on
him
before
we
joined
stalky
in
the
fort
said
tertius
well
need
talk
you
hove
your
sword
at
macnamara
and
demanded
a
every
time
you
saw
him
the
only
thing
that
soothed
you
was
putting
you
under
arrest
every
half
hour
you
were
off
your
head
for
three
do
remember
a
word
of
it
said
tertius
placidly
i
remember
my
orderly
giving
me
milk
how
did
stalky
come
out
mcturk
demanded
purling
hard
over
his
pipe
stalky
like
a
serene
brahmini
bull
poor
old
mac
was
at
his
royal
engineers
wits
end
to
know
what
to
do
you
see
i
was
putrid
with
dysentery
tertius
was
ravin
half
the
men
had
and
macnamara
orders
were
to
break
camp
and
come
in
before
winter
so
stalky
who
had
turned
a
hair
took
half
his
supplies
to
save
him
the
bother
o
luggin
back
to
the
plains
and
all
the
ammunition
he
could
get
at
and
et
rutton
singhi
tramped
back
to
his
fort
with
all
his
sikhs
and
his
precious
prisoners
and
a
lot
of
dissolute
that
he
and
the
prisoner
had
seduced
into
service
he
had
sixty
men
of
sorts
and
his
brazen
cheek
mac
nearly
wept
with
joy
when
he
went
you
see
there
were
any
explicit
orders
to
stalky
to
come
in
before
the
passes
were
blocked
mac
is
a
great
man
for
orders
and
stalky
a
great
man
for
orders
when
they
suit
his
he
told
me
he
was
goin
to
the
engadine
said
tertius
sat
on
my
cot
smokin
a
cigarette
and
makin
me
laugh
till
i
cried
macnamara
bundled
the
whole
lot
of
us
down
to
the
plains
next
day
we
were
a
stalky
told
me
that
macnamara
was
a
simple
godsend
to
him
said
dick
four
i
used
to
see
him
in
mac
tent
listenin
to
mac
playin
the
fiddle
and
between
the
pieces
wheedlin
mac
out
of
picks
and
shovels
and
dynamite
cartridges
well
that
was
the
last
we
saw
of
stalky
a
week
or
so
later
the
passes
were
shut
with
snow
and
i
do
think
stalky
wanted
to
be
found
particularly
just
he
did
said
the
fair
and
fat
abanazar
he
did
ho
ho
dick
four
threw
up
his
thin
dry
hand
with
the
blue
veins
at
the
back
of
it
hold
on
a
minute
pussy
i
let
you
in
at
the
proper
time
i
went
down
to
my
regiment
and
that
spring
five
mouths
later
i
got
off
with
a
couple
of
companies
on
detachment
nominally
to
look
after
some
friends
of
ours
across
the
border
actually
of
course
to
recruit
it
was
a
bit
unfortunate
because
an
ass
of
a
young
naick
carried
a
frivolous
he
inherited
from
his
aunt
into
those
hills
and
the
local
gentry
would
volunteer
into
my
corps
of
course
the
naick
had
taken
short
leave
to
manage
the
business
that
was
all
regular
enough
he
stalked
my
pet
orderly
uncle
it
was
an
infernal
shame
because
i
knew
harris
of
the
ghuznees
would
be
covering
that
ground
three
months
later
and
he
snaffle
all
the
chaps
i
had
my
eyes
on
everybody
was
down
on
the
naick
because
they
felt
he
ought
to
have
had
the
decency
to
postpone
his
his
disgustful
amours
till
our
companies
were
full
strength
still
the
beast
had
a
certain
amount
of
professional
feeling
left
he
sent
one
of
his
aunt
clan
by
night
to
tell
me
that
if
i
take
safeguard
he
put
me
on
to
a
batch
of
beauties
i
nipped
over
the
border
like
a
shot
and
about
ten
miles
the
other
side
in
a
nullah
my
showed
me
about
seventy
men
variously
armed
but
standing
up
like
a
queen
company
then
one
of
stepped
out
and
lugged
round
an
old
bugle
just
like
who
the
man
bancroft
it
feeling
for
his
in
a
farce
and
played
patsy
mind
the
baby
arrah
patsy
mind
that
was
as
for
as
he
could
that
also
was
as
far
as
dick
four
could
get
because
we
had
to
sing
the
old
song
through
twice
again
and
once
more
and
subsequently
in
order
to
repeat
it
he
explained
that
if
i
knew
the
rest
of
the
song
he
had
a
note
for
me
from
the
man
the
song
belonged
to
whereupon
my
children
i
finished
that
old
tune
on
that
bugle
and
is
what
i
got
i
knew
you
like
to
look
at
it
do
we
were
all
struggling
for
a
sight
of
the
unformed
handwriting
i
read
it
aloud
everett
february
dick
or
tertius
the
bearer
of
this
is
in
charge
of
recruits
all
pukka
devils
but
desirous
of
leading
new
lives
they
have
been
slightly
polished
and
after
being
boiled

shape
well
i
want
you
to
give
thirty
of
them
to
my
adjutant
who
though
god
own
ass
will
need
men
this
spring
the
rest
you
can
keep
you
will
be
interested
to
learn
that
i
have
extended
my
road
to

triangulations
rutton
singh
sends
his
best
salaams
i
am
making
some
treaties
and
have
given
my
prisoner
who
also
sends
his
salaams
local
rank
of
khan
bahadur
l
cockran
well
that
was
all
said
dick
four
when
the
roaring
the
shouting
the
laughter
and
i
think
the
tears
had
subsided
i
chaperoned
the
gang
across
the
border
as
quick
as
i
could
they
were
rather
homesick
but
they
cheered
up
when
they
recognized
some
of
my
chaps
who
had
been
in
the
row
and
they
made
a
rippin
good
lot
it
rather
more
than
three
hundred
miles
from
fort
everett
to
where
i
picked
up
now
pussy
tell
the
latter
end
o
stalky
as
you
saw
abanazar
laughed
a
little
nervous
misleading
official
laugh
oh
it
was
much
i
was
at
simla
in
the
spring
when
our
stalky
out
of
his
snows
began
corresponding
direct
with
the
after
the
manner
of
a
king
suggested
dick
four
my
turn
now
dick
he
done
a
whole
let
of
things
he
should
have
done
and
constructively
pledged
the
government
to
all
sorts
of
the
state
ticker
eh
said
mcturk
with
a
nod
to
me
about
that
but
the
embarrassin
part
was
that
it
was
all
so
convenient
so
well
reasoned
do
you
know
came
in
as
pat
as
if
had
access
to
all
sorts
of
information
which
he
could
of
pooh
said
tertius
i
back
stalky
against
the
foreign
office
any
he
done
pretty
nearly
everything
he
could
think
of
except
coins
in
his
own
image
and
superscription
all
under
cover
of
this
infernal
road
and
bein
blocked
by
the
snow
his
report
was
simply
amazin
von
lennaert
tore
his
hair
over
it
at
first
and
then
he
gasped
the
dooce
is
this
unknown
warren
hastings
he
must
be
slain
he
must
be
slain
officially
the
viceroy
never
stand
it
unheard
of
he
must
be
slain
by
his
excellency
in
person
order
him
up
here
and
pitch
in
a
stinger
well
i
sent
him
no
end
of
an
official
stinger
and
i
pitched
in
an
unofficial
telegram
at
the
same
you
this
with
amazement
from
the
infant
for
abanazar
resembled
nothing
so
much
as
a
fluffy
persian
cat
yes
me
said
abanazar
was
much
but
after
what
you
said
dicky
it
was
rather
a
coincidence
because
i
wired
now
has
got
his
wife
your
emperor
is
appeased
i
think
you
better
come
to
life
we
hope
you
all
been
pleased
funny
how
that
old
song
came
up
in
my
head
that
was
fairly
and
encouragin
the
only
flaw
was
that
his
emperor
was
appeased
by
very
long
chalks
stalky
extricated
himself
from
his
mountain
fastnesses
and
leafed
up
to
simla
at
his
leisure
to
be
offered
up
on
the
horns
of
the
but
i
began
surely
the
is
the
proper
his
excellency
had
an
idea
that
if
he
blew
up
one
single
junior
captain
same
as
king
used
to
blow
us
up
he
was
holdin
the
reins
of
empire
and
of
course
as
long
as
he
had
that
idea
von
lennaert
encouraged
him
i
not
sure
von
lennaert
did
put
that
notion
into
his
they
changed
the
breed
then
since
my
time
i
said
stalky
was
sent
up
for
his
wiggin
like
a
bad
little
boy
reason
to
believe
that
his
excellency
hair
stood
on
end
he
walked
into
stalky
for
one
hour
stalky
at
attention
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
so
he
vowed
von
lennaert
pretending
to
soothe
down
his
excellency
topknot
in
dumb
show
in
the
background
stalky
did
dare
to
look
up
or
he
have
now
wherefore
was
stalky
not
broken
publicly
said
the
infant
with
a
large
and
luminous
leer
ah
wherefore
said
abanazar
to
give
him
a
chance
to
retrieve
his
blasted
career
and
not
to
break
his
father
heart
stalky
had
a
father
but
that
did
matter
he
behaved
like
a
like
the
sanawar
orphan
asylum
and
his
excellency
graciously
spared
him
then
he
came
round
to
my
office
and
sat
opposite
me
for
ten
minutes
puffing
out
his
nostrils
then
he
said
if
i
thought
that
hah
he
remembered
that
said
mcturk
governed
india
i
swear
i
become
a
naturalized
muscovite
i
a
this
broken
my
heart
it
take
six
months
in
india
to
mend
it
do
you
think
i
can
get
it
pussy
he
got
it
in
about
three
minutes
and
a
half
and
seventeen
days
later
he
was
back
in
the
arms
of
rutton
singh
horrid
disgraced
with
orders
to
hand
over
his
command
to
cathcart
observe
said
dick
four
one
colonel
of
the
political
department
in
charge
of
thirty
sikhs
on
a
hilltop
observe
my
children
naturally
cathcart
not
being
a
fool
even
if
he
a
political
let
stalky
do
his
shooting
within
fifteen
miles
of
fort
everett
for
the
next
six
months
and
i
always
understood
they
and
rutton
singh
and
the
prisoner
were
as
thick
as
thieves
then
stalky
loafed
back
to
his
regiment
i
believe
i
never
seen
him
i
have
though
said
mcturk
swelling
with
pride
we
all
turned
as
one
man
it
was
at
the
beginning
of
this
hot
weather
i
was
in
camp
in
the
jullunder
doab
and
stumbled
slap
on
stalky
in
a
sikh
village
sitting
on
the
one
chair
of
state
with
half
the
population
grovellin
before
him
a
dozen
sikh
babies
on
his
knees
an
old
harridan
clappin
him
on
the
shoulder
and
a
garland
o
flowers
round
his
neck
told
me
he
was
recruitin
we
dined
together
that
night
but
he
never
said
a
word
of
the
business
at
the
fort
told
me
though
that
if
i
wanted
any
supplies
i
better
say
i
was
koran
sahib
and
i
did
and
the
sikhs
would
take
my
ah
that
must
have
been
one
of
rutton
singh
villages
said
dick
four
and
we
smoked
for
some
time
in
silence
i
say
said
mcturk
casting
back
through
the
years
did
stalky
ever
tell
you
came
to
rock
king
that
night
no
said
dick
four
then
mcturk
told
i
see
said
dick
four
nodding
practically
he
duplicated
that
trick
over
again
nobody
like
that
just
where
you
make
the
mistake
i
said
india
full
of
stalkies
cheltenham
and
haileybury
and
marlborough
chaps
that
we
know
anything
about
and
the
surprises
will
begin
when
there
is
really
a
big
row
who
will
be
surprised
said
dick
four
the
other
side
the
gentlemen
who
go
to
the
front
in
carriages
just
imagine
stalky
let
loose
on
the
south
side
of
europe
with
a
sufficiency
of
sikhs
and
a
reasonable
prospect
of
loot
consider
it
there
something
in
that
but
you
too
much
of
an
optimist
beetle
said
the
infant
well
i
a
right
to
be
ai
i
responsible
for
the
whole
thing
you
need
laugh
who
wrote
now
has
got
his
wife
eh
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
said
tertius
everything
said
i
prove
it
said
the
infant
and
i
have
