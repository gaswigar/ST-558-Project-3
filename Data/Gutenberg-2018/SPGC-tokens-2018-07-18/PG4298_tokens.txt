the
paying
guest
by
george
gissing
chapter
i
it
was
mumford
who
saw
the
advertisement
and
made
the
suggestion
his
wife
gave
him
a
startled
look
you
do
mean
that
it
necessary
have
we
been
extrav
no
nothing
of
the
kind
it
just
occurred
to
me
that
some
such
arrangement
might
be
pleasant
for
you
you
must
feel
lonely
now
and
then
during
the
day
and
as
we
have
plenty
of
room
emmeline
took
the
matter
seriously
but
being
a
young
woman
of
some
discretion
did
not
voice
all
her
thoughts
the
rent
was
heavy
so
was
the
cost
of
clarence
against
this
they
had
set
the
advantage
of
the
fine
air
of
sutton
so
good
for
the
child
and
for
the
mother
both
vastly
better
in
health
since
they
quitted
london
moreover
the
remoteness
of
their
friends
favoured
economy
they
could
easily
decline
invitations
and
need
not
often
issue
them
they
had
a
valid
excuse
for
avoiding
public
entertainments
an
expense
so
often
imposed
by
mere
fashion
the
house
was
roomy
the
garden
delightful
clarence
good
fellow
might
be
sincere
in
his
wish
for
her
to
have
companionship
at
the
same
time
this
advertisement
had
probably
appealed
to
him
in
another
way
young
lady
desires
to
find
a
home
with
respectable
family
in
a
suburb
of
london
or
not
more
than
miles
from
charing
cross
can
give
excellent
references
terms
not
so
much
a
consideration
as
comfort
and
pleasant
society
no
address
louise
higgins
fenchurch
she
read
it
again
and
again
would
be
nice
if
people
said
that
we
were
taking
lodgers
fear
of
that
this
is
evidently
some
person
it
a
very
common
arrangement
nowadays
you
know
they
are
called
paying
guests
of
course
i
should
dream
of
having
anyone
you
thoroughly
like
the
look
of
you
think
asked
emmeline
doubtfully
we
should
quite
family
dear
girl
surely
we
have
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
course
not
clarence
but
and
pleasant
society
what
about
that
society
is
pleasant
enough
i
hope
answered
mumford
gracefully
the
fentimans
this
was
the
only
family
with
whom
they
were
intimate
at
sutton
nice
people
a
trifle
sober
perhaps
and
not
in
conspicuously
flourishing
circumstances
but
perfectly
presentable
afraid
murmured
emmeline
and
stopped
short
you
say
she
added
presently
is
someone
very
well
off
terms
not
so
much
a
consideration
i
tell
you
what
there
can
be
no
harm
in
dropping
a
note
the
kind
of
note
that
commits
one
to
nothing
you
know
shall
i
write
it
or
will
you
they
concocted
it
together
and
the
rough
draft
was
copied
by
emmeline
she
wrote
a
very
pretty
hand
and
had
no
difficulty
whatever
about
punctuation
a
careful
letter
calculated
for
the
eye
of
refinement
it
supplied
only
the
indispensable
details
of
the
writer
position
and
left
terms
for
future
adjustment
so
easy
to
explain
to
people
said
mumford
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
when
he
came
back
from
the
post
you
wanted
a
companion
as
i
quite
sure
you
do
a
friend
coming
to
stay
with
you
for
a
time
that
how
i
should
put
it
a
week
passed
and
there
came
no
reply
mumford
pretended
not
to
care
much
but
emmeline
imagined
a
new
anxiety
in
his
look
be
frank
with
me
dear
she
urged
one
evening
we
living
too
he
answered
her
with
entire
truthfulness
ground
for
serious
uneasiness
there
was
none
whatever
he
could
more
than
make
ends
meet
and
had
every
reason
to
hope
it
would
always
be
so
but
it
would
relieve
his
mind
if
the
end
of
the
year
saw
a
rather
larger
surplus
he
was
now
getting
on
in
life
a
man
ought
to
make
provision
beyond
the
mere
and
so
on
i
look
out
for
other
advertisements
asked
emmeline
dear
no
it
was
just
that
particular
one
that
caught
my
eye
next
morning
arrived
a
letter
signed
e
derrick
the
writer
said
she
had
been
waiting
to
compare
and
think
over
some
two
hundred
answers
to
her
advertisement
really
too
absurd
how
can
i
remember
them
all
but
i
liked
yours
as
soon
as
i
read
it
and
i
am
writing
to
you
first
of
all
will
you
let
me
come
and
see
you
i
can
tell
you
about
myself
much
better
than
writing
would
tomorrow
do
in
the
afternoon
please
telegraph
yes
or
no
to
coburg
lodge
emilia
road
tulse
hill
to
think
over
this
letter
mumford
missed
his
ordinary
train
it
was
not
exactly
the
kind
of
letter
he
had
expected
and
emmeline
shared
his
doubts
the
handwriting
seemed
just
passable
there
was
no
orthographic
error
but
refinement
this
young
person
wrote
too
with
such
singular
nonchalance
and
she
said
absolutely
nothing
about
her
domestic
circumstances
coburg
lodge
tulse
hill
a
decent
enough
locality
doubtless
but
no
harm
in
seeing
her
said
emmeline
at
length
a
telegram
clarence
do
you
know
i
think
she
be
the
right
kind
of
girl
i
was
thinking
of
someone
awfully
grand
and
it
rather
a
relief
after
all
you
see
you
you
are
in
business
be
sure
and
this
girl
seems
to
belong
to
a
business
family
i
only
wish
she
wrote
in
a
more
ladylike
way
emmeline
set
her
house
in
order
filled
the
with
flowers
made
the
spare
bedroom
as
inviting
as
possible
and
after
luncheon
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
in
adorning
her
person
she
was
a
slight
pretty
woman
of
something
less
than
thirty
with
a
good
but
pale
complexion
hair
tending
to
auburn
sincere
eyes
her
little
vanities
had
no
roots
of
she
could
admire
without
envy
and
loved
an
orderly
domestic
life
her
husband
desire
to
increase
his
income
had
rather
unsettled
her
she
exaggerated
the
importance
of
interview
and
resolved
with
nervous
energy
to
bring
it
to
a
successful
issue
if
miss
derrick
should
prove
a
possible
companion
about
four
sounded
the
visitor
ring
from
her
bedroom
window
emmeline
had
seen
miss
derrick
approach
as
the
distance
from
the
station
was
only
five
minutes
walk
the
stranger
naturally
came
on
foot
a
dark
girl
and
of
tolerably
good
features
rather
dressy
with
a
carriage
corresponding
to
the
tone
of
her
letter
an
easy
swing
head
well
up
and
shoulders
squared
how
i
she
is
vulgar
said
emmeline
to
herself
do
like
the
hat
i
do
and
that
sunshade
with
the
immense
handle
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
she
heard
a
clear
unaffected
voice
mumford
at
home
yes
the
aspirate
sounded
thank
goodness
it
surprised
her
on
entering
the
room
to
find
that
miss
derrick
looked
no
less
nervous
than
she
was
herself
the
girl
cheeks
were
flushed
and
she
half
choked
over
her
do
you
do
hope
you
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
house
i
would
have
met
you
at
the
station
if
you
had
mentioned
the
train
oh
but
how
silly
i
should
have
known
you
miss
derrick
laughed
and
seemed
of
a
sudden
much
more
at
ease
i
like
you
for
that
she
exclaimed
mirthfully
just
the
kind
of
thing
i
say
myself
sometimes
and
i
so
glad
to
see
that
you
are
you
must
be
offended
i
mean
you
not
the
kind
of
person
to
be
afraid
of
they
laughed
together
emmeline
could
not
subdue
her
delight
when
she
found
that
the
girl
really
might
be
accepted
as
a
lady
there
were
faults
of
costume
undeniably
money
had
been
misspent
in
several
directions
but
no
glaring
vulgarity
hurt
the
eye
and
her
speech
though
not
strictly
speaking
refined
was
free
from
the
faults
that
betray
low
origin
then
she
seemed
though
there
was
something
about
her
mouth
not
altogether
charming
you
know
sutton
at
all
emmeline
inquired
was
here
before
but
i
like
the
look
of
it
i
like
this
house
too
i
suppose
you
know
a
lot
of
people
here
mrs
mumford
no
there
only
one
family
we
know
at
all
well
our
friends
live
in
london
of
course
they
often
come
out
here
i
do
know
whether
you
are
acquainted
with
any
of
them
the
kirby
simpsons
of
west
kensington
and
hollings
of
highgate
miss
derrick
cast
down
her
eyes
and
seemed
to
reflect
then
she
spoke
abruptly
do
know
any
people
to
speak
of
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
my
mother
has
come
down
with
me
she
waiting
at
the
station
till
i
go
back
then
she
come
and
see
you
you
surprised
well
i
had
better
tell
you
that
i
leaving
home
because
i
ca
get
on
with
my
people
mother
and
i
have
always
quarrelled
but
it
has
been
worse
than
ever
lately
i
must
explain
that
she
has
married
a
second
time
and
higgins
i
glad
to
say
that
is
name
has
a
daughter
of
his
own
by
a
first
marriage
and
we
ca
bear
each
other
miss
higgins
i
mean
some
day
if
i
come
to
live
here
i
daresay
i
shall
tell
you
more
higgins
is
rich
and
i
ca
say
he
unkind
to
me
he
give
me
as
much
as
i
want
but
i
sure
he
be
very
glad
to
get
me
out
of
the
house
i
have
no
money
of
my
own
worse
luck
well
we
thought
it
best
for
me
to
come
alone
first
and
see
just
to
see
you
know
whether
we
were
likely
to
suit
each
other
then
mother
will
come
and
tell
you
all
she
has
to
say
about
me
of
course
i
know
what
it
be
they
all
say
i
a
horrible
temper
i
do
think
so
myself
and
i
sure
i
do
think
i
should
quarrel
with
you
look
so
nice
but
i
ca
get
on
at
home
and
it
better
for
all
that
we
should
part
i
just
do
i
look
older
i
have
learnt
to
do
anything
and
i
suppose
i
shall
never
need
to
you
wish
to
see
society
inquired
mumford
who
was
thinking
rapidly
should
you
prefer
a
few
really
nice
people
i
afraid
i
do
quite
understand
yet
whether
you
want
society
of
the
kind
or
she
left
the
alternative
vague
miss
derrick
again
reflected
for
a
moment
before
abruptly
declaring
herself
feel
sure
that
your
friends
are
the
kind
i
want
to
know
at
all
events
i
should
like
to
try
the
great
thing
is
to
get
away
from
home
and
see
how
things
look
they
laughed
together
emmeline
after
a
little
more
talk
offered
to
take
her
visitor
over
the
house
and
miss
derrick
had
loud
praise
for
everything
she
saw
i
like
about
you
she
exclaimed
of
a
sudden
as
they
stood
looking
from
a
bedroom
window
on
to
the
garden
that
you
put
on
any
you
know
what
i
mean
people
seem
to
me
to
be
generally
either
low
and
ignorant
or
so
high
and
mighty
there
no
getting
on
with
them
at
all
you
just
what
i
wanted
to
find
now
i
must
go
and
send
mother
to
see
you
emmeline
protested
against
this
awkward
proceeding
why
should
not
both
come
together
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
if
it
were
desired
miss
derrick
could
step
into
the
garden
whilst
her
mother
said
whatever
she
wished
to
say
the
girl
assented
and
in
excellent
spirits
betook
herself
to
the
railway
station
emmeline
waited
something
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
a
hansom
drove
up
and
higgins
after
a
deliberate
surveyal
of
the
house
front
followed
her
daughter
up
the
pathway
the
first
sight
of
the
portly
lady
made
the
situation
clearer
to
mumford
louise
derrick
represented
a
certain
stage
of
civilisation
a
degree
of
conscious
striving
for
better
things
higgins
was
prosperous
and
vulgarity
of
a
complexion
much
lighter
than
the
girl
she
still
possessed
a
coarse
comeliness
which
pointed
back
to
the
dairymaid
type
of
damsel
her
features
revealed
at
the
same
time
a
kindly
nature
and
an
irascible
tendency
monstrously
overdressed
and
weighted
with
costly
gewgaws
she
came
forward
panting
and
perspiring
and
before
paying
any
heed
to
her
hostess
closely
surveyed
the
room
mumford
said
the
girl
is
my
mother
mother
this
is
mumford
and
now
please
let
me
go
somewhere
while
you
have
your
talk
that
be
best
that
be
best
exclaimed
higgins
it
is
run
out
into
the
garden
louise
nice
little
mumford
and
louise
seems
quite
taken
with
you
she
does
take
to
people
very
easy
either
of
course
you
can
give
satisfactory
references
i
like
to
do
things
in
a
way
i
understand
your
is
in
the
city
should
wonder
if
he
knows
some
of
friends
yes
i
will
take
a
cup
if
you
please
i
just
had
one
at
the
station
but
it
such
thirsty
weather
and
what
do
you
think
of
louise
because
i
very
much
rather
you
said
plainly
if
you
do
think
you
could
get
on
indeed
i
fancy
we
could
mrs
higgins
i
sure
i
very
glad
it
it
is
everybody
can
get
on
with
louise
i
dessay
she
told
you
a
good
deal
about
me
and
her
stepfather
i
do
think
she
any
reason
to
complain
of
the
treatment
said
you
were
both
very
kind
to
her
interposed
the
hostess
sure
we
to
be
and
he
does
mind
what
he
gives
her
a
note
if
you
believe
me
is
no
more
than
a
sixpence
to
him
when
he
gives
her
presents
you
see
rumford
no
mumford
is
it
i
was
first
married
very
young
scarcely
eighteen
i
was
and
derrick
died
on
our
two
years
after
then
came
of
course
i
waited
a
proper
time
and
one
thing
i
can
say
that
no
woman
was
ever
with
two
than
i
been
i
two
sons
growing
up
hearty
boys
as
ever
you
saw
if
it
was
for
this
trouble
with
louise
she
stopped
to
wipe
her
face
dessay
she
told
you
that
who
was
a
widower
when
i
met
him
has
a
daughter
of
his
first
marriage
her
poor
mother
died
at
the
birth
and
older
than
louise
i
do
mind
telling
mumford
close
upon
and
nothing
like
so
as
louise
neither
he
kindness
itself
but
when
it
comes
to
differences
between
his
daughter
and
daughter
well
it
is
in
nature
he
should
favour
his
own
there
more
but
i
dessay
you
can
guess
and
i
wo
trouble
you
with
things
that
do
concern
you
and
that
how
it
stands
you
see
by
a
rapid
calculation
emmeline
discovered
with
surprise
that
higgins
could
not
be
much
more
than
forty
years
of
age
it
must
have
been
a
life
of
gross
that
had
made
the
woman
look
at
least
ten
years
older
this
very
undesirable
parentage
naturally
affected
emmeline
opinion
of
louise
whose
faults
began
to
show
in
a
more
pronounced
light
one
thing
was
clear
but
for
the
fact
that
louise
aimed
at
a
separation
from
her
relatives
it
would
be
barely
possible
to
think
of
receiving
her
if
higgins
thought
of
coming
down
to
sutton
at
unexpected
moments
no
that
was
too
dreadful
you
wish
higgins
to
entrust
your
daughter
to
me
entirely
dear
rumford
it
very
little
that
wishes
has
to
do
with
it
she
made
up
her
mind
to
leave
and
all
i
can
do
is
to
see
she
gets
with
respectable
people
which
i
feel
sure
you
are
and
of
course
i
shall
have
your
references
emmeline
turned
pale
at
the
suggestion
she
all
but
decided
that
the
matter
must
go
no
further
what
might
your
terms
be
inclusive
higgins
proceeded
to
inquire
at
this
moment
a
servant
entered
with
tea
and
emmeline
sorely
flurried
talked
rapidly
of
the
advantages
of
sutton
as
a
residence
she
did
not
allow
her
visitor
to
put
in
a
word
till
the
door
closed
again
then
with
an
air
of
decision
she
announced
her
terms
they
would
be
three
guineas
a
week
it
was
half
a
guinea
more
than
she
and
clarence
had
decided
to
ask
she
expected
she
hoped
higgins
would
look
grave
but
nothing
of
the
kind
louise
mother
seemed
to
think
the
suggestion
very
reasonable
thereupon
emmeline
added
that
of
course
the
young
lady
would
discharge
her
own
laundress
bill
to
this
also
higgins
readily
assented
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
per
annum
emmeline
kept
repeating
to
herself
and
alas
it
looked
as
if
she
might
have
asked
much
more
the
reference
difficulty
might
be
minimised
by
naming
her
own
married
sister
who
lived
at
blackheath
and
clarence
most
intimate
friend
tarling
who
held
a
good
position
in
a
city
house
and
had
a
most
respectable
address
at
west
kensington
but
her
heart
misgave
her
she
dreaded
her
husband
return
home
the
conversation
was
prolonged
for
emmeline
gave
her
references
and
in
return
requested
the
like
from
higgins
this
astonished
the
good
woman
why
her
husband
was
of
fenchurch
street
oh
a
mere
formality
emmeline
hastened
to
add
for
mumford
satisfaction
so
higgins
very
pompously
named
two
city
firms
and
negotiations
for
the
present
were
at
an
end
louise
summoned
to
the
looked
rather
tired
of
waiting
can
you
have
me
mrs
mumford
she
asked
quite
made
up
my
mind
to
come
afraid
a
day
or
two
must
pass
miss
derrick
references
my
dear
began
higgins
nonsense
it
all
right
anyone
can
see
you
go
always
cutting
short
the
words
in
my
mouth
i
endure
such
behaviour
and
i
wonder
what
rumford
thinks
of
it
i
given
rumford
fair
warning
they
wrangled
for
a
few
minutes
emmeline
feeling
too
depressed
and
anxious
to
interpose
with
polite
commonplaces
when
at
length
they
took
their
leave
she
saw
the
last
of
them
with
a
sigh
of
thanksgiving
it
had
happened
most
fortunately
that
no
one
called
this
afternoon
it
out
of
the
question
thus
she
greeted
her
husband
girl
herself
i
could
endure
but
oh
her
odious
mother
three
guineas
a
week
i
could
cry
over
the
thought
by
the
first
post
in
the
morning
came
a
letter
from
louise
she
wrote
appealingly
touchingly
know
you
could
stand
my
mother
but
do
please
have
me
i
like
sutton
and
i
like
your
house
and
i
like
you
i
promise
faithfully
nobody
from
home
shall
ever
come
to
see
me
so
do
be
afraid
of
course
if
you
wo
have
me
somebody
else
will
i
got
two
hundred
to
choose
from
but
i
rather
come
to
you
do
write
and
say
i
may
come
i
so
sorry
i
quarrelled
with
mother
before
you
i
promise
never
to
quarrel
with
you
i
very
when
i
get
what
i
want
with
much
more
to
the
same
effect
have
her
declared
mumford
not
if
the
old
people
keep
away
you
are
quite
sure
she
sounds
her
quite
she
has
been
to
pretty
good
schools
i
think
and
i
dare
say
i
could
persuade
her
to
get
other
dresses
and
hats
course
you
could
really
it
seems
almost
a
duty
to
take
her
does
it
so
the
matter
was
settled
and
mumford
ran
off
gaily
to
catch
his
train
three
days
later
miss
derrick
arrived
bringing
with
her
something
like
of
luggage
she
bounded
up
the
doorsteps
and
meeting
mumford
in
the
hall
kissed
her
fervently
got
such
heaps
to
tell
you
higgins
has
given
me
twenty
pounds
to
go
on
with
for
myself
i
mean
of
course
he
pay
everything
else
how
delighted
i
am
to
be
here
please
pay
the
cabman
i
got
no
change
a
few
hours
before
this
there
had
come
a
letter
from
higgins
better
written
and
spelt
than
would
have
seemed
likely
mumford
it
ran
is
coming
morning
and
i
hope
you
wo
repent
there
just
one
thing
i
meant
to
have
said
to
you
but
forgot
so
i
say
it
now
if
it
should
happen
that
any
gentleman
of
your
acquaintance
takes
a
fancy
to
and
if
it
should
come
to
anything
i
sure
both
and
me
would
be
and
would
behave
handsome
to
her
and
what
more
i
sure
he
would
be
only
too
glad
to
show
a
handsome
the
thanks
he
would
owe
to
you
and
very
truly
yours

h

chapter
ii
so
the
mumfords
house
was
named
stood
on
its
own
little
plot
of
ground
in
one
of
the
roads
which
persuade
the
inhabitants
of
sutton
that
they
live
in
the
country
it
was
of
red
brick
and
with
a
porch
of
wood
and
stucco
bay
windows
on
one
side
of
the
entrance
and
flat
on
the
other
made
a
contrast
pleasing
to
the
suburban
eye
the
little
front
garden
had
a
close
fence
of
unpainted
lath
a
characteristic
of
the
neighbourhood
at
the
back
of
the
house
lay
a
long
narrow
lawn
bordered
with
and
shaded
at
the
far
end
by
a
fine
emmeline
talked
much
of
the
delightful
proximity
of
the
downs
one
would
have
imagined
her
taking
long
walks
over
the
breezy
uplands
to
banstead
or
epsom
or
yet
further
afield
the
fact
was
she
saw
no
more
of
the
country
than
if
she
had
lived
at
brixton
her
windows
looked
only
upon
the
surrounding
houses
and
their
garden
foliage
occasionally
she
walked
along
the
asphalte
pavement
of
the
brighton
road
a
nursemaids
promenade
as
far
as
the
stone
which
marks
twelve
miles
from
westminster
bridge
here
indeed
she
breathed
the
air
of
the
hills
but
villas
on
either
hand
obstructed
the
view
and
brought
london
much
nearer
than
the
measured
distance
like
her
friends
and
neighbours
emmeline
enjoyed
sutton
because
it
was
a
most
respectable
little
portion
of
the
great
town
set
in
a
purer
atmosphere
the
country
would
have
depressed
her
in
this
respect
miss
derrick
proved
a
congenial
companion
louise
made
no
pretence
of
rural
inclinations
but
had
a
great
liking
for
asphalte
for
the
results
of
elaborate
horticulture
for
the
repose
and
the
quiet
of
villadom
should
like
to
have
a
house
just
like
this
she
declared
on
her
first
evening
at
runnymede
talking
with
her
host
and
hostess
out
in
the
garden
quite
big
enough
unless
of
course
you
have
a
very
large
family
which
must
be
rather
a
bore
she
laughed
ingenuously
one
gets
to
town
so
easily
what
do
you
pay
for
your
mumford
oh
well
that
is
much
i
almost
think
i
shall
get
one
you
wish
to
go
up
very
often
then
asked
emmeline
reflecting
on
her
new
responsibilities
not
every
day
of
course
but
a
saves
the
bother
each
time
and
you
have
a
sort
of
feeling
you
know
that
you
can
be
in
town
whenever
you
like
it
had
not
hitherto
been
the
mumfords
wont
to
dress
for
dinner
but
this
evening
they
did
so
and
obviously
to
miss
gratification
she
herself
appeared
in
a
dress
which
altogether
outshone
that
of
her
hostess
afterwards
in
private
she
drew
emmeline
attention
to
this
garb
and
frankly
asked
her
opinion
of
it
nice
indeed
murmured
the
married
lady
with
a
smile
a
little
i
know
what
you
going
to
say
you
think
it
too
showy
now
i
want
you
to
tell
me
just
what
you
think
about
everything
everything
i
sha
be
offended
i
not
so
silly
you
know
i
come
here
to
learn
all
sorts
of
things
you
shall
go
over
all
my
dresses
with
me
and
those
you
do
like
get
rid
of
i
never
had
anyone
to
tell
me
what
nice
and
what
is
i
want
to
be
oh
well
you
know
what
i
mean
my
dear
said
emmeline
something
i
do
quite
understand
you
say
i
to
speak
plainly
and
so
i
will
how
is
it
that
you
have
made
friends
long
ago
with
the
sort
of
people
you
wish
to
know
it
is
as
if
you
were
in
poor
circumstances
i
make
friends
with
nice
people
when
i
was
ashamed
to
have
them
at
home
the
best
i
know
are
quite
poor
girls
i
went
to
school
with
they
much
better
educated
than
i
am
but
they
make
their
own
living
and
so
i
ca
see
very
much
of
them
and
i
not
sure
they
want
to
see
much
of
i
wish
i
knew
what
people
think
of
me
they
call
me
vulgar
i
believe
the
kind
i
speaking
of
now
do
tell
me
mumford
i
vulgar
dear
miss
derrick
emmeline
began
in
protest
but
was
at
once
interrupted
that
is
what
i
want
you
must
call
me
louise
or
lou
if
you
like
and
just
say
what
you
really
think
yes
i
see
i
rather
vulgar
and
what
can
you
expect
look
at
mother
and
if
you
saw
higgins
oh
the
mistake
i
made
was
to
leave
school
so
soon
i
got
sick
of
it
and
left
at
sixteen
and
of
course
the
idiots
at
home
i
mean
the
foolish
people
let
me
have
my
own
way
i
not
clever
you
know
and
i
did
get
on
well
at
school
they
used
to
say
i
could
do
much
better
if
i
liked
and
perhaps
it
was
more
laziness
than
stupidity
though
i
do
care
for
books
i
wish
i
did
i
had
lots
of
friends
but
i
never
keep
them
for
very
long
i
do
know
whether
it
their
fault
or
mine
my
oldest
friends
are
amy
barker
and
muriel
featherstone
they
were
both
at
the
school
at
clapham
and
now
amy
does
in
the
city
and
muriel
is
at
a
photographer
they
awfully
nice
girls
and
i
like
them
so
much
but
then
you
see
they
have
enough
money
to
live
in
what
call
a
nice
way
and
you
know
i
should
never
think
of
asking
them
to
advise
me
about
my
dresses
or
anything
of
that
kind
a
friend
of
mine
once
began
to
say
something
and
i
did
like
it
after
that
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
each
other
emmeline
could
not
hide
her
amusement
that
just
it
went
on
the
other
frankly
rather
a
sharp
temper
and
i
suppose
i
do
get
on
well
with
most
people
i
used
to
quarrel
dreadfully
with
some
of
the
girls
at
school
the
uppish
sort
and
yet
all
the
time
i
wanted
to
be
friends
with
them
but
of
course
i
could
never
have
taken
them
home
mumford
began
to
read
the
girl
character
and
to
understand
how
its
complexity
had
shaped
her
life
she
was
still
uneasy
as
to
the
impression
this
guest
would
make
upon
their
friends
but
on
the
whole
it
seemed
probable
that
louise
would
conscientiously
submit
herself
to
instruction
and
do
her
very
best
to
be
nice
clarence
opinion
was
still
favourable
he
pronounced
miss
derrick
very
amusing
and
less
of
a
savage
than
his
wife
description
had
led
him
to
expect
having
the
assistance
of
two
servants
and
a
emmeline
was
not
overburdened
with
domestic
work
she
soon
found
it
fortunate
that
her
child
a
girl
of
two
years
old
needed
no
great
share
of
her
attention
for
miss
derrick
though
at
first
she
affected
an
extravagant
interest
in
the
baby
very
soon
had
enough
of
that
plaything
and
showed
a
decided
preference
for
emmeline
society
out
of
sight
and
hearing
of
nursery
affairs
on
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
they
went
together
to
call
upon
fentiman
who
lived
at
a
distance
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
walk
in
a
house
called
hazeldene
a
house
considerably
smaller
than
runnymede
and
neither
without
nor
within
so
pleasant
to
look
upon
fentiman
a
tall
but
amiable
lady
had
two
young
children
who
occupied
most
of
her
time
at
present
one
of
them
was
ailing
and
the
mother
could
talk
of
nothing
else
but
this
distressing
circumstance
the
call
lasted
only
for
ten
minutes
and
emmeline
felt
that
her
companion
was
disappointed
are
a
great
trouble
louise
remarked
when
they
had
left
the
house
ought
never
to
marry
unless
they
can
keep
a
lot
of
servants
not
long
ago
i
was
rather
fond
of
somebody
but
i
would
have
him
because
he
had
no
money
do
you
think
i
was
quite
right
have
no
doubt
you
were
now
pursued
the
girl
poking
the
ground
with
her
sunshade
as
she
walked
somebody
else
and
that
one
of
the
things
i
want
to
tell
you
about
he
has
about
three
hundred
a
year
it
much
of
course
but
i
suppose
higgins
would
give
me
something
and
yet
i
sure
it
wo
come
to
anything
let
go
home
and
have
a
good
talk
shall
we
higgins
letter
had
caused
emmeline
and
her
husband
no
little
amusement
but
at
the
same
time
it
led
them
to
reflect
certainly
they
numbered
among
their
acquaintances
one
or
two
marriageable
young
men
who
might
perchance
be
attracted
by
miss
derrick
especially
if
they
learnt
that
higgins
was
disposed
to
handsomely
to
his
stepdaughter
but
the
mumfords
had
no
desire
to
see
louise
speedily
married
to
the
bribe
with
which
the
letter
ended
they
could
give
no
serious
thought
having
secured
their
paying
guest
they
hoped
she
would
remain
with
them
for
a
year
or
two
at
least
but
already
louise
had
dropped
hints
such
as
emmeline
could
not
fail
to
understand
and
her
avowal
of
serious
interest
in
a
lover
came
rather
as
an
annoyance
than
a
surprise
to
mumford
it
was
a
hot
afternoon
and
they
had
tea
brought
out
into
the
garden
under
the
rustling
leaves
of
the
chestnut
do
know
anyone
else
at
sutton
except
mrs
fentiman
said
louise
as
she
leaned
back
in
the
wicker
chair
intimately
but
some
of
our
friends
from
london
will
be
coming
on
sunday
i
asked
four
people
to
lunch
jolly
of
course
you
tell
me
all
about
them
before
then
but
i
want
to
talk
about
cobb
please
lumps
of
sugar
known
him
for
about
a
year
and
a
half
we
seem
quite
old
friends
and
he
writes
to
me
i
do
answer
the
letters
unless
something
to
say
to
tell
the
truth
i
do
like
him
can
that
be
if
you
seem
old
friends
he
likes
and
there
no
harm
in
that
so
long
as
he
understands
i
sure
would
like
him
he
a
rough
coarse
sort
of
man
and
has
a
dreadful
temper
gracious
what
is
his
position
he
connected
with
the
d
electric
lighting
company
he
travels
about
a
good
deal
i
should
mind
that
it
must
be
rather
nice
not
to
have
one
husband
always
at
home
just
now
i
believe
he
in
ireland
i
shall
be
having
a
letter
from
him
very
soon
no
doubt
he
does
know
i
left
home
and
it
make
him
wild
yes
that
the
kind
of
man
he
is
fearfully
jealous
and
such
a
temper
if
i
married
him
i
quite
sure
he
would
beat
me
some
day
emmeline
exclaimed
can
you
have
anything
to
do
with
such
a
man
very
nice
sometimes
answered
louise
thoughtfully
do
you
really
mean
that
he
is
rough
and
coarse
i
do
you
could
call
him
a
gentleman
i
never
seen
his
people
they
live
somewhere
a
long
way
off
and
i
should
wonder
if
they
are
a
horrid
lot
his
last
letter
was
quite
insulting
he
said
let
me
see
what
was
it
yes
you
have
neither
heart
nor
brains
and
i
shall
do
my
best
not
to
waste
another
thought
on
you
what
do
you
think
of
that
seems
very
extraordinary
my
dear
how
can
he
write
to
you
in
that
way
if
you
never
gave
him
any
encouragement
but
i
suppose
i
have
done
we
met
on
the
common
now
and
then
and
and
that
kind
of
thing
i
afraid
you
shocked
mumford
i
know
it
is
the
way
that
nice
people
behave
and
going
to
give
it
up
your
mother
know
him
yes
there
no
secret
about
it
mother
rather
likes
him
of
course
he
behaves
himself
when
he
at
the
house
i
a
good
mind
to
ask
him
to
call
here
so
that
you
could
see
him
yes
i
should
like
you
to
see
him
you
would
mind
if
you
really
wish
it
louise
but
i
ca
help
thinking
you
exaggerate
his
faults
a
bit
he
a
regular
brute
when
he
gets
angry
dear
emmeline
interposed
softly
is
quite
a
ladylike
expression
it
is
thank
you
mumford
i
meant
to
say
he
is
horrid
very
disagreeable
then
there
something
else
i
want
to
tell
you
about
cissy
higgins
that
higgins
daughter
you
know
is
half
engaged
to
a
man
called
bowling
an
awful
idiot
do
think
i
would
use
that
word
dear
you
mumford
i
mean
to
say
he
a
regular
silly
but
he
in
a
very
good
position
a
partner
in
jannaway
brothers
of
woolwich
though
he
is
thirty
yet
well
now
what
do
you
think
mr
bowling
does
seem
to
know
his
own
mind
and
just
lately
been
paying
so
much
attention
to
that
cissy
has
got
quite
frantic
about
it
this
was
really
and
truly
the
reason
why
i
left
home
see
murmured
the
listener
with
a
look
of
genuine
interest
they
wanted
to
get
me
out
of
the
way
there
was
the
slightest
fear
that
i
should
try
to
cut
cissy
higgins
out
but
it
was
getting
very
awkward
for
her
i
admit
now
that
the
kind
of
thing
that
does
go
on
among
nice
people
is
it
what
do
you
mean
louise
when
you
say
that
miss
higgins
and
mr
bowling
are
engaged
i
mean
she
has
refused
him
once
just
for
form
sake
but
he
knows
very
well
she
means
to
have
him
people
of
your
kind
do
do
that
sort
of
thing
do
they
hardly
know
emmeline
replied
colouring
a
little
at
certain
private
reminiscences
am
i
to
understand
that
you
would
on
any
account
listen
to
mr
bowling
louise
laughed
there
no
knowing
what
i
might
do
to
spite
cissy
we
hate
each
other
of
course
but
i
ca
fancy
myself
marrying
him
he
has
a
long
nose
and
talks
through
it
and
he
says
think
you
for
thank
you
and
he
sings
oh
to
hear
him
sing
i
ca
bear
the
man
the
matter
of
this
conversation
emmeline
reported
to
her
husband
at
night
and
they
agreed
in
the
hope
that
neither
cobb
nor
mr
bowling
would
make
an
appearance
at
runnymede
mumford
opined
that
these
individuals
were
cads
small
wonder
he
said
that
the
girl
wished
to
enter
a
new
social
sphere
his
wife
on
the
other
hand
had
a
suspicion
that
miss
derrick
would
not
be
content
to
see
the
last
of
cobb
he
the
electrical
engineer
or
whatever
he
was
could
hardly
be
such
a
ruffian
as
the
girl
depicted
his
words
have
neither
heart
nor
brains
seemed
to
indicate
anything
but
a
coarse
mind
what
a
lot
they
are
mumford
observed
suppose
people
of
that
sort
quarrel
and
abuse
each
other
merely
to
pass
the
time
they
seem
to
be
just
one
degree
above
the
roughs
who
come
to
blows
and
get
into
the
police
court
you
must
really
do
your
best
to
get
the
girl
out
of
it
i
sure
she
is
worthy
of
better
things
is
in
one
way
answered
his
wife
judicially
her
education
stopped
too
soon
i
doubt
if
it
possible
to
change
her
very
much
and
i
really
should
like
after
all
to
see
mr
cobb
mumford
broke
into
a
laugh
you
go
the
eternal
feminine
you
have
her
married
in
six
months
be
vulgar
clarence
and
we
talked
enough
of
louise
for
the
present
miss
derrick
presentiment
that
a
letter
from
cobb
would
soon
reach
her
was
justified
the
next
day
it
arrived
in
the
afternoon
readdressed
from
tulse
hill
emmeline
observed
the
eagerness
with
which
this
epistle
was
pounced
upon
and
carried
off
for
private
perusal
she
saw
too
that
in
time
louise
left
the
house
doubtless
to
post
a
reply
but
to
her
surprise
not
a
word
of
the
matter
escaped
miss
derrick
during
the
whole
evening
in
her
louise
had
learned
to
play
the
piano
but
caring
little
or
nothing
for
music
she
had
hardly
touched
a
key
for
several
years
now
the
idea
possessed
her
that
she
must
resume
her
practising
and
she
had
spent
hours
at
the
piano
with
painful
effect
upon
mumford
nerves
after
dinner
she
offered
to
play
to
mumford
and
he
fellow
stood
by
her
to
turn
over
the
leaves
emmeline
with
fancy
work
in
her
hands
watched
the
two
she
was
not
one
of
the
most
foolish
of
her
sex
but
it
relieved
her
when
clarence
moved
away
the
next
morning
louise
was
an
hour
late
for
breakfast
she
came
down
when
mumford
had
left
the
house
and
emmeline
saw
with
surprise
that
she
was
dressed
for
going
out
a
cup
of
coffee
please
i
no
appetite
this
morning
and
i
want
to
catch
a
train
for
victoria
as
soon
as
possible
will
you
be
back
i
do
quite
know
to
tea
i
think
the
girl
had
all
at
once
grown
reticent
and
her
lips
showed
the
less
amiable
possibilities
of
their
contour
chapter
iii
at
she
had
not
returned
it
being
saturday
mumford
was
back
early
in
the
afternoon
and
miss
derrick
absence
caused
no
grief
emmeline
could
play
with
baby
in
the
garden
whilst
her
husband
smoked
his
pipe
and
looked
on
in
the
old
comfortable
way
they
already
felt
that
domestic
life
was
not
quite
the
same
with
a
stranger
to
share
it
doubtless
they
would
get
used
to
the
new
restraints
but
miss
derrick
must
not
expect
them
to
disorganise
their
mealtimes
on
her
account
promptly
at
seven
they
sat
down
to
dine
and
had
just
risen
from
the
table
when
louise
appeared
she
was
in
excellent
spirits
without
a
trace
of
the
no
apologies
if
she
did
feel
quite
free
to
come
and
go
without
putting
people
out
there
would
be
no
comfort
in
life
a
slice
of
the
joint
that
was
all
she
wanted
and
she
would
have
done
in
a
few
minutes
taken
tickets
for
toole
theatre
on
monday
night
you
must
both
come
you
can
ca
you
mumford
and
his
wife
glanced
at
each
other
yes
they
could
go
it
was
very
kind
of
miss
derrick
but
all
right
it
be
jolly
the
idea
struck
me
in
the
train
as
i
was
going
up
so
i
took
a
cab
from
victoria
and
booked
the
places
first
thing
third
row
from
the
front
dress
circle
the
best
i
could
do
please
let
me
have
my
dinner
alone
mumford
i
want
to
tell
you
something
afterwards
clarence
went
round
to
see
his
friend
fentiman
with
whom
he
usually
had
a
chat
on
saturday
evening
emmeline
was
soon
joined
by
the
guest
in
the
you
may
read
that
said
louise
holding
out
a
letter
from
cobb
came
yesterday
but
i
did
care
to
talk
about
it
then
yes
please
read
it
i
want
you
to
reluctantly
but
with
curiosity
emmeline
glanced
over
the
sheet
cobb
wrote
in
ignorance
of
miss
derrick
having
left
home
it
was
a
plain
formal
letter
giving
a
brief
account
of
his
doings
in
ireland
and
making
a
request
that
louise
would
meet
him
if
possible
on
streatham
common
at
three
on
saturday
afternoon
and
he
signed
himself
sincerely
yours
made
up
my
mind
at
once
said
the
girl
i
would
meet
him
that
kind
of
thing
will
have
to
stop
i
not
going
to
think
any
more
of
him
and
it
better
to
make
him
understand
it
at
once
is
it
emmeline
heartily
concurred
pursued
the
other
with
an
air
of
great
satisfaction
thought
i
had
better
go
home
for
this
afternoon
because
when
he
did
see
me
on
the
common
he
was
pretty
sure
to
call
at
the
house
and
i
did
want
mother
or
cissy
to
be
talking
about
me
to
him
before
he
had
heard
my
own
explanation
you
answer
the
letter
asked
emmeline
i
just
sent
a
line
to
mother
to
let
her
know
i
was
coming
over
so
that
she
might
stay
at
home
well
and
it
happened
just
as
i
thought
cobb
came
to
the
house
at
three
but
before
that
i
had
a
terrible
row
with
cissy
that
is
a
nice
expression
i
know
but
it
really
was
one
of
our
worst
quarrels
mr
bowling
has
been
near
since
i
left
and
cissy
is
furious
she
said
such
things
that
i
had
to
tell
her
very
plainly
what
i
thought
of
her
and
she
positively
foamed
at
the
mouth
now
look
here
she
said
if
i
find
out
that
he
goes
to
sutton
you
see
what
will
happen
will
happen
i
asked
father
will
stop
your
allowance
and
you
have
to
get
on
as
best
you
can
oh
very
well
i
said
in
that
case
i
shall
marry
mr
bowling
you
should
have
seen
her
rage
you
said
you
would
marry
him
if
he
had
ten
thousand
a
year
she
screamed
i
dare
say
i
did
but
if
nothing
to
live
upon
you
can
marry
your
cobb
ca
you
and
she
almost
cried
and
i
should
have
felt
sorry
for
her
if
she
had
made
me
so
angry
no
i
said
i
ca
marry
cobb
and
i
never
dreamt
of
marrying
cobb
and
emmeline
interposed
louise
that
kind
of
talk
is
at
all
ladylike
what
a
pity
you
went
home
i
was
sorry
for
it
afterwards
i
sha
go
again
for
a
long
time
i
promise
you
i
wo
however
cobb
came
and
i
saw
him
alone
he
was
astonished
when
he
heard
what
had
been
going
on
he
was
astonished
at
too
i
mean
the
way
i
spoke
i
wanted
him
to
understand
at
once
that
there
was
nothing
between
us
i
talked
in
rather
a
you
know
the
sort
of
way
she
raised
her
chin
slightly
and
looked
down
from
under
her
eyelids
i
assure
you
i
behaved
quite
nicely
but
he
got
into
a
rage
as
he
always
does
and
began
to
call
me
names
and
i
would
stand
it
cobb
i
said
very
severely
either
you
will
conduct
yourself
properly
or
you
will
leave
the
house
then
he
tried
another
tone
and
said
very
different
things
the
kind
of
thing
one
likes
to
hear
you
know
but
i
pretended
that
i
did
care
for
it
a
bit
it
all
over
between
us
then
he
shouted
at
last
yes
really
shouted
and
i
sure
people
must
have
heard
all
over
i
said
but
there
never
anything
nothing
serious
oh
all
right
then
and
off
he
rushed
and
i
dare
say
i
seen
the
last
of
him
for
a
time
do
try
to
live
quietly
my
dear
said
emmeline
on
with
your
music
and
read
a
little
each
day
that
just
what
i
going
to
do
dear
mumford
and
your
friends
will
be
here
it
be
so
quiet
and
nice
and
on
monday
we
shall
go
to
the
theatre
just
for
a
change
and
i
not
going
to
think
of
those
people
it
all
settled
i
shall
live
very
quietly
indeed
she
banged
on
the
piano
till
nearly
eleven
and
went
off
to
bed
with
a
smile
of
virtuous
contentment
the
guests
who
arrived
on
sunday
morning
were
and
grove
bilton
and
dunnill
grove
was
emmeline
elder
sister
a
merry
talkative
kindly
woman
aware
of
the
circumstances
she
at
once
made
friends
with
miss
derrick
and
greatly
pleased
that
young
lady
by
a
skilful
blending
of
superior
talk
with
easy
homeliness
bilton
a
stockbroker
clerk
represented
the
better
kind
of
city
young
man
athletic
yet
intelligent
spirited
without
vulgarity
a
breezy
wholesome
fellow
he
came
down
on
his
bicycle
and
would
return
in
the
same
way
louise
at
once
made
a
resolve
to
learn
cycling
wish
you
lived
at
sutton
bilton
i
should
ask
you
to
teach
me
really
very
sorry
that
i
do
replied
the
young
man
discreetly
never
mind
i
find
somebody
the
fourth
arrival
dunnill
was
older
and
less
affable
he
talked
chiefly
with
grove
a
very
quiet
somewhat
careworn
man
neither
of
them
seemed
able
to
shake
off
business
but
they
did
not
obtrude
it
on
the
company
in
general
the
day
passed
pleasantly
but
in
miss
derrick
opinion
rather
soberly
doing
her
best
to
fascinate
bilton
she
felt
a
slight
disappointment
at
her
inability
to
engross
his
attention
and
at
the
civil
friendliness
which
he
thought
a
sufficient
reply
to
her
gay
sallies
for
so
and
a
man
he
struck
her
as
singularly
reserved
but
perhaps
he
was
engaged
yes
that
must
be
the
explanation
when
the
guests
had
left
she
put
a
plain
question
to
mumford
do
he
is
engaged
answered
emmeline
who
on
the
whole
was
satisfied
with
miss
derrick
demeanour
throughout
the
day
but
of
course
he
be
without
you
knowing
it
or
is
it
always
made
known
no
rule
about
it
my
dear
they
very
nice
people
said
louise
with
a
little
sigh
i
like
your
sister
so
much
i
glad
she
asked
me
to
go
and
see
her
is
bilton
often
at
her
house
do
misunderstand
me
mumford
it
only
that
i
like
men
society
there
no
harm
is
there
and
people
like
bilton
are
very
different
from
those
i
known
and
i
want
to
see
more
of
them
you
know
no
harm
in
saying
that
to
louise
replied
mumford
pray
be
careful
not
to
seem
forward
people
think
and
say
such
disagreeable
things
miss
derrick
was
grateful
and
again
gave
an
assurance
that
repose
and
modesty
should
be
the
rule
of
her
life
at
the
theatre
on
monday
evening
she
exhibited
a
childlike
enjoyment
which
her
companions
could
not
but
envy
the
freshness
of
her
sensibilities
was
indeed
remarkable
and
emmeline
observed
with
pleasure
that
her
mind
seemed
to
have
a
very
wholesome
tone
louise
might
commit
follies
and
be
guilty
of
bad
taste
to
any
extent
but
nothing
in
her
savoured
of
depravity
tuesday
she
spent
at
home
pretending
to
read
a
little
and
obviously
thinking
a
great
deal
on
wednesday
morning
she
proposed
of
a
sudden
that
emmeline
should
go
up
to
town
with
her
on
a
shopping
expedition
they
had
already
turned
over
her
wardrobe
numerous
articles
whereof
were
condemned
by
mumford
taste
and
by
louise
cheerfully
sacrificed
she
could
not
rest
till
new
purchases
had
been
made
so
after
early
luncheon
they
took
train
to
victoria
louise
insisting
that
all
the
expenses
should
be
hers
by
five
she
had
laid
out
some
fifteen
pounds
vastly
to
her
satisfaction
they
took
tea
at
a
restaurant
and
reached
sutton
not
long
before
mumford
return
on
friday
they
went
to
london
again
to
call
upon
grove
louise
promised
that
this
should
be
her
last
outing
for
a
whole
week
she
admitted
a
feeling
of
restlessness
but
after
she
would
overcome
it
and
that
night
she
apologised
formally
to
mumford
for
taking
his
wife
so
much
from
home
do
think
i
shall
always
be
running
about
like
this
i
feel
that
i
settling
down
we
are
going
to
be
very
comfortable
and
quiet
and
to
the
surprise
of
her
friends
more
than
a
week
went
by
before
she
declared
that
a
day
in
town
was
absolutely
necessary
higgins
had
sent
her
a
fresh
supply
of
money
as
there
were
still
a
few
things
she
needed
to
purchase
but
this
time
emmeline
begged
her
to
go
alone
and
louise
seemed
quite
satisfied
with
the
arrangement
early
in
the
afternoon
as
mumford
was
making
ready
to
go
out
the
servant
announced
to
her
that
a
gentleman
had
called
to
see
miss
derrick
on
learning
that
miss
derrick
was
away
he
had
asked
sundry
questions
and
ended
by
requesting
an
interview
with
mumford
his
name
was
cobb
him
into
the
said
emmeline
a
trifle
agitated
will
be
down
in
a
few
moments
beset
by
anxious
anticipations
she
entered
the
room
and
saw
before
her
a
figure
not
wholly
unlike
what
she
had
imagined
a
wiry
man
with
knitted
brows
lips
and
heavy
feet
firmly
planted
on
the
carpet
he
was
respectably
dressed
but
nothing
more
and
in
his
large
bare
hands
held
a
brown
hat
marked
with
a
grease
spot
one
would
have
judged
him
a
skilled
mechanic
when
he
began
to
speak
his
blunt
but
civil
phrases
were
in
keeping
with
this
impression
he
had
not
the
tone
of
an
educated
man
yet
committed
no
vulgar
errors
name
is
cobb
i
must
beg
your
pardon
for
troubling
you
perhaps
you
have
heard
of
me
from
miss
derrick
cobb
your
name
has
been
mentioned
emmeline
replied
nervously
you
sit
down
you
i
will
he
twisted
his
hat
about
and
seemed
to
prepare
with
difficulty
the
next
remark
which
at
length
burst
rather
than
fell
from
his
lips
wanted
to
see
miss
derrick
i
suppose
she
is
still
living
with
you
they
told
me
so
a
terrible
man
thought
emmeline
when
roused
to
anger
his
words
must
descend
like
and
it
would
not
take
much
to
anger
him
for
all
that
he
had
by
no
means
a
truculent
countenance
he
was
trying
to
smile
and
his
features
softened
agreeably
enough
the
more
closely
she
observed
him
the
less
grew
emmeline
wonder
that
louise
felt
an
interest
in
the
man
derrick
is
likely
to
stay
with
us
for
some
time
i
believe
she
has
only
gone
to
town
to
do
some
shopping
see
when
i
met
her
last
she
talked
a
good
deal
about
you
mumford
and
that
why
i
thought
i
would
ask
to
see
you
you
have
a
good
deal
of
influence
over
her
you
think
so
returned
emmeline
not
displeased
hope
i
may
use
it
for
her
good
do
i
but
well
it
comes
to
this
mumford
she
seemed
to
hint
though
she
did
exactly
say
so
that
you
were
advising
her
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
me
of
course
you
do
know
me
and
i
no
doubt
you
do
what
you
think
the
best
for
her
i
should
feel
it
a
kindness
if
you
would
just
tell
me
whether
you
are
really
persuading
her
to
think
no
more
about
me
it
was
an
alarming
challenge
emmeline
fears
returned
she
half
expected
an
outbreak
of
violence
the
man
was
growing
very
nervous
and
his
muscles
showed
the
working
of
strong
emotion
have
given
her
no
such
advice
cobb
she
answered
with
an
attempt
at
calm
dignity
derrick
private
affairs
do
at
all
concern
me
in
such
matters
as
this
she
is
really
quite
old
enough
to
judge
for
herself
what
should
have
said
remarked
cobb
sturdily
hope
you
excuse
me
i
do
wish
to
make
myself
offensive
after
what
she
said
to
me
when
we
met
last
i
suppose
most
men
would
just
let
her
go
her
own
way
but
but
somehow
i
ca
do
that
the
thing
is
i
ca
trust
what
she
says
i
do
believe
she
knows
her
own
mind
and
so
long
as
you
tell
me
that
you
not
interfering
i
mean
that
you
do
think
it
right
to
set
her
against
me
assure
you
nothing
of
the
kind
there
was
a
brief
silence
then
cobb
voice
again
sounded
with
blunt
emphasis
neither
of
us
very
we
known
each
other
about
a
year
and
we
must
have
quarrelled
about
fifty
times
you
think
then
ventured
the
hostess
it
would
ever
be
possible
for
you
to
live
peacefully
together
i
do
was
the
robust
answer
would
be
a
fight
for
the
upper
hand
but
i
know
who
get
it
and
after
that
things
would
be
all
right
emmeline
could
not
restrain
a
laugh
and
her
visitor
joined
in
it
with
a
heartiness
which
spoke
in
his
favour
promise
you
cobb
that
i
will
do
nothing
whatever
against
your
interests
very
kind
of
you
and
it
all
i
wanted
to
know
he
stood
up
emmeline
still
doubtful
how
to
behave
asked
him
if
he
would
call
on
another
day
when
miss
derrick
might
be
at
home
only
by
chance
i
was
able
to
get
here
this
afternoon
he
replied
have
much
time
to
go
running
about
after
her
and
that
where
i
at
a
disadvantage
i
do
know
whether
anyone
else
and
i
not
asking
you
to
tell
me
if
you
know
of
course
i
have
to
take
my
chance
but
so
long
as
you
do
speak
against
me
and
she
thinks
a
great
deal
of
your
advice
very
glad
to
be
assured
of
that
all
i
shall
do
cobb
is
to
keep
before
her
mind
the
duty
of
behaving
straightforwardly
the
thing
nobody
can
ask
more
than
that
emmeline
hesitated
but
could
not
dismiss
him
without
shaking
hands
that
he
did
not
offer
to
do
so
until
invited
though
he
betrayed
no
sense
of
social
inferiority
seemed
another
point
in
his
favour
chapter
iv
not
half
an
hour
after
cobb
departure
louise
returned
emmeline
was
surprised
to
see
her
back
so
soon
they
met
near
the
railway
station
as
mumford
was
on
her
way
to
a
shop
in
high
street
it
good
of
me
if
i
had
stayed
longer
i
should
have
gone
home
to
quarrel
with
cissy
but
i
struggled
against
the
temptation
going
to
the
grocer
oh
do
let
me
go
with
you
and
see
how
you
do
that
kind
of
thing
i
never
gave
an
order
at
the
grocer
in
my
life
no
indeed
i
never
did
mother
and
cissy
have
always
looked
after
that
and
i
want
to
learn
about
housekeeping
you
promised
to
teach
me
emmeline
made
no
mention
of
cobb
call
until
they
reached
the
house
came
here
louise
exclaimed
reddening
impudence
i
shall
at
once
write
and
tell
him
that
his
behaviour
is
outrageous
am
i
to
be
hunted
like
this
her
wrath
seemed
genuine
enough
but
she
was
vehemently
eager
to
learn
all
that
had
passed
emmeline
made
a
truthful
report
quite
sure
that
was
all
oh
his
impertinence
well
and
now
that
you
seen
him
do
you
understand
how
how
impossible
it
is
shall
say
nothing
more
about
it
louise
it
is
my
business
to
the
girl
face
threatened
a
tempest
as
emmeline
was
moving
away
she
rudely
obstructed
her
insist
on
you
telling
me
what
you
think
it
was
abominable
of
him
to
come
when
i
was
at
home
and
i
do
think
you
ought
to
have
seen
him
you
no
right
to
keep
your
thoughts
to
yourself
mumford
was
offended
and
showed
it
have
a
perfect
right
and
i
shall
do
so
please
do
let
us
quarrel
you
may
be
fond
of
it
but
i
am
not
louise
went
from
the
room
and
remained
invisible
till
just
before
dinner
when
she
came
down
with
a
grave
and
rather
haughty
countenance
to
mumford
remarks
she
replied
with
curt
formality
he
prepared
for
this
state
of
things
began
conversing
cheerfully
with
his
wife
and
miss
derrick
kept
silence
after
dinner
she
passed
out
into
the
garden
wo
do
said
mumford
house
is
upset
i
afraid
we
shall
have
to
get
rid
of
her
she
ca
behave
herself
i
afraid
we
must
it
my
fault
i
ought
to
have
known
that
it
would
never
do
at
ten
louise
was
still
sitting
out
of
doors
in
the
dark
emmeline
wishing
to
lock
up
for
the
night
went
to
summon
her
troublesome
guest
you
better
come
in
but
i
think
you
are
very
unkind
mrs
mumford
derrick
i
really
ca
do
anything
but
leave
you
alone
when
you
are
in
such
an
unpleasant
hum
our
that
just
what
you
to
do
when
i
left
alone
i
sulk
and
that
bad
for
all
of
us
if
you
would
just
get
angry
and
give
me
what
i
deserve
it
would
be
all
over
very
soon
are
always
talking
about
nice
people
nice
people
do
have
scenes
of
that
kind
i
suppose
not
and
i
very
sorry
and
if
you
let
me
beg
your
pardon
there
and
we
might
have
made
it
up
hours
ago
i
wo
ask
you
to
tell
me
what
you
think
of
cobb
i
written
him
the
kind
of
letter
his
impudence
deserves
well
we
wo
talk
of
it
any
more
and
if
you
be
a
little
quieter
in
your
manners
louise
will
i
promise
i
will
let
me
say
to
mr
mumford
for
a
day
or
two
there
was
halcyon
weather
on
saturday
afternoon
louise
hired
a
carriage
and
took
her
friends
for
a
drive
into
the
country
at
her
special
request
the
child
accompanied
them
nothing
could
have
been
more
delightful
she
had
quite
made
up
her
mind
to
have
a
house
some
day
at
sutton
she
hoped
the
mumfords
would
always
live
there
that
they
might
perpetually
enjoy
each
society
what
were
the
rents
she
inquired
well
to
begin
with
she
would
be
content
with
one
of
the
smaller
houses
a
modest
semidetached
little
place
like
those
at
the
far
end
of
cedar
road
they
were
perfectly
respectable
were
they
not
how
this
change
in
her
station
was
to
come
about
louise
offered
no
hint
and
did
not
seem
to
think
of
the
matter
then
restlessness
again
came
upon
her
one
day
she
all
but
declared
her
disappointment
that
the
mumfords
saw
so
few
people
emmeline
repeating
this
to
her
husband
avowed
a
certain
compunction
almost
feel
that
i
deliberately
misled
her
you
know
clarence
in
our
first
conversation
i
mentioned
the
kirby
simpsons
and
hollings
and
i
feel
sure
she
remembers
it
would
be
nice
to
be
taking
her
money
on
false
pretences
would
it
do
trouble
it
quite
certain
she
has
someone
in
mind
whom
she
means
to
marry
before
long
ca
help
thinking
that
but
i
do
know
who
it
can
be
she
had
a
letter
this
morning
in
a
man
writing
and
did
speak
of
it
it
was
mr
cobb
louise
next
day
put
a
question
you
say
that
you
knew
some
people
at
west
kensington
yes
answered
emmeline
carelessly
kirby
simpsons
they
away
from
home
sorry
for
that
is
there
anyone
else
we
could
go
and
see
or
ask
over
here
think
it
very
likely
bilton
will
come
down
in
a
few
days
louise
received
bilton
name
with
moderate
interest
but
she
dropped
the
subject
and
seemed
to
reconcile
herself
to
domestic
pleasures
it
was
on
the
evening
of
this
day
that
emmeline
received
a
letter
which
gave
her
much
annoyance
her
sister
grove
wrote
thus
news
does
get
about
and
what
ridiculous
forms
it
takes
here
is
powell
writing
to
me
from
birmingham
and
she
says
she
has
heard
that
you
have
taken
in
the
daughter
of
some
wealthy
for
a
consideration
to
train
her
in
the
ways
of
decent
society
just
the
kind
of
thing
powell
would
delight
in
talking
about
she
is
so
very
malicious
where
she
got
her
information
i
imagine
she
does
give
the
slightest
hint
they
tell
me
i
copy
her
words
that
the
girl
is
all
but
a
savage
and
does
and
says
the
most
awful
things
i
quite
admire
mumford
courage
i
heard
of
people
doing
this
kind
of
thing
and
i
always
wondered
how
they
got
on
with
their
friends
of
course
i
have
written
to
contradict
this
rubbish
but
it
very
annoying
i
sure
mumford
was
angry
the
source
of
these
fables
must
be
either
bilton
or
dunnill
yet
he
had
not
thought
either
of
them
the
kind
of
men
to
make
mischief
who
else
knew
anything
of
the
affair
searching
her
memory
emmeline
recalled
a
person
unknown
to
her
a
married
lady
who
had
dropped
in
at
grove
when
she
and
louise
were
there
did
like
her
a
supercilious
sort
of
person
and
she
talked
a
great
deal
of
her
acquaintance
with
important
people
it
far
more
likely
to
have
come
from
her
than
from
either
of
those
men
i
shall
write
and
tell
molly
so
they
began
to
feel
uncomfortable
and
seriously
thought
of
getting
rid
of
the
burden
so
imprudently
undertaken
louise
the
next
day
wanted
to
take
emmeline
to
town
and
showed
dissatisfaction
when
she
had
to
go
unaccompanied
she
stayed
till
late
in
the
evening
and
came
back
with
a
gay
account
of
her
calls
upon
two
or
three
old
friends
the
girls
of
whom
she
had
spoken
to
mumford
one
of
them
miss
featherstone
she
had
taken
to
dine
with
her
at
a
restaurant
and
afterwards
they
had
spent
an
hour
or
two
at
miss
featherstone
lodgings
did
go
near
tulse
hill
and
if
you
knew
how
i
am
wondering
what
is
going
on
there
not
a
line
from
anyone
i
shall
write
to
mother
emmeline
produced
a
letter
which
had
arrived
for
miss
derrick
did
you
give
it
me
before
louise
exclaimed
impatiently
dear
you
had
so
much
to
tell
me
i
waited
for
the
first
pause
is
from
home
said
the
girl
after
a
glance
at
the
envelope
nothing
after
saying
she
called
to
emmeline
from
her
bedroom
door
entering
the
room
mumford
saw
the
open
letter
in
louise
hand
and
read
in
her
face
a
desire
of
confession
want
to
tell
you
something
do
be
in
a
hurry
just
a
few
minutes
this
letter
is
from
mr
bowling
yes
and
i
had
one
from
him
before
and
i
was
obliged
to
answer
it
you
mean
they
are
i
afraid
they
are
and
it
so
stupid
and
i
so
vexed
i
do
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
him
as
i
told
you
long
ago
louise
often
used
expressions
which
to
a
stranger
would
have
implied
that
her
intimacy
with
mumford
was
of
years
standing
wrote
for
the
first
time
last
week
such
a
silly
letter
i
wish
you
would
read
it
well
he
said
that
it
was
all
over
between
him
and
cissy
and
that
he
cared
only
for
me
and
always
had
and
always
would
you
know
how
men
write
he
said
he
considered
himself
quite
free
cissy
had
refused
him
and
was
that
enough
now
that
i
was
away
from
home
he
could
write
to
me
and
would
i
let
him
see
me
of
course
i
wrote
that
i
did
to
see
him
and
i
thought
he
was
behaving
very
badly
though
i
do
really
think
so
because
it
all
that
idiot
cissy
fault
did
i
do
quite
right
think
so
well
and
now
he
writing
again
you
see
oh
such
a
lot
of
rubbish
i
can
hear
him
saying
it
all
through
his
nose
do
tell
me
what
i
ought
to
do
next
must
either
pay
no
attention
to
the
letter
or
reply
so
that
he
ca
possibly
misunderstand
you
him
names
you
mean
dear
louise
that
the
only
way
with
such
men
i
suppose
you
never
were
bothered
with
them
i
think
i
better
not
write
at
all
emmeline
approved
this
course
and
soon
left
miss
derrick
to
her
reflections
the
next
day
louise
carried
out
her
resolve
to
write
for
information
regarding
the
progress
of
things
at
coburg
lodge
she
had
not
long
to
wait
for
a
reply
and
it
was
of
so
startling
a
nature
that
she
ran
at
once
to
mumford
whom
she
found
in
the
nursery
please
come
down
here
something
i
must
tell
you
about
what
do
you
think
mother
says
i
to
go
back
home
again
at
once
the
reason
emmeline
inquired
knowing
not
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
read
it
to
you
dear
lou
she
says
you
made
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
i
hope
you
satisfied
things
are
all
upside
down
and
i
never
seen
dada
that
higgins
of
course
never
seen
dada
in
such
a
bad
temper
not
since
first
i
knew
him
mr
b
that
mr
bowling
you
know
has
told
him
plain
that
he
does
think
any
more
of
cissy
and
that
nothing
must
be
expected
of
him
oh
what
sweet
letters
mother
does
write
that
was
when
dada
went
and
asked
him
about
his
intentions
as
he
could
help
doing
because
cissy
is
fretting
so
it
all
over
and
of
course
you
the
cause
of
it
and
though
i
ca
blame
you
as
much
as
the
others
do
i
think
you
to
blame
and
cissy
said
she
must
go
to
the
seaside
to
get
over
it
and
she
went
off
yesterday
to
margate
to
your
aunt
annie
and
there
she
says
she
shall
stay
as
long
as
she
does
feel
quite
well
and
dada
has
to
pay
two
guineas
a
week
for
her
so
he
says
at
once
loo
have
to
come
back
i
not
going
to
pay
for
the
both
of
them
boarding
out
he
says
and
he
means
it
he
has
told
me
to
write
to
you
at
once
and
you
to
come
as
soon
as
you
can
and
he
wo
be
responsible
to
mumford
for
more
than
another
there
but
i
sha
go
for
all
that
the
idea
i
left
home
just
to
please
them
and
now
i
to
go
back
just
when
it
suits
their
convenience
certainly
not
what
will
you
do
louise
asked
mumford
higgins
is
quite
determined
oh
i
shall
settle
it
easy
enough
i
shall
write
at
once
to
the
old
man
and
tell
him
i
getting
on
so
nicely
in
every
way
that
i
could
dream
of
leaving
you
it
all
nonsense
you
see
emmeline
and
her
husband
held
a
council
that
night
and
resolved
that
whatever
the
issue
of
louise
appeal
to
her
stepfather
this
was
a
very
good
opportunity
for
getting
rid
of
their
guest
they
would
wait
till
louise
made
known
the
upshot
of
her
negotiations
it
seemed
probable
that
higgins
would
spare
them
the
unpleasantness
of
telling
miss
derrick
she
must
leave
if
not
that
disagreeable
necessity
must
be
faced
had
rather
cut
down
expenses
all
round
said
emmeline
have
our
home
upset
in
this
way
it
is
like
home
at
all
louise
is
a
whirlwind
and
the
longer
she
stays
the
worse
it
be
it
wo
do
at
all
mumford
assented
the
bye
i
met
bilton
and
he
asked
after
miss
derrick
i
did
like
his
look
or
his
tone
at
all
i
feel
quite
sure
there
a
joke
going
round
at
our
expense
confound
it
mind
it
be
over
in
a
day
or
two
and
it
be
a
lesson
to
you
clarence
wo
it
quite
admit
that
the
idea
was
mine
her
husband
replied
rather
irritably
it
was
i
who
accepted
the
girl
as
a
suitable
person
certainly
it
was
rejoined
emmeline
will
please
to
remember
that
i
said
again
and
again
hang
it
emmy
we
made
a
blunder
both
of
us
and
do
let
us
make
it
worse
by
wrangling
about
it
there
you
are
people
of
that
class
bring
infection
into
the
house
if
she
stayed
here
a
twelvemonth
we
should
have
got
to
throwing
things
at
each
other
the
answer
to
louise
letter
of
remonstrance
came
in
the
form
of
higgins
herself
shortly
before
luncheon
that
lady
drove
up
to
runnymede
in
a
cab
and
her
daughter
who
had
just
returned
from
a
walk
was
startled
to
hear
of
the
arrival
got
to
come
home
with
me
lou
higgins
began
as
she
wiped
her
perspiring
face
promised
to
have
you
back
by
this
afternoon
dada
right
down
angry
you
would
know
him
he
blames
everything
on
to
you
and
you
better
just
come
home
quiet
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
answered
louise
her
temper
rising
higgins
glared
at
her
and
began
to
rail
the
voice
was
painfully
audible
to
emmeline
who
just
then
passed
through
the
hall
miss
derrick
gave
as
good
as
she
received
a
battle
raged
for
some
minutes
differing
from
many
a
former
conflict
only
in
the
moderation
of
pitch
and
vocabulary
due
to
their
being
in
a
stranger
house
you
wo
come
cried
the
mother
at
length
had
my
journey
for
nothing
have
i
then
just
go
and
fetch
she
must
hear
what
i
got
to
say
mumford
is
at
home
answered
louise
with
bold
mendacity
a
very
good
thing
too
i
should
be
sorry
for
her
to
see
you
in
the
state
you
in
in
no
more
of
a
state
than
you
are
louise
and
just
you
listen
to
this
not
one
farthing
more
will
you
have
from
not
one
farthing
and
you
may
think
yourself
lucky
if
you
still
a
for
all
i
know
you
have
to
earn
your
own
living
and
like
to
hear
how
you
mean
to
do
it
as
soon
as
i
get
back
i
shall
write
to
and
tell
her
that
nothing
will
be
paid
for
you
after
the
week
that
due
and
the
week
that
for
notice
now
just
take
heed
of
what
you
doing
lou
it
may
have
more
serious
results
than
you
think
for
thought
all
i
going
to
think
replied
the
girl
shall
stay
here
as
long
as
i
like
and
be
indebted
neither
to
you
nor
to
stepfather
mumford
breathed
a
sigh
of
thankfulness
that
she
was
not
called
upon
to
take
part
in
this
scene
it
was
bad
enough
that
the
servant
engaged
in
laying
lunch
could
hear
distinctly
higgins
coarse
and
violent
onslaught
when
the
front
door
at
length
closed
she
rejoiced
but
with
trembling
for
the
words
that
fell
upon
her
ear
from
the
hall
announced
too
plainly
that
louise
was
determined
to
stay
chapter
v
miss
derrick
had
gone
back
into
the
and
to
surprise
remained
there
this
retirement
was
ominous
the
girl
must
be
taking
some
resolve
emmeline
on
her
part
braced
her
courage
for
the
step
on
which
she
had
decided
luncheon
awaited
them
but
it
would
be
much
better
to
arrive
at
an
understanding
before
they
sat
down
to
the
meal
she
entered
the
room
and
found
louise
leaning
on
the
back
of
a
chair
dare
say
you
heard
the
row
miss
derrick
remarked
coldly
very
sorry
but
nothing
of
that
kind
shall
happen
again
her
countenance
was
disturbed
she
seemed
to
be
putting
a
restraint
upon
herself
and
only
with
great
effort
to
subdue
her
voice
are
you
going
to
do
asked
emmeline
in
a
friendly
tone
but
as
it
were
from
a
distance
am
going
to
ask
you
to
do
me
a
great
kindness
mrs
mumford
there
was
no
reply
the
girl
paused
a
moment
then
resumed
impulsively
higgins
says
that
if
i
do
come
home
he
wo
let
me
have
any
more
money
they
going
to
write
and
tell
you
that
they
be
responsible
after
this
for
my
board
and
lodging
of
course
i
shall
not
go
home
i
should
dream
of
it
i
rather
earn
my
living
as
as
a
scullery
maid
i
want
to
ask
you
mumford
whether
you
will
let
me
stay
on
and
trust
me
to
pay
what
i
owe
you
it
wo
be
for
very
long
and
i
promise
you
i
pay
every
penny
the
natural
impulse
of
emmeline
disposition
was
to
reply
with
hospitable
kindliness
she
found
it
very
difficult
to
maintain
her
purpose
it
shamed
her
to
behave
like
the
ordinary
landlady
to
appear
actuated
by
mean
motives
but
the
domestic
strain
was
growing
intolerable
and
she
felt
sure
that
clarence
would
be
exasperated
if
her
weakness
prolonged
it
do
let
me
advise
you
louise
she
answered
gently
you
acting
wisely
would
it
be
very
much
better
to
go
home
louise
lost
all
her
flushed
with
anger
her
eyes
glaring
she
broke
into
vehement
exclamations
want
to
get
rid
of
me
very
well
i
go
this
moment
i
was
going
to
tell
you
something
but
you
do
care
what
becomes
of
me
i
send
for
my
luggage
you
sha
be
troubled
with
it
long
and
you
be
paid
all
that
owing
i
did
think
you
were
one
of
that
kind
i
go
this
minute
as
you
please
said
emmeline
temper
is
really
so
very
i
know
it
always
my
temper
and
nobody
else
is
ever
to
blame
i
would
stay
another
night
in
the
house
if
i
had
to
sleep
on
the
downs
she
flung
out
of
the
room
and
flew
upstairs
emmeline
angered
by
this
unwarrantable
treatment
determined
to
hold
aloof
and
let
the
girl
do
as
she
would
miss
derrick
was
of
full
age
and
quite
capable
of
taking
care
of
herself
or
at
all
events
ought
to
be
perhaps
this
was
the
only
possible
issue
of
the
difficulties
in
which
they
had
all
become
involved
neither
louise
nor
her
parents
could
be
dealt
with
in
the
rational
peaceful
way
preferred
by
people
to
get
her
out
of
the
house
was
the
main
point
if
she
chose
to
depart
in
a
whirlwind
that
was
her
own
affair
all
but
certainly
she
would
go
home
if
not
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
her
step
sounded
on
the
stairs
would
she
turn
into
the
where
emmeline
now
sat
at
table
no
straight
through
the
hall
and
out
at
the
front
door
which
closed
however
quite
softly
behind
her
that
she
did
not
slam
it
seemed
wonderful
to
emmeline
the
girl
was
not
wholly
a
savage
presently
mumford
went
up
to
inspect
the
forsaken
chamber
louise
had
packed
all
her
things
of
course
she
must
have
tumbled
them
recklessly
into
the
trunks
drawers
were
left
open
as
if
to
exhibit
their
emptiness
but
in
other
respects
the
room
looked
tidy
enough
neatness
and
order
came
by
no
means
naturally
to
miss
derrick
and
emmeline
did
not
know
what
pains
the
girl
had
taken
ever
since
her
arrival
to
live
in
conformity
with
the
habits
of
a
household
louise
meanwhile
had
gone
to
the
railway
station
intending
to
take
a
ticket
for
victoria
but
half
an
hour
must
elapse
before
the
arrival
of
a
train
and
she
walked
about
in
an
irresolute
mood
for
one
thing
she
felt
hungry
at
sutton
her
appetite
had
been
keen
and
were
always
welcome
she
entered
the
refreshment
room
and
with
inward
murmurs
made
a
repast
which
reminded
her
of
the
excellent
luncheon
she
might
now
have
been
enjoying
all
the
time
she
pondered
her
situation
ultimately
instead
of
booking
for
victoria
she
procured
a
ticket
for
epsom
downs
and
had
not
long
to
wait
for
the
train
it
was
a
hot
day
at
the
end
of
june
wafts
of
breezy
coolness
passed
now
and
then
over
the
high
open
country
but
did
not
suffice
to
combat
the
sun
steady
glare
after
walking
half
a
mile
or
so
absorbed
in
thought
louise
suffered
so
much
that
she
looked
about
for
shadow
before
her
was
the
towering
ugliness
of
the
grand
stand
this
she
had
seen
and
admired
when
driving
past
it
with
her
friends
it
did
not
now
attract
her
in
another
direction
the
downs
were
edged
with
trees
and
that
way
she
turned
all
but
overcome
with
heat
and
weariness
she
at
length
found
a
shaded
spot
where
her
solitude
seemed
secure
and
after
seating
herself
the
first
thing
she
did
was
to
have
a
good
cry
then
for
an
hour
she
sat
thinking
and
as
she
thought
her
face
gradually
emerged
from
gloom
the
better
truer
face
which
so
often
allowed
itself
to
be
disguised
at
the
prompting
of
an
evil
spirit
her
softening
lips
all
but
smiled
as
if
at
an
amusing
suggestion
and
her
eyes
in
their
reverie
seemed
to
behold
a
pleasant
promise
unconsciously
she
plucked
and
tasted
the
sweet
stems
of
grass
that
grew
about
her
at
length
the
sun
movements
having
robbed
her
of
shadow
she
rose
looked
at
her
watch
and
glanced
around
for
another
retreat
hard
by
was
a
little
wood
delightfully
grassy
and
cool
fenced
about
with
railings
she
could
easily
have
climbed
but
a
severely
admonishing
trespassers
forbade
the
attempt
with
a
petulant
remark
to
herself
on
the
selfishness
of
those
people
she
sauntered
past
along
this
edge
of
the
downs
stands
a
picturesque
row
of
stunted
bittered
and
twisted
through
many
a
winter
by
the
upland
gales
louise
noticed
them
only
to
think
for
a
moment
what
ugly
trees
they
were
before
her
east
west
and
north
lay
the
wooded
landscape
soft
of
hue
beneath
the
summer
sky
spreading
its
tranquil
beauty
far
away
to
the
mists
of
the
horizon
in
vivacious
company
she
would
have
called
it
and
perhaps
have
thought
it
a
charming
view
alone
she
had
no
eye
for
such
things
an
indifference
characteristic
of
her
mind
and
not
at
all
dependent
upon
its
mood
presently
another
patch
of
shade
invited
her
to
repose
again
and
again
she
meditated
for
an
hour
or
more
the
sun
had
grown
less
ardent
and
a
breeze
no
longer
fitful
made
walking
pleasant
the
sight
of
who
in
their
ribboned
hats
and
white
pinafores
were
having
tea
not
far
away
suggested
to
louise
that
she
also
would
like
such
refreshment
doubtless
it
might
be
procured
at
the
inn
yonder
near
the
racecourse
and
thither
she
began
to
move
her
thoughts
were
more
at
rest
she
had
made
her
plan
for
the
evening
all
that
had
to
be
done
was
to
kill
time
for
another
hour
or
so
walking
lightly
over
the
turf
she
noticed
the
chalk
marks
significant
of
golf
and
wondered
how
the
game
was
played
without
difficulty
she
obtained
her
cup
of
tea
loitered
over
it
as
long
as
possible
strayed
yet
awhile
about
the
downs
and
towards
six
made
for
the
railway
station
she
travelled
no
further
than
sutton
and
there
lingered
in
the
waiting
room
till
the
arrival
of
a
certain
train
from
london
bridge
as
the
train
came
in
she
took
up
a
position
near
the
exit
among
the
people
who
had
alighted
her
eye
soon
perceived
clarence
mumford
she
stepped
up
to
him
and
drew
his
attention
have
you
come
by
the
same
train
he
asked
shaking
hands
with
her
i
been
waiting
here
because
i
wanted
to
see
you
mumford
will
you
spare
me
a
minute
or
two
in
the
station
if
you
do
mind
astonished
mumford
drew
aside
with
her
to
a
quiet
part
of
the
long
platform
louise
keeping
a
very
grave
countenance
told
him
rapidly
all
that
had
befallen
since
his
departure
from
home
in
the
morning
behaved
horridly
and
i
was
sorry
for
it
as
soon
as
i
had
left
the
house
after
all
mumford
kindness
to
me
and
yours
i
do
know
how
i
could
be
so
horrid
but
the
quarrel
with
mother
had
upset
me
so
and
i
felt
so
miserable
when
mumford
seemed
to
want
to
get
rid
of
me
i
feel
sure
she
did
really
want
to
send
me
away
she
was
only
advising
me
as
she
thought
for
my
good
but
i
ca
and
wo
go
home
and
i
been
waiting
all
the
afternoon
to
see
you
no
not
here
i
went
to
epsom
downs
and
walked
about
and
then
came
back
just
in
time
and
do
you
think
i
might
go
back
i
do
mean
now
at
once
but
this
evening
after
you
had
dinner
i
really
do
know
where
to
go
for
the
night
and
it
such
a
stupid
position
to
be
in
is
it
with
perfect
naivete
or
with
perfect
simulation
of
it
she
looked
him
in
the
face
and
it
was
mumford
who
had
to
avert
his
eyes
the
young
man
felt
very
uncomfortable
i
quite
sure
emmy
will
be
glad
to
let
you
come
for
the
night
miss
derrick
but
mumford
i
want
to
stay
longer
a
few
weeks
longer
do
you
think
mumford
would
forgive
me
i
have
made
up
my
mind
what
to
do
and
i
ought
to
have
told
her
i
should
have
if
i
lost
my
temper
replied
the
other
in
grave
embarrassment
but
feeling
that
he
had
no
alternative
us
go
to
the
house
i
could
i
should
like
anyone
to
know
that
i
spoke
to
you
about
it
it
would
be
nice
would
it
i
thought
if
i
came
later
after
dinner
and
perhaps
you
could
talk
to
mumford
and
and
prepare
her
i
mean
perhaps
you
would
mind
saying
you
were
sorry
i
had
gone
so
suddenly
and
then
perhaps
mumford
she
so
kind
would
say
that
she
was
sorry
too
and
then
i
might
come
into
the
garden
and
find
you
both
sitting
there
mumford
despite
his
most
uneasy
frame
of
mind
betrayed
a
passing
amusement
he
looked
into
the
girl
face
and
saw
its
prettiness
flush
with
pretty
confusion
and
this
did
not
tend
to
restore
his
tranquillity
shall
you
do
in
the
meantime
go
into
the
town
and
have
something
to
eat
and
then
walk
about
must
be
dreadfully
tired
already
a
little
but
i
do
mind
it
serves
me
right
i
shall
be
so
grateful
to
you
mumford
if
you
wo
let
me
come
i
suppose
i
must
go
to
london
and
ask
one
of
my
friends
to
take
me
in
will
arrange
it
come
about
eight
we
shall
be
in
the
garden
by
then
avoiding
her
look
he
moved
away
and
ran
up
the
stairs
but
from
the
exit
of
the
station
he
walked
slowly
in
part
to
calm
himself
to
assume
his
ordinary
appearance
and
in
part
to
think
over
the
comedy
he
was
going
to
play
emmeline
met
him
at
the
door
herself
too
much
flurried
to
notice
anything
peculiar
in
her
husband
aspect
she
repeated
the
story
with
which
he
was
already
acquainted
really
after
all
i
am
so
glad
was
her
conclusion
think
she
had
really
gone
all
the
afternoon
i
been
expecting
to
see
her
back
again
but
she
wo
come
now
and
it
is
a
good
thing
to
have
done
with
the
wretched
business
i
only
hope
she
will
tell
the
truth
to
her
people
she
might
say
that
we
turned
her
out
of
the
house
but
i
do
think
so
in
spite
of
all
her
faults
she
never
seemed
deceitful
or
malicious
mumford
was
strongly
tempted
to
reveal
what
had
happened
at
the
station
but
he
saw
danger
alike
in
disclosure
and
in
reticence
when
there
enters
the
slightest
possibility
of
jealousy
a
man
can
never
be
sure
that
his
wife
will
act
as
a
rational
being
he
feared
to
tell
the
simple
truth
lest
emmeline
should
not
believe
his
innocence
of
previous
plotting
with
miss
derrick
or
at
all
events
should
be
irritated
by
the
circumstances
into
refusing
louise
a
lodging
for
the
night
and
with
no
less
apprehension
he
decided
at
length
to
keep
the
secret
which
might
so
easily
become
known
hereafter
and
would
then
have
such
disagreeable
consequences
let
us
have
dinner
emmy
i
hungry
yes
it
a
good
thing
she
has
gone
but
i
wish
it
had
happened
in
that
way
what
a
spitfire
she
is
never
never
saw
the
like
and
if
you
had
heard
higgins
oh
what
dreadful
people
clarence
hear
me
register
a
vow
was
my
fault
dear
i
awfully
sorry
i
got
you
in
for
such
horrors
it
was
wholly
and
entirely
my
fault
by
due
insistence
on
this
mumford
of
course
put
his
wife
into
an
excellent
humour
and
after
they
had
dined
she
returned
to
her
regret
that
the
girl
should
have
gone
so
suddenly
clarence
declaring
that
he
would
allow
himself
a
cigar
instead
of
the
usual
pipe
to
celebrate
the
restoration
of
domestic
peace
soon
led
emmeline
into
the
garden
how
hot
it
has
been
in
our
office
at
noon
fellows
are
discarding
waistcoats
and
wearing
what
they
call
a
cummerbund
silk
sash
round
the
waist
i
think
i
must
follow
the
fashion
how
should
i
look
do
you
think
do
really
mind
that
we
lose
the
money
emmeline
asked
presently
we
shall
do
well
who
that
someone
was
entering
the
garden
by
the
side
path
and
in
a
moment
there
remained
no
doubt
who
the
person
was
louise
came
forward
her
head
bent
her
features
eloquent
of
fatigue
and
distress
mumford
i
could
without
asking
you
to
forgive
me
her
voice
broke
with
a
sob
she
stood
in
a
humble
attitude
and
emmeline
though
pierced
with
vexation
had
no
choice
but
to
hold
out
a
welcoming
hand
you
come
all
the
way
back
from
london
just
to
say
this
have
been
to
london
i
walked
about
all
day
and
oh
so
tired
and
miserable
will
you
let
me
stay
just
for
i
shall
be
so
grateful
course
you
may
stay
miss
derrick
it
was
very
far
from
my
wish
to
see
you
go
off
at
a
moment
notice
but
i
really
could
stop
you
mumford
had
stepped
aside
out
of
hearing
he
forgot
his
private
embarrassment
in
speculation
as
to
the
young
woman
character
that
she
was
acting
distress
and
penitence
he
could
hardly
believe
indeed
there
was
no
necessity
to
accuse
her
of
dishonest
behaviour
the
trivial
concealment
between
him
and
her
amounted
to
nothing
did
not
alter
the
facts
of
the
situation
but
what
could
be
at
the
root
of
her
seemingly
so
foolish
existence
emmeline
held
to
the
view
that
she
was
in
love
with
the
man
cobb
though
perhaps
unwilling
to
admit
it
even
in
her
own
silly
mind
it
might
be
so
and
so
it
made
her
more
interesting
for
one
was
tempted
to
think
that
louise
had
not
the
power
of
loving
at
all
yet
for
his
own
part
he
could
help
liking
her
the
eyes
that
had
looked
into
his
at
the
station
haunted
him
a
little
and
would
not
let
him
think
of
her
contemptuously
but
what
a
woman
to
make
ones
wife
unless
unless
louise
had
gone
into
the
house
emmeline
approached
her
husband
i
foresaw
it
is
vexing
mind
dear
she
go
to
morrow
or
the
day
after
wish
i
could
be
sure
of
that
chapter
vi
louise
did
not
appear
again
that
evening
thoroughly
tired
she
unpacked
her
trunks
sat
awhile
by
the
open
window
listening
to
a
piano
in
a
neighbouring
house
and
then
jumped
into
bed
from
ten
to
eight
next
morning
she
slept
soundly
at
breakfast
her
behaviour
was
marked
with
excessive
decorum
to
the
ordinary
civilities
of
her
host
and
hostess
she
replied
softly
modestly
in
the
manner
of
a
very
young
and
timid
girl
save
when
addressed
she
kept
silence
and
sat
with
head
inclined
a
virginal
freshness
breathed
about
her
she
ate
very
little
and
that
without
her
usual
gusto
but
rather
as
if
performing
a
dainty
ceremony
her
eyes
never
moved
in
mumford
direction
the
threatened
letter
from
higgins
had
arrived
emmeline
and
her
husband
read
it
before
their
guest
came
down
if
louise
continued
to
reside
with
them
they
entertained
her
with
a
full
knowledge
that
no
payment
must
be
expected
from
coburg
lodge
emmeline
awaited
the
disclosure
of
her
guest
project
which
had
more
than
once
been
alluded
to
yesterday
she
could
not
dream
of
permitting
louise
to
stay
for
more
than
a
day
or
two
whatever
the
suggestion
offered
this
morning
she
had
again
heard
from
her
sister
grove
who
was
strongly
of
opinion
that
miss
derrick
should
be
sent
back
to
her
native
sphere
shall
always
feel
she
said
to
her
husband
we
have
behaved
badly
i
was
guilty
of
false
pretences
fortunately
we
have
the
excuse
of
her
unbearable
temper
but
for
that
i
should
feel
dreadfully
ashamed
of
myself
very
soon
after
mumford
departure
louise
begged
for
a
few
minutes
private
talk
time
i
come
into
this
mumford
i
think
how
pretty
it
is
what
pains
you
must
have
taken
in
furnishing
it
i
never
saw
such
nice
curtains
anywhere
else
and
that
little
screen
i
so
fond
of
that
screen
was
a
wedding
present
from
an
old
friend
emmeline
replied
complacently
regarding
the
object
which
shone
with
embroidery
of
many
colours
you
help
me
when
furnish
louise
asked
sweetly
and
she
added
with
a
direct
look
do
think
it
will
be
very
long
am
going
to
marry
mr
bowling
emmeline
could
no
longer
feel
astonishment
at
anything
her
guest
said
or
did
the
tone
the
air
with
which
louise
made
this
declaration
affected
her
with
a
sense
of
something
quite
unforeseen
but
at
the
same
time
she
asked
herself
why
she
had
not
foreseen
it
was
not
this
the
obvious
answer
to
the
riddle
all
along
louise
had
wished
to
marry
mr
bowling
she
might
or
might
not
have
consciously
helped
to
bring
about
the
rupture
between
mr
bowling
and
miss
higgins
she
might
or
might
not
have
felt
genuinely
reluctant
to
take
advantage
of
her
defeat
but
a
struggle
had
been
going
on
in
the
girl
conscience
at
all
events
yes
this
explained
everything
and
on
the
whole
it
seemed
to
speak
in
louise
favour
her
ridicule
of
mr
bowling
person
and
character
became
in
this
new
light
a
proof
of
desire
to
resist
her
inclinations
she
had
only
yielded
when
it
was
certain
that
miss
higgins
former
lover
had
quite
thrown
off
his
old
allegiance
and
when
no
good
could
be
done
by
did
you
make
up
your
mind
to
this
louise
after
our
horrid
quarrel
no
did
quarrel
it
was
all
my
abominable
temper
this
morning
i
going
to
answer
mr
bowling
last
letter
and
i
shall
tell
him
what
i
told
you
he
be
delighted
you
have
really
wished
for
this
from
the
first
louise
plucked
at
the
fringe
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
and
replied
at
length
with
maidenly
frankness
always
thought
it
would
be
a
good
marriage
for
me
but
i
never
do
believe
me
i
never
tried
to
cut
cissy
out
the
truth
is
i
thought
a
good
deal
of
the
other
of
cobb
but
i
knew
that
i
marry
him
it
would
be
dreadful
we
should
quarrel
frightfully
and
he
would
kill
me
i
feel
sure
he
would
he
so
violent
in
his
temper
but
mr
bowling
is
very
nice
he
could
get
angry
if
he
tried
and
he
has
a
much
better
position
than
mr
cobb
emmeline
began
to
waver
in
her
conviction
and
to
feel
a
natural
annoyance
you
think
she
said
coldly
your
marriage
will
take
place
soon
what
i
want
to
speak
about
dear
mumford
did
you
hear
from
my
mother
this
morning
then
you
see
what
my
position
is
i
am
homeless
if
i
leave
you
i
do
know
where
i
shall
go
when
higgins
knows
i
going
to
marry
mr
bowling
he
wo
have
me
in
the
house
even
if
i
wanted
to
go
back
cissy
will
be
furious
she
come
back
from
margate
just
to
keep
up
her
father
anger
against
me
if
you
could
let
me
stay
here
just
a
short
time
mumford
just
a
few
weeks
i
should
like
to
be
married
from
your
house
the
listener
trembled
with
irritation
and
before
she
could
command
her
voice
louise
added
eagerly
course
when
we
married
mr
bowling
will
pay
all
my
debts
are
quite
mistaken
said
emmeline
distantly
you
think
that
the
money
matter
has
anything
to
do
with
with
my
unreadiness
to
agree
i
did
think
it
not
for
a
moment
i
a
trouble
to
you
i
know
i
am
but
i
be
so
quiet
dear
mumford
you
shall
hardly
know
i
in
the
house
if
once
it
all
settled
i
shall
be
out
of
temper
do
please
let
me
stay
i
like
you
so
much
and
how
wretched
it
would
be
if
i
had
to
be
married
from
a
afraid
louise
i
really
afraid
my
temper
the
girl
interrupted
ever
i
say
an
angry
word
you
shall
turn
me
out
that
very
moment
dear
mumford
oh
shall
i
do
if
you
wo
be
kind
to
me
what
will
become
of
me
i
have
no
home
and
everybody
hates
me
streamed
down
her
face
she
lay
back
overcome
with
misery
emmeline
was
distracted
she
felt
herself
powerless
to
act
as
dictated
yet
desired
more
than
ever
to
rid
herself
of
every
shadow
of
responsibility
for
the
girl
proceedings
the
idea
of
this
marriage
taking
place
at
runnymede
made
her
blood
run
cold
no
no
was
absolutely
out
of
the
question
but
equally
impossible
did
it
seem
to
speak
with
brutal
decision
once
more
she
must
temporise
and
hope
for
courage
on
another
day
ca
i
really
ca
give
you
a
definite
answer
till
i
have
spoken
with
mr
mumford
i
am
sure
he
will
do
me
this
kindness
sobbed
louise
a
slight
emphasis
on
the
he
touched
mumford
unpleasantly
she
rose
and
began
to
pick
out
some
overblown
flowers
from
a
vase
on
the
table
near
her
presently
louise
became
silent
before
either
of
them
spoke
again
a
postman
knock
sounded
at
the
and
emmeline
went
to
see
what
letter
had
been
delivered
it
was
for
miss
derrick
the
handwriting
as
emmeline
knew
that
of
cobb
bother
louise
murmured
as
she
took
the
letter
from
mumford
hand
i
a
trouble
to
everybody
and
i
do
know
how
it
all
end
i
daresay
i
sha
live
very
long
talk
nonsense
louise
you
like
me
to
go
at
once
mrs
mumford
the
girl
asked
with
a
submissive
sigh
no
let
us
think
over
it
for
a
day
or
two
perhaps
you
quite
made
up
your
mind
after
all
to
this
oddly
enough
louise
gave
no
reply
she
lingered
by
the
window
nervously
bending
and
rolling
her
letter
which
she
did
not
seem
to
think
of
opening
after
a
glance
or
two
of
discreet
curiosity
mumford
left
the
room
daily
duties
called
for
attention
and
she
was
not
at
all
inclined
to
talk
further
with
louise
the
girl
as
soon
as
she
found
herself
alone
broke
cobb
envelope
which
contained
four
sides
of
bold
handwriting
not
a
long
letter
but
as
usual
vigorously
worded
miss
derrick
he
wrote
have
been
in
a
hurry
to
reply
to
your
last
as
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
were
in
one
of
your
touchy
moods
when
you
sent
it
it
was
my
fault
that
i
called
at
the
house
when
you
were
away
i
happened
to
have
business
at
croydon
unexpectedly
and
ran
over
to
sutton
just
on
the
chance
of
seeing
you
and
i
have
no
objection
to
tell
you
all
i
said
to
your
friend
there
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
saying
things
behind
people
backs
that
i
wish
them
to
hear
all
i
did
was
to
ask
out
plainly
whether
was
trying
to
persuade
you
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
she
said
she
was
and
that
she
did
wish
to
interfere
one
way
or
another
i
told
her
that
i
could
ask
no
more
than
that
she
seemed
to
me
a
sensible
sort
of
woman
and
i
do
suppose
you
get
much
harm
from
her
though
i
daresay
she
thinks
more
about
dress
and
amusements
and
so
on
than
is
good
for
her
or
anyone
else
you
say
at
the
end
of
your
letter
that
i
to
let
you
know
when
i
think
of
coming
again
and
if
you
mean
by
that
that
you
would
be
glad
to
see
me
i
can
only
say
thank
you
i
do
mean
to
give
you
up
yet
and
i
do
believe
you
want
me
to
say
what
you
will
i
do
spy
after
you
you
mistaken
in
that
but
i
pretty
much
always
thinking
about
you
and
i
wish
you
were
nearer
to
me
i
may
have
to
go
to
bristol
in
a
week
or
two
and
perhaps
i
shall
be
there
for
a
month
or
more
so
i
must
see
you
before
then
will
you
tell
me
what
day
would
suit
you
after
seven
if
you
do
want
me
to
come
to
the
house
then
meet
me
where
you
like
and
there
only
one
more
thing
i
have
to
say
you
must
deal
honestly
with
me
i
can
wait
but
i
wo
be
deceived
louise
pondered
for
a
long
time
turning
now
to
this
part
of
the
letter
now
to
that
and
the
lines
of
her
face
though
they
made
no
approach
to
smiling
indicated
agreeable
thoughts
tears
had
left
just
sufficient
trace
to
give
her
meditations
a
semblance
of
unwonted
seriousness
about
midday
she
went
up
to
her
room
and
wrote
letters
the
first
was
to
miss
cissy
higgins
ciss
i
dare
say
you
would
like
to
know
that
has
proposed
to
me
if
you
have
any
objection
please
let
me
know
it
by
affectionately
yours
e
derrick
this
she
addressed
to
margate
and
stamped
with
a
little
thump
of
the
fist
her
next
sheet
of
paper
was
devoted
to
mr
bowling
and
the
letter
though
brief
cost
her
some
thought
mr
bowling
your
last
is
so
very
nice
and
kind
that
i
feel
i
ought
to
answer
it
without
delay
but
i
can
not
answer
in
the
way
you
wish
i
must
have
a
long
long
time
to
think
over
such
a
very
important
question
i
do
blame
you
in
the
least
for
your
behaviour
to
someone
we
know
of
and
i
think
after
all
that
happened
you
were
quite
free
it
is
quite
true
that
she
did
not
behave
straightforwardly
and
i
am
very
sorry
to
have
to
say
it
i
shall
not
be
going
home
again
i
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
about
that
i
am
afraid
i
must
not
let
you
come
here
to
call
upon
me
i
have
a
particular
reason
for
it
to
tell
you
the
truth
my
friend
mumford
is
particular
and
rather
fussy
and
has
a
rather
trying
temper
so
please
do
not
come
just
yet
i
am
quite
well
and
enjoying
myself
in
a
quiet
i
remain
sincerely
yours
louise
e
derrick
finally
she
penned
a
reply
to
cobb
and
this
after
a
glance
at
a
railway
gave
her
no
trouble
at
all
cobb
she
scribbled
you
really
see
me
before
you
go
away
to
bristol
or
wherever
it
is
you
had
better
meet
me
on
saturday
at
streatham
station
which
is
about
halfway
between
me
and
you
i
shall
come
by
the
train
from
sutton
which
reaches
streatham
at
yours
truly
was
thursday
when
saturday
came
the
state
of
things
at
runnymede
had
undergone
no
change
whatever
emmeline
still
waited
for
a
moment
of
courage
and
mumford
though
he
did
not
relish
the
prospect
began
to
think
it
more
than
probable
that
miss
derrick
would
hold
her
ground
until
her
actual
marriage
with
mr
bowling
whether
that
unknown
person
would
discharge
the
debt
his
betrothed
was
incurring
seemed
an
altogether
uncertain
matter
louise
in
the
meantime
kept
quiet
as
a
mouse
so
strangely
quiet
indeed
that
emmeline
prophetic
soul
dreaded
some
impending
disturbance
worse
than
any
they
had
yet
suffered
at
luncheon
louise
made
known
that
she
would
have
to
leave
in
the
middle
of
dinner
to
catch
a
train
no
explanation
was
offered
or
asked
but
emmeline
it
being
saturday
said
she
would
put
the
earlier
to
suit
her
friend
convenience
louise
smiled
pleasantly
and
said
how
very
kind
it
was
of
mumford
she
had
no
difficulty
in
reaching
streatham
by
the
time
appointed
unfortunately
it
was
a
cloudy
evening
and
a
spattering
of
rain
fell
from
time
to
time
suppose
you
be
afraid
to
walk
to
the
common
said
cobb
who
stood
waiting
at
the
exit
from
the
station
and
showed
more
satisfaction
in
his
countenance
when
louise
appeared
than
he
evinced
in
words
i
do
care
she
answered
wo
rain
much
and
brought
my
umbrella
and
i
nothing
on
that
will
take
any
harm
she
had
indeed
dressed
herself
in
her
least
demonstrative
costume
cobb
wore
the
usual
garb
of
his
leisure
hours
which
was
better
than
that
in
which
he
had
called
the
other
day
at
runnymede
for
some
minutes
they
walked
towards
streatham
common
without
interchange
of
a
word
and
with
no
glance
at
each
other
then
the
man
coughed
and
said
bluntly
that
he
was
glad
louise
had
come
i
wanted
to
see
you
was
her
answer
about
do
think
i
shall
be
able
to
stay
with
the
mumfords
very
nice
people
but
they
not
exactly
my
sort
and
we
do
get
on
very
well
where
had
i
better
go
why
home
of
course
the
best
place
for
you
cobb
was
prepared
for
a
hot
retort
but
it
did
not
come
after
a
moment
reflection
louise
said
quietly
ca
go
home
i
quarrelled
with
them
too
badly
you
seen
mother
lately
then
i
must
tell
you
how
things
are
she
did
so
with
no
concealment
save
of
the
correspondence
with
mr
bowling
and
the
not
unimportant
statements
concerning
him
which
she
had
made
to
mumford
in
talking
with
cobb
louise
seemed
to
drop
a
degree
or
so
in
social
status
her
language
was
much
less
careful
than
when
she
conversed
with
the
mumfords
and
even
her
voice
struck
a
note
of
less
refinement
decidedly
she
was
more
herself
if
that
could
be
said
of
one
who
very
rarely
made
conscious
disguise
of
her
characteristics
stay
where
you
are
then
for
the
present
said
cobb
when
he
had
listened
attentively
dare
say
you
can
get
along
well
enough
with
the
people
if
you
try
all
very
well
but
what
about
paying
them
i
shall
owe
three
guineas
for
every
week
i
stop
a
great
deal
and
they
ought
to
feed
you
very
well
for
it
replied
the
other
smiling
rather
sourly
be
vulgar
i
suppose
you
think
i
ought
to
live
on
a
few
shillings
a
week
of
people
have
to
but
there
no
reason
why
should
but
look
here
why
should
you
be
quarrelling
with
your
people
now
about
that
fellow
bowling
you
do
see
him
anywhere
do
you
he
flashed
a
glance
at
her
and
louise
answered
with
a
defiant
motion
of
the
head
i
do
but
they
put
the
blame
on
me
all
the
same
i
should
wonder
if
they
think
i
trying
to
get
him
she
opened
her
umbrella
for
heavy
drops
had
begun
to
fall
they
pattered
on
cobb
hard
felt
hat
and
louise
tried
to
shelter
him
as
well
as
herself
mind
me
he
said
here
let
me
hold
that
thing
over
you
if
you
just
put
your
arm
in
mine
it
be
easier
that
the
way
take
two
steps
to
my
one
that
it
again
they
were
silent
for
a
few
moments
they
had
reached
the
common
and
cobb
struck
along
a
path
most
likely
to
be
unfrequented
no
wind
was
blowing
the
rain
fell
in
steady
spots
that
could
all
but
be
counted
and
the
air
grew
dark
i
can
only
propose
one
thing
sounded
the
masculine
voice
can
get
out
of
it
by
marrying
me
louise
gave
a
little
laugh
rather
timid
than
scornful
i
suppose
i
can
but
it
an
awkward
way
it
would
be
rather
like
using
a
to
crack
a
nut
come
sooner
or
later
asserted
cobb
with
genial
confidence
what
i
do
like
about
you
louise
withdrew
her
arm
petulantly
always
speak
as
if
i
could
help
myself
you
suppose
i
have
any
choice
no
doubt
was
the
grim
answer
we
begin
to
quarrel
it
your
fault
pursued
miss
derrick
with
unaccustomed
moderation
of
tone
never
knew
a
man
who
behaved
like
you
do
you
seem
to
think
the
way
to
make
anyone
like
you
is
to
bully
them
we
should
have
got
on
very
much
better
if
you
had
tried
to
be
pleasant
do
think
we
got
along
badly
all
things
considered
cobb
replied
as
if
after
weighing
a
doubt
a
good
deal
rather
be
together
than
apart
it
seems
to
me
or
else
why
do
we
keep
meeting
and
i
do
want
to
bully
anybody
least
of
all
you
a
way
i
have
of
talking
i
suppose
you
must
judge
a
man
by
his
actions
and
his
meaning
not
by
the
tone
of
his
voice
you
know
very
well
what
a
great
deal
i
think
of
you
of
course
i
do
like
it
when
you
begin
to
speak
as
if
you
were
only
playing
with
me
nobody
would
serious
enough
said
louise
trying
to
hold
the
umbrella
over
her
companion
and
only
succeeding
in
directing
moisture
down
the
back
of
his
neck
it
partly
through
you
that
i
got
into
such
difficulties
do
you
make
that
out
it
was
for
you
i
should
very
likely
marry
mr
bowling
he
asked
you
has
he
cried
cobb
staring
at
her
did
you
tell
me
that
before
do
let
me
stand
in
your
way
i
dare
say
he
just
the
kind
of
man
for
you
at
all
events
he
like
you
in
not
knowing
his
own
mind
on
go
on
louise
exclaimed
carelessly
plenty
of
time
say
all
you
got
to
say
from
the
gloom
of
the
eastward
sky
came
a
rattling
of
thunder
like
quick
cobb
checked
his
steps
must
go
any
further
you
getting
wet
and
the
rain
likely
to
stop
shall
not
go
back
louise
answered
something
has
been
settled
and
she
stood
before
him
her
eyes
cast
down
whilst
cobb
looked
at
the
darkening
sky
want
to
know
what
going
to
become
of
me
the
mumfords
wo
keep
me
much
longer
and
i
do
wish
to
stay
where
i
not
wanted
us
walk
down
the
hill
a
flash
of
lightning
made
louise
start
and
the
thunder
rattled
again
but
only
light
drops
were
falling
the
girl
stood
her
ground
want
to
know
what
i
am
to
do
if
you
ca
help
me
say
so
and
let
me
go
my
own
way
course
i
can
help
you
that
is
if
you
be
honest
with
me
i
want
to
know
first
of
all
whether
you
been
encouraging
that
man
bowling
i
have
well
i
believe
you
and
now
i
make
you
a
fair
offer
marry
me
as
soon
as
i
can
make
the
arrangements
and
i
pay
all
you
owe
and
see
that
you
are
in
comfortable
lodgings
until
i
time
to
get
a
house
it
could
be
done
before
i
go
to
bristol
and
then
of
course
you
could
go
with
me
speak
said
louise
after
a
short
silence
as
if
you
were
making
an
agreement
with
a
servant
all
nonsense
and
you
know
it
i
told
you
how
i
think
often
enough
in
letters
and
i
not
good
at
saying
it
look
here
i
do
think
it
very
wise
to
stand
out
in
the
middle
of
the
common
in
a
thunderstorm
let
us
walk
on
and
i
think
i
would
put
down
your
umbrella
would
trouble
you
much
if
i
were
struck
with
lightning
right
take
it
so
i
sha
trouble
to
contradict
louise
followed
his
advice
and
they
began
to
walk
quickly
down
the
slope
towards
streatham
neither
spoke
until
they
were
in
the
high
road
again
a
strong
wind
was
driving
the
to
other
regions
and
the
thunder
had
ceased
there
came
a
grey
twilight
rows
of
lamps
made
a
shimmering
upon
the
wet
ways
sort
of
a
house
would
you
take
louise
asked
suddenly
a
decent
enough
house
what
kind
do
you
want
like
the
mumfords
it
need
be
quite
so
large
she
added
quickly
a
house
with
a
garden
in
a
nice
road
and
in
a
respectable
part
would
suit
me
well
enough
answered
cobb
cheerfully
seem
to
think
i
want
to
drag
you
down
but
you
very
much
mistaken
i
doing
pretty
well
and
likely
as
far
as
i
can
see
to
do
better
i
do
grudge
you
money
far
from
it
all
i
want
to
know
is
that
you
marry
me
for
my
own
sake
he
dropped
his
voice
not
to
express
tenderness
but
because
other
people
were
near
upon
louise
however
it
had
a
pleasing
effect
and
she
smiled
well
she
made
answer
in
the
same
subdued
tone
let
us
settle
it
in
that
way
they
talked
amicably
for
the
rest
of
the
time
that
they
spent
together
it
was
nearly
an
hour
and
never
before
had
they
succeeded
in
conversing
so
long
without
a
quarrel
louise
became
and
mirthful
her
companion
though
less
abandoned
to
the
mood
of
the
moment
wore
a
hopeful
countenance
through
all
his
roughness
cobb
was
distinguished
by
a
personal
delicacy
which
no
doubt
had
impressed
louise
say
what
she
might
of
pretended
fears
at
parting
he
merely
shook
hands
with
her
as
always
chapter
vii
glad
of
a
free
evening
emmeline
after
dinner
walked
round
to
fentiman
louise
had
put
a
restraint
upon
the
wonted
friendly
intercourse
between
the
mumfords
and
their
only
familiar
acquaintances
at
sutton
fentiman
liked
to
talk
of
purely
domestic
matters
and
in
a
stranger
presence
she
was
never
at
ease
coming
alone
and
when
the
children
were
all
safe
in
bed
emmeline
had
a
warm
welcome
for
the
first
time
she
spoke
of
her
troublesome
guest
without
reserve
this
chat
would
have
been
restful
and
enjoyable
but
for
a
most
unfortunate
remark
that
fell
from
the
elder
lady
a
perfectly
innocent
mention
of
something
her
husband
had
told
her
but
secretly
so
disturbing
mumford
that
after
hearing
it
she
got
away
as
soon
as
possible
and
walked
quickly
home
with
dark
countenance
it
was
ten
louise
had
not
yet
returned
but
might
do
so
any
moment
wishing
to
be
sure
of
privacy
in
a
conversation
with
her
husband
emmeline
summoned
him
from
his
book
to
the
bedroom
what
has
happened
now
exclaimed
mumford
this
kind
of
thing
goes
on
much
longer
i
shall
feel
inclined
to
take
a
lodging
in
town
have
heard
something
very
strange
i
can
hardly
believe
it
there
must
have
been
a
mistake
is
it
really
one
nerves
it
true
that
on
thursday
evening
you
and
miss
derrick
were
seen
talking
together
at
the
station
thursday
the
day
she
went
off
and
came
back
again
after
dinner
mumford
would
gladly
have
got
out
of
this
scrape
at
any
expense
of
mendacity
but
he
saw
at
once
how
useless
such
an
attempt
would
prove
exasperated
by
the
result
of
his
indiscretion
and
resenting
as
all
men
do
the
undignified
necessity
of
defending
himself
he
flew
into
a
rage
yes
it
true
and
what
next
the
girl
had
waylaid
him
begged
him
to
intercede
for
her
with
his
wife
of
course
it
would
have
been
better
to
come
home
and
reveal
the
matter
he
did
do
so
because
it
seemed
to
put
him
in
a
silly
position
for
heaven
sake
let
the
whole
absurd
business
be
forgotten
and
done
with
emmeline
though
not
sufficiently
enlightened
to
be
above
small
jealousies
would
have
been
ashamed
to
declare
her
feeling
with
the
energy
of
unsophisticated
female
nature
she
replied
coldly
and
loftily
that
the
matter
of
course
done
with
that
it
interested
her
no
more
but
that
she
could
not
help
regretting
an
instance
of
secretiveness
such
as
she
had
never
before
discovered
in
her
husband
surely
he
had
put
himself
in
a
much
sillier
position
as
things
turned
out
than
if
he
had
followed
the
dictates
of
honour
upshot
of
it
is
this
cried
mumford
derrick
has
to
leave
the
house
and
if
necessary
i
shall
tell
her
so
myself
again
emmeline
was
cold
and
lofty
there
was
no
necessity
whatever
for
any
further
communication
between
clarence
and
miss
derrick
let
the
affair
be
left
entirely
in
her
hands
indeed
she
must
very
specially
request
that
clarence
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
miss
derrick
business
whereupon
mumford
took
offence
did
emmeline
wish
to
imply
that
there
had
been
anything
improper
in
his
behaviour
beyond
the
paltry
indiscretion
to
which
he
had
confessed
no
emmeline
was
thankful
to
say
that
she
did
not
harbour
base
suspicions
then
rejoined
mumford
let
this
be
the
last
word
of
a
difference
as
hateful
to
him
as
to
her
and
he
left
the
room
his
wife
did
not
linger
more
than
a
minute
behind
him
and
she
sat
in
the
to
await
miss
derrick
return
mumford
kept
apart
in
what
was
called
the
library
to
her
credit
emmeline
tried
hard
to
believe
that
she
had
learnt
the
whole
truth
her
mind
as
she
had
justly
declared
was
not
prone
to
ignoble
imaginings
but
acquitting
her
husband
by
no
means
involved
an
equal
charity
towards
louise
hitherto
uncertain
in
her
judgment
she
had
now
the
relief
of
an
assurance
that
miss
derrick
was
not
at
all
a
proper
person
to
entertain
as
a
guest
on
whatever
terms
the
incident
of
the
railway
station
proved
her
to
be
utterly
lacking
in
in
feminine
modesty
even
if
her
behaviour
merited
no
darker
description
emmeline
could
now
face
with
confidence
the
scene
from
which
she
had
shrunk
not
only
was
it
a
duty
to
insist
upon
miss
derrick
departure
it
would
be
a
positive
pleasure
louise
very
soon
entered
she
came
into
the
room
with
her
brightest
look
and
cried
gaily
i
hope
i
have
kept
you
waiting
for
me
are
you
alone
i
have
been
out
you
the
storm
here
i
not
going
to
keep
you
talking
you
look
tired
am
rather
said
emmeline
with
reserve
she
had
no
intention
of
allowing
louise
to
suspect
the
real
cause
of
what
she
was
about
to
say
that
would
have
seemed
to
her
undignified
but
she
could
not
speak
quite
naturally
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
sit
down
for
a
minute
the
girl
took
a
chair
and
began
to
draw
off
her
gloves
she
understood
what
was
coming
it
appeared
in
emmeline
face
to
say
to
me
mrs
mumford
hope
you
wo
think
me
unkind
i
feel
obliged
to
ask
you
when
you
will
be
able
to
make
new
arrangements
would
like
me
to
go
soon
said
louise
inspecting
her
and
speaking
without
irritation
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
think
it
better
you
should
leave
us
forgive
this
plain
speaking
miss
derrick
it
always
best
to
be
perfectly
straightforward
is
it
whether
she
felt
the
force
of
this
innuendo
or
not
louise
took
it
in
good
part
as
if
the
idea
had
only
just
struck
her
she
looked
up
cheerfully
quite
right
mumford
i
sure
you
been
very
kind
to
me
and
i
had
a
very
pleasant
time
here
but
it
would
do
for
me
to
stay
longer
may
i
wait
over
just
till
wednesday
morning
to
have
an
answer
to
a
letter
if
it
is
quite
understood
that
there
will
be
no
delay
beyond
that
there
are
circumstances
private
matters
i
do
feel
quite
able
to
explain
but
i
must
be
sure
that
you
will
have
left
us
by
wednesday
afternoon
may
be
sure
of
it
i
will
write
a
line
and
post
it
for
it
to
go
as
soon
as
possible
therewith
louise
stood
up
and
smiling
withdrew
emmeline
was
both
relieved
and
surprised
she
had
not
thought
it
possible
for
the
girl
to
conduct
herself
at
such
a
juncture
with
such
perfect
propriety
an
outbreak
of
perhaps
of
insolence
had
seemed
more
than
likely
at
best
she
looked
for
tears
and
entreaties
well
it
was
over
and
by
wednesday
the
house
would
be
restored
to
its
ancient
calm
ancient
indeed
one
could
not
believe
that
so
short
a
time
had
passed
since
miss
derrick
first
entered
the
portals
only
one
more
day
blindness
to
the
future
kindly
given
that
each
may
fill
the
circle
marked
by
heaven
at
school
emmeline
had
learnt
and
recited
these
lines
but
it
was
long
since
they
had
recurred
to
her
memory
in
ten
minutes
louise
had
written
her
letter
she
went
out
returned
and
looked
in
at
the
with
a
pleasant
smile
mrs
mumford
miss
derrick
for
the
grace
of
the
thing
emmeline
would
have
liked
to
say
but
could
not
bring
her
lips
to
utter
the
name
about
a
year
ago
there
had
been
a
little
misunderstanding
between
and
mumford
which
lasted
for
some
hours
during
which
they
had
nothing
to
say
to
each
other
they
found
themselves
in
a
similar
situation
and
remembered
that
last
difference
and
wondered
both
of
them
at
the
harmony
of
their
married
life
it
was
in
truth
wonderful
enough
twelve
months
without
a
shadow
of
between
them
the
reflection
compelled
mumford
to
speak
when
his
head
was
on
the
pillow
we
making
fools
of
ourselves
just
tell
me
what
you
have
done
ca
see
how
am
guilty
of
foolishness
was
the
reply
why
are
you
angry
with
me
do
like
deceit
if
i
do
dislike
it
just
as
much
when
is
that
girl
going
emmeline
made
known
the
understanding
at
which
she
had
arrived
and
her
husband
breathed
an
exclamation
of
profound
thankfulness
but
peace
was
not
perfectly
restored
in
another
room
louise
lay
communing
with
her
thoughts
which
were
not
at
all
disagreeable
she
had
written
to
cobb
telling
him
what
had
happened
and
asking
him
to
let
her
know
by
wednesday
morning
what
she
was
to
do
she
could
not
go
home
he
must
not
bid
her
do
so
but
she
would
take
a
lodging
wherever
he
liked
the
position
seemed
romantic
and
enjoyable
not
till
after
her
actual
marriage
should
the
people
at
home
know
what
had
become
of
her
she
was
marrying
with
utter
disregard
of
all
her
dearest
ambitions
all
the
same
she
had
rather
be
the
wife
of
cobb
than
of
anyone
else
her
stepfather
might
recover
his
old
kindness
and
generosity
as
soon
as
he
knew
she
no
longer
stood
in
cissy
way
and
that
she
had
never
seriously
thought
of
marrying
mr
bowling
had
she
not
thought
of
it
the
question
did
not
enter
her
own
mind
and
she
would
have
been
quite
incapable
of
passing
a
satisfactory
on
the
subject
mumford
foreseeing
the
difficulty
of
spending
the
next
day
at
home
told
her
husband
in
the
morning
that
she
would
have
early
luncheon
and
go
to
see
grove
i
should
like
you
to
fetch
me
from
there
after
business
please
will
answered
clarence
readily
he
mentally
added
a
hope
that
his
wife
did
not
mean
to
supervise
him
henceforth
and
for
ever
if
so
their
troubles
were
only
beginning
at
breakfast
louise
continued
to
be
discretion
itself
she
talked
of
her
departure
on
the
morrow
as
though
it
had
long
been
a
settled
thing
and
was
quite
unconnected
with
disagreeable
circumstances
only
midway
in
the
morning
did
mumford
who
had
been
busy
with
her
child
speak
of
the
early
luncheon
and
her
journey
to
town
she
hoped
miss
derrick
would
not
mind
being
left
alone
do
speak
of
it
answered
louise
lots
to
do
give
my
kind
regards
to
mrs
grove
so
they
ate
together
at
midday
rather
silently
but
with
faces
composed
and
emmeline
after
a
last
look
into
the
nursery
hastened
away
to
catch
her
train
she
had
no
misgivings
during
her
absence
all
would
be
well
as
ever
louise
passed
the
time
without
difficulty
and
at
seven
made
an
excellent
dinner
this
evening
no
reply
could
be
expected
from
cobb
as
he
was
not
likely
to
have
received
her
letter
of
last
night
till
his
return
home
from
business
still
there
might
be
something
from
someone
she
always
looked
eagerly
for
the
postman
the
weather
was
gloomy
not
long
after
eight
the
housemaid
brought
in
a
lighted
lamp
and
set
it
as
usual
upon
the
little
black
table
in
the
and
in
the
same
moment
the
knocker
of
the
front
door
sounded
a
vigorous
a
visitor
summons
chapter
viii
may
be
someone
calling
upon
me
said
louise
to
the
servant
me
know
the
name
before
you
show
anyone
in
course
miss
replied
the
domestic
with
pert
familiarity
and
took
her
time
in
arranging
the
shade
of
the
lamp
when
she
returned
from
the
door
it
was
to
announce
smilingly
that
cobb
wished
to
see
miss
derrick
to
show
him
in
louise
stood
in
an
attitude
of
joyous
excitement
her
eyes
sparkling
but
at
the
first
glance
she
perceived
that
her
mood
was
by
no
means
correspondingly
gay
cobb
stalked
forward
and
kept
a
stern
gaze
upon
her
but
said
nothing
you
got
my
letter
i
suppose
letter
he
had
not
been
home
since
so
louise
appeal
to
him
for
advice
lay
waiting
his
arrival
impatiently
she
described
the
course
of
events
as
soon
as
she
had
finished
cobb
threw
his
hat
aside
and
addressed
her
harshly
want
to
know
what
you
mean
by
writing
to
your
sister
that
you
are
going
to
marry
bowling
i
saw
your
mother
this
morning
and
what
she
told
me
it
must
have
been
only
a
day
or
two
ago
that
you
said
that
just
explain
if
you
please
i
about
sick
of
this
kind
of
thing
and
i
have
the
truth
out
of
you
his
anger
had
never
taken
such
a
form
as
this
for
the
first
time
louise
did
in
truth
feel
afraid
of
him
she
shrank
away
her
heart
throbbed
and
her
tongue
refused
its
office
what
you
mean
by
it
cobb
repeated
in
a
voice
that
was
all
the
more
alarming
because
he
kept
it
low
you
write
that
to
your
sister
but
i
never
meant
it
it
was
just
to
make
her
angry
expect
me
to
believe
that
and
if
it
true
does
it
make
you
out
a
nice
sort
of
girl
but
i
do
believe
it
you
been
thinking
of
him
in
that
way
all
along
and
you
been
writing
to
him
or
meeting
him
since
you
came
here
what
sort
of
behaviour
do
you
call
this
louise
was
recovering
the
irritability
of
her
own
temper
began
to
support
her
courage
if
i
have
i
never
given
any
promise
till
last
night
had
i
i
was
free
to
marry
anyone
i
liked
was
i
what
do
mean
by
coming
here
and
going
on
like
this
i
told
you
the
truth
about
that
letter
and
i
always
told
you
the
truth
about
everything
if
you
do
like
it
say
so
and
go
cobb
was
impressed
by
the
energy
of
her
defence
he
looked
her
straight
in
the
eyes
and
paused
a
moment
then
spoke
less
violently
have
told
me
the
truth
i
want
to
know
when
you
saw
bowling
last
have
seen
him
since
i
left
home
did
you
write
to
him
last
same
day
i
wrote
to
cissy
and
i
shall
answer
no
more
questions
course
not
but
that
quite
enough
you
been
playing
a
double
game
if
you
have
told
lies
you
acted
them
what
sort
of
a
wife
would
you
make
how
could
i
ever
believe
a
word
you
said
i
shall
have
no
more
to
do
with
you
he
turned
away
and
in
the
violence
of
the
movement
knocked
over
a
little
toy
chair
one
of
those
perfectly
useless
and
no
less
ugly
impediments
which
stand
about
the
floor
of
a
too
angry
to
stoop
and
set
the
object
on
its
legs
again
he
strode
towards
the
door
louise
followed
him
are
going
she
asked
in
a
struggling
voice
cobb
paid
no
attention
and
all
but
reached
the
door
she
laid
a
hand
upon
him
are
going
the
touch
and
the
voice
checked
him
again
he
turned
abruptly
and
seized
the
hand
that
rested
upon
his
arm
are
you
stopping
me
what
do
you
want
with
me
i
to
help
you
out
of
the
fix
you
got
into
is
that
it
i
to
find
you
a
lodging
and
take
no
end
of
trouble
and
then
in
a
week
time
get
a
letter
to
say
that
you
want
nothing
more
to
do
with
me
louise
was
pale
with
anger
and
fear
and
as
many
other
emotions
as
her
little
heart
and
brain
could
well
hold
she
did
not
look
her
best
far
from
it
but
the
man
saw
something
in
her
eyes
which
threw
a
fresh
spell
upon
him
still
grasping
her
one
hand
he
caught
her
by
the
other
arm
held
her
as
far
off
as
he
could
and
glared
passionately
as
he
spoke
do
you
want
know
i
told
you
the
truth
his
grasp
hurt
her
she
tried
to
release
herself
and
moved
backwards
for
a
moment
cobb
left
her
free
she
moved
backward
again
her
eyes
drawing
him
on
she
felt
her
power
and
could
not
be
content
with
thus
much
exercise
of
it
may
go
if
you
like
but
you
understand
if
you
do
cobb
inflamed
with
desire
and
jealousy
made
an
effort
to
recapture
her
louise
sprang
away
from
him
but
immediately
behind
her
lay
the
foolish
little
chair
which
he
had
kicked
over
and
just
beyond
stood
the
scarcely
less
foolish
little
table
which
supported
the
heavy
lamp
with
its
bowl
of
coloured
glass
and
its
spreading
yellow
shade
she
tottered
back
fell
with
all
her
weight
against
the
table
and
brought
the
lamp
crashing
to
the
floor
a
shriek
of
terror
from
louise
from
her
lover
a
shout
of
alarm
blended
with
the
sound
of
breaking
glass
in
an
instant
a
great
flame
shot
up
half
way
to
the
ceiling
the
was
ablaze
the
screen
mumford
wedding
present
forthwith
caught
fire
from
a
burning
tongue
that
ran
along
the
carpet
and
louise
dress
well
sprinkled
with
paraffin
aided
the
conflagration
cobb
of
course
saw
only
the
danger
to
the
girl
he
seized
the
woollen
hearthrug
and
tried
to
wrap
it
about
her
but
with
screams
of
pain
and
frantic
struggles
louise
did
her
best
to
thwart
his
purpose
the
window
was
open
and
now
a
servant
rushing
in
to
see
what
the
uproar
meant
gave
the
blaze
every
benefit
of
draught
water
roared
cobb
who
had
just
succeeded
in
extinguishing
louise
dress
and
was
carrying
her
still
despite
her
struggles
out
of
the
room
one
of
you
take
miss
derrick
to
the
next
house
bring
water
you
all
three
servants
were
scampering
and
screeching
about
the
hall
cobb
caught
hold
of
one
of
them
and
all
but
twisted
her
arm
out
of
its
socket
at
his
fierce
command
the
woman
supported
louise
into
the
garden
and
thence
after
a
minute
or
two
of
faintness
on
the
sufferer
part
led
her
to
the
gate
of
the
neighbouring
house
the
people
who
lived
there
chanced
to
be
taking
the
air
on
their
front
lawn
without
delay
louise
was
conveyed
beneath
the
roof
and
her
host
a
man
of
energy
sped
towards
the
fire
to
be
of
what
assistance
he
could
the
the
screen
the
little
table
and
the
diminutive
chair
blazed
gallantly
and
with
such
a
volleying
of
poisonous
fumes
that
cobb
could
scarce
hold
his
ground
to
do
battle
louise
out
of
the
way
he
at
once
became
cool
and
resourceful
before
a
flame
could
reach
the
window
he
had
rent
down
the
flimsy
curtains
and
flung
them
outside
bellowing
for
the
water
which
was
so
long
in
coming
he
used
the
hearthrug
to
some
purpose
on
the
outskirts
of
the
bonfire
but
had
to
keep
falling
back
for
fresh
air
then
appeared
a
pail
and
a
can
which
he
emptied
effectively
and
next
moment
sounded
the
voice
of
the
gentleman
from
next
door
you
a
garden
hose
set
it
on
to
the
tap
and
bring
it
in
here
the
hose
was
brought
into
play
and
in
no
great
time
the
last
flame
had
flickered
out
amid
a
deluge
when
all
danger
was
at
an
end
one
of
the
servants
the
uttered
a
sudden
shriek
it
merely
signified
that
she
had
now
thought
for
the
first
time
of
the
little
child
asleep
upstairs
aided
by
the
housemaid
she
rushed
to
the
nursery
snatched
her
charge
from
bed
and
carried
the
unhappy
youngster
into
the
breezes
of
the
night
where
he
screamed
at
the
top
of
his
gamut
cobb
when
he
no
longer
feared
that
the
house
would
be
burnt
down
hurried
to
inquire
after
louise
she
lay
on
a
couch
wrapped
in
a
for
the
side
and
one
sleeve
of
her
dress
had
been
burnt
away
her
moaning
never
ceased
there
was
a
on
the
lower
part
of
her
face
and
she
stared
with
eyes
of
terror
and
anguish
at
whoever
approached
her
already
a
doctor
had
been
sent
for
and
cobb
reporting
that
all
was
safe
at
wished
to
remove
her
at
once
to
her
own
bed
room
and
the
strangers
were
eager
to
assist
will
the
mumfords
say
louise
asked
of
a
sudden
trying
to
raise
herself
all
that
to
me
cobb
replied
reassuringly
make
it
all
right
do
trouble
yourself
the
nervous
shock
had
made
her
powerless
they
carried
her
in
a
chair
back
to
and
upstairs
to
her
bedroom
scarcely
was
this
done
when
and
mumford
after
a
leisurely
walk
from
the
station
approached
their
garden
gate
the
sight
of
a
little
crowd
of
people
in
the
quiet
road
the
smell
of
burning
loud
voices
of
excited
servants
caused
them
to
run
forward
in
alarm
emmeline
frenzied
by
the
certainty
that
her
own
house
was
on
fire
began
to
cry
aloud
for
her
child
and
mumford
rushed
like
a
madman
through
the
garden
all
right
said
a
man
who
stood
in
the
doorway
mumford
it
all
right
there
been
a
fire
but
we
got
it
out
emmeline
learnt
at
the
same
moment
that
her
child
had
suffered
no
harm
but
she
would
not
pause
until
she
saw
the
little
one
and
held
him
in
her
embrace
meanwhile
cobb
and
mumford
talked
in
the
devastated
which
was
illumined
with
candles
a
bad
job
mumford
my
name
is
cobb
i
daresay
heard
of
me
i
came
to
see
miss
derrick
and
i
was
clumsy
enough
to
knock
the
lamp
over
the
lamp
over
how
could
you
do
that
were
you
drunk
but
you
may
well
ask
the
question
i
stumbled
over
something
a
little
chair
i
think
and
fell
against
the
table
with
the
lamp
on
it
miss
derrick
she
got
rather
badly
burnt
i
afraid
we
sent
for
a
doctor
here
i
am
spoke
a
voice
behind
them
to
see
this
mr
mumford
the
two
went
upstairs
together
and
on
the
first
landing
encountered
emmeline
sobbing
and
wailing
hysterically
with
the
child
in
her
arms
her
husband
spoke
soothingly
do
emmy
here
billings
come
to
see
miss
derrick
she
the
only
one
that
has
been
hurt
go
down
there
a
good
girl
and
send
somebody
to
help
in
miss
derrick
room
you
ca
be
any
use
yourself
just
now
how
did
it
happen
oh
did
it
happen
come
and
tell
you
all
about
it
better
put
the
boy
to
bed
again
had
you
when
she
had
recovered
her
senses
emmeline
took
this
advice
and
leaving
the
nurse
by
the
child
cot
went
down
to
survey
the
ruin
of
her
property
it
was
a
sorry
sight
where
she
had
left
a
such
as
any
suburban
lady
in
moderate
circumstances
might
be
proud
of
she
now
beheld
a
mere
mass
of
unrecognisable
furniture
heaped
on
what
had
once
been
a
carpet
amid
dripping
walls
and
under
a
grimed
ceiling
oh
she
all
but
sank
before
the
horror
of
the
spectacle
then
in
a
voice
of
fierce
conviction
did
it
did
it
it
was
because
i
told
her
to
leave
i
she
did
it
on
purpose
mumford
closed
the
door
of
the
room
shutting
out
cobb
and
the
cook
and
the
housemaid
he
repeated
the
story
cobb
had
told
him
and
quietly
urged
the
improbability
of
his
wife
explanation
miss
derrick
he
pointed
out
was
lying
prostrate
from
severe
burns
the
fire
must
have
been
accidental
but
the
accident
to
be
sure
was
extraordinary
enough
thereupon
mumford
wrath
turned
against
cobb
what
business
had
such
a
man
a
savage
in
he
must
have
come
knowing
that
she
and
her
husband
were
away
for
the
evening
can
question
him
if
you
like
said
mumford
out
there
emmeline
opened
the
door
and
at
once
heard
a
cry
of
pain
from
upstairs
mumford
also
hearing
it
and
seeing
face
by
the
light
of
the
hall
lamp
whispered
to
his
wife
you
better
go
up
dear
billings
may
think
it
strange
it
was
much
wiser
to
urge
this
consideration
than
to
make
a
direct
plea
for
mercy
emmeline
did
not
care
to
have
it
reported
that
selfish
distress
made
her
indifferent
to
the
sufferings
of
a
friend
staying
in
her
house
but
she
could
not
pass
cobb
without
addressing
him
severely
are
the
cause
of
this
am
mumford
and
i
can
only
say
that
i
do
my
best
to
make
good
the
damage
to
your
house
good
i
fancy
you
have
strange
ideas
of
the
value
of
the
property
destroyed
insolence
was
no
characteristic
of
mumford
but
calamity
had
put
her
beside
herself
she
spoke
not
in
her
own
person
but
as
a
woman
whose
carpets
curtains
and
have
ignominiously
perished
make
it
good
cobb
repeated
humbly
long
it
takes
me
and
do
be
angry
with
that
poor
girl
mumford
it
her
fault
not
in
any
way
she
did
know
i
was
coming
she
asked
me
to
come
i
entirely
to
blame
mean
to
say
you
knocked
over
the
table
by
accident
did
indeed
and
i
wish
i
been
burnt
myself
instead
of
her
he
had
suffered
by
the
way
no
inconsiderable
scorching
to
which
his
hands
would
testify
for
many
a
week
but
of
this
he
was
still
hardly
aware
emmeline
with
a
glance
of
uttermost
scorn
left
him
and
ascended
to
the
room
where
the
doctor
was
busy
free
to
behave
as
he
thought
fit
mumford
beckoned
cobb
to
follow
him
into
the
front
garden
where
they
conversed
with
masculine
calm
shall
put
up
at
sutton
for
the
night
said
cobb
perhaps
you
let
me
call
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
to
ask
how
she
gets
on
course
we
see
the
doctor
when
he
comes
down
but
i
wish
i
could
understand
how
you
managed
to
throw
the
lamp
down
truth
is
cobb
replied
were
quarrelling
i
heard
something
about
her
that
made
me
wild
and
i
came
and
behaved
like
a
fool
i
feel
just
now
as
if
i
could
go
and
cut
my
throat
that
the
fact
if
anything
happens
to
her
i
believe
i
shall
i
might
as
well
in
any
case
she
never
look
at
me
again
do
take
such
a
dark
view
of
it
the
doctor
came
out
on
his
way
to
fetch
certain
requirements
and
the
two
men
walked
with
him
to
his
house
in
the
next
road
they
learned
that
louise
was
not
dangerously
injured
her
recovery
would
be
merely
a
matter
of
time
and
care
cobb
gave
a
description
of
the
fire
and
his
hearers
marvelled
that
the
results
were
no
worse
must
have
some
burns
too
said
the
doctor
whose
curiosity
was
piqued
by
everything
he
saw
and
heard
of
the
strange
occurrence
thought
so
those
hands
must
be
attended
to
meanwhile
emmeline
sat
by
the
bedside
and
listened
to
the
hysterical
lamentation
in
which
louise
gave
her
own
the
true
account
of
the
catastrophe
it
was
all
her
fault
and
upon
her
let
all
the
blame
fall
she
would
humble
herself
to
higgins
and
get
him
to
pay
for
the
furniture
destroyed
if
mumford
would
but
forgive
her
and
so
on
as
her
poor
body
agonised
and
the
blood
grew
feverish
in
her
veins
chapter
ix
it
certainly
why
should
we
bear
the
loss
if
he
able
to
make
it
good
he
seems
to
be
very
well
off
for
an
unmarried
man
replied
mumford
he
just
going
to
marry
and
it
seems
well
after
all
you
know
he
did
really
cause
the
damage
i
should
have
felt
much
less
scruple
if
higgins
had
offered
to
pay
cause
the
damage
asseverated
emmeline
was
his
gross
or
violent
behaviour
if
we
had
been
insured
it
would
matter
so
much
and
pray
let
this
be
a
warning
and
insure
at
once
however
you
look
at
it
he
ought
to
pay
emmeline
temper
had
suffered
much
since
she
made
the
acquaintance
of
miss
derrick
aforetime
she
could
discuss
difference
of
opinion
now
a
hint
of
diversity
drove
her
at
once
to
the
female
weapon
angry
and
iterative
assertion
her
native
delicacy
also
seemed
to
have
degenerated
mumford
could
only
hold
his
tongue
and
trust
that
this
would
be
but
a
temporary
obscurement
of
his
wife
amiable
virtues
cobb
had
written
from
bristol
a
week
after
the
accident
formally
requesting
a
statement
of
the
pecuniary
loss
which
the
mumfords
had
suffered
he
was
resolved
to
repay
them
and
would
do
so
if
possible
as
soon
as
he
knew
the
sum
mumford
felt
a
trifle
ashamed
to
make
the
necessary
declaration
at
the
outside
even
with
expenses
of
painting
and
papering
their
actual
damage
could
not
be
estimated
at
more
than
fifty
pounds
and
even
emmeline
did
not
wish
to
save
appearances
by
making
an
excessive
demand
the
one
costly
object
in
the
room
the
piano
was
practically
uninjured
and
sundry
other
pieces
of
furniture
could
easily
be
restored
for
cobb
and
his
companion
as
amateur
firemen
had
by
no
means
gone
recklessly
to
work
by
when
the
floor
was
still
a
swamp
things
looked
more
desperate
than
they
proved
to
be
on
subsequent
investigation
and
it
is
wonderful
at
how
little
outlay
in
our
glistening
times
a
villa
may
be
fashionably
equipped
so
mumford
wrote
to
his
correspondent
that
only
a
few
had
absolutely
perished
that
it
was
not
his
wish
to
make
any
demand
at
all
but
that
if
cobb
insisted
on
offering
restitution
why
a
matter
of
fifty
pounds
etc
etc
and
in
a
few
days
this
sum
arrived
in
the
form
of
a
draft
upon
respectable
bankers
of
course
the
house
was
in
grievous
disorder
upholsterers
workmen
would
have
been
bad
enough
but
much
worse
was
the
establishment
of
higgins
by
her
daughter
bedside
which
naturally
involved
her
presence
as
a
guest
at
table
and
the
endurance
of
her
conversation
whenever
she
chose
to
come
downstairs
mumford
urged
his
wife
to
take
her
summer
holiday
to
go
away
with
the
child
until
all
was
put
right
again
a
phrase
which
included
the
removal
of
miss
derrick
to
her
own
home
but
of
this
emmeline
would
not
hear
how
could
she
enjoy
an
hour
of
mental
quietude
when
for
all
she
knew
higgins
and
the
patient
might
be
throwing
lamps
at
each
other
and
her
jealousy
was
still
active
though
she
did
not
allow
it
to
betray
itself
in
words
clarence
seemed
to
her
quite
needlessly
anxious
in
his
inquiries
concerning
miss
derrick
condition
until
that
young
lady
had
disappeared
from
for
ever
emmeline
would
keep
matronly
watch
and
ward
higgins
declared
at
least
a
score
of
times
every
day
that
she
could
understand
how
this
dreadful
affair
had
come
to
pass
the
most
complete
explanation
from
her
daughter
availed
nothing
she
deemed
the
event
an
insoluble
mystery
and
in
familiar
talk
with
mumford
breathed
singular
charges
against
louise
lover
shielding
him
my
dear
i
no
doubt
of
it
i
never
had
a
very
good
opinion
of
him
but
now
she
shall
never
marry
him
with
consent
to
this
kind
of
remark
emmeline
at
length
deigned
no
reply
she
grew
to
detest
higgins
and
escaped
her
society
by
every
possible
manoeuvre
how
pleasant
it
is
she
explained
bitterly
to
her
husband
think
that
everybody
in
the
road
is
talking
about
us
with
contempt
of
course
the
servants
have
spread
nice
stories
and
the
wilkinsons
these
were
the
people
next
door
upon
us
as
hardly
respectable
even
fentiman
said
yesterday
that
she
really
could
not
conceive
how
i
came
to
take
that
girl
into
the
house
i
acknowledged
that
i
must
have
been
crazy
we
thoroughly
upset
replied
mumford
with
irritation
at
this
purposeless
talk
we
better
leave
the
house
and
go
to
live
as
far
away
as
possible
i
very
much
wish
we
could
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
be
happy
again
at
sutton
and
clarence
went
off
muttering
to
himself
about
the
absurdity
and
the
selfishness
of
women
for
a
week
or
ten
days
louise
lay
very
ill
then
her
vigorous
constitution
began
to
assert
itself
it
helped
her
greatly
towards
convalescence
when
she
found
that
the
scorches
on
her
face
would
not
leave
a
permanent
blemish
mumford
came
into
the
room
once
a
day
and
sat
for
a
few
minutes
neither
of
them
desiring
longer
communion
but
they
managed
to
exchange
inquiries
and
remarks
with
a
show
of
friendliness
when
the
fifty
pounds
came
from
cobb
emmeline
made
no
mention
of
it
louise
said
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
he
has
paid
the
money
i
very
glad
of
that
cobb
insisted
on
paying
mumford
answered
with
reserve
could
not
hurt
his
feelings
by
refusing
that
all
right
is
it
you
wo
think
so
badly
of
us
now
of
course
you
wish
you
never
set
eyes
on
me
mumford
but
that
only
natural
in
your
place
i
sure
i
should
feel
the
same
still
now
the
money
paid
you
wo
always
think
unkindly
of
me
will
you
the
girl
lay
propped
on
pillows
her
pale
face
with
its
healing
scars
bore
witness
to
what
she
had
undergone
and
one
of
her
arms
was
completely
swathed
in
bandages
emmeline
did
not
soften
towards
her
but
the
frank
speech
the
rather
pathetic
little
smile
in
decency
demanded
a
suave
response
shall
wish
you
every
happiness
louise
you
we
shall
be
married
as
soon
as
ever
i
well
but
sure
i
do
know
where
mother
hates
his
very
name
and
does
her
best
to
set
me
against
him
but
i
just
let
her
talk
we
beginning
to
quarrel
a
little
did
you
hear
us
this
morning
i
try
to
keep
down
my
voice
and
i
sha
be
here
much
longer
you
know
i
shall
go
home
at
first
my
stepfather
has
written
a
kind
letter
and
of
course
he
glad
to
know
i
shall
marry
cobb
but
i
do
think
the
wedding
will
be
there
it
would
be
nice
to
go
to
church
in
a
rage
as
i
sure
i
should
with
mother
and
cissy
looking
on
this
might
or
might
not
signify
a
revival
of
the
wish
to
be
married
from
emmeline
quickly
passed
to
another
subject
higgins
was
paying
a
visit
to
coburg
lodge
where
during
the
days
of
confusion
the
master
of
the
house
had
been
left
at
his
servants
mercy
on
her
return
late
in
the
evening
she
entered
flurried
and
perspiring
and
asked
the
servant
who
admitted
her
where
mumford
was
master
in
the
library
her
i
wish
to
speak
to
her
at
once
emmeline
came
forth
and
a
lamp
was
lighted
in
the
for
the
had
not
yet
been
restored
to
a
habitable
condition
silent
and
wondering
in
gloomy
resignation
what
new
annoyance
was
prepared
for
her
emmeline
sat
with
eyes
averted
whilst
the
stout
woman
mopped
her
face
and
talked
disconnectedly
of
the
hardships
of
travelling
in
such
weather
as
this
when
at
length
she
reached
her
point
higgins
became
lucid
and
emphatic
heard
things
as
have
made
me
that
angry
i
can
hardly
bear
myself
would
you
believe
that
people
are
trying
to
take
away
my
daughter
character
it
cissy
doing
i
sure
of
it
though
i
have
brought
it
to
her
yet
i
dropped
in
to
see
some
friends
of
ours
i
should
wonder
if
you
know
the
name
jolliffe
a
niece
of
baxter
baxter
lukin
and
you
know
and
she
told
me
in
confidence
what
people
are
saying
as
how
louise
was
to
marry
mr
bowling
but
he
broke
it
off
when
he
found
sort
of
people
she
was
living
here
at
sutton
and
a
great
many
more
things
as
i
should
like
to
tell
you
now
what
you
think
of
emmeline
her
eyes
flashing
broke
in
angrily
think
nothing
at
all
about
it
higgins
and
i
had
very
much
rather
not
hear
the
talk
of
such
people
do
wonder
it
aggravates
you
mumford
did
anyone
ever
hear
such
a
scandal
i
sure
nobody
that
knows
you
could
say
a
word
against
your
respectability
and
as
i
told
jolliffe
quite
at
liberty
to
call
here
or
the
next
day
to
see
i
hope
said
emmeline
must
refuse
just
let
me
tell
you
what
i
thought
pursued
the
stout
lady
hardly
aware
of
this
interruption
have
to
be
set
right
both
for
lou
sake
and
for
yours
and
to
satisfy
us
all
they
making
a
mystery
see
of
lou
leaving
and
going
off
to
live
with
strangers
and
cissy
been
doing
her
best
to
make
people
think
there
something
wrong
the
spiteful
creature
and
there
only
one
way
of
setting
it
right
as
soon
as
lou
can
be
dressed
and
got
down
and
when
the
finished
i
want
her
to
ask
all
our
friends
here
to
five
tea
just
to
let
them
see
with
their
own
eyes
higgins
course
there
be
no
expense
for
mumford
not
a
farthing
i
provide
everything
and
all
i
ask
of
you
is
just
to
sit
in
your
own
higgins
be
so
kind
as
to
listen
to
me
this
is
quite
impossible
i
ca
dream
of
allowing
any
such
thing
the
other
glared
in
astonishment
which
tended
to
wrath
ca
you
see
mumford
that
it
for
your
good
as
well
as
ours
do
you
want
people
to
be
using
your
name
can
it
matter
to
me
how
people
think
or
speak
of
me
cried
emmeline
trembling
with
exasperation
people
i
do
think
you
know
who
you
talking
about
mumford
you
let
me
tell
you
that
my
friends
are
as
respectable
as
yours
shall
not
argue
about
it
said
emmeline
standing
up
will
please
to
remember
that
already
i
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
annoyance
and
what
you
propose
would
be
quite
intolerable
once
for
all
i
ca
dream
of
such
a
thing
all
i
can
say
is
mumford
the
speaker
rose
with
heavy
dignity
you
not
behaving
in
a
very
ladylike
way
i
not
a
quarrelsome
person
as
you
well
know
and
i
do
say
nasty
things
if
i
can
help
it
but
there
one
thing
i
say
and
say
and
that
is
that
when
we
first
came
here
you
gave
a
very
different
account
of
yourself
to
what
it
turned
out
you
told
me
and
my
daughter
distinctly
that
you
had
a
great
deal
of
the
very
best
society
and
that
was
what
lou
came
here
and
you
knew
it
and
you
ca
deny
that
you
did
and
i
should
like
to
know
how
much
society
she
seen
all
the
time
she
been
here
that
the
question
i
you
i
do
believe
she
seen
more
than
three
or
four
people
altogether
they
may
have
been
respectable
enough
and
not
the
one
to
say
they
were
but
i
say
it
is
what
we
was
led
to
expect
and
that
you
ca
deny
mrs
mumford
she
paused
for
breath
emmeline
had
moved
towards
the
door
and
stood
struggling
with
the
feminine
rage
which
impelled
her
to
undignified
altercation
to
withdraw
in
silence
would
be
like
a
shamed
confession
of
the
charge
brought
against
her
and
she
suffered
not
a
little
from
her
consciousness
of
the
modicum
of
truth
therein
was
a
most
unfortunate
thing
higgins
burst
from
her
lips
i
ever
consented
to
receive
your
daughter
knowing
as
i
did
that
she
was
our
social
equal
exclaimed
the
other
as
though
the
suggestion
startled
her
by
its
novelty
think
yourself
superior
to
us
you
did
us
a
favour
whilst
higgins
was
uttering
these
words
the
door
opened
and
there
entered
a
figure
which
startled
her
into
silence
it
was
that
of
louise
in
a
and
slippers
with
a
shawl
wrapped
about
the
upper
part
of
her
body
heard
you
quarrelling
she
began
her
bedroom
was
immediately
above
and
at
this
silent
hour
the
voices
of
the
angry
ladies
had
been
quite
audible
to
her
as
she
lay
in
bed
it
all
about
it
too
bad
of
you
mother
idea
louise
of
coming
down
like
that
cried
her
parent
indignantly
did
you
know
mumford
was
here
for
shame
go
up
again
this
moment
do
see
any
harm
if
mumford
had
been
here
replied
the
girl
calmly
sure
it
most
unwise
of
you
to
leave
your
bed
began
emmeline
with
anxious
thought
for
louise
health
due
probably
to
her
dread
of
having
the
girl
in
the
house
for
an
indefinite
period
i
wrapped
up
i
feel
shaky
that
all
and
i
shall
have
to
sit
down
she
did
so
on
the
nearest
chair
with
a
little
laugh
at
her
strange
feebleness
please
quarrel
you
two
mumford
do
mind
anything
that
mother
says
thereupon
louise
mother
burst
into
a
vehement
exposition
of
the
reasons
of
discord
beginning
with
the
calumnious
stories
she
had
heard
at
jolliffe
and
ending
with
the
outrageous
arrogance
of
mumford
latest
remark
louise
listened
with
a
smile
look
here
mother
she
said
when
silence
came
for
a
moment
ca
expect
mumford
to
have
a
lot
of
strangers
coming
to
the
house
just
on
my
account
she
sick
and
tired
of
us
all
and
wants
to
see
our
backs
as
soon
as
ever
she
can
i
do
say
it
to
offend
you
mumford
but
you
know
it
true
and
i
tell
you
what
it
is
morning
i
going
back
home
yes
i
am
you
ca
stay
here
mother
after
this
and
i
not
going
to
have
anyone
new
to
wait
on
me
i
shall
go
home
in
a
cab
straight
from
this
house
to
the
other
and
i
quite
sure
i
sha
take
any
harm
wo
do
it
till
the
doctor
given
you
leave
said
higgins
with
concern
be
here
at
ten
in
the
morning
and
i
know
he
will
give
me
leave
so
there
an
end
of
it
and
you
can
go
to
bed
and
sleep
in
peace
mrs
mumford
it
was
not
at
all
unamiably
said
but
for
higgins
presence
emmeline
would
have
responded
with
a
certain
kindness
still
smarting
under
the
stout
lady
accusations
which
continued
to
sound
in
sniffs
and
snorts
she
answered
as
austerely
as
possible
must
leave
you
to
judge
miss
derrick
how
soon
you
feel
able
to
go
i
do
wish
you
to
do
anything
imprudent
but
it
will
be
much
better
if
higgins
regards
me
as
a
stranger
during
the
rest
of
her
stay
here
any
communication
she
wishes
to
make
to
me
must
be
made
through
a
servant
having
thus
delivered
herself
emmeline
quitted
the
room
from
the
library
of
which
the
door
was
left
ajar
she
heard
louise
and
her
mother
pass
upstairs
both
silent
mumford
too
well
aware
that
yet
another
disturbance
had
come
upon
his
unhappy
household
affected
to
read
and
it
was
only
when
the
door
of
louise
room
had
closed
that
emmeline
spoke
to
him
higgins
will
breakfast
by
herself
she
said
severely
may
perhaps
go
before
lunch
but
in
any
case
we
shall
not
sit
down
at
table
with
her
again
right
mumford
replied
studiously
refraining
from
any
hint
of
curiosity
so
next
morning
their
breakfast
was
served
in
the
library
higgins
came
down
at
the
usual
hour
found
the
at
her
disposal
and
ate
with
customary
appetite
alone
had
experience
lain
among
the
more
vigorously
vulgar
of
her
sex
she
would
have
marvelled
at
higgins
silence
and
general
during
these
last
hours
louise
mother
might
without
transgressing
the
probabilities
of
the
situation
have
made
this
a
memorable
morning
indeed
she
confined
herself
to
a
rather
frequent
ringing
of
the
bedroom
bell
her
requests
of
the
servants
became
orders
such
as
she
would
have
given
in
a
hotel
or
but
no
distinctly
offensive
word
escaped
her
and
this
was
almost
entirely
due
to
louise
influence
for
the
girl
impressed
upon
her
mother
that
make
a
row
would
be
the
sure
and
certain
way
of
proving
that
mumford
was
justified
in
claiming
social
superiority
over
her
guests
the
doctor
easily
perceiving
how
matters
stood
made
no
difficulty
about
the
patient
removal
in
a
closed
carriage
and
with
exercise
of
all
obvious
precautions
she
might
travel
as
soon
as
she
liked
anticipating
this
higgins
had
already
packed
all
the
luggage
and
louise
as
well
as
it
could
be
managed
had
been
clad
for
the
journey
suppose
you
go
and
order
the
cab
yourself
she
said
to
her
mother
when
they
were
alone
again
i
must
on
account
of
making
a
bargain
about
the
charge
a
nice
expense
you
been
to
us
louise
that
man
ought
to
pay
every
penny
tell
him
you
say
so
and
no
doubt
he
will
they
wrangled
about
this
whilst
higgins
was
dressing
to
go
out
as
soon
as
her
mother
had
left
the
house
louise
stole
downstairs
and
to
the
door
of
the
which
was
half
open
emmeline
her
back
turned
stood
before
the
fireplace
as
if
considering
some
new
plan
of
decoration
she
did
not
hear
the
girl
light
step
whitewashers
and
paperhangers
had
done
their
work
a
new
carpet
was
laid
down
but
pictures
had
still
to
be
restored
to
their
places
and
the
furniture
stood
all
together
in
the
middle
of
the
room
not
till
louise
had
entered
did
her
hostess
look
round
mumford
i
want
to
say
yes
emmeline
answered
civilly
but
without
a
smile
miss
derrick
and
she
stepped
forward
to
shake
hands
be
afraid
said
the
girl
looking
into
her
face
shall
never
see
me
again
unless
you
wish
to
sure
i
wish
you
all
happiness
was
the
embarrassed
reply
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
of
your
marriage
write
to
you
about
it
but
you
wo
talk
unkindly
about
me
when
i
gone
you
and
mr
mumford
no
indeed
we
shall
not
louise
tried
to
say
something
else
but
without
success
she
pressed
emmeline
hand
turned
quickly
and
disappeared
in
time
arrived
the
vehicle
higgins
had
engaged
without
delay
mother
and
daughter
left
the
house
and
were
driven
off
mumford
kept
a
strict
retirement
when
the
two
had
gone
she
learnt
from
the
housemaid
that
their
luggage
would
be
removed
later
in
the
day
a
fortnight
passed
and
the
mumfords
once
more
lived
in
enjoyment
of
tranquillity
though
emmeline
could
not
quite
recover
her
old
self
they
never
spoke
of
the
dread
experiences
through
which
they
had
gone
mumford
holiday
time
approached
and
they
were
making
arrangements
for
a
visit
to
the
seaside
when
one
morning
a
carrier
cart
delivered
a
large
package
unexpected
and
of
unknown
contents
emmeline
stripped
off
the
matting
and
found
a
screen
not
unlike
that
which
she
had
lost
in
the
fire
of
course
it
came
from
louise
and
though
she
professed
herself
very
much
annoyed
mumford
had
no
choice
but
to
acknowledge
it
in
a
civil
little
note
addressed
to
coburg
lodge
they
were
away
from
home
for
three
weeks
on
returning
emmeline
found
a
letter
which
had
arrived
for
her
the
day
before
it
was
from
louise
and
announced
her
marriage
mumford
i
know
you
be
glad
to
hear
it
all
over
it
was
to
have
been
at
the
end
of
october
when
our
house
was
ready
for
us
we
have
taken
a
very
nice
one
at
holloway
but
of
course
something
happened
and
mother
and
cissy
and
i
quarrelled
so
dreadfully
that
i
went
off
and
took
a
lodging
and
then
tom
said
that
we
must
be
married
at
once
and
so
we
were
without
any
fuss
at
all
and
i
think
it
was
ever
so
much
better
though
some
girls
would
not
care
to
go
in
their
plain
dress
and
without
friends
or
anything
after
it
was
over
tom
and
i
had
just
a
little
disagreement
about
something
but
of
course
he
gave
way
and
i
do
think
we
shall
get
on
together
at
all
badly
my
stepfather
has
been
very
nice
and
is
paying
for
all
the
furniture
and
has
promised
me
a
lot
of
things
of
course
he
is
delighted
to
see
me
out
of
the
house
just
as
you
were
you
see
that
i
write
from
broadstairs
where
we
are
spending
our
honeymoon
please
remember
me
to
mumford
and
believe
me
very
sincerely
yours
