life
consists
not
of
a
series
of
illustrious
actions
the
greater
part
of
our
time
passes
in
compliance
with
necessities
in
the
performance
of
daily
duties
in
the
removal
of
small
inconveniences
in
the
procurement
of
petty
pleasures
and
we
are
well
or
ill
at
ease
as
the
main
stream
of

glides
on

the

the

of

worthy

require
no
further
introduction
to
the
reader
the
almost
exceptional
position
which
they
occupy
as
satirizing
the
foibles
rather
than
the
more
serious
faults
of
human
nature
and
the
caustic
character
of
that
satire
mingled
with
such
bright
wit
and
genial
humour
give
miss
ferrier
a
place
to
herself
in
english
fiction
and
it
is
felt
that
a
time
has
come
to
recognize
this
by
producing
her
works
in
a
form
which
fits
them
for
the
library
and
in
a
type
which

novels
in
november
there
died
in
edinburgh
one
who
might
with
truth
be
called
almost
the
last
if
not
the
last
of
that
literary
galaxy
that
adorned
edinburgh
society
in
the
days
of
scott
jeffrey

and

distinguished
by
the
friendship
and
confidence

scott
the
name
of
susan
edmonstone
ferrier
is
one
that
has
become
famous
from
her
three
clever
satirical
and
most
amusing
novels
of
the
inheritance
and
they
exhibit
besides
a
keen
sense
of
the
ludicrous
almost
unequalled
she
may
be
said
to
have
done
for
scotland
what
jane
austen
and
maria
edgeworth
have
respectively
done
for
england
and
ireland
left
portraits
painted
in
undying
colours
of
men
and
women
that
will
live
for
ever
in
the
hearts
and
minds
of
her
readers
in
the
present
redundant
age
of
novel
writers
and
and
when
one
would
suppose
the
supply
must
far
exceed
the
demand
from
the
amount
of
puerile
and
often
at
the
same
time
prurient
literature
in
the
department
of
fiction
that
daily
flows
from
the
press
it
is
refreshing
to
turn
to
the
vigorous
and
above
all
healthy
moral
tone
of
this
lady
works
to
the
present
generation
they
are
as
if
they
had
never
been
and
to
the
question
did
you
ever
read
it
is
not
uncommon
in

to
get
such
an
answer
as
no

and
died
there
an
introduction
had
been
requested
for
the
first
of
these
three
works
but
while
the
author
was
considering
what
could
be
said
for
an
already
tale
it
had
passed
through
the
press
with
such
rapidity
as
to
outstrip
all
consideration
indeed
what
can
be
said
for
any
of
them
amounts
to
so
little
it
is
scarcely
worth
saying
at
all
the
first
was
begun
at
the
urgent
desire
of
a
friend
and
with
the
promise
of
assistance
which
however
failed
long
before
the
end
of
the
first
volume
the
work
was
then
thrown
aside
and
resumed
some
years
after
it
afforded
occupation
and
amusement
for
idle
and
solitary
hours
and
was
published
in
the
belief
that
the
author
name
never
would
be
guessed
at
or
the
work
heard
of
beyond
a
very
limited
sphere
que
le
premier
pas
in
as
in
carrying
one
head
in
their
hand
and
as
matters
of
course
it
has
been
so
often
and
confidently
asserted
that
almost
all
the
characters
are
individual
portraits
that
the
author
has
little
hope
of
being
believed
when
she
asserts
the
contrary
that
some
of
them
were
sketched
from
life
is
not
denied
but
the
circumstances
in
which
they
are
placed
their
birth
habits
language
and
a
thousand
minute
particulars
differ
so
widely
from
the
originals
as
ought
to
refute
the
charge
of
personality
with
regard
to
the
introduction
of
religious
sentiment
into
works
of
fiction
there
exists
a
difference
of
opinion
which
in
the
absence
of
any
authoritative
command
leaves
each
free
to
act
according
to
their
own
feelings
and
opinions
viewing
this
life
merely
as
the
prelude
to
another
state
of
existence
it
does
seem
strange
that
the
future
should
ever
excluded
from
any
representation
of
it
even
in
its
motley
occurrences
scarcely
less
motley
perhaps
than
the
human
mind
itself
the
author
can
only
wish
it
had
been
her
province
to
have
raised
plants
of
nobler
growth
in
the
wide
field
of
christian
literature
but
as
such
has
not
been
her
high
calling
she
hopes
her
herbs
of
grace
may
without
offence
be
allowed
to
put
forth
their
blossoms
amongst
the
briars
weeds
and
wild
flowers
of
life
common
path
it
underwent
several
changes
before
its
final
publication
in
edinburgh
the
friend
on
whose
assistance
she
relied
was
miss
clavering
daughter
of
lady
augusta
clavering
and
niece
of
the
late
duke
of
argyll
between
this
lady
and
our
author
an
early
friendship
existed
which
was
severed
only
by
death
it
commenced
in
when
miss
ferrier
lost
her
mother
and
when
she
went
with
her
father
to
inveraray
castle
she
was
then
fifteen
and
her
friend
only
eight
miss
clavering
became
the
wife
of
mr
miles
fletcher
advocate
but
was
better
known
in
later
years
as
christison
she
inherited
all
the
natural
elegance
and
beauty
of
face
and
form
for
which
her
mother
and
aunt
lady
charlotte
campbell
were
so
distinguished
and
died
at
edinburgh
at
an
advanced
age
while
concocting
the
story
of
her
first
novel
miss
ferrier
writes
to
her
friend
in
a
lively
and
sprightly
vein
ferrier
coutts
was
the
daughter
of
a
farmer
at
gourdon
near
montrose
she
was
very
amiable
and
possessed
of
great
personal
beauty
as
is
attested
by
her
portrait
by
sir
george
chalmers
in
a
fancy
dress
and
painted
at
the
time
of
her
marriage
she
resided

and

your
proposals
flatter
and
delight
me
but
how
in
the
name
of
postage
are
we
to
transport
our
brains
to
and
fro
i
suppose
we
be
pawning
our
flannel
petticoats
to
bring
about
our
heroine
marriage
and
lying
on
straw
to
give
her
christian
burial
part
of
your
plot
i
like
much
some
not
quite
so
well
for
example
it
wants
a
your
principal
characters
are
good
and
interesting
and
they
are
tormented
and
persecuted
and
punished
from
no
fault
of
their
own
and
for
no
possible
purpose
now
i
do
think
like
all
manufacturers
that
is
absolutely
necessary
that
the
good
boys
and
girls
should
be
rewarded
and
the
naughty
ones
punished
yet
i
think
where
there
is
much
tribulation
is
fitter
it
should
be
the
rather
than
the
of
misconduct
or
frailty
you
say
that
rule
is
absurd
inasmuch
as
it
is
not
observed
in
human
life
that
i
allow
but
we
know
the
inflictions
of
providence
are
for
wise
purposes
therefore
our
reason
willingly
submits
to
them
but
as
the
only
good
purpose
of
a
book
is
to
inculcate
morality
and
convey
some
lesson
of
instruction
as
well
as
delight
i
do
not
see
that
what
is
called
a
can
be
dispensed
with
in
a
work
of
fiction
another
fault
is
your
making
your
hero
attempt
suicide
which
is
greatly
too
shocking
and
destroys
all
the
interest
his
misfortunes
would
otherwise
excite
that
however
could
be
easily
altered
and
in
other
respects
i
think
your
plot
has
great
merit
you
perhaps
be
displeased
at
the
freedom
of
my
remarks
but
in
the
first
place
freedom
is
absolutely
necessary
in
the
cause
in
which
we
are
about
to
embark
and
it
must
be
understood
to
be
one
if
not
the
chief
article
of
our
creed
in
the
second
though
it
should
have
been
the
first
know
that
i
always
say
what
i
think
or
say
nothing
now
as
to
my
own
deeds
i
shall
make
no
apologies
since
they
must
be
banished
from
our
code
of
laws
for
sending
you
a
hasty
and
imperfect
sketch
of
what
i
think
might
be
wrought
up
to
a
tolerable
form
i
do
not
recollect
ever
to
have
seen
the
sudden
transition
of
a
english
beauty
who
thinks
she
can
sacrifice
all
for
love
to
an
uncomfortable
solitary
highland
dwelling
among
tall
sisters
and
aunts
do
you
think
this
would
make
a
good
opening
of
the
piece
suppose
each
of
us
try
our
hands
on
it
the
moral
to
be
deduced
from
that
is
to
warn
all
young
ladies
against
runaway
matches
and
the
character
and
fate
of
the
two
sisters
would
be
i
expect
it
will
be
the
first
book
every
wise
matron
will
put
into
the
hand
of
her
daughter
and
even
the
reviewers
will
relax
of
their
severity
in
favour
of
the
morality
of
this
little
work
enchanting
sight
already
do
i
behold
myself
arrayed
in
an
old
mouldy
covering
thumbed
and
creased
and
filled
with
i
hear
the
enchanting
sound
of
some
sentimental
miss
the
shrill
pipe
of
some
antiquated
spinster
or
the
hoarse
grumbling
of
some
incensed
dowager
as
they
severally
inquire
for
me
at
the
circulating
library
and
are
assured
by
the
master
that
is
in
such
demand
that
though
he
has
thirteen
copies
they
are
insufficient
to
answer
the
calls
upon
it
but
that
each
of
them
may
depend
upon
having
the
very
first
that
comes
in

child
you
had
need
be
sensible
of
the
value
of
my
correspondence

this
moment
i
squandering
mines
of
wealth
upon
you
when
i
might
be
drawing
treasures
from

i
shall
not
repine
if
you
only
repay
me
in
kind
speedy
and
long
is
all
that
i
require
for
all
things
else
i
shall
take
my
chance
though
i
have
been
so
impertinent
to
your
book
i
nevertheless
hope
and
expect
you
send
it

me
combie
and
his
daughter
or
mare
as
you
call
her
are
coming
to
town
about
this
time
as
i
informed
and
you
may
easily
contrive
to
catch
them
wild
as
they
are
and
send
it
by
them
for
there
no
judging
what
a
picture
will
be
like
from
a
mere
outline
if
that
wo
do
is
there
not
a
coach
or
a
carrier
one
thing
let
me
entreat
of
you
if
we
engage
in
this
undertaking
let
it
be
kept
a
profound
secret
from
every
human
being
if
i
was
suspected
of
being
accessory
to
such
foul
deeds
my
brothers
and
sisters
would
murder
me
and
my
father
bury
me
alive
and
i
have
always
observed
that
if
a
secret
ever
goes
beyond
those
immediately
concerned
in
its
concealment
it
very
soon
ceases
to
be
a
secret

this
sketch
of
a
solitary
highland
dwelling
again
she
writes
to
her
friend
and
copartner
in
her
literary
work
i
am
boiling
to
hear
from
you
but
i
taken
a
remorse
of
conscience
about
lady
maclaughlan
and
her
friends
if
i
was
ever
to
be
detected
or
even
suspected
i
would
have
nothing
for
it
but
to
drown
myself
i
mean
therefore
to
let
her
alone
till
i
hear
from
you
as
i
think
we
might
compound
some
other
kind
of
character
for
her
that
might
do
as
well
and
not
be
so
dangerous
as
to
the

it
was

of
all
i
must
tell
you
that
i
approve
in
the
most
signal
manner
of
lady

the
sort
of
character
was
totally
unexpected
by
me
and
i
was
really
transported
with
her
do
i
know
the
person

dress
was
vastly
like

the
manners

not

a
touch
at
her
i
love

it
is
impossible

presence
of
his
lady
to
have
eyes
or
ears
for
anyone
else
now
you
must
not
think
of
altering
her
and
it
must
all
go
forth
in
the
world
neither
must
the
misses
upon
any
account
be
changed
i
have
a
way
now
of
at
least
offering
it
to
publication
by
which
you
never
can
be
discovered
i
will
tell
the
person
that
i
wrote
it
indeed
quothà
cries
miss
ferrier
and
no
great
favour
see
how
she
loves
to
plume
herself
with
borrowed
fame
well
however
my
way
is
quite
sure
and
the
person
would
never
think
of
speaking
of
it
again
so
never
let
the
idea
of
detection
come
across
your
brain
while
you
are
writing
to
damp
your
ardour
daughter
of
general
seymour
conway
and
a
distinguished
sculptor
she
was
niece
of
the
fifth
duke
of
argyll
lady
frederick
campbell
is
believed
to
have
suggested
the
character
of
lady
maclaughlan
to
miss
ferrier
and
there
is
little
doubt
she
was
the
original
she
was
the
widow
of
earl
ferrel
of
tyburn
notoriety
and
was
burnt
to
death
at
coombe
bank
in
positively
neither
sir
sampson
lady
nor
the
foolish
virgins
must
be
displaced
again
she
writes
from
inveraray
castle
of
date
december
eight
years
before
the
work
was
published
and
now
my
dear
susannah
i
must
tell
you
of
the
success
of
your
i
read
it
to
lady
charlotte
in
the
carriage
when
she
and
i
came
together
from
ardencaple
bessie
having
gone
with
mamma
if
you
will
believe
i
never
yet
in
my
existence
saw
lady
laugh
so
much
as
she
did
at
that
from
beginning
to
end
and
seriously
i
was
two
or
three
times
afraid
that
she
would
fall
into
a
fit
her
very
words
were
assure
you
i
think
it
without
the
least
exception
the
cleverest
thing
that
ever
was
written
and
in
wit
far
surpassing
fielding
then
she
said
as
to
our
other
books
they
would
all
sink
to
nothingness
before
yours
that
they
were
not
fit
to
be
mentioned
in
the
same
day
and
that
she
felt
quite
discouraged
from
writing
when
she
thought
of
yours
the
whole
conversation
of
the
aunties
made
her
screech
with
laughing
and
in
short
i
can
neither
record
nor
describe
all
that
she
said
far
from
exaggerating
it
i
do
say
half
enough
but
i
only
wish
you
had
seen
the
effect
it
produced
i
am
sure
you
will
be
the
first
author
of
the
age
lady
charlotte
campbell
her
aunt
better
known
latterly
as
lady
charlotte
bury
and
celebrated
for
her
beauty
and
accomplishments
miss
mure
of
caldwell
these
oddities
were
the
three
misses
edmonstone
of
the
duntreath
family
and
old
family
friends
after
one
of
whom
miss
ferrier
was
named
in
another
letter
she
writes
i
had
an
immense
packet
from
lady
the
other
day
which
i
confess
rather
disappointed
me
for
i
expected
volumes
of
new
compositions
on
opening
it
what
should
it
prove
but
your
book
returned
so
i
shall
keep
it
safe
till
i
see
you
she
was
profuse
in
its
praises
and
so
was
mamma
who
said
she
was
particularly
taken
with
lady
juliana
brother
he
was
so
like
the
duke
lady
said
she
had
read
it
all
deliberately
and
critically
and
pronounced
it
with
a
dash
under
it
lady
begs
that
in
your
enumeration
of
lady
peccadilloes
you
will
omit
waltzes
lord
courtland
that
dance
had
just
been
introduced
in
london
and
the
season
of
that
year
miss
clavering
spent
with
her
aunt
lady
charlotte
in
the
metropolis
in
a
round
of
gaiety
going
to
parties
at
kensington
palace
where
the
princess
of
wales
then
lived
devonshire
house
and
the
witty
duchess
of
gordon
one
of
the
empresses
of
fashion
as
walpole
calls
her
of
waltzes
she
writes
to
miss
ferrier
lady
charlotte
was
one
of
the
princess
they
are
all
of
a
sudden
become
so
much
the
rage
here
that
people
meet
in
the
morning
at
one
another
houses
to
learn
them
and
they
are
getting
on
very
much
lady
charlotte
and
i
get
great
honour
for
the
accomplishment
and
i
have
improved
a
few
scholars
clanronald
is
grown
so
detestably
fine
he
waltzes
with
me
because
he
thinks
he
thereby
shows
off
his
figure
but
as
to
speaking
to
me
or
lady
charlotte
he
thinks
himself
much
above
that
he
is
in
much
request
at
present
because
of
his
dancing
next
to
him
lord
hartington
is
i
think
the
best
dancer
he
is
besides
very
fond
of
it
and
is
much
above
being
fine
i
never
met
with
a
more
natural
boyish
creature
macdonald
of
clanronald
a
great
beau
in
the
fashionable
london
world
to
return
to
the
novel
the
only
portion
from
miss
clavering
pen
is
the
history
of
douglas
in
the
first
volume
and
are
as
she
herself
remarked
the
only
few
pages
that
will
be
skipped
she
further
adds
make
haste
and
print
it
then
lest
one
of
the
miss
edmonstones
should
die
as
then
i
should
think
you
would
scarce
venture
for
fear
of
being
haunted
i
shall
hasten
to
burn
your
last
letter
as
you
mention
something
of
looking
out
for
a
father
for
your
so
i
do
think
it
would
be
decent
to
let
anybody
get
a
sight
of
such
a
letter
at
last
in
the
novel
was
published
by
the
late
blackwood
and
drew
forth
loud
plaudits
from
the
wondering
public
as
to
who
the
author
of
so
original
a
book
could
be
in
london
it
is
much
admired
and
generally
attributed
to
walter
scott
so
writes
a
friend
to
miss
ferrier
and
she
replies
in
her
humorous
style
whosever
it
is
i
have
met
with
nothing
that
has
interested
me
since
sir
walter
must
have
been
flattered
at
his
being
supposed
its
father
for
he
says
in
the
conclusion
of
the
of
my
there
remains
behind
not
only
a
large
harvest
but
labourers
capable
of
gathering
it
in
more
than
one
writer
has
of
late
displayed
talents
of
this
description
and
if
the
present
author
himself
a
phantom
may
be
permitted
to
distinguish
a
brother
or
perhaps
a
sister
shadow
he
would
mention
in
particular
the
author
of
the
very
lively
work
entitled
blackwood
whose
opinion
is
of
some
value
thought
very
highly
of
and
he
writes
to
miss
ferrier
will
not
allow
himself
to
think
for
one
moment
that
there
can
be
any
uncertainty
as
to
the
work
being
completed
not
to
mention
his
own
deep
disappointment
would
almost
consider
it
a
crime
if
a
work
possessing
so
much
interest
and
useful
instruction
were
not
given
to
the
world
the
author
is
the
only
critic
of
whom
is
afraid
and
after
what
he
has
said
he
anxiously
hopes
that
this
censor
of
the
press
will
very
speedily
affix
the
in
allusion
to
sir
walter
eulogium
on
the
novel
above
quoted
blackwood
writes
to
the
author
i
have
the
pleasure
of
enclosing
you
this
concluding
sentence
of
the
new
of
my
landlord
which
are
to
be
published
after
this
call
surely
you
will
be
no
longer
silent
if
the
great
magician
does
not
conjure
you
i
shall
give
up
all
hopes
but
miss
ferrier
seems
to
have
been
proof
against
the
great
magician
even
became
deservedly
popular
and
was
translated
into
french
as
appears
from
the
annexed
we
perceive
by
the
french
papers
that
a
translation
of
miss
clever
novel
has
been
very
successful
in
france
for
she
received
the
sum
of
her
second
venture
was
more
successful
in
a
pecuniary
sense
space
however
prohibits
me
from
dwelling
any
longer
on
so
we
come
next
to
this
novel
appeared
six
years
after
in
and
is
a
work
of
very
great
merit
to
her
sister
kinloch
in
london
miss
ferrier
writes
john
her
brother
has
now
completed
a
bargain
with
blackwood
by
which
i
am
to
have
for
a
novel
now
in
hand
but
which
is
not
nearly
finished
and
possibly
never
may
be
nevertheless
he
is
desirous
of
announcing
it
in
his
magazine
and
therefore
i
wish
to
prepare
you
for
the
i
can
say
nothing
more
than
i
have
already
said
on
the
subject
of
if
not
of
secrecy
i
never
will
avow
myself
and
nothing
can
hurt
and
offend
me
so
much
as
any
of
my
friends
doing
it
for
me
this
is
not
but
my
real
and
unalterable
feeling
i
could
not
bear
the
fuss
of
authorism
secrecy
as
to
her
authorship
seems
to
have
been
the
great
desire
of
her
heart
and
much
of
was
written
in
privacy
at
morningside
house
old
ferrier
summer
retreat
near
edinburgh
and
she
says
this
house
is
so
small
it
is
very
for
concealment
it
was
not
till
that
she
publicly
avowed
herself
by
authorising
her
name
to
be
prefixed
to
a
revised
and
corrected
edition
of
her
works
sir
walter
scott
was
delighted
with
this
second
novel
a
proof
of
which
was
conveyed
to
miss
ferrier
by
blackwood
published
by
the
late
richard
bentley
to
whom
she
sold
her
copyrights
in
a
previous
edition
was
published
by
him
in
on
wednesday
i
dined
in
company
with
sir
walter
scott
and
he
spoke
of
the
work
in
the
very
highest
terms
i
do
not
always
set
the
highest
value
on
the
baronet
favourable
opinion
of
a
book
because
he
has
so
much
kindness
of
feeling
towards
everyone
but
in
this
case
he
spoke
so
much
amore
and
entered
so
completely
and
at
such
a
length
to
me
into
the
spirit
of
the
book
and
of
the
characters
that
showed
me
at
once
the
impression
it
had
made
on
him
everyone
i
have
seen
who
has
seen
the
book
gives
the
some
praise
of
it
two
or
three
days
ago
i
had
a
note
from
a
friend
which
i
copy
have
nearly
finished
a
volume
of
it
is
unquestionably
the
best
novel
of
the
class
of
the
present
day
in
so
far
as
i
can
yet
judge
lord
rossville
adam
ramsay
bell
black
and
the
major
miss
pratt
and
anthony
whyte
are
capital
and
a
fine
contrast
to
each
other
it
is
i
think
a
more
elaborate
work
than
better
told
with
greater
variety
and
displaying
improved
powers
i
congratulate
you
and
have
no
doubt
the
book
will
make
a
prodigious
sensation
blackwood
adds
i
do
not
know
a
better
judge
nor
a
more
frank
and
honest
one
than
the
writer
of
this
note
again
he
writes
on
saturday
i
lent
in
confidence
to
a
very
clever
friend
on
whose
discretion
i
can
rely
the
two
volumes
of
this
morning
i
got
them
back
with
the
following
note
dear
sir
i
am
truly
delighted
with
i
do
not
find
as
yet
any
one
character
quite
equal
to
redgill
except
perhaps
the
or
troubled
i
ca
make
out
which
maiden
but
as
a
novel
it
is
a
hundred
miles
above
it
reminds
me
of
miss
austen
very
best
things
in
every
page
and
if
the
third
volume
be
like
these
no
fear
of
success
triumphant
in
the
gourmet
physician
to
lord
courtland
and
the
living
portrait
of
hundreds
though
never
before
hit
off
so
well
miss
becky
duguid
blackwood
again
says
you
have
only
to
go
on
as
you
are
going
to
sustain
the
character
sir
walter
gave
me
of
that
you
had
the
rare
talent
of
making
your
conclusion
even
better
than
your
commencement
for
said
this
worthy
and
veracious
person
blackwood
if
ever
i
were
to
write
a
novel
i
would
like
to
write
the
two
first
volumes
and
leave
anybody
to
write
the
third
that
liked
in
the
following
note
lister
author
of
also
expresses
his
admiration
in
graceful
terms
and
with
a
copy
of
his
own
novel
for
miss
ferrier
acceptance
lister
to
miss
heriot
row
my
dear
madam
i
should
feel
that
in
requesting
your
acceptance
of
the
book
which
accompanies
this
note
i
should
be
presuming
too
much
upon
the
very
short
time
that
i
have
had
the
honour
of
being
known
to
you
if
lister
had
not
told
me
that
you
had
kindly
spoken
of
it
in
approving
terms
i
hope
therefore
i
may
be
allowed
without
presumption
to
present
to
you
a
book
which
you
have
thus
raised
in
the
opinion
of
its
writer
and
the
composition
of
which
is
associated
in
my
mind
with
the
recollection
of
one
of
the
greatest
pleasure
i
have
derived
from
for
which
i
am
indebted
to
you
i
believe
the
only
novel
i
read
or
at
any
rate
can
now
remember
to
have
read
during
the
whole
time
i
was
writing
was
your
believe
me
my
dear
madam
your
very
faithful
h
lister
from
lister
afterwards
lady
theresa
cornewall
lewis
miss
ferrier
also
received
the
following
complimentary
note
lister
to
miss
heriot
row
my
dear
miss
ferrier
i
can
not
leave
edinburgh
without
a
grateful
acknowledgment
of
your
very
kind
and
flattering
gift
lister
called
upon
you
in
hopes
of
being
able
to
wish
you
and
to
tell
you
in
person
how
much
we
were
pleased
with
the
proof
you
have
given
us
that
we
are
not
unworthy
of
enjoying
and
appreciating
your
delightful
works
pray
accept
our
very
best
thanks
and
i
hope
as
you
will
not
feel
offended
if
i
say
that
they
will
now
have
an
added
charm
in
our
eyes
from
the
regard
which
our
personal
acquaintance
with
the
writer
has
engendered
i
knew
that
to
those
who
do
not
mix
much
in
society
the
acquaintance
with
strangers
is
often
irksome
we
therefore
feel
the
more
obliged
to
you
for
having
allowed
us
the
pleasure
of
knowing
you
and
i
hope
that
if
we
return
in
the
course
of
the
year
that
we
may
find
you
less
suffering
in
health
but
as
kindly
disposed
to
receive
our
visits
as
you
have
hitherto
been
we
feel
very
grateful
for
all
the
kindness
we
have
met
with
in
edinburgh
and
amongst
the
pleasant
reminiscences
of
the
last
five
months
we
must
always
rank
high
the
having
received
from
you
as
a
token
of
regard
so
acceptable
a
believe
me
or
indeed
i
ought
to
say
us
my
dear
miss
ferrier
yours
most
sincerely

judge
writes
to
a
mutual
friend
of
his
and
miss
ferrier
miss
walker
of
dalry
i
received
a
copy
of
in
the
name
of
the
author
and
as
i
do
not
know
who
the
is
and
i
suspect
that
you
know
more
than
i
do
trust
you
will
find
some
channel
through
which
you
will
convey
my
thanks
i
read
with
very
great
pleasure
the
characters
are
very
well
conceived
and
delineated
with
great
success
i
may
add
i
have
heard
it
highly
commended
by
much
better
judges
jeffrey
speaks
very
favourably
he
is
particularly
pleased
with
the
nabob
major
and
spouse
the
letter
from
the
lakes
and
the
to
it
lord
gwydyr
who
lives
entirely
in
fashionable
circles
said
to
me
much
in
its
praise
in
which
i
concurred
from
many
other
symptoms
i
have
no
doubt
of
its
complete
success
miss

mackenzie
daughter
of

man
of
feeling
writes
to
her
friend
miss
ferrier
walter
scott
dined
here
the
other
day
and
both
he
and
papa
joined
heartily
in
their
admiration
of
uncle
adam
and
their
wish
to
know
who
he
is
sir
also
admires
miss
becky
duguid
and
said
he
thought
her
quite
a
new
character
i
should
like
very
much
to
see
you
and
talk
all
over
at
length
but
fear
to
invite
you
to
my
own
bower
for
fear
of
suspicion
but
i
trust
you
will
soon
come
boldly
and
face
my
whole
family
i
do
not
think
you
need
fear
them
much
of
course
like
other
people
they
have
their
thoughts
but
by
no
means
speak
with
certainty
and
margaret
has
this
minute
assured
us
that
she
does
think
it
miss
ferrier
uncle
adam
with
his
seventy
thousand
pounds
and
as
cross
as
two
sticks
in
some
degree
resembled
old
ferrier
who
was
somewhat
brusque
and
testy
in
his
manner
and
alarmed
many
people
who

and
honesty
of
his
character
miss
becky
is
a
poor
old
maid
saddled
with
commissions
from
all
her
friends
of
a
most
miscellaneous
description
she
was
expected
to
attend
all
christenings
deaths
chestings
and
burials
but
she
was
seldom
asked
to
a
marriage
and
never
to
any

pleasure

admirable

pratt

inseparable

invisible
nephew

sort
of
female
paul

turning
up
at
the
most
unexpected
moment
at
lord
rossville
and
finally
puts
the
finishing
stroke
to
the
pompous
old
peer

driving
up
to
his
castle
door
in
the
hearse
of
the
radical

unable
to
procure
any
other
mode
of

that
she
fancied
she
was
the

what
can
i
say
sufficiently
to
express
my
thanks
either
to
you
my
dear
miss
ferrier
or
to
the
of
inheritance
whoever
she
may
be
for
the
most
perfect
edition
of
that
book
that
was
ever
written
and
now
that
i
may
be
allowed
to
have
my
i
shall
read
it
again
with
double
pleasure
it
was
so
kind
of
you
to
remember
your
promise
when
i
received
your
kind
letter
and
books
this
morning
i
was
quite
delighted
with
my
beautiful
present
and
to
find
i
was
not
forgotten
by
one
of
my
best
friends
a
fact
not
generally
known
was
dramatised
and
produced
at
covent
garden
but
had
a
very
short
run
and
was
an
utter
failure
as
might
have
been
expected
gore
was
requested
to
adapt
it
for
the
stage
by
the
chief
comic
actors
of
the
day
and
she
writes
to
miss
ferrier
on
the
subject
since
the
management
of
covent
garden
theatre
fell
into
the
hands
of
laporte
he
has
favoured
me
with
a
commission
to
write
a
comedy
for
him
and
the
subject
proposed
by
him
is
again
the
french
novel
of
which
turns
out
to
be
a
literal
translation
of
he
is
quite
bent
upon
having
miss
pratt
on
the
stage
i
have
not
chosen
to
give
monsieur
laporte
any
positive
answer
on
the
subject
without
previously
applying
to
yourself
to
know
whether
you
have
any
intention
or
inclination
to
apply
to
the
stage
those
admirable
talents
which
are
so
greatly
appreciated
in
london
gore
meanwhile
had
been
forestalled
in
her
attempt
as
a
play
on
the
subject
had
been
laid
before
the
reader
to
covent
garden
and
she
writes
again
to
miss
ferrier
i
have
since
learned
with
regret
that
the
play
is
the
production
of
a
certain
fitzball
the
distinguished
author
of
the
dutchman
an
sixty
other
successful
melodramas
represented
with
great
applause
at
the
surrey
coburg
city
and
pavilion
theatres
etc
in
short
a
writer
of
a
very
low
class
the
play
of
has
been
accepted
at
covent
garden
but
from
my
knowledge
of
the
general
engagements
of
the
theatre
i
should
say
that
it
has
not
the
slightest
chance
of
approaching
to
representation
for
your
sake
it
can
not
be
better
than
in
the
of
the
manager
room
which
secures
it
at
least
from
performance
at
the
coburg
theatre
we
must
let
the
curtain
so
to
speak
drop
on
inheritance
and
pass
on
to
this
novel
also
appeared
six
years
after
in
and
was
dedicated
to
sir
walter
scott
and
he
acknowledges
the
compliment
as
follows
walter
scott
to
miss
my
dear
miss
ferrier
ann
returned
and
part
of
her
edinburgh
news
informs
me
that
you
meditated
honouring
your
present
literary
offspring
with
my
name
so
i
do
not
let
the
sun
set
without
saying
how
much
i
shall
feel
myself
obliged
and
honoured
by
such
a
compliment
i
will
not
stand
bandying
compliments
on
my
want
of
merit
but
can
swallow
so
great
a
compliment
as
if
i
really
deserved
it
and
indeed
as
whatever
i
do
not
owe
entirely
to
your
goodness
i
may
safely
set
down
to
your
friendship
i
shall
scarce
be
more
flattered
one
way
or
the
other
i
hope
you
will
make
good
some
hopes
which
make
ann
very
proud
of
visiting
abbotsford
about
april
next
nothing
can
give
the
proprietor
more
pleasure
for
the
birds
which
are
a
prodigious
chorus
are
making
of
their
nests
and
singing
in
blithe
chorus
come
and
do
not
make
this
a
flattering
dream
i
know
a
little
the
value
of
my
future
godchild
since
i
had
a
peep
at
some
of
the
sheets
when
i
was
in
town
during
the
great
snowstorm
which
out
of
compassion
for
an
author
closed
up
within
her
gates
may
prove
an
apology
for
his
breach
of
confidence
so
far
i
must
say
that
what
i
have
seen
has
had
the
greatest
effect
in
making
me
curious
for
the
rest
believe
me
dear
miss
ferrier
with
the
greatest
respect
your
most
sincere
humble
servant

next

acknowledges
a

sent
him
by
the
author
walter
scott
to
miss
dear
miss
ferrier
if
i
had
a
spark
of
gratitude
in
me
i
ought
to
have
written
you
a
month
ago
to
thank
you
in
no
common
fashion
for
which
by
the
few
and
at
the
same
time
the
probability
of
its
incidents
your
writings
are
those
of
the
first
person
of
genius
who
has
disarmed
the
little
pedantry
of
the
court
of
cupid
and
of
gods
and
men
and
allowed
youths
and
maidens
to
propose
other
alliances
than
those
an
early
choice
had
pointed
out
to
them
i
have
not
time
to
tell
you
all
the
consequences
of
my
revolutionary
doctrine
all
these
we
will
talk
over
when
you
come
here
which
i
am
rejoiced
to
hear
is
likely
to
be
on
saturday
next
when
cadell
will
be
happy
to
be
your
beau
in
the
blucher
and
we
will
take
care
are
met
with
at
the
toll
pray
do
not
make
this
a
flattering
dream
you
are
of
the
initiated
so
will
not
be
with
i
am
always
with
the
greatest
respect
and
regard

writes
to
her
sister
kinloch
in
london
alas
the
night
cometh
when
no
man
can
work
as
is
the
case
with
that
mighty
genius
which
seems
now
completely
quenched
well
might
he
be
styled
bright
and
benignant
luminary
for
while
all
will
deplore
the
loss
of
that
bright
intellect
which
has
so
long
charmed
a
world
many
will
still
more
deeply
lament
the
warm
and
steady
friend
whose
kind
and
genuine
influence
was
ever
freely
diffused
on
all
whom
it
could
benefit
i
trust
however
he
may
be
spared
yet
awhile
it
might
be
salutary
to
himself
to
con
over
the
lessons
of
a
and
it
might
be
edifying
to
others
to
have
his
record
added
to
the
many
that
have
gone
before
him
that
all
below
is
vanity
but
till
we
that
we
shall
never
believe
it
i
to
feel
it
more
than
most
people
as
i
sit
in
my
dark
and
solitary
chamber
shut
out
as
it
seems
from
all
the
of
life
but
alas
worldly
things
make
their
way
into
the
darkest
and
most
solitary
recesses
for
their

in
the
heart
and
from
thence
god
only
can
expel

her
first
visit
to
the
author

was
in
the
autumn
of
when
she
accompanied
her
father
to
ashestiel
the
invitation
came
from
scott
to
ferrier
scott
to
james
ferrier
my
dear
sir
we
are
delighted
to
see
that
your
feet
are
free
and
disposed
to
turn
themselves
our
way
a
pleasure
which
we
can
not
consent
to
put
off
till
we
have
a
house
at
abbotsford
which
is
but
a
distant
prospect
we
are
quite
disengaged
and
alone
saving
the
company
of
terry
the
comedian
who
is
assisting
me
in
planning
my
cottage
having
been
bred
an
architect
under
wyat
he
reads
to
us
after
coffee
in
the
evening
which
is
very
pleasant
this
letter
will
reach
you
so
probably
may
be
a
convenient
day
of
march
when
we
shall
expect
you
to
dinner
about
five
unless
the
weather
should
be
very
stormy
in
which
case
we
should
be
sorry
miss
ferrier
should
risk
getting
cold
is
clearing
up
after
a
week
dismal
weather
which
may
entitle
us
to
expect
some
pleasant
october
days
not
the
worst
of
our
climate
the
road
is
by
middleton
and
bankhouse
we
are
ten
miles
from
the
last
stage
and
thirty
from
edinburgh
hilly
road
there
is
a
ford
beneath
ashestiel
generally
very
passable
but
we
will
have
the
boat
in
readiness
in
case
miss
ferrier
prefers
it
or
the
water
should
be
full
scott
joins
in
kind
respects
to
miss
ferrier
and
i
ever
am
dear
sir
yours
truly
obliged
scott
ashestiel
it
was
in
that
scott
was
appointed
a
clerk
of
session
and
to
ferrier
he
was
in
some
measure
indebted
for
that
post
her
last
visit
to
abbotsford
is
touchingly
alluded
to
by
lockhart
in
his
of
scott
to
assist
them
in
amusing
him
in
the
hours
which
he
spent
out
of
his
study
and
especially
that
he
might
make
these
hours
more
frequent
his
daughter
had
invited
his
friend
the
authoress
of
to
come
out
to
abbotsford
and
her
coming
was
serviceable
for
she
knew
and
loved
him
well
and
she
had
seen
enough
of
affliction
akin
to
his
to
be
well
skilled
in
dealing
with
it
she
could
not
be
an
hour
in
his
company
without
observing
what
filled
his
children
with
more
sorrow
than
all
the
rest
of
the
case
he
would
begin
a
story
as
gaily
as
ever
and
go
on
in
spite
of
the
hesitation
in
his
speech
to
tell
it
with
highly
picturesque
effect
but
before
he
reached
the
point
it
would
seem
as
if
some
internal
spring
had
given
way
he
paused
and
gazed
round
him
with
the
blank
anxiety
of
look
that
a
blind
man
has
when
he
has
dropped
his
staff
unthinking
friends
sometimes
gave
him
the
abruptly
i
noticed
the
delicacy
of
miss
ferrier
on
such
occasions
her
sight
was
bad
and
she
took
care
not
to
use
her
glasses
when
he
was
speaking
and
she
affected
also
to
be
troubled
with
deafness
and
would
say
i
am
getting
as
dull
as
a
post
i
have
not
heard
a
word
since
you
said
so
and
so
being
sure
to
mention
a
circumstance
behind
that
at
which
he
had
really
halted
he
then
took
up
the
thread
with
his
habitual
smile
of
courtesy
as
if
forgetting
his
case
entirely
in
the
consideration
of
the
lady
infirmity
a
very
interesting
account
of
her
recollections
of
visits
to
ashestiel
and
abbotsford
appeared
in
the
february
number
of
this
magazine
it
is
short
but
gives
a
sad
and
pathetic
picture
of
the
great
man
and
his
little
grandson
as
they
sat
side
by
side
at
table
the
following
letter
on
is
from
fletcher
a
distinguished
citizen
of
edinburgh
at
the
commencement
of
this
century
and
a
leader
of
the
whig
society
there
for
that
reason
it
is
worthy
of
insertion
here
her
son
married
miss
clavering
as
before
mentioned
her
by
her
daughter
lady
richardson
was
published
not
long
since
fletcher
to
miss
tadcaster
my
dear
miss
ferrier
i
should
not
have
been
so
long
in
thanking
you
for
your
kind
present
had
i
not
wished
to
subject
to
a
severer
test
than
that
chosen
by
the
french
dramatist
old
woman
probably
partook
of
the
vivacity
of
her
nation
but
my
old
aunt
as
mary
will
tell
you
is
sick
and
often
very
sorrowful
and
yet
has
made
her
laugh
heartily
and
cheated
her
of
many
wearisome
hours
of
lamentation
my
grandson
archibald
taylor
too
forsook
football
and
cricket
for
your
fascinating
book
and
told
me
could
sit
up
all
night
to
see
what
had
become
of
ronald
ribley
and
my
dear
hit
his
comic
fancy
particularly
my
two
most
bookish
neighbours
one
an
oxford
divine
and
the
other
a
cambridge
student
declare
that
glenroy
and
are
exquisite
originals
my
own
favourite
macaulay
preserves
her
to
the
last
though
i
thought
you
rather
unmerciful
in
shutting
her
up
so
long
in
johnnie
nursery
the
fashionable
heartlessness
of
lady
elizabeth
and
her
daughter
is
coloured
to
the
life
and
the
refreshment
of
returning
to
nature
truth
affection
and
happiness
at
inch
orran
is
admirably
managed
mary
tells
me
you
have
returned
from
fife
with
fresh
materials
for
future
volumes
go
on
dear
miss
ferrier
you
are
accountable
for
the
talents
entrusted
to
you
go
on
to
detect
selfishness
in
all
its
various
forms
and
foldings
to
put
pride
and
vanity
to
shame
to
prove
that
vulgarity
belongs
more
to
character
than
condition
and
that
all
who
make
the
world
their
standard
are
essentially
vulgar
and
however
noble
their
exterior
or
refined
their
manners
may
be
and
that
true
dignity
and
elevation
belong
only
to
those
to
whom
milton
lines
may
be
applied
care
is
fixed
and
zealously
attends
to
fill
thy
odorous
lamp
with
deeds
of
light
and
hope
that
reaps
not
shame
the
following
letter
from
joanna
baillie
gives
a
very
just
and
truthful
criticism
on
joanna
baillie
to
miss
hampstead
my
dear
madam
i
received
your
very
kind
present
of
your
last
work
about
three
weeks
ago
and
am
very
grateful
for
the
pleasure
i
have
had
in
reading
it
and
for
being
thus
remembered
by
you
i
thank
you
also
for
the
pleasure
and
amusement
which
my
sisters
and
some
other
friends
have
drawn
from
it
the
first
volume
struck
me
as
extremely
clever
the
description
of
the
different
characters
their
dialogues
and
the
writer
own
remarks
excellent
there
is
a
spur
both
with
the
writer
and
the
reader
on
the
opening
of
a
work
which
naturally
gives
the
beginning
of
a
story
many
advantages
but
i
must
confess
that
your
characters
never
forget
their
outset
but
are
well
supported
to
the
very
end
your
molly
macaulay
is
a
delightful
creature
and
the
footing
she
is
on
with
glenroy
very
naturally
represented
to
say
nothing
of
the
rising
of
her
character
at
the
end
when
the
weight
of
contempt
is
removed
from
her
which
is
very
good
and
true
to
nature
your
minister
hateful
as
he
is
is
very
amusing
and
a
true
representative
of
a
few
of
the
scotch
clergy
and
with
different
language
and
manners
of
a
great
many
of
the
english
clergy
worldly
mean
men
who
boldly
make
their
way
into
every
great
and
wealthy
family
for
the
sake
of
preferment
and
good
cheer
your
lady
elizabeth
too
with
all
her
selfishness
and
excess
of
absurdity
is
true
to
herself
throughout
and
makes
a
very
characteristic
ending
of
it
in
her
third
marriage
but
why
should
i
tease
you
by
going
through
the
different
characters
suffice
it
to
say
that
i
thank
you
very
heartily
and
congratulate
you
on
again
having
added
a
work
of
so
much
merit
to
our
stock
of
national
novels
perhaps
before
this
you
have
received
a
very
short
publication
of
mine
on
a
very
serious
subject
i
desired
my
bookseller
to
send
a
copy
to
you
enclosed
along
with
one
to
your
friend
miss
mackenzie
how
far
you
will
agree
with
my
opinions
regarding
it
i
can
not
say
but
of
one
thing
i
am
sure
that
you
will
judge
with
candour
and
charity
i
should
have
sent
one
to
alison
had
i
not
thought
it
presumptuous
in
me
to
send
such
a
work
to
any
clergyman
and
with
only
one
exception
a
presbyterian
clergyman
i
have
abstained
from
doing
so
i
was
very
much
obliged
to
mackenzie
lord
lady
for
the
letter
she
was
so
good
as
to
write
me
in
her
stead
if
you
should
meet
her
soon
may
i
beg
that
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
thank
her
in
my
name
i
was
very
sorry
indeed
to
learn
from
her
that
miss
mackenzie
had
been
so
ill
and
was
then
so
weak
and
that
the
favourable
account
i
had
received
of
your
eyes
had
been
too
favourable
with
all
good
wishes
to
you
in
which
my
sister
begs
to
join
me
i
remain
my
dear
madam
gratefully
and
sincerely
yours

molly

charming
her
niece
miss
cumming
is
an
old
acquaintance
of

told
me
the
character
was
drawn
to
the
life
the
old
lady
is
still
alive
in
her
year
at
inveraray
and
miss
who
is
a
very
clever
pleasing
person
seems
delighted
with
the
truth
and
spirit
of
the
whole

entire
and
perfect

as

my
dear
madam
i
return
your
book
but
i
an
unable
to
return
you
adequate
thanks
for
being
the
cause
of
my
reading
it
i
have
done
this
and
all
with
me
with
delight
from
the
interest
and
admiration
at
the
whole
composition
the
novelty
and
excitement
of
its
plan
the
exquisite
and
thrilling
manner
of
its
disclosure
the
absence
of
all
flat
and
heavy
intervals
the
conception
and
support
of
the
characters
the
sound
and
salutary
moral
that
pervades
it
all
these
make
me
love
and
honour
its
valuable
authoress
and
lament
that
i
am
not
in
the
number
of
her
acquaintance
we
all
upon
miss
macaulay
and
grieve
that
she
is
not
living
at
richmond
or
petersham
and
has
supplied
me
with
a
new
name
for
our
little
young
dog
whom
i
have
called
in
memorial
of
his
little
nephew
or
niece
little
with
all
the
thanks
however
that
i
can
offer
etc

the
next
tribute
of
admiration
bestowed
on
was
from
sir
james
mackintosh
james
mackintosh
to
miss
london
dear
miss
ferrier
let
me
tell
you
a
fact
which
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
from
mentioning
as
some
subsidiary
proof
of
your
power
on
the
day
of
the
dissolution
of
parliament
and
in
the
critical
hours
between
twelve
and
three
i
was
employed
in
reading
part
of
the
second
volume
of
my
mind
was
so
completely
occupied
on
your
colony
in
argyleshire
that
i
did
not
throw
away
a
thought
on
kings
or
parliaments
and
was
not
moved
by
the
general
curiosity
to
stir
abroad
till
i
had
finished
your
volume
it
would
have
been
nothing
if
you
had
so
agitated
a
youth
of
genius
and
susceptibility
prone
to
literary
enthusiasm
but
such
a
victory
over
an
old
hack
is
perhaps
worthy
of
your
i
am
my
dear
miss
ferrier
your
friend
and
admirer
j
mackintosh
professor
wilson
christopher
north
and
his
uncle
robert
sym
timothy
tickler
discuss
the
merits
of
in
the
would
also
except
miss
susan
ferrier
her
novels
no
doubt
have
many
defects
their
plots
are
poor
their
episodes
disproportionate
and
the
characters
too
often
caricatures
but
they
are
all
with
such
specimens
of
sagacity
such
happy
traits
of
nature
such
flashes
of
genuine
satire
such
easy
humour
sterling
good
sense
and
above
all
god
only
knows
where
she
picked
it
up
mature
and
perfect
knowledge
of
the
world
that
i
think
we
may
safely
anticipate
for
them
a
different
fate
from
what
awaits
even
the
cleverest
of
juvenile
novels
are
the
works
of
a
very
clever
woman
sir
and
they
have
one
feature
of
true
and
melancholy
interest
quite
peculiar
to
themselves
it
is
in
them
alone
that
the
ultimate
and
debasement
of
the
highland
character
has
been
depicted
sir
walter
scott
had
fixed
the
enamel
of
genius
over
the
last
fitful
gleams
of
their
chivalry
but
a
humbler
and
sadder
scene
the
age
of
clans
of
chieftains
dwindled
into
imitation
squires
and
of
chiefs
content
to
barter
the
recollections
of
a
thousand
years
for
a
few
gaudy
seasons
of
almacks
and
crockfords
the
euthanasia
of
kilted
aldermen
and
steamboat
pibrochs
was
reserved
for
miss
ferrier
she
in
general
fails
almost
as
egregiously
as
hook
does
in
the
pathetic
but
in
her
last
piece
there
is
one
scene
of
this
description
worthy
of
either
sterne
or
goldsmith
i
mean
where
the
young
man
supposed
to
have
been
lost
at
sea
revisits
after
a
lapse
of
time
the
precincts
of
his
own
home
watching
unseen
in
the
twilight
the
occupations
and
bearings
of
the
different
members
of
the
family
and
resolving
under
the
influence
of
a
most
generous
feeling
to
keep
the
secret
of
his
preservation
this
is
not
true
as
there
are
many
pathetic
passages
in
particularly
between
edith
the
heroine
and
her
faithless
lover
sir
reginald
ronald
malcolm
remember
it
well
and
you
might
bestow
the
same
kind
of
praise
on
the
whole
character
of
molly
macaulay
it
is
a
picture
of
humble
devotion
and
indefatigable
gentleness
of
which
perhaps
no
sinner
of
our
gender
could
have
adequately
filled
up
the
outline
miss
ferrier
appears
habitually
in
the
light
of
a
hard
satirist
but
there
is
always
a
fund
of
romance
at
the
bottom
of
every
true
woman
heart
who
has
tried
to
stifle
and
suppress
that
element
more
carefully
and
pertinaciously
and
yet
who
has
drawn
in
spite
of
herself
more
genuine
tears
than
the
authoress
of
susan
the
story
of
like
its
predecessors
is
laid
in
miss
favourite
highlands
and
it
contains
several
picturesque
and
vivid
descriptions
of
scenery
there
inveraray
and
its
surroundings
generally
forming
the
model
for
her
graphic
pen
much
of
this
novel
was
written
at
stirling
castle
when
she
was
there
on
a
visit
to
her
sister
graham
whose
husband
general
graham
was
governor
of
that
garrison
after
the
publication
of
this
last
work
and
the
offer
of
a
thousand
pounds
from
a
london
publisher
for
anything
from
her
pen
she
entirely
ceased
from
her
literary
labours
being
content
to
rest
upon
the
solid
and
enduring
reputation
her
three
bantlings
as
she
called
her
novels
had
won
for
her
the
following
fragment
however
was
found
among
her
papers
and
is
the
portrait
of
another
old
maid
and
might
serve
as
a
companion
to
miss
pratt
as
it
is
amusing
and
in
the
writer
satirical
style
i
lay
it
before
my
readers
celebrated
by
burns
the
poet
for
her
beauty
she
inspired
his
muse
when
turning
the
corner
of
george
street
edinburgh
the
lines
addressed
to
her
are
to
be
found
in
his
she
was
also
a
artist
the
illustrations
in
the
work
called
the
are
from
her
pencil
it
was
published
by
blackwood
she
says
i
made
two
attempts
to
write
but
could
not
please
myself
and
would
not
publish
miss
betty
landon
was
a
single
lady
of
small
fortune
few
personal
charms
and
a
most
jaundiced
imagination
there
was
no
event
not
even
the
most
fortunate
from
which
miss
betty
could
not
extract
evil
everything
even
the
milk
of
human
kindness
with
her
turned
to
gall
and
vinegar
thus
if
any
of
her
friends
were
married
she
sighed
over
the
miseries
of
the
wedded
state
if
they
were
single
she
bewailed
their
solitary
useless
condition
if
they
were
parents
she
pitied
them
for
having
children
if
they
had
no
children
she
pitied
them
for
being
childless
but
one
of
her
own
letters
will
do
greater
justice
to
the
turn
of
her
mind
than
the
most
elaborate
description
dear
miss
i
ought
to
have
written
to
you
long
before
now
but
i
have
suffered
so
much
from
the
constant
changes
of
the
weather
that
the
wonder
is
i
am
able
to
hold
a
pen
during
the
whole
summer
the
heat
was
really
quite
intolerable
not
a
drop
of
rain
or
a
breath
of
wind
the
cattle
dying
for
absolute
want
the
vegetables
dear
and
scarce
and
as
for
fruit
that
you
know
in
this
town
is
at
all
times
scarce
and
bad
and
particularly
when
there
is
the
greatest
occasion
for
it
in
the
autumn
we
never
had
two
days
alike
either
wind
or
rain
or
frost
or
something
or
another
and
as
for
our
winter
you
know
what
that
is
either
a
constant
splash
of
rain
or
a
frost
like
to
take
the
skin
off
you
for
these
six
weeks
i
may
say
i
have
had
a
constant
running
at
my
head
with
a
return
of
my
old
complaint
but
as
for
doctors
i
see
no
good
they
do
except
to
load
people
stomachs
and
pick
their
pockets
everything
now
is
imposition
i
really
think
the
very
pills
are
not
what
they
were
thirty
years
ago
how
people
with
families
continue
to
live
is
a
mystery
to
me
and
people
still
going
on
marrying
in
the
face
of
national
debt
taxes
a
new
war
a
starving
population
ruined
commerce
and
no
outlet
for
young
men
in
any
quarter
god
only
knows
what
is
to
be
the
end
of
all
this
in
spite
of
all
this
these
thoughtless
young
creatures
the
truemans
have
thought
proper
to
make
out
their
marriage
he
is
just
and
she
is
not
yet
nineteen
so
you
may
judge
what
a
prudent
establishment
it
will
be
he
is
in
a
good
enough
business
at
present
but
in
these
times
who
can
tell
to
happen
he
may
be
wallowing
in
wealth
and
bankrupt
his
sister
marriage
with
fairplay
is
now
quite
off
and
her
prospects
for
life
poor
thing
completely
wrecked
her
looks
are
entirely
gone
and
her
spirits
quite
broken
she
is
not
like
the
same
creature
and
to
be
sure
to
a
girl
who
had
set
her
heart
upon
being
married
it
must
be
a
great
and
severe
disappointment
for
this
was
her
only
chance
unless
she
tries
india
and
the
expense
of
the
outfit
must
be
a
complete
bar
to
that
you
would
hear
that
poor
lady
oldhouse
has
had
a
son
it
seemed
a
desirable
thing
situated
as
they
are
with
an
entailed
property
and
yet
when
i
look
around
me
and
see
the
way
that
sons
go
on
the
dissipation
and
extravagance
and
the
heartbreak
they
are
to
their
parents
i
think
a
son
anything
but
a
blessing
no
word
of
anything
of
that
kind
to
the
poor
richardsons
with
all
their
riches
they
are
without
anyone
to
come
after
them
the
prowleys
are
up
in
the
air
at
having
got
what
they
call
a
fine
appointment
for
their
fourth
son
but
for
my
part
i
really
sick
of
hearing
of
boys
going
to
india
for
after
all
what
do
they
do
there
i
never
hear
of
their
sending
home
anything
but
black
children
and
when
they
come
home
themselves
what
do
they
bring
but
yellow
faces
constitutions
and
livers
like
crawling
about
from
one
to
another
till
they
are
picked
up
by
some
miss
who
does
not
care
twopence
for
them
a
beautiful
and
strong
feature
in
miss
ferrier
character
was
her
intense
devotion
to
her
father
and
when
he
died
the
loss
to
her
was
irreparable
she
also
was
much
attached
to
a
very
handsome
brother
james
he
was
colonel
of
the
regiment
or
scots
brigade
and
died
in
india
in
at
the
early
age
of
he
had
been
at
the
siege
of
seringapatam
in
and
was
much
distinguished
by
the
notice
of
napoleon
at
paris
in
february
whence
he
writes
to
his
sister
susan
i
think
i
wrote
you
i
had
been
introduced
to
the
chief
consul
i
was
on
sunday
last
presented
to
his
lady
whom
i
do
not
at
all
admire
the
great
man
spoke
to
me
then
again
which
is
a
very
unusual
thing
and
i
am
told
by
the
french
i
must
be
in
his
good
graces
however
i
myself
rather
think
it
was
my
good
fortune
only
at
all
events
it
has
given
me
much
pleasure
for
it
would
have
only
been
doing
the
thing
half
if
he
had
not
spoken
to
me
i
do
not
think
any
of
the
pictures
like
him
much
although
most
of
them
have
some
resemblance
they
give
him
a
frown
in
general
which
he
certainly
has
not
so
far
from
it
that
when
he
speaks
he
has
one
of
the
finest
expressions
possible
here
unfortunately
this
interesting
description
comes
abruptly
to
an
end
the
rest
of
the
letter
being
lost
on
account
of
failing
health
and
increased
bodily
languor
miss
ferrier
latterly
lived
a
very
retired
life
seeing
few
but
very
intimate
friends
and
as
she
said
we
are
more
recluse
than
ever
as
our
little
circle
is
yearly
contracting
and
my
eyes
are
more
and
more
averse
to
light
than
ever
again
she
writes
i
can
say
nothing
good
of
myself
my
cough
is
very
severe
and
will
probably
continue
so
at
least
as
long
as
this
weather
lasts
but
i
have
many
comforts
for
which
i
am
thankful
amongst
those
i
must
reckon
silence
and
darkness
which
are
my
best
companions
at
present
for
years
she
had
suffered
from
her
eyes
being
nearly
quite
blind
of
one
in
she
went
to
london
to
consult
an
oculist
but
unfortunately
derived
little
benefit
while
there
she
visited
isleworth
in
order
to
see
a
villa
belonging
to
lord
cassillis
and
which
subsequently
figured
in
as
woodlands
lady
waldegrave
rural
retreat
near
london
a
valued
friend
who
saw
much
of
her
remarked
lady
morgan
a
from
her
eyes
was
most
anxious
she
should
consult
alexander
the
eminent
oculist
as
he
entirely
cured
her
after
four
years
expectation
of
total
blindness
lady
richardson
the
wonderful
vivacity
she
maintained
in
the
midst
of
darkness
and
pain
for
so
many
years
the
humour
wit
and
honesty
of
her
character
as
well
as
the
christian
submission
with
which
she
bore
her
great
privation
and
general
discomfort
when
not
suffering
acute
pain
made
everyone
who
knew
her
desirous
to
alleviate
the
tediousness
of
her
days
and
i
used
to
read
a
great
deal
to
her
at
one
time
and
i
never
left
her
darkened
chamber
without
feeling
that
i
had
gained
something
better
than
the
book
we
might
be
reading
from
her
quick
perception
of
its
faults
and
its
beauties
and
her
unmerciful
remarks
on
all
that
was
mean
or
unworthy
in
conduct
or
expression
but
perhaps
the
most
faithful
picture
of
her
is
conveyed
in
this
brief
sentence
from
scott
diary
who
describes
her
as
a
gifted
personage
having
besides
her
great
talents
conversation
the
least
of
any
at
least
whom
i
have
ever
seen
among
the
long
list
i
have
encountered
simple
full
of
humour
and
exceedingly
ready
at
repartee
and
all
this
without
the
least
affectation
of
the
from
the
natural
modesty
of
her
character
she
had
a
great
dislike
to
her
biography
or
memorial
of
her
in
any
shape
being
written
for
she
destroyed
all
letters
that
might
have
been
used
for
such
a
purpose
publicity
of
any
kind
being
most
distasteful
to
her
evidence
of
which
is
very
clearly
shown
in
the
first
part
of
this
narrative
the
chief
secret
of
her
success
as
a
novelist
setting
aside
her
great
genius
was
the
great
care
and
time
she
bestowed
on
the
formation
of
each
novel
an
interval
of
six
years
occurring
between
each
the
result
being
delineations
of
character
that
are
unique
unfortunately
there
is
little
to
relate
regarding
her
childhood
that
most
interesting
period
of
human
existence
in
the
lives
of
and
which
is
generally
distinguished
by
some
uncommon
traits
of
character
people
of
genius
save
that
she
had
for
a
school
companion
and
playfellow
the
late
lord
brougham
the
distinguished
statesman
she
was
remarkable
also
for
her
power
of
mimicry
an
amusing
anecdote
of
this
rather
dangerous
gift
is
the
following
her
brothers
and
sisters
returned
home
from
a
ball
very
hungry
and
entered
her
room
where
they
supposed
she
lay
asleep
and
while
discussing
the
events
of
the
evening
and
the
repast
they
had
procured
by
stealth
unknown
to
their
father
they
were
suddenly
put
to
flight
by
the
sounds
and
voice
as
they
thought
of
their
dreaded
parent
ascending
the
stairs
and
in
their
confusion
and
exit
from
the
room
overturned
chairs
and
tables
much
to
the
amusement
of
little
susan
who
no
doubt
enjoyed
the
fright
and
commotion
she
had
caused
and
who
mimicked
under
the
cover
of
the
bedclothes
the
accents
of
her
redoubtable
parent
a
fit
punishment
as
she
thought
for
their
ruthless
invasion
of
her
chamber
and
their
not
offering
her
a
share
of
their
supper
an
old
miss
peggy
campbell
sister
to
sir
islay
campbell
president
of
the
court
of
session
was
also
taken
off
by
her
and
so
like
that
her
father
actually
came
into
the
room
where
she
was
amusing
her
hearers
thinking
that
miss
campbell
was
really
present
when
she
died
a
blank
was
left
in
her
native
city
that
has
not
been
since
filled
the
modern
athens
having
somewhat
deteriorated
in
the
wit
learning
and
refinement
that
so
distinguished
her
in
the
days
that
are
gone
recollections
of
visits
to
ashestiel
and
abbotsford
reprinted
from
the
magazine
for
february
by
susan
edmonstone
ferrier
of
and
i
have
never
kept
either
or
journal
and
as
my
memory
is
not
a
retentive
one
i
have
allowed
much
to
escape
which
i
should
now
vainly
attempt
to
recall
some
things
must
however
have
made
a
vivid
and
durable
impression
on
my
mind
as
fragments
remain
after
the
lapse
of
years
far
more
distinct
than
occurrences
of
much
more
recent
date
such
amongst
others
are
my
recollections
of
my
visits
to
ashestiel
and
abbotsford
the
first
took
place
in
the
autumn
of
in
consequence
of
repeated
and
pressing
invitations
from
scott
to
my
father
in
which
i
was
included
nothing
could
be
kinder
than
our
welcome
or
more
gratifying
than
the
attentions
we
received
during
our
stay
but
the
weather
was
too
broken
and
stormy
to
admit
of
our
enjoying
any
of
the
pleasant
excursions
our
more
host
had
intended
for
us
my
father
and
i
could
therefore
only
take
short
drives
with
scott
while
the
bard
about
one
mounted
his
pony
and
accompanied
by
terry
the
comedian
his
own
son
walter
and
our
young
relative
george
kinloch
sallied
forth
for
a
long
morning
ride
in
spite
of
wind
and
rain
in
the
evening
terry
commonly
read
some
scenes
from
a
play
to
which
scott
listened
with
delight
though
every
word
must
have
been
quite
familiar
to
him
as
he
occasionally
took
a
part
in
the
dialogue
impromptu
at
other
times
he
recited
old
and
awesome
ballads
from
memory
the
very
names
of
which
i
have
forgot
the
night
preceding
our
departure
had
blown
a
perfect
hurricane
we
were
to
leave
immediately
after
breakfast
and
while
the
carriage
was
preparing
scott
stepped
to
a
and
wrote
a
few
hurried
lines
in
the
course
of
a
very
few
minutes
these
he
put
into
my
hand
as
he
led
me
to
the
carriage
they
were
in
allusion
to
the
storm
coupled
with
a
friendly
adieu
and
are
to
be
found
in
my
autograph
album
the
mountain
winds
are
up
and
proud
heath
and
hill
careering
loud
the
groaning
forest
to
its
power
yields
all
that
formed
our
summer
bower
the
summons
wakes
the
anxious
swain
whose
tardy
shocks
still
load
the
plain
and
bids
the
sleepless
merchant
weep
whose
richer
hazard
loads
the
deep
for
me
the
blast
or
low
or
high
blows
nought
of
wealth
or
poverty
it
can
but
whirl
in
whimsies
vain
the
windmill
of
a
restless
brain
and
bid
me
tell
in
slipshod
verse
what
honest
prose
might
best
rehearse
how
much
we
grieve
our
valued
friends
our
cot
should
leave
unseen
each
beauty
that
we
boast
the
little
wonders
of
our
coast
that
still
the
pile
of
melrose
gray
for
you
must
rise
in
minstrel
lay
and
yarrow
birk
immortal
long
for
yon
but
bloom
in
rural
song
yet
hope
who
still
in
present
sorrow
whispers
the
promise
of
tells
us
of
future
days
to
come
when
you
shall
glad
our
rustic
home
when
this
wild
whirlwind
shall
be
still
and
summer
sleep
on
glen
and
hill
and
tweed
unvexed
by
storm
shall
guide
in
silvery
maze
his
stately
tide
doubling
in
mirror
every
rank
of
oak
and
alder
on
his
bank
and
our
kind
guests
such
welcome
prove
as
most
we
wish
to
those
we
love
lines
written
by
walter
scott
while
the
carriage
was
waiting
to
convey
my
father
and
me
from
s
the
invitation
had
been
often
repeated
but
my
dear
father
increasing
infirmities
made
him
averse
to
leave
home
and
when
in
compliance
with
sir
walter
urgent
request
i
visited
abbotsford
in
the
autumn
of
i
went
alone
i
was
met
at
the
outer
gate
by
sir
walter
who
welcomed
me
in
the
kindest
manner
and
most
flattering
terms
indeed
nothing
could
surpass
the
courtesy
of
his
address
on
such
occasions
on
our
way
to
the
house
he
stopped
and
called
his
two
little
grandchildren
walter
and
charlotte
lockhart
who
were
chasing
each
other
like
butterflies
among
the
flowers
the
boy
was
quite
a
cupid
though
not
an
one
for
he
wore
a
tartan
cloak
whose
sundry
extras
fluttered
in
the
breeze
as
he
ran
to
obey
the
summons
and
gave
occasion
to
his
grandfather
to
present
him
to
me
as
major
waddell
the
pretty
little
girl
he
next
introduced
as
whipperstowrie
and
then
aware
of
my
love
for
fairy
lore
he
related
the
tale
in
his
own
inimitable
manner
as
he
walked
slowly
and
stopped
frequently
in
our
approach
to
the
house
as
soon
as
i
could
look
round
i
was
struck
with
the
singular
and
picturesque
appearance
of
the
mansion
and
its
yet
i
must
own
there
was
more
of
than
of
admiration
in
my
feelings
too
many
objects
seemed
crowded
together
in
a
small
space
and
there
was
a
felt
want
of
breadth
and
repose
for
the
eye
on
entering
the
house
i
was
however
charmed
with
the
rich
imposing
beauty
of
the
hall
and
admired
the
handsome
antique
appearance
of
the
with
its
interesting
pictures
after
luncheon
sir
walter
was
at
pains
to
point
them
out
to
my
notice
and
related
the
histories
of
each
and
all
he
then
conducted
me
through
the
apartments
and
showed
me
so
much
and
told
me
so
many
anecdotes
illustrative
of
the
various
objects
of
interest
and
curiosity
they
contained
that
i
retain
a
very
confused
and
imperfect
recollection
of
what
i
saw
and
heard
it
was
a
strong
proof
of
his
that
in
showing
the
many
works
of
art
and
relics
of
antiquity
he
had
continued
to
accumulate
and
arrange
with
so
much
taste
and
skill
he
should
have
been
at
such
pains
to
point
out
the
merits
and
relate
the
history
of
most
of
them
to
one
so
incapable
of
appreciating
their
value
but
he
never
allowed
one
to
feel
their
own
deficiencies
for
he
never
appeared
to
be
aware
of
them
himself
one
of
miss
ferrier
characters
in
her
novel
of
it
was
in
the
quiet
of
a
small
domestic
circle
i
had
again
an
opportunity
of
enjoying
the
society
of
sir
walter
scott
and
of
witnessing
during
the
ten
days
i
remained
the
unbroken
serenity
of
his
temper
the
unflagging
cheerfulness
of
his
spirits
and
the
unceasing
courtesy
of
his
manners
i
had
been
promised
a
quiet
time
else
i
should
not
have
gone
and
indeed
the
state
of
the
family
was
a
sufficient
guarantee
against
all
festivities
lockhart
was
confined
to
bed
by
severe
indisposition
while
lockhart
was
detained
in
london
by
the
alarming
illness
of
their
eldest
boy
and
both
captain
scott
and
his
brother
were
absent
the
party
therefore
consisted
only
of
sir
walter
and
miss
scott
miss
macdonald
buchanan
who
was
almost
one
of
the
family
and
myself
being
the
only
stranger
i
consequently
came
in
for
a
larger
share
of
my
amiable
host
time
and
attention
than
i
should
otherwise
have
been
entitled
to
expect
many
a
pleasant
tale
and
amusing
anecdote
i
might
have
had
to
relate
had
i
written
down
half
of
what
i
daily
heard
but
i
had
always
an
invincible
repugnance
to
playing
the
and
taking
down
people
words
under
their
own
roof
every
day
sir
walter
was
ready
by
one
to
accompany
us
either
in
driving
or
walking
often
in
both
and
in
either
there
was
the
same
inexhaustible
flow
of
legendary
lore
romantic
incident
apt
quotation
curious
or
diverting
story
and
sometimes
old
ballads
were
recited
commemorative
of
some
of
the
localities
through
which
he
passed
those
who
had
seen
him
only
amidst
the
ordinary
avocations
of
life
or
even
doing
the
honours
of
his
own
table
could
scarcely
have
conceived
the
fire
and
animation
of
his
countenance
at
such
times
when
his
eyes
seemed
literally
to
kindle
and
even
as
some
one
has
remarked
to
change
their
colour
and
become
a
sort
of
deep
sapphire
blue
but
perhaps
from
being
close
to
him
and
in
the
open
air
i
was
more
struck
with
this
peculiarity
than
those
whose
better
sight
enabled
them
to
mark
his
varying
expression
at
other
times
yet
i
must
confess
this
was
an
enthusiasm
i
found
as
little
infectious
as
that
of
his
antiquarianism
on
the
contrary
i
often
wished
his
noble
faculties
had
been
exercised
on
loftier
themes
than
those
which
seemed
to
stir
his
very
soul
the
evenings
were
passed
either
in
lockhart
bedroom
or
in
chatting
quietly
by
the
fireside
below
but
wherever
we
were
he
was
always
the
same
kind
unostentatious
amusing
and
companion
the
day
before
i
was
to
depart
sir
david
wilkie
and
his
sister
arrived
and
the
fergussons
and
one
or
two
friends
were
invited
to
meet
him
lockhart
was
so
desirous
of
meeting
this
old
friend
and
distinguished
person
that
though
unable
to
put
her
foot
to
the
ground
she
caused
herself
to
be
dressed
and
carried
down
to
the
while
the
company
were
at
dinner
great
was
her
father
surprise
and
delight
on
his
entrance
to
find
her
seated
looking
well
and
in
high
spirits
with
her
harp
before
her
ready
to
sing
his
favourite
ballads
this
raised
his
spirits
above
their
usual
quiet
pitch
and
towards
the
end
of
the
evening
he
proposed
to
wind
up
the
whole
by
all
present
standing
in
a
circle
with
hands
joined
singing
weel
may
we
a
be
ill
may
we
never
see
lockhart
was
of
course
unable
to
join
the
festive
band
sir
david
wilkie
was
languid
and
dispirited
from
bad
health
and
my
feelings
were
not
such
as
to
enable
me
to
join
in
what
seemed
to
me
little
else
than
a
mockery
of
human
life
but
rather
than
displace
the
mirth
i
but
could
not
long
remain
a
passive
spectator
the
glee
seemed
forced
and
unnatural
it
touched
no
sympathetic
chord
it
only
jarred
the
feelings
it
was
the
last
attempt
at
gaiety
i
witnessed
within
the
walls
of
abbotsford
although
i
had
intended
to
confine
my
slight
reminiscence
of
sir
walter
scott
to
the
time
i
had
passed
with
him
under
his
own
roof
in
the
country
yet
i
can
not
refrain
from
noticing
the
great
kindness
i
received
from
him
during
the
following
winter
in
town
i
had
when
at
abbotsford
in
the
autumn
spoken
to
him
for
the
time
of
my
authorship
and
of
the
work
on
which
i
was
then
engaged
he
entered
into
the
subject
with
much
warmth
and
earnestness
shook
his
head
at
hearing
how
matters
had
hitherto
been
transacted
and
said
unless
i
could
make
a
better
bargain
in
this
instance
i
must
leave
to
him
the
disposal
of
i
did
so
and
from
the
much
more
liberal
terms
he
made
with
cadell
i
felt
when
too
late
i
had
acted
unwisely
in
not
having
sooner
consulted
him
or
some
one
versant
in
these
matters
but
at
that
time
was
all
i
was
anxious
about
and
so
i
paid
the
penalty
of
trusting
entirely
to
the
good
faith
of
the
publishers
i
saw
sir
walter
frequently
during
the
winter
and
occasionally
dined
with
miss
scott
and
him
or
with
one
or
two
friends
as
i
did
not
go
into
parties
neither
indeed
did
he
give
any
but
on
account
of
the
state
of
his
affairs
lived
as
retiredly
as
he
possibly
could
in
the
month
of
february
he
sustained
a
paralytic
shock
as
soon
as
i
heard
of
this
i
went
to
miss
scott
from
whom
i
learned
the
particulars
she
had
seen
her
father
in
his
study
a
short
time
before
apparently
in
his
usual
health
she
had
returned
to
the
drawing
room
when
sir
walter
opened
the
door
came
in
but
stood
looking
at
her
with
a
most
peculiar
and
expression
of
countenance
it
immediately
struck
her
he
had
come
to
communicate
some
very
distressing
intelligence
and
she
exclaimed
oh
papa
is
johnnie
gone
he
made
no
reply
but
still
continued
standing
still
and
regarding
her
with
the
same
fearful
expression
she
then
cried
oh
papa
speak
tell
me
is
it
sophia
herself
still
he
remained
immovable
almost
frantic
she
then
screamed
it
is
walter
it
is
walter
i
know
it
is
upon
which
sir
walter
fell
senseless
on
the
floor
medical
assistance
was
speedily
procured
after
being
bled
he
recovered
his
speech
and
his
first
words
were
it
was
very
strange
very
horrible
he
afterwards
told
her
he
had
all
at
once
felt
very
queer
and
as
if
unable
to
articulate
he
then
went
upstairs
in
hopes
of
getting
rid
of
the
sensation
by
movement
but
it
would
not
do
he
felt
perfectly
or
rather
till
overcome
by
witnessing
her
distress
this
took
place
i
think
on
the
and
on
the
i
was
invited
to
dine
with
him
and
found
him
without
any
trace
of
illness
but
as
cheerful
and
animated
as
usual
not
being
very
correct
as
to
dates
i
should
scarcely
have
ventured
to
name
the
day
had
not
a
trifling
circumstance
served
to
mark
it
after
dinner
he
proposed
that
instead
of
going
to
the
we
should
remain
with
him
and
have
tea
in
the
dining
room
in
the
interval
the
post
letters
were
brought
and
amongst
others
there
was
one
from
a
sister
of
sir
thomas
lawrence
bloxam
enclosing
a
letter
of
her
brother
having
heard
that
sir
walter
had
expressed
a
wish
to
have
some
memorial
of
him
rather
of
his
pencil
than
his
pen
said
he
as
he
handed
the
letter
to
me
who
as
a
collector
of
autographs
would
probably
value
them
more
than
he
did
and
on
referring
to
letter
i
find
the
edinburgh
february
the
i
received
repeated
invitations
to
abbotsford
and
had
fixed
to
go
on
the
of
april
when
the
day
before
skene
called
upon
me
with
the
sad
tidings
of
another
paralytic
stroke
which
not
only
put
a
stop
to
my
visit
for
the
present
but
rendered
it
very
doubtful
whether
i
should
ever
see
him
again
but
the
worst
fears
of
his
friends
were
not
yet
to
be
realised
early
in
may
the
invitation
was
renewed
in
a
note
from
himself
which
i
availed
myself
of
too
well
assured
it
was
a
privilege
i
should
enjoy
for
the
last
time
on
reaching
abbotsford
i
found
some
morning
visitors
and
james
etc
in
the
but
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
sir
walter
sent
for
me
to
his
study
i
found
him
seated
in
his
armchair
but
with
his
habitual
politeness
he
insisted
upon
rising
to
receive
me
though
he
did
so
with
such
extreme
difficulty
i
would
gladly
have
dispensed
with
this
mark
of
courtesy
his
welcome
was
not
less
cordial
than
usual
but
he
spoke
in
a
slow
and
somewhat
indistinct
manner
and
as
i
sat
close
by
him
i
could
perceive
but
too
plainly
the
change
which
had
taken
place
since
we
last
met
his
figure
was
unwieldy
not
so
much
from
increased
bulk
as
from
diminished
life
and
energy
his
face
was
swollen
and
puffy
his
complexion
mottled
and
discoloured
his
eyes
heavy
and
dim
his
head
had
been
shaved
and
he
wore
a
small
black
silk
cap
which
was
extremely
unbecoming
altogether
the
change
was
no
less
striking
than
painful
to
behold
the
impression
however
soon
wore
off
on
finding
as
i
believed
that
his
mind
was
unimpaired
and
his
warm
kindly
feelings
unchanged
there
was
no
company
and
the
dinner
party
consisted
of
and
lockhart
miss
scott
and
myself
sir
walter
did
not
join
us
till
the
dessert
when
he
entered
assisted
by
his
servant
and
took
his
place
at
the
foot
of
the
table
his
grandchildren
were
then
brought
in
and
his
favourite
johnnie
lockhart
was
seated
by
his
side
i
must
have
forgot
most
things
before
i
can
cease
to
recall
that
most
striking
and
impressive
spectacle
each
day
repeated
as
it
seemed
with
deepening
gloom
the
first
transient
glow
of
cheerfulness
which
had
welcomed
my
arrival
had
passed
away
and
been
succeeded
by
an
air
of
languor
and
dejection
which
sank
to
deepest
sadness
when
his
eye
rested
for
a
moment
on
his
once
darling
grandson
the
child
of
so
much
pride
and
promise
now
alas
how
changed
it
was
most
touching
to
look
upon
one
whose
morning
of
life
had
been
so
bright
and
beautiful
and
still
in
the
sunny
days
of
childhood
transformed
into
an
image
of
decrepitude
and
decay
the
fair
blooming
cheek
and
finely
chiselled
features
were
now
shrunk
and
stiffened
into
the
wan
and
rigid
inflexibility
of
old
age
while
the
black
bandages
which
swathed
the
little
pale
sad
countenance
gave
additional
gloom
and
harshness
to
the
profound
melancholy
which
clouded
its
most
intellectual
expression
disease
and
death
were
stamped
upon
the
grandsire
and
the
boy
as
they
sat
side
by
side
with
averted
eyes
each
as
if
in
the
bitterness
of
his
own
heart
refusing
to
comfort
or
be
comforted
the
two
who
had
been
wont
to
regard
each
other
so
fondly
and
so
proudly
now
seemed
averse
to
hold
communion
together
while
their
appearance
and
style
of
dress
the
black
cap
of
the
one
and
the
black
bandages
of
the
other
denoted
a
sympathy
in
suffering
if
in
nothing
else
the
picture
would
have
been
a
most
affecting
and
impressive
one
viewed
under
any
circumstances
but
was
rendered
doubly
so
by
the
contrast
which
everywhere
presented
itself
the
month
was
may
but
the
weather
had
all
the
warmth
of
summer
with
the
freshness
and
sweetness
of
spring
the
windows
of
the
were
open
to
admit
the
soft
balmy
air
which
came
and
went
like
the
warbling
of
music
but
whose
reviving
influence
seemed
unfelt
by
the
sufferers
the
trees
and
shrubs
and
flowers
were
putting
forth
their
tender
leaves
and
fragrant
blossoms
as
if
to
charm
senses
who
used
to
watch
their
progress
with
almost
paternal
interest
and
the
little
birds
were
singing
in
sweet
chorus
as
if
to
cheer
who
was
wont
to
listen
to
their
evening
song
with
such
placid
delight
all
around
were
the
dear
familiar
objects
which
had
hitherto
ministered
to
his
enjoyment
but
now
alas
miserable
comforters
were
they
all
it
was
impossible
to
look
upon
such
a
picture
without
beholding
in
it
the
realisation
of
those
solemn
and
affecting
passages
of
holy
writ
which
speak
to
us
of
the
ephemeral
nature
of
all
earthly
pleasures
and
of
the
mournful
insignificance
of
human
life
even
in
its
most
palmy
state
when
its
views
and
actions
its
hopes
and
desires
are
confined
to
this
sublunary
sphere
whence
then
cometh
any
wisdom
and
where
is
the
place
of
understanding
thus
saith
the
lord
let
not
the
wise
man
glory
in
his
wisdom
neither
let
the
mighty
man
glory
in
his
might
let
not
the
rich
man
glory
in
his
riches
but
let
him
that
glorieth
glory
in
this
that
he
understandeth
and
knoweth
me
that
i
am
the
lord
marriage
chapter
i
love
a
word
by
superstition
thought
a
god
by
use
turned
to
an
humour
by
made
a
flattering
madness
and
come
hither
child
said
the
old
earl
of
courtland
to
his
daughter
as
in
obedience
to
his
summons
she
entered
his
study
come
hither
i
say
i
wish
to
have
some
serious
conversation
with
you
so
dismiss
your
dogs
shut
the
door
and
sit
down
here
lady
juliana
rang
for
the
footman
to
take
venus
bade
pluto
be
quiet
like
a
darling
under
the
sofa
and
taking
cupid
in
her
arms
assured
his
lordship
he
need
fear
no
disturbance
from
the
sweet
creatures
and
that
she
would
be
all
attention
to
his
commands
kissing
her
cherished
pug
as
she
spoke
you
are
now
i
think
seventeen
juliana
said
his
lordship
in
a
solemn
important
tone
and
a
half
papa
it
is
therefore
time
you
should
be
thinking
of
establishing
yourself
in
the
world
have
you
ever
turned
your
thoughts
that
way
lady
juliana
cast
down
her
beautiful
eyes
and
was
silent
as
i
can
give
you
no
fortune
continued
the
earl
swelling
with
importance
as
he
proceeded
you
have
perhaps
no
great
pretensions
to
a
very
brilliant
establishment
oh
none
in
the
world
papa
eagerly
interrupted
lady
juliana
a
mere
competence
with
the
man
of
my
heart
the
man
of
a
fiddlestick
exclaimed
lord
courtland
in
a
fury
what
the
devil
have
you
to
do
with
a
heart
i
should
like
to
know
there
no
talking
to
a
young
woman
now
about
marriage
but
she
is
all
in
a
blaze
about
hearts
and
darts
and
and
but
hark
ye
child
i
suffer
no
daughter
of
mine
to
play
the
fool
with
her
heart
indeed
she
shall
marry
for
the
purpose
for
which
matrimony
was
ordained
amongst
people
of
birth
that
is
for
the
aggrandisement
of
her
family
the
extending
of
their
political
influence
for
becoming
in
short
the
depository
of
their
mutual
interest
these
are
the
only
purposes
for
which
persons
of
rank
ever
think
of
marriage
and
pray
what
has
your
heart
to
say
to
that
nothing
papa
replied
lady
juliana
in
a
faint
dejected
tone
of
voice
have
done
cupid
addressing
her
favourite
who
was
amusing
himself
in
pulling
and
tearing
the
beautiful
lace
veil
that
partly
shaded
the
head
of
his
fair
mistress
i
thought
not
resumed
the
earl
in
a
triumphant
tone
i
thought
not
indeed
and
as
this
victory
over
his
daughter
put
him
in
unusual
good
humour
he
condescended
to
sport
a
little
with
her
curiosity
and
pray
can
this
wonderful
wise
heart
of
yours
inform
you
who
it
is
you
are
going
to
obtain
for
a
husband
had
lady
juliana
dared
to
utter
the
wishes
of
that
heart
she
would
have
been
at
no
loss
for
a
reply
but
she
saw
the
necessity
of
dissimulation
and
after
naming
such
of
her
admirers
as
were
most
indifferent
to
her
she
declared
herself
quite
at
a
loss
and
begged
her
father
to
put
an
end
to
her
suspense
now
what
would
you
think
of
the
duke
of
l
asked
the
earl
in
a
voice
of
exultation
and
delight
the
duke
of
l
repeated
lady
juliana
with
a
scream
of
horror
and
surprise
surely
papa
you
can
not
be
serious
why
he
and
squints
and
he
as
old
as
you
if
he
were
as
old
as
the
devil
and
as
ugly
too
interrupted
the
enraged
earl
he
should
be
your
husband
and
may
i
perish
if
you
shall
have
any
other
the
youthful
beauty
burst
into
tears
while
her
father
traversed
the
apartment
with
an
inflamed
and
wrathful
visage
if
it
had
been
anybody
but
that
odious
duke
sobbed
the
lovely
juliana
if
it
had
been
anybody
but
that
odious
duke
repeated
the
earl
mimicking
her
they
should
not
have
had
you
it
has
been
my
sole
study
ever
since
i
saw
your
brother
settled
to
bring
about
this
alliance
and
when
this
is
accomplished
my
utmost
ambition
will
be
satisfied
so
no
more
whining
the
affair
is
settled
and
all
that
remains
for
you
to
do
is
to
study
to
make
yourself
agreeable
to
his
grace
and
to
sign
the
settlements
no
such
mighty
sacrifice
me
thinks
when
repaid
with
a
ducal
coronet
the
most
splendid
jewels
the
finest
equipages
and
the
largest
jointure
of
any
woman
in
england
lady
juliana
raised
her
head
and
wiped
her
eyes
lord
courtland
perceived
the
effect
his
eloquence
had
produced
upon
the
childish
fancy
of
his
daughter
and
continued
to
expatiate
upon
the
splendid
joys
that
awaited
her
in
a
union
with
a
nobleman
of
the
duke
rank
and
fortune
till
at
length
dazzled
if
not
convinced
she
declared
herself
satisfied
that
it
was
her
duty
to
marry
whoever
papa
pleased
but
and
a
sigh
escaped
her
as
she
contrasted
her
noble
suitor
with
her
handsome
lover
but
if
i
should
marry
him
papa
i
am
sure
i
shall
never
be
able
to
love
him
the
earl
smiled
at
her
childish
simplicity
as
he
assured
her
that
was
not
at
all
necessary
that
love
was
now
entirely
confined
to
the
that
it
was
very
well
for
ploughmen
and
dairymaids
to
marry
for
love
but
for
a
young
woman
of
rank
to
think
of
such
a
thing
was
plebeian
in
the
extreme
lady
juliana
did
not
entirely
subscribe
to
the
arguments
of
her
father
but
the
gay
and
glorious
vision
that
floated
in
her
brain
stifled
for
a
while
the
pleadings
of
her
heart
and
with
a
sparkling
eye
and
an
elastic
step
she
hastened
to
prepare
for
the
reception
of
the
duke
for
a
few
weeks
the
delusion
lasted
lady
juliana
was
flattered
with
the
homage
she
received
as
a
future
duchess
she
was
delighted
with
the
éclat
that
attended
her
and
charmed
with
the
daily
presents
showered
upon
her
by
her
noble
suitor
well
really
favolle
said
she
to
her
maid
one
day
as
she
clasped
on
her
beautiful
arm
a
resplendent
bracelet
it
must
be
owned
the
duke
has
a
most
exquisite
taste
in
trinkets
do
you
think
so
and
do
you
know
i
do
think
him
so
very
very
ugly
when
we
are
married
i
mean
to
make
him
get
a
brutus
cork
his
eyebrows
and
have
a
set
of
teeth
but
just
then
the
smiling
eyes
curling
hair
and
finely
formed
person
of
a
certain
captivating
scotsman
rose
to
view
in
her
mind
eye
and
with
a
peevish
pshaw
she
threw
the
bauble
aside
educated
for
the
sole
purpose
of
forming
a
brilliant
establishment
of
catching
the
eye
and
captivating
the
senses
the
cultivation
of
her
mind
or
the
correction
of
her
temper
had
formed
no
part
of
the
system
by
which
that
aim
was
to
be
accomplished
under
the
auspices
of
a
fashionable
mother
and
an
obsequious
governess
the
froward
petulance
of
childhood
fostered
and
strengthened
by
indulgence
and
submission
had
gradually
ripened
into
that
selfishness
and
caprice
which
now
in
youth
formed
the
prominent
features
of
her
character
the
earl
was
too
much
engrossed
by
affairs
of
importance
to
pay
much
attention
to
anything
so
perfectly
insignificant
as
the
mind
of
his
daughter
her
he
had
predetermined
should
be
entirely
at
his
disposal
and
therefore
contemplated
with
delight
the
uncommon
beauty
which
already
distinguished
it
not
with
the
fond
partiality
of
parental
love
but
with
the
heartless
satisfaction
of
a
crafty
politician
the
mind
of
lady
juliana
was
consequently
the
sport
of
every
passion
that
by
turns
assailed
it
now
swayed
by
ambition
and
now
softened
by
love
the
struggle
was
violent
but
it
was
short
a
few
days
before
the
one
which
was
to
seal
her
fate
she
granted
an
interview
to
her
lover
who
young
thoughtless
and
enamoured
as
herself
easily
succeeded
in
persuading
her
to
elope
with
him
to
scotland
there
at
the
altar
of
vulcan
the
beautiful
daughter
of
the
earl
of
courtland
gave
her
hand
to
her
handsome
but
penniless
lover
and
there
vowed
to
immolate
every
ambitious
desire
every
sentiment
of
vanity
and
pride
yet
a
sigh
arose
as
she
looked
on
the
filthy
hut
sooty
priest
and
ragged
witnesses
and
thought
of
the
special
license
splendid
saloon
and
bridal
pomp
that
would
have
attended
her
union
with
the
duke
but
the
rapturous
expressions
which
burst
from
the
impassioned
douglas
made
her
forget
the
gaudy
pleasures
of
pomp
and
fashion
amid
the
sylvan
scenes
of
the
neighbouring
lakes
the
lovers
sought
a
shelter
and
mutually
charmed
with
each
other
time
flew
for
a
while
on
downy
pinions
at
the
end
of
two
months
however
the
enamoured
husband
began
to
suspect
that
the
lips
of
his
angel
julia
could
utter
very
silly
things
while
the
fond
bride
on
her
part
discovered
that
though
her
adored
henry
figure
was
symmetry
itself
yet
it
certainly
was
deficient
in
a
certain
air
a
ne
sais
that
marks
the
man
of
fashion
how
i
wish
i
had
my
pretty
cupid
here
said
her
ladyship
with
a
sigh
one
day
as
she
lolled
on
a
sofa
he
had
so
many
pretty
tricks
he
would
have
helped
to
amuse
us
and
make
the
time
pass
for
really
this
place
grows
very
stupid
and
tiresome
do
you
think
so
love
most
confoundedly
so
my
darling
replied
her
husband
yawning
sympathetically
as
he
spoke
then
suppose
i
make
one
more
attempt
to
soften
papa
and
be
received
into
favour
again
with
all
my
heart
shall
i
say
i
very
sorry
for
what
i
have
done
asked
her
ladyship
with
a
sigh
you
know
i
did
not
say
that
in
my
first
letter
ay
do
and
if
it
will
serve
any
purpose
you
may
say
that
i
am
no
less
so
in
a
few
days
the
letter
was
returned
in
a
blank
cover
and
by
the
same
post
douglas
saw
himself
superseded
in
the
gazette
being
absent
without
leave
there
now
remained
but
one
course
to
pursue
and
that
was
to
seek
refuge
at
his
father
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
at
the
first
mention
of
it
lady
juliana
was
transported
with
joy
and
begged
that
a
letter
might
be
instantly
despatched
containing
the
offer
of
a
visit
she
had
heard
the
duchess
of
declare
nothing
could
be
so
delightful
as
the
style
of
living
in
scotland
the
people
were
so
frank
and
gay
and
the
manners
so
easy
and
engaging
oh
it
was
delightful
and
then
lady
jane
and
lady
mary
and
a
thousand
other
lords
and
ladies
she
knew
were
all
so
charmed
with
the
country
and
all
so
sorry
to
leave
it
then
dear
henry
family
must
be
so
charming
an
old
castle
too
was
her
delight
she
would
feel
quite
at
home
while
wandering
through
its
long
galleries
and
she
quite
loved
old
pictures
and
armour
and
tapestry
and
then
her
thoughts
reverted
to
her
father
magnificent
mansion
in
d
at
length
an
answer
arrived
containing
a
cordial
invitation
from
the
old
laird
to
spend
the
winter
with
them
at
glenfern
castle
all
impatience
to
quit
the
scenes
of
their
short
lived
felicity
they
bade
a
hasty
adieu
to
the
now
fading
beauties
of
windermere
and
full
of
hope
and
expectation
eagerly
turned
towards
the
bleak
hills
of
scotland
they
stopped
for
a
short
time
at
edinburgh
to
provide
themselves
with
a
carriage
and
some
other
necessaries
there
too
she
fortunately
met
with
an
english
abigail
and
footman
who
for
double
wages
were
prevailed
upon
to
attend
her
to
the
highlands
which
with
the
addition
of
two
dogs
a
tame
squirrel
and
mackaw
completed
the
establishment
chapter

what
transport
to
retrace
our
early
plays
our
easy
bliss

supplied
the

many
were
the
dreary
muirs
and
rugged
mountains
her
ladyship
had
to
encounter
in
her
progress
to
glenfern
castle
and
but
for
the
hope
of
the
new
world
that
awaited
her
beyond
those
formidable
barriers
her
delicate
frame
and
still
more
sensitive
feelings
must
have
sunk
beneath
the
horrors
of
such
a
journey
but
she
remembered
the
duchess
had
said
the
inns
and
roads
were
execrable
and
the
face
of
the
country
as
well
as
the
lower
orders
of
people
frightful
but
what
signified
those
things
there
were
balls
and
sailing
parties
and
rowing
matches
and
shooting
parties
and
fishing
parties
and
parties
of
every
description
and
the
certainty
of
being
recompensed
by
the
festivities
of
glenfern
castle
reconciled
her
to
the
ruggedness
of
the
approach
douglas
had
left
his
paternal
home
and
native
hills
when
only
eight
years
of
age
a
rich
relation
of
his
mother
happening
to
visit
them
at
that
time
took
a
fancy
to
the
boy
and
under
promise
of
making
him
his
heir
had
prevailed
on
his
parents
to
part
with
him
at
a
proper
age
he
was
placed
in
the
guards
and
had
continued
to
maintain
himself
in
the
favor
of
his
benefactor
until
his
imprudent
marriage
which
had
irritated
this
old
bachelor
so
much
that
he
instantly
disinherited
him
and
refused
to
listen
to
any
terms
of
reconciliation
the
impressions
which
the
scenes
of
his
infancy
had
left
upon
the
mind
of
the
young
scotsman
it
may
easily
be
supposed
were
of
a
pleasing
description
he
expatiated
to
his
juliana
on
the
wild
but
august
scenery
that
surrounded
his
father
castle
and
associated
with
the
idea
the
boyish
exploits
which
though
faintly
remembered
still
served
to
endear
them
to
his
heart
he
spoke
of
the
time
when
he
used
to
make
one
of
a
numerous
party
on
the
lake
and
when
tired
of
sailing
on
its
glassy
surface
to
the
sound
of
soft
music
they
would
land
at
some
lovely
spot
and
after
partaking
of
their
banquet
beneath
a
spreading
tree
conclude
the
day
by
a
dance
on
the
grass
lady
juliana
would
exclaim
how
delightful
i
doat
upon
picnics
and
dancing
henry
there
will
surely
be
a
ball
to
welcome
our
arrival
the
conversation
was
interrupted
for
just
at
that
moment
they
had
gained
the
summit
of
a
very
high
hill
and
the
stopping
to
give
his
horses
breath
turned
round
to
the
carriage
pointing
at
the
same
time
with
a
significant
gesture
to
a
tall
thin
gray
house
something
resembling
a
tower
that
stood
in
the
vale
beneath
a
small
lake
was
in
front
on
whose
banks
grew
neither
tree
nor
shrub
behind
rose
a
chain
of
rugged
hills
on
the
declivities
of
which
were
some
faint
attempts
at
young
plantations
and
the
only
level
ground
consisted
of
a
few
dingy
turnip
fields
enclosed
with
stone
walls
or
dykes
as
the
called
them
it
was
now
november
the
day
was
raw
and
cold
and
a
thick
drizzling
rain
was
beginning
to
fall
a
dreary
stillness
reigned
all
around
broken
only
at
intervals
by
the
screams
of
the
that
hovered
over
the
lake
on
whose
dark
and
troubled
waters
was
dimly
descried
a
little
boat
plied
by
one
solitary
being
what
a
scene
at
length
lady
juliana
exclaimed
shuddering
as
she
spoke
good
god
what
a
scene
how
i
pity
the
unhappy
wretches
who
are
doomed
to
dwell
in
such
a
place
and
yonder
hideous
grim
house
it
makes
me
sick
to
look
at
it
for
heaven
sake
bid
him
drive
on
another
significant
look
from
the
driver
made
the
colour
mount
to
cheek
as
he
stammered
out
surely
it
ca
be
yet
somehow
i
know
pray
my
lad
setting
down
one
of
the
glasses
and
addressing
the
what
is
the
name
of
that
house
hoose
repeated
the
driver
ca
ye
thon
a
hoose
thon
gude
glenfern
castle
lady
juliana
not
understanding
a
word
he
said
sat
silently
wondering
at
her
husband
curiosity
respecting
such
a
place
impossible
you
must
be
mistaken
my
lad
why
what
become
of
all
the
fine
wood
that
used
to
surround
it
gin
you
mean
a
wheen
auld
firs
there
some
of
them
to
the
fore
yet
pointing
to
two
or
three
tall
bare
scathed
scotch
firs
that
scarcely
bent
their
stubborn
heads
to
the
wind
that
now
began
to
howl
around
them
i
insist
upon
it
that
you
are
mistaken
you
must
have
wandered
from
the
right
road
cried
the
now
alarmed
douglas
in
a
loud
voice
which
vainly
attempted
to
conceal
his
agitation
we
shune
see
that
replied
the
phlegmatic
scot
who
having
rested
his
horses
and
affixed
a
drag
to
the
wheel
was
about
to
proceed
when
lady
juliana
who
now
began
to
have
some
vague
suspicion
of
the
truth
called
to
him
to
stop
and
almost
breathless
with
alarm
inquired
of
her
husband
the
meaning
of
what
had
passed
he
tried
to
force
a
smile
as
he
said
it
seems
our
journey
is
nearly
ended
that
fellow
persists
in
asserting
that
that
is
glenfern
though
i
can
scarcely
think
it
if
it
is
it
is
strangely
altered
since
i
left
it
twelve
years
ago
for
a
moment
lady
juliana
was
too
much
alarmed
to
make
a
reply
pale
and
speechless
she
sank
back
in
the
carriage
but
the
motion
of
it
as
it
began
to
proceed
roused
her
to
a
sense
of
her
situation
and
she
burst
into
tears
and
exclamations
the
driver
who
attributed
it
all
to
fears
at
descending
the
hill
assured
her
she
need
na
be
the
least
feared
for
there
were
na
twa
cannier
beasts
atween
that
and
johnny
groat
hoose
and
that
they
wad
her
at
the
castle
door
in
a
crack
gin
they
were
ance
down
the
brae
douglas
attempts
to
soothe
his
bride
were
not
more
successful
than
those
of
the
driver
in
vain
he
made
use
of
every
endearing
epithet
and
tender
expression
and
recalled
the
time
when
she
used
to
declare
that
she
could
dwell
with
him
in
a
desert
her
only
replies
were
bitter
reproaches
and
upbraidings
for
his
treachery
and
deceit
mingled
with
floods
of
tears
and
interrupted
by
hysterical
sobs
provoked
at
her
folly
yet
softened
by
her
extreme
distress
douglas
was
in
the
utmost
state
of
perplexity
now
ready
to
give
way
to
a
paroxysm
of
rage
then
yielding
to
the
natural
goodness
of
his
heart
he
sought
to
soothe
her
into
composure
and
at
length
with
much
difficulty
succeeded
in
changing
her
passionate
indignation
into
silent
dejection
that
no
fresh
objects
of
horror
or
disgust
might
appear
to
disturb
this
calm
the
blinds
were
pulled
down
and
in
this
state
they
reached
glenfern
castle
but
there
the
friendly
veil
was
necessarily
withdrawn
and
the
first
object
that
presented
itself
to
the
highbred
englishwoman
was
an
old
man
clad
in
a
short
tartan
coat
and
striped
woollen
with
blear
eyes
and
shaking
hands
who
vainly
strove
to
open
the
carriage
door
douglas
soon
extricated
himself
and
assisted
his
lady
to
alight
then
accosting
the
venerable
domestic
as
old
donald
asked
him
if
he
recollected
him
weel
that
weel
that
maister
hairy
and
ye
welcome
hame
and
ye
tu
bonny
sir
addressing
lady
juliana
who
was
calling
to
her
footman
to
follow
her
with
the
mackaw
then
tottering
before
them
he
led
the
way
while
her
ladyship
followed
leaning
on
her
husband
her
squirrel
on
her
other
arm
preceded
by
her
dogs
barking
with
all
their
might
and
attended
by
the
mackaw
screaming
with
all
his
strength
and
in
this
state
was
the
lady
juliana
ushered
into
the
of
glenfern
castle
the
highlanders
use
this
term
of
respect
indifferently
to
both
sexes
chapter
iii
what
can
be
worse
than
to
dwell
here
it
was
a
long
narrow
room
with
a
number
of
small
windows
that
admitted
feeble
lights
in
every
possible
direction
the
scanty
furniture
bore
every
appearance
of
having
been
constructed
at
the
same
time
as
the
edifice
and
the
friendship
thus
early
formed
still
seemed
to
subsist
as
the
worked
chairs
adhered
most
pertinaciously
to
the
gray
walls
on
which
hung
in
narrow
black
frames
some
of
the
venerable
ancestors
of
the
douglas
family
a
fire
which
appeared
to
have
been
newly
kindled
was
beginning
to
burn
but
previous
to
showing
itself
in
flame
had
chosen
to
vent
itself
in
smoke
with
which
the
room
was
completely
filled
and
the
open
windows
seemed
to
produce
no
other
effect
than
that
of
admitting
the
rain
and
wind
at
the
entrance
of
the
stranger
a
flock
of
females
rushed
forward
to
meet
them
douglas
good
humouredly
submitted
to
be
hugged
by
three
spinsters
whom
he
recognised
as
his
aunts
and
warmly
saluted
five
awkward
purple
girls
he
guessed
to
be
his
sisters
while
lady
julian
stood
the
image
of
despair
and
scarcely
conscious
admitted
in
silence
the
civilities
of
her
new
relations
till
at
length
sinking
into
a
chair
she
endeavoured
to
conceal
her
agitation
by
calling
to
the
dogs
and
caressing
her
mackaw
the
laird
who
had
been
hastily
summoned
from
his
farming
operations
now
entered
he
was
a
good
looking
old
man
with
something
the
air
of
a
gentleman
in
spite
of
the
inelegance
of
his
dress
his
rough
manner
and
provincial
accent
after
warmly
welcoming
his
son
he
advanced
to
his
beautiful
and
taking
her
in
his
arms
bestowed
a
loud
and
hearty
kiss
on
each
cheek
then
observing
the
paleness
of
her
complexion
and
the
tears
that
swam
in
her
eyes
what
not
frightened
for
our
hieland
hills
my
leddy
come
cheer
up
trust
me
ye
find
as
warm
hearts
among
them
as
ony
ye
left
in
your
fine
english
shaking
her
delicate
fingers
in
his
hard
muscular
gripe
as
he
spoke
the
tears
which
had
with
difficulty
been
hitherto
suppressed
now
burst
in
torrents
from
the
eyes
of
the
beauty
as
she
leant
her
cheek
against
the
back
of
a
chair
and
gave
way
to
the
anguish
which
mocked
control
to
the
loud
anxious
inquiries
and
oppressive
kindness
of
her
homely
relatives
she
made
no
reply
but
stretching
out
her
hands
to
her
husband
sobbed
take
oh
take
me
from
this
place
mortified
ashamed
and
provoked
at
a
behavior
so
childish
and
absurd
douglas
could
only
stammer
out
something
about
lady
juliana
having
been
frightened
and
fatigued
and
requesting
to
be
shown
to
their
apartment
he
supported
her
almost
lifeless
to
it
while
his
aunts
followed
all
three
prescribing
different
remedies
in
a
breath
for
heaven
sake
take
them
from
me
faintly
articulated
lady
juliana
as
she
shrank
from
the
many
hands
that
were
alternately
applied
to
her
pulse
and
forehead
after
repeated
entreaties
and
plausible
excuses
from
douglas
his
aunts
at
length
consented
to
withdraw
and
he
then
exerted
all
the
rhetoric
he
was
master
of
to
reconcile
his
bride
to
the
situation
love
and
necessity
had
thrown
her
into
but
in
vain
he
employed
reasoning
caresses
and
threats
the
only
answers
he
could
extort
were
tears
and
entreaties
to
be
taken
from
a
place
where
she
declared
she
felt
it
impossible
to
exist
if
you
wish
my
death
harry
said
she
in
a
voice
almost
inarticulate
from
excess
of
weeping
oh
kill
me
quickly
and
do
not
leave
me
to
linger
out
my
days
and
perish
at
last
with
misery
here
for
heaven
sake
tell
me
what
you
would
have
me
do
said
her
husband
softened
to
pity
by
her
extreme
distress
and
i
swear
that
in
everything
possible
i
will
comply
with
your
wishes
oh
fly
then
stop
the
horses
and
let
us
return
immediately
do
run
dearest
harry
or
they
will
be
gone
and
we
shall
never
get
away
from
this
odious
place
where
would
you
go
asked
he
with
affected
calmness
oh
anywhere
no
matter
where
so
as
we
do
but
get
away
from
hence
we
can
be
at
no
loss
none
in
the
world
interrupted
douglas
with
a
bitter
smile
as
long
as
there
is
a
prison
to
receive
us
see
continued
he
throwing
a
few
shillings
down
on
the
table
there
is
every
sixpence
i
possess
in
the
world
so
help
me
heaven
lady
juliana
stood
aghast
at
that
instant
the
english
abigail
burst
into
the
room
and
in
a
voice
choking
with
passion
she
requested
her
discharge
that
she
might
return
with
the
driver
who
had
brought
them
there
a
pretty
way
of
travelling
to
be
sure
it
will
be
continued
she
to
go
bumping
behind
a
dirty
but
better
to
be
shook
to
a
jelly
altogether
than
stay
amongst
such
a
set
of
hottentots
what
do
you
mean
inquired
douglas
as
soon
as
the
voluble
abigail
allowed
him
an
opportunity
of
asking
why
my
meaning
sir
is
to
leave
this
here
place
immediately
not
that
i
have
any
objections
either
to
my
lady
or
you
sir
but
to
be
sure
it
was
a
sad
day
for
me
that
i
engaged
myself
to
her
ladyship
little
did
i
think
that
a
lady
of
distinction
would
coming
to
such
a
poor
pitiful
place
as
this
i
am
sure
i
thought
i
should
ha
swooned
when
i
was
showed
the
hole
where
i
was
to
sleep
at
the
bare
idea
of
this
indignity
to
her
person
the
fury
of
the
incensed
fair
one
blazed
forth
with
such
strength
as
to
choke
her
utterance
amazement
had
hitherto
kept
lady
juliana
silent
for
to
such
scenes
she
was
a
stranger
born
in
an
elevated
rank
reared
in
state
accustomed
to
the
most
obsequious
attention
and
never
approached
but
with
the
respect
due
rather
to
a
than
to
a
mortal
the
strain
of
vulgar
insolence
that
now
assailed
her
was
no
less
new
to
her
ears
than
shocking
to
her
feelings
with
a
voice
and
look
that
awed
the
woman
in
to
obedience
she
commanded
her
to
quit
her
presence
for
ever
and
then
no
longer
able
to
suppress
the
motions
of
insulted
pride
wounded
vanity
and
indignant
disappointment
she
gave
way
to
a
violent
fit
of
hysterics
in
the
utmost
perplexity
the
unfortunate
husband
by
turns
cursed
the
hour
that
had
given
him
such
a
wife
now
tried
to
soothe
her
into
composure
but
at
length
seriously
alarmed
at
the
increasing
attack
he
called
loudly
for
assistance
in
a
moment
the
three
aunts
and
the
five
sisters
all
rushed
together
into
the
room
full
of
wonder
exclamation
and
inquiry
many
were
the
remedies
that
were
tried
and
the
experiments
that
were
suggested
and
at
length
the
violence
of
passion
exhausted
itself
and
a
faint
sob
or
deep
sigh
succeeded
the
hysteric
scream
douglas
now
attempted
to
account
for
the
behaviour
of
his
noble
spouse
by
ascribing
it
to
the
fatigue
she
had
lately
undergone
joined
to
distress
of
mind
at
her
father
unrelenting
severity
towards
her
oh
the
amiable
creature
interrupted
the
unsuspecting
spinsters
almost
stifling
her
with
their
caresses
as
they
spoke
welcome
a
thousand
times
welcome
to
glenfern
castle
said
miss
jacky
who
was
esteemed
by
much
the
most
sensible
woman
as
well
as
the
greatest
orator
in
the
whole
parish
nothing
shall
be
wanting
dearest
lady
juliana
to
compensate
for
a
parent
rigour
and
make
you
happy
and
comfortable
consider
this
as
your
future
home
my
sisters
and
myself
will
be
as
mothers
to
you
and
see
these
charming
young
creatures
dragging
forward
two
tall
frightened
girls
with
sandy
hair
and
great
purple
arms
thank
providence
for
having
blest
you
with
such
sisters
do
speak
too
much
jacky
to
our
dear
niece
at
present
said
miss
grizzy
i
think
one

lady
maclaughlan

draughts

be
the
best
thing
for
her
composing
draughts

this
time
of
day
cried
miss

few

little

asked
douglas
his
lady
assented
and
miss
nicky
vanished
but
quickly
followed
by
tibby
carrying
a
huge
bowl
of
coarse
broth
swimming
with
leeks
greens
and
grease
lady
juliana
attempted
to
taste
it
but
her
delicate
palate
revolted
at
the
homely
fare
and
she
gave
up
the
attempt
in
spite
of
miss
nicky
earnest
entreaties
to
take
a
few
more
of
these
excellent
family
broth
i
should
think
said
henry
as
he
vainly
attempted
to
stir
it
round
that
a
little
wine
would
be
more
to
the
purpose
than
this
stuff
the
aunts
looked
at
each
other
and
withdrawing
to
a
corner
a
whispering
consultation
took
place
in
which
lady
maclaughlan
opinion
birch
balm
currant
heating
cooling
running
risks
etc
transpired
at
length
the
question
was
carried
and
some
tolerable
sherry
and
a
piece
of
very
substantial
were
produced
it
was
now
voted
by
miss
jacky
and
carried
that
her
ladyship
ought
to
take
a
little
repose
till
the
hour
of
dinner
and
do
trouble
to
dress
continued
the
considerate
aunt
for
we
are
not
very
dressy
here
and
we
are
to
be
quite
a
charming
family
party
nobody
but
ourselves
and
turning
to
her
nephew
your
brother
and
his
wife
she
is
a
most
superior
woman
though
she
has
rather
too
many
of
her
english
prejudices
yet
to
be
all
we
could
wish
but
i
have
no
doubt
when
she
has
lived
a
little
longer
amongst
us
she
will
just
become
one
of
ourselves
i
forget
who
she
was
said
douglas
a
of
sir
duncan
malcolm
a
very
old
family
of
the
blood
and
nearly
allied
to
the
present
earl
and
here
they
come
exclaimed
she
on
hearing
the
sound
of
a
carriage
and
all
rushed
out
to
receive
them
let
us
have
a
glimpse
of
this
scion
from
a
noble
stock
said
lady
juliana
mimicking
the
accent
of
the
poor
spinsters
as
she
rose
and
ran
to
the
window
good
heavens
henry
do
come
and
behold
this
equipage
and
she
laughed
with
childish
glee
as
she
pointed
to
a
plain
whisky
with
a
large
top
a
tall
handsome
young
man
now
alighted
and
lifted
out
a
female
figure
so
enveloped
in
a
cloak
that
eyes
less
penetrating
than
lady
juliana
could
not
at
a
single
glance
have
discovered
her
to
be
a
frightful
quiz
only
conceive
the
effect
of
this
dashing
equipage
in
bond
street
continued
she
redoubling
her
mirth
at
the
bright
idea
then
suddenly
stopping
and
sighing
ah
my
pretty
i
remember
the
first
time
i
saw
you
henry
i
was
in
it
at
a
review
and
she
sighed
still
deeper
true
i
was
then
to
your
handsome
lover
the
duke
of
l
perhaps
i
might
think
him
handsome
now
people
tastes
alter
according
to
circumstances
yours
must
have
undergone
a
wonderful
revolution
if
you
can
find
charms
in
a
hunchback
of
fifty
three
he
is
not
a
hunchback
returned
her
ladyship
warmly
only
a
little
high
shouldered
but
at
any
rate
he
has
the
most
beautiful
place
and
the
finest
house
in
england
douglas
saw
the
storm
gathering
on
the
brow
of
his
capricious
wife
and
clasping
her
in
his
arms
are
you
indeed
so
changed
my
julia
that
you
have
forgot
the
time
when
you
used
to
declare
you
would
prefer
a
desert
with
your
henry
to
a
throne
with
another
no
certainly
not
changed
but
i
i
did
not
very
well
know
then
what
a
desert
was
or
at
least
i
had
formed
rather
a
different
idea
of
it
what
was
your
idea
of
a
desert
said
her
husband
laughing
do
tell
me
love
oh
i
had
fancied
it
a
beautiful
place
full
of
roses
and
myrtles
and
smooth
green
turf
and
murmuring
rivulets
and
though
very
retired
not
absolutely
out
of
the
world
where
one
could
occasionally
see
friends
and
give
et
fêtes
well
perhaps
the
time
may
come
juliana
when
we
may
realise
your
elysian
deserts
but
at
present
you
know
i
am
wholly
dependent
on
my
father
i
hope
to
prevail
on
him
to
do
something
for
me
and
that
our
stay
here
will
be
short
as
you
may
be
sure
the
moment
i
can
i
will
take
you
hence
i
am
sensible
it
is
not
a
situation
for
you
but
for
my
sake
dearest
juliana
bear
with
it
for
a
while
without
betraying
your
disgust
will
you
do
this
darling
and
he
kissed
away
the
sullen
tear
that
hung
on
her
cheek
you
know
love
there
nothing
in
the
world
i
would
do
for
you
replied
she
as
she
played
with
her
squirrel
and
as
you
promise
our
stay
shall
be
short
if
i
do
die
of
the
horrors
i
shall
certainly
try
to
make
the
agreeable
oh
my
cherub
flying
to
her
pug
who
came
barking
into
the
room
where
have
you
been
and
where
my
darling
psyche
and
sweet
mackaw
do
harry
go
and
see
after
the
darlings
i
must
go
and
see
my
brother
and
his
wife
first
will
you
come
love
oh
not
now
i
do
feel
equal
to
the
encounter
besides
i
must
dress
but
what
shall
i
do
since
that
vile
woman
gone
i
ca
dress
myself
i
never
did
such
a
thing
in
my
life
and
i
am
sure
it
impossible
that
i
can
almost
weeping
at
the
hardships
she
was
doomed
to
experience
in
making
her
own
toilet
shall
i
be
your
abigail
asked
her
husband
smiling
at
the
distress
me
thinks
it
would
be
no
difficult
task
to
deck
my
julia
dear
harry
will
you
really
dress
me
oh
that
will
be
delightful
i
shall
die
with
laughing
at
your
awkwardness
and
her
beautiful
eyes
sparkled
with
childish
delight
at
the
idea
in
the
meantime
said
douglas
i
send
someone
to
unpack
your
things
and
after
i
have
shook
hands
with
archie
and
been
introduced
to
my
new
sister
i
shall
enter
on
my
office
now
do
pray
make
haste
for
i
die
to
see
your
great
hands
tying
strings
and
sticking
pins
delighted
with
her
gaiety
and
good
humour
he
left
her
caressing
her
favourites
and
finding
rather
a
scarcity
of
female
attendance
he
despatched
two
of
his
sisters
to
assist
his
helpless
beauty
in
her
arrangements
chapter
iv
and
ever
against
eating
cares
lap
me
in
soft
lydian
airs
when
douglas
returned
he
found
the
floor
strewed
with
dresses
of
every
description
his
sisters
on
their
knees
before
a
great
trunk
they
were
busied
in
unpacking
and
his
lady
in
her
wrapper
with
her
hair
about
her
ears
still
amusing
herself
with
her
pets
see
how
good
your
sisters
are
said
she
pointing
to
the
poor
girls
whose
inflamed
faces
bore
testimony
to
their
labours
i
declare
i
am
quite
sorry
to
see
them
take
so
much
trouble
yawning
as
she
leant
back
in
her
chair
is
it
not
quite
shocking
tommy
her
squirrel
oh
pray
henry
do
tell
me
what
i
am
to
put
on
for
i
protest
i
know
favolle
always
used
to
choose
for
me
and
so
did
that
odious
martin
for
she
had
an
exquisite
taste
not
so
exquisite
as
your
own
i
am
sure
so
for
once
choose
for
yourself
replied
the
husband
and
pray
make
haste
for
my
father
waits
dinner
betwixt
scolding
laughing
and
blundering
the
dress
was
at
length
completed
and
lady
juliana
in
all
the
pomp
of
dress
and
pride
of
beauty
descended
leaning
on
her
husband
arm
on
entering
the
which
was
now
in
a
more
comfortable
state
douglas
led
her
to
a
lady
who
was
sitting
by
the
fire
and
placing
her
hand
within
that
of
the
stranger
juliana
my
love
said
he
this
is
a
sister
whom
you
have
not
yet
seen
a
with
whom
i
am
sure
you
will
gladly
make
acquaintance
the
stranger
received
her
noble
sister
with
graceful
ease
and
with
a
sweet
smile
and
pleasing
accent
expressed
herself
happy
in
the
introduction
lady
juliana
was
surprised
and
somewhat
disconcerted
she
had
arranged
her
plans
and
made
up
her
mind
to
be
she
had
resolved
to
enchant
by
her
sweetness
dazzle
by
her
brilliancy
and
overpower
by
her
affability
but
there
was
a
simple
dignity
in
the
air
and
address
of
the
lady
before
which
even
affectation
sank
abashed
before
she
found
a
reply
to
the
courteous
yet
respectful
salutation
of
her
douglas
introduced
his
brother
and
the
old
gentleman
impatient
at
any
farther
delay
taking
lady
juliana
by
the
hand
pulled
rather
than
led
her
into
the
even
lady
juliana
contrived
to
make
a
meal
of
the
roast
mutton
and
moorfowl
for
the
laird
piqued
himself
on
the
breed
of
his
sheep
and
his
son
was
to
good
a
sportsman
to
allow
his
friends
to
want
for
game
i
think
my
darling
tommy
would
relish
this
grouse
very
much
observed
lady
juliana
as
she
secured
the
last
remaining
wing
for
her
favourite
bring
him
here
turning
to
the
tall
dashing
lackey
who
stood
behind
her
chair
and
whose
handsome
livery
and
hair
formed
a
striking
contrast
to
old
donald
tartan
jacket
and
come
hither
my
sweetest
cherubs
extending
her
arms
towards
the
charming
trio
as
they
entered
barking
and
chattering
and
flying
to
their
mistress
a
scene
of
noise
and
nonsense
ensued
douglas
remained
silent
mortified
and
provoked
at
the
weakness
of
his
wife
which
not
even
the
silver
tones
of
her
voice
or
the
elegance
of
her
manners
could
longer
conceal
from
him
but
still
there
was
a
charm
in
her
very
folly
to
the
eye
of
love
which
had
not
yet
wholly
lost
its
power
after
the
table
was
cleared
observing
that
he
was
still
silent
and
abstracted
lady
juliana
turned
to
her
husband
and
laying
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
you
are
not
well
love
said
she
looking
up
in
his
face
and
shaking
back
the
redundant
ringlets
that
shaded
her
own
perfectly
so
replied
her
husband
with
a
sigh
what
dull
then
i
must
sing
to
enliven
you
and
leaning
her
head
on
his
shoulder
she
warbled
a
verse
of
the
beautiful
little
venetian
air
biondina
in
then
suddenly
stopping
and
fixing
her
eyes
on
douglas
i
beg
pardon
perhaps
you
do
like
music
perhaps
my
singing
a
bore
you
pay
us
a
bad
compliment
in
saying
so
said
her
smiling
and
the
only
atonement
you
can
make
for
such
an
injurious
doubt
is
to
proceed
does
anybody
sing
here
asked
she
without
noticing
this
request
do
somebody
sing
me
a
song
oh
we
all
sing
and
dance
too
said
one
of
the
old
young
ladies
and
after
tea
we
will
show
you
some
of
our
scotch
steps
but
in
the
meantime
douglas
will
favour
us
with
her
song
douglas
assented
though
aware
that
it
would
be
rather
a
nice
point
to
please
all
parties
in
the
choice
of
a
song
the
laird
reckoned
all
foreign
music
everything
that
was
not
scotch
an
outrage
upon
his
ears
and
douglas
had
too
much
taste
to
murder
scotch
songs
with
her
english
accent
she
therefore
compromised
the
matter
as
well
as
she
could
by
selecting
a
highland
ditty
clothed
in
her
own
native
tongue
and
sang
with
much
pathos
and
simplicity
the
lamented
leyden
fall
of
macgregor
in
the
vale
of
glenorehy
the
night
breeze
was
sighing
the
tomb
where
the
ancient
macgregors
are
lying
green
are
their
graves
by
their
soft
murmuring
river
but
the
name
of
macgregor
has
perished
for
ever
on
a
red
stream
of
light
by
his
gray
mountains
glancing
soon
i
beheld
a
dim
spirit
advancing
slow
the
heath
of
the
dead
was
its
motion
like
the
shadow
of
mist
the
foam
of
the
ocean
like
the
sound
of
a
stream
through
the
still
evening
dying
stranger
who
treads
where
macgregor
is
lying
darest
thou
to
walk
unappall
and
the
shadowy
steps
of
the
mighty
departed
see
round
thee
the
caves
of
the
dead
are
disclosing
the
shades
that
have
long
been
in
silence
reposing
thro
their
forms
dimly
twinkles
the
descending
as
upon
thee
their
red
eyes
of
wrath
they
are
bending
our
gray
stones
of
fame
though
the
cover
round
the
fields
of
our
battles
our
spirits
still
hover
where
we
oft
saw
the
streams
running
red
from
the
mountains
but
dark
are
our
forms
by
our
blue
native
fountains
for
our
fame
melts
away
like
the
foam
of
the
river
like
the
last
yellow
leaves
on
the
that
shiver
the
name
is
unknown
of
our
fathers
so
gallant
and
our
blood
beats
no
more
in
the
breasts
of
the
valiant
the
hunter
of
red
deer
now
ceases
to
number
the
lonely
gray
stones
on
the
field
of
our
fly
stranger
and
let
not
thine
eye
be
reverted
why
thou
see
that
our
fame
is
departed
pray
do
you
play
on
the
harp
asked
the
volatile
lady
scarcely
waiting
till
the
first
stanza
was
ended
and
have
you
a
good
harp
here
we
a
very
sweet
spinnet
said
miss
jacky
which
in
my
opinion
is
a
far
superior
instrument
and
bella
will
give
us
a
tune
upon
it
bella
my
dear
let
lady
juliana
hear
how
well
you
can
play
bella
blushing
like
a
peony
rose
retired
to
a
corner
of
the
room
where
stood
the
spinnet
and
with
great
heavy
trembling
hands
began
to
belabour
the
unfortunate
instrument
while
the
aunts
beat
time
and
encouraged
her
to
proceed
with
exclamations
of
admiration
and
applause
you
have
done
very
well
bella
said
douglas
seeing
her
preparing
to
another
piece
and
pitying
the
poor
girl
as
well
as
her
auditors
then
whispering
miss
jacky
that
lady
juliana
looked
fatigued
they
arose
to
quit
the
room
give
me
your
arm
love
to
the
said
her
ladyship
languidly
and
now
pray
do
be
long
away
continued
she
as
he
placed
her
on
the
sofa
and
returned
to
the
gentlemen
chapter
you
have
displaced
the
mirth
broke
the
good
meeting
with
most
admired
disorder
the
interval
which
seemed
of
endless
duration
to
the
hapless
lady
juliana
was
passed
by
the
aunts
in
giving
sage
counsel
as
to
the
course
of
life
to
be
pursued
by
married
ladies
worsted
stockings
and
quilted
petticoats
were
insisted
upon
as
indispensable
articles
of
dress
while
it
was
plainly
insinuated
that
it
was
utterly
impossible
any
child
could
be
healthy
whose
mother
had
not
confined
her
wishes
to
barley
broth
and
oatmeal
porridge
only
look
at
thae
young
lambs
said
miss
grizzy
pointing
to
the
five
great
girls
see
what
pickters
of
health
they
are
i
sure
i
hope
my
dear
niece
your
children
will
be
just
the
same
only
boys
for
we
are
sadly
in
want
of
boys
it
melancholy
to
think
we
have
not
a
boy
among
us
and
that
a
fine
auntient
race
like
ours
should
be
dying
away
for
want
of
male
heirs
and
the
tears
streamed
down
the
cheeks
of
the
good
spinster
as
she
spoke
the
entrance
of
the
gentlemen
put
a
stop
to
the
conversation
flying
to
her
husband
lady
juliana
began
to
whisper
in
very
audible
tones
her
inquires
whether
he
had
yet
got
any
money
when
they
were
to
go
away
etc
etc
does
your
ladyship
choose
any
tea
asked
miss
nicky
as
she
disseminated
the
little
cups
of
coarse
black
liquid
tea
oh
no
i
never
drink
tea
i
take
some
coffee
though
and
psyche
doats
on
a
dish
of
tea
and
she
tendered
the
beverage
that
had
been
intended
for
herself
to
her
favourite
here
no
coffee
said
douglas
surveying
the
but
i
will
ring
for
some
as
he
pulled
the
bell
old
donald
answered
the
summons
where
the
coffee
demanded
miss
nicky
the
coffee
repeated
the
highlander
troth
miss
nicky
an
it
been
clean
forgot
well
but

get
it
yet
said
douglas
maister
harry
the
night
owre
far

noo
for
the
fire
a
up

reckoning
with
his
fingers

proceeded
there

makin
for
oor
supper
and
there
patatees
boiling
for
the
beasts
and
i
see
about
it
myself
said
miss
nicky
leaving
the
room
with
old
donald
at
her
back
muttering
all
the
way
the
old
laird
all
this
while
had
been
enjoying
his
evening
nap
but
that
now
ended
and
the
tea
equipage
being
dismissed
starting
up
he
asked
what
they
were
about
that
the
dancing
was
not
begun
come
my
leddy
we
set
the
example
snapping
his
fingers
and
singing
in
a
hoarse
voice
the
mouse
is
a
merry
beastie
and
the
moudiwort
wants
the

but
folk
sail
get

merry
as
we
twa
been
but
whar
the
girlies
cried

ho
belle
becky
betty
baby
beeny
to
your
posts
the
young
ladies
eager
for
the
delights
of
music
and
dancing
now
entered
followed
by
coil
the
piper
dressed
in
the
native
garb
with
cheeks
seemingly
ready
blown
for
the
occasion
after
a
little
strutting
and
puffing
the
pipes
were
fairly
set
a
going
in
coil
most
spirited
manner
but
vain
would
be
the
attempt
to
describe
lady
juliana
horror
and
amazement
at
the
hideous
sounds
that
for
the
first
time
assailed
her
ear
tearing
herself
from
the
grasp
of
the
old
gentleman
who
was
just
setting
off
in
the
reel
she
flew
shrieking
to
her
husband
and
threw
herself
trembling
into
his
arms
while
he
called
loudly
to
the
self
delighted
coil
to
stop
what
the
matter
what
the
matter
cried
the
whole
family
gathering
round
matter
repeated
douglas
furiously
you
have
frightened
lady
juliana
to
death
with
your
infernal
music
what
did
you
mean
turning
fiercely
to
the
astonished
piper
by
blowing
that
confounded
bladder
poor
coil
gaped
with
astonishment
for
never
before
had
his
performance
on
the
bagpipe
been
heard
but
with
admiration
and
applause
a
bonny
bargain
indeed
that
canna
stand
the
pipes
said
the
old
gentleman
as
he
went
puffing
up
and
down
the
room
she
no
the
wife
for
a
heelandman
confoonded
blather
indeed
by
my
faith
ye
no
blate
i
declare
it
the
most
distressing
thing
i
ever
met
with
sighed
miss
grizzy
i
wonder
whether
it
could
be
the
sight
or
the
sound
of
the
bagpipe
that
frightened
our
dear
niece
i
wish
to
goodness
lady
maclaughlan
was
here
it
impossible
the
bagpipe
could
frighten
anybody
said
miss
jacky
in
a
high
key
nobody
with
common
sense
could
be
frightened
at
a
bagpipe
douglas
here
mildly
interposed
and
soothed
down
the
offended
pride
of
the
highlanders
by
attributing
lady
juliana
agitation
entirely
to
the
word
operated
like
a
charm
all
were
ready
to
admit
that
it
was
a
surprising
thing
when
heard
for
the
first
time
miss
jacky
remarked
that
we
are
all
liable
to
be
surprised
and
the
still
more
sapient
grizzy
said
that
indeed
it
was
most
surprising
the
effect
that
surprise
had
upon
some
people
for
her
own
part
she
could
not
deny
but
that
she
was
very
often
frightened
when
she
was
surprised
douglas
meanwhile
was
employed
in
soothing
the
terrors
real
or
affected
of
his
delicate
bride
who
declared
herself
so
exhausted
with
the
fatigue
she
had
undergone
and
the
sufferings
she
had
endured
that
she
must
retire
for
the
night
henry
eager
to
escape
from
the
questions
and
remarks
of
his
family
gladly
availed
himself
of
the
same
excuse
and
to
the
infinite
mortification
of
both
aunts
and
nieces
the
ball
was
broken
up

the
remarks

in
the
parlour
upon
the
new
married
couple
has
not
reached
the
writer
of
these
memoirs
with
as
much
exactness
as
the
foregoing
circumstances
but
they
may
in
part
be
imagined
from
the
sketch
already
given
of
the
characters
which
formed
the
glenfern
party
the
conciliatory
indulgence
of
douglas
when
aided
by
the
miss
grizzy
doubtless
had
a
favourable
effect
on
the
irritated
pride
but
acrimony
of
the
old
gentleman
certain
it
is
that
before
the
evening
concluded
they
appeared
all
restored
to
harmony
and
retired
to
their
respective
chambers
in
hopes
of
beholding
a
more
propitious
morrow
who
has
not
perused
sonnets
odes
and
speeches
in
praise
of
that
balmy
blessing
sleep
from
the
divine
effusions
of
shakespeare
down
to
the
drowsy
notes
of
newspaper
poets
yet
can
not
too
much
be
said
in
its
commendation
sweet
is
its
influence
on
the
careworn
eyes
to
tears
accustomed
in
its
arms
the
statesman
forgets
his
harassed
thoughts
the
weary
and
the
poor
are
blessed
with
its
charms
and
conscience
even
conscience
is
sometimes
soothed
into
silence
while
the
sufferer
sleeps
but
nowhere
perhaps
is
its
influence
more
happily
felt
than
in
the
heart
oppressed
by
the
harassing
accumulation
of
petty
ills
like
a
troop
of
locusts
making
up
by
their
number
and
their
stings
what
they
want
in
magnitude
mortified
pride
in
discovering
the
fallacy
of
our
own
judgment
to
be
ashamed
of
what
we
love
yet
still
to
love
are
feelings
most
unpleasant
and
though
they
assume
not
the
dignity
of
deep
distress
yet
philosophy
has
scarce
any
power
to
soothe
their
worrying
incessant
annoyance
douglas
was
glad
to
forget
himself
in
sleep
he
had
thought
a
vast
deal
that
day
and
of
unpleasant
subjects
more
than
the
whole
of
his
foregoing
life
would
have
produced
if
he
did
not
curse
the
fair
object
of
his
imprudence
he
at
least
cursed
his
own
folly
and
himself
and
these
were
his
last
waking
thoughts
but
douglas
could
not
repose
as
long
as
the
seven
sleepers
and
in
consequence
of
having
retired
sooner
to
bed
than
he
was
accustomed
to
do
he
waked
at
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
the
wonderful
activity
which
people
sometimes
feel
when
they
have
little
to
do
with
their
bodies
and
less
with
their
minds
caused
him
to
rise
hastily
and
dress
hoping
to
pick
up
a
new
set
of
ideas
by
virtue
of
his
locomotive
powers
on
descending
to
the
he
found
his
father
seated
at
the
window
carefully
perusing
a
pamphlet
written
to
illustrate
the
principle
nothing
be
lost
and
containing
many
sage
and
erudite
directions
for
the
composition
and
dimensions
of
that
ornament
to
a
gentleman
farmyard
and
a
cottager
front
door
ycleped
in
the
language
of
the
country
a
with
the
signification
of
which
we
would
not
for
the
world
shock
the
more
refined
feelings
of
our
southern
readers
many
were
the
inquiries
about
dear
lady
juliana
hoped
she
had
rested
well
hoped
the
found
the
bed
comfortable
etc
etc
these
inquiries
were
interrupted
by
the
laird
who
requested
is
son
to
take
a
turn
with
him
while
breakfast
was
getting
ready
that
they
might
talk
over
past
events
and
new
plans
that
he
might
see
the
new
planting
on
the
hill
the
draining
of
the
great
moss
with
other
agricultural
concerns
which
we
shall
omit
not
having
the
same
power
of
commanding
attention
for
our
readers
as
the
laird
had
from
his
hearers
after
repeated
summonses
and
many
inquiries
from
the
impatient
party
already
assembled
the
breakfast
table
lady
juliana
made
her
appearance
accompanied
by
her
favourites
whom
no
persuasions
of
her
husband
could
prevail
upon
her
to
leave
behind
as
she
entered
the
room
her
olfactory
nerves
were
smote
with
gales
not
of
araby
the
blest
but
of
old
cheese
and
herrings
with
which
the
hospitable
board
was
amply
provided
the
ladies
having
severally
exchanged
the
salutations
of
the
morning
miss
nicky
commenced
the
operation
of
pouring
out
tea
while
the
laird
laid
a
large
piece
of
herring
on
her
ladyship
plate
good
heavens
what
am
i
to
do
with
this
exclaimed
she
do
take
it
away
or
i
shall
faint
brother
brother
cried
miss
grizzy
in
a
tone
of
alarm
i
beg
you
wo
place
any
unpleasant
object
before
the
eyes
of
our
dear
niece
i
declare
pray
was
it
the
sight
or
the
smell
of
the
beast
that
shocked
you
so
much
my
dear
lady
juliana
i
sure
i
wish
to
goodness
lady
maclaughlan
was
come
in
scotland
everything
that
flies
and
swims
ranks
in
the
bestial
tribe
douglas
or
the
major
as
he
was
styled
immediately
rose
and
pulled
the
bell
desire
my
gig
to
be
got
ready
directly
said
he
the
aunts
drew
up
stiffly
and
looked
at
each
other
without
speaking
but
the
old
gentleman
expressed
his
surprise
that
his
son
should
think
of
leaving
them
so
soon
may
we
inquire
the
reason
of
this
sudden
resolution
at
length
said
miss
jacky
in
a
tone
of
stifled
indignation
certainly
if
you
are
disposed
to
hear
it
it
is
because
i
find
that
there
is
company
expected
the
three
ladies
turned
up
their
hands
and
eyes
in
speechless
horror
is
it
that
virtuous
woman
lady
maclaughlan
you
would
shun
nephew
demanded
miss
jacky
it
is
that
insufferable
woman
i
would
shun
replied
her
nephew
with
a
heightened
colour
and
a
violence
very
unusual
with
him
the
good
miss
grizzy
drew
out
her
while
douglas
vainly
endeavoured
to
silence
her
husband
and
avert
the
rising
storm
dear
douglas
whispered
his
wife
in
a
tone
of
reproach
oh
pray
let
him
go
on
said
miss
jacky
almost
choking
under
the
effort
she
made
to
appear
calm
let
him
go
on
lady
character
luckily
is
far
above
the
reach
of
calumny
nothing
that
archibald
douglas
can
say
will
have
power
to
change
our
opinions
or
i
hope
to
prejudice
his
brother
and
lady
juliana
against
this
most
exemplary
virtuous
woman
a
woman
of
family
of
fortune
of
talents
of
accomplishments
a
woman
of
unblemished
reputation
of
the
strictest
morals
sweetest
temper
charming
heart
delightful
spirits
so
charitable
every
year
gives
fifty
flannel
petticoats
to
the
old
people
of
the
parish
then
such
a
wife
as
she
is
sobbed
out
miss
grizzy
she
has
invented
i
do
know
how
many
different
medicines
for
sir
complaint
and
makes
a
point
of
his
taking
some
of
them
every
day
but
for
her
i
sure
he
would
have
been
in
his
grave
long
ago
she
doing
all
she
can
to
send
him
there
as
she
has
done
many
a
poor
wretch
already
with
her
infernal
compositions
here
miss
grizzy
sank
back
in
her
chair
overcome
with
horror
and
miss
nicky
let
fall
the
teapot
the
scalding
contents
of
which
discharged
themselves
upon
the
unfortunate
psyche
whose
yells
mingling
with
the
screams
of
its
fair
mistress
for
a
while
drowned
even
miss
oratory
oh
what
shall
i
do
cried
lady
juliana
as
she
bent
over
her
favourite
do
send
for
a
surgeon
pray
henry
fly
do
fetch
one
directly
or
she
will
die
and
it
would
quite
kill
me
to
lose
my
darling
do
run
dearest
harry
my
dear
julia
how
can
you
be
so
absurd
there
no
surgeon
within
twenty
miles
of
this
no
surgeon
within
twenty
miles
exclaimed
she
starting
up
how
could
you
bring
me
to
such
a
place
good
god
those
dear
creatures
may
die
i
may
die
myself
before
i
can
get
any
assistance
do
be
alarmed
my
dearest
niece
said
the
good
miss
grizzy
we
are
all
doctors
here
i
understand
something
of
physic
myself
and
our
friend
lady
maclaughlan
who
i
daresay
will
be
here
presently
is
perfect
mistress
of
every
disease
of
the
human
frame
clap
a
cauld
potatae
to
the
brute
tae
cried
the
old
laird
gruffly
i
a
box
of
her
scald
ointment
that
will
cure
it
in
a
minute
if
it
do
cure
it
will
kill
said
douglas
with
a
smile
brother
said
miss
jacky
rising
with
dignity
from
her
chair
and
waving
her
hand
as
she
brother
i
appeal
to
you
to
protect
the
character
of
this
most
amiable
respectable
matron
from
the
insults
and
calumny
your
son
thinks
proper
to
load
it
with
sir
sampson
maclaughlan
is
your
friend
and
it
therefore
becomes
your
duty
to
defend
his
wife
troth
but
i
hae
aneugh
to
do
if
i
am
to
stand
up
for
a
my
wives
said
the
old
gentleman
but
however
archie
you
are
to
blame
leddy
maclaughlan
is
a
very
decent
woman
at
least
as
far
as
i
ken
though
she
is
a
little
free
in
the
gab
and
out
of
respect
to
my
auld
friend
sir
sampson
it
is
my
desire
that
you
should
remain
here
to
receive
him
and
that
you
trait
baith
him
and
his
lady
discreetly
this
was
said
in
too
serious
a
tone
to
be
disputed
and
his
son
was
obliged
to
submit
the
ointment
meanwhile
having
been
applied
to
psyche
paw
peace
was
restored
and
breakfast
recommenced
i
declare
our
dear
niece
has
not
tasted
a
morsel
observed
miss
nicky
bless
me
here
charming
barley
meal
scones
cried
one
thrusting
a
plateful
of
them
before
her
here
tempting
pease
bannocks
interposed
another
and
oat
cakes
i
sure
your
ladyship
never
saw
such
cakes
i
ca
eat
any
of
those
things
said
their
delicate
niece
with
an
air
of
disgust
i
should
like
some
muffin
and
chocolate
you
forget
you
are
not
in
london
my
love
said
her
husband
reproachfully
no
indeed
i
do
not
forget
it
well
then
give
me
some
toast
with
an
air
of
languid
condescension
unfortunately
we
happen
be
quite
out
of
loaf
bread
at
present
said
miss
nicky
but
we
sent
to
drymsine
for
some
they
bake
excellent
bread
at
drymsine
is
there
nothing
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
you
would
fancy
julia
asked
douglas
do
think
love
i
think
i
should
like
some
grouse
or
a
beefsteak
if
it
was
very
nicely
done
returned
her
ladyship
in
a
languishing
tone
repeated
miss
grizzy
responded
miss
jacky
reverberated
miss
nicky
after
much
deliberation
and
consultation
amongst
the
three
spinsters
it
was
at
length
unanimously
carried
that
the
lady
whim
should
be
indulged
only
think
sisters
observed
miss
grizzy
in
an
undertone
what
reflections
we
should
have
to
make
upon
ourselves
if
the
child
was
to
resemble
a
moorfowl
or
have
a
face
like
a
raw
said
miss
nicky
these
arguments
were
unanswerable
and
a
smoking
steak
and
plump
were
quickly
produced
of
which
lady
juliana
partook
in
company
with
her
favourites

soaks

the
meal
being
at
length
concluded
glenfern
desired
henry
to
attend
him
on
a
walk
as
he
wished
to
have
a
little
more
private
conversation
with
him
lady
juliana
was
beginning
a
remonstrance
against
the
cruelty
of
taking
harry
away
from
her
when
her
husband
whispering
her
that
he
hoped
to
make
something
of
the
old
gentleman
and
that
he
should
soon
be
back
she
suffered
him
to
depart
in
silence
old
donald
having
at
length
succeeded
in
clearing
the
table
of
its
heterogeneous
banquet
it
was
quickly
covered
with
the
young
work
miss
nicky
withdrew
to
her
household
affairs
miss
jacky
sat
with
one
eye
upon
lady
juliana
the
other
upon
her
five
nieces
miss
grizzy
seated
herself
by
her
ladyship
holding
a
spread
letter
of
lady
maclaughlan
before
her
as
a
screen
while
the
young
ladies
busily
plied
their
needles
the
elder
ones
left
no
means
untried
to
entertain
their
listless
niece
whose
only
replies
were
exclamations
of
weariness
or
expressions
of
affection
bestowed
upon
her
favourites
at
length
even
miss
jacky
sense
and
miss
grizzy
good
nature
were
fault
when
a
ray
of
sunshine
darting
into
the
room
suggested
the
idea
of
a
walk
the
proposal
was
made
and
assented
to
by
her
ladyship
in
the
twofold
hope
of
meeting
her
husband
and
pleasing
her
dogs
whose
whining
and
scratching
had
for
some
time
testified
their
desire
of
a
change
the
ladies
therefore
separated
to
prepare
for
their
after
many
recommendations
from
the
aunts
to
be
sure
to
well
but
as
if
distrusting
her
powers
in
that
way
they
speedily
equipped
themselves
and
repaired
to
her
chamber
arrayed
a
in
the
walking
costume
of
glenfern
castle
and
indeed
it
must
be
owned
their
style
of
dress
was
infinitely
more
judicious
than
that
of
their
fashionable
niece
and
it
was
not
surprising
that
they
in
their
shrunk
duffle
greatcoats
vast
red
worsted
neckcloths
and
pattens
should
gaze
with
horror
at
her
lace
cap
lilac
satin
pelisse
and
silk
shoes
ruin
to
the
whole
race
of
glenfern
present
and
future
seemed
inevitable
from
such
a
display
of
extravagance
and
imprudence
having
surmounted
the
first
shock
miss
jacky
made
a
violent
effort
to
subdue
her
rising
wrath
and
with
a
sort
of
convulsive
smile
addressed
lady
juliana
your
ladyship
i
perceive
is
not
of
the
opinion
of
our
inimitable
bard
who
in
his
charming
poem
seasons
says
beauty
needs
not
the
foreign
aid
of
ornament
but
is
when
unadorned
adorned
the
most
that
is
a
truth
that
ought
to
be
impressed
on
every
young
woman
mind
wrap
lady
juliana
only
stared
she
was
as
little
accustomed
to
be
advised
as
she
was
to
hear
thomson
seasons
quoted
i
declare
that
all
quite
true
said
the
more
temporising
grizzy
and
certainly
our
girls
are
not
in
the
least
taken
up
about
their
dress
poor
things
which
is
a
great
comfort
at
the
same
time
i
sure
it
no
wonder
your
ladyship
should
be
taken
up
about
yours
for
certainly
that
pelisse
is
most
beautiful
nobody
can
deny
that
and
i
daresay
it
is
the
very
newest
fashion
at
the
same
time
i
just
afraid
that
it
rather
too
delicate
and
that
it
might
perhaps
get
a
little
dirty
on
our
roads
for
although
in
general
our
roads
are
quite
remarkable
for
being
always
dry
which
is
a
great
comfort
in
the
country
yet
you
know
the
very
best
roads
of
course
must
be
wet
sometimes
and
there
a
very
bad
step
just
at
the
door
almost
which
glenfern
has
been
always
speaking
about
getting
mended
but
to
be
sure
he
has
so
many
things
to
think
about
that
it
no
wonder
he
forgets
sometimes
but
i
daresay
he
will
get
it
done
very
soon
now
the
prospect
of
the
road
being
mended
produced
no
better
effect
than
the
quotation
from
thomson
seasons
it
was
now
miss
nicky
turn
i
afraid
your
ladyship
will
frighten
our
stirks
and
stots
with
your
finery
i
assure
you
they
are
not
accustomed
to
see
such
fine
figures
and
putting
her
hand
out
at
the
window
i
think
it
spitting
already
a
common
expression
in
scotland
to
signify
slight
rain
all
three
now
joined
in
the
chorus
beseeching
lady
juliana
to
put
on
something
warmer
and
more
wiselike
i
positively
have
nothing
cried
she
wearied
with
their
importunities
and
i
sha
get
any
winter
things
now
till
i
return
to
town
my
does
very
well
for
the
carriage
the
acknowledgment
at
the
beginning
of
this
speech
was
enough
all
three
instantly
disappeared
like
the
genii
of
aladin
lamp
and
like
that
same
person
presently
returned
loaded
with
what
in
their
eyes
were
precious
as
the
gold
of
arabia
one
displayed
a
hard
worsted
shawl
with
a
at
each
corner
another
held
up
a
tartan
cloak
with
a
hood
and
a
third
thrust
forward
a
dark
cloth
joseph
lined
with
flannel
while
one
and
all
showered
down
a
variety
of
old
bonnets
fur
tippets
hair
soles
clogs
pattens
and
endless
lady
juliana
shrank
with
disgust
from
these
delightful
haps
and
resisted
all
attempts
to
have
them
forced
upon
her
declaring
in
a
manner
which
showed
her
determined
to
have
her
own
way
that
she
would
either
go
out
as
she
was
or
not
go
out
at
all
the
aunts
were
therefore
obliged
to
submit
and
the
party
proceeded
to
what
was
termed
the
high
road
though
a
stranger
would
have
sought
in
vain
for
its
pretensions
to
that
title
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
that
was
far
enough
not
a
single
vehicle
could
be
descried
on
it
though
its
deep
ruts
showed
that
it
was
well
frequented
by
carts
the
scenery
might
have
had
charms
for
ossian
but
it
had
none
for
lady
juliana
who
would
rather
have
been
entangled
in
a
string
of
bond
street
equipages
than
traversing
the
lonely
heath
with
the
stream
murmuring
hoarsely
the
old
trees
groaning
in
the
wind
the
troubled
lake
and
the
still
more
troubled
sisters
as
may
be
supposed
she
very
soon
grew
weary
of
the
walk
the
bleak
wind
pierced
her
to
the
soul
her
silk
slippers
and
lace
flounces
became
undistinguishable
masses
of
mud
her
dogs
chased
the
sheep
and
were
in
their
turn
pursued
by
the
nowts
as
the
ladies
termed
the
steers
one
sister
expatiated
on
the
great
blessing
of
having
a
peat
moss
at
their
door
another
was
at
pains
to
point
out
the
purposed
site
of
a
set
of
new
offices
and
the
third
lamented
that
her
ladyship
had
not
on
thicker
shoes
that
she
might
have
gone
and
seen
the
garden
more
than
ever
disgusted
and
wretched
the
hapless
lady
juliana
returned
to
the
house
to
fret
away
the
time
till
her
husband
return

the
family
of
glenfern
have
already
said
so
much
for
themselves
that
it
seems
as
if
little
remained
to
be
told
by
their
biographer
douglas
was
the
only
member
of
the
community
who
was
at
all
conscious
of
the
unfortunate
association
of
characters
and
habits
that
had
just
taken
place
she
was
a
stranger
to
lady
juliana
but
she
was
interested
by
her
youth
beauty
and
elegance
and
felt
for
the
sacrifice
she
had
made
a
sacrifice
so
much
greater
than
it
was
possible
she
ever
could
have
conceived
or
anticipated
she
could
in
some
degree
enter
into
the
nature
of
her
feelings
towards
the
old
ladies
for
she
too
had
felt
how
disagreeable
people
might
contrive
to
render
themselves
without
being
guilty
of
any
particular
fault
and
how
much
more
difficult
it
is
to
bear
with
the
weaknesses
than
the
vices
of
our
neighbours
had
these
ladies
failings
been
greater
in
a
moral
point
of
view
it
might
not
have
been
so
arduous
a
task
to
put
up
with
them
but
to
love
such
a
set
of
little
trifling
tormenting
foibles
all
dignified
with
the
name
of
virtues
required
from
her
elegant
mind
an
exertion
of
its
highest
principles
a
continual
remembrance
of
that
difficult
christian
precept
to
bear
with
one
another
a
person
of
less
sense
than
douglas
would
have
endeavoured
to
open
the
eyes
of
their
understandings
on
what
appeared
to
be
the
folly
and
narrow
mindedness
of
their
ways
but
she
refrained
from
the
attempt
not
from
want
of
benevolent
exertion
but
from
an
innate
conviction
that
their
foibles
all
originated
in
what
was
now
incurable
viz
the
natural
weakness
of
their
minds
together
with
their
ignorance
of
the
world
and
the
illiberality
and
prejudices
of
a
vulgar
education
these
poor
women
reasoned
the
charitable
douglas
are
perhaps
after
all
better
characters
in
the
sight
of
god
than
i
am
he
who
has
endowed
us
all
as
his
wisdom
has
seen
fit
and
has
placed
me
amongst
them
oh
may
he
teach
me
to
remember
that
we
are
all
his
children
and
enable
me
to
bear
with
their
faults
while
i
study
to
correct
my
own
thus
did
this
amiable
woman
contrive
not
only
to
live
in
peace
but
without
sacrificing
her
own
liberal
ideas
to
be
actually
beloved
by
those
amongst
whom
her
lot
had
been
cast
however
dissimilar
to
herself
but
for
that
christian
spirit
in
which
must
ever
be
included
a
liberal
mind
and
gentle
temper
she
must
have
felt
towards
her
connexions
a
still
stronger
repugnance
than
was
even
manifested
by
lady
juliana
for
lady
juliana
superiority
over
them
was
merely
that
of
refined
habits
and
elegant
manners
whereas
douglas
was
the
superiority
of
a
noble
and
mind
which
could
hold
no
intercourse
with
theirs
except
by
stooping
to
the
level
of
their
low
capacities
but
that
the
merit
of
her
conduct
may
be
duly
appreciated
i
shall
endeavour
to
give
a
slight
sketch
of
the
female
of
glenfern
castle
miss
jacky
the
senior
of
the
trio
was
what
is
reckoned
a
very
sensible
woman
which
generally
means
a
very
disagreeable
obstinate
illiberal
director
of
all
men
women
and
children
a
sort
of
superintendent
of
all
actions
time
and
place
with
unquestioned
authority
to
arraign
judge
and
condemn
upon
the
statutes
of
her
own
supposed
sense
most
country
parishes
have
their
sensible
woman
who
lays
down
the
law
on
all
affairs
spiritual
and
temporal
miss
jacky
stood
unrivalled
as
the
sensible
woman
of
glenfern
she
had
attained
this
eminence
partly
from
having
a
little
more
understanding
than
her
sisters
but
principally
from
her
dictatorial
manner
and
the
pompous
decisive
tone
in
which
she
delivered
the
most
commonplace
truths
at
home
her
supremacy
in
all
matters
of
sense
was
perfectly
established
and
thence
the
infection
like
other
superstitions
had
spread
over
the
whole
neighbourhood
as
sensible
woman
she
regulated
the
family
which
she
took
care
to
let
everybody
see
she
was
conductor
of
her
nieces
education
which
she
took
care
to
let
everybody
hear
she
was
a
sort
of
postmistress
general
a
detector
of
all
abuses
and
impositions
and
deemed
it
her
prerogative
to
be
consulted
about
all
the
useful
and
useless
things
which
everybody
else
could
have
done
as
well
she
was
liberal
of
her
advice
to
the
poor
always
enforcing
upon
them
the
iniquity
of
idleness
but
doing
nothing
for
them
in
the
way
of
employment
strict
economy
being
one
of
the
many
points
in
which
she
was
particularly
sensible
the
consequence
was
while
she
was
lecturing
half
the
poor
women
in
the
parish
for
their
idleness
the
bread
was
kept
out
of
their
mouths
by
the
incessant
carding
of
wool
and
knitting
of
stockings
and
spinning
and
reeling
and
winding
and
pirning
that
went
on
amongst
the
ladies
themselves
and
miss
jacky
is
not
the
only
sensible
woman
who
thinks
she
is
acting
a
meritorious
part
when
she
converts
what
ought
to
be
the
portion
of
the
poor
into
the
employment
of
the
affluent
in
short
miss
jacky
was
all
over
sense
a
skilful
physiognomist
would
at
a
single
glance
have
detected
the
sensible
woman
in
the
erect
head
the
compressed
lips
square
elbows
and
firm
judicious
step
even
her
very
garments
seemed
to
partake
of
the
prevailing
character
of
their
mistress
her
ruff
always
looked
more
sensible
than
any
other
body
her
shawl
sat
most
sensibly
on
her
shoulders
her
walking
shoes
were
acknowledged
to
be
very
sensible
and
she
drew
on
her
gloves
with
an
air
of
sense
as
if
the
one
arm
had
been
seneca
the
other
socrates
from
what
has
been
said
it
may
easily
be
inferred
that
miss
jacky
was
in
fact
anything
but
a
sensible
woman
as
indeed
no
woman
can
be
who
bears
such
visible
outward
marks
of
what
is
in
reality
the
most
quiet
and
unostentatious
of
all
good
qualities
but
there
is
a
spurious
sense
which
passes
equally
well
with
the
multitude
it
is
easily
assumed
and
still
more
easily
maintained
common
truths
and
a
grave
dictatorial
air
being
all
that
is
necessary
for
its
support
miss
grizzy
character
will
not
admit
of
so
long
a
commentary
as
that
of
her
sister
she
was
merely
distinguishable
from
nothing
by
her
simple
good
nature
the
inextricable
entanglement
of
her
thoughts
her
love
of
and
her
friendship
with
lady
maclaughlan
miss
nicky
had
about
as
much
sense
as
miss
jacky
but
as
no
kingdom
can
maintain
two
kings
so
no
family
can
admit
of
two
sensible
women
and
nicky
was
therefore
obliged
to
confine
hers
to
the
narrowest
possible
channels
of
housekeeping
and
to
sit
down
for
life
or
at
least
till
miss
jacky
should
be
married
with
the
dubious
character
of
not
wanting
for
sense
either
with
all
these
little
peccadilloes
the
sisters
possessed
some
good
properties
they
were
and
upon
the
whole
they
loved
one
another
revered
their
brother
doated
upon
their
nephews
and
nieces
took
a
lively
interest
in
the
poorest
of
their
poor
cousins
a
hundred
degrees
removed
and
had
a
firm
conviction
of
the
perfectibility
of
human
nature
as
exemplified
in
the
persons
of
all
their
own
friends
even
their
failings
leaned
to
virtue
side
for
whatever
they
did
was
with
the
intention
of
doing
good
though
the
means
they
made
use
of
generally
produced
an
opposite
effect
but
there
are
so
many
miss
douglases
in
the
world
that
doubtless
everyone
of
my
readers
is
as
well
acquainted
with
them
as
i
am
myself
i
shall
therefore
leave
them
to
finish
the
picture
according
to
their
ideas
while
i
return
to
the
parlour
where
the
worthy
spinsters
are
seated
in
expectation
of
the
arrival
of
their
friend

ix
though
both
not
equal

their
sex
not

at

dejected
attitude

miss

up

miss

it
the

with

said
miss
nicky
it
lady
maclaughlan
i
assure
you
pronounced
miss
jacky
the
heavy
rumble
of
a
ponderous
vehicle
now
proclaimed
the
approach
of
the
expected
visitor
which
pleasing
anticipation
was
soon
changed
into
blissful
certainty
by
the
approach
of
a
square
bottomed
chariot
drawn
by
two
white
horses
and
followed
by
a
lackey
in
the
highland
garb
out
of
this
equipage
issued
a
figure
clothed
in
a
chintz
raiment
carefully
drawn
through
the
either
for
its
own
preservation
or
the
more
disinterested
purpose
of
displaying
a
dark
short
stuff
petticoat
which
with
the
same
liberality
afforded
ample
scope
for
the
survey
of
a
pair
of
worsted
stockings
and
black
leather
shoes
something
resembling
buckets
a
faded
red
cloth
jacket
which
bore
evident
marks
of
having
been
severed
from
its
native
skirts
now
acted
in
the
capacity
of
a
spencer
on
the
head
rose
a
stupendous
fabric
in
the
form
of
a
cap
on
the
summit
of
which
was
placed
a
black
beaver
hat
tied
la
a
small
black
satin
muff
in
one
hand
and
a
in
the
other
completed
the
dress
and
decoration
of
this
personage
the
lackey
meanwhile
advanced
to
the
carriage
and
putting
in
both
his
hands
as
if
to
catch
so
something
he
pulled
forth
a
small
bundle
enveloped
in
a
military
cloak
the
contents
of
which
would
have
baffled
conjecture
but
for
the
large
cocked
hat
and
little
booted
leg
which
protruded
at
opposite
extremities
a
loud
but
slow
and
voice
now
resounded
through
the
narrow
stone
passage
that
conducted
to
the
bring
him
in
bring
him
in
philistine
i
always
call
my
man
philistine
because
he
has
sampson
in
his
hands
set
him
down
there
pointing
to
an
easy
chair
as
the
group
now
entered
headed
by
lady
maclaughlan
well
girls
addressing
the
venerable
spinsters
as
they
severally
exchanged
a
tender
salute
so
you

alive
i
see
humph

lady
maclaughlan
allow
me
to
introduce

beloved
niece

leading
her
up
and
bridling
as
she
spoke
with
exultation
so
you
very
pretty
yes
you
are
very
pretty
kissing
the
forehead
cheeks
and
chin
of
the
youthful
beauty
between
every
pause
then
holding
her
at
arm
length
she
surveyed
her
from
head
to
foot
with
elevated
brows
and
a
broad
fixed
stare
pray
sit
down
lady
maclaughlan
cried
her
three
friends
all
at
once
each
tendering
a
chair

down
repeated
she
why
what
should

sit
down
for

turning
to
the
little
warrior
who
having
been
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
on
his
entrance
had
now
sunk
back
seemingly
quite
exhausted
while
the
was
endeavouring
to
disencumber
him
of
his
military
accoutrements
how
very
distressing

cough
is

distressing

to
stop
it
replied
the
accommodating
spinster
no
it
would
be
the
least
pity
to
stop
it
returned
lady
maclaughlan
in
her
loud
authoritative
tone
because
though
it
not
distressing
it
very
disagreeable
but
it
can
not
be
stopped
you
might
as
well
talk
of
stopping
the
wind
it
is
a
cradle
cough
my
dear
lady
maclaughlan
screamed
sir
sampson
in
a
shrill
pipe
as
he
made
an
effort
to
raise
himself
and
rescue
his
cough
from
this
aspersion
how
can
you
persist
in
saying
so
when
i
have
told
you
so
often
it
proceeds
entirely
from
a
cold
caught
a
few
years
ago
when
i
attended
his
majesty
at
here
a
violent
relapse
carried
the
conclusion
of
the
sentence
along
with
it
let
him
meddle
with
him
called
his
lady
to
the
assiduous
nymphs
who
were
bustling
around
him
leave
him
to
philistine
he
in
very
good
hands
when
he
is
in
philistine
then
resting
her
chin
upon
the
head
of
her
stick
she
resumed
her
scrutiny
of
lady
juliana
you
really
are
a
pretty
creature
you
got
a
very
handsome
nose
and
your
mouth
very
well
but
i
do
like
your
eyes
they
too
large
and
too
light
they
saucer
eyes
and
i
do
like
saucer
eyes
why
you
black
eyes
you
not
a
bit
like
your
father
i
knew
him
very
well
your
mother
was
an
heiress
your
father
married
her
for
her
money
and
she
married
him
to
be
a
countess
and
so
that
the
history
of
their
this
harangue
was
delivered
in
an
unvarying
tone
and
with
unmoved
muscles
for
though
the
lady
seldom
failed
of
calling
forth
some
conspicuous
emotion
either
of
shame
mirth
or
anger
on
the
countenances
of
her
hearers
she
had
never
been
known
to
betray
any
correspondent
feelings
on
her
own
yet
her
features
were
finely
formed
marked
and
expressive
and
in
spite
of
her
ridiculous
dress
and
eccentric
manners
an
air
of
dignity
was
diffused
over
her
whole
person
that
screened
her
from
the
ridicule
to
which
she
must
otherwise
have
been
exposed
amazement
at
the
uncouth
garb
and
singular
address
of
lady
maclaughlan
was
seldom
unmixed
with
terror
at
the
stern
imperious
manner
that
accompanied
all
her
actions
such
were
the
feelings
of
lady
juliana
as
she
remained
subjected
to
her
rude
gaze
and
impertinent
remarks
my
lady
squeaked
sir
sampson
from
forth
his
easy
chair
my
love
interrogated
his
lady
as
she
leant
upon
her
stick
i
want
to
be
introduced
to
my
lady
juliana
douglas
so
give
me
your
hand
attempting
at
the
same
time
to
emerge
from
the
huge
leathern
receptacle
into
which
he
had
been
plunged
by
the
care
of
the
kind
sisters
oh
pray
sit
still
dear
sir
sampson
cried
they
as
usual
all
at
once
our
sweet
niece
will
come
to
you
do
take
the
trouble
to
rise
pray
do
each
putting
a
hand
on
this
man
of
might
as
he
was
half
risen
and
pushing
him
down
ay
come
here
my
dear
said
lady
maclaughlan
you
abler
to
walk
to
sir
sampson
than
he
to
you
pulling
lady
juliana
in
front
of
the
easy
chair
there
that
her
you
see
she
is
very
pretty
zounds
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
screamed
the
enraged
baronet
my
lady
juliana
douglas
i
am
shocked
beyond
expression
at
this
freedom
of
my
lady
i
beg
your
ladyship
ten
thousand
pardons
pray
be
seated
i
shocked
i
am
ready
to
faint
at
the
impropriety
of
this
introduction
so
contrary
to
all
rules
of
etiquette
how
behave
in
such
a
manner
my
lady
maclaughlan
why
you
know
my
dear
your
legs
may
be
very
good
legs
but
they
walk
replied
she
with
her
usual
my
lady
maclaughlan
you
perfectly
confound
me
stuttering
with
rage
my
lady
juliana
douglas
see
here
stretching
out
a
meagre
shank
to
which
not
even
the
military
boot
and
large
spur
could
give
a
respectable
appearance
you
see
that
leg
strong
and
straight
stroking
it
down
now
behold
the
fate
of
war
dragging
forward
the
other
which
was
shrunk
and
shrivelled
to
almost
one
half
its
original
dimensions
these
legs
were
once
the
same
but
i
repine
not
i
sacrificed
it
in
a
noble
cause
to
that
leg
my
sovereign
owes
his
life
well
i
declare
i
had
no
idea
i
thought
always
it
had
been
rheumatism
burst
from
the
lips
of
the
astonished
spinsters
as
they
crowded
round
the
illustrious
limb
and
regarded
it
with
looks
of
veneration
humph
emphatically
uttered
his
lady
the
story
a
simple
one
ladies
and
soon
told
i
happened
to
be
attending
his
majesty
at
a
review
i
was
then
to
lord
his
horse
took
fright
i
i
i
here
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
that
could
be
made
to
suppress
it
the
forth
with
a
violence
that
threatened
to
silence
its
brave
owner
for
ever
it
very
strange
you
will
talk
my
love
said
his
sympathising
lady
as
she
supported
him
talking
never
did
nor
never
will
agree
with
you
it
very
strange
what
pleasure
people
take
in
talking
humph
is
there
anything
dear
sir
sampson
could
take
asked
miss
grizzy
take
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
take
he
take
the
moon
if
you
meant
hat
but
he
must
take
what
i
give
him
so
call
philistine
he
knows
where
my
cough
tincture
is
oh
we
have
plenty
of
it
in
this
press
said
miss
grizzy
flying
to
a
cupboard
and
drawing
forth
a
bottle
she
poured
out
a
bumper
and
presented
it
to
sir
sampson
i
poisoned
gasped
he
feebly
that
not
my
lady
not
repeated
the
doctress
as
for
the
first
time
she
examined
the
label
oh
i
declare
neither
it
is
my
own
stomach
lotion
bless
me
what
will
be
done
and
she
wrung
her
hands
in
despair
oh
murdoch
flying
to
the
as
he
entered
with
the
real
i
given
sir
sampson
a
dose
of
my
own
stomach
lotion
by
mistake
and
i
am
terrified
for
the
consequences
oo
but

na
be
feared
hur

feesick
that
the
leddie
ordered
hur

well
i
declare
things

wisely
ordered
observed
miss
grizzy
in
that
case
it
may
do
dear
sir
sampson
a
great
deal
of
good
just
as
this
pleasing
idea
was
suggested
douglas
and
his
father
entered
and
the
ceremony
of
presenting
her
nephew
to
her
friend
was
performed
by
miss
grizzy
in
her
most
conciliating
manner
dear
lady
maclaughlan
this
is
our
nephew
henry
who
i
know
has
the
highest
veneration
for
sir
sampson
and
you
henry
i
assure
you
lady
maclaughlan
takes
the
greatest
interest
in
everything
that
concerns
lady
juliana
and
you
humph
rejoined
her
ladyship
as
she
surveyed
him
from
head
to
foot
so
your
wife
fell
in
love
with
you
it
seems
well
the
more
fool
she
i
never
knew
any
good
come
of
love
marriages
douglas
coloured
while
he
affected
to
laugh
at
this
extraordinary
address
and
withdrawing
himself
from
her
scrutiny
resumed
his
station
by
the
side
of
his
juliana
now
girls
i
must
go
to
my
toilet
which
of
you
am
i
to
have
for
my
handmaid
oh
we
all
go
eagerly
exclaimed
the
three
nymphs
our
dear
niece
will
excuse
us
for
a
little
young
people
are
never
at
a
loss
to
amuse
one
another
venus
and
the
graces
by
jove
exclaimed
sir
sampson
bowing
with
an
air
of
gallantry
and
now
i
must
go
and
adonise
a
little
myself
the
company
then
separated
to
perform
the
important
offices
of
the
toilet
chapter
x
nature
here
wanton
as
in
her
prime
and
played
at
will
her
virgin
fancies
milton
the
gentlemen
were
already
assembled
round
the
fire
impatiently
waiting
the
hour
of
dinner
when
lady
maclaughlan
and
her
three
friends
entered
the
masculine
habiliments
of
the
morning
had
been
exchanged
for
a
more
feminine
costume
she
was
now
arrayed
in
a
pompadour
satin
and
petticoat
trimmed
with
brussels
lace
a
high
starched
handkerchief
formed
a
complete
breast
work
on
which
amid
a
large
bouquet
of
truly
artificial
roses
reposed
a
miniature
of
sir
sampson
la
a
small
fly
cap
of
antique
lace
was
scarcely
perceptible
on
the
summit
of
a
stupendous
frizzled
toupee
hemmed
in
on
each
side
by
large
curls
the
muff
and
stick
had
been
relinquished
for
a
large
fan
something
resembling
an
indian
screen
which
she
waved
to
and
fro
in
one
hand
while
a
vast
brocaded
workbag
was
suspended
from
the
other
so
major
douglas
your
servant
said
she
in
answer
to
the
constrained
formal
bow
with
which
he
saluted
her
on
her
entrance
why
it
so
long
since
i
seen
you
that
you
may
be
a
grandfather
for
ought
i
know
the
poor
awkward
misses
at
that
moment
came
sneaking
into
the
room
as
for
you
girls
you
never
be
grandmothers
you
never
be
married
unless
to
wild
men
of
the
woods
i
suppose
you
like
that
it
would
save
you
the
trouble
of
combing
your
hair
and
tying
your
shoes
for
then
you
could
go
without
clothes
altogether
humph
you
be
much
better
without
clothes
than
to
put
them
on
as
you
do
seizing
upon
the
luckless
miss
baby
as
she
endeavoured
to
steal
behind
backs
and
here
in
justice
to
the
lady
it
must
be
owned
that
for
once
she
had
some
grounds
for
animadversion
in
the
dress
and
appearance
of
the
misses
douglas
they
had
stayed
out
running
races
and
riding
on
a
pony
until
near
the
dinner
hour
and
dreading
their
father
displeasure
should
they
be
too
late
they
had
with
the
utmost
haste
exchanged
their
thick
morning
dresses
for
thin
muslin
gowns
made
by
a
of
the
neighbourhood
in
the
extreme
of
a
fashion
when
waists
but
as
dame
nature
had
been
particularly
lavish
in
the
length
of
theirs
and
the
had
according
to
their
aunt
direction
given
them
of
their
new
dark
stays
there
existed
a
visible
breach
between
the
waists
of
their
gowns
and
the
bands
of
their
petticoats
which
they
had
vainly
sought
to
adjust
by
a
meeting
their
hair
had
been
curled
but
not
combed
and
dark
gloves
had
been
hastily
drawn
on
to
hide
red
arms
i
suppose
continued
the
stern
lady
maclaughlan
as
she
twirled
her
victim
round
and
round
i
suppose
you
think
yourself
vastly
smart
and
well
dressed
yes
you
are
very
neat
very
neat
indeed
one
would
suppose
ben
jonson
had
you
in
his
eye
when
he
composed
that
song
then
in
a
voice
like
thunder
she
chanted
forth
give
me
a
look
give
me
a
face
that
makes
simplicity
a
grace
robes
loosely
flowing
hair
as
free
such
sweet
neglect
more
taketh
me
miss
grizzy
was
in
the
utmost
perplexity
between
her
inclination
to
urge
something
in
extenuation
for
the
poor
girls
and
her
fear
of
dissenting
from
lady
maclaughlan
or
rather
of
not
immediately
agreeing
with
her
she
therefore
steered
as
usual
the
middle
course
and
kept
saying
well
children
really
what
lady
maclaughlan
says
is
all
very
true
at
the
same
time
turning
to
her
friend
i
declare
it
not
much
to
be
wondered
at
young
people
are
so
thoughtless
poor
lambs
what
aw
this
wark
aboo
said
the
old
gentleman
angrily
the
girlies
are
weel
eneugh
i
see
naething
the
matter
wi
them
they
no
dresse
like
auld
queens
or
and
he
glance
his
eye
from
lady
maclaughlan
to
his
elegant
who
just
then
entered
hanging
according
to
custom
on
her
husband
and
preceded
by
cupid
mrs
douglas
followed
and
the
sound
of
the
dinner
bell
put
a
stop
to
the
dispute
come
my
leddie
we
see
how
the
dinner
dressed
said
the
laird
as
he
seized
lady
maclaughlan
by
the
tip
of
the
finger
and
holding
it
up
aloft
they
marched
into
the
dining
room
permit
me
my
lady
juliana
douglas
said
the
little
baronet
with
much
difficulty
hobbling
towards
her
and
attempting
to
take
her
hand
come
harry
love
here
cupid
cried
she
and
without
noticing
the
enraged
sir
sampson
she
passed
on
humming
a
tune
and
leaning
upon
her
husband
astonishing
perfectly
astonishing
exclaimed
the
baronet
how
a
young
woman
of
lady
juliana
rank
and
fashion
should
be
guilty
of
such
a
solecism
in
good
breeding
she
is
very
young
said
douglas
smiling
as
he
limped
along
with
her
and
you
must
make
allowances
for
her
but
indeed
i
think
her
beauty
must
ever
be
a
sufficient
excuse
for
any
little
errors
she
may
commit
with
a
person
of
such
taste
and
gallantry
as
sir
sampson
maclaughlan
the
little
baronet
smiled
pressed
the
hand
he
held
and
soothed
by
the
compliment
he
seated
himself
next
to
lady
juliana
with
some
complacency
as
she
insisted
on
having
her
husband
on
the
other
side
of
her
douglas
was
condemned
to
take
his
station
by
the
hated
lady
maclaughlan
who
for
the
first
time
observing
douglas
called
to
her
come
here
my
love
i
have
seen
you
these
hundred
years
then
seizing
her
face
between
her
hands
she
saluted
her
in
the
usual
style
there
at
length
releasing
mrs
douglas
from
her
gripe
there
for
you
i
love
you
very
much
you
neither
a
fool
nor
a
hoyden
you
a
fine
intelligent
being
having
carefully
rolled
up
and
deposited
her
gloves
in
her
pocket
she
pulled
out
a
and
calling
miss
bella
desired
her
to
pin
her
napkin
over
her
shoulders
which
done
she
began
to
devour
her
soup
in
silence
peace
was
however
of
short
duration
old
donald
in
removing
a
dish
of
whipt
cream
unfortunately
overturned
one
upon
lady
pompadour
satin
petticoat
the
only
part
of
her
dress
that
was
unprotected
do
you
see
what
you
have
done
you
old
donald
you
cried
she
seizing
the
culprit
by
the
sleeve
why
you
got
vitus
dance
a
fit
hand
to
carry
whipt
cream
to
be
sure
why
i
could
as
well
carry
a
custard
on
the
point
of
a
bayonet
humph
dear
me
donald
how
could
you
be
so
senseless
cried
miss
jacky
preserve
me
donald
i
thought
you
had
more
sense
squeaked
miss
nicky
i
am
sure
donald
that
was
na
like
you
said
miss
grizzy
as
the
friends
all
flocked
around
the
petticoat
each
suggesting
a
different
remedy
it
all
of
you
girls
that
his
has
happened
why
ca
you
have
a
larger
tablecloth
upon
your
table
and
that
old
man
has
the
palsy
why
do
you
electrify
him
in
a
tone
admirably
calculated
to
have
that
effect
i
declare
it
all
very
true
observed
miss
grizzy
the
tablecloth
very
small
and
donald
certainly
shake
that
can
not
be
denied
but
lowering
her
voice
he
is
so
obstinate
we
really
know
what
to
do
with
him
my
sisters
and
i
attempted
to
use
the
with
him
oh
and
an
excellent
thing
it
is
i
make
philistine
rub
sir
sampson
every
morning
and
night
if
it
was
not
for
that
and
his
cough
nobody
would
know
whether
he
were
dead
or
alive
i
do
believe
he
would
know
himself
humph
sir
sampson
lemon
face
assumed
an
orange
hue
as
he
overheard
this
domestic
detail
but
not
daring
to
contradict
the
facts
he
prudently
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
them
and
attempted
to
carryon
a
flirtation
with
lady
juliana
through
the
medium
of
cupid
whom
he
had
coaxed
upon
his
knee
dinner
being
at
length
ended
toasts
succeeded
and
each
of
the
ladies
having
given
her
favourite
laird
the
signal
of
retreat
was
given
and
a
general
movement
took
place
lady
juliana
throwing
herself
upon
a
sofa
with
her
pugs
called
douglas
to
her
do
sit
down
here
and
talk
with
me
yawned
she
her
with
great
fetched
her
work
and
seated
herself
by
the
spoilt
child
what
strange
thing
is
that
you
are
making
asked
she
as
douglas
pulled
out
her
knitting
it
a
child
stocking
replied
her
a
child
stocking
oh
have
you
a
great
many
children
i
have
none
answered
douglas
with
a
sigh
none
at
all
repeated
lady
juliana
with
surprise
then
why
do
you
make
children
stockings
i
make
them
for
those
whose
parents
can
not
afford
to
purchase
them
la
what
poor
wretches
they
must
be
that
ca
afford
to
buy
stockings
rejoined
lady
juliana
with
a
yawn
it
monstrous
good
of
you
to
make
them
to
be
sure
but
it
must
be
a
shocking
bore
and
such
a
trouble
and
another
long
yawn
succeeded
not
half
such
a
bore
to
me
as
to
sit
idle
returned
douglas
with
a
smile
nor
near
so
much
trouble
as
you
undergo
with
your
favourites
lady
juliana
made
no
reply
but
turning
from
her
soon
was
or
affected
to
be
sound
a
sleep
from
which
she
was
only
roused
by
the
entrance
of
the
gentlemen
a
rubber
or
a
reel
my
leddie
asked
the
laird
going
up
to
his
julia
love
said
her
husband
my
father
asks
you
if
you
choose
cards
or
dancing
there
nobody
to
dance
with
said
she
casting
a
languid
glance
around
i
play
at
cards
not
whist
surely
said
henry
whist
oh
heavens
no
weel
weel
you
youngsters
will
get
a
roundgame
come
my
leddy
maclaughlan
grizzy
douglas
hey
for
the
odd
trick
and
the
honours
what
would
your
ladyship
choose
to
play
at
asked
miss
jacky
advancing
with
a
pack
of
cards
in
one
hand
and
a
box
of
counters
in
the
other
oh
anything
i
like
very
well
or
quadrille
or
really
care
what
the
misses
who
had
gathered
round
and
were
standing
gaping
in
joyful
expectation
of
pope
joan
or
a
pool
at
commerce
here
exchanged
sorrowful
glances
i
am
afraid
the
young
people
do
play
these
games
replied
miss
jacky
but
we
counters
enough
shaking
her
little
box
for
pope
joan
and
we
all
know
that
pope
joan
i
never
heard
of
such
a
game
replied
lady
juliana
oh
we
can
soon
learn
you
said
miss
nicky
who
having
spread
the
green
cloth
on
the
now
advanced
to
join
the
consultation
i
hate
to
be
taught
said
lady
juliana
with
a
yawn
besides
i
am
sure
it
must
be
something
very
stupid
ask
if
she
plays
commerce
whispered
miss
bella
to
miss
baby
the
question
was
put
but
with
no
better
success
and
the
young
faces
again
bespoke
their
disappointment
which
their
brother
observing
he
declared
his
perfect
knowledge
of
commerce
and
i
must
insist
upon
teaching
you
juliana
gently
dragging
her
to
the
table
what
the
pool
to
be
asked
one
of
the
young
ladies
i
sure
i
do
know
said
the
aunts
looking
to
each
other
i
suppose
we
must
make
it
sixpence
said
miss
jacky
after
a
whispering
consultation
with
her
sister
in
that
case
we
can
afford
nothing
to
the
best
hand
observed
miss
nicky
and
we
ought
to
have
five
lives
and
grace
added
one
of
the
nieces
these
points
having
been
conceded
the
preliminaries
were
at
length
settled
the
cards
were
slowly
out
by
miss
jacky
and
lady
juliana
was
carefully
instructed
in
the
rules
of
the
game
and
strongly
recommended
always
to
try
for
a
sequence
or
pairs
etc
and
if
you
win
rejoined
miss
nicky
shaking
the
in
which
were
deposited
the
sixpences
you
get
all
this
as
may
be
conjectured
lady
juliana
patience
could
not
survive
more
than
one
life
she
had
no
notion
of
playing
for
sixpences
and
could
not
be
at
the
trouble
to
attend
to
any
instructions
she
therefore
quickly
retired
in
disgust
leaving
the
aunts
and
nieces
to
struggle
for
the
glorious
prize
my
dear
child
you
played
that
last
stroke
like
a
perfect
natural
cried
lady
maclaughlan
to
miss
grizzy
as
the
rubber
ended
they
arose
from
the
table
indeed
i
declare
i
daresay
i
did
replied
her
friend
in
a
deprecating
tone
daresay
you
did
i
know
you
i
knew
the
ace
lay
with
you
i
knew
that
as
well
as
if
i
had
seen
it
i
suppose
you
have
eyes
but
i
do
know
if
you
have
did
you
see
glenfern
turn
up
the
king
and
yet
you
returned
his
lead
returned
our
adversary
lead
in
the
face
of
his
king
i
been
telling
you
these
twenty
years
not
to
return
your
adversary
lead
nothing
can
be
more
despicable
nothing
can
be
a
greater
proof
of
imbecility
of
mind
humph
then
seating
herself
she
began
to
exercise
her
fan
with
considerable
activity
this
has
been
the
most
disagreeable
day
i
ever
spent
in
this
house
girls
i
do
know
what
come
over
you
but
you
are
all
wrong
my
petticoat
ruined
my
pockets
picked
at
cards
it
wo
do
girls
it
wo
do
humph
i
am
sure
i
ca
understand
it
said
miss
grizzy
in
a
rueful
accent
there
really
appears
to
have
been
some
fatality
fatality
humph
i
wish
you
would
give
everything
its
right
name
what
do
you
mean
by
fatality
i
declare
i
am
sure
i
i
really
do
know
stammered
the
unfortunate
grizzy
do
you
mean
that
the
spilling
of
the
custard
was
the
work
of
an
angel
demanded
her
unrelenting
friend
oh
certainly
not
or
that
it
was
the
devil
tempted
you
to
throw
away
your
ace
there
i
suppose
there
a
fatality
in
our
going
to
supper
just
now
continued
she
as
her
voice
resounded
through
the
passage
that
conducted
to
the
and
i
suppose
it
will
be
called
a
fatality
if
that
old
fate
pointing
to
donald
scalds
me
to
death
with
that
mess
of
porridge
he
going
to
put
on
the
table
humph
no
such
fatality
however
occurred
and
the
rest
of
the
evening
passed
off
in
as
much
harmony
as
could
be
expected
from
the
very
heterogeneous
parts
of
which
the
society
was
formed
the
family
group
had
already
assembled
round
the
with
the
exception
of
lady
juliana
who
chose
to
take
that
meal
in
bed
but
contrary
to
her
usual
custom
no
lady
maclaughlan
had
yet
made
her
appearance
the
scones
will
be
like
leather
said
miss
grizzy
as
she
wrapped
another
napkin
round
them
the
eggs
will
be
like
snowballs
cried
miss
jacky
popping
them
into
the
the
tea
will
be
like
brandy
observed
miss
nicky
as
she
poured
more
water
to
the
three
teaspoonfuls
she
had
infused
i
wish
we
saw
our
breakfast
said
the
laird
as
he
finished
the
newspapers
and
deposited
his
spectacles
in
his
pocket
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
the
person
in
question
entered
in
her
travelling
dress
followed
by
sir
sampson
philistine
bringing
up
the
rear
with
a
large
green
bag
and
a
little
i
hope
your
bed
was
warm
and
comfortable
i
hope
you
rested
well
i
hope
sir
sampson
quite
well
immediately
burst
as
if
from
a
thousand
voices
while
the
sisters
officiously
fluttered
round
their
friend
i
rested
very
ill
my
bed
was
very
uncomfortable
and
sir
sampson
as
sick
as
a
cat
humph
three
disconsolate
bless
me
here
burst
forth
perhaps
your
bed
was
too
hard
said
miss
grizzy
or
too
soft
suggested
miss
jacky
or
too
hot
added
miss
nicky
it
was
neither
too
hard
nor
too
soft
nor
too
hot
nor
too
cold
thundered
the
lady
as
she
seated
herself
at
the
table
but
it
was
all
of
them
i
declare
that
most
distressing
said
miss
grizzy
in
a
tone
of
sorrowful
amazement
was
your
head
high
enough
dear
lady
maclaughlan
perhaps
it
was
too
high
said
miss
jacky
i
know
nothing
more
disagreeable
than
a
high
head
remarked
miss
nicky
except
a
fool
head
humph
the
sound
of
a
carriage
here
set
all
ears
on
full
stretch
and
presently
the
drew
up
dear
me
bless
me
goodness
me
shrieked
the
three
ladies
at
once
surely
lady
maclaughlan
you
ca
you
do
you
wo
this
must
be
a
mistake
there
no
mistake
in
the
matter
girls
replied
their
friend
with
her
accustomed
i
going
home
so
i
ordered
the
carriage
that
all
humph
going
home
faintly
murmured
the
disconsolate
spinsters
what
i
suppose
you
think
i
ought
to
stay
here
and
have
another
petticoat
spoiled
or
lose
another
at
cards
or
have
the
finishing
stroke
put
to
sir
sampson
humph
oh
lady
maclaughlan
was
three
times
uttered
in
reproachful
accents
i
do
know
what
else
i
should
stay
for
you
are
not
yourselves
girls
you
all
turned
i
visited
here
these
twenty
years
and
i
never
saw
things
in
the
state
they
are
now
humph
i
declare
it
very
true
sighed
miss
grizzy
we
certainly
are
a
little
in
confusion
that
ca
be
denied
denied
why
can
you
deny
that
my
petticoat
ruined
can
you
deny
that
my
pocket
was
picked
of
for
nothing
can
you
deny
that
sir
sampson
has
been
and
my
lady
maclaughlan
interrupted
the
enraged
husband
i
i
i
am
surprised
i
am
shocked
zounds
my
lady
i
wo
suffer
this
i
can
not
stand
it
and
pushing
his
away
he
arose
and
limped
to
the
window
philistine
here
entered
to
inform
his
mistress
that
awthing
was
ready
steady
boys
steady
i
always
am
ready
responded
the
lady
in
a
tone
adapted
to
the
song
now
i
am
ready
say
nothing
girls
you
know
my
rules
here
philistine
wrap
up
sir
sampson
and
put
him
in
get
along
my
love
girls
and
i
hope
you
will
all
be
restored
to
your
right
senses
soon
oh
lady
maclaughlan
whined
the
weeping
grizzy
as
she
embraced
her
friend
who
somewhat
melted
at
the
signs
of
her
distress
bawled
out
from
the
carriage
as
the
door
was
shut
well
god
bless
you
girls
and
make
you
what
you
have
been
and
come
to
lochmarlie
castle
soon
and
bring
your
wits
along
with
you
the
carriage
then
drove
off
and
the
three
disconsolate
sisters
returned
to
the
parlour
to
hold
a
cabinet
council
as
to
the
causes
of
the
late
disasters
chapter
xi
if
there
be
cure
or
charm
to
respite
or
relieve
or
slack
the
pain
of
this
ill
mansion
milton
time
which
generally
alleviates
ordinary
distresses
served
only
to
augment
the
severity
of
lady
juliana
as
day
after
day
rolled
heavily
on
and
found
her
still
an
inmate
of
glenfern
castle
destitute
of
very
resource
in
herself
she
yet
turned
with
contempt
from
the
scanty
sources
of
occupation
or
amusement
that
were
suggested
by
others
and
douglas
attempts
to
teach
her
to
play
at
chess
and
read
shakespeare
were
as
unsuccessful
as
the
endeavours
of
the
good
aunts
to
persuade
her
to
study
fordyce
sermons
and
make
baby
linen
in
languid
dejection
or
fretful
repinings
did
the
unhappy
beauty
therefore
consume
the
tedious
hours
while
her
husband
sought
alternately
to
soothe
with
fondness
he
no
longer
felt
or
flatter
with
hopes
which
he
knew
to
be
groundless
to
his
father
alone
could
he
now
look
for
any
assistance
and
from
him
he
was
not
likely
to
obtain
it
in
the
form
he
desired
as
the
old
gentleman
repeatedly
declared
his
utter
inability
to
advance
him
any
ready
money
or
to
allow
him
more
than
a
hundred
a
year
moreover
to
be
paid
quarterly
a
sum
which
could
not
defray
their
expenses
to
london
such
was
the
state
of
affairs
when
the
laird
one
morning
entered
the
with
a
face
of
much
importance
and
addressed
his
son
with
weel
harry
you
a
lucky
man
and
it
an
ill
wind
that
blaws
naebody
gude
here
puir
macglashan
gane
like
snaw
aff
a
dyke
macglashan
gone
exclaimed
miss
grizzy
impossible
brother
it
was
only
yesterday
i
sent
him
a
blister
for
his
back
and
i
said
miss
jacky
talked
to
him
for
upwards
of
two
hours
last
night
on
the
impropriety
of
his
allowing
his
daughter
to
wear
white
gowns
on
sunday
by
my
troth
an
that
was
eneugh
to
kill
ony
man
muttered
the
laird
how
i
am
to
derive
any
benefit
from
this
important
demise
is
more
than
i
can
perceive
said
henry
in
a
somewhat
contemptuous
tone
you
see
replied
his
father
that
by
our
agreement
his
farm
falls
vacant
in
consequence
and
i
hope
i
am
to
succeed
to
it
replied
the
son
with
a
smile
of
derision
exactly
by
my
faith
but
you
have
a
be
in
downset
there
three
thousand
and
acres
of
as
good
sheep
walk
as
any
in
the
whole
and
i
shall
advance
you
stocking
and
stedding
and
everything
complete
to
your
very
peatstacks
what
think
ye
of
that
slapping
his
son
shoulder
and
rubbing
his
own
hands
with
delight
as
he
spoke
horrorstruck
at
a
scheme
which
appeared
to
him
a
thousand
times
worse
than
anything
his
imagination
had
ever
painted
poor
henry
stood
in
speechless
consternation
while
charming
excellent
delightful
was
echoed
by
the
aunts
as
they
crowded
round
wishing
him
joy
and
applauding
their
brother
generosity
what
will
our
sweet
niece
say
to
this
i
wonder
said
the
innocent
grizzy
who
in
truth
wondered
none
i
would
like
to
see
her
face
when
she
hears
it
and
her
own
was
puckered
into
various
shapes
of
delight
i
have
no
doubt
but
her
good
sense
will
teach
her
to
appreciate
properly
the
blessings
of
her
lot
observed
the
more
reflecting
jacky
she
has
had
her
own
good
luck
quoth
the
sententious
nicky
to
find
such
a
down
set
all
cut
and
dry
at
that
instant
the
door
opened
and
the
favoured
individual
in
question
entered
in
vain
douglas
strove
to
impose
silence
on
his
father
and
aunts
the
latter
sat
bursting
with
impatience
to
break
out
into
exclamation
while
the
former
advancing
to
his
fair
saluted
her
as
lady
clackandow
then
the
torrent
burst
forth
and
stupefied
with
surprise
lady
juliana
suffered
herself
to
be
kissed
and
hugged
by
the
whole
host
of
aunts
and
nieces
while
the
very
walls
seemed
to
reverberate
the
shouts
and
the
pugs
and
mackaw
who
never
failed
to
take
part
in
every
commotion
began
to
bark
and
scream
in
chorus
the
old
gentleman
clapping
his
hands
to
his
ears
rushed
out
of
the
room
his
son
cursing
his
aunts
and
everything
around
him
kicked
cupid
and
gave
the
mackaw
a
box
on
the
ear
as
he
also
quitted
the
apartment
with
more
appearance
of
anger
than
he
had
ever
yet
betrayed
the
tumult
at
length
began
to
subside
the
mackaw
screams
gave
place
to
a
low
quivering
croak
and
the
insulted
pug
yells
yielded
to
a
gentle
whine
the
aunts
obstreperous
joy
began
to
be
chastened
with
fear
for
the
consequences
that
might
follow
an
abrupt
disclosure
and
while
lady
juliana
condoled
with
her
favourites
it
was
concerted
between
the
prudent
aunts
that
the
joyful
news
should
be
broke
to
their
niece
in
the
most
cautious
manner
possible
for
that
purpose
misses
grizzy
and
jacky
seated
themselves
on
each
side
of
her
and
after
duly
preparing
their
voices
by
sundry
small
hems
miss
grizzy
thus
began
i
dare
say
my
dear
lady
juliana
you
must
think
we
are
all
distracted
her
auditor
made
no
attempt
to
contradict
the
supposition
we
certainly
ought
to
be
sure
to
have
been
more
cautious
considering
your
delicate
situation
but
the
joy
though
indeed
it
seems
cruel
to
say
so
and
i
am
sure
you
will
sympathise
my
dear
niece
in
the
cause
when
you
hear
that
it
is
occasioned
by
your
poor
neighbour
death
which
i
sure
was
quite
unexpected
indeed
i
declare
i
conceive
how
it
came
about
for
lady
maclaughlan
who
is
an
excellent
judge
of
these
things
thought
he
was
really
a
remarkably
man
for
his
time
of
life
and
indeed
except
occasional
colds
which
you
know
we
are
all
subject
to
i
really
never
knew
him
complain
at
the
same
time
i
do
think
sister
you
are
taking
the
right
method
of
communicating
the
intelligence
to
our
niece
said
miss
jacky
you
can
not
communicate
anything
that
would
give
me
the
least
pleasure
unless
you
could
tell
me
that
i
was
going
to
leave
this
place
cried
lady
juliana
in
a
voice
of
deep
despondency
indeed
if
it
can
afford
your
ladyship
so
much
pleasure
to
be
at
liberty
to
quit
the
hospitable
mansion
of
your
amiable
respectable
father
said
miss
jacky
with
an
inflamed
visage
and
outspread
hands
you
are
at
perfect
liberty
to
depart
when
you
think
proper
the
generosity
i
may
say
the
munificence
of
my
excellent
brother
has
now
put
it
in
your
power
to
do
as
you
please
and
to
form
your
own
plans
oh
delightful
exclaimed
lady
juliana
starting
up
now
i
shall
be
quite
happy
where
harry
does
he
know
is
he
gone
to
order
the
carriage
can
we
get
away
and
she
was
flying
out
of
the
room
when
miss
jacky
caught
her
by
one
hand
while
miss
grizzy
secured
the
other
oh
pray
do
detain
me
i
must
find
harry
and
i
have
all
my
things
to
put
up
struggling
to
release
herself
from
the
gripe
of
the
sisters
when
the
door
opened
and
harry
entered
eager
yet
dreading
to
know
the
effects
of
the
his
surprise
extreme
at
beholding
his
wife
with
her
eyes
sparkling
her
cheeks
glowing
and
her
whole
countenance
expressing
extreme
pleasure
darting
from
her
keepers
she
bounded
towards
him
with
the
wildest
ejaculations
of
delight
while
he
stood
alternately
gazing
at
her
and
his
aunts
seeking
by
his
eyes
the
explanation
he
feared
to
demand
my
dearest
juliana
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
he
at
length
articulated
oh
you
cunning
thing
so
you
think
i
do
know
that
your
father
has
given
you
a
great
great
quantity
of
money
and
that
we
may
go
away
whenever
we
please
and
do
just
as
we
like
and
live
in
london
and
and
oh
delightful
and
she
bounded
and
skipped
before
the
eyes
of
the
petrified
spinsters
in
the
name
of
heaven
what
does
all
this
mean
asked
henry
addressing
his
aunts
who
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
were
struck
dumb
by
astonishment
but
miss
jacky
at
length
recollecting
herself
turned
to
lady
juliana
who
was
still
testifying
her
delight
by
a
variety
of
childish
but
graceful
movements
and
thus
addressed
her
permit
me
to
put
a
few
questions
to
your
ladyship
in
presence
of
those
who
were
witnesses
of
what
has
already
passed
oh
i
ca
endure
to
be
asked
questions
besides
i
have
no
time
to
answer
them
your
ladyship
must
excuse
me
but
i
ca
permit
you
to
leave
this
room
under
the
influence
of
an
error
have
the
goodness
to
answer
me
the
following
questions
and
you
will
then
be
at
liberty
to
depart
did
i
inform
your
ladyship
that
my
brother
had
given
my
nephew
a
great
quantity
of
money
oh
yes
a
great
great
deal
i
do
know
how
much
though
did
i
returned
her
interrogator
come
come
have
done
with
all
this
confounded
nonsense
exclaimed
henry
passionately
do
you
imagine
i
will
allow
lady
juliana
to
stand
here
all
day
to
answer
all
the
absurd
questions
that
come
into
the
heads
of
three
old
women
you
stupefy
and
bewilder
her
with
your
eternal
tattling
and
roundabout
harangues
and
he
paced
the
room
in
a
paroxysm
of
rage
while
his
wife
suspended
her
dancing
and
stood
in
breathless
amazement
i
declare
i
sure
it
a
thousand
pities
that
there
should
have
been
any
mistake
made
whined
poor
miss
grizzy
the
only
remedy
is
to
explain
the
matter
quickly
observed
miss
nicky
better
late
than
never
i
have
done
said
miss
jacky
seating
herself
with
much
dignity
the
short
and
the
long
of
it
is
this
said
miss
nicky
my
brother
has
not
made
henry
a
present
of
money
i
assure
you
money
is
not
so
rife
but
he
has
done
what
is
much
better
for
you
both
he
has
made
over
to
him
that
fine
thriving
farm
of
poor
macglashan
no
money
repeated
lady
juliana
in
a
disconsolate
tone
then
quickly
brightening
up
it
would
have
been
better
to
be
sure
to
have
had
the
money
directly
but
you
know
we
can
easily
sell
the
estate
how
long
will
it
take
a
week
sell
clackandow
exclaimed
the
three
horrorstruck
daughters
of
the
house
of
douglas
sell
clackandow
oh
oh
oh
what
else
could
we
do
with
it
inquired
her
ladyship
live
at
it
to
be
sure
cried
all
three
live
at
it
repeated
she
with
a
shriek
of
horror
that
vied
with
that
of
the
spinsters
live
at
it
live
on
a
thriving
farm
live
all
my
life
in
such
a
place
as
this
oh
the
very
thought
is
enough
to
kill
me
there
is
no
occasion
to
think
or
say
any
more
about
it
interrupted
henry
in
a
calmer
tone
and
glancing
round
on
his
aunts
i
therefore
desire
no
more
may
be
said
on
the
subject
and
is
this
really
all
and
have
you
got
no
money
and
are
we
not
going
away
gasped
the
disappointed
lady
juliana
as
she
gave
way
to
a
violent
burst
of
tears
that
terminated
in
a
fit
of
hysterics
at
sight
of
which
the
good
spinsters
entirely
forgot
their
wrath
and
while
one
burnt
feathers
under
her
nose
and
another
held
her
hands
a
third
drenched
her
in
floods
of
lady
water
after
going
through
the
regular
routine
the
lady
paroxysm
subsided
and
being
carried
to
bed
she
soon
sobbed
herself
into
a
feverish
slumber
in
which
state
the
harassed
husband
left
her
to
attend
a
summons
from
his
father
chapter

pope
haply
this
life
is
best
sweetest
to
you
well
corresponding
with
your
stiff
age
but
unto
us
it
is
a
cell
of
ignorance
a
prison
for
a
debtor
he
found
the
old
gentleman
in
no
very
complaisant
humour
from
the
disturbances
that
had
taken
place
but
the
chief
cause
of
which
he
was
still
in
ignorance
of
he
therefore
accosted
his
son
with
what
was
the
meaning
o
aw
that
skirling
and
squeeling
i
heard
a
while

by

she

to
my

set

to

trailing

henry
coloured
bit
his
lips
but
made
no
reply
to
this
elegant
address
of
his
father
who
continued
i
sent
for
you
sir
to
have
some
conversation
about
this
farm
of
macglashan
so
sit
down
there
till
i
show
you
the
plans
hardly
conscious
of
what
he
was
doing
poor
henry
gazed
in
silent
confusion
as
his
father
pointed
out
the
various
properties
of
this
his
future
possession
wholly
occupied
in
debating
within
himself
how
he
was
to
decline
the
offer
without
a
downright
quarrel
he
heard
without
understanding
a
word
all
the
old
gentleman
plans
and
proposals
for
building
dikes
draining
moss
etc
and
perfectly
unconscious
of
what
he
was
doing
yielded
a
ready
assent
to
all
the
improvements
that
were
suggested
then
as
for
the
hoose
and
offices
me
see
continued
the
laird
as
he
rolled
up
the
plans
of
the
farm
and
pulled
forth
that
of
the
from
a
bundle
of
papers
ay
here
it
is
by
my
troth
ye
be
weel
lodged
here
the
hoose
is
in
a
manner
quite
new
for
it
has
never
had
a
brush
upon
it
yet
and
there
a
byre
fient
a
bit
if
i
would
mean
the
best
man
i
the
country
to
sleep
there
himsel
a
pause
followed
during
which
glenfern
was
busily
employed
in
poring
over
his
parchment
then
taking
off
his
spectacles
and
surveying
his
son
and
now
sir
that
you
heard
a
the
oots
an
ins
o
the
business
what
think
you
your
farm
should
bring
you
at
the
year
end
i
i
i
sure
i
i
do
know
stammered
poor
henry
awakening
from
his
reverie
come
come
a
guess
i
really
i
can
not
i
have
the
least
idea
i
desire
sir
ye
say
something
directly
that
i
may
judge
whether
or
no
ye
common
sense
cried
the
old
gentleman
angrily
i
should
do
suppose
it
will
exceed
seven
or
eight
hundred
a
year
said
his
son
in
the
greatest
trepidation
at
this
trial
of
his
intellect
seven
or
eight
hunder
deevils
cried
the
incensed
laird
starting
up
and
pushing
his
papers
from
him
by
my
faith
i
believe
ye
a
born
idiot
seven
or
eight
hunder
pounds
repeated
he
at
least
a
dozen
times
as
he
whisked
up
and
down
the
little
apartment
with
extraordinary
velocity
while
poor
henry
affected
to
be
busily
employed
in
gathering
up
the
parchments
with
which
the
floor
was
strewed
i
tell
you
what
sir
continued
he
stopping
you
no
fit
to
manage
a
farm
you
as
ignorant
as
yon
coo
an
as
senseless
as
its
cauf
wi
gude
management
clackandow
should
produce
you
twahunder
and
odd
pounds
yearly
but
in
your
guiding
i
doot
if
it
will
yield
the
half
however
tak
it
or
want
it
mind
me
sir
that
it
a
ye
to
trust
to
in
my
lifetime
so
ye
may
mak
the
maist
various
and
painful
were
the
emotions
that
struggled
in
henry
breast
at
this
declaration
shame
regret
indignation
all
burned
within
him
but
the
fear
he
entertained
of
his
father
and
the
consciousness
of
his
absolute
dependence
chained
his
tongue
while
the
bitter
emotions
that
agitated
him
painted
themselves
legibly
in
his
countenance
his
father
observed
his
agitation
and
mistaking
the
cause
felt
somewhat
softened
at
what
he
conceived
his
son
shame
and
penitence
for
his
folly
he
therefore
extended
his
hand
towards
him
saying
weel
weel
nae
mairaboot
it
clackandow
yours
as
soon
as
i
can
put
you
in
possession
in
the
meantime
stay
still
here
and
welcome
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
offer
sir
i
feel
very
grateful
for
your
kindness
at
length
articulated
his
son
but
i
am
as
you
observe
so
perfectly
ignorant
of
country
matters
that
i
i
in
short
i
am
afraid
i
should
make
a
bad
hand
of
the
business
nae
doot
nae
doot
ye
would
if
ye
was
left
to
your

discretion
but
ye
get
mair
sense
and
i
shall
put
ye
upon
a
method
and
provide
ye
wi
a
grieve
an
if
you
are

your

sir
has
never

accustomed
let
her
serve
an
apprenticeship
to
your
aunts
she
couldna
be
in
a
better
school
but
her
education
sir
has
been
so
different
from
what
would
be
required
in
that
station
resumed
her
husband
choking
with
vexation
at
the
idea
of
his
beauteous
bride
being
doomed
to
the
drudgery
of
household
cares
edication
what
has
her
edication
been
to
mak
her
different

their

but
the

continued
the
tender
husband
almost
driven
to
extremities
by
the
persevering
simplicity
of
his
father
stay
a
wee
till
she
gets
to
clackandow
there
no
a
finer
situation
in
a
scotland
the
air
sharpish
to
be
sure
but
fine
and
bracing
and
you
have
a
braw
at
your
back
to
keep
you
warm
finding
it
in
vain
to
attempt
his
objections
to
a
pastoral
life
poor
henry
was
at
length
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
coming
to
the
point
with
the
old
gentleman
and
telling
him
plainly
that
it
was
not
at
all
suited
to
his
inclinations
or
lady
juliana
rank
and
beauty
vain
would
be
the
attempt
to
paint
the
fiery
wrath
and
indignation
of
the
ancient
highlander
as
the
naked
truth
stood
revealed
before
him
that
his
son
despised
the
occupation
of
his
fathers
even
the
feeding
of
sheep
and
the
breeding
of
black
cattle
and
that
his
spouse
was
above
fulfilling
those
duties
which
he
had
ever
considered
the
chief
end
for
which
woman
was
created
he
swore
stamped
screamed
and
even
skipped
with
rage
and
in
short
went
through
all
the
evolutions
as
usually
performed
by
testy
old
gentlemen
on
first
discovering
that
they
have
disobedient
sons
and
undutiful
daughters
henry
who
though
uncommonly
inherited
a
portion
of
his
father
warmth
became
at
length
irritated
at
the
invectives
that
were
so
liberally
bestowed
on
him
and
replied
in
language
less
respectful
than
the
old
laird
was
accustomed
to
hear
and
the
altercation
became
so
violent
that
they
parted
in
mutual
anger
henry
returning
to
his
apartment
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
disquietude
he
had
ever
known
to
her
childish
complaints
and
tiresome
complaints
he
no
longer
vouchsafed
to
reply
but
paced
the
chamber
with
a
disordered
mien
in
sullen
silence
till
at
length
distracted
by
her
reproaches
and
disgusted
with
her
selfishness
he
rushed
from
the
apartment
and
quitted
the
house
chapter
xiii
never
talk
to
me
i
will
weep
you
like
twice
had
the
dinner
bell
been
loudly
sounded
by
old
donald
and
the
family
of
glenfern
were
all
assembled
yet
their
fashionable
guests
had
not
appeared
impatient
of
delay
miss
jacky
hastened
to
ascertain
the
cause
presently
she
returned
in
the
utmost
perturbation
and
announced
that
lady
juliana
was
in
bed
in
a
high
fever
and
henry
nowhere
to
be
found
the
whole
eight
rushed
upstairs
to
ascertain
the
fact
leaving
the
old
gentleman
much
discomposed
at
this
unseasonable
delay
some
time
elapsed
ere
they
again
returned
which
they
did
with
lengthened
faces
and
in
extreme
perturbation
they
had
found
their
noble
niece
according
to
miss
jacky
report
in
to
miss
grizzy
opinion
in
a
brain
fever
as
she
no
sooner
perceived
them
enter
than
she
covered
her
head
with
the
bedclothes
and
continued
screaming
for
them
to
be
gone
till
they
had
actually
quitted
the
apartment
and
what
proves
beyond
a
doubt
that
our
sweet
niece
is
not
herself
continued
poor
miss
grizzy
in
a
lamentable
tone
is
that
we
appeared
to
her
in
every
form
but
our
own
she
sometimes
took
us
for
cats
then
thought
we
were
ghosts
haunting
her
and
in
short
it
is
impossible
to
tell
all
the
things
she
called
us
and
she
screams
so
for
harry
to
come
and
take
her
away
that
i
am
sure
i
declare
i
do
know
what
come
over
her
douglas
could
scarce
suppress
a
smile
at
the
simplicity
of
the
good
spinsters
her
husband
and
she
had
gone
out
immediately
after
breakfast
to
pay
a
visit
a
few
miles
off
and
did
not
return
till
near
the
dinner
hour
they
were
therefore
ignorant
of
all
that
had
been
acted
during
their
absence
but
as
she
suspected
something
was
amiss
she
requested
the
rest
of
the
company
would
proceed
to
dinner
and
leave
her
to
ascertain
the
nature
of
lady
juliana
disorder
do
come
near
me
shrieked
her
ladyship
on
hearing
the
door
open
send
harry
to
take
me
away
i
do
want
anybody
but
harry
and
a
torrent
of
tears
sobs
and
exclamations
followed
my
dear
lady
juliana
said
douglas
softly
approaching
the
bed
compose
yourself
and
if
my
presence
is
disagreeable
to
you
i
shall
immediately
withdraw
oh
is
it
you
cried
her
uncovering
her
face
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
i
thought
it
had
been
these
frightful
old
women
come
to
torment
me
and
i
shall
die
i
know
i
shall
if
ever
i
look
at
them
again
but
i
do
dislike
so
you
may
stay
if
you
choose
though
i
do
want
anybody
but
harry
to
come
and
take
me
away
a
fresh
fit
of
sobbing
here
impeded
her
utterance
and
douglas
compassionating
her
distress
while
she
despised
her
folly
seated
herself
by
the
bedside
and
taking
her
hand
in
the
sweetest
tone
of
complacency
attempted
to
soothe
her
into
composure
the
only
way
in
which
you
can
be
less
miserable
said
douglas
in
a
soothing
tone
is
to
support
your
present
situation
with
patience
which
you
may
do
by
looking
forward
to
brighter
prospects
it
is
that
your
stay
here
may
be
short
and
it
is
that
it
is
in
your
own
power
to
render
your
life
more
agreeable
by
endeavouring
to
accommodate
yourself
to
the
peculiarities
of
your
husband
family
no
doubt
they
are
often
tiresome
and
ridiculous
but
they
are
always
kind
and
you
may
say
what
you
please
but
i
think
them
all
odious
creatures
and
i
wo
live
here
with
patience
and
i
sha
be
agreeable
to
them
and
all
the
talking
in
the
world
wo
make
me
less
miserable
if
you
were
me
you
would
be
just
the
same
but
you
have
never
been
in
london
that
the
reason
pardon
me
replied
her
i
spent
many
years
of
my
life
there
you
lived
in
london
repeated
lady
juliana
in
astonishment
and
how
then
can
you
contrive
to
exist
here
i
not
only
contrive
to
exist
but
to
be
extremely
contented
with
existence
said
douglas
with
a
smile
then
assuming
a
more
serious
air
i
possess
health
peace
of
mind
and
the
affections
of
a
worthy
husband
and
i
should
be
very
undeserving
of
these
blessings
were
i
to
give
way
to
useless
regrets
or
indulge
in
impious
repinings
because
my
happiness
might
once
have
been
more
perfect
and
still
admits
of
improvement
i
do
understand
you
said
lady
juliana
with
a
peevish
yawn
who
did
you
live
with
in
london
with
my
aunt
lady
audley
with
lady
audley
repeated
her
in
accents
of
astonishment
why
i
have
heard
of
her
she
lived
quite
in
the
world
and
gave
balls
and
assemblies
so
that
the
reason
you
are
not
so
disagreeable
as
the
rest
of
them
why
did
you
not
remain
with
her
or
marry
an
englishman
but
i
suppose
like
me
you
did
know
what
scotland
was
happy
to
have
excited
an
interest
even
through
the
medium
of
childish
curiosity
in
the
bosom
of
her
fashionable
relative
douglas
briefly
related
such
circumstances
of
her
past
life
as
she
judged
proper
to
communicate
but
as
she
sought
rather
to
amuse
than
instruct
by
her
simple
narrative
we
shall
allow
her
to
pursue
her
charitable
intentions
while
we
do
more
justice
to
her
character
by
introducing
her
regularly
to
the
acquaintance
of
our
readers
history
of
douglas
the
selfish
heart
deserves
the
pang
it
feels
more
generous
sorrow
while
it
sinks
exalts
and
conscious
virtue
mitigates
the
pang
young
douglas
was
on
the
maternal
side
related
to
an
english
family
her
mother
had
died
in
giving
birth
to
her
and
her
father
shortly
after
falling
in
the
service
of
his
country
she
had
been
consigned
in
infancy
to
the
care
of
her
aunt
lady
audley
had
taken
charge
of
her
on
condition
that
she
should
never
be
claimed
by
her
scottish
relations
for
whom
that
lady
entertained
as
much
aversion
as
contempt
a
latent
feeling
of
affection
for
her
departed
sister
and
a
large
portion
of
family
pride
had
prompted
her
wish
of
becoming
the
protectress
of
her
orphan
niece
and
possessed
of
a
high
sense
of
rectitude
and
honour
she
fulfilled
the
duty
thus
voluntarily
imposed
in
a
manner
that
secured
the
unshaken
gratitude
of
the
virtuous
alicia
lady
audley
was
a
character
more
esteemed
and
feared
than
loved
even
by
those
with
whom
she
was
most
intimate
firm
upright
and
rigid
she
exacted
from
others
those
inflexible
virtues
which
in
herself
she
found
no
obstacle
to
performing
neglecting
these
softer
attractions
which
shed
their
benign
influence
over
the
commerce
of
social
life
she
was
content
to
enjoy
the
extorted
esteem
of
her
associates
for
friends
she
had
none
she
sought
in
the
world
for
objects
to
fill
up
the
void
which
her
heart
could
not
supply
she
loved
and
had
succeeded
in
creating
herself
an
existence
of
importance
in
the
circles
of
high
life
which
she
considered
more
as
due
to
her
consequence
than
essential
to
her
enjoyment
she
had
early
in
life
been
left
a
widow
with
the
sole
tutelage
and
management
of
an
only
son
whose
large
estate
she
regulated
with
the
most
admirable
prudence
and
judgment
alicia
malcolm
was
put
under
the
care
of
her
aunt
at
two
years
of
age
a
governess
had
been
procured
for
her
whose
character
was
such
as
not
to
impair
the
promising
dispositions
of
her
pupil
alicia
was
gifted
by
nature
with
a
warm
affectionate
heart
and
a
calm
imagination
attempered
its
influence
her
governess
a
woman
of
a
strong
understanding
and
enlarged
mind
early
instilled
into
her
a
deep
and
strong
sense
of
religion
and
to
it
she
owed
the
support
which
had
safely
guided
her
through
the
most
trying
vicissitudes
when
at
the
age
of
seventeen
alicia
malcolm
was
produced
in
the
world
she
was
a
rational
cheerful
and
girl
with
a
finely
formed
person
and
a
countenance
in
which
was
so
clearly
painted
the
sunshine
of
her
breast
that
it
attracted
the
even
of
those
who
had
not
taste
or
judgment
to
define
the
charm
her
open
natural
manner
blending
the
frankness
of
the
scotch
with
the
polished
reserve
of
the
english
woman
her
total
exemption
from
vanity
calculated
alike
to
please
others
and
maintain
her
own
cheerfulness
undimmed
by
a
single
cloud
lady
audley
felt
for
her
niece
a
sentiment
which
she
mistook
for
affection
her
was
gratified
at
the
contemplation
of
a
being
who
owed
every
advantage
to
her
and
whom
she
had
rescued
from
the
coarseness
and
vulgarity
which
she
deemed
inseparable
from
the
manners
of
every
scotchwoman
if
lady
audley
really
loved
any
human
being
it
was
her
son
in
him
were
centred
her
dearest
interests
on
his
aggrandisement
and
future
importance
hung
her
most
sanguine
hopes
she
had
acted
contrary
to
the
advice
of
her
male
relations
and
followed
her
own
judgment
by
giving
her
son
a
private
education
he
was
brought
up
under
her
own
eye
by
a
tutor
of
deep
erudition
but
who
was
totally
unfitted
for
forming
the
mind
and
compensating
for
those
advantages
which
may
be
derived
from
a
public
education
the
circumstances
of
his
education
however
combined
rather
to
stifle
the
exposure
than
to
destroy
the
existence
of
some
very
dangerous
qualities
that
seemed
inherent
in
sir
edmund
nature
he
was
ardent
impetuous
and
passionate
though
these
propensities
were
cloaked
by
a
reserve
partly
natural
and
partly
arising
from
of
his
mother
and
tutor
his
was
not
the
effervescence
of
character
which
bursts
forth
on
every
trivial
occasion
but
when
any
powerful
cause
awakened
the
slumbering
inmates
of
his
breast
they
blazed
with
an
uncontrolled
fury
that
defied
all
opposition
and
overleaped
all
bounds
of
reason
and
decorum
experience
often
shows
us
that
minds
formed
of
the
most
opposite
attributes
more
forcibly
attract
each
other
than
those
which
appear
cast
in
the
same
mould
the
source
of
this
fascination
is
difficult
to
trace
it
possesses
not
reason
for
its
basis
yet
it
is
perhaps
the
more
tyrannical
in
its
influence
from
that
very
cause
the
weakness
of
our
natures
occasionally
makes
us
feel
a
potent
charm
in
errors
of
a
noble
mind
sir
edmund
audley
and
alicia
malcolm
proved
examples
of
this
observation
the
affection
of
childhood
had
so
gradually
ripened
into
a
warmer
sentiment
that
neither
was
conscious
of
the
nature
of
that
sentiment
till
after
it
had
attained
strength
to
cast
a
material
influence
on
their
after
lives
the
familiarity
of
near
relatives
associating
constantly
together
produced
a
warm
sentiment
of
affection
cemented
by
similarity
of
pursuits
and
enlivened
by
diversity
of
character
while
the
perfect
tranquillity
of
their
lives
afforded
no
event
that
could
withdraw
the
veil
of
ignorance
from
their
eyes
could
a
woman
of
lady
audley
discernment
it
may
be
asked
place
two
young
persons
in
such
a
situation
and
doubt
the
consequences
those
who
are
no
longer
young
are
liable
to
forget
that
love
is
a
plant
of
early
growth
and
that
the
individuals
that
they
have
but
a
short
time
before
beheld
placing
their
supreme
felicity
on
a
rattle
and
a
can
so
soon
be
actuated
by
the
strongest
passions
of
the
human
breast
sir
edmund
completed
his
nineteenth
year
and
alicia
entered
her
eighteenth
when
this
happy
state
of
unconscious
security
was
destroyed
by
a
circumstance
which
rent
the
veil
from
her
eyes
and
disclosed
his
sentiments
in
all
their
energy
and
warmth
this
circumstance
was
no
other
than
a
proposal
of
marriage
to
alicia
from
a
gentleman
of
large
fortune
and
brilliant
connexions
who
resided
in
their
neighbourhood
his
character
was
as
little
calculated
as
his
appearance
to
engage
the
affections
of
a
young
woman
of
delicacy
and
good
sense
but
he
was
a
man
of
consequence
heir
to
an
earldom
member
for
the
county
and
lady
audley
rejoicing
at
what
she
termed
alicia
good
fortune
determined
that
she
should
become
his
wife
with
mild
firmness
she
rejected
the
honour
intended
her
but
it
was
with
difficulty
that
lady
audley
mind
could
adopt
or
understand
the
idea
of
an
opposition
to
her
wishes
she
could
not
seriously
embrace
the
conviction
that
alicia
was
determined
to
disobey
her
and
in
order
to
bring
her
to
a
right
understanding
she
underwent
a
system
of
persecution
that
tended
naturally
to
increase
the
antipathy
her
suitor
had
inspired
lady
audley
with
the
indiscriminating
zeal
of
prejudiced
and
overbearing
persons
strove
to
recommend
him
to
her
niece
br
all
those
attributes
which
were
of
value
in
her
own
eyes
making
allowance
for
a
certain
degree
of
in
decision
in
her
niece
but
never
admitting
a
doubt
that
in
due
time
her
will
should
be
obeyed
as
it
had
always
hitherto
been
at
this
juncture
sir
edmund
came
down
to
the
country
and
was
struck
by
the
altered
looks
and
pensive
manners
of
his
once
cheerful
cousin
about
a
week
after
his
arrival
he
found
alicia
one
morning
in
tears
after
a
long
conversation
with
lady
audley
sir
edmund
tenderly
soothed
her
and
entreated
to
be
made
acquainted
with
the
cause
of
her
distress
she
was
so
habituated
to
impart
every
thought
to
her
cousin
the
intimacy
and
sympathy
of
their
souls
were
so
entire
that
she
would
not
have
concealed
the
late
occurrence
from
him
had
she
not
been
withheld
by
the
natural
timidity
and
delicacy
a
young
woman
feels
in
making
her
own
conquests
the
subject
of
conversation
but
now
so
pathetically
and
irresistibly
persuaded
by
sir
edmund
and
sensible
that
every
distress
of
hers
wounded
his
heart
alicia
candidly
related
to
him
the
pursuit
of
her
disagreeable
suitor
and
the
importunities
of
lady
audley
in
his
favour
every
word
she
had
spoken
had
more
and
more
dispelled
the
mist
that
had
so
long
hung
over
sir
edmund
inclinations
at
the
first
mention
of
a
suitor
he
had
felt
that
to
be
hers
was
a
happiness
that
comprised
all
others
and
that
the
idea
of
losing
her
made
the
whole
of
existence
appear
a
frightful
blank
these
feelings
were
no
sooner
known
to
himself
than
spontaneously
poured
into
her
delighted
ears
while
she
felt
that
every
sentiment
met
a
kindred
one
in
her
breast
alicia
sought
not
a
moment
to
disguise
those
feelings
which
she
now
for
the
first
time
became
aware
of
they
were
known
to
the
object
of
her
innocent
affection
as
soon
as
to
herself
and
both
were
convinced
that
though
not
conscious
before
of
the
nature
of
their
sentiments
love
had
long
been
mistaken
for
friendship
in
their
hearts
but
this
state
of
blissful
serenity
did
not
last
long
on
the
evening
of
the
following
day
lady
audley
sent
for
her
to
her
on
entering
alicia
was
at
her
aunt
pale
countenance
fiery
eyes
and
frame
convulsed
with
passion
with
difficulty
lady
audley
struggling
for
calmness
demanded
an
instant
and
decided
reply
to
the
proposals
of
compton
the
gentleman
who
had
solicited
her
hand
alicia
entreated
her
aunt
to
waive
the
subject
as
she
found
it
impossible
ever
to
consent
to
such
a
union
scarcely
was
her
answer
uttered
when
lady
audley
anger
burst
forth
uncontrollably
she
accused
her
niece
of
the
vilest
ingratitude
in
having
seduced
her
son
from
the
obedience
he
owed
his
mother
of
having
plotted
to
ally
her
base
scotch
blood
to
the
noble
blood
of
the
audleys
and
having
exhausted
every
opprobrious
epithet
she
was
forced
to
stop
from
want
of
breath
to
proceed
as
alicia
listened
to
the
cruel
unfounded
reproaches
of
her
aunt
her
spirit
rose
under
the
unmerited
but
her
conscience
absolved
her
from
all
intention
of
injuring
or
deceiving
a
human
being
and
she
calmly
waited
till
lady
audley
anger
should
have
exhausted
itself
and
then
entreated
to
know
what
part
of
her
conduct
had
excited
her
aunt
displeasure
lady
audley
reply
was
diffuse
and
intemperate
alicia
gathered
from
it
that
her
rage
had
its
source
in
a
declaration
her
son
had
made
to
her
of
his
affection
for
his
cousin
and
his
resolution
of
marrying
her
as
soon
as
he
was
of
age
which
open
avowal
of
his
sentiments
had
followed
lady
audley
injunctions
to
him
to
forward
the
suit
of
compton
that
her
son
for
whom
she
had
in
view
one
of
the
first
matches
in
the
kingdom
should
dare
to
choose
for
himself
and
above
all
to
choose
one
whom
she
considered
as
much
his
inferior
in
birth
as
she
was
in
fortune
was
a
circumstance
quite
insupportable
to
her
feelings
of
the
existence
of
love
lady
audley
had
little
conception
and
she
attributed
her
son
conduct
to
wilful
disobedience
and
obstinacy
in
proportion
as
she
had
hitherto
found
him
complying
and
gentle
her
wrath
had
kindled
at
his
present
firmness
and
inflexibility
so
bitter
were
her
reflections
on
his
conduct
so
severe
her
animadversions
on
the
being
he
loved
that
sir
edmund
fired
with
resentment
expressed
his
resolution
of
acting
according
to
the
dictates
of
his
own
will
and
expressed
his
contempt
for
her
authority
in
terms
the
most
unequivocal
lady
audley
ignorant
of
the
arts
of
persuasion
by
every
word
she
uttered
more
and
more
widened
the
breach
her
imperiousness
had
occasioned
until
sir
edmund
feeling
himself
no
longer
master
of
his
temper
announced
his
intention
of
leaving
the
house
to
allow
his
mother
time
to
reconcile
herself
to
the
inevitable
misfortune
of
beholding
him
the
husband
of
alicia
malcolm
he
instantly
ordered
his
horses
and
departed
leaving
the
following
letter
for
his
cousin
i
have
been
compelled
by
motives
of
prudence
of
which
you
are
the
sole
object
to
depart
without
seeing
you
my
absence
became
necessary
from
the
unexpected
conduct
of
lady
audley
which
has
led
me
so
near
to
forgetting
that
she
was
my
mother
that
i
dare
not
remain
and
subject
myself
to
excesses
of
temper
which
i
might
afterwards
repent
two
years
must
elapse
before
i
can
become
legally
my
own
master
and
should
lady
audley
so
far
depart
from
the
dictates
of
cool
judgment
as
still
to
oppose
what
she
knows
to
be
inevitable
i
fear
that
we
can
not
meet
till
then
my
heart
is
well
known
to
you
therefore
i
need
not
enlarge
on
the
pain
i
feel
at
this
separation
at
the
same
time
i
am
cheered
with
the
prospect
of
the
unspeakable
happiness
that
awaits
possession
of
your
hand
and
the
confidence
i
feel
in
your
constancy
is
in
proportion
to
the
certainty
i
experience
in
my
own
i
can
not
therefore
fear
that
any
of
the
means
which
may
be
put
in
practice
to
disunite
us
will
have
more
effect
on
you
than
on
me
looking
forward
to
the
moment
that
shall
make
you
mine
for
ever
i
remain
with
steady
confidence
and
unspeakable
affection
your
edmund
audley
with
a
trembling
frame
alicia
handed
the
note
to
lady
audley
and
begged
leave
to
retire
for
a
short
time
expressing
her
willingness
to
reply
at
another
moment
to
any
question
her
aunt
might
choose
to
put
to
her
with
regard
to
her
engagement
with
sir
edmund
in
the
solitude
of
her
own
chamber
alicia
gave
way
to
those
feelings
of
wretchedness
which
she
had
with
difficulty
stifled
in
the
presence
of
lady
audley
and
bitterly
wept
over
the
extinction
of
her
bright
and
visions
of
felicity
to
yield
to
unmerited
or
to
crouch
beneath
imperious
and
power
was
not
in
the
nature
of
alicia
and
had
lady
audley
been
a
stranger
to
her
the
path
of
duty
would
have
been
less
intricate
however
much
her
own
pride
might
have
been
wounded
by
entering
into
a
family
which
considered
her
as
an
intruding
beggar
never
would
she
have
consented
to
sacrifice
the
virtuous
inclinations
of
the
man
she
loved
to
the
will
of
an
arrogant
and
imperious
mother
but
alas
the
case
was
far
different
the
recent
she
had
experienced
from
lady
audley
could
not
efface
from
her
noble
mind
the
recollection
of
benefits
conferred
from
the
earliest
period
of
her
life
and
of
unvarying
attention
to
her
welfare
to
her
aunt
she
owed
all
but
existence
she
had
wholly
supported
her
bestowed
on
her
the
most
liberal
education
and
from
lady
audley
sprang
every
pleasure
she
had
hitherto
enjoyed
had
she
been
brought
up
by
her
paternal
relations
she
would
in
all
probability
never
have
beheld
her
cousin
and
the
mother
and
son
might
have
lived
in
uninterrupted
concord
could
she
be
the
person
to
inflict
on
lady
audley
the
severest
disappointment
she
could
experience
the
thought
was
too
dreadful
to
bear
and
knowing
that
procrastination
could
but
increase
her
misery
no
sooner
had
she
felt
convinced
of
the
true
nature
of
her
duty
than
she
made
a
steady
resolution
to
perform
and
to
adhere
to
it
lady
audley
had
that
while
she
had
life
she
could
never
give
her
consent
and
approbation
to
her
son
marriage
and
alicia
was
too
well
acquainted
with
her
disposition
to
have
the
faintest
expectation
that
she
would
relent
but
to
remain
any
longer
under
her
protection
was
impossible
and
she
resolved
to
anticipate
any
proposal
of
that
sort
from
her
protectress
when
lady
audley
passion
had
somewhat
cooled
she
again
sent
for
alicia
she
began
by
repeating
her
to
the
marriage
in
a
manner
impressive
to
the
greatest
degree
and
still
more
decisive
in
its
form
by
the
cool
collectedness
of
her
manner
she
then
desired
to
hear
what
alicia
had
to
say
in
exculpation
of
her
conduct
the
profound
sorrow
which
filled
the
heart
of
alicia
left
no
room
for
timidity
or
indecision
she
answered
her
without
hesitation
and
embarrassment
and
asserted
her
innocence
of
all
deceit
in
such
a
manner
as
to
leave
no
doubt
at
least
of
honourable
proceeding
in
a
few
impressive
words
she
proved
herself
sensible
of
the
benefits
her
aunt
had
through
life
conferred
upon
her
and
while
she
openly
professed
to
think
herself
in
the
present
instance
deeply
wronged
she
declared
her
determination
of
never
uniting
herself
to
her
cousin
without
lady
audley
permission
which
she
felt
convinced
was
unattainable
she
then
proceeded
to
ask
where
she
should
deem
it
most
advisable
for
her
to
reside
in
future
happy
to
find
her
wishes
thus
prevented
the
unfeeling
aunt
expressed
her
satisfaction
at
alicia
good
sense
and
discretion
represented
in
what
she
thought
glowing
colours
the
presumption
it
would
have
been
in
her
to
take
advantage
of
sir
edmund
momentary
infatuation
and
then
launched
out
into
details
of
her
ambitious
views
for
him
in
a
matrimonial
alliance
views
which
she
affected
now
to
consider
without
obstacle
alicia
interrupted
the
painful
and
unfeeling
harangue
it
was
neither
she
said
for
sir
edmund
advantage
nor
to
gratify
his
mother
pride
but
to
perform
the
dictates
of
her
own
conscience
that
she
had
resigned
him
she
even
ventured
to
declare
that
the
sharpest
pang
which
that
resignation
had
cost
her
was
the
firm
conviction
that
it
would
inflict
upon
him
a
deep
and
lasting
sorrow
lady
audley
convinced
that
moderate
measures
would
be
most
likely
to
ensure
a
continuation
of
alicia
obedience
expressed
herself
grieved
at
the
necessity
of
parting
with
her
and
pleased
that
she
should
have
the
good
sense
to
perceive
the
propriety
of
such
a
separation
sir
duncan
malcolm
the
grandfather
of
alicia
had
in
the
few
communications
that
had
passed
between
lady
audley
and
him
always
expressed
a
wish
to
see
his
granddaughter
before
he
died
her
antipathy
to
scotland
was
such
that
she
would
have
deemed
it
absolute
contamination
for
her
niece
to
have
entered
the
country
and
she
had
therefore
always
eluded
the
request
it
was
now
of
all
plans
the
most
eligible
and
she
graciously
offered
to
convey
her
niece
as
far
as
edinburgh
the
journey
was
immediately
settled
and
before
alicia
left
her
aunt
presence
a
promise
was
exacted
with
unfeeling
tenacity
and
given
with
melancholy
firmness
never
to
unite
herself
to
sir
edmund
unsanctioned
by
his
mother
alas
how
imperfect
is
human
wisdom
even
in
seeking
to
do
right
how
many
are
the
errors
we
commit
alicia
judged
wrong
in
thus
sacrificing
the
happiness
of
sir
edmund
to
the
pride
and
injustice
of
his
mother
but
her
error
was
that
of
a
noble
spirit
entitled
to
respect
even
though
it
can
not
claim
approbation
the
honourable
open
conduct
of
her
niece
had
so
far
gained
upon
lady
audley
that
she
did
not
object
to
her
writing
to
sir
edmund
dear
sir
edmund
a
painful
line
of
conduct
is
pointed
out
to
me
by
duty
yet
of
all
the
regrets
i
feel
not
one
is
so
poignant
as
the
consciousness
of
that
which
you
will
feel
at
learning
that
i
have
forever
resigned
the
claims
you
so
lately
gave
me
to
your
heart
and
hand
it
was
not
weakness
it
could
not
be
inconstancy
that
produced
the
painful
sacrifice
of
a
distinction
still
more
gratifying
to
my
heart
than
flattering
to
my
pride
need
i
remind
you
that
to
your
mother
i
owe
every
benefit
in
life
nothing
can
release
me
from
the
tribute
of
gratitude
which
would
be
ill
repaid
by
braving
her
authority
and
despising
her
will
should
i
give
her
reason
to
regret
the
hour
she
received
me
under
her
roof
to
repent
of
every
benefit
she
has
hitherto
bestowed
on
me
should
i
draw
down
a
mother
displeasure
what
reasonable
hopes
could
we
entertain
of
solid
peace
through
life
i
am
not
in
a
situation
which
entitles
me
to
question
the
justice
of
lady
audley
will
and
that
will
has
pronounced
that
i
shall
never
be
sir
edmund
wife
your
first
impulse
may
perhaps
be
to
accuse
me
of
coldness
and
ingratitude
in
quitting
the
place
and
country
you
inhabit
and
resigning
you
back
to
yourself
without
personally
taking
leave
of
you
but
i
trust
that
you
will
on
reflection
absolve
me
from
the
charge
could
i
have
had
any
grounds
to
suppose
that
a
personal
interview
would
be
productive
of
comfort
to
you
i
would
have
joyfully
supported
the
sufferings
it
would
have
inflicted
on
myself
but
question
your
own
heart
as
to
the
use
you
would
have
made
of
such
a
meeting
bear
in
mind
that
lady
audley
has
my
solemn
promise
never
to
be
yours
a
promise
not
lightly
given
then
imagine
what
must
have
been
an
interview
between
us
under
such
circumstances
in
proof
of
an
affection
which
i
can
have
no
reason
to
doubt
i
conjure
you
to
listen
to
the
last
request
i
shall
ever
make
to
my
dear
cousin
give
me
the
heartfelt
satisfaction
to
know
that
my
departure
has
put
an
end
to
those
disagreements
between
mother
and
son
of
which
i
have
been
the
innocent
cause
you
have
no
reason
to
blame
lady
audley
for
this
last
step
of
mine
i
have
not
been
intimidated
threats
believe
me
never
would
have
extorted
from
me
a
promise
to
renounce
you
had
not
virtue
herself
dictated
the
sacrifice
and
my
reward
will
spring
from
the
conviction
that
as
far
as
my
judgment
could
discern
i
have
acted
right
forget
i
entreat
you
this
inauspicious
passion
resolve
like
me
to
resign
yourself
without
murmuring
to
what
is
now
past
recall
and
instead
of
indulging
melancholy
regain
by
a
timely
exertion
of
mind
and
body
that
serenity
which
is
the
portion
of
those
who
have
obeyed
the
dictates
of
rectitude
farewell
sir
edmund
may
every
happiness
attend
your
future
life
while
i
strive
to
forget
my
affection
the
still
stronger
feelings
of
gratitude
and
esteem
for
you
can
never
fade
from
the
heart
of
alicia
malcolm
to
say
that
no
tears
were
shed
during
the
composition
of
this
letter
would
be
to
overstrain
fortitude
beyond
natural
bounds
with
difficulty
alicia
checked
the
effusions
of
her
pen
she
wished
to
have
said
much
more
and
to
have
soothed
the
agony
of
renunciation
by
painting
with
warmth
her
tenderness
and
her
regret
but
reason
urged
that
in
exciting
his
feelings
and
displaying
her
own
she
would
defeat
the
chief
purpose
of
her
letter
she
hastily
closed
and
directed
it
with
a
feeling
almost
akin
to
despair
the
necessary
arrangements
for
the
journey
having
been
hastily
made
the
ladies
set
out
two
days
after
sir
edmund
had
so
hastily
quitted
them
the
uncomplaining
alicia
buried
her
woes
in
her
own
bosom
and
neither
murmurs
on
the
one
hand
nor
reproaches
on
the
other
were
heard
at
the
end
of
four
days
the
travellers
entered
scotland
and
when
they
stopped
for
the
night
alicia
fatigued
and
dispirited
retired
immediately
to
her
apartment
she
had
been
there
but
a
few
minutes
when
the
chambermaid
knocked
at
the
door
and
informed
her
that
she
was
wanted
below
supposing
that
lady
audley
had
sent
for
her
she
followed
the
girl
without
observing
that
she
was
conducted
in
an
opposite
direction
when
upon
entering
an
apartment
what
was
her
astonishment
at
finding
herself
not
in
the
presence
of
lady
audley
but
in
the
arms
of
sir
edmund
in
the
utmost
agitation
she
sought
to
disengage
herself
from
his
almost
frantic
embrace
while
he
poured
forth
a
torrent
of
rapturous
exclamations
and
swore
that
no
human
power
should
ever
divide
them
again
i
have
followed
your
steps
dearest
alicia
from
the
moment
i
received
your
letter
we
are
now
in
this
blessed
land
of
liberty
everything
is
arranged
the
clergyman
is
now
in
waiting
and
in
five
minutes
you
shall
be
my
own
beyond
the
power
of
fate
to
sever
us
too
much
agitated
to
reply
alicia
wept
in
silence
and
in
the
delight
of
once
more
beholding
him
she
had
thought
never
more
to
behold
forgot
for
a
moment
the
duty
she
had
imposed
upon
herself
but
the
native
energy
of
her
character
returned
she
raised
her
head
and
attempted
to
withdraw
from
the
encircling
arms
of
her
cousin
never
until
you
have
vowed
to
be
mine
the
clergyman
the
carriage
everything
is
in
readiness
speak
but
the
word
dearest
and
he
knelt
at
her
feet
at
this
juncture
the
door
opened
and
pale
with
rage
her
eyes
flashing
fire
lady
audley
stood
before
them
a
dreadful
scene
now
ensued
sir
edmund
disdained
to
enter
into
any
justification
of
his
conduct
or
even
to
reply
to
the
invectives
of
his
mother
but
lavished
the
most
tender
assiduities
on
alicia
who
overcome
more
by
the
conflicts
of
her
own
heart
than
with
alarm
at
lady
audley
violence
sat
the
pale
and
silent
image
of
consternation
baffled
by
her
son
indignant
disregard
lady
audley
turned
all
her
fury
on
her
niece
and
in
the
most
opprobrious
terms
that
rage
could
invent
upbraided
her
with
deceit
and
treachery
accusing
her
of
making
her
pretended
submission
instrumental
to
the
more
speedy
accomplishment
of
her
marriage
too
much
incensed
to
reply
sir
edmund
seized
his
cousin
hand
and
was
leading
her
from
the
room
go
then
go
marry
her
but
first
hear
me
swear
solemnly
swear
and
she
raised
her
hand
and
eyes
to
heaven
that
my
malediction
shall
be
your
portion
speak
but
the
word
and
no
power
shall
make
me
withhold
it
dear
edmund
exclaimed
alicia
distractedly
never
ought
i
to
have
allowed
time
for
the
terrifying
words
that
have
fallen
from
lady
audley
lips
never
for
me
shall
your
mother
malediction
fall
on
you
farewell
for
ever
and
with
the
strength
of
desperation
she
rushed
past
him
and
quitted
the
room
sir
edmund
madly
followed
but
in
vain
alicia
feelings
were
too
highly
wrought
at
that
moment
to
be
touched
even
by
the
man
she
loved
and
without
an
additional
pang
she
saw
him
throw
himself
into
the
carriage
which
he
had
destined
for
so
different
a
purpose
and
quit
for
ever
the
woman
he
adored
it
may
easily
be
conceived
of
how
painful
a
nature
must
have
been
the
future
intercourse
betwixt
lady
audley
and
her
niece
the
former
seemed
to
regard
her
victim
with
that
haughty
distance
which
the
unrelenting
oppressor
never
fails
to
entertain
towards
the
object
of
his
tyranny
while
even
the
gentle
alicia
on
her
part
shrank
with
abhorrence
from
the
presence
of
that
being
whose
stern
decree
had
blasted
all
the
fairest
blossoms
of
her
happiness
alicia
was
received
with
affection
by
her
grandfather
and
she
laboured
to
drive
away
the
heavy
despondency
which
pressed
on
her
spirits
by
studying
his
taste
and
humours
and
striving
to
contribute
to
his
comfort
and
amusement
sir
duncan
had
chosen
the
time
of
alicia
arrival
to
transact
some
business
and
instead
of
returning
immediately
to
the
highlands
he
determined
to
remain
some
weeks
in
edinburgh
for
her
amusement
but
little
attractive
as
dissipation
had
been
it
was
now
absolutely
repugnant
to
alicia
she
loathed
the
idea
of
mixing
in
scenes
of
amusement
with
a
heart
incapable
of
joy
a
spirit
indifferent
to
every
object
that
surrounded
her
and
in
solitude
alone
she
expected
gradually
to
regain
her
peace
of
mind
in
the
amusements
of
the
gay
season
of
edinburgh
alicia
expected
to
find
all
the
vanity
emptiness
and
frivolity
of
london
dissipation
without
its
varied
brilliancy
and
elegant
luxury
yet
so
much
was
it
the
habit
of
her
mind
to
look
to
the
fairest
side
of
things
and
to
extract
some
advantage
from
every
situation
in
which
she
was
placed
that
pensive
and
thoughtful
as
was
her
disposition
the
discriminating
only
perceived
her
deep
dejection
while
all
admired
her
benevolence
of
manner
and
unaffected
desire
to
please
by
degrees
alicia
found
that
in
some
points
she
had
been
inaccurate
in
her
idea
of
the
style
of
living
of
those
who
form
the
best
society
of
edinburgh
the
circle
is
so
confined
that
its
members
are
almost
universally
known
to
each
other
and
those
various
gradations
of
gentility
from
the
city
snug
party
to
the
duchess
most
crowded
assembly
all
totally
distinct
and
separate
which
are
to
be
met
with
in
london
have
no
prototype
in
edinburgh
there
the
ranks
and
fortunes
being
more
on
an
equality
no
one
is
able
greatly
to
exceed
his
neighbour
in
luxury
and
extravagance
great
magnificence
and
the
consequent
gratification
produced
by
the
envy
of
others
being
out
of
the
question
the
object
for
which
a
reunion
of
individuals
was
originally
invented
becomes
less
of
a
secondary
consideration
private
parties
for
the
actual
purpose
of
society
and
conversation
are
frequent
and
answer
the
destined
end
and
in
the
societies
of
professed
amusement
are
to
be
met
the
learned
the
studious
and
the
rational
not
presented
as
shows
to
the
company
by
the
host
and
hostess
but
professedly
seeking
their
own
gratification
still
the
lack
of
beauty
fashion
and
elegance
disappoint
the
stranger
accustomed
to
their
brilliant
combination
in
a
london
world
but
alicia
had
long
since
sickened
in
the
metropolis
at
the
frivolity
of
beauty
the
heartlessness
of
fashion
and
the
insipidity
of
elegance
and
it
was
a
relief
to
her
to
turn
to
the
variety
of
character
she
found
beneath
the
cloak
of
simple
eccentric
and
sometimes
coarse
manners
we
are
never
long
so
totally
abstracted
by
our
own
feelings
as
to
be
unconscious
of
the
attempts
of
others
to
please
us
in
alicia
to
be
conscious
of
it
and
to
be
grateful
was
the
same
movement
yet
she
was
sensible
that
so
many
persons
could
not
in
that
short
period
have
become
seriously
interested
in
her
the
observation
did
not
escape
her
how
much
an
english
stranger
is
looked
up
to
for
fashion
and
taste
in
edinburgh
though
possessing
little
merit
save
that
of
being
english
yet
she
felt
gratified
and
thankful
for
the
kindness
and
attention
that
greeted
her
appearance
on
all
sides
amongst
the
many
who
expressed
goodwill
towards
alicia
there
were
a
few
whose
kindness
and
real
affection
failed
not
to
meet
with
a
return
from
her
and
others
whose
rich
and
varied
powers
of
mind
for
the
first
time
afforded
her
a
true
specimen
of
the
exalting
enjoyment
produced
by
a
communion
of
intellect
she
felt
the
powers
of
her
understanding
enlarge
in
proportion
and
with
this
mental
activity
she
sought
to
solace
the
languor
of
her
heart
and
save
it
from
the
listlessness
of
despair
alicia
had
been
about
six
weeks
in
edinburgh
when
she
received
a
letter
from
lady
audley
no
allusions
were
made
to
the
past
she
wrote
upon
general
topics
in
the
cold
manner
that
might
be
used
to
a
common
acquaintance
and
slightly
named
her
son
as
having
set
out
upon
a
tour
to
the
continent
alicia
heart
was
heavy
as
she
read
the
heartless
letter
of
the
woman
whose
cruelty
ad
not
been
able
to
eradicate
wholly
from
her
breast
he
strong
durable
affection
of
early
habit
sir
duncan
and
alicia
spent
two
months
in
edinburgh
at
the
end
of
which
time
they
went
to
his
country
seat
in
the
adjacent
country
was
picturesque
and
sir
duncan
residence
though
bearing
marks
of
the
absence
of
taste
and
comfort
in
its
arrangements
possessed
much
natural
beauty
two
years
of
tranquil
seclusion
had
passed
over
her
head
when
her
dormant
feeling
were
all
aroused
by
a
letter
from
sir
edmund
it
informed
her
that
he
was
now
of
age
that
his
affection
remained
unalterable
that
he
was
newly
arrived
from
abroad
and
that
notwithstanding
the
she
had
given
to
his
hopes
he
could
not
refrain
on
returning
to
his
native
land
from
assuring
her
that
he
was
resolved
never
to
pay
his
addresses
to
any
other
woman
he
concluded
by
declaring
his
intent
on
of
presenting
himself
at
once
to
sir
duncan
and
soliciting
his
permission
to
claim
her
hand
when
all
scruples
relating
to
lady
audley
must
from
her
change
of
abode
be
at
an
end
alicia
read
the
letter
with
grateful
affection
and
poignant
regret
again
she
shed
he
bitter
tears
of
disappointment
at
the
hard
task
of
refusing
for
a
second
time
so
noble
and
affectionate
a
heart
but
conscience
whispered
that
to
hold
a
passive
line
of
conduct
would
be
in
some
measure
to
deceive
lady
audley
expectations
and
she
felt
with
exquisite
anguish
that
she
had
no
means
to
put
a
final
stop
to
sir
edmund
pursuits
and
to
her
own
trials
but
by
bestowing
her
hand
on
another
the
first
dawning
of
this
idea
was
accompanied
by
the
most
violent
burst
of
anguish
but
far
from
driving
away
the
painful
subject
she
strove
to
render
it
less
appalling
by
dwelling
upon
it
and
labouring
to
reconcile
herself
to
what
seemed
her
only
plan
of
conduct
she
acknowledged
to
herself
that
to
remain
still
single
a
prey
to
sir
edmund
importunities
and
the
continual
temptations
of
her
own
heart
was
for
the
sake
of
present
indulgence
submitting
to
a
fiery
ordeal
from
which
she
could
not
escape
unblamable
without
the
most
repeated
and
agonising
conflicts
three
months
still
remained
for
her
of
peace
and
liberty
after
which
sir
duncan
would
go
to
edinburgh
there
she
would
be
sure
of
meeting
with
the
loved
companion
of
her
youthful
days
and
the
lurking
weakness
of
her
own
breast
would
then
be
seconded
by
the
passionate
eloquence
of
the
being
she
most
loved
and
admired
upon
earth
she
wrote
to
him
repeating
her
former
arguments
declaring
that
she
could
never
feel
herself
absolved
from
the
promise
she
had
given
lady
audley
but
by
that
lady
herself
and
imploring
him
to
abandon
a
pursuit
which
would
be
productive
only
of
lasting
pain
to
both
her
arguments
her
representations
all
failed
in
their
effect
on
sir
edmund
impetuous
character
his
answer
was
short
and
decided
the
purport
of
it
that
he
should
see
her
in
edinburgh
the
moment
she
arrived
there
my
fate
then
is
fixed
thought
alicia
as
she
read
this
letter
i
must
finish
the
sacrifice
the
more
severe
had
been
the
struggle
between
love
and
victorious
duty
the
more
firmly
was
she
determined
to
maintain
this
victory
alicia
resolution
of
marrying
was
now
decided
and
the
opportunity
was
not
wanting
she
had
become
acquainted
during
the
preceding
winter
in
edinburgh
with
major
douglas
eldest
son
of
douglas
of
glenfern
he
had
then
paid
her
the
most
marked
attention
and
since
her
return
to
the
country
had
been
a
frequent
visitor
at
sir
duncan
at
length
he
avowed
his
partiality
which
was
heard
by
sir
duncan
with
pleasure
by
alicia
with
dread
and
submission
yet
she
felt
less
repugnance
towards
him
than
to
any
other
of
her
suitors
he
was
pleasing
in
his
person
quiet
and
simple
in
his
manners
and
his
character
stood
high
for
integrity
good
temper
and
plain
sense
the
sequel
requires
little
further
detail
alicia
malcolm
became
the
wife
of
archibald
douglas
an
eternal
constancy
is
a
thing
so
rare
to
be
met
with
that
persons
who
desire
that
sort
of
reputation
strive
to
obtain
it
by
nourishing
the
ideas
that
recall
the
passion
even
though
guilt
and
sorrow
should
go
hand
in
hand
with
it
but
alicia
far
from
piquing
herself
in
the
lovelorn
pensiveness
she
might
have
assumed
had
she
yielded
to
the
impulse
of
her
feelings
diligently
strove
not
only
to
make
up
her
mind
to
the
lot
which
had
devolved
to
her
but
to
bring
it
to
such
a
frame
of
cheerfulness
as
should
enable
her
to
contribute
to
her
happiness
when
the
soul
is
no
longer
buffeted
by
the
storms
of
hope
or
fear
when
all
is
fixed
unchangeably
for
life
sorrow
for
the
past
will
never
long
prey
on
a
pious
and
mind
if
alicia
lost
the
buoyant
spirit
of
youth
the
bright
and
quick
play
of
fancy
yet
a
placid
contentment
crowned
her
days
and
at
the
end
of
two
years
she
would
have
been
astonished
had
anyone
marked
her
as
an
object
of
compassion
she
scarcely
ever
heard
from
lady
audley
and
in
the
few
letters
her
aunt
had
favoured
her
with
she
gave
favourable
though
vague
accounts
of
her
son
alicia
did
not
court
a
more
unreserved
communication
and
had
long
since
taught
herself
to
hope
that
he
was
now
happy
soon
after
their
marriage
major
douglas
quitted
the
army
upon
succeeding
to
a
small
estate
on
the
banks
of
lochmarlie
by
the
death
of
an
uncle
and
there
in
the
calm
seclusion
of
domestic
life
douglas
found
that
peace
which
might
have
been
denied
her
amid
gayer
scenes
chapter
xiv
and
joyous
was
the
scene
in
early
summer
madoc
on
henry
return
from
his
solitary
ramble
douglas
learnt
from
him
the
cause
of
the
misunderstanding
that
had
taken
place
and
judging
that
in
the
present
state
of
affairs
a
temporary
separation
might
be
of
use
to
both
parties
as
they
were
now
about
to
return
home
she
proposed
to
her
husband
to
invite
his
brother
and
lady
juliana
to
follow
and
spend
a
few
weeks
with
them
at
lochmarlie
cottage
the
invitation
was
eagerly
accepted
for
though
lady
juliana
did
not
anticipate
any
positive
pleasure
from
the
change
still
she
thought
that
every
place
must
be
more
agreeable
than
her
present
abode
especially
as
she
stipulated
for
the
utter
exclusion
of
the
aunts
from
the
party
to
atone
for
this
mortification
miss
becky
was
invited
to
fill
the
vacant
seat
in
the
carriage
and
accordingly
with
a
cargo
of
strong
shoes
greatcoats
and
a
large
well
stuffed
with
she
took
her
place
at
the
appointed
hour
the
day
they
had
chosen
for
their
expedition
was
one
that
sent
a
summer
feeling
to
the
heart
the
air
was
soft
and
genial
not
a
cloud
stained
the
bright
azure
of
the
heavens
and
the
sun
shone
out
in
all
his
splendour
shedding
life
and
beauty
even
over
all
the
desolate
hills
of
glenfern
but
after
they
had
journeyed
a
few
miles
suddenly
emerging
from
the
valley
a
scene
of
matchless
beauty
burst
at
once
upon
the
eye
before
them
lay
the
waters
of
lochmarlie
reflecting
as
in
a
mirror
every
surrounding
object
and
bearing
on
its
placid
transparent
bosom
a
fleet
of
the
drapery
of
whose
black
suspended
nets
contrasted
with
picturesque
effect
the
white
sails
of
the
larger
vessels
which
were
vainly
spread
to
catch
a
breeze
all
around
rocks
meadows
woods
and
hills
mingled
in
wild
and
lovely
irregularity
on
a
projecting
point
of
land
stood
a
little
fishing
village
its
white
cottages
reflected
in
the
glassy
waters
that
almost
surrounded
it
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
lake
or
rather
estuary
embosomed
in
wood
rose
the
lofty
turrets
of
lochmarlie
castle
while
here
and
there
perched
on
some
mountain
brow
were
to
be
seen
the
shepherd
lonely
hut
and
the
summer
shealing
not
a
breath
was
stirring
not
a
sound
was
heard
save
the
rushing
of
a
waterfall
the
tinkling
of
some
silver
rivulet
or
the
calm
rippling
of
the
tranquil
lake
now
and
then
at
intervals
the
fisherman
gaelic
ditty
chanted
as
he
lay
stretched
on
the
sand
in
some
sunny
nook
or
the
shrill
distant
sound
of
childish
glee
how
delicious
to
the
feeling
heart
to
behold
so
fair
a
scene
of
unsophisticated
nature
and
to
listen
to
her
voice
alone
breathing
the
accents
of
innocence
and
joy
but
none
of
the
party
who
now
gazed
on
it
had
minds
capable
of
being
touched
with
the
emotions
it
was
calculated
to
inspire
henry
indeed
was
rapturous
in
his
expressions
of
admiration
but
he
concluded
his
panegyrics
by
wondering
his
brother
did
not
keep
a
cutter
and
resolving
to
pass
a
night
on
board
one
of
the
herring
boats
that
he
might
eat
the
fish
in
perfection
lady
juliana
thought
it
might
be
very
pretty
if
instead
of
those
frightful
rocks
and
shabby
cottages
there
could
be
villas
and
gardens
and
lawns
and
conservatories
and
and
statues
miss
becky
observed
if
it
was
hers
she
would
cut
down
the
woods
and
level
the
hills
and
have
races
the
road
wound
along
the
sides
of
the
lake
sometimes
overhung
with
banks
of
natural
wood
which
though
scarcely
budding
grew
so
thick
as
to
exclude
the
prospect
in
other
places
surmounted
by
large
masses
of
rock
festooned
with
ivy
and
embroidered
by
mosses
of
a
thousand
hues
that
glittered
under
the
little
mountain
streamlets
two
miles
farther
on
stood
the
simple
mansion
of
douglas
it
was
situated
in
a
wild
sequestered
nook
formed
by
a
little
bay
at
the
farther
end
of
the
lake
on
three
sides
it
was
surrounded
by
wooded
hills
that
offered
a
complete
shelter
from
every
nipping
blast
to
the
south
the
lawn
sprinkled
with
trees
and
shrubs
sloped
gradually
down
to
the
water
at
the
door
they
were
met
by
douglas
who
welcomed
them
with
the
most
affectionate
cordiality
and
conducted
them
into
the
house
through
a
little
circular
hall
filled
with
flowering
shrubs
and
foreign
plants
how
delightful
exclaimed
lady
juliana
as
she
stopped
to
inhale
the
rich
fragrance
moss
roses
i
do
delight
in
them
twisting
off
a
rich
cluster
of
flowers
and
buds
in
token
of
her
affection
and
i
quite
doat
upon
heliotrope
gathering
a
handful
of
flowers
as
she
spoke
then
extending
her
hand
towards
a
most
luxuriant
cape
jessamine
i
must
really
petition
you
to
spare
this
my
favourite
child
said
her
as
she
gently
withheld
her
arm
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
dear
lady
juliana
you
have
already
infringed
the
rules
of
my
little
conservatory
which
admit
only
of
the
gratification
of
two
senses
seeing
and
smelling
what
do
you
like
your
flowers
to
be
gathered
exclaimed
lady
juliana
in
a
tone
of
surprise
and
disappointment
i
do
know
any
other
use
they
of
what
quantities
i
used
to
have
from
hothouses
douglas
made
no
reply
but
conducted
her
to
the
where
her
chagrin
was
dispelled
by
the
appearance
of
comfort
and
even
elegance
that
it
bore
now
this
is
really
what
i
like
cried
she
throwing
herself
on
one
of
the
couches
a
large
fire
open
windows
quantities
of
roses
comfortable
ottomans
and
pictures
only
what
a
pity
you
have
a
larger
mirror
douglas
now
rang
for
refreshments
and
apologised
for
the
absence
of
her
husband
who
she
said
was
so
much
interested
in
his
ploughing
that
he
seldom
made
his
appearance
till
sent
for
henry
then
proposed
that
they
should
all
go
out
and
surprise
his
brother
and
though
walking
in
the
country
formed
no
part
of
lady
juliana
amusements
yet
as
douglas
assured
her
the
walks
were
perfectly
dry
and
her
husband
was
so
pressing
she
consented
the
way
lay
through
a
shrubbery
by
the
side
of
a
brawling
brook
whose
banks
retained
all
the
wildness
of
unadorned
nature
moss
and
ivy
and
fern
clothed
the
ground
and
under
the
banks
the
young
primroses
and
violets
began
to
raise
their
heads
while
the
red
wintry
berry
still
hung
thick
on
the
hollies
this
is
really
very
pleasant
said
henry
stopping
to
contemplate
a
view
of
the
lake
through
the
branches
of
a
weeping
birch
the
sound
of
the
stream
and
the
singing
of
the
birds
and
all
those
wild
flowers
make
it
appear
as
if
it
was
summer
in
this
spot
and
only
look
julia
how
pretty
that
wherry
looks
lying
at
anchor
then
whispering
to
her
what
would
you
think
of
such
a
desert
as
this
with
the
man
of
your
heart
lady
juliana
made
no
reply
but
by
complaining
of
the
heat
of
the
sun
the
hardness
of
the
gravel
and
the
damp
from
the
water
henry
who
now
began
to
look
upon
the
condition
of
a
highland
farmer
with
more
complacency
than
formerly
was
confirmed
in
his
favourable
sentiments
at
sight
of
his
brother
following
the
primitive
occupation
of
the
plough
his
fine
face
glowing
with
health
and
lighted
up
with
good
humour
and
happiness
he
hastily
advanced
towards
the
party
and
shaking
his
brother
and
most
warmly
by
the
hand
expressed
with
all
the
warmth
of
a
good
heart
the
pleasure
he
had
in
receiving
them
at
his
house
then
observing
lady
juliana
languid
air
and
imputing
to
fatigue
of
body
what
in
fact
was
the
consequence
of
mental
vacuity
he
proposed
returning
home
by
a
shorter
road
than
that
by
which
they
had
come
henry
was
again
in
raptures
at
the
new
beauties
this
walk
presented
and
at
the
high
order
and
neatness
in
which
the
grounds
were
kept
this
must
be
a
very
expensive
place
of
yours
though
said
he
addressing
his
there
is
so
much
garden
and
shrubbery
and
such
a
number
of
rustic
bridges
bowers
and
so
forth
it
must
require
half
a
dozen
men
to
keep
it
in
any
order
such
an
establishment
would
very
ill
accord
with
our
moderate
means
replied
she
we
do
not
pretend
to
one
regular
gardener
and
had
our
little
embellishments
been
productive
of
much
expense
or
tending
solely
to
my
gratification
i
should
never
have
suggested
them
when
we
first
took
possession
of
this
spot
it
was
a
perfect
wilderness
with
a
dirty
on
it
nothing
but
mud
about
the
doors
nothing
but
wood
and
briers
and
brambles
beyond
it
and
the
village
presented
a
still
more
melancholy
scene
of
rank
luxuriance
in
its
swarms
of
dirty
idle
girls
and
mischievous
boys
i
have
generally
found
that
wherever
an
evil
exists
the
remedy
is
not
far
off
and
in
this
case
it
was
strikingly
obvious
it
was
only
engaging
these
children
by
trifling
rewards
to
apply
their
lively
energies
in
improving
instead
of
destroying
the
works
of
nature
as
had
formerly
been
their
zealous
practice
in
a
short
time
the
change
on
the
moral
as
well
as
the
vegetable
part
of
creation
became
very
perceptible
the
children
grew
industrious
and
peaceable
and
instead
of
destroying
trees
robbing
nests
and
worrying
cats
the
bigger
boys
under
douglas
direction
constructed
these
wooden
bridges
and
seats
or
cut
out
and
gravelled
the
little
winding
paths
that
we
had
previously
marked
out
the
task
of
keeping
everything
n
order
is
now
easy
as
you
may
believe
when
i
tell
you
the
whole
of
our
as
you
are
pleased
to
term
them
receive
no
other
attention
than
what
is
bestowed
by
children
under
twelve
years
of
age
and
now
having
i
hope
acquitted
myself
of
the
charge
of
extravagance
i
ought
to
beg
lady
juliana
pardon
for
this
long
and
i
fear
tiresome
detail
having
now
reached
the
house
douglas
conducted
her
guest
to
the
apartment
prepared
for
her
while
the
brothers
pursued
their
walk
as
long
as
novelty
retained
its
power
and
the
comparison
between
glenfern
and
lochmarlie
was
fresh
in
remembrance
lady
juliana
charmed
with
everything
was
in
high
but
as
the
horrors
of
the
one
were
forgotten
and
the
comforts
of
the
other
became
familiar
the
demon
of
ennui
again
took
possession
of
her
vacant
mind
and
she
relapsed
into
all
her
capricious
humours
and
childish
impertinences
the
harpsichord
which
on
her
first
arrival
she
had
pronounced
to
be
excellent
was
now
declared
quite
shocking
so
much
out
of
tune
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
playing
upon
it
the
small
collection
of
novels
she
soon
exhausted
and
then
they
became
the
stupidest
books
she
had
ever
read
the
smell
of
the
heliotrope
now
gave
her
the
headache
the
sight
of
the
lake
made
her
douglas
heard
all
these
civilities
in
silence
and
much
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
in
the
wayward
inclinations
variable
temper
and
wretched
inanity
of
this
poor
victim
of
indulgence
she
beheld
the
sad
fruits
of
a
fashionable
education
and
thought
with
humility
that
under
similar
circumstances
such
might
have
been
her
own
character
oh
what
an
awful
responsibility
do
those
parents
incur
she
would
mentally
exclaim
who
thus
neglect
or
corrupt
the
noble
deposit
of
an
immortal
soul
and
who
alas
can
tell
where
the
mischief
may
end
this
unfortunate
will
herself
become
a
mother
yet
wholly
ignorant
of
the
duties
incapable
of
the
of
that
sacred
office
she
will
bring
into
the
world
creatures
to
whom
she
can
only
transmit
her
errors
and
her
weaknesses
these
reflections
at
times
deeply
affected
the
generous
heart
and
truly
christian
spirit
of
douglas
and
she
sought
by
every
means
in
her
power
to
restrain
those
faults
which
she
knew
it
would
be
vain
to
attempt
eradicating
to
diversify
the
routine
of
days
which
grew
more
and
more
tedious
to
lady
juliana
the
weather
being
remarkably
fine
many
little
excursions
were
made
to
the
nearest
country
seats
which
though
they
did
not
afford
her
any
actual
pleasure
answered
the
purpose
of
consuming
a
considerable
portion
of
her
time
several
weeks
passed
away
during
which
little
inclination
was
shown
on
the
part
of
the
guests
to
quit
their
present
residence
when
and
douglas
were
summoned
to
attend
the
of
sir
duncan
malcolm
and
though
they
pressed
their
guests
to
remain
during
their
absence
yet
henry
felt
it
would
be
highly
offensive
to
his
father
were
they
to
do
so
and
therefore
resolved
immediately
to
return
to
glenfern
chapter
xv
they
steeked
doors
they
steeked
yetts
close
to
the
cheek
and
chin
they
steeked
them
a
but
a
little
wicket
and
lammikin
crap
in
now
quhere
the
lady
of
this
castle
the
party
were
received
with
the
loudest
acclamations
of
joy
by
the
good
old
ladies
and
even
the
laird
seemed
to
have
forgotten
that
his
son
had
refused
to
breed
black
cattle
and
that
his
was
above
the
management
of
her
household
the
usual
salutations
were
scarcely
over
when
miss
grizzy
flying
to
her
little
pulled
out
a
letter
and
with
an
air
of
importance
having
enjoined
silence
she
read
as
follows
locmarlie
castle
dear
sampson
stomach
has
been
as
bad
as
it
could
well
be
but
not
so
bad
as
your
roads
he
was
shook
to
a
jelly
my
petticoat
will
never
do
has
had
a
girl
i
wonder
what
makes
people
have
girls
they
never
come
to
good
boys
may
go
to
the
mischief
and
be
good
for
something
if
girls
go
they
good
for
nothing
i
know
of
i
never
saw
such
roads
i
suppose
glenfern
means
to
bury
you
all
in
the
highway
there
are
holes
enough
to
make
you
graves
and
stones
big
enough
for
coffins
you
must
all
come
and
spend
tuesday
here
not
all
but
some
of
you
you
dear
child
and
your
brother
and
a
sister
and
your
pretty
niece
and
handsome
nephew
i
love
handsome
people
miss
has
bounced
away
with
her
father
footman
i
hope
he
will
clean
his
knives
on
her
come
early
and
come
dressed
to
your
loving
friend
isabella
maclaughlan
the
letter
ended
a
volley
of
applause
ensued
which
at
length
gave
place
to
consultation
of
course
we
all
go
at
least
as
many
as
the
carriage
will
hold
we
have
no
engagements
and
there
can
be
no
objections
lady
juliana
had
already
frowned
a
contemptuous
refusal
but
in
due
time
it
was
changed
to
a
sullen
assent
at
the
pressing
entreaties
of
her
husband
to
whom
any
place
was
now
preferable
to
home
in
truth
the
mention
of
a
party
had
more
weight
with
her
than
either
her
wishes
or
her
aunts
remonstrances
and
they
had
assured
her
that
she
should
meet
with
a
large
assemblage
of
the
very
first
company
at
lochmarlie
castle
the
day
appointed
for
the
important
visit
arrived
and
it
was
arranged
that
two
of
the
elder
ladies
and
one
of
the
young
ones
should
accompany
lady
juliana
in
her
barouche
which
henry
was
to
drive
at
peep
of
dawn
the
ladies
were
astir
and
at
eight
breakfast
was
hurried
over
that
they
might
begin
the
preparations
necessary
for
appearing
with
dignity
at
the
shrine
of
this
their
patron
saint
at
eleven
they
reappeared
in
all
the
majesty
of
sweeping
silk
trains
and
toupees
in
outward
show
miss
becky
was
not
less
elaborate
the
united
strength
and
skill
of
her
three
aunts
and
four
sisters
had
evidently
been
exerted
in
forcing
her
hair
into
every
position
but
that
for
which
nature
had
intended
it
curls
stood
on
end
around
her
forehead
and
tresses
were
dragged
up
from
the
roots
and
formed
into
a
club
on
the
crown
her
arms
had
been
strapped
back
till
her
elbows
met
by
means
of
a
pink
ribbon
of
no
ordinary
strength
or
doubtful
hue
three
hours
were
past
in
all
the
anguish
of
impatience
an
anguish
in
which
every
female
breast
must
be
ready
to
sympathise
but
lady
juliana
sympathised
in
no
one
distresses
but
her
own
and
the
difference
of
waiting
in
high
dress
or
in
déshabille
was
a
distinction
to
her
inconceivable
but
those
to
whom
be
dressed
an
event
will
readily
enter
into
the
feelings
of
the
ladies
in
question
as
they
sat
walked
wondered
exclaimed
opened
windows
wrung
their
hands
adjusted
their
dress
etc
during
the
three
tedious
hours
they
were
doomed
to
wait
the
appearance
of
their
niece
two
came
and
with
it
lady
juliana
as
if
purposely
to
testify
her
contempt
in
a
loose
morning
dress
and
mob
cap
the
sisters
looked
blank
with
disappointment
for
having
made
themselves
mistresses
of
the
contents
of
her
ladyship
wardrobe
they
had
settled
amongst
themselves
that
the
most
suitable
dress
for
the
occasion
would
be
black
velvet
and
accordingly
many
hints
had
been
given
the
preceding
evening
on
the
virtues
of
black
velvet
gowns
they
were
warm
and
not
too
warm
they
were
dressy
and
not
too
dressy
lady
maclaughlan
was
a
great
admirer
of
black
velvet
gowns
she
had
one
herself
with
long
sleeves
and
that
buttoned
behind
black
velvet
gowns
were
very
much
wore
they
knew
several
ladies
who
had
them
and
they
were
certain
there
would
be
nothing
else
wore
amongst
the
matrons
at
lady
maclaughlan
etc
etc
time
was
however
too
precious
to
be
given
either
to
remonstrance
or
lamentation
miss
jacky
could
only
give
an
angry
look
and
miss
grizzy
a
sorrowful
one
as
they
hurried
away
to
the
carriage
uttering
exclamations
of
despair
at
the
lateness
of
the
hour
and
the
impossibility
that
anybody
could
have
time
to
dress
after
getting
to
lochmarlie
castle
the
consequence
of
the
delay
was
that
it
was
dark
by
the
time
they
reached
the
place
of
destination
the
carriage
drove
up
to
the
grand
entrance
but
neither
lights
nor
servants
greeted
their
arrival
and
no
answer
was
returned
to
the
ringing
of
the
bell
we
had
best
get
out
and
try
the
back
this
is
most
alarming
i
declare
cried
miss
grizzy
it
is
quite
incomprehensible
observed
miss
jacky
we
had
best
get
out
and
try
the
back
door
the
party
alighted
and
another
attack
being
made
upon
the
rear
it
met
with
better
success
for
a
little
boy
now
presented
himself
at
a
narrow
opening
of
the
door
and
in
a
strong
highland
accent
demanded
wha
ta
war
seekin
lady
maclaughlan
to
be
sure
colin
was
the
reply
weel
weel
still
refusing
admittance
but
te
leddie
no
to
be
spoken
wi
not
to
be
spoken
with
exclaimed
miss
grizzy
almost
sinking
to
the
ground
with
apprehension
good
gracious
i
i
hope
i
i
declare
i
sir
sampson
oo
ay
hur
may
see
lochmarlie
hursel
then
opening
the
door
he
led
the
way
and
ushered
them
into
the
presence
of
sir
sampson
who
was
reclining
in
an
easy
chair
arrayed
in
a
de
and
nightcap
the
opening
of
the
door
seemed
to
have
broken
his
slumber
for
gazing
around
with
a
look
of
stupefaction
he
demanded
in
a
sleepy
peevish
tone
who
was
there
bless
me
sir
sampson
exclaimed
both
spinsters
at
once
darting
forward
and
seizing
a
hand
bless
me
do
you
know
us
and
here
is
our
niece
lady
juliana
my
lady
juliana
douglas
cried
he
with
a
shriek
of
horror
sinking
again
upon
his
cushions
i
am
betrayed
i
where
is
my
lady
maclaughlan
where
is
philistine
where
is
the
devil
this
is
not
to
be
borne
my
lady
juliana
douglas
the
earl
of
courtland
daughter
to
be
introduced
to
lochmarlie
castle
in
so
vile
a
manner
and
myself
surprised
in
so
indecorous
a
situation
and
his
lips
quivering
with
passion
he
rang
the
bell
the
summons
was
answered
by
the
same
attendant
that
had
acted
as
gentleman
usher
are
all
my
people
demanded
his
incensed
master
hurs
aw
awa
tull

my
lady
hurs
i
ta
teach
tap
house

oh
we
all
go
upstairs
and
see
what
lady
maclaughlan
and
philistine
are
about
in
the
laboratory
said
miss
grizzy
so
pray
just
go
on
with
your
nap
sir
sampson
we
shall
find
the
way
do
stir
and
taking
lady
juliana
by
the
hand
away
tripped
the
spinsters
in
search
of
their
friend
i
can
not
conceive
the
meaning
of
all
this
whispered
miss
grizzy
to
her
sister
as
they
went
along
something
must
be
wrong
but
i
said
nothing
to
dear
sir
sampson
his
nerves
are
so
easily
agitated
but
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
all
this
i
declare
it
quite
a
mystery
after
ascending
several
long
dark
stairs
and
following
divers
windings
and
turnings
the
party
at
length
reached
the
door
of
the
sanctorum
and
having
gently
tapped
the
voice
of
the
priestess
was
heard
in
no
very
encouraging
accents
demanding
who
was
there
it
only
us
replied
her
trembling
friend
only
us
humph
i
wonder
what
fool
is
called
us
open
the
door
philistine
and
see
what
wants
the
door
was
opened
and
the
party
entered
the
day
was
closing
in
but
by
the
faint
twilight
that
mingled
with
the
gleams
from
a
smoky
smouldering
fire
lady
maclaughlan
was
dimly
discernible
as
she
stood
upon
the
hearth
watching
the
contents
of
an
enormous
kettle
that
emitted
both
steam
and
odour
she
regarded
the
invaders
with
her
usual
marble
aspect
and
without
moving
either
joint
or
muscle
as
they
drew
near
i
declare
i
do
think
you
know
us
lady
maclaughlan
said
miss
grizzy
in
a
tone
of
affected
vivacity
with
which
she
strove
to
conceal
her
agitation
know
you
repeated
her
friend
humph
who
you
are
i
know
very
well
but
what
brings
you
here
i
do
know
do
you
know
yourselves
i
declare
ca
conceive
began
miss
grizzy
but
her
trepidation
arrested
her
speech
and
her
sister
therefore
proceeded
your
ladyship
declaration
is
no
less
astonishing
than
incomprehensible
we
have
waited
upon
you
by
your
own
express
invitation
on
the
day
appointed
by
yourself
and
we
have
been
received
in
a
manner
i
must
say
we
did
not
expect
considering
this
is
the
first
visit
of
our
niece
lady
juliana
douglas
i
tell
you
what
girls
replied
their
friend
as
she
still
stood
with
her
back
to
the
fire
and
her
hands
behind
her
i
tell
you
what
you
are
not
yourselves
you
are
all
lost
quite
mad
all
humph
if
that
the
case
we
can
not
be
fit
company
for
your
ladyship
retorted
miss
jacky
warmly
and
therefore
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
return
the
way
we
came
come
lady
juliana
come
sister
i
declare
jacky
the
impetuosity
of
your
temper
is
i
really
can
not
stand
it
and
the
gentle
grizzy
gave
way
to
a
flood
of
tears
you
used
to
be
rational
intelligent
creatures
resumed
her
ladyship
but
what
has
come
over
you
i
do
know
you
come
tumbling
in
here
at
the
middle
of
the
night
and
at
the
top
of
the
house
nobody
knows
how
when
i
never
was
thinking
of
you
and
because
i
do
tell
a
parcel
of
lies
and
pretend
i
expected
you
you
are
for
flying
off
again
humph
is
this
the
behaviour
of
women
in
their
senses
but
since
you
are
here
you
may
as
well
sit
down
and
say
what
brought
you
get
down
gil
blas
go
along
tom
jones
addressing
two
huge
cats
who
occupied
a
leather
chair
by
the
fireside
and
who
relinquished
it
with
much
reluctance
how
do
you
do
pretty
creature
kissing
lady
juliana
as
she
seated
her
in
this
cat
cradle
now
girls
sit
down
and
tell
what
brought
you
here
humph
can
your
ladyship
ask
such
a
question
after
having
formally
invited
us
demanded
the
wrathful
jacky
i
tell
you
what
girls
you
were
just
as
much
invited
by
me
to
dine
here
as
you
were
appointed
to
sup
with
the
grand
seignior
humph
what
day
of
the
week
does
your
ladyship
call
this
i
call
it
tuesday
but
i
suppose
the
glenfern
calendar
calls
it
thursday
thursday
was
the
day
i
invited
you
to
come
i
sure
i
thankful
we
got
to
the
bottom
of
it
at
last
cried
miss
grizzy
i
read
it
because
i
sure
you
wrote
it
tuesday
how
could
you
be
such
a
fool
my
love
as
to
read
it
any
such
thing
even
if
it

tuesday
you
might
have
had
the
sense
to
know
it
meant
thursday
when
did
you
know
me
invite
anybody
for
a
tuesday
i
declare
it
very
true
i
certainly
ought
to
have
known
better
i
am
quite
confounded
at
my
own
stupidity
for
as
you
observe
even
though
you
had
said
tuesday
i
might
have
known
that
you
must
have
meant
thursday
well
well
no
more
about
it
since
you
are
here
you
must
stay
here
and
you
must
have
something
to
eat
i
suppose
sir
sampson
and
i
have
dined
two
hours
ago
but
you
shall
have
your
dinner
for
all
that
i
must
shut
shop
for
this
day
it
seems
and
leave
my
resuscitating
tincture
all
in
the

pills
quite
in

infancy
but
there
no
help
for
it
since
you
are
here
you
must
stay
here
and
you
must
be
fed
and
lodged

on
returning
to
the
parlour
they
found
sir
sampson
had
by
means
of
the
indefatigable
philistine
been
transported
into
a
suit
of
regimentals

which

in
some
measure
restored
him
to
his
usual
complacency
henry
who
had
gone
in
quest
of
some
person
to
take
charge
of
the
horses
now
entered
and
shortly
after
a
tray
of
provisions
was
brought
which
the
party
eagerly
attacked
regardless
of
their
hostess
admonitions
to
eat
sparingly
as
nothing
was
so
dangerous
as
eating
heartily
when
people
were
hungry
the
repast
being
at
length
concluded
lady
maclaughlan
led
her
guests
into
the
saloon
they
passed
through
an
antechamber
which
seemed
by
the
faint
light
of
the
lamp
to
contain
nothing
but
piles
on
piles
of
china
and
entered
the
room
of
state
the
eye
at
first
wandered
in
uncertain
obscurity
and
the
guests
cautiously
proceeded
over
a
bare
oaken
floor
whose
dark
polished
surface
seemed
to
emulate
a
mirror
through
an
apartment
of
formidable
extent
the
walls
were
hung
with
rich
but
grotesque
tapestry
the
ceiling
by
its
height
and
massy
carving
bespoke
the
age
of
the
apartment
but
the
beauty
of
the
design
was
lost
in
the
gloom
a
turkey
carpet
was
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
on
the
middle
of
the
carpet
stood
the
card
table
at
which
two
footmen
hastily
summoned
from
the
revels
at
sandy
more
were
placing
chairs
and
cards
seemingly
eager
to
display
themselves
as
if
to
prove
that
they
were
always
at
their
posts
cards
were
a
matter
of
course
with
sir

and
his
lady

as
whist
was
the
only
game
they
ever
played
a

arose

said

taking
one
of
the
candles
she
made
a
journey
to
the
other
end

the

and
entered
a
small
turret

the

miss

was
settled
with
her
hands
across
and
the
whist
party
being
arranged
a
solemn
silence
ensued
lady
juliana
turned
over
a
few
pages
of
her
own
book
then
begged
henry
would
exchange
with
her
but
both
were
in
so
different
a
style
from
the
french
and
german
school
she
had
been
accustomed
to
that
they
were
soon
relinquished
in
disappointment
and
disgust
on
the
table
which
had
been
placed
by
the
fire
for
her
accommodation
lay
an
english
newspaper
and
to
that
she
had
recourse
as
a
last
effort
at
amusement
but
alas
even
the
dulness
of
clarissa
harlowe
was
delight
compared
to
the
anguish
with
which
this
fatal
paper
was
fraught
in
the
shape
of
the
following
paragraph
which
presented
itself
to

unfortunate

this
occasion
and
was
present
in
person
as
were
their
royal
highnesses
the
dukes
of
and
of
the
bride
looked
most
bewitchingly
lovely
in
a
simple
robe
of
the
finest
mechlin
lace
with
a
superb
veil
of
the
same
costly
material
which
hung
down
to
her
feet
she
wore
a
set
of
pearls
estimated
at
thirty
thousand
pounds
whose
chaste
elegance
corresponded
with
the
rest
of
the
dress
immediately
after
the
ceremony
they
partook
of
a
sumptuous
collation
and
the
happy
pair
set
off
in
a
chariot
and

attended
by

outriders
and

at

than
half
a

wretched
as
lady
juliana
had
long
felt
herself
to
be
her
former
state
of
mind
was
positive
happiness
compared
to
what
she
now
endured
envy
regret
and
resentment
all
struggled
in
the
breast
of
the
beauty
while
the
paper
dropped
from
her
hand
and
she
cast
a
fearful
glance
around
as
if
to
ascertain
the
reality
of
her
fate
the
dreadful
certainty
smote
her
with
a
sense
of
wretchedness
too
acute
to
be
suppressed
and
darting
a
look
of
horror
at
her
unconscious
husband
she
threw
herself
back
in
her
chair
while
the
scalding
tears
of
envy
anger
and
repentance
fell
from
her
eyes
accustomed
as
henry
now
was
to
these
ebullitions
of
from
his
beauteous
partner
he
was
not
yet
so
indifferent
as
to
behold
them
unmoved
and
he
sought
to
soothe
her
by
the
kindest
expressions
and
most
tender
epithets
these
indeed
had
long
since
ceased
to
charm
away
the
lady
but
they
sometimes
succeeded
in
mollifying
it
but
now
their
only
effect
seemed
to
be
increasing
the
irritation
as
she
turned
from
all
her
husband
inquiries
and
impatiently
withdrew
her
hands
from
his
astonished
at
a
conduct
so
incomprehensible
douglas
earnestly
besought
an
explanation
there
cried
she
at
length
pushing
the
paper
towards
him
see
there
what
i
might
have
been
but
for
you
and
then
compare
it
with
what
you
have
made
me
confounded
by
this
reproach
henry
eagerly
snatched
up
the
paper
and
his
eye
instantly
fell
on
the
fatal
paragraph
the
poisoned
dart
that
struck
the
to
all
that
now
remained
to
him
of
happiness
the
fond
idea
that
even
amidst
childish
folly
and
capricious
estrangement
still
in
the
main
he
was
beloved
with
a
quivering
lip
and
cheek
blanched
with
mortification
and
indignant
contempt
he
laid
down
the
paper
and
without
casting
a
look
upon
or
uttering
a
word
to
his
once
and
adoring
juliana
quitted
the
apartment
in
all
that
bitterness
of
spirit
which
a
generous
nature
must
feel
when
it
first
discovers
the
fallacy
of
a
cherished
affection
henry
had
indeed
ceased
to
regard
his
wife
with
the
ardour
of
romantic
passion
nor
had
the
solid
feelings
of
affectionate
esteem
supplied
its
place
but
he
loved
her
still
because
he
believed
himself
the
engrossing
object
of
her
tenderness
and
in
that
blest
delusion
he
had
hitherto
found
palliatives
for
her
folly
and
consolation
for
all
his
own
distresses
to
indifference
he
might
for
a
time
have
remained
insensible
because
though
his
feelings
were
strong
his
perceptions
were
not
acute
but
the
veil
of
illusion
was
now
rudely
withdrawn
he
beheld
himself
detested
where
he
imagined
himself
adored
and
the
anguish
of
disappointed
affection
was
heightened
by
the
stings
of
wounded
pride
and
deluded

lady
the
distance
at
which
the

party
had
placed
themselves
and
the
deep
interest
in
which
their
senses
were
involved
while
the
fate
of
the
odd
trick
was
pending
had
rendered
them
insensible
to
the
scene
that
was
acting
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
apartment
the
task
of
administering
succour
to
the
afflicted
fair
one
therefore
devolved
upon
miss
becky
whose
sympathetic
powers
never
had
been
called
into
action
before
slowly
approaching
the
wretched
lady
juliana
as
she
lay
back
in
her
chair
the
tears
coursing
each
other
down
her
cheeks
she
tendered
her
a
to
which
her
own
nose
and
the
noses
of
her
sisters
were
wont
to
be
applied
whenever
as
they
choicely
expressed
it
they
wanted
a
fine
smell
but
upon
this
trying
occasion
she
went
still
farther
she
unscrewed
the
stopper
unfolded
a
cotton
handkerchief
upon
which
she
poured
a
few
drops
of
lavender
water
and
offered
it
to
her
ladyship
deeming
that
the
most
elegant
and
efficient
manner
in
which
she
could
afford
relief
but
the
offering
was
silently
waved
off
and
poor
miss
becky
having
done
all
that
the
light
of
reason
suggested
to
her
retreated
to
her
seat
wondering
what
it
was

the

the

was

her
ladyship
fears
of
lady
maclaughlan
had
enabled
her
to
conquer
her
feelings
so
far
that
they
had
now
sunk
into
a
state
of
sullen
dejection
which
the
good
aunts
eagerly
interpreted
into
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
miss
grizzy
declaring
that
although
the
drive
was
most
delightful
nobody
could
deny
that
and
they
all
enjoyed
it
excessively
as
indeed
everybody
must
who
had
eyes
in
their
head
yet
she
must
own
at
the
same
time
that
she
really
felt
as
if
all
her
bones
were
broke
a
general
rising
therefore
took
place
at
an
early
hour
and
lady
juliana
attended
by
all
the
females
of
the
party
was
ushered
into
the
chamber
of
state
which
was
fitted
up
in
a
style
acknowledged
to
be
truly
magnificent
by
all
who
had
ever
enjoyed
the
honour
of
being
permitted
to
gaze
on
its
white
velvet
bed
curtains
surmounted
by
the
family
arms
and
gracefully
tucked
up
by
hands
the
wrists
etc
but
lest
my
fashionable
readers
should
be
of
a
different
opinion
i
shall
refrain
from
giving
an
inventory
of
the
various
articles
with
which
this
favoured
chamber
was
furnished
misses
grizzy
and
jacky
occupied
the
green
room
which
had
been
fitted
up
at
sir
sampson
birth
the
curtains
hung
at
a
respectful
distance
from
the
ground
the
was
far
beyond
the
reach
even
of
the
majestic
jacky
arm
and
the
painted
tiffany
toilet
was
covered
with
a
shoal
of
little
boxes
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
a
grim
visage
scowling
from
under
a
highland
bonnet
graced
by
a
single
black
feather
hung
on
high
miss
grizzy
placed
herself
before
it
and
holding
up
the
candle
contemplated
it
for
about
the
nine
hundredth
time
with
an
awe
bordering
almost
on
adoration
certainly
sir
eneas
must
have
been
a
most
wonderful
man
nobody
can
deny
that
and
there
can
be
no
question
but
he
had
the
to
the
greatest
degree
indeed
i
never
heard
it
disputed
many
of
his
prophecies
indeed
seem
to
have
been
quite
incomprehensible
but
that
is
so
much
the
more
extraordinary
you
know
for
instance
the
one
with
regard
to
our
family
lowering
her
voice
for
my
part
i
declare
i
never
could
comprehend
it
and
yet
there
must
be
something
in
it
too
but
how
any
branch
from
the
glenfern
tree
of
course
you
know
that
can
only
mean
the
family
tree
should
help
to
prop
lochmarlie
walls
is
what
i
ca
conceive
if
sir
sampson
had
a
son
to
be
sure
some
of
the
girls
for
you
know
it
ca
be
any
of
us
at
least
i
declare
for
my
own
part
i
sure
even
if
any
thing
which
i
trust
in
goodness
there
is
not
the
least
chance
of
should
ever
happen
to
dear
lady
maclaughlan
and
sir
sampson
should
take
it
into
his
head
which
of
course
is
a
thing
not
to
be
thought
about
and
indeed
i
quite
convinced
it
would
be
very
much
out
of
respect
to
dear
lady
maclaughlan
a
friendship
for
us
if
such
a
thing
was
ever
into
his
head
here
the
tender
grizzy
got
so
involved
in
her
own
ideas
as
to
the
possibility
of
lady
maclaughlan
death
and
the
propriety
of
sir
sampson
proposals
together
with
the
fulfilling
of
sir
eneas
the
seer
prophecy
that
there
is
no
saying
how
far
she
strayed
in
her
labyrinth
such
as
choose
to
follow
her
may
for
our
part
we
prefer
accompanying
the
youthful
becky
to
her
chamber
whither
she
was
also
attended
by
the
lady
of
the
mansion
becky
destiny
for
the
night
lay
at
the
top
of
one
of
those
little
straggling
wooden
stairs
common
in
old
houses
which
creaked
in
all
directions
the
bed
was
placed
in
a
recess
dark
as
erebus
and
betwixt
the
bed
and
the
wall
was
a
depth
profound
which
becky
eye
dared
not
attempt
to
penetrate
you
will
find
everything
right
here
child
said
lady
maclaughlan
and
if
anything
should
be
wrong
you
must
think
it
right
i
never
suffer
anything
to
be
wrong
here
humph
becky
emboldened
by
despair
cast
a
look
towards
the
recess
and
in
a
faint
voice
ventured
to
inquire
is
there
no
fear
that
tom
jones
or
gil
blas
may
be
in
that
place
behind
the
bed
and
if
they
should
answered
her
hostess
in
her
most
appalling
tone
what
is
that
to
you
are
you
a
mouse
that
you
are
afraid
they
will
eat
you
yes
i
suppose
you
are
you
are
perhaps
the
princess
in
the
fairy
tale
who
was
a
woman
by
day
and
a
mouse
by
night
i
believe
you
are
bewitched
so
i
wish
your
mouseship
a
good
night
and
she
descended
the
creaking
stair
singing
mrs
mouse
are
you
within
till
even
her
stentorian
voice
was
lost
in
distance
poor
becky
heart
died
with
the
retreating
sounds
and
only
revived
to
beat
time
with
the
worm
in
the
wood
long
and
eerie
was
the
night
as
she
gave
herself
up
to
all
the
horrors
of
a
superstitious
mind
ghosts
gray
black
and
white
flitted
around
her
couch
cats
half
human
held
her
throat
the
deathwatch
ticked
in
her
ears
at
length
the
light
of
morning
shed
its
brightening
influence
on
the
dim
opaque
of
her
understanding
and
when
all
things
stood
disclosed
in
light
she
shut
her
eyes
and
oped
her
mouth
in
all
the
blissfulness
of
security
the
light
of
day
was
indeed
favourable
for
displaying
to
advantage
the
beauties
of
lochmarlie
castle
which
owed
more
to
nature
than
art
it
was
beautifully
situated
on
a
smooth
green
bank
that
rose
somewhat
abruptly
from
the
lake
and
commanded
a
view
which
if
not
extensive
was
yet
full
of
variety
and
grandeur
its
venerable
turrets
reared
themselves
above
the
trees
which
seemed
coeval
with
them
and
the
vast
magnificence
of
its
lawns
and
extensive
forests
seemed
to
appertain
to
some
feudal
prince
lofty
domain
but
in
vain
were
creation
charms
spread
before
lady
eyes
woods
and
mountains
and
lakes
and
rivers
were
odious
things
and
her
heart
panted
for
dusty
squares
and
suffocating
something
was
said
of
departing
by
the
sisters
when
the
party
met
at
breakfast
but
this
was
immediately
negatived
in
the
most
decided
manner
by
their
hostess

you
have
taken
your

you
must

mine
to

thursday
was
the
day
i
invited
you
for

at

wanted
you
for

you
must
stay

and
go
away
on

my

go
with
you

the
sisters
charmed
with
what
they
termed
the
hospitality
and
friendship
of
this
invitation
delightedly
agreed
to
remain
and
as
things
were
at
least
conducted
in
better
style
there
than
at

uncomfortable
as
it
was
lady
juliana
found
herself
somewhat
nearer
home
there
than
at
the
family
chateau
lady
maclaughlan
who
commonly
civil
in
her
own
house
was
at
some
pains
to
amuse
her
guest
by
showing
her
collection
of
china
and
cabinet
of
gems
both
of
which
were
remarkably
fine
there
was
also
a
library
and
a
gallery
containing
some
good
pictures
and
what
lady
juliana
prized
still
more
a
billiard
table
thursday
the
destined
day
at
length
arrived
and
a
large
party
assembled
to
dinner
lady
juliana
as
she
half
reclined
on
a
sofa
surveyed
the
company
with
a
supercilious
stare
and
without
deigning
to
take
any
part
in
the
general
conversation
that
went
on
it
was
enough
that
they
spoke
with
a
peculiar
accent
everything
they
said
must
be
barbarous
but
she
was
pleased
once
more
to
eat
off
plate
and
to
find
herself
in
rooms
which
though
grotesque
and
comfortless
yet
wore
an
air
of
state
and
whose
vastness
enabled
her
to
keep
aloof
from
those
with
whom
she
never
willingly
came
in
contact
it
was
therefore
with
regret
she
saw
the
day
of
her
departure
arrive
and
found
herself
once
more
an
unwilling
inmate
of
her
only
asylum
particularly
as
her
situation
now
required
comforts
and
indulgences
which
it
was
there
impossible
to
procure

the

so
long
and

by

at

and
lady
juliana
presented
to
the
house
of
douglas
not
alas
the
heir
to
its
ancient
consequence
but
who
could
only
be
regarded
as
additional
burdens
on
its
poverty
the
old
gentleman
disappointment
was
excessive
and
as
he
paced
up
and
down
the
parlour
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
muttered
twa
lasses
i
heard
tell
o
the
like
i
wonder
whar
their
tochers
are
to
come
frae
miss
grizzy
in
great
perturbation
declared
it
certainly
was
a
great
pity
it
had
so
happened
but
these
things
could
be
helped
she
was
sure
lady
maclaughlan
would
be
greatly
surprised
miss
jacky
saw
no
cause
for
regret
and
promised
herself
an
endless
source
of
delight
in
forming
the
minds
and
training
the
ideas
of
her
infant
nieces
miss
nicky
wondered
how
they
were
to
be
nursed
she
was
afraid
lady
juliana
would
not
be
able
for
both
and
had
such
stomachs
henry
meanwhile
whose
love
had
all
revived
in
anxiety
for
the
safety
and
anguish
for
the
sufferings
of
his
youthful
partner
had
hastened
to
her
apartment
and
kneeling
by
her
side
he
pressed
her
hands
to
his
lips
with
feelings
of
the
deepest
emotion
dearer
a
thousand
times
dearer
to
me
than
ever
whispered
he
as
he
fondly
embraced
her
and
those
sweet
pledges
of
our
love
ah
do
mention
them
interrupted
his
lady
in
a
languid
tone
how
very
provoking
i
hate
girls
so
and
two
of
them
oh
and
she
sighed
deeply
her
husband
sighed
too
but
from
a
different
cause
the
nurse
now
appeared
and
approached
with
her
helpless
charges
and
both
parents
for
the
first
time
looked
on
their
own
offspring
what
nice
little
creatures
said
the
delighted
father
as
taking
them
in
his
arms
he
imprinted
the
first
kiss
on
the
innocent
faces
of
his
daughters
and
then
held
them
to
their
mother
who
turning
from
them
with
disgust
exclaimed
how
can
you
kiss
them
harry
they
are
so
ugly
and
they
squall
so
oh
do
for
heaven
sake
take
them
away
and
see
there
is
poor
psyche
quite
wretched
at
being
so
long
away
from
me
pray
put
her
on
the
bed
she
will
grow
fond
of
her
babies
said
poor
henry
to
himself
as
he
quitted
the
apartment
with
feelings
very
different
from
those
with
which
he
entered
it
at
the
pressing
solicitations
of
her
husband
the
fashionable
mother
was
prevailed
upon
to
attempt
nursing
one
of
her
poor
starving
infants
but
the
first
trial
proved
also
the
last
as
she
declared
nothing
upon
earth
should
ever
induce
her
to
perform
so
odious
an
office
and
as
henry
entreaties
and
her
aunts
remonstrances
served
alike
to
irritate
and
agitate
her
the
contest
was
by
the
advice
of
her
medical
attendant
completely
given
up
a
was
therefore
procured
but
as
she
refused
to
undertake
both
children
and
the
old
gentleman
would
not
hear
of
having
two
such
encumbrances
in
his
family
it
was
settled
to
the
unspeakable
delight
of
the
maiden
sisters
that
the
youngest
should
be
entrusted
entirely
to
their
management
and
brought
up
by
hand
the
consequence
was
such
as
might
have
been
foreseen
the
child
who
was
naturally
weak
and
delicate
at
its
birth
daily
lost
a
portion
of
its
little
strength
while
its
continued
cries
declared
the
intensity
of
its
sufferings
though
they
produced
no
other
effect
on
its
unfeeling
mother
than
her
having
it
removed
to
a
more
distant
apartment
as
she
could
not
endure
to
hear
the
cross
little
thing
scream
so
for
nothing
on
the
other
hand
the
more
favoured
twin
who
was
from
its
birth
a
remarkably
strong
lively
infant
and
met
with
all
justice
from
its
nurse
throve
apace
and
was
pronounced
by
her
to
be
the
very
picture
of
the
leddie
its
mamma
and
then
with
all
the
low
cunning
of
her
kind
she
would
launch
forth
into
panegyrics
of
its
beauty
and
prophecies
of
the
great
dignities
and
honours
that
would
one
day
be
showered
upon
it
until
by
her
fawning
and
flattery
she
succeeded
in
exciting
a
degree
of
interest
which
nature
had
not
secured
for
it
in
the
mother
breast
things
were
in
this
situation
when
at
the
end
of
three
weeks
and
douglas
arrived
to
offer
their
congratulations
on
the
birth
of
the
twins
lady
juliana
received
her
in
her
apartment
which
she
had
not
yet
quitted
and
replied
to
her
congratulations
only
by
querulous
complaints
and
childish
murmurs
i
am
sure
you
are
very
happy
in
not
having
children
continued
she
as
the
cries
of
the
little
sufferer
reached
her
ear
i
hope
to
goodness
i
shall
never
have
any
more
i
wonder
if
anybody
ever
had
twin
daughters
before
and
i
too
who
hate
girls
so
mrs
douglas
disgusted
with
her
unfeeling
folly
knew
not
what
to
reply
and
a
pause
ensued
but
afresh
burst
of
cries
from
the
unfortunate
baby
again
called
forth
its
mother
indignation
i
wish
to
goodness
that
child
was
gagged
cried
she
holding
her
hands
to
her
ears
it
has
done
nothing
but
scream
since
the
hour
it
was
born
and
it
makes
me
quite
sick
to
hear
it
poor
little
dear
said
douglas
compassionately
it
appears
to
suffer
a
great
deal
suffer
repeated
her
what
can
it
suffer
i
am
sure
it
meets
with
a
great
deal
attention
than
any
person
in
the
house
these
three
old
women
do
nothing
but
feed
it
from
morning
to
night
with
everything
they
can
think
of
and
make
such
a
fuss
about
it
i
suspect
my
dear
sister
you
would
be
very
sorry
for
yourself
said
douglas
with
a
smile
were
you
to
endure
the
same
treatment
as
your
poor
baby
stuffed
with
improper
food
and
loathsome
drugs
and
bandied
about
from
one
person
to
another
you
may
say
what
you
please
retorted
lady
juliana
pettishly
but
i
know
it
nothing
but
ill
temper
nurse
says
so
too
and
it
is
so
ugly
with
constantly
crying
that
i
can
not
bear
to
look
at
it
and
she
turned
away
her
head
as
miss
jacky
entered
with
the
little
culprit
in
her
arms
which
she
was
vainly
endeavouring
to
silence
while
she
dandled
it
in
the
most
awkward
manner
imaginable
good
heavens
what
a
fright
exclaimed
the
tender
parent
as
her
child
was
held
up
to
her
why
it
is
much
less
than
when
it
was
born
an
its
skin
is
as
yellow
as
saffron
and
it
squints
only
look
what
a
difference
as
the
nurse
advanced
and
ostentatiously
displayed
her
charge
who
had
just
waked
out
of
a
long
sleep
its
checks
flushed
with
heat
its
skin
completely
filled
up
and
its
large
eyes
rolling
under
its
already
dark
eyelashes
the
bonny
wean
just
her
mamma
pickter
drawled
out
the
nurse
but
the
wee
missy
uncolike
her
aunties
take
her
away
cried
lady
juliana
in
a
tone
of
despair
i
wish
i
could
send
her
out
of
my
hearing
altogether
for
her
noise
will
be
the
death
of
me
alas
what
would
i
give
to
hear
the
blessed
sound
of
a
living
child
exclaimed
douglas
taking
the
infant
in
her
arms
and
how
great
would
be
my
happiness
could
i
call
the
poor
rejected
one
mine
i
sure
you
are
welcome
to
my
share
of
the
little
plague
said
her
with
a
laugh
if
you
can
prevail
upon
harry
to
give
up
his
i
would
give
up
a
great
deal
could
my
poor
child
find
a
mother
replied
her
husband
who
just
then
entered
my
dear
brother
cried
douglas
her
eyes
beaming
with
delight
do
you
then
confirm
lady
juliana
kind
promise
indeed
i
will
be
a
mother
to
your
dear
baby
and
love
her
as
if
she
were
my
own
and
in
a
month
oh
in
much
less
time
you
shall
see
her
as
stout
as
her
sister
henry
sighed
as
he
thought
has
not
my
poor
babe
such
a
mother
of
its
own
then
thanking
his
for
her
generous
intentions
he
reminded
her
that
she
must
consult
her
husband
as
few
men
liked
to
be
troubled
with
any
children
but
their
own
you
are
in
the
right
said
douglas
blushing
at
the
impetuosity
of
feeling
which
had
made
her
forget
for
an
instant
the
deference
due
to
her
husband
i
shall
instantly
ask
his
permission
and
he
is
so
indulgent
to
all
my
wishes
that
i
have
little
doubt
of
obtaining
his
consent
and
with
the
child
in
her
arms
she
hastened
to
her
husband
and
made
known
her
request
douglas
received
the
proposal
with
considerable
coolness
wondering
what
his
wife
could
see
in
such
an
ugly
squalling
thing
to
plague
herself
about
it
if
it
had
been
a
boy
old
enough
to
speak
and
run
about
there
might
be
some
amusement
in
it
but
he
could
not
see
the
use
of
a
squalling
sickly
infant
and
a
girl
too
his
wife
sighed
deeply
and
the
tears
stole
down
her
cheeks
as
she
looked
on
the
wan
visage
and
closed
eyes
of
the
little
sufferer
god
help
thee
poor
baby
said
she
mournfully
you
are
rejected
on
all
hands
but
your
misery
will
soon
be
at
a
end
and
she
was
slowly
leaving
the
room
with
her
helpless
charge
when
her
husband
touched
at
the
sight
of
her
distress
though
the
feeling
that
caused
it
he
did
not
comprehend
called
to
her
i
am
sure
alicia
if
you
really
wish
to
take
charge
of
the
infant
i
have
no
objections
only
i
think
you
will
find
it
la
great
plague
and
the
mother
is
such
a
fool
worse
than
a
fool
said
douglas
indignantly
for
she
hates
and
abjures
this
her
poor
unoffending
babe
does
she
so
cried
douglas
every
kindling
feeling
roused
within
him
at
the
idea
of
his
blood
being
hated
and
abjured
then
hang
me
if
she
shall
have
any
child
of
harry
to
hate
as
long
as
i
have
a
house
to
shelter
it
and
a
sixpence
to
bestow
upon
it
taking
the
infant
in
his
arms
and
kindly
kissing
it
douglas
smiled
through
her
tears
as
she
embraced
her
husband
and
praised
his
goodness
and
generosity
then
full
of
exultation
and
delight
she
flew
to
impart
the
success
of
her
mission
to
the
parents
of
her
great
was
the
surprise
of
the
maiden
nurses
at
finding
they
were
to
be
bereft
of
their
little
charge
i
declare
i
think
the
child
is
doing
as
well
as
possible
said
miss
grizzy
to
be
sure
it
does
yammer
constantly
that
ca
be
denied
and
it
is
uncommonly
small
nobody
can
dispute
that
at
the
same
time
i
am
sure
i
ca
tell
what
makes
it
cry
for
i
given
it
two
colic
powders
every
day
and
a
of
lady
maclaughlan
carminative
every
three
hours
and
i
done
nothing
but
make
and
chop
rusks
for
it
quoth
miss
nicky
and
yet
it
is
never
satisfied
i
wonder
what
it
would
be
at
i
know
perfectly
well
what
it
would
be
at
said
miss
jacky
with
an
air
of
importance
all
this
crying
and
screaming
is
for
nothing
else
but
a
nurse
but
it
ought
not
to
be
indulged
there
is
no
end
of
indulging
the
desires
and
is
amazing
how
cunning
children
are
and
how
soon
they
know
how
to
take
advantage
of
people
weakness
glancing
an
eye
of
fire
at
douglas
were
that
my
child
i
would
feed
her
on
bread
and
water
before
i
would
humour
her
fancies
a
pretty
lesson
indeed
if
she
to
have
her
own
way
before
she
a
month
old
douglas
knew
that
it
was
in
vain
to
attempt
arguing
with
her
aunts
she
therefore
allowed
them
to
wonder
and
declaim
over
their
sucking
pots
colic
powders
and
other
instruments
of
torture
while
she
sent
to
the
wife
of
one
of
her
tenants
who
had
lately
and
who
wished
for
the
situation
of
nurse
appointing
her
to
be
at
lochmarlie
the
following
day
having
made
her
arrangements
and
collected
the
scanty
portion
of
clothing
nurse
chose
to
allow
douglas
repaired
to
her
apartment
with
her
little
charge
in
her
arms
she
found
her
still
in
bed
and
surrounded
with
her
favourites
so
you
really
are
going
to
torment
yourself
with
that
little
said
she
well
i
must
say
it
very
good
of
you
but
i
am
afraid
you
will
soon
tire
of
her
children
are
such
plagues
are
they
not
my
darling
added
she
kissing
her
pug
you
will
not
say
so
when
you
have
seen
my
little
girl
a
month
hence
said
douglas
trying
to
conceal
her
disgust
for
henry
sake
who
had
just
then
entered
the
room
she
has
promised
me
never
to
cry
any
more
so
give
her
a
kiss
and
let
us
be
gone
the
mother
slightly
touched
the
cheek
of
her
sleeping
babe
extended
her
finger
to
her
and
carelessly
bidding
them
returned
to
her
pillow
and
her
pugs
henry
accompanied
douglas
to
the
carriage
and
before
they
parted
he
promised
his
brother
to
ride
over
to
lochmarlie
in
a
few
days
he
said
nothing
of
his
child
but
his
glistening
eye
and
the
warm
pressure
of
his
hand
spoke
volumes
to
the
kind
heart
of
his
brother
who
assured
him
that
alicia
would
be
very
good
to
his
little
girl
and
that
he
was
sure
she
would
get
quite
well
when
she
got
a
nurse
the
carriage
drove
off
and
henry
with
a
heavy
spirit
returned
to
the
house
to
listen
to
his
father
lectures
his
aunts
ejaculations
and
his
wife
murmurs
chapter

we
may
boldly

upon
the

stronger
sense
of
the
total
dependence
and
extreme
helplessness
of
his
condition
yet
how
to
remedy
it
he
knew
not
to
accept
of
his
proposal
was
out
of
the
question
and
it
was
equally
impossible
for
him
were
he
ever
so
inclined
to
remain
much
longer
a
burden
on
the
narrow
income
of
the
laird
of
glenfern
one
alternative
only
remained
which
was
to
address
the
friend
and
patron
of
his
youth
general
cameron
and
to
him
he
therefore
wrote
describing
all
the
misery
of
his
situation
and
imploring
his
forgiveness
and
assistance
the
old
general
passion
must
have
cooled
by
this
time
thought
he
to
himself
as
he
sealed
the
letter
and
as
he
has
often
overlooked
former
scrapes
i
think
after
all
he
will
help
me
out
of
this
greatest
one
of
all
for
once
henry
was
not
mistaken
he
received
an
answer
to
his
letter
in
which
the
general
after
execrating
his
folly
in
marrying
a
lady
of
quality
swearing
at
the
birth
of
his
twin
daughters
and
giving
him
some
wholesome
counsel
as
to
his
future
mode
of
life
concluded
by
informing
him
that
he
had
got
him
reinstated
in
his
former
rank
in
the
army
that
he
should
settle
seven
hundred
per
annum
on
him
till
he
saw
how
matters
were
conducted
and
in
the
meantime
enclosed
a
draught
for
four
hundred
pounds
to
open
the
campaign
though
this
was
not
according
to
henry
notions
coming
down
handsomely
still
it
was
better
than
not
coming
down
at
all
and
with
a
mixture
of
delight
and
disappointment
he
flew
to
communicate
the
tidings
to
lady
juliana
seven
hundred
pounds
a
year
exclaimed
she
in
raptures
heavens
what
a
quantity
of
money
why
we
shall
be
quite
rich
and
i
shall
have
such
a
beautiful
house
and
such
pretty
carriages
and
give
such
parties
and
buy
so
many
fine
things
oh
dear
how
happy
i
shall
be
you
know
little
of
money
julia
if
you
think
seven
hundred
pounds
will
do
all
that
replied
her
husband
gravely
i
hardly
think
we
can
afford
a
house
in
town
but
we
may
have
a
pretty
cottage
at
richmond
or
twickenham
and
i
can
keep
a
curricle
and
drive
you
about
you
know
and
we
may
give
famous
good
dinners
a
dispute
here
ensued
her
ladyship
hated
cottages
and
curricles
and
good
dinners
as
much
as
her
husband
despised
fancy
balls
opera
boxes
and
chariots
the
fact
was
that
the
one
knew
very
nearly
as
much
of
the
real
value
of
money
as
the
other
and
henry
scheme
was
just
as
practicable
as
his
wife
extravagant
one
brought
up
in
the
luxurious
profusion
of
great
house
accustomed
to
issue
her
orders
and
have
them
obeyed
lady
juliana
at
the
time
she
married
was
in
the
most
blissful
state
of
ignorance
respecting
the
value
of
pounds
shillings
and
pence
her
maid
took
care
to
have
her
wardrobe
supplied
with
all
things
needful
and
when
she
wanted
a
new
dress
or
a
fashionable
jewel
it
was
only
driving
to
madame
or
mr
y
and
desiring
the
article
to
be
sent
to
herself
while
the
bill
went
to
her
papa
from
never
seeing
money
in
its
own
vulgar
form
lady
juliana
had
learned
to
consider
it
as
a
mere
nominal
thing
while
on
the
other
hand
her
husband
from
seeing
too
much
of
it
had
formed
almost
equally
erroneous
ideas
of
its
powers
by
the
mistake
kindness
of
general
cameron
he
had
been
indulged
in
all
the
fashionable
follies
of
the
day
and
allowed
to
use
his
patron
ample
fortune
as
if
it
had
already
been
his
own
nor
was
it
until
he
found
himself
a
prisoner
at
glenfern
from
want
of
money
that
he
had
ever
attached
the
smallest
importance
to
it
in
short
both
the
husband
and
wife
had
been
accustomed
to
look
upon
it
in
the
same
light
as
the
air
they
breathed
they
knew
it
essential
to
life
and
concluded
that
it
would
come
some
way
or
other
either
from
the
east
or
west
north
or
south
as
for
the
vulgar
concerns
of
meat
and
drink
servants
wages
taxes
and
so
forth
they
never
found
a
place
in
the
calculations
of
either
birthday
dresses
fetes
operas
equipages
and
state
liveries
whirled
in
rapid
succession
through
lady
juliana
brain
while
clubs
curricles
horses
and
claret
took
possession
of
her
husband
mind
however
much
they
differed
in
the
proposed
modes
of
showing
off
in
london
both
agreed
perfectly
in
the
necessity
of
going
there
and
henry
therefore
hastened
to
inform
his
father
of
the
change
in
his
circumstances
and
apprise
him
of
his
intention
of
immediately
joining
his
regiment
the
guards
seven
hunder
pound
a
year
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
seven
hunder
pound
o
what
can
ye
mak
o
a
that
siller
ye
surely
lay
by
the
half
to
tocher
your
bairns
seven
hunder
pound
a
year
for
doing
naething
miss
jacky
was
afraid
unless
they
got
some
person
of
sense
which
would
not
be
an
easy
matter
to
take
the
management
of
it
it
would
perhaps
be
found
little
enough
in
the
miss
grizzy
declared
it
was
a
very
handsome
income
nobody
could
dispute
that
at
the
same
time
everybody
must
allow
that
the
money
could
not
have
been
better
bestowed
miss
nicky
observed
there
was
a
great
deal
of
good
eating
and
drinking
in
seven
hundred
a
year
if
people
knew
how
to
manage
it
all
was
bustle
and
preparation
throughout
glenfern
castle
and
the
young
ladies
activity
and
muscular
powers
were
again
in
requisition
to
collect
the
wardrobe
and
pack
the
trunks
imperial
of
their
noble
sister
glenfern
remarked
that
fules
war
fond
o
flitting
for
they
seemed
glad
to
leave
the
good
quarters
they
were
in
miss
grizzy
declared
there
was
a
great
excuse
for
their
being
glad
poor
things
young
people
were
always
so
fond
of
a
change
at
the
same
time
nobody
could
deny
but
that
it
would
have
been
quite
natural
for
them
to
feel
sorry
too
miss
jacky
was
astonished
how
any
person
mind
could
be
so
callous
as
to
think
of
leaving
glenfern
without
emotion
miss
nicky
wondered
what
was
to
become
of
the
christening
cake
she
had
ordered
from
perth
it
might
be
as
old
as
the
hills
before
there
would
be
another
child
born
amongst
them
the
misses
were
ready
to
weep
at
the
disappointment
of
the
in
the
midst
of
all
this
agitation
mental
and
bodily
the
moment
arrived
the
carriage
drove
round
ready
packed
and
loaded
and
absolutely
screaming
with
delight
lady
juliana
sprang
into
it
as
she
nodded
and
kissed
her
hand
to
the
assembled
group
she
impatiently
called
to
henry
to
follow
his
adieus
were
however
not
quite
so
tonish
as
those
of
his
lady
for
he
went
duly
and
severally
through
all
the
evolutions
of
kissing
embracing
shaking
of
hands
and
promises
to
write
then
taking
his
station
by
the
side
of
the
nurse
and
child
the
rest
of
the
carriage
being
completely
filled
by
the
favourites
he
bade
a
long
farewell
to
his
paternal
halls
and
the
land
of
his
birth

as
these
to
serious
mischiefs
lead
the
man
i
love
horace
bright
prospects
of
future
happiness
and
endless
plans
of
expense
floated
through
lady
juliana
brain
and
kept
her
temper
in
some
degree
of
serenity
during
the
journey
arrived
in
london
she
expressed
herself
enraptured
at
being
once
more
in
a
civilised
country
and
restored
to
the
society
of
human
creatures
an
elegant
house
and
suitable
establishment
were
immediately
provided
and
a
thousand
dear
friends
who
had
completely
forgotten
her
existence
were
now
eager
to
welcome
her
to
her
former
haunts
and
lead
her
thoughtless
and
willing
steps
in
the
paths
of
dissipation
and
extravagance
soon
after
their
arrival
they
were
visited
by
general
cameron
it
was
two
yet
lady
juliana
had
not
appeared
and
henry
upon
a
sofa
was
dawdling
over
his
breakfast
with
newspapers
scattered
round
the
first
salutations
over
the
general
demanded
am
i
not
to
be
favoured
with
a
sight
of
your
lady
is
she
afraid
that
i
am
one
of
your
country
relations
and
taken
her
flight
from
the
in
consequence
she
has
not
yet
made
her
appearance
replied
douglas
but
i
will
let
her
know
you
are
here
i
am
sure
she
will
be
happy
to
make
acquaintance
with
one
to
whom
i
am
so
much
indebted
a
message
was
despatched
to
lady
juliana
who
returned
for
answer
that
she
would
be
down
immediately
three
quarters
of
an
hour
however
elapsed
and
the
general
provoked
with
this
inattention
and
affectation
was
preparing
to
depart
when
the
lady
made
her
appearance
juliana
my
love
said
her
husband
let
me
present
you
to
general
cameron
the
generous
friend
who
has
acted
the
part
of
a
father
towards
me
and
to
whom
you
owe
all
the
comforts
you
enjoy
lady
juliana
slightly
bowed
with
careless
ease
and
half
uttered
a
how
d
do
very
happy
indeed
as
she
glided
on
to
pull
the
bell
for
breakfast
cupid
cupid
cried
she
to
the
dog
who
had
flown
upon
the
general
and
was
barking
most
vehemently
poor
darling
cupid
are
you
almost
starved
to
death
harry
do
give
him
that
muffin
on
your
plate
you
are
very
late
my
love
cried
the
mortified
husband
i
have
been
pestered
for
the
last
hour
with
duval
and
the
court
dresses
and
i
could
not
fix
on
what
i
should
like
i
think
you
might
have
deferred
the
ceremony
of
choosing
to
another
opportunity
general
cameron
has
been
here
above
an
hour
dear
i
hope
you
did
not
wait
for
me
i
shall
be
quite
shocked
drawled
out
her
ladyship
in
a
tone
denoting
how
very
indifferent
the
answer
would
be
to
her
i
beg
your
ladyship
would
be
under
no
uneasiness
on
that
account
replied
the
general
in
an
ironical
tone
which
though
lost
upon
her
was
obvious
enough
to
henry
have
you
breakfasted
asked
lady
juliana
exerting
herself
to
be
polite
absurd
my
love
cried
her
husband
do
you
suppose
i
should
have
allowed
the
general
to
wait
for
that
too
all
this
time
if
he
had
not
breakfasted
many
hours
ago
how
cross
you
are
this
morning
my
harry
i
protest
my
cupidon
is
quite
ashamed
of
your
a
servant
now
entered
to
say
shagg
was
come
to
know
her
final
decision
about
the
and
the
new
footman
was
come
to
be
engaged
and
the
china
merchant
was
below
send
up
one
of
them
at
a
time
and
as
to
the
footman
you
may
say
have
him
at
once
said
lady
juliana
i
thought
you
had
engaged
footman
last
week
she
gave
him
the
best
character
did
she
not
asked
her
husband
oh
yes
his
character
was
good
enough
but
he
was
a
horrid
cheat
for
all
that
he
called
himself
five
feet
nine
and
when
he
was
measured
he
turned
out
to
be
only
five
feet
seven
and
a
half
pshaw
exclaimed
henry
angrily
what
the
devil
did
that
signify
if
the
man
had
a
good
character
how
absurdly
you
talk
harry
as
if
a
man
character
signified
who
has
nothing
to
do
but
to
stand
behind
my
carriage
a
pretty
figure
he
made
there
beside
thomas
who
is
at
least
five
feet
ten
the
entrance
of
shagg
bowing
and
scraping
and
laden
with
cloths
lace
and
fringes
interrupted
the
conversation
well
shagg
cried
lady
juliana
what
to
be
done
with
that
odious
leopard
skin
you
must
positively
take
it
off
my
hands
i
would
rather
never
go
in
a
carriage
again
as
show
myself
in
the
park
with
that
frightful
thing
certainly
my
lady
replied
the
obsequious
shagg
anything
your
ladyship
pleases
your
ladyship
can
have
any
you
like
and
i
have
accordingly
brought
patterns
of
the
very
newest
fashions
for
your
ladyship
to
make
choice
here
are
some
uncommon
elegant
articles
at
the
same
time
my
lady
your
ladyship
must
be
sensible
that
it
is
impossible
that
we
can
take
back
the
leopard
skin
it
was
not
only
cut
out
to
fit
your
ladyship
and
consequently
your
ladyship
understands
it
would
not
fit
any
other
but
the
silver
feet
and
crests
have
also
been
affixed
quite
ready
for
use
so
that
the
article
is
quite
lost
to
us
i
am
confident
therefore
that
your
ladyship
will
consider
of
this
and
allow
it
to
be
put
down
in
your
bill
put
it
anywhere
but
on
my
and
do
bore
me
answered
lady
juliana
tossing
over
all
the
patterns
and
humming
a
tune
what
said
her
husband
is
that
the
leopard
skin
you
were
raving
about
last
week
and
your
are
tired
of
it
before
it
has
been
used
and
no
wonder
who
do
you
think
i
saw
in
the
park
yesterday
but
that
old
quiz
lady
denham
just
come
from
the
country
with
her
frightful
old
coach
set
off
with
a
precisely
like
the
one
i
had
ordered
only
fancy
people
saying
lady
denham
sets
the
fashion
for
lady
juliana
douglas
oh
there
confusion
and
despair
in
the
thought
confusion
at
least
if
not
despair
was
painted
in
henry
face
as
he
saw
the
general
glance
directed
alternately
with
contempt
at
lady
juliana
and
at
himself
mingled
with
pity
he
continued
to
fidget
about
in
all
directions
while
lady
juliana
talked
nonsense
to
shagg
and
wondered
if
the
general
never
meant
to
go
away
but
he
calmly
kept
his
ground
till
the
man
was
dismissed
and
another
introduced
loaded
with
china
jars
monsters
and
distorted
teapots
for
the
capricious
fair
one
choice
and
approbation
beg
ten
thousand
pardons
my
lady
for
not
calling
yesterday
according
to
appointment
quite
an
unforeseen
impediment
the
countess
of
godolphin
had
somehow
got
private
intelligence
that
i
had
a
set
of
fresh
commodities
just
cleared
from
the
custom
house
and
well
knowing
such
things
are
not
long
in
hand
her
came
up
from
the
country
on
purpose
the
countess
has
so
much
taste
she
drove
straight
to
my
warehouse
and
kept
me
a
close
prisoner
till
after
your
hour
but
i
hope
it
may
not
be
taken
amiss
seeing
that
it
is
not
a
customary
thing
with
us
to
be
calling
on
customers
not
to
mention
that
this
line
of
goods
is
not
easily
transported
about
however
i
flatter
myself
the
articles
now
brought
for
your
ladyship
inspection
will
not
be
found
beneath
your
notice
please
to
observe
this
choice
piece
it
represents
a
chinese
cripple
squat
on
the
ground
with
his
legs
crossed
your
ladyship
may
observe
the
head
and
chin
advanced
forwards
as
in
the
act
of
begging
the
tea
pours
from
the
open
mouth
and
till
your
ladyship
tries
you
can
have
no
idea
of
the
elegant
effect
it
produces
that
is
really
droll
cried
lady
juliana
with
a
laugh
of
delight
and
i
must
have
the
dear
sick
beggar
he
is
so
deliciously
hideous
and
here
continued
brittle
is
an
amazing
delicate
article
in
the
way
of
a
jewel
a
frog
of
turkish
agate
for
burning
pastiles
in
my
lady
just
such
as
they
use
in
the
seraglio
and
indeed
this
one
i
may
call
invaluable
for
it
was
the
favourite
toy
of
one
of
the
widowed
sultanas
till
she
grew
devout
and
gave
up
perfumes
one
of
her
slaves
disposed
of
it
to
my
foreign
partner
here
it
opens
at
the
tail
where
you
put
in
the
pastiles
and
closing
it
up
the
vapour
issues
beautifully
through
the
nostrils
eyes
ears
and
mouth
all
at
once
here
sir
turning
to
douglas
if
you
are
curious
in
new
workmanship
i
would
have
you
examine
this
i
defy
any
jeweller
in
london
to
come
up
to
the
fineness
of
these
hinges
and
delicacy
of
the
carving
pshaw
damn
it
said
douglas
turning
away
and
addressing
some
remark
to
the
general
who
was
provokingly
attentive
to
everything
that
went
on
here
continued
brittle
are
a
set
of
jars
teapots
mandarins
and
all
of
superior
beauty
but
such
as
your
ladyship
may
have
seen
before
oh
the
dear
dear
little
puggies
i
must
have
them
to
amuse
my
own
darlings
i
protest
here
is
one
the
image
of
psyche
positively
i
must
kiss
it
oh
dear
i
am
sure
cried
brittle
simpering
and
making
a
conceited
bow
your
ladyship
does
it
and
me
too
much
honour
but
here
as
i
was
going
to
say
is
the
phoenix
of
all
porcelain
ware
the
plus
of
perfection
what
i
have
kept
in
my
backroom
concealed
from
all
eyes
until
your
ladyship
shall
pronounce
upon
it
somehow
one
of
my
shopmen
got
word
of
it
and
told
her
grace
of
l
who
has
a
pretty
taste
in
these
things
for
a
young
lady
that
i
had
some
particular
choice
article
that
i
was
keeping
for
a
lady
that
was
a
favourite
of
mine
her
grace
was
in
the
shop
the
matter
of
a
full
hour
and
a
half
trying
to
wheedle
me
out
of
a
sight
of
this
rare
piece
and
i
pretending
not
to
know
what
her
grace
would
be
after
but
showing
her
thing
after
thing
to
put
it
out
of
her
head
but
she
was
not
so
easily
bubbled
and
at
last
went
away
ill
enough
pleased
now
my
lady
prepare
all
your
eyes
he
then
went
to
the
door
and
returned
carrying
with
difficulty
a
large
basket
which
till
then
had
been
kept
by
one
of
his
satellites
after
removing
coverings
of
all
descriptions
an
uncouth
group
of
monstrous
size
was
displayed
which
on
investigation
appeared
to
be
a
serpent
coiled
in
regular
folds
round
the
body
of
a
tiger
placed
on
end
and
the
whole
structure
which
was
intended
for
a
vessel
of
some
kind
was
formed
of
the
celebrated
green
mottled
china
invaluable
to
connoisseurs
view
that
well
exclaimed
brittle
in
a
transport
of
enthusiasm
for
such
a
specimen
not
one
of
half
the
size
has
ever
been
imported
to
europe
there
is
a
long
story
about
this
my
phoenix
as
i
call
it
but
to
be
brief
it
was
secretly
procured
from
one
of
the
temples
where
gigantic
as
it
may
seem
and
uncouth
for
the
purpose
it
was
the
principal
teapot
oh
delicious
cried
lady
juliana
clasping
her
hands
in
ecstasy
i
will
give
a
party
for
the
sole
purpose
of
drinking
tea
out
of
this
machine
and
i
will
have
the
whole
room
fitted
up
like
an
indian
temple
oh
it
will
be
so
new
i
die
to
send
out
my
cards
the
duchess
of
b
told
me
the
other
day
with
such
a
triumphant
air
when
i
was
looking
at
her
two
little
green
jars
not
a
quarter
the
size
of
this
that
there
was
not
a
bit
more
of
that
china
to
be
had
for
love
or
money
oh
she
will
be
so
provoked
and
she
absolutely
skipped
for
joy
a
loud
rap
at
the
door
now
announcing
a
visitor
lady
juliana
ran
to
the
balcony
crying
oh
it
must
be
lady
gerard
for
she
promised
to
call
early
in
the
morning
that
we
might
go
together
to
a
wonderful
sale
in
some
place
in
the
city
at
wapping
for
aught
i
know
brittle
brittle
for
the
love
of
heaven
carry
the
dragon
into
the
back
i
purchase
it
remember
make
haste
lady
gerard
is
not
to
get
a
glimpse
of
it
for
the
world
the
servant
now
entered
with
a
message
from
lady
gerard
who
would
not
alight
begging
that
lady
juliana
would
make
haste
down
to
her
as
they
had
not
a
moment
to
lose
she
was
flying
away
without
further
ceremony
than
a
pray
excuse
me
to
the
general
when
her
husband
called
after
her
to
know
whether
the
child
was
gone
out
as
he
wished
to
show
her
to
the
general
i
do
know
indeed
replied
the
fashionable
mother
i
have
had
time
to
see
her
and
before
douglas
could
reply
she
was
downstairs
a
pause
ensued
the
general
whistled
a
quickstep
and
douglas
walked
up
and
down
the
room
in
a
pitiable
state
of
mind
guessing
pretty
much
what
was
passing
in
the
mind
of
his
friend
and
fully
sensible
that
it
must
be
of
a
severer
nature
than
anything
he
could
yet
allow
himself
to
think
of
his
juliana
douglas
said
the
general
have
you
made
any
step
towards
a
reconciliation
with
your
i
believe
it
will
become
shortly
necessary
for
your
support
juliana
wrote
twice
after
her
marriage
replied
he
but
the
reception
which
her
letters
met
with
was
not
such
as
to
encourage
perseverance
on
our
part
with
regard
to
myself
it
is
not
an
affair
in
which
delicacy
will
permit
me
to
be
very
active
as
i
might
be
accused
of
mercenary
motives
which
i
am
far
from
having
oh
of
that
i
acquit
you
but
surely
it
ought
to
be
a
matter
of
moment
even
to
a
juliana
the
case
is
now
altered
time
must
have
accustomed
him
to
the
idea
of
this
imaginary
affront
and
on
my
honour
if
he
thought
like
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
sense
i
know
where
he
would
think
the
misfortune
lay
nay
do
interrupt
me
the
old
earl
must
now
i
say
have
cooled
in
his
resentment
perhaps
too
his
grandchildren
may
soften
his
heart
this
must
have
occurred
to
you
has
her
ladyship
taken
any
further
steps
since
her
arrival
in
town
i
i
believe
she
has
not
but
i
will
put
her
in
mind
a
daughter
who
requires
to
have
her
memory
refreshed
on
such
a
subject
is
likely
to
make
a
valuable
wife
said
the
general
drily
douglas
felt
as
if
it
was
incumbent
on
him
to
be
angry
but
remained
silent
hark
ye
douglas
continued
the
general
i
speak
this
for
your
interest
you
can
not
go
on
without
the
earl
help
you
know
i
am
not
on
ceremony
with
you
and
if
i
refrain
from
saying
what
you
see
i
think
about
your
present
ruinous
mode
of
life
it
is
not
to
spare
your
feelings
but
from
a
sense
of
the
uselessness
of
any
such
remonstrance
what
i
do
give
you
is
with
goodwill
but
all
my
fortune
would
not
suffice
to
furnish
and
deformed
teapots
for
such
a
vitiated
taste
and
if
it
would
hang
me
if
it
should
but
enough
on
this
head
the
earl
has
been
in
bad
health
and
is
lately
come
to
town
his
son
too
and
his
lady
are
to
come
about
the
same
time
and
are
to
reside
with
him
during
the
season
i
have
heard
lord
lindore
spoken
of
as
a
easy
man
and
he
would
probably
enter
willingly
into
any
scheme
to
reinstate
his
sister
into
his
father
good
graces
think
of
this
and
make
what
you
can
of
it
and
my
particular
advice
to
you
personally
is
try
to
exchange
into
a
marching
regiment
for
a
fellow
like
you
with
such
a
wife
london
is
the
very
devil
and
so
good
morning
to
you
he
snatched
up
his
hat
and
was
off
in
a
moment
chapter
xxi
to
reckon
up
a
thousand
of
her
pranks
her
pride
her
wasteful
spending
her
unkindness
her
scolding
pouting
were
to
reap
an
endless
catalogue
when
lady
juliana
returned
from
her
expedition
it
was
so
late
that
douglas
had
not
time
to
speak
to
her
and
separate
engagements
carrying
them
different
ways
he
had
no
opportunity
to
do
so
until
the
following
morning
at
breakfast
he
then
resolved
no
longer
to
defer
what
he
had
to
say
and
began
by
reproaching
her
with
the
cavalier
manner
in
which
she
had
behaved
to
his
good
friend
the
general
upon
my
life
harry
you
are
grown
perfectly
savage
cried
his
lady
i
was
most
particularly
civil
i
wonder
what
you
would
have
me
to
do
you
know
very
well
i
can
not
have
anything
to
say
to
old
men
of
that
sort
i
think
returned
henry
you
might
have
been
gratified
by
making
an
acquaintance
with
my
benefactor
and
the
man
to
whom
you
owe
the
enjoyment
of
your
favourite
pleasures
at
any
rate
you
need
not
have
made
yourself
ridiculous
may
i
perish
if
i
did
not
wish
myself
underground
while
you
were
talking
nonsense
to
those
sneaking
rascals
who
wheedle
you
out
of
your
money
i
had
a
good
mind
to
throw
them
and
their
trumpery
out
of
the
window
when
i
saw
you
make
such
a
fool
of
yourself
a
fool
of
myself
how
foolishly
you
talk
and
as
for
that
vulgar
awkward
general
he
ought
to
have
been
too
much
flattered
some
of
the
monsters
were
so
like
himself
i
am
sure
he
must
have
thought
i
took
them
for
the
love
of
his
round
bare
pate
upon
my
soul
julia
i
am
ashamed
of
you
do
leave
off
this
excessive
folly
and
try
to
be
rational
what
i
particularly
wished
to
say
to
you
is
that
your
father
is
in
town
and
it
will
be
proper
that
you
should
make
another
effort
to
be
reconciled
to
him
i
dare
say
it
will
answered
lady
juliana
with
a
yawn
and
you
must
lose
no
time
when
will
you
write
there
no
use
in
writing
or
indeed
doing
anything
in
the
matter
i
am
sure
he
wo
forgive
me
and
why
not
oh
why
should
he
do
it
now
he
did
not
forgive
me
when
i
asked
him
before
and
do
you
think
then
for
a
father
forgiveness
it
is
not
worth
while
to
have
a
little
perseverance
i
am
sure
he
wo
do
it
so
is
in
vain
to
try
repeated
she
going
to
the
glass
and
singing

by

julia
cried
her
husband
passionately
you
are
past
all
endurance
can
nothing
touch
you
nothing
fix
your
thoughts
and
make
you
serious
for
a
single
moment
can
i
not
make
you
understand
that
you
are
ruining
yourself
and
me
that
we
have
nothing
to
depend
upon
but
the
bounty
of
that
man
whom
you
disgust
by
your
caprice
extravagance
and
impertinence
and
that
if
you
do
get
reconciled
to
your
father
what
is
to
become
of
you
you
already
know
what
you
have
to
expect
from
my
family
and
how
you
like
living
with
them
heavens
harry
exclaimed
her
ladyship
what
is
all
this
tirade
about
is
it
because
i
said
papa
would
forgive
me
i
sure
i
mind
writing
to
him
i
have
no
objection
the
first
leisure
moment
i
have
but
really
in
town
one
time
is
so
engrossed
at
this
moment
her
maid
entered
in
triumph
carrying
on
her
arms
a
satin
dress
embroidered
with
gold
and
flowers
see
my
lady
cried
she
your
new
robe
as
madame
has
sent
home
half
a
day
sooner
than
her
word
and
she
has
disobliged
several
of
the
quality
by
not
giving
the
pattern
oh
lovely
charming
spread
it
out
gage
hold
it
to
the
light
all
my
own
fancy
only
look
harry
how
exquisite
how
divine
harry
had
no
time
to
express
his
contempt
for
embroidered
robes
for
just
then
one
of
his
knowing
friends
came
by
appointment
to
accompany
him
to
tattersal
where
he
was
to
bid
for
a
famous
pair
of
curricle
grays
days
passed
on
without
lady
juliana
ever
thinking
it
worth
while
to
follow
her
husband
advice
about
applying
to
her
father
until
a
week
after
douglas
overheard
the
following
conversation
between
his
wife
and
one
of
her
acquaintance
you
are
going
to
this
grand
of
course
said
i
told
it
is
to
eclipse
everything
that
has
been
yet
seen
or
heard
of
of
what
do
you
speak
demanded
lady
juliana
lord
my
dear
creature
how
gothic
you
are
do
you
know
anything
about
this
grand
affair
that
everybody
has
been
talking
of
for
two
days
lady
lindore
gives
at
your
father
house
an
entertainment
which
is
to
be
a
concert
ball
and
masquerade
at
once
all
london
is
asked
of
any
distinction
but
bless
me
i
beg
pardon
i
totally
forgot
that
you
were
not
on
the
best
terms
possible
in
that
quarter
but
never
mind
we
must
have
you
go
there
is
not
a
person
of
fashion
that
will
stay
away
i
must
get
you
asked
i
shall
petition
lady
lindore
in
your
favour
oh
pray
do
trouble
yourself
cried
lady
juliana
in
extreme
pique
i
believe
i
can
get
this
done
without
your
obliging
interference
but
i
do
know
whether
i
shall
be
in
town
then
from
this
moment
lady
juliana
resolved
to
make
a
vigorous
effort
to
regain
a
footing
in
her
father
house
her
first
action
the
next
morning
was
to
write
to
her
brother
who
had
hitherto
kept
aloof
because
he
could
not
be
at
the
trouble
of
having
a
difference
with
the
earl
entreating
him
to
use
his
influence
in
promoting
a
reconciliation
between
her
father
and
herself
no
answer
was
returned
for
four
days
at
the
end
of
which
time
lady
juliana
received
the
following
note
from
her
brother
dear
julia
i
quite
agree
with
you
in
thinking
that
you
have
been
kept
long
enough
in
the
corner
and
shall
certainly
tell
papa
that
you
are
ready
to
become
a
good
girl
whenever
he
shall
please
to
take
you
out
of
it
i
shall
endeavour
to
see
douglas
and
you
yours
affectionately
lindore
lady
lindore
desires
me
to
say
you
can
have
tickets
for
her
ball
if
you
choose
to
come
lady
juliana
was
delighted
with
this
billet
which
she
protested
was
everything
that
was
kind
and
generous
but
the
postscript
was
the
part
on
which
she
dwelt
with
the
greatest
delight
as
she
repeatedly
declared
it
was
a
great
deal
more
than
she
expected
you
see
harry
said
she
as
she
tossed
the
note
to
him
i
was
in
the
right
papa
wo
forgive
me
but
lindore
says
he
will
send
me
a
ticket
for
the
it
is
vastly
attentive
of
him
for
i
did
not
ask
it
but
i
must
go
disguised
which
is
monstrous
provoking
for
i
afraid
nobody
will
know
me
a
dispute
here
ensued
henry
swore
she
should
not
steal
into
her
father
house
as
long
as
she
was
his
wife
the
lady
insisted
that
she
should
go
to
her
brother
when
she
was
invited
and
the
altercations
ended
as
altercations
commonly
do
leaving
both
parties
more
wedded
to
their
own
opinion
than
at
first
in
the
evening
lady
juliana
went
to
a
large
party
and
as
she
was
passing
from
one
room
into
another
she
was
startled
by
a
little
paper
pellet
thrown
at
her
turning
round
to
look
for
the
offender
she
saw
her
brother
standing
at
a
little
distance
smiling
at
her
surprise
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
seen
him
for
two
years
and
she
went
up
to
him
with
an
extended
hand
while
he
gave
her
a
familiar
nod
and
a
how
d
do
julia
and
one
finger
of
his
hand
while
he
turned
round
to
speak
to
one
of
his
companions
nothing
could
be
more
characteristic
of
both
parties
than
this
fraternal
meeting
and
from
this
time
they
were
the
best
friends
imaginable

some
days
before
the
expected
lady
juliana
at
the
instigation
of
her
adviser
lady
gerard
resolved
upon
taking
the
field
against
the
duchess
of
l
her
grace
had
issued
cards
for
a
concert
and
after
mature
deliberation
it
was
decided
that
her
rival
should
strike
out
something
new
and
announce
a
christening
for
the
same
night
the
first
intimation
douglas
had
of
the
honour
intended
him
by
this
arrangement
was
through
the
medium
of
the
newspaper
for
the
husband
and
wife
were
now
much
too
fashionable
to
be
at
all
of
each
other
schemes
his
first
emotion
was
to
be
extremely
surprised
the
next
to
be
exceedingly
displeased
and
the
last
to
be
highly
gratified
at
the
with
which
his
child
was
to
be
made
a
christian
true
he
had
intended
requesting
the
general
to
act
as
godfather
upon
the
occasion
but
lady
juliana
protested
she
would
rather
the
child
never
should
be
christened
at
all
which
already
seemed
nearly
to
have
been
the
case
than
have
that
cross
man
to
stand
sponsor
her
ladyship
however
so
far
conceded
that
the
general
was
to
have
the
honour
of
giving
his
name
to
the
next
if
a
boy
for
she
was
now
near
her
second
confinement
and
with
this
promise
henry
was
satisfied
to
slight
the
only
being
in
the
world
to
whom
he
looked
for
support
to
himself
and
his
children
in
the
utmost
delight
the
fond
mother
drove
away
to
consult
her
confidants
upon
the
name
and
decorations
of
the
child
whom
she
had
not
even
looked
at
for
many
days
everything
succeeded
to
admiration
amid
crowds
of
spectators
in
all
the
pomp
of
lace
and
satin
surrounded
by
princes
and
peers
and
handed
from
duchesses
to
countesses
the
twin
daughter
of
henry
douglas
and
the
heroine
of
future
story
became
a
christian
by
the
names
of
adelaide
julia
some
months
previous
to
this
event
lady
juliana
had
received
a
letter
from
douglas
informing
her
of
the
rapid
improvement
that
had
taken
place
in
her
little
charge
and
requesting
to
know
by
what
name
she
should
have
her
christened
at
the
same
time
gently
insinuating
her
wish
that
in
compliance
with
the
custom
of
the
country
and
as
a
compliment
due
to
the
family
it
should
be
named
after
his
paternal
grandmother
lady
juliana
glanced
over
the
first
line
of
the
letter
then
looked
at
the
signature
resolved
to
read
the
rest
as
soon
as
she
should
have
time
to
answer
it
and
in
the
meantime
tossed
it
into
a
drawer
amongst
old
visiting
cards
and
unpaid
bills
after
vainly
waiting
for
an
answer
much
beyond
the
accustomed
time
when
children
are
baptized
douglas
could
no
longer
refuse
to
accede
to
the
desires
of
the
venerable
inmates
of
glenfern
and
about
a
month
before
her
favoured
sister
received
her
more
elegant
appellations
the
neglected
twin
was
baptized
by
the
name
of
mary
douglas
letter
had
been
enclosed
in
the
following
one
from
miss
grizzy
and
as
it
had
not
the
good
fortune
to
be
perused
by
the
person
to
whom
it
was
addressed
we
deem
it
but
justice
to
the
writer
to
insert
it
here
glenfern
castle
my
dearest
niece
lady
juliana
i
am
certain
as
indeed
we
all
are
that
it
will
afford
your
ladyship
and
our
dear
nephew
the
greatest
pleasure
to
see
this
letter
franked
by
our
worthy
and
respectable
friend
sir
sampson
maclaughlan
especially
as
it
is
the
first
he
has
ever
franked
out
of
compliment
to
you
as
i
assure
you
he
admires
you
excessively
as
indeed
we
all
do
at
the
same
time
you
will
of
course
i
am
sure
sympathise
with
us
all
in
the
distress
occasioned
by
the
melancholy
death
of
our
late
most
obliging
member
duncan
esquire
of
dhunacrag
and
auchnagoil
who
you
never
have
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
what
renders
his
death
particularly
distressing
is
that
lady
maclaughlan
is
of
opinion
it
was
entirely
owing
to
eating
raw
oysters
and
damp
feet
this
ought
to
be
a
warning
to
all
young
people
to
take
care
of
wet
feet
and
especially
eating
raw
oysters
which
are
certainly
highly
dangerous
particularly
where
there
is
any
tendency
to
gout
i
hope
my
dear
niece
you
have
got
a
pair
of
stout
walking
shoes
and
that
both
henry
and
you
remember
to
change
your
feet
after
walking
i
am
told
raw
oysters
are
much
the
fashion
in
london
at
present
but
when
this
fatal
event
comes
to
be
known
it
will
of
course
alarm
people
very
much
and
put
them
upon
their
guard
both
as
to
damp
feet
and
raw
oysters
lady
maclaughlan
is
in
high
spirits
at
sir
sampson
success
though
at
the
same
time
i
assure
you
she
felt
much
for
the
distress
of
poor
and
had
sent
him
a
large
box
of
pills
and
a
bottle
of
gout
tincture
only
two
days
before
he
died
this
will
be
a
great
thing
for
you
and
especially
for
henry
my
dear
niece
as
sir
sampson
and
lady
maclaughlan
are
going
to
london
directly
to
take
his
seat
in
parliament
and
she
will
make
a
point
of
paying
you
every
attention
and
will
matronise
you
to
the
play
and
any
other
public
places
you
may
wish
to
go
as
both
my
sisters
and
i
are
of
opinion
you
are
rather
young
to
matronise
yourself
yet
and
you
could
not
get
a
more
respectable
matron
than
lady
maclaughlan
i
hope
harry
wont
take
it
amiss
if
sir
sampson
does
not
pay
him
so
much
attention
as
he
might
expect
but
he
says
that
he
will
not
be
master
of
a
moment
of
his
own
time
in
london
he
will
be
so
much
taken
up
with
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
that
he
is
afraid
he
will
disoblige
a
great
number
of
the
nobility
by
it
besides
injuring
his
own
health
by
such
constant
application
to
business
he
is
to
make
a
very
fine
speech
in
parliament
but
it
is
not
yet
fixed
what
his
first
motion
is
to
be
upon
he
himself
wishes
to
move
for
a
new
subsidy
to
the
emperor
of
germany
but
lady
maclaughlan
is
of
opinion
that
it
would
be
better
to
bring
in
a
bill
for
building
a
bridge
over
the
water
of
dlin
which
to
be
sure
is
very
much
wanted
as
a
horse
and
cart
were
drowned
at
the
ford
last
speat
we
are
all
i
am
happy
to
say
in
excellent
health
becky
is
recovering
from
the
measles
as
well
as
could
be
wished
and
the
rose
is
quite
gone
out
of
bella
face
beennie
has
been
prevented
from
finishing
a
most
beautiful
pair
of
bottle
sliders
for
your
ladyship
by
a
whitlow
but
it
is
now
mending
and
i
hope
will
be
done
in
time
to
go
with
babby
vase
carpet
which
is
extremely
elegant
by
sir
and
lady
maclaughlan
this
place
is
in
great
beauty
at
present
and
the
new
byre
is
completely
finished
my
sisters
and
i
regret
excessively
that
henry
and
you
should
have
seen
glenfern
to
such
disadvantage
but
when
next
you
favour
us
with
a
visit
i
hope
it
will
be
in
summer
and
the
new
byre
you
will
think
a
prodigious
improvement
our
dear
little
is
in
great
health
and
much
improved
we
reckon
her
extremely
like
our
family
particularly
becky
though
she
has
a
great
look
of
bella
at
the
same
time
then
she
laughs
excuse
the
shortness
of
this
letter
my
dear
niece
as
i
shall
write
a
much
longer
one
by
lady
maclaughlan
erysipelas
meantime
i
remain
my
dear
lady
juliana
yours
and
henry
most
affect
aunt
grizzel
douglas
in
spite
of
her
husband
remonstrance
lady
juliana
persisted
in
her
resolution
of
attending
her
masked
ball
from
which
she
returned
worn
out
with
amusement
and
surfeited
with
pleasure
protesting
all
the
while
she
dawdled
over
her
evening
breakfast
the
following
day
that
there
was
nobody
in
the
world
so
much
to
be
envied
as
lady
lindore
such
jewels
such
dresses
such
a
house
such
a
husband
so
easy
and
and
rich
and
generous
she
was
sure
lindore
did
not
care
what
his
wife
did
she
might
give
what
parties
she
pleased
go
where
she
liked
spend
as
much
money
as
she
chose
and
he
would
never
trouble
his
head
about
the
matter
she
was
quite
certain
lady
lindore
had
not
a
single
thing
to
wish
for
must
be
the
happiest
woman
in
the
world
all
this
was
addressed
to
henry
who
had
however
attained
the
happy
art
of
not
hearing
above
one
word
out
of
a
hundred
that
happened
to
fall
from
the
angel
lips
of
his
adored
julia
and
having
finished
the
newspapers
and
made
himself
acquainted
with
all
the
thoroughbred
and
brood
mares
therein
set
forth
with
a
yawn
and
whistle
sauntered
away
to
g
to
look
at
the
last
regulation
epaulettes
not
long
after
as
lady
juliana
was
stepping
into
the
carriage
that
was
to
whirl
her
to
bond
street
she
was
met
by
her
husband
who
with
a
solemnity
of
manner
that
would
have
startled
anyone
but
his
volatile
lady
requested
she
would
return
with
him
into
the
house
as
he
wished
to
converse
with
her
upon
a
subject
of
some
importance
he
prevailed
on
her
to
return
upon
condition
that
he
would
not
detain
her
above
five
minutes
when
shutting
the
drawing
room
doors
he
said
with
earnestness
i
think
julia
you
were
talking
of
lady
lindore
this
morning
oblige
me
by
repeating
what
you
said
as
i
was
reading
the
papers
and
really
did
not
attend
much
to
what
passed
her
ladyship
in
extreme
surprise
wondered
how
harry
could
be
so
tiresome
and
absurd
as
to
stop
her
airing
for
any
such
purpose
she
really
did
not
know
what
she
said
how
could
she
it
was
more
than
an
hour
ago
well
then
say
what
you
think
of
her
now
cried
douglas
impatiently
think
of
her
why
what
all
the
world
must
think
that
she
is
the
happiest
woman
in
it
she
looked
so
uncommonly
well
last
night
and
was
in
such
spirits
in
her
fancy
dress
before
she
masked
after
that
i
quite
lost
sight
of
her
as
everyone
else
has
done
she
has
not
been
seen
since
her
favourite
leger
is
missing
too
and
there
is
hardly
a
doubt
but
that
they
are
gone
off
together
even
lady
juliana
was
shocked
at
this
intelligence
though
the
folly
more
than
the
wickedness
of
the
thing
seemed
to
strike
her
mind
but
henry
was
no
nice
observer
and
was
therefore
completely
satisfied
with
the
disapprobation
she
expressed
for
her
conduct
i
am
so
sorry
for
poor
dear
lindore
said
lady
juliana
after
having
exhausted
herself
in
invectives
against
his
wife
such
a
generous
creature
as
he
to
be
used
in
such
a
manner
it
is
quite
shocking
to
think
of
it
if
he
had
been
an
stingy
wretch
it
would
have
been
nothing
but
frederick
is
such
a
fellow
i
dare
say
he
would
give
me
a
thousand
pounds
if
i
were
to
ask
him
for
he
care
about
money
lord
lindore
takes
the
matter
very
coolly
understand
replied
her
husband
but
do
be
alarmed
dear
julia
your
father
has
suffered
a
little
from
the
violence
of
his
feelings
he
has
had
a
sort
of
apoplectic
fit
but
is
not
considered
in
immediate
danger
lady
juliana
burst
into
tears
desired
the
carriage
might
be
put
up
as
she
should
not
go
out
and
even
declared
her
intention
of
abstaining
from
d
assembly
that
evening
henry
warmly
commended
the
extreme
propriety
of
these
measures
and
not
to
be
outdone
in
greatness
of
mind
most
heroically
sent
an
apology
to
a
grand
military
dinner
at
the
duke
of
y
observing
at
the
same
time
that
in
the
present
state
of
the
family
one
or
two
friends
to
a
quiet
family
dinner
was
as
much
as
they
should
be
up
to
chapter
xxiii
i
but
purpose
to
embark
with
thee
on
the
smooth
surface
of
a
summer
sea
while
gentle
zephyrs
play
in
prosp
gales
and
fortune
favour
fills
the
swelling
sails
and
how
long
these
voluntary
sacrifices
to
duty
and
propriety
might
have
been
made
it
would
mot
be
difficult
to
guess
but
lady
approaching
confinement
rendered
her
seclusion
more
and
more
a
matter
of
necessity
and
shortly
after
these
events
took
place
she
presented
her
delighted
husband
with
a
son
henry
lost
no
time
in
announcing
the
birth
of
his
child
to
general
cameron
and
at
the
same
time
requesting
he
would
stand
godfather
and
give
his
name
to
the
child
the
answer
was
as
follows
hort
lodge
berks
dear
henry
by
this
time
twelve
month
i
hope
it
will
be
my
turn
to
communicate
to
you
a
similar
event
in
my
family
to
that
which
your
letter
announces
to
me
as
a
preliminary
step
i
am
just
about
to
march
into
quarters
for
life
with
a
young
woman
daughter
to
my
steward
she
is
healthy
and
of
course
vulgar
since
she
is
no
connoisseur
in
china
and
never
spoke
to
a
in
her
life
your
allowance
will
be
remitted
regularly
from
my
banker
until
the
day
of
my
death
you
will
then
succeed
to
ten
thousand
pounds
secured
to
your
children
which
is
all
you
have
to
expect
from
me
if
after
this
you
think
it
worth
your
while
you
are
very
welcome
to
give
your
son
the
name
of
yours
faithfully
william
cameron
henry
consternation
at
the
contents
of
this
epistle
was
almost
equalled
by
juliana
indignation
the
daughter
of
a
steward
heavens
it
made
her
sick
to
think
of
it
it
was
too
shocking
the
man
ought
to
be
shut
up
henry
ought
to
prevent
him
from
disgracing
his
connexions
in
such
a
manner
there
ought
to
be
a
law
against
old
men
marrying
and
young
ones
too
groaned
douglas
as
he
thought
of
the
debts
he
had
contracted
on
the
faith
and
credit
of
being
the
general
heir
for
with
all
the
sanguine
presumption
of
thoughtless
youth
and
buoyant
spirits
henry
had
no
sooner
found
his
fault
forgiven
than
he
immediately
fancied
it
forgotten
and
himself
completely
restored
to
favour
his
friends
and
the
world
were
of
the
same
opinion
and
as
the
future
possessor
of
immense
wealth
he
found
nothing
so
easy
as
to
borrow
money
and
contract
debts
which
he
now
saw
the
impossibility
of
ever
discharging
still
he
flattered
himself
the
general
might
only
mean
to
frighten
him
or
he
might
relent
or
the
marriage
might
go
off
or
he
might
not
have
any
children
and
with
these
hopes
things
went
on
as
usual
for
some
time
longer
lady
juliana
who
to
do
her
justice
was
not
of
a
more
desponding
character
than
her
husband
had
also
her
stock
of
hopes
and
expectations
always
ready
to
act
upon
she
was
quite
sure
that
if
papa
ever
came
to
his
senses
for
he
had
remained
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
since
the
apoplectic
stroke
he
would
forgive
her
and
take
her
to
live
with
him
now
that
that
vile
lady
lindore
was
gone
or
if
he
should
never
recover
she
was
equally
sure
of
benefiting
by
his
death
for
though
he
had
said
he
was
not
to
leave
her
a
shilling
she
did
not
believe
it
she
was
sure
papa
would
never
do
anything
so
cruel
and
at
any
rate
if
he
did
lindore
was
so
generous
he
would
do
something
very
handsome
for
her
and
so
forth
at
length
the
bubbles
burst
the
same
paper
that
stated
the
marriage
of
general
william
cameron
to
judith
broadcast
spinster
announced
in
all
the
dignity
of
woe
the
death
of
that
most
revered
noble
man
and
eminent
statesman
augustus
earl
of
courtland
in
weak
minds
it
has
generally
been
remarked
that
no
medium
can
be
maintained
where
hope
holds
her
dominion
she
is
too
buoyant
to
be
accompanied
by
her
anchor
and
between
her
and
despair
there
are
no
gradations
desperate
indeed
now
became
the
condition
of
the
misjudging
pair
lady
juliana
name
was
not
even
mentioned
in
her
father
will
and
the
general
marriage
rendered
his
settlements
no
longer
a
secret
in
all
the
horrors
of
desperation
henry
now
found
himself
daily
beset
by
creditors
of
every
description
at
length
the
fatal
blow
came
horses
carriages
everything
they
could
call
their
own
were
seized
the
term
for
which
they
held
the
house
was
expired
and
they
found
themselves
on
the
point
of
being
turned
into
the
street
when
lady
juliana
who
had
been
for
two
days
as
her
woman
expressed
it
of
one
fit
into
another
suddenly
recovered
strength
to
signify
her
desire
of
being
conveyed
to
her
brother
house
a
hackney
coach
was
procured
into
which
the
hapless
victim
of
her
own
follies
was
carried
shuddering
with
disgust
and
accompanied
by
her
children
and
their
attendants
she
was
set
down
at
the
noble
mansion
from
which
she
had
fled
two
years
before
her
brother
whom
she
fortunately
found
at
home
lolling
upon
a
sofa
with
a
new

in

received
her
without
any
marks
of
surprise
said
those
things
happened
every
day
hoped
captain
douglas
would
contrive
to
get
himself
extricated
from
this
slight
embarrassment
and
informed
his
sister
that
she
was
welcome
to
occupy
her
old
apartments
which
had
been
lately
fitted
up
for
lady
lindore
then
ringing
the
bell
he
desired
the
housekeeper
might
show
lady
juliana
upstairs
and
put
the
children
in
the
nursery
mentioned
that
he
generally
dined
at
eight
and
nodding
to
his
sister
as
she
quitted
the
room
returned
to
his
book
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
to
disturb
him
from
it
in
ten
minutes
after
her
entrance
into
courtland
house
lady
juliana
had
made
greater
advances
in
and
than
she
had
done
in
the
whole
nineteen
years
of
her
life
for
she
not
only
perceived
that
out
of
evil
cometh
good
but
was
perfectly
ready
to
admit
that
all
is
for
the
best
and
that
whatever
is
is
right
how
lucky
is
it
for
me
exclaimed
she
to
herself
as
she
surveyed
the
splendid
suite
of
apartments
that
were
destined
for
her
accommodation
how
very
fortunate
that
things
have
turned
out
as
they
have
done
that
lady
lindore
should
have
run
off
and
that
the
marriage
should
have
taken
place
just
at
the
time
of
poor
papa
death
and
in
short
lady
juliana
set
no
bounds
to
her
on
the
happy
turn
of
affairs
which
had
brought
about
this
change
in
her
situation
to
a
heart
not
wholly
devoid
of
feeling
and
a
mind
capable
of
anything
like
reflection
the
desolate
appearance
of
this
magnificent
mansion
would
have
excited
emotions
of
a
very
different
nature
the
apartments
of
the
late
earl
with
their
wide
extended
doors
and
windows
sheeted
furniture
and
air
of
dreary
order
exhibited
that
waste
and
chilling
aspect
which
marks
the
chambers
of
death
and
even
lady
juliana
shuddered
she
knew
not
why
as
she
passed
through
them
those
of
lady
lindore
presented
a
picture
not
less
striking
could
her
thoughtless
successor
have
profited
by
the
lesson
they
offered
here
was
all
that
the
most
capricious
fancy
the
most
boundless
extravagance
the
most
refined
luxury
could
wish
for
or
suggest
the
bedchamber
and
boudoir
were
each
fitted
up
in
a
style
that
seemed
rather
suited
for
the
pleasures
of
an
eastern
sultana
or
grecian
courtesan
than
for
the
domestic
comfort
of
a
british
matron
i
wonder
how
lady
lindore
could
find
in
her
heart
to
leave
this
delicious
boudoir
observed
lady
juliana
to
the
old
housekeeper
i
rather
wonder
my
lady
how
she
could
find
in
her
heart
to
leave
these
pretty
babies
returned
the
good
woman
as
a
little
boy
came
running
into
the
room
calling
mamma
mamma
lady
juliana
had
nothing
to
say
to
children
beyond
a
how
d
do
love
and
the
child
after
regarding
her
for
a
moment
with
a
look
of
disappointment
ran
away
back
to
his
nursery
when
lady
juliana
had
fairly
settled
herself
in
her
new
apartments
and
the
tumult
of
delight
began
to
subside
it
occurred
to
her
that
something
must
be
done
for
poor
harry
whom
she
had
left
in
the
hands
of
a
brother
officer
in
a
state
little
short
of
distraction
she
accordingly
went
in
search
of
her
brother
to
request
his
advice
and
assistance
and
found
him
it
being
nearly
dark
preparing
to
set
out
on
his
morning
ride
upon
hearing
the
situation
of
his
he
declared
himself
ready
to
assist
douglas
as
far
as
he
was
able
but
he
had
just
learned
from
his
people
of
business
that
his
own
affairs
were
somewhat
involved
the
late
earl
had
expended
enormous
sums
on
political
purposes
lady
lindore
had
run
through
a
prodigious
deal
of
money
he
believed
and
he
himself
had
some
debts
amounting
he
was
told
to
seventy
thousand
pounds
lady
juliana
was
all
aghast
at
this
information
which
was
delivered
with
the
most
perfect
by
the
earl
while
he
amused
himself
with
his
newfoundland
dog
unable
to
conceal
her
disappointment
at
these
effects
of
her
brother
liberality
and
generosity
lady
juliana
burst
into
tears
the
earl
sensibility
was
akin
to
his
generosity
he
gave
money
or
rather
allowed
it
to
be
taken
freely
when
he
had
it
from
indolence
and
easiness
of
temper
he
hated
the
sight
of
distress
in
any
individual
because
it
occasioned
trouble
and
was
in
short
a
therefore
made
haste
to
relieve
his
sister
alarm
by
assuring
her
that
these
were
mere
trifles
that
as
for
douglas
affairs
he
would
order
his
agent
to
arrange
everything
in
his
name
hoped
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
at
dinner
recommended
to
his
sister
to
have
some
pheasant
pies
for
luncheon
and
calling
carlo
set
out
upon
his
ride
however
much
lady
juliana
had
felt
mortified
and
disappointed
at
learning
the
state
of
her
brother
finances
she
began
by
degrees
to
extract
the
greatest
consolation
from
the
comparative
insignificance
of
her
own
debts
to
those
of
the
earl
and
accordingly
in
high
spirits
at
this
newly
discovered
and
judicious
source
of
comfort
she
despatched
the
following
note
to
her
husband
dearest
henry
i
have
been
received
in
the
kindest
manner
imaginable
by
frederick
and
have
been
put
in
possession
of
my
old
apartments
which
are
so
much
altered
i
should
never
have
known
them
they
were
furnished
by
lady
lindore
who
really
has
a
divine
taste
i
long
to
show
you
all
the
delights
of
this
abode
frederick
desired
me
to
say
that
he
expects
to
see
you
here
at
dinner
and
that
he
will
take
charge
of
paying
all
our
bills
whenever
he
gets
money
only
think
of
his
owing
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
besides
all
papa
and
lady
debts
i
assure
you
i
was
almost
ashamed
to
tell
him
of
ours
they
sounded
so
trifling
but
it
is
quite
a
relief
to
find
other
people
so
much
worse
indeed
i
always
thought
it
quite
natural
for
us
to
run
in
debt
considering
that
we
had
no
money
to
pay
anything
while
courtland
who
is
as
rich
as
a
jew
is
so
hampered
i
shall
expect
you
at
eight
until
when
adieu
your
julie
i
am
quite
wretched
about
you
this
tender
and
consolatory
billet
henry
had
not
the
satisfaction
of
receiving
having
been
arrested
shortly
after
his
wife
departure
at
the
suit
of
shagg
for
the
sum
of
two
thousand
some
odd
hundreds
for
carriages
jobbed
bought
exchanged
repaired
returned
etc
lady
juliana
horror
and
dismay
at
the
news
of
her
husband
arrest
were
excessive
her
only
ideas
of
confinement
were
taken
from
those
pictures
of
the
bastile
and
inquisition
that
she
had
read
so
much
of
in
french
and
german
novels
and
the
idea
of
a
prison
was
indissolubly
united
in
her
mind
with
bread
and
water
chains
and
straw
dungeons
and
darkness
callous
and
selfish
therefore
as
she
might
be
she
was
not
yet
so
wholly
void
of
all
natural
feeling
as
to
think
with
indifference
of
the
man
she
had
once
fondly
loved
reduced
to
such
a
pitiable
condition
almost
frantic
at
the
phantom
of
her
own
creation
she
flew
to
her
brother
apartment
and
in
the
wildest
and
most
incoherent
manner
besought
him
to
rescue
her
poor
henry
from
chains
and
a
dungeon
with
some
difficulty
lord
courtland
at
length
apprehended
the
extent
of
his
misfortune
and
with
his
usual
smiled
at
his
sister
simplicity
assured
her
the
king
bench
was
the
pleasantest
place
in
the
world
that
some
of
his
own
most
particular
friends
were
there
who
gave
capital
dinners
and
led
the
most
desirable
lives
imaginable
and
will
he
really
not
be
fed
on
bread
and
water
and
wear
chains
and
sleep
upon
straw
asked
the
tender
wife
in
the
utmost
surprise
and
delight
oh
then
he
is
not
so
much
to
be
pitied
though
i
dare
say
he
would
rather
get
out
of
prison
too
the
earl
promised
to
obtain
his
release
the
following
day
and
lady
juliana
returned
to
her
toilet
with
a
much
higher
opinion
of
prisons
than
she
had
ever
entertained
before
lord
courtland
for
once
in
his
life
was
punctual
to
his
promise
and
even
interested
himself
so
thoroughly
in
douglas
affairs
though
without
inquiring
into
any
particulars
as
to
take
upon
himself
the
discharge
of
his
debts
and
to
procure
leave
for
him
to
exchange
into
a
regiment
of
the
line
then
under
orders
for
india
upon
hearing
of
this
arrangement
lady
juliana
grief
and
despair
as
usual
set
all
reason
at
defiance
she
would
not
suffer
her
dear
dear
harry
to
leave
her
she
knew
she
could
not
live
without
him
she
was
sure
she
should
die
and
harry
would
be
sea
sick
and
grow
so
yellow
and
so
ugly
that
when
he
came
back
she
should
never
have
any
comfort
in
him
again
henry
who
had
never
doubted
her
readiness
to
accompany
him
immediately
hastened
to
assuage
her
anguish
by
assuring
her
that
it
had
always
been
his
intention
to
take
her
along
with
him
that
was
worse
and
worse
she
wondered
how
he
could
be
so
barbarous
and
absurd
as
to
think
of
her
leaving
all
her
friends
and
going
to
live
amongst
savages
she
had
done
a
great
deal
in
living
so
long
contentedly
with
him
in
scotland
but
she
never
could
nor
would
make
such
another
sacrifice
besides
she
was
sure
poor
courtland
could
not
do
without
her
she
knew
he
never
would
marry
again
and
who
would
take
care
of
his
dear
children
and
educate
them
properly
if
she
did
not
it
would
be
too
ungrateful
to
desert
frederick
after
all
he
had
done
for
them
the
pride
of
the
man
as
much
as
the
affection
of
the
husband
was
irritated
by
this
resistance
to
this
will
and
a
violent
scene
of
reproach
and
recrimination
terminated
in
an
eternal
farewell

young
the
neglected
daughter
of
lady
juliana
douglas
experienced
all
the
advantages
naturally
to
be
expected
from
her
change
of
situation
her
watchful
aunt
superintended
the
years
of
her
infancy
and
all
that
a
tender
and
judicious
mother
do
all
that
most
mothers
they
do
she
performed
douglas
though
not
a
woman
either
of
words
or
systems
possessed
a
reflecting
mind
and
a
heart
warm
with
benevolence
towards
everything
that
had
a
being
and
all
the
best
feelings
of
her
nature
were
excited
by
the
little
outcast
thus
abandoned
by
her
unnatural
parent
as
she
pressed
the
unconscious
babe
to
her
bosom
she
thought
how
blest
she
should
have
been
had
a
child
of
her
own
thus
filled
her
arms
but
the
reflection
called
forth
no
selfish
murmurs
from
her
chastened
spirit
while
the
tear
of
soft
regret
trembled
in
her
eye
that
eye
was
yet
raised
in
gratitude
to
heaven
for
having
called
forth
those
delightful
affections
which
might
otherwise
have
slumbered
in
her
heart
douglas
had
read
much
and
reflected
more
and
many
faultless
theories
of
education
had
floated
in
her
mind
but
her
good
sense
soon
discovered
how
unavailing
all
theories
were
whose
foundations
rested
upon
the
inferred
wisdom
of
the
teacher
and
how
intricate
and
unwieldy
must
be
the
machinery
for
the
human
mind
where
the
human
hand
alone
is
to
guide
and
uphold
it
to
engraft
into
her
infant
soul
the
purest
principles
of
religion
was
therefore
the
chief
aim
of
preceptress
the
fear
of
god
was
the
only
restraint
imposed
upon
her
dawning
intellect
and
from
the
bible
alone
was
she
taught
the
duties
of
morality
not
in
the
form
of
a
dry
code
of
laws
to
be
read
with
a
solemn
face
on
sundays
or
learned
with
weeping
eyes
as
a
task
but
adapted
to
her
youthful
capacity
by
judicious
illustration
and
familiarised
to
her
taste
by
hearing
its
stories
and
precepts
from
the
lips
she
best
loved
douglas
was
the
friend
and
confidant
of
her
pupil
to
her
all
her
hopes
and
fears
wishes
and
dreads
were
confided
and
the
first
effort
of
her
reason
was
the
discovery
that
to
please
her
aunt
she
must
study
to
please
her
maker
de
la
vie
des
femmes
est
la
premier
source
de
leurs
désordres
douglas
was
fully
convinced
of
the
truth
of
this
observation
and
that
the
mere
selfish
cares
and
vulgar
bustle
of
life
are
not
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
immortal
soul
however
they
may
serve
to
engross
it
a
portion
of
mary
time
was
therefore
devoted
to
the
daily
practice
of
the
great
duties
of
life
in
administering
in
some
shape
or
other
to
the
wants
and
misfortunes
of
her
without
requiring
from
them
that
their
virtue
should
have
been
immaculate
or
expecting
that
their
gratitude
should
be
everlasting
it
is
better
thought
douglas
that
we
should
sometimes
be
deceived
by
others
than
that
we
should
learn
to
deceive
ourselves
and
the
charity
and
goodwill
that
is
suffered
to
lie
dormant
or
feed
itself
on
speculative
acts
of
beneficence
for
want
of
proper
objects
to
call
it
into
use
will
soon
become
the
corroding
rust
that
will
destroy
the
best
feelings
of
our
nature
but
although
mary
strenuously
applied
herself
to
the
uses
of
life
its
embellishments
were
by
no
means
neglected
she
was
happily
endowed
by
nature
and
under
the
judicious
management
of
her
aunt
made
rapid
though
unostentatious
progress
in
the
improvement
of
the
talents
committed
to
her
care
without
having
been
blessed
with
the
advantages
of
a
dancing
master
her
step
was
light
and
her
motions
free
and
graceful
and
if
her
aunt
had
not
been
able
to
impart
to
her
the
favourite
graces
of
the
most
fashionable
singer
of
the
day
neither
had
she
thwarted
the
efforts
of
her
own
natural
taste
in
forming
a
style
full
of
simplicity
and
feeling
in
the
modern
languages
she
was
perfectly
skilled
and
if
her
drawings
wanted
the
enlivening
touches
of
the
master
to
give
them
effect
as
an
atonement
they
displayed
a
perfect
knowledge
of
the
rules
of
perspective
and
the
study
of
the
bust
all
this
was
however
mere
leather
and
prunella
to
the
ladies
of
glenfern
and
many
were
the
cogitations
and
consultations
that
took
place
n
the
subject
of
mary
mismanagement
according
to
their
ideas
there
could
be
but
one
good
system
of
education
and
that
was
the
one
that
had
been
pursued
with
them
and
through
them
transmitted
to
their
nieces
to
attend
the
parish
church
and
remember
the
text
to
observe
who
was
there
and
who
was
there
and
to
wind
up
the
evening
with
a
sermon
stuttered
and
stammered
through
by
one
of
the
girls
the
worst

always
piously
selected
for
the

improving
their
reading

particularly
addressed

at

pause
starting
up
with
a
peevish

this
was
the
sum
total
of
their
religious
duties
their
moral
virtues
were
much
upon
the
same
scale
to
knit
stockings
scold
servants
cement
china
trim
bonnets
lecture
the
poor
and
look
up
to
lady
maclaughlan
comprise
nearly
their
whole
code
but
these
were
the
virtues
of
ripened
years
and
enlarged
understandings
which
their
pupils
might
hope
to
arrive
at
but
could
not
presume
to
meddle
with

in
being
compelled
to
sew
certain
large
portions
of

to

learning
the

these
acquirements
accompanied
with
a
great
deal
of
lecturing
and
sufficed
for
the
first
fifteen
years

supposed
to

graceful

may
easily
be

did
not
square
with
their
ideas
on
that
subject
they
did
nothing
themselves
without
a
bustle
and
to
do
a
thing
quietly
was
to
them
the
same
as
not
doing
it
at
all
it
could
not
be
done
for
nobody
had
ever
heard
of
it
in
short
like
many
other
worthy
people
their
ears
were
their
only
organs
of
intelligence
they
believed
everything
they
were
told
but
unless
they
were
told
they
believed
nothing
they
had
never
heard
douglas
expatiate
on
the
importance
of
the
trust
reposed
in
her
or
enlarge
on
the
difficulties
of
female
education
douglas
could
have
no
idea
of
the
nature
of
the
duties
she
had
undertaken
their
visits
to
lochmarlie
only
served
to
confirm
the
fact
miss
jacky
deponed
that
during
the
month
she
was
there
she
never
could
discover
when
or
how
it
was
that
mary
got
her
lessons
luckily
the
child
was
quick
and
had
contrived
poor
thing
to
pick
up
things
wonderfully
nobody
knew
how
for
it
was
really
astonishing
to
see
how
little
pains
were
bestowed
upon
her
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
she
seemed
to
do
just
as
she
liked
for
nobody
ever
heard
her
reproved
and
everybody
knew
that
young
people
never
could
have
enough
said
to
them
all
this
differed
widely
from
the
éclat
of
their
system
and
could
not
fail
of
causing
great
disquiet
to
the
sisters
i
declare
i
quite
confounded
at
all
this
said
miss
grizzy
at
the
conclusion
of
miss
jacky
communication
it
really
appears
as
if
mary
poor
thing
was
getting
no
education
at
all
and
yet
she
do
things
too
i
ca
understand
it
and
it
very
odd
in
douglas
to
allow
her
to
be
so
much
neglected
for
certainly
mary
constantly
with
herself
which
to
be
sure
shows
that
she
is
very
much
spoilt
for
although
our
girls
are
as
fond
of
us
as
i
am
sure
any
creatures
can
be
yet
at
the
same
time
they
are
always
very
glad
which
is
quite
natural
to
run
away
from
us
i
think
it
high
time
mary
had
done
something
fit
to
be
seen
said
miss
nicky
she
is
now
sixteen
past
most
girls
of
mary
time
of
life
that
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
replied
jacky
with
a
certain
wave
of
the
head
peculiar
to
sensible
women
had
something
to
show
before
her
age
bella
had
worked
the
globe
long
before
she
was
sixteen
and
baby
did
her
filigree
the
first
quarter
she
was
at
miss
macgowk
glancing
with
triumph
from
the
one
which
hung
over
the
mantelpiece
to
the
other
which
stood
on
the
shrouded
in
a
green
bag
and
to
be
sure
rejoined
grizzy
although
betsy
screen
did
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
that
ca
be
denied
and
her
father
certainly
grudged
it
very
much
at
the
time
there
no
doubt
of
that
yet
certainly
it
does
her
the
greatest
credit
and
it
is
a
great
satisfaction
to
us
all
to
have
these
things
to
show
i
am
sure
nobody
would
ever
think
that
ass
was
made
of
crape
and
how
naturally
it
seems
to
be
eating
the
beautiful
chenille
thistle
i
declare
i
think
the
ass
is
as
like
an
ass
as
anything
can
be
and
as
to
mary
drawing
continued
the
narrator
of
her
deficiencies
there
is
not
one
of
them
fit
for
framing
mere
scratches
with
a
chalk
pencil
what
any
child
might
do
and
to
think
said
nicky
with
indignation
how
little
douglas
seemed
to
think
of
the
handsome
coloured
views
the
girls
did
at
miss
macgowk
all
our
girls
have
the
greatest
genius
for
drawing
observed
grizzy
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
that
but
it
a
thousand
pities
i
sure
that
none
of
them
seem
to
like
it
to
be
sure
they
say
what
i
daresay
is
very
true
that
they
ca
get
such
good
paper
as
they
got
at
miss
macgowk
but
they
have
showed
that
they
for
their
drawings
are
quite
astonishing
somebody
lately
took
them
to
be
touchup
own
doing
and
i
sure
there
could
be
a
greater
compliment
than
that
i
represented
all
that
to
douglas
and
urged
her
very
strongly
to
give
mary
the
benefit
of
at
least
a
quarter
of
miss
macgowk
were
it
only
for
the
sake
of
her
carriage
or
at
least
to
make
her
wear
our
collar
this
was
the
tenderest
of
all
themes
and
bursts
of
sorrowful
exclamations
ensued
the
collar
had
long
been
a
galling
yoke
upon
their
minds
it
iron
had
entered
into
their
very
souls
for
it
was
a
collar
presented
to
the
family
of
glenfern
by
the
wisest
virtuousest
best
of
women
and
of
grandmothers
the
the
good
lady
girnachgowl
and
had
been
worn
in
regular
rotation
by
every
female
of
the
family
till
now
that
douglas
positively
refused
to
subject
mary
pliant
form
to
its
thraldom
even
the
laird
albeit
no
connoisseur
in
any
shapes
save
those
of
his
kine
was
of
opinion
that
since
the
thing
was
in
the
house
it
was
a
pity
it
should
be
lost
not
venus
girdle
even
was
supposed
to
confer
greater
charms
than
the
girnachgowl
collar
it
really
most
distressing
said
miss
grizzy
to
her
friend
lady
maclaughlan
mary
back
wo
be
worth
a
farthing
and
we
have
always
been
quite
famous
for
our
back
humph
that
the
reason
people
are
always
so
glad
to
see
them
child
with
regard
to
mary
looks
opinions
were
not
so
decided
douglas
thought
her
what
she
was
an
elegant
girl
the
laird
as
he
peered
at
her
over
his
spectacles
pronounced
her
to
be
but
a
shilpit
thing
though
weel
eneugh
considering
the
that
were
aught
her
miss
jacky
opined
that
she
would
have
been
quite
a
different
creature
had
she
been
brought
up
like
any
other
girl
miss
grizzy
did
not
know
what
to
think
she
certainly
was
pretty
nobody
could
dispute
that
at
the
same
time
many
people
would
prefer
looks
and
baby
was
certainly
uncommonly
comely
miss
nicky
thought
it
was
no
wonder
she
looked
pale
sometimes
she
never
supped
her
broth
in
a
wiselike
way
at
dinner
and
it
was
a
shame
to
hear
of
a
girl
of
age
being
set
up
with
tea
to
her
breakfast
and
wearing
white
petticoats
in
winter
and
such
roads
too
lady
maclaughlan
pronounced
and
that
was
next
to
a
special
revelation
that
the
girl
would
be
handsome
when
she
was
forty
not
a
day
sooner
and
she
would
be
clever
for
her
mother
was
a
fool
and
foolish
mothers
had
always
wise
children
and
versa
and
your
mother
was
a
very
clever
woman
girls
humph
thus
passed
the
early
years
of
the
almost
forgotten
twin
blest
in
the
warm
affection
and
mild
authority
of
her
more
than
mother
sometimes
douglas
half
formed
the
wish
that
her
beloved
pupil
should
mix
in
society
and
become
known
to
the
world
but
when
she
reflected
on
the
dangers
of
that
world
and
on
the
little
solid
happiness
its
pleasures
afford
she
repressed
the
wish
and
only
prayed
she
might
be
allowed
to
rest
secure
in
the
simple
pleasures
she
then
enjoyed
happiness
is
not
a
plant
of
this
earth
said
she
to
herself
with
a
sigh
but
god
gives
peace
and
tranquillity
to
the
virtuous
in
all
situations
and
under
every
trial
let
me
then
strive
to
make
mary
virtuous
and
leave
the
rest
to
him
who
alone
knoweth
what
is
good
for
us
chapter

th

dryden
we
are
such
stuff
as
dreams
are

on

our
little

is
rounded
with
a
sleep
but
mary
back
and
mary
complexion
now
ceased
to
be
the
first
objects
of
interest
at
glenfern
for
to
the
inexpressible
delight
and
amazement
of
the
sisters
douglas
after
due
warning
became
the
mother
of
a
son
how
this
event
had
been
brought
about
without
the
intervention
of
lady
maclaughlan
was
past
the
powers
of
miss
comprehension
to
the
last
moment
they
had
been
sceptical
for
lady
maclaughlan
had
shook
her
head
and
humphed
whenever
the
subject
was
mentioned
for
several
months
they
had
therefore
vibrated
between
their
own
sanguine
hopes
and
their
oracle
disheartening
doubts
and
even
when
the
truth
was
manifest
a
sort
of
vague
tremor
took
possession
of
their
mind
as
to
what
lady
maclaughlan
would
think
of
it
i
declare
i
do
very
well
know
how
to
announce
this
happy
event
to
lady
maclaughlan
said
miss
grizzy
as
she
sat
in
a
ruminating
posture
with
her
pen
in
her
hand
it
will
give
her
the
greatest
pleasure
i
know
that
she
has
such
a
regard
for
our
family
she
would
go
any
lengths
for
us
at
the
same
time
everybody
must
be
sensible
it
is
a
delicate
matter
to
tell
a
person
of
lady
maclaughlan
skill
they
have
been
mistaken
i
sure
i
do
know
how
she
may
take
it
and
yet
she
ca
suppose
it
will
make
any
difference
in
our
sentiments
for
her
she
must
be
sensible
we
have
all
the
greatest
respect
for
her
opinion
the
wisest
people
are
sometimes
mistaken
observed
miss
jacky
i
sure
jacky
that
very
true
said
grizzy
brightening
up
at
the
brilliancy
of
this
remark
and
it
better
she
should
have
been
mistaken
than
douglas
followed
up
miss
nicky
i
declare
nicky
you
are
perfectly
right
and
i
shall
just
say
so
at
once
to
lady
maclaughlan
the
epistle
was
forthwith
commenced
by
the
enlightened
grizelda
miss
joan
applied
herself
to
the
study
of
the
whole
duty
of
man
which
she
was
determined
to
make
herself
mistress
of
for
the
benefit
of
her
and
miss
nicholas
fell
to
reckoning
all
who
could
would
or
should
be
at
the
christening
that
she
might
calculate
upon
the
quantity
of
that
would
be
required
the
younger
ladies
were
busily
engaged
in
divers
and
sundry
disputes
regarding
the
right
to
succession
to
a
lutestring
negligee
of
their
mother
which
three
of
them
had
laid
their
accounts
with
figuring
in
at
the
approaching
celebration
the
old
gentleman
was
the
only
one
in
the
family
who
took
the
least
of
the
general
happiness
he
had
got
into
a
habit
of
being
fretted
about
everything
that
happened
and
he
could
not
entirely
divest
himself
of
it
even
upon
this
occasion
his
parsimonious
turns
too
had
considerably
increased
and
his
only
criterion
of
judging
of
anything
was
according
to
what
it
would
bring
sorra
tak
me
if
ane
wadnae
think
to
hear
ye
this
was
the
first
bairn
that
was
born
the
fraize
aboot
ye
gowks
to
his
daughters
a
whingin
get
that
tak
mail
oot
o

into
them
mony
a
guid
profitable
beast
been
brought
into
the
warld
and
a
word
in
heed
all
went
on
smoothly
lady
maclaughlan
testified
no
resentment
miss
jacky
had
the
the
whole
duty
of
man
at
her
and
miss
nicky
was
not
more
severe
than
could
have
been
expected
considering
as
she
did
how
the
servants
at
lochmarlie
must
be
living
at
hack
and
manger
it
had
been
decided
at
glenfern
that
the
infant
heir
to
its
consequence
could
not
with
propriety
be
christened
any
where
but
at
the
seat
of
his
forefathers
and
douglas
had
yielded
the
point
and
as
soon
as
she
was
able
for
the
change
the
whole
family
took
up
their
residence
for
a
season
under
the
paternal
roof
blissful
visions
floated
around
the
pillows
of
the
happy
spinsters
the
night
preceding
the
christening
which
were
duly
detailed
at
the
the
following
morning
i
declare
i
do
know
what
to
think
of
my
dream
began
miss
grizzy
i
dreamt
that
lady
maclaughlan
was
upon
her
knees
to
you
brother
to
get
you
to
take
an
emetic
and
just
as
she
had
mixed
it
up
so
nicely
in
some
of
our
jelly
little
norman
snatched
it
out
of
your
hand
and
ran
away
with
it
you
eneugh
to
turn
onybody
stamick
nonsense
returned
the
laird
gruffly
and
i
said
miss
jacky
thought
i
saw
you
standing
in
your
shirt
brother
as
straight
as
a
rash
and
good
lady
girnachgowl
buckling
her
collar
upon
you
with
her
own
hands
i
wish
ye
wadna
deive
me
wi
your
havels
still
more
indignantly
and
turning
his
shoulder
to
the
fair
dreamer
as
he
continued
to
con
over
the
newspaper
and
i
cried
miss
nicky
eager
to
get
her
mystic
tale
disclosed
i
thought
brother
i
saw
you
take
and
throw
all
the
good
into
the
by
my
troth
an
ye
deserve
to
be
thrown
exclaimed
the
exasperated
laird
as
he
quitted
the
room
in
high
wrath
muttering
to
himself
hard
case
canna
get
peace
eat
my
vittals
fules
tawpies
clavers
etc
etc
i
declare
i
ca
conceive
why
glenfern
should
be
so
ill
pleased
at
our
dreams
said
miss
grizzy
everybody
knows
dreams
are
always
contrary
and
even
were
it
otherwise
i
sure
i
should
think
no
shame
to
take
an
emetic
especially
when
lady
maclaughlan
was
at
the
trouble
of
mixing
it
up
so
nicely
and
we
have
all
worn
good
lady
girnachgowl
collar
before
now
said
miss
jacky
i
think
i
had
the
worst
of
it
that
had
all
my
good
destroyed
added
mis
nicky
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
you
dreams
said
douglas
considering
how
all
these
subjects
have
engrossed
you
for
some
time
past
you
aunt
grizzy
may
remember
how
desirous
you
were
of
administering
one
of
lady
maclaughlan
powders
to
my
little
boy
yesterday
and
you
aunt
jacky
made
a
point
of
trying
lady
girnachgowl
collar
upon
mary
to
convince
her
how
pleasant
it
was
while
you
aunt
nicky
had
experienced
a
great
alarm
in
supposing
your
cake
had
been
burned
in
the
oven
and
these
being
the
most
vivid
impression
you
had
received
during
the
day
it
was
perfectly
natural
that
they
should
have
retained
their
influence
during
a
portion
of
the
night
the
interpretations
were
received
with
high
disdain
one
and
all
declared
they
never
dreamed
of
anything
that
occurred
and
therefore
the
visions
of
the
night
portended
some
extraordinary
good
fortune
to
the
family
in
general
and
to
little
norman
in
particular
the
best
fortune
i
can
wish
for
him
and
all
of
us
for
this
day
is
that
he
should
remain
quiet
during
the
ceremony
said
his
mother
who
was
not
so
elated
as
lady
macbeth
at
the
predictions
of
the
sisters
the
christening
party
mustered
strong
and
the
rites
of
baptism
were
duly
performed
by
the
rev
duncan
the
little
christian
had
been
kissed
by
every
lady
in
company
and
pronounced
by
the
matrons
to
be
a
dainty
little
and
by
the
misses
to
be
the
sweetest
lamb
they
had
ever
seen
the
cake
and
wine
was
in
its
progress
round
the
company
when
upon
its
being
tendered
to
the
old
gentleman
who
was
sitting
silent
in
his
he
abruptly
exclaimed
in
a
most
discordant
voice
hey
what
a
this
wastery
for
and
ere
an
answer
could
be
returned
his
jaw
dropped
his
eyes
fixed
and
the
laird
of
glenfern
ceased
to
breathe
chapter
xxvi
they
say
miracles
are
past
and
we
have
our
philosophical
persons
to
make
modern
and
familiar
things
supernatural
and
causeless
hence
it
is
that
we
make
trifles
of
terrors
ensconcing
ourselves
into
seeming
knowledge
when
we
should
submit
ourselves
to
an
unknown
fear
well
that
ends
all
attempts
to
reanimate
the
lifeless
form
proved
unavailing
and
the
horror
and
consternation
that
reigned
in
the
castle
of
glenfern
may
be
imagined
but
can
not
be
described
there
is
perhaps
no
feeling
of
our
nature
so
vague
so
complicated
so
mysterious
as
that
with
which
we
look
upon
the
cold
remains
of
our
the
dignity
with
which
death
invests
even
the
meanest
of
his
victims
inspires
us
with
an
awe
no
living
thing
can
create
the
monarch
on
his
throne
is
less
awful
than
the
beggar
in
his
shroud
the
marble
features
the
powerless
hand
the
stiffened
limbs
oh
who
can
contemplate
these
with
feelings
that
can
be
defined
these
are
the
mockery
of
all
our
hopes
and
fears
our
fondest
love
our
fellest
hate
can
it
be
that
we
now
shrink
with
horror
from
the
touch
of
that
hand
which
but
yesterday
was
fondly
clasped
in
our
own
is
that
tongue
whose
accents
even
now
dwell
in
our
ear
forever
chained
in
the
silence
of
death
these
black
and
heavy
eyelids
are
they
for
ever
to
seal
up
in
darkness
the
eyes
whose
glance
no
earthly
power
could
restrain
and
the
spirit
which
animated
the
clay
where
is
it
now
is
it
wrapt
in
bliss
or
dissolved
in
woe
does
it
witness
our
grief
and
share
our
sorrows
or
is
the
mysterious
tie
that
linked
it
with
mortality
forever
broken
and
the
remembrance
of
earthly
scenes
are
they
indeed
to
the
enfranchised
spirit
as
the
morning
dream
or
the
dew
upon
the
early
flower
reflections
such
as
these
naturally
arise
in
every
breast
their
influence
is
felt
though
their
import
can
not
always
be
expressed
the
principle
is
in
all
the
same
however
it
may
differ
in
its
operations
in
the
family
assembled
round
the
lifeless
form
that
had
so
long
been
the
centre
of
their
domestic
circle
grief
showed
itself
under
various
forms
the
calm
and
manly
sorrow
of
the
son
the
feelings
of
his
wife
the
youthful
agitation
of
mary
the
weak
superstitious
wailings
of
the
sisters
and
the
loud
uncontrolled
lamentations
of
the
daughters
all
betokened
an
intensity
of
suffering
that
arose
from
the
same
source
varied
according
to
the
different
channels
in
which
it
flowed
even
the
stern
lady
maclaughlan
was
subdued
to
something
of
kindred
feeling
and
though
no
tears
dropped
from
her
eyes
she
sat
by
her
friends
and
sought
in
her
own
way
to
soften
their
affliction
the
assembled
guests
who
had
not
yet
been
able
to
take
their
departure
remained
in
the
in
a
sort
of
restless
solemnity
peculiar
to
seasons
of
collateral
affliction
where
all
seek
to
highten
the
effect
upon
others
and
shift
the
lesson
from
themselves
various
were
the
surmises
and
speculations
as
to
the
cause
of
the
awful
transition
that
had
just
taken
place

he

the
very
day
that
glenfern
be
laid
in
his
deal
coffin
the
company
admitted
the
application
was
too
close
to
be
resisted
but
the
same
sceptic
who
was
only
a
low
country
merchant
elevated
by
purchase
to
the
dignity
of
a
highland
laird
was
seen
to
shrug
his
shoulders
and
hear
to
make
some
sneering
remarks
on
the
days
of
and
such
superstitious
nonsense
being
past
this
was
instantly
laid
hold
of
and
amongst
many
others
of
the
same
sort
the
truth
of
the
following
story
was
attested
by
one
of
the
party
as
having
actually
occurred
in
his
family
within
his
own
remembrance
as
duncan
was
one
evening
descending
benvoilloich
he
perceived
a
funeral
procession
in
the
vale
beneath
he
was
greatly
surprised
not
having
heard
of
any
death
in
the
country
and
this
appeared
to
be
the
burial
of
some
person
of
consequence
from
the
number
of
the
attendants
he
made
all
the
haste
he
could
to
get
down
and
as
he
drew
near
the
counted
all
the
lairds
of
the
country
except
my
father
sir
murdoch
he
was
astonished
at
this
till
he
recollected
that
he
was
away
to
the
low
country
to
his
cousin
marriage
but
he
felt
curious
to
know
who
it
was
though
some
unaccountable
feeling
prevented
him
from
mixing
with
the
followers
he
therefore
kept
on
the
ridge
of
the
hill
right
over
their
heads
and
near
enough
to
hear
them
speak
but
although
he
saw
them
move
their
lips
no
sound
reached
his
ear
he
kept
along
with
the
procession
in
this
way
till
it
reached
the
castle
dochart
and
there
it
stopped
the
evening
was
close
and
warm
and
a
thick
mist
had
gathered
in
the
glen
while
the
tops
of
the
hills
shone
like
gold
not
a
breath
of
air
was
stirring
but
the
trees
that
grew
round
the
waved
and
soughed
and
some
withered
leaves
were
swirled
round
and
round
as
if
by
the
wind
the
company
stood
a
while
to
rest
and
then
they
proceeded
to
open
the
iron
gates
of
the
but
the
lock
was
rusted
and
would
not
open
then
they
began
to
pull
down
part
of
the
wall
and
duncan
thought
how
angry
his
master
would
be
at
this
and
he
raised
his
voice
and
shouted
and
hallooed
to
them
but
to
no
purpose
nobody
seemed
to
hear
him
at
last
the
wall
was
taken
down
and
the
coffin
was
lifted
over
and
just
then
the
sun
broke
out
and
glinted
on
a
grave
and
as
they
were
laying
the
coffin
in
it
it
gave
way
and
disclosed
sir
murdoch
himself
in
his
dead
clothes
and
then
the
mist
grew
so
thick
duncan
could
see
no
more
and
how
to
get
home
he
knew
not
but
when
he
entered
his
own
door
he
was
bathed
in
sweat
and
white
as
any
corpse
and
all
that
he
could
say
was
that
he
had
seen
castle
dochart
burying
the
following
day
continued
the
narrator
he
was
more
composed
and
gave
the
account
you
have
now
heard
and
three
days
after
came
the
intelligence
of
my
father
death
he
had
dropped
down
in
a
fit
that
very
evening
when
entertaining
a
large
company
in
honour
of
his
cousin
marriage
and
that
day
week
his
funeral
passed
through
glenvalloch
exactly
as
described
by
duncan
with
all
the
particulars
the
gates
of
the
could
not
he
opened
part
of
the
wall
was
taken
down
to
admit
the
coffin
which
received
some
injury
and
gave
way
as
they
were
placing
it
in
the
grave
even
the
infidel
was
silenced
by
the
solemnity
of
this
story
and
soon
after
the
company
dispersed
everyone
panting
to
be
the
first
to
circulate
the
intelligence
of
glenfern
death
but
soon
oh
how
soon
dies
in
human
hearts
the
thought
of
death
even
the
paltry
detail
which
death
creates
serves
to
detach
out
minds
from
the
cause
itself
so
it
was
with
the
family
of
glenfern
their
light
did
not
shine
inward
and
after
the
first
burst
of
sorrow
their
ideas
fastened
with
avidity
on
all
the
paraphernalia
of
affliction
douglas
indeed
found
much
to
do
and
to
direct
to
be
done
the
elder
ladies
began
to
calculate
how
many
yards
of
broad
hemming
would
be
required
and
to
form
a
of
the
company
with
this
improvement
that
it
was
to
be
ten
times
as
numerous
as
the
one
that
had
assembled
at
the
christening
while
the
young
ones
busied
their
imaginations
as
to
the
effect
of
new
mournings
a
luxury
to
them
hitherto
unknown
douglas
and
mary
were
differently
affected
religion
and
reflection
had
taught
the
former
the
enviable
lesson
of
possessing
her
soul
in
patience
under
every
trial
and
while
she
inwardly
mourned
the
fate
of
the
poor
old
man
who
had
been
thus
suddenly
snatched
from
the
only
world
that
ever
had
engaged
his
thoughts
her
outward
aspect
was
calm
and
serene
the
impression
made
upon
feelings
was
of
a
more
powerful
nature
she
had
witnessed
suffering
and
watched
by
but
death
and
death
in
so
terrific
a
form
was
new
to
her
she
had
been
standing
by
her
grandfather
chair
her
head
was
bent
to
his
her
hand
rested
upon
his
when
by
a
momentary
convulsion
she
beheld
the
last
dread
change
the
living
man
transformed
into
the
lifeless
corpse
the
countenance
but
now
fraught
with
life
and
human
thoughts
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
was
covered
with
the
shades
of
death
it
was
in
vain
that
mary
prayed
and
reasoned
and
strove
against
the
feelings
that
had
been
thus
powerfully
excited
one
object
alone
possessed
her
imagination
the
image
of
her
grandfather
dying
dead
his
grim
features
his
ghastly
visage
his
convulsive
grasp
were
ever
present
by
day
and
by
night
her
nervous
system
had
received
a
shock
too
powerful
for
all
the
strength
of
her
understanding
to
contend
with
douglas
sought
by
every
means
to
soothe
her
feelings
and
divert
her
attention
and
flattered
herself
that
a
short
time
would
allay
the
perturbation
of
her
youthful
emotions
five
hundred
persons
horse
and
foot
high
and
low
male
and
female
graced
the
obsequies
of
the
laird
of
glenfern
benenck
was
there
in
his
new
wig
and
the
autumnal
leaves
dropped
on
the
coffin
as
it
was
borne
slowly
along
the
vale
chapter
xxvii
it
is
no
diminution
but
a
recommendation
of
human
nature
that
in
some
instances
passion
gets
the
better
of
reason
and
all
that
we
can
think
is
impotent
against
half
what
we
feel
life
is
a
mingled
yarn
few
of
its
afflictions
but
are
accompanied
with
some
alleviation
none
of
its
blessings
that
do
not
bring
some
alloy
like
most
other
events
that
long
have
formed
the
object
of
yearning
and
almost
hopeless
wishes
and
on
which
have
been
built
the
fairest
structure
of
human
felicity
the
arrival
of
the
young
heir
of
glenfern
produced
a
less
extraordinary
degree
of
happiness
than
had
been
anticipated
the
melancholy
event
which
had
marked
the
first
ceremonial
of
his
life
had
cast
its
gloom
alike
on
all
nearly
connected
with
him
and
when
time
had
dispelled
the
clouds
of
recent
mourning
and
restored
the
mourners
to
their
habitual
train
of
thought
and
action
somewhat
of
the
novelty
which
had
given
him
such
lively
interest
in
the
hearts
of
the
sisters
had
subsided
the
distressing
conviction
too
more
and
more
forced
itself
upon
them
that
their
advice
and
assistance
were
likely
to
be
wholly
overlooked
in
the
nurture
of
the
infant
mind
and
management
of
the
thriving
frame
of
their
little
nephew
their
active
energies
therefore
driven
back
to
the
accustomed
channels
after
many
murmurs
and
severe
struggles
again
revolved
in
the
same
sphere
as
before
true
they
sighed
and
mourned
for
a
time
but
soon
found
occupation
congenial
to
their
nature
in
the
little
departments
of
life
dressing
crape
reviving
black
silk
converting
narrow
hems
into
broad
hems
and
in
short
who
so
busy
who
so
important
as
the
ladies
of
glenfern
as
madame
de
staël
or
de
something
says
they
fulfilled
their
destinies
their
walk
lay
amongst
threads
and
pickles
their
sphere
extended
from
the
garret
to
the
pantry
and
often
as
they
sought
to
diverge
from
it
their
instinct
always
led
them
to
return
to
it
as
the
tract
in
which
they
were
destined
to
move
there
are
creatures
of
the
same
sort
in
the
male
part
of
the
creation
but
it
is
foreign
to
my
purpose
to
describe
them
at
present
neither
are
the
trifling
and
insignificant
of
either
sex
to
be
treated
with
contempt
or
looked
upon
as
useless
by
those
whom
god
has
gifted
with
higher
powers
in
the
arrangements
of
an
providence
there
is
nothing
created
in
vain
every
link
of
the
vast
chain
that
embraces
creation
helps
to
hold
together
the
various
relations
of
life
and
all
is
beautiful
gradation
from
the
human
vegetable
to
the
glorious
archangel
if
patient
hope
if
unexulting
joy
and
chastened
anticipation
sanctifying
a
mother
love
could
have
secured
her
happiness
douglas
would
have
found
in
the
smiles
of
her
infant
all
the
comfort
her
virtue
deserved
but
she
still
had
to
drink
of
that
cup
of
sweet
and
bitter
which
must
bathe
the
lips
of
all
who
breathe
the
breath
of
life
while
the
instinct
of
a
parent
love
warmed
her
heart
as
she
pressed
her
infant
to
her
bosom
the
sadness
of
affectionate
and
rational
solicitude
stifled
every
sentiment
of
pleasure
as
she
gazed
on
the
altered
and
drooping
form
of
her
adopted
daughter
of
the
child
who
had
already
repaid
the
cares
that
had
been
lavished
on
her
and
in
whom
she
descried
the
promise
of
a
plenteous
harvest
from
the
good
seed
she
had
sown
though
mary
had
been
healthy
in
childhood
her
constitution
was
naturally
delicate
and
she
had
latterly
outgrown
her
strength
the
shock
she
had
sustained
by
her
grandfather
death
thus
operating
on
a
weakened
frame
had
produced
an
effect
apparently
most
alarming
and
the
efforts
she
made
to
exert
herself
only
served
to
exhaust
her
she
felt
all
the
watchful
solicitude
the
tender
anxieties
of
her
aunt
and
bitterly
reproached
herself
with
not
better
repaying
these
exertions
for
her
happiness
a
thousand
times
she
tried
to
analyse
and
extirpate
the
saddening
impression
that
weighed
upon
her
heart
it
is
not
sorrow
reasoned
she
with
herself
that
thus
oppresses
me
for
though
i
reverenced
my
grandfather
yet
the
loss
of
his
society
has
scarcely
been
felt
by
me
it
can
not
be
fear
the
fear
of
death
for
my
soul
is
not
so
abject
as
to
confine
its
desires
to
this
sublunary
scene
what
then
is
this
mysterious
dread
that
has
taken
possession
of
me
why
do
i
suffer
my
mind
to
suggest
to
me
images
of
horror
instead
of
visions
of
bliss
why
can
i
not
as
formerly
picture
to
myself
the
beauty
and
the
brightness
of
a
soul
casting
off
mortality
why
must
the
convulsed
grasp
the
stifled
groan
the
glaring
eye
for
ever
come
betwixt
heaven
and
me
alas
mary
was
unskilled
to
answer
hers
was
the
season
for
feeling
not
for
reasoning
she
knew
not
that
hers
was
the
struggle
of
imagination
striving
to
maintain
its
ascendency
over
reality
she
had
heard
and
read
and
thought
and
talked
of
death
but
it
was
of
death
in
its
fairest
form
in
its
softest
transition
and
the
veil
had
been
abruptly
torn
from
her
eyes
the
gloomy
pass
had
suddenly
disclosed
itself
before
her
not
strewed
with
flowers
but
shrouded
in
horrors
like
all
persons
of
sensibility
mary
had
a
disposition
to
view
everything
in
a
ideal
whether
that
is
a
boon
most
fraught
with
good
or
ill
it
were
difficult
to
ascertain
while
the
delusion
lasts
it
is
productive
of
pleasure
to
its
possessor
but
oh
the
thousand
aches
that
heart
is
destined
to
endure
which
clings
to
the
stability
and
relies
on
the
permanency
of
earthly
happiness
but
the
youthful
heart
must
ever
remain
a
stranger
to
this
saddening
truth
experience
only
can
convince
us
that
happiness
is
not
a
plant
of
this
world
and
that
though
many
an
eye
hath
beheld
its
blossoms
no
mortal
hand
hath
ever
gathered
its
fruits
this
then
was
mary
first
lesson
in
what
is
called
the
knowledge
of
life
as
opposed
to
the
of
a
young
and
ardent
imagination
in
love
with
life
and
luxuriating
in
its
own
happiness
and
upon
such
a
mind
it
could
not
fail
of
producing
a
powerful
impression
the
anguish
douglas
experienced
as
she
witnessed
the
changing
colour
lifeless
step
and
forced
smile
of
her
darling
not
mitigated
by
the
good
sense
or
sympathy
of
those
around
her
while
mary
had
prospered
under
her
management
in
the
consciousness
that
she
was
fulfilling
her
duty
to
the
best
of
her
abilities
she
could
listen
with
placid
cheerfulness
to
the
broken
hints
of
disapprobation
or
forced
good
wishes
for
the
success
of
her
schemes
that
were
levelled
at
her
by
the
sisters
but
now
when
her
cares
seemed
defeated
it
was
an
additional
thorn
in
her
heart
to
have
to
endure
the
commonplace
wisdom
and
of
the
almost
exulting
aunts
not
that
they
had
the
slightest
intention
of
wounding
the
feelings
of
their
niece
whom
they
really
loved
but
the
temptation
was
irresistible
of
proving
that
they
had
been
in
the
right
and
she
in
the
wrong
especially
as
no
such
acknowledgment
had
yet
been
extorted
from
her
it
is
nonsense
to
ascribe
mary
dwining
to
her
grandfather
death
said
miss
jacky
we
were
all
nearer
to
him
in
propinquity
than
she
was
and
none
of
our
healths
have
suffered
and
there
his
own
daughters
added
miss
grizzy
who
of
course
must
have
felt
a
great
deal
more
than
anybody
else
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
that
such
sensible
creatures
as
them
must
feel
a
great
deal
but
yet
you
see
how
they
have
got
up
their
spirits
i
sure
wonderful
it
shows
their
sense
and
the
effects
of
education
said
miss
jacky
girls
that
sup
their
porridge
will
always
cut
a
good
figure
quoth
nicky
with
their
fine
feelings
i
sure
we
have
all
reason
to
be
thankful
that
they
have
been
blest
with
such
hearty
stomachs
observed
miss
grizzy
if
they
had
been
delicate
like
poor
mary
i
sure
i
declare
i
do
know
what
we
would
have
done
for
certainly
they
were
all
most
dreadfully
affected
at
their
excellent
father
death
which
was
quite
natural
poor
things
i
sure
there
no
pacifying
poor
baby
and
even
yet
neither
bella
nor
betsey
can
bear
to
be
left
alone
in
a
dark
room
tibby
has
to
sleep
with
them
still
every
night
and
alighted
candle
is
much
to
their
credit
and
yet
i
sure
it
not
with
reading
i
i
think
there
no
doubt
of
it
that
reading
does
young
people
much
harm
it
puts
things
into
their
heads
that
never
would
have
been
there
but
for
books
i
declare
i
think
reading
a
very
dangerous
thing
i
certain
all
mary
bad
health
is
entirely
owing
to
reading
you
know
we
always
thought
she
read
a
great
deal
too
much
for
her
good
much
depends
upon
the
choice
of
books
said
jacky
with
an
air
of
the
most
profound
wisdom
fordyce
sermons
and
the
history
of
scotland
are
two
of
the
very
few
books
would
put
into
the
hands
of
a
young
woman
our
girls
have
read
little
else
casting
a
look
at
douglas
who
was
calmly
pursuing
her
work
in
the
midst
of
this
shower
of
darts
all
levelled
at
her
to
be
sure
returned
grizzy
it
is
a
thousand
pities
that
mary
has
been
allowed
to
go
on
so
long
not
i
sure
that
any
of
us
mean
to
reflect
upon
you
my
dear
douglas
for
of
course
it
was
all
owing
to
your
ignorance
and
inexperience
and
that
you
know
you
could
not
help
for
it
as
not
your
fault
nobody
can
blame
you
i
certain
you
would
have
done
what
is
right
if
you
had
only
known
better
but
of
course
we
must
all
know
much
better
than
you
because
you
know
we
are
all
a
great
deal
older
and
especially
lady
maclaughlan
who
has
the
greatest
experience
in
the
diseases
of
old
men
especially
and
infants
indeed
it
has
been
he
study
of
her
life
almost
for
you
know
poor
sir
sampson
is
never
well
and
i
dare
say
if
mary
had
taken
some
of
her
nice
which
certainly
cured
duncan
daughter
little
girl
of
the
jaundice
and
used
that
valuable
growing
embrocation
which
we
are
all
sensible
made
baby
great
deal
fatter
i
dare
say
there
would
have
been
thing
the
matter
with
her
mary
has
been
too
much
accustomed
to
spend
both
her
time
and
money
amongst
idle
vagrants
said
nicky
economy
of
both
subjoined
jacky
with
an
air
of
humility
confess
i
have
ever
been
accustomed
to
consider
as
virtues
these
handsome
respectable
new
bonnets
looking
douglas
that
our
girls
got
just
before
their
poor
father
death
were
entirely
the
fruits
of
their
own
savings
and
i
declare
said
grizzy
who
did
not
excel
in
innuendos
i
declare
for
my
part
although
at
the
same
time
my
dear
niece
i
certain
you
are
far
from
intending
it
i
really
think
it
very
disrespectful
to
sir
sampson
and
lady
maclaughlan
in
anybody
and
especially
such
near
neighbours
to
give
more
in
charity
than
they
do
for
you
may
be
sure
they
give
as
much
as
they
think
proper
and
they
must
be
the
best
judges
and
can
afford
to
give
what
they
please
for
sir
sampson
could
buy
and
sell
all
of
us
a
hundred
times
over
if
he
liked
it
long
since
the
lochmarlie
estate
was
called
seven
thousand
a
year
and
besides
that
there
the
birkendale
property
and
the
glenmavis
estate
and
i
sure
i
ca
tell
you
all
what
but
there
no
doubt
he
a
man
of
immense
fortune
well
it
was
known
and
frequently
was
it
discussed
the
iniquity
of
mary
being
allowed
to
waste
her
time
and
squander
her
money
amongst
the
poor
instead
of
being
taught
the
practical
virtues
of
making
her
own
gowns
and
of
hoarding
up
her
for
some
selfish
gratification
in
colloquies
such
as
these
day
after
day
passed
on
without
any
visible
improvement
taking
place
in
her
health
only
one
remedy
suggested
itself
to
douglas
and
that
was
to
remove
her
to
the
south
of
england
for
the
winter
milder
air
and
change
of
scene
she
had
no
doubt
would
prove
efficacious
and
her
opinion
was
confirmed
by
that
of
the
celebrated
who
having
been
summoned
to
the
laird
of
pettlechass
had
paid
a
visit
at
glenfern
how
so
desirable
an
event
was
to
be
accomplished
was
the
difficulty
by
the
death
of
his
father
a
variety
of
business
and
an
extent
of
farming
had
devolved
upon
douglas
which
obliged
him
to
fix
his
residence
at
glenfern
and
rendered
it
impossible
for
him
to
be
long
absent
from
it
douglas
had
engaged
in
the
duties
of
a
nurse
to
her
little
boy
and
to
take
him
or
leave
him
was
equally
out
of
the
question
in
this
dilemma
the
only
resource
that
offered
was
that
of
sending
mary
for
a
few
months
to
her
mother
true
it
was
a
painful
necessity
for
douglas
seldom
heard
from
her
and
when
she
did
her
letters
were
short
and
cold
she
sometimes
desired
a
kiss
to
her
douglas
little
girl
and
once
in
an
extraordinary
fit
of
good
humour
had
actually
sent
a
locket
with
her
hair
in
a
letter
by
post
for
which
douglas
had
to
pay
something
more
than
the
value
of
the
present
this
was
all
that
mary
knew
of
her
mother
and
the
rest
of
her
family
were
still
greater
strangers
to
her
her
father
remained
in
a
distant
station
in
india
and
was
seldom
heard
of
her
brother
was
gone
to
sea
and
though
she
had
written
repeatedly
to
her
sister
her
letters
remained
unnoticed
under
these
circumstances
there
was
something
revolting
in
the
idea
of
obtruding
mary
upon
the
notice
of
her
relations
and
trusting
to
their
kindness
even
for
a
few
months
yet
her
health
perhaps
her
life
was
at
stake
and
douglas
felt
she
had
scarcely
a
right
to
hesitate
mary
has
perhaps
been
too
long
an
alien
from
her
own
family
said
she
to
herself
this
will
be
a
means
of
her
becoming
acquainted
with
them
and
of
introducing
her
to
that
sphere
in
which
she
is
probably
destined
to
walk
under
her
uncle
roof
she
will
surely
be
safe
and
in
the
society
of
her
mother
and
sister
she
can
not
be
unhappy
new
scenes
will
give
a
stimulus
to
her
mind
the
necessity
of
exertion
will
brace
the
languid
faculties
of
her
soul
and
a
few
short
months
i
trust
will
restore
her
to
me
such
and
even
superior
to
what
she
was
why
then
should
i
hesitate
to
do
what
my
conscience
tells
me
ought
to
be
done
alas
it
is
because
i
selfishly
shrink
from
the
pain
of
separation
and
am
unwilling
to
relinquish
even
for
a
season
one
of
the
many
blessings
heaven
has
bestowed
upon
me
and
douglas
noble
and
disinterested
as
ever
rose
superior
to
the
weakness
that
she
felt
was
besetting
her
mary
listened
to
her
communication
with
a
throbbing
heart
and
eyes
suffused
with
tears
to
part
from
her
aunt
was
agony
but
to
behold
her
mother
she
to
whom
she
owed
her
existence
to
embrace
a
sister
too
and
one
for
whom
she
felt
all
those
mysterious
yearnings
which
twins
are
said
to
entertain
towards
each
other
oh
there
was
rapture
in
the
thought
and
mary
buoyant
heart
fluctuated
between
the
extremes
of
anguish
and
delight
the
venerable
sisters
received
the
intelligence
with
much
surprise
they
did
not
know
very
well
what
to
say
about
it
there
was
much
to
be
said
both
for
and
against
it
lady
maclaughlan
had
a
high
opinion
of
english
air
but
then
they
had
heard
the
morals
of
the
people
were
not
so
good
and
there
were
a
great
many
dissipated
young
men
in
england
though
to
be
sure
there
was
no
denying
but
the
mineral
waters
were
excellent
and
in
short
it
ended
in
miss
grizzy
sitting
down
to
concoct
an
epistle
to
lady
maclaughlan
in
miss
jacky
beginning
to
draw
up
a
code
of
instructions
for
a
young
woman
upon
her
entrance
into
life
and
miss
nicky
hoping
that
if
mary
did
go
she
would
take
care
not
to
bring
back
any
extravagant
english
notions
with
her
the
younger
set
debated
amongst
themselves
how
many
of
them
would
be
invited
to
accompany
mary
to
england
and
from
thence
fell
to
disputing
the
possession
of
a
brown
hair
trunk
with
a
flourished
d
in
brass
letters
on
the
top
douglas
with
repressed
feelings
set
about
offering
the
sacrifice
she
had
planned
and
in
a
letter
to
lady
juliana
descriptive
of
her
daughter
situation
she
sought
to
excite
her
tenderness
without
creating
an
alarm
how
far
she
succeeded
will
be
seen
hereafter
in
the
meantime
we
must
take
a
retrospective
glance
at
the
last
seventeen
years
of
her
ladyship
life
chapter
xxviii
only
labour
was
to
kill
the
time
and
labour
dire
it
is
and
weary
woe
of
years
had
rolled
on
amidst
heartless
pleasures
and
joyless
amusements
but
lady
juliana
was
made
neither
the
wiser
nor
the
better
by
added
years
and
increased
experience
time
had
in
vain
turned
his
glass
before
eyes
still
dazzled
with
the
gaudy
allurements
of
the
world
for
she
took
no
note
of
time
but
as
the
thing
that
was
to
take
her
to
the
opera
and
the
park
and
that
sometimes
hurried
her
excessively
and
sometimes
bored
her
to
death
at
length
she
was
compelled
to
abandon
her
chase
after
happiness
in
the
only
sphere
where
she
believed
it
was
to
be
found
lord
courtland
declining
health
unfitted
him
for
the
dissipation
of
a
london
life
and
by
the
advice
of
his
physician
he
resolved
upon
retiring
to
a
country
seat
which
he
possessed
in
the
vicinity
of
bath
lady
juliana
was
in
despair
at
the
thoughts
of
this
sudden
wrench
from
what
she
termed
life
but
she
had
no
resource
for
though
her
husband
gave
her
the
whole
of
general
allowance
that
scarcely
served
to
keep
her
in
clothes
and
though
her
brother
was
perfectly
willing
that
she
and
her
children
should
occupy
apartments
in
his
house
yet
he
would
have
been
equally
acquiescent
had
she
proposed
to
remove
from
it
lady
juliana
had
a
sort
of
instinctive
knowledge
of
this
which
prevented
her
from
breaking
out
into
open
remonstrance
she
therefore
contented
herself
with
being
more
than
usually
peevish
and
irascible
to
her
servants
and
children
and
talking
to
her
friends
of
the
prodigious
sacrifice
she
was
about
to
make
for
her
brother
and
his
family
as
if
it
had
been
the
cutting
off
of
a
hand
or
the
plucking
out
of
an
eye
to
have
heard
her
anyone
unaccustomed
to
the
hyperbole
of
fashionable
language
would
have
deemed
botany
bay
the
nearest
possible
point
of
destination
parting
from
her
fashionable
acquaintances
was
tearing
herself
from
all
she
loved
quitting
london
was
bidding
adieu
to
the
world
of
course
there
could
be
no
society
where
she
was
going
but
still
she
would
do
her
duty
she
would
not
desert
dear
frederick
and
his
poor
children
in
short
no
martyr
was
ever
led
to
the
stake
with
half
the
notions
of
heroism
and
as
those
with
which
lady
juliana
stepped
into
the
barouche
that
was
to
conduct
her
to
beech
park
in
the
society
of
piping
bullfinches
pink
canaries
gray
parrots
goldfish
green
squirrels
italian
greyhounds
and
french
poodles
she
sought
a
refuge
from
despair
but
even
these
varied
charms
after
a
while
failed
to
please
the
bullfinches
grew
hoarse
the
canaries
turned
brown
the
parrots
became
stupid
the
gold
fish
would
not
eat
the
squirrels
were
cross
the
dogs
fought
even
a
shell
grotto
that
was
constructing
fell
down
and
by
the
time
the
aviary
and
conservatory
were
filled
they
had
lost
their
interest
the
children
were
the
next
subjects
for
her
ladyship
ennui
to
discharge
itself
upon
lord
courtland
had
a
son
some
years
older
and
a
daughter
nearly
of
the
same
age
as
her
own
it
suddenly
occurred
to
her
that
they
must
be
educated
and
that
she
would
educate
the
girls
herself
as
the
first
step
she
engaged
two
governesses
french
and
italian
modern
treatises
on
the
subject
of
education
were
ordered
from
london
looked
at
admired
and
arranged
on
gilded
shelves
and
sofa
tables
and
could
their
contents
have
exhaled
with
the
odours
of
their
russia
leather
bindings
lady
juliana
would
have
been
what
sir
joshua
reynolds
says
every
seminary
of
learning
an
atmosphere
of
floating
knowledge
but
amidst
this
splendid
display
of
human
lore
the
book
found
no
place
she
heard
of
the
bible
however
and
even
knew
it
was
a
book
appointed
to
be
read
in
churches
and
given
to
poor
people
along
with
rumford
soup
and
flannel
shirts
but
as
the
rule
of
life
as
the
book
that
alone
could
make
wise
unto
salvation
this
christian
parent
was
ignorant
as
the
hottentot
or
hindoo
three
days
beheld
the
rise
progress
and
decline
of
lady
whole
system
of
education
and
it
would
have
been
well
for
the
children
had
the
trust
been
delegated
to
those
better
qualified
to
discharge
it
but
neither
of
the
preceptresses
was
better
skilled
in
the
only
true
knowledge
signora
cicianai
was
a
bigoted
catholic
whose
faith
hung
upon
her
beads
and
madame
grignon
was
an
forte
who
had
no
faith
in
anything
but
but
the
signora
singing
was
heavenly

so
passed
the
first
years
of
beings
training
for
immortality
the
children
insensibly
ceased
to
be
children
and
lady
juliana
would
have
beheld
the
increasing
height
and
beauty
of
her
daughter
with
extreme
disapprobation
had
not
that
beauty
by
awakening
her
ambition
also
excited
her
affection
if
the
term
affection
could
be
applied
to
that
heterogeneous
mass
of
feelings
and
propensities
that
shape
had
none
distinguishable
lady
juliana
had
fallen
into
an
error
very
common
with
wiser
heads
than
hers
that
of
mistaking
the
for
the
she
looked
no
farther
than
to
her
union
with
henry
douglas
for
the
foundation
of
all
her
unhappiness
it
never
once
occurred
to
her
that
her
marriage
was
only
the
of
something
previously
wrong
she
saw
not
the
headstrong
passions
that
had
impelled
her
to
please
herself
no
matter
at
what
price
she
thought
not
of
the
want
of
principle
she
blushed
not
at
the
want
of
delicacy
that
had
led
her
to
deceive
a
parent
and
elope
with
a
man
to
whose
character
she
was
a
total
stranger
she
therefore
considered
herself
as
having
fallen
a
victim
to
love
and
could
she
only
save
her
daughter
from
a
similar
error
she
might
yet
by
her
means
retrieve
her
fallen
fortune
to
implant
principles
of
religion
and
virtue
in
her
mind
was
not
within
the
compass
of
her
own
but
she
could
scoff
at
every
pure
and
generous
affection
she
could
ridicule
every
disinterested
attachment
and
she
could
expatiate
on
the
joys
that
attend
on
wealth
and
titles
jewels
and
equipages
and
all
this
she
did
in
the
belief
that
she
was
acting
the
part
of
a
most
wise
and
tender
parent
the
seed
thus
carefully
sown
promised
to
bring
forth
an
abundant
harvest

adelaide
douglas
was
as
heartless
and
ambitious
as
she
was
beautiful
and
accomplished
but
the
surface
was
covered
with
flowers
and
who
would
have
thought
of
analysing
the
soil
it
sometimes
happens
that
the
very
means
used
with
success
in
the
formation
of
one
character
produce
a
totally
opposite
effect
upon
another
the
mind
of
lady
emily
lindore
had
undergone
exactly
the
same
process
in
its
formation
as
that
of
her
cousin
yet
in
all
things
they
differed
whether
it
were
the
independence
of
high
birth
or
the
pride
of
a
mind
conscious
of
its
own
powers
she
had
hitherto
resisted
the
sophistry
of
her
governesses
and
the
solecisms
of
her
aunt
but
her
notions
of
right
and
wrong
were
too
crude
to
influence
the
general
tenor
of
her
life
or
operate
as
restraints
upon
a
naturally
high
spirit
and
impetuous
temper
not
all
the
united
efforts
of
her
preceptresses
had
been
able
to
form
a
manner
for
their
pupil
nor
could
their
authority
restrain
her
from
saying
what
she
thought
and
doing
what
she
pleased
and
in
spite
of
both
precept
and
example
lady
emily
remained
as
insupportably
natural
and
sincere
as
she
was
beautiful
and
at
six
years
old
she
had
declared
her
intention
of
marrying
her
cousin
edward
douglas
and
at
eighteen
her
words
were
little
less
equivocal
lord
courtland
who
never
disturbed
himself
about
anything
was
rather
diverted
with
this
juvenile
attachment
and
lady
juliana
who
cared
little
for
her
son
and
still
less
for
her
niece
only
wondered
how
people
could
be
such
fools
as
to
think
of
marrying
for
love
after
she
had
told
them
how
miserable
it
would
make

labours
were
vain
for
her

a
dead
letter

this
day
douglas
was
therefore
the
first
to
convey
the
unwelcome
intelligence
and
to
suggest
to
the
mind
of
the
mother
that
her
alienated
daughter
still
retained
some
claims
upon
her
care
and
affection
and
although
this
was
done
with
all
the
tenderness
and
delicacy
of
a
gentle
and
enlightened
mind
it
called
forth
the
most
bitter
indignation
from
lady
juliana
she
almost
raved
at
what
she
termed
the
base
ingratitude
and
hypocrisy
of
her
after
the
sacrifice
she
had
made
in
giving
up
her
child
to
her
when
she
had
none
of
her
own
it
was
a
pretty
return
to
send
her
back
only
to
die
but
she
saw
through
it
she
did
not
believe
a
word
of
the
girl
silliness
that
was
a
trick
to
get
rid
of
her
now
they
had
a
child
of
their
own
they
had
no
use
for
hers
but
she
was
not
to
be
made
a
fool
of
in
such
a
way
and
by
such
people
etc
etc
if
douglas
is
so
vile
a
woman
said
the
provoking
lady
emily
the
sooner
my
cousin
is
taken
from
her
the
better
you
do
understand
these
things
emily
returned
her
aunt
impatiently
what
things
the
trouble
and
annoyance
it
will
occasion
me
to
take
charge
of
the
girl
at
this
time
why
at
this
time
more
than
at
any
other
absurd
my
dear
how
can
you
ask
so
foolish
a
question
do
you
know
that
you
and
adelaide
are
both
to
bring
out
this
winter
and
how
can
i
possibly
do
you
justice
with
a
dying
girl
upon
my
hands
i
thought
you
suspected
it
was
all
a
trick
continued
the
persecuting
lady
emily
so
i
do
i
have
the
least
doubt
of
it
the
whole
story
is
the
most
improbable
stuff
i
ever
heard
then
you
will
have
less
trouble
than
you
expect
but
i
hate
to
be
made
a
dupe
of
and
imposed
upon
by
low
cunning
if
douglas
had
told
me
candidly
she
wished
me
to
take
the
girl
i
would
have
thought
nothing
of
it
but
i
ca
bear
to
be
treated
like
a
fool
i
do
see
anything
at
all
unbecoming
in
douglas
treatment
then
what
can
i
do
with
a
girl
who
has
been
educated
in
scotland
she
must
be
vulgar
all
scotchwomen
are
so
they
have
red
hands
and
rough
voices
they
yawn
and
blow
their
noses
and
talk
and
laugh
loud
and
do
a
thousand
shocking
things
then
to
hear
the
scotch
brogue
oh
heavens
i
should
expire
every
time
she
opened
her
mouth
perhaps
my
sister
may
not
speak
so
broad
kindly
suggested
adelaide
in
her
sweetest
accents
you
are
very
good
my
love
to
think
so
but
nobody
can
live
in
that
odious
country
without
being
infected
with
its
i
really
thought
i
should
have
caught
it
myself

no

henry
became
quite
gross

this

cried
lady

indignantly
if
a

speaks

what
does
it

it

whether

chooses

not

at

invite
my

to
my

and
snatching
up

she
instantly

lady
juliana
was
highly
incensed
at
this
freedom
of
her
niece
but
she
was
a
little
afraid
of
her
and
therefore
after
some
sharp
altercation
and
with
infinite
violence
done
to
her
feelings
she
was
prevailed
upon
to
write
a
decently
civil
sort
of
a
letter
to
douglas
consenting
to
receive
her
daughter
for
a
months
firmly
resolving
in
her
own
mind
to
conceal
her
from
all
eyes
and
ears
while
she
remained
and
to
return
her
to
her
scotch
relations
early
in
the
summer
this
worthy
resolution
formed
she
became
more
serene
and
awaited
the
arrival
of
her
daughter
with
as
much
firmness
as
could
reasonably
have
been
expected

the

ladies
of

the
ungracious
reception
their
was
likely
to
experience
from
her
mother
for
in
spite
of
the
defects
of
her
education
mary
was
a
general
favourite
in
the
family
and
however
they
might
solace
themselves
by
depreciating
her
to
douglas
to
the
world
in
general
and
their
young
female
acquaintances
in
particular
she
was
upheld
as
an
epitome
of
every
perfection
above
and
below
the
sun
had
it
been
possible
for
them
to
conceive
that
mary
could
have
been
received
with
anything
short
of
rapture
lady

letter
might
in
some
measure
have
opened
the
eyes
of
their
understanding
but
to
the
guileless
sisters
it
seemed
everything
that
was
proper
sorry
for
the
necessity
douglas
felt
under
of
parting
with
her
adopted
daughter
was
prettily
expressed
had
no
doubt
it
was
merely
a
slight
nervous
affection
was
kind
and
soothing
and
the
assurance
more
than
once
repeated
that
her
friends
might
rely
upon
her
being
returned
to
them
in
the
course
of
a
very
few
months
showed
a
great
deal
of
feeling
and
consideration
but
as
their
minds
never
maintained
a
just
equilibrium
long
upon
any
subject
but
like
falsely
adjusted
scales
were
ever
hovering
and
vibrating
at
either
extreme
so
they
could
not
rest
satisfied
in
the
belief
that
mary
was
to
be
happy
there
must
be
something
to
counteract
that
stilling
sentiment
and
that
was
the
apprehension
that
mary
would
be
spoilt
this
for
the
present
was
the
pendulum
of
their
imaginations
i
declare
mary
my
sisters
and
i
could
get
no
sleep
last
night
for
thinking
of
you
said
miss
grizzy
are
all
certain
that
lady
juliana
especially
but
indeed
all
your
english
relations
will
think
so
much
of
you
from
not
knowing
you
you
know
which
will
be
quite
natural
i
sure
that
my
sisters
and
i
have
taken
it
into
our
heads
but
i
hope
it
wo
be
the
case
as
you
have
a
great
deal
of
good
sense
of
your
own
that
they
will
quite
turn
your
head
mary
head
is
on
her
shoulders
to
little
purpose
followed
up
miss
jacky
if
she
ca
stand
being
made
of
when
she
goes
amongst
strangers
and
she
ought
to
know
by
this
time
that
a
mother
partiality
is
no
proof
of
a
child
merit
you
hear
that
mary
rejoined
miss
grizzy
so
i
sure
i
hope
you
wo
mind
a
word
that
your
mother
says
to
you
i
mean
about
yourself
for
of
course
you
know
she
ca
be
such
a
good
judge
of
you
as
us
who
have
known
you
all
your
life
as
to
other
things
i
daresay
she
is
very
well
informed
about
the
country
and
politics
and
these
sort
of
things
i
certain
lady
juliana
knows
a
great
deal
and
i
hope
mary
you
will
take
care
and
not
get
into
the
handless
ways
of
the
english
women
said
miss
nicky
i
would
give
a
pin
for
an
englishwoman
and
i
hope
you
will
never
look
at
an
englishman
mary
said
miss
grizzy
with
equal
earnestness
take
my
word
for
it
they
are
a
very
dissipated
unprincipled
set
they
all
drink
and
game
and
keep
and
many
of
them
i
told
even
keep
so
you
may
think
what
it
would
be
for
all
of
us
if
you
were
to
marry
any
of
them
and
tears
streamed
from
the
good
spinster
eyes
at
the
bare
supposition
of
such
a
calamity
do
be
afraid
my
dear
aunt
said
mary
with
a
kind
caress
i
shall
come
back
to
you
your
own
mary
no
englishman
with
his
round
face
and
trim
meadows
shall
ever
captivate
me
heath
covered
hills
and
high
are
the
charms
that
must
win
my
heart
i
delighted
to
hear
you
say
so
my
dear
mary
said
the
grizzy
certainly
nothing
can
be
prettier
than
the
heather
when
it
in
flower
and
there
is
something
very
manly
nobody
can
dispute
that
in
high
and
besides
to
tell
you
a
secret
lady
maclaughlan
has
a
husband
in
her
eye
for
you
we
none
of
us
can
conceive
who
it
is
but
of
course
he
must
be
suitable
in
every
respect
for
you
know
lady
maclaughlan
has
had
three
husbands
herself
so
of
course
she
must
be
an
excellent
judge
of
a
good
husband
or
a
bad
one
said
mary
which
is
the
same
thing
warning
is
as
good
as
example
douglas
ideas
and
those
of
her
aunt
did
not
coincide
upon
this
occasion
more
than
upon
most
others
in
her
letter
she
flattered
herself
she
saw
only
fashionable
indifference
and
she
fondly
hoped
that
would
soon
give
way
to
a
tenderer
sentiment
as
her
daughter
became
known
to
her
at
any
rate
it
was
proper
that
mary
should
make
the
trial
and
whichever
way
it
ended
it
must
be
for
her
advantage
mary
has
already
lived
too
long
in
these
mountain
solitudes
thought
she
her
ideas
will
become
romantic
and
her
taste
fastidious
if
it
is
dangerous
to
be
too
early
initiated
into
the
ways
of
the
world
it
is
perhaps
equally
so
to
live
too
long
secluded
from
it
should
she
make
herself
a
place
in
the
heart
of
her
mother
and
sister
it
will
be
so
much
happiness
gained
and
should
it
prove
otherwise
it
will
be
a
lesson
learnt
a
hard
one
indeed
but
hard
are
the
lessons
we
must
all
learn
in
the
school
of
life
yet
douglas
fortitude
almost
failed
her
as
the
period
of
separation
approached
it
had
been
arranged
by
lady
emily
that
a
carriage
and
servants
should
meet
mary
at
edinburgh
whither
douglas
was
to
convey
her
the
cruel
moment
came
and
mother
sister
relations
friends
all
the
bright
visions
which
mary
sanguine
spirit
had
conjured
up
to
soften
the
parting
pang
all
were
absorbed
in
one
agonising
feeling
one
overwhelming
thought
oh
who
that
for
the
first
time
has
parted
from
the
parent
whose
tenderness
and
love
were
entwined
with
our
earliest
recollections
whose
sympathy
had
soothed
our
infant
sufferings
whose
fondness
had
brightened
our
infant
felicity
who
that
has
a
heart
but
must
have
felt
it
sink
beneath
the
anguish
of
a
first
farewell
yet
bitterer
still
must
be
the
feelings
of
the
parent
upon
committing
the
cherished
object
of
their
cares
and
affections
to
the
stormy
ocean
of
life
when
experience
points
to
the
gathering
cloud
and
rising
surge
which
soon
may
assail
their
defenceless
child
what
can
support
the
mother
heart
but
trust
in
him
whose
eye
slumbereth
not
and
whose
power
extendeth
over
all
it
was
this
pious
hope
this
holy
confidence
that
enabled
this
more
than
mother
to
part
from
her
adopted
child
with
a
resignation
which
no
earthly
motive
could
have
imparted
to
her
mind
it
seems
almost
profanation
to
mingle
with
her
elevated
feelings
the
coarse
yet
simple
sorrows
of
the
aunts
old
and
young
as
they
clung
around
the
nearly
lifeless
mary
each
tendering
the
parting
gift
they
had
kept
as
a
solace
for
the
last
poor
miss
grizzy
was
more
than
usually
incoherent
as
she
displayed
a
nice
new
umbrella
that
could
be
turned
into
a
nice
or
anything
and
a
with
a
little
of
everything
in
it
and
with
a
fresh
burst
of
tears
mary
was
directed
where
she
would
find
and
where
she
was
to
look
for
miss
jacky
was
more
composed
as
she
presented
a
flaming
copy
of
fordyce
sermons
to
young
women
with
a
few
suitable
observations
but
miss
nicky
could
scarcely
find
voice
to
tell
that
the
she
now
tendered
had
once
been
lady
girnchgowl
and
that
it
contained
whitechapel
needles
of
every
size
and
number
the
younger
ladies
had
clubbed
for
the
purchase
of
a
large
locket
in
which
was
enshrined
a
lock
from
each
subscriber
tastefully
arranged
by
the
jeweller
in
the
form
of
a
wheat

farewell
to
the
mountains
high
covered
with
snow
farewell
to
the
straths
and
green
valleys
below
farewell
to
the
forests
and
wild
hanging
woods
farewell
to
the
torrents
and
loud
roaring
floods
happily
in
the
moral
world
as
in
the
material
one
the
warring
elements
have
their
prescribed
bounds
and
the
flood
of
grief
decreaseth
when
it
can
swell
no
higher
but
it
is
only
by
retrospection
we
can
bring
ourselves
to
believe
in
this
obvious
truth
the
young
and
untried
heart
hugs
itself
in
the
bitterness
of
its
emotions
and
takes
a
pride
in
believing
that
its
anguish
can
end
but
with
its
existence
and
it
is
not
till
time
hath
almost
steeped
our
senses
in
forgetfulness
that
we
discover
the
mutability
of
all
human
passions
but
mary
left
it
not
to
the
slow
hand
of
time
to
subdue
in
some
measure
the
grief
that
swelled
her
heart
had
she
given
way
to
selfishness
she
would
have
sought
the
free
indulgence
of
her
sorrow
as
the
only
mitigation
of
it
but
she
felt
also
for
her
uncle
he
was
depressed
at
parting
with
his
wife
and
child
and
he
was
taking
a
long
and
dreary
journey
entirely
upon
her
account
could
she
therefore
be
so
selfish
as
to
add
to
his
uneasiness
by
a
display
of
her
sufferings
no
she
would
strive
to
conceal
it
from
his
observation
though
to
overcome
it
was
impossible
her
feelings
must
ever
remain
the
same
but
she
would
confine
them
to
her
own
breast
and
she
began
to
converse
with
and
even
strove
to
amuse
her
kindhearted
companion
ever
and
anon
indeed
a
rush
of
tender
recollections
came
across
her
mind
and
the
soft
voice
and
the
bland
countenance
of
her
maternal
friend
seemed
for
a
moment
present
to
her
senses
and
then
the
dreariness
and
desolation
that
succeeded
as
the
delusion
vanished
and
all
was
stillness
and
vacuity
even
shot
its
piercing
sting
into
her
ingenuous
heart
levities
on
which
in
her
usual
gaiety
of
spirit
she
had
never
bestowed
a
thought
now
appeared
to
her
as
crimes
of
the
deepest
dye
she
thought
how
often
she
had
slighted
the
counsels
and
neglected
the
wishes
of
her
gentle
monitress
how
she
had
wearied
of
her
good
old
aunts
their
cracked
voices
and
the
everlasting
of
their
knitting
needles
how
coarse
and
vulgar
she
had
sometimes
deemed
the
younger
ones
how
she
had
mimicked
lady
maclaughlan
and
caricatured
sir
sampson
and
even
poor
dear
old
donald
said
she
as
she
summed
up
the
catalogue
of
her
crimes
could
not
escape
my
insolence
and
how
clever
i
thought
it
to
sing
awa
frae
me
donald
and
how
affectedly
i
shuddered
at
everything
he
touched
and
the
sneeshin
mull
was
bedewed
with
tears
of
affectionate
contrition
but
every
painful
sentiment
was
for
a
while
suspended
in
admiration
of
the
magnificent
scenery
that
was
spread
around
them
though
summer
had
fled
and
few
even
of
graces
remained
yet
over
the
august
features
of
mountain
scenery
the
seasons
have
little
control
their
charms
depend
not
upon
richness
of
verdure
or
luxuriance
of
foliage
or
any
of
the
mere
prettinesses
of
nature
but
whether
wrapped
in
snow
or
veiled
in
mist
or
glowing
in
sunshine
their
lonely
grandeur
remains
the
same
and
the
same
feelings
fill
and
elevate
the
soul
in
contemplating
these
mighty
works
of
an
almighty
hand
the
eye
is
never
weary
in
watching
the
thousand
varieties
of
light
and
shade
as
they
flit
over
the
mountain
and
gleam
upon
the
lake
and
the
ear
is
satisfied
with
the
awful
stillness
of
nature
in
her
solitude
others
besides
mary
seemed
to
have
taken
a
fanciful
pleasure
in
combining
the
ideas
of
the
mental
and
elemental
world
for
in
the
dreary
dwelling
where
they
were
destined
to
pass
the
night
she
found
inscribed
the
following
lines
the
busy
winds
war
mid
the
waving
bonghs
and
darkly
rolls
the
heaving
surge
to
land
among
the
flying
clouds
the
moonbeam
glows
with
colours
foreign
to
its
softness
bland
here
one
dark
shadow
melts
in
gloom
profound
the
towering
alps
the
guardians
of
the
lake
there
one
bright
gleam
sheds
silver
light
around
and
shows
the
strife
that
tempests
wake
thus
my
mind
a
busy
memory
plays
that
shakes
the
feelings
to
their
inmost
core
thus
beams
the
light
of
hope
fallacious
ray
when
simple
confidence
can
trust
no
more
so
one
dark
shadow
shrouds
each
bygone
hour
so
one
bright
gleam
the
coming
tempest
shows
of
sorrows
which
though
past
still
lower
and
reveals
th
approach
of
future
woes
while
mary
was
trying
to
decipher
these
somewhat
mystic
lines
her
uncle
was
carrying
on
a
colloquy
in
gaelic
with
their
hostess
the
consequendes
of
the
consultation
were
not
of
the
choicest
description
consisting
of
braxy
mutton
raw
potatoes
wet
bannocks
hard
cheese
and
whisky
very
differently
would
the
travellers
have
fared
had
the
good
nicky
intentions
been
fulfilled
she
had
prepared
with
her
own
hands
a
moorfowl
pie
and
potted
nowt
head
besides
a
profusion
of
what
she
termed
trifles
just
for
mary
poor
thing
to
divert
herself
with
upon
the
road
but
alas
in
the
anguish
of
separation
the
covered
basket
had
been
forgot
and
the
labour
of
miss
nicky
hands
fell
to
be
consumed
by
the
family
though
miss
grizzy
protested
with
tears
in
her
eyes
that
it
went
to
her
heart
like
a
knife
to
eat
poor
mary
puffs
and
snaps
sheep
that
have
died
a
natural
death
and
been
salted
change
of
air
and
variety
of
scene
failed
not
to
produce
the
happiest
effects
upon
mary
languid
frame
and
drooping
spirits
her
cheek
already
glowed
with
health
and
was
sometimes
dimpled
with
smiles
she
still
wept
indeed
as
she
thought
of
those
she
had
left
but
often
while
the
tear
trembled
in
her
eye
its
course
was
arrested
by
wonder
or
admiration
or
delight
for
every
object
had
its
charms
for
her
her
cultivated
taste
and
unsophisticated
mind
could
descry
beauty
in
the
form
of
a
hill
and
grandeur
in
the
foam
of
the
wave
and
elegance
in
the
weeping
birch
as
it
dipped
its
now
almost
leafless
boughs
in
the
mountain
stream
these
simple
pleasures
unknown
alike
to
the
sordid
mind
and
vitiated
taste
are
ever
exquisitely
enjoyed
by
the
refined
yet
unsophisticated
child
of
nature
chapter
xxxii
her
native
sense
improved
by
reading
her
native
sweetness
by
good
breeding
during
their
progress
through
the
highlands
the
travellers
were
hospitably
entertained
at
the
mansions
of
the
country
gentlemen
where
courtesy
and
modern
comfort
combined
to
cheer
the
stranger
guest
but
upon
out
as
it
is
significantly
expressed
by
the
natives
of
these
mountain
regions
viz
entering
the
low
country
they
found
they
had
only
made
a
change
of
difficulties
in
the
highlands
they
were
always
sure
that
wherever
there
was
a
house
that
house
would
be
to
them
a
home
but
on
a
fairday
in
the
little
town
of
g
they
found
themselves
in
the
midst
of
houses
and
surrounded
by
people
yet
unable
to
procure
rest
or
shelter
at
the
only
inn
the
place
afforded
they
were
informed
the
horses
were
baith
oot
an
the
ludgin
a
tane
up
an
mair
tu
while
the
driver
asserted
what
indeed
was
apparent
that
his
beasts
war
nae
fit
to
gang
the
length
o
their
tae
farrer
no
for
the
king
himsel
at
this
moment
a
stout
florid
man
passed
whistling
roy
wife
with
all
his
heart
and
just
as
douglas
was
stepping
out
of
the
carriage
to
try
what
could
be
done
the
same
person
evidently
attracted
by
curiosity
repassed
changing
his
tune
to
there
cauld
kail
in
aberdeen
he
started
at
sight
of
douglas
then
eagerly
grasping
his
hand
ah
archie
douglas
is
this
you
exclaimed
he
with
a
loud
laugh
and
hearty
shake
you
have
forgot
your
old
schoolfellow
bob
gawffaw
a
mutual
recognition
now
took
place
and
much
pleasure
was
manifested
on
both
sides
at
this
unexpected
rencontre
no
time
was
allowed
to
explain
their
embarrassments
for
gawffaw
had
already
tipped
the
the
wink
which
he
seemed
easily
to
comprehend
and
forcing
douglas
to
resume
his
seat
in
the
carriage
he
jumped
in
himself
now
for
howffend
and
gawffaw
ha
ha
ha
this
will
be
a
surprise
upon
her
she
thinks
i
in
my
barn
all
this
time
ha
ha
ha
douglas
here
began
to
express
his
astonishment
at
his
precipitation
and
his
apprehensions
as
to
the
trouble
they
might
occasion
gawffaw
but
bursts
of
laughter
and
broken
expressions
of
delight
were
the
only
replies
he
could
procure
from
his
friend
after
jolting
over
half
a
mile
of
very
bad
road
the
carriage
stopped
at
a
mean
mansion
with
dirty
windows
ruinous
thatched
offices
and
broken
fences
such
was
the
picture
of
still
life
that
of
animated
nature
was
not
less
picturesque
cows
bellowed
and
neighed
and
pigs
grunted
and
geese
gabbled
and
ducks
quacked
and
cocks
and
hens
flapped
and
fluttered
promiscuously
as
they
mingled
in
a
sort
of
yard
divided
from
the
house
by
a
low
dyke
possessing
the
accommodation
of
a
crazy
gate
which
was
bestrode
by
a
parcel
of
boys
what
are
you
about
you
confounded
rascals
called
gawffaw
to
them
naething
answered
one
we
just
takin
a
heize
on
the
yett
answered
another
i
heize
ye
ye
scoundrels
exclaimed
the
incensed
gawffaw
as
he
burst
from
the
carriage
and
snatching
the
driver
whip
from
his
hand
flew
after
the
more
culprits
finding
his
efforts
to
overtake
them
in
vain
here
turned
to
the
door
of
his
mansion
where
stood
his
guests
waiting
to
be
ushered
in
he
opened
the
door
himself
and
led
the
way
to
a
parlour
which
was
quite
of
a
piece
with
the
exterior
of
the
dwelling
a
dim
dusty
table
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
heaped
with
a
variety
of
heterogeneous
articles
of
dress
an
exceeding
dirty
volume
of
a
novel
lay
open
amongst
them
the
floor
was
littered
with
shapings
of
flannel
and
shreds
of
gauzes
ribbons
etc
the
fire
was
almost
out
and
the
hearth
was
covered
with
ashes
after
insisting
upon
his
guests
being
seated
gawffaw
walked
to
the
door
of
the
apartment
and
hallooed
out
gawffaw
ho
may
my
dear
i
say
mrs
gawffaw
a
low
croaking
querulous
voice
was
now
heard
in
reply
for
sake
gawffaw
make
less
noise
for
god
sake
have
mercy
on
the
walls
of
your
house
if
you
none
on
my
poor
head
and
thereupon
entered
gawffaw
a
cap
in
one
hand
which
she
appeared
to
have
been
tying
on
a
in
the
other
she
possessed
a
considerable
share
of
insipid
and
somewhat
faded
beauty
but
disguised
by
a
tawdry
trumpery
style
of
dress
and
rendered
almost
disgusting
by
the
air
of
affectation
folly
and
peevishness
that
overspread
her
whole
person
and
deportment
she
testified
the
utmost
surprise
and
coldness
at
sight
of
her
guests
and
as
she
entered
gawffaw
rushed
out
having
descried
something
passing
in
the
yard
that
called
for
his
interposition
douglas
was
therefore
under
the
necessity
of
introducing
himself
and
mary
to
their
ungracious
hostess
briefly
stating
the
circumstances
that
had
led
them
to
be
her
guests
and
dwelling
with
much
warmth
on
the
kindness
and
hospitality
of
her
husband
in
having
relieved
them
from
their
embarrassment
a
gracious
smile
or
what
was
intended
as
such
beamed
over
gawffaw
face
at
first
mention
of
their
names
excuse
me
douglas
said
she
making
a
profound
reverence
to
him
and
another
to
mary
while
she
waved
her
hand
for
them
to
be
seated
excuse
me
miss
douglas
but
situated
as
i
am
i
find
it
necessary
to
be
very
distant
to
gawffaw
friends
sometimes
he
is
a
thoughtless
man
douglas
a
very
thoughtless
man
he
makes
a
perfect
inn
of
his
house
he
never
lies
out
of
the
town
trying
who
he
can
pick
up
and
bring
home
with
him
it
is
seldom
i
am
so
fortunate
as
to
see
such
guests
as
and
miss
douglas
of
glenfern
castle
in
my
house
with
an
elegant
bow
to
each
which
of
course
was
duly
returned
but
gawffaw
would
have
shown
more
consideration
both
for
you
and
me
had
he
apprised
me
of
the
honour
of
your
visit
instead
of
bringing
you
here
in
this
ill
bred
unceremonious
manner
as
for
me
i
am
too
well
accustomed
to
him
to
be
hurt
at
these
things
now
he
has
kept
me
in
hot
water
i
may
say
since
the
day
i
married
him
in
spite
of
the
conciliatory
manner
in
which
this
agreeable
address
was
made
douglas
felt
considerably
disconcerted
and
again
renewed
his
apologies
adding
something
about
hopes
of
being
able
to
proceed
make
no
apologies
my
dear
sir
said
the
lady
with
what
she
deemed
a
most
bewitching
manner
it
affords
me
the
greatest
pleasure
to
see
any
of
your
family
under
my
roof
i
meant
no
reflection
on
you
it
is
entirely
gawffaw
that
is
to
blame
in
not
having
apprised
me
of
the
honour
of
this
visit
that
i
might
not
have
been
caught
in
this
déshabille
but
i
was
really
so
engaged
by
my
studies
pointing
to
the
dirty
novel
that
i
was
quite
unconscious
of
the
lapse
of
time
the
guests
felt
more
and
more
at
a
loss
what
to
say
but
the
lady
was
at
none
seeing
douglas
still
standing
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
his
eye
directed
towards
the
door
she
resumed
her
discourse
pray
be
seated
douglas
i
beg
you
will
sit
off
the
door
miss
douglas
i
entreat
you
will
walk
into
the
fire
i
hope
you
will
consider
yourself
as
quite
at
home
another
elegant
bend
to
each
i
only
regret
that
gawffaw
folly
and
should
have
brought
you
into
this
disagreeable
situation
douglas
he
is
a
man
douglas
and
a
man
but
he
is
very
deficient
in
other
respects
mr
douglas
douglas
happy
to
find
anything
to
which
he
could
assent
warmly
joined
in
the
eulogium
on
the
excellence
of
his
friend
heart
it
did
not
appear
however
to
give
the
satisfaction
he
expected
the
lady
resumed
with
a
sigh
nobody
can
know
gawffaw
heart
better
than
i
do
douglas
it
a
good
one
but
it
is
far
from
being
an
elegant
one
it
is
one
in
which
i
find
no
congeniality
of
sentiment
with
my
own
indeed
gawffaw
is
no
companion
for
me
nor
i
for
him
douglas
he
is
never
happy
in
my
society
and
i
really
believe
he
would
rather
sit
down
with
the
tinklers
on
the
roadside
as
spend
a
day
in
my
company
a
deep
sigh
followed
but
its
pathos
was
drowned
in
the
obstreperous
ha
ha
ha
of
her
joyous
helpmate
as
he
bounced
into
the
room
wiping
his
forehead
may
my
dear
what
have
you
been
things
have
been
all
going
to
the
deuce
why
did
you
hinder
these
boys
from
sweein
the
gate
off
its
hinges
and
me
hinder
boys
from
sweein
gates
gawffaw
do
i
look
like
as
if
i
was
capable
of
hindering
boys
from
sweein
gates
miss
douglas
well
my
dear
you
ought
to
look
after
your
pigs
a
little
better
that
jade
black
jess
has
trod
a
parcel
of
them
to
death
ha
ha
ha
and
me
look
after
pigs
gawffaw
i
am
really
astonished
at
you
again
interrupted
the
lady
turning
pale
with
vexation
then
with
an
affected
giggle
appealing
to
mary
i
leave
you
to
judge
miss
douglas
if
i
look
like
a
person
made
for
running
after
pigs
indeed
thought
mary
you
do
look
like
as
if
you
could
do
anything
half
so
useful
well
never
mind

hours

i
was
always
accustomed
to
them
in
my
poor
father
lifetime
he
never
dined
before
four
and
i
seldom
knew
what
it
was
to
be
in
my
bed
before
twelve
at
night
miss
douglas
till
i
married
mr
gawffaw
mary
tried
to
look
sorrowful
to
hide
the
smile
that
was
dimpling
her
cheek
come

have
something
to
eat

meantime

i

house

gawffaw
what
would
you
take
miss
douglas
but
pull
the
bell
softly
gawffaw
you
do
everything
so
violently
a
dirty
with
bare
feet
answered
the
summons
where
tom
demanded
the
lady
well
knowing
that
tom
was
afar
off
at
some
of
the
farm
operations
i
ken
nae
whar
he
he
be
aether
at
the
patatees
or
the
horses
warran
div
ye
want
him
bring
some
glasses
said
her
mistress
with
an
air
of
great
dignity
gawffaw
you
must
see
about
the
wine
yourself
since
you
have
sent
tom
out
of
the
way
gawffaw
and
his
handmaid
were
soon
heard
in
an
adjoining
closet
the
one
wondering
where
the
screw
was
the
other
vociferating
for
a
knife
to
cut
the
bread
while
the
mistress
of
this
mansion
sought
to
divert
her
guests
attention
from
what
was
passing
by
entertaining
them
with
complaints
of
gawffaw
noise
and
her
insolence
till
the
parties
appeared
to
speak
for
themselves
after
being
refreshed
with
some
very
bad
wine
and
old
baked
bread
the
gentlemen
set
off
on
a
survey
of
the
farm
and
the
ladies
repaired
to
their
toilets
mary
simple
dress
was
quickly
adjusted
and
upon
descending
she
found
her
uncle
alone
in
what
gawffaw
had
shown
to
her
as
the
drawing
room
he
guessed
her
curiosity
to
know
something
of
her
hosts
and
therefore
briefly
informed
her
that
gawffaw
was
the
daughter
of
a
trader
in
some
manufacturing
town
who
had
lived
in
opulence
and
died
insolvent
during
his
life
his
daughter
had
eloped
with
bob
gawffaw
then
a
gay
lieutenant
in
a
marching
regiment
who
had
been
esteemed
a
very
lucky
fellow
in
getting
the
pretty
miss
croaker
with
the
prospect
of
ten
thousand
pounds
none
thought
more
highly
of
her
husband
good
fortune
than
the
lady
herself
and
though
fortune
never
was
realised
she
gave
herself
all
the
airs
of
having
been
the
making
of
his
at
this
time
gawffaw
was
a
reduced
lieutenant
living
upon
a
small
paternal
property
which
he
pretended
to
farm
but
the
habits
of
a
military
life
joined
to
a
naturally
social
disposition
were
rather
inimical
to
the
pursuits
of
agriculture
and
most
of
his
time
was
spent
in
loitering
about
the
village
of
g
where
he
generally
continued
either
to
pick
up
a
guest
or
procure
a
dinner
gawffaw
despised
her
husband
had
weak
nerves
and
headaches
was
above
managing
her
house
read
novels
dyed
ribbons
and
altered
her
gowns
according
to
every
pattern
she
could
see
or
hear
of
such
were
and
gawffaw
one
of
the
many
couples
in
this
world
joined
not
matched
a
sensible
man
would
have
curbed
her
folly
and
peevishness
a
woman
would
have
made
his
home
comfortable
and
rendered
him
more
domestic
the
dinner
was
such
as
might
have
been
expected
from
the
previous
specimens
bad
of
its
kind
cold
and
slovenly
set
down
but
gawtfaw
seemed
satisfied
with
herself
and
it
this
is
very
fine
mutton
douglas
and
not
underdone
to
most
people
tastes
and
this
fowl
i
have
no
doubt
will
eat
well
miss
douglas
though
it
is
not
so
white
as
some
i
have
seen
the
fowl
my
dear
looks
as
if
it
had
been
the
of
this
sheep
ha
ha
ha
for
heaven
sake
gawffaw
make
less
noise
or
my
head
will
split
in
a
thousand
pieces
putting
her
hands
to
it
as
if
to
hold
the
frail
tenement
together
this
was
always
her
refuge
when
at
a
loss
for
a
reply
a
very
pudding
next
called
forth
her
approbation
this
pudding
should
be
good
for
it
is
the
same
i
used
to
be
so
partial
to
in
my
poor
father
lifetime
when
i
was
used
to
every
delicacy
miss
douglas
that
money
could
purchase
but
you
thought
me
the
greatest
delicacy
of
all
my
dear
ha
ha
ha
for
you
left
all
your
other
delicacies
for
me
ha
ha
ha
i
what
do
you
say
to
that
may
ha
ha
ha
may
reply
consisted
in
putting
her
hands
to
her
head
with
an
air
of
inexpressible
vexation
and
finding
all
her
endeavours
to
be
elegant
frustrated
by
the
overpowering
vulgarity
of
her
husband
she
remained
silent
during
the
remainder
of
the
repast
solacing
herself
with
complacent
glances
at
her
yellow
silk
gown
and
adjusting
the
gold
chains
and
necklaces
that
adorned
her
bosom
poor
mary
was
doomed
to
a
with
her
during
the
whole
evening
for
gawffaw
was
too
happy
his
friend
and
his
wife
to
quit
the
till
a
late
hour
and
then
he
was
so
much
exhilarated
that
she
could
almost
have
joined
gawffaw
in
her
exclamation
of
for
heaven
sake
gawffaw
have
mercy
on
my
head
the
night
however
like
all
other
nights
had
a
close
and
gawffaw
having
once
more
enjoyed
the
felicity
of
finding
herself
in
company
at
twelve
at
night
at
length
withdraw
and
having
apologised
and
hoped
and
feared
for
another
hour
in
mary
apartment
she
finally
left
her
to
the
blessings
of
solitude
and
repose
as
douglas
was
desirous
of
reaching
edinburgh
the
following
day
he
had
in
spite
of
the
urgent
remonstrances
of
his
friendly
host
and
the
elegant
importunities
of
his
lady
ordered
the
carriage
at
an
early
hour
and
mary
was
too
eager
to
quit
howffend
to
keep
it
waiting
gawffaw
was
in
readiness
to
hand
her
in
but
fortunately
head
did
not
permit
of
her
rising
with
much
the
same
hearty
laugh
that
had
welcomed
their
meeting
honest
gawffaw
now
saluted
the
departure
of
his
friend
and
as
he
went
whistling
over
his
gate
he
ruminated
sweet
and
bitter
thoughts
as
to
the
destinies
of
the
day
whether
he
should
solace
himself
with
a
good
dinner
and
the
company
of
bailie
merry
thought
at
the
cross
keys
in
g
or
put
up
with
cold
mutton
and
may
at

chapter
xxxiii
edina
scotia
darling
seat
all
hail
thy
palaces
and
where
once
beneath
a
monarch
feet
sat
legislation
burns
all
mary
sensations
of
admiration
were
faint
compared
to
those
she
experienced
as
she
viewed
the
scottish
metropolis
it
was
associated
in
her
mind
with
all
the
local
prepossessions
to
which
youth
and
enthusiasm
love
to
give
a
local
habitation
and
a
name
and
visions
of
older
times
floated
her
mind
as
she
gazed
on
its
rocky
battlements
and
traversed
the
lonely
arcades
of
its
deserted
palace
and
this
was
once
a
gay
court
thought
she
as
she
listened
to
the
dreary
echo
of
her
own
footsteps
and
this
very
ground
on
which
i
now
stand
was
trod
by
the
hapless
mary
stuart
her
eye
beheld
the
same
objects
that
mine
now
rests
upon
her
hand
has
touched
the
draperies
i
now
hold
in
mine
these
frail
memorials
remain
but
what
remains
of
scotland
queen
but
a
blighted
name
even
the
chamber
possessed
a
nameless
charm
for
mary
vivid
imagination
she
had
not
entirely
escaped
the
superstitions
of
the
country
in
which
she
had
lived
and
she
readily
yielded
her
assent
to
the
asseverations
of
her
guide
as
to
its
being
the
blood
of
rizzio
which
for
nearly
three
hundred
years
had
resisted
all
human
efforts
to
efface
my
credulity
is
so
harmless
said
she
in
answer
to
her
uncle
attempt
to
laugh
her
out
of
her
belief
that
i
surely
may
be
permitted
to
indulge
it
especially
since
i
confess
i
feel
a
sort
of
indescribable
pleasure
in
it
you
take
a
pleasure
in
the
sight
of
blood
exclaimed
douglas
in
astonishment
you
who
turn
pale
at
sight
of
a
cut
finger
and
shudder
at
a
leg
of
mutton
with
the
juice
in
it
oh
mere
modern
vulgar
blood
is
very
shocking
answered
mary
with
a
smile
but
observe
how
this
is
mellowed
by
time
into
a
tint
that
could
not
offend
the
most
fastidious
fine
lady
besides
added
she
in
a
graver
tone
i
own
i
love
to
believe
in
things
supernatural
it
seems
to
connect
us
more
with
another
world
than
when
everything
is
seen
to
proceed
in
the
mere
ordinary
course
of
nature
as
it
is
called
i
can
not
bear
to
imagine
a
dreary
chasm
betwixt
the
inhabitants
of
this
world
and
beings
of
a
higher
sphere
i
love
to
fancy
myself
surrounded
by
i
wish
to
heaven
you
would
remember
you
are
surrounded
by
rational
beings
and
not
fall
into
such
rhapsodies
said
her
uncle
glancing
at
a
party
who
stood
near
them
jesting
upon
all
the
objects
which
mary
had
been
regarding
with
so
much
veneration
but
come
you
have
been
long
enough
here
let
us
try
whether
a
breeze
on
the
calton
hill
will
not
dispel
these
cobwebs
from
your
brain
the
day
though
cold
was
clear
and
sunny
and
the
lovely
spectacle
before
them
shone
forth
in
all
its
gay
magnificence
the
blue
waters
lay
calm
and
motionless
the
opposite
shores
glowed
in
a
thousand
varied
tints
of
wood
and
plain
rock
and
mountain
cultured
field
and
purple
moor
beneath
the
old
town
reared
its
dark
brow
and
the
new
one
stretched
its
golden
lines
while
all
around
the
varied
charms
of
nature
lay
scattered
in
that
profusion
which
nature
hand
alone
can
bestow
oh
this
is
exquisite
exclaimed
mary
after
along
pause
in
which
she
had
been
riveted
in
admiration
of
the
scene
before
her
and
you
are
in
the
right
my
dear
uncle
the
ideas
which
are
inspired
by
the
contemplation
of
such
a
spectacle
as
this
are
far
oh
how
far
superior
to
those
excited
by
the
mere
works
of
art
there
i
can
at
best
think
but
of
the
inferior
agents
of
providence
here
the
soul
rises
from
nature
up
to
nature
god
upon
my
soul
you
will
be
taken
for
a
methodist
mary
if
you
talk
in
this
manner
said
douglas
with
some
marks
of
disquiet
as
he
turned
round
at
the
salutation
of
a
fat
elderly
gentleman
whom
he
presently
recognised
as
bailie
broadfoot
the
first
salutations
over
douglas
fears
of
mary
having
been
overheard
recurred
and
he
felt
anxious
to
remove
any
unfavourable
impression
with
regard
to
his
own
principles
at
least
from
the
mind
of
the
enlightened
magistrate
your
fine
views
here
have
set
my
niece
absolutely
raving
said
he
with
a
smile
but
i
tell
her
it
is
only
in
romantic
minds
that
fine
scenery
inspires
romantic
ideas
i
daresay
many
of
the
worthy
inhabitants
of
edinburgh
walk
here
with
no
other
idea
than
that
of
sharpening
their
appetites
for
dinner
nae
doot
said
the
bailie
it
a
most
capital
place
for
that
were
it
no
for
that
i
ken
nae
muckle
use
it
would
be
of
you
speak
from
experience
of
its
virtues
in
that
respect
i
suppose
said
douglas
gravely
as
to
that
i
canna
compleen
at
times
to
be
sure
i
am
troubled
with
a
little
kind
of
a
squeamishness
after
our
public
interteenments
but
three
rounds
o
the
hill
sets
a
to
rights
then
observing
mary
eyes
exploring
as
he
supposed
the
town
of
leith
you
see
that
prospeck
to
nae
advantage
the
day
miss
said
he
if
the
glasshouses
had
been
workin
it
would
have
looked
as
weel
again
ye
hae
nae
in
the
highlands
na
na
the
bailie
had
a
share
in
the
concern
and
the
volcanic
clouds
of
smoke
that
issued
from
thence
were
far
more
interesting
subjects
of
speculation
to
him
than
all
the
eruptions
of
vesuvius
or
etna
but
there
was
nothing
to
charm
the
lingering
view
and
he
therefore
proposed
their
taking
a
look
at
bridewell
which
next
to
the
smoke
from
the
he
reckoned
the
object
most
worthy
of
notice
it
was
indeed
deserving
of
the
praises
bestowed
upon
it
and
mary
was
giving
her
whole
attention
to
the
details
of
it
when
she
was
suddenly
startled
by
hearing
her
own
name
wailed
in
piteous
accents
from
one
of
the
lower
cells
and
upon
turning
round
she
discovered
in
the
prisoner
the
son
of
one
of
the
tenants
of
glenfern
duncan
had
been
always
looked
upon
as
a
very
honest
lad
in
the
highlands
but
he
had
left
home
to
push
his
fortune
as
a
pedlar
and
the
temptations
of
the
low
country
having
proved
too
much
for
his
virtue
poor
duncan
as
now
expiating
his
offence
in
durance
vile
i
shall
have
a
pretty
account
of
you
to
carry
to
glenfern
said
douglas
regarding
the
culprit
with
his
sternest
look
oh
sir
it
no
my
faut
answered
duncan
blubbering
bitterly
but
there
nae
freedom
at
a
in
this
country
lord
an
i
war
oot
ane
canna
ca
their
head
their
ain
i
for
ye
canna
lift
the
bouk
o
a
prin
but
they
a
upon
ye
and
a
fresh
burst
of
sorrow
ensued
finding
the
was
of
a
venial
nature
douglas
besought
the
bailie
to
us
his
interest
to
procure
the
enfranchisement
of
this
his
vassal
which
broadfoot
happy
to
oblige
a
good
customer
promised
should
be
obtained
on
the
following
day
and
duncan
emotions
being
rather
clamorous
the
party
found
it
necessary
to
withdraw
and
noo
said
the
bailie
as
they
emerged
from
his
place
of
dole
and
durance
will
ye
step
up
to
the
monument
and
tak
a
rest
and
some
refreshment
rest
and
refreshment
in
a
monument
exclaimed
douglas
excuse
me
my
good
friend
but
we
are
not
inclined
to
bait
there
yet
a
while
the
bailie
did
not
comprehend
the
joke
and
he
proceeded
in
his
own
drawling
humdrum
accent
to
assure
them
that
the
monument
was
a
most
convenient
place
it
was
erected
in
honour
of
lord
neilson
memory
said
he
and
is
let
aff
to
a
pastrycook
and
confectioner
where
you
can
always
find
some
trifles
to
treat
the
ladies
such
as
pies
and
custards
and
berries
and
these
sort
of
things
but
we
passed
an
order
in
the
cooncil
that
there
should
be
naething
of
a
spirituous
nature
introduced
for
if
ance
spirits
got
admittance
there
no
saying
what
might
happen
this
was
a
fact
which
none
of
the
party
were
disposed
to
dispute
and
the
bailie
triumphing
in
his
dominion
over
the
spirits
shuffled
on
before
to
do
the
honours
of
this
place
appropriated
at
one
and
the
same
time
to
the
manes
of
a
hero
and
the
making
of
minced
pies
the
regale
was
admirable
and
mary
could
not
help
thinking
times
were
improved
and
that
it
was
a
better
thing
to
eat
tarts
in
lord
nelson
monument
than
to
have
been
poisoned
in
julius
caesar
chapter
xxxiv
having
a
tongue
rough
as
a
cat
and
biting
like
an
adder
and
all
their
reproofs
are
direct
scoldings
their
common
intercourse
is
open
contumely
jeremy
taylor
though
last
not
least
of
nature
works
i
must
now
introduce
you
to
a
friend
of
mine
said
douglas
as
the
bailie
having
made
his
bow
they
bent
their
steps
towards
the
castle
hill
violet
macshake
is
an
aunt
of
my
mother
whom
you
must
often
have
heard
of
and
the
last
remaining
branch
of
the
noble
race
of
girnachgowl
i
am
afraid
she
is
rather
a
formidable
person
then
said
mary
her
uncle
hesitated
no
not
formidable
only
rather
particular
as
all
old
people
are
but
she
is
very
i
understand
in
other
words
she
is
very
disagreeable
all
people
i
observe
have
the
character
of
being
or
else
all
good
people
are
i
ca
tell
which
it
is
more
than
reputation
with
her
said
douglas
somewhat
angrily
for
she
is
in
reality
a
very
woman
as
i
experienced
when
a
boy
at
college
many
a
crown
piece
and
i
used
to
get
from
her
many
a
scold
to
be
sure
went
along
with
them
but
that
i
daresay
i
deserved
besides
she
is
very
rich
and
i
am
her
reputed
heir
therefore
gratitude
and
combine
to
render
her
extremely
amiable
in
my
estimation
they
had
now
reached
the
airy
dwelling
where
macshake
resided
and
having
rung
the
door
was
at
length
most
deliberately
opened
by
an
ancient
female
who
ushered
them
into
an
apartment
the
of
which
struck
a
chill
to
mary
heart
it
was
a
room
with
a
bare
sufficiency
of
and
lank
haircloth
chairs
ranged
in
high
order
round
the
walls
although
the
season
was
advanced
and
the
air
piercing
cold
the
grate
stood
smiling
in
all
the
charms
of
polished
steel
and
the
mistress
of
the
mansion
was
seated
by
the
side
of
it
in
an
still
in
its
summer
position
she
appeared
to
have
no
other
occupation
than
what
her
own
meditations
afforded
for
a
single
glance
sufficed
to
show
that
not
a
vestige
of
book
or
work
was
harboured
there
she
was
a
tall
woman
whom
even
time
iron
hands
scarcely
bent
as
she
merely
stooped
at
the
shoulders
she
had
a
drooping
snuffy
nose
a
long
chin
small
quick
gray
eyes
and
her
face
projected
far
beyond
her
figure
with
an
expression
of
shrewd
restless
curiosity
she
wore
a
mode
not
bonnet
and
cardinal
of
the
same
a
pair
of
clogs
over
her
shoes
and
black
silk
mittens
on
her
arms
as
soon
as
she
recognised
douglas
she
welcomed
him
with
much
cordiality
shook
him
long
and
heartily
by
the
hand
patted
him
on
the
back
looked
into
his
face
with
much
seeming
satisfaction
and
in
short
gave
all
the
demonstrations
of
gladness
usual
with
gentlewomen
of
a
certain
age
her
pleasure
however
appeared
to
be
rather
an
than
an
habitual
feeling
for
as
the
surprise
wore
off
her
visage
resumed
its
harsh
and
sarcastic
expression
and
she
seemed
eager
to
efface
any
agreeable
impression
her
reception
might
have
excited
an
wha
thought
o
seein
ye
enow
said
she
in
a
quick
gabbling
voice
what
brought
you
to
the
toon
are
ye
come
to
spend
our
honest
siller
ere
he
weel
cauld
in
his
grave
puir
man
douglas
explained
that
it
was
upon
account
of
his
niece
health
health
repeated
she
with
a
sardonic
smile
it
wad
mak
an
ool
laugh
to
hear
the
wark
that
made
aboot
young
fowk
health
i
wonder
what

ye

and
whilk
o
ye

to

health
he
he
mary
glad
of
a
pretence
to
in
indulge
the
mirth
the
old
lady
manner
and
appearance
had
excited
joined
most
heartily
in
the
laugh
tak

me
see
ye

wha

tell
what

ye

wi

then
after
taking
an
accurate
survey
of
her

she
pushed
aside
her
pelisse
weel
it
ae

i

ye

neither

but
i
was
at
nae
loss
by
aw
accounts
you
have
not
asked
after
any
of
your
glenfern
friends
said
douglas
hoping
to
touch
a
more
sympathetic
chord
time
eneugh
wull
ye
let
me
draw
my
breath
man
fowk
canna
say
awthing

o

he
he
he
has
begun
life
under
very
melancholy
auspices
poor
fellow
said
douglas
in
allusion
to
his
father
death
an
wha
faut
was
that
i
heard
tell
the
like
to
hae
the
bairn
kirsened
an
its
grandfather
deein
but
fowk
are
naither
born
nor
kirsened
nor
do
they
wad
or
dee
as
they
used
to
du
changed
you
must
indeed
have
witnessed
many
changes
observed
douglas
rather
at
a
loss
how
to
utter
anything
of
a
conciliatory
nature
changes
weel
a
wat
i
sometimes
wonder
if
it

if

upon
my
shoothers
but
with
these
changes
you
must
also
have
seen
many
improvements
said
mary
in
a
tone
of
diffidence
impruvements
turning
sharply
round
upon
her
what
ken
ye
about
impruvements
bairn
a
bony
impruvement
or
ens
no
to

tyleyors
and

jewks
an

an
that
great
glowrin
new

there
pointing
out
of
her
windows
whar
i
used
to
sit
an

oot
at
bonny
green
parks
and
see
the
coos

what

i
noo
but
stane
an
lime
an
stoor
an
dirt
an
idle
cheels
madams
prancin
impruvements
indeed
mary
found
she
was
not
likely
to
advance
her
uncle
fortune
by
the
judiciousness
of
her
remarks
therefore
prudently
resolved
to
hazard
no
more
douglas
who
was
more
to
the
prejudices
of
old
age
and
who
was
always
amused
with
her
bitter
remarks
when
they
did
not
touch
himself
encouraged
her
to
continue
the
conversation
by
some
observation
on
the
prevailing
manners
mainers
repeated
she
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
what
caw
ye
mainers
noo
for
i

an

reteeners
an

aw
trummelt
i
the
presence
o

here
a
long
pinch
of
snuff
caused
a
pause
in
the
old
lady
harangue
but
after
having
duly
wiped
her
nose
with
her
coloured
handkerchief
and
shook
off
all
the
particles
that
might
be
presumed
to
have
lodged
upon
her
cardinal
she
resumed
an
nae

o

tu
that

what
takin
ye
awa

on

said
douglas
seeing
mary
was
too
much
frightened
to
answer
for
herself
on
the
contrary
mary
declares
she
will
never
marry
any
but
a
true
highlander
one
who
wears
the
dirk
and
plaid
and
has
the
and
the
nuptials
are
to
be
celebrated
with
all
the
pomp
of
feudal
times
with
bagpipes
and
bonfires
and
gatherings
of
clans
and
roasted
sheep
and
barrels
of
whisky
and
weel
a
wat
an
she
i
the
right
there
interrupted
macshake
with
more
complacency
than
she
had
yet
shown
they
may
caw
them
what
they
like
but
there
nae
waddins
noo
wha
the
better
o
them

i
the
hiddlins
way
they
gang
aboot

noo
i

you
remember
these
things
done
in
a
very
different
style
said
douglas
i
dinna
mind
them
whan
the
war
at
he
best
but
i
hae
heard
my
mither
tell
what
a

there
as

at

for

till
they
hardly

than
they
did
nae

a

i
thae
he
the

admirably

said
douglas
with
much
solemnity
the
christening

next
distinguished
event
in

then
observing
the
indignation
that

an
so

a
ploy
for
the

nae

douglas
here

compliments
upon

pretty
graciously

added
that

douglas
had
borne
the
various
indignities
levelled
against
himself
and
his
family
with
a
philosophy
that
had
no
parallel
in
his
life
before
but
to
this
attack
upon
his
game
he
was
not
proof
his
colour
rose
his
eyes
flashed
fire
and
something
resembling
an
oath
burst
from
his
lips
as
he
strode
indignantly
towards
the
door
his
friend
however
was
too
nimble
for
him
she
stepped
before
him
and
breaking
into
a
discordant
laugh
as
she
patted
him
on

she
pulled
mary
into
an
adjoining
bedchamber
which
wore
the

aspect
of
chilly
neatness
as
the
one
they
had
quitted

pulling
a
huge
bunch
of
keys
from

she
opened

as
ye

to
be
with
a
facetious
grin
to
her
mollified
favourite
as
they
shook

and
parted
well
how
do
you
like
macshake
mary
asked
her
uncle
as
they
walked
home
that
is
a
cruel
question
uncle
answered
she
with
a
smile
my
gratitude
and
my
taste
are
at
such
variance
displaying
her
splendid
gift
that
i
know
not
how
to
reconcile
them
that
is
always
the
case
with
those
whom
macshake
has
obliged
returned
douglas
she
does
many
liberal
things
but
in
so
ungracious
a
manner
that
people
are
never
sure
whether
they
are
obliged
or
insulted
by
her
but
the
way
in
which
she
receives
kindness
is
still
worse
could
anything
equal
her
impertinence
about
my
roebuck
faith
i
a
good
mind
never
to
enter
her
door
again
mary
could
scarcely
preserve
her
gravity
at
her
uncle
indignation
which
seemed
so
disproportioned
to
the
cause
but
to
turn
the
current
of
his
ideas
she
remarked
that
he
had
certainly
been
at
pains
to
select
two
admirable
specimens
of
her
countrywomen
for
her
i
do
think
i
shall
soon
forget
either
gawffaw
or
mrs
macshake
said
she
laughing
i
hope
you
wo
carry
away
the
impression
that
these
two
specimens
of
scotchwomen
said
her
uncle
the
former
indeed
is
rather
a
sort
of
weed
that
infests
every
soil
the
latter
to
be
sure
is
an
indigenous
plant
i
question
if
she
would
have
arrived
at
such
perfection
in
a
more
cultivated
field
or
genial
clime
she
was
born
at
a
time
when
scotland
was
very
different
from
what
it
is
now
female
education
was
little
attended
to
even
in
families
of
the
highest
rank
consequently
the
ladies
of
those
days
possess
a
in
their
manners
and
ideas
that
we
should
vainly
seek
for
in
this
age
of
cultivation
and
refinement
had
your
time
permitted
you
could
have
seen
much
good
society
here
superior
perhaps
to
what
is
to
be
found
anywhere
else
as
far
as
mental
cultivation
is
concerned
but
you
will
have
leisure
for
that
when
you
return
mary
acquiesced
with
a
sigh
was
to
her
still
a
word
it
reminded
her
of
all
she
had
left
of
the
anguish
of
separation
the
dreariness
of
absence
and
all
these
painful
feelings
were
renewed
in
their
utmost
bitterness
when
the
time
approached
for
her
to
bid
adieu
to
her
uncle
lord
courtland
carriage
and
two
servants
awaited
her
and
the
following

mind
is
the
result
of
observation
matured
by
time
the
journey
like
most
modern
journeys
was
performed
in
comfort
and
safety
and
late
one
evening
mary
found
herself
at
the
goal
of
her
wishes
at
the
threshold
of
the
house
that
contained
her
mother
one
idea
filled
her
mind
but
that
idea
called
up
a
thousand
emotions
i
am
now
to
meet
my
mother
thought
she
and
unconscious
of
everything
else
she
was
assisted
from
the
carriage
and
conducted
into
the
house
a
door
was
thrown
open
but
shrinking
from
the
glare
of
light
and
sound
of
voices
that
assailed
her
he
stood
dazzled
and
dismayed
till
she
beheld
a
figure
approaching
that
she
guessed
to
be
her
mother
her
heart
beat
violently
a
film
was
upon
her
eyes
she
made
an
effort
to
reach
her
mother
arms
and
sank
lifeless
on
her
bosom
lady
juliana
for
such
it
was
doubted
not
but
that
her
daughter
was
really
dead
for
though
he
talked
of
fainting
every
hour
of
the
day
herself
still
what
is
emphatically
called
a
was
a
spectacle
no
less
strange
than
shocking
to
her
she
was
therefore
sufficiently
alarmed
and
overcome
to
behave
in
a
very
interesting
manner
and
some
yearnings
of
pity
even
possessed
her
heart
as
she
beheld
her
daughter
lifeless
form
extended
before
her
her
beautiful
though
inanimate
features
half
hid
by
the
profusion
of
golden
ringlets
that
fell
around
her
but
these
kindly
feelings
were
of
short
duration
for
no
sooner
was
the
nature
of
her
daughter
insensibility
as
ascertained
than
all
her
former
hostility
returned
as
she
found
everyone
attention
directed
to
mary
and
she
herself
entirely
overlooked
in
the
general
interest
she
had
excited
and
her
displeasure
was
still
further
increased
as
mary
at
length
slowly
unclosing
her
eyes
stretched
out
her
hands
and
faintly
articulated
my
mother
mother
what
a
hideous
vulgar
appellation
thought
the
fashionable
parent
to
herself
and
instead
of
answering
her
daughter
appeal
she
hastily
proposed
that
she
should
be
conveyed
to
her
own
apartment
then
summoning
her
maid
she
consigned
her
to
her
care
slightly
touching
her
cheek
as
she
wished
her
and
returned
to
the
adelaide
too
resumed
her
station
at
the
harp
as
if
nothing
had
happened
but
lady
emily
attended
her
cousin
to
her
room
embraced
her
again
and
again
as
she
assured
her
she
loved
her
already
she
was
so
like
her
dear
edward
then
after
satisfying
herself
that
everything
was
comfortable
affectionately
kissed
her
and
withdrew
bodily
fatigue
got
the
better
of
mental
agitation
and
mary
slept
soundly
and
awoke
refreshed
can
it
be
thought
she
as
she
tried
to
collect
her
bewildered
thoughts
can
it
be
that
i
have
really
beheld
my
mother
that
i
have
been
pressed
to
her
heart
that
she
has
shed
tears
over
me
while
i
lay
unconscious
in
her
arms
mother
what
a
delightful
sound
and
how
beautiful
she
seemed
yet
i
have
no
distinct
idea
of
her
my
head
was
so
confused
but
i
have
a
vague
recollection
of
something
very
fair
and
beautiful
and
covered
with
silver
drapery
and
flowers
and
with
the
sweetest
voice
in
the
world
yet
that
must
be
too
young
for
my
mother
perhaps
it
was
my
sister
and
my
mother
was
too
much
overcome
to
meet
her
stranger
child
oh
how
happy
must
i
be
with
such
a
mother
and
sister
in
these
delightful
cogitations
mary
remained
till
lady
emily
entered
how
well
you
look
this
morning
my
dear
cousin
said
she
flying
to
her
you
are
much
more
like
my
edward
than
you
were
last
night
ah
and
you
have
got
his
smile
too
you
must
let
me
see
that
very
often
i
am
sure
i
shall
have
cause
said
mary
returning
her
affectionate
embrace
but
at
present
i
feel
anxious
about
my
mother
and
sister
the
agitation
of
our
meeting
and
my
weakness
i
fear
it
has
been
too
much
for
them
and
she
looked
earnest
in
lady
emily
face
for
a
confirmation
of
her
fears
indeed
you
need
be
under
no
uneasiness
on
their
account
returned
her
cousin
with
her
usual
bluntness
their
feelings
are
not
so
easily
disturbed
you
will
see
them
both
at
breakfast
so
come
along
the
room
was
empty
and
again
mary
sensitive
heart
trembled
for
the
welfare
of
those
already
so
dear
to
her
but
lady
emily
did
not
appear
to
understand
the
nature
of
her
feelings
have
a
little
patience
my
dear
said
she
with
something
of
an
impatient
tone
as
she
rang
for
breakfast
they
will
be
here
at
their
usual
time
nobody
in
this
house
is
a
slave
to
hours
or
each
other
society
liberty
is
the
motto
here
everybody
breakfasts
when
and
where
they
please
lady
juliana
i
believe
frequently
takes
hers
in
her
papa
never
is
visible
till
two
or
three
and
adelaide
is
always
late
what
a
selfish
thing
is
grandeur
thought
mary
as
lady
emily
and
she
sat
like
two
specks
in
the
splendid
saloon
surrounded
by
all
that
wealth
could
purchase
or
luxury
invent
and
her
thoughts
reverted
to
the
pious
thanksgiving
and
affectionate
meeting
that
graced
their
social
meal
in
the
sweet
sunny
parlour
at
lochmarlie
some
of
those
airy
nothings
without
a
local
habitation
who
are
always
to
be
found
flitting
about
the
mansions
of
the
great
now
lounged
into
the
room
and
soon
after
adelaide
made
her
mary
trembling
violently
was
ready
to
fall
upon
her
sister
neck
but
adelaide
seemed
prepared
to
repel
everything
like
a
with
a
cold
but
sweet
i
hope
you
are
better
this
morning
she
seated
herself
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
mary
blood
rushed
back
to
her
heart
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
knew
not
why
for
she
could
not
analyse
the
feelings
that
swelled
in
her
bosom
she
would
have
shuddered
to
her
sister
unkind
but
she
she
was
so
it
can
only
be
the
difference
of
our
manners
sighed
she
to
herself
i
am
sure
my
sister
loves
me
though
she
does
not
show
it
in
the
same
way
i
should
have
done
and
she
gazed
with
the
purest
admiration
and
tenderness
on
the
matchless
beauty
of
her
face
and
form
never
had
she
beheld
anything
so
exquisitely
beautiful
and
she
longed
to
throw
herself
into
her
sister
arms
and
tell
her
how
she
loved
her
but
adelaide
seemed
to
think
the
present
company
wholly
unworthy
of
her
regard
for
after
having
received
the
adulation
of
the
gentlemen
as
they
severally
paid
her
a
profusion
of
compliments
upon
her
appearance
desire
tomkins
said
she
to
a
footman
to
ask
lady
juliana
for
the
post
and
the
second
volume
of
of
the
french
novel
i
am
reading
and
say
she
shall
have
it
again
when
i
have
finished
it
in
what
different
terms
people
may
express
the
same
meaning
thought
mary
had
i
been
sending
a
message
to
my
mother
i
should
have
expressed
myself
quite
differently
but
no
doubt
my
sister
meaning
is
the
same
though
she
may
not
use
the
same
words
the
servant
returned
with
the
newspaper
and
the
novel
would
be
sent
when
it
could
be
found
lady
juliana
never
reads
like
anybody
else
said
her
daughter
she
is
for
ever
mislaying
books
she
has
lost
the
first
volumes
of
the
two
last
novels
that
came
from
town
before
i
had
even
seen
then
this
was
uttered
in
the
softest
sweetest
tone
imaginable
and
as
if
she
had
been
pronouncing
a
panegyric
mary
was
more
and
more
puzzled
can
be
my
sister
meaning
here
thought
she
the
words
seemed
almost
to
imply
censure
but
that
voice
and
smile
speak
the
sweetest
praise
how
truly
douglas
warned
me
never
to
judge
of
people
by
their
words
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
three
or
four
dogs
rushed
in
followed
by
lady
juliana
with
a
volume
of
a
novel
in
her
hand
again
mary
found
herself
assailed
by
a
variety
of
powerful
emotions
she
attempted
to
rise
but
pale
and
breathless
she
sank
back
in
her
chair
her
agitation
was
unmarked
by
her
mother
who
did
not
even
appear
to
be
sensible
of
her
presence
for
with
a
graceful
bend
of
her
head
to
the
company
in
general
she
approached
adelaide
and
putting
her
lips
to
her
forehead
how
do
you
do
love
i
afraid
you
are
very
angry
with
me
about
that
teazing
la
ca
conceive
where
it
can
be
but
here
is
the
third
volume
which
is
much
prettier
than
the
second
i
certainly
shall
not
read
the
third
volume
before
the
second
said
adelaide
with
her
usual
serenity
then
i
shall
order
another
copy
from
town
my
love
or
i
daresay
i
could
tell
you
the
story
of
the
second
volume
it
is
not
at
all
interesting
i
assure
you
hermilisde
you
know
but
i
forget
where
the
first
volume
left
off
then
directing
her
eyes
to
mary
who
had
summoned
strength
to
rise
and
was
slowly
venturing
to
approach
her
she
extended
a
finger
towards
her
mary
eagerly
seized
her
mother
hand
and
pressed
it
with
fervour
to
her
lips
then
hid
her
face
on
her
shoulder
to
conceal
the
tears
that
burst
from
her
eyes
absurd
my
dear
said
her
ladyship
in
a
peevish
tone
as
she
disengaged
herself
from
her
daughter
you
must
really
get
the
better
of
this
foolish
weakness
these
are
too
much
for
me
i
was
most
excessively
shocked
last
night
i
assure
you
and
you
ought
not
to
have
quitted
your
room
poor
mary
tears
congealed
in
her
eyes
at
this
tender
salutation
and
she
raised
her
head
as
if
to
as
certain
whether
it
really
proceeded
from
her
mother
but
instead
of
the
angelic
vision
she
had
pictured
to
herself
she
beheld
a
face
which
though
once
handsome
now
conveyed
no
pleasurable
feeling
to
the
heart
late
hours
bad
temper
and
rouge
had
done
much
to
impair
lady
beauty
there
still
remained
enough
to
dazzle
a
superficial
observer
but
not
to
satisfy
the
eye
used
to
the
expression
of
all
the
best
affections
of
the
soul
mary
almost
shrank
from
the
peevish
inanity
portrayed
on
her
mother
visage
as
a
glance
of
the
mind
contrasted
it
with
the
mild
eloquence
of
douglas
countenance
and
abashed
and
disappointed
she
remained
mournfully
silent
where
is
dr
redgill
demanded
lady
juliana
of
the
company
in
general
he
has
got
scent
of
a
turtle
at
admiral
yellowchops
answered
how
vastly
provoking
rejoined
her
ladyship
that
he
should
be
out
of
the
way
the
only
time
i
have
wished
to
see
him
since
he
came
to
the
house
who
is
this
favoured
individual
whose
absence
you
are
so
pathetically
lamenting
julia
asked
lord
courtland
as
he
indolently
sauntered
into
the
room
that
disagreeable
redgill
he
has
gone
somewhere
to
eat
turtle
at
the
very
time
i
wished
to
consult
him
about
the
propriety
of
introducing
a
new
niece
to
your
lordship
said
lady
emily
as
with
affected
solemnity
she
introduced
mary
to
her
uncle
lady
juliana
frowned
the
earl
smiled
saluted
his
niece
hoped
she
had
recovered
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
remarked
it
was
very
cold
and
then
turned
to
a
parrot
humming
pretty
poll
say
etc
such
was
mary
first
introduction
to
her
family
and
those
only
who
have
felt
what
it
was
to
have
the
genial
current
of
their
souls
chilled
by
neglect
or
changed
by
unkindness
can
sympathise
in
the
feelings
of
wounded
affection
when
the
overflowings
of
a
generous
heart
are
confined
within
the
narrow
limits
of
its
own
bosom
and
the
offerings
of
love
are
rudely
rejected
by
the
hand
most
dear
to
us
mary
was
too
much
intimidated
by
her
mother
manner
towards
her
to
give
way
in
her
presence
to
the
emotions
that
agitated
her
but
she
followed
her
sister
steps
as
she
quitted
the
room
and
throwing
her
arms
around
her
sobbed
in
a
voice
almost
choked
with
the
excess
of
her
feelings
my
sister
love
me
love
me
but
adelaide
heart
seared
by
selfishness
and
vanity
was
incapable
of
loving
anything
in
which
self
had
no
share
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
felt
awkward
and
embarrassed
her
sister
streaming
eyes
and
supplicating
voice
spoke
a
language
to
which
she
was
a
stranger
for
art
is
ever
averse
to
recognise
the
accents
of
nature
still
less
is
it
capable
of
replying
to
them
and
adelaide
could
only
wonder
at
her
agitation
and
think
how
unpleasant
it
was
and
say
something
about
overcome
and
and
composure
which
was
all
lost
upon
mary
as
she
hung
upon
her
neck
every
feeling
wrought
to
its
highest
tone
by
the
complicated
nature
of
those
emotions
which
swelled
her
heart
at
length
making
an
effort
to
regain
her
composure
forgive
me
my
sister
said
she
this
is
very
foolish
to
weep
when
i
ought
to
rejoice
and
i
do
rejoice
and
i
know
i
shall
be
so
happy
yet
but
in
spite
of
the
faint
smile
that
accompanied
her
words
tears
again
burst
from
her
eyes
i
am
sure
i
shall
have
infinite
pleasure
in
your
society
replied
adelaide
with
her
usual
sweetness
and
placidity
as
she
replaced
a
ringlet
in
its
proper
position
but
i
have
unluckily
an
engagement
at
this
time
you
will
however
be
at
no
loss
for
amusement
you
will
find
musical
instruments
there
pointing
to
an
adjacent
apartment
and
here
are
new
publications
and
of
drawings
you
will
perhaps
like
to
look
over
and
so
saying
she
disappeared
musical
instruments
and
new
publications
repeated
mary
mechanically
to
herself
what
have
i
to
do
with
them
oh
for
one
kind
word
from
my
mother
lips
one
kind
glance
from
my
sister
eye
and
she
remained
overwhelmed
with
the
weight
of
those
emotions
which
instead
of
pouring
into
the
hearts
of
others
she
was
compelled
to
concentrate
in
her
own
her
mournful
reveries
were
interrupted
by
her
kind
friend
lady
emily
but
mary
deemed
her
sorrow
too
sacred
to
be
betrayed
even
to
her
and
therefore
rallying
her
spirits
she
strove
to
enter
into
those
schemes
of
amusement
suggested
by
her
cousin
for
passing
the
day
but
she
found
herself
unable
for
such
continued
exertion
and
hearing
a
large
party
was
expected
to
dinner
she
retired
in
spite
of
lady
emily
remonstrance
to
her
own
apartment
where
she
sought
a
refuge
from
her
thoughts
in
writing
to
her
friends
at
glenfern
lady
juliana
looked
in
upon
her
as
she
passed
to
dinner
she
was
in
a
better
humour
for
she
had
received
a
new
dress
which
was
particularly
becoming
as
both
her
maid
and
her
glass
had
attested
again
mary
heart
bounded
towards
the
being
to
whom
she
owed
her
birth
yet
afraid
to
give
utterance
to
her
feelings
she
could
only
regard
her
with
silent
admiration
till
a
moment
consideration
converted
that
into
a
less
pleasing
feeling
as
she
observed
for
the
first
time
that
her
mother
wore
no
mourning
lady
juliana
saw
her
astonishment
and
little
guessing
the
cause
was
flattered
by
it
your
style
of
dress
is
very
obsolete
my
dear
said
she
as
she
contrasted
the
effect
of
her
own
figure
and
her
in
a
large
mirror
and
there
no
occasion
for
you
to
wear
black
here
i
shall
desire
my
woman
to
order
some
things
for
you
though
perhaps
there
wo
be
much
occasion
as
your
stay
here
is
to
be
short
and
of
course
you
wo
think
of
going
out
at
all
you
will
find
it
dull
here
by
yourself
wo
you
i
shall
leave
you
my
darling
blanche
for
companion
kissing
a
little
french
as
she
laid
it
in
lap
only
you
must
be
very
careful
of
her
and
coax
her
and
be
very
very
good
to
her
for
i
would
not
have
my
sweetest
blanche
vexed
not
for
the
world
and
with
another
long
and
tender
salute
to
her
dog
and
a
my
dear
to
her
daughter
she
quitted
her
to
display
her
charms
to
a
brilliant
leaving
mary
to
solace
herself
in
her
solitary
chamber
with
the
whines
of
a
discontented
chapter

along
with
it
the

soon
repels
its
deadening
weight
the
firmness
of

resists
its
weakening
influence
the
torpor
of
old
age
is
insensible
to
its
most
acute
pangs
in
spite
of
the
disappointment
she
had
experienced
the
preceding
day
mary
arose
the
following
morning
with
fresh
hopes
of
happiness
springing
in
her
heart
what
a
fool
i
was
thought
she
to
view
so
seriously
what
after
all
must
be
merely
difference
of
manner
and
how
illiberal
to
expect
every
one
manners
should
accord
exactly
with
my
ideas
but
now
that
i
have
got
over
the
first
impression
i
daresay
i
shall
find
everybody
quite
amiable
and
delightful
and
mary
quickly
reasoned
herself
into
the
belief
that
she
only
could
have
been
to
blame
with
renovated
spirits
she
therefore
joined
her
cousin
and
accompanied
her
to
the
breakfasting
saloon
the
visitors
had
all
departed
but
redgill
had
returned
and
seemed
to
be
at
the
winding
up
of
a
solitary
but
voluminous
meal
he
was
a
very
tall
corpulent
man
with
a
projecting
front
large
purple
nose
and
a
profusion
of
chin
good
morning
ladies
mumbled
he
with
a
full
mouth
as
he
made
a
feint
of
from
his
chair
lady
emily
your
servant
miss
douglas
i
presume
hem
allow
me
to
pull
the
bell
for
your
ladyship
as
he
sat
without
stirring
hand
or
foot
then
after
it
was
done
my
honour
lady
emily
this
is
not
using
me
well
why
did
you
not
desire
me
and
you
are
so
nimble
i
defy
any
man
to
get
the
start
of
you
i
know
you
have
been
upon
hard
service
doctor
and
therefore
i
humanely
wished
to
spare
you
any
additional
fatigue
replied
lady
emily
fatigue
phoo
i
sure
i
mind
fatigue
as
little
as
any
man
besides
it
really
nothing
to
speak
of
i
have
merely
rode
from
my
friend
admiral
yellowchops
this
morning
i
hope
you
passed
a
pleasant
day
there
yesterday
so
so
very
so
so
returned
the
doctor
drily
only
so
so
and
a
turtle
in
the
case
exclaimed
lady
emily
phoo
as
to
that
the
turtle
was
neither
here
nor
there
i
value
turtle
as
little
as
any
man
you
may
be
sure
it
was
for
that
i
went
to
see
my
old
friend
yellowchops
it
happened
indeed
that
there
a
turtle
and
a
very
well
dressed
one
too
but
where
five
and
thirty
people
one
half
of
them
ladies
who
of
course
are
always
helped
first
sit
down
to
dinner
there
an
end
of
all
rational
happiness
in
my
opinion
but
at
a
turtle
feast
you
have
surely
something
much
better
you
know
you
may
have
rational
happiness
any
day
over
a
i
beg
your
pardon
that
not
such
an
easy
matter
i
can
assure
you
it
is
a
work
of
no
small
skill
to
dress
a
handsomely
and
moreover
to
eat
it
in
perfection
a
man
must
eat
it
by
himself
if
once
you
come
to
exchange
words
over
it
it
is
useless
i
once
saw
the
finest
steak
i
ever
clapped
my
eyes
upon
completely
ruined
by
one
silly
scoundrel
asking
another
if
he
liked
fat
if
he
liked
fat
what
a
question
for
one
rational
being
to
ask
another
the
fact
is
a
is
like
a
woman
reputation
if
once
it
is
breathed
upon
it
good
for
nothing
one
of
the
stories
with
which
my
nurse
used
to
amuse
my
childhood
said
mary
was
that
of
having
seen
an
itinerant
conjuror
dress
a
on
his
tongue
the
doctor
suspended
the
morsel
he
was
carrying
to
his
mouth
and
for
the
first
time
regarded
mary
with
looks
of
unfeigned
admiration
my
honour
and
that
was
as
clever
a
trick
as
ever
i
heard
of
you
are
a
wonderful
people
you
scotch
a
very
wonderful
people
but
pray
was
she
at
any
pains
to
examine
the
fellow
tongue
i
imagine
not
said
mary
i
suppose
the
love
of
science
was
not
strong
enough
to
make
her
run
the
risk
of
burning
her
fingers
it
a
thousand
pities
said
the
doctor
as
he
dropped
his
chin
with
an
air
of
disappointment
i
am
surprised
none
of
your
scotch
got
hold
of
the
fellow
and
squeezed
the
secret
out
of
him
it
might
have
proved
an
important
discovery
a
very
important
discovery
and
your
scotch
are
not
apt
to
let
anything
escape
them
a
very
searching
shrewd
people
as
ever
i
knew
and
that
the
only
way
to
arrive
at
knowledge
a
man
must
be
of
a
stirring
mind
if
he
expects
to
do
good
a
poor
woman
below
wishes
to
se
you
sir
said
a
servant
these
poor
women
are
perfect
pests
to
society
said
the
doctor
as
his
nose
assumed
a
still
darker
hue
there
is
no
resting
upon
one
seat
for
them
always
something
the
matter
the
burn
and
bruise
and
hack
themselves
and
their
brats
one
would
really
think
on
purpose
to
give
trouble
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
of
it
said
lady
emily
they
must
find
your
sympathy
so
soothing
as
to
that
lady
emily
if
you
know
as
much
about
poor
women
as
i
do
you
would
think
so
much
of
them
as
you
do
take
my
word
for
it
they
are
one
and
all
of
them
a
very
greedy
ungrateful
set
and
require
to
be
kept
at
a
distance
and
also
to
be
kept
waiting
as
poor
people
time
is
their
only
wealth
i
observe
you
generally
make
them
pay
a
pretty
large
fee
in
that
way
that
is
really
not
what
i
would
have
expected
from
you
lady
emily
i
must
take
the
liberty
to
say
your
ladyship
does
me
the
greatest
injustice
you
must
be
sensible
how
ready
i
am
to
fly
rising
as
if
he
had
been
glued
to
his
chair
when
there
is
any
real
danger
i
sure
it
was
only
last
week
i
got
up
as
soon
as
i
had
swallowed
my
dinner
to
see
a
man
who
had
fallen
down
in
a
fit
and
now
i
am
going
to
this
woman
who
i
daresay
has
nothing
the
matter
with
her
before
my
breakfast
is
well
down
my
throat
who
is
that
gentleman
asked
mary
as
the
doctor
at
length
with
much
reluctance
shuffled
out
of
the
room
he
is
a
sort
of
medical
of
papa
answered
lady
emily
who
for
the
sake
of
good
living
has
got
himself
completely
domesticated
here
he
is
vulgar
selfish
and
as
you
must
already
have
discovered
but
these
are
accounted
his
greatest
perfections
as
papa
like
all
indolent
people
must
be
diverted
and
he
never
is
by
genteel
sensible
people
he
requires
something
more
nothing
fatigues
him
so
much
as
the
conversation
of
a
commonplace
sensible
man
one
who
has
the
skill
to
keep
his
foibles
out
of
sight
now
what
delights
him
in
redgill
there
is
no
any
child
who
runs
may
read
his
character
at
a
glance
it
certainly
does
not
require
much
penetration
said
mary
to
discover
the
doctor
love
of
ease
and
seem
to
be
the
features
of
his
mind
and
he
looks
as
if
when
he
sat
in
an
with
his
toes
on
the
fender
and
his
hands
crossed
he
would
not
have
an
idea
beyond
wonder
what
we
shall
have
for
dinner
i
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
miss
douglas
said
the
doctor
catching
the
last
words
as
he
entered
the
room
and
taking
them
to
be
the
spontaneous
effusions
of
the
speaker
own
heart
i
rejoice
to
hear
you
say
so
suppose
we
send
for
the
bill
of
fare
pulling
the
bell
and
then
to
the
servant
who
answered
the
summons
desire
grillade
to
send
up
his
bill
miss
douglas
wishes
to
see
it
young
ladies
are
much
more
house
wifely
in
scotland
than
they
are
in
this
country
continued
the
doctor
seating
himself
as
close
as
possible
to
mary
at
least
they
were
when
i
knew
scotland
but
not
yesterday
and
it
much
changed
since
then
i
daresay
i
studied
physic
in
edinburgh
and
went
upon
a
the
highlands
was
very
much
pleased
with
what
i
saw
i
assure
you
fine
country
in
some
respects
nature
has
been
very
liberal
mary
heart
leapt
within
her
at
hearing
her
dear
native
land
praised
even
by
redgill
and
her
conscience
smote
her
for
the
harsh
and
hasty
censure
she
had
passed
upon
him
one
who
can
admire
the
scenery
of
the
highlands
thought
she
must
have
a
mind
it
has
always
been
observed
that
only
persons
of
taste
were
capable
of
appreciating
the
peculiar
charms
of
mountain
scenery
a
london
citizen
or
a
lincolnshire
grazier
sees
nothing
but
deformity
in
the
sublime
works
of
nature
reasoned
mary
redgill
must
be
of
a
more
elevated
way
of
thinking
than
i
had
supposed
the
entrance
of
lady
juliana
prevented
her
expressing
the
feelings
that
were
upon
her
lips
but
she
thought
what
pleasure
she
would
have
in
resuming
the
delightful
theme
at
another
opportunity
after
slightly
noticing
her
daughter
and
carefully
adjusting
her
favourites
lady
juliana
began
i
am
anxious
to
consult
you
redgill
upon
the
state
of
this
young
person
you
have
been
excessively
ill
my
dear
have
you
not
my
sweetest
blanche
do
be
quiet
you
had
a
cough
i
think
and
everything
that
was
and
as
her
friends
in
scotland
have
sent
her
to
me
for
a
short
time
entirely
on
account
of
her
health
my
charming
frisk
your
spirits
are
really
too
much
i
think
it
quite
proper
that
she
should
be
confined
to
her
own
apartment
during
the
winter
that
she
may
get
quite
well
and
strong
against
spring
as
to
visiting
or
going
into
company
that
of
course
must
be
quite
out
of
the
question
you
can
tell
redgill
my
dear
all
about
your
complaints
yourself
mary
tried
to
articulate
but
her
feelings
rose
almost
to
suffocation
and
the
words
died
upon
her
lips
your
ladyship
confounds
me
said
the
doctor
pulling
out
his
spectacles
which
after
duly
wiping
he
adjusted
on
his
nose
and
turned
their
beams
full
on
mary
face
i
really
never
should
have
guessed
there
was
anything
the
matter
with
the
young
lady
she
does
look
a
delicate
to
be
colour
too
but
hand
cool
eye
clear
pulse
steady
a
impetuous
but
nothing
and
the
appetite
good
i
own
i
was
surprised
to
see
you
cut
so
good
a
figure
after
the
delicious
meals
you
have
been
accustomed
to
in
the
north
you
must
find
it
miserable
picking
here
an
english
breakfast
glancing
with
contempt
at
the
eggs
muffins
toast
preserves
etc
he
had
collected
round
him
is
really
a
most
insipid
meal
if
i
did
not
make
a
rule
of
rising
early
and
taking
regular
exercise
i
doubt
very
much
if
i
should
be
able
to
swallow
a
nothing
to
whet
the
appetite
here
and
it
the
same
everywhere
as
yellowchops
says
our
breakfasts
are
a
disgrace
to
england
one
would
think
the
whole
nation
was
upon
a
regimen
of
tea
and
toast
from
the
land
end
to
nothing
but
tea
and
toast
your
ladyship
must
really
acknowledge
the
prodigious
advantage
the
scotch
possess
over
us
in
that
respect
i
thought
the
breakfasts
like
everything
else
in
scotland
extremely
disgusting
replied
her
ladyship
with
indignation
ha
well
that
really
amazes
me
the
people
i
give
up
they
are
dirty
and
greedy
the
country
too
is
a
perfect
mass
of
rubbish
and
the
dinners
not
fit
for
dogs
the
cookery
i
mean
as
to
the
materials
they
are
admirable
but
the
breakfasts
that
what
redeems
the
land
and
every
country
has
its
own
peculiar
excellence
in
argyleshire
you
have
the
lochfine
herring
fat
luscious
and
delicious
just
out
of
the
water
falling
to
pieces
with
its
own
richness
melting
away
like
butter
in
your
mouth
in
aberdeenshire
you
have
the
finnan
haddo
with
a
flavour
all
its
own
vastly
relishing
just
salt
enough
to
be
without
parching
you
up
with
thirst
in
perthshire
there
is
the
tay
salmon
kippered
crisp
and
juicy
a
very
magnificent
morsel
a
heavy
but
that
easily
counteracted
by
a
teaspoonful
of
the
athole
whisky
in
other
places
you
have
the
exquisite
mutton
of
the
country
made
into
hams
of
a
most
delicate
flavour
flour
scones
soft
and
white
oatcake
thin
and
crisp
marmalade
and
jams
of
every
description
and
but
i
beg
pardon
your
ladyship
was
upon
the
subject
of
this
young
lady
health
my
honour
i
can
see
little
the
matter
we
were
just
going
to
look
over
the
bill
together
when
your
ladyship
entered
i
see
it
begins
with
that
eternal
and
that
paltry
this
is
the
second
day
within
a
week
monsieur
grillade
has
thought
fit
to
treat
us
with
them
and
it
a
fortnight
yesterday
since
i
have
seen
either
oyster
or
turtle
soup
upon
the
table
my
honour
such
inattention
is
infamous
i
know
lord
courtland
detests
what
the
same
thing
he
quite
indifferent
to
it
for
i
take
indifference
and
dislike
to
be
much
the
same
a
man
indifference
to
his
a
serious
thing
and
so
i
shall
let
monsieur
grillade
know
and
the
doctor
chin
rose
and
fell
like
the
waves
of
the
sea
what
is
the
name
of
the
physician
at
bristol
who
is
so
celebrated
for
consumptive
complaints
asked
lady
juliana
of
adelaide
i
shall
send
for
him
he
is
the
only
person
i
have
any
reliance
upon
i
know
he
always
recommends
confinement
for
consumption
tears
dropped
from
mary
eyes
lady
juliana
regarded
her
with
surprise
and
severity
how
very
tiresome
i
really
ca
stand
these
perpetual
adelaide
my
love
pull
the
bell
for
my
redgill
place
the
screen
there
this
room
is
insufferably
hot
my
dogs
will
literally
be
roasted
alive
and
her
ladyship
fretted
about
in
all
the
perturbation
of
my
honour
i
do
think
the
room
hot
said
the
doctor
who
from
a
certain
want
of
tact
and
capacity
of
intellect
never
comprehended
the
feelings
of
others
i
declare
i
have
felt
it
much
hotter
when
your
ladyship
has
complained
of
the
cold
but
there
no
accounting
for
people
feelings
if
you
would
move
your
seat
a
this
way
i
think
you
would
be
cooler
and
as
to
your
daughter
i
have
repeatedly
desired
redgill
that
you
will
not
use
these
familiar
appellations
when
you
address
me
or
any
of
my
family
interrupted
lady
juliana
with
haughty
indignation
i
beg
pardon
said
the
doctor
nowise
discomposed
at
this
rebuff
well
with
regard
to
miss
miss
this
young
lady
i
assure
your
ladyship
you
need
be
under
no
apprehensions
on
her
account
she
a
nervous
that
all
take
her
about
by
all
means
all
young
ladies
love
to
go
about
and
see
sights
show
her
the
and
the
and
the
shops
and
the
and
the
wild
beasts
and
there
no
fear
of
her
i
never
recommend
confinement
to
man
woman
or
child
it
destroys
the
appetite
and
our
appetite
is
the
best
part
of
us
what
would
we
be
without
appetites
miserable
beings
worse
than
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
away
shuffled
the
doctor
to
admonish
monsieur
grillade
on
the
iniquity
of
neglecting
this
the
noblest
attribute
of
man
it
appears
to
me
excessively
extraordinary
said
lady
juliana
addressing
mary
that
douglas
should
have
alarmed
me
so
much
about
your
health
when
it
seems
there
nothing
the
matter
with
you
she
certainly
showed
very
little
regard
for
my
feelings
i
ca
understand
it
and
i
must
say
if
you
are
not
ill
i
have
been
most
excessively
by
your
scotch
friends
and
with
an
air
of
great
indignation
her
ladyship
swept
out
of
the
room
regardless
of
the
state
into
which
she
had
thrown
her
daughter
poor
mary
feelings
were
now
at
their
climax
and
she
gave
way
to
all
the
repressed
agony
that
swelled
her
heart
lady
emily
who
had
been
amusing
herself
at
the
other
end
of
the
saloon
and
had
heard
nothing
of
what
had
passed
flew
towards
her
at
sight
of
her
suffering
and
eagerly
demanded
of
adelaide
the
cause
i
really
do
know
answered
adelaide
lifting
her
beautiful
eyes
from
her
book
with
the
greatest
composure
lady
juliana
is
always
cross
of
a
morning
oh
no
exclaimed
mary
trying
to
regain
her
composure
the
fault
is
mine
i
i
have
offended
my
mother
i
know
not
how
tell
me
oh
tell
me
how
i
can
obtain
her
forgiveness
obtain
her
forgiveness
repeated
lady
emily
indignantly
for
what
alas
i
know
not
but
in
some
way
i
have
displeased
my
mother
her
looks
her
words
her
manner
all
tell
me
how
dissatisfied
she
is
with
me
while
to
my
sister
and
even
to
her
very
dogs
agitation
choked
her
utterance
if
you
expect
to
be
treated
like
a
dog
you
will
certainly
be
disappointed
said
lady
emily
i
wonder
douglas
did
not
warn
you
of
what
you
had
to
expect
she
must
have
known
something
of
lady
juliana
ways
and
it
would
have
been
as
well
had
you
been
better
prepared
to
encounter
them
mary
looked
hurt
and
making
an
effort
to
conquer
her
emotion
she
said
douglas
never
spoke
of
my
mother
with
disrespect
but
she
did
warn
me
against
expecting
too
much
from
her
affection
she
said
i
had
been
too
long
estranged
from
her
to
have
retained
my
place
in
her
heart
but
still
you
could
not
foresee
the
reception
you
have
me
with
nor
i
neither
did
you
adelaide
lady
juliana
is
sometimes
so
odd
answered
her
daughter
in
her
sweetest
tone
that
i
really
am
seldom
surprised
at
anything
she
does
but
all
this
to
me
perfectly
absurd
as
nobody
minds
anything
she
says
impossible
exclaimed
mary
my
duty
must
ever
be
to
reverence
my
mother
my
study
should
be
to
please
her
if
i
only
knew
how
and
oh
would
she
but
suffer
me
to
love
her
adelaide
regarded
her
sister
for
a
moment
with
a
look
of
surprise
then
rose
and
left
the
room
humming
an
italian
air
lady
emily
remained
with
her
cousin
but
she
was
a
bad
comforter
her
indignation
against
the
oppressor
was
always
much
stronger
than
her
sympathy
with
the
oppressed
and
she
would
have
been
more
in
her
element
scolding
the
mother
than
soothing
the
daughter
but
mary
had
not
been
taught
to
trust
to
mortals
weak
as
herself
for
support
in
the
hour
of
trial
she
knew
her
aid
must
come
from
a
higher
source
and
in
solitude
she
sought
for
consolation
this
must
be
all
for
my
good
sighed
she
else
it
would
not
be
i
had
drawn
too
bright
a
picture
of
happiness
already
it
is
blotted
out
with
my
tears
i
must
set
about
replacing
it
with
one
of
soberer
colours
alas
mary
knew
not
how
many
a
fair
picture
of
human
felicity
had
shared
the
same
fate
as
hers
chapter
iii
they
were
in
sooth
a
most
enchanting
train
skilful
to
unite
with
evil
good
and
strew
with
pleasure
pain
of
in
writing
to
her
maternal
friend
mary
did
not
follow
the
mode
usually
adopted
by
young
ladies
of
the
heroic
cast
viz
that
of
giving
a
minute
and
circumstantial
detail
of
their
own
complete
wretchedness
and
abusing
in
terms
highly
sentimental
every
member
of
the
family
with
whom
they
are
associated
mary
knew
that
to
breathe
a
hint
of
her
own
unhappiness
would
be
to
embitter
the
peace
of
those
she
loved
and
she
therefore
strove
to
conceal
from
their
observation
the
disappointment
she
had
experienced
many
a
sigh
was
heaved
however
and
many
a
tear
was
wiped
away
ere
a
letter
could
be
composed
that
would
carry
pleasure
to
the
dear
group
at
glenfern
she
could
say
nothing
of
her
tenderness
or
her
sister
affection
but
she
dwelt
upon
the
elegance
of
the
one
and
the
beauty
of
the
other
she
could
not
boast
of
the
warmth
of
her
uncle
reception
but
she
praised
his
and
enlarged
upon
lady
emily
kindness
and
attention
even
redgill
admiration
of
scotch
breakfasts
was
given
as
a
for
her
good
old
aunts
i
declare
said
miss
grizzy
as
she
ended
her
fifth
perusal
of
the
letter
mary
must
be
a
happy
creature
everybody
must
allow
indeed
i
never
heard
it
disputed
that
lady
juliana
is
a
most
elegant
being
and
i
daresay
she
is
greatly
improved
since
we
saw
her
for
you
know
that
is
a
long
time
ago
the
mind
may
improve
after
a
certain
age
replied
jacky
with
one
of
her
wisest
looks
but
i
doubt
very
much
if
the
person
does
if
the
inside
had
been
like
the
out
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
improvement
observed
nicky
i
sure
you
are
both
perfectly
right
resumed
the
sapient
grizzy
and
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
but
that
our
dear
niece
is
a
great
deal
wiser
than
when
we
knew
her
nobody
can
deny
but
she
is
a
great
deal
older
and
you
know
people
always
grow
wiser
as
they
grow
older
of
course
they
to
do
it
said
jacky
with
emphasis
but
there
no
fool
like
an
old
fool
quoth
nicky
what
a
delightful
creature
our
charming
niece
adelaide
must
be
from
mary
account
said
grizzy
only
i
ca
conceive
how
her
eyes
come
to
be
black
i
sure
there
not
a
black
eye
amongst
us
the
kilnacroish
family
are
black
to
be
sure
and
was
first
cousin
once
removed
to
our
aunt
by
our
mother
side
it
wonderful
the
length
that
resemblances
run
in
some
old
families
and
i
really
ca
account
for
our
niece
adelaide
black
eyes
naturally
any
other
way
than
just
through
the
kilnacroish
family
for
i
quite
convinced
it
from
us
she
takes
them
children
always
take
their
eyes
from
their
father
side
everybody
knows
that
becky
and
bella
and
baby
are
all
as
like
their
poor
father
as
they
can
stare
there
no
accounting
for
the
varieties
of
the
human
species
said
jacky
and
like
an
ill
mark
observed
nicky
and
only
think
of
her
being
so
much
taller
than
mary
and
twins
i
declare
it
wonderful
i
should
have
thought
indeed
i
never
doubted
that
they
would
have
been
exactly
the
same
size
and
such
a
beautiful
colour
too
when
we
used
to
think
mary
rather
pale
it
very
unaccountable
you
forget
said
jacky
who
had
not
forgot
the
insult
offered
to
her
nursing
system
eighteen
years
before
you
forget
that
i
always
predicted
what
would
happen
i
never
knew
any
good
come
of
change
said
nicky
i
sure
that
very
true
rejoined
grizzy
and
we
have
great
reason
to
thank
our
stars
that
mary
is
not
a
perfect
dwarf
which
i
really
thought
she
would
have
been
for
long
till
she
took
a
shooting
summer
was
a
year
but
she
shoot
no
more
said
jacky
with
a
shake
of
the
head
that
might
have
vied
with
jove
imperial
nod
england
not
the
place
for
shooting
the
englishwomen
are
all
poor
droichs
said
nicky
who
had
seen
three
in
the
course
of
her
life
it
a
great
matter
to
us
all
however
and
to
herself
too
poor
thing
that
mary
should
be
so
happy
resumed
grizzy
i
sure
i
do
know
what
she
would
have
done
if
lord
courtland
had
been
an
harsh
man
which
you
know
he
might
just
as
easily
have
been
and
it
would
really
have
been
very
hard
upon
poor
mary
and
lady
emily
such
a
sweet
creature
too
i
sure
we
must
all
allow
we
have
the
greatest
reason
to
be
thankful
i
do
know
said
jacky
mary
was
petted
enough
before
i
wish
she
may
have
a
head
to
stand
any
more
she
be
ten
times
nicer
than
ever
quoth
nicky
there
is
some
reason
to
be
sure
that
ca
be
denied
to
be
afraid
of
that
at
the
same
time
mary
has
a
great
deal
of
sense
of
her
own
when
she
chooses
and
it
a
great
matter
for
her
and
indeed
for
all
of
us
that
she
is
under
the
eye
of
such
a
sensible
worthy
man
as
that
redgill
of
course
we
may
be
sure
lord
courtland
will
keep
a
most
elegant
table
and
have
a
great
variety
of
sweet
things
which
are
certainly
very
tempting
for
young
people
but
i
have
no
doubt
but
redgill
will
look
after
mary
and
see
that
she
does
eat
too
many
of
them
redgill
must
be
a
very
superior
man
pronounced
jacky
in
her
most
magisterial
manner
if
i
could
hear
of
a
private
opportunity
exclaimed
nicky
in
a
transport
of
generosity
i
would
send
him
one
of
our
hams
and
a
nice
little
pig
of
butter
the
english
are
all
great
people
for
butter
the
proposal
was
hailed
with
rapture
by
both
sisters
in
a
breath
and
it
was
finally
settled
that
to
those
tender
pledges
of
nicky
grizzy
should
add
a
box
of
lady
maclaughlan
latest
invented
pills
while
miss
jacky
was
to
compose
the
epistle
that
was
to
accompany
them
the
younger
set
of
aunts
were
astonished
that
mary
had
said
nothing
about
lovers
and
offers
of
marriage
as
they
had
always
considered
going
to
england
as
synonymous
with
going
to
be
married
to
douglas
more
discerning
eye
mary
happiness
did
not
appear
in
so
dazzling
a
light
as
to
the
weaker
optics
of
her
aunts
it
is
not
like
my
mary
thought
she
to
rest
so
much
on
mere
external
advantages
surely
her
warm
affectionate
heart
can
not
be
satisfied
with
the
of
a
mother
and
the
of
a
sister
these
she
might
admire
in
a
stranger
but
where
we
seek
for
happiness
we
better
prize
more
homely
attributes
yet
mary
is
so
open
and
confiding
i
think
she
could
not
have
concealed
from
me
had
she
experienced
a
disappointment
douglas
was
not
aware
of
the
effect
of
her
own
practical
lessons
and
that
while
she
was
almost
unconsciously
practising
the
quiet
virtues
of
patience
and
fortitude
and
and
unostentatiously
sacrificing
her
own
wishes
to
promote
the
comfort
of
others
her
example
like
a
kindly
dew
was
shedding
its
silent
influence
on
the
embryo
blossoms
of
her
pupil
heart

jeremy

lady
juliana
had
in
vain
endeavoured
to
obtain
a
sick
certificate
for
her
daughter
that
would
have
authorised
her
consigning
her
to
the
oblivion
of
her
own
apartment
the
physicians
whom
she
consulted
all
agreed
for
once
in
recommending
a
totally
different
system
to
be
pursued
and
her
displeasure
in
consequence
was
violently
excited
against
the
medical
tribe
in
general
and
redgill
in
particular
for
that
worthy
she
had
indeed
always
entertained
a
most
thorough
contempt
and
aversion
for
he
was
poor
ugly
and
vulgar
and
these
were
the
three
most
deadly
sins
in
her
calendar
the
object
of
her
detestation
was
however
completely
insensible
to
its
effects
the
doctor
like
achilles
was
vulnerable
but
in
one
part
and
over
that
she
could
exercise
no
control
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
possessed
no
influence
over
lord
courtland
nor
authority
over

she
differed
from
himself
as
to
the
dressing
of
certain
dishes
and
in
short
he
summed
up
her
character
in
one
emphatic
sentence
that
in
his
idea
conveyed
severer
censure
than
all
that
pope
or
young
ever
wrote
i
do
think
she
has
the
taste
of
her
mouth
thus
thwarted
in
her
scheme
lady
juliana
dislike
to
her
daughter
rather
increased
than
diminished
and
it
was
well
for
mary
that
lessons
of
forbearance
had
been
early
infused
into
her
mind
for
her
spirit
was
naturally
high
and
would
have
revolted
from
the
tyranny
and
injustice
with
which
she
was
treated
had
she
not
been
taught
the
practical
duties
of
christianity
and
that
patience
with
all
its
appendages
is
the
sum
total
of
all
our
duty
that
is
proper
to
the
day
of
sorrow
not
that
mary
sought
by
a
blind
compliance
with
all
her
follies
and
caprices
to
ingratiate
herself
into
her
favour
even
the
motive
she
would
have
deemed
insufficient
to
have
sanctified
the
deed
and
the
only
arts
she
employed
to
win
a
place
in
her
parent
heart
were
ready
obedience
unvarying
sweetness
and
uncomplaining
submission
although
mary
possessed
none
of
the
sour
bigotry
of
a
narrow
mind
she
was
yet
punctual
in
the
discharge
of
her
religious
duties
and
the
sunday
following
her
arrival
as
they
sat
at
breakfast
she
inquired
of
her
cousin
at
what
time
the
church
service
began
i
really
am
not
certain
i
believe
it
is
late
replied
her
cousin
carelessly
but
why
do
you
ask
because
i
wish
to
be
there
in
proper
time
but
we
scarcely
ever
go
never
indeed
to
the
parish
church
and
we
are
rather
distant
from
any
other
so
you
must
say
your
prayers
at
home
i
would
certainly
prefer
going
to
church
said
mary
going
to
church
exclaimed
redgill
in
amazement
i
wonder
what
makes
people
so
keen
of
going
to
church
i
sure
there
little
good
to
be
got
there
for
my
part
i
declare
i
would
just
as
soon
think
of
going
into
my
grave
take
my
word
for
it
churches
and
churchyards
are
rather
too
nearly
related
in
such
a
day
as
this
said
mary
so
dry
and
sunny
i
am
sure
there
can
be
no
danger
take
your
own
way
miss
mary
said
the
doctor
but
i
think
it
my
duty
to
let
you
know
my
opinion
of
churches
i
look
upon
them
as
extremely
prejudicial
to
the
health
they
are
invariably
either
too
hot
or
too
cold
you
are
either
stewed
or
starved
in
them
and
till
some
improvement
takes
place
i
assure
you
my
foot
shall
never
enter
one
of
them
in
fact
they
are
perfect
receptacles
of
human
infirmities
i
can
tell
you
one
of
your
ladies
at
a
glance
they
have
all
rheumatisms
in
their
shoulders
and
colds
in
their
heads
and
swelled
faces
besides
it
a
poor
country
church
there
nothing
to
be
seen
after
you
do
go
i
assure
you
lady
juliana
will
be
excessively
annoyed
if
you
go
said
lady
emily
as
mary
rose
to
leave
the
room
surely
my
mother
can
not
be
displeased
at
my
attending
church
said
mary
in
astonishment
yes
she
can
and
most
certainly
will
she
never
goes
herself
now
since
she
had
a
quarrel
with
barlow
the
clergyman
and
she
bear
any
of
the
family
to
attend
him
and
you
have
my
sanction
for
staying
away
miss
mary
added
the
doctor
is
he
a
man
of
bad
character
asked
mary
as
she
stood
irresolute
whether
to
proceed
quite
the
reverse
he
is
a
very
good
man
but
he
was
scandalised
at
lady
juliana
bringing
her
dogs
to
church
one
day
and
wrote
her
what
she
conceived
a
most
insolent
letter
about
it
but
here
come
your
and
the
culprits
in
question
your
ladyship
is
just
come
in
time
to
settle
a
dispute
here
said
the
doctor
anxious
to
turn
her
attention
from
a
hot
muffin
which
had
just
been
brought
in
and
which
he
meditated
appropriating
to
himself
i
have
said
all
i
can
was
you
looking
at
the
toast
lady
emily
i
must
now
leave
it
to
your
ladyship
to
convince
this
young
lady
of
the
folly
of
going
to
church
the
doctor
gained
his
point
the
muffin
was
upon
his
own
plate
while
lady
juliana
directed
her
angry
look
towards
her
daughter
who
talks
of
going
to
church
demanded
she
mary
gently
expressed
her
wish
to
be
permitted
to
attend
divine
service
i
wo
permit
it
i
do
approve
of
girls
going
about
by
themselves
it
is
vastly
improper
and
i
wo
hear
of
it
it
is
the
only
place
i
shall
ask
to
go
to
said
mary
timidly
but
i
have
always
been
accustomed
to
attend
church
and
that
is
a
sufficient
reason
for
my
choosing
that
you
should
not
attend
it
here
i
wo
suffer
a
methodist
in
the
house
i
assure
you
the
methodists
are
gaining
ground
very
fast
said
the
doctor
with
his
mouth
full
my
soul
i
think
it
very
alarming
pray
what
is
so
alarming
in
the
apprehension
asked
lady
emily
what
is
so
alarming
my
honour
lady
emily
i
astonished
to
hear
you
ask
such
a
question
muttering
to
himself
zealots
fanatics
enthusiasts
bedlamites
i
sure
everybody
knows
what
methodists
are
there
has
been
quite
enough
said
upon
the
subject
said
lady
juliana
there
are
plenty
of
sermons
in
the
house
miss
mary
continued
the
doctor
who
like
many
other
people
thought
he
was
always
doing
a
meritorious
action
when
he
could
dissuade
anybody
from
going
to
church
i
saw
a
volume
somewhere
not
long
ago
and
at
any
rate
there
the
spectator
if
you
want
sunday
reading
some
of
the
papers
there
are
as
good
as
any
sermon
you
get
from
dr
barlow
mary
with
fear
and
hesitation
made
another
attempt
to
overcome
her
mother
prejudice
but
in
vain
i
desire
i
may
hear
no
more
about
it
cried
she
raising
her
voice
the
clergyman
is
a
most
improper
person
i
wo
suffer
any
of
my
family
to
attend
his
church
and
therefore
once
for
all
i
wo
hear
another
syllable
on
the
subject
this
was
said
in
a
tone
and
manner
not
to
be
disputed
and
mary
felt
her
resolution
give
way
before
the
displeasure
of
her
mother
a
contest
of
duties
was
new
to
her
and
she
could
not
all
at
once
resolve
upon
fulfilling
one
duty
at
the
expense
of
another
besides
thought
she
my
mother
thinks
she
is
in
the
right
perhaps
by
degrees
i
may
bring
her
to
think
otherwise
and
it
is
surely
safer
to
try
to
conciliate
than
to
determine
to
oppose
but
another
sabbath
came
and
mary
found
she
had
made
no
progress
in
obtaining
the
desired
permission
she
therefore
began
seriously
to
commune
with
her
own
heart
as
to
the
course
she
ought
to
pursue
the
commandment
of
honour
thy
father
and
thy
mother
had
been
deeply
imprinted
on
her
mind
and
few
possessed
higher
notions
of
filial
reverence
but
there
was
another
precept
which
also
came
to
her
recollection
whosoever
loveth
father
and
mother
more
than
me
can
not
be
my
disciple
but
i
may
honour
and
obey
my
parent
without
loving
her
more
than
my
saviour
argued
she
with
herself
in
hopes
of
lulling
her
conscience
by
this
reflection
but
again
thought
she
the
scripture
saith
that
keepeth
my
commandments
he
it
is
that
loveth
me
then
she
felt
the
necessity
of
owning
that
if
she
obeyed
the
commands
of
her
mother
when
in
opposition
to
the
will
of
her
god
she
gave
one
of
the
scripture
proofs
of
either
loving
or
fearing
her
parent
upon
earth
more
than
her
father
which
is
in
heaven
but
mary
eager
to
reconcile
impossibilities
viz
the
will
of
an
ungodly
parent
with
the
holy
commands
of
her
maker
thought
now
of
another
argument
to
calm
her
conscience
the
scripture
said
she
says
nothing
positive
about
attending
public
worship
and
as
lady
emily
says
i
may
say
my
prayers
just
as
well
at
home
but
the
passages
of
scripture
were
too
deeply
imprinted
on
her
mind
to
admit
of
this
subterfuge
forsake
not
the
assembling
of
yourselves
together
where
two
or
three
are
gathered
together
in
my
name
there
will
i
be
in
the
midst
of
them
etc
etc
but
alas
two
or
three
never
were
gathered
together
at
beech
park
except
upon
parties
of
pleasure
games
of
hazard
or
purposes
of
conviviality
the
result
of
mary
deliberations
was
a
firm
determination
to
do
what
she
deemed
her
duty
however
painful
and
she
went
in
search
of
lady
emily
hoping
to
prevail
upon
her
to
use
her
influence
with
lady
juliana
to
grant
the
desired
permission
or
should
she
fail
in
obtaining
it
she
trusted
her
resolution
would
continue
strong
enough
to
enable
her
have
her
mother
displeasure
in
this
act
of
conscientious
disobedience
she
met
her
cousin
with
her
bonnet
on
prepared
to
go
out
dear
lady
emily
said
she
let
me
entreat
of
you
to
use
your
influence
with
my
mother
to
persuade
her
to
allow
me
to
go
to
church
in
the
first
place
answered
her
cousin
you
may
know
that
i
have
no
influence
in
the
second
that
lady
juliana
is
never
to
be
persuaded
into
any
thing
in
the
third
i
really
ca
suppose
you
are
serious
in
thinking
it
a
matter
of
such
vast
moment
whether
or
not
you
go
to
church
indeed
i
do
answered
mary
earnestly
i
have
been
taught
to
consider
it
as
such
and
pshaw
nonsense
these
are
some
of
your
presbyterian
notions
i
shall
really
begin
to
suspect
you
are
a
methodist
and
yet
you
are
not
at
all
like
one
pray
tell
me
said
mary
with
a
smile
what
are
your
ideas
of
a
methodist
oh
thank
heaven
i
know
little
about
them
almost
as
little
as
redgill
who
i
verily
believe
could
scarcely
tell
the
difference
betwixt
a
catholic
and
a
methodist
except
that
the
one
dances
and
prays
but
i
am
rather
inclined
to
believe
it
is
a
sort
of
a
scowling
creature
with
its
greasy
hair
combed
straight
upon
its
flat
forehead
and
that
twirls
its
thumbs
and
turns
up
its
eyes
and
speaks
through
its
nose
and
in
short
is
everything
that
you
are
not
except
in
this
matter
of
going
to
church
so
to
avert
all
these
evil
signs
from
falling
upon
you
i
shall
make
a
point
of
your
keeping
company
with
me
for
the
rest
of
the
day
again
mary
became
serious
as
she
renewed
her
entreaties
to
her
cousin
to
intercede
with
lady
juliana
that
she
might
be
allowed
to
attend
church
not
for
kingdoms
exclaimed
she
her
ladyship
is
in
one
of
her
most
detestable
humours
not
that
i
should
mind
that
if
it
was
anything
of
real
consequence
that
i
had
to
compass
for
you
a
ball
for
instance
i
should
certainly
stand
by
you
there
but
i
am
really
not
so
fond
of
mischief
as
to
enrage
her
for
nothing
then
i
fear
i
must
go
to
church
without
it
said
mary
in
a
melancholy
tone
if
you
are
to
go
at
all
it
must
certainly
be
without
it
and
here
is
the
carriage
get
your
bonnet
and
come
along
with
me
you
shall
at
least
have
a
sight
of
the
church
mary
went
to
put
on
her
pelisse
and
descending
to
join
her
cousin
in
the
she
found
her
engaged
in
an
argument
with
redgill
how
it
had
commenced
did
not
appear
but
the
doctor
voice
was
raised
as
if
to
bring
it
to
a
decided
termination
the
french
madam
in
spite
of
your
prejudices
are
a
very
superior
nation
to
us
their
skill
and
knowledge
are
both
infinitely
higher
every
man
in
france
is
a
cook
in
fact
they
are
a
nation
of
cooks
and
one
of
our
late
travellers
assures
us
that
they
have
discovered
three
hundred
methods
of
dressing
eggs
for
one
thing
that
is
just
two
hundred
and
ways
more
than
enough
said
lady
emily
give
me
a
plain
boiled
egg
and
i
desire
no
other
variety
of
the
produce
of
a
hen
till
it
takes
the
form
of
a
chicken
redgill
lowered
his
eyebrows
and
drew
up
his
chin
but
disdained
to
waste
more
arguments
upon
so
tasteless
a
being
to
talk
sense
to
a
woman
is
like
feeding
chickens
upon
turtle
soup
thought
he
to
himself
as
for
lady
juliana
she
exulted
in
the
wise
and
judicious
manner
in
which
she
had
exercised
her
authority
and
felt
her
consequence
greatly
increased
by
a
public
display
of
it
power
being
an
attributes
he
was
very
seldom
invested
with
now
indeed
to
do
her
ladyship
justice
she
was
most
feelingly
alive
to
the
duty
due
to
parents
though
that
such
a
commandment
existed
seemed
quite
unknown
to
her
till
she
became
a
mother
but
she
made
ample
amends
for
former
deficiencies
now
as
to
hear
her
expatiate
on
the
subject
one
would
have
deemed
it
the
only
duty
necessary
to
be
practised
either
by
christian
or
heathen
and
that
like
charity
it
comprehended
every
virtue
and
was
a
covering
for
every
sin
but
there
are
many
more
sensible
people
than
her
ladyship
who
entertain
the
same
sentiments
and
by
way
of
variety
reverse
the
time
and
place
of
their
duties
when
they
are
children
they
make
many
judicious
reflections
on
the
duties
of
parents
when
they
become
parents
they
then
acquire
a
wonderful
insight
into
the
duties
of
children
in
the
same
manner
husbands
and
wives
are
completely
alive
to
the
duties
incumbent
upon
each
other
and
the
most
ignorant
servant
is
fully
instructed
in
the
duty
of
a
master
but
we
shall
leave
lady
juliana
to
pass
over
the
duties
of
parents
and
ponder
upon
those
of
children
while
we
follow
lady
emily
and
mary
in
their
airing
the
road
lay
by
the
side
of
a
river
and
though
mary
taste
had
been
formed
upon
the
wild
romantic
scenery
of
the
highlands
she
yet
looked
with
pleasure
on
the
tamer
beauties
of
an
english
landscape
and
though
accustomed
to
admire
even
rocks
where
the
snowflake
reposes
she
had
also
taste
though
of
a
less
enthusiastic
kind
for
the
gay
landscapes
and
gardens
of
roses
which
in
this
more
genial
clime
bloomed
even
under
winter
sway
the
carriage
drove
smoothly
along
and
the
sound
of
the
church
bell
fell
at
intervals
on
the
ear
in
cadence
sweet
now
dying
all
away
and
at
the
holy
sound
mary
heart
flew
back
to
the
peaceful
vale
and
primitive
kirk
of
lochmarlie
where
all
her
happy
sabbath
had
been
spent
the
view
now
opened
upon
the
village
church
beautifully
situated
on
the
slope
of
a
green
hill
parties
of
straggling
villagers
in
their
holiday
suits
were
descried
in
all
directions
some
already
assembled
in
the
churchyard
others
traversing
the
neat
footpaths
that
led
through
the
meadows
but
to
mary
eyes
the
english
rustic
trudging
along
the
smooth
path
was
a
far
less
picturesque
object
than
the
barefooted
highland
girl
bounding
over
trackless
hills
and
the
glossy
blue
coat
seemed
a
poor
substitute
for
the
varied
drapery
of
the
graceful
plaid
so
much
do
early
associations
tincture
all
our
future
ideas
they
had
now
reached
the
church
and
as
mary
adhered
to
her
resolution
of
attending
divine
worship
lady
emily
declared
her
intention
of
accompanying
her
that
she
might
come
in
for
her
share
of
lady
displeasure
but
in
spite
of
her
levity
the
reverend
aspect
and
meek
yet
fervent
piety
of
barlow
impressed
her
with
better
feelings
and
she
joined
in
the
service
with
outward
decorum
if
not
with
inward
devotion
the
music
consisted
of
an
organ
simply
but
well
played
and
to
mary
unaccustomed
to
any
sacred
sounds
save
those
twanged
through
the
nose
of
a
highland
it
seemed
the
music
of
the
spheres
far
different
sounds
than
those
of
peace
and
praise
awaited
her
return
lady
juliana
apprised
of
this
open
act
of
rebellion
was
in
all
the
paroxysms
incident
to
a
little
mind
on
discovering
the
impotence
of
its
power
she
rejected
all

about
ingratitude
and
disobedience
declared
her
determination
of
sending
mary
back
to
her
vulgar
scotch

one
moment
the
next
protested
she
should
never
see
those
odious

again
then
she
was
to
take
her
to

shut
her
up
in

after
uttering
all
the
incoherences
usual

ladies
in

passion
she
at
last
succeeded
in

herself
into

at
this

her
tremendous

of
passion
she
who
had
always
been
used
to
the

of

who
had
seen
her
face
sometimes
clouded
with
sorrow
but
never
deformed
by
a
spectacle
to
behold
a
parent
subject
to
the
degrading
influence
of
an
ungovernable
temper
her
very
soul
sickened
at
the
sight
and
while
she
wept
over
her
mother

she
prayed
that

mercifully
vouchsafe

still

wilder
tempests

human

shakespeare
in
addition
to
her
mother
implacable
wrath
and
unceasing
animadversion
mary
found
she
was
looked
upon
as
a
sort
of
alarming
character
by
the
whole
family
lord
courtland
seemed
afraid
of
being
drawn
into
a
religious
controversy
every
time
he
addressed
her
redgill
retreated
at
her
approach
and
eyed
her
askance
as
much
as
to
say
my
honour
a
young
lady
that
can
fly
in
her
mother
face
about
such
a
trifle
as
going
to
church
is
not
very
safe
company
and
adelaide
shunned
her
more
than
ever
as
if
afraid
of
coming
in
contact
with
a
professed
methodist
lady
emily
however
remained
staunch
to
her
and
though
she
had
her
own
private
misgivings
as
to
her
cousin
creed
she
yet
stoutly
defended
her
from
the
charge
of
methodism
and
maintained
that
in
many
respects
mary
was
no
better
than
her
neighbours
well
mary
cried
she
as
she
entered
her
room
one
day
with
an
air
of
exultation
here
is
an
opportunity
for
you
to
redeem
your
character
there
throwing
down
a
card
is
an
invitation
for
you
to
a
fancy
ball
mary
heart
bounded
at
the
mention
of
a
ball
she
had
never
been
at
one
and
it
was
pictured
in
her
imagination
in
all
the
glowing
colours
with
which
youth
and
inexperience
deck
untried
pleasures
oh
how
charming
exclaimed
she
with
sparkling
eyes
how
my
aunts
becky
and
bella
will
love
to
hear
an
account
of
a
ball
and
a
fancy
ball
what
is
that
lady
emily
explained
to
her
the
nature
of
the
entertainment
and
mary
was
in
still
greater
raptures
it
will
be
a
perfect
scene
of
enchantment
i
have
no
doubt
continued
her
cousin
for
lady
understands
giving
balls
which
is
what
every
one
does
not
for
there
are
dull
balls
as
well
as
dull
every
things
else
in
the
world
but
come
i
have
left
lady
juliana
and
adelaide
in
grand
debate
as
to
their
dresses
we
must
also
hold
a
cabinet
council
upon
ours
shall
i
summon
the
inimitable
slash
to
preside
the
mention
of
her
mother
recalled
mary
thoughts
from
the
festive
scene
to
which
they
had
already
flown
but
are
you
sure
said
she
that
i
shall
have
my
consent
to
go
quite
the
contrary
answered
her
cousin
coolly
she
wo
hear
of
your
going
but
what
signifies
that
you
could
go
to
church
in
spite
of
her
and
surely
you
ca
think
her
consent
of
much
consequence
to
a
ball
poor
mary
countenance
fell
as
the
bright
vision
of
her
imagination
melted
into
air
without
my
mother
permission
said
she
i
shall
certainly
not
think
of
or
even
wish
with
a
sigh
to
go
to
the
ball
and
if
she
has
already
refused
it
that
is
enough
lady
emily
regarded
her
with
astonishment
pray
is
it
only
on
sundays
you
make
a
point
of
disobeying
your
mother
it
is
only
when
i
conceive
a
higher
duty
is
required
of
me
answered
mary
why
i
confess
i
used
to
think
that
to
honour
one
father
and
mother
duty
till
you
showed
me
the
contrary
i
have
to
thank
you
for
ridding
me
of
that
vulgar
prejudice
and
now
after
setting
me
such
a
noble
example
of
independence
you
seem
to
have
got
a
new
light
on
the
subject
yourself
my
obedience
and
disobedience
both
proceed
from
the
same
source
answered
mary
my
first
duty
i
have
been
taught
is
to
worship
my
maker
my
next
to
obey
my
mother
my
own
gratification
never
can
come
in
competition
with
either
well
i
really
ca
enter
into
a
religious
controversy
with
you
but
it
seems
to
me
the
sin
if
it
is
one
is
precisely
the
same
whether
you
play
the
naughty
girl
in
going
to
one
place
or
another
i
can
see
no
difference
to
me
it
appears
very
different
said
mary
and
therefore
i
should
be
inexcusable
were
i
to
choose
the
evil
believing
it
to
be
such
say
what
you
will
cried
her
cousin
pettishly
you
never
will
convince
me
there
can
be
any
harm
in
disobeying
such
a
mother
as
yours
so
unreasonable
so
the
bible
makes
no
exceptions
interrupted
mary
gently
it
is
not
because
of
the
reasonableness
of
our
parents
commands
that
we
are
required
to
obey
them
but
because
it
is
the
will
of
god
you
certainly
are
a
methodist
there
no
denying
it
i
have
fought
some
hard
battles
for
you
but
i
see
i
must
give
you
up
the
thing
conceal
this
was
said
with
such
an
air
of
vexation
that
mary
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
and
yet
you
are
the
oddest
compound
continued
her
cousin
so
gay
and
comical
and
so
little
given
to
be
shocked
and
scandalised
at
the
wicked
ways
of
others
or
to
find
fault
and
lecture
or
in
short
to
do
any
of
the
insufferable
things
that
your
good
people
are
so
addicted
to
i
really
do
know
what
to
think
of
you
think
of
me
as
a
creature
with
too
many
faults
of
her
own
to
presume
to
meddle
with
those
of
others
replied
mary
smiling
at
her
perplexity
well
if
all
good
people
were
like
you
i
do
believe
i
should
become
a
saint
myself
if
you
are
right
i
must
be
wrong
but
fifty
years
hence
we
shall
settle
that
matter
with
spectacles
on
nose
over
our
family
bibles
in
the
meantime
the
business
of
the
is
much
more
pressing
we
really
must
decide
upon
something
will
you
choose
your
own
style
or
shall
i
leave
it
to
madame
trieur
to
do
us
up
exactly
alike
you
have
only
to
choose
for
yourself
my
dear
cousin
answered
mary
you
know
i
have
no
interest
in
it
at
least
not
till
i
have
received
my
mother
permission
i
have
told
you
already
there
is
no
chance
of
obtaining
it
i
had
a
with
her
on
the
subject
before
i
came
to
you
then
i
entreat
you
will
not
say
another
word
it
is
a
thing
of
so
little
consequence
that
i
am
quite
vexed
to
think
that
my
mother
should
have
been
disturbed
about
it
dear
lady
emily
if
you
love
me
promise
that
you
will
not
say
another
syllable
on
the
subject
and
this
is
all
the
thanks
i
get
for
my
trouble
and
vexation
exclaimed
lady
emily
angrily
but
the
truth
is
i
believe
you
think
it
would
be
a
sin
to
go
to
a
ball
and
as
for
dancing
oh
shocking
that
would
be
absolute
i
really
ca
say
the
bad
word
you
good
people
are
so
fond
of
using
i
understand
your
meaning
answered
mary
laughing
but
indeed
i
have
no
such
apprehensions
on
the
contrary
i
am
very
fond
of
dancing
so
fond
that
i
have
often
taken
aunt
nicky
for
my
partner
in
a
strathspey
rather
than
sit
still
and
to
confess
my
weakness
i
should
like
very
much
to
go
to
a
ball
then
you
must
and
shall
go
to
this
one
it
is
really
a
pity
that
you
should
have
enraged
lady
juliana
so
much
by
that
unfortunate
but
for
that
i
think
she
might
have
been
managed
and
even
now
i
should
not
despair
if
you
would
like
a
good
girl
beg
pardon
for
what
is
past
and
promise
never
to
do
so
any
more
impossible
replied
mary
you
surely
can
not
be
serious
in
supposing
i
would
barter
a
positive
duty
for
a
trifling
amusement
oh
hang
duties
they
are
odious
things
and
as
for
your
amiable
dutiful
virtuous
goody
characters
i
detest
them
they
never
would
go
down
with
me
even
in
the
nursery
with
all
he
attractions
of
a
gold
watch
and
coach
and
six
they
were
ever
my
abhorrence
as
every
species
of
canting
and
hypocrisy
still
is
then
struck
with
a
sense
of
her
own
violence
and
impetuosity
contrasted
with
her
cousin
meek
unreproving
manner
lady
emily
threw
her
arms
round
her
begging
pardon
and
assuring
her
she
did
not
mean
her
if
you
had
said
mary
returning
her
embrace
you
would
only
have
told
me
what
i
am
in
some
respects
dull
and
childish
i
know
i
am
for
i
am
not
the
same
creature
i
was
at
lochmarlie
and
a
tear
trembled
in
her
eye
as
she
spoke
and
troublesome
i
am
sure
you
have
found
me
no
no
eagerly
interrupted
lady
emily
you
are
the
reverse
of
all
that
you
are
the
picture
of
my
edward
and
everything
that
is
excellent
and
engaging
and
i
see
by
that
smile
you
will
go
to
the
ball
there
a
darling
mary
shook
her
head
i
tell
you
what
we
can
do
cried
her
persevering
patroness
we
can
go
as
masks
and
lady
juliana
shall
know
nothing
about
it
that
will
save
the
scandal
of
an
open
revolt
or
a
tiresome
dispute
half
the
company
will
be
masked
so
if
you
keep
your
own
secret
nobody
will
find
it
out
come
what
characters
shall
we
choose
that
of
janus
i
think
would
be
the
most
suitable
for
me
said
mary
then
in
a
serious
tone
she
added
i
can
neither
disobey
nor
deceive
my
mother
therefore
once
for
all
my
dear
cousin
let
me
entreat
of
you
to
be
silent
on
a
subject
on
which
my
mind
is
made
up
i
am
perfectly
sensible
of
your
kindness
but
any
further
discussion
will
be
very
painful
to
me
lady
emily
was
now
too
indignant
to
stoop
to
remonstrance
she
quitted
her
cousin
in
great
anger
and
poor
mary
felt
as
if
she
had
lost
her
only
friend
alas
sighed
she
how
difficult
it
is
to
do
right
when
even
the
virtues
of
others
throw
obstacles
in
our
way
and
how
easy
our
duties
would
be
could
we
kindly
aid
one
another
in
the
performance
of
them
but
such
is
human
nature
the
real
evils
of
life
of
which
we
so
loudly
complain
are
few
in
number
compared
to
the
daily
hourly
pangs
we
inflict
on
one
another
lady
emily
resentment
though
violent
was
and
in
the
certainty
that
either
the
mother
would
relent
or
the
daughter
rebel
she
ordered
a
dress
for
mary
but
the
night
of
the
ball
arrived
and
both
remained
unshaken
in
their
resolution
with
a
few
words
adelaide
might
have
obtained
the
desired
permission
for
her
sister
but
she
chose
to
remain
neuter
coldly
declaring
she
never
interfered
in
quarrels
mary
beheld
the
splendid
dresses
and
gay
countenances
of
the
party
for
the
ball
with
feelings
free
from
envy
though
perhaps
not
wholly
unmixed
with
regret
she
gazed
with
the
purest
admiration
on
the
extreme
beauty
of
her
sister
heightened
as
it
was
by
the
fantastic
elegance
of
her
dress
and
contrasted
with
her
own
pale
visage
and
mourning
habiliments
indeed
thought
she
as
she
turned
from
the
mirror
with
rather
a
mournful
smile
my
aunt
nicky
was
in
the
right
i
certainly
am
a
poor
thing
as
she
looked
again
at
her
sister
she
observed
that
her
earrings
were
not
so
handsome
as
those
she
had
received
from
macshake
and
she
instantly
brought
them
and
requested
adelaide
would
wear
them
for
that
night
adelaide
took
them
with
her
usual
coolness
remarked
how
very
magnificent
they
were
wished
some
old
woman
would
take
it
into
her
head
to
make
her
such
a
present
and
as
she
clasped
them
in
her
ears
regarded
herself
with
increased
complacency
the
hour
of
departure
arrived
lord
courtland
and
lady
juliana
were
at
length
ready
and
mary
found
herself
left
to
a
with
redgill
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
neither
in
a
sullen
nor
melancholy
mood
but
after
a
single
sigh
as
the
carriage
drove
off
she
sat
down
with
a
cheerful
countenance
to
play
backgammon
with
the
doctor
the
following
day
she
heard
of
nothing
but
the
ball
and
its
delights
for
both
her
mother
and
her
cousin
sought
though
from
different
motives
to
heighten
her
regret
at
not
having
been
there
but
mary
listened
to
the
details
of
all
she
had
missed
with
perfect
fortitude
and
only
rejoiced
to
hear
they
had
all
been
so
happy
chapter

the
clouds

again
after
the
falling
of

but

grateful
vicissitude
she
still
must
mourn
the
sun
and
moon
and
every
starry
light
eclipsed
to
her
and
lost
in
everlasting
night
prior
amongst
the
numerous
letters
and
parcels
with
which
mary
had
been
entrusted
by
the
whole
county
of
there
was
one
she
had
received
from
the
hands
of
lady
maclaughlan
with
a
strict
injunction
to
be
the
bearer
of
it
herself
and
as
even
lady
maclaughlan
wishes
now
wore
an
almost
sacred
character
in
mary
estimation
she
was
very
desirous
of
fulfilling
this
her
parting
charge
but
in
the
thraldom
in
which
she
was
kept
she
knew
not
how
that
was
to
be
accomplished
she
could
not
venture
to
wait
upon
the
lady
to
whom
it
was
addressed
without
her
mother
permission
and
she
was
aware
that
to
ask
was
upon
every
occasion
only
to
be
refused
in
his
dilemma
she
had
recourse
to
lady
emily
and
showing
her
the
letter
craved
her
advice
and
assistance
lennox
rose
hall
said
her
cousin
reading
the
superscription
oh
i
do
think
lady
juliana
will
care
a
straw
about
your
going
there
she
is
merely
an
unfortunate
blind
old
lady
whom
everybody
thinks
it
a
bore
to
visit
myself
i
afraid
amongst
the
number
we
ought
all
to
have
called
upon
her
ages
ago
so
i
shall
go
with
you
now
permission
for
mary
to
accompany
her
was
easily
obtained
for
lady
juliana
considered
a
visit
to
lennox
as
an
act
of
penance
rather
than
of
pleasure
and
adelaide
protested
the
very
mention
of
her
name
gave
her
the
vapours
there
certainly
was
nothing
that
promised
much
gratification
in
what
mary
had
heard
and
yet
she
already
felt
interested
in
this
unfortunate
blind
lady
whom
everybody
thought
it
a
bore
to
visit
and
she
sought
to
gain
some
more
information
respecting
her
but
lady
emily
though
possessed
of
warm
feelings
and
kindly
affections
was
little
given
to
frequent
the
house
of
mourning
or
sympathise
with
the
wounded
spirit
and
she
yawned
as
she
declared
she
was
very
sorry
for
poor
lennox
and
would
have
made
a
point
of
seeing
her
oftener
could
she
have
done
her
any
good
but
what
can
i
possibly
say
to
her
continued
she
after
losing
her
husband
and
having
i
do
know
how
many
sons
killed
in
battle
and
her
only
daughter
dying
of
a
consumption
and
herself
going
blind
in
consequence
of
her
grief
for
all
these
misfortunes
what
can
i
possibly
do
for
her
or
say
to
her
were
i
in
her
situation
i
sure
i
should
hate
the
sight
and
sound
of
any
human
being
and
should
give
myself
up
entirely
to
despair
that
would
be
but
a
pagan
sacrifice
said
mary
what
would
you
do
in
such
desperate
circumstances
demanded
lady
emily
i
would
hope
answered
mary
meekly
but
in
poor
lennox
case
that
would
be
to
hope
though
hope
were
lost
for
what
can
she
hope
for
now
she
has
still
something
to
fear
however
as
i
believe
she
has
still
one
son
remaining
who
is
in
the
brunt
of
every
battle
of
course
she
has
nothing
to
expect
but
accounts
of
his
death
but
she
may
hope
that
heaven
will
preserve
him
and
that
you
will
marry
him
that
would
do
excellently
well
for
he
is
as
brave
as
a
real
highlander
though
he
has
the
misfortune
to
be
only
half
a
one
his
father
general
lennox
was
a
true
scot
to
the
very
tip
of
his
tongue
and
as
proud
and
fiery
as
any
chieftain
need
be
death
certainly
was
an
improvement
in
the
family
but
there
is
rose
hall
with
its
pretty
shrubberies
and
nice
parterres
what
do
you
say
to
becoming
its
mistress
if
i
am
to
lay
snares
answered
mary
laughing
it
must
be
for
nobler
objects
than
hedgerow
elms
and
hillocks
green
oh
it
must
be
for
black
crags
and
naked
hills
your
country
really
does
vastly
well
to
rave
about
lofty
mountains
and
deep
glens
and
blue
lakes
and
roaring
rivers
are
mighty
things
but
i
suspect
cornfields
and
barnyards
are
quit
as
comfortable
neighbours
so
take
my
advice
and
marry
charles
lennox
mary
only
answered
by
singing
my
heart
in
the
highlands
my
heart
is
not
here
as
the
carriage
drew
up
this
is
the
property
of
lennox
said
lady
emily
in
answer
to
some
remark
of
her
companion
she
is
the
last
of
some
ancient
stock
and
you
see
the
family
taste
has
been
treated
with
all
due
respect
rose
hall
was
indeed
perfectly
english
it
was
a
description
of
place
of
which
there
are
none
in
scotland
for
it
wore
the
appearance
of
antiquity
without
the
too
usual
accompaniments
of
devastation
or
decay
neither
did
any
incongruities
betray
vicissitude
of
fortune
or
change
of
owner
but
the
taste
of
the
primitive
possessor
seemed
to
have
been
respected
through
ages
by
his
descendants
and
the
ponds
remained
as
round
and
the
hedges
as
square
and
the
grass
walks
as
straight
as
the
day
they
had
been
planned
the
same
respectability
was
also
apparent
in
the
interior
of
the
mansion
the
broad
heavy
oaken
staircase
shone
in
all
the
lustre
of
bees
wax
and
the
spacious
into
which
they
were
ushered
had
its
due
allowance
of
vandyke
portraits
massive
chairs
and
china
jars
standing
much
in
the
same
positions
they
had
been
placed
in
a
hundred
years
before
to
the
delicate
mind
the
unfortunate
are
always
objects
of
respect
as
the
ancients
held
sacred
those
places
which
had
been
blasted
by
lightning
so
the
feeling
heart
considers
the
afflicted
as
having
been
touched
by
the
hand
of
god
himself
such
were
the
sensations
with
which
mary
found
herself
in
the
presence
of
the
venerable
lennox
venerable
rather
through
affliction
than
age
for
sorrow
more
than
time
had
dimmed
the
beauty
of
former
days
though
enough
still
remained
to
excite
interest
and
engage
affection
in
the
mournful
yet
gentle
expression
of
her
countenance
and
the
speaking
silence
of
her
darkened
eyes
on
hearing
the
names
of
her
visitors
she
arose
and
guided
by
a
little
girl
who
had
been
sitting
at
her
feet
advanced
to
meet
them
and
welcomed
them
with
a
kindness
and
simplicity
of
manner
that
reminded
mary
of
the
home
she
had
left
and
the
maternal
tenderness
of
her
beloved
aunt
she
delivered
her
credentials
which
lennox
received
with
visible
surprise
but
laid
the
letter
aside
without
any
comments
lady
emily
began
some
apologies
for
the
length
of
time
that
had
intervened
since
her
last
visit
but
mrs
lennox
gently
interrupted
her
do
not
blame
yourself
my
dear
lady
emily
said
she
for
what
is
so
natural
at
your
age
and
do
not
suppose
i
am
so
unreasonable
as
to
expect
that
the
young
and
the
gay
should
seek
for
pleasure
in
the
company
of
an
old
blind
woman
at
your
time
of
life
i
would
not
have
courted
distress
anymore
than
you
at
every
time
of
life
said
lady
emily
i
am
sure
you
must
have
been
a
very
different
being
from
what
i
am
or
ever
shall
be
ah
you
little
know
what
changes
adversity
makes
in
the
character
said
lennox
mournfully
and
may
you
never
know
unless
it
is
for
your
good
i
doubt
much
if
i
shall
ever
be
good
on
any
terms
answered
lady
emily
in
a
half
melancholy
tone
i
do
think
i
have
the
elements
of
goodness
in
my
composition
but
here
is
my
cousin
who
is
fit
to
stand
proxy
for
all
the
virtues
lennox
involuntarily
turned
her
mild
but
sightless
eyes
towards
mary
then
heaved
a
sigh
and
shook
her
head
as
she
was
reminded
of
her
deprivation
mary
was
too
much
affected
to
speak
but
the
hand
that
was
extended
to
her
she
pressed
with
fervour
to
her
lips
while
her
eyes
overflowed
with
tears
the
language
of
sympathy
is
soon
understood
lennox
seemed
to
feel
the
tribute
of
pity
and
respect
that
flowed
from
mary
warm
heart
and
from
that
moment
they
felt
towards
each
other
that
indefinite
attraction
which
however
it
may
be
ridiculed
certainly
does
sometimes
influence
our
affections
that
is
a
picture
of
your
son
colonel
lennox
is
it
not
asked
lady
emily
i
mean
the
one
that
hangs
below
the
lady
in
the
satin
gown
with
the
bird
on
her
hand
lennox
answered
in
the
affirmative
then
added
with
a
sigh
and
when
i
look
on
that
face
i
forgot
all
i
had
lost
but
i
was
too
fond
too
proud
a
mother
look
at
it
my
dear
taking
mary
hand
and
leading
her
to
the
spot
while
her
features
brightened
with
an
expression
which
showed
maternal
vanity
was
not
yet
extinct
in
the
mourner
heart
he
was
only
eighteen
continued
she
when
that
was
done
and
many
a
hot
sun
has
burned
on
that
fair
brow
and
many
a
fearful
sight
has
met
these
sweet
eyes
since
then
and
sadly
that
face
may
be
changed
but
i
shall
never
see
it
more
indeed
said
lady
emily
affecting
to
be
gay
while
a
tear
stood
in
her
eye
it
is
a
very
dangerous
face
to
look
on
and
i
should
be
afraid
to
trust
myself
with
it
were
not
my
heart
already
pledged
as
for
my
cousin
there
there
is
no
fear
of
her
falling
a
sacrifice
to
hazel
eyes
and
chestnut
hair
her
imagination
is
all
on
the
side
of
sandy
locks
and
frosty
gray
eyes
and
i
should
doubt
if
cupid
himself
would
have
any
chance
with
her
unless
he
appeared
in
tartan
plaid
and
highland
bonnet
then
my
charles
would
have
some
said
lennox
with
a
faint
smile
for
he
has
lately
been
promoted
to
the
command
of
a
highland
regiment
indeed
said
lady
emily
that
is
very
gratifying
and
you
have
reason
to
be
proud
of
colonel
lennox
he
has
distinguished
himself
upon
every
occasion
ah
the
days
of
my
pride
are
now
past
replied
lennox
with
a
sigh
is
only
the
more
honour
the
greater
danger
and
i
am
weary
of
such
bloody
honours
see
there
pointing
to
another
part
of
the
room
where
hung
a
group
of
five
lovely
children
three
of
these
cherub
heads
were
laid
low
in
battle
the
fourth
my
louisa
died
of
a
broken
heart
for
the
loss
of
her
brothers
oh
what
can
human
power
or
earthly
honours
do
to
cheer
the
mother
who
has
wept
her
children
graves
but
there
a
power
raising
her
darkened
eyes
to
heaven
that
can
sustain
even
a
mother
heart
and
here
laying
her
hand
upon
an
open
bible
is
the
balm
he
has
graciously
vouchsafed
to
pour
into
the
wounded
spirit
my
comfort
is
not
that
my
boys
died
nobly
but
that
they
died
christians
lady
emily
and
mary
were
both
silent
from
different
causes
the
former
was
at
a
loss
what
to
say
the
latter
felt
too
much
affected
to
trust
her
voice
with
the
words
of
sympathy
that
hovered
on
her
lips
i
ought
to
beg
your
pardon
my
dears
said
lennox
after
a
pause
for
talking
in
this
serious
manner
to
you
who
can
not
be
supposed
to
enter
into
sorrows
to
which
you
are
strangers
but
you
must
excuse
me
though
my
heart
does
sometimes
run
over
oh
do
not
suppose
said
mary
making
an
effort
to
conquer
her
feelings
that
we
are
so
heartless
as
to
refuse
to
take
a
part
in
the
afflictions
of
others
surely
none
can
be
so
selfish
and
might
i
be
allowed
to
come
often
very
often
she
stopped
and
blushed
for
she
felt
that
her
feelings
were
carrying
her
farther
than
she
was
warranted
to
go
lennox
kindly
pressed
her
hand
ah
god
hath
indeed
sent
some
into
the
world
whose
province
it
is
to
refresh
the
afflicted
and
lighten
the
eyes
of
the
disconsolate
such
i
am
sure
you
would
be
to
me
for
i
feel
my
heart
revive
at
the
sound
of
your
voice
it
reminds
me
of
my
heart
darling
my
louisa
and
the
remembrance
of
her
though
sad
is
still
sweet
come
to
me
then
when
you
will
and
blessing
and
the
blessing
of
the
blind
and
desolate
will
reward
you
lady
emily
turned
away
and
it
was
not
till
they
had
been
some
time
in
the
carriage
that
mary
was
able
to
express
the
interest
this
visit
had
excited
and
her
anxious
desire
to
be
permitted
to
renew
it
it
is
really
an
extraordinary
kind
of
delight
mary
that
you
take
in
being
made
miserable
said
her
cousin
wiping
her
eyes
for
my
part
it
makes
me
quite
wretched
to
witness
suffering
that
i
ca
relieve
and
how
can
you
or
i
possibly
do
poor
lennox
any
good
we
bring
back
her
sons
no
but
we
can
bestow
our
sympathy
and
that
i
have
been
taught
is
always
a
consolation
to
the
afflicted
i
do
quite
understand
the
nature
of
that
mysterious
feeling
called
sympathy
when
i
go
to
visit
lennox
she
always
sets
me
and
i
try
to
set
her
is
that
what
you
call
sympathy
mary
smiled
and
shook
her
head
then
i
suppose
it
is
sympathy
to
blow
one
nose
and
and
read
the
bible
is
that
it
or
what
is
it
mary
declared
she
could
not
define
it
and
lady
emily
insisted
she
could
not
comprehend
it
you
will
some
day
or
other
said
mary
for
none
i
believe
have
ever
passed
through
life
without
feeling
or
at
least
requiring
its
support
and
it
is
well
perhaps
that
we
should
know
betimes
how
to
receive
as
well
as
how
to
bestow
it
i
do
see
the
necessity
at
all
i
know
i
should
hate
mortally
to
be
what
you
call
sympathised
with
indeed
it
appears
to
me
the
height
of
selfishness
in
anybody
to
like
it
if
i
am
wretched
it
would
be
no
comfort
to
me
to
make
everybody
else
wretched
and
were
i
in
lennox
place
i
would
have
more
spirit
than
to
speak
about
my
misfortunes
but
lennox
does
not
appear
to
be
what
you
call
a
spirited
creature
she
seems
all
sweetness
and
oh
sweet
enough
certainly
but
hers
is
a
sort
of
eolian
harp
that
lulls
me
to
sleep
i
tire
to
death
of
people
who
have
only
two
or
three
notes
in
their
character
mary
you
have
a
tolerable
compass
yourself
when
you
choose
though
i
do
think
you
have
science
enough
for
a
i
certainly
have
the
advantage
of
you
as
i
flatter
myself
my
mind
is
a
full
band
in
itself
my
kettledrums
and
trumpets
i
keep
for
lady
juliana
and
i
am
quite
in
the
humour
for
giving
her
a
flourish
today
i
really
require
something
of
an
exhilarating
nature
after
lennox
dead
march
an
unusual
bustle
seemed
to
pervade
beech
park
as
the
carriage
stopped
and
augured
well
for
its
mistress
intention
of
being
more
than
usually
vivacious
it
was
found
to
be
occasioned
by
the
arrival
of
her
brother
lord
lindore
servants
and
horses
with
the
interesting
intelligence
that
his
lordship
would
immediately
follow
and
lady
emily
wild
with
delight
forgot
everything
in
the
prospect
of
embracing
her
brother
how
does
it
happen
said
mary
when
her
cousin
transports
had
a
little
subsided
that
you
who
are
in
such
ecstasies
at
the
idea
of
seeing
your
brother
have
scarcely
mentioned
his
name
to
me
why
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
fear
i
was
beginning
to
forget
there
was
such
a
person
in
the
world
i
have
not
seen
him
since
i
was
ten
years
old
at
that
time
he
went
to
college
and
from
thence
to
the
continent
so
all
i
remember
of
him
is
that
he
was
very
handsome
and
very
and
all
that
have
heard
of
him
is
that
wherever
he
goes
he
is
the
of
fashion
and
the
mould
of
form
not
that
he
is
much
of
a
hamlet
i
a
notion
in
other
respects
so
pray
put
off
that
ophelia
phiz
and
do
look
as
if
you
were
of
ladies
most
deject
and
wretched
when
everybody
else
is
gay
and
happy
come
give
your
last
sigh
to
the
lennox
and
your
first
smile
to
that
is
sympathy

chapter
vii
quelle
fureur
quei
aveugle
caprice
quand
ie
dîner
est
prêt
boileau
i
hope
your
lordship
has
no
thoughts
of
waiting
dinner
for
lord
lindore
asked
redgill
with
a
face
of
alarm
as
seven
struck
and
neither
dinner
nor
lord
lindore
appeared
i
have
no
thoughts
upon
the
subject
answered
lord
courtland
as
he
turned
over
some
new
caricatures
with
as
much
as
if
it
had
been
that
enough
my
lord
but
i
suspect
marshall
in
his
officiousness
takes
the
liberty
of
thinking
for
you
and
that
we
shall
have
no
dinner
without
orders
rising
to
pull
the
bell
we
ought
undoubtedly
to
wait
for
frederick
said
lady
juliana
it
is
of
no
consequence
when
we
sit
down
to
table
a
violent
yell
from
the
sleeping
beauty
on
the
rug
sounded
like
a
summary
judgment
on
her
mistress
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
cried
her
ladyship
flying
to
the
offended
fair
one
in
all
the
transports
of
pity
and
indignation
how
can
you
redgill
presume
to
treat
my
dog
in
such
a
manner
me
treat
your
ladyship
dog
exclaimed
the
doctor
in
astonishment
pon
my
honour
i
quite
at
a
loss
i
absolutely
confounded
yes
i
saw
you
plainly
give
her
a
kick
and
me
kick
beauty
after
that
my
soul
i
should
just
as
soon
have
thought
of
kicking
my
own
grandmother
i
did
give
her
a
a
very
shove
just
with
the
point
of
my
toe
as
i
was
going
to
pull
the
bell
but
it
could
have
hurt
a
fly
i
assure
you
it
would
be
one
of
the
last
action
of
my
life
to
treat
beauty
ill
beauty
poor
beauty
affecting
to
pat
and
soothe
by
way
of
covering
his
transgression
but
neither
beauty
nor
her
mistress
were
to
be
taken
in
by
the
doctor
cajolerie
the
one
felt
and
the
other
saw
the
indignity
he
had
committed
and
his
caresses
and
protestations
were
all
in
vain
the
fact
was
the
doctor
indignation
was
so
raised
by
lady
remark
made
in
all
the
plenitude
of
a
late
luncheon
that
had
it
been
herself
instead
of
her
favourite
he
could
scarcely
have
refrained
from
this
testimony
of
his
detestation
and
contempt
but
much
as
he
despised
her
he
felt
the
necessity
of
propitiating
her
at
this
moment
when
dinner
itself
depended
upon
her
decision
for
lord
courtland
was
perfectly
neutral
lady
emily
as
not
present
and
a
servant
waited
to
receive
orders
i
really
believe
it
hunger
that
vexing
her
poor
brute
continued
he
with
an
air
of
us
feigned
sympathy
she
knows
the
dinner
hour
as
well
as
any
of
us
indeed
the
instinct
of
dogs
in
that
respect
is
wonderful
providence
has
really
ahem
indeed
it
no
joke
to
tamper
with
dogs
when
they
got
the
notion
of
dinner
in
their
heads
a
friend
of
mine
had
a
very
fine
animal
just
such
another
as
poor
beauty
there
she
had
always
been
accustomed
like
beauty
to
attend
the
family
to
dinner
at
a
particular
hour
but
one
day
by
some
accident
instead
of
sitting
down
at
five
she
was
kept
waiting
till
six
the
consequence
was
the
disappointment
operating
upon
an
empty
stomach
brought
on
an
attack
of
the
hydrophobia
and
the
poor
thing
was
obliged
to
be
shot
the
following
morning
i
think
your
lordship
said
dinner
in
a
loud
voice
to
the
servant
and
lady
juliana
though
still
sullen
did
not
dissent
for
an
hour
the
doctor
soul
was
in
a
paradise
still
more
substantial
than
a
turk
for
it
was
lapt
in
the
richest
of
soups
and
and
secure
of
their
existence
it
smiled
at
ladies
of
quality
and
deified
their
dinner
passed
away
and
supper
succeeded
and
breakfast
dinner
and
supper
revolved
and
still
no
lord
lindore
appeared
but
this
excited
no
alarm
in
the
family
it
was
lord
courtland
way
and
it
was
lady
juliana
way
and
it
was
all
their
ways
not
to
keep
to
their
appointed
time
and
they
therefore
experienced
none
of
the
vulgar
consternation
incident
to
common
minds
when
the
expected
guest
fails
to
appear
lady
emily
indeed
wondered
and
was
provoked
and
impatient
but
she
was
not
alarmed
and
mary
amused
herself
with
contrasting
in
her
own
mind
the
difference
of
her
aunts
feelings
in
similar
circumstances
dear
aunt
grizzy
would
certainly
have
been
in
tears
these
two
days
fancying
the
thousand
deaths
lord
lindore
must
have
died
and
aunt
jacky
would
have
been
inveighing
from
morning
till
night
against
the
irregularities
of
young
men
and
aunt
nicky
would
have
been
lamenting
that
the
black
cock
had
been
roasted
yesterday
or
that
there
would
be
no
fish
for
and
the
result
of
mary
comparison
was
that
her
aunts
feelings
however
troublesome
were
better
than
no
feelings
at
all
they
are
to
be
sure
something
like
brambles
thought
she
they
fasten
upon
one
in
every
possible
way
but
still
they
are
better
than
the
faded
exotics
of
fashionable
life
at
last
on
the
third
day
when
dinner
was
nearly
over
and
redgill
was
about
to
remark
for
the
third
time
i
think
it
as
well
we
wait
for
lord
lindore
the
door
opened
and
without
warning
or
bustle
lord
lindore
walked
calmly
into
the
room
lady
emily
uttering
an
exclamation
of
joy
threw
herself
into
his
arms
lord
courtland
was
roused
to
something
like
animation
as
he
cordially
shook
hands
with
his
son
lady
juliana
flew
into
raptures
at
the
beauty
of
his
italian
greyhound
adelaide
at
the
first
glance
decided
that
her
cousin
was
worthy
of
falling
in
love
with
her
mary
thought
on
the
happiness
of
the
family
reunion
and
redgill
offered
up
a
silent
thanksgiving
that
this
had
not
happened
ten
minutes
sooner
otherwise
the
woodcocks
would
have
been
as
cold
as
death
chairs
were
placed
by
the
officious
attendants
in
every
possible
direction
and
the
discarded
first
course
was
threatening
to
displace
the
third
but
lord
lindore
seemed
quite
insensible
to
all
these
attentions
he
stood
surveying
the
company
with
a
that
had
nothing
of
rudeness
in
it
but
seemed
merely
the
result
of
ease
his
eye
for
a
moment
rested
upon
adelaide
he
then
slightly
bowed
and
smiled
as
in
recognition
of
their
juvenile
acquaintance
i
really
ca
recommend
either
the
turtle
soup
or
the
venison
to
your
lordship
said
redgill
who
experienced
certain
uneasy
sensations
at
the
idea
of
beholding
them
resume
their
stations
something
resembling
those
which
macbeth
testified
at
sight
of
ghost
or
hamlet
on
contemplating
yorick
skull
after
travelling
there
is
nothing
like
a
light
dinner
allow
me
to
recommend
this
leettle
cuisse
de
poulet
en
papillote
and
here
are
some
fascinating
quite
foreign
if
there
is
any
roast
beef
or
boiled
mutton
to
be
had
pray
let
me
have
it
said
lord
lindore
waving
off
the
zealous
as
he
kept
placing
dish
after
dish
before
him
roast
beef
or
boiled
mutton
ejaculated
the
doctor
with
a
sort
of
internal
convulsion
he
is
certainly
mad
how
did
you
contrive
to
arrive
without
being
heard
by
me
frederick
asked
lady
emily
my
ears
have
been
wide
open
these
two
days
and
three
nights
watching
your
approach
i
walked
from
newberry
house
answered
he
carelessly
i
met
lord
newberry
two
days
ago
as
i
was
coming
here
and
he
persuaded
me
to
alter
my
course
and
accompany
him
home
vastly
flattering
to
your
friends
here
said
lady
emily
in
a
tone
of
pique
what
you
walked
all
the
way
from
newberry
exclaimed
the
earl
and
the
ground
covered
with
snow
how
could
you
do
so
foolish
a
thing
simply
because
as
the
children
say
i
liked
it
replied
lord
lindore
with
a
smile
that
just
of
a
piece
with
his
liking
to
eat
boiled
mutton
muttered
the
doctor
to
mary
and
yet
to
look
at
him
one
would
really
not
expect
such
gross
stupidity
there
certainly
was
nothing
in
lord
lindore
appearance
that
denoted
either
coarseness
of
taste
or
imbecility
of
mind
on
the
contrary
he
was
an
young
man
rather
slightly
formed
and
of
the
middle
size
possessing
that
ease
and
grace
in
all
his
movements
which
a
perfect
proportion
alone
can
bestow
there
was
nothing
foreign
or
either
in
his
dress
or
deportment
both
were
plain
even
to
simplicity
yet
an
almost
imperceptible
air
of
was
mingled
with
the
indifference
of
his
manner
he
spoke
little
and
seemed
rather
to
endure
than
to
be
gratified
by
attentions
his
own
were
chiefly
directed
to
his
dog
as
he
was
more
intent
on
feeding
it
than
on
answering
the
questions
that
were
put
to
him
there
never
was
anything
to
be
called
conversation
at
the
at
beech
park
and
the
general
practice
was
in
no
danger
of
being
departed
from
on
the
present
occasion
the
earl
hated
to
converse
it
was
a
bore
and
he
now
merely
exchanged
a
few
desultory
sentences
with
his
son
as
he
ate
his
olives
and
drank
his
claret
lady
juliana
indeed
spoke
even
more
than
her
usual
quantity
of
nonsense
but
nobody
listened
to
it
lady
emily
was
somewhat
perplexed
in
her
notions
about
her
brother
he
was
handsome
and
elegant
and
appeared
and
gentle
yet
something
was
wanting
to
fill
up
the
measure
of
her
expectations
and
a
latent
feeling
of
disappointment
lurked
in
her
heart
adelaide
was
indignant
that
he
had
not
instantly
paid
her
the
most
marked
attention
and
revenged
herself
by
her
silence
in
short
lord
lindore
arrival
seemed
to
have
added
little
or
nothing
to
the
general
stock
of
pleasure
and
the
effervescence
of
joy
the
rapture
of
like
some
subtle
essence
had
escaped
almost
as
soon
as
it
was
perceived
how
stupid
everybody
always
is
at
a
dinner
table
exclaimed
lady
emily
rising
abruptly
with
an
air
of
chagrin
i
believe
it
is
the
fumes
of
the
meat
that
dulls
one
senses
and
renders
them
so
detestable
i
long
to
see
you
in
the
frederick
i
a
notion
you
are
more
of
a
carpet
knight
than
a
knight
of
the
round
table
so
pray
in
a
whisper
as
she
passed

to
be
snored
asleep
by
redgill

do
you
follow

lord
lindore
was
in
no
haste
to
avail
himself
of
his
invitation
and
when
he
did
it
was
evident
his
was
a
mind
not
to
be
changed
by
place
for
he
entered
more
with
the
air
of
one
who
was
tired
of
the
company
he
had
left
than
expecting
pleasure
from
the
society
he
sought
do
come
and
entertain
us
lindore
cried
lady
emily
as
he
entered
for
we
are
all
heartily
sick
of
one
another
a
and
a
lack
of
company
are
things
hard
to
be
borne
it
is
only
the
expectancy
of
your
arrival
that
has
kept
us
alive
these
two
days
and
now
pray
do
let
us
die
away
of
the
reality
you
have
certainly
taken
a
most
effectual
method
of
sealing
my
lips
said
her
brother
with
a
smile
how
so
by
telling
me
that
i
am
expected
to
be
vastly
entertaining
since
every
word
i
utter
can
only
serve
to
dispel
the
illusion
and
prove
that
i
am
gifted
with
no
such
miraculous
power
i
do
think
it
requires
any
miraculous
power
either
to
entertain
or
be
entertained
for
my
part
i
flatter
myself
i
can
entertain
any
man
woman
or
child
in
the
kingdom
when
i
choose
and
as
for
being
entertained
that
is
still
an
easier
matter
i
seldom
meet
with
anybody
who
is
not
entertaining
either
from
their
folly
or
their
affectation
or
their
stupidity
or
their
vanity
or
in
short
something
of
the
ridiculous
that
renders
them
not
merely
supportable
but
positively
amusing
how
extremely
happy
you
must
be
said
lord
lindore
happy
no
i
do
know
that
my
feelings
precisely
amount
to
happiness
neither
for
at
the
very
time
i
most
diverted
i
sometimes
disgusted
too
and
often
provoked
my
spirit
gets
chafed
and
you
long
to
box
the
ears
of
all
your
acquaintances
said
her
brother
laughing
well
no
matter
there
is
nothing
so
enviable
as
a
facility
of
being
amused
and
even
the
excitement
of
anger
is
perhaps
preferable
to
the
stagnation
of
indifference
oh
thank
heaven
i
know
nothing
about
indifference
i
leave
that
to
adelaide
lord
lindore
turned
his
eyes
with
more
animation
than
he
had
yet
evinced
towards
his
cousin
who
sat
reading
apparently
paying
no
attention
to
what
was
going
on
he
regarded
her
for
a
considerable
time
with
an
expression
of
admiration
but
adelaide
though
she
was
conscious
of
his
gaze
calmly
pursued
her
studies
come
you
positively
must
do
something
to
signalise
yourself
i
assure
you
it
is
expected
of
you
that
you
should
be
the
soul
of
the
company
here
is
adelaide
waltzes
like
an
angel
when
she
can
get
a
partner
to
her
liking
but
i
waltz
like
a
mere
mortal
said
lord
lindore
seating
himself
at
a
table
and
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
book
and
i
am
engaged
to
play
billiards
with
my
uncle
said
adelaide
rising
with
a
blush
of
indignation
shall
we
have
some
music
then
can
you
bear
to
listen
to
our
croakings
after
the
warbling
of
your
italian
nightingales
asked
lady
emily
i
should
like
very
much
to
hear
you
sing
answered
her
brother
with
an
air
of
the
most
perfect
indifference
come
then
mary
do
you
be
the
one
to
the
chains
that
tie
the
hidden
soul
of
harmony
give
us
your
scotch
exile
pray
it
is
tolerably
appropriate
to
the
occasion
though
an
english
one
would
have
been
still
more
so
but
as
you
say
there
is
nothing
in
this
country
to
make
a
song
about
mary
would
rather
have
declined
but
she
saw
a
refusal
would
displease
her
cousin
and
she
was
not
accustomed
to
consult
her
own
inclination
in
such
frivolous
matters
she
therefore
seated
herself
at
the
harp
and
sang
the
following
verses
the
exile
the
weary
wanderer
may
roam
to
seek
for
bliss
in
change
of
scene
yet
still
the
loved
idea
of
home
and
of
the
days
he
there
has
seen
pursue
him
with
a
fond
regret
like
rays
from
suns
that
long
have
set

no

that

to
its
breast
the

some

some

rude
some

unknown
to

some

or

yes
these
his
aching

delight
these
bring
his
country
to
his
sight
ere
the
song
was
ended
lord
lindore
had
sauntered
away
to
the
singing
oh
jiove
omnipotente
and
seemingly
quite
unconscious
that
any
attentions
were
due
from
him
in
return
but
there
even
adelaide
charms
failed
to
attract
in
spite
of
the
variety
of
graceful
movements
practised
before
him
the
beauty
of
the
extended
arm
the
majestic
step
and
the
exclamations
of
the
enchanting
voice
lord
lindore
kept
his
station
by
the
fire
in
a
musing
attitude
from
which
he
was
only
roused
occasionally
by
the
caresses
of
his
dog
at
supper
it
was
still
worse
he
placed
himself
by
mary
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
only
of
scotland
well
what
do
you
think
of
lindore
demanded
lady
emily
of
her
aunt
and
cousins
as
they
were
about
to
separate
for
the
night
is
he
not
divine
perfectly
so
replied
lady
juliana
with
all
the
of
a
fool
i
assure
you
i
think
very
highly
of
him
he
is
a
vastly
charming
clever
young
beautiful
and
excessively
amiable
and
his
attention
to
his
dog
is
quite
delightful
it
is
so
uncommon
to
see
men
at
all
kind
to
their
dogs
i
assure
you
i
have
known
many
who
were
absolutely
cruel
to
them
beat
them
and
starved
them
and
did
a
thousand
shocking
things
and
pray
adelaide
what
is
your
opinion
of
my
brother
oh
i
i
have
no
doubt
he
is
extremely
amiable
replied
adelaide
with
a
gentle
yawn
as
mamma
says
his
attentions
to
his
dog
prove
it
and
you
mary
are
your
remarks
to
be
equally
judicious
and
polite
mary
in
all
the
sincerity
of
her
heart
said
she
thought
him
by
much
the
handsomest
and
most
man
she
had
ever
seen
and
there
she
stopped
yes
i
know
all
that
but
however
no
matter
i
only
wish
he
may
have
sense
enough
to
fall
in
love
with
you
mary
how
happy
i
should
be
to
see
you
lady
lindore
you
must
take
care
of
your
heart
for
i
hear
he
is
peu
and
moreover
that
he
admires
none
but
dames
as
for
adelaide
there
is
no
fear
of
her
she
will
never
cast
such
a
pearl
away
upon
one
who
is
merely
no
doubt
extremely
amiable
retorting
adelaide
ironical
tone
then
you
may
feel
equally
secure
upon
my
account
said
mary
as
i
assure
you
i
am
still
less
danger
of
losing
mine
after
the
warning
you
have
given
this
sketch
of
her
brother
character
which
lady
emily
had
thoughtlessly
given
produced
the
most
opposite
effects
on
the
minds
of
he
sisters
with
adelaide
it
increased
his
consequence
and
enhanced
his
value
it
would
be
no
vulgar
conquest
to
fix
and
reform
one
who
was
notorious
for
his
inconstancy
and
libertine
principles
and
from
that
moment
she
resolved
to
use
all
the
influence
of
her
charms
to
captivate
and
secure
the
heart
of
her
cousin
in
mary
mind
other
feelings
arose
although
she
was
not
one
of
the
outrageous
virtuous
who
storm
and
rail
at
the
very
mention
of
vice
and
deem
it
contamination
to
hold
any
intercourse
with
the
vicious
she
yet
possessed
proper
ideas
for
the
distinction
to
be
drawn
and
the
hope
of
finding
a
friend
and
brother
in
her
cousin
now
gave
way
to
the
feeling
that
in
future
she
could
only
consider
him
as
an
common
acquaintance
chapter

in

of

lady
emily
resolved
to

it
with
a
ball
and
always
prompt
in
following
up
her
plans
she
fell
to
work
immediately
with
her
visiting
list
certainly
said
she
as
she
scanned
it
over
there
never
was
any
family
so
afflicted
in
their
acquaintances
as
we
are
at
least
of
the
names
here
belong
to
the
most
insufferable
people
on
the
face
of
the
earth
the
claremonts
and
the
edgefields
and
the
bouveries
and
the
sedleys
and
a
few
more
are
very
well
but
can
anything
in
human
form
be
more
insupportable
than
the
rest
for
instance
that
wretch
lady
placid
does
her
merit
lie
only
in
her
name
then
asked
mary
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
when
i
have
given
you
a
slight
sketch
of
her
character
lady
placid
in
the
opinion
of
all
sensible
persons
in
general
and
myself
in
particular
is
a
vain
weak
conceited
vulgar
egotist
in
her
own
eyes
she
is
a
clever
elegant
amiable
woman
and
though
i
have
spared
no
pains
to
let
her
know
how
detestable
i
think
her
it
is
all
in
vain
she
remains
as
firmly
entrenched
in
her
own
good
opinion
as
folly
and
conceit
can
make
her
and
i
have
the
despair
of
seeing
all
my
buffetings
fall
blunted
to
the
ground
she
reminds
me
of
some
odious
fairy
or
genii
i
have
read
of
who
possessed
such
a
power
in
their
person
that
every
hostile
weapon
levelled
against
them
was
immediately
turned
into
some
agreeable
present
stones
became
balls
of
silk
arrows
flowers
swords
feathers
etc
even
so
it
is
with
lady
placid
the
grossest
insult
that
could
be
offered
she
would
construe
into
an
elegant
compliment
the
very
crimes
of
others
she
seems
to
consider
as
so
much
incense
offered
up
at
the
shrine
of
her
own
immaculate
virtue
i
certain
she
thinks
she
deserves
to
be
canonised
for
having
kept
out
of
doctors
commons
never
is
any
affair
of
that
sort
alluded
to
that
she
does
not
cast
such
a
triumphant
look
towards
her
husband
as
much
as
to
say
am
i
the
paragon
of
faithful
wives
and
virtuous
matrons
were
i
in
his
place
i
should
certainly
throw
a
plate
at
her
head
and
here
you
may
take
this
passing
remark
how
much
more
odious
people
are
who
have
radical
faults
than
those
who
commit
i
do
not
say
positive
crimes
but
occasional
weaknesses
even
a
noble
nature
may
fall
into
a
great
error
but
what
is
that
to
the
pride
envy
malice
and
conceit
of
a
little
mind
yes
i
would
at
any
time
rather
be
the
fallen
than
the
one
so
exult
over
the
fall
of
another
then
as
a
mother
she
is
if
possible
still
more
meritorious
a
woman
this
is
the
way
she
talks
a
woman
has
nobly
performed
her
part
to
her
country
and
for
posterity
when
she
has
brought
a
family
of
fine
healthy
children
into
the
world
ca
agree
with
you
i
reply
think
many
mothers
have
brought
children
into
the
world
who
would
have
been
much
better
out
of
it
a
mother
merit
must
depend
solely
upon
how
she
brings
up
her
children
hers
are
the
most
spoiled
brats
in
christendom
i
perfectly
agree
with
you
lady
emily
as
you
observe
it
is
not
every
mother
who
does
her
duty
by
her
children
indeed
i
may
say
to
you
it
is
not
everyone
that
will
make
the
sacrifices
for
their
family
i
have
done
but
thank
god
i
am
richly
repaid
my
children
are
everything
i
could
wish
them
to
be
everything
of
hers
as
a
matter
of
course
must
be
superior
to
every
other
person
and
even
what
she
is
obliged
to
share
in
common
with
others
acquires
some
miraculous
charm
in
operating
upon
her
thus
it
is
impossible
for
anyone
to
imagine
the
delight
she
takes
in
bathing
and
as
for
the
sun
no
mortal
can
conceive
the
effect
it
has
upon
her
if
she
was
to
have
the
plague
she
would
assure
you
it
was
owing
to
some
peculiar
virtue
in
her
blood
and
if
she
was
to
be
put
in
the
pillory
she
would
ascribe
it
entirely
to
her
great
merit
if
her
coachman
were
to
make
her
a
declaration
of
love
she
would
impute
it
to
the
boundless
influence
of
her
charms
that
every
man
who
sees
her
does
not
declare
his
passion
is
entirely
owing
to
the
severity
of
her
morals
and
the
dignity
of
her
deportment
if
she
is
amongst
the
first
invited
to
my
ball
that
will
be
my
eagerness
to
secure
her
if
the
very
last
it
will
be
a
mark
of
my
friendship
and
the
easy
footing
we
are
upon
if
not
invited
at
all
then
it
will
be
jealousy
in
short
the
united
strength
of
worlds
would
not
shake
that
woman
good
opinion
of
herself
and
the
intolerable
part
of
it
is
there
are
so
many
fools
in
this
one
that
she
actually
passes
with
the
multitude
for
being
a
charming
woman
always
the
same
always
pleased
and
contented
contented
just
as
like
contentment
as
the
light
emitted
by
putridity
resembles
the
divine
halo
but
too
much
of
her
let
her
have
a
card
however
then
comes
wiseacre
that
renowned
who
lavishes
her
advice
on
all
who
will
receive
it
without
hope
of
fee
or
reward
except
that
of
being
thought
wiser
than
anybody
else
but
like
many
more
deserving
characters
she
meets
with
nothing
but
ingratitude
in
return
and
the
wise
sentences
that
are
for
ever
hovering
around
her
pursed
up
mouth
have
only
served
to
render
her
insupportable
this
is
her
mode
of
proceeding
if
i
might
presume
to
advise
lady
emily
or
my
opinion
could
be
supposed
to
have
any
weight
or
my
experience
goes
for
anything
or
an
old
woman
now
but
i
think
i
know
something
of
the
world
or
a
friendly
hint
of
mine
would
be
of
any
service
then
when
very
desperate
it
is
averse
i
am
to
obtrude
my
advice
yet
as
i
consider
it
my
duty
i
must
for
once
or
certainly
is
no
affair
of
mine
at
the
same
time
i
must
just
observe
etc
etc
i
do
say
that
she
insists
however
upon
your
swallowing
all
the
advice
she
crams
you
with
for
provided
she
has
the
luxury
of
giving
it
it
can
make
little
difference
how
it
is
taken
because
whatever
befals
you
be
it
good
or
bad
it
is
equally
a
matter
of
exultation
to
her
thus
she
has
the
satisfaction
of
saying
poor
dabble
had
but
followed
my
advice
and
not
have
taken
these
pills
of
doolittle
she
would
have
been
alive
depend
upon
it
or
sir
thomas
speckle
had
but
taken
advantage
of
a
friendly
hint
i
threw
out
some
time
ago
about
the
purchase
of
the
drawrent
estate
he
might
have
been
a
man
worth
ten
thousand
a
year
at
this
moment
or
lady
dull
had
been
so
infatuated
as
to
neglect
the
caution
i
gave
her
about
bob
squander
her
daughter
might
have
been
married
to
nabob
gull
but
there
is
a
strange
contradiction
about
wiseacre
for
though
it
appears
that
all
her
friends
misfortunes
proceed
from
neglecting
her
advice
it
is
no
less
apparent
by
her
account
that
her
own
are
all
occasioned
by
following
the
advice
of
others
she
is
for
ever
doing
foolish
things
and
laying
the
blame
upon
her
neighbours
thus
it
not
been
for
my
friend
jobbs
there
i
never
would
have
parted
with
my
house
for
an
old
song
as
i
did
or
was
entirely
owing
to
miss
glue
obstinacy
that
i
was
robbed
of
my
diamond
necklace
or
have
to
thank
my
friend
colonel
crack
for
getting
my
carriage
smashed
to
pieces
in
short
she
has
the
most
comfortable
repository
of
stupid
friends
to
have
recourse
to
of
anybody
i
ever
knew
now
what
i
have
to
warn
you
against
mary
is
the
sin
of
ever
listening
to
any
of
her
advices
she
will
preach
to
you
about
the
pinning
of
your
gown
and
the
curling
of
your
hair
till
you
would
think
it
impossible
not
to
do
exactly
what
she
wants
you
to
do
she
will
inquire
with
the
greatest
solicitude
what
shoemaker
you
employ
and
will
shake
her
head
most
significantly
when
she
hears
it
is
any
other
than
her
own
but
if
ever
i
detect
you
paying
the
smallest
attention
to
any
of
her
recommendations
positively
i
shall
have
done
with
you
mary
laughingly
promised
to
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
all
wisdom
and
her
cousin
proceeded
then
here
follows
a
swarm
as
thick
as
idle
motes
in
sunny
ray
and
much
of
the
same
importance
methinks
in
the
scale
of
being
married
ladies
only
celebrated
for
their
good
dinners
or
their
pretty
equipages
or
their
fine
jewels
how
i
should
scorn
to
be
talked
of
as
the
appendage
to
any
soups
or
pearls
then
there
are
the
daughters
of
these
ladies
misses
who
are
mere
misses
and
nothing
more
oh
the
insipidity
of
a
mere
miss
a
soft
simpering
thing
with
pink
cheeks
and
pretty
hair
and
fashionable
clothes
eyes
for
anything
but
ears
for
anything
but
flattery
taste
for
anything
but
brains
for
anything
at
all
then
there
are
ladies
who
are
neither
married
nor
young
and
who
strive
with
all
their
might
to
talk
most
delightfully
that
the
charms
of
their
conversation
may
efface
the
marks
of
the
crows
feet
but
these
i
passen
by
and
nameless
numbers
moe
and
now
comes
the
hon
downe
wright
a
person
of
considerable
shrewdness
and
penetration
vulgar
but
unaffected
there
is
no
politeness
no
gentleness
in
her
heart
but
she
possesses
some
warmth
much
honesty
and
great
hospitality
she
has
acquired
the
character
of
being
oh
odious
thing
a
clever
woman
there
are
two
descriptions
of
clever
women
observe
the
one
is
endowed
with
corporeal
cleverness
the
other
with
mental
and
i
do
know
which
of
the
two
is
the
greater
nuisance
to
society
the
one
torments
you
with
her
management
the
other
with
her
smart
sayings
the
one
is
for
ever
rattling
her
bunch
of
keys
in
your
ears
the
other
electrifies
you
with
the
shock
of
her
wit
and
both
talk
much
and
and
are
such
egotists
that
i
rather
think
a
clever
woman
is
even
a
greater
term
of
reproach
than
a
good
creature
but
to
return
to
that
clever
woman
downe
wright
she
is
a
widow
left
with
the
management
of
an
only
son
a
commonplace
weak
young
man
no
one
i
believe
is
more
sensible
of
his
mental
deficiencies
than
his
mother
but
she
knows
that
a
man
of
fortune
is
in
the
eyes
of
the
many
a
man
of
consequence
and
she
therefore
wisely
talks
of
it
as
his
chief
characteristic
to
keep
him
in
good
company
and
get
him
well
married
is
all
her
aim
and
this
she
thinks
will
not
be
difficult
as
he
is
very
an
estate
of
ten
thousand
a
year
and
succeeds
to
some
scotch
lord
title
there
for
you
mary
she
once
had
views
of
adelaide
but
adelaide
met
the
advances
with
so
much
scorn
that
downe
wright
declared
she
was
thankful
she
had
shown
the
cloven
foot
in
time
for
that
she
never
would
have
done
for
a
wife
to
her
william
now
you
are
the
very
thing
to
suit
for
you
have
no
cloven
feet
to
show
or
at
least
you
are
not
so
as
downe
wright
you
have
not
spied
them
yet
it
seems
said
mary
with
a
smile
oh
as
to
that
if
you
had
them
i
should
defy
you
or
anyone
to
hide
them
from
me
when
i
reflect
upon
the
characters
of
most
of
my
acquaintances
i
sometimes
think
nature
has
formed
my
optics
only
to
see
disagreeables
that
must
be
a
still
more
painful
faculty
of
vision
than
even
the
said
mary
but
i
should
think
it
depended
very
much
upon
yourself
to
counteract
it
impossible
my
perceptions
are
so
peculiarly
alive
to
all
that
is
obnoxious
to
them
that
i
could
as
soon
preach
my
eyes
into
blindness
or
my
ears
into
deafness
as
put
down
my
feelings
with
chopping
logic
if
people
be
affected
and
ridiculous
why
must
i
live
in
a
state
of
warfare
with
myself
on
account
of
the
feelings
they
rouse
within
me
if
people
be
irritable
said
mary
laughing
why
must
others
sacrifice
their
feelings
to
gratify
them
because
mine
are
natural
feelings
and
theirs
are
artificial
a
very
saint
must
sicken
at
sight
of
affectation
you
allow
vulgarity
even
innate
vulgarity
is
bearable
stupidity
itself
is
pardonable
but
affectation
is
never
to
be
endured
or
forgiven
it
admits
of
palliation
at
least
answered
mary
i
dare
say
there
are
many
people
who
would
have
been
pleasing
and
natural
in
their
manners
had
not
their
parents
and
teachers
interfered
there
are
many
i
believe
who
have
not
courage
to
show
themselves
such
as
they
are
some
who
are
naturally
affected
and
many
very
many
who
have
been
taught
affectation
as
a
necessary
branch
of
education
yes
as
my
governesses
would
have
taught
me
but
thank
heaven
i
got
the
better
of
them
was
what
they
wanted
to
make
me
but
whenever
the
word
was
mentioned
i
used
to
knit
my
brows
and
frown
upon
them
in
such
a
sort
the
frown
like
now
sticks
by
me
but
no
matter
a
frowning
brow
is
better
than
a
false
heart
and
i
defy
anyone
to
say
that
i
am
fascinating
there
certainly
must
be
some
fascination
about
you
otherwise
i
should
never
have
sat
so
long
listening
to
you
said
mary
as
she
rose
from
the
table
at
which
she
had
been
assisting
to
dash
off
the
but
you
must
listen
to
me
a
little
longer
cried
her
cousin
seizing
her
hand
to
detain
her
i
have
not
got
half
through
my
detestables
yet
but
to
humour
you
i
shall
let
them
go
for
the
present
and
now
that
you
may
suppose
i
am
utterly
insensible
to
excellence
you
must
suffer
me
to
show
you
that
i
can
and
do
appreciate
worth
when
i
can
find
it
i
confess
my
talent
lies
fully
as
much
in
discovering
the
ridiculous
as
the
amiable
and
i
am
equally
ready
to
acknowledge
it
is
a
fault
and
no
mark
of
superior
wit
or
understanding
since
it
is
much
easier
to
hit
off
the
glaring
caricature
line
of
deformity
than
the
finer
and
more
exquisite
touches
of
beauty
especially
for
one
who
reads
as
he
run
are
sure
to
catch
the
eye
but
now
for
my
favourite
no
matter
for
her
name
it
would
frighten
you
if
were
you
to
hear
it
in
the
first
place
she
is
as
some
of
your
old
divines
say
religious
then
she
keeps
her
piety
in
its
proper
place
and
where
it
ought
to
be
in
her
very
soul
it
is
never
a
in
other
people
way
or
interfering
with
other
people
affairs
her
object
is
to
not
to
and
there
is
neither
hypocrisy
nor
austerity
necessary
for
that
she
is
forbearing
without
meanness
gentle
without
insipidity
sincere
without
rudeness
she
practises
all
the
virtues
herself
and
seems
quite
unconscious
that
others
do
do
the
same
she
is
if
i
may
trust
the
expression
of
her
eye
almost
as
much
alive
to
the
ridiculous
as
i
am
but
she
is
only
diverted
where
i
am
provoked
she
never
bestows
false
praise
even
upon
her
friends
but
a
simple
approval
from
her
is
of
more
value
than
the
finest
panegyric
from
another
she
never
finds
occasion
to
censure
or
condemn
the
conduct
of
anyone
however
flagrant
it
may
be
in
the
eyes
of
others
because
she
seems
to
think
virtue
is
better
expressed
by
her
own
actions
than
by
her
neighbour
vices
she
cares
not
for
admiration
but
is
anxious
to
do
good
and
give
pleasure
to
sum
up
the
whole
she
could
listen
with
patience
to
lady
placid
she
could
bear
to
be
advised
by
wiseacre
she
could
stand
the
scrutiny
of
downe
wright
and
hardest
task
of
all
throwing
her
arms
around
mary
neck
she
can
bear
with
all
my
and
impertinence
chapter
x
have
i
then
no
fears
for
thee
my
can
i
forget
thy
cares
from
helpless
years
thy
tenderness
for
me
an
eye
still
beamed
with
love
thompson
the
arrival
of
lord
lindore
brought
a
influx
of
visitors
to
beech
park
and
in
the
unceasing
round
of
amusement
that
went
on
mary
found
herself
completely
overlooked
she
therefore
gladly
took
advantage
of
her
insignificance
to
pay
frequent
visits
to
lennox
and
easily
prevailed
with
lady
juliana
to
allow
her
to
spend
a
week
there
occasionally
in
this
way
the
acquaintance
soon
ripened
into
the
warmest
affection
on
both
sides
the
day
seemed
doubly
dark
to
lennox
that
was
not
brightened
by
mary
presence
and
mary
felt
all
the
drooping
energies
of
her
heart
revive
in
the
delight
of
administering
to
the
happiness
of
another
lennox
was
one
of
those
gentle
amiable
beings
who
engage
our
affections
far
more
powerfully
than
many
possessed
of
higher
attributes
her
understanding
was
not
strong
neither
had
it
been
highly
cultivated
according
to
the
ideas
of
the
present
time
but
she
had
a
benevolence
of
heart
and
a
guileless
simplicity
of
thought
that
shamed
the
pride
of
wit
and
pomp
of
learning
bereft
of
all
external
enjoyments
and
destitute
of
great
mental
resources
it
was
retrospection
and
futurity
that
gilded
the
dark
evening
of
her
days
and
shed
their
light
on
the
dreary
realities
of
life
she
loved
to
recall
the
remembrance
of
her
children
to
tell
of
their
infant
beauties
their
growing
virtues
and
to
retrace
scenes
of
past
felicity
which
memory
loves
to
treasure
in
the
heart
oh
none
but
a
mother
can
tell
she
would
exclaim
the
bitterness
of
those
tears
which
fall
from
a
mother
eyes
all
other
sorrows
seem
natural
but
god
forgive
me
surely
it
is
not
natural
that
the
old
should
weep
for
the
young
oh
when
i
saw
myself
surrounded
by
my
children
little
did
i
think
that
death
was
so
soon
to
seal
their
eyes
sorrow
mine
and
yet
me
thinks
i
would
rather
have
suffered
all
than
have
stood
in
the
world
a
lonely
being
yes
my
children
revered
his
power
and
believed
in
his
name
and
thanks
to
his
mercy
i
feel
assured
they
are
now
angels
in
heaven
here
taking
some
papers
from
a
my
louisa
speaks
to
me
even
from
the
tomb
these
are
the
words
she
wrote
but
a
few
hours
before
her
death
read
them
to
me
for
it
is
not
every
voice
i
can
bear
to
hear
uttering
her
last
thoughts
mary
read
as
follows
for
ever
gone
for
ever
gone
oh
chilling
sound
that
tolls
the
knell
of
hope
and
joy
potent
with
torturing
pang
to
wound
but
not
in
mercy
to
destroy
for
ever
gone
what
words
of
grief
replete
with
wild
mysterious
woe
the
christian
kneels
to
seek
relief
a
saviour
died
is
not
so
for
a
brief
space
we
sojourn
here
and
life
rough
path
we
journey
thus
was
it
with
the
friend
so
dear
that
is
not
lost
but
sped
before
for
ever
gone
oh
madness
wild
dwells
in
that
drear
and
atheist
doom
but
death
of
horror
is
despoiled
when
heaven
shines
forth
beyond
the
tomb
for
ever
gone
oh
dreadful
fate
go
visit
nature
gather
thence
the
symbols
of
man
happier
state
which
speak
to
every
mortal
sense
the
leafless
spray
the
withered
flower
alike
with
man
owns
death
embrace
but
bustling
forth
in
summer
hour
prepare
anew
to
run
life
race
and
shall
it
be
that
man
alone
dies
never
more
to
rise
again
of
all
creation
highest
one
created
but
to
live
in
vain
for
ever
gone
oh
dire
despair
look
to
the
heavens
the
earth
the
sea
go
read
a
saviour
promise
there
go
heir
of
immortality
from
such
communings
as
these
the
selfish
would
have
turned
with
indifference
but
mary
generous
heart
was
ever
open
to
the
overflowings
of
the
wounded
spirit
she
had
never
been
accustomed
to
lavish
the
best
feelings
of
her
nature
on
frivolous
pursuits
or
fictitious
distresses
but
had
early
been
taught
to
consecrate
them
to
the
best
the
most
ennobling
purposes
of
humanity
even
to
the
comforting
of
the
weary
soul
the
binding
of
the
bruised
heart
yet
mary
was
no
rigid
moralist
she
loved
amusement
as
the
amusement
of
an
imperfect
existence
though
her
good
sense
and
still
better
principles
taught
her
to
reject
it
as
the
of
an
immortal
being
several
weeks
passed
away
during
which
mary
had
been
an
almost
constant
inmate
at
rose
hall
but
the
day
of
lady
emily
and
with
something
of
hope
and
expectation
fluttering
at
her
heart
she
anticipated
her
in
the
she
repaired
to
the
of
her
venerable
friend
with
even
more
than
usual
hilarity
but
upon
entering
the
apartment
her
gaiety
fled
for
she
was
struck
with
the
emotion
visible
on
the
countenance
of
lennox
her
meek
but
tearful
eyes
were
raised
to
heaven
and
her
hands
were
crossed
on
her
bosom
as
if
to
subdue
the
agitation
of
her
heart
her
faithful
attendant
stood
by
her
with
an
open
letter
in
her
hand
mary
flew
towards
her
and
as
her
light
step
and
soft
accents
met
her
ear
she
extended
her
arms
towards
her
mary
my
child
where
are
you
exclaimed
she
as
she
pressed
her
with
convulsive
eagerness
to
her
heart
my
son
my
charles
i
shall
see
him
see
him
oh
god
help
me
i
shall
never
see
him
more
and
she
wept
in
all
the
agony
of
contending
emotions
suddenly
and
powerful
excited
but
you
will
hear
him
you
will
hold
him
to
your
heart
you
will
be
conscious
that
he
is
beside
you
said
mary
yes
thank
god
i
shall
once
more
hear
the
voice
of
a
living
child
oh
how
often
do
those
voices
ring
in
my
heart
that
are
all
hushed
in
the
grave
i
am
used
to
it
now
but
to
think
of
his
returning
to
this
wilderness
when
last
he
left
it
he
had
father
brothers
sisters
and
to
find
all
gone
indeed
it
will
be
a
sad
return
said
the
old
housekeeper
as
she
wiped
her
eyes
for
the
colonel
doated
on
his
sister
and
she
on
him
and
his
brothers
too
dearly
they
all
loved
one
another
how
in
this
very
room
have
i
seen
them
chase
each
other
up
and
down
in
their
pretty
plays
with
their
papa
cap
and
sword
and
say
they
would
be
soldiers
mary
motioned
the
good
woman
to
be
silent
then
turning
to
mrs
lennox
she
sought
to
sooth
her
into
composure
and
turned
as
she
always
did
he
bright
side
of
the
picture
to
view
by
dwelling
on
the
joy
her
son
would
experience
in
seeing
her
lennox
shook
her
head
mournfully
alas
he
can
not
joy
in
seeing
me
such
as
i
am
i
have
too
long
concealed
from
him
my
dreary
doom
he
knows
not
that
these
poor
eyes
are
sealed
in
darkness
oh
he
will
seek
to
read
a
mother
fondness
there
and
he
will
find
all
cold
and
silent
but
he
will
also
find
you
resigned
even
contented
said
mary
while
her
tears
dropped
on
the
hand
she
held
to
her
lips
yes
god
knows
i
do
not
repine
at
his
will
it
is
not
for
myself
these
tears
fall
but
my
son
how
will
he
bear
to
behold
the
mother
he
so
loved
and
honoured
now
blind
bereft
and
helpless
and
the
wounds
of
her
heart
seemed
to
bleed
afresh
at
the
excitement
of
even
its
happiest
emotions
the
return
of
a
long
absent
son
mary
exerted
all
the
powers
of
her
understanding
all
the
tenderness
of
her
heart
to
dispel
the
mournful
images
that
pressed
on
the
mind
of
her
friend
but
she
found
it
was
not
so
much
her
her
that
produced
that
effect
and
to
leave
her
in
her
present
situation
seemed
impossible
in
the
agitation
of
her
spirits
she
had
wholly
forgotten
the
occasion
that
called
for
mary
absence
and
she
implored
her
to
remain
with
her
till
the
arrival
of
her
son
with
an
earnestness
that
was
irresistible
the
thoughts
of
her
cousin
displeasure
should
she
absent
herself
upon
such
an
occasion
caused
mary
to
hesitate
yet
her
feelings
would
not
allow
her
to
name
the
cause
how
unfeeling
it
would
sound
to
talk
of
balls
at
such
a
time
thought
she
what
a
painful
contrast
must
it
present
surely
lady
emily
will
not
blame
me
and
no
one
will
miss
me
and
in
the
ardour
of
her
feelings
she
promised
to
remain
yet
she
sighed
as
she
sent
off
her
excuse
and
thought
of
the
pleasures
she
had
renounced
but
the
sacrifice
made
the
regrets
were
soon
past
and
she
devoted
herself
entirely
to
soothing
the
agitated
spirits
of
her
venerable
friend
it
is
perhaps
the
simplest
and
most
obvious
truth
skilfully
administered
that
in
the
season
of
affliction
produces
the
most
salutary
effects
upon
our
mind
mary
was
certainly
no
logician
and
all
that
she
could
say
might
have
been
said
by
another
but
there
is
something
in
the
voice
and
manner
that
carries
an
irresistible
influence
along
with
it
something
that
tells
us
our
sorrows
are
felt
and
understood
not
coldly
seen
and
heard
mary
exertions
were
repaid
with
success
she
read
talked
played
and
sang
not
in
her
gayest
manner
but
in
that
subdued
strain
which
harmonised
with
the
feelings
while
it
won
upon
the
attention
and
she
had
at
length
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
object
of
her
solicitude
restored
to
her
usual
state
of
calm
confiding
acquiescence
god
bless
you
my
dear
mary
said
she
as
they
were
about
to
separate
for
the
night
he
only
can
repay
you
for
the
good
you
have
done
me
this
day
ah
thought
mary
as
she
tenderly
embraced
her
such
a
blessing
is
worth
a
dozen
balls
at
that
moment
the
sound
of
a
carriage
was
heard
and
an
unusual
bustle
took
place
below
but
scarcely
had
they
time
to
notice
it
ere
the
door
flew
open
and
lennox
found
herself
locked
in
the
arms
of
her
son
for
some
minutes
the
tide
of
feeling
was
too
strong
for
utterance
and
my
mother
my
son
were
the
only
words
that
either
could
articulate
at
length
raising
his
head
colonel
lennox
fixed
his
eyes
on
his
mother
face
with
a
gaze
of
deep
and
fearful
inquiry
but
no
returning
glance
spoke
there
with
that
mournful
vacuity
peculiar
to
the
blind
which
is
a
thousand
times
more
touching
than
all
the
varied
expression
of
the
living
orb
she
continued
to
regard
the
vacant
space
which
imagination
had
filled
with
the
image
she
sought
in
vain
to
behold
at
this
confirmation
of
his
worst
fears
a
shade
of
the
deepest
anguish
overspread
the
visage
of
her
son
he
raised
his
eyes
as
in
agony
to
heaven
then
threw
himself
on
his
mother
bosom
and
as
mary
hurried
from
the
apartment
she
heard
the
sob
which
burst
from
his
manly
heart
as
he
exclaimed
my
dear
mother
do
i
indeed
find
you
thus
chapter
xl
there
is
more
complacency
in
the
negligence
of
some
men
than
in
what
is
called
the
good
breeding
of
others
and
the
little
absences
of
the
heart
are
often
more
interesting
and
engaging
than
the
punctilious
attention
of
a
thousand
professed
sacrificers
to
the
mackenzie
powerful
emotions
are
the
certain
levellers
of
ordinary
feelings
when
mary
met
colonel
lennox
in
the
the
following
morning
he
accosted
her
not
with
the
ceremony
of
a
stranger
but
with
the
frankness
of
a
heart
careless
of
common
forms
and
spoke
of
his
mother
with
indications
of
sensibility
which
he
vainly
strove
to
repress
mary
knew
that
she
had
sought
to
conceal
her
real
situation
from
him
but
it
seemed
a
vague
suspicion
of
the
truth
had
crossed
his
mind
and
having
with
difficulty
obtained
a
short
leave
of
absence
he
had
hastened
to
have
either
his
hopes
or
fears
realised
and
now
that
i
know
the
worst
said
he
i
know
it
only
to
deplore
it
far
from
alleviating
presence
seems
rather
to
aggravate
my
poor
mother
misfortune
oh
it
is
heartrending
to
see
the
strivings
of
these
longing
eyes
to
look
upon
the
face
of
those
she
loves
ah
thought
mary
were
they
to
behold
that
face
now
how
changed
would
it
appear
as
she
contrasted
it
with
the
portrait
that
hung
immediately
over
the
head
of
the
original
the
one
in
all
the
brightness
of
youth
the
radiant
eyes
the
rounded
cheek
the
fair
open
brow
spoke
only
of
hope
and
health
and
joy
those
eyes
were
now
dimmed
by
sorrow
the
cheek
was
wasted
with
toil
the
brow
was
clouded
by
cares
yet
as
it
is
the
best
part
of
beauty
which
a
picture
can
not
express
so
there
is
something
superior
to
the
mere
charms
of
form
and
colour
and
an
air
of
feeling
of
mingled
vivacity
and
sensibility
gave
a
grandeur
to
the
form
and
an
expression
to
the
countenance
which
more
than
atoned
for
the
want
of
youth
more
brilliant
attributes
lord
bacon
at
least
so
thought
mary
but
her
comparisons
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
lennox
her
son
flew
towards
her
and
taking
her
arm
from
that
of
her
attendant
led
her
to
her
seat
and
sought
to
render
her
those
little
offices
which
her
helplessness
required
my
dear
charles
said
she
with
a
smile
as
he
tried
to
adjust
her
cushions
your
hands
have
not
been
used
to
this
work
your
arm
is
my
best
support
but
a
gentler
hand
must
smooth
my
pillow
mary
my
love
where
are
give
me
your
hand
then
placing
it
in
that
of
her
son
many
a
tear
has
this
hand
wiped
from
your
mother
eyes
mary
blushing
deeply
hastily
withdrew
it
she
felt
it
as
a
sort
of
appeal
to
colonel
lennox
feelings
and
a
sense
of
wounded
delicacy
made
her
shrink
from
being
thus
recommended
to
his
gratitude
but
colonel
lennox
seemed
too
much
absorbed
in
his
own
painful
reflections
to
attach
such
a
meaning
to
his
mother
words
and
though
they
excited
him
to
regard
mary
for
a
moment
with
peculiar
interest
yet
in
a
little
while
he
relapsed
into
the
mournful
reverie
from
which
he
had
been
roused
colonel
lennox
was
evidently
not
a
character
he
seemed
superior
to
the
mere
vulgar
aim
of
making
himself
agreeable
an
aim
which
has
much
oftener
its
source
in
vanity
than
in
benevolence
yet
the
exerted
himself
to
meet
his
mother
cheerfulness
though
as
often
as
he
looked
at
her
or
raised
his
eyes
to
the
youthful
group
that
hung
before
them
his
changing
hue
and
quivering
lip
betrayed
the
anguish
he
strove
to
hide
breakfast
ended
mary
rose
to
prepare
for
her
departure
in
spite
of
the
solicitations
of
her
friend
that
she
should
remain
till
the
following
day
surely
my
dear
mary
said
she
in
an
imploring
accent
you
will
not
refuse
to
bestow
one
day
of
happiness
upon
me
and
it
is
happiness
to
see
my
charles
and
you
together
i
little
thought
that
ever
i
should
have
been
so
blessed
ah
i
begin
to
think
god
has
yet
some
good
in
store
for
my
last
days
do
not
then
leave
me
just
when
i
am
beginning
to
taste
of
joy
and
she
clung
to
her
with
that
pathetic
look
which
mary
had
ever
found
irresistble
but
upon
this
occasion
she
steeled
her
heart
against
all
supplication
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
turned
from
the
entreaty
of
old
age
or
infirmity
and
those
only
who
have
lived
in
the
habitual
practice
of
administering
to
the
happiness
of
others
can
conceive
how
much
it
costs
the
generous
heart
to
resist
even
the
weaknesses
of
those
it
loves
but
mary
felt
she
had
already
sacrificed
too
much
to
affection
and
she
feared
the
reproaches
and
ridicule
that
awaited
her
return
to
beech
park
she
therefore
gently
though
steadily
adhered
to
her
resolution
only
softening
it
by
a
promise
of
returning
soon
what
an
angel
goes
there
exclaimed
lennox
to
her
son
as
mary
left
the
room
to
prepare
for
her
departure
ah
charles
could
i
but
hope
to
see

smiled
that
must
be
when
i
am
an
angel
myself
then
a
poor
soldier
like
me
must
be
satisfied
with
something
less
but
is
she
not
a
lovely
creature
asked
his
mother
with
some
solicitude
angels
you
know
are
always
fair
replied
colonel
lennox
laughingly
trying
to
parry
this
attack
upon
his
heart
ah
charles
that
is
not
being
serious
but
young
people
now
are
different
from
what
they
were
in
my
day
there
is
no
such
thing
as
falling
in
love
now
you
are
all
so
cautious
and
the
good
old
lady
thoughts
reverted
to
the
time
when
the
gay
and
gallant
captain
lennox
had
fallen
desperately
in
love
with
her
as
she
danced
a
minuet
in
a
blue
satin
sacque
and
bologna
hat
at
a
county
ball
you
forget
my
dear
mother
what
a
knack
i
had
in
falling
in
love
ten
years
ago
since
then
i
confess
i
have
got
rather
out
of
the
way
of
it
but
a
little
a
very
little
practice
i
am
sure
will
make
me
as
expert
as
ever
and
then
i
promise
you
shall
have
no
cause
to
complain
of
my
caution
lennox
sighed
and
shook
her
head
she
had
long
cherished
the
hope
that
if
ever
her
son
came
home
it
would
be
to
fall
in
love
with
and
marry
her
beloved
mary
and
she
had
dwelt
upon
this
favourite
scheme
till
it
had
taken
entire
possession
of
her
mind
in
the
simplicity
of
her
heart
she
also
imagined
that
it
would
greatly
help
to
accelerate
the
event
were
she
to
suggest
the
idea
to
her
son
as
she
had
no
doubt
but
that
the
object
of
her
affections
must
necessarily
become
the
idol
of
his
so
little
did
she
know
of
human
nature
that
the
very
means
she
used
to
accomplish
her
purpose
were
the
most
effectual
she
could
have
contrived
to
defeat
it
such
is
man
that
his
pride
revolts
from
all
attempts
to
influence
his
affections
the
weak
and
the
undiscerning
indeed
are
often
led
to
choose
love
by
another
eyes
but
the
lofty
and
independent
spirit
loves
to
create
for
itself
those
feelings
which
lose
half
their
charms
when
their
source
is
not
in
the
depths
of
their
own
heart
it
was
with
no
slight
mortification
that
lennox
saw
mary
depart
without
having
made
the
desired
impression
on
the
heart
of
her
son
or
what
was
still
more
to
be
feared
of
his
having
secured
himself
a
place
in
her
favour
but
again
and
again
she
made
mary
repeat
her
promise
of
returning
soon
and
spending
some
days
with
her
and
then
thought
she
things
will
all
come
right
when
they
live
together
and
see
each
other
constantly
they
can
not
possibly
avoid
loving
each
other
and
all
will
be
as
it
should
be
god
grant
i
may
live
to
see
it
and
hope
softened
the
pang
of
disappointment

mary
inexperienced
mind
expected
to
find
on
her
return
to
beech
park
some
vestige
of
the
pleasures
of
the
preceding
night
some
shadows
at
least
of
gaiety
to
show
what
happiness
she
had
sacrificed
what
delight
her
friends
had
enjoyed
but
for
the
first
time
she
beheld
the
hideous
aspect
of
departed
pleasure
drooping
evergreens
dying
lamps
dim
transparencies
and
faded
flowers
met
her
view
as
she
crossed
the
hall
while
the
public
rooms
were
covered
with
dust
from
the
chalked
floors
and
wax
from
the
droppings
of
the
candles
everything
in
short
looked
tawdry
and
forlorn
nothing
was
in
its
place
nothing
looked
as
it
used
to
do
and
she
stood
amazed
at
the
disagreeable
metamorphose
an
things
had
undergone
hearing
some
one
approach
she
turned
and
beheld
redgill
enter
so
it
only
you
miss
mary
exclaimed
he
in
a
tone
of
chagrin
i
was
in
hopes
it
was
some
of
the
my
soul
disgraceful
to
think
that
in
this
house
there
is
not
a
woman
stirring
yet
i
have
sent
five
messages
by
my
man
to
let
brown
know
that
i
have
been
waiting
for
my
breakfast
these
two
hours
but
this
confounded
ball
has
turned
everything
upside
down
you
are
come
to
a
pretty
scene
continued
he
looking
round
with
a
mixture
of
fury
and
contempt
a
very
pretty
scene
my
honour
i
blush
to
see
myself
standing
here
just
look
at
these
rags
kicking
a
festoon
of
artificial
roses
that
had
fallen
to
the
ground
can
anything
be
more
despicable
and
to
think
that
rational
creatures
in
possession
of
their
senses
should
take
pleasure
in
the
sight
of
such
trumpery
my
soul
i
i
declare
it
confounds
me
i
really
used
to
think
lady
emily
for
this
is
all
her
doing
had
some
sense
but
such
a
display
of
folly
as
this
pshaw
said
mary
it
is
not
fair
in
us
to
stand
here
analysing
the
dregs
of
gaiety
after
the
essence
is
gone
i
daresay
this
was
a
very
brilliant
scene
last
night
brilliant
scene
indeed
repeated
the
doctor
in
a
most
wrathful
accent
i
really
am
amazed
i
yes
brilliant
enough
if
you
mean
that
there
was
a
glare
of
light
enough
to
blind
the
devil
i
thought
my
eyes
would
have
been
put
out
the
short
time
i
stayed
indeed
i
do
think
this
one
has
recovered
it
yet
advancing
a
fierce
eye
almost
close
to
mary
do
you
think
it
looks
a
inflamed
miss
mary
mary
gave
it
as
her
opinion
that
it
did
well
that
all
i
got
by
this
business
but
i
never
was
consulted
about
it
i
thought
it
my
duty
however
to
give
a
hint
to
the
earl
when
the
thing
was
proposed
lord
says
i
house
is
your
own
you
have
a
right
to
do
what
you
please
with
it
burn
it
pull
it
down
make
a
purgatory
of
it
but
for
god
sake
do
give
a
ball
in
it
the
ball
was
given
and
you
see
the
consequences
a
ball
and
what
a
ball
that
a
whole
family
should
be
thrown
into
disorder
for
it
i
daresay
to
those
who
are
engaged
in
it
it
is
a
very
delightful
amusement
at
the
time
delightful
fiddlestick
my
soul
i
surprised
at
you
miss
mary
i
thought
your
staying
away
was
a
pretty
strong
proof
of
your
good
sense
but
i
hem
delightful
amusement
indeed
to
see
human
creatures
twirling
one
another
about
all
night
like
so
many
monkeys
making
perfect
mountebanks
of
themselves
really
i
look
upon
dancing
as
a
most
degrading
and
a
most
immoral
practice
my
soul
i
have
the
face
to
waltz
i
know
and
it
all
on
account
of
this
delightful
amusement
with
a
convulsive
shake
of
his
chin
that
things
are
in
this
state
myself
kept
waiting
for
my
breakfast
two
hours
and
a
half
beyond
my
natural
time
not
that
i
mind
myself
at
all
neither
here
nor
there
and
if
i
was
the
only
sufferer
i
sure
i
should
be
the
very
last
to
complain
but
i
own
it
vexes
it
distresses
me
my
honour
ca
stand
seeing
a
whole
family
going
to
destruction
the
doctor
agitation
was
so
great
that
mary
really
pitied
him
it
is
rather
hard
that
you
can
not
get
any
breakfast
since
you
had
no
enjoyment
in
the
ball
said
she
i
daresay
were
i
to
apply
to
brown
she
would
trust
me
with
her
keys
and
i
shall
be
happy
too
officiate
for
her
in
making
your
tea
thank
you
miss
mary
replied
the
doctor
coldly
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
it
is
really
a
very
polite
offer
on
your
part
but
hem
you
might
have
observed
that
i
never
take
tea
to
breakfast
i
keep
that
for
the
evening
most
people
i
know
do
the
reverse
but
they
in
the
wrong
coffee
is
too
nutritive
for
the
evening
the
french
themselves
are
in
an
error
there
that
woman
that
brown
knows
what
i
like
in
fact
she
the
only
woman
i
ever
met
with
who
could
make
coffee
coffee
that
i
thought
drinkable
she
knows
that
and
she
knows
that
i
like
it
to
a
moment
and
yet
here
the
doctor
blew
his
nose
and
mary
thought
she
perceived
a
tear
twinkle
in
his
eye
finding
she
was
incapable
of
administering
consolation
she
was
about
to
quit
the
room
when
the
doctor
recovering
himself
called
after
her
if
you
happen
to
be
going
the
way
of
brown
room
miss
mary
i
would
take
it
very
kind
if
you
could
just
contrive
to
let
her
know
what
time
of
day
it
is
and
that
i
have
not
tasted
a
mouthful
of
anything
since
last
night
at
twelve
when
i
took
a
morsel
of
supper
in
my
own
room
mary
took
advantage
of
the
deep
sigh
that
followed
to
make
her
escape
and
as
she
crossed
the
vestibule
she
descried
the
doctor
man
hurrying
along
with
a
coffee
pot
which
she
had
no
doubt
would
pour
consolation
into
his
master
soul
as
mary
was
aware
of
her
mother
dislike
to
introduce
her
into
company
she
flattered
herself
she
had
for
once
done
something
to
merit
her
approbation
by
having
absented
herself
on
this
occasion
but
mary
was
a
novice
in
the
ways
of
temper
and
had
yet
to
learn
that
to
study
to
please
and
to
succeed
are
very
different
things
lady
juliana
had
been
decidedly
averse
to
her
appearing
at
the
ball
but
she
was
equally
disposed
to
take
offence
at
her
having
stayed
away
besides
she
had
not
been
pleased
herself
and
her
glass
told
her
she
looked
jaded
and
she
was
therefore
as
her
maid
expressed
it
in
a
most
particular
bad
temper
and
mary
had
to
endure
reproaches
of
which
she
could
only
make
out
that
although
she
ought
not
to
have
been
present
she
was
much
to
blame
in
having
been
absent
lady
emily
indignation
was
in
a
different
style
there
was
a
heat
and
energy
in
her
anger
that
never
failed
to
overwhelm
her
victim
at
once
but
it
was
more
tolerable
than
the
tedious
fretful
ill
humour
of
the
other
and
after
she
had
fairly
exhausted
herself
in
invectives
and
ridicule
and
insolence
and
drawn
tears
from
her
cousin
eyes
by
the
bitterness
of
her
language
she
heartily
embraced
her
vowed
she
liked
her
better
than
anybody
in
the
world
and
that
she
was
a
fool
for
minding
anything
she
said
to
her
i
assure
you
said
she
i
was
only
tormenting
you
a
little
and
you
must
own
you
deserve
that
but
you
ca
suppose
i
meant
half
what
i
said
that
is
a
i
ca
conceive
you
guilty
of
you
see
i
am
much
more
charitable
in
my
conclusions
than
you
you
have
no
scruple
in
thinking
me
a
wretch
though
i
am
too
to
set
you
down
for
a
fool
come
brighten
up
and
i
tell
you
all
about
the
ball
how
i
hate
it
were
it
only
for
having
made
your
nose
red
but
really
the
thing
in
itself
was
detestable
job
himself
must
have
gone
mad
at
the
provocations
i
met
with
in
the
first
place
i
had
set
my
heart
upon
introducing
you
with
éclat
and
instead
of
which
you
preferred
with
lennox
or
sentiment
with
her
son
i
do
know
which
in
the
next
place
there
was
a
dinner
in
bath
that
kept
away
some
of
the
best
men
then
after
waiting
an
hour
and
a
half
for
frederick
to
begin
the
ball
with
lady
charlotte
m
i
went
myself
to
his
room
and
found
him
lounging
by
the
fire
with
a
volume
of
rousseau
in
his
hand
not
dressed
and
quite
surprised
that
i
should
think
his
presence
at
all
necessary
and
when
he
did
make
his
entré
conceive
my
feelings
at
seeing
him
single
out
lady
placid
as
his
partner
i
certainly
would
rather
have
seen
him
waltzing
with
a
hyena
i
do
believe
he
knew
or
cared
whom
he
danced
with
unless
perhaps
it
had
been
adelaide
but
she
was
engaged
and
there
certainly
is
some
sort
of
a
liaison
there
how
it
will
end
i
do
know
it
depends
upon
on
themselves
for
i
sure
the
course
of
their
love
may
run
smooth
if
they
choose
i
know
nothing
to
interrupt
it
perhaps
indeed
it
may
become
stagnate
from
that
very
circumstance
for
you
know
or
perhaps
you
do
know
is
no
spirit
under
heaven
that
works
with
such
delusion
mary
would
have
felt
rather
uneasy
at
his
intelligence
had
she
believed
it
possible
for
her
sister
to
be
in
love
but
she
had
ever
appeared
to
her
so
insensible
to
every
tender
emotion
and
generous
affection
that
she
could
not
suppose
even
love
itself
as
capable
of
making
any
impression
on
her
heart
when
however
she
saw
them
together
she
began
to
waver
in
her
opinion
adelaide
silent
and
disdainful
to
others
was
now
gay
and
enchanting
to
lord
lindore
and
looked
as
if
she
triumphed
in
the
victory
she
had
already
won
it
was
not
so
easy
to
ascertain
the
nature
of
lord
lindore
feelings
towards
his
cousin
and
time
only
developed
them

one

to

for
i
want
you
to
go
and
pay
a
funeral
visit
with
me
to
a
distant
relation
but
unhappily
a
near
neighbour
of
ours
who
has
lately
lost
her
husband
lady
juliana
and
adelaide
ought
to
go
but
they
wo
so
you
and
i
must
celebrate
as
we
best
can
the
obsequies
of
the
honourable
mr
sufton
mary
readily
assented
and
when
they
were
seated
in
the
carriage
her
cousin
began
since
i
am
going
to
put
you
in
the
way
of
a
trap
i
think
it
but
fair
to
warn
you
of
it
all
traps
are
odious
things
and
i
make
it
my
business
to
expose
them
wherever
i
find
them
i
own
it
chafes
my
spirit
to
see
even
sensible
people
taken
in
by
the
clumsy
machinery
of
such
a
woman
as
lady
matilda
sufton
so
here
she
is
in
her
true
colours
lady
matilda
is
descended
from
the
ancient
and
illustrious
family
of
altamont
to
have
a
fair
character
is
in
her
eyes
much
more
important
than
to
deserve
it
she
has
prepared
speeches
for
every
occasion
and
she
expects
they
are
all
to
be
believed
in
short
she
is
a
woman
the
world
is
her
theatre
and
from
it
she
looks
for
the
plaudits
due
to
her
virtue
for
with
her
the
reality
and
the
semblance
are
synonymous
she
has
a
grave
and
imposing
air
which
keeps
the
timid
at
a
distance
and
she
delivers
the
most
common
truths
as
if
they
were
the
most
profound
aphorisms
to
degrade
herself
is
her
greatest
fear
for
to
use
her
own
expression
there
is
nothing
so
degrading
as
associating
with
our
inferiors
that
is
our
inferiors
in
rank
and
wealth
for
with
her
all
other
gradations
are
incomprehensible
with
the
lower
orders
of
society
she
is
totally
unacquainted
she
knows
they
are
meanly
clothed
and
coarsely
fed
consequently
they
are
mean
she
is
proud
both
from
nature
and
principle
for
she
thinks
it
is
the
duty
of
every
woman
of
family
to
be
proud
and
that
humility
is
only
a
virtue
in
the
proper
pride
she
calls
it
though
i
rather
think
it
ought
to
be
pride
as
i
imagine
it
is
a
distinction
that
was
unknown
before
the
introduction
of
heraldry
the
only
true
knowledge
according
to
her
creed
is
the
knowledge
of
the
world
by
which
she
means
a
knowledge
of
the
most
courtly
etiquette
the
manners
and
habits
of
the
great
and
the
newest
fashions
in
dress
ignoramuses
might
suppose
she
entered
deeply
into
things
and
was
thoroughly
acquainted
with
human
nature
no
such
thing
the
only
wisdom
she
possesses
like
the
owl
is
the
look
of
wisdom
and
that
is
the
very
part
of
it
which
i
detest
passions
or
feelings
she
has
none
and
to
love
she
is
an
utter
stranger
when
somewhat
the
sear
and
yellow
leaf
she
married
sufton
a
silly
old
man
who
had
been
dead
to
the
world
for
many
years
but
after
having
had
him
buried
alive
in
his
own
chamber
till
his
existence
was
forgot
she
had
him
disinterred
for
the
purpose
of
giving
him
a
splendid
burial
in
good
earnest
that
done
her
duty
is
now
to
mourn
or
appear
to
mourn
for
the
approbation
of
the
world
and
now
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
for
here
is
sufton
house
now
for
the
trappings
and
the
weeds
of
woe
aware
of
her
cousin
satirical
turn
mary
was
not
disposed
to
yield
conviction
to
her
representation
but
entered
lady
with
a
mind
sufficiently
unbiassed
to
allow
her
to
form
her
own
judgment
but
a
very
slight
survey
satisfied
her
that
the
picture
was
not
overcharged
lady
matilda
sat
in
an
attitude
of
woe
a
crape
fan
and
open
lay
before
her
her
cambric
handkerchief
was
in
her
hand
her
was
upon
her
finger
and
the
tear
not
unbidden
stood
in
her
eye
on
the
same
sofa
and
side
by
side
sat
a
tall
awkward
personage
whom
she
introduced
as
her
brother
the
duke
of
altamont
his
grace
was
flanked
by
an
gentleman
who
was
slightly
named
as
general
carver
and
at
a
respectful
distance
was
seated
a
sort
of
something
betwixt
the
confide
humble
companion
who
was
incidentally
as
my
good
mrs
finch
her
ladyship
pressed
lady
emily
hand
i
did
not
expect
my
dearest
young
friend
after
the
blow
i
have
experienced
i
did
not
expect
i
should
so
soon
have
been
enabled
to
see
my
friends
but
i
have
made
a
great
exertion
had
i
consulted
my
own
feelings
indeed
but
there
is
a
duty
we
owe
to
the
world
there
is
an
example
we
are
all
bound
to
show
but
such
a
blow
here
she
had
recourse
to
her
handkerchief
such
a
blow
echoed
the
duke
such
a
blow
the
general
such
a
blow
reverberated
finch
the
most
doating
husband
i
may
say
he
lived
but
in
my
sight
such
a
man
such
a
man
said
the
duke
such
a
man
exclaimed
the
general
oh
such
a
man
sobbed
finch
as
she
complacently
dropped
a
few
tears
at
hat
moment
sacred
to
tender
remembrance
the
door
opened
and
downe
wright
was
announced
she
entered
the
room
as
if
she
had
come
to
profane
the
ashes
of
the
dead
and
insult
the
feelings
of
the
living
a
smile
was
upon
her
face
and
in
place
of
the
silent
pressure
she
shook
her
ladyship
heartily
by
the
hand
as
she
expressed
her
pleasure
at
seeing
her
look
so
well
well
replied
the
lady
that
is
wonderful
after
whatever
have
suffered
but
grief
it
seems
will
not
kill
i
never
thought
it
would
said
downe
wright
but
i
thought
your
having
been
confined
to
the
house
so
long
might
have
affected
your
looks
however
i
happy
to
see
that
is
not
the
case
as
i
recollect
ever
to
have
seen
you
so
fat
lady
matilda
tried
to
look
her
into
decency
but
in
vain
she
sighed
and
even
groaned
but
downe
wright
would
not
be
dolorous
and
was
not
to
be
taken
in
either
by
sigh
or
groan
or
there
was
nobody
her
ladyship
stood
so
much
in
awe
of
as
downe
wright
she
had
an
instinctive
knowledge
that
she
knew
her
and
she
felt
her
genius
repressed
by
her
as
julius
cresar
was
by
cassius
they
had
been
very
old
acquaintances
but
never
were
cordial
friends
though
many
worthy
people
are
very
apt
to
confound
the
two
upon
this
occasion
downe
wright
certainly
did
for
availing
herself
of
this
privilege
she
took
off
her
cloak
and
said
is
so
long
since
i
have
seen
you
my
dear
and
since
i
see
you
so
well
and
able
to
enjoy
the
society
of
your
friends
i
shall
delay
the
rest
of
my
visits
and
spend
the
morning
with
you
that
is
truly
kind
of
you
my
dear
downe
wright
returned
the
mourner
with
a
countenance
in
which
real
woe
was
now
plainly
depicted
but
i
can
not
be
so
selfish
as
to
claim
such
a
sacrifice
from
you
there
is
no
sacrifice
in
the
case
i
assure
you
my
dear
returned
downe
wright
this
is
a
most
comfortable
room
and
i
could
go
nowhere
that
i
would
meet
a
pleasanter
little
circle
looking
round
lady
matilda
thought
herself
undone
looking
well
fat
comfortable
room
pleasant
circle
rung
in
her
ears
and
caused
almost
as
great
a
whirl
in
her
brain
as
noses
lips
handkerchiefs
did
in
othello
downe
wright
always
disagreeable
was
now
perfectly
insupportable
she
had
disconcerted
all
her
plans
she
was
a
bar
to
all
her
studied
speeches
even
an
obstacle
to
all
her
sentimental
looks
yet
to
get
rid
of
her
was
impossible
in
fact
downe
wright
was
far
from
being
an
amiable
woman
she
took
a
malicious
pleasure
in
tormenting
those
she
did
not
like
and
her
skill
in
this
art
was
so
great
that
she
even
deprived
the
tormented
of
the
privilege
of
complaint
she
had
a
great
insight
into
character
and
she
might
be
said
to
read
the
very
thoughts
of
his
victims
making
a
desperate
effort
to
be
herself
again
lady
matilda
turned
to
her
two
young
visitors
with
whom
she
had
still
some
hopes
of
success
i
can
not
express
how
much
i
feel
indebted
to
the
sympathy
of
my
friends
upon
this
trying
occasion
an
occasion
indeed
that
called
for
sympathy
a
most
melancholy
occasion
said
the
duke
a
most
distressing
occasion
exclaimed
the
general
never
was
greater
occasion
moaned
finch
her
ladyship
wiped
her
eyes
and
resumed
i
feel
that
i
act
but
a
melancholy
part
in
spite
of
every
exertion
but
my
kind
friend
downe
wright
spirits
will
i
trust
support
me
she
knows
what
it
is
to
lose
again
her
voice
was
buried
in
her
handkerchief
and
again
she
recovered
and
proceeded
i
ought
to
apologise
for
being
thus
overcome
but
my
friends
i
hope
will
make
due
allowance
for
my
situation
it
can
not
be
expected
that
i
should
at
all
times
find
myself
able
for
company
not
at
all
said
the
duke
and
the
two
satellites
uttered
their
responses
you
are
able
for
a
great
deal
my
dear
said
the
provoking
downe
wright
and
i
have
no
doubt
but
with
a
very
little
exertion
you
could
behave
as
if
nothing
had
happened
your
partiality
makes
you
suppose
me
capable
of
a
great
deal
more
than
i
am
equal
to
answered
her
ladyship
with
a
real
hysteric
sob
it
is
not
everyone
who
is
blessed
with
the
spirits
of
downe
wright
what
woman
can
do
you
dare
who
dares
do
more
is
none
said
the
general
bowing
with
a
delighted
air
at
this
brilliant
application
downe
wright
charitably
allowed
it
to
pass
as
she
thought
it
might
be
construed
either
as
a
compliment
or
a
banter
visitors
flocked
in
and
the
insufferable
downe
wright
declared
to
all
that
her
ladyship
was
astonishingly
well
but
without
the
appropriate
whine
which
gives
proper
pathos
and
generally
accompanies
this
hackneyed
speech
finch
indeed
laboured
hard
the
effect
of
this
injudicious
cheerfulness
by
the
most
orthodox
sighs
shakes
of
the
head
and
confidential
whispers
in
which
wonderful
woman
prodigious
exertion
perfectly
overcome
suffer
for
this
afterwards
were
audibly
heard
by
all
present
but
even
then
downe
wright
lip
and
curled
nose
spoke
daggers
at
length
the
tormentor
recollected
an
engagement
she
had
made
elsewhere
and
took
leave
promising
to
return
if
possible
the
following
day
her
friend
in
her
own
mind
took
her
measures
accordingly
she
resolved
to
order
her
own
carriage
to
be
in
waiting
and
if
downe
wright
put
her
threat
in
execution
she
would
take
an
airing
true
she
had
not
intended
to
have
been
able
for
such
an
exertion
for
at
least
a
week
longer
but
with
the
blinds
down
she
thought
it
might
have
an
interesting
effect
the
enemy
fairly
gone
lady
matilda
seemed
to
feel
like
a
person
suddenly
relieved
from
the
nightmare
and
she
was
beginning
to
give
a
fair
specimen
of
her
scenic
powers
when
lady
emily
seeing
the
game
was
up
with
downe
wright
abruptly
rose
to
depart
this
has
been
a
trying
scene
for
you
my
sweet
young
friends
said
her
ladyship
taking
a
hand
of
each
it
has
indeed
replied
lady
emily
in
a
tone
so
significant
as
made
mary
start
i
know
it
would
youth
is
always
so
full
of
sympathy
i
own
i
have
a
preference
for
the
society
of
my
young
friends
on
that
account
my
good
finch
indeed
is
an
exception
but
worthy
downe
wright
has
been
almost
too
much
for
me
she
is
too
much
said
the
duke
she
is
a
great
deal
too
much
said
the
general
she
is
a
vast
deal
too
much
said
finch
i
own
i
have
been
rather
overcome
by
her
with
a
sigh
which
her
visitors
hastily
availed
themselves
of
to
make
their
retreat
the
duke
and
the
general
handed
lady
emily
and
mary
to
their
carriage
you
find
my
poor
sister
wonderfully
composed
said
the
former
charming
woman
lady
matilda
ejaculated
the
latter
her
feelings
do
honour
to
her
head
and
heart
mary
sprang
into
the
carriage
as
quick
as
possible
to
be
saved
the
embarrassment
of
a
reply
and
it
was
not
till
they
were
fairly
out
of
sight
that
she
ventured
to
raise
her
eyes
to
her
cousin
face
there
the
expression
of
and
disgust
were
so
strongly
depicted
that
she
could
not
longer
repress
her
risible
emotions
but
gave
way
to
a
violent
fit
of
laughter
how
exclaimed
her
companion
is
this
the
only
effect
moan
has
produced
upon
you
i
expected
your
taste
for
grief
would
have
been
highly
gratified
by
this
affecting
representation
my
appetite
you
ought
rather
to
say
replied
mary
taste
implies
some
discrimination
which
you
seem
to
deny
me
why
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
look
upon
you
as
a
sort
of
intellectual
ghoul
you
really
do
remind
me
of
the
lady
in
the
arabian
nights
whose
taste
or
appetite
which
you
will
led
her
to
scorn
everything
that
did
not
savour
of
the
churchyard
the
delicacy
of
your
comparison
is
highly
flattering
said
mary
but
i
must
be
duller
than
the
fatweed
were
i
to
give
my
sympathy
to
such
as
lady
matilda
sufton
well
i
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
for
i
assure
you
i
was
in
pain
lest
you
should
have
been
taken
in
notwithstanding
my
warning
to
say
something
join
the
soft
echo
or
heave
a
sigh
or
drop
a
tear
or
do
something
in
short
that
would
have
disgraced
you
with
me
for
ever
at
one
time
i
must
do
you
the
justice
to
own
i
thought
i
saw
you
with
difficulty
repress
a
smile
and
then
you
blushed
so
for
fear
you
had
betrayed
yourself
the
smile
i
suppose
has
gained
you
one
conquest
the
blush
another
how
happy
you
who
can
hit
the
various
tastes
so
easily
downe
wright
whispered
me
as
she
left
the
room
a
charming
intelligent
countenance
your
cousin
has
while
my
lord
duke
of
altamont
observed
as
he
handed
me
along
a
very
sweet
girl
miss
douglas
was
take
your
choice
william
downe
wright
or
duchess
of
altamont
duchess
of
altamont
to
be
sure
said
mary
and
then
such
a
man
oh
such
a
man
chapter
xiv
for
marriage
is
a
matter
of
more
worth
than
to
be
dealt
with
in
attorneyship
shakespeare
allow
me
to
introduce
to
you
ladies
that
most
high
and
puissant
princess
her
grace
the
duchess
of
altamont
marchioness
of
norwood
countess
of
penrose
baroness
of
etc
cried
lady
emily
as
she
threw
open
the
door
and
ushered
mary
into
the
presence
of
her
mother
and
sister
with
all
the
demonstrations
of
ceremony
and
respect
the
one
other
coloured
how
vastly
absurd
cried
lady
juliana
angrily
how
vastly
amusing
cried
adelaide
contemptuously
how
vastly
annoying
cried
lady
emily
to
think
that
this
little
highlander
should
bear
a
loft
the
ducal
crown
while
you
and
i
adelaide
must
sneak
about
in
shabby
straw
bonnets
throwing
down
her
own
in
pretended
indignation
then
to
think
which
is
almost
certain
of
her
viceroying
it
someday
and
you
and
i
and
all
of
us
being
presented
to
her
majesty
having
the
honour
of
her
hand
to
kiss
retreating
from
the
royal
presence
upon
our
heels
oh
ye
sylphs
and
gnomes
and
she
pretended
to
sink
down
overwhelmed
with
mortification
lady
emily
delighted
in
tormenting
her
aunt
and
cousin
and
she
saw
that
she
had
completely
succeeded
mary
was
disliked
by
her
mother
and
despised
by
her
sister
and
any
attempt
to
bring
her
forward
or
raise
her
to
a
level
with
themselves
never
failed
to
excite
the
indignation
of
both
the
consequences
were
always
felt
by
her
in
the
increased
and
disdainful
indifference
with
which
she
was
treated
and
on
the
present
occasion
her
injudicious
friend
was
only
brewing
phials
of
wrath
for
her
but
lady
emily
never
looked
to
future
consequences
present
effect
was
all
she
cared
for
and
she
went
on
to
relate
seriously
as
she
called
it
but
in
the
most
exaggerated
terms
the
admiration
which
the
duke
had
expressed
for
mary
and
her
own
firm
belief
that
she
might
be
duchess
when
she
chose
that
is
after
the
expiry
of
his
mourning
for
the
late
duchess
everyone
knows
that
he
is
desirous
of
having
a
family
and
is
determined
to
marry
the
moment
propriety
permits
he
is
now
decidedly
on
the
for
the
year
must
be
very
near
a
close
and
then
hail
duchess
of
altamont
i
must
desire
lady
emily
you
will
find
some
other
subject
for
your
wit
and
not
fill
the
girl
head
with
folly
and
nonsense
there
is
a
great
deal
too
much
of
both
already
take
care
what
you
say
of
the
future
representative
of
majesty
of
this
may
be
high
treason
yet
only
i
trust
your
grace
will
be
as
generous
as
henry
the
fifth
was
and
that
the
duchess
of
altamont
will
not
remember
the
offences
committed
against
mary
douglas
lady
juliana
to
whom
a
jest
was
an
outrage
and
raillery
incomprehensible
now
started
up
and
as
she
passionately
swept
out
of
the
room
threw
down
a
stand
of
hyacinths
which
for
the
present
put
a
stop
to
lady
emily
diversion
the
following
day
downe
wright
arrived
with
her
son
evidently
primed
for
falling
in
love
at
first
sight
he
was
a
very
handsome
young
man
gentle
and
rather
pleasing
in
his
manners
and
mary
to
whom
his
intentions
were
not
so
palpable
thought
him
by
no
means
deserving
of
the
contempt
her
cousin
had
expressed
for
him
well
cried
lady
emily
after
they
were
gone
the
plot
begins
to
thicken
lovers
begin
to
pour
in
but
all
for
mary
how
mortifying
to
you
and
me
adelaide
at
this
rate
we
shall
have
nothing
to
boast
of
in
the
way
of
disinterested
attachment
nobody
refused
nothing
renounced
edward
will
be
reckoned
a
very
good
match
for
will
be
thought
greatly
married
if
you
succeed
in
securing
lindore
lord
lindore
as
it
seems
that
wretch
placid
calls
him
adelaide
heard
all
her
cousin
taunts
in
silence
and
with
apparent
coolness
but
they
rankled
deep
in
a
heart
already
festering
with
pride
envy
and
ambition
the
thoughts
of
her
sister
and
that
sister
so
inferior
to
herself
attaining
a
more
splendid
alliance
was
not
to
be
endured
true
she
loved
lord
lindore
and
imagined
herself
beloved
in
return
but
even
that
was
not
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
craving
passions
of
a
perverted
mind
she
did
not
indeed
attach
implicit
belief
to
all
that
her
cousin
said
on
the
subject
but
she
was
provoked
and
irritated
at
the
mere
supposition
of
such
a
thing
being
possible
for
it
is
not
merely
the
jealous
whose
happiness
is
the
sport
of
trifles
light
as
air
every
evil
thought
every
unamiable
feeling
bears
about
with
it
the
bane
of
that
enjoyment
after
which
it
vainly
aspires
mary
felt
the
increasing
which
this
subject
drew
upon
her
without
being
able
to
penetrate
the
cause
of
it
but
she
saw
that
it
was
displeasing
to
her
mother
and
sister
and
that
was
sufficient
to
make
her
wish
to
put
a
stop
to
it
she
therefore
earnestly
entreated
lady
emily
to
end
the
joke
excuse
me
replied
her
ladyship
i
shall
do
no
such
thing
in
the
first
place
there
happens
to
be
no
joke
in
the
matter
i
certain
seriously
certain
or
certainly
serious
which
you
like
that
you
may
be
duchess
of
altamont
if
you
please
it
could
be
no
common
admiration
that
prompted
his
grace
to
an
original
and
spontaneous
effusion
of
it
i
have
met
with
him
before
and
never
suspected
that
he
had
an
innate
idea
in
his
head
i
certainly
never
heard
him
utter
anything
half
so
brilliant
before
it
seemed
quite
like
the
effect
of
inspiration
but
i
can
not
conceive
even
were
it
as
you
say
why
my
mother
should
be
so
displeased
about
it
she
surely
can
not
suppose
me
so
silly
as
to
be
elated
by
the
unmeaning
admiration
of
anyone
or
so
meanly
aspiring
as
to
marry
a
man
i
could
not
love
merely
because
he
is
a
duke
she
was
incapable
of
such
a
thing
herself
she
can
not
then
suspect
me
it
seems
as
impossible
to
make
you
enter
into
the
characters
of
your
mother
and
sister
as
it
would
be
to
teach
them
to
comprehend
yours
and
far
be
it
from
me
to
act
as
interpreter
betwixt
your
understandings
if
you
ca
even
imagine
such
things
as
prejudice
envy
hatred
and
malice
your
ignorance
is
bliss
and
you
had
better
remain
in
it
but
you
may
take
my
word
for
one
thing
and
that
is
that
a
much
wiser
thing
to
resist
tyranny
than
to
submit
to
it
your
patient
grizzles
make
nothing
of
it
except
in
little
books
in
real
life
they
become
perfect
saddled
with
the
whole
offences
of
the
family
such
will
you
become
unless
you
pluck
up
spirit
and
dash
out
marry
the
duke
and
drive
over
the
necks
of
all
your
relations
that
my
advice
to
you
and
you
may
rest
assured
that
when
i
follow
your
advice
it
shall
be
in
whole
not
in
part
well
situated
so
detestably
as
you
are
i
rather
think
the
best
thing
you
could
do
would
be
to
make
yourself
duchess
of
altamont
how
disdainful
you
look
come
tell
me
honestly
now
would
you
really
refuse
to
be
your
grace
with
ninety
thousand
a
year
and
remain
simple
mary
douglas
passing
rich
with
perhaps
forty
unquestionably
said
mary
what
you
really
pretend
to
say
you
would
not
marry
the
duke
of
altamont
cried
lady
emily
not
that
i
would
take
him
myself
but
as
you
and
i
though
the
best
of
friends
differ
widely
in
our
sentiments
on
most
subjects
i
should
really
like
to
know
how
it
happens
that
we
coincide
in
this
one
very
different
reasons
i
daresay
lead
to
the
same
conclusion
but
i
shall
generously
give
you
the
advantage
of
hearing
mine
first
i
shall
say
nothing
of
being
engaged
i
shall
even
banish
that
idea
from
my
thoughts
but
were
i
free
as
air
unloving
and
unloved
i
would
refuse
the
duke
of
altamont
first
because
he
is
old
no
first
because
he
is
stupid
second
because
he
is
formal
third
because
he
swallows
all
lady
matilda
flummery
fourth
because
he
is
more
than
double
my
age
fifth
because
he
is
not
handsome
and
to
sum
up
the
whole
in
the
sixth
he
wants
that
inimitable
ne
scais
which
i
consider
as
a
necessary
ingredient
in
the
matrimonial
cup
i
shall
not
in
addition
to
these
defects
dwell
upon
his
unmeaning
stare
his
formal
bow
his
little
senseless
simper
etc
etc
etc
all
these
enormities
and
many
more
of
the
same
stamp
i
shall
pass
by
as
i
have
no
doubt
they
had
their
due
effect
upon
you
as
well
as
me
but
then
i
am
not
like
you
under
the
torments
of
lady
juliana
authority
were
that
the
case
i
should
certainly
think
it
a
blessing
to
become
duchess
of
anybody
and
can
you
really
imagine
said
mary
that
for
the
sake
of
shaking
off
a
parent
authority
i
would
impose
upon
myself
chains
still
heavier
and
even
more
binding
can
you
suppose
i
would
so
far
forfeit
my
honour
and
truth
as
that
i
would
swear
to
love
honour
and
obey
where
i
could
feel
neither
love
nor
respect
and
where
cold
constrained
obedience
would
be
all
of
my
duty
i
could
hope
to
fulfil
love
exclaimed
lady
emily
can
i
credit
my
ears
love
did
you
say
i
thought
that
had
only
been
for
naughty
ones
such
as
me
and
that
saints
like
you
would
have
married
for
anything
and
everything
but
love
prudence
i
thought
had
been
the
word
with
you
proper
ladies
a
prudent
marriage
come
confess
is
not
that
the
climax
of
virtue
in
the
creed
of
your
school
i
never
learnt
the
creed
of
any
school
said
mary
nor
ever
heard
anyone
sentiments
on
the
subject
except
my
dear
mrs
douglas
well
i
should
like
to
hear
your
oracle
opinion
if
you
can
give
it
in
shorthand
she
warned
me
there
was
a
passion
which
was
very
fashionable
and
which
i
should
hear
a
great
deal
of
both
in
conversation
and
books
that
was
the
result
of
indulged
fancy
warm
imaginations
and
minds
that
many
had
fallen
into
its
snares
deceived
by
its
glowing
colours
and
alluring
name
that
a
very
good
sermon
indeed
interrupted
lady
emily
but
no
offence
to
douglas
i
think
i
could
preach
a
better
myself
love
is
a
passion
that
has
been
much
talked
of
often
described
and
little
understood
cupid
has
many
counterfeits
going
about
the
world
who
pass
very
well
with
those
whose
minds
are
capable
of
passion
but
not
of
love
these
birmingham
cupids
have
many
votaries
amongst
misses
militia
officers
and
milliners
who
marry
upon
the
mutual
faith
of
blue
eyes
and
scarlet
coats
have
dirty
houses
and
squalling
children
and
hate
each
other
most
delectably
then
there
is
another
species
for
more
refined
souls
which
owes
its
birth
to
the
works
of
rousseau
goethe
cottin
etc
its
success
depends
very
much
upon
rocks
woods
and
waterfalls
and
it
generally
ends
daggers
pistols
or
poison
but
there
i
think
lindore
would
be
more
eloquent
than
me
so
i
shall
leave
it
for
him
to
discuss
that
chapter
with
you
but
to
return
to
your
own
immediate
concerns
pray
are
you
then
positively
prohibited
from
falling
in
love
did
douglas
only
dress
up
a
scarecrow
to
frighten
you
or
had
she
the
candour
to
show
you
love
himself
in
all
his
majesty
she
told
me
said
mary
that
there
was
a
love
which
even
the
wisest
and
most
virtuous
need
not
blush
to
entertain
the
love
of
a
virtuous
object
founded
upon
esteem
and
heightened
by
similarity
of
tastes
and
sympathy
of
feelings
into
a
pure
and
devoted
attachment
unless
i
feel
all
this
i
shall
never
fancy
myself
in
love
humph
i
ca
say
much
as
to
the
similarity
of
tastes
and
sympathy
of
souls
between
the
duke
and
you
but
surely
you
might
contrive
to
feel
some
love
and
esteem
for
a
coronet
and
ninety
thousand
a
year
suppose
i
did
said
mary
with
a
smile
the
next
point
is
to
honour
and
surely
he
is
as
unlikely
to
excite
that
sentiment
as
the
other
honour
i
ca
have
a
second
sermon
upon
honour
honour
take
away
the
grief
of
a
wound
as
falstaff
says
love
is
the
only
subject
i
care
to
preach
about
though
unlike
many
young
ladies
we
can
talk
about
other
things
too
but
as
to
this
duke
certainly
rather
live
on
cheese
and
garlic
in
a
windmill
far
than
feed
on
cakes
and
have
him
talk
to
me
in
any
in
christendom
and
now
i
have
had
douglas
sentiments
upon
the
subject
i
should
like
to
hear
your
own
i
have
never
thought
much
upon
the
subject
said
mary
my
sentiments
are
therefore
all
at
but
i
shall
repeat
to
you
what
i
think
is
not
love
and
what
is
and
she
repeated
these
pretty
and
lines
careless
and
faithful
love
to
sigh
yet
feel
no
pain
to
scarce
know
why
to
sport
an
hour
with
beauty
chain
then
throw
it
idly
by
to
kneel
at
many
a
shrine
yet
lay
the
heart
on
none
to
think
all
other
charms
divine
but
those
we
just
have
won
this
is
love
such
as
kindleth
hearts
that
rove
to
keep
one
sacred
flame
through
life
unchill
unmov
to
love
in
age
the
same
that
first
in
youth
we
loved
to
feel
that
we
adore
with
such
refined
excess
that
though
the
heart
would
break
with
more
we
could
not
love
with
less
this
is
love
faithful
love
such
as
saints
might
feel
above
and
such
as
i
do
feel
and
will
always
feel
for
my
edward
said
lady
emily
but
there
is
the
and
she
flew
off
singing
to
keep
one
sacred
flame
etc
chapter
xv
some
when
they
write
to
their
friends
are
all
affection
some
are
wise
and
sententious
some
strain
their
powers
for
efforts
of
gaiety
some
write
news
and
some
write
secrets
but
to
make
a
letter
without
affection
without
wisdom
without
gaiety
without
news
and
without
a
secret
is
doubtless
the
great
epistolic
art
johnson
an
unusual
length
of
time
had
elapsed
since
mary
had
heard
from
glenfern
and
she
was
beginning
to
feel
some
anxiety
on
account
of
her
friends
there
when
her
apprehensions
were
dispelled
by
the
arrival
of
a
large
packet
containing
letters
from
douglas
and
aunt
jacky
the
former
although
the
one
that
conveyed
the
greatest
degree
of
pleasure
was
perhaps
not
the
one
that
would
be
most
acceptable
to
the
reader
indeed
it
is
generally
admitted
that
the
letters
of
single
ladies
are
infinitely
more
lively
and
entertaining
than
those
of
married
ones
a
fact
which
can
neither
be
denied
nor
accounted
for
the
following
is
a
faithful
transcript
from
the
original
letter
in
question
glenfern
castle
my
dear
mary
yours
was
with
pleasure
as
it
is
a
satisfaction
to
your
friends
to
know
that
you
are
and
doing
we
all
the
most
interest
in
your
and
also
in
your
in
other
but
i
am
to
say
they
do
not
quite
pace
with
expectations
i
must
therefore
this
opportunity
of
to
you
a
of
yours
though
a
very
great
itself
is
one
a
very
slight
of
attention
on
your
will
i
have
doubt
enable
you
to
entirely
the
is
fortunate
for
my
dear
mary
that
you
have
who
are
always
ready
to
point
your
errors
to
you
for
of
that
invaluable
viz
a
sincere
a
has
gone
out
of
the
no
wiser
in
many
than
when
they
into
it
but
that
i
flatter
will
not
be
your
as
you
can
not
be
sensible
of
the
great
my
sister
and
i
have
to
point
out
your
to
you
from
the
your
birth
the
to
which
i
particularly
present
is
the
constant
omission
of
dates
to
your
by
which
means
we
are
all
of
us
very
often
into
unpleasant
as
an
of
it
our
minister
mr
happened
to
be
here
the
very
we
received
your
last
after
it
read
he
most
inquired
the
date
of
it
and
i
tell
you
how
we
all
when
we
were
to
confess
it
had
and
since
i
am
that
subject
i
think
it
much
to
tell
you
candidly
that
i
not
think
your
of
write
by
any
improved
it
does
not
as
if
you
that
pains
upon
it
which
you
ought
to
do
for
without
i
can
assure
you
mary
you
never
do
any
well
as
our
admirable
good
lady
girnachgowl
to
say
pains
gains
and
so
it
was
upon
her
for
it
was
entirely
to
her
that
the
girnachgowl
estate
was
relieved
and
to
be
what
it
is
now
viz
a
most
valuable
and
productive
i
know
there
are
young
who
are
very
think
it
them
to
take
but
i
sincerely
trust
my
dear
mary
you
have
sense
than
to
be
so
very
next
to
a
good
distinct
of
write
and
stops
which
i
observe
you
never
the
thing
to
be
attended
to
is
your
style
we
all
think
might
greatly
by
a
on
your
joined
to
a
judicious
from
your
friends
we
are
of
opinion
that
your
are
too
short
and
also
your
expressions
are
in
dignity
are
you
sufficiently
circumstantial
in
your
even
upon
subjects
of
the
highest
indeed
upon
some
you
no
information
whatever
which
is
very
extraordinary
in
a
person
who
ought
to
be
naturally
extremely
communicative
miss
who
is
here
upon
a
to
us
at
is
perfectly
at
the
total
of
news
in
your
has
a
residing
in
the
neighbourhood
of
sends
her
regular
lists
of
the
company
there
and
also
an
of
the
most
events
that
take
indeed
had
it
not
for
patty
we
never
would
have
a
of
the
celebrated
elopement
with
john
conquest
and
indeed
i
can
not
from
you
that
we
have
heard
more
as
to
what
goes
on
in
lord
courtland
through
miss
patty
than
we
have
heard
from
you
in
short
i
plainly
tell
you
painful
you
may
it
that
not
one
of
us
is
ever
a
the
wiser
after
reading
your
than
we
before
but
i
am
to
say
this
is
not
the
serious
part
of
the
we
have
to
against
you
we
are
all
to
find
excuses
for
you
even
these
points
but
i
must
your
neglecting
to
any
answers
to
certain
inquiries
of
your
aunts
to
me
perfectly
inexcusable
of
you
must
that
i
allude
to
that
of
your
aunt
grizzy
dated
the
of
december
wherein
she
a
strong
desire
that
you
should
endeavour
to
make
yourself
of
redgill
opinion
with
to
lumbago
as
she
is
extremely
anxious
to
whether
he
the
seat
of
the
disorder
to
be
in
the
bones
or
the
sinews
and
undoubtedly
it
is
of
the
greatest
to
procure
the
of
a
sensible
english
upon
a
subject
of
such
vital
your
aunt
nicky
also
in
a
letter
the
of
december
requested
to
be
whether
lord
courtland
like
our
landholders
killed
his
own
as
miss
insinuates
in
a
to
her
aunt
that
the
there
are
suspected
of
being
of
great
on
that
but
there
you
also
a
most
unbecoming
and
i
own
i
think
mysterious
and
now
my
dear
mary
said
all
that
trust
is
necessary
to
you
to
a
sense
of
duty
i
now
communicate
to
you
a
of
intelligence
i
am
certain
will
you
the
pleasure
viz
the
prospect
there
is
of
your
soon
some
of
your
friends
from
this
in
bath
our
valuable
friend
and
sir
sampson
has
been
rather
we
think
worse
than
since
you
left
us
he
is
now
of
the
entire
use
of
one
leg
he
his
a
morbid
rheumatism
but
lady
maclaughlan
us
it
is
a
rheumatic
palsy
and
she
has
now
the
resolution
of
him
to
bath
early
in
the
ensuing
and
not
only
that
but
she
has
most
considerately
your
aunt
grizzy
to
accompany
them
of
course
she
is
to
do
with
the
greatest
we
are
therefore
all
extremely
in
getting
your
aunt
things
in
order
for
such
an
and
you
must
of
that
as
an
apology
for
none
of
the
girls
at
leisure
to
write
at
present
and
for
the
shortness
of
letter
but
be
assured
we
will
all
you
fully
by
grizzy
meantime
all
in
kind
remembrance
to
and
i
my
dear
mary
your
most
affectionate
aunt
joan
douglas
upon
over
your
letter
i
am
much
with
your
x
you
surely
be
so
ignorant
as
to
know
that
a
well
is
neither
more
nor
than
joined
together
back
to
back
of
these
senseless
crosses
you
so
fond
of
and
as
to
z
defy
any
to
distinguish
them
your
trust
you
will
to
this
and
show
that
it
from

of
proper

wilful
airs
her
aunt
that
is
a
strong
lord
lindore
marriage
to
our
adelaide
but
that
is
as
you
certainly
could
have
omitted
to
us
of
a
circumstance
so
deeply
concerns
if
so
i
must
i
shall
think
you
quite
at
the
time
it
improbable
miss
have
mentioned
a
thing
to
her
having
good
to
upon
mary
could
not
entirely
repress
her
mirth
while
she
read
this
catalogue
of
her
crimes
but
she
was
at
the
same
time
eager
to
expiate
her
offences
real
or
imaginary
in
the
sight
of
her
good
old
aunt
and
she
immediately
sat
down
to
the
construction
of
a
letter
after
the
model
prescribed
though
with
little
expectation
of
being
able
to
cope
with
the
intelligent
miss
in
the
extent
of
her
communications
her
heart
warmed
at
the
thoughts
of
seeing
again
the
dear
familiar
face
of
aunt
grizzy
and
of
hearing
the
tones
of
that
voice
which
though
sharp
and
cracked
still
sounded
sweet
in
memory
ear
such
is
the
power
that
early
associations
ever
retain
over
the
kind
and
unsophisticated
heart
but
she
was
aware
how
differently
her
mother
would
feel
on
the
subject
as
she
never
alluded
to
her
husband
family
but
with
indignation
or
contempt
and
she
therefore
resolved
to
be
silent
with
regard
to
aunt
grizzy
prospects
for
the
present
chapter
xvi
as
in
apothecaries
shops
all
sorts
of
drugs
are
permitted
to
be
so
may
all
sorts
of
books
be
in
the
library
and
as
they
out
of
vipers
and
scorpions
and
poisonous
vegetables
extract
often
wholesome
medicaments
for
the
life
of
mankind
so
out
of
whatsoever
book
good
instruction
and
examples
may
be
acquired
drummond
mary
thoughts
had
often
reverted
to
rose
hall
since
the
day
she
had
last
quitted
it
and
she
longed
to
fulfil
her
promise
to
her
venerable
friend
but
a
feeling
of
delicacy
unknown
to
herself
withheld
her
she
will
not
miss
me
while
she
has
her
son
with
her
said
she
to
herself
but
in
reality
she
dreaded
her
cousin
raillery
should
she
continue
to
visit
there
as
frequently
as
before
at
length
a
favourable
opportunity
occurred
lady
emily
with
great
exultation
told
her
the
duke
of
altamont
was
to
dine
at
beech
park
the
following
day
but
that
she
was
to
conceal
it
from
lady
juliana
and
adelaide
for
assuredly
said
she
if
they
were
apprised
of
it
they
would
send
you
up
to
the
nursery
as
a
naughty
girl
or
perhaps
down
to
the
scullery
and
make
a
cinderella
of
you
depend
upon
it
you
would
not
get
leave
to
show
your
face
in
the
do
you
really
think
so
asked
mary
i
know
it
i
know
lady
juliana
would
torment
you
till
she
had
set
you
a
crying
and
then
she
would
tell
you
you
had
made
yourself
such
a
fright
that
you
were
not
fit
to
be
seen
and
so
order
you
to
your
own
room
you
know
very
well
it
would
not
be
the
first
time
that
such
a
thing
has
happened
mary
could
not
deny
the
fact
but
sick
of
idle
altercation
she
resolved
to
say
nothing
but
walk
over
to
rose
hall
the
following
morning
and
this
she
did
leaving
a
note
for
her
cousin
apologising
for
her
flight
she
was
received
with
rapture
by
lennox
ah
my
dear
mary
said
she
as
she
tenderly
embraced
her
you
know
not
you
can
not
conceive
what
a
blank
your
absence
makes
in
my
life
when
you
open
your
eyes
in
the
morning
it
is
to
see
the
light
of
day
and
the
faces
you
love
and
all
is
brightness
around
you
but
when
i
wake
it
is
still
to
darkness
my
night
knows
no
end
is
only
when
i
listen
to
your
dear
voice
that
i
forget
i
am
blind
i
should
not
have
stayed
so
long
from
you
said
mary
but
i
knew
you
had
colonel
lennox
with
you
and
i
could
not
flatter
myself
you
would
have
even
a
thought
to
bestow
upon
me
my
charles
is
indeed
everything
that
is
kind
and
devoted
to
me
he
walks
with
me
reads
to
me
talks
to
me
sits
with
me
for
hours
and
bears
with
all
my
little
weaknesses
as
a
mother
would
with
her
sick
child
but
still
there
are
a
thousand
little
feminine
attentions
he
can
not
understand
i
would
not
that
he
did
and
then
to
have
him
always
with
me
seems
so
selfish
for
gentle
and
as
he
is
i
know
he
bears
the
spirit
of
an
eagle
within
him
and
the
tame
monotony
of
my
life
can
ill
accord
with
the
nobler
habits
of
his
yet
he
says
he
is
happy
with
me
and
i
try
to
make
myself
believe
him
indeed
said
mary
i
can
not
doubt
it
it
is
always
a
happiness
to
be
with
those
we
love
and
whom
we
know
love
us
under
any
circumstances
and
it
is
for
that
reason
i
love
so
much
to
come
to
my
dear
lennox
caressing
her
as
she
spoke
dearest
mary
who
would
not
love
you
oh
could
i
but
see
could
i
but
hope
you
must
hope
everything
you
desire
said
mary
gaily
and
little
guessing
the
nature
of
her
good
friend
hopes
i
do
nothing
but
hope
and
she
tried
to
check
a
sigh
as
she
thought
how
some
of
her
best
hopes
had
been
already
blighted
by
the
unkindness
of
those
whose
love
she
had
vainly
striven
to
win
lennox
hopes
were
already
upon
her
lips
when
the
entrance
of
her
son
fortunately
prevented
their
being
for
ever
destroyed
by
a
premature
disclosure
he
welcomed
mary
with
an
appearance
of
the
greatest
pleasure
and
looked
so
much
happier
and
more
animated
than
when
she
last
saw
him
that
she
was
struck
with
the
change
and
began
to
think
he
might
almost
stand
a
comparison
with
his
picture
you
find
me
still
here
miss
douglas
said
he
although
my
mother
gives
me
many
hints
to
be
gone
by
insinuating
what
indeed
can
not
be
doubted
how
very
ill
i
supply
your
place
but
turning
to
his
mother
you
are
not
likely
to
be
rid
of
me
for
sometime
as
i
have
just
received
an
additional
leave
of
absence
but
for
that
i
must
have
left
you
tomorrow
dear
charles
you
never
told
me
so
how
could
you
conceal
it
from
me
how
wretched
i
should
have
been
had
i
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
that
is
the
very
reason
for
which
i
concealed
it
and
yet
you
reproach
me
had
i
told
you
there
was
a
chance
of
my
going
you
would
assuredly
have
set
it
down
for
a
certainty
and
so
have
been
vexed
for
no
purpose
but
your
remaining
was
a
chance
too
said
lennox
who
could
not
all
at
once
reconcile
herself
even
to
an
from
danger
and
think
had
you
been
called
away
from
me
without
any
preparation
indeed
charles
it
was
very
imprudent
my
dearest
mother
i
meant
it
in
kindness
i
could
not
bear
to
give
you
a
moment
certain
uneasiness
for
an
uncertain
evil
i
really
can
not
discover
either
the
use
or
the
virtue
of
tormenting
one
self
by
anticipation
i
should
think
it
quite
as
rational
to
case
myself
in
a
suit
of
mail
by
way
of
security
to
my
person
as
to
keep
my
mind
perpetually
on
the
rack
of
anticipating
evil
i
perfectly
agree
with
that
philosopher
who
says
if
we
confine
ourselves
to
general
reflections
on
the
evils
of
life
can
have
no
effect
in
preparing
us
for
them
and
if
we
bring
them
home
to
us
is
the
certain
means
of
rendering
ourselves
miserable
but
they
will
come
charles
said
his
mother
mournfully
whether
we
bring
them
or
not
true
my
dear
mother
but
when
misfortune
does
come
it
comes
commissioned
from
a
higher
power
and
it
will
ever
find
a
mind
ready
to
receive
it
with
reverence
and
submit
to
it
with
resignation
there
is
something
too
in
real
sorrow
that
tends
to
enlarge
and
exalt
the
soul
but
the
imaginary
evils
of
our
own
creating
can
only
serve
to
contract
and
depress
it
lennox
shook
her
head
ah
charles
you
may
depend
upon
it
your
reasoning
is
wrong
and
you
will
be
convinced
of
it
some
day
i
am
convinced
of
it
already
i
begin
to
fear
this
discussion
will
frighten
miss
douglas
away
from
us
is
an
evil
anticipated
now
do
you
my
dear
mother
help
me
to
avert
it
where
that
can
be
done
it
can
not
be
too
soon
apprehended
as
colonel
lennox
character
unfolded
itself
mary
saw
much
to
admire
in
it
and
it
is
more
than
probable
the
admiration
would
soon
have
been
reciprocal
had
it
been
allowed
to
take
its
course
but
good
lennox
would
force
it
into
a
thousand
little
channels
prepared
by
herself
and
love
itself
must
have
been
quickly
exhausted
by
the
perpetual
demands
that
were
made
upon
it
mary
would
have
been
deeply
mortified
had
she
suspected
the
cause
of
her
friend
solicitude
to
show
her
off
but
she
was
a
stranger
to
in
all
its
bearings
had
scarcely
ever
read
a
novel
in
her
life
and
was
consequently
not
at
all
aware
of
the
necessity
there
was
for
her
falling
in
love
with
all
convenient
speed
she
was
therefore
sometimes
amused
though
oftener
ashamed
at
lennox
panegyrics
and
could
not
but
smile
as
she
thought
how
aunt
jacky
wrath
would
have
been
kindled
had
she
heard
the
extravagant
praises
that
were
bestowed
on
her
most
trifling
accomplishments
you
must
sing
my
favourite
song
to
charles
my
love
he
has
never
heard
you
sing
pray
do
you
did
not
use
to
require
any
entreaty
from
me
mary
many
a
time
you
have
gladdened
my
heart
with
your
songs
when
but
for
you
it
would
have
been
filled
with
mournful
thoughts
mary
finding
whatever
she
did
or
did
she
was
destined
to
hear
only
her
own
praises
was
glad
to
take
refuge
at
the
harp
to
which
she
sang
the
following
ancient
ditty
sweet
day
so
cool
so
calm
so
bright
the
bridal
of
the
earth
and
sky
sweet
dews
shall
weep
thy
fall
for
thou
must
die
sweet
rose
whose
hue
angry
and
brave
bids
the
rash
gazer
wipe
his
eye
thy
root
is
ever
in
its
grave
and
thou
must
die
sweet
spring
full
of
sweet
days
and
roses
a
box
where
sweets
compacted
lie
my
music
shows
you
have
your
closes
and
all
must
die
only
a
sweet
and
virtuous
soul
like
season
timber
never
gives
but
when
the
whole
world
turns
to
coal
then
chiefly
lives
that
said
colonel
lennox
is
one
of
the
any
exquisite
little
pieces
of
poetry
which
are
to
be
found
like
jewels
in
an
ethiop
ear
in
my
favourite
isaac
walton
the
title
of
the
book
offers
no
encouragement
to
female
readers
but
i
know
few
works
from
which
i
rise
with
such
renovated
feelings
of
benevolence
and
indeed
i
know
no
author
who
has
given
with
so
much
enchanting
a
picture
of
a
pious
and
contented
mind
here
taking
the
book
from
a
shelf
and
turning
over
the
leaves
is
one
of
the
passages
which
has
so
often
charmed
me
very
hour
which
you
were
absent
from
me
i
sat
down
under
a
willow
by
the
and
considered
what
you
had
told
me
of
the
owner
of
that
pleasant
meadow
in
which
you
left
me
that
he
has
a
plentiful
estate
and
not
a
heart
to
think
so
that
he
has
at
this
time
many
lawsuits
depending
and
that
they
both
damped
his
mirth
and
took
up
so
much
of
his
time
and
thoughts
that
he
himself
had
not
leisure
to
take
that
sweet
comfort
i
who
pretended
no
title
to
them
took
in
his
fields
for
i
could
there
sit
quietly
and
looking
in
the
water
see
some
fishes
sport
themselves
in
the
silver
streams
others
leaping
at
flies
of
several
shapes
and
colours
looking
on
the
hills
i
could
behold
them
spotted
with
woods
and
groves
looking
down
upon
the
meadows
i
could
see
here
a
boy
gathering
lilies
and
and
there
a
girl
cropping
culverkeys
and
cowslips
all
to
make
garlands
suitable
to
this
present
month
of
may
these
and
many
other
field
flowers
so
perfumed
the
air
that
i
thought
that
very
meadow
like
that
field
in
sicily
of
which
diodorus
speaks
where
the
perfumes
arising
from
the
place
make
all
dogs
that
hunt
in
it
to
fall
off
and
lose
their
scent
i
say
as
i
thus
sat
joying
in
my
own
happy
condition
and
pitying
this
poor
rich
man
that
owned
this
and
many
other
pleasant
groves
and
meadows
about
me
i
did
then
thankfully
remember
what
my
saviour
said
that
the
possess
the
earth
or
rather
they
enjoy
what
the
others
possess
and
enjoy
not
for
anglers
and
men
are
free
from
those
high
those
restless
thoughts
which
corrode
the
sweets
of
life
and
they
and
they
only
can
say
as
the
poet
has
happily
expressed
it
blest
estate
of
lowliness
happy
enjoyments
of
such
minds
as
rich
in
can
like
the
reeds
in
roughest
winds
by
yielding
make
that
blow
but
small
by
which
proud
oaks
and
cedars
fall
there
is
both
poetry
and
painting
in
such
prose
as
this
said
mary
but
i
should
certainly
as
soon
have
thought
of
looking
for
a
pearl
necklace
in
a
fishpond
as
of
finding
pretty
poetry
in
a
treatise
upon
the
art
of
angling
that
book
was
a
favourite
of
your
father
charles
said
lennox
and
i
remember
in
our
happiest
days
he
used
to
read
parts
of
it
to
me
one
passage
in
particular
made
a
strong
impression
upon
me
though
i
little
thought
then
it
would
ever
apply
to
me
it
is
upon
the
blessings
of
sight
indulge
me
by
reading
it
to
me
once
again
colonel
lennox
made
an
effort
to
conquer
his
feelings
while
he
read
as
follows
what
would
a
blind
man
give
to
see
the
pleasant
rivers
and
meadows
and
flowers
and
fountains
that
we
have
met
with
i
have
been
told
that
if
a
man
that
was
born
blind
could
attain
to
have
his
sight
for
only
one
during
his
whole
life
and
should
at
the
first
opening
of
his
eyes
fix
his
sight
upon
the
sun
when
it
was
in
its
full
glory
either
at
the
rising
or
the
setting
he
would
be
transported
and
amazed
and
so
admire
the
glory
of
it
that
he
would
not
willingly
turn
his
eyes
from
that
first
ravishing
object
to
behold
all
the
other
various
beauties
this
world
could
present
to
them
and
this
and
many
other
like
objects
we
enjoy
daily
a
deep
sigh
from
lennox
made
bier
son
look
up
her
eyes
were
bathed
in
tears
he
threw
his
arms
around
her
my
dearest
mother
cried
he
in
a
voice
choked
with
agitation
how
cruel
how
unthinking
thus
to
remind
you
do
not
reproach
yourself
for
my
weakness
dear
charles
but
i
was
thinking
how
much
rather
could
i
have
my
sight
but
for
one
hour
i
would
look
upon
the
face
of
my
own
child
than
on
all
the
glories
of
the
creation
colonel
lennox
was
too
deeply
affected
to
speak
he
pressed
his
hand
to
his
lips
then
rose
abruptly
and
quitted
the
room
mary
succeeded
in
soothing
her
weak
and
agitated
spirits
into
composure
but
the
chord
of
feeling
had
been
jarred
and
all
her
efforts
to
restore
it
to
its
former
tone
proved
abortive
for
the
rest
of
the
day
chapter

friendship
is

in

that
mary
felt
too
happy
in
the
change
to
be
in
any
hurry
to
quit
it
but
an
unfortunate
discovery
soon
turned
all
her
enjoyment
into
bitterness
of
heart
and
rose
hall
from
being
to
her
a
place
of
rest
was
suddenly
transformed
into
an
abode
too
hateful
to
be
endured
it
happened
one
day
as
she
entered
the
lennox
was
as
usual
assailing
the
heart
of
her
son
in
her
behalf
a
large
indian
screen
divided
the
room
and
mary
entrance
was
neither
seen
nor
heard
till
she
was
close
by
them
oh
certainly
miss
douglas
is
all
that
you
say
very
pretty
very
amiable
and
very
accomplished
said
colonel
lennox
with
a
sort
of
yawn
in
answer
to
a
eulogium
of
his
mother
then
why
not
love
her
ah
charles
promise
me
that
you
will
at
least
try
said
the
good
old
lady
laying
her
hand
upon
his
with
the
greatest
earnestness
this
was
said
when
mary
was
actually
standing
before
her
to
hear
the
words
and
to
feel
their
application
was
a
flash
of
lightning
and
for
a
moment
she
felt
as
if
her
brain
were
on
fire
she
was
alive
but
to
one
idea
and
that
the
most
painful
that
could
be
suggested
to
a
delicate
mind
she
had
heard
herself
recommended
to
the
love
of
a
man
who
was
indifferent
to
her
could
there
be
such
a
humiliation
such
a
degradation
colonel
lennox
embarrassment
was
scarcely
less
but
his
mother
saw
not
the
mischief
she
had
done
and
she
continued
to
speak
without
his
having
the
power
to
interrupt
her
but
her
words
fell
unheeded
on
mary
ear
she
could
hear
nothing
but
what
she
had
already
heard
colonel
lennox
rose
and
respectfully
placed
a
chair
for
her
but
the
action
was
unnoticed
she
saw
only
herself
a
suppliant
for
his
love
and
insensible
to
everything
but
her
own
feelings
she
turned
and
hastily
quitted
the
room
without
uttering
a
syllable
to
fly
from
rose
hall
never
again
to
enter
it
was
her
first
resolution
yet
how
was
she
to
do
so
without
coming
to
an
explanation
worse
even
than
the
cause
itself
for
she
had
that
very
morning
yielded
to
the
solicitations
of
lennox
and
consented
to
remain
till
the
following
day
oh
thought
she
as
the
scalding
tears
of
shame
for
the
first
time
dropped
from
her
eyes
what
a
situation
am
i
placed
in
to
continue
to
live
under
the
same
roof
with
the
man
whom
i
have
heard
solicited
to
love
me
and
how
mean
how
despicable
must
i
appear
in
his
eyes
thus
offered
rejected
how
shall
i
ever
be
able
to
convince
him
that
i
care
not
for
his
love
that
i
wished
it
not
that
i
would
refuse
scorn
it
were
it
offered
to
me
oh
could
i
but
tell
him
so
but
he
must
ever
remain
stranger
to
my
real
sentiments
he
might
reject
but
can
not
disavow
and
yet
to
have
him
think
that
i
have
all
this
while
been
laying
snares
for
him
that
all
this
parade
of
my
acquirements
was
for
the
purpose
of
gaining
his
affections
oh
how
blind
and
stupid
i
was
not
to
see
through
the
injudicious
praises
of
lennox
i
should
not
then
have
suffered
this
degradation
in
the
eyes
of
her
son
hours
passed
away
unheeded
by
mary
while
she
was
giving
way
to
the
wounded
sensibility
of
a
naturally
high
spirit
and
acute
feelings
thus
violently
excited
in
all
their
first
ardour
at
length
she
was
recalled
to
herself
by
hearing
the
sound
of
a
carriage
as
it
passed
under
her
window
and
immediately
after
she
received
a
message
to
repair
to
the
to
her
cousin
lady
emily
how
fortunate
thought
she
i
shall
now
get
away
no
matter
how
or
where
i
shall
go
never
again
to
return
and
unconscious
of
the
agitation
visible
in
her
countenance
she
hastily
descended
impatient
to
bid
an
eternal
adieu
to
her
once
loved
rose
hall
she
found
lady
emily
and
colonel
lennox
together
eyes
less
penetrating
than
her
cousin
would
easily
have
discovered
the
state
of
poor
mary
mind
as
she
entered
the
room
her
beating
heart
her
flushed
cheek
and
averted
eye
all
declared
the
perturbation
of
her
spirits
and
lady
emily
regarded
her
for
a
moment
with
an
expression
of
surprise
that
served
to
heighten
her
confusion
i
have
no
doubt
i
am
a
very
unwelcome
visitor
here
to
all
parties
said
she
for
i
come
how
shall
i
declare
it
to
carry
you
home
mary
by
command
of
lady
juliana
no
no
exclaimed
mary
eagerly
you
are
quite
welcome
i
am
quite
ready
i
was
wishing
i
was
waiting
then
recollecting
herself
she
blushed
still
deeper
at
her
own
precipitation
there
is
no
occasion
to
be
so
vehemently
obedient
said
her
cousin
am
not
quite
ready
neither
am
i
wishing
or
waiting
to
be
off
in
such
a
hurry
colonel
lennox
and
i
had
just
set
about
reviving
an
old
acquaintance
begun
i
ca
tell
when
and
broken
off
when
i
was
a
thing
in
the
nursery
with
a
blue
sash
and
red
fingers
i
have
promised
him
that
when
he
comes
to
beech
park
you
shall
sing
him
my
favourite
scotch
song
auld
acquaintance
be
forgot
i
would
sing
it
myself
if
i
could
but
i
think
every
englishwoman
who
pretends
to
sing
scotch
songs
ought
to
have
the
bowstring
then
turning
to
the
harpsichord
she
began
to
play
it
with
exquisite
taste
and
feeling
there
said
she
rising
with
equal
levity
is
not
that
worth
all
the
formal
bows
and
to
have
had
the
pleasure
and
time
since
i
had
the
honour
and
such
sort
of
hateful
reminiscences
that
make
one
feel
nothing
but
that
they
area
great
deal
older
and
uglier
stupider
and
more
formal
than
they
were
so
many
years
before
where
the
early
ties
of
the
heart
remain
unbroken
said
colonel
lennox
with
some
emotion
such
remembrances
do
indeed
give
it
back
all
its
first
freshness
but
it
can
not
be
to
everyone
a
pleasure
to
have
its
feelings
awakened
even
by
tones
such
as
these
there
was
nothing
of
austerity
in
this
on
the
contrary
there
was
so
much
sweetness
mingled
with
the
melancholy
which
shaded
his
countenance
that
even
lady
emily
was
touched
and
for
a
moment
silent
the
entrance
of
lennox
relieved
her
from
her
embarrassment
she
flew
towards
her
and
taking
her
hand
my
dear
lennox
i
feel
very
much
as
if
i
were
come
here
in
the
capacity
of
an
executioner
no
not
exactly
that
but
rather
a
sort
of
constable
or
bailiff
for
i
am
come
on
the
part
of
lady
juliana
douglas
to
summon
you
to
surrender
the
person
of
her
daughter
to
be
disposed
of
as
she
in
her
wisdom
may
think
fit
not
surely
cried
lennox
in
alarm
my
orders
are
peremptory
the
suit
is
pressing
with
a
significant
smile
to
mary
this
day
oh
ye
hours
looking
at
a
timepiece
this
very
minute
come
mary
are
you
ready
at
another
time
mary
would
have
thought
only
of
the
regrets
of
her
venerable
friend
at
parting
with
her
but
now
she
felt
only
her
own
impatience
to
be
gone
and
she
hastily
quitted
the
room
to
prepare
for
her
departure
on
returning
to
it
colonel
lennox
advanced
to
meet
her
evidently
desirous
of
saying
something
yet
labouring
under
great
embarrassment
were
it
not
too
selfish
and
presumptuous
said
he
while
his
heightened
colour
spoke
his
confusion
i
would
venture
to
express
a
hope
that
your
absence
will
not
be
very
long
from
my
poor
mother
mary
pretended
to
be
very
busy
collecting
her
work
drawings
which
lay
scattered
about
and
merely
bent
her
head
in
acknowledgment
colonel
lennox
proceeded
i
am
aware
of
the
sacrifice
it
must
be
to
such
as
miss
douglas
to
devote
her
time
and
talents
to
the
comforting
of
the
blind
and
desolate
and
i
can
not
express
she
can
not
conceive
the
gratitude
the
respect
the
admiration
with
which
my
heart
is
filled
at
such
proofs
of
noble
disinterested
benevolence
on
her
part
had
mary
raised
her
eyes
to
those
that
vainly
sought
to
meet
hers
she
would
there
have
read
all
and
more
than
had
been
expressed
but
she
could
only
think
he
has
been
entreated
to
love
and
at
that
humiliating
idea
she
bent
her
head
still
lower
to
the
colour
that
dyed
her
cheek
to
an
almost
painful
degree
while
a
sense
of
suffocation
at
her
throat
prevented
her
disclaiming
as
she
wished
to
do
the
merit
of
any
sacrifice
some
sketches
of
lochmarlie
lay
upon
a
table
at
which
she
had
been
drawing
the
day
before
they
had
ever
been
precious
in
her
sight
till
now
but
they
only
excited
feelings
of
mortification
as
she
recollected
having
taken
them
from
her
at
request
to
show
to
her
son
this
was
part
of
the
parade
by
which
i
was
to
win
him
thought
she
with
bitterness
and
scarcely
conscious
of
what
she
did
she
crushed
them
together
and
threw
them
into
the
fire
then
hastily
advancing
to
lennox
she
tried
to
bid
her
farewell
but
as
she
thought
it
was
for
the
last
time
tears
of
tenderness
as
well
as
pride
stood
in
her
eyes
god
bless
you
my
dear
child
said
the
unsuspecting
lennox
as
she
held
her
in
her
arms
and
god
bless
you
in
his
way
though
his
ways
are
not
as
our
ways
i
can
not
urge
you
to
return
to
this
dreary
abode
but
oh
mary
think
sometimes
in
your
gaiety
that
when
you
do
come
you
bring
gladness
to
a
mournful
heart
and
lighten
eyes
that
never
see
the
sun
mary
too
much
affected
to
reply
could
only
wring
the
hand
of
her
venerable
friend
as
she
tore
herself
from
her
embrace
and
followed
lady
emily
to
the
carriage
for
some
time
they
proceeded
in
silence
mary
dreaded
to
encounter
her
cousin
eyes
which
she
was
aware
were
fixed
upon
her
with
more
than
their
usual
scrutiny
she
therefore
kept
hers
steadily
employed
in
surveying
the
objects
the
road
presented
at
length
her
ladyship
began
in
a
grave
tone
you
appear
to
have
had
very
stormy
weather
at
rose
hall
very
much
so
replied
mary
without
knowing
very
well
what
she
said
and
we
have
had
nothing
but
calms
and
sunshine
at
beech
park
is
not
that
strange
very
singular
indeed
i
left
the
barometer
very
high
not
quite
at
that
would
be
too
much
but
i
find
it
very
low
indeed
absolutely
below
nothing
mary
now
did
look
up
in
some
surprise
but
she
hastily
withdrew
from
the
intolerable
expression
of
her
cousin
eyes
dear
lady
emily
cried
she
in
a
deprecating
tone
well
what
more
you
ca
suppose
i
to
put
up
with
hearing
my
own
name
i
heard
that
fifty
times
already
from
lady
parrot
come
your
face
speaks
volumes
i
read
a
declaration
of
love
in
the
colour
of
your
cheeks
a
refusal
in
the
height
of
your
nose
and
a
sort
of
general
agitation
in
the
quiver
of
your
lip
and
the
of
your
hair
now
for
your
pulse
a
hasty
as
redgill
would
say
but
let
your
tongue
declare
the
rest
mary
would
fain
have
concealed
the
cause
of
her
distress
from
every
human
being
as
she
felt
as
if
degraded
still
lower
by
repeating
it
to
another
and
she
remained
silent
struggling
with
her
emotions
my
honour
mary
you
really
do
use
great
liberties
with
my
patience
and
i
appeal
to
yourself
whether
i
might
not
just
as
well
have
been
reading
one
of
tully
orations
to
a
mule
all
this
while
come
you
must
really
make
haste
to
tell
your
tale
for
i
am
dying
to
disclose
mine
or
shall
i
begin
no
that
would
be
inverting
the
order
of
nature
or
custom
which
is
the
same
thing
beginning
with
the
farce
and
ending
with
the
tragedy
so
au
commencement
thus
urged
mary
at
length
and
with
much
hesitation
related
to
her
cousin
the
humiliation
she
had
experienced
and
after
all
said
she
as
she
ended
i
am
afraid
i
behaved
very
like
a
fool
and
yet
what
could
i
do
in
my
situation
what
would
you
have
done
done
why
i
should
have
taken
the
old
woman
by
the
shoulder
and
cried
boh
in
her
ear
and
so
this
is
the
mighty
matter
you
happen
to
overhear
lennox
good
old
soul
recommending
you
as
a
wife
to
her
son
what
could
be
more
natural
except
his
refusing
to
fall
head
in
ears
in
love
before
he
had
time
to
pull
his
boots
off
and
then
to
have
a
wife
recommended
to
him
and
all
your
perfections
set
forth
as
if
you
had
been
a
laundrymaid
an
early
riser
neat
worker
regular
attention
upon
church
ugh
i
i
must
say
i
think
his
conduct
quite
meritorious
i
could
almost
find
in
my
heart
to
fall
in
love
with
him
myself
were
it
for
no
other
reason
than
because
he
is
not
such
a
tommy
goodchild
as
to
be
in
love
at
his
mamma
bidding
that
is
loving
his
mother
as
he
does
for
i
see
he
could
cut
off
a
hand
or
pluck
out
an
eye
to
please
her
though
he
ca
or
wo
give
her
his
heart
and
soul
to
dispose
of
as
she
thinks
proper
you
quite
misunderstand
me
said
mary
with
increasing
vexation
i
did
not
mean
to
say
anything
against
colonel
lennox
i
did
not
wish
i
never
once
thought
whether
he
liked
me
or
not
that
says
very
little
for
you
you
must
have
a
very
bad
taste
if
you
care
more
for
the
mother
liking
than
the
son
then
what
vexes
you
so
much
is
it
at
having
made
the
discovery
that
your
good
old
friend
is
a
a
i
beg
your
pardon
a
bit
of
a
goose
well
never
mind
since
you
do
care
for
the
man
there
no
mischief
done
you
have
only
to
change
the
fancy
that
you
overheard
mere
commending
you
to
redgill
for
your
skill
in
cookery
you
only
have
laughed
at
that
so
why
should
you
weep
at
however
one
thing
i
must
tell
you
whether
it
adds
to
your
grief
or
not
i
did
remark
that
charles
lennox
looked
very
towards
you
and
indeed
this
sentimental
passion
he
has
put
you
in
becomes
you
excessively
i
really
never
saw
you
look
so
handsome
before
it
has
given
an
energy
and
to
your
countenance
which
is
the
only
thing
it
wants
you
are
very
much
obliged
to
him
were
it
only
for
having
kindled
such
a
fire
in
your
eyes
and
raised
such
a
carnation
in
your
cheek
it
would
have
been
long
before
good
lennox
would
have
done
as
much
for
you
i
should
wonder
were
he
to
fall
in
love
with
you
after
all
lady
emily
little
thought
how
near
she
was
the
the
truth
when
she
talked
in
this
random
way
colonel
lennox
saw
the
wound
he
had
innocently
inflicted
on
mary
feelings
and
a
warmer
sentiment
than
any
he
had
hitherto
experienced
had
sprung
up
in
his
heart
formerly
he
had
merely
looked
upon
her
as
an
amiable
girl
but
when
he
saw
he
roused
to
a
sense
of
her
own
dignity
and
marked
the
struggle
betwixt
tender
affection
and
offended
delicacy
he
formed
a
higher
estimate
of
her
character
and
a
spark
was
kindled
that
wanted
but
opportunity
to
blaze
into
a
flame
pure
and
bright
as
the
shrine
on
which
it
burned
such
is
the
waywardness
and
price
of
even
the
best
affections
of
the
human
breast

and
now
said
lady

that
i

listened
to
your
story
which
after
all
is
really
a
very
poor
affair
do
you

to

hero

from
beech
park
was
the
day
destined
to
decide
your
fate
and
dash
your
hopes
if
ever
you
had
any
of
becoming
duchess
of
altamont
the
duke
arrived
i
know
for
the
express
purpose
of
being
enamoured
of
you
but
alas
you
were
not
and
there
was
adelaide
so
sweet
so
gracious
so
beautiful
the
poor
gull
was
caught
and
is
now
i
really
believe
as
much
in
love
as
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
stupid
man
to
be
i
must
own
she
has
played
her
part
admirably
and
has
made
more
use
of
her
time
than
i
with
all
my
rapidity
could
have
thought
possible
in
fact
the
duke
is
now
all
but
her
declared
lover
and
that
merely
stands
upon
a
point
of
punctilio
but
lord
lindore
exclaimed
mary
in
astonishment
why
that
part
of
the
story
is
what
i
quite
comprehend
sometimes
i
think
it
is
a
struggle
with
adelaide
lindore
poor
handsome
captivating
on
one
hand
his
grace
rich
stupid
magnificent
on
the
other
as
for
lindore
he
seems
to
stand
quite
aloof
formerly
you
know
he
never
used
to
stir
from
her
side
or
notice
anyone
else
now
he
scarcely
notices
her
at
least
in
presence
of
the
duke
sometimes
he
affects
to
look
unhappy
but
i
believe
it
is
mere
affectation
i
doubt
if
he
ever
thought
seriously
of
adelaide
or
indeed
anybody
else
that
he
could
have
in
a
straightforward
ally
croker
sort
of
a
way
but
something
too
much
of
this
while
all
this
has
been
going
on
in
one
corner
there
comes
regularly
everyday
william
downe
wright
looking
very
much
as
if
he
had
lost
his
shoestring
or
pocket
handkerchief
and
had
come
there
to
look
for
it
i
had
some
suspicion
of
the
nature
of
the
loss
but
was
hopeful
he
would
have
the
sense
to
keep
it
to
himself
no
such
thing
he
yesterday
stumbled
upon
lady
juliana
all
alone
and
in
the
weakest
of
his
weak
moments
informed
her
that
the
loss
he
had
sustained
was
no
less
than
the
loss
of
that
precious
jewel
his
heart
and
that
the
object
of
his
search
was
no
other
than
that
of
miss
mary
douglas
to
replace
it
he
even
carried
his
so
far
as
to
request
her
permission
or
her
influence
or
in
short
something
that
her
ladyship
never
was
asked
for
by
any
mortal
in
their
senses
before
to
aid
him
in
his
pursuit
you
know
how
it
delights
her
to
be
dressed
in
a
little
brief
authority
so
you
may
conceive
her
transports
at
seeing
the
sceptre
of
power
thus
placed
in
her
hands
in
the
heat
of
her
pride
she
makes
the
matter
known
to
the
whole
household
redgills
cooks
scullions
all
are
quite
to
your
marriage
with
downe
wright
so
i
hope
allow
that
it
was
about
time
be
made
acquainted
with
it
yourself
but
why
so
pale
and
poor
mary
was
indeed
shocked
at
her
cousin
intelligence
with
the
highest
feelings
of
filial
reverence
she
found
herself
perpetually
called
upon
either
to
sacrifice
her
own
principles
or
to
act
indirect
opposition
to
her
mother
will
and
upon
this
occasion
she
saw
nothing
but
endless
altercation
awaiting
her
for
her
heart
revolted
from
the
indelicacy
of
such
measures
and
she
could
not
for
a
moment
brook
the
idea
of
being
in
marriage
but
she
had
little
time
for
reflection
they
were
now
at
beech
park
and
as
she
alighted
a
servant
informed
her
lady
juliana
wished
to
see
her
in
her
immediately
thither
she
repaired
with
a
beating
heart
and
agitated
step
she
was
received
with
greater
kindness
than
she
had
ever
yet
experienced
from
her
mother
come
in
my
dear
cried
she
as
she
extended
two
fingers
to
her
and
slightly
touched
her
cheek
you
look
very
well
this
morning
much
better
than
usual
your
complexion
is
much
improved
at
the
same
time
you
must
be
sensible
how
few
girls
are
married
merely
for
their
looks
that
is
married
well
unless
to
be
sure
their
beauty
is
something
such
as
your
sister
for
instance
i
assure
you
it
is
an
extraordinary
piece
of
good
fortune
in
a
merely
pretty
girl
to
make
what
is
vulgarly
called
a
good
match
i
know
at
least
twenty
really
very
nice
young
women
at
this
moment
who
can
not
get
themselves
established
mary
was
silent
and
her
mother
delighted
at
her
own
good
sense
and
judicious
observations
went
on
that
being
the
case
you
may
judge
how
very
comfortable
i
must
feel
at
having
managed
to
procure
for
you
a
most
excessive
good
establishment
just
the
very
thing
i
have
long
wished
as
i
have
felt
quite
at
a
loss
about
you
of
late
my
dear
when
your
sister
marries
i
shall
of
course
reside
with
her
and
as
i
consider
your
those
scotch
people
as
completely
at
an
end
i
have
really
been
quite
wretched
as
to
what
was
to
become
of
you
i
ca
tell
you
therefore
how
excessively
relieved
i
was
when
downe
wright
yesterday
asked
my
permission
to
address
you
of
course
i
could
not
hesitate
an
instant
so
you
will
meet
him
at
dinner
as
your
accepted
your
hair
is
rather
blown
i
shall
send
fanchon
to
dress
it
for
you
you
have
really
got
very
pretty
hair
i
wonder
never
remarked
it
before
oh
and
downe
wright
is
to
wait
upon
me
i
think
and
then
i
believe
we
must
return
the
visit
there
is
a
sort
of
etiquette
you
know
in
all
these
matters
that
is
the
most
unpleasant
part
of
it
but
when
that
is
over
you
will
have
nothing
to
think
of
but
ordering
your
things
for
a
few
minutes
mary
was
too
much
confounded
by
her
mother
rapidity
to
reply
she
had
expected
to
be
urged
to
accept
of
downe
wright
but
to
be
told
that
was
actually
done
for
her
was
more
than
she
was
prepared
for
at
length
she
found
voice
to
say
that
downe
wright
was
almost
a
stranger
to
her
and
she
must
therefore
be
excused
from
receiving
his
addresses
at
present
how
excessively
childish
exclaimed
lady
juliana
angrily
i
hear
of
anything
so
perfectly
foolish
you
know
or
at
any
rate
i
do
all
that
is
necessary
to
know
i
know
that
he
is
a
man
of
family
and
fortune
heir
to
a
title
uncommonly
handsome
and
remarkably
sensible
and
i
ca
conceive
what
more
you
would
wish
to
know
i
would
wish
to
know
something
of
his
character
his
principles
his
habits
temper
talents
in
short
all
those
things
on
which
my
happiness
would
depend
character
and
principles
one
would
suppose
you
were
talking
of
your
footman
downe
wright
character
is
perfectly
good
i
never
heard
anything
against
it
as
to
what
you
call
his
principles
i
must
profess
my
ignorance
i
really
ca
tell
whether
he
is
a
methodist
but
know
he
is
a
gentleman
has
a
large
fortune
is
very
and
is
not
at
all
dissipated
i
believe
in
short
you
are
most
excessively
fortunate
in
meeting
with
such
a
man
but
i
have
not
the
slightest
partiality
for
him
said
mary
colouring
it
can
not
be
expected
that
i
should
when
i
have
not
been
half
a
dozen
time
in
his
company
i
must
be
allowed
some
time
before
i
can
consent
even
to
consider
i
do
mean
that
you
are
to
marry
it
may
probably
be
six
weeks
or
two
months
before
everything
can
be
arranged
mary
saw
she
must
speak
boldly
but
i
must
be
allowed
much
longer
time
before
i
can
consider
myself
as
sufficiently
acquainted
with
downe
wright
to
think
of
him
at
all
in
that
light
and
even
then
he
may
be
very
amiable
and
yet
hesitating
i
may
not
be
able
to
love
him
as
i
ought
love
exclaimed
lady
juliana
her
eyes
sparkling
with
anger
i
desire
i
may
never
hear
that
word
again
from
any
daughter
of
mine
i
am
determined
i
shall
have
no
disgraceful
in
the
family
no
young
woman
ever
thinks
of
such
a
thing
now
and
i
hear
a
syllable
on
the
subject
i
shall
never
marry
anybody
i
am
sure
that
you
disapprove
of
said
mary
timidly
no
i
shall
take
care
of
that
i
consider
it
the
duty
of
parents
to
establish
their
children
properly
in
the
world
without
any
regard
to
their
ideas
on
the
subject
i
think
i
must
be
rather
a
better
judge
of
the
matter
than
you
can
possibly
be
and
i
shall
therefore
make
a
point
of
your
forming
what
i
consider
a
proper
alliance
your
sister
i
know
wo
hesitate
to
sacrifice
her
own
affections
to
please
me
she
was
most
excessively
attached
to
lord
lindore
everybody
knew
that
but
she
is
convinced
of
the
propriety
of
preferring
the
duke
of
altamont
and
wo
hesitate
in
sacrificing
her
own
feelings
to
mine
but
indeed
she
has
ever
been
all
that
i
could
wish
so
perfectly
beautiful
and
at
the
same
time
so
excessively
affectionate
and
obedient
she
approves
entirely
of
your
marriage
with
downe
wright
as
indeed
all
your
friends
do
i
do
include
friend
lady
emily
in
that
number
i
look
upon
her
as
a
most
improper
companion
for
you
and
the
sooner
you
are
separated
from
her
the
better
so
now
for
the
present
you
have
only
to
behave
as
other
young
ladies
do
upon
those
occasions
which
is
generally
to
give
as
much
trouble
to
their
friends
as
they
possibly
can
there
are
some
people
who
furious
themselves
at
opposition
can
not
understand
the
possibility
of
others
being
equally
firm
and
decided
in
a
gentle
manner
lady
juliana
was
one
of
those
who
always
expect
to
carry
their
point
by
a
raised
voice
and
sparkling
eyes
and
it
was
with
difficulty
mary
with
her
timid
air
and
gentle
accents
could
convince
her
that
she
was
determined
to
judge
for
herself
in
a
matter
in
which
her
happiness
was
so
deeply
involved
when
at
last
brought
to
comprehend
it
her
ladyship
indignation
knew
no
bounds
and
mary
was
accused
in
the
same
breath
with
having
formed
some
low
connection
in
scotland
and
of
seeking
to
supplant
her
sister
by
aspiring
to
the
duke
of
altamont
and
at
length
the
conference
ended
pretty
much
where
it
began
lady
juliana
resolved
that
her
daughter
should
marry
to
please
her
and
her
daughter
equally
resolved
not
to
be
driven
into
an
engagement
from
which
her
heart
recoiled

when
mary
entered
the
she
found
herself
without
knowing
how
by
the
side
of
downe
wright
at
dinner
it
was
the
same
and
in
short
it
seemed
an
understood
thing
that
they
were
to
be
constantly
together
there
was
something
so
gentle
and
unassuming
in
his
manner
that
almost
provoked
as
she
was
by
the
folly
of
his
proceedings
she
found
it
impossible
to
resent
it
by
her
behaviour
towards
him
and
indeed
without
being
guilty
of
actual
rudeness
of
which
she
was
incapable
it
would
not
have
been
easy
to
have
made
him
comprehend
the
nature
of
her
sentiments
he
appeared
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
toleration
he
met
with
and
compared
to
adelaide
disdainful
glances
and
lady
biting
sarcasms
mary
gentleness
and
civility
might
well
be
mistaken
for
encouragement
but
even
under
the
exhilarating
influence
of
hope
and
high
spirits
his
conversation
was
so
insipid
and
commonplace
that
mary
found
it
a
relief
to
turn
even
to
redgill
it
was
evident
the
doctor
was
aware
of
what
was
going
on
for
he
regarded
her
with
that
increased
respect
due
to
the
future
mistress
of
a
splendid
establishment
between
the
courses
he
made
some
complimentary
allusions
to
highland
mutton
and
red
deer
and
he
even
carried
his
attentions
so
far
as
to
whisper
at
the
very
first
mouthful
that
côtellettes
de
were
superb
when
he
had
never
been
known
to
commend
anything
to
another
until
he
had
fully
discussed
it
himself
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
sat
adelaide
and
the
duke
of
altamont
the
latter
looking
still
more
heavy
and
inanimate
than
ever
the
operation
of
eating
over
he
seemed
unable
to
keep
himself
awake
and
every
now
and
then
yielded
to
a
gentle
slumber
from
which
however
he
was
instantly
recalled
at
the
sound
of
adelaide
voice
when
he
exclaimed
ah
charming
very
charming
ah
lady
emily
looked
them
as
she
hummed
some
part
of
dryden
ode
aloft
in
awful
state
the
godlike
hero
sate
etc
the
lovely
thais
by
his
side
look
like
a
blooming
eastern
bride
then
as
his
grace
closed
his
eyes
and
his
head
sank
on
his
shoulder
with
ravish
ears
the

the

lady
juliana
who
would
have
been
highly
incensed
had
she
suspected
the
application
of
the
words
was
so
unconscious
of
it
as
to
join
occasionally
in
singing
them
to
mary
great
confusion
and
manifest
displeasure
when
they
returned
to
the
heavens
adelaide
exclaimed
her
cousin
in
an
affected
manner
what
are
you
made
of
semelé
herself
was
but
a
mere
to
you
how
can
you
stand
such
a
jupiter
and
not
scorched
not
even
singed
i
protest
pretending
to
examine
her
all
over
i
vow
i
trembled
at
your
temerity
your
familiarity
with
the
imperial
nod
was
fearful
i
every
instant
expected
to
see
you
turned
into
a
live
coal
i
did
burn
said
adelaide
with
shame
to
see
the
mistress
of
a
house
forget
what
was
due
to
her
father
guests
there
a
slap
on
the
cheek
for
me
mercy
how
it
burns
no
i
did
not
forget
what
was
due
to
my
father
guests
on
the
contrary
i
consider
it
due
to
them
to
save
them
if
i
can
from
the
snares
that
i
see
set
for
them
i
have
told
you
that
i
abhor
all
traps
whether
for
the
poor
simple
mouse
that
comes
to
steal
its
bit
of
cheese
or
for
the
dull
elderly
gentleman
who
falls
asleep
with
a
star
on
his
breast
this
is
one
of
the
many
kind
and
polite
allusions
for
which
i
am
indebted
to
your
ladyship
said
adelaide
haughtily
but
i
trust
the
day
will
come
when
i
shall
be
able
to
discharge
what
i
owe
you
and
she
quitted
the
room
followed
by
lady
juliana
who
could
only
make
out
that
lady
emily
had
been
insolent
and
that
adelaide
was
offended
a
pause
followed
i
see
you
think
i
am
in
the
wrong
mary
i
can
read
that
in
the
little
reproachful
glance
you
gave
me
just
now
well
perhaps
i
am
but
i
own
it
chafes
my
spirit
to
sit
and
look
on
such
a
scene
of
iniquity
yes
iniquity
i
call
it
for
a
woman
to
be
in
love
with
one
man
and
at
the
same
time
laying
snares
for
another
you
may
think
perhaps
that
adelaide
has
no
heart
to
love
anything
but
she
has
a
heart
such
as
it
is
though
it
is
much
too
fine
for
use
and
therefore
it
is
kept
locked
up
in
marble
casket
quite
out
of
reach
of
you
or
i
but
mistaken
if
frederick
has
not
made
himself
master
of
it
not
that
i
should
blame
her
for
that
if
she
would
be
honestly
and
downrightly
in
love
with
him
but
how
despicable
to
see
her
with
her
affections
placed
upon
one
man
at
the
same
time
lavishing
all
her
attentions
on
another
and
that
other
if
he
had
been
plain
john
altamont
she
would
not
have
been
commonly
civil
to
and
of
civility
i
must
tell
you
if
you
mean
to
refuse
your
hero
you
were
too
civil
by
half
to
him
i
observed
you
at
dinner
you
sat
perfectly
straight
and
answered
everything
he
said
to
you
what
could
i
do
asked
mary
in
some
surprise
i
tell
you
what
i
would
have
done
and
have
thought
the
most
honourable
mode
of
proceeding
i
should
have
turned
my
back
upon
him
and
have
merely
thrown
him
a
monosyllable
now
and
then
over
my
shoulder
i
could
not
be
less
than
civil
to
him
and
i
am
sure
i
was
not
more
civility
is
too
much
for
a
man
one
means
to
refuse
you
never
get
rid
of
a
stupid
man
by
civility
whenever
i
had
any
reason
to
apprehend
a
lover
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
turn
short
upon
him
and
give
him
a
snarl
at
the
outset
which
rid
me
of
him
at
once
but
i
really
begin
to
think
i
manage
these
matters
better
than
anybody
else
i
love
i
profess
it
where
i
hate
in
every
circumstance
i
dare
proclaim
it
mary
tried
to
defend
her
sister
in
the
first
place
but
though
her
charity
would
not
allow
her
to
censure
her
conscience
whispered
there
was
much
to
condemn
and
she
was
relieved
from
what
she
felt
a
difficult
task
when
the
gentlemen
began
to
drop
in
in
spite
of
all
her
manoeuvres
downe
wright
contrived
to
be
next
her
and
whenever
she
changed
her
seat
she
was
sure
of
his
following
her
she
had
also
the
mortification
of
overhearing
lady
juliana
tell
the
duke
that
downe
wright
was
the
accepted
lover
of
her
youngest
daughter
that
he
was
a
man
of
large
fortune
and
heir
to
his
uncle
lord
glenallan
ah
a
nephew
of
my
lord
glenallan
indeed
a
pretty
young
man
like
the
family
poor
lord
glenallan
i
knew
him
very
well
he
has
had
the
palsy
since
then
poor
man
ah
the
following
day
mary
was
compelled
to
receive
downe
visit
but
she
as
scarcely
conscious
of
what
passed
for
colonel
lennox
arrived
at
the
same
time
and
it
was
equally
evident
that
his
visit
was
also
intended
for
her
she
felt
that
she
ought
to
appear
unconcerned
in
his
presence
and
he
tried
to
be
so
but
still
the
painful
idea
would
recur
that
he
had
been
solicited
to
love
her
and
unskilled
in
the
arts
of
even
innocent
deception
she
could
only
try
to
hide
the
agitation
under
the
coldness
of
her
manner
come
mary
cried
lady
emily
as
if
in
answer
to
something
colonel
lennox
had
addressed
to
her
in
a
low
voice
do
you
remember
the
promise
i
made
colonel
lennox
and
which
it
rests
with
you
to
perform
i
never
consider
myself
bound
to
perform
the
promises
of
others
replied
mary
gravely
in
some
cases
that
may
be
a
prudent
resolution
but
in
the
present
it
is
surely
an
unfriendly
one
said
colonel
lennox
a
most
inhuman
one
cried
lady
emily
since
you
and
i
it
seems
can
not
commence
our
friendship
without
something
sentimental
to
set
us
agoing
it
rests
with
you
mary
to
be
the
founder
of
our
friendship
and
if
you
manage
the
matter
well
that
is
sing
in
your
best
manner
we
shall
perhap
make
it
a
triple
alliance
and
admit
you
as
third
as
every
man
is
said
to
be
the
artificer
of
his
own
fortune
so
every
one
i
think
had
best
be
the
artificer
of
their
own
friendship
said
mary
trying
to
smile
as
she
pulled
her
embroidery
frame
towards
her
and
began
to
work
neither
can
be
the
worse
of
a
good
friend
to
help
them
on
observed
downe
wright
but
both
may
be
materially
injured
by
an
injudicious
one
said
colonel
lennox
and
although
on
this
occasion
i
am
the
greatest
sufferer
by
it
i
must
acknowledge
the
truth
of
miss
douglas
observation
friendship
and
love
i
believe
will
always
be
found
to
thrive
best
when
left
to
themselves
and
so
ends
my
novel
elegant
and
original
plan
for
striking
up
a
sudden
friendship
cried
lady
emily
pray
downe
wright
can
you
suggest
anything
better
for
the
purpose
than
an
old
song
downe
wright
who
was
not
at
all
given
to
suggesting
looked
a
little
embarrassed
pull
the
bell
william
for
the
carriage
said
his
mother
we
must
now
be
moving
and
with
a
general
obeisance
to
the
company
and
a
significant
pressure
of
the
hand
to
mary
she
withdrew
her
son
from
his
dilemma
although
a
shrewd
penetrating
woman
she
did
not
possess
that
tact
and
delicacy
necessary
to
comprehend
the
finer
feelings
of
a
mind
superior
to
her
own
and
in
mary
averted
looks
and
constrained
manner
she
saw
nothing
but
what
she
thought
quite
proper
and
natural
in
her
situation
as
for
lady
emily
she
observed
there
would
be
news
of
her
and
that
fine
colonel
yet
and
miss
adelaide
would
perhaps
come
down
a
pin
before
long
soon
after
colonel
lennox
took
his
leave
in
spite
of
lady
pressing
invitation
for
him
to
spend
the
day
there
and
meet
her
brother
who
had
been
absent
for
some
days
but
was
now
expected
home
he
promised
to
return
again
soon
and
departed
how
prodigiously
handsome
colonel
lennox
looked
said
she
addressing
mary
and
how
perfectly
unconscious
at
least
indifferent
he
seems
about
it
it
is
quite
refreshing
to
see
a
handsome
man
that
is
neither
a
fool
nor
a
coxcomb
handsome
no
i
do
think
he
is
very
handsome
said
lady
juliana
rather
dark
do
you
think
my
love
turning
to
adelaide
who
sat
apart
at
a
table
writing
and
had
scarcely
deigned
to
lift
her
head
all
the
time
who
do
you
mean
the
man
who
has
just
gone
out
is
his
name
lennox
yes
he
is
rather
handsome
i
believe
you
are
right
he
certainly
is
but
in
a
peculiar
style
i
do
quite
like
the
expression
of
his
eye
and
he
wants
that
air
which
indeed
belongs
exclusively
to
persons
of
birth
he
has
perfectly
the
air
of
a
man
of
fashion
said
adelaide
in
a
decided
tone
as
if
ashamed
to
agree
with
her
mother
perhaps
peu
militaire
but
nothing
at
all
professional
lennox
it
is
a
scotch
name
observed
lady
juliana
contemptuously
and
to
cut
the
matter
short
said
lady
emily
as
she
was
quitting
the
room
the
man
who
has
just
gone
out
is
colonel
lennox
and
not
the
duke
of
aitamont
after
a
few
more
awkward
indefinite
sort
of
visits
in
which
mary
found
it
impossible
to
come
to
an
explanation
she
was
relieved
for
the
present
from
the
assiduities
of
her
lover
lady
juliana
received
a
note
from
downe
wright
apologising
for
what
she
termed
her
unfortunate
absence
at
such
a
critical
time
but
he
had
received
accounts
of
the
alarming
illness
of
his
uncle
lord
glenallan
and
had
in
consequence
set
off
instantly
for
scotland
where
she
was
preparing
to
follow
concluding
with
particular
regards
to
miss
mary
hopes
of
being
soon
able
to
resume
their
pleasant
footing
in
the
family
etc
etc
how
excessively
well
arranged
it
will
be
that
old
man
dying
at
this
time
said
her
ladyship
as
she
tossed
the
note
to
her
daughter
lord
glenallan
will
sound
so
much
better
than
downe
wright
the
name
i
have
always
considered
as
the
only
objectionable
part
you
are
really
most
prodigiously
fortunate
mary
was
now
aware
of
the
folly
of
talking
reason
to
her
mother
and
remained
silent
thankful
for
the
present
peace
this
event
would
ensure
her
and
almost
tempted
to
wish
that
lord
glenallan
doom
might
not
speedily
be
decided
chapter
xx
it
seems
it
is
as
proper
to
our
age
to
cast
beyond
ourselves
in
our
opinions
as
it
is
common
for
the
younger
sort
to
lack
discretion
lord
lindore
and
colonel
lennox
has
been
boyish
acquaintances
and
a
sort
of
superficial
intimacy
was
soon
established
between
them
which
served
as
the
ostensible
cause
of
his
frequent
visits
at
beech
park
but
to
mary
who
was
more
alive
to
the
difference
of
their
characters
and
sentiments
than
any
other
member
of
the
family
this
appeared
very
improbable
and
she
could
not
help
suspecting
that
love
for
the
sister
rather
than
friendship
for
the
brother
was
the
real
motive
by
which
he
was
actuated
in
half
jesting
manner
she
mentioned
her
suspicions
to
lady
emily
who
treated
the
idea
with
her
usual
ridicule
i
really
could
not
have
supposed
you
so
extremely
mary
said
she
as
to
imagine
that
because
two
people
like
each
other
society
and
talk
and
laugh
together
a
little
more
than
usual
that
the
must
needs
be
in
love
i
believe
charles
lennox
loves
me
much
the
same
as
he
did
eleven
years
ago
when
i
was
a
little
wretch
that
used
to
pull
his
hair
and
spoil
his
watch
and
as
for
me
you
know
that
i
consider
myself
quite
as
an
old
woman
at
least
as
a
married
one
and
he
is
perfectly
to
my
engagement
with
edward
i
have
even
shown
him
his
picture
and
some
of
his
letters
mary
looked
incredulous
you
may
think
as
you
please
but
i
tell
you
it
is
so
in
my
situation
i
should
scorn
to
have
colonel
lennox
or
anybody
else
in
love
with
me
as
to
his
liking
to
talk
to
me
pray
who
else
can
he
talk
to
adelaide
would
sometimes
indeed
but
he
wo
be
condescended
to
that
clear
not
even
by
a
duchess
with
what
mock
humility
he
meets
her
airs
how
i
adore
him
for
it
then
you
are
such
a
pillar
of
ice
so
shy
and
unsociable
when
he
is
present
and
if
i
did
not
despise
recrimination
as
the
of
all
conscious
misses
i
would
say
you
are
much
more
the
object
of
his
at
least
than
i
am
several
times
i
have
caught
him
looking
very
earnestly
at
you
when
by
the
laws
of
good
breeding
his
eyes
ought
to
have
been
fixed
exclusively
upon
me
and
pshaw
interrupted
mary
colouring
that
is
mere
absence
nothing
to
the
purpose
or
perhaps
forcing
a
smile
he
may
be
to
love
me
mary
thought
of
her
poor
old
friend
as
she
said
this
with
bitterness
of
heart
it
was
long
since
she
had
seen
her
and
when
she
had
last
inquired
for
her
her
son
had
said
he
did
not
think
her
well
with
a
look
mary
could
not
misunderstand
she
had
heard
him
make
an
appointment
with
lord
lindore
for
the
following
day
and
she
took
the
opportunity
of
his
certain
absence
to
visit
his
mother
lennox
indeed
looked
ill
and
seemed
more
than
usually
depressed
she
welcomed
mary
with
her
usual
tenderness
but
even
her
presence
seemed
to
fail
of
inspiring
her
with
gladness
mary
found
she
was
totally
unsuspicious
of
the
cause
of
her
estrangement
and
imputed
it
to
a
very
different
one
you
have
been
a
great
stranger
my
dear
said
she
as
she
affectionately
embraced
her
but
at
such
a
time
i
could
not
expect
you
to
think
of
me
indeed
answered
mary
equally
unconscious
of
her
meaning
i
have
thought
much
and
often
very
often
upon
you
and
wished
i
could
have
come
to
you
but
she
stopped
for
she
could
not
tell
the
truth
and
would
not
utter
a
falsehood
i
understand
it
all
said
lennox
with
a
sigh
well
well
will
be
done
then
trying
to
be
more
cheerful
had
you
come
little
sooner
you
would
have
met
charles
he
is
just
gone
out
with
lord
lindore
he
was
unwilling
to
leave
me
as
he
always
is
and
when
he
does
i
believe
it
is
as
much
to
please
me
as
himself
ah
mary
i
once
hoped
that
i
might
have
lived
to
see
you
the
happy
wife
of
the
best
of
sons
i
may
speak
out
now
since
that
is
all
over
god
has
willed
otherwise
an
may
you
be
rewarded
in
the
choice
you
have
made
mary
was
struck
with
consternation
to
find
that
her
supposed
engagement
with
downe
wright
had
spread
even
to
rose
hall
and
in
the
greatest
confusion
she
attempted
to
deny
it
but
after
the
acknowledgment
she
had
just
heard
she
acquitted
herself
awkwardly
for
she
felt
as
if
an
open
explanation
would
only
serve
to
revive
hopes
that
never
could
be
realised
and
subject
colonel
lennox
and
herself
to
future
perplexities
nothing
but
the
whole
truth
would
have
sufficed
to
undeceive
lennox
for
she
had
had
the
intelligence
of
mary
engagement
from
downe
wright
herself
who
for
better
security
of
what
she
already
considered
her
son
property
had
taken
care
to
spread
the
report
of
his
being
the
accepted
lover
before
she
left
the
country
mary
felt
all
the
unpleasantness
of
her
situation
although
detesting
deceit
and
artifice
of
every
kind
her
confused
and
stammering
denials
seemed
rather
to
corroborate
the
fact
but
she
felt
that
she
could
not
declare
her
resolution
of
never
bestowing
her
hand
upon
downe
wright
without
seeming
at
the
same
time
to
court
the
addresss
of
colonel
lennox
then
how
painful
how
unjust
to
herself
as
well
as
cruel
to
him
to
have
it
for
an
instant
believed
that
she
was
the
betrothed
of
one
whose
wife
she
was
resolved
she
never
would
be
in
short
poor
mary
mind
was
a
complete
chaos
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
found
it
impossible
to
determine
which
was
the
right
course
for
her
to
pursue
even
in
the
midst
of
her
distress
however
she
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
of
the
good
old
remarks
he
is
a
handsome
young
man
i
hear
said
she
still
in
allusion
to
downe
wright
has
a
fine
fortune
and
an
easy
temper
all
these
things
help
people
happiness
though
they
can
not
make
it
and
his
choice
of
you
my
dear
mary
shows
that
he
has
some
sense
what
a
eulogium
said
mary
laughing
and
blushing
were
he
really
to
me
what
you
suppose
i
must
be
highly
flattered
but
i
must
again
assure
you
it
is
not
using
downe
wright
well
to
talk
of
him
as
anything
to
me
my
mother
indeed
ah
mary
my
dear
let
me
advise
you
to
beware
of
being
led
even
by
a
mother
in
such
a
matter
as
this
god
forbid
that
i
should
ever
recommend
disobedience
towards
a
parent
will
but
i
fear
you
have
yielded
too
much
to
yours
i
said
indeed
when
i
heard
it
that
i
feared
undue
influence
had
been
used
for
that
i
could
not
think
william
downe
wright
would
ever
have
been
the
choice
of
your
heart
surely
parents
have
much
to
answer
for
who
mislead
their
children
in
such
an
awful
step
as
marriage
this
was
the
severest
censure
mary
had
ever
heard
drop
from
lennox
lips
and
she
could
not
but
marvel
at
the
that
led
her
thus
to
condemn
in
another
the
very
error
she
had
committed
herself
but
under
such
different
circumstances
that
she
would
not
easily
have
admitted
it
to
be
the
same
she
sought
for
the
happiness
of
her
son
while
lady
juliana
she
was
convinced
wished
only
her
own
aggrandisement
yes
indeed
said
mary
in
answer
to
her
friend
observation
parents
ought
if
possible
to
avoid
even
forming
wishes
for
their
children
hearts
are
wayward
things
even
the
best
of
them
then
more
seriously
she
added
and
dear
lennox
do
not
either
blame
my
mother
nor
pity
me
for
be
assured
with
my
heart
only
will
i
give
my
hand
or
rather
i
should
say
with
my
hand
only
will
i
give
my
heart
and
now
cried
she
starting
up
and
hurrying
away
as
she
heard
colonel
lennox
voice
in
the
hall
she
met
him
on
the
stair
and
would
have
passed
on
with
a
slight
remark
but
he
turned
with
her
and
finding
she
had
dismissed
the
carriage
intending
to
walk
home
he
requested
permission
to
attend
her
mary
declined
but
snatching
up
his
hat
and
whistling
his
dogs
he
set
out
with
her
in
spite
of
her
remonstrances
to
the
contrary
if
you
persist
in
refusing
my
attendance
said
he
you
will
inflict
an
incurable
wound
upon
my
vanity
i
shall
suspect
you
are
ashamed
of
being
seen
in
such
company
to
be
sure
myself
with
my
shabby
jacket
and
my
spattered
dogs
do
form
rather
a
escort
and
i
should
not
have
dared
to
have
offered
my
services
to
a
fine
lady
but
you
are
not
a
fine
lady
i
know
and
he
gently
drew
her
arm
within
his
as
they
began
to
ascend
a
hill
this
was
the
first
time
mary
had
found
herself
alone
with
colonel
lennox
since
that
fatal
day
which
seemed
to
have
divided
them
for
ever
at
first
she
felt
uneasy
and
embarrassed
but
there
was
so
much
good
sense
and
good
feeling
in
the
tone
of
his
conversation
it
was
so
far
removed
either
from
pedantry
or
frivolity
that
all
disagreeable
ideas
soon
gave
way
to
the
pleasure
she
had
in
conversing
with
one
whose
turn
of
mind
seemed
so
similar
to
her
own
and
it
was
not
till
she
had
parted
from
him
at
the
gate
of
beech
park
she
had
time
to
wonder
how
she
could
possibly
have
walked
two
miles
with
a
man
whom
she
had
heard
solicited
to
love
her
from
that
day
colonel
lennox
visits
insensibly
increased
in
length
and
number
but
lady
emily
seemed
to
appropriate
them
entirely
to
herself
and
certainly
all
the
flow
of
his
conversation
the
brilliancy
of
his
wit
were
directed
to
her
but
mary
could
not
but
be
conscious
that
his
looks
were
much
oftener
riveted
on
herself
and
if
his
attentions
were
not
such
as
to
attract
general
observation
they
were
such
as
she
could
not
fail
of
perceiving
and
being
unconsciously
gratified
by
how
i
admire
charles
lennox
manner
to
you
mary
said
her
cousin
after
the
awkward
dilemma
you
were
both
in
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
know
how
to
proceed
a
man
would
either
have
oppressed
you
with
his
attentions
or
insulted
you
by
his
neglect
while
he
steers
so
gracefully
free
from
either
extreme
and
i
observe
you
are
the
only
woman
upon
whom
he
designs
to
bestow
petits
how
i
despise
a
man
who
is
ever
on
the
watch
to
pick
up
every
silly
miss
fan
or
glove
that
she
thinks
it
pretty
to
drop
no
the
woman
he
loves
whether
his
mother
or
his
wife
will
always
be
distinguished
by
him
were
she
amongst
queens
and
empresses
not
by
his
silly
vanity
or
vulgar
fondness
but
by
his
marked
and
gentlemanlike
attentions
towards
her
in
short
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
make
up
your
quarrel
with
him
take
him
for
all
in
all
you
wo
meet
with
such
another
certainly
not
amongst
your
highland
lairds
by
all
that
i
can
learn
and
i
do
suspect
he
is
now
as
you
say
trying
to
love
you
and
let
him
you
will
be
very
well
repaid
if
he
succeeds
mary
heart
swelled
at
the
thoughts
of
submitting
to
such
an
indignity
especially
as
she
was
beginning
to
feel
conscious
that
colonel
lennox
was
not
quite
the
object
of
indifference
to
her
that
he
ought
to
be
but
her
cousin
remarks
only
served
to
render
her
more
distant
and
reserved
to
him
than
ever
chapter

what
dangers
thou
not
to
dread
when
love
that
blind
is
by
blind
fortune
led
cowley
at
length
the
for
day
arrived
the
duke
of
proposals
were
made
in
due
form
and
in
due
form
accepted
lady
juliana
seemed
now
touching
the
pinnacle
of
earthly
joy
for
next
to
being
greatly
married
herself
her
happiness
centred
in
seeing
her
daughter
at
the
head
of
a
splendid
establishment
again
visions
of
bliss
hovered
around
her
and
peers
and
dukes
and
all
their
sweeping
train
swam
before
her
eyes
as
she
anticipated
the
brilliant
results
to
herself
from
so
noble
an
alliance
for
self
was
still
as
it
had
ever
been
her
ruling
star
and
her
affection
for
her
daughter
was
the
mere
result
of
vanity
and
ambition
the
ensuing
weeks
were
passed
in
all
the
bustle
of
preparations
necessarily
attendant
on
the
nuptials
of
the
great
every
morning
brought
from
town
dresses
jewels
patterns
and
packages
of
all
descriptions
lady
juliana
was
in
ecstasies
even
though
it
was
but
happiness
in
the
second
person
mary
watched
her
sister
looks
with
the
most
painful
solicitude
for
from
her
lips
she
knew
she
never
would
learn
the
sentiments
of
her
heart
but
adelaide
was
aware
she
had
a
part
to
act
and
she
went
through
it
with
an
ease
and
that
seemed
to
defy
all
scrutiny
once
or
twice
indeed
her
deepening
colour
and
darkening
brow
betrayed
the
feelings
of
her
heart
as
the
duke
of
altamont
and
lord
lindore
were
brought
into
comparison
and
mary
shuddered
to
think
that
her
sister
was
even
now
ashamed
of
the
man
whom
she
was
so
soon
to
vow
to
love
honour
and
obey
she
had
vainly
tried
to
lead
adelaide
to
the
subject
adelaide
would
listen
to
nothing
which
she
had
reason
to
suppose
was
addressed
to
herself
but
either
with
cool
contempt
took
up
a
book
or
left
the
room
or
with
insolent
affectation
would
put
her
hands
to
her
head
exclaiming
mes
oreilles
pas
faites
pour
les
entretiens
sérieux
all
mary
worst
fears
were
confirmed
a
few
days
before
that
fixed
for
the
marriage
as
she
entered
the
she
was
startled
to
find
lord
lindore
and
adelaide
alone
unwilling
to
suppose
that
her
presence
would
be
considered
as
an
interruption
she
seated
herself
at
a
little
distance
from
them
and
was
soon
engrossed
by
her
task
adelaide
too
had
the
air
of
being
deeply
intent
upon
some
trifling
employment
and
lord
lindore
as
he
sat
opposite
to
her
with
his
head
resting
upon
his
hands
had
the
appearance
of
being
engaged
in
reading
all
were
silent
for
some
time
but
as
mary
happened
to
look
up
she
saw
lord
fixed
earnestly
upon
her
sister
and
with
of
repressed
feeling
he
repeated
ah
je
le
sens
ma
julie
falloit
renoncer
a
vous
il
auroit
plus
pour
moi
sejour
ni
saison
and
throwing
down
the
book
he
quitted
the
room
adelaide
pale
and
agitated
rose
as
if
to
follow
him
then
recollecting
herself
she
rushed
from
the
apartment
by
an
opposite
door
mary
followed
vainly
hoping
that
in
this
moment
of
excited
feeling
she
might
be
induced
to
open
her
heart
to
the
voice
of
affection
but
adelaide
was
a
stranger
to
sympathy
and
saw
only
the
degradation
of
confessing
the
struggle
she
endured
in
choosing
betwixt
love
and
ambition
that
her
heart
was
lord
lindore
she
could
not
conceal
from
herself
though
she
would
not
confess
it
to
another
and
that
other
the
tenderest
of
sisters
whose
only
wish
was
to
serve
her
mary
tears
and
entreaties
were
therefore
in
vain
and
at
adelaide
repeated
desire
she
at
length
quitted
her
and
returned
to
the
room
she
had
left
she
found
lady
emily
there
with
a
paper
in
her
hand
lend
me
your
ears
mary
cried
she
while
i
read
these
lines
to
you
do
be
afraid
there
are
no
secrets
in
them
or
at
least
none
that
you
or
i
will
be
a
whit
the
wiser
for
as
they
are
truly
in
a
most
mystic
strain
i
found
them
lying
upon
this
table
and
they
are
in
frederick
handwriting
for
i
see
he
affects
the
at
present
and
it
seems
there
has
been
a
sort
of
a
sentimental
farce
acted
between
adelaide
and
him
he
pretends
that
although
distractedly
in
love
with
her
he
is
not
so
selfish
as
even
to
wish
her
to
marry
him
in
preference
to
the
duke
of
altamont
and
adelaide
not
to
be
outdone
in
heroics
has
also
made
it
out
that
it
is
the
height
of
virtue
in
her
to
espouse
the
duke
of
altamont
and
sacrifice
all
the
tenderest
affections
of
her
heart
to
duty
duty
yes
the
duty
of
being
a
duchess
and
of
living
in
state
and
splendour
with
the
man
she
secretly
despises
to
the
pleasure
of
renouncing
both
for
the
man
she
loves
and
so
they
have
parted
and
here
i
suppose
are
lindore
lucubrations
upon
it
intended
as
a
for
adelaide
i
presume
now
night
visions
befriend
me
the
time
returns
when
my
wilder
mind
a
thraldom
came
which
did
each
sense
enshroud
not
that
i
bowed
in
willing
chain
confined
but
that
a
soften
atmosphere
of
cloud
veiled
every
sense
conceal
th
impending
doom
was
mystic
night
and
i
seem
borne
along
by
pleasing
dread
and
in
a
doubtful
gloom
where
fragrant
incense
and
the
sound
of
song
and
all
fair
things
we
dream
of
floated
by
lulling
my
fancy
like
a
cradled
child
till
that
the
dear
and
guileless
treachery
made
me
the
wretch
i
am
so
lost
so
wild
a
mingled
feeling
neither
joy
or
grief
dwelt
in
my
heart
i
knew
not
whence
it
came
and
but
that
woe
is
me
was
passing
brief
even
at
this
hour
i
fain
would
feel
the
same
i
track
a
path
of
flowers
but
flowers
among
were
hissing
serpents
and
drear
birds
of
night
that
shot
across
and
scared
with
boding
cries
and
yet
deep
interest
lurked
in
that
affright
something
endearing
in
those
mysteries
which
bade
me
still
the
desperate
joy
pursue
heedless
of
what
might
come
when
from
mine
eyes
the
cloud
should
pass
or
what
might
then
accrue
the
cloud
passed
the
blissful
power
is
flown
the
flowers
are
wither
wither
all
the
scene
but
ah
the
dear
delusions
i
have
known
are
present
still
with
loved
though
altered
mien
i
tread
the
selfsame
path
in
heart
unchanged
but
changed
now
is
all
that
path
to
me
for
where
flowers
and
fountains
once
i
ranged
are
barren
rocks
and
savage
scenery
mary
felt
it
was
in
vain
to
attempt
to
win
her
sister
confidence
and
she
was
too
delicate
to
seek
to
wrest
her
secrets
from
her
she
therefore
took
no
notice
of
this
effusion
of
love
and
disappointment
which
she
concluded
it
to
be
adelaide
appeared
at
dinner
as
usual
all
traces
of
agitation
had
vanished
and
her
manner
was
a
cool
and
collected
as
if
all
had
been
peace
and
tranquillity
at
heart
lord
lindore
departure
was
slightly
noticed
it
was
generally
understood
that
he
had
been
rejected
by
his
cousin
and
his
absence
at
such
a
time
was
thought
perfectly
natural
the
duke
merely
remarking
with
a
vacant
simper
so
lord
lindore
is
gone
ah
poor
lord
lindore
lady
juliana
had
in
a
very
early
stage
of
the
business
fixed
in
her
own
mind
that
she
as
a
matter
of
course
would
be
invited
to
accompany
her
daughter
upon
her
marriage
indeed
she
had
always
looked
upon
it
as
a
sort
of
triple
alliance
that
was
to
unite
her
as
indissolubly
to
the
fortunes
of
the
duke
of
altamont
as
though
she
had
been
his
wedded
wife
but
the
time
drew
near
and
in
spite
of
all
her
hints
and
manoeuvres
no
invitation
had
yet
been
extorted
from
adelaide
the
duke
had
proposed
to
her
to
invite
her
sister
and
even
expressed
something
like
a
wish
to
that
effect
for
though
he
felt
no
positive
pleasure
in
mary
society
he
was
yet
conscious
of
a
void
in
her
absence
she
was
always
in
good
humour
always
gentle
and
polite
and
without
being
able
to
tell
why
his
grace
always
felt
more
at
ease
with
her
than
with
anybody
else
but
his
selfish
bride
seemed
to
think
that
the
joys
of
her
elevation
would
be
diminished
if
shared
even
by
her
own
sister
and
she
coldly
rejected
the
proposal
lady
juliana
was
next
suggested
for
the
duke
had
a
sort
of
vague
understanding
that
his
safety
lay
in
a
multitude
with
him
as
with
all
stupid
people
company
was
society
words
were
conversation
and
all
the
gradations
of
intellect
from
sir
isaac
newton
down
to
redgill
were
to
him
unknown
but
although
as
with
most
weak
people
obstinacy
was
his
he
was
here
again
compelled
to
yield
to
the
will
of
his
bride
as
she
also
declined
the
company
of
her
mother
for
the
present
the
disappointment
was
somewhat
softened
to
lady
juliana
by
the
sort
of
indefinite
hopes
that
were
expressed
by
her
daughter
of
seeing
her
in
town
when
they
were
fairly
established
but
until
she
had
seen
altamont
house
and
knew
its
accommodations
she
could
fix
nothing
and
lady
juliana
was
fain
to
solace
herself
with
this
dim
perspective
instead
of
the
brilliant
reality
her
imagination
had
placed
within
her
grasp
she
felt
too
without
comprehending
the
imperfectness
of
all
earthly
felicity
as
she
witnessed
the
magnificent
preparations
for
her
daughter
marriage
it
recalled
the
bitter
remembrance
of
her
own
and
many
a
sigh
burst
from
her
heart
as
he
thought
such
as
adelaide
is
i
might
have
been
had
i
been
blest
with
such
a
mother
and
brought
up
to
know
what
was
for
my
good
the
die
was
cast
amidst
pomp
and
magnificence
elate
with
pride
and
sparkling
with
jewels
adelaide
douglas
reversed
the
fate
of
her
mother
and
while
her
affections
were
bestowed
on
another
she
vowed
in
the
face
of
heaven
to
belong
only
to
the
duke
of
altamont
my
dearest
love
said
her
mother
as
she
embraced
her
with
transport
and
i
shall
be
with
you
very
soon
and
above
all
things
try
to
secure
a
good
for
the
season
i
assure
you
it
is
of
the
greatest
consequence
the
duchess
impatiently
hurried
from
the
congratulations
of
her
family
and
throwing
herself
into
the
splendid
equipage
that
awaited
her
was
soon
lost
to
their
view
chapter
xxii
every
white
will
have
its
black
and
every
sweet
its
sour
as
lady
juliana
experienced
her
daughter
was
duchess
of
altamont
but
grizzy
douglas
had
arrived
in
bath
the
intelligence
was
communicated
to
mary
in
a
letter
it
had
no
date
but
was
as
follows
my
dear
mary
you
will
see
from
the
date
of
this
that
we
are
at
last
arrived
here
after
a
very
long
journey
which
you
of
course
know
it
is
from
this
to
our
part
of
the
country
at
the
same
time
it
was
uncommonly
pleasant
and
we
all
enjoyed
it
very
much
only
poor
sir
sampson
was
so
ill
that
we
expected
him
to
expire
every
minute
which
would
have
made
it
extremely
unpleasant
for
dear
lady
he
is
now
i
am
happy
to
say
greatly
better
though
still
so
poorly
that
i
am
much
afraid
you
will
see
a
very
considerable
change
upon
him
i
sincerely
hope
my
dear
mary
that
you
will
make
a
proper
apology
to
lady
juliana
for
my
not
going
to
beech
park
where
i
know
i
would
be
made
most
welcome
directly
but
i
am
certain
she
will
agree
with
me
that
it
would
be
highly
improper
in
me
to
leave
lady
when
she
is
not
at
all
sure
how
long
sir
sampson
may
live
and
it
would
appear
very
odd
if
i
was
to
be
out
of
the
way
at
such
a
time
as
that
but
you
may
assure
her
with
my
kind
love
and
indeed
all
our
loves
as
i
am
sure
none
of
us
can
ever
forget
the
pleasant
time
she
spent
with
us
at
glenfern
in
my
poor
brother
lifetime
before
you
was
born
that
i
will
take
the
very
first
opportunity
of
spending
some
time
at
beech
park
before
leaving
bath
as
we
expect
the
waters
will
set
sir
sampson
quite
on
his
feet
again
it
will
be
a
happy
meeting
i
am
certain
with
lady
juliana
and
all
of
us
as
it
is
eighteen
years
this
spring
since
we
have
met
you
may
be
sure
i
have
a
great
deal
to
tell
you
and
lady
juliana
too
about
all
friends
at
glenfern
whom
i
left
all
quite
well
of
course
the
report
of
bella
and
betsy
marriages
must
have
reached
bath
by
this
time
as
it
will
be
three
weeks
since
we
left
our
part
of
the
country
but
in
case
it
has
not
reached
you
lady
is
of
opinion
that
the
sooner
you
are
made
acquainted
with
it
the
better
especially
as
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
bella
marriage
which
is
in
a
manner
fixed
by
this
time
i
daresay
though
of
course
it
will
not
take
place
for
some
time
is
to
capt
of
some
regiment
but
i
sure
i
forget
which
for
there
are
so
many
regiments
you
know
it
is
impossible
to
remember
them
all
but
he
is
quite
a
hero
i
know
that
as
he
has
been
in
several
battles
and
had
two
of
his
front
teeth
knocked
out
at
one
of
them
and
was
much
complimented
about
it
and
he
says
he
is
quite
certain
of
getting
great
promotion
at
any
rate
a
pension
for
it
so
there
is
no
fear
of
him
betsy
has
if
possible
been
still
more
fortunate
than
her
sister
although
you
know
bella
was
always
reckoned
the
beauty
of
the
family
though
some
people
certainly
preferred
betsy
looks
too
she
has
made
a
complete
conquest
of
major
of
the
militia
who
independent
of
his
rank
which
is
certainly
very
high
has
also
distinguished
himself
very
much
and
showed
the
greatest
bravery
once
when
there
was
a
very
serious
riot
about
the
raising
the
potatoes
a
penny
a
peck
when
there
was
no
occasion
for
it
in
the
town
of
dunoon
and
it
was
very
much
talked
of
at
the
time
as
well
as
being
in
all
the
newspapers
this
gives
us
all
the
greatest
pleasure
as
i
am
certain
it
will
also
do
lady
juliana
and
you
my
dear
mary
at
the
same
time
we
feel
very
much
for
poor
babby
and
beenie
and
becky
as
they
naturally
and
indeed
all
of
us
expected
they
would
of
course
be
married
first
and
it
is
certainly
a
great
trial
for
them
to
see
their
younger
sisters
married
before
them
at
the
same
time
they
are
wonderfully
supported
and
behave
with
astonishing
firmness
and
i
trust
my
dear
mary
you
will
do
the
same
as
i
have
no
doubt
you
will
all
be
married
yet
as
i
am
sure
you
richly
deserve
it
when
it
comes
i
hope
i
will
see
you
very
soon
as
lady
i
am
certain
will
make
you
most
welcome
to
call
we
are
living
in
most
elegant
lodgings
all
the
furniture
is
quite
new
and
perfectly
good
i
do
not
know
the
name
of
the
street
yet
as
lady
which
is
no
wonder
is
not
fond
of
being
asked
questions
when
she
is
upon
a
journey
and
indeed
makes
a
point
of
never
answering
any
which
i
daresay
is
the
best
way
but
of
course
anybody
will
tell
you
where
sir
sampson
maclaughlan
baronet
of
lochmarliie
castle
perthshire
lives
and
if
you
are
at
any
loss
it
has
a
green
door
and
a
most
elegant
balcony
i
must
now
bid
you
adieu
my
dear
mary
as
i
am
so
soon
to
see
yourself
sir
sampson
and
lady
unite
with
me
in
best
compliments
to
the
family
at
beech
park
and
in
kind
love
to
lady
juliana
and
you
i
remain
my
dear
mary
your
most
affectionate
aunt
grizzel
douglas
i
have
a
long
letter
for
you
from
douglas
which
is
in
my
trunk
that
is
coming
by
the
perth
carrier
and
unless
he
is
stopped
by
the
snow
i
expect
he
will
be
here
in
ten
days
with
the
idea
of
grizzy
was
associated
in
mary
mind
all
the
dear
familiar
objects
of
her
happiest
days
and
her
eyes
sparkled
with
delight
at
the
thoughts
of
again
beholding
her
oh
when
may
i
go
to
bath
to
dear
aunt
grizzy
exclaimed
she
as
she
finished
the
letter
lady
juliana
looked
petrified
then
recollecting
that
this
was
the
first
intimation
her
mother
had
received
of
such
an
event
being
even
in
contemplation
she
made
haste
to
exculpate
her
aunt
at
her
own
expense
by
informing
her
of
the
truth
but
nothing
could
be
more
unpalatable
than
the
truth
and
poor
joy
was
soon
turned
into
the
bitterest
sorrow
at
the
reproaches
that
were
showered
upon
her
by
the
incensed
lady
juliana
but
for
her
these
people
never
would
have
thought
of
coming
to
bath
or
if
they
did
she
should
have
had
no
connection
with
them
she
had
been
most
excessively
by
douglas
family
and
had
long
since
resolved
to
have
no
further
intercourse
with
them
they
were
nothing
to
her
etc
etc
the
whole
concluding
with
a
positive
prohibition
against
mary
taking
any
notice
of
her
aunt
from
all
that
has
been
said
mary
said
lady
emily
gravely
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
you
are
the
origin
of
lady
juliana
unfortunate
connection
with
the
family
of
douglas
undoubtedly
said
her
ladyship
but
for
you
it
appears
that
she
would
not
have
known
certainly
never
would
have
acknowledged
that
her
husband
had
an
aunt
certainly
not
said
lady
juliana
warmly
it
is
a
most
admirable
plan
continued
lady
emily
in
the
same
manner
and
i
shall
certainly
adopt
it
when
i
have
children
i
am
determined
they
shall
be
answerable
for
my
making
a
foolish
marriage
and
it
shall
be
their
fault
if
my
husband
has
a
mother
attendant
i
am
determined
to
patronise
edward
relations
to
the
last
degree
and
therefore
unless
mary
is
permitted
to
visit
her
aunt
as
often
as
she
pleases
i
shall
make
a
point
of
bringing
the
dear
aunt
grizzy
here
yes
putting
her
hand
to
the
bell
i
shall
order
my
carriage
this
instant
and
set
off
you
know
we
give
a
grand
dinner
in
honour
of
adelaide
marriage
aunt
grizzy
shall
be
queen
of
the
feast
lady
juliana
was
almost
suffocated
with
passion
but
she
knew
her
niece
too
well
to
doubt
her
putting
her
threat
into
execution
and
there
was
distraction
in
the
idea
of
the
vulgar
obscure
grizzy
douglas
being
presented
to
a
fashionable
party
as
her
aunt
after
a
violent
altercation
in
which
mary
took
no
part
an
ungracious
permission
was
at
length
extorted
which
mary
eagerly
availed
herself
of
and
charged
with
kind
messages
from
lady
emily
set
off
in
quest
of
aunt
grizzy
and
the
green
door
after
much
trouble
and
many
unsuccessful
attacks
upon
green
doors
and
balconies
she
was
going
to
give
up
the
search
in
despair
when
her
eye
was
attracted
by
the
figure
of
aunt
grizzy
herself
at
full
length
stationed
at
a
window
in
an
and
spectacles
the
carriage
was
stopped
and
in
an
instant
mary
was
in
the
arms
of
her
aunt
all
agitation
as
lochmarlie
flashed
on
her
fancy
at
again
hearing
its
native
accents
uttered
by
the
voice
familiar
to
her
from
infancy
yet
the
truth
must
be
owned
mary
taste
was
somewhat
startled
even
while
her
heart
warmed
at
the
sight
of
the
good
old
aunt
association
and
affection
still
retained
their
magical
influence
over
her
but
absence
had
dispelled
the
blest
illusions
of
habitual
intercourse
and
for
the
first
time
she
beheld
her
aunt
freed
from
its
softening
spell
still
her
heart
clung
to
her
as
to
one
known
and
loved
from
infancy
and
she
soon
rose
superior
to
the
weakness
she
felt
was
besetting
her
in
the
slight
sensation
of
shame
as
she
contrasted
her
awkward
manner
and
uncouth
accent
with
the
graceful
refinement
of
those
with
whom
she
associated
far
different
were
the
sensations
with
which
the
good
spinster
regarded
her
niece
she
could
not
often
enough
declare
her
admiration
of
the
improvements
that
had
taken
place
mary
was
grown
taller
and
stouter
and
fairer
and
fatter
and
her
back
was
a
straight
as
an
arrow
and
her
carriage
would
even
surprise
miss
herself
it
was
quite
astonishing
to
see
her
for
she
had
always
understood
scotland
was
the
place
for
beauty
and
that
nobody
ever
came
to
anything
in
england
even
sir
sampson
and
lady
maclaughlan
were
forgot
as
she
stood
riveted
in
admiration
and
mary
was
the
first
to
recall
her
recollection
to
them
sir
sampson
indeed
might
well
have
been
overlooked
by
a
more
accurate
observer
for
as
grizzy
observed
he
was
worn
away
to
nothing
and
the
little
that
remained
seemed
as
if
it
might
have
gone
too
without
being
any
loss
he
was
now
deaf
paralytic
and
childish
and
the
only
symptom
of
life
he
showed
was
an
increased
restlessness
and
peevishness
his
lady
sat
by
him
calmly
pursuing
her
work
and
without
relaxing
from
it
merely
held
up
her
face
to
salute
mary
as
she
approached
her
so
i
glad
you
are
no
worse
than
you
was
dear
child
surveying
her
from
head
to
foot
that
more
than
can
say
you
see
these
poor
creatures
pointing
to
sir
sampson
and
aunt
grizzy
they
are
much
about
it
now
well
we
know
what
we
are
but
god
knows
what
we
shall
be
humph
sir
sampson
showed
no
signs
of
recognising
her
but
seemed
pleased
when
grizzy
resumed
her
station
beside
him
and
began
for
the
five
hundredth
time
to
tell
him
why
he
was
not
in
lochmarlie
castle
and
why
he
was
in
bath
mary
now
saw
that
there
are
situations
in
which
a
weak
capacity
has
its
uses
and
that
the
most
foolish
chat
may
sometimes
impart
greater
pleasure
than
all
the
wisdom
of
the
schools
even
when
proceeding
from
a
benevolent
heart
sir
sampson
and
grizzy
were
so
much
upon
a
pair
in
intellect
that
they
were
reciprocally
happy
in
each
other
this
the
strong
sense
of
lady
maclaughlan
had
long
perceived
and
was
the
principal
reason
of
her
selecting
so
weak
a
woman
as
her
companion
though
at
the
same
time
in
justice
to
her
ladyship
heart
as
well
as
head
she
had
that
partiality
for
her
friend
for
which
no
other
reason
can
be
assigned
than
that
given
by
montaigne
je
parceque
parceque
moi
mary
paid
a
long
visit
to
her
aunt
and
then
took
leave
promising
to
return
the
following
day
to
take
miss
grizzy
to
deliver
a
letter
of
introduction
she
had
received
and
which
had
not
been
left
to
the
chance
of
the
carrier
and
the
snow
chapter
xxiii
this
sort
of
person
is
skilled
to
assume
the
appearance
of
all
virtues
and
all
good
qualities
but
their
favourite
mask
is
universal
benevolence
and
the
reason
why
they
prefer
this
disguise
to
all
others
is
that
it
tends
to
conceal
its
opposite
which
is
indeed
their
true
character
an
universal
selfishness
knox
although
on
her
return
mary
read
her
mother
displeasure
in
her
looks
and
was
grieved
at
again
having
incurred
it
she
yet
felt
it
a
duty
towards
her
father
to
persevere
in
her
attentions
to
his
aunt
she
was
old
poor
and
unknown
plain
in
her
person
weak
in
her
intellects
vulgar
in
her
manners
but
she
was
related
to
her
by
ties
more
binding
than
the
laws
of
fashion
or
the
rules
of
taste
even
these
disadvantages
which
to
a
worldly
mind
would
have
served
as
excuses
for
neglecting
her
to
mary
generous
nature
were
so
many
incentives
to
treat
her
with
kindness
and
attention
faithful
to
her
promise
therefore
she
repaired
to
milsom
street
and
found
her
aunt
all
impatience
for
her
arrival
with
the
letter
so
firmly
grasped
in
both
hands
that
she
seemed
almost
afraid
to
trust
anyone
with
a
glance
at
the
direction
this
letter
mary
said
she
when
they
were
seated
in
the
carriage
will
be
a
great
thing
for
me
and
especially
for
you
i
got
it
from
menzies
through
whose
friend
miss
grant
is
a
great
friend
of
fox
and
she
says
she
is
a
most
charming
woman
of
course
she
is
no
friend
to
the
great
fox
or
you
know
it
would
have
been
very
odd
in
me
with
sir
principles
and
my
poor
brother
principles
and
all
our
own
principles
to
have
visited
her
but
she
quite
of
a
different
family
of
foxes
she
a
fox
of
peckwell
it
seems
a
most
amiable
woman
very
rich
and
prodigiously
charitable
i
am
sure
we
have
been
most
fortunate
in
getting
a
letter
to
such
a
woman
and
with
this
heartfelt
ejaculation
they
found
themselves
at
fox
everything
corresponded
with
the
account
of
this
lady
wealth
and
consequence
the
house
was
spacious
and
handsomely
furnished
with
its
due
proportion
of
livery
servants
and
they
were
ushered
into
a
which
was
filled
with
all
the
of
nature
and
art
indian
shells
inlaid
cabinets
ivory
boxes
stuffed
birds
old
china
chinese
mandarins
stood
disclosed
in
all
their
charms
the
lady
of
this
mansion
was
seated
at
table
covered
with
works
of
a
different
description
it
exhibited
the
various
arts
of
woman
in
regular
gradation
from
the
painted
and
gilded
firescreen
to
the
humble
and
fox
was
a
fine
woman
with
a
smooth
skin
and
still
smoother
address
she
received
her
visitors
with
that
overstrained
complaisance
which
to
mary
nicer
tact
at
once
discovered
that
all
was
hollow
but
poor
miss
grizzy
was
scarcely
seated
before
she
was
already
transfixed
with
admiration
at
fox
politeness
and
felt
as
if
her
whole
life
would
be
too
short
to
repay
such
kindness
compliments
over
the
weather
discussed
fox
began
you
must
be
surprised
ladies
to
see
me
in
the
midst
of
such
a
litter
but
you
find
me
busy
arranging
the
works
of
some
poor
of
mine
a
most
unfortunate
family
i
have
given
them
what
little
instruction
i
could
in
these
little
female
works
and
you
see
putting
a
gaudy
into
grizzy
hands
it
is
astonishing
what
progress
they
have
made
my
friends
have
been
most
liberal
in
their
purchases
of
these
trifles
but
i
own
i
am
a
wretched
beggar
they
are
in
bad
hands
when
they
are
in
mine
poor
souls
the
fact
is
i
can
give
but
i
can
not
beg
i
tell
them
they
really
must
find
somebody
else
to
dispose
of
their
little
labours
somebody
who
has
more
of
what
i
call
the
gift
of
begging
than
i
am
blest
with
tears
of
admiration
stood
in
grizzy
eye
her
hand
was
in
her
pocket
she
looked
to
mary
but
mary
hands
and
eyes
betrayed
no
corresponding
emotions
she
felt
only
disgust
at
the
meanness
and
indelicacy
of
the
mistress
of
such
a
mansion
levying
contributions
from
the
stranger
within
her
door
fox
proceeded
that
most
benevolent
woman
miss
gull
was
here
this
morning
and
bought
no
less
than
seven
of
these
sweet
little
pincushions
i
would
fain
have
dissuaded
her
from
taking
so
many
it
really
seemed
such
a
stretch
of
virtue
but
she
said
dear
fox
how
can
one
possibly
spend
their
money
better
than
in
doing
a
good
action
and
at
the
same
time
enriching
themselves
grizzy
purse
was
in
her
hand
i
declare
that
very
true
i
never
thought
of
that
before
and
i
certain
lady
maclaughlan
will
say
the
very
same
and
i
sure
she
will
be
delighted
i
no
doubt
of
that
to
take
a
pincushion
and
each
of
my
sisters
i
certain
will
take
one
though
we
have
all
plenty
of
pincushions
and
i
take
one
to
myself
though
i
have
three
i
sure
that
i
never
used
yet
my
dear
miss
douglas
you
really
are
i
could
almost
say
good
two
and
two
four
and
one
five
five
my
poor
you
will
really
be
the
making
of
their
fortune
grizzy
with
trembling
hands
and
a
face
flushed
with
conscious
virtue
drew
forth
the
money
from
her
little
hoard
but
fox
did
not
quit
her
prey
so
easily
if
any
of
your
friends
are
in
want
of
miss
douglas
i
would
fain
recommend
those
to
them
they
are
made
by
a
poor
woman
in
whom
i
take
some
interest
and
are
far
superior
to
any
that
are
to
be
had
from
the
shops
they
are
made
from
the
very
best
materials
indeed
i
take
care
of
that
as
in
a
modest
whisper
i
furnish
her
with
the
material
myself
but
the
generality
of
those
you
get
to
purchase
are
made
from
old
materials
i
ascertained
that
and
it
a
fact
you
may
rely
upon
poor
grizzy
hair
stood
on
end
to
hear
of
such
depravity
in
a
sphere
where
she
had
never
even
suspected
it
but
for
the
honour
of
her
country
she
flattered
herself
such
practices
were
there
unknown
and
she
was
entering
upon
a
warm
vindication
of
the
integrity
of
scotch
when
fox
coolly
observed
indeed
our
friend
miss
grant
was
so
conscious
of
the
great
superiority
of
these
buttons
over
any
others
that
she
bespoke
dozen
of
them
to
take
to
scotland
with
her
in
fact
they
are
the
real
good
such
as
i
have
heard
my
mother
talk
of
and
for
all
that
i
make
a
point
of
my
poor
woman
selling
them
a
penny
a
dozen
below
the
shop
price
so
that
in
taking
twelve
dozen
which
is
the
common
quantity
there
is
a
shilling
saved
at
once
grizzy
felt
as
if
she
would
be
the
saving
of
the
family
by
the
purchase
of
these
incomparable
shirt
buttons
and
putting
down
her
five
shillings
became
the
happy
possessor
of
twelve
dozen
of
them
fresh
expressions
of
gratitude
and
admiration
ensued
till
brain
began
to
whirl
even
more
rapidly
than
usual
at
the
thought
of
the
deeds
she
had
done
and
now
said
fox
observing
her
eyes
in
a
fine
frenzy
rolling
from
her
lapful
of
pincushions
and
shirt
buttons
to
a
mandarin
nearly
as
large
as
life
perhaps
my
dear
miss
douglas
you
will
do
me
the
favour
to
take
a
look
of
my
little
collection
favour
thought
grizzy
what
politeness
and
she
protested
there
was
nothing
she
liked
so
much
as
to
look
at
everything
and
that
it
would
be
the
greatest
favour
to
show
her
anything
the
mandarin
was
made
to
shake
his
head
a
musical
snuffbox
played
its
part
and
a
variety
of
other
expensive
toys
were
also
exhibited
mary
disgust
increased
and
this
woman
thought
she
professes
to
be
charitable
amidst
all
this
display
of
selfish
extravagance
probably
the
price
of
one
of
these
costly
baubles
would
have
provided
for
the
whole
of
these
poor
people
for
whom
she
affects
so
much
compassion
without
subjecting
her
to
the
meanness
of
turning
her
house
into
a
beggar
repository
and
she
walked
away
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
to
examine
some
fine
scriptural
paintings
here
said
fox
to
her
victim
as
she
unlocked
a
superb
cabinet
is
what
i
value
more
than
my
whole
collection
put
together
it
is
my
specimens
of
scotch
pebbles
and
i
owe
them
solely
to
the
generosity
and
of
my
scotch
friends
i
assure
you
that
is
a
proud
reflection
to
me
i
am
a
perfect
enthusiast
in
scotch
pebbles
and
i
may
say
in
scotch
people
in
fact
i
am
an
enthusiast
in
whatever
i
am
interested
in
and
at
present
i
must
own
my
heart
is
set
upon
making
a
complete
collection
of
scotch
pebbles
grizzy
began
to
feel
a
sort
of
tightness
at
her
throat
at
which
was
affixed
a
very
fine
pebble
brooch
pertaining
to
nicky
but
lent
to
grizzy
to
enable
her
to
make
a
more
distinguished
figure
in
the
gay
world
oh
thought
she
what
a
pity
this
brooch
is
nicky
and
not
mine
i
would
have
given
it
to
this
charming
fox
indeed
i
do
see
how
i
can
be
off
giving
it
to
her
even
although
it
is
nicky
and
exclaimed
fox
as
if
suddenly
struck
with
the
sight
of
the
brooch
that
seems
a
very
fine
stone
of
yours
i
wonder
i
did
not
observe
it
sooner
but
indeed
pebbles
are
thrown
away
in
dress
may
i
beg
a
nearer
view
of
it
grizzy
brain
was
now
all
on
fire
on
the
one
hand
there
was
the
glory
of
presenting
the
brooch
to
such
a
polite
charitable
charming
woman
on
the
other
there
was
the
fear
of
nicky
indignation
but
then
it
was
quite
thrown
away
upon
nicky
she
had
no
cabinet
and
fox
had
declared
that
pebbles
were
quite
lost
anywhere
but
in
cabinets
and
it
was
a
thousand
pities
that
nicky
brooch
should
be
lost
all
these
thoughts
grizzy
revolved
with
her
usual
clearness
as
she
unclasped
the
brooch
and
gave
it
into
the
hand
of
the
collector
bless
me
my
dear
miss
douglas
this
is
really
a
very
fine
stone
i
had
no
conception
of
it
when
i
saw
it
sticking
in
your
throat
it
looks
quite
a
different
thing
in
the
hand
it
is
a
species
i
am
really
not
acquainted
with
i
have
nothing
at
all
similar
to
it
in
my
poor
collection
pray
can
you
tell
me
the
name
of
it
and
where
it
is
found
that
i
may
at
least
endeavour
to
procure
a
piece
of
it
i
sure
i
wish
to
goodness
my
sister
nicky
was
here
i
certain
she
would
though
to
be
sure
she
has
a
great
regard
for
it
for
it
was
found
on
the
glenfern
estate
the
very
day
my
grandfather
won
his
plea
against
drimsydie
and
we
always
called
it
the
lucky
stone
from
that
the
lucky
stone
what
a
delightful
name
i
shall
never
think
myself
in
luck
till
i
can
procure
a
piece
of
your
lucky
stone
i
protest
i
could
almost
go
to
scotland
on
purpose
oh
you
dear
lucky
stone
kissing
it
with
rapture
i
sure
i
almost
certain
indeed
i
convinced
if
my
sister
nicky
was
here
she
would
be
delighted
to
offer
it
would
certainly
be
doing
my
sister
nicky
the
greatest
favour
since
you
think
it
would
be
seen
to
so
much
greater
advantage
in
your
cabinet
which
for
my
own
part
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
of
as
certainly
my
sister
nicky
very
seldom
wears
it
for
fear
of
losing
it
and
it
would
be
a
thousand
pities
if
it
was
lost
and
to
be
sure
it
will
be
much
safer
locked
up
nobody
can
dispute
that
so
i
am
sure
it
by
far
the
best
thing
my
sister
nicky
can
do
for
certainly
a
pebble
brooch
is
quite
lost
as
a
brooch
my
dear
miss
douglas
i
am
really
quite
ashamed
this
is
a
perfect
robbery
i
protest
but
i
must
insist
upon
your
accepting
some
little
token
of
my
regard
for
miss
nicky
in
return
going
to
her
and
returning
with
a
set
of
painted
i
must
request
the
favour
of
you
to
present
these
to
miss
nicky
with
my
kind
regards
and
assure
her
i
shall
consider
her
lucky
stone
as
the
most
precious
jewel
in
my
possession
the
whole
of
this
scene
had
been
performed
with
such
rapidity
that
poor
grizzy
was
not
prepared
for
the
sudden
metamorphose
of
nicky
pebble
brooch
into
a
set
of
painted
and
some
vague
alarms
began
to
float
through
her
brain
mary
now
advanced
quite
unconscious
of
what
had
been
going
on
and
having
whispered
her
aunt
to
take
leave
they
departed
they
returned
in
silence
grizzy
was
so
occupied
in
examining
her
pincushions
and
counting
her
buttons
that
she
never
looked
up
till
the
carriage
stopped
in
milsom
street
mary
accompanied
her
in
grizzy
was
all
impatience
to
display
her
treasures
and
as
she
hastily
unfolded
them
began
to
relate
her
achievements
lady
maclaughlan
heard
her
in
silence
and
a
deep
groan
was
all
that
she
uttered
but
grizzy
was
too
well
accustomed
to
be
groaned
at
to
be
at
all
appalled
and
went
on
but
all
that
nothing
to
the
made
of
fox
own
linen
and
only
five
shillings
the
twelve
dozen
and
considering
what
tricks
are
played
with
now
i
assure
you
people
require
to
be
on
their
guard
with
now
pray
my
dear
did
you
ever
read
the
of
wakefield
the
of
wakefield
i
i
think
always
i
must
have
read
it
at
any
rate
i
certain
i
heard
of
it
moses
and
his
green
spectacles
was
as
one
of
the
acts
of
solomon
compared
to
you
and
your
shirtbuttons
pray
which
of
you
is
it
that
wears
shirts
i
declare
that
very
true
i
wonder
i
did
not
think
of
that
sooner
to
be
sure
none
us
wear
shirts
since
my
poor
brother
died
and
what
become
of
her
brooch
turning
to
mary
who
for
the
first
time
observed
the
departure
of
nicky
crown
jewel
oh
as
to
the
brooch
cried
grizzy
i
certain
you
all
think
that
well
bestowed
and
certainly
it
has
been
the
saving
of
it
upon
which
she
commenced
a
most
entangled
narrative
from
which
the
truth
was
at
length
extracted
well
said
lady
maclaughlan
there
are
two
things
god
grant
i
may
never
become
an
in
charity
and
a
collector
of
curiosities
no
christian
can
be
either
both
are
pickpockets
i
would
keep
company
with
my
own
mother
were
she
either
one
or
other
humph
mary
was
grieved
at
the
loss
of
the
brooch
but
grizzy
seemed
more
than
ever
satisfied
with
the
exchange
as
sir
sampson
had
taken
a
fancy
for
the
and
it
would
amuse
him
for
the
rest
of
the
day
to
be
told
every
two
minutes
what
they
were
intended
for
mary
therefore
left
her
quite
happy
and
returned
to
beech
park
chapter
xxiv
he
either
fears
his
fate
too
much
or
his
deserts
are
small
who
dares
not
put
it
to
the
touch
to
gain
or
lose
it
all
of
time
rolled
on
but
no
event
occurred
in
grizzy
life
worthy
of
being
commemorated
lady
juliana
began
to
recover
from
the
shock
of
her
arrival
and
at
length
was
even
prevailed
upon
to
pay
her
a
visit
and
actually
spent
five
minutes
in
the
same
room
with
her
all
her
ladyship
plans
seemed
now
on
the
point
of
being
accomplished
downe
wright
was
now
lord
glenallan
with
an
additional
fifteen
thousand
per
annum
and
by
wiser
heads
than
hers
would
have
been
thought
an
unexceptionable
match
for
any
young
woman
leaving
his
mother
to
settle
his
affairs
in
scotland
to
which
she
was
much
more
than
himself
he
hastened
to
beech
park
to
claim
mary
promised
hand
but
neither
wealth
nor
grandeur
possessed
any
sway
over
mind
and
she
turned
from
that
species
of
happiness
which
she
felt
would
be
insufficient
to
satisfy
the
best
affections
of
her
heart
no
thought
she
it
is
not
in
splendour
and
distinction
that
i
shall
find
happiness
it
is
in
the
cultivation
of
the
domestic
virtues
the
peaceful
joys
of
a
happy
home
and
a
loved
companion
that
my
felicity
must
consist
without
these
i
feel
that
i
should
still
be
poor
were
i
mistress
of
millions
and
she
took
the
first
opportunity
of
acquainting
lord
glenallan
with
the
nature
of
her
sentiments
he
received
the
communication
with
painful
surprise
but
as
he
was
one
of
those
who
do
not
easily
divest
themselves
of
an
idea
that
has
once
taken
possession
of
their
brain
he
seemed
resolved
to
persevere
in
his
quiet
though
pointed
attentions
lady
juliana
anger
at
the
discovery
of
her
daughter
refusal
it
is
needless
to
describe
it
may
easily
be
imagined
and
poor
mary
was
almost
heartbroken
by
the
violence
and
duration
of
it
sometimes
she
wavered
in
her
ideas
as
to
whether
she
was
doing
right
in
thus
resisting
her
mother
wishes
and
in
the
utmost
distress
she
mentioned
her
scruples
to
lady
emily
as
to
lady
juliana
wishes
said
her
cousin
they
are
mere
but
as
to
your
own
views
why
really
you
are
somewhat
of
a
riddle
to
me
i
rather
think
were
i
such
a
quiet
civil
person
as
you
i
could
have
married
lord
glenallan
well
enough
he
is
handsome
and
rich
and
though
is
but
a
lord
and
nothing
but
a
lord
still
there
is
a
dash
and
bustle
in
twenty
thousand
a
year
that
takes
off
from
the
ennui
of
a
dull
companion
with
five
hundred
a
year
i
grant
you
he
would
be
execrable
then
i
shall
never
marry
a
man
with
twenty
thousand
a
year
whom
i
would
not
have
with
five
hundred
in
short
you
are
to
marry
for
love
that
the
old
story
which
with
all
your
wisdom
you
wise
girls
always
end
in
where
shall
i
find
a
hero
upon
five
hundred
a
year
for
you
of
course
he
must
be
virtuous
noble
dignified
handsome
brave
witty
what
would
you
think
of
charles
lennox
mary
coloured
after
what
passed
i
would
not
marry
colonel
lennox
no
affecting
to
smile
not
if
he
were
to
ask
me
which
is
certainly
the
most
unlikely
of
all
things
ah
true
i
had
forgot
that
scrape
no
that
wo
do
it
certainly
would
be
most
pitiful
in
you
after
what
passed
well
i
do
know
what
to
be
done
with
you
there
nothing
for
it
but
that
you
should
take
lord
glenallan
with
all
his
imperfections
on
his
head
and
after
all
i
really
see
nothing
that
he
wants
but
a
little
more
brain
and
as
you
have
the
managing
of
him
you
can
easily
supply
that
deficiency
indeed
answered
mary
i
find
i
have
quite
little
enough
for
myself
and
i
have
no
genius
whatever
for
managing
i
shall
therefore
never
marry
unless
i
marry
a
man
on
whose
judgment
i
could
rely
for
advice
and
assistance
and
for
whom
i
could
feel
a
certain
deference
that
i
consider
due
from
a
wife
to
her
husband
i
see
what
you
would
be
at
said
lady
emily
you
mean
to
model
yourself
upon
the
behaviour
of
tooley
who
has
such
a
deference
for
the
judgment
of
her
better
half
that
she
consults
him
even
about
the
tying
of
her
shoes
and
would
not
presume
to
give
her
child
a
few
grains
of
magnesia
without
this
full
and
unqualified
approbation
now
i
flatter
myself
my
husband
and
i
shall
have
a
more
equitable
division
for
though
man
is
a
reasonable
being
he
shall
know
and
own
that
woman
is
so
too
sometimes
all
things
that
men
ought
to
know
better
i
shall
yield
whatever
may
belong
to
either
sex
i
either
seize
upon
as
my
prerogative
or
scrupulously
divide
for
which
reason
i
should
like
the
profession
of
my
husband
to
be
something
in
which
i
could
not
possibly
interfere
how
difficult
must
it
be
for
a
woman
in
the
lower
ranks
of
life
to
avoid
teaching
her
husband
how
to
sew
if
he
is
a
tailor
or
how
to
bake
if
he
is
a
baker
etc
nature
seems
to
have
provided
for
this
tendency
of
both
sexes
by
making
your
sensible
men
that
is
men
who
think
themselves
sensible
and
wish
everybody
else
to
think
the
same
incline
to
foolish
women
i
can
detect
one
of
these
sensible
husbands
at
a
glance
by
the
pomp
and
formality
visible
in
every
word
look
or
action
men
in
short
whose
do
cream
and
mantle
like
a
standing
pond
who
are
perfect
joves
in
their
own
houses
who
speak
their
will
by
a
nod
and
lay
down
the
law
by
the
motion
of
their
eyebrow
and
who
attach
prodigious
ideas
of
dignity
to
frightening
their
children
and
being
worshipped
by
their
wives
till
you
see
one
of
these
wiseacres
looking
as
if
he
thought
himself
and
his
obsequious
helpmate
were
exact
personifications
of
adam
and
eve
he
for
god
only
she
for
god
in
him
now
i
am
much
afraid
mary
with
all
your
sanctity
you
are
in
some
danger
of
becoming
one
of
these
idolatresses
i
hope
not
replied
mary
laughing
but
if
i
should
that
seems
scarcely
so
bad
as
the
sect
of
independents
in
the
marriage
state
for
example
there
is
boston
who
by
all
strangers
is
taken
for
a
widow
such
emphasis
does
she
lay
upon
the
personal
pronoun
with
her
always
do
this
or
do
that
without
the
slightest
reference
to
her
husband
and
she
talks
of
house
gardens
carriage
children
as
if
there
were
no
copartnery
in
the
case
ah
she
is
very
odious
cried
lady
emily
she
is
both
master
and
mistress
and
more
if
possible
she
makes
her
husband
look
like
her
footman
but
she
is
a
fool
as
every
woman
must
needs
be
who
thinks
she
can
raise
herself
by
lowering
her
husband
then
there
is
the
sect
of
the
wranglers
whose
marriage
is
only
one
continued
dispute
but
in
short
i
see
it
is
reserved
for
me
to
set
a
perfect
example
to
my
sex
in
the
married
state
but
i
more
reasonable
than
you
i
suspect
for
i
insist
upon
having
a
bright
genius
for
my
mate
i
confess
i
should
like
that
my
husband
genius
was
at
least
as
bright
as
my
own
said
mary
and
i
ca
think
there
is
anything
unreasonable
in
that
or
rather
i
should
say
were
i
a
genius
myself
i
could
better
dispense
with
a
certain
portion
of
intellect
in
my
husband
as
it
has
been
generally
remarked
that
those
who
are
largely
endowed
themselves
can
easier
dispense
with
talents
in
their
companions
than
others
of
more
moderate
endowments
can
do
but
virtue
and
talents
on
the
one
side
virtue
and
tenderness
on
the
other
i
look
upon
as
the
principal
ingredients
in
a
happy
union
well
i
intend
to
be
excessively
happy
and
yet
i
do
think
edward
will
ever
find
the
longitude
and
as
for
my
tenderness
humph
as
lady
maclaughlan
says
but
as
for
you
i
rather
think
you
in
some
danger
of
turning
into
an
aunt
grizzy
with
a
long
waist
and
large
pockets
peppermint
drops
and
powdered
curls
but
whatever
you
do
for
heaven
sake
let
us
have
no
more
human
sacrifices
if
you
do
i
shall
certainly
appear
at
your
wedding
in
sackcloth
and
this
was
all
of
comfort
or
advice
that
her
ladyship
could
bestow
as
lady
emily
was
not
a
person
who
concealed
either
her
own
secrets
or
those
of
others
colonel
lennox
was
not
long
of
hearing
from
her
what
had
passed
and
of
being
made
thoroughly
acquainted
with
sentiments
on
love
and
marriage
such
a
heart
must
be
worth
winning
thought
he
but
he
sighed
to
think
that
he
had
less
chance
for
the
prize
than
another
independent
of
his
narrow
fortune
which
he
was
aware
would
be
an
insuperable
bar
to
obtaining
lady
juliana
consent
coldness
and
reserve
towards
him
seemed
to
increase
rather
than
diminish
or
if
she
sometimes
gave
way
to
the
natural
frankness
and
gaiety
of
her
disposition
before
him
a
word
or
look
expressive
of
admiration
on
his
part
instantly
recalled
to
her
those
painful
ideas
which
had
been
for
a
moment
forgot
and
seemed
to
throw
him
at
a
greater
distance
than
ever
colonel
lennox
was
too
himself
to
suppose
for
an
instant
that
mary
actually
felt
dislike
towards
him
because
at
the
commencement
of
their
acquaintance
he
had
not
done
justice
to
her
merits
but
he
was
also
aware
that
until
he
had
explained
to
her
the
nature
of
his
sentiments
she
must
naturally
regard
his
attentions
with
suspicion
and
consider
them
rather
as
acts
of
duty
towards
his
mother
than
as
the
spontaneous
expression
of
his
own
attachment
he
therefore
in
the
most
simple
and
candid
manner
laid
open
to
her
the
secret
of
his
heart
and
in
all
the
eloquence
of
real
passion
poured
forth
those
feelings
of
love
and
admiration
with
which
she
had
unconsciously
inspired
him
for
a
moment
mary
distrust
was
overcome
by
the
ardour
of
his
address
and
the
open
manly
manner
in
which
he
had
avowed
the
rise
and
progress
of
his
attachment
and
she
yielded
herself
up
to
the
delightful
conviction
of
loving
and
being
beloved
but
soon
that
gave
way
to
the
mortifying
reflection
that
rushed
over
her
mind
he
tried
to
love
me
thought
she
but
it
is
in
obedience
to
his
mother
wish
and
he
thinks
he
has
succeeded
no
no
i
can
not
be
the
dupe
of
his
delusion
i
will
not
give
myself
to
one
who
has
been
solicited
to
love
me
and
again
wounded
delicacy
and
woman
pride
resumed
their
empire
over
her
and
she
rejected
the
idea
of
receiving
colonel
lennox
as
a
lover
he
heard
her
determination
with
the
deepest
anguish
and
used
every
argument
and
entreaty
to
soften
her
resolution
but
mary
had
wrought
herself
up
to
a
pitch
of
had
rejected
the
man
she
loved
the
only
man
she
ever
love
that
done
to
persist
in
the
sacrifice
seemed
easy
and
they
parted
with
increased
attachment
in
their
hearts
even
though
those
hearts
seemed
severed
for
ever
soon
after
he
set
off
to
join
his
regiment
and
it
was
only
in
saying
farewell
that
mary
felt
how
deeply
her
happiness
was
involved
in
the
fate
of
the
man
she
had
for
ever
renounced
to
no
one
did
she
impart
what
had
passed
and
lady
emily
was
too
dull
herself
for
some
days
after
the
departure
of
her
friend
to
take
any
notice
of
dejection
chapter

some

mary
found
herself
bereft
of
both
her
lovers
nearly
at
the
same
time
lord
glenallan
after
formally
renewing
his
suit
at
length
took
a
final
leave
and
returned
to
scotland
lady
juliana
indignation
could
only
be
equalled
by
redgill
upon
the
occasion
he
had
planned
a
snug
retreat
for
himself
during
the
game
season
at
glenallan
castle
where
from
the
and
easy
temper
of
both
master
and
mistress
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
he
should
in
time
come
to
the
roast
and
be
lord
paramount
over
kitchen
and
larder
his
disappointment
was
therefore
great
at
finding
all
the
solid
joys
of
red
deer
and
kippered
salmon
and
mutton
hams
vanish
like
the
baseless
fabric
of
a
vision
leaving
not
a
wreck
behind
refused
lord
glenallan
exclaimed
he
to
lady
emily
upon
first
hearing
of
it
the
thing
incredible
absolutely
impossible
i
believe
it
that
right
doctor
who
is
it
that
says
still
believe
the
story
false
that
not
to
be
true
i
admire
your
candour
and
wish
i
could
imitate
it
then
your
ladyship
really
believes
it
my
soul
i
i
it
really
a
very
vexatious
affair
i
feel
for
lady
juliana
poor
woman
no
wonder
she
and
twenty
thousand
a
year
refused
what
is
it
she
would
have
the
finest
deer
park
in
scotland
every
sort
of
game
upon
the
estate
a
salmon
fishing
at
the
very
door
i
should
just
like
to
know
what
the
meaning
of
it
can
not
you
guess
doctor
asked
lady
emily
guess
no
my
soul
i
defy
any
man
to
guess
what
could
tempt
a
woman
to
refuse
five
and
twenty
thousand
a
year
unless
indeed
she
has
something
higher
in
view
and
even
then
she
should
be
pretty
sure
of
her
mark
but
i
suppose
because
miss
adelaide
has
got
a
duke
she
thinks
she
must
have
one
too
i
suppose
that
the
story
but
i
can
tell
her
dukes
are
not
so
plenty
and
she
by
no
means
so
fine
a
woman
as
her
sister
and
her
market
spoilt
or
i
much
mistaken
what
man
in
his
senses
would
ever
ask
a
woman
who
had
been
such
an
idiot
as
to
refuse
five
and
twenty
thousand
a
year
i
see
doctor
you
are
quite
a
novice
in
the
tender
passion
can
not
you
make
allowance
for
it
a
young
lady
not
being
in
love
in
what
demanded
the
doctor
in
love
repeated
lady
emily
love
bah
nonsense
no
mortal
in
their
senses
ever
thinks
of
such
stuff
now
then
you
think
love
and
madness
are
one
and
the
same
thing
it
seems
i
think
the
man
or
woman
who
could
let
their
love
stand
in
the
way
of
five
and
twenty
thousand
a
year
is
the
next
thing
to
being
mad
said
the
doctor
warmly
and
in
this
case
i
can
see
no
difference
but
you
allow
there
are
some
sorts
of
love
that
may
be
indulged
without
casting
any
shade
upon
the
understanding
i
really
ca
tell
what
your
ladyship
means
said
the
doctor
impatiently
i
mean
for
example
the
love
one
may
feel
towards
a
turtle
such
as
we
had
lately
that
quite
a
different
thing
interrupted
the
doctor
pardon
me
but
whatever
the
consequence
may
be
the
effects
in
both
cases
were
very
similar
as
exemplified
in
yourself
pray
what
difference
did
it
make
to
your
friends
who
were
deprived
of
your
society
whether
you
spent
your
time
in
walking
with
step
and
musing
gait
before
your
dulcinea
window
or
the
cistern
whether
you
were
engrossed
in
composing
a
sonnet
to
your
mistress
eyebrow
or
in
contriving
a
new
method
of
heightening
the
enjoyments
of
whether
you
expatiated
with
greater
rapture
on
the
charms
of
a
white
skin
or
green
fat
whether
you
were
most
devoted
to
a
languishing
or
a
lively
beauty
whether
my
honour
lady
emily
i
really
i
i
ca
conceive
what
it
is
you
mean
there
a
time
for
everything
and
i
sure
nobody
but
yourself
would
ever
have
thought
of
bringing
in
a
turtle
to
a
conversation
upon
marriage
on
the
contrary
doctor
i
thought
it
had
been
upon
love
and
i
was
endeavouring
to
convince
you
that
even
the
wisest
of
men
may
be
susceptible
of
certain
tender
emotions
towards
a
beloved
object
you
never
convince
me
that
any
but
a
fool
can
be
in
love
cried
the
doctor
his
visage
assuming
a
darker
purple
as
the
argument
advanced
then
you
must
rank
lord
glenallan
with
his
five
and
twenty
thousand
a
year
amongst
the
number
for
he
is
desperately
in
love
i
assure
you
as
to
that
lord
glenallan
or
any
man
with
his
fortune
may
be
whatever
he
chooses
he
has
a
right
to
be
in
love
he
can
afford
to
be
in
love
i
have
heard
much
of
the
torments
of
love
said
lady
emily
but
i
never
heard
it
rated
as
a
luxury
before
i
hope
there
is
no
chance
of
your
being
made
premier
otherwise
i
fear
we
should
have
a
tax
upon
immediately
it
would
be
greatly
for
the
advantage
of
the
nation
as
well
as
the
comfort
of
individuals
if
there
was
returned
the
doctor
many
a
pleasant
fellow
has
been
lost
to
society
by
what
you
call
a
i
speak
from
experience
i
was
obliged
to
drop
the
oldest
friend
i
had
upon
his
making
one
of
your
what
you
were
afraid
of
the
effects
of
evil
example
asked
lady
emily
no
it
was
not
for
that
but
he
asked
me
to
take
a
family
dinner
with
him
one
day
and
i
without
knowing
anything
of
the
character
of
the
woman
he
had
married
was
weak
enough
to
go
i
found
a
very
tablecloth
and
a
shoulder
of
mutton
which
ended
our
acquaintance
i
never
entered
his
door
after
it
in
fact
no
man
happiness
is
proof
against
dirty
tablecloths
and
bad
dinners
and
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
lady
emily
these
are
the
invariable
accompaniments
of
your
pshaw
that
is
only
amongst
the
said
lady
emily
affectedly
that
is
not
the
sort
of
i
mean
to
have
here
is
to
be
the
style
of
my
domestic
establishment
and
she
repeated
shenstone
beautiful
pastoral
my
banks
they
are
furnished
with
bees
till
she
came
to
i
have
found
out
a
gift
for
my
fair
i
have
found
where
the
breed
there
some
sense
in
that
cried
the
doctor
who
had
been
listening
with
great
weariness
you
may
have
a
good
or
sauté
de
pigeons
au
sang
which
is
still
better
when
well
dressed
shocking
exclaimed
lady
emily
to
mention
in
the
same
breath
with
nightingales
and
roses
i
tell
you
what
lady
emily
it
just
these
sort
of
nonsensical
descriptions
that
do
all
the
mischief
amongst
you
young
ladies
these
confounded
poets
that
turn
all
your
heads
and
make
you
think
you
have
nothing
to
do
after
you
are
married
but
sit
beside
fountains
and
grottoes
and
divert
yourself
with
birds
and
flowers
instead
of
looking
after
your
servants
and
paying
your
butcher
bills
and
after
all
what
is
the
substance
of
that
trash
you
have
just
been
reading
but
to
say
that
the
man
was
a
substantial
farmer
and
grazier
and
had
bees
though
i
never
heard
of
any
man
in
his
senses
going
to
sleep
amongst
his
beehives
before
my
soul
if
i
had
my
will
i
would
burn
every
line
of
poetry
that
ever
was
written
a
good
recipe
for
a
pudding
is
worth
all
that
your
shenstones
and
the
whole
set
of
them
ever
wrote
and
there
more
good
sense
and
useful
information
in
this
book
rapping
his
knuckles
against
a
volume
he
held
in
his
hand
than
in
all
your
poets
ancient
and
modern
lady
emily
took
it
out
of
his
hand
and
opened
it
and
some
very
poetical
description
too
doctor
although
you
affect
to
despise
it
so
much
here
is
an
eulogium
on

that
nothing

of

with

and
these
these
woodcocks
perfectly
swarm
on
the
glenallan
estate
in
the
season
cried
the
doctor
and
to
think
that
such
a
man
should
have
been
refused
but
miss
mary
will
repent
this
the
longest
day
she
lives
i
had
a
cook
in
my
eye
for
them
too
one
who
is
quite
up
to
the
making
of
this
my
soul
she
deserve
to
live
upon
sheep
head
and
haggis
for
the
rest
of
her
life
and
if
i
was
lady
juliana
i
would
try
the
effect
of
bread
and
water
she
certainly
does
not
aspire
to
such
joys
as
are
here
portrayed
in
this
book
of
life
said
lady
emily
for
i
suspect
she
could
endure
existence
even
upon
roast
mutton
with
the
man
she
loves
that
nothing
to
the
purpose
unless
the
man
she
loves
as
you
call
it
loves
to
live
upon
roast
mutton
too
take
my
word
for
it
unless
she
gives
her
husband
good
dinners
he
not
care
twopence
for
her
in
a
week
time
i
look
upon
bad
dinners
to
be
the
source
of
much
of
the
misery
we
hear
of
in
the
married
life
women
are
much
mistaken
if
they
think
it
by
dressing
themselves
they
are
to
please
their
husbands
pardon
me
doctor
we
must
be
the
best
judges
there
and
i
have
the
authority
of
all
ages
and
sages
in
my
favour
the
beauty
and
the
charms
of
women
have
been
the
favourite
theme
time
immemorial
now
no
one
ever
heard
of
a
fair
one
being
celebrated
for
her
skill
in
cookery
there
i
beg
leave
to
differ
from
you
said
the
doctor
with
an
air
of
exultation
again
referring
to
his

it
was

that

was

in

love

the

indeed
a
very
likely
story
do
i
know
that
all
our

carry
off
the

that
there
no
such
living
anywhere
as
in

are

in

they
live
at

when

they

they
can
eat

i
do
pretend
to
know
much
about
it
but
i
suspect
there
more
cooks
than
cupids
to
be
seen
about
it
and
for
the

i
shall
only
say
i
never
heard
of
any
of
your
or
picnics
where
all
the
pleasure
did
seem
to
consist
in
the
eating
and
drinking
ah
doctor
i
perceive
you
have
taken
all
your
ideas
on
that
subject
from
werter
who
certainly
was
a
sort
of
a
sentimental
he
seems
to
have
enjoyed
so
much
drinking
his
coffee
under
the
shade
of
the

going
to
the
kitchen
to
take
his
own
and
then
he
breaks
out
into
such
raptures
at
the
idea
of
the
illustrious
lovers
of
penelope
killing
and
dressing
their
own
meat
butchers
and
cooks
in

only
conceive
them
with
their
great
knives
and
blue
aprons
or
their
spits
and
white
nightcaps
poor
penelope
no
wonder
she
preferred
spinning
to
marrying
one
of
these
creatures

have
an

had
not
lady
juliana
wrath
been
for

suspended
by
an
invitation
to

house
true
nothing
could
be
colder
than
the
terms
in
which
it
was
couched
but
to
that
her
ladyship
was
insensible
and
would
have
been
equally
indifferent
had
she
known
that
such
as
it
was
she
owed
it
more
to
the
obstinacy
of
her
than
the
affection
of
her
daughter
the
duke
of
altamont
was
one
of
those
who
attach
great
ideas
of
dignity
to
always
carrying
their
point
and
though
he
might
sometimes
be
obliged
to
suspend
his
plans
he
never
had
been
known
to
relinquish
them
had
he
settled
in
his
own
mind
to
tie
his
neckcloth
in
a
particular
way
not
all
the
eloquence
of
cicero
or
the

of

have
induced
him
to
alter
it
and

the
haughty
adelaide
soon
found
that
of
all
yokes
the
most
insupportable
is
the
yoke
of
an
obstinate
fool
in
the
thousand
trifling
occurances
of
domestic
life
for
his
grace
was
interested
in
all
the
minutiae
of
his
establishment
where
good
sense
and
good
humour
on
either
side
would
have
gracefully
yielded
to
the
other
there
was
a
perpetual
contest
for
dominion
which
invariably
ended
in
defeat
the
duke
indeed
never
disputed
or
reasoned
or
even
replied
but
the
thing
was
done
till
at
the
end
of
six
weeks
the
duchess
of
altamont
most
heartily
hated
and
despised
the
man
she
had
so
lately
vowed
to
love
and
obey
on
the
present
occasion
his
grace
certainly
appeared
in
the
most
amiable
light
in
wishing
to
have
lady
juliana
invited
to
his
house
but
in
fact
it
proceeded
entirely
from
his
besetting
sin
obstinacy
he
had
propose
her
accompanying
her
daughter
at
the
time
of
her
marriage
and
been
overruled
but
with
all
the
pertinacity
of
a
little
mind
he
had
kept
fast
hold
of
the
idea
merely
because
it
was
his
own
and
he
was
now
determined
to
have
it
put
in
execution
in
a
postscript
to
the
letter
and
in
the
same
cordial
style
the
duchess
said
something
of
a
hope
that
her
mother
did
come
to
town
mary
should
accompany
her
but
this
her
ladyship
to
mary
great
relief
declared
should
not
be
although
she
certainly
was
very
much
at
a
loss
how
to
dispose
of
her
mary
timidly
expressed
her
wish
to
be
permitted
to
return
to
lochmarlie
and
mentioned
that
her
uncle
and
aunt
had
repeatedly
offered
to
come
to
bath
for
her
if
she
might
be
allowed
to
accompany
them
home
but
to
this
her
mother
also
gave
a
decided
negative
adding
that
she
never
should
see
lochmarlie
again
if
she
could
help
it
in
short
she
must
remain
where
she
was
till
something
could
be
fixed
as
to
her
future
destination
it
was
most
excessively
tiresome
to
be
clogged
with
a
great
unmarried
daughter
her
ladyship
observed
as
she
sprang
into
the
carriage
with
a
train
of
dogs
and
drove
off
to
dear
delightful
london
but
alas
the
insecurity
of
even
the
schemes
of
human
foresight
lady
juliana
was
in
the
midst
of
arrangements
for
endless
pleasures
when
she
received
accounts
of
the
death
of
her
now
almost
forgotten
husband
he
had
died
from
the
gradual
effects
of
the
climate
and
that
was
all
that
remained
to
be
told
of
the
unfortunate
henry
douglas
if
his
heartless
wife
shed
some
natural
tears
she
wiped
them
soon
but
the
wounds
of
disappointment
and
vanity
were
not
so
speedily
effaced
as
she
contrasted
the
brilliant
with
the
unbecoming
widow
cap
oh
she
so
detested
black
things
it
was
so
hateful
to
wear
mourning
she
never
could
feel
happy
or
comfortable
in
black
and
at
such
a
time
how
particularly
unfortunate
poor
douglas
she
was
very
sorry
and
so
ended
the
holiest
and
most
indissoluble
of
human
ties
the
duchess
did
not
think
it
incumbent
upon
her
to
be
affected
by
the
death
of
a
person
she
had
never
seen
but
she
put
on
mourning
put
off
her
presentation
at
court
for
a
week
and
stayed
away
one
night
from
the
opera
on
mary
warm
and
unpolluted
heart
the
tidings
of
her
father
death
produced
a
very
different
effect
though
she
had
never
known
in
their
fullest
extent
those
feelings
of
filial
affection
whose
source
begins
with
our
being
and
over
which
memory
loves
to
linger
as
at
the
hallowed
fount
of
the
purest
of
earthly
joys
she
had
been
taught
to
cherish
a
fond
remembrance
of
him
to
whom
she
owed
her
being
she
had
been
brought
up
in
the
land
of
his
birth
his
image
was
associated
in
her
mind
with
many
of
the
scenes
most
dear
to
her
his
name
and
his
memory
were
familiar
to
those
amongst
whom
she
dwelt
and
thus
her
feelings
of
natural
affection
had
been
preserved
in
all
their
genuine
warmth
and
tenderness
many
a
letter
and
many
a
little
token
of
her
love
she
had
from
her
earliest
years
been
accustomed
to
send
him
and
she
had
ever
fondly
cherished
the
hope
of
her
father
return
and
that
she
would
yet
know
the
happiness
of
being
blest
in
a
parent
love
but
now
all
these
hopes
were
extinguished
and
while
she
wept
over
them
in
bitterness
of
heart
she
yet
bowed
with
pious
resignation
to
the
decree
of
heaven
chapter

shall

we
disdain
their
silent
soft
address
their
posthumous
advice
and

young
for
some
months
all
was
peaceful
seclusion
in
mary
life
and
the
only
varieties
she
knew
were
occasional
visits
to
aunt
grizzy
and
now
and
then
spending
some
days
with
lennox
she
saw
with
sorrow
the
declining
health
of
her
venerable
friend
whose
wasted
form
and
delicate
features
had
now
assumed
an
almost
ethereal
aspect
yet
she
never
complained
and
it
was
only
from
her
languor
and
weakness
that
mary
guessed
she
suffered
when
urged
to
have
recourse
to
medical
advice
she
only
smiled
and
shook
her
head
yet
ever
gentle
and
complying
to
the
wishes
of
others
she
was
at
length
prevailed
upon
to
receive
the
visits
of
a
medical
attendant
and
her
own
feelings
were
but
too
faithfully
confirmed
by
his
opinion
being
an
old
friend
of
the
family
he
took
upon
himself
to
communicate
the
intelligence
to
her
son
then
abroad
with
his
regiment
and
in
the
meantime
mary
took
up
her
residence
at
rose
hall
and
devoted
herself
unceasingly
to
the
beloved
friend
she
felt
she
was
so
soon
to
lose
ah
mary
she
would
sometimes
say
god
forgive
me
but
my
heart
is
not
yet
weaned
from
worldly
wishes
even
now
when
i
feel
all
the
vanity
of
human
happiness
i
think
how
it
would
have
soothed
my
last
moments
could
i
have
but
seen
you
my
son
before
i
left
the
world
yet
alas
our
time
here
is
so
short
that
it
matters
little
whether
it
be
spent
in
joy
or
grief
provided
it
be
spent
in
innocence
and
virtue
mine
has
been
a
long
life
compared
to
many
but
when
i
look
back
upon
it
what
a
span
it
seems
and
it
is
not
the
remembrance
of
its
brightest
days
that
are
now
a
solace
to
my
heart
dearest
mary
if
you
live
long
you
will
live
to
think
of
the
sad
hours
you
have
given
me
as
the
fairest
of
perhaps
of
many
a
happy
day
that
i
trust
heaven
has
yet
in
store
for
you
yes
god
has
made
some
whose
powers
are
chiefly
ordained
to
comfort
the
afflicted
and
in
fulfilling
his
will
you
must
surly
be
blest
mary
listened
to
the
wishes
of
her
dear
old
friend
with
painful
feelings
of
regret
and
charles
lennox
loved
me
thought
she
truly
tenderly
loved
me
and
had
i
but
repaid
his
noble
frankness
had
i
suffered
him
to
read
my
heart
when
he
laid
his
open
before
me
i
might
now
have
gladdened
the
last
days
of
the
mother
he
adores
i
might
have
proudly
avowed
that
affection
i
must
now
forever
hide
but
at
the
end
of
some
weeks
lennox
was
no
longer
susceptible
of
emotions
either
of
joy
or
sorrow
she
gradually
sank
into
a
state
of
almost
total
insensibility
from
which
not
even
the
arrival
of
her
son
had
power
to
rouse
her
his
anguish
was
extreme
at
finding
his
mother
in
a
condition
so
perfectly
hopeless
and
every
other
idea
seemed
for
the
present
absorbed
in
his
anxiety
for
her
as
mary
witnessed
his
watchful
cares
and
tender
solicitude
she
could
almost
have
envied
the
unconscious
object
of
such
devoted
attachment
a
few
days
after
his
arrival
his
leave
of
absence
was
abruptly
recalled
and
he
was
summoned
to
repair
to
headquarters
with
all
possible
expedition
the
army
was
on
the
move
and
a
battle
was
expected
to
be
fought
at
such
a
time
hesitation
or
delay
under
any
circumstances
would
have
been
inevitable
disgrace
and
dreadful
as
was
the
alternative
colonel
lennox
wavered
not
an
instant
in
his
resolution
with
a
look
of
fixed
agony
but
without
uttering
a
syllable
he
put
the
letter
into
mary
hand
as
she
sat
by
his
mother
bedside
and
then
left
the
room
to
order
preparations
to
be
made
for
his
instant
departure
on
his
return
mary
witnessed
the
painful
conflict
of
his
feelings
in
his
extreme
agitation
as
he
approached
his
mother
to
look
for
the
last
time
on
those
features
already
moulded
into
more
than
mortal
beauty
a
bright
ray
of
the
setting
sun
streamed
full
upon
that
face
now
reposing
in
the
awful
but
hallowed
calm
which
is
sometimes
diffused
around
the
bed
of
death
the
sacred
stillness
was
only
broken
by
the
evening
song
of
the
blackbird
and
the
distant
lowing
of
the
cattle
sounds
which
had
often
brought
pleasure
to
that
heart
now
insensible
to
all
human
emotion
all
nature
shone
forth
in
gaiety
and
splendour
but
the
eye
and
the
ear
were
alike
closed
against
all
earthly
objects
yet
who
can
tell
the
brightness
of
those
visions
with
which
the
parting
soul
may
be
visited
sounds
and
sights
alike
unheard
unknown
to
mortal
sense
may
then
hold
divine
communion
with
the
soaring
spirit
and
inspire
it
with
bliss
inconceivable
ineffable
colonel
lennox
gazed
upon
the
countenance
of
his
mother
again
and
again
he
pressed
her
inanimate
hands
to
his
lips
and
bedewed
them
with
his
tears
as
about
to
tear
himself
from
her
for
ever
at
that
moment
she
opened
her
eyes
and
regarded
him
with
a
look
of
intelligence
which
spoke
at
once
to
his
heart
he
felt
that
he
was
seen
and
known
her
look
was
long
and
fondly
fixed
upon
his
face
then
turned
to
mary
with
an
expression
so
deep
and
earnest
that
both
felt
the
instantaneous
appeal
the
veil
seemed
to
drop
from
their
hearts
one
glance
sufficed
to
tell
that
both
were
fondly
truly
loved
and
as
colonel
lennox
received
mary
almost
fainting
form
in
his
arms
he
knelt
by
his
mother
and
implored
her
blessing
on
her
children
a
smile
of
angelic
brightness
beamed
upon
her
face
as
she
extended
her
hand
towards
them
and
her
lips
moved
as
in
prayer
though
no
sound
escaped
them
one
long
and
lingering
look
was
given
to
those
so
dear
even
in
death
she
then
raised
her
eyes
to
heaven
and
the
spirit
sought
its
native
skies

it
was
long
before
mary
could
believe
in
the
reality
of
what
had
passed
it
appeared
to
her
as
a
beautiful
yet
awful
dream
could
it
be
that
she
had
plighted
her
faith
by
the
bed
of

that
the
last
look
of

departed

charles

had
claimed
her
as
his
own
even
in
the
agony
of
tearing
himself
from
all
he
loved
and
that
she
had
only
felt
how
dear
she
was
to
him
at
the
very
moment
when
she
had
parted
from
him
perhaps
for
ever
but
mary
strove
to
banish
these
overwhelming
thoughts
from
her
mind

she
devoted
herself
to
the
performance
of
the
last
duties
to
her
departed

lady
emily

been
a
daily
visitor
at

during
illness
and
had
taken
a
lively
interest
in
the
situation
of
the
family
but
notwithstanding
it
was
some
time
before
mary
could
so
far
subdue
her
feelings
as
to
speak
with
composure
of
what
had
passed
she
felt
too
how
impossible
it
was
by
words
to
convey
to
her
any
idea
of
that
excitement
of
mind
where
a
whole
life
of
ordinary
feeling
seems
concentrated
in
one
sudden
but
ineffable
emotion
all
that
had
passed
might
be
imagined
but
could
not
be
told
and
she
shrank
from
the
task
of
portraying
those
deep
and
sacred
feelings
which
language
never
could
impart
to
the
breast
of
another
yet
she
felt
it
was
using
her
cousin
unkindly
to
keep
her
in
ignorance
of
what
she
was
certain
would
give
her
pleasure
to
hear
and
summoning
her
resolution
she
at
length
disclosed
to
her
all
that
had
taken
place
her
own
embarrassment
was
too
great
to
allow
her
to
remark

as
she
listened
to

communication
and
after
it

struggling
with
her
emotions
at
length
she
exclaimed
indignantly
and
so
it
seems

you
have
all

playing

dying

while
yours

your

mary
was

much
confounded
by
her
cousin
reproaches
to
be
able
to
reply
to
them
for
some
time

when
she
did
attempt
to
vindicate
herself
she
found
it

in
vain

her
and
in
haughty
displeasure
quitted
the
room
leaving
poor
mary
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
and
amazement
there
was
a
simplicity
of
heart
a
singleness
of
idea
in
herself
that
prevented
her
from
ever
attaching
suspicion
to
others
but
a
sort
of
vague
undefined
apprehension
floated
through
her
brain
as
she
revolved
the
extraordinary
behaviour
of
her
cousin
yet
it
was
that
sort
of
feeling
to
which
she
could
not
give
either
a
local
habitation
or
a
name
and
she
continued
for
some
time
in
that
most
bewildering
state
of
trying
yet
not
daring
to
think
some
time
elapsed
and
confusion
of
ideas
was
increasing
rather
than
diminishing
when
lady
emily
slowly
entered
the
room
and
stood
some
moments
before
her
without
speaking
at
length
making
an
effort
she
abruptly
said
pray
mary
tell
me
what
you
think
of
me
mary
looked
at
her
with
surprise
i
think
of
you
my
dear
cousin
as
i
have
always
done
that
is
no
answer
to
my
question
what
do
you
think
of
my
behaviour
just
now
i
think
said
mary
gently
that
if
you
have
misunderstood
me
that
open
and
candid
yourself
almost
to
a
fault
you
readily
resent
the
remotest
appearance
of
duplicity
in
others
but
you
are
too
generous
not
to
do
me
justice
ah
mary
how
little
do
i
appeal
in
my
own
eyes
at
this
moment
and
how
little
with
all
my
boasting
have
i
known
my
own
heart
no
it
was
not
because
i
am
open
and
candid
that
i
resented
your
engagement
with
colonel
lennox
it
was
because
i
was
because
can
not
you
guess
mary
colour
rose
as
she
cast
down
her
eyes
and
exclaimed
with
agitation
indeed
lady
emily
threw
her
arms
around
her
dear
mary
you
are
perhaps
the
only
person
upon
earth
i
would
make
such
a
confession
to
it
was
because
i
who
had
plighted
my
faith
to
another
i
who
piqued
myself
upon
my
openness
and
fidelity
i
how
it
chokes
me
to
utter
it
i
was
beginning
to
love
him
myself
only
beginning
observe
for
it
is
already
over
i
needed
but
to
be
aware
of
my
danger
to
overcome
it
colonel
lennox
is
now
no
more
to
me
than
your
lover
and
edward
is
again
all
that
he
ever
was
to
me
but
i
what
am
i
faithless
and
and
a
few
tears
dropped
from
her
eyes
mary
too
much
affected
to
speak
could
only
press
her
in
silence
to
her
heart
these
are
tears
of
shame
of
penitence
though
i
must
own
they
look
very
like
those
of
regret
and
mortification
what
a
mercy
it
is
that
chemist
magic
art
these
sacred
treasures
said
she
with
a
smile
as
she
shook
a
from
her
hand
they
are
gems
i
am
really
not
at
all
fond
of
appearing
in
and
yet
you
never
appeared
to
greater
advantage
said
mary
as
she
regarded
her
with
admiration
ah
so
you
say
but
there
is
perhaps
a
little
womanish
feeling
lurking
there
and
now
you
doubtless
expect
no
do
but
another
would
that
i
should
begin
a
sentimental
description
of
the
rise
and
progress
of
this
attachment
as
i
suppose
it
would
be
styled
in
the
language
of
romance
but
in
truth
i
can
tell
you
nothing
at
all
about
it
perhaps
colonel
lennox
said
mary
blushing
and
hesitating
to
name
her
suspicion
no
no
colonel
lennox
was
not
to
blame
there
was
no
false
play
on
either
side
he
is
as
much
above
the
meanness
of
coquetry
as
i
must
say
it
as
i
am
his
thoughts
were
all
along
taken
up
with
you
even
while
he
talked
and
laughed
and
quarrelled
with
me
while
i
so
strong
in
the
belief
that
worlds
could
not
shake
my
allegiance
to
edward
could
have
challenged
all
mankind
to
win
my
love
and
this
wicked
wayward
faithless
heart
kept
silent
till
you
spoke
and
then
it
uttered
such
a
fearful
sound
and
yet
i
do
think
it
was
love
neither
bien
seule
fois
la
première
it
was
rather
a
sort
of
an
idle
childish
engrossing
sentiment
that
have
grown
to
something
stronger
but
is
past
now
i
have
shown
you
all
the
weakness
of
my
heart
despise
me
if
you
will
dearest
lady
emily
had
i
the
same
skill
to
show
the
sentiments
of
mine
you
would
there
see
what
i
can
not
express
how
i
admire
this
noble
candour
this
generous
oh
as
to
meanly
hiding
my
faults
that
is
what
i
scorn
to
do
i
may
be
ignorant
of
them
myself
and
in
ignorance
i
may
cherish
them
but
once
convinced
of
them
i
give
them
to
the
winds
and
all
who
choose
may
pick
them
up
violent
and
unjust
and
i
have
been
and
may
be
again
but
deceitful
i
never
was
and
never
will
be
my
dear
cousin
what
might
you
not
be
if
you
chose
ah
i
know
what
you
mean
and
i
begin
to
think
you
are
in
the
right
i
believe
i
shall
come
to
be
of
your
way
of
thinking
if
ever
i
have
a
daughter
she
certainly
shall
but
not
just
at
present
the
reformation
would
be
too
sudden
all
that
i
can
promise
for
at
present
is
that
i
will
chide
no
breather
in
the
world
but
myself
against
whom
i
know
most
faults
and
now
from
this
day
from
this
moment
i
vow
no
i
shall
do
it
for
you
said
mary
with
a
smile
as
she
threw
her
arms
around
her
neck
henceforth
golden
laws
of
love
shall
be
upon
this
pillar
hung
a
simple
heart
a
single
eye
a
true
and
constant
tongue
no
man
for
more
love
pretend
than
he
has
hearts
in
store
true
love
begun
shall
never
end
love
one
and
love
no
more
marquis
of
montrose
but
much
as
mary
loved
and
admired
her
cousin
she
could
not
be
blind
to
the
defects
of
her
character
and
she
feared
they
might
yet
be
productive
of
great
unhappiness
to
herself
her
mind
was
open
to
the
reception
of
every
image
that
brought
pleasure
along
with
it
while
in
the
same
spirit
she
turned
from
everything
that
wore
an
air
of
seriousness
or
and
even
the
best
affections
of
a
naturally
good
heart
were
borne
away
by
the
ardour
of
her
feelings
and
the
impetuosity
of
her
temper
mary
grieved
to
see
the
graces
of
a
noble
mind
thus
running
wild
for
want
of
early
culture
and
she
sought
by
every
means
save
those
of
lecture
and
admonition
to
lead
her
to
more
fixed
habits
of
reflection
and
self
examination
but
it
required
all
her
strength
of
mind
to
turn
her
thoughts
at
this
time
from
herself
to
another
she
the
betrothed
of
one
who
was
now
in
the
midst
of
danger
of
whose
existence
she
was
even
uncertain
but
on
whose
fate
she
felt
her
own
suspended
oh
thought
she
with
bitterness
of
heart
how
dangerous
it
is
to
yield
too
much
even
to
our
best
affections
i
with
so
many
objects
to
share
in
mine
have
yet
pledged
my
happiness
on
a
being
perishable
as
myself
and
her
soul
sickened
at
the
ills
her
fancy
drew
but
she
strove
to
repress
this
strength
of
attachment
which
she
felt
would
otherwise
become
too
powerful
for
her
reason
to
control
and
if
she
did
not
entirely
succeed
at
least
the
efforts
she
made
and
the
continual
exercise
of
mind
enabled
her
in
some
degree
to
counteract
the
baleful
effects
of
morbid
anxiety
and
overweening
attachment
at
length
her
apprehensions
were
relieved
for
a
time
by
a
letter
from
colonel
lennox
an
engagement
with
the
enemy
had
taken
place
but
he
had
escaped
unhurt
he
repeated
his
vows
of
unalterable
affection
and
mary
felt
that
she
was
justified
in
receiving
them
she
had
made
lady
juliana
and
douglas
both
acquainted
with
her
situation
the
former
had
taken
no
notice
of
the
communication
but
the
latter
had
expressed
her
approval
in
all
the
warmth
and
tenderness
of
gratified
affection
chapter
xxix
preach
as
i
please
i
doubt
our
curious
men
will
choose
a
pheasant
still
before
a
hen
horace
amongst
the
various
occupations
to
which
mary
devoted
herself
there
was
none
which
merits
to
be
recorded
as
a
greater
act
of
immolation
than
her
unremitting
attentions
to
aunt
grizzy
it
wa
not
merely
the
sacrifice
of
time
and
talents
that
was
required
for
carrying
on
this
intercourse
these
it
is
to
be
hoped
even
the
most
selfish
can
occasionally
sacrifice
to
the
of
society
but
it
was
as
it
were
a
total
surrender
of
her
whole
being
to
a
mind
of
any
reflection
no
situation
can
ever
be
very
irksome
in
which
we
can
enjoy
the
privileges
of
sitting
still
and
keeping
silent
but
as
the
companion
of
miss
grizzy
quiet
and
reflection
were
alike
unattainable
when
not
engaged
in
with
sir
sampson
her
life
was
spent
in
losing
her
scissors
mislaying
her
spectacles
wondering
what
had
become
of
her
thimble
and
speculating
on
the
disappearance
of
a
needle
all
of
which
losses
daily
and
hourly
recurring
subjected
mary
to
an
unceasing
annoyance
for
she
could
not
be
five
minutes
in
her
aunt
company
without
out
being
at
least
as
many
times
disturbed
with
mary
my
dear
will
you
get
up
i
think
my
spectacles
must
be
about
you
or
mary
my
dear
your
eyes
are
younger
than
mine
will
you
look
if
you
can
see
my
needle
on
the
carpet
or
are
you
sure
mary
that
not
my
thimble
you
have
got
it
very
like
it
and
i
sure
i
ca
conceive
what
become
of
mine
if
that
not
it
etc
etc
etc
but
her
idleness
was
if
possible
still
more
irritating
than
her
industry
when
she
betook
herself
to
the
window
it
was
one
incessant
cry
of
who
coach
is
that
mary
with
the
green
and
orange
liveries
come
and
look
at
this
lady
and
gentleman
mary
i
sure
i
wonder
who
they
are
here
something
i
declare
sure
i
do
know
what
you
call
it
come
here
mary
and
see
what
it
is
and
so
on
walking
was
still
worse
grizzy
not
only
stood
to
examine
every
article
in
the
shop
windows
but
actually
turned
round
to
observe
every
striking
figure
that
passed
in
short
mary
could
not
conceal
from
herself
that
weak
vulgar
relations
are
an
evil
to
those
whose
taste
and
ideas
are
refined
by
superior
intercourse
but
even
this
discovery
she
did
not
deem
sufficient
to
authorise
her
casting
off
or
neglecting
poor
miss
grizzy
and
she
in
no
degree
relaxed
in
her
patient
attentions
towards
her
even
the
affection
of
her
aunt
which
she
possessed
in
the
highest
possible
degree
far
from
being
an
alleviation
was
only
an
additional
torment
every
meeting
began
with
my
dear
mary
how
did
you
sleep
last
night
did
you
make
a
good
breakfast
this
morning
i
declare
i
think
you
look
a
little
pale
i
sure
i
wish
to
goodness
you
may
have
got
cold
colds
are
going
very
much
about
just
now
one
of
the
maids
in
this
house
has
a
very
bad
cold
i
hope
you
will
remember
to
bathe
your
feet
and
take
some
water
gruel
to
night
and
do
everything
that
redgill
desires
you
honest
man
if
mary
absented
herself
for
a
day
her
salutation
was
my
dear
mary
what
became
of
you
yesterday
i
assure
you
i
was
quite
miserable
about
you
all
day
thinking
which
was
quite
natural
that
something
was
the
matter
with
you
and
i
declare
i
never
closed
my
eyes
all
night
for
thinking
about
you
i
assure
you
if
it
had
not
been
that
i
could
leave
sir
sampson
i
would
have
taken
a
hackney
coach
although
i
know
what
impositions
they
are
and
have
gone
to
beech
park
to
see
what
had
come
over
you
yet
all
this
mary
bore
with
the
patience
of
a
martyr
to
the
admiration
of
lady
maclaughlan
and
the
amazement
of
lady
emily
who
declared
she
could
only
submit
to
be
bored
as
long
as
she
was
amused
on
going
to
milsom
street
one
morning
mary
found
her
aunt
in
high
delight
at
two
invitations
she
had
just
received
for
herself
and
her
niece
the
one
said
she
is
to
dinner
at
pullens
you
ca
remember
her
mother
macfuss
i
daresay
mary
she
was
a
most
excellent
woman
i
assure
you
and
got
all
her
daughters
married
and
i
remember
pullens
when
she
was
flora
macfuss
she
was
always
thought
very
like
her
mother
and
pullens
is
a
most
worthy
man
and
very
rich
and
it
was
thought
at
the
time
a
great
marriage
for
flora
macfuss
for
she
had
no
money
of
her
own
but
her
mother
was
a
very
clever
woman
and
a
most
excellent
manager
and
i
daresay
so
is
pullens
for
the
macfusses
are
all
famous
for
their
management
so
it
will
be
a
great
thing
for
you
you
know
mary
to
be
acquainted
with
mrs
pullens
mary
was
obliged
to
break
in
upon
the
eulogium
on
pullens
by
noticing
the
other
card
this
was
a
subject
for
still
greater
gratulation
this
said
she
is
from
bluemits
and
it
is
for
the
same
day
with
pullens
only
it
is
to
tea
not
to
dinner
to
be
sure
it
will
be
a
great
pity
to
leave
pullens
so
soon
but
then
it
would
be
a
great
pity
not
to
go
to
bluemits
for
i
never
seen
her
and
her
aunt
miss
shaw
would
think
it
very
odd
if
i
was
to
go
back
to
the
highlands
without
seeing
nancy
shaw
now
bluemits
and
at
any
rate
i
assure
you
we
may
think
much
of
being
asked
for
she
is
a
very
clever
woman
and
makes
it
a
point
never
to
ask
any
but
clever
people
to
her
house
so
it
a
very
great
honour
to
be
asked
it
was
an
honour
mary
would
fain
have
dispensed
with
at
another
time
she
might
have
anticipated
some
amusement
from
such
parties
but
at
present
her
heart
was
not
tuned
to
the
ridiculous
and
she
attempted
to
decline
the
invitations
and
get
her
aunt
to
do
the
same
but
she
gave
up
the
point
when
she
saw
how
deeply
grizzy
happiness
for
the
time
being
was
involved
in
these
invitations
and
she
even
consented
to
accompany
her
conscious
as
lady
maclaughlan
said
that
the
poor
creature
required
a
leading
string
and
was
not
fit
to
go
alone
the
appointed
day
arrived
and
mary
found
herself
in
company
with
aunt
grizzy
at
the
mansion
of
pullens
the
fortunate
husband
of
the
miss
flora
macfuss
but
as
grizzy
is
not
the
best
of
biographers
we
must
take
the
liberty
of
introducing
this
lady
to
the
acquaintance
of
our
reader
the
domestic
economy
of
pullens
was
her
own
theme
and
the
theme
of
all
her
friends
and
such
was
the
zeal
in
promulgating
her
doctrines
and
her
anxiety
to
see
them
carried
into
effect
that
she
had
endeavoured
to
pass
it
into
a
law
that
no
preserves
could
be
eatable
but
those
preserved
in
her
method
no
hams
could
be
good
but
those
cured
according
to
her
receipt
no
liquors
drinkable
but
such
as
were
made
from
the
results
of
her
experience
neither
was
it
possible
that
any
linens
could
be
white
or
any
flannels
soft
or
any
muslins
clear
unless
after
the
manner
practised
in
her
laundry
by
her
own
account
she
was
the
slave
of
every
servant
within
her
door
for
her
life
seemed
to
be
one
unceasing
labour
to
get
everything
done
in
her
own
way
to
the
very
blacking
of
pullens
shoes
and
the
brushing
of
coat
but
then
these
heroic
acts
of
duty
were
more
than
repaid
by
the
noble
consciousness
of
a
life
well
spent
in
her
own
estimation
she
was
one
of
the
greatest
characters
that
had
ever
lived
for
to
use
her
own
words
she
passed
nothing
over
she
saw
everything
done
herself
she
trusted
nothing
to
servants
etc
etc
etc
from
the
contemplation
of
these
her
virtues
her
face
had
acquired
an
expression
of
complacency
foreign
to
her
natural
temper
for
after
having
scolded
and
slaved
in
the
kitchen
she
sat
down
to
taste
the
fruits
of
her
labours
with
far
more
elevated
feelings
of
conscious
virtue
than
ever
warmed
the
breast
of
a
hampden
or
a
howard
and
when
she
helped
pullens
to
pie
made
not
by
the
cook
but
by
herself
it
was
with
an
air
of
that
might
have
vied
with
that
of
the
celebrated
jack
horner
upon
a
similar
occasion
in
many
cases
there
might
have
been
merit
in
pullens
doings
narrow
income
the
capricious
taste
of
a
sick
or
a
cross
husband
may
exalt
the
meanest
offices
which
woman
can
render
into
acts
of
virtue
and
even
diffuse
a
dignity
around
them
but
pullens
was
rich
and
and
would
have
been
happy
had
his
cook
been
allowed
to
dress
his
dinner
and
his
barber
his
wig
quietly
in
their
own
way
pullens
therefore
only
sought
the
indulgence
of
her
own
low
inclinations
in
thus
interfering
in
every
menial
department
while
at
the
same
time
she
expected
all
the
gratitude
and
admiration
that
would
have
been
due
to
the
sacrifice
of
the
most
refined
taste
and
elegant
pursuits
but
envy
does
merit
as
its
shade
pursue
as
mrs
pullens
experienced
for
she
found
herself
assailed
by
a
host
of
housekeepers
who
attempted
to
throw
discredit
on
her
various
arts
at
the
head
of
this
association
was
jekyll
whose
arrangements
were
on
a
quite
contrary
plan
the
great
branch
of
science
on
which
pullens
mainly
relied
for
fame
was
her
unrivalled
art
in
keeping
things
long
beyond
the
date
assigned
by
nature
and
one
of
her
was
in
the
middle
of
summer
to
surprise
a
whole
company
with
gooseberry
tarts
made
of
gooseberries
of
the
preceding
year
and
her
triumph
was
complete
when
any
of
them
were
so
polite
as
to
assert
that
they
might
have
passed
upon
them
for
the
fruits
of
the
present
season
another
art
in
which
she
flattered
herself
she
was
unrivalled
was
that
of
making
things
pass
for
what
they
were
not
thus
she
gave
pork
for
lamb
common
fowls
for
turkey
poults
currant
wine
for
champagne
whisky
with
peach
leaves
for
noyau
but
all
these
deceptions
jekyll
piqued
herself
immediately
detecting
and
never
failed
to
point
out
the
difference
and
in
the
politest
manner
to
hint
her
preference
of
the
real
over
the
spurious
many
were
the
wonderful
morsels
with
which
poor
pullens
was
regaled
but
he
had
now
ceased
to
be
surprised
at
anything
that
appeared
on
his
own
table
and
he
had
so
often
heard
the
merit
of
his
housekeeping
extolled
by
herself
that
contrary
to
his
natural
conviction
he
now
began
to
think
it
must
be
true
or
if
he
had
occasionally
any
little
private
misgivings
when
he
thought
of
the
good
dinners
he
used
to
have
in
his
bachelor
days
he
comforted
himself
by
thinking
that
his
lot
was
the
lot
of
all
married
men
who
are
blest
with
active
managing
economical
wives
such
were
and
pullens
and
the
appearance
of
the
house
offered
no
inadequate
idea
of
the
mistress
the
furniture
was
incongruous
and
everything
was
for
pullens
was
a
frequenter
of
sales
and
like
many
other
ladies
never
allowed
a
bargain
to
pass
whether
she
required
the
articles
or
not
her
dress
was
the
same
there
was
always
something
to
wonder
at
caps
that
had
been
bought
for
nothing
because
they
were
a
little
soiled
but
by
being
taken
down
and
washed
and
new
trimmed
turned
out
to
be
just
as
good
as
new
gowns
that
had
been
dyed
turned
cleaned
washed
etc
and
the
great
triumph
was
when
nobody
could
tell
the
old
breadth
from
the
new
the
dinner
was
of
course
bad
the
company
stupid
and
the
conversation
turned
solely
upon
pullens
exploits
with
occasional
attempts
of
jekyll
to
depreciate
the
merits
of
some
of
her
discoveries
at
length
the
hour
of
departure
arrived
to
mary
great
relief
as
she
thought
any
change
must
be
for
the
better
not
so
grizzy
who
was
charmed
and
confounded
by
all
she
had
seen
and
heard
and
tasted
and
all
of
whose
preconceived
ideas
on
the
subjects
of
washing
preserving
had
sustained
a
total
upon
hearing
of
the
superior
methods
practised
by
pullens
well
certainly
mary
you
must
allow
pullens
is
an
astonishing
clever
woman
indeed
i
think
nobody
can
dispute
it
only
think
of
her
never
using
a
bit
of
soap
in
her
house
everything
is
washed
by
steam
to
be
sure
as
mrs
jekyll
said
the
table
linen
was
remarkably
but
no
wonder
considering
it
must
be
a
great
saving
sure
and
she
always
stands
and
sees
it
done
herself
for
there
no
trusting
these
things
to
servants
once
when
she
trusted
it
to
them
they
burned
a
dozen
of
pullens
new
shirts
just
from
carelessness
which
i
sure
was
very
provoking
to
be
sure
as
jekyll
said
if
she
had
used
soap
like
other
people
that
would
have
happened
and
then
it
is
wonderful
how
well
she
contrives
to
keep
things
i
declare
i
ca
think
enough
of
these
green
peas
that
we
had
at
dinner
today
having
been
kept
since
summer
was
a
year
to
be
sure
as
jekyll
said
they
certainly
were
hard
nobody
can
deny
that
but
then
you
know
anything
would
be
hard
that
had
been
kept
since
summer
was
a
year
and
i
sure
i
thought
they
ate
wonderfully
well
considering
and
these
red
currants
too
i
afraid
you
did
taste
them
i
wish
to
goodness
you
had
tasted
them
mary
they
were
sour
and
dry
certainly
as
jekyll
said
but
no
wonder
anything
would
be
sour
and
dry
that
had
been
kept
in
bottles
for
three
years
grizzy
was
now
obliged
to
change
the
current
of
her
ideas
for
the
carriage
had
stopped
at
bluemits
chapter
xxx
it
is
certain
great
knowledge
if
it
be
without
vanity
is
the
most
severe
bridle
of
the
tongue
for
so
have
i
heard
that
all
the
noises
and
prating
of
the
pool
the
croaking
of
frogs
and
toads
is
hushed
and
appeased
upon
the
instant
of
bringing
upon
them
the
light
of
a
candle
or
torch
every
beam
of
reason
and
ray
of
knowledge
checks
the
dissolutions
of
the
tongue
taylor
they
were
received
by
bluemits
with
that
air
of
condescension
which
great
souls
practise
towards
ordinary
mortals
and
which
is
intended
at
one
and
the
same
time
to
encourage
and
to
repel
to
show
the
extent
of
their
goodness
even
while
they
make
or
try
to
make
their
feel
the
immeasurable
distance
which
nature
or
fortune
has
placed
between
them
it
was
with
this
air
of
patronising
grandeur
that
bluemits
took
her
guests
by
the
hand
and
introduced
them
to
the
circle
of
females
already
assembled
bluemits
was
not
an
avowed
authoress
but
she
was
a
professed
critic
a
woman
a
woman
of
great
conversational
powers
and
to
use
her
own
phrase
nothing
but
conversation
was
spoken
in
her
house
her
guests
were
therefore
always
expected
to
be
distinguished
either
for
some
literary
production
or
for
their
taste
in
the
two
ladies
from
scotland
the
land
of
poetry
and
romance
were
consequently
hailed
as
new
stars
in
horizon
no
sooner
were
they
seated
than
bluemits
began
as
i
am
a
friend
to
ease
in
literary
society
we
shall
without
ceremony
resume
our
conversation
for
as
seneca
observes
the
of
life
depends
upon
conversation
i
think
said
miss
graves
it
is
rochefoucault
who
says
great
art
of
conversation
is
to
hear
patiently
and
answer
precisely
a
very
poor
definition
for
so
profound
a
philosopher
remarked
apsley

amiable
author
of
what
the
gigantic
johnson
styles
the
melancholy
and
angry

thoughts
gives
a
nobler
a
more
elevated
and
in
my
humble
opinion
a
juster
explication
of
the
intercourse
of
mind
said
miss
parkins
and
she
repeated
the
following
lines
with
pompous
enthusiasm
speech

mournful

its
better
part

be

a
gift
and
not
an
art
mary
had
been
accustomed
to
read
and
to
reflect
upon
what
she
read
and
to
apply
it
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
valuable
viz
in
enlarging
her
mind
and
cultivating
her
taste
but
she
had
never
been
accustomed
to
prate
or
quote
or
sit
down
for
the
express
purpose
of
displaying
her
acquirements
and
she
began
to
tremble
at
hearing
authors
names
familiar
in
their
mouths
as
household
words
but
grizzy
strong
in
ignorance
was
no
wise
daunted
true
she
heard
what
she
could
not
comprehend
but
she
thought
she
would
soon
make
things
clear
and
she
therefore
turned
to
her
neighbour
on
her
righthand
and
accosted
her
with
my
niece
and
i
are
just
come
from
dining
at
pullens
i
daresay
you
have
heard
of
her
she
was
miss
flora
macfuss
her
father
macfuss
was
a
most
excellent
preacher
and
she
is
a
remarkable
clever
woman
pray
has
she
come
out
or
is
she
simply
esprit
inquired
the
lady
grizzy
was
rather
at
a
loss
and
indeed
to
answer
a
question
put
in
an
unknown
language
would
puzzle
wiser
brains
than
hers
but
grizzy
was
accustomed
to
converse
without
being
able
to
comprehend
and
she
therefore
went
on
her
mother
macfuss
but
she
is
dead
was
a
very
clever
woman
too
i
sure
i
declare
i
do
know
whether
the
doctor
or
her
was
the
cleverest
but
many
people
i
know
think
pullens
beats
them
both
indeed
may
i
ask
in
what
department
she
chiefly
excels
oh
i
really
think
in
everything
for
one
thing
everything
in
her
house
is
done
by
steam
and
then
she
can
keep
everything
i
ca
tell
how
long
just
in
paper
bags
and
bottles
and
she
is
going
to
publish
a
book
with
all
her
receipts
in
it
i
sure
it
will
be
very
interesting
i
beg
ten
thousand
pardons
for
the
interruption
cried
bluemits
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
but
my
ear
was
smote
with
the
sounds
of
and
words
never
fail
to
awaken
a
responsive
chord
in
my
bosom
pray
addressing
grizzy
and
bringing
her
into
the
full
blaze
of
observation
may
i
ask
was
it
of
campbell
these
electric
words
were
spoken
to
you
madam
i
am
sure
i
need
not
apologise
for
my
enthusiasm
you
who
claim
the
proud
distinction
of
being
a
country
woman
need
i
ask
an
acquaintance
all
that
poor
grizzy
could
comprehend
of
this
harangue
was
that
it
was
reckoned
a
great
honour
to
be
acquainted
with
a
campbell
and
chuckling
with
delight
at
the
idea
of
her
own
consequence
she
briskly
replied
oh
i
know
plenty
of
campbells
there
the
campbells
of
mireside
relations
of
ours
and
there
the
campbells
of
blackbrae
married
into
our
family
and
there
the
campbells
of
windlestrae
glen
are
not
very
distant
by
my
mother
side
mary
felt
as
if
perforated
by
bullets
in
all
directions
as
she
encountered
the
eyes
of
the
company
turned
alternately
upon
her
aunt
and
her
but
they
were
on
opposite
sides
of
the
room
therefore
to
interpose
betwixt
grizzy
and
her
assailants
was
impossible
possibly
suggested
dalton
miss
douglas
prefers
the
loftier
strains
of
the
mighty
minstrel
of
the
mountains
to
the
more
polished
periods
of
the
poet
of
the
transatlantic
plain
without
either
a
possibility
or
a
perhaps
said
apsley
the
probability
is
miss
douglas
prefers
the
author
of
the
to
all
the
rest
of
her
poetical
countrymen
where
in
either
walter
scott
or
thomas
campbell
will
you
find
such
lines
as
these
with
their
own
best
blood
shall
drip
thy
gnashing
tooth
and
haggard
lip
pardon
me
madam
said
miss
parkin
but
i
am
of
opinion
you
have
scarcely
given
a
fair
specimen
of
the
powers
of
the
noble
bard
in
question
the
image
here
presented
is
a
familiar
one
gnashing
tooth
and
lip
we
have
all
witnessed
perhaps
some
of
us
may
even
have
experienced
there
is
consequently
little
merit
in
presenting
it
to
the
mind
eye
it
is
easy
comparatively
speaking
to
portray
the
feelings
and
passions
of
our
own
kind
we
have
only
as
dryden
expresses
it
to
descend
into
ourselves
to
find
the
secret
imperfections
of
our
mind
it
is
therefore
in
his
portraiture
of
the
canine
race
that
the
illustrious
author
has
so
far
excelled
all
his
contemporaries
in
fact
he
has
given
quite
a
dramatic
cast
to
his
dogs
and
she
repeated
with
an
air
of
triumph
and
he
saw
the
lean
dogs
beneath
the
wall
hold
the
dead
their
carnival
gorging
and
growling
carcase
and
limb
they
were
too
busy
to
bark
at
him
from
a
tartar
skull
they
had
stripped
the
flesh
as
ye
peel
the
fig
when
its
fruit
is
fresh
and
their
white
tusks
crunched
the
whiter
skull
as
it
slipped
through
their
jaws
when
their
edge
grew
dull
as
they
lazily
mumbled
the
bones
of
the
dead
when
they
scarce
could
rise
from
the
spot
where
they
fed
now
to
enter
into
the
conception
of
a
dog
to
embody
one
self
as
it
were
in
the
person
of
a
brute
to
sympathise
in
its
feelings
to
make
its
propensities
our
own
to
mumble
the
bones
of
the
dead
with
our
own
individual
tusks
pardon
me
madam
but
with
all
due
deference
to
the
genius
of
a
scott
it
is
a
thing
he
has
not
dare
to
attempt
only
the
finest
mind
in
the
universe
as
capable
of
taking
so
bold
a
flight
scott
dogs
madam
are
tame
domestic
animals
mere
human
dogs
if
i
may
say
so
byron
dogs
but
let
them
speak
for
themselves
scalps
were
in
the
wild
dog
maw
the
hair
was
tangled
round
his
jaw
show
me
if
you
can
such
an
image
in
scott
very
fine
certainly
was
here
uttered
by
five
novices
who
were
only
there
as
probationers
consequently
not
privileged
to
go
beyond
a
response
is
it
the
dancing
dogs
they
are
speaking
about
asked
grizzy
but
looks
of
silent
contempt
were
the
only
replies
she
received
i
trust
i
shall
not
be
esteemed
presumptuous
said
miss
graves
or
supposed
capable
of
entertaining
views
of
detracting
from
the
merits
of
the
noble
author
at
present
under
discussion
if
i
humbly
but
firmly
enter
my
caveat
against
the
word
as
constituting
an
innovation
in
our
language
the
purity
of
which
can
not
be
too
strictly
preserved
or
pointedly
enforced
i
am
aware
that
by
some
i
may
be
deemed
unnecessarily
fastidious
and
possibly
christina
queen
of
sweden
might
have
applied
to
me
the
celebrated
observation
said
to
have
been
elicited
from
her
by
the
famed
work
of
the
laborious
french
lexicographer
viz
that
he
was
the
most
troublesome
person
in
the
world
for
he
required
of
every
word
to
produce
its
passport
and
to
declare
whence
it
came
and
whither
it
was
going
i
confess
i
too
for
the
sake
of
my
country
would
wish
that
every
word
we
use
might
be
compelled
to
show
its
passport
attested
by
our
great
lawgiver
samuel
johnson
unquestionably
said
bluemits
purity
of
language
ought
to
be
preserved
inviolate
at
any
price
and
it
is
more
especially
incumbent
to
those
who
exercise
a
sway
over
our
minds
those
are
as
it
were
the
moulds
in
which
our
young
imaginations
are
formed
to
be
the
watchful
guardians
of
our
language
but
i
lament
to
say
that
in
fact
it
is
not
so
and
that
the
aberrations
of
our
vernacular
tongue
have
proceeded
solely
from
the
licentious
use
made
of
it
by
those
whom
we
are
taught
to
reverence
as
the
fathers
of
the
sock
and
lyre
yet
in
familiar
colloquy
i
do
not
greatly
object
to
the
use
of
a
word
occasionally
even
although
unsanctioned
by
the
authority
of
our
mighty
lexicographer
said
a
new
speaker
for
my
part
said
miss
parkins
a
genius
fettered
by
rules
always
reminds
me
of
gulliver
in
the
hairy
bonds
of
the
lilliputians
and
the
sentiment
of
the
elegant
and
enlightened
bard
of
twickenham
is
also
mine
wits
sometimes
may
glorious
offend
and
rise
to
faults
true
critics
dare
not
mend
from
vulgar
bounds
with
brave
disorder
part
and
match
a
grace
beyond
the
reach
of
art
so
it
is
with
the
subject
of
our
argument
a
tamer
genius
than
the
illustrious
byron
would
not
have
dared
to
the
bone
but
where
in
the
whole
compass
of
the
english
language
will
you
find
a
word
capable
of
conveying
the
same
idea
pick
modestly
suggested
one
of
the
novices
in
a
low
key
hoping
to
gain
some
celebrity
by
this
her
first
effort
but
this
dawn
of
intellect
passed
unnoticed
the
argument
was
now
beginning
to
run
high
parties
were
evidently
forming
of
crunchers
and
anticrunchers
and
etymology
was
beginning
to
be
called
for
when
a
thundering
knock
at
the
door
caused
a
cessation
of
hostilities
that
i
flatter
myself
is
my
friend
miss
griffon
said
bluemits
with
an
air
of
additional
importance
and
the
name
was
whispered
round
the
circle
coupled
with
celebrated
authoress
of
the
heart
of
the
moment
etc
etc
is
she
a
authoress
that
is
coming
asked
miss
grizzy
at
the
lady
next
her
and
her
delight
was
great
at
receiving
an
answer
in
the
affirmative
for
grizzy
thought
to
be
in
company
with
an
authoress
was
the
next
thing
to
being
an
authoress
herself
and
like
some
other
people
she
had
a
sort
of
vague
mysterious
reverence
for
everyone
whose
words
had
been
printed
in
a
book
ten
thousand
thousand
pardons
dearest
mrs
bluemits
exclaimed
miss
griffon
as
she
entered
i
fear
a
world
of
intellect
is
lost
to
me
by
this
cruel
delay
then
in
an
audible
whisper
but
i
was
detained
by
my
publisher
he
quite
persecutes
me
to
write
my
of
the
has
had
a
prodigious
run
and
even
my
which
in
fact
cost
me
no
thought
are
amazingly
and
i
actually
had
to
force
my
way
to
you
through
a
legion
of
printer
devils
who
were
lying
in
wait
for
me
with
each
a
sheet
of
my
of
love
the
title
is
most
musical
most
melancholy
said
bluemits
and
conveys
a
perfect
idea
of
what
dryden
terms
sweeping
deluge
of
the
soul
but
i
flatter
myself
we
shall
have
something
more
than
a
name
from
miss
griffon
genius
the
aonian
graces
is
well
known
always
follow
in
her
train
they
have
made
a
great
hole
in
it
then
said
grizzy
officiously
displaying
a
fracture
in
the
train
of
miss
griffon
gown
and
from
thence
taking
occasion
to
deliver
her
sentiments
on
the
propriety
of
people
who
tore
gowns
always
being
obliged
to
mend
them
after
suitable
entreaties
had
been
used
miss
griflon
was
at
last
prevailed
upon
to
favour
the
company
with
some
specimens
of
the
billows
of
love
of
which
we
were
unable
to
procure
copies
and
the
following
sonnet
the
production
of
a
friend
hast
thou
no
note
for
joy
thou
weeping
lyre
doth
yew
and
willow
ever
shade
thy
string
and
melancholy
sable
banners
fling
warring
hosts
of
elegant
desire
how
vain
the
strife
how
vain
the
warlike
gloom
love
arms
are
grief
his
arrows
sighs
and
tears
and
every
moan
thou
an
altar
rears
to
which
his
worshippers
devoutly
come
then
rather

i
pray
thee
try
thy
skill
in
varied
measure
on
a
sprightlier
key
perchance
thy
gayer
tones
light
minstrelsy
may
heal
the
poison
that
thy
plaints
distil
but
much
i
fear
that
joy
is
danger
still
and
joy
like
woe
love
triumph
must
fulfil
this
called
forth
unanimous
applause
delicate
imagery

resounded
from
all
quarters
but
even
intellectual
joys
have
their
termination
and
carriages
and
servants
began
to
be
announced
in
rapid
succession

bluemits
to
the
first
of
her
departing
guests
as
the
clock
struck

it
is
gone
with
its
thorns
and
its

replied
er

with
a
sigh
and
a
farewell
pressure
of
the
hand
another
now
advanced
wilt
thou

it

the

said
apsley
snatching
up
her
tippet
reticule
and
like
the
baseless
fabric
of
a
vision

not
a
wreck
behind
at
once
adieu
adieu
adieu

cried
the
last
of
the
band
as
she
slowly
retreated
bluemits
waved
her
hand
with
a
look
of
tender
reproach
as
she
repeated
an
adieu
should
in
utterance
die
or
if
written
should
faintly
appear
should
be
heard
in
the
sob
of
a
sigh
or
be
seen
in
the
blot
of
a
teal
i
sure
mary
said
grizzy
when
they
were
in
the
carriage
i
expected
when
all
the
ladies
were
repeating
that
you
would
have
repeated
something
too
you
used
to
have
the
hermit
and
all
hymns
by
heart
when
you
was
little
it
a
thousand
pities
i
declare
that
you
should
have
forgot
them
for
i
declare
i
was
quite
affronted
to
see
you
sitting
like
a
stick
and
not
saying
a
word
when
all
the
ladies
were
speaking
and
turning
up
their
eyes
and
moving
their
hands
so
prettily
but
i
sure
i
hope
next
time
you
go
to
bluemits
you
will
take
care
to
learn
something
by
heart
before
you
go
i
sure
i
have
a
very
good
memory
but
i
remember
some
things
and
i
was
very
near
going
to
repeat
to
lochaber
myself
as
we
were
coming
away
and
i
sure
i
wish
to
goodness
i
had
done
it
but
i
suppose
it
would
do
to
go
back
now
and
at
any
rate
all
the
ladies
are
away
and
i
dare
say
the
candles
will
be
out
by
this
time
mary
felt
it
a
relief
to
have
done
with
this
surfeit
of
soul
and
was
of
opinion
that
learning
like
religion
ought
never
to
be
forced
into
conversation
and
that
people
who
only
read
to
talk
of
their
reading
might
as
well
let
it
alone
next
morning
she
gave
so
ludicrous
an
account
of
her
entertainment
that
lady
emily
was
quite
charmed
now
i
begin
to
have
hopes
of
you
said
she
since
i
see
you
can
laugh
at
your
friends
as
well
as
me
not
at
my
friends
i
hope
answered
mary
only
at
folly
call
it
what
you
will
i
only
wish
i
had
been
there
i
should
certainly
have
started
a
controversy
upon
the
respective
merits
of
tom
thumb
and
puss
in
boots
and
so
have
called
them
off
lord
byron
their
pretending
to
measure
the
genius
of
a
scott
or
a
byron
must
have
been
something
like
a
fly
attempting
to
take
the
altitude
of
mont
blanc
how
i
detest
those
idle
disquisitions
about
the
colour
of
a
goat
beard
or
the
blood
of
an
oyster
mary
had
seen
in
douglas
the
effects
of
a
highly
cultivated
understanding
shedding
its
mild
radiance
on
the
path
of
domestic
life
heightening
its
charms
and
softening
its
asperities
with
the
benign
spirit
of
christianity
her
charity
was
not
like
that
of
fox
she
did
not
indulge
herself
in
the
purchase
of
elegant
ornaments
and
then
seated
in
the
easy
chair
of
her
extort
from
her
visitors
money
to
satisfy
the
wants
of
those
who
had
claims
on
her
own
bounty
no
she
gave
a
large
portion
of
her
time
her
thoughts
her
fortune
to
the
most
sacred
of
all
duties
charity
in
its
most
comprehensive
meaning
neither
did
her
knowledge
like
that
of
bluemits
evaporate
in
pedantic
discussion
or
idle
declamation
but
showed
itself
in
the
tenor
of
a
life
and
in
the
graceful
discharge
of
those
duties
which
belonged
to
her
sex
and
station
next
to
goodness
mary
most
ardently
admired
talents
she
knew
there
were
many
of
her
own
sex
who
were
justly
entitled
to
the
distinction
of
literary
fame
her
introduction
to
the
circle
at
bluemits
had
disappointed
her
but
they
were
mere
pretenders
to
the
name
how
different
from
those
described
by
one
no
less
amiable
and
enlightened
herself
let
such
women
as
are
disposed
to
be
vain
of
their
comparatively
petty
attainments
look
up
with
admiration
to
those
contemporary
shining
examples
the
venerable
elizabeth
carter
and
the
blooming
elizabeth
smith
in
them
let
our
young
ladies
contemplate
profound
and
various
learning
chastised
by
true
christian
humility
in
them
let
them
venerate
acquirements
which
would
have
been
distinguished
in
a
university
meekly
softened
and
beautifully
shaded
by
the
exertion
of
every
domestic
virtue
the
unaffected
exercise
of
every
feminine

pope
for
many
months
mary
was
doomed
to
experience
all
the
vicissitudes
of
hope
and
fear
as
she
heard
of
battles
and
sieges
in
which
her
lover
had
a
part
he
omitted
no
opportunity
of
writing
to
her
but
scarcely
had
she
received
the
assurance
of
his
safety
from
himself
when
her
apprehensions
were
again
excited
by
rumours
of
fresh
dangers
he
would
have
to
encounter
and
it
required
all
her
pious
confidence
and
strength
of
mind
to
save
her
from
yielding
to
the
despondency
of
a
naturally
sensitive
heart
but
in
administering
to
the
happiness
of
others
she
found
the
surest
alleviation
to
the
misfortune
that
threatened
herself
and
she
often
forgot
her
own
cares
in
her
benevolent
exertions
for
the
poor
the
sick
and
the
desolate
it
was
then
she
felt
all
the
tenderness
of
that
divine
precept
which
enjoins
love
of
the
creator
as
the
engrossing
principle
of
the
soul
for
oh
the
unutterable
anguish
that
heart
must
endure
which
lavishes
all
its
best
affections
on
a
creature
mutable
and
perishable
as
itself
from
whom
a
thousand
accidents
may
separate
or
estrange
it
and
from
whom
death
must
one
day
divide
it
yet
there
is
something
so
amiable
so
exalting
in
the
fervour
of
a
pure
and
generous
attachment
that
few
have
been
able
to
resist
its
overwhelming
influence
and
it
is
only
time
and
suffering
that
can
teach
us
to
comprehend
the
miseries
that
wait
on
the
excess
even
of
our
virtuous
inclinations
where
these
virtues
aspire
not
beyond
this
transitory
scene
mary
seldom
heard
from
her
mother
or
sister
their
time
was
too
precious
to
be
wasted
on
dull
country
correspondents
but
she
saw
their
names
frequently
mentioned
in
the
newspapers
and
she
flattered
herself
from
the
éclat
with
whioh
the
duchess
seemed
to
be
attended
that
she
had
found
happiness
in
those
pleasures
where
she
had
been
taught
to
expect
it
the
duchess
was
indeed
surrounded
with
all
that
rank
wealth
and
fashion
could
bestow
she
had
the
finest
house
jewels
and
equipages
in
london
but
she
was
not
happy
she
felt
the
draught
bitter
even
though
the
goblet
that
held
it
was
of
gold
it
is
novelty
only
that
can
lend
charms
to
things
in
themselves
valueless
and
when
that
wears
off
the
disenchanted
baubles
appear
in
all
their
native
worthlessness
there
is
even
a
satiety
in
the
free
indulgence
of
wealth
when
that
indulgence
centres
solely
in
self
and
brings
no
general
reflections
along
with
it
so
it
was
with
the
duchess
of
altamont
she
sought
in
the
gratification
of
every
expensive
whim
to
stimulate
the
languid
sense
of
joy
and
by
loading
herself
with
jewels
she
strove
to
still
the
restless
inquietude
of
a
dissatisfied
heart
but
it
is
only
the
vulgar
mind
which
can
long
find
enjoyment
in
the
mere
attributes
of
wealth
in
the
contemplation
of
silk
hangings
and
gilded
chairs
and
splendid
dresses
and
showy
equipages
amidst
all
these
the
mind
of
any
taste
or
refinement
distrusting
asks
if
this
be
joy
and
adelaide
possessed
both
taste
and
refinement
though
her
ideas
had
been
perverted
and
her
heart
corrupted
by
the
false
maxims
early
instilled
into
her
yet
selfish
and
unfeeling
as
she
was
she
sickened
at
the
eternal
recurrence
of
caprices
and
the
bauble
that
had
been
hailed
with
delight
the
one
day
as
a
charmed
amulet
to
dispel
her
ennui
was
the
next
beheld
with
disgust
or
indifference
she
believed
indeed
that
she
had
real
sources
of
vexation
in
the
and
obstinacy
of
her
husband
and
that
had
he
been
otherwise
than
he
was
she
should
then
have
been
completely
happy
she
would
not
acknowledge
even
to
herself
that
she
had
done
wrong
in
marrying
a
man
whose
person
was
disagreeable
to
her
and
whose
understanding
she
despised
while
her
preference
was
decidedly
in
favour
of
another
even
her
style
of
life
was
in
some
respects
distasteful
to
her
yet
she
was
obliged
to
conform
to
it
the
duke
retained
exactly
the
same
notions
of
things
as
had
taken
possession
of
his
brain
thirty
years
before
consequently
everything
in
his
establishment
was
conducted
with
a
regularity
and
uniformity
unknown
to
those
whose
habits
are
formed
on
the
more
eccentric
models
of
the
present
day
or
rather
who
have
no
models
save
those
of
their
own
capricious
tastes
and
inclinations
he
had
an
antipathy
to
balls
concerts
and
masquerades
for
he
did
not
dance
knew
nothing
of
music
and
stil
less
of
but
he
liked
great
dull
dinners
for
there
the
conversation
was
generally
adapted
to
his
capacity
and
it
was
a
pleasure
to
him
to
arrange
the
party
to
look
over
the
bill
of
fare
to
see
all
the
family
plate
displayed
and
to
read
an
account
of
the
grand
dinner
at
the
duke
of
altamont
in
the
morning
post
of
the
following
day
all
this
sounds
very
vulgar
for
the
pastimes
of
a
duke
but
there
are
dukes
as
there
are
gifted
ploughmen
or
any
other
anomalies
the
former
duchess
a
woman
of
high
birth
similar
years
and
kindred
spirit
of
his
own
in
all
matters
of
form
and
was
his
standard
of
female
propriety
and
she
would
have
deemed
it
highly
derogatory
to
her
dignity
to
have
patronised
any
other
species
of
entertainment
than
grand
dinners
and
dull
assemblies
adelaide
had
attempted
with
a
high
hand
at
once
to
overturn
the
whole
system
of
altamont
house
and
had
failed
she
had
declared
her
detestation
of
dinners
and
been
heard
in
silence
she
had
kept
her
room
thrice
when
they
were
given
but
without
success
she
had
insisted
upon
giving
a
ball
but
the
duke
with
the
most
perfect
composure
had
peremptorily
declared
it
must
be
an
assembly
thus
baffled
in
all
her
plans
of
domestic
happiness
the
duchess
would
have
sought
her
pleasures
elsewhere
she
would
have
lived
anywhere
but
in
her
own
house
associated
with
everybody
but
her
own
husband
and
done
everything
but
what
she
had
vowed
to
do
but
even
in
this
she
was
thwarted
the
duke
had
the
same
precise
formal
notions
of
a
lady
conduct
abroad
as
well
as
her
appearance
at
home
and
the
very
places
she
would
have
most
wished
to
go
to
were
those
she
was
expressly
prohibited
from
ever
appearing
at
even
all
that
she
could
have
easily
settled
to
her
own
satisfaction
by
the
simple
apparatus
of
a
separate
establishment
carried
on
in
the
same
house
but
here
too
she
was
foiled
for
his
grace
had
stubborn
notions
on
that
score
also
and
plainly
hinted
that
any
separation
must
be
final
and
decided
and
adelaide
could
not
yet
resolve
upon
taking
so
formidable
a
step
in
the
first
year
of
her
marriage
she
was
therefore
compelled
to
drag
the
chain
by
which
with
her
own
will
she
had
bound
herself
for
life
to
one
she
already
despised
and
detested
and
bound
she
was
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
metaphor
for
though
the
duke
had
not
the
smallest
pleasure
in
the
society
of
his
wife
he
yet
attached
great
ideas
of
propriety
to
their
being
always
seen
together
side
by
side
like
his
sister
lady
matilda
he
had
a
high
reverence
for
appearances
though
he
had
not
her
giving
them
effect
he
had
merely
been
accustomed
to
do
what
he
thought
looked
well
and
gave
him
an
air
of
additional
dignity
he
had
married
aidelaide
because
he
thought
she
had
a
fine
presence
and
would
look
well
as
duchess
of
altamont
and
for
the
same
reason
now
that
she
was
his
wedded
wife
he
thought
it
looked
well
to
be
seen
always
together
he
therefore
made
a
point
of
having
no
separate
engagements
and
even
carried
his
sense
of
propriety
so
far
that
as
regularly
as
the
duchess
carriage
came
to
the
door
the
duke
was
prepared
to
hand
her
in
in
due
form
and
take
his
station
by
her
side
this
alone
would
have
been
sufficient
to
have
embittered
adelaide
existence
and
she
had
tried
every
expedient
but
in
vain
to
rid
herself
of
this
public
display
of
conjugal
duty
she
had
opened
her
landaulet
in
cold
weather
and
shut
it
even
to
the
glasses
in
a
scorching
sun
but
the
duke
was
insensible
to
heat
and
cold
he
was
most
provokingly
healthy
and
she
had
not
even
the
respite
which
an
attack
of
rheumatism
or
toothache
would
have
afforded
as
his
grace
was
not
a
person
of
keen
sensation
this
continual
effort
to
keep
up
appearances
cost
him
little
or
nothing
but
to
the
duchess
nicer
tact
it
was
martyrdom
to
be
compelled
to
submit
to
the
semblance
of
affection
where
there
was
no
reality
ah
nothing
but
a
sense
of
duty
early
instilled
and
practically
enforced
can
reconcile
a
refined
mind
to
the
painful
task
of
bearing
with
meekness
and
gentleness
the
adverse
will
and
opposite
sentiments
of
those
with
whom
we
can
acknowledge
no
feeling
in
common
but
adelaide
possessed
no
sense
of
duty
and
was
a
stranger
to
and
though
she
boasted
refinement
of
mind
yet
it
was
of
that
spurious
sort
which
far
from
elevating
and
purifying
the
heart
tends
only
to
corrupt
and
debase
the
soul
while
it
sheds
a
false
and
dazzling
lustre
upon
those
perishable
graces
which
captivate
the
senses
it
may
easily
be
imagined
the
good
sense
of
the
mother
did
not
tend
to
soothe
the
irritated
feelings
of
the
daughter
lady
juliana
was
indeed
quite
as
much
exasperated
as
the
duchess
at
these
obstacles
thrown
in
the
way
of
her
pleasures
and
the
more
so
as
she
could
not
quite
clearly
comprehend
them
the
of
her
husband
and
the
easy
indolence
of
her
brother
even
had
enabled
her
on
many
occasions
to
get
the
better
of
but
the
obstinacy
of
her
was
invincible
to
all
her
arts
she
could
therefore
only
wonder
to
the
duchess
how
she
could
not
manage
to
get
the
better
of
the
duke
prejudices
against
balls
and
concerts
and
masquerades
it
was
so
excessively
ridiculous
so
perfectly
foolish
not
to
do
as
other
people
did
and
there
was
the
duchess
of
ryston
gave
sunday
concerts
and
lady
oakham
saw
masks
and
even
old
ugly
lady
loddon
had
a
ball
and
the
prince
at
it
how
vastly
provoking
how
unreasonable
in
a
man
of
the
duke
years
to
expect
a
girl
like
adelaide
to
conform
to
all
his
notions
and
then
she
would
wisely
appeal
to
lord
lindore
whether
it
was
not
too
absurd
in
the
duke
to
interfere
with
the
duchess
arrangements
lord
lindore
was
a
frequent
visitor
at
altamont
house
for
the
duke
satisfied
with
his
having
been
once
refused
was
no
wise
jealous
of
him
and
lord
lindore
was
too
quiet
and
refined
in
his
attentions
to
excite
the
attention
of
anyone
so
stupid
and
obtuse
it
was
not
the
least
of
the
duchess
mortifications
to
be
constantly
contrasting
her
former
lover
elegant
captivating
and
her
husband
awkward
insipid
and
dull
as
the
fat
weed
that
rots
on
lethe
shore
lord
lindore
was
indeed
the
most
admired
man
in
london
celebrated
for
his
conquests
his
horses
his
elegance
manner
dress
in
short
in
everything
he
gave
the
tone
but
he
had
too
much
taste
to
carry
anything
to
extreme
and
in
the
midst
of
incense
and
adulation
and
imitation
he
still
retained
that
simple
unostentatious
elegance
that
marks
the
man
of
real
fashion
the
man
who
feels
his
own
consequence
independent
of
all
extraneous
modes
or
fleeting
fashions
there
is
perhaps
nothing
so
imposing
nothing
that
carries
a
greater
sway
over
a
mind
of
any
refinement
than
simplicity
when
we
feel
assured
that
it
springs
from
a
genuine
contempt
of
show
and
ostentation
lord
lindore
was
aware
of
this
and
he
did
not
attempt
to
vie
with
the
duke
of
altamont
in
the
splendour
of
his
equipage
the
richness
of
his
liveries
the
number
of
his
attendants
or
any
of
those
previous
attractions
attractions
on
the
contrary
everything
belonging
to
him
was
of
the
plainest
description
and
except
in
the
beauty
of
his
horses
he
seemed
to
scorn
every
species
of
extravagance
but
then
he
rode
with
so
much
elegance
he
drove
his
curricle
with
such
graceful
ease
as
formed
a
striking
contrast
to
the
formal
duke
sitting
in
his
state
chariot
bras
and
star
and
the
duchess
often
quitted
the
park
where
lord
lindore
was
the
admired
of
all
admirers
mortified
and
ashamed
at
being
seen
in
the
same
carriage
with
the
man
she
had
chosen
for
her
husband
ambition
had
led
her
to
marry
the
duke
and
that
same
passion
now
heightened
her
attachment
for
lord
lindore
for
as
some
one
has
remarked
ambition
is
not
always
the
desire
for
that
which
is
in
itself
excellent
but
for
that
which
is
most
prized
by
others
and
the
handsome
lord
lindore
was
courted
and
caressed
in
circles
where
the
dull
precise
duke
of
altamont
was
wholly
overlooked
months
passed
in
this
manner
and
every
day
added
something
to
adelaide
feelings
of
chagrin
and
disappointment
but
it
was
still
worse
when
she
found
herself
settled
for
a
long
season
at
norwood
abbey
a
dull
magnificent
residence
with
a
vast
unvaried
park
a
profusion
of
sombre
trees
and
a
sheet
of
stillwater
decorated
with
leaden
deities
within
doors
everything
was
in
the
same
style
of
vapid
tasteless
grandeur
and
the
society
was
not
such
as
to
dispel
the
ennui
these
images
served
to
create
lady
matilda
sufton
her
satellite
finch
general
carver
and
a
few
stupid
elderly
lords
and
their
ladies
comprised
the
family
circle
and
the
duchess
experienced
with
bitterness
of
spirit
that
rest
of
heart
and
pleasure
felt
at
home
are
blessings
wealth
can
not
purchase
nor
greatness
command
while
she
sickened
at
the
stupid
the
almost
magnificence
of
her
lot
at
this
period
lord
lindore
arrived
on
a
visit
and
the
daily
hourly
contrast
that
occurred
betwixt
the
elegant
impassioned
lover
and
the
dull
phlegmatic
husband
could
not
fail
of
producing
the
usual
effects
on
an
unprincipled
mind
rousseau
and
goethe
were
studied
french
and
german
sentiments
were
exchanged
till
criminal
passion
was
exalted
into
the
purest
of
all
earthly
emotions
it
were
tedious
to
dwell
upon
the
minute
the
almost
imperceptible
occurrences
that
tended
to
heighten
the
illusion
of
passion
and
throw
an
air
of
false
dignity
around
the
degrading
spells
of
vice
but
so
it
was
that
in
something
less
than
a
year
from
the
time
of
her
marriage
this
victim
of
again
sought
her
happiness
in
the
gratification
of
her
own
headstrong
passions
and
eloped
with
lord
lindore
vainly
hoping
to
find
peace
and
joy
amid
guilt
and
infamy

the
duke
although
not
possessed
of
the
most
delicate
feelings
it
may
be
supposed
was
not
insensible
to
his
dishonour
he
immediately
set
about
taking
the
legal
measures
for
avenging
it
and
damages
were
awarded
which
would
have
the
effect
of
rendering
lord
lindore
for
ever
an
alien
to
his
country
lady
juliana
raved
and
had
hysterics
and
seemed
to
consider
herself
as
the
only
sufferer
by
her
misconduct
at
one
time
adelaide
ingratitude
was
all
her
theme
at
another
it
was
lord
lindore
treachery
and
poor
adelaide
was
everything
that
was
amiable
and
injured
then
it
was
the
obstinacy
for
had
adelaide
got
leave
to
do
as
she
liked
this
never

have
happened
had
she
only
got

she
would

this
was
warmly
resented
by

supported
by

a
denizen
of

park
mary
grief
and
horror
at
her
sister
misconduct
were
proportioned
to
the
nature
of
the
offence
she
considered
it
not
as
how
it
might
affect
herself
or
would
be
viewed
by
the
world
but
as
a
crime
committed
against
the
law
of
god
yet
while
she
the
more
deeply
deplored
it
on
that
account
no
bitter
words
of
condemnation
passed
her
lips
she
thought
with
humility
of
the
superior
advantages
she
had
enjoyed
in
having
principles
of
religion
early
and
deeply
engrafted
in
her
soul
and
that
but
for
these
such
as
her
sister
fate
was
hers
might
have
been
she
felt
for
her
mother
undeserving
as
she
was
of
commiseration
and
strove
by
every
means
in
her
power
to
promote
her
comfort
and
happiness
but
that
was
no
easy
task
lady
juliana
notions
of
comfort
and
happiness
differed
as
widely
from
those
of
her
daughter
as
reason
and
folly
could
possibly
do
she
was
indeed
than
folly
more
a
fool
a
melancholy
fool
without
her
bells
she
still
clung
to
low
vanities
with
as
much
avidity
as
though
she
had
never
experienced
their
insecurity
still
rung
the
same
changes
on
the
joys
of
wealth
and
grandeur
as
if
she
had
had
actual
proof
of
their
unfading
felicity
then
she
recurred
to
the
duke
obstinacy
and
lord

artifices
till
after
having
exhausted
herself
in
invective
against
them
she
concluded
by
comforting
herself
with
the
hope
that
lord
lindore
and
adelaide
would
marry
and
although
it
would
be
a
prodigious
degradation
to
her
and
she
could
not
be
received
at
court
she
might
yet
get
into
very
good
society
in
town
there
were
many
women
of
high
rank
exactly
in
the
same
situation
who
had
been
driven
to
elope
from
their
husbands
and
who
married
the
men
they
liked
and
made
the
best
wives
in
the
world
mary
heard
all
this
in
shame
and
silence
but
lady
emily
wearied
and
provoked
by
her
folly
and
want
of
principle
was
often
led
to
express
her
indignation
and
and
contempt
in
terms
which
drew
tears
from
her
cousin
eyes
mary
was
indeed
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
felt
her
sister
dereliction
with
the
keenest
feelings
of
shame
and
sorrow
all
adelaide
coldness
and
unkindness
had
not
been
able
to
eradicate
from
her
heart
those
sentiments
of
affection
which
seem
to
have
been
entwined
with
our
existence
and
which
with
some
generous
natures
end
but
with
their
being
yes
there
are
ties
that
bind
together
those
of
one
family
stronger
than
those
of
taste
or
choice
or
friendship
or
reason
for
they
enable
us
to
love
even
in
opposition
to
them
all
it
was
understood

fugitives

gone
to
germany
and
after
wonder
and
scandal
were
exhausted
and
a
divorce
obtained
the
duchess
of
altamont
except
to
her
own
family
was
as
though
she
had
never
been
such
is
the
transition
from
from
guilt
to
insignificance
amongst
the
numerous
visitors
who
flocked
to
beech

whether
from
sympathy
curiosity
or
exultation
was
downe
wright
none
of
these
motives
singly
had
brought
that
lady
there
for
her
purpose
was
that
of
giving
what
she
genteelly
termed
some
to
the
pride
a
delicate
mode
of
warfare
in
which
it
must
be
owned
the
female
sex
greatly
excel
downe
wright
had
not
forgiven
the
indignity
of
her
son
having
been
refused
by
mary
which
she
imputed
entirely
to
lady
influence
and
had
from
that
moment
predicted
the
downfall
of
the
whole
pack
as
she
styled
the
family
at
the
same
time
always
expressing
her
wish
that
she
might
be
mistaken
as
she
wished
them
well
god
knows
she
bore
them
no
etc
she
entered
the
at

with
a
countenance
cast
to
a
totally
different
expression
from
that
with
which
she
had
greeted
lady
matilda
sufton
widowhood
melancholy
would
there
have
been
appropriate
here
it
was
insulting
and
accordingly
with
downcast
eyes
and
silent
pressures
of
the
hand
she
saluted
every
member
of
the
family
and
inquired
after
their
healths
with
that
air
of
anxious
solicitude
which
implied
that
if
they
were
all
well
it
was
what
they
ought
not
to
be
lady
emily
quick
tact
was
presently
aware
of
her
design
and
she
prepared
to
take
the
field
against
her
i
had
some
difficulty
in
getting
admittance
to
you
said
downe
wright
the
servant
would
fain
have
denied
you
but
at
such
a
time
i
knew
the
visit
of
a
friend
could
not
fail
of
being
acceptable
so
i
made
good
my
way
in
spite
of
him
i
had
given
orders
to
be
at
home
to
friends
only
returned
lady
emily
as
there
is
no
end
to
the
inroads
of
acquaintances
and
poor
lady
juliana
said
downe
wright
in
a
tone
of
affected
sympathy
i
hope
she
is
able
to
see
her
friends
did
you
not
meet
her
asked
lady
emily
carelessly
she
is
just
gone
to
bath
for
the
purpose
of
securing
a
box
during
the
term
of
engagement
she
would
not
trust
to
du
upon
such
an
occasion
i
vastly
happy
to
hear
she
is
able
for
anything
of
the
kind
in
a
tone
of
vehement
and
overstrained
joy
rather
unsuitable
to
the
occasion
a
look
of
surprise
from
lady
emily
made
her
fear
she
had
overshot
her
mark
she
therefore
as
if
from
delicacy
changed
the
conversation
to
her
own
affairs
she
soon
contrived
to
let
it
be
known
that
her
son
was
going
to
be
married
to
a
scotch
earl
daughter
that
she
was
to
reside
with
them
and
that
she
had
merely
come
to
bath
for
the
purpose
of
letting
her
house
breaking
up
her
establishment
packing
up
her
plate
and
in
short
making
all
those
magnificent
arrangements
which
wealthy
dowagers
usually
have
to
perform
on
a
change
of
residence
at
the
end
of
this
triumphant
declaration
she
added
i
fain
would
have
the
young
people
live
by
themselves
and
let
me
just
go
on
in
my
own
way
but
neither
my
son
nor
lady
grace
would
hear
of
that
although
her
family
are
my
son
nearest
neighbours
and
most
sensible
agreeable
people
they
are
indeed
as
i
said
to
lord
glenallan
a
man
happiness
depends
fully
as
much
upon
his
family
as
upon
herself
mary
was
too
to
suspect
that
downe
wright
could
intend
to
level
innuendoes
but
the
allusion
struck
her
she
felt
herself
blush
and
fearful
downe
wright
would
attribute
it
to
a
wrong
motive
she
hastened
to
join
in
the
eulogium
on
the
benmavis
family
in
general
and
lady
grace
in
particular
lady
benmavis
is
indeed
a
sensible
woman
and
her
daughters
have
been
all
well
brought
up
again
mary
coloured
at
the
emphasis
which
marked
the
sensible
mother
and
the
well
daughters
and
in
some
confusion
she
said
something
about
lady
grace
beauty
she
certainly
is
a
very
pretty
woman
said
downe
wright
with
affected
carelessness
but
what
is
better
she
is
out
of
a
good
nest
for
my
own
part
i
place
little
value
upon
beauty
now
commend
me
to
principles
if
a
woman
is
without
principles
the
less
beauty
she
has
the
better
if
a
woman
has
no
principles
said
lady
emily
i
do
think
it
signifies
a
straw
whether
she
has
beauty
or
not
ugliness
can
never
add
to
one
virtue
i
beg
your
pardon
lady
emily
a
plain
woman
will
never
make
herself
so
conspicuous
in
the
world
as
one
of
your
beauties
then
you
are
of
opinion
wickedness
lies
all
in
the
eye
of
the
world
not
in
the
depths
of
the
heart
now
i
think
the
person
who
cherishes
no
matter
how
secretly
pride
envy
hatred
malice
or
any
other
besetting
sin
must
be
quite
as
criminal
in
the
sight
of
god
as
those
who
openly
indulge
their
evil
propensity
i
go
very
much
by
outward
actions
said
downe
wright
they
are
all
we
have
to
judge
by
but
i
thought
we
were
forbidden
to
judge
one
another
there
no
shutting
people
mouths
lady
emily
no
all
that
is
required
i
believe
is
that
we
should
shut
our
own
mary
thought
the
conversation
was
getting
rather
too
to
be
pleasant
and
tried
to
soften
the
tone
of
it
by
asking
that
most
innocent
question
whether
there
was
any
news
nothing
but
about
battles
and
fightings
i
suppose
answered
downe
wright
i
sure
they
are
to
be
pitied
who
have
friends
or
relations
either
in
army
or
navy
at
present
i
have
reason
to
be
thankful
my
son
is
in
neither
he
was
very
much
set
upon
going
into
one
or
other
but
i
was
always
averse
to
it
for
independent
of
the
danger
they
are
professions
that
spoil
a
man
for
domestic
life
they
lead
to
such
expensive
dissipated
habits
as
quite
ruin
them
for
family
men
i
never
knew
a
military
man
but
what
must
have
his
bottle
of
port
every
day
with
sailors
indeed
it
still
worse
grog
and
tobacco
soon
destroy
them
i
sure
if
i
had
a
daughter
it
would
make
me
miserable
if
she
was
to
take
fancy
to
a
naval
or
military
man
but
as
if
suddenly
recollecting
herself
after
all
perhaps
it
a
mere
prejudice
of
mine
by
no
means
said
lady
emily
there
is
no
prejudice
in
the
matter
what
you
say
is
very
true
they
are
to
be
envied
who
can
contrive
to
fall
in
love
with
a
stupid
idle
man
never
can
experience
any
anxiety
fate
is
fixed
waveless
calm
the
slumber
of
the
dead
is
theirs
as
long
as
they
can
contrive
to
slumber
on
or
at
least
to
keep
their
eyes
shut
is
very
well
they
are
in
no
danger
of
stumbling
till
they
come
to
open
them
and
if
they
are
sufficiently
stupid
themselves
there
is
no
danger
of
their
doing
even
that
the
have
only
to
copy
the
owl
and
they
are
safe
i
quite
agree
with
your
ladyship
said
downe
wright
with
a
well
laugh
a
woman
has
only
not
to
be
a
wit
or
a
genius
and
there
is
no
fear
of
her
not
that
have
that
antipathy
to
a
clever
woman
that
many
people
have
and
especially
the
gentlemen
i
almost
quarrelled
with
headley
the
great
author
day
for
saying
that
he
would
rather
encounter
a
nest
of
wasps
than
a
clever
woman
i
should
most
cordially
have
agreed
with
him
said
lady
emily
with
equal
there
is
nothing
more
insupportable
than
one
of
your
clever
women
so
called
they
are
generally
consequently
vulgar
they
pique
themselves
upon
saying
good
things
there
is
something
in
short
quite
professional
about
them
and
they
would
condescend
to
chat
nonsense
as
you
and
i
are
doing
at
this
moment
oh
not
for
worlds
now
i
think
one
of
the
great
charms
of
life
consists
in
talking
nonsense
good
nonsense
is
an
exquisite
thing
and
is
an
exquisite
thing
to
be
stupid
sometimes
and
to
say
nothing
at
all
now
these
enjoyments
the
clever
woman
must
forego
clever
she
is
and
clever
she
must
be
her
life
must
be
a
greater
drudgery
than
that
of
any
actress
merely
frets
her
hour
upon
the
stage
the
curtain
dropped
she
may
become
as
dull
as
she
chooses
but
the
clever
woman
must
always
stage
it
even
at
her
own
fireside
lady
emily
lindore
is
certainly
the
last
person
from
whom
i
should
have
expected
to
hear
a
panegyric
on
stupidity
said
downe
wright
with
some
bitterness
stupidity
oh
heavens
my
blood
curdles
at
the
thought
of
real
genuine
downright
stupidity
no
i
should
always
like
to
have
the
command
of
intellect
as
well
as
of
money
though
my
taste
or
my
indolence
or
my
whim
perhaps
never
would
incline
me
to
be
always
sparkling
whether
in
wit
or
in
diamonds
was
only
when
i
was
in
the
nursery
that
i
envied
the
good
girl
who
spoke
rubies
and
pearls
now
it
seems
to
me
only
just
better
than
not
spitting
toads
and
vipers
and
she
warbled
a
sprightly
french
to
a
tame
bullfinch
that
flew
upon
her
hand
there
was
an
airy
elegance
in
lady
emily
impertinence
that
seemed
to
throw
downe
wright
coarse
sarcasms
to
an
immeasurable
distance
and
that
lady
was
beginning
to
despair
but
she
was
determined
not
to
give
in
while
she
could
possibly
stand
out
she
accordingly
rallied
her
forces
and
turned
to
mary
so
you
have
lost
your
neighbour
lennox
since
i
was
here
i
think
she
was
an
acquaintance
of
yours
poor
woman
her
death
must
have
been
a
happy
release
to
herself
and
her
friends
she
has
left
no
family
i
believe
quite
aware
of
the
report
of
mary
engagement
with
colonel
lennox
only
one
son
said
mary
with
a
little
emotion
oh
very
true
he
in
the
law
i
think
in
the
army
answered
mary
faintly
that
a
poor
trade
said
downe
wright
and
i
doubt
he
not
have
much
to
mend
it
rose
hall
but
a
poor
property
i
heard
they
might
have
had
a
good
estate
in
scotland
if
it
had
been
for
the
pride
of
the
general
that
would
let
him
change
his
name
for
it
he
thought
it
grander
to
be
a
poor
lennox
than
a
rich
macnaughton
or
some
such
name
it
to
be
hoped
the
son
of
the
same
mind
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
said
lady
emily
tis
a
noble
a
legacy
in
itself
it
one
that
i
am
afraid
will
not
be
easily
turned
into
bank
notes
however
returned
downe
wright
with
a
hearty
laugh
and
then
delighted
to
get
off
with
what
she
called
flying
colours
she
hastily
rose
with
an
exclamation
at
the
lateness
of
the
hour
and
a
remark
how
quickly
time
passed
in
pleasant
company
and
with
friendly
shakes
of
the
hand
withdrew
how
very
insupportable
is
such
a
woman
said
lady
emily
to
mary
who
to
gratify
her
own
malice
says
the
most
cutting
things
to
her
neighbours
and
at
the
same
time
feels
in
the
belief
that
she
is
doing
good
and
yet
hateful
as
she
is
i
blush
to
say
i
have
sometimes
been
amused
by
her
when
it
was
directed
against
people
i
hated
still
more
lady
matilda
sufton
for
example
there
she
certainly
shone
for
hypocrisy
is
always
fair
game
and
yet
the
people
who
love
to
hunt
it
are
never
amiable
you
smile
as
much
as
to
say
here
is
satan
preaching
a
sermon
on
holiness
but
however
satirical
and
intolerant
you
may
think
me
you
must
own
that
i
take
no
delight
in
the
discovery
of
other
people
faults
if
i
want
the
meekness
of
a
christian
at
least
i
do
possess
the
malice
of
a
jew
now
downe
wright
has
a
real
heartfelt
satisfaction
in
saying
malicious
things
and
in
thrusting
herself
into
company
where
she
must
know
she
is
unwelcome
for
the
sole
purpose
of
saying
them
yet
many
people
are
blessed
with
such
blunt
perceptions
that
they
are
not
at
all
aware
of
her
real
character
and
only
wonder
when
she
has
left
them
what
made
them
feel
so
uncomfortable
when
she
was
present
but
she
has
put
me
in
such
a
bad
humour
that
i
must
go
out
of
door
and
apostrophise
the
sun
like
lucifer
do
come
mary
you
will
help
to
dispel
my
chagrin
i
really
feel
as
if
my
heart
had
been
in
a
limekiln
all
its
kingly
feelings
are
so
burnt
up
by
the
malignant
influences
of
downe
wright
while
you
continued
she
as
they
strolled
into
the
gardens
are
as
cool
and
as
sweet
and
as
sorrowful
as
these
violets
gathering
some
still
wet
with
an
april
shower
how
delicious
after
such
a
mental
to
feel
the
pure
air
and
hear
the
birds
sing
and
look
upon
the
flowers
and
blossoms
and
sit
here
and
bask
in
the
sun
from
laziness
to
walk
into
the
shade
you
must
needs
acknowledge
mary
that
spring
in
england
is
a
much
more
amiable
season
than
in
your
ungentle
clime
this
was
the
second
spring
mary
had
seen
set
in
in
england
but
the
first
had
been
wayward
and
backward
as
the
seasons
of
her
native
climate
the
present
was
such
a
one
as
poets
love
to
paint
nature
was
in
all
its
first
freshness
and
beauty
the
ground
was
covered
with
flowers
the
luxuriant
hedgerows
were
white
with
blossoms
the
air
was
impregnated
with
the
odours
of
the
gardens
and
orchards
still
mary
sighed
as
she
thought
of
lochmarlie
its
wild
tangled
woods
with
here
and
there
a
bunch
of
primroses
peeping
forth
from
amidst
moss
and
withered
ferns
its
gurgling
rills
blue
lakes
and
rocks
and
mountains
all
rose
to
view
and
she
felt
that
even
amid
fairer
scenes
and
beneath
brighter
suns
her
heart
would
still
turn
with
fond
regret
to
the
land
of
her
birth
chapter
xxxiii
wondrous
it
is
to
see
in
diverse
mindes
how
diversly
love
doth
his
pageants
play
and
shows
his
power
in
variable
kinds
spenser
but
even
the
charms
of
spring
were
overlooked
by
lady
emily
in
the
superior
delight
she
experienced
at
hearing
that
the
ship
in
which
edward
douglas
was
had
arrived
at
portsmouth
and
the
intelligence
was
soon
followed
by
his
own
arrival
at
beech
park
he
was
received
by
her
with
rapture
and
by
mary
with
the
tenderest
emotion
lord
courtland
was
always
glad
of
an
addition
to
the
family
party
and
even
lady
juliana
experienced
something
like
emotion
as
she
beheld
her
son
now
the
exact
image
of
what
his
father
had
been
twenty
years
before
edward
douglas
was
indeed
a
perfect
model
of
youthful
beauty
and
possessed
of
all
the
high
spirits
and
happy
which
can
only
charm
at
that
early
period
he
loved
his
profession
and
had
already
distinguished
himself
in
it
he
was
handsome
brave
and
but
he
was
not
clever
and
mary
felt
some
solicitude
as
to
the
permanency
of
of
lady
emily
attachment
to
him
but
lady
emily
to
the
defects
of
the
whole
world
seemed
happily
blind
to
those
of
her
lover
and
when
even
mary
spirits
were
almost
exhausted
by
his
noisy
rattle
lady
emily
charmed
and
exhilarated
entered
into
all
his
practical
jokes
and
boyish
frolics
with
the
greatest
delight
she
soon
perceived
what
was
passing
in
mary
mind
i
see
perfectly
well
what
you
think
of
my
for
edward
said
she
one
day
i
can
tell
you
exactly
what
was
passing
in
your
thoughts
just
now
you
were
thinking
how
strange
how
passing
strange
it
is
that
i
who
am
false
modesty
avaunt
certainly
cleverer
than
edward
should
yet
be
so
partial
to
him
and
that
my
lynx
eyes
should
have
failed
to
discover
in
him
faults
which
with
a
single
glance
i
should
have
detected
in
others
now
ca
you
guess
what
renders
even
these
very
faults
so
attractive
to
me
the
old
story
i
suppose
said
mary
love
not
at
all
love
might
blind
me
to
his
faults
altogether
and
then
my
case
would
be
indeed
hopeless
were
i
living
in
the
belief
that
i
was
loving
a
piece
of
perfection
a
sort
of
apollo
belvidere
in
mind
as
well
as
in
person
now
so
far
from
that
i
could
reckon
you
up
a
whole
catalogue
of
his
faults
and
nevertheless
i
love
him
with
my
whole
heart
faults
and
all
in
the
first
place
they
are
the
faults
with
which
i
have
been
familiar
from
infancy
and
therefore
they
possess
a
charm
to
my
shame
be
it
said
greater
than
other
people
virtues
would
have
to
me
they
come
over
my
fancy
like
some
snatch
of
an
old
nursery
song
which
one
loves
to
hear
in
defiance
of
taste
and
reason
merely
because
it
is
something
that
carries
us
back
to
those
days
which
whatever
they
were
in
reality
always
look
bright
and
sunny
in
retrospection
in
the
second
place
his
faults
are
real
genuine
natural
faults
and
in
this
age
of
affectation
how
refreshing
it
is
to
meet
with
even
a
natural
fault
i
grant
you
edward
talks
absurdly
and
asks
questions
faire
dresser
les
of
a
bluemits
but
that
amuses
me
for
his
ignorance
is
not
the
ignorance
of
vulgarity
or
stupidity
but
the
ignorance
of
a
light
head
and
a
merry
heart
of
one
in
short
whose
understanding
has
been
at
sea
when
other
were
at
school
his
certainly
would
not
do
to
be
printed
but
then
they
make
me
laugh
a
great
deal
more
than
if
they
were
better
for
he
is
always
and
original
and
i
prefer
an
in
indifferent
original
any
day
to
a
good
copy
how
it
shocks
me
to
hear
people
recommending
to
their
children
to
copy
such
a
person
manners
a
copied
manner
how
insupportable
the
servile
imitator
of
a
set
pattern
how
despicable
no
i
would
rather
have
edward
in
all
the
freshness
of
his
own
faults
rather
than
in
the
faded
semblance
of
another
proprieties
mary
agreed
to
the
truth
of
her
cousin
observations
in
some
respects
though
she
could
not
help
thinking
that
love
had
as
much
to
say
in
her
case
as
in
most
others
for
if
it
did
not
blind
her
to
her
faults
it
certainly
made
her
much
more
tolerant
of
them
edward
was
in
truth
at
times
almost
provokingly
boyish
and
unthinking
and
possessed
a
flow
of
animal
spirits
as
inexhaustible
as
they
were
sometimes
overpowering
but
she
flattered
herself
time
would
subdue
them
to
a
more
rational
tone
and
she
longed
for
his
having
the
advantages
of
colonel
lennox
society
not
by
way
of
pattern
as
lady
emily
expressed
it
but
that
he
might
be
gradually
led
to
something
of
more
refinement
from
holding
intercourse
with
a
superior
mind
and
she
obtained
her
wish
sooner
than
she
had
dared
to
hope
for
it
that
battle
was
fought
which
decided
the
fate
of
europe
and
turned
so
many
swords
into
ploughshares
and
mary
seemed
now
touching
the
pinnacle
of
happiness
when
she
saw
her
lover
restored
to
her
he
had
gained
additional
renown
in
the
bloody
field
of
waterloo
and
more
fortunate
than
others
his
military
career
had
terminated
both
gloriously
and
happily
if
mary
had
ever
distrusted
the
reality
of
his
affection
all
her
doubts
were
now
at
an
end
she
saw
she
was
beloved
with
all
the
truth
and
ardour
of
a
noble
ingenuous
mind
too
upright
to
deceive
others
too
enlightened
to
deceive
itself
all
reserve
betwixt
them
was
now
at
an
end
and
secure
in
mutual
affection
nothing
seemed
to
oppose
itself
to
their
happiness
colonel
lennox
fortune
was
small
but
such
as
it
was
it
seemed
sufficient
for
all
the
purposes
of
rational
enjoyment
both
were
aware
that
wealth
is
a
relative
thing
and
that
the
positively
rich
are
not
those
who
have
the
largest
possessions
but
those
who
have
the
fewest
vain
or
selfish
desires
to
gratify
from
these
they
were
happily
exempt
both
possessed
too
many
resources
in
their
own
minds
to
require
the
stimulus
of
spending
money
to
rouse
them
into
enjoyment
or
give
them
additional
importance
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
above
all
both
were
too
thoroughly
christian
in
their
principles
to
murmur
at
any
sacrifices
or
privations
they
might
have
to
endure
in
the
course
of
their
earthly
pilgrimage
but
lady
juliana
weak
worldly
mind
saw
things
in
a
very
different
light
and
when
colonel
lennox
as
a
matter
of
form
applied
to
her
for
her
consent
to
their
union
he
received
a
positive
and
angry
refusal
she
declared
she
never
would
consent
to
any
daughter
of
hers
making
so
foolish
so
very
unsuitable
a
marriage
and
then
sending
for
mary
she
charged
her
in
the
most
peremptory
manner
to
break
of
all
intercourse
with
colonel
lennox
poor
mary
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
and
amazement
at
this
new
display
of
her
mother
tyranny
and
injustice
and
used
all
the
powers
of
reasoning
and
entreaty
to
alter
her
sentiments
but
in
vain
since
adelaide
elopement
lady
juliana
had
been
much
in
want
of
some
subject
to
occupy
her
mind
something
to
excite
a
sensation
and
give
her
something
to
complain
of
and
talk
about
and
put
her
in
a
bustle
and
make
her
angry
and
alarmed
and
and
in
short
all
the
things
which
a
fool
is
fond
of
being
although
mary
had
little
hopes
of
being
able
to
prevail
by
any
efforts
of
reason
she
yet
tried
to
make
her
mother
comprehend
the
nature
of
her
engagement
with
colonel
lennox
as
of
a
sacred
nature
and
too
binding
ever
to
be
dissolved
but
lady
juliana
wrath
blazed
forth
with
redoubled
violence
at
the
very
mention
of
an
engagement
she
had
never
heard
of
anything
so
improper
colonel
lennox
must
be
a
most
unprincipled
man
to
lead
her
daughter
into
an
engagement
unsanctioned
by
her
and
she
had
acted
in
the
most
improper
manner
in
allowing
herself
to
form
an
attachment
without
the
consent
of
those
who
had
the
best
title
to
dispose
of
her
the
person
who
could
act
thus
was
not
fit
to
be
trusted
and
in
future
it
would
be
necessary
for
her
to
have
her
constantly
under
her
own
eye
mary
found
her
candour
had
therefore
only
reduced
her
to
the
alternative
of
either
openly
rebelling
or
of
submitting
to
be
talked
at
and
watched
and
guarded
as
if
she
had
been
detected
in
carrying
on
some
improper
clandestine
intercourse
but
she
submitted
to
all
the
restrictions
that
were
imposed
and
the
torments
that
were
inflicted
if
not
with
the
heroism
of
a
martyr
at
least
with
the
meekness
of
one
for
no
murmur
escaped
her
lips
she
was
only
anxious
to
conceal
from
others
the
extent
of
her
mother
folly
and
injustice
and
took
every
opportunity
of
entreating
colonel
lennox
silence
and
forbearance
it
required
indeed
all
her
influence
to
induce
him
to
submit
patiently
to
the
treatment
he
experienced
lady
juliana
had
so
often
repeated
to
mary
that
it
was
the
greatest
presumption
in
colonel
lennox
to
aspire
to
a
daughter
of
hers
that
she
had
fairly
talked
herself
into
the
belief
that
he
was
all
she
asserted
him
to
be
a
man
of
neither
birth
nor
fortune
certainly
a
scotsman
from
his
name
consequently
having
thousands
of
poor
cousins
and
vulgar
relations
of
every
description
and
she
was
determined
that
no
daughter
of
hers
should
ever
marry
a
man
whose
family
connections
she
knew
nothing
about
she
had
suffered
a
great
deal
too
much
from
her
mary
father
low
relations
ever
to
run
the
risk
of
anything
of
the
same
kind
happening
again
in
short
she
at
length
made
it
out
clearly
to
her
own
satisfaction
that
colonel
lennox
was
scarcely
a
gentleman
and
she
therefore
considered
it
as
her
duty
to
treat
him
on
every
occasion
with
the
most
marked
rudeness
colonel
lennox
pitied
her
folly
too
much
to
be
hurt
by
her
and
malevolence
but
he
could
scarcely
reconcile
it
to
his
notions
of
duty
that
mary
superior
mind
should
submit
to
the
thraldom
of
one
who
evidently
knew
not
good
from
evil
lady
emily
was
so
much
engrossed
by
her
own
affairs
that
for
some
time
all
this
went
on
unnoticed
by
her
at
length
she
was
struck
with
dejection
and
observed
that
colonel
lennox
seemed
also
dispirited
but
imputing
it
to
a
lover
quarrel
she
laughingly
taxed
them
with
it
although
mary
could
suppress
the
cause
of
her
uneasiness
she
was
too
ingenuous
to
deny
it
and
being
pressed
by
her
cousin
she
at
length
disclosed
to
her
the
cause
of
her
sorrow
colonel
lennox
and
you
have
behaved
like
two
fools
said
she
at
the
end
of
her
cousin
communication
what
could
possibly
instigate
you
to
so
absurd
an
act
as
that
of
asking
lady
juliana
consent
you
surely
might
have
known
that
the
person
who
is
never
consulted
about
anything
will
invariably
start
difficulties
to
everything
and
that
people
who
are
never
accustomed
to
be
even
listened
to
get
quite
unmanageable
when
appealed
to
lady
juliana
gave
an
immediate
assent
to
lord
proposals
because
she
was
the
first
person
consulted
about
them
and
besides
she
had
a
sort
of
an
instinctive
knowledge
that
it
would
create
a
sensation
and
make
her
of
consequence
in
short
she
was
to
act
in
a
sort
of
triple
capacity
as
parent
lover
and
bride
here
on
the
contrary
she
was
aware
that
her
consent
would
stand
as
a
mere
cipher
and
once
given
would
never
be
more
heard
of
liberty
of
opinion
is
an
attitude
many
people
quite
lose
themselves
in
when
once
they
attempt
to
think
it
makes
confusion
worse
confounded
so
it
is
much
better
to
take
that
labour
off
their
hands
and
settle
the
matter
for
them
it
would
have
been
quite
time
enough
to
have
asked
lady
juliana
consent
after
the
thing
was
over
or
at
any
rate
the
minute
before
it
was
to
take
place
i
would
not
even
have
allowed
her
time
for
a
flood
of
tears
or
a
fit
of
hysterics
and
now
that
your
duty
has
brought
you
to
this
even
my
genius
is
a
a
loss
how
to
extricate
you
gretna
green
might
have
been
advisable
and
that
would
have
accorded
with
your
notions
of
duty
that
would
have
been
following
your
mamma
own
footsteps
but
it
is
become
too
vulgar
an
exploit
i
read
of
a
hatter
apprentice
having
carried
off
a
grocer
heiress
day
what
do
you
purpose
doing
yourself
to
try
the
effect
of
patience
and
submission
said
mary
rather
than
openly
set
at
defiance
one
of
the
most
sacred
duties
the
obedience
of
a
child
to
a
parent
besides
i
could
not
possibly
be
happy
were
i
to
marry
under
such
circumstances
you
have
much
too
nice
a
conscience
said
lady
emily
and
yet
i
could
scarcely
wish
you
otherwise
than
you
are
what
an
angel
you
are
to
behave
as
you
do
to
such
a
mother
with
such
sweetness
and
gentleness
and
even
respect
ah
they
know
little
of
human
nature
who
think
that
to
perform
great
actions
one
must
necessarily
be
a
great
character
so
far
from
that
i
now
see
there
may
be
much
more
real
greatness
of
mind
displayed
in
the
quiet
tenor
of
a
woman
life
than
in
the
most
brilliant
exploits
that
ever
were
performed
by
man
methinks
i
myself
could
help
to
storm
a
city
but
to
rule
my
own
spirit
is
a
task
beyond
me
what
a
pity
it
is
you
and
i
can
not
change
places
here
am
i
languishing
for
a
little
opposition
to
my
love
my
marriage
will
be
quite
an
insipid
affair
i
yawn
already
to
think
of
it
can
anything
be
more
disheartening
to
a
young
couple
anxious
to
signalise
their
attachment
in
the
face
of
the
whole
world
than
to
be
allowed
to
take
their
own
way
conceive
my
vexation
at
being
told
by
papa
this
morning
that
he
had
not
the
least
objection
to
edward
and
me
marrying
whenever
we
pleased
although
he
thought
we
might
both
have
done
better
but
that
was
our
own
affair
not
his
that
he
thought
edward
a
fine
good
humoured
fellow
excessively
amusing
hoped
he
would
get
a
ship
some
day
although
he
had
no
interest
whatever
in
the
admiralty
was
sorry
he
could
not
give
us
any
money
but
hoped
we
should
remain
at
beech
park
as
long
as
we
liked
i
really
feel
quite
flat
with
all
these
dull
affirmations
what
you
had
rather
have
been
locked
up
in
a
tower
wringing
your
hands
at
the
height
of
the
windows
the
thickness
of
the
walls
and
so
forth
said
mary
no
i
should
never
have
done
anything
so
like
a
washerwoman
as
to
wring
my
hands
though
i
might
like
some
heroines
have
fallen
to
work
in
a
regular
by
examining
the
lock
of
the
door
and
perhaps
have
succeeded
in
picking
it
but
alas
i
live
in
degenerate
days
oh
that
i
had
been
born
the
persecuted
daughter
of
some
ancient
baron
bold
instead
of
the
spoiled
child
of
a
good
natured
modern
earl
heavens
to
think
that
i
must
tamely
abjectly
submit
to
be
married
in
the
presence
of
all
my
family
even
in
the
very
parish
church
oh
what
detractions
from
the
brilliancy
of
my
star
in
spite
of
her
levity
lady
emily
was
seriously
interested
in
her
cousin
affairs
and
tried
every
means
of
obtaining
lady
consent
but
lady
juliana
was
become
more
unmanageable
than
ever
her
temper
always
bad
was
now
soured
by
chagrin
and
disappointment
into
something
if
possible
still
worse
and
lady
emily
authority
had
no
longer
any
control
over
her
even
the
threat
of
producing
aunt
grizzy
to
a
brilliant
assembly
had
now
lost
its
effect
redgill
was
the
only
auxiliary
she
possessed
in
the
family
and
he
most
cordially
joined
he
in
condemning
miss
mary
obstinacy
and
infatuation
what
could
she
see
in
a
man
with
such
an
insignificant
bit
of
property
a
mere
nest
for
blackbirds
and
linnets
and
such
sort
of
vermin
not
a
morsel
of
any
sort
of
game
on
his
grounds
while
at
glenallan
he
had
been
credibly
informed
such
was
the
abundance
that
the
deer
had
been
seen
stalking
and
the
flying
past
the
very
door
but
the
doctor
indignation
was
suddenly
suspended
by
a
fit
of
apoplexy
from
which
however
he
rallied
and
passed
it
off
for
the
present
as
a
sort
of
vertigo
in
consequence
of
the
shock
he
had
received
at
hearing
of
miss
misconduct
at
length
even
colonel
lennox
forbearance
was
exhausted
and
health
and
spirits
were
sinking
beneath
the
conflict
she
had
to
maintain
when
a
sudden
revolution
in
lady
juliana
plans
caused
also
a
revolution
in
her
sentiments
this
was
occasioned
by
a
letter
from
adelaide
now
lady
lindore
it
was
evidently
written
under
the
influence
of
melancholy
and
discontent
and
as
lady
emily
said
nothing
could
be
a
stronger
proof
of
poor
adelaide
wretchedness
than
her
expressing
a
wish
that
her
mother
should
join
her
in
the
south
of
france
where
she
was
going
on
account
of
her
health
adelaide
was
indeed
one
of
the
many
melancholy
proofs
of
the
effects
of
headstrong
passions
and
perverted
principles
lord
lindore
had
married
her
from
a
point
of
honour
and
although
he
possessed
too
much
refinement
to
treat
her
ill
yet
his
indifference
was
not
the
less
cutting
to
a
spirit
haughty
as
hers
like
many
others
she
had
vainly
imagined
that
in
renouncing
virtue
itself
for
the
man
she
loved
she
was
for
ever
ensuring
his
boundless
gratitude
and
adoration
and
she
only
awoke
from
her
delusive
dream
to
find
herself
friendless
in
a
foreign
land
an
outcast
from
society
an
object
of
indifference
even
to
him
for
whom
she
had
abandoned
all
but
lady
juliana
would
see
nothing
of
all
this
she
was
charmed
at
what
she
termed
this
proof
of
her
daughter
affection
in
wishing
to
have
her
with
her
and
the
prospect
of
going
abroad
seemed
like
a
vision
of
paradise
to
her
instant
preparations
were
made
for
her
departure
and
in
the
bustle
attendant
on
them
mary
and
her
affairs
sank
into
utter
insignificance
indeed
she
seemed
rather
anxious
to
get
her
disposed
of
in
any
way
that
might
prevent
her
interfering
with
her
own
plans
and
a
consent
to
her
marriage
such
as
it
was
was
easily
obtained
marry
whom
you
please
said
she
only
remember
i
am
not
responsible
for
the
consequences
i
have
always
told
you
what
a
wretched
thing
a
is
therefore
you
are
not
to
blame
me
for
your
future
misery
mary
readily
subscribed
to
the
conditions
but
as
she
embraced
her
mother
at
parting
she
timidly
whispered
a
hope
that
she
would
ever
consider
her
house
as
her
home
a
smile
of
contempt
was
the
only
reply
she
received
and
they
parted
never
more
to
meet
lady
juliana
found
foreign
manners
and
principles
too
congenial
to
her
tastes
ever
to
return
to
britain
chapter
xxxiv
o
most
gentle
jupiter
what
tedious
homily
of
love
have
you
wearied
your
parishioners
withal
and
never
cried
patience
good
people
you
like
the
only
obstacle
to
her
union
thus
removed
mary
thought
she
might
now
venture
to
let
her
aunt
grizzy
into
the
secret
and
accordingly
with
some
little
embarrassment
she
made
the
disclosure
of
the
mutual
attachment
subsisting
between
colonel
lennox
and
herself
grizzy
received
the
communication
with
all
the
astonishment
which
ladies
usually
experience
upon
being
made
acquainted
with
a
marriage
which
they
had
not
had
the
prescience
to
foresee
and
foretell
or
even
one
which
they
had
for
common
and
natural
as
the
event
seems
to
be
it
is
one
which
perhaps
in
no
instance
ever
took
place
without
occasioning
the
greatest
amazement
to
some
one
individual
or
another
and
it
will
also
be
generally
found
that
either
the
good
or
the
bad
fortune
of
one
or
other
of
the
parties
is
the
subject
of
universal
wonder
in
short
a
marriage
which
excites
no
surprise
pity
or
indignation
must
be
something
that
has
never
yet
been
witnessed
on
the
face
of
this
round
world
it
is
greatly
to
be
feared
none
of
my
readers
will
sympathise
in
the
feelings
of
the
good
spinster
on
this
occasion
as
she
poured
them
forth
in
the
following
or
strain
well
mary
i
declare
i
perfectly
confounded
with
all
you
have
been
telling
me
i
sure
i
never
heard
the
like
of
it
it
seems
but
the
day
since
you
began
your
sampler
and
it
looks
just
like
yesterday
since
your
father
and
mother
were
married
and
such
a
work
as
there
was
at
your
nursing
i
sure
your
poor
grandfather
was
out
of
all
patience
about
it
and
now
to
think
that
you
are
going
to
be
married
not
but
what
it
a
thing
we
all
expected
for
there
no
doubt
england
the
place
for
young
women
to
get
husbands
we
always
said
that
you
know
not
but
what
i
dare
say
you
might
have
been
married
too
if
you
had
stayed
in
the
highlands
and
to
a
real
highlander
too
which
of
course
would
have
been
still
better
for
us
all
for
it
will
be
a
sad
thing
if
you
are
obliged
to
stay
in
england
mary
but
i
hope
there
no
chance
of
that
you
know
colonel
lennox
can
easily
sell
his
place
and
buy
an
estate
in
the
highlands
there
a
charming
property
i
know
to
be
sold
just
now
that
with
glenfern
to
be
sure
it
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
hill
there
no
denying
that
but
then
there
i
ca
tell
you
how
many
thousand
acres
of
fine
muir
for
shooting
and
i
daresay
colonel
lennox
is
a
keen
sportsman
and
they
say
a
great
deal
of
it
might
be
very
much
improved
we
must
really
inquire
after
it
mary
and
you
must
speak
to
colonel
lennox
about
it
for
you
know
such
a
property
as
that
may
be
snapped
up
in
a
minute
mary
assented
to
all
that
was
said
and
grizzy
proceeded
i
wonder
you
never
brought
colonel
lennox
to
see
us
mary
i
sure
he
must
think
it
very
odd
to
be
sure
sir
sampson
situation
is
some
excuse
but
at
any
rate
i
wonder
you
never
spoke
about
him
we
all
found
out
your
aunt
bella
attachment
from
the
very
first
just
from
her
constantly
speaking
about
major
and
the
militia
and
we
had
a
good
guess
of
betsy
too
from
the
day
her
face
turned
so
red
after
giving
captain
for
her
toast
but
you
have
really
kept
yours
very
close
for
i
declare
i
never
once
suspected
such
a
thing
i
wonder
if
that
was
colonel
lennox
that
i
saw
you
part
with
at
the
door
one
day
tall
and
with
brown
hair
and
a
bluecoat
i
asked
lady
maclaughlan
if
she
knew
who
it
was
and
she
said
it
was
admiral
benbow
but
i
think
she
must
have
been
mistaken
for
i
daresay
now
it
was
just
colonel
lennox
lennox
i
sure
i
should
be
able
to
remember
something
about
somebody
of
that
name
but
my
memory
not
so
good
as
it
used
to
be
for
i
have
so
many
things
you
know
to
think
about
with
sir
sampson
that
i
declare
sometimes
my
head
quite
confused
yet
i
think
always
something
about
them
i
wish
to
goodness
lady
maclaughlan
was
come
from
the
dentist
that
i
might
consult
her
about
it
for
of
course
do
nothing
without
consulting
all
your
friends
i
know
you
too
much
sense
for
that
an
here
sir
sampson
coming
it
will
be
a
fine
piece
of
news
to
tell
him
sir
sampson
having
been
now
wheeled
in
by
the
still
active
philistine
and
properly
arranged
with
the
assistance
of
miss
grizzy
she
took
her
usual
station
by
the
side
of
his
easy
chair
and
began
to
shout
into
his
ear
here
my
niece
mary
sir
sampson
you
remember
her
when
she
was
little
i
daresay
you
know
you
used
to
call
her
the
fairy
of
lochmarlie
and
i
sure
we
all
thought
for
long
she
would
have
been
a
perfect
fairy
she
was
so
little
but
she
tall
enough
now
you
see
and
she
going
to
be
married
to
a
fine
young
man
none
of
us
know
him
yet
but
i
think
i
must
have
seen
him
and
at
any
rate
i
to
see
him
and
you
see
him
too
sir
sampson
for
mary
is
to
bring
him
to
call
here
and
he
tell
you
all
about
the
battle
of
waterloo
and
the
highlanders
for
he
half
a
highlander
too
and
i
certain
he
buy
the
dhuanbog
estate
and
then
when
my
niece
mary
marries
colonel
lennox
lennox
repeated
sir
sampson
his
little
dim
eyes
kindling
at
the
name
who
talks
of
lennox
i
i
i
wo
suffer
it
where
my
lady
lennox
he
a
scoundrel
you
sha
marry
a
lennox
turning
to
grizzy
call
philistine
and
my
lady
and
his
agitation
was
so
great
that
even
grizzy
although
accustomed
for
forty
years
to
witness
similar
ebullitions
became
alarmed
you
see
it
all
for
fear
of
my
marrying
whispered
she
to
mary
i
sure
such
a
disinterested
attachment
it
impossible
for
me
ever
to
repay
it
then
turning
to
sir
sampson
she
sought
to
soothe
his
perturbation
by
assurances
that
it
was
not
her
but
her
niece
mary
that
was
going
to
be
married
to
colonel
lennox
but
in
vain
sir
sampson
quivered
and
panted
and
muttered
and
the
louder
grizzy
screamed
out
the
truth
the
more
his
irritation
increased
recourse
was
now
had
to
philistine
and
mary
thoroughly
ashamed
of
the
éclat
attending
the
disclosure
of
her
secret
and
finding
she
could
be
of
no
use
stole
away
in
the
midst
of
miss
grizzy
endless
but
as
she
descended
the
stairs
she
still
heard
the
same
assurance
resounding
i
can
assure
you
sir
sampson
it
not
me
but
my
niece
mary
that
going
to
be
married
to
colonel
lennox
etc
on
returning
to
beech
park
she
said
nothing
of
what
had
passed
either
to
lady
emily
or
colonel
lennox
aware
of
the
amusement
it
would
furnish
to
both
and
she
felt
that
her
aunt
required
all
the
dignity
with
which
she
could
invest
her
before
presenting
her
to
her
future
nephew
the
only
delay
to
her
marriage
now
rested
with
herself
but
she
was
desirous
it
should
take
place
under
the
roof
which
had
sheltered
her
infancy
and
sanctioned
by
the
presence
of
those
whom
she
had
ever
regarded
as
her
parents
lady
emily
colonel
lennox
and
her
brother
had
all
endeavoured
to
combat
this
resolution
but
in
vain
and
it
was
therefore
settled
that
she
should
remain
to
witness
the
union
of
her
brother
and
her
cousin
and
then
return
to
lochmarlie
but
all
mary
preconceived
plans
were
threatened
with
a
downfall
by
the
receipt
of
the
following
letter
from
miss
jacky
glenfern
castle
it
impossible
for
to
express
to
the
grief
amazement
and
with
we
are
filled
at
the
distressing
the
disclosure
that
has
taken
concerning
you
our
most
friend
miss
oh
mary
have
you
us
all
what
a
plunged
into
our
hearts
your
how
my
bleeds
her
what
a
difficult
part
she
to
act
and
at
her
of
life
with
her
acute
with
her
devoted
the
of
what
a
and
a
your
oh
mary
i
again
repeat
how
you
deceived
us
yet
not
imagine
i
mean
to
you
much
much
of
the
blame
is
to
the
errors
of
education
at
the
even
these
no
justification
of
your
the
present
occasion
you
are
now
i
lament
to
say
it
to
that
time
of
when
ought
to
know
is
right
or
where
you
entertain
doubts
you
ought
unquestionably
to
to
those
you
be
certain
well
qualified
to
direct
you
instead
that
you
have
a
diametrically
opposite
a
plan
which
have
in
your
destruction
oh
mary
can
not
too
how
have
deceived
us
all
from
no
those
of
miss
i
have
believed
i
have
heard
videlicet
that
you
oh
mary
have
for
many
many
months
been
carrying
on
a
clandestine
a
man
unknown
unsuspected
by
your
friends
here
and
that
man
the
very
man
on
the
face
of
the
whom
you
or
any
of
ought
to
have
given
our
countenance
the
very
man
in
whom
we
were
all
by
every
of
duty
gratitude
and
esteem
to
have
shunned
and
who
you
are
this
to
renounce
for
ever
how
you
ever
be
acquainted
colonel
charles
lennox
of
rose
hall
is
a
mystery
none
of
us
can
fathom
but
surely
the
person
was
that
it
about
has
much
to
answer
for
douglas
to
whom
i
it
proper
to
immediate
on
the
subject
pretends
to
been
well
informed
of
all
that
has
going
on
and
even
insists
that
acquaintance
the
lennox
family
place
through
lady
that
we
know
to
be
impossible
lady
is
the
last
person
in
the
who
would
have
you
or
any
creature
for
whom
she
had
the
regard
to
a
lennox
the
enemy
of
the
race
i
most
trust
she
is
spared
the
we
have
all
experienced
at
this
painful
her
principles
and
regard
for
us
i
tremble
to
think
might
be
the
consequences
and
dear
sir
sampson
in
his
delicate
state
how
he
ever
be
able
to
such
a
blow
and
a
blow
too
from
your
mary
you
who
he
always
a
father
to
a
time
i
am
sure
you
sat
upon
his
and
you
certainly
have
forgot
the
shetland
pony
he
presented
you
the
day
you
was
five
old
and
a
return
for
such
favours
but
i
fondly
trust
it
not
yet
too
late
you
have
to
give
up
this
unworthy
attachment
and
all
be
forgotten
and
and
we
will
all
receive
you
as
if
had
happened
oh
mary
i
must
for
the
last
repeat
how
have
you
deceived
us
i
am
your
distressed
aunt
joan
douglas
i
conclude
abruptly
in
to
leave
for
your
aunt
nicky
to
her
sentiments
also
on
this
afflicting
subject
nicky
appendix
was
as
follows
dear
mary
jacky
has
read
her
letter
to
us
it
is
most
excellent
we
are
all
much
affected
by
it
not
a
word
but
deserves
to
be
printed
i
can
add
nothing
you
see
if
you
marry
colonel
none
of
us
can
be
at
your
marriage
how
could
we
i
hope
you
will
think
twice
about
it
second
thoughts
are
best
what
done
can
not
be
undone
yours
mary
felt
somewhat
in
the
situation
of
the
sleeper
awakened
as
she
perused
these
mysterious
anathemas
and
rubbed
her
eyes
more
than
once
in
hopes
of
dispelling
the
mist
that
she
thought
must
needs
be
upon
them
but
in
vain
it
seemed
only
to
increase
with
every
effort
she
made
to
remove
it
not
a
single
ray
of
light
fell
on
the
palpable
obscure
of
miss
jacky
composition
that
could
enable
her
to
penetrate
the
dark
profound
that
encompassed
her
she
was
aware
indeed
that
when
her
aunt
meant
to
be
pathetic
or
energetic
she
always
had
recourse
to
the
longest
and
the
strongest
words
she
could
possibly
lay
her
hands
upon
and
mary
had
been
well
accustomed
to
hear
her
childish
faults
and
juvenile
indiscretions
denounced
in
the
most
awful
terms
as
crimes
of
the
deepest
dye
many
an
exordium
she
had
listened
to
on
the
tearing
of
her
frock
or
the
losing
of
her
glove
that
might
have
served
as
a
preface
to
the
newgate
calendar
colquhoun
on
the
police
or
any
other
register
of
crimes
still
she
had
always
been
able
to
detect
some
clue
to
her
own
misdeeds
but
here
even
conjecture
was
baffled
and
in
vain
she
sought
for
some
for
her
imagination
in
the
probable
misdemeanour
of
her
lover
but
even
allowing
all
possible
latitude
for
jacky
pen
she
was
forced
to
acknowledge
there
must
be
some
ground
for
her
aunt
to
build
upon
superficial
as
her
structures
generally
were
like
children
they
had
always
something
to
rest
upon
though
unlike
them
her
creations
were
invariably
upon
a
gigantic
scale
mary
had
often
reflected
with
surprise
that
although
lady
maclauglan
had
been
the
person
to
introduce
her
to
lennox
no
intercourse
had
taken
place
between
the
families
themselves
and
when
she
had
mentioned
them
to
each
other
lennox
had
only
sighed
and
lady
maclaughlan
had
humphed
she
despaired
of
arriving
at
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
from
her
aunts
grizzy
brain
was
a
mere
wisp
of
contradictions
and
mind
was
of
that
violent
hue
that
cast
its
own
shade
upon
every
object
that
came
in
contact
with
it
to
mention
the
matter
to
colonel
lennox
was
only
to
make
the
relations
ridiculous
and
in
short
although
it
was
a
formidable
step
the
result
of
her
deliberation
was
to
go
to
lady
maclaughlan
and
request
a
solution
of
her
aunt
dark
sayings
she
therefore
departed
for
milsom
street
and
upon
entering
the
found
grizzy
alone
and
evidently
in
even
more
than
usual
perturbation
oh
mary
cried
she
as
her
niece
entered
i
sure
i
thankful
you
come
i
was
just
wishing
for
you
you
ca
think
how
much
mischief
your
yesterday
visit
has
done
it
a
thousand
pities
i
declare
that
ever
you
said
a
word
about
your
marriage
to
sir
sampson
but
of
course
i
do
mean
to
blame
you
mary
you
know
you
help
it
so
do
vex
yourself
for
you
know
that
will
not
make
the
thing
any
better
now
only
if
sir
sampson
should
die
to
be
sure
i
must
always
think
it
was
that
that
killed
him
and
i
sure
it
at
will
soon
kill
me
a
friend
oh
mary
here
a
burst
of
grief
choked
poor
miss
grizzy
utterance
my
dear
aunt
said
mary
you
certainly
must
be
mistaken
sir
sampson
seems
to
retain
no
recollection
of
me
it
is
therefore
impossible
that
i
could
cause
him
any
pain
or
agitation
oh
certainly
said
grizzy
there
no
doubt
sir
sampson
has
quite
forgot
you
mary
and
no
your
being
so
long
away
but
i
daresay
he
come
to
know
you
yet
but
i
sure
i
hope
to
goodness
he
never
know
you
as
lennox
mary
that
would
break
his
heart
altogether
for
you
know
the
lennoxes
have
always
been
the
greatest
enemies
of
the
maclaughlans
and
of
course
sir
sampson
ca
bear
anybody
of
the
name
which
is
quite
natural
and
it
was
very
thoughtless
in
me
to
have
forgot
that
till
philistine
put
me
in
mind
of
it
and
poor
sir
sampson
has
had
a
very
bad
night
so
i
sure
i
hope
mary
never
think
any
more
about
colonel
lennox
and
take
my
word
for
it
you
get
plenty
of
husbands
yet
now
since
there
a
peace
there
will
be
plenty
of
fine
young
officers
coming
home
there
young
balquhadan
a
captain
i
know
in
some
regiment
and
dhalahulish
and
lochgrunason
and
but
miss
grizzy
ideas
here
shot
out
into
so
many
ramifications
upon
so
many
different
branches
of
the
county
tree
that
it
would
be
in
vain
for
any
but
a
true
celt
to
attempt
to
follow
her
mary
again
tried
to
lead
her
back
to
the
subject
of
the
lennoxes
in
hopes
of
being
able
to
extract
some
spark
of
knowledge
from
the
dark
chaos
of
her
brain
oh
i
sure
mary
if
you
want
to
hear
about
that
i
can
tell
you
plenty
about
the
lennoxes
or
at
any
rate
about
the
maclaughlans
which
is
the
same
thing
but
i
must
first
find
my
huswife
to
save
miss
grizzy
reminiscence
a
few
words
will
suffice
to
clear
up
the
mystery
a
family
feud
of
remote
origin
had
long
subsisted
between
the
families
of
lennox
and
maclaughlan
which
had
been
carefully
transmitted
from
father
to
son
till
the
hereditary
brand
had
been
deposited
in
the
breast
of
sir
sampson
by
the
death
of
many
intervening
heirs
general
lennox
then
a
youth
was
next
in
succession
to
the
maclaughlan
estate
but
the
power
of
alienating
it
was
vested
in
sir
sampson
as
the
last
remaining
heir
of
the
entail
by
the
mistaken
zeal
of
their
friends
both
were
at
an
early
period
placed
in
the
same
regiment
in
the
hope
that
constant
as
association
together
would
quickly
destroy
their
mutual
prejudices
and
produce
a
reconciliation
but
the
inequalities
were
too
great
ever
to
assimilate
sir
sampson
possessed
a
large
fortune
a
deformed
person
and
a
weak
vain
irritable
mind
general
then
ensign
lennox
had
no
other
patrimony
than
his
sword
a
handsome
person
high
spirit
and
dauntless
courage
with
these
tempers
it
may
easily
be
conceived
that
a
thousand
trifling
events
occurred
to
keep
alive
the
hereditary
animosity
sir
mind
expected
from
his
poor
kinsman
a
degree
of
deference
and
respect
which
the
other
so
far
from
rendering
rather
sought
opportunities
of
showing
his
contempt
for
and
of
thwarting
and
ridiculing
him
upon
every
occasion
till
sir
sampson
was
obliged
to
quit
the
regiment
from
that
time
it
was
understood
that
all
bearing
the
name
of
lennox
were
for
ever
excluded
from
the
succession
to
the
maclaughlan
estates
and
it
was
deemed
a
sort
of
petty
treason
even
to
name
the
name
of
a
lennox
in
presence
of
this
dignified
chieftain
many
years
had
worn
away
and
sir
sampson
had
passed
through
the
various
modifications
of
human
nature
from
the
mewling
infant
to
mere
oblivion
without
having
become
either
wiser
or
better
his
mind
remained
the
same
irascible
and
vindictive
to
the
last
lady
maclaughlan
had
too
much
sense
to
attempt
to
reason
or
argue
him
out
of
his
prejudices
but
she
contrived
to
prevent
him
from
ever
executing
a
new
entail
she
had
known
and
esteemed
both
general
and
lennox
before
her
marriage
with
sir
sampson
and
she
was
too
firm
and
decided
in
her
predilections
ever
to
abandon
them
and
while
she
had
the
credit
of
sharing
in
all
her
husband
animosity
she
was
silently
protecting
the
lawful
rights
of
those
who
had
long
ceased
to
consider
them
as
such
general
lennox
had
always
understood
that
he
and
his
family
were
under
sir
sampson
and
he
possessed
too
high
a
spirit
ever
to
express
a
regret
or
even
allude
to
the
circumstances
it
had
therefore
made
a
very
faint
impression
on
the
minds
of
any
of
his
family
and
in
the
long
lapse
of
years
had
been
almost
forgot
by
lennox
till
recalled
by
lady
maclaughlan
letter
but
she
had
been
silent
on
the
subject
to
mary
for
she
could
not
conceal
from
herself
that
her
husband
had
been
to
blame
that
the
heat
and
violence
of
his
temper
had
often
led
him
to
provoke
and
exasperate
where
mildness
and
forbearance
would
have
soothed
and
conciliated
without
detracting
from
his
dignity
but
her
gentle
heart
shrank
from
the
task
of
unnecessarily
disclosing
the
faults
of
the
man
she
had
loved
and
then
she
heard
mary
talk
with
rapture
of
the
wild
beauties
of
lochmarlie
she
had
only
sighed
to
think
that
the
pride
and
prejudice
of
others
had
alienated
the
inheritance
of
her
son
but
all
this
mary
was
still
in
ignorance
of
for
miss
grizzy
had
gone
completely
astray
in
the
attempt
to
trace
the
rise
and
progress
of
the
lennox
and
maclaughlan
feud
happily
lady
maclauglan
entrance
extricated
her
from
her
labyrinth
as
it
as
the
signal
for
her
to
repair
to
sir
sampson
mary
in
some
little
confusion
was
beginning
to
express
to
her
ladyship
regret
at
hearing
that
sir
sampson
had
been
so
unwell
when
she
was
stopped
my
dear
child
do
learn
to
tell
lies
you
do
care
two
pence
for
sir
sampson
i
know
all
you
are
going
to
be
married
to
charles
lennox
i
glad
of
it
i
wished
you
to
marry
him
whether
you
thank
me
for
that
twenty
years
hence
ca
tell
you
ca
tell
he
tell
god
knows
humph
your
aunts
will
tell
you
he
is
beelzebub
because
his
father
said
he
could
make
a
sir
sampson
out
of
a
mouldy
lemon
perhaps
he
could
i
do
know
but
your
aunts
are
fools
you
know
what
fools
are
and
so
do
i
there
are
plenty
of
fools
in
the
world
but
if
they
had
not
been
sent
for
some
wise
purpose
they
would
have
been
here
and
since
they
are
here
they
have
as
good
a
right
to
have
in
the
world
as
the
wisest
sir
sampson
hated
general
lennox
because
he
laughed
at
him
and
if
sir
sampson
had
lived
a
hundred
years
ago
his
hatred
might
have
been
a
fine
thing
to
talk
about
now
it
is
the
same
passion
that
makes
heroes
of
your
de
montforts
and
your
manuels
and
your
corsairs
and
all
the
rest
of
them
but
they
wore
cloaks
and
daggers
and
these
are
the
supporters
of
hatred
everybody
laughs
at
the
hatred
of
a
little
old
man
in
a
cocked
hat
you
may
laugh
too
so
now
god
bless
you
continue
as
you
are
and
marry
the
man
you
like
though
the
world
should
set
its
teeth
against
you
is
not
every
woman
can
be
trusted
to
do
that
farewell
and
with
a
cordial
salute
they
parted
mary
was
too
well
accustomed
to
lady
maclaughlan
style
not
to
comprehend
that
her
marriage
with
colonel
lennox
was
an
event
she
had
long
wished
for
and
now
most
warmly
sanctioned
and
she
hastened
home
to
convey
the
glad
tidings
in
a
letter
to
her
aunts
though
doubtful
if
the
truth
itself
would
be
able
to
pierce
its
way
through
their
prejudices
another
stroke
of
palsy
soon
rendered
sir
sampson
unconscious
even
to
the
charms
of
grizzy
conversation
and
as
she
was
no
longer
of
use
to
him
and
was
evidently
at
a
loss
how
to
employ
herself
mary
proposed
that
she
should
accompany
her
back
to
lochmarlie
to
which
she
yielded
a
joyful
assent
once
convinced
of
lady
maclaughlan
approbation
of
her
niece
marriage
she
could
think
and
talk
of
nothing
else
some
wise
individuals
have
thought
that
most
people
act
from
the
inspiration
of
either
a
good
or
an
evil
power
to
which
class
miss
grizzy
belonged
would
have
puzzled
the
most
profound
metaphysician
to
determine
she
was
in
fact
a
maclaughlanite
but
to
find
the
of
maclaughlan
is
another
difficulty
thought
is
lost
colonel
lennox
although
a
little
startled
at
his
first
introduction
to
his
future
aunt
soon
came
to
understand
the
of
her
character
and
his
enlarged
mind
and
good
temper
made
such
ample
allowance
for
her
weaknesses
that
she
protested
with
tears
in
her
eyes
she
never
knew
the
like
of
him
she
never
could
think
enough
of
him
she
wished
to
goodness
sir
sampson
was
himself
again
and
could
only
see
him
she
was
sure
he
would
think
just
as
she
did
etc
etc
etc
the
day
of
lady
emily
marriage
arrived
and
found
her
in
a
more
serious
mood
than
she
had
hitherto
appeared
in
though
it
seemed
doubtful
whether
it
was
most
occasioned
by
her
own
prospects
or
the
thoughts
of
parting
with
mary
who
with
aunt
grizzy
was
to
set
off
for
lochmarlie
immediately
after
witnessing
the
ceremony
edward
and
his
bride
would
fain
have
accompanied
her
but
lord
courtland
was
too
much
accustomed
to
his
daughter
and
amused
by
his
nephew
to
bear
their
absence
and
they
therefore
yielded
the
point
though
with
reluctance
this
is
all
for
want
of
a
little
opposition
to
have
braced
my
nerves
said
lady
emily
as
she
dropped
a
few
tears
i
verily
believe
i
should
have
wept
outright
had
i
not
happily
descried
redgill
shrugging
his
shoulders
at
me
that
has
given
a
filip
to
my
spirits
after
all
is
perhaps
a
foolish
action
i
committed
the
icy
bonds
of
matrimony
are
upon
me
already
i
feel
myself
turning
into
a
fond
faithful
rational
humble
wife
alas
i
must
now
turn
my
head
into
a
museum
and
hang
up
all
my
smart
sayings
inside
my
brain
there
to
petrify
as
warnings
to
all
pert
misses
dear
mary
if
ever
i
am
good
for
anything
it
will
be
to
you
i
owe
it
mary
could
only
embrace
her
cousin
in
silence
as
she
parted
from
her
brother
and
her
with
the
deepest
emotion
and
assisted
by
colonel
lennox
who
was
to
follow
took
her
station
by
the
side
of
her
aunt
i
wish
you
a
pleasant
journey
miss
mary
cried
redgill
the
game
season
is
coming
on
and
but
the
carriage
drove
off
and
the
rest
of
the
sentence
was
dispersed
by
the
wind
and
all
that
could
be
collected
was
grouse
always
acceptable
friends
at
a
distance
roebuck
stuffed
with
heather
carries
well
at
all
times
etc
etc
to
one
less
practised
in
her
ways
and
less
gifted
with
patience
the
eternal
babbling
of
aunt
grizzy
as
a
travelling
companion
would
have
occasioned
considerable
ennui
if
not
spleen
there
are
perhaps
few
greater
trials
of
temper
than
that
of
travelling
with
a
person
who
thinks
it
necessary
to
be
actively
pleasant
without
a
intermission
from
the
rising
till
the
setting
sun
grizzy
was
upon
this
fatal
plan
the
rock
of
thousands
silence
she
thought
synonymous
with
low
spirits
and
she
talked
and
wondered
and
exclaimed
incessantly
and
assured
mary
she
need
not
be
uneasy
she
was
certain
colonel
lennox
would
follow
very
soon
she
had
not
the
least
doubt
of
that
she
would
not
be
surprised
if
he
was
to
be
at
lochmarlie
almost
as
soon
as
themselves
at
any
rate
very
soon
after
them
but
even
these
little
torments
were
forgot
by
mary
when
she
found
herself
again
in
her
native
land
the
hills
the
air
the
waters
the
people
even
the
had
a
charm
that
touched
her
heart
and
brought
tears
into
her
eyes
as
they
pictured
home
but
her
feelings
arose
to
rapture
when
lochmarlie
burst
upon
her
view
in
all
the
grandeur
beauty
and
repose
of
a
setting
sun
shedding
its
farewell
rays
of
gold
and
purple
and
tints
of
such
matchless
hue
as
no
pencil
ere
can
imitate
no
poet
pen
describe
rocks
woods
hills
and
waters
all
shone
with
a
radiance
that
seemed
of
more
than
earthly
beauty
oh
there
are
moments
in
life
keen
blissful
never
to
be
forgotten
and
such
was
the
moment
to
mary
when
the
carriage
stopped
and
she
again
heard
the
melody
of
that
voice
familiar
from
infancy
and
looked
on
the
face
known
with
her
being
and
was
pressed
to
that
heart
where
glowed
a
parent
love
when
mary
recovered
from
the
first
almost
transports
of
joy
she
marked
with
delight
the
increased
animation
and
cheerfulness
visible
in
douglas
all
the
livelier
feelings
of
her
warm
heart
had
indeed
been
excited
and
brought
into
action
by
the
spirit
and
playfulness
of
her
little
boy
and
the
increased
happiness
of
her
husband
while
all
her
uneasiness
respecting
her
former
lover
was
now
at
an
end
she
had
heard
from
himself
that
he
had
married
and
was
happy
without
being
guilty
of
inconstancy
such
are
the
effects
of
time
upon
mutable
human
nature
colonel
lennox
lost
no
time
in
arriving
to
claim
his
promised
bride
and
mary
happiness
was
complete
when
she
found
her
own
choice
so
warmly
approved
of
by
the
friends
she
loved
the
three
aunts
and
their
unmarried
nieces
now
the
sole
inhabitants
of
glenfern
castle
were
not
quite
decided
in
their
opinions
at
first
miss
jacky
looked
with
a
suspicious
eye
upon
the
enemy
of
the
maclaughlan
race
but
upon
better
acquaintance
his
gaiety
and
contrived
to
charm
asleep
even
her
good
sense
and
prejudices
and
she
pronounced
him
to
be
a
pleasant
young
man
who
gave
himself
no
airs
although
he
certainly
had
rather
a
high
look
nicky
doubted
from
his
appearance
that
he
would
be
nice
and
she
had
no
patience
with
nice
men
but
nicky
fears
vanished
when
she
saw
as
she
expressed
it
how
pleasantly
he
ate
the
sheep
head
although
he
had
never
seen
one
in
his
life
before
the
younger
ladies
thought
captain
had
a
finer
complexion
and
wondered
whether
colonel
lennox
like
him
would
be
dressed
in
full
regimentals
at
his
marriage
but
alas
all
earthly
good
still
blends
itself
with
harm
for
on
the
day
of
mary
marriage
a
day
consecrated
to
mirth
and
and
wedding
favors
and
marriage
presents
and
good
cheer
and
reels
and
revelry
and
bagpipes
on
that
very
day
when
the
marriage
ceremony
was
scarcely
over
arrived
the
accounts
of
the
death
of
sir
sampson
maclaughlan
but
on
this
joyous
day
even
grizzy
tears
did
not
flow
so
freely
as
they
would
have
done
at
another
time
and
she
declared
that
although
it
was
impossible
anybody
could
feel
more
than
she
did
yet
certainly
it
would
not
be
using
colonel
and
lennox
well
to
be
very
distressed
upon
such
an
occasion
and
there
was
no
doubt
but
she
would
have
plenty
of
time
to
be
sorry
about
it
yet
when
they
were
all
sitting
quietly
by
themselves
with
nothing
else
in
their
heads
though
to
be
sure
they
must
always
think
what
a
blessing
it
was
that
colonel
lennox
was
to
succeed
i
wish
he
may
ever
fill
sir
sampson
shoes
said
miss
nicky
with
a
sigh
colonel
lennox
can
not
propose
a
better
model
to
himself
than
sir
sampson
maclaughlan
said
miss
jacky
he
has
left
him
a
noble
example
of
propriety
frugality
hospitality
and
respectability
and
above
all
of
forgiveness
of
his
mortal
enemies
oh
mary
exclaimed
miss
grizzy
as
they
were
about
to
part
with
their
niece
what
a
lucky
creature
you
are
never
i
am
sure
did
any
young
person
set
out
in
life
with
such
advantages
to
think
of
your
succeeding
to
lady
maclaughlan
laboratory
all
so
nicely
fitted
up
with
every
kind
of
thing
and
especially
plenty
of
the
most
charming
bark
which
i
sure
will
do
colonel
lennox
the
greatest
good
as
you
know
all
officers
are
much
the
better
of
bark
i
know
it
was
the
saving
of
young
ballingall
life
when
he
came
home
in
an
ague
from
some
place
and
certain
lady
maclaughlan
will
leave
you
everything
that
is
there
you
was
always
such
a
favourite
not
but
what
i
must
always
think
that
you
had
a
hand
in
dear
sir
sampson
death
indeed
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
yet
at
the
same
time
i
do
mean
to
blame
you
in
the
least
for
certain
if
sir
sampson
had
been
spared
he
would
have
been
delighted
as
we
all
are
at
your
marriage
colonel
and
lennox
agreed
in
making
choice
of
lochmarlie
for
their
future
residence
and
in
a
virtuous
attachment
they
found
as
much
happiness
as
earth
pilgrims
ever
possess
whose
greatest
felicity
must
spring
from
a
higher
source
the
extensive
influence
which
generally
attends
upon
virtue
joined
to
prosperity
was
used
by
them
for
its
best
purposes
it
was
not
confined
either
to
rich
or
poor
to
caste
or
sect
but
all
shared
in
their
benevolence
whom
that
benevolence
could
benefit
and
the
poor
he
sick
and
the
desolate
united
in
blessing
what
heaven
had
already
blessed
this
happy
marriage
the
end
