the

of
unused
air
elusive
ironically
fragrant
as
a
dead
queen
kerchief

me
blow
the

from
off

resurrect
your
breath

to
larkin
wind
rising
in
the
alleys
shadows
over
a
cradle
craning
a
hand
throws
something
in
the
fire
and
a
smaller
hand
runs
into
the
flame
and
out
again
singed
and
empty
shadows
settling
over
a
cradle
two
hands
and
a
fire
i
celia
cherry
cherry
glowing
on
the
hearth
bright
red
cherry
when
you
try
to
pick
up
cherry
celia
shriek
sticks
in
you
like
a
pin
when
god
throws
hailstones
you
cuddle
in
celia
shawl
and
press
your
feet
on
her
belly
high
up
like
a
stool
when
celia
makes
umbrella
of
her
hand
rain
falls
through
big
pink
spokes
of
her
fingers
when
wind
blows
celia
gown
up
off
her
legs
she
runs
under
pillars
of
the
bank
great
round
pillars
of
the
bank
have
on
white
stockings
too
celia
says
my
father
will
bring
me
a
golden
bowl
when
i
think
of
my
father
i
can
not
see
him
for
the
big
yellow
bowl
like
the
moon
with
two
handles
he
carries
in
front
of
him
grandpa
grandpa
light
all
about
you
ginger
pouring
out
of
green
jars
you
do
believe
he
has
gone
away
and
left
his
great
coat
so
you
pretend
you
see
his
face
up
in
the
ceiling
when
you
clap
your
hands
and
cry
grandpa
grandpa
grandpa
celia
crosses
herself
it
is
a
dream
it
comes
again
and
again
you
hear
ivy
crying
on
steeples
the
flames
have
caught
yet
and
images
screaming
when
they
see
red
light
on
the
lilies
on
the
stained
glass
window
of
joseph
the
girl
with
the
black
eyes
holds
you
tight
and
you
run
and
run
past
the
wild
wild
towers
and
trees
in
the
gardens
tugging
at
their
feet
and
little
frightened
dolls
shut
up
in
the
shops
crying
and
crying
because
no
one
stops
you
spin
like
a
penny
thrown
out
in
the
street
then
the
man
clutches
her
by
the
hair
he
always
clutches
her
by
the
hair
his
eyes
stick
out
like
spears
you
see
her
face
and
her
black
black
eyes
lit
up
by
the
glare
then
everything
goes
out
please
god
do
let
me
dream
any
more
of
the
girl
with
the
black
black
eyes
celia
shadow
rocks
and
rocks
and
mama
eyes
stare
out
of
the
pillow
as
though
she
had
gone
away
and
the
night
had
come
in
her
place
as
it
comes
in
empty
rooms
you
ca
bear
it
the
night
threshing
about
and
lashing
its
tail
on
its
sides
as
bold
as
a
wolf
that
is
afraid
and
you
scream
at
her
face
that
is
white
as
a
stone
on
a
grave
and
pull
it
around
to
the
light
till
the
night
draws
backward
the
night
that
walks
alone
and
goes
away
without
end
mama
says
i
am
cold
betty
and
shivers
celia
tucks
the
quilt
about
her
feet
but
i
run
for
my
little
red
cloak
because
red
is
hot
like
fire
i
wish
celia
could
see
the
sea
climb
up
on
the
sky
and
slide
off
again
celia
saying
i
beg
the
world
with
you
celia
holding
on
to
the
cab
hands
wrenched
away
wind
in
the
masts
like
celia
crying
celia
never
minded
if
you
slapped
her
when
the
comb
made
your
hairs
ache
but
though
you
rub
your
cheek
against
mama
hand
she
has
not
said
darling
since
now
i
will
slap
her
again
i
will
bite
her
hand
till
it
bleeds
it
is
cool
by
the
port
hole
the
wet
rags
of
the
wind
flap
in
your
face
ii
the
alley
because
you
are
four
years
old
the
candle
is
all
dressed
up
in
a
new
frill
and
stars
nod
to
you
through
the
hole
in
the
curtain
except
the
big
stiff
planets
too
fat
to
move
about
much
and
you
curtsey
back
to
the
stars
when
no
one
is
looking
you
feel
sorry
for
the
poor
wooden
chair
that
knows
it
is
nice
to
sit
on
and
no
one
is
sad
but
mama
you
do
like
mama
to
be
sad
when
you
are
four
years
old
so
you
pretend
you
like
the
bitter
tea
you
pretend
if
you
do
drink
it
up
pretty
quick
a
little
will
think
it
is
a
pond
and
come
and
get
born
in
it
it
hot
in
our
street
and
the
breeze
is
a
dirty
little
broom
that
sweeps
dust
into
our
room
and
bits
of
paper
out
of
the
alley
you
are
not
let
to
play
with
the
children
in
the
alley
but
you
must
be
very
polite
so
you
pass
them
and
say
good
day
and
when
they
fling
banana
skins
you
fling
them
back
again
there
is
no
one
to
play
with
and
the
flies
on
the
window
buzz
and
buzz
you
can
pull
out
their
legs
and
stick
pins
in
their
bodies
but
still
they
buzz
and
mama
says
when
nero
was
a
little
boy
he
caught
flies
on
his
mama
window
and
pulled
out
their
legs
and
stuck
pins
in
their
bodies
and
nobody
loved
him
buzz
flies
buzz
nasty
black
wheel
of
mama
machine
you
are
the
biggest
fly
of
all
you
have
the
loudest
buzz
i
hear
you
at
dawn
before
the
locusts
but
i
like
the
picture
of
the
flood
and
the
little
babies
getting
drowned
if
i
were
there
i
would
save
them
but
as
i
ca
save
them
i
like
to
watch
them
getting
drowned
when
mama
buys
of
ling
ho
he
smiles
very
wide
and
picks
her
the
largest
loquots
the
gave
her
a
cabbage
and
she
held
it
against
her
black
bodice
and
said
what
a
beautiful
green
it
was
and
put
it
on
the
table
as
though
it
had
been
a
flower
but
next
day
we
boiled
and
ate
it
with
salt
it
was
our
dinner
christmas
day
i
found
janie
on
my
pillow
janie
is
made
of
rubber
her
red
and
blue
jacket
wo
come
off
christmas
dinner
was
green
and
white
chicken
and
lettuce
and
peas
and
drops
of
oil
on
the
salad
smiley
and
full
of
light
like
the
gold
on
the
lady
teeth
but
mama
said
politely
thank
you
we
are
dining
out
she
would
let
you
take
one
pea
to
put
in
the
hole
where
the
whistle
was
at
the
back
of
janie
head
so
janie
should
have
some
dinner
so
you
went
to
the
park
with
biscuits
and
black
tea
in
a
bottle
you
feel
very
sad
when
you
climb
on
the
fence
to
watch
mama
out
of
sight
the
women
in
the
alley
poke
their
heads
out
of
doorways
and
watch
her
too
you
know
her
by
the
way
she
holds
her
shoulders
till
she
is
only
a
speck
in
a
chain
of
specks
till
she
is
swallowed
up
but
suppose
that
day
after
day
you
were
to
watch
for
her
face
and
it
did
come
back
suppose
it
were
to
drop
out
of
the
string
of
white
faces
like
the
pearl
out
of
my
chain
i
never
found
again
mabel
minds
you
while
mama
is
out
she
washes
while
she
sings
three
blind
mice
they
all
run
away
from
the
farmer
wife
who
cut
off
their
tails
with
a
carving
knife
wind
blows
out
mabel
sheets
way
you
blow
in
a
bag
before
you
burst
it
wind
has
a
soapy
smell
it
sun
that
lies
all
over
you
without
any
weight
and
makes
you
feel
happy
and
crinkly
like
bubbling
water
there
no
sun
on
the
empty
house
house
you
ca
see
in
its
windows
that
watch
you
out
of
their
corners
perhaps
there
a
big
spider
there
spinning
gray
threads
over
the
windows
till
they
look
like
dead
people
faces
jimmie
says
jimmie
hair
is
white
as
a
white
mouse
his
lashes
are
gold
as
mama
wedding
ring
and
his
mouth
feels
cool
and
smooth
like
a
flower
wet
with
rain
you
would
believe
jimmie
was
different
till
he
showed
you
blind
wet
sheets
flapping
on
the
lines
sun
in
your
eyes
dark
gold
sun
full
of
little
black
spots
you
have
to
blink
and
blink
round
eyes
of
jimmie
jimmie
blue
jumper
blue
shadow
of
wall
all
the
world
holding
still
as
when
a
clock
stops
streets
still
people
still
no
streets
no
people
only
sky
and
wall
sun
glaring
bright
as
god
down
at
you
and
jimmie
shadow
like
a
purple
cloth
trailing
off
the
wall
wild
wet
sheets
flapping
in
the
wind
big
slippered
feet
flapping
too
rushing
up
the
alley
houses
closing
up
again
windows
looking
round
mabel
pulls
you
in
the
gate
and
shakes
you
and
tells
you
not
to
tell
your
mama
and
you
wonder
if
god
has
spoiled
jimmie
iii
mama
mama
face
is
smooth
and
pale
as
leaves
that
ivory
oval
of
aunt
gem
you
sucked
the
miniature
off
had
black
black
hair
like
mama
mama
walks
so
fast
street
lamps
jig
without
bending
a
leg
lights
in
the
windows
play
twinkling
tunes
on
crimson
and
blue
bottles
like
bubbles
big
as
balloons
faster
and
faster
and
pink
light
spurts
over
cakes
doing
polkas
in
little
white
shirts
with
in
flounced
white
skirts
mama
walks
slower
slower
and
slower
eyes
lamps
stars
acres
and
acres
of
stars
bells
and
sleepily
flapping
feet
you
glad
mama
walks
slow
it
nice
to
be
carried
along
up
high
near
the
stars
that
look
at
you
with
a
grave
great
look
every
night
mama
sings
you
to
sleep
when
she
sings
o
for
the
light
of
thine
eyes
dolores
there
a
castle
on
a
cliff
and
the
sea
roars
like
lions
it
leaps
at
the
castle
and
the
cliff
knocks
it
down
but
always
the
sea
shakes
its
flattened
head
and
gets
up
again
the
castle
has
no
roof
so
the
rain
spins
silvery
webs
in
it
and
dolores
face
floats
dim
and
beautiful
the
way
flowers
do
when
they
are
drowned
step
by
white
step
she
goes
up
the
castle
stairs
but
the
stair
goes
up
into
the
sky
and
the
sky
keeps
going
up
too
and
none
of
them
ever
get
there
when
mama
sings
ba
ba
black
sheep
the
stars
seem
to
shine
through
her
voice
so
everything
has
to
be
still
and
when
she
has
finished
singing
her
song
goes
up
off
the
earth
higher
and
higher
till
it
is
only
as
big
as
a
tiny
silver
bird
with
nothing
but
moonlight
around
it
iv
betty
you
can
see
the
sandhills
from
our
new
room
butterflies
live
in
the
sandhills
and
lizards
and
centipedes
if
you
keep
very
still
lizards
will
think
you
a
stone
and
run
over
your
lap
butterflies
liveries
are
scarlet
and
black
they
drive
chariots
in
air
people
in
the
chariots
are
pale
as
dew
you
can
see
right
through
them
but
the
chariots
are
made
of
gold
of
the
sun
they
go
up
to
heaven
and
never
catch
fire
there
are
green
centipedes
and
brown
centipedes
and
black
centipedes
because
green
and
brown
and
black
are
the
colors
in
hell
flag
centipedes
have
hundreds
of
feet
because
it
is
so
far
from
hell
to
come
up
for
air
centipedes
do
not
hurry
they
are
waiting
for
the
last
day
when
they
will
creep
over
the
false
prophets
who
will
have
their
hands
tied
night
calls
to
the
sandhills
and
gathers
them
under
her
she
pushes
away
cities
because
their
sharp
lights
hurt
her
soft
breast
even
candles
make
a
sore
place
when
they
stick
in
the
night
there
are
things
in
the
sandhills
that
no
one
knows
about
they
come
out
at
dark
when
the
young
snakes
play
and
tell
each
other
secrets
in
the
deaf
logs
sometimes
before
rain
when
the
stars
have
gone
inside
the
night
comes
close
to
your
window
and
sniffs
at
the
light
but
you
must
not
run
away
you
must
keep
your
face
to
the
night
and
walk
backward
when
it
rains
and
you
are
pulling
off
flies
legs
mama
lets
you
play
houses
with
lizzie
and
clara
because
you
are
the
only
one
and
because
only
ones
have
to
live
alone
while
sisters
stay
together
lizzie
and
clara
give
you
the
dry
house
and
take
the
one
with
the
leaking
roof
rain
like
curly
hairpins
blows
on
lizzie
and
clara
two
heads
turned
like
one
head
two
mouths
spread
into
one
laugh
lizzie
is
saying
why
do
you
want
to
play
when
you
feel
you
like
to
braid
the
rain
into
a
shining
rope
to
climb
up
and
up
and
up
into
the
wet
sky
and
never
see
any
one
again
our
gate
does
hang
right
it
must
have
pawed
at
the
wind
and
gotten
a
kick
as
the
wind
passed
over
the
sitting
sky
puffs
out
a
gray
smoke
and
the
wind
makes
a
sound
blowing
out
straight
but
our
gate
drags
its
foot
and
whines
to
itself
on
one
hinge
what
do
you
think
i
found
two
wee
knickers
of
fairy
brass
or
two
gold
sovereigns
folded
up
in
a
bit
of
green
silk
or
two
gold
bugs
in
little
green
shirts
if
you
want
to
know
you
must
walk
so
your
feet
just
whisper
in
the
grass
you
must
carry
them
careful
and
very
proud
for
their
stems
bleed
drops
of
milk
but
lizzie
and
clara
shout
in
glee
dandelions
you
look
in
the
eyes
of
people
to
see
if
they
feel
the
way
you
feel
but
they
hide
inside
of
themselves
and
so
you
do
not
find
out
people
say
the
stars
are
bright
but
they
do
not
say
what
you
are
thinking
about
stars
not
even
mama
says
what
you
are
thinking
about
stars
this
makes
you
feel
very
lonely
it
strange
about
stars
you
have
to
be
still
when
they
look
at
you
they
push
your
song
inside
of
you
with
their
song
their
long
silvery
rays
sink
into
you
and
do
not
hurt
it
is
good
to
feel
them
resting
on
you
like
great
white
birds
and
their
shining
whiteness
does
burn
like
the
sun
it
washes
all
over
you
and
makes
you
feel
water
my
doll
janie
has
no
waist
and
her
body
is
like
a
tub
with
feet
on
it
sometimes
i
beat
her
but
i
always
kiss
her
afterwards
when
i
have
kissed
all
the
paint
off
her
body
i
shall
tie
a
ribbon
about
it
so
she
sha
look
shabby
but
it
must
be
blue
it
must
be
pink
pink
shows
the
dirt
on
her
face
that
wo
wash
off
i
beat
janie
and
beat
her
but
still
she
smiled
so
i
scratched
her
between
the
eyes
with
a
pin
now
she
does
love
me
anymore
she
scowls
and
scowls
though
i
begged
her
to
forgive
me
and
poured
sugar
in
the
hole
at
the
back
of
her
head
mama
says
janie
is
a
fairy
doll
and
she
has
forgiven
me
that
she
gone
to
the
market
to
buy
me
some
sweets
now
she
at
the
door
and
a
little
bag
tied
to
her
neck
i
run
to
janie
and
kiss
her
all
over
ah
she
is
still
frowning
i
let
the
sweets
drop
on
the
floor
mama
has
told
you
a
lie
chinaman
singing
in
street
gleen
gleen
hot
sun
shining
on
your
face
it
must
be
a
new
day
but
why
are
you
happy
if
it
a
new
day
because
something
has
happened
something
sad
and
terrible
now
i
remember
it
janie
yesterday
i
took
janie
out
and
tied
my
handkerchief
over
her
face
and
put
sand
in
it
and
threw
her
into
the
ditch
down
in
the
black
water
under
the
dock
leaves
and
when
mama
asked
me
where
janie
was
i
said
i
had
lost
her
i
glad
it
is
so
i
be
able
to
go
to
sleep
and
forget
all
about
it
but
mama
looks
at
my
tongue
and
says
she
will
give
me
senna
tea
when
you
smell
the
tea
you
shut
your
eyes
tight
and
pretend
not
to
hear
the
soft
cool
voice
of
mama
that
goes
over
your
forehead
like
a
little
wind
and
then
you
lie
in
the
dark
and
stare
and
stare
till
the
faces
come
yellow
faces
with
leering
eyes
drifting
in
a
greeny
mist
i
wonder
if
janie
sees
faces
out
there
alone
in
the
dark
i
wonder
if
she
has
got
the
handkerchief
off
or
if
the
water
has
gone
in
the
hole
where
the
whistle
was
at
the
back
of
her
head
and
drowned
her
or
if
the
stars
can
see
her
under
the
dock
leaves
it
and
still
over
the
red
road
wind
must
be
lying
down
with
its
tail
under
it
does
even
flick
off
the
flies
and
you
can
hear
the
silence
buzzing
in
the
gum
trees
the
way
the
angels
buzzed
when
they
flew
through
the
cedars
of
lebanon
with
thin
gauze
wings
you
could
see
through
nice
to
hear
the
silence
buzzing
till
it
comes
too
close
and
booms
in
your
ears
and
presses
all
over
you
till
you
scream
when
you
scream
at
the
silence
it
goes
to
jingling
pieces
like
a
silver
mirror
broken
into
tiny
bits
perhaps
its
wings
are
made
of
glass
perhaps
it
lives
down
in
a
dark
dark
cave
and
only
comes
up
to
warm
its
wings
in
the
sun
it
cold
in
the
cave
no
matter
how
you
cover
yourself
up
little
girls
sit
there
dressed
in
white
and
the
dolls
in
their
arms
all
have
white
handkerchiefs
over
their
faces
their
shadows
can
not
play
with
them
their
shadows
lie
down
at
their
feet
for
the
little
girls
sit
stiff
as
stones
with
their
backs
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
where
a
little
light
falls
off
the
wings
of
the
silence
when
it
comes
down
out
of
the
sun
moon
catches
the
flying
fish
as
they
dive
in
the
bay
flying
fish
spin
over
and
over
into
the
water
mom
bends
over
jungles
and
touches
the
foreheads
of
tigers
as
they
pass
under
openings
made
by
dropped
leaves
tigers
stop
on
the
trail
of
the
deer
while
the
moon
is
on
their
foreheads
they
let
the
stags
go
by
moon
is
shining
strangely
on
the
white
palings
of
the
fence
fence
keeps
very
still
most
times
it
moves
a
little
everything
moves
a
little
though
you
may
know
it
but
now
the
little
fence
would
change
places
with
the
great
cross
that
stands
so
stiff
and
high
with
its
back
to
the
moon
moon
shining
strangely
on
the
white
palings
of
the
fence
i
am
shining
too
but
my
light
is
shut
inside
of
me
and
ca
get
out
old
house
with
black
windows
blind
house
begging
moonlight
to
put
out
the
shadows
why
do
you
want
so
much
light
you
creak
when
the
wind
steps
on
you
you
cough
up
dust
and
your
beams
ache
you
know
you
will
soon
fall
the
moon
just
pities
you
do
waste
yourself
moon
come
on
my
bed
and
play
with
me
wrap
me
up
in
blue
light
you
who
are
cool
i
am
too
hot
i
am
all
alive
and
the
shadows
are
outside
of
me
there
are
different
kinds
of
shadows
the
blind
ones
are
the
shadows
of
things
these
are
the
tame
shadows
they
love
to
play
on
the
wall
with
you
and
follow
you
about
like
cats
and
dogs
sometimes
they
hiss
at
you
softly
like
snakes
that
do
not
bite
or
swish
like
women
dresses
but
if
you
poke
a
candle
at
them
they
pull
in
their
heads
and
disappear
but
there
is
a
shadow
that
is
not
the
shadow
of
a
thing
it
is
a
thing
itself
when
you
meet
this
shadow
you
must
not
look
at
it
too
long
it
grows
with
your
looking
at
it
till
you
are
all
alone
with
nothing
around
you
nothing
nothing
nothing
but
a
shadow
with
its
eyes
full
of
black
light
there
a
shadow
in
the
corner
of
the
shed
crouching
lying
in
wait
a
black
coiled
shadow
watching
ready
to
strike
but
i
must
be
afraid
of
it
i
must
be
afraid
of
anything
poor
evil
shadow
the
candle
would
chase
it
away
only
she
ca
get
at
it
do
you
think
that
every
one
hates
you
shadow
with
your
back
to
the
wall
afraid
to
lie
down
and
sleep
but
i
do
hate
you
even
the
moon
means
to
be
kind
she
just
treads
on
you
as
i
tread
on
a
worm
that
i
did
see
do
be
afraid
of
me
shadow
see
i
no
light
in
my
hand
nothing
to
save
myself
with
yet
i
walk
right
up
to
you
if
you
let
me
i
put
my
arms
around
you
and
stroke
you
softly
are
you
surprised
i
put
my
arms
around
you
is
it
your
black
black
sorrow
that
nobody
loves
you
v
jude
when
you
tell
mama
you
are
going
to
do
something
great
she
looks
at
you
as
though
you
were
a
window
she
were
trying
to
see
through
and
says
she
hopes
you
will
be
good
instead
of
great
when
you
are
five
years
old
you
spend
the
day
in
the
gardens
the
grass
is
greener
than
cabbages
and
orange
lilies
stand
up
very
straight
and
will
not
curtsey
to
the
sun
when
the
wind
tells
them
only
pansies
bow
down
very
low
pansies
make
little
purple
cushions
for
queen
bees
to
stand
on
bees
have
brown
silk
hair
on
their
bodies
if
you
are
careful
they
will
let
you
stroke
them
the
trees
over
the
marble
man
catch
up
all
the
sunbeams
so
the
shadows
have
it
their
way
the
shadows
swallow
him
up
like
a
blue
shark
when
you
scoop
a
sunbeam
up
on
your
palm
and
offer
it
to
the
marble
man
he
does
not
notice
he
looks
into
his
stone
beard
when
you
do
something
great
people
give
you
a
stone
face
so
you
do
not
care
any
more
when
the
sun
throws
gold
on
you
through
the
wind
makes
in
green
bushes
this
thought
makes
me
very
sad
jude
has
eyes
like
tobacco
with
yellow
specks
on
it
and
his
hair
is
red
as
a
red
orange
jude
and
i
have
made
a
garden
in
the
field
that
no
one
knows
about
we
creep
in
and
out
through
a
little
place
where
the
barbed
wire
is
down
we
lie
in
the
long
grass
and
crush
dandelions
between
our
two
cheeks
till
the
milk
comes
out
on
our
faces
we
hold
each
other
tight
and
the
wind
all
over
us
and
pelts
us
with
jude
is
afraid
of
shadows
not
even
of
the
ones
that
have
eyes
in
them
and
he
can
look
in
the
face
of
the
sun
without
blinking
at
all
hush
do
say
sun
so
loud
the
sun
gets
angry
when
you
stare
at
him
if
you
peek
in
his
he
spreads
into
a
great
white
flame
like
god
out
of
his
burning
bush
till
you
put
your
hands
up
on
your
face
and
tremble
like
a
drop
of
rain
upon
a
flower
that
some
one
throws
into
the
fire
and
then
the
sun
makes
himself
small
the
sun
swings
down
out
of
the
sky
a
star
little
as
a
spark
little
as
a
fierce
red
spider
on
a
burning
thread
and
then
the
light
goes
out
shivers
into
blackened
bits
you
hold
on
to
a
wall
that
whirls
around
and
the
gate
is
a
black
hole
you
grope
your
way
in
like
a
toad
that
blinded
by
a
stone
and
mama
puts
on
cold
wet
rags
that
get
hot
soon
hush
do
let
talk
about
the
sun
when
you
pass
by
the
ditch
where
janie
is
you
run
very
fast
and
look
at
the
other
side
jude
says
janie
did
love
me
only
she
could
forgive
me
and
that
you
can
love
people
very
much
and
never
never
never
forgive
them
so
we
poked
a
stick
in
the
water
but
only
weeds
came
up
and
an
old
top
with
the
paint
washed
off
jude
and
i
wave
to
the
new
moon
curled
right
up
like
one
gold
hair
on
the
sandhill
mama
peeps
out
the
window
and
smiles
she
thinks
i
am
playing
with
myself
run
jude
run
with
the
wind
but
hold
my
hand
tight
or
the
wind
looking
for
some
one
to
play
with
will
take
me
away
from
you
wind
with
no
one
to
play
with
cooees
the
orange
trees
have
to
nurse
oranges
wind
shouts
to
the
grass
tugs
at
its
roots
but
the
earth
holds
tight
and
the
grass
falls
down
and
wind
boos
over
it
wind
whistles
the
bees
bees
too
busy
with
taking
home
stuff
out
of
flowers
wo
look
back
bees
always
going
somewhere
only
jude
and
i
heads
over
shoulders
watching
all
roads
at
one
time
run
with
the
wind
going
to
nowhere
jude
and
i
were
weeding
our
garden
when
we
heard
his
whip
must
have
been
a
new
whip
to
cut
off
at
one
swing
he
was
the
kind
of
boy
you
knew
when
you
had
celia
with
nice
clothes
on
and
curls
crawling
about
his
collar
like
little
golden
slugs
and
his
man
was
leading
his
horse
i
wish
i
had
run
to
meet
him
if
you
had
run
to
meet
him
he
might
have
trod
on
your
garden
and
said
get
out
of
my
field
you
dirty
little
beggar
he
might
have
struck
you
with
his
whip
how
the
daisies
stared
i
hate
daisies
stupid
white
faces
skinny
necks
craning
over
the
grass
i
said
it
is
not
your
field
and
he
struck
me
again
but
he
did
make
me
run
his
hand
smelled
of
sweet
soap
he
could
shake
me
off
but
his
man
did
funny
how
the
sky
fell
down
and
turned
over
and
over
like
a
blue
carpet
rolling
you
up
and
the
grass
caught
at
your
face
it
could
have
been
spiteful
it
must
have
been
saving
itself
hot
road
silly
wind
playing
with
your
hair
the
road
smelled
of
horses
i
only
got
up
when
i
heard
a
dray
mama
has
sung
ba
ba
black
sheep
and
put
a
chair
with
a
cloth
on
it
between
me
and
the
light
but
the
clock
keeps
saying
dirty
little
beggar
dirty
little
beggar
some
day
i
will
get
that
boy
i
will
pull
off
his
arms
and
legs
and
put
him
in
a
box
and
hide
the
box
under
the
bed
i
wonder
will
he
buzz
when
i
take
him
out
to
look
at
his
body
that
will
have
no
arms
to
whip
me
mama
drew
my
cot
to
the
window
so
i
can
look
at
the
stars
i
will
not
look
at
the
stars
there
is
a
black
chimney
throwing
up
sparks
and
one
tall
flame
like
gold
hair
in
a
blaze
i
know
now
what
i
shall
do
i
will
set
fire
to
him
and
he
will
burn
up
into
a
tall
flame
he
will
scream
into
the
sky
and
sparks
will
fly
out
of
him
he
will
burn
and
burn
and
his
blazing
hair
shall
light
up
the
world
before
he
hit
me
i
knew
he
was
going
to
i
thought
about
jude
i
thought
if
he
fight
but
he
shriveled
all
up
he
lay
down
like
a
fear
mama
never
knew
about
jude
you
always
wanted
to
tell
her
but
somehow
you
never
did
you
were
afraid
she
smile
and
say
he
was
real
that
he
was
only
a
little
because
the
grass
did
fall
down
under
his
feet
he
is
fading
now
he
is
just
lines
like
a
drawing
you
can
see
mama
in
between
when
she
moves
she
rubs
some
of
him
out
monologues
jaguar
nasal
intonations
of
light
and
clicking
tongues
publicity
of
windows
stoning
me
with
cries
smells
of
abattoirs
smells
of
meat
some
while
the
sand
is
yet
cozy
as
a
blanket
off
the
warm
body
of
a
squaw
and
the
jaguars
are
out
to
kill
with
a
night
coming
on
and
a
painted
cloud
stalking
the
first
star
i
shall
go
alone
into
the
silence
the
coiled
silence
where
a
cry
can
run
only
a
little
way
and
waver
and
dwindle
and
be
lost
and
there
where
tiny
antlers
clinch
and
strain
as
life
grapples
in
a
million
avid
points
and
threshing
things
strike
and
die
letting
their
hate
live
on
in
the
spreading
purple
of
a
wound
i
too
will
make
covert
of
a
crevice
in
the
night
and
turn
and
watch
nose
at
the
cleft
edge
wild
duck
i
that
was
a
great
night
we
spied
upon
home
singing
a
hot
sweet
song
to
the
shuffling
off
behind
the
sentimentalizing
on
the
river
lights
dwindling
to
shining
slits
in
the
wet
asphalt
purring
lights
red
and
green
and
digging
daintily
pointed
claws
in
the
soft
mud
but
you
did
not
know
as
the
trains
made
golden
augers
boring
in
the
darkness
how
my
heart
kept
racing
out
along
the
rails
as
a
spider
runs
along
a
thread
and
hauls
him
in
again
to
some
drawing
point
you
did
not
know
how
wild
ducks
wings
itch
at
dawn
how
at
dawn
the
necks
of
wild
ducks
arch
to
the
sun
and
air
trickles
sweet
in
their
gullets
ii
as
water
cleared
of
the
reflection
of
a
bird
that
has
lately
flown
across
it
yet
trembles
with
the
beating
of
its
wings
so
my
soul
emptied
of
the
known
you
utterly
is
yet
vibrant
with
the
cadence
of
the
song
you
might
have
been
was
a
great
night
with
never
a
waste
look
over
a
shoulder
curved
to
the
crook
of
the
wind
and
a
great
word
we
threw
for
memory
to
play
knuckles
with
a
word
the
waters
of
the
world
have
washed
leaving
it
stark
and
without
smell
a
world
that
rattles
well
in
emptiness
the
dream
i
have
a
dream
to
fill
the
golden
sheath
of
a
remembered
day
air
heavy
and
massed
and
blue
as
the
vapor
of
opium
domes
fired
in
sulphurous
mist
sea
quiescent
as
a
gray
seal
and
the
emerging
sun
spurting
up
gold
over
sydney
rising
out
of
the
bay
but
the
day
is
an
cup
and
its
sun
a
junk
of
red
iron
guttering
in
water
where
shall
i
pour
my
dream
altitude
i
wonder
how
it
would
be
here
with
you
where
the
wind
that
has
shaken
off
its
dust
in
low
valleys
touches
one
cleanly
as
with
a
hand
and
pain
is
as
the
remote
hunger
of
droning
things
and
anger
but
a
little
silence
sinking
into
the
great
silence
comrades
life
you
have
been
good
to
me
you
have
not
made
yourself
too
dear
to
juggle
with
nocturne
indigo
bulb
of
darkness
punctured
by
needle
lights
through
a
fissure
of
brick
canyon
shutting
out
stars
and
a
sliver
of
moon
spigoting
two
high
windows
over
the
west
river
boy
i
met
your
eyes
are
two
arcs
shifting
with
my
vision
they
reflect
as
in
a
fading
proof
the
deadened
eyes
of
a
woman
and
your
shed
virginity
light
as
the
withered
pod
of
a
sweet
pea
moist
and
fragrant
blows
against
my
soul
what
are
you
to
me
boy
that
i
who
have
passed
so
many
lights
should
carry
your
eyes
like
swinging
lanterns
cactus
seed
radiant
notes
piercing
my
room
beating
down
through
my
ceiling
smeared
with
unshapen
of
dreams
drifted
out
of
old
smokes
trillions
of
icily
peltering
notes
out
of
just
one
canary
all
grown
to
song
as
a
plant
to
its
stalk
from
too
long

your
notes

you

they
sing
out

such
luminous
notes
they
would
sink
in
the
spirit
lie
germinal
housed
in
the
soul
as
a
seed
in
the
earth
to
break
forth
at
spring
with
the
crocuses
into
young
smiles
on
the

glancing
off
buoyantly
radiate
notes
in

you

with

up

about

flaming
points
that
fling

up
in

did
you
enter
my

from

wound
brushing
mine
in

i
snare
you
on
my
sharper
edges
as
a
bird
flying
through
cobwebbed
trees
at
carries
off
spiders
on
its
wings
secrets
running
over
my
soul
without
sound
only
when
dawn
comes
ushered
by
a
suave
wind
and
dreams
disintegrate
like
breath
shapes
in
frosty
air
i
shall
overhear
you
scatting
off
into
the
darkness
i
shall
know
you
secrets
by
the
litter
you
have
left
and
by
your
bloody
potpourri
do
you
remember
moon
dripping
thick
sweet
light
where
canal
street
saunters
off
by
herself
among
quiet
trees
and
the
faint
decayed
patchouli
fragrance
of
new

upheld
in

to
myself
sedately

too
dance
over

they
laugh
back
at

look
askance
at

moonlight
turning
harsh
things
to
beauty

that
little
wry
souls
reflecting
each
other
obliquely
as
in
cracked
mirrors
beheld
in
your
luminous
spirit
their
own
reflection
transfigured
as
in
a
shining
stream
and
loved
you
for
what
they
are
not
you
are
less
an
image
in
my
mind
than
a
luster
i
see
you
in
gleams
pale
as
on
a
gray
wall
evanescent
as
the
reflection
of
a
white
swan
shimmering
in
broken
water
ii
to
you
inevitable
unwieldy
with
enormous
births
lying
on

sucking
down

you
kissing

picking
over
fresh
deaths

gestation
of
dark
water
germinal
with

off

of

black
night
centuries

we
beat
at
a
door
in
gilead
we
took
the
levite
concubine
we
plucked
her
hands
from
off
the
door
we
choked
the
cry
into
her
throat
and
stuck
the
stars
among
her
hair
we
glimpsed
the
madly
swaying
stars
between
the
rhythms
of
her
hair
and
all
our
mute
and
separate
strings
swelled
in
a
raging
symphony
our
blood
sang
paeans
all
that
night
till
dawn
fell
like
a
wounded
swan
upon
the
fields
of
gilead

we
are

epics
tingled
in
our
blood

over
the
stones
in
alexandria
could
we
loose
the
wild
rhythms
clinched
in
us
march
in
bands
of
troubadours
we
would
be
of
gentle
mood
when
christ
healed
us
who
were
dumb
when
he
freed
our
song
we
strewed
green
palms
at
his
pale
feet
we
sang
hosannas
in
jerusalem
and
all
our
fumbling
voices
blent
in
a
brief
white
harmony
but
a
mightier
song
was
in
us
pent
when
we
nailed
christ
to
a
tree

are
young
when
we
rise
up
with
singing
roots

rains

night

nimble
rats
of
song
in
our
feet

all
is

trample

floats
as

not

yours
would
close

why
i
do
not

i
have
a
sense
of

your

hurt
me
mysterious
openings
in
the
gray
stone
of
your

through
which
your

streams
out
taut
as
a
flag
bearing
strange
symbols
to
the

if
i
stay
projected
trembling
against

filtering

your

that
bore
their

through

stop
as
at

grow
warm

luminous

i
can
not
stay
for
the

i
know
how
the
days
pass
the
prison
squats
with
granite
haunches
on
the
young
spring
battened
under
with
its
twisting
green
and
you
socket
for
every
bolt
piercing
like
a
driven
nail
eyes
stare
you
through
the
bars
eyes
blank
as
a
graveled
yard
and
the
silence
shuffles
heavy
dice
of
feet
in
iron
corridors
until
the
day
that
has
soiled
herself
in
this
black
hole
to
caress
the
pale
mask
of
your
face
withdraws
the
last
wizened
ray
to
wash
in
the

her
discolored
hands

you
hear
me
sasha
in
your
surrounded
darkness

how
should
they

you

walk
up

against
the

standing

off

measure
your
circumference

warped
with

askew

shrunken

not
looking

your
shadow
swaying
from

that
you
should
be
walking
free
you
shut
down
without
light
and
your
legs
tied
up

a
knot
of

about

by

your

bloody
as
the
sunset

your
shadow
gaunt
upon

of
you
that
life
is
crushing
for
their
frantic

rising
in
the

wind
rising
in
the
alleys
my
spirit
lifts
in
you
like
a
banner
streaming
free
of
hot
walls
you
are
full
of
unspent
dreams
you
are
laden
with
beginnings
there
is
hope
in
you
not
sweet
acrid
as
blood
in
the
mouth
come
into
my
tossing
dust
scattering
the
peace
of
old
deaths
wind
rising
in
the
alleys
carrying
stuff
of
flame
