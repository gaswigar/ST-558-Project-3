chapter
i
spring
in
the
train
his
was
the
first
figure
to
catch
my
eye
that
evening
in
petrograd
he
stood
under
the
dusky
lamp
in
the
vast
gloomy
warsaw
station
with
exactly
the
expression
that
i
was
afterwards
to
know
so
well
impressed
not
only
upon
his
face
but
also
upon
the
awkwardness
of
his
arms
that
hung
stiffly
at
his
side
upon
the
baggy
looseness
of
his
trousers
at
the
knees
the
unfastened
straps
of
his
long
black
military
boots
his
face
with
its
mild
blue
eyes
straggly
fair
moustache
expressed
anxiety
and
pride
timidity
and
happiness
apprehension
and
confidence
he
was
in
that
first
moment
of
my
sight
of
him
as
helpless
as
unpractical
and
as
anxious
to
please
as
any
lost
dog
in
the
world
and
he
was
also
as
proud
as
lucifer
i
knew
him
at
once
for
an
englishman
his
russian
uniform
only
accented
the
small
atmosphere
of
his
appearance
he
was
exactly
what
i
had
expected
he
was
not
however
alone
and
that
surprised
me
by
his
side
stood
a
girl
obviously
russian
wearing
her
sister
uniform
with
excitement
and
eager
anticipation
her
eyes
turning
restlessly
from
one
part
of
the
platform
to
another
listening
with
an
impatient
smile
to
the
remarks
of
her
companion
from
where
i
stood
i
could
hear
his
clumsy
hesitating
russian
and
her
swift
preoccupied
replies
i
came
up
to
them
mr
trenchard
i
asked
he
blushed
stammered
held
out
his
hand
missed
mine
blushed
the
more
laughed
nervously
i
glad
i
knew
i
hope
i
could
feel
that
the
girl
eyes
were
upon
me
with
all
the
excited
interest
of
one
who
is
expecting
that
every
moment
of
her
new
wonderful
experience
will
be
of
a
stupendous
even
immortal
quality
i
am
sister
marie
ivanovna
and
you
are
of
course
durward
she
said
they
are
all
waiting
for
you
expecting
you
you
late
you
know
she
laughed
and
moved
forward
as
though
she
would
accompany
me
to
the
group
by
the
train
we
went
to
the
train
together
i
should
tell
you
she
said
quickly
and
suddenly
with
nervousness
that
we
are
engaged
trenchard
and
i
only
last
night
we
have
been
working
at
the
same
hospital
i
do
know
any
one
she
continued
in
the
same
intimate
confiding
whisper
i
would
be
frightened
terribly
if
i
were
not
so
excited
ah
there
anna
mihailovna
i
know
of
course
it
was
through
her
aunt
the
one
who
on
princess
soboleff
train
that
i
had
the
chance
of
going
with
you
oh
i
so
happy
that
i
had
the
chance
if
i
had
had
it
we
were
soon
engulfed
now
i
drew
a
deep
breath
and
surrendered
myself
the
tall
energetic
figure
of
anna
mihailovna
the
lady
to
whose
practical
business
gifts
and
unlimited
capacity
for
compelling
her
friends
to
surrender
their
last
bow
and
button
in
her
service
we
owed
the
existence
of
our
red
cross
unit
was
to
be
seen
like
a
splendid
flag
waving
its
followers
on
to
glory
and
devotion
we
devoted
all
of
us
even
i
whose
second
departure
to
the
war
this
was
had
after
the
feeblest
resistance
surrendered
myself
to
the
drama
of
the
occasion
i
should
have
been
no
gentleman
had
i
done
otherwise
after
the
waters
had
closed
above
my
head
for
perhaps
five
minutes
of
strangled
surrender
i
was
suddenly
compelled
by
what
agency
i
know
not
to
struggle
to
the
surface
to
look
around
me
and
then
quite
instantly
to
forget
my
immersion
the
figure
of
trenchard
standing
exactly
as
i
had
left
him
his
hands
uneasily
at
his
sides
a
smile
on
his
lips
his
eyes
staring
straight
in
front
of
him
absolutely
compelled
my
attention
i
had
forgotten
him
we
had
all
forgotten
him
his
own
lady
had
forgotten
him
i
withdrew
from
the
struggling
noisy
group
and
stepped
back
to
his
side
it
was
then
that
as
i
now
most
clearly
remember
i
was
conscious
of
something
else
was
aware
that
there
was
a
strange
faint
blue
light
in
the
dark
clumsy
station
a
faint
throbbing
glow
that
like
the
reflection
of
blue
water
on
a
sunlit
ceiling
hovered
and
hung
above
the
ugly
shabbiness
of
the
engines
and
trucks
the
rails
with
scattered
pieces
of
paper
here
and
there
the
iron
arms
that
supported
the
vast
glass
roof
the
hideous
funnel
that
hung
with
its
gaping
mouth
above
the
the
faint
blue
light
was
the
spring
evening
the
spring
evening
that
encouraged
by
god
knows
what
brave
illusion
had
penetrated
even
these
desperate
fastnesses
a
little
breeze
accompanied
it
and
the
dirty
pieces
of
paper
blew
to
and
fro
then
suddenly
a
shaft
of
light
quivered
upon
the
blackness
quivered
and
spread
like
a
golden
fan
then
flooded
the
huge
cave
with
trembling
ripples
of
light
there
was
even
i
dare
swear
at
this
safe
distance
a
smell
of
flowers
in
the
air
it
a
most
lovely
trenchard
said
smiling
at
me
spring
here
i
find
i
was
compelled
by
some
unexpected
sense
of
fatherly
duty
to
be
practical
you
got
your
things
i
said
you
found
your
seat
well
i
did
know
he
stammered
where
are
they
i
asked
him
he
was
not
quite
sure
where
they
were
he
stood
waving
his
hands
whilst
the
golden
sunlight
rippled
over
his
face
i
was
suddenly
irritated
but
please
i
said
there
is
much
time
four
of
us
men
have
a
compartment
together
just
show
me
where
your
things
are
and
then
introduce
you
he
seemed
reluctant
to
move
as
though
the
spot
that
he
had
chosen
was
the
only
safe
one
in
the
whole
station
but
i
forced
him
forward
found
his
bags
had
them
placed
in
their
carriage
then
turned
to
introduce
him
to
his
companions
anna
mihailovna
had
said
to
me
this
detachment
will
be
older
than
the
last
doctor
nikitin
he
take
that
other
doctor
place
the
one
who
had
typhus
and
andrey
vassilievitch
you
known
him
for
years
he
talks
a
great
deal
but
he
sympathetic
and
such
a
good
business
man
he
be
useful
then
there
an
englishman
i
know
much
about
him
except
that
he
been
working
for
three
months
at
the
english
hospital
he
not
a
correspondent
never
written
a
line
in
his
life
i
only
saw
him
for
a
moment
but
he
seemed
sympathetic
anna
mihailovna
as
is
well
known
to
all
of
us
finds
every
one
sympathetic
simply
because
she
has
so
much
to
do
and
so
many
people
to
see
that
she
has
no
time
to
go
deeply
into
things
if
you
have
no
time
for
judging
character
you
must
have
some
good
common
rule
to
go
by
i
had
known
little
andrey
vassilievitch
for
some
years
and
had
found
him
tiresome
finally
i
did
not
care
about
the
possibility
of
an
englishman
perhaps
i
had
wished
through
pride
to
remain
the
only
englishman
in
our
otriad
i
had
made
friends
with
them
all
i
was
at
home
with
them
another
englishman
might
transplant
me
in
their
affections
russians
transfer
with
the
greatest
ease
their
emotions
from
one
place
to
another
or
he
might
be
a
failure
and
so
damage
my
country
reputation
some
such
vain
and
stupid
prejudice
i
had
i
know
that
i
looked
upon
our
new
additions
with
disfavour
there
at
any
rate
nikitin
and
little
andrey
vassilievitch
were
and
a
strange
contrast
they
made
nikitin
size
would
have
compelled
attention
anywhere
even
in
russia
which
is
of
course
a
country
of
big
men
it
was
not
only
that
he
was
tall
and
broad
the
carriage
of
his
head
the
deep
blackness
of
his
beard
his
eyebrows
his
eyes
the
sure
independence
with
which
he
held
himself
as
though
he
were
indifferent
to
the
whole
world
and
that
i
know
that
he
was
must
anywhere
have
made
him
remarked
and
remembered
he
looked
now
immensely
fine
in
his
uniform
which
admirably
suited
him
he
stood
without
his
greatcoat
his
hand
on
his
sword
his
eyes
as
though
he
were
almost
asleep
and
a
faint
on
his
face
as
though
he
were
amused
at
his
thoughts
i
remember
that
my
first
impression
of
him
was
that
he
was
so
completely
beneath
the
domination
of
some
idea
or
remembrance
that
at
that
moment
no
human
being
could
touch
him
when
i
took
trenchard
up
to
him
i
was
so
conscious
of
his
remoteness
that
i
was
embarrassed
and
apologetic
and
if
i
was
aware
of
nikitin
remoteness
i
was
equally
conscious
of
andrey
vassilievitch
proximity
he
was
a
little
man
of
a
round
plump
figure
he
wore
a
little
imperial
and
sharp
inquisitive
moustaches
his
hair
was
light
brown
and
he
was
immensely
proud
of
it
in
petrograd
he
was
always
very
smartly
dressed
he
bought
his
clothes
in
london
and
his
plump
hands
had
a
movement
familiar
to
all
his
friends
a
flicker
of
his
hands
to
his
coat
his
waistcoat
his
trousers
to
brush
off
some
imaginary
speck
of
dust
it
was
obvious
now
that
he
had
given
very
much
thought
to
his
uniform
it
fitted
him
perfectly
his
epaulettes
glittered
his
boots
shone
his
sword
was
magnificent
but
he
looked
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
exactly
what
he
was
a
rich
successful
merchant
never
was
there
any
one
less
military
he
had
dressed
up
one
might
suppose
for
some
ball
i
could
see
at
once
that
he
was
ill
at
ease
anxious
as
ever
to
please
every
one
to
like
every
one
to
be
liked
in
return
but
unable
because
of
some
thought
that
troubled
him
to
give
his
whole
attention
to
this
business
of
pleasing
he
greeted
me
with
a
warmth
that
was
really
genuine
although
he
bestowed
it
upon
his
merest
acquaintances
his
great
dream
in
life
was
a
universal
popularity
that
every
one
should
love
him
at
any
rate
at
that
time
i
thought
that
to
be
his
dream
i
know
now
that
there
was
something
else
but
ivan
petrovitch
this
is
delightful
here
we
all
are
what
pleasure
thank
god
we
all
here
no
delays
nothing
unfortunate
an
englishman
indeed
i
am
very
glad
your
friend
speaks
russian
not
very
much
but
enough
you
know
vladimir
stepanovitch
nikitin
my
friend
meester
durward
also
meester
ah
i
beg
your
pardon
tronsart
two
englishmen
in
our
otriad
the
alliance
yes
delightful
nikitin
slowly
opened
his
eyes
shook
hands
with
me
and
with
trenchard
said
that
he
was
glad
to
see
us
and
was
silent
again
trenchard
stammered
and
blushed
said
something
in
very
bad
russian
then
glanced
anxiously
with
an
eager
light
in
his
mild
blue
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
excited
crowd
that
chattered
and
stirred
about
the
train
there
was
something
in
that
look
of
his
that
both
touched
and
irritated
me
what
does
he
come
for
i
thought
to
myself
with
his
bad
russian
and
his
english
prejudices
of
course
he
be
lonely
and
then
he
be
in
every
one
way
i
could
remember
readily
enough
some
of
the
loneliness
of
those
first
months
of
my
own
when
both
war
and
the
russians
had
differed
so
from
my
expectations
this
fellow
looked
just
the
figure
for
high
romantic
pictures
he
had
doubtless
seen
russia
in
the
colours
of
the
pleasant
superficial
books
of
travel
that
have
of
late
in
england
been
so
popular
books
that
see
in
the
russian
a
blessed
sort
of
idiot
unable
to
read
or
write
but
vitally
conscious
of
god
and
in
russia
a
land
of
snow
ikons
mushrooms
and
pilgrims
yes
he
would
be
disappointed
unhappy
and
tiresome
upon
myself
would
fall
the
chief
burden
of
his
trouble
i
should
have
enough
upon
my
shoulders
without
him
the
golden
fan
had
vanished
from
the
station
walls
a
dim
pale
glow
with
sparkles
as
of
gold
dust
shining
here
and
there
upon
that
grimy
world
faltered
and
trembled
before
the
rattle
and
roar
that
threatened
it
nevertheless
spring
was
with
us
at
our
departure
as
the
bells
rang
as
the
ladies
of
our
committee
screamed
and
laughed
as
anna
mihailovna
showered
directions
and
advice
upon
us
as
we
crowded
backwards
into
our
compartment
before
the
first
jolt
of
the
departing
train
spring
was
with
us
but
of
course
we
were
all
of
us
too
busy
to
be
aware
of
it
nikitin
i
remember
reduced
us
very
quickly
for
all
practical
purposes
to
a
company
of
three
he
lowered
one
of
the
upper
beds
climbed
into
it
stretched
himself
out
and
lay
in
silence
staring
at
the
his
body
was
a
shadow
in
the
touched
once
and
again
by
the
gesture
of
the
swinging
lamp
that
swept
him
out
of
darkness
and
back
into
it
again
the
remaining
three
of
us
did
not
during
either
that
evening
or
the
next
day
make
much
progress
at
times
there
would
of
course
be
tea
and
then
the
two
sisters
who
were
in
a
compartment
close
at
hand
joined
us
marie
ivanovna
trenchard
lady
was
quieter
than
she
had
been
before
her
face
which
now
seemed
younger
than
ever
wore
a
look
of
important
seriousness
as
though
she
were
conscious
of
the
indecency
of
her
earlier
excitement
she
spoke
very
little
but
no
one
could
be
in
her
presence
without
feeling
the
force
of
her
vitality
like
some
hammer
silent
but
of
immense
power
beating
relentlessly
upon
the
atmosphere
its
effect
was
the
stronger
in
that
one
realised
how
utterly
at
present
she
was
unable
to
deal
with
it
her
very
helplessness
was
half
of
her
power
half
of
her
danger
too
she
was
most
certainly
not
beautiful
her
nose
was
too
short
her
mouth
too
large
her
forehead
from
which
her
black
hair
was
brushed
straight
back
too
high
her
complexion
was
pale
and
when
she
was
confused
excited
or
pleased
the
colour
came
into
her
face
in
a
faint
flush
that
ebbed
and
flowed
but
never
reached
its
full
glow
her
hands
were
thin
and
pale
it
was
her
eyes
that
made
her
so
young
they
were
so
large
and
round
and
credulous
scornful
sometimes
with
the
scorn
of
the
very
young
for
all
the
things
in
the
world
that
they
have
not
experienced
but
young
especially
in
all
their
urgent
capacity
for
life
in
their
confidence
of
carrying
through
all
the
demands
that
the
high
gods
might
make
upon
them
i
knew
as
i
looked
at
her
that
at
present
her
eagerness
for
experience
was
stronger
by
far
than
her
eagerness
for
any
single
human
being
i
wondered
whether
trenchard
knew
that
he
was
beyond
discussion
most
desperately
in
love
the
love
of
a
shy
man
who
has
for
so
many
years
wondered
and
dreamed
and
finds
when
the
reality
comes
to
him
that
it
is
more
far
more
than
he
had
expected
when
she
came
in
to
us
he
sat
very
quietly
by
her
side
and
talked
if
he
talked
at
all
to
the
other
sister
a
stout
comfortable
woman
with
no
illusions
no
expectations
immense
capacity
and
an
intensely
serious
attitude
to
food
and
drink
trenchard
let
his
eyes
rest
upon
his
lady
face
whenever
she
was
unaware
but
i
could
see
that
he
was
desperately
anxious
not
to
offend
her
his
attitude
to
all
women
even
to
anna
petrovna
the
motherly
sister
was
that
of
a
man
who
has
always
blundered
in
their
company
who
has
been
mocked
perhaps
for
his
mistakes
i
could
see
however
that
his
pride
in
his
new
possession
his
pride
and
his
happiness
carried
with
it
an
absolute
assurance
of
his
security
he
had
no
doubts
at
all
he
seemed
in
this
even
younger
than
she
through
all
that
long
spring
day
we
wandered
on
wandering
it
seemed
as
the
train
picked
its
way
through
the
fields
under
a
sky
of
blue
thin
and
fine
like
glass
through
a
world
so
quiet
and
still
that
birds
and
children
sang
and
called
as
though
to
reassure
themselves
that
they
were
not
alone
nothing
of
the
war
in
all
this
at
the
stations
there
were
officers
eating
ztchee
soup
and
veal
and
drinking
glasses
of
weak
tea
there
were
endless
mountains
of
hot
meat
pies
the
ikons
in
the
restaurants
looked
down
with
benignancy
and
indifference
upon
the
food
and
the
soldiers
and
beyond
the
station
the
light
green
trees
blowing
in
the
little
wind
the
choruses
of
the
soldiers
came
from
their
trains
as
though
it
were
the
very
voice
of
spring
itself
it
sounded
in
the
distance
like
barinisha
pop
barinisha
pop
so
la
la
la
bar
inisha
the
bell
rang
officers
with
meat
pies
in
their
hands
came
running
across
the
platform
we
swung
on
again
through
the
green
golden
day
andrey
vassilievitch
of
course
chattered
to
us
all
it
was
his
way
and
after
a
very
brief
experience
of
it
one
trained
oneself
to
regard
it
as
an
inevitable
background
like
the
jerking
and
smoke
of
the
train
the
dust
the
shrill
russian
voices
in
the
next
compartment
the
blowing
of
paper
to
and
fro
in
the
corridor
i
very
quickly
discovered
that
he
was
intensely
conscious
of
nikitin
who
scarcely
throughout
the
day
moved
from
his
upper
bunk
andrey
vassilievitch
handed
him
his
tea
brought
his
meat
pies
and
sandwiches
from
the
station
and
offered
him
newspapers
he
did
not
however
speak
to
him
and
i
was
aware
that
throughout
that
long
day
he
was
never
once
unconscious
of
him
his
chatter
which
was
always
the
most
irrepressible
thing
in
the
world
had
perhaps
some
direction
behind
it
for
the
first
time
in
my
long
acquaintance
with
andrey
vassilievitch
he
interested
me
the
little
man
was
distressed
by
the
heat
and
dirt
his
fingers
were
always
flickering
about
his
clothes
he
was
intensely
polite
to
every
one
especially
to
trenchard
paying
him
many
compliments
about
england
and
the
english
the
english
were
the
only
sportsmen
in
the
world
he
had
been
once
in
london
for
a
week
it
had
rained
very
much
but
one
afternoon
it
had
been
fine
and
then
what
clothes
he
had
seen
but
the
city
he
had
been
down
into
the
city
and
was
lost
in
admiration
he
had
also
been
lost
in
practical
earnest
and
had
appealed
to
one
of
the
splendid
policemen
as
to
the
way
to
holborn
viaduct
a
name
that
he
was
quite
unable
to
pronounce
this
incident
he
told
us
several
times
meanwhile
he
hoped
he
might
ask
without
offence
what
was
our
navy
doing
why
were
our
submarines
as
active
as
the
german
submarines
and
in
france
how
many
soldiers
had
we
now
he
did
hope
that
he
was
not
offending
he
spoke
rapidly
and
indistinctly
and
much
of
his
conversation
trenchard
did
not
understand
he
made
some
rather
stupid
replies
and
marie
ivanovna
laughed
she
spoke
english
very
well
with
an
accent
that
was
charming
she
had
had
she
said
an
english
nurse
and
then
an
english
governess
of
course
they
asked
me
many
questions
about
the
future
would
we
be
close
to
the
front
how
many
versts
would
there
be
plenty
of
work
and
would
we
see
things
we
wanted
to
be
useful
no
use
going
if
we
were
not
to
be
useful
how
many
sisters
were
there
then
already
were
they
sympathetic
was
molozov
the
head
of
the
otriad
an
agreeable
man
was
he
kind
or
would
he
be
angry
about
simply
nothing
who
would
bandage
and
who
would
feed
the
villagers
and
who
would
bathe
the
soldiers
were
the
officers
of
the
ninth
army
pleasant
to
us
where
who
when
the
day
slipped
away
the
colours
were
drawn
from
the
sky
the
fields
the
hills
the
stars
came
out
in
their
myriads
thickly
clustered
in
ropes
and
lakes
and
coils
of
light
the
air
was
scented
with
flowers
the
second
night
passed
the
greater
part
of
the
next
day
was
spent
in
h
a
snug
town
with
a
little
park
like
a
clean
handkerchief
streets
with
coloured
shops
neat
and
like
toys
from
a
little
blue
trains
statues
of
bewigged
kings
and
dukes
and
a
restaurant
painted
with
bright
green
groves
ladies
in
hoops
and
powder
and
sheep
here
we
wandered
five
of
us
nikitin
told
us
that
he
would
meet
us
at
the
station
that
evening
he
had
his
own
business
in
the
place
the
little
town
was
delivered
over
to
the
russian
army
but
seemed
happy
enough
in
its
deliverance
i
have
never
realised
in
any
place
more
completely
the
spirit
of
bright
cheerfulness
and
the
soldiers
who
thronged
the
little
streets
were
as
far
from
alarm
and
thunder
as
the
painted
sheep
in
the
restaurant
marie
ivanovna
was
as
excited
as
though
she
had
never
been
in
a
town
before
she
bought
a
number
of
things
in
the
little
expensive
shops
sweets
an
electric
lamp
a
and
some
preserved
fruit
trenchard
made
her
presents
she
thanked
him
with
a
gratitude
that
made
him
so
happy
that
he
stumbled
over
his
sword
more
than
ever
blushing
and
pushing
his
cap
back
from
his
head
there
are
some
who
might
have
laughed
at
him
carrying
her
parcels
his
face
flushed
his
legs
knocking
against
one
another
but
it
was
here
at
h
that
for
the
first
time
i
positively
began
to
like
him
by
the
evening
when
we
were
assembled
in
the
station
again
as
i
looked
at
him
standing
waiting
for
directions
smiling
hot
untidy
and
awkward
i
knew
that
i
liked
him
very
much
indeed
our
new
train
overflowed
with
the
greatest
difficulty
we
secured
a
small
wooden
compartment
with
seats
sharp
and
narrow
and
a
smell
of
cabbage
bad
tobacco
and
dirty
clothes
the
floor
was
littered
with
sunflower
seeds
and
the
paper
wrappings
of
cheap
sweets
the
air
came
in
hot
stale
gusts
down
the
corridor
met
the
yet
closer
air
of
our
carriage
battled
with
it
and
retired
defeated
we
flung
open
the
windows
and
a
cloud
of
dust
rose
gaily
to
meet
us
the
whole
of
the
russian
army
seemed
to
be
surging
upon
the
platform
orderlies
were
searching
for
their
masters
officers
shouting
for
their
orderlies
soldiers
staggering
along
under
bundles
of
clothes
and
rugs
and
pillows
here
a
group
standing
patiently
each
man
with
his
kettle
and
on
his
face
that
expression
of
happy
wholly
amiable
tolerance
which
reveals
the
russian
soldier
favourite
attitude
to
the
world
two
priests
with
wide
dirty
black
hats
long
hair
and
soiled
grey
gowns
slowly
found
their
way
through
the
crowd
a
bunch
of
austrian
prisoners
in
their
uniform
made
a
strange
splash
of
colour
in
a
corner
of
the
platform
where
very
contentedly
they
were
drinking
their
tea
some
one
in
the
invisible
distance
was
playing
the
balalaïka
and
every
now
and
then
some
church
bell
in
the
town
rang
clearly
and
sharply
above
the
tumult
the
thin
films
of
dust
yellow
in
the
evening
sun
hovered
like
golden
smoke
under
the
station
roof
at
last
with
a
reluctant
jerk
and
shiver
the
train
was
slowly
persuaded
to
totter
into
the
evening
air
the
evening
scents
were
again
around
us
the
balalaïka
now
upon
the
train
hummed
behind
us
as
we
pushed
out
upon
her
last
night
journey
the
two
sisters
had
the
seats
by
the
windows
nikitin
curled
up
his
great
length
in
another
corner
and
andrey
vassilievitch
settled
himself
with
much
grunting
and
many
exclamations
beside
him
i
and
trenchard
sat
stiffly
on
the
other
side
i
had
long
ago
accustomed
myself
to
sleep
in
any
position
on
any
occasion
however
sudden
it
might
be
and
i
fancied
that
i
should
now
in
a
moment
be
asleep
although
i
had
never
in
my
long
travelling
experience
known
greater
discomfort
i
looked
at
the
dim
lamp
at
the
square
patch
beyond
the
windows
at
nikitin
long
body
which
seemed
nevertheless
so
perfectly
comfortable
and
at
andrey
short
fat
one
which
was
so
obviously
miserably
uncomfortable
i
smelt
the
cabbage
the
dust
the
sunflower
seeds
first
one
bone
then
another
ached
in
the
centre
of
my
back
there
was
an
intolerable
irritation
above
all
there
was
in
my
brain
some
strange
insistent
compulsion
as
though
some
one
were
forcing
me
to
remember
something
that
i
had
forgotten
or
as
though
again
some
one
were
me
of
some
peril
or
complication
i
had
very
distinctly
that
impression
so
familiar
to
all
of
us
of
passing
through
some
experience
already
known
i
had
seen
already
the
dim
lamp
the
square
patch
of
evening
sky
nikitin
andrey
vassilievitch
i
knew
that
in
a
moment
trenchard
he
did
he
touched
my
arm
can
you
sleep
he
whispered
no
i
answered
it
terribly
hot
close
smell
are
you
going
to
sleep
no
i
whispered
back
again
let
us
move
into
the
corridor
it
will
be
cooler
there
there
seemed
to
me
quite
a
new
sound
of
determination
and
resolve
in
his
voice
his
nervousness
had
left
him
with
the
daylight
he
led
the
way
out
of
the
carriage
turned
down
the
little
seats
in
the
corridor
provided
cigarettes
it
is
much
better
here
but
we
have
the
window
open
it
get
better
this
is
really
war
is
it
being
so
uncomfortable
as
this
i
feel
as
though
things
were
really
beginning
well
we
shall
be
there
night
i
answered
him
i
hope
you
not
going
to
be
disappointed
disappointed
in
what
his
voice
was
quite
sharp
as
he
spoke
to
me
you
do
know
what
i
want
i
suppose
you
like
the
rest
of
us
you
want
to
see
what
war
really
is
you
want
to
do
some
good
if
you
can
you
want
to
be
seriously
occupied
in
it
to
prevent
your
thinking
too
much
about
it
then
because
you
english
you
want
to
see
what
the
russians
are
really
like
you
curious
and
sympathetic
inquisitive
and
perhaps
a
little
sentimental
about
it
am
i
right
no
not
quite
there
are
other
things
i
like
to
tell
you
do
you
mind
he
said
suddenly
looking
up
straight
into
my
face
with
a
confiding
smile
that
was
especially
his
own
if
i
talk
if
i
tell
you
why
i
come
i
no
right
i
do
know
you
but
i
so
happy
that
i
talk
i
so
happy
that
i
feel
as
though
i
shall
never
get
through
the
night
alive
of
our
conversation
after
this
or
rather
of
talk
excited
eager
intimate
and
shy
old
and
wise
and
very
very
young
i
remember
now
i
think
every
word
with
especial
vividness
after
events
were
to
fix
it
all
in
my
brain
with
peculiar
accuracy
but
his
narration
had
that
night
of
itself
its
own
individual
quality
his
was
no
ordinary
personality
or
at
any
rate
the
especial
circumstances
of
the
time
drove
it
into
no
ordinary
shape
and
i
believe
that
never
before
in
all
his
days
had
he
spoken
freely
and
eagerly
to
any
one
it
was
simply
his
exultation
and
happiness
that
impelled
him
perhaps
also
some
sense
of
high
adventure
that
his
romantic
character
would
most
inevitably
extract
from
our
expedition
and
its
purposes
at
any
rate
i
listened
saying
a
word
now
and
then
whilst
the
hour
grew
dark
lit
only
by
the
stars
then
trembled
into
a
pale
dawn
overladen
with
grey
dense
clouds
which
again
broke
rolled
away
before
another
shining
glittering
morning
i
remember
that
it
was
broad
daylight
when
we
at
last
left
the
corridor
i
he
said
i
do
feel
it
of
course
i
seem
to
be
now
only
just
beginning
life
i
a
very
unpractical
person
and
in
that
way
perhaps
i
younger
than
my
age
i
remember
that
i
said
something
to
him
about
his
most
certainly
appearing
younger
most
certainly
i
do
i
just
the
same
as
when
i
went
up
to
cambridge
and
i
was
then
as
when
i
first
went
to
rugby
nothing
seems
to
have
had
any
effect
upon
me
except
perhaps
these
last
two
days
do
you
know
glebeshire
he
asked
me
abruptly
i
said
that
i
had
spent
one
summer
there
with
a
reading
party
ah
he
answered
smiling
i
can
tell
by
the
way
you
say
that
that
you
do
really
know
it
at
all
to
us
glebeshire
people
impossible
to
speak
of
it
so
easily
there
are
trenchards
all
over
glebeshire
you
know
lots
of
them
in
polchester
our
cathedral
town
where
i
was
born
there
are
at
least
four
trenchard
families
then
in
truxe
at
garth
at
rasselas
at
clinton
but
why
should
i
bother
you
with
all
this
it
only
to
tell
you
that
the
trenchards
are
simply
glebeshire
for
ever
and
ever
to
a
trenchard
anywhere
in
the
world
glebeshire
is
hearth
and
home
i
believe
i
met
i
said
your
trenchards
of
garth
george
trenchard
she
was
a
faunder
they
have
a
house
in
westminster
there
a
charming
miss
trenchard
with
whom
i
danced
yes
those
are
the
george
trenchards
he
answered
with
eagerness
and
delight
as
though
i
had
formed
a
new
link
with
him
fancy
your
knowing
them
how
small
the
world
is
my
father
was
a
cousin
a
first
cousin
of
george
trenchard
the
girl
you
must
mean
millie
is
delightful
katherine
the
elder
sister
is
married
now
she
too
is
charming
but
in
a
different
graver
way
he
spoke
of
them
all
with
a
serious
lingering
pleasure
as
though
he
were
summoning
them
all
into
the
dusty
stuffy
corridor
carrying
them
with
him
into
these
strange
countries
and
perilous
adventures
they
always
laughed
at
me
millie
especially
i
stayed
sometimes
with
them
at
garth
but
i
did
mean
really
to
talk
about
i
only
wanted
to
show
you
how
deeply
glebeshire
matters
to
the
trenchards
and
whatever
happens
wherever
a
trenchard
goes
he
always
really
takes
glebeshire
with
him
i
was
born
in
polchester
as
i
said
my
father
had
a
little
property
there
but
we
always
lived
in
a
little
round
house
in
the
cathedral
close
i
was
simply
brought
up
on
the
cathedral
from
my
bedroom
windows
i
looked
on
the
whole
of
it
in
our
you
could
hear
the
booming
of
the
organ
i
was
always
watching
the
canons
crossing
the
cathedral
green
counting
the
strokes
of
the
cathedral
bell
listening
to
the
cawing
of
the
cathedral
rooks
smelling
the
cathedral
smell
of
cold
stone
wet
umbrellas
and
dusty
hassocks
looking
up
at
the
high
tower
and
wondering
whether
anywhere
in
the
world
there
was
anything
so
grand
and
fine
my
moral
world
too
was
built
on
the
cathedral
on
the
cathedral
and
on
the
cathedral
hours
and
the
cathedral
prayers
and
the
cathedral
ambitions
and
disappointments
my
father
great
passion
was
golf
he
was
not
a
religious
man
but
my
mother
believed
in
the
cathedral
with
a
passion
that
was
almost
a
disease
she
died
looking
at
it
her
spirit
is
somewhere
round
it
now
i
do
believe
he
paused
then
went
on
it
was
the
cathedral
that
made
me
so
unpractical
i
suppose
i
who
am
an
only
child
i
believed
implicitly
in
what
i
was
told
and
it
always
was
my
mother
who
told
me
everything
he
was
i
thought
the
very
simplest
person
to
whom
i
had
ever
listened
the
irritation
that
i
had
already
felt
on
several
occasions
in
his
company
again
returned
my
father
great
passion
was
golf
would
surely
in
the
mouth
of
another
have
had
some
tinge
of
irony
in
trenchard
mild
blue
eyes
irony
was
an
incredible
element
i
could
fancy
what
he
would
have
to
say
to
the
very
gentlest
of
cynics
some
of
the
sympathy
i
had
felt
for
him
during
the
afternoon
had
left
me
he
very
little
short
of
an
idiot
i
thought
he
going
to
be
dreadfully
in
the
way
i
was
the
only
child
you
see
he
continued
of
course
i
was
a
great
deal
to
my
mother
and
she
to
me
we
were
always
together
i
do
think
that
even
when
i
was
very
young
i
believed
all
that
she
told
me
she
seemed
to
me
always
to
take
everything
for
granted
heaven
to
me
was
so
mysterious
and
she
had
such
definite
knowledge
i
always
liked
things
to
be
indefinite
i
do
still
he
laughed
paused
for
a
moment
but
was
plainly
now
off
on
his
fine
white
horse
charging
the
air
to
be
stopped
by
no
mortal
challenge
i
had
for
a
moment
the
thought
that
i
would
slip
from
my
seat
and
leave
him
i
did
believe
that
he
would
have
noticed
my
absence
but
the
thought
of
that
small
stuffy
carriage
held
me
but
he
conscious
of
me
like
the
ancient
mariner
he
fixed
upon
my
arm
his
hand
and
stared
into
my
eyes
there
were
other
things
that
puzzled
me
there
was
for
instance
the
chief
doctor
in
our
town
he
was
a
large
fat
jolly
man
with
white
hair
he
was
considered
the
best
doctor
in
the
place
all
the
old
maids
went
to
him
he
was
immensely
jolly
you
could
hear
his
laugh
from
one
end
of
the
street
to
the
other
he
was
married
had
a
delightful
little
house
where
his
wife
gave
charming
dinners
he
was
stupid
and
even
at
his
own
work
he
was
stupid
reading
nothing
careless
and
forgetful
thinking
about
golf
and
food
only
all
his
days
he
was
a
snob
too
and
would
give
up
any
one
for
the
people
at
the
castle
even
when
i
was
a
small
boy
i
somehow
knew
all
this
about
him
my
father
thought
the
world
of
him
and
loved
to
play
golf
with
him
he
was
completely
happy
and
successful
and
popular
then
there
was
another
man
an
old
canon
who
taught
me
latin
before
i
went
to
rugby
an
old
untidy
dirty
man
whose
sermons
were
dull
and
his
manners
bad
he
was
a
failure
in
life
and
he
was
a
failure
to
himself
dissatisfied
with
what
he
used
to
call
his
of
rotten
twigs
his
life
and
habits
and
thoughts
but
he
thought
that
somewhere
there
was
something
he
would
find
that
would
save
him
somewhere
sometime
not
god
merely
a
key
that
will
open
all
the
doors
in
the
house
to
me
he
was
fascinating
he
knew
so
much
he
was
so
humble
so
kind
so
amusing
nobody
liked
him
of
course
they
tried
to
turn
him
out
of
the
place
gave
him
a
little
living
at
last
and
he
married
his
cook
was
she
his
key
she
may
have
been
i
never
saw
him
again
but
i
used
to
wonder
why
was
the
doctor
so
happy
and
the
little
canon
so
unhappy
the
doctor
so
successful
the
canon
so
unsuccessful
i
decided
that
the
great
thing
was
to
be
satisfied
with
oneself
i
determined
that
i
would
be
satisfied
with
myself
well
of
course
i
never
was
never
have
been
something
would
let
me
alone
the
key
to
the
door
perhaps
everything
was
shut
up
inside
me
and
at
last
i
began
to
wonder
whether
there
was
anything
there
at
all
when
at
nineteen
i
went
to
cambridge
i
was
very
unhappy
whilst
i
was
there
my
mother
died
i
came
back
to
the
little
house
and
lived
with
my
father
i
was
quite
alone
in
the
world
in
spite
of
myself
i
had
a
little
movement
of
impatience
how
the
man
is
as
though
his
case
were
at
all
peculiar
wants
shaking
up
and
knocking
about
he
seemed
to
know
my
thought
you
must
think
me
i
was
for
thirteen
whole
years
i
thought
of
nothing
but
myself
my
miserable
self
all
shut
up
in
that
little
town
i
talked
to
no
one
i
did
not
even
read
i
used
to
sit
in
the
dark
of
the
cathedral
nave
and
listen
to
the
organ
i
walk
in
the
orchards
and
the
woods
i
would
wonder
wonder
wonder
about
people
and
i
grew
more
and
more
frightened
of
talking
of
meeting
people
of
little
local
it
was
as
though
i
were
on
one
side
of
the
river
and
they
were
all
on
the
other
i
would
think
sometimes
how
splendid
it
would
be
if
i
could
cross
but
i
cross
every
year
it
became
more
impossible
you
wanted
some
one
to
take
you
out
of
yourself
i
said
and
then
shuddered
at
my
own
banality
but
he
took
me
very
seriously
i
did
of
course
he
answered
but
who
would
bother
they
all
thought
me
impossible
the
girls
all
laughed
at
me
my
own
cousins
sometimes
people
tried
to
help
me
they
never
went
far
enough
they
gave
me
up
too
soon
he
evidently
thinks
he
was
worth
a
lot
of
trouble
i
thought
irritably
but
suddenly
he
laughed
that
same
doctor
one
day
spoke
of
me
not
knowing
that
i
was
near
him
or
perhaps
he
knew
and
thought
it
would
be
good
for
me
trenchard
he
said
ought
to
be
in
a
nunnery
and
he
be
quite
safe
too
never
cause
a
scandal
they
thought
of
me
as
something
not
quite
human
my
father
was
very
old
now
just
before
he
died
he
said
like
to
have
had
a
son
he
never
noticed
me
at
his
bedside
when
he
died
i
was
a
great
disappointment
to
him
well
i
said
at
last
to
break
a
long
pause
that
followed
his
last
words
what
did
you
think
about
all
that
time
you
were
alone
i
used
to
think
always
about
two
things
he
said
very
solemnly
one
was
love
i
used
to
think
how
splendid
it
would
be
if
only
there
would
be
some
one
to
whom
i
could
dedicate
my
devotion
i
did
care
if
i
got
much
in
return
or
no
but
they
must
be
willing
to
have
it
ready
for
me
to
devote
myself
altogether
i
used
to
watch
the
ladies
in
our
town
and
select
them
one
after
another
of
course
they
never
knew
and
they
would
only
have
laughed
had
they
known
but
i
felt
quite
desperate
sometimes
i
had
so
much
in
me
to
give
to
some
one
and
the
years
were
all
slipping
by
and
it
became
every
day
more
difficult
there
a
girl
something
seemed
to
begin
between
us
she
was
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
canons
and
she
used
to
wear
a
dress
she
was
very
kind
once
when
we
were
walking
through
the
town
i
began
to
talk
to
her
i
believe
she
understood
because
she
was
very
very
young
only
about
eighteen
and
begun
to
laugh
at
me
yet
she
had
a
dimple
in
one
cheek
very
charming
but
some
man
from
london
came
to
stay
at
the
castle
and
she
was
engaged
to
him
then
there
were
katherine
and
millie
trenchard
of
whom
we
were
talking
katherine
never
laughed
at
me
she
was
serious
and
helped
her
mother
about
all
the
household
things
and
the
village
where
they
lived
afterwards
she
ran
away
with
a
young
man
and
was
married
in
london
very
strange
because
she
was
so
serious
there
was
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
it
at
the
time
millie
too
was
charming
she
laughed
at
me
of
course
but
she
laughed
at
every
one
at
any
rate
she
was
only
cousinly
to
me
she
would
not
have
cared
for
my
devotion
as
he
spoke
i
had
a
picture
in
my
mind
of
poor
trenchard
searching
the
countryside
for
some
one
to
whom
he
might
be
devoted
clumsy
stumbling
and
stuttering
a
village
don
quixote
with
a
stammer
and
without
a
dulcinea
they
must
have
been
difficult
years
i
said
and
again
cursed
myself
for
my
banality
they
were
he
answered
very
gravely
very
difficult
and
your
other
thoughts
i
asked
him
they
were
about
death
he
replied
i
had
from
my
very
earliest
years
a
great
terror
of
death
you
might
think
that
my
life
was
not
so
pleasant
that
i
should
mind
very
greatly
leaving
it
but
i
was
always
thinking
hoping
that
i
should
live
to
be
very
old
even
though
i
lost
all
my
limbs
and
faculties
i
believed
that
there
was
life
of
some
sort
after
death
but
just
as
i
would
hesitate
outside
a
house
a
quarter
of
an
hour
from
terror
of
meeting
new
faces
so
i
felt
about
another
life
i
could
bear
all
the
introductions
and
the
clumsy
mistakes
that
i
should
be
sure
to
make
but
it
was
more
personal
than
that
i
had
a
horrible
old
uncle
who
died
when
i
was
a
boy
he
was
a
very
ugly
old
man
bent
and
whitened
and
gnarled
a
face
and
hands
twisted
with
rheumatism
i
used
to
call
him
quilp
to
myself
he
always
wore
i
remember
an
dress
velvet
a
white
stock
black
shoes
with
buckles
i
remember
that
his
hands
were
damp
and
hair
grew
in
bushes
out
of
his
ears
well
i
saw
him
once
or
twice
and
he
filled
me
with
terror
like
a
figure
out
of
the
tapestry
up
at
the
castle
then
he
died
our
house
was
small
and
badly
shaped
full
of
dark
corners
and
after
his
death
he
seemed
to
me
to
haunt
the
place
he
figured
death
to
me
and
until
i
was
quite
old
until
i
went
to
rugby
i
fancied
that
he
was
sitting
in
a
dark
corner
on
a
chair
waiting
with
his
hands
on
his
lap
until
the
time
came
for
him
to
take
me
sometimes
i
would
fancy
that
i
heard
him
moving
from
one
room
to
another
bringing
his
chair
with
him
then
i
began
to
have
a
dream
a
dream
that
frequently
recurred
all
the
time
that
i
was
growing
up
it
was
a
dream
about
a
huge
dark
house
in
a
huge
dark
forest
it
was
early
morning
the
light
just
glimmering
between
the
thick
damp
trees
a
large
party
of
people
gathered
together
in
a
high
empty
room
prepared
for
an
expedition
i
was
one
of
them
and
i
was
filled
with
sharp
agonising
terror
sometimes
in
my
dream
i
drank
to
give
myself
courage
and
the
glass
clattered
against
my
lips
sometimes
i
talked
with
one
of
the
company
the
room
was
very
dark
and
i
could
see
no
faces
then
we
would
start
trooping
out
into
the
bitterly
cold
morning
air
there
would
be
many
horses
and
dogs
we
would
lead
off
into
the
forest
and
soon
it
always
happened
i
would
find
myself
alone
alone
with
the
dripping
trees
high
around
me
and
the
light
that
seemed
to
grow
no
lighter
and
the
intense
cold
then
suddenly
it
would
be
that
i
was
the
hunted
not
the
hunter
it
was
death
whom
we
were
hunting
death
for
me
my
uncle
and
i
would
fancy
him
waiting
in
the
darkness
watching
me
smiling
hearing
his
hunters
draw
off
the
scent
knowing
that
they
would
not
find
him
but
that
had
found
then
my
knees
would
fail
me
i
would
sink
down
in
a
sweat
of
terror
and
wake
brrr
i
can
see
it
now
he
shook
himself
turning
round
to
me
as
though
he
were
suddenly
ashamed
of
himself
with
a
laugh
we
all
have
our
dreams
he
continued
but
this
came
too
often
again
and
again
the
question
of
death
became
my
constant
preoccupation
as
i
grew
to
think
i
would
never
see
it
nor
hear
men
speak
of
it
nor
and
you
have
come
i
could
not
but
interrupt
him
here
to
the
very
fortress
why
man
i
know
he
answered
smiling
at
me
it
must
seem
to
you
ridiculous
but
i
am
a
different
person
now
very
different
now
i
am
ready
eager
for
anything
death
can
be
nothing
to
me
now
or
if
that
is
too
bold
at
least
i
may
say
that
i
am
prepared
to
meet
him
anywhere
at
any
time
i
want
to
meet
him
i
want
to
show
we
have
all
i
said
in
our
hearts
perhaps
come
like
that
come
to
prove
that
our
secret
picture
of
ourselves
that
picture
so
different
from
our
friends
opinion
of
us
is
really
the
true
one
we
can
fancy
them
saying
afterwards
i
never
knew
that
had
so
much
in
him
always
knew
no
you
see
trenchard
said
eagerly
there
can
be
only
one
person
now
about
whose
opinion
i
care
if
thinks
well
of
me
you
are
very
much
in
love
i
said
and
loosed
as
i
had
expected
the
torrents
of
his
happiness
upon
me
i
was
in
polchester
when
the
war
broke
out
the
town
received
it
rather
as
though
a
company
had
come
from
london
to
act
in
the
assembly
rooms
for
a
fortnight
it
was
dramatic
and
picturesque
and
pleasantly
patriotic
they
see
it
otherwise
now
i
fancy
i
seemed
at
once
to
think
of
russia
for
one
thing
i
wanted
desperately
to
help
and
i
thought
that
in
england
they
would
only
laugh
at
me
as
they
had
always
done
i
am
i
knew
that
i
should
never
be
a
soldier
i
fancied
that
in
russia
they
would
not
say
john
trenchard
of
polchester
no
good
before
they
seen
whether
i
could
do
anything
then
of
course
i
had
read
about
the
country
tolstoi
and
turgeniev
and
a
little
dostoevsky
and
even
gorki
and
tchekov
i
went
quite
suddenly
making
up
my
mind
one
evening
i
seemed
to
begin
to
be
a
new
man
out
of
england
the
journey
delighted
me
i
was
in
moscow
before
i
knew
i
was
there
three
months
trying
to
learn
russian
then
i
came
to
petrograd
and
through
the
english
embassy
found
a
place
in
one
of
the
hospitals
where
i
worked
as
a
sanitar
for
three
months
i
did
not
leave
england
until
november
so
that
i
have
been
in
russia
now
just
six
months
it
was
in
this
hospital
that
i
met
miss
krassovsky
marie
ivanovna
from
the
first
moment
i
loved
her
of
course
and
she
liked
me
she
was
the
first
woman
since
my
mother
who
had
really
liked
me
she
quickly
saw
my
devotion
and
she
laughed
a
little
but
she
was
always
kind
i
could
talk
to
her
and
she
liked
to
listen
she
had
she
has
great
ideals
great
hopes
and
ambitions
we
worked
together
there
and
then
afterwards
in
those
beautiful
spring
evenings
in
petrograd
when
the
canals
shone
all
night
and
the
houses
were
purple
we
walked
the
night
before
last
night
i
begged
her
to
marry
me
and
she
accepted
she
said
that
we
would
go
together
to
the
war
that
i
should
be
her
knight
and
she
my
lady
and
that
we
would
care
for
the
wounds
of
the
whole
world
ah
what
a
night
that
was
shall
i
ever
forget
it
after
she
had
left
me
i
walked
all
night
and
sang
i
was
mad
i
am
mad
now
that
she
should
love
she
so
beautiful
so
pure
so
wonderful
i
at
whom
women
have
always
laughed
ah
god
forgive
me
my
heart
will
break
as
he
spoke
the
heavy
grey
clouds
of
the
first
dawn
were
parting
and
a
faint
very
liquid
blue
almost
white
and
very
cold
hovered
above
dim
shapeless
trees
and
fields
i
flung
open
the
corridor
window
and
a
sound
of
running
water
and
the
first
notes
of
some
sleepy
bird
met
me
and
her
family
i
said
who
are
they
and
will
they
not
mind
her
marrying
an
englishman
she
has
only
a
mother
he
answered
i
fancy
that
marie
has
always
had
her
own
way
yes
i
thought
to
myself
i
also
fancy
that
that
is
so
a
sense
of
almost
fatherly
protection
had
developed
in
myself
towards
him
how
could
he
who
knew
nothing
at
all
of
women
hope
to
manage
that
eager
independent
girl
why
why
why
had
she
engaged
herself
to
him
i
fancied
that
very
possibly
there
were
qualities
in
him
his
very
childishness
and
helplessness
which
if
they
only
irritated
an
englishman
would
attract
a
russian
lame
dogs
find
a
warm
home
in
russia
but
did
she
know
anything
about
him
would
she
not
in
a
week
be
irritated
by
his
incapacity
and
he
he
bless
his
innocence
was
so
confident
as
though
he
had
been
married
to
her
for
years
look
here
i
said
moved
by
a
sudden
impulse
will
you
mind
if
sometimes
i
tell
you
things
i
been
to
the
war
before
it
a
strange
life
unlike
anything
you
ever
known
and
russians
too
are
strange
especially
at
first
you
wo
take
it
badly
if
he
touched
my
arm
with
his
hand
while
his
whole
face
was
lighted
with
his
smile
why
my
dear
fellow
i
shall
be
proud
no
one
has
ever
thought
me
worth
the
bother
i
want
to
be
to
be
at
my
best
here
practical
you
know
like
others
i
do
want
her
to
think
me
no
exactly
i
said
hurriedly
i
understand
gold
was
creeping
into
the
sky
a
lark
rose
triumphant
a
pool
amongst
the
reeds
blazed
like
a
brazen
shield
the
spring
day
had
flung
back
her
doors
i
saw
that
suddenly
fatigue
had
leapt
upon
my
friend
he
tottered
on
his
little
seat
then
his
face
grey
in
the
light
fell
forward
i
caught
him
in
my
arms
half
carried
half
led
him
into
our
little
carriage
arranged
him
in
the
empty
corner
and
left
him
fast
utterly
fast
asleep
chapter
ii
the
the
greater
part
of
the
next
day
was
spent
by
us
in
the
little
town
of
s
a
comfortable
place
very
slightly
disturbed
by
the
fact
that
it
had
been
already
the
scene
of
four
battles
there
was
just
this
effect
as
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
affairs
of
the
day
were
carried
on
with
a
kind
of
somnolent
indifference
you
may
order
your
veal
the
waiter
seemed
to
say
but
whether
you
will
get
it
or
no
is
entirely
in
the
hands
of
god
it
is
therefore
of
no
avail
that
i
should
hurry
or
that
you
should
show
temper
should
the
veal
not
appear
at
any
moment
your
desire
for
veal
and
my
ability
to
bring
it
you
may
have
ceased
for
ever
for
the
rest
the
town
billowed
with
trees
of
the
youngest
green
also
birds
of
the
tenderest
age
if
one
may
judge
by
their
happiness
at
the
spring
weather
there
were
many
old
men
in
white
smocks
and
white
trousers
and
women
in
kerchiefs
but
except
for
the
young
birds
it
was
a
silent
place
i
had
much
business
to
carry
through
and
saw
the
rest
of
our
company
only
at
luncheon
time
it
was
after
luncheon
that
i
had
a
little
conversation
with
marie
ivanovna
she
chose
me
quite
deliberately
from
the
others
moved
our
chairs
to
the
quieter
end
of
the
little
balcony
where
we
were
planted
her
elbows
on
the
table
and
stared
into
my
face
with
her
large
round
credulous
eyes
i
find
on
looking
back
that
i
have
already
used
exactly
those
adjectives
that
may
stand
i
mean
that
emphatically
and
beyond
every
other
impression
she
made
her
gaze
declared
that
she
was
ready
to
believe
anything
that
she
were
told
and
the
more
in
the
telling
the
better
she
spoke
as
always
with
that
sense
of
restrained
sharply
disciplined
excitement
as
though
her
eager
vitality
were
some
splendid
if
ferocious
animal
struggling
at
its
chain
you
talked
to
john
trenchard
last
night
she
said
yes
i
said
smiling
into
her
eyes
i
know
all
night
he
told
me
he
splendid
is
he
splendid
i
like
him
very
much
i
answered
ah
you
must
you
must
you
must
all
like
him
you
do
know
his
thoughts
his
ideals
they
are
wonderful
he
like
some
knight
of
the
middle
ages
ah
but
you
think
that
silly
durward
you
a
practical
englishman
i
hate
practical
englishmen
thank
you
i
said
laughing
no
but
i
do
you
sneer
at
everything
beautiful
here
in
russia
more
simple
and
john
very
like
a
russian
in
many
ways
do
you
think
he
is
i
have
known
him
long
enough
i
began
ah
you
do
like
him
i
see
you
do
no
it
no
use
your
saying
anything
he
is
english
enough
for
you
that
what
it
is
you
think
him
unpractical
unworldly
well
so
he
is
do
you
think
ever
be
engaged
to
an
ordinary
englishman
i
die
of
ennui
in
a
week
oh
yes
i
would
but
you
like
john
really
do
you
i
tell
you
that
i
do
i
answered
but
really
after
only
two
days
ah
that
so
english
so
cautious
how
i
hate
your
caution
why
ca
you
say
at
once
that
you
have
made
up
your
mind
about
him
because
that
the
truth
is
it
i
wish
he
would
not
sit
there
looking
at
me
and
not
talking
to
the
others
he
ought
to
talk
to
them
but
he
afraid
that
they
laugh
at
his
russian
it
not
very
good
his
russian
is
it
i
ca
help
laughing
myself
sometimes
english
was
extremely
good
sometimes
she
used
a
word
in
its
wrong
sense
she
had
one
or
two
charming
little
phrases
of
her
own
what
a
purpose
to
instead
of
why
and
sometimes
a
double
negative
she
rolled
her
r
more
than
is
our
habit
i
said
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
it
a
tremendous
thing
to
him
his
having
you
i
can
see
that
although
i
known
him
so
short
a
time
he
a
very
lucky
man
and
and
if
his
luck
were
to
go
i
think
that
he
simply
die
there
that
is
a
very
english
thing
to
have
said
is
it
why
did
you
say
it
she
cried
sharply
you
do
trust
me
you
think
i
think
nothing
i
answered
only
he
not
like
ordinary
men
so
much
younger
than
his
age
she
gave
me
then
the
strangest
look
the
light
seemed
suddenly
to
die
out
of
her
face
her
eyes
sought
mine
as
though
for
help
there
were
tears
in
them
oh
i
do
want
to
be
good
to
him
she
whispered
then
got
up
abruptly
and
joined
the
others
late
in
the
afternoon
an
automobile
arrived
and
carried
off
most
of
our
party
i
was
compelled
to
remain
for
several
hours
and
intended
to
drive
looking
forward
indeed
to
the
long
quiet
silence
of
the
spring
evening
moved
by
some
sudden
impulse
i
suggested
to
trenchard
that
he
should
wait
and
drive
with
me
the
car
will
be
very
crowded
i
said
and
i
think
too
that
you
like
to
see
some
of
the
country
properly
it
a
lovely
evening
only
thirty
versts
will
you
wait
and
come
with
me
he
agreed
at
once
he
had
been
all
day
very
quiet
watching
with
that
rather
clumsy
expression
of
his
the
expression
of
a
dog
who
had
been
taught
by
his
master
some
tricks
which
he
had
and
would
presently
be
expected
to
remember
when
i
made
my
suggestion
he
flung
one
look
at
marie
ivanovna
she
was
busied
over
some
piece
of
luggage
and
her
head
smiling
at
him
ah
do
go
john
yes
we
will
be
so
it
will
be
very
nice
for
you
driving
i
fancied
that
i
heard
him
sigh
he
tried
to
help
the
ladies
with
their
luggage
handed
them
the
wrong
parcels
dropped
delicate
packages
apologised
blushed
was
very
hot
collected
dust
from
i
know
not
where
once
i
heard
a
sharp
angry
voice
john
oh
i
could
not
believe
that
it
was
marie
ivanovna
of
course
she
was
hot
and
tired
and
had
slept
last
night
but
little
the
car
watched
by
an
inquisitive
but
strangely
apathetic
crowd
of
peasants
snorted
its
way
down
the
little
streets
the
green
trees
blowing
and
the
starlings
chattering
in
a
moment
the
starlings
and
our
two
selves
seemed
to
have
the
whole
dead
little
town
to
ourselves
i
saw
quite
clearly
that
he
was
unhappy
he
could
never
disguise
his
feelings
as
he
waited
for
the
trap
to
appear
he
had
the
same
lost
and
abandoned
appearance
that
he
had
on
my
first
vision
of
him
at
the
petrograd
station
the
soldier
who
was
to
drive
us
smiled
as
he
saw
me
only
thirty
versts
your
honour
or
thank
god
even
less
it
will
take
us
no
time
he
was
a
large
clumsy
creature
like
an
eager
overgrown
puppy
he
was
one
of
the
four
or
five
nikolais
in
our
otriad
and
he
is
to
be
noticed
in
this
history
because
he
attached
himself
from
the
very
beginning
to
trenchard
with
that
faithful
and
utterly
unquestioning
devotion
of
which
the
russian
soldier
is
so
frequently
capable
he
must
i
think
have
seen
something
helpless
and
unhappy
in
trenchard
appearance
on
this
evening
sancho
to
our
don
quixote
he
was
from
that
first
moment
yes
he
an
english
gentleman
i
said
when
he
had
listened
for
a
moment
to
trenchard
russian
like
yourself
said
nikolai
yes
nikolai
you
must
look
after
him
he
be
strange
here
at
first
i
hear
that
was
all
he
said
he
got
up
on
to
his
seat
his
broad
back
was
bent
over
his
horses
well
and
how
have
things
been
nikolai
busy
not
at
all
very
quiet
no
wounded
nothing
at
all
for
two
weeks
now
have
you
liked
that
certainly
yes
no
but
have
you
totchno
then
he
turned
and
gave
for
one
swift
instant
a
glance
at
trenchard
who
was
very
clumsily
climbing
into
the
carriage
nikolai
looked
at
him
gravely
his
round
red
face
was
quite
expressionless
as
he
turned
back
and
began
to
abjure
his
horses
in
that
and
wholly
human
whispering
exclamation
that
russians
use
to
their
animals
we
started
i
have
mentioned
in
these
pages
that
i
had
already
spent
three
months
with
our
otriad
at
the
front
i
can
not
now
define
exactly
what
it
was
that
made
this
drive
on
this
first
evening
something
utterly
distinct
and
apart
from
all
that
i
had
experienced
during
that
earlier
period
it
is
true
that
before
i
had
been
for
almost
two
months
in
one
place
and
had
seen
nothing
at
all
of
actual
warfare
except
the
feeding
and
bandaging
of
the
wounded
but
i
had
imagined
then
nevertheless
that
i
was
truly
in
the
thick
of
things
as
indeed
in
comparison
with
my
moscow
or
petrograd
life
i
was
we
had
not
now
driven
through
the
quiet
evening
air
for
ten
minutes
before
i
knew
with
assured
certainty
that
a
new
phase
of
life
was
on
this
day
opening
before
me
the
dark
hedges
the
thin
fine
dust
on
the
roads
the
deep
purple
colour
of
the
air
beat
at
my
heart
as
though
they
themselves
were
helping
with
quiet
insistency
to
draw
me
into
the
drama
and
yet
nothing
could
have
been
more
peaceful
than
was
that
lovely
evening
the
dark
in
the
evening
sky
soaked
like
wine
into
the
hills
the
fields
the
thatched
cottages
the
streams
and
the
little
woods
the
faint
saffron
that
lingered
below
the
crests
and
peaks
of
rosy
cloud
showed
between
the
stems
of
the
silver
birches
like
the
friendly
smile
of
a
happy
day
the
only
human
beings
to
be
seen
were
the
peasants
driving
home
their
cows
far
on
the
horizon
the
carpathian
mountains
were
purple
in
the
dusk
the
snow
on
their
highest
ridges
faintly
silver
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
world
except
the
ring
of
our
horses
hoofs
upon
the
road
and
yet
this
sinister
excitement
hammered
from
somewhere
at
me
as
i
had
never
felt
it
before
it
was
as
though
the
lovely
evening
were
a
painted
scene
lowered
to
hide
some
atrocity
this
is
scarcely
what
you
expected
a
conquered
country
to
look
like
is
it
i
said
to
trenchard
he
looked
about
him
then
said
hesitating
no
that
is
i
do
know
what
i
expected
a
curved
moon
dull
gold
like
buried
treasure
rose
slowly
above
the
hill
one
white
star
flickered
and
the
scents
of
the
little
gardens
that
lined
the
road
grew
thicker
in
the
air
as
the
day
faded
i
was
conscious
of
some
restraint
with
trenchard
he
probably
wishing
i
thought
that
he
not
been
so
expansive
last
night
he
does
trust
me
once
he
said
abruptly
they
give
me
wo
they
work
to
do
it
would
be
terrible
if
there
was
work
i
not
so
so
stupid
at
bandaging
i
learnt
a
lot
in
the
hospital
and
although
i
clumsy
with
my
hands
generally
i
not
so
clumsy
about
that
why
of
course
i
answered
when
there
work
they
be
only
too
delighted
but
there
wo
always
be
work
you
must
be
prepared
for
that
sometimes
our
division
is
in
reserve
and
then
we
in
reserve
too
sometimes
for
so
much
as
a
fortnight
when
i
was
out
here
before
i
was
in
one
place
for
more
than
two
months
you
must
just
take
everything
as
it
comes
i
want
to
work
he
said
i
once
again
only
he
spoke
that
little
fat
man
who
travelled
with
us
andrey
vassilievitch
i
said
yes
he
interests
me
you
knew
him
before
yes
i
known
him
slightly
for
some
years
what
has
he
come
for
he
frightened
out
of
his
life
frightened
yes
he
himself
told
me
he
says
that
he
very
nervous
but
that
he
must
do
everything
that
every
one
else
does
for
a
certain
reason
he
got
very
excited
when
he
talked
to
me
and
asked
me
whether
i
thought
it
would
all
be
very
terrible
he
is
a
nervous
fussy
little
man
russians
are
not
cowards
but
andrey
vassilievitch
lost
his
wife
last
year
he
was
very
devoted
to
her
very
he
is
miserable
without
her
they
say
perhaps
he
has
come
to
the
war
to
forget
her
i
was
surprised
at
trenchard
interest
i
had
thought
him
so
wrapt
in
his
own
especial
affair
that
nothing
outside
it
could
occupy
him
but
he
continued
he
knew
the
tall
doctor
nikitin
before
did
he
yes
nikitin
knew
his
wife
oh
i
see
nikitin
seems
to
despise
him
i
think
he
despises
all
of
us
oh
no
that
only
his
manner
many
russians
look
as
though
they
were
despising
their
neighbours
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
really
despising
themselves
they
very
fond
of
despising
themselves
their
contempt
allows
them
to
do
what
they
want
to
i
do
think
nikitin
despises
himself
he
looks
too
happy
at
least
happy
is
not
the
word
perhaps
triumphant
is
what
i
mean
ah
if
you
begin
speculating
about
russian
expression
you
lost
they
express
so
much
in
their
faces
that
you
think
you
know
all
their
deepest
feelings
but
they
not
their
deep
feelings
that
you
see
only
their
quick
transient
emotions
that
change
every
moment
i
fancied
just
at
that
time
that
i
had
studied
the
russian
character
very
intently
and
it
was
perhaps
agreeable
to
me
to
air
my
knowledge
before
an
englishman
who
had
come
to
russia
for
the
first
time
so
recently
but
trenchard
did
not
seem
to
be
greatly
impressed
by
my
cleverness
he
spoke
no
more
we
drove
then
in
silence
whilst
the
moon
rising
high
caught
colour
into
its
dim
outline
like
a
scimitar
unsheathed
the
trees
and
hedges
grew
with
every
moment
darker
we
left
the
valley
through
which
we
had
been
driving
slowly
climbing
the
hill
and
here
on
the
top
of
the
rising
ground
we
had
our
first
glimpse
of
the
outposts
of
the
war
a
cottage
had
been
posted
on
the
highest
point
of
the
hill
now
all
that
remained
of
it
was
a
sheet
of
iron
crumpled
like
paper
propped
in
the
centre
by
a
black
and
solitary
post
trailing
thence
on
the
ground
amongst
tumbled
bricks
and
refuse
this
sheet
of
iron
was
silver
in
the
moonlight
and
stood
out
with
its
solitary
black
support
against
the
night
sky
which
was
now
breaking
into
a
million
stars
behind
it
stretched
a
flat
plain
that
reached
to
the
horizon
there
i
said
to
trenchard
there
your
first
glimpse
of
actual
warfare
what
do
you
say
to
every
house
in
your
village
at
home
like
that
it
ghastly
enough
if
you
see
it
as
i
have
done
still
smoking
with
the
and
and
pictures
lying
about
but
trenchard
said
nothing
we
started
across
the
plain
and
at
once
as
with
childe
roland
mark
no
sooner
was
i
fairly
found
pledged
to
the
plain
after
a
pace
or
two
than
pausing
to
throw
backward
a
last
view
the
safe
road
was
gone
grey
plain
all
round
nothing
but
plain
to
the
horizon
bound
i
might
go
on
nought
else
remained
to
our
safe
road
was
a
rough
and
stony
track
far
in
front
of
us
on
the
rising
hill
that
bounded
the
horizon
a
red
light
watched
us
like
an
angry
eye
there
were
cornfields
that
stirred
and
whispered
but
no
hedges
no
trees
and
not
a
house
to
be
seen
nikolai
turned
and
said
a
very
strong
battle
here
your
honour
only
three
weeks
back
by
the
side
of
the
road
stood
a
little
cluster
of
wooden
crosses
and
behind
them
were
two
large
holes
filled
now
with
water
upon
which
the
moon
was
shining
in
these
holes
the
frogs
were
making
a
tremendous
noise
that
was
shell
i
said
to
trenchard
pointing
the
frogs
drowned
my
voice
there
was
something
of
a
melancholy
triumph
in
their
cry
and
their
voices
seemed
to
be
caught
up
and
echoed
by
thousands
upon
thousands
of
other
frogs
inhabiting
the
plain
we
came
then
upon
a
trench
the
ridge
of
it
stretched
like
a
black
cord
straight
across
the
cornfield
and
here
for
a
moment
the
road
seemed
lost
i
got
out
here
trenchard
you
must
come
and
look
at
this
your
first
austrian
trench
you
may
find
treasure
we
walked
along
in
single
file
for
some
time
and
then
suddenly
i
lost
him
the
trench
just
where
we
were
divided
into
two
i
waited
thinking
that
in
a
moment
he
would
appear
there
was
nothing
very
thrilling
about
my
trench
it
was
an
old
one
and
all
that
remained
now
of
any
life
was
the
blackened
ground
where
there
had
been
cooking
the
brown
soiled
and
many
empty
tin
cans
and
then
as
i
waited
leaning
forward
with
my
elbows
on
the
earthwork
the
frogs
the
only
sound
in
the
world
i
was
conscious
that
some
one
was
watching
me
in
front
of
me
i
could
see
the
red
light
flickering
and
turning
a
little
as
it
seemed
behind
me
nothing
but
the
starlight
i
turned
looked
back
and
for
my
very
life
could
not
hold
myself
from
calling
out
who
there
i
waited
then
called
more
loudly
trenchard
trenchard
i
laughed
at
myself
leant
again
on
the
trench
and
puffed
at
my
cigarette
then
once
more
i
was
absolutely
assured
that
some
one
watched
me
i
called
again
who
there
then
quite
suddenly
and
to
my
own
absurd
relief
trenchard
appeared
stumbling
forward
over
some
roughness
in
the
ground
almost
into
my
arms
i
say
it
beastly
here
he
cried
let
go
on
the
frogs
he
had
caught
my
hand
well
i
said
what
did
you
find
nothing
only
i
do
know
it
as
though
some
one
were
watching
me
it
getting
late
is
it
the
frogs
he
said
again
i
hate
them
they
seem
to
be
triumphing
we
climbed
into
the
trap
and
drove
on
in
silence
i
was
half
asleep
when
at
last
we
left
the
plain
and
dropped
down
into
the
valley
beyond
i
was
surprised
to
discover
on
looking
at
my
watch
that
it
was
only
eleven
we
had
been
it
seemed
to
me
hours
crossing
that
plain
it
a
silly
thing
i
said
to
trenchard
but
it
would
take
quite
a
lot
to
get
me
to
drive
back
over
that
again
he
nodded
his
head
we
drove
over
a
bridge
up
a
little
hill
and
were
in
the
rough
moonlit
square
of
o
our
destination
almost
immediately
we
were
climbing
the
dark
rickety
stairs
of
our
dwelling
there
were
lights
shouts
of
welcome
molozov
our
chief
sisters
doctors
students
the
room
almost
filled
with
a
table
covered
with
food
cold
meat
boiled
eggs
sausage
jam
sweets
and
of
course
a
huge
samovar
i
can
only
say
that
never
once
during
my
earlier
experience
with
the
otriad
had
i
been
so
rejoiced
to
see
lights
and
friendly
faces
i
looked
round
for
trenchard
he
had
already
discovered
marie
ivanovna
and
was
standing
with
her
at
the
window
i
learned
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
that
we
were
at
once
to
move
to
a
house
outside
the
village
the
fantastic
illusions
that
my
drive
of
the
evening
before
had
bred
in
me
now
in
the
clear
light
of
morning
entirely
deserted
me
moreover
fantasy
had
slender
opportunity
of
encouragement
in
the
presence
of
molozov
molozov
i
would
wish
to
say
once
and
for
all
was
the
heart
and
soul
of
our
enterprise
without
him
the
whole
organisation
so
admirably
supported
by
the
energetic
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
petrograd
would
have
tumbled
instantly
into
a
thousand
pieces
in
molozov
they
had
discovered
exactly
the
man
for
their
purpose
a
large
a
member
of
one
of
the
best
russian
families
he
had
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
given
himself
up
to
the
adventure
with
the
whole
of
his
energy
with
the
whole
of
that
great
capacity
for
organisation
that
the
management
of
his
estates
had
already
taught
him
he
was
in
appearance
short
squarely
built
inclined
although
he
was
only
or
three
to
be
stout
he
wore
a
dark
black
moustache
and
his
hair
was
already
grey
he
was
a
russian
of
the
purest
blood
and
yet
possessed
all
the
qualities
that
the
absolute
russian
is
supposed
to
lack
he
was
punctual
to
the
moment
sharply
accurate
in
all
his
affairs
a
shrewd
psychologist
but
never
a
great
talker
and
above
all
a
consummate
diplomatist
as
i
watched
him
dealing
with
the
widely
opposed
temperaments
and
dispositions
of
all
our
company
soothing
one
scolding
another
listening
attentively
cutting
complaints
short
comforting
commanding
soliciting
i
marvelled
at
the
good
fortune
of
that
petrograd
committee
in
spite
of
his
kind
heart
and
he
was
one
of
the
men
i
have
ever
met
he
could
be
quite
ruthless
in
dismissal
or
rebuke
when
occasion
arrived
he
had
a
great
gift
of
the
russian
irony
and
he
could
be
also
like
all
russians
a
child
at
an
instant
call
if
something
pleased
him
or
if
he
simply
felt
that
the
times
were
good
and
the
sun
was
shining
i
only
once
in
a
moment
that
i
shall
have
later
on
to
describe
saw
him
depressed
and
out
of
heart
he
was
always
a
most
courteous
gentleman
i
drove
now
with
him
in
a
trap
at
the
head
of
the
as
our
long
train
with
our
tents
provisions
boxes
and
beds
was
called
we
were
a
fine
company
now
and
my
heart
was
proud
as
i
looked
back
up
the
shining
road
and
saw
the
long
winding
procession
of
carts
and
sanitars
and
remembered
how
tiny
an
affair
we
had
been
in
the
beginning
well
said
molozov
and
what
of
your
englishman
oh
i
like
him
i
said
rather
hurriedly
he
do
i
glad
you
think
so
very
glad
i
was
not
sure
last
night
he
does
speak
russian
very
well
does
he
he
was
tired
last
night
very
glad
that
he
should
come
of
course
but
it
unpleasant
this
engagement
the
sister
told
me
it
a
little
difficult
for
all
of
us
they
were
engaged
the
evening
before
they
left
i
know
nothing
to
do
about
it
but
it
would
have
been
better
otherwise
and
andrey
vassilievitch
whatever
put
it
into
anna
mihailovna
head
to
send
him
he
a
tiresome
little
man
i
known
him
earlier
in
petrograd
he
on
my
nerves
already
with
his
chatter
no
it
too
bad
what
can
he
do
with
us
he
has
a
very
good
business
head
i
said
and
he
not
really
a
bad
little
man
and
he
very
anxious
to
do
everything
ah
i
know
those
people
who
are
to
do
i
know
do
you
remember
sister
anna
maria
anxious
to
do
everything
anything
and
then
when
it
came
to
it
not
even
the
simplest
bandage
nikitin
a
good
man
he
added
one
of
the
best
doctors
in
petrograd
we
no
doctors
of
our
own
now
you
know
except
of
course
alexei
petrovitch
the
others
are
all
from
the
division
ah
semyonov
i
said
how
is
he
at
that
moment
he
rode
up
to
us
seen
on
horseback
alexei
petrovitch
semyonov
appeared
a
large
man
he
was
in
reality
of
middle
height
but
his
back
was
broad
his
whole
figure
and
muscular
he
wore
a
thick
beard
of
so
fair
a
shade
that
it
was
almost
white
his
whole
colour
was
pale
and
yet
in
some
way
expressive
of
immense
health
and
vitality
his
lips
showed
through
his
beard
and
moustache
red
and
very
thick
his
every
movement
showed
great
and
confidence
he
had
indeed
far
more
personality
than
any
other
member
of
our
otriad
although
he
was
an
extremely
capable
doctor
his
main
business
in
life
seemed
to
be
he
apparently
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
restraint
the
serious
questions
in
life
to
him
were
food
drink
women
he
believed
in
no
woman
virtue
and
no
man
sincerity
he
hailed
any
one
as
a
friend
but
if
he
considered
some
one
a
fool
he
said
so
immediately
he
concealed
his
opinions
from
no
one
when
he
was
at
work
his
indulgence
seemed
for
the
moment
to
leave
him
he
was
a
surgeon
of
the
first
order
and
loved
his
profession
he
was
a
man
now
of
fifty
but
had
never
married
preferring
a
long
succession
of
mistresses
women
who
had
loved
him
at
whom
he
had
always
laughed
to
whom
he
had
been
kind
in
a
careless
fashion
he
always
declared
that
no
woman
had
ever
touched
his
heart
he
had
come
to
the
war
voluntarily
forsaking
a
very
lucrative
practice
this
was
always
a
puzzle
to
me
he
had
no
romantic
notions
about
the
war
no
altruistic
compulsions
no
high
conceptions
of
his
duty
no
one
had
worked
more
magnificently
in
the
war
than
he
he
could
not
be
said
to
be
popular
amongst
us
we
were
all
of
us
perhaps
a
little
afraid
of
him
he
cared
so
obviously
for
none
of
us
but
we
admired
his
vitality
his
courage
his
independence
i
myself
was
assured
that
he
allowed
us
to
see
him
only
with
the
most
casual
superficiality
as
he
rode
up
to
me
i
wondered
how
he
and
nikitin
would
fare
these
were
two
personalities
worthy
of
attention
also
what
would
he
think
of
trenchard
his
opinion
of
any
one
had
great
weight
amongst
us
i
had
not
seen
him
last
night
and
he
leant
over
his
horse
now
and
shook
hands
with
me
with
a
warm
friendliness
that
surprised
me
he
laughed
joked
was
evidently
in
excellent
spirits
he
rode
on
a
little
then
came
back
to
us
i
like
your
new
sister
he
said
she
charming
she
engaged
i
answered
to
the
new
englishman
ah
the
new
englishman
he
laughed
apologies
ivan
andreievitch
myself
to
your
country
but
really
what
he
going
to
do
with
us
he
work
i
said
surprised
at
the
heat
that
i
felt
in
defence
he
a
splendid
fellow
i
have
no
doubt
again
semyonov
laughed
we
all
know
your
enthusiasms
ivan
andreievitch
but
an
englishman
engaged
to
that
girl
i
heard
him
repeat
to
himself
as
again
he
rode
forward
trenchard
little
andrey
vassilievitch
semyonov
nikitin
yes
there
was
promise
of
much
development
here
we
had
dropped
down
into
the
valley
and
at
a
sudden
turn
saw
the
in
front
of
us
it
is
before
me
now
as
i
write
with
its
long
low
whitewashed
front
its
its
roof
faintly
pink
with
a
dark
red
perched
on
the
top
behind
it
is
a
long
green
field
stretching
to
where
hills
faintly
blue
in
the
morning
light
rose
with
very
gradual
slopes
against
the
sky
to
the
right
i
could
see
there
was
a
garden
hidden
now
by
trees
on
the
left
a
fine
old
barn
its
thatched
roof
deep
brown
the
props
supporting
it
black
with
age
in
front
of
the
pillared
porch
there
was
a
little
square
of
white
and
in
the
middle
of
these
an
old
grey
sundial
the
whole
place
was
bathed
in
the
absolute
peace
of
the
spring
morning
as
we
drove
up
a
little
old
lady
with
two
tiny
children
clinging
to
her
skirts
came
to
the
porch
i
could
see
as
we
came
up
to
her
that
she
was
trembling
with
terror
she
put
up
her
hand
to
her
white
hair
clutched
again
desperately
the
two
children
found
at
last
her
voice
and
hoped
that
we
would
be
indulgent
molozov
assured
her
that
she
would
suffer
in
no
kind
of
way
that
we
must
use
her
school
for
a
week
or
so
and
that
any
loss
or
damage
that
she
incurred
would
of
course
be
made
up
to
her
she
was
then
of
a
sudden
immensely
fluent
explaining
that
her
husband
a
most
excellent
husband
to
me
in
every
way
one
might
say
had
been
dead
fifteen
years
now
that
her
two
sons
were
both
fighting
for
the
austrians
that
she
looked
after
the
school
assisted
by
her
daughter
these
were
her
grandchildren
such
a
terrible
year
she
in
all
her
long
life
had
never
remembered
she
the
arrival
of
the
rest
of
the
oboz
silenced
her
she
remained
with
staring
eyes
her
hand
at
her
breast
watching
saying
to
the
children
now
katya
now
anna
see
what
you
about
the
school
was
spotlessly
clean
in
the
schoolroom
the
rough
benches
were
marked
with
names
and
crosses
on
the
whitewashed
walls
were
coloured
maps
of
galicia
and
tables
of
the
austrian
kings
and
queens
on
the
blackboard
still
an
unfinished
arithmetical
sum
and
on
the
master
desk
a
pile
of
exercise
books
in
a
moment
everything
was
changed
the
sanitars
had
turned
the
schoolroom
into
a
dormitory
another
room
was
to
be
our
another
a
bedroom
for
the
sisters
in
the
high
raftered
kitchen
our
midday
meal
was
already
cooking
the
little
cobbled
court
was
piled
high
with
luggage
in
the
field
beyond
the
house
the
sanitars
had
pitched
their
tents
i
walked
out
into
the
little
garden
a
charming
place
with
yew
hedges
a
well
and
old
thick
and
here
i
found
an
old
man
in
a
straw
hat
tending
the
bees
the
hives
were
open
and
he
was
working
with
a
knife
whilst
the
bees
hung
in
a
trembling
hovering
cloud
about
him
i
spoke
to
him
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
me
at
all
i
watched
him
then
spoke
again
he
straightened
himself
then
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
with
eyes
full
of
scorn
words
of
fury
of
abuse
perhaps
seemed
to
tremble
on
his
lips
then
shaking
his
head
he
turned
his
back
upon
me
and
continued
his
work
behind
us
i
could
hear
the
soldiers
breaking
the
to
make
stakes
for
their
tents
here
we
were
for
a
fortnight
and
it
was
strange
to
me
in
the
days
of
stress
and
excitement
that
followed
to
look
back
to
that
fortnight
and
remember
that
we
had
so
many
of
us
been
restless
and
discontented
at
the
quiet
of
it
oddly
enough
of
all
the
many
backgrounds
that
were
during
the
next
months
to
follow
in
procession
behind
me
there
only
remain
to
me
with
enduring
vitality
this
at
o
the
banks
of
the
river
nestor
which
i
had
indeed
good
reason
to
remember
and
finally
the
forest
of
s
how
strange
a
contrast
that
with
its
little
garden
and
white
cobbles
and
that
forest
which
will
to
the
end
of
my
life
ever
haunt
my
dreams
and
yet
by
its
very
contrast
how
fitting
a
background
to
our
prologue
this
made
i
wonder
whether
nikitin
sees
it
still
in
his
visions
trenchard
and
semyonov
does
it
mean
anything
to
them
where
they
now
are
first
of
them
all
marie
ivanovna
i
see
her
still
bending
over
the
well
looking
down
then
suddenly
flinging
her
head
back
laughing
as
we
stood
behind
her
the
sunlight
through
the
flashing
in
her
eyes
that
fortnight
must
be
to
many
of
us
of
how
ironic
of
how
tragic
a
tranquillity
so
we
settled
down
and
did
our
best
to
become
happily
accustomed
to
one
another
our
own
immediate
company
numbered
twenty
or
so
molozov
two
doctors
myself
trenchard
and
andrey
vassilievitch
the
two
new
sisters
and
the
three
former
ones
five
or
six
young
russians
gentlemen
of
ease
and
leisure
who
had
had
some
bandaging
practice
at
the
petrograd
hospitals
and
three
very
young
medical
students
directly
attached
to
our
two
doctors
in
addition
to
these
there
were
the
doctors
sisters
and
students
belonging
to
the
army
itself
the
division
of
the
ninth
army
these
sometimes
lived
with
us
and
sometimes
by
themselves
they
had
at
their
head
colonel
oblonsky
a
military
doctor
of
much
experience
and
wide
knowledge
there
were
also
the
regular
sanitars
some
thirty
or
forty
men
who
were
often
by
profession
schoolmasters
or
small
merchants
of
a
better
class
for
the
most
part
than
the
ordinary
soldier
it
is
not
of
course
my
intention
to
describe
with
any
detail
the
individuals
of
this
company
i
have
chosen
already
those
of
us
who
are
especially
concerned
with
my
present
history
but
these
others
made
a
continually
fluctuating
and
variable
background
at
first
confusing
and
to
a
stranger
almost
terrifying
when
the
army
doctors
and
sisters
dined
with
us
we
numbered
from
thirty
to
forty
persons
sometimes
also
the
officers
of
the
staff
of
the
came
to
our
table
there
were
other
occasions
when
every
one
was
engaged
on
one
business
or
another
and
only
three
or
four
of
us
were
left
at
the
central
station
or
punkt
as
it
was
called
and
of
all
these
persons
who
now
stands
out
i
can
remember
a
sister
short
plain
with
red
hair
who
felt
that
she
was
treated
with
insufficient
dignity
whose
voice
rising
in
complaint
is
with
me
now
i
can
see
her
small
eyes
watching
for
some
insult
and
then
the
curl
of
her
lip
as
she
snatched
her
opportunity
or
there
was
the
jolly
fat
sister
who
had
travelled
with
us
an
admirable
worker
but
a
woman
apparently
with
no
personal
life
at
all
no
excitements
dreads
angers
dejections
upon
her
the
war
made
no
impression
at
all
she
spoke
sometimes
to
us
of
her
husband
and
her
children
she
was
not
greedy
nor
patriotic
neither
vain
nor
humble
neither
egoistic
nor
unselfish
she
was
simply
reliable
or
there
was
the
tall
gaunt
sister
intensely
religious
and
serious
she
was
regarded
by
all
of
us
as
an
excellent
woman
but
of
course
we
did
not
like
her
one
would
say
to
another
sister
k
what
an
excellent
worker
yes
how
she
works
splendid
splendid
when
owing
to
the
illness
of
her
old
mother
she
was
compelled
to
return
to
petrograd
what
relief
we
all
felt
how
gay
was
our
supper
the
night
of
her
departure
there
was
something
very
childish
at
the
heart
of
all
of
us
of
the
young
gentlemen
from
petrograd
i
remember
only
three
the
family
name
of
one
was
ivanoff
but
he
was
always
known
to
the
otriad
as
goga
a
pet
diminutive
of
george
he
was
perhaps
the
youngest
person
whom
i
have
ever
known
he
must
have
been
eighteen
years
of
age
he
looked
about
eleven
with
a
round
red
face
and
eyes
that
expressed
eternal
astonishment
like
toots
his
mind
was
continually
occupied
with
his
tailor
and
he
told
me
on
several
occasions
that
he
hoped
i
should
visit
him
in
petrograd
because
there
in
the
house
of
his
mother
he
had
many
splendid
suits
shirts
ties
that
it
would
give
him
pleasure
to
show
me
in
spite
of
this
little
weakness
he
showed
a
most
energetic
character
willing
to
do
anything
for
anybody
eager
to
please
the
whole
world
i
can
hear
his
voice
now
ivan
andreievitch
imagine
my
position
there
was
general
polinoff
and
the
whole
staff
what
to
do
only
three
versts
from
the
position
too
and
already
six
or
there
was
another
serious
gentleman
whose
mind
was
continually
occupied
with
russia
it
may
be
difficult
for
you
ivan
andreievitch
to
see
with
our
eyes
but
for
those
of
us
who
have
russia
in
our
hearts
what
rest
or
peace
can
there
be
i
can
assure
you
he
wore
and
with
his
long
head
shaven
to
the
skin
his
white
cheeks
protruding
chin
and
long
heavy
white
hands
he
resembled
nothing
so
much
as
a
large
fish
hanging
on
a
nail
at
a
fishmonger
he
worked
always
in
a
kind
of
cold
desperate
despair
his
slipping
off
his
shiny
nose
his
mouth
set
grimly
what
is
the
use
he
seemed
to
say
of
helping
these
poor
wounded
soldiers
when
russia
is
in
such
a
desperate
condition
tell
me
that
or
there
was
a
wild
rough
fellow
from
some
town
in
little
russia
a
boy
of
the
most
primitive
character
no
manners
at
all
and
a
heart
of
shining
gold
of
life
he
had
the
very
wildest
notions
he
loved
women
and
would
sing
southern
russian
songs
about
them
he
had
a
strain
of
fantasy
that
continually
surprised
one
he
liked
fairy
tales
he
would
say
to
me
there
a
tale
ivan
andreievitch
about
a
princess
who
lived
on
a
lake
of
glass
there
was
a
forest
you
know
round
the
lake
and
all
the
trees
were
of
gold
the
pond
was
guarded
by
three
dwarfs
i
myself
ivan
andreievitch
have
seen
a
dwarf
in
kiev
no
higher
than
your
leg
and
in
our
town
they
say
there
was
once
a
whole
family
of
dwarfs
who
lived
in
a
house
in
the
chief
street
in
our
town
and
sold
potatoes
i
do
know
people
tell
one
such
things
but
for
the
rest
of
that
tale
do
you
remember
how
it
goes
he
could
ride
any
horse
carry
any
man
was
never
tired
nor
out
of
heart
he
had
the
vaguest
ideas
about
the
war
i
knew
a
german
once
in
our
town
he
told
me
i
always
hated
him
he
was
going
to
petrograd
to
make
his
fortune
i
hope
he
dead
this
fellow
was
called
petrov
my
chief
interest
during
this
fortnight
was
to
watch
the
fortunes
of
marie
ivanovna
and
trenchard
with
their
new
companions
it
was
instantly
apparent
that
marie
ivanovna
was
a
success
on
the
second
day
after
our
arrival
at
the
there
were
continual
exclamations
but
how
charming
the
new
sister
how
sympathetic
have
you
talked
to
the
new
sister
even
sister
k
so
serious
and
religious
approved
it
was
evident
at
once
that
marie
ivanovna
was
on
her
side
delighted
with
every
one
i
could
see
that
at
present
she
was
assured
that
what
she
wanted
from
life
would
be
granted
to
her
she
gave
herself
with
complete
confidence
to
any
one
and
every
one
and
with
that
triumphing
vitality
that
one
felt
in
her
from
the
first
moment
of
meeting
her
she
carried
all
before
her
in
the
hospital
at
petrograd
they
had
been
i
gathered
all
serious
and
old
had
treated
her
i
fancy
with
some
sternness
here
at
any
rate
serious
and
old
she
would
not
find
us
we
welcomed
with
joy
her
youth
her
enthusiasm
her
happiness
semyonov
who
never
disguised
nor
restrained
his
feelings
was
from
the
first
instant
strangely
attracted
to
her
she
i
could
see
liked
him
very
much
felt
in
him
his
strength
and
capacity
and
scorn
of
others
molozov
also
yielded
her
his
instant
admiration
he
always
avoided
any
close
personal
relationship
with
any
of
us
but
i
could
see
that
he
was
delighted
with
her
vitality
and
energy
she
pleased
the
older
sisters
by
her
frank
and
quite
honest
desire
to
be
told
things
and
the
younger
sisters
by
her
equally
honest
admiration
of
their
gifts
and
qualities
she
was
honest
and
sincere
i
do
believe
in
every
word
and
thought
and
action
she
had
in
many
ways
the
naive
purity
the
unconsidered
faith
and
confidence
of
a
child
still
in
the
nursery
she
amazed
me
sometimes
by
her
ignorance
she
delighted
me
frequently
by
her
refreshing
truth
and
straightforwardness
she
felt
a
little
i
think
that
i
did
not
yield
her
quite
the
extravagant
admiration
of
the
others
i
was
trenchard
friend
yes
i
was
now
trenchard
friend
what
had
occurred
since
that
night
in
the
train
when
i
had
felt
during
the
greater
part
of
the
time
nothing
but
irritation
frankly
i
do
not
know
it
may
be
partly
that
he
was
given
to
me
by
the
rest
of
the
otriad
he
was
spoken
of
now
as
my
englishman
and
then
poor
trenchard
how
during
this
fortnight
he
was
unhappy
it
had
begun
with
him
as
i
had
foreseen
in
the
first
place
he
had
been
dismayed
and
silenced
by
the
garrulity
of
his
new
companions
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
understood
nothing
of
their
conversation
that
he
was
in
the
way
that
finally
he
was
more
lonely
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
before
then
however
strongly
he
might
to
himself
deny
it
he
had
arrived
in
russia
with
what
nikitin
called
his
romantic
notions
he
had
read
his
dostoevski
and
turgenev
he
had
looked
at
those
books
of
russian
impressions
that
deal
in
nothing
but
snow
ikons
and
the
sublime
simplicity
of
the
russian
peasant
he
was
a
man
whose
circumstances
had
led
him
to
believe
profoundly
in
his
own
incapacity
unpopularity
ignorance
for
a
moment
his
love
had
given
him
a
new
confidence
but
now
how
was
that
same
love
deserting
him
he
had
foreseen
a
glorious
campaign
his
lady
and
himself
side
by
side
death
and
terror
flying
before
him
he
found
himself
leading
a
country
life
of
perfect
quiet
and
comfort
even
as
he
might
have
led
it
in
england
with
a
crowd
of
people
strangely
unfamiliar
to
him
driving
him
as
he
had
been
driven
in
the
old
days
into
a
host
of
awkwardnesses
confusions
and
foolishnesses
i
could
not
forgive
marie
ivanovna
for
her
disappointment
in
him
and
yet
i
could
understand
how
different
he
must
have
appeared
to
her
during
those
last
days
in
petrograd
when
alone
with
her
and
on
fire
with
love
he
had
shown
his
true
and
bravest
self
to
her
she
was
impatient
she
had
hoped
that
the
others
would
see
him
as
she
had
seen
him
she
watched
them
as
they
expressed
their
surprise
that
he
was
not
the
practical
fearless
and
unimaginative
englishman
who
was
their
typical
figure
whilst
he
found
them
far
from
the
karamazovs
the
raskolnikoffs
of
his
imagination
they
in
their
turn
could
not
create
the
sportsman
and
man
of
affairs
whom
they
had
expected
to
all
of
this
semyonov
added
beyond
question
his
personal
weight
he
had
from
the
first
declared
trenchard
a
ridiculous
figure
whilst
the
others
were
unfailingly
kind
hospitable
and
even
indulgent
to
trenchard
semyonov
was
openly
satirical
making
no
attempt
to
hide
his
sarcastic
irony
i
do
not
know
how
much
trenchard
engagement
to
marie
ivanovna
had
to
do
with
this
but
i
know
that
my
englishman
could
not
to
his
misfortune
have
had
a
more
practical
more
efficient
figure
against
whom
to
be
contrasted
than
semyonov
during
these
weeks
i
think
that
i
hated
semyonov
there
was
however
one
silent
observer
of
all
this
business
upon
whose
personal
interference
i
had
not
reckoned
this
was
nikitin
who
at
the
end
of
our
first
week
at
the
broke
his
silence
in
a
conversation
with
me
nikitin
although
he
spoke
as
little
as
possible
to
any
one
had
already
had
his
effect
upon
the
otriad
they
felt
behind
his
silence
a
personality
that
might
indeed
be
equal
to
semyonov
own
by
little
andrey
vassilievitch
they
were
always
being
assured
nikitin
a
most
remarkable
man
you
may
believe
me
i
have
known
him
for
many
years
a
great
friend
of
my
poor
wife
and
mine
they
did
not
appear
to
be
great
friends
nikitin
quite
obviously
avoided
the
little
man
whenever
it
was
possible
but
then
he
avoided
us
all
upon
a
lovely
afternoon
nikitin
and
i
were
alone
in
the
wild
little
garden
he
lying
full
length
on
the
grass
i
reading
a
very
ancient
english
newspaper
with
my
back
against
a
tree
he
looked
up
at
me
with
a
swift
penetrating
glance
as
though
he
were
seeing
me
for
the
first
time
and
would
wish
at
once
to
weigh
my
character
and
abilities
your
englishman
he
said
he
not
happy
i
afraid
no
i
said
feeling
the
surprise
of
his
question
it
had
become
almost
a
tradition
with
me
that
he
never
spoke
unless
he
were
first
spoken
to
he
feels
strange
and
a
little
lonely
perhaps
natural
enough
yes
repeated
nikitin
it
natural
enough
what
did
he
come
for
oh
he
be
all
right
i
said
hastily
in
a
day
or
two
nikitin
lay
on
his
back
looking
at
the
green
layer
upon
layer
light
and
dark
with
golden
fragments
of
broken
light
leaping
in
the
breeze
from
branch
to
branch
why
did
he
come
what
did
he
expect
to
see
i
know
what
he
expected
to
see
romantic
russia
romantic
war
he
expected
to
find
us
our
hearts
exploding
with
love
god
smile
on
our
simple
faces
god
simple
faith
in
our
souls
he
has
been
told
by
his
cleverest
writers
that
russia
is
the
last
stronghold
of
god
and
war
he
thought
that
he
would
be
plunged
into
a
scene
of
smoke
and
flame
shrapnel
horror
upon
horror
danger
upon
danger
he
finds
instead
a
country
house
meals
long
and
large
no
sounds
of
cannon
not
even
an
aeroplane
are
we
kind
to
him
not
at
all
we
are
not
unkind
but
we
simply
have
other
things
to
think
about
and
because
we
are
primitive
people
we
do
what
we
want
to
do
feel
what
we
want
to
feel
and
show
quite
frankly
our
feelings
he
is
not
what
we
expected
so
that
we
prefer
to
fill
our
minds
with
things
that
do
not
give
us
trouble
later
like
all
englishmen
he
will
dismiss
us
as
savages
or
if
he
is
of
the
intellectual
kind
he
will
talk
about
our
confusing
subtleties
and
contradictions
but
we
are
neither
savages
nor
confusing
we
have
simply
a
skin
less
than
you
we
are
a
very
young
people
a
real
and
genuine
democracy
and
we
care
for
quite
simple
things
women
food
sleep
money
quite
simply
and
without
restraint
we
show
our
eagerness
our
disgust
our
disappointment
our
amusement
simply
as
the
mood
moves
us
in
moscow
they
eat
all
day
and
are
not
ashamed
why
should
they
be
in
kiev
they
think
always
about
women
and
do
not
pretend
otherwise
and
so
on
we
have
of
course
no
sense
of
time
nor
method
nor
system
if
we
were
to
think
of
these
things
we
would
be
compelled
to
use
restraint
and
that
would
bother
us
we
may
lose
the
most
important
treasure
in
the
world
by
not
keeping
an
appointment
on
the
other
hand
we
have
kept
our
freedom
we
care
for
ideas
for
which
you
care
nothing
in
england
but
we
have
a
sure
suspicion
of
all
conclusions
we
are
pessimists
one
and
all
life
can
not
be
good
we
ironically
survey
those
who
think
that
it
can
we
give
way
always
to
life
but
when
things
are
at
their
worst
then
we
are
relieved
and
even
happy
here
at
any
rate
we
are
on
safe
ground
we
have
much
sentiment
but
it
may
at
any
moment
give
way
to
some
other
emotion
we
are
therefore
never
to
be
relied
upon
as
friends
as
enemies
as
anything
you
please
except
this
that
in
the
heart
of
every
russian
there
is
a
passionate
love
of
goodness
we
are
tolerant
to
all
evil
to
all
weakness
because
we
ourselves
are
weak
we
confess
our
weakness
to
any
one
because
that
permits
us
to
indulge
in
it
but
when
we
see
in
another
goodness
strength
virtue
we
worship
it
you
may
bind
us
to
you
with
bands
of
iron
by
your
virtues
never
as
all
foreigners
think
by
your
vices
in
this
too
we
are
sentimentalists
we
may
not
believe
in
god
but
we
have
an
intense
curiosity
about
him
a
curiosity
that
with
many
of
us
never
leaves
us
alone
compels
us
to
fill
our
lives
to
fill
our
lives
we
love
russia
but
that
is
another
thing
never
forget
too
that
behind
every
russian
simplicity
there
is
always
his
ideal
his
secret
ideal
perhaps
that
he
keeps
like
an
ikon
sacred
in
his
heart
yes
of
every
russian
even
of
the
worst
of
us
that
is
true
and
it
complicates
our
lives
delivers
us
to
our
enemies
defeats
all
our
worldly
aims
renders
us
helpless
at
the
moment
when
we
should
be
most
strong
but
it
is
good
before
god
that
it
should
be
so
he
suddenly
sprang
up
and
stood
before
me
i
shall
think
otherwise
and
yet
this
is
part
of
the
truth
that
i
have
told
you
and
your
englishman
i
like
him
i
like
him
that
girl
will
treat
him
badly
of
course
how
can
she
do
otherwise
he
sees
her
like
turgenev
liza
well
she
is
not
that
no
girl
in
russia
is
like
turgenev
liza
and
it
a
good
thing
he
smiled
that
strange
happy
confident
mysterious
smile
that
i
had
seen
first
on
the
petrograd
platform
then
he
turned
and
walked
slowly
towards
the
house
what
nikitin
had
said
about
trenchard
expectation
of
romantic
war
was
perhaps
true
in
different
degrees
of
all
of
us
even
i
in
spite
of
my
earlier
experience
felt
some
irritation
at
this
delay
and
to
those
of
us
who
had
arrived
flaming
with
energy
bravery
resolution
to
make
their
name
before
europe
this
feasting
in
a
country
garden
seemed
a
deliberate
insult
was
this
romantic
war
these
long
meals
under
the
trees
deep
sleeps
in
the
afternoon
when
the
pigeons
cooed
round
the
little
red
and
the
pump
creaked
in
the
cobbled
courtyard
and
the
bees
hummed
in
the
garden
bees
cold
water
shining
deep
in
the
well
and
the
samovar
chuckling
behind
the
and
fifteen
versts
away
the
austrians
challenging
the
russian
nation
you
know
andrey
vassilievitch
said
to
me
it
very
disheartening
marie
ivanovna
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
spoke
her
mind
i
found
her
one
evening
before
supper
leaning
over
the
fence
gazing
across
the
long
flat
field
pale
gold
in
the
dusk
with
the
hills
like
grey
clouds
beyond
it
they
tell
me
she
said
turning
to
me
that
we
may
be
another
fortnight
like
this
yes
i
said
it
quite
possible
or
even
longer
we
ca
provide
wounded
and
battles
for
you
if
there
are
any
but
there
are
she
cried
is
the
whole
of
europe
fighting
and
is
it
simply
disgusting
of
us
to
be
sitting
down
here
eating
and
sleeping
just
as
though
we
were
in
a
in
the
country
at
least
in
the
hospital
in
petrograd
i
was
working
here
we
got
to
stick
to
our
division
i
answered
they
ca
have
it
in
reserve
very
long
when
it
goes
we
go
the
whole
secret
of
leading
this
life
out
here
is
taking
exactly
what
comes
as
completely
as
you
can
take
it
if
it
a
time
for
sleeping
and
eating
sleep
and
eat
there
be
days
enough
when
you
get
nothing
of
either
she
laughed
then
swinging
round
to
me
with
the
dusk
round
her
white
nurse
cap
and
her
eyes
dark
with
her
desires
and
hopes
and
disappointments
oh
i
no
right
to
be
discontented
every
one
is
so
good
to
me
i
love
them
all
even
you
durward
but
i
want
to
begin
to
begin
to
begin
i
want
to
see
what
it
like
to
find
what
there
is
there
that
frightens
them
or
makes
them
happy
we
had
a
young
officer
in
our
hospital
who
died
he
was
too
ill
he
could
tell
us
nothing
but
he
was
so
excited
by
something
something
he
was
in
the
middle
of
who
was
it
what
was
it
i
be
there
hunt
it
out
find
that
i
strong
enough
not
to
be
afraid
of
she
suddenly
dropped
her
voice
changing
with
sharp
abruptness
and
john
he
not
happy
here
is
he
you
should
know
i
answered
better
than
any
of
us
why
should
i
know
she
replied
flaming
out
at
me
you
always
blame
me
about
him
but
you
are
unfair
i
want
him
to
be
happy
i
would
make
him
so
if
i
could
but
he
so
strange
so
different
from
his
time
at
the
hospital
he
will
scarcely
speak
to
me
or
to
any
one
why
ca
he
be
agreeable
to
every
one
i
want
them
to
like
him
but
how
can
they
when
he
wo
talk
to
them
and
runs
away
if
they
come
near
him
disappointed
perhaps
at
its
being
so
quiet
here
it
is
what
he
expected
to
find
it
but
then
is
that
the
same
for
all
of
us
and
do
sulk
all
day
he
disappointed
with
perhaps
but
he
wo
tell
me
what
he
wants
if
i
ask
him
he
only
says
it
all
it
all
i
hate
that
of
your
language
so
stupid
what
a
purpose
not
to
say
if
he
wants
something
i
said
nothing
my
silence
urged
her
to
a
warmer
defence
and
then
he
makes
such
mistakes
always
everything
wrong
that
asked
to
do
doctor
semyonov
laughs
at
him
but
of
course
he
like
a
little
boy
a
man
as
old
as
he
is
and
englishmen
are
always
so
practical
capable
oh
speak
to
him
durward
you
can
please
if
say
anything
he
at
once
so
miserable
i
do
understand
i
do
understand
she
cried
raising
her
hands
with
a
little
despairing
gesture
how
can
he
have
been
like
that
in
petrograd
and
now
like
this
give
him
time
marie
ivanovna
i
answered
her
this
is
all
new
to
him
confusing
alarming
he
led
a
very
quiet
life
he
very
sensitive
he
cares
for
you
so
deeply
that
the
slightest
thing
wounds
him
he
would
hide
that
if
he
could
it
his
tragedy
that
he
ca
she
would
have
answered
had
not
supper
arrived
and
with
it
our
whole
company
shall
i
ever
know
a
more
beautiful
night
as
we
sat
there
the
moon
came
up
and
full
the
stars
were
clustered
so
thickly
between
the
trees
that
their
light
lay
heavy
like
smoke
upon
the
air
the
little
garden
seemed
to
be
never
still
as
our
candlelight
blew
in
the
breeze
so
it
hovered
and
trembled
about
us
the
trees
bending
beneath
their
precious
load
of
stars
shuddering
in
their
happiness
at
so
good
an
evening
we
sat
there
as
though
we
had
known
that
it
was
to
be
our
last
night
of
peace
many
times
the
glasses
of
tea
were
filled
many
times
the
little
blue
tin
boxes
of
sweets
were
pushed
up
and
down
the
table
many
times
the
china
teapot
on
the
top
of
the
samovar
was
fed
with
fresh
tea
many
times
spoons
were
dipped
into
the
strawberry
jam
and
then
plunged
into
the
glasses
of
tea
such
being
the
russian
pleasure
there
occurred
then
an
unfortunate
incident
some
one
had
said
something
about
england
there
had
been
a
joke
then
about
sportsmen
some
allusion
was
made
to
some
old
story
connected
with
myself
and
i
had
laughingly
taken
up
the
challenge
suddenly
semyonov
leaned
across
the
table
and
spoke
to
trenchard
trenchard
who
had
been
silent
throughout
the
meal
misunderstood
the
russian
thought
that
semyonov
was
trying
to
insult
him
and
sat
there
colouring
flaming
at
last
silent
we
all
of
us
felt
the
awkwardness
of
it
there
was
a
general
pause
semyonov
himself
drew
back
with
a
little
laugh
suddenly
marie
ivanovna
across
the
table
in
english
said
softly
but
with
a
strange
eager
hostility
how
absurd
to
let
them
all
see
to
let
them
know
perhaps
i
who
was
sitting
next
to
her
alone
heard
her
words
the
colour
left
trenchard
face
he
looked
at
her
once
then
got
up
and
left
the
table
i
could
see
then
that
she
was
distressed
but
she
talked
laughed
more
eagerly
more
enthusiastically
than
before
sometimes
i
saw
her
look
towards
the
when
there
came
an
opportunity
i
rose
and
went
to
find
him
he
was
standing
near
his
bed
his
back
to
the
door
his
hands
clenched
i
say
come
out
again
just
as
though
nothing
had
happened
no
one
noticed
anything
only
i
he
turned
to
me
his
face
working
and
with
a
passionate
gesture
in
a
voice
that
choked
over
the
words
he
cried
she
should
not
have
said
it
she
should
not
every
one
there
she
knew
how
it
would
wound
me
semyonov
he
positively
was
silent
over
that
name
the
mild
expression
of
his
eyes
the
clumsy
kindness
of
his
mouth
gave
a
ludicrous
expression
to
his
rage
wait
wait
i
cried
be
patient
as
i
spoke
i
could
hear
him
in
the
railway
carriage
i
am
mad
with
happiness
god
forgive
me
my
heart
will
break
breaking
from
me
despair
in
his
voice
he
whispered
to
the
empty
room
the
desolate
row
of
white
beds
watching
him
i
always
knew
that
i
was
hopeless
hopeless
hopeless
look
here
i
said
you
must
take
things
so
hard
you
go
up
and
down
your
emotions
but
he
only
shook
his
head
she
should
have
said
it
like
that
before
every
one
he
repeated
i
left
him
afterwards
as
i
stood
in
the
passage
white
and
ghostly
in
the
moonlight
something
suddenly
told
me
that
this
night
the
prologue
of
our
drama
was
concluded
i
waited
on
the
steps
of
the
house
heard
the
laughing
voices
in
the
distance
while
over
the
rest
of
the
world
there
was
absolute
silence
then
abruptly
quite
sharply
across
the
long
low
fields
there
came
the
rumble
of
cannon
three
times
it
sounded
then
hearing
no
more
i
returned
into
the
house
chapter
iii
the
invisible
battle
on
the
evening
of
the
following
day
trenchard
andrey
vassilievitch
and
i
were
sent
with
sanitars
and
wagons
to
the
little
hamlet
of
m
five
versts
only
from
the
position
it
was
night
when
we
arrived
there
no
sound
of
cannon
only
on
the
high
hills
the
first
lines
of
the
carpathians
that
faced
us
the
scattered
watchfires
of
our
own
division
and
in
the
little
village
street
a
line
of
cavalry
moving
silently
without
a
spoken
word
on
to
the
beyond
after
much
difficulty
the
village
was
filled
with
the
officers
of
the
we
found
a
kitchen
in
which
we
might
sleep
upon
the
rough
earth
floor
our
mattresses
were
spread
my
feet
under
the
huge
black
oven
my
head
beneath
a
gilt
picture
of
the
virgin
and
child
that
in
the
candlelight
bowed
and
smiled
in
company
with
eight
other
pictures
of
virgins
and
children
to
give
us
confidence
and
encouragement
it
was
a
terrible
night
on
a
high
pillared
bed
set
into
the
farther
wall
an
old
galician
woman
her
head
bound
up
in
a
red
handkerchief
knelt
all
night
and
prayed
aloud
her
daughter
crouched
against
the
wall
sleeping
perhaps
but
nevertheless
rocking
ceaselessly
a
wooden
cradle
that
hung
from
a
black
bar
in
the
ceiling
in
this
cradle
lay
her
son
aged
one
or
two
and
once
and
again
he
cried
for
half
an
hour
or
so
protesting
i
suppose
against
our
invasion
there
was
a
smell
in
the
kitchen
of
sour
bread
mice
and
bad
water
the
heat
was
terrible
but
the
old
lady
told
us
that
the
grandchild
was
ill
and
would
certainly
die
were
the
window
opened
the
candle
we
blew
out
but
there
remained
a
little
burning
lamp
under
the
picture
of
the
virgin
immediately
over
the
old
lady
bed
i
slept
but
for
how
long
i
do
not
know
i
was
only
aware
that
suddenly
i
was
awake
staring
through
the
tiny
window
at
the
faint
white
light
now
breaking
in
the
sky
i
could
see
from
my
mattress
only
a
thin
strip
of
this
light
above
the
heavy
mass
of
dark
forest
on
the
i
must
have
been
still
only
because
i
could
not
clearly
divide
before
my
eyes
the
true
from
the
false
i
could
see
quite
plainly
in
the
dim
white
shadow
the
face
of
trenchard
he
was
not
asleep
but
was
leaning
on
his
elbow
staring
in
front
of
him
i
could
see
the
old
woman
with
her
red
handkerchief
kneeling
in
front
of
her
lamp
and
her
prayer
came
like
the
turning
of
a
wheel
harsh
and
incessant
the
cradle
creaked
in
the
air
was
the
heavy
smell
and
suddenly
beyond
the
window
a
cock
crowed
these
things
were
real
but
also
i
seemed
to
be
in
some
place
much
vaster
than
the
stuffy
kitchen
of
the
night
before
under
the
light
that
was
with
every
minute
growing
stronger
i
could
fancy
that
many
figures
were
moving
in
the
shadows
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
i
were
in
some
place
where
great
preparations
were
being
made
i
fancied
then
that
i
could
discern
marie
ivanovna
figure
then
nikitin
then
semyonov
then
molozov
there
was
a
great
silence
but
i
felt
that
every
one
was
busily
occupied
in
making
ready
for
some
affair
this
was
with
half
my
consciousness
with
the
other
half
i
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
actual
room
of
trenchard
the
creaking
cradle
and
the
rest
then
the
forest
that
had
been
on
the
hills
seemed
to
draw
closer
to
the
house
i
felt
that
it
had
invaded
the
garden
and
that
its
very
branches
were
rubbing
against
the
windows
with
all
of
this
i
was
aware
that
i
was
imagining
some
occurrence
that
i
had
already
seen
that
was
not
in
any
way
new
to
me
i
was
assured
of
the
next
event
when
we
all
of
us
marie
ivanovna
semyonov
nikitin
and
the
rest
were
ready
we
should
move
out
into
the
forest
would
stand
a
vast
company
with
our
dogs
and
horses
why
it
was
trenchard
dream
that
i
was
seeing
i
was
merely
repeating
to
myself
his
own
imaginations
and
with
that
i
had
suddenly
as
though
some
one
had
hypnotised
me
fallen
back
into
a
heavy
dreamless
sleep
it
was
already
midday
when
i
was
wakened
by
little
andrey
vassilievitch
who
sitting
on
my
bed
and
evidently
in
a
state
of
the
very
greatest
excitement
informed
me
that
semyonov
and
the
sisters
marie
ivanovna
and
anna
petrovna
had
arrived
from
and
that
we
might
be
off
at
any
moment
i
was
aware
as
he
spoke
of
a
great
stir
beyond
the
window
and
saw
passing
up
through
the
valley
a
flood
of
soldiers
infantry
cavalry
kitchens
with
clumsy
black
funnels
bobbing
on
their
unsteady
wheels
cannon
hundreds
of
carts
the
soldiers
came
up
through
our
own
garden
treading
down
the
cabbages
stopping
at
the
well
near
our
door
and
filling
their
tin
kettles
tramping
up
the
road
spreading
like
smoke
in
the
far
distance
up
the
high
road
that
led
into
the
furthest
forest
they
say
for
certain
said
andrey
vassilievitch
his
fat
hand
trembling
on
my
bed
he
began
to
talk
his
voice
shaking
with
excitement
do
you
know
ivan
andreievitch
i
am
continually
surprised
at
myself
you
are
andrey
vassilievitch
here
at
the
war
what
do
you
make
of
it
i
say
to
myself
just
consider
no
but
seriously
ivan
andreievitch
of
course
i
must
seem
to
all
of
you
something
of
a
comic
figure
when
my
wife
was
alive
how
i
wish
that
you
could
have
known
her
such
a
remarkable
woman
every
one
who
met
her
was
struck
by
her
fine
character
when
my
wife
was
alive
i
had
my
position
to
support
that
i
should
have
been
a
comic
figure
would
have
distressed
her
but
now
who
cares
nobody
you
may
very
truly
say
well
well
but
the
point
is
that
this
evening
we
shall
really
be
in
the
thick
of
it
and
may
i
tell
you
something
ivan
andreievitch
only
for
yourself
because
you
are
an
englishman
and
can
be
trusted
to
speak
quite
truthfully
i
frightened
i
say
to
myself
that
one
is
at
the
war
and
that
one
must
be
frightened
at
nothing
and
still
i
remain
frightened
frightened
of
what
i
really
can
not
tell
you
death
perhaps
but
no
i
should
not
be
sorry
to
die
there
are
reasons
and
yet
although
i
should
not
be
sorry
to
die
i
remain
frightened
all
night
i
was
awake
i
do
my
utmost
to
control
it
but
there
is
something
stronger
than
i
something
i
feel
as
though
if
i
once
discovered
what
that
something
was
i
should
not
be
frightened
any
longer
something
definite
that
you
could
meet
and
say
to
yourself
andrey
vassilievitch
you
not
frightened
of
are
you
what
is
there
to
be
frightened
of
why
then
you
know
i
believe
i
should
be
frightened
any
more
i
remember
that
he
then
explained
to
me
that
he
wished
nikitin
had
been
sent
instead
of
semyonov
nikitin
was
much
more
sympathetic
you
seem
very
fond
of
nikitin
i
said
we
are
friends
we
have
been
friends
for
many
years
my
wife
was
very
fond
of
him
i
am
a
lonely
man
ivan
andreievitch
since
the
death
of
my
wife
and
to
be
with
any
one
who
knew
her
is
a
great
happiness
yes
a
great
happiness
and
semyonov
i
asked
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
alexei
petrovitch
he
answered
stiffly
when
later
i
joined
the
others
at
the
cottage
higher
up
the
road
taken
by
the
doctors
of
the
division
i
discovered
trenchard
in
an
ecstasy
of
happiness
he
did
not
speak
to
me
but
his
shining
eyes
the
eagerness
with
which
standing
back
from
the
group
he
watched
us
all
told
me
everything
marie
ivanovna
had
been
kind
to
him
and
when
i
found
her
in
the
centre
of
them
her
whole
body
alert
with
excitement
i
forgot
my
anger
at
her
earlier
unkindness
or
if
i
remembered
it
laid
it
to
the
charge
of
my
own
imagination
or
sensitiveness
indeed
we
were
all
excited
how
could
we
fail
to
be
there
was
some
big
business
toward
and
in
it
we
were
to
have
our
share
we
were
perhaps
this
very
day
to
penetrate
into
the
reality
of
the
thing
that
for
nine
months
now
we
had
been
watching
all
of
us
with
our
little
private
histories
like
bundles
on
our
backs
are
venturing
out
to
try
our
fortune
what
are
we
going
to
find
i
remember
indeed
that
early
on
that
afternoon
i
felt
the
drama
of
the
whole
affair
so
heavily
that
i
saw
in
every
soldier
who
passed
me
a
messenger
of
fate
they
called
me
to
a
meal
eat
now
how
absurd
it
seemed
semyonov
watched
me
cynically
eat
and
then
sleep
he
said
or
you
be
no
use
to
any
one
afterwards
i
went
back
to
the
kitchen
and
slept
that
sleep
was
the
end
of
my
melodrama
i
was
awakened
by
a
rough
hand
on
my
shoulder
to
find
it
dark
beyond
the
windows
and
semyonov
watching
me
impatiently
come
get
up
it
time
for
us
to
start
and
then
moved
out
i
was
conscious
that
i
was
cold
and
irritable
i
looked
back
with
surprised
contempt
to
my
earlier
dramatic
emotions
i
was
hungry
i
put
on
my
overcoat
shivered
came
out
into
the
evening
saw
the
line
of
wagons
silhouetted
against
the
sky
listened
to
the
perfect
quiet
on
every
side
of
me
yawned
and
was
vexed
to
find
trenchard
at
my
side
why
this
is
actually
dull
i
thought
to
myself
it
is
as
though
i
were
going
to
some
dinner
that
i
know
beforehand
will
be
exceedingly
tiresome
only
then
i
should
get
some
food
i
was
disappointed
at
the
lack
of
drama
in
the
affair
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
ten
semyonov
was
arranging
everything
with
a
masterly
disregard
of
personal
feelings
he
swore
fine
russian
oaths
abused
the
sanitars
always
in
his
cold
rather
satirical
voice
his
heavy
figure
moving
up
and
down
the
road
with
a
practical
vivid
alertness
that
stirred
my
envy
and
also
my
annoyance
i
felt
utterly
useless
he
ordered
me
on
to
my
wagon
in
a
manner
that
in
my
present
mood
seemed
to
me
abominably
abrupt
trenchard
climbed
up
very
clumsily
after
me
i
leaned
back
on
the
straw
let
my
arms
fall
and
lay
there
flat
on
my
back
staring
straight
into
the
sky
with
that
my
mood
suddenly
changed
i
was
at
peace
with
the
whole
world
was
again
thick
with
a
heavy
burden
of
stars
that
seemed
to
weigh
like
the
silver
lid
of
some
mighty
box
heavily
down
down
upon
us
until
trees
and
hills
and
the
dim
carpathians
were
bent
flat
beneath
the
pressure
i
lying
upon
my
back
seeing
only
that
sheet
of
stars
in
my
nostrils
the
smell
of
the
straw
rocked
by
the
slow
dreamy
motion
of
the
wagon
was
filled
with
an
exquisite
ease
and
lethargy
i
was
going
into
battle
was
i
i
was
to
have
the
supreme
experience
of
my
life
it
might
be
that
i
should
die
only
last
week
two
members
of
the
red
cross
a
nurse
and
a
doctor
had
been
killed
it
might
be
that
these
stars
this
straw
this
quiet
night
were
round
me
for
the
last
time
it
did
not
matter
to
me
nothing
could
touch
me
my
soul
was
somewhere
far
away
upon
some
business
of
its
own
and
how
happy
was
my
body
without
the
soul
how
contented
how
undisturbed
i
could
fancy
that
i
should
go
thus
rocking
into
battle
and
there
die
before
my
soul
had
time
to
return
to
me
what
would
my
soul
do
then
find
some
other
body
or
go
wandering
searching
for
me
a
star
a
flash
of
light
like
a
cry
of
happiness
or
of
glad
surprise
fell
through
heaven
and
the
other
stars
trembled
at
the
sight
my
wagon
stopped
with
a
jerk
some
voice
asked
what
the
devil
were
we
doing
filling
the
road
with
our
carts
at
the
exact
moment
that
a
division
wished
to
move
i
heard
semyonov
voice
very
cold
official
and
polite
then
again
well
in
god
name
hurry
then
taking
up
the
road
hurry
i
tell
you
on
we
jogged
again
trenchard
voice
came
to
me
he
had
been
it
might
be
talking
for
some
time
and
so
i
not
surprised
durward
that
you
thought
me
a
terrible
fool
to
show
my
feelings
as
i
done
this
last
fortnight
but
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
me
to
have
something
at
last
in
your
hands
that
you
dreamed
of
all
your
life
and
never
dared
to
hope
for
to
have
it
and
feel
that
at
any
moment
it
may
slip
away
and
leave
you
in
a
worse
state
than
you
were
before
i
been
wishing
these
last
weeks
that
i
never
met
her
that
i
simply
come
to
the
war
by
myself
but
now
when
she
spoke
to
me
as
she
did
asked
me
to
forgive
her
for
what
happened
last
night
my
god
durward
to
forgive
but
i
show
her
this
very
night
what
i
can
do
this
very
night
they
give
me
a
chance
wo
they
it
would
be
terrible
if
they
did
semyonov
wo
give
me
a
chance
if
he
can
help
it
what
have
i
done
to
semyonov
that
he
should
hate
me
what
have
but
i
did
answer
trenchard
that
part
of
me
that
had
any
concern
with
him
and
his
affairs
was
far
away
but
his
voice
had
stirred
some
more
active
life
in
me
i
thought
to
myself
now
will
there
be
some
concrete
definite
moment
in
this
affair
when
i
shall
say
to
myself
ah
there
it
is
there
the
heart
of
this
whole
business
the
enemy
slay
him
and
you
have
settled
the
matter
or
perhaps
ah
now
i
seen
the
secret
now
i
hunted
the
animal
to
his
lair
this
is
war
this
thing
here
now
all
my
days
i
remain
quiet
there
is
nothing
more
to
fear
or
would
it
be
perhaps
that
i
should
face
something
and
be
filled
then
with
ungovernable
terror
so
that
i
should
run
for
my
life
run
hide
me
in
the
hills
cover
up
my
days
so
that
no
one
shall
ever
find
me
again
i
raised
myself
on
my
elbow
and
looked
at
the
country
we
jolted
over
a
little
brook
brushed
through
a
thicket
of
trees
came
on
to
a
path
running
at
the
forest
foot
and
saw
on
our
left
a
little
wooden
house
a
high
wood
fire
burning
in
front
of
it
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
one
already
a
very
faint
glow
throbbed
in
the
sky
out
of
the
forest
at
long
intervals
came
a
dull
booming
sound
like
the
shutting
of
a
heavy
iron
door
the
wagons
drew
up
we
had
arrived
at
our
destination
we
shall
be
here
i
heard
semyonov
say
some
five
hours
or
so
you
better
sleep
if
you
can
a
group
of
soldiers
round
the
wood
fire
were
motionless
their
faces
glowing
their
bodies
dark
our
wagons
drawn
up
together
resembled
in
the
twilight
strange
beasts
the
two
sisters
lay
down
on
one
wagon
semyonov
andrey
vassilievitch
trenchard
and
i
on
another
my
irritated
mood
had
returned
i
had
been
the
last
to
climb
on
to
the
straw
and
the
others
had
so
settled
themselves
that
i
had
no
room
to
lie
flat
semyonov
big
body
occupied
half
the
wagon
andrey
vassilievitch
boots
touched
my
head
and
at
intervals
his
whole
body
gave
nervous
jerks
it
was
also
quite
bitterly
cold
which
was
curious
enough
after
the
warmth
of
the
earlier
nights
and
always
at
what
seemed
to
be
regular
intervals
there
came
from
the
forest
the
banging
of
the
iron
door
i
felt
a
passionate
irritation
against
andrey
vassilievitch
why
could
he
not
keep
quiet
what
after
all
was
he
doing
here
i
could
hear
that
he
was
dreaming
he
muttered
some
woman
name
sasha
sasha
sasha
ca
you
keep
still
i
whispered
to
him
but
in
the
cold
i
myself
was
trembling
the
dawn
came
at
last
with
reluctance
flushing
the
air
with
colour
then
withdrawing
into
cold
grey
clouds
then
stealing
out
once
more
behind
the
forest
in
scattered
strips
of
pale
green
gold
then
suddenly
sending
up
into
the
heaven
a
flock
of
pink
clouds
like
a
flight
of
birds
that
spread
in
extending
lines
to
the
horizon
covering
at
last
a
sky
now
faintly
blue
with
rosy
bars
the
flame
of
the
soldiers
fire
grew
faint
white
mists
rose
in
the
fields
the
cannon
in
the
forest
ceased
and
the
birds
began
i
sat
up
on
the
cart
looked
at
my
sleeping
companions
and
thought
how
unpleasant
they
looked
semyonov
like
a
dead
man
andrey
vassilievitch
like
a
happy
pig
trenchard
like
a
child
who
slept
after
a
scolding
i
felt
intense
loneliness
i
wanted
some
one
to
comfort
me
to
reassure
me
against
life
which
seemed
to
me
suddenly
now
perilous
and
remorseless
moreover
some
one
seemed
to
be
reviewing
my
life
for
me
and
displaying
it
to
me
laying
bare
all
its
uselessness
and
insignificance
but
i
in
no
way
a
fine
fellow
i
could
fancy
myself
crying
sleepy
and
cold
and
hungry
if
you
remove
andrey
boots
for
me
i
lie
flat
on
this
wagon
and
you
can
let
loose
every
shrapnel
in
the
world
over
my
head
and
i
never
stir
i
thought
i
was
interested
in
your
war
and
i
not
i
thought
no
discomfort
mattered
to
me
but
i
find
that
i
dislike
so
much
being
cold
and
hungry
that
it
outweighs
all
heroism
all
sense
of
danger
let
me
alone
then
something
occurred
looking
down
over
the
side
of
the
cart
i
saw
to
my
great
surprise
marie
ivanovna
you
i
whispered
hush
she
answered
come
down
i
let
myself
down
and
at
once
she
put
her
hand
into
mine
walk
with
me
just
a
little
way
she
whispered
to
those
trees
and
back
i
had
noticed
at
once
that
her
voice
trembled
now
i
perceived
that
her
whole
body
was
shaking
her
hand
gave
little
startled
quivers
under
mine
you
cold
i
said
no
i
not
cold
she
answered
still
in
a
whisper
although
we
were
now
some
way
from
the
wagons
i
frightened
durward
what
the
matter
desperately
frightened
nonsense
i
answered
her
you
frightened
never
but
i
am
i
been
terribly
all
night
and
that
sister
anna
petrovna
he
she
sometimes
confused
her
pronouns
sleeps
like
a
log
how
can
he
i
never
slept
not
for
a
moment
and
been
so
cold
and
every
time
the
cannon
sounded
i
wanted
to
run
away
oh
durward
i
so
ashamed
then
suddenly
desperately
clutching
my
hand
durward
you
never
tell
any
one
any
one
never
promise
never
a
soul
i
answered
it
only
because
you
cold
and
hungry
and
sleepy
that
you
think
you
frightened
you
not
frightened
really
but
would
you
like
me
to
wake
trenchard
and
get
him
to
come
to
you
he
be
so
happy
she
started
fiercely
from
me
never
never
why
what
you
think
you
must
never
tell
most
of
all
you
must
never
tell
him
he
must
know
nothing
the
cannon
began
again
she
caught
my
arm
and
stood
with
her
body
trembling
pressed
against
mine
i
could
feel
her
draw
a
deep
breath
as
i
looked
at
her
her
face
white
in
the
dawn
her
large
eyes
staring
like
a
child
her
body
so
young
and
slender
she
seemed
another
creature
utterly
absolutely
apart
from
the
woman
of
this
last
fortnight
look
here
i
said
to
her
sternly
you
must
go
on
like
this
you
got
work
to
do
you
simply
got
to
hold
yourself
in
to
tell
yourself
that
nothing
can
touch
you
why
you
laugh
at
me
if
i
remind
you
of
this
you
but
there
was
better
tonic
than
my
words
semyonov
voice
came
to
us
hullo
you
there
it
five
we
moving
she
drew
herself
sharply
away
from
me
she
raised
her
head
smiled
at
me
then
said
thank
you
durward
it
all
well
now
there
semyonov
let
us
go
back
she
greeted
him
with
a
voice
that
had
in
it
not
the
slightest
tremor
there
comes
now
a
difficult
matter
during
the
later
months
when
i
was
to
reflect
on
the
whole
affair
i
saw
quite
clearly
that
that
hour
between
our
leaving
the
wooden
house
and
arriving
in
the
trenches
bridged
quite
clearly
for
me
the
division
in
this
business
between
imagination
and
reality
that
is
i
was
never
after
this
to
speak
of
war
as
i
would
have
spoken
of
it
an
hour
before
i
was
never
again
to
regard
the
paraphernalia
of
it
with
the
curiosity
of
a
stranger
i
had
become
part
of
it
this
hour
then
may
be
regarded
as
in
some
ways
the
most
important
of
all
my
experiences
it
is
certainly
the
occasion
to
which
if
i
were
using
my
invention
i
should
make
the
most
here
then
is
my
difficulty
i
have
nothing
to
say
about
it
there
nothing
at
all
to
be
made
of
it
i
may
say
at
once
that
there
was
no
atom
of
drama
in
it
at
one
moment
i
was
standing
with
marie
ivanovna
under
the
sunrise
at
another
i
was
standing
behind
a
trench
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
with
a
battery
to
my
left
and
a
battery
to
my
right
a
cuckoo
somewhere
not
very
far
away
and
a
dead
man
with
his
feet
sticking
out
from
under
the
cloth
that
covered
him
peacefully
beneath
a
tree
at
my
side
there
had
of
course
been
that
drive
in
the
wagons
bumping
over
the
uneven
road
whilst
the
sun
rose
gallantly
in
the
heavens
and
the
clanging
of
the
iron
door
grew
with
every
roll
of
our
wheels
louder
and
louder
but
it
was
rather
as
though
i
had
been
lifted
in
a
sheet
from
one
life
a
life
of
speculation
of
viewing
war
from
a
superior
and
safe
distance
of
viewing
indeed
all
catastrophe
and
reality
from
that
same
distance
into
the
other
i
had
been
caught
up
had
hung
for
a
moment
in
midair
had
been
planted
in
this
new
experience
for
us
all
there
must
have
been
at
this
moment
something
of
this
passing
from
an
old
life
into
a
new
one
and
yet
i
dare
swear
that
not
for
any
one
of
us
was
there
any
drama
any
thrill
any
excitement
we
stood
a
rather
lonely
little
group
in
the
forest
clearing
whilst
the
soldiers
in
the
trench
flung
us
a
careless
glance
then
turned
back
to
their
business
of
the
day
with
an
indifference
that
showed
how
ordinary
and
drab
a
thing
custom
had
made
it
yes
we
made
a
desolate
little
group
semyonov
had
gone
to
a
house
on
the
farther
side
of
the
road
up
which
we
had
come
a
house
that
flew
the
red
cross
flag
we
had
only
the
right
to
care
for
the
wounded
of
certain
divisions
and
our
presence
had
to
be
reported
we
were
left
then
marie
ivanovna
anna
petrovna
andrey
vassilievitch
trenchard
and
i
all
rather
close
together
uncomfortable
desolate
and
shy
as
boys
feel
on
their
first
day
at
school
the
battery
on
our
left
was
very
near
to
us
and
we
could
see
the
sharp
flash
of
its
flame
behind
the
trees
the
noise
that
it
made
was
terrific
a
sharp
angry
clumsy
noise
as
though
some
huge
giant
clad
in
mail
armour
was
flinging
his
body
in
a
violent
rage
against
an
iron
door
that
echoed
through
an
empty
house
my
same
iron
door
that
i
had
heard
all
night
the
rage
of
the
giant
spread
beyond
his
immediate
little
circle
of
trees
and
one
wondered
at
the
men
in
the
trenches
because
they
were
indifferent
to
his
temper
the
noise
of
the
more
distant
batteries
was
still
as
it
had
been
before
like
the
clanging
of
many
iron
doors
very
mild
and
gentle
against
the
clamour
of
our
own
enraged
fury
the
austrian
reply
seemed
like
the
sleepy
echo
of
this
confusion
so
sleepy
and
pleasant
that
one
felt
almost
friendly
to
the
enemy
our
own
battery
was
inconsistent
in
his
raging
had
he
only
chosen
to
fling
himself
at
his
door
every
three
minutes
say
or
even
every
minute
we
could
have
prepared
ourselves
but
he
was
moved
by
nothing
apparently
but
his
own
irrational
impulse
there
would
be
a
pause
of
two
minutes
then
three
furious
explosions
then
a
pause
of
five
minutes
then
another
explosion
i
mastered
quickly
my
impulse
to
leap
into
the
air
at
every
report
by
a
kind
of
prolonged
extension
in
my
mind
of
one
report
into
another
little
andrey
vassilievitch
was
not
so
successful
at
each
explosion
his
body
jerked
as
though
it
had
been
worked
by
wires
then
he
glanced
round
to
see
whether
any
one
had
noticed
his
agitation
then
drew
himself
up
brushed
off
imaginary
dust
from
his
uniform
coughed
and
frowned
trenchard
stood
close
to
marie
ivanovna
and
looked
at
her
anxiously
once
or
twice
as
though
he
would
like
to
speak
to
her
but
she
holding
herself
very
stiffly
watched
with
sternness
the
whole
world
as
though
she
personally
had
arranged
the
spectacle
and
was
responsible
for
its
success
soon
semyonov
came
back
and
said
that
he
must
go
on
to
some
further
trenches
to
discover
the
best
position
for
us
to
my
intense
surprise
andrey
vassilievitch
asked
whether
he
might
accompany
him
i
fancy
that
he
felt
that
he
would
venture
anything
to
escape
our
adjacency
to
the
battery
so
they
departed
leaving
us
more
forlorn
than
before
we
sat
down
on
the
stretchers
anna
petrovna
fat
heavy
phlegmatic
silent
marie
ivanovna
silent
too
but
with
a
look
now
of
expectation
in
her
eyes
as
though
she
knew
that
something
was
coming
for
her
very
shortly
trenchard
near
her
trying
to
be
cheerful
but
conscious
of
the
dead
soldier
under
the
tree
from
whom
he
seemed
unable
to
remove
his
eyes
there
was
in
the
open
space
near
us
a
that
is
a
large
boiler
on
wheels
in
which
tea
is
made
to
this
the
soldiers
were
crowding
with
their
tin
cans
the
cuckoo
far
away
now
continued
his
cry
at
long
intervals
out
of
the
forest
a
wounded
soldier
would
appear
he
seemed
to
be
always
the
same
figure
sometimes
wounded
in
the
head
sometimes
in
the
leg
sometimes
in
the
stomach
sometimes
in
the
hand
but
always
the
same
with
a
look
in
his
eyes
of
mild
protest
because
this
had
happened
to
him
also
a
look
of
dumb
confidence
that
some
one
somewhere
would
make
things
right
for
him
he
came
either
to
us
or
to
the
red
cross
building
across
the
road
according
to
his
company
one
soldier
with
a
torn
thumb
cried
bitterly
looking
at
his
thumb
and
shaking
his
head
at
it
but
he
alone
showed
any
emotion
the
others
suffered
the
sting
of
the
iodine
without
a
word
walking
off
when
they
were
bandaged
or
carried
by
our
sanitars
on
the
stretchers
still
with
that
look
of
wonder
and
trust
in
their
eyes
and
how
glad
we
were
when
there
was
any
work
to
do
the
sun
rose
high
in
the
sky
the
morning
advanced
semyonov
and
andrey
vassilievitch
did
not
return
for
the
greater
part
of
the
time
we
did
not
speak
nor
move
i
was
conscious
of
an
increasing
rage
against
the
battery
i
felt
that
if
it
was
to
cease
i
might
observe
be
interested
feel
excitement
as
it
was
it
kept
everything
from
me
it
kept
everything
from
me
because
it
insistently
demanded
my
attention
like
a
vulgar
garrulous
neighbour
who
persists
in
his
tiresome
story
its
perpetual
hammering
had
soon
its
physical
effect
a
sick
headache
crept
upon
me
seized
me
held
me
i
might
look
at
the
soldiers
sleeping
now
like
dead
men
in
the
trench
i
might
look
at
the
red
cross
flag
lazily
flapping
in
the
breeze
across
the
road
i
might
look
at
the
corpse
with
the
soiled
marble
feet
under
the
tree
i
might
look
at
trenchard
and
marie
ivanovna
silent
and
unhappy
on
the
stretchers
on
anna
petrovna
comfortably
slumbering
with
an
open
mouth
i
might
listen
to
the
distant
batteries
to
the
sudden
quick
impatient
chatter
of
the
machine
guns
to
the
rattling
of
the
musketry
somewhere
far
away
where
the
river
was
i
might
watch
the
cool
green
hollows
of
the
forest
glades
the
dark
sleepy
shadows
the
bright
patches
of
burning
sky
between
the
branches
i
might
say
to
myself
that
all
these
things
together
made
the
impression
of
my
first
battle
and
then
would
know
in
my
heart
that
there
was
no
impression
at
all
no
thrill
no
drama
no
personality
only
a
sick
throb
in
my
head
and
a
cold
hand
upon
my
chest
and
a
desire
to
fling
myself
into
any
horror
any
danger
if
i
could
but
escape
this
indigestible
monotony
once
trenchard
treading
very
softly
as
though
every
one
around
him
were
asleep
came
across
and
talked
to
me
you
know
he
said
in
a
whisper
this
is
at
all
what
i
expected
you
need
whisper
i
answered
irritably
that
battery
making
such
a
noise
that
i
ca
hear
anything
you
say
yes
is
it
he
said
with
a
little
sigh
it
very
unpleasant
indeed
do
you
think
semyonov
forgotten
us
we
been
here
a
good
many
hours
and
we
are
doing
very
much
no
i
answered
we
doing
nothing
except
get
sick
headaches
there
was
a
pause
then
he
said
where
is
everything
everything
what
well
the
battle
for
instance
oh
that
down
the
hill
i
suppose
we
trying
to
cross
the
river
and
they
trying
to
prevent
us
yes
he
answered
but
that
is
exactly
what
i
mean
it
hard
to
explain
but
even
if
we
were
to
see
our
soldiers
trying
to
cross
the
river
and
the
austrians
trying
to
prevent
them
that
be
well
would
be
exactly
the
real
thing
would
it
it
would
only
be
a
kind
of
rather
unimportant
like
that
dead
man
there
but
my
headache
prevented
my
interest
in
his
speculations
i
said
nothing
he
added
as
though
to
himself
perhaps
each
individual
soldier
sees
the
real
thing
for
himself
but
ca
express
what
he
sees
as
i
still
made
no
answer
with
another
little
sigh
he
got
up
and
walked
back
on
to
the
side
of
marie
ivanovna
then
suddenly
in
the
early
hours
of
the
afternoon
to
our
intense
relief
semyonov
and
andrey
vassilievitch
appeared
semyonov
was
as
ever
short
practical
and
unemotional
been
a
long
time
i
afraid
we
found
it
difficult
to
see
exactly
where
would
be
the
best
place
and
after
all
we
got
to
separate
one
sister
wanted
at
the
red
cross
over
there
asked
for
our
help
the
other
will
come
with
me
on
to
the
position
until
this
evening
you
three
gentlemen
if
you
be
so
good
will
wait
here
until
a
wagon
comes
then
it
will
take
you
down
to
the
trenches
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
then
if
you
do
mind
i
would
like
you
to
wait
until
dusk
when
we
shall
go
out
to
fetch
the
wounded
is
that
clear
we
answered
yes
now
which
sister
will
come
with
me
marie
ivanovna
i
think
it
would
interest
you
no
danger
except
a
stray
shrapnel
or
two
will
you
come
there
leapt
upon
us
then
with
an
agitation
that
seemed
to
silence
the
very
battery
itself
trenchard
voice
no
no
marie
no
it
dangerous
semyonov
says
so
your
first
day
he
spoke
in
english
his
voice
trembling
i
turned
to
see
his
face
white
his
eyes
wide
open
and
at
the
same
time
blind
he
passionately
addressed
himself
to
marie
ivanovna
and
to
her
alone
but
she
turned
impatiently
why
of
course
doctor
i
ready
at
once
trenchard
put
his
hand
on
her
arm
you
are
not
to
go
marie
do
you
hear
i
have
a
right
i
tell
you
you
are
not
to
go
do
be
so
stupid
john
she
shook
off
his
arm
please
doctor
i
ready
semyonov
turned
to
trenchard
with
a
smile
they
all
called
him
now
it
will
be
quite
well
i
will
look
after
her
you
you
trenchard
could
not
control
his
voice
you
prevent
shrapnel
bullets
you
do
care
you
semyonov
voice
was
sharp
i
think
it
better
that
sister
marie
ivanovna
should
come
with
me
you
understand
the
rest
of
you
we
shall
meet
at
dusk
trenchard
only
said
marie
then
turned
away
from
us
anna
petrovna
who
had
said
nothing
during
this
scene
and
had
indeed
seemed
to
be
oblivious
of
it
plunged
with
her
heavy
clumsy
walk
across
the
road
to
the
red
cross
house
the
doctor
and
marie
ivanovna
disappeared
behind
the
trench
i
was
as
was
always
my
case
with
trenchard
both
sympathetic
and
irritated
it
was
difficult
for
him
of
course
but
what
did
he
expect
the
girl
to
do
could
he
have
supposed
for
a
single
moment
that
she
would
remain
could
it
be
possible
that
he
knew
her
so
little
as
that
and
why
make
a
scene
now
before
semyonov
when
he
obviously
could
do
nothing
i
knew
moreover
with
a
certainty
that
was
almost
ironic
in
its
clarity
that
marie
ivanovna
did
not
love
did
not
perhaps
even
care
for
him
by
what
moment
in
petrograd
a
moment
flaming
with
their
high
purposes
and
the
purple
shadows
of
a
russian
white
night
had
she
been
entranced
into
some
glorious
vision
of
him
on
the
very
day
that
followed
she
had
known
i
was
convinced
her
mistake
at
the
station
she
had
known
it
and
instead
of
the
fine
sir
galahad
without
reproach
of
the
previous
night
she
saw
some
figure
that
had
she
been
english
born
would
have
appeared
to
her
as
alice
white
knight
perchance
or
at
best
the
uncle
toby
or
that
most
christian
of
english
heroes
parson
adams
i
could
imagine
that
life
had
been
so
impulsive
so
straightforward
so
simple
a
thing
to
her
that
this
sudden
implication
in
an
affair
complicated
and
even
dishonest
caused
her
bitter
disquiet
looking
back
now
i
could
trace
again
and
again
the
sudden
flashes
through
her
happiness
of
this
distress
he
perhaps
should
have
perceived
it
but
i
could
understand
that
he
could
not
believe
that
his
treasure
had
at
last
after
all
these
years
been
given
to
him
for
so
brief
a
moment
he
could
not
he
would
not
believe
it
well
i
knew
that
his
eyes
must
very
soon
be
opened
to
the
truth
as
i
turned
to
see
him
sitting
on
the
stretcher
with
his
back
to
me
his
head
hanging
a
little
as
though
it
were
too
heavy
for
his
neck
his
back
bent
his
long
arms
fallen
loose
at
his
sides
i
thought
that
alice
white
knight
he
in
solemn
truth
presented
he
had
a
talent
for
doing
things
to
his
uniform
his
cap
instead
of
being
raised
in
front
was
flat
his
jacket
bulged
out
above
his
belt
and
the
straps
on
his
boot
had
broken
from
their
holdings
he
filled
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
in
moments
of
absorption
with
articles
that
he
fancied
that
he
would
need
sometimes
food
black
bread
and
sausage
sometimes
a
large
a
folding
drinking
glass
a
ball
of
string
a
notebook
these
things
protruded
or
gave
his
clothes
a
strange
bulky
look
fat
in
some
places
thin
in
others
as
i
saw
him
his
seemed
to
pierce
his
coat
i
could
fancy
with
what
agitation
his
hands
were
clenched
we
sat
down
the
three
of
us
together
and
again
the
battery
leapt
upon
us
now
the
sun
was
hot
above
the
trees
and
the
effect
of
the
noise
behind
us
was
that
we
ourselves
every
two
or
three
minutes
were
caught
up
flung
to
the
ground
recovered
breathless
exhausted
only
to
be
hurled
again
how
miserable
we
were
how
lost
how
desolate
trenchard
hearing
in
every
sound
the
death
of
his
lady
andrey
vassilievitch
dreaming
i
fancy
that
he
had
been
caught
in
some
cage
out
of
which
he
would
never
again
escape
i
sick
almost
blind
with
headache
and
yet
exasperated
irritated
by
the
emptiness
of
it
all
if
only
we
might
run
down
that
hill
there
surely
we
should
find
at
the
very
moment
when
the
battery
had
finished
as
it
seemed
to
me
its
work
of
smashing
my
head
into
pulp
the
wagon
arrived
now
i
thought
to
myself
as
i
climbed
on
to
the
straw
i
shall
begin
to
be
excited
we
all
three
of
us
kneeling
on
the
cart
peered
forward
into
the
dim
blue
afternoon
we
were
very
silent
only
once
trenchard
said
to
me
perhaps
we
shall
find
her
down
here
where
we
going
what
do
you
think
durward
i
afraid
not
i
answered
but
still
she
be
all
right
semyonov
will
look
after
her
oh
semyonov
he
answered
how
joyful
we
were
to
leave
our
battery
behind
us
as
the
trees
closed
around
it
we
could
fancy
its
baffled
rage
other
batteries
now
seemed
to
draw
nearer
to
us
and
the
whole
forest
was
filled
with
childish
quarrelling
giants
but
as
we
began
to
bump
down
the
hill
out
of
the
forest
stranger
sounds
attacked
us
on
either
side
of
us
were
cornfields
and
out
of
the
heart
of
those
from
under
our
very
feet
as
it
seemed
there
were
explosions
of
a
strange
stinging
metallic
kind
not
angry
and
human
as
the
battery
had
been
but
rather
like
some
huge
bottle
cracking
in
the
sun
these
huge
bottles
one
could
fancy
them
green
and
shining
somewhere
in
the
corn
cracked
one
after
another
positively
the
sound
intensified
the
heat
of
the
sun
upon
one
head
there
were
too
now
for
the
first
time
in
our
experience
shrapnel
they
were
not
over
us
but
ran
somewhere
on
our
right
across
the
valley
their
sound
was
fireworks
and
nothing
more
so
that
alarm
at
their
gentle
holiday
temper
was
impossible
brock
fireworks
on
a
thursday
evening
at
the
crystal
palace
oneself
a
small
boy
sitting
with
both
hands
between
one
knees
one
mouth
open
a
damp
box
of
chocolates
on
one
lap
the
murmured
ah
of
the
happy
crowd
as
the
little
gentle
pop
showed
green
and
red
against
the
blue
night
sky
ah
there
was
the
little
pop
and
after
it
a
tiny
curling
cloud
of
smoke
in
the
air
the
whole
affair
so
gentle
so
kind
even
there
sighing
overhead
they
go
five
six
little
curls
of
smoke
and
then
beneath
our
very
horses
feet
again
a
huge
green
bottle
cracking
in
the
sun
and
with
all
this
noise
not
a
living
soul
to
be
seen
we
had
before
us
as
we
slowly
bumped
down
the
hill
a
fair
view
the
river
was
hidden
from
us
but
there
was
a
little
hamlet
guarded
happily
by
a
green
wood
there
was
a
line
of
fair
hills
fields
of
corn
and
the
long
dusty
white
road
not
a
soul
to
be
seen
only
our
bumping
cart
and
now
and
then
against
the
burning
sky
those
little
curling
circles
of
smoke
the
world
slumbered
suddenly
from
the
ditch
at
the
side
of
the
road
a
soldier
appeared
spoke
to
our
driver
and
disappeared
again
what
did
he
say
i
asked
he
says
your
honour
that
we
must
hasten
we
may
be
hit
hit
here
on
this
road
well
hurry
then
i
caught
a
little
frightened
sigh
behind
me
from
andrey
vassilievitch
whom
the
events
of
the
day
had
frozen
into
silence
we
hurried
bumping
along
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
there
was
a
farmhouse
from
behind
it
an
officer
appeared
what
are
you
doing
there
you
under
fire
red
cross
ah
yes
we
had
a
message
about
you
dr
semyonov
yes
please
come
this
way
hurry
please
we
were
led
across
the
farmyard
and
almost
tumbled
into
a
trench
at
the
farther
end
of
it
it
was
until
i
felt
some
one
touch
my
shoulder
that
i
realised
my
position
we
were
sitting
the
three
of
us
in
a
slanting
fashion
with
our
backs
to
the
earthworks
of
the
trench
to
our
right
under
an
improvised
round
roof
a
little
man
like
a
bee
with
his
tunic
open
at
the
neck
and
a
beard
of
some
days
on
his
chin
was
calling
down
a
telephone
next
to
me
on
the
left
a
smart
young
officer
of
a
perfect
neatness
and
even
dandiness
was
eating
his
supper
which
his
servant
crouching
in
front
of
him
ladled
with
a
spoon
out
of
a
tin
can
beyond
him
again
the
soldiers
in
a
long
line
under
the
farm
wall
were
sewing
their
clothes
eating
talking
in
whispers
and
one
of
them
reading
a
newspaper
aloud
to
himself
a
barn
opposite
us
in
ruins
showed
between
its
bare
posts
the
green
fields
beyond
now
and
then
a
soldier
would
move
across
the
yard
to
the
door
of
the
farm
and
he
seemed
to
slide
with
something
between
walking
and
running
his
shoulders
bent
his
head
down
the
sun
low
now
showed
just
above
the
end
of
the
farm
roof
and
the
lines
of
light
were
orange
between
the
shadows
of
the
barn
all
the
batteries
seemed
now
very
far
away
the
only
sound
in
the
world
was
the
occasional
sigh
of
the
shrapnel
the
farmyard
was
bathed
in
the
peace
of
the
summer
evening
the
colonel
when
he
had
finished
his
conversation
with
some
humorous
sally
that
gave
him
great
pleasure
greeted
us
very
glad
to
see
you
gentlemen
two
englishmen
well
that
the
alliance
in
very
truth
yes
how
london
gentlemen
yes
that
small
tin
the
grey
one
no
the
one
semyonov
sent
a
message
pray
make
yourselves
comfortable
but
do
raise
your
heads
they
may
turn
their
minds
in
this
direction
at
any
moment
again
we
had
them
once
already
this
afternoon
eh
piotr
ivanovitch
this
to
the
smart
young
officer
that
would
have
made
your
ekaterina
petrovna
jump
in
her
sleep
ha
ha
ha
oh
yes
but
i
can
see
her
jumping
hullo
telephone
give
it
here
that
you
ivan
leontievitch
no
very
well
for
the
moment
two
englishmen
here
sitting
in
my
trench
truth
itself
well
what
about
the
second
are
they
coming
down
i
do
know
what
do
you
say
the
young
officer
in
a
very
gentle
and
melodious
voice
offered
trenchard
who
was
sitting
next
to
him
some
supper
one
of
these
cutlets
trenchard
blushing
and
stammering
refused
a
cigarette
then
trenchard
again
refused
and
piotr
ivanovitch
having
done
his
duty
relapsed
into
his
muffled
elegance
we
sat
very
quietly
there
trenchard
staring
with
distressed
eyes
in
front
of
him
andrey
vassilievitch
very
uncomfortable
his
fat
body
sliding
forward
on
the
slant
pulling
itself
up
then
sliding
again
always
he
maintained
his
air
of
importance
giving
his
cough
twisting
the
ends
of
his
moustache
staring
fiercely
at
some
one
suddenly
that
he
might
disconcert
him
patting
with
his
plump
little
hands
his
clothes
the
shadows
lengthened
and
a
great
green
oak
that
hung
over
the
barn
seemed
as
the
evening
advanced
to
grow
larger
and
larger
and
to
absorb
into
its
heart
all
the
flaming
colours
of
the
day
to
press
them
into
its
dark
shadow
and
to
hide
them
safe
and
contented
until
another
morning
i
sat
there
and
gradually
caught
as
it
seemed
to
me
into
a
world
of
whispers
and
i
slipped
forward
a
little
down
into
the
dark
walls
of
the
trench
and
half
clung
still
to
the
buzzing
voice
of
the
colonel
the
languid
replies
of
the
young
officer
i
felt
then
that
some
one
was
whispering
to
me
that
my
real
adventure
was
about
to
begin
i
could
see
quite
plainly
like
a
road
up
which
i
had
gone
the
events
of
the
day
behind
me
i
saw
the
ride
under
the
stars
the
cold
red
dawn
marie
ivanovna
standing
beneath
my
cart
the
sudden
battery
and
the
desolate
hours
of
waiting
the
wounded
men
stumbling
out
of
the
forest
the
ride
down
the
hill
and
the
green
bottles
bursting
in
the
sun
the
sudden
silences
and
the
sudden
sounds
my
own
weariness
and
discomfort
and
loneliness
and
now
something
was
it
the
dark
green
oak
that
bent
down
and
hid
the
world
for
me
whispered
you
drawing
near
you
close
you
almost
there
in
a
moment
you
will
see
you
will
see
you
will
see
somewhere
the
soldiers
were
singing
and
then
all
sounds
ceased
we
were
standing
many
of
us
in
the
dark
the
great
oak
and
many
other
giant
trees
were
about
us
and
the
utter
silence
was
like
a
sudden
plunge
into
deep
water
on
a
hot
day
we
were
waiting
ready
for
the
creature
breathless
with
suspense
now
some
one
cried
and
instantly
there
was
such
a
roar
that
i
seemed
to
be
lifted
by
it
far
into
the
sky
held
rocked
then
dropped
gently
i
woke
to
find
myself
standing
up
in
the
trench
my
hands
to
my
ears
i
was
aware
first
that
the
sky
had
changed
from
blue
into
a
muddy
grey
then
that
dust
and
an
ugly
smell
were
in
my
eyes
my
mouth
my
nose
i
remembered
that
i
repeated
stupidly
again
and
again
what
what
what
then
the
grey
sky
slowly
fell
away
as
though
it
were
pushed
by
some
hand
and
i
saw
the
faint
evening
blue
with
so
strange
and
unreal
they
seemed
stars
i
caught
my
breath
and
realised
that
now
the
whole
right
corner
of
the
barn
was
gone
the
field
stretched
a
dark
shadow
to
the
edge
of
the
yard
in
the
ground
where
the
stakes
of
the
barn
had
been
there
was
a
deep
pit
scattered
were
bricks
pieces
of
wood
and
over
it
all
a
cloud
of
thin
fine
dust
that
hovered
and
swung
a
little
like
grey
silk
the
line
of
soldiers
was
crouched
back
into
the
trench
as
though
it
had
been
driven
by
some
force
from
as
it
appeared
a
great
distance
i
heard
the
colonel
voice
another
step
to
the
right
and
we
not
have
had
time
to
say
get
in
there
you
with
your
head
out
like
that
do
you
want
another
i
was
conscious
then
of
andrey
vassilievitch
sitting
huddled
on
the
ground
of
the
trench
his
head
tucked
into
his
chest
you
not
hurt
are
you
i
said
bending
down
to
him
he
got
up
and
to
my
surprise
seemed
quite
composed
he
was
rubbing
his
eyes
as
though
he
had
waked
from
sleep
not
at
all
he
answered
in
his
shrill
little
voice
no
what
a
noise
did
you
hear
it
ivan
andreievitch
did
i
hear
it
a
ridiculous
question
but
i
assure
you
i
was
not
alarmed
he
said
eagerly
turning
round
to
the
young
officer
who
was
rather
red
in
the
face
but
otherwise
unruffled
the
first
time
that
one
has
been
so
close
to
me
what
a
noise
trenchard
searched
in
his
pockets
for
something
what
is
it
i
asked
my
handkerchief
he
answered
so
dusty
after
that
it
in
my
eyes
he
tumbled
on
to
the
ground
a
large
clasp
a
hunk
of
black
bread
a
and
some
old
letters
i
had
one
he
muttered
anxiously
somewhere
i
know
i
heard
the
colonel
voice
again
no
one
touched
there
some
more
of
their
precious
ammunition
wasted
what
about
your
ekaterina
piotr
ivanovitch
ho
ho
ho
here
the
telephone
hullo
hullo
for
myself
i
had
the
irritation
that
one
might
feel
had
a
boy
thrown
a
stone
over
the
wall
broken
a
window
and
run
away
moreover
i
felt
that
again
i
had
missed
it
always
round
the
corner
always
just
out
of
sight
always
mocking
one
clumsy
pursuit
and
still
even
now
i
felt
no
excitement
no
curiosity
my
feet
had
not
yet
touched
the
enchanted
ground
the
trench
had
at
once
slipped
back
into
its
earlier
composure
the
dusk
was
now
creeping
down
the
hill
with
every
stir
of
the
breeze
more
stars
were
blown
into
the
sky
the
oak
was
all
black
now
like
a
friendly
shadow
protecting
me
there
be
no
more
for
a
while
said
the
colonel
he
was
right
there
was
stillness
no
battery
however
distant
no
of
rifle
fire
no
chattering
report
of
the
machine
guns
men
began
to
cross
the
yard
slowly
without
caution
the
dusk
caught
us
so
that
i
could
not
see
the
colonel
face
a
stream
that
cut
the
field
hidden
in
the
day
was
now
suddenly
revealed
by
a
grinning
careless
moon
then
a
soldier
crossed
the
yard
to
us
told
us
that
semyonov
wished
us
to
start
and
had
sent
us
a
guide
the
wagons
were
ready
at
that
instant
whence
i
know
not
for
the
first
time
that
day
excitement
leapt
upon
me
events
had
hitherto
passed
before
me
like
the
shadowed
film
of
a
cinematograph
it
had
been
as
though
some
one
had
given
me
glimpses
of
a
life
an
adventure
a
country
with
which
i
should
later
have
some
concern
but
whose
boundaries
i
was
not
yet
to
cross
now
suddenly
whether
it
was
because
of
the
dark
and
the
silence
i
can
not
say
i
had
become
myself
an
actor
in
the
affair
it
was
not
simply
that
we
were
given
something
definite
to
do
we
had
had
wounded
during
the
morning
it
was
rather
that
as
in
the
children
game
we
were
hot
we
had
drawn
in
a
moment
close
to
some
one
or
something
of
whose
presence
we
were
quite
distinctly
aware
as
we
walked
across
the
yard
into
the
long
low
field
speaking
in
whispers
watching
a
shaft
of
light
perhaps
some
distant
projector
that
trembled
in
pale
white
shadows
on
the
horizon
we
seemed
to
me
to
be
in
actual
truth
the
hunters
of
trenchard
dream
never
surely
before
had
i
known
the
world
so
silent
under
the
hedges
that
lined
the
field
there
were
soldiers
like
ghosts
our
own
wagons
with
the
sanitars
walking
beside
them
moved
across
the
ground
without
even
the
creak
of
a
wheel
semyonov
was
to
meet
us
in
an
hour
time
at
a
certain
crossroad
i
was
given
the
command
of
the
party
i
was
now
in
literal
truth
breathlessly
excited
my
heart
was
beating
in
my
breast
like
some
creature
who
makes
running
leaps
at
escape
my
tongue
was
dry
and
my
brain
hot
but
i
was
happy
happy
with
a
strange
exaltation
that
was
unlike
any
emotion
that
i
had
known
before
it
was
in
part
the
happiness
that
i
had
known
sometimes
in
rugby
football
or
in
tennis
when
the
players
were
evenly
matched
and
the
game
hard
but
it
was
more
than
that
it
had
in
it
something
of
the
happiness
that
i
have
known
after
many
days
at
sea
on
the
first
view
of
land
but
it
was
more
than
that
something
of
the
happiness
of
possessing
at
last
some
object
which
one
has
many
days
desired
and
never
hoped
to
attain
but
more
too
than
that
something
of
the
happiness
of
danger
or
pain
that
one
has
dreaded
and
finds
in
actual
truth
give
way
before
one
resolution
but
more
again
than
that
this
happiness
this
exultation
that
i
felt
now
but
dimly
and
was
to
know
more
fully
afterwards
but
never
alas
as
my
companions
were
to
know
it
is
the
subject
of
this
book
the
scent
of
it
the
full
revelation
of
it
has
not
until
now
been
my
reward
i
can
only
as
a
spectator
watch
that
revelation
as
it
came
afterwards
to
others
more
fortunate
than
i
but
what
i
write
is
the
truth
as
far
as
i
from
the
outside
have
seen
it
if
it
is
not
true
this
book
has
no
value
whatever
we
were
warned
by
the
soldier
who
guarded
us
not
to
walk
in
a
group
and
we
stole
now
beneath
a
white
under
the
moon
in
a
long
line
i
could
hear
trenchard
behind
me
stumbling
over
the
stones
and
ruts
walking
as
he
always
did
with
little
jerks
as
though
his
legs
were
beyond
his
control
we
came
then
on
to
the
high
road
which
was
so
white
and
clear
in
the
moonlight
that
it
seemed
as
though
the
whole
austrian
army
must
instantly
whisper
to
themselves
ah
there
they
are
and
fire
the
ditch
to
our
right
as
far
as
i
could
see
was
lined
with
soldiers
hidden
by
the
hedge
behind
them
their
rifles
just
pointing
on
to
the
white
surface
of
the
land
our
guide
asked
them
their
division
and
was
answered
in
a
whisper
the
soldiers
were
ghosts
there
was
no
one
save
ourselves
alive
in
the
whole
world
then
a
little
incident
occurred
i
was
walking
in
the
rear
of
our
wagons
that
i
might
see
that
all
were
there
i
felt
a
touch
on
my
arm
and
found
andrey
vassilievitch
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
his
face
staring
at
me
as
though
i
were
a
stranger
expressed
desperate
determination
come
on
i
said
we
no
time
to
waste
i
not
coming
he
whispered
back
his
voice
was
breathless
as
though
he
had
been
running
nonsense
i
answered
roughly
and
i
put
my
hand
on
his
arm
his
body
trembled
in
jerks
and
starts
it
madness
this
road
the
moon
of
course
fire
we
all
be
killed
but
it
is
it
is
i
move
you
move
come
andrey
vassilievitch

been
brave
enough
all
day
there
no
danger
i
tell
you
see
how
quiet
everything
is
you
i
ca
it
nothing
nothing
to
do
with
me
it
awful
all
day
and
now
this
i
thought
of
marie
ivanovna
early
in
the
morning
i
looked
down
the
road
and
saw
that
the
wagons
were
slowly
moving
into
the
distant
shadows
you
come
i
repeated
we
ca
leave
you
here
do
think
of
yourself
and
nothing
can
touch
you

tell
you
i
go
back

must
i
ca
go
on

back
how
can

to

back
to
the
trench

sha
know
where
to
find
you
a
furious
anger
seized
me
i
caught
his
arm
i
leave
you
if
you
like
there
are
other
things
more
important
i
move
away
from
him
he
looked
down
the
long
road
looked
back
oh
i
ca
i
ca
he
repeated
what
did
you
come
for
i
whispered
furiously
what
did
you
think
war
was
well
do
as
you
please
as
i
drew
away
i
saw
a
look
of
desperate
determination
in
his
eyes
he
looked
at
me
like
a
dog
who
expects
to
be
beaten
then
what
must
have
been
one
of
the
supreme
moments
of
his
life
came
to
him
i
saw
him
struggle
to
command
with
the
effort
of
his
whole
soul
his
terror
for
a
moment
he
wavered
he
made
a
hopeless
gesture
with
his
hand
took
two
little
steps
as
though
he
would
run
into
the
hedge
amongst
the
soldiers
and
hide
there
then
suddenly
walked
past
me
quickly
towards
the
wagons
with
his
own
absurd
little
strut
with
his
head
up
giving
his
cough
looking
after
that
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
in
silence
we
caught
up
the
wagons
soon
at
some
they
came
to
a
pause
the
guide
was
waiting
for
me
it
would
be
better
your
honour
he
whispered
for
the
wagons
to
stay
here
we
shall
go
now
simply
with
the
stretchers
we
left
the
wagons
and
some
fifteen
of
us
turned
off
down
a
lane
to
the
left
sometimes
there
were
soldiers
in
the
hedges
sometimes
they
met
us
slipping
from
shadow
to
shadow
always
we
asked
whether
they
knew
of
any
wounded
we
found
a
wounded
soldier
groaning
under
the
hedge
one
leg
was
soaked
in
blood
and
he
gave
little
shrill
desperate
cries
as
we
lifted
him
on
to
the
stretcher
another
soldier
lying
on
the
road
in
the
moonlight
murmured
incessantly
moi
bojé
moi
bojé
moi
but
they
were
all
ghosts
we
alone
in
that
familiar
and
yet
so
unreal
world
were
alive
when
a
stretcher
was
filled
four
sanitars
turned
back
with
it
to
the
wagons
and
we
were
soon
a
very
small
party
we
arrived
at
a
church
a
large
fantastic
white
church
with
a
green
turret
that
i
had
seen
from
the
opposite
hill
in
the
morning
then
it
had
seemed
small
and
very
remote
i
had
been
told
that
much
firing
had
been
centring
round
it
and
it
seemed
now
for
me
very
strange
that
we
should
be
standing
under
its
very
shadow
its
outline
so
quiet
and
grave
under
the
moon
with
its
churchyard
a
little
orchard
behind
it
and
a
garden
scenting
the
night
air
close
at
hand
here
in
the
graveyard
there
was
a
group
of
wounded
soldiers
in
their
eyes
that
look
of
faithful
expectation
of
certain
relief
our
stretchers
were
soon
full
we
were
about
to
turn
back
when
suddenly
the
road
behind
us
was
filled
with
shadows
as
we
came
out
of
the
churchyard
an
officer
stepped
forward
to
meet
us
we
saluted
and
shook
hands
he
seemed
a
boy
but
stood
in
front
of
his
men
with
an
air
as
though
he
commanded
the
whole
of
this
world
of
ghosts
what
are
you
doing
here
he
asked
we
explained
well
if
you
excuse
me
you
better
make
haste
an
attack
very
shortly
yes
i
should
advise
you
to
be
out
of
this
petrogradsky
otriad
yes
very
glad
to
have
the
pleasure
we
left
him
his
men
a
grey
cloud
behind
him
and
when
we
had
taken
a
few
steps
he
seemed
with
his
young
air
of
importance
his
happy
serious
courtesy
to
have
been
called
out
of
the
ground
then
with
all
his
shadows
behind
him
to
have
been
caught
up
into
the
air
these
were
not
figures
that
had
anything
to
do
with
the
little
curling
wreaths
of
smoke
the
bottles
cracking
in
the
sun
our
furious
giants
of
the
morning
ah
moi
bojé
sighed
the
wounded
it
was
impossible
in
such
a
world
of
dim
shadow
that
there
should
ever
be
any
other
sound
again
my
excitement
had
never
left
me
i
had
had
no
doubt
during
this
last
that
i
was
on
the
enchanted
ground
of
the
enemy
so
stray
and
figurative
had
been
my
impressions
all
day
now
they
were
all
gathered
into
this
and
the
whole
affair
received
its
climax
ah
i
thought
to
myself
if
i
might
only
stay
here
now
i
should
draw
closer
and
closer
i
should
make
my
discovery
hunt
him
down
but
just
when
i
am
on
the
verge
i
must
leave
it
all
ah
if
i
could
but
stay
nevertheless
we
hastened
the
world
in
spite
of
the
ghosts
was
real
enough
for
us
to
be
conscious
of
that
attack
looming
behind
us
we
found
our
wagons
transferred
our
wounded
then
hurried
down
the
road
we
found
the
and
there
waiting
for
us
semyonov
and
marie
ivanovna
standing
in
the
moonlight
commanding
as
it
seemed
to
me
all
of
us
even
semyonov
she
was
a
very
different
figure
from
the
frightened
girl
of
the
early
morning
now
her
life
was
in
her
eyes
her
body
inflamed
with
the
fire
of
the
things
that
had
come
to
her
so
young
in
experience
was
she
so
ignorant
of
all
earlier
adventure
that
she
could
well
be
seized
utterly
and
completely
by
her
new
vision
possessed
by
some
vision
she
was
and
that
vision
was
not
trenchard
seeing
her
he
hurried
towards
her
with
a
glad
cry
ah
you
are
safe
but
she
did
not
notice
him
quick
this
way
yes
the
stretchers
here
no
i
have
everything
at
once
there
is
little
time
the
wounded
were
laid
on
the
stretchers
in
the
square
of
the
semyonov
and
marie
ivanovna
bandaged
them
under
the
moonlight
and
with
the
aid
of
on
every
side
of
me
there
were
little
dialogues
no
not
there
more
this
way
yes
that
bandage
will
do
it
fresh
hold
up
his
leg
no
under
the
knee
there
where
the
lint
turn
him
a
little
there
like
that
no
turn
it
back
over
the
thigh
now
once
more
that
it
what
that
bullet
or
shrapnel
take
it
back
again
over
the
shoulder
yes
twice
once
i
caught
sight
of
trenchard
hurrying
to
be
useful
with
the
little
bottle
of
iodine
stumbling
over
one
of
the
stretchers
causing
the
wounded
man
to
cry
out
then
semyonov
voice
angrily
tchort
who
that
ah
meester
of
course
then
marie
ivanovna
voice
i
finished
this
alexei
petrovitch
that
all
is
it
these
voices
were
all
whispers
floating
from
one
side
of
the
road
to
the
other
the
wounded
men
were
lifted
back
on
to
the
wagons
we
moved
off
again
semyonov
trenchard
marie
ivanovna
and
i
were
now
sitting
together
we
left
the
flat
fields
where
we
had
been
so
busy
very
slowly
we
began
to
climb
the
hill
down
which
i
had
come
this
afternoon
behind
me
was
a
great
fan
of
country
black
now
under
a
hidden
moon
dead
as
though
our
retreat
from
it
depriving
it
of
the
last
proofs
of
life
had
flung
it
back
into
before
us
was
the
black
forest
not
a
sound
save
the
roll
of
our
wheels
and
sometimes
a
cry
from
one
of
the
wounded
soldiers
not
a
stir
of
wind
i
looked
back
without
an
instant
warning
that
dead
world
as
a
match
is
set
to
a
waiting
bonfire
broke
into
flame
a
thousand
rockets
rose
soaring
in
streams
of
light
into
the
dark
sky
the
fields
that
had
been
vapour
ran
now
with
light
a
huge
projector
the
eye
as
it
seemed
to
me
of
that
enemy
for
whom
i
had
all
day
been
searching
slowly
wheeled
across
the
world
cutting
a
great
path
across
the
plain
picking
houses
and
trees
and
fields
out
of
space
then
dropping
them
back
again
the
rockets
were
gold
and
green
sometimes
as
it
seemed
ringed
with
fire
sometimes
cold
like
dead
moons
sometimes
sparkling
and
quivering
like
great
stars
and
with
this
light
the
whole
world
crackled
into
sound
as
though
the
sky
a
vast
china
plate
had
been
smashed
by
some
angry
god
and
been
flung
in
a
million
pieces
to
earth
the
rose
from
horizon
to
horizon
like
a
living
thing
now
the
shrapnel
rose
breaking
on
the
dark
sky
in
flashes
of
fire
suddenly
some
house
was
burning
the
flames
rose
in
a
column
breaking
into
tongues
that
advanced
and
retreated
climbed
and
fell
again
in
the
farthest
distance
other
houses
had
caught
and
their
glow
trembled
in
faint
yellow
light
fading
into
shadow
when
the
projector
found
them
with
a
roar
at
our
back
our
own
cannon
began
the
world
bellowed
and
shook
and
trembled
at
our
feet
we
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
i
caught
one
final
vision
the
picture
seeming
to
sway
with
all
its
lights
its
shadows
its
giant
eye
that
governed
it
its
colours
and
its
mist
like
a
tapestry
blown
by
wind
i
saw
in
our
wagon
their
faces
lighted
by
the
fire
semyonov
and
marie
ivanovna
semyonov
knelt
on
the
wooden
barrier
of
the
cart
his
figure
outlined
square
and
strong
she
was
kneeling
behind
him
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
her
face
was
exultant
victorious
she
seemed
to
me
the
inspirer
of
that
scene
to
have
created
it
to
hold
it
now
with
the
authority
of
her
gaze
behind
her
trenchard
was
in
shadow
we
were
on
the
the
cannon
as
it
seemed
on
every
side
of
us
we
hung
for
a
moment
so
the
sky
flaming
up
to
our
feet
then
we
had
fallen
down
between
the
woods
every
step
muffling
the
sounds
everything
was
dark
as
though
a
curtain
had
been
dropped
semyonov
turned
round
to
me
well
he
said
there
your
battle
you
been
in
the
thick
of
it
i
saw
his
eyes
turned
to
marie
ivanovna
as
though
already
he
possessed
her
i
was
suddenly
tired
disappointed
exhausted
we
not
been
in
the
thick
of
it
i
answered
we
have
missed
it
all
day
we
have
missed
it
i
tried
to
settle
down
in
my
wagon
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
irritably
to
trenchard
but
your
boot
is
in
my
neck
chapter
iv
nikitin
but
this
is
not
my
story
if
i
have
hitherto
taken
the
chief
place
it
is
because
in
some
degree
the
impressions
of
trenchard
marie
ivanovna
andrey
vassilievitch
must
during
those
first
days
have
run
with
my
own
we
had
all
been
brought
to
the
same
point
that
last
vision
from
the
hill
of
the
battle
of
s
and
from
that
day
we
were
no
longer
apprentices
i
now
then
retire
what
happened
to
myself
during
the
succeeding
months
is
of
no
matter
but
two
warnings
may
be
offered
the
first
is
that
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
experiences
of
myself
of
trenchard
of
nikitin
in
this
business
found
their
parallel
in
any
other
single
human
being
alive
it
would
be
quite
possible
to
select
every
individual
member
of
our
otriad
and
to
prove
from
their
case
that
the
effect
of
war
upon
the
human
soul
whether
russian
or
english
was
thus
and
thus
a
study
for
example
might
be
made
of
anna
petrovna
to
show
that
the
effect
of
war
is
simply
nothing
at
all
that
any
one
who
pretends
to
extract
cases
and
contrasts
from
the
contact
of
war
with
the
soul
is
simply
peddling
in
melodrama
anna
petrovna
herself
would
certainly
have
been
of
that
opinion
or
one
might
select
sister
k
and
prove
from
her
case
that
the
effect
of
war
was
to
display
the
earthly
failings
and
wickedness
of
mankind
that
it
was
a
punishment
hurled
by
an
irate
god
upon
an
unrepentant
people
and
that
any
one
who
saw
beauty
or
courage
in
such
a
business
was
a
sham
sentimentalist
sister
k
would
take
a
gloomy
joy
in
such
a
denunciation
or
if
one
selected
the
boy
goga
it
would
be
simply
to
state
that
war
was
an
immensely
jolly
business
in
which
one
stood
the
chance
of
winning
the
georgian
medal
and
thus
triumphing
over
one
schoolfellows
in
which
people
were
certainly
killed
but
it
could
happen
to
oneself
meals
were
plentiful
there
were
horses
to
ride
one
was
spoken
to
pleasantly
by
captains
and
even
generals
moreover
one
wore
a
uniform
or
if
molozov
our
chief
were
questioned
he
would
most
certainly
say
that
war
as
he
saw
it
was
mainly
a
business
of
diplomacy
a
business
of
keeping
the
people
around
one
in
good
temper
the
soldiers
in
good
order
the
generals
and
their
staffs
in
good
appetite
the
other
red
cross
organisations
in
good
and
himself
in
good
health
all
these
things
he
did
most
admirably
and
he
had
moreover
a
heart
that
felt
as
deeply
for
russia
as
any
heart
in
the
world
but
see
the
matter
psychologically
or
even
dramatically
he
would
not
he
had
his
own
nerves
and
on
occasion
he
displayed
them
but
war
was
for
him
entirely
a
thing
of
training
opposed
to
training
strategy
opposed
to
strategy
method
and
system
opposed
to
method
and
system
for
our
doctors
again
war
was
half
an
affair
of
blood
and
bones
half
an
affair
of
longing
for
home
and
children
the
army
doctors
contemplated
our
voluntary
efforts
with
a
certain
irony
what
could
we
understand
of
war
when
we
might
if
we
pleased
return
home
at
any
moment
why
it
was
simply
a
picnic
to
us
no
they
saw
in
it
no
drama
whatever
nevertheless
how
are
we
to
be
assured
that
these
others
anna
petrovna
sister
k
goga
the
doctors
had
not
their
own
secret
view
the
subject
here
is
simply
the
attitude
of
certain
private
persons
with
whom
i
was
allowed
some
intimacy
for
the
rest
one
has
no
right
to
speak
there
comes
then
the
second
difficulty
namely
that
of
nikitin
andrey
vassilievitch
semyonov
and
marie
ivanovna
one
can
only
present
a
foreign
point
of
view
of
nikitin
and
andrey
vassilievitch
at
least
i
was
the
friend
but
however
deeply
a
russian
admits
an
englishman
into
friendship
he
can
to
the
very
last
puzzle
confuse
utterly
surprise
him
the
russian
character
seems
superficially
with
its
lack
of
restraint
its
idealism
its
impracticality
its
mysticism
its
material
simplicities
to
be
so
readily
grasped
that
the
surprise
that
finally
remains
is
the
more
dumbfounding
perhaps
after
all
it
is
the
very
closeness
of
our
resemblance
the
one
to
the
other
that
confuses
us
it
is
perhaps
that
in
the
russians
soul
the
east
can
never
be
reconciled
to
the
west
it
is
perhaps
that
the
russian
never
reveals
his
secret
ideal
even
to
himself
far
distant
is
it
then
from
his
friend
it
may
be
that
towards
other
men
the
russian
is
indifferent
and
towards
women
his
relation
is
so
completely
sexual
that
his
true
character
is
hidden
from
her
whatever
it
be
that
surprise
remains
for
to
those
whom
russia
and
her
people
draw
back
again
and
again
however
sternly
they
may
resist
this
sure
truth
stands
that
here
there
is
a
mystery
a
mystery
that
may
never
be
discovered
in
the
very
soul
of
russia
the
mystery
is
stirring
here
the
restlessness
the
eagerness
the
disappointment
the
vision
of
the
pursuit
is
working
and
some
who
are
outside
her
gates
she
has
drawn
into
that
same
search
i
am
not
sure
whether
i
may
speak
of
nikitin
as
my
friend
i
believe
that
no
one
in
our
otriad
save
trenchard
could
make
with
truth
this
claim
but
for
his
own
reasons
or
perhaps
for
no
reason
at
all
he
chose
me
on
two
occasions
as
his
confidant
and
of
these
two
occasions
i
can
recall
every
detail
we
returned
that
night
from
s
to
find
that
the
whole
otriad
had
settled
in
the
village
of
m
where
i
myself
had
been
the
night
before
we
were
all
living
in
an
empty
deserted
farmhouse
with
a
yard
a
big
orchard
wide
barns
and
a
wild
overrun
garden
we
were
i
think
a
little
disappointed
at
the
very
languid
interest
that
the
history
of
our
adventures
roused
but
the
truth
was
that
the
wounded
had
begun
to
arrive
in
great
numbers
and
there
was
no
time
for
travellers
stories
a
dream
i
know
yesterday
experiences
seemed
to
me
as
i
settled
down
to
the
business
that
had
filled
so
much
of
my
earlier
period
at
the
war
here
with
the
wounded
i
was
at
home
the
bare
little
room
the
table
with
the
bottles
and
bandages
and
scissors
the
basins
and
dishes
the
air
ever
thicker
and
thicker
with
that
smell
of
dried
blood
unwashed
bodies
and
iodine
that
is
like
no
other
smell
in
the
world
the
room
would
be
crowded
the
sanitars
supporting
legs
and
arms
and
heads
nurses
dashing
to
the
table
for
bandages
or
iodine
or
scissors
three
or
four
stretchers
occupying
the
floor
of
the
room
with
the
soldiers
who
were
too
severely
wounded
to
sit
or
stand
these
soldiers
often
utterly
quiet
dying
perhaps
or
watching
with
eyes
that
realised
only
dreams
and
shadows
the
little
window
square
the
strip
of
sky
the
changing
colours
of
the
day
then
the
sitting
soldiers
on
ordinary
of
a
marvellous
and
most
simple
patience
watching
the
bandaging
of
their
arms
and
hands
and
legs
whispering
sometimes
moi
bojé
moi
dragging
themselves
up
from
their
desperate
struggle
for
endurance
to
answer
the
sanitars
who
asked
their
name
their
regiments
the
nature
of
their
wounds
sometimes
they
would
talk
telling
how
the
thing
had
happened
to
them
and
there
your
honour
before
i
could
move
she
had
come
such
a
noise
eh
eh
a
terrible
thing
i
called
out
here
it
is
i
said
and
he
but
as
a
rule
they
were
very
quiet
starting
perhaps
at
the
sting
of
the
iodine
asking
for
a
bandage
to
be
tighter
or
not
so
tight
sometimes
suddenly
slipping
in
a
faint
to
the
ground
and
then
apologising
afterwards
and
in
their
eyes
always
that
look
as
though
very
shortly
they
would
hear
some
story
so
marvellous
that
it
would
compensate
for
all
their
present
pain
and
distress
there
would
be
the
doctors
generally
two
at
a
time
semyonov
unmoved
rough
apparently
in
his
handling
of
the
men
but
always
accomplishing
his
work
with
marvellous
efficiency
abusing
the
nurses
and
sanitars
without
hesitation
if
they
did
not
do
as
he
wished
but
never
raising
his
soft
ironic
voice
his
square
body
of
a
solidity
and
composure
that
nothing
could
ruffle
his
fair
beard
his
blue
eyes
his
spotless
linen
all
sharing
in
his
superiority
to
us
all
one
of
the
division
doctors
alexei
ivanovitch
a
man
from
little
russia
beloved
of
us
all
whether
in
the
otriad
or
the
army
a
character
possessing
it
seemed
none
of
the
russian
moods
and
sensibilities
of
the
kindest
heart
but
no
sentimentality
utterly
free
from
humorous
loving
passionately
his
country
and
with
all
his
russian
romance
and
even
mysticism
packed
with
practical
common
sense
another
division
doctor
a
young
man
carving
for
himself
a
practice
out
of
moscow
merchants
crammed
with
all
the
latest
inventions
and
discoveries
caring
for
nothing
save
his
own
career
and
frankly
saying
so
but
a
lively
optimist
whose
belief
in
his
own
powers
was
quite
refreshing
in
its
sincerity
in
such
a
place
and
under
such
conditions
semyonov
had
at
the
earlier
period
been
master
of
us
all
the
effect
of
his
personality
was
such
that
we
had
every
one
of
us
believed
him
invincible
the
very
frankness
of
his
estimate
of
the
world
and
ourselves
as
the
most
worthless
and
incompetent
bundle
of
rubbish
caused
us
to
yield
completely
to
him
we
believed
that
he
rated
himself
but
little
higher
than
the
rest
of
us
he
superior
but
only
because
he
saw
so
clearly
with
eyes
purged
of
sentiment
and
credulity
we
poor
creatures
had
still
our
moments
of
faith
and
confidence
i
had
never
liked
him
and
during
these
last
days
had
positively
hated
him
i
did
not
doubt
that
he
was
making
the
frankest
love
to
marie
ivanovna
and
i
thought
he
was
influencing
her
trenchard
was
my
friend
and
what
an
infant
indeed
he
seemed
against
semyonov
scornful
challenge
but
now
behold
semyonov
had
his
rival
if
semyonov
cared
nothing
for
any
of
us
nikitin
it
was
plain
enough
cared
nothing
for
semyonov
from
the
very
first
the
two
men
had
been
opponents
it
seemed
as
though
nikitin
great
stature
and
fine
air
as
of
a
king
travelling
in
disguise
from
some
foreign
country
made
him
the
only
man
in
the
world
to
put
out
semyonov
sinister
blaze
nikitin
was
an
idealist
a
mystic
a
dreamer
everything
that
semyonov
was
not
it
is
true
that
if
we
mattered
nothing
at
all
to
semyonov
we
also
mattered
nothing
at
all
to
nikitin
but
for
nikitin
there
were
dreams
visions
memories
and
hopes
we
were
contented
to
be
banished
from
his
attention
when
we
were
aware
that
happier
objects
detained
him
we
might
envy
him
we
could
not
dislike
him
semyonov
never
sneered
at
nikitin
from
the
first
he
left
him
absolutely
alone
the
two
men
simply
avoided
one
another
in
so
far
as
was
possible
in
a
company
so
closely
confined
as
ours
from
the
first
they
treated
one
another
with
a
high
and
almost
extravagant
politeness
as
nikitin
spoke
but
seldom
there
was
little
opportunity
for
the
manifestation
of
what
semyonov
must
have
considered
his
childishly
romantic
mind
and
nikitin
on
his
side
made
on
no
single
occasion
a
reply
to
the
challenge
of
semyonov
caustic
cynicism
but
if
nikitin
was
an
idealist
he
was
also
as
was
quite
evident
a
doctor
of
absolutely
ability
and
efficiency
i
was
present
at
the
first
operation
that
he
conducted
with
us
an
easy
amputation
semyonov
was
assisting
and
i
know
that
he
watched
eagerly
for
some
slip
or
hesitation
it
was
an
operation
that
any
medical
student
might
have
conducted
with
success
but
the
first
incision
of
the
knife
showed
nikitin
a
surgeon
of
genius
semyonov
recognised
it
i
fancied
that
from
that
moment
i
could
detect
in
his
attitude
to
nikitin
a
puzzled
wonder
that
such
an
artist
could
be
at
the
same
time
such
a
fool
i
began
to
feel
in
nikitin
a
very
lively
interest
i
had
from
the
first
been
conscious
of
his
presence
his
distinction
his
attitude
of
patient
expectation
and
continuously
happy
reminiscence
but
i
felt
now
for
the
first
time
a
closer
more
personal
interest
from
the
first
as
i
have
said
on
an
earlier
page
his
relationship
to
andrey
vassilievitch
had
puzzled
me
if
nikitin
were
not
of
the
common
race
of
men
most
assuredly
was
andrey
vassilievitch
of
the
most
ordinary
in
the
world
he
was
a
little
man
of
a
type
in
no
way
distinctively
russian
a
type
very
common
in
england
in
america
in
france
in
germany
he
was
one
would
have
said
of
the
world
worldly
a
man
who
with
a
sharp
business
brain
had
acquired
for
himself
houses
lands
food
servants
acquaintances
upon
these
achievements
he
would
pride
himself
having
worked
with
his
own
hand
to
his
own
advantage
having
beaten
other
men
who
had
started
the
race
from
the
same
mark
as
himself
he
would
be
a
man
of
a
kindly
disposition
hospitable
generous
at
times
when
needs
were
put
plainly
before
him
but
yet
of
little
imagination
conventional
in
all
his
standards
readily
influenced
outside
his
business
by
any
chance
acquaintance
but
nevertheless
having
his
eye
on
worldly
advantage
and
progress
he
would
be
timid
of
soul
playing
always
for
safety
taking
the
easiest
way
with
all
emotion
treading
always
the
known
road
accepting
day
by
day
the
creed
that
was
given
to
him
he
would
be
outside
his
brain
of
a
poor
intelligence
accepting
the
things
of
art
on
the
standard
of
popular
applause
talking
with
a
stupid
garrulity
about
matters
of
which
he
had
no
knowledge
proud
of
his
position
as
a
man
of
the
world
wise
in
the
character
and
moods
of
men
of
which
in
reality
he
knew
nothing
had
he
been
an
englishman
or
a
german
this
would
have
been
all
and
yet
because
he
was
a
russian
this
was
not
even
the
beginning
of
the
matter
i
had
as
i
have
already
said
in
earlier
days
known
him
only
slightly
i
had
once
stayed
for
three
days
in
his
and
it
was
here
that
i
had
met
his
wife
russian
houses
are
open
to
all
the
world
and
with
such
a
man
as
andrey
vassilievitch
through
the
doors
crowds
of
men
and
women
are
always
coming
and
going
treating
their
host
like
the
platform
of
a
railway
station
eating
his
meals
sleeping
on
his
beds
making
rendezvous
with
their
friends
and
yet
almost
on
their
departure
forgetting
his
very
name
my
visit
had
been
of
a
date
now
some
five
years
old
i
can
only
remember
that
his
wife
did
not
make
any
very
definite
impression
upon
me
a
little
quiet
woman
of
a
short
figure
with
kind
rather
sleepy
eyes
a
soft
voice
and
the
air
of
one
who
knows
her
housewifely
business
to
perfection
and
has
joy
in
her
knowledge
not
interesting
i
would
have
judged
her
but
i
had
during
my
stay
no
personal
talk
with
her
it
was
only
after
my
visit
that
i
was
told
that
this
quiet
woman
was
the
passion
of
andrey
vassilievitch
life
he
had
been
over
thirty
when
he
had
married
her
she
had
been
married
before
had
been
treated
i
was
informed
with
great
brutality
by
her
husband
who
had
left
her
she
had
then
divorced
him
praise
of
her
i
discovered
was
universal
she
was
apparently
a
woman
who
created
love
in
others
but
this
by
no
marked
virtues
or
cleverness
no
one
said
of
her
that
she
was
brilliant
charming
fascinating
people
spoke
of
her
as
though
here
at
least
there
was
some
one
of
whom
they
were
sure
some
one
too
who
made
them
the
characters
they
wished
to
be
some
one
finally
who
had
not
surrendered
herself
who
gave
them
her
love
but
not
her
whole
soul
keeping
always
mystery
enough
to
maintain
her
independence
no
scandal
was
connected
with
her
name
i
heard
of
nikitin
and
others
as
her
friends
and
that
was
all
then
quite
suddenly
two
months
before
the
beginning
of
the
war
she
died
they
said
that
andrey
vassilievitch
was
like
a
lost
dog
wished
also
at
first
to
talk
to
all
who
had
known
her
wearying
her
friends
with
his
reminiscences
his
laments
his
complaints
then
suddenly
silent
speaking
to
no
one
about
her
at
first
burying
himself
in
his
business
then
working
on
some
committee
in
connexion
with
one
of
the
hospitals
then
as
it
appeared
on
the
impulse
of
a
moment
departing
to
the
war
i
had
expected
to
find
him
a
changed
man
and
was
perhaps
disappointed
that
he
should
appear
the
same
chattering
little
character
whom
i
had
known
of
old
nevertheless
i
knew
well
enough
that
there
was
more
here
than
i
could
see
and
that
the
root
of
the
matter
was
to
be
found
in
his
connexion
with
nikitin
in
our
otriad
friendships
were
continually
springing
up
and
dying
down
some
one
would
confide
to
one
that
was
wonderfully
sympathetic
from
the
other
side
one
would
hear
the
same
for
some
days
these
friends
would
be
undivided
would
search
out
from
the
otriad
the
others
who
were
of
their
mind
would
lose
no
opportunity
of
declaring
their
sympathy
would
sit
together
at
table
work
together
over
the
bandaging
unite
together
in
the
public
discussions
that
were
frequent
and
to
a
stranger
eye
horribly
heated
then
very
soon
there
would
come
a
rift
how
could
that
russian
passionate
longing
for
justified
idealism
be
realised
once
more
there
were
faults
spots
on
the
sun
selfishness
bad
temper
narrowness
what
you
please
and
at
every
fresh
disappointment
would
my
companions
be
as
surprised
as
though
the
same
thing
had
not
happened
to
them
only
a
fortnight
ago
but
only
last
week
you
liked
him
so
much
how
could
i
know
that
he
would
hold
such
opinions
never
in
my
life
have
i
been
more
surprised
so
upon
these
little
billows
sailed
the
stout
bark
of
russian
idealism
rising
falling
never
overwhelmed
always
bravely
confident
never
seeking
for
calm
waters
refusing
them
indeed
for
their
very
placidity
but
in
the
midst
of
these
shifting
fortunes
there
were
certain
alliances
and
relationships
that
never
changed
amongst
these
was
the
alliance
of
nikitin
and
andrey
vassilievitch
friendship
it
could
not
be
called
nikitin
although
apparently
he
was
kindly
to
the
little
man
yielded
him
no
intimacy
it
seemed
to
us
a
very
business
depending
partly
upon
andrey
vassilievitch
continual
assertions
that
nikitin
was
his
oldest
friend
and
the
closest
friend
of
his
wife
that
nikitin
was
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
in
the
world
that
only
his
intimate
friends
could
know
how
remarkable
he
was
partly
too
upon
the
capacity
of
andrey
vassilievitch
to
fetch
and
carry
for
his
friend
to
put
himself
indeed
to
the
greatest
inconvenience
it
was
pathetic
to
see
the
flaming
pleasure
in
the
man
eyes
when
nikitin
permitted
him
to
wait
upon
him
and
how
ironically
upon
such
an
occasion
would
semyonov
watch
them
both
in
spite
of
nikitin
passivity
he
did
i
fancied
more
than
merely
suffer
this
unequal
alliance
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
behind
his
silence
some
active
wish
that
the
affair
should
continue
i
should
speak
too
strongly
if
i
were
to
say
that
he
took
pleasure
in
the
company
but
he
did
i
believe
almost
in
spite
of
himself
secretly
encourage
it
and
there
was
in
spite
of
the
comedy
that
persistently
hovered
about
his
figure
and
habits
some
fine
spirit
in
andrey
vassilievitch
championship
of
his
hero
how
he
hated
semyonov
how
he
lost
no
single
opportunity
of
trying
to
bring
nikitin
forward
in
public
of
proving
to
the
world
who
was
the
greater
of
the
two
men
something
very
shone
through
the
colour
of
his
loyalty
nothing
i
was
convinced
could
swerve
him
from
his
fidelity
that
at
least
was
until
death
there
arose
then
in
these
days
of
the
wounded
at
m
a
strange
relationship
between
myself
and
nikitin
friendship
i
have
said
i
may
not
call
it
nikitin
afterwards
told
me
it
was
my
interest
in
the
study
of
human
character
that
led
to
his
frankness
as
though
he
had
said
here
is
a
man
who
likes
to
play
a
certain
game
i
also
enjoy
it
we
will
play
it
together
but
when
the
game
is
finished
we
separate
although
discussions
as
to
the
characters
of
one
or
another
of
us
were
continuous
and
to
an
englishman
at
any
rate
most
strangely
public
i
do
not
think
that
the
russians
in
our
otriad
were
really
interested
in
human
psychology
one
criticised
or
praised
in
order
to
justify
some
personal
disappointment
or
pleasure
there
was
nothing
that
gave
our
company
greater
pleasure
than
to
declare
in
full
voice
that
was
a
dear
most
sympathetic
a
fine
man
public
praise
was
continuous
and
the
most
honest
and
spontaneous
affair
if
criticism
sometimes
followed
with
surprising
quickness
that
was
spontaneous
too
all
the
emotions
in
our
otriad
were
spontaneous
to
the
very
extreme
of
spontaneity
but
we
were
not
real
students
of
one
another
we
were
content
to
call
things
by
their
names
to
call
silence
silence
obstinacy
obstinacy
good
temper
good
temper
and
leave
it
at
that
no
one
i
think
really
considered
nikitin
at
all
deeply
they
admired
him
for
his
quiet
but
would
have
liked
him
better
had
he
shared
some
of
their
frankness
and
that
was
all
it
happened
that
for
several
days
i
worked
in
the
bandaging
room
directly
under
nikitin
the
work
had
a
peculiar
and
really
unanalysable
fascination
for
me
it
was
perhaps
the
directness
of
contact
that
pleased
me
i
suppose
one
felt
that
here
at
any
rate
one
was
doing
immediate
practical
good
relieving
distress
and
agony
that
must
by
some
one
be
immediately
relieved
and
at
any
rate
in
the
first
days
at
m
when
the
press
of
wounded
was
terrific
we
treated
in
one
day
and
night
nine
hundred
wounded
soldiers
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
real
demand
for
incessant
tireless
work
but
there
was
in
my
pleasure
more
than
this
it
was
as
though
through
the
bodies
of
the
wounded
soldiers
i
was
helping
to
drive
home
the
attack
upon
our
enemy
by
our
enemy
i
do
not
mean
anything
as
concretely
commonplace
as
the
german
nation
one
scarcely
considered
germany
as
a
definite
personality
one
was
resolved
to
cripple
its
power
because
one
believed
that
power
to
be
a
menace
to
the
helpless
the
innocent
the
lovers
of
truth
and
beauty
but
that
resolve
although
it
never
altered
seemed
the
nearer
one
approached
the
citadel
in
some
way
to
be
farther
and
farther
removed
from
the
real
question
germany
was
of
no
importance
and
the
ruin
that
germany
was
wreaking
was
of
no
importance
compared
with
the
histories
of
the
individual
souls
that
were
now
in
the
making
here
were
we
nikitin
trenchard
sister
k
molozov
myself
and
the
others
engaged
upon
our
great
adventure
across
the
surface
of
the
world
at
this
same
instant
out
upon
the
same
hunt
seeking
the
same
answer
to
their
mystery
were
millions
of
our
fellows
somewhere
in
the
heart
of
the
deep
forest
the
enemy
was
hiding
we
would
defeat
him
he
would
catch
us
unawares
he
had
some
plot
some
hidden
surprise
what
should
we
find
when
we
met
him
we
hated
germany
god
knows
with
a
quiet
unresting
interminable
hatred
but
it
was
not
germany
that
we
were
fighting
and
these
wounded
knew
something
that
we
did
not
in
the
first
moments
of
their
agony
when
we
met
them
their
souls
had
not
recovered
from
the
shock
of
their
encounter
it
was
with
many
of
them
more
than
the
mere
physical
pain
they
were
still
held
by
some
discovery
at
whose
very
doors
they
had
been
the
discovery
itself
had
not
been
made
by
them
but
they
had
been
so
near
to
it
that
many
of
them
would
never
be
the
same
man
again
no
your
honour
one
soldier
said
to
me
it
is
my
arm
that
is
nothing
but
life
is
so
real
now
it
is
half
gone
he
would
explain
no
more
since
the
battle
of
s
i
had
been
restless
i
wanted
to
be
back
there
again
and
this
work
was
to
me
like
talking
to
travellers
who
had
come
from
some
country
that
one
knew
and
desired
in
the
early
morning
when
the
light
was
so
cold
and
inhuman
when
the
candles
stuck
in
bottles
on
the
shivered
and
quavered
in
the
little
breeze
when
the
big
basin
on
the
floor
seemed
to
swell
ever
larger
and
larger
with
its
burden
of
bloody
rags
and
soiled
bandages
and
filthy
fragments
of
dirty
clothes
when
the
air
was
weighted
down
with
the
smell
of
blood
and
human
flesh
when
the
sighs
and
groans
and
cries
kept
up
a
perpetual
undercurrent
that
one
did
not
notice
and
yet
faltered
before
when
again
and
again
bodies
torn
almost
in
half
faces
mangled
for
life
hands
battered
into
pulp
legs
hanging
almost
by
a
thread
rose
before
one
passed
and
rose
again
in
endless
procession
then
in
those
early
hours
some
fantastic
world
was
about
one
the
poplar
trees
beyond
the
window
the
little
beechwood
on
the
hill
the
pond
across
the
road
a
round
grey
sheet
of
ruffled
water
these
things
in
the
seemed
to
wait
for
our
defeat
one
instant
on
our
part
and
it
seemed
that
all
the
pain
and
torture
would
rise
in
a
flood
and
overwhelm
one
in
those
early
morning
hours
the
enemy
crept
very
close
indeed
we
could
almost
hear
his
hot
breath
behind
the
bars
of
our
fastened
doors
there
was
a
peculiar
little
headache
that
i
have
felt
nowhere
else
before
or
since
that
attacked
one
on
those
early
mornings
it
was
not
a
headache
that
afflicted
one
with
definite
physical
pain
it
was
like
a
cold
hand
pressing
upon
the
brow
a
hand
that
touched
the
eyes
the
nose
the
mouth
then
remained
a
chill
weight
upon
the
head
the
blood
seemed
to
stop
in
its
course
one
heart
beat
feebly
and
things
were
dim
before
one
eyes
one
was
stupid
and
chose
words
slowly
looking
at
people
closely
to
see
whether
one
really
knew
them
even
unsure
about
oneself
one
history
one
future
neither
hungry
tired
nor
thirsty
neither
sad
nor
joyful
neither
excited
nor
dull
only
with
the
cold
hand
upon
one
brow
catching
with
troubled
breath
the
beating
of
one
heart
in
normal
times
the
was
of
course
taken
in
rotation
but
during
the
pressure
of
these
four
days
we
had
to
snatch
our
rest
when
we
might
about
midnight
on
the
fifth
day
the
procession
of
wounded
suddenly
slackened
and
by
two
in
the
morning
had
ceased
entirely
the
two
nurses
went
to
bed
leaving
nikitin
myself
and
some
sleepy
sanitars
alone
the
little
room
was
empty
of
all
wounded
they
having
been
removed
to
the
tent
on
the
farther
side
of
the
road
the
candles
had
sunk
deep
into
the
bottles
and
were
spluttering
in
a
sea
of
grease
the
room
smelt
abominably
the
blood
on
the
floor
had
trickled
in
thin
red
lines
into
the
cracks
between
the
boards
and
the
basins
with
the
soiled
bandages
overflowed
there
was
absolute
silence
one
sanitar
asleep
had
leaned
still
standing
over
a
chair
and
his
shadow
with
his
heavy
hanging
head
high
above
the
candle
against
the
wall
nikitin
seeming
gigantic
in
the
failing
candlelight
stood
back
against
the
window
he
did
not
keep
as
did
semyonov
perfect
neatness
a
night
of
work
left
him
with
his
hair
on
end
his
black
beard
rough
and
disordered
his
shirtsleeves
were
turned
up
his
arms
stained
with
blood
and
in
his
white
apron
he
looked
like
some
kingly
butcher
i
was
tired
the
cold
headache
was
upon
me
i
wished
that
i
could
go
but
i
knew
that
both
he
and
i
must
stay
until
eight
while
there
was
work
to
do
nothing
mattered
but
now
in
the
silence
the
whole
world
seemed
as
empty
and
foul
as
a
drained
and
stinking
tub
nikitin
looked
at
me
you
tired
he
said
no
i
not
tired
i
answered
i
should
sleep
if
i
went
to
bed
but
i
got
a
headache
that
is
not
a
headache
i
smell
a
smell
that
is
a
smell
i
going
to
be
sick
and
yet
i
not
going
to
be
sick
come
outside
he
said
and
get
rid
of
this
air
we
went
out
and
sat
down
on
a
wooden
bench
that
bordered
the
yard
before
us
was
the
that
ran
from
the
town
of
s
into
the
very
heart
of
the
carpathians
as
the
cold
grey
faded
we
could
catch
the
thin
outline
of
those
mountains
faint
like
upon
the
sky
now
washed
with
pink
covered
in
their
nearer
reaches
by
thick
forests
insubstantial
although
they
were
close
at
hand
like
water
or
long
clouds
we
could
see
the
road
white
and
clear
at
our
feet
melting
into
shadow
beyond
us
and
catching
in
the
little
misty
pools
the
coloured
reflection
of
the
morning
sky
the
air
was
very
fresh
a
cock
behind
me
welcomed
the
sun
the
cold
band
withdrew
from
my
forehead
nikitin
was
silent
and
i
silent
also
sat
there
almost
asleep
happy
and
tranquil
it
seemed
to
me
very
natural
to
him
that
he
should
neither
move
nor
speak
but
after
a
time
he
began
to
talk
i
had
in
that
early
morning
a
strange
impression
as
though
deep
in
my
dreams
i
was
listening
to
some
history
i
know
that
i
did
not
sleep
and
yet
even
now
as
i
recover
his
quiet
voice
and
i
believe
many
of
his
very
words
in
reminiscence
those
hours
are
still
dreaming
hours
i
know
that
every
word
that
he
told
me
then
was
true
in
actual
fact
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
we
were
all
slumbering
the
world
at
our
feet
the
sun
in
the
sky
the
wounded
in
their
tent
and
that
through
the
mist
of
all
that
slumber
nikitin
voice
soft
measured
itself
like
an
echo
of
some
other
voice
miles
away
penetrated
but
to
my
heart
rather
than
to
my
brain
afterwards
this
was
all
strangely
parallel
in
my
mind
with
that
earlier
conversation
that
i
had
had
with
trenchard
in
the
train
and
now
as
i
sit
here
in
so
different
a
place
amongst
men
so
different
those
other
two
come
back
to
me
happy
ghosts
yes
happy
i
know
that
one
at
least
of
them
is
like
water
behind
glass
like
music
behind
a
screen
nikitin
voice
comes
back
to
me
dim
but
so
close
mysterious
but
so
intimate
ah
the
questions
that
i
would
ask
him
now
if
only
i
might
have
those
morning
hours
over
again
you
a
solemn
man
altogether
durward
perhaps
all
englishmen
seem
so
to
us
and
it
may
be
only
your
tranquillity
so
unlike
our
moods
and
nerves
by
which
we
kill
ourselves
dead
before
we
half
way
through
life
i
had
an
english
tutor
for
a
year
when
i
was
a
boy
he
did
teach
me
much
right
and
you
is
the
only
english
i
kept
but
i
think
of
him
now
as
the
very
quietest
man
in
all
the
universe
he
never
seemed
to
breathe
so
still
he
was
and
how
i
admired
him
for
that
my
father
was
a
very
excitable
man
his
moods
and
tempers
killed
him
when
he
was
just
over
forty
we
have
a
proverb
the
still
marshes
there
are
devils
and
we
admire
and
fear
quiet
men
because
they
have
something
that
we
have
not
and
i
like
the
way
that
you
watch
us
durward
your
friend
trenchard
does
not
watch
us
at
all
and
one
could
be
his
friend
for
you
one
has
quite
another
feeling
it
is
as
though
i
had
something
to
give
you
that
you
really
want
why
should
i
not
give
it
you
my
giving
it
will
do
me
no
harm
it
may
even
yield
me
pleasure
you
will
not
throw
it
away
you
are
an
englishman
and
will
not
for
a
moment
temper
or
passion
reveal
secrets
and
there
are
no
secrets
what
i
tell
you
you
may
tell
the
world
but
i
warn
you
that
it
will
neither
interest
them
nor
will
they
believe
it
there
is
you
see
no
climax
to
my
story
i
have
no
story
indeed
like
an
old
feldscher
in
my
village
who
hates
our
village
pope
georg
georgevitch
i
say
you
hate
him
he
is
a
worthy
man
honour
he
says
is
nothing
there
a
fat
man
but
god
has
the
rest
of
him
i
hate
him
for
his
emptiness
in
a
humour
to
talk
i
have
in
a
way
fulfilled
the
purpose
that
my
english
tutor
created
in
me
i
grown
a
sort
of
quiet
skin
you
know
but
under
that
skin
the
heart
pounds
away
the
veins
swell
to
bursting
i
a
fool
behind
it
all
just
a
fool
as
every
russian
is
a
fool
with
more
in
hand
than
he
knows
how
to
deal
with
you
understand
russia
do
you
no
and
i
do
and
no
one
does
but
we
can
all
talk
about
her
and
love
her
too
if
you
like
although
our
sentiment
a
bad
thing
in
us
some
say
but
for
us
not
to
talk
for
one
of
us
to
be
silent
do
you
know
how
hard
that
is
and
through
it
all
how
i
despise
myself
for
wishing
to
tell
them
what
business
is
it
of
theirs
then
this
war
can
you
conceive
what
it
is
doing
to
russians
if
you
have
loved
russia
and
dreamed
for
her
and
had
your
dreams
flung
again
and
again
to
the
ground
and
trampled
on
and
now
once
more
the
bubbles
are
in
the
sky
glittering
gleaming
do
we
not
have
to
speak
do
you
think
must
it
not
be
hard
when
before
we
have
not
been
able
to
be
silent
about
women
and
vodka
to
be
silent
now
about
the
dearest
wish
of
our
heart
we
have
come
out
here
all
of
us
to
see
what
we
will
find
i
have
come
because
i
want
to
get
nearer
to
something
i
had
brought
something
in
my
heart
about
which
i
had
learnt
to
be
silent
is
enough
i
thought
can
be
nothing
else
about
which
i
can
wish
to
talk
but
now
suddenly
like
that
crucifix
on
the
hillock
by
the
road
that
the
sun
has
just
touched
there
is
something
more
and
now
here
we
are
nothing
two
souls
come
together
out
of
space
for
an
hour
and
it
does
matter
what
i
say
to
you
except
that
it
true
and
the
truth
will
be
something
for
you
here
what
i
come
to
the
war
with
my
little
bit
of
possession
if
you
like
that
i
brought
with
me
as
all
brought
something
will
you
understand
me
perhaps
not
and
it
really
does
matter
i
know
what
i
have
what
i
want
but
not
what
i
am
so
how
should
you
know
if
i
do
not
and
i
love
life
i
believe
in
god
i
wish
to
meet
death
one
can
be
serious
without
being
absurd
at
an
early
hour
like
this
when
nothing
is
real
except
such
things
andrey
vassilievitch
and
myself
have
puzzled
you
have
we
not
i
have
seen
you
watching
us
very
seriously
as
though
we
were
figures
in
a
novel
and
that
has
amazed
me
because
you
must
not
be
solemn
about
us
you
understand
nothing
about
russian
life
unless
you
laugh
at
it
during
at
least
half
the
week
almost
five
years
ago
i
met
andrey
vassilievitch
at
a
friend
house
in
petrograd
he
was
an
acquaintance
of
mine
of
some
years
duration
but
i
had
avoided
him
because
he
seemed
to
me
the
last
kind
of
man
whom
i
would
ever
care
to
know
i
had
been
at
this
time
five
years
in
petrograd
and
had
now
a
good
practice
there
as
a
surgeon
i
was
a
successful
man
and
i
knew
it
but
i
was
also
a
disappointed
man
because
my
idealism
that
was
being
for
ever
wounded
by
my
own
actions
would
not
die
how
i
wished
for
it
to
die
i
thought
of
the
day
when
i
should
be
without
it
as
the
day
of
liberation
of
freedom
that
had
become
my
idea
i
must
tell
you
the
dominating
idea
of
my
life
that
i
should
kill
my
idealism
laugh
at
the
belief
in
god
lose
faith
in
every
one
and
everything
and
then
simply
enjoy
myself
my
work
which
i
loved
and
my
pleasure
which
i
should
love
when
my
idealism
had
died
sometimes
during
those
years
i
thought
that
it
was
dying
women
helped
to
kill
it
i
believed
and
i
knew
many
women
desperately
persistently
laughing
at
them
leaving
them
or
being
left
by
them
and
then
in
spite
of
myself
bitterly
deeply
disappointed
something
always
saying
to
me
am
god
and
you
can
not
hide
from
me
am
god
and
i
will
not
be
hidden
and
on
this
night
about
five
years
ago
at
the
house
of
a
friend
i
met
andrey
vassilievitch
we
left
the
house
together
and
because
it
was
a
fine
night
walked
down
the
nevski
there
at
the
corner
of
the
morskaia
because
he
was
a
nervous
man
who
wished
to
be
well
with
every
one
in
the
world
and
because
he
had
nothing
especial
to
say
he
asked
me
to
dinner
and
i
because
it
was
a
fine
night
and
there
had
been
good
wine
said
that
i
would
go
the
next
day
i
cursed
my
folly
i
do
not
know
to
this
day
why
i
did
not
break
the
engagement
it
would
have
been
sufficiently
easy
but
break
it
i
did
not
and
a
week
later
reluctantly
i
went
do
you
know
how
houses
and
streets
of
which
you
have
observed
nothing
afterwards
called
out
by
some
important
event
leap
into
detail
that
night
i
swear
that
i
saw
nothing
of
that
little
street
behind
the
mariinsky
theatre
it
was
a
fine
night
at
the
end
of
may
and
the
theatre
was
in
a
bustle
of
arrivals
because
it
was
nearly
eight
not
at
all
the
hour
of
russian
dinner
as
you
know
but
andrey
vassilievitch
always
liked
to
be
as
english
as
possible
i
tell
you
that
i
saw
nothing
of
the
street
and
yet
now
i
know
that
at
the
door
of
the
little
there
were
two
men
and
a
woman
laughing
that
an
was
drawn
up
in
front
of
a
high
white
block
of
flats
asleep
his
head
fallen
on
his
breast
that
the
wonderful
light
faintly
blue
and
misty
like
gauze
hung
down
from
the
sky
down
over
the
houses
but
falling
not
quite
on
to
the
pavement
which
was
hard
and
ugly
and
grey
the
little
street
was
very
silent
and
quiet
and
had
like
so
many
petrograd
streets
a
decorous
intimacy
with
the
eighteenth
century
ghosts
thronging
its
air
afterwards
how
i
was
to
know
that
street
every
stone
and
corner
of
it
it
seems
wonderful
to
me
now
that
i
trod
its
pavement
that
night
so
carelessly
my
destination
was
a
square
little
house
at
the
corner
on
the
right
andrey
vassilievitch
boasted
a
whole
house
to
himself
a
rare
pride
in
our
city
as
you
know
when
i
was
inside
the
doors
i
knew
at
once
that
it
was
not
andrey
vassilievitch
house
at
all
some
stronger
spirit
than
his
was
there
knowing
him
i
had
expected
to
find
there
many
modern
things
some
imitation
of
english
manners
some
bad
but
expensive
pictures
a
gramophone
a
pianolo
a
library
of
russian
classics
in
our
hideous
modern
bindings
a
you
know
the
character
how
quiet
this
little
house
was
in
the
little
square
hall
an
old
faded
carpet
a
grandfather
clock
and
two
eighteenth
century
prints
of
petrograd
all
the
rooms
were
square
so
russian
with
their
placid
family
portraits
their
old
tables
and
chairs
not
beautiful
save
for
their
fidelity
and
old
thumbed
editions
of
pushkin
and
gogol
and
lermontov
in
the
bookshelves
clocks
old
slow
clocks
all
telling
different
time
all
over
the
house
the
house
was
very
neat
but
in
odd
corners
there
were
all
those
odd
family
things
that
russians
collect
china
of
the
worst
period
brass
trays
large
candlesticks
musical
boxes
anything
you
please
only
in
the
there
was
some
attempt
at
modernity
bad
modern
furniture
on
the
walls
bad
copies
of
such
things
as
somoff
lady
vrubel
and
one
of
benoit
the
great
beyond
this
room
the
house
was
of
eighty
years
ago
muffled
in
its
old
furniture
speaking
with
the
voice
of
its
old
clocks
scented
with
the
scent
of
its
musk
and
lavender
watched
by
the
contented
gaze
of
the
old
family
portraits
alexandra
pavlovna
andrey
vassilievitch
wife
was
waiting
for
us
has
it
happened
to
you
yet
that
your
life
that
has
been
such
and
such
a
life
is
in
the
moment
of
a
all
another
life
you
have
passed
an
examination
you
are
suddenly
ill
you
break
your
back
by
a
fall
or
more
simply
than
all
of
these
you
enter
a
town
see
a
picture
hear
a
bar
of
music
the
thing
done
all
values
changed
what
you
saw
before
you
see
no
longer
what
you
needed
before
you
need
no
longer
what
you
expected
before
you
expect
no
longer
alexandra
pavlovna
was
not
a
beautiful
woman
not
tall
with
hair
quite
grey
eyes
not
dark
nor
light
sad
though
when
she
smiled
there
was
great
charm
but
so
it
is
true
of
many
women
her
complexion
was
always
pale
and
her
voice
although
it
was
sweet
to
those
who
loved
her
was
perhaps
too
quiet
to
be
greatly
remarked
by
strangers
i
have
known
men
who
thought
her
an
ordinary
woman
she
had
much
humour
but
did
not
show
it
to
every
one
she
was
as
still
as
that
cloud
there
above
the
hill
full
of
colour
like
that
is
to
those
who
loved
her
seen
from
another
view
as
perhaps
that
cloud
may
be
there
was
nothing
wonderful
nothing
wonderful
but
so
many
loved
her
there
was
never
i
think
a
woman
so
greatly
beloved
and
you
may
judge
by
me
i
had
led
a
life
in
which
after
my
work
women
had
always
played
the
chief
part
and
as
the
months
passed
and
i
had
grown
proud
i
had
vowed
that
women
must
be
exceptional
to
please
me
i
had
felt
the
eye
of
the
world
upon
me
see
no
ordinary
women
in
victor
company
i
heard
them
say
and
i
was
proud
that
they
should
say
it
from
the
first
instant
of
seeing
alexandra
pavlovna
i
loved
her
and
i
loved
her
in
a
new
an
utterly
new
way
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
did
not
think
of
myself
as
a
traveller
who
passing
for
many
years
through
countries
that
did
not
greatly
interest
him
feels
his
aches
and
pains
his
money
troubles
his
discomforts
and
little
personal
irritations
then
suddenly
he
crosses
the
border
and
the
new
land
so
possesses
him
that
he
is
only
a
vessel
for
its
beauty
to
absorb
it
to
hold
it
to
carry
the
burden
of
it
in
safety
i
crossed
the
border
for
four
years
after
that
i
pursued
that
enchanted
journey
why
did
i
love
her
who
can
say
andrey
vassilievitch
adored
her
with
an
utter
devotion
and
had
done
so
since
the
first
moment
of
meeting
her
i
have
known
many
others
women
and
men
who
felt
that
devotion
on
that
first
evening
we
were
very
quiet
only
another
woman
a
cousin
of
hers
after
dinner
i
had
half
an
hour
talk
with
her
i
can
see
her
ah
how
i
can
see
you
my
dear
sitting
back
a
little
in
her
chair
resting
her
hands
folded
very
quietly
in
her
lap
her
eyes
watching
me
gravely
i
felt
like
a
boy
who
has
come
into
the
world
for
the
first
time
i
could
not
talk
to
her
i
stammered
over
the
simplest
things
but
i
was
conscious
of
a
deep
luxurious
delight
i
did
not
as
i
had
done
before
lay
plans
say
that
would
be
so
if
i
did
i
did
not
consciously
try
to
influence
or
direct
her
i
felt
no
definite
sensual
attraction
did
not
say
as
i
had
always
done
with
other
women
is
the
hair
the
eyes
the
mouth
if
i
thought
at
all
it
was
only
is
better
than
anything
that
i
have
known
before
i
had
never
dreamt
of
anything
like
this
after
i
had
left
her
that
night
i
did
not
walk
the
streets
nor
drink
nor
find
companions
i
went
home
and
slept
the
soundest
sleep
of
my
life
in
the
morning
i
knew
tranquillity
for
the
first
time
in
all
my
days
i
did
not
as
i
had
done
after
many
earlier
first
meetings
hasten
to
see
my
friend
i
did
not
know
even
that
she
liked
me
and
yet
i
felt
no
doubt
nor
confusion
it
was
perhaps
that
i
was
ready
to
accept
this
new
influence
under
any
conditions
was
ready
for
once
to
leave
the
rules
to
another
i
felt
no
curiosity
knew
no
determination
to
discover
the
conditions
of
her
life
that
i
might
bend
them
to
my
own
purposes
i
was
quite
passive
untroubled
and
of
a
marvellous
almost
selfish
happiness
our
friendship
continued
very
easily
it
soon
came
to
our
meeting
every
day
in
the
summer
they
moved
to
their
house
in
finland
and
i
went
to
stay
with
them
but
it
was
not
until
her
return
to
petrograd
in
september
that
i
told
her
that
i
loved
her
upon
one
of
the
first
autumn
days
upon
an
evening
when
the
little
green
tree
outside
their
door
was
gold
and
there
was
a
slip
of
an
apricot
moon
when
the
first
fires
were
lighted
andrey
vassilievitch
had
english
fireplaces
sitting
alone
together
in
her
little
faded
room
i
told
her
that
i
loved
her
she
listened
very
quietly
as
i
talked
her
eyes
on
my
face
grave
sad
perhaps
and
yet
humorous
secure
in
her
own
settled
life
but
sharing
also
in
the
life
of
others
she
watched
me
rather
as
a
mother
watches
her
child
i
told
her
that
it
mattered
nothing
the
conditions
that
she
put
upon
me
that
so
long
as
i
saw
her
and
knew
that
she
believed
me
to
be
her
friend
i
asked
for
nothing
she
answered
still
very
quietly
but
putting
her
hand
on
mine
that
she
had
loved
me
from
the
first
moment
of
our
meeting
that
she
wondered
that
yet
once
again
love
should
have
come
into
her
life
when
she
had
thought
that
that
was
all
finished
for
her
she
told
me
that
love
had
been
in
her
life
nothing
but
pain
and
distress
and
then
she
asked
me
very
simply
whether
i
would
try
to
keep
this
thing
so
that
it
should
be
happy
and
should
endure
i
said
that
i
would
obey
her
in
anything
that
she
should
command
there
followed
then
the
strangest
life
for
me
lovers
in
the
fullest
sense
we
were
and
yet
it
was
different
from
any
love
that
i
had
ever
known
when
i
ask
myself
why
in
what
it
differed
i
can
not
answer
two
old
grey
people
who
happened
to
suit
one
another
not
romantic
but
i
think
in
the
end
of
it
all
the
reason
was
that
she
never
revealed
herself
to
me
entirely
i
was
always
curious
about
her
always
felt
that
other
people
knew
more
of
her
than
i
did
always
thought
that
one
day
i
should
know
all
it
is
all
that
kills
love
and
i
never
knew
all
we
were
always
together
she
was
a
woman
of
very
remarkable
intelligence
loving
music
literature
painting
with
a
most
excellently
critical
love
her
friendship
with
me
gave
her
i
do
believe
a
new
youth
and
happiness
we
became
inseparable
and
all
my
earlier
life
had
passed
away
from
me
like
clothes
i
was
happy
but
of
course
i
was
not
satisfied
i
was
jealous
of
that
which
andrey
vassilievitch
had
and
i
lacked
my
whole
relationship
to
andrey
vassilievitch
was
a
curious
one
my
friendship
for
his
wife
must
i
am
sure
have
been
torture
to
him
he
knew
that
she
had
given
me
a
great
deal
that
she
had
never
given
to
him
and
yet
because
he
loved
her
so
profoundly
he
was
only
anxious
that
she
should
be
happy
he
saw
that
my
friendship
gave
her
new
interests
new
life
even
he
encouraged
me
then
in
every
way
to
stay
with
them
to
be
with
them
he
left
us
alone
continually
during
the
whole
of
that
four
years
he
never
once
spoke
in
anger
to
me
nor
challenged
my
fidelity
my
relationship
to
him
was
difficult
we
were
quite
simply
as
men
the
in
the
world
he
had
not
a
trick
nor
a
habit
that
did
not
get
on
my
nerves
he
was
intelligent
only
in
those
things
that
i
despised
a
man
for
knowing
this
would
have
been
well
enough
had
he
not
persisted
in
talking
about
matters
of
art
and
literature
of
which
of
course
he
knew
nothing
he
did
it
i
believe
to
please
his
wife
and
myself
i
despised
him
for
many
things
and
yet
in
my
heart
i
knew
that
he
had
much
that
i
had
not
he
was
and
is
a
finer
man
than
i
and
last
and
first
of
all
he
possessed
part
of
his
wife
that
i
did
not
after
all
she
did
in
her
own
beautiful
way
love
him
she
was
a
mother
to
him
she
laughed
tenderly
at
his
foolishness
cared
for
him
watched
over
him
defended
him
me
she
would
never
need
to
defend
our
relationship
was
built
rather
on
my
defence
of
her
sometimes
i
would
wish
that
i
were
such
a
as
andrey
vassilievitch
that
i
might
have
her
protection
there
were
many
many
times
when
i
hated
him
no
times
at
all
when
he
did
not
irritate
me
i
wished
i
wished
i
do
not
know
what
i
wished
only
i
always
waited
for
the
time
when
i
should
have
all
of
her
when
i
should
hold
her
against
all
the
world
then
after
four
years
of
this
new
life
she
quite
suddenly
died
again
in
that
little
house
on
a
night
just
as
when
i
had
at
first
met
her
the
purple
curtains
hanging
in
the
little
street
the
sleeping
the
clocks
in
the
house
chattering
in
their
haste
to
keep
up
with
time
only
two
months
before
the
outbreak
of
the
war
she
caught
cold
for
a
week
suffered
from
pneumonia
and
died
at
the
last
andrey
vassilievitch
and
i
were
alone
with
her
he
had
her
hand
in
his
but
her
last
cry
was
and
as
she
died
i
felt
as
though
at
last
after
that
long
waiting
she
had
leapt
into
my
arms
for
ever
after
her
death
for
many
weeks
she
was
with
me
more
completely
than
she
had
been
during
her
lifetime
i
knew
that
she
was
dead
but
i
thought
that
i
also
had
died
i
went
into
finland
alone
saw
no
one
talked
to
no
one
saw
only
her
then
quite
suddenly
i
came
to
life
again
she
withdrew
from
me
work
seemed
the
only
possible
thing
but
i
was
during
all
this
time
happy
not
miserable
she
was
not
with
me
but
she
was
not
very
far
away
then
andrey
vassilievitch
came
back
to
me
he
told
me
that
he
knew
that
she
had
loved
me
that
he
had
tried
to
speak
of
her
to
others
who
had
known
her
but
they
had
none
of
them
had
real
knowledge
of
her
might
he
speak
to
me
sometimes
about
her
i
found
that
though
he
irritated
me
more
than
ever
i
liked
to
talk
about
her
to
him
as
i
spoke
of
her
he
scarcely
was
present
at
all
and
yet
he
had
known
her
and
loved
her
and
would
listen
for
ever
and
ever
if
i
wished
when
the
war
had
lasted
some
months
the
fancy
came
to
me
that
i
could
get
nearer
to
her
by
going
into
it
i
might
even
die
which
would
be
best
of
all
i
did
not
wish
to
kill
myself
because
i
felt
that
to
be
a
coward
death
and
in
such
a
way
i
thought
that
i
would
only
separate
myself
from
her
but
in
the
war
perhaps
i
might
meet
death
in
such
a
way
as
to
show
him
that
i
despised
him
both
for
myself
and
her
by
suicide
i
would
be
paying
him
reverence
some
such
thought
also
had
andrey
vassilievitch
i
heard
that
he
thought
of
attaching
himself
to
some
red
cross
otriad
i
told
him
my
plans
he
said
no
more
but
suddenly
as
you
know
i
found
him
on
the
platform
of
the
warsaw
station
afterwards
he
apologised
to
me
said
that
he
must
be
near
me
that
he
would
try
not
to
annoy
me
that
if
sometimes
he
spoke
of
her
to
me
he
hoped
that
i
would
not
mind
and
i
what
do
i
feel
i
do
not
know
he
has
some
share
in
her
that
i
have
not
i
have
some
share
in
her
that
he
has
not
and
i
think
that
it
has
come
to
both
of
us
that
the
one
of
us
who
dies
first
will
attain
her
it
seems
to
me
now
that
she
is
continually
with
me
but
i
believe
that
this
is
nothing
to
the
knowledge
i
shall
have
of
her
one
day
am
i
right
is
andrey
vassilievitch
right
can
it
be
that
such
a
man
such
men
i
should
say
as
either
i
or
he
will
ever
be
given
such
happiness
i
do
not
know
i
only
know
that
god
exists
that
love
is
more
powerful
than
man
that
death
can
fall
before
us
if
we
believe
that
it
will
that
the
soul
of
man
is
power
and
love
i
believe
in
god
chapter
v
first
move
to
the
enemy
it
was
during
two
nights
in
the
forest
of
s
about
which
i
must
afterwards
write
that
i
had
those
long
conversations
with
trenchard
upon
whose
evidence
now
i
must
very
largely
depend
before
me
as
i
write
is
his
diary
left
to
me
by
him
in
this
whole
business
of
the
war
there
is
nothing
more
difficult
than
the
varied
and
confused
succession
with
which
moods
impressions
fancies
succeed
one
upon
another
but
trenchard
told
me
so
simply
and
yet
so
graphically
of
the
events
of
these
weeks
that
followed
the
battle
of
s
that
i
believe
i
am
departing
in
no
way
from
the
truth
in
my
present
account
the
truth
at
any
rate
as
he
himself
believed
it
to
be
the
only
impression
that
he
brought
away
with
him
from
the
battle
of
s
was
that
picture
lighted
by
the
horizon
fires
of
marie
ivanovna
kneeling
with
her
hand
on
semyonov
shoulder
that
every
detail
and
colour
of
it
bit
into
his
brain
in
understanding
him
it
is
of
the
first
importance
to
remember
that
this
was
the
one
and
only
love
business
of
his
life
the
effect
of
those
days
in
petrograd
when
marie
ivanovna
had
shown
him
that
she
liked
him
the
thundering
stupefying
effect
of
that
night
when
she
had
accepted
his
love
must
have
caught
his
soul
and
changed
it
as
glass
is
caught
by
the
worker
and
blown
into
shape
and
colour
there
he
was
fashioned
and
purified
ready
for
her
use
what
would
she
make
of
him
that
she
should
make
nothing
of
him
at
all
was
as
incredible
to
him
as
that
there
should
not
be
somewhere
in
the
world
polchester
town
in
glebeshire
county
there
had
been
with
him
i
think
from
the
first
a
fear
that
it
was
all
too
good
to
be
true
danaos
et
dona
it
is
not
easy
for
any
man
after
thirty
years
shy
shrinking
from
the
world
to
shake
himself
free
of
superstitions
and
such
terrors
the
quiet
and
retired
polchester
had
bred
in
trenchard
heart
as
though
it
had
been
the
very
epitome
of
life
at
its
lowest
and
vilest
it
simply
came
to
this
that
he
refused
to
believe
that
marie
ivanovna
had
been
given
to
him
only
to
be
taken
away
again
about
women
he
knew
simply
nothing
and
russian
women
are
not
the
least
complicated
of
their
sex
about
marie
ivanovna
he
of
course
knew
nothing
at
all
his
first
weeks
in
our
otriad
had
been
like
the
painful
return
to
drab
reality
after
a
splendid
dream
after
all
i
am
the
hopeless
creature
i
thought
i
was
what
was
there
in
those
days
in
petrograd
that
could
blind
me
his
shyness
returned
his
awkwardness
his
mistakes
in
tact
and
resource
were
upon
him
again
like
a
suit
of
badly
made
clothes
he
knew
this
but
he
believed
that
it
could
make
no
difference
to
his
lady
so
sure
was
he
of
himself
in
regard
to
her
she
might
be
transformed
into
anything
hideous
or
vile
and
still
now
he
would
love
her
that
he
could
not
believe
that
she
would
change
the
love
that
had
come
to
them
was
surely
eternal
it
must
be
it
must
be
it
must
be
he
failed
altogether
to
understand
her
youth
her
inexperience
above
all
her
coloured
romantic
fancy
her
romantic
fancy
had
made
him
in
her
eyes
for
a
brief
hour
something
that
he
was
not
after
a
month
at
the
war
i
believe
that
she
had
grown
into
a
woman
she
had
loved
him
for
an
instant
as
a
young
girl
loves
a
hero
of
a
novel
and
although
she
was
now
a
woman
she
must
still
keep
her
romantic
fancy
he
was
no
longer
part
of
that
only
a
clumsy
man
at
whom
people
laughed
she
must
i
think
have
suffered
at
her
own
awakening
for
she
was
honest
impetuous
pure
if
ever
woman
was
those
things
he
did
not
see
her
as
she
was
he
still
clung
to
his
confidence
but
he
began
as
the
days
advanced
to
be
terribly
afraid
his
fears
centred
themselves
round
semyonov
semyonov
must
have
seemed
to
him
an
awful
figure
powerful
contemptuous
any
blunders
that
he
committed
were
doubled
by
semyonov
presence
he
could
do
nothing
right
if
semyonov
were
there
he
was
only
too
ready
to
believe
that
semyonov
knew
the
world
and
he
did
not
and
if
semyonov
thought
him
a
fool
it
was
quite
obvious
what
semyonov
thought
him
then
a
fool
he
must
be
he
clung
desperately
to
the
hope
that
there
would
be
a
battle
a
romantic
dramatic
battle
and
that
in
it
he
would
most
gloriously
distinguish
himself
he
believed
that
for
her
sake
he
would
face
all
the
terrors
of
hell
the
battle
came
and
there
were
no
terrors
of
hell
only
sick
headache
noise
men
desperately
wounded
and
once
again
his
own
clumsiness
then
in
that
final
picture
of
marie
ivanovna
and
semyonov
he
saw
his
own
most
miserable
exclusion
in
the
days
that
followed
there
was
much
work
and
he
was
forgotten
he
assisted
in
the
in
later
days
he
was
to
prove
most
efficient
and
capable
but
at
first
he
was
shy
and
nervous
and
semyonov
who
seemed
always
to
be
present
did
not
spare
him
then
quite
suddenly
marie
ivanovna
changed
she
was
kinder
to
him
than
she
had
ever
been
yes
kinder
than
during
those
early
days
in
petrograd
we
all
noticed
the
change
in
her
when
she
was
with
him
in
the
she
whispered
advice
to
him
helped
him
when
she
had
a
free
moment
laughed
with
him
put
him
of
course
into
a
heaven
of
delight
how
happy
at
once
he
was
his
clumsiness
instantly
fell
away
from
him
he
only
smiled
when
semyonov
sneered
his
russian
improved
in
a
remarkable
manner
she
was
tender
to
him
as
though
she
were
much
older
than
he
he
has
told
me
that
in
spite
of
his
joy
that
tenderness
alarmed
him
also
when
he
kissed
her
she
drew
back
a
little
and
she
did
not
reply
when
he
spoke
of
their
marriage
but
for
four
days
he
was
happy
he
used
to
sing
to
himself
as
he
walked
about
the
house
in
a
high
cracked
voice
one
song
did
but
see
her
passing
another
one
i
can
hear
him
now
his
voice
breaking
always
on
the
high
notes
one
morning
just
as
the
sun
was
rising
i
heard
a
maid
singing
in
the
valley
below
ah
do
deceive
me
pray
never
leave
me
how
could
you
treat
a
poor
maiden
so
his
pockets
were
more
full
than
ever
of
knives
and
string
and
buttons
his
smile
when
he
was
happy
lightened
his
face
changing
the
lines
of
it
making
it
if
not
handsome
pleasant
and
friendly
he
would
talk
to
himself
in
english
ruffling
his
hands
through
his
hair
and
then
at
three
i
must
go
with
andrey
vassilievitch
or
i
wonder
whether
she
mind
if
i
ask
he
had
a
large
briar
pipe
at
which
he
puffed
furiously
but
could
not
smoke
without
an
endless
procession
of
matches
that
afterwards
littered
the
floor
around
him
the
damp
he
explained
to
us
a
hundred
times
it
better
damp
then
quite
suddenly
the
blow
fell
one
evening
as
they
were
standing
alone
together
in
the
yard
watching
the
yellow
sky
die
into
dusk
without
any
preparation
she
spoke
to
him
john
she
said
i
ca
marry
you
he
heard
her
as
though
she
had
spoken
to
another
man
it
was
as
though
he
said
ah
that
will
be
bad
news
for
i
do
understand
he
said
and
instantly
afterwards
his
heart
began
to
beat
like
a
raging
beast
and
his
knees
trembled
i
ca
marry
you
she
told
him
because
i
do
love
you
ah
known
it
a
long
time
ever
since
we
left
petrograd
i
often
often
wanted
to
tell
you
i
been
afraid
you
ca
marry
me
he
repeated
but
you
must
then
hurriedly
no
i
should
say
that
you
must
forgive
me
you
have
confused
me
i
very
unhappy
i
been
unhappy
a
long
time
it
was
a
mistake
in
petrograd
i
do
love
you
but
it
is
only
that
you
would
be
happy
with
me
you
think
now
but
it
a
mistake
he
has
told
me
that
as
the
idea
worked
through
to
his
brain
his
only
thought
was
that
he
must
keep
her
at
all
costs
under
any
conditions
keep
her
you
ca
you
must
he
whispered
staring
as
though
he
would
hold
her
by
her
eyes
do
you
see
that
you
must
what
am
i
to
do
after
all
this
what
are
we
both
to
do
it
breaking
everything
i
sha
believe
in
anything
if
you
ah
but
no
you
do
really
mean
anything
he
saw
that
she
was
trembling
and
he
bent
forward
put
his
arm
very
gently
round
her
as
though
he
would
protect
her
but
she
very
strongly
drew
away
from
him
looked
him
in
the
face
then
dropped
her
eyes
let
her
whole
body
droop
as
though
she
were
most
bitterly
ashamed
i
do
know
she
said
what
i
been
what
i
done
during
these
last
weeks
i
been
terrible
to
myself
and
yet
it
better
too
i
did
live
a
real
life
before
and
now
i
see
things
as
they
are
i
do
love
you
john
and
so
we
must
marry
he
looked
at
her
and
then
suddenly
wild
furious
shouting
at
her
you
must
you
dare
not
then
go
if
you
wish
i
do
want
you
do
you
hear
i
do
want
i
do
want
you
she
turned
and
walked
swiftly
into
the
house
he
watched
her
go
then
with
quick
stumbling
steps
hurried
into
the
field
below
the
farm
there
he
stood
thinking
of
nothing
knowing
nothing
seeing
nothing
the
dusk
came
up
there
had
been
rain
during
the
day
the
mist
was
in
grey
sheets
the
wet
dank
smell
of
the
earth
and
of
the
vegetables
amongst
which
he
stood
grew
stronger
as
the
light
faded
he
thought
of
nothing
nothing
at
all
he
felt
in
his
pocket
for
his
pipe
something
dropped
and
he
knelt
down
there
on
the
soaking
ground
searching
he
searched
furiously
raging
to
himself
again
and
again
oh
i
must
find
it
i
must
find
it
i
must
find
it
his
hands
tore
the
wet
vegetables
were
thick
with
the
soil
other
things
fell
from
his
pockets
then
the
rain
began
to
descend
again
thin
and
cold
in
some
building
he
could
hear
a
horse
moving
stamping
he
pulled
up
the
vegetables
by
their
roots
in
his
search
as
though
a
sword
had
struck
him
his
brain
was
clear
he
knew
of
his
loss
he
flung
himself
on
the
ground
rubbing
the
wet
soil
on
to
his
face
whispering
desperately
oh
god
oh
god
oh
god
on
the
day
following
we
did
not
know
of
what
had
happened
trenchard
was
not
with
us
as
he
was
sent
about
midday
with
some
sanitars
to
bury
the
dead
in
a
wood
five
miles
from
m
that
must
have
been
in
many
ways
the
most
terrible
day
of
his
life
and
during
it
for
the
first
time
he
was
to
know
that
unreality
that
comes
to
every
one
sooner
or
later
at
the
war
it
is
an
unreality
that
is
the
more
terrible
because
it
selects
from
reality
details
that
can
not
be
denied
selects
them
without
transformation
saying
to
his
victim
these
things
are
as
you
have
always
seen
them
therefore
this
world
is
as
you
have
always
seen
it
it
is
real
i
tell
you
let
that
false
reality
be
admitted
and
there
is
no
more
peace
on
this
day
there
were
the
two
sanitars
whose
faces
now
he
knew
walking
solidly
beside
his
cart
there
were
the
little
orchards
with
the
soldiers
tents
sheltering
beneath
them
the
villages
with
the
old
men
the
women
the
children
watching
like
ghosts
their
passage
the
fields
in
which
the
summer
corn
was
ripening
the
first
trembling
heat
and
beauty
of
a
quiet
day
in
early
june
no
sound
in
the
world
but
peace
the
woods
opening
around
them
as
they
advanced
he
lay
back
on
his
bumping
cart
watching
the
world
as
though
he
was
seeing
pictures
of
some
place
where
he
had
once
been
but
long
left
yes
long
ago
he
had
left
it
his
world
was
now
a
narrow
burning
chamber
in
which
dwelt
with
him
a
taunting
jeering
torturing
spirit
of
reminiscence
he
saw
with
the
utmost
clearness
every
detail
of
his
relationship
with
marie
ivanovna
he
had
no
doubt
at
all
that
that
relationship
was
finally
hopelessly
closed
his
was
not
a
character
that
was
the
stronger
for
misfortune
he
submitted
crushed
to
the
ground
his
mind
now
dwelt
upon
that
journey
from
petrograd
a
journey
of
incredible
ironic
ecstasy
lighted
with
the
fires
of
the
wonderful
spring
that
had
accompanied
it
he
recalled
every
detail
of
his
conversation
with
me
his
confidence
that
life
would
now
be
fine
for
him
how
could
life
ever
be
fine
for
a
man
who
let
the
prizes
the
treasures
slip
from
his
fingers
without
an
attempt
to
clutch
them
it
was
so
now
that
he
saw
the
whole
of
the
affair
blame
of
marie
ivanovna
there
was
none
only
of
his
own
weakness
his
imbecile
idiotic
weakness
in
that
last
conversation
with
her
why
could
he
not
have
said
that
he
refused
to
let
her
go
held
to
her
dominated
her
as
a
strong
man
would
have
done
no
without
a
word
except
a
cry
of
impotent
childish
rage
he
had
submitted
so
all
his
life
it
had
been
so
all
his
life
it
would
be
he
could
only
wonder
now
at
his
easy
ready
belief
that
happiness
would
last
for
him
had
happiness
ever
lasted
as
a
man
began
so
he
ended
life
laughed
at
him
and
would
always
laugh
nevertheless
he
that
journey
five
days
of
perfect
unalloyed
delight
nobody
could
rob
him
of
that
she
had
said
to
him
that
even
at
the
beginning
of
the
journey
she
had
known
that
she
did
not
love
him
she
had
known
but
he
had
not
and
even
though
he
had
cheated
himself
with
the
glittering
bubble
of
an
illusion
the
splendour
had
been
there
meanwhile
behind
his
despair
there
was
something
else
stirring
he
has
told
me
that
upon
that
afternoon
he
was
only
very
dimly
very
very
faintly
aware
of
it
aware
of
it
only
fiercely
to
deny
it
he
knew
however
stoutly
he
might
refuse
to
acknowledge
it
that
the
events
of
the
last
weeks
had
bred
in
him
some
curiosity
some
excitement
that
he
could
not
analyse
he
would
like
to
have
thought
that
his
life
began
and
ended
only
in
marie
ivanovna
but
the
battle
of
s
had
as
it
were
in
spite
of
himself
left
something
more
he
found
that
he
recalled
the
details
of
that
battle
as
though
his
taking
part
in
it
had
bound
him
to
something
even
it
was
suggested
to
him
that
there
was
something
now
that
he
must
do
outside
his
love
for
marie
ivanovna
something
that
had
perhaps
no
connexion
with
her
at
all
in
the
very
heart
of
his
misery
he
was
conscious
that
a
little
pulse
was
beating
that
was
strange
to
him
foreign
to
him
it
was
as
though
he
were
warned
that
he
had
embarked
upon
some
voyage
that
must
be
carried
through
to
the
very
end
he
was
in
truth
less
completely
overwhelmed
by
his
catastrophe
than
he
knew
as
they
now
advanced
and
entered
upon
the
first
outworks
of
the
carpathians
the
day
clouded
they
stumbled
down
into
a
little
narrow
brown
valley
and
drove
there
by
the
side
of
an
ugly
naked
stream
wandering
sluggishly
through
mud
and
weeds
over
them
the
woods
grey
and
sullen
had
completely
closed
the
sun
a
round
glazed
disk
sharply
defined
but
without
colour
was
like
a
dirty
plate
in
the
sky
up
again
into
the
woods
then
over
rough
cart
tracks
they
came
finally
to
a
standstill
amongst
thick
brushwood
and
dripping
undergrowth
they
could
hear
very
far
away
the
noise
of
cannon
the
sanitars
were
inclined
to
grumble
nice
sort
of
business
looking
for
dead
men
here
your
honour
we
must
leave
the
carts
here
and
go
on
foot
what
it
wet
for
it
has
been
raining
why
was
it
wet
indeed
a
heavy
brooding
inertia
trenchard
has
told
me
seemed
to
seize
them
all
they
were
not
pleasant
trees
you
know
i
remember
his
afterwards
telling
me
all
dirty
and
tangled
and
we
all
looked
dirty
too
there
was
an
unpleasant
smell
in
the
air
but
that
afternoon
i
simply
did
care
about
anything
nothing
mattered
i
do
think
that
the
sanitars
at
that
time
respected
trenchard
very
greatly
he
was
in
any
case
a
man
of
authority
and
his
broken
stammering
russian
would
help
him
then
there
is
nothing
stranger
than
the
fashion
in
which
the
russian
language
will
if
you
are
a
timid
foreigner
of
a
sudden
wilfully
desert
you
be
bold
with
it
and
it
may
somewhat
haughtily
perhaps
consent
to
your
use
of
it
be
frightened
of
it
and
it
will
despise
you
for
ever
upon
that
afternoon
it
deserted
trenchard
even
his
own
language
seemed
to
have
left
him
his
brain
was
cold
and
damp
like
the
woods
around
him
they
passed
through
the
thickets
and
came
to
their
great
surprise
upon
a
trench
occupied
by
soldiers
this
surprised
them
because
they
had
heard
that
the
austrians
were
many
versts
distant
the
soldiers
also
seemed
to
wonder
they
explained
their
mission
to
a
young
officer
who
seemed
at
first
as
though
he
would
ask
them
something
then
checked
himself
gave
them
permission
to
pass
through
and
watched
them
with
grave
gaze
after
they
had
crossed
the
barbed
wire
the
woods
suddenly
closed
about
them
as
though
a
door
had
been
softly
shut
behind
them
the
ground
now
squelched
beneath
their
feet
the
sky
between
the
trees
was
like
damp
and
the
smell
that
had
been
only
faintly
in
the
air
before
was
now
heavy
around
them
blown
in
thick
gusts
as
the
wind
moved
through
the
trees
shrapnel
now
could
be
distinctly
heard
at
no
great
distance
with
its
hiss
its
snap
of
sound
and
sometimes
like
the
crack
of
a
ball
on
a
cricket
bat
broke
through
the
thickets
they
separated
spreading
like
beaters
in
a
long
line
soon
trenchard
told
me
i
was
quite
alone
i
could
hear
sometimes
the
breaking
of
a
twig
or
a
stumbling
footfall
but
i
might
have
been
alone
at
the
end
of
the
world
it
was
obvious
that
the
regimental
sanitars
had
been
there
before
us
because
there
were
many
new
roughly
made
graves
there
were
letters
too
and
post
cards
lying
about
all
heavy
with
wet
and
dirt
i
picked
up
some
of
these
letters
from
lovers
and
sisters
and
brothers
one
letter
i
remember
in
a
large
from
a
boy
to
his
father
telling
him
about
his
lessons
and
his
drill
he
would
soon
be
a
soldier
one
letter
too
from
a
girl
to
her
lover
saying
that
she
had
had
a
dream
and
knew
now
that
her
franz
whom
she
loved
with
all
her
soul
would
return
to
her
i
am
quite
confident
now
that
we
shall
be
happy
here
again
very
soon
in
such
a
place
those
words
as
he
walked
alone
there
he
felt
as
i
had
felt
before
the
battle
of
s
that
he
had
already
been
there
he
knew
those
trees
that
smell
that
heavy
overhanging
sky
then
he
remembered
as
i
had
remembered
his
dream
but
whereas
that
dream
had
been
to
me
only
a
reflected
story
with
him
it
had
lasted
throughout
his
life
he
knew
every
step
of
that
first
advance
into
the
forest
the
look
back
to
the
long
dim
white
house
with
shadowy
figures
still
about
it
the
avenue
with
many
trees
the
horses
and
dogs
down
the
first
grey
path
then
the
sudden
loneliness
the
quiet
broken
only
by
the
dripping
of
the
trees
always
that
had
caught
him
by
the
throat
with
terror
and
now
he
was
caught
once
again
he
was
watched
he
fancied
that
he
could
see
the
eyes
behind
the
thicket
and
hear
the
rustling
movement
of
somebody
he
could
hear
nothing
if
at
last
his
dream
was
to
be
fashioned
into
reality
let
it
be
so
did
the
creature
wish
to
destroy
him
let
it
be
so
he
had
no
strength
no
hope
no
desire
it
was
there
he
told
me
when
i
scarcely
knew
what
was
real
and
what
was
not
that
i
saw
that
for
which
i
was
searching
i
noticed
first
the
dark
of
the
trousers
then
the
white
skull
there
was
a
horrible
stench
in
the
air
i
called
and
the
sanitars
answered
me
then
i
looked
at
it
i
had
never
seen
a
dead
man
before
this
man
had
been
dead
for
about
a
fortnight
i
suppose
its
trousers
and
thick
boots
were
in
excellent
condition
and
a
tin
spoon
and
some
papers
were
showing
out
of
the
top
of
one
boot
its
face
was
a
grinning
skull
and
little
black
animals
like
ants
were
climbing
in
and
out
of
the
mouth
and
the
its
jacket
was
in
good
condition
its
arms
were
flung
out
beyond
its
head
i
felt
sick
and
the
whole
place
was
so
damp
and
smelt
so
badly
that
it
must
have
been
horribly
unhealthy
the
sanitars
began
to
dig
a
grave
those
who
were
not
working
smoked
cigarettes
and
they
all
stood
in
a
group
watching
the
body
with
a
solemn
and
serious
interest
one
of
them
made
a
little
wooden
cross
out
of
some
twigs
there
was
a
letter
just
beside
the
body
which
they
brought
me
it
began
heinrich
your
last
letter
was
so
cheerful
that
i
have
quite
recovered
from
my
depression
it
may
not
be
so
long
now
before
and
so
on
like
the
other
letters
that
i
had
read
it
grinned
at
us
there
with
a
devilish
sarcasm
but
its
trousers
and
boots
were
pitiful
and
human
the
men
finished
the
grave
and
then
with
their
feet
turned
it
over
as
it
rolled
a
flood
of
bright
yellow
insects
swarmed
out
of
its
jacket
and
a
grey
liquid
trickled
out
of
the
skull
the
last
i
saw
of
it
was
the
gleam
of
the
tin
spoon
above
its
boot
we
searched
after
that
he
told
me
for
several
hours
and
found
three
more
bodies
they
were
austrians
in
the
condition
of
the
first
i
walked
in
a
dream
of
horror
it
was
i
suppose
a
bad
day
for
me
to
have
come
with
my
other
unhappiness
weighing
upon
me
but
i
was
in
some
stupid
way
altogether
unprepared
for
what
i
had
seen
i
had
as
i
have
told
you
thought
of
death
very
often
in
my
life
but
i
had
never
thought
of
it
like
this
i
did
not
now
think
of
death
very
clearly
but
only
of
the
uselessness
of
trying
to
bear
up
against
anything
when
that
was
all
one
came
to
in
the
end
i
felt
my
very
bones
crumble
and
my
flesh
decay
on
my
body
as
i
stood
there
i
felt
as
though
i
had
really
been
caught
at
last
after
a
silly
aimless
flight
and
that
even
if
i
had
the
strength
or
cleverness
to
escape
i
had
not
the
desire
to
try
i
had
been
mocked
with
a
week
happiness
only
to
have
it
taken
from
me
for
my
enemy
ironic
enjoyment
i
had
a
quite
definite
consciousness
of
my
enemy
i
had
as
a
boy
thought
you
remember
of
my
uncle
and
now
as
i
moved
through
the
wood
i
could
hear
the
old
man
chuckle
just
as
he
had
chuckled
in
the
old
days
snapping
his
fingers
together
and
twitching
his
nose
they
searched
the
wood
until
late
in
the
afternoon
trampling
through
the
wet
peering
through
thickets
listening
for
one
another
voices
finding
sometimes
a
trophy
in
the
shape
of
an
empty
shrapnel
case
an
austrian
cap
or
dagger
then
quite
suddenly
a
sanitar
noticed
that
the
bursting
of
the
shrapnel
was
much
closer
than
it
had
been
during
the
early
afternoon
it
was
now
indeed
very
near
and
they
could
sometimes
see
the
flash
of
fire
between
the
trees
there
something
strange
about
this
your
honour
said
one
of
the
sanitars
nervously
and
they
all
looked
at
trenchard
as
though
it
were
his
fault
that
they
were
there
then
close
behind
them
with
a
snap
of
rage
a
shrapnel
broke
amongst
the
trees
after
that
they
turned
for
home
without
a
word
to
one
another
not
running
but
hastening
with
flushed
faces
as
though
some
one
were
behind
them
they
came
to
the
trench
and
to
their
surprise
found
it
absolutely
deserted
then
plunging
on
they
arrived
at
the
two
wagons
climbed
on
to
one
of
them
leaving
trenchard
alone
with
the
driver
on
the
other
i
tell
you
he
remarked
to
me
afterwards
i
sank
into
that
wagon
as
though
into
my
grave
i
do
know
that
ever
before
or
since
in
my
life
have
i
felt
such
exhaustion
it
was
reaction
i
suppose
a
miserable
wretched
exhaustion
that
left
me
well
enough
aware
that
i
was
the
most
unhappy
of
men
and
simply
forced
me
without
a
protest
to
accept
that
condition
moreover
i
had
always
before
me
the
vision
of
the
dead
body
wherever
i
turned
there
it
was
grinning
at
me
the
black
flies
crawling
in
and
out
of
its
jaws
and
behind
it
something
that
said
to
me
now
i
have
shown
you
what
i
can
do
to
that
you
he
must
have
slept
because
he
was
suddenly
conscious
of
sitting
up
in
his
car
surrounded
by
an
intense
stillness
he
looked
about
him
but
could
see
nothing
clearly
as
though
he
were
still
sleeping
then
he
was
aware
of
a
sanitar
standing
below
the
cart
looking
up
at
him
with
great
agitation
and
saying
again
and
again
moi
borjé
moi
borjé
moi
what
is
it
he
asked
rubbing
his
eyes
the
sanitar
then
seemed
to
slip
away
leaving
him
alone
with
a
vague
sense
of
disaster
the
sun
had
set
but
there
was
a
moon
full
and
high
and
now
by
its
light
he
could
see
that
his
wagon
was
standing
outside
the
gate
of
the
house
at
m
there
was
the
yard
the
the
long
faded
wall
of
the
house
the
barn
but
where
where
he
sat
up
then
jumped
down
on
to
the
road
the
big
white
tent
on
the
further
side
of
the
yard
the
tent
that
had
that
very
morning
been
full
of
wounded
was
gone
the
lines
of
wagons
horses
and
tents
that
had
filled
the
field
across
the
road
were
gone
no
voices
came
from
the
house
somewhere
a
door
banged
persistently
other
sound
there
was
none
the
sanitars
then
surrounded
him
speaking
all
together
waving
their
arms
their
faces
white
under
the
moon
their
eyes
large
and
frightened
like
the
eyes
of
little
children
he
tried
to
push
their
babel
off
from
him
he
could
not
understand
was
this
a
continuation
of
the
nightmare
of
the
afternoon
there
was
a
roar
just
behind
their
ears
as
it
seemed
they
saw
a
light
flash
upon
the
sky
and
fade
flash
again
and
fade
with
their
faces
towards
the
horizon
they
watched
what
is
it
trenchard
said
at
last
there
advanced
towards
him
then
from
out
of
the
empty
house
an
old
man
in
a
wide
straw
hat
with
a
broom
what
is
it
trenchard
said
again
it
the
austrians
said
the
old
man
in
polish
of
which
trenchard
understood
very
little
first
it
the
russians
then
it
the
austrians
then
it
the
russians
then
it
the
austrians
and
always
between
each
of
them
i
have
to
clean
things
up
and
some
more
which
trenchard
did
not
understand
the
old
man
then
stood
at
his
gate
watching
them
with
a
gaze
serious
sad
reflective
meanwhile
the
sanitars
had
discovered
one
of
our
own
soldiers
this
man
who
had
been
sitting
under
a
hedge
and
listening
to
the
austrian
cannon
with
very
uncomfortable
feelings
told
them
of
the
affair
at
three
that
afternoon
our
otriad
had
been
informed
that
it
must
retreat
within
half
an
hour
not
only
our
own
division
but
the
whole
of
the
ninth
army
was
retreating
within
half
an
hour
moreover
the
austrians
were
advancing
a
verst
a
minute
by
four
the
whole
of
our
otriad
had
disappeared
leaving
only
this
soldier
to
inform
us
that
we
must
move
on
at
once
to
t
or
s
twenty
or
thirty
versts
distant
retreating
cried
trenchard
but
we
were
winning
we
just
won
a
battle
totchno
said
the
soldier
gravely
twenty
versts
the
horses
wo
do
it
your
honour
they
got
to
do
it
said
trenchard
sharply
and
the
echo
of
the
austrian
cannon
again
as
it
seemed
quite
close
at
hand
emphasised
his
words
except
for
this
the
silence
of
the
world
around
them
was
eerie
only
far
away
they
seemed
to
hear
the
persistent
rumble
of
carts
on
the
road
they
gone
they
all
gone
we
left
last
of
all
and
the
austrians
advancing
a
verst
a
minute
he
took
a
last
look
at
the
house
which
had
seemed
yesterday
so
absolutely
to
belong
to
them
and
now
was
already
making
preparations
for
its
new
guests
as
he
gazed
he
thought
of
his
agony
in
that
field
below
the
house
only
last
night
and
now
what
years
ago
it
seemed
what
years
what
years
ago
he
climbed
wearily
again
upon
his
wagon
there
had
entered
into
his
unhappiness
now
a
new
element
this
was
a
sensation
of
cold
despairing
anger
that
ground
should
be
yielded
so
helplessly
about
every
field
every
hedge
and
lane
and
tree
as
slowly
they
jogged
along
he
felt
this
only
this
corn
these
stones
these
flowers
were
russian
and
austrian
this
as
it
seemed
simply
out
of
the
air
dictated
by
some
whispering
devil
crouching
behind
a
hedge
afraid
to
appear
this
too
when
only
a
few
hours
ago
there
had
been
that
battle
of
s
won
by
them
after
a
struggle
of
many
days
that
position
soaked
with
russian
blood
to
be
surrendered
now
as
a
leaf
blows
in
the
wind
when
they
arrived
at
t
and
found
our
otriad
he
was
i
believe
so
deeply
exhausted
that
he
was
not
conscious
of
his
actions
his
account
to
me
of
what
then
occurred
is
fantastic
and
confused
he
discovered
apparently
the
house
where
we
were
it
was
then
one
in
the
morning
every
one
was
asleep
there
seemed
to
be
no
place
for
him
to
be
he
could
find
neither
candles
nor
matches
and
he
wandered
out
into
the
road
again
then
it
seems
he
was
standing
beside
a
deep
lake
i
can
remember
nothing
clearly
except
that
the
lake
was
black
and
endless
i
stood
looking
at
it
i
could
see
the
bodies
out
of
the
forest
only
now
they
were
slipping
along
the
water
their
skulls
white
and
gleaming
i
had
also
a
confused
impression
that
russia
was
beaten
and
the
war
over
and
that
for
me
too
life
was
utterly
at
an
end
i
remember
that
i
deliberately
thought
of
marie
because
it
hurt
so
abominably
i
repeated
to
myself
the
incidents
of
the
night
before
all
of
them
talking
aloud
to
myself
i
decided
then
that
i
would
drown
myself
in
the
lake
it
seemed
the
only
thing
to
do
i
took
my
coat
off
then
sat
down
in
the
mud
and
took
off
my
boots
why
i
did
this
i
do
know
i
looked
at
the
water
thought
that
it
would
be
cold
but
that
it
would
soon
be
over
because
i
could
swim
i
heard
the
frogs
looked
back
at
the
flickering
fires
amongst
our
wagons
then
walked
down
the
bank
nikitin
must
for
some
time
have
been
watching
him
because
at
that
moment
he
stepped
forward
took
trenchard
arm
and
drew
him
back
nikitin
has
himself
told
me
that
he
was
walking
up
and
down
the
road
that
night
because
he
could
not
sleep
when
he
spoke
to
trenchard
the
man
seemed
dazed
and
bewildered
said
something
about
life
being
all
over
for
him
and
death
being
horrible
nikitin
put
his
arm
round
him
took
him
back
to
his
room
where
he
made
him
a
bed
on
the
floor
gave
him
a
and
watched
him
until
he
slept
that
was
the
true
beginning
of
the
friendship
between
nikitin
and
trenchard
chapter
vi
the
retreat
the
retreat
struck
us
as
breathlessly
as
though
we
had
been
whirled
by
a
into
midair
on
the
afternoon
of
a
summer
day
at
five
minutes
to
three
we
had
been
sitting
round
the
table
in
the
garden
of
the
house
at
m
drinking
tea
we
were
i
remember
very
gay
we
had
heard
only
the
day
before
of
the
russian
surrender
of
przemysl
and
that
had
for
a
moment
depressed
us
but
as
always
we
could
see
very
little
beyond
our
own
immediate
division
here
on
our
own
front
we
had
at
last
cleared
the
path
before
us
on
that
very
afternoon
we
were
gaily
anticipating
our
advance
even
sister
k
who
for
religious
reasons
took
always
a
gloomy
view
of
the
future
was
cheerful
she
sipped
her
cherry
jam
and
smiled
upon
us
anna
petrovna
imperturbably
sewing
calmly
sighed
her
satisfaction
perhaps
we
shall
move
i
feel
like
it
it
will
be
splendid
to
go
through
the
carpathians
beautiful
scenery
i
believe
molozov
was
absent
in
the
town
of
b
collecting
some
wagons
that
had
arrived
from
petrograd
he
be
back
i
believe
said
sister
k
dear
me
what
a
pleasant
afternoon
it
was
then
that
i
saw
the
face
of
the
boy
goga
i
had
turned
smiling
pleased
with
the
sunshine
cherry
jam
and
a
good
russian
cigarette
straight
from
petrograd
the
boy
goga
stared
across
the
yard
at
me
his
round
red
cheeks
pale
mouth
open
and
his
eyes
confused
and
unbelieving
he
seemed
then
to
jump
across
the
intervening
space
then
he
screamed
at
us
we
retreating
we
retreating
he
shrieked
in
the
high
trembling
voice
peculiar
to
agitated
russians
we
have
only
half
an
hour
and
the
austrians
are
almost
here
now
we
were
flung
after
that
into
a
hurry
of
movement
that
left
us
no
time
for
reasoning
or
argument
semyonov
appeared
and
in
molozov
absence
took
the
lead
he
was
of
course
entirely
unmoved
and
as
i
now
remember
combed
his
fair
beard
with
a
little
tortoiseshell
pocket
comb
as
he
talked
to
us
yes
we
must
move
in
half
an
hour
very
sad
the
whole
army
is
retreating
why
god
knows
there
arose
clouds
of
dust
in
the
yard
where
we
had
had
our
happy
luncheon
the
tents
had
disappeared
the
wounded
were
once
more
lying
on
the
jolting
carts
looking
up
through
their
pain
and
distress
to
a
heaven
that
was
hot
and
grey
and
indifferent
an
old
man
whom
we
had
not
seen
during
the
whole
of
our
stay
suddenly
appeared
from
nowhere
with
a
long
broom
and
watched
us
complacently
we
had
our
own
private
property
to
pack
as
i
pressed
my
last
things
into
my
bag
i
turned
from
my
desolate
little
tent
looked
over
the
fields
the
garden
the
house
the
barns
but
it
was
ours
ours
i
thought
passionately
we
had
but
just
now
won
a
battle
across
the
long
purple
misty
fields
the
bodies
of
those
fallen
russians
seemed
to
rise
and
reproach
us
we
had
won
that
land
for
you
and
now
like
this
you
can
abandon
us
at
that
moment
i
cursed
my
lameness
that
would
prevent
me
from
ever
being
a
soldier
how
poor
on
that
afternoon
it
seemed
to
be
unable
to
defend
with
one
own
hand
those
fields
those
rivers
those
hills
ah
but
russia
i
will
serve
you
faithfully
for
this
was
the
prayer
at
all
our
hearts
that
afternoon
semyonov
had
wisely
directed
our
little
procession
away
from
the
main
road
to
o
which
was
filled
now
with
the
carts
and
wagons
of
our
division
we
were
to
spend
the
night
at
the
small
village
of
t
twenty
versts
distant
then
morning
to
arrive
at
o
the
carts
were
waiting
in
a
long
line
down
the
road
the
soldiers
hot
and
dusty
carried
bags
and
sacks
and
bundles
a
wounded
man
cried
suddenly
oh
oh
oh
an
ugly
mongrel
terrier
who
had
attached
himself
to
our
otriad
tried
to
leap
up
at
him
barking
in
the
air
there
was
a
scent
of
hay
and
dust
and
flowers
and
very
faintly
behind
it
all
came
the
soft
gentle
rumble
of
the
austrian
cannon
nikitin
splendid
on
his
horse
shouted
to
semyonov
what
of
had
some
one
better
go
to
meet
him
i
arranged
that
semyonov
answered
shortly
it
was
of
course
my
fate
to
travel
in
the
ancient
black
carriage
that
was
one
of
the
glories
of
our
otriad
with
sister
sofia
antonovna
the
sister
with
the
small
eyes
of
whom
i
have
spoken
on
an
earlier
page
she
was
a
woman
who
found
in
every
arrangement
in
life
whether
made
by
god
the
germans
or
the
general
of
our
division
much
cause
for
complaint
and
dismay
she
had
never
been
pretty
but
had
always
felt
that
she
ought
to
be
she
was
stupid
but
comforted
herself
by
the
certain
assurance
that
every
one
else
was
stupid
too
she
had
come
to
the
war
because
a
large
family
of
brothers
and
sisters
refused
to
have
her
at
home
i
disliked
her
very
much
and
she
hated
myself
and
marie
ivanovna
more
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
i
do
know
why
she
grouped
us
together
she
always
did
marie
ivanovna
was
sitting
with
us
now
in
the
carriage
and
silent
sofia
antonovna
was
very
patronising
when
worked
a
little
more
at
the
front
dear
you
know
that
these
things
must
happen
bad
work
somewhere
of
course
what
can
you
expect
from
a
country
like
russia
everything
mismanaged
nothing
but
thieves
and
robbers
of
course
we
beaten
and
always
will
be
how
can
you
sofia
antonovna
sister
marie
interrupted
in
a
low
trembling
voice
it
is
nobody
fault
it
is
only
for
a
moment
we
will
return
soon
at
once
i
know
it
ah
we
we
and
your
courage
all
goes
of
course
it
would
sister
sofia
antonovna
smiled
and
her
eyes
watched
us
both
afraid
your
will
be
left
behind
she
said
semyonov
marie
ivanovna
began
then
stopped
we
were
all
of
us
silent
during
the
rest
of
the
journey
and
how
is
one
to
give
any
true
picture
of
the
confusion
into
which
we
flung
ourselves
at
o
o
had
been
the
town
at
which
a
little
more
than
a
month
ago
we
had
arrived
so
eagerly
so
optimistically
it
had
been
to
us
then
the
quietest
retreat
in
the
world
irritating
provoking
by
reason
of
its
peace
the
little
the
green
well
the
orchard
the
bees
the
long
light
evenings
with
no
sound
but
the
birds
and
running
water
those
things
had
been
a
month
ago
we
were
hurled
now
into
a
world
of
dust
and
despair
the
square
market
place
the
houses
that
huddled
round
it
were
swallowed
up
by
soldiers
horses
carts
and
whirling
clouds
a
wind
blew
and
through
the
wind
a
hot
sun
blazed
everywhere
horses
were
neighing
cows
and
sheep
were
driven
in
thick
herds
through
columns
of
soldiers
motor
cars
frantically
pushed
their
way
from
place
to
place
and
always
everywhere
covering
every
inch
of
ground
flying
as
it
seemed
from
the
air
on
to
roofs
in
and
out
of
windows
from
house
to
house
from
corner
to
corner
was
the
humorous
pathetic
expectant
dreaming
stolid
russian
soldier
he
was
to
come
to
me
later
on
in
a
very
different
fashion
but
on
this
dreadful
day
in
o
he
was
simply
part
of
the
intolerable
depressing
background
if
this
day
were
dreadful
to
me
what
must
it
have
been
to
trenchard
we
were
none
of
us
aware
at
this
time
of
what
had
happened
to
him
two
days
before
nor
did
we
know
of
his
adventure
of
yesterday
o
seemed
to
him
he
has
told
me
like
hell
we
spent
the
day
gathered
together
in
a
large
white
house
that
had
formerly
been
the
of
o
it
had
i
remember
high
empty
rooms
all
gilt
and
the
windows
were
broken
and
the
dust
came
in
circles
and
twisting
spirals
blowing
over
the
gilt
chairs
and
wooden
floors
we
made
tea
and
sat
miserably
together
semyonov
was
in
some
other
part
of
the
town
we
were
to
wait
here
until
molozov
arrived
from
b
there
can
be
few
things
so
bad
as
the
sense
of
insecurity
that
we
had
that
afternoon
the
very
ground
seemed
to
have
been
cut
away
from
under
our
feet
we
had
gathered
enough
from
the
officers
of
our
division
to
know
that
something
very
disastrous
somewhere
had
occurred
it
was
the
very
vagueness
of
the
thing
that
terrified
us
what
could
have
happened
only
something
very
monstrous
could
have
compelled
so
general
a
retirement
we
might
all
of
us
be
prisoners
before
the
evening
that
seemed
to
us
and
indeed
was
afterwards
proved
in
reality
to
have
been
no
slender
possibility
there
was
no
spot
on
earth
that
belonged
to
us
so
firm
and
solid
we
had
been
at
m
even
we
had
hung
pictures
on
the
walls
and
planted
flowers
outside
the
now
all
that
remained
for
us
was
this
horrible
place
with
its
endless
its
bare
gleaming
floors
and
the
intolerable
noise
through
its
open
windows
of
carts
soldiers
horses
the
smell
of
dung
and
tobacco
and
the
hot
air
like
gas
that
flung
the
dust
into
our
faces
beyond
the
vague
terrors
of
our
uncertainty
was
the
figure
seen
quite
clearly
by
all
of
us
without
any
sentiment
of
russia
certainly
trenchard
and
i
could
feel
with
less
poignancy
the
appeal
of
her
presence
and
yet
i
swear
that
to
us
also
on
that
day
it
was
she
of
whom
we
were
thinking
we
had
been
until
then
her
allies
we
were
now
her
servants
by
russia
every
one
of
us
sitting
in
that
huge
room
meant
something
different
to
goga
she
was
home
a
white
house
on
the
volga
tennis
long
evenings
early
mornings
holidays
in
a
tangled
wilderness
of
happiness
to
sister
k
she
was
holy
russia
russia
of
the
kremlin
of
the
lavra
of
a
million
ikons
in
a
million
little
streets
little
rooms
little
churches
to
sister
sofia
she
was
petrograd
with
cafés
novels
by
such
writers
as
verbitzkaia
and
our
own
jack
london
the
cinematograph
and
the
islands
on
a
fine
evening
in
may
to
the
student
like
a
white
fish
she
was
a
platform
for
frantic
speeches
incipient
revolutions
little
untidy
hysterical
meetings
in
a
dirty
room
in
a
back
street
newspapers
the
incapacities
of
the
douma
the
robberies
and
villainies
of
the
government
to
anna
petrovna
she
was
comfortable
unspeculative
friendly
home
to
nikitin
she
was
the
face
of
one
woman
upon
whose
eyes
his
own
were
always
fixed
to
marie
ivanovna
she
was
a
flaming
glorious
wonder
mystical
transplendent
revealed
in
every
blade
of
grass
every
flash
of
sun
across
the
sky
every
line
of
the
road
the
top
of
every
hill
and
to
trenchard
and
myself
for
trenchard
she
had
perhaps
taken
to
herself
some
part
of
his
beloved
country
he
has
told
me
and
i
will
witness
in
myself
to
the
truth
of
this
that
he
never
in
his
life
felt
more
burningly
his
love
for
england
than
at
this
first
moment
of
his
consciousness
of
russia
the
lanes
and
sea
of
his
remembered
vision
were
not
far
from
that
dirty
disordered
town
in
galicia
and
for
both
of
them
he
was
rendering
his
service
at
any
rate
there
we
sat
huddled
together
reflected
in
the
countless
as
a
helpless
miserable
lot
falling
into
long
silences
hoping
for
the
coming
of
molozov
with
later
news
listening
to
the
confusion
in
the
street
below
marie
ivanovna
with
her
hands
behind
her
back
and
her
head
up
walked
nervously
up
and
down
the
long
room
her
eyes
stared
beyond
us
and
the
place
striving
perhaps
to
find
some
reason
why
life
should
so
continually
insist
on
being
a
different
thing
from
her
imaginings
of
it
lighted
by
the
hot
sun
blown
upon
by
the
dust
her
figure
tall
thin
swaying
a
little
in
its
many
reflections
had
the
determined
valour
of
some
joan
of
arc
but
joan
of
arc
i
thought
to
myself
had
at
least
some
one
definite
against
whom
to
wave
her
white
banner
we
were
fighting
dust
and
the
sun
trenchard
and
nikitin
had
left
us
to
go
into
the
town
to
search
for
news
we
were
silent
suddenly
marie
ivanovna
turning
upon
us
all
as
though
she
hated
us
cried
fiercely
i
think
you
should
know
that
trenchard
and
i
are
no
longer
engaged
it
was
neither
the
time
nor
the
place
for
such
a
declaration
i
can
not
suggest
why
marie
ivanovna
spoke
unless
it
were
that
she
felt
life
that
was
betraying
her
so
basely
that
she
herself
at
least
must
be
honest
we
none
of
us
knew
what
to
say
what
we
say
this
appalling
day
had
sunk
for
us
all
individualities
we
were
scarcely
aware
of
one
another
names
and
here
was
marie
ivanovna
thrusting
all
these
personalities
upon
us
sister
sofia
eyes
glittered
with
pleasure
but
she
only
said
oh
dear
i
very
sorry
sister
k
who
was
always
without
tact
made
a
most
uncomfortable
remark
poor
that
i
believe
was
what
we
were
all
feeling
i
had
an
impulse
to
run
out
into
the
street
find
trenchard
and
make
him
comfortable
i
felt
furiously
indignant
with
the
girl
we
all
looked
at
her
i
suppose
with
indignation
because
she
regarded
us
with
a
fierce
insulting
smile
then
turned
her
back
upon
us
and
went
to
a
window
at
that
moment
molozov
with
trenchard
nikitin
and
semyonov
entered
i
have
said
earlier
in
this
book
that
only
upon
one
occasion
have
i
seen
molozov
utterly
overcome
a
defeated
man
this
was
the
occasion
to
which
i
refer
he
stood
there
in
the
doorway
under
a
vulgar
bevy
of
gilt
and
crimson
cupids
his
face
dull
paste
in
colour
his
hands
hanging
like
lead
he
looked
at
us
without
seeing
us
semyonov
said
something
to
him
why
of
course
i
heard
him
reply
we
got
to
get
out
as
quickly
as
we
can
that
all
he
came
over
towards
us
and
we
were
all
except
marie
ivanovna
desperately
frightened
she
cried
to
him
well
what
the
truth
how
bad
is
it
he
did
turn
to
her
but
answered
to
us
all
it
abominable
everywhere
i
know
that
then
the
great
feeling
of
us
all
was
that
we
must
escape
from
the
horrible
place
in
some
way
this
beastly
town
of
o
once
cursed
by
us
for
its
gentle
placidity
was
responsible
for
the
whole
disaster
it
was
as
though
we
said
to
ourselves
if
we
had
not
been
here
this
would
not
have
happened
we
all
stood
up
as
though
we
felt
that
we
must
leave
at
once
and
while
we
stood
thus
there
was
a
report
that
shook
the
floor
so
that
we
rocked
on
our
feet
brought
a
shower
of
dust
and
whitewash
from
the
walls
cracked
the
one
remaining
pane
of
glass
and
drove
two
mice
scattering
with
terror
wildly
across
the
floor
the
noise
had
been
terrific
our
very
hearts
stood
still
the
austrians
were
here
then
this
was
the
end
it
the
bridge
semyonov
said
quietly
and
of
course
ironically
we
blown
it
up
there
be
the
other
in
a
moment
there
was
a
second
shock
brought
down
more
dust
and
a
large
scale
of
gilt
wood
from
one
of
the
cornices
we
waited
then
for
our
orders
looking
down
from
the
windows
on
to
what
seemed
a
perfect
babel
of
disorder
and
confusion
we
must
be
at
x
molozov
told
us
the
staff
is
on
its
way
already
we
should
be
moving
in
half
an
hour
we
made
our
preparations
trenchard
meanwhile
had
had
during
this
afternoon
one
driving
compelling
impulse
beyond
all
others
that
he
must
at
all
costs
escape
all
personal
contact
with
marie
ivanovna
it
seemed
to
him
the
most
awful
thing
that
could
possibly
happen
to
him
now
would
be
a
compulsory
conversation
with
her
he
did
not
of
course
know
that
she
had
spoken
to
us
and
he
thought
that
it
would
be
the
easiest
thing
in
all
the
confusion
that
this
retreat
involved
that
he
should
be
flung
up
against
her
he
sought
his
chief
refuge
in
nikitin
i
am
aware
that
in
the
things
i
have
said
of
nikitin
in
speaking
both
of
his
relation
to
andrey
vassilievitch
wife
and
to
trenchard
himself
i
have
shown
him
as
something
of
a
sentimental
figure
and
yet
sentimental
was
the
very
last
thing
that
he
really
was
he
had
not
the
that
is
commonly
asserted
to
be
the
chief
glory
and
the
chief
defect
of
the
russian
soul
he
had
talked
to
me
because
i
was
a
foreigner
and
of
no
importance
to
him
some
one
who
would
be
entirely
outside
his
life
he
took
trenchard
now
for
his
friend
i
believe
because
he
really
was
attracted
by
the
admixture
of
chivalry
and
helplessness
of
simplicity
and
credulity
of
timidity
and
courage
that
the
man
character
displayed
i
am
sure
that
had
it
been
i
who
had
been
in
trenchard
position
he
would
not
have
stretched
out
one
finger
to
help
me
trenchard
himself
had
only
vague
memories
of
the
events
of
the
preceding
evening
he
was
aware
quite
simply
that
the
whole
thing
had
been
a
horrible
dream
and
that
nothing
so
bad
could
ever
possibly
happen
to
him
again
he
had
touched
the
worst
and
he
undoubtedly
found
some
relief
in
the
general
distress
and
confusion
it
covered
his
personal
disaster
and
forced
him
to
forget
himself
in
other
persons
misfortunes
he
was
as
it
happened
of
more
use
than
any
one
just
then
in
getting
every
one
speedily
out
of
o
he
ran
messages
found
parcels
and
bags
for
the
sisters
collected
sanitars
even
discovered
the
mongrel
terrier
tied
a
string
to
him
and
gave
him
to
one
of
our
soldiers
to
look
after
in
what
a
confusion
as
the
evening
fell
was
the
garden
of
our
large
white
house
huge
wagons
covered
its
lawn
horses
neighing
stamping
jumping
were
dragged
and
pulled
and
threatened
officers
from
stout
colonels
to
very
young
lieutenants
came
cursing
and
shouting
first
this
way
and
that
a
huge
bag
of
biscuits
broke
away
from
a
provision
van
and
fell
scattering
on
to
the
ground
the
soldiers
told
that
they
might
help
themselves
laughing
and
shouting
like
babies
fell
upon
the
store
but
for
the
most
part
there
was
gloom
gloom
gloom
under
the
evening
sky
sometimes
the
reflections
of
distant
rockets
would
shudder
and
fade
across
the
pale
blue
incessantly
from
every
corner
of
the
world
came
the
screaming
rattle
of
carts
a
sound
like
many
pencils
drawn
across
a
gigantic
slate
and
always
the
dust
rose
and
fell
in
webs
and
curtains
of
filmy
gold
under
the
evening
sun
at
last
trenchard
found
himself
with
molozov
and
ivan
mihailovitch
the
student
like
a
fish
in
the
old
black
carriage
molozov
had
flung
the
world
to
the
devil
trenchard
afterwards
said
and
i
sat
there
you
know
looking
at
his
white
face
and
wondering
what
i
ought
to
talk
about
trenchard
suddenly
found
himself
narrowly
and
aggressively
english
and
it
is
certain
that
every
englishman
in
russia
on
tuesday
thanks
god
that
he
is
a
practical
man
and
has
some
common
sense
and
on
wednesday
wonders
whether
any
one
in
england
knows
the
true
value
of
anything
at
all
and
is
ashamed
of
a
country
so
miserably
without
a
passion
for
ideas
trenchard
was
an
englishman
he
had
been
really
useful
at
o
and
he
had
felt
a
new
spirit
of
kindness
around
him
he
did
not
know
that
marie
ivanovna
had
made
her
declaration
to
us
and
that
we
were
therefore
all
anxious
to
show
him
that
we
thought
that
he
had
been
badly
treated
moreover
he
suspected
with
a
true
english
distrust
of
emotions
that
the
russians
before
him
were
inclined
to
luxuriate
in
their
gloom
molozov
despair
and
ivan
passionate
eyes
and
jerking
white
hands
irritated
him
he
smiled
a
practical
english
smile
and
looked
about
him
at
the
swaying
procession
of
carts
and
soldiers
with
a
practical
eye
come
he
said
to
molozov
do
despair
there
nothing
really
to
be
distressed
about
there
be
these
retreats
you
know
there
be
the
great
thing
in
this
war
is
to
see
the
whole
thing
in
proportion
the
thing
france
and
england
and
the
dardanelles
and
italy
in
another
month
or
two
but
molozov
frowning
shook
his
head
this
country
no
method
no
system
it
is
terrible
a
pretty
girl
he
added
moodily
looking
at
a
group
of
peasants
in
a
doorway
a
pretty
girl
he
added
sitting
up
a
little
and
staring
then
he
relapsed
no
system
he
murmured
but
there
be
continued
trenchard
in
his
english
voice
he
told
me
afterwards
that
he
was
conscious
at
the
time
of
a
horrible
priggish
superiority
here
in
russia
you
go
up
and
down
so
no
restraint
now
if
you
had
discipline
but
he
was
interrupted
by
the
melancholy
figure
of
an
officer
who
hung
on
to
our
slowly
moving
carriage
walking
beside
it
with
his
hand
on
the
door
he
did
not
seem
to
have
anything
very
much
to
say
but
looked
at
us
with
large
melancholy
eyes
he
was
small
and
needed
dusting
what
is
it
asked
molozov
saluting
i
had
contusion
said
the
little
officer
in
a
dreamy
voice
contusion
i
do
feel
very
well
i
do
quite
know
where
i
ought
to
go
our
doctors
are
just
behind
said
molozov
you
can
come
on
with
them
your
doctors
the
little
officer
repeated
dreamily
very
well
but
he
continued
with
us
i
had
contusion
he
said
at
m
yes
and
now
i
do
quite
know
where
i
am
i
very
depressed
and
unhappy
what
do
you
advise
there
are
our
doctors
molozov
repeated
rather
irritably
find
them
behind
there
yes
i
suppose
so
the
melancholy
little
figure
repeated
and
disappeared
in
some
way
this
figure
affected
trenchard
very
dismally
and
drove
all
his
english
common
sense
away
we
were
moving
now
slowly
through
clouds
of
dust
and
peasants
who
watched
us
from
their
doorways
with
a
cold
indifference
that
was
worse
than
exultation
when
we
arrived
at
two
or
three
in
the
morning
at
x
our
destination
the
spirits
of
all
of
us
were
heavily
weighted
tired
cross
dirty
driven
and
pursued
and
always
with
us
that
harassing
fear
that
we
had
now
no
ground
upon
which
we
might
rest
our
feet
that
nothing
in
the
world
belonged
to
us
that
we
were
fugitives
and
vagabonds
by
the
will
of
god
as
our
carriage
stopped
before
the
door
of
the
large
white
building
in
x
that
seemed
just
like
the
large
white
building
in
o
the
little
officer
was
again
at
our
side
i
got
contusion
he
said
i
very
unhappy
and
i
do
know
where
to
go
trenchard
felt
now
as
though
in
another
moment
he
would
tumble
back
again
into
his
nightmare
of
yesterday
the
house
at
x
indeed
was
fantastic
enough
i
feel
that
i
am
in
danger
of
giving
too
many
descriptions
of
our
various
for
the
most
part
they
largely
resembled
one
another
large
deserted
country
houses
with
broken
windows
bare
walls
and
floors
a
tangled
garden
and
a
tattered
collection
of
books
in
the
polish
language
but
this
building
at
x
was
like
no
other
of
our
asylums
it
was
a
huge
place
a
strange
combination
of
the
local
and
the
local
theatre
it
was
the
theatre
that
at
that
early
hour
in
the
morning
seemed
to
our
weary
eyes
so
fantastic
as
we
peered
into
it
it
was
a
huge
place
already
filled
with
wounded
and
lighted
only
by
candles
stuck
here
and
there
in
bottles
i
could
see
dimly
the
stage
at
the
back
of
the
room
and
still
hanging
tattered
and
restless
in
the
draught
a
forgotten
backcloth
of
some
old
play
i
could
see
that
it
was
a
picture
of
a
gay
scene
in
an
impossibly
highly
coloured
town
high
marble
stairs
down
which
with
swollen
legs
came
tripping
into
a
filled
with
soldiers
and
their
lovers
carmen
perhaps
it
seemed
absurd
enough
there
in
the
uncertain
candlelight
with
the
wounded
groaning
and
crying
in
front
of
it
there
was
already
in
the
air
that
familiar
smell
of
blood
and
iodine
the
familiar
cries
of
oh
oh
the
familiar
patient
faces
of
the
soldiers
sitting
up
waiting
for
their
turn
the
familiar
sharp
voice
of
the
sanitar
what
division
what
regiment
bullet
or
shrapnel
i
remember
that
some
wounded
man
in
high
fever
was
singing
and
that
no
one
could
stop
him
he
dead
i
heard
semyonov
curt
voice
behind
me
and
turning
saw
them
cover
the
body
on
the
stretcher
with
a
sheet
oh
oh
oh
oh
shrieked
a
man
from
the
middle
of
whose
back
nikitin
probing
with
his
finger
was
extracting
a
bullet
the
candles
flared
the
ladies
from
carmen
wavered
on
the
marble
steps
the
high
cracked
voice
of
the
soldier
continued
its
song
i
stood
there
with
trenchard
and
andrey
vassilievitch
then
we
turned
away
we
not
wanted
i
said
we
better
get
out
of
the
way
and
sleep
somewhere
there
be
plenty
to
do
little
andrey
vassilievitch
whom
during
the
retreat
i
had
entirely
forgotten
looked
very
pathetic
he
was
dusty
and
dirty
and
hated
his
discomfort
he
did
not
know
where
to
go
and
was
in
everybody
way
nikitin
was
immensely
busy
and
had
no
time
to
waste
on
his
friend
poor
andrey
was
tired
and
terribly
depressed
what
i
say
is
he
confided
to
us
in
a
voice
that
trembled
a
little
that
we
are
not
to
despair
we
have
to
retreat
but
who
knows
what
will
happen
every
one
is
aware
that
russia
is
a
glorious
country
and
has
endless
resources
well
then
what
i
say
is
an
officer
bundled
into
him
apologised
but
quite
obviously
cursed
him
for
being
in
the
way
come
along
said
trenchard
putting
his
arm
on
andrey
vassilievitch
sleeve
we
find
somewhere
to
sleep
of
course
we
not
in
despair
why
should
we
be
you
feel
better
they
departed
and
as
they
went
i
wondered
at
this
new
side
in
trenchard
character
he
seemed
strong
practical
and
almost
cheerful
i
knowing
his
disaster
was
puzzled
my
lame
leg
was
hurting
me
i
found
a
corner
to
lie
down
in
rolled
myself
in
my
greatcoat
and
passed
through
a
strange
succession
of
fantastic
dreams
in
which
trenchard
marie
ivanovna
nikitin
and
semyonov
all
figured
behind
them
i
seemed
to
hear
some
voice
crying
i
got
you
all
i
got
you
all
you
caught
you
caught
you
caught
on
the
following
day
there
happened
to
trenchard
the
thing
that
he
had
dreaded
writing
of
it
now
i
can
not
disentangle
it
from
the
circumstances
and
surroundings
of
his
account
of
it
to
me
he
was
looking
back
then
when
he
spoke
to
me
to
something
that
seemed
almost
fantastic
in
its
ironical
reality
every
word
of
that
conversation
he
afterwards
recalled
to
himself
again
and
again
as
to
marie
ivanovna
i
think
that
he
never
even
began
to
understand
her
that
he
should
believe
in
her
was
a
different
matter
from
his
understanding
her
that
he
should
worship
her
was
a
tribute
both
to
his
inexperience
and
to
his
sentiment
but
his
relation
to
her
and
to
this
whole
adventure
of
his
was
confused
and
complicated
by
the
fact
that
he
was
not
i
believe
in
himself
a
sentimental
man
what
one
supposed
to
be
sentiment
was
a
quite
honest
and
naked
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
world
as
experience
came
to
him
sentiment
fell
away
from
him
but
experience
was
never
to
come
to
him
in
regard
to
marie
ivanovna
he
was
to
know
as
little
of
her
at
the
end
as
he
had
known
at
the
beginning
and
this
whole
conversation
with
her
of
course
i
have
only
his
report
of
it
is
clouded
with
his
romantic
conception
of
her
to
that
i
might
add
also
my
own
romantic
conception
if
trenchard
never
saw
her
clearly
because
he
loved
her
i
never
saw
her
clearly
because
because
why
i
do
not
know
she
was
from
first
to
last
a
figure
of
romance
irritating
aggressive
enchanting
baffling
always
blinding
to
all
of
us
during
the
morning
after
our
arrival
in
m
trenchard
worked
in
the
theatre
bandaging
and
helping
with
the
transport
of
the
wounded
up
the
high
and
difficult
staircase
then
at
midday
tired
with
the
heat
the
closeness
of
the
place
he
escaped
into
the
little
park
that
bordered
the
farther
side
of
the
road
it
was
a
burning
day
in
june
the
sun
came
beating
through
the
trees
and
as
soon
as
he
had
turned
the
corner
of
the
path
and
had
lost
the
line
of
ruined
and
blackened
houses
to
his
right
he
found
himself
in
the
wildest
and
most
glittering
of
little
orchards
the
grass
grew
here
to
a
great
height
the
were
of
a
fine
age
and
the
sun
in
squares
and
circles
and
stars
of
light
flashed
like
fire
through
the
thick
green
he
stepped
forward
blinded
by
the
quivering
gold
and
walked
into
the
arms
of
marie
ivanovna
he
quite
literally
ran
against
her
and
put
his
arms
about
her
for
a
moment
to
steady
her
not
seeing
who
she
was
then
he
gave
a
little
cry
she
was
also
frightened
it
was
the
only
time
he
told
me
that
i
had
ever
seen
her
show
fear
they
were
silent
neither
of
them
knowing
the
way
to
speak
then
she
said
john
do
away
it
is
very
good
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
here
sit
down
here
she
herself
sat
down
and
patted
the
grass
inviting
him
he
at
once
sat
down
beside
her
but
he
could
say
nothing
nothing
at
all
she
waited
for
a
time
and
then
seeing
him
i
suppose
at
a
loss
and
helpless
regained
her
own
courage
are
you
still
angry
with
me
no
he
answered
not
looking
at
her
you
have
a
right
to
be
i
behaved
very
badly
i
do
understand
he
replied
why
you
thought
in
petrograd
that
you
loved
me
and
then
so
soon
found
that
you
did
not
so
soon
he
looked
at
her
and
then
lowered
his
eyes
what
do
you
know
or
i
know
she
suddenly
asked
him
impetuously
are
we
not
both
always
thinking
that
things
will
be
so
fine
and
then
they
are
not
how
could
we
be
happy
together
when
we
are
both
so
ignorant
ah
you
know
john
that
happy
together
we
could
never
be
he
looked
at
her
clearly
and
without
hesitation
i
was
very
stupid
he
said
i
thought
that
because
i
had
come
into
a
big
thing
i
would
be
big
myself
it
is
not
so
i
am
the
same
person
as
i
was
in
england
i
have
not
changed
at
all
and
i
shall
never
change
only
in
this
one
thing
that
whether
you
go
from
me
or
whether
you
stay
i
shall
never
love
anybody
but
you
all
men
say
that
i
know
he
added
but
there
are
not
many
men
who
have
had
so
little
in
their
lives
as
i
and
so
perhaps
it
means
more
with
me
than
it
does
with
others
she
made
no
reply
to
him
she
had
not
i
believe
heard
him
she
said
as
though
she
were
speaking
to
herself
if
we
had
not
come
john
if
we
had
stayed
in
petrograd
anything
might
have
been
but
here
there
is
something
more
than
people
i
do
know
whether
i
love
or
hate
any
one
i
can
not
marry
you
or
any
man
until
this
is
all
over
and
then
he
interrupted
passionately
touching
her
sleeve
with
his
hand
after
the
war
perhaps
again
you
will
she
took
his
hand
in
hers
looking
at
him
as
though
she
were
suddenly
seeing
him
for
the
first
time
no
john
never
in
petrograd
i
did
know
what
this
could
be
no
idea
none
and
now
that
i
here
i
can
think
of
nothing
else
than
what
i
going
to
find
there
is
something
here
that
i
be
afraid
of
if
i
let
myself
be
and
that
what
i
love
what
will
happen
when
i
meet
it
shall
i
feel
fear
or
no
and
so
too
if
there
were
a
man
whom
i
feared
semyonov
trenchard
cried
she
looked
at
him
and
did
not
answer
he
caught
her
hand
urgently
no
marie
no
any
one
but
semyonov
it
does
matter
about
me
but
you
be
happy
you
be
nothing
else
and
he
wo
make
you
he
is
happy
she
answered
scornfully
i
do
want
to
be
happy
is
it
but
to
be
sure
that
one
not
afraid
she
repeated
to
herself
several
times
the
russian
for
bravery
that
is
more
than
you
john
or
than
i
or
than
she
broke
off
looked
at
him
suddenly
as
he
told
me
very
tenderly
and
kindly
as
though
she
liked
me
john
i
your
friend
i
been
bad
to
you
but
i
your
friend
i
do
understand
why
i
been
so
bad
to
you
because
i
would
be
yes
if
any
one
else
were
bad
to
you
and
be
mine
john
whatever
i
do
be
mine
i
not
really
a
bad
character
only
i
think
it
too
exciting
now
here
everything
for
me
to
stop
and
think
you
know
he
answered
with
a
rather
tired
gesture
he
had
worked
in
that
hot
theatre
all
the
morning
that
i
am
always
the
same
but
you
must
not
marry
semyonov
he
added
fiercely
she
did
not
answer
him
looked
up
at
the
sunlight
and
said
after
a
time
i
hate
sister
k
she
is
not
really
religious
she
does
wash
either
let
us
go
back
i
was
away
i
said
only
for
a
little
they
walked
back
he
told
me
in
perfect
silence
he
was
more
unhappy
than
ever
he
was
more
unhappy
because
he
saw
quite
clearly
that
he
did
not
understand
her
at
all
he
felt
farther
away
from
her
than
ever
and
loved
her
more
devotedly
than
ever
a
desperate
state
of
things
if
he
had
taken
that
sentence
of
hers
i
think
it
too
exciting
now
here
for
me
to
stop
and
think
he
would
i
fancy
have
found
the
clue
to
her
but
he
would
not
believe
that
she
was
so
simple
as
that
in
the
two
days
that
followed
days
of
the
greatest
discomfort
disappointment
and
disorder
his
mind
never
left
her
for
a
moment
his
diary
for
these
four
days
is
very
short
and
unromantic
in
x
morning
worked
in
the
theatre
bandaged
thirty
operation
arm
amputated
learn
that
there
has
been
a
battle
round
the
at
o
where
we
first
were
wonderful
weather
spent
some
time
in
the
park
talked
to
there
evening
moved
thirty
versts
to
p
much
dust
very
slow
owing
to
the
guards
retreating
at
same
time
was
with
durward
and
andrey
vassilievitch
in
a
like
the
latter
but
he
out
of
place
here
arrived
off
early
morning
this
time
black
carriage
with
sisters
k
and
anna
petrovna
more
dust
thousands
of
soldiers
passing
us
singing
as
though
there
were
no
retreat
news
from
l
very
bad
say
there
no
ammunition
arrived
nijnieff
evening
very
hungry
and
thirsty
we
could
find
no
house
for
some
hours
a
charming
little
town
in
a
valley
nestor
seems
huge
very
beautiful
with
wooded
hills
but
whole
place
so
swallowed
in
dust
impossible
to
see
anything
heaps
of
wounded
again
i
and
molozov
in
nice
room
alone
have
not
seen
all
day
this
morning
nikitin
sister
k
goga
and
i
attempted
to
get
back
to
p
to
see
whether
there
were
wounded
started
off
on
the
carts
but
when
we
got
to
the
hill
above
the
village
met
the
whole
of
our
division
coming
out
the
village
abandoned
so
back
we
had
to
go
again
through
all
the
dust
evening
nothing
doing
every
one
depressed
very
early
five
in
the
morning
we
were
roused
and
had
to
take
part
in
an
exodus
like
the
israelites
most
unpleasant
moving
an
inch
an
hour
cossacks
riding
one
down
if
one
preferred
to
go
on
foot
to
being
bumped
in
the
haycart
every
one
in
the
depths
of
depression
crossed
the
nestor
a
perfectly
magnificent
river
five
versts
further
then
stopped
at
a
farmhouse
pitched
tents
instantly
hundreds
of
wounded
battle
fierce
just
other
side
of
nijnieff
worked
like
a
nigger
from
two
to
eight
never
stopped
bandaging
about
ten
went
off
to
the
position
with
molozov
strange
to
be
back
in
the
little
town
under
such
different
circumstances
dark
as
pitch
raining
much
noise
motors
soldiers
like
ghosts
though
shrapnel
all
the
time
tired
depressed
and
nervous
horrid
waiting
doing
nothing
two
houses
under
the
shrapnel
expected
also
at
every
moment
bridge
behind
us
to
be
blown
up
at
last
wagons
filled
with
wounded
started
back
and
got
home
eventually
taking
two
hours
over
it
very
glad
when
it
was
over
we
had
arrived
indeed
although
we
did
not
then
know
it
and
were
expecting
every
moment
to
move
back
again
at
the
conclusion
of
our
first
exodus
our
only
other
transition
after
a
day
or
two
longer
at
our
farmhouse
was
forward
four
versts
to
a
tiny
village
on
a
high
hill
overlooking
the
nestor
to
the
left
of
nijnieff
this
village
was
called
mittövo
mittövo
was
to
be
our
world
for
many
weeks
to
come
we
inhabited
once
again
the
large
white
deserted
with
the
tangled
garden
the
dusty
bare
floors
the
broken
windows
at
the
end
of
the
tangled
garden
there
was
a
white
stone
cross
and
here
was
a
most
wonderful
view
the
high
hill
running
precipitously
down
to
the
flat
silver
expanse
of
the
nestor
that
ran
like
a
gleaming
girdle
under
the
breasts
of
the
slopes
beyond
these
further
slopes
were
clothed
with
wood
i
remember
on
the
first
day
that
i
watched
the
forest
beyond
was
black
and
dense
like
a
cloud
resting
on
the
hill
the
nestor
and
our
own
country
was
soaked
with
sun
that
a
fine
forest
i
said
to
my
companion
yes
the
forest
of
s
stretches
miles
back
into
galicia
it
was
nikitin
that
day
who
spoke
to
me
we
turned
carelessly
away
meanwhile
how
difficult
and
unpleasant
those
first
weeks
at
mittövo
were
we
had
none
of
us
realised
i
suppose
how
sternly
those
days
of
retreat
had
tested
our
nerves
we
had
been
not
only
retreating
but
at
the
same
time
working
fiercely
and
now
when
for
some
while
the
work
slackened
and
under
the
hot
blazing
sun
we
found
nothing
for
our
hands
to
do
a
grinding
irritable
reaction
settled
down
upon
us
i
had
known
in
my
earlier
experience
at
the
war
the
troubles
that
inevitably
rise
from
inaction
the
little
personal
inconveniences
the
tyrannies
of
habits
and
manners
and
appearances
when
you
got
nothing
to
do
but
sit
and
watch
your
immediate
neighbour
but
on
that
earlier
occasion
our
army
had
been
successful
it
seemed
that
the
war
would
soon
find
its
conclusion
in
the
collapse
of
germany
and
good
news
from
europe
smiled
upon
us
every
morning
at
breakfast
now
we
were
tired
and
good
news
there
was
none
indeed
every
day
brought
disastrous
tidings
we
ourselves
must
look
back
upon
a
hundred
versts
of
fair
smiling
country
that
we
had
conquered
with
the
sacrifice
of
many
thousands
of
lives
and
surrendered
without
the
giving
of
a
blow
and
always
the
force
that
compelled
us
to
this
was
sinister
and
ironical
by
its
invisibility
it
was
the
russian
temperament
to
declare
exactly
what
it
felt
to
give
free
rein
to
its
moods
and
dislikes
and
discomforts
the
weather
was
beginning
to
be
fiercely
hot
there
were
many
rumours
of
cholera
and
typhus
we
all
of
us
lost
colour
and
appetite
slept
badly
and
suffered
from
sudden
headaches
three
days
after
our
arrival
at
mittövo
we
had
all
discovered
private
hostilities
and
resentments
i
was
as
bad
as
any
one
i
could
not
endure
the
revolutionary
student
ivan
mihailovitch
i
thought
him
most
uncleanly
in
his
habits
and
i
was
compelled
to
sleep
in
the
same
room
with
him
certainly
it
was
true
that
washing
was
not
one
of
the
most
important
things
in
the
world
to
him
in
the
morning
he
would
lurch
out
of
bed
put
on
a
soiled
shirt
and
trousers
dab
his
face
with
a
decrepit
sponge
take
a
tiny
piece
of
soap
from
an
old
tin
box
look
at
it
rub
it
on
his
fingers
and
put
it
hurriedly
away
again
as
though
he
were
ashamed
of
it
sometimes
getting
out
of
bed
he
would
cry
have
you
heard
the
latest
scandal
about
the
ammunition
in
the
tenth
army
they
say
and
then
he
would
forget
his
washing
altogether
he
did
not
shave
his
head
as
most
of
us
had
done
but
allowed
his
hair
to
grow
very
long
and
this
of
course
was
often
a
subject
of
irritation
to
him
he
had
also
a
habit
of
sitting
on
his
bed
in
his
nightclothes
yawning
and
scratching
his
body
all
over
very
slowly
with
his
long
and
i
afraid
dirty
for
the
space
perhaps
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
this
i
found
difficult
to
endure
his
long
white
face
was
always
a
dirty
shade
of
grey
and
his
jacket
was
stained
with
reminiscences
of
his
meals
his
habits
at
table
were
terrible
he
was
always
so
deeply
interested
in
what
he
was
saying
that
he
had
not
time
to
close
his
mouth
whilst
he
was
eating
to
ask
people
to
pass
him
food
he
stretched
his
long
dirty
hand
across
the
table
or
to
pass
food
to
others
he
shouted
a
great
deal
and
was
in
a
furious
passion
every
five
minutes
i
also
just
at
this
time
found
the
boy
goga
tiresome
the
boy
had
not
been
taught
by
his
parents
the
duty
that
children
owe
to
their
elders
and
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
this
duty
is
almost
universally
untaught
in
russia
to
goga
a
general
was
as
nothing
he
would
contradict
our
old
general
t
when
he
came
to
dine
with
us
would
patronise
the
colonel
and
assure
the
general
that
he
knew
better
he
would
advance
his
father
as
a
perpetual
and
faithful
witness
to
the
truth
of
his
statements
you
may
say
what
you
like
he
would
cry
to
myself
or
a
sister
but
my
father
knows
better
than
you
do
he
has
the
front
seat
in
the
moscow
opera
all
through
the
season
and
has
been
to
england
three
times
goga
also
had
been
once
to
england
for
a
week
spent
entirely
on
the
brighton
pier
and
he
told
me
many
things
he
would
forget
for
a
moment
that
i
was
an
englishman
and
would
assure
me
that
he
knew
better
than
i
did
he
was
a
being
with
the
best
heart
in
the
world
but
his
parents
loved
him
so
much
that
they
had
neglected
his
education
these
things
may
seem
trifling
enough
but
they
had
nevertheless
their
importance
among
the
sisters
sister
k
was
the
unpopular
one
i
myself
must
honestly
confess
that
she
was
a
woman
to
company
less
worthy
than
herself
she
had
an
upright
virtuous
character
but
she
was
narrow
a
rare
fault
in
a
russian
superstitious
dogmatically
religious
and
entirely
without
tact
she
quite
honestly
thought
us
a
poor
lot
and
would
say
to
me
i
hope
durward
you
do
judge
russia
by
the
specimens
you
find
here
and
was
of
course
always
overheard
she
was
a
strict
moralist
but
was
also
generous
with
all
the
warmth
of
russian
generosity
in
money
matters
she
was
a
marvellous
hard
worker
quite
fearless
accurate
and
punctual
in
all
things
she
fought
incessant
battles
with
anna
petrovna
who
hated
her
as
warmly
as
it
was
in
her
quiet
unruffled
heart
to
hate
any
one
the
only
thing
stranger
than
the
fierceness
of
their
quarrels
was
the
suddenness
of
their
conclusion
i
remember
that
at
dinner
one
day
they
fought
a
battle
over
the
question
of
a
clean
towel
with
a
heat
and
vigour
that
was
homeric
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
i
found
them
quietly
talking
together
anna
petrovna
was
showing
sister
k
a
large
and
hideous
photograph
of
her
children
how
sympathetic
how
beautiful
said
sister
k
but
i
thought
you
hated
her
i
said
afterwards
in
confusion
to
anna
petrovna
she
was
very
sympathetic
about
my
children
said
anna
petrovna
placidly
then
of
course
sister
sofia
antonovna
the
sister
with
the
red
eyes
made
trouble
when
she
could
she
was
as
i
discovered
afterwards
a
bitterly
disappointed
woman
having
been
deserted
by
her
fiancé
only
a
week
before
her
marriage
that
had
happened
three
years
ago
and
she
still
loved
him
so
that
she
had
her
excuse
for
her
view
of
the
world
my
friends
seemed
to
me
during
those
first
weeks
at
mittövo
simply
a
company
of
children
i
had
gone
directly
back
to
my
days
in
the
nursery
restraint
of
any
kind
there
was
none
discipline
as
to
time
or
emotions
was
undreamed
of
and
with
it
all
a
vitality
a
warmth
of
heart
a
sincerity
and
honesty
that
made
that
otriad
perhaps
the
most
lovable
company
i
have
ever
known
russians
are
fond
of
sneering
at
themselves
for
him
who
declares
that
he
likes
russia
and
russians
they
have
either
polite
disbelief
or
gentle
contempt
in
england
we
have
qualities
of
endurance
of
reliability
of
solidity
to
which
often
enough
i
long
to
return
but
that
warmth
of
heart
that
i
have
known
here
for
two
long
years
a
warmth
that
means
love
for
the
neglected
for
the
defeated
for
the
helpless
a
warmth
that
lights
a
fire
on
every
hearth
in
every
house
in
russia
that
is
a
greater
thing
than
the
possessors
of
it
know
through
all
the
little
quarrels
and
disputes
of
our
company
there
ran
the
thread
of
the
affair
of
trenchard
marie
ivanovna
and
semyonov
trenchard
was
lighted
now
with
the
pleasure
of
their
affection
and
marie
ivanovna
who
had
been
at
first
so
popular
amongst
them
was
held
to
be
hard
and
capricious
she
at
least
did
not
make
it
easy
for
them
to
like
her
she
had
seemed
in
those
first
days
in
o
as
though
she
wished
to
win
all
their
hearts
but
now
it
was
as
though
she
had
not
time
to
consider
any
of
us
as
though
she
had
something
of
far
greater
importance
to
claim
her
attention
she
was
now
very
continually
with
semyonov
and
yet
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
rather
respect
for
his
opinion
and
admiration
of
his
independence
than
liking
that
compelled
her
he
was
beyond
any
question
in
love
with
her
if
the
name
of
love
can
be
given
to
the
fierce
intolerant
passion
that
governed
him
he
made
no
attempt
to
disguise
his
feelings
was
as
rude
to
the
rest
of
us
as
he
pleased
and
of
course
flung
his
scorn
plentifully
over
trenchard
but
now
i
seemed
to
detect
in
him
some
shades
of
restlessness
and
anxiety
that
i
had
never
seen
in
him
before
he
was
not
sure
of
her
he
did
not
i
believe
understand
her
any
more
than
did
the
rest
of
us
with
justice
indeed
i
was
afraid
for
her
his
passion
i
thought
was
as
surely
and
as
nakedly
a
physical
one
as
any
other
that
i
had
seen
precede
it
and
would
as
certainly
pass
as
all
purely
physical
passions
do
she
was
as
ignorant
of
the
world
as
on
the
day
when
she
arrived
amongst
us
but
my
feeling
about
her
was
that
she
would
receive
his
love
almost
as
though
in
a
dream
her
thoughts
fixed
on
something
far
from
him
and
in
no
way
depending
on
him
at
any
rate
she
was
with
him
now
continually
we
judged
her
proud
and
all
of
us
except
trenchard
who
loved
her
semyonov
who
wanted
her
and
nikitin
who
as
i
now
believe
even
then
understood
her
trenchard
meanwhile
was
confused
and
unsettled
inaction
did
not
suit
him
any
better
than
it
did
the
rest
of
us
he
had
too
much
time
to
think
about
marie
ivanovna
he
was
undoubtedly
pleased
at
his
new
popularity
he
expanded
under
it
and
became
something
of
the
loquacious
and
uncalculating
person
that
he
had
shown
himself
during
his
confession
to
me
in
the
train
to
the
russians
his
loquacity
was
in
no
way
strange
or
unpleasant
they
were
in
the
habit
of
unburdening
themselves
their
hopes
their
disappointments
their
joys
their
tragedies
to
the
first
strangers
whom
they
met
it
seemed
quite
natural
to
them
that
trenchard
puffing
his
rebellious
pipe
should
talk
to
them
about
glebeshire
polchester
rafiel
millie
and
katherine
trenchard
i
like
you
to
meet
katherine
anna
petrovna
he
would
say
you
would
find
her
delightful
she
married
now
to
a
young
man
she
ran
away
with
which
surprised
every
one
her
running
away
i
mean
because
she
was
always
considered
such
a
serious
character
i
forget
whether
you
seen
my
children
anna
petrovna
would
reply
i
must
show
you
their
photograph
and
she
would
produce
the
large
and
hideous
picture
he
was
the
same
as
in
those
first
days
and
yet
how
immensely
not
the
same
he
bore
himself
now
with
a
chivalrous
tact
towards
marie
ivanovna
that
was
beyond
all
praise
he
always
cherished
in
his
heart
his
memory
of
their
little
conversation
in
the
orchard
how
i
wish
he
told
me
that
i
had
made
that
conversation
longer
it
was
so
very
short
and
i
might
so
easily
have
lengthened
it
there
were
so
many
things
afterwards
that
i
might
have
said
and
she
never
gave
me
another
chance
she
never
did
she
kept
him
from
her
kind
to
him
perhaps
but
never
allowing
him
another
moment
intimacy
he
had
almost
the
air
it
seemed
to
me
of
patiently
waiting
for
the
moment
when
she
should
need
him
the
air
too
of
a
man
who
was
sure
in
his
heart
that
that
moment
would
come
and
the
other
thing
that
stiffened
him
was
his
hatred
for
semyonov
hatred
may
seem
too
fierce
a
word
for
the
emotion
of
any
one
as
mild
and
gentle
as
trenchard
and
yet
hatred
at
this
time
it
was
he
seemed
no
longer
afraid
of
semyonov
and
there
was
something
about
him
now
which
surprised
the
other
man
through
all
those
first
days
at
mittövo
when
we
seemed
for
a
moment
almost
to
have
slipped
out
of
the
war
and
to
be
leading
the
smaller
more
quarrelsome
life
of
earlier
days
trenchard
was
occupied
with
only
one
question
what
was
he
feeling
about
semyonov
i
felt
as
though
i
could
stand
anything
if
only
she
did
love
him
since
that
awful
night
of
the
retreat
i
had
resigned
myself
to
losing
her
any
one
should
marry
her
who
would
make
her
happy
but
he
never
but
it
was
the
indecision
that
i
could
not
bear
i
did
know
i
could
tell
what
she
felt
the
indecision
was
not
to
last
much
longer
one
evening
when
we
had
been
at
mittövo
about
a
week
he
was
at
the
cross
watching
the
sun
like
a
crimson
flower
sink
behind
the
dim
grey
forest
the
nestor
in
the
evening
mist
was
a
golden
shadow
under
the
hill
this
beauty
made
him
melancholy
he
was
wishing
passionately
as
he
stood
there
for
work
hard
dangerous
gripping
work
he
did
not
know
that
that
was
to
be
the
last
idle
minute
of
his
life
hearing
a
step
on
the
path
he
turned
round
to
find
semyonov
at
his
side
lovely
view
is
it
said
semyonov
watching
him
lovely
answered
trenchard
semyonov
sat
down
on
the
little
stone
seat
beneath
the
cross
and
looked
up
at
his
rival
trenchard
looked
down
at
him
hating
his
square
stolid
composure
his
thick
thighs
his
fair
beard
his
ironical
eyes
you
a
man
he
thought
how
long
are
you
going
to
be
with
us
do
you
think
asked
semyonov
do
know
depends
on
so
many
things
why
do
you
go
back
to
england
they
want
soldiers
would
pass
my
eyesight
when
are
they
going
to
begin
doing
something
on
the
other
front
do
you
think
when
they
ready
i
suppose
they
very
slow
where
all
your
army
we
heard
so
much
about
there
a
big
army
going
to
be
ready
soon
yes
but
we
were
told
things
would
begin
in
may
it
only
the
germans
who
begun
i
do
know
i
seen
no
english
papers
for
some
weeks
there
was
a
pause
semyonov
smiled
stood
up
looked
into
eyes
i
must
go
to
england
he
said
slowly
after
the
war
marie
ivanovna
and
i
will
go
i
hope
together
she
told
me
that
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
she
hopes
we
will
do
together
later
on
trenchard
returned
semyonov
gaze
after
a
moment
he
said
yes
you
would
enjoy
it
he
waited
then
added
i
must
be
walking
back
now
i
late
and
he
turned
away
to
the
house
chapter
vii
one
night
marie
ivanovna
herself
spoke
to
me
of
semyonov
she
found
me
alone
waiting
for
my
morning
tea
we
were
before
the
others
and
could
hear
in
the
next
room
molozov
splashing
water
about
the
floor
and
crying
to
michail
his
servant
to
pour
yestsho
yestsho
yestsho
still
more
still
more
over
his
head
she
stood
in
the
doorway
looking
as
though
she
hated
my
presence
the
others
have
not
arrived
i
said
it
late
i
can
see
she
answered
every
one
is
idle
now
then
her
voice
changed
she
came
across
to
me
we
talked
of
unimportant
things
for
a
while
then
she
said
i
very
happy
durward
be
kind
about
it
alexei
petrovitch
and
i
she
hesitated
i
looked
at
her
and
saw
that
she
was
again
the
young
and
helpless
girl
whom
i
had
not
seen
since
that
early
morning
before
our
first
battle
i
said
very
lamely
if
you
are
happy
marie
ivanovna
i
am
glad
you
think
it
terrible
of
me
she
said
swiftly
and
why
do
you
all
talk
of
being
happy
what
does
matter
but
i
can
trust
him
he
strong
and
afraid
of
nothing
i
could
say
nothing
of
course
you
think
me
very
bad
that
i
have
treated
john
shamefully
yes
i
will
not
defend
myself
to
you
what
is
there
to
defend
john
and
i
could
never
have
lived
together
you
yourself
must
see
that
it
does
not
matter
what
i
think
i
answered
i
am
friend
and
he
has
no
knowledge
of
life
nor
human
nature
he
has
made
a
bad
start
you
must
forgive
me
if
i
think
more
of
him
than
of
you
marie
ivanovna
yes
she
said
fiercely
it
is
john
john
john
you
all
think
of
but
john
would
not
have
loved
me
if
he
knew
me
as
i
truly
am
and
now
at
last
i
can
be
myself
it
does
not
matter
to
alexei
petrovitch
what
i
am
but
you
have
known
him
so
short
a
time
and
you
have
been
so
quick
if
you
had
waited
waited
she
caught
me
up
waited
how
can
one
wait
when
one
allowed
to
wait
it
must
be
finished
here
at
once
and
i
not
going
to
finish
alone
i
frightened
durward
but
also
i
must
see
it
right
through
he
makes
me
brave
he
afraid
of
nothing
i
leave
this
and
yet
i
was
frightened
to
go
on
alone
with
him
beside
me
i
not
afraid
anna
petrovna
interrupted
us
it
goga
stomach
again
she
said
placidly
he
had
great
pain
all
night
it
was
those
sweets
yesterday
just
give
me
that
glass
my
dear
weak
tea
the
only
thing
he
can
have
well
i
had
said
nothing
to
marie
ivanovna
what
was
there
i
could
have
said
and
the
next
thing
about
trenchard
was
that
he
had
got
his
wish
and
was
lying
on
his
back
once
more
in
one
of
our
nice
simple
uncomfortable
haycarts
looking
up
at
the
evening
sky
this
was
the
evening
after
his
conversation
with
semyonov
quite
suddenly
the
battle
had
caught
us
into
its
arms
again
it
was
raging
now
in
the
woods
to
the
right
of
us
woods
on
the
further
side
of
the
nestor
situated
on
a
tributary
i
will
quote
now
directly
from
his
diary
as
our
line
of
carts
crossed
the
great
river
i
could
hear
the
muffled
of
the
cannons
and
of
the
now
so
conventionally
familiar
nikitin
was
lying
in
silence
at
my
side
behind
us
came
twenty
wagons
with
the
sanitars
the
evening
was
very
still
in
the
woods
misty
over
the
river
the
creaking
of
our
carts
was
the
only
sound
save
the
and
the
i
lay
on
my
back
and
thought
of
semyonov
and
myself
i
had
in
my
mind
two
pictures
one
was
of
semyonov
sitting
on
the
stone
under
the
cross
looking
up
at
me
with
comfortable
and
ironical
insolence
semyonov
so
strong
and
resolute
and
successful
semyonov
who
got
what
he
wanted
did
what
he
wanted
said
what
he
wanted
the
other
picture
was
of
myself
as
i
had
been
the
other
night
when
i
had
gone
with
the
wagons
to
nijnieff
to
fetch
the
wounded
i
saw
myself
standing
in
a
muddy
little
lane
just
outside
the
town
under
pouring
rain
the
wagons
waited
there
the
horses
stamping
now
and
then
and
the
wounded
men
on
the
only
wagon
that
was
filled
moaned
and
cried
shrapnel
whizzed
overhead
sometimes
crying
like
an
echo
in
the
far
distance
sometimes
screaming
with
the
rage
of
a
hurt
animal
close
at
hand
groups
of
soldiers
ran
swiftly
past
me
quite
silent
their
heads
bent
somewhere
on
the
high
road
i
could
hear
spluttering
and
humming
at
irregular
intervals
red
cross
men
would
arrive
with
wounded
would
ask
in
a
whisper
that
was
inhuman
and
isolating
whether
there
were
room
on
my
carts
then
the
body
would
be
lifted
up
there
would
be
muttered
directions
the
wounded
man
would
cry
then
the
other
wounded
would
also
cry
after
that
there
would
be
the
dismal
silence
again
silence
broken
only
by
the
shrapnel
and
the
heavy
plopping
smothers
of
the
rain
but
it
was
myself
upon
whom
my
eyes
were
fixed
myself
a
miserable
figure
the
rain
dripping
from
me
slipping
down
my
neck
squelching
under
my
boots
and
as
i
stood
there
i
was
afraid
that
was
what
i
now
saw
i
had
been
terribly
afraid
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
come
to
the
war
i
had
worked
all
day
in
the
bandaging
room
and
perhaps
my
physical
weariness
was
responsible
but
whatever
it
might
be
there
i
was
a
coward
at
the
threat
of
every
shrapnel
i
bent
my
head
and
shrugged
my
shoulders
at
every
cry
of
the
wounded
men
one
man
was
delirious
and
sang
a
little
song
a
shudder
trembled
all
down
my
body
i
thought
of
the
bridge
between
myself
and
the
otriad
how
easily
it
might
be
blown
up
and
then
if
the
division
were
beaten
back
what
massacre
there
would
be
i
wanted
to
go
home
to
sleep
to
be
safe
and
warm
above
all
to
be
safe
i
saw
before
me
some
of
the
wounded
whom
i
had
bandaged
men
without
faces
or
with
hanging
jaws
that
must
be
held
up
with
the
hand
whilst
the
bandage
was
tied
one
man
blind
one
man
mad
he
thought
he
was
drowning
in
hot
water
one
man
holding
his
stomach
together
with
his
hands
i
saw
all
these
figures
crowding
round
me
in
the
lane
i
also
saw
the
dead
men
in
the
forest
the
skull
the
flies
the
strong
trousers
i
shook
so
that
my
teeth
chattered
a
very
pitiful
figure
well
that
was
the
other
night
it
was
true
that
i
did
not
feel
frightened
at
least
not
as
yet
but
then
it
was
a
beautiful
evening
very
peaceful
still
and
warm
and
there
was
nikitin
in
any
case
there
were
those
two
figures
whom
i
must
consider
semyonov
and
myself
that
brief
conversation
last
night
had
brought
us
quite
sharply
face
to
face
i
found
to
my
own
surprise
that
semyonov
declaration
of
his
engagement
had
not
been
a
great
shock
to
me
had
not
indeed
altered
very
greatly
the
earlier
situation
but
it
had
shown
me
quite
clearly
that
my
own
love
for
marie
ivanovna
was
in
no
way
diminished
that
i
must
protect
her
from
a
man
who
was
i
felt
quite
simply
a
beastly
man
then
if
semyonov
and
i
were
to
fight
it
out
i
would
need
to
be
at
my
best
did
that
little
picture
of
the
other
evening
show
me
at
my
best
this
business
presented
a
bigger
fight
than
the
simple
one
with
semyonov
i
knew
quite
clearly
as
i
lay
on
my
back
in
the
cart
that
the
fight
against
semyonov
and
the
fight
against
was
mingled
together
depended
for
their
issue
one
upon
the
other
that
the
dead
men
in
the
forest
had
no
merely
accidental
connexion
with
marie
ivanovna
safety
and
scornful
piracies
well
semyonov
and
i
i
and
my
old
dead
uncle
myself
shaking
in
the
road
the
other
night
under
the
rain
what
was
to
be
the
issue
of
all
of
it
i
on
this
lovely
evening
saw
quite
clearly
the
progress
of
events
that
had
brought
me
to
this
point
one
that
drive
with
durward
on
the
first
day
when
we
had
stopped
at
the
trench
and
heard
the
frogs
two
the
evening
at
o
when
marie
ivanovna
had
been
angry
and
we
had
first
heard
the
cannon
three
the
day
at
s
and
marie
kneeling
on
the
cart
with
her
hand
on
semyonov
shoulder
four
her
refusal
of
me
the
bodies
in
the
forest
the
retreat
that
night
nikitin
getting
well
into
the
thick
of
it
now
five
the
talk
with
marie
in
the
park
six
the
wet
night
at
nijnieff
seven
last
night
little
talk
with
semyonov
yes
i
could
see
now
that
i
had
been
advancing
always
forward
into
the
forest
growing
ever
nearer
and
nearer
perceiving
now
the
tactics
of
the
enemy
beaten
here
frightened
there
but
still
penetrating
not
as
yet
retreating
and
always
my
private
little
history
marching
with
me
confused
with
the
private
little
histories
of
all
of
the
others
all
of
them
penetrating
more
deeply
and
more
deeply
and
if
i
lost
my
nerve
i
was
beaten
if
i
had
lost
my
nerve
no
protecting
of
marie
no
defiance
of
semyonov
and
far
beyond
these
abject
submission
to
my
enemy
in
the
forest
i
had
lost
my
nerve
i
was
it
only
weariness
the
other
night
but
twice
now
i
had
been
properly
beaten
and
why
after
all
should
i
imagine
that
i
would
be
able
to
put
up
a
fight
i
who
had
never
in
all
my
life
fought
anything
successfully
i
lay
on
my
back
looked
at
the
sky
i
sat
up
looked
at
the
country
i
set
my
teeth
looked
at
nikitin
nikitin
grunted
i
had
a
good
nap
he
said
you
should
have
had
one
there
be
plenty
of
work
for
us
by
the
sound
of
it
we
turned
a
corner
of
the
road
through
the
wood
and
one
of
our
own
batteries
jumped
upon
us
i
glad
it
not
raining
i
said
we
still
some
way
to
go
said
nikitin
sitting
up
what
a
lovely
evening
then
he
added
quite
without
apparent
connexion
well
you
more
at
home
amongst
us
all
now
are
you
yes
said
i
i
glad
of
that
and
what
do
you
think
of
andrey
vassilievitch
i
answered
oh
i
like
him
but
i
do
think
happy
at
the
war
i
added
i
want
you
to
like
him
nikitin
said
he
a
splendid
man
i
have
known
him
many
years
he
is
merry
and
simple
and
it
is
easy
to
laugh
at
him
but
it
is
always
easy
to
laugh
at
the
best
people
you
must
like
him
he
likes
you
very
much
i
felt
as
though
nikitin
were
here
forming
an
alliance
between
the
three
of
us
well
i
liked
nikitin
i
liked
andrey
vassilievitch
i
listened
to
the
battery
now
some
way
behind
us
then
said
of
course
i
am
his
friend
if
he
wishes
nikitin
repeated
solemnly
andrey
vassilievitch
is
a
splendid
fellow
then
we
arrived
here
beside
the
broad
path
of
the
forest
there
was
a
clearing
and
above
the
clearing
a
thick
pattern
of
shining
stars
curved
like
the
top
of
a
shell
here
in
the
open
the
doctors
had
made
a
temporary
hospital
fastening
candles
on
the
trees
arranging
two
tables
on
trestles
all
very
white
and
clean
under
a
brilliant
full
moon
there
were
here
two
sisters
whom
i
did
not
know
several
doctors
one
of
them
a
fat
little
army
doctor
who
had
often
been
a
visitor
to
our
otriad
the
latter
greeted
nikitin
warmly
nodded
to
me
he
was
a
gay
merry
little
man
with
twinkling
eyes
fine
our
hospital
you
think
plenty
to
do
this
night
my
friend
here
this
way
finger
is
it
oh
that
nothing
here
courage
a
moment
where
are
the
scissors
scissors
some
one
one
moment
moment
ah
there
you
are
the
finger
that
had
been
hanging
by
a
shred
fell
into
the
basin
the
soldier
muttered
something
slipped
on
to
his
knees
his
face
grey
under
the
moon
then
huddled
into
nothing
like
a
bundle
of
old
clothes
fainted
helplessly
away
here
water
no
take
him
over
there
that
right
well
how
are
you
lovely
night
plenty
of
work
there
be
too
oh
you
going
down
to
the
yes
they
down
to
the
right
there
somewhere
across
the
fields
warm
over
there
the
noise
just
then
of
the
batteries
was
terrific
we
were
compelled
to
shout
at
one
another
a
battery
behind
us
bellowed
like
a
young
bull
and
the
shrapnel
falling
at
some
distance
amongst
the
trees
had
a
strange
splashing
sound
as
of
a
stone
falling
into
water
a
the
candles
twinkled
in
the
breeze
and
the
place
had
the
air
of
a
celebration
the
wounded
soldiers
waiting
their
turn
as
children
wait
for
their
presents
the
starlight
gave
the
effect
of
a
crispness
to
the
ground
we
arranged
our
wagons
safely
then
followed
by
the
sanitars
walked
off
nikitin
almost
fantastically
tall
under
the
starlight
as
he
strode
along
the
stopped
and
we
came
to
open
country
fields
with
waving
corn
stretched
before
us
to
be
lost
in
the
farther
distance
in
the
dark
shadows
of
the
forest
footnote
a
it
must
be
remembered
that
this
account
is
trenchard
taken
from
his
diary
in
my
own
experience
i
have
never
known
the
bursting
of
shell
to
sound
in
the
least
like
a
stone
in
water
but
he
insists
on
the
accuracy
of
this
throughout
this
and
the
succeeding
chapters
there
are
many
statements
for
which
i
have
only
his
a
little
bunch
of
soldiers
crouched
here
watching
nikitin
spoke
to
them
here
tell
me
what
moskovsky
your
honour
and
the
vengerovsky
they
to
the
right
are
they
yes
your
honour
by
the
high
road
when
it
comes
into
the
forest
what
there
where
the
road
turns
how
are
things
down
there
just
now
wounded
do
you
think
mogoo
i
unable
to
say
your
honour
but
there
been
an
attack
there
an
hour
ago
are
those
ours
listening
to
a
battery
across
the
fields
ours
your
honour
well
we
go
on
and
see
i
had
listened
to
this
conversation
with
the
sensation
of
a
man
who
has
stopped
himself
on
the
very
edge
of
a
precipice
i
thought
in
those
few
moments
with
a
marvellous
and
penetrating
clarity
i
had
after
all
been
always
until
now
at
the
battle
of
s
or
when
i
had
gone
with
the
wagons
to
nijnieff
on
the
outskirts
of
the
thing
i
knew
that
in
another
ten
minutes
i
would
be
in
the
middle
the
very
middle
as
i
waited
there
i
recalled
the
pages
of
the
diary
of
some
officer
a
diary
that
had
been
shown
me
quite
casually
by
its
owner
it
had
been
a
miracle
of
laconic
brevity
down
to
the
battery
all
quiet
three
of
their
shells
one
of
ours
killed
two
wounded
five
yards
distance
breakfasted
arrived
from
the
house
all
quiet
there
and
so
on
this
i
knew
was
the
proper
way
to
look
at
the
affair
down
to
the
battery
breakfasted
dead
for
the
life
of
me
now
i
could
not
look
at
it
like
that
i
saw
a
thousand
things
that
were
perhaps
not
really
there
but
were
there
at
any
rate
for
me
if
i
was
beaten
i
was
beaten
once
and
for
all
i
saw
the
shining
road
under
the
starlight
and
shadows
of
wounded
men
groaning
and
stumbling
whispering
their
way
along
let
go
said
nikitin
i
drew
a
breath
and
stepped
out
into
the
moonlight
a
shell
burst
with
a
delicate
splash
of
fire
amongst
the
stars
the
road
looked
very
long
and
very
very
lonely
however
soon
i
found
myself
walking
along
it
quite
casually
and
talking
about
unimportant
peaceful
things
come
i
thought
to
myself
this
really
is
so
bad
it
a
great
pity
nikitin
said
that
i
ca
read
english
have
to
take
your
novelists
as
they
choose
to
give
them
us
who
is
there
now
in
england
well
said
i
as
one
talks
in
a
dream
there
hardy
and
henry
james
and
conrad
i
seen
translations
of
conrad
in
petrograd
and
then
there
wells
yes
wells
i
know
but
he
writes
stories
for
boys
there
jack
london
but
his
are
american
i
like
to
read
an
english
novel
sometimes
your
english
life
is
so
cosy
you
have
tea
before
the
fire
and
everything
is
comfortable
we
do
know
what
comfort
is
in
russia
a
machine
gun
close
to
us
and
three
rockets
like
a
flight
of
startled
birds
rose
suddenly
together
on
the
far
horizon
no
we
have
no
comfort
in
russia
repeated
nikitin
now
i
fancy
that
an
english
we
had
reached
the
further
wood
the
moonlight
fell
away
from
us
and
the
shadows
shifted
and
trembled
under
the
reflection
of
rockets
and
a
projector
that
swung
lazily
and
unsteadily
like
something
nodding
in
its
sleep
on
the
left
of
the
road
there
was
a
house
standing
back
in
its
own
garden
i
could
see
dimly
that
this
was
a
row
of
country
villas
stand
by
this
gate
five
minutes
nikitin
whispered
to
me
i
must
find
the
colonel
the
sanitars
will
come
and
fetch
you
when
i
settled
the
spot
for
our
bandaging
nikitin
disappeared
and
i
was
quite
alone
i
felt
terribly
desolate
i
stood
back
against
the
gate
of
the
villa
watching
soldiers
hurry
by
seeing
high
mysterious
hedges
the
roofs
of
houses
a
line
of
lighted
sky
the
tops
of
trees
all
these
things
rising
and
falling
as
the
glare
in
the
heavens
rose
and
fell
there
was
sometimes
a
terrible
noise
and
sometimes
an
equally
terrible
stillness
somewhere
in
the
darkness
a
man
was
groaning
oh
ah
oh
ah
without
cessation
somewhere
the
gate
of
one
of
the
villas
swung
to
and
fro
creaking
sometimes
soldiers
would
stare
at
my
motionless
figure
and
then
pass
on
all
this
time
as
in
one
dreams
sometimes
one
holds
off
a
nightmare
i
was
keeping
my
fear
at
bay
i
had
now
exactly
the
sensation
that
i
had
known
so
often
in
my
dream
that
i
was
standing
somewhere
in
the
dark
that
the
enemy
was
watching
me
and
waiting
to
spring
but
i
was
only
afraid
one
step
on
my
part
one
extra
noise
one
more
flare
of
light
and
i
would
abandon
myself
to
panic
but
although
the
perspiration
was
wet
on
my
forehead
my
heart
thumping
and
my
hands
dry
and
hot
i
was
not
yet
afraid
i
had
a
strange
sensation
of
suffocation
as
though
i
were
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
a
well
black
and
damp
with
the
stars
of
the
sky
miles
away
there
came
to
me
with
a
kind
of
ironic
sentimentality
the
picture
of
the
at
home
in
polchester
the
corner
where
the
piano
stood
with
a
palm
in
an
ugly
brass
pot
just
behind
it
the
table
near
the
door
with
a
brass
indian
tray
and
a
fat
with
gilt
clasps
the
picture
of
christ
being
scourged
above
the
fireplace
and
the
green
silk
screen
that
stood
under
the
picture
in
the
summer
a
soldier
stopped
and
spoke
to
me
your
honour
it
on
the
right
the
next
gate
i
followed
him
without
attention
having
no
doubt
but
that
this
was
one
of
our
own
sanitars
and
accompanied
a
group
of
soldiers
that
surrounded
a
bobbing
kitchen
on
wheels
i
was
puzzled
by
the
kitchen
because
i
knew
that
one
had
not
been
brought
by
our
otriad
but
i
thought
that
the
doctors
of
the
division
had
perhaps
begged
our
men
to
aid
the
army
sanitars
we
hurried
through
a
gate
to
the
right
where
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
yard
of
some
kind
the
kitchen
was
established
and
then
from
out
of
the
very
earth
as
it
seemed
soldiers
appeared
clustering
around
it
with
their
tin
cans
the
soldier
who
was
in
charge
of
the
party
said
to
me
in
a
confidential
whisper
there
plenty
of
your
honour
and
the
soup
will
last
us
too
very
good
said
i
in
a
bewildered
voice
at
the
strange
accent
the
soldier
looked
at
me
and
then
i
looked
at
the
soldier
the
soldier
was
a
stranger
to
me
a
pleasant
round
man
with
a
huge
smiling
mouth
and
two
chins
and
i
was
a
stranger
to
the
soldier
well
said
the
soldier
looking
i
thought
i
thought
said
i
most
uncomfortable
the
soldiers
vanished
back
into
the
darknesses
round
the
kitchen
voices
whispering
could
be
heard
now
that
the
end
thought
i
i
shot
as
a
german
spy
i
looked
at
the
soldiers
clustered
like
bees
round
the
kitchen
then
i
slipped
through
the
gate
into
the
dark
road
i
stood
there
listening
the
battle
seemed
to
have
drawn
away
because
i
could
hear
rifles
cannon
muffled
round
a
corner
of
the
hill
here
there
was
now
silence
broken
only
by
soldiers
who
hurried
up
the
road
or
went
in
and
out
at
the
villa
gates
i
felt
abandoned
how
was
i
to
discover
nikitin
again
before
what
gate
had
i
stood
i
did
not
know
i
seemed
to
know
nothing
i
moved
down
the
road
very
miserable
and
very
cold
i
had
stupidly
left
my
coat
in
one
of
the
wagons
i
walked
on
my
boots
knocking
against
one
another
thinking
to
myself
if
i
not
given
something
to
do
very
soon
i
shall
be
just
as
i
was
the
other
night
at
nijnieff
and
then
i
shall
suddenly
take
to
my
heels
down
this
road
as
hard
as
i
can
go
it
was
then
that
i
tumbled
straight
into
the
arms
of
nikitin
who
was
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
watching
for
me
i
was
so
happy
that
i
felt
now
afraid
of
nothing
i
held
nikitin
arm
babbling
something
about
kitchens
and
germans
well
i
do
understand
what
you
say
i
remember
nikitin
replied
but
you
must
come
and
work
there
plenty
of
it
we
moved
to
a
cottage
on
the
very
boundary
of
the
forest
where
a
little
common
ran
down
to
the
moonlight
passing
through
a
narrow
passage
i
entered
into
a
little
room
with
a
large
white
stove
on
the
top
of
the
stove
under
the
roof
crouched
a
boy
or
a
young
man
with
long
black
hair
and
a
white
face
this
youth
wore
what
resembled
a
white
shirt
over
baggy
white
trousers
his
feet
were
bare
and
very
dirty
nothing
moved
except
his
eyes
he
sat
there
in
exactly
that
position
all
night
the
room
was
small
but
was
the
best
that
could
be
obtained
within
the
space
of
ten
minutes
it
became
a
perfect
shambles
the
wounded
were
brought
in
without
pause
and
under
the
candlelight
nikitin
two
sanitars
and
i
worked
until
the
sweat
ran
down
our
backs
and
arms
in
streams
it
dripped
from
my
nose
into
my
mouth
into
my
eyes
the
wounds
were
horrible
no
man
seemed
to
come
into
the
room
with
an
unmangled
body
the
smell
rose
higher
and
higher
the
bloody
rags
lay
about
the
kitchen
floor
torn
arms
smashed
legs
heads
with
gaping
wounds
the
pitiful
crying
and
praying
the
shrill
voices
of
the
delirious
nikitin
his
arms
steeped
in
blood
to
the
elbows
probing
cutting
digging
i
myself
bandaging
until
i
did
not
know
what
my
hands
were
doing
then
suddenly
the
battle
coming
right
back
to
us
again
overhead
now
as
it
seemed
the
cannon
shaking
three
silly
staring
china
dogs
on
the
kitchen
dresser
the
rifle
fire
clattering
like
tumbling
crockery
about
the
walls
of
the
cottage
and
through
it
all
the
white
youth
crouched
like
a
ghost
on
the
stove
watching
without
pause
ah
no
your
honour
ah
no
i
ca
i
ca
oh
oh
oh
oh
and
then
sobs
the
man
breaking
down
like
a
child
hiding
his
face
in
his
arms
his
wounded
leg
twitching
convulsively
i
paused
wiped
the
sweat
from
my
eyes
stood
up
nikitin
looked
at
me
take
some
fresh
air
he
said
go
out
with
the
stretcher
for
half
an
hour
i
can
manage
here
i
wiped
my
forehead
sure
you
can
manage
i
asked
quite
said
nikitin
here
hold
his
back
no
his
ca
you
get
your
arm
under
there
like
that
golubchik
only
a
minute
there
there
i
washed
my
hands
and
went
out
the
air
caressed
my
forehead
like
cold
water
from
the
little
garden
at
the
back
there
came
scents
of
flowers
the
moonlight
was
blue
on
the
common
eight
sanitars
were
waiting
to
start
the
feldscher
in
charge
of
them
did
not
i
thought
seem
greatly
pleased
when
he
saw
me
but
then
i
am
often
stupidly
sensitive
no
one
said
anything
and
we
started
we
carried
two
stretchers
and
a
soldier
from
the
trenches
was
with
us
to
guide
us
i
could
see
that
the
men
were
not
happy
i
heard
one
of
them
mutter
to
another
that
they
should
not
have
been
sent
now
that
they
should
have
waited
until
the
attack
was
over
and
the
full
moon
did
any
one
ever
see
such
a
moon
we
came
to
and
advanced
very
carefully
as
we
crossed
the
road
i
was
conscious
of
great
excitement
the
noise
around
us
was
terrific
and
different
from
any
noise
that
i
heard
before
i
did
not
think
at
the
time
but
was
informed
afterwards
that
it
was
because
we
were
almost
directly
under
a
cliff
the
actual
position
about
whose
possession
the
battle
was
being
fought
that
the
noise
was
so
tremendous
the
echo
flung
everything
back
so
that
each
report
sounded
three
or
four
times
this
certainly
had
the
strangest
effect
a
background
as
it
were
of
rolling
thunder
sometimes
distant
sometimes
very
close
and
in
front
of
this
clapping
bellowing
stamping
and
then
suddenly
an
absolutely
effect
as
though
some
one
cried
well
this
will
settle
it
in
quieter
intervals
one
heard
the
birdlike
flight
of
bullets
above
one
head
and
the
irritated
bad
temper
of
the
at
every
noise
the
sanitars
who
were
i
believe
schoolmasters
and
little
clerks
and
therefore
of
a
more
sensitive
head
than
the
peasant
soldier
ducked
their
heads
and
one
fat
man
tried
to
lie
down
flat
on
two
occasions
and
was
cursed
heartily
by
the
feldscher
i
myself
felt
no
fear
but
only
a
pounding
exhilarating
excitement
because
i
was
at
last
really
in
it
we
found
one
wounded
man
very
soon
lying
under
the
hedge
with
the
top
of
his
head
gone
four
sanitars
their
relief
showed
very
plainly
in
their
faces
returned
with
him
we
advanced
again
skirting
now
a
little
orchard
and
keeping
always
in
the
shadow
under
the
hedge
our
guide
the
soldier
assured
us
that
the
wounded
man
was
very
near
quite
close
then
we
came
to
a
large
barn
on
the
edge
of
what
seemed
a
silver
lake
but
was
in
reality
a
long
field
under
the
full
light
of
the
moon
as
we
paused
i
saw
on
the
further
side
of
the
field
two
shells
burst
very
quickly
one
after
the
other
we
all
stopped
under
the
shelter
of
the
barn
well
said
the
feldscher
to
the
soldier
where
your
man
only
a
short
way
said
the
soldier
quite
close
across
that
field
asked
the
feldscher
pointing
to
the
moonlight
yes
certainly
said
the
soldier
the
feldscher
scratched
his
head
we
ca
go
further
without
orders
he
said
that
very
dangerous
in
front
there
i
responsible
for
these
men
we
must
return
and
ask
your
honour
he
said
turning
to
me
we
shall
be
nearly
an
hour
returning
i
said
is
your
friend
badly
wounded
i
asked
the
soldier
very
said
he
you
see
i
said
to
the
feldscher
we
ca
possibly
leave
him
like
that
it
only
a
little
way
the
feldscher
shook
his
head
i
ca
be
responsible
i
had
my
orders
to
go
so
far
and
no
further
i
must
see
that
my
men
are
safe
the
sanitars
who
were
sitting
in
a
row
on
their
haunches
under
the
shadow
of
the
barn
all
nodded
their
heads
i
did
know
russians
were
cowards
i
said
fiercely
the
feldscher
shook
his
head
quite
unmoved
your
honour
must
understand
that
i
had
my
orders
then
he
added
slowly
but
of
course
if
your
honour
wishes
to
go
yourself
i
would
come
with
you
the
others
they
must
do
as
they
please
they
are
in
their
right
to
return
but
i
should
advise
that
we
return
i
going
on
i
said
i
must
say
here
that
i
felt
no
other
sensation
than
a
blind
and
quite
obstinate
selfishness
i
had
no
thought
of
nikitin
or
of
the
sanitars
i
did
not
and
this
i
must
emphasise
think
for
a
moment
of
the
wounded
man
if
the
situation
had
been
that
by
returning
i
should
save
many
lives
and
by
advancing
should
save
only
my
own
i
should
still
have
advanced
if
the
only
hope
for
the
wounded
man
was
my
instant
speech
with
nikitin
i
would
not
have
gone
back
to
speak
with
him
i
was
at
this
moment
neither
brave
nor
fearful
i
repeat
that
i
had
no
sensation
except
an
absolutely
selfish
obstinate
challenge
that
i
myself
was
addressing
to
something
in
space
i
was
saying
at
last
my
chance
has
come
now
you
shall
see
whether
i
fly
from
you
or
no
you
shall
do
your
worst
and
fail
i
the
hunter
now
not
the
hunted
i
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
this
quite
childish
preoccupation
with
myself
i
was
nevertheless
pleased
with
myself
there
you
see
some
one
near
me
seemed
to
say
he
not
quite
so
unpractical
after
all
he
full
of
common
sense
i
looked
at
the
row
of
sanitars
squatting
on
the
ground
and
felt
like
a
schoolmaster
with
his
children
you
better
go
home
then
i
said
scornfully
the
feldscher
who
was
a
short
stocky
man
with
a
red
face
and
melancholy
eyes
something
like
a
turned
poet
dismissed
them
they
went
off
in
a
line
under
the
hedge
the
man
obviously
thought
me
a
tiresome
prig
he
had
no
romantic
illusions
about
the
business
he
had
not
been
a
feldscher
during
twenty
years
for
nothing
and
knew
that
a
wound
was
a
wound
when
a
man
was
dead
he
was
however
truly
it
not
far
he
asked
the
soldier
the
man
answered
his
face
quite
without
expression
we
crossed
the
moonlit
field
and
for
a
brief
moment
silence
fell
as
though
an
audience
were
holding
its
breath
watching
us
on
the
other
side
were
cottages
the
outskirts
of
a
tiny
village
here
beside
these
cottages
we
fell
into
a
fantastic
world
that
small
village
must
in
other
times
have
been
a
pretty
place
nestling
with
its
gardens
by
the
river
under
the
hill
it
seemed
now
to
rock
and
rattle
under
the
noise
of
the
cannon
all
the
open
spaces
were
like
white
marble
in
the
moonlight
and
in
these
open
spaces
there
was
utter
silence
and
emptiness
the
place
seemed
deserted
and
yet
in
every
shadow
in
long
lines
under
the
cottage
wells
in
little
clumps
and
clusters
round
trees
or
ruins
there
were
eyes
staring
the
gleam
of
muskets
shone
little
specks
of
light
dancing
from
wall
to
wall
everywhere
there
were
bodies
legs
boots
arms
heads
sudden
caps
sudden
fingers
sudden
hot
and
streaming
breaths
and
over
everything
this
infernal
noise
and
yet
no
human
sound
a
nightmare
of
the
true
nightmare
of
dreams
the
open
silver
spaces
the
little
gardens
thick
with
flowers
the
high
moon
and
the
starry
sky
not
a
living
soul
to
be
seen
and
nevertheless
watchers
everywhere
step
forward
on
to
that
little
plot
of
grass
in
front
of
the
cottage
windows
and
you
a
dead
man
the
moonlight
said
there
were
men
in
the
body
of
the
earth
not
in
trenches
but
in
holes
my
foot
stepped
on
a
head
of
hair
and
some
low
voice
cursed
me
i
was
i
suppose
by
this
time
a
little
delirious
with
my
adventure
i
know
that
i
could
now
distinguish
no
separate
sounds
shells
and
bullets
had
vanished
and
in
their
stead
were
whispers
and
screams
and
shouts
of
triumph
and
bursts
of
laughter
songs
in
chorus
somewhere
miners
hammering
below
the
earth
somewhere
storm
at
sea
with
the
crash
of
waves
on
rocks
and
the
shriek
of
wind
through
rigging
somewhere
some
one
who
dropped
heavy
loads
of
furniture
so
carelessly
that
i
cursed
him
and
always
these
little
patches
of
moonlight
so
tempting
just
because
one
was
forbidden
we
were
not
popular
here
husky
breathless
voices
whispered
to
us
to
be
away
from
here
quick
we
would
draw
the
fire
what
did
we
want
here
now
have
you
any
wounded
we
whispered
in
return
no
no
the
answer
came
keep
away
from
the
moonlight
the
voices
came
to
us
connected
sometimes
with
a
nose
an
eye
or
a
leg
often
enough
out
of
the
heaven
itself
there
a
man
wounded
behind
the
next
lines
some
voice
murmured
we
stumbled
on
and
suddenly
came
to
a
river
with
very
steep
banks
and
a
number
of
narrow
and
slender
bridges
if
this
in
reality
been
a
nightmare
this
river
could
not
have
obtruded
itself
more
often
than
it
did
we
discovered
to
our
dismay
that
our
had
disappeared
exactly
as
in
a
nightmare
he
would
have
done
we
crossed
the
river
bathed
of
course
in
moonlight
the
plank
bridge
shaking
and
quivering
beneath
us
we
had
then
a
difficult
task
here
a
row
of
cottages
beneath
the
very
edge
of
the
bank
and
in
the
cottage
shadow
the
soldiers
were
ranged
in
a
long
line
their
boots
stretched
to
the
verge
of
the
bank
which
was
slippery
and
uncertain
we
had
to
walk
on
this
with
our
stretchers
stepping
between
the
boots
stumbling
often
and
slipping
down
towards
the
water
any
wounded
we
whispered
again
and
again
no
the
whisper
came
back
hasten
take
care
of
the
moonlight
and
then
to
my
infinite
relief
and
comfort
behind
the
cottages
we
found
our
wounded
man
there
was
a
dark
yard
here
apparently
quite
deserted
the
feldscher
made
an
exclamation
and
stepped
forward
three
bodies
lay
together
over
one
another
two
men
were
dead
and
cold
the
third
stirred
very
faintly
as
we
came
up
opened
his
eyes
smiled
and
said
eh
at
last
as
we
moved
him
on
to
the
stretcher
with
a
little
sigh
he
fainted
again
he
had
a
bad
before
picking
up
the
stretcher
the
feldscher
wiped
his
forehead
and
crossed
himself
it
a
heavy
thing
for
two
he
said
he
a
big
man
looking
at
the
soldier
there
was
now
somewhere
apparently
not
very
far
away
hot
rifle
fire
the
crackle
sparkled
in
the
air
as
though
one
were
living
in
a
world
in
which
all
the
electricity
was
loose
the
other
firing
seemed
to
have
drawn
away
and
the
boom
boom
boom
in
front
of
us
was
echo
from
the
hill
we
picked
up
the
stretcher
and
started
it
was
fortunate
for
us
that
we
had
that
difficult
bit
beside
the
river
at
the
beginning
of
our
journey
i
do
know
how
we
managed
it
stepping
over
the
endless
row
of
legs
with
every
side
step
the
stretcher
lurching
over
to
the
left
and
threatening
to
pitch
us
into
the
river
so
slippery
too
was
the
ground
that
our
boots
refused
to
grip
the
man
on
the
stretcher
was
dreaming
making
a
little
sound
like
an
unceasing
lullaby
on
two
notes
na
na
na
na
na
na
we
were
compelled
to
cross
the
river
twice
and
the
planks
bent
under
our
weight
until
i
was
assured
that
they
would
snap
my
arms
were
beginning
to
ache
and
the
sweat
to
trickle
down
my
spine
my
right
boot
had
rubbed
my
heel
we
left
the
river
behind
us
and
then
suddenly
my
right
hand
began
to
slip
off
the
iron
handle
of
the
stretcher
we
have
to
put
it
down
a
moment
i
said
we
laid
it
on
the
ground
and
at
the
same
instant
a
bullet
sang
so
close
to
my
ear
that
i
felt
it
as
though
an
insect
had
bitten
me
then
a
shell
exploding
as
it
seemed
to
us
amongst
the
very
cottages
where
we
had
just
been
startled
us
we
saved
our
man
said
the
feldscher
looking
at
the
soldier
but
we
better
move
on
it
uncomfortable
here
we
picked
the
thing
up
and
started
again
and
at
once
my
hand
began
to
slip
away
from
its
hold
nightmare
sensation
exactly
i
bent
my
head
down
managed
to
lick
my
hand
without
raising
it
and
stiffened
the
muscles
of
my
arm
we
were
watched
once
more
by
a
million
eyes
again
i
stepped
on
a
head
of
hair
buried
somewhere
in
the
ground
then
some
voice
cried
shrilly
ah
ah
some
man
hit
every
bone
in
my
body
began
to
ache
i
was
of
course
rottenly
trained
without
a
sound
muscle
in
my
body
and
my
legs
threatened
cramp
my
heel
grated
against
my
boot
and
sent
a
stab
to
my
stomach
with
every
movement
my
shoulders
seemed
to
pull
away
from
the
stretcher
as
though
they
would
separately
rebel
against
my
orders
and
my
hand
began
again
to
slip
the
feldscher
also
began
to
feel
the
strain
once
he
asked
me
to
stop
he
apologised
i
could
see
the
sweat
pouring
down
his
face
a
very
big
man
he
said
whether
it
were
the
echo
whether
my
ears
had
by
this
time
been
utterly
deafened
and
confused
i
do
not
know
but
now
the
shock
and
rumble
of
the
cannon
seemed
to
come
directly
from
under
my
feet
i
felt
perhaps
as
though
i
were
on
one
of
those
railways
that
i
have
seen
in
london
at
a
fair
when
the
ground
shakes
and
quivers
beneath
you
it
really
would
not
have
surprised
me
had
the
earth
suddenly
yawned
and
swallowed
me
every
plague
now
beset
me
my
hand
refused
to
hold
the
stretcher
my
body
was
wet
with
perspiration
my
face
was
for
some
reason
covered
with
mud
there
was
a
snap
and
my
braces
burst
my
belt
was
loose
and
my
trousers
as
though
they
had
waited
for
their
opportunity
slipped
down
over
my
knees
i
felt
the
cold
night
wind
on
my
flesh
neither
decency
nor
comfort
mattered
to
me
now
i
would
have
walked
gladly
naked
through
the
world
the
feldscher
was
making
a
grinding
noise
between
his
teeth
i
was
no
longer
conscious
of
shell
or
bullets
i
heard
no
noise
i
was
aware
of
neither
light
nor
darkness
i
could
not
have
told
my
name
had
any
one
asked
me
it
i
did
not
recognise
trees
nor
houses
nor
was
i
at
all
aware
that
with
a
muddy
face
and
my
trousers
down
to
my
knees
i
was
a
strange
figure
i
was
aware
of
one
thing
only
that
i
must
keep
my
right
hand
on
the
stretcher
my
left
behaved
decently
enough
but
my
right
was
a
rebel
i
felt
a
personal
fury
against
it
as
though
i
said
to
it
ah
but
i
punish
you
when
i
get
back
i
with
all
my
mental
consciousness
willed
it
to
remain
on
the
handle
it
slipped
i
drove
it
back
it
slipped
further
it
was
almost
gone
with
a
supreme
effort
i
drove
it
back
again
i
fall
off
said
my
hand
you
shall
said
i
i
have
cried
my
hand
triumphantly
back
i
swore
driving
it
we
were
now
i
believe
both
stumbling
along
the
wounded
man
pitching
from
side
to
side
of
the
rest
of
our
journey
i
have
the
most
confused
memory
the
firing
had
no
longer
any
effect
upon
me
i
was
thinking
of
my
rebellious
hand
my
aching
heel
and
the
irritation
of
my
trousers
clustered
about
my
legs
another
step
and
i
shall
fall
i
thought
i
shall
sleep
i
heard
from
a
great
distance
as
it
seemed
the
soldier
na
na
na
na
i
replied
to
him
as
a
nurse
to
her
child
na
na
na
na
then
i
heard
nikitin
voice
half
an
hour
after
my
adventure
i
was
watching
the
dawn
flood
the
sky
from
the
little
garden
at
the
back
of
the
cottage
it
seemed
that
those
stretchers
are
really
heavy
things
for
any
two
men
to
carry
we
had
been
three
hours
on
our
journey
well
i
sat
in
the
garden
watching
the
sun
rise
to
my
right
were
four
dead
men
neatly
laid
out
in
a
row
under
a
tree
their
faces
had
not
been
covered
but
their
eyes
were
closed
their
cheeks
hands
and
feet
like
wax
in
front
of
them
the
young
man
who
had
sat
on
the
stove
in
the
kitchen
all
night
and
watched
us
at
work
was
mowing
the
tall
grass
with
a
scythe
he
was
going
to
dig
graves
he
wore
a
white
shirt
and
white
trousers
and
had
long
black
hair
why
did
they
take
you
for
a
soldier
i
asked
him
consumptive
he
said
i
had
washed
my
face
hitched
up
my
trousers
i
sat
on
the
trunk
of
a
tree
watched
the
dew
on
the
grass
and
the
faint
blue
like
the
colour
of
a
bird
egg
flood
the
sky
staining
it
pale
yellow
all
firing
had
utterly
ceased
there
was
not
a
sound
except
the
birds
in
the
trees
who
were
beginning
to
sing
a
soldier
a
fine
grave
figure
with
a
black
beard
was
washing
in
a
little
pool
at
the
end
of
the
garden
he
was
naked
save
for
his
white
drawers
there
was
i
repeat
not
a
sound
our
cottage
looked
so
peaceful
smoke
coming
from
the
chimney
no
sign
of
the
shambles
no
sign
except
the
four
dead
men
all
so
grave
and
quiet
the
blue
in
the
sky
grew
deeper
then
the
sun
rose
a
jolly
gold
ball
with
red
clouds
swinging
in
streamers
away
from
it
the
birds
sang
above
my
head
so
loudly
that
the
boy
who
was
mowing
looked
up
at
them
the
soldier
finished
his
washing
put
on
his
shirt
he
was
a
mahommedan
i
perceived
because
he
prayed
very
solemnly
his
face
to
the
sun
bowing
to
the
ground
the
grass
fell
before
the
flashing
scythe
the
sun
flamed
behind
the
trees
and
i
was
happy
as
i
had
never
known
happiness
in
my
life
before
i
had
done
only
what
all
the
soldiers
are
doing
every
day
of
their
lives
i
had
been
only
where
they
always
were
but
i
felt
that
i
need
never
be
afraid
again
every
one
knows
how
an
early
summer
morning
can
give
one
confidence
in
my
happiness
god
forgive
me
i
thought
that
my
struggles
were
at
an
end
that
i
had
met
my
enemy
and
defeated
him
that
i
was
worthy
and
able
to
defend
marie
these
things
may
seem
foolish
now
when
one
knows
what
followed
them
but
the
happiness
of
that
morning
at
least
was
real
perhaps
all
over
europe
there
were
men
at
that
moment
happy
as
i
was
because
they
had
proved
something
to
themselves
then
nikitin
called
to
me
laughing
tea
and
white
bread
and
sausage
all
right
i
coming
i
answered
listen
i
called
to
the
soldier
bring
me
some
water
in
your
kettle
i
wash
my
hands
he
came
smiling
towards
me
i
have
given
the
incidents
of
this
night
in
great
detail
for
my
own
satisfaction
because
i
wish
to
forget
nothing
to
others
the
little
adventure
must
seem
trivial
but
to
myself
it
represented
the
climax
of
a
chain
of
events
part
two
chapter
i
the
lovers
semyonov
and
marie
ivanovna
did
not
offer
us
a
picture
of
idealised
love
they
did
not
offer
us
a
picture
of
anything
and
although
they
were
both
of
them
most
certainly
changed
they
could
not
be
said
in
any
way
to
do
what
the
otriad
expected
of
them
the
otriad
quite
frankly
expected
them
to
be
ashamed
of
themselves
to
expect
that
of
semyonov
at
any
time
showed
a
lamentable
lack
of
interest
in
human
character
but
as
i
have
already
said
our
otriad
was
always
excited
by
results
rather
than
causes
semyonov
had
never
shown
himself
ashamed
of
anything
and
he
most
certainly
did
not
intend
to
begin
now
he
had
never
disguised
his
love
for
marie
ivanovna
and
now
she
was
his
spoils
won
by
his
own
strong
piratical
hand
from
the
good
but
rather
feeble
bark
trenchard
he
manifested
his
scorn
of
us
more
openly
than
ever
he
seemed
to
have
grown
rather
stronger
and
stouter
during
these
last
months
and
his
square
stolidity
was
a
thing
at
which
to
marvel
had
he
been
taller
had
his
beard
been
pointed
rather
than
square
he
would
have
been
graceful
and
even
picturesque
but
his
figure
as
he
strode
along
showed
foursquare
as
though
it
had
been
hewn
out
of
wood
one
of
those
pale
almost
white
woods
would
give
the
effect
of
his
fair
beard
and
eyebrows
his
thick
red
lips
were
more
startling
than
ever
curved
as
they
usually
were
in
cynical
contempt
of
some
foolish
victim
how
he
did
despise
us
when
one
of
our
childish
quarrels
arose
at
he
would
say
nothing
but
would
continue
stolidly
his
serious
business
of
eating
he
was
very
fond
of
his
food
which
he
ate
in
the
greediest
manner
when
the
quarrel
was
subsiding
as
it
usually
did
into
the
first
glasses
of
tea
he
would
look
up
watch
us
with
his
contemptuous
blue
eyes
laugh
and
say
well
and
now
who
is
it
next
and
every
one
would
be
clumsily
embarrassed
we
were
often
as
are
all
russian
companies
ridiculously
amused
about
nothing
at
the
most
serious
crises
we
would
like
gayeff
in
the
cherry
orchard
suddenly
break
into
stupid
bursts
of
laughter
quite
aimless
but
with
a
great
deal
of
sincerity
whirls
of
laughter
would
invade
our
table
oh
do
look
at
goga
some
one
would
say
and
there
we
all
were
perhaps
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
semyonov
strangely
enough
shared
this
childish
habit
and
there
was
nothing
odder
than
to
see
the
man
lose
control
of
himself
double
himself
up
laugh
until
the
tears
ran
down
his
face
simply
at
nothing
at
all
the
truth
is
that
now
i
was
very
far
from
hating
him
there
were
moments
certainly
when
he
was
rude
to
the
sisters
when
he
was
abominably
greedy
when
he
was
ruthlessly
selfish
when
he
poured
scorn
upon
me
at
such
times
i
thought
him
as
trenchard
has
expressed
it
a
beastly
man
he
certainly
had
no
great
opinion
of
myself
you
think
yourself
very
clever
ivan
andreievitch
yes
you
think
watching
all
of
us
and
studying
all
our
characters
and
i
suppose
there
be
a
book
one
day
another
of
those
books
by
englishmen
about
poor
russians
and
you
flatter
yourself
that
now
at
last
one
true
picture
has
been
given
but
let
me
tell
you
that
you
never
know
anything
really
about
us
so
long
as
you
a
sentimentalist
yes
there
were
moments
when
i
hated
him
but
those
moments
never
continued
for
long
for
one
thing
one
could
not
hate
so
magnificent
so
honest
so
uncompromising
so
efficient
a
worker
he
was
worthy
of
some
very
high
position
in
the
army
and
he
could
certainly
have
attained
any
height
had
he
chosen
he
had
a
genius
for
compelling
other
men
to
obey
him
he
was
never
perturbed
by
unexpected
mischance
he
paid
no
attention
at
all
to
what
other
people
thought
of
him
and
he
seemed
incapable
of
fatigue
i
often
wondered
what
he
was
doing
here
why
he
had
chosen
so
small
an
otriad
as
ours
in
which
to
work
why
he
stayed
with
us
when
he
so
openly
despised
us
all
until
the
arrival
of
marie
ivanovna
there
was
no
answer
to
these
questions
after
that
the
answer
was
obvious
enough
again
one
could
not
hate
a
man
of
his
sterling
independence
of
character
we
were
all
of
us
i
think
emotionalists
of
one
kind
or
another
and
went
up
and
down
in
our
feelings
alliances
severances
trusts
and
distrusts
as
a
thermometer
goes
up
and
down
we
were
good
enough
people
in
our
way
but
we
were
most
certainly
not
a
strong
lot
even
nikitin
the
best
of
the
rest
of
us
was
a
dreamy
idealist
far
enough
from
life
as
it
was
and
quite
unprepared
to
come
down
from
his
dreams
and
see
things
as
they
were
but
semyonov
never
relaxed
for
an
instant
from
his
position
he
asked
no
man
help
nor
advice
minded
no
man
scorn
sought
no
man
love
during
my
experience
of
him
i
saw
him
moved
only
once
by
an
overmastering
emotion
and
that
was
of
course
his
love
for
marie
ivanovna
that
i
believe
master
him
but
deep
down
deep
down
he
kept
his
rebellions
his
anxieties
his
surmises
only
as
the
light
of
a
burning
house
is
seen
by
men
pale
and
faint
upon
the
sky
many
miles
from
the
conflagration
did
we
catch
signs
of
his
trouble
if
i
had
not
had
those
talks
with
trenchard
and
read
his
diary
i
should
have
known
nothing
even
now
i
can
offer
no
solution
meanwhile
he
showed
fiercely
and
openly
enough
his
love
for
marie
ivanovna
he
behaved
to
her
with
the
vulgarest
ostentation
as
a
rich
merchant
behaves
when
he
has
snatched
some
priceless
picture
from
a
defeated
rival
as
he
laughed
at
us
he
seemed
to
say
now
i
have
really
a
thing
of
value
here
you
are
all
of
you
too
stupid
to
realise
this
but
you
must
take
my
word
for
it
show
yourself
off
my
dear
and
let
them
all
see
marie
ivanovna
most
certainly
did
show
herself
off
the
beginning
of
his
trouble
was
that
he
could
not
do
with
her
as
he
pleased
she
had
fallen
into
his
hands
so
easily
that
he
thought
i
suppose
that
she
had
been
dying
of
love
for
him
from
the
first
moment
of
seeing
him
but
this
was
i
believe
very
far
from
the
truth
my
impression
of
her
acceptance
of
him
was
that
she
had
done
it
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
something
else
that
had
not
realised
all
the
consequences
of
accepting
any
more
than
she
had
realised
the
consequences
of
her
accepting
trenchard
was
obvious
from
the
first
she
simply
was
ignorant
of
life
and
at
the
same
time
wanted
to
cram
into
her
hands
the
full
sense
of
it
as
one
crushes
as
quickly
as
possible
she
admired
semyonov
it
may
be
that
she
loved
him
but
she
certainly
had
not
surrendered
herself
to
him
and
in
her
lively
ignorant
way
she
was
as
strong
as
he
during
the
first
weeks
of
her
engagement
she
was
as
she
had
been
at
her
first
arrival
amongst
us
as
happy
and
as
a
child
she
knew
that
we
disapproved
of
her
treatment
of
trenchard
but
she
thought
that
we
must
see
as
she
did
that
she
had
behaved
in
the
only
possible
way
once
again
she
was
straight
and
honest
to
the
world
and
she
could
behave
now
like
a
real
friend
of
her
john
that
strange
irrational
temper
that
she
had
shown
during
the
retreat
had
now
entirely
disappeared
she
approved
of
us
all
and
wished
us
to
approve
of
her
which
we
as
we
were
russians
and
could
not
possibly
dislike
pleasant
agreeable
people
whatever
there
might
be
against
them
speedily
did
she
was
charming
to
us
i
can
see
her
now
leaning
her
chin
on
her
hands
looking
at
us
the
colour
coming
and
going
delicately
in
her
cheek
like
flame
behind
china
her
delicacy
her
height
her
slender
figure
her
wide
childish
eyes
her
charmingly
ugly
large
mouth
and
short
nose
her
black
hair
the
appeal
of
her
ignorance
and
strength
and
credulity
ah
she
won
our
hearts
simply
whenever
she
pleased
of
course
we
disliked
her
when
she
was
rude
to
us
our
demanded
it
but
let
her
come
round
and
round
we
came
too
her
treatment
of
semyonov
was
strange
she
was
quite
fearless
laughing
at
his
temper
his
sarcasm
rebuking
his
selfishness
and
bad
manners
avoiding
his
coarse
and
unhesitating
and
above
all
trusting
him
in
the
oddest
way
as
though
in
spite
of
his
faults
she
placed
all
her
reliance
on
him
and
knew
that
he
would
not
fail
her
nothing
annoyed
him
more
than
her
behaviour
to
trenchard
it
would
of
course
be
absurd
to
say
that
he
was
jealous
of
trenchard
he
despised
the
man
too
deeply
and
was
himself
too
sure
of
his
lady
to
know
jealousy
but
he
was
irritated
by
the
attention
paid
to
him
irritated
even
by
the
attention
he
himself
paid
to
him
wherever
i
go
there
that
man
he
said
once
to
me
why
does
he
go
back
to
his
own
country
i
suppose
i
would
answer
hotly
he
has
other
things
to
do
than
to
consider
your
individual
wishes
alexei
petrovitch
then
he
would
laugh
well
well
ivan
andreievitch
you
sentimentalists
all
hang
together
why
ca
you
leave
him
alone
i
remember
that
i
continued
because
he
does
leave
me
alone
he
answered
shortly
it
was
of
course
marie
ivanovna
who
brought
them
together
she
could
not
see
or
rather
she
not
see
that
friendship
between
two
such
men
was
an
impossibility
for
herself
she
liked
trenchard
better
than
she
had
ever
done
she
had
now
no
responsibility
towards
him
we
were
all
fond
of
him
pleased
ourselves
by
saying
that
he
was
more
russian
than
english
the
sisters
mended
his
clothes
cared
for
his
stomach
and
listened
with
pleased
gravity
to
his
innocent
chatter
marie
ivanovna
was
now
really
proud
of
him
there
were
great
stories
of
the
courage
and
enterprise
he
had
shown
during
the
night
when
he
had
been
with
nikitin
nikitin
in
his
lofty
romantic
fashion
spoke
of
him
as
though
he
had
been
the
hero
of
the
russian
army
trenchard
was
of
course
quite
unspoiled
by
this
praise
and
popularity
he
remained
for
me
at
least
very
much
the
same
innocent
clumsy
pathetic
and
frequently
irritating
figure
that
he
had
been
at
the
beginning
i
will
honestly
confess
that
i
was
often
heartily
tired
of
his
glebeshire
stories
tired
too
of
a
certain
childish
obstinacy
with
which
he
clung
to
his
generally
crude
and
opinions
but
then
i
do
not
care
to
be
contradicted
by
people
of
whom
intellectually
i
have
a
low
estimation
it
is
one
of
my
most
unfortunate
weaknesses
i
had
no
opinion
of
trenchard
intellect
at
all
and
in
that
i
was
quite
wrong
semyonov
at
this
time
flung
nikitin
andrey
vassilievitch
trenchard
and
myself
into
one
basket
we
were
all
crazy
romantics
and
there
came
an
occasion
which
i
have
reason
most
clearly
to
remember
when
he
told
us
what
he
thought
of
us
we
were
together
semyonov
nikitin
trenchard
and
i
after
breakfast
smoking
cigarettes
enjoying
half
an
hour
idleness
before
setting
about
our
various
business
it
was
a
blazing
hot
morning
and
the
air
quivered
like
a
silver
curtain
before
our
eyes
separating
us
from
the
dim
blue
forest
of
s
beyond
the
river
the
nestor
itself
the
deep
green
slopes
of
our
own
hill
we
had
been
silent
then
trenchard
said
a
foolish
thing
war
brings
all
the
best
out
of
people
i
think
he
said
god
knows
what
private
line
of
thought
he
had
been
pursuing
some
sentimental
reflections
i
suppose
that
were
in
him
perfectly
honest
and
sincere
but
he
did
not
look
his
best
that
morning
sitting
back
in
his
chair
with
his
mouth
open
his
forehead
damp
with
the
heat
his
tunic
up
about
his
neck
and
a
rather
dirty
blue
in
his
hand
i
saw
semyonov
lip
curl
yes
that
very
interesting
he
said
i
glad
at
any
rate
that
we
had
the
honour
of
seeing
the
best
of
that
very
pleasant
to
know
what
i
mean
said
trenchard
blushing
and
stammering
what
that
is
i
agree
with
suddenly
said
nikitin
who
had
been
dreamily
watching
the
blue
forest
war
bring
out
the
best
in
the
human
character
always
semyonov
turned
smilingly
to
him
yes
vladimir
stepanovitch
we
know
your
illusions
forgive
me
for
insisting
that
they
are
illusions
i
would
not
disturb
your
romantic
happiness
for
the
world
you
ca
disturb
me
alexei
petrovitch
nikitin
answered
sleepily
what
a
hot
morning
no
said
semyonov
i
would
be
very
wrong
to
disturb
you
believe
me
i
never
tried
it
very
agreeable
to
me
to
see
you
and
so
happy
together
and
it
must
be
pleasant
for
both
of
you
to
feel
that
you
got
a
nice
god
all
of
your
own
who
sleeps
a
good
deal
but
still
on
the
whole
gives
you
what
you
want
we
may
wonder
a
little
what
has
done
to
be
so
favoured
never
very
much
i
fancy
but
still
i
like
the
friendliness
and
comfort
of
it
and
i
really
lucky
to
have
the
good
fortune
of
your
acquaintance
so
nice
for
russia
too
to
have
plenty
of
people
about
who
do
do
any
work
nor
take
any
trouble
about
anything
because
they
got
a
nice
fat
god
who
do
it
all
for
them
if
they
only
be
patient
thats
why
we
beating
the
germans
so
handsomely
the
poor
germans
who
only
ignorant
heathens
as
they
are
believe
in
themselves
he
looked
at
us
all
with
a
friendly
patronising
contempt
that
your
point
of
view
alexei
petrovitch
nikitin
answered
rather
hotly
think
as
you
please
of
course
but
there
more
in
life
than
you
can
see
there
is
indeed
of
course
there
is
said
semyonov
lazily
much
more
i
an
ignorant
rough
man
i
like
things
as
they
are
and
make
the
best
of
them
so
of
course
i
not
clever
clever
are
you
all
the
same
he
does
know
how
to
put
his
boots
on
properly
if
he
put
his
boots
on
better
and
knew
less
about
god
he
might
be
of
more
use
at
the
front
perhaps
that
only
my
idea
and
i
daresay
wrong
all
the
same
for
the
sake
of
the
comfort
the
pockets
of
all
of
us
i
do
hope
you
really
rouse
your
god
and
ask
him
to
do
something
sensible
something
with
method
in
it
and
a
few
more
bullets
in
it
and
a
little
more
efficiency
in
it
you
might
ask
him
to
do
what
he
can
he
looked
at
us
laughing
then
he
said
to
trenchard
but
do
you
fear
you
go
to
heaven
all
right
even
though
it
the
wise
men
who
succeed
in
this
world
i
do
doubt
it
the
fools
who
have
their
way
in
the
next
he
left
us
semyonov
was
with
every
new
day
more
baffled
by
marie
ivanovna
in
the
first
place
she
quietly
refused
to
obey
him
we
were
now
much
occupied
with
the
feeding
of
the
peasants
in
a
village
stricken
with
cholera
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
a
gloomy
enough
business
it
was
and
i
shall
have
very
shortly
to
speak
of
it
in
detail
for
the
moment
it
is
enough
to
say
that
two
of
us
went
off
every
morning
with
a
kitchen
on
wheels
distributed
the
food
and
returned
in
the
afternoon
semyonov
intensely
disliked
marie
ivanovna
share
in
this
work
but
he
could
not
of
course
object
to
her
taking
with
the
other
sisters
the
risks
and
unpleasantness
of
it
he
made
whenever
it
was
possible
objections
found
her
work
at
the
hospital
where
he
himself
was
occupied
her
in
every
possible
way
but
he
did
this
against
her
will
she
seemed
to
find
a
very
especial
pleasure
and
excitement
in
the
cholera
work
she
wished
often
to
take
the
place
of
some
other
sister
indeed
everything
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
seemed
to
have
a
great
fascination
for
her
she
herself
told
me
the
moment
i
cross
the
bridge
i
feel
as
though
i
were
on
enchanted
ground
on
the
occasions
when
i
accompanied
her
to
the
cholera
village
she
was
radiant
so
happy
that
she
seemed
to
have
nothing
further
in
the
world
to
desire
she
herself
was
puzzled
what
is
it
she
said
to
me
is
it
the
forest
it
must
be
i
think
the
forest
i
would
remain
on
this
side
for
ever
if
i
had
my
way
when
i
saw
semyonov
anxiety
about
her
i
could
not
but
remember
that
little
scene
at
the
battle
of
s
when
he
had
taken
her
off
with
him
leaving
trenchard
in
so
pitiful
a
condition
certainly
time
brings
in
his
revenges
and
marie
ivanovna
would
listen
to
nothing
that
he
said
i
want
you
at
the
hospital
this
morning
he
would
say
do
you
really
want
me
she
would
ask
looking
up
laughing
in
his
face
of
course
i
do
well
you
should
have
told
me
last
night
this
morning
i
go
with
anna
petrovna
to
the
cholera
all
is
arranged
i
afraid
you
must
change
your
plans
i
afraid
not
goga
may
go
no
i
wish
to
go
and
she
went
he
had
certainly
never
before
in
his
life
been
thus
defied
he
simply
did
not
know
what
to
do
about
it
if
he
had
thought
that
bullying
would
frighten
her
he
would
i
believe
have
bullied
her
but
he
knew
quite
well
that
it
would
and
then
as
i
now
began
to
perceive
i
had
at
first
thought
otherwise
he
was
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
experiencing
something
deeper
and
more
confusing
than
his
customary
animal
passions
he
may
at
first
have
wanted
marie
ivanovna
as
he
wanted
his
dinner
or
his
supper
now
he
wanted
her
differently
new
emotions
surprising
confusing
emotions
stirred
in
him
at
least
that
is
how
i
interpret
the
uneasiness
the
hesitation
which
i
now
seemed
to
perceive
in
him
he
was
no
longer
sure
of
himself
i
witnessed
just
at
this
time
a
little
scene
that
surprised
me
i
had
been
in
the
bandaging
room
alone
one
evening
cutting
up
bandages
i
was
going
through
the
passage
into
the
other
part
of
the
house
when
a
sound
stopped
me
i
could
not
avoid
seeing
beyond
the
open
door
a
little
scene
that
happened
so
swiftly
that
i
could
neither
retire
nor
advance
marie
ivanovna
and
semyonov
were
coming
together
towards
the
bandaging
room
she
was
in
front
of
him
when
he
put
his
hand
on
her
arm
do
you
love
me
he
said
in
a
low
voice
she
turned
round
to
him
laughing
yes
she
said
looking
at
him
then
kiss
me
no
not
now
why
not
now
i
do
want
to
why
do
you
want
to
she
shook
her
head
still
laughing
into
his
eyes
but
if
i
command
you
ah
then
i
certainly
will
not
his
hand
tightened
on
her
arm
and
she
did
not
draw
away
kiss
me
no
i
say
yes
i
say
no
he
suddenly
caught
her
held
her
to
him
as
though
he
would
kill
her
and
kissed
her
furiously
on
her
eyes
her
mouth
her
hair
with
his
violence
he
pushed
back
her
i
could
see
his
back
bent
like
a
bow
and
his
thick
short
legs
wide
apart
every
muscle
taut
she
lay
quite
motionless
as
though
asleep
in
his
arms
giving
him
no
response
then
quite
suddenly
she
flung
her
hands
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
as
passionately
as
he
had
kissed
her
at
last
they
parted
both
of
them
laughing
he
looked
at
her
and
then
with
a
gentleness
and
courtesy
that
i
had
never
seen
in
him
before
nor
dreamed
that
he
possessed
very
softly
kissed
her
hand
i
love
you
and
and
you
love
me
he
said
yes
i
love
you
she
answered
gravely
at
least
part
of
me
does
it
shall
be
all
of
you
soon
he
answered
if
there
time
enough
she
replied
time
i
follow
you
wherever
you
go
i
really
believe
you
will
she
answered
laughing
again
they
waited
then
looking
at
one
another
a
bell
rang
ah
i
hungry
supper
time
to
my
relief
they
passed
away
from
the
bandaging
room
towards
the
other
part
of
the
house
meanwhile
his
irritation
at
marie
ivanovna
kindness
to
trenchard
increased
with
every
hour
his
attitude
to
the
man
had
changed
since
trenchard
night
at
the
position
he
was
vexed
i
think
to
hear
that
the
fellow
had
proved
himself
a
man
and
a
practical
man
with
common
sense
semyonov
was
honest
about
this
he
did
not
doubt
word
he
even
congratulated
trenchard
but
he
certainly
disliked
him
more
than
ever
he
thought
i
suppose
as
he
had
thought
about
nikitin
how
can
a
man
with
his
wits
about
him
be
at
the
same
time
such
a
fool
and
then
he
saw
that
marie
ivanovna
was
delighted
with
trenchard
little
piece
of
good
luck
she
laughed
at
semyonov
about
it
we
all
know
you
a
very
brave
man
she
cried
but
you
not
so
brave
as
and
semyonov
because
he
knew
that
trenchard
was
a
fool
and
that
he
himself
was
not
was
vexed
as
a
bull
is
vexed
by
a
red
flag
these
things
made
him
think
a
great
deal
about
trenchard
i
have
seen
him
watching
him
with
angry
and
puzzled
gaze
as
though
he
would
satisfy
himself
why
this
gnat
of
a
man
worried
him
then
finally
was
andrey
vassilievitch
the
little
man
had
not
given
me
much
of
his
company
during
these
last
weeks
i
fancy
that
since
that
night
at
the
battle
of
s
when
he
had
revealed
his
terror
he
had
been
shy
of
me
although
god
knows
he
had
no
need
to
be
he
never
forgot
if
any
one
had
seen
him
in
an
unfortunate
position
and
although
he
bore
me
no
grudge
he
was
nervous
and
embarrassed
with
me
it
happened
however
that
during
this
same
week
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
i
had
a
conversation
with
him
i
was
standing
alone
by
the
cross
watching
a
long
trail
of
wagons
cross
the
bridge
far
beneath
me
watching
too
a
high
bank
of
black
cloud
that
was
passing
away
from
the
sky
above
the
forest
blown
by
a
wind
that
rolled
the
surface
of
the
river
into
silver
he
too
had
come
to
look
at
the
view
and
was
surprised
and
disturbed
at
finding
me
there
of
course
he
was
exaggerated
in
expressions
of
pleasure
why
ivan
andreievitch
this
is
delightful
he
cried
if
i
only
had
known
we
might
have
walked
here
together
we
sat
down
on
the
stone
seat
you
do
think
it
will
rain
he
asked
anxiously
no
those
clouds
are
going
away
i
see
well
this
is
delightful
and
then
sat
there
gloomily
looking
in
front
of
him
i
could
see
that
he
was
depressed
well
andrey
vassilievitch
i
said
to
him
you
depressed
about
something
yes
he
said
very
gloomily
indeed
i
have
many
unhappy
hours
ivan
andreievitch
i
did
not
get
up
and
leave
him
as
i
very
easily
might
have
done
i
had
had
since
the
night
when
nikitin
had
spoken
to
me
so
frankly
a
desire
to
know
the
little
man
side
of
that
affair
in
some
curious
fashion
that
silent
plain
wife
of
his
had
been
very
frequently
in
my
thoughts
there
had
not
been
enough
in
nikitin
account
to
explain
to
me
his
passion
for
her
and
yet
her
ghost
as
though
evoked
by
the
memories
both
of
nikitin
and
her
husband
had
seemed
to
me
sometimes
to
be
present
with
us
i
waited
tell
me
frankly
andrey
vassilievitch
said
at
last
am
i
of
any
use
here
of
use
i
repeated
taken
by
surprise
yes
am
i
doing
only
what
any
one
else
can
do
as
well
would
it
be
better
perhaps
if
another
were
here
no
certainly
not
i
answered
warmly
your
business
training
is
of
the
greatest
value
to
us
molozov
has
said
to
me
he
does
not
know
what
we
should
do
without
you
this
was
not
strictly
true
ah
the
little
man
was
greatly
pleased
i
am
glad
very
glad
to
hear
what
you
say
semyonov
made
me
feel
you
should
not
be
influenced
i
hurriedly
interrupted
him
by
what
semyonov
thinks
it
is
of
no
importance
he
has
a
bad
character
andrey
vassilievitch
said
suddenly
with
great
excitement
a
bad
character
and
why
can
not
he
leave
me
alone
why
should
he
laugh
always
i
do
my
best
i
am
quiet
and
not
in
his
way
i
can
do
things
that
he
can
not
i
am
not
big
as
he
but
at
least
i
do
not
rob
men
of
their
women
he
was
shaking
with
anger
his
head
trembling
and
his
hands
quivering
it
was
difficult
not
to
smile
you
must
not
listen
nor
notice
nor
think
of
it
i
said
firmly
we
are
grateful
for
your
work
all
of
us
semyonov
laughs
at
us
all
that
poor
marie
ivanovna
he
burst
out
she
does
not
know
she
is
ignorant
of
life
at
first
i
was
angry
with
her
but
now
i
see
that
she
is
helpless
there
will
be
terrible
things
afterwards
ivan
andreievitch
he
cried
i
think
she
understands
him
better
than
we
do
i
have
never
he
said
vehemently
hated
a
man
in
my
life
as
i
hate
him
but
in
spite
of
his
passionate
declaration
he
was
obviously
reassured
by
my
defence
of
him
he
was
quiet
suddenly
looked
at
the
view
mildly
and
in
a
moment
thought
me
the
best
friend
he
had
in
the
world
in
the
russian
manner
you
see
ivan
andreievitch
he
said
looking
at
me
with
the
eyes
of
an
unnaturally
wise
baby
that
i
can
not
help
wishing
that
my
wife
were
here
to
advise
marie
ivanovna
she
would
have
loved
my
wife
very
much
as
every
one
did
and
would
have
confided
in
her
that
would
have
helped
a
girl
who
like
marie
ivanovna
is
ignorant
of
the
world
and
the
loves
of
men
you
miss
your
wife
very
much
i
asked
there
is
not
a
moment
of
the
day
but
i
do
not
think
of
her
he
answered
very
solemnly
staring
in
front
of
him
that
must
seem
strange
to
you
who
did
not
know
her
and
even
i
sometimes
think
it
is
not
good
but
what
to
do
she
was
a
woman
so
remarkable
that
no
one
who
knew
her
can
forget
i
have
often
been
told
that
every
one
who
knew
her
loved
her
i
said
ah
you
have
heard
that
they
talk
of
her
of
course
she
will
always
be
remembered
his
eyes
shone
with
pleasure
yes
every
one
loved
her
i
myself
loved
her
with
a
passion
that
nothing
can
ever
change
and
why
i
can
not
tell
you
unless
it
were
that
she
was
the
only
person
i
have
known
who
did
not
wish
me
another
kind
of
man
i
could
be
myself
with
her
and
know
that
she
still
cared
for
me
i
will
not
pretend
to
you
ivan
andreievitch
that
i
think
myself
a
fine
man
he
continued
i
have
never
thought
myself
so
when
i
was
very
young
i
envied
tall
men
and
handsome
men
and
men
who
knew
what
was
the
best
thing
to
do
without
thinking
of
it
i
have
always
known
that
people
would
only
come
to
me
for
what
i
have
got
to
give
and
i
have
pretended
that
i
do
not
care
and
once
i
had
an
english
merchant
as
my
guest
he
was
very
agreeable
and
pleasant
to
me
and
then
by
chance
i
overheard
him
say
andrey
vassilievitch
a
vulgar
little
snob
that
is
perhaps
what
i
am
i
do
not
know
we
are
all
what
god
pleases
but
i
had
mistresses
i
had
friends
acquaintances
they
despised
me
they
left
me
always
for
some
one
finer
they
say
that
we
russians
care
too
much
what
others
think
of
us
but
when
in
your
own
house
people
your
friends
say
such
things
of
you
he
broke
off
then
smiling
continued
my
wife
came
there
was
something
in
me
just
as
i
was
that
she
cared
for
she
did
not
passionately
love
me
but
she
loved
me
with
her
heart
because
she
saw
that
i
needed
love
she
always
saw
people
just
as
they
were
and
i
understood
i
understood
from
the
beginning
exactly
what
i
was
to
her
he
paused
again
put
his
hand
on
my
knee
then
spoke
looking
very
serious
with
his
comic
little
nose
and
mouth
like
the
nose
and
mouth
of
a
poodle
i
had
a
friend
ivan
andreievitch
a
fine
man
he
loved
my
wife
and
my
wife
loved
him
he
was
not
vulgar
he
had
a
fine
taste
he
was
handsome
and
clever
what
was
i
to
do
i
knew
that
my
wife
loved
him
and
she
must
be
happy
i
knew
that
i
owed
her
everything
because
of
all
that
she
had
done
for
me
i
helped
them
in
their
love
for
five
years
i
wished
them
well
do
you
think
it
was
easy
for
me
i
suffered
ivan
andreievitch
the
tortures
of
hell
i
was
jealous
god
forgive
me
how
jealous
sometimes
alone
in
my
room
i
would
cry
all
night
not
a
fine
thing
to
do
but
then
how
should
i
act
she
gave
him
what
she
could
never
give
to
me
she
loved
him
with
passion
for
me
she
cared
as
good
women
care
for
the
poor
i
was
foolish
perhaps
i
tried
to
be
as
they
were
with
their
taste
and
easy
judgments
i
failed
of
course
what
could
i
do
all
at
once
one
is
as
god
has
pleased
from
the
beginning
ah
how
i
was
unhappy
those
five
years
i
wished
that
he
would
die
and
then
cursed
myself
for
wishing
it
and
yet
i
knew
that
i
had
something
that
he
had
not
i
needed
her
more
than
he
and
she
knew
that
her
charm
for
him
would
fade
perhaps
as
the
years
passed
he
was
a
passionate
man
who
had
loved
many
women
for
me
as
she
well
knew
it
would
never
pass
she
died
for
a
time
i
was
like
a
dead
man
and
she
was
not
enough
with
me
i
talked
to
her
friends
but
they
had
not
known
her
not
as
she
was
only
one
had
known
her
and
he
was
the
friend
whom
she
had
loved
of
course
he
found
me
as
he
had
always
done
tiresome
irritating
of
vulgar
taste
but
he
too
wanted
to
speak
of
her
and
so
we
were
drawn
together
now
is
he
my
friend
i
say
always
that
he
is
i
say
to
myself
vassilievitch
he
is
your
best
friend
but
i
am
jealous
yes

andreievitch
i
am
jealous
of
him
i
think
that
perhaps
he
will
die
before
me
and
that
then
somewhere
together
they
will
laugh
at
me
and
he
has
memories
of
her
at
the
last
she
cried
his
name
he
is
so
much
a
grander
man
than
i
fine
in
every
way
did
i
say
that
she
would
laugh
no
no
that
never
but
she
will
say
andrey
vassilievitch
she
will
pity
me
i
think
that
i
would
be
happier
if
i
did
not
see
my
friend
but
i
can
not
leave
him
we
talk
of
her
often
and
yet
he
despises
me
and
wonders
that
she
can
have
loved
me
i
had
a
fear
lest
andrey
vassilievitch
should
cry
he
seemed
so
desolate
there
giving
strange
little
coughs
and
sniffs
beating
the
ground
with
his
smart
little
military
boot
across
the
river
the
black
wall
of
cloud
had
returned
and
now
hung
above
the
forest
of
s
that
lay
sullenly
in
its
shadow
forbidding
and
thick
itself
like
a
cloud
the
world
was
cold
the
nestor
like
a
snake
i
shivered
seized
by
some
sudden
sense
of
coming
disaster
and
trouble
the
evenings
there
were
often
strangely
chill
look
cried
andrey
vassilievitch
starting
to
his
feet
marie
ivanovna
i
turned
and
saw
her
standing
there
smiling
at
us
silently
and
without
movement
like
an
apparition
chapter
ii
marie
ivanovna
it
was
on
july
that
i
first
entered
the
forest
of
s
i
did
not
i
remember
pay
the
event
any
especial
attention
i
went
with
anna
petrovna
to
the
cholera
village
that
is
on
the
outskirts
of
the
forest
and
i
recollect
that
we
hastened
back
because
that
evening
we
were
to
celebrate
the
conclusion
of
the
first
six
months
work
of
our
otriad
of
my
entrance
into
the
forest
i
remember
absolutely
nothing
it
seemed
i
suppose
an
ordinary
enough
forest
to
me
of
the
festivities
in
the
evening
i
have
a
very
clear
recollection
i
remember
that
it
was
the
loveliest
summer
weather
not
too
hot
with
a
little
breeze
coming
up
from
the
river
and
the
green
glittering
on
every
side
of
us
with
the
quiver
of
flashing
water
in
the
little
garden
outside
our
house
a
table
had
been
improvised
and
on
this
were
a
large
gilt
ikon
a
vase
of
flowers
in
a
hideous
purple
jar
and
two
tall
candles
whose
flames
looked
unreal
and
thin
in
the
sunlight
there
was
the
priest
a
fine
stout
man
with
a
long
black
beard
and
hair
falling
below
his
shoulders
clothed
in
silk
of
gold
and
purple
waving
a
censer
monotoning
the
prayers
in
a
high
russian
tenor
with
one
eye
on
the
choir
of
sanitars
one
eye
on
the
candles
blown
by
the
wind
the
breeze
meanwhile
playing
irreverent
jests
on
his
splendid
skirts
of
gold
then
there
was
the
congregation

and

passing

seeing
the

the

the

hearing
the
singing
they
would
take
off

and
the
moon
come
out
blown
straight
up
it
seems
out
of
the
bosom
of
the
nestor
it
was
a
very
happy
and
innocent
evening
for
extracting
the
utmost
happiness
possible
out
of
the
simplest
materials
the
russians
have
surely
no
rivals
how
our
generals
and
our
colonels
enjoyed
that
evening
a
wonderful
dinner
was
cooked
between
two
stones
in
the
garden
little
pig
young
chickens
that
most
luxurious
of
soups
and
ices
yes
and
ices
then
there
were
speeches
many
many
glasses
of
tea
strawberry
and
cherry
jam
biscuits
and
cigarettes
we
were
all
very
very
happy
it
was
arranged
on
the
morning
after
the
feast
that
i
should
go
again
to
the
cholera
village
with
marie
ivanovna
and
semyonov
under
a
morning
of
a
blazing
relentless
heat
bars
of
light
ruling
the
sky
we
started
the
three
of
us
at
about
ten
in
the
little
low
dogcart
followed
by
the
kitchen
and
the
boiler
marie
ivanovna
sat
next
to
semyonov
i
facing
them
semyonov
was
happier
than
i
had
ever
seen
him
before
happiness
was
not
a
quality
with
which
i
would
ever
have
charged
him
he
had
seemed
to
despise
it
as
something
too
simple
and
sentimental
for
any
but
sentimental
fools
but
now
this
morning
i
had
noticed
something
of
the
same
thing
in
him
the
evening
before
he
was
quite
happy
looking
younger
by
many
years
the
ironical
curve
of
his
lip
gone
his
eyes
smiling
his
attitude
to
the
world
gentle
and
almost
benevolent
of
course
she
marie
ivanovna
had
wrought
this
change
in
him
there
was
no
doubt
this
morning
that
she
loved
him
she
had
in
her
face
and
bearing
all
the
pride
and
also
all
the
humility
that
a
love
won
secured
ensured
brings
with
it
she
did
not
look
at
him
often
nor
take
his
hand
she
spoke
to
me
during
the
drive
and
only
once
and
again
smiled
up
at
him
but
her
soul
shining
through
the
thin
covering
of
her
body
laughed
to
me
crying
i
am
happy
because
i
have
my
desire
of
yesterday
i
remember
nothing
of
i
can
know
nothing
but
is
mine
he
was
very
quiet
when
he
looked
at
her
his
eyes
took
complete
possession
of
her
i
did
not
that
morning
count
at
all
to
either
of
them
but
i
too
felt
a
kind
of
pride
as
though
i
were
sharing
in
some
triumphal
procession
she
chattered
on
and
then
at
last
was
silent
i
remember
that
the
great
heat
of
the
morning
wrought
in
us
all
a
kind
of
lethargy
we
were
lazily
confident
that
day
that
nothing
evil
could
overtake
us
we
idly
watched
the
sky
the
river
the
approaching
forest
with
a
luxurious
reliance
on
the
power
of
man
and
i
caught
much
of
my
assurance
from
semyonov
himself
he
did
really
seem
to
me
that
morning
a
tremendous
figure
as
he
sat
there
so
still
so
triumphant
he
had
never
before
perhaps
been
quite
certain
of
marie
ivanovna
had
been
alarmed
at
her
independence
or
at
his
own
passionate
love
for
her
but
this
morning
he
she
loved
him
she
was
his
no
one
could
take
her
from
him
she
was
the
woman
he
wanted
as
he
had
never
wanted
a
woman
before
and
was
his
she
was
i
do
not
remember
our
entering
the
forest
i
know
that
first
you
climb
a
rough
rather
narrow
road
up
from
the
river
that
the
trees
close
about
you
very
gradually
that
there
is
a
little
church
with
a
green
turret
and
a
fine
view
of
the
nestor
and
that
there
a
broad
solemn
avenue
of
silver
birch
leads
you
forward
gently
and
without
any
sinister
omens
then
again
the
forest
clears
and
there
are
fields
of
corn
and
built
amongst
the
thin
scattering
of
trees
the
village
of
n
it
was
here
on
passing
the
first
houses
of
the
village
that
i
felt
the
heat
to
be
almost
unbearable
it
seemed
strange
to
me
i
remember
that
they
whoever
they
were
having
so
many
trees
here
a
forest
that
stretched
many
miles
behind
them
should
have
chosen
to
pitch
their
village
upon
the
only
exposed
and
torrid
bit
of
ground
that
they
could
find
behind
us
was
the
forest
in
front
of
us
also
the
forest
but
here
how
the
sun
blazed
down
on
the
roofs
and
little
blown
patches
of
garden
how
it
glared
in
through
the
broken
windows
and
penetrated
into
the
darkest
corners
of
the
desolate
rooms
poor
n
in
the
second
month
of
the
war
it
had
been
shelled
and
many
of
the
houses
destroyed
the
buildings
that
remained
seemed
to
have
given
up
the
struggle
and
abandoned
themselves
to
inevitable
degradation
moreover
down
the
principal
street
at
every
other
door
there
hung
the
sinister
black
flag
a
piece
of
dirty
black
cloth
fastened
to
a
stick
and
upon
the
filthy
wall
was
scrawled
in
russian
cholera
dead
indeed
under
the
appalling
heat
of
the
morning
the
whole
place
lay
no
one
was
to
be
seen
until
we
neared
the
ruins
of
what
had
once
been
a
little
or
a
procession
turned
the
corner
a
procession
of
a
peasant
with
a
tall
lighted
candle
another
peasant
with
a
tattered
banner
a
priest
in
soiled
silk
a
coffin
of
white
wood
on
a
haycart
and
four
or
five
and
apathetic
women
a
doleful
singing
came
from
the
miserable
party
they
did
not
look
at
us
as
we
passed
a
rumble
of
cannon
once
and
again
sounded
like
the
lazy
snore
of
some
sleeping
beast
near
the
we
found
a
company
of
fantastic
creatures
awaiting
us
they
were
pressed
together
in
a
dense
crowd
as
though
they
were
afraid
of
some
one
attacking
them
there
were
many
old
men
like
the
clowns
in
shakespeare
dirty
beyond
belief
in
tattered
garments
hats
broad
skirts
and
baggy
trousers
old
men
with
long
tangled
hair
bare
bony
breasts
and
slobbering
chins
many
of
the
women
seemed
strong
and
young
their
faces
were
on
the
whole
cheerful
a
brazen
indifference
to
anything
and
everything
was
their
attitude
there
were
many
children
two
gendarmes
guarded
them
with
rough
friendly
discipline
i
thought
that
i
had
seen
nothing
more
terrible
at
the
war
than
the
eager
pitiful
docility
with
which
they
moved
to
and
fro
in
obedience
to
the
gendarmes
orders
a
dreadful
broken
creeping
submission
but
it
was
their
fantasy
their
coloured
incredible
unreality
that
overwhelmed
me
the
building
black
and
twisted
against
the
hard
blue
sky
raised
its
head
behind
us
like
a
malicious
monster
before
us
this
crowd
all
tattered
faded
pieces
of
scarlet
and
yellow
and
blue
men
with
huge
noses
sunken
eyes
sharp
chins
long
skinny
hands
women
with
hard
bright
dead
faces
little
children
with
eyes
that
were
afraid
and
indifferent
hungry
and
mad
all
this
crowd
swaying
before
us
with
the
cannon
muttering
beyond
the
walls
and
the
thin
miserable
thread
of
the
funeral
hymn
trickling
like
water
under
our
feet
i
looked
from
these
to
semyonov
and
marie
ivanovna
they
in
their
white
overalls
working
at
the
meat
kitchen
and
the
huge
radiant
in
their
love
their
success
their
struggle
confident
both
of
them
this
morning
that
they
had
the
fire
of
life
in
their
hands
to
do
with
it
as
they
pleased
i
have
not
wished
during
the
progress
of
this
book
which
is
the
history
of
the
experiences
of
others
rather
than
of
myself
to
lay
any
stress
on
my
personal
history
and
here
i
would
only
say
that
any
one
who
is
burdened
with
a
physical
disease
or
encumbrance
that
will
remain
to
the
end
of
life
must
know
that
there
are
certain
moments
when
this
hindrance
leaps
up
at
him
like
the
grinning
face
of
a
devil
despairing
hideous
moments
they
are
i
have
said
that
during
our
drive
i
had
felt
a
confident
happy
participation
in
the
joy
of
those
others
who
were
with
me
now
as
we
stood
there
feeding
that
company
of
scarecrows
a
sudden
horror
of
my
own
lameness
a
sudden
consciousness
that
i
belonged
rather
to
that
band
of
miserable
diseased
hungry
fugitives
than
to
the
two
triumphant
figures
on
the
other
side
of
me
overwhelmed
and
defeated
me
i
bent
my
head
i
felt
a
shame
a
degradation
as
though
i
should
have
crept
into
some
shadow
and
hidden
i
would
not
mention
this
were
it
not
that
afterwards
in
retrospect
the
moment
seemed
to
me
an
omen
after
all
life
is
not
always
to
the
victorious
our
scarecrows
wanted
horribly
their
food
it
was
dreadful
to
see
the
anxiety
with
which
they
watched
the
portioning
of
the
thick
heavy
hunks
of
black
bread
they
had
to
show
marie
ivanovna
their
dirty
little
scraps
of
paper
which
described
the
portions
to
which
they
were
entitled
how
their
bony
fingers
clutched
the
paper
afterwards
as
they
pressed
it
back
into
their
skinny
bosoms
sometimes
they
could
not
wait
to
return
home
but
would
squat
down
on
the
ground
and
lap
their
soup
like
dogs
the
day
grew
hotter
and
hotter
the
world
smelt
of
disease
and
dirt
waste
and
desolation
marie
ivanovna
face
was
soft
with
tenderness
as
she
watched
them
semyonov
had
always
his
eye
upon
her
seeing
that
she
did
not
touch
them
sometimes
calling
out
sharply
now
marie
take
care
take
care
but
this
morning
he
also
seemed
kind
and
gentle
to
them
leading
a
small
girl
back
to
her
haggard
bony
old
guardian
carrying
her
heavy
can
of
soup
for
her
or
joking
with
some
of
the
old
men
now
uncle
you
ought
to
be
at
the
war
what
have
they
done
leaving
you
so
young
and
so
vigorous
they
take
you
yet
and
the
old
man
a
toothless
trembling
creature
clutching
his
hunk
of
bread
with
shaking
hands
would
grin
like
the
head
of
death
himself
how
close
to
death
they
all
seemed
how
alive
were
my
friends
strong
in
the
sun
compassionate
but
also
perhaps
a
little
despising
this
poor
gathering
of
wastrels
the
work
went
on
then
at
last
the
final
scraps
of
meat
and
bread
had
been
shared
the
kitchen
closed
its
oven
we
took
off
our
overalls
shook
ourselves
and
bade
farewell
to
the
scarecrows
the
kitchen
was
then
sent
home
and
we
moved
forward
with
the
tea
boiler
and
two
sanitars
further
into
the
forest
our
destination
was
a
large
empty
house
behind
the
trenches
from
here
we
were
to
take
tea
in
the
boiler
to
certain
regiments
tea
with
wine
in
it
as
preventative
against
cholera
it
was
the
early
afternoon
now
and
we
moved
very
slowly
the
heat
was
intense
and
although
the
trees
were
thick
on
every
side
of
us
there
seemed
to
be
no
shade
nor
coolness
as
though
the
leaves
had
been
made
of
paper
this
is
a
strange
forest
i
said
although
there
are
trees
no
shade
it
burns
like
a
furnace
no
one
replied
we
passed
as
though
in
a
dream
meeting
no
one
hearing
no
sound
the
light
dancing
and
flickering
on
our
path
i
nodded
on
my
seat
i
was
half
asleep
when
we
arrived
at
our
destination
this
was
the
accustomed
white
deserted
house
standing
in
a
desolate
tangled
garden
there
was
no
one
there
on
our
arrival
all
the
doors
were
open
the
sun
blazing
along
the
dusty
passages
it
was
inhabited
just
then
i
believe
by
some
artillery
officers
but
i
saw
none
of
them
semyonov
went
off
to
find
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
to
whom
we
were
to
give
tea
marie
ivanovna
and
i
remained
in
one
of
the
empty
rooms
the
only
sound
the
buzzing
flies
every
detail
of
that
room
will
remain
in
my
heart
and
brain
until
i
die
marie
ivanovna
looking
very
white
and
cool
with
the
happiness
shining
in
her
large
clear
eyes
sat
on
an
old
worn
sofa
near
the
window
in
the
glass
of
the
window
there
were
bullet
holes
and
beyond
the
window
a
piece
of
blazing
golden
garden
the
room
was
very
dirty
dust
lay
thick
upon
everything
some
one
had
eaten
a
meal
there
and
there
was
a
plate
a
knife
also
an
empty
and
a
hunk
of
black
bread
there
was
a
book
which
i
picked
up
attracted
by
the
english
lettering
on
the
faded
red
cover
it
was
a
report
on
the
condition
of
new
mexico
in
a
heavy
fat
volume
with
the
usual
photographs
of
cornfields
and
enormous
sheep
on
the
walls
there
was
only
one
picture
a
torn
supplement
from
some
german
magazine
showing
father
returning
to
his
family
after
a
long
absence
welcomed
of
course
by
child
fat
and
ugly
wife
fatter
and
uglier
and
dog
a
mongrel
there
was
the
usual
pile
of
fiction
in
polish
translations
i
suspect
of
conan
doyle
and
jerome
there
was
a
desolate
palm
in
a
corner
and
a
chipped
blue
washing
stand
a
hideous
place
the
sun
did
not
penetrate
and
it
should
have
been
cool
but
for
some
reason
the
air
was
heavy
and
hot
as
though
we
were
enclosed
in
a
i
leaned
against
the
table
and
looked
at
marie
ivanovna
is
it
strange
i
said
we
only
a
verst
or
two
from
the
austrians
and
not
a
sound
to
be
heard
but
the
gendarme
told
me
that
we
must
be
careful
here
a
good
many
bullets
flying
about
i
believe
ah
she
said
laughing
i
do
feel
as
though
anything
could
touch
me
i
never
loved
life
before
as
i
love
it
now
is
it
right
to
be
so
happy
at
such
a
time
as
this
and
in
such
a
place
and
how
strange
it
is
that
through
all
the
tragedy
one
can
only
truly
see
one
own
little
affairs
and
only
feel
one
own
little
troubles
and
joys
that
bad
one
should
be
punished
for
that
i
loved
her
at
that
moment
i
felt
bitterly
i
remember
that
i
because
i
was
plain
and
a
cripple
silent
and
uninteresting
would
never
win
the
love
of
such
women
i
remembered
little
andrey
vassilievitch
words
about
his
wife
for
me
she
cared
as
good
women
care
for
the
poor
in
that
way
for
me
too
women
would
care
when
they
cared
at
all
and
always
all
my
life
it
would
be
like
that
how
unfair
that
everything
should
be
given
to
the
semyonovs
and
the
nikitins
of
this
world
everything
denied
to
such
men
as
trenchard
andrey
vassilievitch
and
i
but
my
little
grumble
passed
as
i
looked
at
her
how
honest
and
straight
and
true
with
her
impulses
her
enthusiasms
her
rebellions
and
ignorances
she
was
yes
i
loved
her
and
had
always
loved
her
that
was
why
i
had
cared
for
trenchard
why
now
i
was
attracted
by
semyonov
because
shadow
of
a
man
as
i
was
not
man
enough
to
be
jealous
i
could
see
with
her
eyes
stand
beside
her
and
share
her
emotion
but
god
how
that
day
i
despised
myself
you
tired
she
said
looking
at
me
is
your
leg
hurting
you
not
much
i
answered
sit
down
here
beside
me
she
made
way
for
me
on
the
sofa
ivan
andreievitch
you
will
always
be
my
friend
always
i
answered
i
believe
you
will
i
a
little
afraid
of
you
but
i
think
that
i
would
rather
have
you
as
a
friend
than
any
one
except
john
how
fortunate
i
am
two
englishmen
for
my
friends
you
do
not
change
as
do
you
will
be
angry
with
me
when
you
think
that
i
am
wrong
but
then
i
can
believe
you
i
know
that
you
will
tell
me
the
truth
perhaps
i
said
slowly
alexei
petrovitch
will
not
wish
that
i
should
be
your
friend
alexei
she
said
laughing
oh
thank
you
very
much
i
shall
choose
my
own
friends
that
will
always
be
my
affair
i
had
an
uneasy
suspicion
that
perhaps
she
knew
as
little
about
semyonov
as
she
had
once
known
about
trenchard
it
might
be
that
all
her
life
she
might
never
learn
wisdom
i
do
not
know
that
i
wished
her
to
learn
it
no
she
continued
but
you
forgive
me
now
forgive
me
for
all
my
mistakes
for
thinking
that
i
loved
john
when
i
did
not
and
treating
him
so
badly
ah
but
how
unhappy
i
was
i
wished
to
be
honourable
and
honest
i
wished
it
passionately
and
i
seemed
only
to
make
mistakes
and
then
because
i
was
ashamed
of
myself
i
was
angry
with
every
one
at
least
it
seemed
that
it
was
with
every
one
but
it
was
really
with
myself
i
did
you
injustice
i
said
and
i
did
alexei
petrovitch
an
injustice
also
i
know
now
that
he
truly
and
deeply
loves
you
i
believe
that
you
will
be
very
happy
yes
it
is
better
much
better
than
that
you
should
have
married
trenchard
her
face
flushed
with
happiness
that
strange
flush
of
colour
behind
her
pale
cheeks
coming
and
going
with
the
beats
of
her
heart
she
continued
happily
confidently
when
i
was
growing
up
i
was
always
restless
my
mother
allowed
me
to
do
as
i
pleased
and
i
had
no
one
in
authority
over
me
i
was
restless
because
i
knew
nothing
and
no
one
could
tell
me
anything
that
seemed
to
me
true
i
would
have
like
other
girls
sudden
enthusiasms
for
some
one
who
seemed
strong
and
wonderful
and
then
they
were
never
wonderful
only
like
every
one
else
i
would
be
angry
impatient
miserable
russian
girls
begin
life
so
early
after
a
time
mother
began
to
treat
me
as
though
i
was
grown
up
we
went
to
petrograd
and
i
thought
about
clothes
and
theatres
but
i
never
forgot
i
always
waited
for
the
man
or
the
work
or
the
friend
that
was
to
make
life
real
then
suddenly
the
war
came
and
i
thought
that
i
had
found
what
i
wanted
but
there
too
there
were
disappointments
john
was
not
john
the
war
was
not
the
war
and
it
only
now
that
i
feel
as
though
i
were
inside
been
so
stupid
i
made
so
many
mistakes
she
dropped
her
voice
i
always
been
afraid
ivan
andreievitch
that
is
the
truth
you
remember
that
morning
before
s
yes
i
said
i
remember
it
well
it
has
been
often
often
like
that
i
been
afraid
of
myself
and
of
something
else
of
dying
i
found
that
i
did
want
to
die
that
the
thought
of
death
was
too
horrible
to
me
that
day
of
the
retreat
how
afraid
i
was
john
could
not
protect
me
no
one
could
and
i
was
ashamed
of
myself
how
ashamed
how
miserable
and
i
was
afraid
because
i
thought
of
myself
more
than
of
any
one
else
always
i
had
fine
ideals
but
in
practice
it
was
only
that
that
i
always
was
selfish
now
for
the
first
time
ever
i
care
for
some
one
more
than
myself
and
suddenly
i
am
afraid
of
death
no
longer
it
is
true
ivan
andreievitch
i
do
not
believe
that
death
can
separate
alexei
from
me
i
have
more
reason
now
to
wish
to
live
than
i
have
ever
had
but
now
i
am
not
afraid
wherever
i
am
alexei
will
come
wherever
he
is
i
will
go
she
broke
off
then
laughed
you
think
it
silly
in
england
to
talk
about
such
things
no
english
girl
would
would
she
in
russia
we
are
silly
if
we
like
but
oh
how
happy
it
is
after
all
these
weeks
not
to
be
afraid
not
to
wake
up
early
and
lie
there
and
think
think
and
shudder
they
used
to
say
i
was
brave
about
the
wounded
brave
at
s
brave
at
operations
if
they
only
knew
you
only
ivan
andreievitch
have
seen
me
afraid
you
only
she
looked
at
me
her
eyes
searching
my
face
is
it
strange
that
you
who
do
not
love
me
know
me
perhaps
better
than
john
and
yes
better
than
alexei
that
why
i
tell
you
i
can
talk
to
you
i
never
could
talk
to
women
i
never
cared
for
women
you
and
john
for
my
friends
yes
i
am
indeed
happy
she
got
up
from
the
old
sofa
walked
a
little
about
the
room
looked
at
the
remains
of
the
meal
at
the
book
then
turned
round
to
me
do
ever
tell
any
one
ivan
andreievitch
that
i
have
been
afraid
i
never
to
be
afraid
again
and
i
not
going
to
die
i
know
now
that
life
is
wonderful
at
last
all
that
when
i
was
young
i
expected
it
to
be
do
you
know
ivan
andreievitch
i
feel
as
though
i
would
live
for
ever
semyonov
came
in
he
was
in
splendid
spirits
i
had
never
seen
him
so
gay
so
carelessly
happy
well
he
cried
to
me
we
to
go
now
at
once
and
the
next
time
at
eight
we
leave
you
this
time
we
be
back
by
six
we
do
the
third
and
fourth
roti
now
the
eighth
and
ninth
afterwards
can
you
wait
for
tea
until
we
return
good
six
then
they
departed
as
she
went
out
of
the
door
she
turned
and
gave
me
a
little
happy
smile
as
though
to
bind
me
to
an
intimate
enduring
confidence
i
smiled
back
at
her
and
she
was
gone
after
they
had
left
me
i
felt
very
lonely
the
house
was
still
and
desolate
and
i
took
a
book
that
i
had
brought
with
me
the
le
deuil
des
primeveres
of
françois
jammes
i
had
learnt
the
habit
during
my
first
visit
to
the
war
of
always
taking
a
book
in
my
pocket
when
engaged
upon
any
business
there
were
so
many
long
weary
hours
of
waiting
when
the
nerves
were
stretched
and
a
book
quiet
and
real
and
something
apart
from
all
wars
and
all
rumours
of
wars
was
a
most
serious
necessity
what
tristram
shandy
was
to
me
once
under
fire
near
nijnieff
and
on
an
awful
morning
when
our
whole
otriad
meditated
on
the
possibility
of
imprisonment
before
the
evening
with
nothing
to
be
done
but
sit
and
wait
i
went
into
the
garden
with
jammes
as
i
walked
along
the
little
paths
through
a
tangle
of
wood
and
green
that
might
very
well
have
presented
the
garden
of
the
sleeping
beauty
i
heard
now
and
then
a
sound
that
resembled
the
swift
flight
of
a
bird
or
the
sudden
ting
of
a
the
austrians
were
amusing
themselves
sometimes
a
bullet
would
clip
a
tree
in
its
passing
or
one
would
see
a
leaf
quite
suddenly
detached
hover
for
a
moment
idly
in
the
air
and
then
circle
slowly
to
the
ground
except
for
this
sound
the
garden
was
fast
held
in
the
warm
peace
of
a
summer
afternoon
i
found
a
most
happy
little
neglected
orchard
with
old
gnarled
and
thick
waving
grass
here
i
lay
on
my
back
watching
the
gold
through
the
leaves
soaked
in
the
apathy
and
somnolence
of
the
day
sinking
idly
into
sleep
rising
sinking
again
as
though
rocked
in
a
hammock
i
was
in
england
once
more
at
intervals
there
came
a
sharp
click
that
exactly
resembled
the
sound
that
one
hears
in
an
english
village
on
a
summer
afternoon
when
they
are
playing
cricket
in
the
field
near
by
oneself
at
one
ease
in
the
garden
half
sleeping
half
building
castles
in
the
air
the
crack
of
the
ball
on
the
bat
the
cooing
of
some
pigeons
on
the
roof
once
again
that
sharp
pleasant
sound
again
the
flight
of
the
bird
above
one
head
again
the
rustle
of
some
leaves
behind
one
head
soon
there
will
be
tea
strawberries
and
cream
a
demand
that
one
shall
play
tennis
that
saunter
through
the
cool
dark
house
up
old
stairs
along
narrow
passages
to
one
room
where
one
will
slowly
happily
change
into
flannels
hearing
still
through
the
open
window
the
crack
of
the
bat
upon
the
ball
from
the
distant
field
but
as
i
lay
there
i
was
unhappy
rebellious
the
confidence
and
splendour
of
marie
ivanovna
and
semyonov
had
driven
me
into
exile
i
hated
myself
that
afternoon
that
pursuit
the
excitement
of
the
penetration
into
the
dark
forest
the
thrill
of
the
chase
those
things
were
for
the
strong
men
the
brave
women
not
for
the
halt
and
maimed
not
love
nor
glory
neither
hate
nor
fierce
rebellion
were
for
such
men
as
i
i
cursed
my
fate
my
life
because
i
loved
not
for
the
first
time
a
woman
who
was
glad
that
i
did
not
love
her
and
was
so
sure
that
i
did
not
and
could
not
that
she
could
proclaim
her
satisfaction
openly
to
me
i
had
an
hour
of
bitterness
then
as
i
had
so
often
done
before
i
laughed
drove
the
little
devil
into
his
cage
locked
it
dropped
the
thick
curtain
in
front
of
it
i
claimed
the
company
of
françois
jammes
he
has
a
delightful
poem
about
donkeys
and
as
i
read
it
i
regained
my
tranquillity
it
begins
faudra
aller
vers
vous
ô
mon
dieu
faites
que
ce
soit
par
un
jour
ou
la
campagne
en
fete
poudroiera
je
désire
ainsi
que
je
fis
choisir
un
chemin
pour
aller
comme
il
me
plaira
au
paradis
où
sont
en
plein
jour
les
étoiles
je
prendrai
mon
bâton
et
sur
la
grande
route
et
je
dirai
aux
ânes
mes
amis
je
suis
francois
jammes
et
je
vais
au
paradis
car
il
a
pas
au

leur
dirai

du

pauvres
bêtes
chéries
qui
brusque

les
mouches
plates
les
coups
et
les

that
brought
tranquillity
back
to
me
i
found
another
poem
his

et

i
was
asleep
my
eyes
closed
the
book
fell
from
my
hand
some
one
near
me
seemed
to
repeat
in
the
air
the
words

i
was
rocked
in
the
hot
golden
air
i
slept
heavily
deeply
without
dreams
i
was
awakened
by
a
cold
fierce
apprehension
of
terror
i
sat
up
stared
slowly
around
me
with
the
sure
certain
conviction
that
some
dreadful
thing
had
occurred
the
orchard
was
as
it
had
been
the
sun
lower
now
shone
through
the
green
branches
all
was
still
and
even
as
i
listened
i
heard
the
sharp
crack
of
the
ball
upon
the
bat
breaking
the
evening
air
my
heart
had
simply
ceased
to
beat
i
remember
that
with
a
hand
that
trembled
i
picked
up
the
book
that
was
lying
open
on
the
grass
and
read
without
understanding
them
the
words
i
remember
that
i
said
out
aloud
something
happened
then
turning
saw
semyonov
face
i
realised
nothing
save
his
face
with
its
pale
square
beard
and
red
lips
framed
there
by
the
shining
green
and
blue
he
stood
there
without
moving
staring
at
me
and
the
memory
of
his
eyes
even
now
as
i
write
of
it
hurts
me
physically
so
that
my
own
eyes
close
that
was
perhaps
the
worst
moment
of
my
life
that
confrontation
of
semyonov
he
stood
there
as
though
carved
in
stone
his
figure
had
always
the
stiff
clear
outline
of
stone
or
wood
i
realised
nothing
of
his
body
i
simply
saw
his
eyes
that
were
staring
straight
in
front
of
him
that
were
blazing
with
pain
and
yet
were
blind
he
looked
past
me
and
if
one
had
not
seen
the
live
agony
of
his
eyes
one
would
have
thought
that
he
was
absorbed
in
watching
something
that
was
so
distant
that
he
must
concentrate
all
his
attention
upon
it
i
got
upon
my
feet
and
as
my
eyes
met
his
i
knew
without
any
question
at
all
that
marie
ivanovna
was
dead
when
i
had
risen
we
stood
for
a
moment
facing
one
another
then
without
a
word
he
turned
towards
the
house
i
followed
him
leaving
my
book
upon
the
grass
he
walking
slowly
in
front
of
me
with
his
usual
assured
step
except
that
once
he
walked
into
a
bush
that
was
to
his
right
he
afterwards
came
away
from
it
as
a
man
walking
in
his
sleep
might
do
without
lowering
his
eyes
to
look
at
it
we
entered
by
a
i
myself
had
no
thoughts
at
all
at
this
time
i
felt
only
the
cold
heavy
oppression
at
my
heart
and
i
had
i
remember
no
curiosity
as
to
what
had
occurred
we
passed
through
passages
that
were
strangely
dark
in
a
silence
that
was
weighted
and
mysterious
we
entered
the
room
where
we
had
been
earlier
in
the
afternoon
it
seemed
now
to
be
full
of
people
i
saw
now
quite
clearly
although
just
before
the
whole
world
had
seemed
to
be
dark
i
saw
our
two
soldiers
standing
back
by
the
door
a
doctor
whose
face
i
did
not
know
a
very
corpulent
man
was
on
his
knees
on
the
floor
some
sanitars
were
in
a
group
by
the
window
in
the
middle
of
the
room
lay
marie
ivanovna
on
a
stretcher
even
as
i
entered
the
stout
doctor
rose
shaking
his
head
i
had
only
that
one
glimpse
of
her
face
on
my
entry
because
at
the
shake
of
the
doctor
head
a
sanitar
stepped
forward
and
covered
her
with
a
cloth
but
i
shall
see
her
face
as
it
was
until
i
die
her
eyes
were
closed
she
seemed
very
peaceful
but
i
can
not
write
of
it
even
now
my
business
here
is
simply
with
facts
and
i
must
be
forgiven
if
now
i
am
brief
in
my
account
the
room
was
just
as
it
had
been
earlier
in
the
afternoon
i
saw
the
the
dirty
plate
that
had
a
little
cloud
of
flies
upon
it
the
room
seemed
under
the
evening
sun
full
of
gold
dust
i
crossed
over
to
our
soldiers
and
asked
them
how
it
had
been
one
of
them
told
me
that
they
had
gone
with
the
boiler
to
the
trenches
everything
had
been
very
quiet
they
had
taken
their
stand
behind
a
small
ruined
house
semyonov
had
just
returned
from
telling
the
officers
of
the
rota
that
the
tea
was
ready
when
quite
suddenly
the
austrians
had
begun
to
fire
bullets
had
passed
thickly
overhead
marie
ivanovna
had
seemed
quite
fearless
and
laughing
had
stepped
for
a
moment
from
behind
the
shelter
to
see
whether
the
soldiers
were
coming
for
their
tea
she
was
struck
instantly
she
gave
a
sharp
little
cry
and
fell
they
rushed
to
her
side
but
death
had
been
instantaneous
she
had
been
struck
in
the
heart
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
the
soldiers
seemed
to
feel
it
very
deeply
and
one
of
them
a
little
round
fellow
with
a
merry
face
whom
i
knew
well
turned
away
from
me
and
began
to
cry
with
his
hand
to
his
eyes
semyonov
was
standing
in
the
room
with
exactly
that
same
dead
burning
expression
in
his
eyes
his
mouth
was
set
severely
his
legs
apart
his
hands
at
his
sides
a
terrible
misfortune
i
heard
the
stout
doctor
say
semyonov
looked
at
him
gravely
thank
you
very
much
for
your
kindness
he
said
courteously
then
by
a
common
instinct
without
any
spoken
word
between
us
we
all
went
from
the
room
leaving
semyonov
alone
there
i
remember
very
little
of
our
return
to
mittövo
we
borrowed
a
cart
upon
which
we
laid
the
body
i
sat
in
the
trap
with
semyonov
i
was
i
remember
afraid
lest
he
should
suddenly
go
off
his
head
it
seemed
quite
a
possible
thing
then
he
was
so
quiet
so
motionless
scarcely
breathing
i
concentrated
all
my
thought
upon
this
i
had
my
hand
upon
his
arm
and
i
remember
that
it
relieved
me
in
some
way
to
feel
it
so
thick
and
strong
beneath
his
sleeve
he
did
not
look
at
me
once
i
do
not
know
what
my
thoughts
were
a
confused
incoherent
medley
of
nonsense
i
did
not
think
of
marie
ivanovna
at
all
i
repeated
again
and
again
to
myself
in
the
silly
insane
way
that
one
does
under
the
shock
of
some
trouble
the
words
of
the
poem
that
i
had
read
that
afternoon
crusoë
passa
par
amsterdam
je
crois
du
moins
y
passa
en
revenant
de
ombreuse
et
verte
ombreuse
et
verte
ombreuse
et
verte
it
was
dark
or
at
any
rate
it
seemed
to
me
dark
the
weather
was
still
and
close
every
sound
echoed
abominably
through
the
silence
when
we
arrived
at
mittövo
i
suddenly
thought
of
trenchard
i
had
utterly
forgotten
him
until
that
moment
i
got
out
of
the
trap
and
when
semyonov
climbed
out
he
put
his
hand
on
my
arm
i
do
know
why
but
that
touched
me
so
deeply
and
sharply
that
i
felt
suddenly
as
though
in
another
instant
i
should
lose
my
it
was
so
unlike
him
so
utterly
unlike
him
to
do
that
i
trembled
a
little
then
steadied
myself
and
we
walked
together
into
the
house
they
must
all
instantly
have
known
what
had
occurred
because
i
heard
running
steps
and
sharp
anxious
voices
i
felt
desperately
as
a
man
runs
when
he
is
afraid
that
i
must
be
alone
i
slipped
away
into
the
passage
that
leads
from
the
hall
this
passage
was
quite
dark
and
i
was
feeling
my
direction
with
my
hands
when
some
one
carrying
a
candle
turned
the
corner
it
was
trenchard
he
raised
the
candle
high
to
look
at
me
hallo
durward
he
cried
you
back
what
sort
of
a
time
i
told
him
at
once
what
had
occurred
the
candle
dropped
from
his
hand
falling
with
a
sharp
clatter
there
was
a
horrible
pause
both
of
us
standing
there
close
to
one
another
in
the
sudden
blackness
i
could
hear
his
fast
nervous
breathing
i
was
myself
unstrung
i
suppose
because
i
remember
that
i
was
dreadfully
afraid
lest
trenchard
should
do
something
to
me
there
as
we
stood
i
felt
his
hand
groping
on
my
clothes
but
he
was
only
feeling
his
way
i
heard
his
steps
creeping
stumbling
down
the
passage
once
i
thought
that
he
had
fallen
then
there
was
silence
and
at
last
i
was
alone
chapter
iii
the
forest
and
now
i
am
confronted
with
a
very
serious
difficulty
there
is
nothing
stranger
in
this
whole
business
of
the
life
and
character
of
war
than
the
fashion
in
which
an
atmosphere
that
has
been
of
the
intensest
character
can
by
the
mere
advance
or
retreat
of
a
pace
or
two
disappear
close
in
upon
itself
present
the
blindest
front
to
the
soul
that
has
a
moment
before
penetrated
it
it
is
as
though
one
had
visited
a
house
for
the
first
time
the
interior
is
of
the
most
absorbing
and
unique
interest
there
are
revealed
in
it
beauties
terrors
of
so
sharp
a
reality
that
one
believes
that
one
life
is
changed
for
ever
by
the
sight
of
them
one
passes
the
door
closes
it
behind
one
steps
into
the
outer
world
looks
back
and
there
is
only
before
one
view
a
thick
cold
wall
the
windows
are
dead
there
is
no
sound
only
bland
dull
expressionless
space
moreover
this
dull
wall
almost
instantly
persuades
one
of
the
incredibility
of
what
one
has
seen
there
were
no
beauties
there
were
no
terrors
ordinary
life
closes
round
one
trivial
things
reassume
their
old
importance
one
disbelieves
in
fantastic
dreams
i
believe
that
every
one
who
has
had
experience
of
war
will
admit
the
truth
of
this
i
had
myself
already
known
something
of
the
kind
and
had
wondered
at
the
fashion
in
which
the
crossing
of
a
mere
verst
or
two
can
bring
the
old
life
about
one
i
had
known
it
during
the
battle
of
s
in
the
days
that
followed
the
battle
in
moments
of
the
retreat
when
for
half
an
hour
we
would
suddenly
be
laughing
and
careless
as
though
we
were
in
petrograd
and
so
when
i
look
back
to
the
weeks
of
whose
history
i
wish
now
to
give
a
truthful
account
i
am
afraid
of
myself
i
wish
to
give
nothing
more
than
the
facts
and
yet
that
something
that
is
than
the
facts
is
of
the
first
and
indeed
the
only
importance
moreover
the
last
impression
that
i
wish
to
convey
is
that
war
is
a
business
i
believe
that
that
succession
of
days
in
the
forest
of
s
the
experience
of
nikitin
semyonov
andrey
vassilievitch
trenchard
and
myself
might
have
occurred
to
any
one
must
have
occurred
to
many
other
persons
but
from
the
cool
safe
foundation
on
which
now
i
stand
it
can
not
but
seem
exceptional
even
exaggerated
exaggerated
in
very
truth
i
know
that
it
is
not
and
yet
this
life
so
ordered
so
disciplined
so
rational
and
that
life
where
do
they
join
i
penetrated
but
a
little
way
my
friends
penetrated
into
the
very
heart
and
because
i
was
left
outside
i
remain
the
only
possible
recorder
but
a
recorder
who
can
offer
only
signs
moments
glimpses
through
a
closing
door
i
am
waiting
now
for
the
return
of
my
opportunity
on
the
night
of
the
death
of
marie
ivanovna
i
slept
a
heavy
dreamless
sleep
i
was
wakened
between
six
and
seven
the
next
morning
by
nikitin
who
told
me
that
he
trenchard
andrey
vassilievitch
and
i
were
to
return
at
once
to
the
forest
i
realised
at
once
that
indescribable
quiver
in
the
air
of
momentous
events
the
house
was
quite
still
the
summer
morning
very
fresh
and
clear
but
the
air
was
weighted
with
some
crisis
it
was
not
only
the
death
of
marie
ivanovna
that
was
present
with
us
it
was
rather
something
that
told
us
that
now
no
individual
life
or
death
counted
individualities
personalities
were
swallowed
up
in
the
sweeping
urgency
of
a
great
climax
nikitin
simply
told
me
that
a
furious
battle
was
raging
some
ten
versts
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
that
we
were
to
go
at
once
to
form
a
temporary
hospital
behind
the
lines
in
the
forest
that
the
nurses
and
the
rest
of
the
otriad
would
remain
in
mittövo
to
wait
for
the
main
tide
of
the
wounded
but
that
we
were
to
go
forward
to
help
the
army
doctors
he
spoke
very
quietly
we
said
nothing
of
marie
ivanovna
i
dressed
quickly
and
on
going
out
found
the
wagons
waiting
some
fifteen
or
twenty
sanitars
and
trenchard
and
andrey
vassilievitch
the
four
of
us
climbed
into
one
of
the
wagons
and
set
off
i
did
not
see
semyonov
trenchard
was
pale
there
were
heavy
black
lines
under
his
eyes
but
he
seemed
calm
and
he
stared
in
front
of
him
as
though
he
were
absorbed
by
some
concentrated
for
the
first
time
in
my
experience
of
him
he
seemed
to
me
a
strong
independent
character
we
did
not
speak
at
all
i
could
see
that
andrey
vassilievitch
was
nervous
his
eyes
were
anxious
and
now
and
then
he
moistened
his
lips
with
his
tongue
when
we
had
crossed
the
river
and
began
to
climb
the
hill
i
knew
that
i
the
forest
it
was
looking
beautiful
under
the
early
morning
sun
its
green
so
delicate
and
clear
its
soft
shadows
so
cool
its
birds
singing
so
carelessly
the
silver
birches
lines
of
light
against
the
dark
spaces
but
this
was
all
to
me
now
as
though
it
had
been
arranged
by
some
ironic
hand
it
knew
well
enough
who
had
died
there
yesterday
and
it
was
preparing
now
behind
its
black
recesses
a
rich
harvest
for
its
malicious
spirit
we
passed
through
the
cholera
village
and
reached
the
white
house
of
yesterday
at
about
ten
as
we
clattered
up
to
the
door
i
for
a
moment
closed
my
eyes
i
felt
as
though
i
could
not
face
the
horrible
place
then
summoning
my
control
i
boldly
challenged
it
surveying
its
long
broken
windows
its
high
doorway
its
sunny
insulting
garden
we
were
met
by
the
stout
doctor
whom
i
had
seen
before
as
he
is
of
some
importance
in
the
events
that
followed
i
will
mention
his
name
konstantine
feôdorovitch
krylov
he
was
large
and
stout
a
true
russian
type
with
a
merry
laughing
face
he
had
the
true
russian
spirit
of
unconquerable
irrational
merriment
he
laughed
at
everything
with
the
gaiety
of
a
man
who
finds
life
too
preposterous
for
words
he
had
all
the
russian
untidyness
kindness
of
heart
gay
ironical
pessimism
was
a
word
unknown
to
him
nothing
was
sacred
to
him
and
yet
at
times
it
seemed
as
though
life
were
so
holy
so
mysterious
that
the
only
way
to
keep
it
from
careless
eyes
was
by
laughing
at
it
he
had
no
principles
no
plans
no
prejudices
no
reverences
if
he
wished
to
sleep
for
a
week
he
would
do
so
if
he
wished
to
eat
for
a
week
he
would
do
so
if
he
died
he
did
not
care
it
was
all
so
absurd
that
it
was
not
worth
while
to
give
it
any
attention
he
would
grow
very
fat
he
would
die
he
would
love
women
play
cards
drink
quarrel
give
his
life
for
a
sentimental
moment
pour
every
farthing
of
his
possessions
into
the
lap
of
a
friend
incur
debts
which
he
would
not
pay
quarrel
wildly
with
a
man
about
a
rouble
remember
things
that
you
would
expect
him
to
forget
forget
everything
that
he
should
remember
a
pagan
a
saint
a
blackguard
a
hero
anything
you
please
so
long
as
you
do
not
take
it
seriously
this
morning
he
was
dirty
and
looked
as
though
he
had
slept
for
many
nights
without
taking
off
his
clothes
unshaven
his
shirt
open
showing
his
hairy
chest
his
eyes
blinking
in
the
light
that
good
he
said
seeing
us
i
got
to
be
off
leaving
the
place
to
you
fearful
time
they
having
over
there
pointing
across
the
garden
yes
five
versts
away
plenty
of
work
in
a
minute
brought
food
with
you
very
little
here
then
i
heard
him
begin
as
he
walked
into
the
house
with
nikitin
terrible
thing
doctor
about
your
sister
yesterday
terrible
i
i
remember
that
my
great
desire
was
that
i
should
not
be
left
alone
with
trenchard
i
clung
to
andrey
vassilievitch
and
a
poor
resource
he
was
watching
with
nervous
eyes
the
building
and
the
glimmering
forest
dusting
his
clothes
and
beginning
sentences
which
he
did
not
finish
trenchard
was
quite
silent

the

because
it
was
afterwards
to
have
importance
though
at
the

i
glanced

i
remember
that
i
speculated
on
the

admired

will

said
find

return

say

no
time
to
lose
vulatch
was
a
little
town
situated
ten
versts
to
our
right
in
the
forest
i
had
heard
of
its
strange
position
before
quite
a
town
and
yet
lying
in
the
very
heart
of
the
forest
as
though
it
had
been
the
settlement
of
some
early
colonists
it
had
running
through
it
a
good
high
road
but
otherwise
was
far
removed
from
the
outer
world
it
had
during
the
war
been
twice
bombarded
and
was
now
i
believed
ruined
and
deserted
for
the
moment
it
was
the
headquarters
of
the
staff
i
was
frankly
frightened
of
going
alone
with
trenchard
frightened
both
of
myself
and
of
him
i
told
him
and
without
a
word
he
went
with
me
when
we
started
off
in
the
wagon
i
looked
at
him
he
was
sitting
on
the
straw
very
quietly
his
hands
folded
looking
in
front
of
him
he
seemed
older
the
sentimental
naiveté
that
had
been
always
in
his
face
seemed
now
entirely
to
have
left
him
he
had
always
looked
before
as
though
he
wanted
some
one
to
help
him
out
of
a
position
that
was
too
difficult
for
him
now
he
was
alone
in
a
world
where
no
one
could
reach
him
during
the
whole
drive
to
vulatch
we
exchanged
no
word
the
sound
of
the
cannon
was
distant
but
incessant
and
strangely
as
it
seemed
to
me
we
were
alone
once
and
again
soldiers
passed
us
sometimes
wagons
with
kitchens
or
provisions
met
us
on
the
road
sometimes
groups
of
men
were
waiting
by
the
roadside
once
we
saw
them
setting
up
telegraph
wires
once
a
desolate
band
of
austrian
prisoners
crossed
our
path
twice
wagons
with
wounded
rumbled
along
but
for
the
most
part
we
were
alone
we
were
out
of
the
main
track
of
the
battle
it
was
as
though
the
forest
had
arranged
this
that
it
might
the
more
impress
us
our
road
although
it
was
the
high
road
was
rough
and
uneven
and
we
advanced
slowly
with
every
step
that
the
horses
took
i
was
the
more
conscious
of
a
sinister
and
malign
influence
i
know
how
easily
one
nerves
can
lend
atmosphere
to
something
that
is
in
itself
innocent
and
harmless
enough
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
at
this
time
in
spite
of
what
had
happened
yesterday
neither
trenchard
nerves
nor
mine
were
strained
my
sensation
must
i
think
have
closely
resembled
the
feelings
of
a
diver
who
for
the
first
time
descends
below
the
water
i
had
never
felt
anything
like
this
before
and
there
was
quite
definitely
about
my
eyes
my
nose
my
mouth
a
feeling
of
suffocation
i
can
only
say
that
it
was
exactly
as
though
i
were
breathing
in
an
atmosphere
that
was
strange
to
me
this
may
have
been
partly
the
effect
of
the
sun
that
was
beating
down
very
strongly
upon
us
but
it
was
also
curiously
enough
the
result
of
some
dimness
that
obscured
the
direct
path
of
one
vision
on
every
side
of
our
rough
forest
road
there
were
black
cavernous
spaces
set
here
and
there
like
caves
between
sheets
of
burning
sunlight
into
these
caves
one
gaze
simply
could
not
penetrate
and
the
light
and
darkness
shifted
about
one
with
exactly
the
effect
of
stirring
swaying
water
although
the
way
was
quite
clear
and
the
road
broad
i
felt
as
though
at
any
moment
our
advance
would
be
stopped
by
an
impenetrable
barrier
a
barrier
of
bristled
thickets
of
an
iron
wall
of
a
sudden
fathomless
precipice
of
course
to
both
trenchard
and
myself
there
were
during
this
drive
thoughts
of
his
dream
we
both
recognized
although
at
this
time
we
did
not
speak
of
it
that
this
was
the
very
place
that
had
now
grown
so
vivid
to
us
ah
this
is
how
it
looks
in
sunlight
i
would
think
to
myself
having
seen
it
always
in
the
early
morning
and
cold
behind
me
the
long
white
house
the
hunters
the
dogs
no
they
were
not
here
in
the
burning
suffocating
sunlight
but
they
would
come
they
would
come
the
monotony
of
the
place
emphasised
its
vastness
it
was
not
i
suppose
a
great
forest
but
it
seemed
as
though
we
were
winding
further
and
further
through
labyrinth
after
labyrinth
of
clouding
obscurity
winding
towards
some
destination
from
which
we
could
never
again
escape
pum
pum
pum
whispered
the
cannon
whirr
whirr
whirr
the
shadowy
trembling
background
echoed
then
with
a
sudden
lifting
of
the
curtain
vulatch
was
revealed
to
us
ruined
towns
and
villages
were
by
this
time
no
new
sight
to
me
but
this
place
was
different
from
anything
that
i
had
ever
seen
before
from
the
bend
of
the
little
hill
we
looked
down
upon
it
and
the
sight
of
it
made
me
shudder
it
was
the
deadest
place
the
place
in
the
world
all
white
under
the
sun
it
lay
there
like
the
bleached
bones
of
some
animal
picked
clean
long
ago
by
the
birds
not
a
sound
came
from
it
not
a
movement
could
be
discerned
in
it
i
could
see
standing
out
straight
from
the
heart
of
it
what
must
have
been
once
a
fine
church
it
had
had
four
green
turrets
perched
like
little
green
bubbles
on
white
towers
three
of
these
were
still
there
and
between
them
stood
the
white
husk
of
the
place
from
where
we
watched
we
could
see
little
fires
of
blue
light
sparkling
like
jewels
between
the
holes
over
it
all
was
a
strange
metallic
glitter
as
though
we
were
seeing
through
glass
glass
shaded
very
faintly
green
under
this
green
shadow
which
seemed
very
gently
to
stain
the
air
the
town
was
indeed
like
a
lost
city
beneath
the
sea
catching
our
breaths
we
plunged
down
into
the
fantastic
depths
as
we
descended
the
hill
we
were
surprised
by
the
silence
not
a
soul
to
be
seen
we
had
expected
to
find
the
place
filled
with
the
soldiers
of
the
division
our
driver
on
this
day
was
the
man
nikolai
whom
i
have
mentioned
before
as
attaching
himself
from
the
very
beginning
to
trenchard
service
he
had
been
unofficial
servant
now
for
a
long
time
saying
very
little
always
succeeding
in
some
quiet
fashion
of
his
own
in
accompanying
trenchard
on
his
expeditions
nikolai
was
one
of
the
quietest
human
beings
i
have
ever
known
his
charming
ugly
face
was
in
repose
a
little
gloomy
not
thoughtful
so
much
as
expectant
dreamy
perhaps
but
also
very
practical
and
unidealistic
his
smile
changed
all
that
in
a
moment
his
face
was
merry
even
malicious
suspicious
and
a
little
ironical
he
had
the
thick
stolid
body
of
the
russian
peasant
who
is
trained
to
any
endurance
any
misfortune
that
god
might
choose
to
send
it
his
attachment
to
trenchard
had
been
so
unobtrusive
that
molozov
had
officially
permitted
it
without
realising
that
he
had
permitted
anything
it
was
so
unobtrusive
that
i
myself
had
not
during
these
last
weeks
noticed
it
i
saw
nikolai
glance
many
times
at
trenchard
his
eyes
were
anxious
and
inquiring
he
looked
at
him
rather
as
a
dog
may
look
at
his
master
although
there
was
here
no
dumb
submission
nor
any
sentimental
weakness
i
should
rather
say
that
nikolai
looked
at
trenchard
as
one
free
man
may
look
at
another
what
is
the
matter
with
you
his
eyes
seemed
to
say
but
i
know
a
terrible
thing
has
happened
to
you
at
any
rate
i
am
here
to
be
of
any
use
that
i
can
nikolai
i
said
why
is
there
no
one
here
mogoo
your
honour
well
the
first
soldier
you
see
you
must
ask
who
said
you
were
to
drive
us
vladimir
stepanovitch
your
honour
are
you
going
to
remain
with
us
his
eyes
rested
for
a
moment
on
trenchard
then
he
turned
to
his
horses
we
were
entering
the
town
now
and
it
did
indeed
present
to
us
a
scene
of
desperate
desolation
the
place
had
been
originally
built
in
rising
tiers
on
the
side
of
the
valley
and
the
principal
street
had
leading
out
of
it
up
the
hill
steps
rising
to
balconied
houses
that
commanded
a
view
of
the
opposite
hill
almost
every
house
in
this
street
was
in
ruins
sometimes
the
ruins
were
complete
only
an
isolated
chimney
of
broken
stone
wall
remaining
sometimes
the
shell
was
standing
the
windows
boarded
up
with
wood
sometimes
almost
the
whole
building
was
there
a
gaping
space
in
the
roof
the
only
sign
of
desolation
and
there
remained
the
ironical
signs
of
its
earlier
life
many
of
the
buildings
had
their
titles
still
upon
them
in
one
place
i
saw
the
blackened
and
almost
illegible
plate
of
a
lawyer
in
another
a
large
still
advertisement
of
a
dentist
here
there
was
the
large
lettering
tobacconist
there
upon
a
trembling
wall
the
tattered
remains
of
an
announcement
of
a
sale
of
furniture
once
most
ironical
of
all
a
gaping
and
building
showed
the
remnant
of
a
cinematograph
picture
a
fat
gentleman
in
a
bowler
hat
entering
with
a
lady
on
either
arm
a
gaily
painted
restaurant
over
this
in
big
letters
the
word
farce
although
we
saw
no
soldiers
we
were
not
entirely
alone
in
and
out
of
the
sunny
caverns
appearing
outlined
against
the
darkness
vanishing
in
a
sudden
blaze
of
light
were
shadows
of
the
citizens
of
vulatch
they
seemed
to
me
without
exception
to
be
jews
from
most
of
the
galician
towns
and
villages
the
jews
had
been
expelled
here
they
only
apparently
had
been
left
of
women
i
saw
scarcely
any
old
men
with
long
dirty
black
or
grizzled
beards
yellow
skins
peaked
black
caps
and
filthy
black
gowns
clutched
about
their
thin
bodies
they
watched
us
silently
ominously
maliciously
they
crept
from
door
to
door
stole
up
the
stone
steps
and
vanished
appeared
as
it
seemed
right
beneath
our
horses
feet
and
disappeared
if
we
caught
them
with
our
eyes
they
bowed
with
a
loathsome
trembling
subservience
there
were
many
little
jewish
children
with
glittering
eyes
naked
feet
bare
scrubby
heads
and
white
faces
nikolai
at
length
caught
an
old
man
and
asked
him
where
the
soldiers
were
the
old
man
replied
in
very
tolerable
russian
that
all
the
soldiers
had
gone
last
night
not
one
of
them
remained
but
he
believed
that
some
more
were
shortly
to
arrive
they
were
always
coming
and
going
he
said
we
stayed
where
we
were
under
the
blazing
sun
and
held
council
in
every
doorway
in
every
shadow
there
were
eyes
watching
us
the
whole
town
was
overweighted
overwhelmed
by
the
brooding
forest
from
where
we
stood
i
could
see
it
rising
on
every
side
of
us
like
a
trembling
threatening
green
wave
in
the
furious
heat
of
the
sun
the
white
ruins
seemed
to
jump
and
leap
well
i
said
to
trenchard
what
to
be
done
he
pulled
himself
back
from
his
thoughts
he
had
been
sitting
in
the
cart
quite
motionless
his
face
white
and
hidden
as
though
he
slept
he
raised
his
tired
heavy
eyes
to
my
face
do
he
said
yes
i
answered
impatiently
did
you
hear
what
nikolai
said
there
are
no
soldiers
here
we
ca
find
maximoff
because
he
here
we
must
go
back
i
suppose
very
well
he
answered
indifferently
i
not
going
back
i
said
until
i
had
something
to
drink
tea
or
coffee
i
wonder
whether
there
anything
here
any
place
we
could
go
to
nikolai
inquired
old
shylock
pointed
with
his
bony
finger
down
the
street
very
fine
restaurant
there
he
said
will
you
come
and
see
i
asked
trenchard
very
well
said
trenchard
i
told
nikolai
to
stay
there
and
wait
for
us
i
walked
down
the
street
followed
by
trenchard
i
found
on
my
left
at
the
top
of
a
little
flight
of
steps
a
house
that
was
for
the
most
part
untouched
by
the
general
havoc
around
and
about
it
the
lower
windows
were
cracked
and
the
door
open
and
gaping
but
there
stood
quite
bravely
with
new
paint
the
word
on
the
lintel
and
there
were
even
curtains
about
the
upper
windows
passing
through
the
door
we
found
a
room
decently
clean
and
behind
the
little
bar
a
stout
galician
in
white
shirt
and
grey
trousers
a
citizen
of
the
normal
world
we
were
just
then
his
only
customers
we
asked
him
for
tea
and
sat
down
at
a
little
table
in
the
corner
of
the
room
he
did
not
talk
to
us
but
stood
in
his
place
humming
cheerfully
to
himself
and
cleaning
glasses
he
was
a
rogue
i
thought
looking
at
his
little
eyes
but
at
any
rate
a
merry
rogue
he
certainly
had
kept
off
from
him
the
general
death
and
desolation
that
had
overwhelmed
his
neighbours
i
sat
opposite
to
trenchard
and
wondered
what
to
say
to
him
his
expression
had
never
varied
as
i
looked
at
him
i
could
not
but
think
of
the
strength
of
his
eyes
of
his
mouth
the
quiet
concentration
of
his
hands
a
different
figure
from
the
smiling
uncertain
man
on
the
petrograd
station
how
many
years
ago
our
tea
was
brought
to
us
then
quite
suddenly
trenchard
said
to
me
did
she
say
anything
before
she
died
no
i
answered
quietly
she
died
instantly
they
told
me
how
exactly
was
she
killed
his
eyes
watched
my
face
without
falter
clearly
gravely
steadfastly
she
was
killed
by
a
bullet
stepped
out
from
behind
her
shelter
and
it
happened
at
once
she
can
have
suffered
nothing
and
semyonov
her
he
could
not
have
prevented
it
it
might
have
happened
to
any
one
i
would
have
prevented
it
he
said
nodding
his
head
gravely
he
was
silent
for
a
little
then
with
a
sudden
jerk
he
said
where
has
she
gone
gone
i
repeated
stupidly
after
him
yes
that
not
death
to
go
like
that
she
must
be
somewhere
still
somewhere
in
this
beastly
forest
what
afterwards
when
you
saw
her
what
her
face
she
looked
very
peaceful
quite
happy
no
restlessness
in
her
face
no
anxiety
none
but
all
that
life
that
energy
it
ca
have
stopped
quite
suddenly
it
she
ca
have
wanted
to
know
all
those
things
that
she
was
so
eager
about
before
he
was
suddenly
voluble
excited
leaning
forward
staring
at
me
you
know
how
she
was
you
must
have
seen
it
numbers
of
times
how
she
never
looked
at
any
of
us
really
how
we
were
none
of
us
no
not
even
semyonov
anything
to
her
always
staring
past
us
wanting
to
know
the
answer
to
questions
that
could
solve
for
her
she
would
give
it
all
up
simply
for
nothing
simply
for
a
bullet
he
broke
off
look
here
trenchard
i
said
try
not
to
think
of
her
just
now
more
than
you
can
help
we
in
for
a
stiff
time
i
believe
this
will
be
our
last
easy
afternoon
i
fancy
and
even
now
we
ought
to
be
back
helping
nikitin
you
got
to
work
all
you
know
nerves
get
wrong
easily
enough
in
a
place
like
this
and
after
what
has
happened
i
feel
this
damned
forest
already
but
we
must
our
nerves
go
we
simply
got
to
work
and
think
about
nothing
at
all
about
nothing
at
i
do
believe
that
he
heard
me
semyonov
he
said
slowly
what
did
he
do
he
was
very
quiet
i
answered
he
did
say
anything
he
looked
awful
yes
she
snapped
her
fingers
at
anyway
could
keep
her
for
all
his
bullying
it
pretty
well
killed
him
i
said
rather
fiercely
look
here
trenchard
do
think
of
yourself
or
of
her
every
one
in
it
now
there
is
any
personality
about
it
we
simply
got
to
do
our
best
and
not
think
about
it
it
thinking
that
beats
one
if
one
lets
it
semyonov
semyonov
he
repeated
to
himself
smiling
no
had
not
power
over
her
then
looking
at
me
very
calmly
he
remarked
this
death
you
know
durward
it
simply
does
exist
it
stop
it
ca
stop
if
they
determined
i
find
her
before
semyonov
does
too
then
as
though
he
had
waked
from
sleep
he
said
to
me
his
voice
trembling
a
little
am
i
talking
queerly
durward
if
i
am
think
anything
of
it
it
this
heat
and
this
place
let
get
back
he
only
spoke
once
more
he
said
do
you
remember
that
first
drive
ages
ago
when
we
saw
the
trenches
and
heard
the
frogs
and
i
thought
there
was
some
one
there
yes
i
said
i
remember
well
it
rather
like
that
now
is
it
a
pretty
girl
or
years
of
age
obviously
the
daughter
of
the
proprietor
came
up
to
us
and
asked
us
if
we
would
like
any
more
tea
she
would
be
stout
later
on
her
red
cheeks
were
plump
and
her
black
hair
arranged
coquettishly
in
little
shining
curls
she
smiled
on
us
no
more
tea
she
said
no
more
i
answered
you
will
not
be
staying
here
not
we
have
a
nice
room
here
no
thank
you
perhaps
one
of
you
no
we
are
returning
perhaps
for
an
hour
or
two
then
smiling
at
me
and
laughing
a
little
i
have
known
many
officers
very
many
no
thank
you
i
said
sternly
i
have
a
sister
she
said
she
turned
crying
marie
marie
a
little
girl
who
could
not
have
been
more
than
fourteen
years
of
age
appeared
from
the
background
she
also
was
and
plump
her
hair
also
was
arranged
in
black
shining
curls
she
stood
looking
at
us
half
smiling
half
defiant
sucking
her
finger
she
also
has
known
officers
said
the
girl
she
would
be
very
glad
if
you
cared
i
heard
their
father
behind
the
bar
humming
to
himself
come
out
of
this
i
said
to
trenchard
come
away
he
followed
me
quietly
bowing
very
politely
to
the
staring
sisters
go
on
i
said
to
nikolai
drive
on
no
time
to
waste
we
got
work
to
do
on
our
return
we
found
that
the
press
of
work
was
not
as
yet
severe
half
the
building
belonged
to
us
the
remaining
half
being
used
by
the
officers
of
the
battery
nikitin
had
arranged
a
large
room
that
must
i
think
have
been
a
in
happier
days
with
beds
to
the
right
was
the
overhead
were
our
bedrooms
and
the
room
where
originally
i
had
sat
with
marie
ivanovna
was
a
general
meeting
place
the
officers
of
the
battery
two
and
two
very
young
indeed
were
extremely
courteous
and
begged
us
to
make
use
of
them
in
any
way
possible
they
were
living
in
the
raggedest
fashion
a
growth
of
beard
on
their
chins
their
beds
unmade
the
floor
littered
with
ends
of
cigarettes
pieces
of
paper
journals
been
here
weeks
they
apologetically
explained
to
us
come
in
and
have
a
meal
with
us
whenever
you
like
they
resembled
animals
in
a
cave
when
they
were
not
on
duty
they
played
and
slept
meanwhile
for
three
days
and
nights
our
work
was
slight
the
battle
drew
further
away
into
the
forest
wagons
with
wounded
came
to
us
only
at
long
intervals
the
result
of
these
three
days
was
a
strange
new
intimacy
between
the
four
of
us
i
have
never
in
all
my
life
seen
anything
more
charming
than
the
behaviour
of
nikitin
and
andrey
vassilievitch
to
trenchard
there
is
something
about
russian
kindness
that
is
both
simpler
and
more
tactful
than
any
other
kindness
in
the
world
tact
is
too
often
another
name
for
insincerity
but
russian
kindheartedness
is
the
most
honest
impulse
in
the
russian
soul
the
quality
that
comes
first
before
anger
before
injustice
before
prejudice
before
slander
before
disloyalty
and
overrides
them
all
they
were
of
course
conscious
that
trenchard
case
was
worse
than
their
own
marie
ivanovna
death
had
shocked
them
but
she
had
been
outside
their
lives
and
already
she
was
fading
from
them
trenchard
was
another
matter
nikitin
seemed
to
me
for
the
first
time
in
my
knowledge
of
him
to
come
down
from
his
idealistic
dreaming
he
cared
for
trenchard
like
a
child
but
never
obtrusively
trenchard
seemed
to
appreciate
it
but
there
was
something
about
him
that
i
did
not
like
his
nerves
were
tensely
strained
he
did
his
work
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
some
impossible
distance
he
often
did
not
hear
us
when
we
spoke
to
him
and
so
the
three
of
us
formed
a
kind
of
hedge
about
him
to
protect
him
a
hedge
of
which
he
was
perfectly
unconscious
he
was
very
silent
and
i
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
hear
again
one
of
those
glebeshire
stories
that
i
had
once
found
so
tiresome
that
some
plan
or
purpose
was
in
his
head
one
could
not
doubt
we
had
all
of
us
much
in
common
in
our
characters
we
liked
the
sentimental
easy
coloured
view
of
life
we
suddenly
felt
a
strange
freedom
here
in
this
place
for
myself
on
the
third
day
i
found
that
marie
ivanovna
was
most
strangely
present
with
me
and
on
the
afternoon
of
that
day
our
wounded
quiet
on
their
beds
our
wagons
sent
into
the
tent
with
no
prospect
of
their
return
for
several
hours
we
sat
together
nikitin
andrey
vassilievitch
and
i
looking
out
through
a
break
in
the
garden
towards
the
forest
and
talked
about
her
the
weather
was
now
very
heavy
certainly
a
thunderstorm
was
coming
i
was
also
weighted
down
by
an
intense
desire
for
sleep
at
the
same
time
knowing
that
if
i
were
to
fling
myself
on
my
bed
sleep
would
not
come
to
me
this
is
an
experience
that
is
not
unusual
at
the
front
and
officers
have
told
me
that
in
the
middle
of
a
battle
when
there
comes
a
sudden
lull
their
longing
for
sleep
has
been
so
overpowering
that
no
imminent
danger
could
lift
it
from
their
eyes
we
sat
there
then
and
talked
in
low
voices
of
marie
ivanovna
i
was
aware
of
the
buzzing
of
the
flies
of
the
dull
yellow
light
beyond
the
windows
of
the
forest
crouching
a
little
as
it
seemed
to
me
like
a
creature
who
expects
a
blow
we
were
all
half
asleep
perhaps
the
room
dark
behind
us
and
we
talked
of
her
as
we
might
talk
of
a
picture
a
book
an
experience
ended
and
dismissed
something
outside
our
present
affairs
and
yet
i
knew
that
for
me
at
any
rate
she
was
not
outside
them
i
felt
as
though
at
any
moment
she
might
enter
the
room
we
discussed
her
aloofness
her
sudden
happiness
and
her
sudden
distress
her
intimacies
and
withdrawals
nikitin
and
andrey
vassilievitch
slowly
elaborating
her
into
a
high
romantic
figure
behind
her
behind
all
our
thoughts
of
her
there
was
the
presence
of
semyonov
nothing
was
stranger
during
our
time
here
than
the
way
that
semyonov
had
always
kept
us
company
our
consciousness
of
relief
from
him
had
begun
it
we
had
been
more
under
his
influence
than
any
of
us
had
cared
to
confess
and
in
his
presence
had
checked
our
natural
impulses
i
also
was
strongly
aware
of
him
through
trenchard
trenchard
seemed
now
to
have
a
horror
of
him
that
could
be
explained
only
by
the
fact
that
he
held
him
responsible
for
marie
ivanovna
death
it
a
good
thing
i
thought
to
myself
that
semyonov
not
here
these
hours
of
waiting
when
there
was
nothing
to
do
was
bad
for
all
our
nerves
upon
this
afternoon
i
remember
that
after
a
time
silence
fell
between
us
we
were
all
staring
in
front
of
us
seeing
pictures
of
other
places
and
other
people
i
was
aware
as
i
always
was
of
the
forest
seeing
it
shine
with
its
sinister
green
haze
seeing
the
white
bleached
town
the
huddled
villagers
waiting
for
their
food
but
seeing
yet
more
vividly
the
deep
silences
the
dark
hollows
the
silent
avenues
of
silver
birch
against
this
were
the
figures
of
the
people
who
were
dear
to
me
it
is
strange
how
war
selects
and
brings
forward
as
one
eternal
company
the
one
or
two
souls
who
have
been
of
importance
in
one
life
one
knows
then
in
those
long
long
threatening
pauses
when
the
battle
seems
to
gather
itself
together
before
it
thunders
its
next
smashing
blow
those
who
are
one
true
companions
certain
english
figures
were
now
with
me
outlined
against
the
forest
and
joined
together
with
them
marie
ivanovna
as
i
had
last
seen
her
turning
round
to
me
by
the
door
and
smiling
upon
me
i
did
truthfully
feel
as
trenchard
had
said
to
me
that
she
was
not
dead
i
sat
staring
before
me
conjuring
her
to
appear
the
others
also
sat
there
staring
in
front
of
them
were
they
also
summoning
some
figure
i
knew
as
though
andrey
vassilievitch
had
told
me
that
he
was
thinking
of
his
wife
and
nikitin
he
sat
there
lying
back
on
the
old
sofa
that
marie
had
used
his
black
beard
his
long
limbs
his
dark
eyes
giving
him
the
colour
of
some
eastern
magician
he
did
indeed
with
his
intense
absorbed
gaze
seem
to
be
casting
a
spell
as
i
looked
andrey
vassilievitch
caught
his
glance
they
exchanged
the
strangest
flash
something
that
was
intimate
and
yet
foreign
something
appealing
and
yet
hostile
it
was
as
though
andrey
vassilievitch
had
said
i
know
you
are
thinking
of
her
leave
her
to
me
and
nikitin
had
replied
my
poor
friend
what
can
you
do
i
do
as
i
please
i
know
at
least
that
i
saw
andrey
vassilievitch
frown
make
as
though
he
would
get
up
and
leave
the
room
then
think
better
of
it
and
sink
back
into
his
chair
i
remember
that
just
at
that
moment
trenchard
entered
he
joined
us
and
sat
on
the
sofa
near
nikitin
without
speaking
staring
in
front
of
him
like
the
rest
of
us
his
face
was
tired
and
old
his
cheeks
hollow
i
waited
and
the
silence
began
to
get
on
my
nerves
then
there
came
an
interruption
the
door
opened
quite
silently
we
all
turned
our
eyes
towards
it
without
moving
our
heads
in
the
doorway
stood
semyonov
we
were
startled
as
though
by
a
ghost
i
remember
that
andrey
vassilievitch
jumped
to
his
feet
crying
trenchard
never
moved
semyonov
with
his
usual
stolid
came
towards
us
greeted
us
then
turning
to
me
said
i
come
to
take
your
place
ivan
andreievitch
my
place
i
stammered
yes
you
wanted
there
you
to
return
at
once
in
the
in
half
an
hour
if
you
do
mind
and
you
stay
and
i
stay
no
one
else
said
anything
i
remember
that
i
had
some
of
protesting
of
begging
to
be
allowed
to
remain
but
i
was
no
match
for
semyonov
i
could
fancy
the
futility
of
my
saying
but
really
alexei
petrovitch
we
do
want
you
here
it
much
better
to
leave
me
you
upset
them
all
it
a
nervous
place
this
i
said
nothing
except
all
right
i
go
he
watched
me
he
watched
us
all
i
fancy
that
he
smiled
outside
i
had
a
desperate
absurd
thought
that
i
would
return
and
ask
him
to
be
kind
to
trenchard
as
i
turned
away
some
one
seemed
to
whisper
in
my
ear
he
come
you
know
to
find
marie
ivanovna
chapter
iv
four
before
i
give
the
extracts
from
trenchard
diary
that
follow
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
do
not
believe
that
trenchard
had
any
thought
whatever
as
he
wrote
of
publication
he
says
quite
clearly
that
he
wrote
simply
for
his
own
satisfaction
and
later
interest
at
the
same
time
i
am
convinced
that
he
would
not
now
object
to
their
publication
if
he
had
been
here
he
would
i
know
have
supported
my
intention
the
diary
lies
before
me
here
on
my
table
written
in
two
yellow
manuscript
books
without
lines
they
are
written
very
unevenly
and
untidily
with
very
few
erasures
but
at
times
incoherently
and
with
gaps
in
one
place
he
has
cut
from
the
newspaper
rupert
brooke
sonnet
beginning
out
you
bugles
over
the
rich
dead
and
pasted
it
on
to
the
blank
page
at
times
he
sticks
on
to
the
other
pages
newspaper
descriptions
that
have
pleased
him
his
own
descriptions
of
the
forest
seem
to
me
influenced
by
my
talks
with
him
and
i
remember
that
it
was
nikitin
who
spoke
of
the
light
like
a
glass
ball
and
of
the
water
for
the
most
part
he
exhibits
from
the
beginning
of
the
diary
to
the
end
extreme
practical
common
sense
and
he
makes
i
fancy
a
very
strong
effort
to
record
quite
simply
and
even
naïvely
the
truth
as
he
sees
it
at
other
times
he
is
quite
frankly
incoherent
i
will
give
on
another
page
my
impression
of
him
when
i
saw
him
on
my
return
to
the
forest
i
am
of
course
in
no
way
responsible
for
inconsistencies
or
irrelevances
he
had
kept
a
diary
since
his
first
coming
to
the
war
and
i
have
already
given
some
extracts
from
it
the
earlier
diary
in
one
place
only
namely
his
account
of
his
adventure
during
his
night
with
nikitin
is
of
the
full
descriptive
order
that
one
occasion
i
have
already
quoted
in
its
entirety
with
that
exception
the
early
diary
is
brief
and
concerned
only
with
the
dryest
recital
of
events
after
the
death
of
marie
ivanovna
however
its
character
entirely
changes
for
reasons
which
he
himself
shows
i
would
have
expected
perhaps
a
certain
solemnity
or
even
pomposity
in
the
style
of
it
he
had
never
a
strong
sense
of
humour
but
i
find
it
written
in
the
very
simplest
fashion
words
here
and
there
are
misspelt
and
his
handwriting
is
large
and
round
like
a
schoolboy
july
i
intend
to
write
this
diary
with
great
fulness
for
two
reasons
in
the
first
place
because
i
can
see
that
it
is
of
the
greatest
importance
if
one
is
to
get
through
this
business
properly
to
leave
no
hours
empty
the
trying
thing
in
this
affair
is
having
nothing
to
do
nothing
one
can
do
they
all
officers
soldiers
from
nikolai
nikolaievitch
to
my
nikolai
here
will
tell
you
that
no
empty
hours
for
me
if
i
can
help
it
secondly
i
really
do
wish
to
record
exactly
my
experiences
here
i
am
perfectly
aware
that
when
i
out
of
it
all
when
it
even
a
march
behind
me
i
shall
regard
it
as
frankly
incredible
not
the
thing
itself
but
the
way
i
felt
about
it
when
i
come
out
of
it
into
the
world
again
i
shall
be
overwhelmed
with
other
people
impressions
of
it
people
far
cleverer
than
i
there
will
be
brilliant
descriptions
of
battles
of
what
it
feels
like
to
be
under
fire
of
marches
victories
retreats
wounds
death
everything
i
shall
forget
what
my
own
little
tiny
piece
of
it
was
like
and
i
do
want
to
forget
i
want
intensely
to
remember
the
truth
because
the
truth
is
bound
up
with
marie
and
marie
with
the
truth
why
need
i
be
shy
now
about
her
why
should
i
hesitate
under
the
fear
of
my
own
later
timidity
of
saying
exactly
now
what
i
feel
god
knows
what
i
feel
i
am
confused
i
believe
with
moments
of
fiery
biting
realisation
i
neither
sad
nor
happy
only
breathlessly
expectant
the
only
adventure
i
have
ever
had
in
my
life
is
not
no
it
is
not
yet
ended
and
i
know
that
marie
could
not
have
left
me
like
that
without
a
word
unless
she
were
returning
or
were
going
to
send
for
me
meanwhile
a
beastly
thing
has
happened
a
thing
that
will
make
life
much
harder
for
me
here
all
the
morning
there
was
work
bandaged
twenty
had
fifty
in
altogether
sent
on
kept
the
rest
two
died
during
the
morning
this
is
really
a
good
place
to
be
it
so
hemmed
in
with
trees
we
ought
to
be
somewhere
more
open
the
forest
is
unhealthy
too
there
been
fighting
in
and
out
of
it
almost
since
the
war
began
it
be
healthy
in
this
hot
weather
the
place
then
there
are
the
flies
i
write
them
with
a
capital
letter
because
i
got
to
keep
my
head
about
the
flies
does
any
one
at
home
or
away
from
this
infernal
strip
of
fighting
realise
what
flies
are
of
course
one
read
of
the
tropical
sorts
all
red
and
stinging
or
white
and
bloated
what
you
like
evil
and
horrid
but
these
here
are
just
the
ordinary
household
kind
quite
ordinary
but
sheets
walls
of
them
i
came
into
the
little
larder
place
near
our
this
morning
i
thought
they
painted
the
walls
black
during
the
night
then
at
my
taking
the
cover
off
some
sugar
it
was
exactly
as
though
the
walls
hovered
and
then
fell
inward
breaking
into
black
dust
as
they
fell
they
cluster
over
a
drop
of
wine
on
the
table
just
like
an
evil
black
flower
with
grey
petals
with
one
body
they
can
play
tricks
beyond
belief
they
at
one
hovering
at
a
distance
waiting
they
watch
one
with
their
wicked
little
eyes
yes
i
shall
have
to
be
careful
about
flies
i
had
a
headache
all
day
but
then
in
the
afternoon
there
was
a
thunderstorm
hovering
somewhere
near
and
there
was
no
work
to
do
i
feel
tired
too
and
yet
i
ca
sleep
later
in
the
afternoon
we
were
all
sitting
together
very
quiet
not
talking
i
was
thinking
about
semyonov
then
i
wondered
whether
he
felt
her
death
how
had
he
taken
it
durward
would
tell
me
so
little
i
was
so
glad
all
the
same
that
he
was
here
and
yet
in
the
strangest
way
i
would
like
to
have
spoken
to
him
to
have
asked
him
if
i
had
dared
a
little
about
her
he
was
the
only
man
to
whom
she
really
gave
herself
i
do
grudge
him
that
but
there
so
much
that
i
want
to
know
and
yet
i
die
rather
than
ask
him
die
that
an
old
phrase
now
death
would
tell
me
much
more
than
semyonov
ever
could
just
when
we
were
sitting
there
he
came
in
it
was
the
most
horrible
shock
i
do
want
to
put
it
melodramatically
but
that
was
exactly
what
it
was
i
had
been
thinking
of
him
thinking
even
of
speaking
to
him
but
i
had
known
at
the
time
that
he
was
here
that
he
could
be
here
then
there
he
was
in
the
doorway
square
and
solid
and
grave
and
scornful
now
the
horrible
thing
is
that
the
moment
i
realised
him
i
felt
afraid
i
did
feel
anger
or
hatred
or
fine
desires
for
revenge
anything
like
that
simply
a
miserable
contemptible
fear
it
seems
that
as
soon
as
i
climb
out
of
one
fear
i
tumble
into
another
they
are
not
physical
now
but
the
last
bit
seems
rather
silly
but
i
leave
it
as
to
semyonov
of
course
he
was
very
quiet
and
scornful
with
all
of
us
he
told
durward
that
he
come
to
take
his
place
and
durward
went
without
a
word
semyonov
went
off
then
with
nikitin
looking
about
and
making
suggestions
he
changed
some
things
but
not
very
much
we
had
been
pretty
intimate
all
of
us
before
he
came
i
had
really
felt
this
last
day
that
vladimir
stepanovitch
and
andrey
vassilievitch
were
understood
by
me
russians
come
and
go
so
at
one
moment
they
are
close
to
you
intimate
then
suddenly
they
shut
up
are
miles
away
look
at
you
with
distrust
and
suspicion
so
with
these
two
on
semyonov
arrival
they
changed
absolutely
shut
them
up
of
course
we
were
all
as
gloomy
at
supper
as
though
we
were
deadly
enemies
but
the
worst
thing
was
at
night
durward
and
i
had
slept
in
one
little
room
vladimir
stepanovitch
and
andrey
vassilievitch
in
another
of
course
semyonov
took
durward
bed
there
was
nowhere
else
for
him
to
go
i
do
know
what
he
thought
about
it
of
course
he
said
nothing
he
talked
a
little
about
ordinary
things
and
i
answered
stupidly
as
i
always
do
with
him
i
hated
the
solemn
way
he
undressed
he
was
a
long
time
cleaning
his
teeth
making
noises
in
his
mouth
as
though
he
were
laughing
at
me
then
he
sat
on
his
bed
naked
except
for
his
shirt
combing
his
moustache
and
beard
very
carefully
with
a
he
was
so
thick
and
solid
and
scornful
not
looking
at
me
exactly
just
staring
in
front
of
him
there
was
no
sound
except
his
comb
scraping
through
his
beard
the
room
was
so
small
and
he
seemed
absolutely
to
fill
it
so
that
i
felt
really
against
the
wall
it
was
as
though
he
were
showing
me
deliberately
how
much
finer
a
man
he
was
than
i
how
much
stronger
his
body
that
he
could
do
with
me
if
he
liked
he
asked
me
very
politely
whether
i
mind
blowing
out
the
candle
and
i
did
it
at
once
he
watched
me
as
i
walked
across
the
floor
and
i
felt
ashamed
of
my
thinness
and
my
ugliness
and
know
that
he
knew
that
i
was
after
the
light
was
blown
out
i
heard
him
settle
into
his
bed
with
a
great
heavy
plop
i
could
sleep
for
a
long
time
and
at
every
movement
that
he
made
i
felt
as
though
he
were
laughing
at
me
and
yet
with
all
this
i
had
also
the
strangest
impulse
to
get
up
there
in
the
dark
to
walk
across
the
room
to
put
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
to
ask
him
about
her
what
would
he
do
he
refuse
to
speak
i
suppose
i
should
only
get
insulted
and
yet
he
must
be
thinking
of
her
all
the
time
just
as
i
am
he
must
to
talk
of
her
and
i
know
her
better
than
any
one
else
did
and
perhaps
if
i
once
broke
down
his
pride
and
yet
every
time
that
his
body
moved
and
the
bed
creaked
i
felt
that
i
hated
him
that
i
never
wanted
to
speak
to
him
again
that
oh
but
i
ashamed
of
myself
he
is
right
to
despise
me
july
it
is
just
midnight
i
am
on
duty
everything
is
quiet
and
there
are
not
likely
i
think
to
be
any
more
wounded
until
the
morning
i
am
sitting
in
the
room
where
they
brought
marie
it
strange
to
think
of
that
and
when
you
sitting
with
a
candle
in
a
dark
room
you
can
imagine
anything
it
odd
in
this
affair
how
little
things
affect
one
there
a
book
here
a
report
on
new
mexico
i
looked
at
it
idly
the
other
day
and
now
i
for
ever
picking
it
up
it
always
opens
at
the
same
page
and
i
find
myself
thinking
speculating
about
it
in
a
ridiculous
manner
i
shall
throw
the
thing
away
but
i
know
the
page
by
heart
anyway
an
account
of
the
work
of
some
school
or
other
here
are
a
few
of
the
lectures
that
were
given
fred
bush
what
the
community
owes
the
newspaper
and
what
the
newspaper
owes
the
rev
glass
hon
cessna
do
pay
too
dearly
for
the
prof
wellington
putman
rip
van
rev
hanshaw
the
mind
picture
gallery
then
they
acted
the
normal
students
whoever
they
may
be
othello
dunlavey
iago
douglas
giffard
desdemona
carrie
whitehill
emilia
gussie
rodgers
afterwards
i
see
that
miss
gussie
rodgers
gave
a
lecture
on
the
in
literature
she
must
have
been
a
clever
young
woman
then
i
see
that
they
decorated
one
of
their
rooms
with
a
large
number
of
carbon
prints
of
celebrated
paintings
the
class
picture
being
the
most
important
and
costing
in
the
neighbourhood
of
this
is
the
hunting
scene
of
ruysdael
also
they
added
to
their
museum
manufactured
articles
from
abroad
illustrative
of
the
habits
and
customs
of
foreigners
now
is
that
incredible
after
the
day
that
i
had
where
do
the
things
join
what
all
got
to
do
with
the
horrors
been
through
with
the
forest
the
cholera
marie
semyonov
with
that
happening
in
europe
with
this
mad
earthquake
of
a
catastrophe
and
yet
one
thinks
of
such
silly
things
i
can
see
them
doing
with
their
cheap
ermine
bad
jewellery
and
impossible
wigs
i
expect
othello
black
came
off
as
he
got
hotter
and
hotter
and
the
rev
glass
on
fools
there
be
all
the
cheap
morality
it
better
my
young
friends
to
be
good
than
to
be
bad
it
pays
better
in
the
end
and
there
be
little
stories
sentimental
some
of
them
and
humorous
some
of
them
there
be
a
general
titter
of
laughter
at
the
humorous
ones
and
the
carbon
prints
the
ruysdael
always
pointed
out
to
visitors
and
after
the
war
it
will
all
be
going
on
again
at
polchester
too
they
be
having
cheap
lectures
in
the
and
shakespeare
readings
and
the
connexion
between
that
and
this
the
permanent
thing
in
us
that
goes
on
whatever
life
may
do
to
us
is
life
still
beautiful
and
noble
in
spite
of
whatever
man
may
do
with
it
or
is
semyonov
right
and
there
is
no
meaning
in
my
love
for
marie
nothing
real
and
true
except
the
things
we
see
with
our
eyes
hear
with
our
ears
is
semyonov
right
or
are
nikitin
andrey
vassilievitch
and
i
and
now
let
me
stick
to
facts
i
left
this
morning
about
six
with
twenty
wagons
to
fetch
wounded
a
wonderful
summer
morning
the
forest
quite
incredibly
beautiful
birds
singing
in
thousands
and
that
strange
little
stream
that
runs
near
our
house
and
can
look
so
abominable
when
it
pleases
was
trembling
and
lovely
as
though
it
did
know
what
evil
was
we
got
to
the
first
red
cross
place
about
eight
here
was
krylov
what
a
good
fellow
always
cheerful
always
kindhearted
nothing
can
dismay
him
a
russian
type
that
common
enough
in
spite
of
all
the
profound
pessimism
of
the
russian
heart
that
we
always
hearing
of
there
he
was
anyway
working
like
a
butcher
before
a
dirty
looking
barn
they
were
working
in
and
it
smelt
like
hell
cannon
pretty
close
too
they
say
the
austrians
are
fearfully
strong
just
here
and
of
course
our
ammunition
is
climbing
down
to
less
than
nothing
looks
as
though
we
were
going
to
have
a
hot
time
soon
i
turned
in
and
helped
krylov
all
the
morning
and
somehow
his
fat
ugly
face
his
little
exclamations
his
explosive
comical
rages
his
sudden
rough
kindnesses
did
one
a
world
of
good
we
filled
the
wagons
and
sent
them
back
then
about
midday
under
a
blazing
hot
sun
we
went
on
with
the
others
is
there
any
place
in
the
globe
hot
and
suffocating
quite
as
this
forest
is
even
in
the
open
spaces
one
ca
breathe
and
there
never
any
proper
shade
under
the
trees
at
first
we
were
at
a
loss
no
one
seemed
quite
to
know
where
the
vengrovsky
polk
were
i
had
to
go
on
alone
and
reconnoitre
i
was
right
out
in
the
open
then
and
more
alone
than
one
could
believe
cannon
were
blazing
away
and
one
battery
seemed
just
behind
me
and
yet
i
could
see
it
i
could
see
nothing
only
great
ridges
of
hills
with
the
forest
like
gigantic
torrents
of
green
water
under
the
mist
and
just
at
my
feet
cornfields
with
cornflowers
then
i
saw
rather
a
wonderful
thing
i
came
to
the
edge
of
my
hill
and
looked
down
into
a
cup
of
a
valley
quite
a
little
valley
with
the
green
waves
towering
on
every
side
of
it
through
the
mist
there
shimmered
below
me
a
blue
lake
i
was
puzzled
there
was
no
water
here
that
i
knew
but
by
this
time
the
forest
has
so
bewitched
my
senses
that
i
ready
to
believe
anything
of
it
there
it
was
anyway
a
blue
lake
shifting
a
little
under
gold
haze
i
climbed
down
the
hill
a
yard
or
two
and
then
you
can
believe
that
i
jumped
my
blue
lake
was
austrian
prisoners
nothing
more
nor
less
has
any
one
quite
seen
them
like
that
before
i
wonder
and
is
this
forest
really
the
old
witch
forest
able
to
do
what
it
pleases
with
anything
there
they
were
hundreds
of
them
covering
the
whole
floor
of
the
little
valley
i
walked
down
into
the
middle
of
them
found
an
officer
asked
him
about
wounded
and
got
directed
some
two
versts
in
front
of
me
then
i
climbed
up
the
hill
back
to
my
wagons
and
we
started
off
we
went
down
the
hill
round
by
the
road
and
came
to
the
prisoners
crossed
a
stream
and
plunged
into
a
shining
dazzling
nightmare
the
cannon
were
i
do
know
all
a
considerable
distance
away
i
suppose
because
the
only
sign
of
shell
were
the
little
breaking
puffs
of
smoke
in
the
blue
sky
with
just
a
of
light
as
they
broke
but
really
amongst
that
welter
of
wooded
hill
the
sounds
were
uncanny
they
be
under
one
feet
over
one
head
in
one
ear
up
against
one
stomach
straight
in
the
small
of
back
since
my
night
with
nikitin
physical
fear
really
seems
to
have
left
me
the
whole
outward
paraphernalia
of
the
war
has
become
an
entirely
commonplace
thing
but
it
was
the
forest
that
i
felt
exactly
as
though
it
were
playing
with
me
was
there
an
old
mediæval
torture
when
they
shot
arrows
at
their
victim
always
just
missing
him
first
on
one
side
then
on
another
until
at
last
tired
of
the
game
they
fixed
him
through
the
head
well
that
what
the
old
beast
was
trying
to
do
to
me
to
doubt
what
real
and
what
is
not
to
make
me
question
my
senses
we
tumbled
quite
suddenly
on
to
some
men
a
small
red
cross
shelter
and
two
or
three
hundred
soldiers
sitting
under
the
trees
by
the
road
resting
most
of
them
sleeping
the
doctor
in
the
red
cross
place
a
small
fussy
man
was
and
overworked
there
were
at
least
thirty
dead
men
lying
in
a
row
outside
the
shelter
and
the
army
sanitars
were
bringing
in
more
wounded
every
minute
why
were
there
more
wagons
what
was
the
use
of
coming
with
so
few
where
was
the
other
doctor
some
one
or
other
who
ought
to
have
relieved
him
there
he
was
like
a
little
monkey
on
wires
dancing
up
and
down
in
the
blazing
road
his
arms
covered
with
blood
pincers
in
one
hand
and
bandages
in
the
other
and
the
inside
of
his
shelter
with
such
a
green
filthy
smell
coming
out
of
it
that
you
think
the
roof
would
burst
i
filled
seven
of
my
wagons
sent
them
back
and
went
forward
with
the
remaining
three
we
were
climbing
now
up
through
the
forest
road
the
shell
very
close
making
a
terrific
noise
and
in
between
the
scream
of
the
shell
the
birds
singing
like
anything
the
road
turned
the
corner
and
then
we
in
the
middle
of
it
now
the
worst
thing
i
seen
with
my
eyes
since
i
came
to
the
war
worst
thing
i
shall
ever
see
perhaps
one
looks
back
you
know
to
one
of
those
old
average
afternoons
at
polchester
my
father
coming
back
from
golf
i
myself
going
into
the
old
garden
for
tea
with
some
novel
under
my
arm
the
cathedral
bell
ringing
for
evensong
just
over
the
wall
across
the
green
then
slowly
dropping
to
its
close
then
the
faint
murmur
of
the
organ
some
bird
twittering
in
a
tree
overhead
buttered
toast
in
a
neat
pile
placed
carefully
over
hot
water
to
keep
it
warm
honey
heavy
cake
perhaps
the
local
weekly
paper
with
the
do
you
know
that
column
demanding
critical
attention
one
annoyed
because
some
tiresome
fellow
coming
to
luncheon
because
one
wishes
to
buy
some
china
that
one
ca
afford
because
the
wife
of
the
precentor
said
to
the
sister
that
young
trenchard
would
be
an
old
man
in
a
year
or
two
one
sips
one
tea
the
organ
leads
the
chants
the
sun
sinks
below
the
wall
that
this
there
the
forest
road
hot
like
iron
under
the
sun
it
winds
away
into
the
forest
but
so
far
as
the
eye
can
see
it
is
covered
with
things
that
have
been
left
by
flying
men
articles
swords
daggers
rifles
of
course
but
also
books
letters
a
underclothes
newspapers
these
tilings
in
thick
tangled
profusion
rifles
in
heaps
by
the
hundred
under
the
sun
up
and
down
the
road
there
are
dead
and
dying
russians
and
austrians
together
the
forest
is
both
above
and
below
the
road
and
from
out
of
it
there
comes
a
continual
screaming
there
is
every
note
in
this
babel
of
voices
mad
notes
plaintive
notes
angry
notes
whimpering
notes
one
wounded
man
is
very
slowly
trying
to
drag
himself
across
the
road
and
his
foot
which
is
nearly
severed
from
his
leg
waggles
behind
him
one
path
that
leads
from
the
road
to
the
forest
is
piled
with
bodies
and
is
a
stream
of
blood
some
of
the
dead
are
lying
very
quietly
in
the
ditch
their
heads
pillowed
on
their
arms
every
now
and
then
something
that
you
had
thought
dead
stirs
and
the
screaming
from
the
forest
is
incessant
so
that
you
simply
do
hear
the
shell
now
very
close
indeed
there
you
know
that
world
somewhere
with
the
rev
someone
lecturing
on
fools
and
the
class
costing
in
the
neighbourhood
of
at
least
it
very
important
if
i
to
continue
to
keep
my
head
steady
that
i
should
that
it
is
there
it
seemed
that
we
were
the
first
red
cross
people
to
arrive
oh
what
rewards
would
i
have
offered
for
another
ten
wagons
how
lamentably
insufficient
our
three
carts
appeared
standing
there
in
the
road
with
this
screaming
forest
on
every
side
of
one
as
i
waited
there
overwhelmed
by
the
blind
indifference
of
the
place
listening
still
to
the
incredible
birds
seeing
in
the
businesslike
attentions
of
my
sanitars
only
a
further
incredible
indifference
a
great
stream
of
soldiers
came
up
the
road
passing
into
the
first
line
of
trenches
only
a
little
deeper
in
the
forest
they
were
very
hot
the
perspiration
dripping
down
their
faces
but
they
went
through
to
the
position
without
a
glance
at
the
dead
and
wounded
no
concern
of
that
life
had
changed
they
had
changed
with
it
meanwhile
they
did
as
they
were
told
we
worked
there
filling
our
wagons
the
selection
was
a
horrible
difficulty
all
the
wounded
were
austrians
and
how
they
begged
not
to
be
left
it
would
be
many
hours
perhaps
before
the
next
red
cross
division
would
appear
an
awful
business
one
man
dying
in
the
wood
tore
at
his
stomach
with
an
unceasing
gesture
and
the
air
came
through
his
mouth
like
gas
screaming
through
an
escape
hole
one
austrian
quite
an
old
man
died
in
my
arms
in
the
middle
of
the
road
he
was
not
conscious
but
he
fumbled
for
his
which
he
gave
me
muttering
something
his
name
schneidher
gyorgy
pelmonoster
was
written
on
the
first
page
we
started
for
home
at
length
our
drive
back
was
terrible
i
find
that
i
can
not
linger
any
longer
over
this
affair
our
carts
drove
over
rough
stones
and
ruts
and
we
were
four
hours
on
the
journey
our
wounded
screamed
all
the
way
one
man
died
my
candle
is
nearly
out
i
must
find
another
in
one
of
its
frantic
leaps
just
now
i
fancied
that
i
saw
marie
standing
near
the
door
she
looked
just
as
she
always
did
very
kind
though
smiling
of
course
it
was
only
the
candle
i
must
be
careful
not
to
encourage
these
fancies
but
god
how
lonely
i
am
i
realise
i
suppose
that
there
is
one
single
living
soul
in
the
world
who
cares
whether
i
die
or
not
not
one
durward
will
remember
me
perhaps
no
one
else
and
marie
would
have
cared
yes
even
married
to
semyonov
she
would
have
cared
and
remembered
and
i
could
always
have
cared
for
her
been
her
friend
as
she
asked
me
i
pretty
low
if
i
could
sleep
boof
there
goes
the
candle
august
i
am
growing
accustomed
i
suppose
to
semyonov
company
after
all
his
contempt
for
me
is
an
old
thing
dating
from
the
very
first
moment
that
he
ever
saw
me
it
has
become
now
a
commonplace
to
both
of
us
he
is
very
silent
now
compared
with
the
old
days
there
has
been
much
work
yesterday
and
but
still
last
night
i
could
not
sleep
i
think
that
he
also
did
not
sleep
and
we
both
lay
there
in
the
dark
thinking
i
suppose
of
the
same
thing
i
thought
even
of
myself
my
sense
of
humour
has
never
been
very
strong
but
i
can
at
any
rate
see
that
i
am
no
very
fine
figure
in
life
and
that
whether
such
a
man
as
i
live
or
die
can
be
of
no
great
importance
to
any
one
or
anything
but
i
do
most
truly
desire
not
to
make
more
of
the
matter
than
is
just
a
man
may
have
felt
himself
the
most
insignificant
and
useless
of
human
creatures
all
his
days
but
face
him
with
death
and
he
becomes
by
very
force
of
the
contrast
something
of
a
figure
here
am
i
deprived
of
the
only
thing
in
life
that
gave
me
joy
or
pride
i
should
after
that
deprivation
have
slipped
back
i
suppose
to
my
old
life
of
hopeless
uninterest
and
insignificance
but
now
here
the
death
of
marie
ivanovna
has
been
no
check
at
all
i
half
believe
now
that
one
can
do
with
life
or
death
what
one
will
if
i
had
known
that
from
the
beginning
what
things
i
might
have
found
as
it
is
i
must
simply
make
the
best
of
it
semyonov
contempt
would
once
have
frightened
the
very
life
out
of
me
but
after
that
night
of
his
arrival
here
it
has
been
nothing
compared
with
the
excitement
of
our
relationship
the
things
that
are
keeping
us
together
in
spite
of
ourselves
and
the
strange
changes
i
do
believe
that
this
situation
here
is
making
in
him
the
loss
of
marie
ivanovna
would
two
months
ago
perhaps
have
finished
me
what
is
it
now
beside
the
wonder
as
to
whether
i
have
lost
her
after
all
the
consciousness
of
pursuit
the
longing
to
durward
and
i
have
spoken
sometimes
of
my
dream
of
the
forest
it
must
seem
to
him
now
as
to
myself
strangely
fulfilled
but
i
believe
that
if
i
catch
the
beast
it
will
only
be
to
discover
that
there
is
a
further
quest
beyond
and
then
another
maybe
beyond
that
at
the
same
time
there
the
practical
question
of
one
nerve
if
this
strain
of
work
continues
if
the
hot
weather
lasts
and
if
i
do
sleep
i
shall
have
to
take
care
three
times
during
the
last
three
days
i
have
fancied
that
i
have
seen
marie
ivanovna
once
in
broad
daylight
in
the
forest
once
sitting
on
the
sofa
in
our
room
once
at
night
near
my
bed
of
course
this
is
the
merest
illusion
but
i
have
hours
now
when
i
am
not
quite
sure
of
things
andrey
vassilievitch
told
me
something
of
the
same
that
he
thought
that
he
saw
his
wife
and
that
nikitin
told
him
the
same
yesterday
the
flies
also
are
confusing
and
there
a
hot
dry
smell
disagreeable
and
prevents
one
from
eating
i
know
that
i
must
keep
a
clear
head
on
these
things
if
only
one
could
get
away
for
an
hour
or
two
right
outside
but
one
is
shut
up
in
this
forest
as
though
it
were
a
green
oven
i
ought
to
be
sleeping
now
instead
of
writing
all
this
i
must
say
that
i
had
a
curious
illusion
ten
minutes
ago
while
i
was
writing
this
that
one
of
the
wounded
in
a
bed
near
the
door
which
is
open
began
to
slip
bed
and
all
across
the
floor
towards
me
he
did
indeed
come
closer
and
closer
to
me
the
bed
moving
in
jerks
as
though
it
were
pushed
this
was
of
course
simply
because
my
eyes
were
tired
when
i
try
to
sleep
they
are
hot
and
smarting
i
interrupt
trenchard
diary
to
give
a
very
brief
account
of
the
impression
that
was
made
on
me
by
my
visit
to
the
three
of
them
with
some
wagons
four
days
after
the
date
of
the
above
entry
it
must
be
remembered
that
i
had
not
of
course
at
this
time
read
any
of
trenchard
diary
nor
had
i
seen
anything
of
him
since
the
moment
of
semyonov
arrival
my
chief
impression
during
the
interval
had
been
my
memory
of
trenchard
as
i
had
last
seen
him
miserable
unnerved
i
had
thought
about
him
a
good
deal
those
days
at
the
otriad
had
been
for
the
rest
of
us
rather
pleasantly
tranquil
there
was
no
question
that
we
were
relieved
by
the
absence
of
semyonov
and
trenchard
semyonov
was
no
easy
companion
at
any
time
and
we
had
the
very
natural
desire
to
throw
off
from
us
the
weight
of
marie
ivanovna
unexpected
death
i
will
not
speak
of
myself
in
this
matter
but
for
the
others
she
had
not
been
very
long
in
their
company
she
had
been
strange
and
unsettled
in
her
behaviour
she
had
been
engaged
to
a
man
jilted
him
and
engaged
herself
to
another
all
within
a
very
short
period
of
time
i
myself
was
occupied
incessantly
by
my
thoughts
of
her
but
that
was
my
own
affair
the
past
week
then
with
us
had
been
tranquil
and
easy
on
my
arrival
at
the
point
in
the
forest
i
was
met
at
once
by
a
new
atmosphere
for
one
thing
the
war
here
was
on
the
very
top
of
us
only
a
few
yards
away
towards
the
end
of
the
garden
they
were
digging
trenches
somewhere
beyond
the
windows
in
the
forest
a
battery
had
established
itself
near
a
clearing
at
the
edge
of
a
hill
the
guns
disguised
with
leaves
and
branches
soldiers
were
moving
incessantly
to
and
fro
the
house
seemed
full
of
wounded
wagons
coming
and
going
they
were
digging
graves
in
the
garden
and
sheeted
bodies
were
lying
in
the
orchard
my
friends
greeted
me
seemed
glad
to
see
me
for
a
moment
and
then
pursued
their
business
i
was
entirely
outside
their
life
only
ten
days
before
i
had
felt
a
closer
intimacy
with
trenchard
andrey
vassilievitch
and
nikitin
than
i
had
ever
had
with
any
of
them
now
i
simply
did
not
exist
for
them
it
was
not
the
work
that
excluded
me
the
evening
that
passed
then
was
an
easy
evening
very
little
to
do
we
spent
most
of
the
night
in
playing
no
it
was
not
the
work
it
was
quite
simply
that
something
was
happening
to
all
of
them
in
which
i
had
no
concern
they
were
all
changed
and
about
them
all
yes
even
i
believe
about
semyonov
there
was
an
air
of
suppressed
excitement
rather
the
excitement
that
schoolboys
have
when
they
have
prepared
some
secret
forbidden
defiance
or
adventure
trenchard
whom
i
had
left
in
the
depths
of
a
lethargic
depression
was
most
curiously
preoccupied
he
looked
at
me
first
as
though
he
did
not
perfectly
remember
me
he
assuredly
was
not
well
his
eyes
were
lined
heavily
his
white
cheeks
had
a
flush
of
red
that
burnt
there
feverishly
and
he
seemed
extraordinarily
thin
he
was
restless
his
eyes
were
never
still
and
i
saw
him
sometimes
fix
them
in
a
strange
way
upon
some
object
as
though
he
would
assure
himself
that
it
was
there
he
was
obviously
under
the
influence
of
some
deep
excitement
he
told
me
that
he
was
sleeping
badly
that
his
head
ached
and
that
his
eyes
hurt
him
but
he
did
not
seem
distressed
by
these
things
he
was
too
strongly
absorbed
by
something
to
be
depressed
he
treated
me
and
everything
around
him
with
impatience
as
though
he
could
not
wait
for
something
that
he
was
expecting
i
have
seen
in
this
business
of
the
war
strange
things
that
nerves
can
do
with
the
human
mind
and
body
i
have
seen
many
men
who
remain
with
their
nerves
as
strong
as
steel
from
the
first
to
the
last
but
this
is
i
should
say
the
exception
and
only
to
be
found
with
men
of
a
very
unimaginative
character
as
regards
trenchard
one
must
take
into
account
his
recent
loss
the
sudden
stress
of
incessant
exhausting
work
the
flaming
weather
and
the
constant
companionship
of
the
one
human
being
of
all
others
most
calculated
to
disturb
his
tranquillity
but
in
varying
degrees
i
think
that
every
one
in
this
place
was
at
this
time
working
under
a
strain
of
something
abnormal
and
uncalculated
the
very
knowledge
that
the
attack
was
now
being
pressed
severely
and
that
we
had
so
little
ammunition
with
which
to
reply
was
enough
to
strain
the
nerves
of
every
one
trenchard
told
me
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
that
i
had
with
him
during
my
second
stay
that
his
visit
to
the
lines
some
days
earlier
this
is
the
visit
of
which
he
speaks
in
his
diary
had
greatly
upset
him
he
had
been
disturbed
apparently
by
the
fact
that
there
were
not
sufficient
wagons
the
whole
sense
of
the
forest
he
told
me
was
a
strain
to
him
the
feeling
that
he
could
not
escape
from
it
the
thought
of
its
colour
and
heat
and
at
the
same
time
its
ugliness
and
horror
the
cholera
scarecrow
in
it
and
the
deserted
town
and
all
the
horrors
of
the
recent
attacks
the
dead
austrians
and
russians
but
i
repeat
most
emphatically
that
he
was
not
depressed
by
this
it
was
rather
that
he
wished
to
keep
his
energies
fresh
and
clear
for
some
purpose
of
his
own
and
was
therefore
disturbed
by
anything
that
threatened
his
health
he
was
not
quite
well
he
told
me
headaches
not
sleeping
but
that
he
had
it
well
in
control
and
here
now
is
a
strange
thing
one
of
the
chief
purposes
of
my
visit
had
been
to
persuade
one
of
the
four
men
to
return
with
me
to
the
otriad
molozov
had
asserted
very
emphatically
that
none
of
them
should
be
compelled
against
their
will
to
return
to
mittövo
but
he
thought
that
it
would
be
well
if
considering
the
strain
of
the
work
and
the
position
they
were
to
take
it
in
turns
to
have
a
day
or
two
rest
and
so
relieve
one
another
i
had
had
no
doubt
that
this
would
be
very
acceptable
to
them
but
on
my
proposing
it
was
surprised
to
receive
from
each
of
them
individually
an
abrupt
refusal
even
to
consider
the
matter
at
the
same
time
they
assured
me
severally
that
the
one
or
the
other
of
them
needed
very
badly
a
rest
after
i
had
spoken
nikitin
taking
me
aside
told
me
that
he
thought
that
andrey
vassilievitch
would
be
better
at
mittövo
he
is
a
little
in
the
way
here
he
said
certainly
he
does
his
best
but
this
is
not
his
place
nikitin
wore
the
same
preoccupied
air
as
the
whatever
you
do
he
said
do
let
andrey
know
that
i
spoke
to
you
andrey
vassilievitch
on
his
side
with
much
nervousness
and
told
me
that
he
thought
that
nikitin
was
suffering
from
overwork
and
needed
a
complete
rest
you
know
ivan
andreievitch
he
is
really
not
at
all
well
i
sleep
in
the
same
room
he
talks
in
his
sleep
fancies
that
he
sees
things
very
odd
although
this
hot
weather
i
myself
for
the
matter
of
that
and
then
he
nervously
broke
off
but
with
all
this
they
did
not
seem
to
quarrel
with
one
another
it
is
true
that
i
discovered
a
kind
of
impatience
especially
between
andrey
vassilievitch
and
nikitin
the
kind
of
restlessness
that
you
see
sometimes
between
two
horses
which
are
harnessed
together
semyonov
he
paid
no
attention
to
me
at
all
during
my
visit
treated
trenchard
quite
decently
and
i
observed
on
several
occasions
his
look
of
puzzled
curiosity
at
the
man
a
look
to
which
i
have
alluded
before
he
spoke
to
him
always
in
the
tone
of
contemptuous
banter
that
he
had
from
the
beginning
used
to
him
well
i
suppose
that
you
could
bring
a
big
enough
bandage
however
much
you
were
asked
to
but
why
choose
the
smallest
possible
or
that
where
writes
his
poetry
being
a
nice
romantic
englishman
is
it
but
i
was
greatly
struck
by
trenchard
manner
of
taking
these
remarks
he
behaved
now
as
though
he
had
secret
reasons
for
knowing
that
he
was
in
every
way
as
good
a
man
as
semyonov
a
better
one
maybe
he
laughed
or
sometimes
simply
looked
at
his
companion
or
he
would
reply
in
his
bad
halting
russian
with
some
jest
at
expense
finally
to
end
this
business
if
ever
a
man
were
affected
to
the
heart
by
the
loss
of
a
friend
or
a
lover
semyonov
was
that
man
he
was
a
man
too
strong
in
himself
and
too
contemptuous
of
weakness
to
show
to
all
the
world
his
hurt
i
myself
might
have
seen
nothing
had
i
not
always
before
me
the
memory
of
that
vision
of
his
face
between
the
trees
but
from
that
i
had
proceeded
it
was
i
suppose
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
the
fulfilment
of
his
desire
had
been
denied
him
had
marie
ivanovna
lived
and
had
he
attained
with
her
his
complete
satisfaction
he
would
have
tired
of
her
perhaps
as
he
had
tired
of
many
others
and
have
remained
only
the
stronger
cynic
but
she
had
eluded
him
eluded
him
at
the
very
moment
of
her
freshness
and
happiness
and
triumph
what
defeat
to
his
proud
spirit
was
working
now
in
him
what
longing
what
fierce
determination
to
secure
even
now
his
ends
the
change
that
i
fancied
in
him
was
perhaps
no
more
than
his
bracing
of
his
strength
and
courage
to
face
new
conditions
death
had
robbed
him
of
his
possession
so
much
the
worse
then
for
death
upon
this
day
of
icy
cold
as
i
write
these
words
i
am
afraid
that
my
account
may
be
taken
as
an
extravagant
and
unjustified
conceit
but
that
i
do
most
honestly
believe
it
not
to
be
i
myself
felt
during
my
two
days
stay
in
that
place
the
strangest
contact
with
new
experiences
new
developments
new
relationships
normal
life
had
been
left
utterly
behind
and
there
was
nothing
to
remind
one
of
it
save
perhaps
that
report
on
new
mexico
still
there
on
the
dusty
table
but
there
was
the
heat
there
were
the
wheeling
circling
clouds
of
flies
now
in
lines
now
in
squares
now
broken
like
smoke
now
dim
like
vapour
there
was
that
old
familiar
smell
of
dust
and
flesh
chemicals
and
blood
there
were
the
men
dying
and
broken
fighting
like
giants
defeating
fears
and
terrors
that
hung
like
grey
shadows
about
the
doors
and
windows
of
the
house
every
incident
and
experience
that
we
had
had
at
the
war
every
incident
and
experience
that
i
have
related
in
these
pages
seemed
to
be
gathered
into
this
house
as
i
look
back
upon
it
now
it
seems
without
any
extravagance
at
all
the
very
heart
of
the
fortress
of
the
enemy
i
do
not
mean
in
the
least
that
life
was
solemn
or
pretentious
or
heavy
it
was
careless
casual
as
liable
to
the
ridiculous
intervention
of
unimportant
things
as
ever
it
had
been
but
it
was
life
pressed
so
close
to
the
fine
presence
of
fate
that
you
could
hear
the
very
beating
of
his
heart
and
this
fortress
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
who
was
watching
outside
the
lives
of
these
others
an
observer
only
whom
perhaps
this
same
fate
despised
asked
of
god
a
sign
i
saw
suddenly
here
the
connexion
for
which
i
had
been
waiting
between
the
four
men
there
they
were
nikitin
and
andrey
semyonov
and
trenchard
two
wise
men
and
two
fools
surely
the
rivalry
was
ludicrous
in
its
inequality
and
yet
god
does
not
judge
as
men
do
nikitin
and
semyonov
or
andrey
and
trenchard
who
would
be
taken
and
who
left
i
recalled
semyonov
jesting
words
even
though
it
the
wise
men
succeed
in
this
world
i
do
doubt
it
the
fools
have
their
way
in
the
next
i
waited
for
my
sign
last
of
all
i
can
hear
it
objected
that
every
one
was
surely
too
busy
to
attend
to
relationships
or
shades
of
relationships
but
it
was
this
very
thing
that
contributed
to
the
situation
namely
that
in
the
very
stress
of
the
work
there
were
hours
many
hours
when
there
was
simply
nothing
to
be
done
then
if
one
could
not
sleep
times
were
bad
indeed
moreover
even
in
the
throng
of
work
itself
one
would
be
conscious
of
that
slipping
off
from
one
of
all
the
trappings
of
reality
one
by
one
they
would
slip
away
and
then
bewildered
one
would
doubt
the
evidence
of
one
eyes
one
brain
one
ears
the
fatigue
hammering
hammering
at
one
consciousness
i
have
known
what
that
kind
of
strain
can
be
i
left
on
the
second
morning
after
my
arrival
and
returned
to
mittövo
alone
diary
tuesday
august
durward
has
been
here
for
two
days
he
a
good
fellow
but
i
seem
rather
to
have
lost
touch
with
him
during
these
last
days
then
he
rather
bloodless
a
little
more
humour
would
cheer
him
up
wonderfully
we
all
been
in
mad
spirits
as
though
we
were
drunk
the
battery
officers
have
got
a
gramophone
that
we
turned
on
we
danced
a
bit
although
it
hot
as
hell
then
in
the
evening
my
spirits
suddenly
went
andrey
vassilievitch
gets
on
one
nerves
his
voice
is
tiresome
and
tired
of
his
wife
he
tells
me
that
he
thinks
he
sees
her
at
night
do
i
think
it
likely
silly
little
ass
just
the
way
to
rot
his
nerves
funny
thing
we
were
playing
suddenly
semyonov
said
supposing
molozov
says
that
only
one
of
us
is
to
stay
on
here
there
was
silence
after
that
we
all
four
looked
at
one
another
all
i
knew
was
nothing
was
going
to
move
me
away
from
this
place
if
i
could
help
it
then
semyonov
said
of
course
i
would
have
to
stay
we
went
for
him
then
you
should
have
heard
nikitin
i
did
believe
that
he
had
it
in
him
semyonov
was
quiet
of
course
smiling
that
beastly
smile
of
his
then
at
last
he
said
suppose
we
play
for
it
we
agreed
the
one
who
turned
up
the
ace
of
hearts
was
to
stay
you
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
after
that
i
have
never
before
felt
what
i
felt
then
if
i
had
to
return
and
leave
semyonov
here
they
say
that
the
attack
may
develop
in
this
direction
at
any
moment
if
semyonov
were
to
be
here
and
i
not
and
yet
what
was
it
that
i
wanted
what
i
want
is
to
be
close
to
marie
again
to
be
there
where
semyonov
can
not
reach
us
i
believe
that
she
might
always
have
cared
for
me
if
he
had
not
been
there
whatever
death
may
be
i
must
if
there
is
nothing
more
no
matter
if
there
something
more
then
there
is
something
for
her
as
well
as
for
me
and
i
shall
find
her
and
i
must
find
her
alone
there
nothing
left
in
life
now
to
me
save
that
as
i
sat
there
looking
at
the
cards
i
knew
all
this
knew
quite
clearly
that
i
must
escape
semyonov
there
no
madness
in
this
whilst
he
is
there
i
nothing
but
without
him
if
i
were
with
her
again
i
was
always
beaten
easily
by
anybody
but
in
this
at
least
i
can
be
strong
i
do
hate
him
but
i
know
that
he
will
always
be
first
as
long
as
we
together
and
we
seem
to
be
tied
now
like
dogs
by
their
tails
tied
by
our
thoughts
of
marie
well
anyway
i
turned
up
the
ace
my
heart
seemed
to
jump
right
upside
down
when
i
saw
it
the
others
said
nothing
only
semyonov
at
last
well
if
it
comes
to
it
we
have
to
see
that
it
necessary
for
of
us
to
be
here
it
will
never
do
for
you
and
me
to
be
parted
meanwhile
the
firing
very
close

say

diary
saturday
august
captain
t
died
this
afternoon
at
a
considerable
shock
to
me
he
was
so
young
so
strong
they
all
said
that
he
had
a
remarkable
future
he
had
dined
with
us
several
times
at
mittövo
and
his
vitality
had
always
attracted
me
vitality
restrained
and
drilled
towards
some
definite
purpose
he
might
have
been
a
great
man
his
wound
in
the
stomach
did
not
hurt
him
i
think
he
was
wonderfully
calm
at
the
last
how
strange
it
is
that
at
home
death
is
so
horrible
with
its
long
ceremonies
its
crowd
of
relations
its
gradual
decay
and
here
in
nine
out
of
every
ten
deaths
that
i
have
seen
there
has
been
peace
or
even
happiness
this
is
the
merest
truth
and
will
be
confirmed
by
any
one
who
has
worked
here
again
and
again
i
have
seen
that
strange
flash
of
surprised
almost
startled
interest
again
and
again
i
have
been
conscious
not
the
eyes
of
the
expression
of
one
who
is
startled
by
fresh
conditions
a
fine
view
a
sudden
piece
of
news
this
is
no
argument
for
religion
for
any
creed
or
dogma
i
only
say
that
here
it
is
so
that
death
seems
to
be
happiness
and
the
beginning
of
something
new
and
unexpected
i
believe
that
even
so
hardy
a
cynic
as
semyonov
would
support
me
in
this
i
and
semyonov
were
alone
with
young
captain
t
when
he
died
semyonov
had
liked
the
man
and
had
done
everything
possible
to
save
him
but
he
was
absorbed
by
his
death
as
though
he
would
tear
the
secret
of
it
from
the
body
that
looked
suddenly
so
empty
and
so
meaningless
well
i
glad
he
was
happy
he
said
to
me
then
he
stood
looking
at
me
curiously
i
returned
the
look
we
neither
of
us
said
anything
these
are
all
commonplaces
i
suppose
that
i
am
discovering
the
only
importance
is
that
some
ten
million
human
beings
are
in
this
war
making
these
discoveries
for
themselves
just
as
i
am
who
can
tell
what
that
may
mean
i
have
seen
here
no
visions
nor
have
i
met
any
one
who
has
seen
them
but
there
are
undoubted
facts
not
easy
things
to
discount
august
things
are
pretty
bad
here
the
austrians
have
taken
vulatch
both
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
they
have
advanced
they
may
arrive
here
at
any
moment
the
magnificence
of
the
russian
soldier
is
surely
beyond
all
praise
i
wonder
whether
people
in
france
and
england
realise
that
for
the
last
three
months
here
he
has
been
fighting
with
one
bullet
as
against
ten
he
stands
in
his
trench
practically
unarmed
against
an
enemy
whose
resources
seem
endless
but
nothing
can
turn
him
back
whatever
advances
the
germans
may
make
i
see
russia
returning
again
and
again
i
do
from
the
bottom
of
my
soul
and
what
is
of
more
importance
from
the
sober
witness
of
my
eyes
here
believe
that
nothing
can
stop
the
impetus
born
of
her
new
spirit
this
war
is
the
beginning
of
a
world
history
for
her
krylov
this
afternoon
said
that
he
thought
that
we
should
leave
this
place
get
out
our
wagons
and
retire
but
how
can
we
at
this
moment
how
can
we
we
are
just
now
at
the
most
critical
meeting
of
the
ways
the
extra
twelve
versts
back
to
mittövo
may
make
the
whole
difference
to
many
of
the
cases
and
the
doctors
of
the
division
krylov
himself
admits
have
got
their
arms
full
we
simply
leave
them
there
has
been
some
confusion
here
there
does
seem
any
responsible
person
to
give
us
orders
colonel
maximoff
has
forgotten
us
i
believe
in
any
case
i
think
that
we
must
stay
on
here
for
another
day
and
night
perhaps
we
shall
get
away
i
had
a
queer
experience
this
afternoon
i
do
want
to
make
too
much
of
it
but
here
it
is
i
went
up
to
my
room
this
afternoon
at
five
to
get
some
sleep
as
i
on
duty
i
lay
down
and
shut
my
eyes
and
then
of
course
as
i
always
do
immediately
saw
marie
ivanovna
i
know
quite
clearly
that
this
present
relationship
to
her
can
not
continue
for
long
or
i
shall
be
off
my
head
i
can
see
myself
quite
clearly
as
though
i
were
outside
myself
and
i
know
that
i
madder
now
than
i
was
a
week
ago
for
instance
in
this
business
of
marie
ivanovna
i
knew
then
that
my
seeing
her
was
an
illusion
now
i
am
not
quite
sure
i
knew
a
week
ago
that
i
saw
her
because
she
is
so
much
in
my
thoughts
because
of
the
intolerable
heat
because
of
the
flies
and
the
forest
because
of
semyonov
i
am
not
sure
now
whether
it
is
not
wish
that
i
should
see
her
she
comes
as
she
came
on
those
last
days
before
she
left
me
with
all
the
kindness
in
her
eyes
that
no
other
human
being
has
ever
given
me
before
nor
will
ever
give
me
again
i
looked
and
was
not
sure
whether
she
were
gone
or
no
i
was
not
sure
of
several
things
in
the
room
and
as
i
lay
there
i
said
to
myself
is
that
really
a
or
no
if
i
tried
could
i
touch
it
or
would
it
fade
from
under
my
hand
the
room
was
intolerably
close
and
there
was
a
fly
who
persecuted
me
as
i
lay
there
he
came
and
settled
on
my
hand
he
waited
watching
me
with
his
wicked
sneering
eyes
then
he
crept
forward
and
waited
again
rubbing
his
legs
one
against
the
other
then
very
slyly
laughing
to
himself
he
began
to
tickle
me
i
slashed
with
my
hand
at
him
he
flew
into
the
air
sneering
then
with
a
little
ping
settled
on
the
back
of
my
neck
i
vowed
that
i
would
not
mind
him
i
lay
still
he
began
then
to
crawl
very
slowly
forward
towards
my
chin
and
it
was
as
though
he
were
dragging
spidery
strands
of
nerves
through
my
body
fitting
them
all
on
to
stiff
tight
wires
he
reached
my
chin
and
then
again
sneering
up
into
my
eyes
he
began
to
tickle
i
thought
once
more
that
i
had
him
but
once
again
he
was
in
the
air
then
after
waiting
until
i
had
almost
sunk
back
into
sleep
he
did
the
worst
thing
that
a
fly
can
do
began
very
slowly
to
crawl
down
the
inside
of
my
i
had
been
trying
to
read
he
got
between
the
glass
and
my
eyelash
and
moved
very
faintly
with
his
damnable
legs
then
my
patience
went
i
did
what
during
these
last
days
i
have
vowed
not
to
do
lost
my
control
jumped
from
my
bed
and
cursed
with
rage
then
with
my
head
almost
bursting
with
heat
and
my
legs
trembling
i
had
an
awful
moment
i
thought
that
i
was
really
mad
i
thought
that
i
would
get
the
and
smash
it
and
that
then
i
would
jump
from
the
window
in
another
moment
i
thought
that
something
would
break
in
my
head
the
something
with
which
i
kept
control
over
myself
i
seemed
to
hear
myself
praying
aloud
oh
god
let
me
keep
my
reason
oh
god
let
me
keep
my
reason
and
i
could
see
the
forest
like
a
great
green
hot
wave
rising
beyond
the
window
to
a
towering
height
ready
to
leap
down
upon
me
then
semyonov
came
in
he
stood
in
the
doorway
and
looked
at
me
he
must
have
thought
me
strange
and
i
know
that
i
waited
staring
at
him
feeling
foolish
as
i
always
do
with
him
but
he
spoke
to
me
kindly
with
the
sort
of
kindness
that
there
is
sometimes
in
his
voice
patronising
and
reluctant
of
course
you
ca
sleep
he
said
no
i
answered
and
said
something
about
flies
what
have
you
been
doing
to
the
he
asked
laughing
for
there
the
thing
was
on
the
floor
broken
into
pieces
i
am
sure
that
i
never
touched
it
that
unlucky
he
said
never
mind
he
said
smiling
at
me
misfortunes
are
you
always
dropping
something
he
added
quite
kindly
more
perhaps
than
the
rest
of
us
wash
your
face
in
cold
water
it
this
infernal
heat
that
worries
us
all
i
remember
then
that
he
poured
the
water
into
the
blue
tin
basin
for
me
and
then
taking
the
tin
mug
himself
poured
it
in
cupfuls
over
my
hands
and
arms
i
afterwards
did
the
same
for
him
at
that
moment
i
very
nearly
spoke
to
him
of
marie
i
wished
desperately
to
try
but
i
looked
at
his
face
and
his
eyes
laughing
at
me
as
they
always
did
stopped
me
when
i
had
finished
he
thanked
me
wiped
his
hands
then
turning
round
at
the
door
he
said
why
do
you
go
back
to
mittövo
you
tired
out
you
know
why
i
answered
without
looking
at
him
he
seemed
then
as
though
he
would
speak
but
he
stopped
himself
and
went
away
i
lay
down
again
and
tried
to
sleep
but
when
i
closed
my
eyes
the
green
beyond
the
window
burnt
through
my
eyelids
and
then
the
fly
i
am
sure
it
was
the
same
fly
returned
august
lord
but
i
am
tired
of
this
endless
bandaging
cleaning
of
filthy
wounds
paring
away
of
ragged
ends
of
flesh
smelling
breathing
drinking
blood
and
dust
and
dirt
the
poor
fellows
their
bravery
is
beyond
any
word
of
mine
they
have
come
these
last
few
days
with
their
eyes
dazed
and
their
ears
deafened
indeed
the
roaring
of
the
cannon
has
been
since
yesterday
afternoon
incessant
they
say
that
the
austrians
are
straining
every
nerve
to
break
through
to
the
river
and
cross
we
are
doing
what
we
can
to
prevent
them
but
what
can
we
do
there
simply
is
not
ammunition
the
officers
here
are
almost
crying
with
despair
and
the
men
know
it
and
go
on
with
their
cheerfulness
their
obedience
their
mild
kindliness
go
into
that
green
hell
to
be
butchered
and
come
out
of
it
again
if
they
are
lucky
with
their
bodies
mangled
and
twisted
and
horror
in
their
eyes
it
nobody
fault
i
suppose
this
business
how
easy
to
write
in
the
daily
papers
that
the
germans
prepared
for
war
and
that
we
did
not
and
that
after
a
month
or
two
all
will
be
well
after
a
month
or
two
tell
that
to
us
here
stuck
in
this
forest
and
hear
us
how
we
laugh
meanwhile
for
the
good
of
my
health
i
figuring
very
clearly
to
myself
all
the
physical
features
of
this
place
it
a
long
white
house
the
front
door
has
broken
glass
over
it
and
there
a
litter
of
tumbled
bricks
on
the
top
step
after
you
gone
through
the
front
door
you
come
into
the
hall
where
the
wounded
are
as
thick
as
flies
you
go
through
the
hall
and
turn
to
the
left
a
pantry
place
on
your
right
all
full
of
flies
and
when
you
open
the
door
they
unsettle
with
a
great
buzz
and
shift
into
all
sorts
of
shapes
and
patterns
next
to
them
is
our
the
horrid
place
always
dirty
and
stifling
then
there
the
then
another
room
for
beds
then
the
kitchen
outside
to
the
right
the
garden
dry
now
with
the
heat
and
the
orchard
smells
of
the
men
they
buried
in
it
to
the
left
after
a
little
clearing
the
forest
always
green
and
glittering
the
men
are
in
the
trenches
now
the
new
ones
that
were
made
last
week
so
i
suppose
that
we
shall
be
in
the
thick
of
it
very
shortly
that
battery
at
the
edge
of
the
hill
has
been
banging
away
all
the
morning
what
else
is
there
there
an
old
pump
just
outside
the
window
there
a
litter
of
dirty
paper
and
refuse
there
too
that
the
flies
gather
round
there
an
old
barn
away
to
the
right
where
some
horses
are
and
two
cows
i
have
to
keep
my
mind
on
these
things
because
i
know
they
real
you
can
touch
them
with
your
hands
and
they
still
be
there
even
if
you
go
away
they
wo
walk
with
you
as
you
move
so
i
must
fasten
on
to
these
things
about
which
there
ca
be
any
doubt
in
the
same
way
i
like
to
remember
that
book
in
the
glass
who
lectured
on
fools
the
ruysdael
and
the
normal
pupils
who
acted
they
real
enough
and
are
probably
somewhere
now
quietly
studying
or
teaching
or
sleeping
i
envy
them
a
thing
that
happened
this
morning
disturbed
us
all
four
soldiers
came
out
of
the
forest
quite
mad
they
seemed
rational
enough
at
first
and
said
that
they
been
sent
out
of
the
first
line
trenches
with
contusion
one
of
them
had
a
bleeding
finger
but
the
others
were
untouched
then
one
of
them
a
man
with
a
black
beard
began
quite
gravely
to
tell
us
that
the
forest
was
moving
they
had
seen
it
with
their
own
eyes
they
had
watched
all
the
trees
march
slowly
forward
like
columns
of
soldiers
and
soon
the
whole
forest
would
move
and
would
crush
every
one
in
it
it
was
all
very
well
fighting
austrians
but
whole
forests
was
more
than
any
one
could
expect
of
them
then
suddenly
one
of
them
cried
out
pointing
with
his
finger
see
your
honour
there
it
comes
ah
let
us
run
let
us
run
one
of
them
began
to
cry
it
was
very
disagreeable
i
saw
andrey
vassilievitch
who
was
present
glance
anxiously
through
the
window
at
the
forest
and
then
gravely
check
himself
and
look
at
me
nervously
to
see
whether
i
had
noticed
the
men
afterwards
fell
into
a
strange
kind
of
apathy
we
sent
them
off
to
mittövo
in
the
afternoon
i
want
now
to
remember
as
exactly
as
possible
a
strange
conversation
i
had
this
evening
with
semyonov
i
came
up
when
it
was
getting
dusk
to
the
bedroom
one
of
the
austrian
batteries
was
spitting
away
over
the
hill
but
we
were
not
replying
everything
this
afternoon
has
looked
as
though
they
were
preparing
for
a
heavy
attack
our
little
window
was
open
and
the
sky
beyond
was
a
sort
of
very
pale
green
and
against
this
you
could
see
a
flush
of
colour
rising
and
falling
like
the
opening
and
shutting
of
a
door
everything
quite
silent
except
the
austrian
cannon
and
a
soldier
delirious
downstairs
singing
the
forest
was
deep
black
but
you
could
see
the
soldiers
fires
gleaming
here
and
there
like
beasts
eyes
our
room
was
almost
dark
and
i
was
very
startled
to
find
semyonov
sitting
on
his
bed
and
staring
in
front
of
him
he
looked
like
a
wooden
figure
sitting
there
and
he
did
move
as
i
came
in
i
glad
that
although
i
still
awkward
and
clumsy
with
him
as
i
am
and
always
will
be
i
suppose
with
every
one
i
not
afraid
of
him
any
more
the
room
was
so
dark
that
he
looked
like
a
shadow
i
had
intended
to
fetch
something
and
go
away
but
instead
of
that
i
sat
down
on
my
bed
feeling
suddenly
very
tired
and
lethargic
well
he
said
in
the
ironical
voice
he
always
uses
to
me
i
would
wish
now
to
repeat
if
i
can
every
word
of
our
conversation
krylov
has
been
again
i
said
he
told
nikitin
that
we
ought
to
go
nikitin
asked
him
whether
the
division
had
plenty
of
wagons
and
krylov
admitted
that
there
were
nearly
enough
he
agreed
that
it
would
make
a
lot
of
difference
if
we
could
keep
this
place
going
until
night
all
the
same
he
advised
us
to
leave
we
stay
until
some
one
orders
us
to
go
said
semyonov
it
will
make
a
difference
to
a
hundred
men
or
more
probably
if
they
do
start
firing
on
to
this
place
we
can
get
the
men
off
in
the
wagons
in
time
and
what
if
the
wagons
have
left
for
mittövo
we
have
to
wait
until
they
come
back
he
answered
we
sat
there
listening
to
the
cannon
then
semyonov
said
very
quietly
and
not
at
all
ironically
i
wish
to
ask
you
i
have
wished
before
tell
me
you
blame
me
for
her
death
i
thought
for
a
moment
then
i
replied
i
did
so
at
first
now
i
do
not
think
that
it
had
anything
to
do
with
you
or
with
me
or
with
any
one
except
herself
except
herself
he
said
what
do
you
mean
she
wished
it
i
think
his
irony
returned
you
believe
in
the
power
of
others
too
much
you
should
believe
more
in
your
own
i
believe
in
her
power
she
was
stronger
than
you
i
answered
i
sure
that
you
like
to
think
so
he
said
laughing
she
is
still
stronger
than
you
so
you
are
a
mystic
he
said
of
course
with
your
romantic
mind
that
is
only
natural
you
believe
i
suppose
that
she
is
with
us
here
in
the
room
it
can
not
be
of
interest
to
you
i
answered
quietly
what
i
believe
yes
it
is
of
interest
he
replied
in
a
voice
that
was
friendly
and
humorously
indulgent
as
though
he
spoke
to
a
child
i
find
it
strange
i
have
found
it
strange
for
many
weeks
now
that
i
should
think
so
frequently
of
you
you
are
not
a
man
who
would
naturally
be
interesting
to
me
you
are
an
englishman
and
i
am
not
interested
in
englishmen
you
are
sentimental
you
have
no
idea
of
life
as
it
is
you
like
dull
things
dull
safe
things
you
believe
always
in
what
you
are
told
you
have
no
sense
of
humour
you
should
be
of
no
interest
to
me
and
yet
during
these
last
weeks
i
have
not
been
able
to
get
rid
of
you
that
is
not
my
fault
i
said
i
have
not
been
so
anxious
for
your
company
no
he
said
speaking
rather
thoughtfully
as
though
he
were
seriously
thinking
something
out
you
regard
me
of
course
as
a
very
bad
character
i
have
no
desire
to
defend
myself
to
you
but
the
point
is
that
i
have
found
myself
often
thinking
of
you
that
i
have
even
taken
trouble
sometimes
to
be
with
you
he
waited
as
though
he
expected
me
to
say
something
but
i
was
silent
it
was
perhaps
that
i
saw
that
marie
ivanovna
cared
for
you
she
gave
you
up
to
the
end
something
that
she
never
gave
to
me
that
i
suppose
was
tiresome
to
me
you
thought
you
knew
her
i
said
hoping
to
hurt
him
you
did
not
know
her
at
all
that
may
be
he
answered
i
certainly
did
not
understand
her
but
that
was
attractive
to
me
and
so
you
thought
that
understood
her
but
i
did
not
answer
him
my
head
ached
frantically
i
was
wretchedly
in
want
of
sleep
i
jumped
to
my
feet
standing
in
front
of
him
leave
me
alone
leave
me
alone
i
cried
let
us
part
i
am
nothing
to
you
you
despise
me
and
laugh
at
me
you
have
from
the
first
done
so
it
was
because
you
laughed
at
me
that
she
began
to
laugh
if
you
had
not
been
there
she
might
have
continued
to
love
me
she
was
very
inexperienced
and
now
that
she
is
gone
i
am
of
no
more
importance
to
you
let
me
be
for
god
sake
let
me
be
you
are
free
he
said
you
can
return
to
mittövo
in
an
hour
time
when
the
wagons
go
i
did
not
speak
no
you
will
not
go
he
went
on
because
you
think
that
she
is
here
she
died
here
and
you
believe
that
she
is
not
dead
i
also
will
not
go
for
my
own
reasons
then
he
jumped
off
his
bed
stood
upright
against
me
his
clothes
touching
mine
he
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
no
we
will
remain
together
i
find
you
really
rather
charming
and
you
are
changed
you
know
you
are
not
the
silly
fool
you
were
when
you
first
came
to
us
i
moved
away
from
him
i
could
not
bear
the
touch
of
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
i
had
i
repeat
no
fear
of
him
he
might
laugh
at
me
or
no
as
he
pleased
but
i
did
not
want
his
kindness
my
beliefs
seem
to
you
the
beliefs
of
a
child
i
said
trying
to
speak
more
calmly
well
then
leave
me
to
them
they
at
least
do
you
no
harm
i
love
her
now
as
i
loved
her
when
i
first
saw
her
i
can
not
believe
that
i
shall
never
be
with
her
again
but
that
is
my
own
affair
and
matters
to
no
one
but
myself
he
answered
me
you
have
a
simple
fashion
of
looking
at
things
which
i
envy
you
i
assure
you
that
i
am
not
laughing
at
you
you
believe
if
i
understand
you
that
after
your
death
you
will
meet
her
again
you
are
afraid
that
if
i
die
before
you
she
will
belong
to
me
but
that
if
you
die
first
you
will
be
with
her
again
as
you
were
the
beginning
is
not
that
so
i
did
not
answer
him
i
swear
to
you
he
continued
that
i
am
not
mocking
you
what
my
own
thoughts
may
be
does
not
interest
you
but
i
have
not
in
my
life
found
many
things
or
persons
that
are
worth
one
devotion
and
she
was
worthy
of
being
loved
as
you
love
her
such
days
as
these
in
such
a
place
as
this
must
bring
strange
thoughts
to
any
man
when
we
return
to
mittövo
night
i
assure
you
that
you
will
see
everything
differently
he
felt
i
suppose
that
he
had
been
speaking
too
seriously
because
the
ironic
humour
with
which
he
always
treated
me
returned
here
at
any
rate
we
are
i
sorry
for
you
tiresome
to
be
tied
to
some
one
as
uncongenial
as
myself
but
be
a
little
sorry
for
me
too
you
not
you
know
the
ideal
companion
i
would
have
chosen
why
did
you
come
i
asked
him
durward
was
here
we
were
doing
very
well
without
me
he
caught
me
up
yes
i
suppose
so
but
your
fascination
is
so
strong
that
he
broke
off
laughing
then
continued
almost
sharply
here
we
are
anyway
and
we
are
going
to
be
lively
enough
if
i
know
anything
about
it
i
do
you
the
justice
of
saying
you
worked
admirably
here
i
would
have
believed
it
of
you
let
us
both
of
us
drop
our
romantic
fancies
no
time
to
spare
then
turning
at
the
door
he
ended
and
you
need
hate
me
so
badly
you
know
she
cared
for
you
in
a
way
that
she
never
gave
perhaps
after
all
in
the
end
you
will
win
he
gave
me
one
last
word
all
the
same
i
do
give
her
up
to
you
he
said
when
i
came
downstairs
again
it
was
to
find
confusion
and
noise
in
the
first
place
little
andrey
vassilievitch
was
quarrelling
loudly
with
nikitin
he
was
speaking
russian
very
fast
and
i
did
not
discover
his
complaint
there
was
something
comic
in
the
sight
of
his
small
body
towering
to
a
perfect
tempest
of
rage
his
plump
hands
gesticulating
and
always
his
eyes
anxious
and
doing
their
best
to
look
after
his
dignity
nikitin
explained
to
me
that
he
had
been
urging
andrey
vassilievitch
to
return
to
mittövo
with
the
wagons
there
no
need
he
said
for
us
all
to
stay
it
only
taking
unnecessary
risks
and
somebody
should
take
charge
of
the
wagons
there
feodor
constantinovitch
said
andrey
naming
a
feldscher
and
stammering
in
his
rage
he
enough
then
seeing
that
he
was
creating
something
of
a
scene
he
relapsed
into
a
dignified
sulkiness
finally
said
he
would
not
go
and
strutted
away
there
were
many
other
disturbances
men
coming
and
going
one
of
the
battery
officers
appearing
for
a
moment
dirty
and
dishevelled
and
always
the
wounded
drowsy
or
in
delirium
watching
with
dull
eyes
the
evening
shadows
talking
excitedly
in
their
sleep
semyonov
called
me
to
help
in
the
operating
room
within
the
next
two
hours
he
had
carried
out
two
amputations
with
admirable
cool
composure
during
the
second
one
when
the
man
arm
tumbled
off
into
the
basin
and
lay
there
amongst
the
filthy
rags
with
the
dirty
white
fingers
curved
their
nails
dead
and
grey
i
suddenly
felt
violently
sick
a
sanitar
took
my
place
and
i
went
out
into
the
cool
of
the
forest
where
a
silver
pattern
of
stars
swung
now
above
the
branches
and
a
full
moon
red
and
cold
was
rising
beyond
the
hill
after
a
time
i
felt
better
and
finding
that
i
was
not
needed
for
a
time
i
wrote
this
diary
august
it
is
just
six
a
most
lovely
evening
strangely
enough
everything
is
utterly
quiet
not
a
sound
anywhere
you
might
fancy
yourself
in
the
depths
of
england
somewhere
however
considering
what
has
happened
and
what
they
expect
will
happen
now
at
any
moment
the
strain
on
our
nerves
is
pretty
severe
and
as
usual
at
such
times
i
will
fill
in
my
diary
this
is
probably
the
last
time
that
i
write
it
here
as
we
move
as
soon
as
the
wagons
return
which
should
be
in
about
two
hours
from
now
all
our
things
are
packed
and
i
shall
slip
this
book
into
my
bag
as
soon
as
i
have
written
this
entry
but
i
have
probably
two
or
three
hours
clear
for
writing
as
everything
is
ready
for
departure
meanwhile
i
am
wonderfully
tranquil
and
at
peace
able
too
to
think
clearly
and
rationally
for
the
first
time
since
marie
death
i
want
to
give
an
account
of
the
events
since
my
last
entry
minutely
and
as
truthfully
as
my
memory
allows
me
at
about
eleven
last
night
semyonov
and
i
went
up
to
our
bedroom
to
sleep
nikitin
being
on
duty
there
was
not
much
noise
the
cannon
sounding
a
considerable
distance
away
but
the
flashlights
and
rockets
against
the
were
wonderful
and
when
we
had
blown
out
the
candle
our
dark
little
room
leapt
up
and
down
or
turned
round
and
round
the
window
flashing
into
vision
and
out
again
semyonov
was
almost
immediately
asleep
but
i
lay
on
my
back
and
of
course
as
usual
thought
of
marie
my
headache
of
the
evening
still
raged
furiously
and
i
was
in
desperately
low
spirits
i
had
been
able
to
eat
nothing
during
the
preceding
day
i
lay
there
half
asleep
half
awake
for
i
suppose
a
long
time
hearing
the
window
rattle
sometimes
when
the
cannon
was
noisy
and
feeling
under
the
jerky
reflections
on
the
wall
as
though
i
were
in
an
old
shambling
cab
driving
along
a
dark
road
i
thought
a
good
deal
about
that
talk
with
semyonov
that
i
had
what
a
strange
man
but
then
i
do
not
understand
him
at
all
i
think
i
understand
any
russian
such
a
mixture
of
hardness
and
softness
as
they
are
kind
and
then
indifferent
cruel
and
then
sentimental
but
i
understand
people
very
little
and
in
all
my
years
at
polchester
there
was
never
one
single
person
whom
i
knew
semyonov
is
perfectly
right
i
suppose
from
his
point
of
view
to
think
me
a
fool
i
lay
there
thinking
of
semyonov
he
was
sleeping
on
his
back
looking
very
big
under
the
clothes
his
beard
square
and
stiff
lit
up
by
the
flashing
light
and
then
sinking
into
darkness
again
i
thought
of
him
and
of
myself
and
of
the
strange
contrast
that
we
were
and
how
queer
it
was
that
the
same
woman
should
have
cared
for
both
of
us
and
i
know
that
although
i
did
not
hate
him
at
all
i
would
give
almost
anything
for
him
not
to
have
been
there
never
to
have
been
there
whilst
he
was
there
i
knew
that
i
had
no
chance
marie
had
not
laughed
at
me
during
those
days
at
petrograd
she
had
believed
in
me
then
and
i
had
been
worth
believing
in
if
people
had
believed
in
me
more
i
might
be
a
very
different
man
now
i
was
almost
asleep
scarcely
conscious
of
the
room
when
suddenly
i
heard
a
voice
cry
marie
marie
marie
three
times
it
was
a
voice
that
i
had
never
heard
before
strong
but
also
tender
full
of
pain
with
a
note
in
it
too
of
a
struggling
that
would
break
in
a
moment
and
overwhelm
its
possessor
as
i
look
back
at
it
i
remember
that
i
felt
the
passion
and
strength
in
it
so
violently
that
i
seemed
to
shrink
into
myself
as
though
i
were
witnessing
something
that
no
man
should
see
and
as
though
also
i
were
conscious
of
my
own
weakness
and
insignificance
it
was
semyonov
the
flashlight
flashed
into
the
room
shining
for
an
instant
upon
him
he
was
sitting
up
in
bed
his
shirt
open
and
his
chest
bare
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
window
but
he
was
fast
asleep
he
seemed
to
me
a
new
man
i
had
grown
so
accustomed
to
his
sarcasm
his
irony
that
i
had
almost
persuaded
myself
that
he
had
never
truly
loved
marie
but
had
felt
some
sensual
attraction
for
her
that
would
by
realisation
have
been
at
once
satisfied
this
was
another
man
here
was
a
struggle
an
agony
that
was
not
for
such
men
as
i
he
cried
again
marie
marie
then
got
up
out
of
bed
walked
on
his
naked
feet
in
his
shirt
to
the
window
stood
there
and
waited
the
moonlight
had
by
this
struck
our
room
and
flooded
it
he
turned
suddenly
and
faced
me
i
could
not
believe
that
he
did
not
see
me
but
i
could
not
endure
the
unhappiness
in
his
eyes
and
i
turned
looking
down
i
did
not
look
at
him
again
but
i
heard
his
feet
patter
back
to
the
bed
then
he
stood
there
his
whole
body
strung
to
meet
some
overmastering
crisis
he
whispered
her
name
as
though
she
had
come
to
him
since
his
first
call
ah
marie
my
darling
he
whispered
i
could
not
bear
that
i
crept
from
my
bed
slipped
away
closed
the
door
softly
behind
me
and
stole
downstairs
i
can
not
write
at
length
of
what
followed
it
was
the
crisis
of
everything
that
has
happened
to
me
since
i
left
petrograd
every
experience
that
i
had
had
was
suddenly
flung
into
this
moment
i
was
in
our
now
pitch
dark
because
shutters
had
been
placed
outside
the
windows
to
guard
against
bullets
i
stood
there
in
my
shirt
and
drawers
shuddering
shivering
with
hatred
of
myself
shivering
with
fear
of
semyonov
shivering
above
all
with
a
desperate
agonising
torturing
hunger
for
marie
semyonov
voice
had
appalled
me
i
had
realised
before
how
strongly
i
had
relied
on
his
not
truly
caring
for
her
everything
in
the
man
had
seemed
to
persuade
me
of
this
and
i
had
even
flattered
myself
on
my
miserable
superiority
to
him
that
i
was
the
true
faithful
lover
and
he
the
vulgar
sensualist
how
small
now
i
seemed
beside
him
and
how
i
feared
him
then
i
was
at
sudden
fierce
grip
with
the
beast
at
grips
at
last
i
had
once
before
on
another
night
been
tempted
to
kill
myself
but
that
had
been
nothing
to
this
now
sick
and
ill
faint
for
food
i
swayed
there
on
the
floor
hearing
always
in
my
ear
give
way
give
way
you
be
in
front
of
him
you
have
left
him
behind
you
he
can
do
nothing
a
moment
more
and
you
can
be
with
her
and
he
can
not
reach
you
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
fought
there
i
was
not
fighting
with
an
evil
devil
a
fearful
beast
as
in
my
dreams
i
had
always
imagined
it
i
was
fighting
myself
every
weakness
in
the
past
to
which
i
had
ever
surrendered
every
little
scrap
of
personal
history
every
slackness
and
cowardice
and
lethargy
was
there
on
the
floor
against
me
i
do
know
what
it
was
that
prevented
me
stealing
back
to
my
room
fetching
my
revolver
and
so
ending
it
i
could
see
marie
close
to
me
to
be
reached
by
the
stretching
of
a
finger
i
could
see
myself
living
on
always
conscious
of
semyonov
his
thick
beastly
confident
body
always
there
between
myself
and
her
i
sank
into
the
last
depths
of
and
degradation
no
fine
thing
saved
me
no
help
from
noble
principles
nothing
fine
the
whole
was
as
sordid
as
possible
i
knew
even
as
i
struggled
that
i
was
a
silly
figure
there
with
my
bony
ugliness
in
my
shirt
and
drawers
my
hair
on
end
and
my
teeth
chattering
but
i
responded
i
suppose
to
some
little
pulse
of
manly
obstinacy
that
beat
somewhere
in
me
i
would
be
beaten
by
the
creature
even
in
the
middle
of
it
i
realised
that
this
was
the
hardest
tussle
of
my
life
and
worth
fighting
i
know
too
that
some
thought
of
nikitin
came
to
me
as
though
in
some
way
my
failure
would
damage
i
remembered
that
night
of
the
retreat
when
he
had
helped
me
and
as
though
he
were
appealing
visibly
to
me
there
in
the
room
i
responded
i
seemed
to
feel
that
he
was
fighting
some
battle
of
his
own
and
that
my
victory
would
fortify
him
i
stood
with
him
beside
me
so
i
fought
it
fought
it
with
the
sweat
dripping
down
my
nose
and
my
tongue
dry
no
something
suddenly
cried
in
me
if
she
his
she
his
i
will
not
take
her
this
way
then
in
a
snivelling
miserable
fashion
i
began
to
cry
simply
from
exhaustion
and
nerves
and
headache
i
slipped
down
into
a
chair
i
sat
there
feeling
utterly
beaten
and
yet
in
some
dim
way
as
one
hears
a
trumpet
sounding
behind
a
range
of
hills
i
was
triumphant
there
with
my
head
on
the
table
and
my
nose
i
believe
in
a
plate
left
from
some
one
last
night
supper
i
slept
a
heavy
dreamless
sleep
i
woke
and
heard
a
clock
in
the
room
strike
three
i
got
up
stretched
my
arms
yawned
and
knew
that
my
head
was
clear
and
my
brain
at
peace
i
ca
describe
my
feelings
better
than
by
saying
that
it
was
as
though
i
had
put
my
brain
and
my
heart
and
all
my
fears
and
terrors
under
a
good
stiff
pump
of
cold
water
i
felt
a
different
man
from
four
hours
before
although
still
desperately
tired
and
physically
weak
i
went
softly
upstairs
the
light
of
a
most
lovely
summer
morning
flooded
the
room
semyonov
was
lying
sleeping
like
a
child
his
head
pillowed
on
his
arm
very
cautiously
i
dressed
then
went
downstairs
again
i
did
not
understand
now
the
peace
and
happiness
in
my
heart
all
the
time
i
was
saying
to
myself
why
am
i
so
happy
why
am
i
so
happy
the
world
was
marvellously
fresh
with
little
white
glittering
clouds
above
the
trees
the
grass
wet
and
shining
and
the
sky
a
high
dome
of
blue
light
like
the
inside
of
a
glass
bell
that
has
the
sun
behind
it
here
and
there
on
the
outskirts
of
the
forest
fires
were
still
dimly
burning
pale
and
dim
yellow
shadows
beneath
the
sun
men
wrapped
in
their
coats
were
sleeping
in
little
groups
under
the
trees
horses
cropped
at
the
grass
soldiers
were
moving
with
buckets
of
water
two
men
at
the
very
edge
of
the
forest
stripped
to
the
waist
were
washing
in
a
pool
that
was
like
a
blue
handkerchief
in
the
great
forest
of
green
i
found
a
little
glade
very
bright
and
fresh
under
a
group
of
silver
birch
and
there
i
lay
down
on
my
back
my
hands
behind
my
head
looking
up
into
the
little
dancing
atoms
of
blue
between
the
trees
and
the
golden
stars
of
sunlight
that
flashed
and
sparkled
there
happiness
and
peace
wrapped
me
round
i
can
not
pretend
to
disentangle
and
produce
in
proper
sequence
all
the
thoughts
and
memories
that
floated
into
my
vision
and
away
again
but
i
know
that
whereas
before
thoughts
had
attacked
me
as
though
they
were
foul
animals
biting
at
my
brain
now
i
seemed
myself
gently
to
invite
my
memories
many
scenes
from
my
polchester
days
that
i
had
long
forgotten
came
back
to
me
i
was
indeed
startled
by
the
clearness
with
which
i
saw
that
earlier
figure
the
very
awkward
careless
ugly
boy
listening
lazily
to
other
people
plans
taking
shelter
from
life
under
a
vague
love
of
beauty
and
an
idle
imagination
the
man
awkward
and
ugly
sensitive
because
of
his
own
wasting
his
hours
through
his
own
which
paralysed
all
effort
still
trusting
to
his
idle
love
of
beauty
to
pull
him
through
to
some
superior
standard
complaining
of
life
but
never
trying
to
get
the
better
of
it
then
the
man
who
came
to
russia
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
still
always
given
up
to
timid
but
responding
now
a
little
to
the
new
scenes
the
new
temperament
the
new
chances
then
this
man
feeling
that
at
last
he
was
rid
of
all
the
tiresome
encumbrances
of
the
earlier
years
lets
himself
go
falls
in
love
worships
dreams
for
a
few
days
a
wonderful
dream
then
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
begins
to
fight
i
saw
all
the
steps
so
clearly
and
i
saw
every
little
thought
every
little
action
every
little
opportunity
missed
or
taken
accumulating
until
the
moment
of
climax
four
hours
before
i
seemed
to
have
brought
polchester
on
my
back
to
the
war
and
i
could
see
quite
clearly
how
each
of
us
marie
semyonov
nikitin
durward
every
one
of
us
had
brought
private
histories
and
scenes
with
war
is
made
up
i
believe
not
of
shells
and
bullets
not
of
german
defeats
and
victories
russian
triumphs
or
surrenders
english
and
french
battles
by
sea
and
land
not
of
smoke
and
wounds
and
blood
but
of
a
million
million
past
thoughts
past
scenes
streets
of
little
country
towns
lonely
hills
dark
sheltered
valleys
the
wide
space
of
the
sea
the
crowded
traffic
of
new
york
london
berlin
yes
and
of
smaller
things
than
that
of
little
quarrels
of
dances
at
christmas
time
of
walks
at
night
of
dressing
for
dinner
of
waking
in
the
morning
of
meeting
old
friends
of
sicknesses
theatres
church
services
prostitutes
slums
children
rides
on
a
tram
baths
on
a
hot
morning
sudden
unpleasant
truth
from
a
friend
momentary
consciousness
of
god
death
too
how
clear
now
it
was
to
me
during
these
weeks
i
had
wondered
pursued
the
thought
of
death
was
it
this
was
it
that
was
it
pain
was
it
terror
i
had
feared
it
as
for
instance
when
i
had
seen
the
dead
bodies
in
the
forest
or
stood
under
the
rain
at
nijnieff
i
had
laughed
at
it
as
when
i
had
gone
with
the
sanitars
i
had
cursed
it
as
when
marie
ivanovna
had
died
i
had
sought
it
as
i
had
done
last
night
and
always
as
i
drew
closer
and
closer
to
it
fancied
it
some
fine
allegorical
figure
something
terrible
appalling
devastating
how
when
i
was
as
i
believed
at
last
face
to
face
with
it
i
saw
that
one
was
simply
face
to
face
with
oneself
four
hours
i
have
been
writing
and
no
sign
of
the
wagons
i
am
writing
everything
down
as
i
remember
it
because
these
things
are
so
clear
to
me
now
and
yet
i
know
that
afterwards
they
will
be
changed
twisted
i
was
drowsy
i
saw
polchester
high
street
garth
in
roselands
clinton
truxe
best
of
all
rafiel
i
went
down
the
high
white
hill
deep
into
the
valley
then
along
the
road
beside
the
stream
where
the
houses
begin
the
hideous
wesleyan
chapel
on
my
right
ebenezer
villa
on
my
left
then
the
cottages
with
the
gardens
then
the
little
street
the
the
butcher
the
turn
of
the
road
and
suddenly
the
bay
with
the
fishing
boats
riding
at
anchor
and
beyond
the
sea
england
and
russia
to
their
strong
and
confident
union
i
thought
that
i
would
give
every
drop
of
my
blood
every
beat
of
my
heart
and
as
i
lay
there
i
seemed
to
see
on
one
side
the
deep
green
lanes
at
rafiel
and
on
the
other
the
shining
canals
the
little
wooden
houses
the
cobbler
and
the
tufted
trees
of
petrograd
the
sea
coast
beyond
truxe
and
the
wide
plains
beyond
moscow
the
cathedral
at
polchester
and
the
kremlin
breeding
their
children
to
the
hundredth
generation
for
the
same
hopes
the
same
beliefs
the
same
desires
i
slept
in
the
sun
and
had
happy
dreams
i
have
these
last
pages
and
i
find
some
very
fine
stuff
about
giving
every
drop
of
blood
etc
of
course
i
am
not
that
kind
of
man
men
like
durward
and
myself
he
resembles
me
in
many
ways
although
he
is
stronger
than
i
am
and
does
care
what
people
think
of
him
are
too
analytical
and
to
give
much
of
their
blood
to
anybody
or
to
make
their
blood
of
very
much
value
if
they
did
i
only
meant
that
i
would
do
my
best
later
in
the
morning
the
firing
began
again
pretty
close
andrey
vassilievitch
came
to
me
and
wanted
to
talk
to
me
i
was
rather
short
with
him
because
i
was
busy
he
wanted
to
tell
me
that
he
hoped
i
had
misunderstood
his
quarrel
with
nikitin
last
night
it
had
been
nothing
at
all
his
nerves
had
been
rather
out
of
order
he
was
very
much
better
felt
quite
another
man
he
another
man
and
i
said
so
he
said
that
i
did
strange
but
i
felt
as
i
looked
at
him
that
he
was
sickening
for
some
bad
illness
one
feels
that
sometimes
about
people
without
being
able
to
name
a
cause
i
have
an
affection
for
the
little
man
but
he
an
awful
fool
well
so
am
i
but
fools
never
respect
fools
strange
to
see
semyonov
i
had
expected
him
for
some
reason
to
be
different
just
the
same
of
course
very
sarcastic
to
me
i
had
a
hole
in
one
of
my
pockets
and
was
always
forgetting
and
putting
money
and
things
into
it
this
seemed
to
annoy
him
but
nothing
matters
even
the
flies
do
not
worry
me
all
the
morning
marie
has
seemed
so
close
to
me
i
have
a
strange
excitement
the
feeling
that
one
has
when
one
is
in
a
train
that
approaches
the
place
where
some
one
whom
one
loves
is
waiting
i
feel
exactly
as
though
i
were
going
on
a
journey
since
three
we
had
a
lively
time
the
attack
began
about
five
minutes
to
three
by
a
shell
splashing
into
the
forest
near
our
battery
no
one
killed
fortunately
they
simply
stormed
away
since
then
i
do
seem
to
be
able
to
realise
it
and
have
been
sitting
in
my
room
writing
as
though
they
were
a
hundred
miles
away
one
so
used
to
the
noise
everything
is
ready
we
got
all
the
wounded
prepared
if
only
the
wagons
would
come
hallo
a
shell
in
the
garden
cracked
one
of
these
windows
i
must
go
down
to
see
whether
any
one
touched
i
put
this
in
my
bag
and
i
am
so
happy
that
the
end
of
trenchard
diary
these
are
the
last
words
in
trenchard
journal
it
fills
about
half
the
second
exercise
book
the
last
pages
are
written
in
a
hand
very
much
clearer
and
steadier
than
the
earlier
ones
i
would
like
now
to
make
my
account
as
brief
as
possible
upon
the
afternoon
of
august
we
were
all
at
mittövo
extremely
anxious
about
our
friends
molozov
was
in
a
great
state
of
alarm
the
sanitars
with
the
wagons
that
arrived
at
about
four
in
the
afternoon
told
us
that
a
violent
attack
in
the
intermediate
neighbourhood
of
our
white
house
was
expected
at
any
moment
the
wagons
were
to
return
as
quickly
as
possible
and
bring
every
one
away
they
left
about
five
in
charge
of
molozov
and
goga
who
were
bursting
with
excitement
i
knew
that
they
could
not
be
with
us
again
until
at
any
rate
nine
but
i
was
so
nervous
that
at
about
seven
i
walked
out
to
the
cross
and
watched
it
was
a
very
dark
night
but
the
sky
was
simply
on
fire
with
searchlights
and
rockets
very
fine
behind
the
forest
and
reflected
in
the
river
the
cannonade
was
incessant
but
one
could
not
tell
how
close
it
was
at
last
at
about
eight
i
could
endure
my
ignorance
no
longer
and
i
went
down
the
hill
towards
the
bridge
i
had
not
been
there
more
than
ten
minutes
and
had
just
seen
a
shell
burst
with
a
magnificent
spurt
of
fire
high
in
the
wood
opposite
when
our
wagons
suddenly
clattered
up
out
of
the
darkness
i
saw
at
once
that
something
was
wrong
the
horses
were
being
driven
furiously
although
there
was
now
no
need
as
i
thought
for
haste
i
could
just
see
semyonov
in
the
half
light
and
he
shouted
something
to
me
i
caught
one
of
the
wagons
as
it
passed
and
nearly
crushed
goga
we
were
making
so
much
noise
that
i
had
to
shout
to
him
well
i
cried
then
i
saw
that
he
was
crying
his
arms
folded
about
his
face
sobbing
like
a
little
boy
what
is
it
i
shouted
mr
he
said
andrey
vassilievitch
i
looked
round
one
of
the
sanitars
nodded
then
there
followed
a
nightmare
of
which
i
can
remember
very
little
it
seems
that
at
about
four
in
the
afternoon
the
austrians
made
a
furious
attack
at
about
seven
our
men
retreated
and
broke
they
were
gradually
beaten
back
towards
the
river
then
out
of
mittövo
the
moskovsky
polk
made
a
magnificent
rallied
the
other
division
and
finally
drove
the
austrians
right
back
to
their
original
trenches
from
nine
until
twelve
we
were
in
the
thick
of
it
after
midnight
all
was
quiet
again
i
will
not
give
you
details
of
our
experiences
as
they
are
not
all
to
my
present
purpose
at
about
one
in
the
morning
i
found
nikitin
standing
in
the
garden
looking
in
front
of
him
across
the
river
over
which
a
very
faint
light
was
beginning
to
break
i
touched
him
on
the
arm
and
he
started
as
though
he
had
been
very
far
away
how
did
trenchard
die
he
answered
at
once
very
readily
about
three
the
shells
were
close
the
wagons
arrived
a
little
before
seven
so
we
had
fully
four
anxious
hours
we
had
had
everything
ready
all
the
afternoon
and
of
course
just
then
we
could
go
out
to
fetch
the
wounded
and
i
think
that
the
army
sanitars
were
working
in
another
direction
so
that
we
had
nothing
to
do
which
was
pretty
trying
i
did
see
until
just
before
seven
he
had
been
busy
upstairs
about
something
and
then
at
the
sound
of
the
wagons
he
came
out
i
had
noticed
that
all
day
he
had
seemed
very
much
quieter
and
more
cheerful
he
had
been
in
a
wretched
condition
on
the
earlier
days
nervous
and
and
i
was
very
glad
to
see
him
so
much
better
we
were
all
working
then
moving
the
wounded
from
the
house
to
the
wagons
we
hear
one
another
speak
the
noise
was
so
terrific
andrey
and
were
directing
the
sanitars
near
the
house
semyonov
and
i
were
near
the
wagons
i
had
looked
up
and
shouted
something
to
andrey
when
suddenly
i
heard
a
shell
that
seemed
as
though
it
would
break
right
over
me
i
braced
myself
as
one
does
to
meet
it
for
a
moment
i
heard
nothing
but
the
noise
my
nostrils
were
choked
with
the
smell
and
my
eyes
blinded
with
dust
but
i
knew
that
i
had
not
been
hit
and
i
stood
there
rather
stupidly
wondering
then
cleared
i
saw
that
all
the
right
corner
of
the
house
was
gone
and
that
semyonov
had
run
forward
and
was
kneeling
on
the
ground
with
all
the
shouting
and
firing
it
was
very
difficult
to
realise
anything
i
ran
to
semyonov
andrey
but
i
wo
i
ca
he
must
have
been
right
under
the
thing
and
was
blown
to
pieces
strangely
enough
lying
there
with
his
arms
spread
out
seemed
to
have
been
scarcely
touched
but
i
saw
at
once
when
i
came
to
him
that
he
had
only
a
few
moments
to
live
he
had
a
terrible
stomach
wound
but
was
suffering
no
pain
i
think
semyonov
was
kneeling
with
his
arm
behind
his
head
looking
straight
into
his
eyes
he
said
several
times
as
though
he
wanted
to
rouse
him
to
consciousness
then
quite
suddenly
seemed
to
realise
he
looked
at
semyonov
and
smiled
one
of
those
rather
timid
shy
smiles
that
were
so
customary
with
him
his
eyes
though
were
not
timid
they
were
filled
with
the
strangest
look
of
triumph
and
expectation
the
two
men
looked
at
one
another
and
i
seeing
that
nothing
was
to
be
done
waited
semyonov
then
speaking
as
though
he
and
were
alone
in
all
this
world
of
noise
and
confusion
said
won
mr
you
won
he
repeated
this
several
times
as
though
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
that
should
realise
his
words
smiling
looked
at
semyonov
gave
a
little
sigh
and
died
i
can
hear
now
the
tones
of
semyonov
voice
there
was
something
so
strange
in
its
mixture
of
irony
bitterness
and
kindness
just
that
rather
contemptible
patronising
kindness
that
is
so
especially
his
we
had
no
time
to
wait
after
that
we
got
the
wagons
out
by
a
miracle
without
losing
a
man
semyonov
was
marvellous
in
his
and
coolness
we
were
both
silent
for
a
long
time
nikitin
only
once
again
andrey
my
god
how
i
will
miss
him
he
said
and
i
who
knew
how
often
he
had
cursed
the
little
man
and
been
impatient
with
his
importunities
understood
i
have
lost
more
far
more
than
andrey
he
said
i
talked
to
you
once
ivan
andreievitch
you
will
understand
that
i
have
no
one
now
who
can
bring
her
to
me
i
think
that
she
will
never
come
to
me
alone
i
never
needed
her
as
he
did
no
more
dreams
we
were
interrupted
by
semyonov
who
carrying
a
lantern
passed
us
he
saw
us
and
turned
back
we
must
be
ready
by
seven
he
said
sharply
a
general
retirement
ivan
andreievitch
do
you
know
whether
had
friends
or
relations
to
whom
we
can
write
i
heard
of
nobody
i
answered
nobody
nobody
just
before
he
turned
my
eyes
met
his
he
appeared
to
me
as
a
man
who
with
all
his
was
compelling
himself
to
meet
the
onset
of
an
immeasurable
devastating
loss
he
gave
us
a
careless
nod
and
vanished
into
the
darkness
